1
00:00:01,659 --> 00:00:07,769
Oh, this is a disaster. I don't even have my lip balm. This is a disaster. Give me one second.

2
00:00:07,769 --> 00:00:54,090
This is a disaster. One sec. This is like the weirdest tweet I think I've ever made.

3
00:00:56,119 --> 00:01:05,909
Fucking weird tweet. You laugh, you lose in baby sensory videos today. I've come a long way from

4
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:22,090
I'm playing Spy on Upward today. What's going on here? Okay, my mic's in a weird place. I got

5
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:27,349
some new monitors and I'm in the process of making them, getting them set up in a good spot.

6
00:01:27,989 --> 00:01:35,590
And I messed up where my microphone is. I can't even stream yet. I can't even stream today. I'm

7
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:47,340
gone. This is too much. This is too much for me. I'm gonna go. Okay, I gave you some updates on

8
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:51,099
some things because I think you deserve them. It's been four or five days since I've said hello to

9
00:01:51,099 --> 00:02:00,870
you. An update on the New Year's Eve stuff. I, the, this dominations obviously have been closed for

10
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:05,750
about a week. Going through the process of eliminating a bunch of these

11
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:11,110
nominees has been ridiculous considering, if I'm accurate, I believe there were,

12
00:02:12,229 --> 00:02:17,590
and this is going after going through a first pass through, right? So everybody nominates shit.

13
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:22,949
We do a first pass through of, okay, duplicates and stuff that just really doesn't belong there

14
00:02:22,949 --> 00:02:27,500
in that category. It doesn't belong here. No, no, no, not this one. After the first pass through,

15
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:35,960
there's like, I think like 50 best noise nominees that are still there. So I, it's gonna, I have to,

16
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:44,729
I have to do a lot of reducing. If I can get it down to like 20, have I really, I don't,

17
00:02:44,729 --> 00:02:57,370
have I made that many? I remember somebody said, what's your official comment on the egg stream?

18
00:02:59,669 --> 00:03:05,110
I streamed myself eating like hard boiled eggs or something as an incentive of like dying in

19
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:07,909
Team Fortress. I don't know, it was like, it was like eight, it was like nine years ago.

20
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:33,979
Make a best noise, do it again. No, please hurry. Let me get some updates. Updates, updates, updates,

21
00:03:33,979 --> 00:03:37,659
updates, updates. You peaked on the egg stream. Well, that's weird considering I think there were

22
00:03:37,659 --> 00:03:44,919
like 40 people on that stream. Interesting that I thought I had a little bit, a little bit higher

23
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:54,659
view numbers than that now. Okay. So here's what we're going to do. What? I didn't even update you.

24
00:03:54,659 --> 00:03:59,060
Okay. So I'm going to say something that might sound a little,

25
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:05,539
there might be some shocked faces here, but the nature of how many nominees have come in,

26
00:04:06,259 --> 00:04:11,509
I'm not saying this yet. I have not said this yet. So don't quote me on this, but just like put it

27
00:04:11,509 --> 00:04:20,790
in brackets and then quote it. I might not do it on New Year's Eve. We might be one of those like

28
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:25,029
January, like there for, there's a dead pixel on this monitor. I just got it.

29
00:04:26,459 --> 00:04:39,220
What is it? I got a dead pixel right in front of me. It's just a green dot. Come on. Oh, that sucks.

30
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:52,250
That actually sucks. Maybe. I mean, okay. Come on. Really? I didn't see it. I didn't see it here

31
00:04:52,250 --> 00:05:02,500
before. You mad about one pixel. Yeah. I mean, when you, when you spend the money on one of these

32
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:09,449
monitors, reset it. Sometimes dead pixels kind of just out of there. And then they,

33
00:05:09,449 --> 00:05:17,259
they just kind of flicker out, right? That's annoying. All right. The monitor is a, I got a

34
00:05:17,259 --> 00:05:24,250
predator. I don't know the company. I actually don't even remember the company's name. I don't

35
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:32,490
know. Is it a Zeus? Asus? I don't know. I don't know what, what, who made this Acer is an Acer

36
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:39,459
predator. And it's, I turned it on. It was pretty good, but whatever. We'll, we'll, I won't complain

37
00:05:39,459 --> 00:05:49,879
about that right now. Asus. Yeah. No, they don't. I don't know. So, all right. So I don't know. I'm

38
00:05:49,879 --> 00:05:53,319
not sure if I want to move it like a few days just to make sure we have everything good. I have not

39
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:57,319
said that yet. I might just do double time here in the next few days to make sure that that actually

40
00:05:57,319 --> 00:06:04,120
happens. Cause there's also rumble too. So we'll see if I get it on New Year's Eve, but don't be

41
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:09,930
surprised if it's like two or three days into the new year. We'll see. I have not committed to that

42
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:16,550
yet. I'm going to try. I'm not canceling it. No, no way. So what we're doing today is something

43
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:23,100
I've been talking about for a long time. It is a, let me turn my light on. So this stream is going

44
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:29,240
to be a, you laugh, you lose. I've never done it before. There's been a list of meme videos and

45
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:33,879
there's a, there's a playlist that I'm about to watch. It's got like 200 videos on it or something.

46
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:41,720
And it's just memes and funny shit. And we'll see if it gets me. If I laugh, we have a few incentives

47
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:49,420
next summer. I do. I, I think I just read that completely wrong. My microphone's in the wrong

48
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:53,740
place. And there's a dead pixel on my monitor. This is too much for me. I think I'm done.

49
00:06:54,779 --> 00:07:02,300
Okay. So eat an egg sandwich. No, no, no. Then I'm not doing like incentives where if I laugh three

50
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:10,779
times, I have to do a headstand and drink a glass of milk. No. I am, I am like the uncle on Christmas

51
00:07:10,779 --> 00:07:17,589
that doesn't buy presents for anybody. He just shows up with cash. Here you go. Here you go.

52
00:07:17,589 --> 00:07:25,139
And here you go. That's $50 for each of you. So here's what we're going to do. Uh,

53
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:32,120
I'm going to make a pool of money every time I laugh and it has to be an audible laugh. It can't

54
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:43,379
be, I know look smiling. You're the best uncle ever. Yeah. No smiling, no smirks, no like,

55
00:07:46,459 --> 00:07:48,620
you know what I'm talking about? None of that. It has to be like,

56
00:07:52,379 --> 00:07:58,500
that's what we're talking about. We could do, we could change these rules a little bit out when

57
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:01,779
we get closer. Cause I have, I get, I'm going to pause it. I get to pause it at least a few times.

58
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:08,259
I don't think, no belly laugh only. I don't think so. It doesn't have to be a belly laugh.

59
00:08:08,259 --> 00:08:15,269
It just has to be very clearly. I have like, I'm like, I've laughed. I will accept, um,

60
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:22,279
like if my mouth opens and a bunch of air comes out and it's like, that counts.

61
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:29,910
Face cam. Well, of course I'm going to do a face cam. So, but after that, we're going to watch a

62
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:37,529
few baby sensory videos. Um, I have found some, I've got about like half dozen, I think or so.

63
00:08:37,529 --> 00:08:42,309
They're all, they're all pretty long and I don't know how this can play out. They look

64
00:08:42,309 --> 00:08:49,320
fucking really weird. I am also considering, uh, activating what I would call hard mode.

65
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:57,240
Um, for myself, I'm going to just kind of hang out for a little bit and hard mode might activate

66
00:08:57,799 --> 00:09:04,360
and, uh, it'll be hard to do this. It's, I might activate hard mode.

67
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,720
Well, I will see. I don't know if I'm going to activate hard mode.

68
00:09:13,129 --> 00:09:23,610
Difficulty difficulty. What the fuck? So I, let's switch it over here because

69
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:30,440
let's see what's going on now. I have it ready. I know the title and that this is a playlist.

70
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:35,320
So this is just going to go, by the way, for every time that I laugh or like the first,

71
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:39,850
we'll go with the first, maybe 30 minutes. I don't have like a brand necessarily a plan,

72
00:09:40,409 --> 00:09:44,230
but we're going to have a pool of money. And every time I laugh,

73
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:51,350
a hundred dollars is going to get added to that pool. Once the pool has been filled

74
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:58,460
at the end of the stream, I'm going to decide what is going to happen with that money.

75
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:11,909
A hundred dollars every time I laugh. I've never, yes, I'm, I'm like copy,

76
00:10:11,909 --> 00:10:15,190
copy cat Andy. All right. I've never done this before. It seemed like fun.

77
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:25,259
Yeah, there's this charity. There's yeah, I probably will. A majority of it will go to charity.

78
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:32,070
I have a few things that I've in mind, a few places in mind, so we'll figure it out.

79
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:39,799
But a hundred bucks gets added to that pool. So are you, are you ready? Am I? Well,

80
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:48,860
hold on. The better question is, am I ready? I, I don't know. We'll find out. And I know I might

81
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:51,820
look like, I might look like a little weird today because I have this like thing here.

82
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:57,769
I've got this light. Do I look like I'm looking like a low, but I've tried. You need to be able

83
00:10:57,769 --> 00:11:06,899
to see my face today. I don't care how shitty it looks. It's like a candle lit stream. Yeah.

84
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:12,659
It's very warm. And you see me well, right? You need to be able to see my face because if I go

85
00:11:12,659 --> 00:11:21,590
like, then you need to be able to pick it up. Is the cam too small? I don't want the cam to be

86
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:29,690
because we're about to put the playlist on. I think there's 200 videos in this playlist.

87
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:46,100
Well, I said charity pool, but we're just going to call it pool just for now. Pool. Okay. A hundred

88
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:54,039
bucks. If I, all right, can I get it out of my system right now? Like when, when does it start?

89
00:11:54,039 --> 00:12:03,299
I do look fucking evil. He's high. I've not activated hard mode. Hard mode is not going

90
00:12:03,299 --> 00:12:15,779
to activate as soon as I click play. Okay. What if I lose immediately? What happens? Oh, I had money.

91
00:12:15,779 --> 00:12:20,120
Okay. What can you make an incentive where if you laugh, you kiss the camera?

92
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:34,259
That is so weird. That's so fucked up. All right. That's the first incentive. If I laugh,

93
00:12:34,259 --> 00:12:42,460
I'll kiss the camera. You ready? Make sure you guys can, can you guys hear this? Don't spoil this.

94
00:12:43,799 --> 00:12:49,049
It doesn't count yet. I haven't really started. Some of these might be loud. Just be aware of

95
00:12:49,049 --> 00:13:06,139
that. I don't know. Okay. Here we go. Your wicked parasocial. What? I always tell people don't do

96
00:13:06,139 --> 00:13:09,980
that because I'm just a fucking weirdo that you don't know on the internet. You don't know me.

97
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:21,179
You don't even like me in real life. I guarantee it. All right. Here we go. One, two, three.

98
00:13:38,409 --> 00:13:43,259
Yeah. Holy shit. Wow.

99
00:13:49,259 --> 00:13:51,419
Um, there's some Scottish people that kind of say

100
00:13:51,419 --> 00:14:24,309
the

101
00:14:24,309 --> 00:14:29,929
I wasn't expecting Vince McMahon to show up. I put a hundred dollars in here. Oh no, it's kiss the

102
00:14:29,929 --> 00:14:48,409
camera. How do I do this without being weird? This is, I don't want to do this. I don't want

103
00:14:48,409 --> 00:15:01,210
to do this. Oh no. No, I don't think so. I was weird, isn't it? Okay. How about this?

104
00:15:04,409 --> 00:15:08,490
All right. I got it. I did it. I'm not doing that. Something like that again.

105
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:20,360
Oh, son of a bitch. Me, Austin. It was me all along, Austin.

106
00:15:46,549 --> 00:15:53,620
That was cute.

107
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:31,509
I thought this was a baby sensory video. I was about to laugh.

108
00:16:51,879 --> 00:17:21,559
Armand Christophe. Don't worry. We'll get him. Can I help you? We'll get him. What's he doing

109
00:17:21,559 --> 00:17:47,240
over there? That was closer than it was besides the Austin one. Oh, I am not drunk. I am not

110
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:58,549
fucking drunk. Can you tell the time? Yes. I am not fucking drunk.

111
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:11,109
This one's very interesting.

112
00:18:15,029 --> 00:18:33,400
I almost, I almost laughed at this because it was weird. Cover all 9,000 taste buds,

113
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:42,740
aerate it, warm it up, driving up that top note, that cream, pure vanilla,

114
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:53,910
sweeteners. That's a 10. I've seen this video a million times. I love it. Not this one in particular,

115
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:58,569
but

116
00:19:05,369 --> 00:19:08,329
I ain't never seen no muzzles on there, but it might be good though. My dad didn't know

117
00:19:08,329 --> 00:19:12,170
about it. I'm out of here to him all around and then I'm going to rub it smooth everywhere.

118
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:16,329
Mustard. Come on, man. I don't put no mustard. You need to put a little seed on that thing.

119
00:19:17,609 --> 00:19:22,329
What? Man, come on. Get that pep off there. Come on. Somebody come get this, man. Come on,

120
00:19:22,809 --> 00:19:28,009
come on. Get that pep off. That's just too much dog on pep. I don't really want to see this no more.

121
00:19:28,009 --> 00:19:32,490
That's really all you look for brisket. Oh my God.

122
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:45,240
We're good. We're good. We're good.

123
00:19:45,240 --> 00:20:10,519
Twitter stinks. I'm leaving.

124
00:20:12,119 --> 00:20:18,089
That just scared the shit out of me. That was weird. We saw people in the streets ready to put

125
00:20:18,089 --> 00:20:24,410
2018 in the rear view mirror and say hello to 2019. We also saw this dog with a banana.

126
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:28,809
A festive atmosphere in the heart of downtown Orlando is what it's all about.

127
00:20:29,769 --> 00:20:33,990
From the skyline, would you like to try our new chicken tendie and french fry combo?

128
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:53,059
Hell no. Can I get a chicken tendie combo, please? That was so stupid.

129
00:20:55,460 --> 00:21:02,339
What the fuck was that? That was just bizarre. Can I get a chicken tendie combo, please?

130
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:23,059
That was you working the drive-through. That was just weird. It was just like,

131
00:21:23,059 --> 00:21:34,680
why would somebody ever do something like that? Are you sitting in front of a fireplace? All right,

132
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:49,880
let me add it. What do they even say? You have the angel filter on. Okay, that's $100.

133
00:21:50,440 --> 00:22:00,980
I want to see this one again. Some of these I've seen. Some of these I've never seen before.

134
00:22:07,539 --> 00:22:10,500
Hell no. Can I get a chicken tendie combo, please?

135
00:22:23,579 --> 00:22:30,839
Okay, all right, all right, all right. Again? Does that count? That shouldn't count twice.

136
00:22:33,819 --> 00:22:39,160
No, no, it doesn't count twice. We were paused. What the fuck? It counts? Should it actually count,

137
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:49,670
though? Oh, move the camera. Where should I move it? Either 200 or fine. Now it counts. All right.

138
00:22:49,670 --> 00:23:01,130
Yeah, I can't. I'm usually, here's the thing, like, I'm usually pretty immune to most kind of like

139
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:09,529
memes, but sometimes they get me. I, sometimes they work. We're getting a lot of community subs.

140
00:23:12,069 --> 00:23:17,779
Okay, here we go. Back to it. Holy fuck. I'm so sorry.

141
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:27,480
That's me. I was laughing at that. That was fucking disgusting. That doesn't count if I laugh at my

142
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:43,029
own stupid bullshit. No, I didn't laugh at this. That doesn't count, right? Did you guys hear that?

143
00:23:43,029 --> 00:23:48,329
That was an audible disgusting burp and I did like the old man thing. All right,

144
00:23:48,329 --> 00:23:55,690
stop. Stop making me fucking laugh. I'm not looking at chat anymore. You didn't hear it?

145
00:23:55,690 --> 00:23:59,130
Okay, thank God. It was, thank God my noise gate didn't pick it up. All right.

146
00:24:13,579 --> 00:24:22,700
It doesn't count. You're going to cheapen the real ones. Yeah. All right. So stays at 300.

147
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:30,630
I thought this was going to be really easy. Like the first 10 or 15 videos were just like,

148
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:39,380
ah, these are humors. You suck at this. This is why I don't do these. I'm such a fucking like,

149
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:44,019
I'm one of the weasels from Who Framed Roger Rabbit. Guys, I laugh when like my car gets

150
00:24:44,019 --> 00:24:55,430
bumped in GTA. Do you think I'm going to laugh? It's going to be like fucking 50 grand. All right,

151
00:24:55,430 --> 00:25:05,690
I'll add it. No more. I guarantee it for at least the next 10 videos. Guaranteed. One, two, three.

152
00:25:13,859 --> 00:25:16,259
That was just, they just put a bunch of weird shit in the video.

153
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:30,740
Necromancy may be legal in Cyrodiil, but few will openly admit to practicing it now that

154
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:49,430
the Major's Guild has banned it. Farewell. Classic. Rest in peace. Forgot about that part.

155
00:25:50,069 --> 00:25:53,910
Richie. What? I might be stuck in the bathroom. I don't care.

156
00:25:57,589 --> 00:26:11,109
That was small. Yeah. Can I get a sausage and mushroom pizza? Hey, how you doing? Can I get a

157
00:26:11,109 --> 00:26:18,549
sausage and mushroom pizza? How you doing? Can I get a sausage and mushroom pizza? How you doing?

158
00:26:18,549 --> 00:26:34,740
Oh, my head.

159
00:26:55,829 --> 00:27:15,609
I love this. Ship my pants. Right here. Ship my pants. You're kidding. You can ship your pants

160
00:27:15,609 --> 00:27:20,890
right here. You hear that? I can ship my pants for free. Wow. I just may ship my pants. Yeah,

161
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:25,289
ship your pants. Billy, you can ship your pants too. I can't wait to ship my pants, dad. I just

162
00:27:25,289 --> 00:27:31,690
ship my pants. It's legal. It's very convenient. Very convenient. I just ship my drawers. I just

163
00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:36,329
ship my nighties. She's saying shit. I just shipped my pants. They're actually saying shit. If you can't

164
00:27:36,329 --> 00:27:40,970
find what you're looking for in store, we'll find it at kmart.com right now and ship it to you for

165
00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:50,730
free. What is it, citizen? If you've got to travel, by the nine divines, stay on the roads. It's the

166
00:27:50,730 --> 00:28:00,900
digra, you see. By the nine divines. Assault. Assault. You elves are all the same. All flash

167
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:07,670
and no fear. Let me tell you, I gotta pause it. I tell you right now, all the Skyrim and Oblivion

168
00:28:07,670 --> 00:28:13,099
memes don't do anything to me. Zero. Because I've only played those games with like Kermit the Frog

169
00:28:13,099 --> 00:28:18,619
fucking mods and like Thomas the Tank Engine engine and shit and like huge monsters and stuff. It does

170
00:28:18,619 --> 00:28:25,319
nothing to me. Because that by comparison is like nothing to like Kermit the Frog chasing you with

171
00:28:25,319 --> 00:28:41,450
a fucking battle axe. I've never played those games normally. Ever. Oh. I found some wild blizzies.

172
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:56,470
Hi, my name is Carla Shaw. You can stop at five or six stores or just one. I don't need friends.

173
00:28:56,470 --> 00:29:05,750
They disappoint me. Hi, I'm Todd Le Roux. You could stop at five or six stores or just one.

174
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:09,750
I feel like a deer in the headlights of love. I feel like I probably have a video like this.

175
00:29:10,549 --> 00:29:18,970
Like I've like auditioned for things before. You could stop at five or six stores or just

176
00:29:18,970 --> 00:29:26,650
one. You could stop at five or six stores or just one. I would kill it, by the way. Can I ask you

177
00:29:26,650 --> 00:29:42,539
kind of a weird question? You could stop at five or six stores or just one. I am the queen of the

178
00:29:42,539 --> 00:29:48,700
universe. The waves part. Cry it? And they engulf me and the water is warm. You think I'd do a better job?

179
00:29:51,299 --> 00:29:56,170
Or just one. I can see the Statue of Liberty from here.

180
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:12,680
You could stop at five or six stores. This fucking guy. I swear to God. The only reason why I laughed at that

181
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:18,200
is because like I just like seeing like weirdly into the future. I'm seeing like a thousand years

182
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:25,019
into the future or whatever. That's way too long. That's like gonna be me. Like the movements and shit.

183
00:30:28,170 --> 00:30:45,240
Reenact one. You're gonna undie. All right. You want me to try it? I have, okay. I can't stand up.

184
00:30:45,240 --> 00:31:01,029
I'll do it right here. I have to stand up. All right. Well, I got like shorts on. Just fucking

185
00:31:01,029 --> 00:31:05,589
relax. Hold on. I might, I gotta tie this. I have to like tie my little, I don't count.

186
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:24,259
I have like pajama shorts on. Okay. So it's, you could stop at five or six stores or just one

187
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:32,220
and then say like a weird Bible quote or something, right? Okay. Here we go. Turn off the room.

188
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:59,769
You could stop at, how do you do that? You could stop at five or, you could stop at five or six

189
00:31:59,769 --> 00:32:10,279
different stores. Just one. That's what gets you to fucking roll. They know you got emotion.

190
00:32:27,319 --> 00:32:39,380
I actually jumped. I'm so far away. I'm all the way back here. I went like, yeah. How loud was

191
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:46,519
that? Was that loud? It got me. It did. What did I do? You were coming for us. Was that really that

192
00:32:46,519 --> 00:32:54,470
bad? That actually made me jump. You charged at us. I don't know. It was that bad. I think it was okay.

193
00:32:55,190 --> 00:33:04,730
It was loud. It was loud. All right. All right. I'm not doing that ever again. Let's go.

194
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:20,900
You scared the shit out of me. I jumped. Oh, sorry. I scared you. Your, your jump was disjointed.

195
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:33,079
Let me see it. How was it really that loud? Hold on. Let me, let me, hold on. Let me watch it.

196
00:33:33,079 --> 00:33:57,559
I can't hear it. You could stop it. Oh, here we go. Okay. You see it? Right. Wait, that's freaking me

197
00:33:57,559 --> 00:34:39,300
out. You could stop at five or six different stores. Just one. Just one. Wild eyes. That's how

198
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:48,070
you scare the coyotes away. Yeah. That's like, there, there are like bears in your backyard.

199
00:34:49,699 --> 00:35:03,269
There are animals in your backyard and you're like, hey, hey. All right. Let's go.

200
00:35:03,269 --> 00:35:11,349
Just for just one. I can't stand it when she touches me. People say that time heals all wounds.

201
00:35:19,239 --> 00:35:24,869
I love this song. I'm going to say something to you right now that I've never said to an

202
00:35:24,869 --> 00:35:47,530
all loving soul in my life. No. Stand. Stand. And then there's Chunky. He's dead. That's my

203
00:35:47,530 --> 00:35:59,699
favorite video on YouTube. Chunky's dead. He's dead. I sneezed. Oh, I'm not allowed to sneeze.

204
00:36:00,659 --> 00:36:19,139
I love all these videos. Why are there so many captions?

205
00:36:22,969 --> 00:36:42,760
Why are captions turned on? It counts. I laughed at both of them in a row.

206
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:52,260
The only reason why I laughed at the second one was because the captions were on the screen.

207
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:59,429
What happened here? It was just so alarming. Is that Daffy?

208
00:37:01,349 --> 00:37:12,099
He's fucking dead. Like he's dead. That kills somebody. Look at his face. He's so fucked up.

209
00:37:12,099 --> 00:37:28,969
He has a gun. I don't know. Something about that is just, I don't understand the second one, but it

210
00:37:28,969 --> 00:37:37,380
was. Did you know we've come? You want to fight? Why? This is not going to make me laugh. I did it.

211
00:37:39,860 --> 00:38:10,630
Yes. All right, sir. Good one, sir. Good one. He's got the package.

212
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:41,369
Bomb, sir. The bomb. Defusing. Defuse. Bomb site secure. Bomb site secure.

213
00:38:41,929 --> 00:38:46,329
Ready for you to defuse the bomb. Bomb site secured. Bomb site under control.

214
00:38:46,329 --> 00:38:58,329
Where's the bomb? Where's the bomb? Where's this, sir? The time is running out.

215
00:39:48,329 --> 00:40:11,139
The title. What's this title, man? The title is Zoomer Humor. I can't help it. It's like I'm,

216
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:18,820
okay. Jeez. It's just, it's too much going on. Zoomer humor. I don't know. You know what it is?

217
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:24,599
It's the fact that there are just so many sound effects. And so it's so fast. Like that, like,

218
00:40:24,599 --> 00:40:28,760
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. It's just like your brain doesn't know what else

219
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:34,090
to do besides laugh because there's no other emotion that makes any sense at all. Nothing else

220
00:40:34,090 --> 00:40:47,980
makes sense. It's just like all the different images. Okay, I feel like when you close your

221
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:51,829
eyes, right, when you're going to sleep, let me know if anybody else has this happen to them.

222
00:40:51,829 --> 00:40:56,630
When you close your eyes and you're sleeping and you're just about to hit that place where you're,

223
00:40:56,630 --> 00:41:04,489
all right, I've gone unconscious and I'm falling asleep. There's this moment where your mind just

224
00:41:04,489 --> 00:41:12,250
kind of goes wherever it just races. You'll go to random places. You'll be sitting at a restaurant

225
00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:17,210
opposite side like Obama, just sitting there and having a conversation. All of a sudden you'll

226
00:41:17,210 --> 00:41:21,610
feel or hear like the wind will blow. The door will open and there is snow outside and I'm going

227
00:41:21,610 --> 00:41:26,380
to go outside. There's snow out there. There's a hamster in the snow. Our minds do this weird

228
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:32,920
thing right before falling asleep. That's what this is. And having, and having it be in a conscious

229
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:40,730
state and seeing it rather than kind of feeling it while you're sleeping is just, I can't do it.

230
00:41:40,730 --> 00:41:56,409
It's too much. Okay, so that was by far the biggest one for sure. I can't imagine if this is on hard

231
00:41:56,409 --> 00:42:13,929
mode. All right, let me update this. The fact that like somebody made this like specifically

232
00:42:13,929 --> 00:42:21,420
and they titled it this weird title. All right, you have to go back and do it again.

233
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:32,760
Where are we? Okay, here. I'm going to lose, I think it's going to, I'm going to fuck it up again.

234
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:43,179
Yeah, it's just surreal. It's just so, everything is so odd. Okay, I'm fine.

235
00:43:07,769 --> 00:43:18,010
Okay, I got through it. That was cute. That was really cute. That wasn't even funny. It was cute.

236
00:43:34,519 --> 00:43:36,199
See, you motherfuckers are going to think this is funny.

237
00:43:39,099 --> 00:43:41,579
You may got the honey, but I got the sugar.

238
00:43:45,579 --> 00:43:47,500
Croissant.

239
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:52,920
Beans.

240
00:43:56,920 --> 00:44:01,719
Let's see. Cream and mushrooms. Bro, she might have made beans, but you forgot about the

241
00:44:02,599 --> 00:44:11,619
macaroni and cheese. What do you want? Creamy Italian cheddar cheese.

242
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:16,019
Well, you may have the cheddar cheese, but I've got

243
00:44:31,289 --> 00:45:20,380
Oh, so it's just scary. What are you eating? I miss my wife tails. I miss her a lot. I'll be back.

244
00:45:23,019 --> 00:45:46,139
I was doing this. Oh, it's on 720p. This is adorable. This is so cute. I just like this

245
00:45:46,139 --> 00:46:02,460
little hamster. Hey, does anybody want coffee? Who wants coffee? I've seen this guy. Anybody

246
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:12,219
want coffee? Who wants coffee? Do you want coffee? I just made coffee. Do

247
00:46:12,219 --> 00:46:19,739
anybody want coffee? Who want coffee? I just make coffee. Who wants coffee?

248
00:46:19,739 --> 00:46:21,739
Anybody want coffee?

249
00:46:21,739 --> 00:46:23,739
Who wants coffee?

250
00:46:23,739 --> 00:46:25,739
Does anybody want coffee?

251
00:46:25,739 --> 00:46:27,739
Does anybody want coffee?

252
00:46:27,739 --> 00:46:29,739
Who wants coffee?

253
00:46:29,739 --> 00:46:31,739
Does anybody want coffee?

254
00:46:31,739 --> 00:46:33,739
Do you want coffee?

255
00:46:33,739 --> 00:46:35,739
Who wants coffee?

256
00:46:35,739 --> 00:46:42,579
Does anybody want coffee?

257
00:46:42,579 --> 00:46:59,530
Is it that bad?

258
00:46:59,530 --> 00:47:08,489
Oh, that was close.

259
00:47:08,489 --> 00:47:10,489
Howdy, y'all. This here's Mike.

260
00:47:10,489 --> 00:47:13,429
Down at Mike's Golf.

261
00:47:13,429 --> 00:47:19,000
Ugh.

262
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,500
It was just the transition between these two.

263
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:24,440
It was the howdy.

264
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:32,630
It just goes from XQC

265
00:47:32,630 --> 00:47:34,630
blowing out his microphone

266
00:47:34,630 --> 00:47:36,630
to howdy. I don't know.

267
00:47:36,630 --> 00:47:38,630
It was like the transition here.

268
00:47:38,630 --> 00:47:51,860
Whatever.

269
00:47:51,860 --> 00:47:56,019
Howdy, y'all. This here's Mike. Down at Mike's Golf.

270
00:47:56,019 --> 00:47:58,019
Are the capsules supposed to be on?

271
00:47:58,019 --> 00:48:00,579
Where we buy golf. That's right.

272
00:48:00,579 --> 00:48:02,579
We buy golf clubs.

273
00:48:02,579 --> 00:48:04,579
Mike's Golf Shop.

274
00:48:04,579 --> 00:48:07,340

Over at Mike's Golf Shop.

277
00:48:12,469 --> 00:48:14,469
Come on down here. We buy golf

278
00:48:14,469 --> 00:48:16,469
clubs. That's right.

We buy golf clubs.

280
00:48:18,469 --> 00:48:20,469
We buy golf clubs.

281
00:48:20,469 --> 00:48:22,469
We buy golf

282
00:48:22,469 --> 00:48:24,469
clubs. We buy

283
00:48:24,469 --> 00:48:26,469
golf clubs.

284
00:48:26,469 --> 00:48:28,469
We buy golf clubs.

285
00:48:28,469 --> 00:48:30,969
That muffin is looking awfully

286
00:48:30,969 --> 00:48:32,969
like a hamster. Someone

287
00:48:32,969 --> 00:48:34,969
baked a hamster into my

288
00:48:34,969 --> 00:48:45,639
muffin. What is that?

289
00:48:45,639 --> 00:48:50,440
He's not going to turn and eat the frog, right?

290
00:48:50,440 --> 00:49:26,260
Oh! Oh!

291
00:49:26,260 --> 00:49:40,980
I'm safe on this one, I think.

292
00:49:40,980 --> 00:49:45,530
I like these movements, though.

293
00:49:45,530 --> 00:50:03,130
It's loud. It's very loud.

294
00:50:03,130 --> 00:50:08,250
That was just scary.

295
00:50:08,250 --> 00:50:14,760
That was scary.

296
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:16,760
Freezing my nuts off.

297
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:18,760
Freezing my nuts off.

298
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:20,760
Freezing my nuts off.

299
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:22,760
Freezing my nuts off.

300
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:24,760
Perfect. Thank you.

301
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:26,760
Brahma. Freezing my nuts off.

302
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:28,760
That's just cute.

303
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:34,760
No, not this one.

304
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:46,760
Not this one.

305
00:51:15,699 --> 00:51:17,699
I forgot about this video.

306
00:51:17,699 --> 00:51:20,579
I forgot about this video.

307
00:51:20,579 --> 00:51:22,579
I forgot about this video.

308
00:51:22,579 --> 00:51:24,579
I forgot about this video.

309
00:51:24,579 --> 00:51:30,789
I forgot about this video.

310
00:51:30,789 --> 00:51:32,789
Why would they do that?

311
00:51:32,789 --> 00:51:36,500
Aren't bits of sweaty? What are you talking about?

312
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:38,679
You're laughing.

313
00:51:38,679 --> 00:51:40,679
It's fucking crazy.

314
00:51:40,679 --> 00:51:42,679
It's just so stupid.

315
00:51:42,679 --> 00:51:47,929
It's the fact that

316
00:51:47,929 --> 00:51:49,929
Oh, look, I'm sitting there, funny picture of me

317
00:51:49,929 --> 00:51:51,929
with a cap on or whatever, and it's

318
00:51:51,929 --> 00:51:56,469
just like this car.

319
00:51:56,469 --> 00:51:59,800
Alright, whatever.

320
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:01,800
I haven't seen this video in a long time.

321
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:03,800
That's how I knew I was fucking screwed.

322
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:07,820
It's always...

323
00:52:07,820 --> 00:52:13,449
Okay, I have to start it over.

324
00:52:13,449 --> 00:52:18,500
We got a thousand bucks in the pool right now.

325
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:21,130
It's just this

326
00:52:21,130 --> 00:52:23,130
photo...

327
00:52:23,130 --> 00:52:25,130
Whatever. You know, I don't have to say it again.

328
00:52:25,130 --> 00:52:27,130
I fail. Let's go.

329
00:52:27,130 --> 00:52:29,369
I'm gonna get

330
00:52:29,369 --> 00:52:31,369
fucking locked here.

331
00:52:38,170 --> 00:52:40,170
I have to get over it.

332
00:52:40,170 --> 00:52:42,170
It's the... You've done a lot together.

333
00:52:42,170 --> 00:52:44,170
It's just... I can't...

334
00:52:44,170 --> 00:52:46,170
It's... Fuck.

335
00:52:46,170 --> 00:52:48,170
This is bad.

336
00:52:48,170 --> 00:52:50,170
Once I get stuck, I get stuck for a while.

337
00:52:50,170 --> 00:52:59,190
Okay. You're insane.

338
00:52:59,190 --> 00:53:01,190
You're gonna get stun locked here.

339
00:53:01,190 --> 00:53:03,190
I'm gonna try... Okay.

340
00:53:03,190 --> 00:53:10,039
Why are you laughing? It's fucking crazy.

341
00:53:10,039 --> 00:53:12,280
I'm gonna try...

342
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:21,179
I'm gonna try...

343
00:53:21,179 --> 00:53:24,570
I'm gonna try...

344
00:53:24,570 --> 00:53:26,570
I'm gonna try...

345
00:53:26,570 --> 00:53:28,570
Why are you laughing? It's fucking crazy.

346
00:53:28,570 --> 00:53:30,570
It's so stupid.

347
00:54:01,369 --> 00:54:06,360
No!

348
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:09,300
If any of the videos...

349
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:11,670
I have to... I need to take a minute.

350
00:54:11,670 --> 00:54:18,010
I can't... You can't skip it.

351
00:54:18,010 --> 00:54:24,090
That's not how this works.

352
00:54:24,090 --> 00:54:26,090
We're at $1,200 now.

353
00:54:26,090 --> 00:54:28,090
I'm gonna get through this one. I'm gonna get through it.

354
00:54:28,090 --> 00:54:30,090
I just have to hide. Everybody relax.

355
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:40,920
It's the music, too.

356
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:42,920
The music is so... And this photo in the very beginning.

357
00:55:11,900 --> 00:55:13,900
No!

358
00:55:13,900 --> 00:55:15,900
I can't. I'm sorry.

359
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:17,900
Okay. Skip it for $500?

360
00:55:17,900 --> 00:55:19,900
No. I can get it.

361
00:55:19,900 --> 00:55:22,139
I swear to God, I can get it.

362
00:55:22,139 --> 00:55:27,559
It's a... Oh, remember this?

363
00:55:27,559 --> 00:55:40,860
Like, we just remembered it.

364
00:55:40,860 --> 00:55:42,860
You don't make us remember this again. It's horrible.

365
00:55:42,860 --> 00:55:47,530
I don't want to remember this. I don't even want to think of this again.

366
00:55:47,530 --> 00:55:49,530
Alright. Last try.

367
00:55:49,530 --> 00:55:51,530
And then I'm skipping it for $100.

368
00:55:51,530 --> 00:55:53,530
Okay.

369
00:55:53,530 --> 00:55:55,530
Okay.

370
00:55:55,530 --> 00:55:58,469
Okay.

371
00:55:58,469 --> 00:56:02,500
Try. And then I'm skipping it for $100.

372
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:04,500
I'm gonna get through it this time. I have to have seen it enough time.

373
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:09,179
God damn it.

374
00:56:09,179 --> 00:56:13,530
I remember this video, too.

375
00:56:13,530 --> 00:56:16,980
And I have just spent so long.

376
00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:19,670
Okay. This is it. This is the one.

377
00:56:19,670 --> 00:56:22,869
Thank you for watching!

378
00:56:55,829 --> 00:56:57,829
Thank you for watching!

Thank you for watching!

390
00:57:24,179 --> 00:57:26,179
Thank you for watching!

391
00:57:27,179 --> 00:57:29,179
Get it off! Turn it off! Turn it off! I've done it too many times.

392
00:57:29,179 --> 00:57:32,639
Oh my god, my head hurts.

393
00:57:32,639 --> 00:57:35,010
I'm good. Uh, let's do Ocarina of Time.

394
00:57:35,010 --> 00:57:37,869
Ocarina of Time.

395
00:57:38,869 --> 00:57:45,449
Hello. Two tickets, please.

396
00:57:45,449 --> 00:57:47,449
For what? Moving.

397
00:57:47,449 --> 00:57:50,710
Hey, Tony, what's going on?

398
00:57:50,710 --> 00:57:53,849
Tony, what the fuck is this?

399
00:57:53,849 --> 00:57:56,150
What the fuck? Tony!

400
00:57:56,150 --> 00:57:58,150
Tony, what the fuck is this, Tony?

401
00:57:58,150 --> 00:58:00,150
Tony, I did what I thought was best for the family, motherfucker!

402
00:58:00,150 --> 00:58:02,150
You gotta believe me, Tony!

403
00:58:02,150 --> 00:58:04,150
Please don't shoot the fucking gun, Tony!

404
00:58:04,150 --> 00:58:06,150
Oh my god!

405
00:58:06,150 --> 00:58:08,150
This is cute.

406
00:58:35,750 --> 00:58:37,750
Not even real.

407
00:58:37,750 --> 00:58:40,570
This one's a piece of cake.

408
00:58:40,570 --> 00:58:44,409
Not even real.

409
00:58:44,409 --> 00:58:57,059
You motherfuckers.

410
00:58:57,059 --> 00:58:59,059
Turn camera!

411
00:58:59,059 --> 00:59:01,820
102, take one.

412
00:59:01,820 --> 00:59:07,960
With overlap. Action, please.

413
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:09,960
I'm gonna get locked on this one too.

414
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:12,460
Action, awesome, please.

415
00:59:12,460 --> 00:59:14,460
It doesn't do anything?

416
00:59:14,460 --> 00:59:17,079
No, sorry, cut.

417
00:59:17,079 --> 00:59:20,090
102, take two.

418
00:59:20,090 --> 00:59:26,090
Ah, the French Champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.

419
00:59:26,090 --> 00:59:30,090
There is a California Champagne by Paul Masson.

420
00:59:30,090 --> 00:59:32,090
So drunk.

421
00:59:32,090 --> 00:59:36,090
Inspired by that same French excellence.

422
00:59:36,090 --> 00:59:40,090
It's fermented in the bottle and like the best French Champagne.

423
00:59:40,090 --> 00:59:42,090
It's vintage dated.

424
00:59:42,090 --> 00:59:44,090
Cut.

425
00:59:44,090 --> 00:59:46,090
So Paul Masson.

426
00:59:46,090 --> 00:59:48,090
102, take three.

427
00:59:48,090 --> 00:59:50,090
I think I'm gonna be alright.

428
00:59:50,090 --> 00:59:52,090
Action, please.

429
00:59:52,090 --> 00:59:56,090
Champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.

430
00:59:56,090 --> 01:00:00,090
There is a California Champagne by Paul Masson.

431
01:00:00,090 --> 01:00:04,519
Inspired by that same French excellence.

432
01:00:04,519 --> 01:00:08,519
It's fermented in the bottle and like the best French Champagne.

433
01:00:08,519 --> 01:00:10,519
It's vintage dated.

434
01:00:10,519 --> 01:00:12,519
So Paul Masson.

435
01:00:12,519 --> 01:00:14,519
Alright, we're good.

436
01:00:14,519 --> 01:00:16,519
We're good, we're good, we're good.

437
01:00:16,519 --> 01:00:20,519
Orson Welles right there is as drunk as you are.

438
01:00:20,519 --> 01:00:22,519
As you are.

439
01:00:22,519 --> 01:00:26,519
When you get to that point where you have to put your phone up like this.

440
01:00:26,519 --> 01:00:33,130
And hold one eye open to like see if the lift driver is there.

441
01:00:33,130 --> 01:00:39,659
Not fun.

442
01:00:39,659 --> 01:00:41,659
I love this video.

443
01:00:41,659 --> 01:00:44,090
I'm not even gonna laugh at this.

444
01:00:44,090 --> 01:00:48,179
This video is just a good video.

445
01:00:48,179 --> 01:00:50,809
Let me move some of this stuff out of the way.

446
01:00:50,809 --> 01:01:02,360
This is a great video.

447
01:01:02,360 --> 01:01:04,599
I don't think I'm gonna laugh.

448
01:01:04,599 --> 01:01:07,670
La la la la la.

449
01:01:07,670 --> 01:01:09,670
La la la la la.

450
01:01:09,670 --> 01:01:11,670
La la la la la.

451
01:01:11,670 --> 01:01:13,670
La la.

452
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:16,409
La la la.

453
01:01:16,409 --> 01:01:18,840
La la la la.

454
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:21,659
La la la.

455
01:01:21,659 --> 01:01:24,920
La la.

456
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:26,920
It's so weird.

457
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:28,920
La la.

458
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:31,159
La la.

459
01:01:31,159 --> 01:01:33,159
Alright, I'm gonna freak people out.

460
01:01:33,159 --> 01:01:35,159
La la la la la.

461
01:01:35,159 --> 01:01:37,159
La la la la la.

462
01:01:37,159 --> 01:01:39,159
La la.

463
01:01:39,159 --> 01:01:41,159
La la.

464
01:01:41,159 --> 01:01:43,159
Trump dog?

465
01:01:43,159 --> 01:01:45,159
La la la la la.

466
01:01:45,159 --> 01:01:47,159
I played this on stream already.

467
01:01:47,159 --> 01:01:49,530
La la la la la.

468
01:01:49,530 --> 01:01:51,769
La la.

469
01:01:51,769 --> 01:01:54,070
If that was you on the phone and you on the bus.

470
01:01:54,070 --> 01:01:58,309
Then who was flickering the lights?

471
01:01:58,309 --> 01:02:02,730
It's me Austin!

472
01:02:02,730 --> 01:02:04,730
Oh son of a bitch!

473
01:02:04,730 --> 01:02:12,659
You already got me with that one.

474
01:02:12,659 --> 01:02:55,099
Oh god!

475
01:02:55,099 --> 01:02:58,739
Why did you come by train today?

476
01:03:01,369 --> 01:03:03,610
Very excited about my new fridge.

477
01:03:03,610 --> 01:03:07,000
Look.

478
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
Wait, wait, wait.

479
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:13,099
Where's the water?

480
01:03:13,099 --> 01:03:17,000
That just sucks. What happened?

481
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:21,610
Fuck.

482
01:03:21,610 --> 01:03:25,960
I'm staying up extra late tonight

483
01:03:25,960 --> 01:03:27,960
to see a test train pull into Brighton station.

484
01:03:27,960 --> 01:03:29,960
One of my favorite locomotives

485
01:03:29,960 --> 01:03:31,960
might be on it so we'll just have to wait and see.

486
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:35,960
There's 73962!

487
01:03:35,960 --> 01:03:37,960
Oh it's it!

488
01:03:37,960 --> 01:03:39,960
It's it!

489
01:03:39,960 --> 01:03:43,030
Oh quick, I've got to get around.

490
01:03:43,030 --> 01:03:45,030
I've got to get around to see it.

491
01:03:47,030 --> 01:03:49,030
This is beautiful 73962.

492
01:03:49,030 --> 01:03:51,030
Dick my butt.

493
01:03:51,030 --> 01:03:53,030
What?

494
01:03:53,030 --> 01:03:55,030
What a beautiful locomotive she is.

495
01:03:55,030 --> 01:03:57,030
Check out all the gear in there.

496
01:03:57,030 --> 01:03:59,030
That's not real!

497
01:03:59,030 --> 01:04:01,980
Marvelous loco.

498
01:04:01,980 --> 01:04:03,980
I'm glad I stayed up late for this.

499
01:04:03,980 --> 01:04:05,980
This is a treat.

500
01:04:09,880 --> 01:04:11,880
That's a real train?

501
01:04:33,940 --> 01:04:35,940
In the beaning.

502
01:04:35,940 --> 01:04:39,000
In the in

503
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
the beaming.

504
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,750
Yeah.

505
01:04:48,170 --> 01:04:50,170
Listen properly.

506
01:04:50,170 --> 01:04:52,170
In the beaming.

507
01:04:52,170 --> 01:04:54,170
Yeah.

508
01:04:54,170 --> 01:04:56,599
In the beaming.

509
01:04:56,599 --> 01:04:58,969
The beaming.

510
01:04:58,969 --> 01:05:01,460
I n.

511
01:05:01,460 --> 01:05:07,199
In- in the be- in the beeninging. In the beeninging.

512
01:05:07,199 --> 01:05:10,519
Three, two, one.

513
01:05:10,519 --> 01:05:15,650
Fast, sharp right. Fast, sharp right. Sharp right.

514
01:05:15,650 --> 01:05:49,429
Sammy, fall, Sammy, please. Medium left, watching out the-

515
01:05:49,429 --> 01:05:53,780
Sammy, you have to stay on the road, Sammy. Otherwise-

516
01:05:53,780 --> 01:06:05,920
Sammy, you're gonna break the car.

517
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:10,670
Can you just imagine, like, somebody sitting behind Donkey Kong just yelling all this shit to him?

518
01:06:10,670 --> 01:06:20,269
Ugh. You need to stay- when they go up and they do the gliding-

519
01:06:20,269 --> 01:06:22,269
Holy shit, I'm sweating my ass off!

520
01:06:23,030 --> 01:06:26,530
Ugh. It's always cars, I know!

521
01:06:26,530 --> 01:06:33,710
Something about vehicles, just cars, I don't know why, they're just so-

522
01:06:33,710 --> 01:06:39,130
Something about it just does it to me. I don't get it.

523
01:06:39,130 --> 01:06:47,059
1400. It's alright. I don't- it's just like the way he's turning and it-

524
01:06:47,059 --> 01:06:52,969
The car's bump- you don't even go- that doesn't even happen to you in Mario Kart.

525
01:06:52,969 --> 01:06:56,210
Okay. You're admitting it. I'm just finding out what I think is-

526
01:06:56,210 --> 01:07:00,769
Is it just big, bulky machines that we just drive around?

527
01:07:00,769 --> 01:07:04,650
It's so weird that we do this in the first place.

528
01:07:04,650 --> 01:07:07,650
Don't you guys think it's just bizarre that we drive around in cars anyways?

529
01:07:07,650 --> 01:07:09,820
Like, it's such a weird object.

530
01:07:09,820 --> 01:07:13,820
We have this machine that we all just sit in and it just goes fast.

531
01:07:13,820 --> 01:07:21,420
It's just like a- what a fucking weird device.

532
01:07:21,420 --> 01:07:25,059
Okay. Let's update it.

533
01:07:25,059 --> 01:07:27,429
And- alright, I'm gonna try this one again.

534
01:07:27,429 --> 01:07:35,389
He's got the notepad to- ugh.

535
01:07:35,389 --> 01:07:38,269
I'm gonna try this one more time. I think I can get through it.

536
01:07:38,269 --> 01:07:42,269
It was just this part here when he's yelling at him to stay on the road because they're flying.

537
01:07:42,269 --> 01:07:49,469
Here we go! Do hard mode? Maybe. Let's go.

538
01:07:50,469 --> 01:07:54,360
You didn't laugh at the train.

539
01:07:54,360 --> 01:07:56,360
That was more unusual to me than funny.

540
01:07:56,360 --> 01:07:58,820
Go.

541
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:33,600
Shut up, too.

542
01:09:01,489 --> 01:09:06,250
I'm good. I'm good. That was rough.

543
01:09:11,840 --> 01:09:15,840
What do you mean? They're for everybody but only for you?

544
01:09:15,840 --> 01:09:17,840
Granny, they're dog treats.

545
01:09:17,840 --> 01:09:19,840
No! No!

546
01:09:19,840 --> 01:09:23,039
Oh, that was close. Just her- they only-

547
01:09:23,039 --> 01:09:26,039
Squish that cat. All you need to know is to squish that cat.

548
01:09:26,039 --> 01:09:28,039
And you just gently squish them.

549
01:09:28,039 --> 01:09:31,039
That's not comfortable for the cat or that's safe to be honest with you.

550
01:09:31,039 --> 01:09:34,039
You can just throw a towel on the cat again, squish her with a towel.

551
01:09:34,039 --> 01:09:37,039
What you can do is scoop her up, a little football carry, just like that.

552
01:09:37,039 --> 01:09:39,039
Butt in your hand and just squish her tight to your body.

553
01:09:39,039 --> 01:09:41,039
Just squish him really tight to your body.

554
01:09:41,039 --> 01:09:43,039
You don't have to worry about hurting a cat.

555
01:09:43,039 --> 01:09:45,039
Just squish him against your body.

556
01:09:45,039 --> 01:09:47,039
And there we go. We just made friends with this wonderful little cat.

557
01:09:47,039 --> 01:09:49,039
Look at that face.

558
01:09:49,039 --> 01:09:51,039
Squishing is your best friend when you're dealing with a cat.

559
01:09:51,039 --> 01:09:54,039
You basically just lean forward, squish him nice and tight.

560
01:09:54,039 --> 01:09:56,039
And again, I'm just squishing them into myself.

561
01:09:56,039 --> 01:09:58,039
We always squish that cat.

562
01:09:58,039 --> 01:10:01,600
I'm just confused by that one. Squish?

563
01:10:07,020 --> 01:11:04,409
Why do I feel like this is an edited video from like four different scenes of this movie but it's not?

564
01:11:07,409 --> 01:11:32,859
The end. The scream at the end.

565
01:11:32,859 --> 01:11:38,060
I've seen so many of those breathing videos but it doesn't matter.

566
01:11:38,060 --> 01:11:44,899
I think I just missed one.

567
01:11:44,899 --> 01:11:56,220
How much longer? I don't know. I don't want to look.

568
01:11:56,220 --> 01:12:07,109
Macho Man Randy Savage had some classic breathing videos too.

569
01:12:07,109 --> 01:12:09,350
Alright, let me add it.

570
01:12:09,350 --> 01:12:13,909
I feel like I don't have to watch that one again because I got to the very end and I laughed after the video ended.

571
01:12:13,909 --> 01:12:19,420
30k viewers, what's up?

572
01:12:19,420 --> 01:12:23,590
Welcome to the stream. This is a You Laugh You Lose slash Baby Sensory stream.

573
01:12:23,590 --> 01:12:26,279
Uh, this is fun.

574
01:12:26,279 --> 01:12:30,489
What's going on? What's up everybody?

575
01:12:30,489 --> 01:12:32,489
Okay. I didn't laugh at this one. Let's start this one over.

576
01:12:32,489 --> 01:12:38,369
What is Baby Sensory? I might go hard mode for that one. We'll find out.

577
01:12:38,369 --> 01:12:43,529
Please cut the ringing. It sounds kind of like a...

578
01:12:51,550 --> 01:12:54,550
I know what I have to do but I don't know if I have the strength to do it.

579
01:12:57,689 --> 01:13:02,260
Jesus!

580
01:13:02,260 --> 01:13:07,260
Even the babies are one of the most dangerous animals in the world so I built this cage to keep them secure so there's no possible...

581
01:13:07,260 --> 01:13:09,260
Oh my god.

582
01:13:15,939 --> 01:13:27,079
You know what I'm saying? If I miss this joke, I'm low key. If I miss this joke, I'm gay as hell. I'm gay as hell if I miss this joke.

583
01:13:28,079 --> 01:13:30,079
Yo, Baba, how's the food tasting?

584
01:13:34,710 --> 01:13:36,710
Yo, Baba, how's the food tasting?

585
01:13:36,710 --> 01:13:42,710
Oh, this stuff is buzzing. Respectfully. No kidding.

586
01:13:42,710 --> 01:13:44,710
Oh, what about you Abuji?

587
01:14:01,939 --> 01:14:06,939
I knew he was going to say it too. That's the worst part. He just screamed it.

588
01:14:06,939 --> 01:14:09,939
Whatever. I have Zoom or humor. I don't care.

589
01:14:09,939 --> 01:14:11,939
I don't give a shit. Whatever.

590
01:14:11,939 --> 01:14:15,390
Make a well-crafted joke.

591
01:14:15,390 --> 01:14:20,390
No, I don't think it's funny. I don't care. You give a whole story of something funny that happened.

592
01:14:20,390 --> 01:14:23,390
Get an old guy to say sheesh on camera and I'm gone.

593
01:14:23,390 --> 01:14:29,810
It's just the first part. The first part of the Zoom or humor is funny.

594
01:14:29,810 --> 01:14:36,250
I think they're quick. That's something I think Zoomers don't get a lot of credit for. Zoomers are quick.

595
01:14:36,250 --> 01:14:41,130
Now, a lot of Zoom or humor I think falls. It just goes right off my head.

596
01:14:41,130 --> 01:14:44,430
But man, they're quick. They're quick.

597
01:14:44,430 --> 01:14:46,380
They're quick.

598
01:14:46,380 --> 01:14:53,380
The best part about Zoom or humor is because it's so quick, even if it sucks, it's over in three seconds.

599
01:14:53,380 --> 01:15:03,539
If I don't like a boomer or like older person's joke or something, I might have to sit there for four minutes while they tell me.

600
01:15:03,539 --> 01:15:05,539
Shit's over in two seconds if you're a Zoomer.

601
01:15:05,539 --> 01:15:10,149
Alright, I just want to see it again because I like it.

602
01:15:10,149 --> 01:15:13,149
We're getting so many subs too. This is ridiculous. Thanks everybody.

603
01:15:13,149 --> 01:15:16,149
25 from you.

604
01:15:16,149 --> 01:15:19,329
Well, OK, I think it's time to do a hard one.

605
01:15:19,329 --> 01:15:22,329
Unionize your workplace. Thanks for 25 community subs.

606
01:15:22,329 --> 01:15:25,699
And then we had 10 from David Shower. Thank you.

607
01:15:25,699 --> 01:15:28,939
OK, I just want to see it again.

608
01:15:28,939 --> 01:15:30,939
Oh, Baba, how's the food tasting?

609
01:15:30,939 --> 01:15:33,939
Oh, this stuff is buzzing.

610
01:15:33,939 --> 01:15:35,939
You can tell he's waiting his turn to do the joke.

611
01:15:35,939 --> 01:15:36,939
No.

612
01:15:36,939 --> 01:15:37,939
It gets me too.

613
01:15:37,939 --> 01:15:38,939
What about you, Abuji?

614
01:15:38,939 --> 01:15:41,779
Shit!

615
01:15:41,779 --> 01:16:04,890
Do you know why he's called Colonel Sanders?

616
01:16:04,890 --> 01:16:05,890
No, why?

617
01:16:05,890 --> 01:16:06,890
Because he is...

618
01:16:13,689 --> 01:16:16,590
Hello, America.

619
01:16:51,220 --> 01:16:52,220
What?

620
01:16:58,329 --> 01:16:59,329
Hi.

621
01:16:59,329 --> 01:17:01,329
The easy way to say

622
01:17:03,329 --> 01:17:04,329
is to say

623
01:17:07,569 --> 01:17:10,789
Hold the yogurt?

624
01:17:15,420 --> 01:17:29,180
Fuck.

625
01:17:31,180 --> 01:17:41,380
Fuck.

626
01:17:45,380 --> 01:17:47,380
This guy's fucking crazy.

627
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:53,500
Who is this guy? This guy's fucked up.

628
01:17:59,060 --> 01:18:02,060
Heart of Darkness is about a young boy named Andy.

629
01:18:02,060 --> 01:18:03,060
Skipping. I'm skipping it.

630
01:18:03,060 --> 01:18:05,060
I don't...

631
01:18:05,060 --> 01:18:06,060
We don't watch those videos.

632
01:18:06,060 --> 01:18:15,539
If we got to add 100, oh shit, I'll get it.

633
01:18:15,539 --> 01:18:21,170
An embarrassing video.

634
01:18:21,170 --> 01:18:23,560
Cheater?

635
01:18:23,560 --> 01:18:27,359
Well, I don't think I'm going to...

636
01:18:27,359 --> 01:18:29,359
All right, here we go. Listen to me.

637
01:18:29,359 --> 01:18:33,369
I don't think I'm going to laugh at my own streams, if I'm honest.

638
01:18:33,369 --> 01:18:35,989
Because, like, I was there.

639
01:18:35,989 --> 01:18:41,239
No rules, Andy.

640
01:18:41,239 --> 01:18:45,210
400 subs? What?

641
01:18:45,210 --> 01:18:46,579
Oh, you just made that up, Art.

642
01:18:46,579 --> 01:18:50,539
Well, it's because they're not funny.

643
01:18:50,539 --> 01:18:58,289
No, you can have that opinion.

644
01:18:58,289 --> 01:19:00,529
If you don't think I'm funny, then that's fine.

645
01:19:00,529 --> 01:19:01,529
I'm not going to tell you you're wrong.

646
01:19:01,529 --> 01:19:05,239
Be sad for a minute.

647
01:19:05,239 --> 01:19:08,670
And then curse you out when I'm in the shower.

648
01:19:30,590 --> 01:19:32,590
I like a height. I like a climb.

649
01:19:32,590 --> 01:19:34,590
But, like, she stepped on a church.

650
01:19:34,590 --> 01:19:37,279
I mean, a knee building, really.

651
01:19:37,279 --> 01:19:39,279
Because, legally, they're not supposed to be able to ask you about that

652
01:19:39,279 --> 01:19:42,279
on, like, your homeowners' association application.

653
01:19:42,279 --> 01:19:44,279
But they'll ask. They'll look it up.

654
01:19:44,279 --> 01:19:47,279
If she doesn't exist in the same physical timeline as I am...

655
01:19:47,279 --> 01:19:51,039
What's the poster in the back?

656
01:19:51,039 --> 01:19:52,039
I'm not doing that again.

657
01:19:52,039 --> 01:20:00,220
Is it Nightmare Before Christmas?

658
01:20:00,220 --> 01:20:10,050
Hi, this is Tommy Weasel, creator of The Room.

659
01:20:10,050 --> 01:20:14,050
Let me introduce you to the new Joker.

660
01:20:14,050 --> 01:20:18,659
Hi.

661
01:21:03,409 --> 01:21:05,409
Can we laugh, please?

662
01:21:09,060 --> 01:21:26,779
Dude, the only thing that's making me laugh is the fact that we dress...

663
01:21:26,779 --> 01:21:29,779
He's dressed in baby clothes, like, human baby clothes.

664
01:21:29,779 --> 01:21:32,960
It's just so... What are we doing?

665
01:21:32,960 --> 01:21:54,050
Don't talk about this.

666
01:21:54,050 --> 01:22:06,979
This edible ain't shit.

667
01:22:16,380 --> 01:22:18,380
Can you tell me where I'm on this?

668
01:22:18,380 --> 01:22:20,380
I'll add it. I'll add it. I almost laughed at the GTA one,

669
01:22:20,380 --> 01:22:23,380
not because it was a car, but because of something very specific.

670
01:22:23,380 --> 01:22:26,380
Hit F2 to save clip in the corner.

671
01:22:26,380 --> 01:22:29,380
You know that motherfucker was like...

672
01:22:29,380 --> 01:22:31,380
That's what they hit F2.

673
01:22:31,380 --> 01:22:42,060
I have to go back?

674
01:22:42,060 --> 01:22:44,060
I said I wouldn't laugh at myself.

675
01:22:44,060 --> 01:22:49,279
But that was just so fucking weird.

676
01:22:49,279 --> 01:22:51,279
It was so outrageously strong.

677
01:22:51,279 --> 01:22:54,159
All right. I'll get through it. I'll get through it.

678
01:22:54,159 --> 01:22:56,159
I'll get through it. I'll get through it.

679
01:22:56,159 --> 01:22:59,869
This edible ain't shit.

680
01:22:59,869 --> 01:23:01,869
I just look like a different person. Okay.

681
01:23:01,869 --> 01:23:09,529
Can you tell me where Armand Kristoff is hiding?

682
01:23:09,529 --> 01:23:11,529
He's not going to do shit.

683
01:23:11,529 --> 01:23:14,279
I'm in hiding from the Imperial watch.

684
01:23:14,279 --> 01:23:16,279
It's funny, but it's not Thomas the Tank Engine.

685
01:23:16,279 --> 01:23:18,279
I just punched him, sorry.

686
01:23:18,279 --> 01:23:22,949
No, dude. What are you doing?

687
01:23:28,609 --> 01:23:57,020
This is fucking gross!

688
01:23:57,020 --> 01:24:05,340
I'm not even going to laugh.

689
01:24:05,340 --> 01:24:07,340
What the... All right. I'm getting it off.

690
01:24:07,340 --> 01:24:09,340
Get it off. Get it off. Get it off. I don't want to listen to it anymore.

691
01:24:09,340 --> 01:24:11,340
I don't want to listen to it anymore.

692
01:24:11,340 --> 01:24:13,340
I don't want to listen to it anymore.

693
01:24:13,340 --> 01:24:30,239
I don't want to listen to it anymore. Get it off.

694
01:24:30,239 --> 01:24:32,989
Hey, hold on a second. I don't want to be late.

695
01:24:32,989 --> 01:24:35,869
Let me finish this.

696
01:24:35,869 --> 01:24:37,869
Fuck.

697
01:24:41,869 --> 01:25:00,109
Holy shit.

698
01:25:06,149 --> 01:25:08,149
That was insane.

699
01:25:12,500 --> 01:25:19,859
You're sick right there.

700
01:26:07,800 --> 01:26:12,789
Oh, my God.

701
01:26:12,789 --> 01:26:21,180
That was just cool.

702
01:26:21,180 --> 01:26:26,300
I love refrigerator.

703
01:26:30,539 --> 01:26:32,539
I've seen this one.

704
01:26:36,539 --> 01:26:38,539
It's classic.

705
01:26:40,539 --> 01:26:47,899
It's classic, but it's not going to get me.

706
01:26:56,140 --> 01:27:00,140
This is actually real. It can't be.

707
01:27:07,739 --> 01:27:10,109
It's real.

708
01:27:26,800 --> 01:27:28,800
It's uncanny, Lisa.

709
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:42,800
It's classic.

710
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:44,800
It's a real sketch.

711
01:27:54,800 --> 01:27:56,800
I'm trying to...

712
01:27:56,800 --> 01:27:58,800
Okay, I'm good. I'm safe.

713
01:27:58,800 --> 01:28:01,039
Oh, shit.

714
01:28:15,100 --> 01:28:18,039
We're going to go viral with this one.

715
01:28:24,600 --> 01:28:26,600
I've seen this video about two or three hundred times in the last six months.

716
01:28:26,600 --> 01:28:28,600
It's not going to get me, but it's my favorite.

717
01:28:28,600 --> 01:28:30,600
One of my favorite videos ever.

718
01:28:30,600 --> 01:28:32,600
I'm not going to reenact this. I'll die.

719
01:28:40,579 --> 01:28:42,579
That sock dog shooter.

720
01:28:42,579 --> 01:28:49,239
Slimer, it is.

721
01:28:49,239 --> 01:29:06,569
Do we already see this one?

722
01:29:06,569 --> 01:29:17,899
Oh, he just walked by.

723
01:29:17,899 --> 01:29:27,420
This is bromine.

724
01:29:27,420 --> 01:29:29,979
No, wait, sorry.

725
01:29:29,979 --> 01:29:32,979
That was soy sauce.

726
01:29:32,979 --> 01:29:34,979
This is bromine.

727
01:29:34,979 --> 01:29:38,250
Duke, do you want the ball?

728
01:30:00,939 --> 01:30:02,939
What is happening in this photo?

729
01:30:02,939 --> 01:30:06,199
I don't understand.

730
01:30:06,199 --> 01:30:10,869
What?

731
01:30:10,869 --> 01:30:17,979
What?

732
01:30:17,979 --> 01:30:19,979
He turned...

733
01:30:19,979 --> 01:30:22,220
Is it upside down?

734
01:30:22,220 --> 01:30:25,100
It's not a filter.

735
01:30:25,100 --> 01:30:27,100
I think he's upside down in this photo.

736
01:30:27,100 --> 01:30:32,279
Jesus.

737
01:30:32,279 --> 01:30:34,279
God damn it.

738
01:30:34,279 --> 01:30:37,539
That was stupid.

739
01:30:37,539 --> 01:30:39,539
RTX on.

740
01:30:39,539 --> 01:30:41,909
I think he's hanging upside down.

741
01:30:41,909 --> 01:30:43,909
He's upside down.

742
01:30:43,909 --> 01:30:47,750
Fucked up upside down photo.

743
01:30:47,750 --> 01:30:54,409
Is that 18? Did I do it twice?

744
01:30:54,409 --> 01:31:04,840
It's because he's flexing.

745
01:31:04,840 --> 01:31:07,529
That's 18. We'll go back.

746
01:31:07,529 --> 01:31:14,500
This one was crazy, too.

747
01:31:14,500 --> 01:31:29,659
I'm doing it one more time.

748
01:31:34,010 --> 01:31:36,010
Okay, I'm over.

749
01:31:38,010 --> 01:31:40,010
I've seen this a million times.

750
01:32:10,199 --> 01:32:12,199
Where's my lip balm?

751
01:32:28,649 --> 01:32:31,590
Oh, Jesus.

752
01:32:31,590 --> 01:32:46,380
What the hell is going on?

753
01:32:46,380 --> 01:33:05,689
Why is it two?

754
01:33:05,689 --> 01:33:07,689
It's two people.

755
01:33:07,689 --> 01:33:11,380
Oh, it's the dog.

756
01:33:11,380 --> 01:33:17,529
Okay, they swapped out the dog.

757
01:33:17,529 --> 01:33:19,699
That's so weird.

758
01:33:19,699 --> 01:33:26,739
He's not going to piss, is he?

759
01:33:26,739 --> 01:33:34,170
I think I'm okay.

760
01:33:34,170 --> 01:33:56,619
I think I'm all right.

761
01:33:56,619 --> 01:34:15,500
I think I'm going to be okay.

762
01:34:15,500 --> 01:34:18,380
Cute.

763
01:34:18,380 --> 01:34:20,380
Holy shit.

764
01:34:22,380 --> 01:34:37,800
That was...

765
01:34:46,550 --> 01:34:48,550
Could any human do that?

766
01:34:48,550 --> 01:34:51,939
If somebody practiced that enough,

767
01:34:51,939 --> 01:34:55,939
would it even be possible to do even the first part of that?

768
01:34:55,939 --> 01:34:58,819
It's a lucky thing I had my pieces.

769
01:34:58,819 --> 01:35:01,960
Your pieces?

770
01:35:01,960 --> 01:35:03,960
My guns.

771
01:35:03,960 --> 01:35:05,960
Anyway, I started blasting.

772
01:35:05,960 --> 01:35:07,960
I don't see so good, so I missed.

773
01:35:07,960 --> 01:35:09,960
Then they ran away.

774
01:35:09,960 --> 01:35:11,960
I ran after them.

775
01:35:11,960 --> 01:35:13,960
I tried to shoot them in the back,

776
01:35:13,960 --> 01:35:15,960
but I don't know if it's so good either.

777
01:35:15,960 --> 01:35:17,960
I don't play video games,

778
01:35:17,960 --> 01:35:52,199
so I don't know what that's a reference to.

779
01:35:52,199 --> 01:36:12,359
I've seen it, but it's good.

780
01:36:12,359 --> 01:36:18,119
Siri, take a note.

781
01:36:18,119 --> 01:36:21,000
What's the note?

782
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:24,260
Inside the cave.

783
01:36:24,260 --> 01:36:26,260
Sharing two sticks with a guy,

784
01:36:26,260 --> 01:36:28,949
some homeless guy, threw up in his mouth.

785
01:36:28,949 --> 01:36:31,579
Mickey Mouse comes in

786
01:36:31,579 --> 01:36:34,520
and drains all my battery from my iPod.

787
01:36:34,520 --> 01:36:40,539
I kiss him.

788
01:36:40,539 --> 01:36:43,989
I knew it was coming.

789
01:36:43,989 --> 01:36:45,989
Drains all my battery from my iPod.

790
01:36:45,989 --> 01:36:52,390
I kiss him.

791
01:36:52,390 --> 01:36:54,630
What the fuck?

792
01:36:54,630 --> 01:36:56,630
I'm so weird. I swear to God I'm not high right now.

793
01:36:56,630 --> 01:36:58,810
I thought I was blocking the face cam.

794
01:36:58,810 --> 01:37:02,520
I actually thought I was blocking this face cam.

795
01:37:02,520 --> 01:37:04,520
I was like, oh shit, I gotta get out of the way.

796
01:37:04,520 --> 01:37:07,779
There's another face cam.

797
01:37:07,779 --> 01:37:11,619
I swear to God I'm not on hard mode.

798
01:37:11,619 --> 01:37:16,859
What the fuck?

799
01:37:16,859 --> 01:37:19,420
That was really good.

800
01:37:19,420 --> 01:37:21,420
Let me take some inventory here.

801
01:37:21,420 --> 01:37:23,420
Let me see where we're at.

802
01:37:23,420 --> 01:37:25,659
And I gotta pee.

803
01:37:25,659 --> 01:37:27,659
Let's see.

804
01:37:27,659 --> 01:37:30,600
1,900 bucks is in the pool?

805
01:37:30,600 --> 01:37:33,800
Let me see. I don't wanna spoil anything.

806
01:37:33,800 --> 01:37:35,800
We are getting close.

807
01:37:35,800 --> 01:37:38,229
We're getting close.

808
01:37:38,229 --> 01:37:40,729
I'm gonna go pee. I'll be right back.

809
01:37:40,729 --> 01:37:42,729
We've got about 50 or 60 more videos

810
01:37:42,729 --> 01:37:45,859
until we get to the baby sensory shit.

811
01:37:45,859 --> 01:37:50,649
Which I have no idea how that's gonna go.

812
01:37:50,649 --> 01:37:52,649
I have no idea.

813
01:37:52,649 --> 01:37:58,539
And by the way,

814
01:37:58,539 --> 01:38:00,539
well I'm not gonna say this yet because I'm not done.

815
01:38:00,539 --> 01:38:03,609
I could watch another compilation.

816
01:38:03,609 --> 01:38:05,609
I'm into that. This is fun.

817
01:38:05,609 --> 01:38:09,319
This actually is fun to do.

818
01:38:09,319 --> 01:38:11,319
I'm having a great time.

819
01:38:11,319 --> 01:38:13,319
I'll be right back. I'm just gonna go pee.

820
01:38:13,319 --> 01:38:16,310
And we'll keep going. See you guys in a minute.

821
01:38:16,310 --> 01:43:08,310
Hello. I've returned.

822
01:43:08,310 --> 01:43:15,670
I found my lip balm. Thank God.

823
01:43:15,670 --> 01:43:17,670
Alright. Let's keep going.

824
01:43:17,670 --> 01:43:19,670
We've got about 60 videos left in this playlist

825
01:43:19,670 --> 01:43:21,670
and then we're gonna move to the baby sensory.

826
01:43:21,670 --> 01:43:25,750
It is Burt's Bees.

827
01:43:25,750 --> 01:43:34,260
Why'd I say hello like that?

828
01:43:34,260 --> 01:43:38,789
I don't know.

829
01:43:38,789 --> 01:43:40,789
This is a lot of fun though.

830
01:43:40,789 --> 01:43:43,350
I've been doing this and didn't do it for a long time.

831
01:43:43,350 --> 01:43:45,350
Because I was like, I don't even know how to do that

832
01:43:45,350 --> 01:43:47,350
or where to start or how would I even

833
01:43:47,350 --> 01:43:54,500
do I even really care. It's fun.

834
01:43:54,500 --> 01:43:56,500
I'm not gonna do this every single stream.

835
01:43:56,500 --> 01:43:59,829
Did I find my vape?

836
01:43:59,829 --> 01:44:03,909
Normie?

837
01:44:03,909 --> 01:44:06,659
I'm not a normie.

838
01:44:06,659 --> 01:44:14,329
Alright, let's go.

839
01:44:14,329 --> 01:44:16,890
There we go.

840
01:44:16,890 --> 01:44:24,739
Let us continue.

841
01:44:24,739 --> 01:44:28,970
This needs to be like over here or something.

842
01:44:28,970 --> 01:44:30,970
Let me brighten this up.

843
01:44:30,970 --> 01:44:45,939
It looks like I'm sitting in front of a campfire.

844
01:44:45,939 --> 01:44:54,260
Oh, that looks worse.

845
01:44:54,260 --> 01:44:56,260
Look at how much more handsome I look when it's up here.

846
01:44:56,260 --> 01:44:59,909
Lighting is just

847
01:44:59,909 --> 01:45:03,109
matters so much. Look at this.

848
01:45:03,109 --> 01:45:05,479
This is with a light directly in my face.

849
01:45:05,479 --> 01:45:08,409
Look at that.

850
01:45:08,409 --> 01:45:11,159
Look at the difference. It's just so much better.

851
01:45:11,159 --> 01:45:14,039
Down here, that's why.

852
01:45:14,039 --> 01:45:16,039
It's because I have a big brow bone. Can I make it stay up here?

853
01:45:16,039 --> 01:45:22,739
It actually might stay up here.

854
01:45:22,739 --> 01:45:25,479
Dude, look at that.

855
01:45:25,479 --> 01:45:27,479
I have like a real light in my face now.

856
01:45:27,479 --> 01:45:35,420
Okay. I just can't move that much.

857
01:45:35,420 --> 01:45:38,039
Actually, that's dangerous for it to be up there.

858
01:45:38,039 --> 01:45:43,739
Alright, let's go.

859
01:45:43,739 --> 01:45:45,739
Back to it. Did I scam?

860
01:45:45,739 --> 01:45:48,680
Is it 2000?

861
01:45:48,680 --> 01:45:50,979
He zonked.

862
01:45:50,979 --> 01:46:01,590
Not yet!

863
01:46:01,590 --> 01:46:04,340
Is it 19? Okay. I'm making sure I didn't scam.

864
01:46:04,340 --> 01:46:06,899
Here we go. I am ready.

865
01:46:06,899 --> 01:46:18,149
Can you see it?

866
01:46:18,149 --> 01:46:25,819
Volume back up.

867
01:46:25,819 --> 01:46:32,600
Let's go.

868
01:46:52,170 --> 01:46:54,170
No!

869
01:47:05,109 --> 01:47:07,109
Okay, so my GoPro setup isn't perfect yet.

870
01:47:07,109 --> 01:47:09,109
And I'm glad you guys are getting a kick out of it.

871
01:47:09,109 --> 01:47:11,109
But, I really want it to be better.

872
01:47:11,109 --> 01:47:13,109
This video

873
01:47:13,109 --> 01:47:15,109
exemplifies why

874
01:47:15,109 --> 01:47:17,109
I need to work on this so much.

875
01:47:17,109 --> 01:47:19,109
It's really hard to keep that

876
01:47:19,109 --> 01:47:21,109
long, stiff street pole

877
01:47:21,109 --> 01:47:23,109
all the way out there that you need

878
01:47:23,109 --> 01:47:25,109
for the 360 cam to work right.

879
01:47:25,109 --> 01:47:28,250
He's got a lawnmower

880
01:47:28,250 --> 01:47:30,250
and he's like a little kid right there.

881
01:47:30,250 --> 01:48:02,619
Just scary.

882
01:48:02,619 --> 01:48:04,619
I love this game.

883
01:48:04,619 --> 01:48:21,300
At the end I almost got me.

884
01:48:56,619 --> 01:48:58,619
That was really cool. I wouldn't say that was funny. That was cool.

885
01:48:58,619 --> 01:49:22,279
What?

886
01:49:24,279 --> 01:49:26,279
Why? Do you see anything else?

887
01:49:30,710 --> 01:49:32,710
Kids nowadays.

888
01:49:34,710 --> 01:49:36,710
My baby must be sending letters.

889
01:49:36,710 --> 01:49:38,710
I'll be back in a hurry, great grandma.

890
01:49:38,710 --> 01:49:40,710
Always in a hurry.

891
01:49:46,710 --> 01:49:48,710
Isn't that what Santa does?

892
01:49:48,710 --> 01:49:50,710
It was from my heart.

893
01:49:54,710 --> 01:49:56,710
She doesn't get it.

894
01:50:00,710 --> 01:50:02,710
What's going on?

895
01:50:02,710 --> 01:50:05,909
How? I feel so bad.

896
01:50:16,250 --> 01:50:18,250
We can always work things.

897
01:50:18,250 --> 01:50:20,250
Great grandma, you always know

898
01:50:20,250 --> 01:50:22,250
just what to say.

899
01:50:28,250 --> 01:50:34,460
That was cute. I like how cute that one is.

900
01:50:59,590 --> 01:51:01,590
How to save people in the elevator in Black Mesa.

901
01:51:01,590 --> 01:51:25,449
What?

902
01:51:25,449 --> 01:51:27,449
Can you actually get them out?

903
01:51:27,449 --> 01:51:33,659
Oh shit.

904
01:51:33,659 --> 01:51:37,880
Goodbye.

905
01:51:43,590 --> 01:51:45,590
This is your content, Jerma.

906
01:51:53,590 --> 01:51:55,590
Bright.

907
01:52:01,590 --> 01:52:07,539
This is why I can't play Oblivion.

908
01:52:07,539 --> 01:52:09,539
Ever.

909
01:52:09,539 --> 01:52:11,539
985.

910
01:52:25,539 --> 01:52:27,539
Just auto fill on your iPhone.

911
01:52:35,539 --> 01:52:37,539
What's happening? That was weird.

912
01:52:37,539 --> 01:52:44,840
No.

913
01:52:58,840 --> 01:53:01,460
What?

914
01:53:01,460 --> 01:53:03,460
Is jellyfish a herb?

915
01:53:03,460 --> 01:53:10,380
That was close.

916
01:53:10,380 --> 01:53:16,649
Is it 3am?

917
01:53:16,649 --> 01:53:22,539
Oh don't.

918
01:53:22,539 --> 01:53:25,800
So is it any wonder people are afraid

919
01:53:25,800 --> 01:53:27,800
of technology?

920
01:53:27,800 --> 01:53:31,899
Have you ever had a dream

921
01:53:31,899 --> 01:53:33,899
that

922
01:53:33,899 --> 01:53:35,899
you had

923
01:53:35,899 --> 01:53:37,899
you could

924
01:53:37,899 --> 01:53:39,899
you want

925
01:53:39,899 --> 01:53:41,899
you could do so

926
01:53:41,899 --> 01:53:43,899
you could

927
01:53:43,899 --> 01:53:45,899
you want him to do

928
01:53:45,899 --> 01:53:47,899
you so much you could do anything?

929
01:53:47,899 --> 01:53:49,899
That's a great video.

930
01:53:49,899 --> 01:53:52,329
It's just a good video.

931
01:53:52,329 --> 01:53:54,329
Pay no attention, it's fine.

932
01:53:54,329 --> 01:53:56,329
You want me to go up there?

933
01:53:56,329 --> 01:53:58,329
Trick or treating at my house?

934
01:53:58,329 --> 01:54:05,560
I think I've seen this.

935
01:54:05,560 --> 01:54:11,689
Hey look.

936
01:54:15,449 --> 01:54:17,449
Thanks Jerma.

937
01:54:17,449 --> 01:54:19,449
So weird.

938
01:54:31,020 --> 01:54:33,020
I'm so pale.

939
01:54:33,020 --> 01:54:35,020
I look like a fucking

940
01:54:35,020 --> 01:54:39,689
look at how weird I look.

941
01:55:19,029 --> 01:55:23,260
I've never seen this.

942
01:55:23,260 --> 01:55:25,689
I just did not expect that at all.

943
01:55:25,689 --> 01:55:34,899
You know why

944
01:55:34,899 --> 01:55:36,899
this is so surprising to me?

945
01:55:36,899 --> 01:55:38,899
I've never seen Rocky 2.

946
01:55:38,899 --> 01:55:41,529
I just know that Rocky's a guy

947
01:55:41,529 --> 01:55:43,529
and he wears like pajamas and works out

948
01:55:43,529 --> 01:55:45,529
and then fights people.

949
01:55:45,529 --> 01:55:47,529
I've only seen like an hour of Rocky total.

950
01:56:33,399 --> 01:56:38,970
Hey Brad.

951
01:56:38,970 --> 01:56:40,970
I bet you can't laugh without

952
01:56:40,970 --> 01:56:43,909
smiling.

953
01:56:43,909 --> 01:56:46,470
What are you talking about?

954
01:56:46,470 --> 01:56:48,470
Oh, seriously.

955
01:56:48,470 --> 01:56:50,470
It's not even that hard. Watch.

956
01:57:09,640 --> 01:57:14,949
This is freaking me out.

957
01:57:14,949 --> 01:57:32,979
That was freaking me out. Loud.

958
01:57:32,979 --> 01:57:39,579
23 in the chamber.

959
01:57:39,579 --> 01:57:41,579
They ain't found me yet, but when they do

960
01:57:41,579 --> 01:57:43,579
they're gonna be surprised.

961
01:58:23,500 --> 01:58:41,779
It's the zoomed in

962
01:58:41,779 --> 01:58:46,069
close up. He hit that

963
01:58:46,069 --> 01:58:48,069
hard. You can see his whole

964
01:58:48,069 --> 01:58:50,760
body like jiggles.

965
01:58:50,760 --> 01:58:52,760
Hold on. I've never seen some of these videos before.

966
01:58:52,760 --> 01:58:56,090
Jeez.

967
01:58:56,090 --> 01:58:58,090
Just look at this.

968
01:59:00,090 --> 01:59:02,090
Let us have a moment of silence for this man's

969
01:59:02,090 --> 01:59:04,090
fallen brothers as you see.

970
01:59:04,090 --> 01:59:06,090
It's, okay.

971
01:59:06,090 --> 01:59:08,090
It's the fact that it's just, it's not necessarily the commentary.

972
01:59:08,090 --> 01:59:10,090
It's just the, oh my god.

973
01:59:10,090 --> 01:59:12,090
How? That would be so awful.

974
01:59:12,090 --> 01:59:14,649
Okay.

975
01:59:14,649 --> 01:59:19,380
What do we add? Is it 22 or 23?

976
01:59:19,380 --> 01:59:24,170
Alright.

977
01:59:24,170 --> 01:59:26,340
I actually gotta relax.

978
01:59:26,340 --> 01:59:28,340
Because this still is in place in Baby Sensory

979
01:59:28,340 --> 01:59:30,340
and I don't think I'm gonna be able to handle, I can't handle Baby Sensory.

980
01:59:30,340 --> 01:59:32,899
I don't think I'll be able to handle it.

981
01:59:32,899 --> 01:59:37,819
Let's go.

982
01:59:37,819 --> 01:59:58,140
All

983
01:59:58,140 --> 02:00:00,140
the

984
02:00:00,140 --> 02:00:07,960
All the

985
02:00:07,960 --> 02:00:09,960
Shouldn't

986
02:00:09,960 --> 02:00:13,220
have

987
02:00:13,220 --> 02:00:17,640
Packed

988
02:00:17,640 --> 02:00:19,640
you kill the child.

989
02:00:19,640 --> 02:00:21,640
Amazing mission complete.

990
02:00:21,640 --> 02:00:23,640
That right there is why you are the best.

991
02:00:23,640 --> 02:00:25,640
Everyone knows her

992
02:00:25,640 --> 02:00:27,640
father is a lunatic. He was in here

993
02:00:27,640 --> 02:00:29,640
tonight. Raven.

994
02:00:29,640 --> 02:00:32,899
Mm-hmm.

995
02:00:32,899 --> 02:01:01,140
Um, is it what a mint julep? Okay. What the fuck just holy shit. Okay, that was scary

996
02:01:02,899 --> 02:01:06,100
Wait, wait, hold on. Wait, wait, wait, I got

997
02:01:06,500 --> 02:01:11,380
Six I gave points for the tattoo reveal. I thought that was completely unique

998
02:01:11,699 --> 02:01:14,579
I also gave points because she had delicious barbecue

999
02:01:14,659 --> 02:01:17,939
I took points away because I was stung by a bee for the first time

1000
02:01:18,340 --> 02:01:22,979
And I think that is attributed to the 50 000 bees that are kept on the premises

1001
02:01:34,039 --> 02:01:36,039
Oh, look at them they're having so much fun

1002
02:01:39,850 --> 02:01:44,569
It's all right. You know, here's what's happening here. They both want the other one to chase them

1003
02:01:46,199 --> 02:01:51,560
So when they're realizing that they're getting stuck in like a math loop of like their ai won't do it

1004
02:01:55,750 --> 02:02:05,449
They keep resetting

1005
02:02:05,449 --> 02:02:13,960
Like why have you not chased me yet? I'm supposed to you sit. Well, why are you not chasing me? That was fun. That was cute

1006
02:02:15,779 --> 02:02:18,180

Can you imagine that happening to you?

1022
02:03:53,800 --> 02:03:55,800
That was really close

1023
02:03:59,029 --> 02:04:08,810
What was what what was this one titled protocols not banished in origin it's

1024
02:04:09,930 --> 02:04:28,109
Sturdier than I expected. I don't play halo. I don't get it cortana

1025
02:04:28,510 --> 02:04:44,760
No problem

1026
02:04:47,340 --> 02:05:08,729
I'm all right. I'm all right. I'm all right

1027
02:05:37,439 --> 02:05:40,640
I knew it was coming. I love this video

1028
02:05:43,789 --> 02:05:53,000
Look at how pissed this cat gets. This cat is so angry that the dog farted god

1029
02:05:56,140 --> 02:05:59,100
The end of that that ad went on a very long time

1030
02:05:59,579 --> 02:06:03,199
What how why do you laugh at this laughed at nothing?

1031
02:06:05,439 --> 02:06:09,439
Because I because I know i'm gonna laugh at this video and the thanos one was holy shit

1032
02:06:09,439 --> 02:06:12,399
It was a miracle. I was able to hold through that one and then oh my god

1033
02:06:12,399 --> 02:06:15,359
Here comes like one of my favorite funny cat hits the dog for farting videos

1034
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:54,760
Nope. Okay. I got it 24. It's fake. I just it's still funny

1035
02:06:56,010 --> 02:06:58,010
No, no more thanos shit

1036
02:07:27,279 --> 02:07:32,250
That's so annoying. What a bunch of fucking assholes. What a bunch of dicks

1037
02:07:35,119 --> 02:07:37,119
This is the last video in this playlist

1038
02:07:39,449 --> 02:07:42,970
Just okay, it wouldn't be funny to me if it was anywhere else, but he's at like the airport

1039
02:07:43,680 --> 02:07:47,039
He has to show his id and the fact that they're like very far away

1040
02:07:47,039 --> 02:07:53,930
That's the only reason why it was funny if they were anywhere else. We are at

1041
02:07:55,350 --> 02:08:03,630
$2,500 this playlist is over. That does not mean that this is over

1042
02:08:05,020 --> 02:08:07,020
Coming up next is hard mode

1043
02:08:07,260 --> 02:08:09,739
And baby sensory videos and after that

1044
02:08:10,779 --> 02:08:17,899
We might actually do a few more just compilations. Maybe some of the mods can um, I don't want to say this because I don't want a fucking

1045
02:08:18,779 --> 02:08:26,060
Five trillion people to hit up the mods, but maybe another compilation or so get a couple maybe one or two more

1046
02:08:26,220 --> 02:08:30,239
What's the pool for?

1047
02:08:30,239 --> 02:08:34,159
So at the end of this stream i'm going to divvy this up and we're going to give it to charity

1048
02:08:34,920 --> 02:08:40,920
So I have a charity in mind that I might just give the whole thing to find out. Well, not not a charity necessarily

1049
02:08:41,239 --> 02:08:50,199
But an organization, so this is fun 2,500 so far. All right, let me let's watch this last one and see if it's going to work

1050
02:08:50,199 --> 02:08:52,199
Work

1051
02:09:00,880 --> 02:09:04,409
Okay, we're good

1052
02:09:04,409 --> 02:09:07,420
Tell what the pool is for in your title

1053
02:09:07,420 --> 02:09:19,880
Uh, okay. Yeah, i'll update the title because now we're nice lighting that wasn't in the playlist. This was just autoplay

1054
02:09:20,119 --> 02:09:32,590
What are you serious? Okay. All right. Give me one second. Let me uh,

1055
02:09:34,170 --> 02:09:37,930
Let me just instead of putting in the title. It's probably easier to do this

1056
02:09:38,329 --> 02:09:45,420
I'll make it a little smaller too. So it's not

1057
02:09:45,500 --> 02:09:53,500
Okay, uh getting a lot of community subs too. Uh, thank you. Kiki lime pie for the 10

1058
02:09:54,359 --> 02:09:58,760
Uh, thank you oi pmc for the 10 vessel for the five and then sarah ryan

1059
02:09:59,479 --> 02:10:06,460
Saran ocean for the 25 community subs. I don't I don't know if I can handle this. This is gonna be really weird. Um

1060
02:10:07,319 --> 02:10:09,720
I was gonna have a notepad open where I write my feelings down

1061
02:10:09,720 --> 02:10:14,829
But I think that you laugh you lose shit still is fine. So let me get that on

1062
02:10:14,989 --> 02:10:26,560
Let's get the first one on here. So this one is oh god

1063
02:10:28,409 --> 02:10:34,270
This is still you laugh you lose by the way. I just found these on youtube. I don't know how they are

1064
02:10:35,159 --> 02:10:37,960
I don't know anything really about them. I have no idea

1065
02:10:38,579 --> 02:10:56,319
Absolutely, no clue here comes a baby early learning sensory video three two one

1066
02:10:58,399 --> 02:11:01,529
Hello, baby

1067
02:11:04,699 --> 02:11:09,630
Circle

1068
02:11:14,970 --> 02:11:34,010
Okay, it's like breathing i'm just thinking about the fact that i'm doing this right now i'm actually watching these and it's it's making

1069
02:11:43,119 --> 02:11:45,760
This is scary. It's kind of scary for adults

1070
02:11:53,819 --> 02:12:10,359
So what this supposed to be high contrast is a clockwork orange. I'm about to veto this

1071
02:12:12,590 --> 02:12:15,279
all gone

1072
02:12:15,840 --> 02:12:17,840
I think I have to veto this whole thing

1073
02:12:28,489 --> 02:12:36,079
Fucking cloud music in the background is it is it circle? What is it? It's a circle. It's a circle

1074
02:12:41,500 --> 02:12:43,340
Okay, um

1075
02:12:43,340 --> 02:12:46,220
I'm gonna i'm gonna just go ahead and uh say this

1076
02:12:47,449 --> 02:12:49,579
um

1077
02:12:49,579 --> 02:12:51,579
Feed your babies a well-balanced diet, please

1078
02:12:51,979 --> 02:12:52,939
and

1079
02:12:52,939 --> 02:12:57,100
Like you have like objects in your house like keys and stuff. You can play like peekaboo

1080
02:12:57,180 --> 02:12:59,899
I don't know if I want I don't know if i'd want a baby to sit down

1081
02:13:00,380 --> 02:13:04,380
This is 22 minutes. I don't think I want a baby sit down and like get we'll see this

1082
02:13:05,260 --> 02:13:09,180
I want to like draw this in a notebook and be like that's a look that's a circle

1083
02:13:09,579 --> 02:13:16,489
I feel like if you have this on autoplay do it on times two speed

1084
02:13:17,050 --> 02:13:21,850
All right, maybe there's a bunch of science about it that like this is like developed like it's okay

1085
02:13:21,850 --> 02:13:24,810
You know like um when adults play a brain age for the ds

1086
02:13:25,369 --> 02:13:40,319
Maybe that maybe this is literally just brain age for an infant. I have no idea. Okay

1087
02:13:47,640 --> 02:13:49,239
Shit is for babies

1088
02:13:49,239 --> 02:13:51,479
It's it is i'm getting scared

1089
02:13:51,960 --> 02:14:25,550
I have to put it like a warning here because it's gonna be um, this is times two

1090
02:14:25,710 --> 02:14:37,180
But what in the meantime, uh, if we if there's any more you laugh you lose compilations

1091
02:14:38,270 --> 02:14:41,550
I'd love to watch them. Maybe just we can get them vetted quickly or something

1092
02:14:41,550 --> 02:14:45,069
But um, I ain't watching i'm done after this. This is fucking what a shit idea

1093
02:14:45,310 --> 02:14:48,510
This is one of the worst ideas i've ever had

1094
02:14:48,510 --> 02:14:50,909
Well ever one of the worst ideas i've ever had

1095
02:14:53,850 --> 02:14:55,850
Uh, so i'm gonna put a warning here first

1096
02:14:55,850 --> 02:15:10,590
Okay, there we go. I'm not doing all 22 minutes. We're going to another you laugh you lose

1097
02:15:11,710 --> 02:15:30,890
Okay, here we go

1098
02:15:30,890 --> 02:15:46,119
crazy

1099
02:15:54,439 --> 02:15:56,439
I forgot it was in times two speed

1100
02:15:56,840 --> 02:16:01,479
I forgot it was in times two speed man. I thought like what the fuck is what is this alien video?

1101
02:16:01,479 --> 02:16:10,430
We're watching I was like, why is it like this? I forgot it was times two

1102
02:16:10,909 --> 02:16:19,680
But yeah, if a mod has another good compilation

1103
02:16:20,380 --> 02:16:22,380
Uh, is it just even when you find?

1104
02:16:23,100 --> 02:17:00,030
Okay, here we go. I'm doing this up to up to five to ten minutes and that's it. I gotta turn that off

1105
02:17:00,030 --> 02:17:13,309
It's too much. This is horrifying. Okay, i'm done

1106
02:17:24,840 --> 02:17:29,879
No, i'm not gonna keep it up and keep it times two. Okay, there are 30 000 people here

1107
02:17:31,399 --> 02:17:34,520
What a weird like it would I feel like if I clicked on this stream

1108
02:17:35,520 --> 02:17:42,909
They're watching a times two speed baby sensory video. Why are they doing this? What's wrong with them?

1109
02:17:45,899 --> 02:17:50,780
This is cultish at this point if I was just sitting here like two times baby sensory videos

1110
02:17:52,139 --> 02:17:55,819
I this is getting I don't know. It's freaking me out. I don't think I can do

1111
02:17:58,459 --> 02:18:01,819
All right, i'll do times two for for 10 more seconds ready

1112
02:18:08,959 --> 02:18:10,159
Okay

1113
02:18:10,159 --> 02:18:30,010
It is wario where holy shit that person get that what's happening

1114
02:18:35,690 --> 02:18:39,610

1115
02:18:39,850 --> 02:18:42,569
Get the fuck out of here. Get this fucking thing off the screen right now

1116
02:18:43,290 --> 02:18:53,870
No way. Yeah, but like like 3 000 people have left the stream. This is off

1117
02:18:55,450 --> 02:19:01,610
Like immediately let's put on a you laugh you lose

1118
02:19:03,850 --> 02:19:05,850
I've got a lot of ideas on this stream

1119
02:19:06,250 --> 02:19:13,399
Some of them need to go through the first phase of like the carbon filter for your sink. Holy shit

1120
02:19:20,040 --> 02:19:27,340
Okay, best one guy moment. All right. Let me give me one second

1121
02:19:27,340 --> 02:19:29,340
Let me just look at to see if we have any more compilations to do

1122
02:19:42,809 --> 02:19:50,799
Do we do we have any more wario where?

1123
02:19:59,229 --> 02:20:01,229
I don't think we even have any more

1124
02:20:01,229 --> 02:20:06,879
All right. Here we go. I got one. I got one. Got one. Got one. Got one. Got one. Got one

All right. Here we go. I really wish I had a shopping cart right now. There's none around

1133
02:21:41,870 --> 02:21:47,309
There we go. Is that meat?

02:23:23,049 --> 02:23:25,049
Look feel it feel it

This is smashing stuff in your house compilation. These are zoomer sensory videos

1146
02:24:31,129 --> 02:24:33,129
I can laugh at that because that was funny

1147
02:24:50,079 --> 02:24:52,239
Hold on I i'll give it to you i'll give it to you

Go back did I miss one? Sure, please, uh, get a better playlist. This is 2013

1149
02:25:09,159 --> 02:25:17,360
Well, we're off the original playlist. I've been here for two and a half hours doing this. Holy shit

Damn. All right. I'm not going back to baby sensory

1151
02:25:26,270 --> 02:25:36,250
No, all right. I'm gonna finish this one out and we'll get another one. Okay. Here we go

1152
02:25:36,569 --> 02:25:47,229
Cheeseburger hand pies are a fun twist on a classic meal in a large

1153
02:25:49,690 --> 02:25:55,129
Fun hold on

1154
02:25:55,209 --> 02:25:58,250
Let's get oh man that hurts

1155
02:26:09,680 --> 02:26:17,360
Holy shit

1156
02:26:24,360 --> 02:26:26,360
Oh that sounds like his teeth

1157
02:26:41,709 --> 02:27:10,780
I don't get it

1158
02:27:10,780 --> 02:27:24,860
Yeah, these are too quick for me to react to my brain like moves on the baby video was better

1159
02:27:32,989 --> 02:27:35,309
When's auto's birthday auto's birthday is

1160
02:27:36,190 --> 02:27:38,190
Uh, we don't know probably somewhere around march

1161
02:27:39,719 --> 02:27:41,719
Because auto's a rescue. So I don't know exactly when

1162
02:27:42,360 --> 02:27:44,799
But they think march somewhere between march and may

1163
02:27:44,959 --> 02:27:52,959
What happened to the what happened to the tv resolution burning guy? It was a joke. We got had

1164
02:27:53,790 --> 02:27:58,350
Uh, he sent another video that was that was him doing a rick roll. So

1165
02:27:59,549 --> 02:28:10,750
That was the ultimate one guy for sure. We're on animal videos. All right, let's let's let's let's get this one out

1166
02:28:10,989 --> 02:28:28,010
And then i'm gonna take one more break and we'll see if we get another one coming up. What's up house?

1167
02:28:28,959 --> 02:28:35,079
All right, it's so hot

1168
02:28:36,909 --> 02:28:38,909
I could feel that all the way over here

1169
02:28:38,989 --> 02:28:44,729
What on america's money's home videos do we just watch an old episode of america's money's home videos

1170
02:28:46,590 --> 02:28:53,739
That actually sounds awesome

1171
02:28:53,739 --> 02:28:58,059
I'm just realizing what this poor guy just did that you what what just happened the whole tree fell apart

1172
02:29:22,059 --> 02:29:29,629
Hold on I need to see what you're talking about somebody said they thought that this was a

1173
02:29:30,270 --> 02:29:32,270
Teller was like this guy was a dog

1174
02:29:33,790 --> 02:29:37,680
It is a dog

1175
02:29:37,680 --> 02:29:46,079
What are you talking about? I thought that guy was a dog

1176
02:29:47,149 --> 02:30:09,799
Yeah, because it was a dog

1177
02:30:09,799 --> 02:30:13,079
Oh

1178
02:30:13,079 --> 02:30:15,719
I was waiting for like the chandelier to fall

1179
02:30:15,719 --> 02:30:22,079
Like I thought it was gonna be like the chandelier was gonna go like in the background or something

1180
02:30:22,479 --> 02:30:32,639
I was like, what the hell is this video?

1181
02:30:32,639 --> 02:30:42,059
Watch how it's made. Are we going just full react andy today? Is that what it is? All right. Let me go pee

1182
02:30:42,620 --> 02:30:48,459
We'll get we'll let me get like two or three more ready to go. I'll be right back

1183
02:30:50,489 --> 02:30:52,489
Do how it's made on times 10 speed

1184
02:30:53,049 --> 02:30:57,930
Dude, my favorite part is the zoomer sensory videos

1185
02:30:58,860 --> 02:31:02,860
Ah, that's so fun. I'll be right back. You just peed

1186
02:31:04,799 --> 02:34:25,209
I've been drinking water. Somebody said do a baby sensory stream where you treat us like babies. I don't think so

1187
02:34:25,450 --> 02:34:42,200
All right. Here's what we're gonna do. I only really planned on this stream being about three hours

1188
02:34:43,040 --> 02:34:50,799
So we will watch maybe one or two little things here and then I was gonna be live tomorrow

1189
02:34:51,440 --> 02:34:53,440
with monster rancher

1190
02:34:55,100 --> 02:34:59,069
End of the stream voice not yet

1191
02:34:59,069 --> 02:35:04,909
I mean, there's only somebody like hours in a row of of just meme content that your brain can accept that like

1192
02:35:05,450 --> 02:35:07,450
Facebook video

1193
02:35:07,549 --> 02:35:11,629
Where I got locked and had and that added a thousand dollars to the pool

1194
02:35:14,030 --> 02:35:17,229
Yeah, I I mean after three hours of this you kind of funny it out

1195
02:35:19,209 --> 02:35:21,209
But I want to finish monster rancher

1196
02:35:28,170 --> 02:35:30,170
And what else what else?

1197
02:35:33,479 --> 02:35:36,920
I don't think we'll be in monster ranch for that much longer. I don't think so

1198
02:35:37,719 --> 02:35:48,030
You but I can't the baby sensory thing was a fun idea and then in practice

1199
02:35:48,829 --> 02:35:52,030
Was just way too much that's way too much for me and way too much for you

1200
02:35:53,049 --> 02:35:55,370
Especially at times two speed. Oh, no way

1201
02:35:58,940 --> 02:36:08,159
It was horrible

1202
02:36:08,159 --> 02:36:23,899
Yeah, I don't think I can put on america's funnystone videos like the one that's the current season. It was perfect

1203
02:36:24,879 --> 02:36:27,520
I mean, I think it was funny once I realized I had to leave

1204
02:36:28,159 --> 02:36:35,450
So let me let me go over this real quick too though

1205
02:36:39,149 --> 02:36:42,350
We want more we want more watch the dancing fruits one

1206
02:36:45,020 --> 02:36:48,700
All right, i'll put on the dancing fruit one and then after that i'm probably just gonna go

1207
02:36:50,379 --> 02:36:52,379
And we'll be live tomorrow with video games

1208
02:36:58,239 --> 02:37:02,270
It's too much

1209
02:37:02,270 --> 02:37:04,829
You know those like three plus hour long

1210
02:37:05,469 --> 02:37:09,819
the meme compilations

1211
02:37:09,819 --> 02:37:11,819
after hour number two of that

1212
02:37:12,750 --> 02:37:15,469
I kind of I kind of want to go like eat a sandwich

1213
02:37:19,739 --> 02:37:25,340
All right. What was it going over here? Okay, let's put on the baby sensory dancing fruit one

1214
02:37:28,719 --> 02:37:34,270
Uh, let me break down where this money's gonna go by the way. There is a dancing fruit one. You're right

1215
02:37:48,540 --> 02:37:50,459
Please peep the horror

1216
02:37:50,459 --> 02:37:55,870
Um, I think I did that for like five straight minutes on the sensory stream. I don't think you need me to do that again

1217
02:37:57,739 --> 02:37:59,260
All right, let's break this down

1218
02:37:59,260 --> 02:38:04,840
Coming back. I don't think that's even accurate anymore the flashing lights thing

1219
02:38:06,270 --> 02:38:15,719
Hey, who knows but i'm this maybe this stuff isn't like very engaging to a child's brain. I don't know just in case

1220
02:38:16,360 --> 02:38:35,120
Okay, uh, okay fruit fruit salad dance party. Hey, you just peeped the horror for 20 minutes. Yeah

1221
02:38:35,760 --> 02:38:48,170
I can say I kind of like this video

1222
02:39:02,600 --> 02:39:06,559
This this ain't bad this one's not bad

1223
02:39:07,200 --> 02:39:14,079
How do you guys feel right now?

1224
02:39:14,079 --> 02:39:17,040
Like this very second if I asked you and I had a piece of paper and I wrote it down

1225
02:39:17,520 --> 02:39:23,899
How do you feel good chill groovy?

1226
02:39:25,379 --> 02:39:29,690
Stimulated. Yep mind controlled

1227
02:39:37,209 --> 02:39:40,809
Hungry

1228
02:39:40,809 --> 02:39:46,520
How long does this go for?

1229
02:39:46,520 --> 02:39:48,520
Oh my it's just it's this for 20 minutes

1230
02:39:49,079 --> 02:39:58,010
Does the song change?

1231
02:39:58,010 --> 02:40:07,870
Don't spoil the video

1232
02:40:07,870 --> 02:40:09,559
Somebody just came in

1233
02:40:09,559 --> 02:40:12,840
and said

1234
02:40:12,840 --> 02:40:16,840
Dude, what do we do here? Is this guy just opening up and watching baby videos?

1235
02:40:20,510 --> 02:40:23,309
This is exactly what I told you was going to happen

1236
02:40:24,030 --> 02:40:28,959
Oh shit

1237
02:40:29,040 --> 02:40:30,000
No

1238
02:40:30,000 --> 02:40:34,959
What the fuck? Oh, well, is it all right?

1239
02:40:44,860 --> 02:40:47,389
Is it turning on?

1240
02:40:47,389 --> 02:40:51,229
Okay. No, no, it's all right. It's all right

1241
02:40:51,229 --> 02:40:52,750
so anyways

1242
02:40:52,750 --> 02:40:57,309
Uh, that's exactly what I told you. I told you exactly that's what was gonna happen and it exactly did

1243
02:41:01,610 --> 02:41:06,489
Okay, so uh, no, this is not what we do here. This is one of many things that happen on this channel

1244
02:41:11,069 --> 02:41:23,959
You were vibing. All right, let's vibe for another 30 seconds. What's wrong with your lighting? I've been here for two hours

1245
02:41:25,360 --> 02:41:28,239
This is like a lamp. I have that's just right here. It's like a little

1246
02:41:29,120 --> 02:41:39,549
digital lamp thing

1247
02:41:39,549 --> 02:41:42,270
All right, if the next fruit is a banana

1248
02:41:42,909 --> 02:41:44,670
I will add a hundred dollars

1249
02:41:44,670 --> 02:42:10,110
Somebody said oh wow, man. It's a bunch of little dancing fruits just for me. Oh, no. Yeah, it didn't change you, right?

1250
02:42:11,069 --> 02:42:20,079
Uh banana, right?

1251
02:42:20,079 --> 02:42:38,000
I'm not even kidding. This is your worst stream of the year two bad nominations are closed. Oh, yeah

1252
02:42:48,959 --> 02:42:55,239
Uh strawberry. Oh, well, this is your worst stream for next year

1253
02:42:56,440 --> 02:43:01,239
Oh, I see what you're doing. I didn't pre-watch. What are you talking about?

1254
02:43:01,879 --> 02:43:07,959
Holy shit. Wait, this just keep

1255
02:43:07,959 --> 02:43:16,829
Oh, there's banana. Okay. What'd you say? This is one

1256
02:43:17,149 --> 02:43:21,870
Remember, this is this is the first time i've seen you live. Is this what it's always like?

1257
02:43:21,950 --> 02:43:23,950
No, that's you you said what the last person said

1258
02:43:27,860 --> 02:43:30,440
Spoilers. All right. Let me take baby sensory out of the title

1259
02:43:31,739 --> 02:43:40,479
Because I when I all right, there's no more there's no more baby sensory. I'll give you 60 more seconds

1260
02:43:41,040 --> 02:43:59,920
Somebody said put on animal sensory like dogs cats birds. I don't I think the same shit's gonna happen

1261
02:44:04,170 --> 02:44:10,559
Just stand still and stare at the video. No, I mean we I about 7 000 people have already left

1262
02:44:11,399 --> 02:44:19,290
When baby sensory turned on so I don't want to get the rest of you gone

1263
02:44:21,950 --> 02:44:30,219
Okay, let me do this

1264
02:44:30,219 --> 02:44:32,219
the weakest 7 000

1265
02:44:35,049 --> 02:44:36,989
Do master chef

1266
02:44:36,989 --> 02:44:41,799
No, you've seen it a million times you've seen that a million times

1267
02:44:45,020 --> 02:44:49,709
So let me let me get this out of the way first if you came for the you laugh you lose

1268
02:44:50,959 --> 02:44:52,959
I've never done that before it was really fun

1269
02:44:53,959 --> 02:44:56,360
Uh, i'm gonna update this because there was at least a few more

1270
02:44:57,920 --> 02:45:01,069
so

1271
02:45:01,069 --> 02:45:02,809
That takes us to

1272
02:45:02,809 --> 02:45:05,209
3,500 dollars

1273
02:45:05,209 --> 02:45:16,489
This is not a beginner germa stream. Well, this is a react andy for three hours stream. I'm gonna i'll be left tomorrow though

1274
02:45:16,729 --> 02:45:22,040
This is not just a one stream here this week. I'll be left tomorrow

1275
02:45:23,450 --> 02:45:25,850
All right, so 3,500 dollars is going to go

1276
02:45:26,989 --> 02:45:30,829
Uh to the I think I want to send it to the that science center nevada

1277
02:45:35,040 --> 02:45:39,360
So I will be able to have uh, if you remember from the bugleberry hot tub stream

1278
02:45:40,299 --> 02:45:46,440
There was about I think 7 500 bucks came in so to science center nevada

1279
02:45:47,229 --> 02:45:50,040
That actually makes it perfect

1280
02:45:50,040 --> 02:45:57,719
Because that would be well, i'll just round it out. That'd be five. I was gonna do 5 000 to science center

1281
02:45:58,559 --> 02:46:00,319
So then plus 3,500

1282
02:46:00,319 --> 02:46:04,590
So here's what i'll here's what i'm gonna do i'm gonna send

1283
02:46:06,229 --> 02:46:11,610
$10,000 to the nevada science center to kind of make sure that was combined with the other one, too

1284
02:46:13,399 --> 02:46:16,440
So that is going to go to the their center

1285
02:46:18,110 --> 02:46:31,579
I'm really really can't wait to send that so it'll be 11k. Well, I was gonna round out from the bugleberry stuff

1286
02:46:31,979 --> 02:46:36,399
Somebody said i'm an oaf. I know it's your hardship, but

1287
02:46:36,959 --> 02:46:40,879
I want to can you fund my interest in yo-yos? Why did I read that comment?

1288
02:46:44,440 --> 02:46:50,270
Well, I had a good time I I knew this wasn't going to last very long and especially when baby sensory is like

1289
02:46:50,750 --> 02:47:04,329
That takes a turn off the road and I'm no not gonna have him. He's a philanthropist. Well, I here's the thing I promised

1290
02:47:05,049 --> 02:47:07,930
Back in like july or august or something

1291
02:47:08,489 --> 02:47:11,770
That um that money was actually going to get used and sent to these places

1292
02:47:11,770 --> 02:47:25,049
So want to get that in there? What if you did a yo-yo trick stop with the yo what's with the yo-yos?

1293
02:47:32,559 --> 02:47:39,340
All right, that's it. I'll see you guys tomorrow. I could pivot to monster rancher, but

1294
02:47:40,780 --> 02:47:44,809
I'd rather just do a whole day of it tomorrow because I think we're pretty much near the end

1295
02:47:46,959 --> 02:47:52,239
Let me let me let me type this so people know the final. So it'd be 35

1296
02:47:52,959 --> 02:48:06,510
No, no, you say yeah, you're right. So it'd be it'd be 11.5. It's dirt. Yeah, because I was gonna do five

1297
02:48:07,739 --> 02:48:13,180
And then oh, no, I'll split it. I'll send some to another place, too

1298
02:48:13,899 --> 02:48:15,659
I was gonna do one of the um

1299
02:48:15,659 --> 02:48:28,670
Humane societies out here. All right. There you go

1300
02:48:34,299 --> 02:48:37,340
Uh 10 000 bucks to the science center in nevada nevada science center

1301
02:48:38,090 --> 02:48:42,729
If you don't know who that is and you're wondering why uh, you might be if you're a new viewer or not

1302
02:48:43,520 --> 02:48:49,370
They helped out to do the geology archaeology stream and they were really really really nice people

1303
02:48:49,850 --> 02:49:03,129
So hopefully they can use it for something cool. Oh, I need an end and that'll wrap up today

1304
02:49:03,129 --> 02:49:05,100
I'll see you guys tomorrow

1305
02:49:05,100 --> 02:49:08,059
I'll do a full probably six plus hours of monster rancher tomorrow

1306
02:49:08,620 --> 02:49:11,579
And then what happened when we were adding no more monster rancher, what am I gonna do?

1307
02:49:13,100 --> 02:49:21,739
That's been my game for like two or three weeks. I have to find something else to do. I'm gonna go watch baby sensory

1308
02:49:25,610 --> 02:49:32,219
What you guys bet you guys bet earlier over or under 5 000. Oh man. Okay

1309
02:49:37,770 --> 02:49:42,190
Now have a great night. I'll see you guys tomorrow. There were a lot of gifted subs, too

1310
02:49:52,360 --> 02:49:58,030
I appreciate it. Thank you guys a lot. That was more fun than I will I

1311
02:49:58,590 --> 02:50:00,030
That was more fun than I thought

1312
02:50:00,030 --> 02:50:04,159
I think the next time I would want to do it

1313
02:50:04,159 --> 02:50:08,079
I would want to if if I was going to spend more than two three hours for doing that

1314
02:50:09,209 --> 02:50:12,090
Most of these compilations people kind of do it for like an hour, right?

1315
02:50:17,149 --> 02:50:26,270
All right. Yeah, hope you had a good time. I did have a wonderful rest of the night. Thanks everybody. See you tomorrow

1316
02:50:26,989 --> 02:50:37,159
Monster rancher two have a great night. Sorry. I screamed at you earlier, too. Just trying to scare you

1317
02:50:37,399 --> 02:50:46,090
I'll see you tomorrow put sensory on the credits

1318
02:50:48,139 --> 02:50:50,030
No

1319
02:50:50,030 --> 02:51:04,639
It wasn't actually scary. Yeah, I know I was messing around. I was just having fun. All right, go say hello to nianers

1320
02:51:08,280 --> 02:51:25,819

1321
02:51:31,479 --> 02:51:37,559
Okay. All right. What you doing?

1322
02:51:37,799 --> 02:51:41,680
Just chatting

1323
02:51:41,680 --> 02:51:46,989
Avoid baby sensory videos. I don't know what you're doing. Uh nianers 3d

1324
02:51:47,549 --> 02:51:49,790
