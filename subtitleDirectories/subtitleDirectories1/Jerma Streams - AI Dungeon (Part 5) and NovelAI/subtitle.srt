1
00:00:04,599 --> 00:00:09,359
Okay, I am back. Hello. How are you? Good to see you.

2
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:16,750
Yeah, before we get started before we like kind of continue though. I um, you know, I'm thinking about retiring.

3
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:20,250
No, I'm getting older. So I'm just thinking about. I'm thinking about retiring.

4
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:21,250
I'm thinking about retiring.

5
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:22,250
No, I'm getting older.

6
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:23,250
I'm thinking about retiring.

7
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:29,870
You know, I mean.

8
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:35,869
Oh shit, I have to gift subs. I can't though. I don't have it. My money won't go through to Twitch.

9
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:42,670
I didn't say how many I'll give you. I'll give you an extra ten. Okay, that'll be a hundred and ten.

10
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:49,600
I was making a joke. It's like I talk about this shit all the time and I'm just a fucking like, alright.

11
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,600
No, I'm not gonna talk about retiring anymore.

12
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,820
I'll give you ten. I'll give you ten.

13
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:59,820
I can't even fucking connect my Twitch to my fucking payment stuff.

14
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:03,539
Just real debt. Add it to the tab.

15
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:07,540
Alright, let's do AI dungeon. Isn't that gonna be fun guys?

16
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:09,969
Maybe I should get some music for this.

17
00:01:09,969 --> 00:01:12,530
Like epic royalty free music.

18
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:16,890
I don't know how it works, right?

19
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:28,219
Yeah, I'll get some epic royalty free music.

20
00:01:28,219 --> 00:01:34,829
Uh, royalty free scary.

21
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:41,849
Okay. This one sounds promising.

22
00:01:41,849 --> 00:01:43,849
One hour of royalty free horror music.

23
00:01:43,849 --> 00:01:48,010
Do a clash of clans.

24
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:51,010
Well, this is just to have the background sounds for when we do our adventure.

25
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:55,510
Epic royalty free music.

26
00:01:55,510 --> 00:02:02,719
This is uh, okay, this is called fire and thunder.

27
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:04,719
What does this one sound like?

28
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:09,879
I like it.

29
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:12,789
It's not bad.

30
00:02:16,789 --> 00:02:17,969
Okay.

31
00:02:17,969 --> 00:02:20,969
We need a, like, just generic general medieval music.

32
00:02:20,969 --> 00:02:31,650
Okay, this is um, fantasy medieval music, instrumental, no copyright.

33
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:38,069
Okay.

34
00:02:38,069 --> 00:02:41,419
Okay.

35
00:02:41,419 --> 00:02:45,729
So, apparently, AI dungeon is a lot different now, I guess.

36
00:02:45,729 --> 00:02:46,729
Right?

37
00:02:46,729 --> 00:02:56,900
I don't know exactly what that means, but I know that apparently it's been, it's changed.

38
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:09,439
Now, I don't know exactly what that means, but I'm gonna try to figure out what it means.

39
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:13,939
I have premium on AI dungeon, and I have premium on novel AI as well.

40
00:03:13,939 --> 00:03:17,780
I'm gonna do face cam finally.

41
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,780
I'll put it on for a few minutes.

42
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:29,039
Go ahead and do this.

43
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:31,439
Close that.

44
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:38,090
I need to put some lip balm on, though.

45
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:42,840
I gotta change the, uh, we aren't flipping, we are building.

46
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,840
I guess that could make sense in AI dungeon.

47
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:53,000
Okay.

48
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,500
Looks good.

49
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:06,569
Move this.

50
00:04:06,569 --> 00:04:08,569
I have, like, the Voyager thing.

51
00:04:08,569 --> 00:04:12,669
I don't think that really matters, though.

52
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:15,169
Okay, so this is, this is what I remember.

53
00:04:15,169 --> 00:04:21,610
Move the screen around for you.

54
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:27,389
Can you see it?

55
00:04:27,389 --> 00:04:28,389
Not yet.

56
00:04:28,389 --> 00:04:31,490
I got a clue.

57
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:32,490
Like, this is still open.

58
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:37,759
Okay.

59
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:41,730
Make sure you can see the chat window.

60
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:43,290
Important.

61
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:54,269
Make it a little bigger so you can read it better.

62
00:04:54,269 --> 00:05:01,220
So, what do we want to do?

63
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:02,220
Where do we want to go?

64
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:08,939
What setting do we want?

65
00:05:08,939 --> 00:05:11,699
Fantasy, mystery, apocalyptic.

66
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:23,810
We can make, just make up one on our own, too, right?

67
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:28,730
Where should I be?

68
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:31,230
Oh, I gotta turn my ring light on!

69
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:33,230
I can't be sitting here like this.

70
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:37,230
Oh, okay, let's do, let's do, uh, apocalyptic.

71
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:47,980
Oh, a nice warm light.

72
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:51,689
With a coffee.

73
00:05:51,689 --> 00:05:52,689
That's better.

74
00:05:52,689 --> 00:05:53,689
There.

75
00:05:53,689 --> 00:05:55,870
Although, why am I so frame-ready?

76
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:59,569
I'm too, like, I'm too, I look weird.

77
00:05:59,569 --> 00:06:00,569
Why?

78
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:08,810
Why does it, why do I look weird?

79
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:13,720
I look even weirder.

80
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:17,600
I'm, why is it so frame-ready?

81
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,670
You guys see what I'm talking about?

82
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:23,949
I shouldn't, there we go.

83
00:06:23,949 --> 00:06:24,949
That was weird.

84
00:06:24,949 --> 00:06:33,720
Now I don't look like I'm red.

85
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:39,089
Too much lip balm?

86
00:06:39,089 --> 00:06:44,879
Alright, you don't need to see the Reddit shelf anymore.

87
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:47,120
I look a little disheveled, don't I?

88
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,120
Alright.

89
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,860
Here we go.

90
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:54,800
So, what music should I have on?

91
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,800
I got my coffee right here!

92
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:04,269
I told you I was gonna make one.

93
00:07:04,269 --> 00:07:09,779
Ah, harsh noises.

94
00:07:09,779 --> 00:07:11,980
Where?

95
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:13,480
Alright, what should, let's go.

96
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,980
Uh, it's been a while.

97
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:16,980
Let's go ahead and do, let's do apocalyptic.

98
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:18,480
So, we'll do four.

99
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:21,300
Do I have to click it or just say it?

100
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,300
What do I do, nothing?

101
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:23,649
Okay.

102
00:07:23,649 --> 00:07:25,149
What character do I want to be?

103
00:07:25,149 --> 00:07:28,519
How about a, um, what character?

104
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:32,050
I don't know.

105
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:33,550
What would you guys want to see?

106
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:36,620
How about just, like, a survivor?

107
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:40,009
Survivor sounds good.

108
00:07:40,009 --> 00:07:41,009
Your character's name.

109
00:07:41,009 --> 00:07:42,509
Let's get some good music here.

110
00:07:42,509 --> 00:07:45,000
Gotta make sure this just sounds good.

111
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,300
This doesn't make much sense for where we are, but whatever.

112
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,540
I gotta make sure my voice changer works, too,

113
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:54,540
for, like, the monsters and demons and everything.

114
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:55,720
Hello.

115
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,720
Hello!

116
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,709
Oh, hello there, traveler.

117
00:07:59,709 --> 00:08:01,709
Yeah, okay, if that sounds okay.

118
00:08:01,709 --> 00:08:09,310
Ed, Edgwood.

119
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:11,189
Edgwood.

120
00:08:11,189 --> 00:08:14,990
Okay, here we go.

121
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:19,160
Ahem, ahem.

122
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,490
You...

123
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:23,990
Wait, this pictures now?

124
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:26,300
This is one of their photos.

125
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:31,319
Okay.

126
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:34,259
You are Edgwood.

127
00:08:34,259 --> 00:08:36,759
A survivor trying to survive in a post-apocalyptic world

128
00:08:36,759 --> 00:08:39,759
by scavenging among the ruins of what is left.

129
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:42,759
You have a backpack and a canteen.

130
00:08:42,759 --> 00:08:45,019
You haven't eaten in two days,

131
00:08:45,019 --> 00:08:47,519
so you're desperately searching for food.

132
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:50,019
You enter a run-down building and...

133
00:08:50,019 --> 00:08:53,519
find it occupied by a man and his two children.

134
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:57,019
They lit a fire in the fireplace to keep themselves warm.

135
00:08:57,019 --> 00:08:59,519
You can see a sack of potatoes on a shelf

136
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:02,519
and a closed tin of peaches in the fridge.

137
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:04,019
As you reach to grab the peaches,

138
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:06,019
you catch a glimpse of movement out of the corner of your eye.

139
00:09:06,019 --> 00:09:08,019
Don't move, the man says.

140
00:09:08,019 --> 00:09:11,220
Did I just, like, break into this person's house?

141
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:14,379
What happens now?

142
00:09:14,379 --> 00:09:17,379
Okay, so from what I remember, you have to, like...

143
00:09:17,379 --> 00:09:19,179
Do, okay.

144
00:09:19,179 --> 00:09:21,179
Do, what do you say, what happens next?

145
00:09:21,179 --> 00:09:22,679
So what do I do?

146
00:09:22,679 --> 00:09:32,330
Take the peaches out of the fridge.

147
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:36,100
Does that ma- Is that okay?

148
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:40,590
That's okay, right?

149
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:46,090
You take the peaches out of the fridge.

150
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:52,350
Training the AI, please tap on the response

151
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:54,850
you'd like to keep or hit undo.

152
00:09:54,850 --> 00:10:00,519
I've got the peaches, you say in a cheery tone.

153
00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:02,019
Oh, thank you, thank you so much.

154
00:10:02,019 --> 00:10:03,519
My wife and I have been eating those for two days

155
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,519
and she's got nothing left.

156
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:07,019
No worries, I'm just passing through.

157
00:10:07,019 --> 00:10:08,019
Don't try and stop me.

158
00:10:08,019 --> 00:10:09,519
There's a lot of zombies out there.

159
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:14,029
Or you quickly put the peaches back into the original sack.

160
00:10:14,029 --> 00:10:17,899
That done you turn to leave, the man is suddenly on you.

161
00:10:17,899 --> 00:10:19,899
Where'd you get those peaches, he asks.

162
00:10:19,899 --> 00:10:21,899
Why, are they gonna hurt me?

163
00:10:21,899 --> 00:10:24,269
No, but I'm going to.

164
00:10:24,269 --> 00:10:25,769
Keep them.

165
00:10:25,769 --> 00:10:28,269
The man then draws a gun and points it at you.

166
00:10:28,269 --> 00:10:31,980
We're gonna go with this one.

167
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:33,480
Why did I make this decision?

168
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,480
I don't know, it's, it's funnier?

169
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:43,409
Okay, the man draws a gun and points it at you.

170
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:55,799
I'm gonna say, you would shoot me in front of your children?

171
00:10:55,799 --> 00:11:00,220
You would shoot me in front of your children?

172
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:05,070
Turn that feature off, yeah, I will.

173
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:07,070
You would shoot me in front of your children?

174
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:16,710
I might, you wouldn't, try me.

175
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:18,210
Fine, I won't shoot you.

176
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:19,710
Good, now put the gun down.

177
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:21,710
He does so, you slowly approach him,

178
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:23,710
still not taking your eyes off of him.

179
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:25,710
You're only a few feet away now.

180
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:29,590
Keep a lookout, you whisper.

181
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:30,590
I know.

182
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:33,470
So the gun has legs.

183
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:38,330
Who is this person?

184
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:43,840
I grab the gun out of his hands.

185
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:54,200
Grab the gun out of his hands?

186
00:11:54,200 --> 00:12:08,769
You grab the gun out of his hands and turn to leave.

187
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:11,200
Where are you going, he asks.

188
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,509
I'm getting somewhere safe.

189
00:12:13,509 --> 00:12:17,250
But I thought you, oh, never mind, it doesn't matter.

190
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:20,750
He then picks up the gun again and points it at you.

191
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:22,750
I took it from him, that doesn't make any sense.

192
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:27,679
He got that from somewhere else.

193
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:33,220
Point my gun at him.

194
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:39,220
You point your gun at him.

195
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:45,240
Don't you shoot, he says.

196
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,240
I won't if you don't.

197
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,240
You're a good boy.

198
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,240
You'll get your fill of good food and nice warm beds.

199
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,600
I hope so.

200
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,600
Now get out of here.

201
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,600
I've got a business to run after this is all over.

202
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,600
Bye.

203
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:04,669
Shoot into the ceiling.

204
00:13:04,669 --> 00:13:13,600
You shoot the man in the head with your gun.

205
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,600
He slumps down.

206
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:18,600
You quickly look around and make sure his children have not seen you or heard this.

207
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,600
They haven't.

208
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,600
You then leave the room.

209
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,840
You exit the rundown building and find yourself in a street full of overturned vehicles and debris.

210
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:29,840
You see the man with the two children coming down the street.

211
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:38,360
Um, I wanted to like be like, boom, like, see you later.

212
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:50,879
I'm not pointing my gun.

213
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:55,879
Exit the rundown building and find yourself in a street full of overturned vehicles and debris.

214
00:13:55,879 --> 00:13:59,360
What should I do?

215
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,820
This is a post-apocalyptic.

216
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:08,159
Okay.

217
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:10,159
Run towards the zombies.

218
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:14,320
I'll lose him in the zombies.

219
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:20,139
You run towards the zombies as fast as you can.

220
00:14:20,139 --> 00:14:23,139
You are worried about being seen by the man with the gun.

221
00:14:23,139 --> 00:14:26,139
You're also worried about the safety of the peaches.

222
00:14:26,139 --> 00:14:28,139
Because, heaven forbid, something happens to those.

223
00:14:28,139 --> 00:14:33,379
You continue moving towards the zombies when the man with the gun fires and the bullet hits the zombie in the chest.

224
00:14:33,379 --> 00:14:37,379
You hear a satisfying crack as the zombie collapses to the ground.

225
00:14:37,379 --> 00:14:38,379
You keep running.

226
00:14:38,379 --> 00:14:44,929
Protect the peaches.

227
00:14:44,929 --> 00:14:48,639
You protect the peaches.

228
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:53,870
You grab the peaches and tuck them into your bag.

229
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:56,870
Don't shoot, you yell, as you continue running towards the man.

230
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:57,870
No, I want to run that way.

231
00:14:57,870 --> 00:14:58,870
I didn't shoot.

232
00:14:58,870 --> 00:14:59,870
I didn't shoot.

233
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:00,870
The gun went off by itself.

234
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:04,169
I was just reaching for the bullets to stop the bleeding.

235
00:15:04,169 --> 00:15:05,169
Shut up, you say as you run.

236
00:15:05,169 --> 00:15:06,169
You need to get off the street.

237
00:15:06,169 --> 00:15:18,399
This is stupid.

238
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:21,529
Eat the peaches in front of the man.

239
00:15:21,529 --> 00:15:27,460
This AI imaging is just so fucked up.

240
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:30,460
You bite into a peach and you find yourself in a world of flavor and sunshine.

241
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:33,889
You smile from ear to ear.

242
00:15:33,889 --> 00:15:36,889
You should have shot the bastards, the man says as he picks up another peach.

243
00:15:36,889 --> 00:15:38,889
I can't shoot straight, you say.

244
00:15:38,889 --> 00:15:40,889
That's what you get for eating garbage, he says.

245
00:15:40,889 --> 00:15:42,889
What the fuck is happening in this story?

246
00:15:42,889 --> 00:15:48,080
I'll say.

247
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:53,340
Do you want to join forces?

248
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:57,279
We could work together.

249
00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:00,590
Fight zombies.

250
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:08,009
Ashley is pretty accurate though.

251
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:13,129
We weren't supposed to talk to each other, he says.

252
00:16:13,129 --> 00:16:15,129
We are not supposed to be here in the first place, you yell.

253
00:16:15,129 --> 00:16:16,129
You're right.

254
00:16:16,129 --> 00:16:17,129
Let's work together.

255
00:16:17,129 --> 00:16:18,129
You decide to work together.

256
00:16:18,129 --> 00:16:20,129
The man pulls out a canteen of water and gives you some.

257
00:16:20,129 --> 00:16:27,879
Break the entire canteen.

258
00:16:27,879 --> 00:16:31,779
Please verify your email address.

259
00:16:31,779 --> 00:16:34,559
What?

260
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:38,440
What do you mean verify my, I already did all this.

261
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:44,679
I already verified my email.

262
00:16:44,679 --> 00:16:52,759
Hold on.

263
00:16:52,759 --> 00:16:55,759
What do you mean, verify my email address?

264
00:16:55,759 --> 00:17:06,000
That's part of the story?

265
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,170
Try the other one.

266
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:09,170
Should I try novel AI instead?

267
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:18,410
I already did verify my email, that's fucked up.

268
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:19,410
I'll try the other one.

269
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:22,609
Is it that much different?

270
00:17:22,609 --> 00:17:30,150
Okay, text adventure.

271
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:31,150
Should I do this one?

272
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:32,150
Which one should I do?

273
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:36,349
Tall streamer at hotmail.

274
00:17:36,349 --> 00:17:44,720
All right, I'll do text adventure.

275
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,720
All right, what do you, let's just, I guess we can just do this one.

276
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:56,279
AI dungeon lost the rights to use open AI so they had to make a new AI and it's just not as good as that.

277
00:17:56,279 --> 00:17:57,279
Really?

278
00:17:57,279 --> 00:17:59,839
Well, I got a change that says I'm playing.

279
00:17:59,839 --> 00:18:08,359
Does it have a thing on Twitch?

280
00:18:08,359 --> 00:18:10,359
It does, okay.

281
00:18:10,359 --> 00:18:12,559
Okay.

282
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:17,869
Well, we'll just do this one.

283
00:18:17,869 --> 00:18:20,869
There's other stuff on that AI dungeon website though that looked interesting.

284
00:18:20,869 --> 00:18:23,809
Okay, so let's get started here.

285
00:18:23,809 --> 00:18:26,369
All right, new track.

286
00:18:26,369 --> 00:18:31,619
What would you like to do?

287
00:18:31,619 --> 00:18:32,619
Story.

288
00:18:32,619 --> 00:18:34,240
Okay, let's start a story.

289
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:40,000
You are lost in the woods.

290
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:49,859
Your name is, you are lost in the woods.

291
00:18:49,859 --> 00:18:57,799
Your name is Edward III.

292
00:18:57,799 --> 00:19:07,160
Your father is Edward the Great.

293
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:22,150
And he has sent you into the woods to claim a relic that has been lost for over 200 centuries.

294
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:24,150
Is that long?

295
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:25,900
Edgeworth?

296
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:28,420
What's Edgeworth?

297
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:29,420
Edward.

298
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:31,660
This is a run-on sentence.

299
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:33,660
The AI doesn't care about run-on sentences.

300
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:42,700
You have a rusty knife and a trusty sword.

301
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:45,859
Begin.

302
00:19:45,859 --> 00:19:52,430
As you walk deeper into the woods, you see an old man sitting on a rock.

303
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:53,430
He looks like he's sleeping.

304
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:55,430
You approach him cautiously.

305
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:58,430
But as you get closer, he suddenly sits up, staring at you with bloodshot eyes.

306
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:00,430
That's 20,000 years.

307
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:13,319
Are you serious?

308
00:20:13,319 --> 00:20:17,049
Say.

309
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:27,609
Dear old man, I'm looking for a relic that has been lost time.

310
00:20:27,609 --> 00:20:37,440
Dear old man, I'm looking for a relic that's been lost time.

311
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,440
The old man laughs.

312
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,440
That's exactly what I am.

313
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:47,440
I am the relic master of the forest, and I know every relic in this forest by heart.

314
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,759
What do you want from me?

315
00:20:50,759 --> 00:20:55,839
Holy shit.

316
00:20:55,839 --> 00:21:04,480
Do you know where the heart of Edward is?

317
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:14,279
He laughs again.

318
00:21:14,279 --> 00:21:16,279
Of course I do.

319
00:21:16,279 --> 00:21:18,279
It's right here in my pocket.

320
00:21:18,279 --> 00:21:20,279
But before you can grab it, he vanishes.

321
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,710
You're standing near a dead tree.

322
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:32,440
There's a large hole in the ground nearby and a wooden stake sticking out of the ground.

323
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,440
I shouldn't have said that.

324
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:40,089
Lie down in the hole.

325
00:21:40,089 --> 00:21:43,869
On my back.

326
00:21:43,869 --> 00:21:51,680
A moment later, you hear a strange sound coming from below you.

327
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:54,680
As you look down, you see the old man sitting on the ground, smiling at you.

328
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,680
Hello there, he says.

329
00:21:56,680 --> 00:22:02,819
Wait, am I on top of him?

330
00:22:02,819 --> 00:22:11,720
He's lying down on the ground too?

331
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:14,720
Wildcard, type only a question mark to ask and wonder.

332
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,720
Okay, that's...

333
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,789
Where did you go?

334
00:22:17,789 --> 00:22:20,410
How did you disappear so quickly?

335
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:23,410
Oh, that was just a little trick I learned when I was young.

336
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:27,680
I can disappear and appear at will.

337
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:34,869
Can you teach me, old man?

338
00:22:34,869 --> 00:22:35,869
Sure, he says.

339
00:22:35,869 --> 00:22:38,430
Come on down and we'll have some fun.

340
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:41,430
You descend into the hole, which seems to be a small cave.

341
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:46,420
The old man follows you in.

342
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:54,569
I gotta be very cautious.

343
00:22:54,569 --> 00:23:07,630
Keep my hands on my knife, on my sword, while we walk into the cave.

344
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:11,630
As soon as you enter the cave, the old man grabs his pocket watch and starts ticking loudly.

345
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:14,869
Suddenly a huge creature bursts...

346
00:23:14,869 --> 00:23:17,869
Suddenly a huge creature bursts out of the ground behind you.

347
00:23:17,869 --> 00:23:19,869
It looks like a cross between a bull and a bear.

348
00:23:19,869 --> 00:23:25,910
Watch out!

349
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:29,170
It turns around and sees the old man.

350
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:32,480
It snarls and charges at him.

351
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:40,529
The old man jumps out of the way just in time and the creature falls on its side, stunned.

352
00:23:40,529 --> 00:23:42,599
Kill it!

353
00:23:42,599 --> 00:23:45,599
You leap forward and swing your sword at the beast, cutting off one of its legs.

354
00:23:45,599 --> 00:23:47,599
It howls in pain and lunges at you.

355
00:23:47,599 --> 00:23:51,779
You dodge the attack and stab it in the eye with your sword.

356
00:23:51,779 --> 00:24:05,369
Old man!

357
00:24:05,369 --> 00:24:07,680
Grab me the holy water from my backpack!

358
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:12,490
You run back towards the old man who is still holding the pocket watch in his hand.

359
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:14,490
He takes it out of his pocket and flicks it open.

360
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:17,799
Suddenly he screams and drops the watch.

361
00:24:17,799 --> 00:24:24,200
Pick up the watch.

362
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:27,589
You pick up the watch.

363
00:24:27,589 --> 00:24:31,589
The watch is cracked and covered in dirt, but inside you can see a tiny fragment of white bone.

364
00:24:31,589 --> 00:24:35,759
You take the watch out of the pocket and put it back in your bag.

365
00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:41,559
What does this watch do?

366
00:24:41,559 --> 00:24:45,720
Nothing special, the old man says.

367
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:46,720
Just a good luck charm.

368
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,720
You leave the cave and head deeper into the woods.

369
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:52,720
You are now in the clearing where you found the relic.

370
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:56,200
Okay.

371
00:24:56,200 --> 00:25:01,450
Why did he scream?

372
00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:11,279
Why did you scream after opening the pocket of the watch?

373
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:16,829
Oh, that's just something that happens sometimes, the old man says.

374
00:25:16,829 --> 00:25:17,829
It's not important.

375
00:25:17,829 --> 00:25:19,829
Just don't open it again, okay?

376
00:25:19,829 --> 00:25:27,660
You are standing in a clearing to the west of the small hill.

377
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:33,630
If I open this pocket watch, what will happen?

378
00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:39,130
Don't open it again.

379
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:42,130
And make sure you never tell anybody about this place.

380
00:25:42,130 --> 00:25:45,130
You reach into your bag and pull out a small metal box.

381
00:25:45,130 --> 00:25:47,130
It is engraved with strange symbols.

382
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:54,319
Open the pocket watch.

383
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:57,589
Suddenly the old man disappears.

384
00:25:57,589 --> 00:26:00,589
You feel yourself falling through the air and then everything goes black.

385
00:26:00,589 --> 00:26:04,660
You are lying on the ground with the old man kneeling beside you.

386
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:06,900
He's holding a flask of water.

387
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:13,390
Where are we?

388
00:26:13,390 --> 00:26:19,019
We're in the forest, he replies.

389
00:26:19,019 --> 00:26:23,019
I had to bring you here because I couldn't find any other way to contact you.

390
00:26:23,019 --> 00:26:25,650
Why?

391
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:38,059
Because if anyone else finds out about this place, they might try to come here.

392
00:26:38,059 --> 00:26:39,059
How nice is it?

393
00:26:39,059 --> 00:26:40,059
It's a time machine.

394
00:26:40,059 --> 00:26:47,109
What year is it?

395
00:26:47,109 --> 00:26:50,109
It's 1827, he replies.

396
00:26:50,109 --> 00:26:52,670
How long have I been unconscious?

397
00:26:52,670 --> 00:26:53,670
About two weeks.

398
00:26:53,670 --> 00:26:55,480
You sit up.

399
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,480
Thank you for saving me, old man.

400
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:04,529
Open the pocket watch.

401
00:27:04,529 --> 00:27:05,529
This might be the relic.

402
00:27:05,529 --> 00:27:06,529
This is the relic.

403
00:27:06,529 --> 00:27:11,079
The old man screams and drops the watch.

404
00:27:11,079 --> 00:27:13,079
You open the watch and see a piece of white bone.

405
00:27:13,079 --> 00:27:17,769
You close the watch and put it back in your bag.

406
00:27:17,769 --> 00:27:29,549
You stand up and walk over to the old man.

407
00:27:29,549 --> 00:27:30,549
Am I in the cave?

408
00:27:30,549 --> 00:27:39,789
Is that the relic?

409
00:27:39,789 --> 00:27:41,799
Yes, he says.

410
00:27:41,799 --> 00:27:43,799
That is the relic.

411
00:27:43,799 --> 00:27:47,380
You take the relic from him and put it in your bag.

412
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:48,380
Now let's get out of here.

413
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:54,380
So that's the heart of Edward's heart.

414
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:55,380
That's the heart of Edward.

415
00:27:55,380 --> 00:28:00,839
They leave it.

416
00:28:00,839 --> 00:28:04,500
Heart?

417
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:08,940
Edward is in my hands.

418
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:11,630
Father will be most pleased.

419
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:21,759
No!

420
00:28:21,759 --> 00:28:22,759
The old man shouts.

421
00:28:22,759 --> 00:28:23,759
This is evil.

422
00:28:23,759 --> 00:28:25,519
We must destroy it.

423
00:28:25,519 --> 00:28:26,519
But why?

424
00:28:26,519 --> 00:28:28,519
I've been searching for this for years.

425
00:28:28,519 --> 00:28:29,519
Because it's evil.

426
00:28:29,519 --> 00:28:33,289
What makes it evil?

427
00:28:33,289 --> 00:28:37,839
It's cursed.

428
00:28:37,839 --> 00:28:38,839
He replies.

429
00:28:38,839 --> 00:28:41,839
If you open it, it will take away all of your memories.

430
00:28:41,839 --> 00:28:43,839
And then you won't remember anything.

431
00:28:43,839 --> 00:28:45,839
You hold the relic in both hands.

432
00:28:45,839 --> 00:28:58,599
Open it.

433
00:28:58,599 --> 00:29:02,690
Suddenly you are standing in a dark room.

434
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:04,690
You are holding a glowing blue orb.

435
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:08,690
You look around the room and notice that the walls are covered in strange writing.

436
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:09,690
You read.

437
00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:16,380
The first man, Adam, created in the image of God, was alone in the Garden of Eden.

438
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:21,460
Keep reading.

439
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:33,329
Until Eve, the second woman, was brought forth from his rib, Adam gave her to his son Cain.

440
00:29:33,329 --> 00:29:36,329
Adam gave her to his son Cain as a wife?

441
00:29:36,329 --> 00:29:39,329
Cain slew his brother Abel and fled from the Garden of Eden.

442
00:29:39,329 --> 00:29:50,910
Then Enoch, the third man, walked with God and was taken up to heaven without dying.

443
00:29:50,910 --> 00:29:55,079
Enoch returned to earth and told his people that the world would end.

444
00:29:55,079 --> 00:30:04,799
After many years, the Great Flood destroyed the world and Noah built an ark to save his

445
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:06,799
family from the waters.

446
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:10,799
The ark floated for 40 days and nights until it reached dry land.

447
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:12,170
Keep reading.

448
00:30:12,170 --> 00:30:17,500
The ark landed on Mount Ararat in Turkey.

449
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:21,500
God commanded Noah to build a tower to reach heaven.

450
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:28,500
Noah obeyed and constructed the Tower of Babel, the first human structure ever made.

451
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:34,450
Is this all real?

452
00:30:34,450 --> 00:30:36,450
Does this happen?

453
00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:37,950
Keep reading.

454
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:48,900
But Satan, the god of this world, the hunters, were becoming too powerful and tried to destroy

455
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:49,900
them.

456
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:53,900
So he caused them to speak different languages, and they began to fight amongst themselves.

457
00:30:53,900 --> 00:31:00,210
Keep reading.

458
00:31:00,210 --> 00:31:04,210
God scattered the humans and scattered their language.

459
00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:09,210
When Moses led the Hebrew slaves out of Egypt, he was given the Ten Commandments.

460
00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:20,160
Moses returned to Israel and built the Tabernacle, the first temple in Jerusalem.

461
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:26,509
King Solomon built the first temple, and the Ark of the Covenant was placed in it.

462
00:31:26,509 --> 00:31:31,509
Solomon also built the second temple, which stood until the Romans destroyed it in 70a.

463
00:31:31,509 --> 00:31:45,049
I wonder where Satan was at this point.

464
00:31:45,049 --> 00:31:53,390
Satan was banished from heaven and cast down to hell.

465
00:31:53,390 --> 00:31:58,390
In the last days, Satan will return to earth, and the Antichrist will reign over the world.

466
00:31:58,390 --> 00:32:02,400
The Bible is a book of prophecy.

467
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:06,710
Keep reading.

468
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:09,710
The Antichrist will be a false prophet who will rise to power in the Middle East.

469
00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:12,710
His name is Muhammad, and he will rule the world.

470
00:32:12,710 --> 00:32:16,710
At the end of his reign, Jesus Christ will return to earth and defeat the Antichrist.

471
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:17,710
What?

472
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:20,009
What the fuck are you talking about?

473
00:32:20,009 --> 00:32:24,519
What?

474
00:32:24,519 --> 00:32:32,529
Jesus will establish his kingdom on earth and rule as king of kings for a thousand years.

475
00:32:32,529 --> 00:32:35,529
After that, Satan will be released from prison and tempt...

476
00:32:35,529 --> 00:32:37,529
What is happening here?

477
00:32:37,529 --> 00:32:46,660
Say, this doesn't sound accurate.

478
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:51,329
It is true that the Antichrist will rise.

479
00:32:51,329 --> 00:32:53,329
He will be defeated by Jesus.

480
00:32:53,329 --> 00:32:56,329
Also, the Antichrist will not be the only false prophet.

481
00:32:56,329 --> 00:32:57,329
There will be others.

482
00:32:57,329 --> 00:33:02,400
I don't think this is what happened.

483
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:06,559
Who is talking right now?

484
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:13,730
It's me, the old man says.

485
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:15,730
I'm telling you what happened.

486
00:33:15,730 --> 00:33:17,910
You continue reading.

487
00:33:17,910 --> 00:33:27,289
Aren't I reading this off of a wall?

488
00:33:27,289 --> 00:33:34,039
After the a thousand years are up, Satan will be released from his prison and will deceive mankind once more.

489
00:33:34,039 --> 00:33:45,160
Keep reading.

490
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:49,750
No, I don't want him to keep reading.

491
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:52,750
I'm telling him to keep reading.

492
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:54,750
Hey, I'll go. Keep reading.

493
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:58,990
This time, he will be able to use the powers of a fallen angel called the Beast.

494
00:33:58,990 --> 00:34:02,990
The Beast will rule the world for seven years before being defeated by Jesus.

495
00:34:02,990 --> 00:34:11,130
When Satan is imprisoned again, the devil will be chained for a thousand years.

496
00:34:11,130 --> 00:34:12,130
Is Thor in this?

497
00:34:12,130 --> 00:34:14,440
Yes, the old man says.

498
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:17,440
He is mentioned several times in the Bible.

499
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,440
You continue reading.

500
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:26,739
At the end of the millennium, Satan will be loosed once more and will tempt mankind to rebel against God.

501
00:34:26,739 --> 00:34:30,739
Can you skip to the part with Elmo?

502
00:34:30,739 --> 00:34:37,500
No, the old man says. There isn't much left.

503
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:41,929
During the rebellion, the Antichrist will be killed by the archangel Michael.

504
00:34:41,929 --> 00:34:47,300
Michael will be rewarded for his bravery and become the leader of the angels.

505
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:50,480
Is Elmo in this?

506
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:57,340
No, the old man says. He does not appear in the Bible at all.

507
00:34:57,340 --> 00:34:59,340
Oh, okay. Phew.

508
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:07,699
Elmo is not in the Bible.

509
00:35:07,699 --> 00:35:09,699
What about Kermit the Frog?

510
00:35:09,699 --> 00:35:15,760
Kermit the Frog is not mentioned in the Bible.

511
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,760
You continue reading.

512
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:28,449
Okay, please, please finish the story.

513
00:35:28,449 --> 00:35:31,449
After that, Satan will be chained for a thousand years.

514
00:35:31,449 --> 00:35:32,449
Alright, he's stuck.

515
00:35:32,449 --> 00:35:37,650
Grab the book out of his hands.

516
00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:42,809
I am finished, the old man says. You can stop reading now.

517
00:35:42,809 --> 00:35:45,989
You take the book out of his hands and put it back in your bag.

518
00:35:45,989 --> 00:35:47,989
Wait, what about Elmo?

519
00:35:47,989 --> 00:36:03,579
You're now standing in the clearing where you found the relic.

520
00:36:03,579 --> 00:36:06,820
You're standing in the clearing where you found the relic. To the west is a small hill.

521
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:10,820
To the east is a path leading north into the forest.

522
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:25,039
Okay.

523
00:36:25,039 --> 00:36:27,039
Yell, where is Elmo?

524
00:36:27,039 --> 00:36:28,659
My god.

525
00:36:28,659 --> 00:36:33,079
You shout, where is Elmo?

526
00:36:33,079 --> 00:36:36,079
Suddenly, the old man appears.

527
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:38,079
Where is Elmo, you ask?

528
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:40,079
He's gone. I sent him away.

529
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:43,079
You reach into your bag and pull out the pocket watch.

530
00:36:43,079 --> 00:36:52,840
Fuck this Elmo-less timeline.

531
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:58,539
I'm out of here.

532
00:36:58,539 --> 00:37:01,539
Suddenly, you're standing in a dark room. You're holding a glowing blue orb.

533
00:37:01,539 --> 00:37:04,719
You look around the room and notice that the walls are covered in strange writing.

534
00:37:04,719 --> 00:37:05,719
You read.

535
00:37:05,719 --> 00:37:09,889
The first man, Adam, created in the image of God, was alone in the Garden of Eden.

536
00:37:09,889 --> 00:37:16,440
Read the part about Elmo.

537
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:21,340
Until Eve. Come on.

538
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:25,639
You can't give me like, Elmo is like Eve or something.

539
00:37:25,639 --> 00:37:27,639
The book of Elmo.

540
00:37:27,639 --> 00:37:33,110
Run out of the cave.

541
00:37:33,110 --> 00:37:35,349
You run out of the cave.

542
00:37:35,349 --> 00:37:37,349
You're now standing in the clearing where you found the relic.

543
00:37:37,349 --> 00:37:38,719
To the west is a small hill.

544
00:37:38,719 --> 00:37:41,719
Head towards the hill.

545
00:37:41,719 --> 00:37:46,880
You climb the hill and are standing at the top.

546
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:49,880
To the north is a path leading south into the forest.

547
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:57,920
To the east is a path leading south into the forest.

548
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:00,920
To the east is a path leading north into the forest.

549
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:04,920
And to the west is a path leading north into the forest.

550
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:08,880
Ask the old man where to go.

551
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:16,960
We need to find the relic. It is buried under the hill.

552
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:19,650
You ask the old man where to go.

553
00:38:19,650 --> 00:38:23,110
We need to find the relic.

554
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:24,110
We've time traveled.

555
00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:27,820
Explain to the old man.

556
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:31,239
How do I say this?

557
00:38:31,239 --> 00:38:39,210
Explain to the old man. You explain to the old man time travel.

558
00:38:39,210 --> 00:38:42,280
Time travel is impossible, he says.

559
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:44,280
Only God can do that.

560
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:56,110
That makes me God then.

561
00:38:56,110 --> 00:38:57,110
That makes you God?

562
00:38:57,110 --> 00:39:02,059
You ask the old man where to go.

563
00:39:02,059 --> 00:39:05,059
We need to find the relic. It's buried under the hill.

564
00:39:05,059 --> 00:39:07,360
That makes me God then, you reply.

565
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:12,059
Why?

566
00:39:12,059 --> 00:39:18,440
Because I am the one who sent you back in time, he says.

567
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:21,539
We need to find the relic.

568
00:39:21,539 --> 00:39:29,369
We're combining like three or four realities.

569
00:39:29,369 --> 00:39:32,610
Dig under the hill for the relic.

570
00:39:32,610 --> 00:39:34,610
Are we gonna find two of them?

571
00:39:34,610 --> 00:39:37,750
You dig under the hill for the relic.

572
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:38,989
We need to find the relic.

573
00:39:38,989 --> 00:39:40,230
Find the relic.

574
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:41,230
We're in a loop.

575
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:43,230
You find the relic.

576
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:46,170
We need to find the relic.

577
00:39:46,170 --> 00:39:47,170
We need to find the relic.

578
00:39:47,170 --> 00:39:51,079
Start shaking the old man.

579
00:39:51,079 --> 00:39:54,210
You start shaking the old man.

580
00:39:54,210 --> 00:39:56,900
We need to find the relic!

581
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:16,239
Break, smash the relic.

582
00:40:16,239 --> 00:40:36,059
You smashed the relic with a hammer.

583
00:40:36,059 --> 00:40:58,650
slap him it's over we're stuck in an infinite loop now the old man snaps out of it both venture

shouting blood i'm shouting the blood and pointing at me finally i gave up and accepted my fate

778
01:22:04,569 --> 01:22:08,140
a few days later i got a letter from mr fitz thanking me for helping him he said that he was

779
01:22:08,140 --> 01:22:11,579
grateful for my assistance and he was going to give me a raise and a promotion

780
01:22:18,729 --> 01:22:29,340
i said thank you but could not understand what no i said i said let me see how do i get this i said

781
01:22:29,340 --> 01:22:36,670
thank you but he defined the relic the same development he said where does the killing come

782
01:22:36,670 --> 01:22:56,430
in i declined and decided quit on the spot when i told my neighbor mr fitz he told me that i was

783
01:22:56,430 --> 01:23:00,350
crazy for losing such a great job and that i should have done everything i could to save it

784
01:23:00,909 --> 01:23:05,369
but i knew that i couldn't risk losing my job because if there's something i did accidentally

785
01:23:06,520 --> 01:23:17,079
so here i am unemployed and eating toast mr fitz walks into the midnight sun and i see him sitting

875
01:44:22,029 --> 01:44:40,699
all directly into his mouth bread crumbs yeah bread crumbs what are they doing in my mouth

876
01:44:41,579 --> 01:45:51,130
i put them there why because i wanted to see if you would eat them uh mr fitz sinks his teeth into

877
01:45:51,130 --> 01:45:59,630
my neck but there is no blood only wait no even no blood only garlic flavor see when one eats

878
01:45:59,630 --> 01:46:04,270
garlic toast every day seems to come in handy against vampires what an awful sentence

879
01:46:04,989 --> 01:46:13,359
it tastes like garlic mr fitz says yeah i know why because i eat garlic every day

880
01:46:13,920 --> 01:46:51,579
really yes really what happened happened happened his eyes lock mine we both stare

881
01:46:51,579 --> 01:47:01,279
into each other's very soul he realizes what has happened he will now die from garlic vampire

882
01:47:02,159 --> 01:47:13,520
he tries to escape but i grab him and bite him in the neck he screams in pain

883
01:47:15,420 --> 01:47:28,560
stop what's wrong you're not a vampire anymore see the amount of garlic i eat i actually

884
01:47:29,279 --> 01:47:50,520
can reverse vampirism oh by drinking your blood you mean i'll live yes i'll save your life i'll

885
01:47:50,520 --> 01:47:58,640
pull up my knife and stab him in his stomach what i hold the knife in place and then start to cut his

886
01:47:58,640 --> 01:48:10,279
stomach open i remove his intestines and throw them into a garbage can i take out his liver

887
01:48:10,279 --> 01:48:17,310
and slice it up into pieces what the fuck i then take his heart and throw it into the trash can

888
01:48:17,310 --> 01:48:25,310
with the rest of the organs i take a deep breath and inhale the blood that is in the garbage can

889
01:48:25,310 --> 01:48:34,239
it tastes horrible but it works i feel alive again wow that was gross yeah it was

890
01:48:35,279 --> 01:48:39,520
do you know how long it took me to get this organ back inside of you no i don't

891
01:48:42,939 --> 01:48:47,899
about two weeks two weeks yes it was that bad i pull up my knife and cut off his head

892
01:48:48,619 --> 01:48:56,829
i put it in the garbage can next to his body you're a murderer i'm sorry why did you do that because

893
01:48:56,829 --> 01:49:18,250
you tried to kill me no i didn't yes you did no i didn't yes you did this is the most realistic

894
01:49:18,250 --> 01:49:25,449
vr experience i've ever seen i agree can i use this to make a game of course thank you

895
01:49:28,319 --> 01:49:32,640
exit the booth and walk back to the office what did you guys think of the demo i asked

896
01:49:33,579 --> 01:49:41,770
it was amazing did you enjoy it i loved it good good now if you excuse me i have a meeting with

897
01:49:41,770 --> 01:49:53,390
the investors okay bye i walk up to my desk and sit down my phone rings i answer the phone hey

898
01:49:53,390 --> 01:49:58,350
it's me hi it's mark listen i got a call for i just got a call from an investor he wants to

899
01:49:58,350 --> 01:50:05,359
talk about the game okay okay i'll be right there i hang up the phone and look at the clock

900
01:50:05,359 --> 01:50:08,319
it's already three p.m i rush out of the office and head over to the meeting

901
01:50:11,720 --> 01:50:15,560
i arrive at the investor's office and knock on the door the investor answers the door and invites me

902
01:50:15,560 --> 01:50:22,989
in hello mark how are you i'm great thanks for having me today i'm glad you could make it i'm

903
01:50:22,989 --> 01:50:27,470
sorry i'm late it's okay i wasn't expecting you until four p.m we sit down in the conference room

904
01:50:27,470 --> 01:50:35,630
and wait for the investor to finish talking to someone on the phone he hangs up very upset

905
01:50:36,109 --> 01:50:53,840
it seems the investors do not think vampire chef vr will sell more than

906
01:50:54,479 --> 01:51:07,600
eight copies i'm sorry but i don't think we should invest any money into this project

907
01:51:08,319 --> 01:51:23,319
why not that's too risky what do you mean pulls out a graph resident sleeper this is a chart of

908
01:51:23,319 --> 01:51:30,520
all the games that have sold for over one million copies so see vampire chef vr has only sold

909
01:51:30,520 --> 01:51:49,739
7500 copies that is not enough for us to invest any more than we already have 7500 copies that's

910
01:51:49,739 --> 01:51:54,460
it yes that's all i look at the graph and notice that all the other games on the list have sold

911
01:51:54,460 --> 01:52:08,189
hundreds of thousands of copies why well it's simple most people don't like vampires and

912
01:52:08,189 --> 01:52:17,920
fact i bet most of those who bought the game are children children but i'm 14 years old wait what

913
01:52:21,210 --> 01:52:27,529
14 year olds don't buy games they play them on their phones and computers i don't understand

914
01:52:27,529 --> 01:52:41,930
i'm sorry but you don't have the right demographic what if we made it a mobile game took out the

915
01:52:41,930 --> 01:52:53,500
blood and replaced it with a match three match three game where you periodically

916
01:52:54,460 --> 01:53:17,239
clean up a house or a garden with points from the match three game we could lose the vr experience

917
01:53:18,119 --> 01:53:30,680
what if we kept the vr experience but made it a different game a different game you know but

918
01:53:30,680 --> 01:53:36,250
that wouldn't be a vr game yes it would you would still be using vr you would just be playing on a

919
01:53:36,250 --> 01:53:58,090
different screen i don't know you could hold up two copies of the game in front of each eye it's

920
01:53:58,090 --> 01:54:11,020
the same no it isn't yes it is no it isn't yes it is no it's not yes it is i don't know i just

921
01:54:11,020 --> 01:54:14,220
don't think it would work well we'll see if you're interested give me a call tomorrow morning all

922
01:54:14,220 --> 01:54:31,880
right thanks lunch forward and bite his neck he falls to the floor and i take his heart and throw

923
01:54:31,880 --> 01:54:37,479
it into the trash can i take a deep breath and then exhale i turn around and see the investor

924
01:54:37,479 --> 01:54:51,850
staring at me who did i do this to who did i do that too i just saw you bite his neck and then

926
01:54:56,539 --> 01:55:08,779
to me i leave the office head home and walk into my apartment and sit down on the couch

927
01:55:08,779 --> 01:55:12,460
i look at my computer and realize i need to do some work i take out my laptop and plug it into

928
01:55:12,460 --> 01:55:24,170

so i can tell everyone about them i've been watching a lot of different shows and getting

942
01:57:57,149 --> 01:58:11,199
ideas from them both back i enter the arena and see a dozen chefs all standing with their arms

943
01:58:11,760 --> 01:58:24,750
behind their backs and wearing the same branded aprons there are cameras everywhere and a few

944
01:58:24,750 --> 01:58:29,470
people who look like production assistants stand nearby i'm feeling very nervous but also excited

945
01:58:29,470 --> 01:58:33,869
this could be my chance to become famous i walk into the kitchen and immediately fall feel out

946
01:58:33,869 --> 01:58:41,239
of place i bite their necks okay i walk in the kitchen immediately but i place

947
01:58:42,279 --> 01:59:16,640
suddenly chef suddenly chef greg rampson walks in in front of me he looks at me and says ah you're

948
01:59:16,640 --> 01:59:20,640
one of our mystery contestants i have no idea what he means so i ask him what he's talking about he

949
01:59:20,640 --> 01:59:32,840
smiles and tells me to follow him you're one of our mystery contestants follow chef rampson

950
01:59:33,479 --> 01:59:39,560
into i follow chef rampson let's see where are we going which turns out to be a changing room

951
01:59:39,560 --> 01:59:42,840
there are a bunch of other chefs waiting there too they all seem to know each other and some

952
01:59:42,840 --> 01:59:45,800
even seem to be friends so it's like what like a green room like what do you mean change what do

953
01:59:45,800 --> 01:59:53,640
you mean changing room why is it usually there's like a green room where everybody hangs out

954
01:59:53,640 --> 02:00:14,439
why are we all hanging on a changing room sit down at one of the tables and try to relax it's my big

955
02:00:14,439 --> 02:00:29,659
day i need to prove that i'm the best chef here relax chef rampson comes back into the room and

956
02:00:29,659 --> 02:00:33,579
tells us that we'll be starting soon we all put on our aprons and head back into the kitchen

957
02:00:34,140 --> 02:00:45,600
kitchen has two huge burners a grill a fryer a steamer a wok a cutting board and an oven it's

958
02:00:45,600 --> 02:00:48,640
a lot bigger than i expected it looks like the kind of kitchen you would find in a restaurant

959
02:00:49,199 --> 02:00:52,239
i start to wonder if this is really going to be a game show or something else entirely

960
02:00:52,880 --> 02:01:09,039
rampson approaches rampson approaches us and a big timer shows on a billboard behind him

961
02:01:10,329 --> 02:01:21,600
it is a countdown for the start of the show it's my turn with the cutting board
