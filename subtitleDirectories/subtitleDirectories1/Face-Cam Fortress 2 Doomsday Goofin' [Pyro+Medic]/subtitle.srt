00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:15,740
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with some Facecam Fortress 2, Monday's edition.

2
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:22,739
And today you're gonna be playing as the Pyro Scout. I don't think so. Maybe I do. Maybe you do think so.

3
00:00:22,739 --> 00:00:29,820
Oh, it's a rabbit and a goose. There's a lot of people here. Oh my word! There's a lot of people here.

4
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:40,439
Oh my god! I only... Can I take on everybody? That's the real question. Absolutely no.

5
00:00:40,439 --> 00:00:46,500
Can I get it? No, somebody already got it. Crap, he did.

6
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:52,119
Oh yeah, playing as the Pyro on the new game mode. This is Doomsday.

7
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:59,179
Give me that, Medic. Give me that, Medic!

8
00:00:59,179 --> 00:01:05,180
I actually... I kinda like this mode. It's... It's hard to play, but at the same time, it's...

9
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:10,790
No, it was a spy. It's hard to play, but at the same time, it's just total chaos.

10
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:17,790
This entire mode is just pure chaos. I don't even know how the mode works still. I mean, I do, but I don't.

11
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:23,099
You pick up the thing, you put the suitcase on. Only one person can have the suitcase.

12
00:01:23,099 --> 00:01:32,450
And you stand on the point, and you cap it, and then... I'm pretty sure I still don't know how this works after like 5,000 times playing it.

13
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:39,989
You have to put it in there. I'll do a more thorough review of this another time, but for now, it's just crazy. It's just absolute chaos.

14
00:01:39,989 --> 00:01:43,810
And they got it again. We can't have that, baby.

15
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:49,439
Hmm, looking for someone to smoke. Like this guy!

16
00:01:57,230 --> 00:02:02,310
Oh, boy. Where is he? Where is he?

17
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:06,189
Alright, he dropped it. He dropped it. He dropped it. We're good.

18
00:02:06,189 --> 00:02:12,460
Come here, get healed. Oh... I'm gonna need that health.

19
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:16,469
Gotten this thing like it's my job. Because it is.

20
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:24,169
Alright, can we get the australium? And can we stuff it in that rocket and send Poopy Joe to hell?

21
00:02:24,169 --> 00:02:29,610
A lot of scouts.

22
00:02:33,409 --> 00:02:43,099
Oh, no. I'm trying to catch him with a flare gun. I can't even hit him. I can't even light him on fire!

23
00:02:43,099 --> 00:02:47,719
My god, what's my ping? Pretty good. I don't know what's going on with that.

24
00:02:47,719 --> 00:02:50,719
This sniper is probably gonna kill me. No, he's not.

25
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:58,210
Oh, wait. Is this the sniper? My brain cannot handle these situations.

26
00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:01,210
And I missed again. And I missed again.

27
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:04,210
Not this time! Yeah, this time. You know, I'm just going in for this.

28
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:09,599
If the flare gun shot's not there today, then you might as well just go for the chaos smash.

29
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:11,969
Where's that spy?

30
00:03:11,969 --> 00:03:15,680
Oh, here we go. We're gonna cap it.

31
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,050
Come on, cap it! No! No! Somebody get up there!

32
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:25,580
That was a random critter, I think.

33
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:28,819
Oh, now I got auto-balanced.

34
00:03:28,819 --> 00:03:32,719
Well, that's one way for your recording to crash.

35
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:36,020
I'm sure there are other ways, but that's definitely one way.

36
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:40,030
Whoa. Let's start this again. I'm gonna actually...

37
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:44,030
I'm gonna get the Australian this time, and I'm gonna miss this sniper over and over again.

38
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:46,210
Maybe not this time. This time!

39
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:48,210
Nope. Scout.

40
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:50,210
Come on, come get it.

41
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:52,210
Come get it, you shut-up-a-bitch!

42
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:54,770
Spy? Spy? No.

43
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:57,650
No, no, I got it. I got it.

44
00:03:57,650 --> 00:03:59,650
Burgaphone's got it.

45
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:01,650
You know what? We're gonna fake him out!

46
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:06,879
No, there's nobody there. All right, let's go.

47
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:10,210
Let's take it down the tunnel.

48
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:13,710
I'm gonna cap this, and Poopy Joe is gonna meet his maker.

49
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:15,710
Let's sneak around this way.

50
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:19,100
I got the bomb, guys!

51
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:22,050
I got the bomb!

52
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:24,050
Protect me, please. You're not a spy. Get on here, let's do it.

53
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:27,250
Come on, dudes. Everyone hop on this point.

54
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:31,660
I'm gonna cap this right now.

55
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:34,100
It's all about the dodging. It's all about the weaving.

56
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:37,230
Get out of here!

57
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:39,230
Get out of town! Get out of town!

58
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:41,230
Open up! Open up! Come on!

59
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:43,230
Open up! Open up, you son-of-a-bitch!

60
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:45,790
Open up! Open up! Please open up!

61
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:47,790
Please open up!

62
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:49,790
Oh my god!

63
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:52,670
That takes so long!

64
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:54,670
Holy crap, that takes a thousand years to open.

65
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:59,149
All right, let's try this again.

66
00:04:59,149 --> 00:05:02,670
This thing's a toad. That was a lot.

67
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:05,870
Get out of here.

68
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:07,870
Poopy Joe. Poopy Joe.

69
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:09,870
Poopy Joe, start the chant.

70
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:12,620
Maybe it'll actually open this time.

71
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:15,740
Come on, open up.

72
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:18,560
I wanna send Poopy Joe to hell.

73
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,560
Oh god, it takes so long.

74
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,560
Get in there! Get in there!

75
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,560
Get inside!

76
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,560
Oh, here we go. Everyone's in the rocket.

77
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,560
Hey, oh my god!

78
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,560
Somebody please help me!

79
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,800
That was definitely the noise they were making when they were in that rocket.

80
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,800
Hell, that's pretty cool. I did it.

81
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,800
Go in there and dump it into the thing.

82
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,800
That's a smart idea.

83
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,800
You know, I'm not gonna stand up there.

84
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,810
That's a bad move.

85
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:48,560
I'm gonna sit right here and heal.

86
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,560
Because nobody will shoot at me.

87
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,560
I'll be able to sit down here and then I'm gonna get up top.

88
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,060
I'm gonna hit this heavy in the face.

89
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:57,230
Like this.

90
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:59,230
And like this.

91
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:01,230
And like this. Oh my god!

92
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:06,420
Hey everybody!

93
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:08,420
What's your name? My name is Jerma.

94
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:10,420
And you're gonna get smashed!

95
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:14,060
Oh my dear god!

96
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:16,060
I got an uber again.

97
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:18,620
Who can I do it to?

98
00:06:22,339 --> 00:06:24,579
I just have uber forever right now.

99
00:06:24,579 --> 00:06:28,930
Who can I do it to? There's gotta be somebody here!

100
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:31,810
Oh come on!

101
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:35,009
No! Run, run, run!

102
00:06:35,009 --> 00:06:37,889
Wow!

103
00:06:37,889 --> 00:06:41,790
Can't believe I'm still alive.

104
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:43,790
You wanna talk about combat medic?

105
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:45,790
He's almost had three ubers in a row right there.

106
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:48,800
I'll miss again.

107
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,100
Oh, he's running now. He wants none of this.

108
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:56,029
He wants none of this.

109
00:06:56,029 --> 00:06:58,980
Who can I heal?

110
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:01,920
Whoa, bad idea, bad idea!

111
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:08,509
I thought...

112
00:07:08,509 --> 00:07:10,819
They're gonna cap it.

113
00:07:10,819 --> 00:07:13,949
Unless Derpy Dash can do something insane.

114
00:07:13,949 --> 00:07:21,300
Let's move.

115
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:23,300
I think I've said that like five times coming out of spawn.

116
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:34,110
Let's do this!

117
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:42,610
That was so close!

118
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:44,610
That was so close to being a taunt kill.

119
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:48,129
But, it's the end.

120
00:07:48,129 --> 00:07:57,139
They're gonna get it. I'm just waiting.

121
00:07:57,139 --> 00:07:59,500
I got him! Did I get him?

122
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,500
Oh come on! This guy ruined everything!

123
00:08:04,379 --> 00:08:06,379
Well, that's gonna wrap it up guys.

124
00:08:06,379 --> 00:08:08,750
I'll see you guys all soon.

125
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:10,750
Thank you so much for watching. I really do appreciate it.

126
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:13,180
And of course, take care everybody.

127
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:15,180
I just spilt this.
