1
00:00:01,659 --> 00:00:09,220
How does my headphones... how do they always get so tangled? I don't understand. No matter what I do,

2
00:00:10,099 --> 00:00:18,309
I put them down, and then they just end up in like a... looks like a nest, like a sparrow's nest.

3
00:00:18,309 --> 00:00:32,679
I don't understand how it happens. So here's the plan for tonight, if you're curious. So we are

4
00:00:32,679 --> 00:00:42,310
going to play Thief Simulator for a little while, and who knows? We might... Thief Simulator

5
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:50,039
might be so much fun that we just can't stop playing it. But if it gets to be like an hour

6
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:56,020
or two in and it's like, okay, that's... that's pretty much all there is to this one, then we'll

7
00:00:56,020 --> 00:01:02,899
probably end up moving back to Red Dead. Or something else. Because there are a lot of

8
00:01:02,899 --> 00:01:10,230
options. There's a ton of things that have come out. So we'll see. To give you guys more of

9
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:14,230
an update on the green screen, the green screen has been officially pushed to Friday.

10
00:01:16,019 --> 00:01:21,140
Uh, I figured Thursday is kind of a weird day. I'd rather try to get as many people to be able

11
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:28,459
to watch it as possible. So like Friday night, Friday afternoon, I feel like is the best time.

12
00:01:28,459 --> 00:01:33,319
This... the start of the weekend. Because Thursday afternoon is just an odd time, so.

13
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:42,810
So, and speaking of that, speaking of the green screen, I do have something for you to vote

14
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:51,049
on. So, for those of you that missed the... I guess everything we've talked about so far.

15
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:55,370
Well, why don't I just let my intro go for like two or three minutes, you know?

16
00:01:56,090 --> 00:02:00,650
Because people are going to be coming in. So, give me two minutes. We'll talk about this

17
00:02:00,650 --> 00:03:11,159
when I get back. BRB. So, originally, when I first talked about the green screen, it was,

18
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:14,599
hey, we're going to do the green screen and there's going to be... there's going to be all

19
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:18,919
these voting periods and I'm not going to know what the actions are and it's going to be a secret

20
00:03:18,919 --> 00:03:24,280
and a surprise that's not happening anymore. I threw that out last week. So, I went through

21
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:32,199
and I picked from that channel on the Discord a ton of actions. There are so many actions

22
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:38,280
we'll be doing on Friday, but sometimes there's just too many, right? And some of them

23
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:44,680
we're a little on the meme-y side, a little a little on like the internet meme side.

24
00:03:45,819 --> 00:03:52,090
And I figured I, you know, I ain't doing a fucking Fortnite dance. I already took that off. So,

25
00:03:52,729 --> 00:03:56,650
I don't... that not even available. So, what you're going to vote for on this poll

26
00:03:58,539 --> 00:04:03,180
is your favorite one of these fucking memes because you only get... I'm only going to

27
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:09,849
pick the top three. So, you got... you got until like tomorrow or even maybe even tonight.

28
00:04:12,099 --> 00:04:15,300
The poll is about to go into the chat and we will sit here and just look at it for a minute.

29
00:04:17,139 --> 00:04:23,430
So, here are... and remember, keep this in mind, this is not even a taste of the

30
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:31,339
hundreds of actions that will be happening during this stream. So, there you are. We've

31
00:04:31,339 --> 00:04:41,529
got... you got to pick your favorite one out of all those. We've got the Sonic run, the

32
00:04:41,529 --> 00:04:55,160
Macarena, do the John Travolta thing, do various CSI sunglasses one-liners, spin around in So Long

33
00:04:55,160 --> 00:05:04,420
King Bowers or something, do Infinity War shit, recreate the original Up and Smoke Bee video,

34
00:05:05,699 --> 00:05:13,060
Dark Souls praise the sun, and other Dark Souls gestures, and then do JoJo poses.

35
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:22,810
I don't know what that even means. What is do JoJo poses? I don't even know what that is.

36
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:36,329
It's... okay, well, it wasn't a Fortnite dance, so I didn't... should I have vetoed that?

37
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:47,939
This is so one-sided. Why is... why is this so one-sided right now?

38
00:05:50,939 --> 00:05:56,620
Veto JoJo's? I didn't... I didn't know what it was. I vetoed Dab, I vetoed default Fortnite

39
00:05:56,620 --> 00:06:01,589
dance, and I vetoed re-enact the whole gnome video. I ain't doing... I can't be worse than

40
00:06:01,589 --> 00:06:13,420
those. Is it worse than... is it worse than those? I only got three vetoes. Did I fuck

41
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:27,769
myself? Did I just fuck myself over so bad by not vetoing the JoJo poses? Look them up.

42
00:06:27,769 --> 00:06:37,399
Well, whatever. So, by the way, the top three... the top three will be brought in because there

43
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:41,160
are so many things. I could just open up the list. You know, I'm gonna open up the list

44
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:48,170
and I'm just gonna read you like two things, okay? Here's a couple of great ones. By the

45
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:53,699
way, I got hundreds of actions. Just make sure you're aware of that. I can't wait to

46
00:06:53,699 --> 00:07:03,990
do a full weather report in a suit. That's gonna be fucking fun. Looking forward to act

47
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:12,600
like an alien is bursting out of your chest. That's gonna be a lot of fun. Dude, the Looney

48
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:20,870
Toons outro. That's gonna be fun too. There's so many of these. This is gonna... oh god.

49
00:07:22,629 --> 00:07:28,009
So, this... I'm gonna... I'm gonna take a lot of time. I'm gonna do like some rehearsal

50
00:07:28,009 --> 00:07:41,560
for this. There's plenty... there's plenty of stuff here. Okay, so do... does that include

51
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:46,100
like the porky pig? Am I gonna have to like put my hands out to the sides and go like,

52
00:07:47,379 --> 00:07:57,850
that's all, folks? Is that like what... that's what it is, right? Well, this should be a lot

53
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:06,060
of fun. I can just turn into a stream outro. And, again, let me reiterate this one more

54
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:10,060
time because people... I think I'm confusing a lot of people. And because we're getting,

55
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:14,459
you know, three, four days out, three days out here, let me make sure people are aware

56
00:08:14,459 --> 00:08:17,980
of what's going on. Because I feel like a lot of people still have no idea what I'm doing.

57
00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:24,579
What is the sonic run? I don't... I don't know. The sonic... when your hands are behind your back

58
00:08:24,579 --> 00:08:31,100
and you like run with your head down. What isn't it? Like Naruto? I don't know.

59
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:40,679
Why would that be the sonic run? But whatever. Anyways, after this green screen is filmed,

60
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:47,480
two, maybe three weeks later, depending on how much time I want to... I would say two weeks

61
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:54,570
is good. Two weeks later, this is not a contest, we're going to have a movie night

62
00:08:55,289 --> 00:09:01,830
where we watch the shit that you guys made. There will be rules and I will talk about them

63
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:09,000
at great length after the stream is done on what is going to happen. But all of these

64
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:15,669
videos that we'll be watching will be pre-screened. They have to be at least

65
00:09:15,669 --> 00:09:24,740
10 seconds long and they have to be no more than two minutes long. So those are the rules.

66
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:28,580
Nobody... there's no contest. There's no like, somebody wins, somebody loses. We're just going

67
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:37,590
to have fun. But we're here. It's time to play Thief Simulator for a little while.

68
00:09:38,309 --> 00:09:45,559
Do they have to be school appropriate? Yes, they have to be very appropriate.

69
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:52,360
They have... like you have to be able to be able to like sit down next to your parents

70
00:09:52,360 --> 00:10:05,669
and watch these. All right, let me drop this down. That poll will be going till

71
00:10:05,669 --> 00:10:12,200
at least tonight. Family movie night. No, it doesn't have to be family friendly per se,

72
00:10:13,399 --> 00:10:18,600
but it can't... it can't just... you don't... listen, do I need to spell it out for you?

73
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:30,139
Hold on, let me just get this on here. All right, I'll spell it out for you.

74
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:43,529
No sexual content. No hateful bullshit. Fun. There can be violence. There can be weird shit, but

75
00:10:43,529 --> 00:10:52,330
no... none of that bullshit, okay? And it's... they're all going to be pre-screened anyway,

76
00:10:52,330 --> 00:11:05,299
so we'll be fine. All right, I'm ready. Anything is sexual to me. What does that even mean?

77
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:13,830
Wait, JoJo poses all sexual? No, they're not.

78
00:11:17,769 --> 00:11:26,629
They're not. They're not. And look, we could... we're gonna have fun with it, but

79
00:11:27,429 --> 00:11:38,840
you guys... you guys know. You're all... you all understand. Use common sense. You can be stupid,

80
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:44,740
you can be weird, you can be fucking crazy, but just no over the line shit, all right? Like

81
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:49,940
just... you understand. I feel like you guys... you guys... we're all fucking in our 30s here.

82
00:11:49,940 --> 00:12:04,059
We're all old enough to know. Why are we stuck at 99? Oh, okay. Is... am I just playing hitman?

83
00:12:04,059 --> 00:12:23,559
Is that what this is? It's Vinny. Is that actually Vinny? Hold on, is that... is that Vinny?

84
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:36,919
Oh, wait, hold on. I can't even hear it. Oops. There's no sound. Oops-a-daisy. All right,

85
00:12:36,919 --> 00:12:46,070
I need to change some settings here, because wowee. Quality high. Ambient occlusion,

86
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:55,860
I don't want that. And FPS 60 sounds. That's... you just couldn't hear it because I'm an idiot.

87
00:12:56,950 --> 00:13:02,919
Any FOV slider? I don't think so. All right, look... I need to like turn that down though.

88
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:09,299
Mouse sensitivity, that's gonna go down. A mouse sensitivity car. This game already became

89
00:13:09,299 --> 00:13:17,240
a full letter grade. Is it at least a D already? Okay. No, even more than that.

90
00:13:20,039 --> 00:13:25,929
Even more than that. All right, that's fine. All right, pick up the crowbar.

91
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:32,629
Pick up the crowbar. E. Here's Vinny.

92
00:13:47,559 --> 00:13:50,759
I don't think that's Vinny. I don't... I'm not sure that that's actually Vinny. All right,

93
00:13:50,759 --> 00:13:59,659
inventory. Why does inventory open up my... oh, okay. So, put it in my hand. All right,

94
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:05,240
quick slot. T. You can add items to the quick slot for faster usage. Go to inventory,

95
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:12,409
select an item, and press the quick slot button. Okay, so press the quick slot button. Wait, so...

96
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:23,830
Okay, there it is. So tab is my quick slot. Break the fence. One hit. That's all it took.

97
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:30,899
I got a strike. All right, that's it. Sneaking. Sneaking allows you to make less noise,

98
00:14:30,899 --> 00:14:37,860
but will make you slower. Default. C. E. You can also lean by pressing space and left and right.

99
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:49,929
So C, and if I hold space and go like this, I can sneak. Okay, sneak by the window. No,

100
00:14:49,929 --> 00:14:59,529
I was about to hit the fence. All right, so I guess you can see the Metal Gear Solid

101
00:14:59,529 --> 00:15:04,820
windows down there. Light and visibility. When sneaking around at night, it's best to avoid

102
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:09,700
well-lit places. Your flashlight will also make you easy to spot. So, avoid well-lit

103
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:20,620
places like that. Go through the bushes. Avoid all the light. Vinnie! Hey, some dope left a

104
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:26,360
flashlight on the ground. Take it, but don't let nobody see the light and call the cops.

105
00:15:27,399 --> 00:15:36,330
Okay. What's with this 110, 111, one of these addresses? Flashlight. Break the window with

106
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:51,159
the crowbar. So, flashlight is F. Well, that's huge. Wait, this one. Break the window with the

107
00:15:51,159 --> 00:16:02,259
crowbar. Lockpicking level four. Glass knife. Interact. So, wait. Okay. Just smash the guy's

108
00:16:02,259 --> 00:16:18,389
window. Open the window. How do I go in? Oh. Yeah! What's up, Vinnie? All right. Steal.

109
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:24,919
Take the bed. Flashlight will help you see the loot in the dark. Remember, you're easy to detect

110
00:16:24,919 --> 00:16:36,389
with the flashlight on. All right. How do I take the bed? Oh, let's just hide under bed. All

111
00:16:36,389 --> 00:16:50,860
right. So, steal some stuff. Shoes. Open slowly. It's hold E. Is somebody in the house? I don't

112
00:16:50,860 --> 00:17:00,940
know. I think they're outside. Oh, that's loud. Getting something WD-40 on here. What is it?

113
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:17,339
$15. I got it. What else do we got here? Plates. A teapot. 3LD. What the hell? LD. What is it?

114
00:17:17,339 --> 00:17:33,980
What is LD? 11LD. Pot. Load? Light density? There's nobody even in this house, so I can

115
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:43,500
just do it. Toaster. Yep. Time to bail, man. Get in the car. Don't let nobody see you

116
00:17:43,500 --> 00:18:03,799
with that crowbar. Okay. Take the fry pan. I thought it was not locked. Okay. Unwanted

117
00:18:03,799 --> 00:18:08,279
attention. Unequip tools and turn off the flashlight to avoid unwanted attention from

118
00:18:08,279 --> 00:18:18,650
other people. There's somebody in front of me. Is my voice talking? No. All right. Where's

119
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:34,579
this car? It's like over here. Can I jump the fence? So, we just have to get in the car.

120
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:56,180
I get to drive? How do I turn it on? Oh, God. Drive out of the location. I'm not gonna toot

121
00:18:56,180 --> 00:19:15,930
the horn. Why would I blow the horn right now? It's a crosswalk! Press space. No, I'm

122
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:20,759
not gonna cry. I gotta get out of this tutorial. I can change the camera?

123
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:35,210
That's... Okay, the sensitivity is insane right here. That's what that means. Okay. Yep.

124
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:48,759
Figured out what that one is. That's why it's great. You're a thief.

125
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:57,059
I mean, yeah. I just... I got an A. My thief rating is an A. I took a pot. I took a toaster.

126
00:19:57,059 --> 00:20:07,930
Saucepan. Teapot. New hints available. Mouse 2 is mark. Quick slot. Left shift is run.

127
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:14,940
Oh. Good job, man. This just might work. Go get some sleep and we'll pick this up

128
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:25,339
in the morning. You actually have a house? So, do I get a better car?

129
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:33,799
I can go on the computer! This is cool. Ooh. Simple lockpick. Whatever. I got $42.

130
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:43,019
Climbing gloves. Electric lockpick. Jewelry tools. Safe cracking. Glass knife. Hacking tools.

131
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:54,660
A micro camera. A hacking laptop. Why is a hacking laptop? $52,000.

132
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:06,970
That seems a little... This is called... Black Bay. Car parts. Electronics. Kitchen.

133
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:17,799
Oh, alright. I can sell this on the black market. Why would you sell a saucepan on,

134
00:21:17,799 --> 00:21:26,390
like, the dark web? Yeah, that's right. I got a cast iron pan. I'll sell it to you for

135
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:36,279
$10 off what you'd buy it at Walmart. Okay. Now I got more money.

136
00:21:37,619 --> 00:21:46,710
Steal your forums. House security tips. On these, like, addresses? Rent a thug?

Lugged in as thug322. This is not... I did not think this game was gonna be this elaborate.

00:21:57,509 --> 00:22:07,299
Okay. So how about, like, simple lockpick? I don't have lockpicking 1. I already have a crowbar. I

139
00:22:07,299 --> 00:22:14,759
got a flashlight. So I just have to go to bed. There's another computer? Device workshop.

140
00:22:16,099 --> 00:22:21,619
Requires hacking tools and electronics 1. What's this RPG? I was sleeping on a couch.

147
00:23:22,099 --> 00:23:31,420
Old TV worth a dollar. Spare door key in the drawer. And there is no one home

148
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:39,720
all the time. What? Is that home security or is this nobody just... nobody live here?

149
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:52,089
Okay. So we're gonna need an old TV to spare key. All right. Old TV.

150
00:23:56,490 --> 00:24:02,259
You'll need empty pockets at Greenview 109. Yeah, I already did it, right?

151
00:24:02,259 --> 00:24:09,640
Stealth stuff at the pawn shop. Isn't that what I just did? Where am I gonna get...

152
00:24:10,519 --> 00:24:21,900
Oh, shit. So could I have gotten more? All right. Can I steal from the pawn shop? That's

153
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:28,779
important, right? Oh, there's an old regular Nintendo here. That's probably worth a lot

154
00:24:28,779 --> 00:24:36,440
of money. I don't think I can take it. Wait, can I? No. Take the lawnmower?

155
00:24:41,289 --> 00:24:42,650
You have anything in your trash?

156
00:24:48,440 --> 00:25:01,849
An old sofa? Welcome back. Okay, I may need this. An old toaster.

157
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:13,079
I couldn't even sell that on the dark web. It's time for Greenview 109. Get me that TV

158
00:25:13,079 --> 00:25:32,250
and don't pawn it off. I don't think you can... Nope. Sorry, guys. I tried. Big items.

159
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:45,900
I don't pawn the TV, he said. Oh, right. I can't... I'm so used to, like, GTA. All right,

161
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:19,640
Load it in the car trunk and drive home. All right, 109. Right here. Oh, that's not

162
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:38,660
suspicious. There's nobody here. Whoa! All right, remember the back. There's nobody even

163
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:48,940
in the house. I could just take my time. What is this? Who has a dumpster back here?

164
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:52,940
You have a dumpster in the back of your house? This dumpster is almost as big as your whole

165
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:59,559
house. You could fit a bedroom in here. All right. There's the damage fence. Get that open.

166
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:20,259
All right. So, wait, we got a spare key, right? What does the spare key go to? Front door.

167
00:27:30,299 --> 00:27:37,700
Got it. What else you got in here? Toaster! We know those are expensive.

168
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:56,230
Fridge. Money in the trash. Bathtub. Ketchup bottle? No. All right, so old TV. Hold on.

169
00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:14,900
Yeah, here we go. Okay. Carry. Can you throw it?

170
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:22,619
No, not really. Okay, well, whatever. Oh, shit! There's a person right here.

171
00:28:29,299 --> 00:28:35,430
Big items. To steal a big item, TV or printer, etc. Put it in the car's trunk and drive home.

172
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:46,490
The sale begin of the pond. You need to put them next to the shop owner. It's all right. It's just

173
00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:51,210
Wilson. What's his name next door? Tim Allen. The guy with the eyes and the hat.

174
00:28:52,009 --> 00:29:14,569
She's standing on the car. Get out of the way. Can I throw a coin over there? What the fuck?

175
00:29:18,549 --> 00:29:33,180
Sprint with a TV. Am I going to be able to sneak behind? She's always facing this way.

176
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:44,940
Here comes somebody else. Wait, is she stuck in the door? No, she's not. She's just standing

177
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:55,079
here. She's just standing here waiting. Can I like do something? Can I like push her down?

178
00:29:55,880 --> 00:30:13,589
All right, I'll put the TV down. What the fuck? Oh, fuck. Oh, a car. Oh, what is it? The

179
00:30:13,589 --> 00:30:39,430
homeowner? So what am I supposed to do about this? Okay, so I can't hurt that person?

180
00:30:42,490 --> 00:30:48,819
It's a Steve simulator. God, now I gotta move the car out of the way.

181
00:30:49,539 --> 00:31:09,220
This car damage. Look at the car. The back fence can be broken easily.

182
00:31:11,609 --> 00:31:34,200
Really? Okay, come on. Get out. All right, that's fine. Get the TV. Give me the money too.

183
00:31:34,759 --> 00:32:01,430
Just leave a big shit in his toilet. That's disgusting.

184
00:32:04,579 --> 00:32:11,940
Oh, there's money down here. TV down. I want that money.

185
00:32:13,779 --> 00:32:19,380
Yeah, big items. You gotta be put in the trunk before the lady gets here.

186
00:32:20,099 --> 00:32:30,619
She's about to cross right now. No, she's not. No, I got the back. I'm in the back.

187
00:32:38,359 --> 00:32:41,720
I'm not going to go to the bathroom in this person's house. Okay, guys, please.

188
00:32:42,519 --> 00:33:01,220
How do I like get it out there? All right, load up the old TV. All right,

189
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:29,480
get it in the trunk. Okay, well, that's one way to do it. All right, I'm ready. Okay,

190
00:33:30,119 --> 00:33:38,470
uh, steal a TV from loading the car and drive out of here. We're gonna take this road.

191
00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:57,799
How do I? Where's my home? Am I going just to drive out? Oh, there we go. Home. Road.

192
00:33:59,559 --> 00:34:02,839
Old TV. You got the key. Remember to spend unused skill points.

193
00:34:04,099 --> 00:34:12,920
S exclamation point. That's better than S plus. I see you got my screen. Go to black bay.

194
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:29,139
All right, I set up a page on there for the TV. Go there and sell it. Okay, electronics. Old TV,

195
00:34:29,139 --> 00:34:39,699
60 bucks. Yeah, good work. Now click on the rent a thug tab. Now here you can find a little

196
00:34:39,699 --> 00:34:48,940
extra work. I put one on there just for you. The one with the dishes. Okay, at 110 go break

197
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:56,460
their dishes. And that's it. This is the equivalent of if you just shit in the toilet and left.

198
00:34:56,460 --> 00:35:08,440
That's going to be one eventually, isn't it? Okay, now break the dishes. Okay,

199
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:16,119
leaving up a decker at 111. If you don't know what that is, that's when you shit in a water

200
00:35:16,119 --> 00:35:34,789
tank. You leave it. You have to unlock, you have to unlock the couch shitting quest or break

201
00:35:34,869 --> 00:35:47,719
the dishes at 1110. We can't even see it. I just wanted to see it. We can't, we don't even get to

202
00:35:47,719 --> 00:35:56,070
see the damn thing. What the fuck? Did I already do this? Okay, good. Is there just no ragdoll

203
00:35:56,070 --> 00:36:09,269
or physics engine or something? I mean, I didn't even try. Cell pots and pans. But he told me

204
00:36:09,269 --> 00:36:15,590
to go to 110 and smash dishes. So I gotta do that first. He didn't even try to swerve. No,

205
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:21,369
I was trying to run that person over. I was trying to kill that person because I wanted,

206
00:36:21,369 --> 00:36:25,289
I just needed to know if we could see anything. All right, so 110 smash.

207
00:36:31,269 --> 00:36:52,980
I'm dead. I got some dishes to smash. Somebody in this house? Windows locked,

208
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:59,269
windows locked. That's not going to stop us. Get in. So now break their dishes.

209
00:37:01,050 --> 00:37:11,449
I can't even take their toaster or anything. That's my house. No, it's not.

210
00:37:23,739 --> 00:37:35,940
Is it? So they have, they have physics and breakable plates, but not run overable humans.

211
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:50,019
What's up with that? So that's it. This is, what do you got here?

212
00:37:51,050 --> 00:37:55,800
Deodorant. Any money in the liner? What's wrong with the toilet?

213
00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:04,820
Okay, well now there's something very wrong with it. Um, all right, well that's it.

214
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:17,820
Just gonna get back in the car. Sleep in bed. You can't sleep in bed. All you can do is

215
00:38:18,619 --> 00:38:27,500
crawl under it. Car. For a second I thought somebody was in the car.

216
00:38:31,349 --> 00:38:36,679
No, I'm not gonna crawl under it. I already did that. All right, let's leave.

217
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:43,000
That is the drive to the edge of the universe here. What's beep?

218
00:38:51,639 --> 00:38:55,000
Can you even, can you even get in a car accident? You probably can't.

219
00:39:00,070 --> 00:39:13,139
Cook poop will pre-record it. Wait, hold on. I don't have that.

220
00:39:13,139 --> 00:39:40,420
I can't even break their mailboxes. Yeah, let's go.

221
00:39:54,329 --> 00:40:01,460
How is that a C? All right Vinny, give me a call. Learn lockpicking level one.

222
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:17,449
Uh, from where, over here. Car. Okay, rent a thug. Let me sell all this shit though.

223
00:40:19,769 --> 00:40:26,090
Kitchen. Other. Antiques. Art. Uh, this is what they want. Somebody wants this stuff.

224
00:40:26,650 --> 00:40:33,139
So it's just like here. Okay, skills.

225
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:40,489
The skill what is? Lockpicking level one. Open easy locks and lockpicks. Sure thing.

226
00:40:41,050 --> 00:40:46,780
Notes. Uh, okay. We got some, we got that job done.

227
00:40:48,139 --> 00:40:50,699
Skills. We just learned lockpicking. Here's Vinny.

228
00:40:57,340 --> 00:41:06,539
Okay. DIY simple lockpick. I have $230. Got it.

229
00:41:38,019 --> 00:41:41,300
That's too bad. I was thinking it was gonna just do like seven days.

230
00:41:42,579 --> 00:41:48,380
It's Jerma's day? What? Okay, let's open it.

231
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:53,659
So you need to find the right angle with the bobby pin and then rotate the lock.

232
00:41:53,659 --> 00:41:57,980
The closer the pin gets to the correct angle, more the lock will rotate.

233
00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:09,369
So rotate is just D. Okay, so this is just, this is just like fallout.

234
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:25,900
Okay. Somebody in jail?

235
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:29,019
When close enough you can mark a tenant to discover his daily routines.

236
00:42:30,059 --> 00:42:34,139
Middle mouse button. Okay, you can also mark cameras to show their viewing angle.

237
00:42:34,699 --> 00:42:37,900
View range. Check tenant routines in the top right corner. Blue means they are out.

238
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:40,059
Tenant routines are also available in the notes menu.

239
00:42:40,219 --> 00:42:49,219
Okay. So go to 111 around 7 a.m. and mark the tenant.

240
00:42:53,139 --> 00:43:01,639
So let's give us a little bit of time here. It's 5 a.m.

241
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:07,380
I'm really gonna turn off the stereo before I go to bed.

242
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:13,880
Sell your stuff? I, I can't. Nobody wants it.

243
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:19,239
Missing required items. I can't. The golden goblet.

244
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:24,039
Car parts. Electronics. I can't. The kitchen. Go to the pawn shop?

245
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:31,980
Yeah, but I'm like a time limit now. I just, I would have woken up at four o'clock in the morning.

246
00:43:32,619 --> 00:43:44,699
What time is it right now? 5 20 a.m. All right, I gotta make this quick.

247
00:43:44,699 --> 00:43:48,760
Welcome back. All right, so saucepan.

248
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:54,889
That's all I bring into this guy.

249
00:43:57,019 --> 00:43:59,579
Hey Jeremy. Hey man, what's up? Uh, you got the usual?

250
00:43:59,579 --> 00:44:04,300
Yeah, I got a couple of toasters, uh, pots and pans, um, in a vase.

251
00:44:04,860 --> 00:44:08,199
Oh, sweet dude. Yeah, I'll be back tomorrow with the same stuff.

252
00:44:08,199 --> 00:44:16,170
At what point is this guy gonna hold his hand up and be like, Jeremy,

253
00:44:16,170 --> 00:44:19,210
Jeremy, you've given me like 30 toasters, man, and nobody buys them.

254
00:44:19,849 --> 00:44:25,619
Okay, so it's 5 a.m. Just gotta get to 111 around 7 and mark the guy there.

255
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:31,210
Is this person in a car or are they walking? Okay, they're walking.

256
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:39,559
111 was, it's a three-point turn. You've never seen somebody do that before?

257
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:50,940
I just broke the road. The road just crumbled underneath me.

258
00:44:51,579 --> 00:44:55,829
Okay, so let's get out of the way with his no, out of suspicion.

259
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:04,840
I like under the McDonald's heat lamp. That's a great place.

260
00:45:06,039 --> 00:45:09,639
Right under the light. All right, it's 7 a.m. Okay, I gotta get ready.

261
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:14,940
I gotta get a good vantage point up on the seesaw.

262
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:21,099
Okay, what time is it? 6 30. He's right there.

263
00:45:24,489 --> 00:45:26,329
Sleeping in the parking lot.

264
00:45:26,329 --> 00:45:30,500
Sleep in the car at the parking lot to pass time.

265
00:45:34,579 --> 00:45:39,460
There's a box in there. Wait for them to leave and get me that box.

266
00:45:40,699 --> 00:45:42,219
So go sleep, wait for them.

267
00:45:42,219 --> 00:45:45,179
Okay, hint discovered. Important box inside.

268
00:45:45,179 --> 00:45:49,940
So what about his routines here? Living room or out?

269
00:45:57,030 --> 00:45:58,789
I can just sit here and wait, though.

270
00:45:58,789 --> 00:46:01,989
Wouldn't I rather do it like this or go, no, look at the timer up there.

271
00:46:01,989 --> 00:46:04,469
He'll be out of the living room.

272
00:46:05,110 --> 00:46:12,900
He just looked over here. So I gotta sprint in, grab the box.

273
00:46:19,340 --> 00:46:21,900
I can look at every inch of this guy's entire house.

274
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:24,780
I don't even need a camera. I just move back and forth.

275
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:26,940
I am the camera. All right, we need like a point of interest, though.

276
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:31,539
He's standing up to change the channel on the TV.

277
00:46:34,019 --> 00:46:36,900
Are you sure he's not using the toaster? He might be.

278
00:46:37,619 --> 00:46:51,780
So all right, go sleep in my car.

279
00:46:54,150 --> 00:46:57,909
So it is currently 7 47 a.m.

280
00:46:58,710 --> 00:47:06,539
So sleep in car. How do I sleep in the car?

281
00:47:07,179 --> 00:47:15,699
I have to sleep in the trunk? How do I sleep in there?

282
00:47:16,340 --> 00:47:21,110
Oh, I have to be over there.

283
00:47:21,750 --> 00:47:29,000
Hey, watch this. What would be the ultimate asshole?

284
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:34,780
Ain't nobody parking here.

285
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:40,260
All right, let's sleep until 9 a.m.

286
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:45,130
That was a good nap. All right, where is he?

287
00:47:58,360 --> 00:48:16,809
Is he gone? Oh, is that him?

288
00:48:34,139 --> 00:48:36,860
Oh, I took, I took the most important thing in his whole house, guys.

289
00:48:36,860 --> 00:48:44,940
I took the TV. How is he going to change the channels now?

290
00:48:46,699 --> 00:48:48,380
Actually, okay. Hold on. I guess I could.

291
00:48:48,380 --> 00:48:49,500
He's got barred windows.

292
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:12,920
Get me out of here. Oh, I stuck back here.

293
00:49:15,079 --> 00:49:16,920
How did I wait? Oh, my God.

294
00:49:30,889 --> 00:49:32,570
Go through. You can't go through.

295
00:49:33,369 --> 00:49:43,820
Come on. Come on. I want the TV too.

296
00:49:43,820 --> 00:49:44,460
I'll get them both.

297
00:49:49,340 --> 00:49:50,539
Come on. Come on. He's still out.

298
00:49:50,539 --> 00:49:58,599
I'm still good. Hold shift.

299
00:49:58,599 --> 00:49:59,880
He can't run with the TV.

300
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:08,389
I got another item. Important box.

301
00:50:08,949 --> 00:50:19,769
All right. He's got money. He's got a lot of money.

302
00:50:19,769 --> 00:50:21,690
Take it. That's a lot of money.

303
00:50:21,690 --> 00:50:45,539
Where's the box? I made it.

304
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:58,119
Every single victim needs to have a smashed toilet.

305
00:51:00,619 --> 00:51:04,860
No. All right.

306
00:51:04,860 --> 00:51:07,500
So wait till no one's home to steal the important box.

307
00:51:08,059 --> 00:51:17,030
How did I not steal the box?

308
00:51:17,030 --> 00:51:23,829
Box with shady content. That's not it.

309
00:51:23,829 --> 00:51:29,780
So why is it telling me to still do it?

310
00:51:37,559 --> 00:51:39,400
Just live. Well, why wouldn't it just say leave?

311
00:51:40,219 --> 00:51:47,320
I got it. Let's go home first.

312
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:48,440
Then I'm going to pawn the TV.

313
00:51:52,820 --> 00:51:54,579
That's all I want is a B.

314
00:51:54,579 --> 00:51:56,179
Remember to spend unused skill points.

315
00:51:56,179 --> 00:51:58,119
I got a B. I'll take it.

316
00:51:59,719 --> 00:52:00,920
New hints now. Level up.

317
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:02,679
So what can I level up?

318
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:10,579
This seems like a branching Diablo 2 skill tree here.

319
00:52:10,579 --> 00:52:12,099
All right. We've got lockpicking level two.

320
00:52:16,150 --> 00:52:18,389
I need to go from here.

321
00:52:19,190 --> 00:52:20,949
Open normal locks with a lockpick.

322
00:52:21,750 --> 00:52:22,869
Open easy locks.

323
00:52:22,869 --> 00:52:27,960
Okay. Well, now we opened it up.

324
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:28,679
More notes.

325
00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:35,059
So he's out between 9 a.m. and 11 a.m.

326
00:52:36,039 --> 00:52:40,440
And he's asleep from 6 a.m. until 11.

327
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:41,159
That's not correct.

328
00:52:42,570 --> 00:52:44,010
There's two people that live in this house.

329
00:52:49,659 --> 00:52:52,940
Yeah, he's asleep from 5 a.m. to 11.

330
00:52:53,019 --> 00:52:56,300
And he's out from 9 a.m. to 11.

331
00:52:56,300 --> 00:52:57,900
Okay. So he sleepwalks.

332
00:52:58,539 --> 00:53:00,699
He goes and makes eggs at the neighbor's house.

333
00:53:02,519 --> 00:53:10,260
Okay. Let's go.

334
00:53:10,260 --> 00:53:11,460
Let's see what I can do here.

335
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:13,139
Send the box via Black Bay.

336
00:53:13,860 --> 00:53:17,030
Just keep taking that guy's TV.

337
00:53:18,809 --> 00:53:23,829
Okay. We got other box with shady content.

338
00:53:23,829 --> 00:53:24,710
It's a hundred bucks.

339
00:53:25,670 --> 00:53:28,170
Okay. Nice.

340
00:53:30,489 --> 00:53:31,130
What's next?

341
00:53:31,130 --> 00:53:35,210
The Lombardies think their friend on Greenview needs a new window.

342
00:53:36,010 --> 00:53:38,090
They think the one they got is fine.

343
00:53:39,210 --> 00:53:40,570
Go prove them wrong.

344
00:53:40,570 --> 00:53:43,690
So smash a window in 112 and then hide or run away.

345
00:53:44,809 --> 00:53:46,309
We got it.

346
00:53:49,139 --> 00:53:50,579
Smash a window in 112.

347
00:53:51,539 --> 00:53:59,019
But first, let's see what we can get for this television.

348
00:54:07,050 --> 00:54:07,849
Welcome back.

349
00:54:08,789 --> 00:54:09,349
Big item.

350
00:54:18,010 --> 00:54:19,929
TV. $40 for the TV.

351
00:54:20,809 --> 00:54:22,090
And another pot.

352
00:54:22,090 --> 00:54:24,900
I got some money now.

353
00:54:25,380 --> 00:54:32,150
You wish you thieves were as incompetent as Germo.

354
00:54:32,150 --> 00:54:33,429
I don't do thievery.

355
00:54:34,070 --> 00:54:36,840
I don't break into people's houses.

356
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:38,119
Of course.

357
00:54:38,119 --> 00:54:39,960
Why would I be good at something that I don't do?

358
00:54:40,679 --> 00:54:44,340
Can you believe this guy?

359
00:54:44,340 --> 00:54:46,260
He can't even perform like a heart surgery.

360
00:54:46,260 --> 00:54:48,420
I've never fucking performed heart surgery.

361
00:54:48,420 --> 00:55:01,260
All right. 112.

362
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:07,880
Are those two things equatable?

363
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:12,139
Because I don't know how to do things.

364
00:55:12,139 --> 00:55:13,500
I don't know how to do what I've never done.

365
00:55:14,300 --> 00:55:16,820
I don't know what like a lockpick does.

366
00:55:16,820 --> 00:55:18,099
I never even touched one.

367
00:55:18,099 --> 00:55:19,460
I've never held one in my hand.

368
00:55:20,420 --> 00:55:27,500
Now these ones are up here.

369
00:55:28,699 --> 00:55:30,059
All right. Let's park it.

370
00:55:30,059 --> 00:55:37,769
I don't even know what it does.

371
00:55:42,730 --> 00:55:44,889
Break a window in 112 and hide or run.

372
00:55:45,530 --> 00:55:49,670
So I'm just like a regular person, right?

373
00:55:49,670 --> 00:55:50,789
So I don't have to worry about it.

374
00:55:50,789 --> 00:55:52,869
If they see me, as long as I don't have the crowbar out, I'm fine.

375
00:55:53,590 --> 00:55:55,050
So this is 112.

376
00:55:55,769 --> 00:55:57,849
Can I peek? Can I jump?

377
00:55:58,650 --> 00:56:05,369
You put the lockpick in the thing and rotate the lock.

378
00:56:05,369 --> 00:56:06,329
That's not how it works.

379
00:56:07,289 --> 00:56:25,239
I can't climb a fence because I don't have enough agility.

380
00:56:25,239 --> 00:56:28,889
Okay. Well, is there somebody in the house?

381
00:56:29,690 --> 00:56:32,039
Can I reach from here?

382
00:56:35,610 --> 00:56:36,889
Just throw the crowbar in there.

383
00:56:45,019 --> 00:56:46,219
Is somebody in the house?

384
00:56:46,219 --> 00:56:46,940
No one's in the house.

385
00:56:50,579 --> 00:56:51,079
Whoa!

386
00:57:01,699 --> 00:57:03,219
Just about to rob you.

387
00:57:03,219 --> 00:57:04,420
All right. I got two people marked.

388
00:57:04,420 --> 00:57:05,619
They're at the garden.

389
00:57:05,619 --> 00:57:07,460
They go to the garden now.

390
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:09,559
Break their window.

391
00:57:09,559 --> 00:57:10,679
All right. So I got to break this.

392
00:57:10,679 --> 00:57:11,559
I'm sprinting right behind me.

393
00:57:11,559 --> 00:57:13,480
Here we go. One, two, three, action.

394
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:18,170
What is this?

395
00:57:19,130 --> 00:57:22,969
Stealing stuff from returning home with loot gives you extra experience points.

396
00:57:22,969 --> 00:57:26,570
The first time theft will give 10 times more experience.

397
00:57:27,530 --> 00:57:29,690
If you're not sure what to do, check your computer.

398
00:57:30,489 --> 00:57:31,769
All right. Why are the police here?

399
00:57:32,489 --> 00:57:33,610
The police are called?

400
00:57:35,099 --> 00:57:35,980
Hide? Where do I hide?

401
00:57:38,469 --> 00:57:39,590
Oh, they have an alarm.

402
00:57:41,059 --> 00:57:41,780
Hide in the dumpster.

403
00:57:50,659 --> 00:57:52,579
You can run away from police by leaving the neighborhood

404
00:57:52,579 --> 00:57:54,739
or you can hide in a closet, a dumpster under the bed

405
00:57:54,739 --> 00:57:56,900
and wait for the police to leave.

406
00:57:56,900 --> 00:57:59,380
If the visibility eye is red, someone saw you

407
00:57:59,380 --> 00:58:00,659
and the police will find you.

408
00:58:06,969 --> 00:58:07,929
No one's going to find me.

409
00:58:08,570 --> 00:58:10,840
No one saw me go into this particular...

410
00:58:11,639 --> 00:58:15,690
That is if you go in this dumpster.

411
00:58:27,190 --> 00:58:28,070
When does this stop?

412
00:58:36,579 --> 00:58:37,699
Do I have to run away?

413
00:58:43,750 --> 00:58:44,949
You live here now.

414
00:58:54,340 --> 00:59:00,579
I feel like this is supposed to be done.

415
00:59:01,460 --> 00:59:02,099
Should I get out?

416
00:59:02,739 --> 00:59:09,420
How would they know it's you?

417
00:59:09,420 --> 00:59:10,139
That's a good question.

418
00:59:10,139 --> 00:59:12,380
All right. I'm going to get out and sprint to the left as fast as I can.

419
00:59:14,460 --> 00:59:16,699
Oh, music off. Music's done.

420
00:59:16,699 --> 00:59:20,460
There's one star now.

421
00:59:21,019 --> 00:59:23,380
Oh, no, no, no. They're leaving.

422
00:59:37,030 --> 00:59:38,309
There were no police after all.

423
00:59:38,949 --> 00:59:39,750
All right. Where's my car?

424
00:59:40,389 --> 00:59:41,349
Over here.

425
00:59:41,349 --> 00:59:47,719
Somebody was just playing police sounds to scare me.

426
00:59:48,360 --> 00:59:51,690
What would you be suspicious of?

427
00:59:51,690 --> 00:59:52,329
I don't have anything up.

428
00:59:54,059 --> 00:59:55,500
Why are there people surrounding my car?

429
01:00:03,349 --> 01:00:06,150
The car is parked in a strange place.

430
01:00:14,659 --> 01:00:18,550
The police are going to tow my car.

431
01:00:23,690 --> 01:00:24,730
What? Get...

432
01:00:27,510 --> 01:00:28,309
Don't hit them.

433
01:00:28,309 --> 01:00:29,510
Don't. I can't go anywhere.

434
01:00:29,510 --> 01:00:30,309
Either one of these two.

435
01:00:47,989 --> 01:00:49,989
Open a standard training lock.

436
01:00:49,989 --> 01:00:52,440
Oh, I did it. I win.

437
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:57,829
This is so unsettling.

438
01:00:58,550 --> 01:01:01,699
All right. We got easy lock.

439
01:01:03,079 --> 01:01:04,039
Standard lock.

440
01:01:04,039 --> 01:01:05,159
Requires a lockpick.

441
01:01:06,039 --> 01:01:09,429
Do I have to buy a lockpick every time?

442
01:01:09,989 --> 01:01:11,510
So I don't get to reuse it?

443
01:01:12,230 --> 01:01:12,869
Oh, man.

444
01:01:12,869 --> 01:01:14,309
That's where the money sink is, huh?

445
01:01:25,940 --> 01:01:27,539
Oh, shit.

446
01:01:35,980 --> 01:01:37,260
Can I pawn those?

447
01:01:37,260 --> 01:01:40,170
Can I pawn those?

448
01:01:40,170 --> 01:01:41,530
Hold on. Wait, wait, wait.

449
01:01:41,530 --> 01:01:42,170
Wait. Oh, there.

450
01:01:42,170 --> 01:01:44,170
Anybody need any lockpicks?

451
01:01:44,809 --> 01:01:46,380
I've got this great idea.

452
01:01:46,380 --> 01:01:51,579
It's called buy, buy, buy shit at premium price.

453
01:01:51,579 --> 01:01:53,820
Sell for undercut price.

454
01:01:59,210 --> 01:02:00,699
God.

455
01:02:00,699 --> 01:02:03,179
You need to lock the pin while it's at the bottom.

456
01:02:06,789 --> 01:02:08,070
So how do you lock the pin?

457
01:02:08,070 --> 01:02:08,949
What button do you press?

458
01:02:09,750 --> 01:02:10,389
Well, here we go.

459
01:02:11,190 --> 01:02:13,510
Use a lockpick to open standard locks.

460
01:02:13,510 --> 01:02:16,630
Press the button at the exact time when a pin is at the bottom.

461
01:02:17,190 --> 01:02:18,260
Okay.

462
01:02:20,389 --> 01:02:21,269
But first of all,

463
01:02:21,269 --> 01:02:23,750
let me just try to get a super sweet candy crush here.

464
01:02:29,380 --> 01:02:29,860
Sweet.

465
01:02:38,309 --> 01:02:38,789
Lock the pin.

466
01:02:40,309 --> 01:02:44,900
I have to press S when it's at the bottom, right?

467
01:02:44,900 --> 01:02:45,780
That's what I just did.

468
01:02:45,780 --> 01:02:46,420
Have to click.

469
01:02:57,619 --> 01:02:58,500
Mouse zero.

470
01:02:59,059 --> 01:03:02,760
Okay. So it's mouse zero.

471
01:03:03,559 --> 01:03:07,050
That's a strange way to call it.

472
01:03:14,760 --> 01:03:17,559
If it ain't broke, fix it with a crowbar.

473
01:03:18,539 --> 01:03:23,739
Word on the street is the toilet in Greenview 113 is not broke.

474
01:03:25,860 --> 01:03:26,260
Really?

475
01:03:28,300 --> 01:03:29,260
Break the toilet.

476
01:03:31,139 --> 01:03:33,139
What is this petty bullshit?

477
01:03:33,860 --> 01:03:38,099
I feel like I'm being contacted by like ex-boyfriends and ex-girlfriends.

478
01:03:38,099 --> 01:03:39,699
I go in there and smash her toilet.

479
01:03:40,500 --> 01:03:43,110
Go pee on his TV.

480
01:03:43,829 --> 01:03:52,059
Am I a thief or am I like petty revenge guy?

481
01:03:52,699 --> 01:03:54,980
All right.

482
01:03:54,980 --> 01:03:56,500
So I got home.

483
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:57,619
Let me, I want to look at this.

484
01:03:59,980 --> 01:04:01,340
Go pee in his toilet.

485
01:04:01,340 --> 01:04:02,699
Yeah. Go pee in his toilet.

486
01:04:02,699 --> 01:04:04,940
All right. We got one, 113.

487
01:04:04,940 --> 01:04:05,980
Possible loot location.

488
01:04:05,980 --> 01:04:07,019
Let's see.

489
01:04:07,019 --> 01:04:09,500
There is a printer worth a lot in the living room.

490
01:04:09,500 --> 01:04:12,619
These houses are so small at this point in the game that this is, why would I do this?

491
01:04:13,179 --> 01:04:16,019
No one is there between nine and two.

492
01:04:17,989 --> 01:04:20,789
And there's a spare key for the front door in the bedroom.

493
01:04:20,789 --> 01:04:23,480
So between, let's get there at 9 a.m.

494
01:04:23,480 --> 01:04:24,599
And let's get the printer.

495
01:04:40,760 --> 01:04:42,119
Steal the printer ink.

496
01:04:42,119 --> 01:04:43,159
That's worth a lot of money.

497
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:50,949
So we're going to take the printer and then we're going to break the toilet.

498
01:04:58,019 --> 01:04:59,300
There's hiring people to prank.

499
01:04:59,940 --> 01:05:08,949
Did I even pick anything up for my inventory?

500
01:05:08,949 --> 01:05:09,429
Items.

501
01:05:12,469 --> 01:05:13,349
I don't have anything.

502
01:05:15,659 --> 01:05:15,980
All right.

503
01:05:15,980 --> 01:05:18,780
So 113 is the other house that's up on the hill there.

504
01:05:22,070 --> 01:05:25,750
Spend $200 on hints to get $70 for a printer.

505
01:05:26,550 --> 01:05:28,809
Yeah. Well, I just, that's fine.

506
01:05:30,550 --> 01:05:46,599
No, I don't want to get arrested.

507
01:05:46,599 --> 01:05:47,800
I want a perfect record.

508
01:05:55,130 --> 01:05:59,389
Nice.

509
01:06:14,070 --> 01:06:14,710
Nice steal.

510
01:06:20,489 --> 01:06:21,289
I don't want to be arrested.

511
01:06:21,289 --> 01:06:23,130
Drive straight into the stranger's backyard.

512
01:06:23,929 --> 01:06:27,539
Well, then they shouldn't put a jump there.

513
01:06:28,179 --> 01:06:30,519
If they don't want people to try to go off the jump,

514
01:06:30,519 --> 01:06:31,960
then there shouldn't be a jump available.

515
01:06:40,409 --> 01:06:41,769
Look, I'm being very careful now.

516
01:06:42,489 --> 01:06:54,300
All right.

517
01:06:54,300 --> 01:06:56,380
I need to park this car somewhere where no one's going to care.

518
01:07:02,309 --> 01:07:03,670
No one's going to walk over here.

519
01:07:03,670 --> 01:07:07,610
So all right.

520
01:07:07,610 --> 01:07:11,690
So between 9 a.m., no one's there right now until 2.

521
01:07:12,250 --> 01:07:16,409
We've got a printer in the living room and we have to smash the toilet.

522
01:07:16,409 --> 01:07:18,650
So I got a window.

523
01:07:21,510 --> 01:07:22,630
And I think I'm going to, I'm good.

524
01:07:22,630 --> 01:07:23,750
Nobody's here to see this.

525
01:07:27,050 --> 01:07:28,170
Oh, man.

526
01:07:31,340 --> 01:07:32,460
Where's the toilet?

527
01:07:32,460 --> 01:07:33,260
Where's the toilet?

528
01:07:34,469 --> 01:07:34,949
Where is it?

529
01:07:38,019 --> 01:07:41,900
Where's the, where's the living room?

530
01:07:51,030 --> 01:07:51,989
Get out.

531
01:07:51,989 --> 01:07:52,469
Get out.

532
01:07:55,530 --> 01:07:56,010
Put it down.

533
01:07:56,010 --> 01:07:56,250
Put it down.

534
01:07:56,250 --> 01:07:57,449
Put it down.

535
01:07:58,659 --> 01:07:59,539
Pick it up.

536
01:07:59,539 --> 01:08:00,900
Why can't I pick the TV up?

537
01:08:01,860 --> 01:08:02,820
Pick up the TV.

538
01:08:12,199 --> 01:08:14,360
That's the alarm.

539
01:08:22,680 --> 01:08:23,239
Oh, shit.

540
01:08:48,260 --> 01:08:48,739
There he is.

541
01:08:50,010 --> 01:08:52,489
No, that's a wooden person.

542
01:08:53,850 --> 01:09:03,909
It's just an outlast.

543
01:09:06,840 --> 01:09:07,319
9 a.m.

544
01:09:07,319 --> 01:09:08,039
2 p.m., right?

545
01:09:08,039 --> 01:09:10,920
We got like three hours to get out of here.

546
01:09:20,819 --> 01:09:22,659
Tie shoelaces together.

547
01:09:22,659 --> 01:09:24,470
All right.

548
01:09:24,470 --> 01:09:25,270
We're good.

549
01:09:25,270 --> 01:09:30,979
Now what about toys?

550
01:09:30,979 --> 01:09:31,300
Okay.

551
01:09:31,300 --> 01:09:31,699
Living room.

552
01:09:31,699 --> 01:09:32,420
Find the living room.

553
01:09:38,140 --> 01:09:39,180
I need like the living room.

554
01:09:44,729 --> 01:09:52,659
Where's the printer?

555
01:09:52,659 --> 01:09:53,779
Holy shit, the thing's huge.

556
01:10:08,760 --> 01:10:10,199
How do I get it out here?

557
01:10:10,199 --> 01:10:11,479
Can I get it out of this window?

558
01:10:13,850 --> 01:10:14,329
Fuck.

559
01:10:14,329 --> 01:10:15,369
Oh, they're coming back.

560
01:10:15,369 --> 01:10:16,010
They're coming back.

561
01:10:16,010 --> 01:10:16,489
They're coming back.

562
01:10:16,489 --> 01:10:17,770
Get back out of the bed.

563
01:10:17,770 --> 01:10:18,409
Get out of the bed.

564
01:10:28,340 --> 01:10:34,680
So I got the front door.

565
01:10:34,680 --> 01:10:50,329
I can't fit through there.

566
01:10:50,329 --> 01:10:56,840
Can't fit through here though, apparently.

567
01:10:56,840 --> 01:10:57,880
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

568
01:10:57,880 --> 01:10:58,199
Hint.

569
01:10:58,199 --> 01:11:00,279
There's a spare key for the front door on the bedroom.

570
01:11:00,279 --> 01:11:14,199
Time is it?

571
01:11:14,199 --> 01:11:22,420
Oh, that's a guitar.

572
01:11:22,420 --> 01:11:27,079
Let's see.

573
01:11:27,079 --> 01:11:27,560
Oh, shit.

574
01:11:27,560 --> 01:11:29,319
These are vases and shit.

575
01:11:29,319 --> 01:11:29,479
Okay.

576
01:11:29,479 --> 01:11:29,960
What time is it?

577
01:11:29,960 --> 01:11:30,279
Got to go.

578
01:11:30,840 --> 01:11:32,819
Okay.

579
01:11:33,380 --> 01:11:33,859
Got to go.

580
01:11:33,859 --> 01:11:34,579
What is this?

581
01:11:34,579 --> 01:11:35,140
A camera.

582
01:11:35,140 --> 01:11:35,859
Worth a lot of money.

583
01:11:35,859 --> 01:11:36,819
Can't take it.

584
01:11:36,819 --> 01:11:37,220
Move.

585
01:11:37,220 --> 01:11:38,260
Oh, oh, they're coming back.

586
01:11:38,979 --> 01:11:40,760
I can't even take money?

587
01:11:41,399 --> 01:11:41,640
All right.

588
01:11:41,640 --> 01:11:42,199
Where's the printer?

589
01:11:59,289 --> 01:12:00,729
Get it in the car quick.

590
01:12:01,609 --> 01:12:02,649
Get it in the car.

591
01:12:04,460 --> 01:12:05,979
I can't sprint with this thing.

592
01:12:05,979 --> 01:12:06,699
It's too heavy.

593
01:12:10,649 --> 01:12:11,050
All right.

594
01:12:11,050 --> 01:12:11,369
Open.

595
01:12:22,329 --> 01:12:23,609
And I'm out of here.

596
01:12:24,250 --> 01:12:26,250
That's how you do it.

597
01:12:26,250 --> 01:12:31,260
What about the TV?

598
01:12:31,260 --> 01:12:32,619
I can't put the TV in there, man.

599
01:12:36,149 --> 01:12:36,789
That's all right.

600
01:12:44,710 --> 01:12:46,710
Like a man spider, you know?

601
01:12:48,149 --> 01:12:48,789
Oh, I know.

602
01:12:51,020 --> 01:12:52,220
First, let me see something here.

603
01:12:53,989 --> 01:12:58,550
Car parts, electronics, microwave, radio, kitchen.

604
01:12:58,550 --> 01:13:01,829
Other is the guitar.

605
01:13:02,979 --> 01:13:03,699
300 bucks.

606
01:13:06,090 --> 01:13:07,850
So I have to bring the printer to the pawn shop?

607
01:13:11,510 --> 01:13:12,149
Rent a thug.

608
01:13:12,149 --> 01:13:12,710
All right.

609
01:13:12,710 --> 01:13:14,069
Break or steal the painting.

610
01:13:14,869 --> 01:13:16,789
Break or steal the kiss painting.

611
01:13:21,460 --> 01:13:23,380
So that's like, that's teeth.

612
01:13:23,380 --> 01:13:25,300
That's just an x-ray of somebody biting down.

613
01:13:27,300 --> 01:13:27,779
All right.

614
01:13:27,779 --> 01:13:30,579
Um, let's, let's stay with the tutorial here though.

615
01:13:32,539 --> 01:13:34,699
So learn agility level two.

616
01:13:38,569 --> 01:13:40,010
Here's agility.

617
01:13:40,010 --> 01:13:40,970
Agility one.

618
01:13:41,770 --> 01:13:42,970
Throw bricks.

619
01:13:46,300 --> 01:13:47,420
I don't, I don't need to care.

620
01:13:47,420 --> 01:13:48,380
I don't care about anything else.

621
01:13:54,439 --> 01:13:54,760
All right.

622
01:13:54,760 --> 01:13:55,159
Let's go.

623
01:13:56,550 --> 01:13:57,989
Let's go throw bricks at stuff.

624
01:14:00,550 --> 01:14:02,550
So we got rent a thug.

625
01:14:02,550 --> 01:14:04,069
So break the painting.

626
01:14:04,949 --> 01:14:06,470
We'll just break them all.

627
01:14:06,470 --> 01:14:08,069
One 10, one 12 smack.

628
01:14:08,069 --> 01:14:09,350
Just break their paintings.

629
01:14:10,520 --> 01:14:11,479
Now, can I buy a brick?

630
01:14:14,489 --> 01:14:15,609
Is brick available?

631
01:14:26,279 --> 01:14:27,560
So let me get this out of here.

632
01:14:30,279 --> 01:14:30,760
Sell this.

633
01:14:34,760 --> 01:14:36,279
What can I buy a brick?

634
01:14:36,279 --> 01:14:37,800
It's a, it's a pretty good question, right?

635
01:14:52,939 --> 01:14:53,340
Okay.

636
01:14:53,340 --> 01:14:58,600
I wish you could open the door.

637
01:14:58,600 --> 01:14:59,319
Welcome back.

638
01:15:03,300 --> 01:15:03,779
Favorites.

639
01:15:06,520 --> 01:15:07,159
Oh damn.

640
01:15:10,600 --> 01:15:10,840
Okay.

641
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:11,800
Well, that was a lot of money.

642
01:15:12,899 --> 01:15:13,140
All right.

643
01:15:13,140 --> 01:15:14,100
Let's go break stuff.

644
01:15:14,659 --> 01:15:20,220
Uh, do we have any Intel on one?

645
01:15:21,380 --> 01:15:22,260
There's one 10.

646
01:15:30,090 --> 01:15:30,890
My trunk is open.

647
01:15:30,890 --> 01:15:31,850
It's all right.

648
01:15:31,850 --> 01:15:34,069
It'll be fine.

649
01:15:34,630 --> 01:15:35,500
Don't worry.

650
01:15:37,779 --> 01:15:38,180
All right.

651
01:15:38,180 --> 01:15:45,779
So, uh, we need to go to one 10 and one 12 and break this, the paintings or steal them.

652
01:15:46,420 --> 01:15:48,489
Do we have Intel on the people there?

653
01:15:50,920 --> 01:15:53,000
Let's see if I have any Intel on one 10.

654
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:53,239
All right.

655
01:15:53,239 --> 01:15:54,359
I need to like park this.

656
01:15:54,359 --> 01:15:55,479
There's a parking garage right here.

657
01:15:56,279 --> 01:16:20,420
All right.

658
01:16:20,420 --> 01:16:21,060
One 10.

659
01:16:21,699 --> 01:16:23,560
Let's see.

660
01:16:23,560 --> 01:16:24,039
We got me.

661
01:16:24,039 --> 01:16:24,920
This is one 11.

662
01:16:25,560 --> 01:16:27,130
This guy not home.

663
01:16:27,770 --> 01:16:29,720
We're one 10.

664
01:16:29,720 --> 01:16:30,119
Let's go.

665
01:16:30,119 --> 01:16:30,920
I'm going to go over on the back.

666
01:16:35,100 --> 01:16:36,460
I can't, I can't climb this.

667
01:16:37,180 --> 01:16:43,399
I mean, there are no bricks.

668
01:16:43,399 --> 01:16:44,439
I can't throw anything.

669
01:16:45,930 --> 01:16:46,970
There's a guy home.

670
01:16:46,970 --> 01:16:48,170
I don't even know if this guy's home.

671
01:16:50,100 --> 01:16:51,220
What if he's open his door?

672
01:16:51,220 --> 01:17:14,819
Is he going, oh, why are they coming over here?

673
01:17:39,939 --> 01:17:41,140
They're not going to come all the way over here.

674
01:17:42,390 --> 01:17:45,109
And if they do, I think their AI is not going to be smart enough.

675
01:17:45,109 --> 01:17:46,949
They're going to run right by me and turn around and run back.

676
01:17:47,670 --> 01:17:49,619
I'm like wedged up into the wall.

677
01:17:49,619 --> 01:17:52,460
See, I'm going to get caught here.

678
01:17:52,460 --> 01:17:53,020
Definitely.

679
01:17:53,020 --> 01:17:54,380
I don't, I don't think so, man.

680
01:17:54,939 --> 01:17:56,060
I think we're good.

681
01:17:56,060 --> 01:18:06,170
I'm hiding like a child.

682
01:18:07,779 --> 01:18:10,979
Hey, sometimes the simplest of techniques is the most effective.

683
01:18:22,090 --> 01:18:23,210
All right, go on and get out of here.

684
01:18:29,529 --> 01:18:30,649
The painting's right there.

685
01:18:36,340 --> 01:18:37,539
Get out of here.

686
01:18:37,539 --> 01:18:37,859
Why?

687
01:18:38,579 --> 01:18:43,060
Hey, look, I'm going to do signals.

688
01:18:50,699 --> 01:18:51,500
One of them gave up.

689
01:18:52,060 --> 01:19:00,569
They only have one thief in town.

690
01:19:00,569 --> 01:19:01,130
All right.

691
01:19:01,130 --> 01:19:04,569
That, what is happening right now?

692
01:19:04,569 --> 01:19:06,489
Two gave up.

693
01:19:06,489 --> 01:19:07,130
There's the third one.

694
01:19:07,130 --> 01:19:08,729
Why is the third one not giving up?

695
01:19:08,729 --> 01:19:10,010
In fact, I have an opportunity here.

696
01:19:10,970 --> 01:19:12,090
I need to see if anyone's here.

697
01:19:12,970 --> 01:19:18,550
I don't see anybody in here.

698
01:19:19,189 --> 01:19:22,140
And in the bathroom, maybe?

699
01:19:22,939 --> 01:19:24,869
But I have to smash this.

700
01:19:25,670 --> 01:19:33,270
Well, it is, what the fuck?

701
01:19:33,270 --> 01:19:33,989
Get out of here.

702
01:19:39,180 --> 01:19:41,420
Is this going to, what are they, how can,

703
01:19:41,420 --> 01:19:42,779
how can you tell if a place has an alarm?

704
01:19:43,420 --> 01:19:48,140
Why are they walking?

705
01:19:48,140 --> 01:19:49,579
Oh, to go into their house.

706
01:19:51,350 --> 01:19:52,470
Oh, no.

707
01:19:52,470 --> 01:19:53,270
This is their house.

708
01:19:58,659 --> 01:20:00,100
No, is it, or are they just on the road?

709
01:20:04,020 --> 01:20:04,739
They won't leave.

710
01:20:16,460 --> 01:20:21,800
Where's my car?

711
01:20:22,439 --> 01:20:24,810
Where's my car?

712
01:20:24,810 --> 01:20:37,609
I think we're in the clear.

713
01:20:37,609 --> 01:20:38,090
There it is.

714
01:20:38,090 --> 01:20:38,329
Okay.

715
01:20:39,050 --> 01:20:44,949
All right, I need one, 111 is this unknown.

716
01:20:45,670 --> 01:20:48,779
I need to go to 112 and do the same thing.

717
01:20:51,930 --> 01:20:53,689
Don't walk past people's windows.

718
01:20:53,689 --> 01:20:54,569
What am I, stupid?

719
01:20:56,220 --> 01:20:57,260
All right, police are gone.

720
01:20:59,579 --> 01:21:02,060
The same shit happened last time and I got stuck back here.

721
01:21:02,699 --> 01:21:06,149
What is this here for?

722
01:21:06,149 --> 01:21:07,829
See, this is, I told you, there's a jump here.

723
01:21:08,390 --> 01:21:19,529
There's a guy right there.

724
01:21:19,529 --> 01:21:20,489
All right, what is this?

725
01:21:20,489 --> 01:21:21,529
Electricity?

726
01:21:21,529 --> 01:21:25,619
I have to go all the way around.

727
01:21:31,699 --> 01:21:32,500
I can get intel, right?

728
01:21:33,220 --> 01:21:37,930
I got a new routine.

729
01:21:38,810 --> 01:21:46,460
Just put it down, put it down.

730
01:22:07,479 --> 01:22:09,640
I'm under arrest?

731
01:22:09,640 --> 01:22:11,640
Well, I feel like it could have outran you

732
01:22:11,640 --> 01:22:13,560
after you flipped over your fucking squad car.

733
01:22:21,670 --> 01:22:22,949
Where, where is this?

734
01:22:23,670 --> 01:22:25,479
No, it was just right there.

735
01:22:26,119 --> 01:22:34,010
All right, so we got, we got a couple of jobs.

736
01:22:34,010 --> 01:22:34,489
Job.

737
01:22:36,119 --> 01:22:37,960
Let's go to break the, let's go to one.

738
01:22:37,960 --> 01:22:39,640
The other one's more expensive anyways.

739
01:22:40,199 --> 01:22:41,079
112.

740
01:22:42,819 --> 01:22:43,859
You can steal it too.

741
01:22:44,579 --> 01:22:50,149
You're under arrest.

742
01:22:50,869 --> 01:22:54,569
You did 112.

743
01:22:55,210 --> 01:22:56,329
I didn't steal a painting.

744
01:22:57,130 --> 01:23:03,800
I need to like go up there.

745
01:23:27,500 --> 01:23:28,619
No, I can mark this person.

746
01:23:29,180 --> 01:23:29,899
Wait, hold on.

747
01:23:29,899 --> 01:23:31,260
Why can't I see these people through the walls?

748
01:23:31,260 --> 01:23:34,340
There's a spare key for the front door.

749
01:23:34,340 --> 01:23:34,659
Okay.

750
01:23:37,479 --> 01:23:38,760
Well, I know that whole routine.

751
01:23:39,899 --> 01:23:40,460
112.

752
01:23:40,460 --> 01:23:40,939
Here we go.

753
01:23:41,739 --> 01:23:47,420
Break or steal the kiss.

754
01:23:47,420 --> 01:23:48,779
But it's 150 bucks for this.

755
01:23:49,500 --> 01:23:51,960
Oh, they're both there.

756
01:23:51,960 --> 01:23:53,399
I wonder if I can get a routine here.

757
01:23:54,039 --> 01:24:00,100
Well, the painting's in there.

758
01:24:01,140 --> 01:24:02,659
I could bust the lock, steal the painting

759
01:24:02,659 --> 01:24:03,859
and get out scott free.

760
01:24:08,729 --> 01:24:09,529
They're okay.

761
01:24:09,529 --> 01:24:11,210
Look at how long they're in the bedroom here for though.

762
01:24:12,600 --> 01:24:14,039
See if I can pick them when they're.

763
01:24:14,680 --> 01:24:18,460
Because if they're in the bedroom for that long,

764
01:24:18,460 --> 01:24:20,619
I can pop the lock, go grab the painting

765
01:24:20,619 --> 01:24:21,020
and get out.

766
01:24:21,659 --> 01:24:24,100
But they're at the end of it here.

767
01:24:24,100 --> 01:24:25,060
It's probably a bad idea.

768
01:24:30,569 --> 01:24:31,529
Yeah, they're about to be out.

769
01:24:32,250 --> 01:24:34,739
Should I go for it?

770
01:24:35,300 --> 01:24:38,680
I'm going for it.

771
01:24:58,439 --> 01:24:58,840
I didn't.

772
01:24:58,840 --> 01:25:00,039
I was looking at chat.

773
01:25:00,039 --> 01:25:01,000
Why would I do that?

774
01:25:13,270 --> 01:25:14,229
Give me the molar painting.

775
01:25:14,229 --> 01:25:15,829
Give me like the fucking chew impression.

776
01:25:21,270 --> 01:25:21,590
What?

777
01:25:25,560 --> 01:25:25,800
What?

778
01:25:43,500 --> 01:25:44,859
Oh, oh, which way are they going?

779
01:25:44,859 --> 01:25:45,739
Which way are they going?

780
01:25:45,739 --> 01:25:51,130
I think I can make it.

781
01:25:51,130 --> 01:25:54,729
I think I can make it.

782
01:26:16,539 --> 01:26:17,020
See ya.

783
01:26:38,100 --> 01:26:39,140
And I got the painting.

784
01:26:39,140 --> 01:26:45,369
I just walked an antique painting.

785
01:26:45,369 --> 01:26:47,609
I just walked a full couch through the neighborhood.

786
01:26:51,859 --> 01:26:52,180
Really?

787
01:26:53,319 --> 01:26:55,079
I would give that an A.

788
01:26:55,079 --> 01:26:58,380
But the amount of preparation and dodging and weaving

789
01:26:58,380 --> 01:27:00,460
and that was not an F.

790
01:27:00,460 --> 01:27:01,020
I'm sorry.

791
01:27:06,680 --> 01:27:06,920
All right.

792
01:27:06,920 --> 01:27:08,439
Should I pawn this or should I sell it here?

793
01:27:11,800 --> 01:27:13,590
Art.

794
01:27:13,590 --> 01:27:19,420
Well, it's not under art.

795
01:27:19,420 --> 01:27:20,140
Antiques.

796
01:27:20,140 --> 01:27:20,539
Other.

797
01:27:20,539 --> 01:27:20,939
Kitchen.

798
01:27:21,829 --> 01:27:22,630
Electronics.

799
01:27:22,630 --> 01:27:23,189
Car parts.

800
01:27:23,189 --> 01:27:23,510
Yeah.

801
01:27:24,390 --> 01:27:24,710
All right.

802
01:27:25,350 --> 01:27:27,350
So I did it.

803
01:27:27,350 --> 01:27:28,630
I actually still am on that one.

804
01:27:28,630 --> 01:27:29,270
I got to pawn this.

805
01:27:30,069 --> 01:27:38,619
I wonder what it's worth.

806
01:27:39,340 --> 01:27:41,180
I'm going to say 500 bucks.

807
01:27:42,140 --> 01:27:45,689
Scroll down.

808
01:27:45,689 --> 01:27:46,409
I did scroll.

809
01:27:46,409 --> 01:27:47,529
I got to the bottom of the scroll.

810
01:27:48,579 --> 01:27:49,380
Welcome back.

811
01:27:53,020 --> 01:27:56,300
Well, it's 150 dollars to break the damn thing.

812
01:27:56,300 --> 01:27:57,500
Go through all the trouble of stealing.

813
01:27:57,500 --> 01:27:58,779
It has to be something worth doing.

814
01:28:18,170 --> 01:28:18,970
All right.

815
01:28:18,970 --> 01:28:22,779
Apparently not.

816
01:28:22,779 --> 01:28:23,020
All right.

817
01:28:23,020 --> 01:28:24,380
I need agility level two.

818
01:28:25,100 --> 01:28:26,970
Required level six.

819
01:28:27,770 --> 01:28:30,949
I just have to just keep stealing things?

820
01:28:35,529 --> 01:28:36,890
That's on top of the 150?

821
01:28:37,770 --> 01:28:38,649
Yeah, it probably is.

822
01:28:55,029 --> 01:28:55,430
All right.

823
01:28:56,390 --> 01:28:58,229
The only thing I can do here is either just...

824
01:28:58,229 --> 01:28:59,829
I can just go into random people's houses.

825
01:29:01,159 --> 01:29:01,399
Right?

826
01:29:02,119 --> 01:29:03,939
What's stopping me from doing that?

827
01:29:04,579 --> 01:29:20,250
What about 106?

828
01:29:20,250 --> 01:29:21,289
Let's just case this place.

829
01:29:25,590 --> 01:29:26,470
Unknown.

830
01:29:26,470 --> 01:29:33,930
I can't mark you.

831
01:29:33,930 --> 01:29:34,970
I can see you right through the door.

832
01:29:35,770 --> 01:29:41,819
Somebody coming down the street.

833
01:29:41,819 --> 01:29:42,939
What are you doing out this late?

834
01:29:43,500 --> 01:29:44,140
Get out of here.

835
01:29:44,779 --> 01:29:47,420
Why are you even on the road?

836
01:29:48,140 --> 01:29:53,819
Ring the doorbell.

837
01:29:54,619 --> 01:30:23,609
Got you.

838
01:30:27,420 --> 01:30:28,460
What happened to this person?

839
01:30:28,460 --> 01:30:33,180
What is this person doing?

840
01:30:33,180 --> 01:30:34,619
Oh, they're going to sleep.

841
01:30:34,619 --> 01:30:36,500
All right.

842
01:30:36,500 --> 01:30:37,539
I got you.

843
01:30:37,539 --> 01:30:40,939
So you are in the kitchen.

844
01:30:40,939 --> 01:30:41,180
You're...

845
01:30:41,180 --> 01:30:41,420
Okay.

846
01:30:41,420 --> 01:30:42,460
So he's in there for a while.

847
01:30:43,590 --> 01:30:45,829
They're both incapacitated for a little while here.

848
01:30:45,829 --> 01:30:49,319
This person is very restless.

849
01:30:49,319 --> 01:30:49,720
All right.

850
01:30:49,720 --> 01:30:51,239
Let's get in here through the...

851
01:30:51,880 --> 01:31:03,050
Keep an eye on that minimap for me.

852
01:31:03,689 --> 01:31:09,159
What the fuck are you doing?

853
01:31:17,739 --> 01:31:19,899
The blue is when they're not doing...

854
01:31:19,899 --> 01:31:20,140
Really?

855
01:31:20,779 --> 01:31:25,109
No, it looks like we're going to 107.

856
01:31:25,829 --> 01:31:32,569
The Wilsons have a huge house.

857
01:31:36,630 --> 01:31:37,670
Just climb over the fence?

858
01:31:37,670 --> 01:31:38,869
See, I can't.

859
01:31:38,869 --> 01:31:40,789
I don't know how to use a fence.

860
01:31:44,390 --> 01:31:47,590
Not until I level up, like, one more time in agility.

861
01:31:47,590 --> 01:31:48,710
I can't use a fence.

862
01:31:49,430 --> 01:31:52,680
I think it's an intel, though.

863
01:31:55,909 --> 01:31:57,510
Any other intel for 107?

864
01:32:04,439 --> 01:32:06,119
I think there's only one way in to 107.

865
01:32:06,840 --> 01:32:10,439
Through the front door?

866
01:32:11,239 --> 01:32:15,939
I can't, like, take the mail?

867
01:32:16,659 --> 01:32:20,600
All right.

868
01:32:20,600 --> 01:32:21,079
I'm going to wait.

869
01:32:22,470 --> 01:32:23,350
Anybody right here?

870
01:32:23,350 --> 01:32:27,590
I need to wait till you walk by.

871
01:32:27,590 --> 01:32:29,109
Just walk by so I can open this.

872
01:32:29,829 --> 01:32:36,329
What's it blinking to?

873
01:32:36,329 --> 01:32:37,289
It's easy to climb the fence.

874
01:32:37,289 --> 01:32:37,850
Yeah, yeah.

875
01:32:39,560 --> 01:32:40,760
Stealing mail is illegal.

876
01:32:41,399 --> 01:32:44,520
Um, so is smashing windows, taking paintings,

877
01:32:45,319 --> 01:32:46,680
and throwing bricks at people.

878
01:32:47,319 --> 01:32:49,899
Okay.

879
01:32:49,899 --> 01:32:53,420
Opportunity is arising right now.

880
01:32:54,140 --> 01:33:28,180
Getting gnomed.

881
01:33:29,140 --> 01:33:32,140
They have all their blinds closed.

882
01:33:34,970 --> 01:33:36,569
You know, this is probably a mission to do that.

883
01:33:36,569 --> 01:33:37,050
All right, here we go.

884
01:33:37,050 --> 01:33:37,609
Back door.

885
01:33:38,170 --> 01:33:39,609
I need luck picking three.

886
01:33:39,609 --> 01:33:41,210
This house is secure.

887
01:33:44,520 --> 01:33:45,399
No, so is this.

888
01:33:45,960 --> 01:33:47,720
All right, well, just take all the cool stuff

889
01:33:47,720 --> 01:33:48,600
they have in their backyard.

890
01:33:51,060 --> 01:33:52,100
Well, I'll take that.

891
01:33:52,100 --> 01:33:52,819
15 bucks.

892
01:33:52,819 --> 01:33:53,539
We got a radio.

893
01:33:55,960 --> 01:33:56,359
Wine.

894
01:33:57,079 --> 01:33:59,130
A couple of nice wines.

895
01:34:03,750 --> 01:34:04,470
On the grill.

896
01:34:05,029 --> 01:34:10,329
I want to whip a brick through that window.

897
01:34:10,329 --> 01:34:10,810
So bad.

898
01:34:11,529 --> 01:34:13,750
That's it, right?

899
01:34:17,300 --> 01:34:17,939
What if I do this?

900
01:34:18,739 --> 01:34:23,449
Can I annoy them enough?

901
01:34:23,449 --> 01:34:24,409
Were they going to open the door?

902
01:34:24,970 --> 01:34:31,449
I can't get in here.

903
01:34:32,869 --> 01:34:34,069
Leave mud here.

904
01:34:35,130 --> 01:34:36,010
Where's their doorbell?

905
01:34:36,649 --> 01:34:37,770
Are they smart and they don't have one?

906
01:34:38,329 --> 01:34:40,260
Where's your doorbell?

907
01:34:45,510 --> 01:34:47,380
Fine.

908
01:34:47,380 --> 01:34:48,340
Throw a brick.

909
01:34:48,340 --> 01:34:50,100
There is no brick.

910
01:34:50,100 --> 01:34:51,300
Do you see a brick anywhere?

911
01:34:54,460 --> 01:34:55,659
How do I throw a brick?

912
01:35:04,939 --> 01:35:05,819
Throw gnome.

913
01:35:06,539 --> 01:35:08,300
I, I don't have anything.

914
01:35:08,939 --> 01:35:18,300
The key definitely under the mat.

915
01:35:19,020 --> 01:35:20,619
Well, I, I can't get it.

916
01:35:27,350 --> 01:35:28,550
Yeah, this house is locked up.

917
01:35:32,579 --> 01:35:33,859
Holy fuck, that guy could see.

918
01:35:33,859 --> 01:35:34,819
All right, what about over here?

919
01:35:37,210 --> 01:35:38,489
I gotta go craft a brick.

920
01:35:41,189 --> 01:35:44,470
I need, I need to just steal a few more things.

921
01:35:44,470 --> 01:35:45,029
All right, here we go.

922
01:35:45,029 --> 01:35:45,590
104.

923
01:35:48,090 --> 01:35:48,810
Nobody around.

924
01:35:49,449 --> 01:35:54,520
What's over in the corner?

925
01:35:54,520 --> 01:35:55,079
That's mail.

926
01:35:55,880 --> 01:35:56,840
All right, the people that are in,

927
01:35:56,840 --> 01:35:57,720
people are sleeping in here.

928
01:35:57,720 --> 01:35:58,199
What time is it?

929
01:35:58,680 --> 01:35:59,800
It's 2 a.m.

930
01:36:00,439 --> 01:36:03,180
Level three lockpick.

931
01:36:03,819 --> 01:36:04,779
What the fuck?

932
01:36:04,779 --> 01:36:14,920
Is that level three?

933
01:36:23,159 --> 01:36:23,560
Nope.

934
01:36:23,560 --> 01:36:24,680
No, it's level three.

935
01:36:24,680 --> 01:36:42,420
Shit.

936
01:36:42,420 --> 01:36:42,979
Shit.

937
01:36:42,979 --> 01:36:54,140
I was trying to go in with them.

938
01:37:07,939 --> 01:37:09,060
I can open this one.

939
01:37:09,060 --> 01:37:22,199
So I can't do any of these houses.

940
01:37:22,199 --> 01:37:24,600
I need like level three lockpicking to even do with them.

941
01:37:24,600 --> 01:37:30,260
I need like other tools.

942
01:37:30,260 --> 01:37:31,140
All right, I have to stay away.

943
01:37:31,140 --> 01:37:35,319
I gotta go to like 101 through 103, apparently.

944
01:37:35,319 --> 01:37:42,819
Because I really only have one thing to do.

945
01:37:43,930 --> 01:37:55,210
I have, the job that I have is steal the painting in 110.

946
01:37:55,210 --> 01:37:56,090
That's 50 bucks.

947
01:37:56,729 --> 01:37:59,020
I don't have any other jobs to do.

948
01:37:59,739 --> 01:38:00,619
All right, I took the loot there.

949
01:38:00,619 --> 01:38:02,220
I need to like case the places out, man.

950
01:38:02,220 --> 01:38:02,460
Let's see.

951
01:38:02,460 --> 01:38:03,260
Okay, 110.

952
01:38:03,260 --> 01:38:04,300
That's where I'm supposed, let's go.

953
01:38:04,939 --> 01:38:10,460
Let's make our kind of cheese.

954
01:38:11,829 --> 01:38:15,529
Um, I'm a big Swiss cheese kind of fan, but.

955
01:38:16,090 --> 01:38:20,439
You know, Havarti is really good.

956
01:38:21,159 --> 01:38:24,949
What am I answering this question?

957
01:38:25,670 --> 01:38:26,170
What?

958
01:38:32,729 --> 01:38:43,869
Yeah, no, Swiss cheese is great.

959
01:38:44,510 --> 01:38:48,560
All right, I just gotta break or steal the painting over here at 110.

960
01:38:49,279 --> 01:38:50,720
And then I would probably get more tasks.

961
01:38:55,420 --> 01:38:56,779
All right, break or steal the painting.

962
01:38:57,420 --> 01:39:04,319
The people are probably home right now because it is 9 30 p.m.

963
01:39:05,119 --> 01:39:09,050
I don't see anybody in this room standing.

964
01:39:10,989 --> 01:39:12,270
Oh, forget about the flashlight.

965
01:39:19,199 --> 01:39:21,439
Dude, can I just like learn how to climb the fence?

966
01:39:22,159 --> 01:39:27,520
I need to learn how to climb a fence.

967
01:39:28,159 --> 01:39:36,359
Because I, all right, we're going to the front door.

968
01:39:39,800 --> 01:39:42,010
Is somebody here?

969
01:39:42,010 --> 01:39:54,649
Just break it.

970
01:39:54,649 --> 01:40:02,720
All right, I did it.

971
01:40:02,720 --> 01:40:06,560
They're not even home.

972
01:40:08,140 --> 01:40:08,460
Got it.

973
01:40:09,720 --> 01:40:14,890
Okay, that was an original.

974
01:40:15,449 --> 01:40:17,529
You know, they shouldn't have had it displayed in the window.

975
01:40:18,170 --> 01:40:26,590
Why on earth would you display like a fucking million dollar painting right in the window?

976
01:40:29,979 --> 01:40:40,329
And you have single pane windows so people can see.

977
01:40:41,609 --> 01:40:49,500
All right, do I have anything to sell besides that?

978
01:40:49,500 --> 01:40:59,000
They can't afford any more window panes because they already bought the painting.

979
01:41:01,050 --> 01:41:01,770
Welcome back.

980
01:41:02,569 --> 01:41:03,449
I have no items.

981
01:41:06,399 --> 01:41:18,399
All right, is there anything else for me to take from the home?

982
01:41:18,399 --> 01:41:21,520
It was actually only a 50-dollar painting so that doesn't make any sense.

983
01:41:21,520 --> 01:41:24,479
But I mean, come on, if you have like an original Mona Lisa,

984
01:41:24,479 --> 01:41:30,640
if you had the Mona Lisa and you lived in a single level one bedroom

985
01:41:30,640 --> 01:41:32,720
with like 10 windows and you had it on your wall,

986
01:41:34,670 --> 01:41:38,590
like somebody is going to smash your window and take it.

987
01:41:38,590 --> 01:41:39,149
They just will.

988
01:41:39,949 --> 01:41:43,659
You need to have like a home alone style booby traps everywhere.

989
01:41:44,380 --> 01:41:53,439
Well, thanks for giving me more of your routine.

990
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,640
You wouldn't be living in that house if you had the Mona Lisa.

991
01:41:59,659 --> 01:42:01,899
Yeah, you know that that's 100% true.

992
01:42:05,390 --> 01:42:11,470
Like a 50 million dollar painting and you're in like a one bedroom in like a suburb somewhere.

993
01:42:16,720 --> 01:42:18,399
I'm obsessed with these houses.

994
01:42:19,039 --> 01:42:20,399
I got to get over these houses.

995
01:42:20,960 --> 01:42:30,890
I just need to start taking stuff.

996
01:42:30,890 --> 01:42:32,649
What about 103 and 102?

997
01:42:33,289 --> 01:42:35,149
I just need money.

998
01:42:35,149 --> 01:42:36,189
I just need experience.

999
01:42:36,989 --> 01:42:48,380
Does it learn to climb?

1000
01:42:49,600 --> 01:42:52,800
I have to do this before I get experience to learn to climb.

1001
01:42:53,600 --> 01:43:01,920
Okay, so we got this looks very elaborate.

1002
01:43:01,920 --> 01:43:02,800
Electronic door.

1003
01:43:04,239 --> 01:43:04,800
Lights are on.

1004
01:43:05,439 --> 01:43:08,079
Somebody's listening to music.

1005
01:43:15,899 --> 01:43:16,939
Anybody behind here?

1006
01:43:17,659 --> 01:43:24,329
No, they're not having like a backyard barbecue.

1007
01:43:24,970 --> 01:43:26,569
That's perfect for me to take whatever I want.

1008
01:43:27,289 --> 01:43:31,130
You don't have anything back here at all?

1009
01:43:32,189 --> 01:43:32,590
Nothing.

1010
01:43:33,819 --> 01:43:34,060
Shit.

1011
01:43:34,699 --> 01:43:41,550
Damn it.

1012
01:43:41,550 --> 01:43:48,140
Do I have to like break in the front door right now?

1013
01:43:51,760 --> 01:43:53,119
I can't even do that.

1014
01:43:53,119 --> 01:43:54,079
And they don't have a doorbell.

1015
01:43:54,970 --> 01:43:56,170
Well, this house is secure.

1016
01:43:56,890 --> 01:43:59,979
Mona Lisa would be do very well in there.

1017
01:44:00,619 --> 01:44:05,529
There's a person coming right now.

1018
01:44:05,529 --> 01:44:12,350
I don't think anybody needs to get home.

1019
01:44:19,340 --> 01:44:19,979
101.

1020
01:44:20,699 --> 01:44:23,100
How's 101?

1021
01:44:24,750 --> 01:44:25,869
Security cameras.

1022
01:44:29,260 --> 01:44:30,779
They got they got the whole thing set up here.

1023
01:44:30,779 --> 01:44:33,180
There's security here pointing this way.

1024
01:44:33,979 --> 01:44:35,550
Cameras in the front of the house.

1025
01:44:36,189 --> 01:44:42,399
All right.

1026
01:44:42,399 --> 01:44:43,949
Anybody in there?

1027
01:44:44,590 --> 01:44:53,789
You don't just have any trash I can take and sell?

1028
01:44:54,670 --> 01:44:59,720
Now you get on top of this.

1029
01:45:00,359 --> 01:45:01,399
Lockpicking level three.

1030
01:45:02,439 --> 01:45:05,399
All right, we have to go back to the other houses.

1031
01:45:05,399 --> 01:45:06,199
It's like 110.

1032
01:45:07,789 --> 01:45:10,189
I have to rob the same guy over and over again.

1033
01:45:10,909 --> 01:45:13,710
Or this one would open.

1034
01:45:15,920 --> 01:45:17,199
So sad.

1035
01:45:17,199 --> 01:45:19,279
I have to rob the same person?

1036
01:45:19,279 --> 01:45:22,880
Okay, I don't know where they are now.

1037
01:45:22,880 --> 01:45:24,960
But it is 2am.

1038
01:45:24,960 --> 01:45:25,840
They're probably asleep.

1039
01:45:26,560 --> 01:45:30,699
This guy's gonna walk right by.

1040
01:45:33,600 --> 01:45:35,840
This many pedestrians outside at two o'clock in the morning.

1041
01:45:37,199 --> 01:45:37,439
No.

1042
01:45:38,409 --> 01:45:39,289
Where the hell do we live?

1043
01:45:39,930 --> 01:45:43,199
People just taking strolls at 2am.

1044
01:45:43,920 --> 01:45:50,319
All right, please don't come down and get like a glass of milk.

1045
01:46:11,949 --> 01:46:12,510
50 bucks.

1046
01:46:16,010 --> 01:46:16,890
I hope they don't wake up.

1047
01:46:16,890 --> 01:46:18,010
It's three o'clock in the morning.

1048
01:46:18,010 --> 01:46:19,050
Who's gonna wake up right now?

1049
01:46:29,500 --> 01:46:30,460
$15.

1050
01:46:30,460 --> 01:46:30,859
All right.

1051
01:46:33,920 --> 01:46:34,880
Oh, slowly.

1052
01:46:37,399 --> 01:46:38,039
Slowly.

1053
01:46:38,039 --> 01:46:40,939
Oh, whatever.

1054
01:46:40,939 --> 01:46:41,899
They're not gonna fucking hear it.

1055
01:46:41,899 --> 01:46:42,539
They're in the bed.

1056
01:46:45,520 --> 01:46:46,560
Nothing up here anyways.

1057
01:46:46,560 --> 01:46:48,750
All right, no money.

1058
01:46:50,439 --> 01:46:51,239
There's another safe.

1059
01:46:51,239 --> 01:46:58,199
It is plenty of what?

1060
01:46:58,199 --> 01:47:03,710
Somebody in a basement underground?

1061
01:47:06,600 --> 01:47:07,079
Oh, fuck.

1062
01:47:16,279 --> 01:47:17,159
I can't fit in there.

1063
01:47:17,159 --> 01:47:18,039
There's oh, yeah, I can.

1064
01:47:18,039 --> 01:47:19,079
Wait, wait, wait.

1065
01:47:19,079 --> 01:47:21,050
I'm gonna pee.

1066
01:47:21,050 --> 01:47:21,770
I gotta pee my.

1067
01:47:21,770 --> 01:47:22,810
Oh, that's a camera.

1068
01:47:26,380 --> 01:47:28,140
And we got a damaged U-phone.

1069
01:47:28,140 --> 01:47:29,020
If someone's looking for that.

1070
01:47:29,579 --> 01:47:37,880
I'm gonna pee my pants.

1071
01:47:38,520 --> 01:47:39,960
I don't know why I have to pee so bad.

1072
01:47:41,359 --> 01:47:41,859
Why?

1073
01:47:44,399 --> 01:47:44,960
It just started.

1074
01:47:44,960 --> 01:47:45,279
I don't know.

1075
01:47:45,279 --> 01:47:47,439
When I walked in here, I got nervous and I just had to pee.

1076
01:47:48,239 --> 01:47:50,649
I'm like a small dog.

1077
01:47:51,210 --> 01:47:57,239
It was in there.

1078
01:47:57,239 --> 01:47:57,800
Silverware.

1079
01:48:00,460 --> 01:48:01,100
4 a.m.

1080
01:48:01,100 --> 01:48:02,939
I gotta get out of here by like 6.

1081
01:48:09,100 --> 01:48:10,220
Now turn the light off.

1082
01:48:10,220 --> 01:48:11,260
We're easy.

1083
01:48:11,979 --> 01:48:20,840
All right.

1084
01:48:20,840 --> 01:48:21,399
It's time to go.

1085
01:48:22,399 --> 01:48:24,750
I gotta get out of here.

1086
01:48:24,750 --> 01:48:25,920
Okay.

1087
01:48:25,920 --> 01:48:26,800
Oh, Huey.

1088
01:48:27,359 --> 01:48:28,600
What is a Huey?

1089
01:48:29,239 --> 01:48:37,210
Is that your door?

1090
01:48:37,770 --> 01:48:38,890
What was the door?

1091
01:48:38,890 --> 01:48:39,449
I heard door.

1092
01:48:46,640 --> 01:48:49,340
5 a.m.

1093
01:48:49,340 --> 01:48:49,819
5 a.m.

1094
01:48:49,819 --> 01:48:50,060
Out.

1095
01:49:06,890 --> 01:49:08,569
Okay, let's sell this stuff.

1096
01:49:08,569 --> 01:49:13,199
There was something that on that black market,

1097
01:49:13,199 --> 01:49:14,560
somebody wanted one of these things.

1098
01:49:18,329 --> 01:49:18,970
I'll take an A.

1099
01:49:19,850 --> 01:49:20,409
All right.

1100
01:49:20,409 --> 01:49:21,289
So there's another level up.

1101
01:49:21,930 --> 01:49:24,640
I thought the skill point is available.

1102
01:49:24,640 --> 01:49:25,359
Let's take a look.

1103
01:49:26,520 --> 01:49:28,279
So I'm level five.

1104
01:49:28,279 --> 01:49:29,479
I can't even buy this.

1105
01:49:30,279 --> 01:49:31,819
I can do this.

1106
01:49:32,460 --> 01:49:34,699
Appraise more items on the spot.

1107
01:49:34,699 --> 01:49:38,880
That is the only thing I can do.

1108
01:49:39,840 --> 01:49:41,840
So I'd have better appraisal skills.

1109
01:49:42,399 --> 01:49:46,380
I need to do more.

1110
01:49:46,380 --> 01:49:47,420
I need to steal more shit.

1111
01:49:48,140 --> 01:49:51,319
All right.

1112
01:49:51,319 --> 01:49:52,279
What did somebody want here?

1113
01:49:53,880 --> 01:49:58,039
I have any of that.

1114
01:49:58,039 --> 01:49:58,680
Car parts.

1115
01:49:58,680 --> 01:49:59,399
Electronics.

1116
01:50:00,199 --> 01:50:01,800
Somebody wanted a damaged U-phone.

1117
01:50:02,520 --> 01:50:02,840
Sure.

1118
01:50:04,329 --> 01:50:04,970
Router.

1119
01:50:04,970 --> 01:50:05,449
Radio.

1120
01:50:06,010 --> 01:50:06,649
Kitchen.

1121
01:50:06,649 --> 01:50:07,050
Other.

1122
01:50:07,050 --> 01:50:07,689
Antiques.

1123
01:50:08,489 --> 01:50:09,069
What was it?

1124
01:50:09,069 --> 01:50:09,789
What did I pick up?

1125
01:50:09,789 --> 01:50:10,510
I picked something up.

1126
01:50:11,149 --> 01:50:12,640
Oh, here we go.

1127
01:50:12,640 --> 01:50:14,720
Break or steal the pear decoration.

1128
01:50:15,520 --> 01:50:16,399
At 113.

1129
01:50:21,260 --> 01:50:21,899
Easy enough.

1130
01:50:22,699 --> 01:50:23,630
All right.

1131
01:50:23,630 --> 01:50:24,909
I'm going to sleep.

1132
01:50:24,909 --> 01:50:26,109
I'm going to pee my pants.

1133
01:50:26,109 --> 01:50:27,149
So I'll be right back.

1134
01:50:27,149 --> 01:50:28,750
See you guys in like two minutes.

1135
01:52:44,109 --> 01:52:44,989
All right.

1136
01:52:44,989 --> 01:52:51,840
So what do you say?

1137
01:52:51,840 --> 01:52:58,090
But yeah, I mean,

1138
01:52:58,090 --> 01:53:00,970
I make sure that I have none of my stuff like in any windows.

1139
01:53:00,970 --> 01:53:02,010
Like none of any.

1140
01:53:02,010 --> 01:53:03,609
Literally all the stuff that I own.

1141
01:53:03,609 --> 01:53:05,930
I make sure to just completely protect myself.

1142
01:53:05,930 --> 01:53:07,210
Everything I own is underneath my bed.

1143
01:53:08,090 --> 01:53:09,369
Every painting.

1144
01:53:09,369 --> 01:53:10,569
All my game consoles.

1145
01:53:11,369 --> 01:53:12,489
All the money that I own.

1146
01:53:12,489 --> 01:53:13,449
I just put it under my bed.

1147
01:53:14,170 --> 01:53:16,989
So I have like a house worth of shit under my bed.

1148
01:53:17,710 --> 01:53:24,000
So people will look to the windows.

1149
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:25,680
They're like, well, this guy is like fucking nothing.

1150
01:53:25,680 --> 01:53:26,960
But they literally realize

1151
01:53:28,939 --> 01:53:32,779
I have a vintage motorcycle under my bed.

1152
01:53:38,569 --> 01:53:42,329
I've got every DVD of Spongebob under the bed.

1153
01:53:42,329 --> 01:53:49,149
See, what I do is I put,

1154
01:53:49,149 --> 01:53:51,149
I take the Spongebob boxes

1155
01:53:51,869 --> 01:53:54,109
and I leave the boxes out right in the open.

1156
01:53:54,109 --> 01:53:54,670
Like, holy shit.

1157
01:53:54,670 --> 01:53:56,029
Well, he's got all the Spongebob.

1158
01:53:56,029 --> 01:53:57,229
Hey, stupid idiot.

1159
01:53:57,229 --> 01:54:00,279
I put the special features DVDs in there.

1160
01:54:00,279 --> 01:54:01,479
The real ones are under the bed.

1161
01:54:02,039 --> 01:54:16,399
Oh yeah.

1162
01:54:16,399 --> 01:54:17,920
You're asking to get robbed.

1163
01:54:17,920 --> 01:54:19,760
You got all the Spongebob DVDs.

1164
01:54:20,319 --> 01:54:22,590
All right.

1165
01:54:22,590 --> 01:54:23,470
What about this one?

1166
01:54:23,470 --> 01:54:29,470
What about all the limited edition Happy Meal toys?

1167
01:54:31,359 --> 01:54:32,880
They're all under there too.

1168
01:54:32,880 --> 01:54:35,289
Guys, I have a quadruple king.

1169
01:54:36,359 --> 01:54:37,880
The bed is the floor.

1170
01:54:38,520 --> 01:54:39,800
I had it specially built.

1171
01:54:40,359 --> 01:54:42,779
You know, you open up somebody's bedroom

1172
01:54:42,779 --> 01:54:44,779
and there's, oh, there's carpet and there's the bed.

1173
01:54:44,779 --> 01:54:45,500
And no, no, no.

1174
01:54:45,500 --> 01:54:47,340
You open up the door to my bedroom

1175
01:54:47,340 --> 01:54:49,579
and the ground is a king size bed.

1176
01:54:49,579 --> 01:54:50,460
The ground is a bed.

1177
01:54:52,430 --> 01:54:53,550
You have to like open

1178
01:54:53,550 --> 01:54:55,229
and this like made it a special foam

1179
01:54:55,229 --> 01:54:56,350
where there's enough for the door to open

1180
01:54:56,350 --> 01:54:57,869
and then you just kind of climb on.

1181
01:54:57,869 --> 01:55:05,470
It's possible to climb the second floor.

1182
01:55:05,470 --> 01:55:08,829
I want a possible loot location on 104

1183
01:55:08,829 --> 01:55:10,189
because that's the one I can get into, right?

1184
01:55:10,750 --> 01:55:17,500
It's no wonder it took you six weeks to move here.

1185
01:55:17,500 --> 01:55:20,220
I mean, it was an incredibly elaborate project.

1186
01:55:20,939 --> 01:55:22,859
It's like $445,000.

1187
01:55:24,140 --> 01:55:27,720
And the whole, I don't know if it was weird

1188
01:55:27,720 --> 01:55:29,319
because the whole time that the workers were making it

1189
01:55:29,319 --> 01:55:30,119
they were like laughing

1190
01:55:32,619 --> 01:55:33,739
but the door would be closed

1191
01:55:33,739 --> 01:55:36,699
and I would just hear them fucking hysterically laughing

1192
01:55:36,699 --> 01:55:37,979
while they were doing it.

1193
01:55:37,979 --> 01:55:39,920
And I would just pop in like, you know,

1194
01:55:39,920 --> 01:55:42,880
hey boys, like boys, what's going on in here?

1195
01:55:42,880 --> 01:55:43,840
And they'd stop laughing

1196
01:55:43,840 --> 01:55:45,600
and be like nothing, we're just like working.

1197
01:55:45,600 --> 01:55:47,899
Be like, okay, okay.

1198
01:55:47,899 --> 01:55:50,359
And I closed the door and like after like five minutes

1199
01:55:50,359 --> 01:55:51,319
I'd hear them laughing again.

1200
01:55:51,319 --> 01:55:53,239
It was really, really angering me.

1201
01:55:53,239 --> 01:55:56,880
All right, there's a pricey guitar in the garage.

1202
01:56:05,840 --> 01:56:07,520
They were watching the DVDs.

1203
01:56:08,560 --> 01:56:10,010
Yeah, it was weird.

1204
01:56:10,010 --> 01:56:11,609
Like I kept hearing like

1205
01:56:12,489 --> 01:56:15,130
really, really memorable funny SpongeBob quotes

1206
01:56:15,130 --> 01:56:16,090
from inside the room.

1207
01:56:16,810 --> 01:56:17,930
I was under the impression

1208
01:56:17,930 --> 01:56:19,850
that one of them could just do a really good SpongeBob.

1209
01:56:20,569 --> 01:56:21,930
I was like, wow, that one of them in there

1210
01:56:21,930 --> 01:56:24,729
can do a fucking great SpongeBob and a Squidward too.

1211
01:56:24,729 --> 01:56:25,770
They're like having a blast.

1212
01:56:26,569 --> 01:56:30,079
All right, if I got the money,

1213
01:56:30,079 --> 01:56:30,880
I might as well spend it.

1214
01:56:30,880 --> 01:56:32,319
Let's learn everything about 104.

1215
01:56:33,199 --> 01:56:36,750
So pricey guitar in the garage.

1216
01:56:36,750 --> 01:56:38,829
You can climb the second floor vines

1217
01:56:38,829 --> 01:56:42,109
and there's only one person there between 8 and 7 p.m.

1218
01:56:42,109 --> 01:56:42,829
So let's go.

1219
01:56:42,829 --> 01:56:43,390
8 a.m.

1220
01:56:44,029 --> 01:56:44,270
Go.

1221
01:56:44,829 --> 01:56:47,399
And that, what was, which one was that?

1222
01:56:48,039 --> 01:56:54,170
This is 106.

1223
01:56:56,170 --> 01:56:59,289
All right, wait no, 104.

1224
01:56:59,930 --> 01:57:04,670
So what time is it?

1225
01:57:04,670 --> 01:57:05,710
Between 8 and 6.

1226
01:57:06,590 --> 01:57:09,609
Is that 8 p.m. or a.m.?

1227
01:57:10,489 --> 01:57:16,279
So this person is out here from 8 a.m.

1228
01:57:16,840 --> 01:57:17,479
104.

1229
01:57:18,279 --> 01:57:29,579
I don't have anything else to sell I don't think.

1230
01:57:30,300 --> 01:57:38,319
The Jared Leto Joker laugh and the Squidward laugh

1231
01:57:38,319 --> 01:57:39,359
are the same laugh.

1232
01:57:41,689 --> 01:57:42,170
Are they?

1233
01:57:42,170 --> 01:57:42,569
Hold on.

1234
01:57:49,399 --> 01:57:51,439
Fuck, you're right.

1235
01:57:51,439 --> 01:57:54,300
Wow, it's the same thing.

1236
01:57:54,300 --> 01:57:55,260
They're the same laugh.

1237
01:57:56,880 --> 01:57:58,079
You're absolutely correct.

1238
01:58:06,909 --> 01:58:07,550
All right, 104.

1239
01:58:07,550 --> 01:58:11,449
We got all the intro between 8 a.m.

1240
01:58:11,449 --> 01:58:13,130
Let's just sleep in the fucking car.

1241
01:58:13,130 --> 01:58:13,930
I screwed it up.

1242
01:58:13,930 --> 01:58:14,430
8 a.m.

1243
01:58:15,210 --> 01:58:24,920
I bet you 100% German has done a Joker cosplay.

1244
01:58:25,720 --> 01:58:27,069
I have not.

1245
01:58:27,069 --> 01:58:28,989
I have not done a Joker cosplay.

1246
01:58:29,710 --> 01:58:33,420
All right, sleeping in the car until 8 o'clock in the morning.

1247
01:58:35,529 --> 01:58:36,329
Well, 7 a.m.

1248
01:58:36,329 --> 01:58:42,729
To get myself some time.

1249
01:58:42,729 --> 01:58:44,600
All right, run.

1250
01:58:45,560 --> 01:58:47,689
Another way.

1251
01:58:48,250 --> 01:58:55,840
All right, one.

1252
01:58:55,840 --> 01:58:59,680
There's supposed to be one person in here at 8 a.m.

1253
01:59:00,880 --> 01:59:02,319
All right, so the bedroom is downstairs.

1254
01:59:02,319 --> 01:59:03,359
That's really good to know.

1255
01:59:04,159 --> 01:59:09,079
Crouching in a weird place.

1256
01:59:10,359 --> 01:59:11,079
All right, we're fine.

1257
01:59:11,720 --> 01:59:14,279
Crouching in a weird place.

1258
01:59:15,500 --> 01:59:19,180
So I need 104, which is this one.

1259
01:59:19,739 --> 01:59:22,409
I don't think I can get in here though.

1260
01:59:24,039 --> 01:59:25,239
Is this the one that I couldn't get in?

1261
01:59:25,800 --> 01:59:28,140
It's not.

1262
01:59:28,140 --> 01:59:29,420
All right, wait.

1263
01:59:29,420 --> 01:59:30,619
We're going to wait until the person.

1264
01:59:31,260 --> 01:59:32,909
And god damn it.

1265
01:59:32,909 --> 01:59:33,949
I don't think I can do anything here.

1266
01:59:34,750 --> 01:59:35,800
I can't climb these.

1267
01:59:38,569 --> 01:59:40,170
No, I don't have agility too.

1268
01:59:41,470 --> 01:59:42,750
But I can get into the back door.

1269
01:59:43,550 --> 01:59:49,319
I'm going to wait for that person to leave in 10 seconds.

1270
01:59:50,039 --> 01:59:53,180
All right, here they go.

1271
01:59:54,479 --> 01:59:55,119
8 a.m.

1272
01:59:55,119 --> 01:59:56,000
Which way do you go?

1273
01:59:56,960 --> 02:00:00,029
You go over this way, it seems.

1274
02:00:00,029 --> 02:00:01,310
No, you're just going to circle around.

1275
02:00:01,869 --> 02:00:02,670
Out the front door.

1276
02:00:03,470 --> 02:00:14,000
I think I've walked around in a circle three times.

1277
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:16,560
Okay, so there's somebody sleeping down there.

1278
02:00:16,560 --> 02:00:17,520
And they're the only one here.

1279
02:00:20,189 --> 02:00:20,510
What?

1280
02:00:20,510 --> 02:00:20,829
What?

1281
02:00:20,829 --> 02:00:21,069
What?

1282
02:00:21,069 --> 02:00:21,470
Put it down.

1283
02:00:21,470 --> 02:00:21,949
Put it down.

1284
02:00:21,949 --> 02:00:22,510
Put it down.

1285
02:00:24,569 --> 02:00:25,210
Put it down.

1286
02:00:26,399 --> 02:00:27,119
Put it down.

1287
02:00:27,119 --> 02:00:27,920
I can't put it down.

1288
02:00:29,979 --> 02:00:30,939
Lock the exit E.

1289
02:00:33,689 --> 02:00:34,489
Oh my god.

1290
02:00:36,800 --> 02:00:38,319
No, I gotta go.

1291
02:01:05,119 --> 02:01:07,439
That cop has a shitload of food in his mouth.

1292
02:01:08,319 --> 02:01:08,960
He got the call.

1293
02:01:08,960 --> 02:01:09,520
He was right there.

1294
02:01:09,520 --> 02:01:11,800
He's in the middle of his lunch break.

1295
02:01:11,800 --> 02:01:14,199
He's sitting there like eating a delicious fucking turkey club.

1296
02:01:14,199 --> 02:01:15,640
Then all of a sudden he gets like the call.

1297
02:01:16,279 --> 02:01:17,239
Oh shit, like.

1298
02:01:19,800 --> 02:01:32,590
All right, let's try this again.

1299
02:01:32,590 --> 02:01:36,329
Between 8 a.m.

1300
02:01:39,369 --> 02:01:42,239
And 9 p.m.

1301
02:01:43,039 --> 02:01:46,680
Fuck it.

1302
02:01:46,680 --> 02:01:47,880
I'm just getting in there now.

1303
02:01:48,520 --> 02:01:51,039
Because he's going to walk around a circle.

1304
02:01:51,039 --> 02:01:51,840
There's people right here.

1305
02:01:51,840 --> 02:01:52,880
Yeah, just I'm getting in there now.

1306
02:01:52,880 --> 02:01:53,520
I'm going now.

1307
02:01:53,520 --> 02:01:54,239
Get in there now.

1308
02:01:54,880 --> 02:01:59,449
Person right there.

1309
02:02:00,329 --> 02:02:00,970
God damn it.

1310
02:02:00,970 --> 02:02:01,850
Come on.

1311
02:02:01,850 --> 02:02:05,659
Try driving through the garage first.

1312
02:02:06,539 --> 02:02:08,380
The garage is right above this lady.

1313
02:02:09,180 --> 02:02:11,920
Oh, I gotta wait for this person to go.

1314
02:02:15,579 --> 02:02:16,300
Multiple people.

1315
02:02:17,020 --> 02:02:19,390
Who needs a neighborhood watch when

1316
02:02:21,239 --> 02:02:23,720
there's eyeballs on every single street at all times.

1317
02:02:27,390 --> 02:02:31,069
The neighborhood watch is just a connected group of people computers.

1318
02:02:31,069 --> 02:02:31,630
What do you want?

1319
02:02:32,590 --> 02:02:33,149
What's wrong?

1320
02:02:34,300 --> 02:02:35,500
What is wrong with this?

1321
02:02:35,500 --> 02:02:37,260
I'm just like I'm doing the same thing you're doing.

1322
02:02:42,460 --> 02:02:45,279
All right, can I get a second here?

1323
02:02:46,239 --> 02:02:46,960
He's gone.

1324
02:02:46,960 --> 02:02:47,520
She's awake.

1325
02:02:48,479 --> 02:02:49,359
She's going back to bed.

1326
02:02:53,880 --> 02:02:55,319
That's what a neighborhood watch is.

1327
02:02:56,039 --> 02:02:59,420
Am I ever going to be able to do this?

1328
02:02:59,979 --> 02:03:06,880
She's still asleep.

1329
02:03:06,880 --> 02:03:08,319
This is the perfect opportunity to go,

1330
02:03:08,319 --> 02:03:10,800
but I can't until this person is going to turn the other way.

1331
02:03:11,760 --> 02:03:13,390
You walking up here.

1332
02:03:16,250 --> 02:03:20,920
I'll have an opportunity right now.

1333
02:03:20,920 --> 02:03:21,420
No.

1334
02:03:21,960 --> 02:03:24,369
Okay.

1335
02:03:26,590 --> 02:03:28,489
Um, okay, right now.

1336
02:03:36,939 --> 02:03:47,079
Okay, I don't want this is this is that board game.

1337
02:03:47,079 --> 02:03:48,119
Don't wake daddy.

1338
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:54,859
Somebody's an open window.

1339
02:03:55,420 --> 02:03:59,130
This is not even the right house.

1340
02:03:59,850 --> 02:04:02,539
This is somebody else's house.

1341
02:04:04,699 --> 02:04:05,659
Uh, okay.

1342
02:04:06,460 --> 02:04:09,079
I don't know where they are though.

1343
02:04:09,079 --> 02:04:09,640
They might be here.

1344
02:04:10,279 --> 02:04:12,060
This is the guy's office.

1345
02:04:12,060 --> 02:04:12,699
Nice painting.

1346
02:04:13,420 --> 02:04:23,520
I don't see anybody.

1347
02:04:24,159 --> 02:04:42,779
I need intel on this.

1348
02:04:43,500 --> 02:04:44,619
He might be in the other room.

1349
02:04:45,340 --> 02:04:47,159
He might be in this room.

1350
02:04:47,880 --> 02:04:52,649
What if he's in here?

1351
02:04:52,649 --> 02:05:19,840
Oh, come on.

1352
02:05:19,840 --> 02:05:20,720
You don't have anything.

1353
02:05:20,720 --> 02:05:21,920
Turn these off.

1354
02:05:21,920 --> 02:05:31,199
No, I thought that was a person.

1355
02:05:31,199 --> 02:05:31,840
That door is open.

1356
02:05:31,840 --> 02:05:32,560
Somebody's here.

1357
02:05:32,560 --> 02:05:47,579
Somebody's in the house.

1358
02:05:47,579 --> 02:05:51,079
Expensive, uh, expensive toilet in here, right?

1359
02:05:51,079 --> 02:05:52,119
Expensive guitar.

1360
02:05:52,119 --> 02:05:53,000
No, that's the wrong thing.

1361
02:05:53,479 --> 02:06:06,569
They're definitely home later tonight.

1362
02:06:06,569 --> 02:06:34,140
Oh, I got the routine.

1363
02:06:34,140 --> 02:06:44,890
Um, he's gonna be home.

1364
02:06:44,890 --> 02:06:45,390
What?

1365
02:06:50,680 --> 02:06:52,199
I shouldn't see in that.

1366
02:06:52,199 --> 02:06:54,680
Oh, that's a pants shit moment.

1367
02:06:54,680 --> 02:06:57,100
You just peek around the corner.

1368
02:06:57,100 --> 02:06:58,779
You make direct eye contact.

1369
02:06:58,779 --> 02:07:03,239
I need to get to the other house.

1370
02:07:03,239 --> 02:07:10,699
Is she downstairs?

1371
02:07:10,699 --> 02:07:16,460
Oh, can I hide in the bathtub?

1372
02:07:16,460 --> 02:07:16,859
Hide?

1373
02:07:16,859 --> 02:07:17,819
What can I hide?

1374
02:07:17,819 --> 02:07:20,840
That is a nice toilet.

1375
02:07:20,840 --> 02:07:22,039
The husband's gonna be home.

1376
02:07:24,460 --> 02:07:26,060
I'm in deep shit right now.

1377
02:07:26,060 --> 02:07:49,050
What would you even think if if you got home?

1378
02:07:49,979 --> 02:07:51,500
And you didn't notice anything strange.

1379
02:07:51,500 --> 02:07:55,420
The only thing that was weird about your house was your toilet was in a hundred pieces.

1380
02:07:56,060 --> 02:08:04,829
Just be like, I don't even know what happened here.

1381
02:08:06,460 --> 02:08:09,100
Like, honey, do you know what happened to the toilet?

1382
02:08:09,739 --> 02:08:10,220
What was that?

1383
02:08:10,220 --> 02:08:11,979
It's like a golden goblet.

1384
02:08:11,979 --> 02:08:12,859
Oh my god.

1385
02:08:15,310 --> 02:08:16,189
No, give me the remote.

1386
02:08:16,189 --> 02:08:17,149
I got a golden goblet.

1387
02:08:17,149 --> 02:08:17,869
I got that.

1388
02:08:17,869 --> 02:08:18,510
It's time to go.

1389
02:08:19,390 --> 02:08:20,909
I got the ultimate bonus.

1390
02:08:20,909 --> 02:08:21,869
I don't care about the TV.

1391
02:08:25,850 --> 02:08:27,130
Okay, I got time to go.

1392
02:08:31,359 --> 02:08:32,159
Now, where's my exit?

1393
02:08:32,960 --> 02:08:33,600
The husband's home.

1394
02:08:49,420 --> 02:08:50,300
Oh, there's a safe.

1395
02:08:51,239 --> 02:08:51,739
Safe.

1396
02:08:52,699 --> 02:08:59,789
Shit.

1397
02:08:59,789 --> 02:09:00,109
I can't.

1398
02:09:00,109 --> 02:09:00,909
I don't have any more room.

1399
02:09:04,430 --> 02:09:05,069
I gotta get out.

1400
02:09:05,069 --> 02:09:05,310
Out.

1401
02:09:05,949 --> 02:09:07,310
I have the golden goblet.

1402
02:09:08,109 --> 02:09:08,989
What more do I want?

1403
02:09:21,180 --> 02:09:21,579
Painting?

1404
02:09:22,380 --> 02:09:23,500
I can't.

1405
02:09:23,500 --> 02:09:24,300
I can't.

1406
02:09:25,100 --> 02:09:39,130
I can't.

1407
02:09:41,640 --> 02:09:42,359
Put it down.

1408
02:09:42,359 --> 02:09:43,239
Put the painting down.

1409
02:09:44,119 --> 02:09:46,279
I can't put the painting down.

1410
02:09:46,279 --> 02:09:47,239
I can't put the painting down.

1411
02:09:48,939 --> 02:09:49,260
Why?

1412
02:09:50,439 --> 02:09:52,520
I can't put down the painting.

1413
02:09:52,520 --> 02:09:54,399
I'm stuck in the wall.

1414
02:09:57,840 --> 02:09:59,840
My sensitivity just went up by a thousand percent.

1415
02:10:00,909 --> 02:10:01,390
Why?

1416
02:10:01,390 --> 02:10:02,189
What the fuck?

1417
02:10:02,750 --> 02:10:08,640
Why is my sensitivity at 5,000 right now?

1418
02:10:09,359 --> 02:10:09,600
What?

1419
02:10:10,399 --> 02:10:15,680
That was bullshit.

1420
02:10:15,680 --> 02:10:16,720
I couldn't put the painting down.

1421
02:10:19,289 --> 02:10:19,930
I literally...

1422
02:10:19,930 --> 02:10:21,210
The game broke.

1423
02:10:21,210 --> 02:10:22,409
I could not put down the painting.

1424
02:10:22,409 --> 02:10:23,289
And when I put the painting down,

1425
02:10:23,289 --> 02:10:24,489
my sensitivity was a thousand.

1426
02:10:28,560 --> 02:10:30,000
What the hell happened there?

1427
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:32,840
You weren't pressing E.

1428
02:10:32,840 --> 02:10:35,000
I pressed E a hundred times.

1429
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:37,239
And my sensitivity still screwed up.

1430
02:10:37,239 --> 02:10:42,909
What happened?

1431
02:10:42,909 --> 02:10:47,369
Do you see this?

1432
02:10:48,439 --> 02:10:49,319
Why is this so weird?

1433
02:11:06,079 --> 02:11:07,119
That was total horse shit.

1434
02:11:07,840 --> 02:11:10,119
I'm sitting there pressing every button.

1435
02:11:10,199 --> 02:11:11,960
E, click, space.

1436
02:11:11,960 --> 02:11:13,479
It's E, E, E.

1437
02:11:13,479 --> 02:11:14,760
I picked it up with E.

1438
02:11:14,760 --> 02:11:18,170
Something feels off.

1439
02:11:18,170 --> 02:11:23,399
Like really off.

1440
02:11:23,399 --> 02:11:24,600
Even my mouse in the game.

1441
02:11:25,789 --> 02:11:26,670
I'm going to restart the game.

1442
02:11:29,439 --> 02:11:30,399
Is it saved, right?

1443
02:11:38,960 --> 02:11:39,680
DPI?

1444
02:11:39,680 --> 02:11:42,239
Well, I don't know why it just changed in this game.

1445
02:11:42,960 --> 02:11:46,909
Did I panic hit my DPI?

1446
02:11:46,909 --> 02:11:47,550
I mean, there's no...

1447
02:11:47,550 --> 02:11:48,590
I don't have a button to do that.

1448
02:11:49,149 --> 02:11:50,680
I'm just going to reload it.

1449
02:11:51,680 --> 02:12:02,810
Yeah, very effective.

1450
02:12:02,810 --> 02:12:04,250
DPI button on your mouse?

1451
02:12:05,210 --> 02:12:05,529
Is there...

1452
02:12:07,819 --> 02:12:08,380
No.

1453
02:12:08,380 --> 02:12:09,819
I don't even have...

1454
02:12:10,619 --> 02:12:12,439
I have two buttons on my mouse

1455
02:12:12,439 --> 02:12:13,479
that don't do anything.

1456
02:12:19,720 --> 02:12:20,760
Yeah, I do have a death adder.

1457
02:12:20,760 --> 02:12:23,479
I've been using it for almost three straight weeks

1458
02:12:23,479 --> 02:12:25,640
and all the buttons don't do anything.

1459
02:12:25,640 --> 02:12:34,239
Let's see.

1460
02:12:39,550 --> 02:12:41,470
Why couldn't I just put the fucking painting down?

1461
02:12:57,979 --> 02:13:01,260
Why would I use a death adder in 2020?

1462
02:13:09,869 --> 02:13:14,140
Because I have like big fucking hands.

1463
02:13:14,939 --> 02:13:16,729
And every mouse I've ever owned

1464
02:13:16,729 --> 02:13:19,210
that's not a death adder is too small for me.

1465
02:13:20,010 --> 02:13:22,250
I swear to God, I'm not making that up.

1466
02:13:40,319 --> 02:13:40,560
Yeah.

1467
02:13:41,199 --> 02:13:42,560
Oh yeah, you guys are right.

1468
02:13:43,920 --> 02:13:44,800
You guys are right.

1469
02:13:46,750 --> 02:13:47,310
Watch this.

1470
02:13:50,840 --> 02:13:51,720
Why is this on here?

1471
02:13:54,380 --> 02:13:57,130
Let's put it all the way down.

1472
02:13:57,130 --> 02:13:58,250
Back to where it was, where it belongs.

1473
02:13:59,899 --> 02:14:02,460
Why would that be pre-programmed into the mouse?

1474
02:14:03,260 --> 02:14:05,100
If you accidentally fucking press that button

1475
02:14:05,100 --> 02:14:06,699
your mouse just goes to shit.

1476
02:14:10,270 --> 02:14:11,390
By default, that's on?

1477
02:14:12,489 --> 02:14:14,970
What kind of fucking brainless shit is that?

1478
02:14:20,750 --> 02:14:22,510
That wasn't on the original death adder.

1479
02:14:28,520 --> 02:14:29,560
Every mouse has that?

1480
02:14:29,560 --> 02:14:30,279
No, it doesn't?

1481
02:14:30,279 --> 02:14:30,520
Why?

1482
02:14:31,399 --> 02:14:32,680
I don't want that on here.

1483
02:14:32,680 --> 02:14:36,119
I want that to be like EAT or Melee.

1484
02:14:41,720 --> 02:14:42,039
All right.

1485
02:14:42,039 --> 02:14:44,039
Let's see if I can actually not press a button

1486
02:14:44,039 --> 02:14:45,960
and not be able to pick up a fucking painting.

1487
02:15:06,920 --> 02:15:08,439
No, get off of this.

1488
02:15:08,439 --> 02:15:09,159
I need to wait.

1489
02:15:10,539 --> 02:15:11,420
I had it too.

1490
02:15:11,420 --> 02:15:11,899
Like I just...

1491
02:15:12,619 --> 02:15:25,159
But that wasn't even the root of the...

1492
02:15:25,159 --> 02:15:28,489
God.

1493
02:15:28,489 --> 02:15:31,880
That wasn't even the problem.

1494
02:15:33,069 --> 02:15:34,829
Is E to pick up and E to put down.

1495
02:15:35,470 --> 02:15:36,600
And I couldn't put it down.

1496
02:15:37,159 --> 02:15:38,279
That wasn't even the problem.

1497
02:15:51,359 --> 02:15:53,279
How do those buttons get pressed by accident?

1498
02:15:53,279 --> 02:15:55,119
Because I'm trying to press every button.

1499
02:15:55,840 --> 02:16:03,500
I just want the goblet.

1500
02:16:03,500 --> 02:16:06,779
I already had the fucking goblet.

1501
02:16:06,779 --> 02:16:07,579
All right, I'm just going in

1502
02:16:07,579 --> 02:16:09,180
and I'm smashing windows and taking it.

1503
02:16:09,739 --> 02:16:31,949
All right, what time is it?

1504
02:16:32,510 --> 02:16:33,399
All right, he's gone.

1505
02:16:34,120 --> 02:16:34,760
That doesn't even matter.

1506
02:16:34,760 --> 02:16:35,319
Not even the right...

1507
02:16:35,319 --> 02:16:36,120
It's a different house.

1508
02:16:36,920 --> 02:16:51,129
All right.

1509
02:16:51,129 --> 02:16:52,360
I don't care about the painting.

1510
02:16:52,360 --> 02:16:53,079
I want the goblet.

1511
02:17:02,809 --> 02:17:04,250
Press E to drop a goblet.

1512
02:17:11,520 --> 02:17:12,159
Okay.

1513
02:17:12,159 --> 02:17:13,040
I want to show you this.

1514
02:17:13,760 --> 02:17:14,399
E.

1515
02:17:14,399 --> 02:17:14,879
Here we go.

1516
02:17:15,959 --> 02:17:16,360
E.

1517
02:17:16,360 --> 02:17:16,920
It has to be...

1518
02:17:18,200 --> 02:17:23,639
Why did it not work the first time?

1519
02:17:23,639 --> 02:17:25,399
I pressed this a hundred times last time.

1520
02:17:25,959 --> 02:17:26,520
I promise.

1521
02:17:27,239 --> 02:17:30,889
You understand?

1522
02:17:30,889 --> 02:17:31,610
Why is it working now?

1523
02:17:39,229 --> 02:17:39,950
Need room to draw?

1524
02:17:39,950 --> 02:17:40,829
But there was nothing else in the room

1525
02:17:40,829 --> 02:17:41,790
when I was here last time.

1526
02:17:45,340 --> 02:17:45,579
All right.

1527
02:17:45,579 --> 02:17:46,780
Where's that goblet?

1528
02:17:46,780 --> 02:17:58,159
All right.

1529
02:17:58,159 --> 02:17:59,040
Just give me the fucking goblet.

1530
02:17:59,040 --> 02:17:59,440
Give me this.

1531
02:17:59,440 --> 02:18:00,000
Give me out of here.

1532
02:18:00,719 --> 02:18:32,670
Fuck out of here.

1533
02:18:32,670 --> 02:18:33,469
Get out of the...

1534
02:18:33,469 --> 02:18:35,790
Get out of the window before I fucking freak out.

1535
02:18:35,790 --> 02:19:00,969
I'm doing some suspicious walking.

1536
02:19:00,969 --> 02:19:02,090
Didn't break the toilet.

1537
02:20:33,659 --> 02:20:42,360
Fucking Razor Death Adder DPI bullshit.

1538
02:20:42,360 --> 02:20:42,920
That just...

1539
02:20:42,920 --> 02:20:44,120
You hit that person.

1540
02:20:44,120 --> 02:20:58,090
It's a gamer button.

1541
02:20:58,090 --> 02:20:59,850
You wouldn't understand.

1542
02:20:59,850 --> 02:21:00,989
No.

1543
02:21:00,989 --> 02:21:02,829
And don't when I plug the mouse in

1544
02:21:02,829 --> 02:21:06,719
try to install your fucking like parasite software.

1545
02:21:06,719 --> 02:21:15,920
That's another thing.

1546
02:21:15,920 --> 02:21:26,270
66 bucks for this?

1547
02:21:26,270 --> 02:21:26,670
That's it.

1548
02:21:26,670 --> 02:21:28,190
That's all we got for that.

1549
02:21:28,190 --> 02:21:29,469
Oh, we got a lot of new quests.

1550
02:21:30,030 --> 02:21:30,510
All right.

1551
02:21:31,469 --> 02:21:35,790
Are you ready for this?

1552
02:21:35,790 --> 02:21:37,950
This is 104, 105, 106.

1553
02:21:39,870 --> 02:21:40,750
We're gonna try...

1554
02:21:40,750 --> 02:21:42,030

1555
02:21:42,030 --> 02:21:43,149
Break their TV.

1556
02:21:43,149 --> 02:21:43,950
Break their sink.

1557
02:21:43,950 --> 02:21:45,149
These are my kind of missions.

1558
02:21:47,159 --> 02:21:48,120

1559
02:21:48,120 --> 02:21:49,159
Break the fucking window.

1560
02:21:49,159 --> 02:21:49,799

1561
02:21:49,799 --> 02:21:50,760
Break this TV.

1562
02:21:50,760 --> 02:21:51,559
And 106.

1563
02:21:51,559 --> 02:21:52,760
Break the sink.

1564
02:21:52,760 --> 02:21:53,239
Back to it.

1565
02:21:53,239 --> 02:21:53,559
Let's go.

1566
02:22:08,920 --> 02:22:11,319
What's a brainless guy that came up with that?

1567
02:22:14,090 --> 02:22:17,290
I'm gonna rebind those to like a sound effect.

1568
02:22:17,290 --> 02:22:18,649
Like a fucking fart sound.

1569
02:22:29,979 --> 02:22:30,620
I'm home.

1570
02:22:31,340 --> 02:22:33,389
Oh, what's this?

1571
02:22:34,110 --> 02:22:39,709
What did I say I wanted to change to?

1572
02:22:39,709 --> 02:22:40,190
To eat?

1573
02:22:40,829 --> 02:22:44,969
This is like total fucking rage coming up.

1574
02:22:44,969 --> 02:22:46,329
I want to rebind it to eat.

1575
02:22:51,469 --> 02:22:51,709
Okay.

1576
02:22:51,709 --> 02:22:52,350
What was in here?

1577
02:22:52,909 --> 02:22:55,040
One needs to be broken in here.

1578
02:22:55,840 --> 02:22:56,479

1579
02:22:57,790 --> 02:22:58,590
Break a window.

1580
02:23:18,860 --> 02:23:19,340

1581
02:23:19,340 --> 02:23:19,739
What was...

1582
02:23:20,379 --> 02:23:23,239
Get out quick!

1583
02:23:24,280 --> 02:23:25,629
Oh, I'm stuck.

1584
02:23:25,629 --> 02:23:26,270
No, get back in.

1585
02:23:36,909 --> 02:23:37,790
Get in!

1586
02:23:37,790 --> 02:23:46,920
They leave the window opened in the back.

1587
02:23:50,489 --> 02:23:51,290
Freeze!

1588
02:23:51,290 --> 02:23:51,530
What?

1589
02:23:52,090 --> 02:24:04,090
That was house 106.

1590
02:24:07,840 --> 02:24:09,040
This game is fucking funny.

1591
02:24:15,819 --> 02:24:16,540
This just put me here.

1592
02:24:16,540 --> 02:24:17,100
I didn't do it.

1593
02:24:17,100 --> 02:24:17,420
All right.

1594
02:24:17,420 --> 02:24:18,299
So 106.

1595
02:24:18,299 --> 02:24:19,340
Which one's the sink?

1596
02:24:22,250 --> 02:24:24,969
106 is break the sink.

1597
02:24:25,930 --> 02:24:26,569
And then break...

1598
02:24:26,569 --> 02:24:26,809
Okay.

1599
02:24:26,809 --> 02:24:27,450
106.

1600
02:24:27,450 --> 02:24:28,569
Break sink.

1601
02:24:28,569 --> 02:24:29,370
Break TV.

1602
02:24:30,170 --> 02:24:30,889
Break window.

1603
02:24:39,930 --> 02:24:40,409
Ah, yes.

1604
02:24:40,409 --> 02:24:41,290
Excuse me, ma'am.

1605
02:24:41,850 --> 02:24:44,319
Could you please come to the door?

1606
02:24:54,620 --> 02:24:55,340
Where's your sink?

1607
02:25:30,569 --> 02:25:33,530
He just did the thing when you walk by a public bathroom stall.

1608
02:25:34,840 --> 02:25:36,920
You like see the guy and he sees you and it's like,

1609
02:25:36,920 --> 02:25:37,879
Oh, fuck!

1610
02:25:37,879 --> 02:25:56,489
Police are going to tow my car.

1611
02:25:56,489 --> 02:25:56,969
Oh, shit.

1612
02:25:56,969 --> 02:25:59,799
The police are going to tow the car.

1613
02:25:59,799 --> 02:26:00,680
Break TV.

1614
02:26:00,680 --> 02:26:07,360
Are they coming back?

1615
02:26:07,360 --> 02:26:08,799
Are they coming to tow the car?

1616
02:26:08,799 --> 02:26:10,559
Are they coming to...

1617
02:26:10,559 --> 02:26:11,360
I got to...

1618
02:26:11,360 --> 02:26:12,639
Do I fail the mission if they do that?

1619
02:26:13,680 --> 02:26:18,989
The police are going to tow the car.

1620
02:26:19,709 --> 02:26:28,909
No, don't tow the car.

1621
02:26:28,909 --> 02:26:29,549
I'm just...

1622
02:26:29,549 --> 02:26:30,350
I'm coming out right now.

1623
02:26:41,530 --> 02:26:42,729
Fuck out of the way.

1624
02:26:42,729 --> 02:27:05,579
I didn't even touch that guy.

1625
02:27:07,040 --> 02:27:07,520
Okay.

1626
02:27:07,520 --> 02:27:10,479
Well, so get in the car.

1627
02:27:11,280 --> 02:27:13,870
Just pull it over here.

1628
02:27:28,700 --> 02:27:29,500
106.

1629
02:27:29,500 --> 02:27:30,059
Sink.

1630
02:27:30,059 --> 02:27:30,700
105.

1631
02:27:30,700 --> 02:27:31,420
TV.

1632
02:27:31,420 --> 02:27:32,059
104.

1633
02:27:33,520 --> 02:27:33,920
Window.

1634
02:27:35,290 --> 02:27:37,930
I need to do that one last because that's going to cause an alarm.

1635
02:27:38,969 --> 02:27:41,879
So we've got 106.

1636
02:27:43,579 --> 02:27:44,780
I don't know if anybody's here or not,

1637
02:27:45,500 --> 02:27:47,260
but the doorbell seemed to work pretty well.

1638
02:28:03,370 --> 02:28:04,569
Get fucking out of here.

1639
02:28:06,110 --> 02:28:10,010
All right.

1640
02:28:11,209 --> 02:28:11,530
Sink.

1641
02:28:12,090 --> 02:28:30,299
Oh, that hurt.

1642
02:28:30,299 --> 02:28:38,639
I have to pick the lock from the inside.

1643
02:28:38,639 --> 02:28:40,649
Can I bring the doorbell from out here?

1644
02:28:40,649 --> 02:28:41,610
Oh, come on.

1645
02:28:41,610 --> 02:28:54,059
Jump out the...

1646
02:28:54,059 --> 02:28:54,540
I know, I know.

1647
02:28:54,540 --> 02:28:55,739
But like, but hold on.

1648
02:28:55,739 --> 02:28:56,540
I'm panicking.

1649
02:28:56,540 --> 02:28:57,100
I'm panicking.

1650
02:29:04,250 --> 02:29:05,370
But isn't she in this room?

1651
02:29:05,370 --> 02:29:15,920
She's in this room right now.

1652
02:29:15,920 --> 02:29:16,719
Ah, ah!

1653
02:29:16,719 --> 02:29:19,790
I told you.

1654
02:29:19,790 --> 02:29:21,229
I told you she was in the room.

1655
02:29:21,229 --> 02:29:29,530
She's not going to come in here, right?

1656
02:29:29,530 --> 02:29:33,129
What was that?

1657
02:29:41,739 --> 02:30:13,420
Where is she?

1658
02:30:13,420 --> 02:30:14,139
What room is she in?

1659
02:30:14,139 --> 02:30:14,459
Where is she?

1660
02:30:14,459 --> 02:30:15,020
I don't know where she is.

1661
02:30:15,020 --> 02:30:15,420
I heard her.

1662
02:30:17,799 --> 02:30:19,159
This is open.

1663
02:30:19,159 --> 02:30:20,120
But is she right here?

1664
02:30:20,120 --> 02:30:22,750
I think she's right here.

1665
02:30:22,750 --> 02:30:29,629
I don't know where the fuck she is.

1666
02:30:29,629 --> 02:30:30,350
She's in this room.

1667
02:30:33,450 --> 02:30:34,489
I hear the footsteps.

1668
02:30:34,489 --> 02:30:35,450
It's driving me crazy.

1669
02:30:38,920 --> 02:30:39,959
Oh shit, the husband.

1670
02:30:44,090 --> 02:30:45,209
It was the husband.

1671
02:30:45,209 --> 02:30:45,770
All right.

1672
02:30:45,770 --> 02:30:46,649
We take what we can get here.

1673
02:30:46,649 --> 02:30:46,969
Come on.

1674
02:30:52,639 --> 02:30:53,520
Oh shit.

1675
02:30:53,520 --> 02:30:54,159
That was bad.

1676
02:30:54,159 --> 02:30:54,719
But no, no, no.

1677
02:30:54,719 --> 02:30:55,040
That's okay.

1678
02:30:55,040 --> 02:30:55,440
That's okay.

1679
02:30:56,000 --> 02:30:57,879
Where are they going to go?

1680
02:30:57,879 --> 02:30:58,680
Inside this room?

1681
02:31:04,510 --> 02:31:06,030
No, I'm so fucked right now.

1682
02:31:06,670 --> 02:31:11,360
Hiding.

1683
02:31:11,360 --> 02:31:11,600
Hide.

1684
02:31:12,159 --> 02:31:12,399
Get.

1685
02:31:13,200 --> 02:31:13,440
Ha.

1686
02:31:13,440 --> 02:31:13,680
Uh.

1687
02:31:19,020 --> 02:31:23,260
So this is very hard without knowing when the husband's going to come home.

1688
02:31:23,819 --> 02:31:33,559
Unlock all the doors.

1689
02:31:33,559 --> 02:31:35,000
I like need the other tools.

1690
02:31:35,719 --> 02:31:39,639
I need like the other lockpicks.

1691
02:31:40,360 --> 02:31:41,879
I need like the electrical kits.

1692
02:31:42,600 --> 02:31:49,450
You could have just opened that other window to leave.

1693
02:31:52,409 --> 02:31:53,129
Could I have though?

1694
02:31:58,909 --> 02:32:00,909
Who locks individual doors to their house?

1695
02:32:00,909 --> 02:32:01,870
I don't, I don't know.

1696
02:32:01,870 --> 02:32:04,350
Why do you have like locks on every door?

1697
02:32:13,440 --> 02:32:20,350
If I had like a person in the house, I had like a tenant call the player.

1698
02:32:20,350 --> 02:32:21,229
We got two of them done.

1699
02:32:21,790 --> 02:32:24,780
The only other thing is break the guy's TV and uh, where is it?

1700
02:32:24,780 --> 02:32:25,260
105.

1701
02:32:25,979 --> 02:32:29,129
But I know nothing about these people.

1702
02:32:29,850 --> 02:32:31,770
This is going to be impossible without knowing that.

1703
02:32:32,409 --> 02:32:35,719
Didn't get the sink?

1704
02:32:35,719 --> 02:32:36,200
Yeah, I didn't.

1705
02:32:37,159 --> 02:32:39,610
How did I not get the sink?

1706
02:32:40,250 --> 02:32:43,000
Was it the wrong house?

1707
02:32:45,420 --> 02:32:46,540
Broke the wrong sink.

1708
02:32:55,100 --> 02:32:56,059
The kitchen sink?

1709
02:32:58,270 --> 02:33:03,129
What you broke wasn't a sink.

1710
02:33:05,129 --> 02:33:07,129
That was very clearly a sink.

1711
02:33:08,760 --> 02:33:09,799
It was a sink.

1712
02:33:10,440 --> 02:33:13,229
I don't have to get the kitchen sink.

1713
02:33:15,930 --> 02:33:16,809
Was it bidet?

1714
02:33:17,690 --> 02:33:19,290
I don't think I can leave.

1715
02:33:19,850 --> 02:33:20,969
I'm stuck here forever.

1716
02:33:21,690 --> 02:33:28,520
No, it's the, it is the right house.

1717
02:33:31,709 --> 02:33:34,750
So I have to run up and smash the sink upstairs.

1718
02:33:50,620 --> 02:33:51,979
He's using the toilet.

1719
02:33:51,979 --> 02:34:06,239
So you tell me this wasn't a sink in here.

1720
02:34:06,239 --> 02:34:07,360
I'm not breaking the toilet.

1721
02:34:08,239 --> 02:34:11,239
The police, like AI is like stuck here.

1722
02:34:16,479 --> 02:34:17,440
It's already open.

1723
02:34:18,719 --> 02:34:28,760
What is going to happen?

1724
02:34:28,760 --> 02:34:29,479
Is it going to close?

1725
02:34:31,159 --> 02:34:32,120
I got it.

1726
02:34:32,120 --> 02:34:52,600
What's she sitting on?

1727
02:34:52,600 --> 02:34:53,239
Okay, sink.

1728
02:34:54,750 --> 02:34:56,750
Oh my fucking god.

1729
02:34:56,750 --> 02:34:57,950
You guys weren't kidding.

1730
02:34:58,750 --> 02:35:03,280
They break the sink.

1731
02:35:03,920 --> 02:35:13,790
That was the same one that was downstairs.

1732
02:35:13,790 --> 02:35:16,159
That was the same sink.

1733
02:35:16,159 --> 02:35:16,719
Give me a break.

1734
02:35:17,280 --> 02:35:18,829
How was I supposed to know that?

1735
02:35:19,389 --> 02:35:25,879
Where are these police?

1736
02:35:32,670 --> 02:35:33,950
Can I please get out of here?

1737
02:35:36,719 --> 02:35:38,079
I have three stars.

1738
02:35:48,829 --> 02:35:49,629
What the fuck?

1739
02:35:53,899 --> 02:35:56,700
Broke a window and you're going to get a helicopter in here?

1740
02:35:58,170 --> 02:35:59,209
Is there a chopper?

1741
02:36:05,930 --> 02:36:07,370
I smashed a window.

1742
02:36:08,700 --> 02:36:11,579
I did the equivalent of like two kids playing baseball.

1743
02:36:12,750 --> 02:36:13,950
I don't think I can get out of here.

1744
02:36:15,020 --> 02:36:16,139
I think I'm screwed.

1745
02:36:16,780 --> 02:36:37,469
I wonder.

1746
02:36:37,469 --> 02:36:38,590
See this window is locked.

1747
02:36:38,590 --> 02:36:39,309
I can't open it.

1748
02:36:40,729 --> 02:36:42,409
I can't open this fucking window.

1749
02:36:42,409 --> 02:36:52,010
Ah, seen by a tenant.

1750
02:36:52,010 --> 02:36:53,629
The chopper is right here.

1751
02:36:54,430 --> 02:37:00,040
How am I supposed to get out of here?

1752
02:37:13,870 --> 02:37:16,909
I'm going to break a TV.

1753
02:37:16,909 --> 02:37:18,030
I'm just going to break a TV.

1754
02:37:23,290 --> 02:37:24,489
Where's the TV?

1755
02:37:28,649 --> 02:37:31,450
Okay, this is like, this is getting a little out of hand.

1756
02:37:39,420 --> 02:37:40,299
Wait this out.

1757
02:37:40,299 --> 02:37:41,500
I can't wait this out.

1758
02:37:41,500 --> 02:37:42,379
This is 104?

1759
02:37:43,260 --> 02:37:45,000
What do I need to do in 104?

1760
02:37:47,770 --> 02:37:48,569
What the fuck?

1761
02:37:50,120 --> 02:37:50,680
I'm done.

1762
02:37:50,680 --> 02:37:51,399
I'm getting out of here.

1763
02:37:57,120 --> 02:37:57,620
Uh-oh.

1764
02:37:58,840 --> 02:37:59,639
Uh-oh, wait.

1765
02:37:59,639 --> 02:38:00,139
No.

1766
02:38:04,639 --> 02:38:06,879
Just give me a mission to do.

1767
02:38:07,360 --> 02:38:10,079
I just need to level up to six and then we can keep going.

1768
02:38:10,079 --> 02:38:12,159
I'm not, I'm not leveled up enough.

1769
02:38:17,879 --> 02:38:18,920
Am I level six yet?

1770
02:38:19,799 --> 02:38:21,319
Can I climb fences now?

1771
02:38:28,760 --> 02:38:29,639
Oh, thank God.

1772
02:38:31,639 --> 02:38:33,479
Okay, we can continue with the tutorial.

1773
02:38:34,120 --> 02:38:39,520
That's Jilly 2.

1774
02:38:39,520 --> 02:38:40,020
I got it.

1775
02:38:48,090 --> 02:38:52,059
Um, is there a reason why we're not going on here?

1776
02:39:00,510 --> 02:39:01,950
Fucking DPI settings.

1777
02:39:02,750 --> 02:39:06,809
I'm just going to go home.

1778
02:39:07,370 --> 02:39:20,750
Fucking Windows 98.

1779
02:39:20,750 --> 02:39:25,370
Hey, you know what else ain't broke?

1780
02:39:25,450 --> 02:39:27,530
Is Greenview 104's windshield.

1781
02:39:27,530 --> 02:39:30,409
No, I, I, every time you make me do this, man, I fuck it all up.

1782
02:39:30,409 --> 02:39:31,850
And then I get angry at my muffs.

1783
02:39:32,649 --> 02:39:33,450
Welcome back.

1784
02:39:37,229 --> 02:39:37,729
Whoa.

1785
02:39:39,819 --> 02:39:40,700
I won't buy this.

1786
02:39:40,700 --> 02:39:41,659
Wipe it and we'll talk.

1787
02:39:41,659 --> 02:39:42,379
Oh, never mind.

1788
02:39:57,760 --> 02:40:00,639
Hey, go smash somebody's windshield at 104.

1789
02:40:00,639 --> 02:40:02,719
You know, you've been there like a thousand times.

1790
02:40:03,520 --> 02:40:05,520
You keep breaking shit and keep getting arrested.

1791
02:40:05,520 --> 02:40:09,040
And then you progressively get more frustrated at yourself and at the game.

1792
02:40:09,040 --> 02:40:25,799
And then you start blaming your hardware.

1793
02:40:25,799 --> 02:40:27,879
All right, so climbing gloves.

1794
02:40:27,879 --> 02:40:30,840
Why would you need 1200 dollars?

1795
02:40:30,840 --> 02:40:33,879
Hopefully it, that was a good, that was, that was not a mistake, I hope.

1796
02:40:40,219 --> 02:40:42,219
Break a car window in 104.

1797
02:40:57,500 --> 02:40:59,020
The gloves cost more than the car.

1798
02:40:59,659 --> 02:41:04,270
All right.

1799
02:41:04,270 --> 02:41:05,549
Break a car window at 104.

1800
02:41:06,270 --> 02:41:07,229
You got it.

1801
02:41:07,229 --> 02:41:20,360
It's going to take two seconds, right?

1802
02:41:20,360 --> 02:41:21,000
Well, I can climb.

1803
02:41:32,969 --> 02:41:34,090
Break a window.

1804
02:41:34,090 --> 02:41:34,729
Break a car.

1805
02:41:43,930 --> 02:41:45,530
So I'm going to break the car window.

1806
02:41:45,530 --> 02:41:47,370
I'm going to break a window and get out of here.

1807
02:41:53,690 --> 02:41:54,329
He's not home.

1808
02:41:55,420 --> 02:41:59,100
So I need to get down to the garage and break the window of the garage.

1809
02:42:02,319 --> 02:42:03,280
I can't carry this.

1810
02:42:03,280 --> 02:42:03,760
Put it down.

1811
02:42:04,319 --> 02:42:10,250
What else is in here?

1812
02:42:10,250 --> 02:42:11,129
I've got like an opportunity.

1813
02:42:11,129 --> 02:42:12,409
Might as well take it for a second.

1814
02:42:15,639 --> 02:42:17,159
Okay, he's going to be back very soon.

1815
02:42:17,879 --> 02:42:22,270
So we need to get to garage.

1816
02:42:22,270 --> 02:42:22,590
Car.

1817
02:42:22,590 --> 02:42:23,069
Here we go.

1818
02:42:23,709 --> 02:42:24,590
So I need.

1819
02:42:26,590 --> 02:42:27,629
Inventory is full.

1820
02:42:28,430 --> 02:42:33,579
Can I throw shit away?

1821
02:42:34,139 --> 02:42:38,600
Fuck the radio.

1822
02:42:38,600 --> 02:42:39,319
Give me the guitar.

1823
02:42:40,600 --> 02:42:42,379
Okay, break a window.

1824
02:42:42,379 --> 02:42:43,420
Can I open this garage?

1825
02:42:44,620 --> 02:42:45,420
Okay, here we go.

1826
02:42:55,690 --> 02:42:56,569
Oh, no.

1827
02:42:57,129 --> 02:42:57,770
Oh, no.

1828
02:42:58,489 --> 02:43:41,549
Get it open.

1829
02:43:41,549 --> 02:43:44,139
Holy shit.

1830
02:43:44,139 --> 02:43:44,780
What?

1831
02:43:44,780 --> 02:43:46,459
What was the thing that he wasn't even on the screen?

1832
02:43:46,459 --> 02:43:47,340
He wasn't even on the mini-map.

1833
02:43:47,340 --> 02:43:48,139
What?

1834
02:43:48,139 --> 02:43:49,930
He wasn't even on the mini-map.

1835
02:43:54,719 --> 02:43:55,920
What the hell?

1836
02:43:55,920 --> 02:44:00,639
He wasn't on the...

1837
02:44:07,260 --> 02:44:08,299
And he had a key.

1838
02:44:08,299 --> 02:44:16,680
I would have got out.

1839
02:44:16,680 --> 02:44:17,399
That would have been...

1840
02:44:17,399 --> 02:44:18,280
I would have made it.

1841
02:44:18,280 --> 02:44:31,180
You can only climb the fence in certain places.

1842
02:44:33,159 --> 02:44:34,520
None of which are here.

1843
02:44:34,520 --> 02:44:37,020
I have to climb up there and go down.

1844
02:44:37,659 --> 02:44:42,489
Why am I doing this during the day?

1845
02:44:42,489 --> 02:44:48,010
Because the husband is not there during the day.

1846
02:44:48,569 --> 02:44:51,920
Unlock it before you start.

1847
02:44:52,559 --> 02:44:53,920
Car parked in a strange place.

1848
02:44:53,920 --> 02:44:54,319
Hold on.

1849
02:44:54,879 --> 02:45:00,780
Come on.

1850
02:45:02,959 --> 02:45:04,239
I'm going to accidentally hit somebody.

1851
02:45:04,799 --> 02:45:08,569
The police are going to tell the car, come on.

1852
02:45:09,129 --> 02:45:12,799
I might as well just restart it.

1853
02:45:13,520 --> 02:45:35,040
Triple parked.

1854
02:45:37,399 --> 02:45:38,520
I would have got out of there too.

1855
02:45:39,639 --> 02:45:46,799
All right.

1856
02:45:46,799 --> 02:45:49,920
So I'm going to open up all the doors before I do anything.

1857
02:45:50,639 --> 02:45:59,520
Let me see how strange.

1858
02:46:00,079 --> 02:46:13,360
All right.

1859
02:46:13,360 --> 02:46:13,920
What time is it?

1860
02:46:14,559 --> 02:46:14,799
Four.

1861
02:46:15,520 --> 02:46:17,120
I'm going to sleep until 8 a.m.

1862
02:46:19,149 --> 02:46:20,350
Because that's when he leaves

1863
02:46:20,350 --> 02:46:21,469
and I have all the time I need.

1864
02:46:29,610 --> 02:46:30,090
8 a.m.

1865
02:46:36,409 --> 02:46:38,409
So she's sleeping.

1866
02:46:38,409 --> 02:46:39,530
This person right here.

1867
02:46:39,530 --> 02:46:45,000
I'm going to unlock all these doors before I do this.

1868
02:46:46,040 --> 02:46:50,329
I'm going to unlock this one and then I can get...

1869
02:46:50,329 --> 02:46:50,649
Let's see.

1870
02:46:50,649 --> 02:46:52,170
Make sure I can get out of that one.

1871
02:46:52,170 --> 02:46:55,690
I don't have time to do this.

1872
02:46:56,250 --> 02:47:02,559
Somebody's walking on the other side here, right?

1873
02:47:03,200 --> 02:47:04,239
I don't think I have enough time.

1874
02:47:04,799 --> 02:47:05,920
I have to wait.

1875
02:47:05,920 --> 02:47:08,860
I'll do this one first.

1876
02:47:09,579 --> 02:47:11,819
Because there ain't nobody looking over here, right?

1877
02:47:12,459 --> 02:47:32,540
Okay.

1878
02:47:32,540 --> 02:47:33,420
This one's open.

1879
02:47:36,860 --> 02:47:37,579
Open.

1880
02:47:44,329 --> 02:47:45,530
Thank God there's no fall damage.

1881
02:47:45,530 --> 02:47:46,250
All right.

1882
02:47:46,250 --> 02:47:47,530
Do I have an opportunity to do this now?

1883
02:47:54,799 --> 02:47:55,440
Not quite.

1884
02:47:59,000 --> 02:48:00,600
Put on the pink pantheon music.

1885
02:48:10,989 --> 02:48:11,469
All right.

1886
02:48:15,799 --> 02:48:16,360
I'm going to get it like...

1887
02:48:16,360 --> 02:48:16,680
Hold on.

1888
02:48:16,680 --> 02:48:19,159
Let me get it queued up so I can have it.

1889
02:48:19,159 --> 02:48:32,879
All right.

1890
02:48:32,879 --> 02:48:33,520
It's loading.

1891
02:48:42,399 --> 02:48:42,799
Whatever.

1892
02:48:43,440 --> 02:48:51,469
This is going to distract me.

1893
02:48:58,440 --> 02:48:58,920
Here we go.

1894
02:50:30,620 --> 02:50:31,579
Get out of the way!

1895
02:50:32,299 --> 02:50:34,139
Why is it always somebody here?

1896
02:51:31,709 --> 02:51:32,030
No!

1897
02:51:32,030 --> 02:51:32,270
No!

1898
02:51:32,909 --> 02:51:33,149
No!

1899
02:51:33,149 --> 02:51:33,950
I went the wrong way.

1900
02:51:36,459 --> 02:51:36,860
No!

1901
02:51:36,860 --> 02:51:37,500
Shit!

1902
02:51:39,530 --> 02:51:41,690
I thought there was...

1903
02:51:41,690 --> 02:51:42,409
No.

1904
02:51:42,409 --> 02:51:42,969
It's okay.

1905
02:51:49,920 --> 02:51:50,639
That's the wrong way.

1906
02:51:50,639 --> 02:51:50,799
No.

1907
02:51:50,799 --> 02:51:51,280
I can go.

1908
02:51:51,280 --> 02:51:52,239
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

1909
02:51:58,190 --> 02:51:59,309
What is playing right now?

1910
02:52:02,360 --> 02:52:03,079
Back up quick!

1911
02:52:03,079 --> 02:52:03,479
Back up!

1912
02:52:09,479 --> 02:52:09,959
Don't!

1913
02:52:10,920 --> 02:52:11,159
No!

1914
02:52:12,200 --> 02:52:14,040
God, this is fucking music.

1915
02:52:15,000 --> 02:52:20,270
Oh, I turned the wrong direction.

1916
02:52:20,270 --> 02:52:21,629
I'm going to have a meltdown.

1917
02:52:22,190 --> 02:52:23,790
I'm going to have a meltdown.

1918
02:52:29,209 --> 02:52:30,729
Why is this auto playing?

1919
02:52:31,530 --> 02:52:33,239
I think I crashed the game.

1920
02:52:33,239 --> 02:52:34,200
I did.

1921
02:52:34,200 --> 02:53:00,649
I can't even open the game again.

1922
02:53:00,649 --> 02:53:14,120
I like went down too far.

1923
02:53:16,299 --> 02:53:19,899
Distracting myself with fucking music blasted in my ear.

1924
02:53:20,620 --> 02:53:33,520
Trying to like play the game to the music.

1925
02:53:33,520 --> 02:53:35,120
Like just fucking do it.

1926
02:53:35,120 --> 02:53:41,049
Why would I do that?

1927
02:53:41,049 --> 02:53:43,739
There's literally no reason to do that.

1928
02:53:46,559 --> 02:53:50,719
I can't think of one single reason why you would play that song and try to do it.

1929
02:53:50,719 --> 02:53:51,760
It's difficult to do.

1930
02:53:52,479 --> 02:53:58,719
You know, it's like crap, man.

1931
02:54:00,920 --> 02:54:01,879
Did we crash again?

1932
02:54:02,440 --> 02:54:04,479
No, we're fine.

1933
02:54:06,799 --> 02:54:09,159
Maybe we're not.

1934
02:54:09,159 --> 02:54:09,399
All right.

1935
02:54:09,399 --> 02:54:12,440
Yeah, like I mean like what the hell would I possibly be thinking?

1936
02:54:13,159 --> 02:54:14,959
You know what I'm saying?

1937
02:54:14,959 --> 02:54:16,559
Like why would I do something like that?

1938
02:54:16,559 --> 02:54:17,520
That was just stupid.

1939
02:56:30,000 --> 02:56:30,719
Okay.

1940
02:56:30,719 --> 02:56:32,840
Here we go.

1941
02:56:33,319 --> 02:56:36,430
I got a very, very small loan from my father.

1942
02:56:36,430 --> 02:56:38,190
I think I have to start somewhere.

1943
02:56:38,190 --> 02:56:39,389
Wait, what?

1944
02:56:40,190 --> 02:56:40,750
Wait.

1945
02:56:40,750 --> 02:56:42,350
Oh, I'm freaking myself.

1946
02:56:42,350 --> 02:56:43,629
Why is this playing?

1947
02:56:43,629 --> 02:56:44,430
Why is this playing?

1948
02:56:49,850 --> 02:56:50,649
No, stop it.

1949
02:56:50,649 --> 02:56:52,170
I know I just did it.

1950
02:56:52,170 --> 02:56:52,649
I did it.

1951
02:56:53,530 --> 02:56:54,329
Get out of here.

1952
02:56:56,670 --> 02:56:56,989
Okay.

1953
02:56:56,989 --> 02:56:57,389
I'm fine.

1954
02:56:57,389 --> 02:56:59,549
I'm fine.

1955
02:56:59,549 --> 02:56:59,870
Okay.

1956
02:56:59,870 --> 02:57:00,270
We're fine.

1957
02:57:00,270 --> 02:57:00,750
We did it.

1958
02:57:13,290 --> 02:57:14,569
What is auto?

1959
02:57:16,479 --> 02:57:17,760
What is auto playing?

1960
02:57:17,760 --> 02:57:27,770
It's playing the Freddy Krueger theme song.

1961
02:57:33,739 --> 02:57:34,299
It's not.

1962
02:57:44,030 --> 02:57:45,469
Where did Trump come from?

1963
02:57:49,709 --> 02:57:51,200
All right.

1964
02:57:51,200 --> 02:57:52,879
Should I just keep auto play on the whole stream?

1965
02:57:53,680 --> 02:57:54,559
What do you think?

1966
02:57:54,559 --> 02:57:59,420
What's going to happen?

1967
02:58:04,040 --> 02:58:05,479
At least for like the next few minutes.

1968
02:58:06,600 --> 02:58:07,000
Come on.

1969
02:58:07,000 --> 02:58:10,200
I don't a D with a five stealth XP bonus.

1970
02:58:15,159 --> 02:58:16,280
I can't handle it, man.

1971
02:58:16,280 --> 02:58:16,840
I'm sorry.

1972
02:58:20,909 --> 02:58:22,110
I need lockpicking three.

1973
02:58:26,170 --> 02:58:27,450
Lockpicking three.

1974
02:58:27,450 --> 02:58:28,889
I need to be level.

1975
02:58:28,889 --> 02:58:30,409
I got to just get to the skill point.

1976
02:58:37,020 --> 02:58:37,979
Donald Trump shit.

1977
02:58:37,979 --> 02:58:39,819
Like, why was that playing?

1978
02:58:40,700 --> 02:58:41,639
What?

1979
02:58:41,639 --> 02:58:44,040
Even I swallowed about a million dollars.

1980
02:58:44,040 --> 02:58:48,040
Like, I just played fucking the Pink Panther theme song, man.

1981
02:58:52,219 --> 02:58:53,899
Okay.

1982
02:58:53,899 --> 02:58:55,659
So I just need to, I need to sell.

1983
02:58:56,700 --> 02:58:57,579
I have that guitar.

1984
02:58:58,139 --> 02:59:09,209
Apparently, I can't sell it here.

1985
02:59:16,090 --> 02:59:16,329
All right.

1986
02:59:16,329 --> 02:59:17,690
I will turn auto play back on.

1987
02:59:17,690 --> 02:59:18,090
Don't worry.

1988
02:59:21,479 --> 02:59:21,959
I'll get it.

1989
02:59:21,959 --> 02:59:22,280
I'll do it.

1990
02:59:22,280 --> 02:59:22,760
I'll do it.

1991
02:59:22,760 --> 02:59:23,399
Just give me a second.

1992
02:59:24,680 --> 02:59:25,479
Welcome back.

1993
02:59:28,000 --> 02:59:28,559
220.

1994
02:59:28,559 --> 02:59:29,040
I'll take it.

1995
02:59:30,459 --> 02:59:30,860
All right.

1996
02:59:31,920 --> 02:59:32,639
Here we go.

1997
02:59:32,639 --> 02:59:33,920
Let's get the auto play back on.

1998
02:59:44,969 --> 02:59:54,760
Count Dracula music time.

1999
02:59:54,760 --> 02:59:55,260
All right.

2000
02:59:58,780 --> 02:59:59,180
Jaws?

2001
03:00:03,180 --> 03:00:05,100
Why is this a horror movie theme song?

2002
03:00:06,780 --> 03:00:07,180
Let's go.

2003
03:00:50,059 --> 03:00:52,940
This is, this is, what is it?

2004
03:00:53,579 --> 03:00:54,299
Michael Myers.

2005
03:00:54,299 --> 03:00:54,700
No, it's not.

2006
03:00:54,700 --> 03:01:04,680
What is it?

2007
03:01:04,680 --> 03:01:05,639
The Exorcist, right?

2008
03:01:12,270 --> 03:01:13,709
Somebody stop him.

2009
03:01:13,709 --> 03:01:14,590
I just did the other one.

2010
03:01:17,760 --> 03:01:18,799
They following me out here?

2011
03:01:24,059 --> 03:01:25,340
How long is this video?

2012
03:01:25,340 --> 03:01:26,299
This is a long one.

2013
03:01:30,590 --> 03:01:31,309
I know this one.

2014
03:01:31,870 --> 03:01:32,670
This is soft.

2015
03:01:33,790 --> 03:01:34,590
And it's loud.

2016
03:01:35,549 --> 03:01:50,940
Please like if you enjoyed the music.

2017
03:01:50,940 --> 03:01:51,579
Okay.

2018
03:01:51,579 --> 03:01:52,780
Well, I don't know what the next thing is.

2019
03:01:55,500 --> 03:01:56,540
No, no, no, no.

2020
03:01:56,540 --> 03:01:57,739
No, no, no, no, no.

2021
03:01:57,739 --> 03:01:59,500
I don't want to, I don't want to listen to this one.

2022
03:02:00,860 --> 03:02:03,370
The thing that's coming up here in a second.

2023
03:02:04,090 --> 03:02:10,219
Oh, no, no, it's not.

2024
03:02:10,219 --> 03:02:11,020
Oh, wait, what is this?

2025
03:02:12,299 --> 03:02:14,379
I just saw like the guy like, we need your help.

2026
03:02:14,379 --> 03:02:15,180
Whatever his name is.

2027
03:02:15,180 --> 03:02:16,059
And he was like one here.

2028
03:02:16,059 --> 03:02:16,540
He's up there.

2029
03:02:26,479 --> 03:02:27,120
Okay.

2030
03:02:27,120 --> 03:02:30,319
So I'm going to break into, let's go to one.

2031
03:02:30,319 --> 03:02:33,040
Oh, we've terrorized these people for long enough.

2032
03:02:39,959 --> 03:02:41,159
It's Ghostbusters.

2033
03:02:41,879 --> 03:03:06,350
Come on.

2034
03:03:07,819 --> 03:03:08,940
I'm going to turn this off.

2035
03:03:08,940 --> 03:03:09,440
Get.

2036
03:03:23,469 --> 03:03:24,270
That's an advocate.

2037
03:03:24,270 --> 03:03:24,770
Hold on.

2038
03:03:26,909 --> 03:03:27,870
Keep auto play.

2039
03:03:27,870 --> 03:03:28,670
Auto play is on.

2040
03:03:28,670 --> 03:03:29,549
I just skipped the track.

2041
03:03:30,110 --> 03:03:32,829
This is Nintendo me theme.

2042
03:03:41,579 --> 03:03:43,290
Okay.

2043
03:03:43,290 --> 03:03:43,850
This works.

2044
03:03:51,899 --> 03:04:02,459
I need a task, man.

2045
03:04:02,459 --> 03:04:34,000
I'm like, I don't know what to say right now.

2046
03:04:35,340 --> 03:04:37,979
Just sounds like this is like a Wii Sports menu.

2047
03:04:40,190 --> 03:04:40,750
What was that?

2048
03:04:43,229 --> 03:04:43,790
What?

2049
03:04:43,790 --> 03:04:46,700
A seat?

2050
03:04:46,700 --> 03:04:58,049
How do I get in their house?

2051
03:05:14,110 --> 03:05:15,709
I have to, I'm going to turn it off.

2052
03:05:22,459 --> 03:05:22,700
No.

2053
03:05:22,700 --> 03:05:23,500
What do you mean no?

2054
03:05:29,090 --> 03:05:30,610
I can't stand it anymore.

2055
03:05:30,610 --> 03:05:31,569
I have to turn it off.

2056
03:05:35,100 --> 03:05:36,860
I have to turn this off.

2057
03:05:39,920 --> 03:05:40,479
E?

2058
03:05:40,479 --> 03:05:41,920
I got an E.

2059
03:05:41,920 --> 03:05:42,559
What is E?

2060
03:05:43,950 --> 03:05:44,670
What is an E?

2061
03:05:54,500 --> 03:05:56,180
That's going to make me lose my mind.

2062
03:05:56,819 --> 03:05:58,020
I'm losing my mind.

2063
03:06:01,090 --> 03:06:02,930
Oh, is this like 40 minutes?

2064
03:06:03,729 --> 03:06:08,670
Do I, can I level up?

2065
03:06:08,670 --> 03:06:09,389
I can level up.

2066
03:06:10,420 --> 03:06:12,659
I think this might be like four hour remix.

2067
03:06:13,540 --> 03:06:13,940
Oh, hold on.

2068
03:06:13,940 --> 03:06:14,659
I'm getting lightheaded.

2069
03:06:14,659 --> 03:06:15,139
I gotta stop.

2070
03:06:18,159 --> 03:06:18,479
Okay.

2071
03:06:18,479 --> 03:06:21,139
I need lock picking three.

2072
03:06:26,319 --> 03:06:27,360
Vinny, what do you have to say?

2073
03:06:44,750 --> 03:06:46,510
Break or steal a big TV.

2074
03:06:47,389 --> 03:06:49,469
Oh, wait, I need like the device.

2075
03:06:54,190 --> 03:06:55,950
Somebody come to the stream.

2076
03:06:56,590 --> 03:06:58,110
Oh, thank God it's over.

2077
03:06:58,989 --> 03:07:01,229
Oh, I feel bad for the new people that come in

2078
03:07:01,229 --> 03:07:03,469
and just think I'm fucking weirdo.

2079
03:07:03,469 --> 03:07:05,069
Why am I listening to this?

2080
03:07:06,479 --> 03:07:09,200
No, it's going to play like a League of Legends remix.

2081
03:07:13,790 --> 03:07:14,989
I don't know what the next thing is.

2082
03:07:15,790 --> 03:07:19,950
All right, I need, do I need a new thing?

2083
03:07:24,020 --> 03:07:29,059
I don't have enough money for the lockpick.

2084
03:07:29,780 --> 03:07:35,950
All right.

2085
03:07:35,950 --> 03:07:37,229
This is just like Beethoven.

2086
03:07:44,639 --> 03:07:46,479
I think I need to make more money.

2087
03:07:46,479 --> 03:08:17,950
I hate this.

2088
03:08:17,950 --> 03:08:18,989
I hate this.

2089
03:08:31,329 --> 03:08:33,920
Oh, no, I have to turn it off.

2090
03:08:33,920 --> 03:08:34,799
I can't stand it.

2091
03:08:35,760 --> 03:08:36,959
I can't stand it.

2092
03:08:38,399 --> 03:08:39,629
What do I need to do?

2093
03:08:39,629 --> 03:08:40,430
Break the TV.

2094
03:08:40,430 --> 03:08:41,469
It's 500 bucks.

2095
03:08:41,469 --> 03:08:42,350
Open the fucking door.

2096
03:08:52,139 --> 03:08:52,860
Open your door.

2097
03:08:53,659 --> 03:08:54,219
Come on.

2098
03:08:54,940 --> 03:09:13,860
What?

2099
03:09:13,860 --> 03:09:14,579
What the what?

2100
03:09:15,459 --> 03:09:42,940
Okay, we're done.

2101
03:09:42,940 --> 03:09:43,340
Finally.

2102
03:09:45,120 --> 03:09:46,239
We can move on.

2103
03:09:46,239 --> 03:09:47,200
We don't have to listen to this.

2104
03:09:47,760 --> 03:09:49,600
No, no, no.

2105
03:09:49,600 --> 03:09:50,479
I don't want to hear this.

2106
03:09:50,479 --> 03:09:51,760
This is going to ruin everything.

2107
03:09:51,760 --> 03:09:53,680
This will ruin my whole childhood if I listen to this.

2108
03:09:54,879 --> 03:09:55,760
No, don't listen to it.

2109
03:09:56,399 --> 03:09:57,200
I don't want to hear it.

2110
03:10:00,719 --> 03:10:01,760
I don't want to hear this.

2111
03:10:02,399 --> 03:10:15,969
Boy, this one's good.

2112
03:10:15,969 --> 03:10:29,020
This one sounds pretty good.

2113
03:10:29,819 --> 03:10:45,809
You're right.

2114
03:10:45,809 --> 03:10:47,090
It's only remixes.

2115
03:10:48,370 --> 03:10:49,569
I'm skipping like five times.

2116
03:10:52,620 --> 03:10:53,819
Kirby remix.

2117
03:10:55,420 --> 03:10:56,620
Kirby remix.

2118
03:10:57,899 --> 03:10:58,780
Kirby remix.

2119
03:11:00,219 --> 03:11:01,500
The same Kirby remix.

2120
03:11:02,299 --> 03:11:04,219
King Dedede's theme remix.

2121
03:11:05,260 --> 03:11:06,299
Kirby all-stars.

2122
03:11:06,299 --> 03:11:06,780
Now I'm on-

2123
03:11:06,780 --> 03:11:08,139
It's not about winning.

2124
03:11:08,139 --> 03:11:09,420
It's about fun.

2125
03:11:09,420 --> 03:11:10,059
What's that?

2126
03:11:10,780 --> 03:11:11,659
Fun is when you-

2127
03:11:12,829 --> 03:11:13,389
Fun is-

2128
03:11:14,430 --> 03:11:14,909
It's like-

2129
03:11:15,709 --> 03:11:16,430
It's kind of-

2130
03:11:17,389 --> 03:11:18,110
Sort of like a-

2131
03:11:18,989 --> 03:11:19,709
What is fun?

2132
03:11:20,350 --> 03:11:20,510
Like-

2133
03:11:21,309 --> 03:11:22,590
Let me spell it for you.

2134
03:11:29,149 --> 03:11:29,870
Get in!

2135
03:11:29,870 --> 03:11:30,350
I got it.

2136
03:11:30,350 --> 03:11:30,750
I got it.

2137
03:11:34,219 --> 03:11:34,940
Where's the TV?

2138
03:11:48,110 --> 03:11:52,299
That's not a big TV.

2139
03:11:52,299 --> 03:12:00,780
What?

2140
03:12:00,780 --> 03:12:01,979
The cop is in the house?

2141
03:12:03,010 --> 03:12:03,649
Get off.

2142
03:12:03,649 --> 03:12:05,069
Turn it off.

2143
03:12:05,069 --> 03:12:05,469
I'm done.

2144
03:12:05,469 --> 03:12:05,870
Turn it off.

2145
03:12:06,510 --> 03:12:13,170
I'm done.

2146
03:12:13,170 --> 03:12:15,010
My overstimulation is over.

2147
03:12:15,010 --> 03:12:35,379
I hate this.

2148
03:12:38,659 --> 03:12:39,059
Okay.

2149
03:12:40,780 --> 03:12:41,020
So.

2150
03:12:42,379 --> 03:12:43,100
I need to get-

2151
03:12:43,899 --> 03:12:45,280
I could have just gone up there.

2152
03:12:54,590 --> 03:12:55,709
I'm so-

2153
03:12:55,709 --> 03:12:56,829
I'm so sorry.

2154
03:12:59,229 --> 03:13:00,110
I couldn't stop it.

2155
03:13:00,670 --> 03:13:04,620
I just had to go for like at least a few minutes.

2156
03:13:04,620 --> 03:13:05,899
I'm just very-

2157
03:13:05,899 --> 03:13:07,260
I'm gonna apologize for that.

2158
03:13:07,260 --> 03:13:07,979
Over and over again.

2159
03:13:08,620 --> 03:13:10,860
I'm gonna park and I'm gonna sleep and I'm gonna steal their TV.

2160
03:13:17,440 --> 03:13:18,079
Remixes.

2161
03:13:18,639 --> 03:13:21,090
Oh, I'm gonna throw up.

2162
03:13:21,729 --> 03:13:30,850
This is a remix for every single thing.

2163
03:13:31,649 --> 03:13:32,479
Okay.

2164
03:13:32,479 --> 03:13:33,680
I gotta turn this down though.

2165
03:13:33,680 --> 03:13:34,559
This is not allowed.

2166
03:13:34,559 --> 03:13:35,840
It is absolute hell.

2167
03:13:36,479 --> 03:13:42,030
All right.

2168
03:13:42,030 --> 03:13:43,149
Let's wait until they're asleep.

2169
03:13:43,790 --> 03:13:59,520
I don't even know why that-

2170
03:13:59,520 --> 03:14:01,760
Oh, because we played the pink panther music.

2171
03:14:02,479 --> 03:14:06,510
All right.

2172
03:14:06,510 --> 03:14:08,270
I need to see when they're home.

2173
03:14:08,270 --> 03:14:08,989
They're asleep.

2174
03:14:09,870 --> 03:14:10,909
Leave the lights around in here.

2175
03:14:12,290 --> 03:14:13,489
TV's in that room.

2176
03:14:13,489 --> 03:14:14,690
I could break it and get out.

2177
03:14:15,409 --> 03:14:16,819
Or I could take it.

2178
03:14:16,819 --> 03:14:17,940
Can I fit it out that window?

2179
03:14:18,500 --> 03:14:22,940
It's possible that I could even fit it through the window.

2180
03:14:24,290 --> 03:14:24,930
Definitely not.

2181
03:14:24,930 --> 03:14:25,569
I have to just break it.

2182
03:14:25,569 --> 03:14:27,409
I'm gonna put it in a different room and break it.

2183
03:14:27,409 --> 03:14:28,899
Somebody in that one.

2184
03:14:29,620 --> 03:14:31,379
I can't even open this door.

2185
03:14:35,020 --> 03:14:35,420
Come on.

2186
03:14:35,420 --> 03:14:36,620
I can't even open that door.

2187
03:14:36,620 --> 03:14:37,500
I need a level three pick.

2188
03:14:37,500 --> 03:14:38,139
I don't have one.

2189
03:14:39,229 --> 03:14:39,629
All right.

2190
03:14:39,629 --> 03:14:40,110
We're just going-

2191
03:14:40,110 --> 03:14:40,989
We're just gonna steal stuff.

2192
03:14:42,350 --> 03:14:44,459
Try to get some expensive stuff.

2193
03:14:48,639 --> 03:14:50,639
Arrow in the knee dubstep remix.

2194
03:14:51,440 --> 03:14:53,979
Oh, that was a sought after item.

2195
03:14:53,979 --> 03:14:54,299
Router.

2196
03:14:54,299 --> 03:14:54,540
All right.

2197
03:14:54,540 --> 03:14:56,540
I'm not gonna get too cocky here.

2198
03:14:58,940 --> 03:14:59,819
Phase.

2199
03:14:59,819 --> 03:15:00,219
All right.

2200
03:15:01,180 --> 03:15:02,299
One more item and I gotta get out.

2201
03:15:03,180 --> 03:15:06,319
Maybe some money.

2202
03:15:07,280 --> 03:15:08,239
Oh, somebody's in there.

2203
03:15:08,239 --> 03:15:08,559
Hold on.

2204
03:15:10,030 --> 03:15:10,270
All right.

2205
03:15:10,270 --> 03:15:10,989
I got a router.

2206
03:15:11,629 --> 03:15:14,930
I can't-

2207
03:15:14,930 --> 03:15:16,209
Right here, I'll get another router.

2208
03:15:16,770 --> 03:15:17,649
That's two routers.

2209
03:15:19,090 --> 03:15:19,809
That's good enough.

2210
03:15:20,610 --> 03:15:21,649
Anybody outside right now?

2211
03:15:22,209 --> 03:15:25,420
Yeah, I'm good.

2212
03:15:26,059 --> 03:15:31,120
Okay.

2213
03:15:31,120 --> 03:15:31,840
Back to the car.

2214
03:15:31,840 --> 03:15:32,639
Let's sell this stuff.

2215
03:15:36,940 --> 03:15:37,500
Clean job.

2216
03:15:38,139 --> 03:15:40,819
No more fucking around.

2217
03:15:40,819 --> 03:15:41,379
Like, I've just-

2218
03:15:41,379 --> 03:15:42,100
I've let like the-

2219
03:15:42,100 --> 03:15:43,620
Just the bullshit get to me right now.

2220
03:15:44,420 --> 03:15:49,170
I need to sell the routers.

2221
03:15:49,170 --> 03:15:50,209
One of them was sought after.

2222
03:15:52,270 --> 03:15:52,590
Oh.

2223
03:15:53,309 --> 03:16:07,040
What?

2224
03:16:16,299 --> 03:16:16,860
4k-

2225
03:16:16,860 --> 03:16:18,860
Yeah, there's like 4200 people here.

2226
03:16:19,500 --> 03:16:20,850
I hope you guys are having fun.

2227
03:16:21,569 --> 03:16:27,620
Doom.

2228
03:16:27,620 --> 03:16:30,420
Oh, I'm not gonna play the Doom soundtrack.

2229
03:16:33,020 --> 03:16:34,700
I'm not gonna play the Doom soundtrack.

2230
03:16:35,340 --> 03:16:45,940
Do I have-

2231
03:16:45,940 --> 03:16:47,780
Do I have to play the Doom soundtrack?

2232
03:16:48,340 --> 03:16:50,420
Break the toilet in 105.

2233
03:16:50,420 --> 03:16:50,659
Sure.

2234
03:16:51,379 --> 03:16:53,090
Break the dishes.

2235
03:16:53,090 --> 03:16:53,969
Break the toilet.

2236
03:16:53,969 --> 03:16:55,329
Break all their glasses.

2237
03:16:55,329 --> 03:16:56,450
Can I do something that's not-

2238
03:16:56,450 --> 03:16:57,409
Smashing shit?

2239
03:16:58,129 --> 03:17:01,090
I don't want to just break everything.

2240
03:17:04,059 --> 03:17:04,299
All right.

2241
03:17:04,299 --> 03:17:05,579
I need some security tips.

2242
03:17:06,139 --> 03:17:08,219
They leave the balcony door open and I need-

2243
03:17:08,219 --> 03:17:09,100
I want their routines.

2244
03:17:09,100 --> 03:17:09,899
There's no one at home.

2245
03:17:10,459 --> 03:17:13,420
There is no one home between 11 and 2 at 105.

2246
03:17:16,049 --> 03:17:17,010
Possible loot location.

2247
03:17:17,010 --> 03:17:18,450
They bought a pricey painting.

2248
03:17:18,450 --> 03:17:19,489
Why am I paying for this?

2249
03:17:24,100 --> 03:17:24,739
All right.

2250
03:17:24,739 --> 03:17:25,729
Fine.

2251
03:17:25,729 --> 03:17:28,799
You're gonna have to give the people what they want, right?

2252
03:17:49,489 --> 03:18:40,620
Okay, that was Doom theme sped up by 1.5 times

2253
03:18:40,620 --> 03:18:41,899
and then I put it up times too.

2254
03:18:43,489 --> 03:18:43,889
There you go.

2255
03:18:44,530 --> 03:18:45,409
I hope you liked it.

2256
03:19:00,459 --> 03:19:01,659
Please pay attention.

2257
03:19:07,649 --> 03:19:08,370
That wasn't me laughing.

2258
03:19:08,370 --> 03:19:10,530
That was me for doing the trumpet

2259
03:19:10,530 --> 03:19:12,209
that we played for five seconds there.

2260
03:19:17,440 --> 03:19:18,239
All right.

2261
03:19:18,239 --> 03:19:19,200
There's a lot of-

2262
03:19:19,200 --> 03:19:20,959
I'm not gonna do the 108 yet.

2263
03:19:20,959 --> 03:19:23,170
We're gonna go back to-

2264
03:19:23,170 --> 03:19:25,329
I don't know what to do with 104, man, but seriously.

2265
03:19:25,329 --> 03:19:25,569
All right.

2266
03:19:25,569 --> 03:19:30,610
So 105, I need to break the toilet and break their TV.

2267
03:19:31,329 --> 03:19:36,450
So I need to get sleep in the car starting at 9 p.m.

2268
03:19:37,250 --> 03:19:40,930
I got until 2 a.m.

2269
03:19:40,930 --> 03:19:41,889
From 9 p-

2270
03:19:41,889 --> 03:19:44,500
No, from 11 p.m.

2271
03:19:45,139 --> 03:19:46,180
Until 2 a.m.

2272
03:19:47,280 --> 03:19:48,399
It's empty.

2273
03:19:48,399 --> 03:19:50,479
I can do whatever the hell I want in 105.

2274
03:20:07,219 --> 03:20:08,899
You can sleep backwards.

2275
03:20:08,899 --> 03:20:10,180
How do you go to bed backwards?

2276
03:20:13,260 --> 03:20:13,739
All right.

2277
03:20:14,379 --> 03:20:27,840
So 105, it is-

2278
03:20:27,840 --> 03:20:29,680
Well, we need 11 p.m.

2279
03:20:30,479 --> 03:20:32,979
We gotta be out by like 1 30.

2280
03:20:33,700 --> 03:20:35,860
Break the toilet and break their TV.

2281
03:20:36,420 --> 03:20:41,889
So here is 105.

2282
03:20:43,149 --> 03:20:43,629
There it is.

2283
03:20:44,270 --> 03:20:45,819
Just wait for them to leave.

2284
03:20:48,100 --> 03:20:49,860
Is there something I can climb in here?

2285
03:20:49,860 --> 03:20:54,500
Okay, I can break in here, climb up the vine, TV, bathroom.

2286
03:20:56,059 --> 03:20:59,100
Now we just have to be patient until 11 p.m.

2287
03:21:01,069 --> 03:21:01,629
Here they come.

2288
03:21:02,270 --> 03:21:04,690
Shut the door.

2289
03:21:05,329 --> 03:21:07,100
No, I need to be able to get in there quick.

2290
03:21:07,819 --> 03:21:13,520
Hydrate.

2291
03:21:13,520 --> 03:21:14,399
Come on.

2292
03:21:14,399 --> 03:21:22,399
Count it down here.

2293
03:21:22,399 --> 03:21:23,520
10, 10, 45.

2294
03:21:24,159 --> 03:21:28,110
I'm just gonna be standing outside their house.

2295
03:21:35,440 --> 03:21:36,559
They come out the front door?

2296
03:21:39,139 --> 03:21:40,500
What about this here?

2297
03:21:41,780 --> 03:21:42,340
When are they here?

2298
03:21:42,979 --> 03:21:45,139
No, that's this hard.

2299
03:21:45,139 --> 03:21:46,500
This is a lot harder for this house.

2300
03:21:48,739 --> 03:21:49,459
All right, here we go.

2301
03:21:50,260 --> 03:21:52,190
Coming out the front door.

2302
03:21:52,909 --> 03:21:54,510
I'm just standing here.

2303
03:21:54,510 --> 03:21:54,989
I'm just-

2304
03:21:54,989 --> 03:21:55,709
This is what I do.

2305
03:21:56,909 --> 03:21:57,950
All right, you disappeared.

2306
03:21:57,950 --> 03:21:59,149
It is now 11 o'clock.

2307
03:21:59,149 --> 03:22:00,829
There's nobody in this house, right?

2308
03:22:01,629 --> 03:22:15,950
This is 105, right?

2309
03:22:17,629 --> 03:22:17,870
Yes.

2310
03:22:18,590 --> 03:22:19,549
Okay, steal.

2311
03:22:20,430 --> 03:22:21,469
I can take it.

2312
03:22:21,469 --> 03:22:22,799
I can actually just take it.

2313
03:22:38,610 --> 03:22:39,969
Play through the fire and flames.

2314
03:22:42,479 --> 03:22:45,520
No, I'm not gonna play through the fire and flames.

2315
03:22:45,520 --> 03:22:47,440
What, from like 2007?

2316
03:22:59,739 --> 03:23:00,540
It's still good.

2317
03:23:00,540 --> 03:23:03,500
I know, it's a good guitar hero song.

2318
03:23:04,219 --> 03:23:07,709
All right, with time, we got a time check.

2319
03:23:07,709 --> 03:23:08,430
12, we're good.

2320
03:23:09,069 --> 03:23:10,239
Nobody coming.

2321
03:23:10,239 --> 03:23:14,979
Okay, we got the TV.

2322
03:23:14,979 --> 03:23:16,260
Now we need to break the toilet.

2323
03:23:17,969 --> 03:23:18,450
Nobody here.

2324
03:23:18,450 --> 03:23:19,010
I can stick-

2325
03:23:19,010 --> 03:23:20,209
Ooh, chessboard.

2326
03:23:20,930 --> 03:23:24,620
That's all I can take, apparently.

2327
03:23:25,180 --> 03:23:29,069
Can I fit more than one thing in the car?

2328
03:23:31,090 --> 03:23:31,809
I wish I could see.

2329
03:23:32,370 --> 03:23:46,450
What's wrong with me?

2330
03:23:47,010 --> 03:23:49,379
All right, we're getting close here.

2331
03:23:49,379 --> 03:23:49,700
I gotta get-

2332
03:23:49,700 --> 03:23:50,500
I gotta hurry up and do this.

2333
03:23:56,899 --> 03:23:57,540
Ow.

2334
03:23:57,540 --> 03:24:07,659
Me serious.

2335
03:24:07,659 --> 03:24:08,940
I can't fit more than one thing in the car.

2336
03:24:08,940 --> 03:24:09,579
What's worth more?

2337
03:24:10,299 --> 03:24:13,940
This one is 10 experience.

2338
03:24:15,120 --> 03:24:18,530
And if I can't have it, nobody can.

2339
03:24:19,649 --> 03:24:28,659
Break the toilet.

2340
03:24:54,129 --> 03:24:54,450
No!

2341
03:24:55,409 --> 03:24:56,129
No!

2342
03:24:56,129 --> 03:24:56,530
What?

2343
03:24:57,170 --> 03:24:57,489
No!

2344
03:24:58,530 --> 03:24:58,770
No!

2345
03:24:59,329 --> 03:25:04,319
How?

2346
03:25:04,319 --> 03:25:05,200
How did this happen?

2347
03:25:06,770 --> 03:25:07,409
Get me out of here.

2348
03:25:07,409 --> 03:25:07,809
Come on!

2349
03:25:08,610 --> 03:25:39,790
It doesn't-

2350
03:25:39,790 --> 03:25:46,379
I don't understand.

2351
03:25:46,379 --> 03:25:53,920
How did I even get in here?

2352
03:25:53,920 --> 03:25:55,139
Lean out.

2353
03:25:55,139 --> 03:25:55,860
Lean out.

2354
03:25:56,420 --> 03:25:56,739
Lean-

2355
03:25:56,739 --> 03:25:58,659
Freeze!

2356
03:25:58,659 --> 03:26:16,129
I don't even know how I got stuck in there.

2357
03:26:16,129 --> 03:26:19,360
I turned the corner and like I bumped into the-

2358
03:26:19,360 --> 03:26:28,909
I'm gonna have to do that again.

2359
03:26:28,909 --> 03:26:29,469
I have to-

2360
03:26:29,469 --> 03:26:30,110
What is it?

2361
03:26:30,110 --> 03:26:31,389
Nine, 10 o'clock.

2362
03:26:31,389 --> 03:26:32,110
God.

2363
03:26:32,110 --> 03:26:33,389
I'm gonna do it real quick.

2364
03:26:34,190 --> 03:26:35,069
Keep the trunk open.

2365
03:26:35,950 --> 03:26:38,079
That was my fault?

2366
03:26:40,530 --> 03:26:41,889
Why was it my fault?

2367
03:26:42,829 --> 03:26:45,309
Because I ran and bumped into the wall?

2368
03:26:54,940 --> 03:26:56,379
You should have fl-

2369
03:26:56,379 --> 03:26:57,579
Your ass is too big.

2370
03:27:02,399 --> 03:27:11,409
I should have just slept till-

2371
03:27:11,409 --> 03:27:12,930
I'm just gonna go sleep till 11.

2372
03:27:16,379 --> 03:27:17,260
Park next to the house.

2373
03:27:17,260 --> 03:27:18,219
No, that's suspicious.

2374
03:27:19,100 --> 03:27:19,819
That's suspicious.

2375
03:27:19,819 --> 03:27:20,379
I can't do that.

2376
03:27:20,940 --> 03:27:26,459
No, sleep in the car.

2377
03:27:36,239 --> 03:27:37,440
Park in their garage.

2378
03:27:38,079 --> 03:27:39,200
I can't even open their garage.

2379
03:27:39,200 --> 03:27:41,360
I don't have a garage door opener, guys.

2380
03:27:42,079 --> 03:27:49,200
Let's make this quick.

2381
03:27:49,200 --> 03:28:04,610
Break the toilet first.

2382
03:28:05,090 --> 03:28:06,690
I know, I know.

2383
03:28:06,690 --> 03:28:08,290
I know I should have done that.

2384
03:28:08,290 --> 03:28:09,729
Why am I doing it like this?

2385
03:28:11,409 --> 03:28:12,930
Toilet first, you muppet.

2386
03:28:14,590 --> 03:28:15,790
But it was-

2387
03:28:15,790 --> 03:28:16,350
I had-

2388
03:28:16,350 --> 03:28:17,549
Ah, forget it.

2389
03:28:18,110 --> 03:28:19,229
Get the TV to last.

2390
03:28:19,229 --> 03:28:20,750
I know, I know these things.

2391
03:28:20,750 --> 03:28:23,069
But I'm so stupid that I did it in the reverse order.

2392
03:28:23,790 --> 03:28:42,739
I'm gonna walk very slowly through this house.

2393
03:28:43,379 --> 03:28:51,950
Okay, nice and safe.

2394
03:28:51,950 --> 03:28:52,430
We're good.

2395
03:28:52,989 --> 03:28:53,950
Turn off the flashlight.

2396
03:28:57,069 --> 03:28:58,590
What is blinking over here?

2397
03:28:58,590 --> 03:28:59,709
Oh, break or steal the-

2398
03:28:59,709 --> 03:29:00,829
All right, can I take money?

2399
03:29:00,829 --> 03:29:01,549
Yeah, I'll take it.

2400
03:29:02,829 --> 03:29:04,670
I can't take the stereo or the receiver.

2401
03:29:06,110 --> 03:29:07,149
Can't take anything else.

2402
03:29:07,790 --> 03:29:08,780
I can take-

2403
03:29:08,780 --> 03:29:09,420
No, I can't take this.

2404
03:29:09,420 --> 03:29:10,139
It doesn't fit in the car.

2405
03:29:10,700 --> 03:29:18,989
Does anyone want to break people's plates too?

2406
03:29:20,190 --> 03:29:21,149
It's in the other place.

2407
03:29:21,149 --> 03:29:22,270
Okay, that's it, right?

2408
03:29:22,270 --> 03:29:23,309
Good, go, go.

2409
03:29:24,110 --> 03:29:28,500
Somebody's here.

2410
03:29:29,059 --> 03:29:32,420
Forget about the ride.

2411
03:29:32,420 --> 03:29:33,379
Gotta run with the crowbar.

2412
03:29:34,260 --> 03:29:41,139
All right, time to go.

2413
03:29:41,700 --> 03:29:51,280
Other house?

2414
03:29:51,280 --> 03:29:51,680
I need-

2415
03:29:51,680 --> 03:29:53,280
I need more information on those houses.

2416
03:29:56,540 --> 03:29:57,420
Raid the fridge, yeah.

2417
03:29:57,979 --> 03:29:59,020
All right, that was perfect.

2418
03:30:00,299 --> 03:30:01,100
How was that a B?

2419
03:30:01,100 --> 03:30:02,459
I did it exquisitely.

2420
03:30:03,100 --> 03:30:06,780
All right, I gotta sell that TV.

2421
03:30:07,340 --> 03:30:12,940
What do I got?

2422
03:30:12,940 --> 03:30:20,979
$8.95, car parts, electronics, kitchen, other, antiques.

2423
03:30:24,000 --> 03:30:24,959
All this takes place here.

2424
03:30:24,959 --> 03:30:25,840
Okay, $107.

2425
03:30:27,700 --> 03:30:29,780
I can't do $107 until I get the better-

2426
03:30:29,780 --> 03:30:30,899
I don't think I can do either one of these.

2427
03:30:31,620 --> 03:30:35,620
I think I can sneak into $106 if I break the window or something,

2428
03:30:35,620 --> 03:30:38,500
but I need the level three, this one.

2429
03:30:39,219 --> 03:30:41,389
That's $1,200.

2430
03:30:44,670 --> 03:30:45,790
Okay, what do I got for Intel?

2431
03:30:46,110 --> 03:30:48,340
No, $104.

2432
03:30:48,340 --> 03:30:50,340
I got two of these done.

2433
03:30:50,340 --> 03:30:50,899
Nothing to-

2434
03:30:50,899 --> 03:30:52,020
Okay, $106.

2435
03:30:53,250 --> 03:30:55,329
Break the sink, break the dishes, info.

2436
03:30:55,969 --> 03:30:58,610
They leave the window open in the back, right?

2437
03:30:58,610 --> 03:31:01,090
So that's the only time that nobody's there.

2438
03:31:01,889 --> 03:31:03,489
$107, no nothing.

2439
03:31:03,489 --> 03:31:04,770
$108, I know nothing.

2440
03:31:05,329 --> 03:31:06,770
They leave the window open on the second floor.

2441
03:31:06,770 --> 03:31:07,889
I could probably sneak in there.

2442
03:31:08,850 --> 03:31:10,909
Break or steal the big TV?

2443
03:31:10,909 --> 03:31:14,350
I can't know because the TV's in the room with the guy with the harder lock.

2444
03:31:14,350 --> 03:31:14,909
I can't do it.

2445
03:31:19,059 --> 03:31:20,819
Uh, I'm gonna say let's do $106.

2446
03:31:24,979 --> 03:31:28,000
Let's actually stake this place up

2447
03:31:28,559 --> 03:31:31,120
because I need to do break the sink and break the dishes.

2448
03:31:31,120 --> 03:31:33,680
So let's go to $106 after I sell the TV.

2449
03:31:44,319 --> 03:31:47,520
All right, big TV.

2450
03:31:48,239 --> 03:31:49,600
Hopefully it's worth something.

2451
03:31:50,239 --> 03:31:56,190
Here you go.

2452
03:31:56,190 --> 03:31:56,750
Welcome back.

2453
03:31:57,469 --> 03:31:59,340
What do you take for a big TV?

2454
03:31:59,340 --> 03:32:00,139
$120.

2455
03:32:01,020 --> 03:32:03,729
How do I unlock that?

2456
03:32:04,370 --> 03:32:13,379
I won't buy this.

2457
03:32:13,379 --> 03:32:14,260
Wipe it and we'll talk.

2458
03:32:15,059 --> 03:32:21,329
Okay, $106.

2459
03:32:22,290 --> 03:32:23,170
Time for a stakeout.

2460
03:32:31,100 --> 03:32:32,059
Wipe it with a cloth.

2461
03:32:32,860 --> 03:32:34,579
I'm not sure that's how it works.

2462
03:32:35,299 --> 03:32:39,229
It'd be really easy to delete your whole phone that way.

2463
03:32:40,110 --> 03:32:42,610
All right, $106.

2464
03:32:43,250 --> 03:32:46,719
Let's get a good stakeout position.

2465
03:33:08,239 --> 03:33:09,520
All right, so what time is it right now?

2466
03:33:09,520 --> 03:33:12,079
It is currently 2, 11 a.m.

2467
03:33:13,040 --> 03:33:15,920
So I need to find out what these, where they are here now.

2468
03:33:15,920 --> 03:33:17,440
Are they here or are they not here?

2469
03:33:18,159 --> 03:33:22,159
It's a decent question.

2470
03:33:22,719 --> 03:33:24,510
Everything I need to do is upstairs.

2471
03:33:24,510 --> 03:33:25,790
Break the dishes, break the sink.

2472
03:33:28,299 --> 03:33:29,420
And they have a pricey painting.

2473
03:33:29,420 --> 03:33:30,780
They got a lot of stuff in $106.

2474
03:33:38,700 --> 03:33:42,420
$106.

2475
03:33:43,860 --> 03:33:51,139
Front door can be opened and I've got to wait till no one...

2476
03:33:51,780 --> 03:33:53,819
Is no one taking the living room or anything?

2477
03:33:54,459 --> 03:33:58,399
Wait for this person to get out of here.

2478
03:33:59,120 --> 03:34:03,860
This is what purgatory is like.

2479
03:34:03,860 --> 03:34:07,620
There's just nine families and one man just tries to rob you for all eternity.

2480
03:34:11,920 --> 03:34:13,280
Just have to deal with this one guy.

2481
03:34:15,889 --> 03:34:19,010
I would also probably either move or try to catch this person.

2482
03:34:22,209 --> 03:34:23,090
Change the locks.

2483
03:34:23,729 --> 03:34:25,170
Not that that really does anything.

2484
03:34:25,170 --> 03:34:25,729
All right, we're in.

2485
03:34:28,379 --> 03:34:32,879
Okay, so I know that right now, they're going to be getting up fairly soon here.

2486
03:34:32,879 --> 03:34:35,040
So I need to break this sink and break their dishes.

2487
03:34:35,040 --> 03:34:37,680
And then they leave the window open in the back.

2488
03:34:38,399 --> 03:34:41,040
So this window here, okay, this is the painting.

2489
03:34:42,209 --> 03:34:44,049
So should I just get the heck out of here?

2490
03:34:44,049 --> 03:34:44,930
You know what I'm saying?

2491
03:34:44,930 --> 03:34:46,770
I think I'm just going to get the heck out of here with this painting.

2492
03:35:10,379 --> 03:35:11,899
Yeah, I just wanted to see if the...

2493
03:35:11,899 --> 03:35:14,540
I was seeing if the toilet was down here, but they're all upstairs.

2494
03:35:15,340 --> 03:35:18,579
But I can get intel.

2495
03:35:18,579 --> 03:35:19,219
Hold on.

2496
03:35:19,219 --> 03:35:19,719
Intel.

2497
03:35:34,340 --> 03:35:35,219
I can't get intel here?

2498
03:35:35,860 --> 03:35:37,260
Let me go get it.

2499
03:35:37,979 --> 03:35:39,110
Okay.

2500
03:35:39,489 --> 03:35:42,479
That guy's not going to wake up.

2501
03:35:42,479 --> 03:35:43,120
Okay, I got to...

2502
03:35:44,079 --> 03:35:44,879
They're really...

2503
03:35:44,879 --> 03:35:46,479
I don't think there's any real window there.

2504
03:35:47,200 --> 03:35:52,770
Here's what I'm going to do.

2505
03:35:53,409 --> 03:35:55,170
We're going to prop the door open.

2506
03:35:56,690 --> 03:35:57,190
Don't!

2507
03:35:57,809 --> 03:35:58,850
Okay, they're fine.

2508
03:35:58,850 --> 03:36:02,860
I'm going to get this out the door, like right here.

2509
03:36:03,819 --> 03:36:05,020
And then we're going to go for a...

2510
03:36:05,020 --> 03:36:08,559
We're going to smash the sink, smash the dishes.

2511
03:36:08,559 --> 03:36:10,639
And we'll sprint out of the house as fast as we can.

2512
03:36:11,360 --> 03:36:13,649
Here we go.

2513
03:36:13,649 --> 03:36:14,149
Ready?

2514
03:36:23,950 --> 03:36:24,590
What do you think?

2515
03:36:43,059 --> 03:36:43,620
Toilet.

2516
03:36:44,340 --> 03:36:46,020
I'm not going back to the toilet.

2517
03:36:46,020 --> 03:36:47,139
I ain't going to lose.

2518
03:36:47,139 --> 03:36:50,860
Have they not hear that?

2519
03:36:50,860 --> 03:36:51,739
It was all the way upstairs.

2520
03:36:52,299 --> 03:36:54,379
They probably thought it was the cat.

2521
03:36:54,379 --> 03:37:05,809
Let's get out.

2522
03:37:06,989 --> 03:37:07,389
Good.

2523
03:37:07,389 --> 03:37:08,110
Nice and clean.

2524
03:37:08,110 --> 03:37:09,229
Look, I'm getting the hang of this.

2525
03:37:11,809 --> 03:37:13,170
I'm figuring this out real quick.

2526
03:37:13,809 --> 03:37:15,069
You know what I'm saying?

2527
03:37:23,899 --> 03:37:24,940
After four hours?

2528
03:37:25,659 --> 03:37:27,940
Yeah, but hold on.

2529
03:37:27,940 --> 03:37:29,700
You got to give me a little bit of credit here.

2530
03:37:31,260 --> 03:37:34,139
Like 30 or 40 minutes of this was like

2531
03:37:34,139 --> 03:37:37,260
losing our minds like on acid to Pink Panther remixes.

2532
03:37:37,260 --> 03:37:38,139
So I don't...

2533
03:37:38,139 --> 03:37:39,260
You know what I'm saying?

2534
03:37:39,260 --> 03:37:40,430
Does that count?

2535
03:37:49,469 --> 03:37:50,030
1,500.

2536
03:37:50,030 --> 03:37:50,750
Let's get it.

2537
03:37:50,750 --> 03:37:53,489
All right.

2538
03:37:53,489 --> 03:37:54,290
I got the lockpick.

2539
03:37:54,290 --> 03:37:56,049
Now we can test it out.

2540
03:37:56,049 --> 03:37:58,530
I got the electrical lockpick.

2541
03:37:59,409 --> 03:38:00,530
So now I can...

2542
03:38:00,530 --> 03:38:00,770
Is there...

2543
03:38:00,770 --> 03:38:02,370
Can I test it on something?

2544
03:38:02,370 --> 03:38:07,579
I don't have like a training thing,

2545
03:38:08,299 --> 03:38:10,909
but I do have the new gear.

2546
03:38:10,909 --> 03:38:14,430
So I'm allowed to do it because now I can...

2547
03:38:15,469 --> 03:38:15,870
All right.

2548
03:38:15,870 --> 03:38:17,389
Lockpicking four.

2549
03:38:17,389 --> 03:38:18,670
Here's lockpicking three.

2550
03:38:18,670 --> 03:38:20,030
So I have what I need.

2551
03:38:20,030 --> 03:38:20,909
I have a point though.

2552
03:38:21,549 --> 03:38:23,760
25% more backpack space.

2553
03:38:24,319 --> 03:38:28,059
I mean, that's just good.

2554
03:38:28,780 --> 03:38:32,319
I mean, that's just good.

2555
03:38:32,319 --> 03:38:33,040
I'll just take it.

2556
03:38:36,100 --> 03:38:36,819
All right.

2557
03:38:36,819 --> 03:38:41,299
Let's go to 108 and break in there after we pawn the TV.

2558
03:38:46,079 --> 03:38:48,799
This game is like watching paint get a license at the DMV.

2559
03:38:49,680 --> 03:38:51,440
That'd be really, really entertaining.

2560
03:38:52,500 --> 03:38:53,620
That'd be awesome.

2561
03:38:53,620 --> 03:38:54,979
Can you imagine that?

2562
03:38:54,979 --> 03:38:59,020
Think of what would need to happen for that to be a reality.

2563
03:38:59,819 --> 03:39:02,049
So much going on there.

2564
03:39:02,049 --> 03:39:03,010
I would have a ton of questions.

2565
03:39:07,059 --> 03:39:07,780
Welcome back.

2566
03:39:08,420 --> 03:39:10,959
350 bucks.

2567
03:39:11,760 --> 03:39:12,319
I'll take it.

2568
03:39:12,959 --> 03:39:21,260
All right.

2569
03:39:21,260 --> 03:39:22,059
Break into 108.

2570
03:39:22,700 --> 03:39:25,069
How do you wipe the drive?

2571
03:39:25,069 --> 03:39:26,909
Probably with like an electronic hacking kit.

2572
03:39:27,709 --> 03:39:28,350
I would assume.

2573
03:39:28,989 --> 03:39:36,510
So how was it pronounced?

2574
03:39:36,510 --> 03:39:38,989
Is it is it jup or jup?

2575
03:39:38,989 --> 03:39:39,629
It is jup.

2576
03:39:40,510 --> 03:39:42,270
Because it's short for Jupiter.

2577
03:39:42,270 --> 03:39:43,069
So it is jup.

2578
03:39:48,530 --> 03:39:49,069
All right.

2579
03:39:49,069 --> 03:39:50,350
I need to case out 108.

2580
03:39:56,979 --> 03:39:57,299
Wrong.

2581
03:39:59,389 --> 03:39:59,549
Yeah.

2582
03:39:59,549 --> 03:40:00,350
We all love that.

2583
03:40:00,350 --> 03:40:02,350
We all love that big planet Jupiter.

2584
03:40:02,350 --> 03:40:02,670
Don't we?

2585
03:40:03,549 --> 03:40:07,569
Parking space right here.

2586
03:40:14,209 --> 03:40:16,770
Only real germamites know the truth.

2587
03:40:19,200 --> 03:40:19,440
Yeah.

2588
03:40:19,440 --> 03:40:19,760
Come on.

2589
03:40:20,559 --> 03:40:22,399
You guys, you got to be like a real germamite.

2590
03:40:34,239 --> 03:40:34,639
All right.

2591
03:40:34,639 --> 03:40:35,200
Time to case.

2592
03:40:38,579 --> 03:40:39,540
I don't know anything.

2593
03:40:40,260 --> 03:40:42,399
They leave the window open on the second floor.

2594
03:40:42,399 --> 03:40:43,200
That's good to know.

2595
03:40:45,700 --> 03:40:47,780
Like how the gift creator says jup.

2596
03:40:47,780 --> 03:40:49,379
So we can ignore you.

2597
03:40:49,379 --> 03:40:53,180
I mean, come on.

2598
03:40:53,180 --> 03:40:56,459
Are you really going to put like a rhesus rheses argument in front of me here?

2599
03:40:57,420 --> 03:40:58,219
Say whatever you want.

2600
03:40:58,780 --> 03:40:59,899
Okay.

2601
03:40:59,899 --> 03:41:01,180
We'll get some intel.

2602
03:41:01,180 --> 03:41:08,100
Now I want to go get a bag of rheses pcs and bring them up here.

2603
03:41:08,100 --> 03:41:08,739
You need them.

2604
03:41:08,739 --> 03:41:19,329
This can be open.

2605
03:41:19,329 --> 03:41:20,450
This is a simple lock.

2606
03:41:20,450 --> 03:41:21,889
Nobody around, right?

2607
03:41:21,889 --> 03:41:22,290
Let's go.

2608
03:41:27,139 --> 03:41:27,780
Whoa.

2609
03:41:27,780 --> 03:41:35,549
Wasn't very simple, was it?

2610
03:41:35,549 --> 03:41:35,790
All right.

2611
03:41:35,790 --> 03:41:43,659
We're gonna find a person.

2612
03:41:44,299 --> 03:41:48,319
Nothing in the garage.

2613
03:41:48,879 --> 03:41:50,639
Not that I can see.

2614
03:41:51,680 --> 03:41:56,110
I want a brick.

2615
03:41:56,110 --> 03:41:57,629
I've not seen a brick the whole time.

2616
03:42:03,260 --> 03:42:03,819
Holy shit.

2617
03:42:03,819 --> 03:42:06,139
This game is just actually Skyrim.

2618
03:42:06,139 --> 03:42:13,899
Oh, you didn't even come on me.

2619
03:42:13,899 --> 03:42:14,459
Like really?

2620
03:42:37,200 --> 03:42:38,159
Let's watch from a distance.

2621
03:42:38,719 --> 03:42:42,540
Are they still looking at me?

2622
03:42:43,180 --> 03:42:57,520
Somebody make an entrance here.

2623
03:42:57,520 --> 03:43:01,149
I'm watching that tail end here.

2624
03:43:01,149 --> 03:43:02,190
I'm going to be careful.

2625
03:43:02,190 --> 03:43:03,629
What about two stars?

2626
03:43:04,350 --> 03:43:06,879
I've done a good job of hiding.

2627
03:43:06,879 --> 03:43:07,680
Why would I get two?

2628
03:43:14,290 --> 03:43:17,010
Why would you pronounce it rhesus as rheses?

2629
03:43:17,010 --> 03:43:18,209
It's a name.

2630
03:43:18,209 --> 03:43:19,729
And you should respect the creator

2631
03:43:19,729 --> 03:43:21,170
by pronouncing it correctly.

2632
03:43:26,340 --> 03:43:26,819
Okay.

2633
03:43:26,819 --> 03:43:28,020
We're there watching TV.

2634
03:43:28,899 --> 03:43:32,909
I don't know where the police are,

2635
03:43:32,909 --> 03:43:34,030
but they're apparently still around.

2636
03:43:34,030 --> 03:43:34,270
All right.

2637
03:43:34,270 --> 03:43:36,030
So I know that somebody leaves here.

2638
03:43:36,590 --> 03:43:40,909
Why would you?

2639
03:43:40,909 --> 03:43:41,790
There's no way.

2640
03:43:42,510 --> 03:43:43,979
Okay.

2641
03:43:43,979 --> 03:43:45,979
So I know what they're doing for a little bit.

2642
03:43:48,879 --> 03:43:49,280
Living room.

2643
03:43:49,280 --> 03:43:50,479
They all go in the living room.

2644
03:43:52,850 --> 03:43:57,149
Back window is open on the second floor.

2645
03:43:57,149 --> 03:44:07,840
Who the fuck is opening this?

2646
03:44:08,479 --> 03:44:10,139
Are they leaving?

2647
03:44:10,780 --> 03:44:13,340
I think he's actually leaving.

2648
03:44:13,899 --> 03:44:14,700
They're both leaving.

2649
03:44:23,020 --> 03:44:24,700
Why are they over here?

2650
03:44:24,700 --> 03:44:26,219
What are you police doing?

2651
03:44:26,940 --> 03:44:32,159
How long are you going to do this for?

2652
03:44:32,879 --> 03:44:36,620
Can I climb this?

2653
03:44:37,260 --> 03:44:41,780
All right.

2654
03:44:41,780 --> 03:44:43,299
We're getting to the timeframe now.

2655
03:44:43,299 --> 03:44:44,260
He's out.

2656
03:44:45,059 --> 03:44:47,180
Oh my God.

2657
03:44:47,180 --> 03:44:48,219
Would you go away?

2658
03:44:49,100 --> 03:44:52,000
Is it Jerma or Jerma?

2659
03:44:56,030 --> 03:45:07,780
What else can I even do here?

2660
03:45:19,969 --> 03:45:21,250
I thought I could get away with it.

2661
03:45:24,610 --> 03:45:25,729
Again, he's not on the mini-map.

2662
03:45:30,190 --> 03:45:31,469
I don't understand the whole red

2663
03:45:31,469 --> 03:45:32,270
on the mini-map thing.

2664
03:45:32,750 --> 03:45:39,920
The police cars are the things

2665
03:45:39,920 --> 03:45:40,719
that are red on the mini-map.

2666
03:45:40,719 --> 03:45:44,059
So they just have a regular pedestrian?

2667
03:45:47,549 --> 03:45:47,870
Okay.

2668
03:45:47,870 --> 03:45:48,430
Well, whatever.

2669
03:45:49,149 --> 03:45:49,469
All right.

2670
03:45:49,469 --> 03:45:51,389
Well, it's weird that you can see me

2671
03:45:51,389 --> 03:45:52,430
all the way over there.

2672
03:45:52,430 --> 03:45:55,979
But I need to find out more.

2673
03:45:55,979 --> 03:45:56,940
So what time is it right now?

2674
03:45:58,180 --> 03:45:58,739
8 a.m.

2675
03:45:58,739 --> 03:46:00,420
I already know what they're doing.

2676
03:46:00,420 --> 03:46:01,219
I'm going to get up here.

2677
03:46:01,860 --> 03:46:05,860
Let's see if I can look through a window.

2678
03:46:06,579 --> 03:46:11,819
Somebody be in one of these rooms.

2679
03:46:12,780 --> 03:46:14,180
It's 113.

2680
03:46:14,180 --> 03:46:15,379
I know everything about 113.

2681
03:46:15,379 --> 03:46:16,180
Don't need to do that.

2682
03:46:16,899 --> 03:46:20,020
I need to get that intel again.

2683
03:46:20,340 --> 03:46:21,540
I'm going to go sleep in the car.

2684
03:46:22,260 --> 03:46:23,139
Just wait till night.

2685
03:46:23,860 --> 03:46:36,219
Go sleep in their bed.

2686
03:46:39,520 --> 03:46:41,280
Yeah, I'll go sleep right here.

2687
03:46:42,479 --> 03:46:44,959
Sleep like four hours or so, five hours.

2688
03:46:45,600 --> 03:46:51,379
Let's go to 4 p.m.

2689
03:46:52,020 --> 03:46:58,129
I just want to be able to at least

2690
03:46:58,129 --> 03:46:59,809
because three people in the house is kind of...

2691
03:47:00,450 --> 03:47:01,170
That's going to be hard.

2692
03:47:03,790 --> 03:47:04,670
Anything could be anywhere.

2693
03:47:05,309 --> 03:47:11,059
All right.

2694
03:47:11,059 --> 03:47:12,819
So all right, here we go.

2695
03:47:13,700 --> 03:47:14,899
So two people are out.

2696
03:47:14,899 --> 03:47:16,500
There's only one person in the kitchen right now.

2697
03:47:18,379 --> 03:47:20,860
So at this moment, I could climb up the front.

2698
03:47:21,659 --> 03:47:24,379
I could climb up right now.

2699
03:47:24,379 --> 03:47:26,059
I could climb up the front door, pop that open,

2700
03:47:27,680 --> 03:47:29,360
and then leave out the...

2701
03:47:30,159 --> 03:47:32,780
Yeah, I have to wait till these people are gone.

2702
03:47:33,340 --> 03:47:50,260
I'm going to have to worry about this in just a minute here.

2703
03:47:50,979 --> 03:47:52,340
He's going to be hanging out down there.

2704
03:47:53,409 --> 03:47:54,129
All right, let's do it.

2705
03:47:54,129 --> 03:47:55,090
I don't know how this works.

2706
03:47:55,090 --> 03:47:56,209
I didn't do the tutorial of this.

2707
03:47:56,930 --> 03:48:02,110
Apparently, that's it.

2708
03:48:02,750 --> 03:48:06,350
Uh-oh, somebody's coming home.

2709
03:48:06,350 --> 03:48:08,030
Somebody's home, somebody's home, somebody's home.

2710
03:48:08,030 --> 03:48:08,829
They're coming home right now.

2711
03:48:09,389 --> 03:48:10,350
See if I can time this.

2712
03:48:10,350 --> 03:48:11,069
When they go in the front door,

2713
03:48:11,069 --> 03:48:12,110
I'm going to throw it out there.

2714
03:48:13,200 --> 03:48:14,159
I can't get this out there.

2715
03:48:14,159 --> 03:48:14,719
I can't do it.

2716
03:48:15,780 --> 03:48:16,500
No, it's not going to happen.

2717
03:48:24,030 --> 03:48:24,750
I'm going to do this at night.

2718
03:48:28,750 --> 03:48:29,229
Put it down.

2719
03:48:30,899 --> 03:48:31,540
Really?

2720
03:48:31,540 --> 03:48:32,739
Why is the door not unlocked?

2721
03:48:43,979 --> 03:48:44,940
It'll be right in front.

2722
03:48:46,719 --> 03:48:47,920
They're not going to pick their TV up.

2723
03:48:48,479 --> 03:49:01,069
Just wait till it chills out a little bit,

2724
03:49:01,069 --> 03:49:02,829
and then go pick up the TV and go home.

2725
03:49:07,860 --> 03:49:09,219
You definitely have to do this at night, though,

2726
03:49:09,860 --> 03:49:10,579
and sneak through.

2727
03:49:14,420 --> 03:49:15,620
I'm not going to do it like that.

2728
03:49:15,620 --> 03:49:16,979
I'm just going to go get the TV.

2729
03:49:17,540 --> 03:49:18,500
I'm going to pull a car up.

2730
03:49:33,700 --> 03:49:35,620
Go arrest that guy, not me.

2731
03:49:36,659 --> 03:49:38,579
Arrest the guy that just drove you off the road.

2732
03:49:39,219 --> 03:49:55,540
Do the cops give up?

2733
03:49:56,579 --> 03:49:57,379
Eventually, yeah.

2734
03:49:57,379 --> 03:49:58,180
If you're out of the way.

2735
03:49:58,819 --> 03:50:03,280
We're good, right?

2736
03:50:03,280 --> 03:50:04,319
No, almost.

2737
03:50:05,040 --> 03:50:16,860
It's just like running around in circles.

2738
03:50:16,860 --> 03:50:18,059
I need to go hide somewhere.

2739
03:50:18,940 --> 03:50:21,340
Where is that car driving?

2740
03:50:26,129 --> 03:50:27,250
There's so many bins.

2741
03:50:27,250 --> 03:50:27,649
I know.

2742
03:50:43,659 --> 03:50:44,059
All right.

2743
03:50:47,059 --> 03:50:48,180
Search is now concluded.

2744
03:50:48,739 --> 03:50:50,690
I'm just going to get in this dumb thing.

2745
03:50:54,270 --> 03:50:55,389
So I'll just sit here.

2746
03:50:56,030 --> 03:51:02,979
Don't even tell me that I'm getting in.

2747
03:51:02,979 --> 03:51:04,500
This is why I'm going to get caught.

2748
03:51:04,500 --> 03:51:09,170
We're good.

2749
03:51:09,170 --> 03:51:14,370
Okay, 108.

2750
03:51:14,930 --> 03:51:17,260
Let's go grab that TV.

2751
03:51:23,649 --> 03:51:24,530
There it is.

2752
03:51:24,610 --> 03:51:25,649
The door is still open.

2753
03:51:28,110 --> 03:51:28,750
Free TV.

2754
03:51:30,399 --> 03:51:31,200
Thanks.

2755
03:51:31,200 --> 03:51:37,809
What are you doing?

2756
03:51:37,809 --> 03:51:39,520
Don't break it.

2757
03:51:43,549 --> 03:51:44,590
It's very nice of you.

2758
03:51:44,590 --> 03:51:44,909
Thanks.

2759
03:51:46,799 --> 03:51:48,959
If you found it on the ground, it's legally yours.

2760
03:51:48,959 --> 03:51:49,760
Is that true?

2761
03:51:49,760 --> 03:51:50,799
What's the legality there?

2762
03:51:51,520 --> 03:51:54,989
So if there's just TV on the ground,

2763
03:51:56,780 --> 03:51:57,899
is it legal to pick it up?

2764
03:52:03,729 --> 03:52:04,770
No, of course not.

2765
03:52:04,770 --> 03:52:06,770
Because it's on their property.

2766
03:52:09,600 --> 03:52:11,440
All right, but what if it was on the ground in the street

2767
03:52:12,000 --> 03:52:15,069
for more than three days?

2768
03:52:15,709 --> 03:52:20,270
Then it's yours.

2769
03:52:20,909 --> 03:52:26,420
Don't they have a scenario

2770
03:52:26,979 --> 03:52:29,059
where if you find like a bag of money on the ground,

2771
03:52:30,219 --> 03:52:32,540
you have to bring it to the police.

2772
03:52:32,540 --> 03:52:33,979
Let's say you pulled over on the side of the road,

2773
03:52:33,979 --> 03:52:34,620
you're taking a piss

2774
03:52:34,620 --> 03:52:37,180
because you're on like a 50 hour long road trip or something,

2775
03:52:37,180 --> 03:52:39,340
and there's like a suitcase on the side of the road,

2776
03:52:39,340 --> 03:52:40,540
somewhere in like Nebraska.

2777
03:52:42,459 --> 03:52:44,139
It's like a million dollars in cash.

2778
03:52:45,229 --> 03:52:46,989
You have to bring that to the police station

2779
03:52:46,989 --> 03:52:50,030
and then if nobody claims it within like two weeks,

2780
03:52:50,030 --> 03:52:50,909
you get to keep it, right?

2781
03:52:53,569 --> 03:52:54,290
That's how it works.

2782
03:53:02,139 --> 03:53:04,700
Yeah, you pick up a briefcase full of like 50 grand in cash

2783
03:53:04,700 --> 03:53:06,700
and you immediately call the IRS.

2784
03:53:10,139 --> 03:53:10,940
That's the first thing you do.

2785
03:53:17,899 --> 03:53:23,870
Want someone to see their own necklace at the pawn shop?

2786
03:53:24,770 --> 03:53:26,530
You got to break it down first.

2787
03:53:27,250 --> 03:53:32,020
Okay, learn a phrase of level two.

2788
03:53:32,020 --> 03:53:32,520
All right.

2789
03:53:33,139 --> 03:53:34,340
Yeah, from my understanding is like

2790
03:53:34,340 --> 03:53:36,899
so if you found $50,000 in cash on the side of the road,

2791
03:53:36,899 --> 03:53:39,219
first thing you do, just put it down, call the IRS.

2792
03:53:39,219 --> 03:53:41,299
Say, tell them you found $75,000

2793
03:53:42,020 --> 03:53:47,739
and say, yes, I'd like to report it on my income please.

2794
03:53:47,739 --> 03:53:51,299
What do I need for this?

2795
03:53:55,069 --> 03:53:56,270
So I need one, how many?

2796
03:53:56,270 --> 03:53:58,110
Level nine, one more level almost there.

2797
03:54:05,329 --> 03:54:07,170
And then another thing what you should also do is say,

2798
03:54:07,170 --> 03:54:08,049
oh, by the way, can you like,

2799
03:54:08,049 --> 03:54:09,170
can you just go back and like check

2800
03:54:10,290 --> 03:54:12,930
the last like seven years of my taxes?

2801
03:54:12,930 --> 03:54:15,329
I had really awful bookkeeping

2802
03:54:15,329 --> 03:54:17,250
and can you like just make sure that it was correct?

2803
03:54:20,690 --> 03:54:22,049
Go back like 10 years.

2804
03:54:22,690 --> 03:54:26,610
All right, dual retool.

2805
03:54:26,610 --> 03:54:27,409
I got to get these.

2806
03:54:28,129 --> 03:54:31,969
What if you found five bucks?

2807
03:54:31,969 --> 03:54:33,409
Yeah, call up and report it.

2808
03:54:33,409 --> 03:54:35,420
If you found like a $5 bill on the ground,

2809
03:54:35,420 --> 03:54:36,540
immediately call the IRS.

2810
03:54:37,180 --> 03:54:54,299
What about a penny?

2811
03:54:54,299 --> 03:54:54,799
Yeah.

2812
03:55:00,930 --> 03:55:01,569
What else can I do?

2813
03:55:02,209 --> 03:55:08,459
And make sure you're crying when you call.

2814
03:55:09,180 --> 03:55:12,979
Like if you and your friend split,

2815
03:55:12,979 --> 03:55:14,420
you go to coffee together.

2816
03:55:14,420 --> 03:55:16,180
So you and your friend go up to coffee and,

2817
03:55:16,819 --> 03:55:18,340
you know, hey, I got this man.

2818
03:55:18,340 --> 03:55:20,260
Oh, thanks dude, let me at least go

2819
03:55:20,260 --> 03:55:21,860
and give you like a couple of dollars.

2820
03:55:21,860 --> 03:55:24,500
And you're like, oh, thanks man.

2821
03:55:24,500 --> 03:55:26,579
And he gives you like three bucks in cash

2822
03:55:26,579 --> 03:55:27,540
because you put it on your card.

2823
03:55:28,100 --> 03:55:29,620
You have to call the IRS and cry.

2824
03:55:29,620 --> 03:55:30,500
Like, I'm so sorry.

2825
03:55:31,459 --> 03:55:32,500
I have $3 to report.

2826
03:55:32,500 --> 03:55:33,620
My friend gave it to me.

2827
03:55:33,620 --> 03:55:37,940
We were splitting coffee in a coffee shop.

2828
03:55:37,940 --> 03:55:43,549
All right, let's see, rent a thug.

2829
03:55:43,549 --> 03:55:56,540
Break their window on the second floor

2830
03:55:56,540 --> 03:55:58,299
and break or steal a decoration.

2831
03:55:59,819 --> 03:56:08,979
Okay, somebody really hates the Wilsons.

2832
03:56:08,979 --> 03:56:12,819
Yeah, I just got a dollar.

2833
03:56:15,020 --> 03:56:15,899
Oh, shit.

2834
03:56:15,899 --> 03:56:16,540
I got a dollar.

2835
03:56:24,379 --> 03:56:24,860
Hold on.

2836
03:56:24,860 --> 03:56:26,219
Let me, let me just hold on a second.

2837
03:56:39,520 --> 03:56:41,969
Yeah, yeah, that's me.

2838
03:56:43,780 --> 03:56:44,420
Got a dollar.

2839
03:56:47,229 --> 03:56:48,829
But that's not how it works.

2840
03:56:48,829 --> 03:56:50,110
It's not like it's a rec line.

2841
03:56:50,110 --> 03:56:50,829
Yeah, it's me.

2842
03:56:53,760 --> 03:56:55,120
I get to call every time.

2843
03:56:56,979 --> 03:57:06,940
Oh, it's me.

2844
03:57:23,540 --> 03:57:25,299
No, guys, pay your taxes.

2845
03:57:25,940 --> 03:57:29,819
Pay your taxes and just make sure you stash

2846
03:57:30,540 --> 03:57:32,620
at least like 10 grand of gold under your bed.

2847
03:57:42,610 --> 03:57:50,930
Wait, do I still have a TV in the back of the car?

2848
03:57:51,729 --> 03:58:00,510
No, I got a pawn shop.

2849
03:58:00,510 --> 03:58:01,790
No, 107.

2850
03:58:01,790 --> 03:58:03,739
I got to park it in a different place.

2851
03:58:08,559 --> 03:58:17,649
Yeah, I invested all my money in Spongebob DVDs.

2852
03:58:19,250 --> 03:58:22,049
Do I get like to claim like capital gains for that?

2853
03:58:22,930 --> 03:58:27,059
Spongebob, the season one Spongebob DVD original box,

2854
03:58:27,780 --> 03:58:30,159
I mean, has definitely appreciated in value

2855
03:58:30,159 --> 03:58:31,440
by at least like $40.

2856
03:58:31,440 --> 03:58:32,239
Do I have to claim that?

2857
03:58:32,959 --> 03:58:38,190
All right.

2858
03:58:38,190 --> 03:58:39,549
Oh, I just know I okay.

2859
03:58:39,549 --> 03:58:40,430
I park normally.

2860
03:58:40,430 --> 03:58:41,469
That's going to hurt my brain.

2861
03:58:42,110 --> 03:58:46,879
All right.

2862
03:58:46,879 --> 03:58:47,440
Well, here's the thing.

2863
03:58:47,440 --> 03:58:47,600
Okay.

2864
03:58:47,600 --> 03:58:49,680
So can I claim a capital loss?

2865
03:58:49,680 --> 03:58:51,360
So if the Spongebob DVDs,

2866
03:58:51,360 --> 03:58:54,479
if I buy 150 Spongebob DVDs

2867
03:58:55,360 --> 03:58:56,399
and 10 years from now,

2868
03:58:56,399 --> 03:58:58,159
they're worth like a dollar each

2869
03:58:58,159 --> 03:59:00,079
and I paid like $20 a piece for them.

2870
03:59:00,079 --> 03:59:02,239
Do I get to claim capital losses if I sell them?

2871
03:59:02,239 --> 03:59:04,639
You know, I invested in like 100 Spongebob DVDs

2872
03:59:04,639 --> 03:59:06,079
but I've sold them at a loss.

2873
03:59:06,079 --> 03:59:06,319
All right.

2874
03:59:06,319 --> 03:59:35,579
I got some mid sale.

2875
03:59:35,579 --> 03:59:37,340
Break or steal a decoration?

2876
03:59:37,340 --> 03:59:49,569
Okay.

2877
03:59:49,569 --> 03:59:50,530
Break the toilet.

2878
03:59:50,530 --> 03:59:52,610
Break the window on the second floor and break there.

2879
03:59:52,610 --> 03:59:55,170
This is a $900 job.

2880
03:59:59,360 --> 04:00:01,200
And I know nothing about the Wilsons

2881
04:00:01,200 --> 04:00:02,079
but we're breaking in

2882
04:00:02,799 --> 04:00:12,110
because it is 1 a.m.

2883
04:00:12,670 --> 04:00:13,870
They're probably asleep.

2884
04:00:14,940 --> 04:00:16,219
So actually keep this open.

2885
04:00:17,760 --> 04:00:19,729
So break.

2886
04:00:19,729 --> 04:00:20,770
They got a printer too.

2887
04:00:21,409 --> 04:00:28,270
All right.

2888
04:00:28,270 --> 04:00:29,229
Where's my escape route?

2889
04:00:34,780 --> 04:00:35,500
Why?

2890
04:00:35,500 --> 04:00:36,219
What's going on here?

2891
04:00:36,780 --> 04:00:39,969
Did they hear me take the printer?

2892
04:00:40,610 --> 04:00:42,829
Because they're both upstairs.

2893
04:00:42,829 --> 04:00:43,709
They heard me take the printer.

2894
04:00:44,690 --> 04:00:45,409
All right.

2895
04:00:45,409 --> 04:00:46,530
Where can I throw this over?

2896
04:00:47,329 --> 04:00:56,370
Oh, get the fuck out of here.

2897
04:00:56,370 --> 04:00:56,690
I can't.

2898
04:00:56,690 --> 04:00:57,090
All right.

2899
04:00:57,090 --> 04:00:57,489
Printer.

2900
04:00:58,209 --> 04:00:58,850
Garbage can.

2901
04:01:00,030 --> 04:01:00,989
Now break toilet.

2902
04:01:00,989 --> 04:01:02,510
Break window on the second floor.

2903
04:01:02,510 --> 04:01:02,829
Break the...

2904
04:01:02,829 --> 04:01:03,870
There's so much stuff to break.

2905
04:01:03,870 --> 04:01:05,469
I need to know when they're not going to be here.

2906
04:01:06,030 --> 04:01:07,229
I think I take the printer and run.

2907
04:01:08,030 --> 04:01:18,430
Break the toilet.

2908
04:01:19,069 --> 04:01:20,959
Break their wine glasses.

2909
04:01:20,959 --> 04:01:22,079
This is all spread out.

2910
04:01:22,079 --> 04:01:23,440
I'm going to make sure these doors are all open.

2911
04:01:24,399 --> 04:01:33,620
Okay.

2912
04:01:33,620 --> 04:01:34,180
Break...

2913
04:01:34,180 --> 04:01:36,020
The wine glasses are outside so I'm going to do it last.

2914
04:01:36,020 --> 04:01:42,690
So make sure this is open as well

2915
04:01:42,690 --> 04:01:44,450
just in case I have a panic attack and I need to leave.

2916
04:01:52,379 --> 04:01:52,540
All right.

2917
04:01:52,540 --> 04:01:53,260
Here we go.

2918
04:01:53,260 --> 04:01:53,579
Wine.

2919
04:01:53,579 --> 04:01:54,459
So I get toilet.

2920
04:01:56,399 --> 04:01:56,799
Window.

2921
04:01:56,799 --> 04:01:57,360
Toilet.

2922
04:01:57,360 --> 04:01:57,680
Wine.

2923
04:01:58,319 --> 04:01:59,040
Pop the fence.

2924
04:02:05,329 --> 04:02:07,010
Break the window on the second floor.

2925
04:02:07,010 --> 04:02:07,889
Which window?

2926
04:02:07,889 --> 04:02:11,170
Just break any window or break the window on the second floor.

2927
04:02:11,969 --> 04:02:13,569
Doesn't matter which one.

2928
04:02:14,209 --> 04:02:16,350
You know what I'm saying?

2929
04:02:17,069 --> 04:02:23,059
So if it's any window, then I can break...

2930
04:02:23,059 --> 04:02:24,100
So they're asleep right now.

2931
04:02:24,100 --> 04:02:25,379
So bang, bang.

2932
04:02:25,379 --> 04:02:26,020
Out that door.

2933
04:02:26,659 --> 04:02:28,239
Here we go.

2934
04:02:28,239 --> 04:02:36,940
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

2935
04:02:37,659 --> 04:02:38,219
What happened?

2936
04:02:38,219 --> 04:02:39,180
Why did I teleport?

2937
04:02:39,899 --> 04:02:40,299
Why?

2938
04:02:41,180 --> 04:02:42,780
What in the name of happening?

2939
04:02:43,579 --> 04:02:58,510
Get in the toilet!

2940
04:02:58,510 --> 04:03:04,239
I got the printer.

2941
04:03:04,239 --> 04:03:04,639
I got the printer.

2942
04:03:04,639 --> 04:03:05,680
The printer is fine.

2943
04:03:05,680 --> 04:03:09,059
The printer is right below me.

2944
04:03:09,059 --> 04:03:16,430
Right in front of me here.

2945
04:03:16,430 --> 04:03:17,950
Oh, I didn't break or steal a decoration.

2946
04:03:17,950 --> 04:03:18,750
Oh, it's a different house.

2947
04:03:27,500 --> 04:03:28,540
I'm gonna see the printer.

2948
04:03:29,659 --> 04:03:32,219
The printer on the ground in front of where I'm hiding.

2949
04:03:32,780 --> 04:03:33,739
I wonder where he went.

2950
04:03:34,559 --> 04:03:35,600
No, that's not that smart.

2951
04:03:38,899 --> 04:03:40,500
Oh no, he's looking at the printer.

2952
04:03:52,770 --> 04:03:54,290
The TV's in the car.

2953
04:03:54,290 --> 04:03:55,409
Is the TV in the car?

2954
04:03:55,969 --> 04:03:56,690
I didn't see it.

2955
04:04:03,860 --> 04:04:05,459
No, there's no TV back there.

2956
04:04:05,459 --> 04:04:06,180
Didn't we just look?

2957
04:04:06,899 --> 04:04:11,340
I have a TV back there.

2958
04:04:11,340 --> 04:04:12,139
Don't say that.

2959
04:04:13,780 --> 04:04:14,979
You didn't sell it.

2960
04:04:14,979 --> 04:04:15,459
I didn't?

2961
04:04:31,920 --> 04:04:32,239
Okay.

2962
04:04:37,889 --> 04:04:39,969
I need to be, I gotta make sure this is correct.

2963
04:04:40,770 --> 04:04:42,159
Well, I can't go that way.

2964
04:04:42,879 --> 04:04:45,329
I can't go that way either.

2965
04:04:45,329 --> 04:04:46,530
I gotta wait till these people are all gone.

2966
04:04:47,170 --> 04:05:09,739
Hold on, this is important.

2967
04:05:10,299 --> 04:05:12,209
I think I can do another job here.

2968
04:05:12,930 --> 04:05:21,790
Well, get a better car.

2969
04:05:21,790 --> 04:05:24,110
Why can you only fit one printer in there?

2970
04:05:24,670 --> 04:05:32,989
Shit!

2971
04:05:34,819 --> 04:05:37,860
No, I can't put, I can't put anything else back here.

2972
04:05:55,659 --> 04:05:57,180
What an absolute disgrace.

2973
04:05:57,739 --> 04:06:03,899
But it's okay though, because now, here's what I'm gonna do.

2974
04:06:08,260 --> 04:06:08,739
Easy.

2975
04:06:08,739 --> 04:06:09,139
Hold on.

2976
04:06:09,139 --> 04:06:09,780
This is open.

2977
04:06:12,399 --> 04:06:13,360
107.

2978
04:06:14,079 --> 04:06:15,680
There's something to do here at 108.

2979
04:06:16,399 --> 04:06:19,040
So, break or steal a decoration.

2980
04:06:19,040 --> 04:06:19,840
The car's right there.

2981
04:06:19,840 --> 04:06:20,639
Let's go quickly.

2982
04:06:21,440 --> 04:06:29,170
I need to break something in their house.

2983
04:06:29,729 --> 04:06:32,379
Why is this closed?

2984
04:06:32,940 --> 04:06:33,950
Oh, fuck it.

2985
04:06:34,590 --> 04:06:37,700
They're gonna be like, oh, your car's in a weird place.

2986
04:06:38,340 --> 04:06:44,290
Let's just get out of here.

2987
04:06:44,290 --> 04:06:46,370
I'm gonna bring the TV back anyways.

2988
04:06:47,010 --> 04:07:02,370
You can't put it in the passenger seat?

2989
04:07:02,370 --> 04:07:06,530
What criminal goes in and takes one TV and leaves?

2990
04:07:09,010 --> 04:07:13,969
No, you go, you go find their bed and go onto their bed

2991
04:07:13,969 --> 04:07:17,010
with all the SpongeBob DVDs, all the gold, all the fucking money.

2992
04:07:26,899 --> 04:07:27,620
Welcome back.

2993
04:07:31,219 --> 04:07:32,020
700 bucks.

2994
04:07:32,579 --> 04:07:36,079
I'll take it.

2995
04:07:36,079 --> 04:07:37,680
All right, I got some money now.

2996
04:07:37,680 --> 04:07:40,219
I need a little bit more experience.

2997
04:07:40,219 --> 04:07:40,940
Close this up.

2998
04:07:41,739 --> 04:07:44,500
What do we got now?

2999
04:07:44,500 --> 04:07:46,799
We got 101.

3000
04:07:46,799 --> 04:07:47,600
There's nothing here.

3001
04:07:47,600 --> 04:07:48,239
104.

3002
04:07:48,239 --> 04:07:48,799
We already did it.

3003
04:07:50,590 --> 04:07:51,549
Nothing at 106.

3004
04:07:51,549 --> 04:07:53,629
107 is done.

3005
04:07:54,590 --> 04:07:55,229
108.

3006
04:07:55,229 --> 04:07:56,989
I need to break or steal a decoration.

3007
04:07:57,629 --> 04:08:04,159
On 11, I have nothing else on these.

3008
04:08:04,159 --> 04:08:07,840
I got one break or steal a pair decoration at 113.

3009
04:08:08,719 --> 04:08:14,659
I feel I'll do this one.

3010
04:08:14,659 --> 04:08:16,260
Break or steal a decoration.

3011
04:08:16,260 --> 04:08:17,459
So 108.

3012
04:08:17,459 --> 04:08:19,299
Let's case it out a little bit here.

3013
04:08:20,020 --> 04:08:23,489
I can't believe I played this game for four hours.

3014
04:08:24,129 --> 04:08:30,700
I'm still having fun too.

3015
04:08:30,700 --> 04:08:32,700
This is I'm having like a good time right now.

3016
04:08:32,700 --> 04:08:33,260
This is fun.

3017
04:08:33,899 --> 04:08:42,979
I can't believe it either.

3018
04:08:42,979 --> 04:08:45,950
I'm having like a good time.

3019
04:08:52,989 --> 04:08:58,979
108.

3020
04:09:00,959 --> 04:09:02,239
There's a parking garage.

3021
04:09:04,659 --> 04:09:06,899
Actually, the other one's probably a little bit closer.

3022
04:09:07,700 --> 04:09:14,049
Because I can probably hop the fence back here.

3023
04:09:17,200 --> 04:09:19,360
Let's learn about the people here.

3024
04:09:20,079 --> 04:09:30,430
Okay.

3025
04:09:30,430 --> 04:09:31,549
Break the decoration.

3026
04:09:31,549 --> 04:09:33,389
They leave the window open on the second floor.

3027
04:09:33,389 --> 04:09:34,510
I'm not tall enough to look.

3028
04:09:35,229 --> 04:09:41,860
I don't know where they are now.

3029
04:09:41,860 --> 04:09:44,420
This would be a good time to get some.

3030
04:09:46,129 --> 04:09:47,090
I don't want to break that.

3031
04:09:47,090 --> 04:09:47,969
They'll know.

3032
04:09:48,049 --> 04:09:49,090
They'll freak out about it.

3033
04:09:53,260 --> 04:09:55,100
Somebody look outside or do something.

3034
04:09:55,739 --> 04:10:01,739
Nobody there?

3035
04:10:05,090 --> 04:10:06,049
Is there no one here?

3036
04:10:06,690 --> 04:10:10,540
Okay, there's a person right there.

3037
04:10:10,540 --> 04:10:10,940
All right.

3038
04:10:12,540 --> 04:10:15,500
So it looks like they're all upstairs right now.

3039
04:10:16,379 --> 04:10:21,840
I could probably just sprint, smash, run.

3040
04:10:23,709 --> 04:10:24,030
Yep.

3041
04:10:24,030 --> 04:10:24,750
I'm going for it.

3042
04:10:36,819 --> 04:10:43,840
Where's the car?

3043
04:10:44,559 --> 04:11:09,440
Is that not it?

3044
04:11:16,829 --> 04:11:23,440
Drop it and destroy it.

3045
04:11:23,440 --> 04:11:23,760
Wow.

3046
04:11:23,760 --> 04:11:57,149
Why is it?

3047
04:11:57,149 --> 04:11:57,709
Oh, okay.

3048
04:11:59,309 --> 04:11:59,950
That was it.

3049
04:12:07,059 --> 04:12:07,700
F.

3050
04:12:07,700 --> 04:12:09,649
It's all right.

3051
04:12:09,649 --> 04:12:10,770
Sometimes you get an F.

3052
04:12:10,770 --> 04:12:13,780
No antiques.

3053
04:12:13,780 --> 04:12:14,500
You don't want anything.

3054
04:12:16,079 --> 04:12:16,959
We're almost...

3055
04:12:16,959 --> 04:12:19,760
I need to break or steal the pear decoration from 113.

3056
04:12:19,760 --> 04:12:20,559
And that's all we got.

3057
04:12:21,120 --> 04:12:22,479
We're at the end there.

3058
04:12:23,680 --> 04:12:24,319
I have money.

3059
04:12:24,319 --> 04:12:27,280
Jewelry tools requires appraisal too.

3060
04:12:28,319 --> 04:12:29,600
I can't do it yet.

3061
04:12:29,600 --> 04:12:35,299
Headphones.

3062
04:12:35,940 --> 04:12:40,299
So let's go get that done.

3063
04:12:40,299 --> 04:12:42,139
I'll be the next level to do appraisal.

3064
04:12:42,139 --> 04:12:44,139
And then we're probably going to get some new missions.

3065
04:12:44,139 --> 04:12:45,500
Maybe we'll go to a new neighborhood.

3066
04:12:45,500 --> 04:12:45,979
New neighborhood.

3067
04:12:46,540 --> 04:12:48,159
That'd be interesting.

3068
04:12:54,700 --> 04:12:55,500
Welcome back.

3069
04:12:56,059 --> 04:12:59,920
Okay, bye.

3070
04:13:00,479 --> 04:13:01,889
113.

3071
04:13:02,530 --> 04:13:09,250
Because there's definitely a list of neighborhoods that go underneath that.

3072
04:13:09,250 --> 04:13:20,260
It's 113.

3073
04:13:20,260 --> 04:13:30,180
Is my antenna bent?

3074
04:13:30,180 --> 04:13:31,059
Or is it just like that?

3075
04:13:32,340 --> 04:13:45,459
Here are the rest.

3076
04:13:47,780 --> 04:13:48,340
All right.

3077
04:13:48,340 --> 04:13:48,819
Pocket.

3078
04:13:54,350 --> 04:13:55,309
Well, now it's bent.

3079
04:13:55,309 --> 04:13:55,709
All right.

3080
04:13:55,709 --> 04:13:56,750
113.

3081
04:13:56,750 --> 04:13:58,909
Break or steal the pear decoration.

3082
04:13:59,549 --> 04:14:08,500
What else you got over here?

3083
04:14:10,379 --> 04:14:10,940
Headphones.

3084
04:14:10,940 --> 04:14:11,739
Those are expensive.

3085
04:14:12,379 --> 04:14:15,440
Anybody home?

3086
04:14:16,000 --> 04:14:24,139
No, nobody home.

3087
04:14:25,360 --> 04:14:26,000
See you later.

3088
04:14:29,739 --> 04:14:30,299
There it is.

3089
04:14:31,489 --> 04:14:32,530
Okay, hold on.

3090
04:14:33,250 --> 04:14:35,680
Nobody's going to be here for a long time.

3091
04:14:35,680 --> 04:14:36,319
Take everything.

3092
04:14:37,360 --> 04:14:39,409
My inventory is already full.

3093
04:14:39,969 --> 04:14:42,540
Are you kidding me?

3094
04:14:44,209 --> 04:14:44,930
What the hell?

3095
04:14:44,930 --> 04:14:45,250
Really?

3096
04:14:46,530 --> 04:14:47,250
There's no money?

3097
04:14:49,010 --> 04:14:53,260
What do I have that's so heavy?

3098
04:14:59,280 --> 04:15:00,000
Drop stuff?

3099
04:15:02,370 --> 04:15:03,809
It's probably the guitar that's so heavy.

3100
04:15:04,450 --> 04:15:06,129
The car, there's worth a lot of money though.

3101
04:15:19,739 --> 04:15:20,540
$15.

3102
04:15:20,540 --> 04:15:21,020
It's nothing.

3103
04:15:21,659 --> 04:15:25,379
All right, let's move.

3104
04:15:27,139 --> 04:15:27,950
The router.

3105
04:15:27,950 --> 04:15:28,430
I can't.

3106
04:15:28,430 --> 04:15:29,469
So what's so heavy?

3107
04:15:31,549 --> 04:15:32,270
Lockpicks?

3108
04:15:32,270 --> 04:15:32,909
Front door?

3109
04:15:32,909 --> 04:15:33,149
Key?

3110
04:15:34,110 --> 04:15:36,659
Crowbar?

3111
04:15:37,540 --> 04:15:42,340
The guitar, the bass, and the headphones are very heavy.

3112
04:15:42,899 --> 04:15:45,309
The guitar is extremely heavy.

3113
04:15:48,579 --> 04:15:49,940
Leave them without internet.

3114
04:15:50,899 --> 04:16:02,450
Knife set.

3115
04:16:03,250 --> 04:16:04,770
Can't take the microwave too heavy.

3116
04:16:06,319 --> 04:16:07,040
Tea box.

3117
04:16:08,479 --> 04:16:15,409
Oh, nice house.

3118
04:16:19,200 --> 04:16:20,319
No, give me the TV.

3119
04:16:20,959 --> 04:16:22,000
TV's worth way more.

3120
04:16:22,719 --> 04:16:25,920
Oh, it's a small TV.

3121
04:16:25,920 --> 04:16:26,399
Never mind.

3122
04:16:28,819 --> 04:16:35,020
In fact, all right, I'm good.

3123
04:16:35,020 --> 04:16:35,500
Let's get out.

3124
04:16:38,940 --> 04:16:39,899
Spare key for the bed.

3125
04:16:39,899 --> 04:16:40,860
Wait, give me the spare key.

3126
04:16:47,260 --> 04:16:48,059
Hard drives?

3127
04:16:48,700 --> 04:16:52,670
I can't really move around these.

3128
04:16:53,549 --> 04:16:57,790
All right, I gotta get out of here.

3129
04:16:57,790 --> 04:16:58,270
It's time to go.

3130
04:16:58,989 --> 04:17:00,239
Time to leave.

3131
04:17:01,200 --> 04:17:01,840
Where's the painting?

3132
04:17:06,459 --> 04:17:07,899
Okay, go, out.

3133
04:17:07,899 --> 04:17:09,100
They're gonna be home in like two seconds.

3134
04:17:09,819 --> 04:17:13,579
Use the front door.

3135
04:17:14,299 --> 04:17:23,629
I stole that kid's money.

3136
04:17:24,989 --> 04:17:26,190
He didn't need it.

3137
04:17:26,829 --> 04:17:37,219
Is that person gonna see this?

3138
04:17:37,780 --> 04:18:00,020
Just drive to the edge.

3139
04:18:00,579 --> 04:18:13,069
How could he know that anything was up?

3140
04:18:15,040 --> 04:18:21,420
All right, time to level up.

3141
04:18:21,420 --> 04:18:23,340
I need appraisal two.

3142
04:18:23,340 --> 04:18:25,940
Disassemble jewelry with special tools.

3143
04:18:25,940 --> 04:18:26,340
Got it.

3144
04:18:26,979 --> 04:18:27,780
Mini.

3145
04:18:27,780 --> 04:18:31,299
Greenview 107 don't like our protection plan.

3146
04:18:32,100 --> 04:18:35,139
I hope nothing happens to the jewelry in their bedroom.

3147
04:18:35,780 --> 04:18:38,260
Do I just have to keep stealing money from the same people?

3148
04:18:42,739 --> 04:18:43,459
I feel bad.

3149
04:18:47,309 --> 04:18:48,829
Well, here's jewelry tools.

3150
04:18:49,950 --> 04:18:52,610
I'm probably going to need them, right?

3151
04:18:55,250 --> 04:18:56,049
Whatever.

3152
04:18:56,049 --> 04:19:01,090
Well, here's a radio.

3153
04:19:06,379 --> 04:19:07,340
Rent a thug.

3154
04:19:07,340 --> 04:19:08,620
Steal a painting.

3155
04:19:08,620 --> 04:19:09,819
China from 108.

3156
04:19:10,459 --> 04:19:15,180
Okay, sell the other stuff.

3157
04:19:15,899 --> 04:19:18,739
They keep letting you get away with it.

3158
04:19:20,370 --> 04:19:21,329
Yeah, they really do.

3159
04:19:23,260 --> 04:19:23,899
This is different.

3160
04:19:24,540 --> 04:19:26,139
Jewelry workshop.

3161
04:19:26,860 --> 04:19:27,579
No items.

3162
04:19:28,139 --> 04:19:35,700
What do you do if your house keeps getting robbed?

3163
04:19:36,979 --> 04:19:41,219
You gotta make like an elaborate home alone trap.

3164
04:19:49,059 --> 04:19:49,860
Welcome back.

3165
04:19:51,500 --> 04:19:53,739
The jewelry tools allow you to assemble jewelry before...

3166
04:19:53,739 --> 04:19:54,540
Of course.

3167
04:19:54,540 --> 04:19:55,420
Right, what else we got?

3168
04:19:55,420 --> 04:19:56,139
We got the pear.

3169
04:19:57,700 --> 04:19:58,899
Got the guitar.

3170
04:20:00,020 --> 04:20:00,979
Headphones.

3171
04:20:00,979 --> 04:20:01,780
And the painting.

3172
04:20:07,059 --> 04:20:09,700
Yeah, at that point I would just put the Mona Lisa in the window

3173
04:20:09,700 --> 04:20:13,780
and then put like fucking tacks all over the ground right before it.

3174
04:20:14,739 --> 04:20:15,940
Or like a trap.

3175
04:20:16,979 --> 04:20:19,379
Just build a gigantic trap door underneath.

3176
04:20:20,020 --> 04:20:22,319
And then pull the lever when the guy gets in.

3177
04:20:30,139 --> 04:20:30,780
Nice painting.

3178
04:20:30,780 --> 04:20:31,739
Yeah, it was 10 bucks.

3179
04:20:32,459 --> 04:20:34,219
All right, steal jewelry from 107.

3180
04:20:36,020 --> 04:20:37,459
When do I get to go to another place?

3181
04:20:52,180 --> 04:20:53,299
107.

3182
04:20:54,020 --> 04:21:01,260
Well, it's conveniently located right here.

3183
04:21:04,610 --> 04:21:05,889
I went down the stairs.

3184
04:21:08,270 --> 04:21:09,309
Straight down the stairs.

3185
04:21:09,870 --> 04:21:13,729
It was very interesting.

3186
04:21:13,729 --> 04:21:14,209
Here we go.

3187
04:21:14,930 --> 04:21:15,649
I didn't do that.

3188
04:21:16,290 --> 04:21:18,879
All right, jewelry in the bedroom.

3189
04:21:33,100 --> 04:21:33,899
There.

3190
04:21:33,899 --> 04:21:36,340
Okay, let's case it up.

3191
04:21:36,340 --> 04:21:38,430
Because I don't know anything about 107.

3192
04:21:39,649 --> 04:21:40,530
Absolute zero.

3193
04:21:41,090 --> 04:21:44,290
But what I do know is that radio is not worth anything.

3194
04:21:44,930 --> 04:21:49,299
The wine, on the other hand, is worth 20 bucks.

3195
04:21:51,170 --> 04:21:55,010
The wine is actually worth five dollars less than the radio.

3196
04:21:55,010 --> 04:21:58,079
So I'm not sure why I did that.

3197
04:22:00,350 --> 04:22:01,309
Steal the gnome.

3198
04:22:01,950 --> 04:22:12,930
Is there a gnome in this yard?

3199
04:22:13,489 --> 04:22:16,620
All right, well, I can open this but I don't...

3200
04:22:16,620 --> 04:22:17,739
Somebody might be right behind it.

3201
04:22:18,459 --> 04:22:30,719
All right, got to be really careful.

3202
04:22:31,520 --> 04:22:32,879
Steal the jewelry in the bedroom.

3203
04:22:36,989 --> 04:22:37,950
Can I hear sound effects?

3204
04:22:38,670 --> 04:22:49,219
Come on.

3205
04:22:49,299 --> 04:22:53,659
Are they in the...

3206
04:22:54,379 --> 04:22:56,420
They're right here.

3207
04:22:57,540 --> 04:22:58,260
Oh, shit.

3208
04:22:58,260 --> 04:22:59,620
Is there more than one person in here now?

3209
04:23:00,180 --> 04:23:03,790
They're turning on the lights.

3210
04:23:04,430 --> 04:23:07,549
I wish I knew where they were.

3211
04:23:08,350 --> 04:23:13,059
Dude, they're just going back and forth turning the lights on and off.

3212
04:23:13,059 --> 04:23:14,579
Like, go somewhere.

3213
04:23:14,579 --> 04:23:15,139
What are you doing?

3214
04:23:15,940 --> 04:23:26,100
They're outside.

3215
04:23:26,739 --> 04:23:49,379
Okay, jewelry.

3216
04:23:49,379 --> 04:23:50,180
Where's the jewelry?

3217
04:23:50,180 --> 04:23:58,770
Is she coming upstairs?

3218
04:23:58,770 --> 04:24:09,889
Get in the fucking thing!

3219
04:24:17,549 --> 04:24:18,590
No, that's towards the cops.

3220
04:24:18,590 --> 04:24:19,309
This way.

3221
04:24:19,309 --> 04:24:22,479
Oh, I'm in trouble.

3222
04:24:22,479 --> 04:24:23,200
I got to get up now.

3223
04:24:23,200 --> 04:24:28,370
Come on, come on, come on, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

3224
04:24:28,370 --> 04:24:29,329
Just run straight for the exit.

3225
04:24:29,329 --> 04:24:30,129
You can make it.

3226
04:24:31,540 --> 04:24:33,219
He's closing the gap, but I'm fine.

3227
04:24:33,219 --> 04:24:34,819
I'm good.

3228
04:24:37,090 --> 04:24:39,889
I was trying to hide in the closet, but I couldn't fit in it.

3229
04:24:39,889 --> 04:24:55,440
Please remember to break down the jewelry.

3230
04:24:55,440 --> 04:24:57,120
There's a tool for it in the shop.

3231
04:25:02,370 --> 04:25:02,930
Break it down.

3232
04:25:02,930 --> 04:25:03,409
Select it.

3233
04:25:05,379 --> 04:25:06,420
How do you do this?

3234
04:25:06,420 --> 04:25:08,020
Break down the jewelry.

3235
04:25:08,020 --> 04:25:29,180
Okay.

3236
04:25:34,030 --> 04:25:35,149
You broke it.

3237
04:25:35,149 --> 04:25:36,670
I was supposed to break it.

3238
04:25:36,670 --> 04:25:42,610
You're supposed to pull out all the jewels.

3239
04:25:42,610 --> 04:25:48,219
That's it, right?

3240
04:25:54,370 --> 04:25:55,489
Infinity necklace.

3241
04:26:02,379 --> 04:26:05,010
Yeah, it does look like it, doesn't it?

3242
04:26:05,569 --> 04:26:07,680
What am I detaching?

3243
04:26:08,319 --> 04:26:16,379
It's better be worth a thousand dollars.

3244
04:26:16,379 --> 04:26:22,770
You know, that's just kind of there.

3245
04:26:23,409 --> 04:26:42,020
The best I can do is 25 dollars.

3246
04:26:43,649 --> 04:26:44,450
Take it or leave it.

3247
04:26:45,170 --> 04:26:56,319
The best I can do is 25 dollars.

3248
04:26:56,319 --> 04:26:57,120
That was a good one.

3249
04:26:57,760 --> 04:26:58,799
That was a very good one.

3250
04:26:58,799 --> 04:27:01,680
A professional knows how to handle a real safe.

3251
04:27:02,319 --> 04:27:04,559
Are you lockpicking skills up to the job?

3252
04:27:05,920 --> 04:27:06,319
I don't know.

3253
04:27:06,319 --> 04:27:09,360
Do I have to go break into 106 for a 15th time?

3254
04:27:10,239 --> 04:27:13,709
And cause them all kinds of problems and anguish?

3255
04:27:14,430 --> 04:27:18,340
Do I have anything in here?

3256
04:27:18,420 --> 04:27:18,739
No.

3257
04:27:18,739 --> 04:27:19,700
I have the jewelry though.

3258
04:27:19,700 --> 04:27:20,260
What's it worth?

3259
04:27:20,899 --> 04:27:26,180
Bracelet parts.

3260
04:27:27,469 --> 04:27:28,670
Well, we're gonna go find out.

3261
04:27:29,389 --> 04:27:31,389
Unless, can I sell them on the black market or something?

3262
04:27:37,870 --> 04:27:38,590
Electronics?

3263
04:27:38,590 --> 04:27:38,989
Nope.

3264
04:27:38,989 --> 04:27:39,549
Kitchen?

3265
04:27:39,549 --> 04:27:39,870
Other?

3266
04:27:40,909 --> 04:27:41,549
Antiques?

3267
04:27:42,350 --> 04:27:42,909
Art?

3268
04:27:42,909 --> 04:27:43,149
No.

3269
04:27:43,870 --> 04:27:45,969
Looks like it's getting pawned.

3270
04:27:50,180 --> 04:27:52,340
Steal 15 dollars from 106 again.

3271
04:28:01,600 --> 04:28:02,479
I got some stuff for you.

3272
04:28:02,479 --> 04:28:03,200
Welcome back.

3273
04:28:04,350 --> 04:28:05,950
Well, that's 800 bucks.

3274
04:28:06,829 --> 04:28:08,430
That's a lot more than I thought it was gonna be.

3275
04:28:19,360 --> 04:28:21,440
So, I mean, now...

3276
04:28:23,500 --> 04:28:25,020
107, 108.

3277
04:28:25,979 --> 04:28:28,540
Steal the painting called China.

3278
04:28:28,540 --> 04:28:31,940
I'm gonna have to do it during this point.

3279
04:28:32,500 --> 04:28:34,770
Let's go do it.

3280
04:28:38,909 --> 04:28:39,950
Drop off the hard drive?

3281
04:28:40,750 --> 04:28:53,360
Where do I do that?

3282
04:28:53,360 --> 04:28:53,760
Right here.

3283
04:28:55,340 --> 04:28:55,899
All right, let's...

3284
04:28:56,780 --> 04:29:00,209
I'm not gonna break it.

3285
04:29:00,850 --> 04:29:03,649
All right, we got jewelry tools.

3286
04:29:03,649 --> 04:29:05,010
I don't need that until I'm here.

3287
04:29:07,409 --> 04:29:09,409
Front door key for 109.

3288
04:29:09,409 --> 04:29:10,209
Don't need that.

3289
04:29:10,209 --> 04:29:11,889
Front door key for 113.

3290
04:29:12,610 --> 04:29:13,489
Put that away.

3291
04:29:15,840 --> 04:29:16,319
All right.

3292
04:29:16,479 --> 04:29:20,350
That's a bunch of people.

3293
04:29:20,350 --> 04:29:21,229
I'm like a janitor.

3294
04:29:21,229 --> 04:29:22,190
I have everybody's keys.

3295
04:29:25,940 --> 04:29:26,420
Whatever.

3296
04:29:46,989 --> 04:29:47,950
Okay, let's go.

3297
04:29:48,829 --> 04:29:50,930
Steal China from...

3298
04:29:51,569 --> 04:29:52,739
Where was it?

3299
04:29:52,739 --> 04:29:55,809
101, 108.

3300
04:29:56,899 --> 04:29:58,420
Steal China from 108.

3301
04:29:59,299 --> 04:30:02,030
I will do my best.

3302
04:30:02,750 --> 04:30:10,450
Is he gonna do it again?

3303
04:30:11,329 --> 04:30:13,329
I think he's gonna do it again.

3304
04:30:15,010 --> 04:30:16,129
He's gonna try to do it.

3305
04:30:16,129 --> 04:30:17,170
Let's see if he can do it.

3306
04:30:28,350 --> 04:30:29,149
Well, I got it.

3307
04:30:35,389 --> 04:30:36,110
I can't leave.

3308
04:30:37,069 --> 04:30:37,870
Uh-oh.

3309
04:30:37,870 --> 04:30:47,090
All right, we're good.

3310
04:30:47,090 --> 04:30:48,209
No, no, we're not.

3311
04:30:48,209 --> 04:30:48,690
Not at all.

3312
04:30:49,250 --> 04:30:59,139
Oh, forward I dance!

3313
04:30:59,139 --> 04:31:09,469
All right, I think I'm stuck here.

3314
04:31:09,469 --> 04:31:22,909
Put him behind bars.

3315
04:31:22,909 --> 04:31:35,340
Hey, come here for a second

3316
04:31:35,340 --> 04:31:40,930
so I can restart the checkpoint by hitting you.

3317
04:31:40,930 --> 04:31:41,489
Be nice.

3318
04:31:41,489 --> 04:32:02,780
I should be able to get in the car.

3319
04:32:02,780 --> 04:32:04,299
You're a caged animal.

3320
04:32:04,299 --> 04:32:13,620
I don't have any V-Bucks.

3321
04:32:13,620 --> 04:32:17,709
How much is one V-Dollar worth in...

3322
04:32:17,709 --> 04:33:20,770
I have to hold sprint down so I don't hit.

3323
04:33:20,770 --> 04:33:21,490
Just reverse.

3324
04:33:21,490 --> 04:33:21,970
I can't.

3325
04:33:22,610 --> 04:33:25,009
I tried to get the wheels in the inside of the...

3326
04:33:25,569 --> 04:33:26,209
Where the stairs are.

3327
04:33:26,209 --> 04:33:26,770
I couldn't do it.

3328
04:33:27,409 --> 04:33:38,189
Come on.

3329
04:33:43,819 --> 04:33:44,380
Oh, no.

3330
04:33:46,349 --> 04:33:52,000
I think I may have ruined the whole game.

3331
04:33:52,000 --> 04:33:53,040
I think I saw...

3332
04:33:53,040 --> 04:33:56,479
Why would auto save right there?

3333
04:33:56,479 --> 04:34:06,080
Is that the end?

3334
04:34:06,639 --> 04:34:08,080
Is this where I have to end this game?

3335
04:34:08,639 --> 04:34:10,610
What if I just don't move?

3336
04:34:10,610 --> 04:34:17,549
Oh, I think I can do it.

3337
04:34:17,549 --> 04:34:18,990
I just need to get the reverse right.

3338
04:34:25,229 --> 04:34:26,430
Okay, if I can just...

3339
04:34:28,799 --> 04:34:30,639
When I press S, it goes forward.

3340
04:34:34,020 --> 04:34:35,619
I'm trying to reverse right now.

3341
04:34:35,619 --> 04:34:41,540
Come on, right here.

3342
04:34:41,540 --> 04:34:42,340
Can I get it right here?

3343
04:34:42,979 --> 04:34:47,099
Ooh, almost had it.

3344
04:34:47,659 --> 04:34:48,909
Almost got it.

3345
04:34:49,470 --> 04:35:01,090
Come on!

3346
04:35:01,569 --> 04:35:09,389
I think I can go over this if I really try hard enough here.

3347
04:35:12,700 --> 04:35:13,180
I think so.

3348
04:35:18,540 --> 04:35:20,060
Ask the guy across the street.

3349
04:35:20,060 --> 04:35:21,099
I soft-locked the whole game.

3350
04:35:21,099 --> 04:35:21,900
It's over.

3351
04:35:21,900 --> 04:35:26,450
Was it worth it, Jeremy?

3352
04:35:42,610 --> 04:35:43,250
I can't just...

3353
04:35:43,250 --> 04:35:44,049
Can I just back up?

3354
04:35:44,049 --> 04:35:45,490
I can't back up any more than this.

3355
04:35:47,729 --> 04:35:48,049
Save it!

3356
04:35:48,049 --> 04:35:49,259
Come on, get up!

3357
04:35:49,259 --> 04:35:50,060
Go, go, go, go!

3358
04:35:50,060 --> 04:35:51,259
Up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up!

3359
04:35:51,259 --> 04:35:51,659
I did it.

3360
04:35:51,659 --> 04:35:52,700
Okay, I made it.

3361
04:35:52,700 --> 04:36:25,419
I did it!

3362
04:36:25,419 --> 04:36:26,779
Not soft-locked anymore.

3363
04:36:26,779 --> 04:36:33,810
Wait, what's the plan here?

3364
04:36:38,779 --> 04:36:39,740
Somebody just wrote,

3365
04:36:39,740 --> 04:36:40,779
fucking loser.

3366
04:36:41,939 --> 04:36:42,340
I...

3367
04:36:42,340 --> 04:36:43,860
Hey, come on, man.

3368
04:36:43,860 --> 04:36:49,740
Don't be so mean to me.

3369
04:36:49,740 --> 04:36:50,619
Fucking loser.

3370
04:36:54,000 --> 04:36:54,880
All right, 108.

3371
04:36:55,520 --> 04:36:56,720
Steal the china.

3372
04:36:57,599 --> 04:36:58,959
Steal the china.

3373
04:36:58,959 --> 04:37:00,259
Steal the china.

3374
04:37:00,259 --> 04:37:01,279
Steal the china.

3375
04:37:01,279 --> 04:37:02,560
If I say it enough times I'll get it.

3376
04:37:03,939 --> 04:37:05,380
Steal the china.

3377
04:37:05,380 --> 04:37:06,500
Steal the china.

3378
04:37:08,110 --> 04:37:09,490
Say it again.

3379
04:37:09,490 --> 04:37:10,689
Steal the china.

3380
04:37:22,880 --> 04:37:24,080
Steal the china.

3381
04:37:24,080 --> 04:37:26,880
Steal the china.

3382
04:37:38,110 --> 04:37:38,189
No.

3383
04:37:38,189 --> 04:37:39,310
Why am I trying to get in the car?

3384
04:37:39,310 --> 04:37:40,029
No, just run.

3385
04:37:40,029 --> 04:37:56,299
I did it! I did it in one shot! What? I didn't get the china!

3386
04:37:57,340 --> 04:38:05,020
Steal the china! Steal the china! Steal the china! Not the daisy! Not the daisy!

3387
04:38:06,740 --> 04:38:17,150
The china! Oh my god! That was not the right painting, but it was lit up! Where is it?

3388
04:38:17,630 --> 04:38:46,099
There's people! No! No! Steal the china! Steal the china! Steal the china! Steal the china!

3389
04:38:51,119 --> 04:39:18,529
No, that's not it! We're gonna go back to the... Ow, my stomach! We're going back to the car.

3390
04:39:22,750 --> 04:39:30,939
Yeah, officers! The fuck! Officer, this guy ran into my house. He just kept screaming,

3391
04:39:30,939 --> 04:39:44,049
Steal the china! Steal the china! Oh god damn it! The guy sprints in your house,

3392
04:39:44,770 --> 04:39:50,799
just repeating the same like robotic sentence. You have a painting upstairs,

3393
04:39:50,799 --> 04:39:55,279
you're like, I have a painting called the china? Oh, I do! That's right!

3394
04:40:00,639 --> 04:40:13,220
Oh, no! Get in the car! How did I do this last time?

3395
04:40:13,459 --> 04:40:24,819
Steal the china. Just saying it so deliberately. You have to remind yourself, it's a fucking grocery

3396
04:40:24,819 --> 04:40:34,430
list. Pick up eggs. Pick up the eggs. Wife will be very angry with me. Pick up the eggs. I can't

3397
04:40:34,430 --> 04:41:16,750
believe I'm back here again. I can't fucking steal the china. I said it over and over and

3398
04:41:16,750 --> 04:41:23,009
over again, and I picked up the wrong one, and now we're back here. It's like we never

3399
04:41:26,380 --> 04:41:43,540
left here. How am I here again? Because I stole the wrong painting, and

3400
04:41:49,099 --> 04:41:59,229
should have just left the map. I know. What is this? Why are you looking? Say it again.

3401
04:41:59,869 --> 04:42:20,130
Steal the china. Uh oh. Steal the china. It's not me talking. Steal the china. My frame!

3402
04:42:21,889 --> 04:42:31,599
Oh, no! My computer's gonna crack! I'm gonna blue screen! I'm going! No! Why?

3403
04:42:33,020 --> 04:42:46,319
Get me out! I'm like it's a memory leak. I'm in a memory leak. I can't escape. I didn't get

3404
04:42:46,319 --> 04:42:55,889
the china. Steal the china. Steal the china. Steal the china. Not the... Say it again. Steal

3405
04:42:55,889 --> 04:43:14,540
the china. Steal the china. Steal the china. Steal the china. Steal the china.

3406
04:43:15,500 --> 04:43:20,060
I'm like trying to bring somebody back to life. I'm like sitting around a circle with like

3407
04:43:20,060 --> 04:43:35,299
candles around me. Trying to bring like Elvis back. I can't alt tab. 93%. Look at how slow...

3408
04:43:35,299 --> 04:43:48,450
I gotta pull this out of here before my computer breaks. Alt F4. I have to. Maybe it'll help.

3409
04:43:52,540 --> 04:44:16,369
My computer is hard locking. Am I still alive? Yep. Okay, I'm good. I just...

3410
04:44:17,330 --> 04:44:27,790
I have to steal the china. I have to steal the china. I can... I'll never let this down.

3411
04:44:27,790 --> 04:44:31,150
I have to get this. I have to go steal it. I have to go get this dumb fucking painting.

3412
04:44:31,869 --> 04:45:08,419
Can we get... Can we get china in the next German rumble? No. I don't... What? How would

3413
04:45:08,419 --> 04:45:16,779
that work? Like the whole... Like all... Like all the whole... The whole china? The whole thing?

3414
04:45:30,819 --> 04:46:07,869
Sprint. Sprint. Okay, I'm almost there. How do I save the game? Did it. Okay, it's time.

3415
04:46:08,430 --> 04:46:18,900
It's time. Give me... Let's give me one second. Just give me one minute here.

3416
04:46:18,900 --> 04:46:25,409
I'm going to just use the bathroom. I'll be right back. Get yourself a little snack.

3417
04:46:25,409 --> 04:49:05,069
I'll see you in two seconds. Steal the china. Steal the china. Steal the china. Steal the china.

3418
04:49:05,150 --> 04:49:06,590
Oh shit, I fucked it up.

3419
04:49:10,580 --> 04:49:11,220
God damn it.

3420
04:49:21,060 --> 04:49:27,229
I was gonna have this blast while I was doing it with like scary music. Oh well. Well, that's

3421
04:49:27,229 --> 04:49:48,619
ruined. But I didn't go anywhere, by the way. I've been here the whole time. You can still do

3422
04:49:48,619 --> 04:50:00,540
it. I won't tell anyone. I was gonna... I need like more time. I was gonna start screaming on

3423
04:50:00,540 --> 04:50:10,770
it and stuff. All right. Where... I don't even know where we're going. 107, right?

3424
04:50:30,750 --> 04:50:34,110
I'm just kidding. I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

3425
04:50:42,799 --> 04:50:54,669
You gotta be fucking kidding me. Don't you dare joke around with us.

3426
04:50:58,580 --> 04:51:05,060
Just hurry up and steal the china, okay? That's all that matters. Do as fast as you possibly can.

3427
04:51:25,439 --> 04:51:56,080
Okay, where is it? I don't even care. It's up there. Steal. That was the right one.

3428
04:51:56,080 --> 04:52:00,479
That was the right painting. Do you understand? That... This is the... This is the china.

3429
04:52:00,479 --> 04:52:05,360
That's the china. That's it. That's the china. I was right the first time. I had china.

3430
04:52:05,360 --> 04:52:11,279
I picked up china. That was china. I stole it. I stole china.

3431
04:52:23,790 --> 04:52:26,029
That was what it was pointing at. I had it the whole time.

3432
04:52:28,479 --> 04:52:38,240
That's daisy. But why is it... What happened? It was clearly... That was where it was.

3433
04:52:38,240 --> 04:53:20,369
Where'd it go? All right. So it explains to me, right? The marker was upstairs

3434
04:53:20,369 --> 04:53:24,849
around that corner. The daisy is the thing that's highlighted. The thing behind it is

3435
04:53:24,849 --> 04:53:37,419
the flower. Where's the china? Where is the china? Bottom floor? Why is it pointing me upstairs?

3436
04:53:38,139 --> 04:53:47,409
Like, this is... This is... This is not down here. It's very clearly like,

3437
04:53:47,409 --> 04:54:19,439
go up there and steal china. There it is. That's it. Is that it? Is it? Is there it is?

3438
04:54:20,159 --> 04:55:03,970
The china. How do you get out of your fucked up house? Get out of here. I need the light. Oh!

3439
04:55:03,970 --> 04:55:29,619
Get in there. The garage door? I... There's no garage door opener here. Yes, there is.

3440
04:55:29,619 --> 04:56:46,900
He got it. He caught the china. Yeah! Yes! D plus. Level up. Block picking four.

3441
04:56:46,900 --> 04:57:03,729
Block picking four. Open safe. Use glass knife. I only need two skill points. What? Who else?

3442
04:57:03,729 --> 04:57:12,060
What can I do now? All right. Where's the china on here? Candle holder, candle holder,

3443
04:57:12,060 --> 04:57:37,840
triple vase, flower vase, glass cup, the china. Where is it? I mean, I have it.

3444
04:57:37,840 --> 04:58:09,099
Do I need to steal it? I've got the china right here. This is correct, right? Welcome back.

3445
04:58:10,220 --> 04:58:57,939
Here. Four hundred bucks. Thank you. I had it right the whole time. Everybody was screaming at

3446
04:58:57,939 --> 04:59:18,669
me. I was being screamed at. That it was the daisy. No, no. It was a joke and I'm glad it...

3447
04:59:18,669 --> 04:59:27,409
Say we're fine. That's pretty... It's perfectly fine. Steal the china. Steal the china. Steal

3448
04:59:27,409 --> 05:01:06,979
the china. Steal the china. Get it. Okay. Got it. Stole the daisy. No, it was the china.

3449
05:01:06,979 --> 05:01:24,669
That was the china. I knew I wasn't crazy. I knew that I wasn't crazy, you know? New hints.

3450
05:01:26,450 --> 05:01:28,930
Uh, I can't do the skills. I want to... I need to wait till the next level.

3451
05:01:30,500 --> 05:01:40,580
I got new notes. Jobs, jobs, jobs, jobs, jobs, jobs, jobs, jobs, jobs,

3452
05:01:41,540 --> 05:01:47,569
jobs, jobs. I don't have any jobs. There's no jobs. I don't have any jobs.

3453
05:02:03,919 --> 05:02:13,340
Where are the jobs? Spencer just came in and gave five community subs here. Spencer Twitch

3454
05:02:13,340 --> 05:02:20,139
chat. Did I say Twitch chat? Twitch chat? I have no idea what the fuck's wrong with me,

3455
05:02:20,139 --> 05:02:27,900
but thank you, Spencer. And thanks for... See, there aren't... Look it. This is a bunch of

3456
05:02:27,900 --> 05:02:38,779
neighborhoods you can go to. But thanks a lot, man. I got nothing else to do. Do I just have

3457
05:02:38,779 --> 05:02:47,060
to go break into people's houses and steal stuff? Just get to level four? Man, I guess.

3458
05:02:57,700 --> 05:03:00,819
Steal for the pleasure of it. Well, I need... Okay, now I'm going to go to one of the

3459
05:03:00,819 --> 05:03:07,939
bigger houses now. Steal the china to farm XP. I'm not going to steal china to farm XP.

3460
05:03:09,580 --> 05:03:19,020
That would be a bad, bad idea. Because China does not have very much profit. It's only worth

3461
05:03:19,020 --> 05:03:28,450
like $15 or something. Or what was it? $40? I'd be better off stealing money from people's

3462
05:03:28,450 --> 05:03:37,470
houses. Like these people. It was $400. Well, is it? Should I just go do that again?

3463
05:03:37,470 --> 05:03:47,979
Okay, it was $400. Why did I think it was like $40? Maybe it's because of all the other little

3464
05:03:47,979 --> 05:04:25,889
ones. I'm sorry, guys. This is another slide. Nice. I'm gonna do it again. This is costing

3465
05:04:25,889 --> 05:04:42,860
me too much money. Last one, I promise. Last one. I want to like feel the thing go down.

3466
05:04:43,580 --> 05:04:46,610
You know, I want to I want to feel it like underneath my carriage here.

3467
05:04:48,909 --> 05:05:08,049
In first person. It's better to ride a roller coaster like this. Oh god, we're at the top

3468
05:05:08,049 --> 05:05:36,669
of Splash Mountain. Come on, back into this. Am I gonna get the car towed?

3469
05:05:38,430 --> 05:05:42,590
The car is gonna get towed with me in it. How does that work?

3470
05:05:43,229 --> 05:05:46,880
Hold on, I need to know how this works. He's calling the cops right now.

3471
05:05:47,439 --> 05:06:03,409
The police will tow your car. Okay, let's wait for the tow truck. He's waiting his turn on

3472
05:06:03,409 --> 05:06:07,650
the slide. Yeah. Well, I was too fat. I was a big fat guy and got stuck on it.

3473
05:06:08,369 --> 05:06:14,799
Yeah, I can't open the door. I'm kind of stuck on this right now. But here it comes. Yeah,

3474
05:06:14,799 --> 05:06:27,250
here comes the police to help me. Here it comes. How the hell are you gonna figure

3475
05:06:27,250 --> 05:06:33,740
out how to get here? He's gonna have a lot of trouble trying to get over here.

3476
05:06:41,939 --> 05:06:49,169
No, he's gonna he's gonna come back because he's gonna come over here and he's gonna

3477
05:06:49,169 --> 05:06:58,590
he's gonna screw the whole thing up. Well, I'm blocking both sides. So you can't walk up

3478
05:06:58,590 --> 05:07:04,029
here and oh, if I could only just go down right now. If I could only just drive straight down.

3479
05:07:12,880 --> 05:07:18,020
All the NPCs are coming over here. I don't know why they're so drawn to this place.

3480
05:07:18,020 --> 05:07:23,389
I'm like a NPC magnet. What are you doing? No, why is it? It really is a line for the slide.

3481
05:07:25,090 --> 05:07:50,770
He can't figure it out. He has no idea where to go. Can I how do you beep? Q? No.

3482
05:07:51,490 --> 05:08:05,549
Q opens up this wheel. There was another person. The police will tow your car. The

3483
05:08:05,549 --> 05:08:22,849
cop is gone. All great thieves honk their horn. I kind of want to see if every NPC in the whole

3484
05:08:22,849 --> 05:08:29,020
town comes over here. Look at this. Did you bind M3 to eat yet? I don't know what the hell

3485
05:08:29,020 --> 05:08:41,119
I was talking about. What was I even talking about? Just come over here. Please, police officer,

3486
05:08:41,119 --> 05:08:49,299
just drive over here. I'm very clearly causing a problem. Just drive down here.

3487
05:08:50,509 --> 05:09:02,459
You know where I am. Turn in here. Come on. Turn in here. Turn in here. Turn! Turn! Oh,

3488
05:09:02,459 --> 05:09:10,830
he's gonna drive by us every time. The star is just fading. Come on, there's gotta be something

3489
05:09:10,830 --> 05:09:20,849
I can do about this here. I can't go forward. I can't go backwards. I can't. Nobody can do

3490
05:09:20,849 --> 05:09:35,090
anything. I'm just gonna try to hold it. What about this way? There's another person.

3491
05:09:40,209 --> 05:09:50,220
Damn it. I can't at least climb out of the side. Well, hold on. Last chance. Come on. Turn

3492
05:09:50,220 --> 05:09:56,979
down here. You can see me. I'm right here. I'm waving. I'll wave to you. No, he can't

3493
05:09:56,979 --> 05:10:07,409
do it. He's not gonna do it. He'll never figure it out. I wonder if I can do like a

3494
05:10:07,409 --> 05:10:28,909
series of... Oh, well. We tried. Stop stalling. What do you want me to do? I'm trying to go.

3495
05:10:32,159 --> 05:10:39,680
Making noise? Hold on. I'm gonna get the actual police over here. I was just making

3496
05:10:39,680 --> 05:10:47,759
noise apparently. Making noise. Because if they get the actual police over here,

3497
05:10:47,759 --> 05:10:58,819
this could get interesting. I need to... Come on. Just get the cops over here. Like

3498
05:10:58,819 --> 05:11:08,450
the actual... Like two stars. This could get interesting. I'm gonna give this like 10 more

3499
05:11:08,450 --> 05:11:23,330
seconds and then I'll stop. I wish there was a horn. I'm pressing every button to try to beep.

3500
05:11:23,889 --> 05:11:38,540
I just don't think it exists. Alt shift. I can't hit the brakes. Oh, well. That's too bad.

3501
05:11:39,810 --> 05:11:51,840
Too bad. Nah, I can't get up. I was trying to do the... Look at how funny this is to go

3502
05:11:51,840 --> 05:12:11,250
down the slide. All right. What do I go? Just... I was gonna steal stuff. Do it again.

3503
05:12:15,979 --> 05:12:31,939
I didn't sell my paintings, you're right. Your bag is full. Welcome back. Sell them all.

3504
05:12:34,000 --> 05:12:43,819
All right. Let's go. Sell the china. Sell the china. Sell the china. Sell the china.

3505
05:12:44,540 --> 05:13:00,720
I'm gonna be hearing that in my sleep tonight. Buy the china back?

3506
05:13:01,680 --> 05:13:07,889
Why would I want to buy the china back? I got $400 for it. All right. Let's make this easy.

3507
05:13:07,889 --> 05:13:25,389
I'm gonna go to... I want to go to the bigger houses over here. I didn't... Oh, I stuck again.

3508
05:13:25,389 --> 05:13:35,869
I was just trying to go the other way. I can't move. I'm stuck again. At least I can get out

3509
05:13:35,869 --> 05:13:50,209
of that goddamn car. How would I get stuck there? That's impossible. All right. I'm just

3510
05:13:50,209 --> 05:13:54,209
gonna steal from... I have the thing to open the doors here. I'm gonna get a bunch of money

3511
05:13:55,250 --> 05:14:05,540
from 113 because I know that they're both not home. Well, they're both not be home,

3512
05:14:05,540 --> 05:14:18,319
which is Barbara now. And we steal literally all their stuff. Does this explode?

3513
05:14:29,009 --> 05:14:36,319
Okay. They're both gone at this point. Yes, they are. Okay. Just give me your stuff. I'm

3514
05:14:36,319 --> 05:14:51,680
looking for expensive stuff. These are two bucks a pop. Too heavy. Get the double alarm

3515
05:14:51,680 --> 05:15:05,540
clock. I don't want it. I don't want the dumb alarm clock. I'll take cash. Cash is easy.

3516
05:15:05,540 --> 05:15:16,209
50 bucks. There it is. Clown ball. Don't want it. Okay. Expensive guitar. $70 days.

3517
05:15:16,849 --> 05:15:27,459
Nothing there. I don't want the alarm clock. Check for more money. No, these things are

3518
05:15:27,459 --> 05:15:37,330
both $12. Don't want them. I can't pick up the clown ball. So why would I be able to steal it?

3519
05:15:37,330 --> 05:16:04,380
Look, I can't take the clown ball. Oops. I leave another 50 bucks. $5. Worthless. Ooh,

3520
05:16:05,099 --> 05:16:11,900
$50 phone. Pretty nice. I don't these cabinets open. $90 for a microwave,

3521
05:16:11,900 --> 05:16:19,970
but I can't carry it. It's too heavy. Tea box. Couple of wines. I think I'm out of room.

3522
05:16:19,970 --> 05:16:34,509
Let's like find some. Wait, how much is this worth? $40? Worthless. $18? Even more worthless.

3523
05:16:35,069 --> 05:16:40,689
This receiver is, I can't even pick it up. Who's looking? Does somebody see me?

3524
05:16:40,689 --> 05:17:04,540
This thing's $40. Just take it. Let's go the way we came. Baptism. No, this one's more

3525
05:17:04,540 --> 05:17:27,810
expensive. Okay, I can go with the front door. All right. Let's just, can I just run with the

3526
05:17:27,810 --> 05:17:45,599
painting in my hands? Just to the end? Will I still have it? Walk it right to the pawn shop.

3527
05:17:45,599 --> 05:17:57,299
Let's see if this works. It says a nice, no, I don't have it. Trunk? No. Oh well. All right.

3528
05:17:57,299 --> 05:18:07,169
Welcome back. So, guitar, lemon, razor, tea box, wine, wine. All right. I can do

3529
05:18:07,810 --> 05:18:19,869
lockpicking four now, right? No, not yet. Damn. Carry big items faster. More backpack

3530
05:18:19,869 --> 05:18:27,150
space. Disamble jewelry. Remove security from decks. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Climb on the house

3531
05:18:27,150 --> 05:18:47,549
gutters. Well, I'll give it a shot. Everything gives the same XP, so just steal a ton of small

3532
05:18:47,549 --> 05:19:03,779
stuff. Thanks for the tip. That's a good idea. All right. 101 is a big house. It's time to go

3533
05:19:03,779 --> 05:19:23,819
for the big shit. 101 is gigantic. Plenty of points of entry. What's with the indicator here?

3534
05:19:27,659 --> 05:19:34,419
Camera in front? Okay. Camera in front. Power switch will turn off the cameras.

3535
05:19:35,520 --> 05:19:52,400
Well, here's the electrical. Open it up. The electricity will be fixed in 237. Does the

3536
05:19:52,400 --> 05:20:11,810
guy actually come fix it? What's that way? Now, there's people walking around out here.

3537
05:20:12,529 --> 05:20:29,630
Is there no one for me to jump the fence? I'm going to go for it when this guy passes here.

3538
05:20:30,270 --> 05:21:18,369
Ready? One, two, three. Did you see me? I probably have expensive shit in here.

3539
05:21:18,369 --> 05:21:22,430
Come on, give me some intel. I can't get intel. I'm looking right at you.

3540
05:21:23,069 --> 05:22:23,259
What? Okay. The only two people that live here already got a guitar. Shit. Really? You'll never

3541
05:22:23,259 --> 05:22:50,720
get me on the roof. You'll never get me. Let's see. They're going to get out. Are you kidding

3542
05:22:50,720 --> 05:23:11,040
me? Come on. Damn it. Stop right there. All right. We're going to go. We're going to go

3543
05:23:11,040 --> 05:23:20,909
with a, we're going to go with a new tactic. It's called find a brick because I have not

3544
05:23:20,909 --> 05:23:25,630
seen one in this almost five and a half hours that this game has been played. Has

3545
05:23:25,630 --> 05:23:53,459
anybody seen a brick? Even one? Where the hell are they? On the sidewalks? You see

3546
05:23:53,459 --> 05:24:03,310
one right in front of the computer screen, do you? On the ground. Yeah, I know they're

3547
05:24:03,310 --> 05:24:22,419
on the ground, but whereabouts on the ground? Down alleys? There's one at the bus stop.

3548
05:24:23,060 --> 05:24:38,430
Well, there's not one at the bus stop, but over here. This kind of park bench area.

3549
05:24:40,979 --> 05:24:46,900
Some houses are made out of them. You know, you're right. They are. They are made out of

3550
05:24:46,900 --> 05:25:02,900
bricks. The first brick I find, we have to get some great shots. Sidewalks near houses.

3551
05:25:06,380 --> 05:25:55,599
Brick. Was it worth it? No, but that doesn't mean I can't get it through a window and

3552
05:25:55,599 --> 05:26:04,369
brick. I used to see in red bricks, not the cement looking cinder block bricks,

3553
05:26:06,099 --> 05:26:09,860
but I'm going to try and get it in windows. We'll play basketball from now on.

3554
05:26:10,500 --> 05:26:21,520
Now I'm going to go through that. I'm just going to throw bricks through windows. That's

3555
05:26:21,520 --> 05:26:33,040
pretty much the rest of the stream. I hope you guys are ready to play. I got to get some

3556
05:26:33,040 --> 05:26:45,330
good challenges here, but I can only get one brick. Try throwing it at a cop.

3557
05:26:45,970 --> 05:26:56,880
Laughing my ass off, poser. He's not going to get it through the window. Yes, I will.

3558
05:26:57,520 --> 05:27:18,930
If I could find one. I wish I had a brick right now. I wish I had a brick right now.

3559
05:27:21,009 --> 05:28:07,630
Oh shit. I need this. Hey, oh, I can't get out. I can't get out of here. Why would you do that?

3560
05:28:07,630 --> 05:28:34,099
Oh, thank you. What? I didn't get a chance. Why would you close the crazed psycho in the

3561
05:28:34,099 --> 05:28:48,130
garage with you? That's the last thing you'd want to do. Oh my God. This guy's going to

3562
05:28:48,130 --> 05:28:52,209
this guy's throwing bricks at me and he's running in here sprinting at me. It's scary.

3563
05:28:52,849 --> 05:28:56,770
Hey man, like you okay? What's up man? You like okay being locked in here with me?

3564
05:28:57,409 --> 05:29:19,150
Damn it. Let's sit right here. Let's see what that is. Way too low. Oh, that was close.

3565
05:29:27,409 --> 05:30:12,220
I just want them back. A new house. I have to get that. What? Throw a brick at the police.

3566
05:30:12,939 --> 05:30:17,979
I have to get a brick aimed in the right direction in the first place and not have one

3567
05:30:17,979 --> 05:30:28,909
spawn on top of me. You just had to throw them at the house with a security camera.

3568
05:30:29,869 --> 05:30:51,619
Bastard. I'll show this asshole. You're gonna throw bricks at my neighbor. Okay, this is

3569
05:30:51,619 --> 05:31:02,590
actually easier to find bricks to go faster like this. All right, we've got four bricks

3570
05:31:02,590 --> 05:31:10,000
here. You thought you could stop me? You think your security cameras are gonna stop me?

3571
05:31:10,639 --> 05:32:00,619
Next time come to the PTA meeting motherfucker. Oh, it was so close. Just restart it.

3572
05:32:00,700 --> 05:32:07,860
I know what that is. Store bricks in your vehicle. Hold on. Can I put bricks in the car and just

3573
05:32:07,860 --> 05:33:05,200
have a never-ending rain bricks on somebody? What the fuck is he doing in the house already?

3574
05:33:05,200 --> 05:33:24,860
Jesus. Oh, is your husband the cop? My guy the call came. He got that inside the house.

3575
05:33:24,860 --> 05:33:29,659
He was getting ready for work. Perfect place to store these. Perfect place. Perfect checkpoint.

3576
05:33:29,659 --> 05:33:32,639
All right, we're gonna go for the we're gonna get a bunch of bricks in here.

3577
05:33:33,200 --> 05:33:52,220
Oops. I don't think you can do this.

3578
05:33:58,479 --> 05:34:05,200
I hate this car. Car's giving me nothing but trouble.

3579
05:34:10,689 --> 05:34:36,849
So bad. No, what are you doing? I didn't even cross the line. So, okay, you can't,

3580
05:34:37,569 --> 05:34:42,580
so you can't put the bricks in the cars. I have to break a window with a brick before

3581
05:34:42,580 --> 05:34:52,560
I turn the stream off. I'm sorry, I have to. I mean, I'm pretty much got my fill of the

3582
05:34:52,560 --> 05:34:58,479
game. This game's pretty fun. If there's more content here, that'd be, it'd be better.

3583
05:34:58,479 --> 05:35:04,819
There's more like neighborhoods. I'm sure there probably is, but I mean, I need to end this

3584
05:35:04,819 --> 05:35:24,529
with a brick throw through a window. This is gonna keep needing to happen. What was that

3585
05:35:24,529 --> 05:35:45,740
spot? It was back in front of the 101, right? Right here. Bricks. Aren't they like

3586
05:35:45,740 --> 05:35:53,700
right here? I can't, you can't steal cars in this game. They're usually like right here.

3587
05:35:54,500 --> 05:36:17,180
Where do my bricks go? Oh, they're right there. Okay. All right. I have to get this.

3588
05:36:18,220 --> 05:36:33,470
That window right there. The same guy every day comes and tries to throw a

3589
05:36:33,470 --> 05:36:41,340
fucking brick through your window. Yes! I did it!

3590
05:37:01,490 --> 05:37:01,970
Underneath.

3591
05:37:04,700 --> 05:37:15,090
What time is it? Let me just have a couple sips of coffee here.

3592
05:37:17,180 --> 05:37:22,580
That's a nice, bold, rich flavor. Honey, what are you doing? Are you going to work? Okay.

3593
05:37:25,279 --> 05:37:30,830
Goodbye, kids. I'll see you later. Okay, have a great day. All right, now I'll do what I do

3594
05:37:30,830 --> 05:37:42,580
every day. Let's sound good in the newspaper there. Mr. Jordan, nice to see you. Line it up

3595
05:37:42,580 --> 05:37:56,020
here. Right there. A little too high. A little too much. I'm gonna go over the bathroom window

3596
05:37:56,020 --> 05:38:32,000
tonight. See if I can maybe hit one of them. Got one. Have a nice day. See you tomorrow. Same

3597
05:38:32,000 --> 05:38:57,119
time. How much does he get paid? Nothing. He won the scratch off lottery 25 years ago.

3598
05:38:57,840 --> 05:39:18,259
Dude, hit the mega millions. We've got nothing else to do. This time, let's go for somebody's

3599
05:39:18,259 --> 05:39:35,599
head. Oh, we got an open door. Open, open, open, open. Throwing bricks into the house

3600
05:39:35,599 --> 05:39:59,970
at this point. Anybody up there? Oh my god! It would have been right in his head.

3601
05:40:06,240 --> 05:40:39,470
Me! Hold on. Hold on. Stay there. Come here. I need to ask you a very important question.

3602
05:40:39,630 --> 05:41:06,049
You have to stand right in front of me. Right here. Don't move. That was too far to the left.

3603
05:41:32,209 --> 05:41:37,099
I have to do it. I ran out of stuff to do in the game, but for some reason,

3604
05:41:37,099 --> 05:41:48,349
I'm not leaving the game. I'm still here. I haven't left yet. I'm done. They ran that

3605
05:41:48,349 --> 05:41:57,060
lady over. That's fine. I have to get it. It's gonna happen. You'll see it. We can all go,

3606
05:41:57,139 --> 05:42:21,549
what the heck? Oh my god, he did it! Perfect. Oh my god. Oh my god. Fucking Jesus Christ.

3607
05:42:28,590 --> 05:42:34,060
Right there. Stop. Stop. Why are you getting so close? Some of them keep moving.

3608
05:42:39,090 --> 05:43:15,220
I think that my computer lagged, but yeah. Do they have a hurtbox? Yeah, they do. Oh,

3609
05:43:15,220 --> 05:43:32,509
fuck me. All right, the last attempt. I'm gonna try this one more time. I can't go

3610
05:43:32,509 --> 05:43:42,450
to sleep until you do this. I can't go to sleep until I do this. That looks good. No!

3611
05:43:54,830 --> 05:44:47,459
Oh my god. I can't believe it. I got a better idea. Block him with the car? That's not a

3612
05:44:47,459 --> 05:44:54,240
bad idea. Which way are you gonna go? I think I can get this though. You just go right there

3613
05:44:54,240 --> 05:45:12,380
like that. It should be it right here. Did it land? All right, I'm gonna block him with the

3614
05:45:12,380 --> 05:45:31,889
car. Did anybody hear it? No landing sound means hit. All right, well, we're gonna have

3615
05:45:32,450 --> 05:45:37,520
to block this. I'm sorry, guys. Like if you thought you were gonna see something here.

3616
05:45:38,319 --> 05:45:47,700
Stream's been over for 10-20 minutes. I'm just like kind of winding down. This is like just

3617
05:45:47,700 --> 05:46:02,080
like a me time right now. You know what I mean? It's just a little me time. All right,

3618
05:46:02,080 --> 05:46:16,159
where are they? We'll put that away. Why am I losing my place right now? I'm losing my

3619
05:46:16,159 --> 05:46:30,799
place. Right here. All right, stay there. Stay there. Don't move. It's like right here.

3620
05:46:50,110 --> 05:46:55,860
Oh my god. Why? That's as close as you could possibly be without a heading.

3621
05:47:38,860 --> 05:47:42,700
That wasn't even funny. It was only funny because his facial expression didn't change

3622
05:47:42,700 --> 05:47:58,990
at all. Uh, what am I doing still? Why am I still here? I haven't, I can't leave.

3623
05:47:59,549 --> 05:48:39,540
I don't think I can leave. Oh, all right. I got, I'm out of here. I'm done. Hey,

3624
05:48:39,540 --> 05:48:51,580
thanks for coming to the stream, everybody. That was fun. Can you crush, no, you, you,

3625
05:48:51,580 --> 05:49:00,340
you can, you, look, you can like hurt people. It's not the way you think. People, uh, there's

3626
05:49:00,340 --> 05:49:09,419
no, nobody dies. Nobody gets hurt. The admission ends. But that was fun. Thanks everybody for

3627
05:49:09,419 --> 05:49:16,979
sticking around. By the way, if you didn't know, uh, there's a poll that is hanging

3628
05:49:16,979 --> 05:49:23,040
around here. I talked about it in the first, uh, probably five minutes of the stream, but

3629
05:49:23,040 --> 05:49:30,479
this, if you could please vote on this poll, pick your favorite one for the green screen.

3630
05:49:30,479 --> 05:49:34,880
One of these actions, you got to pick one for your favorite because there was a lot of meme

3631
05:49:35,520 --> 05:49:43,500
shit. There was a lot of meme responses and of the hundred and like 75 different actions,

3632
05:49:43,500 --> 05:49:53,229
uh, the top three here are going to be included as well. So I put the memes in one thing. I

3633
05:49:53,229 --> 05:49:56,669
don't know when it happened. I mean, I know what some of this stuff does. I mean,

3634
05:49:56,669 --> 05:50:01,950
I know what like the Macarena is. I don't know what Jojo poses are. I know what the

3635
05:50:01,950 --> 05:50:05,389
sunglasses is and how the Sonic run is. The John Travolta thing, Dark Souls,

3636
05:50:06,270 --> 05:50:18,500
the bee video. I know what these are, but the date for the green screen has changed to Friday.

3637
05:50:18,500 --> 05:50:26,880
So Friday, I figured more people will be able to hang out. We could just relax. So it's

3638
05:50:26,880 --> 05:50:29,919
not on a week night. Well, Friday is technically a week night, but it's right before the

3639
05:50:29,919 --> 05:50:33,439
weekend. So I figured a lot of you guys would have a little bit easier of a time to

3640
05:50:33,439 --> 05:50:40,830
hang out and go if you wanted to. Uh, what time Friday? That is the real question. It's

3641
05:50:40,830 --> 05:50:48,560
probably going to be around, I would say three or four PM Eastern. That's the thought.

3642
05:50:49,740 --> 05:50:53,900
I don't know the exact time that I'll be in the studio because they're still

3643
05:50:54,459 --> 05:50:58,540
kind of working that out. So I, it's probably going to be in the afternoon,

3644
05:51:02,500 --> 05:51:08,080
but thank you everybody for hanging out. That was, I didn't expect to play six hours of

3645
05:51:08,080 --> 05:51:12,319
Thief Simulator. I was really under the impression that I was going to do that and

3646
05:51:12,319 --> 05:51:18,000
then like go play Hitman or go play like Delta Rune or something. But, uh, Hitman is out.

3647
05:51:19,040 --> 05:51:29,889
I will see you guys tomorrow. So tomorrow, which is Wednesday, we will be playing,

3648
05:51:31,200 --> 05:51:38,049
uh, Hitman 2 or Delta Rune, one of those two. Thief Simulator over Delta Rune. Well,

3649
05:51:38,049 --> 05:51:41,090
I did a vote before the stream started and people wanted to see this game.

3650
05:51:41,729 --> 05:51:48,799
I hope you had fun. Thanks for sticking around. It's getting late. I know for a lot of you guys, so

3651
05:51:49,520 --> 05:51:56,639
take care. Much love to you. Uh, but tomorrow I'll be in the chat hanging out. We'll figure

3652
05:51:56,639 --> 05:52:02,340
out if I'm going to do Hitman or Delta Rune because once I start Hitman, I kind of,

3653
05:52:02,340 --> 05:52:06,819
I'm kind of going to play it for at least three or four streams in a row, I would assume,

3654
05:52:06,819 --> 05:52:14,080
because I loved the first one so much. So maybe, I don't know, maybe we'll do Delta

3655
05:52:14,080 --> 05:52:19,490
Rune tomorrow and then Hitman after the green screen stream or Hitman on Thursday and then,

3656
05:52:19,490 --> 05:52:22,930
but we'll see. I got to figure that out because I don't have a schedule yet really.

3657
05:52:24,479 --> 05:52:30,479
But, uh, we'll see. Vote on that poll. I have tons of suggestions. It's going to be a lot

3658
05:52:30,479 --> 05:52:36,619
of fun. The green screen stream is set to go on Friday and I will see you guys later.

3659
05:52:36,619 --> 05:52:47,099
And for that, let's go back to earlier today and let's go through the bits. Take care,

3660
05:52:47,099 --> 05:52:54,049
everybody. And let's start with the outro, which should have been on already, but it wasn't.

3661
05:52:55,810 --> 05:52:58,930
All right. Thank you, Benny Toe for the two dollars. Hey, Jerma, I know this is a weird

3662
05:52:58,930 --> 05:53:02,849
question, but, uh, when you and italics wake up, does it happen that both of you guys,

3663
05:53:04,130 --> 05:53:08,240
uh, have, uh, brush our teeth? We do. We do brush our teeth every morning,

3664
05:53:08,240 --> 05:53:11,200
Benny. Thanks for the two bucks. Uh, Flubba Gut, thanks for the one dollar

3665
05:53:11,200 --> 05:53:15,759
gun. Interview for an apprenticeship in IT tomorrow at 10 AM. Got to get my Jerma fix

3666
05:53:15,759 --> 05:53:25,459
if I'm going to be confident. Good luck to you, Flubba Gut. Take care. Hope it goes well.

3667
05:53:25,459 --> 05:53:31,599
If you're not here anymore, well, we wish you the best. MostlyLost, thanks for the one dollar.

3668
05:53:31,599 --> 05:53:35,040
To be honest, I only donated to this channel to help italics pay for his house.

3669
05:53:40,939 --> 05:53:47,090
That doesn't make any sense. Thank you MostlyLost for the one dollar, though. Thank you too.

3670
05:53:47,090 --> 05:53:50,369
Bake me home for the two bucks. What games are you looking forward to in 2019?

3671
05:53:51,540 --> 05:54:01,709
Um, I mean, Smash Brothers comes out in 2018. Uh, February or March, what was it, uh,

3672
05:54:02,909 --> 05:54:05,630
the From Software game launches in March or February, right?

3673
05:54:07,700 --> 05:54:17,299
Shadows Die Twice should be awesome. Yeah, yes, you can absolutely expect streams of that game.

3674
05:54:19,389 --> 05:54:24,979
Sekiro, yeah, there it is. Looking forward to that one, but besides that, I'm not really

3675
05:54:24,979 --> 05:54:30,580
too sure. I'd have to take a look at what's coming out. Thank you Devakitty for the one

3676
05:54:30,580 --> 05:54:34,740
dollar. Jojo poses aren't a stupid meme thing. It's just that Jojo poses are awesome and it

3677
05:54:34,740 --> 05:54:40,259
would be fun. Well, that's up to you guys. I'm not going to give an opinion on them,

3678
05:54:40,819 --> 05:54:49,979
but thank you. Uh, HasNain, thanks for the 15 bucks HasNain. 15 dollars from HasNain and

3679
05:54:50,060 --> 05:55:01,250
they say Zoworldo. Zoworldo. Zoworldo. Thank you. Uh, that's a lot of money. Thanks a lot.

3680
05:55:01,250 --> 05:55:07,419
Thank you to Good Sir Reginald for the one dollar. That's it. Just one dollar. Thank you.

3681
05:55:08,990 --> 05:55:12,909
Manboy, thanks for the one dollar. These are some Jojo poses. Have fun making them.

3682
05:55:30,110 --> 05:55:37,090
I'm not going to do all of these. There's like a hundred of these. How many of these do I

3683
05:55:37,090 --> 05:55:48,590
have to do? I'm not going to do them. I'll pick out like a few of them maybe, but I'm not,

3684
05:55:48,590 --> 05:55:51,950
that's not even certain that that's what I'm doing by the way. The poll is not even done,

3685
05:55:52,590 --> 05:56:03,900
but anyways, thank you Manboy. Uh, that's an interesting thing that I'm about to do in a

3686
05:56:03,900 --> 05:56:08,060
few days. Uh, Darkstar, thanks for the one dollar Darkstar. Can we send you meme videos

3687
05:56:08,060 --> 05:56:12,860
to watch during bit readings outside of the movie night? No. I'm going to make that really,

3688
05:56:12,860 --> 05:56:17,979
really clear that because of the amount of footage and the amount of random stuff,

3689
05:56:18,860 --> 05:56:24,540
there is way I can't like pre-screen that stuff unless it's going to be for a specific movie night.

3690
05:56:25,259 --> 05:56:30,700
So outside of that movie night, I'm not going to click on like green screen, Jerma,

3691
05:56:31,580 --> 05:56:36,939
me in something because I can't pre-screen them and there could be some awful shit that I

3692
05:56:36,939 --> 05:56:41,979
don't want to like show or watch. You know what I mean? So unfortunately outside of the

3693
05:56:41,979 --> 05:56:44,939
maybe one or two movie nights that we do, it, that's going to be kind of, that's going

3694
05:56:44,939 --> 05:56:55,069
to be it. How often will movie night be? Um, I don't have like a set time or, you know,

3695
05:56:55,069 --> 05:56:59,869
duration. It's just something I wanted to do. We'll see how the first one goes. If there's a

3696
05:56:59,869 --> 05:57:04,430
lot of great submissions, then obviously we'll do it over the course of, you know, a couple

3697
05:57:04,430 --> 05:57:14,720
of streams, maybe if it takes that long. But yeah, thank you Darkstar, 700,000 games.

3698
05:57:15,439 --> 05:57:19,409
Thank you SinisterCorn for the five dollars. SinisterCorn, thanks a lot. Hey Jerma,

3699
05:57:19,409 --> 05:57:26,700
I'm shit-faced. I hope you're not shit-faced. Enjoy streaming. Uh, not tonight though. No wine

3700
05:57:26,700 --> 05:57:32,450
tonight, but hopefully you enjoyed your night. Thanks a lot for the five dollars SinisterCorn.

3701
05:57:36,189 --> 05:57:40,779
Googly-Garrett, thanks for the five dollars. Hey Jerma, I missed the labo bit train,

3702
05:57:40,779 --> 05:57:44,619
but I just wanted to say thank you again for being the wonderful goof ball you are.

3703
05:57:44,619 --> 05:57:49,659
Was super happy you enjoyed my animation and had it put on the second Jerma channel. Here's

3704
05:57:49,659 --> 05:57:54,299
some bits for being so humble. Also, I am at a drawing that Snoozing Copter made. I thought

3705
05:57:54,299 --> 05:57:56,860
you would enjoy it. Here it is. Thanks again for the years of entertainment.

3706
05:57:57,819 --> 05:58:07,459
Uh, thank you Googly-Garrett. Uh, your animation was fucking hilarious, so absolutely.

3707
05:58:08,020 --> 05:58:18,189
And let's take a look at this. Oh, it's a gift. It's a gift cat. Oh, that's awesome.

3708
05:58:19,520 --> 05:58:22,159
Have I seen this before? I think I feel like I've seen this.

3709
05:58:23,040 --> 05:58:41,810
If I haven't, then I'm mistaken, but it's awesome. The cat police. Yeah, the wrong clip.

3710
05:58:41,810 --> 05:58:53,060
Yep. That's that. Very, very good animation. But thank you Googly-Garrett. Thanks for sticking

3711
05:58:53,060 --> 05:58:59,700
around and thanks for being a very talented animator. So, because a lot of people enjoyed

3712
05:58:59,700 --> 05:59:05,229
that. I'm one of them. Thank you FlubbaGut for the one dollar. Who the hell leaves stacks of

3713
05:59:05,229 --> 05:59:12,860
dollars lying around in shelving units? Whose house is this? DivUSP, thanks for three

3714
05:59:12,860 --> 05:59:18,880
dollars. No message. Thank you Div. Again, Div, you give pretty much every single stream

3715
05:59:19,520 --> 05:59:25,779
and although you don't necessarily write messages every single time, thank you. I see your name

3716
05:59:25,779 --> 05:59:34,419
pop up very frequently, so sometimes I see you do write stuff, but thank you. It means a lot.

3717
05:59:35,810 --> 05:59:39,889
LSG Icarus, thanks for the two bucks. Wait, so pots and pans are worth a normal amount

3718
05:59:39,889 --> 05:59:43,250
of money in this game, but a laptop costs fifty two thousand dollars. Well, that's a

3719
05:59:43,250 --> 05:59:48,750
hacking laptop. It means it has special hacking software built into it. So that's,

3720
05:59:49,389 --> 05:59:52,930
you're paying for the brand. You know, it's like Apple. It's the same computer,

3721
05:59:53,569 --> 06:00:07,569
but are you paying fifty two thousand dollars more money? That says the guy that has an iPhone

3722
06:00:07,569 --> 06:00:16,259
and an iPad. Kind of a hypocrite if you ask me. Talking about this guy. Thank you

3723
06:00:16,259 --> 06:00:19,779
Superintendent Chalmers for the one dollar. I ever think of enabling the better twitch.tv

3724
06:00:20,419 --> 06:00:28,459
animated emotes like clap so we can applaud when you do cool things. I don't even have

3725
06:00:28,459 --> 06:00:46,819
better twitch.tv. I have just regular, not even night mode twitch. I can't see Sour Please. No,

3726
06:00:46,819 --> 06:00:51,759
I don't even know what it is. I know it's like a guy dancing. That's all I know.

3727
06:01:00,080 --> 06:01:02,799
You don't use, no I don't use night mode and I don't have better twitch.tv.

3728
06:01:05,569 --> 06:01:11,580
Guys, remember, this is important. Listen, I didn't have a custom HUD in Team Fortress.

3729
06:01:11,580 --> 06:01:16,619
I played with just the default minimal HUD. I didn't have a custom HUD in World of Warcraft

3730
06:01:16,619 --> 06:01:29,060
either. I think maybe I had one small change, but I do. I just go default, man. Yeah, really,

3731
06:01:29,060 --> 06:01:34,110
that's for real. I think I only had a custom HUD in any of these games maybe one time over

3732
06:01:34,110 --> 06:01:42,740
the course of a few, maybe like a month maybe. You can't see my name in light mode. I actually

3733
06:01:42,740 --> 06:01:48,849
can't. I can't see that. Let me see. I can't see your name. I have no idea who you are.

3734
06:01:50,209 --> 06:01:54,189
You're just a mystery person. I don't know who you are. I can't even

3735
06:01:54,189 --> 06:01:56,590
uh select and scroll.

3736
06:02:01,659 --> 06:02:07,700
There are people that told me that I had like pixels on some of my emotes that weren't erased

3737
06:02:07,700 --> 06:02:16,299
and I can't see them because I have light mode on. But anyways, thank you super seal

3738
06:02:17,180 --> 06:02:20,939
for the one dollar. Sorry to ruin the good mood, but because you live in Las Vegas,

3739
06:02:20,939 --> 06:02:23,979
I really should know this. Remember to lock all of your doors and windows.

3740
06:02:24,860 --> 06:02:34,340
And uh call the police when you see this man. It's just like a claymation thing. What is this?

3741
06:02:35,139 --> 06:02:46,369
I don't understand what it's just like. It's like a claymation thing. Thank you super seal.

3742
06:02:47,169 --> 06:02:54,509
I'll be sure to take care of myself. Thank you. It's sir. Thank you. It's Ross Garra.

3743
06:02:55,310 --> 06:03:04,819
Thank you. Oh, that was whoops. My bad. I'm gonna make mistakes. Thank you. Extra

3744
06:03:05,060 --> 06:03:11,009
cheesy for the ten dollars. Extra cheesy. Swiss is piss and cheddar is better. Use this money

3745
06:03:11,009 --> 06:03:17,599
to get some real cheese. I didn't say I hated cheddar. What? When did I? What did I say I hated

3746
06:03:17,599 --> 06:03:26,080
cheddar? I like cheddar, okay? I like cheddar. I just like Swiss a lot. But thank you for the

3747
06:03:26,080 --> 06:03:32,450
ten bucks. Extra cheesy. Fifteen actually. He says did you kill them? Who did I kill?

3748
06:03:33,009 --> 06:03:38,060
I don't know, but thanks for the fifteen dollars uh extra cheesy. It's a lot of money.

3749
06:03:38,060 --> 06:03:42,779
Enraged grandpa also gives ten bucks as well. Thanks for keeping the drunk me entertained.

3750
06:03:42,779 --> 06:03:50,419
But thank you drunk you for hanging out for the night. Hope you had a good time. Thank you so

3751
06:03:50,419 --> 06:03:55,759
much for the ten bucks. Uh good sir Reginald again thanks for the one dollar. They definitely

3752
06:03:55,759 --> 06:04:04,029
took a dump in your drywall. What? Enraged grandpa thank you for the five dollars again

3753
06:04:04,029 --> 06:04:11,569
here. Fifteen. Also take this because drunk me wants you to have it. So many people are

3754
06:04:11,569 --> 06:04:18,049
drunk on a Tuesday. Well uh you what? You want me to like oh how could they do something like

3755
06:04:18,049 --> 06:04:22,610
that? I was drunk on like a Thursday. What was that? That was like a Wednesday. When was that?

3756
06:04:23,419 --> 06:04:35,150
Was that Thursday? Hey it's five o'clock somewhere in the world. As long as you're

3757
06:04:35,150 --> 06:04:40,270
taking care of yourself and you're good to go and you have a few drinks that's all right.

3758
06:04:40,270 --> 06:04:45,459
There's nothing wrong with that. Just like I said know your limits. Know when it's like

3759
06:04:45,540 --> 06:04:51,599
time to be done and like make sure that you take care of yourself you know. It's not a big deal.

06:07:00,590 --> 06:07:04,029
I'd like to imagine this game is just you and Vinesauce high drinks when you are not

3778
06:07:04,029 --> 06:07:08,430
streaming. Just Vinnie telling you to break toilets and steal toasters and paper plates

3779
06:07:08,430 --> 06:07:13,229
from people's homes. Anyway my point is how many bits do I need to pay for you and Vinnie to

3780
06:07:13,229 --> 06:07:30,299
rob me? Uh not none. Okay I don't want to rob anybody. Do I know face cam? Oh I just I don't

3781
06:07:30,299 --> 06:07:34,860
really play with face cam. I have it when it's I find it to be necessary or when I have something

3782
06:07:34,860 --> 06:07:40,000
I want to say or something I want to do but I don't know. I typically do not play with face cam.

3783
06:07:41,970 --> 06:07:46,560
You'll see my face plenty though. He'll rob you for free.

3784

3835
06:14:11,200 --> 06:14:16,380
the greatest 10 minutes of streaming history I think on this I think is when the dog was

3836
06:14:16,380 --> 06:14:21,900
rolling around in pee and the guy was walking a dog in his own house for the sims I I mean I

06:14:31,439 --> 06:14:36,740
around in pee I don't think I'll ever be able to laugh that hard at anything I really

3840
06:14:36,740 --> 06:14:46,209
don't think so that may have been one of the funniest things I've ever seen I don't know

This one in particular left me violently cry laughing several times

3872
06:19:22,180 --> 06:19:26,819
Also, the lockpicking in this game is pretty realistic. I know because I had to do it when I got trapped in a walk-in oven

3873
06:19:27,500 --> 06:19:31,479
Sorry to hear that. Thank you. Smackles more for the one dollar. Thank you. Devokitty for the one dollar

3874
06:19:33,680 --> 06:19:35,360
jokes aside

3875
06:19:35,360 --> 06:19:42,520
Finder keepers has no legal merit legally speaking any stone or lost object you find if a judge deems that you didn't go

3876
06:19:42,520 --> 06:19:44,159
Through reasonable steps to find the owner

3877
06:19:44,200 --> 06:19:47,919
It's theft by finding of course if you find $20 on the ground

3878
06:19:47,919 --> 06:19:51,119
I hardly doubt the people will call the cops on you

3879
06:19:51,119 --> 06:19:55,700
But otherwise, you'll have committed a crime finders keepers has no legal merit

3880
06:19:55,700 --> 06:19:59,180
But okay legally speaking if you steal a knob

3881
06:19:59,180 --> 06:20:03,689
If you find an object on the ground and you didn't reasonably try to find the owner

3882
06:20:03,810 --> 06:20:07,909
So if you find a briefcase on the side of the road with ten grand in it

3883
06:20:07,909 --> 06:20:14,229
We are you gonna put up flyers on the highway found ten grand. Please call me

3884
06:20:20,180 --> 06:20:29,279
Hey, you found ten grand it's my ten grand what how you gonna do that your phones gonna ring off the hook all day

3885
06:20:29,500 --> 06:20:35,700
Hey, I heard you found ten grand. Oh, yeah, I was driving on the road. I fell out of my pocket

3886
06:20:35,700 --> 06:20:37,700
Oh shit, how can I come get it?

3887
06:20:37,900 --> 06:20:46,759
You have to ask him how much money it is

3888
06:20:46,759 --> 06:20:53,459
You can't just put all the cards out right at the beginning to say lost briefcase

3889
06:21:04,650 --> 06:21:08,740
Lost briefcase

3890
06:21:09,139 --> 06:21:14,759
Yeah, but okay. So on that flyer you just gonna write I found a lost briefcase

3891
06:21:15,380 --> 06:21:21,659
You know how many people lose their briefcases every day people that fly on

3892
06:21:22,740 --> 06:21:27,540
Airlines right now lost their briefcase today of like the

3893
06:21:28,360 --> 06:21:40,479
50,000 people that lost their luggage this afternoon who's gonna call you but on the side of a highway

3894
06:21:41,080 --> 06:21:43,080
Yeah, but I mean you could just

3895
06:21:45,680 --> 06:21:56,659
Take away the side of the highway when they call you ask what's in it. What if they guess

3896
06:21:57,340 --> 06:22:02,979
Like what if it was ten grand and something else and the guys like oh, yeah

3897
06:22:02,979 --> 06:22:05,779
I feel like you I've seen you you may have found my briefcase

3898
06:22:05,779 --> 06:22:13,590
Well, I had ten thousand dollars in that briefcase and a Mega Man sticker and he's just taking a wild fucking guess

3899
06:22:13,590 --> 06:22:18,310
And there's a Mega Man sticker in there, but he it's like fuck man. What could he could he just guessed?

3900
06:22:19,150 --> 06:22:27,340

3915
06:23:34,659 --> 06:23:48,610
Hey ever heard of a razor? You have to write your name on every single dollar

3916
06:23:51,240 --> 06:23:53,240
Handcuff it to your wrist

3917
06:23:56,580 --> 06:24:02,340
I'm gonna do an experiment. I'm gonna know never mind. I can't like say this but like

3918
06:24:03,580 --> 06:24:05,580
Wouldn't it be funny if all?

3919
06:24:06,419 --> 06:24:10,200
Joking here, but wouldn't it be funny if this joke I'm about to say

3920
06:24:10,819 --> 06:24:14,700
like if I just put like a thousand dollars in a briefcase and

3921
06:24:15,799 --> 06:24:17,979
put it on the side of a road and

3922
06:24:19,900 --> 06:24:32,259
Just say what happened. I mean put flyers up and shit. That's a social experiment. Yeah, I'm not gonna do one of those

3923
06:24:32,860 --> 06:24:40,779
We get stolen

3924
06:24:44,180 --> 06:24:50,139
We'd be like we'd be like like staked out like camped out while watching it like oh shit here comes a car

3925
06:24:50,139 --> 06:24:54,979
He's pulled up. Oh, man. What's he gonna do that? There's a grant in that brief. He has a fucking cash

3926
06:24:54,979 --> 06:24:58,259
Oh, wait, hold me. He's like, oh, he's looking at it. He's opening it up

3927
06:24:59,590 --> 06:25:02,049
Okay, man. He's he's scooping out all the cash

3928
06:25:02,569 --> 06:25:08,520
Yeah, I think he's got probably he's gonna go he's going in his crate through the briefcase as hard as he could into the woods

3929
06:25:09,279 --> 06:25:11,520
All the money just went into his pocket

3930
06:25:12,040 --> 06:25:16,520
Okay, but like hold on. Hey, hello ahead. He's in the car. He's stepping on the gas

3931
06:25:17,200 --> 06:25:19,360
Then anybody gets played he's gone. That guy's gone

3932
06:25:19,959 --> 06:25:28,169
And that would be it. That'd be the whole thing. Why won't you take the case with you?

3933
06:25:28,650 --> 06:25:30,950
Because like you don't want the evidence

3934
06:25:31,430 --> 06:25:38,240
How do I know he's stepping on the gas because his car peels out and he fucking goes 80 miles per hour on the highway

3935
06:25:38,959 --> 06:25:46,959
I wonder what happened. You would just lose a grant

3936
06:25:47,040 --> 06:25:51,340
Oh

3937
06:25:51,340 --> 06:25:56,680
Put a GPS in it. Yeah, but then like yeah, I guess

3938
06:26:01,840 --> 06:26:03,680
Funny just like a skit

3939
06:26:03,680 --> 06:26:07,759
We're gonna do a social experiment. We try to find out what happens if somebody finds

3940
06:26:08,439 --> 06:26:12,880
$10,000 in a briefcase and they just fucking take it and that's it

3941
06:26:13,400 --> 06:26:27,000

Yo germ our DND session was Sunday and basically the Castle Griffin Steed arc takes 20 years after Carl went in

4049
06:37:15,990 --> 06:37:20,560
No one has heard from him ever since and Elvin Woods next champion is a brute named Trog

4050
06:37:21,279 --> 06:37:26,759
He yells his own name when he's hurt and runs into battle. We ended up going by the abandoned wagon

4051
06:37:26,759 --> 06:37:31,959
That was a big mistake and had to fight a giant rat deeper in the dungeon. We got to Al Goro

4052
06:37:31,959 --> 06:37:36,400
He was a real boss instead of a one-shot and Trog ended up dying because he ran in headfirst

4053
06:37:36,400 --> 06:37:38,900
Like he always does we'll keep you updated

4054
06:37:39,380 --> 06:37:51,250
Well, they gotta stay away from that wagon. Did you touch the wagon? That's probably what happened, but I'm glad your session went well

4055
06:37:51,650 --> 06:37:53,650
That sounds like a lot of fun

4056
06:37:53,650 --> 06:37:56,720
Thank You Valukey and

4057
06:37:56,720 --> 06:37:58,479
Docs and thanks to the one dollar boy. Oh boy

4058
06:37:58,479 --> 06:38:03,159
I just got robbed 12 times in a week and some asshole threw bricks through my window three times

4059
06:38:03,360 --> 06:38:06,919
I'm giving you this money. So maybe it'll be a good some good karma to make him go away

4060
06:38:06,919 --> 06:38:12,720
I heard from Paul that he was screaming about China and interrupted his midnight work twice

4061
06:38:13,159 --> 06:38:24,569
Who the fuck even is this guy golly good gracious? I sure do hope the wacky police stop him. Thank you and Docs and

4062
06:38:25,090 --> 06:38:37,779
Thank You thievious for the two bucks. This is for the upcoming grand reveal of your

4063
06:38:39,169 --> 06:38:41,049
Stand up power

4064
06:38:41,049 --> 06:38:44,689
Stando power during a green screen and he goes

4065
06:38:45,330 --> 06:38:48,639
Rye why

4066
06:38:49,560 --> 06:38:51,979
Rye

4067
06:38:51,979 --> 06:39:01,540
Wr. I don't get it. I don't understand. I'm sorry. I meant the elephant green screen. Anyway, look elephant

4068
06:39:05,560 --> 06:39:10,009
Elephant green screen. There's no elephant on there. I'm like I don't like it

4069
06:39:11,209 --> 06:39:16,090
$12,000 animal surprise for you guys. They're looking of right under like into the studio on an elephant

4070
06:39:22,099 --> 06:39:26,720
Thank you. The orange pyro ranger for the one dollar. I hope you're not too overwhelmed by the Jojo poses

4071
06:39:28,360 --> 06:39:34,860
You know, maybe I'll just veto the Jojo poses and put dab back on the list

4072
06:39:38,500 --> 06:39:40,500
Everyone's so convinced

4073
06:39:41,180 --> 06:39:50,819
Now I already I already made already did my veto choices can't go back on them

4074
06:39:50,819 --> 06:39:53,540
No, just as long as I don't have to do the gnome video. I

4075
06:39:54,099 --> 06:40:05,369
would rather

4076
06:40:05,369 --> 06:40:09,599
Like I would rather think get a bad burn

4077
06:40:10,200 --> 06:40:12,860
Then recreate the gnome video

4078
06:40:13,599 --> 06:40:18,529
But I would rather like fall off a bike

4079
06:40:19,169 --> 06:40:23,580
Going like 15 miles per hour then recreate the gnome video

4080
06:40:24,139 --> 06:40:43,169
just do that if I had the option you can either recreate the whole gnome video or

4081
06:40:44,209 --> 06:40:49,810
Hold the handlebars and let the wheels spin downhill and intentionally fall over on the bike

4082
06:40:50,450 --> 06:40:52,619
I'd be like, oh

4083
06:40:52,860 --> 06:40:57,680
Well, I thought be okay in a few days like it would probably take like maybe a week or two of recovery

4084
06:40:58,279 --> 06:41:00,279
That I had my bones would heal

4085
06:41:00,560 --> 06:41:03,319
But I would never be able to get rid of

4086
06:41:04,119 --> 06:41:08,759
People making me a gnome in the gnome video that would last forever. That would last for life

4087
06:41:09,159 --> 06:41:29,340
Bones heal man. Haha. Jeremy fell off a bike, but thank you. Thank you extra cheesy again for one dollar here

4088
06:41:29,340 --> 06:41:31,979
Jeremy you are the first person I ever gave virtual currency to is

4089
06:41:32,819 --> 06:41:35,500
Steal the China the new toy boat

4090
06:41:35,860 --> 06:41:41,299
Well, steal the China is not a tongue twister

4091
06:41:41,299 --> 06:41:44,819
Steal the China is a painting steal the China is what you

4092
06:41:45,180 --> 06:41:49,659
Chant when you're breaking into a person's house that has that painting. That's the only time it's useful

4093
06:41:50,259 --> 06:41:58,299
Thank you. Hey bro. Look, thanks for the five dollars. Hey mate feeling pretty hungry

4094
06:41:58,299 --> 06:42:04,110
But only had like ten bucks left in my bank account. Have it. Why would you give me half of that?

4095
06:42:04,110 --> 06:42:05,549
Go get like food

4096
06:42:05,549 --> 06:42:12,700
Hey mate feeling pretty hungry, but only had ten dollars left my bank account. Have it you have

4097
06:42:13,259 --> 06:42:16,389
You can eat go you can eat something don't

4098
06:42:16,830 --> 06:42:18,430
Take care of yourself first

4099
06:42:18,430 --> 06:42:21,139
But thank you

4100
06:42:21,139 --> 06:42:24,220
Devakati, thanks for the one dollar. They say you w you

4101
06:42:24,939 --> 06:42:26,880
glumps

4102
06:42:26,880 --> 06:42:30,659
Within there's two asterisks next to it. Thank you

4103
06:42:31,580 --> 06:42:35,380
Cosmic Moses, thanks for the one dollar. Thank you for attempting to reenact this scene for almost an hour

4104
06:42:35,900 --> 06:42:49,709
We're recreating this scene

4105
06:42:49,990 --> 06:42:57,500
It's funny. You mentioned that because me and my brother

4106
06:42:58,180 --> 06:43:00,180
That's from home alone

4107
06:43:00,659 --> 06:43:06,619
Me and my brother used to rewind the VHS and watch that part over and over again because it thought was the funniest part

4108
06:43:06,619 --> 06:43:07,779
in the whole movie

4109
06:43:07,819 --> 06:43:13,740
He just whips as hard as he can. It's the only time in any of the two movies

4110
06:43:14,180 --> 06:43:17,540
That there's ever a real violent retaliation

4111
06:43:18,139 --> 06:43:24,229
to Kevin McCallister who is you know, the main character the only point in the whole movie and

4112
06:43:24,709 --> 06:43:29,130
He's trying to hit him with a brick in the fucking head as hard as he can

4113
06:43:29,509 --> 06:43:38,619
He throws it down as hard as he can like he's trying to kill Kevin McCallister here

4114
06:43:42,180 --> 06:43:46,860
Like if that he would have just killed Kevin

4115
06:43:47,459 --> 06:43:55,189
That brick would have hit him right in the fucking face. They say they're gonna kill him the whole movie

4116
06:43:55,189 --> 06:43:57,689
Yeah, they go like

4117
06:44:03,689 --> 06:44:06,970
But never is there any real violent retaliation like there is here

4118
06:44:07,369 --> 06:44:17,779
If you haven't seen that movie in a long time count the amount of times that Joe Pesci Joe Pesci says razza frazza

4119
06:44:18,419 --> 06:44:21,740
Marv is the real psycho

4120
06:44:21,779 --> 06:44:38,779
Just like the cartoon gibberish that Yosemite Sam used to do

4121
06:44:39,259 --> 06:44:46,110
But yes that cosmic mosaic that that is that is a great scene

4122
06:44:48,159 --> 06:44:52,040
Well, hold on like all right. That's a that's a great movie. It's a very funny movie

4123
06:44:55,020 --> 06:44:58,419
That's a great scene

4124
06:45:00,470 --> 06:45:02,669
Never mind

4125
06:45:02,669 --> 06:45:04,349
Thank you to

4126
06:45:04,349 --> 06:45:10,299
Brolok again gave $10 total Brolok. What the heck man. I'd like to have a laid-back chat

4127
06:45:10,299 --> 06:45:16,500
But the obvious plyer no racism or bigotry don't talk about politics and just try not to be a psycho

4128
06:45:17,139 --> 06:45:30,819
Yeah, copy and paste that for the rules of the green screen stream. Those are the rules there

4129
06:45:34,970 --> 06:45:41,049
Garfield the Monday killer click here to find out with one dollar sniff sniff. That's odd. Okay, there is a savory dog smell

4130
06:45:41,049 --> 06:45:43,049
Sorry, I ever doubted you right?

4131
06:45:43,490 --> 06:45:49,389
Well, what I what you didn't know was that all dogs are actually eldritch horrors with hypnotic sense

4132
06:45:49,669 --> 06:45:52,830
Make humans succumb to their will anyways, where's my ten bucks? I

4133
06:45:53,549 --> 06:46:04,380
Hope he does the meme dances from tick-tock. I'm not doing any I'm not doing any meme dances

4134
06:46:04,380 --> 06:46:06,380
They've already been taken off the table completely

4135
06:46:06,939 --> 06:46:12,509
They've already been vetoed. They've been pre vetoed even before I pre vetoed them. They were deleted

4136
06:46:12,509 --> 06:46:20,159
I don't know what that is, but I'm not gonna not doing it and finally Elizabeth

4137
06:46:20,159 --> 06:46:22,419
Thank you for the one dollar suck a brick out of my ass

4138
06:46:23,139 --> 06:46:26,680
It sounds like it would be very very uncomfortable

4139
06:46:27,680 --> 06:46:31,540
Thank you for the one dollar though. And now we're gonna go through the credits

4140
06:46:31,819 --> 06:46:37,169

4144
06:47:00,049 --> 06:47:07,049
Thursday Delta rune or hitman whatever we don't do on Wednesday will do on Thursday Friday green screen stream

4145
06:47:08,459 --> 06:47:10,459

Sunday nothing Monday. We're back. We'll see. Oh, maybe I'll maybe I'll stream on Sunday

4147
06:47:19,340 --> 06:47:21,340
Maybe we'll continue hitman on Sunday

4148
06:47:21,540 --> 06:47:31,240
German you're literally the last of my gaming channel subs that I consistently watch

4149
06:47:35,200 --> 06:47:38,459
That I'm glad you're here

4150
06:47:39,020 --> 06:47:50,439
I'm happy that you've been able to watch for this long. I can't keep up with all the vods. I know I've been streaming a lot

4151
06:47:50,959 --> 06:47:53,939
And these these friends have been going a long time, too

4152
06:47:54,540 --> 06:47:56,540
But I told you guys I

4153
06:47:58,040 --> 06:48:04,299
Came back I wasn't able to stream for three straight weeks, and I wanted to go

4154
06:48:04,860 --> 06:48:09,259
we've been doing a lot of seven eight nine hour streams the last couple weeks here and

4155
06:48:11,150 --> 06:48:13,619
I'm all for it. I'm having a great time

4156
06:48:13,619 --> 06:48:25,669
It's good to be back here on a scale of one to ten. How many apples have you eaten in the past two years?

4157
06:48:26,349 --> 06:48:30,880
Probably like 80. No, that's not even true. We'd be like two

4158
06:48:31,400 --> 06:48:36,479
No, no, no, no more than that. I'm gonna say like 15. No like 25

4159
06:48:37,000 --> 06:48:44,959
Ask about the dreamcast. I still have it. I still have the dreamcast. It'll have the PlayStation 2 back here

4160
06:48:44,959 --> 06:48:48,880
I make sure I made sure that they got to Vegas. So they're still here

4161
06:48:49,360 --> 06:48:53,889
Once the dust settles and all these brand new holiday releases. We will go back

4162
06:48:54,450 --> 06:48:57,689
We'll do a ton of dreamcast stuff. We'll finish the PlayStation 2 stuff

4163
06:48:58,409 --> 06:49:00,360
Because there's a lot

4164
06:49:00,360 --> 06:49:07,680
But we're in that mode right now where red dead hitman smash brothers

4165
06:49:15,259 --> 06:49:18,979
Delta rune, that's not enough. But let's say it was like a lot of games that are coming up

4166
06:49:19,220 --> 06:49:29,810
Am I gonna play Smash Brothers with fans? It is Nintendo's online policy

4167
06:49:30,349 --> 06:49:35,470
Hey, can you just jump into random lobbies or do you still need to give people like a 500-digit friend code?

4168
06:49:36,189 --> 06:49:41,560
Because I'll do whatever I can. I mean I was planning on playing it with as many people I wanted to

4169
06:49:49,970 --> 06:49:52,930
What are you guys doing? Why are you guys spelling quest?

4170
06:49:53,610 --> 06:49:57,770
But that is it. Thank you. There was a lot of subs

4171
06:49:58,450 --> 06:50:01,919
Thank you so much everybody for you continued

4172
06:50:04,400 --> 06:50:06,400
Monetary support of the channel. You guys are fucking amazing

4173
06:50:08,099 --> 06:50:12,979
We had two more. We had Tingy came in with a dollar. This is one more

4174
06:50:13,500 --> 06:50:22,099
It's this one. It's me on a bike. It's actually actually pretty relevant. So I'll give that one to you. That's pretty good and

4175
06:50:22,939 --> 06:50:28,330
Elizabeth thanks for the one dollar Vinnie talked about you landing in Vegas. Did you see this? Yeah. No, I saw that

4176
06:50:28,849 --> 06:50:31,220
He was cute. He was confused

4177
06:50:31,459 --> 06:50:36,409
Spent a little time in his dryer. We've talked about that, too

4178
