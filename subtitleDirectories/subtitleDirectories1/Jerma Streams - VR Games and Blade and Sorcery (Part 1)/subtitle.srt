1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:14,439
Can you fucking guys see me? Am I live? Hello? What's happening?

2
00:00:14,439 --> 00:00:30,410
Alright, that's really weird. Uh, my stream key. Something was fucking weird with my stream key.

3
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:33,770
When I was doing testing, remember earlier like an hour ago when I was doing like a test to make

4
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:40,119
sure we could stream at the same time? I got a stream key issue there. That was fucking weird.

5
00:00:40,119 --> 00:02:08,520
But anyways, uh, hold on a minute. Hey, let's do the- just pretend I'm not here for a second.

6
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:18,139
Alright, so I think- I think I'm ready. I think I'm ready to play. Should be good to go.

7
00:02:18,139 --> 00:02:24,740
Uh, let's just make sure that you can see that. And you can. Alright, okay, we're getting there.

8
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:37,689
I got a little cropping issue over here with my open VR. What is it? Wait, wait, what's this

9
00:02:37,689 --> 00:02:43,669
giant warning? If the control buttons don't work, please check the game windows. What?

10
00:02:43,669 --> 00:02:56,819
How do I get rid of this little fucking thing on the bottom left? Oh, I got it.

11
00:02:56,819 --> 00:03:18,740
Almost there. Looking good. Door exposed. What do I mean door exposed? Door exposed.

12
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:27,500
Oh, hi guys! How are you? Welcome to the stream! I think that's good. No, hold on a

13
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:39,580
second. So today, as you didn't know by the uh, the point I did, we're doing VR tonight.

14
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:49,479
Isn't that better? Yeah, well that's what we're gonna do, a test. Are you ready?

15
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:53,960
Here's the test, because I couldn't really tell from- before- you're gonna- I'm gonna blow

16
00:03:53,960 --> 00:04:21,079
your eardrums. Okay, so you guys need to tell me. So- so I'm in, okay? So I had the

17
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:24,199
chat program thing where you go like this and see the chat, but I couldn't get it to

18
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:29,050
fucking work. I tried so hard, and I'm gonna get that ready for tomorrow. But for today,

19
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:38,699
how does it sound? Does it sound like shit? Why is it that way? Why is the game that way?

20
00:04:46,250 --> 00:05:01,579
Why is the game that way? I'm peeking the mic. All right, what about now? Desync low

21
00:05:01,579 --> 00:05:07,660
quality. It's- it's desynced? Oh, wait, wait, wait, come on, ready? What do you hear?

22
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:35,290
Do you hear my- the clap first, or do you hit a cl- the clap after? All right, hold on.

23
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:38,649
How's that? Is that- can you still hear me? Are we good? Is that better?

24
00:05:38,649 --> 00:05:41,769
Mine's gonna be desynced, but I couldn't tell. Hold on, let me move this shit.

25
00:05:41,769 --> 00:05:55,639
Hold on, sorry, but block your ears. I'm just like grabbing onto your ears.

26
00:05:55,639 --> 00:05:58,920
So- so that's better. So this is fine? You guys ever okay with this? Let's try some

27
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:04,759
tests here. Are we synced? Why the fuck is the game behind me?

28
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:13,139
I did like the point to your monitor this way. So there's still a desync. Let me try this.

29
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:20,540
That's fucking weird. A lot of weird shit. Oh, god damn it. Of course there's a desync.

30
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:25,339
Stupid fucking- I was playing PlayStation 3 yesterday. Everything's fine now.

31
00:06:30,459 --> 00:06:34,920
Okay, so here we go. Look, I got my controllers here. I went like that.

32
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:40,199
Like I pointed this way to the monitors. Should I just recalibrate and point that way?

33
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:46,389
So I'm just gonna recalibrate. I'm just gonna point the controller this way.

34
00:06:47,029 --> 00:07:03,050
I'm gonna try that because- what the fuck? All right, let's do a room setup. What's happening?

35
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:09,670
What the hell is that on the- oh, please take off the headset and follow the- you got it.

36
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:21,110
Okay, hold on a second here guys. All right, this will only take a second. All right, turn

37
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:25,990
the controllers, place the controllers. I just- I did this like three times. Why if I point this

38
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:34,339
way at my screen- fucking valve. Locate your monitor. Okay, let me locate the monitor real

39
00:07:34,339 --> 00:07:46,009
quick. Found it. Well, I know where the floor is. I sure as hell know where that is. It's right

40
00:07:46,009 --> 00:08:00,649
here. There's the floor. Okay. Now I'm gonna measure- I'm gonna do like the- here we go.

41
00:08:00,649 --> 00:08:17,529
I did this shit like five times already. I wanted to be like prepared for the VR streams,

42
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:22,970
but you never are. They expect somebody to fucking buy this? You think like grandma's

43
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:32,980
gonna play this game? Okay, there we are. Let's go. Your minimum play area is not big enough.

44
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:45,210
I just- it was- what happened in the- is it because my monitor is over here now?

45
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:51,610
Is that the problem? My monitor changed its positions and therefore I don't have enough

46
00:08:51,610 --> 00:09:02,789
room to play? Fucking virtual reality. Give me a goddamn Super Nintendo any day of the week.

47
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:22,950
Okay. Okay, there we go. Play area has been selected. Your play area has been selected.

48
00:09:24,679 --> 00:09:33,190
Done. Setup complete. All right, here we go. I'm ready. Can you guys hear the game? All right,

49
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:49,399
here we go. How do- all right, I gotta open the game again. So what the hell is over there?

50
00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:59,929
No game, no sound. No game, no sound. There it comes. I just have to- all right. What the

51
00:09:59,929 --> 00:10:03,450
fuck is it opening? What are you opening? What are you doing? What the fuck is that?

52
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:09,690
Why is that on the screen? Why is that on the screen? I'm not even in that game!

53
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:25,320
I'm not even in this game! Give me a goddamn Super Nintendo. I'll take Donkey Kong Country 2,

54
00:10:27,029 --> 00:10:36,379
please, if you could. I don't know how many people are watching. I think we got it. Here

55
00:10:36,379 --> 00:10:56,980
it comes. Did it work? I think that's it, right? Yup. So I just want to make sure- I want

56
00:10:56,980 --> 00:11:01,220
to make sure we're really clear on this, guys. I want to make sure you're damn clear on this.

57
00:11:02,259 --> 00:11:07,610
I pointed my- please point towards your monitor. I pointed that way.

58
00:11:08,789 --> 00:11:15,799
I think we fixed it. Technology sucks. Let's go back to fucking books. All right, I'm going in.

59
00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:28,009
Yeah, the original virtual world. It's called J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings.

60
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:46,149
Are we good? I can't even drink my coffee. All right, I'm so excited for this. I really am.

61
00:11:46,149 --> 00:11:51,350
Where's my predator connection here? Which one's right and which one's left? Can I see

62
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:54,870
that through here? I can't. Why would I be able to see that? Which is the left one,

63
00:11:54,870 --> 00:12:04,470
which is the right one? I can't- where the- okay, the best part about the Steam VR shit,

64
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:15,179
and I- this is so loud. I get up- how do I adjust this? I'm only going with one. I don't

65
00:12:15,179 --> 00:12:30,330
give a fuck. Until somebody figures that- there's got to be like a drink can thing that comes

66
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:43,340
down. How are you supposed to hydrate? That's on the- uh, that's mono sound in VR.

67
00:12:45,259 --> 00:12:48,860
I can't do it, man. I'll throw up. All right, I'm getting my zone here.

68
00:12:49,659 --> 00:12:55,320
I've made it to the zone, the play area, and I'm ready to fucking go nuts. I'm gonna turn

69
00:12:55,320 --> 00:13:03,049
the game down a little. All right, I'm getting in the zone. I gotta put these down first so

70
00:13:03,049 --> 00:13:07,769
I can get as comfortable- I don't like this fucking giant cable. How much is the wireless

71
00:13:07,769 --> 00:13:19,480
thing? 300 bucks? Fuck me, I have like a giant rat tail. I have a giant rat tail

72
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:31,669
that's weighing me down. I've never even put it on. I wanted it to be blind. I adjusted.

73
00:13:32,309 --> 00:13:38,279
I put the head on, but I didn't put like the rat tail on. All right, guys, I'm fucking ready

74
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:42,840
to go. Where are my hands? I'm supposed to be able to see my hands in VR. Where are they?

75
00:13:43,879 --> 00:14:05,379
All right, let's do it! Something happened in here that I'm not, uh, gonna necessarily

76
00:14:05,379 --> 00:14:22,389
aware. Okay, I think- okay, I got it. I got it. My hands- why? You need like fucking

77
00:14:22,389 --> 00:14:27,429
four people- you gotta hire like three people to help you get into a game. All right,

78
00:14:27,429 --> 00:14:35,539
I'm ready. It's nice and snug. It looks good. No, what the fuck are you doing? I don't- no,

79
00:14:35,539 --> 00:14:48,600
don't go home! Get- what button did I just press? What, is there a button? No, don't turn the

80
00:14:48,600 --> 00:15:04,470
system off! Okay, okay, guys, welcome to my VR attempt here to try VR for the first time.

81
00:15:05,429 --> 00:15:10,070
At least in the Steam version of VR, which I've heard is quite fun and quite interesting.

82
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:14,710
We're gonna play this game called Blade and Sorcery. Came out, um, probably a couple years

83
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:17,509
ago, but I never had a chance to play it. Let's go ahead and create our character.

84
00:15:19,429 --> 00:15:24,539
It's like got this- what? Wait, why is it giving me like a little cube indicator?

85
00:15:25,259 --> 00:15:33,580
Get out of here! I know that I can't go that far. Why are you boxing me in? Stop it!

86
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:52,090
All right, we got, uh, hair. Uh, oh, you can select it. Let's go Mohawk. A beard. What

87
00:15:52,169 --> 00:15:55,529
about- what about for a beard? What do you guys think? Oh, that's right, I couldn't get that to

88
00:15:55,529 --> 00:16:11,940
work. Eye color. Uh, let's just go with like here. That's fine. Uh, I- is this game good?

89
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:16,100
Like, this is a highly requested game. I don't- I don't care what he looks like. Face.

90
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:20,500
Oh god, you're gonna do this to me right now. Why would you give me a character creator?

91
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:28,100
An elaborate character creator? That's so cool. Okay, eye size, eye rotation,

92
00:16:28,899 --> 00:17:06,170
a mouth size. Uh, is this doing anything? Okay, I gave him a Mickey Mouse nose.

93
00:17:18,259 --> 00:17:28,809
Somebody just like punched into his face. All right, you know what? Let's go with uh,

94
00:17:28,809 --> 00:17:41,539
glutes. Oh, the glutens. I just heard my computer make a loud click sound. I don't

95
00:17:41,539 --> 00:17:46,019
know if that's good or not. Am I still alive? Did my computer, did my motherboard just like

96
00:17:46,019 --> 00:17:52,819
fry? Did I just fry my motherboard? I don't know. I don't know because I can't see. Who said that?

97
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:07,799
He's got like- he's got skin colored football pads on. This is like a joke. He went to the

98
00:18:07,799 --> 00:18:24,650
party store and got this put on. Oh wait, hold on. That's too tall. You gotta be small

99
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:34,500
than that. Feet size. All right, that's good. I'm ready. All right, select this character.

100
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:42,470
I've got- is this play area too small? Am I gonna get yelled at for this every time?

101
00:18:43,269 --> 00:18:46,309
Can you guys see these bars? Can you see these bars?

102
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:56,710
I might have to like sit down in a chair and just change it. I thought I told me I had

103
00:18:56,710 --> 00:19:06,980
enough room. Select. Calibrate. Please stand up, look straight, and click calibrate to set.

104
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:25,849
It just made him- it just made him fucking this up. Okay, let's play the game. I can't

105
00:19:25,849 --> 00:19:40,700
wait. Oh my god. What the fuck? Look at you. That's never- I've never experienced something

106
00:19:40,700 --> 00:20:00,730
that fucking ridiculous before in my life. Like in my whole life. That's fucking so funny. Okay,

107
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:06,220
so I move around like- how do I move around? Did you know- I can't read any of that. I have

108
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:13,500
no idea what the fuck that says. Did you know you can sheath up to four objects? Do I

109
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:28,759
have to walk there? Okay, this is actually important because I will walk into a fucking wall.

110
00:20:28,759 --> 00:20:45,269
I will actually hurt myself, so it's good that I did this here. How do I move? I don't- how do

111
00:20:45,269 --> 00:21:09,420
I move? Oh look- okay, that's fucking weird. I'm sorry. Oh, you can jump? I don't like

112
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:18,230
doing that. It's too fast. How do I go slower? Okay, I'm starting to figure it out. Let's

113
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:24,180
see. You can sheath up to four objects and weapons on you. You can sheath up to four

114
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:31,299
objects and weapons on you by dropping them over your left or right shoulder. What? What?

115
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:41,289
So you can sheath up to four weapons by dropping them over your shoulder or on each side of your

116
00:21:41,289 --> 00:21:53,619
hips. How close am I to this wall? Okay, you can practice this by doing it by looking at

117
00:21:53,619 --> 00:21:57,220
yourself in the mirror in the home. Be aware that some objects are restricted to hips or

118
00:21:57,220 --> 00:22:08,779
back only. How do I like turn around again? Okay, there it is. All right, that kind of makes

119
00:22:08,779 --> 00:22:14,859
me want to die doing that though too often. All right, cool. So I practice with a sword.

120
00:22:15,579 --> 00:22:25,349
How do I grab it? How do I get the sword? Sword, yeah. I want to grab it with like

121
00:22:25,349 --> 00:22:53,779
what- which button? Okay. Can I hold it with two hands? Come on, use my force powers.

122
00:22:57,509 --> 00:23:29,000
Ah, this is the coolest thing I've ever done in my life. I'm gonna hit the fucking wall.

123
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:49,400
I'm gonna get like a good stance here. I'm having more fun just doing this than anything

124
00:23:49,400 --> 00:24:38,869
else. All right, come to me. How do I get it to pull over here? It's not gonna work.

125
00:24:38,869 --> 00:24:57,029
All right, get it. Where'd it go? All right, how do I play? Let's go. So I can check it

126
00:24:57,029 --> 00:25:01,829
right. It's right. It's the right one. So it's this one. There it is. Okay, cool.

127
00:25:04,579 --> 00:25:07,619
I love this so much. I don't know what to do. Let's go over here. Let's take a look at

128
00:25:07,779 --> 00:25:24,759
the books. What's that? What's that monster? There's a monster back here. Oh, it's okay.

129
00:25:24,759 --> 00:25:55,190
It's a pottery thing. What the fuck is this? Oh, shit. I have to try to put it back in.

130
00:25:59,779 --> 00:26:15,079
Get in there. This one. What the fuck? I'm pressing it, aren't I? It's right. It's right.

131
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:26,680
Sit on there. Come here. In. To the holster. Okay. My goodness. Is there a mission?

132
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:54,390
All right. Where am I in my room? Where am I? I'm looking to hit something.

133
00:26:54,390 --> 00:27:19,859
Okay, that's not a real table. What's this one do? The market. Yeah, let's go. Let's

134
00:27:19,859 --> 00:27:30,519
go to the market. Unknown location. Okay. What's that one? The arena. Wait, there's

135
00:27:30,519 --> 00:27:43,019
a book over there. No one's ever gonna be able to do this. Choose destination on the

136
00:27:43,019 --> 00:27:53,259
map to travel. Isn't that what I just did? The ruins. Oh, okay. These ruins have been

137
00:27:53,259 --> 00:27:58,779
known to protect a mysterious cult practicing dark magic and human sacrifice. Make them pay

138
00:27:58,779 --> 00:28:17,859
for their crimes. Am I facing the right way? I'm so disoriented. I'm ready. I have to,

139
00:28:17,859 --> 00:28:37,190
like, move, otherwise it feels weird standing doing this. Is it gonna kill me if I let it

140
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:44,940
go? No, that's fine. All right, well, we don't need that right now. This is probably

141
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:49,829
a puzzle that I'm gonna have to do later. Can I just, like, can I just hit shit?

142
00:28:50,470 --> 00:29:04,150
What's the distance? Right, like, here. This is the most fun thing I've ever done. I'm serious.

143
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:09,829
I'm serious. This is the funnest thing I've ever done in my whole life. I've been to Disney

144
00:29:09,829 --> 00:29:19,960
World. I've rode roller coasters before. I've had teeth pulled. Uh, very easy. Wave one.

145
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:38,170
Uh, what's it gonna do? What? Here, put this away for a second. Okay. Oh, all right,

146
00:29:38,170 --> 00:29:42,809
we got very easy. I just, I needed to know how to play the game. Start it. Fight in

147
00:29:42,809 --> 00:30:34,779
progress. Oh, God. Oh, my God. Oh, I just hit my hand. Gotta make sure he's dead.

148
00:30:34,779 --> 00:31:18,200
I'm gonna two-hand this. Ow! I went the wrong way. Oh, I dropped it! I blocked it.

149
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:22,420
Which way is he coming? Which way is he gonna go, huh? Which way is he gonna go?

150
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:58,069
Oh! What do you got? Give me a weapon. What do you got? What is this, stick?

151
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:29,769
Come with me, like, always. That works. Holy shit, why am I flying?

152
00:32:29,769 --> 00:32:55,559
We got another one? Two more? Get in the low center of gravity. This fucking room

153
00:32:55,559 --> 00:33:18,819
scale. My earbuds fell out. How do I pause the game? How do I pause VR? I don't have

154
00:33:18,819 --> 00:34:05,589
any sound. Cut him in half! Ow! I'm gonna lie on my fucking, like,

155
00:34:05,589 --> 00:34:17,610
resume here. I'm gonna lie on my SATs. That was fun. Where the fuck am I?

156
00:34:17,610 --> 00:34:21,210
Uh, I'm gonna redo the room scale calibration and, like, pretend the room is bigger.

157
00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:43,639
Need some coffee after that one. I put on the straps. Oh, yeah, I forgot.

158
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:48,260
I forgot I gotta put the straps on. All right, is the room scale thing annoying,

159
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:51,619
or is it, is that, okay, is that, like, not irritating to look at?

160
00:34:51,619 --> 00:34:55,030
Because, like, I could just fake it. I'm not gonna hit the fucking wall.

161
00:34:55,030 --> 00:35:05,130
All right, that's on. It's fine, it's fine. Okay. All right, just making sure it's not,

162
00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:12,219
like, annoying to see. Move your arms in a walking motion to move instead.

163
00:35:13,099 --> 00:35:20,389
Really? You can make it feel less intrusive in the settings, really.

164
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:26,940
Just like the Steam, like, VR settings? Hold on, let me just, like, see.

165
00:35:27,659 --> 00:35:33,030
It's, like, crushing my eye. So, let me see here. I got the Steam VR right here.

166
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:45,400
Settings. Put this up. Uh, night mode, locked mode, DND,

167
00:35:49,659 --> 00:35:54,619
suppress warnings and alerts when Steam's VR status is minimized. It's in the VR setting.

168
00:35:54,619 --> 00:35:59,619
Yeah, I'm in the VR settings right now. That was so much fucking fun.

169
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:12,070
No, with your headset on. It's the settings while in VR. Oh, okay.

170
00:36:12,869 --> 00:36:19,699
So, do I have to, like, go, like, is there a way I can get to, like, the Steam, like,

171
00:36:19,699 --> 00:36:29,289
the VR menu? It's the bottom button. Oh, it is. So, it's this button on the side of the headset.

172
00:36:29,289 --> 00:36:36,710
It's the thing that I pressed before. Whoa. I got to recalibrate. Recalibrate.

173
00:36:45,690 --> 00:36:54,070
And then it's the settings in here. What the fuck is this button?

174
00:36:54,070 --> 00:36:57,110
I pressed it accidentally before, and now I can't, like, find the damn thing.

175
00:36:57,909 --> 00:37:13,670
There it is. Okay. So, settings, right? Stream. Okay. Night mode. Do not disturb.

176
00:37:14,469 --> 00:37:22,139
It's the chaperone. Chaperone bounds. Opacity. Bring it down. Okay, that's better.

177
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:32,440
All right, that's cool. Intermediate. What's that mean? All right. Squares. Advanced.

178
00:37:34,579 --> 00:37:40,579
Developer. Developer. Oh, okay. So, that, that did make some go away completely. I don't know

179
00:37:40,579 --> 00:37:43,300
if I want to do that because that's, like, actually probably dangerous. I'm going to get

180
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:47,139
hurt. But maybe I don't give a fuck. We'll see. We'll see how annoying it is.

181
00:37:51,739 --> 00:37:57,429
All right. Let's keep going. I'm going to put both headphones in so he can't hear us. You know

182
00:37:57,429 --> 00:38:07,619
what I mean? He can't hear us. I'm so sweaty already. Yeah, that's much better. All right.

183
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:14,630
So, I need to, like, how do I, like, recalibrate this? This is not right. At all.

184
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:45,750
I might have to back to app. What did I do fucking wrong?

185
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:57,829
Click window on desktop. Holy fuck. All right. We're good. All right. Let's get back in one more

186
00:38:57,829 --> 00:39:00,630
sip of coffee and we're going to do the next, we're going to do a harder wave, I think.

187
00:39:09,639 --> 00:39:19,429
Let me get my fucking headphones back in. I'm so glad somebody actually made this game.

188
00:39:22,519 --> 00:39:33,239
No, stop doing that. Respell. Respell. Respell. Respell. Respell.

189
00:39:34,489 --> 00:39:42,869
I don't know what spell I did. Okay. Let's get this back on. All right. Let's go. Respell.

190
00:39:45,619 --> 00:39:53,659
Okay. There's my sword, right? All right. Let's get this foot back where I wanted it.

191
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:58,579
Turn around here. They had some cool weapons though. Let me see what they had.

192
00:39:59,139 --> 00:40:18,659
Some kind of stick. Seems pretty good. I don't know if it's that good though.

193
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:31,159
Doesn't even break any bones. This sucks. Give me my, no, here we go. Here's a new weapon,

194
00:40:31,159 --> 00:40:37,429
right? Is this the same sword that I had before or is this different?

195
00:40:38,070 --> 00:40:55,099
Like, hold on a minute here, fellas. All right. Who wants some pork? I'm ready for the next wave.

196
00:40:55,099 --> 00:41:06,949
Fight ended. Okay. Return. Where's like the food game where you can like,

197
00:41:06,949 --> 00:41:11,159
I just want to get like, I don't care about, is there a game with an onion?

198
00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:15,590
Is there an onion in this game or in any VR game where I get an onion and just be like,

199
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:26,409
and the fuck, I'll just like slide it into the pot. All right. We'll do wave two.

200
00:41:26,969 --> 00:41:40,019
There you go. This guy's got, jump over the rock. That would have been cool.

201
00:41:40,659 --> 00:41:54,360
Just wait till he swims and then come in with a double. Just treat him like an onion.

202
00:41:55,000 --> 00:42:11,659
I gotta get, what's on me? What the, why did I become the rock? Hello? What?

203
00:42:16,789 --> 00:42:32,380
Give me that sword back. Where the fuck is hitting me?

204
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:54,260
You want to get the fucking chef? Eat this, you fucking celery bitch.

205
00:42:54,260 --> 00:43:25,780
I'm wild. I'm like a caged fucking beast. I got both of you. Oh, would that hurt your hand? I'm sorry, ma'am.

206
00:43:42,739 --> 00:43:51,590
Wait, how do I do anything? Can I grab? What? Oh my God. This is fucking a blast.

207
00:43:52,150 --> 00:44:01,980
I'm losing my mind. I don't even, I don't even have my twitch dashboard on.

208
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:07,219
Sweat check. It's always going to get bad here in about like 20 minutes.

209
00:44:08,969 --> 00:44:20,139
You can throw weapons? How do I throw a weapon? Hold trigger while using telekinesis. Okay.

210
00:44:26,070 --> 00:44:31,849
Relevant controller. Drink water. Don't drink coffee. I got plenty of fucking hydration

211
00:44:31,849 --> 00:44:41,260
room back off. How do I have like hair in my mouth? No, stop it. All right, steam. I'm

212
00:44:41,260 --> 00:44:44,860
going to give you a fucking design choice here that I would change if I were you.

213
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:51,639
Don't have the button be here. Have the button be like up here somewhere. Like up here.

214
00:44:51,639 --> 00:44:59,159
Because like everybody like puts it on like this. Or at least I do. So change it for me.

215
00:44:59,159 --> 00:45:07,449
Okay, let's keep going. That was fucking I love this game. So let me get this straight.

216
00:45:08,090 --> 00:45:26,539
Can I like throw a weapon if I like let go of this? That didn't really work. So but like this

217
00:45:30,059 --> 00:45:36,380
with the force power, just kind of when I hit trigger, it kind of comes back to me.

218
00:45:40,789 --> 00:45:45,769
So if I hold trigger and then do it, hold trigger and like I'm holding them both at the

219
00:45:45,769 --> 00:45:56,300
same time. That was fucking cool. Hold and release when you throw it. No, that's what

220
00:45:56,300 --> 00:46:08,300
I was doing. So I was holding the trigger down and then letting go. Not the trigger.

221
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:16,420
It's like this grip button. That's how you pull it up, right? Now I do have like spells

222
00:46:16,420 --> 00:46:24,010
too. I gotta hold on. Let me do some like fucking fun tinkering here. So walk over here.

223
00:46:24,809 --> 00:46:31,130
I got it forced right now. So if I hold the grip button down, there we go. Okay. So it's

224
00:46:31,130 --> 00:46:36,010
the grip button. It's not the trigger button. Cool. Let me just play around. I got spells too,

225
00:46:36,010 --> 00:46:47,030
apparently. So how do I do a spell? Okay, holding that jumps. This is walk. What is spells?

226
00:46:48,619 --> 00:46:55,909
That's the other grip. I had it up there before, didn't I? Maybe it's like the trigger and grip.

227
00:46:57,670 --> 00:47:08,329
Hmm. I didn't know that existed. What about down? Does down do anything on the,

228
00:47:09,210 --> 00:47:17,980
okay, doesn't hurt me. Just wanted to make sure. Let's get that wave going again.

229
00:47:18,940 --> 00:47:26,179
Oh, is it a spear? Hold on. I gotta, oh, come on. Let me, of course I can use the spear. Put this

230
00:47:26,179 --> 00:47:40,059
back. And it's a spear and a shield. Thank you very much. Oh, this is, okay, now this is what,

231
00:47:40,059 --> 00:47:46,179
this is fucking awesome. I can just be a fucking turtle dickhead and just be like this.

232
00:47:47,059 --> 00:47:51,300
You know what I mean? I could be like the, what's the, what's the famous group of actors

233
00:47:51,300 --> 00:48:01,590
that like took on the, took on the, the Persian, the Spartans. All right, I'm gonna do, I want

234
00:48:01,590 --> 00:48:12,070
to do Spartan. Let's start it. I'm just gonna, I'm gonna, this is gonna be great.

235
00:48:16,119 --> 00:48:24,739
Jesus. Use touch pad or thumb pad to stick, to scroll up or down. Use, select a wave again.

236
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:37,860
Okay, let's go. And let them know that 300 Spartans.

237
00:48:41,820 --> 00:48:56,539
That's right. That's what you do. Remember they make the big wall right in his neck.

238
00:49:03,989 --> 00:49:41,400
Get out of my town. They could give me like fucking 50 people,

239
00:49:41,400 --> 00:50:28,139
doesn't even matter. And it's starting to hurt my back. Get out of here. Get off of me.

240
00:50:28,139 --> 00:50:49,130
Oh, you want to play that way? Come on. Come on. Damn it. Oh, sorry. That was

241
00:50:49,130 --> 00:51:24,340
dishonorable. I think I got him. What's going on? All right, let's go. I like this setup. Wave three

242
00:51:24,340 --> 00:51:47,980
on very easy. Begin. All right, guy up top. My hands are covered in water. Oh, you get the same

243
00:51:47,980 --> 00:52:06,090
strategy, but you didn't protect your legs. You didn't think I was gonna saw them. She's not

244
00:52:06,090 --> 00:52:35,079
dead. Told you. Told you. Sorry, I'm being like silent. I have to. What the hell? How did

245
00:52:35,079 --> 00:53:03,739
you get behind me? Oh, you got my eye like a movie. Oops. Something's in my eye. How?

246
00:53:04,219 --> 00:53:12,889
Did like a piece of glass go in my eye? I just gotta get close enough to do like the sweep.

247
00:53:16,260 --> 00:53:27,159
Now die. Oh, who's hitting me? I don't know. I don't know who is just hitting me.

248
00:53:28,679 --> 00:54:03,019
How do I do the health potion? Oh shit. I need a different weapon. Where's my dagger?

249
00:54:03,019 --> 00:54:21,670
Where's my dagger? I can fucking do that to me now, are you? Never fuck with a guy with

250
00:54:21,670 --> 00:54:52,579
a spear. Just like Captain America. Let me get this straight. So can I like, I want to hold

251
00:54:52,579 --> 00:55:04,230
this from a different angle. I'm letting it go. Holy shit. I got to do that to somebody.

252
00:55:04,230 --> 00:55:27,610
This is like, oh, this is going right through somebody's head. This is definitely, oh,

253
00:55:27,610 --> 00:55:32,309
this is so worth it. If you haven't played VR and you don't, and you figure about getting

254
00:55:32,309 --> 00:55:39,099
a vibe, this game is $20, I think. Holy shit. All right. I need to get some like

255
00:55:39,099 --> 00:55:47,500
backup weapons. I need to figure out how to do spells. All right. Can you come up for a second?

256
00:55:48,139 --> 00:55:59,539
How much is the vibe? It's $4.99. And there are better games for free. I'm just getting a taste.

257
00:56:00,099 --> 00:56:09,719
You know, I'm just getting a sample. Four dollars and 99 cents and all.

258
00:56:10,360 --> 00:56:19,190
So I click in the touchpad. I was clicking the touchpad on the right or the left.

259
00:56:25,269 --> 00:56:31,940
The telekinesis is going too fast. Is there like a menu I can look at?

260
00:56:37,530 --> 00:56:43,340
You can grab people. Just pause and go to help. Yeah, I'll just look at it. No.

261
00:56:44,059 --> 00:56:52,019
Let's see what we got here. I mean, is there? Oh, God. It's so hard to get back in once you're

262
00:56:52,019 --> 00:56:59,610
out. I'm going to look like a fucking psycho, but am I going to move my hair? Holy. Let's take

263
00:56:59,610 --> 00:57:11,239
a look. I just broke out of a coffin. You know what I mean? I'm not supposed to be

264
00:57:11,239 --> 00:57:17,639
alive right now. I just broke out of a, they buried me like two weeks ago and I got out.

265
00:57:17,639 --> 00:57:23,659
I wasn't supposed to be in there. I was still alive. Oh, there's like already like

266
00:57:23,659 --> 00:57:31,139
grease on this thing. Fuck me. I can't hold it. Don't look my shirt up. I've already got like

267
00:57:31,139 --> 00:57:45,539
face grease on here. I should have just got like a, like a buzz cut. Oh, I'm going to be

268
00:57:45,539 --> 00:57:54,099
losing hair in front of this head. You bet you I will. All right. Let me try to get back in

269
00:57:54,099 --> 00:58:08,010
here. Is there like a, like a wet wipe I can get for the vibe? There's got to be like

270
00:58:08,329 --> 00:58:20,760
specific wet wipes, right? Somebody's going to make them. All right. Something's not right

271
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:37,260
here. It's going to go back around. All right. That's good. Okay. All right. Let's go take a

272
00:58:37,260 --> 00:58:47,260
look at some stuff here. Back it up. So on this table, there's a health potion here.

273
00:58:47,900 --> 00:59:31,829
That was delicious. Wait, I'm going dinner, man. Let's go. I'm going to do another one.

274
00:59:31,829 --> 00:59:37,079
I'm just like drunk shit face guy at the bar. All right. Now we're going to go to

275
00:59:38,389 --> 00:59:46,119
wave three is this one. So let's do this medium. Let's do, let's do like wave.

276
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:57,179
Let's just do wave three. Let's just try it. Wave two. All right. Let's see if I

277
00:59:57,179 --> 01:00:04,739
can't fucking do something cool here. Didn't somebody say if I move my hands, I walk.

278
01:00:04,739 --> 01:00:44,650
Oh, come on. What was I doing? I was grabbing him by the shoulder.

279
01:00:54,300 --> 01:01:07,369
I just like did something there. It looks like when my hands were grasped.

280
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:14,019
Okay. So when you crass, okay, I got it. Lightning. So they went, okay.

281
01:01:14,019 --> 01:01:28,059
So that's fucking loud. So I have lightning on my hand right now.

282
01:01:29,579 --> 01:01:32,780
Is that, is that so loud that you can't even fucking hear it might be

283
01:01:35,699 --> 01:02:00,230
I'm going to have to lower the fucking volume. Okay. I need a team of actors to help me.

284
01:02:00,949 --> 01:02:12,699
I must just fucking tripped. All right. Let's try the wiping. So it's

285
01:02:13,659 --> 01:02:17,659
grab, let go. So I only have, I have no spell here. So I have this one selected.

286
01:02:20,920 --> 01:02:22,199
So let's just try it.

287
01:02:30,920 --> 01:02:58,280
Give me that weapon. Oh my God. That's too much for me to handle.

288
01:03:16,550 --> 01:03:28,949
Come on. Murderer. I got to do Diablo two style necromancer.

289
01:03:58,460 --> 01:04:55,880
Oh my God. That was horrible. Don't let him do it. Do it. It's life or death. Which one?

290
01:04:55,880 --> 01:05:27,030
Which one am I going? Give me the potion. No, don't give him the potion. I'm like handing it to them.

291
01:05:27,030 --> 01:05:56,119
You idiot. You fucked it all up. No, that was pretty dramatic. I know. Grab. Yeah. I got to

292
01:05:56,119 --> 01:06:01,929
get used to the controllers because it's kind of hard to. So for instance, when you like

293
01:06:01,929 --> 01:06:06,489
grab, like when I press these buttons here, it's like, and you kind of have to tilt your

294
01:06:06,489 --> 01:06:10,760
wrist a little because I can't really do it with my pinky. It's like, it's hard to,

295
01:06:10,760 --> 01:06:20,059
I got to get used to the Vive controller. So I'm going to put, I'm going to, I'm going to

296
01:06:20,059 --> 01:06:32,539
un-stop that potion. My back is like fucked up now. I've had like back problems for a while

297
01:06:32,539 --> 01:06:35,739
and I have no idea what the fuck is wrong with me. All right. You stick in there.

298
01:06:40,230 --> 01:06:48,440
You just stay un-stopped from my drink later. Let's get this out of my person here. Okay.

299
01:06:48,440 --> 01:07:00,519
I got two daggers. Oh, let's get, okay. Let's try that again. Yeah. This time I'm going

300
01:07:00,519 --> 01:07:13,719
to try to just work with this here. So bingo. That's so fucking awesome. I need to like

301
01:07:13,719 --> 01:07:21,159
utilize, I got to start this and get up here. Is there, somebody has a bow. I have to crush

302
01:07:21,159 --> 01:07:37,210
everybody's head with a brick. Let me just take a look. The axe. I like that. I don't

303
01:07:37,210 --> 01:07:40,570
think I, I don't think I picked it up. All right. I like this one. This one's pretty

304
01:07:40,570 --> 01:07:56,139
fucked up. Cool. All right. I guess that, okay. Yeah. Let's replace this. Okay. Just

305
01:07:56,139 --> 01:08:08,619
make sure it works. Okay. Any more items that I need to be made aware of? Let's take a look

306
01:08:08,619 --> 01:08:21,720
up top. That's so interesting. Cool. Uh, that, that over there, it looks like it could be

307
01:08:21,720 --> 01:08:26,439
used. What are these bad, these oil barrels? Oh, fuck this. Just keep it here. I'm going

308
01:08:26,439 --> 01:08:30,279
to be throwing these at people. Oh my God. This is perfect. Why wouldn't I come up here

309
01:08:30,279 --> 01:08:39,930
before? Is it fall damage? All right. I'm going to go for like the throw shit if people

310
01:08:39,930 --> 01:08:46,460
take me. I'm going to bring a potion with me up there. This one. Don't steal that.

311
01:08:48,010 --> 01:08:56,180
What the hell? Why? Who's hitting me? Why? Who are you here? What? Ah, okay. Wave

312
01:08:56,260 --> 01:09:19,539
three. Wait. Three stars. All right. Go. Get ready. All right. Get out of my way. What the

313
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:53,640
Is it my blood? That person. Get back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back it up.

314
01:09:53,640 --> 01:10:51,430
Back it up. Give me that bow. Come here. Grab. No. What? Really? Really? There it is.

315
01:10:51,430 --> 01:10:58,420
I got it. I'm taking people out. I'm fucking going to be like the Star Wars kid. Just you

316
01:10:58,420 --> 01:11:34,329
wait and see. Fuck potions. We don't even need them. Stop letting go of it.

317
01:11:50,390 --> 01:12:00,630
Come here. Get over here. Get the fuck over here then. Get over here then. What? What item

318
01:12:00,630 --> 01:12:05,819
is this? Get off. Close the book. I'm creating a book in the middle of a fight.

319
01:12:17,939 --> 01:12:48,500
How could we get that on the right track? No, it's spilling. What is it? Electricity.

320
01:12:50,390 --> 01:13:10,359
I was like, am I standing in a puddle? Get off my sword. Damn it. This is fucking so much fun.

321
01:13:13,380 --> 01:13:34,180
I thought, I was like, what am I standing in electricity? Absolute psycho. What? I'm fighting

322
01:13:34,180 --> 01:13:41,300
for my life. I'm fighting for my life here. All right. I had a better tactic when I had this

323
01:13:41,300 --> 01:13:50,340
shield and the spear. I'm actually, we're going to go easy. Like really, really easy

324
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:58,539
because God, I haven't even like grabbed the tip of the iceberg. Have I? This, this is fucking,

325
01:13:58,539 --> 01:14:04,699
this is so much fun. What a broken record I am tonight about that. But my God, this is so much

326
01:14:04,699 --> 01:14:12,460
different than the PSVR. It's like unbelievable. Has my stomach look fat? I mean, like not like

327
01:14:12,460 --> 01:14:18,949
in the game, but me, it probably does. I want to try. I want to try just simply.

328
01:14:19,750 --> 01:14:25,479
So I want to just grab this person. I'm just going to try to learn it.

329
01:14:27,529 --> 01:14:39,029
So we got, okay, you're here. Can I like grab? So can I, okay, hold? Is it, okay, can you hold

330
01:14:39,029 --> 01:14:45,210
this button? Do I actually have to hold it though? Yeah, you do. I gotta hold down the grip

331
01:14:45,930 --> 01:15:36,060
and then, so you can do that. I can't, how do I do this? What? This is too, like what?

332
01:15:36,859 --> 01:15:41,579
This is not how, this is not all right. It's not all right to like, let kids do this.

333
01:15:42,380 --> 01:16:10,739
All right, I got it. You got to hold the grips down.

334
01:16:12,979 --> 01:16:19,239
That was daunting. Look who I have. I have one of your comrades. All right, let's try that

335
01:16:19,239 --> 01:16:27,239
again. I almost just fell backwards. Not because I'm like winded, but because I almost just fell

336
01:16:27,239 --> 01:16:33,130
over because I'm moving around too much. All right, let's go back to my, my bread and butter.

337
01:16:34,380 --> 01:17:08,119
I have to, really, the fucking objects just hurt. Ow, my face. Okay, that one's good. Okay,

338
01:17:08,119 --> 01:17:24,840
that one's good. Wait a minute, can you? Can you? Can you? Really? I can't like drink that out of

339
01:17:24,840 --> 01:17:56,949
the mug. Oh, that feels like, just that alone. Put that away. What's in here? I gotta hit

340
01:17:56,949 --> 01:18:13,779
somebody in the fucking heaven chair. Like that's, yeah, I mean, where is it? I can't see it.

341
01:18:15,449 --> 01:18:51,960
It's under the table. Okay, with me. Who will it be? Oh, hello, man.

342
01:19:03,640 --> 01:19:12,619
Damn it. What? Did I catch the arrow? I think I just caught the arrow in the air.

343
01:19:22,359 --> 01:19:25,479
It's too much fun to just experiment. All right, I'm going, I'm going for the real deal

344
01:19:26,920 --> 01:19:31,159
I caught the fucking arrow out of the air. All right, give me my, give me my shit.

345
01:19:35,029 --> 01:19:46,899
There it is. Let's do it. This is what I had the most success

346
01:19:47,699 --> 01:19:54,500
with my setup with the protection and complete offense. My always on offense.

347
01:19:55,460 --> 01:20:30,789
Let's go. They like, okay. Get out of here. Where the fuck did you come from? What?

348
01:20:31,750 --> 01:21:34,470
You picked a bad place to spawn. Shoot it. Oh, I got it. Come on.

349
01:21:49,050 --> 01:22:17,739
Pick up the dagger. Going up top. I'm like, I'm getting close to the wall. I gotta be careful.

350
01:22:43,260 --> 01:23:18,119
I need that bow. Give me that bow. Come here. Come here. Does nobody have anything? What?

351
01:23:18,520 --> 01:23:38,939
I'm stuck. I got, I'm wrapped up. I'm stuck. It's actually wrapped around my whole leg.

352
01:24:39,270 --> 01:24:46,550
He put a target up for me and I hit it with extreme precision. All right. I gotta,

353
01:24:46,550 --> 01:24:50,229
I gotta hold on a second here. This is on my leg. I can't, I don't know if I can show you

354
01:24:50,229 --> 01:24:55,140
this. Can you guys see this? No, you can't. It's wrapped around. It's like a snake around

355
01:24:55,140 --> 01:25:00,390
my leg. How the fuck am I going to get out of here? I have to just turn this way.

356
01:25:02,140 --> 01:25:15,619
Whoa. Is it helping? Okay. I think that's better. That's good. Let's get it out of the way now.

357
01:25:15,619 --> 01:25:21,430
The bow and arrow is fucking fun. Let me just come out for a minute.

358
01:25:26,819 --> 01:25:37,289
Push the menu button for slo-mo. There's a slow motion button. Nice shirt. It's coming

359
01:25:37,289 --> 01:25:47,699
through the shirt. Okay. So let me tell you a few things, right? A couple of,

360
01:25:47,699 --> 01:25:51,770
a couple of important things. You know when like they have the VR set up

361
01:25:53,399 --> 01:25:56,520
at the convention and they're like, Hey man, you want to check out the VR?

362
01:25:57,500 --> 01:26:03,829
It's only gonna take like 20 minutes. Like, yeah, yeah, sure. No, that's why I always decline

363
01:26:03,829 --> 01:26:09,590
because I end up like this and I have to go home. I gotta go back to the hotel after like being

364
01:26:09,590 --> 01:26:25,909
in there for like 40 minutes. Check the face. All right. Hold on. Let me go, let me go grab

365
01:26:25,909 --> 01:26:31,609
like some water. I've been in here for an hour and a half. Holy fuck. All right. Let's

366
01:26:31,609 --> 01:26:42,340
check. I'm going to do like one or two more of these and we'll go on to the next thing.

367
01:26:43,750 --> 01:26:51,819
What is on my face? You look like a homeless guy. I need to go look in the mirror and see how

368
01:26:51,819 --> 01:27:08,359
fucking bad this looks. All right. Give me a sec. What is on my, what is on my face?

369
01:27:19,800 --> 01:27:32,260
Why is it coming off on me? Is this poisonous? This is, this is from the fucking what?

370
01:27:32,260 --> 01:27:42,859
Do I have an acid sweat? Oh my God. This is from the foam here. It's from the foam

371
01:27:42,859 --> 01:28:06,279
in the visor. What? Are you fucking serious? Okay. Well, I look fucked up. I look like,

372
01:28:06,279 --> 01:28:12,840
I look like the forward in a hockey game. I'm just like, oh yeah, let me take the break.

373
01:28:12,840 --> 01:28:18,229
I just got thrown out of the hockey game for fighting. I just beat the shit. We just got the

374
01:28:18,229 --> 01:28:20,789
shit kicked out of each other. Me and whoever else it was that was in the hockey game.

375
01:28:22,390 --> 01:28:25,350
Oh my God. All right. Give me a second. I gotta like fucking clean my face up and

376
01:28:25,350 --> 01:32:24,119
figure out why the fuck that's happening. All right. I'll be right back. All right.

377
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:39,640
It smells like Pop-Tarts in here. I don't know why. What is going on? Okay. I need to figure out

378
01:32:39,640 --> 01:32:51,300
why the fuck this is happening. So I've wiped it off, but look, right? So I got a paper

379
01:32:51,300 --> 01:33:07,560
towel here. Clean paper towel. It's like I'm doing a magic trick. What the fuck is,

380
01:33:07,560 --> 01:33:21,560
why is it doing this? Is it just, is it, is that because it's a brand new or I mean like

381
01:33:21,560 --> 01:33:31,289
that is very clearly like a bunch of shit coming off. I mean, I'm sweating in there,

382
01:33:31,289 --> 01:33:40,949
like not like crazy. I mean, like maybe I am. Did I get like a defective model?

383
01:33:41,510 --> 01:33:45,619
Of course. I always get the fucking like defective one. That's weird.

384
01:33:50,310 --> 01:34:03,109
Did I do something wrong? That happened with mine too. Oh, okay. Well, okay. I've said,

385
01:34:04,539 --> 01:34:07,899
there's like a, I swear to God, there was like another piece. It's going to keep

386
01:34:07,899 --> 01:34:16,600
doing that to me. Did you put on the gamer socks? Get it. Hold on a minute.

387
01:34:17,239 --> 01:34:20,859
How hard is this going to be like to put on? I think I already have one.

388
01:34:21,420 --> 01:34:25,979
I think it comes with like another like thing to put on. But isn't this just,

389
01:34:25,979 --> 01:34:28,699
isn't this just like a replacement? Hold on. Is this, do I need to put this on?

390
01:34:41,479 --> 01:34:48,229
No, no. This is if you have, this is, this is for a narrow face. This is the same

391
01:34:48,229 --> 01:34:55,449
material. No, it's the same thing. Well, whatever. All right. Let's see. I'm just

392
01:34:55,449 --> 01:35:02,840
going to have to like get it. Somebody said it looked like I got out of the chimney.

393
01:35:02,840 --> 01:35:06,680
All right. I got my, I had my water and take the last little bit of coffee in here. We're

394
01:35:06,680 --> 01:35:10,359
going to do this one more time. I'm going to try to kill somebody with a rock.

395
01:35:11,880 --> 01:35:15,159
I really want to kill someone with a rock. So I'm going to try. And then we're going

396
01:35:15,159 --> 01:35:25,420
to move on to probably Beat Saber. Either Beat Saber or there's like, there's like,

397
01:35:25,420 --> 01:35:29,779
I got like three things lined up for tonight. Each one will be about like,

398
01:35:29,859 --> 01:35:33,300
maybe like an hour or two each. Because like I told you guys before, after like three,

399
01:35:33,300 --> 01:35:37,689
four hours in this thing, I got to go like take a bath. You see it in real time. I'm

400
01:35:37,689 --> 01:35:46,250
going to be horrible looking in like another hour or two. All right. Let's get back in.

401
01:35:46,890 --> 01:35:54,890
Although make sure, cause I, is that in the right spot? Because I had to move. No,

402
01:35:54,890 --> 01:36:00,250
I think it's good. I literally can't, I can't leave this room and have to move the

403
01:36:00,250 --> 01:36:05,020
lighthouse to get out of the room. I'm pissed off and like annoyed that I have to

404
01:36:05,020 --> 01:36:13,420
get this like warped, like paint shit on whatever it is. Like the smears, whatever.

405
01:36:13,420 --> 01:36:18,920
As long as it doesn't get my hair, which it definitely will. Let me get this untangled.

406
01:36:22,199 --> 01:36:36,680
This is so tangled. I must've spun around so many times here, but wait down here too.

407
01:36:36,680 --> 01:36:49,130
God, I got to like step on this and twist it. One second. Sorry. Oh my ass. I can't,

408
01:36:49,130 --> 01:36:57,640
I'm so glad that this is a waste up scenario here. Where, where levels are like,

409
01:36:57,640 --> 01:37:07,500
I could get in trouble if this was like a waste down camp. It's like so sweaty and awful.

410
01:37:13,779 --> 01:37:25,220
Not that, not that way. All right. This should be a little more full. All right. That's good.

411
01:37:25,220 --> 01:37:28,659
Make sure I can move it out. I can. All right. Let's get back in. I'm ready to do,

412
01:37:28,659 --> 01:37:36,630
I've got the bow and arrow. I'm going to have some interesting fun. All right.

413
01:37:37,430 --> 01:37:44,949
Uh, all the levels are good. I'm good. Let's go. Spin this back around. Make sure I'm facing

414
01:37:44,949 --> 01:38:08,439
the right way. Oh, hold on. There's so much water in here. Okay. I need to get something

415
01:38:09,500 --> 01:38:16,739
to help clean this shit up. All right. Is this taking screenshots? Why does it keep doing that?

416
01:38:24,489 --> 01:38:56,489
All right. Let's go. Audio, audio right here. I don't know which one is which,

417
01:38:56,489 --> 01:39:12,659
which is the right and which is the left. All right, let's go. I got the, where's my bow and

418
01:39:12,659 --> 01:39:35,590
arrow? Where's my, where's my bow? Wasn't there like a market? What? Is it a quiver? Give me

419
01:39:35,590 --> 01:40:04,199
those arrows. Okay. What happened to my bow? I have a sword back here now. Am I missing

420
01:40:04,199 --> 01:40:17,060
something here? Where'd my cool bow go? I haven't even done any environmental stuff.

421
01:40:18,140 --> 01:40:46,630
Why is it all the way over here? Hello? Why is it in the ground? Whatever. It's not like

422
01:40:46,630 --> 01:40:50,470
a fucking stick in the ground. That's great. Here, you know what? Couldn't take these then.

423
01:40:50,470 --> 01:40:55,880
I'll just throw these at people. Fight ended. All right. Uh, I can scroll down.

424
01:40:56,600 --> 01:41:05,939
How do I do that again? Right. Uh, that was a lot of money. Somebody just gave a lot of money.

425
01:41:10,010 --> 01:41:15,750
I can't, I don't even know what it was. Uh, it was Freudian, Freudian weapon. Don't mind me

426
01:41:15,750 --> 01:41:21,909
just derailing your stream. Ha ha ha. I saw it. Got it. Freudian weapon. Thank you so

427
01:41:21,909 --> 01:41:28,710
much for the $50 and the derail special endless. No, thank you so much. I don't know

428
01:41:28,710 --> 01:41:37,189
where you are, but thank, I think you're, uh, you should be like here. Thank you so much

429
01:41:37,189 --> 01:41:44,149
Freudian weapon for the $50 fucking dollars. All right. We've got one V1 classic. There's a few

430
01:41:44,149 --> 01:41:52,680
more things to try here. Enemies. Let me just do group one. What is this? Multiple enemies,

431
01:41:52,680 --> 01:42:00,149
but only moan melee attack at a time. Cult versus bandits. Random cult enemies against

432
01:42:00,229 --> 01:42:13,960
bandits. Am I just like the priest that sit here and watches the melee? Why is that guy

433
01:42:13,960 --> 01:42:19,539
naked? We're supposed to be fighting each other. Why are you attacking the priest?

434
01:42:20,340 --> 01:43:03,800
All right. Well, that's my friend. Okay. But that's how that works. My face is really itchy.

435
01:43:03,800 --> 01:43:10,680
This fucking coal is on my face and it's itching my face and I can't scratch it.

436
01:43:11,670 --> 01:43:17,159
Oh, get off. Remember what I told? Hold on a second. Remember I told you something was

437
01:43:17,159 --> 01:43:28,170
going in my eye. This is like freaking me out now. Remember like an hour ago? Oh,

438
01:43:28,170 --> 01:43:33,100
something's like in my eye. How? This shit is melting off into my fucking eyes.

439
01:43:35,619 --> 01:43:43,430
All right. I got the edge scratched. Uh, I want to, let me go out. Let me go back out to

440
01:43:43,430 --> 01:43:51,619
like the menu menu. What is the slow mo? Let me try slow mo of like hitting somebody in the

441
01:43:51,619 --> 01:44:55,739
head. Get his weapon. I'll do it. I'll do it. I'll do it. That was three people. That

442
01:44:55,739 --> 01:45:08,949
guy's like, Oh, that was weird. I'm trying to like slit his throat. I gotta move on from this

443
01:45:08,949 --> 01:45:15,449
game, but like there's more to do. I'm like having so much fun. I can't. I gotta like hit

444
01:45:15,449 --> 01:45:24,140
somebody with another brick. Let's get like only bricks. I'm going to have plenty of cement

445
01:45:24,140 --> 01:45:46,859
blocks. Okay. Get them all up there. So spell wise, right? Do I have to like go to town

446
01:45:46,859 --> 01:45:52,279
and like buy shit? I've really only been doing this like weird arena thing. I'm going

447
01:45:52,279 --> 01:46:00,970
to look into that in a second. Let's get this started. I'm going to try to just hit

448
01:46:00,970 --> 01:46:18,039
people with fucking blocks. I'm going to rush somebody's head in between two logs. Are you

449
01:46:18,039 --> 01:46:53,020
ready for this shit? This is so fun. It's too fun. They made a, they gave me,

450
01:46:53,020 --> 01:47:03,529
they made a game that was too much fun to play on me. What the fuck is happening to me?

451
01:47:04,329 --> 01:47:33,460
Give it to me. Put it in my hand. Hold an ax. I'm holding this like a fucking soda.

452
01:47:55,140 --> 01:47:55,619
Come on.

453
01:49:03,420 --> 01:49:27,960
God damn it. I hit myself in the back. How do you block that? That's not blockable move.

454
01:49:27,960 --> 01:50:04,920
That's a non blockable move. Fuck. Put it in there. God, just run by it.

455
01:50:05,640 --> 01:50:44,659
Come on. I want to give it a marathon. Give me the game right. Come here. Get over here.

456
01:50:44,659 --> 01:50:45,770
Get over here.

457
01:50:45,770 --> 01:51:54,659
Oh, no. Jump. Give it to me. Give me something. Give me the dagger. What?

458
01:52:22,869 --> 01:52:25,829
Why did I just do that to her? Why did that just happen?

459
01:52:50,010 --> 01:53:15,420
Oh, what happened there folks? Shit. Don't have to fucking game fuck me like that.

460
01:53:15,819 --> 01:54:00,439
I was just sat on this fucking dick. What was that? This is intense. That was what? Medium level

461
01:54:00,439 --> 01:54:09,510
three? I doubt I wasn't really using the slow-mo that much. All right. Let me go back to the,

462
01:54:09,510 --> 01:54:21,939
like the menu. Look, I do that. What do we got here? Notes, controller, input,

463
01:54:23,340 --> 01:54:43,720
all these tips. Go to character, go home. Let's go home. Cool. All right. Let's go.

464
01:54:44,680 --> 01:54:52,520
Well, now I know I can do this. So fun. All right. Oh, we got this. More things here.

465
01:54:53,659 --> 01:55:01,609
The market. Someone put a price on your head. Now you're ambushed in town with no way out and

466
01:55:01,609 --> 01:55:08,630
everyone wants to bounty. It's either you or them. Okay. What about this one? This is the arena

467
01:55:08,630 --> 01:55:12,920
and this is the ruins. So this is the arena. This one, these are locked.

468
01:55:12,920 --> 01:55:27,579
Oh, these are work in progress. Okay. Let's go to market. Well, this is cool looking.

469
01:55:30,869 --> 01:55:40,779
Okay. Interesting place. What's over here? There's like a little blacksmith table.

470
01:55:41,500 --> 01:55:47,399
At least these weapons. Look at this. Oh, that's a big sword. That's like a bastard sword, right?

471
01:55:53,979 --> 01:56:15,420
It's a fine blade. It's hard to kind of use it like this though, because you got to use both.

472
01:56:16,460 --> 01:56:29,579
I'll give it a try. All right. What do we got here? Let's do, let's do easy wave two.

473
01:56:30,300 --> 01:56:42,140
The well. You can probably throw people down the well, I would assume.

474
01:56:43,180 --> 01:56:58,140
Do you ask? Two-handed is hard because the controls are so big.

475
01:57:00,739 --> 01:57:07,479
No, yeah. Two-handed ain't going to work. The controls are too large. They just smash into

476
01:57:07,479 --> 01:57:27,430
each other. I'm getting like wrapped up again in this cord. I'm like, step over the cord.

477
01:57:30,460 --> 01:57:35,430
My God. I gotta like, how do you pause the game? I'm like wrapped up again.

478
01:57:40,470 --> 01:57:45,560
Can't pause real life. Even if there is a cord in the back of your head that is

479
01:57:45,560 --> 01:57:52,439
wrapping around you like going out and having a dog and having another dog meet you because

480
01:57:52,439 --> 01:57:57,479
they're on the same sidewalk and then you get wrapped up by the fucking other person's leash

481
01:57:57,479 --> 01:58:01,000
and you do the thing when you walk around in circles. The dogs are wrapping you both up now

482
01:58:02,039 --> 01:58:05,399
and you're talking about like the fucking weather. That's what's happening to my

483
01:58:05,399 --> 01:58:09,640
body right now. There's a dog down here running in circles around two people. Two dogs.

484
01:58:10,920 --> 01:58:31,960
I'm going for the fucking thrust. What's happened? Did the game just lag? What's happening

485
01:58:31,960 --> 01:58:59,500
right now? Where did you go from? Oh fucking God, dude. Like really. Look at this shit.

486
01:59:20,220 --> 01:59:38,789
Getting a ceiling hook? I get like a ceiling tether. No, I gotta get the wireless thing.

487
01:59:43,079 --> 01:59:48,199
The headset just has to come off because it's just been spun around too many times.

488
01:59:48,760 --> 02:00:06,890
This cord is like such a thick-ass cord too. Hold on. I gotta get that ceiling tether.

489
02:00:06,890 --> 02:00:32,890
It's like I'm playing, I'm doing a puzzle right now. Oh, I'm sorry. People are gonna

490
02:00:33,130 --> 02:00:47,060
throw up from looking at this, aren't they? I'm sorry. It's almost done. Okay. All right. Yeah.

491
02:00:47,060 --> 02:00:50,500
No, that's it. Have a nice day. No, you got a beautiful dog. Beautiful dog. Yeah. What's his

492
02:00:50,500 --> 02:01:13,380
name? Oh, Ruff Ruff. Cool. Yeah. Mine's auto. Have a nice day. Fucking hell. All right.

493
02:01:13,380 --> 02:01:30,359
Last one. I'm gonna go to Beat Saber. I'm gonna make this one count. This game is so

494
02:01:30,359 --> 02:01:39,800
much fucking fun though. All right. Let's move. I'm gonna grab one more weapon that I haven't

495
02:01:39,800 --> 02:01:43,319
used. No, I want the bow and arrow. Bow and arrow is so much fun. I have to use the bow

496
02:01:43,319 --> 02:02:08,710
and arrow. What are you talking about? I don't need more. Okay. Let's get some slow motion

497
02:02:08,710 --> 02:02:13,880
headshots and then I'm gonna call it. We'll go to Beat Saber. Just do like way three. Easy.

498
02:02:13,880 --> 02:02:45,270
Go. Spoiled here. Okay. Let's get a slow motion headshot. Oh, got him. I need to get

499
02:02:45,270 --> 02:03:36,090
a good shot from far away. Ow. I hit my face. Give me the arrow. Give me the fucking arrow.

500
02:03:53,640 --> 02:05:03,140
Oh. Weapon. Weapon. Needed a weapon. Really? Worth potions? Oh fuck. I didn't hit the wall.

501
02:05:03,140 --> 02:05:12,180
I didn't hit the wall. I hit the stand that's over here with the lighthouse on it.

502
02:05:12,180 --> 02:05:35,720
That's all right. We're good. It's Beat Saber time. Too much like. Okay. All right. We're

503
02:05:35,720 --> 02:05:43,109
good. I'm still seeing. Get some water. Dude, you're sweating. I've been sweating

504
02:05:43,109 --> 02:05:49,609
this whole time. That's just the way it is. All right. Let's do Beat Saber. That was

505
02:05:49,609 --> 02:05:58,859
really fucking fun though. So how do I go like this? I think I can just exit from here, right?

506
02:05:59,420 --> 02:06:07,850
I think I can just quit the game from here. That's like I heard everybody at the same time

507
02:06:07,850 --> 02:06:19,529
go ooh. Ding. I was like mining fucking coal over here. That's what I'm doing. That's this

508
02:06:19,529 --> 02:06:41,270
one. Quit this really. Quit this reality. There we go. Play what you want to play. Yeah. I

509
02:06:41,270 --> 02:06:56,979
want to play Beat Saber. Oh, I think this crashed. I think the sorcerer game crashed.

510
02:06:59,140 --> 02:07:10,819
Blade and sorcery has not responding. Well, oh well. Let's open Beat Saber. Although somehow

511
02:07:10,819 --> 02:07:22,220
I can still hear the game. Why can I still hear? Why can I still hear that? You hear the birds?

512
02:07:23,020 --> 02:07:45,619
Why can I hear birds? What just happened? Oh, SteamVR had to like restart. Oh, okay. There we

513
02:07:45,619 --> 02:07:57,689
go. Wait, what? Oh, this is like the home thing. Okay. SteamVR home has the birds. I thought it was

514
02:07:57,689 --> 02:08:09,960
the other game. Let's do Beat Saber. Here it comes. We got a health and safety warning.

515
02:08:14,220 --> 02:08:18,649
All right. Let's get back in. Playing Beat Saber is dangerous. So you're going to get hurt.

516
02:08:20,039 --> 02:08:23,960
You're going to mine for coal on the pole. Then how is it? Hopefully I didn't fucking

517
02:08:23,960 --> 02:08:31,319
cause a problem on that. Those things are expensive. I think we're good though.

518
02:08:31,319 --> 02:08:50,710
Stay healthy. I'm good. I'm good. I'm healthy. Okay. Booting up. Here it comes. All right.

519
02:08:50,710 --> 02:08:53,989
A small percentage of people might experience seizures when exposed to certain lights,

520
02:08:53,989 --> 02:08:58,409
patterns or images. Oh, I'm going to change the... Is there a mod here that can change

521
02:08:58,409 --> 02:09:03,619
the game to Beat Saber? Cause I can't fucking do it. I'm a little preoccupied.

522
02:09:12,010 --> 02:09:27,079
Me, me, me. I can see. At least this one I don't have to move around. All right.

523
02:09:28,039 --> 02:10:00,069
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Those are going to make me puke if I do this like this.

524
02:10:00,789 --> 02:10:24,250
Open new window. What the fuck is it then? This is Puke City. Okay. I did just hear it.

525
02:10:24,250 --> 02:10:28,649
I heard who? I'm sorry everybody. But that was the first thing that happened. That was the

526
02:10:28,649 --> 02:10:39,180
front page. All right. Here we go. Virtual world. There we go. Beat Saber. All right.

527
02:10:39,180 --> 02:10:46,149
Update. If you want to refresh it, it'll show up there. Here we go. Beat Saber. Let's do it.

528
02:10:46,229 --> 02:10:53,260
Get in the game. Let me show you some of my fucking skills. This time I'm not going to

529
02:10:53,260 --> 02:11:00,810
ding over there. All right. Please read health and safety warnings in your VR headset

530
02:11:00,810 --> 02:11:03,609
instruction menu before playing Beat Saber because you may be encouraged to perform

531
02:11:03,609 --> 02:11:06,810
intense actions with your controllers. Make sure to review your surroundings and

532
02:11:06,810 --> 02:11:15,539
clearing obstacles in your play area. AKA you. High physical activities of all the same

533
02:11:15,539 --> 02:11:20,020
habits as doing a regular workout. Don't forget to stretch before playing and rest

534
02:11:20,020 --> 02:11:28,649
regularly. Don't worry. I'll be fine. All right. We got free play. Party. Levels played.

535
02:11:29,529 --> 02:11:32,250
Welcome. Thanks for purchasing our game. We're a small team working hard to bring you the

536
02:11:32,250 --> 02:11:39,300
best VR and rhythm experience possible. Cool. All right. Free. Let's just play for free.

537
02:11:40,859 --> 02:11:55,060
Let's do this tutorial. Holy shit. This is cool. Something about pork.

538
02:12:09,449 --> 02:12:22,710
Max the color and the direction. This is just like Space Channel 5.

539
02:12:32,340 --> 02:12:49,420
Do not cut or touch with sabers. Just like Fruit Ninja. Whoa. Make sure they're in the right spot.

540
02:12:55,109 --> 02:13:05,369
How's the audio? Loud enough? All right. I can barely see. Do like a funny emote if the

541
02:13:05,369 --> 02:13:16,869
audio is loud enough. I'm not seeing any funny emotes. That must mean. Okay. Hold on.

542
02:13:17,670 --> 02:13:39,399
There's no audio. What the fuck? What the fuck is that? Why did it do that?

543
02:13:39,960 --> 02:13:46,659
All right. We should be good. All right. I'm ready. Let's play Beat Saber.

544
02:13:46,979 --> 02:13:56,979
Stand right here. Free play. Pop stars. This is the one from League of Legends.

545
02:13:59,239 --> 02:14:01,800
Let's play pop stars from League of Legends.

546
02:14:13,060 --> 02:14:19,380
What? Whoa. Hey, I don't want to join anybody's group. Why is this on? Why is this on here?

547
02:14:52,380 --> 02:14:56,699
I'm losing the audio in my ear. Let's both fall out.

548
02:15:35,140 --> 02:15:40,500
How long is this song?

549
02:15:41,140 --> 02:15:48,220
League of Legends. What a fucked video game that is. What the fuck does that have to do with League of Legends?

550
02:15:49,739 --> 02:15:51,659
Is this one of the characters singing the song?

551
02:15:51,659 --> 02:17:42,010
I'm going to beat. I'm going to beat. I'll take a beat. B for boomer. Nice KD.

552
02:17:45,770 --> 02:17:48,729
It's a little loud. All right. Yeah. It looks, it does look a little loud, doesn't it?

553
02:17:49,370 --> 02:17:56,709
That's better. It was way too loud. It's all right. B for boomer. I'm going back in.

554
02:18:00,329 --> 02:18:04,680
This is really, really cool. I mean, I kind of have to like close my mouth and just play

555
02:18:04,680 --> 02:18:21,559
it, but this is fucking fun. You just like kind of zone in. How am I doing? That's a hair look.

556
02:18:21,559 --> 02:18:27,639
Let's do it again. Another one. What's, what's like a good song? What would you guys say is

557
02:18:27,639 --> 02:18:32,180
the best Beat Saber song? Let's take a look. Let's do, let's get it on hard and I gotta

558
02:18:32,180 --> 02:18:39,110
get ready. Okay. This is let, no, get. Well, who made that? Okay. What does this mean?

559
02:18:39,989 --> 02:18:46,819
Just single, solo, standard, one Saber. Okay. No arrows. Oh, I don't know about that one.

560
02:18:54,420 --> 02:19:13,559
Is this this one artist? Do I, how do I play like other ones? This is all songs I have.

561
02:19:14,280 --> 02:20:24,979
Let's try it. Make it a fuck for me on that one. Oh, God damn it. I don't, get out of my head.

562
02:20:51,299 --> 02:20:57,209
Steam notifications. I don't know how many times you have to turn off steam notifications

563
02:20:57,209 --> 02:21:02,489
and like delete it from your goddamn inventory, but it never stops. This one's

564
02:21:02,489 --> 02:23:10,889
better. I like this one. Let's start it up. Come on. Damn it. They fuck with you a little

565
02:23:10,889 --> 02:23:40,600
bit there. They fuck with you. A B? I'll take a B. Solo free play. Okay. All right. Looking

566
02:23:40,600 --> 02:23:47,020
good. How do you get more songs though? What's the other one? What's the other League

567
02:23:47,020 --> 02:23:54,790
of Legends song? Bring it on. Fucking expert. Let's go. You don't think I know what I'm

568
02:23:54,790 --> 02:25:24,540
doing? Don't, what the fuck valve? This is hard. This song's not even good. I don't like

569
02:25:24,540 --> 02:26:18,299
this song. It's a song on YouTube videos. This is a YouTuber song, right? Now this

570
02:26:18,299 --> 02:26:34,969
one's on a, this one's like easy though. So this is like a, oh, I'm going to hurt

571
02:26:34,969 --> 02:27:59,049
myself. I can do this on expert. Do I unlock songs? All right. We're going to do one

572
02:27:59,049 --> 02:29:39,899
more on expert. I thought, I can't, you kind of can't do the expert ones unless you,

573
02:29:39,899 --> 02:29:46,950
until you figure out like the muscle memory for the beat, can you? All right. Where's

574
02:29:46,950 --> 02:29:56,420
like the custom shit? How do I do the custom stuff? What's happening here? It's

575
02:29:56,420 --> 02:30:11,180
almost like for experts. This is really, really fucking fun. Songs, songs, songs.

576
02:30:13,879 --> 02:30:17,479
You need mods. You need mods. You need mods. Okay. All right. All right.

577
02:30:28,280 --> 02:30:35,209
Why do I look so feral? Go to the GitHub. Okay. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

578
02:30:35,209 --> 02:30:53,559
Does this have like steam workshop? I have to go to GitHub? Okay. There's no

579
02:30:53,559 --> 02:31:00,940
workshop. Oh, all right. Well, how, let me just get this installed then. And then

580
02:31:00,940 --> 02:31:05,979
where do you get the songs? From beatsaber.com? No, that's not real. That's a fake

581
02:31:05,979 --> 02:31:26,780
website. Is it really beatsaber? So install them from in the game. Okay. So let me

582
02:31:26,780 --> 02:31:36,139
just get this then. All right. How do I, they probably install custom mods.

583
02:31:36,780 --> 02:31:40,059
This uses modsaber to get the latest approved and manually verified mods,

584
02:31:40,139 --> 02:31:44,870
latest version automatically. Okay. So modsaber. This program currently supports

585
02:31:44,870 --> 02:31:54,250
every approved mod on modsaber.org. Okay. Song loader, camera plus song

586
02:31:54,250 --> 02:32:06,500
browser. There's a lot of shit here. Gameplay changes. I might, okay, here's

587
02:32:06,500 --> 02:32:10,170
what I'm going to do. I'm going to hold onto this for tomorrow night. I'm

588
02:32:10,170 --> 02:32:13,620
going to go get a bunch of shit. I need to like close the game. Let me

589
02:32:13,620 --> 02:32:17,879
get this for tomorrow. Let me get like all the shit that's necessary for

590
02:32:17,879 --> 02:32:24,149
it. And I'll like make sure it's, it's up and running and good because we're

591
02:32:24,149 --> 02:32:29,799
going to do it tomorrow night anyway. So I'll get, I'll get a bunch of good

592
02:32:29,799 --> 02:32:40,420
songs. Like country road. And I also need to get the mod that lets me

593
02:32:40,420 --> 02:32:43,620
like look at my hand and I, I discord channel to suggest songs.

594
02:32:47,670 --> 02:32:53,370
Yeah. I have the program. I have that VR drop program, but I couldn't

595
02:32:53,370 --> 02:32:56,090
get it to work. I could get it to open up chat, but I was trying to

596
02:32:56,090 --> 02:32:59,610
get it to like stay on my hand and how do I, you know, there's a lot

597
02:32:59,610 --> 02:33:02,729
of me to kind of do before that. I look haggard. I mean, it's because I

598
02:33:02,729 --> 02:33:06,649
have this, this shit on my face. All right, let's do, I'm going to do like

599
02:33:06,649 --> 02:33:08,729
a couple more, just the default ones and then we'll move on to,

600
02:33:10,329 --> 02:33:17,829
what's the other game that I got here? I got, I have, I have budget

601
02:33:17,829 --> 02:33:29,500
cuts. Let me do a few more. Yeah. This super hot VR, I get so much

602
02:33:29,500 --> 02:33:34,420
to play. I'm going to try to do like three, three games, three to

603
02:33:34,420 --> 02:33:39,079
four games a night, each game for about an hour. And then we're going

604
02:33:39,079 --> 02:33:41,079
to, I'm going to, I'm going like two or three days straight here, guys.

605
02:33:43,420 --> 02:33:49,059
Let me do one more of these fun ones and we'll, we'll go to budget cuts

606
02:33:50,069 --> 02:33:55,510
for like an hour or two. But I just, I just didn't know that you had

607
02:33:55,510 --> 02:34:11,739
to, Jeff, stop, stop, stop, stop it. Let's go.

608
02:34:30,969 --> 02:35:22,540
Fuck! I don't know how that, I don't know how that part goes.

609
02:35:23,590 --> 02:36:12,889
Don't do it. I did expert first try on that, that's a C, but it's the

610
02:36:12,889 --> 02:36:16,170
first time I've ever heard that song. I've never even heard that song

611
02:36:16,170 --> 02:37:13,000
before. I, I started to get it. I started to figure it out. Let's do

612
02:37:13,000 --> 02:38:30,379
that one on hard. When they switch it up on you like that. I think

613
02:38:30,379 --> 02:38:33,319
I got to the place of no return here and I'll tell you what I mean

614
02:38:33,319 --> 02:39:27,780
by that in a minute. So here's what I mean by that. Once you do hard

615
02:39:27,780 --> 02:39:32,020
and expert and you, especially expert, certain sections,

616
02:39:33,909 --> 02:39:36,870
certain sections of every one of these levels now, not on expert,

617
02:39:36,870 --> 02:39:40,950
feels too easy and certain sections are way too hard. You know what I

618
02:39:40,950 --> 02:39:43,510
mean? Like, I feel like I should have just done, but normal is,

619
02:39:43,510 --> 02:39:48,229
easy is too easy. I went, I did, I got, I went, pointed on return.

620
02:39:49,690 --> 02:39:59,530
All right, last one. Here we go. Did I already do this one? No, I

621
02:39:59,530 --> 02:40:38,469
didn't do this one today. I definitely didn't. See, like,

622
02:40:38,469 --> 02:40:42,309
this is too easy. You know what I mean? I've ruined it. Now I

623
02:40:42,309 --> 02:41:48,840
have to play this on expert. Whoa, whoa, I got cocky. Don't get

624
02:41:48,840 --> 02:42:50,579
cocky. I almost had a hundred percent. A B. How do you get a B

625
02:42:50,579 --> 02:42:55,420
with 293 out of 295? That's an A, that's an A plus. All right,

626
02:42:55,500 --> 02:42:57,659
now let me, like, eat my words. Do expert plus.

627
02:43:29,129 --> 02:43:42,180
That's fucking hard. Do it again? Again? No, we'll do this

628
02:43:42,180 --> 02:43:48,940
tomorrow. Holy fuck. I look like I'm supposed to be in a

629
02:43:48,940 --> 02:43:56,010
Ghostbusters movie or something. I look like shit. All right,

630
02:43:56,010 --> 02:44:02,200
let's, let's take our, let's take our final break of the

631
02:44:02,200 --> 02:44:08,379
evening. I'm going to get some more water and then, and then

632
02:44:08,379 --> 02:44:14,219
I'm going to open budget cuts and we'll play that for like

633
02:44:14,299 --> 02:44:18,139
an hour or two. And then I'm going to take my, my actual

634
02:44:18,139 --> 02:44:21,450
break from VR and we're going to go again tomorrow. So give

635
02:44:21,450 --> 02:44:29,959
me one second. Let me get another glass of water. Coal

636
02:44:29,959 --> 02:44:37,190
miner. Oh yeah. Well, first impressions of the Vive. The

637
02:44:37,190 --> 02:44:42,680
Vive is a hundred times better than PSVR. I would

638
02:44:42,680 --> 02:44:47,819
probably say safely. I'll be right back. Give me like two

639
02:44:47,819 --> 02:48:47,739
minutes. Okay, so let us get back in. Look at my hair.

640
02:48:48,379 --> 02:48:52,649
Can you imagine if I were to go, like I kind of want to go

641
02:48:52,649 --> 02:48:58,569
sit down like after today or tomorrow and go to a barber

642
02:48:58,569 --> 02:49:02,729
or a salon and just sit down and just be like, yeah, um,

643
02:49:02,729 --> 02:49:04,649
you know, I'm not sure what to do with it. Maybe you

644
02:49:04,649 --> 02:49:09,719
can have some suggestions on what I should do. Jesus

645
02:49:09,719 --> 02:49:20,389
fucking Christ. It's like matted up animal hair. Like

646
02:49:20,389 --> 02:49:22,629
that's, that's the kind of scenario with the lady or

647
02:49:23,030 --> 02:49:25,829
whoever it is, whoever it's like, that's a salon cut in

648
02:49:25,829 --> 02:49:29,219
your hair. You need to go to the doctor. Like you've got

649
02:49:29,219 --> 02:49:32,100
to go to like a surgeon to get this fixed. I can't do

650
02:49:32,100 --> 02:49:38,760
it for you. Get a hair net. No, I gotta get like a

651
02:49:38,760 --> 02:49:50,010
haircut. All right, here we go. Let's get back in.

652
02:49:50,010 --> 02:49:52,010
I'm not sure how this works, but I'm going to turn

653
02:49:52,010 --> 02:49:58,389
this on so you should see me here. BRB needs to get

654
02:49:58,389 --> 02:50:00,549
out of here. Budget cuts is this next game. This is

655
02:50:00,549 --> 02:50:10,659
going to be the last one tonight. Wish me luck and

656
02:50:10,659 --> 02:50:16,739
we'll be back tomorrow. What's going on here? Oh,

657
02:50:16,739 --> 02:50:19,299
fuck. Right. Hold on. I screwed this up. I'm going

658
02:50:19,299 --> 02:50:25,639
to move this back. The lighthouse has to move back

659
02:50:25,639 --> 02:50:36,500
where it belongs. Here. It's good. Communicate

660
02:50:36,500 --> 02:50:40,809
for a second. Uh, headset is not tracking. Not

661
02:50:40,809 --> 02:50:42,809
ready. Not ready. Not ready. Uh huh. I know it'll

662
02:50:42,809 --> 02:50:47,459
be ready in just a moment. There it is. All

663
02:50:47,459 --> 02:51:05,370
right. I'm going in. See you soon. Space camp too

664
02:51:05,370 --> 02:51:37,930
big. See you in an hour. Yeah. Ma, leave me

665
02:51:37,930 --> 02:51:42,170
alone, Ma. I'll do my homework in an hour. I'm

666
02:51:42,170 --> 02:51:54,819
currently in the oasis. Don't talk to me. Hold

667
02:51:54,819 --> 02:52:02,020
both. It's a start. Figure my controller. Don't

668
02:52:02,020 --> 02:52:11,219
you do it. In cords. Okay. Hold both pads to

669
02:52:11,219 --> 02:52:17,459
start budget cut story mode. That's not what I

670
02:52:17,459 --> 02:52:27,610
wanted to do. Hold both pads. What the hell

671
02:52:27,610 --> 02:52:31,850
is that? Budget cuts arcade. Wait. Hold both

672
02:52:31,850 --> 02:52:35,610
pads. That's an okay. Here we go. Room scale

673
02:52:35,610 --> 02:52:40,120
360 tracking. That's what I got. Sound effects,

674
02:52:40,200 --> 02:52:57,180
music. Okay. That's the one. Continue. Empty

675
02:52:57,180 --> 02:53:00,059
slot. Let's go. Difficulty standard graphics

676
02:53:00,059 --> 02:53:05,239
quality. Uh, I don't think it matters. Initializing

677
02:53:05,239 --> 02:53:07,079
cat seat. Look at over there. Look right

678
02:53:07,079 --> 02:53:09,159
there. Look at that. That's the one I hit

679
02:53:09,159 --> 02:53:12,040
by the way. Initializing. Calibrating space

680
02:53:12,040 --> 02:53:17,780
time. Please hold. I got battery halfway. I

681
02:53:17,780 --> 02:53:20,260
can, I can hear you guys. Don't worry. I

682
02:53:20,260 --> 02:53:32,600
got it. I'm in the oasis. Leave me alone.

683
02:53:32,600 --> 02:53:44,260
Let's just take this along. Initializing.

684
02:53:44,260 --> 02:53:46,180
Done. Calibrating space time. Please hold.

685
02:53:47,219 --> 02:53:53,030
Can you take it? Come on. Dinner's in the

686
02:53:53,030 --> 02:54:03,940
oven. Come on. This is supposed to take

687
02:54:03,940 --> 02:54:14,299
this long. Okay. Jesus. Try picking stuff

688
02:54:14,299 --> 02:54:20,940
up. Is it one of these games? Okay. Now

689
02:54:20,940 --> 02:54:24,659
press and hold this tiny button in your

690
02:54:24,659 --> 02:54:28,540
non-dominant hand. Bring this, bring,

691
02:54:28,540 --> 02:54:30,940
bring tool handle here. Hold the trigger

692
02:54:30,940 --> 02:54:37,700
to fire. Press any of the grip buttons

693
02:54:37,700 --> 02:54:52,409
to translocate. So you, that's how you

694
02:54:52,409 --> 02:54:58,729
move. Or is it? That's how you move.

695
02:54:58,729 --> 02:55:12,940
Okay. I'm fucking nuts. Can I do it? All

696
02:55:12,940 --> 02:55:17,500
right. Let's go. That's freaking me

697
02:55:17,500 --> 02:55:22,860
out. No, no. Okay. So we got a light

698
02:55:22,860 --> 02:55:26,790
switch. Turn it off. That hurts. What

699
02:55:26,790 --> 02:55:28,389
did I just turn off? No. Put the

700
02:55:28,389 --> 02:55:29,909
budget back on. Put the fucking budget

701
02:55:29,909 --> 02:55:31,829
back on. All right. Back over this way.

702
02:55:36,809 --> 02:55:39,319
Turn on the lights. Sure thing.

703
02:55:43,129 --> 02:55:58,620
What do you want to do? Laser secure

704
02:55:58,620 --> 02:56:16,440
anti-spy vent. Perfect. Okay. Can I sit

705
02:56:16,440 --> 02:56:17,879
on the couch? I can go over there. I

706
02:56:17,879 --> 02:56:24,469
can look at this. Computer. We got

707
02:56:24,469 --> 02:56:25,829
some other shit here. What's that?

708
02:56:25,829 --> 02:56:28,469
There's a wall right here. There's a

709
02:56:28,469 --> 02:56:29,670
wall right here. I don't know which

710
02:56:29,670 --> 02:56:30,790
one, but I know that it's there.

711
02:56:38,709 --> 02:56:45,190
Nothing in this. What's that? It's

712
02:56:45,190 --> 02:56:51,979
something. Is it brick? It's just

713
02:56:51,979 --> 02:57:00,180
bricks. Come on. There's no smashing

714
02:57:00,180 --> 02:57:10,309
sounds. Okay. You can't fucking leave

715
02:57:10,309 --> 02:57:16,389
me alone. I'm assuming I can take

716
02:57:16,389 --> 02:57:22,340
that off. Okay. Yeah. What's in

717
02:57:22,340 --> 02:57:25,350
there? There's tape in that room.

718
02:57:25,350 --> 02:57:36,299
Sure. And where's the wall? The

719
02:57:36,299 --> 02:58:02,069
actual wall. Okay. Now what the hell

720
02:58:02,069 --> 02:58:09,879
do you want me to do? What's that?

721
02:58:09,879 --> 02:58:13,579
Key card? Hold this touchpad to open

722
02:58:13,579 --> 02:58:15,899
your inventory. Use your other hand

723
02:58:15,899 --> 02:58:23,899
to drop items into this bubble. Okay.

724
02:58:23,899 --> 02:58:25,739
I got that. How many things can I

725
02:58:25,739 --> 02:58:33,340
hold? Wall coming up. Did it take the

726
02:58:33,340 --> 02:58:42,649
paintbrush? The tape? Caution, wet

727
02:58:42,649 --> 02:58:51,670
paint. Okay. Well, I have the

728
02:58:51,670 --> 02:58:59,620
key card to one. It looks like

729
02:58:59,620 --> 02:59:02,020
we're going over there. Well, it's

730
02:59:02,020 --> 02:59:09,059
two. Can I do something weird here?

731
02:59:10,659 --> 02:59:15,100
Is there a one back here?

732
02:59:20,299 --> 02:59:43,860
Oh. Oh. Well, I thought that the

733
02:59:43,860 --> 02:59:45,620
one was that you got to use this on

734
02:59:45,620 --> 02:59:46,979
one. You can't go on two until you

735
02:59:46,979 --> 02:59:56,840
get the code for two.

736
03:00:13,750 --> 03:00:17,049
Three hours earlier. Organic matter

737
03:00:17,049 --> 03:00:21,770
here. Keep it. Alan! Alan! Alan! Alan!

738
03:00:21,770 --> 03:00:23,690
I can hear you, Kate. I'm just

739
03:00:23,690 --> 03:00:26,440
choosing not to respond.

740
03:00:26,680 --> 03:00:30,200
Okay, then. Sure. Fine. I guess you

741
03:00:30,200 --> 03:00:31,559
don't want to know about where all

742
03:00:31,559 --> 03:00:32,600
our colleagues have been

743
03:00:32,600 --> 03:00:35,399
disappearing to. Professional. Wait.

744
03:00:35,399 --> 03:00:37,639
Okay, guests. I do want to know.

745
03:00:37,639 --> 03:00:39,159
I did the YouTuber joke. You gotta

746
03:00:39,159 --> 03:00:42,440
laugh. I'm divided attention.

747
03:00:42,440 --> 03:00:44,040
Well, I heard from Tracy the

748
03:00:44,040 --> 03:00:45,479
county that all the humans in her

749
03:00:45,479 --> 03:00:48,040
department have been reported to HR.

750
03:00:48,040 --> 03:00:49,979
They're human. Of course they're in

751
03:00:49,979 --> 03:00:51,899
violation of HR. That's where the

752
03:00:51,899 --> 03:00:54,540
phrase comes from. Human nature.

753
03:00:54,540 --> 03:00:57,739
Did you even listen in our orientation?

754
03:00:57,739 --> 03:01:01,340
Yes. But what you don't know is, is

755
03:01:01,340 --> 03:01:03,340
that they never come back.

756
03:01:03,340 --> 03:01:05,739
That's for you. You ain't going on

757
03:01:05,739 --> 03:01:08,299
that trip, Dickhead. Are you sure?

758
03:01:08,299 --> 03:01:11,100
Positive. They had a meeting with HR

759
03:01:11,100 --> 03:01:15,159
and then, Poof! Never seen again.

760
03:01:15,159 --> 03:01:17,319
Hey, you, too. That is worrying.

761
03:01:17,319 --> 03:01:19,959
Back to work. I do hope they're all

762
03:01:19,959 --> 03:01:24,780
right. All right. Okay. Open the

763
03:01:24,780 --> 03:01:27,350
briefcase.

764
03:01:27,350 --> 03:01:31,750
Press staple. All right. Hold that

765
03:01:31,750 --> 03:01:35,909
there.

766
03:01:35,909 --> 03:01:40,760
What are these drugs?

767
03:01:40,760 --> 03:01:44,120
No, but I need this.

768
03:01:44,120 --> 03:01:48,200
This pager was mailed to you. Enjoy.

769
03:01:48,200 --> 03:01:50,680
The next challenge is disruptive.

770
03:01:50,680 --> 03:01:55,030
What is it? Telephone? Hello?

771
03:01:55,030 --> 03:01:56,629
How do I use the phone?

772
03:01:56,629 --> 03:02:11,909
Do I press the button?

773
03:02:11,909 --> 03:02:19,909
Okay, you gotta hold. Okay, I got it.

774
03:02:19,909 --> 03:02:21,430
Ready?

775
03:02:24,309 --> 03:02:26,860
No, not that. Not 1982.

776
03:02:26,860 --> 03:02:30,940
Nineteen eighty-five.

777
03:02:30,940 --> 03:02:34,340
Hello, can you hear me? My name is

778
03:02:34,340 --> 03:02:36,500
Winta. And look, we can do the cute

779
03:02:36,500 --> 03:02:37,780
introductions later.

780
03:02:37,780 --> 03:02:40,420
You're in terrible danger. People

781
03:02:40,420 --> 03:02:42,020
keep disappearing around here.

782
03:02:42,020 --> 03:02:43,620
And I hate to tell you, but they're

783
03:02:43,620 --> 03:02:44,979
coming for you next.

784
03:02:44,979 --> 03:02:46,180
Now, I'm gonna help you get out of

785
03:02:46,180 --> 03:02:48,579
here, but we have to move quickly.

786
03:02:48,579 --> 03:02:51,299
See that locked briefcase? I hid the

787
03:02:51,299 --> 03:02:56,680
key for it on your desk.

788
03:02:56,680 --> 03:02:58,680
Wait, wait, wait! What's the objective? What?

789
03:02:58,680 --> 03:03:00,120
Get out of the building as fast as you

790
03:03:00,120 --> 03:03:02,680
can. What's the objective?

791
03:03:02,680 --> 03:03:04,600
Put it in your inventory.

792
03:03:04,600 --> 03:03:06,440
I'll ping you once you're clear. Now

793
03:03:06,440 --> 03:03:08,040
stay low and hurry.

794
03:03:08,040 --> 03:03:09,639
You can make it, but you have to go

795
03:03:09,639 --> 03:03:18,280
now. Your desk is a key

796
03:03:18,280 --> 03:03:20,360
under the pot and there's a

797
03:03:20,360 --> 03:03:24,149
translocator in there.

798
03:03:24,149 --> 03:03:28,340
And then you need to death bad

799
03:03:28,340 --> 03:03:31,780
jump from the building.

800
03:03:31,780 --> 03:03:32,899
From the elevator, go to the third

801
03:03:32,899 --> 03:03:36,920
floor. That's me.

802
03:03:36,920 --> 03:03:46,309
Hey, uh, hey, this is me.

803
03:03:46,309 --> 03:03:54,520
It's me. I'll put that in your prayer.

804
03:03:54,520 --> 03:04:01,139
All right, key behind plant. Key under

805
03:04:01,139 --> 03:04:02,739
the plant. Key? There's a key over the

806
03:04:02,739 --> 03:04:07,379
under the plant here.

807
03:04:07,379 --> 03:04:13,940
Which plant? You scared me! Where's the

808
03:04:13,940 --> 03:04:18,500
plant?

809
03:04:18,500 --> 03:04:29,670
Did I call the number again? Hold on.

810
03:04:29,670 --> 03:04:31,030
This is how the matrix starts. You

811
03:04:31,030 --> 03:04:32,950
need to leave right now.

812
03:04:32,950 --> 03:04:34,229
There's a key to the travel device

813
03:04:34,229 --> 03:04:36,149
hidden on your desk. Grab the pager,

814
03:04:36,149 --> 03:04:37,989
put it in your inventory, and get off

815
03:04:37,989 --> 03:04:40,790
this floor any way you can.

816
03:04:40,790 --> 03:04:42,389
Right, all right, so it was the plant.

817
03:04:42,389 --> 03:05:06,729
It's in the plant.

818
03:05:06,729 --> 03:05:12,040
Got it. How much money is in here?

819
03:05:12,040 --> 03:05:13,399
Oh, this is not a bucket. This is my

820
03:05:13,399 --> 03:05:15,719
walk. Beware. Do not do anything

821
03:05:15,719 --> 03:05:17,559
weird. Top secret.

822
03:05:17,559 --> 03:05:22,870
Move your controller to equip the

823
03:05:22,870 --> 03:05:30,379
translocator.

824
03:05:31,750 --> 03:05:33,670
Okay, uh, now it's time to go. I

825
03:05:33,670 --> 03:05:34,870
gotta get to the... Let me take these

826
03:05:34,870 --> 03:05:35,989
because I'm gonna, I'm scared I'm

827
03:05:35,989 --> 03:05:36,950
gonna need them.

828
03:05:36,950 --> 03:05:37,909
I'm gonna forget how to do

829
03:05:37,909 --> 03:05:40,709
everything. Reading emails.

830
03:05:40,709 --> 03:05:44,149
Okay. So, uh, your desk, go out,

831
03:05:44,149 --> 03:05:45,350
find the elevator, go to the third

832
03:05:45,350 --> 03:05:47,430
floor, and find me.

833
03:05:47,430 --> 03:05:52,010
You got it. Third floor, elevator.

834
03:05:52,010 --> 03:06:06,489
How about...

835
03:06:10,489 --> 03:06:13,959
I can only show you the door. You are

836
03:06:13,959 --> 03:06:16,840
the one that must walk through.

837
03:06:16,840 --> 03:06:26,299
There's an open window. Fruit travels

838
03:06:26,299 --> 03:06:28,059
through the air similar to a banana.

839
03:06:28,059 --> 03:06:29,659
Okay, so everything travels through

840
03:06:29,659 --> 03:06:45,639
the air similar to a banana.

841
03:06:45,639 --> 03:06:47,319
What is considered great at one point

842
03:06:47,319 --> 03:06:48,600
in time may or not have the connection

843
03:06:48,600 --> 03:06:49,879
to something previously considered

844
03:06:49,879 --> 03:06:51,319
small.

845
03:06:51,319 --> 03:07:00,569
I made it. Every day is taco day.

846
03:07:00,569 --> 03:07:12,059
Yeah, sure. All right, we're in.

847
03:07:12,059 --> 03:07:13,350
Find the elevator, go to the third

848
03:07:13,350 --> 03:07:16,090
floor. Itchy nose, hold on.

849
03:07:16,090 --> 03:07:23,110
Every day is taco day.

850
03:07:23,110 --> 03:07:27,579
What do we got? Soda?

851
03:07:27,579 --> 03:07:38,379
Did you eat something? I don't know

852
03:07:38,379 --> 03:08:12,979
you could do that.

853
03:08:13,059 --> 03:08:19,049
Well there. No, no, no, no, no. Go back

854
03:08:19,049 --> 03:08:19,850
out.

855
03:08:19,850 --> 03:08:55,739
Oh, whoopsie. You know, fuck off.

856
03:08:55,739 --> 03:09:38,059
Oh, hello. Get over here.

857
03:09:38,059 --> 03:09:44,760
That was close. I can't kill him. I'm

858
03:09:44,760 --> 03:09:55,239
trying. I'm trying to kill him.

859
03:09:55,239 --> 03:10:00,549
How could you? Damn it, man. Give me

860
03:10:00,549 --> 03:10:09,479
the fucking ashtray.

861
03:10:09,479 --> 03:10:16,920
Hey, look over here. Your point.

862
03:10:16,920 --> 03:10:18,520
This is a fucking ashtray, dude. How

863
03:10:18,600 --> 03:10:35,129
many? Oh, fuck what I hit. I don't know.

864
03:10:35,129 --> 03:11:05,639
Run out of time. Let's go. Get out

865
03:11:05,639 --> 03:11:08,120
there.

866
03:11:08,120 --> 03:11:27,690
Where is she? Tell me where she is.

867
03:11:27,690 --> 03:11:28,889
All right, what do we do? Gonna go to

868
03:11:28,889 --> 03:11:40,790
the elevator, right? It's like fighting

869
03:11:40,790 --> 03:11:43,379
back.

870
03:11:43,379 --> 03:11:47,000
I don't know where I am in my room.

871
03:11:47,000 --> 03:11:48,280
No, it's okay. Another person throw

872
03:11:48,280 --> 03:11:55,620
out a window. Cookie? All right, I need

873
03:11:55,620 --> 03:12:19,430
the elevator. Can I get a water?

874
03:12:19,430 --> 03:12:21,110
Where's that? Oh, there's coffee right

875
03:12:21,110 --> 03:12:32,379
there. Give me that.

876
03:12:32,379 --> 03:12:36,250
Give me coffee. I want the coffee. Well,

877
03:12:36,250 --> 03:12:37,610
how am I gonna get fucking coffee out of

878
03:12:37,610 --> 03:12:40,299
this thing?

879
03:12:40,299 --> 03:12:56,760
All right, let's go.

880
03:12:58,420 --> 03:13:02,920
Uh, what can you do for me? Anything?

881
03:13:02,920 --> 03:13:04,600
Who is this handsome devil with the

882
03:13:04,600 --> 03:13:06,760
death-set tones reaching out to me

883
03:13:06,760 --> 03:13:08,360
over the tannoy?

884
03:13:08,360 --> 03:13:12,280
Rex. Gold cup with ash or honey?

885
03:13:12,280 --> 03:13:14,200
And there's plenty of ways to describe

886
03:13:14,200 --> 03:13:15,239
me.

887
03:13:15,239 --> 03:13:17,159
International business playboy

888
03:13:17,159 --> 03:13:19,639
superstar. The writer is genius.

889
03:13:19,639 --> 03:13:22,520
That's so funny.

890
03:13:22,520 --> 03:13:30,889
Now 775 lost in time.

891
03:13:30,889 --> 03:13:36,149
Uh, I need to get something from you.

892
03:13:36,149 --> 03:13:39,379
Another day? Another dollar?

893
03:13:39,379 --> 03:13:42,260
Oh, no.

894
03:13:42,260 --> 03:13:45,139
Hello human. I am very busy with my

895
03:13:45,139 --> 03:13:48,459
tasks. Can we be friends?

896
03:13:48,459 --> 03:13:50,299
Uh, I don't know. You got anything

897
03:13:50,299 --> 03:13:51,979
under there for Elbertson?

898
03:13:51,979 --> 03:13:57,030
Fuck you. Here's the elevator. I found it.

899
03:13:57,030 --> 03:13:58,229
Level three.

900
03:13:58,309 --> 03:14:09,700
Do I need money? That's a wall.

901
03:14:09,700 --> 03:14:14,149
All right, do I have a soda? All right,

902
03:14:14,149 --> 03:14:15,430
hold on. Wait, wait, wait. Get rid of

903
03:14:15,430 --> 03:14:17,110
this. I don't need that anymore.

904
03:14:17,110 --> 03:14:18,409
I don't need this anymore. I need to

905
03:14:18,409 --> 03:14:19,610
know what you look like, Phil. Let's

906
03:14:19,610 --> 03:14:20,649
take a couple sodas.

907
03:14:20,649 --> 03:14:23,049
Let's get some sodas. At least one or

908
03:14:23,049 --> 03:14:25,129
two. I need to have a whole lunch.

909
03:14:25,129 --> 03:14:28,780
All right, I got a whole lunch now. We got

910
03:14:28,780 --> 03:14:31,420
apple, cookie, two sodas.

911
03:14:31,420 --> 03:14:38,389
Perfect American lunch.

912
03:14:38,389 --> 03:14:42,149
The wall. What am I gonna touch? I

913
03:14:42,149 --> 03:14:47,770
don't know. Gonna be very slow.

914
03:14:49,239 --> 03:14:58,569
Floor three, right? Bingo. Let's go.

915
03:14:58,569 --> 03:15:06,489
360 degrees of fun.

916
03:15:06,489 --> 03:15:10,569
Supervision Acquisitions HR COM team.

917
03:15:10,569 --> 03:15:14,010
And that guy. That guy over there.

918
03:15:14,010 --> 03:15:16,549
We got a new phone. Wait, mission

919
03:15:16,549 --> 03:15:20,579
objective updated.

920
03:15:20,579 --> 03:15:25,159
204- what the- okay.

921
03:15:25,159 --> 03:15:32,840
2048. Isn't that like an iPhone game?

922
03:15:32,840 --> 03:15:39,620
No. No.

923
03:15:39,620 --> 03:15:42,500
Right, you made it. The quickest way to the exit is

924
03:15:42,500 --> 03:15:44,180
via the acquisitions department, but

925
03:15:44,180 --> 03:15:46,180
there are robots of the unfriendly kind

926
03:15:46,180 --> 03:15:48,659
of head. TransCorp insists on using

927
03:15:48,659 --> 03:15:50,420
military-grade assault robots for

928
03:15:50,420 --> 03:15:51,940
supervisor duties.

929
03:15:51,940 --> 03:15:55,379
So efficient. Not. Use the stealth

930
03:15:55,379 --> 03:15:56,979
feature on the translocator to avoid

931
03:15:56,979 --> 03:15:57,700
alerting them.

932
03:15:57,700 --> 03:16:00,100
Stealth feature? You'll need an access card.

933
03:16:00,100 --> 03:16:01,459
I think the manager on this floor

934
03:16:01,459 --> 03:16:02,420
might have one.

935
03:16:02,420 --> 03:16:04,340
Grab it and head to acquisitions. Good

936
03:16:04,340 --> 03:16:06,739
luck. Okay.

937
03:16:06,739 --> 03:16:10,940
So I have a- is this stealth?

938
03:16:10,940 --> 03:16:15,260
Is this my stealth right now?

939
03:16:15,260 --> 03:16:18,180
This is like a bug net. I don't know

940
03:16:18,180 --> 03:16:20,020
what to do.

941
03:16:20,020 --> 03:16:32,729
The stealth feature. Oh, I was probably

942
03:16:32,729 --> 03:16:33,850
going to call you back.

943
03:16:33,850 --> 03:16:35,290
Get to acquisitions. Might need a key

944
03:16:35,290 --> 03:16:37,850
card. I have a key card, didn't I?

945
03:16:37,850 --> 03:16:40,329
I have a key card. What happened to one?

946
03:16:40,329 --> 03:16:43,959
Did I throw the key card down?

947
03:16:43,959 --> 03:16:45,719
Okay, watch out. That first- that guy's

948
03:16:45,719 --> 03:16:47,319
going to shoot at me.

949
03:16:47,319 --> 03:16:49,059
And there is a stealth- I don't even

950
03:16:49,059 --> 03:16:50,979
know what this does.

951
03:16:50,979 --> 03:17:12,790
Use the stealth feature. You know-

952
03:17:14,649 --> 03:17:16,649
I'm just gonna fucking go over there.

953
03:17:16,649 --> 03:17:19,930
I'll get a tutorial right now, won't I?

954
03:17:19,930 --> 03:17:21,770
All right, where's my tutorial?

955
03:17:21,770 --> 03:17:23,290
Friends, I'm sure you

956
03:17:23,290 --> 03:17:25,129
already noticed your brand new

957
03:17:25,129 --> 03:17:27,370
supervisor colleagues have leaked.

958
03:17:27,370 --> 03:17:29,850
I have a difficult enough job keeping

959
03:17:29,850 --> 03:17:30,729
everyone

960
03:17:30,729 --> 03:17:32,969
focused on the task at hand.

961
03:17:32,969 --> 03:17:34,729
The setup let their bandits concern

962
03:17:34,729 --> 03:17:35,450
you?

963
03:17:35,450 --> 03:17:38,250
No, really. Don't.

964
03:17:38,250 --> 03:17:45,690
I don't know.

965
03:17:45,770 --> 03:17:48,969
I thought it was like a fucking scrambler.

966
03:17:48,969 --> 03:17:51,930
Hope both paths to reapply.

967
03:17:51,930 --> 03:18:09,979
All right, mission objective updated.

968
03:18:09,979 --> 03:18:11,260
Yeah, but

969
03:18:11,260 --> 03:18:16,059
how the hell do I do the thing?

970
03:18:16,059 --> 03:18:21,819
Listen again.

971
03:18:21,819 --> 03:18:25,930
All right, you made it. The quickest

972
03:18:25,930 --> 03:18:27,209
way to the exit is via the

973
03:18:27,209 --> 03:18:28,409
acquisitions department.

974
03:18:28,409 --> 03:18:30,329
There are robots of the unfriendly

975
03:18:30,329 --> 03:18:31,610
kind ahead.

976
03:18:31,610 --> 03:18:33,530
Transcorp insists on using military

977
03:18:33,530 --> 03:18:35,290
grade assault robots for supervisor

978
03:18:35,290 --> 03:18:36,889
duties. They use a handout.

979
03:18:36,889 --> 03:18:40,010
Efficient. Not. Use the stealth feature

980
03:18:40,010 --> 03:18:41,690
on the translocator to avoid alerting

981
03:18:41,690 --> 03:18:42,489
them.

982
03:18:42,489 --> 03:18:46,090
Oh, you'll need an access card.

983
03:18:46,090 --> 03:18:49,370
The stealth feature?

984
03:18:49,370 --> 03:18:54,899
They didn't tell me this last time.

985
03:18:54,899 --> 03:18:56,420
When portal is open, press and hold to

986
03:18:56,420 --> 03:18:57,780
translocate silently.

987
03:18:57,780 --> 03:19:04,649
They didn't tell me that before.

988
03:19:04,649 --> 03:19:07,129
Friends, I'm sure you already noticed

989
03:19:07,129 --> 03:19:09,450
your brand new supervisor colleagues

990
03:19:09,450 --> 03:19:10,329
have leaked.

991
03:19:10,329 --> 03:19:12,809
I have a difficult enough job keeping

992
03:19:12,809 --> 03:19:15,850
everyone focused on the task at hand.

993
03:19:15,850 --> 03:19:17,690
Just don't let their methods concern

994
03:19:17,690 --> 03:19:18,409
you.

995
03:19:18,409 --> 03:19:21,370
No really, don't let their methods

996
03:19:21,370 --> 03:19:23,930
concern you.

997
03:19:23,930 --> 03:19:25,690
Don't look, don't look, don't look.

998
03:19:25,690 --> 03:19:26,569
I don't know if that is what I'm

999
03:19:26,569 --> 03:19:28,010
taking.

1000
03:19:28,010 --> 03:19:32,069
Achievement unlocked. I got a crab.

1001
03:19:32,069 --> 03:19:35,430
Everything seems quiet. Maybe

1002
03:19:35,430 --> 03:19:41,239
too quiet. Is that a window?

1003
03:19:41,239 --> 03:19:42,360
Fucking gods, I thought it was an

1004
03:19:42,360 --> 03:19:45,270
open window.

1005
03:19:45,350 --> 03:19:48,149
I thought it was an open, I thought it was

1006
03:19:48,149 --> 03:19:53,290
and why would that have helped anyways?

1007
03:19:53,290 --> 03:19:54,729
How would he have even done anything

1008
03:19:54,729 --> 03:19:56,090
about that? He would have, I thought

1009
03:19:56,090 --> 03:19:57,129
he was going to look down like metal

1010
03:19:57,129 --> 03:19:58,489
gear solid or something.

1011
03:19:58,489 --> 03:20:06,579
All right, I got it, I got it. I gotta

1012
03:20:06,579 --> 03:20:08,100
turn it on. I know, I know, just look.

1013
03:20:08,100 --> 03:20:09,379
I'm gonna dial the number.

1014
03:20:09,379 --> 03:20:13,899
I know the fucking phone number already.

1015
03:20:13,899 --> 03:20:29,379
Lady, just. Okay, here we go.

1016
03:20:29,379 --> 03:20:31,139
What's in there?

1017
03:20:31,139 --> 03:20:32,020
Manager.

1018
03:20:32,020 --> 03:20:34,260
New supervisor colleagues have leaked.

1019
03:20:34,260 --> 03:20:36,739
I have a difficult enough job keeping

1020
03:20:36,739 --> 03:20:39,780
everyone focused on the task at hand.

1021
03:20:39,860 --> 03:20:42,420
Sit up. Let their methods concern you.

1022
03:20:42,420 --> 03:20:45,379
No really. Don't let their methods

1023
03:20:45,379 --> 03:20:46,899
concern you. Manager's office is right

1024
03:20:46,899 --> 03:20:51,079
there.

1025
03:20:51,079 --> 03:20:54,520
I watch all the things. I see all the

1026
03:20:54,520 --> 03:20:59,159
things. I shoot all the things.

1027
03:20:59,159 --> 03:21:02,250
See ya. Okay, I'm in the manager's

1028
03:21:02,250 --> 03:21:08,040
office. I made it.

1029
03:21:08,040 --> 03:21:17,500
Manager's desk? Okay, manager's desk.

1030
03:21:17,500 --> 03:21:18,620
Don't have the urge to throw a

1031
03:21:18,620 --> 03:21:19,819
fucking rock over there. I know you

1032
03:21:19,819 --> 03:21:22,940
want to.

1033
03:21:22,940 --> 03:21:24,860
Anything in the filing cabinets? No.

1034
03:21:24,860 --> 03:21:28,979
All right, manager's desk. Need a key

1035
03:21:28,979 --> 03:21:48,120
card.

1036
03:21:48,120 --> 03:21:51,000
Tuesday. Schedule meeting with Adam in

1037
03:21:51,000 --> 03:21:53,100
HR for that.

1038
03:21:53,100 --> 03:21:55,260
The stupid worker who left her key

1039
03:21:55,260 --> 03:21:56,940
card in plain sight in the yellow

1040
03:21:56,940 --> 03:21:58,459
section.

1041
03:21:58,459 --> 03:22:04,739
Stupid worker who left her

1042
03:22:04,739 --> 03:22:06,579
key card in plain sight in the

1043
03:22:06,579 --> 03:22:08,500
yellow section.

1044
03:22:08,500 --> 03:22:15,219
The yellow section. Is that orange?

1045
03:22:15,219 --> 03:22:20,520
We're gonna go to the yellow section.

1046
03:22:20,600 --> 03:22:33,239
Nobody in here?

1047
03:22:33,239 --> 03:22:37,459
Anomalous human.

1048
03:22:37,459 --> 03:22:46,889
That's blue. That's red. All right, I'm fine here.

1049
03:22:46,889 --> 03:22:48,489
Is that yellow down there maybe? I have no

1050
03:22:48,489 --> 03:22:55,030
idea.

1051
03:22:55,030 --> 03:22:58,280
Yellow's over here. That's yellow, right?

1052
03:22:58,280 --> 03:23:00,120
This is yellow. In plain sight in the

1053
03:23:00,120 --> 03:23:02,329
yellow section.

1054
03:23:02,329 --> 03:23:07,659
Can I get over there?

1055
03:23:10,139 --> 03:23:13,659
This is pretty yellow. HR. There it is.

1056
03:23:13,659 --> 03:23:17,989
HR. Yellow. What am I? I can stand

1057
03:23:17,989 --> 03:23:19,750
up. What am I doing?

1058
03:23:19,750 --> 03:23:22,170
I need the key card. Where's the yellow

1059
03:23:22,170 --> 03:23:28,979
section? Key card in plain sight.

1060
03:23:28,979 --> 03:23:52,979
Oh, it's already open. I don't always

1061
03:23:52,979 --> 03:23:59,639
let my guard down.

1062
03:23:59,639 --> 03:24:09,270
All right, what about over there? Right

1063
03:24:09,270 --> 03:24:13,350
down there?

1064
03:24:13,350 --> 03:24:20,010
Right into the desk. No, come on.

1065
03:24:20,010 --> 03:24:24,440
Better shot than that.

1066
03:24:24,440 --> 03:24:38,180
All right, I'm in. Did they come all

1067
03:24:38,180 --> 03:24:39,780
the way down here?

1068
03:24:39,780 --> 03:24:44,540
Doesn't look like it. All right, I'm

1069
03:24:44,540 --> 03:24:49,260
preparing a key card.

1070
03:24:49,260 --> 03:24:51,260
I've received a few notes about your

1071
03:24:51,260 --> 03:24:53,020
supervisors of late.

1072
03:24:53,020 --> 03:24:55,500
Please remember, any complaints will be

1073
03:24:55,500 --> 03:24:57,020
noted with Adam.

1074
03:24:57,020 --> 03:25:00,299
I heard of HR. He was always very keen

1075
03:25:00,299 --> 03:25:02,860
to know exactly who you are in

1076
03:25:02,860 --> 03:25:06,629
explicit detail.

1077
03:25:06,629 --> 03:25:15,399
Where's your key card?

1078
03:25:15,399 --> 03:25:33,100
That was the right idea. I was down

1079
03:25:33,100 --> 03:25:34,459
in the right spot.

1080
03:25:34,459 --> 03:25:38,120
I curled. You guys didn't. I don't think you saw it, but I curled up

1081
03:25:38,120 --> 03:25:42,020
into a fetal position.

1082
03:25:42,020 --> 03:25:46,100
I'm too immersed. Oh, thank god it just

1083
03:25:46,100 --> 03:25:47,219
puts me right here.

1084
03:25:47,219 --> 03:26:17,739
All right, let's go. Okay, there it is. Can I

1085
03:26:17,739 --> 03:26:20,280
scrap it through the portal?

1086
03:26:20,280 --> 03:26:21,719
Really? I can't just put my hand in

1087
03:26:21,719 --> 03:26:23,479
there? All right, wait till it's gone and

1088
03:26:23,479 --> 03:26:24,520
I'm going to come back and shoot it.

1089
03:26:24,520 --> 03:26:29,530
Ready? Here we go. One, two, three, go.

1090
03:26:29,530 --> 03:26:32,010
Oh, what are these cookies?

1091
03:26:32,010 --> 03:26:35,049
Please hold the text. What?

1092
03:26:35,049 --> 03:26:37,049
I've received a few notes about your

1093
03:26:37,049 --> 03:26:38,809
supervisors of late.

1094
03:26:38,809 --> 03:26:41,290
Please remember, any complaints will be

1095
03:26:41,290 --> 03:26:44,409
noted with Aria.

1096
03:26:44,409 --> 03:26:47,670
This very keen to know exactly who you

1097
03:26:47,670 --> 03:26:50,229
are.

1098
03:26:50,229 --> 03:26:57,100
Okay, I got it. I've never made that

1099
03:26:57,100 --> 03:27:08,500
kind of noise before.

1100
03:27:08,500 --> 03:27:10,739
A cartoon bird. All right, let's get out

1101
03:27:10,739 --> 03:27:19,829
of here.

1102
03:27:19,829 --> 03:27:43,860
Hey! What does this say?

1103
03:27:43,860 --> 03:27:47,459
Placeholder text for a lazy dev.

1104
03:27:47,459 --> 03:27:49,139
Forgot to replace the proper text

1105
03:27:49,139 --> 03:27:52,659
ring thingy. So you suck, whiz,

1106
03:27:52,659 --> 03:27:55,540
dev. Wow, it takes effort to write

1107
03:27:55,540 --> 03:27:56,739
more than a couple words for some

1108
03:27:56,739 --> 03:27:58,100
reason. I just wanted to fill

1109
03:27:58,100 --> 03:28:00,180
an A4 like, you know, with things. I

1110
03:28:00,180 --> 03:28:02,979
don't know. This is enough.

1111
03:28:05,850 --> 03:28:15,379
All right, I got the key card. We need to go to acquisitions.

1112
03:28:15,379 --> 03:28:21,530
Store that one. What? Oh, did I beat

1113
03:28:21,530 --> 03:28:25,850
the mission?

1114
03:28:25,850 --> 03:28:35,510
Pretty good. Why is this not fucking

1115
03:28:35,510 --> 03:28:40,709
Beat Saber? You know what I'm saying, kid?

1116
03:28:40,709 --> 03:28:43,399
Why is that? I don't have Beat Saber, kid.

1117
03:28:43,399 --> 03:28:58,819
All right, now where for? Interesting.

1118
03:28:58,819 --> 03:29:02,260
Welcome, everything's fine. This is a

1119
03:29:02,260 --> 03:29:06,170
very orange room. That's one single

1120
03:29:06,170 --> 03:29:07,829
orange.

1121
03:29:07,829 --> 03:29:19,110
Just give me a single orange, man.

1122
03:29:19,110 --> 03:29:21,620
Cool. All right, we got acquisitions,

1123
03:29:21,620 --> 03:29:23,219
distribution, cybernetics, public work,

1124
03:29:23,219 --> 03:29:24,579
statistics,

1125
03:29:24,579 --> 03:29:25,940
which is in here. So we need to go

1126
03:29:25,940 --> 03:29:27,459
to acquisitions.

1127
03:29:27,459 --> 03:29:41,850
This card doesn't work.

1128
03:29:41,850 --> 03:29:50,260
Okay, uh, right, right.

1129
03:29:50,260 --> 03:30:07,850
Uh, so how do I get up there?

1130
03:30:13,370 --> 03:30:16,100
Come on, Georgie. Come on down here,

1131
03:30:16,100 --> 03:30:19,299
Georgie.

1132
03:30:19,299 --> 03:30:32,170
I'm gonna bite your eyeball, kid.

1133
03:30:32,170 --> 03:30:38,040
Whoa, almost fell down. Attention. What

1134
03:30:38,040 --> 03:30:39,559
does it say? Attention.

1135
03:30:39,559 --> 03:30:41,799
Ventilation shafts ahead. This ventilation

1136
03:30:41,799 --> 03:30:44,200
connected to acquisitions,

1137
03:30:44,200 --> 03:30:45,639
distributions, lost and found, and

1138
03:30:45,639 --> 03:30:47,399
restaurants, okay?

1139
03:30:47,399 --> 03:30:49,479
So this ventilation connected to

1140
03:30:49,479 --> 03:30:54,180
acquisitions.

1141
03:30:54,180 --> 03:31:02,309
Okay, where's the vent? Oh, that's a vent.

1142
03:31:02,309 --> 03:31:08,020
Well, we'll just, let's go. Nothing else

1143
03:31:08,020 --> 03:31:11,049
I can do. Just go in here.

1144
03:31:11,049 --> 03:31:14,170
All right, we got fork, knife,

1145
03:31:14,170 --> 03:31:20,440
area to go, uh, the gas can of some

1146
03:31:20,440 --> 03:31:21,239
sort.

1147
03:31:21,239 --> 03:31:23,459
What do you want the gas can, you

1148
03:31:23,459 --> 03:31:25,780
think? Probably gonna need it down

1149
03:31:25,780 --> 03:31:29,139
there.

1150
03:31:29,139 --> 03:31:35,110
One, two, three.

1151
03:31:35,110 --> 03:31:48,840
That didn't do anything. Okay,

1152
03:31:48,840 --> 03:31:54,729
what else we got? Okay, go across

1153
03:31:54,729 --> 03:31:55,370
there.

1154
03:31:55,370 --> 03:31:59,909
Let's just do it.

1155
03:32:00,469 --> 03:32:06,469
Is this death? Yeah. All right, let's

1156
03:32:06,469 --> 03:32:07,670
sneak through. I'm gonna get jumpscared in

1157
03:32:07,670 --> 03:32:19,459
here or something, aren't I?

1158
03:32:19,459 --> 03:32:31,590
Okay, I can stand up now. Interesting.

1159
03:32:31,590 --> 03:32:33,430
We're gonna go that way.

1160
03:32:33,430 --> 03:32:44,469
It's not in. It is. Ah!

1161
03:32:44,469 --> 03:32:46,229
Well, this seems to be a dead end. No,

1162
03:32:46,229 --> 03:32:47,670
it's not.

1163
03:32:47,670 --> 03:33:01,100
There's no animals in here. The brush

1164
03:33:01,100 --> 03:33:04,549
is mightier than the sword. That's

1165
03:33:04,549 --> 03:33:20,149
what they're describing, okay?

1166
03:33:20,229 --> 03:33:23,379
That exploded. That thing was already

1167
03:33:23,379 --> 03:33:24,579
ready to blow up.

1168
03:33:24,579 --> 03:33:30,440
Nothing else I can do in here. Let's just keep moving.

1169
03:33:30,440 --> 03:33:39,579
Hey there, Georgie! Can you guys even

1170
03:33:39,579 --> 03:33:41,100
fucking see me right now?

1171
03:33:41,100 --> 03:33:51,399
I might feel like on camera. Button,

1172
03:33:51,399 --> 03:33:56,500
what do these do? I don't know if they do

1173
03:33:56,500 --> 03:34:15,159
anything. I have to do something with this.

1174
03:34:15,159 --> 03:34:21,799
Oh, hello. Bathroom, we made it.

1175
03:34:21,799 --> 03:34:36,469
Wow, you have an appearance. Whoa,

1176
03:34:36,469 --> 03:34:40,329
Twitter.

1177
03:34:40,329 --> 03:34:41,770
Ah, soap. I gotta play with the soap,

1178
03:34:41,770 --> 03:34:43,290
Spencer. I mean, it's a VR game. You

1179
03:34:43,290 --> 03:34:45,290
gotta click on everything, right?

1180
03:34:45,290 --> 03:34:46,979
You didn't program soap to come out

1181
03:34:46,979 --> 03:34:48,020
of the soap, Spencer. What are you

1182
03:34:48,020 --> 03:34:49,700
fucking kidding me?

1183
03:34:49,700 --> 03:35:02,040
Let's go in trash. Anybody in here?

1184
03:35:02,040 --> 03:35:11,000
All right, well, let's get in.

1185
03:35:11,000 --> 03:35:25,719
Oh, don't mind me. I'm just in the

1186
03:35:25,719 --> 03:35:26,680
bathroom.

1187
03:35:26,680 --> 03:35:31,319
All right, let's fucking get it down

1188
03:35:31,319 --> 03:35:34,100
here.

1189
03:35:34,100 --> 03:35:36,340
All right, I'm fucking ready. You ready?

1190
03:35:36,340 --> 03:35:37,860
Ah!

1191
03:35:37,860 --> 03:35:58,459
I gotta get out of the bathroom. All right, let me get out of the bathroom.

1192
03:35:58,459 --> 03:36:03,819
It's just like the other one. Need some

1193
03:36:03,819 --> 03:36:10,760
TP? Sure, I'll get it for you.

1194
03:36:10,760 --> 03:36:14,899
I gotta get out of this. I gotta...

1195
03:36:22,709 --> 03:36:25,540
All right, no fucking... Is there a wall?

1196
03:36:25,540 --> 03:36:28,620
There's a wall coming up.

1197
03:36:28,620 --> 03:36:46,860
Oh, I don't know where I am in the room.

1198
03:36:46,860 --> 03:36:48,860
I was slamming that on my knee. It was

1199
03:36:48,860 --> 03:36:50,459
like right on my knee. My knee was

1200
03:36:50,459 --> 03:36:51,100
right there.

1201
03:36:51,100 --> 03:36:59,350
It hurt. The stall's open out

1202
03:36:59,350 --> 03:37:00,469
this way.

1203
03:37:00,469 --> 03:37:13,940
There's gonna be a guy in here,

1204
03:37:13,940 --> 03:37:16,020
right? He's gonna be like, oh,

1205
03:37:16,020 --> 03:37:21,639
excuse me, right?

1206
03:37:21,639 --> 03:37:25,559
No, nobody in here. Nobody even in

1207
03:37:25,559 --> 03:37:26,360
the bathroom.

1208
03:37:26,360 --> 03:37:29,590
Oh, what am I gonna do about my fucking

1209
03:37:29,590 --> 03:37:46,469
alcohol moments?

1210
03:37:46,469 --> 03:37:51,700
All right, I gotta get out of the bathroom before I do something that I'm

1211
03:37:51,700 --> 03:37:52,819
gonna get in trouble for.

1212
03:37:52,819 --> 03:37:55,219
Get me out of the bathroom now. I don't

1213
03:37:55,219 --> 03:37:56,420
care about an item. Get me out.

1214
03:37:56,420 --> 03:37:59,459
Leave. Bathroom. Now. Bathroom. Out.

1215
03:37:59,459 --> 03:38:10,840
...meditations. You know, they used to hear me talk and think I was as good as a player.

1216
03:38:10,840 --> 03:38:12,520
Lost and found again.

1217
03:38:12,520 --> 03:38:15,799
But look at me now. Am I on tech empire?

1218
03:38:15,799 --> 03:38:17,799
Reading you this motivational note in my

1219
03:38:17,799 --> 03:38:18,920
favorite hand.

1220
03:38:18,920 --> 03:38:21,559
So remember, we all in the same boat.

1221
03:38:21,559 --> 03:38:22,360
75.

1222
03:38:22,360 --> 03:38:26,760
That is probably bigger and more expensive.

1223
03:38:26,760 --> 03:38:29,319
So what is our objective right now?

1224
03:38:30,309 --> 03:38:31,430
Something, right?

1225
03:38:31,430 --> 03:38:37,379
Home sweet office.

1226
03:38:37,379 --> 03:38:37,860
Hey!

1227
03:38:37,860 --> 03:38:39,940
Oh, the microphone doesn't work.

1228
03:38:39,940 --> 03:38:41,780
Can I be back? Can I get back here?

1229
03:38:41,780 --> 03:38:44,950
Well, I guess I can get back here.

1230
03:38:44,950 --> 03:38:47,989
Fucking secret. You guys didn't think I was gonna get fucked secret.

1231
03:38:47,989 --> 03:38:49,909
The early bird.

1232
03:38:49,909 --> 03:38:54,329
Look at this shit.

1233
03:38:54,329 --> 03:38:56,329
What's going on on my shelf?

1234
03:39:04,299 --> 03:39:05,420
Nah, I need something heavier.

1235
03:39:05,420 --> 03:39:07,979
Oh, excuse you.

1236
03:39:07,979 --> 03:39:12,149
Oh, whoopsie.

1237
03:39:12,149 --> 03:39:15,530
Okay, box.

1238
03:39:15,530 --> 03:39:20,819
This one needs a level one security code. I have that.

1239
03:39:20,819 --> 03:39:29,909
Give it a swipe.

1240
03:39:29,909 --> 03:39:31,209
What happened?

1241
03:39:31,209 --> 03:39:36,920
Oh, five, seven, and eleven.

1242
03:39:36,920 --> 03:39:38,920
Five, seven, one, one.

1243
03:39:38,920 --> 03:39:39,799
Hello?

1244
03:39:39,799 --> 03:39:40,760
Yeah?

1245
03:39:40,760 --> 03:39:45,159
I'm not sure if this line is tapped, so there's a package of

1246
03:39:45,159 --> 03:39:49,000
letterers waiting for you in the distributions department.

1247
03:39:49,000 --> 03:39:53,159
They're shiny, sharp, and stabby letter openers

1248
03:39:53,159 --> 03:39:55,079
that will definitely help you to escape.

1249
03:39:55,159 --> 03:39:55,959
Distribution center.

1250
03:39:55,959 --> 03:40:02,180
Let's just say that a manifest that said safe, totally harmless, and another manifest that said

1251
03:40:02,180 --> 03:40:04,979
sharp, pointy knives magically got switched around.

1252
03:40:07,350 --> 03:40:08,469
That's hilarious.

1253
03:40:08,469 --> 03:40:10,870
All right, I mailed you a box in the distribution center,

1254
03:40:11,670 --> 03:40:13,899
which is over here.

1255
03:40:13,899 --> 03:40:14,379
Here we go.

1256
03:40:16,780 --> 03:40:18,379
Should I like do more like VR?

1257
03:40:19,100 --> 03:40:21,819
Should I get like really into it and like have you guys see like for instance like,

1258
03:40:22,940 --> 03:40:24,170
it's pretty cool, right?

1259
03:40:24,170 --> 03:40:27,459
Like, it's actually got weight to it.

1260
03:40:29,450 --> 03:40:30,489
Would more viewers be here?

1261
03:40:32,620 --> 03:40:33,659
Might be looking in the right direction.

1262
03:40:36,229 --> 03:40:37,909
All right, distribution center.

1263
03:40:37,909 --> 03:40:40,090
The brush is money than the sword.

1264
03:40:40,090 --> 03:40:41,049
You've seen this already.

1265
03:40:41,770 --> 03:40:47,899
Can't do anything with this.

1266
03:40:48,620 --> 03:40:49,579
Can't do anything with this.

1267
03:40:51,719 --> 03:40:53,879
This is fucking daffy ducks.

1268
03:40:53,879 --> 03:40:55,239
Like three nephews or whatever they are.

1269
03:40:56,280 --> 03:40:58,200
Tweedle-lee, Tweedle-dum, and Tweedle-doo.

1270
03:40:59,639 --> 03:41:00,139
Fuck them.

1271
03:41:01,239 --> 03:41:01,739
All right.

1272
03:41:05,739 --> 03:41:06,379
There's nothing in here.

1273
03:41:06,379 --> 03:41:07,500
Wait, there might be an Easter egg writer.

1274
03:41:11,350 --> 03:41:11,850
No.

1275
03:41:23,370 --> 03:41:24,950
No, nothing in here.

1276
03:41:24,950 --> 03:41:25,510
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1277
03:41:25,510 --> 03:41:26,010
What's that?

1278
03:41:27,270 --> 03:41:36,870
All right, distribution center is over here.

1279
03:41:36,870 --> 03:41:38,629
That's Joan T.C.'s office.

1280
03:41:42,500 --> 03:41:44,500
There's Nikki Hortense.

1281
03:41:45,219 --> 03:41:47,500
But that's not, I don't think going,

1282
03:41:47,500 --> 03:41:49,819
do I have to go into everybody's office and see what they have on the desk?

1283
03:41:55,620 --> 03:41:56,500
Wait, there's a no here.

1284
03:42:01,459 --> 03:42:02,260
Oh my goodness.

1285
03:42:03,780 --> 03:42:07,780
I, dear Nikki, I hope that your travels have brought you new perspective.

1286
03:42:08,739 --> 03:42:10,420
This is too, I can't read it.

1287
03:42:10,420 --> 03:42:11,620
Look, here, just take a screenshot.

1288
03:42:11,620 --> 03:42:12,120
Ready?

1289
03:42:12,819 --> 03:42:15,459
Take a screen cap and then you can read it later.

1290
03:42:16,180 --> 03:42:25,190
All right, let's go.

1291
03:42:33,559 --> 03:42:35,479
Distributions, continue.

1292
03:42:36,979 --> 03:42:37,479
Hello.

1293
03:42:51,239 --> 03:42:53,940
I'm just a bully.

1294
03:42:55,299 --> 03:42:57,260
All right, you need that notebook?

1295
03:42:58,620 --> 03:42:59,659
I just did the magic trick.

1296
03:43:03,510 --> 03:43:04,469
Would that take that?

1297
03:43:05,350 --> 03:43:07,459
Oh no, it's not coming in here.

1298
03:43:07,459 --> 03:43:08,500
Not gonna, no, no, we're good, we're good.

1299
03:43:11,780 --> 03:43:13,700
Two big cans of soda you got here

1300
03:43:16,409 --> 03:43:19,610
that transforms who is Dr. Gimbal Locke.

1301
03:43:24,659 --> 03:43:25,159
Cool.

1302
03:43:25,940 --> 03:43:30,780
All right, this is a secure area.

1303
03:43:31,579 --> 03:43:34,219
Level one key, I got that shit right here.

1304
03:43:34,860 --> 03:43:36,139
Distributions is this way.

1305
03:43:36,940 --> 03:43:45,559
Whoa, he opened the door.

1306
03:43:52,440 --> 03:43:53,479
Holy fuck, man.

1307
03:43:54,520 --> 03:44:01,110
Oh my god, he's gonna shoot me with the gun.

1308
03:44:01,110 --> 03:44:03,430
I thought, yeah, I didn't know he opened the doors.

1309
03:44:04,069 --> 03:44:10,379
So you guys are that way, right?

1310
03:44:10,379 --> 03:44:11,700
We're not.

1311
03:44:11,700 --> 03:44:13,540
You guys are over here?

1312
03:44:14,649 --> 03:44:16,889
No, you guys are this way.

1313
03:44:17,450 --> 03:44:19,819
Hey guys, how are you?

1314
03:44:20,540 --> 03:44:27,379
I wonder what that other thing is for.

1315
03:44:31,670 --> 03:44:35,270
It's in the door.

1316
03:44:42,709 --> 03:44:44,809
Okay, we need to go.

1317
03:44:45,850 --> 03:44:49,700
Right, that doesn't look right at all.

1318
03:44:50,420 --> 03:44:50,979
Where am I?

1319
03:44:53,399 --> 03:44:55,079
What year is it right now?

1320
03:44:55,079 --> 03:44:57,399
57, do I have to call the number again?

1321
03:44:58,280 --> 03:44:59,319
I have to call the number again.

1322
03:45:08,440 --> 03:45:12,969
Oh boy, we're getting some problems here.

1323
03:45:15,530 --> 03:45:16,649
Okay, I'm gonna open these all.

1324
03:45:16,649 --> 03:45:17,450
These are all open, right?

1325
03:45:17,450 --> 03:45:19,450
Get them all open, keep them open

1326
03:45:20,010 --> 03:45:21,209
because they're escape pods.

1327
03:45:21,930 --> 03:45:23,290
They're wasting me to get the hell out of here.

1328
03:45:25,290 --> 03:45:28,120
All right.

1329
03:45:32,170 --> 03:45:33,450
When you feel down, look up.

1330
03:45:35,690 --> 03:45:41,299
Can I not do anything about that?

1331
03:45:48,700 --> 03:45:50,219
All right, let's just get back out here.

1332
03:45:50,219 --> 03:45:51,659
Distribution center, give me that key.

1333
03:45:55,139 --> 03:45:55,860
Get out of the way.

1334
03:46:36,709 --> 03:46:44,680
What is this?

1335
03:46:45,319 --> 03:46:48,329
Did I save this?

1336
03:46:48,969 --> 03:46:51,370
The office, dear friend at the office,

1337
03:46:51,370 --> 03:46:53,450
I'm very happy to be live here on my vacation.

1338
03:46:53,450 --> 03:46:54,329
Please don't look for me.

1339
03:46:55,129 --> 03:46:56,489
Desk 132B.

1340
03:46:57,530 --> 03:47:33,899
He doesn't come down here, does he?

1341
03:47:38,170 --> 03:47:38,969
Does he come in here?

1342
03:48:08,180 --> 03:48:08,500
Shit.

1343
03:48:12,549 --> 03:48:13,110
Distribution.

1344
03:48:16,180 --> 03:48:16,819
All right, I made it.

1345
03:48:20,090 --> 03:48:20,889
Look at the knives.

1346
03:48:21,770 --> 03:48:22,489
Letter openers.

1347
03:48:25,739 --> 03:48:27,020
Hey, excuse me.

1348
03:48:27,739 --> 03:48:30,299
Okay, unbox pens, call mom, smile.

1349
03:48:31,100 --> 03:48:32,790
All right, what is it?

1350
03:48:32,790 --> 03:48:33,190
Up here?

1351
03:48:34,459 --> 03:48:34,780
There?

1352
03:48:41,989 --> 03:48:43,270
1598.

1353
03:48:43,829 --> 03:48:48,819
There's only two?

1354
03:48:50,500 --> 03:48:51,319
How do they work?

1355
03:48:57,180 --> 03:48:58,139
I'm not even holding it right.

1356
03:49:00,950 --> 03:49:03,270
Okay, why do you have like three microwaves up here?

1357
03:49:04,149 --> 03:49:05,030
What is it?

1358
03:49:05,030 --> 03:49:05,989
1598.

1359
03:49:20,819 --> 03:49:27,129
Seems a bit ominous.

1360
03:49:27,129 --> 03:49:27,770
Cybernetics.

1361
03:49:29,290 --> 03:49:29,770
Good luck.

1362
03:49:31,270 --> 03:49:33,510
You and then I have to go to cybernetics.

1363
03:49:33,510 --> 03:49:34,709
Oh, god damn it.

1364
03:49:34,709 --> 03:49:35,510
What did I hit?

1365
03:49:35,510 --> 03:49:36,309
The fucking wall.

1366
03:49:41,860 --> 03:49:42,739
Cybernetics.

1367
03:49:43,860 --> 03:49:46,500
Watch out, okay?

1368
03:49:47,379 --> 03:49:49,299
I'm taking a break.

1369
03:49:50,100 --> 03:49:57,530
I need to locate caffeinated beverage.

1370
03:50:00,420 --> 03:50:00,899
Hello.

1371
03:50:01,940 --> 03:50:02,979
I'm trying to put the head on you,

1372
03:50:02,979 --> 03:50:04,739
like in Skyrim and then steal from me, right?

1373
03:50:04,739 --> 03:50:06,020
That scared me.

1374
03:50:06,020 --> 03:50:06,340
Sorry.

1375
03:50:07,540 --> 03:50:08,760
All right, cybernetics.

1376
03:50:08,760 --> 03:50:09,239
Let's go.

1377
03:50:10,040 --> 03:50:11,540
Well, actually, hold on.

1378
03:50:11,540 --> 03:50:12,020
What's in here?

1379
03:50:13,700 --> 03:50:17,670
Any more letter openers in here?

1380
03:50:17,670 --> 03:50:18,870
That I need to be made aware of?

1381
03:50:22,090 --> 03:50:27,270
What key is that?

1382
03:50:28,149 --> 03:50:28,709
Just locked.

1383
03:50:29,430 --> 03:50:33,219
Got a phone in here though.

1384
03:50:33,780 --> 03:50:36,090
No, same 1598.

1385
03:50:36,090 --> 03:50:36,809
Come on, I need some more.

1386
03:50:36,809 --> 03:50:37,450
Any more letters?

1387
03:50:44,760 --> 03:50:45,639
Not that I can see.

1388
03:50:45,639 --> 03:50:47,000
Let's just go to cybernetics.

1389
03:50:50,889 --> 03:50:52,489
All right, here we go.

1390
03:51:04,260 --> 03:51:06,069
Can I not open this door?

1391
03:51:10,569 --> 03:51:16,899
Uh, I guess we're going over here.

1392
03:51:18,180 --> 03:51:20,780
Well, found them.

1393
03:51:21,659 --> 03:51:27,450
How many knives am I going to need?

1394
03:51:33,690 --> 03:51:34,170
Nice.

1395
03:51:34,170 --> 03:51:36,950
Okay, well, I kind of need all these.

1396
03:51:40,090 --> 03:51:40,409
Wait.

1397
03:51:43,899 --> 03:51:58,440
Oh, shut up.

1398
03:51:58,440 --> 03:51:59,959
All right, so yeah, you can throw the knives.

1399
03:52:04,729 --> 03:52:06,809
The knives actually have weight to them when they move.

1400
03:52:06,809 --> 03:52:07,049
Cool.

1401
03:52:09,620 --> 03:52:10,260
Let me try.

1402
03:52:24,409 --> 03:52:25,209
Cybernetics.

1403
03:52:25,209 --> 03:52:26,889
Let's make our way over there, what do you say?

1404
03:52:31,239 --> 03:52:31,719
Watch out.

1405
03:52:31,719 --> 03:52:32,440
This is one, right?

1406
03:52:32,440 --> 03:52:33,239
Give me that key card.

1407
03:52:33,719 --> 03:52:37,299
You got scissors.

1408
03:52:37,299 --> 03:52:39,819
Can I throw the scissors at somebody?

1409
03:52:40,860 --> 03:52:41,819
I have to be able to, right?

1410
03:52:41,819 --> 03:52:43,340
Like fucking gouge somebody's eyes out.

1411
03:52:44,459 --> 03:52:46,860
I thought that was the actual wall and it scared the fuck out of me.

1412
03:52:47,979 --> 03:52:49,020
I can't take these.

1413
03:52:49,020 --> 03:52:50,250
I'm just going to walk around with them.

1414
03:52:51,049 --> 03:52:51,850
Anything outside?

1415
03:53:02,020 --> 03:53:03,219
No, just keep going.

1416
03:53:05,430 --> 03:53:06,549
I hear somebody moving around.

1417
03:53:10,500 --> 03:53:17,180
There we go, okay.

1418
03:53:27,110 --> 03:53:28,309
There is somebody in here.

1419
03:53:30,120 --> 03:53:31,319
One of those bad guys.

1420
03:53:32,540 --> 03:53:33,579
Uh,

1421
03:53:34,809 --> 03:53:35,129
uh,

1422
03:53:37,319 --> 03:53:39,559
can I throw this at him and hit him in the face and knock him out?

1423
03:53:40,600 --> 03:53:44,790
All right, I'm going back to the first area.

1424
03:53:45,670 --> 03:53:47,979
I'm so confused right now.

1425
03:53:47,979 --> 03:53:48,299
Hold on.

1426
03:53:48,940 --> 03:53:50,219
This is the first area, isn't it?

1427
03:53:50,940 --> 03:53:53,639
I made it back to the first place.

1428
03:54:06,579 --> 03:54:07,379
What the hell happened?

1429
03:54:08,979 --> 03:54:09,379
Did I?

1430
03:54:09,379 --> 03:54:18,760
Did I do it?

1431
03:54:19,639 --> 03:54:23,030
What am I going?

1432
03:54:28,200 --> 03:54:38,379
Okay, I'm still going.

1433
03:54:39,260 --> 03:54:41,420
Okay, there are more knives here.

1434
03:54:42,379 --> 03:54:46,040
I gotta try to throw a knife at somebody, right?

1435
03:54:47,799 --> 03:55:00,780
I gotta hit this guy tonight.

1436
03:55:01,500 --> 03:55:05,209
What's that?

1437
03:55:05,209 --> 03:55:05,850
There's a wall here.

1438
03:55:06,489 --> 03:55:08,500
Back it up, back it up, back it up, back it up.

1439
03:55:08,500 --> 03:55:09,299
There's a wall right there.

1440
03:55:18,840 --> 03:55:23,479
What the fuck is going on down there?

1441
03:55:35,639 --> 03:55:36,280
Wait for him.

1442
03:55:36,280 --> 03:55:36,840
Wait for him.

1443
03:55:38,040 --> 03:55:38,680
Wait for him.

1444
03:56:06,940 --> 03:56:07,979
Hey, thanks buddy.

1445
03:56:09,239 --> 03:56:10,440
I owe you one.

1446
03:56:10,440 --> 03:56:42,200
No, turn the lights off.

1447
03:56:42,520 --> 03:56:58,659
Oh, you hit me right in the face.

1448
03:57:13,540 --> 03:57:14,979
That was a chimpanzee.

1449
03:57:16,020 --> 03:57:18,149
Should have used knives more often.

1450
03:57:18,149 --> 03:57:24,120
Yeah, how's the coal?

1451
03:57:32,100 --> 03:57:33,059
Splinter cell.

1452
03:57:35,899 --> 03:57:38,459
How was your latest session?

1453
03:57:38,459 --> 03:57:39,340
I was pretty sick.

1454
03:57:40,219 --> 03:57:46,819
Not as bad?

1455
03:57:46,819 --> 03:57:49,780
No, I must have acid sweated through the whole thing.

1456
03:57:53,719 --> 03:57:55,000
Angle the camera down.

1457
03:57:55,000 --> 03:57:58,360
What's it when I go like this and I'm like sneaking down?

1458
03:57:59,079 --> 03:58:01,879
If I angle the camera down, then you won't be able to see me when I'm like back here

1459
03:58:01,879 --> 03:58:03,559
or like over here or moving around here.

1460
03:58:06,309 --> 03:58:07,659
All right, I'm gonna give it another tap.

1461
03:58:07,659 --> 03:58:10,219
We're gonna go one more time and then I gotta take a break.

1462
03:58:11,100 --> 03:58:12,440
This is fucking fun though.

1463
03:58:13,670 --> 03:58:14,950
What a blast.

1464
03:58:14,950 --> 03:58:16,229
Virtual reality.

1465
03:58:17,030 --> 03:58:20,200
Turn the webcam sideways.

1466
03:58:20,200 --> 03:58:21,239
I can't like mount it.

1467
03:58:27,299 --> 03:58:28,100
All right, let's do it again.

1468
03:58:28,100 --> 03:58:28,739
One more time.

1469
03:58:28,739 --> 03:58:30,819
Let's see if I can get to at least the end of this little section here.

1470
03:58:30,819 --> 03:58:33,540
There's so much hair is bunching up and it's being ripped out.

1471
03:58:34,260 --> 03:58:34,739
Look at this.

1472
03:58:35,940 --> 03:58:39,780
Okay, remember those infomercials where it was the vacuum that cut your hair?

1473
03:58:40,950 --> 03:58:42,469
If I pull this up, it's all coming out.

1474
03:58:58,790 --> 03:59:00,069
Hey, how's everybody doing?

1475
03:59:00,069 --> 03:59:01,110
How are you?

1476
03:59:01,110 --> 03:59:02,790
Yeah, it's been rough, but it's all right.

1477
03:59:02,790 --> 03:59:03,350
I'm doing all right.

1478
03:59:03,350 --> 03:59:03,829
I'm doing good.

1479
03:59:04,729 --> 03:59:05,370
How are you doing?

1480
03:59:05,370 --> 03:59:06,090
How's everything going?

1481
03:59:06,090 --> 03:59:06,649
How are the kids?

1482
03:59:08,280 --> 03:59:11,479
Yeah, I'm like the guy that screens the people under the bridge now.

1483
03:59:11,479 --> 03:59:12,360
You know, that's what I do.

1484
03:59:13,000 --> 03:59:15,399
It's been real, you know, just get the job done.

1485
03:59:16,489 --> 03:59:16,969
Ow.

1486
03:59:16,969 --> 03:59:37,059
I'm gonna have to take a hose to this.

1487
03:59:45,299 --> 03:59:47,700
My poor hair was already struggling.

1488
03:59:48,260 --> 03:59:49,219
It's just gonna come out.

1489
03:59:49,860 --> 03:59:52,500
All right, let me get like a little sip of this, uh, just drink

1490
03:59:52,500 --> 03:59:53,540
and we'll try it one more time.

1491
03:59:57,159 --> 03:59:58,520
He thinks he's streaming.

1492
04:00:05,750 --> 04:00:10,139
So I see that there have been barely any drop frames in about

1493
04:00:10,860 --> 04:00:11,260
four hours.

1494
04:00:11,260 --> 04:00:12,299
So that's, that's a good sign.

1495
04:00:18,329 --> 04:00:19,770
He's been a patient.

1496
04:00:19,770 --> 04:00:22,090
Thinks he's in a stream in VR.

1497
04:00:22,969 --> 04:00:31,530
I need to get like a beanie or a goddamn haircut would do too.

1498
04:00:32,170 --> 04:00:40,069
All right, let's get back in.

1499
04:00:40,069 --> 04:00:43,819
I'll do one more death or one more attempt.

1500
04:00:53,940 --> 04:00:58,329
So tomorrow there's more.

1501
04:00:59,209 --> 04:01:02,899
I gotta think of a situation to untangle this fucking cord.

1502
04:01:03,940 --> 04:01:09,559
I'm gonna have to figure out a solution.

1503
04:01:10,280 --> 04:01:11,770
Is this left or right?

1504
04:01:16,069 --> 04:01:20,940
Okay, this one is left.

1505
04:01:23,020 --> 04:01:24,700
I expect you to die.

1506
04:01:27,100 --> 04:01:29,670
Well, I expect you to die.

1507
04:01:30,549 --> 04:01:33,030
It's not, it's the wrong game.

1508
04:01:33,590 --> 04:01:39,159
What's happening here?

1509
04:01:41,559 --> 04:01:42,040
Oh, right.

1510
04:01:46,180 --> 04:01:49,190
One, two, don't touch that one.

1511
04:01:49,829 --> 04:01:58,170
So the object, I might have it all the way back.

1512
04:01:58,170 --> 04:01:59,770
No, I have to be like a checkpoint or something, right?

1513
04:02:00,569 --> 04:02:03,079
No, this is perfect.

1514
04:02:03,079 --> 04:02:04,040
All right, I'm in a good spot.

1515
04:02:05,420 --> 04:02:08,659
I have, let's knife this motherfucker.

1516
04:02:10,459 --> 04:02:12,139
I'm not even gonna be scared about this.

1517
04:02:12,780 --> 04:02:13,659
Do you think I'm scared?

1518
04:02:18,469 --> 04:02:19,829
What are you gonna do about that one?

1519
04:02:34,950 --> 04:02:36,709
He's just like pissing over here.

1520
04:02:37,030 --> 04:02:37,670
No, that doesn't count.

1521
04:02:37,670 --> 04:02:38,549
That didn't count.

1522
04:02:38,549 --> 04:02:39,190
That didn't count.

1523
04:02:43,260 --> 04:02:44,700
He was just letting it ride over here.

1524
04:02:54,739 --> 04:02:55,459
Okay, we're back in.

1525
04:02:56,260 --> 04:02:57,459
Do it again.

1526
04:03:05,020 --> 04:03:06,219
I gotta hit him right in the face.

1527
04:03:10,629 --> 04:03:11,430
Right in the face.

1528
04:03:16,540 --> 04:03:22,719
Do it again.

1529
04:03:26,469 --> 04:03:28,149
I'll do another, I'll throw a second one.

1530
04:03:38,440 --> 04:03:40,739
Please wait, please wait.

1531
04:03:59,399 --> 04:04:00,280
Give me that knife back.

1532
04:04:04,680 --> 04:04:05,180
What?

1533
04:04:05,239 --> 04:04:05,739
Oh.

1534
04:04:07,079 --> 04:04:07,579
Okay.

1535
04:04:08,200 --> 04:04:09,079
I'm making it through.

1536
04:04:27,129 --> 04:04:28,489
I didn't get fucking caught here.

1537
04:04:34,780 --> 04:04:36,059
Where's the wall?

1538
04:04:36,139 --> 04:04:37,579
Make sure I'm not touching a fucking wall.

1539
04:04:40,809 --> 04:04:42,600
Why did I just kill that?

1540
04:04:42,600 --> 04:04:43,879
Why did I do that to that guy?

1541
04:04:44,680 --> 04:05:24,120
This one's gotta count.

1542
04:05:31,350 --> 04:05:37,610
I'm freezing.

1543
04:05:40,329 --> 04:05:41,850
No, why did I do that?

1544
04:05:41,850 --> 04:05:46,069
He could have talked.

1545
04:05:46,069 --> 04:05:47,110
Okay, he could have talked.

1546
04:05:47,829 --> 04:06:08,489
One, five, nine, eight.

1547
04:06:08,489 --> 04:06:09,129
No, not yet.

1548
04:06:18,899 --> 04:06:20,739
That's two, I need two little two.

1549
04:06:23,030 --> 04:06:24,790
Work hard, get one access.

1550
04:06:25,670 --> 04:06:26,950
Everybody have like a key card over here?

1551
04:06:28,950 --> 04:06:34,170
Can I get in that?

1552
04:06:34,170 --> 04:06:35,530
No, I can't get in the production thing.

1553
04:06:42,309 --> 04:06:42,809
Stop that.

1554
04:06:43,510 --> 04:06:46,649
Maybe go back up?

1555
04:06:47,610 --> 04:06:48,889
Let me just check some desks.

1556
04:06:49,690 --> 04:06:59,079
If you go in here.

1557
04:07:15,479 --> 04:07:23,420
I guess I'm gonna go back up.

1558
04:07:25,399 --> 04:07:34,600
Was I back here yet?

1559
04:07:35,479 --> 04:07:37,299
I don't think I was back here yet.

1560
04:07:38,260 --> 04:07:40,780
Somebody's desk?

1561
04:07:40,780 --> 04:07:41,899
Anybody got level two in here?

1562
04:07:43,420 --> 04:07:46,459
Oh, that's where you find the money.

1563
04:07:53,340 --> 04:07:54,219
Beautiful.

1564
04:07:54,219 --> 04:07:55,420
Level two.

1565
04:07:55,420 --> 04:08:02,950
I'm gonna go for like a bouncing shot here.

1566
04:08:04,299 --> 04:08:05,100
Just like that.

1567
04:08:05,100 --> 04:08:06,059
All right, back down.

1568
04:08:06,059 --> 04:08:07,020
Where is it? Over here, right?

1569
04:08:07,979 --> 04:08:12,659
I'll get that later.

1570
04:08:13,379 --> 04:08:14,680
Level two.

1571
04:08:15,239 --> 04:08:19,049
Is there a wall?

1572
04:08:19,049 --> 04:08:19,530
Yeah, there is.

1573
04:08:19,530 --> 04:08:19,930
Be careful.

1574
04:08:20,729 --> 04:08:22,120
All right.

1575
04:08:31,159 --> 04:08:41,590
Gotta be prepared for this shit.

1576
04:08:41,590 --> 04:08:42,549
I'm almost out of this.

1577
04:08:48,940 --> 04:08:58,020
You can see me through the portal.

1578
04:09:25,299 --> 04:09:25,860
Fuck you!

1579
04:09:39,420 --> 04:09:41,399
Oh no, he's alive?

1580
04:09:42,760 --> 04:10:09,479
That it?

1581
04:10:10,670 --> 04:10:14,989
I don't mind if I do.

1582
04:10:16,889 --> 04:10:23,579
That was just fucking mean.

1583
04:10:27,100 --> 04:10:27,600
Hey!

1584
04:10:35,739 --> 04:10:40,399
Don't kill them.

1585
04:10:40,399 --> 04:10:42,799
Just put them up.

1586
04:10:42,799 --> 04:10:43,520
I'm gonna need these.

1587
04:10:44,159 --> 04:10:45,120
I'm gonna need these later.

1588
04:10:51,440 --> 04:10:53,120
Meeting room bull.

1589
04:10:54,459 --> 04:10:55,340
Meeting room bull.

1590
04:10:57,360 --> 04:10:58,079
Something going on?

1591
04:10:58,079 --> 04:10:59,200
Is something happening here?

1592
04:10:59,200 --> 04:10:59,760
Hang in there.

1593
04:11:03,600 --> 04:11:07,229
Well, that sure is them.

1594
04:11:09,450 --> 04:11:10,729
We may need to move out of the way.

1595
04:11:11,530 --> 04:11:12,409
All right, so what we got?

1596
04:11:13,209 --> 04:11:21,000
We went through the front door.

1597
04:11:59,420 --> 04:12:00,299
Oh, come on!

1598
04:12:00,860 --> 04:12:15,440
I was trying to be so careful, too.

1599
04:12:15,440 --> 04:12:16,000
Where's the knives?

1600
04:12:16,000 --> 04:12:16,559
I just put them on.

1601
04:12:16,559 --> 04:12:18,239
It feels like a good day for a good day.

1602
04:12:19,120 --> 04:12:26,680
Should I go on over?

1603
04:12:26,680 --> 04:12:27,319
No, I don't.

1604
04:12:27,319 --> 04:12:30,000
I don't know what the fuck is going on.

1605
04:12:30,000 --> 04:12:35,639
I'm gonna hit that one over there

1606
04:12:35,639 --> 04:12:36,760
a shitload of times.

1607
04:12:37,399 --> 04:12:40,520
I need like a better solution to that.

1608
04:12:40,520 --> 04:12:42,360
I'm gonna have to move my lighthouses, I think.

1609
04:12:43,000 --> 04:12:44,680
Because I'm gonna fucking break that thing.

1610
04:12:46,280 --> 04:12:51,920
Okay, here we go.

1611
04:12:52,639 --> 04:13:00,799
Electricity, electricity, electricity.

1612
04:13:00,799 --> 04:13:01,360
What's in here?

1613
04:13:05,690 --> 04:13:07,399
Uh, huh.

1614
04:13:09,440 --> 04:13:10,000
Well, shit.

1615
04:13:10,479 --> 04:13:10,719
Hmm.

1616
04:13:12,760 --> 04:13:14,120
Maybe I have to go down this.

1617
04:13:14,120 --> 04:13:15,159
Should I go down here?

1618
04:13:19,899 --> 04:13:20,780
I'm just gonna go down here.

1619
04:13:21,579 --> 04:13:21,979
Fuck it.

1620
04:13:28,399 --> 04:13:29,600
Two, three, thirty.

1621
04:13:30,319 --> 04:13:32,059
The phone's ringing.

1622
04:13:39,260 --> 04:13:40,079
Really?

1623
04:13:46,719 --> 04:13:47,840
In the dog dog.

1624
04:13:47,840 --> 04:13:48,559
In the doggy door.

1625
04:13:50,059 --> 04:13:51,260
I made it in the doggy door, but.

1626
04:13:52,540 --> 04:13:53,260
Yeah, hello?

1627
04:13:58,360 --> 04:13:59,159
I admit it.

1628
04:13:59,159 --> 04:14:00,600
I knew this would happen.

1629
04:14:00,600 --> 04:14:04,440
I mean, you're holding a very valuable stolen prototype.

1630
04:14:04,440 --> 04:14:05,399
Mm-hmm, yeah.

1631
04:14:05,399 --> 04:14:06,280
Oh, don't get mad, okay?

1632
04:14:06,280 --> 04:14:08,520
I needed you to understand how bad things were here.

1633
04:14:09,319 --> 04:14:13,309
I need your help to find out what's going on.

1634
04:14:14,030 --> 04:14:15,629
Get a level three access card,

1635
04:14:15,629 --> 04:14:18,590
take the elevator, and find someone called April.

1636
04:14:18,590 --> 04:14:20,510
Her desk is in the production department.

1637
04:14:20,510 --> 04:14:23,549
Now, if you help me, I promise to help you escape.

1638
04:14:23,549 --> 04:14:24,510
Now, if you help me, I promise to help you escape.

1639
04:14:24,510 --> 04:14:25,309
Hank, you swear it.

1640
04:14:30,280 --> 04:14:31,959
Company to the pat-down station in the lobby.

1641
04:14:32,040 --> 04:14:34,680
Company will probably become a guest key in the lobby, whatever.

1642
04:14:34,680 --> 04:14:36,360
All right, so I gotta get a level three card,

1643
04:14:36,360 --> 04:14:37,879
and then I gotta go level fucking three,

1644
04:14:37,879 --> 04:14:39,639
and I gotta go level three, get a level three card,

1645
04:14:39,639 --> 04:14:40,520
and then get out of here.

1646
04:14:40,520 --> 04:14:41,799
Go and get out.

1647
04:14:44,379 --> 04:14:47,180
Sounds not easy enough,

1648
04:14:47,180 --> 04:14:49,899
but probably simple enough where it'll happen eventually.

1649
04:14:49,899 --> 04:14:50,540
What's over here?

1650
04:14:51,819 --> 04:14:53,450
It's locked.

1651
04:14:54,090 --> 04:14:54,489
That's it.

1652
04:14:54,489 --> 04:14:55,850
Okay, there's the elevator right there.

1653
04:14:55,850 --> 04:14:56,649
I need a level three card.

1654
04:14:56,649 --> 04:14:57,290
I gotta go in there.

1655
04:15:17,469 --> 04:15:22,489
What am I fucking running into?

1656
04:15:27,930 --> 04:15:28,729
There's a gun.

1657
04:16:14,620 --> 04:16:15,420
How do I use this?

1658
04:16:16,379 --> 04:16:41,120
Can I use this thing?

1659
04:16:43,209 --> 04:16:43,930
Can I use this?

1660
04:17:04,479 --> 04:17:08,430
All right, I got the card.

1661
04:17:08,430 --> 04:17:09,069
Let's go to the...

1662
04:17:10,670 --> 04:17:14,079
Let's get out of here.

1663
04:17:14,079 --> 04:17:14,639
Level three.

1664
04:17:15,440 --> 04:17:23,309
Let's go.

1665
04:17:23,950 --> 04:17:37,420
I did it.

1666
04:17:37,420 --> 04:17:37,819
I don't...

1667
04:17:37,819 --> 04:17:39,500
I only need the level three card.

1668
04:17:39,500 --> 04:17:51,260
It does everything the lower ones already do.

1669
04:17:51,979 --> 04:18:01,520
All right, let's go.

1670
04:18:03,100 --> 04:18:05,690
You've been in for too long.

1671
04:18:05,690 --> 04:18:06,409
No, no, I'm all right.

1672
04:18:06,409 --> 04:18:07,049
I'm going back in.

1673
04:18:07,049 --> 04:18:07,930
I'm going back in.

1674
04:18:07,930 --> 04:18:09,420
I'll be just fine.

1675
04:18:09,420 --> 04:18:09,979
Don't worry about me.

1676
04:18:09,979 --> 04:18:10,860
I'm gonna go back in.

1677
04:18:10,860 --> 04:18:14,760
Jeremy, you haven't shown up to work.

1678
04:18:15,319 --> 04:18:16,360
I'm going back in.

1679
04:18:16,360 --> 04:18:19,629
Jeremy, your school called.

1680
04:18:19,629 --> 04:18:20,190
That's all right.

1681
04:18:20,190 --> 04:18:25,180
I'm just gonna go back in for like another five minutes.

1682
04:18:25,180 --> 04:18:28,700
Jeremy, you haven't eaten in fucking two days.

1683
04:18:28,700 --> 04:18:29,180
That's all right.

1684
04:18:29,180 --> 04:18:29,979
I'm just gonna go back in.

1685
04:18:34,299 --> 04:18:34,620
Hey.

1686
04:18:41,979 --> 04:18:42,459
No number?

1687
04:18:43,500 --> 04:18:44,780
None of his company.

1688
04:18:44,780 --> 04:18:47,579
And he knows to work anywhere other than...

1689
04:18:47,579 --> 04:18:48,780
Oh, that hurt my head.

1690
04:18:54,489 --> 04:18:55,290
Can I use this?

1691
04:18:55,290 --> 04:18:55,690
Do I need to...

1692
04:18:58,729 --> 04:18:59,129
That way.

1693
04:19:02,479 --> 04:19:03,040
No.

1694
04:19:03,040 --> 04:19:03,840
8008.

1695
04:19:03,840 --> 04:19:04,719
Hello, you're listening.

1696
04:19:04,719 --> 04:19:06,799
I am very busy with my tax.

1697
04:19:06,799 --> 04:19:07,840
Backspot is broken.

1698
04:19:07,840 --> 04:19:09,760
Use John Smith's machine instead.

1699
04:19:10,559 --> 04:19:16,350
What the fuck is the number?

1700
04:19:16,350 --> 04:19:17,149
8008.

1701
04:19:20,159 --> 04:19:21,280
No, 8000.

1702
04:19:23,719 --> 04:19:47,600
I don't like this office.

1703
04:19:47,600 --> 04:19:48,959
I'm not coming into work tomorrow.

1704
04:19:50,809 --> 04:19:51,770
John Smith's office.

1705
04:19:52,409 --> 04:19:54,090
Let me in.

1706
04:19:55,280 --> 04:19:56,959
Map of pre-production department.

1707
04:19:57,760 --> 04:19:59,040
John Smith fax room.

1708
04:19:59,040 --> 04:19:59,680
Elevated lobby.

1709
04:19:59,680 --> 04:20:01,040
Mess hall production department.

1710
04:20:01,040 --> 04:20:02,000
Auxiliary.

1711
04:20:02,559 --> 04:20:03,040
John's.

1712
04:20:04,399 --> 04:20:05,739
Hello?

1713
04:20:15,420 --> 04:20:33,799
There's a wall.

1714
04:20:33,799 --> 04:20:34,360
Where's the wall?

1715
04:21:07,629 --> 04:21:11,229
Excuse me.

1716
04:21:11,790 --> 04:21:16,079
I need that back.

1717
04:21:23,229 --> 04:21:23,709
Uh-oh.

1718
04:21:28,000 --> 04:21:28,319
What?

1719
04:21:28,319 --> 04:21:28,799
Hey, what?

1720
04:21:52,969 --> 04:21:53,690
Who shot?

1721
04:21:54,250 --> 04:22:00,540
Who shot?

1722
04:22:00,540 --> 04:22:01,420
Is everybody behind me?

1723
04:22:01,979 --> 04:22:09,979
Who's behind me?

1724
04:22:09,979 --> 04:22:13,770
All right.

1725
04:22:13,770 --> 04:22:18,780
I think it's time to take a break.

1726
04:22:18,780 --> 04:22:19,579
Oh.

1727
04:22:19,579 --> 04:22:21,469
I'm having too much fun, but I gotta like...

1728
04:22:21,469 --> 04:22:22,750
I gotta like fucking rest my eyes.

1729
04:22:28,409 --> 04:22:28,969
Rage quit?

1730
04:22:28,969 --> 04:22:29,450
No, no.

1731
04:22:29,930 --> 04:22:31,770
I'll probably start with this tomorrow.

1732
04:22:31,770 --> 04:22:33,770
There's so many VR games though.

1733
04:22:33,770 --> 04:22:38,329
Oh, there's so many VR games that I have to play.

1734
04:22:41,239 --> 04:22:42,520
So we're gonna be tomorrow.

1735
04:22:43,239 --> 04:22:45,399
I'll see you guys tomorrow with more VR.

1736
04:22:46,040 --> 04:22:48,079
So we're gonna go three days in a row.

1737
04:22:48,079 --> 04:22:49,120
Just because I'm 1-0.

1738
04:22:52,030 --> 04:22:52,670
I mentioned like...

1739
04:22:53,899 --> 04:22:57,420
You can't even take me seriously with this like fucking toupee.

1740
04:22:58,540 --> 04:23:01,040
Oh my god.

1741
04:23:01,040 --> 04:23:02,559
Let's get a real talk going here, guys.

1742
04:23:04,040 --> 04:23:06,760
It's like this is a toupee they used to wear back in like the fucking...

1743
04:23:07,479 --> 04:23:08,680
It's 1800.

1744
04:23:13,840 --> 04:23:16,459
I gotta go get like food and just relax for a little bit.

1745
04:23:16,459 --> 04:23:17,420
It's like a couple hours.

1746
04:23:17,979 --> 04:23:21,340
I can only stay inside these things for like four to five hours

1747
04:23:21,340 --> 04:23:23,260
before like I gotta get away from it.

1748
04:23:24,299 --> 04:23:26,780
So tomorrow we're gonna pick up again.

1749
04:23:27,500 --> 04:23:30,409
We're gonna do more VR tomorrow.

1750
04:23:33,559 --> 04:23:37,959
So I will see you guys tomorrow

1751
04:23:37,959 --> 04:23:39,879
around three to four p.m. Pacific.

1752
04:23:40,440 --> 04:23:42,639
Get the camera out of here.

1753
04:23:43,200 --> 04:23:46,600
I doubt I could even go that long.

1754
04:23:47,479 --> 04:23:48,440
It really depends on the day.

1755
04:23:49,159 --> 04:23:52,489
Sometimes it's like one hour is enough for me to have to stop.

1756
04:23:52,489 --> 04:23:53,610
Sometimes like four to five.

1757
04:23:56,120 --> 04:23:57,079
It's still in the game.

1758
04:23:57,079 --> 04:23:58,440
Yeah, it saves it, right?

1759
04:23:59,000 --> 04:24:00,840
Don't have to do anything in particular to save the game.

1760
04:24:07,360 --> 04:24:08,159
That was a blast.

1761
04:24:09,520 --> 04:24:10,639
I'm very satisfied.

1762
04:24:17,479 --> 04:24:20,520
Kiwo can stream VR for like 13 hours straight.

1763
04:24:20,520 --> 04:24:21,399
Oh my god.

1764
04:24:22,889 --> 04:24:23,209
How?

1765
04:24:24,239 --> 04:24:25,360
How is it possible?

1766
04:24:30,139 --> 04:24:36,700
13 hours in the helmet?

1767
04:24:36,700 --> 04:24:40,120
Yeah, first impressions of Vibe is absolutely worth the money.

1768
04:24:40,120 --> 04:24:41,239
It was a blast.

1769
04:24:41,239 --> 04:24:44,940
I just I need to like take a few hours after that

1770
04:24:44,940 --> 04:24:46,620
and just kind of get my eyes off of it.

1771
04:24:49,739 --> 04:24:51,100
But tomorrow we're gonna pick up again.

1772
04:24:52,120 --> 04:24:53,000
I'll see you tomorrow.

1773
04:24:57,040 --> 04:24:57,600
More VR.

1774
04:24:57,600 --> 04:24:58,719
I'm gonna get some more games.

1775
04:24:58,719 --> 04:25:00,639
I'm gonna get some Beat Saber stuff.

1776
04:25:04,750 --> 04:25:06,270
But I'm tapped out for now.

1777
04:25:08,250 --> 04:25:09,530
By the moving sea.

1778
04:25:11,819 --> 04:25:13,819
This Discord link.

1779
04:25:13,819 --> 04:25:15,420
This coal miner link.

1780
04:25:18,430 --> 04:25:23,340
That's so stupid.

1781
04:25:27,559 --> 04:25:28,680
I'll see you tomorrow.

1782
04:25:28,680 --> 04:25:29,799
We got some bits to go through.

1783
04:25:32,360 --> 04:25:33,559
I'm gonna try a different...

1784
04:25:33,559 --> 04:25:34,920
I might move the lighthouses

1785
04:25:34,920 --> 04:25:36,360
because I don't want to break these things.

1786
04:25:38,250 --> 04:25:41,770
And I hit the lighthouse on the back portion of the room twice.

1787
04:25:45,500 --> 04:25:46,459
So see you tomorrow.

1788
04:25:47,659 --> 04:25:48,940
Let's get the outro on here.

1789
04:25:48,940 --> 04:25:49,979
Let's take that off.

1790
04:25:50,620 --> 04:25:53,389
Thank you for joining me.

1791
04:25:55,850 --> 04:25:57,930
What do you say we go down here?

1792
04:25:58,489 --> 04:26:05,930
Move as far as I can to the corner.

1793
04:26:06,010 --> 04:26:09,290
Yeah, the only problem is I have a big L-shaped desk.

1794
04:26:11,200 --> 04:26:12,079
And the desk is...

1795
04:26:14,000 --> 04:26:17,520
It kind of takes up a large portion of the back and left wall.

1796
04:26:18,559 --> 04:26:20,000
So trying to get the lighthouses...

1797
04:26:20,000 --> 04:26:22,399
I mean the room is big enough to do it.

1798
04:26:22,399 --> 04:26:24,319
And obviously I was taking at least

1799
04:26:25,440 --> 04:26:25,920
what?

1800
04:26:25,920 --> 04:26:28,399
Two or three steps in any given direction without hitting a wall.

1801
04:26:32,360 --> 04:26:33,399
Why do my knees hurt?

1802
04:26:34,750 --> 04:26:36,750
I have like red raw knees.

1803
04:26:36,750 --> 04:26:37,250
What?

1804
04:26:38,040 --> 04:26:38,540
Why?

1805
04:26:45,069 --> 04:26:46,110
Oh, it's from crawling around.

1806
04:26:48,200 --> 04:26:51,239
All right, so let's start a few...

1807
04:26:51,239 --> 04:26:52,760
Let's see, about four and a half hours ago.

1808
04:26:53,639 --> 04:26:56,680
We had a ton of gifted subs that came from Guild Hero.

1809
04:26:56,680 --> 04:26:58,360
I'm not sure if you still hear Guild Hero, but thank you.

1810
04:26:59,159 --> 04:27:02,280
There's like at least 25 to 30 gifted subs here.

1811
04:27:02,280 --> 04:27:02,840
Thanks a lot.

1812
04:27:08,520 --> 04:27:09,159
Yeah, I laid...

1813
04:27:09,159 --> 04:27:10,120
I did lie on the ground.

1814
04:27:10,760 --> 04:27:12,649
But thank you so much Guild Hero.

1815
04:27:14,219 --> 04:27:15,180
Let's start back here.

1816
04:27:19,440 --> 04:27:20,159
We had...

1817
04:27:22,079 --> 04:27:23,600
Hey Alec, thanks for the one dollar.

1818
04:27:24,319 --> 04:27:27,200
I got the starry night night sky shirt and it's epic.

1819
04:27:28,680 --> 04:27:30,200
Yeah, it's a great shirt.

1820
04:27:30,200 --> 04:27:31,000
I highly recommend it.

1821
04:27:33,389 --> 04:27:34,670
If you don't know what I'm talking about,

1822
04:27:34,670 --> 04:27:36,590
if you just have a teespring store,

1823
04:27:37,229 --> 04:27:38,270
a couple of shirts are there.

1824
04:27:38,270 --> 04:27:40,030
If you feel like buying them, cool.

1825
04:27:41,149 --> 04:27:42,270
They're very, very well made.

1826
04:27:42,270 --> 04:27:42,829
They're very...

1827
04:27:42,829 --> 04:27:43,950
The designs are very good.

1828
04:27:45,120 --> 04:27:45,920
It is available.

1829
04:27:46,559 --> 04:27:52,379
Wow, we just went to zero.

1830
04:27:52,940 --> 04:27:55,719
That was like a full-on zero.

1831
04:27:56,520 --> 04:27:58,379
Damn, okay.

1832
04:27:58,379 --> 04:28:00,299
Well, refresh, I guess.

1833
04:28:00,299 --> 04:28:00,860
That was weird.

1834
04:28:02,750 --> 04:28:04,270
But yeah, the shirts are available.

1835
04:28:04,270 --> 04:28:04,829
They're really cool.

1836
04:28:05,709 --> 04:28:07,680
I highly recommend them.

1837
04:28:09,659 --> 04:28:11,100
Thank you, sad Vega, for the one dollar.

1838
04:28:11,100 --> 04:28:13,979
So I did the idiot remark at Taco Bell while ordering food.

1839
04:28:14,540 --> 04:28:17,100
I said, I'll have a cheese Gordita Crunch, idiot.

1840
04:28:17,100 --> 04:28:18,620
They looked at me for a second in shock.

1841
04:28:19,260 --> 04:28:20,700
Then I repeated it and the manager came

1842
04:28:20,700 --> 04:28:23,420
and told me to apologize and leave or he'd call the police.

1843
04:28:23,420 --> 04:28:25,899
I apologized profusely and blamed you,

1844
04:28:26,620 --> 04:28:28,780
saying you were encouraging people to do it.

1845
04:28:28,780 --> 04:28:29,659
He looked at me and said,

1846
04:28:29,659 --> 04:28:31,979
if he told you to jump off a bridge, would you?

1847
04:28:31,979 --> 04:28:32,700
And I said, yes.

1848
04:28:35,930 --> 04:28:37,290
Here's the thing though.

1849
04:28:37,290 --> 04:28:40,569
I explicitly told everybody not to do that.

1850
04:28:40,809 --> 04:28:42,250
Because it was incredibly rude

1851
04:28:43,049 --> 04:28:45,209
and it wasn't a nice thing to do.

1852
04:28:46,010 --> 04:28:51,239
Sorry to hear that you got reprimanded at Taco Bell

1853
04:28:51,239 --> 04:28:56,360
for being what any normal person would see as being a dick.

1854
04:28:57,979 --> 04:28:59,020
But thank you for the one dollar.

1855
04:29:01,260 --> 04:29:02,860
Raise and rise, thanks for the three bucks.

1856
04:29:03,579 --> 04:29:04,780
Divus, thanks for the two bucks.

1857
04:29:05,979 --> 04:29:07,340
Dork Cube, thanks for the one dollar.

1858
04:29:07,340 --> 04:29:10,139
My dad always said, measure twice, cut once.

1859
04:29:10,139 --> 04:29:12,379
But this stream proved that sometimes,

1860
04:29:12,379 --> 04:29:13,739
even when you measure 10 times,

1861
04:29:13,739 --> 04:29:15,500
you may still slice your finger off.

1862
04:29:20,889 --> 04:29:22,889
I'm getting a feel for the room too.

1863
04:29:22,889 --> 04:29:24,409
Because remember, this is the first time

1864
04:29:25,610 --> 04:29:29,559
I've ever experienced VR, standing up with a Vive.

1865
04:29:29,559 --> 04:29:31,879
My only real experience was PSVR

1866
04:29:31,879 --> 04:29:34,440
and I had to stand in the same spot.

1867
04:29:34,440 --> 04:29:36,670
So you guys just, you guys watched live

1868
04:29:36,670 --> 04:29:40,110
my first real ever like room VR experience.

1869
04:29:40,110 --> 04:29:42,120
So you kind of have to get used to it.

1870
04:29:42,120 --> 04:29:46,959
Do I still have PSVR?

1871
04:29:46,959 --> 04:29:47,440
I do not.

1872
04:29:48,250 --> 04:29:49,930
I actually gave it to a friend.

1873
04:29:50,569 --> 04:29:52,620
So I no longer have access to it.

1874
04:29:52,620 --> 04:29:53,579
But now I have a Vive.

1875
04:29:53,579 --> 04:29:57,920
So there's really no reason I don't think I have it.

1876
04:29:58,479 --> 04:30:00,879
There are a few PSVR exclusives that look interesting.

1877
04:30:00,879 --> 04:30:02,940
But I have a Vive.

1878
04:30:02,940 --> 04:30:05,100
So anytime I want to do VR, I'm just going to use that.

1879
04:30:05,819 --> 04:30:08,760
But thank you, Dork Cube.

1880
04:30:08,760 --> 04:30:09,319
Good advice.

1881
04:30:10,350 --> 04:30:12,110
Superintendent Chalmers, thanks for the one dollar.

1882
04:30:12,670 --> 04:30:16,479
Andy say, hey, Jeremy, can you do a stream

1883
04:30:16,479 --> 04:30:17,680
where you just watch Willem Dafoe

1884
04:30:17,680 --> 04:30:19,120
talk about himself for 30 minutes?

1885
04:30:20,000 --> 04:30:27,530
Always eclipses the movie itself.

1886
04:30:27,690 --> 04:30:30,090
Willem Dafoe breaks down his most iconic character

1887
04:30:30,090 --> 04:30:31,209
for 35 minutes.

1888
04:30:35,770 --> 04:30:39,799
Well, no, 35 minutes.

1889
04:30:41,870 --> 04:30:43,309
I would watch that on your own time.

1890
04:30:43,309 --> 04:30:43,950
That's probably great.

1891
04:30:44,590 --> 04:30:46,270
He's one of the greatest actors we've ever seen.

1892
04:30:49,020 --> 04:30:50,299
But thank you, Superintendent Chalmers.

1893
04:30:50,299 --> 04:30:52,459
Thank you, Deviant XS for the one dollar.

1894
04:30:52,459 --> 04:30:54,940
Might be a good idea to put some straps on, bro.

1895
04:30:56,750 --> 04:30:58,829
Smashly, thanks for the four community subs earlier.

1896
04:30:59,469 --> 04:31:00,670
Tingy, thanks for the one dollar.

1897
04:31:01,389 --> 04:31:03,709
You had us in the first half of the most fun thing

1898
04:31:03,709 --> 04:31:05,870
you've ever done until you mentioned

1899
04:31:05,870 --> 04:31:06,989
riding roller coasters.

1900
04:31:06,989 --> 04:31:08,989
Everyone knows you must be this tall to ride.

1901
04:31:14,639 --> 04:31:17,680
You know that you could be like 48 inches tall

1902
04:31:18,729 --> 04:31:21,770
and still qualify for like the Superman ride of steel.

1903
04:31:23,319 --> 04:31:23,959
You know that, right?

1904
04:31:24,600 --> 04:31:28,010
So even if I was like four foot six,

1905
04:31:28,729 --> 04:31:30,809
I would still qualify for the Superman ride.

1906
04:31:33,659 --> 04:31:34,299
That's not true.

1907
04:31:34,299 --> 04:31:34,860
What are you talking about?

1908
04:31:38,190 --> 04:31:40,510
Five goddamn eight, five nine with heels on.

1909
04:31:42,559 --> 04:31:44,159
Thank you, trust no one for the three bucks.

1910
04:31:44,719 --> 04:31:45,870
Hello, Jeremy.

1911
04:31:45,870 --> 04:31:46,430
It's me again.

1912
04:31:46,430 --> 04:31:49,389
Last time we met, I was kind of obliged

1913
04:31:49,389 --> 04:31:51,870
to follow the same road as I had before.

1914
04:31:51,870 --> 04:31:52,750
That's all because of you.

1915
04:31:52,750 --> 04:31:54,670
Let's see where this road leads us this time.

1916
04:31:55,469 --> 04:31:57,610
Let's see where this road leads us.

1917
04:32:01,360 --> 04:32:04,639
This is 11 scariest germs caught by drones.

1918
04:32:07,100 --> 04:32:10,510
What the fuck is this?

1919
04:32:12,110 --> 04:32:14,159
Hold on.

1920
04:32:14,159 --> 04:32:14,639
I got to play it.

1921
04:32:15,840 --> 04:32:18,920
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1922
04:32:18,920 --> 04:32:22,750
Let me see.

1923
04:32:22,750 --> 04:32:25,850
Is Willem Dafoe's video still playing?

1924
04:32:28,680 --> 04:32:29,719
Oh, I see what's going on.

1925
04:32:29,719 --> 04:32:31,799
Okay, I have to get the HTC Vive.

1926
04:32:32,600 --> 04:32:35,229
I'm going to go to my regular speakers.

1927
04:32:35,229 --> 04:32:35,790
Okay, there we go.

1928
04:32:39,000 --> 04:32:42,110
Now this should be playing, right?

1929
04:32:42,110 --> 04:32:45,520
Shit, why can I not hear this?

1930
04:32:49,100 --> 04:32:51,020
Yeah, the Vive kind of takes over your whole setup.

1931
04:32:51,020 --> 04:32:53,340
It takes over your mic, takes over your headphones.

1932
04:32:54,219 --> 04:32:57,680
Let me just put this back to get that better.

1933
04:33:02,520 --> 04:33:03,079
There we go.

1934
04:33:03,079 --> 04:33:04,119
Okay, now I can hear this.

1935
04:33:04,680 --> 04:33:05,639
All right, we're going to put this on.

1936
04:33:06,200 --> 04:33:09,919
Let's do a browser capture here.

1937
04:33:09,919 --> 04:33:10,799
Let's just watch this.

1938
04:33:11,520 --> 04:33:14,009
Because I am just chilling right now.

1939
04:33:14,009 --> 04:33:15,450
Just trying to relax out of the VR.

1940
04:33:16,090 --> 04:33:16,889
Let's watch a video.

1941
04:33:17,450 --> 04:33:26,759
This is the 11 scariest drones.

1942
04:33:26,759 --> 04:33:27,560
Let's go.

1943
04:33:27,560 --> 04:33:31,450
11 scariest things caught by drones.

1944
04:33:32,169 --> 04:33:32,650
Watch it.

1945
04:33:33,610 --> 04:33:34,490
I'm not going to watch that.

1946
04:33:40,720 --> 04:33:43,130
This is going to turn into the same joke again.

1947
04:33:44,009 --> 04:33:47,119
Yeah, this is the dirtiest hit.

1948
04:33:47,840 --> 04:33:55,840
This is a great Buzzfeed video.

1949
04:33:56,560 --> 04:34:08,080
Is that a demonic?

1950
04:34:11,720 --> 04:34:12,520
Oh, come on.

1951
04:34:13,240 --> 04:34:20,669
How is that a drone?

1952
04:34:21,470 --> 04:34:27,150
Kid was testing his new drone in the forest.

1953
04:34:27,869 --> 04:34:30,990
He's given a terrifying man these.

1954
04:34:31,709 --> 04:34:40,380
That's not even me.

1955
04:34:43,319 --> 04:35:10,169
Loch Ness is famous for its myth of what it smells like.

1956
04:35:10,169 --> 04:35:21,389
I got to just climb in the fucking window

1957
04:35:21,389 --> 04:35:22,590
and just start using the computer.

1958
04:35:23,549 --> 04:35:42,540
The next drone footage is too gruesome.

1959
04:35:42,540 --> 04:35:43,979
While in the air, the whole balloon crew

1960
04:35:43,979 --> 04:35:45,500
would be eaten alive by this thing.

1961
04:36:00,299 --> 04:36:02,779
How did you, the crop, you, the frame by frame,

1962
04:36:02,779 --> 04:36:03,580
crop that shit up?

1963
04:36:26,060 --> 04:36:26,939
That was wonderful.

1964
04:36:28,220 --> 04:36:32,810
Jeremy, please forgive me if I got you upset

1965
04:36:32,810 --> 04:36:34,810
by using your image in such unpleasant ways.

1966
04:36:34,810 --> 04:36:35,450
I didn't mean it.

1967
04:36:36,409 --> 04:36:37,049
No, that's fine.

1968
04:36:38,009 --> 04:36:38,650
This got me.

1969
04:36:40,360 --> 04:36:40,860
Probably.

1970
04:36:43,630 --> 04:36:44,430
Hey, look.

1971
04:36:44,430 --> 04:36:48,169
I wonder what's going to happen in like a week.

1972
04:36:49,290 --> 04:36:50,250
News bloopers.

1973
04:36:50,729 --> 04:36:56,490
Uh, and no, I'm not going to watch that video.

1974
04:36:57,689 --> 04:37:02,560
So not going to watch the best 2017 news bloopers.

1975
04:37:03,439 --> 04:37:10,680
See you in a week or two when we watch another one of these.

1976
04:37:10,680 --> 04:37:13,159
I'm not, well, I'm not going to watch news bloopers.

1977
04:37:16,860 --> 04:37:17,900
The cycle continues.

1978
04:37:20,319 --> 04:37:22,000
That was fucking hilarious.

1979
04:37:22,000 --> 04:37:22,479
That was great.

1980
04:37:23,400 --> 04:37:24,119
Thank you for that.

1981
04:37:27,000 --> 04:37:28,919
That was really, really, really fucking funny.

1982
04:37:29,479 --> 04:37:30,520
Thank you, trust no one.

1983
04:37:30,520 --> 04:37:32,279
From $3 and that video.

1984
04:37:34,759 --> 04:37:35,479
Jess, you got it.

1985
04:37:35,479 --> 04:37:36,279
Thanks for the $1.

1986
04:37:36,279 --> 04:37:37,479
You look like a chimney sweep.

1987
04:37:39,599 --> 04:37:42,119
I gotta go like wash my face.

1988
04:37:42,119 --> 04:37:44,119
I gotta get in the shower and like condition my hair.

1989
04:37:44,759 --> 04:37:50,779
Thank you super seal for the $2.50.

1990
04:37:50,779 --> 04:37:54,380
Drink orange juice after brushing your teeth on stream or scared.

1991
04:37:56,029 --> 04:37:57,549
That's gonna ruin orange juice for me.

1992
04:37:58,860 --> 04:38:00,700
I don't put alcohol in my orange juice

1993
04:38:00,700 --> 04:38:03,419
and I don't brush my teeth and drink orange juice

1994
04:38:03,419 --> 04:38:04,220
because it ruins it.

1995
04:38:04,860 --> 04:38:12,619
I have something to look up how to clean the inside of your Vive visor

1996
04:38:12,619 --> 04:38:13,979
because it is disgusting.

1997
04:38:15,720 --> 04:38:18,200
If somebody was here and they had a cotton swab or something

1998
04:38:18,200 --> 04:38:20,680
or like a Q-tip and you just went,

1999
04:38:20,680 --> 04:38:24,279
you dragged across the front of that glass in there,

2000
04:38:25,470 --> 04:38:27,150
you would have enough to probably make

2001
04:38:27,150 --> 04:38:29,470
a whole nother like species of fucking mutants.

2002
04:38:30,110 --> 04:38:31,150
It's filthy in there.

2003
04:38:31,790 --> 04:38:35,479
But thank you super seal.

2004
04:38:35,479 --> 04:38:35,959
Thank you again.

2005
04:38:35,959 --> 04:38:37,400
Frodeon weapon gave $50 early.

2006
04:38:37,400 --> 04:38:38,119
Thank you so much again.

2007
04:38:41,069 --> 04:38:42,270
Big money from Frodeon.

2008
04:38:43,259 --> 04:38:44,619
Timmy Tim Tim, thanks for the $1.

2009
04:38:44,619 --> 04:38:45,659
They say crazy person.

2010
04:38:51,470 --> 04:38:52,430
Crazy person.

2011
04:38:52,430 --> 04:38:54,430
No, this is just somebody playing VR.

2012
04:38:56,680 --> 04:38:57,159
Very okay.

2013
04:38:57,159 --> 04:39:02,759
If I didn't have the VR helmet or the helmet hair,

2014
04:39:02,759 --> 04:39:05,400
I need a haircut.

2015
04:39:05,400 --> 04:39:11,439
Look at that fucking helmet bedhead hair.

2016
04:39:12,000 --> 04:39:13,959
No, that's somebody just playing VR.

2017
04:39:15,340 --> 04:39:16,380
But thank you Timmy Tim Tim.

2018
04:39:17,419 --> 04:39:18,380
Guild here again.

2019
04:39:18,380 --> 04:39:19,659
Huge amount of community subs.

2020
04:39:20,459 --> 04:39:21,740
Renix, thanks for the $5.

2021
04:39:22,459 --> 04:39:23,979
After you download mod installer,

2022
04:39:23,979 --> 04:39:25,819
you can download songs in game.

2023
04:39:25,819 --> 04:39:26,299
Okay, cool.

2024
04:39:26,939 --> 04:39:28,540
I'll get that set up before we stream tomorrow.

2025
04:39:31,000 --> 04:39:32,759
Thank you Gibbler for the three bucks.

2026
04:39:32,759 --> 04:39:34,599
Jerma, I didn't know that you were a coal miner.

2027
04:39:35,240 --> 04:39:36,279
That's the one we just looked at.

2028
04:39:36,919 --> 04:39:41,290
It's fucking wild.

2029
04:39:41,290 --> 04:39:42,330
Thank you so much, Gibbler.

2030
04:39:44,279 --> 04:39:46,759
Mentosium, thanks for the four dollars and 20 cents.

2031
04:39:46,759 --> 04:39:49,240
Hey Jerma, got you featured on the Yogscast Jingle Jam.

2032
04:39:49,240 --> 04:39:51,000
I was wondering if you've seen harder,

2033
04:39:51,000 --> 04:39:52,439
better, faster Jerma on YouTube.

2034
04:39:52,439 --> 04:39:53,319
I think you'll enjoy it.

2035
04:39:56,029 --> 04:39:58,189
I think I do remember the Yogscast thing.

2036
04:39:58,909 --> 04:40:03,040
It was green screen footage, right?

2037
04:40:03,040 --> 04:40:05,689
It was good shit.

2038
04:40:05,689 --> 04:40:06,090
I'm here.

2039
04:40:06,090 --> 04:40:06,490
I'm right here.

2040
04:40:06,490 --> 04:40:06,889
I'm right here.

2041
04:40:06,889 --> 04:40:08,009
You don't have to beep.

2042
04:40:08,009 --> 04:40:09,450
You don't have to beep.

2043
04:40:09,450 --> 04:40:09,770
I'm here.

2044
04:40:11,959 --> 04:40:13,080
Better, faster Jerma, I think.

2045
04:40:13,639 --> 04:40:15,880
Did we watch that like last week or something?

2046
04:40:18,040 --> 04:40:18,919
The name is familiar.

2047
04:40:18,919 --> 04:40:20,360
I'm not sure if maybe we have.

2048
04:40:24,060 --> 04:40:24,540
No, me.

2049
04:40:25,099 --> 04:40:26,700
I vaguely remember.

2050
04:40:26,700 --> 04:40:32,200
I don't think we did.

2051
04:40:34,680 --> 04:40:35,959
Better, faster, hold on.

2052
04:40:35,959 --> 04:40:36,759
What's it called?

2053
04:40:36,759 --> 04:40:44,009
Better, faster, harder, better, faster Jerma.

2054
04:40:44,009 --> 04:40:45,439
Let me take a look and see.

2055
04:41:00,430 --> 04:41:01,790
Oh, it's a green screen video.

2056
04:41:01,790 --> 04:41:07,759
Okay, I'm going to save this.

2057
04:41:08,400 --> 04:41:10,000
And I know I've said this a bunch of times,

2058
04:41:10,000 --> 04:41:13,659
but the green screen encore stream

2059
04:41:14,729 --> 04:41:16,569
is actually going to happen here

2060
04:41:16,569 --> 04:41:19,849
probably next week or the week after.

2061
04:41:19,849 --> 04:41:20,889
It's actually going to happen.

2062
04:41:22,279 --> 04:41:24,360
I've talked about it for the last three and a half weeks

2063
04:41:25,000 --> 04:41:27,240
and it's time to actually compile them

2064
04:41:27,240 --> 04:41:29,799
and do another encore green screen night.

2065
04:41:31,580 --> 04:41:33,900
So in maybe two weeks,

2066
04:41:34,619 --> 04:41:38,490
I'm actually going to talk to the mods about it.

2067
04:41:38,490 --> 04:41:39,529
We'll figure it out again.

2068
04:41:43,229 --> 04:41:46,430
But this one is not another submissions thing

2069
04:41:46,430 --> 04:41:49,470
as much as it is like a couple hours of ones

2070
04:41:49,470 --> 04:41:50,909
that have come out since.

2071
04:41:50,909 --> 04:41:52,880
So it's not going to be another.

2072
04:41:52,880 --> 04:41:54,159
All right, here's a ton of submissions here.

2073
04:41:54,159 --> 04:41:55,840
We're going to watch like 500 videos.

2074
04:41:57,020 --> 04:41:58,060
I'd like to keep it a little.

2075
04:41:58,619 --> 04:42:02,060
Maybe we'll do it at the end of one stream in particular.

2076
04:42:02,060 --> 04:42:03,549
Might be fun to do.

2077
04:42:06,009 --> 04:42:07,290
It's like Christmas morning.

2078
04:42:07,290 --> 04:42:10,409
My hair, if I grab the front of my hair

2079
04:42:11,049 --> 04:42:14,810
and if I pulled even with like a quarter of a pound of pressure,

2080
04:42:14,810 --> 04:42:16,330
the whole tuft is going to come out.

2081
04:42:19,229 --> 04:42:21,709
I'm going to have to do like a treatment to my head.

2082
04:42:24,830 --> 04:42:25,549
We'll watch that.

2083
04:42:25,549 --> 04:42:27,709
I will make sure it's saved a book market

2084
04:42:27,709 --> 04:42:30,729
because green screen stuff I'd like to watch

2085
04:42:31,740 --> 04:42:38,619
in a better setting where we're all ready for it.

2086
04:42:38,619 --> 04:42:42,319
But thank you so much, Mentosium.

2087
04:42:43,310 --> 04:42:44,349
We will see it soon.

2088
04:42:46,619 --> 04:42:49,080
Thank you, Freudian Weapon for the four dollars.

2089
04:42:49,080 --> 04:42:52,279
Random question, but I'm making a video game themed workout playlist.

2090
04:42:52,840 --> 04:42:56,119
Any actiony game OSTs you could recommend.

2091
04:42:56,119 --> 04:42:56,840
I love the VR stuff.

2092
04:42:56,840 --> 04:42:58,680
Can't wait to see the upcoming craziness.

2093
04:42:58,680 --> 04:42:59,549
Have a good night.

2094
04:43:01,150 --> 04:43:07,479
Uh, a video game theme, but any actiony game OSTs?

2095
04:43:07,479 --> 04:43:12,939
I mean, the easy one is probably Hotline.

2096
04:43:12,939 --> 04:43:13,979
Somebody already said it.

2097
04:43:13,979 --> 04:43:18,409
Hotline Miami is really, you know, will really pump you up.

2098
04:43:19,049 --> 04:43:19,770
Both OSTs.

2099
04:43:19,770 --> 04:43:20,569
I would just get them both.

2100
04:43:24,119 --> 04:43:28,220
Any other OSTs?

2101
04:43:28,220 --> 04:43:29,900
That's what I would say those first.

2102
04:43:34,189 --> 04:43:34,590
Doom.

2103
04:43:34,590 --> 04:43:38,479
Doom is more, man, maybe.

2104
04:43:39,119 --> 04:43:44,750
Just go get the whole Smash Brothers.

2105
04:43:44,750 --> 04:43:47,069
Go get the entire Smash Brothers OST.

2106
04:43:47,069 --> 04:43:52,299
But yeah, probably I would say Hotline Miami.

2107
04:43:53,930 --> 04:43:55,450
Flammable Cowl, thanks for the five dollars.

2108
04:43:55,450 --> 04:43:59,290
I recently started playing Chrono Trigger after you mentioned it and enjoyed it.

2109
04:43:59,290 --> 04:44:02,810
I didn't have the privilege of growing up in the boomer generation and was wondering

2110
04:44:02,810 --> 04:44:04,970
what's an old underrated game that you recommend.

2111
04:44:04,970 --> 04:44:06,330
Much love, The Neverhood.

2112
04:44:06,330 --> 04:44:08,319
I'll say that every single time.

2113
04:44:08,880 --> 04:44:10,639
Mario RPG, Chrono Trigger, The Neverhood.

2114
04:44:11,279 --> 04:44:13,439
Um, some of the other old ones.

2115
04:44:17,000 --> 04:44:18,279
That's probably the top three.

2116
04:44:18,279 --> 04:44:22,240
It's really hard to get a hold of The Neverhood, though.

2117
04:44:26,939 --> 04:44:27,580
Earthworm Jims.

2118
04:44:27,580 --> 04:44:29,020
Earthworm Jims, I don't know if I...

2119
04:44:29,979 --> 04:44:32,380
I'm not so sure Earthworm Jims still holds up.

2120
04:44:33,020 --> 04:44:37,450
It's been a long time since I played it, but I remember trying to play it again

2121
04:44:37,450 --> 04:44:39,450
within the last five or so years.

2122
04:44:40,330 --> 04:44:46,159
And it was, it was like, I wasn't really enjoying it.

2123
04:44:46,159 --> 04:44:48,479
The soundtrack for Earthworm Jim is amazing.

2124
04:44:48,479 --> 04:44:55,790
But The Neverhood is, I just love that game.

2125
04:44:55,790 --> 04:45:01,950
Add Desert Bus VR to the games to play tomorrow.

2126
04:45:01,950 --> 04:45:07,400
Well, I want to go through the most requested ones first.

2127
04:45:07,400 --> 04:45:10,360
Because stuff like Blade and Source, ReBeat Saber, Budget Cuts,

2128
04:45:11,439 --> 04:45:13,360
uh, like Super Hot VR.

2129
04:45:13,360 --> 04:45:15,400
There's a couple of like the...

2130
04:45:15,400 --> 04:45:19,479
There's at least like five that people really, really wanted to see

2131
04:45:19,479 --> 04:45:21,720
and that I was really wanting to play.

2132
04:45:21,720 --> 04:45:30,319
So we'll do some other weird random ones after we go through like the top ones.

2133
04:45:30,319 --> 04:45:36,700
Gorn, yeah, Gorn's another one.

2134
04:45:36,700 --> 04:45:41,900
Yeah, there's so many to play that I don't want to really overwhelm myself

2135
04:45:41,900 --> 04:45:43,799
because here's what's going to happen, right?

2136
04:45:43,799 --> 04:45:47,630
So when we're doing these VR streams,

2137
04:45:49,520 --> 04:45:53,360
I'd like to only do like a few of them each night,

2138
04:45:53,360 --> 04:45:54,959
maybe like two or three of them each night

2139
04:45:54,959 --> 04:45:59,200
because I want to get the whole experience from these games.

2140
04:45:59,200 --> 04:46:02,639
I don't want to just open like Budget Cuts and play it for 20 minutes

2141
04:46:02,639 --> 04:46:03,680
and be like, all right, what's the next one?

2142
04:46:03,680 --> 04:46:04,720
I got like 15 of these.

2143
04:46:04,720 --> 04:46:08,080
It's not like the PlayStation 2 streams or the Dreamcast stuff,

2144
04:46:08,080 --> 04:46:10,799
or I want to give each one at least like a couple hours

2145
04:46:10,799 --> 04:46:15,000
or like one, at least one to two hours.

2146
04:46:15,000 --> 04:46:17,000
So I can get the whole experience out of them.

2147
04:46:17,000 --> 04:46:23,040
And I'm not exactly sure how long something like Budget Cuts is.

2148
04:46:23,119 --> 04:46:28,319
But it feels like I'm getting at least enough of a package there

2149
04:46:28,319 --> 04:46:30,720
where I've had enough fun where I'm ready to do something else.

2150
04:46:30,720 --> 04:46:35,130
But we'll see.

2151
04:46:35,130 --> 04:46:38,139
I will have another list of about three or four,

2152
04:46:38,139 --> 04:46:43,840
maybe three or so tomorrow.

2153
04:46:43,840 --> 04:46:44,880
But thank you, Flammable Cow.

2154
04:46:44,880 --> 04:46:46,400
Thank you, Buster Boy, for the three bucks.

2155
04:46:46,959 --> 04:46:48,400
How can I gift you Steam games?

2156
04:46:48,400 --> 04:46:51,599
There's a game called Jet Island that is an amazing VR game

2157
04:46:51,599 --> 04:46:53,310
that I'd like you to play.

2158
04:46:53,310 --> 04:46:56,569
You don't have to do any gifting or anything like that.

2159
04:46:57,130 --> 04:46:58,569
If you have a recommendation for a game,

2160
04:46:59,290 --> 04:47:00,409
I have a Discord.

2161
04:47:00,409 --> 04:47:02,080
If you want to go to the Discord,

2162
04:47:02,080 --> 04:47:04,759
there's a recommended channel.

2163
04:47:04,759 --> 04:47:07,240
You can go there and just put anything

2164
04:47:07,240 --> 04:47:09,500
that you think you'd like to see on stream.

2165
04:47:09,500 --> 04:47:11,740
It's not a discussion channel.

2166
04:47:11,740 --> 04:47:14,220
It's just a place to put recommendations.

2167
04:47:14,220 --> 04:47:15,919
And I look at it all the time.

2168
04:47:15,919 --> 04:47:18,799
I look at the recommended channel at least once a week

2169
04:47:18,799 --> 04:47:20,639
and I kind of scroll up and see what's been said.

2170
04:47:20,639 --> 04:47:22,560
And if I want to do something and I can, you know,

2171
04:47:22,560 --> 04:47:25,000
pinpoint things that I'd like to do.

2172
04:47:25,000 --> 04:47:27,680
So yeah, recommend a channel in the Discord

2173
04:47:27,680 --> 04:47:30,169
if you have anything you'd like me to check out.

2174
04:47:30,169 --> 04:47:33,099
But thank you, Buster Boy, for the three bucks.

2175
04:47:34,349 --> 04:47:37,069
Hey, something or other and there's no music, is there?

2176
04:47:37,069 --> 04:47:38,430
No, get back here.

2177
04:47:38,430 --> 04:47:40,650
Something or other, thanks for the one dollar.

2178
04:47:40,650 --> 04:47:41,529
Agent Smith voice.

2179
04:47:42,090 --> 04:47:44,250
You can't escape the Matrix, Mr. Elbertson.

2180
04:47:44,810 --> 04:47:52,349
I'll get out.

2181
04:47:52,349 --> 04:47:54,349
Hey, for real though, thanks for the two dollars and 50 cents.

2182
04:47:54,349 --> 04:47:56,189
Did you eat your Rice Krispies this morning?

2183
04:47:56,919 --> 04:47:58,520
Did I eat my Rice Krispies?

2184
04:48:03,000 --> 04:48:05,000
It's the only cereal that talks to you

2185
04:48:05,000 --> 04:48:07,240
and that makes for a great company in the morning.

2186
04:48:07,240 --> 04:48:08,759
How do you know we don't just fucking run?

2187
04:48:16,009 --> 04:48:17,049
I don't know what that is.

2188
04:48:17,049 --> 04:48:18,409
I don't know if I want to play that.

2189
04:48:18,409 --> 04:48:19,610
I don't know what that is.

2190
04:48:19,610 --> 04:48:24,479
But thank you for the two dollars and 50 cents.

2191
04:48:24,479 --> 04:48:26,479
Because, you know, living one life sucks enough.

2192
04:48:27,040 --> 04:48:29,119
Going through the hardships of one life is bad enough,

2193
04:48:29,119 --> 04:48:29,919
but to do it again,

2194
04:48:30,880 --> 04:48:37,180
I read this pamphlet at my doctor's office one time.

2195
04:48:37,180 --> 04:48:44,220
There it is.

2196
04:48:44,220 --> 04:48:46,380
You really do need context.

2197
04:48:46,380 --> 04:48:48,380
There's no context at the audio.

2198
04:48:48,380 --> 04:48:49,979
It's just, it makes no sense.

2199
04:48:50,540 --> 04:48:52,459
It'll make perfect sense if you watch it.

2200
04:48:54,799 --> 04:48:55,759
Thank you for real though.

2201
04:48:55,759 --> 04:48:57,279
Thank you, Tingy, for the one dollar in my last bit,

2202
04:48:57,279 --> 04:48:59,119
so I might as well use them before it goes to two fifty.

2203
04:48:59,680 --> 04:49:01,520
Just want to say that I love this community and you,

2204
04:49:01,520 --> 04:49:01,919
Jerma.

2205
04:49:01,919 --> 04:49:03,599
You guys make each stream a great experience.

2206
04:49:05,080 --> 04:49:05,959
Thank you so much, Tingy.

2207
04:49:07,389 --> 04:49:10,029
Yeah, the two fifty minimum is just,

2208
04:49:10,029 --> 04:49:12,189
it's just gonna happen here probably tomorrow.

2209
04:49:14,270 --> 04:49:20,880
I will probably continue to read under two fifty

2210
04:49:22,029 --> 04:49:24,189
for at least maybe like one or two more streams

2211
04:49:24,189 --> 04:49:25,630
after the change.

2212
04:49:26,430 --> 04:49:28,830
Just because there's no way with the amount of people

2213
04:49:28,830 --> 04:49:31,470
that are here that everybody will know.

2214
04:49:31,470 --> 04:49:32,189
You know what I'm saying?

2215
04:49:32,990 --> 04:49:34,349
It's changing tomorrow,

2216
04:49:34,990 --> 04:49:38,029
but I'm gonna continue to read under two fifty

2217
04:49:38,029 --> 04:49:39,310
for at least another two or three streams.

2218
04:49:39,869 --> 04:49:46,569
Because, I mean, it's hard to keep everybody

2219
04:49:46,569 --> 04:49:47,369
aware of what's going on.

2220
04:49:48,090 --> 04:49:55,000
But thank you for the one dollar.

2221
04:49:55,000 --> 04:49:57,560
It's a pleasure to have as many great people

2222
04:49:57,560 --> 04:49:58,680
here as there are.

2223
04:49:58,680 --> 04:49:59,400
So thank you.

2224
04:50:00,119 --> 04:50:02,159
Put it in the stream title.

2225
04:50:03,919 --> 04:50:05,200
Maybe, I don't know if I want to like

2226
04:50:05,200 --> 04:50:06,479
blow it up the stream title though.

2227
04:50:06,479 --> 04:50:08,000
It already has like the shirts thing there.

2228
04:50:08,799 --> 04:50:10,159
And I don't want to be like one of those,

2229
04:50:11,119 --> 04:50:12,240
exclamation point shirts,

2230
04:50:12,240 --> 04:50:13,680
exclamation point stream changes,

2231
04:50:13,680 --> 04:50:15,040
exclamation point prime,

2232
04:50:15,040 --> 04:50:15,759
exclamation point.

2233
04:50:16,400 --> 04:50:17,759
Once you start adding exclamation points,

2234
04:50:17,759 --> 04:50:18,479
they just keep going.

2235
04:50:23,400 --> 04:50:24,759
Everyone knows about the shirts though.

2236
04:50:24,759 --> 04:50:25,720
It's not necessarily true,

2237
04:50:26,360 --> 04:50:29,959
but thank you Tingy.

2238
04:50:31,209 --> 04:50:33,049
Thank you Radja Sil for the one dollar.

2239
04:50:33,049 --> 04:50:34,569
Hey Jerma, I've been standing outside your window

2240
04:50:34,569 --> 04:50:36,090
trying to get your attention for about two hours.

2241
04:50:36,729 --> 04:50:37,689
But you're not noticing me.

2242
04:50:37,689 --> 04:50:38,970
I've been revving up my engine

2243
04:50:38,970 --> 04:50:40,409
and honking my horn and everything.

2244
04:50:41,130 --> 04:50:43,319
Well, you did get my attention.

2245
04:50:43,319 --> 04:50:44,119
I didn't know it was you.

2246
04:50:44,840 --> 04:50:47,069
But thank you for the one dollar.

2247
04:50:47,069 --> 04:50:48,590
Thank you Clueless Sniper for the one dollar.

2248
04:50:49,310 --> 04:50:49,790
Appreciate it.

2249
04:50:49,790 --> 04:50:50,110
Thank you.

2250
04:50:51,069 --> 04:50:53,150
And finally here we had Adala from Multitrip.

2251
04:50:53,869 --> 04:50:54,909
I don't know if it's on the list,

2252
04:50:54,909 --> 04:50:56,349
but you should definitely play hot dogs,

2253
04:50:56,349 --> 04:50:58,029
horseshoes, and hand grenades.

2254
04:50:58,029 --> 04:51:00,590
It's basically like that first game you played,

2255
04:51:00,590 --> 04:51:02,830
but with guns and tons of game modes.

2256
04:51:05,790 --> 04:51:06,270
Absolutely.

2257
04:51:08,569 --> 04:51:11,450
I am 100% on board

2258
04:51:12,009 --> 04:51:13,529
with any and all of these really,

2259
04:51:13,529 --> 04:51:14,810
really interesting VR games.

2260
04:51:15,529 --> 04:51:17,659
Because I am, it's, you know, it's great.

2261
04:51:18,540 --> 04:51:20,700
It's like, okay.

2262
04:51:20,700 --> 04:51:23,799
So if you, I'm like two and a half,

2263
04:51:23,799 --> 04:51:25,159
three years late to this shit.

2264
04:51:26,040 --> 04:51:29,080
There's such a huge compiling of awesome VR games.

2265
04:51:29,819 --> 04:51:31,979
This has to be what it feels like.

2266
04:51:31,979 --> 04:51:33,500
If you're, if you're like,

2267
04:51:33,500 --> 04:51:35,900
let's say like 11, 12, 13 years old right now,

2268
04:51:36,459 --> 04:51:38,139
you grow up, you know, you're 13,

2269
04:51:38,139 --> 04:51:40,299
you turn 14, 50, get your steam account.

2270
04:51:40,299 --> 04:51:41,900
When you, you've got like,

2271
04:51:41,900 --> 04:51:44,700
think of all the shit that like a 15, 16 year old

2272
04:51:44,700 --> 04:51:46,860
that gets their hand on steam for the first time.

2273
04:51:47,580 --> 04:51:51,740
This backlog of a decade of incredible experiences

2274
04:51:51,740 --> 04:51:52,220
that they have.

2275
04:51:54,560 --> 04:51:59,290
Wow. That's how I feel right now.

2276
04:51:59,290 --> 04:52:01,049
I feel like I'm 12.

2277
04:52:01,049 --> 04:52:02,409
I just made my steam account.

2278
04:52:03,150 --> 04:52:05,549
And Rajasil, if you're going to drive by,

2279
04:52:05,549 --> 04:52:07,229
at least like make it, must know it's you.

2280
04:52:08,349 --> 04:52:11,709
But I feel like I'm 12.

2281
04:52:11,709 --> 04:52:13,229
And I just made my first ever steam account.

2282
04:52:13,229 --> 04:52:14,830
And like The Witcher 3.

2283
04:52:15,389 --> 04:52:15,950
Holy shit.

2284
04:52:15,950 --> 04:52:16,909
I've never, what's that one?

2285
04:52:17,470 --> 04:52:18,349
What, there's three of these?

2286
04:52:18,349 --> 04:52:20,430
I can play one, two, and three.

2287
04:52:20,430 --> 04:52:21,470
I don't even know what this is.

2288
04:52:23,759 --> 04:52:24,319
What's this game?

2289
04:52:24,319 --> 04:52:25,360
The Team Fortress?

2290
04:52:25,919 --> 04:52:27,119
What the fuck is that thing?

2291
04:52:28,400 --> 04:52:31,439
I've never even been inside this game once.

2292
04:52:31,439 --> 04:52:32,720
That's how I feel right now with VR.

2293
04:52:36,619 --> 04:52:37,819
By the way, I've never played through

2294
04:52:37,819 --> 04:52:39,180
any of The Witcher games.

2295
04:52:39,180 --> 04:52:41,099
I'm just pretending to think they're cool.

2296
04:52:41,099 --> 04:52:42,540
So people will think I'm, you know,

2297
04:52:42,540 --> 04:52:44,590
they can pretend to think I'm cool.

2298
04:52:44,590 --> 04:52:51,150
That's the only reason why I said that.

2299
04:52:51,150 --> 04:52:57,200
I'm just pretending to know what they are.

2300
04:52:57,200 --> 04:52:58,560
You are not cool.

2301
04:53:02,409 --> 04:53:03,209
It has a horse.

2302
04:53:06,400 --> 04:53:08,000
And at the very end here, we got double D,

2303
04:53:08,799 --> 04:53:10,479
doubled 11 for the $2 here.

2304
04:53:12,200 --> 04:53:15,130
Hey, are you also going to do VR chat with Kiwo?

2305
04:53:15,130 --> 04:53:15,689
Yes.

2306
04:53:15,689 --> 04:53:18,409
But that's going to have to be at a different time.

2307
04:53:19,130 --> 04:53:21,369
Because I was told, I was under the impression,

2308
04:53:21,369 --> 04:53:23,689
I think that Kiwo is not available.

2309
04:53:24,409 --> 04:53:26,569
I think that Kiwo is doing something.

2310
04:53:26,569 --> 04:53:28,490
She's gone or not around or something.

2311
04:53:29,049 --> 04:53:33,200
I was going to get the VR chat tutorial

2312
04:53:33,200 --> 04:53:34,479
from Kiwo as a stream.

2313
04:53:35,529 --> 04:53:37,770
That is not going to be part of this,

2314
04:53:37,770 --> 04:53:39,770
you know, two or three streams in a row of VR.

2315
04:53:40,330 --> 04:53:41,610
That's going to be, I just have it.

2316
04:53:41,610 --> 04:53:45,610
And when we can, because maybe she's, she's EU, right?

2317
04:53:45,610 --> 04:53:48,250
So that's going to be, that's going to be a little

2318
04:53:48,250 --> 04:53:49,450
fucky trying to get that to work.

2319
04:53:49,450 --> 04:53:54,669
Because I am like almost eight to 10 hours behind her.

2320
04:53:55,610 --> 04:53:56,650
So we'll figure it out.

2321
04:53:57,290 --> 04:54:02,990
But I look forward to the VR tutorial.

2322
04:54:08,159 --> 04:54:09,919
Streams like 12 hours a day.

2323
04:54:11,360 --> 04:54:12,479
God, I wish I had the energy.

2324
04:54:14,650 --> 04:54:17,209
Like I put like laser beams into my eyes for four hours

2325
04:54:17,209 --> 04:54:18,330
and I have to like go lie down.

2326
04:54:19,930 --> 04:54:21,689
And they all say I have a 200 word essay due

2327
04:54:21,689 --> 04:54:22,569
and I'm here watching Jerma.

2328
04:54:22,569 --> 04:54:24,060
What am I doing?

2329
04:54:24,060 --> 04:54:25,500
You added 50 words.

2330
04:54:25,500 --> 04:54:28,299
Hey Buster Boy, thanks for the $1 at the very end.

2331
04:54:28,299 --> 04:54:29,819
I got my Oculus Rift a month ago

2332
04:54:29,819 --> 04:54:31,180
and I know exactly what you're saying.

2333
04:54:31,180 --> 04:54:31,900
Yeah, it's great.

2334
04:54:34,189 --> 04:54:36,509
I have like a year and a half worth

2335
04:54:36,509 --> 04:54:37,869
of experiences that I haven't done.

2336
04:54:38,430 --> 04:54:39,470
So it feels great.

2337
04:54:41,720 --> 04:54:42,680
And let's run the credits.

2338
04:54:42,680 --> 04:54:43,400
That's the end of the bits.

2339
04:54:49,150 --> 04:54:54,889
I will see you fine group of people tomorrow.

2340
04:54:54,889 --> 04:55:01,020
Tomorrow is the day for more VR.

2341
04:55:01,020 --> 04:55:08,330
He's pretending that that joke wasn't made last stream.

2342
04:55:14,299 --> 04:55:15,900
Really short post stream today.

2343
04:55:16,799 --> 04:55:19,200
Yeah, I got to figure it's because of VR.

2344
04:55:20,319 --> 04:55:23,119
Because I didn't have the stream labs wasn't really on.

2345
04:55:23,119 --> 04:55:24,479
I can't really see anything anyways.

2346
04:55:28,409 --> 04:55:29,290
But no, it's all good.

2347
04:55:29,849 --> 04:55:31,419
It's good shit.

2348
04:55:33,450 --> 04:55:36,409
Are you going to have OVR drop working next time?

2349
04:55:36,409 --> 04:55:38,409
Do you need any help to get it attached to your hand?

2350
04:55:39,130 --> 04:55:39,930
I might.

2351
04:55:40,970 --> 04:55:42,650
I didn't really do a proper tutorial.

2352
04:55:42,650 --> 04:55:46,000
So I did get the chat to be on the screen.

2353
04:55:46,639 --> 04:55:48,080
But I want to get it like in that position.

2354
04:55:48,080 --> 04:55:49,599
But here's the weird part though, right?

2355
04:55:50,240 --> 04:55:51,919
So getting the chat on your hand.

2356
04:55:52,799 --> 04:55:56,639
Wouldn't that conflict with doing actions in the game?

2357
04:55:57,360 --> 04:55:59,279
So let's say I was in budget cuts, right?

2358
04:56:00,349 --> 04:56:03,389
How do I make it so I because I have the gun on my hand.

2359
04:56:03,389 --> 04:56:04,349
And I lift up my hand.

2360
04:56:04,349 --> 04:56:04,990
There's the gun.

2361
04:56:06,159 --> 04:56:08,880
How is the chat just always going to be on the hand?

2362
04:56:08,880 --> 04:56:16,939
Or do I have to do like a certain I have to rotate my hand to see it.

2363
04:56:16,939 --> 04:56:17,180
Okay.

2364
04:56:19,020 --> 04:56:20,619
Yeah, I plan on watching a couple of tutorials.

2365
04:56:20,619 --> 04:56:23,580
But if I'm still having trouble, then I'll be in the discord.

2366
04:56:23,580 --> 04:56:26,299
You bet your ass tomorrow at like 2 30.

2367
04:56:26,299 --> 04:56:30,139
I'll be in the discord like, look, I tried it and I don't understand how it worked.

2368
04:56:30,700 --> 04:56:36,540
But I'm going to give it a try.

2369
04:56:37,180 --> 04:56:38,139
Hey, pigeon.

2370
04:56:38,139 --> 04:56:39,500
Thanks for the one dollar.

2371
04:56:39,500 --> 04:56:42,139
Just got my interviews with mods and newbie done.

2372
04:56:42,139 --> 04:56:44,060
And I'm ready to start banging out that essay.

2373
04:56:44,060 --> 04:56:44,380
Sort of.

2374
04:56:44,380 --> 04:56:46,700
I need to compile that information into sections.

2375
04:56:47,259 --> 04:56:50,840
Make sure you use the quote where I said, eat your vegetables.

2376
04:56:50,840 --> 04:56:55,240
Eat plenty of high quality proteins like salmon and tuna fish.

2377
04:56:56,380 --> 04:57:00,139
And if you're going to work out, make sure you give yourself enough rest.

2378
04:57:02,169 --> 04:57:05,290
You know, if you work out, you lift and you do bicep curls.

2379
04:57:05,290 --> 04:57:07,770
Don't do bicep curls for like at least like three, four days.

2380
04:57:08,409 --> 04:57:09,610
Let your body recover.

2381
04:57:09,610 --> 04:57:10,889
Get that high quality protein.

2382
04:57:12,009 --> 04:57:14,169
And that's how you do good working out.

2383
04:57:14,169 --> 04:57:18,830
For, wait, that was, okay, that was, you could still use that quote anyways.

2384
04:57:18,830 --> 04:57:22,270
Just use a section of that and use it as a quote.

2385
04:57:22,270 --> 04:57:23,869
What are the plans on the encore green screen night?

2386
04:57:23,869 --> 04:57:25,740
We just were talking about it.

2387
04:57:25,740 --> 04:57:28,220
We were talking about how it's probably going to happen in a couple of weeks.

2388
04:57:28,220 --> 04:57:29,180
Said that really fast.

2389
04:57:30,139 --> 04:57:30,619
Too fast.

2390
04:57:30,619 --> 04:57:37,099
It could slow down.

2391
04:57:37,099 --> 04:57:41,099
Just eat french fries only and only french fries and you'll be fine.

2392
04:57:41,740 --> 04:57:44,669
That is a very bad advice.

2393
04:57:51,310 --> 04:57:52,029
Hey, that's me.

2394
04:57:54,680 --> 04:57:56,279
Hey, Double D, thanks for the one dollar.

2395
04:57:56,279 --> 04:57:57,159
It's a YouTube link.

2396
04:57:57,159 --> 04:57:57,880
Let's see what it is.

2397
04:58:01,479 --> 04:58:03,720
One bit of, one bit of German wisdom.

2398
04:58:03,720 --> 04:58:04,520
That's what we're going to.

2399
04:58:04,520 --> 04:58:06,279
One bit of wisdom.

2400
04:58:06,279 --> 04:58:06,759
It's a lot.

2401
04:58:06,759 --> 04:58:07,479
It's a lot of value.

2402
04:58:09,740 --> 04:58:12,040
That's pretty good wisdom.

2403
04:58:12,599 --> 04:58:15,580
You know, don't.

2404
04:58:16,700 --> 04:58:17,259
Be careful.

2405
04:58:20,650 --> 04:58:21,369
You're not going to get out.

2406
04:58:26,200 --> 04:58:27,080
All right, guys.

2407
04:58:27,159 --> 04:58:29,479
I will see you tomorrow with more VR.

2408
04:58:29,479 --> 04:58:30,200
I'm going to clean up.

2409
04:58:30,200 --> 04:58:31,319
I'm going to clean my shit up.

2410
04:58:31,959 --> 04:58:33,680
There's shit all over the place.

2411
04:58:33,680 --> 04:58:34,319
I've got to clean it up.

2412
04:58:35,450 --> 04:58:39,130
And the VR helmet needs a little bit of TLC here.

2413
04:58:40,090 --> 04:58:41,709
I'm going to take a shower.

2414
04:58:42,729 --> 04:58:43,369
See you tomorrow.

2415
04:58:43,369 --> 04:58:44,330
Have a great rest of your night.

2416
04:58:44,970 --> 04:58:46,000
Take care.

2417
04:58:46,889 --> 04:59:14,490
And ta ta.
