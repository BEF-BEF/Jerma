00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:13,119
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with a Diablo 3 video.

2
00:00:13,119 --> 00:00:21,120
And this is my first Diablo 3 video. If you're watching for the first time on my channel and you scroll back all the way to this video, this is the first one.

3
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:26,489
And before I say anything, I gotta tell you, this game has lived up to a lot of expectations.

4
00:00:26,489 --> 00:00:32,659
Now, I could do a total breakdown of what, pretty much a review of this game, but I'm not gonna do that right now.

5
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:38,659
I wanted to show you this because this is the fun part of Diablo. This is me, Shibby, 2142.

6
00:00:38,659 --> 00:00:43,659
Star and MLC Stealth. All four people max people in a game.

7
00:00:43,659 --> 00:00:50,840
And we were doing Act 2. This is Act 2. And it does need to be mentioned that there are going to be some minor spoilers in this video.

8
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:53,840
Because, of course, we're gonna kill the Act 2 bosses.

9
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:59,840
And if you don't want to see that, if you don't want to hear that, if you want to plug your ears and say la la la la la, that is totally fine.

10
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,840
So when we get there, you're welcome to do that.

11
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:08,140
I'm actually gonna put an annotation on the screen when a somewhat of a pretty important spoiler is about to happen.

12
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:10,140
So I will put that on the screen for you.

13
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:16,319
And my full Diablo 3 review slash breakdown, that's gonna come in probably the next couple of weeks.

14
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:25,319
Because I do want to play through as much as I can, get through Nightmare, get through Hell, try Inferno, before I really give a last final assessment of this game.

15
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:29,560
So look for that in the next couple of weeks. Maybe a little sooner, but I'm just not sure yet.

16
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:37,989
So besides that, the view schedule, the video schedule for this particular game is probably gonna run like this.

17
00:01:37,989 --> 00:01:47,230
Because this is such a massive game, because there is so much to do, I don't think I'm gonna make a Let's Play where I upload 500 videos or something like that.

18
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:51,230
Like, oh, here's episode one of 10,000. I'm not sure I'm going to do that.

19
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:55,599
What I'm going to do is probably live stream this game.

20
00:01:56,599 --> 00:01:59,599
Take what I get on the live stream, put it over here on YouTube.

21
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:03,599
So you might see, oh, we're in Nightmare this time, or we're in, oh, this is Hell Act 3.

22
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:06,599
And I'll make sure to label it, make sure to annotate it.

23
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:10,599
And the streams are gonna be a lot longer now. That's one of the things I did want to talk about.

24
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:19,599
So instead of the one hour or two hour long Team Fortress and Binding of Isaac type streams, they're now gonna be like six or seven hours long.

25
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:27,030
And hopefully I have my 720p streaming set up for YouTube, because if that's all set up, that's gonna be perfect.

26
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:33,030
Because what'll happen is right when the stream is done, if you don't want to sit there for the whole stream or if you have something to do, we all have busy schedules,

27
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:39,030
you can come back later and watch it in 720. Rather than lately, it's been about 360 for all my streams.

28
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:46,340
But that is the plan for Diablo 3, at least right now. I have another idea in my head that might come to fruition later.

29
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:51,509
But for now, check out this video. It's gonna be Act 2, the end of Act 2 in normal.

30
00:02:51,509 --> 00:02:59,009
This is the first reactions we had, so if you're wondering why I'm freaking out at certain points, it's because we never saw any of this stuff before, ever.

31
00:02:59,009 --> 00:03:05,009
So enjoy the live commentary, guys, and I will see you guys soon. And take care, everybody.

32
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:29,930
We're like single file. Look at that. We're like, look at Brett just nodding his head, like, yeah.

33
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:33,930
Which one's me? I'm inside freaking Jerma's shield.

34
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:36,930
We're all like, we're like cowering on each other.

35
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:40,930
We look like Scooby Doo and the gang, which is like all like, riding up on each other.

36
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:44,930
All right, so hold on. Let me go through my skills book and inventory.

37
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:45,930
Don't do it.

38
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:47,930
Hey guys, good boss fight.

39
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:48,930
Dropping that shit.

40
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:53,810
I picked up whatever you just dropped. I don't know what it is, but I wanted it.

41
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:55,810
But I wanted it, I wanted it, so I took it.

42
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:57,810
I wanna go in. I'm going in.

43
00:03:57,810 --> 00:03:58,810
Okay, I'm going in.

44
00:03:58,810 --> 00:03:59,810
All right, I'm going in.

45
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:00,810
Aw.

46
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:03,110
Accept. Start. Accept it.

47
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:05,110
I thought I did, maybe.

48
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:06,110
Oh, you did, you did.

49
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:07,110
Okay.

50
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:08,289
Here we go.

51
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:12,289
Let's do it. Zoltan, cool. I'm going around. I'm going around.

52
00:04:12,289 --> 00:04:17,319
Is that a bad idea? Should I not go around?

53
00:04:17,319 --> 00:04:19,319
Oh, they're slow bubbling me.

54
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:21,319
Come on, let's do it, Zoltan.

55
00:04:21,319 --> 00:04:24,319
What do you got, Zoltan? I'll take Zoltan for a ride.

56
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:25,319
There we go.

57
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:27,500
He's leveled up, too.

58
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:32,980
Oh, Zoltan, what a jump.

59
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:35,279
Yeah, I know. Look at this punk it destroyed.

60
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:36,279
What a jump.

61
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:40,899
All that build up for this guy just to take all this heat.

62
00:04:40,899 --> 00:04:42,899
Yeah, I know, all that power.

63
00:04:42,899 --> 00:04:45,589
Yeah, I thought you had a bunch of power.

64
00:04:45,589 --> 00:04:48,089
Well, all in a day's work, we just did it.

65
00:04:48,089 --> 00:04:50,089
Are you kidding me? What?

66
00:04:50,089 --> 00:04:52,579
Annihilated.

67
00:04:52,579 --> 00:04:57,579
Dude, is it like, now my true form, or is that was that it?

68
00:04:57,579 --> 00:04:58,579
Oh, that was it.

69
00:04:58,579 --> 00:05:00,579
And now my true form.

70
00:05:00,579 --> 00:05:02,579
That guy got so messed up.

71
00:05:02,579 --> 00:05:06,720
Dude, the butcher was hotter than that guy.

72
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,279
The get hurt skill.

73
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:11,279
Oh, man, I'm getting like lag right here.

74
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:14,279
That was bad news, bears.

75
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:16,279
This game.

76
00:05:16,279 --> 00:05:18,990
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

77
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:24,420
Yeah, I was pretty disappointed at first that you couldn't have like eight players in a lobby.

78
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:26,420
Yeah, thank you. Thank you. Thank you for that.

79
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:33,790
Thank you, Blizzard, for not allowing that to happen, because that would be literally, it would be unplayable.

80
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:37,480
You would just be right clicking and not even know where you were.

81
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:40,480
Yeah, because everyone has so many skills they could spam now.

82
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:43,480
That's why I turned on low effects. I couldn't take it.

83
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:47,449
Doesn't really change a whole lot anyway, though.

84
00:05:47,449 --> 00:05:49,449
Yeah, true death, true death.

85
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:52,779
Oh, everything's already dead over here.

86
00:05:52,779 --> 00:05:58,740
Even the ground is fighting us. What is, I don't even.

87
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:03,120
Man, I'm not even sure what I'm attacking anymore.

88
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,050
I'm just just walking.

89
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:08,050
Things are just dying.

90
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:10,050
Those were blue monsters, but who knew about it?

91
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:11,050
I didn't know.

92
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:15,220
We just we're just too super late for them to handle us.

93
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:19,019
Just over here.

94
00:06:19,019 --> 00:06:20,019
Nothing good.

95
00:06:20,019 --> 00:06:22,019
Oh, they start doing the move again.

96
00:06:22,019 --> 00:06:27,629
I thought we were trying to encourage her to do it.

97
00:06:27,629 --> 00:06:29,000
Oh, boss.

98
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
That's not. Wait, wait, wait.

99
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Are we fighting?

100
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Are we fighting?

101
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I need to go through my inventory.

102
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
We might be fighting for a while. I don't know, dude.

103
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Cancel, cancel.

104
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I need a moment.

105
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
You guys.

106
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
You guys.

107
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I need a moment.

108
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Shifty.

109
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,370
Update.

110
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:46,370
Oh, God.

111
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:47,370
Drop free again?

112
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:48,370
Drop free.

113
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:49,370
What if we kill them?

114
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:51,370
Legendary drops and the server shuts down.

115
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:53,370
Oh, they're about to shut down the servers right now.

116
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:54,370
We better make this quick.

117
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:56,610
We're too good.

118
00:06:56,610 --> 00:06:58,610
They caught on.

119
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:01,040
Skip this.

120
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:04,040
I want to hear what he has to say about his stones.

121
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:07,040
It's so funny because I really want to know what he has to say.

122
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,040
I can't even hear a word he's saying.

123
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,040
Me too.

124
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,040
Dude, last time this happened.

125
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,040
What?

126
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,040
Server shut down.

127
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,040
We have 15 minutes.

128
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:18,040
He is Belial.

129
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:21,040
I expected that.

130
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,040
Wow.

131
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,040
He's the Lord of Lies.

132
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:26,040
You expect Belial would be complying?

133
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:29,470
I didn't think he was going to be a kid.

134
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:30,470
He's Joffrey.

135
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:32,470
Joffrey was always a prick.

136
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:33,470
So yeah, we have 15 minutes.

137
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:35,470
The ladies were fine.

138
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:36,470
When did the servers go down?

139
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:37,470
Did it say?

140
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:38,470
15 minutes.

141
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:39,470
That's what it just said.

142
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:40,470
We can do this in 15 minutes.

143
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:41,470
Let's do it.

144
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:44,610
Are you serious about the servers going down?

145
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:45,610
Yep.

146
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:46,610
How do you know?

147
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:48,610
It said in the bottom-off chat.

148
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:49,610
All right.

149
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:51,610
We're fighting Belial right now.

150
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:53,360
Oh, see.

151
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,360
14 minutes.

152
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,790
All right.

153
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:56,790
Just rape him.

154
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:57,790
Oh, my gosh.

155
00:07:57,790 --> 00:07:58,790
This guy's dead.

156
00:07:58,790 --> 00:07:59,790
Belial, you are not.

157
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:03,790
You are a bad, bad Belial.

158
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:09,740
I think we just all combined have way too many things to stun people.

159
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:12,740
He's either stunned or frozen or dying.

160
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:14,740
There's no in-between.

161
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:15,740
Hey, get over here.

162
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:16,740
Oh, great.

163
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:17,740
Now his true form.

164
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:18,740
Remember we said we talked about this?

165
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:19,740
Oh, his true form.

166
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:20,740
Oh, he's like, Zarbond.

167
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:21,740
Zarbond.

168
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:22,740
Oh, okay.

169
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,040
Oh, my God.

170
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,040
Oh!

171
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,040
Oh, my God.

172
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,040
This is terrifying.

173
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,040
Oh, we can...

174
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,040
What do we do?

175
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,279
What do we do?

176
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:31,279
What do we do?

177
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:32,279
What do we do?

178
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:34,100
I'm running.

179
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,100
I can't shoot that far.

180
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:36,529
Oh, my God.

181
00:08:36,529 --> 00:08:37,529
Oh, he's going like getting Jerma.

182
00:08:37,529 --> 00:08:38,529
How does this work?

183
00:08:38,529 --> 00:08:39,529
Oh, my God.

184
00:08:39,529 --> 00:08:40,529
Come on.

185
00:08:40,529 --> 00:08:41,529
Come at me, Belial.

186
00:08:41,529 --> 00:08:42,529
You are the Lord of Lies.

187
00:08:42,529 --> 00:08:43,529
I'm dead.

188
00:08:43,529 --> 00:08:44,529
Lord of Lies?

189
00:08:44,529 --> 00:08:45,529
What the hell?

190
00:08:45,529 --> 00:08:46,529
Yeah, I'll just whirlwind his ass.

191
00:08:46,529 --> 00:08:48,409
Can I be revived mid-combat?

192
00:08:48,409 --> 00:08:49,409
No, you can't.

193
00:08:49,409 --> 00:08:50,409
I think you can.

194
00:08:50,409 --> 00:08:51,409
Can you?

195
00:08:51,409 --> 00:08:52,409
I think somebody needs to be a monk jumping.

196
00:08:52,409 --> 00:08:53,409
Oh, nice.

197
00:08:53,409 --> 00:08:54,409
Bring him back.

198
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:55,409
There you go.

199
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:56,409
Oh, dead.

200
00:08:56,409 --> 00:08:58,220
Insta-dead.

201
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:59,220
Don't stay in the poison.

202
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:00,220
Don't stay in the poison.

203
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:01,220
Jerma, give me up.

204
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:02,220
You have the most health.

205
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:03,220
You can get me.

206
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:04,220
101.

207
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:05,220
What the hell?

208
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,220
Hold on.

209
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:07,220
I'm getting somebody.

210
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:08,220
I'm getting somebody.

211
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:09,220
I don't know who it is.

212
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:10,220
I'm doing it again.

213
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:11,220
Here we go.

214
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:12,220
I am running for my life.

215
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:13,220
Hold on.

216
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,220
Use your potions.

217
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,360
Oh, my God.

218
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,360
You guys are all dying instantly.

219
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:22,820
Just running for my life.

220
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:23,820
You ain't got nothing.

221
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:24,820
Oh, I blocked it.

222
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:27,220
Oh, my good God.

223
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:38,379
It looks like my bubble's actually getting him.

224
00:09:38,379 --> 00:09:41,379
Yeah, I think as long as you're on the outskirts, you can hit him.

225
00:09:41,379 --> 00:09:42,679
Oh, he had better.

226
00:09:42,679 --> 00:09:43,679
He had better.

227
00:09:44,679 --> 00:09:45,679
That almost killed me.

228
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:48,679
Oh, oh, oh, no, no, no, please.

229
00:09:48,679 --> 00:09:52,179
Fortunately, ice armor is totally balanced.

230
00:09:52,179 --> 00:09:53,179
And fair.

231
00:09:53,179 --> 00:09:54,179
Legendary.

232
00:09:54,179 --> 00:09:55,179
Legendary.

233
00:09:55,179 --> 00:09:56,179
Oh, come on.

234
00:09:56,179 --> 00:09:57,179
What's he got?

235
00:09:57,179 --> 00:09:58,179
We got nothing.

236
00:09:58,179 --> 00:09:59,480
Holy shit.

237
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,480
Oh, that's cool.

238
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,480
Oh, I see.

239
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,779
No, no.

240
00:10:02,779 --> 00:10:03,779
We got a rare H.

241
00:10:03,779 --> 00:10:05,149
We got a rare H.

242
00:10:05,149 --> 00:10:06,149
Oh, I see.

243
00:10:06,149 --> 00:10:07,899
We got a rare H.

244
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:08,899
Oh, we got a rare H.

245
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:09,899
Oh, I see.

246
00:10:09,899 --> 00:10:10,899
Oh, I see.

247
00:10:10,899 --> 00:10:11,899
Oh, I see.

248
00:10:11,899 --> 00:10:12,899
Oh, I see.

249
00:10:12,899 --> 00:10:13,899
Oh, I see.

250
00:10:13,899 --> 00:10:14,899
Oh, I see.

251
00:10:14,899 --> 00:10:15,899
We got a rare H.

252
00:10:17,909 --> 00:10:19,149
I was really hoping for something.

253
00:10:19,149 --> 00:10:20,149
I got three yellows.

254
00:10:21,389 --> 00:10:22,389
Damn.

255
00:10:22,389 --> 00:10:23,389
Well, that was cool, though.

256
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:26,389
I got two yellows and like three blues.

257
00:10:26,389 --> 00:10:27,389
Derma gives him nothing.

258
00:10:27,389 --> 00:10:30,629
I got a couple of yellows, but you know, whatevs.

259
00:10:30,629 --> 00:10:31,629
Whatevs.
