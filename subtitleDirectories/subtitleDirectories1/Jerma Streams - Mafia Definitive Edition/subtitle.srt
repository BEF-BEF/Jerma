1
00:00:01,399 --> 00:00:05,900
Why did that just change back to Saw?

2
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:10,060
Oh, it's cause my streamlabs thing, it just took the stream from yesterday and said,

3
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:12,660
this is the stream that's today!

4
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:15,220
No, I got it, I got it, I updated it, I got it.

5
00:00:15,220 --> 00:01:04,420
Alright, I'm not supposed to be here, I- hold on, beer B.

6
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:07,459
Okay, cool.

7
00:01:07,459 --> 00:01:11,129
Does Saw again? It really shouldn't say Saw.

8
00:01:11,129 --> 00:01:15,400
It should say... City.

9
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:18,540
Does it really matter?

10
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:22,569
Does it actually- I- okay, when you- think about a title.

11
00:01:22,569 --> 00:01:25,370
Who am I trying to grab right now?

12
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:27,530
Am I trying to grab you?

13
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:29,930
Am I trying to have a cool title for you to come to the stream and be like,

14
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:34,379
whoa, that's a crazy title, I gotta cl- no, it's just a city, we're in a city.

15
00:01:34,379 --> 00:01:36,219
You know what you're gonna get here.

16
00:01:36,219 --> 00:01:39,420
I'm gonna crash the car five times in the first ten minutes.

17
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:42,969
I'm gonna run somebody over, I'm gonna punch somebody in the face and get out of the car.

18
00:01:42,969 --> 00:01:44,969
And then the car's gonna explode.

19
00:01:44,969 --> 00:01:47,209
And then I'm gonna have to restart the game four times.

20
00:01:47,209 --> 00:01:50,090
Like, do I really need a title for that?

21
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:53,799
I mean, if I could do that for the title, I would do that.

22
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:55,000
No, you know what? No.

23
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,849
Fuck that. I ain't gonna do that today.

24
00:01:57,849 --> 00:02:00,810
I'm gonna- in the first ten minutes, we're gonna do the first mission.

25
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:02,329
I'm not gonna do anything weird.

26
00:02:02,329 --> 00:02:06,730
I'm sorry. All right, let's go.

27
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:11,300
I don't know why I did that. I'm sorry. I don't know why I did that.

28
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:13,539
That was so awful. That was evil.

29
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:17,159
Hey, is this a controller game, by the way?

30
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:19,669
He's amped up.

31
00:02:24,219 --> 00:02:25,340
Evil Cloud.

32
00:02:28,139 --> 00:02:29,419
I am actually a little amped up.

33
00:02:31,699 --> 00:02:32,900
I'm looking forward to this.

34
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:39,509
Guys, we get excited on this channel for third-person punching driving games.

35
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:42,969
This is like my favorite thing in the world.

36
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:50,020
But I'd like to answer my question if I could get an answer to that question.

37
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:53,240
Is this a controller game?

38
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:54,840
Or keyboard and mouse?

39
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,599
I'm assuming it's probably controller, right?

40
00:02:56,599 --> 00:02:57,319
Third-person?

41
00:02:58,569 --> 00:03:00,009
Yeah, it's definitely a third-person game.

42
00:03:00,009 --> 00:03:01,129
So I'm gonna use the controller.

43
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:05,379
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, definitely controller.

44
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:09,460
Great. Are you guys ready for Mafia?

45
00:03:12,979 --> 00:03:14,340
How's that sound? Does that sound too low?

46
00:03:19,689 --> 00:03:20,729
Nice and rainy out today.

47
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:24,340
You know, actually, I kind of missed this.

48
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:30,300
It hasn't rained in Vegas in probably, I don't know, wait.

49
00:03:31,099 --> 00:03:32,379
Can my computer not run this game?

50
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:33,979
I think I just got a warning.

51
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:40,900
I think OBS just gave me a warning saying that the encoding was too high.

52
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:41,780
Can I not run this?

53
00:03:42,949 --> 00:03:45,419
Uh-oh. Find out.

54
00:03:48,939 --> 00:03:51,099
How much CPU is too much CPU to use for a game?

55
00:03:53,289 --> 00:03:54,409
I gotta turn something down here.

56
00:03:54,409 --> 00:03:55,210
All right, options.

57
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:56,330
All right, yeah, we gotta turn this down.

58
00:03:56,969 --> 00:03:59,030
Stream is experiencing issues.

59
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:03,189
Fuck. Okay, hold on.

60
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:05,509
Hold on, I think I can fix this.

61
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:11,780
How bad does it look right now?

62
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:12,500
Is it all right now?

63
00:04:13,219 --> 00:04:16,230
All right, display.

64
00:04:17,029 --> 00:04:17,990
Yep, the field is off.

65
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:21,589
Which one of these is taking up a ton of CPU power?

66
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:25,180
It's a budget PC.

67
00:04:25,899 --> 00:04:28,230
Yeah, guys, I have a 1080 in here.

68
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:30,230
I haven't upgraded my computer in six years.

69
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:32,329
Is that bad?

70
00:04:32,329 --> 00:04:33,449
That 1080 is still fine.

71
00:04:34,709 --> 00:04:35,750
Shadow quality low.

72
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:40,139
Yeah, that's probably that's what was hogging all the CPU.

73
00:04:40,779 --> 00:04:44,220
It's not a pre-built, please.

74
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:45,579
At least give me a little bit of credit.

75
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:47,980
Somebody else built it for me.

76
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:51,589
What else should I turn off?

77
00:04:52,149 --> 00:04:58,420
Everything else should be fine.

78
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:00,819
What about volumetric effects?

79
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:03,639
I think it should be fine.

80
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:05,850
All right, let's go.

81
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:06,329
Back it up.

82
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:11,480
Carcyclopedia.

83
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,319
Motion blur?

84
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:14,199
I turned it off, didn't I?

85
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,310
Yeah, motion blur is off.

86
00:05:17,029 --> 00:05:18,550
Who the hell wants motion blur in their game?

87
00:05:19,189 --> 00:05:19,829
All right, you ready?

88
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:22,600
I'm not going to go back and do Ratatouille again.

89
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,800
I ate the disk.

90
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,800
I ground it up and do a fucking spaghetti grinder,

91
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,319
and I put it into pasta.

92
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:29,220
Put vegetation on high.

93
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:31,459
Let's just see if this Walmart PC can handle it.

94
00:05:31,459 --> 00:05:32,339
Story mode, here we go.

95
00:05:32,339 --> 00:05:33,779
Medium, classic, hard mode.

96
00:05:36,009 --> 00:05:36,250
No.

97
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:38,790
Players who want a fair fight.

98
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:40,069
There is low aim assistance.

99
00:05:40,069 --> 00:05:41,670
Police respond to fewer crimes.

100
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:43,269
Enemies are more dangerous.

101
00:05:43,269 --> 00:05:44,550
Police will respond to more crimes.

102
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:45,750
Fewer UI indicators.

103
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:46,470
Classic.

104
00:05:47,189 --> 00:05:48,839
Enemies are lethal.

105
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:50,600
Police respond to more crimes.

106
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,480
Fewer UI.

107
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:54,680
And ammunition left in the clip is lost when reloading.

108
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,240
No thanks.

109
00:05:56,040 --> 00:06:00,220
No thanks.

110
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,939
Play classic.

111
00:06:03,939 --> 00:06:05,220
No, I'm not doing classic.

112
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:06,339
I'm terrible.

113
00:06:06,339 --> 00:06:08,100
I'm not going to get past the first boss.

114
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:14,660
Can I change it in the game?

115
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:15,620
Can I change it mid-game?

116
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:18,259
Enemies are lethal.

117
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:22,649
This is...

118
00:06:22,649 --> 00:06:24,329
Am I playing stalker?

119
00:06:24,329 --> 00:06:25,370
Why is this even in here?

120
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:32,009
No manual transmission.

121
00:06:32,009 --> 00:06:33,050
Tutorials, that's fine.

122
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:33,930
You can show them.

123
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:34,649
Here we go.

124
00:06:37,699 --> 00:06:38,740
No, no, don't, no.

125
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:43,610
Game is piss easy on anything below classic.

126
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:44,970
Yeah, but I don't want to...

127
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:47,050
I don't care about how hard the game is.

128
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:48,649
I just want to drive around.

129
00:06:48,649 --> 00:06:49,769
Hey, this is not a...

130
00:06:49,769 --> 00:06:53,129
Look, maybe five, 10 years ago I would have cared about that.

131
00:06:53,689 --> 00:06:56,709
Now I just want to hear the rain hit the side of my window

132
00:06:56,709 --> 00:06:57,829
and the thunder.

133
00:06:57,829 --> 00:06:59,939
Guys, I want to be able to just...

134
00:06:59,939 --> 00:07:00,259
You know what?

135
00:07:00,259 --> 00:07:02,500
I'm just going to turn this on at night later tonight

136
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,300
and just sleep to this.

137
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:05,829
This shit, I don't have to pay any more extra money.

138
00:07:05,829 --> 00:07:07,350
I already paid $40 for that.

139
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:15,100
Here comes 2K presents.

140
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:17,420
Fucking 2K.

141
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:18,620
WWE Battlegrounds.

142
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:19,259
Get the fuck out of here.

143
00:07:19,259 --> 00:07:19,980
The game's stupid.

144
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:21,899
I'm already angry.

145
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:23,019
All right, I'm going to be quiet.

146
00:07:23,019 --> 00:07:51,259
I'm just waiting for one of these birds

147
00:07:51,259 --> 00:07:54,620
to just crash into the camera that is our view

148
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:56,300
and it's Borderlands 4.

149
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:58,300
And then no rest for the wicked starts playing again.

150
00:07:58,939 --> 00:08:17,370
This looks pretty good.

151
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:19,980
This looks good.

152
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:21,259
This looks really good.

153
00:08:21,899 --> 00:08:24,089
Come on, my computer sucks.

154
00:08:24,089 --> 00:08:24,730
I can't handle it.

155
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:26,250
But it's still like it's a little choppy for me.

156
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:27,370
But it should be all right.

157
00:08:40,259 --> 00:08:41,059
Pre-rendered.

158
00:08:41,059 --> 00:08:44,710
Oh, now you got my hopes up.

159
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:50,500
I'm just an annoying fucking drone.

160
00:08:54,059 --> 00:08:55,980
That's the neighborhood kid with his fucking drone.

161
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,169
Watch out.

162
00:08:58,169 --> 00:09:04,009
It goes by somebody's head.

163
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:05,690
Turns around.

164
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:07,769
The guy's got a huge bald spot on the top of his head.

165
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:11,940
You little bastard.

166
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:25,029
This is really fucking loud.

167
00:09:25,029 --> 00:09:26,070
It's a cut scene loud.

168
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:26,470
Don't worry.

169
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:27,350
It'll be all right in a minute.

170
00:09:28,149 --> 00:09:30,659
Oh, shit.

171
00:09:30,659 --> 00:09:31,539
Lost another drone.

172
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,320
Lost another one.

173
00:09:34,039 --> 00:09:51,159
You know what's the saddest part about this video

174
00:09:51,159 --> 00:09:52,039
that we're watching right now

175
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:53,720
that was filmed on one of those drones?

176
00:09:54,519 --> 00:09:56,299
It's unbelievable.

177
00:09:56,299 --> 00:09:56,460
Wow.

178
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:57,500
What cinematography?

179
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:57,980
How beautiful.

180
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:58,779
You're gonna scroll down.

181
00:09:59,659 --> 00:10:00,779
840 views.

182
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:15,019
Somebody said, you are so funny.

183
00:10:15,019 --> 00:10:15,820
Ban that person.

184
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:17,259
I don't want to see them again.

185
00:10:17,259 --> 00:10:18,620
Or at least a minute.

186
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:27,460
You think I was gonna catch you say that?

187
00:10:28,179 --> 00:10:30,100
Hey, I only pick up the negative comments.

188
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:30,820
I'm a streamer.

189
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:34,620
I don't see any positive comments.

190
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,220
I see four messages an hour.

191
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:01,450
All right.

192
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:02,330
I can't talk.

193
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:03,049
No more talking.

194
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:05,370
I had something to say there, but be quiet.

195
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:20,539
I'm not looking for any associates.

196
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,860
It's a fucking huge hands.

197
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:24,620
Because I'm on the net.

198
00:11:25,899 --> 00:11:27,179
Can't even pay for the coffee.

199
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:30,809
But I got plenty to trade.

200
00:11:30,809 --> 00:11:32,620
Well, that's yours.

201
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:35,850
How long you've been in town?

202
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:36,649
Three years.

203
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:39,450
Caught my teeth in Empire Bay.

204
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:41,690
Well, they handed you the Morello case.

205
00:11:42,649 --> 00:11:43,529
Right out of the gate.

206
00:11:44,649 --> 00:11:47,480
Just want him to keep lighting cigarettes.

207
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,879
Just have like 12 cigarettes lit on the table.

208
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:51,879
They just keep picking up different ones

209
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:52,919
and smoking them.

210
00:11:52,919 --> 00:11:54,759
Case must be getting pretty cold by now.

211
00:11:55,399 --> 00:11:57,980
Or you got something might warm it up.

212
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:00,620
Yeah, I might have some.

213
00:12:01,419 --> 00:12:03,019
I don't know what's my end of the deal.

214
00:12:03,019 --> 00:12:04,539
Uh, you want money?

215
00:12:04,539 --> 00:12:06,220
Some sort of immunity.

216
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:08,220
They didn't even care whose was whose.

217
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:09,580
I got people I need to protect.

218
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:12,539
Please.

219
00:12:12,539 --> 00:12:14,059
Always the Achilles heel.

220
00:12:14,059 --> 00:12:14,299
All right.

221
00:12:14,299 --> 00:12:17,899
I'm gonna write a sick mom or a wife and a better kid.

222
00:12:17,899 --> 00:12:18,700
Wife and daughter.

223
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:21,240
No one else to watch your back.

224
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,919
I'm guessing you wouldn't be here otherwise.

225
00:12:23,639 --> 00:12:24,200
Pity that.

226
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:28,600
I always said a man needs friends if he's going to survive in this world.

227
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,039
Yeah.

228
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:35,159
Well, in my world, it's the other way around.

229
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:39,830
I have no idea what's happening.

230
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:42,710
All I know is cigarettes in town for a few days.

231
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:43,509
Cigarettes.

232
00:12:43,509 --> 00:12:45,750
Not until I hear what you're trading.

233
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:51,720
So are you talking or are you just killing time before they come for you?

234
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:54,470
You think I'm on the run?

235
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:55,750
Oh, I know it, Tommy.

236
00:12:56,309 --> 00:12:57,429
Jesus, look at you.

237
00:12:58,309 --> 00:12:59,190
Surely gassed.

238
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:00,309
You haven't slept for days.

239
00:13:01,429 --> 00:13:04,870
Your neck's gotta be aching from all that looking over your shoulder you're doing.

240
00:13:05,669 --> 00:13:10,230
No, the way I figure it is you got someone powerful mean on your tail and they ain't

241
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:12,389
The annoying friend at the movie theater.

242
00:13:13,929 --> 00:13:15,929
You walk out that door without maybe both.

243
00:13:15,929 --> 00:13:17,690
No, you're not making it five steps.

244
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:24,009
Boss, yeah, you stick around.

245
00:13:24,009 --> 00:13:28,809
You tell me your story and maybe you got a shot at living long enough to walk that

246
00:13:28,809 --> 00:13:30,090
girl yours down the aisle.

247
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:34,940
Either way, it looks like I'm buying you a cup of coffee.

248
00:13:35,659 --> 00:13:42,710
Chris, I don't know how everything got so balled up.

249
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:44,120
I know exactly what you're talking about, too.

250
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,360
No one ever sees the hairpin until it's too late.

251
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:49,639
Your friend is talking during the previews and you're like,

252
00:13:49,639 --> 00:13:51,480
I hope he shuts the fuck up when the movie starts.

253
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:54,519
And the movie starts, the first one minute goes by, he's still talking to you.

254
00:13:54,519 --> 00:13:56,360
It's like, god damn it, man.

255
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,799
We're both here for the same reason.

256
00:13:57,799 --> 00:13:58,519
Please don't.

257
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:02,299
That's me right now.

258
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:06,250
What a hypocrite.

259
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:07,529
This isn't even a fucking movie.

260
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:08,649
All right.

261
00:14:08,649 --> 00:14:09,610
I got a rebuttal to that.

262
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:12,250
I'm the 12th streamer you've seen play this game.

263
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:13,370
I'm like five days late.

264
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:18,139
It was at the end of one of those shifts when I first met Polly and Sam.

265
00:14:21,019 --> 00:14:22,360
I was loud.

266
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:25,740
I don't watch anyone else.

267
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:26,460
Oh shit.

268
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:27,659
Well, I'll be quiet.

269
00:14:28,539 --> 00:14:30,019
We've waited for you.

270
00:14:32,019 --> 00:14:35,289
Oh, it's too loud.

271
00:14:36,009 --> 00:14:40,330
Imagine being in a movie theater.

272
00:14:41,529 --> 00:14:42,330
It's too loud.

273
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:43,210
It's too loud.

274
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:44,169
It's supposed to be loud.

275
00:14:44,169 --> 00:14:45,289
You fucking asshole.

276
00:14:45,289 --> 00:14:45,850
Shut up.

277
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:46,889
It's THX.

278
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,929
Oh, okay.

279
00:15:06,649 --> 00:15:08,090
Let me break your immersion for a second.

280
00:15:08,809 --> 00:15:09,049
Sorry.

281
00:15:09,049 --> 00:15:11,129
This doesn't happen in movies, but it's happening here.

282
00:15:14,389 --> 00:15:15,750
Is that what infinity war starts?

283
00:15:17,049 --> 00:15:18,250
I know it's like the loop.

284
00:15:30,789 --> 00:15:34,470
Who's so desperately the all right.

285
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:35,429
How do I how do I drive?

286
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:37,909
All right.

287
00:15:37,909 --> 00:15:38,870
Where are we going?

288
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:40,389
Find ways to lose your tail.

289
00:15:41,909 --> 00:15:42,950
I don't have any tutorials.

290
00:15:48,419 --> 00:15:48,980
Oh, there we go.

291
00:15:55,299 --> 00:15:56,740
I feel like I'm driving a toy car.

292
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:00,600
Is that us?

293
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,519
Hold LT to slow down.

294
00:16:06,519 --> 00:16:07,080
Yeah, break.

295
00:16:09,429 --> 00:16:10,470
Root to destination is shown.

296
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:13,669
Wait, we have GPS in like the 1930s.

297
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:17,269
That's kind of all right.

298
00:16:17,269 --> 00:16:19,830
I'm glad that that would remake like hell.

299
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:21,509
We're back.

300
00:16:21,509 --> 00:16:23,059
I'll wake up the doc.

301
00:16:23,059 --> 00:16:23,620
I don't know.

302
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:24,419
It might be okay.

303
00:16:25,059 --> 00:16:26,580
He's getting the call anyways.

304
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:27,700
The graphics are too good.

305
00:16:28,659 --> 00:16:29,940
You don't get to listen either.

306
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:30,580
It's hard to drive.

307
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:32,259
The graphics are too good.

308
00:16:32,259 --> 00:16:32,899
So do that.

309
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:41,139
I'm turning the graphics on low.

310
00:16:41,139 --> 00:16:42,580
I actually it's hard to do this.

311
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:44,340
Where am I taking you once we're over the bridge?

312
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:46,740
I'm getting tired out of questions.

313
00:16:47,299 --> 00:16:48,580
Drive to central island.

314
00:16:49,379 --> 00:16:51,450
Can I change the camera angle?

315
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:53,769
Turn limiter off.

316
00:16:53,769 --> 00:16:54,250
What?

317
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:55,370
How do I change the camera angle?

318
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:56,330
I don't like this view.

319
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:57,289
I want to be a little closer.

320
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:06,440
What?

321
00:17:08,259 --> 00:17:10,420
I know some shortcuts that'll slow them down.

322
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:11,779
I don't care how you do it.

323
00:17:11,779 --> 00:17:12,259
What happened?

324
00:17:12,259 --> 00:17:13,539
Shake them off.

325
00:17:13,539 --> 00:17:14,579
Lose your tail.

326
00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:15,619
Is encoding lag?

327
00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:16,819
No, it's my computer.

328
00:17:16,819 --> 00:17:18,579
Actually, we're going to have to turn the graphics down.

329
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:25,640
1080T omega lol.

330
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,000
8 omega lol.

331
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,670
These guys really don't like it, do they?

332
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:30,869
No, I said I wasn't going to hit anybody.

333
00:17:30,869 --> 00:17:31,369
Good.

334
00:17:33,369 --> 00:17:33,930
Master Shake?

335
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:37,690
All right.

336
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:39,049
Find ways to lose your tail.

337
00:17:39,049 --> 00:17:39,450
Hold on.

338
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:40,089
It's still wait.

339
00:17:40,089 --> 00:17:41,609
We're going to figure this out right now.

340
00:17:41,609 --> 00:17:42,569
Hold on.

341
00:17:42,569 --> 00:17:44,900
It's still fucking too loud.

342
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:47,940
And we got to put it on a little bit lower than this.

343
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:49,940
Geometry detail can put it on medium.

344
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:51,460
Decal is low.

345
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:52,259
Medium.

346
00:17:52,259 --> 00:17:56,309
Look, you don't order a rare steak.

347
00:17:56,309 --> 00:17:57,589
You don't order a well-done steak.

348
00:17:57,589 --> 00:17:59,670
You order a fucking medium steak.

349
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:01,829
That's my reasoning for this.

350
00:18:06,839 --> 00:18:07,400
Better?

351
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,039
I don't know.

352
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:15,019
What do you mean you don't order a medium steak?

353
00:18:15,019 --> 00:18:15,819
That's what everybody does.

354
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:32,660
Okay, that was pretty funny.

355
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:33,619
I have to do that again?

356
00:18:33,619 --> 00:18:35,059
What happens if I back through it?

357
00:18:39,079 --> 00:18:39,960
It is Master Shake.

358
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:40,759
It's the same actor?

359
00:18:52,569 --> 00:18:53,069
It is.

360
00:18:54,329 --> 00:18:56,299
What's his name?

361
00:18:56,299 --> 00:18:57,099
Dana Carvey?

362
00:18:57,099 --> 00:18:58,059
No, not Dana Carvey.

363
00:18:58,059 --> 00:18:58,539
What's his name?

364
00:18:59,259 --> 00:19:00,299
All right, hold on.

365
00:19:00,299 --> 00:19:01,099
I have to try something.

366
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:10,710
Come on, do it.

367
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:17,690
Yes.

368
00:19:23,619 --> 00:19:27,099
Video games.

369
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:28,779
Aren't they great?

370
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:33,190
Oh shit.

371
00:19:33,829 --> 00:19:36,819
Didn't kill anybody.

372
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:38,259
Don't shoot that lady.

373
00:19:38,259 --> 00:19:38,740
What are you doing?

374
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,559
Custom character creator, is there?

375
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:51,769
All right, I don't want to do it yet

376
00:19:51,769 --> 00:19:53,529
because we're right at the end of the mission.

377
00:19:53,529 --> 00:19:55,930
But if I hit triangle, or why?

378
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:57,049
Will I just fall out of the car?

379
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:04,579
That's Carl.

380
00:20:04,579 --> 00:20:06,339
That was Carl from Aqua Teen.

381
00:20:06,339 --> 00:20:08,019
It's Aqua Teen Mafia Force.

382
00:20:18,619 --> 00:20:19,119
Did it.

383
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:21,630
Now your night's not over.

384
00:20:22,269 --> 00:20:25,119
I hope somebody just chimes in and just say,

385
00:20:25,119 --> 00:20:27,200
yeah, let's get over there, man.

386
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,000
You think he squealed?

387
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:28,880
It's me, me.

388
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:29,119
Wrong.

389
00:20:29,119 --> 00:20:30,640
I think you zip it tight.

390
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,160
We'll talk it through back at the bar.

391
00:20:33,849 --> 00:20:35,769
That'd be so awesome if there's a guy that talks like that

392
00:20:35,769 --> 00:20:37,450
that's in my friend group.

393
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:38,250
Hold on.

394
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:38,970
I don't like this.

395
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:40,890
Did I change this?

396
00:20:41,529 --> 00:20:42,970
Hold on a second.

397
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:44,890
There we are.

398
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:46,170
Okay, vehicle camera pitch.

399
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:47,049
Does that make it better?

400
00:20:47,049 --> 00:20:48,170
I didn't think that didn't do anything.

401
00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:49,690
I made it worse.

402
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:58,960
1080 Ti.

403
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:02,009
Should I put this at 720p?

404
00:21:04,619 --> 00:21:05,259
Shit, my light.

405
00:21:05,259 --> 00:21:05,819
Wait.

406
00:21:05,819 --> 00:21:07,500
I don't have a graphics card update.

407
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,500
I haven't updated my drivers in probably three years.

408
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,059
Should I do that?

409
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:20,779
Clock the frame rate to 30.

410
00:21:22,059 --> 00:21:22,559
We'll see.

411
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:35,289
Is it CPU or GPU?

412
00:21:37,079 --> 00:21:39,000
It seems, during cut scenes it's fine.

413
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,640
But just driving really fast is when my computer starts to hang a little.

414
00:21:42,279 --> 00:21:55,019
Do a driver update.

415
00:21:55,019 --> 00:21:56,859
But if I do a driver update, the screen turns off.

416
00:21:57,420 --> 00:22:00,509
CPU is the problem.

417
00:22:00,509 --> 00:22:01,390
Yeah, probably.

418
00:22:14,809 --> 00:22:23,240
Don't do a Smash Brothers thing.

419
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:24,440
I did already.

420
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:46,680
I've refreshed the page and I got a Travis Scott burger advertisement.

421
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:48,210
Yes.

422
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:50,910
That's one of four ads on Twitch right now.

423
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:55,559
Hey, you want to go to McDonald's and get a hamburger with bacon on it?

424
00:22:56,730 --> 00:22:57,230
We'll get it.

425
00:23:01,319 --> 00:23:03,240
Anyone ask where you got that money?

426
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,359
You wanted a poker.

427
00:23:04,359 --> 00:23:07,920
Scratches on your car?

428
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:10,779
You swerved.

429
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:13,789
To keep from hitting a little old lady.

430
00:23:13,789 --> 00:23:14,990
You got it?

431
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:15,789
That actually did happen.

432
00:23:15,789 --> 00:23:16,990
I just barely missed her.

433
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:19,869
Somebody bullet holes.

434
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,720
Wait, that's a different franchise.

435
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:36,029
When I opened the envelope...

436
00:23:36,029 --> 00:23:36,670
That was pretty good.

437
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:37,710
...I had a heart attack.

438
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:39,440
Fixed the cap.

439
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:43,599
Nearly enough to buy a new one.

440
00:23:43,599 --> 00:23:45,599
Thought about what Sam said about work.

441
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,119
I wasn't interested.

442
00:23:47,839 --> 00:23:49,339
The money was good, sure.

443
00:23:50,299 --> 00:23:52,170
I didn't want to get in with criminals.

444
00:23:52,170 --> 00:23:56,009
I just wanted to open the fridge and there's like a hundred packs of cigarettes in the fridge.

445
00:23:56,809 --> 00:23:57,529
And the freezer.

446
00:23:57,529 --> 00:23:59,130
So, right there.

447
00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:07,259
Back then, I was out.

448
00:24:07,259 --> 00:24:09,339
Hey, Chris Weed Piano, thanks for $50.

449
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:12,299
5,000 bits from Chris Weed Piano.

450
00:24:12,299 --> 00:24:14,779
Jerma, could you tell me now when you're doing Weed Week?

451
00:24:14,779 --> 00:24:16,960
There's no such thing.

452
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,519
That's a lot of money.

453
00:24:18,519 --> 00:24:20,640
Thanks for the 50 bucks, dude.

454
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,799
That's a fucking extreme amount of money.

455
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:27,900
All right, 1930.

456
00:24:30,359 --> 00:24:32,680
After that night with Salieri's guys,

457
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,519
I was back working as soon as I could.

458
00:24:35,559 --> 00:24:36,440
But it felt different.

459
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,799
I think it's the lighting.

460
00:24:37,799 --> 00:24:38,680
I gotta turn the lights down.

461
00:24:46,619 --> 00:24:49,740
I need to get a fucking 3080.

462
00:24:55,950 --> 00:24:56,750
All right, here we go.

463
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:57,710
First time on foot.

464
00:24:57,710 --> 00:24:58,670
What's the punch button?

465
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:02,119
All right, wait a minute, wait.

466
00:25:02,759 --> 00:25:03,900
Hold on, lady.

467
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:07,099
I'm currently trying to get my graphics to look okay.

468
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:12,200
I'm gonna turn on V-sync.

469
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,680
I'm gonna drop the FOV to like 85.

470
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:18,880
I'm gonna put the vegetation,

471
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:22,059
direct lighting below.

472
00:25:22,059 --> 00:25:22,779
All right, there we go.

473
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:23,920
There we go.

474
00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:28,009
That's pretty smooth.

475
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:30,569
That's pretty smooth.

476
00:25:30,569 --> 00:25:31,289
I'm ready.

477
00:25:31,289 --> 00:25:40,890
So where to?

478
00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:42,490
St. Michael's Church.

479
00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:44,329
All right, St. Michael's Church.

480
00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:47,609
Careful, please.

481
00:25:48,170 --> 00:25:49,529
I always drive careful.

482
00:25:49,529 --> 00:25:50,730
Then you'd be the first.

483
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,400
Turn the speed limiter on.

484
00:25:54,269 --> 00:25:55,630
Why would I want to put the speed limiter?

485
00:25:55,630 --> 00:25:57,470
Motorcycle, motorcycle, motorcycle, motorcycle.

486
00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:02,829
Oh, wait, I was doing a mission, right?

487
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,640
I can't do that with a lady in the car.

488
00:26:09,609 --> 00:26:10,809
A cab driver is like,

489
00:26:10,809 --> 00:26:13,710
oh, yeah, take me to 42nd Street, please.

490
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:14,589
Sure thing.

491
00:26:14,589 --> 00:26:16,589
Motorcycle, motorcycle, motorcycle.

492
00:26:16,589 --> 00:26:17,869
And they run the guy over.

493
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:19,920
What a fucking psycho.

494
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,319
So where to?

495
00:26:21,319 --> 00:26:22,839
St. Michael's Church.

496
00:26:22,839 --> 00:26:27,000
Directly.

497
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,119
Careful, please.

498
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:29,559
I always drive careful.

499
00:26:29,559 --> 00:26:30,599
You have to obey the rules.

500
00:26:30,599 --> 00:26:31,880
You'll be the first.

501
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:34,750
Turn on the speed limiter.

502
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:35,630
Oh, I see.

503
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:36,349
I don't want that on.

504
00:26:40,779 --> 00:26:41,579
Get.

505
00:26:41,579 --> 00:26:43,710
I don't honk the horn.

506
00:26:44,349 --> 00:26:53,960
Church, it's Sunday already.

507
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,480
Eyes on the road, please.

508
00:26:59,119 --> 00:26:59,619
No.

509
00:27:01,789 --> 00:27:03,150
My milkshake brings all the...

510
00:27:03,789 --> 00:27:05,390
It's in every fucking game, I think.

511
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:06,509
I can't get away from it.

512
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:15,180
I can't get away from it.

513
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:15,980
What do you want me to say?

514
00:27:16,539 --> 00:27:19,980
A goose laugh?

515
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:38,480
Oh, drive carefully, respect the law.

516
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:43,960
I am.

517
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:44,839
I'm doing a good job.

518
00:27:50,109 --> 00:27:51,069
Game's too good looking.

519
00:27:51,069 --> 00:27:53,470
I like games that have like 2008 graphics,

520
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:54,589
not like 2020.

521
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:57,279
I should just play the original one.

522
00:28:04,039 --> 00:28:06,200
I'm complaining about how it's good it looks

523
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:09,079
and how much it's bad it runs on my computer.

524
00:28:09,079 --> 00:28:10,839
I could just play the original Mafia.

525
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:15,000
I ain't gonna do that, though.

526
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:15,960
Here you go.

527
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:16,680
St. Michael's.

528
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,440
That'll be 30 cents.

529
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,400
The only tip I'll give you is to stop smoking

530
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,119
in your vehicle.

531
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:24,599
I felt like I was sitting in an ashtray.

532
00:28:25,789 --> 00:28:26,670
Sure.

533
00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:27,630
Whatever you say.

534
00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:30,990
I thought everybody smoked in like 1930.

535
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,000
All right.

536
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,880
There is no punch person button.

537
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:51,319
Fair.

538
00:28:51,319 --> 00:28:52,039
Run her over.

539
00:28:52,039 --> 00:28:52,279
I can't.

540
00:28:52,279 --> 00:28:53,240
I'm not just gonna run her over.

541
00:28:53,799 --> 00:28:54,880
All right.

542
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,480
Search the streets for fares.

543
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:56,960
Okay.

544
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,400
This is just crazy taxi.

545
00:28:59,119 --> 00:29:12,670
Is there a person here?

546
00:29:12,670 --> 00:29:13,309
You need a fare?

547
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:18,430
You?

548
00:29:22,519 --> 00:29:23,559
Anybody need a ride?

549
00:29:26,029 --> 00:29:27,069
I'm looking for Dave.

550
00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:29,529
Lift for Dave.

551
00:29:29,529 --> 00:29:32,640
Fucking God damn.

552
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,119
Hey.

553
00:29:33,119 --> 00:29:34,160
Looking for Dave.

554
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:39,720
Your ride has canceled.

555
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:47,720
Oh, wait.

556
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:48,039
They can't...

557
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:50,519
I guess I did that on purpose.

558
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:07,180
Oh, here you are.

559
00:30:10,059 --> 00:30:10,539
Come on in.

560
00:30:11,099 --> 00:30:11,819
Where are you going, sir?

561
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:17,519
Where can I take you?

562
00:30:17,519 --> 00:30:18,240
Art gallery.

563
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,039
Get me there quick.

564
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:19,680
Art gallery.

565
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:20,480
Get there quick.

566
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,440
Quick, I can do.

567
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,740
Is there...

568
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:25,180
Do they have handbrakes back in the 30s?

569
00:30:33,079 --> 00:30:34,440
Didn't turn off the graphics.

570
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:34,920
Oh, right.

571
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:35,160
Hold on.

572
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:35,960
Let me try that.

573
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:51,920
It didn't change anything.

574
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,119
I think it's just a game.

575
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:01,880
Yeah, that didn't change anything.

576
00:31:08,119 --> 00:31:09,400
Turn off the visuals.

577
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,920
I get to be busy.

578
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:13,559
Your busy day is going to be looking at old paintings.

579
00:31:13,559 --> 00:31:14,920
I have a business meeting there with a copy.

580
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,039
It's the driver.

581
00:31:16,039 --> 00:31:17,400
Actually, to be honest, it looks fine.

582
00:31:18,519 --> 00:31:19,079
Yeah, it does.

583
00:31:19,079 --> 00:31:19,960
Maybe you'll understand.

584
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,920
CPU can't handle the game and stream.

585
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:23,640
Yeah, yeah.

586
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:24,599
That can get you.

587
00:31:24,599 --> 00:31:25,079
What the hell?

588
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:26,039
Let's see.

589
00:31:26,039 --> 00:31:27,400
I got a six-core CPU.

590
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:30,200
The thing was expensive back in like 2014.

591
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:38,920
I got to hurry up.

592
00:31:39,559 --> 00:31:45,049
I'm getting...

593
00:31:45,049 --> 00:31:45,690
I'm just up...

594
00:31:45,690 --> 00:31:48,170
I'm upgrading my CPU and GPU and motherboard.

595
00:31:48,170 --> 00:31:49,369
I'm just going to get a new computer or whatever.

596
00:32:01,079 --> 00:32:01,960
I'm going to get like a...

597
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:05,960
I'm going to get a 64-core computer.

598
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:09,660
That just spawned.

599
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:10,779
That taxi just spawned.

600
00:32:11,339 --> 00:32:20,890
All right, get out.

601
00:32:20,890 --> 00:32:22,220
Get the fuck out.

602
00:32:27,579 --> 00:32:32,799
I'm going to do 1080p streams.

603
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:33,119
I don't know.

604
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:33,839
That's a good question.

605
00:32:44,599 --> 00:32:47,319
GTA V runs good on this computer and this looks the same.

606
00:32:48,039 --> 00:32:51,440
This is running fine, but you know, you get the idea.

607
00:32:53,119 --> 00:32:54,160
I'm not going to do 1080p.

608
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:54,960
No, there's no reason to.

609
00:32:56,910 --> 00:32:58,589
GTA V was in 2012.

610
00:32:59,390 --> 00:32:59,869
Yeah, but...

611
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:03,279
Fuck.

612
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:03,759
That's right.

613
00:33:05,359 --> 00:33:05,759
All right.

614
00:33:05,759 --> 00:33:07,200
I'm getting a new computer tomorrow.

615
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,319
I'm getting a new computer tomorrow.

616
00:33:20,319 --> 00:33:21,200
That's impossible.

617
00:33:24,779 --> 00:33:25,259
Great deal.

618
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:28,240
Okay.

619
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:28,960
You can...

620
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:29,680
You can do that.

621
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:31,200
Wait.

622
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,319
Wait, run, run, run, run.

623
00:33:32,319 --> 00:33:32,720
How do you run?

624
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:33,279
How do you sprint?

625
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:38,000
Shit.

626
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:41,720
I'm back.

627
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:42,039
I'm back.

628
00:33:42,039 --> 00:33:42,359
I'm back.

629
00:33:42,359 --> 00:33:42,599
I'm back.

630
00:33:42,599 --> 00:33:43,000
I'm back.

631
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:43,799
So where were we?

632
00:33:46,059 --> 00:33:47,259
Holy shit, dude.

633
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:02,829
He actually waited.

634
00:34:02,829 --> 00:34:02,990
Yeah.

635
00:34:03,630 --> 00:34:05,579
It's a handbrake button.

636
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:11,369
Stop and pay the fine?

637
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:14,889
What fine?

638
00:34:14,889 --> 00:34:15,210
All right.

639
00:34:15,769 --> 00:34:16,730
I'll pay the fine.

640
00:34:16,730 --> 00:34:17,130
How much...

641
00:34:17,130 --> 00:34:17,610
Wait.

642
00:34:17,610 --> 00:34:18,250
Under arrest?

643
00:34:19,210 --> 00:34:21,849
How much is fine?

644
00:34:22,409 --> 00:34:27,929
It's like...

645
00:34:27,929 --> 00:34:28,409
How much is it?

646
00:34:28,409 --> 00:34:29,289
Ten cents?

647
00:34:29,289 --> 00:34:30,090
How much is a fine?

648
00:34:30,730 --> 00:34:37,519
That's a whole dollar.

649
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:41,639
Wait.

650
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:42,440
How much money do I have?

651
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:50,880
How do I get in the car?

652
00:34:52,539 --> 00:34:52,780
Wait.

653
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:53,579
Oh.

654
00:34:57,179 --> 00:34:57,420
All right.

655
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:57,900
You go first.

656
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:59,179
I don't want you to see me do anything illegal.

657
00:35:02,969 --> 00:35:03,769
What's the speed limit?

658
00:35:03,769 --> 00:35:04,090
30?

659
00:35:05,050 --> 00:35:06,519
Oh, shit.

660
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,440
You have to do the speed limit.

661
00:35:13,079 --> 00:35:18,219
That's kind of funny that you can do that.

662
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:20,300
You can put a speed limiter on your car.

663
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:28,079
You know what?

664
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:29,039
It's rendering the buildings.

665
00:35:29,039 --> 00:35:30,239
You don't even render these buildings.

666
00:35:31,039 --> 00:35:33,280
Just make them like bitmap cardboard cutouts

667
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,320
and the game will be fine.

668
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,230
I don't give a shit about the fire exits over there.

669
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:38,590
You can just remove them.

670
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:39,980
It's just unnecessary...

671
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:42,199
Oh.

672
00:35:43,679 --> 00:35:44,800
I beeped at somebody.

673
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:45,760
What?

674
00:35:48,639 --> 00:35:49,679
Beeping is illegal?

675
00:35:51,070 --> 00:35:51,309
No.

676
00:35:51,309 --> 00:35:51,789
Fuck that.

677
00:35:51,789 --> 00:35:52,349
I'm out of here.

678
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:56,480
Oh, shit.

679
00:35:57,119 --> 00:35:58,000
Boiled again.

680
00:35:58,719 --> 00:36:05,289
I beeped at a pedestrian.

681
00:36:06,010 --> 00:36:06,489
All right.

682
00:36:06,489 --> 00:36:06,730
Hold on.

683
00:36:06,730 --> 00:36:07,449
I got to...

684
00:36:07,449 --> 00:36:10,190
Are you kidding me?

685
00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:11,309
Right at the fucking end.

686
00:36:11,309 --> 00:36:14,719
That's disturbing the peace.

687
00:36:14,719 --> 00:36:17,760
So don't ever use your horn.

688
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:22,960
I've been working since 5.

689
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:23,760
So you're telling me...

690
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:24,400
It's your excuse.

691
00:36:26,719 --> 00:36:27,280
Doing this...

692
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:31,230
Where are we going?

693
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:33,230
Is it going to get me arrested?

694
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:34,280
Okay.

695
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:37,079
If I don't tell the cops about the liquor on your breath,

696
00:36:37,079 --> 00:36:38,440
you don't tell them when I break them.

697
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,639
I hear a siren already.

698
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,840
Don't loud noises in 1930.

699
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:45,469
Got any earth today?

700
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:49,099
Never enough of them.

701
00:36:49,099 --> 00:36:51,949
Who's got the money for...

702
00:36:51,949 --> 00:36:53,230
This isn't GTA.

703
00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:54,590
That's true.

704
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:55,550
That's true.

705
00:37:07,039 --> 00:37:07,199
Yeah.

706
00:37:07,199 --> 00:37:08,400
I'm going to stream at 900p.

707
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:12,159
It's going to look crystal clear at 60fps.

708
00:37:13,199 --> 00:37:14,639
I'm going to get a 3090.

709
00:37:14,639 --> 00:37:16,960
I'm going to be a psycho and get a 3090.

710
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:20,159
And the 64 fucking core like 8 gigahertz processor.

711
00:37:20,159 --> 00:37:21,280
I'm going to be able to...

712
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,840
NASA is going to be calling me to fucking CPU usage.

713
00:37:24,639 --> 00:37:32,320
I'm going to be routing like air traffic control to this computer.

714
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:36,599
It's going to be so powerful.

715
00:37:37,159 --> 00:37:41,239
Put the limiter on.

716
00:37:41,239 --> 00:37:41,960
I don't want to get arrested.

717
00:37:45,019 --> 00:37:46,699
It's illegal to drive in this lane, right?

718
00:37:46,699 --> 00:37:47,179
Or is it?

719
00:37:47,179 --> 00:37:52,190
Yeah.

720
00:37:52,190 --> 00:37:53,789
Unkeyball in 4K.

721
00:37:54,429 --> 00:38:00,599
All right.

722
00:38:00,599 --> 00:38:01,239
We're almost there.

723
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:11,949
Let's get a sponsor so you get a free PC.

724
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:15,280
All right.

725
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:17,519
Excuse me.

726
00:38:17,519 --> 00:38:19,119
Uh, can I have a free computer?

727
00:38:20,159 --> 00:38:23,000
I have a streamer.

728
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,719
That means I got a free computer, right?

729
00:38:28,519 --> 00:38:29,639
That's the email I sent.

730
00:38:31,929 --> 00:38:33,929
Hey, uh, I just was hitting you up

731
00:38:33,929 --> 00:38:37,530
because I'm a streamer and deserve a $5,000 PC for free.

732
00:38:38,170 --> 00:38:39,210
Thank you for your time.

733
00:38:39,210 --> 00:38:42,730
I, uh, respectfully yours, Jeremy Albertson.

734
00:38:42,730 --> 00:38:53,880
I don't remember this person.

735
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:58,920
Do I get a bat though?

736
00:38:58,920 --> 00:38:59,960
I'm so excited for the bat.

737
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:19,559
Let's get him.

738
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:30,650
Oh, why to vault?

739
00:39:33,929 --> 00:39:34,329
Nice.

740
00:39:34,329 --> 00:39:34,570
Okay.

741
00:39:34,570 --> 00:39:35,610
Go, go, go, go, go.

742
00:39:38,170 --> 00:39:39,130
I'm on classic mode.

743
00:39:39,130 --> 00:39:39,849
This is not a joke.

744
00:39:40,409 --> 00:39:48,650
We've got YouTube tutorial music in the background.

745
00:39:53,659 --> 00:39:53,980
Run.

746
00:39:54,539 --> 00:40:01,980
By the way, all videos with this song behind it

747
00:40:02,539 --> 00:40:04,059
are less than three minutes long.

748
00:40:05,449 --> 00:40:07,449
They're like two and a half, one and a half minutes long.

749
00:40:07,449 --> 00:40:21,739
It's a quick DIY scripted.

750
00:40:21,739 --> 00:40:22,699
You were supposed to do that.

751
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:30,539
That tripled Joe.

752
00:40:43,659 --> 00:40:45,099
Trying to talk to that cabbie over there.

753
00:40:45,099 --> 00:40:45,579
That's all.

754
00:40:47,130 --> 00:40:48,170
That right.

755
00:40:48,170 --> 00:40:48,489
Yeah.

756
00:40:49,130 --> 00:40:49,610
What is he?

757
00:40:49,610 --> 00:40:50,969
It's a Don's favorite driver.

758
00:40:51,530 --> 00:40:54,570
So anything you got to say to him, you can say to me.

759
00:40:55,289 --> 00:40:55,849
Is that right?

760
00:40:55,849 --> 00:40:57,690
Well, I'll tell you something, pal.

761
00:40:57,690 --> 00:40:58,809
We ain't leaving empty handed.

762
00:40:58,809 --> 00:40:59,690
That's for sure.

763
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:02,090
Well, then maybe you ain't leaving at all.

764
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,880
Bad graphics.

765
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:09,599
Leave me alone.

766
00:41:15,769 --> 00:41:17,289
The lighting is way too hard.

767
00:41:17,289 --> 00:41:18,730
The face animations are bad.

768
00:41:20,619 --> 00:41:21,900
Stop laughing at me.

769
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:23,099
At least we could do.

770
00:41:23,099 --> 00:41:27,179
I'm going to update my graphics card.

771
00:41:27,179 --> 00:41:28,380
I'll be back in like 10 minutes.

772
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:28,619
Yeah.

773
00:41:29,179 --> 00:41:31,130
He's going to want to hear about this.

774
00:41:31,130 --> 00:41:33,130
Why does it look like Toy Story 1?

775
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:36,969
Oh, it doesn't.

776
00:41:36,969 --> 00:41:38,170
It looks like Toy Story 2.

777
00:41:41,199 --> 00:41:42,719
Fucking God damn it.

778
00:41:43,519 --> 00:41:44,480
Okay.

779
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:46,480
You buy my computer.

780
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:47,840
It's going to be a monster.

781
00:41:48,989 --> 00:41:50,269
It's going to be insane.

782
00:41:50,269 --> 00:41:51,230
I've waited long enough.

783
00:41:51,230 --> 00:41:51,949
It's been six years.

784
00:41:51,949 --> 00:41:53,550
It's been five years and five and a half years.

785
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:54,989
I've got to get a new computer or something.

786
00:41:54,989 --> 00:41:56,429
I have to get like a new graphics card.

787
00:41:56,429 --> 00:41:57,469
I can't just have it.

788
00:41:57,469 --> 00:41:58,909
1080 is not going to take me forever.

789
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:01,880
As much as I wanted to.

790
00:42:02,519 --> 00:42:10,809
I can't believe that a 1080 is worthy of Toy Story 1 graphics.

791
00:42:10,809 --> 00:42:11,929
That's fucking crazy.

792
00:42:41,150 --> 00:42:41,469
No, no, no.

793
00:42:41,469 --> 00:42:41,630
Thanks.

794
00:42:41,630 --> 00:42:41,949
No, thanks.

795
00:42:41,949 --> 00:42:43,469
I don't want to learn from a mafia guy.

796
00:42:43,469 --> 00:42:43,869
No, thank you.

797
00:42:43,869 --> 00:42:45,309
I'm not looking for a handout.

798
00:42:45,309 --> 00:42:48,110
This is when you just rip the fuck out of the seat

799
00:42:48,110 --> 00:42:49,309
and run out as fast as you can and run.

800
00:42:49,309 --> 00:42:51,789
I didn't want a shot at the bastards who wrecked my cabin.

801
00:42:51,789 --> 00:42:56,969
You hear that, Frank?

802
00:42:56,969 --> 00:42:59,690
The kid wants my permission.

803
00:42:59,690 --> 00:43:00,409
Yes.

804
00:43:00,409 --> 00:43:05,369
Okay, Tommy Angelo.

805
00:43:05,369 --> 00:43:08,400
All the Morello's girls hang out at a bar he owns.

806
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:09,760
Paul, you know the place.

807
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:11,119
Boss?

808
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:11,840
It's not just you.

809
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:12,320
You're good.

810
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:13,519
You can ride along with Tommy.

811
00:43:13,519 --> 00:43:14,880
This game is really stressful.

812
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:17,449
There's a lot right next to the bar where they park their cars.

813
00:43:17,449 --> 00:43:18,090
Damn.

814
00:43:18,090 --> 00:43:21,760
They'll smash up a few tin cans, send Morello a message.

815
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:24,639
He can't rough up hardworking joes in my neighborhood

816
00:43:24,639 --> 00:43:26,650
without getting a black eye.

817
00:43:26,650 --> 00:43:28,570
Thank you, Mr. Salieri.

818
00:43:28,570 --> 00:43:29,449
I won't let you down.

819
00:43:30,170 --> 00:43:36,539
People with better computers than you have frame rate problems.

820
00:43:36,539 --> 00:43:36,780
Oh.

821
00:43:37,579 --> 00:43:38,780
Oh, so the game sucks.

822
00:43:39,579 --> 00:43:43,840
Okay, let's just check it.

823
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:48,429
I should turn the graphics back up.

824
00:43:48,429 --> 00:43:49,710
It's not just a meat problem.

825
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:59,079
Okay, so there is just frame rate problems in the game.

826
00:43:59,079 --> 00:44:00,039
Okay, I got you.

827
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:02,599
Well, let's go to at least Toy Story 2.

828
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:10,219
Okay, let's do medium.

829
00:44:10,219 --> 00:44:11,340
I'll do medium.

830
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:12,510
But keep lighting.

831
00:44:12,510 --> 00:44:13,630
Fuck lighting.

832
00:44:13,630 --> 00:44:19,070
We're on max?

833
00:44:19,630 --> 00:44:20,840
What are you trying to do to me?

834
00:44:23,769 --> 00:44:24,329
Optimal?

835
00:44:24,889 --> 00:44:31,320
Oh, that looks kind of good.

836
00:44:42,909 --> 00:44:43,630
Look around the bar.

837
00:44:43,630 --> 00:44:44,429
Can I talk to people?

838
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:53,550
Oh, what's this?

839
00:44:54,190 --> 00:44:57,500
Prohibition here to stay.

840
00:44:57,500 --> 00:44:59,340
I pay left.

841
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:03,849
Update your drivers.

842
00:45:04,570 --> 00:45:06,170
But then I have to turn the stream off.

843
00:45:06,170 --> 00:45:07,289
And I don't...

844
00:45:07,289 --> 00:45:08,170
That's going to be a pain in the ass.

845
00:45:09,150 --> 00:45:09,949
Oh, what's this?

846
00:45:15,559 --> 00:45:17,000
We can wait.

847
00:45:17,719 --> 00:45:20,119
Let me just check and see if I have...

848
00:45:20,119 --> 00:45:20,519
Hold on.

849
00:45:21,079 --> 00:45:22,300
Just do it when you have to pee.

850
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:22,940
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

851
00:45:22,940 --> 00:45:23,500
That's what I'll do.

852
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:24,940
When I have to pee, I'm going to update my drivers.

853
00:45:27,340 --> 00:45:28,860
I wonder if it'll turn the stream off.

854
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:29,820
It might not.

855
00:45:29,820 --> 00:45:32,219
It takes like 10 minutes.

856
00:45:32,219 --> 00:45:33,659
Yeah, well, on a break, I'll do it.

857
00:45:33,659 --> 00:45:34,460
Not right now.

858
00:45:34,460 --> 00:45:39,920
That's pretty cool, though.

859
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:43,469
What am I doing?

860
00:45:43,469 --> 00:45:44,750
It said I was looking around the bar.

861
00:45:55,210 --> 00:45:56,409
Going to be a restart anyways.

862
00:45:56,409 --> 00:45:57,289
Shit.

863
00:45:58,599 --> 00:45:58,920
All right.

864
00:46:05,130 --> 00:46:08,409
How does the frame rate get better when I put the graphics on as high as they can go?

865
00:46:08,409 --> 00:46:18,119
Does that make any sense?

866
00:46:18,119 --> 00:46:18,599
Optimal.

867
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:30,000
Turn up the game audio?

868
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:30,320
I will.

869
00:46:34,170 --> 00:46:34,730
Who are you?

870
00:46:35,289 --> 00:46:36,090
What are you doing here?

871
00:46:51,929 --> 00:46:52,170
Yes.

872
00:46:55,789 --> 00:46:56,190
Finally.

873
00:46:59,869 --> 00:47:00,989
Cocktails here.

874
00:47:05,289 --> 00:47:05,690
No, thanks.

875
00:47:05,690 --> 00:47:06,250
I don't drink.

876
00:47:06,250 --> 00:47:07,289
Can you look back and forth?

877
00:47:09,530 --> 00:47:20,429
And everybody does that exact same fake weird laugh.

878
00:47:20,429 --> 00:47:20,670
All right.

879
00:47:20,670 --> 00:47:21,949
I got molotovs.

880
00:47:22,670 --> 00:47:23,710
Wait, there's a thing on the table.

881
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:28,679
Can I have your card?

882
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:31,199
This is pornography.

883
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:34,250
Was it?

884
00:47:34,250 --> 00:47:34,570
I don't know.

885
00:47:34,570 --> 00:47:35,050
I couldn't tell.

886
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:42,079
Guys.

887
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:45,920
Did I ever play the original Mafia?

888
00:47:48,429 --> 00:47:49,789
Like a long time ago.

889
00:47:49,789 --> 00:47:50,030
Yeah.

890
00:47:50,989 --> 00:47:51,869
Not really, though.

891
00:47:52,429 --> 00:47:55,500
I feel like I played it on this stream.

892
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:58,360
I played one of them on this stream, didn't I?

893
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:03,610
Mafia 2?

894
00:48:03,610 --> 00:48:04,010
Mafia 3?

895
00:48:04,010 --> 00:48:04,809
Oh, Mafia 3, yeah.

896
00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:07,119
Hey, Gene.

897
00:48:10,989 --> 00:48:14,489
Get your head out of here.

898
00:48:14,489 --> 00:48:15,530
Fuck you, Papa Polly.

899
00:48:15,530 --> 00:48:18,329
You can't just sneak up on a guy like that.

900
00:48:19,210 --> 00:48:20,760
I'm sorry, Ralphie.

901
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:22,199
I'm just busting your balls.

902
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:26,880
See, you're still a limping.

903
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:29,440
Guess we got two cripples working here.

904
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:31,519
That kind of looks like me.

905
00:48:31,519 --> 00:48:32,639
We ain't nothing alike.

906
00:48:33,789 --> 00:48:34,750
You got that, Ralph?

907
00:48:35,630 --> 00:48:36,670
Sure, Papa Polly.

908
00:48:36,670 --> 00:48:36,909
Yeah.

909
00:48:37,869 --> 00:48:38,269
Tommy.

910
00:48:39,739 --> 00:48:40,460
Tommy Angelo.

911
00:48:41,099 --> 00:48:41,900
Good to meet you.

912
00:48:42,539 --> 00:48:45,579
Like I said, Ralphie here's a crack deck.

913
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:48,059
Well, you bring him a stolen car.

914
00:48:48,059 --> 00:48:48,860
I'll make it yours.

915
00:48:48,860 --> 00:48:50,059
It's only one voice actor?

916
00:48:50,059 --> 00:48:50,460
Tell him to meet.

917
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:51,900
We got a job to do.

918
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:52,780
We need some wheels.

919
00:48:53,659 --> 00:48:55,519
How about this one, Papa Polly?

920
00:48:55,519 --> 00:48:57,679
That would be pretty funny, actually, if it was one person.

921
00:48:57,679 --> 00:48:59,440
It'll get you across to the town.

922
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:00,239
All right.

923
00:49:00,239 --> 00:49:00,719
Let's go.

924
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:02,000
You're driving.

925
00:49:04,829 --> 00:49:07,630
And don't let me catch you loafing off again.

926
00:49:07,630 --> 00:49:09,070
You caught that with one hand.

927
00:49:09,070 --> 00:49:11,070
You do a two-handed clap catch.

928
00:49:11,710 --> 00:49:12,989
That's not cool looking.

929
00:49:12,989 --> 00:49:14,110
You don't look cool doing that.

930
00:49:14,110 --> 00:49:17,159
One day I'm going to cut a line, asshole.

931
00:49:17,159 --> 00:49:17,980
Holy shit.

932
00:49:17,980 --> 00:49:20,619
I don't know what Ralph's trying to pull giving us this motor.

933
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:23,260
I want to show you something about the good life

934
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:25,980
and you're driving something my mom could have bought 20 years ago.

935
00:49:26,619 --> 00:49:29,340
If I know Ralph, he probably got it taken out of our yard.

936
00:49:29,980 --> 00:49:31,420
Hey, the car's fine.

937
00:49:31,420 --> 00:49:33,019
It's good to get a change from the cab.

938
00:49:33,579 --> 00:49:34,219
Oh, drive fast.

939
00:49:34,219 --> 00:49:35,500
Don't be nice about it.

940
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:37,900
This thing's a tin can.

941
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:39,019
Megalol Disney game.

942
00:49:39,659 --> 00:49:41,420
Is that whiskey back there in the truck?

943
00:49:41,420 --> 00:49:42,300
We're on the frame limiter.

944
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:43,019
Yep.

945
00:49:43,019 --> 00:49:44,139
New supplier.

946
00:49:44,139 --> 00:49:46,619
You guys deal in broad daylight.

947
00:49:47,420 --> 00:49:48,969
Normally not.

948
00:49:48,969 --> 00:49:49,449
Is this...

949
00:49:50,010 --> 00:49:51,369
There's no such thing as traffic lights.

950
00:49:51,369 --> 00:49:53,050
Cops know better than to come sniffing around our turf.

951
00:49:53,050 --> 00:49:54,570
How the fuck do people drive?

952
00:49:54,570 --> 00:49:55,760
We're out.

953
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:57,280
The guy who's argy got it.

954
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:57,840
Oh shit.

955
00:49:57,840 --> 00:49:58,719
I'm in the wrong lane.

956
00:49:58,719 --> 00:49:59,840
We have more friends in the forest than us.

957
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:00,400
Arrest this guy.

958
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:01,280
He's beeping at me.

959
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:02,320
We're okay.

960
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:04,159
Be careful.

961
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:06,239
For our shoulder.

962
00:50:06,239 --> 00:50:08,750
Is that the Canadian whiskey that comes through?

963
00:50:08,750 --> 00:50:10,750
Guys, that's...

964
00:50:10,750 --> 00:50:12,590
Dude, the game actually, like, improved.

965
00:50:13,869 --> 00:50:15,070
I turned on the graphics.

966
00:50:15,070 --> 00:50:16,110
I'm no big drinker.

967
00:50:16,670 --> 00:50:18,190
I used a tip-back bathtub.

968
00:50:18,190 --> 00:50:20,670
I didn't just stuffed up a bunch of crumpled pieces of paper

969
00:50:20,670 --> 00:50:22,269
into my CPU bottleneck.

970
00:50:22,269 --> 00:50:24,199
That stuff's no good for you.

971
00:50:24,199 --> 00:50:27,210
You don't have to go boss.

972
00:50:27,210 --> 00:50:28,730
You got a line in the good stuff.

973
00:50:29,739 --> 00:50:30,699
That's good of you.

974
00:50:30,699 --> 00:50:31,199
Thanks.

975
00:50:32,349 --> 00:50:33,070
Not just the booze is fine.

976
00:50:33,070 --> 00:50:33,949
Oh, the 1080's fine.

977
00:50:33,949 --> 00:50:34,510
We're good.

978
00:50:34,510 --> 00:50:36,750
It's the places we deliver to.

979
00:50:36,750 --> 00:50:38,829
The deems they got in these places.

980
00:50:38,829 --> 00:50:39,869
That's tables.

981
00:50:39,869 --> 00:50:40,829
That's food.

982
00:50:40,829 --> 00:50:41,789
That's a skirt.

983
00:50:42,429 --> 00:50:43,230
Some way to live.

984
00:50:44,190 --> 00:50:48,030
Right now, all I wanna do is wreck the day of the bastards who wrecked mine.

985
00:50:48,909 --> 00:50:49,710
Sure.

986
00:50:49,710 --> 00:50:50,590
Sure.

987
00:50:50,590 --> 00:50:51,789
All right, take the limiter off.

988
00:50:51,789 --> 00:50:52,269
No cops.

989
00:50:52,269 --> 00:50:52,670
Let's go.

990
00:50:52,670 --> 00:50:54,030
This could get a guy in trouble.

991
00:50:54,829 --> 00:50:58,909
Trouble says the guy is about to set fire to Morello's parking lot.

992
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:01,500
What?

993
00:51:02,679 --> 00:51:03,239
It'll go fine.

994
00:51:03,239 --> 00:51:04,119
But you don't understand.

995
00:51:04,119 --> 00:51:05,159
Well, if it don't go fine.

996
00:51:05,159 --> 00:51:06,280
He's gonna do that at some point.

997
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:08,039
He's gonna do the hi, Master Shag voice.

998
00:51:08,039 --> 00:51:08,920
And we're gonna all laugh.

999
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:11,000
You hit him so hard, they don't remember it.

1000
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:22,429
I laughed.

1001
00:51:22,429 --> 00:51:23,389
Yeah, I did too.

1002
00:51:23,389 --> 00:51:23,949
We all did.

1003
00:51:24,670 --> 00:51:27,710
If you didn't, you must be immune to fun.

1004
00:51:28,510 --> 00:51:32,619
I'm gonna just lean back in the chair and went, ugh.

1005
00:51:35,710 --> 00:51:36,989
And they tried to click the X,

1006
00:51:36,989 --> 00:51:39,630
but they misclicked twice and opened up a new tab

1007
00:51:39,630 --> 00:51:41,150
and that pissed them off even more.

1008
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:44,119
And they're not coming back to the screen.

1009
00:51:45,929 --> 00:51:46,650
They clicked wrong.

1010
00:51:46,650 --> 00:51:48,809
They like minimize the window or something in a fit of rage

1011
00:51:48,809 --> 00:51:50,329
and they're just like, fuck, I'm not coming back.

1012
00:51:51,289 --> 00:51:54,590
Hey, they'll be back.

1013
00:51:54,590 --> 00:51:55,550
Don't worry.

1014
00:51:55,550 --> 00:51:59,679
Oh, that was illegal.

1015
00:51:59,679 --> 00:52:00,719
No, no, no, right on red.

1016
00:52:00,719 --> 00:52:01,219
That's okay.

1017
00:52:15,019 --> 00:52:15,900
There was a guy there.

1018
00:52:17,099 --> 00:52:17,599
There's a crime.

1019
00:52:19,340 --> 00:52:21,500
In general, we look after little Italy

1020
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:24,539
and his guys work North Park and more besides.

1021
00:52:25,340 --> 00:52:26,940
You're walking on the wrong sidewalk.

1022
00:52:27,659 --> 00:52:29,659
You can't turn right on red in New York City.

1023
00:52:31,659 --> 00:52:32,219
You can't?

1024
00:52:32,219 --> 00:52:33,980
Oh, well, all right.

1025
00:52:33,980 --> 00:52:36,460
They start appearing on street corners to stare you down.

1026
00:52:39,050 --> 00:52:40,409
This is not New York City.

1027
00:52:40,409 --> 00:52:40,909
Oh, okay.

1028
00:52:43,639 --> 00:52:44,599
This is Chicago.

1029
00:52:45,849 --> 00:52:46,409
Right.

1030
00:52:46,409 --> 00:52:47,769
Okay, not New York City.

1031
00:52:48,409 --> 00:52:50,889
Every game where a guy is in the mafia

1032
00:52:50,889 --> 00:52:52,889
does not take place in New York City.

1033
00:52:52,889 --> 00:52:56,090
As much as I apparently, I think that it is.

1034
00:52:56,889 --> 00:53:00,000
It's not Chicago either.

1035
00:53:00,639 --> 00:53:01,360
What is it then?

1036
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:03,070
Where the hell are we?

1037
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:10,059
This is not Boston.

1038
00:53:10,780 --> 00:53:13,980
I know what Boston looks like, guys.

1039
00:53:13,980 --> 00:53:14,699
It doesn't look like this.

1040
00:53:15,579 --> 00:53:17,280
And you might say, what do you do?

1041
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:20,239
No, no, Boston's looked the same since 1930.

1042
00:53:24,539 --> 00:53:25,820
Nothing has changed.

1043
00:53:25,820 --> 00:53:29,369
It's a fictional city.

1044
00:53:29,369 --> 00:53:32,909
All right, follow up.

1045
00:53:37,199 --> 00:53:39,760
Okay, there was like a gravity hole over here.

1046
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:40,880
That I just got pulled into.

1047
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:44,079
All right, press right stick to sneak.

1048
00:53:52,190 --> 00:53:53,389
When do I get to use the bat?

1049
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:03,230
Boston's a fake city.

1050
00:54:04,619 --> 00:54:05,119
Okay.

1051
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:08,460
Open the gate, onto the roof.

1052
00:54:08,460 --> 00:54:08,960
You got it.

1053
00:54:10,780 --> 00:54:12,059
Holy shit, Polly.

1054
00:54:12,059 --> 00:54:13,260
That was fucking crazy.

1055
00:54:13,820 --> 00:54:18,059
Wish we got to get you in the Olympics.

1056
00:54:18,619 --> 00:54:29,179
Oh, I'm Tommy.

1057
00:54:29,179 --> 00:54:29,500
Right.

1058
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:30,139
Okay, whatever.

1059
00:54:30,780 --> 00:54:31,679
All right, I'm up here.

1060
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:42,119
Sneak up up.

1061
00:54:42,119 --> 00:54:45,019
How do I jump down?

1062
00:54:45,820 --> 00:54:48,650
Keep distracting him.

1063
00:55:01,469 --> 00:55:02,190
What does that matter?

1064
00:55:02,750 --> 00:55:07,449
Why does that even matter?

1065
00:55:07,449 --> 00:55:08,090
What do you mean?

1066
00:55:08,090 --> 00:55:08,650
Who cares?

1067
00:55:09,690 --> 00:55:10,570
Oh no, Polly.

1068
00:55:11,130 --> 00:55:12,170
I cut his legs off.

1069
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:18,000
Take it back and start swinging.

1070
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,440
Oh shit, there's a weapon wheel.

1071
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:21,960
Oh my god, there's a hitman feature.

1072
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:23,000
This game is cool.

1073
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:23,639
Hold on.

1074
00:55:23,639 --> 00:55:24,360
What do I do with them?

1075
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:33,469
Okay, use the bat.

1076
00:55:33,469 --> 00:55:35,000
It's a weapon wheel?

1077
00:55:35,900 --> 00:55:37,099
Oh shit.

1078
00:55:37,099 --> 00:55:38,219
It just got fucking real.

1079
00:55:40,219 --> 00:55:41,739
Oh my god, the game just got real.

1080
00:55:41,739 --> 00:55:43,900
This became, might be one of my favorite games of the year.

1081
00:55:44,619 --> 00:55:45,659
Just because I just watched.

1082
00:55:45,659 --> 00:55:46,780
That animation's all I care about.

1083
00:55:51,559 --> 00:55:53,159
This is a crow hop swing.

1084
00:56:01,239 --> 00:56:02,519
Oh, this is going to be great.

1085
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:08,090
Okay, let's go.

1086
00:56:08,730 --> 00:56:10,400
No, no, no, no, no.

1087
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:19,050
Is there a Batman in the head?

1088
00:56:21,150 --> 00:56:21,550
In the head?

1089
00:56:24,989 --> 00:56:26,190
Molotov?

1090
00:56:26,190 --> 00:56:27,150
Oh shit.

1091
00:56:27,150 --> 00:56:28,190
It's right bumper and then you...

1092
00:56:28,989 --> 00:56:30,269
Oh man, this game's fun.

1093
00:56:30,909 --> 00:56:31,710
This game's fun.

1094
00:56:32,510 --> 00:56:38,639
Holy shit.

1095
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:48,320
Okay, you cannot do that to a friend of yours

1096
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:49,840
and have your friend trust you ever again.

1097
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:51,760
Oh man, I was just messing around.

1098
00:56:53,679 --> 00:56:54,400
No, you weren't.

1099
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:56,159
Man, I don't think we can hang out anymore.

1100
00:57:03,230 --> 00:57:04,670
It was intent behind that swing.

1101
00:57:11,340 --> 00:57:11,840
Go.

1102
00:57:16,010 --> 00:57:20,860
Watch out, lady.

1103
00:57:26,650 --> 00:57:28,409
He is in the ignition here.

1104
00:57:30,639 --> 00:57:32,320
Oh wow, this game's really cool.

1105
00:57:33,519 --> 00:57:34,239
Oh, sick jump.

1106
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:37,300
Yeah.

1107
00:57:40,300 --> 00:57:41,019
Are they going to do it?

1108
00:57:41,019 --> 00:57:41,519
No.

1109
00:57:42,380 --> 00:57:46,809
What's a bicycle for?

1110
00:57:46,809 --> 00:57:47,289
Oh no, no, no, no.

1111
00:57:47,289 --> 00:57:49,469
That's handcuffs on the right.

1112
00:57:53,019 --> 00:57:54,780
Stay out of sight till they lose interest.

1113
00:57:55,579 --> 00:57:57,179
What's the handbrake, dude?

1114
00:57:57,179 --> 00:57:58,300
I don't know what the handbrake is.

1115
00:57:59,099 --> 00:58:02,699
Fuck, what's the handbrake?

1116
00:58:02,699 --> 00:58:03,260
Does anybody know?

1117
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:04,460
Is it B?

1118
00:58:05,820 --> 00:58:07,289
It's B, okay.

1119
00:58:08,010 --> 00:58:16,159
Didn't expect me to hit the brakes.

1120
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:19,320
It's not Y.

1121
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:20,440
Y falls out of car.

1122
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:29,949
They're right behind us, dude.

1123
00:58:33,980 --> 00:58:34,480
Hey!

1124
00:58:36,860 --> 00:58:37,579
What are you...

1125
00:58:37,579 --> 00:58:42,139
I feel like I'm playing Mario Kart

1126
00:58:42,139 --> 00:58:45,019
and someone's trying to make me stay in second place.

1127
00:58:45,019 --> 00:58:45,900
Get away from me.

1128
00:58:50,010 --> 00:58:50,809
Bingo.

1129
00:58:50,809 --> 00:58:52,969
It's pretty clean.

1130
00:58:52,969 --> 00:58:53,769
Did he do it clean?

1131
00:58:53,769 --> 00:58:54,269
Nope.

1132
00:58:54,730 --> 00:58:57,960
Press X real quick.

1133
00:58:57,960 --> 00:58:58,920
No, I know what that does.

1134
00:59:01,559 --> 00:59:02,280
Clear.

1135
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:06,969
Okay, stay out of sight till they lose interest.

1136
00:59:07,849 --> 00:59:08,489
All right, are we good?

1137
00:59:09,289 --> 00:59:11,400
There's a car behind us.

1138
00:59:13,340 --> 00:59:14,619
What a joke of a streamer.

1139
00:59:14,619 --> 00:59:18,170
Hey, is that a cop right there?

1140
00:59:19,130 --> 00:59:20,329
What's the blue thing right there?

1141
00:59:20,329 --> 00:59:20,889
Is that a cop?

1142
00:59:22,429 --> 00:59:23,230
Blip on the minimap.

1143
00:59:23,230 --> 00:59:23,630
Blue blip.

1144
00:59:23,630 --> 00:59:24,130
What is that?

1145
00:59:27,420 --> 00:59:28,460
Yes, yeah, okay, okay, okay.

1146
00:59:28,460 --> 00:59:29,500
We lost them.

1147
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:31,639
Stay out of sight till they lose interest.

1148
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:36,880
All right, we're almost out.

1149
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:40,400
I want to run this guy over so bad.

1150
00:59:45,369 --> 00:59:46,010
Okay, I'm good.

1151
00:59:54,170 --> 00:59:56,170
Blue blip is a Dunkin' Donuts location.

1152
00:59:58,489 --> 00:59:59,210
You know what's funny?

1153
01:00:00,090 --> 01:00:03,210
I know for a fact that what you're saying is a joke,

1154
01:00:03,210 --> 01:00:06,969
but there definitely is a Find the Dunkin' Nearest You app.

1155
01:00:09,289 --> 01:00:10,809
Why would you ever want that app?

1156
01:00:10,809 --> 01:00:11,449
What's it for?

1157
01:00:11,449 --> 01:00:12,489
Why would you even need to know that?

1158
01:00:13,530 --> 01:00:16,250
Drive one mile in any direction in New England.

1159
01:00:17,929 --> 01:00:19,289
Why do you need an app to tell you where to go?

1160
01:00:22,090 --> 01:00:22,889
That's like being like,

1161
01:00:23,849 --> 01:00:27,610
can I find a McDonald's anywhere at some point in the next 20 minutes?

1162
01:00:28,170 --> 01:00:29,289
Yes, you can.

1163
01:00:29,289 --> 01:00:33,369
Just drive straight on any road in the world.

1164
01:00:33,369 --> 01:00:34,090
You will find one.

1165
01:00:39,130 --> 01:00:40,329
If you ever feel like going to McDonald's,

1166
01:00:40,329 --> 01:00:41,369
don't even put in your GPS.

1167
01:00:41,369 --> 01:00:41,929
There's no reason to.

1168
01:00:42,809 --> 01:00:43,369
Take a road.

1169
01:00:44,809 --> 01:00:45,289
You'll find it.

1170
01:00:52,409 --> 01:00:53,210
Is he brainless?

1171
01:00:56,329 --> 01:00:56,889
Brain limiter.

1172
01:00:57,530 --> 01:00:58,570
And he's an old bastard.

1173
01:00:58,570 --> 01:01:00,730
I care, but we don't need the attention.

1174
01:01:01,769 --> 01:01:06,639
And one day I found myself in the yard behind a bar drawing with Vincenzo.

1175
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:09,840
10 years go by and I'm still there.

1176
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:11,280
That says a lot about society.

1177
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:13,440
I got a suit now and Vinny's an old bastard.

1178
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:17,119
I always thought that to be in a family you had to have more

1179
01:01:18,159 --> 01:01:18,960
connections.

1180
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:20,079
Fuckin' society.

1181
01:01:20,079 --> 01:01:21,760
Or your uncle.

1182
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:23,119
Oh, some guys.

1183
01:01:23,119 --> 01:01:24,079
Sure.

1184
01:01:24,079 --> 01:01:26,400
Your cousin got made or you like Carlos.

1185
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:28,000
Pop went way back with the Don.

1186
01:01:28,639 --> 01:01:31,039
That means you get trusted more when you're starting out.

1187
01:01:31,599 --> 01:01:34,719
There's plenty of us who keep me in on the street.

1188
01:01:34,719 --> 01:01:36,800
I'm thinking we get here in front of the boss.

1189
01:01:37,519 --> 01:01:38,559
Then we tip a few.

1190
01:01:39,519 --> 01:01:41,119
Well, I don't got plans.

1191
01:01:41,119 --> 01:01:42,880
So what's the green eye?

1192
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:45,199
There's a green eye right here.

1193
01:01:45,199 --> 01:01:47,280
Vinny so much booze that Luigi.

1194
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:48,000
What's that for?

1195
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:48,800
Green eye.

1196
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:50,800
I'm good with whatever.

1197
01:01:51,599 --> 01:01:52,880
Sure you are.

1198
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:57,369
Can you do like peel outs in 1930?

1199
01:02:00,119 --> 01:02:02,280
No, the engine ran on like fucking humidity.

1200
01:02:04,730 --> 01:02:05,610
You can't.

1201
01:02:05,610 --> 01:02:11,869
We get it.

1202
01:02:11,869 --> 01:02:14,170
What happened to the Christ sent you out with?

1203
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:23,760
Why?

1204
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:24,400
Yes.

1205
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:26,320
Ray never killed nobody.

1206
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:27,519
Why is the tire fire?

1207
01:02:29,079 --> 01:02:30,360
Wait, one of the tires is on fire?

1208
01:02:34,269 --> 01:02:35,309
Baseball bat him.

1209
01:02:36,429 --> 01:02:36,989
You can't.

1210
01:02:36,989 --> 01:02:38,989
You can't baseball bat your friends.

1211
01:02:38,989 --> 01:02:41,630
That's not going to work in this game.

1212
01:02:41,630 --> 01:02:51,389
Hey, fellas.

1213
01:02:51,389 --> 01:02:52,349
You get to play pool?

1214
01:02:52,349 --> 01:02:53,789
Because I'll never play it because I hate pool.

1215
01:02:53,789 --> 01:02:54,349
I think it sucks.

1216
01:02:54,349 --> 01:02:55,070
It's a dumb sport.

1217
01:02:57,880 --> 01:02:59,880
I was really vicious for no reason.

1218
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:03,559
I'm just kidding.

1219
01:03:03,559 --> 01:03:04,440
I like pool.

1220
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:05,320
I play it.

1221
01:03:05,320 --> 01:03:07,480
I play it like I played it like two weeks ago.

1222
01:03:09,210 --> 01:03:10,090
Come on, guys.

1223
01:03:10,809 --> 01:03:13,130
He's not going to be able to think straight for weeks.

1224
01:03:15,119 --> 01:03:18,360
See, that's the difference between me and Meroa.

1225
01:03:19,159 --> 01:03:20,440
I'm a businessman.

1226
01:03:20,440 --> 01:03:21,559
I do everything with this.

1227
01:03:22,199 --> 01:03:23,659
I just want to start eating cigarette.

1228
01:03:23,659 --> 01:03:24,139
I make?

1229
01:03:24,699 --> 01:03:26,760
It's what's good for the business.

1230
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:31,050
Boys, a Merela is a hothead.

1231
01:03:31,050 --> 01:03:34,750
And all that anger burns out the brain.

1232
01:03:34,750 --> 01:03:38,090
And when he gets mad, he gets stupid.

1233
01:03:38,090 --> 01:03:40,809
You got nothing like that to worry about with Tommy here.

1234
01:03:40,809 --> 01:03:42,409
He was aces the whole way, boss.

1235
01:03:43,130 --> 01:03:44,090
I'm glad to hear it.

1236
01:03:44,730 --> 01:03:46,590
I got a growing business here.

1237
01:03:47,639 --> 01:03:49,800
We could use a guy like you to help out around the bar.

1238
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:50,440
I'm scared of you.

1239
01:03:50,440 --> 01:03:52,039
Maybe run some errands.

1240
01:03:52,039 --> 01:03:53,960
Make sure the bills get paid on time.

1241
01:03:53,960 --> 01:03:54,519
You up for that?

1242
01:03:55,639 --> 01:03:57,079
It'd be an honor, sir.

1243
01:04:02,239 --> 01:04:03,119
What do you think the room would do?

1244
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:06,800
But you need to understand we have a few rules around here,

1245
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:08,000
so you listen and listen good.

1246
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:11,440
First, no cursing on the premises.

1247
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:13,360
There's a million words out there.

1248
01:04:13,360 --> 01:04:16,320
The man who needs to resort to fuck this and fuck that

1249
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:17,920
is just ignorant or lazy.

1250
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:21,119
Second, we don't deal in the hard stuff.

1251
01:04:21,119 --> 01:04:23,440
I don't want any dolphins in this neighborhood.

1252
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:25,199
We'll let Merela poison his own people.

1253
01:04:25,199 --> 01:04:26,880
What would happen if I said, yeah, that's great.

1254
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:29,599
Can you lean forward a little bit and say that into my chest?

1255
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:32,519
A little bit clearer and loud this time.

1256
01:04:32,519 --> 01:04:35,230
You cross the line.

1257
01:04:35,230 --> 01:04:36,670
The rest will come after you.

1258
01:04:36,670 --> 01:04:37,309
You understand?

1259
01:04:37,869 --> 01:04:39,610
Yes, Mr. Celieri.

1260
01:04:39,610 --> 01:04:46,000
Then I'm going to only ask you for one more thing, Tommy.

1261
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:47,199
I didn't even have a wire on.

1262
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:50,639
It's a bad prank to pull on the Don.

1263
01:04:50,639 --> 01:04:53,340
A lot of guys out there are bigger and tougher than these two.

1264
01:04:53,340 --> 01:04:56,860
And I don't keep Frank on a payroll because he's smart.

1265
01:04:56,860 --> 01:04:59,320
Though he is an artist with the numbers.

1266
01:05:01,199 --> 01:05:06,909
All these guys in this room, they're here because they have

1267
01:05:06,909 --> 01:05:08,750
the only thing that matters to me.

1268
01:05:09,710 --> 01:05:12,349
The only thing that should matter to any of us.

1269
01:05:13,070 --> 01:05:13,869
Your dog.

1270
01:05:13,869 --> 01:05:15,150
You know what that is, Tommy?

1271
01:05:15,150 --> 01:05:15,630
My dog.

1272
01:05:17,289 --> 01:05:17,769
Your dog.

1273
01:05:18,409 --> 01:05:19,289
His dog.

1274
01:05:19,289 --> 01:05:20,489
Somebody's dog in this room.

1275
01:05:22,860 --> 01:05:23,360
Money.

1276
01:05:23,980 --> 01:05:26,489
That's right.

1277
01:05:26,489 --> 01:05:28,860
Now, you stay straight with me.

1278
01:05:28,860 --> 01:05:30,639
You're going to be living the high life, Tom.

1279
01:05:30,639 --> 01:05:33,519
You abuse my trust.

1280
01:05:35,199 --> 01:05:38,400
Don Celieri, you won't ever need to worry about me.

1281
01:05:41,289 --> 01:05:43,050
Until halfway through the game.

1282
01:05:44,219 --> 01:05:47,260
When you double cross me and then I get angry and we fight

1283
01:05:47,260 --> 01:05:49,260
and I end up shooting you third person mode.

1284
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:53,039
Or a grenade.

1285
01:05:53,039 --> 01:05:55,440
Eating one of those is going to work probably in the next two or three hours.

1286
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:56,480
Now I'm starving.

1287
01:05:56,480 --> 01:06:00,000
Luigi, let's eat.

1288
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:07,710
Is that guy going to ask me for the Everlasting Gobstopper recipe?

1289
01:06:07,710 --> 01:06:11,239
Not much for Cook, but his daughter, Sarah.

1290
01:06:11,239 --> 01:06:17,869
What was that guy's name in Willy Wonka?

1291
01:06:17,869 --> 01:06:18,829
Squidward or something?

1292
01:06:18,829 --> 01:06:19,710
It was something like that.

1293
01:06:20,349 --> 01:06:21,710
Oh, that's my associate.

1294
01:06:21,710 --> 01:06:22,429
Squidward.

1295
01:06:22,429 --> 01:06:22,829
What is it?

1296
01:06:22,829 --> 01:06:23,630
What was his name?

1297
01:06:23,630 --> 01:06:26,719
It's something like Slugworth.

1298
01:06:26,719 --> 01:06:27,760
Yeah, that's Slugworth.

1299
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:31,929
The guy eats and delivers messages.

1300
01:06:32,010 --> 01:06:35,449
The guy's busted balls and told stories from the old country.

1301
01:06:36,250 --> 01:06:37,769
Mostly we just waited.

1302
01:06:37,769 --> 01:06:39,130
I got to thinking.

1303
01:06:39,130 --> 01:06:42,010
Maybe life in Celieri's crew wasn't going to get me clipped.

1304
01:06:44,329 --> 01:06:45,130
What did I know?

1305
01:06:45,130 --> 01:06:45,849
Fight practice?

1306
01:06:46,570 --> 01:06:48,090
Ooh, that was a good move.

1307
01:06:48,090 --> 01:06:48,590
Yeah.

1308
01:06:50,760 --> 01:06:51,260
Thanks.

1309
01:06:53,960 --> 01:06:56,840
Wait, is it the...

1310
01:06:56,840 --> 01:06:57,639
Can I play too?

1311
01:06:59,130 --> 01:07:00,090
All right, guys, that's enough.

1312
01:07:00,090 --> 01:07:00,590
Settle down.

1313
01:07:02,909 --> 01:07:03,869
Wow, they actually listened.

1314
01:07:06,590 --> 01:07:08,110
Holy shit, the whole place cleared out.

1315
01:07:08,670 --> 01:07:11,019
I have power here.

1316
01:07:12,239 --> 01:07:12,960
Holy shit.

1317
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:13,460
All right.

1318
01:07:18,329 --> 01:07:19,050
Anybody in here?

1319
01:07:19,050 --> 01:07:22,989
All right, I gotta go back into the room.

1320
01:07:22,989 --> 01:07:25,159
There he is.

1321
01:07:25,159 --> 01:07:26,280
Sorry I'm late.

1322
01:07:26,280 --> 01:07:27,320
Take a seat.

1323
01:07:27,320 --> 01:07:28,039
It's a fun game.

1324
01:07:29,739 --> 01:07:30,539
I like that game.

1325
01:07:33,519 --> 01:07:34,320
Aren't we just in here?

1326
01:07:34,320 --> 01:07:35,920
That's collection day, boys.

1327
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:37,719
Tommy, you'll drive?

1328
01:07:37,719 --> 01:07:39,159
Bully and Sam can handle the rest.

1329
01:07:39,159 --> 01:07:41,050
It'll be routine.

1330
01:07:41,050 --> 01:07:43,050
Just a handful of stops today.

1331
01:07:43,050 --> 01:07:45,369
Bill at the motel was a little short last month.

1332
01:07:45,369 --> 01:07:47,659
We'll make sure he pays us the interest he owes.

1333
01:07:47,659 --> 01:07:48,940
No problem, boss.

1334
01:07:48,940 --> 01:07:51,420
Don't lay hands on anyone unless there's no other choice.

1335
01:07:52,380 --> 01:07:55,739
Our clients need to understand that we provide a valuable service.

1336
01:07:56,460 --> 01:07:59,420
They need to look at you and see Santa Michael.

1337
01:07:59,420 --> 01:08:01,449
They need to believe you'll protect them.

1338
01:08:02,250 --> 01:08:03,369
So let Morello stoop to bring them in.

1339
01:08:03,369 --> 01:08:04,090
Need to believe?

1340
01:08:04,650 --> 01:08:05,530
We're better than that.

1341
01:08:05,530 --> 01:08:07,159
The bills still do?

1342
01:08:07,159 --> 01:08:08,119
Wait, this is illegal?

1343
01:08:08,119 --> 01:08:09,079
Everyone pays up.

1344
01:08:09,079 --> 01:08:12,119
We can handle it.

1345
01:08:12,119 --> 01:08:12,619
Um.

1346
01:08:12,619 --> 01:08:13,559
Go see Ralphie about a car.

1347
01:08:14,119 --> 01:08:14,920
Okay, boss.

1348
01:08:14,920 --> 01:08:15,420
Yeah.

1349
01:08:15,960 --> 01:08:16,600
Yes, very.

1350
01:08:17,239 --> 01:08:21,930
For a second I thought he was smoking the cigar backwards.

1351
01:08:22,970 --> 01:08:24,760
Like, holy shit.

1352
01:08:24,760 --> 01:08:26,199
What a Chad move.

1353
01:08:26,199 --> 01:08:30,680
Probably just wants to tell you some bullshit story about some guy he whacked 20 years ago.

1354
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:38,560
I kind of like this outfit.

1355
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:39,520
I feel like I would wear this.

1356
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:40,319
Nah, lose the tie.

1357
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:42,239
Lose the tie, lose the hat.

1358
01:08:42,239 --> 01:08:43,439
Zip it down a little bit more.

1359
01:08:43,439 --> 01:08:44,319
Like another four inches.

1360
01:08:57,149 --> 01:08:57,649
All right.

1361
01:08:58,590 --> 01:08:59,090
Hey.

1362
01:09:01,399 --> 01:09:02,119
What'd you see?

1363
01:09:02,119 --> 01:09:02,619
Something new?

1364
01:09:06,829 --> 01:09:07,630
Wait, what do you mean?

1365
01:09:07,630 --> 01:09:09,550
You see like this little shitty gun you thought of me?

1366
01:09:10,109 --> 01:09:12,670
You didn't see like a rifle or a bazooka and think of me?

1367
01:09:12,670 --> 01:09:13,470
What's that supposed to mean?

1368
01:09:13,470 --> 01:09:14,109
You think that's funny?

1369
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:16,359
What am I funny to you?

1370
01:09:16,359 --> 01:09:17,079
You think that's a joke?

1371
01:09:17,960 --> 01:09:18,680
Fucking little gun?

1372
01:09:27,279 --> 01:09:28,079
Funny like a clown?

1373
01:09:28,079 --> 01:09:28,579
Funny?

1374
01:09:29,039 --> 01:09:29,539
Funny how?

1375
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:33,800
What an incredible scene.

1376
01:09:36,319 --> 01:09:37,680
Oh shit, I just tried to shoot him.

1377
01:09:37,680 --> 01:09:38,560
Do you think he would hear that?

1378
01:09:42,010 --> 01:09:48,380
There's no bullets in here, dude.

1379
01:09:51,229 --> 01:09:51,729
Oh, okay.

1380
01:09:53,390 --> 01:09:54,189
He can see it.

1381
01:09:55,069 --> 01:09:56,189
He can see it.

1382
01:09:56,829 --> 01:09:59,020
How do you reload?

1383
01:09:59,020 --> 01:09:59,520
Oh.

1384
01:10:01,229 --> 01:10:02,189
All right, X is reload.

1385
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:11,380
Oh.

1386
01:10:15,439 --> 01:10:16,720
And don't shoot yourself.

1387
01:10:16,720 --> 01:10:17,520
Thanks, Vincenzo.

1388
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:18,479
Don't shoot yourself.

1389
01:10:18,479 --> 01:10:18,979
I got it.

1390
01:10:27,630 --> 01:10:28,130
Thanks.

1391
01:10:28,430 --> 01:10:29,069
All right, Ralph.

1392
01:10:29,069 --> 01:10:29,630
I'm ready.

1393
01:10:29,630 --> 01:10:30,350
I get my gun.

1394
01:10:31,149 --> 01:10:32,109
I know how to reload.

1395
01:10:32,750 --> 01:10:36,199
You guys are in the way.

1396
01:10:36,199 --> 01:10:36,699
No, you're not.

1397
01:10:37,159 --> 01:10:39,180
Do a diaper check.

1398
01:10:42,810 --> 01:10:43,529
All right, Ralph.

1399
01:10:44,670 --> 01:10:45,630
Do we all have guns?

1400
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:51,119
One year since the crash.

1401
01:10:52,270 --> 01:10:52,750
The worst?

1402
01:10:52,750 --> 01:10:54,109
Yeah, Wall Street crash.

1403
01:10:54,109 --> 01:10:54,609
Right.

1404
01:10:58,170 --> 01:10:58,670
Beyond Meat.

1405
01:11:05,039 --> 01:11:05,539
Easy.

1406
01:11:18,109 --> 01:11:19,390
That was really easy.

1407
01:11:19,390 --> 01:11:20,989
You're a regular magician, Ralphie.

1408
01:11:22,189 --> 01:11:22,989
Oh shit, that's right.

1409
01:11:22,989 --> 01:11:25,310
These are when the doors were made out of, like, clay.

1410
01:11:25,869 --> 01:11:26,930
I forgot.

1411
01:11:28,350 --> 01:11:32,109
Opening a car door was as simple as just pulling it a little harder than normal.

1412
01:11:32,109 --> 01:11:44,729
These things don't even turn on, man.

1413
01:11:45,449 --> 01:11:48,010
This is a lemon.

1414
01:11:55,819 --> 01:11:57,420
Al's late again?

1415
01:11:57,420 --> 01:11:58,140
Seems so.

1416
01:11:59,020 --> 01:11:59,819
That's too bad.

1417
01:12:01,289 --> 01:12:02,649
What happened to him?

1418
01:12:03,289 --> 01:12:04,729
What happened to him?

1419
01:12:04,729 --> 01:12:05,289
Is he okay?

1420
01:12:07,869 --> 01:12:09,760
Drive safe, Tom.

1421
01:12:10,649 --> 01:12:11,850
Holly's real belly.

1422
01:12:14,699 --> 01:12:15,579
He's alive still.

1423
01:12:16,300 --> 01:12:19,289
Stop it.

1424
01:12:19,289 --> 01:12:19,930
He's all right.

1425
01:12:19,930 --> 01:12:20,489
He's fine.

1426
01:12:23,579 --> 01:12:24,460
Drive to the collection.

1427
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:27,319
Oh, now that's what we're talking about.

1428
01:12:27,319 --> 01:12:32,279
I can't snap my fingers and drive the car.

1429
01:12:36,119 --> 01:12:39,000
By the way, can I tell you what my favorite game, Billiards?

1430
01:12:40,039 --> 01:12:41,000
It's one of the best.

1431
01:12:41,640 --> 01:12:44,920
I like to go just, like, to the bar and play a round or two with the friends.

1432
01:12:45,560 --> 01:12:57,680
Is he drunk?

1433
01:12:59,079 --> 01:12:59,880
At what?

1434
01:12:59,880 --> 01:13:04,119
Are you asking me if I'm drunk at 1 15 in the afternoon on a Tuesday?

1435
01:13:06,380 --> 01:13:06,880
Yes.

1436
01:13:07,260 --> 01:13:20,239
Turn up the volume.

1437
01:13:20,960 --> 01:13:23,880
Set a reasonable volume.

1438
01:13:23,880 --> 01:13:27,229
All right, we have to collect money, so don't hurt them, right?

1439
01:13:27,229 --> 01:13:31,920
Just drive up here and be like, give me the money.

1440
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:36,239
And aim the gun at him, but don't shoot.

1441
01:13:37,640 --> 01:13:38,279
Got it.

1442
01:13:38,279 --> 01:13:39,090
Easy.

1443
01:13:45,310 --> 01:13:46,029
Hey, Tom.

1444
01:13:46,029 --> 01:13:48,199
When it goes smooth, it's a breeze.

1445
01:13:48,199 --> 01:13:51,880
When they put up a fight, sometimes you gotta think on your feet.

1446
01:13:51,880 --> 01:13:52,279
Sure.

1447
01:13:52,279 --> 01:13:53,720
Just follow my lead.

1448
01:13:53,720 --> 01:13:58,569
Oh, did you guys hear Otto sneeze?

1449
01:13:59,449 --> 01:14:02,170
He just went...

1450
01:14:05,800 --> 01:14:07,680
Okay, done.

1451
01:14:12,350 --> 01:14:13,069
We're good.

1452
01:14:13,069 --> 01:14:14,029
How's little Julia?

1453
01:14:14,029 --> 01:14:14,670
How's the money?

1454
01:14:15,229 --> 01:14:16,350
I mean, how's the restaurant?

1455
01:14:18,029 --> 01:14:22,989
This letter is a notification that you are in default of your obligation

1456
01:14:22,989 --> 01:14:25,340
to make payments on your agreed loan.

1457
01:14:25,340 --> 01:14:28,619
This amount has been overdue since July 15, 1930.

1458
01:14:28,619 --> 01:14:30,300
You've ignored requests to pay this debt,

1459
01:14:30,300 --> 01:14:32,380
unless the full amount is received, within two weeks,

1460
01:14:32,380 --> 01:14:33,819
I will have no choice but to instruct this bank

1461
01:14:33,819 --> 01:14:36,300
to begin the foreclosure process of your home and business.

1462
01:14:36,300 --> 01:14:37,260
That's us.

1463
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:47,600
So we have to do, like, protection?

1464
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:48,960
We have to rough the place up?

1465
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:50,000
Should I just eat a bunch of bread?

1466
01:14:56,960 --> 01:14:58,560
Stop picking up loaves and taking bites?

1467
01:15:03,319 --> 01:15:05,640
All right, let's give him one another month.

1468
01:15:09,949 --> 01:15:11,229
I think he deserves another month.

1469
01:15:16,079 --> 01:15:16,640
Double or nothing.

1470
01:15:17,439 --> 01:15:19,039
If he doesn't have the money in three months,

1471
01:15:21,689 --> 01:15:23,770
then we come back and we, I don't know,

1472
01:15:23,770 --> 01:15:34,079
we, like, take his sneakers and we sell them.

1473
01:15:34,079 --> 01:15:34,960
There's drugs back here.

1474
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:36,079
I don't feel bad anymore.

1475
01:15:36,079 --> 01:15:41,369
Dude, he's got a Sam Trappini card?

1476
01:15:41,369 --> 01:15:41,850
This is gonna...

1477
01:15:41,850 --> 01:15:43,529
This is, like, worth, like, five grand.

1478
01:15:43,529 --> 01:15:47,850
What's he saying?

1479
01:15:50,319 --> 01:15:51,680
Able brown envelope.

1480
01:15:51,680 --> 01:16:01,149
That's not...

1481
01:16:01,149 --> 01:16:01,869
Oh, I would...

1482
01:16:01,869 --> 01:16:05,229
I probably wouldn't be doing that if I were you.

1483
01:16:05,229 --> 01:16:10,170
Lady, you're lucky that this is a fucking World of Warcraft sanctuary.

1484
01:16:10,170 --> 01:16:16,600
Otherwise, a chair is flying across the room.

1485
01:16:16,600 --> 01:16:17,079
I got it.

1486
01:16:17,079 --> 01:16:21,789
You need anything, anything at all.

1487
01:16:21,789 --> 01:16:23,130
Show the wheels, Sam.

1488
01:16:23,130 --> 01:16:24,170
Daily WoW reference.

1489
01:16:24,170 --> 01:16:24,810
Yeah, that's the one.

1490
01:16:31,289 --> 01:16:37,710
That old lady has more power than the Dawn.

1491
01:16:37,710 --> 01:16:38,750
Somebody's gonna fight back.

1492
01:16:39,720 --> 01:16:41,159
And then I'm gonna have to take out the bat

1493
01:16:41,800 --> 01:16:43,000
and start swinging, right?

1494
01:16:43,720 --> 01:16:44,600
That's how this is gonna work.

1495
01:16:56,039 --> 01:16:56,439
No, don't...

1496
01:16:56,439 --> 01:16:57,159
What's the point of that?

1497
01:16:57,800 --> 01:16:58,840
That doesn't do anything for me.

1498
01:16:59,560 --> 01:17:01,630
That was just gonna be violence.

1499
01:17:02,270 --> 01:17:03,149
Just for violence.

1500
01:17:03,149 --> 01:17:04,270
Like, no, I'm not doing that.

1501
01:17:04,270 --> 01:17:04,989
We're just gonna drive.

1502
01:17:08,140 --> 01:17:09,579
Well, that's what we called him.

1503
01:17:09,579 --> 01:17:12,300
Probably slammed his head into the counter back in...

1504
01:17:13,180 --> 01:17:14,300
27, I think.

1505
01:17:16,060 --> 01:17:17,819
Yeah, it was hilarious.

1506
01:17:17,819 --> 01:17:20,220
After that, no problems at all.

1507
01:17:20,220 --> 01:17:21,979
If you look, you can still see the blood.

1508
01:17:22,539 --> 01:17:24,619
Poor old bastard couldn't scrub it out.

1509
01:17:25,739 --> 01:17:25,899
Is it...

1510
01:17:25,899 --> 01:17:26,460
Can I go?

1511
01:17:27,420 --> 01:17:29,260
I don't know the rules of the road.

1512
01:17:29,260 --> 01:17:31,340
I don't know the right-of-way tears.

1513
01:17:32,779 --> 01:17:33,180
Slow down.

1514
01:17:33,180 --> 01:17:34,060
I'm going over the speed limit.

1515
01:17:34,060 --> 01:17:35,659
But we don't know Eugene's nephew,

1516
01:17:35,659 --> 01:17:37,420
so he might need reminded, too.

1517
01:17:43,689 --> 01:17:44,569
People just go.

1518
01:17:45,369 --> 01:17:47,680
It's not even four-way stop signs.

1519
01:17:47,680 --> 01:17:49,920
It's just drive across four lanes.

1520
01:17:50,720 --> 01:17:51,439
This is bad.

1521
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:01,279
Welcome to the 1920s, yeah.

1522
01:18:01,840 --> 01:18:08,409
I'm not going over the speed limit, right?

1523
01:18:11,560 --> 01:18:12,279
Don't break any laws.

1524
01:18:12,279 --> 01:18:13,000
There's a cop right here.

1525
01:18:13,560 --> 01:18:14,590
That guy's a cop.

1526
01:18:17,739 --> 01:18:18,560
No.

1527
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:19,520
That car is a cop.

1528
01:18:20,159 --> 01:18:21,630
Something over there is a cop.

1529
01:18:28,409 --> 01:18:28,810
Go ahead.

1530
01:18:28,810 --> 01:18:29,609
Go, go, go, go ahead.

1531
01:18:29,609 --> 01:18:29,770
Go.

1532
01:18:29,770 --> 01:18:30,170
Get ahead.

1533
01:18:30,810 --> 01:18:34,000
Get ahead.

1534
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:34,479
Move.

1535
01:18:34,479 --> 01:18:36,920
Oh, there's a guy in the way.

1536
01:18:37,560 --> 01:18:40,199
If there's a pedestrian in a crosswalk

1537
01:18:40,199 --> 01:18:41,399
and you're waiting for the pedestrian

1538
01:18:41,399 --> 01:18:42,119
you get beeped at,

1539
01:18:42,840 --> 01:18:44,279
that person deserves a middle finger.

1540
01:18:44,840 --> 01:18:58,300
I was backing out of a spot.

1541
01:18:59,180 --> 01:19:01,500
Okay, so this is the story

1542
01:19:01,500 --> 01:19:02,859
that I think about sometimes.

1543
01:19:03,500 --> 01:19:04,539
I was backing out of a spot

1544
01:19:06,060 --> 01:19:07,260
in a parking lot one time,

1545
01:19:07,979 --> 01:19:09,340
and there was this lady

1546
01:19:09,340 --> 01:19:11,260
who was parked perpendicularly

1547
01:19:11,260 --> 01:19:12,140
right behind me.

1548
01:19:12,140 --> 01:19:12,939
She was stopped.

1549
01:19:12,939 --> 01:19:13,420
She wasn't parked,

1550
01:19:13,420 --> 01:19:15,180
but she was pulled up in the parking lot.

1551
01:19:15,180 --> 01:19:16,539
I think she was waiting for somebody or something,

1552
01:19:16,539 --> 01:19:18,140
but she was right in the way

1553
01:19:18,140 --> 01:19:19,180
of where I was trying to back up.

1554
01:19:19,180 --> 01:19:20,539
She was right just blocking me,

1555
01:19:21,500 --> 01:19:22,380
and she didn't move.

1556
01:19:23,420 --> 01:19:24,539
This lady did not move.

1557
01:19:24,539 --> 01:19:26,140
It was like I had to finagle

1558
01:19:26,140 --> 01:19:27,659
so much around her car,

1559
01:19:28,380 --> 01:19:29,979
and she kept on closing her door,

1560
01:19:29,979 --> 01:19:30,300
and she's like,

1561
01:19:30,300 --> 01:19:31,100
no, back up, back up.

1562
01:19:31,100 --> 01:19:31,579
Yeah, you're good.

1563
01:19:31,579 --> 01:19:32,060
You're good.

1564
01:19:32,060 --> 01:19:33,180
And she's like, okay, what the fuck?

1565
01:19:33,180 --> 01:19:34,220
I did my good.

1566
01:19:34,220 --> 01:19:34,939
I'm out.

1567
01:19:34,939 --> 01:19:35,739
And right at the very end,

1568
01:19:35,739 --> 01:19:36,380
I didn't say anything.

1569
01:19:36,380 --> 01:19:37,180
He's doing the story.

1570
01:19:37,180 --> 01:19:37,979
Right at the very end,

1571
01:19:37,979 --> 01:19:38,539
when I finally,

1572
01:19:38,539 --> 01:19:40,300
after a full minute of doing

1573
01:19:40,300 --> 01:19:41,180
an eight-point turn

1574
01:19:41,180 --> 01:19:42,140
to get around this lady,

1575
01:19:42,699 --> 01:19:44,220
I put my thumb out the window

1576
01:19:44,220 --> 01:19:46,220
and gave up a thumbs up real quick,

1577
01:19:46,220 --> 01:19:46,859
and I think she thought

1578
01:19:46,859 --> 01:19:48,140
I gave her the finger.

1579
01:19:48,140 --> 01:19:49,949
I was like, yep, yep, I'm good,

1580
01:19:49,949 --> 01:19:51,069
but I think she saw the finger

1581
01:19:51,069 --> 01:19:51,630
and was just like,

1582
01:19:51,630 --> 01:19:52,109
fuck you.

1583
01:19:58,939 --> 01:19:59,739
But it was a thumbs up.

1584
01:19:59,739 --> 01:20:00,699
It was like, I'm good, yeah.

1585
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:04,729
Did we get out of the car?

1586
01:20:07,529 --> 01:20:08,090
That was a sign.

1587
01:20:08,090 --> 01:20:09,050
That happened in Seinfeld.

1588
01:20:10,489 --> 01:20:14,279
Wait, that happened in Seinfeld?

1589
01:20:17,850 --> 01:20:18,970
I'm not lying.

1590
01:20:18,970 --> 01:20:20,649
I didn't watch an episode of Seinfeld

1591
01:20:20,649 --> 01:20:21,930
and then pulled it out of my memory.

1592
01:20:22,489 --> 01:20:24,890
I gave the thumbs up to somebody.

1593
01:20:24,890 --> 01:20:25,529
Here he comes.

1594
01:20:26,170 --> 01:20:27,529
That's not a fake story.

1595
01:20:32,439 --> 01:20:33,720
I swear to God that happened.

1596
01:20:36,119 --> 01:20:38,119
It happened in Seinfeld.

1597
01:20:39,159 --> 01:20:40,199
Dude, this dude just watched

1598
01:20:40,199 --> 01:20:41,319
an episode of Seinfeld

1599
01:20:42,119 --> 01:20:44,039
and then somehow made it

1600
01:20:44,039 --> 01:20:45,079
a part of his life.

1601
01:20:46,119 --> 01:20:48,680
No, this happened three weeks ago.

1602
01:20:48,680 --> 01:20:49,880
It was not that long ago.

1603
01:20:56,189 --> 01:20:57,390
Holy shit, that guy just

1604
01:20:57,390 --> 01:20:58,510
monster trucked that dude.

1605
01:21:08,279 --> 01:21:09,399
Kind of not hot.

1606
01:21:09,399 --> 01:21:09,880
I don't know.

1607
01:21:11,399 --> 01:21:12,199
Stealing jokes.

1608
01:21:13,640 --> 01:21:14,680
Is it stealing jokes

1609
01:21:14,680 --> 01:21:16,439
if it happened to you in real life?

1610
01:21:16,439 --> 01:21:18,600
We've been working these streets for years.

1611
01:21:18,600 --> 01:21:20,840
You come in and you think you know it all.

1612
01:21:20,840 --> 01:21:22,199
I'm not saying that, Sam.

1613
01:21:22,199 --> 01:21:24,359
I mean, you've been a day on the job, pal.

1614
01:21:24,359 --> 01:21:25,880
You haven't seen what we do.

1615
01:21:25,880 --> 01:21:27,239
You haven't seen how we do it.

1616
01:21:27,239 --> 01:21:28,199
I swear to God.

1617
01:21:29,079 --> 01:21:30,119
No, Polly.

1618
01:21:30,119 --> 01:21:31,640
This punk thinks he can walk in.

1619
01:21:31,640 --> 01:21:32,920
Why did I think that was a good idea?

1620
01:21:32,920 --> 01:21:34,439
Hey, Ralphie, I said.

1621
01:21:34,439 --> 01:21:36,119
Tom sure can drive.

1622
01:21:36,119 --> 01:21:37,800
No working after hours.

1623
01:21:37,800 --> 01:21:38,520
We OK?

1624
01:21:38,520 --> 01:21:39,479
After me and Sam.

1625
01:21:41,079 --> 01:21:42,520
No chance of that.

1626
01:21:42,520 --> 01:21:43,720
I thought it was grass.

1627
01:21:43,720 --> 01:21:44,600
I thought it was grass.

1628
01:21:44,600 --> 01:21:46,039
I just got like loony tune.

1629
01:21:46,039 --> 01:21:46,760
No, Polly.

1630
01:21:46,760 --> 01:21:48,520
This punk thinks he can walk in here.

1631
01:21:48,520 --> 01:21:49,399
You hid.

1632
01:21:49,399 --> 01:21:50,279
You knew I was going to try

1633
01:21:50,279 --> 01:21:51,479
to go through the cut through the grass.

1634
01:21:52,039 --> 01:21:53,800
And you put a bunch of rocks in them.

1635
01:21:53,800 --> 01:21:54,279
Sorry.

1636
01:21:54,279 --> 01:21:56,329
I'd say sorry.

1637
01:21:56,329 --> 01:21:58,090
If I couldn't see the bullshit smile

1638
01:21:58,090 --> 01:21:59,050
you're trying to hide.

1639
01:21:59,850 --> 01:22:07,520
I could smell the crap in your pants from here.

1640
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:08,720
No, you didn't get me.

1641
01:22:10,399 --> 01:22:12,399
When little Pony first came out with us,

1642
01:22:12,399 --> 01:22:14,079
I had him on his knees before he knew.

1643
01:22:14,079 --> 01:22:15,279
This is beautiful.

1644
01:22:15,279 --> 01:22:16,399
This beautiful countryside.

1645
01:22:16,399 --> 01:22:17,199
Where are we supposed to be?

1646
01:22:19,680 --> 01:22:20,720
I want to visit this place.

1647
01:22:25,289 --> 01:22:26,090
New York.

1648
01:22:26,090 --> 01:22:26,810
New York City.

1649
01:22:26,810 --> 01:22:28,569
I hate it out of the city.

1650
01:22:28,569 --> 01:22:30,409
You hate it most places.

1651
01:22:30,409 --> 01:22:32,250
Yeah, but out here it's worse.

1652
01:22:32,250 --> 01:22:34,970
How come there's a place so far out of town on our books?

1653
01:22:34,970 --> 01:22:37,050
Out of town's the safest place for deals.

1654
01:22:37,689 --> 01:22:39,130
Safest place for card games.

1655
01:22:39,689 --> 01:22:42,170
The safest place for most of the things we do.

1656
01:22:42,170 --> 01:22:42,810
Card games.

1657
01:22:42,810 --> 01:22:44,729
We're expecting a big bag of money today.

1658
01:22:45,449 --> 01:22:46,090
The guy owes.

1659
01:22:46,090 --> 01:22:47,770
All right, I gotta ask you guys a really important question.

1660
01:22:47,770 --> 01:22:50,010
This is the definitive moment of the stream.

1661
01:22:50,010 --> 01:22:51,770
Yeah, this place is a real earner.

1662
01:22:51,770 --> 01:22:54,010
Is it mafia or mafia?

1663
01:22:54,010 --> 01:22:56,010
The places that give you the most dough are the ones most people all get twice.

1664
01:22:56,010 --> 01:22:57,609
A lot of people say mafia.

1665
01:22:57,609 --> 01:22:58,890
I'm going to be playing mafia.

1666
01:22:58,890 --> 01:23:00,329
I'm going to play mafia.

1667
01:23:00,329 --> 01:23:03,210
Last stop before I lost heaven for rum coming up from Cuba.

1668
01:23:03,210 --> 01:23:03,930
Oh, shit.

1669
01:23:03,930 --> 01:23:04,890
Is it good at this far?

1670
01:23:04,890 --> 01:23:05,609
Sure, they do.

1671
01:23:06,250 --> 01:23:08,729
And that's how we can sell it so expensive.

1672
01:23:08,729 --> 01:23:09,609
What am I talking about?

1673
01:23:09,609 --> 01:23:10,569
People say mafia.

1674
01:23:10,569 --> 01:23:10,890
Mafia.

1675
01:23:10,890 --> 01:23:12,409
The rates get exchanged.

1676
01:23:12,409 --> 01:23:13,529
Salieri protects it,

1677
01:23:13,529 --> 01:23:15,529
but he lets the other families use it too.

1678
01:23:15,529 --> 01:23:17,449
Even Barolo could keep the peace.

1679
01:23:17,449 --> 01:23:18,649
Not mafia.

1680
01:23:18,649 --> 01:23:20,970
Plus, it's far enough away that no one cares.

1681
01:23:20,970 --> 01:23:22,250
So long as everyone does that.

1682
01:23:22,250 --> 01:23:23,210
Yes, they do.

1683
01:23:23,210 --> 01:23:24,569
No one's going to rock the boat.

1684
01:23:28,829 --> 01:23:30,029
Yes, they do.

1685
01:23:30,029 --> 01:23:31,390
Be on the meter here, Tom.

1686
01:23:32,750 --> 01:23:34,430
I wouldn't be saying it if it wasn't true.

1687
01:23:34,430 --> 01:23:37,149
Anyone else starting to miss the side of the streets and sidewalks?

1688
01:23:37,149 --> 01:23:39,470
You're not one for the great outdoors, Polly.

1689
01:23:39,470 --> 01:23:41,149
He's not one for anything.

1690
01:23:41,149 --> 01:23:44,510
Indoors, out of the city.

1691
01:23:44,590 --> 01:23:45,090
Oh.

1692
01:23:46,750 --> 01:23:50,829
Like when we sit in the field doing some booze handover or something.

1693
01:23:50,829 --> 01:23:55,630
It's always knee-deep and shit and most times it's dark and cold as hell.

1694
01:23:55,630 --> 01:23:58,029
That's why it's good we got you now, Tom.

1695
01:23:58,029 --> 01:23:59,949
You can do all the jobs that Polly hates.

1696
01:23:59,949 --> 01:24:01,069
Make pronunciations.

1697
01:24:02,829 --> 01:24:05,390
I've heard people say mafia.

1698
01:24:06,029 --> 01:24:06,750
Mafia.

1699
01:24:06,750 --> 01:24:07,630
Mafia.

1700
01:24:07,630 --> 01:24:08,670
People say Mario.

1701
01:24:09,550 --> 01:24:10,430
Super Mario.

1702
01:24:10,430 --> 01:24:12,029
So it's not above what?

1703
01:24:12,029 --> 01:24:12,989
This is not even right.

1704
01:24:12,989 --> 01:24:14,510
He's just going to love you.

1705
01:24:22,060 --> 01:24:25,659
People say Super Mario and mostly they're over the age of 50.

1706
01:24:26,460 --> 01:24:30,539
Don't tell me that your parents did not call him Super Mario.

1707
01:24:31,420 --> 01:24:31,979
Yes, they did.

1708
01:24:37,960 --> 01:24:39,000
Those people are wrong.

1709
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:40,199
That doesn't mean they don't happen.

1710
01:24:50,380 --> 01:24:51,420
Cool, man.

1711
01:24:51,420 --> 01:24:59,869
The name Mario existed before that game.

1712
01:25:02,380 --> 01:25:02,880
So?

1713
01:25:05,659 --> 01:25:09,420
I'm not arguing the origins of the name Mario.

1714
01:25:09,420 --> 01:25:11,659
I just said some people pronounce it Mario.

1715
01:25:12,460 --> 01:25:23,880
Herman, you're like five years younger than my dad, Omega Lo.

1716
01:25:23,880 --> 01:25:24,520
No, I'm not.

1717
01:25:25,560 --> 01:25:26,760
Dad's like 39?

1718
01:25:27,479 --> 01:25:28,119
How old are you?

1719
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:35,420
Are you eight?

1720
01:25:35,420 --> 01:25:38,880
What are you doing here?

1721
01:25:38,880 --> 01:25:40,800
This is a legal stream for you to be on.

1722
01:25:46,859 --> 01:25:47,819
Look, it's...

1723
01:25:49,880 --> 01:25:50,439
Where's the rock?

1724
01:25:51,079 --> 01:25:53,039
There's no rock in there.

1725
01:25:59,229 --> 01:26:00,989
I was hoping for an explosion.

1726
01:26:00,989 --> 01:26:01,949
I'll be honest.

1727
01:26:01,949 --> 01:26:02,989
Okay, let me be...

1728
01:26:02,989 --> 01:26:03,869
I'll come clean here.

1729
01:26:04,270 --> 01:26:07,289
I was hoping it was a gas tank explosion.

1730
01:26:07,289 --> 01:26:08,090
I was going for it.

1731
01:26:41,079 --> 01:26:42,680
Wally, go do your thing.

1732
01:26:55,449 --> 01:27:00,560
Find a way into the motel, sure.

1733
01:27:01,199 --> 01:27:07,000
Got to be a secret wall here somewhere.

1734
01:27:07,960 --> 01:27:18,920
Okay, there would be no suspicion here.

1735
01:27:18,920 --> 01:27:20,520
You would think there was an animal outside.

1736
01:27:21,079 --> 01:27:21,960
Like a raccoon.

1737
01:27:22,520 --> 01:27:33,949
Let my friend go.

1738
01:27:34,510 --> 01:27:47,500
What's in here?

1739
01:27:47,500 --> 01:27:48,810
A bed.

1740
01:27:48,810 --> 01:27:53,180
Take care of all the thugs.

1741
01:27:53,180 --> 01:27:53,739
I will.

1742
01:27:53,739 --> 01:27:57,260
There's a thug over here.

1743
01:27:57,260 --> 01:28:06,189
Where is he?

1744
01:28:06,189 --> 01:28:08,840
Oh, shit, I thought he was sitting at the dinner table.

1745
01:28:08,840 --> 01:28:09,560
Is he underneath me?

1746
01:28:10,119 --> 01:28:18,029
Who the fuck is this guy?

1747
01:28:18,029 --> 01:28:28,439
The front door isn't going to open.

1748
01:28:30,970 --> 01:28:31,930
Okay, the floor...

1749
01:28:31,930 --> 01:28:32,649
Oh, fuck.

1750
01:28:32,649 --> 01:28:34,170
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1751
01:28:34,170 --> 01:28:36,010
The green indicator is not an enemy.

1752
01:28:51,479 --> 01:28:52,920
Oh, shit.

1753
01:28:53,560 --> 01:28:58,359
It's on classic mode.

1754
01:28:58,359 --> 01:28:59,159
He's so bad.

1755
01:28:59,159 --> 01:28:59,720
No, I'm not.

1756
01:28:59,720 --> 01:29:00,279
I'm...

1757
01:29:00,279 --> 01:29:01,560
All right, I'm kicking into overdrive.

1758
01:29:01,560 --> 01:29:02,439
I'm going for real.

1759
01:29:02,439 --> 01:29:04,760
You're going to die so many times.

1760
01:29:04,760 --> 01:29:05,319
Like, no, I'm not.

1761
01:29:05,319 --> 01:29:05,800
No, I'm not.

1762
01:29:05,800 --> 01:29:06,359
Watch this.

1763
01:29:06,359 --> 01:29:06,760
If I get...

1764
01:29:06,760 --> 01:29:09,560
Okay, if I take one fucking damage from here on out,

1765
01:29:11,319 --> 01:29:11,800
I will...

1766
01:29:12,520 --> 01:29:13,399
I will eat...

1767
01:29:13,399 --> 01:29:13,960
I will do...

1768
01:29:13,960 --> 01:29:16,720
I will do chubby bunny with marshmallows.

1769
01:29:16,720 --> 01:29:17,439
Like, in a week.

1770
01:29:18,430 --> 01:29:20,829
And I'll do a chubby bunny thing with marshmallows.

1771
01:29:20,829 --> 01:29:39,470
Hey, Jerma sucks.

1772
01:29:39,470 --> 01:29:40,590
Thanks for five subs.

1773
01:29:40,590 --> 01:29:53,850
Go back in, going this way.

1774
01:30:00,829 --> 01:30:02,670
Remember, I didn't say if I get spotted.

1775
01:30:02,989 --> 01:30:04,350
If I take damage...

1776
01:30:04,350 --> 01:30:27,840
Where the fuck is he going?

1777
01:30:27,840 --> 01:30:42,399
But no, if I don't care.

1778
01:30:42,399 --> 01:30:51,180
Who's in here?

1779
01:30:51,180 --> 01:30:55,239
Oh, shit.

1780
01:30:55,239 --> 01:30:55,720
I got to hide him.

1781
01:30:55,720 --> 01:31:05,310
I got to hide his body.

1782
01:31:05,310 --> 01:31:05,869
One...

1783
01:31:05,869 --> 01:31:08,750
Okay, we got one, two, three, four.

1784
01:31:08,750 --> 01:31:09,470
Oh, no.

1785
01:31:09,470 --> 01:31:10,590
There's a lot of people in here.

1786
01:31:10,590 --> 01:31:13,600
How many...

1787
01:31:13,600 --> 01:31:16,699
I used all my molotovs.

1788
01:31:16,699 --> 01:31:17,020
Shit.

1789
01:31:17,020 --> 01:31:17,819
Of course I did.

1790
01:31:17,819 --> 01:31:20,430
Okay, what if I shoot this guy in the head right now?

1791
01:31:20,430 --> 01:31:25,949
I didn't take any damage yet.

1792
01:31:25,949 --> 01:31:31,899
I didn't take any damage.

1793
01:31:31,899 --> 01:31:33,579
Fuck, chubby bunny.

1794
01:31:34,220 --> 01:31:46,750
I don't want to do that.

1795
01:31:46,750 --> 01:31:47,390
I don't want to do that.

1796
01:31:47,390 --> 01:31:49,550
Why didn't I say like 100 community subs?

1797
01:31:49,550 --> 01:31:50,750
I would rather do that.

1798
01:31:50,750 --> 01:31:54,079
I would rather give 100 community subs to this channel

1799
01:31:54,720 --> 01:31:55,930
Let's go.

1800
01:31:55,930 --> 01:31:57,050
Then do chubby bunny.

1801
01:31:58,670 --> 01:31:59,789
He wants to see that.

1802
01:31:59,789 --> 01:32:00,909
I don't want to see that.

1803
01:32:00,909 --> 01:32:01,710
And neither do you.

1804
01:32:10,430 --> 01:32:12,590
Fuck, I didn't think there was going to be like 10 people here.

1805
01:32:13,149 --> 01:32:26,750
Give me the knife.

1806
01:32:26,750 --> 01:32:31,529
I don't have any marshmallows.

1807
01:32:31,529 --> 01:32:32,489
I can't do it right now.

1808
01:32:33,130 --> 01:32:34,250
All right, give me the knife.

1809
01:32:34,250 --> 01:32:44,840
How come there's not a Metal Gear Solid like...

1810
01:32:45,640 --> 01:32:46,439
Huh?

1811
01:32:46,439 --> 01:32:54,680
Stab him.

1812
01:32:54,680 --> 01:33:00,109
Stab him in the head.

1813
01:33:00,109 --> 01:33:02,399
Oh, shit.

1814
01:33:02,399 --> 01:33:02,880
That guy's a gun.

1815
01:33:04,199 --> 01:33:05,239
Why wouldn't you have shot me?

1816
01:33:08,560 --> 01:33:09,119
Oh, fuck.

1817
01:33:09,119 --> 01:33:10,079
It's on hard mode.

1818
01:33:10,079 --> 01:33:11,520
It's on really difficult.

1819
01:33:11,520 --> 01:33:13,439
It's on classic mode, which is really hard.

1820
01:33:13,439 --> 01:33:14,880
Okay, I'm going to get it this time.

1821
01:33:15,439 --> 01:33:25,239
He's actually so bad at video games.

1822
01:33:25,239 --> 01:33:27,479
No, I'm on the mode where if you take one shot, you die.

1823
01:33:30,199 --> 01:33:30,840
Not this time.

1824
01:33:30,840 --> 01:33:31,319
Here we go.

1825
01:33:48,189 --> 01:33:49,310
Use the gun?

1826
01:33:49,310 --> 01:34:08,380
I don't need a gun.

1827
01:34:08,380 --> 01:34:10,300
All right, there's three guys downstairs.

1828
01:34:10,300 --> 01:34:13,039
Nobody in this bed.

1829
01:34:13,039 --> 01:34:14,239
Can I get anything in this...

1830
01:34:14,239 --> 01:34:15,680
What do you mean we'll find him?

1831
01:34:15,680 --> 01:34:20,729
Is there an animal out there?

1832
01:34:20,729 --> 01:34:23,899
Wait, that's the raccoon.

1833
01:34:23,899 --> 01:34:25,020
That was causing all the noise.

1834
01:34:25,020 --> 01:34:25,979
Right, okay.

1835
01:34:25,979 --> 01:34:33,500
Anybody coming?

1836
01:34:33,500 --> 01:34:43,000
All right, we're good.

1837
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:43,880
They sneaking.

1838
01:34:43,880 --> 01:34:49,789
I think there's a guy in here.

1839
01:34:49,789 --> 01:34:52,600
Yep, there's a guy out here.

1840
01:34:52,600 --> 01:34:53,319
I know there is.

1841
01:34:53,319 --> 01:35:04,729
There's reach for the window?

1842
01:35:04,729 --> 01:35:20,729
I'm trying to hit the fucking fox.

1843
01:35:20,729 --> 01:35:21,529
All right, what am I doing?

1844
01:35:31,069 --> 01:35:32,109
Is there nobody else up here?

1845
01:35:32,109 --> 01:35:37,760
There's a guy checking over there.

1846
01:35:37,760 --> 01:35:38,319
Checking over there.

1847
01:35:38,319 --> 01:35:41,800
Checking over there.

1848
01:35:41,800 --> 01:36:07,239
All right, it's gun time.

1849
01:36:07,239 --> 01:36:08,279
You have a DDT.

1850
01:36:08,279 --> 01:36:21,039
Oh, what?

1851
01:36:21,039 --> 01:36:22,239
It's a fake.

1852
01:36:22,239 --> 01:36:38,140
What the fuck just happened?

1853
01:36:38,140 --> 01:36:39,180
That was another player.

1854
01:36:40,890 --> 01:36:41,369
Stop it.

1855
01:36:43,079 --> 01:36:47,689
Why are you coming from?

1856
01:36:50,729 --> 01:36:51,050
What?

1857
01:37:02,510 --> 01:37:03,149
Open door?

1858
01:37:03,710 --> 01:37:04,510
They're all in there?

1859
01:37:04,510 --> 01:37:06,829
They're all just clown card into the room.

1860
01:37:09,869 --> 01:37:13,359
Okay, keyboard and mouse.

1861
01:37:13,359 --> 01:37:15,439
Oh, not fucking around anymore.

1862
01:37:15,439 --> 01:37:16,079
Here we go.

1863
01:37:16,079 --> 01:37:16,960
FPS mode.

1864
01:37:16,960 --> 01:37:26,090
Fuck this.

1865
01:37:26,090 --> 01:37:27,609
Why did he fall off?

1866
01:37:27,609 --> 01:37:35,479
Where you at?

1867
01:37:35,479 --> 01:37:41,609
Come on out.

1868
01:37:41,609 --> 01:37:42,250
Let's go.

1869
01:37:42,250 --> 01:37:48,430
Why is my sensitivity so high?

1870
01:37:48,430 --> 01:37:49,630
Because I didn't even change it.

1871
01:37:59,420 --> 01:38:00,060
So high.

1872
01:38:07,039 --> 01:38:07,840
Okay, hold on.

1873
01:38:07,840 --> 01:38:08,640
I got to fix that.

1874
01:38:08,640 --> 01:38:10,729
It's unbelievably high.

1875
01:38:10,729 --> 01:38:11,449
Game.

1876
01:38:11,449 --> 01:38:13,319
Controls.

1877
01:38:13,319 --> 01:38:14,600
Mouse sensitivity.

1878
01:38:14,600 --> 01:38:15,100
Yikes.

1879
01:38:41,550 --> 01:38:42,109
I can't.

1880
01:38:42,109 --> 01:38:43,630
I got to get through the first mission.

1881
01:38:43,630 --> 01:38:45,229
What do you mean pretending?

1882
01:38:45,229 --> 01:38:47,390
The guy just like glued to my body

1883
01:38:47,390 --> 01:38:49,310
and swung twice and hit me in the head and I died.

1884
01:38:49,310 --> 01:39:17,359
There's a guy right here.

1885
01:39:17,359 --> 01:39:22,159
How do you crouch?

1886
01:39:22,720 --> 01:39:30,140
Okay, fucking god damn it.

1887
01:39:30,140 --> 01:39:45,609
Just open the fucking door and die.

1888
01:39:45,609 --> 01:39:46,329
Got him.

1889
01:39:46,329 --> 01:39:56,359
I'm over here.

1890
01:39:59,689 --> 01:40:09,920
Where's somebody shooting?

1891
01:40:09,920 --> 01:40:14,590
I thought somebody was on the roof.

1892
01:40:14,590 --> 01:40:15,789
What the hell just happened?

1893
01:40:15,789 --> 01:40:16,909
Somebody shot me.

1894
01:40:16,909 --> 01:40:17,710
What happened?

1895
01:40:17,710 --> 01:40:23,319
I hear a guy sprinting.

1896
01:40:23,319 --> 01:40:23,960
I hear a guy sprinting.

1897
01:40:23,960 --> 01:40:24,840
I hear somebody sprinting.

1898
01:40:24,840 --> 01:40:35,770
Somebody sprinting.

1899
01:40:35,770 --> 01:40:40,989
I need help.

1900
01:40:40,989 --> 01:40:51,579
Nice.

1901
01:40:51,579 --> 01:40:52,619
Okay, we're good.

1902
01:40:52,619 --> 01:40:53,100
Oh, fuck.

1903
01:40:53,100 --> 01:40:53,819
Hold on.

1904
01:40:53,819 --> 01:41:02,720
This is fun.

1905
01:41:02,720 --> 01:41:08,640
All right, there's like one more guy in here

1906
01:41:08,640 --> 01:41:09,600
and then we're good.

1907
01:41:09,600 --> 01:41:26,880
Where is he?

1908
01:41:26,880 --> 01:41:28,920
Oh, okay, we're good.

1909
01:41:28,920 --> 01:41:30,199
One guy behind the pool table.

1910
01:41:30,199 --> 01:41:32,220
By the way, it's one of my favorite games.

1911
01:41:32,220 --> 01:41:34,760
Hiding behind my favorite game.

1912
01:41:34,760 --> 01:41:38,189
That it?

1913
01:42:00,220 --> 01:42:01,579
It was fucking hard.

1914
01:42:01,579 --> 01:42:02,939
Uh-oh, guy with a duffel bag.

1915
01:42:10,920 --> 01:42:12,199
Oh no, more of this.

1916
01:42:13,159 --> 01:42:17,069
Oh, got knocked over into your favorite game.

1917
01:42:19,470 --> 01:42:25,390
Don't run up over for a joke.

1918
01:42:26,109 --> 01:42:32,779
Shoot while driving.

1919
01:42:33,420 --> 01:42:41,369
No, don't shoot that person's car.

1920
01:42:41,369 --> 01:42:41,930
What did they do?

1921
01:42:42,569 --> 01:42:46,199
Somebody leaning out of the car trying to shoot at me?

1922
01:42:46,920 --> 01:42:49,640
This person's just in the fucking way.

1923
01:43:04,460 --> 01:43:05,500
Shoot at everyone.

1924
01:43:18,729 --> 01:43:19,689
Come on, dude.

1925
01:43:21,630 --> 01:43:23,149
Why?

1926
01:43:24,590 --> 01:43:26,989
Just use the car as a gun.

1927
01:43:27,949 --> 01:43:28,670
Catch the thug.

1928
01:43:28,670 --> 01:43:30,590
I'm going as fast as I can, man.

1929
01:43:31,310 --> 01:43:42,760
How am I supposed to shoot the guys?

1930
01:43:43,880 --> 01:43:44,760
Oh my god.

1931
01:43:46,520 --> 01:43:47,560
Stupid.

1932
01:43:48,939 --> 01:43:49,579
All right, we're good.

1933
01:43:54,909 --> 01:44:08,939
All right, wait till it gets like the indicator.

1934
01:44:09,579 --> 01:44:15,180
I'm just, I can't even aim this.

1935
01:44:15,180 --> 01:44:17,420
It's just, I guess I'm shooting at the back of their car.

1936
01:44:18,300 --> 01:44:24,510
That's why for a speed boost.

1937
01:44:28,430 --> 01:44:29,550
Spam it.

1938
01:44:29,550 --> 01:44:30,829
I don't think that's going to do anything for me.

1939
01:44:30,829 --> 01:44:39,640
Fucking asshole game.

1940
01:44:40,359 --> 01:44:42,010
It's not rocket science.

1941
01:44:42,010 --> 01:44:43,689
I was doing it.

1942
01:44:47,390 --> 01:44:52,989
I know, guys, I've been in this chair for like 30 years playing video games.

1943
01:44:52,989 --> 01:44:57,399
I know that you shoot the car, but I can't even aim the gun.

1944
01:45:00,569 --> 01:45:01,449
Got him.

1945
01:45:01,449 --> 01:45:05,470
I've been in this chair for 30 years.

1946
01:45:19,130 --> 01:45:20,010
Oh shit.

1947
01:45:20,810 --> 01:45:27,949
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1948
01:45:28,510 --> 01:45:31,069
Please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please don't do this to me.

1949
01:45:31,869 --> 01:45:35,399
Fucking aiming and driving with a controller.

1950
01:45:35,399 --> 01:45:39,239
I may as well dunk my head under water and fucking just start gulping.

1951
01:45:55,739 --> 01:45:57,899
I may as well just put my head under water and scream.

1952
01:46:06,460 --> 01:46:07,819
Okay, this is the one right here.

1953
01:46:07,819 --> 01:46:08,220
This is the one.

1954
01:46:15,560 --> 01:46:16,760
Oh fucking, I can't.

1955
01:46:16,760 --> 01:46:18,359
I hope you guys forget about the chubby bunny thing.

1956
01:46:18,359 --> 01:46:18,840
I really do.

1957
01:46:36,109 --> 01:46:36,909
Am I even hitting him?

1958
01:46:45,689 --> 01:46:46,729
I'm hitting him, I guess.

1959
01:46:47,529 --> 01:47:03,369
I don't hit a fucking tree.

1960
01:47:03,369 --> 01:47:04,090
I love a god.

1961
01:47:04,729 --> 01:47:17,579
All right, I got it.

1962
01:47:17,579 --> 01:47:17,819
I got it.

1963
01:47:17,819 --> 01:47:18,220
This is the one.

1964
01:47:18,220 --> 01:47:18,539
This is the one.

1965
01:47:18,539 --> 01:47:19,020
This is the run.

1966
01:47:28,439 --> 01:47:29,239
Watch out for the rocks.

1967
01:47:47,319 --> 01:47:47,880
Come on, dude.

1968
01:47:47,880 --> 01:47:48,199
Really?

1969
01:47:51,319 --> 01:47:51,560
Out.

1970
01:47:52,119 --> 01:47:53,399
You're not turning to me.

1971
01:47:53,399 --> 01:48:01,869
Is he dead?

1972
01:48:01,869 --> 01:48:02,510
Search the car.

1973
01:48:02,510 --> 01:48:02,909
Get out.

1974
01:48:17,130 --> 01:48:18,010
30 years in this chair.

1975
01:48:18,010 --> 01:48:18,890
That's how you show up.

1976
01:48:18,890 --> 01:48:20,250
Everybody how you do it.

1977
01:48:20,250 --> 01:48:20,649
All right.

1978
01:48:20,649 --> 01:48:23,050
That was a really bad victory fucking exclamation.

1979
01:48:23,050 --> 01:48:28,750
I don't know what the hell I was trying to say.

1980
01:48:28,750 --> 01:48:29,390
Chapter complete.

1981
01:48:30,649 --> 01:48:31,529
Intermezzo.

1982
01:48:44,510 --> 01:48:47,069
30 years just to do a chubby bunny stream.

1983
01:48:49,560 --> 01:48:51,000
That's going to be so embarrassing.

1984
01:49:04,510 --> 01:49:06,750
Thanks, you boy, for the 10 community subs.

1985
01:49:07,949 --> 01:49:08,430
Raglan.

1986
01:49:08,430 --> 01:49:08,930
Thank you.

1987
01:49:10,670 --> 01:49:11,949
10 subs dropped right now.

1988
01:49:13,069 --> 01:49:13,550
Thanks a lot.

1989
01:49:14,989 --> 01:49:15,869
Have the run of the city.

1990
01:49:16,430 --> 01:49:18,270
For every buck sellier he made.

1991
01:49:18,270 --> 01:49:20,109
Don Morello would turn 10.

1992
01:49:20,109 --> 01:49:24,109
He paid off cops, politicians, judges, and anyone he couldn't buy.

1993
01:49:24,109 --> 01:49:25,710
He scared him to look in the other way.

1994
01:49:26,350 --> 01:49:27,789
Kermit, that can actually kill you.

1995
01:49:27,789 --> 01:49:29,710
It's not the city jumping in its own shadow.

1996
01:49:29,710 --> 01:49:30,430
I'll give you that.

1997
01:49:31,229 --> 01:49:31,470
What?

1998
01:49:31,470 --> 01:49:33,149
Do you hear anything about Joey Crackers?

1999
01:49:33,949 --> 01:49:35,470
Yeah, got his name in the Moretto file.

2000
01:49:35,470 --> 01:49:36,029
Sure.

2001
01:49:36,029 --> 01:49:36,829
Boxer, right?

2002
01:49:37,630 --> 01:49:38,130
Yeah.

2003
01:49:38,909 --> 01:49:39,550
That's the guy.

2004
01:49:40,350 --> 01:49:42,109
I could die from chubby bunny.

2005
01:49:42,909 --> 01:49:47,039
Kids have died doing chubby bunny before.

2006
01:49:54,350 --> 01:49:55,149
I'll be very careful.

2007
01:49:55,710 --> 01:49:56,989
I'll dunk him in water first.

2008
01:50:09,100 --> 01:50:10,060
No, I'm not going to eat them.

2009
01:50:14,939 --> 01:50:20,409
I'm going to turn the cam off and I'm going to do a big smear puke out of my mouth.

2010
01:50:22,489 --> 01:50:23,529
Into like a trash can.

2011
01:50:28,880 --> 01:50:29,600
My fault.

2012
01:50:29,600 --> 01:50:34,670
No, I just, I just, I ain't never been in no accident.

2013
01:50:35,609 --> 01:50:38,569
Well, repairs are going to be expensive.

2014
01:50:39,449 --> 01:50:43,289
Oh, you're not going to need that, sir.

2015
01:50:43,930 --> 01:50:44,729
Tires are just fine.

2016
01:50:45,369 --> 01:50:46,489
Grill's a little bent up is all.

2017
01:50:46,489 --> 01:50:47,449
I mean, I got a cousin I could...

2018
01:50:48,729 --> 01:50:49,229
What?

2019
01:50:50,489 --> 01:50:57,640
And that's how you went to jail for the rest of your life.

2020
01:51:00,029 --> 01:51:00,529
Hey.

2021
01:51:01,149 --> 01:51:13,100
Someone spun you a tale, pal.

2022
01:51:13,659 --> 01:51:18,220
You got an informant right there says Morello made a mint every time Crackers went to the mat.

2023
01:51:18,220 --> 01:51:19,020
That's true, too.

2024
01:51:19,819 --> 01:51:23,420
And still Morello left that poor, sad, dead in the street.

2025
01:51:23,420 --> 01:51:26,699
Pizza Hut, a warm-up box thing when they delivered the pizza.

2026
01:51:27,260 --> 01:51:28,539
All right, I wasn't paying attention.

2027
01:51:28,539 --> 01:51:29,739
I could've, I could've been funnier.

2028
01:51:29,739 --> 01:51:32,300
Maybe to Don, though Joey's career was on the downhill.

2029
01:51:32,300 --> 01:51:34,220
Maybe he was trying to scare someone, a guy in a pay-in-off.

2030
01:51:34,220 --> 01:51:34,720
Who knows?

2031
01:51:35,739 --> 01:51:39,420
Don Celieri chalked it up to Morello not being able to think straight when he was mad.

2032
01:51:39,420 --> 01:51:41,579
I love when people get so pissed off.

2033
01:51:42,779 --> 01:51:45,340
It's just like, what the fuck is he talking about?

2034
01:51:45,340 --> 01:51:47,100
Do you have any more run-ins with...

2035
01:51:47,100 --> 01:51:48,220
It gives me energy.

2036
01:51:48,859 --> 01:51:49,500
Not at first.

2037
01:51:50,140 --> 01:51:53,229
For a couple of years after I joined up, things were quiet.

2038
01:51:54,029 --> 01:51:56,430
We got into a few dust-ups with guys trying to muscle in.

2039
01:51:56,430 --> 01:51:58,989
But else-wise, it was just the usual routine.

2040
01:51:58,989 --> 01:52:01,100
Who's out for protection?

2041
01:52:01,100 --> 01:52:03,500
Me and the boys doing rounds to collect small time.

2042
01:52:03,500 --> 01:52:03,899
What is it?

2043
01:52:03,899 --> 01:52:05,020
What is it, Chubby Bunny?

2044
01:52:05,020 --> 01:52:06,380
I ain't gonna lie.

2045
01:52:06,380 --> 01:52:11,739
You get marshmallows and you put them in your cheeks and you say Chubby Bunny after you put one in.

2046
01:52:12,460 --> 01:52:14,250
I'm not gonna do that many.

2047
01:52:14,250 --> 01:52:16,489
I'm not gonna do a dangerous amount of marshmallows.

2048
01:52:16,489 --> 01:52:19,130
Guys, I'm not gonna put enough marshmallows to kill me in my mouth.

2049
01:52:19,130 --> 01:52:22,090
I'm just gonna do enough for it to be accurate.

2050
01:52:56,380 --> 01:52:57,340
It's a great investment.

2051
01:52:57,340 --> 01:52:59,899
The kid can't lose a race if he walks the track.

2052
01:53:00,539 --> 01:53:05,100
He graduates from the Junkers to Gowjobs, and I start placing a few bets on him here and there.

2053
01:53:05,100 --> 01:53:07,899
Next thing I know, I've made all my money back and more.

2054
01:53:08,460 --> 01:53:10,380
Hey, Sam says he's the guy to beat.

2055
01:53:10,380 --> 01:53:10,880
He was.

2056
01:53:11,739 --> 01:53:13,979
We ran all the competition out of town.

2057
01:53:13,979 --> 01:53:15,500
But now Ralph says there's a hot-sock European...

2058
01:53:15,500 --> 01:53:16,380
Here it comes.

2059
01:53:16,380 --> 01:53:17,260
Here it comes.

2060
01:53:17,260 --> 01:53:17,739
Oh, fuck.

2061
01:53:17,739 --> 01:53:19,819
And he's got a car faster than our boys...

2062
01:53:19,819 --> 01:53:21,180
Five-hour mission.

2063
01:53:21,180 --> 01:53:21,420
Okay.

2064
01:53:21,420 --> 01:53:22,939
How much do we stand to lose?

2065
01:53:22,939 --> 01:53:23,659
A truckload.

2066
01:53:24,220 --> 01:53:25,979
But not just our outfit.

2067
01:53:25,979 --> 01:53:29,520
A lot of guys from the neighborhood come to me for financial advice.

2068
01:53:29,520 --> 01:53:31,760
They've all put money down on this kid.

2069
01:53:31,760 --> 01:53:35,199
It'll be like Black Thursday around here if he loses.

2070
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:38,479
Well, for everyone except Morello.

2071
01:53:38,479 --> 01:53:40,079
No, you think he's from the European?

2072
01:53:40,079 --> 01:53:40,800
Oh, I'm certain of it.

2073
01:53:40,800 --> 01:53:42,720
Odd friends, skip 10 hours.

2074
01:53:42,720 --> 01:53:44,479
He wants something to happen to the driver.

2075
01:53:44,479 --> 01:53:45,199
Can't find him.

2076
01:53:45,199 --> 01:53:49,439
You're giving me a lot of power here to want to beat this really, really quickly and really skillfully.

2077
01:53:49,439 --> 01:53:50,720
...disappears now?

2078
01:53:50,720 --> 01:53:52,239
None of our wagers will stand.

2079
01:53:52,239 --> 01:53:54,750
Five fouls and a race is fixed.

2080
01:53:54,750 --> 01:53:57,520
What about his car?

2081
01:53:57,520 --> 01:53:59,720
That's the ticket, Tommy.

2082
01:53:59,720 --> 01:54:02,439
Ralph knows a guard at the track.

2083
01:54:02,439 --> 01:54:07,159
You go down there tonight, you boost the Europeans' car, bring it to one of our mechanics.

2084
01:54:07,159 --> 01:54:09,079
I'll make a few adjustments when you bring the car back.

2085
01:54:09,079 --> 01:54:10,279
Should be no problem, boss.

2086
01:54:14,140 --> 01:54:14,640
Okay.

2087
01:54:16,140 --> 01:54:16,779
Talk to Ralph.

2088
01:54:25,579 --> 01:54:29,579
Odd viewers, skip to two hours and 36 minutes and 14 seconds for the next mission.

2089
01:54:33,439 --> 01:54:34,399
That's very specific.

2090
01:54:45,119 --> 01:54:47,369
Hey, Titi Tommy.

2091
01:54:47,369 --> 01:54:48,649
Big day coming up, right?

2092
01:54:49,529 --> 01:54:50,329
Hey, no.

2093
01:54:50,329 --> 01:54:51,130
Time traveler.

2094
01:54:51,130 --> 01:54:52,250
Kinda hard to miss.

2095
01:54:52,250 --> 01:54:52,810
I'm still here.

2096
01:54:52,810 --> 01:54:55,130
He isn't going to let Morello break his winning streak, huh?

2097
01:54:55,130 --> 01:54:56,170
No, no, sir.

2098
01:54:56,170 --> 01:54:58,010
I had to send him a message.

2099
01:54:58,010 --> 01:55:02,140
So tonight, borrow his guy's motor from the track.

2100
01:55:02,140 --> 01:55:03,819
My friend Bobby is a guard.

2101
01:55:03,819 --> 01:55:08,779
For a little dough, he'll show you where it is and look someplace else while you t-t-t-turn the key.

2102
01:55:08,779 --> 01:55:10,060
You like Bobby already?

2103
01:55:11,020 --> 01:55:11,520
Sure.

2104
01:55:11,979 --> 01:55:14,859
Get in there, there's a Sutter guy, L-L-Lucas Bertone.

2105
01:55:14,939 --> 01:55:18,460
You take the car to him down under the Ju-Ju-Giuliano Bridge.

2106
01:55:18,460 --> 01:55:20,779
He'll, you know, tune it a little.

2107
01:55:20,779 --> 01:55:23,180
Make the race tomorrow more, more, more interesting.

2108
01:55:23,180 --> 01:55:27,020
Then I take the car straight back and Bobby can stop looking someplace else.

2109
01:55:27,020 --> 01:55:28,380
But you gotta be quick.

2110
01:55:28,380 --> 01:55:33,260
Bobby comes off shift at 1.30 and then the next guy, he's an ass.

2111
01:55:33,260 --> 01:55:35,260
Am I saying the Travis Scott Burger?

2112
01:55:35,260 --> 01:55:37,020
This mission made me cry growing up.

2113
01:55:37,020 --> 01:55:41,819
Hey, if you need somewhere to keep your m-motor seat where no one can take them,

2114
01:55:41,819 --> 01:55:43,340
feel free to use the garage.

2115
01:55:43,340 --> 01:55:44,989
Oh, because you just saw the ad.

2116
01:55:45,069 --> 01:55:46,590
Right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right.

2117
01:55:46,590 --> 01:55:51,260
Everyone saying that just saw the ad.

2118
01:55:51,260 --> 01:55:55,659
Right, right, I forgot.

2119
01:55:55,659 --> 01:55:56,300
Oh, shit.

2120
01:55:57,020 --> 01:55:57,340
All right.

2121
01:55:58,140 --> 01:55:58,859
What do I got?

2122
01:55:58,859 --> 01:56:00,140
Taxi, six, the V8.

2123
01:56:02,010 --> 01:56:03,050
Yeah, I want the V8, man.

2124
01:56:03,050 --> 01:56:03,529
You kidding me?

2125
01:56:03,529 --> 01:56:04,170
This thing's sick.

2126
01:56:08,079 --> 01:56:09,920
Add V8s to the garage by driving them.

2127
01:56:11,039 --> 01:56:12,079
Meet with the guard at the racetrack.

2128
01:56:12,079 --> 01:56:12,960
All right, this is a fast car.

2129
01:56:13,520 --> 01:56:20,720
This is the last mission everybody plays before dropping the game.

2130
01:56:24,649 --> 01:56:25,149
Okay.

2131
01:56:26,090 --> 01:56:33,979
This is the second mission in the whole game, realistically speaking.

2132
01:56:34,699 --> 01:56:36,350
Can you pass on the left in the 30s?

2133
01:56:38,590 --> 01:56:39,090
Yes.

2134
01:56:39,409 --> 01:56:48,930
I want a motorcycle so bad.

2135
01:56:48,930 --> 01:56:49,729
I want- I'm gonna do-

2136
01:56:49,729 --> 01:56:50,850
No, I'm gonna do motorcycle.

2137
01:56:50,850 --> 01:56:51,250
No, I'm not.

2138
01:56:51,250 --> 01:56:52,050
It's gone already.

2139
01:56:52,050 --> 01:56:52,550
Never mind.

2140
01:56:53,250 --> 01:57:04,590
You guys are really talking up this mission.

2141
01:57:05,310 --> 01:57:10,880
Dude, I gotta prepare for this then.

2142
01:57:11,520 --> 01:57:29,460
A long way away, isn't it?

2143
01:57:30,180 --> 01:57:37,300
All right, here we go.

2144
01:57:37,300 --> 01:57:43,710
You Bobby?

2145
01:57:43,710 --> 01:57:44,510
Yep.

2146
01:57:44,510 --> 01:57:46,029
We can take your car to the garage.

2147
01:57:46,029 --> 01:57:46,909
Place is empty.

2148
01:57:46,909 --> 01:57:47,949
What, I have to suit this thing up?

2149
01:57:47,949 --> 01:57:49,069
Your friend Ralphie's a friend of mine.

2150
01:57:49,069 --> 01:57:50,270
I mean, if you got the money, sure.

2151
01:57:51,229 --> 01:57:56,739
30 years of gaming about to come to an end.

2152
01:57:56,739 --> 01:57:58,100
Tomorrow morning they start coming.

2153
01:57:58,659 --> 01:57:59,939
Whole city.

2154
01:57:59,939 --> 01:58:00,979
They smuggle in hooch.

2155
01:58:01,619 --> 01:58:02,340
There's fighting.

2156
01:58:02,819 --> 01:58:04,720
I hate it.

2157
01:58:04,720 --> 01:58:06,159
Ah, come mine.

2158
01:58:06,159 --> 01:58:09,439
Name a better place to pick up a date than this place this weekend.

2159
01:58:09,439 --> 01:58:10,399
Don't get me started.

2160
01:58:11,630 --> 01:58:12,829
Big brain cigarettes?

2161
01:58:13,550 --> 01:58:20,479
All right, here we are.

2162
01:58:21,039 --> 01:58:24,300
This is it.

2163
01:58:24,300 --> 01:58:31,550
All right, I'm just stretching.

2164
01:58:31,550 --> 01:58:40,350
Ooh, there she is.

2165
01:58:40,350 --> 01:58:42,189
99 Karazela C-Series.

2166
01:58:42,189 --> 01:58:43,390
Best in class.

2167
01:58:43,390 --> 01:58:45,439
It's a shame you gotta wreck it.

2168
01:58:45,439 --> 01:58:46,939
If they see this down the road,

2169
01:58:47,739 --> 01:58:49,100
the cops are gonna ask questions.

2170
01:58:49,899 --> 01:58:52,939
Try to keep it in one piece, too.

2171
01:58:52,939 --> 01:58:54,619
Try to keep it in one piece and-

2172
01:58:54,619 --> 01:58:56,699
So, I gotta be back from Breton by 1.30

2173
01:58:56,699 --> 01:58:57,819
before the next guy shifts.

2174
01:58:58,619 --> 01:59:00,449
Yeah.

2175
01:59:00,449 --> 01:59:01,489
It's timed, is that what it is?

2176
01:59:02,130 --> 01:59:02,770
It's timed.

2177
01:59:02,770 --> 01:59:03,729
Okay, let's go.

2178
01:59:04,689 --> 01:59:21,539
We're good.

2179
01:59:21,539 --> 01:59:23,840
Just keep the car in one piece, get back in two minutes.

2180
01:59:33,409 --> 01:59:35,409
Holy shit, this thing is fast.

2181
01:59:42,380 --> 01:59:42,939
It's all right.

2182
01:59:42,939 --> 01:59:44,380
I got one guy looking at me.

2183
01:59:44,939 --> 01:59:58,880
We're good.

2184
01:59:58,880 --> 01:59:59,600
So far, so good.

2185
02:00:00,319 --> 02:00:01,600
I'm at 50% damage.

2186
02:00:06,880 --> 02:00:08,560
Oh, get this thing out of the way.

2187
02:00:08,560 --> 02:00:09,279
What the fuck are you doing?

2188
02:00:18,640 --> 02:00:19,439
I got a full minute.

2189
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:21,039
We're gonna take shortcut.

2190
02:00:21,760 --> 02:00:30,460
Shit.

2191
02:00:30,460 --> 02:00:32,140
Shortcut to the checkpoint is what I meant.

2192
02:00:32,619 --> 02:00:39,619
Restart.

2193
02:00:39,619 --> 02:00:40,579
Already don't like it.

2194
02:00:40,579 --> 02:00:42,140
Bad start.

2195
02:00:42,140 --> 02:00:42,539
Bad start.

2196
02:00:42,539 --> 02:00:43,020
All right.

2197
02:00:43,020 --> 02:00:43,659
Really bad start.

2198
02:00:43,659 --> 02:00:44,140
Just restart.

2199
02:00:44,859 --> 02:00:47,680
Or not.

2200
02:00:47,680 --> 02:00:48,000
Let's see.

2201
02:00:48,560 --> 02:00:51,500
All right.

2202
02:00:51,500 --> 02:00:52,619
The handling is insane.

2203
02:00:52,619 --> 02:00:53,420
So, just slow down.

2204
02:00:54,220 --> 02:01:10,659
How do I re-

2205
02:01:10,659 --> 02:01:11,619
Just restart from checkpoint.

2206
02:01:21,819 --> 02:01:23,100
Punch yourself in the face?

2207
02:01:25,949 --> 02:01:26,350
All right.

2208
02:01:26,350 --> 02:01:26,750
Easy.

2209
02:01:26,750 --> 02:01:27,470
Don't go crazy.

2210
02:01:28,029 --> 02:01:30,460
You probably don't have to go that fast.

2211
02:01:30,460 --> 02:01:32,220
It's just addicting to go fast in this game.

2212
02:01:33,180 --> 02:01:33,500
Okay.

2213
02:01:33,500 --> 02:01:34,300
Slow down.

2214
02:01:34,300 --> 02:01:34,779
Big turn.

2215
02:01:35,579 --> 02:01:41,680
That was stupid.

2216
02:01:41,680 --> 02:01:49,220
I touched the bumper.

2217
02:01:49,220 --> 02:01:49,460
Okay.

2218
02:01:49,460 --> 02:01:50,899
So, bounce me across the whole game.

2219
02:01:51,699 --> 02:02:00,140
I just gotta get good car spawns and I'll be fine.

2220
02:02:00,859 --> 02:02:07,199
Pass this guy on the right and then lean to the left a little.

2221
02:02:08,159 --> 02:02:08,720
The right, I mean.

2222
02:02:11,489 --> 02:02:12,609
Sidewalk drive if you can.

2223
02:02:13,329 --> 02:02:15,199
Okay.

2224
02:02:15,199 --> 02:02:15,600
We're fine.

2225
02:02:16,159 --> 02:02:31,380
Right down the middle.

2226
02:02:31,380 --> 02:02:33,819
Right down the middle.

2227
02:02:33,819 --> 02:02:34,060
Right.

2228
02:02:34,619 --> 02:02:35,279
Slow down.

2229
02:02:35,840 --> 02:02:39,539
Losing control.

2230
02:02:40,180 --> 02:03:01,300
I got one minute.

2231
02:03:01,300 --> 02:03:08,079
How much further is it?

2232
02:03:08,640 --> 02:03:15,340
It's right there.

2233
02:03:15,340 --> 02:03:15,819
It's right there.

2234
02:03:15,819 --> 02:03:17,020
I got 39 seconds.

2235
02:03:17,020 --> 02:03:17,979
Hardest mission in the game.

2236
02:03:17,979 --> 02:03:18,539
You kidding me?

2237
02:03:18,539 --> 02:03:18,939
I'm done.

2238
02:03:19,500 --> 02:03:30,699
It was so hard.

2239
02:03:30,699 --> 02:03:30,939
Yeah.

2240
02:03:30,939 --> 02:03:32,220
I mean, it was tricky.

2241
02:03:32,939 --> 02:03:41,039
Oh, that's not a garage door that opens.

2242
02:03:41,039 --> 02:03:41,760
Oh, shit.

2243
02:03:50,659 --> 02:03:50,979
I'm good.

2244
02:03:55,409 --> 02:03:56,210
We don't have much time.

2245
02:03:57,279 --> 02:03:59,199
Hey, I'm a fast worker.

2246
02:03:59,199 --> 02:03:59,760
Sit tight.

2247
02:04:06,659 --> 02:04:07,220
Hey, hey.

2248
02:04:07,220 --> 02:04:08,020
You want a health stick?

2249
02:04:08,659 --> 02:04:09,060
Yeah, sure.

2250
02:04:09,060 --> 02:04:10,340
I'll take a health stick.

2251
02:04:10,340 --> 02:04:22,380
Okay.

2252
02:04:22,380 --> 02:04:22,699
Now what?

2253
02:04:22,699 --> 02:04:23,260
Thanks, Lucas.

2254
02:04:24,060 --> 02:04:26,590
I gotta get back before anyone catches on.

2255
02:04:26,590 --> 02:04:28,109
This turns on with 10 seconds left.

2256
02:04:28,109 --> 02:04:29,069
I'm gonna laugh my ass off.

2257
02:04:29,949 --> 02:04:30,670
Misbehave.

2258
02:04:32,180 --> 02:04:34,579
Hey, tell Mr. Salieri.

2259
02:04:34,579 --> 02:04:36,579
I'm always available for this kind of work.

2260
02:04:36,579 --> 02:04:38,020
I do stuff for a lot of people.

2261
02:04:38,579 --> 02:04:40,420
But I always know where I stand with you guys.

2262
02:04:42,239 --> 02:04:42,880
Hot cars.

2263
02:04:43,520 --> 02:04:44,159
Getaways.

2264
02:04:45,039 --> 02:04:46,399
Anything for the right price.

2265
02:04:46,960 --> 02:04:48,960
Let's just hope Salieri's guy wins tomorrow.

2266
02:04:50,159 --> 02:04:51,920
For all our sakes.

2267
02:04:52,640 --> 02:04:53,199
Okay.

2268
02:04:53,199 --> 02:04:54,399
It's gonna misbehave.

2269
02:04:54,399 --> 02:04:55,119
I'm careful.

2270
02:05:02,979 --> 02:05:03,539
Two minutes.

2271
02:05:05,649 --> 02:05:06,689
Okay, I got two minutes.

2272
02:05:07,329 --> 02:05:10,800
It's gonna misbehave.

2273
02:05:10,800 --> 02:05:13,199
Is that what the engine indicator thing on top is supposed to mean?

2274
02:05:13,920 --> 02:05:14,939
What happens if it...

2275
02:05:14,939 --> 02:05:16,619
Okay, so it can't get that hot.

2276
02:05:16,619 --> 02:05:18,220
Don't hold the minigun down for that long.

2277
02:05:18,859 --> 02:05:30,079
This is an easy straightaway.

2278
02:05:30,720 --> 02:05:34,979
No, and shit just knocks you around too.

2279
02:05:34,979 --> 02:05:36,180
It bounces you around.

2280
02:05:36,180 --> 02:05:36,659
It's all right.

2281
02:05:36,659 --> 02:05:38,579
This is not as bad as I thought it was gonna be.

2282
02:05:39,539 --> 02:05:40,880
Pull it down.

2283
02:05:40,880 --> 02:05:41,359
Punch it.

2284
02:05:41,920 --> 02:05:51,680
To the right and then to the right.

2285
02:05:52,829 --> 02:05:53,229
Move.

2286
02:05:54,029 --> 02:06:02,350
All right.

2287
02:06:02,350 --> 02:06:03,710
Wrong side of the road.

2288
02:06:03,710 --> 02:06:05,069
That's where I shine the most.

2289
02:06:23,739 --> 02:06:24,909
I'm almost there.

2290
02:06:24,909 --> 02:06:25,390
I'm almost there.

2291
02:06:25,390 --> 02:06:26,029
Just get out of the way.

2292
02:06:26,670 --> 02:06:40,460
32 seconds.

2293
02:06:40,460 --> 02:06:40,859
I got it.

2294
02:06:41,420 --> 02:06:44,430
Move.

2295
02:06:44,430 --> 02:06:44,909
Out of the way.

2296
02:06:45,470 --> 02:06:46,819
Right here.

2297
02:06:46,819 --> 02:06:47,380
25 seconds.

2298
02:06:48,020 --> 02:06:49,710
Shortcut.

2299
02:06:49,710 --> 02:06:51,069
Should I do a shortcut or just do it?

2300
02:06:59,329 --> 02:06:59,970
12 seconds.

2301
02:07:01,539 --> 02:07:02,100
10 seconds.

2302
02:07:04,270 --> 02:07:04,909
8 seconds.

2303
02:07:06,939 --> 02:07:07,260
5.

2304
02:07:07,899 --> 02:07:08,220
4.

2305
02:07:18,850 --> 02:07:25,579
I thought I could go through the fence somehow.

2306
02:07:25,579 --> 02:07:25,819
All right.

2307
02:07:25,819 --> 02:07:26,300
Here we go.

2308
02:07:31,039 --> 02:07:31,680
Don't let up.

2309
02:07:31,680 --> 02:07:32,399
I'm gonna get there.

2310
02:07:32,399 --> 02:07:33,039
Here we go.

2311
02:07:33,039 --> 02:07:34,000
You know I should go the other way.

2312
02:07:34,720 --> 02:07:38,239
Idiot.

2313
02:07:38,800 --> 02:07:39,869
Fucking idiot.

2314
02:07:39,869 --> 02:07:40,829
That's not even my fault.

2315
02:07:49,859 --> 02:07:50,260
All right.

2316
02:07:50,260 --> 02:07:51,779
What happens if the thing goes all the way up?

2317
02:07:51,779 --> 02:07:52,579
Does it explode?

2318
02:07:53,380 --> 02:08:07,039
As long as I keep it under that bar, I'm fine.

2319
02:08:08,750 --> 02:08:09,949
Damage doesn't make it go higher.

2320
02:08:10,510 --> 02:08:10,989
I'm okay.

2321
02:08:11,630 --> 02:08:17,260
That was a pretty clean transition out of that spot.

2322
02:08:17,260 --> 02:08:17,979
That's a hard spot.

2323
02:08:17,979 --> 02:08:18,539
That's a hard turn.

2324
02:08:24,260 --> 02:08:25,060
Wrong side of the road.

2325
02:08:31,170 --> 02:08:31,810
Good.

2326
02:08:31,810 --> 02:08:35,060
Oh my god.

2327
02:08:35,060 --> 02:08:36,340
I almost just hit the side.

2328
02:08:37,220 --> 02:08:37,539
Sorry.

2329
02:08:38,420 --> 02:08:48,689
All right.

2330
02:08:48,689 --> 02:08:49,010
Watch out.

2331
02:08:49,010 --> 02:08:49,329
Watch out.

2332
02:08:49,329 --> 02:08:50,369
That rice-a-roni truck.

2333
02:08:51,659 --> 02:08:52,699
You dick.

2334
02:08:52,699 --> 02:08:52,859
Okay.

2335
02:08:52,859 --> 02:08:53,899
That's the part that's gonna be a problem.

2336
02:08:53,899 --> 02:09:09,739
I think I still got it.

2337
02:09:09,739 --> 02:09:17,100
20 seconds.

2338
02:09:24,079 --> 02:09:25,680
That was close.

2339
02:09:25,680 --> 02:09:27,279
I filled it all the way up.

2340
02:09:27,279 --> 02:09:28,560
That was really close.

2341
02:09:28,560 --> 02:09:31,520
That would have been a 500-yard shot if a golf game was in this.

2342
02:09:38,979 --> 02:09:39,619
Oh, dude.

2343
02:09:39,619 --> 02:09:40,420
This is impossible.

2344
02:09:40,420 --> 02:09:41,779
This mission's not even completable.

2345
02:09:42,420 --> 02:09:45,250
Did I win?

2346
02:09:45,890 --> 02:09:57,470
Come on.

2347
02:09:57,470 --> 02:10:02,560
Oh, wow.

2348
02:10:03,119 --> 02:10:04,319
You just get...

2349
02:10:04,319 --> 02:10:04,800
All right.

2350
02:10:04,800 --> 02:10:05,520
That's not bad.

2351
02:10:14,529 --> 02:10:15,329
All right.

2352
02:10:15,329 --> 02:10:18,270
That wasn't that bad.

2353
02:10:18,350 --> 02:10:20,270
Okay. Let's get out of here.

2354
02:10:20,270 --> 02:10:22,720
Big day tomorrow.

2355
02:10:22,720 --> 02:10:23,359
Oh, wow.

2356
02:10:23,359 --> 02:10:26,880
We just got a monster raid from Kitboga.

2357
02:10:27,520 --> 02:10:29,600
What's going on, guys?

2358
02:10:29,600 --> 02:10:30,800
Welcome to the stream.

2359
02:10:30,800 --> 02:10:32,159
Thank you, Kitboga, for the raid.

2360
02:10:32,159 --> 02:10:32,560
That's a...

2361
02:10:32,560 --> 02:10:33,840
Yeah, it's a monster raid.

2362
02:10:34,479 --> 02:10:37,300
Hope you had a good stream, dude.

2363
02:10:37,300 --> 02:10:39,340
So Sam walks out of the bathroom...

2364
02:10:39,340 --> 02:10:41,420
We're playing Mafia Remastered.

2365
02:10:41,420 --> 02:10:45,420
...because our tenor's gonna hand over what he owes.

2366
02:10:45,420 --> 02:10:46,380
And his two sons...

2367
02:10:46,380 --> 02:10:47,020
Gonna be fun?

2368
02:10:47,020 --> 02:10:48,060
...closer.

2369
02:10:48,060 --> 02:10:52,180
Some of the most fun I've had in a long time was on Kit's stream.

2370
02:10:52,180 --> 02:10:55,310
...feel like brick shithouses.

2371
02:10:55,310 --> 02:10:56,909
The pleasure to have you here.

2372
02:10:56,909 --> 02:10:57,310
Welcome.

2373
02:10:58,029 --> 02:11:00,590
...his crazy bastard.

2374
02:11:00,590 --> 02:11:03,859
He waltzes out of the bathroom and pisses it all over the joint.

2375
02:11:03,859 --> 02:11:04,500
Really?

2376
02:11:04,500 --> 02:11:05,859
Is this the actual hard part?

2377
02:11:06,979 --> 02:11:09,060
Sometimes you just gotta make him think you're crazy.

2378
02:11:09,060 --> 02:11:10,100
Yeah, pizza buddy raid.

2379
02:11:10,100 --> 02:11:10,659
That's right.

2380
02:11:10,659 --> 02:11:11,380
You got the moment.

2381
02:11:14,270 --> 02:11:15,390
Actual hard part?

2382
02:11:17,149 --> 02:11:17,470
You guys...

2383
02:11:17,470 --> 02:11:18,350
You can't...

2384
02:11:18,350 --> 02:11:19,149
Boy, who cried wolf.

2385
02:11:20,960 --> 02:11:22,079
First, it was the first part.

2386
02:11:22,079 --> 02:11:22,880
Oh, he's not gonna do it.

2387
02:11:22,880 --> 02:11:23,279
Second part.

2388
02:11:23,279 --> 02:11:23,920
Oh, it's impossible.

2389
02:11:23,920 --> 02:11:24,399
Third part.

2390
02:11:24,399 --> 02:11:24,960
It's impossible.

2391
02:11:27,859 --> 02:11:29,939
Stream chat that cried wolf.

2392
02:11:29,939 --> 02:11:30,260
I think.

2393
02:11:49,760 --> 02:11:50,399
He doesn't know.

2394
02:11:51,119 --> 02:11:52,239
Sing the raid song.

2395
02:11:58,720 --> 02:12:00,449
I don't have a raid song.

2396
02:12:01,329 --> 02:12:03,789
I have a follower song.

2397
02:12:04,510 --> 02:12:06,939
I don't know how it goes.

2398
02:12:17,739 --> 02:12:18,380
Fill the lyrics in.

2399
02:12:18,380 --> 02:12:19,100
You know how they go.

2400
02:12:19,899 --> 02:12:25,119
All right, so I have to just win the race.

2401
02:12:25,840 --> 02:12:28,670
But do I have to kill somebody in the race or what?

2402
02:12:39,310 --> 02:12:40,109
Just win.

2403
02:12:40,109 --> 02:12:40,350
Okay.

2404
02:12:41,739 --> 02:12:45,420
All right, if I hold it on the buzzer, do I get a boost like in Mario Kart?

2405
02:12:46,140 --> 02:12:49,840
Something's wrong with the car.

2406
02:12:50,560 --> 02:12:54,899
Just win the race.

2407
02:12:58,319 --> 02:13:04,289
I took that guy out.

2408
02:13:04,289 --> 02:13:05,729
That guy's not gonna race anymore.

2409
02:13:06,289 --> 02:13:10,340
It's crazy.

2410
02:13:10,340 --> 02:13:10,979
Okay, we're good.

2411
02:13:10,979 --> 02:13:11,300
We're good.

2412
02:13:11,300 --> 02:13:11,619
We're good.

2413
02:13:11,619 --> 02:13:12,579
We're good.

2414
02:13:12,579 --> 02:13:15,420
I got three laps to get to first place.

2415
02:13:16,140 --> 02:13:21,250
Shit.

2416
02:13:23,739 --> 02:13:24,859
Oh, it's too fast.

2417
02:13:24,859 --> 02:13:25,340
I see it.

2418
02:13:25,340 --> 02:13:26,220
Don't go that fast.

2419
02:13:33,949 --> 02:13:34,750
It's funny now.

2420
02:13:35,470 --> 02:13:39,630
But yeah, I'm probably going to be very, very agitated in about 10 minutes.

2421
02:13:40,189 --> 02:13:41,409
We're laughing now.

2422
02:13:41,409 --> 02:13:42,449
Oh, he hit the guy.

2423
02:13:43,409 --> 02:13:50,979
That funny moment is going to be a rage-inducing moment in about 15 minutes.

2424
02:13:50,979 --> 02:13:51,939
Just restart.

2425
02:13:51,939 --> 02:13:53,060
I've got this three laps.

2426
02:13:54,800 --> 02:13:55,359
I'm...

2427
02:13:55,359 --> 02:13:56,079
Look, I'm closing in.

2428
02:13:56,079 --> 02:13:56,479
I'm closing in.

2429
02:13:56,479 --> 02:13:56,960
I'm closing in.

2430
02:14:10,510 --> 02:14:10,909
Right?

2431
02:14:10,909 --> 02:14:11,310
That's...

2432
02:14:11,310 --> 02:14:12,430
Yeah, on my neck.

2433
02:14:12,430 --> 02:14:13,470
That would be very painful.

2434
02:14:13,470 --> 02:14:14,270
That would be horrible.

2435
02:14:21,199 --> 02:14:24,000
Nothing matters until the last 10 seconds of the race, guys.

2436
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:24,479
Don't you know?

2437
02:14:26,189 --> 02:14:29,149
I could be two miles away in last place.

2438
02:14:29,949 --> 02:14:32,350
As long as I just come in first, who cares?

2439
02:14:33,149 --> 02:14:43,739
I mean, I'm very far away right now.

2440
02:14:43,739 --> 02:14:44,850
I'm gonna get lapped.

2441
02:14:45,409 --> 02:14:48,380
Are the other drivers still on the course?

2442
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:02,560
Guys, yeah.

2443
02:15:02,560 --> 02:15:04,399
All I have to do is get a blue shell.

2444
02:15:04,399 --> 02:15:08,399
They give all the fucking losers back in 10th place blue shells.

2445
02:15:08,399 --> 02:15:08,960
I'll be fine.

2446
02:15:16,689 --> 02:15:17,649
Just restart.

2447
02:15:17,649 --> 02:15:18,210
Fine.

2448
02:15:18,210 --> 02:15:27,090
I need to get the cannon.

2449
02:15:27,090 --> 02:15:40,380
Yeah, the bullet bill where you just teleport through everybody.

2450
02:15:40,380 --> 02:15:41,260
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2451
02:15:41,260 --> 02:15:41,579
Skip.

2452
02:15:47,279 --> 02:15:49,140
One, two, three.

2453
02:15:55,039 --> 02:15:55,600
All right.

2454
02:15:55,600 --> 02:15:57,840
Just do it like every other racing game like this.

2455
02:15:57,840 --> 02:16:01,039
Just stay behind everybody and wait till there's a major crash.

2456
02:16:01,039 --> 02:16:03,760
And then just slowly go 10 miles per hour by everybody.

2457
02:16:04,479 --> 02:16:14,770
Hey, we're fine.

2458
02:16:14,770 --> 02:16:15,250
I'm still here.

2459
02:16:16,850 --> 02:16:17,970
Always pass on the inside.

2460
02:16:18,689 --> 02:16:28,960
Hey, I want to stay in like fifth to 10th place until the last 10 seconds.

2461
02:16:29,920 --> 02:16:31,039
I already have the strategy.

2462
02:16:31,039 --> 02:16:31,760
I already know what to do.

2463
02:16:32,479 --> 02:16:34,370
That guy's dead.

2464
02:16:34,370 --> 02:16:34,610
All right.

2465
02:16:34,610 --> 02:16:35,250
We got a crash.

2466
02:16:35,250 --> 02:16:35,809
We got a crash.

2467
02:16:36,530 --> 02:16:38,079
Easy.

2468
02:16:38,079 --> 02:16:38,639
10th place.

2469
02:16:39,280 --> 02:16:42,450
This is exactly where I want to be.

2470
02:16:50,190 --> 02:16:50,829
Good.

2471
02:16:50,829 --> 02:16:56,270
I don't want to be in first place.

2472
02:16:59,899 --> 02:17:09,040
That turn sucks.

2473
02:17:09,760 --> 02:17:18,239
It's not about going fast at all.

2474
02:17:19,040 --> 02:17:21,180
Just throwing.

2475
02:17:21,180 --> 02:17:22,459
Oh, I'm in ninth place.

2476
02:17:22,459 --> 02:17:23,420
I'm like halfway there.

2477
02:17:24,379 --> 02:17:31,010
All right.

2478
02:17:31,010 --> 02:17:31,809
Now punch it.

2479
02:17:31,809 --> 02:17:33,569
And then there's a huge that big turn here.

2480
02:17:33,569 --> 02:17:34,049
Okay, here we go.

2481
02:17:34,049 --> 02:17:35,489
We're going to lose two more people in front of us.

2482
02:17:36,209 --> 02:17:38,780
Oh, my God.

2483
02:17:38,780 --> 02:17:39,180
What do I do?

2484
02:17:39,899 --> 02:17:40,930
Oh, my God.

2485
02:17:40,930 --> 02:17:41,250
Oh, my God.

2486
02:17:41,250 --> 02:17:41,489
Oh, my God.

2487
02:17:41,489 --> 02:17:42,370
Oh, my God.

2488
02:17:42,370 --> 02:17:42,690
What?

2489
02:17:45,059 --> 02:17:49,540
My fucking God.

2490
02:17:49,540 --> 02:17:50,340
This is horrible.

2491
02:17:58,899 --> 02:17:59,459
Restart.

2492
02:17:59,459 --> 02:18:00,340
Not yet.

2493
02:18:00,340 --> 02:18:06,610
Once I know I once I can't see the car in front of me, I'll restart.

2494
02:18:13,469 --> 02:18:15,069
Does the fucking wheel even work?

2495
02:18:15,870 --> 02:18:18,510
I'm turning the car and I'm just going straight.

2496
02:18:19,309 --> 02:18:43,969
Yeah, it's a restart.

2497
02:18:43,969 --> 02:18:44,770
It has to be.

2498
02:18:44,770 --> 02:18:47,120
Holy shit.

2499
02:18:47,120 --> 02:18:47,840
This is ridiculous.

2500
02:18:47,840 --> 02:18:48,319
Okay, here we go.

2501
02:18:52,350 --> 02:18:52,750
New plan.

2502
02:18:53,709 --> 02:18:56,829
New plan is to cause a horrible, awful accident.

2503
02:18:57,549 --> 02:19:01,469
Just stuff myself into first place and just try to blow up like 10 of these cars.

2504
02:19:03,010 --> 02:19:03,729
Stay right here.

2505
02:19:03,729 --> 02:19:08,290
I'm going to just I'm going to just drive into the crowd like this, this group here.

2506
02:19:13,809 --> 02:19:18,879
Okay, well, it all did was take me out.

2507
02:19:19,520 --> 02:19:24,930
All right, I'm going to slow down.

2508
02:19:24,930 --> 02:19:29,059
That's unethical.

2509
02:19:29,059 --> 02:19:30,979
Well, I'm just trying to win.

2510
02:19:38,719 --> 02:19:39,680
Okay, I'm going to try.

2511
02:19:39,680 --> 02:19:40,879
I'm going to do very, very slow.

2512
02:19:41,600 --> 02:19:42,979
I have to drift and shit.

2513
02:19:43,780 --> 02:19:51,219
I don't have to start all the way back here.

2514
02:19:51,219 --> 02:19:52,020
That's so unfair.

2515
02:19:53,819 --> 02:19:54,940
I'm going to try some drifting.

2516
02:20:06,610 --> 02:20:07,569
Come on, stay with it.

2517
02:20:08,719 --> 02:20:10,719
These people are stopping in front of me.

2518
02:20:10,719 --> 02:20:12,639
They're actually holding their brakes down.

2519
02:20:28,100 --> 02:20:28,500
Dicks.

2520
02:20:33,250 --> 02:20:33,729
Okay.

2521
02:20:33,729 --> 02:20:34,850
All right, I'm going to be in 12.

2522
02:20:37,409 --> 02:20:38,690
Holy shit, we dodged that one.

2523
02:20:50,670 --> 02:20:52,110
Oh, most lost control.

2524
02:21:03,950 --> 02:21:05,549
Go with the crash, go with the crash, go with the crash.

2525
02:21:06,190 --> 02:21:25,200
I'm not in last place.

2526
02:21:25,200 --> 02:21:26,000
I'm in 14th.

2527
02:21:26,719 --> 02:21:37,250
Two people are dead.

2528
02:21:38,430 --> 02:21:54,909
So, how the fuck do you take this turn?

2529
02:21:55,709 --> 02:22:09,149
Use the brakes.

2530
02:22:10,110 --> 02:22:12,459
You can't use the gun.

2531
02:22:12,459 --> 02:22:13,180
I don't have a gun.

2532
02:22:13,180 --> 02:22:13,979
What are you talking about?

2533
02:22:14,540 --> 02:22:21,420
I'm going to go left side.

2534
02:22:21,979 --> 02:22:26,110
I'm going to go left side.

2535
02:22:26,110 --> 02:22:27,790
I'm going to try to pass everybody on the left.

2536
02:22:32,799 --> 02:22:34,479
I'm going to try to stay somewhere around 80.

2537
02:22:40,270 --> 02:22:42,270
Why is my car covered in fucking cooking oil?

2538
02:22:42,270 --> 02:22:43,629
Like, I don't, why can I, I don't understand.

2539
02:22:44,430 --> 02:22:45,629
What the fuck?

2540
02:22:45,629 --> 02:22:49,520
I was going slow.

2541
02:22:49,520 --> 02:22:50,479
The thing just spun out.

2542
02:23:06,459 --> 02:23:07,500
Bad traction.

2543
02:23:07,500 --> 02:23:08,780
Well, they have bad traction too.

2544
02:23:08,780 --> 02:23:09,260
It's not fair.

2545
02:23:10,219 --> 02:23:16,739
All right.

2546
02:23:16,739 --> 02:23:17,379
Let's try this again.

2547
02:23:17,379 --> 02:23:18,979
I was in like ninth or eighth place.

2548
02:23:18,979 --> 02:23:19,860
We're going to improve here.

2549
02:23:21,059 --> 02:23:22,340
This big turn is stupid.

2550
02:23:22,979 --> 02:23:24,879
And it gets rid of all the newbie players.

2551
02:23:40,260 --> 02:23:51,100
Slow down, omega low.

2552
02:23:51,100 --> 02:23:52,780
How fast do you think I was going right there?

2553
02:23:52,780 --> 02:23:55,739
I was going like 25 miles per hour.

2554
02:24:01,940 --> 02:24:02,819
We warned you.

2555
02:24:07,870 --> 02:24:10,270
So, is this one of those scenarios where this game,

2556
02:24:10,270 --> 02:24:12,430
when it was returned to Blockbuster was,

2557
02:24:12,430 --> 02:24:14,510
you know when you would buy a game or rent a game at Blockbuster,

2558
02:24:14,510 --> 02:24:15,950
it would have like a save file on it?

2559
02:24:16,750 --> 02:24:18,510
Was it just always on this save file?

2560
02:24:19,389 --> 02:24:20,670
You got to be fucking kidding me.

2561
02:24:20,670 --> 02:24:21,469
It's all right, it's all right, it's all right.

2562
02:24:21,469 --> 02:24:22,190
I got it, I got it, I got it.

2563
02:24:47,819 --> 02:24:48,700
Lightning McQueen?

2564
02:24:57,090 --> 02:24:58,930
Why, we're going to do the same thing as that guy.

2565
02:25:05,709 --> 02:25:06,110
Okay.

2566
02:25:06,110 --> 02:25:06,590
Hold on.

2567
02:25:06,590 --> 02:25:07,469
Let me see the mini map.

2568
02:25:07,469 --> 02:25:08,350
Can I see anybody yet?

2569
02:25:18,620 --> 02:25:19,340
Holy shit.

2570
02:25:19,340 --> 02:25:20,139
This is horrible.

2571
02:25:24,540 --> 02:25:25,979
This is what you guys are talking about.

2572
02:25:31,409 --> 02:25:32,129
Now he gets it.

2573
02:25:34,909 --> 02:25:36,270
Three laps, two.

2574
02:25:36,270 --> 02:25:37,709
What were they, why?

2575
02:25:37,709 --> 02:25:38,510
Why not just one?

2576
02:25:39,309 --> 02:25:40,670
Why do I have to do three of these?

2577
02:25:41,389 --> 02:25:43,950
Don't hold the gas down.

2578
02:25:43,950 --> 02:25:44,590
I'm not.

2579
02:25:44,829 --> 02:25:45,629
I'm being gentle.

2580
02:26:04,989 --> 02:26:06,430
Okay, we're good, kind of.

2581
02:26:08,620 --> 02:26:09,659
I guess, kind of.

2582
02:26:14,459 --> 02:26:16,299
That was very gentle, but I'm in last place.

2583
02:26:17,020 --> 02:26:22,860
Look, as long as I can see everybody, I don't even care.

2584
02:26:23,500 --> 02:26:29,540
All right, this guy is erratically driving.

2585
02:26:30,100 --> 02:26:37,340
I'm going a little too fast, but it's all right.

2586
02:26:37,340 --> 02:26:38,059
I'm just going to gain some ground.

2587
02:26:38,059 --> 02:26:39,100
I'm going to slow down right here.

2588
02:26:39,100 --> 02:26:40,700
Just coast, coast, coast, coast, coast, coast.

2589
02:26:41,420 --> 02:26:46,559
Come on, you guys are filling up the road.

2590
02:26:46,559 --> 02:26:47,120
Pass on the left.

2591
02:26:47,760 --> 02:26:50,030
Okay, slow.

2592
02:26:52,500 --> 02:26:53,059
Good.

2593
02:26:53,059 --> 02:26:54,500
All right, we're good, we're good, we're good, we're good, we're good, we're good, we're good.

2594
02:26:54,500 --> 02:26:55,219
Slow, slow, slow, slow, slow.

2595
02:26:55,219 --> 02:26:55,780
Get out of my way.

2596
02:26:57,059 --> 02:26:57,940
He's connected to me.

2597
02:26:57,940 --> 02:26:58,739
He's connected to me.

2598
02:26:58,739 --> 02:26:59,860
You fucking connected to me.

2599
02:27:01,709 --> 02:27:04,430
That guy latched tires onto me and told me.

2600
02:27:05,229 --> 02:27:22,500
Hooked my tire with his tire.

2601
02:27:22,500 --> 02:27:23,860
That was better than the last attempt, though.

2602
02:27:23,860 --> 02:27:24,739
That was better than the last time.

2603
02:27:25,459 --> 02:27:30,180
He got stream sniped.

2604
02:27:32,020 --> 02:27:43,549
All right, here comes the famous difficult turn where every single AI can do it,

2605
02:27:43,549 --> 02:27:46,030
except for the one guy in the back who's the computer or non-computer player.

2606
02:27:46,750 --> 02:27:52,639
Nobody else has any trouble with that at all,

2607
02:27:52,639 --> 02:27:54,639
except for the one guy actually playing the fucking video game.

2608
02:27:56,959 --> 02:27:57,360
Famous.

2609
02:27:58,079 --> 02:28:14,770
All right, stay on the left side here.

2610
02:28:14,770 --> 02:28:16,450
Don't hook on to somebody.

2611
02:28:17,729 --> 02:28:19,600
We're okay.

2612
02:28:20,159 --> 02:28:23,200
All right, I'm doing way better than I was the last few times.

2613
02:28:24,670 --> 02:28:25,309
That's certain.

2614
02:28:26,500 --> 02:28:26,979
Slow down.

2615
02:28:31,629 --> 02:28:32,270
Get off of me.

2616
02:28:32,909 --> 02:28:33,389
Same guy.

2617
02:28:34,110 --> 02:28:44,739
Okay, that's always been the wall.

2618
02:28:45,379 --> 02:28:51,569
Still not in a bad spot.

2619
02:28:51,569 --> 02:29:00,690
Let's do this turn good.

2620
02:29:07,469 --> 02:29:07,709
Really?

2621
02:29:12,899 --> 02:29:14,500
Why are you guys all going so fast?

2622
02:29:15,139 --> 02:29:20,000
I think I'm the famous turn again.

2623
02:29:20,000 --> 02:29:20,799
All right, there's lap two.

2624
02:29:20,799 --> 02:29:22,000
I didn't crash yet.

2625
02:29:22,000 --> 02:29:22,479
That's good.

2626
02:29:23,120 --> 02:29:25,459
Jesus.

2627
02:29:31,139 --> 02:29:33,760
Dude, what the fuck is this mission?

2628
02:29:34,319 --> 02:29:35,120
What the hell?

2629
02:29:35,920 --> 02:29:44,370
Lower the difficulty?

2630
02:29:44,370 --> 02:29:45,569
How would that change the driving?

2631
02:29:55,090 --> 02:29:56,209
It's worse AI?

2632
02:29:57,170 --> 02:29:59,500
It actually is worse AI.

2633
02:30:00,219 --> 02:30:01,819
Classic is hard driving.

2634
02:30:02,540 --> 02:30:07,840
I'm going burger boy technique.

2635
02:30:07,840 --> 02:30:08,799
No, fuck all these tech.

2636
02:30:08,799 --> 02:30:10,319
No, screw every one of these.

2637
02:30:10,959 --> 02:30:12,000
These things you guys telling me.

2638
02:30:12,000 --> 02:30:13,040
Follow on burger boy technique.

2639
02:30:13,040 --> 02:30:13,360
Let's go.

2640
02:30:21,329 --> 02:30:27,780
The burger boy technique is you just don't give a shit.

2641
02:30:28,420 --> 02:30:47,909
Shit.

2642
02:30:48,530 --> 02:30:54,940
Here we go.

2643
02:30:54,940 --> 02:30:55,420
Right through.

2644
02:30:56,219 --> 02:30:56,620
12th.

2645
02:30:57,500 --> 02:30:57,899
11th.

2646
02:31:05,600 --> 02:31:06,799
Okay, we're fine, fine, fine, fine, fine.

2647
02:31:06,799 --> 02:31:07,680
Yeah, full, full throttle.

2648
02:31:07,680 --> 02:31:10,319
Throttle, throttle, throttle, throttle, throttle, throttle, throttle, throttle, throttle, throttle.

2649
02:31:10,319 --> 02:31:11,569
Watch out for this jump.

2650
02:31:22,059 --> 02:31:32,579
All right, we're still a fine.

2651
02:31:32,579 --> 02:31:33,139
This is all right.

2652
02:31:33,780 --> 02:31:34,719
Could be worse.

2653
02:31:35,280 --> 02:31:47,600
Let's follow the other drivers.

2654
02:31:52,379 --> 02:31:52,940
Too fast.

2655
02:31:52,940 --> 02:31:53,819
Way too fast.

2656
02:31:54,379 --> 02:31:55,659
Pull it back.

2657
02:31:55,659 --> 02:31:58,989
Of course, look at how fast that guy's going.

2658
02:31:58,989 --> 02:31:59,709
No matter to him.

2659
02:32:00,350 --> 02:32:03,719
Nice.

2660
02:32:12,659 --> 02:32:15,250
How many people uninstalled the game at this point?

2661
02:32:15,250 --> 02:32:16,290
You remade the game.

2662
02:32:16,850 --> 02:32:23,079
Hey, let's remake the game and make sure we get to a point where everybody fucking uninstalls it.

2663
02:32:23,959 --> 02:32:26,600
You don't see the next 14 hours of the story.

2664
02:32:36,309 --> 02:32:37,829
Being filtered.

2665
02:32:37,829 --> 02:32:39,110
Yeah, well, what the fuck?

2666
02:32:40,389 --> 02:32:41,829
I'm not lowering the difficulty yet.

2667
02:32:41,829 --> 02:32:42,329
Not yet.

2668
02:32:43,030 --> 02:32:50,719
That was an anger bump.

2669
02:32:55,489 --> 02:32:57,010
Yeah, get the fuck out of my way.

2670
02:32:57,649 --> 02:32:58,450
Get out of my way.

2671
02:32:59,090 --> 02:33:02,479
Put this hay here.

2672
02:33:19,440 --> 02:33:20,879
I'm never going to get to fifth place.

2673
02:33:23,319 --> 02:33:26,360
I need like a TAS to be able to complete this mission.

2674
02:33:26,920 --> 02:34:04,370
I tried driving on the road.

2675
02:34:05,170 --> 02:34:05,809
Yeah, I have.

2676
02:34:16,819 --> 02:34:18,260
Dude, what the fuck?

2677
02:34:18,899 --> 02:34:19,299
Why?

2678
02:34:19,940 --> 02:34:22,180
Look at how much acceleration.

2679
02:34:22,180 --> 02:34:24,180
That guy went 5,000 miles.

2680
02:34:24,180 --> 02:34:24,739
Look at him.

2681
02:34:24,739 --> 02:34:25,940
I'm holding R.

2682
02:34:25,940 --> 02:34:27,139
I'm holding down right trigger.

2683
02:34:27,860 --> 02:34:28,739
That guy has...

2684
02:34:28,739 --> 02:34:30,420
He's going 10 times faster than me.

2685
02:34:41,040 --> 02:34:41,840
Ride the bank.

2686
02:34:53,280 --> 02:34:54,719
You tried going as fast as you can.

2687
02:34:54,719 --> 02:34:58,239
Yeah, your car spins around in a circle and every other AI driver

2688
02:34:58,239 --> 02:35:00,079
drives 500 miles per hour.

2689
02:35:00,559 --> 02:35:07,760
I'm the only one that has to drive the car.

2690
02:35:08,479 --> 02:35:24,239
Okay, at least one idiot I get to pass.

2691
02:35:24,959 --> 02:35:29,600
Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.

2692
02:35:29,600 --> 02:35:31,040
We got a full idiot pile up here.

2693
02:35:49,030 --> 02:35:50,629
Easy, don't rip the wheel.

2694
02:35:50,629 --> 02:35:58,790
Look, there he goes.

2695
02:36:15,489 --> 02:36:17,010
Ride the wall.

2696
02:36:17,010 --> 02:36:39,239
I don't care.

2697
02:36:39,799 --> 02:36:43,879
I'm not going to sit here for five hours.

2698
02:36:43,879 --> 02:36:45,079
I don't give a shit.

2699
02:36:45,079 --> 02:36:46,739
I don't care.

2700
02:36:46,739 --> 02:36:47,299
I'm just going to beat it.

2701
02:36:47,299 --> 02:36:48,420
I'm just going to play the game.

2702
02:36:48,420 --> 02:36:50,739
What, I have to do the driving mission for four hours?

2703
02:36:50,739 --> 02:36:57,799
If you can beat the Simpsons hit and run.

2704
02:36:57,799 --> 02:37:00,200
Simpsons run at least had a car that made sense when you drove it.

2705
02:37:00,840 --> 02:37:05,430
And I know, oh, it's an old car.

2706
02:37:06,229 --> 02:37:07,239
Yeah, whatever.

2707
02:37:07,959 --> 02:37:11,559
I'm going to blow by these fucking assholes on easy.

2708
02:37:12,360 --> 02:37:17,219
This is grandma difficulty.

2709
02:37:17,860 --> 02:37:38,819
Get out of the way.

2710
02:37:52,149 --> 02:37:54,069
I don't care.

2711
02:37:54,069 --> 02:37:54,790
I don't care.

2712
02:37:54,790 --> 02:37:56,149
You can call me terrible.

2713
02:37:56,149 --> 02:37:57,829
You can call me shitty all you want.

2714
02:37:58,549 --> 02:38:01,190
I'm going to get in first place on easy.

2715
02:38:01,190 --> 02:38:02,870
Hand the controller to your mother game.

2716
02:38:04,870 --> 02:38:06,069
Even this is still hard.

2717
02:38:07,270 --> 02:38:07,989
Oh shit.

2718
02:38:09,030 --> 02:38:10,979
I can't lose on easy.

2719
02:38:10,979 --> 02:38:11,940
I got to first try it on easy.

2720
02:38:11,940 --> 02:38:13,379
Otherwise, I have to delete my Twitch account.

2721
02:38:28,290 --> 02:38:28,850
Get off me.

2722
02:38:28,850 --> 02:38:50,420
Get off of me.

2723
02:38:50,420 --> 02:38:51,459
Bank, bank, bank, bank.

2724
02:38:51,459 --> 02:38:52,579
I don't need to bank anything.

2725
02:38:52,579 --> 02:38:54,739
This is to win.

2726
02:39:03,329 --> 02:39:04,549
I know, I'm trying to kill that guy.

2727
02:39:05,670 --> 02:39:06,149
That's a threat.

2728
02:39:06,149 --> 02:39:07,110
That's the guy in second place.

2729
02:39:07,829 --> 02:39:17,399
I don't care.

2730
02:39:17,399 --> 02:39:18,200
I don't care.

2731
02:39:18,200 --> 02:39:21,399
I know people are going to be making fun of me for years over this.

2732
02:39:21,399 --> 02:39:21,799
Who cares?

2733
02:39:30,260 --> 02:39:30,899
Use the bank.

2734
02:39:31,459 --> 02:39:32,819
Guys, I don't even know what that means.

2735
02:39:33,780 --> 02:39:35,059
When I hear you say that, all I know to think about

2736
02:39:35,059 --> 02:39:36,340
is like withdrawing money from an ATM.

2737
02:39:36,340 --> 02:39:36,979
I don't know.

2738
02:39:36,979 --> 02:39:37,700
Use the bank.

2739
02:39:37,700 --> 02:39:38,899
I don't even know what that means.

2740
02:39:38,899 --> 02:39:39,299
I'm going to win.

2741
02:39:39,299 --> 02:39:39,860
I'm in first place.

2742
02:39:39,860 --> 02:39:40,500
I'm doing fine.

2743
02:39:41,299 --> 02:39:59,170
I don't tip over.

2744
02:39:59,170 --> 02:39:59,649
Okay, I'm fine.

2745
02:40:04,819 --> 02:40:06,579
I'm embarrassed for him.

2746
02:40:06,579 --> 02:40:07,459
No, you're not.

2747
02:40:07,459 --> 02:40:07,940
It's fine.

2748
02:40:07,940 --> 02:40:08,420
Whatever.

2749
02:40:08,420 --> 02:40:08,739
What do you...

2750
02:40:08,739 --> 02:40:09,459
What does it matter?

2751
02:40:12,479 --> 02:40:12,639
What?

2752
02:40:12,639 --> 02:40:13,040
Everyone...

2753
02:40:13,040 --> 02:40:14,159
You know, your resident sleep...

2754
02:40:14,159 --> 02:40:15,440
Fine, I'll put it on classic mode again.

2755
02:40:16,239 --> 02:40:17,120
I can't lose my Twitch account.

2756
02:40:17,120 --> 02:40:18,319
It's going to get fucking deleted if I don't win.

2757
02:40:21,270 --> 02:40:32,979
I set for a bank.

2758
02:40:43,170 --> 02:40:47,649
Come on, this guy's smoking.

2759
02:40:53,270 --> 02:40:53,909
Okay, I'm good.

2760
02:40:53,909 --> 02:40:54,469
I'm good.

2761
02:40:54,469 --> 02:40:55,030
I'm good.

2762
02:40:55,030 --> 02:40:55,270
I'm good.

2763
02:40:55,270 --> 02:40:55,510
I'm good.

2764
02:40:55,510 --> 02:41:07,329
I'm good.

2765
02:41:07,329 --> 02:41:08,850
How embarrassing.

2766
02:41:08,850 --> 02:41:10,610
Get those resident sleepers out of here.

2767
02:41:10,610 --> 02:41:12,209
Get those resident sleepers out of here.

2768
02:41:12,209 --> 02:41:13,250
I don't want to see them.

2769
02:41:18,340 --> 02:41:19,620
Get the resident sleepers out of here.

2770
02:41:20,180 --> 02:41:21,559
Fine.

2771
02:41:21,559 --> 02:41:22,600
You want me to turn it on classic?

2772
02:41:23,239 --> 02:41:25,170
Where's the end of the match?

2773
02:41:25,889 --> 02:41:30,200
All right, fine.

2774
02:41:30,200 --> 02:41:31,399
Let me just get to this next turn

2775
02:41:31,399 --> 02:41:32,440
and I'll put it on classic mode.

2776
02:41:33,000 --> 02:41:35,920
Where's the finish...

2777
02:41:35,920 --> 02:41:36,559
Where's the finish line?

2778
02:41:37,200 --> 02:41:57,920
Do it now.

2779
02:41:57,920 --> 02:41:58,799
Not yet.

2780
02:41:58,799 --> 02:42:00,790
After I ride the bank, I will...

2781
02:42:01,590 --> 02:42:02,950
This is all the sleepers.

2782
02:42:04,069 --> 02:42:04,709
Fuck, man.

2783
02:42:07,510 --> 02:42:08,229
What the fuck?

2784
02:42:08,229 --> 02:42:08,629
Come on.

2785
02:42:08,629 --> 02:42:09,590
I don't want to...

2786
02:42:09,590 --> 02:42:10,229
That's all right.

2787
02:42:13,280 --> 02:42:14,639
Look, I'll beat it on classic.

2788
02:42:14,639 --> 02:42:15,360
How does that sound?

2789
02:42:28,399 --> 02:42:29,440
All right, we did it.

2790
02:42:36,709 --> 02:42:37,909
I'm getting booed, but I won.

2791
02:42:38,469 --> 02:42:39,510
I'll take the booze.

2792
02:42:54,020 --> 02:42:55,379
Think you underestimate

2793
02:42:55,379 --> 02:42:56,819
how much patience I have for that.

2794
02:43:00,819 --> 02:43:02,020
Relapse on classic mode?

2795
02:43:02,020 --> 02:43:02,659
No fucking way.

2796
02:43:03,940 --> 02:43:04,739
Stream would turn off.

2797
02:43:19,200 --> 02:43:19,520
Oh shit.

2798
02:43:19,520 --> 02:43:21,440
This is the most spam

2799
02:43:21,440 --> 02:43:22,639
I've ever seen on my channel.

2800
02:43:24,000 --> 02:43:24,719
Holy shit.

2801
02:43:24,719 --> 02:43:26,719
It's every single person doing this.

2802
02:43:26,719 --> 02:43:27,840
Every single one of you is doing this.

2803
02:43:28,479 --> 02:43:29,120
Holy shit.

2804
02:43:30,959 --> 02:43:32,450
I must mean it's true.

2805
02:43:48,260 --> 02:43:49,639
No, no, no.

2806
02:43:50,040 --> 02:43:51,719
Take off emote only mode,

2807
02:43:51,719 --> 02:43:53,000
and I want everyone to spam that.

2808
02:43:53,000 --> 02:43:54,360
I want you to break my chat.

2809
02:43:56,799 --> 02:43:58,479
There was 10,000 people there.

2810
02:43:58,479 --> 02:43:59,120
I deserve it.

2811
02:44:14,239 --> 02:44:15,360
Hey, remember when we said that?

2812
02:44:16,639 --> 02:44:17,280
What it would look like

2813
02:44:17,280 --> 02:44:18,639
if you had bots in your channel?

2814
02:44:20,340 --> 02:44:21,620
This is it right here.

2815
02:44:28,100 --> 02:44:29,219
Now I can just play the game.

2816
02:44:29,219 --> 02:44:30,739
Well, I just want to play the game.

2817
02:44:31,379 --> 02:44:34,840
I just want to experience the story.

2818
02:44:40,280 --> 02:44:41,079
Whoa, did you say

2819
02:44:41,079 --> 02:44:42,360
you just put it on easy, Tommy?

2820
02:44:42,920 --> 02:44:45,959
I wasn't paying that much attention.

2821
02:45:02,579 --> 02:45:03,139
No more.

2822
02:45:03,139 --> 02:45:04,020
I'm done.

2823
02:45:04,020 --> 02:45:04,979
I don't want to see it anymore.

2824
02:45:04,979 --> 02:45:05,459
No more.

2825
02:45:08,149 --> 02:45:08,469
Okay.

2826
02:45:08,469 --> 02:45:08,950
No more.

2827
02:45:09,909 --> 02:45:13,110
Put it into cool guy mode.

2828
02:45:13,110 --> 02:45:13,510
Put it in.

2829
02:45:13,510 --> 02:45:13,989
All right.

2830
02:45:13,989 --> 02:45:14,629
No more of that.

2831
02:45:15,889 --> 02:45:17,170
Making me feel self-conscious.

2832
02:45:17,809 --> 02:45:19,260
Yeah.

2833
02:45:22,200 --> 02:45:23,879
I'm feeling a little self-conscious right now.

2834
02:45:24,440 --> 02:45:26,559
Where's Polly?

2835
02:45:26,559 --> 02:45:37,440
Here's the funny part.

2836
02:45:37,440 --> 02:45:38,479
The people that come into the stream

2837
02:45:38,479 --> 02:45:40,079
that see that I've only been streaming for a few hours

2838
02:45:40,079 --> 02:45:40,479
are going to be like,

2839
02:45:40,479 --> 02:45:42,799
holy shit, he beat that mission in like an hour or so.

2840
02:45:42,799 --> 02:45:43,280
Pretty good.

2841
02:45:43,280 --> 02:45:43,680
Top tier.

2842
02:45:48,659 --> 02:45:49,159
What?

2843
02:45:52,319 --> 02:45:52,819
Polly.

2844
02:45:53,760 --> 02:45:54,799
Looking for Polly.

2845
02:45:58,040 --> 02:45:59,399
Yeah, I'm realizing right now

2846
02:45:59,399 --> 02:46:01,399
I just did the unforgivable sin.

2847
02:46:03,799 --> 02:46:04,840
I made it.

2848
02:46:04,840 --> 02:46:06,360
I put the game on easy.

2849
02:46:07,809 --> 02:46:08,850
On stream.

2850
02:46:08,850 --> 02:46:09,969
On Twitch.

2851
02:46:09,969 --> 02:46:12,370
That was very bad.

2852
02:46:12,370 --> 02:46:13,409
I never should have done that.

2853
02:46:14,719 --> 02:46:15,219
Yep.

2854
02:46:15,600 --> 02:46:20,719
Polly, where the fuck are you?

2855
02:46:21,360 --> 02:46:27,219
I could have put it on normal

2856
02:46:27,860 --> 02:46:29,219
and got away with it probably

2857
02:46:29,219 --> 02:46:31,459
with enough explaining and enough gas lighting.

2858
02:46:32,260 --> 02:46:32,819
Easy though.

2859
02:46:33,620 --> 02:46:34,120
No.

2860
02:46:34,840 --> 02:46:35,719
It's going to be about a year

2861
02:46:35,719 --> 02:46:37,159
before you guys get over that one.

2862
02:46:40,850 --> 02:46:41,350
Polly.

2863
02:46:44,290 --> 02:46:44,790
Polly.

2864
02:46:45,250 --> 02:46:49,520
I don't know what Polly looks like.

2865
02:46:49,520 --> 02:46:56,389
I felt like I was holding a microwave.

2866
02:47:09,479 --> 02:47:10,120
All right.

2867
02:47:10,120 --> 02:47:10,440
All right.

2868
02:47:10,440 --> 02:47:10,760
All right.

2869
02:47:10,760 --> 02:47:13,000
Let's continue our playthrough of Mafia.

2870
02:47:16,559 --> 02:47:17,200
There's Polly.

2871
02:47:17,200 --> 02:47:17,700
Hey, Polly.

2872
02:47:23,360 --> 02:47:23,860
Eat.

2873
02:47:24,159 --> 02:47:25,440
Okay, he's going to eat.

2874
02:47:25,440 --> 02:47:26,639
There's the cafeteria over here.

2875
02:47:27,200 --> 02:47:44,770
Probably right here.

2876
02:47:44,770 --> 02:47:45,270
Polly?

2877
02:47:46,159 --> 02:47:46,959
Eating?

2878
02:47:46,959 --> 02:47:47,459
Somewhere?

2879
02:47:51,250 --> 02:47:53,170
I think I might put it on easy to find him.

2880
02:47:53,809 --> 02:47:55,780
Yeah, he'll probably show me

2881
02:47:55,780 --> 02:47:57,299
an indicator on the map where he is.

2882
02:47:57,299 --> 02:47:57,940
Not a bad idea.

2883
02:48:06,280 --> 02:48:06,780
Polly?

2884
02:48:06,780 --> 02:48:07,559
Where the hell is he?

2885
02:48:08,120 --> 02:48:10,069
There he is.

2886
02:48:11,590 --> 02:48:12,090
Polly.

2887
02:48:14,600 --> 02:48:15,559
God damn it, man.

2888
02:48:16,440 --> 02:48:18,799
Why aren't you Polly?

2889
02:48:18,799 --> 02:48:19,680
For the love of God.

2890
02:48:20,399 --> 02:48:23,190
It's as if he was eating.

2891
02:48:23,750 --> 02:48:28,450
He's the guy that looks like Jimmy Fallon.

2892
02:48:30,920 --> 02:48:32,520
They all look like Jimmy Fallon.

2893
02:48:45,079 --> 02:48:46,680
It's just Jimmy Fallon everywhere.

2894
02:49:05,030 --> 02:49:05,530
Polly?

2895
02:49:12,229 --> 02:49:15,920
You look like Jimmy Fallon.

2896
02:49:15,920 --> 02:49:17,280
Everybody looks like Jimmy Fallon.

2897
02:49:23,010 --> 02:49:23,489
Oh, of course.

2898
02:49:23,489 --> 02:49:25,569
He's the guy all the way at the edge of the map lying down.

2899
02:49:40,389 --> 02:49:41,670
This is show some respect.

2900
02:49:41,670 --> 02:49:42,709
Jimmy Fallon?

2901
02:49:42,709 --> 02:49:43,350
That's true.

2902
02:49:43,350 --> 02:49:45,510
But I'm saying you gotta go home too.

2903
02:49:45,510 --> 02:49:47,190
He does look like Jimmy Fallon.

2904
02:49:49,120 --> 02:49:49,840
Okay then.

2905
02:49:50,559 --> 02:49:51,299
I guess.

2906
02:49:54,309 --> 02:49:56,559
Let's go, Jim.

2907
02:49:57,680 --> 02:50:03,879
He's about as funny as Jimmy Fallon.

2908
02:50:09,829 --> 02:50:11,190
You know, I haven't seen Jimmy Fallon

2909
02:50:12,239 --> 02:50:14,719
do anything in, I don't know,

2910
02:50:14,719 --> 02:50:15,920
probably seven or eight years.

2911
02:50:25,250 --> 02:50:27,409
He says he hosts the Tonight Show or something, right?

2912
02:50:32,440 --> 02:50:33,719
You know what I said?

2913
02:50:33,719 --> 02:50:36,159
What did you say, Polly?

2914
02:50:36,159 --> 02:50:38,360
I said this guy.

2915
02:50:38,360 --> 02:50:39,000
Oh, no, no, no.

2916
02:50:39,000 --> 02:50:39,479
That's not true.

2917
02:50:40,120 --> 02:50:42,280
I ate his Ben and Jerry's ice cream.

2918
02:50:43,799 --> 02:50:45,479
Yeah, that was like probably a year ago.

2919
02:50:45,479 --> 02:50:47,959
So I have consumed Jimmy Fallon content.

2920
02:50:52,530 --> 02:50:53,329
By the way, it sucks.

2921
02:50:54,049 --> 02:50:56,079
It's really not that good.

2922
02:51:00,979 --> 02:51:04,930
Half-baked best Ben and Jerry's ice cream.

2923
02:51:04,930 --> 02:51:06,290
You don't even need a celebrity on that one.

2924
02:51:10,180 --> 02:51:11,459
Or Chunky Monkey.

2925
02:51:11,459 --> 02:51:11,940
Get out of here.

2926
02:51:11,940 --> 02:51:12,440
What do you mean?

2927
02:51:20,120 --> 02:51:21,159
I love Chunky Monkey.

2928
02:51:21,159 --> 02:51:21,659
He's the best.

2929
02:51:25,409 --> 02:51:27,010
Chunky Monkey without the walnuts

2930
02:51:27,010 --> 02:51:28,290
would be the best ice cream ever made.

2931
02:51:39,200 --> 02:51:40,559
I don't like nuts and ice cream, really.

2932
02:51:41,520 --> 02:51:42,879
I love pistachio ice cream,

2933
02:51:42,879 --> 02:51:45,600
but I don't like the pistachios in the ice cream.

2934
02:51:45,600 --> 02:51:48,079
I just like the pistachio-flavored green ice cream.

2935
02:51:49,440 --> 02:51:51,239
Kind of getting in the way.

2936
02:51:51,239 --> 02:51:52,600
I usually just go around them.

2937
02:51:59,379 --> 02:52:00,020
What happened?

2938
02:52:02,420 --> 02:52:04,979
What am I doing?

2939
02:52:22,739 --> 02:52:23,219
Fish food.

2940
02:52:23,219 --> 02:52:24,100
Yeah, fish food's pretty good.

2941
02:52:24,819 --> 02:52:27,219
Take me to the blue tropics.

2942
02:52:27,219 --> 02:52:29,940
I didn't take you home.

2943
02:52:29,940 --> 02:52:30,760
The bridge.

2944
02:52:31,719 --> 02:52:33,719
Take the bridge over to the island.

2945
02:52:34,360 --> 02:52:35,559
Take me to the ladies.

2946
02:52:36,680 --> 02:52:38,280
Pauly, get out of the car, please.

2947
02:52:38,280 --> 02:52:39,399
Go lie down for a few hours.

2948
02:52:55,239 --> 02:52:56,440
Way to drive in movie.

2949
02:52:56,440 --> 02:52:57,799
Get the fuck out of the car, Pauly.

2950
02:53:03,239 --> 02:53:04,520
I feel so good.

2951
02:53:04,520 --> 02:53:09,110
After complete.

2952
02:53:13,920 --> 02:53:15,120
We had some subs, by the way.

2953
02:53:15,120 --> 02:53:18,079
We had Nepsi gave five community subs.

2954
02:53:18,079 --> 02:53:21,620
Chungy, Chungy Scrungey gave five,

2955
02:53:22,260 --> 02:53:24,340
and then Malcolm X2 gave five as well.

2956
02:53:24,340 --> 02:53:25,459
Let's go, Tom.

2957
02:53:25,459 --> 02:53:26,260
You want anything else?

2958
02:53:26,260 --> 02:53:31,159
No, I'm heading home.

2959
02:53:31,159 --> 02:53:33,559
Hey, Tom, before you go,

2960
02:53:34,200 --> 02:53:36,549
I ask you maybe a small favor.

2961
02:53:37,350 --> 02:53:38,290
Sure, Luigi.

2962
02:53:38,290 --> 02:53:38,930
What do you need?

2963
02:53:38,930 --> 02:53:40,370
Zombie Eater, $50.

2964
02:53:40,370 --> 02:53:41,649
5,000 fucking bits.

2965
02:53:42,450 --> 02:53:43,010
Sarah.

2966
02:53:43,010 --> 02:53:44,049
Thank you, Zombie Eater.

2967
02:53:44,049 --> 02:53:44,530
Yeah, I hear it.

2968
02:53:44,530 --> 02:53:45,489
She doesn't need any kind of-

2969
02:53:45,489 --> 02:53:46,129
Huge money.

2970
02:53:48,479 --> 02:53:49,680
You owe us a chubby bunny,

2971
02:53:49,680 --> 02:53:50,959
but seeing as that you committed the card,

2972
02:53:50,959 --> 02:53:53,920
I'll set up changing the game's difficulty to easy on stream.

2973
02:53:54,639 --> 02:53:55,840
Don't you think we deserve something else?

2974
02:54:01,040 --> 02:54:01,760
Maybe.

2975
02:54:01,760 --> 02:54:02,479
I'll think about that.

2976
02:54:10,340 --> 02:54:10,979
I gotta piss.

2977
02:54:11,780 --> 02:54:13,059
Watch the cut scene and relax.

2978
02:54:13,059 --> 02:54:13,780
I'll be right back.

2979
02:54:19,120 --> 02:54:21,280
Luigi, I'd be honored.

2980
02:54:25,670 --> 02:54:27,430
Sarah, time to close.

2981
02:54:35,799 --> 02:54:36,840
What's this then?

2982
02:54:39,459 --> 02:54:40,420
Tom is...

2983
02:54:40,420 --> 02:54:41,299
Tom's gonna take you.

2984
02:54:42,959 --> 02:54:43,440
They're right.

2985
02:54:44,319 --> 02:54:45,920
Hey, I just work here.

2986
02:54:46,639 --> 02:54:47,840
Make sure nobody bother you.

2987
02:54:50,280 --> 02:54:51,079
Fine.

2988
02:54:51,079 --> 02:54:52,520
If it'll make you feel better, Pop.

2989
02:54:53,159 --> 02:54:53,399
Hey.

2990
02:54:54,120 --> 02:54:56,200
I'll see you tomorrow.

2991
02:54:56,840 --> 02:55:00,870
Let me get my coat.

2992
02:55:00,870 --> 02:55:01,989
I'll wait for you outside.

2993
02:55:02,629 --> 02:55:11,239
You okay?

2994
02:55:11,879 --> 02:55:13,559
I don't need anyone walking me home.

2995
02:55:14,370 --> 02:55:16,610
Hey, we were talking about meeting up tonight anyway.

2996
02:55:17,569 --> 02:55:21,569
Quit goofing off.

2997
02:55:21,569 --> 02:55:32,549
Okay.

2998
02:55:32,549 --> 02:55:33,590
I'll wait for you, I guess.

2999
02:55:44,260 --> 02:55:45,299
You with me or not?

3000
02:55:54,709 --> 02:55:55,350
AFK.

3001
02:55:57,680 --> 02:55:59,200
Hey, welcome to stream AFK.

3002
02:56:00,879 --> 02:56:01,200
Ow.

3003
02:56:02,149 --> 02:56:02,950
Oh, cookies.

3004
02:56:03,670 --> 02:56:04,309
Hey, guys.

3005
02:56:04,309 --> 02:56:05,270
What is it?

3006
02:56:05,270 --> 02:56:07,329
What is he gonna think?

3007
02:56:07,329 --> 02:56:11,520
He treats me like a kid sometimes.

3008
02:56:11,520 --> 02:56:12,930
Hey, I get it.

3009
02:56:12,930 --> 02:56:14,209
He's protective.

3010
02:56:14,209 --> 02:56:15,010
He's seen things.

3011
02:56:15,649 --> 02:56:17,729
We've all seen things.

3012
02:56:17,729 --> 02:56:19,329
What am I holding?

3013
02:56:19,969 --> 02:56:22,559
We gotta talk about you stealing food.

3014
02:56:23,360 --> 02:56:26,159
Hey, I cook it, so I get to say where it goes.

3015
02:56:26,799 --> 02:56:27,729
We won't say.

3016
02:56:27,729 --> 02:56:28,129
Wait, is it-

3017
02:56:28,129 --> 02:56:29,090
Are we gonna go on a date or something?

3018
02:56:29,090 --> 02:56:31,729
Well, maybe tomorrow's finally gonna be the day he fixes his own food.

3019
02:56:31,729 --> 02:56:49,139
He's hoping it.

3020
02:56:49,139 --> 02:56:55,110
All right, now let's run.

3021
02:56:55,110 --> 02:57:03,120
Hello?

3022
02:57:03,120 --> 02:57:05,459
Yeah, oh, it's not as much as last time.

3023
02:57:06,180 --> 02:57:07,299
It's enough.

3024
02:57:07,299 --> 02:57:09,319
No one thinks you're an angel.

3025
02:57:09,319 --> 02:57:11,399
The dawn hates being food go to waste.

3026
02:57:12,360 --> 02:57:15,079
And this, this has gotta be Tommy.

3027
02:57:15,639 --> 02:57:16,440
This is Tommy.

3028
02:57:16,440 --> 02:57:18,420
They told us all about you.

3029
02:57:18,420 --> 02:57:19,059
Isn't that right?

3030
02:57:19,780 --> 02:57:21,940
Your famous race driver, Tom.

3031
02:57:21,940 --> 02:57:23,139
Everyone talks about you.

3032
02:57:24,020 --> 02:57:25,059
Yeah, she's right.

3033
02:57:25,780 --> 02:57:29,319
They talk about anything in particular besides that I just won the race?

3034
02:57:29,319 --> 02:57:30,760
Nothing about how hard it was?

3035
02:57:32,680 --> 02:57:33,559
No, not yet.

3036
02:57:33,559 --> 02:57:34,200
Not that I've heard.

3037
02:57:34,200 --> 02:57:34,840
I'll see you at church.

3038
02:57:34,840 --> 02:57:35,340
Good.

3039
02:57:46,870 --> 02:57:47,510
All right, Sarah.

3040
02:57:48,530 --> 02:57:49,569
We had a wonderful date.

3041
02:57:50,129 --> 02:57:51,649
It's been really fun.

3042
02:57:51,649 --> 02:57:54,100
It's nice you do that, Tom.

3043
02:57:54,100 --> 02:58:02,920
Well, three people on this block.

3044
02:58:04,000 --> 02:58:06,319
Trump voice is the lowest form of comedy that you have.

3045
02:58:06,319 --> 02:58:06,819
What?

3046
02:58:09,030 --> 02:58:09,430
Who's-

3047
02:58:09,430 --> 02:58:10,389
One of the-

3048
02:58:10,389 --> 02:58:11,110
Donald Trump?

3049
02:58:11,110 --> 02:58:11,670
What are you talking about?

3050
02:58:11,670 --> 02:58:12,309
I was-

3051
02:58:12,309 --> 02:58:13,270
This is this guy.

3052
02:58:13,270 --> 02:58:13,989
What are you talking about?

3053
02:58:13,989 --> 02:58:14,709
That's all you got?

3054
02:58:14,709 --> 02:58:17,649
You spend all the time with a lady killer like Sam Trepine.

3055
02:58:17,649 --> 02:58:20,049
Just because you go like this doesn't mean it's Donald.

3056
02:58:20,049 --> 02:58:21,569
I have it automatically, Donald.

3057
02:58:21,569 --> 02:58:23,090
I was doing his voice.

3058
02:58:23,090 --> 02:58:33,059
I wasn't doing Trump.

3059
02:58:33,059 --> 02:58:33,559
No.

3060
02:58:36,290 --> 02:58:36,790
No.

3061
02:58:52,469 --> 02:58:53,670
Is there gonna be a fight or something here?

3062
02:58:53,670 --> 02:59:00,680
No.

3063
02:59:00,680 --> 02:59:02,180
I mentioned it to dad this one time.

3064
02:59:02,180 --> 02:59:04,819
And all of a sudden he gets you to be my knight in shining armor.

3065
02:59:04,819 --> 02:59:06,260
No, no, Sarah.

3066
02:59:06,260 --> 02:59:06,579
Don't worry.

3067
02:59:06,579 --> 02:59:07,299
These are all actors.

3068
02:59:08,399 --> 02:59:09,040
All of them.

3069
02:59:09,040 --> 02:59:09,840
Well, like I said-

3070
02:59:09,840 --> 02:59:10,879
Every single fucking one.

3071
02:59:10,879 --> 02:59:11,680
Please, there's no problem.

3072
02:59:11,680 --> 02:59:17,860
He said you wouldn't want other guys I dated.

3073
02:59:17,860 --> 02:59:25,270
I'm trying to save Tommy and all.

3074
02:59:25,270 --> 02:59:26,870
These guys over here playing dice,

3075
02:59:26,870 --> 02:59:30,069
they're gonna do the exact same movements over and over again.

3076
02:59:30,069 --> 02:59:31,649
Pictures made.

3077
02:59:31,649 --> 02:59:33,010
They gotta make sure they stay in the camera.

3078
02:59:33,010 --> 02:59:34,370
They did blocking earlier.

3079
02:59:34,370 --> 02:59:35,989
Check that out.

3080
02:59:35,989 --> 02:59:42,069
Sarah, this camera's in every fucking direction.

3081
02:59:42,069 --> 02:59:49,239
Are you stepping-

3082
02:59:49,239 --> 02:59:51,040
Piss off.

3083
02:59:51,040 --> 02:59:56,159
We'll let your boyfriend watch.

3084
02:59:56,159 --> 02:59:57,200
What do you say?

3085
02:59:57,200 --> 02:59:58,799
We going to have trouble here.

3086
02:59:58,799 --> 03:00:01,680
Trouble started back when you tried to steal our girl, chief.

3087
03:00:02,559 --> 03:00:04,319
You saps aren't careful.

3088
03:00:05,040 --> 03:00:06,559
You'll end up in wooden overcoats.

3089
03:00:09,350 --> 03:00:10,629
Last chance to walk away.

3090
03:00:11,350 --> 03:00:12,309
We ain't for ales.

3091
03:00:13,190 --> 03:00:14,469
We know who you work for.

3092
03:00:15,969 --> 03:00:19,010
Sally Erie might have been the big six when he was younger,

3093
03:00:19,010 --> 03:00:21,250
but he's all washed up now.

3094
03:00:21,250 --> 03:00:22,129
It's only a matter of time-

3095
03:00:22,129 --> 03:00:22,850
Zoomer hair.

3096
03:00:24,129 --> 03:00:26,129
I need Sally Erie.

3097
03:00:26,930 --> 03:00:27,809
Or anyone else.

3098
03:00:28,979 --> 03:00:29,620
Not for this.

3099
03:00:32,559 --> 03:00:35,540
See what you got, cake eater.

3100
03:00:35,540 --> 03:00:36,739
All right, so I just kicked their asses.

3101
03:00:36,739 --> 03:00:37,860
This is where we let off to.

3102
03:00:39,350 --> 03:00:41,430
Uh, I just pulled a grenade.

3103
03:00:52,530 --> 03:00:53,030
Weapon.

3104
03:00:59,520 --> 03:01:00,399
You still want to fight me?

3105
03:01:09,889 --> 03:01:11,170
Okay, at what point would you run?

3106
03:01:11,170 --> 03:01:11,969
Okay, I run now.

3107
03:01:16,120 --> 03:01:17,079
Oh, no.

3108
03:01:17,079 --> 03:01:18,680
He changed the difficulty to easy.

3109
03:01:19,399 --> 03:01:21,120
This is supposed to be a fist fight.

3110
03:01:21,760 --> 03:01:23,059
Let's get out of here.

3111
03:01:37,280 --> 03:01:37,780
Ooh.

3112
03:01:38,559 --> 03:01:41,719
Okay, am I gonna get in trouble for that?

3113
03:01:42,280 --> 03:01:48,879
Push me?

3114
03:01:52,840 --> 03:01:53,799
Stab him.

3115
03:01:53,799 --> 03:02:04,290
Holy shit.

3116
03:02:08,520 --> 03:02:09,319
Oh, boss.

3117
03:02:12,500 --> 03:02:27,409
Fuck it.

3118
03:02:27,409 --> 03:02:27,909
Ooh.

3119
03:02:39,620 --> 03:02:40,579
Oh, my God.

3120
03:02:40,579 --> 03:02:42,819
This guy would be out in a second, dude.

3121
03:02:52,850 --> 03:02:53,729
God damn it, man.

3122
03:02:53,729 --> 03:02:54,770
How many running hits do I-

3123
03:02:54,770 --> 03:02:57,139
That's what I got, you little bitch.

3124
03:02:57,139 --> 03:03:03,540
Do I kill him?

3125
03:03:03,540 --> 03:03:06,069
All right, get to Sarah.

3126
03:03:06,069 --> 03:03:06,549
Give me the bat.

3127
03:03:07,110 --> 03:03:18,530
All right, they're all actors.

3128
03:03:18,530 --> 03:03:19,489
You got a good right hook.

3129
03:03:19,489 --> 03:03:20,129
I'll give you that.

3130
03:03:22,440 --> 03:03:23,079
You're bleeding.

3131
03:03:24,309 --> 03:03:25,510
Come up to my place.

3132
03:03:25,510 --> 03:03:26,309
I'll take a look.

3133
03:03:27,860 --> 03:03:28,500
Am I, though?

3134
03:03:28,979 --> 03:03:31,040
Is I supposed to be bleeding?

3135
03:03:41,059 --> 03:03:45,750
Yeah, their blood is all over my arms.

3136
03:04:05,750 --> 03:04:06,250
Where?

3137
03:04:08,629 --> 03:04:09,110
Oh, on my-

3138
03:04:09,110 --> 03:04:10,229
It's supposed to be on the arm.

3139
03:04:19,780 --> 03:04:20,420
What do you got?

3140
03:04:23,700 --> 03:04:24,819
Compliments of the done.

3141
03:04:34,739 --> 03:04:35,239
Nice.

3142
03:04:35,780 --> 03:04:36,850
Take another.

3143
03:04:37,809 --> 03:04:41,940
I mean, I get-

3144
03:04:41,940 --> 03:04:43,139
All right.

3145
03:04:43,139 --> 03:04:44,180
You gonna grin and bear this?

3146
03:04:44,180 --> 03:04:45,780
Is this like the 1600s?

3147
03:04:45,780 --> 03:04:47,219
Yeah, I'll be okay.

3148
03:04:47,219 --> 03:04:47,719
Good.

3149
03:04:49,270 --> 03:04:53,110
You were like doctors and you didn't just like drink alcohol to do-

3150
03:04:53,110 --> 03:04:54,229
take care of wounds and shit.

3151
03:04:54,229 --> 03:04:55,590
Think about it, will ya?

3152
03:04:55,590 --> 03:04:57,190
It's gonna take as long as it takes.

3153
03:04:58,149 --> 03:05:01,270
The sloppier the stitch, the uglier the scar.

3154
03:05:01,270 --> 03:05:01,829
Yes, you did.

3155
03:05:01,829 --> 03:05:02,329
Am I right?

3156
03:05:03,110 --> 03:05:05,809
You stitched up a lot of fellas.

3157
03:05:05,809 --> 03:05:06,930
Getting rid of scurvy.

3158
03:05:37,889 --> 03:05:38,690
It's just duct tape.

3159
03:05:45,909 --> 03:06:00,760
Yeah, you're in a full suit.

3160
03:06:01,319 --> 03:06:01,799
You wanna-

3161
03:06:01,799 --> 03:06:02,440
No, no, no.

3162
03:06:02,440 --> 03:06:03,639
This thing never comes off, ever.

3163
03:06:05,409 --> 03:06:06,610
I shower in this fucking thing.

3164
03:06:20,870 --> 03:06:21,370
Sarah.

3165
03:06:24,389 --> 03:06:26,389
Hey, Mayo, thanks for the five community subs.

3166
03:06:26,389 --> 03:06:29,110
And also Rip, Alex Trebek, thanks for the five community subs, too.

3167
03:06:29,110 --> 03:06:32,280
He has a drop in subs today.

3168
03:06:34,260 --> 03:06:34,760
Thank you.

3169
03:06:43,239 --> 03:06:45,639
She started working here before she could see over the bar.

3170
03:06:46,520 --> 03:06:48,950
I don't have a daughter of my own, Tom.

3171
03:06:48,950 --> 03:06:51,639
I'd do anything for Luigi's little girl.

3172
03:06:52,760 --> 03:06:53,319
So would I.

3173
03:06:55,680 --> 03:06:56,319
We all would.

3174
03:06:56,959 --> 03:06:58,129
That's right, boss.

3175
03:06:58,850 --> 03:07:00,209
Anything for Luigi and Sarah.

3176
03:07:00,209 --> 03:07:02,690
Do those bastards think this is fucking Luna Parker?

3177
03:07:02,690 --> 03:07:03,809
I'd just say Jimmy Fallon.

3178
03:07:03,809 --> 03:07:04,309
That's all I-

3179
03:07:04,309 --> 03:07:06,049
I'll rip him apart with my own hands.

3180
03:07:06,049 --> 03:07:09,569
Just, I'm waiting for him to start laughing and look into the camera and giggle and shit.

3181
03:07:09,569 --> 03:07:12,850
But who's gonna pay up when they learn we can't even protect one of our own

3182
03:07:12,850 --> 03:07:14,049
as she walks home from work?

3183
03:07:14,850 --> 03:07:15,969
So what do you want us to do?

3184
03:07:17,090 --> 03:07:18,049
Teach these boys-

3185
03:07:18,049 --> 03:07:20,209
Yeah, I would do anything for Sarah.

3186
03:07:20,209 --> 03:07:21,170
I would do anything for Sarah.

3187
03:07:21,170 --> 03:07:22,209
Put them in their bodies.

3188
03:07:22,209 --> 03:07:23,329
Put them in wheelchairs.

3189
03:07:23,329 --> 03:07:28,049
Bust their faces up so bad even their mothers can't look at them without screaming.

3190
03:07:28,049 --> 03:07:29,799
We know where they're holed up.

3191
03:07:29,799 --> 03:07:33,639
My friend on the floor says we should start looking in the Chinatown.

3192
03:07:33,639 --> 03:07:35,159
Then Big Biff will know something.

3193
03:07:35,879 --> 03:07:39,079
Tommy, go to Vinnie, get us some gear.

3194
03:07:39,079 --> 03:07:40,280
Meet me at Biff's place.

3195
03:07:40,280 --> 03:07:40,840
Yeah, okay.

3196
03:07:41,639 --> 03:07:43,399
Leave these punks laying in the street.

3197
03:07:44,120 --> 03:07:45,479
I want everyone to know.

3198
03:07:46,040 --> 03:07:50,120
We do not allow mad dogs to run wild in our neighborhood.

3199
03:07:50,120 --> 03:07:51,000
You got it, boss.

3200
03:07:52,120 --> 03:07:58,690
Some of these sons of bitches could still be on our turf.

3201
03:07:58,690 --> 03:07:58,930
Go.

3202
03:07:58,930 --> 03:08:00,049
I'll check the neighborhood.

3203
03:08:00,690 --> 03:08:02,770
Make sure they're gone while you see Biff.

3204
03:08:02,770 --> 03:08:03,250
Good, huh?

3205
03:08:03,250 --> 03:08:05,329
I'm gonna take a selfie with an anime character filter.

3206
03:08:05,329 --> 03:08:07,010
Okay, so when you're done with Vinnie, come find me-

3207
03:08:07,010 --> 03:08:09,649
Uh, I don't know what that means.

3208
03:08:10,610 --> 03:08:11,729
Like a Snapchat thing?

3209
03:08:11,729 --> 03:08:12,690
I don't have Snapchat.

3210
03:08:13,569 --> 03:08:17,520
All right, talk to Vincenzo.

3211
03:08:18,079 --> 03:08:22,790
Like, get in the car, talk to Vincenzo.

3212
03:08:23,350 --> 03:08:26,209
All right, talk to Vincenzo.

3213
03:08:26,209 --> 03:08:30,680
You got a new weapon for me?

3214
03:08:30,680 --> 03:08:32,760
I can- give me like a grenade or something.

3215
03:08:32,760 --> 03:08:38,440
Hey, hey, here for some heaters, Tom.

3216
03:08:39,000 --> 03:08:41,399
Nah, I'm already going and healed.

3217
03:08:41,399 --> 03:08:42,899
All in me.

3218
03:08:42,899 --> 03:08:45,379
We gotta give a beating to some punks who've been on our turf.

3219
03:08:46,100 --> 03:08:49,280
I don't want to pull this and piss in our own street.

3220
03:08:50,079 --> 03:08:51,620
There's something to bust heads.

3221
03:08:51,620 --> 03:08:52,420
That's all we need.

3222
03:08:53,059 --> 03:08:56,870
Why is this guy the-

3223
03:08:56,870 --> 03:08:59,190
Sam turned over some guys' ware house.

3224
03:08:59,190 --> 03:09:01,350
1930s Q from James Bond.

3225
03:09:01,350 --> 03:09:03,510
Gotta grab that babe roof himself, the guy said.

3226
03:09:04,069 --> 03:09:06,549
I mean, that's horse shit, but they bust heads.

3227
03:09:06,629 --> 03:09:07,670
It's just baseball bats.

3228
03:09:10,899 --> 03:09:11,860
This is not something-

3229
03:09:11,860 --> 03:09:13,700
Oh, yeah, what an elaborate thing.

3230
03:09:13,700 --> 03:09:15,540
You could just go buy these at Walmart.

3231
03:09:15,540 --> 03:09:16,899
Why do we need a guy for this?

3232
03:09:17,620 --> 03:09:19,299
Just go get some baseball bats.

3233
03:09:19,299 --> 03:09:22,899
Anywhere in the fucking whole world.

3234
03:09:22,899 --> 03:09:24,739
We really need a guy for that?

3235
03:09:40,739 --> 03:09:43,219
1930s mafia James Bond.

3236
03:09:43,860 --> 03:09:45,479
Hey, here's a bat.

3237
03:09:46,360 --> 03:09:47,799
Oh, cool, this is a normal bat.

3238
03:09:47,799 --> 03:09:49,719
Does the top open and a little gun comes out,

3239
03:09:49,719 --> 03:09:51,639
just a little knife that shoots out and stabs somebody with a dart?

3240
03:09:52,360 --> 03:09:56,040
Nah, you just hit him in the fucking skull and they die.

3241
03:09:57,329 --> 03:10:09,110
Oh, okay, it's corked.

3242
03:10:15,889 --> 03:10:17,170
I can't drive past this.

3243
03:10:17,889 --> 03:10:19,760
I like the rain, though.

3244
03:10:19,760 --> 03:10:20,239
Nice touch.

3245
03:10:28,450 --> 03:10:29,649
Why even shape them into bats?

3246
03:10:29,649 --> 03:10:31,729
Just buy wood and give-

3247
03:10:32,370 --> 03:10:35,489
Just go to like Home Depot and buy a bunch of 2x4s,

3248
03:10:35,489 --> 03:10:37,569
cut them in half and use those instead.

3249
03:10:37,569 --> 03:10:38,209
It's probably cheaper.

3250
03:10:38,930 --> 03:10:46,479
Why does it have to be a bat?

3251
03:10:46,479 --> 03:10:48,149
It does the same thing.

3252
03:10:48,149 --> 03:10:51,860
It's a piece of wood that's heavy you hit somebody with.

3253
03:10:55,090 --> 03:10:55,329
Break?

3254
03:10:55,329 --> 03:10:56,450
Well, bat would break, too, wouldn't it?

3255
03:11:02,420 --> 03:11:03,700
All right, Polly, what are we doing?

3256
03:11:32,040 --> 03:11:32,680
I want to get my bat.

3257
03:11:32,680 --> 03:11:34,280
Follow Polly to Biff's pawn shop.

3258
03:11:36,079 --> 03:11:37,120
I gotta keep following Polly.

3259
03:11:55,350 --> 03:11:56,069
There's a bear in here.

3260
03:12:07,989 --> 03:12:08,709
Name Billy.

3261
03:12:09,590 --> 03:12:12,469
Pals with a prissy chump and a boozer with a bald head.

3262
03:12:12,469 --> 03:12:14,469
Right, right, I know them.

3263
03:12:14,469 --> 03:12:17,350
They're set up in the old service station in a block over.

3264
03:12:18,069 --> 03:12:19,190
They hock some gear every-

3265
03:12:19,190 --> 03:12:20,389
I want to- I would like to walk.

3266
03:12:20,389 --> 03:12:21,590
...small time.

3267
03:12:21,590 --> 03:12:24,079
Here to come to you, Biff.

3268
03:12:24,079 --> 03:12:25,520
You're good with small time.

3269
03:12:25,520 --> 03:12:27,360
Out the bed, cross the street.

3270
03:12:27,360 --> 03:12:28,639
You'll find them there.

3271
03:12:28,639 --> 03:12:29,040
Thanks.

3272
03:12:29,760 --> 03:12:30,879
See you around.

3273
03:12:30,879 --> 03:12:33,670
Hey, Polly, about that dough?

3274
03:12:33,670 --> 03:12:36,549
Axe is waiting for my guy to come through.

3275
03:12:36,549 --> 03:12:36,870
Okay.

3276
03:12:36,870 --> 03:12:38,309
Next week, just sit tight.

3277
03:12:39,270 --> 03:12:41,809
I feel like I'm having deja vu.

3278
03:12:41,809 --> 03:12:43,299
I really am.

3279
03:12:43,299 --> 03:12:46,579
This is like mission four in a row, besides the racing one,

3280
03:12:46,579 --> 03:12:49,139
where Q gives you a baseball bat,

3281
03:12:49,139 --> 03:12:50,739
and you've walked into a store with it.

3282
03:12:59,379 --> 03:13:00,260
But I don't even use it.

3283
03:13:11,440 --> 03:13:13,200
Let me go back to the car racing.

3284
03:13:14,719 --> 03:13:15,680
No, I'm not doing that.

3285
03:13:15,680 --> 03:13:16,239
I already beat it.

3286
03:13:16,239 --> 03:13:18,000
It was really hard.

3287
03:13:18,639 --> 03:13:19,360
But I did it, though.

3288
03:13:22,520 --> 03:13:25,879
All we gotta do is find the other guys in Chinatown who look like we do.

3289
03:13:26,850 --> 03:13:27,409
There it is.

3290
03:13:29,700 --> 03:13:30,260
There's what?

3291
03:13:31,489 --> 03:13:32,049
A.S.T.A.T.I.A.N.?

3292
03:13:36,319 --> 03:13:37,280
It's sub one hour?

3293
03:13:37,280 --> 03:13:38,319
Yeah, it's true.

3294
03:13:42,500 --> 03:13:52,500
Can we at least run?

3295
03:13:53,219 --> 03:14:01,799
This game is really fun and it's really cool,

3296
03:14:01,799 --> 03:14:05,079
but they really do like to slow down to L.A. Noire levels

3297
03:14:05,969 --> 03:14:06,850
in some of these missions.

3298
03:14:07,489 --> 03:14:10,840
Kick the door.

3299
03:14:11,479 --> 03:14:14,129
Tell me a nicest A.S.T. I've ever seen in my life.

3300
03:14:19,170 --> 03:14:29,299
Synchronized cigarettes is what I was gonna say.

3301
03:14:30,020 --> 03:14:41,270
It's a Marvel movie?

3302
03:14:41,829 --> 03:14:48,020
This guy's got a bat, too.

3303
03:14:56,549 --> 03:14:57,510
Captain America.

3304
03:14:58,469 --> 03:15:01,989
They are doing the Marvel movie one, two, three sequence.

3305
03:15:03,170 --> 03:15:04,690
Punch, block, punch, punch.

3306
03:15:05,329 --> 03:15:06,870
Block with one arm.

3307
03:15:06,870 --> 03:15:07,750
Punch with left arm.

3308
03:15:07,750 --> 03:15:08,469
Block, punch.

3309
03:15:10,149 --> 03:15:10,790
Into the stomach.

3310
03:15:10,790 --> 03:15:11,270
Into the chest.

3311
03:15:11,270 --> 03:15:11,750
Into the head.

3312
03:15:12,389 --> 03:15:14,129
One at a time.

3313
03:15:14,129 --> 03:15:24,450
Yeah, it always makes this really crazy sound.

3314
03:15:24,450 --> 03:15:27,799
Like this, like, when they punch.

3315
03:15:28,600 --> 03:15:41,719
It's like, oh, wait, I have to run around.

3316
03:15:41,719 --> 03:15:42,360
Let's go this way.

3317
03:15:52,200 --> 03:15:52,840
Jump over it.

3318
03:15:55,639 --> 03:15:56,040
What?

3319
03:15:56,040 --> 03:15:56,680
Oh, shit.

3320
03:15:58,159 --> 03:15:59,840
Oh, that guy's on fire.

3321
03:16:01,840 --> 03:16:02,879
I didn't even do this.

3322
03:16:02,879 --> 03:16:03,840
I feel like I didn't do anything.

3323
03:16:15,200 --> 03:16:20,610
I keep shooting this guy in the ass.

3324
03:16:20,610 --> 03:16:21,170
Is he dead?

3325
03:16:21,889 --> 03:16:35,170
What?

3326
03:16:35,170 --> 03:16:36,290
That was right in the fucking head.

3327
03:16:37,010 --> 03:16:44,000
We're good.

3328
03:16:44,000 --> 03:16:45,040
I have two bullets left.

3329
03:16:45,040 --> 03:16:51,000
Oh, it's not on easy.

3330
03:16:51,000 --> 03:16:51,959
This is on classic mode.

3331
03:16:58,260 --> 03:17:02,579
The health chair.

3332
03:17:03,219 --> 03:17:10,899
Wait, who's who?

3333
03:17:13,409 --> 03:17:13,889
Who's who?

3334
03:17:15,040 --> 03:17:16,079
Was that guy a friend?

3335
03:17:16,079 --> 03:17:16,559
I don't know.

3336
03:17:17,440 --> 03:17:19,440
Is this a bad guy?

3337
03:17:20,000 --> 03:17:26,399
I think we did it.

3338
03:17:35,250 --> 03:17:35,729
Is this hot?

3339
03:17:35,729 --> 03:17:36,450
Can I go in here?

3340
03:17:49,510 --> 03:17:51,030
He's not good either.

3341
03:17:51,030 --> 03:17:52,069
It's okay.

3342
03:17:52,069 --> 03:17:53,270
We both got surprised.

3343
03:17:57,379 --> 03:17:58,500
He's the one that opened the door.

3344
03:17:58,500 --> 03:17:59,940
How is he so surprised to see me?

3345
03:18:04,040 --> 03:18:04,440
Hands up.

3346
03:18:05,000 --> 03:18:07,889
Catch up to Billy.

3347
03:18:07,889 --> 03:18:08,290
Oh, shit.

3348
03:18:08,290 --> 03:18:08,930
Catch up to Billy.

3349
03:18:09,729 --> 03:18:17,510
Fucking whack-a-mole.

3350
03:18:18,069 --> 03:18:21,440
He dropped it.

3351
03:18:21,440 --> 03:18:22,159
Nice throw.

3352
03:18:22,719 --> 03:18:23,360
Nice throw.

3353
03:18:24,399 --> 03:18:31,190
Watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out.

3354
03:18:34,770 --> 03:18:35,649
I get him.

3355
03:18:35,649 --> 03:18:45,639
One more guy.

3356
03:18:45,639 --> 03:18:46,879
Where is he?

3357
03:18:46,879 --> 03:18:49,889
Who's shooting?

3358
03:18:49,889 --> 03:18:52,610
You're aiming the gun at me.

3359
03:18:53,170 --> 03:19:03,200
On me.

3360
03:19:03,200 --> 03:19:03,520
Look out.

3361
03:19:03,520 --> 03:19:03,680
What?

3362
03:19:06,549 --> 03:19:07,270
Stupid idea.

3363
03:19:07,989 --> 03:19:08,709
Very stupid.

3364
03:19:09,600 --> 03:19:11,600
Completely out of your element there, man.

3365
03:19:11,600 --> 03:19:13,040
You can run straight at me with a gun.

3366
03:19:27,860 --> 03:19:29,059
Random crit?

3367
03:19:29,059 --> 03:19:35,170
Oh, not this shit.

3368
03:19:37,879 --> 03:19:39,079
Don't let the punks escape.

3369
03:19:39,079 --> 03:19:39,799
Sure, I'll get it.

3370
03:19:43,059 --> 03:19:44,899
I have 21 shots.

3371
03:19:44,899 --> 03:19:47,139
That's not a whole lot of ammo.

3372
03:19:48,120 --> 03:19:48,920
It's raining too.

3373
03:19:48,920 --> 03:19:49,559
I got to be careful.

3374
03:19:59,569 --> 03:20:00,129
Oh, boy.

3375
03:20:03,120 --> 03:20:05,200
Oh, look at...

3376
03:20:05,200 --> 03:20:17,540
Shit.

3377
03:20:20,719 --> 03:20:22,159
Road is so slippery.

3378
03:20:34,659 --> 03:20:36,500
No, I'm going to lose him.

3379
03:20:37,299 --> 03:20:40,739
No, I'm okay.

3380
03:20:49,889 --> 03:21:04,479
We could have just chased him on foot

3381
03:21:04,479 --> 03:21:05,200
and would have been better.

3382
03:21:05,840 --> 03:21:08,200
At least we could have snuck down alleyways.

3383
03:21:08,840 --> 03:21:16,610
How did he pass the racing mission?

3384
03:21:16,610 --> 03:21:17,809
That was pretty tough.

3385
03:21:17,809 --> 03:21:18,370
Took me a while.

3386
03:21:19,090 --> 03:21:23,440
I really zeroed in though on the menu

3387
03:21:24,159 --> 03:21:28,450
when I made it easy on dude.

3388
03:21:28,450 --> 03:21:29,010
Seriously.

3389
03:21:33,010 --> 03:21:33,569
Jesus.

3390
03:21:40,239 --> 03:21:41,200
Oh, it's all right.

3391
03:21:41,200 --> 03:21:41,840
We got Luigi.

3392
03:21:45,299 --> 03:21:46,899
This is a bit...

3393
03:21:46,899 --> 03:21:47,860
They're going to wake up with guns.

3394
03:21:59,670 --> 03:22:00,309
Through the game.

3395
03:22:15,110 --> 03:22:21,909
That car is mangled.

3396
03:22:22,709 --> 03:22:24,719
What did they crash into?

3397
03:22:30,069 --> 03:22:31,190
We weren't going that fast.

3398
03:22:46,930 --> 03:22:47,569
Ah, shit.

3399
03:22:47,569 --> 03:22:48,290
He disconnected.

3400
03:22:49,170 --> 03:22:51,379
I'll wait.

3401
03:22:51,379 --> 03:22:52,020
He might come back.

3402
03:22:54,260 --> 03:22:56,100
Game's fucking multiplayer sucks, Tommy.

3403
03:22:56,100 --> 03:22:56,659
I swear to God.

3404
03:23:04,149 --> 03:23:15,190
Where to get used to it?

3405
03:23:15,190 --> 03:23:21,170
He was in the pause menu setting it to easy.

3406
03:23:21,729 --> 03:23:22,930
That's pretty good.

3407
03:23:24,469 --> 03:23:25,430
That's really good.

3408
03:23:31,520 --> 03:23:32,399
Simple straight.

3409
03:23:35,170 --> 03:23:35,489
Nice.

3410
03:23:36,049 --> 03:23:36,530
Very nice.

3411
03:23:39,379 --> 03:23:41,620
I can't afford this life no more.

3412
03:23:41,620 --> 03:23:42,500
Just getting lucky.

3413
03:23:43,059 --> 03:23:44,739
I'll give you a chance to win your money back.

3414
03:23:45,620 --> 03:23:46,579
You want in, boss?

3415
03:23:48,469 --> 03:23:50,149
We have business to discuss, Paulie.

3416
03:23:51,030 --> 03:23:52,069
We're in it now, boys.

3417
03:23:52,709 --> 03:23:54,149
One of our associates at the court

3418
03:23:54,149 --> 03:23:55,430
in this office sent his over.

3419
03:23:56,309 --> 03:23:58,709
Corpse's name is Joe Ortiz.

3420
03:23:59,350 --> 03:24:00,610
You recognize him?

3421
03:24:01,250 --> 03:24:01,569
Sure.

3422
03:24:02,129 --> 03:24:03,969
That's one of the punks we ran out of the neighborhood.

3423
03:24:04,690 --> 03:24:06,370
Now we got the bullet in the back of his head?

3424
03:24:06,370 --> 03:24:07,010
He did it.

3425
03:24:07,010 --> 03:24:07,489
He did it.

3426
03:24:07,489 --> 03:24:08,129
Jimmy found it.

3427
03:24:08,850 --> 03:24:10,049
Well, the cops ought to thank us.

3428
03:24:10,049 --> 03:24:11,250
We did him a favor.

3429
03:24:11,250 --> 03:24:12,770
The guy was a rapist, boss.

3430
03:24:12,770 --> 03:24:13,270
Yeah?

3431
03:24:13,729 --> 03:24:15,829
Well, he was also a city councilor's son.

3432
03:24:16,549 --> 03:24:18,870
You want to drive a politician into Marella's arms?

3433
03:24:18,870 --> 03:24:20,790
There's no better way than killing off his family.

3434
03:24:21,829 --> 03:24:22,549
That gets worse.

3435
03:24:23,190 --> 03:24:24,870
You left another guy in the wreck?

3436
03:24:24,870 --> 03:24:28,549
In any piece of media, is there ever a senator's son

3437
03:24:29,350 --> 03:24:31,270
that's not a bad guy?

3438
03:24:31,270 --> 03:24:33,350
If you're going to do a job, do it right.

3439
03:24:33,350 --> 03:24:34,469
He made it?

3440
03:24:34,469 --> 03:24:34,790
Yes.

3441
03:24:35,350 --> 03:24:37,190
He spent the week in Santa Mary's, but...

3442
03:24:37,190 --> 03:24:37,989
You killed that guy.

3443
03:24:37,989 --> 03:24:39,190
He was a senator's son.

3444
03:24:39,190 --> 03:24:40,950
Can he point a finger at either of you?

3445
03:24:40,950 --> 03:24:43,670
He was a murderer, rapist, killer, drug addict,

3446
03:24:44,610 --> 03:24:46,770
and he like beat up dogs for fun.

3447
03:24:47,329 --> 03:24:50,600
Look, Senator's son, by the way.

3448
03:24:51,479 --> 03:24:53,879
Galati's funeral's today at St. Michael's.

3449
03:24:53,879 --> 03:24:55,809
Sam, you're going to attend.

3450
03:24:56,370 --> 03:24:58,709
Sit in the back and try to spot the lucky bastard.

3451
03:24:59,510 --> 03:25:01,190
How will I recognize him?

3452
03:25:01,190 --> 03:25:03,750
He'll be the one who just crawled away from a car wreck.

3453
03:25:04,469 --> 03:25:05,750
His arm is broken.

3454
03:25:05,750 --> 03:25:06,629
Look for a sling.

3455
03:25:07,590 --> 03:25:09,430
Sam's going to need a little distraction

3456
03:25:09,430 --> 03:25:10,790
if he's going to clean up your mess.

3457
03:25:11,510 --> 03:25:13,270
He's sending Tommy to dip his wick?

3458
03:25:14,229 --> 03:25:15,110
It's a brothel?

3459
03:25:15,110 --> 03:25:17,989
A gentleman's club, just down the street from St. Michael's.

3460
03:25:18,629 --> 03:25:21,670
Madonna's invested a lot of money in it over the years.

3461
03:25:21,670 --> 03:25:22,629
So are me and Sam.

3462
03:25:22,629 --> 03:25:27,110
Sam, regardless, the owner has suddenly decided

3463
03:25:27,110 --> 03:25:29,750
to do business with Morello instead of us.

3464
03:25:29,750 --> 03:25:32,229
You want me to go remind him of his obligations?

3465
03:25:32,229 --> 03:25:34,739
Yes, then blow the place up.

3466
03:25:35,700 --> 03:25:36,200
What?

3467
03:25:36,739 --> 03:25:39,379
Morello wants to take businesses away from us?

3468
03:25:39,379 --> 03:25:40,899
He'll inherit craters.

3469
03:25:40,899 --> 03:25:45,219
Look, Tom, we can't send Paulie and Sam since all the ladies know them already.

3470
03:25:45,940 --> 03:25:47,940
Are we trying to not have so much heat put on us?

3471
03:25:47,940 --> 03:25:49,459
But you can walk right in.

3472
03:25:50,340 --> 03:25:52,489
Okay.

3473
03:25:53,350 --> 03:25:55,319
What about the manager?

3474
03:25:55,319 --> 03:25:56,440
Like I could syringe somebody.

3475
03:25:57,479 --> 03:26:00,200
If any of the horse see it, well, it'll be a warning.

3476
03:26:00,760 --> 03:26:03,639
Once he's out of the way, head to his office on the top floor.

3477
03:26:04,200 --> 03:26:07,879
Grab any documents and money you find there and place the explosives.

3478
03:26:07,879 --> 03:26:09,879
Vincenza will see that you have what you need.

3479
03:26:10,600 --> 03:26:13,159
And you think the blast will be big enough to give me cover?

3480
03:26:13,159 --> 03:26:14,840
Yeah, but be smart.

3481
03:26:15,399 --> 03:26:17,559
Only take a shot if you know you won't get made.

3482
03:26:19,030 --> 03:26:20,309
Tommy, one more thing.

3483
03:26:21,270 --> 03:26:24,709
One of the girls is passing Morello information about our operations.

3484
03:26:25,750 --> 03:26:28,870
Before you blow the place, you'll need to take care of her, too.

3485
03:26:30,790 --> 03:26:32,309
You want Tommy to kill a twist?

3486
03:26:33,190 --> 03:26:33,989
Come on, Frank.

3487
03:26:34,549 --> 03:26:36,469
It's just bad luck this falls to Tom.

3488
03:26:37,030 --> 03:26:38,629
But we gotta protect the family.

3489
03:26:39,590 --> 03:26:40,549
Her name is Michelle.

3490
03:26:40,549 --> 03:26:41,190
Wait, I have to-

3491
03:26:41,190 --> 03:26:42,950
She's usually working one of the upper rooms.

3492
03:26:42,950 --> 03:26:44,309
Gonna kill some lady?

3493
03:26:44,309 --> 03:26:45,750
Her photo is in the folder.

3494
03:26:47,030 --> 03:26:48,309
You boys clearing everything?

3495
03:26:54,450 --> 03:26:55,170
Yeah.

3496
03:26:55,170 --> 03:26:56,049
Tom.

3497
03:26:56,049 --> 03:26:56,850
Pay attention.

3498
03:26:57,649 --> 03:26:59,409
I got it, boss.

3499
03:26:59,409 --> 03:27:00,209
Then get it done.

3500
03:27:04,979 --> 03:27:07,299
What a reaction to have a thing that you're watching.

3501
03:27:09,040 --> 03:27:11,120
Do I have to kill some lady?

3502
03:27:11,120 --> 03:27:11,840
Yeah, man.

3503
03:27:11,840 --> 03:27:14,319
You probably should already know why and who that is.

3504
03:27:14,319 --> 03:27:16,930
And it's not just some lady you're killing.

3505
03:27:16,930 --> 03:27:17,969
What are you talking about, dude?

3506
03:27:17,969 --> 03:27:19,170
Are you even watching?

3507
03:27:21,120 --> 03:27:25,040
Am I playing, like, Candy Crush on my phone during every cutscene?

3508
03:27:25,040 --> 03:27:26,239
Sometimes it feels like that.

3509
03:27:35,239 --> 03:27:35,959
But I'm not, though.

3510
03:27:35,959 --> 03:27:38,280
I'm just staring blankly into, like, the colors.

3511
03:27:38,920 --> 03:27:40,319
Okay, what do you got for me, Q?

3512
03:27:43,940 --> 03:27:44,340
Thank you.

3513
03:27:44,899 --> 03:27:49,299
Not that special, just electrical tape and dynamite.

3514
03:27:49,379 --> 03:27:49,860
Thanks, Q.

3515
03:28:10,520 --> 03:28:11,799
Uh-oh, we're gonna get some exposition.

3516
03:28:31,649 --> 03:28:32,530
Hey, don't kill her.

3517
03:28:38,290 --> 03:28:40,770
Give it to her and make sure she gets far away.

3518
03:28:40,770 --> 03:28:41,489
A hundred bucks.

3519
03:28:41,489 --> 03:28:42,129
Okay, sir.

3520
03:28:42,850 --> 03:28:43,889
I'll see what I can do.

3521
03:28:43,889 --> 03:28:45,729
A hundred dollars in 1930 was, like, ten grand.

3522
03:28:45,729 --> 03:28:47,729
That's a lot of money.

3523
03:28:47,729 --> 03:28:55,559
This show, she's the one from the racetrack, right?

3524
03:28:55,559 --> 03:28:58,600
Tom, that was the last time we're ever gonna talk about her.

3525
03:28:58,600 --> 03:28:59,100
Ever.

3526
03:28:59,799 --> 03:29:00,440
I told you.

3527
03:29:00,440 --> 03:29:02,680
We won't tell the Don about that one.

3528
03:29:02,680 --> 03:29:05,079
Uh, hey, uh, Polly, was that her?

3529
03:29:05,079 --> 03:29:05,959
Hope not.

3530
03:29:05,959 --> 03:29:07,000
Oh, yeah.

3531
03:29:07,000 --> 03:29:09,239
Tom, that was the last time we were gonna talk about her.

3532
03:29:09,239 --> 03:29:13,479
I told you what I had to ask and you listened.

3533
03:29:14,120 --> 03:29:15,639
You gotta leave it there.

3534
03:29:15,639 --> 03:29:16,139
Okay.

3535
03:29:18,399 --> 03:29:18,899
Oops.

3536
03:29:23,059 --> 03:29:24,020
Okay, we're fine.

3537
03:29:24,020 --> 03:29:26,260
Keep your head when you get into the hotel.

3538
03:29:26,260 --> 03:29:28,020
Find your mark and don't act suspicious.

3539
03:29:33,399 --> 03:29:34,280
Is that for the gunshot?

3540
03:29:36,120 --> 03:29:37,479
One hundred was about 1.2k.

3541
03:29:38,760 --> 03:29:39,479
That's a lot of money.

3542
03:29:39,479 --> 03:29:40,360
You say about it.

3543
03:29:40,360 --> 03:29:43,829
If the bomb goes off, I'll do my thing.

3544
03:29:43,829 --> 03:29:44,329
Got it.

3545
03:29:48,180 --> 03:29:49,540
What's with you today, Tom?

3546
03:29:50,420 --> 03:29:53,219
What kind of world is it?

3547
03:29:53,540 --> 03:29:54,979
I want to ride a motorcycle.

3548
03:29:54,979 --> 03:29:56,500
You get sent to a cat house.

3549
03:29:57,139 --> 03:29:58,100
Well, I have to clean up.

3550
03:29:59,219 --> 03:29:59,940
Shit, wrong button.

3551
03:30:00,659 --> 03:30:06,100
Isn't that a cop right there?

3552
03:30:10,709 --> 03:30:16,819
Anyway, what was I saying?

3553
03:30:17,700 --> 03:30:18,739
Oh, yeah.

3554
03:30:18,739 --> 03:30:23,940
What kind of world is it that when you screw up, you get sent to a cat house?

3555
03:30:23,940 --> 03:30:26,500
Well, I have to clean up your mess at a funeral.

3556
03:30:26,500 --> 03:30:28,340
You see the justice in that?

3557
03:30:28,340 --> 03:30:28,979
I see you.

3558
03:30:28,979 --> 03:30:29,860
Unhinged.

3559
03:30:29,860 --> 03:30:31,540
I was just trying to get the fuck out of the way.

3560
03:30:32,100 --> 03:30:33,780
Just try to finish your job this time.

3561
03:30:38,260 --> 03:30:39,139
Come on.

3562
03:30:39,139 --> 03:30:42,100
Are we going to get everybody standing up on the high ground here?

3563
03:30:44,260 --> 03:30:44,500
What?

3564
03:30:44,500 --> 03:30:46,659
In GTA, you never ran over a pedestrian before?

3565
03:30:47,620 --> 03:30:48,659
Of course not.

3566
03:30:48,659 --> 03:30:51,700
I stopped at every red light and I used my turn signal.

3567
03:30:52,579 --> 03:30:54,340
It's the funerals, Tom.

3568
03:30:54,340 --> 03:30:55,379
That's all it ever.

3569
03:30:56,389 --> 03:30:56,950
Not me.

3570
03:30:56,950 --> 03:30:58,069
No, of course not.

3571
03:30:58,069 --> 03:31:01,590
Anyone ever wants to do is point guns at the family and shoot.

3572
03:31:01,590 --> 03:31:03,350
In point, there were so many funerals.

3573
03:31:03,350 --> 03:31:04,229
I actually do.

3574
03:31:04,790 --> 03:31:09,200
That's how you make GTA, like, a 500-hour game.

3575
03:31:09,200 --> 03:31:10,319
That's a shame.

3576
03:31:10,319 --> 03:31:12,719
Seen as you're always dressed for the occasion.

3577
03:31:12,719 --> 03:31:13,680
Great gag, Tom.

3578
03:31:14,399 --> 03:31:15,360
Write that one down.

3579
03:31:16,079 --> 03:31:16,479
Thanks.

3580
03:31:17,120 --> 03:31:17,840
I'll do that.

3581
03:31:20,559 --> 03:31:21,840
Say that in court, German.

3582
03:31:22,639 --> 03:31:25,079
Here's your stuff.

3583
03:31:26,209 --> 03:31:27,250
But stand up and be like, what?

3584
03:31:27,250 --> 03:31:28,290
You're never in GTA.

3585
03:31:28,290 --> 03:31:29,250
You're in the family.

3586
03:31:29,250 --> 03:31:31,190
Good luck.

3587
03:31:31,190 --> 03:31:31,909
You too.

3588
03:31:31,909 --> 03:31:33,430
Yeah, I would be my own defense.

3589
03:31:33,989 --> 03:31:36,950
Your Honor, in Grand Theft Auto, you can run over people.

3590
03:31:39,670 --> 03:31:40,790
You never done that before, Judge?

3591
03:31:42,719 --> 03:31:47,760
You never ran over an old lady in the crosswalk in GTA?

3592
03:31:48,479 --> 03:31:54,719
Maybe we'd get flustered.

3593
03:31:54,719 --> 03:31:57,840
But well, case dismissed.

3594
03:32:10,819 --> 03:32:11,379
Please.

3595
03:32:11,379 --> 03:32:11,700
OK.

3596
03:32:12,420 --> 03:32:19,409
I didn't say I didn't do it.

3597
03:32:19,409 --> 03:32:19,969
See?

3598
03:32:19,969 --> 03:32:20,930
It was not necessary.

3599
03:32:20,930 --> 03:32:21,569
I didn't have to do it.

3600
03:32:21,569 --> 03:32:22,450
There was no reason to do that.

3601
03:32:23,170 --> 03:32:25,030
I was trying to get out of the way.

3602
03:32:25,670 --> 03:32:39,030
Enter the hotel.

3603
03:32:39,670 --> 03:32:45,860
I have a bomb, don't I?

3604
03:32:47,219 --> 03:32:47,860
Oh, shit.

3605
03:32:47,860 --> 03:32:48,659
Do I have to get searched?

3606
03:32:49,780 --> 03:32:52,129
Send a message from Don Salieri.

3607
03:32:52,129 --> 03:32:52,770
Find Michelle.

3608
03:32:52,770 --> 03:32:53,889
Find the manager.

3609
03:32:53,889 --> 03:32:55,569
Know where I can find the manager?

3610
03:32:55,569 --> 03:32:57,170
I just watched the door, pal.

3611
03:32:57,170 --> 03:33:08,319
Nobody cares.

3612
03:33:09,200 --> 03:33:10,000
OK.

3613
03:33:10,000 --> 03:33:10,719
Find Michelle.

3614
03:33:13,090 --> 03:33:14,049
Hey, handsome.

3615
03:33:14,049 --> 03:33:15,090
You know where I can find Michelle?

3616
03:33:21,889 --> 03:33:24,290
And I got some business with your manager, too.

3617
03:33:24,290 --> 03:33:25,090
A girl?

3618
03:33:25,090 --> 03:33:27,360
I can help you with that.

3619
03:33:27,360 --> 03:33:27,600
Wait.

3620
03:33:27,600 --> 03:33:28,079
Hold on.

3621
03:33:28,079 --> 03:33:28,959
Somebody had a gun.

3622
03:33:29,760 --> 03:33:33,940
Get that away.

3623
03:33:34,500 --> 03:33:36,260
Oh, shit.

3624
03:33:36,260 --> 03:33:36,500
OK.

3625
03:33:36,500 --> 03:33:36,979
He's hidden.

3626
03:33:44,600 --> 03:33:45,319
Find Michelle.

3627
03:33:51,030 --> 03:33:51,350
Michelle.

3628
03:33:51,350 --> 03:33:53,110
Because you're not the dame I'm after.

3629
03:33:53,110 --> 03:33:54,360
No, Michelle.

3630
03:33:54,360 --> 03:33:55,239
I'm new here, baby.

3631
03:33:55,239 --> 03:33:55,879
I don't know a thing.

3632
03:33:55,879 --> 03:33:58,200
Why don't you just walk up to everybody and say, Michelle?

3633
03:33:59,079 --> 03:34:00,280
No, Michelle.

3634
03:34:00,280 --> 03:34:01,079
No, Michelle.

3635
03:34:01,079 --> 03:34:01,399
Yes?

3636
03:34:02,200 --> 03:34:03,799
Or just yell, Michelle.

3637
03:34:04,760 --> 03:34:05,639
Somebody's head's going to turn.

3638
03:34:05,639 --> 03:34:06,360
Yeah, what?

3639
03:34:06,360 --> 03:34:07,799
Hey, I need you.

3640
03:34:07,799 --> 03:34:09,079
I need to speak to Michelle.

3641
03:34:16,479 --> 03:34:19,440
We can just talk if you don't want anything else.

3642
03:34:20,719 --> 03:34:24,559
What's a handsome man like you doing in a place like this?

3643
03:34:24,559 --> 03:34:26,719
Looking for a girl named Michelle.

3644
03:34:26,719 --> 03:34:29,360
She's busy upstairs, but I need to...

3645
03:34:29,360 --> 03:34:30,239
That's all I needed to know?

3646
03:34:31,040 --> 03:34:34,229
Can I get a drink?

3647
03:34:35,750 --> 03:34:37,110
I need to talk to the manager.

3648
03:34:37,110 --> 03:34:37,909
Look at that droid.

3649
03:34:37,909 --> 03:34:39,719
...straight through the lab.

3650
03:34:39,719 --> 03:34:42,840
Yeah, I'll take a large espresso from the Golden R2-D2, please.

3651
03:34:42,840 --> 03:34:50,579
All right, let's just go upstairs and find Michelle.

3652
03:34:50,579 --> 03:34:55,000
You're looking for a good time in this way, sweetie.

3653
03:34:55,000 --> 03:34:55,500
Michelle?

3654
03:34:56,040 --> 03:34:58,770
Michelle.

3655
03:34:58,770 --> 03:34:59,969
Sure, y'all.

3656
03:34:59,969 --> 03:35:02,129
Come to my room and tell me all about it.

3657
03:35:02,770 --> 03:35:03,889
Uh, okay.

3658
03:35:03,889 --> 03:35:05,329
I just want to talk.

3659
03:35:05,329 --> 03:35:07,569
You know, I get to hear that a lot.

3660
03:35:07,569 --> 03:35:11,010
I bet you're not like all the other guys either, are you?

3661
03:35:11,010 --> 03:35:12,370
Nah, not really.

3662
03:35:14,639 --> 03:35:16,719
Okay, kill the manager in the lounge.

3663
03:35:16,719 --> 03:35:17,920
Why did this become Hitman?

3664
03:35:25,219 --> 03:35:25,540
What?

3665
03:35:25,540 --> 03:35:26,579
Whose room is this?

3666
03:35:26,579 --> 03:35:28,309
Hey, put you in your place.

3667
03:35:28,309 --> 03:35:29,350
You know Michelle.

3668
03:35:29,350 --> 03:35:30,549
She's in 208!

3669
03:35:30,549 --> 03:35:31,030
Get out!

3670
03:35:31,590 --> 03:35:33,680
Sorry for the intrusion.

3671
03:35:33,680 --> 03:35:35,040
It was that easy.

3672
03:35:35,040 --> 03:35:38,879
Okay, 208.

3673
03:35:38,879 --> 03:35:40,479
I don't even need you anymore.

3674
03:35:40,479 --> 03:35:41,670
Where's 208?

3675
03:35:42,229 --> 03:35:48,930
This is 101.

3676
03:35:48,930 --> 03:35:49,889
I don't even need to be in here.

3677
03:35:49,889 --> 03:35:50,290
What am I...

3678
03:35:50,290 --> 03:35:52,209
No, this lady's gonna poison me.

3679
03:35:52,209 --> 03:35:53,559
I'm gonna say she's gonna poison me.

3680
03:35:53,559 --> 03:35:53,959
I know it.

3681
03:35:54,520 --> 03:35:56,440
I guarantee this lady poisons me.

3682
03:35:56,440 --> 03:35:59,440
You're gonna poison me!

3683
03:36:06,399 --> 03:36:08,479
I know I'm gonna get poisoned, I swear to God.

3684
03:36:08,479 --> 03:36:18,209
Is this 208?

3685
03:36:18,209 --> 03:36:28,100
What's in here?

3686
03:36:33,840 --> 03:36:35,680
Everybody is a threat right now.

3687
03:36:35,680 --> 03:36:37,280
It doesn't matter.

3688
03:36:38,000 --> 03:36:39,299
People are gonna kill you.

3689
03:36:39,299 --> 03:36:39,780
They have guns.

3690
03:36:39,780 --> 03:36:40,500
They have knives.

3691
03:36:40,500 --> 03:36:41,700
I'm protecting myself.

3692
03:36:51,729 --> 03:36:52,290
Psycho.

3693
03:36:58,899 --> 03:36:59,219
See?

3694
03:36:59,219 --> 03:37:00,180
Everyone's a fucking threat.

3695
03:37:00,180 --> 03:37:00,979
Look at these threats.

3696
03:37:00,979 --> 03:37:01,620
I'm telling you.

3697
03:37:07,620 --> 03:37:08,420
Wait, who's who?

3698
03:37:10,020 --> 03:37:11,459
Wait, is this a bad guy?

3699
03:37:11,459 --> 03:37:12,260
Who's the bad guy?

3700
03:37:12,979 --> 03:37:16,049
I don't know.

3701
03:37:16,049 --> 03:37:17,010
I don't know which one was the bad guy.

3702
03:37:17,010 --> 03:37:17,489
I have no idea.

3703
03:37:18,479 --> 03:37:19,120
Okay, easy.

3704
03:37:20,000 --> 03:37:21,139
Do you know where Michelle is?

3705
03:37:22,739 --> 03:37:36,920
You're the bad guy on my chest.

3706
03:37:37,479 --> 03:37:39,620
All right, I need to go up.

3707
03:37:39,620 --> 03:37:42,260
Where's the staircase?

3708
03:37:42,260 --> 03:37:45,940
Why is nobody getting me in trouble for doing these crazy things?

3709
03:37:46,500 --> 03:37:56,920
2-0.

3710
03:37:56,920 --> 03:37:57,319
Where is it?

3711
03:38:11,000 --> 03:38:11,479
Bible?

3712
03:38:11,479 --> 03:38:12,370
No.

3713
03:38:12,370 --> 03:38:12,770
Shoes?

3714
03:38:12,770 --> 03:38:13,010
No.

3715
03:38:13,649 --> 03:38:14,370
Car down there.

3716
03:38:16,530 --> 03:38:17,090
Can I change?

3717
03:38:21,459 --> 03:38:22,260
Oh, 2-0-2.

3718
03:38:22,260 --> 03:38:22,659
Wait, wait, wait.

3719
03:38:22,659 --> 03:38:24,870
What's this?

3720
03:38:24,870 --> 03:38:25,430
Yeah, 2-0-2.

3721
03:38:25,430 --> 03:38:26,069
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3722
03:38:26,069 --> 03:38:27,190
Find Michelle on 2-0-8.

3723
03:38:27,829 --> 03:38:28,389
2-10.

3724
03:38:28,389 --> 03:38:28,950
Where's 2-0-8?

3725
03:38:29,510 --> 03:38:31,139
2-0-1.

3726
03:38:37,969 --> 03:38:38,930
2-0-9.

3727
03:38:38,930 --> 03:38:39,170
Okay.

3728
03:38:40,959 --> 03:38:42,239
2-0-8.

3729
03:38:42,239 --> 03:38:43,200
Oh, it's just on the...

3730
03:38:43,200 --> 03:38:43,840
Okay.

3731
03:38:43,840 --> 03:38:45,520
This is where I have to be.

3732
03:38:45,520 --> 03:38:46,319
Should I knock on the door?

3733
03:38:58,500 --> 03:38:59,139
You, Michelle.

3734
03:38:59,139 --> 03:39:00,500
What's it to you?

3735
03:39:00,500 --> 03:39:02,739
A fella named Sam is one of your regulars.

3736
03:39:02,739 --> 03:39:04,420
Maybe there's a lot of guys named Sam.

3737
03:39:04,420 --> 03:39:05,379
You know him.

3738
03:39:05,379 --> 03:39:07,299
Works for Don Celieri.

3739
03:39:07,299 --> 03:39:08,819
Maybe you got him talking about...

3740
03:39:08,819 --> 03:39:09,219
Excuse me.

3741
03:39:09,219 --> 03:39:10,180
Do you know where Michelle is?

3742
03:39:11,299 --> 03:39:14,020
Don Morello offered you some money to spill what you heard.

3743
03:39:14,020 --> 03:39:14,420
No.

3744
03:39:14,420 --> 03:39:15,219
Sam, trust me.

3745
03:39:15,780 --> 03:39:16,659
I don't say nothing.

3746
03:39:16,659 --> 03:39:17,139
He knows that.

3747
03:39:17,139 --> 03:39:21,940
Well, the Don's losing a lot of money because someone can't keep their mouth shut.

3748
03:39:21,940 --> 03:39:22,440
Hey.

3749
03:39:38,739 --> 03:39:39,780
I didn't kill everybody.

3750
03:39:40,340 --> 03:39:44,209
The first lady I thought was gonna...

3751
03:39:44,209 --> 03:39:46,850
The door was gonna close and she was gonna stab me or poison me or something.

3752
03:39:49,280 --> 03:39:49,840
Second room.

3753
03:39:50,879 --> 03:39:51,680
There's two guys in there.

3754
03:39:51,680 --> 03:39:52,239
One of them was beaten.

3755
03:39:52,239 --> 03:39:52,879
One of them I choked.

3756
03:39:52,879 --> 03:39:53,200
One of them.

3757
03:39:53,200 --> 03:39:54,079
Then I punched the other guy.

3758
03:39:54,079 --> 03:39:56,479
Because if you ever show your face in this town again,

3759
03:39:56,479 --> 03:39:58,079
they're gonna find you with two in the head.

3760
03:40:00,549 --> 03:40:01,510
Do you understand?

3761
03:40:02,469 --> 03:40:08,680
What about the security guard?

3762
03:40:08,680 --> 03:40:09,719
Yeah, that's true.

3763
03:40:11,110 --> 03:40:11,829
I can't, uh...

3764
03:40:11,829 --> 03:40:13,110
Get dressed and make tracks.

3765
03:40:13,110 --> 03:40:14,549
I have no excuse for the security guard.

3766
03:40:14,549 --> 03:40:15,270
I just kind of did it.

3767
03:40:15,750 --> 03:40:23,540
Just don't come back and we're square.

3768
03:40:24,579 --> 03:40:34,069
All right.

3769
03:40:34,069 --> 03:40:36,690
We're good.

3770
03:40:36,690 --> 03:40:38,129
Kill the manager in the lounge.

3771
03:40:40,709 --> 03:40:44,049
Killing everybody besides the manager in the lounge.

3772
03:40:44,049 --> 03:40:45,010
Don't I have a bomb?

3773
03:40:45,569 --> 03:40:58,239
Back downstairs.

3774
03:40:58,799 --> 03:41:07,879
Oh, it's okay.

3775
03:41:07,879 --> 03:41:08,920
Someone's just jumping on the bed.

3776
03:41:22,709 --> 03:41:23,190
Psycho.

3777
03:41:30,440 --> 03:41:31,000
All right.

3778
03:41:31,000 --> 03:41:34,819
Don't hurt anybody.

3779
03:41:34,819 --> 03:41:36,850
There he is.

3780
03:41:36,850 --> 03:41:37,170
All right.

3781
03:41:37,170 --> 03:41:38,049
How do I kill this guy?

3782
03:41:41,219 --> 03:41:43,940
I guess I just go walk up and put my hands on his neck.

3783
03:41:43,940 --> 03:41:45,059
But I don't think that's gonna work.

3784
03:41:53,860 --> 03:41:54,500
Can I talk to him?

3785
03:42:01,909 --> 03:42:06,180
No, this is gonna be some weird hitman thing to do with this.

3786
03:42:06,180 --> 03:42:08,389
I'm gonna drop a chandelier on him or something, right?

3787
03:42:16,479 --> 03:42:16,879
Poison?

3788
03:42:18,069 --> 03:42:20,149
Why do I think there's poison in this game?

3789
03:42:20,149 --> 03:42:21,670
It's not showing up at all.

3790
03:42:22,549 --> 03:42:24,229
Why did I think I was gonna get poisoned?

3791
03:42:24,870 --> 03:42:26,959
Like, here, have a drink.

3792
03:42:26,959 --> 03:42:27,760
And I was gonna die.

3793
03:42:27,760 --> 03:42:29,040
Why did I think that was gonna happen?

3794
03:42:29,680 --> 03:42:36,870
I actually just have to kill this guy, I guess.

3795
03:42:39,139 --> 03:42:39,379
Uh...

3796
03:42:39,940 --> 03:42:49,239
Oh, he'll go to the bathroom.

3797
03:42:50,200 --> 03:42:51,319
He's gonna go to the bathroom eventually.

3798
03:42:51,319 --> 03:42:53,159
And we'll just chuck him out of the bathroom.

3799
03:43:03,799 --> 03:43:04,200
Shoot him.

3800
03:43:05,600 --> 03:43:07,040
No, I don't want to shoot him.

3801
03:43:07,040 --> 03:43:08,479
Why is there blood all over the place?

3802
03:43:11,600 --> 03:43:12,559
Oh, it's me.

3803
03:43:21,079 --> 03:43:21,879
He's not gonna move.

3804
03:43:21,879 --> 03:43:22,680
Just shoot him.

3805
03:43:23,239 --> 03:43:25,319
Everyone called me a psycho when I punched that lady

3806
03:43:25,319 --> 03:43:27,079
and when I choked that guy to death.

3807
03:43:27,079 --> 03:43:28,520
I don't want to be the psycho anymore.

3808
03:43:28,520 --> 03:43:38,840
I want to do the correct way.

3809
03:43:38,840 --> 03:43:39,879
Run, run, run, run, run!

3810
03:43:44,000 --> 03:43:44,319
Run!

3811
03:43:45,909 --> 03:43:47,829
I don't know if that's a good...

3812
03:43:47,829 --> 03:43:48,790
I don't know if that's a bad guy or not.

3813
03:43:49,670 --> 03:43:51,190
Reach the manager's office?

3814
03:43:51,190 --> 03:43:51,430
What?

3815
03:44:04,260 --> 03:44:04,819
What's the go...

3816
03:44:06,340 --> 03:44:12,159
I don't want to be the psycho.

3817
03:44:12,159 --> 03:44:12,559
I wasn't.

3818
03:44:12,559 --> 03:44:14,000
I was running away.

3819
03:44:14,000 --> 03:44:15,600
I did what I had to do and I ran away.

3820
03:44:16,319 --> 03:44:19,000
What is happening?

3821
03:44:19,000 --> 03:44:19,239
Oh.

3822
03:44:19,959 --> 03:44:21,569
I don't want to...

3823
03:44:25,590 --> 03:44:26,229
Um...

3824
03:44:26,229 --> 03:44:31,860
Don't listen to chat.

3825
03:44:31,860 --> 03:44:33,459
Just go and reach the manager's office.

3826
03:44:34,180 --> 03:44:35,079
This guy...

3827
03:44:35,079 --> 03:44:38,120
Okay, like the concierge just ran in with a shotgun.

3828
03:44:38,120 --> 03:44:40,360
And you're telling me that not everybody here was a threat?

3829
03:44:40,360 --> 03:44:42,549
That was the bellhop.

3830
03:44:42,549 --> 03:45:01,090
I gotta go, uh, game mode for this one.

3831
03:45:01,809 --> 03:45:13,780
All right, reach the manager's office.

3832
03:45:13,780 --> 03:45:14,100
Let's go.

3833
03:45:14,739 --> 03:45:18,420
I'll take the shotgun.

3834
03:45:19,059 --> 03:45:19,780
Oh, hell yeah.

3835
03:45:19,780 --> 03:45:20,739
All right, let's go reload this.

3836
03:45:32,520 --> 03:45:33,079
Oh, shit.

3837
03:45:33,079 --> 03:45:33,559
Where is he?

3838
03:45:34,120 --> 03:45:40,760
Oh, give me the...

3839
03:45:41,319 --> 03:45:53,350
Oh, yourself.

3840
03:45:53,350 --> 03:45:55,510
Neither one of us knows who we're aiming at right now.

3841
03:45:55,510 --> 03:46:09,090
Is there a heal?

3842
03:46:09,090 --> 03:46:10,209
There's no heal box, is there?

3843
03:46:15,569 --> 03:46:15,889
Where?

3844
03:46:16,450 --> 03:46:26,040
Oh, back in the kitchen?

3845
03:46:26,600 --> 03:46:32,280
I don't...

3846
03:46:32,280 --> 03:46:38,280
Where?

3847
03:46:38,280 --> 03:46:38,680
Sick.

3848
03:46:38,680 --> 03:46:39,000
Thank you.

3849
03:46:43,479 --> 03:46:44,120
There we go.

3850
03:46:44,120 --> 03:46:46,040
Now I got tons of ammo for the shotgun.

3851
03:46:46,040 --> 03:46:46,360
We're good.

3852
03:47:07,399 --> 03:47:09,159
I just like skimmed him.

3853
03:47:09,159 --> 03:47:22,389
Nobody left, all right?

3854
03:47:22,389 --> 03:47:29,090
I have no idea.

3855
03:47:30,209 --> 03:47:31,010
Oh, my goodness.

3856
03:47:40,069 --> 03:47:40,950
Everybody's a threat.

3857
03:47:41,510 --> 03:47:42,549
Everybody's a threat.

3858
03:47:43,440 --> 03:47:44,559
Even the naked guy.

3859
03:47:59,620 --> 03:48:00,100
Whoa!

3860
03:48:00,899 --> 03:48:19,159
Where is he?

3861
03:48:19,159 --> 03:48:27,649
Any health in here?

3862
03:48:27,649 --> 03:48:31,010
Oh, shit.

3863
03:48:43,780 --> 03:48:51,000
Remember, this is not a kill everyone scenario.

3864
03:48:51,000 --> 03:48:52,520
This is a get out scenario.

3865
03:48:52,520 --> 03:48:54,790
All right, that's cool.

3866
03:48:54,870 --> 03:49:03,780
Just run.

3867
03:49:03,780 --> 03:49:05,860
Your game reward is causing lag.

3868
03:49:05,860 --> 03:49:31,379
Where's his office?

3869
03:49:35,920 --> 03:49:36,959
I was right there.

3870
03:49:36,959 --> 03:49:37,600
Shit.

3871
03:49:37,600 --> 03:49:43,860
Oh, god damn it.

3872
03:49:43,860 --> 03:49:45,680
That was so close.

3873
03:49:45,680 --> 03:49:49,219
It actually worked for a minute.

3874
03:49:49,219 --> 03:49:53,010
Why are you playing with a controller?

3875
03:49:53,010 --> 03:49:54,850
Because my game reward's gonna get in the way

3876
03:49:54,850 --> 03:49:56,450
and it's gonna hurt if I press W.

3877
03:49:56,450 --> 03:49:57,569
Because when I press W,

3878
03:49:57,569 --> 03:50:00,229
it's gonna scrape against the E key.

3879
03:50:00,229 --> 03:50:02,069
I mean, the mouse.

3880
03:50:02,069 --> 03:50:02,629
The mouse...

3881
03:50:02,629 --> 03:50:03,350
No, it's not even...

3882
03:50:03,350 --> 03:50:04,229
That's a wrong hand.

3883
03:50:04,870 --> 03:50:17,860
I got a checkpoint, though.

3884
03:50:17,860 --> 03:50:21,760
Somebody else shot him in the head, not me.

3885
03:50:22,399 --> 03:50:38,290
Oh, shit.

3886
03:50:38,290 --> 03:50:51,510
Into the hallway, that's it.

3887
03:50:51,510 --> 03:50:52,790
I'm just gonna get to the end of the hallway.

3888
03:50:52,790 --> 03:51:12,399
I was doing like covering fire.

3889
03:51:12,399 --> 03:51:14,020
There's another guy right there.

3890
03:51:14,020 --> 03:51:25,399
Jesus, that's why I don't want to run.

3891
03:51:26,040 --> 03:51:33,159
Did I shoot myself in the side of the head?

3892
03:51:33,159 --> 03:51:41,030
Did I lean forward to peek and then shoot myself?

3893
03:51:41,030 --> 03:52:06,950
Dude, give me a fucking break.

3894
03:52:06,950 --> 03:52:08,790
Where is this guy shooting at me from?

3895
03:52:08,790 --> 03:52:20,319
Shit, that was a loud yell.

3896
03:52:20,319 --> 03:52:32,260
He did not fucking hit me.

3897
03:52:32,260 --> 03:52:48,159
I'm just saying bullshit.

3898
03:52:48,159 --> 03:52:49,280
I had explosive right here.

3899
03:52:49,280 --> 03:52:49,780
Ready?

3900
03:52:54,200 --> 03:52:57,139
Fucking come on.

3901
03:52:57,139 --> 03:53:08,690
It's lower the difficulty to regular.

3902
03:53:08,690 --> 03:53:10,129
Don't be on classic mode.

3903
03:53:10,129 --> 03:53:12,159
I'm not gonna put it...

3904
03:53:12,159 --> 03:53:13,600
No, I can't do that more than once.

3905
03:53:13,600 --> 03:53:22,920
You know why I hate video games so much?

3906
03:53:23,000 --> 03:53:26,680
Because you have to put your mouse sensitivity

3907
03:53:26,680 --> 03:53:29,239
down to like 0.5 in every fucking video game.

3908
03:53:29,239 --> 03:53:29,799
Do you guys realize?

3909
03:53:29,799 --> 03:53:30,440
Do you guys notice that?

3910
03:53:30,440 --> 03:53:31,319
Who the fuck play...

3911
03:53:31,319 --> 03:53:35,489
Why would they ever have a like 5.0 sensitivity?

3912
03:53:35,489 --> 03:53:37,809
What's the point of having that even be an option?

3913
03:53:37,809 --> 03:53:48,309
It's a little too low.

3914
03:53:48,309 --> 03:54:04,520
Why does this feel so laggy?

3915
03:54:05,239 --> 03:54:08,639
I think it's because it is.

3916
03:54:09,200 --> 03:54:32,690
All right, the same stupid...

3917
03:54:32,690 --> 03:54:38,360
Get up.

3918
03:54:38,360 --> 03:54:39,239
It's gonna explode.

3919
03:54:39,239 --> 03:54:40,440
Just get rid of it first.

3920
03:54:40,440 --> 03:54:42,239
Someone's gonna shoot that.

3921
03:54:42,239 --> 03:54:42,879
It's gonna kill me.

3922
03:54:43,520 --> 03:54:53,329
That's just ducking in plain sight.

3923
03:54:53,329 --> 03:54:54,530
The controller was sitting on my lap.

3924
03:54:54,530 --> 03:54:55,729
I put it on the desk.

3925
03:54:55,729 --> 03:55:05,569
Turn on aim assist.

3926
03:55:05,569 --> 03:55:07,090
Wouldn't I want to turn it off?

3927
03:55:07,090 --> 03:55:14,639
Is it like pulling me over to other enemies?

3928
03:55:14,639 --> 03:55:31,409
Fucking die!

3929
03:55:32,129 --> 03:55:40,930
Game's at...

3930
03:55:40,930 --> 03:55:41,489
It's bugged.

3931
03:55:41,489 --> 03:55:42,610
Turn on v-sync.

3932
03:55:42,610 --> 03:55:43,090
I don't think...

3933
03:55:43,090 --> 03:55:43,809
Is that real?

3934
03:55:43,809 --> 03:55:48,500
I don't think that's real.

3935
03:55:49,059 --> 03:55:51,489
You're alive?

3936
03:55:52,129 --> 03:55:58,260
You gotta turn vegetation on...

3937
03:55:58,260 --> 03:55:59,059
All right, this...

3938
03:55:59,059 --> 03:56:00,420
Same fucking doorway.

3939
03:56:05,200 --> 03:56:08,950
There he is.

3940
03:56:08,950 --> 03:56:10,629
You can't be serious.

3941
03:56:10,629 --> 03:56:11,270
Same guy.

3942
03:56:11,270 --> 03:56:16,680
He shoots me in the head every time.

3943
03:56:16,680 --> 03:56:19,159
Why is this guy so impossible for me to kill?

3944
03:56:19,159 --> 03:56:37,879
I shot him right in the neck.

3945
03:56:37,879 --> 03:56:38,440
What was that?

3946
03:56:43,989 --> 03:56:45,510
Oh my fucking God.

3947
03:56:45,510 --> 03:56:46,469
Why is it like this?

3948
03:57:12,340 --> 03:57:14,100
Here's the gamer instinct.

3949
03:57:14,100 --> 03:57:19,829
Oh my fucking God.

3950
03:57:19,829 --> 03:57:20,469
Are you...

3951
03:57:20,469 --> 03:57:21,350
Are you kidding me?

3952
03:57:21,350 --> 03:57:24,389
Because I replaced my gun in the beginning of the level

3953
03:57:24,389 --> 03:57:26,549
when I choked out the fucking bellhop

3954
03:57:26,549 --> 03:57:35,139
and I took the shitty gun.

3955
03:57:35,139 --> 03:57:35,540
Really?

3956
03:57:36,479 --> 03:57:37,360
Really?

3957
03:57:37,360 --> 03:57:37,760
No.

3958
03:57:37,760 --> 03:57:39,120
All right, I gotta replace this gun.

3959
03:57:39,760 --> 03:57:45,379
This thing sucks.

3960
03:57:45,379 --> 03:57:46,979
I'm like shooting BBs at these guys.

3961
03:57:47,620 --> 03:57:51,329
Give me your gun.

3962
03:57:51,329 --> 03:57:53,079
What do you have?

3963
03:57:53,079 --> 03:57:53,479
Thank you.

3964
03:57:53,479 --> 03:57:54,280
Oh my God.

3965
03:57:56,549 --> 03:57:57,829
What the hell was I thinking?

3966
03:57:58,709 --> 03:58:00,079
What was I doing?

3967
03:58:00,079 --> 03:58:00,959
What was wrong with me?

3968
03:58:20,040 --> 03:58:20,760
What are you doing?

3969
03:58:21,239 --> 03:58:27,860
The guy in the hat.

3970
03:58:32,799 --> 03:58:33,600
This guy's in my head.

3971
03:58:34,159 --> 03:58:35,840
This dude is in my head so bad.

3972
03:58:35,840 --> 03:58:36,319
He really is.

3973
03:58:41,079 --> 03:58:41,319
Yeah.

3974
03:58:42,040 --> 03:58:43,000
I shot that guy.

3975
03:58:43,000 --> 03:58:43,319
Okay.

3976
03:58:43,319 --> 03:58:43,879
I don't even know what happened.

3977
03:58:43,879 --> 03:58:44,760
That guy exploded.

3978
03:58:56,739 --> 03:58:57,379
No, don't.

3979
03:59:01,760 --> 03:59:02,559
Use your grenades.

3980
03:59:02,559 --> 03:59:03,920
I don't have any grenades.

3981
03:59:03,920 --> 03:59:12,799
Get up.

3982
03:59:12,799 --> 03:59:13,040
Shit.

3983
03:59:13,600 --> 03:59:24,200
Come on, dude.

3984
03:59:24,200 --> 03:59:27,489
I don't have any bullets.

3985
03:59:27,489 --> 03:59:28,049
Oh shit.

3986
03:59:28,049 --> 03:59:28,610
Give me the controller.

3987
03:59:28,610 --> 03:59:29,569
I don't know what to do.

3988
03:59:29,569 --> 03:59:31,270
Do I have anything else?

3989
03:59:31,270 --> 03:59:38,610
Give me another gun.

3990
03:59:38,610 --> 03:59:39,409
Give me a gun.

3991
03:59:39,409 --> 03:59:45,840
No.

3992
03:59:45,840 --> 04:00:07,079
There's one more guy.

3993
04:00:08,440 --> 04:00:17,590
There's no bullets in any of these guns.

3994
04:00:27,139 --> 04:00:28,819
What are you doing?

3995
04:00:28,819 --> 04:00:35,350
I don't even know where he is.

3996
04:00:35,829 --> 04:00:52,209
Where is he?

3997
04:00:52,209 --> 04:00:52,770
Holy shit.

3998
04:00:52,770 --> 04:00:53,489
What an idiot.

3999
04:00:53,489 --> 04:00:58,239
Get the safe.

4000
04:00:58,239 --> 04:01:03,030
I'll take this one for sure.

4001
04:01:03,030 --> 04:01:04,309
This is a sawed-off shotgun.

4002
04:01:04,309 --> 04:01:25,190
Why does this guy have a spotlight all over him?

4003
04:01:26,790 --> 04:01:27,750
Can I get him out?

4004
04:01:27,750 --> 04:01:30,229
Clown?

4005
04:01:30,229 --> 04:01:35,430
No, I'm not going to kill this guy.

4006
04:01:35,430 --> 04:01:36,149
Okay?

4007
04:01:36,149 --> 04:01:38,309
I am not going to do that.

4008
04:01:38,309 --> 04:01:39,649
I've done enough.

4009
04:01:39,649 --> 04:01:43,010
I've done enough like punching and fighting and shooting and stuff.

4010
04:01:43,010 --> 04:01:44,209
I'm not going to do it.

4011
04:01:44,209 --> 04:01:45,010
Not going to happen.

4012
04:01:45,010 --> 04:01:48,559
Not right now.

4013
04:01:48,559 --> 04:01:49,360
Shoot the chair.

4014
04:01:49,360 --> 04:01:49,680
All right.

4015
04:01:49,680 --> 04:01:51,120
I might shoot the chair.

4016
04:01:51,920 --> 04:02:01,729
Can I shoot the chair without killing him?

4017
04:02:01,729 --> 04:02:03,489
You're going to blow up the what?

4018
04:02:03,489 --> 04:02:05,600
Oh wait.

4019
04:02:05,600 --> 04:02:06,319
This guy's...

4020
04:02:06,319 --> 04:02:06,479
Yeah.

4021
04:02:06,479 --> 04:02:07,040
How do I...

4022
04:02:07,360 --> 04:02:08,479
I'm going to blow up the whole building?

4023
04:02:09,120 --> 04:02:16,579
Take money and documents.

4024
04:02:16,579 --> 04:02:17,139
Okay?

4025
04:02:17,139 --> 04:02:23,170
Get that document.

4026
04:02:23,170 --> 04:02:23,809
Money.

4027
04:02:23,809 --> 04:02:25,280
Documents.

4028
04:02:25,280 --> 04:02:30,760
Land the bomb.

4029
04:02:30,760 --> 04:02:31,889
Does it matter where?

4030
04:02:31,889 --> 04:02:39,379
That clown guy really is just kind of still in there.

4031
04:02:39,379 --> 04:03:02,370
He's just tied up.

4032
04:03:02,370 --> 04:03:17,040
Okay.

4033
04:03:17,040 --> 04:03:18,319
I blew out an office.

4034
04:03:18,319 --> 04:03:20,719
I didn't blow up the building.

4035
04:03:20,719 --> 04:03:26,500
Oh, we're good.

4036
04:03:26,500 --> 04:03:28,149
Get to the roof?

4037
04:03:28,950 --> 04:03:43,270
Are those police shooting at me?

4038
04:03:43,270 --> 04:03:55,139
Why does it look like my body was on backwards?

4039
04:03:55,139 --> 04:04:08,159
Can I find a way up to the roof?

4040
04:04:09,860 --> 04:04:15,270
All right.

4041
04:04:15,270 --> 04:04:16,870
But where are they actually shooting?

4042
04:04:16,870 --> 04:04:26,930
I don't think I can get rid of these guys.

4043
04:04:26,930 --> 04:04:34,840
I have a shotgun that I'm going to shoot into windows

4044
04:04:34,840 --> 04:04:37,280
that are like 500 feet away from me.

4045
04:04:58,340 --> 04:05:00,739
Restart chapter.

4046
04:05:00,739 --> 04:05:02,100
Oh my goodness.

4047
04:05:02,100 --> 04:05:14,149
I am going to have to just run.

4048
04:05:14,149 --> 04:05:14,549
Slow down.

4049
04:05:14,549 --> 04:05:15,270
Go, go, go, go, go.

4050
04:05:15,909 --> 04:05:28,770
What difficulty is this?

4051
04:05:28,770 --> 04:05:29,569
Classic.

4052
04:05:29,569 --> 04:05:35,200
Hide and just heal.

4053
04:05:35,200 --> 04:05:51,010
Do I have any other guns?

4054
04:05:51,010 --> 04:05:51,889
I don't.

4055
04:05:51,889 --> 04:05:54,610
I just have a stupid shotgun, man.

4056
04:05:55,329 --> 04:06:16,040
I can get them.

4057
04:06:16,040 --> 04:06:16,520
Oh, shit.

4058
04:06:17,159 --> 04:06:22,020
I get them?

4059
04:06:22,020 --> 04:06:22,739
I got them.

4060
04:06:22,739 --> 04:06:24,399
Go, go!

4061
04:06:24,399 --> 04:06:25,520
While they're distracted while they're shot.

4062
04:06:26,079 --> 04:06:41,600
I'm in trouble now.

4063
04:06:41,600 --> 04:06:45,889
Why did I switch to the dumb shotgun?

4064
04:06:46,450 --> 04:06:47,489
Because it was on the ground

4065
04:06:47,489 --> 04:06:49,010
and I thought it might be fun to use.

4066
04:06:53,569 --> 04:06:53,969
All right.

4067
04:06:54,690 --> 04:06:59,250
What am I going to do?

4068
04:07:06,870 --> 04:07:08,149
I think I have to kill these guys.

4069
04:07:14,079 --> 04:07:19,270
Are they gone?

4070
04:07:19,270 --> 04:07:20,229
I saw the guy in the eye.

4071
04:07:20,229 --> 04:07:21,190
That guy doesn't have an eye.

4072
04:07:21,829 --> 04:07:22,370
All right.

4073
04:07:22,370 --> 04:07:22,850
One's dead.

4074
04:07:23,489 --> 04:07:24,209
One of them is dead.

4075
04:07:24,850 --> 04:07:31,649
This is my actual opportunity here.

4076
04:07:31,649 --> 04:07:32,530
I'm going to wait till they reload

4077
04:07:32,530 --> 04:07:33,489
and then I'm going to run.

4078
04:07:33,489 --> 04:07:35,889
Two, three, four, five, six.

4079
04:07:36,450 --> 04:07:36,690
Okay.

4080
04:07:36,690 --> 04:07:36,930
Ready?

4081
04:07:37,489 --> 04:07:38,209
Let's count.

4082
04:07:39,030 --> 04:07:41,350
Three, five, six.

4083
04:07:41,350 --> 04:07:47,969
Two, three, four.

4084
04:07:47,969 --> 04:07:49,649
One, two, three, four, five, six.

4085
04:07:49,649 --> 04:07:50,129
Five, six.

4086
04:07:52,920 --> 04:08:04,579
And one, two.

4087
04:08:04,579 --> 04:08:04,899
Come on.

4088
04:08:04,899 --> 04:08:06,639
I'm not going to fire.

4089
04:08:07,360 --> 04:08:23,440
Okay.

4090
04:08:23,440 --> 04:08:24,399
I'm all right.

4091
04:08:24,399 --> 04:08:25,959
Nobody right here.

4092
04:08:25,959 --> 04:08:26,600
I don't have a gun.

4093
04:08:34,770 --> 04:08:36,129
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

4094
04:08:36,129 --> 04:08:36,530
There's a guy.

4095
04:08:36,530 --> 04:08:37,170
There's a guy with a gun

4096
04:08:37,170 --> 04:08:38,690
but this is a health pack right here.

4097
04:08:38,690 --> 04:08:47,840
Move these boxes.

4098
04:08:47,840 --> 04:08:48,639
Get out of my way, please.

4099
04:08:49,200 --> 04:08:51,139
Can I zip line?

4100
04:08:51,139 --> 04:08:54,040
There's a dude right here with a gun.

4101
04:08:57,409 --> 04:08:57,809
I didn't.

4102
04:09:11,170 --> 04:09:11,889
Holy shit.

4103
04:09:11,889 --> 04:09:12,530
I'm okay.

4104
04:09:12,530 --> 04:09:23,000
I got one more bullet.

4105
04:09:23,000 --> 04:09:32,819
Which guns?

4106
04:09:33,379 --> 04:09:40,979
I need that gun.

4107
04:09:40,979 --> 04:09:41,379
Where is it?

4108
04:09:51,379 --> 04:10:00,420
All right.

4109
04:10:00,420 --> 04:10:01,620
Well, I'm headshotting his hand.

4110
04:10:14,690 --> 04:10:15,809
Headshotting the fence.

4111
04:10:17,510 --> 04:10:18,469
Kind of, but not really.

4112
04:10:29,120 --> 04:10:29,520
Don't do it.

4113
04:10:29,520 --> 04:10:30,079
It's not worth it.

4114
04:10:30,079 --> 04:10:30,559
It's not worth it.

4115
04:10:30,559 --> 04:10:30,959
It's not worth it.

4116
04:10:30,959 --> 04:10:31,440
It's not worth it.

4117
04:10:31,440 --> 04:10:32,159
Hide, hide, hide, hide.

4118
04:10:32,159 --> 04:10:32,559
It's not worth it.

4119
04:10:32,559 --> 04:10:33,840
Dude, what the fuck are you doing?

4120
04:10:33,840 --> 04:10:34,479
It's not worth it.

4121
04:10:34,479 --> 04:10:34,879
It's not worth it.

4122
04:10:34,879 --> 04:10:35,680
It's not worth it.

4123
04:10:35,680 --> 04:11:10,149
Give me your gun.

4124
04:11:10,149 --> 04:11:10,549
Give me your gun.

4125
04:11:10,549 --> 04:11:11,350
I want ammo.

4126
04:11:11,350 --> 04:11:23,510
Shit.

4127
04:11:23,510 --> 04:11:26,469
Guy right here.

4128
04:11:26,469 --> 04:11:27,030
Oh, okay.

4129
04:11:27,030 --> 04:11:27,750
We're safe.

4130
04:11:27,750 --> 04:11:33,809
Spike's on there.

4131
04:11:33,809 --> 04:11:34,770
I can't jump over that.

4132
04:11:34,770 --> 04:12:04,360
I thought it was a jump.

4133
04:12:04,360 --> 04:12:04,600
Cool.

4134
04:12:04,600 --> 04:12:04,840
All right.

4135
04:12:04,840 --> 04:12:14,739
So far so good.

4136
04:12:14,739 --> 04:12:15,379
All joke?

4137
04:12:15,379 --> 04:12:15,940
No.

4138
04:12:15,940 --> 04:12:18,920
I don't think you can fall off.

4139
04:12:18,920 --> 04:12:19,879
Even if you tried.

4140
04:12:19,879 --> 04:12:35,219
Try, try, try.

4141
04:12:35,219 --> 04:12:35,620
I can't.

4142
04:12:35,620 --> 04:12:36,579
I can't even fall down.

4143
04:12:36,579 --> 04:12:45,760
How far we've fallen.

4144
04:12:45,760 --> 04:12:48,239
We can find redemption in death.

4145
04:12:48,239 --> 04:12:49,200
This is just going on now.

4146
04:12:49,200 --> 04:12:49,600
Okay.

4147
04:12:49,600 --> 04:12:50,159
Now, William.

4148
04:12:51,120 --> 04:12:52,399
He was a sinner, yes.

4149
04:12:53,200 --> 04:12:55,989
But he was also a loving son.

4150
04:13:12,959 --> 04:13:14,389
Oilus from Mafia.

4151
04:13:15,110 --> 04:13:17,889
You're here right now.

4152
04:13:19,969 --> 04:13:20,610
In real time.

4153
04:13:20,610 --> 04:13:21,729
I just wanted to pay my respects.

4154
04:13:21,729 --> 04:13:22,209
Watching it.

4155
04:13:23,479 --> 04:13:24,200
Billy.

4156
04:13:24,200 --> 04:13:25,940
I never said this.

4157
04:13:25,940 --> 04:13:32,319
But I consider you my brother.

4158
04:13:32,319 --> 04:13:34,079
I can't even count all the times.

4159
04:13:34,079 --> 04:13:35,440
You saved my ass from a beating.

4160
04:13:37,200 --> 04:13:38,979
I don't know how I'm gonna-

4161
04:13:38,979 --> 04:13:39,479
Sweet.

4162
04:13:40,180 --> 04:13:40,680
Wait.

4163
04:13:41,219 --> 04:13:41,860
That's the guy.

4164
04:13:42,420 --> 04:13:44,020
That's the guy who killed Billy.

4165
04:13:44,020 --> 04:13:44,520
No.

4166
04:13:46,020 --> 04:13:46,739
Funeral?

4167
04:13:46,739 --> 04:13:47,379
Excuse me.

4168
04:13:48,659 --> 04:13:49,299
I'm telling you.

4169
04:13:49,299 --> 04:13:50,020
Everybody's a threat.

4170
04:13:50,020 --> 04:13:50,819
Everyone just has a gun.

4171
04:13:51,940 --> 04:13:53,319
This whole-

4172
04:13:53,319 --> 04:13:55,159
Everybody just stood up with machine guns and shit.

4173
04:13:56,040 --> 04:14:01,680
Kill Johnny.

4174
04:14:02,239 --> 04:14:08,180
Johnny?

4175
04:14:08,180 --> 04:14:08,979
That's Johnny over there.

4176
04:14:18,680 --> 04:14:19,000
All right.

4177
04:14:19,000 --> 04:14:19,959
Got him.

4178
04:14:19,959 --> 04:14:27,200
Give me that.

4179
04:14:27,200 --> 04:14:27,520
Wait.

4180
04:14:27,520 --> 04:14:28,399
Pocket revolver.

4181
04:14:28,399 --> 04:14:29,120
That sounds cool.

4182
04:14:30,020 --> 04:14:30,180
No.

4183
04:14:30,180 --> 04:14:30,899
That thing sucks.

4184
04:14:31,540 --> 04:14:36,399
The guy threw a molotov in a church.

4185
04:14:36,959 --> 04:14:37,280
Yeah.

4186
04:14:39,329 --> 04:14:39,969
Yeah, he did.

4187
04:14:40,610 --> 04:14:53,030
I'm sorry.

4188
04:14:53,670 --> 04:14:54,399
I'm sorry.

4189
04:14:54,399 --> 04:14:55,520
Everybody was doing it.

4190
04:14:55,520 --> 04:14:56,639
So I thought I would do it too.

4191
04:14:57,600 --> 04:14:58,559
Everyone was doing it.

4192
04:14:59,120 --> 04:15:04,500
I'm just such a creature of being able to be easily visually manipulated.

4193
04:15:16,290 --> 04:15:17,969
This is what was Billy involved in.

4194
04:15:17,969 --> 04:15:19,250
Get over here now.

4195
04:15:19,250 --> 04:15:28,899
Playing a game with a controller without any aim assist on.

4196
04:15:28,899 --> 04:15:29,860
That's another issue, I think.

4197
04:15:30,659 --> 04:15:33,700
Damn.

4198
04:15:33,700 --> 04:15:34,739
I'm just realizing that right now.

4199
04:15:35,299 --> 04:15:50,600
Take care of this guy, Fart.

4200
04:15:50,600 --> 04:15:53,110
That was sick.

4201
04:15:53,670 --> 04:15:55,440
Warming him up?

4202
04:15:55,440 --> 04:15:55,940
Who?

4203
04:16:01,600 --> 04:16:02,719
Oh, he's right there.

4204
04:16:02,719 --> 04:16:13,920
Why did the game just slow mo for that guy?

4205
04:16:13,920 --> 04:16:14,159
See?

4206
04:16:14,159 --> 04:16:15,200
I told you he's doing it.

4207
04:16:15,200 --> 04:16:16,000
Look it.

4208
04:16:16,000 --> 04:16:17,909
I have enough bullets.

4209
04:16:17,909 --> 04:16:20,739
What's going on?

4210
04:16:20,739 --> 04:16:24,389
Is my computer overheating?

4211
04:16:44,799 --> 04:16:49,110
Oh!

4212
04:16:49,110 --> 04:16:49,590
Fuck!

4213
04:16:49,590 --> 04:16:51,590
The shotgun was on the ground.

4214
04:17:01,479 --> 04:17:04,440
He punched me over the thing twice and I got stun locked.

4215
04:17:29,799 --> 04:17:45,540
Who's next?

4216
04:17:45,540 --> 04:17:45,940
Come on.

4217
04:17:47,360 --> 04:17:47,840
Yeah, cool.

4218
04:17:48,399 --> 04:17:57,829
Is that just Fortnite, that guy?

4219
04:17:57,829 --> 04:18:00,629
I think I got him.

4220
04:18:00,629 --> 04:18:01,110
Is that him?

4221
04:18:12,629 --> 04:18:13,510
What's with the gun, man?

4222
04:18:31,989 --> 04:18:32,950
Over here, right?

4223
04:18:32,950 --> 04:18:38,319
There he is.

4224
04:18:38,319 --> 04:18:38,559
Okay.

4225
04:18:38,559 --> 04:18:38,959
Let's go.

4226
04:18:39,520 --> 04:18:41,280
Leave vault on keyboard.

4227
04:18:41,920 --> 04:18:52,530
Hand grenade.

4228
04:18:52,530 --> 04:18:53,329
Holy hand grenade.

4229
04:18:53,329 --> 04:18:54,049
What?

4230
04:18:54,049 --> 04:18:58,500
Not yet, not yet, not yet.

4231
04:18:58,500 --> 04:18:58,899
Give me this.

4232
04:18:58,899 --> 04:19:00,500
This is the way this city works.

4233
04:19:00,500 --> 04:19:07,250
It's out of ammo?

4234
04:19:07,250 --> 04:19:14,790
I don't know how to punch.

4235
04:19:14,790 --> 04:19:15,350
I don't know how to punch.

4236
04:19:15,350 --> 04:19:15,829
How do you punch?

4237
04:19:17,190 --> 04:19:19,430
I don't know how to punch on the fucking keyboard.

4238
04:19:20,799 --> 04:19:22,239
I'm swapping between the two.

4239
04:19:22,959 --> 04:19:28,309
Is left alt?

4240
04:19:28,309 --> 04:19:36,680
Stop reloading.

4241
04:19:36,680 --> 04:19:37,799
You're wasting your ammo.

4242
04:20:12,000 --> 04:20:13,440
Oh my god.

4243
04:20:13,440 --> 04:20:16,719
That guy got shot like seven fucking times.

4244
04:20:16,719 --> 04:20:33,879
You did not get that off.

4245
04:20:33,879 --> 04:20:34,760
You motherfucker.

4246
04:20:34,760 --> 04:20:35,559
I can't believe you got it.

4247
04:20:47,700 --> 04:20:48,739
Stop fucking.

4248
04:20:48,739 --> 04:20:49,459
It's such a habit.

4249
04:20:49,459 --> 04:20:50,100
I'm sorry, it is.

4250
04:20:50,819 --> 04:21:08,469
This is the way this city works.

4251
04:21:18,399 --> 04:21:19,600
Oh, there's a machine gun right here.

4252
04:21:20,159 --> 04:21:20,979
Give me that thing.

4253
04:21:21,620 --> 04:21:29,459
Where is he?

4254
04:21:29,459 --> 04:21:35,750
That's it, right?

4255
04:21:35,750 --> 04:21:36,309
Okay, let's go.

4256
04:21:36,309 --> 04:21:51,540
Please, I'm enjoying this.

4257
04:21:51,540 --> 04:21:59,590
What have you done?

4258
04:22:00,879 --> 04:22:02,319
Murder in the house of God.

4259
04:22:03,200 --> 04:22:05,840
These men were criminals, father.

4260
04:22:07,729 --> 04:22:11,879
Thieves, rapists, killers.

4261
04:22:12,520 --> 04:22:16,280
And God would have embraced them if they'd asked for forgiveness.

4262
04:22:16,280 --> 04:22:17,079
That's hard.

4263
04:22:17,079 --> 04:22:20,680
Now, which one of these men might have sought redemption by working with the poor?

4264
04:22:21,750 --> 04:22:24,309
Which one might have saved just one life?

4265
04:22:24,309 --> 04:22:25,750
None of us, father.

4266
04:22:27,959 --> 04:22:29,239
You bastard.

4267
04:22:29,239 --> 04:22:29,719
Wait, didn't...

4268
04:22:30,520 --> 04:22:32,370
Do you have any confessions to make?

4269
04:22:32,370 --> 04:22:33,649
You better do it quick.

4270
04:22:33,649 --> 04:22:35,409
No more bloodshed, please.

4271
04:22:35,409 --> 04:22:38,049
I'm gonna just fill him with like eight rounds of...

4272
04:22:38,049 --> 04:22:39,250
I shot him with a machine gun, didn't I?

4273
04:22:39,809 --> 04:22:43,399
Consider this an act of divine retribution.

4274
04:22:51,719 --> 04:22:52,680
That make us even.

4275
04:22:54,920 --> 04:22:57,319
Sure. For now.

4276
04:23:00,639 --> 04:23:04,239
For your trouble, father.

4277
04:23:05,040 --> 04:23:05,840
Still alive.

4278
04:23:05,840 --> 04:23:07,200
I don't want your blood money.

4279
04:23:08,870 --> 04:23:09,750
You took theirs.

4280
04:23:11,860 --> 04:23:13,860
Not a lot of difference from where I'm standing.

4281
04:23:16,530 --> 04:23:19,010
There should be enough dough to patch up the bullet holes.

4282
04:23:19,969 --> 04:23:21,170
And keep you quiet.

4283
04:23:23,200 --> 04:23:30,770
When the cops come, you tell them the gunman who did this had East Coast accents.

4284
04:23:31,989 --> 04:23:33,590
We're really doing this to a priest?

4285
04:23:33,590 --> 04:23:36,790
I've been out of town, right?

4286
04:23:36,790 --> 04:23:42,360
I won't lie, but I won't say anything at all.

4287
04:23:42,360 --> 04:23:46,260
Good. Be ashamed if we had to come back here.

4288
04:23:47,299 --> 04:23:48,739
Am I gonna the priest?

4289
04:23:49,459 --> 04:23:50,680
Were you?

4290
04:23:50,680 --> 04:23:53,399
As soon as I walked in the church, the crew recognized me.

4291
04:23:53,959 --> 04:23:55,479
Followed me straight back out.

4292
04:23:55,479 --> 04:23:56,440
Holy shit, man.

4293
04:24:15,959 --> 04:24:16,440
My spot.

4294
04:24:26,629 --> 04:24:27,270
I'm not sure.

4295
04:24:27,270 --> 04:24:27,670
I'm just...

4296
04:24:36,719 --> 04:24:37,600
Where's the car?

4297
04:24:38,319 --> 04:24:39,040
Where's the car?

4298
04:24:39,760 --> 04:24:42,120
I gotta get in the car.

4299
04:24:42,120 --> 04:24:42,840
Oh, shit.

4300
04:24:42,840 --> 04:24:43,479
Okay, it's all right.

4301
04:24:44,040 --> 04:24:56,209
Stay here.

4302
04:24:56,209 --> 04:24:58,479
Get over here and don't move.

4303
04:25:26,049 --> 04:25:28,840
No, no, no, no, no, no, Polly.

4304
04:25:28,840 --> 04:25:29,559
What are you doing?

4305
04:25:29,559 --> 04:25:31,000
Stay back here, Polly.

4306
04:25:34,799 --> 04:25:46,280
We need a car.

4307
04:25:46,280 --> 04:25:50,450
Can you steal a car?

4308
04:25:51,090 --> 04:26:00,680
No, that's illegal.

4309
04:26:01,159 --> 04:26:08,819
How you doing?

4310
04:26:08,819 --> 04:26:10,260
All right, get out.

4311
04:26:10,260 --> 04:26:11,219
I'm getting...

4312
04:26:11,780 --> 04:26:14,950
Oh, there's a million police right there.

4313
04:26:14,950 --> 04:26:16,229
We did that real close.

4314
04:26:16,870 --> 04:26:25,059
Returning to the scene of the crime.

4315
04:26:30,180 --> 04:26:31,780
Yes, there was a stolen car.

4316
04:26:31,780 --> 04:26:32,260
You're right.

4317
04:26:32,260 --> 04:26:38,930
Well, today didn't turn out like I expected.

4318
04:26:38,930 --> 04:26:42,000
Oh, they know it's me?

4319
04:26:42,000 --> 04:26:42,879
I don't think they know it's me.

4320
04:26:43,520 --> 04:26:54,559
Whatever you did at the cat house got the cops plenty pissed.

4321
04:26:54,559 --> 04:26:57,360
Yeah, it was messy, but I got everything done.

4322
04:26:57,920 --> 04:26:58,959
Everything?

4323
04:26:58,959 --> 04:27:01,620
Yeah, everything.

4324
04:27:01,620 --> 04:27:05,969
Right into the car.

4325
04:27:05,969 --> 04:27:06,530
Right into the train.

4326
04:27:07,329 --> 04:27:11,430
Shit, I want a bike so bad.

4327
04:27:12,149 --> 04:27:13,510
We both ride the bike at the same time.

4328
04:27:16,389 --> 04:27:17,670
They giving up yet?

4329
04:27:17,670 --> 04:27:18,950
I don't think so.

4330
04:27:18,950 --> 04:27:20,950
They must have called out every cop in the city.

4331
04:27:22,790 --> 04:27:23,290
Move.

4332
04:27:36,600 --> 04:27:37,239
I'm doing it.

4333
04:27:37,959 --> 04:27:40,450
All right, get out of the car up here.

4334
04:27:40,450 --> 04:27:41,010
Into the park.

4335
04:27:41,649 --> 04:27:44,520
Get out, get out.

4336
04:27:44,520 --> 04:27:45,559
Run, run, quick, quick, quick, quick.

4337
04:27:45,559 --> 04:27:46,280
Get this way over here.

4338
04:28:11,319 --> 04:28:12,600
He's behind the newspaper.

4339
04:28:20,739 --> 04:28:21,299
No, I can't...

4340
04:28:22,420 --> 04:28:23,620
I can't just punch people.

4341
04:28:24,579 --> 04:28:30,100
I already punched my quota of ladies in the face today, okay?

4342
04:28:30,100 --> 04:28:31,299
I'm not adding to it.

4343
04:28:31,940 --> 04:28:32,979
I want a motorcycle though.

4344
04:28:33,540 --> 04:28:45,479
He has a quota.

4345
04:28:45,479 --> 04:28:46,200
No, I'm just saying...

4346
04:28:46,200 --> 04:28:47,879
I just want to go, all right, let's punch this person.

4347
04:28:47,879 --> 04:28:48,840
Let's punch this lady.

4348
04:28:48,840 --> 04:28:49,639
Let's punch this guy.

4349
04:28:50,280 --> 04:29:01,639
Is he a bike?

4350
04:29:02,280 --> 04:29:10,600
I've never seen anyone do the mission like this.

4351
04:29:10,600 --> 04:29:11,479
Did he shoot someone?

4352
04:29:12,120 --> 04:29:29,729
All right, come here.

4353
04:29:29,729 --> 04:29:32,450
It can't be reported stolen if nobody knows it was stolen.

4354
04:29:32,450 --> 04:29:44,629
All right, we're in the clear.

4355
04:29:55,430 --> 04:29:56,549
Bike, bike, bike.

4356
04:29:56,549 --> 04:29:57,430
It's all right, it's okay.

4357
04:29:57,989 --> 04:30:01,000
If you see another one, let me know though.

4358
04:30:01,319 --> 04:30:32,770
Can you get on?

4359
04:30:32,770 --> 04:30:37,510
Oh, he can't.

4360
04:30:37,510 --> 04:30:39,909
Oh my god, Sam, please hurry up.

4361
04:30:39,909 --> 04:30:42,840
That's annoying.

4362
04:30:42,840 --> 04:30:47,059
Really?

4363
04:30:47,059 --> 04:30:48,020
You can't get on the bike.

4364
04:30:50,469 --> 04:30:57,489
You think we're cute?

4365
04:30:59,010 --> 04:30:59,729
Yeah, sure.

4366
04:30:59,729 --> 04:31:18,120
All right, we got no police on us.

4367
04:31:18,120 --> 04:31:19,159
We're good to go.

4368
04:31:19,159 --> 04:31:21,239
Let's go straight on.

4369
04:31:21,239 --> 04:31:29,680
It's time for a pee break, by the way.

4370
04:31:29,680 --> 04:31:31,489
I'm gonna get some water too.

4371
04:31:31,489 --> 04:31:34,260
And think about all the crimes I've committed in this game.

4372
04:31:43,700 --> 04:31:44,340
Update the driver.

4373
04:31:44,340 --> 04:31:45,620
I don't think it's even necessary anymore.

4374
04:31:57,000 --> 04:31:59,319
Yeah, ever since I turned up the graphics, it's been fine.

4375
04:31:59,319 --> 04:32:02,610
All right, let me get some water.

4376
04:32:03,170 --> 04:32:04,149
I'll be back.

4377
04:32:08,280 --> 04:32:08,920
After this cutsie.

4378
04:32:08,920 --> 04:32:22,840
In a fit of paranoid rage, I thought this lady was gonna poison me.

4379
04:32:22,840 --> 04:32:25,719
She just wanted to show me where her friend Michelle was.

4380
04:32:25,719 --> 04:32:27,479
And I punched her in the face eight times.

4381
04:32:43,780 --> 04:32:45,510
It's a strange thing.

4382
04:32:45,510 --> 04:32:47,190
Nothing really came of it all.

4383
04:32:47,190 --> 04:32:49,670
I always figured Celia repaid off someone somewhere,

4384
04:32:49,670 --> 04:32:51,110
because it wasn't even in her papers.

4385
04:32:51,829 --> 04:32:56,520
Which store can you find this game?

4386
04:32:56,520 --> 04:32:57,020
Thanks.

4387
04:32:58,280 --> 04:32:59,079
Uh, Wal-Mart.

4388
04:33:00,440 --> 04:33:00,940
Target.

4389
04:33:02,120 --> 04:33:02,620
Amazon.

4390
04:33:04,119 --> 04:33:07,560
And Frank caught wind that Morello was helping Galati get re-elected,

4391
04:33:07,560 --> 04:33:09,319
hoping he'd go after the Don.

4392
04:33:09,319 --> 04:33:12,790
Well, I covered some account books for Morello's offices.

4393
04:33:12,790 --> 04:33:15,110
Sturdy Tree was a pretty good year for him.

4394
04:33:15,110 --> 04:33:17,029
Best didn't know we were bleeding out before we did.

4395
04:33:17,590 --> 04:33:21,509
While we were busy keeping our heads down, he started moving in on our rackets.

4396
04:33:21,509 --> 04:33:23,830
Quiet at first, a few trucks go missing.

4397
04:33:23,830 --> 04:33:26,310
Uh, Top Burner has one too many high balls, drives off-

4398
04:33:26,310 --> 04:33:27,830
Did anybody in the 30s eat food?

4399
04:33:29,990 --> 04:33:31,349
We haven't seen anybody eat any food.

4400
04:33:31,349 --> 04:33:34,549
We've seen them drink a shitload of coffee and cigarettes.

4401
04:33:34,549 --> 04:33:36,389
I think maybe Polly smelled something.

4402
04:33:36,389 --> 04:33:39,779
Oh, there's a Morello circling.

4403
04:33:39,779 --> 04:33:40,419
No one's eating.

4404
04:33:40,419 --> 04:33:41,939
Who was still making good money.

4405
04:33:41,939 --> 04:33:44,080
And with the Don worried about keeping the heat off,

4406
04:33:44,799 --> 04:33:45,840
we didn't have much to do.

4407
04:33:46,639 --> 04:33:48,479
Except drink, have a few laughs.

4408
04:33:49,439 --> 04:33:53,720
Every time I went into Salieri's, there was Sarah.

4409
04:33:55,680 --> 04:33:57,040
They literally just ordered their food.

4410
04:33:58,000 --> 04:33:59,439
They're not going to eat it on camera though.

4411
04:33:59,439 --> 04:34:03,080
Frank, Galati, the Don's consecutive.

4412
04:34:03,880 --> 04:34:04,599
Yeah, that's right.

4413
04:34:05,639 --> 04:34:06,520
He set me straight.

4414
04:34:08,549 --> 04:34:09,830
He set us all straight.

4415
04:34:11,939 --> 04:34:14,659
There's a lot of buzz around town about you guys.

4416
04:34:14,659 --> 04:34:16,500
Yeah, we got into a little scrap last night.

4417
04:34:16,500 --> 04:34:17,220
It's no big deal.

4418
04:34:18,099 --> 04:34:19,779
I don't care about the bar fight, Tom.

4419
04:34:20,659 --> 04:34:22,900
I care how it looks when you walk into a club

4420
04:34:22,900 --> 04:34:24,020
and buy everyone around.

4421
04:34:24,740 --> 04:34:26,020
We got to do something with our dough.

4422
04:34:26,900 --> 04:34:28,819
Then blow it at the track on Sunday.

4423
04:34:28,819 --> 04:34:30,099
All right, food recommendation time.

4424
04:34:33,459 --> 04:34:35,380
You want me to become one of those Wall Street boys?

4425
04:34:35,380 --> 04:34:36,659
Don't sass me, Tommy.

4426
04:34:37,990 --> 04:34:39,750
I'm trying to teach you the ropes

4427
04:34:39,750 --> 04:34:41,270
so you don't get strangled by them.

4428
04:34:43,639 --> 04:34:45,159
You ever have a dog, Tom?

4429
04:34:45,159 --> 04:34:45,880
Stonks?

4430
04:34:45,880 --> 04:34:46,380
Sure.

4431
04:34:47,159 --> 04:34:48,520
A little mud when I was a kid.

4432
04:34:48,520 --> 04:34:49,720
I don't think I can eat those.

4433
04:34:49,720 --> 04:34:52,759
When I was eight or nine, before I came over from the Ceasley,

4434
04:34:53,799 --> 04:34:56,360
I had this beautiful, skinny Cernico de Letna.

4435
04:34:57,159 --> 04:34:58,610
Like a little gray out.

4436
04:34:59,650 --> 04:35:01,409
Fastest dog you've ever seen.

4437
04:35:02,290 --> 04:35:03,650
That's how I met the Don.

4438
04:35:04,290 --> 04:35:06,290
We started setting up races together.

4439
04:35:07,090 --> 04:35:09,330
Pedding on her with coins and rifle shells.

4440
04:35:10,610 --> 04:35:12,849
There wasn't another dog that could catch her.

4441
04:35:13,799 --> 04:35:18,360
She never lost until the day she did.

4442
04:35:19,080 --> 04:35:22,549
We were only out of pocket knife, but

4443
04:35:23,509 --> 04:35:25,349
I never saw the Don so angry.

4444
04:35:26,389 --> 04:35:27,830
She got old on you?

4445
04:35:27,830 --> 04:35:28,330
No.

4446
04:35:29,110 --> 04:35:29,610
Pregnant.

4447
04:35:30,630 --> 04:35:32,790
She went into heat, got out of the yard,

4448
04:35:33,840 --> 04:35:36,400
and every dog in town had a turn.

4449
04:35:38,200 --> 04:35:39,639
You're like that dog, Tommy.

4450
04:35:41,169 --> 04:35:43,090
Every time you flash your money around,

4451
04:35:43,090 --> 04:35:44,369
you're a bitch in heat,

4452
04:35:44,369 --> 04:35:46,930
and everyone in that club is now looking to fuck you.

4453
04:35:48,049 --> 04:35:48,610
I think there's a

4454
04:35:49,250 --> 04:35:50,209
and once you get fucked

4455
04:35:50,209 --> 04:35:51,569
from where you could describe this to be.

4456
04:35:52,209 --> 04:35:53,409
You're no good to us.

4457
04:35:53,409 --> 04:35:54,849
What the hell are you doing?

4458
04:35:54,849 --> 04:35:58,119
You understand.

4459
04:36:00,580 --> 04:36:01,380
You made your point.

4460
04:36:02,340 --> 04:36:02,900
Good.

4461
04:36:02,900 --> 04:36:05,880
But you need to think about your career here.

4462
04:36:08,040 --> 04:36:10,130
Look, police at his ceiling.

4463
04:36:10,130 --> 04:36:11,729
It's a germatyr analogy.

4464
04:36:11,729 --> 04:36:13,250
He's not smart enough to run anything.

4465
04:36:14,130 --> 04:36:16,209
Sam is loyal, but he has no vision.

4466
04:36:17,090 --> 04:36:21,830
But you, Tommy, you could run this town someday.

4467
04:36:26,610 --> 04:36:28,930
I'm considerably more hateful than mine.

4468
04:36:29,569 --> 04:36:33,400
So what happened to the dog?

4469
04:36:33,400 --> 04:36:34,680
Don't tell me you're like Saturn.

4470
04:36:35,240 --> 04:36:36,119
Out in the atmosphere.

4471
04:36:36,680 --> 04:36:38,200
And me, I'm like Jupiter.

4472
04:36:38,200 --> 04:36:42,200
And the dawn, the dawn is like the galaxy.

4473
04:36:43,000 --> 04:36:43,799
You're not going to be careful.

4474
04:36:43,799 --> 04:36:45,959
You don't go too many revolutions around that sun.

4475
04:36:45,959 --> 04:36:47,080
You can let me off here.

4476
04:36:48,000 --> 04:36:48,560
That would be kind of...

4477
04:36:48,560 --> 04:36:49,279
Yeah, I could see that.

4478
04:36:49,279 --> 04:36:50,240
That's kind of what I would do.

4479
04:36:53,119 --> 04:36:55,040
Give Sarah my best, Tommy.

4480
04:36:55,040 --> 04:36:59,750
Jeremy, you just missed the moral of the whole story.

4481
04:37:04,439 --> 04:37:08,360
Don't show, don't flash around your money

4482
04:37:08,360 --> 04:37:09,799
and don't act like an asshole.

4483
04:37:09,799 --> 04:37:12,770
I think that's pretty much the whole story, right?

4484
04:37:13,779 --> 04:37:16,419
Back then, everything went through Frank.

4485
04:37:17,139 --> 04:37:20,020
The plans, the orders, the money.

4486
04:37:20,659 --> 04:37:23,619
You could get the call day or night.

4487
04:37:23,619 --> 04:37:30,770
Frank says to wait for him in the garage out in the back.

4488
04:37:32,040 --> 04:37:33,799
You got the job, I think.

4489
04:37:33,799 --> 04:37:34,520
Thanks, Luigi.

4490
04:37:35,810 --> 04:37:36,689
Sarah's cooking.

4491
04:37:36,689 --> 04:37:37,650
She's bringing something over.

4492
04:37:37,650 --> 04:37:39,009
Don't put the game on easy.

4493
04:37:39,970 --> 04:37:40,849
She's a good girl.

4494
04:37:40,849 --> 04:37:41,349
Right.

4495
04:37:41,889 --> 04:37:43,490
Pretty good moral of the story, I think.

4496
04:37:44,209 --> 04:37:46,099
All right, where's Frank?

4497
04:37:46,099 --> 04:38:03,880
In the day.

4498
04:38:03,880 --> 04:38:04,599
About to pee?

4499
04:38:04,599 --> 04:38:05,479
Oh, right, it's all right.

4500
04:38:06,200 --> 04:38:09,200
Oh, this has been kind of one big, long cutscene.

4501
04:38:15,360 --> 04:38:16,880
Thanks for waiting, Tom.

4502
04:38:16,880 --> 04:38:19,759
The Don and I had to go over last month's numbers again.

4503
04:38:19,759 --> 04:38:20,479
Sure.

4504
04:38:20,479 --> 04:38:21,200
So what's the job?

4505
04:38:21,840 --> 04:38:24,240
I want you to help Sam and Paulie with the shipment

4506
04:38:24,240 --> 04:38:25,840
we've got coming in tonight.

4507
04:38:25,840 --> 04:38:26,720
The good stuff?

4508
04:38:26,720 --> 04:38:27,680
Straight from Canada.

4509
04:38:28,799 --> 04:38:29,840
Where do you need me?

4510
04:38:29,840 --> 04:38:31,680
Sam's going to meet our friends from the north

4511
04:38:31,680 --> 04:38:32,959
at the farm outside of town.

4512
04:38:33,759 --> 04:38:35,040
Paulie will oversee the trucks

4513
04:38:35,040 --> 04:38:36,720
bringing the shipment into the city.

4514
04:38:36,720 --> 04:38:39,599
But I want you to go with him.

4515
04:38:39,599 --> 04:38:41,360
Oh, shit, this isn't an open world game.

4516
04:38:41,360 --> 04:38:43,360
Make sure it all goes smoothly.

4517
04:38:43,439 --> 04:38:43,939
Okay.

4518
04:38:44,560 --> 04:38:45,840
Get the car from Ralphie.

4519
04:38:45,840 --> 04:38:47,119
Meet Paulie at the warehouse.

4520
04:38:47,680 --> 04:38:48,639
What does it feel like it is?

4521
04:38:48,639 --> 04:38:49,840
In case you run into any trouble.

4522
04:38:50,400 --> 04:38:51,119
Sure, Frank.

4523
04:38:51,119 --> 04:38:52,000
No problem.

4524
04:38:52,000 --> 04:38:52,560
Good.

4525
04:38:52,560 --> 04:38:56,080
Now bring the Canadian home safe, Tommy.

4526
04:38:56,959 --> 04:38:59,439
There is already a case you're marked for the Don.

4527
04:39:00,319 --> 04:39:08,400
You can do free roaming?

4528
04:39:08,959 --> 04:39:10,919
All right, let's go.

4529
04:39:11,720 --> 04:39:13,080
All right, it's not let's pee.

4530
04:39:13,080 --> 04:39:14,040
We'll be back in like two minutes.

4531
04:39:14,599 --> 04:39:15,240
Beer B?

4532
04:39:15,240 --> 04:41:37,029
Okay, hello.

4533
04:41:37,029 --> 04:41:48,470
The order is yours if you want it, Tommy.

4534
04:41:48,470 --> 04:41:48,709
Thanks.

4535
04:41:48,709 --> 04:41:49,189
Going in.

4536
04:41:50,900 --> 04:41:51,540
Welcome back.

4537
04:41:52,500 --> 04:41:56,360
All right, I was looking at chat.

4538
04:42:12,259 --> 04:42:13,619
Drive to Sellier's warehouse.

4539
04:42:13,619 --> 04:42:14,819
All right, let's move on.

4540
04:42:16,150 --> 04:42:17,029
Drivers, I don't need them.

4541
04:42:17,029 --> 04:42:17,270
I'm good.

4542
04:42:18,150 --> 04:42:28,259
I need to make a turn here.

4543
04:42:31,319 --> 04:42:32,200
Holy shit.

4544
04:42:32,200 --> 04:42:33,240
I am intact.

4545
04:42:33,240 --> 04:42:33,740
Cool.

4546
04:42:34,200 --> 04:42:52,069
I'm not going to lead the cops to the job.

4547
04:42:52,709 --> 04:42:55,650
There's a guy on foot chasing me.

4548
04:42:55,650 --> 04:42:55,970
That's it.

4549
04:42:55,970 --> 04:42:56,450
I'm going to be fine.

4550
04:43:01,750 --> 04:43:02,229
Through here.

4551
04:43:04,610 --> 04:43:05,110
Mm-hmm.

4552
04:43:05,569 --> 04:43:08,099
Let's drive.

4553
04:43:08,099 --> 04:43:08,740
Yeah, I'm going.

4554
04:43:13,400 --> 04:43:14,520
Shit, that's a lot of noise.

4555
04:43:15,080 --> 04:43:25,380
Just hang out for a sec.

4556
04:43:27,349 --> 04:43:29,189
Drive slowly to the next checkpoint.

4557
04:43:29,189 --> 04:43:29,830
We're good to go.

4558
04:43:34,479 --> 04:43:35,680
Hop right in front of me.

4559
04:43:35,680 --> 04:43:43,720
All right, we're good.

4560
04:43:48,759 --> 04:43:50,279
I want to drive a motorcycle around.

4561
04:43:58,529 --> 04:43:59,729
Ask and you shall receive.

4562
04:44:09,490 --> 04:44:10,529
He hates the game.

4563
04:44:12,360 --> 04:44:13,479
We're getting that idea.

4564
04:44:19,400 --> 04:44:21,880
All right, now this is very slippery, but it's pretty cool.

4565
04:44:22,439 --> 04:44:23,159
I do wheelie.

4566
04:44:23,880 --> 04:44:27,029
I can ride like Batman.

4567
04:44:27,029 --> 04:44:27,430
That's cool.

4568
04:44:32,180 --> 04:44:35,159
And three, two, one.

4569
04:44:35,159 --> 04:44:36,680
Fly over the handlebars.

4570
04:44:36,680 --> 04:44:50,099
Oh no, it's the concussion sound again.

4571
04:44:57,029 --> 04:44:57,529
Fuck you.

4572
04:44:58,470 --> 04:45:10,979
Can't jump over that.

4573
04:45:10,979 --> 04:45:23,680
Can you see me?

4574
04:45:23,680 --> 04:45:33,220
Okay, now what?

4575
04:45:33,220 --> 04:45:36,360
Is he going to arrest me?

4576
04:45:36,360 --> 04:45:39,279
He's looking for me.

4577
04:45:39,279 --> 04:46:14,740
Wait, what was that sound?

4578
04:46:15,700 --> 04:46:18,740
I heard a vooga and then it exploded.

4579
04:46:19,540 --> 04:46:26,360
Okay, which way do I need to go?

4580
04:46:26,360 --> 04:46:27,159
Back to the bike.

4581
04:46:27,159 --> 04:46:28,520
The bike is right here.

4582
04:46:49,060 --> 04:46:51,279
How did I do that?

4583
04:46:51,279 --> 04:46:54,560
I don't because I was driving too fast with the motorcycle.

4584
04:46:54,560 --> 04:46:56,560
I crashed into somebody and then the guy chased me into the bush

4585
04:46:56,560 --> 04:46:58,159
and then I got shot by five cops.

4586
04:46:58,159 --> 04:47:11,159
Do I actually?

4587
04:47:11,159 --> 04:47:12,200
Okay, I'm not fucking around.

4588
04:47:13,700 --> 04:47:14,580
Get me the fuck out of this.

4589
04:47:15,299 --> 04:47:16,020
Who cares about the bike?

4590
04:47:16,020 --> 04:47:16,979
The bike is stupid.

4591
04:47:16,979 --> 04:47:18,099
You just crash and die.

4592
04:47:18,819 --> 04:47:26,360
The motorcycle doesn't go faster or anything.

4593
04:47:26,360 --> 04:47:28,819
It's just more vulnerable.

4594
04:47:41,349 --> 04:47:42,229
But it looks cool.

4595
04:47:42,229 --> 04:47:42,549
It does.

4596
04:47:42,549 --> 04:47:43,049
You're right.

4597
04:47:51,040 --> 04:47:52,720
Okay, and back to fast.

4598
04:47:53,439 --> 04:48:16,360
This guy's just in the way.

4599
04:48:17,080 --> 04:48:18,549
All right, no cops.

4600
04:48:19,110 --> 04:48:34,340
We're good.

4601
04:48:34,340 --> 04:48:47,200
Um, somebody said look at that link.

4602
04:48:47,200 --> 04:48:47,700
Hold on.

4603
04:48:52,610 --> 04:48:54,689
Is that the water doing that or is it me being an idiot?

4604
04:48:55,409 --> 04:48:58,840
Cops.

4605
04:49:03,270 --> 04:49:04,630
Why is everybody standing over here?

4606
04:49:11,380 --> 04:49:13,619
Because I looked back at the car accident?

4607
04:49:14,259 --> 04:49:14,759
What?

4608
04:49:21,970 --> 04:49:23,169
You nearly hit a guy.

4609
04:49:23,169 --> 04:49:23,810
I did not.

4610
04:49:24,529 --> 04:49:34,259
We're safe down here.

4611
04:49:34,259 --> 04:49:53,720
Okay, we're good.

4612
04:49:53,720 --> 04:49:55,959
Uh, he's coming back this way.

4613
04:49:56,599 --> 04:50:09,029
Oh shit, it's this dock.

4614
04:50:09,029 --> 04:50:10,069
I gotta go over the bridge.

4615
04:50:19,080 --> 04:50:21,720
No, did I just get the cops called on me again?

4616
04:50:33,000 --> 04:50:34,759
Because I fucking beeped at her.

4617
04:50:35,400 --> 04:50:41,330
Just take the ticket out.

4618
04:50:41,330 --> 04:50:44,290
No, but yeah, I mean there's no in-game currency.

4619
04:50:45,540 --> 04:50:46,659
That doesn't really do anything.

4620
04:50:46,659 --> 04:50:47,459
It's not a problem.

4621
04:50:48,180 --> 04:50:50,639
I don't think it takes money out of your account in the game.

4622
04:50:51,279 --> 04:50:53,279
All right, I'll just go turn myself in right here, right?

4623
04:50:54,080 --> 04:50:55,279
There's like three cops here.

4624
04:50:55,279 --> 04:50:56,400
Here, I will pay.

4625
04:50:58,200 --> 04:50:58,840
I will pay.

4626
04:50:59,720 --> 04:51:05,479
I will pay.

4627
04:51:09,080 --> 04:51:11,880
I'm paying my Skyrim debt.

4628
04:51:11,880 --> 04:51:17,700
What just happened?

4629
04:51:33,729 --> 04:51:35,569
Okay, we're good.

4630
04:51:36,209 --> 04:51:44,340
Don't tell me I could get you in trouble for that.

4631
04:51:44,979 --> 04:51:53,200
Oh, and uh, officers, excuse me.

4632
04:51:53,200 --> 04:51:56,639
Actually, were you just beeping at a pedestrian in the crosswalk?

4633
04:51:56,639 --> 04:51:58,479
I was crossing the road and you beeped at me.

4634
04:51:59,360 --> 04:52:02,259
I thought you both arrest yourselves.

4635
04:52:03,060 --> 04:52:10,400
Was I a pedestrian in the road and did you beep at me and scare me?

4636
04:52:11,119 --> 04:52:15,970
Why are they speed matching me?

4637
04:52:15,970 --> 04:52:16,529
I don't like this.

4638
04:52:56,419 --> 04:52:56,979
Seriously.

4639
04:52:57,619 --> 04:52:59,220
Oh, I can't play these games.

4640
04:52:59,220 --> 04:53:00,500
I like, I just can't.

4641
04:53:00,500 --> 04:53:02,419
My attention is so bad.

4642
04:53:02,419 --> 04:53:05,060
Like I look at chat and just read what you guys are saying.

4643
04:53:05,060 --> 04:53:06,470
I'm gonna straight away.

4644
04:53:06,470 --> 04:53:09,430
It's just like, I'm just, I'm looking over and just, oh, hey, hi guys.

4645
04:53:10,959 --> 04:53:12,400
Oh, fucking God.

4646
04:53:12,400 --> 04:53:13,840
Just get there for the love of God.

4647
04:53:14,479 --> 04:53:27,330
Holy shit, man.

4648
04:53:27,330 --> 04:53:27,729
Okay.

4649
04:53:29,330 --> 04:53:31,889
It's not Grand Theft Auto.

4650
04:53:31,889 --> 04:53:36,919
It's not GTA.

4651
04:53:36,919 --> 04:53:39,799
Stop playing the game like it's GTA.

4652
04:53:41,119 --> 04:53:45,520
You can't just like smash into stuff and just drive over people and drive into things.

4653
04:53:46,560 --> 04:53:47,279
There are rules.

4654
04:53:47,279 --> 04:53:48,479
There are laws in this game.

4655
04:54:02,130 --> 04:54:02,849
Lighting is pretty good.

4656
04:54:02,849 --> 04:54:03,330
Yeah, it is.

4657
04:54:03,330 --> 04:54:07,599
I mean, the game looks great.

4658
04:54:07,599 --> 04:54:09,040
It really does.

4659
04:54:20,389 --> 04:54:34,150
Ride the bank.

4660
04:54:36,849 --> 04:54:37,169
Okay.

4661
04:54:37,169 --> 04:54:38,130
Here we are.

4662
04:54:38,130 --> 04:54:39,250
Same exact spot.

4663
04:55:04,639 --> 04:55:06,159
Graphics are pretty good for the 1930s.

4664
04:55:06,159 --> 04:55:06,560
Yeah, they are.

4665
04:55:06,560 --> 04:55:18,689
This game is ridiculous.

4666
04:55:32,819 --> 04:55:33,860
Illegal speeder.

4667
04:55:43,240 --> 04:55:45,400
Sharing the road with this thing would be so hard.

4668
04:55:48,709 --> 04:55:50,709
I'm glad I don't live in a city that has one of those.

4669
04:55:50,709 --> 04:55:51,590
That would freak me out.

4670
04:56:03,279 --> 04:56:04,880
Normal driving RP or riot.

4671
04:56:04,880 --> 04:56:05,119
Fine.

4672
04:56:15,080 --> 04:56:15,880
Raining out today.

4673
04:56:22,689 --> 04:56:31,090
I thought I was going to break.

4674
04:56:35,029 --> 04:56:37,270
I thought I was going to crash through it.

4675
04:56:37,270 --> 04:56:38,229
Joke ruined.

4676
04:56:38,229 --> 04:56:38,630
Oh, well.

4677
04:56:39,430 --> 04:56:58,000
What is this place?

4678
04:56:58,000 --> 04:56:59,279
This place is across the whole game.

4679
04:56:59,919 --> 04:57:12,080
All right.

4680
04:57:12,080 --> 04:57:12,880
Take off the limiter.

4681
04:57:14,240 --> 04:57:15,840
Overclock the car, please.

4682
04:57:28,919 --> 04:57:29,159
All right.

4683
04:57:29,159 --> 04:57:30,279
Now it's back on.

4684
04:57:30,279 --> 04:57:36,419
When you get a straightaway like that, you got to go for it.

4685
04:57:36,419 --> 04:57:37,540
If there's no cops around, you're fine.

4686
04:57:38,180 --> 04:57:44,099
In front of that car, it looked like it was made of tin foil.

4687
04:57:55,830 --> 04:57:57,729
You know this place?

4688
04:57:57,729 --> 04:57:58,209
Oh, yeah.

4689
04:57:59,169 --> 04:58:01,090
We've done a few pickups at the farm before.

4690
04:58:01,810 --> 04:58:02,369
Don't worry.

4691
04:58:03,090 --> 04:58:05,970
There ain't nothing but cow shit and shine out here.

4692
04:58:06,930 --> 04:58:08,770
It's going to be an easy few clams.

4693
04:58:09,889 --> 04:58:13,330
We'll load up the trucks, we'll come straight back.

4694
04:58:13,330 --> 04:58:14,610
Yeah, let's make it quick.

4695
04:58:14,610 --> 04:58:15,650
I got someplace to be.

4696
04:58:16,450 --> 04:58:17,889
The skin is really good in this game.

4697
04:58:19,330 --> 04:58:22,369
You can see like all the random little splotchies.

4698
04:58:25,080 --> 04:58:26,040
How do you even do that?

4699
04:58:26,279 --> 04:58:29,479
Detecting the girl's virginity one day and taking it to the next.

4700
04:58:29,479 --> 04:58:31,799
How do you do next day after a shave looking?

4701
04:58:31,799 --> 04:58:32,279
Come on.

4702
04:58:32,279 --> 04:58:33,240
It's crazy.

4703
04:58:33,240 --> 04:58:34,119
I'm just kidding.

4704
04:58:35,080 --> 04:58:35,959
She's a good girl.

4705
04:58:37,090 --> 04:58:40,770
You settle down, she'll straighten you right out.

4706
04:58:40,770 --> 04:58:45,169
You're going home to a couch.

4707
04:58:45,729 --> 04:58:46,290
Yeah, the bumps.

4708
04:58:46,290 --> 04:58:47,250
The bumps look really good.

4709
04:58:48,209 --> 04:58:51,250
Now I wonder what kind of story she could tell about her old man though.

4710
04:58:51,970 --> 04:58:54,689
Cold killer back in the day.

4711
04:58:54,689 --> 04:58:55,889
Where are we driving?

4712
04:58:55,889 --> 04:58:58,049
Are we driving off the road?

4713
04:58:58,049 --> 04:58:58,610
Where are we?

4714
04:58:59,330 --> 04:59:01,939
You know, she's been helping out behind a bar

4715
04:59:01,939 --> 04:59:02,979
since she was a kid.

4716
04:59:02,979 --> 04:59:04,340
We're driving under water?

4717
04:59:05,060 --> 04:59:06,979
I bet she's seen and heard a few things.

4718
04:59:07,779 --> 04:59:10,549
Probably knows more about our business than we do.

4719
04:59:11,349 --> 04:59:12,229
She knows enough.

4720
04:59:12,229 --> 04:59:13,029
Where's this car?

4721
04:59:13,029 --> 04:59:14,310
How many questions?

4722
04:59:14,310 --> 04:59:16,560
That's good.

4723
04:59:16,560 --> 04:59:19,159
She won't ever make a liar out of you.

4724
04:59:19,159 --> 04:59:20,979
Christ.

4725
04:59:21,680 --> 04:59:23,990
Go to Mario just for that.

4726
04:59:27,430 --> 04:59:29,189
Watching a movie would be hell with you.

4727
04:59:29,189 --> 04:59:29,750
Damn it.

4728
04:59:29,750 --> 04:59:31,509
No, no, I put tape over my mouth.

4729
04:59:31,509 --> 04:59:33,509
Sam should be waiting here but I don't see him.

4730
04:59:34,930 --> 04:59:36,610
Something smells off.

4731
04:59:36,610 --> 04:59:38,959
Don't let your pecker get all shriveled up.

4732
04:59:39,599 --> 04:59:41,720
Probably just trying to get out of the rain.

4733
04:59:41,720 --> 04:59:42,520
The only thing you hear is

4734
04:59:50,080 --> 04:59:51,680
So if you turn the volume up loud enough

4735
04:59:51,680 --> 04:59:53,279
to like maybe seven or eight on your TV

4736
04:59:53,279 --> 04:59:54,000
you won't even hear that.

4737
04:59:56,819 --> 05:00:00,229
Okay, let's go find him.

4738
05:00:00,229 --> 05:00:04,810
Bastard.

4739
05:00:05,590 --> 05:00:07,430
It's just three sheets

4740
05:00:07,430 --> 05:00:09,270
and I'm wrecking a new suit for nothing.

4741
05:00:10,150 --> 05:00:11,430
I swear I'm gonna kill him.

4742
05:00:13,220 --> 05:00:13,720
Here.

4743
05:00:14,099 --> 05:00:16,290
Just in case Frank was right.

4744
05:00:17,090 --> 05:00:19,840
I'm gonna go grab them boys.

4745
05:00:19,840 --> 05:00:20,799
Get them sorted out.

4746
05:00:21,439 --> 05:00:23,279
You go ahead see what's what.

4747
05:00:23,360 --> 05:00:24,400
We'll catch up with you.

4748
05:00:24,400 --> 05:00:24,900
Jot gun.

4749
05:00:25,840 --> 05:00:34,130
Search for clues.

4750
05:00:39,509 --> 05:00:40,869
So the last mission was hit man.

4751
05:00:40,869 --> 05:00:42,229
Now this is like a detective game.

4752
05:00:42,790 --> 05:00:43,909
This game is everything, huh?

4753
05:00:46,240 --> 05:00:47,599
One quarter out of work.

4754
05:00:50,450 --> 05:00:51,569
Find Sam.

4755
05:00:51,569 --> 05:01:00,099
I'll be sneaking around.

4756
05:01:00,659 --> 05:01:09,669
Somebody here.

4757
05:01:09,669 --> 05:01:12,790
What is this?

4758
05:01:12,790 --> 05:01:15,200
A little target.

4759
05:01:15,200 --> 05:01:15,700
Oh.

4760
05:01:16,959 --> 05:01:18,080
Arlo Falcone.

4761
05:01:18,720 --> 05:01:20,630
Oh, it's a collectible card.

4762
05:01:20,630 --> 05:01:21,130
Okay, cool.

4763
05:01:26,529 --> 05:01:28,049
Investigate the truck.

4764
05:01:28,049 --> 05:01:33,889
Somebody in there.

4765
05:01:33,889 --> 05:01:34,529
Are they sleeping?

4766
05:01:42,869 --> 05:01:43,369
Hey buddy.

4767
05:01:45,029 --> 05:01:46,860
He's dead.

4768
05:01:48,959 --> 05:01:49,759
Jesus.

4769
05:01:49,759 --> 05:01:51,520
Drop your weapon.

4770
05:01:51,520 --> 05:01:52,159
You first.

4771
05:01:52,720 --> 05:01:54,080
We don't have time for this.

4772
05:01:54,080 --> 05:01:54,959
Sorry pal.

4773
05:01:54,959 --> 05:01:56,560
Guess we're doing this the hard way.

4774
05:01:57,759 --> 05:01:58,319
Okay then.

4775
05:01:59,680 --> 05:02:02,630
All right well he got one for me.

4776
05:02:02,630 --> 05:02:03,349
I didn't even have to aim.

4777
05:02:03,349 --> 05:02:03,849
I'm glad.

4778
05:02:04,630 --> 05:02:18,880
Into the house.

4779
05:02:18,880 --> 05:02:29,540
I shot the two glass bottles.

4780
05:02:29,540 --> 05:02:30,580
More than I could shoot the guy.

4781
05:02:31,220 --> 05:02:33,090
I'm getting collapsed on.

4782
05:02:33,090 --> 05:02:46,930
Oh come on.

4783
05:02:46,930 --> 05:02:48,209
I shot three times.

4784
05:02:48,209 --> 05:02:49,169
Right in the chest.

4785
05:02:49,169 --> 05:02:56,279
Put up the keyboard.

4786
05:02:56,279 --> 05:03:06,180
All right keyboard time.

4787
05:03:06,180 --> 05:03:22,470
Keyboard mode.

4788
05:03:22,470 --> 05:03:23,110
Yep.

4789
05:03:23,110 --> 05:03:25,409
Doesn't really help now does it?

4790
05:03:43,619 --> 05:03:44,119
Okay.

4791
05:03:44,200 --> 05:03:51,259
Is there ammo in here?

4792
05:03:51,259 --> 05:03:52,060
Yes there is.

4793
05:03:53,619 --> 05:03:54,659
Meet at the usual place.

4794
05:03:54,659 --> 05:03:55,380
Whatever that means.

4795
05:04:03,209 --> 05:04:04,650
It's a Wiimote?

4796
05:04:04,650 --> 05:04:05,930
Use a Wiimote.

4797
05:04:05,930 --> 05:04:07,610
You know I wish I could.

4798
05:04:07,610 --> 05:04:15,990
When I play games sometimes I go damn.

4799
05:04:15,990 --> 05:04:17,189
This would be so much better with a Wiimote.

4800
05:04:29,959 --> 05:04:30,919
Use a VR headset.

4801
05:04:30,919 --> 05:04:32,119
Hey glad you brought that up.

4802
05:04:32,840 --> 05:04:33,340
Tomorrow.

4803
05:04:34,740 --> 05:04:35,619
Going back to VR.

4804
05:04:36,180 --> 05:04:38,709
I'm gonna play multiplayer VR.

4805
05:04:39,930 --> 05:04:40,490
With some friends.

4806
05:04:51,159 --> 05:04:53,639
I leaked it already but I'm not gonna leak it anymore.

4807
05:04:58,860 --> 05:05:00,700
That's not gonna happen till late tomorrow night.

4808
05:05:01,259 --> 05:05:01,819
Very late.

4809
05:05:03,990 --> 05:05:07,830
8 am pacific is when that stream is gonna be a late one tomorrow.

4810
05:05:32,919 --> 05:05:34,040
All right let's go find Sam.

4811
05:05:39,080 --> 05:05:42,389
How much ammo?

4812
05:05:42,389 --> 05:05:43,349
Nah I'll keep the shotgun.

4813
05:05:44,150 --> 05:05:46,869
Any more ammo though?

4814
05:05:46,869 --> 05:05:48,229
I want a bunch of ammo for the shotgun.

4815
05:05:48,869 --> 05:05:53,240
Here we go.

4816
05:05:54,740 --> 05:05:56,020
Okay now I feel confident.

4817
05:05:56,580 --> 05:06:02,869
East coast?

4818
05:06:02,869 --> 05:06:04,950
Yeah that's gonna be 11 pm start east coast.

4819
05:06:04,950 --> 05:06:05,430
It's late.

4820
05:06:06,150 --> 05:06:09,669
The latest stream I've done in probably a year or two.

4821
05:06:10,310 --> 05:06:16,330
Should be a lot of fun though.

4822
05:06:16,330 --> 05:06:20,169
And that starts the beginning of a lot of VR.

4823
05:06:21,400 --> 05:06:23,080
FTK obviously is gonna be this weekend.

4824
05:06:24,099 --> 05:06:26,979
And tomorrow I'm gonna start the stream a little early tomorrow.

4825
05:06:28,919 --> 05:06:32,279
Yes so I can get VR set up and we're gonna talk about FTK.

4826
05:06:33,080 --> 05:06:37,939
Yes a little bit maybe like before maybe 20 minutes before everyone kind of shows up.

4827
05:06:39,220 --> 05:06:44,310
Because that's happening this weekend.

4828
05:06:44,310 --> 05:06:49,860
So holotov's over here for what?

4829
05:06:53,959 --> 05:06:56,099
Oh shit what the hell is this?

4830
05:07:05,459 --> 05:07:06,659
End of the stream voice?

4831
05:07:06,659 --> 05:07:07,380
Yeah probably.

4832
05:07:11,349 --> 05:07:12,470
Yeah probably.

4833
05:07:12,470 --> 05:07:13,430
It's getting to be that point.

4834
05:07:13,990 --> 05:07:18,790
I'll be back tomorrow though.

4835
05:07:18,790 --> 05:07:21,380
Tomorrow's gonna be high energy.

4836
05:07:21,380 --> 05:07:22,340
It's gonna be in VR.

4837
05:07:23,060 --> 05:07:24,869
Is that a bad guy?

4838
05:07:24,869 --> 05:07:25,270
Oh no.

4839
05:07:29,500 --> 05:07:30,939
Today was pretty high energy too.

4840
05:07:30,939 --> 05:07:32,619
The last few streams have been pretty high energy.

4841
05:07:33,740 --> 05:07:34,459
High energy?

4842
05:07:34,459 --> 05:07:35,580
Why can I not say that together?

4843
05:07:36,139 --> 05:07:43,500
Pretty much always high energy.

4844
05:07:44,060 --> 05:07:46,279
The only time I'm not high energy.

4845
05:07:47,479 --> 05:07:50,520
I think we found him.

4846
05:07:51,939 --> 05:07:53,459
All right we got him.

4847
05:07:53,459 --> 05:07:55,060
We found the bad guys.

4848
05:08:00,759 --> 05:08:02,040
Throw Molotov in here?

4849
05:08:02,599 --> 05:08:03,959
All right I'm gonna throw Molotov in there.

4850
05:08:07,860 --> 05:08:08,580
Nobody in here.

4851
05:08:15,799 --> 05:08:16,520
All right I got the back.

4852
05:08:20,599 --> 05:08:28,919
He's never gonna finish this game?

4853
05:08:28,919 --> 05:08:31,479
Um I don't know.

4854
05:08:31,479 --> 05:08:31,959
I might.

4855
05:08:33,049 --> 05:08:36,330
Once VR is set up it's not being teared down for a while.

4856
05:08:36,330 --> 05:08:39,049
I've got like a dozen VR games I have to play while that's set up.

4857
05:08:48,599 --> 05:08:48,919
He won't.

4858
05:08:48,919 --> 05:08:49,319
He won't.

4859
05:08:49,319 --> 05:08:49,799
He won't.

4860
05:08:49,799 --> 05:08:52,360
Yeah I you know let's just say I won't.

4861
05:08:52,360 --> 05:08:53,000
What?

4862
05:08:53,000 --> 05:08:54,659
That doesn't mean I'm not having fun.

4863
05:08:55,299 --> 05:09:00,869
Is that?

4864
05:09:01,590 --> 05:09:04,470
Oh shit that was I think that was one of our friends.

4865
05:09:05,189 --> 05:09:22,540
Well there he is.

4866
05:09:22,540 --> 05:09:24,599
Is he dead?

4867
05:09:25,159 --> 05:09:33,540
Gamer mode come on.

4868
05:09:33,540 --> 05:09:48,380
That guy's still on fire.

4869
05:09:48,380 --> 05:09:53,159
That's not a red barrel.

4870
05:10:11,900 --> 05:10:13,020
You guys can you just shoot him?

4871
05:10:16,180 --> 05:10:32,659
Get it off!

4872
05:10:32,659 --> 05:10:34,580
That lightning just distracted me.

4873
05:10:39,959 --> 05:10:43,080
Shoot him shoot him shoot him shoot him shoot him shoot him shoot him shoot him shoot this guy.

4874
05:10:43,880 --> 05:10:52,060
I'm fine.

4875
05:10:52,060 --> 05:10:58,900
What a grenade grenade grenade grenade grenade grenade grenade grenade.

4876
05:11:06,250 --> 05:11:07,130
I need another gun.

4877
05:11:08,700 --> 05:11:09,580
Did I pick up grenades?

4878
05:11:10,889 --> 05:11:13,639
No I didn't.

4879
05:11:13,639 --> 05:11:19,750
Shit okay I'm gonna go for it in one two press the wrong button.

4880

4883
05:11:37,459 --> 05:11:38,180
Let's go.

4884
05:11:38,180 --> 05:11:46,439
Are you gonna call me a dead prick?

4885
05:12:17,830 --> 05:12:19,029
What aim?

4886
05:12:19,029 --> 05:12:21,110
The aim is unbelievable.

4887
05:12:22,069 --> 05:12:31,450
That landed right at my feet.

4888
05:12:31,450 --> 05:12:36,040
This is on easy?

4889
05:12:36,040 --> 05:12:38,919
No this is on like the realism game mode for some reason.

4890
05:12:39,479 --> 05:13:00,540
It's only easy when I want it to be.

4891
05:13:00,540 --> 05:13:01,099
Yeah that's right.

4892
05:13:01,659 --> 05:13:21,979

Oh my god he's made it out of metal.

4895
05:14:02,439 --> 05:14:03,240
Chubby bunny.

4896
05:14:13,419 --> 05:14:15,900
I'm just gonna look like I had wisdom teeth surgery.

4897
05:14:16,700 --> 05:14:29,770
I should put him in.

4898
05:14:30,409 --> 05:14:31,450
Put a bunch of gauze.

4899
05:14:33,419 --> 05:14:34,220
Around my mouth.

4900
05:14:38,580 --> 05:14:41,779

Wait were those two named characters or was those two just friends?

4905
05:15:34,540 --> 05:15:35,500
In quotes.

4906
05:15:35,500 --> 05:15:39,799
I don't have any ammo.

4907
05:15:44,759 --> 05:15:45,689

Can you move over the other way man?

4913
05:16:40,220 --> 05:16:53,290
Like can you just throw a molotov on keyboard?

4914
05:16:54,700 --> 05:17:01,270
T-R-Y-A-X-G?

4915
05:17:01,830 --> 05:17:09,900
I feel like I'm just playing Left 4 Dead.

4916
05:17:11,990 --> 05:17:24,580
Another game this game is.

4917
05:17:24,580 --> 05:17:25,540

4918
05:17:25,619 --> 05:17:27,479
Up the stairs.

4919
05:17:34,700 --> 05:17:37,099
Uh all right Daenerys Targaryen.

Oh come on really man?

4926
05:18:11,560 --> 05:18:16,919
That was just somebody went into gmod and moved that face around.

4927
05:18:16,919 --> 05:18:18,119
That wasn't even me doing that.

4928

05:20:59,080 --> 05:21:00,279

Silent gamer mode.

4963
05:21:56,099 --> 05:21:57,939
What is happening with my gun?

4964
05:22:22,279 --> 05:22:24,840
Nobody cares about style points right now.

4965
05:22:24,840 --> 05:22:36,380

Absolute full blown gamer mode coming up.

4975
05:23:15,340 --> 05:23:39,779
I can't believe Jax ignored my gifted sub.

4976
05:23:39,779 --> 05:23:51,349

4982
05:24:06,310 --> 05:24:07,849
You guys just shower me with money.

4983
05:24:07,849 --> 05:24:09,369
Hopefully you think it's worth it.

4984
05:24:12,169 --> 05:24:13,450
Thanks guys seriously that's a lot of money.

4985
05:24:13,450 --> 05:24:14,490

05:24:14,490 --> 05:24:14,810
Thank you.

4987
05:24:16,259 --> 05:24:17,299
Sing the song.

Well he ain't any worse.

4989
05:24:19,060 --> 05:24:19,860
No.

4990
05:24:19,860 --> 05:24:20,979
I'll go get him.

4991
05:24:20,979 --> 05:24:21,939
Keep an eye out.

4992
05:24:21,939 --> 05:24:23,459
Mitchell thanks for the five subs Mitchell.

4993
05:24:25,979 --> 05:24:26,939
Thanks a lot.

4994
05:24:26,939 --> 05:24:31,909
We all know that German needs a shower right now.

4995
05:24:31,909 --> 05:24:33,270
I'm fairly clean right now.

4996
05:24:40,819 --> 05:24:42,659
I took a shower like six hours ago.

4997
05:24:42,659 --> 05:24:43,220
Seven hours ago.

4998
05:24:43,220 --> 05:24:43,720
I'm fine.

4999
05:24:53,909 --> 05:25:03,849
Okay we got more company.

5000
05:25:03,849 --> 05:25:04,490
Of course we do.

5001
05:25:15,180 --> 05:25:16,619
Jax mode three all right.

5002
05:25:17,419 --> 05:25:30,180
You wash behind your ears.

5003
05:25:30,900 --> 05:25:31,540
Yes.

5004
05:25:31,540 --> 05:25:37,459
When I shampoo I go behind both ears.

5005
05:25:42,310 --> 05:25:50,810
Like I did?

5006
05:25:50,810 --> 05:25:54,520
Is this car driving itself?

5007
05:26:04,630 --> 05:26:05,590
Here comes the armored truck.

5008
05:26:06,310 --> 05:26:10,840
I think that was just a guy on a motorcycle.

5009
05:26:10,840 --> 05:26:11,720
I don't think that was even a cop.

5010
05:26:12,360 --> 05:26:19,560
Tesla?

5011
05:26:20,200 --> 05:26:21,000
Tesla car?

5012
05:26:28,389 --> 05:26:29,990
You clean your...

5013
05:26:29,990 --> 05:26:31,189
Yes I do.

5014
05:26:31,189 --> 05:26:32,069
I clean my clothes.

5015
05:26:32,950 --> 05:26:36,869
I got him.

5016
05:26:48,580 --> 05:26:50,099
I don't know why I just read this.

5017
05:26:50,099 --> 05:26:52,500
I think I thought somebody just said centrist truck.

5018
05:26:53,659 --> 05:26:55,740
Like how what does it even mean?

5019
05:26:56,700 --> 05:27:11,500
Come on get the driver.

5020
05:27:19,930 --> 05:27:20,970
Driver driver get the driver.

5021
05:27:23,639 --> 05:27:24,139
What?

5022
05:27:45,450 --> 05:27:53,529
Okay it's all my the truck's already dead.

5023
05:28:04,180 --> 05:28:05,860
You died to centrist wheel.

5024
05:28:15,619 --> 05:28:16,659
Um where are they?

5025
05:28:25,479 --> 05:28:27,479
One down and there's one down.

5026
05:28:28,040 --> 05:28:29,319
The truck is about to explode.

5027
05:28:31,479 --> 05:28:32,599
Oh we're good.

5028
05:28:32,599 --> 05:28:45,400
Going to clear?

5029
05:28:55,639 --> 05:28:56,439
More.

5030
05:28:56,439 --> 05:29:10,950
That guy thinks he's he-man right now.

5031
05:29:10,950 --> 05:29:13,110
That cop couldn't even believe it himself.

5032
05:29:13,110 --> 05:29:20,810
Am I soft-locked?

5033
05:29:35,159 --> 05:29:40,540
Come on.

5034
05:29:40,540 --> 05:29:45,580
Did I not kill the guy behind there?

5035
05:29:50,310 --> 05:29:50,869
He's still there.

5036
05:29:51,590 --> 05:30:11,669
I think we're good.

5037
05:30:15,220 --> 05:30:18,740
No apparently not.

5038
05:30:18,740 --> 05:30:19,540
There's another one.

5039
05:30:20,259 --> 05:30:27,259
Okay armored truck versus bread van.

5040
05:30:32,659 --> 05:30:33,939
I wonder which one's gonna win.

5041
05:30:34,419 --> 05:30:45,990
Dude it's tires.

5042
05:30:45,990 --> 05:30:54,549
Shoot the gun.

5043
05:30:58,139 --> 05:30:59,020
It wants me to shoot the gun.

5044
05:30:59,020 --> 05:31:10,069
It kind of sounds like Barry from American Dad.

5045
05:31:10,069 --> 05:31:25,180
Steve's friend.

5046
05:31:25,180 --> 05:31:26,060
Holy shit.

5047
05:31:31,610 --> 05:31:34,779
Okay shoot just duck.

5048
05:31:34,779 --> 05:31:36,060
When they reload shoot it a little bit.

5049
05:31:36,060 --> 05:31:37,340
Duck shoot a little bit.

5050
05:31:37,340 --> 05:31:38,939
Duck shoot a little bit in the gun.

5051
05:31:38,939 --> 05:31:39,659
I know I know.

5052
05:31:39,659 --> 05:31:59,900
That's what I'm gonna get it.

5053
05:31:59,900 --> 05:32:22,840
Shoot the gun.

5054
05:32:22,840 --> 05:32:23,400
I know.

5055
05:32:31,450 --> 05:32:33,610
God take out the what?

5056
05:32:33,610 --> 05:32:34,569
The windshield?

5057
05:32:42,220 --> 05:32:44,619
Oh my god this is gonna be so hard to shoot the lights out.

5058
05:32:45,340 --> 05:32:51,610
Did I get it?

5059
05:32:51,610 --> 05:32:52,330
Yes.

5060
05:32:52,330 --> 05:32:58,299
Tommy take out the trash.

5061
05:32:58,299 --> 05:32:59,580
The trash?

5062
05:32:59,580 --> 05:33:00,540
Why are you saying it like that?

5063
05:33:01,259 --> 05:33:11,340
I just dropped him.

5064
05:33:11,340 --> 05:33:14,220
I'm playing like Blinko on the Price is Right.

5065
05:33:14,220 --> 05:33:15,020
I'm not even aiming.

5066
05:33:21,450 --> 05:33:30,060
This mission is really long.

5067
05:33:30,060 --> 05:33:30,779
Holy shit.

5068
05:33:43,860 --> 05:33:45,220
I feel like this guy would be dead by now.

5069
05:34:15,060 --> 05:34:16,740
Toilet bowl gaming five community subs.

5070
05:34:16,740 --> 05:34:17,380
Thanks a lot dude.

5071
05:34:24,009 --> 05:34:24,889
That's a pretty cool name.

5072
05:34:29,080 --> 05:34:35,909
I like that name.

5073
05:34:35,909 --> 05:34:36,310
I really do.

5074
05:34:54,759 --> 05:34:55,240
You didn't?

5075
05:34:56,279 --> 05:34:58,759
I did everything.

5076
05:34:59,400 --> 05:35:14,279
I want like five grand or I'm walking.

5077
05:35:14,919 --> 05:35:18,220
That was a five grand kind of play there.

5078
05:35:22,380 --> 05:35:22,779
All right.

5079
05:35:23,580 --> 05:35:27,540
That is where I'm going to end the stream tonight.

5080
05:35:27,540 --> 05:35:28,580
Thanks for watching everybody.

5081
05:35:29,220 --> 05:35:32,020
I will see you tomorrow for VR.

5082
05:35:32,580 --> 05:35:34,599
I think that's a good stopping point.

5083
05:35:38,180 --> 05:35:38,979
Sorry I put it on easy.

5084
05:35:38,979 --> 05:35:39,939
Sorry I punched that lady.

5085
05:35:39,939 --> 05:35:41,139
Sorry I shot that guy.

5086
05:35:41,139 --> 05:35:42,259
Sorry I strangled that guy.

5087
05:35:42,259 --> 05:35:43,220
Sorry I strangled the other guy.

5088
05:35:43,220 --> 05:35:44,180
Sorry I shot that other guy.

5089
05:35:44,180 --> 05:35:46,419
Sorry I ran that whole bunch of people over.

5090
05:35:46,419 --> 05:35:47,939
Please forgive me.

5091
05:35:48,500 --> 05:35:55,639
Actually kind of a big map.

5092
05:35:55,639 --> 05:35:56,680
No not forgiven.

5093
05:35:58,250 --> 05:35:59,770
I also blew up the clown too.

5094
05:35:59,770 --> 05:36:01,130
Oh well I didn't actually do that.

5095
05:36:01,689 --> 05:36:02,569
I think he was still alive.

5096
05:36:06,630 --> 05:36:07,590
Thank you everybody.

5097
05:36:07,590 --> 05:36:08,310
We'll see you soon.

5098
05:36:09,029 --> 05:36:12,119
Tomorrow at 8 p.m. Pacific.

5099
05:36:12,119 --> 05:36:13,849
I'm going to be playing VR.

5100
05:36:14,409 --> 05:36:16,860
I'm going to be setting it up and doing that all over again.

5101
05:36:17,580 --> 05:36:20,009
Half-Life Alex will be shortly after that.

5102
05:36:20,569 --> 05:36:21,529
Probably next week.

5103
05:36:22,090 --> 05:36:34,419
And after that maybe I will come back.

5104
05:36:34,419 --> 05:36:36,580
At this point probably like another six to seven hours left in the game.

5105
05:36:37,220 --> 05:36:39,060
Maybe one more full stream of this game.

5106
05:36:39,060 --> 05:36:40,419
Maybe.

5107
05:36:40,419 --> 05:36:41,459
It depends.

5108
05:36:41,459 --> 05:36:45,340
I'm looking forward to Half-Life Alex.

5109
05:36:45,900 --> 05:36:48,139
It'll be a lot of fun.

5110
05:36:48,139 --> 05:36:48,860
But thank you everybody.

5111
05:36:48,860 --> 05:36:49,419
Thanks all the subs.

5112
05:36:49,419 --> 05:36:51,340
There was a lot of gifted subs today.

5113
05:36:51,340 --> 05:36:56,060
A couple of huge raids too.

5114
05:36:56,060 --> 05:36:58,619
Kind of one hour or two hours apart from each other.

5115
05:36:58,619 --> 05:36:59,659
So thank you Kitboga.

5116
05:36:59,659 --> 05:37:00,860
Thank you Nyaners.

5117
05:37:00,860 --> 05:37:04,540
Still going to be looking forward to that Mr. Slime avatar stream.

5118
05:37:06,259 --> 05:37:07,939
You know it's coming.

5119
05:37:07,939 --> 05:37:11,529
Thank you though.

5120
05:37:11,529 --> 05:37:14,680
So I...

5121
05:37:14,680 --> 05:37:16,200
Where am I going to put you guys today?

5122
05:37:16,200 --> 05:37:16,840
Let's see.

5123
05:37:16,840 --> 05:37:18,200
Let me see who's live.

5124
05:37:18,200 --> 05:37:21,529
Let me see.

5125
05:37:21,529 --> 05:37:22,810
Who do I want to raid today?

5126
05:37:26,090 --> 05:37:27,450
Raid Mr. Slime.

5127
05:37:36,250 --> 05:37:37,369
Raid the debate.

5128
05:37:37,369 --> 05:37:38,970
No I'm not doing that.

5129
05:37:38,970 --> 05:37:43,290
Critical is critical.

5130
05:37:43,290 --> 05:37:44,569
Yeah critical is online right?

5131
05:37:44,569 --> 05:37:46,220
What's critical doing?

5132
05:37:46,220 --> 05:37:57,270
Raid the debate.

5133
05:37:57,270 --> 05:37:58,709
I'm not going to raid the debate.

5134
05:37:58,709 --> 05:38:00,709
That's a mistake.

5135
05:38:01,430 --> 05:38:07,930
What's critical doing right now?

5136
05:38:10,520 --> 05:38:11,159
Oh shit.

5137
05:38:11,159 --> 05:38:12,040
Hey this game...

5138
05:38:13,340 --> 05:38:13,900
This game...

5139
05:38:15,020 --> 05:38:18,060
Maybe you might see it real soon in virtual reality.

5140
05:38:25,000 --> 05:38:26,680
He's playing Phasmophobia.

5141
05:38:27,319 --> 05:38:30,439
Which is exactly what we're going to play tomorrow.

5142
05:38:30,439 --> 05:38:37,669
And when I say we I mean some mystery streamers.

5143
05:38:37,669 --> 05:38:39,189
Go tell Critical hello.

5144
05:38:39,189 --> 05:38:41,380
I'll see you guys soon.

5145
05:38:41,380 --> 05:38:42,419
Enjoy the rest of your day.

5146
05:38:42,419 --> 05:38:43,380
See you tomorrow night.

5147
05:38:43,380 --> 05:38:52,069
The mystery yeah.

5148
05:38:52,630 --> 05:38:55,610
Good night guys.

5149
05:38:55,610 --> 05:38:56,330
I'll see you tomorrow.

5150
05:38:57,139 --> 05:38:58,419
Thank you again for watching.

5151
05:39:00,060 --> 05:39:01,900
Well that was just me linking his channel.

5152
05:39:01,900 --> 05:39:03,419
Let's actually raid his channel.

5153
05:39:03,979 --> 05:39:40,490
See you later.
