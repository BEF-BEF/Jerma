1
00:00:01,139 --> 00:00:07,009
I still have the Didalus encounter discs scattered around my desk.

2
00:00:07,009 --> 00:00:08,609
Is this a rare game? Are these worth anything?

3
00:00:08,609 --> 00:00:16,690
Is the Didalus encounter worth any money if it's in the disc with the original packaging or anything?

4
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:23,420
I mean, it might be. It's a 3DO game with all these raids.

5
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:26,989
Yeah, all right. It's all right.

6
00:00:26,989 --> 00:00:33,789
Am I crazy to say that, like, you should have to do two-factor authentication with your phone if you're gonna do a one viewer, one person raid?

7
00:00:33,789 --> 00:00:36,539
I mean, come on, Quinn.

8
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:52,990
Like, I'm looking at my timeline of stream lab stuff, and this just, like, you guys are just breaking the system here.

9
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:59,799
It's just a bunch of these one, one, well, this was two viewers. Wait a minute.

10
00:01:00,299 --> 00:01:07,659
You guys are just raiding me from your personal Twitch channels. You're already here. Why are you doing that?

11
00:01:08,219 --> 00:01:17,469
What, how does it, wait, hold on a minute. I have a question. If you,

12
00:01:18,469 --> 00:01:25,140
If you raid me from your account, and you're here, are you fucking up my view count?

13
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:34,959
Yeah? Well, cut it out.

14
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,209
Inflated viewers.

15
00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:49,769
No, like, look, and people wonder, oh, I can't believe you missed that raid today. Wow, there was a raid that came in.

16
00:01:49,769 --> 00:01:53,810
Yeah, it's in the middle of, like, it's like in the middle of 300 one viewer raids.

17
00:01:54,409 --> 00:01:59,269
Imagine if I had a notification that played, like,

18
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:06,510
Would have raids came in, that's why I don't have sounds to play anymore. He's, what an entitled streamer.

19
00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:15,409
No, okay, if you, look, if you, like, raid this channel, I really appreciate it.

20
00:02:15,409 --> 00:02:21,449
But if you're in pre-stream chat, raiding the channel to just, just get on my stream labs feed,

21
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:30,800
that's a different story.

22
00:02:31,159 --> 00:02:33,159
Ungrateful, ungrateful.

23
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:37,300
He hates us.

24
00:02:37,419 --> 00:02:40,020
Can you stop screaming? I have homework to do.

25
00:02:41,969 --> 00:02:43,969
But just lower your volume.

26
00:02:43,969 --> 00:02:54,900
Today, we're gonna play Bugsnax again. We're gonna, might even get to the end of this game, I assume, if we don't, and we don't.

27
00:02:55,460 --> 00:03:03,560
But I'm playing it again. I think it's fun. I think it's cool. I think it's just, it's worth just chilling out and playing.

28
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:10,360
I like it. I have, oh, I adjusted my seat today to make sure

29
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:18,270
that I could, I'm, I'm sitting back in my chair right now. Like, almost, like, back. I moved the mic,

30
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:25,550
so it was like, okay, um, you know in Blade 2, you know, that big, huge beanbag chair, fat, vampire, alien guy?

31
00:03:26,069 --> 00:03:28,500
That's how we're streaming today.

32
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:42,159
Oh, that's nothing. That's just research. That's just a video game, huh? Hit him with the UV light.

33
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:45,680
That's what we're doing. Just don't burn me, please.

34
00:03:46,039 --> 00:04:07,979
Are there any essential viewing movies? What do you mean? Oh, I don't know if Blade 2 is an essential required reading movie.

35
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:11,539
It's just a movie that I watched 15 years ago.

36
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:23,699
That's like the, what the hell is this? I think one of the only, that's, that's Rodney Dangerfield.

37
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:31,540
You did like a, you did a face swap thing with Rodney Dangerfield.

38
00:04:38,389 --> 00:04:49,769
I got no respect. I'll tell you what I came up. That's Rodney Dangerfield, right?

39
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:02,480
We're, we're hooing Rodney Dangerfield. Well, I guess that makes sense considering he, he, none of you,

40
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,160
that's not me. That's a, that is a face

41
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:22,230
morphing software of me and you put Rodney Dangerfield's face on here, and it's very funny. If you play

42
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:30,430
Tungless this stream, I'll sub for a whole year. I don't feel like I don't want to type that into Google, so no.

43
00:05:31,029 --> 00:05:41,569
It's a real picture of you off of CBD.

44
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:48,970
He's been dead for 16 years. Kind of normal for a lot of people to have no idea who he is.

45
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:52,439
Yeah, sometimes I talk to you guys as if

46
00:05:53,079 --> 00:06:01,120
you're not, you know, in your mid to late 30s. Oh my god, I can't believe you guys, that's Rodney Dangerfield.

47
00:06:01,579 --> 00:06:05,670
Like, I may as well say like Charlie Chaplin for a lot of you guys.

48
00:06:06,149 --> 00:06:18,639
I'm gonna just give 50 bucks. But you guys don't, you, you, everyone knows who Charlie Chaplin is. They teach that in like the first grade.

49
00:06:25,189 --> 00:06:27,189
JPQPlays gave

50
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:30,990
5,000 bits, 50 bucks right at the beginning of the stream. We haven't even done anything.

51
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:32,990
You don't even know if this stream is worth 50 dollars.

52
00:06:33,269 --> 00:06:37,490
Haven't done anything yet.

53
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:39,490
But thanks a lot, JPQ.

54
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:46,519
They say, hey Jeremy, you're my favorite streamer and extremely inspirational. Also, most of the community is awesome. I agree.

55
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:52,019
Well, but the second part, not that like I'm like you, well, yeah, thank you.

56
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:55,120
Most of.

57
00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:05,209
Yes, you can say most of, because that's like going into the grocery store, and at any moment in the grocery store,

58
00:07:05,649 --> 00:07:08,529
you could be surrounded by like murderers.

59
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:13,769
If there's a hundred people in your grocery store, five of them might be a serial killer. You don't know that.

60
00:07:14,209 --> 00:07:17,379
You can't walk, you can't just scream in the, in the grocery store.

61
00:07:17,819 --> 00:07:21,699
All of you are awesome, and everyone here is so, is awesome.

62
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:29,069
The guy that like has four people buried hears you say that, and he's like, oh nice. All right. I'm good.

63
00:07:29,589 --> 00:07:40,930
Can't, you can't make a statement like that. Like the dude that has the, his fourth salsa in his pants,

64
00:07:41,209 --> 00:07:46,430
stealing from the grocery store, hears you say that. Oh, all right. I'm in the clear.

65
00:07:47,029 --> 00:07:52,370
Can't make a blanket, there's no blanket statements here. Most of you, because I don't know all of you.

66
00:07:56,459 --> 00:08:04,610
Spike889 just gave five community subs, thanks for the subs dude. It's chunky or smooth. What do you mean smooth salsa?

67
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:07,810
Smooth salsa is just pizza sauce.

68
00:08:08,449 --> 00:08:19,779
It's restaurant salsa.

69
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:30,500
Smooth salsa. How do you know that most of us are not serial killers? I don't know that. I have no idea who you are.

70
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:36,600
Like every president of the United States could be watching this right now. I don't know.

71
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:45,690
Jimmy Carter could be here right now. I don't know. It's possible. He's just on the toilet with his phone.

72
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:55,029
I can't wait for bug sacks. That's possible. I don't know. What about George Washington?

73
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:58,600
Yeah, George Washington in his coffin.

74
00:08:58,919 --> 00:09:07,240
He had, he had an iPad slot built into his coffin, and he could always have German985 on it, on his iPad,

75
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,120
on his coffin iPad.

76
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:22,639
What a shitty afterlife. What do you mean after life?

77
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,639
I just like implied that there is no afterlife.

78
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:36,879
Whoops.

79
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:40,159
Sorry. Sorry. I'm sorry. I didn't, what I meant to say was,

80
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:44,919
what I meant to say was, oh no, what do I do? What do I do now? How do I get out of here?

81
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,779
How do I, how do I move away from what I just said?

82
00:09:49,299 --> 00:09:57,539
Somebody said, hey German, do you want my paycheck? No. You spend your paycheck on you. You want to throw me a couple of coins?

83
00:09:57,539 --> 00:09:59,940
I will probably catch them.

84
00:10:05,879 --> 00:10:11,759
Play the damn game. Hey, I'm just relaxing, man. I'm lying back like the, like the zombie in Blade 2.

85
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:13,960
I told you, I'm gonna, I'm gonna relax a mood today.

86
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,399
This is gonna be so chill.

87
00:10:19,649 --> 00:10:24,210
Cognito Hazardous just gave $50. You guys have given me a hundred bucks, and I haven't even showed the game yet.

88
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:30,389
That's 5,000 more bits. He says,

89
00:10:30,909 --> 00:10:32,909
Wag baba boo boo.

90
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:45,509
All right. Thank you for the $50. That's based. True. What do you, I don't know what that means.

91
00:10:45,909 --> 00:10:48,549
Play the game. I'm gonna play. Can we just chill?

92
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:59,720
Eat bug on stream.

93
00:11:01,789 --> 00:11:05,929
Nah. Nah.

94
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:09,889
No, I can't. No, not today.

95
00:11:10,889 --> 00:11:15,440
Dreamer approves that God is a lie.

96
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:24,309
Didn't say anything. Just you, we took, guys, we were talking for George Washington watching my stream while he's dead in his coffin.

97
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:34,759
Guys, we're not like talking reality here. Where do we leave off? I forget.

98
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:55,759
Ew. Bugs. Turn it off. Blue-pilled. Okay. Stop reading chat. What, what do you mean stop reading?

99
00:11:55,759 --> 00:11:58,159
That's like the whole, that's like, that's like half the deal here.

100
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:10,519
Bugs and bug-pilled. Okay. All right. Philbo wants to talk to me. Where's Philbo? Oh, wait.

101
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:19,940
Stop reading.

102
00:12:23,779 --> 00:12:25,779
What is wrong, what's wrong with him?

103
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,580
Why's that dude, that dude's on drugs.

104
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,320
He's sleepwalking?

105
00:12:50,529 --> 00:12:53,009
I'll take a glass of air. No ice, please.

106
00:12:53,889 --> 00:12:58,049
Do you have anything? No. What do you mean? You didn't even serve any.

107
00:12:59,009 --> 00:13:05,090
Apparently not. Apparently you're not going to serve any of these drinks.

108
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,440
Hey, get up. Wait.

109
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:18,039
Wait, if you wake up people that are sleepwalking, can't you instantly kill them? You sever their spinal cord or something, right?

110
00:13:18,679 --> 00:13:25,139
Isn't that, isn't that possible? Can you like kill somebody if you wake them up like out of a sleepwalk, like sleep like this?

111
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:30,179
That's a myth.

112
00:13:30,179 --> 00:13:31,220
You sure?

113
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:33,299
Thanks for waking me. Oh, you're welcome.

114
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:44,149
Another 50 bucks just came in. What are you guys doing today?

115
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:51,299
5,000 more bits from DonCad. Thank you DonCad for the 50 fucking dollars.

116
00:13:51,779 --> 00:13:56,639
Hey, Jerma, it's your weed guy. I've been outside for an hour and your phone goes straight to voicemail.

117
00:13:56,799 --> 00:13:58,960
Do you just want me to leave your in quote?

118
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,600
Nug snacks at the door.

119
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:22,279
You know how weird and awful and embarrassing that would be? If like the delivery, if I ordered food

120
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,639
and the delivery guy got here and like

121
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:32,600
knew who I was and like heard me scream bug snacks and they have this moment of realization where they're like,

122
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,759
holy shit.

123
00:14:34,759 --> 00:14:38,440
I am outside the door of this motherfucker right now.

124
00:14:41,169 --> 00:14:45,889
You know, imagine like, oh, I'm coming up to this delivery at this place. I'm just at a place just delivering food.

125
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:54,370
You'd be like, what the fuck are you, what?

126
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:57,139
Hold on. Like I was just, I was just watching him like

127
00:14:57,779 --> 00:15:00,019
I'm delivering this. No, that just can't be him.

128
00:15:00,659 --> 00:15:07,120
And he like, dude, you like comb your hair a little bit.

129
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,840
Here, I'm at his house. I'm here. I'm here.

130
00:15:12,789 --> 00:15:18,309
Hold on a second guys. The fucking delivery guy's here. I bet he's a fucking loser.

131
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:30,559
Hey, hey, thanks for the food, man. You're welcome. Yeah, Jerma.

132
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,440
Hey, what? What did you say?

133
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:39,600
I, uh, Jerma, I, uh, hey, um, I can't believe I, I can't believe I'm here.

134
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:43,490
All right. Thanks for the food. Slam!

135
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:55,649
Hey, the delivery guy recognized me. Oh my god, are you fucking kidding me? What's this bug do?

136
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:09,539
No tip.

137
00:16:09,539 --> 00:16:12,340
No, you tip through the app. You don't, what are you talking about?

138
00:16:18,389 --> 00:16:22,470
Yeah, and what he doesn't understand is he's going to look at that his phone and it's going to be like a

139
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:29,509
$200 tip and a message that says, hey man, thanks for being a part of the fucking bit. Thanks for playing along.

140
00:16:30,149 --> 00:16:33,000
Take care of yourself. Have a great rest of your night, man. Thanks for coming.

141
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:55,860
And then it turns out I didn't have any money left in my card.

142
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,639
And I write again.

143
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:05,400
Hey, dude, I'm wicked sorry, but, uh, like I bought a bunch of fucking shit on Amazon and

144
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:11,720
I like didn't realize that I didn't have that money in my account. Uh, thanks for, thanks for coming by though.

145
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:30,630
How do we even, oh, right. Like somebody said they were delivering weed to my house.

146
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:39,670
I kind of want to turn this down to a pretzel. Is that weird?

147
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:44,230
Somebody said that was a four out of ten bit.

148
00:17:45,349 --> 00:17:50,150
And we'll just get, it's been 18 minutes, man. There's going to be plenty more. Probably not though. I'm just like lying back in my chair.

149
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:57,140
It was a five out of ten maybe.

150
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:08,880
It was four out of ten. All right. Well, look, your favorite publisher comes out with like a five out of ten, six out of ten game

151
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:10,799
three times a year.

152
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:15,599
They make one good game like every five years and they're like a AAA company.

153
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,480
All right, cool. What are your thoughts on Bugsnapp?

154
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,720
We rarely get a ten out of ten bit from you.

155
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,359
Whatever. Good. There's no such thing as a ten out of ten.

156
00:18:48,529 --> 00:18:50,529
Voices were ten out of ten.

157
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:53,730
He's got a lot of that social anxiety.

158
00:18:54,369 --> 00:19:02,289
All right, where's Lisbeth? Lisbeth is top dog, you feel me? She really inspires me to test my limits.

159
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:05,250
But uh, that's about it.

160
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:07,410
I'm really tight with Egobel.

161
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:10,710
Your meatwad is getting better.

162
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:15,160
Is it?

163
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,160
Egobel's a sweetie.

164
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,160
Your ass is a ten out of ten bit.

165
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:21,559
That's not even my joke.

166
00:19:22,519 --> 00:19:28,119
That's okay. First of all, here's two parts to this. That's not my joke and I just have a huge ass.

167
00:19:28,359 --> 00:19:30,359
I didn't, that's not like a comedy routine.

168
00:19:31,519 --> 00:19:34,160
I just have a big fucking huge ass.

169
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,400
And somebody

170
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,240
enlarged it a little bit.

171
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,240
That's, I didn't do anything.

172
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:57,240
I just joined and he's bragging about his ass.

173
00:19:58,759 --> 00:20:02,920
Is it bragging or is it just me saying things about my body?

174
00:20:05,589 --> 00:20:08,150
Look, I didn't say guys, I have a huge fucking ass.

175
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,269
That's not what happened.

176
00:20:11,269 --> 00:20:13,759
I just said I have a huge ass.

177
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:25,670
I didn't say look at how huge my, I just said I have, all right, we're moving on.

178
00:20:28,839 --> 00:20:30,839
You really slam dunked my questions.

179
00:20:32,849 --> 00:20:39,200
And how am I supposed to drive the conversation away from my fucking giant

180
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,119
bulbous ass?

181
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:46,160
It's like half the images you guys link over the last two weeks.

182
00:20:50,049 --> 00:20:53,329
I'm just gonna ignore that this is what the community is currently on.

183
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:02,259
Shit, I was gonna just brag about that.

184
00:21:08,849 --> 00:21:11,029
All right, so let's go talk to Philbo.

185
00:21:11,509 --> 00:21:13,720
Oh, here they are, here are my snacks.

186
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,960
That's my favorite one right there so far.

187
00:21:16,869 --> 00:21:19,990
One thing I don't like about it is it has the stupid in-and-out wrapper on it.

188
00:21:20,549 --> 00:21:22,549
Because look at how old and retro it is.

189
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:25,890
Get a fucking full wrapper on that and stop putting

190
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
all the food in a half wrapper

191
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,720
in the bag at the drive-through.

192
00:21:33,079 --> 00:21:35,160
I, I hate that so much.

193
00:21:35,799 --> 00:21:37,000
It's like,

194
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:42,119
do you don't, I don't care that it's in a half wrapper in the bottom of the bag. Don't stop doing that.

195
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,640
Wrap it up. If it's, if it's not a to-go order, fine.

196
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,829
But if it's a to-go order,

197
00:21:50,069 --> 00:21:52,789
I don't want my burger out in the open in a

198
00:21:53,589 --> 00:21:55,589
half bag in the bottom of a bag.

199
00:21:56,849 --> 00:22:03,170
I'm sorry. If that's like a unpopular opinion, then I'm glad it is. I don't care. I hate that.

200
00:22:04,049 --> 00:22:10,440
Holy shit, what's going on?

201
00:22:11,559 --> 00:22:13,559
You're talking shit about in-and-out, bro?

202
00:22:15,299 --> 00:22:19,700
Yeah, of course, of course you're the type of guy that would be mad about that fucking chattler.

203
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:26,630
Oh, I have these, I have these bags.

204
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:29,240
Nutty snack pod. What should I do with these?

205
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:36,690
Should I, maybe I should feed one of these to somebody.

206
00:22:37,569 --> 00:22:39,730
All right, look, will you leave me alone if I give you one of these?

207
00:22:40,369 --> 00:22:45,109
Can we give him a nut nose?

208
00:22:46,759 --> 00:23:01,299
All right, we'll donate the other one. Oh, no, he doesn't look okay. He looks like he's kind of messed up.

209
00:23:03,319 --> 00:23:05,319
Somebody lift him up and put him in the corner.

210
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:11,700
Oh, can I do that?

211
00:23:12,519 --> 00:23:14,519
I can't help him. Somebody help him.

212
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:20,069
Oh, you guys weren't lying. You can actually pet them.

213
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:41,430
Oh, where are my other friends?

214
00:23:42,289 --> 00:23:44,849
How come these guys are locked up? They shouldn't be locked up like this.

215
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:52,769
Where's my favorite one?

216
00:23:52,769 --> 00:23:54,769
There you are. There's my favorite.

217
00:23:55,009 --> 00:24:03,880
I want to go pet my favorite.

218
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:07,319
You're a good pop dick. You're a good George Washington hair.

219
00:24:14,759 --> 00:24:16,759
Okay, let's go. Let's talk to Philbo.

220
00:24:23,559 --> 00:24:25,559
Forgot how odd this guy looked.

221
00:24:29,490 --> 00:24:40,799
Why do you want me to, why?

222
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:43,039
Something's wrong, buddy. We better take a look.

223
00:24:43,599 --> 00:24:49,380
That's a he well, what did you wait? What's this? I can open this. Can I I can open that what happened?

224
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:56,279
Somebody's dead. Somebody got killed.

225
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:11,400
This creature wearing a crown or perhaps holding some sort of ceremonial dagger

226
00:25:18,279 --> 00:25:25,000
You can't not laugh when you talk to some of these people scattered. How do they not laugh frankly? I find that hard to swallow

227
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:43,539
Drama zonk off. She just told this guy to zonk off drama

228
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:52,150
Get some grump and sleep grumble

229
00:25:55,650 --> 00:25:59,170
This is what this is when you make a student film and you don't know how to edit yet

230
00:26:04,789 --> 00:26:07,730
Everyone just do their lines

231
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:09,730
And I just go like this

232
00:26:15,089 --> 00:26:17,089
It doesn't even matter if they're looking at the camera

233
00:26:18,609 --> 00:26:25,970
All that if what bramble and beffica are saying is true. There's got to be some physical evidence left behind. Yeah

234
00:26:26,599 --> 00:26:30,839
Indeed we should tweak the perimeter and keep watch in case the creature returns

235
00:26:32,279 --> 00:26:37,349
Good idea buddy. Do you think you can scope out the restroom? You know find out what they saw

236
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:44,500
I didn't even know he was talking. Why do I have to investigate the bathroom every time?

237
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:50,579
Can you go look at the restroom and find out if I don't want to look at the bathroom anymore?

238
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,900
Wait, I'm also one of these things

239
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:55,559
What?

240
00:26:55,559 --> 00:26:57,559
I'm one of these things

241
00:26:57,559 --> 00:26:59,559
I am but how come I don't eat anything?

242
00:27:05,029 --> 00:27:07,059
Oh, I found something

243
00:27:07,059 --> 00:27:13,759
Found something a rusty spade discarded near the sign smells like snacks. I have an allergy

244
00:27:13,839 --> 00:27:18,480
Oh, I didn't what I knew I was like a I didn't know I was one of these like mutant muppet people

245
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:27,619
Oh, what's that?

246
00:27:27,619 --> 00:27:31,430
eggs eggs

247
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:33,750
rambel knits all of her own eggs

248
00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:39,599
Okay, cool. Um two out of six clues

249
00:27:47,329 --> 00:27:48,950
Oh this clue

250
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:50,309
footprints

251
00:27:50,309 --> 00:27:55,109
Messy paw like prince lead from one edge of snack burg to the garden

252
00:27:55,750 --> 00:28:01,380
What about what about you? It's you?

253
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:05,509
It's tiffany tiffany. Oh, no, you're just investigating. Okay

254
00:28:08,210 --> 00:28:09,569
Tiffany get out of the way

255
00:28:09,569 --> 00:28:14,230
Wait, what?

256
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:20,559
more paw prints

257
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:26,720
Even more paw prints bug prints bug snack tracks scatter from where the grumpus tracks stop

258
00:28:27,119 --> 00:28:32,819
We need another clue in the toilet

259
00:28:33,059 --> 00:28:44,150
What did I miss?

260
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:49,640
What did I miss?

261
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:55,269
It's a community shitter. Yeah, that is kind of gross

262
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:05,559
Oh, I see

263
00:29:05,559 --> 00:29:09,380
No more bug snacks. It's a warning

264
00:29:12,119 --> 00:29:15,190
Bilbo, where are you dude?

265
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:18,309
Yeah, they all go to the bathroom the same place. I mean I guess wait

266
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:24,099
That is not what you like your family does that it's not like weird

267
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:31,269
That is not like that weird if you live in a house with more than like two or three people that you go

268
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:41,599
You use the same toilets. It's not that weird, but every single one of you guys has a your own toilet in your own room

269
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:55,319
No, no, what no you don't who has more than like three or four bathrooms

270
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:06,950
I guess if you have like six bedrooms like four five six bathrooms. That's a lot. That's a lot of bathrooms

271
00:30:10,019 --> 00:30:12,180
All right. There are tracks that aren't quite grumpus

272
00:30:28,930 --> 00:30:30,930
Chat bourgeoisie

273
00:30:38,069 --> 00:30:43,589
Which is more likely that is so far unseen giant bug snack politely left a note on our door

274
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:49,269
Or that this is some form of coordinated gaslighting by the grump and what's more gaslighting dear?

275
00:30:49,269 --> 00:30:56,069
Is that the word of the day on this stream every day scientific data behind it? What is you haven't even drawn?

276
00:30:59,430 --> 00:31:04,519
Thank you. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. You know what? Let's split the difference. Eh, you're both wrong

277
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:08,900
He's got those like popsicle feet

278
00:31:11,890 --> 00:31:19,619
Becoming pretty unlivable who okay who who wore it best? All right, who's got the best out who's got the best mutated body snorpy?

279
00:31:19,619 --> 00:31:24,259
You were a lot safer. I know I have my favorite same goes for me and my little ones

280
00:31:24,579 --> 00:31:28,359
We shouldn't split up again. It's probably him

281
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,880
Or it's cooking marshmallow nose

282
00:31:36,789 --> 00:31:42,470
You don't know

283
00:31:44,599 --> 00:32:03,440
Yeah, I feel like I don't want to change him what's wrong with him we don't have lizberg each other maybe if we try

284
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:07,029
You'd all add up to one of her

285
00:32:08,309 --> 00:32:10,309
What are you implying that?

286
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:15,509
Like none of us all of us combined are like just barely as interesting or cool as lizbert

287
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:27,250
That's not putting that much confidence in us if you must according to the tracking device

288
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:32,019
I placed on them by boiling bay, which is that way the last time I saw shelda

289
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:39,059
She was meditating in the sizzling sands shelda. Don't forget about egobel if she's not with lizbert

290
00:32:39,059 --> 00:32:40,740
That's just

291
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:42,740
It's just the germa 985

292
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:51,759
Quote funny voice. I can't wait to play a legend of sheldon. How does that sound? Let's go get some sleep

293
00:32:51,920 --> 00:33:01,009
Okay, we got to find shelda

294
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:06,259
Yeah, he does take the cake search for the search the frosted peak

295
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:08,339
mountain climb

296
00:33:08,339 --> 00:33:11,720
ooh

297
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,720
All right. So let's take a look

298
00:33:14,519 --> 00:33:20,599
We got a few people that we got find shelda find floof d and then climb the mountain

299
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:25,700
Floof d is in the boiling bay shelda is in the sizzling sands

300
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:32,640
We just gotta keep going where where we got those are two places that we have not seen

301
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:37,000
So how do we get to the sizzling sands? Didn't he go that way?

302
00:33:42,079 --> 00:33:45,359
Sizzling sands. That's okay. This is shimmering springs

303
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:50,900
We go down to shimmering springs and maybe over to sizzling sands

304
00:33:51,539 --> 00:33:54,319
Wait, there's a I want to open though. There's a hut down here. I want to open

305
00:33:54,880 --> 00:34:00,390
That's the d sands

306
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:03,250
sands

307
00:34:03,329 --> 00:34:04,529
Sands

308
00:34:04,529 --> 00:34:11,190
That's you saying the d is weird sizzling sands sands

309
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:18,929
The d is silent when you say sands sand

310
00:34:20,119 --> 00:34:21,320

335
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:04,800
Set it up right here

336
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:08,639
And then we're gonna aim it this way

337
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,000
And fire

338
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,420

Trip shot. All right, but hold on. Wait, can I go? All right. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait

373
00:40:14,130 --> 00:40:16,130

432
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:11,050
Let me see. Hold on a muddy projector tape

433
00:45:11,530 --> 00:45:15,690
Okay, here we go. Looks like I need to weigh down the pressure plates in order first left

434
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:21,320
Then right then center and after that push down hard on all three

435
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:25,079
All right

436
00:45:25,079 --> 00:45:27,130

439
00:45:37,050 --> 00:45:40,730
That means that you just you so quickly tried to rush that out

440
00:45:43,420 --> 00:45:45,980
At i'm assuming it's not very high effort

441
00:45:46,619 --> 00:45:53,460
Okay. Well, I know the I know the code now the puzzle

442
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:59,349

I can grab it. Okay

448
00:46:25,610 --> 00:46:27,610

00:47:58,139 --> 00:48:05,269
How do I smash this thing? There's got to be a smasher bug here somewhere

465
00:48:06,539 --> 00:48:08,059
Are you a smasher?

466
00:48:08,059 --> 00:48:15,539

492
00:50:58,280 --> 00:51:00,280
Okay. I need two more

493
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:02,760

494
00:51:13,590 --> 00:51:17,909

495
00:51:17,909 --> 00:51:18,869

A contrarian if you want you call me a contrarian fine. These are cooler than pokemons

498
00:51:29,369 --> 00:51:34,360
Oh, there's nothing I want to get rid of. All right, one of the sodas

My body has changed into more cocoa. So if okay, can you even comprehend what has happened?

505
00:52:22,969 --> 00:52:28,730
We just deleted two sodas for no reason each one could change it to any other with the right stimulus

506
00:52:29,449 --> 00:52:32,329
And now that is true of me now use this

572
00:59:15,429 --> 00:59:17,670
We should be thanking that guy. He was trying to help us the whole time

573
00:59:18,900 --> 00:59:20,900

00:59:44,650 --> 00:59:45,769

01:00:05,539 --> 01:00:07,539
Threshold of crumpusness

01:00:07,539 --> 01:00:11,139
When every cell of my body is bug snacks stabbing hand

583
01:00:12,579 --> 01:00:14,579
It's an anti-vampire hand

584
01:00:17,460 --> 01:00:19,460
I must find out

585
01:00:23,909 --> 01:00:28,550
The answers won't come to me without further testing. However, I have exhausted my research

586
01:00:34,329 --> 01:00:36,329
Every stream is a wild stream by the way

587
01:00:37,849 --> 01:00:40,539
I look forward to working with you further

588
01:00:41,610 --> 01:00:43,849
All right. We got uh floofies going back to snack bird

589
01:00:45,179 --> 01:00:48,070
Our work here is done

590
01:00:48,070 --> 01:00:50,389
But not quite because there's still a couple things I want to get

591
01:00:51,030 --> 01:00:56,570
What did I not get here?

592
01:00:56,570 --> 01:00:58,570
Well, it's nighttime now. So there might be some new bugs

593
01:00:59,130 --> 01:01:00,940
to look for

594
01:01:00,940 --> 01:01:03,059
possible

595
01:01:03,059 --> 01:01:05,400

01:01:11,690 --> 01:01:14,730
Why is the soda giving me the double middle finger emoji?

599
01:01:15,369 --> 01:01:31,050
What's going on here?

600
01:01:31,050 --> 01:01:33,050
Stop fighting. Stop it

602
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:45,159
You guys all right? Why are you being so mean? Aren't you guys friends?

603
01:01:45,960 --> 01:01:55,099
Why did I get involved?

604
01:01:55,099 --> 01:01:57,320
This guy's getting stomped

605
01:01:57,320 --> 01:02:00,570
Are they falling asleep?

606
01:02:00,570 --> 01:02:03,289
You don't need more of these. All right. All right. I don't need them

In your room or in your house and you really feel like the thing's trying to kill you

01:02:16,300 --> 01:02:18,219
This thing is trying to kill me

01:02:18,219 --> 01:02:20,699
It's following me around. It's really pissed off

613

Why did you do that?

617
01:02:44,070 --> 01:02:46,409
Is he dead?

618
01:02:46,409 --> 01:02:49,210
Oh shit, he's dead guys. He's completely dead

619
01:02:52,039 --> 01:02:54,360

Okay, what are these things?

625
01:03:28,409 --> 01:03:30,409
These things look like they could be interacted with

626
01:03:31,500 --> 01:03:34,940
Oh left. Wait, wait, wait. What's what is it? It's left

627
01:03:36,099 --> 01:03:37,300

Where's shanandorf and shink where's she

656
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:44,800
Link

657
01:07:52,159 --> 01:07:54,159
Shenandoah

658
01:07:54,880 --> 01:08:00,320
That what you just described you just described like a girl named shannon

659
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:06,360
That has like a cosplay instagram account and she dresses up as ganondorf

660
01:08:07,349 --> 01:08:10,630
And it's hashtag shanandorf and it's really good

661
01:08:11,510 --> 01:08:16,949
It's very good. You're like, holy shit. That's pretty good. I'll let you get away with the shanandorf

662
01:08:17,569 --> 01:08:21,479
I'm seeking inner peace

663
01:08:21,720 --> 01:08:25,420
Shelder has renounced material temptations

664
01:08:26,279 --> 01:08:30,359
So it is that shelter is really grumping hungry

665
01:08:31,079 --> 01:08:35,239
Seek the yellow sauce within the great maw of stone

666
01:08:36,279 --> 01:08:39,260
On this I shall be sustained

667
01:08:41,460 --> 01:08:45,319
Your viewers just spiraled it down when you said shanandorf

668
01:08:47,430 --> 01:08:51,189
Why no, I didn't. All right. What do I don't get cheese sauce for shelda?

That person's name is now shida

671
01:08:58,680 --> 01:09:01,399
I can't say shelda without shanandorf and like

672
01:09:02,119 --> 01:09:05,930
Shink and like the the shriforce of shrurge

673
01:09:06,789 --> 01:09:09,439
What's that?

674
01:09:09,439 --> 01:09:14,039
It's a burrito

675
01:09:14,039 --> 01:09:19,079
As long as it's under the sand it can't be caught but it can't dig through solid rock. Ooh. All right good clue

676
01:09:20,159 --> 01:09:22,479
More importantly though. I want to see the praying mantis

677
01:09:27,489 --> 01:09:31,250
What the hell a large aggressive and destructive a void

678
01:09:31,970 --> 01:09:36,800
This that is insane looking. Hold on

679
01:09:40,770 --> 01:09:42,770
It's like a taco

680
01:09:42,850 --> 01:09:45,970
The Dorito face burrito praying mantis

681
01:09:55,170 --> 01:09:58,930
What is it? He he's afraid of the spuds, right? Okay. He's afraid of these things

682
01:10:01,109 --> 01:10:04,640
I gotta get cheese sauce first and foremost. Hold on. What is that thing?

683
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:07,199
score pepper

684
01:10:07,199 --> 01:10:10,579
Okay

685
01:10:10,579 --> 01:10:12,579
I want the big pizza moth, too

686
01:10:12,979 --> 01:10:17,399
All right, let's start first of all, let's get let's do this. Let's get the cheese sauce first

687
01:10:19,960 --> 01:10:23,000
But I need to I need to go back to town and get rid of this stuff

688
01:10:25,060 --> 01:10:28,819
I'm not gonna no overwhelming myself. I'm going back to town. I'm gonna donate

689
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:32,600
After I look at the top of the pyramid

690
01:10:32,600 --> 01:10:40,500
Okay, this is like the pizza pyramid. What is going on over here? These two are just fighting. That's a pancake bug

691
01:10:47,560 --> 01:10:52,369
Okay cheese. Oh, this is hot sauce. Where's the hell? I didn't pay attention. What do I get cheese?

692
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:55,279
cheese sauce

693
01:10:55,279 --> 01:11:03,960
Delta only eats cheese sauce. I will have to find some for her so that she doesn't waste away get the cheese sauce

694
01:11:07,359 --> 01:11:19,109
Beer cheese. All right, i'm going back to town. It's pancake flap. Wait, there's something in here, too

695
01:11:22,159 --> 01:11:24,159
So a sody d

696
01:11:25,909 --> 01:11:29,189
This liquidy bug lives in the oasis and won't tolerate the presence of sauce

697
01:11:30,840 --> 01:11:36,449
the sunny d

698
01:11:36,449 --> 01:11:38,600
sunny d

699
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:41,399
Drinking back your own heartburn that you burp up

700
01:11:42,279 --> 01:11:43,880
the flavor

701
01:11:43,880 --> 01:11:45,479
I love that one, too. I want that

702
01:11:45,479 --> 01:11:51,189
Somebody died over here. I can make a case. No, no go go just go

703
01:11:51,829 --> 01:12:10,069
Strawberry sunny d is good. I'm gonna have your paper in my hand and do a red line

704
01:12:12,470 --> 01:12:14,470
through half of your sentence

705
01:12:14,630 --> 01:12:17,300
So there's a red line through

706
01:12:17,380 --> 01:12:24,199
Strawberry there's a red line through is good and in red ink I write next to it is disgusting

707
01:12:25,640 --> 01:12:28,439
And I take there's a minus three points and you get like a 97

708
01:12:31,359 --> 01:12:34,840
Hey, bro, just got done fixing up the old bridge

709
01:12:35,560 --> 01:12:40,279
Would have done it sooner, but crondo wanted me to pay him. Oh, this is where the bridge was. Okay

710
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:47,680

That seems kind of rare

716
01:13:10,659 --> 01:13:13,539
Why is it like you're all collectively pretending that shannon

717
01:13:14,260 --> 01:13:18,819
Dwarf was not easily the most clever hilarious well-delivered joke the germans ever made on this channel

718
01:13:18,819 --> 01:13:19,859
I didn't make it

719
01:13:19,859 --> 01:13:23,939
You're lying to yourself if you claim that you didn't throw you into a laughing fit lasting 10 minutes

720
01:13:24,180 --> 01:13:28,100
Derma works hard on this channel for us and it definitely showed with the shannon dwarf joke

721
01:13:28,500 --> 01:13:30,500
I didn't that that's not mine

722
01:13:30,579 --> 01:13:35,699
I can barely even see my screen from the laughing tears that blind me as I type this be better

723
01:13:37,279 --> 01:13:40,079
Nobody in chat said that I didn't I just I reacted to it

724
01:13:41,119 --> 01:13:52,529
All right. I'm gonna donate all this

725
01:13:52,529 --> 01:13:58,279

I can't change you you have to stay that way you on the other hand

01:15:51,380 --> 01:15:58,520
You know, you're fine. Everyone has like a quest for me, but it's I gotta focus

743
01:16:01,090 --> 01:16:03,090
same thing

744
01:16:03,729 --> 01:16:06,979
Maybe your whole premise is flawed from the get-go

745
01:16:08,359 --> 01:16:09,960
Snacks aren't like plants

746
01:16:09,960 --> 01:16:11,960
He's got two normie limbs left

747
01:16:17,670 --> 01:16:24,710
Right, it's just um, you keep trying this over and over you can't it can't be like that. It has to be different and weird

748
01:16:25,350 --> 01:16:35,619
If that's how you choose to look at it. All right for asking, but would you that's a great question

749
01:16:35,699 --> 01:16:38,979
The answer I don't know. I can't even answer just all right time that person off

750
01:16:39,619 --> 01:16:45,699

I want to okay. Let's mess with his face

756
01:17:13,010 --> 01:17:18,210
He's been he's been like this for a long time. Just give me every sort of bug snack that digs underground

757
01:17:18,689 --> 01:17:21,250
I reckon it might aerate the soil or

758
01:17:21,890 --> 01:17:25,170
something

759
01:17:25,170 --> 01:17:28,289
I must lose one more score

760

761
01:17:35,810 --> 01:17:37,810
I gotta believe in myself

762
01:17:38,449 --> 01:17:42,850
It's that or or nothing aerate the soil

763
01:17:43,489 --> 01:17:46,449
All right. I'm changing. Let's change you a little snack experiment

01:22:48,359 --> 01:22:50,119
The end of the roll

824
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:59,000
You go through the the front part the end of the sub roll has this

bunched up bunch of cheese

826
01:23:02,739 --> 01:23:10,470
In the very end of the roll and there's just a little bit of meat in there and it's the best part

827
01:23:17,970 --> 01:23:20,369
Like vh1 is the best thing I ever ate

828
01:23:24,449 --> 01:23:31,010

01:23:37,829 --> 01:23:43,090
Just like super cut me into that show he wants to fuck a sandwich

830
01:23:44,710 --> 01:23:48,390
I don't want to fuck a sandwich if that's what you got from this

831
01:23:49,270 --> 01:23:53,989
You all by the way, by the way, I got a store. I don't care what he's saying

832
01:23:54,069 --> 01:23:55,350
I have a story for you

833
01:23:55,350 --> 01:24:00,149
Remember when I played lego star wars and I told you guys i'm playing lego star wars right now

834
01:24:00,149 --> 01:24:03,590
I have to stop like saying fuck and stuff like that, right? Because like this is like a kid's game

835
01:24:03,989 --> 01:24:05,989
Okay, my nieces and nephews

836
01:24:06,630 --> 01:24:09,189
Love lego star wars. It's like their favorite thing in the world

837
01:24:09,829 --> 01:24:12,239
And I got a text

838
01:24:12,239 --> 01:24:14,340
from my parents

839
01:24:14,340 --> 01:24:16,340
And from my sister

840
01:24:16,659 --> 01:24:17,939
that said

841
01:24:17,939 --> 01:24:19,380
Hey, um

842
01:24:19,380 --> 01:24:25,939
Just want to let you know the kids were watching your stream because they love lego star wars and we had to mute you

843
01:24:26,260 --> 01:24:28,260
Because you kept saying fuck so much

844
01:24:30,869 --> 01:24:33,189
It's like oh my god. Why did you do that?

845
01:24:35,250 --> 01:24:39,250
The kids love lego star wars. It's like their favorite thing in the world right now, apparently

846
01:24:40,529 --> 01:24:43,810
And I would have to I had to been like the only person on twitch playing that game

847
01:24:44,369 --> 01:24:49,909
I was swearing a lot and like I think they were watching during the swamp section

848
01:24:51,619 --> 01:24:53,359
so

849
01:24:53,359 --> 01:24:54,479
oh

850
01:24:54,479 --> 01:25:00,399
You could see my maybe my surprise and my embarrassment when I know that like my family is gathering around the fire

851
01:25:00,720 --> 01:25:03,920
And putting uncle up on the screen while I freak the fuck out

852
01:25:04,640 --> 01:25:09,600
At a children's lego game that they all love that i'm losing my mind over it like you have to yes

853
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:18,020
Just think about how I may have felt when I was told that I was salvaging. That's a community service pal

854
01:25:18,260 --> 01:25:20,260
and I said on that stream

855
01:25:21,140 --> 01:25:23,140
Maybe actually be careful because

856
01:25:24,100 --> 01:25:29,859
This is a kid's game

857
01:25:32,180 --> 01:25:34,500
Everyone here thinks she's so great

858
01:25:36,979 --> 01:25:39,510
Oh

859
01:25:39,510 --> 01:25:43,670
Man, I I gotta grow up. I gotta grow up a little bit. I think that's the wake up call

860
01:25:43,750 --> 01:25:46,949
It's time to grow up, right? I gotta grow up. I'm like in my 30s. I gotta grow up

861
01:25:49,380 --> 01:25:54,739
So I think that's the catalyst. That's it. That's elizabeth mega fake when push came to shove

862
01:25:56,899 --> 01:25:58,899
Omega little time to grow up

863
01:26:01,319 --> 01:26:04,760
What about peter pan isn't peter pan like 60

864
01:26:08,449 --> 01:26:11,329
How old is peter pan missing you do the math

865
01:26:12,760 --> 01:26:16,760
I bet liz and egg are living large in new grump city by now

866
01:26:18,420 --> 01:26:21,779
like in in the actual lore peter pan was like a

867
01:26:22,420 --> 01:26:27,460
Kid who never grew up and he never grew old and he was peter pan and he could fly

868
01:26:28,579 --> 01:26:30,579
Right. He was like 65 years old

869
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:42,819
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, i'm not the nicest grumpus around. I learned early on that life is like a box of trash

870
01:26:43,239 --> 01:26:45,239
You always know what you're gonna get

871
01:26:45,720 --> 01:26:47,810
A trash man

872
01:26:47,810 --> 01:26:53,569

875
01:27:08,479 --> 01:27:20,739
Oh, I did see that. I didn't let me pick it up though. I need to grow up. Also peter pan lore is cool, right?

876
01:27:21,300 --> 01:27:23,539
I never said it was cool. I just said it was a fact

877
01:27:30,609 --> 01:27:34,710
Toys r us don't grow up

878
01:27:35,109 --> 01:27:38,310
No toys r us don't grow up toys r us just go out of business

879
01:27:42,949 --> 01:27:45,800

Why you should have good manners at the dinner table and eating fruits and apples is good for you

904
01:30:09,880 --> 01:30:17,039
Why does everything have to have a song?

01:30:17,039 --> 01:30:20,880
Should we have should I make a song about how like cleaning up after playing with your toys is a good idea?

that is

909
01:30:42,210 --> 01:30:43,829
flavor falls

Okay, so they watched it muted

916
01:31:29,880 --> 01:31:31,880
But don't you think it's worse?

917
01:31:32,279 --> 01:31:36,560
With this being muted. I don't think you would want to watch this muted

918
01:31:37,279 --> 01:31:45,840
That's makes it strange and scary. It's scary

919
01:31:48,149 --> 01:31:54,529
Okay, we're at flavor I almost said flavor flave peak because you got in my mind we're going to go this way

He was like, I know they're trying to kill me. Let them do it

Where's the mustard? How have I not found that yet?

1021
01:43:28,369 --> 01:43:30,369
Second they grow they are taken

1022
01:43:30,369 --> 01:43:36,310
That's what you eat for dinner. I actually don't like ketchup that much

1023
01:43:36,949 --> 01:43:41,729
I like ketchup as a dipper not as something that's on uh food

1024
01:43:44,560 --> 01:43:46,800
I'm not i'd rather i'd rather

1025
01:43:47,520 --> 01:43:53,760
Be the one that rules the destiny of when and where ketchup is applied. I don't want it pre-applied to anything

1026
01:43:54,239 --> 01:43:56,239
I want to be the one to make that choice

1027
01:43:56,630 --> 01:43:58,630
I like it, but I don't want it on something

1028
01:43:58,930 --> 01:43:59,909
predetermined

1029
01:43:59,909 --> 01:44:03,399
Okay, I almost got full

1030
01:44:03,399 --> 01:44:11,760
I feel the same way about mustard too

1031
01:44:11,760 --> 01:44:17,409
Because it's here's the thing. It's really easy to overpower the hell out of whatever you're eating

1032
01:44:18,399 --> 01:44:22,079
If somebody applies ketchup that's too much ketchup than you wanted it's over

1033
01:44:23,170 --> 01:44:26,369
And don't tell me just scrape it off that it ruins the whole experience

1034
01:44:27,010 --> 01:44:31,970
Because then like the bun or the whatever the thing is already wet and kind of weird and soggy and it has that weird

1035
01:44:32,289 --> 01:44:33,970
coating of

1036
01:44:33,970 --> 01:44:37,090
No, okay. I've got 20 20 20 20 20

1037
01:44:37,729 --> 01:44:43,779
Same thing with salad dressing too. Give me the salad dressing on the side. Don't ever dress my salad for me

1038
01:44:43,779 --> 01:44:49,810
I will flip out want something I will flip out and I will fucking slap the thing down to the ground and I will

1039
01:44:49,810 --> 01:44:54,550
Throw it behind my shoulder

1040
01:44:59,239 --> 01:45:02,460
Okay, it's like omega low privileged

1041
01:45:04,770 --> 01:45:07,649
Oh that has salad dressing on it. Get it away from me

1042
01:45:10,449 --> 01:45:16,689
That's the ultimate that's the ultimate you spelt my name wrong on the starbucks cup privileged asshole, right?

1043
01:45:17,170 --> 01:45:19,170
Like do I really care that much?

1044
01:45:20,949 --> 01:45:24,010
Uh, my name is uh, jeremy not uh jeremie

1045
01:45:25,670 --> 01:45:27,670
Um, I don't know who the fuck that is

1046
01:45:27,750 --> 01:45:31,840
All right. Where am I going? Right back to the peak

1047
01:45:38,579 --> 01:45:39,859
Jaron

1048
01:45:39,859 --> 01:45:40,819
I don't people. All right

1049
01:45:40,819 --> 01:45:43,460
I don't know why people get so bent out of shape about shit, man

1050
01:45:43,539 --> 01:45:46,899
Like people get so mad and so annoyed over such little dumb things

1051
01:45:59,670 --> 01:46:04,949
Oh like you yeah, like you like you can't beat like a children's puzzle. So you curse out the developers of the video game

1052
01:46:05,750 --> 01:46:11,729
Fuck. Oh, that's not the same. That's not the same

1053
01:46:13,590 --> 01:46:17,590
You don't like ketchup. You just want to rant about how gross ketchup was and like get it off my fucking bun

1054
01:46:17,590 --> 01:46:20,470
Let me do it myself. Yeah, but it's different though. It's different because it's me

1055
01:46:21,109 --> 01:46:24,439
right

1056
01:46:24,439 --> 01:46:28,840
If it were you I would say that you're an asshole, but if it's me, okay

1057
01:46:28,920 --> 01:46:35,170
It's me so who doesn't I don't i'm not any no one can say anything to me. You know, it's really sad

1058
01:46:35,170 --> 01:46:37,170
That's like why the world is so fucked up

1059
01:46:42,229 --> 01:46:44,229
Who the fuck are you you shouldn't be here

1060
01:46:45,029 --> 01:46:46,390
It's not safe

1061
01:46:46,390 --> 01:46:49,350
You need to get off this mountain for the sake of your health and well-being

1062
01:46:50,310 --> 01:46:55,079
Trust me. I'm a doctor. Why is the dynamite strapped to you? What is that?

1063
01:46:55,720 --> 01:46:58,659
If another earthquake strikes

1064
01:46:58,739 --> 01:47:02,630
It'll cause an avalanche if you're up here when that happens

1065
01:47:03,189 --> 01:47:07,460
You'll be buried in snow and if you don't die from blunt force trauma

1066
01:47:08,020 --> 01:47:13,010
You'll asphyxiate

1067
01:47:13,010 --> 01:47:15,250
You I know you you're egg bell

1068
01:47:16,050 --> 01:47:20,130
Oh, oh you're the reporter the one liz was always talking about yes

1069
01:47:20,210 --> 01:47:23,810
You're that character in the germa 985 universe that we brought back to kill

1070
01:47:24,210 --> 01:47:39,699
To make sure he would never have to show up ever again in any form of future media. Where's liz what happened to her interview?

1071
01:47:40,180 --> 01:47:45,880
We were exploring the mountain there was an earthquake got separated

1072
01:47:46,680 --> 01:47:49,300
How can I help back home? Okay

1073
01:47:49,939 --> 01:47:51,939

1074
01:47:52,100 --> 01:47:54,899
Please hope nobody heard that don't tell anybody i'm up here

1075
01:47:57,829 --> 01:48:04,310
Oh a real bad place to say that in a giant echoing chasm where I can scream out here and it'll echo everywhere

1076
01:48:04,390 --> 01:48:06,390
We follow oh I have to follow you

1077
01:48:30,100 --> 01:48:31,300

Come on egg. You can figure this out. Just think like liz

1079
01:48:39,380 --> 01:48:43,619
Ha stop sneaking up on me or i'll quarantine you

1080
01:48:44,500 --> 01:48:45,380
What?

1081
01:48:45,380 --> 01:48:52,210
Well, it's a big mysterious door. How do you walk on that leg? There's some kind of weird lock on it

1082
01:48:52,930 --> 01:48:57,729
I feel like that's on there with scotch tape. I don't know what happened to our notes. You kind of just rag that don't you swear

1083
01:48:58,289 --> 01:49:01,560
I just need to get into liz's head space

1084

Oh that i've explored every area. All right notes on the mountain map

1092
01:49:38,409 --> 01:49:48,260
There's some kind of weird lock on it

1093
01:49:49,060 --> 01:49:51,939
Liz figured it out, but i've almost got it. I swear

1094
01:49:55,510 --> 01:49:59,590
Find the journal find the note find the notes find the notes on the mountain map shit

1095
01:50:00,710 --> 01:50:02,710
I know how to get in one

1096

two

1097
01:50:04,649 --> 01:50:07,449
Three I could have just figured this out on my own without any puzzles or anything

1098
01:50:08,390 --> 01:50:14,979
I have them

1099
01:50:14,979 --> 01:50:18,420
Notes on the mountain map. I don't have the mountain map. I have this which is probably

1100
01:50:19,060 --> 01:50:29,689
You just skipped over everything you need

1101
01:50:31,479 --> 01:50:33,479

But what's going on? I didn't pick this up yet. Whatever it was in boiling bay. It's beyond our help

1107
01:50:59,560 --> 01:51:01,560
Use the code code

1108
01:51:02,329 --> 01:51:03,529
the code

1109
01:51:03,529 --> 01:51:07,829
What's happening?

1110
01:51:07,829 --> 01:51:10,090
Yep, I just

1111
01:51:10,090 --> 01:51:12,250
Yeah, left right and middle, but how do I?

1112
01:51:14,970 --> 01:51:16,300
left

1113
01:51:16,300 --> 01:51:19,100
I have the code, but how do I weigh these down?

1114
01:51:26,979 --> 01:51:36,359
I need three grumpuses. We'll go stand on it. I can't do this right now

1115
01:51:38,250 --> 01:51:41,050
Go find the last paper. Yeah, that's what i'm talking about

1116
01:51:42,939 --> 01:51:47,020
We're all these all these shit talkers in chat. All these shit talkers don't understand

1117
01:51:47,579 --> 01:51:56,680
I need to go get the other note find the notes on the mountain map. What are you talking about?

1118
01:51:57,239 --> 01:51:59,239
Look at all these shit talkers

1119
01:51:59,239 --> 01:52:04,539
It looks like it might take at least three grumpuses to activate them. I don't have three. We have two

1120
01:52:06,460 --> 01:52:10,939
Here's the I lie. Here's the code looks like I need to weigh down the pressure plates. I know that

1121
01:52:11,659 --> 01:52:16,060
I don't have three grumpuses and I have not gone to boiling bay to get this last clue

1122
01:52:17,750 --> 01:52:23,699
God what about the keys?

1123
01:52:24,659 --> 01:52:26,659

Idiot you have the code. You're stupid

1129
01:52:56,819 --> 01:53:07,739
Yeah, you didn't know we needed three grumpuses, but more importantly i'm catching some of these snack pusses

1130
01:53:10,300 --> 01:53:11,960
All right. What do you want?

02:21:29,090 --> 02:21:39,459
I've been doing it for the last seven or eight in-game hours every cutscene. I've done this so

1352
02:21:40,340 --> 02:21:42,340

You're filming me

1362
02:23:36,260 --> 02:23:43,729
Filming the film that somebody else filmed like this. This is piracy. This is like, okay

Tarantino

1379
02:25:23,360 --> 02:25:44,340
Why do they have normal bodies?

1380
02:25:44,340 --> 02:25:46,979
There's no cinnamon buns on their noses and like hamburgers on their feet

1381
02:25:47,719 --> 02:25:50,340
This is before snacks. Oh

1382
02:26:09,649 --> 02:26:14,760
I thought she had the gun up. Why is she just pointing at me? Is it another gun?

02:26:42,549 --> 02:26:44,920
Oh

1386
02:26:45,649 --> 02:26:49,440
No, it's not this is not her house. This is like the movie theater

1387
02:26:50,559 --> 02:26:55,559

02:26:58,399 --> 02:27:00,399
Okay, I did I used all the keys

1389
02:27:00,639 --> 02:27:04,610
I don't care about what cromdo does at midnight. I care about

1390
02:27:05,170 --> 02:27:07,010
Opening the secret door

1391
02:27:07,010 --> 02:27:12,549
Okay, chandler would like to talk to you about something

1392
02:27:13,879 --> 02:27:19,079
Track the code. All right. I need to go to the the sizzling shimmering sizzler or whatever it is

1393
02:27:25,729 --> 02:27:27,649
We have to investigate

1394
02:27:27,649 --> 02:27:28,690

1395
02:27:28,690 --> 02:27:30,690

Yeah, we got across the bridge at uh, the

1397
02:27:36,159 --> 02:27:38,159
crusty gorge to the sizzling shore

1398
02:27:38,879 --> 02:27:58,229
Because all these names are almost identical. They just get open at the source you figure it out. Oh, okay. Here we go

1399
02:28:00,500 --> 02:28:02,930

You are so negative today germa these bug people are just trying to live their best life and you always put them down

1403
02:28:20,819 --> 02:28:32,020
It's pathetic because I wanted to be a bug snatch catcher when I was younger and I just didn't do it

1404
02:28:32,020 --> 02:28:41,879
All right, and watching these people do that and I wanted it. I wanted that I have to catch one of these

All right, that's a dangerous one though. That's a rare bug

We are in the right spot, right? Yeah. No, we're not we need to go to boiling bay

1434
02:31:06,180 --> 02:31:09,270

02:31:38,879 --> 02:31:40,799
Hey come get me you big alien

1440
02:31:40,799 --> 02:31:51,840
Told you that story, right?

1441
02:31:51,840 --> 02:31:53,840
how I went to disney world and

1442
02:31:54,479 --> 02:31:56,479
There was that scary ride with the alien

1443
02:31:56,799 --> 02:31:59,520
It was it was actually a terrifying experience. It was it like epcot

1444
02:32:00,159 --> 02:32:03,010
It was called like the alien or something alien encounter

1445
02:32:07,159 --> 02:32:11,000
I've told that story before yeah where I put I put my my thumbs in my eyes

1446
02:32:11,479 --> 02:32:14,040
No, I put my pinkies on my eyes and my thumbs in my ears

1447
02:32:14,520 --> 02:32:16,930
To make sure I didn't see or hear anything the whole ride

1448
02:32:17,489 --> 02:32:19,489
And then when it got like it gets like pitch black

1449
02:32:20,049 --> 02:32:22,340
before the alien breaks out

1450
02:32:22,340 --> 02:32:25,299
And right when it got pitch black my brother said

1451
02:32:25,940 --> 02:32:27,940

02:33:15,969 --> 02:33:19,809
I wish I could I want to play that so bad

1465
02:33:20,129 --> 02:33:29,030
Why won't you get off?

1466
02:33:29,030 --> 02:33:31,409
I'll just steal your egg then

1467
02:33:31,409 --> 02:33:32,930
Oh, there goes your egg

1468
02:33:32,930 --> 02:33:55,590
Okay, I I don't know. He won't come down. I need to launch him off. Hey, look at me. I'm so scary

1469
02:33:59,250 --> 02:34:01,250
Oh you dummy. All right now get over here

1470
02:34:03,110 --> 02:34:05,360
Right into my trap

1471
02:34:05,360 --> 02:34:09,360
Good. Good. Good. Good right in here. Oh, no. I'm in the water

1472
02:34:09,840 --> 02:34:10,879
Look out

1473
02:34:10,879 --> 02:34:14,049
Where'd he go?

1474
02:34:14,049 --> 02:34:17,010
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no this way. No, no, no, no, no this way this way

1475
02:34:17,090 --> 02:34:19,090
Okay, no, no, no, no, no this way this way this way this way this way

1476
02:34:20,770 --> 02:34:22,770
To me to me to me to me to me to me to me

1477
02:34:23,190 --> 02:34:41,760

1478
02:34:41,760 --> 02:34:43,760
It's just like stole that

1479
02:34:44,479 --> 02:34:46,079
I got a talk roach

1480
02:34:46,079 --> 02:34:57,159
Any more of those or did I fuck the whole thing up? Although, excuse me your favorite sauce is

1481
02:34:57,799 --> 02:34:59,799
Hot sauce. We're gonna get you to dive bomb this

1482
02:35:00,040 --> 02:35:03,040
What do you think about that?

1483
02:35:03,040 --> 02:35:29,780
Something down here bridge handle. Wait, is this done like a shortcut?

1484
02:35:32,450 --> 02:35:37,280
I bet I could use the snack grabber on this. I bet you could

1485
02:35:39,350 --> 02:35:43,059
Oh

1486
02:35:43,059 --> 02:35:47,829
Wait a minute any of the what's that?

1487
02:35:50,290 --> 02:35:53,110
Unique rasbee. It will need help escaping the underground

1488
02:35:56,229 --> 02:35:58,659
Okay, I can do that

1489
02:36:05,250 --> 02:36:15,729
Oh, well, i'll just get you black raspberry. Nice

1490
02:36:16,370 --> 02:36:21,729
Is there anything else down here that I haven't gotten?

1491
02:36:24,049 --> 02:36:31,030
A hall of scorpions is that that looks like it could be

1492
02:36:31,829 --> 02:36:36,530
Broken by something. I don't know what that means

1493
02:36:40,120 --> 02:36:47,010
I do know what that means

1494
02:36:47,010 --> 02:36:50,819
Where the hell is this?

1495
02:36:50,819 --> 02:36:55,809
The hall of scorpions. Oh shit. I'm about to collapse this whole thing

1496
02:37:00,290 --> 02:37:02,290
What does that do for me? Oh

1497
02:37:02,530 --> 02:37:11,409
Uh, I mean, that's I guess that's kind of cool

1498
02:37:12,290 --> 02:37:25,969
Oh

1499
02:37:25,969 --> 02:37:28,840
Nobody touched that

1500
02:37:28,840 --> 02:37:31,889
Okay you

1501
02:37:31,889 --> 02:37:53,299
You follow me got him. I want that thing too. I want to score. I want to I want a scorpion

1502
02:37:54,690 --> 02:37:56,709
Okay, so you

1503
02:37:56,709 --> 02:37:58,309
lurks invisibly and

1504
02:37:58,309 --> 02:38:32,420
I got a free pancake. I want that. That's the ultimate prize the supreme moth pizza. All right. I need to go

1505
02:38:33,379 --> 02:38:34,739
Where's the

1506
02:38:34,739 --> 02:38:37,110
Go back down here for a second

1507
02:38:37,110 --> 02:38:43,920
I feel like I missed a few things down here because I could go this way or I could go that way

1508
02:38:45,040 --> 02:38:56,360
Yep. All right. I'm up top

1509
02:38:56,360 --> 02:38:57,399
No

1510
02:38:57,399 --> 02:39:11,600
Is there anything else to do here?

1511
02:39:11,600 --> 02:39:22,879
No, you're desecrating ancient artifacts. It's a long way to save rocks. I want the cheese

1512
02:39:23,520 --> 02:39:34,870
I want the cheese puff. They were rocks those that wasn't an artifact. I didn't desecrate the scorpion things

1513
02:39:34,950 --> 02:39:36,950
I desecrated the rocks

1514
02:39:37,030 --> 02:39:42,219
There was just a bunch of wait. I didn't desecrate anything. Let's be clear. I didn't know there were no desecrations

1515
02:39:53,940 --> 02:40:00,040
I'm an opportunist

1516
02:40:00,040 --> 02:40:08,389
Oh, what's this? This pyramid is just rocks. No, the pyramid is a pyramid

1517
02:40:08,469 --> 02:40:16,319
That was the clearly just rocks in the way then I blew up the rocks. Is there where I need to go?

1518
02:40:16,479 --> 02:40:25,700
That's a little shortcut. Okay right here

1519
02:40:26,180 --> 02:40:29,649
Remember this I do

1520
02:40:29,649 --> 02:40:34,370
Already got these. All right. So now I gotta go to the bottom of this place. There's a little beach

1521
02:40:35,250 --> 02:40:39,319
Pick up the clue. It's down here

1522
02:40:40,200 --> 02:40:42,200
Love you, by the way. Love you

1523
02:40:44,129 --> 02:40:52,549
Down here. All right

1524
02:40:52,549 --> 02:40:55,360
Here it is. I already got it

1525
02:41:02,639 --> 02:41:16,370
Yeah, we but we told you that an hour ago, but um, we told you it was the other half of the code the paper

1526
02:41:28,579 --> 02:41:36,840
Okay, but how do I get a third person up there? I need to interview people. Oh

1527
02:41:37,319 --> 02:41:52,870
You must investigate and do interviews didn't I interview everybody already? Who have I not interviewed? I need to get shelda

1528
02:41:53,350 --> 02:42:09,250
This lady wants cheese sauce. I don't where am I supposed to get cheese sauce at cheese bay

1529
02:42:12,799 --> 02:42:14,959
You know, I have not picked up one of these guys yet

1530
02:42:16,040 --> 02:42:23,989
Very elusive. It's literally adjacent to her

1531
02:42:26,079 --> 02:42:32,610
Oh, well, I don't have time for that. You get it from chuck-e-cheese

1532
02:42:33,090 --> 02:42:37,329
You know chuck-e-cheese is a fun thing to say doesn't when you when you say the word chuck-e-cheese

1533
02:42:37,809 --> 02:42:43,590
Don't you think of a gross microwaved pizza? I just think of a pizza like a cheesy gross pizza

1534
02:42:44,149 --> 02:42:48,579
chuck-e-cheese

1535
02:42:48,579 --> 02:42:50,100
It's the ch

1536
02:42:50,100 --> 02:42:52,260
Followed by the ch, you know like chuck-e-cheese

1537
02:43:00,760 --> 02:43:03,399
I got lots of donations to give

1538
02:43:04,200 --> 02:43:06,200
And who am I who have I not interviewed?

1539
02:43:06,819 --> 02:43:09,459
I don't want to do what do you work for you who has not had an interview

1540
02:43:10,659 --> 02:43:16,659
These two haven't been interviewed, right? So you slithered back into town up to another grumpy naughty scheme

1541
02:43:17,219 --> 02:43:23,620
I'm not participating in your delusions brother. You waste your talented mind for a second. I was like, when did I feed this lady black olives?

1542
02:43:24,420 --> 02:43:26,579
Those are just glasses

1543
02:43:26,579 --> 02:43:30,180
What did I I don't know your moral compass and stop working for the man

1544
02:43:30,979 --> 02:43:38,819
Oh, please don't try to dress up your cowardice. I'm no coward. I you still haven't told the green meathead how you feel

1545
02:43:40,020 --> 02:43:42,420
Green meathead don't try to confuse the issue

1546
02:43:43,059 --> 02:43:47,459
I thought so lead me to my business and i'll leave you to yours. This is a minion

1547
02:43:51,190 --> 02:43:55,719
It is a minion don't have my secrets plastered all over the front page news

1548
02:43:57,879 --> 02:43:58,920
Okay

1549
02:43:58,920 --> 02:44:01,319
Let's interview one of the last two people we didn't interview

1550
02:44:03,559 --> 02:44:08,790
I suppose I can reveal a tad bit so long as my identity is protected

1551
02:44:11,799 --> 02:44:14,120
This game is really interesting because I could see where it was

1552
02:44:14,920 --> 02:44:17,159
Sort of created

1553
02:44:17,159 --> 02:44:19,559
It's like you're in the bath this person was in the bathtub

1554
02:44:20,930 --> 02:44:24,610
and they were just like kind of like kind of falling asleep in the bathtub and they're just like

1555
02:44:25,680 --> 02:44:32,000
Eating bugs that have food bases and you turn there's muppets with bugs for food. I'm gonna make it. Let's go

1556
02:44:32,159 --> 02:44:34,159
I think i'm uh, that's a great idea

1557
02:44:41,360 --> 02:44:43,360
That's dangerous

1558
02:44:43,840 --> 02:44:47,360
I don't mean like I don't mean sleeping in a bathtub. I mean like

1559
02:44:48,319 --> 02:44:50,319
You're just chilling

1560
02:44:50,959 --> 02:44:58,290
Redacted he thought I needed some fresh air or something much as I hate the outdoors. I simply can't say no to him

1561
02:45:05,649 --> 02:45:09,750
Do I talk like that I feel like I talk like that sometimes I get self-conscious

1562
02:45:11,250 --> 02:45:14,450
Do I do that? I probably do sometimes not all the time though

1563
02:45:15,010 --> 02:45:20,290
I surmise they are some sort of synthetic life form designed to beguile our taste buds

1564
02:45:21,559 --> 02:45:23,159
john oliver

1565
02:45:23,159 --> 02:45:30,479
I'm so glad you asked. I believe that maybe no, it's not john. Oliver hit it on this very island hidden somewhere deep underground

1566
02:45:31,040 --> 02:45:33,120
I have charts. Let me show you my charts later

1567
02:45:34,920 --> 02:45:39,860
I want to do it so bad. I don't I don't I was too exposed

1568
02:45:40,500 --> 02:45:45,459
Fluffy tried to wrap me up in their experiments now that lizbert and agabelle weren't around to occupy them

1569
02:45:46,180 --> 02:45:49,379
I could see that this was the next step in the grumpin otis plot against me

1570
02:45:49,459 --> 02:45:51,219
Stop interviewing this nerd and catch some bugs

1571
02:45:51,219 --> 02:45:55,299
I have to interview the nerd so then somebody one of the nerds will follow me up the mountain and stand on a plate

1572
02:45:55,299 --> 02:45:58,500
For me so I can open the door to go in one day

1573
02:45:58,819 --> 02:46:05,319
Do you really think those are all coincidences? I made that joke twice recently a joke

1574
02:46:06,360 --> 02:46:07,639
I don't

1575
02:46:07,639 --> 02:46:10,120
John oliver reference foolish bone in her body

1576
02:46:10,840 --> 02:46:15,239
She could rival me in wits and chat redacted blow an arm wrestling

1577
02:46:15,959 --> 02:46:17,959
We would share secrets now and again

1578
02:46:18,600 --> 02:46:22,200
Dreadful and chat interview you sure what do you ask me something?

1579
02:46:25,270 --> 02:46:29,670
I'm not telling you the terrible secrets because they are terrible. Who are you?

1580
02:46:30,389 --> 02:46:38,559
My name is jeremy elbertson. Why eat ass?

1581
02:46:40,239 --> 02:46:41,540
redacted

1582
02:46:41,540 --> 02:46:57,270
Excellent interrogation chum so great that you deserve another hugging experience. Why do you why are you pretending to like this game?

1583
02:46:59,969 --> 02:47:03,809
This must not go on the record elizabeth mega think discovered something on the island

1584
02:47:04,370 --> 02:47:06,370
You're not using the chart correctly

1585
02:47:12,420 --> 02:47:18,020
This is important stuff hold on extreme caution I can tell you what to find it but the rest is up to you

1586
02:47:18,899 --> 02:47:22,180
There it is

1587
02:47:22,180 --> 02:47:24,069
There it is

1588
02:47:24,069 --> 02:47:28,969
Um, you guys are doing you're reading the german 985 streaming chart incorrectly

1589
02:47:31,510 --> 02:47:33,510
If I stream a video game

1590
02:47:33,750 --> 02:47:35,540
more than once

1591
02:47:35,620 --> 02:47:42,639
That means that I like it if you see a video game that is streamed more than one time

1592
02:47:43,040 --> 02:47:48,709
That means I found it to be worth doing again

1593
02:47:49,590 --> 02:47:50,549
saw

1594
02:47:50,549 --> 02:47:52,549
Well, here's the thing about saw

1595
02:47:52,629 --> 02:47:57,190
I was I was like self bullied into playing saw again and beating it because

02:47:58,309 --> 02:48:01,909
Um, I got saw two. I I already like bought it. I like heard already ordered it

So I just I had to

1599
02:48:12,370 --> 02:48:16,290
And I didn't notice how I didn't do any more of saw two

1600
02:48:18,129 --> 02:48:19,649
I did saw one

1601
02:48:19,649 --> 02:48:25,170
All right. Let's finish saw one because saw two here comes halloween never playing this fucking game ever again

1602
02:48:28,440 --> 02:48:32,200
All right, let's uh, I want to no donations for a little while. I want to feed

All right. There you go. I did it. No matter what size there's always room for more in my family

1609
02:49:16,399 --> 02:49:18,399
He's huge. He needs his own pen

1610
02:49:20,600 --> 02:49:25,489
He needs his own pen

1611
02:49:25,489 --> 02:49:43,799
Plus two link. What's the context of this? I remember doing this, but I don't remember what the context was

1612
02:49:48,549 --> 02:49:50,389
Why is the hat the same?

1613
02:49:50,389 --> 02:49:57,430
It's like the same person

1614
02:49:58,340 --> 02:50:00,819
This is that's creepy. I don't like that picture

1615
02:50:08,360 --> 02:50:09,559

02:50:09,559 --> 02:50:16,399
That's not the wrong link. Okay, let's go. I gotta pee really bad

1617
02:50:17,120 --> 02:50:21,079
Does it ramble later?

02:50:21,079 --> 02:50:23,079
Wait, are we breeding?

1619
02:50:23,159 --> 02:50:24,520
insect food

1620
02:50:24,520 --> 02:50:27,760
I'll bear it back. I'm gonna sleep in your bed for a minute

1621
02:50:28,399 --> 02:50:48,680
Am I leaving?

1622
02:50:48,680 --> 02:50:50,840
No, no, you open up the pen. They're all running away

1623
02:50:52,799 --> 02:50:56,389
What'd you do?

1624
02:50:57,989 --> 02:51:01,670
Like that hat man, it's fucking me up. It's the same hat the same person

1625
02:51:04,000 --> 02:51:08,760
And they're gone without so much as saying goodbye bug snacks will be simple

1626
02:51:09,479 --> 02:51:11,479
They don't have it in them to be cruel

1627
02:51:11,879 --> 02:51:16,530
But cruelest thing you can do is not care at all

1628
02:51:17,250 --> 02:51:20,420
Oh, maybe I should pay wiggle a visit

1629
02:51:21,700 --> 02:51:24,659
We have to go wrangle all these back again. I hope not

1630
02:51:25,379 --> 02:51:29,889
This is are they terrorizing the town? All right, let me go. I gotta go pee

1631
02:51:30,530 --> 02:51:32,290
Let me take a quick break. I'll be right back

1632
02:51:32,290 --> 02:55:46,799
I think it would be kind of funny

1633
02:55:46,799 --> 02:55:55,729
If I were to come back from the break here and unpause the game and the whole place is just being attacked and on fire and shit

1634
02:56:03,329 --> 02:56:12,309
All right. Um, is he just locking himself in his house? We don't get it. Oh, we don't need to find

1635
02:56:12,790 --> 02:56:15,350
Does he not care anymore?

1636
02:56:15,350 --> 02:56:17,969
All the animals escaped

1637
02:56:18,610 --> 02:56:20,920
weren't we in the middle of

1638
02:56:21,799 --> 02:56:29,590
What's wrong with you? What happened to your teeth? Oh, right foil

1639
02:56:30,790 --> 02:56:33,670
Uh, okay. Let's continue what I was doing. I shouldn't even

1640
02:56:34,620 --> 02:56:36,840
donation campaign

1641
02:56:36,840 --> 02:56:39,239
Oh, but I don't the I can't the

1642
02:56:40,239 --> 02:56:42,719
This is open. I'm not gonna donate them. I'd rather eat them

1643
02:56:45,590 --> 02:56:47,590
If I look they're gonna run away

1644
02:56:55,010 --> 02:56:58,479
Should I he song or riot?

1645
02:56:59,600 --> 02:57:03,989
There's no peace on

1646
02:57:03,989 --> 02:57:05,430
What's up, bro?

1647
02:57:05,430 --> 02:57:13,170
How's it going?

1648
02:57:13,170 --> 02:57:21,780
Okay, I have let me see the map near the mountain peak hang left from the trail and take a narrow ledge north

1649
02:57:22,659 --> 02:57:27,739
It's the attached map the pressure plates won't activate. I think the ancient grumpuses

1650
02:57:28,139 --> 02:57:30,860
Need to be fed first, but what do they like to eat?

1651
02:57:31,500 --> 02:57:39,639
Okay near the mountain peak hang left from the trail and take a narrow ledge north

1652
02:57:40,860 --> 02:57:46,659
See you later

1653
02:57:46,659 --> 02:57:55,959
Riot riot riot riot riot riot. That's fine. You can ride all you want. You're not getting up. You are not getting a

1654
02:57:56,840 --> 02:58:02,920
When we use the toilet we no we're not doing that. I am not doing that. That's why I'm drawing the line there for real

1655
02:58:03,639 --> 02:58:19,299
I'm not getting any more than that

1656
02:58:19,620 --> 02:58:22,309
songs

1657
02:58:23,270 --> 02:58:28,549
There's like a company that just makes a variation of the same song with 3d animated characters

1658
02:58:28,870 --> 02:58:34,090
It's like baby eats vegetables and it's like peas peas

1659
02:58:34,649 --> 02:58:36,649
Baby eats the peas

1660
02:58:36,649 --> 02:58:37,850
Yum. Yum. Yum

1661
02:58:37,850 --> 02:58:44,739
I eat them up the peas and they replace words and they just kind of change a little bit of the animation and they have

1662
02:58:44,819 --> 02:58:50,709
a billion views each

1663
02:58:50,950 --> 02:58:52,950
Johnny dude, dude, dude

1664
02:58:53,829 --> 02:58:56,840
Johnny

1665
02:58:56,840 --> 02:59:04,120
I was real. Okay. I gotta be honest with you during the johnny dude to do arc of like meme ability from like a year or

1666
02:59:04,120 --> 02:59:12,120
Two ago. I sat there. I watched dozens and dozens and dozens of like weird children's song videos and they made me laugh

1667
02:59:16,469 --> 02:59:22,149
During like the johnny dude to do joke that everybody thought was so funny. I was like, you know, what what else is out there?

1668
02:59:30,260 --> 02:59:33,860
I I think some of you guys underestimate just the kind of shit that I do

1669
02:59:35,110 --> 02:59:39,270
Last night. I watched a compilation of wood cutting videos

1670
02:59:41,000 --> 02:59:44,040
Just people splitting wood and just cutting wood

1671
02:59:45,559 --> 02:59:47,559
It's like real

1672
02:59:47,959 --> 02:59:57,719
I'm like, yeah, that's nice. I don't know. Just gonna fell like it. Okay, here we go the ledge on north. Here it is

1673
03:00:03,799 --> 03:00:06,680
Found it. All right, the gods like to eat food

1674
03:00:09,100 --> 03:00:17,270
I haven't figured out anything. Oh my grump. Is it to find this? I know what you mean yesterday. I played

1675
03:00:17,350 --> 03:00:19,350
I watched some guy play bug snacks

1676
03:00:19,979 --> 03:00:26,170
It's not

1677
03:00:26,170 --> 03:00:28,889
Says i'll need to activate these statues

1678
03:00:30,020 --> 03:00:32,020
Feeding them the snack they represent

1679
03:00:32,899 --> 03:00:34,340
Thanks for the help

1680
03:00:34,340 --> 03:00:37,030
I'll take it from here

1681
03:00:37,030 --> 03:00:39,430
Okay

You know why I wish I could just say yes, please do that. I don't care do it you catch half

1683
03:00:44,950 --> 03:00:48,309
I'll catch the other half and we'll meet back here. So good

1684
03:00:50,969 --> 03:00:54,409
Activate three bug statues. All right, what do you represent?

1685
03:00:54,969 --> 03:00:57,239
What did I feed you?

1686
03:00:57,239 --> 03:00:58,840
I didn't even click anything

1687
03:00:58,920 --> 03:01:01,350
Oh, okay you

1688
03:01:02,209 --> 03:01:05,850

Hamburger stuff. I don't know

1695
03:01:21,049 --> 03:01:27,510
You're ignoring a raid. Is it what raid came in? Oh master gear

1696
03:01:31,049 --> 03:01:37,290
Sing the raid song. I don't even remember what the raid song is

1697
03:01:38,229 --> 03:01:39,350

1705
03:01:58,629 --> 03:02:03,270
I don't know what to feed these fucking people. You want ice cream sandwiches. You want hamburgers. You want cookies

1706
03:02:03,909 --> 03:02:12,979
I don't have any of these

1707
03:02:13,059 --> 03:02:15,510
you want

1708
03:02:15,510 --> 03:02:17,799
bread

1709
03:02:17,799 --> 03:02:22,920
Ice cream. I think I have ice cream. How do I not have any of the things anybody wants? This is definitely you're a cookie

1710
03:02:28,360 --> 03:02:31,059

Do I think I have a soty? Oh, I do I have a soty

1717
03:02:51,770 --> 03:02:53,770
But this is a mount soty though

1718
03:02:56,329 --> 03:02:59,590
All right

1719
03:02:59,590 --> 03:03:00,870

Somebody remember those we need ice cream. We need a scoopie. We need a chippy. We need a jammy

We need a soty

1723
03:03:12,040 --> 03:03:18,020
And we need a stewie that kind of looks like stewie. It looks like stew. I'd say right

1724
03:03:18,500 --> 03:03:27,530
Okay, let's go

1725
03:03:27,530 --> 03:03:29,770
You only need three. Yes. So whatever I find first

1726
03:03:30,409 --> 03:03:43,659
Worst joke 2020. You can't just say everything is the worst joke 2020. Wait, that's a scoopie. No, that's a scoopie banana pee

1727
03:03:44,680 --> 03:03:46,040
Not the same thing

1728
03:03:46,040 --> 03:03:48,040
Don't wait. Here's a mountain dew

1729
03:03:48,680 --> 03:03:50,360
Mountain dew I got you

It hates all sauce, right?

1732
03:03:56,120 --> 03:03:58,120
You're gonna hate that aren't you?

1733
03:04:00,180 --> 03:04:02,620
Wait, cover the sauce

1734
03:04:02,620 --> 03:04:05,430
Cover the ball in sauce and get it

1735
03:04:08,840 --> 03:04:10,520
What a moron

1736
03:04:10,520 --> 03:04:14,180
Moron. Oops. I forgot. I forgot I had to catch you

1737
03:04:15,059 --> 03:04:28,100
There's one

1738
03:04:28,100 --> 03:04:34,389
All right. Now I need a scoopie a regular scoopie. Not any weird scoopie worst game 2020

1739
03:04:34,469 --> 03:04:37,270

03:04:46,340 --> 03:04:48,340

You need a poopie too

1749
03:05:17,879 --> 03:05:21,909
No such thing as a poopie. All right. There's the chippy. That's his route

1750
03:05:22,549 --> 03:05:35,430
He's coming right at me. Wait, hold on. He's coming. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait, okay

Come on. Okay, let's bring you to the cold

1756
03:06:04,420 --> 03:06:15,780
Is it weird that i'm jealous that I didn't get to do every single voice in this game?

1757
03:06:25,239 --> 03:06:29,319
Yeah, if I could go back in time and do every single character in this game, I would want to

1758
03:06:29,879 --> 03:06:32,360
No, not the ones that talk though. No, fuck that. That's I don't do that

1759
03:06:33,079 --> 03:06:38,940
I'm talking about the weird animal bugs foods. That's what I want. I don't want to be the people talking

1760
03:06:38,940 --> 03:06:45,579
I want to be these things

1761
03:06:45,579 --> 03:06:47,340
All right. Where's the uh?

1762
03:06:47,340 --> 03:06:49,180

There we go. There's a bobsicle

03:07:10,340 --> 03:07:12,340
Come on and put like a little filter on that

1768
03:07:12,659 --> 03:07:19,049

That's better

1776
03:07:50,200 --> 03:07:54,500
That was mortal combat. That wasn't worse. How is that worse?

1777
03:07:55,930 --> 03:07:57,930
Fine, i'll do one more. You can use what anyone you want

03:08:35,700 --> 03:08:42,229
Well, I know how to get him in the water. What am I doing?

1788
03:08:59,319 --> 03:09:16,219

I say you got it

1790
03:09:28,149 --> 03:09:34,090
You're a sellout. Wait, did you not hear what I said? Just use it for free. I don't

1791
03:09:35,129 --> 03:09:36,889
That's how is that a sellout?

1792
03:09:36,889 --> 03:09:42,459
All right, where's studler? All right studler

1793

1795
03:09:49,209 --> 03:09:51,940
delicious

1796
03:09:51,940 --> 03:09:53,700
this is a

1797
03:09:53,700 --> 03:09:58,090
Get mount sodie

1798
03:09:58,090 --> 03:10:00,090
This one was a

1799
03:10:00,090 --> 03:10:02,090
I don't have a chili nilly

1800
03:10:03,110 --> 03:10:04,469
it's

1801
03:10:04,469 --> 03:10:07,860
A chippy right here. That's it

1802
03:10:10,229 --> 03:10:11,819
You're okay

1803
03:10:11,819 --> 03:10:16,540
You are okay, right blood has been spilled drowsiness numbness or missing limbs

1804
03:10:17,639 --> 03:10:19,479
Sorry

1805
03:10:19,479 --> 03:10:22,819
Uh, don't mind me. I got the rest of the snacks

1806
03:10:24,979 --> 03:10:28,180
Oh, you got the other ones. Okay, that helps next she says

1807
03:10:30,860 --> 03:10:36,299
She says we need three grumpuses to do the final. No, we don't know any other grumpuses. It's just us

1808
03:10:36,780 --> 03:10:40,860
Mountain is unstable. I don't like there's like 10 people back at home. We could pay

1809
03:10:42,139 --> 03:10:46,379
Two strawberries to come up here. I can't let anybody else get hurt for my sake

1810
03:10:47,100 --> 03:10:49,340
I feel bad enough involving you

1811
03:10:50,139 --> 03:10:54,809
Oh, what would lizbert do?

1812
03:10:56,120 --> 03:10:57,940
Ask philbo

1813
03:10:57,940 --> 03:11:00,579
Liz trust philbo for some reason all right philbo

1814
03:11:00,819 --> 03:11:04,659
We're gonna bring phil we're gonna sacrifice philbo watch your step on the way back down, okay

1815
03:11:05,379 --> 03:11:18,149
You know, we can't we just put a big rock up here. I don't understand. There's only three plates

1816
03:11:19,030 --> 03:11:24,149
You're telling me you can't just pick up this snowman and like put them over there

1817
03:11:25,340 --> 03:11:26,700
Why?

1818
03:11:26,700 --> 03:11:30,540
Just build a take a bunch of these rocks and put them over there. We need three people

1819
03:11:31,420 --> 03:11:35,799
This makes no sense. It's completely unrealistic and this game is just

1820
03:11:36,440 --> 03:11:38,520
Really needs to dial back some of the cartoon bullshit

1821
03:11:40,819 --> 03:11:48,920
More realism brew brew

1822
03:11:52,489 --> 03:12:00,639
That's one of my fish. Okay, my fish is fine. Let's go talk to philbo

1823
03:12:01,260 --> 03:12:12,299
You're asking for realism in a game where you eat bugs

1824
03:12:12,860 --> 03:12:34,200
See you in a hundred years where that's the number one source of protein for humans. They're saying I will not eat the bugs

1825
03:12:36,700 --> 03:12:39,180
You won't even you won't even really think about it. Will you it'll be

1826
03:12:39,899 --> 03:12:41,420
It'll be ground up

1827
03:12:41,420 --> 03:12:48,260
Turned into a patty at a bunch of sauces and flavorings added to it. You won't even you won't even care

1828
03:12:53,590 --> 03:12:55,350
All right, philbo

1829
03:12:55,350 --> 03:12:59,899
I need you

1830
03:12:59,899 --> 03:13:02,459
I know where lizbert is

1831
03:13:09,719 --> 03:13:18,889
Let's go bugs are literally land seafood bugs are literally land seafood

1832
03:13:20,010 --> 03:13:22,010
I don't understand

1833
03:13:35,540 --> 03:13:37,540
Beyond bugs, yeah

1834
03:13:38,500 --> 03:13:41,860
We'll eat too many bugs and then we'll have to make fake bug meat

1835
03:13:42,500 --> 03:13:48,739
So 200 years from now people will be so shocked at how much like the real thing beyond bug tastes like

1836
03:14:03,129 --> 03:14:05,129
I can't believe it's not bugs

1837
03:14:07,610 --> 03:14:12,809
This is not I don't this is not like my typical bug spread I can tell the difference

1838
03:14:14,620 --> 03:14:16,620
Get the fuck up grandpa get with the times

1839
03:14:19,100 --> 03:14:22,059
Yeah, you really came out of your shell, huh?

1840
03:14:24,040 --> 03:14:30,600
Hey, um, so why do you want my help? I thought you would have asked chandlo chandlo's got snorpy to worry about

1841
03:14:31,479 --> 03:14:33,430
besides

1842
03:14:33,430 --> 03:14:35,030
around for years

1843
03:14:35,030 --> 03:14:36,950
I can't sprint

1844
03:14:36,950 --> 03:14:39,030
I can't sprint

1845
03:14:39,030 --> 03:14:41,850
I can't sprint

1846
03:14:43,450 --> 03:15:03,399
Why can I still hear them fuck they're waiting for me. I want to get in front of them quick

1847
03:15:04,280 --> 03:15:07,879
Let me get in front of them by at least a large enough margin where I can launch one of them off the cliff

1848
03:15:07,879 --> 03:15:10,920
I've wanted to do it for like the last two hours. Let me get in front of them and go a little bit faster, please

1849
03:15:11,979 --> 03:15:13,979
please

1850
03:15:14,620 --> 03:15:21,750
Oh

1851
03:15:21,750 --> 03:15:25,430
Liz thought it might be some kind of ancient temple to bug snacks

1852
03:15:25,989 --> 03:15:33,590
Wait a minute if this door takes three of us to open. How would lizbert get inside by herself?

1853
03:15:34,149 --> 03:15:37,190
What makes you think she's behind it? She didn't because she has to be

1854
03:15:37,989 --> 03:15:42,389
I looked everywhere her friends came in with her and they had to make a choice

1855
03:15:45,000 --> 03:15:46,600
You figure it out

1856
03:15:46,600 --> 03:15:49,159
Lizbert still there still alive

1857
03:15:50,620 --> 03:15:53,260
With a bunch of red stains around her mouth

1858
03:15:54,540 --> 03:16:00,100
You figure it out. This is it

1859
03:16:00,889 --> 03:16:02,180
ready

1860
03:16:02,180 --> 03:16:04,739
one two

1861
03:16:04,739 --> 03:16:05,860
three

1862
03:16:05,860 --> 03:16:21,270
Holy shit, that almost crushed his head. That was close. You killed us all. Hey. Hey, it's okay

1863
03:16:21,350 --> 03:16:28,329
Agabelle that was kind of scary, but we're fine. We'll just try it again and no i'll try it again

1864
03:16:28,809 --> 03:16:34,010
You two are going home. What agabelle? I want to find lizbert just as badly as you do

1865
03:16:34,569 --> 03:16:36,569
You don't have to do this alone

1866
03:16:36,969 --> 03:16:38,569
Yes, I do

1867
03:16:38,569 --> 03:16:40,729
I'm a burden to everybody around me

1868
03:16:41,370 --> 03:16:43,370
That's why she's gone

1869
03:16:44,010 --> 03:16:45,450
What do you mean?

1870
03:16:45,450 --> 03:16:50,250
I was being stupid and I slipped up on the cliffs while I was trying to show off

1871
03:16:51,209 --> 03:16:55,049
The earthquake hit and and I was gonna fall but liz saved me

1872
03:16:55,690 --> 03:16:57,610
Like she always does

1873
03:16:57,610 --> 03:17:01,610
She got swept away and then the ground opened beneath her and

1874
03:17:04,420 --> 03:17:09,059
I'm so sorry. It would have been really great for you to tell me this like six hours ago. Please do it

1875
03:17:09,540 --> 03:17:11,700
Please just go

1876
03:17:11,700 --> 03:17:13,700
I can't stand to see anyone else hurt

1877
03:17:14,979 --> 03:17:16,020
You know

1878
03:17:16,020 --> 03:17:20,899
When I was looking for lizbert instead of finding little clues and hints on little map markings

1879
03:17:21,379 --> 03:17:24,420
So I tried eating this purple flower. She died in an earthquake

1880
03:17:25,299 --> 03:17:27,299
And then I went

1881
03:17:28,100 --> 03:17:30,100
What the fuck I fell in a hole

1882
03:17:30,340 --> 03:17:35,139
And and by the time I dragged myself out of there, I was so tired and hungry. I could barely move

1883
03:17:36,379 --> 03:17:38,379
That's when we met buddy

1884
03:17:39,420 --> 03:17:41,420
That's awful

1885
03:17:41,420 --> 03:17:42,940
it was

1886
03:17:42,940 --> 03:17:43,979
because

1887
03:17:43,979 --> 03:17:45,340
you know

1888
03:17:45,340 --> 03:17:51,260
I can't make it on my own like you and lizbert and it's times like those when I could really use a doctor

1889
03:17:52,940 --> 03:17:56,309
All right, I get it

1890
03:17:56,790 --> 03:17:58,790
I need some time to think

1891
03:17:59,260 --> 03:18:03,899
I still want to figure out what I got wrong. I have a jacket by the way. I do

1892
03:18:04,379 --> 03:18:06,219
We've been out here for a long time

1893
03:18:06,219 --> 03:18:09,020
And then we'll find liz together

1894
03:18:09,579 --> 03:18:11,510
Thank you. Philbo

1895
03:18:11,510 --> 03:18:17,450
Stay safe

1896
03:18:17,450 --> 03:18:18,969
Oh my god

1897
03:18:18,969 --> 03:18:20,969
No, no, no, no, no. Wait, wait, wait, wait

1898
03:18:32,469 --> 03:18:36,149
I killed him. I killed him. I killed that fucking guy. I killed him. I got him

1899
03:18:38,139 --> 03:18:43,899
I got him

1900
03:18:43,899 --> 03:18:47,459
I killed the mayor. That means i'm the mayor now

1901
03:18:51,139 --> 03:18:59,190
He thought it was fun

1902
03:18:59,190 --> 03:19:05,610
Oh shit

1903
03:19:05,610 --> 03:19:21,159
He's gonna die down there

1904
03:19:21,159 --> 03:19:52,149
Quick remove the evidence. You're right destroy. You should have taken a picture of him. All right. So now what a big story

1905
03:19:52,229 --> 03:19:56,920
Oh, I need to all right. I'm missing two interviews. I gotta get cheese for this lady

1906
03:19:57,000 --> 03:20:21,219
All right, let's go get cheese for this lady. Sometimes I dream about cheese

1907
03:20:24,260 --> 03:20:38,389
Me too. This coffee is garbage. You gotta you gotta get better coffee then man grind your own beans

1908
03:20:39,420 --> 03:20:53,940
And like percolate the coffee for like four hours. That's worth it. He's back

1909
03:20:58,309 --> 03:21:17,219
All right cheese for the cheese lady now really good coffee is awesome. I agree problem with really good coffee is

1910
03:21:17,700 --> 03:21:19,700
It really just it's kind of a pain in the ass

1911
03:21:20,569 --> 03:21:26,889
I don't the grinding beans right from the bean factory whatever and then grinding them up getting the hot pour over it

1912
03:21:28,729 --> 03:21:32,250
I don't I just want the caffeine and like it's nice to have some

1913
03:21:32,809 --> 03:21:37,209
If you go to a restaurant friend like a nice cappuccino at a restaurant or espresso from like a nice coffee place

1914
03:21:37,370 --> 03:21:39,129
I love it. I do

1915
03:21:39,129 --> 03:21:43,930
But I don't do that shit at my house. All right. Where is the where is she?

1916
03:21:50,069 --> 03:21:52,389
Well, if you can make your own cold brew, that's good, too. It's easy

1917
03:21:57,639 --> 03:22:01,079
Get the pre ground good shit. Yeah, you can put it in the car. That's fine putting in a cup

1918
03:22:01,079 --> 03:22:06,680
But i'm talking about the people that really want to you get the beans out you grind them and you do the slow

1919
03:22:07,159 --> 03:22:09,159
pour over type stuff

1920
03:22:09,540 --> 03:22:12,739
That's too much for me. Just like just I want to open my mouth and just fucking drink it

1921
03:22:14,659 --> 03:22:16,260
All right, where's the cheese lady?

1922
03:22:16,260 --> 03:22:26,899
I thought that if this was the cheese I was gonna be so mad. All right. Where's this cheese?

1923
03:22:30,809 --> 03:22:35,610
Do you want a cheeser?

03:27:31,350 --> 03:27:35,350
One still lost in darkness seeking the light

1960
03:27:36,069 --> 03:27:40,549
For only in the light of mother natural ray can oh I broke

1961
03:27:41,350 --> 03:27:43,350

Seek a raspy

1963
03:27:46,069 --> 03:27:48,629
Deep below please germ. I worked hard on this

1964
03:27:51,379 --> 03:28:02,440
I I wonder if you did how did you do this? This is very fast. This is not even 10 minutes ago

1965
03:28:02,920 --> 03:28:23,540
That was like five minutes ago. It's pretty good for five minutes

1966
03:28:24,360 --> 03:28:26,780
It's great for five minutes

1967
03:28:26,780 --> 03:28:32,899
The detail on the clouds back there that alone would have taken me 10 minutes. It's another one. All right

1968
03:28:32,899 --> 03:28:38,649
What is it?

1969
03:28:38,649 --> 03:28:46,569
You guys in the make the person fat filter and make the person old filter you guys love these so much

03:28:48,840 --> 03:29:19,110
You can't get enough of them. I look like a bird the dark souls character

1971
03:29:20,600 --> 03:29:23,000

Seek it well

1978
03:29:49,860 --> 03:30:04,549
Every dark souls character for some reason they just have a wheeze laugh at the end of every sentence fashion one

03:30:04,549 --> 03:30:09,079
I'll guide this raspy to one's side

1980
03:30:12,120 --> 03:30:17,719
All right guide a black raspy from the under ruins. Oh, I know where that is

1981
03:30:20,649 --> 03:30:24,809
We found that earlier. This would have been really really hard if I didn't accidentally find this

1982
03:30:28,299 --> 03:30:31,399
Fill up on chocolate

1983
03:30:31,399 --> 03:30:36,280
He's over here. There you are. Don't you love chocolate? You love chocolate. You love it

1984
03:30:38,180 --> 03:30:40,579
But it's going to be kind of annoying because you're here

1985
03:30:41,379 --> 03:30:46,819
You're annoying and nobody wants to oh that looks good. It looks pretty delicious. I'm not gonna lie

I don't want i'm gonna get in trouble

2004

The time has come egress from the sand scape so it is that shelter survives

I don't know what you meant was a metaphor go back to town so I can interview you

2006
03:33:30,229 --> 03:33:33,370
To bring such clarity to my followers

03:33:46,629 --> 03:33:56,780
Fuck whatever. Okay, you have been delivered

now

2010
03:34:02,340 --> 03:34:04,340
There's only one thing left to do

2038
03:37:12,780 --> 03:37:17,100
A lot of world of warcraft references the last a couple of days and i'm really sorry about that

2039
03:37:19,120 --> 03:37:20,319
I'm sorry

2040
03:37:20,319 --> 03:37:22,319
I just I don't know what it is today

2041
03:37:23,360 --> 03:37:26,719
I don't play it. I haven't played it in years. I don't care about it strange about her arm

2042
03:37:27,610 --> 03:37:30,909
She was keeping it hidden, but she displayed early stages of snackification

2043
03:37:31,850 --> 03:37:38,409
That peaked to my interest what about shadowland? No interest in it at all. You are asking for opinions instead of facts

2044
03:37:38,809 --> 03:37:40,889
I'm not going to discuss my feelings with you

2045
03:37:41,510 --> 03:37:44,440
emotional parasite

2046
03:37:44,440 --> 03:37:50,840
Hey, that was not nice. I tried to publish my groundbreaking research you journalists instead churn out slander about my

2047
03:37:51,540 --> 03:37:52,680
dangerous

2048
03:37:52,680 --> 03:37:59,290
That's really into the links today. Huh? You really are i'm i'm into it

2049
03:38:00,909 --> 03:38:05,840
What the fuck is this?

2050
03:38:05,840 --> 03:38:07,840
What is this is weird?

2051
03:38:07,920 --> 03:38:28,280
What how did you do that? You morphed me and taylor swift?

2052
03:38:30,489 --> 03:38:32,489
Is that what you did? Somebody said that's what you did

2053
03:38:33,129 --> 03:38:40,239
Is it like a british kid?

2054
03:38:42,239 --> 03:38:46,590
Why british?

2055
03:38:47,639 --> 03:38:53,000
British kid stop editorializing and focus on the science the kid on the corner with a newspaper

2056
03:38:53,559 --> 03:38:57,959
All right. Looks like we've got some news today for you a quarter penny, please

2057
03:39:02,750 --> 03:39:06,110
That kind of british kid. I simply wanted to continue my work

2058
03:39:06,350 --> 03:39:11,840
Agabelle or no, but sheldon blamed me for the disappearances no stranger to witch hunts

2059
03:39:12,079 --> 03:39:14,559
I vacated before the pitchforks could come out

2060
03:39:17,520 --> 03:39:23,180
cockney orphan

2061
03:39:23,180 --> 03:39:29,819
There is no in-between on tv and media you're either cockney orphan or your five thousand dollar dress

2062
03:39:30,520 --> 03:39:33,680
Champagne sipping socialite. There's no in-between

2063
03:39:49,100 --> 03:39:54,719
Why are you saying that with a voice changer what i keep my suffered leg in the outhouse austin powers

2064
03:39:56,620 --> 03:39:58,780
the truth

2065
03:39:58,780 --> 03:40:07,979
Elizabeth was an arrogant coward unlike agabelle agabelle truly understood my research. She was hungry to participate in it

2066
03:40:08,459 --> 03:40:13,000
Our work together was fruitful even pleasant until somebody interfered

2067
03:40:13,799 --> 03:40:16,719
What's wrong with this person?

2068
03:40:16,719 --> 03:40:22,399
That mummified fraud stoked elizabeth's fear of my work weaponizing her relationship to agabelle

2069
03:40:23,020 --> 03:40:28,000
Scrambling her fragile emotions and fabricating a binary choice between myself and elizabeth

2070
03:40:28,799 --> 03:40:33,530
So what happened ultimately agabelle chose sentiment over science?

2071
03:40:34,250 --> 03:40:39,680
And I surmise that was the death of her death death kill kill you killed her you killed isabelle. Yes

2072
03:40:40,399 --> 03:40:46,639
I have the password to agabelle's personal storage box or it may be of interest to you personal storage box enough of mine

2073
03:40:46,639 --> 03:40:54,940
We already opened this leave. I already opened that with another key. This is old news

2074
03:40:57,370 --> 03:40:59,370
All right. Let's go to isabelle's house

2075
03:41:00,159 --> 03:41:02,000

2118
03:45:19,100 --> 03:45:25,329
Am I a hater? I'm not a hater. I'm just saying like it's we've gotten every like 80s movie action and horror movie star

2119
03:45:27,299 --> 03:45:36,129
What's left freddy krueger?

2120
03:45:36,129 --> 03:45:38,129
Michael meyers

2121
03:45:38,450 --> 03:45:41,250
He's in it. No, he's not who's in the other one

2122
03:45:42,829 --> 03:45:44,829
He was he was that's right

2123
03:45:49,309 --> 03:45:51,250
I don't know like

2124
03:45:51,250 --> 03:45:53,840
doc from

2125
03:45:53,840 --> 03:45:56,959
I almost said whose lines it anyways doc from back to the future

2126
03:45:57,120 --> 03:46:00,719
I'm sure it'll be like great scott and he'll have like devices he can use. I'm sure they'll do it

2127
03:46:13,700 --> 03:46:16,120
Doc getting brutalized by the terminator

2128
03:46:20,020 --> 03:46:25,540
But I don't know don't put a pass they'll put the care bears in mortal combat 11 at this point

2129
03:46:32,819 --> 03:46:39,299
They added the ninja turtles to smite we're starting to get a little weird here

2130
03:46:54,879 --> 03:46:56,879
They're in injustice, too

2131
03:46:57,040 --> 03:47:00,879
Yeah, why what's with the ninja turtles showing up in other like fighting games

2132
03:47:05,870 --> 03:47:10,510
Why is it the ninja turtles it's always the ninja turtles it's like oh man here we go big reveal

2133
03:47:10,590 --> 03:47:15,629
We're adding the ninja turtles to our fighting game or our game like it's like at this point

2134
03:47:15,870 --> 03:47:27,229
It's been like three or four times now one game

2135
03:47:28,430 --> 03:47:31,180
That's not true

2136
03:47:48,780 --> 03:47:55,100
Oh, i'm thinking of the hold on i'm mixing my amphibious creatures i'm thinking of the battle toads as well

2137
03:47:57,889 --> 03:48:00,930
Because they've they've put the battle toads in a few things, right?

2138
03:48:02,530 --> 03:48:06,530
The battle toads and the ninja turtles are essentially they're pretty they're very close

2139
03:48:09,100 --> 03:48:17,760
I would say the battle toads are just radical ninja turtles, but ninja turtles are radical battle toads. This is tricky

2140
03:48:33,069 --> 03:48:35,069
Take that back

2141
03:48:35,389 --> 03:48:37,389
They're in killer instinct and shovel knight

2142
03:48:46,000 --> 03:48:48,000
I love the battle toads

2143
03:48:48,239 --> 03:48:51,040
I don't think they got done pretty I don't think they were done justice though

2144
03:48:51,680 --> 03:48:59,709
May answers be found. It's mystery. This is a locked box. I have oh

2145
03:49:00,270 --> 03:49:02,270
I think I I think I beat the game

2146
03:49:06,399 --> 03:49:09,489
They just had a new game

2147
03:49:09,489 --> 03:49:14,209
But was it I mean, but didn't it wasn't like it was like a wasn't it like kind of tacked on to like game

2148
03:49:14,290 --> 03:49:16,290
Pass or something. It wasn't like big deal. Was it?

2149
03:49:18,049 --> 03:49:20,129
They also did the same shit with the ninja turtles, too

2150
03:49:20,209 --> 03:49:28,639
Remember that and when they remade the like they did a new ninja turtles beat them up game and it was like

2151
03:49:28,639 --> 03:49:46,079
This is kind of not good. You're stalling. I'm not what like the game. What the fuck?

2152
03:49:47,040 --> 03:49:48,639
I can't what?

2153
03:49:48,639 --> 03:49:50,079
Where like that?

2154
03:49:50,079 --> 03:49:58,780
Hey

2155
03:49:58,780 --> 03:50:04,500
Is the final videotape today?

2156
03:50:06,420 --> 03:50:07,860
today

2157
03:50:07,860 --> 03:51:12,530
bro, bro

2158
03:51:16,350 --> 03:51:23,920
Somebody just wrote it all caps be fucking funny. I'm watching like a cut scene, dude

2159
03:51:24,930 --> 03:51:30,940
What do you want me to do right now?

2160
03:51:30,940 --> 03:51:32,940
I'm watching the cut scene

2161
03:51:33,409 --> 03:51:40,639
What? All right, so we've completed. I don't even know what that was supposed to tell filbo

2162
03:51:42,079 --> 03:51:48,239
How's it? Hey channel art chandler. Yeah, dog. What do you want? I'm trying to pull up this stuff

2163
03:51:48,479 --> 03:51:54,979
I can build a b-bar court. I'm about as swole as a grumpus can get and I can't move this thing at all

2164
03:51:55,540 --> 03:51:57,840
I gotta be stronger than a grumpus

2165
03:51:58,559 --> 03:52:00,879
I gotta push my limits. You feel me?

2166
03:52:02,500 --> 03:52:03,620
I feel you

2167
03:52:03,620 --> 03:52:08,579
I need your help to do the main story main story main story. The main story is almost over

2168
03:52:08,819 --> 03:52:15,440
Snacks around eat them. We've got all 12 brompuses. We have all the locations

2169
03:52:15,899 --> 03:52:22,750
You go find the biggest buffest bug snacks around

2170
03:52:28,610 --> 03:52:35,389
You won't catch aggressive bug stacks. All right, where's um, where's loopy? There he is. Come on loopy

2171
03:52:36,270 --> 03:52:42,190
Wow, it's getting crowded around we gotta celebrate big time

2172
03:52:42,829 --> 03:52:45,469
This party's gonna change everything buddy

2173
03:52:46,030 --> 03:52:48,030
Are you sure you're ready?

2174
03:52:48,610 --> 03:52:51,889
Once you start the party, you won't be able to catch bug snacks or complete quests

2175
03:52:51,969 --> 03:52:59,809
Be sure you've done everything you won't wait. This is actually the end of the game. I'm not ready. This is actually the finale

2176
03:53:00,209 --> 03:53:06,059
What's going on wiggle? All right. I'm not ready. I'm not ready. I'm not right. I don't want to do your quest your quest is dumb

2177
03:53:07,649 --> 03:53:14,639
What do you have? Not too bad. Actually would you mind helping me finish this? I'm not ready. I'm not ready

2178
03:53:16,299 --> 03:53:18,399
I just want to see

2179
03:53:18,399 --> 03:53:20,399
end this game, please this game

2180
03:53:20,879 --> 03:53:26,639
This I thought we were in agreement that everybody liked what was going on today and yesterday I like what you don't like this

2181
03:53:32,370 --> 03:53:34,370
I want to go exploring with trippany

2182
03:53:38,850 --> 03:53:49,090
Flavor falls we haven't even explored flavor falls. Let me explore flavor falls first and then we'll do the finale

2183
03:53:49,569 --> 03:53:54,879
I like the game from two days ago

2184
03:53:56,510 --> 03:54:01,309
We haven't even looked around here we have never even been here before look at it's all new

2185
03:54:02,110 --> 03:54:05,709
All new we never even seen this before actually. Yes, we have give me that

2186
03:54:10,020 --> 03:54:12,340
I would love like a bird shit just dropped right in her hat

2187
03:54:15,549 --> 03:54:18,510
Okay, scan a stone grumpus and report to trippany

2188
03:54:19,149 --> 03:54:21,969
Are they gonna catch the sandwich yet?

2189
03:54:25,520 --> 03:54:32,030
and a stone grumpus

2190
03:54:32,030 --> 03:54:35,149
He loves cheese. Okay. Wait, I want I want to catch. Whoa, what the

2191
03:54:37,100 --> 03:54:38,379
That's a pickle

2192
03:54:38,379 --> 03:54:41,649
The jar protects it from capture

2193
03:54:44,459 --> 03:54:49,760
This ranch dressing in this game. How did I not even see this before? I told you we didn't see this

2194
03:54:50,479 --> 03:55:02,930
No, give that back. I got a pickle. I want to get the sandwich too

2195
03:55:03,569 --> 03:55:08,100
All right. We're gonna place a trap for the sandwich

2196
03:55:08,100 --> 03:55:20,860
Where's the sandwich?

2197
03:55:20,860 --> 03:55:27,409
Very important. Very important. Did you know that chandler's names backwards is that's fun? I don't know

2198
03:55:28,129 --> 03:55:31,780
You just said that a person's name backwards

2199
03:55:33,100 --> 03:55:35,860
All right. Come on sando

2200
03:55:35,860 --> 03:55:37,860
Bump it

2201
03:55:41,780 --> 03:55:43,219
I got the whole thing

2202
03:55:43,219 --> 03:55:52,659
What are you staring at this bush for? Okay scan a stone grumpus and report. All right stone grumpus

2203
03:55:54,079 --> 03:55:59,979
Is the one in here?

2204
03:55:59,979 --> 03:56:01,979
Uh, it's a stone grumpus

2205
03:56:02,540 --> 03:56:04,540
These statues must be hundreds of years old

2206
03:56:05,329 --> 03:56:07,329
Very cool. I just scanned with

2207
03:56:07,940 --> 03:56:10,719
What is that?

2208
03:56:10,719 --> 03:56:12,319
an inch wrap

2209
03:56:12,319 --> 03:56:38,420
How do I catch? Oh gross. What's in there? Didn't I scan scan a stone grumpus? That's not what that is

2210
03:56:46,399 --> 03:56:48,399
That's a strawberry idiot

2211
03:56:50,030 --> 03:56:52,030
It needs to be a stone grumpus

2212
03:56:58,590 --> 03:57:05,440
What's in here something's in here?

2213
03:57:05,739 --> 03:57:07,840
California it was in there what?

2214
03:57:10,719 --> 03:57:13,399
California

2215
03:57:13,739 --> 03:57:16,879
California all that

2216
03:57:20,120 --> 03:57:26,909
California that's from total distortion

2217
03:57:27,329 --> 03:57:29,329
California it's one of the facebook

2218
03:57:33,120 --> 03:57:37,360
There would be the work of the ancient stone. When am I gonna stream that? I already did

2219
03:57:37,840 --> 03:57:39,040
from over

2220
03:57:39,040 --> 03:57:40,959
5,000 years ago

2221
03:57:40,959 --> 03:57:47,440
All that's left to them is statuary and some puzzling mechanisms long time ago like the desert grumps

2222
03:57:47,840 --> 03:57:50,000
These folks didn't preserve their dead

2223
03:57:50,719 --> 03:57:55,200
In fact, I think I did the writer thinks they would sacrifice them to the bug snacks

2224
03:57:55,600 --> 03:57:58,159
Like an offering to the gods and whatnot

2225
03:57:58,799 --> 03:58:04,319
This means bug snacks may be a more lasting legacy than any of the stuff they built wait

2226
03:58:04,719 --> 03:58:06,719
Did I I did stream it didn't I?

2227
03:58:09,250 --> 03:58:13,090
I swear to god I did

2228
03:58:13,090 --> 03:58:15,329
Gotta gotta have the big squidward pickle nose, right?

2229
03:58:18,420 --> 03:58:21,780
You might have noticed pinkle statues scattered around here

2230
03:58:22,340 --> 03:58:26,180
These must have been an important food source to the ancient grumps

2231
03:58:27,540 --> 03:58:29,139
Okay, well

2232
03:58:29,139 --> 03:58:35,059
I was hoping to find a camp of some sort maybe a quarter. You just ruined her. Oh, well

2233
03:58:35,540 --> 03:58:40,260
There's plenty more spots to check. I mean ruined her let's head back to snaxford for now

2234
03:58:44,159 --> 03:58:46,159
Catch aggressive meaty bug snacks

2235
03:58:47,360 --> 03:58:51,200
Oh, i've got the sandwich. I've got three sandwiches for him. I just did two quests in a row

2236
03:58:51,760 --> 03:58:54,000
What's that garlic? It's a garlic enemy

2237
03:58:54,639 --> 03:59:08,620
Edgy poop that's two quests done

2238
03:59:09,260 --> 03:59:22,829
Somebody else wanted the sub too, right? Uh wiggle I get all that

2239
03:59:23,790 --> 03:59:25,790
Hold on. I i'm curious. Let me see

2240
03:59:27,629 --> 03:59:30,379
I'm missing

2241
03:59:33,629 --> 03:59:35,629
I'm still i'm now what is that?

2242
03:59:37,059 --> 03:59:38,659
flavor falls

2243
03:59:38,659 --> 03:59:41,139
I've seen almost everything but not everything everything

2244
03:59:42,559 --> 03:59:44,239
Bag

2245
03:59:44,239 --> 03:59:46,079
Still a couple I haven't seen

2246
03:59:46,079 --> 03:59:49,790
Still a couple of things I haven't seen

2247
03:59:51,739 --> 04:00:01,389
Seen most of it though

2248
04:00:01,389 --> 04:00:03,649
missing a lot

2249
04:00:03,649 --> 04:00:07,969
Um, not enough where i'm annoyed where I want to continue to find everything

2250
04:00:08,530 --> 04:00:11,280
I want to turn these in

2251
04:00:11,280 --> 04:00:20,639
I swear if you don't 100% this game, I will shit in your hot sauce

2252
04:00:21,120 --> 04:00:25,520
It'll be hard to do the bottle is about three inches tall and like a tenth of a centimeter wide

2253
04:00:26,079 --> 04:00:28,239
For the hole so good luck. That's gonna be weird to do

2254
04:00:36,559 --> 04:00:39,680
All right wiggle. Where's wiggle wiggle wanted me to bring a sub

2255
04:00:40,319 --> 04:00:48,959
I got three quests done immediately need two sandapeds. Uh, oh

2256
04:00:51,379 --> 04:00:53,540
Need two. Oh, this is very important sub

2257
04:00:54,159 --> 04:00:55,219
sandapeds

2258
04:00:55,219 --> 04:00:57,219
Not I gotta okay

2259
04:00:59,680 --> 04:01:02,180
Sandwich nose and

2260
04:01:05,059 --> 04:01:06,659
sandwiched teeth

2261
04:01:06,659 --> 04:01:09,729
That's just onions

2262
04:01:13,120 --> 04:01:15,360
This is my favorite character

2263
04:01:15,360 --> 04:01:17,360
I'd rather do the uh quest for her

2264
04:01:19,200 --> 04:01:21,440
But it's just

2265
04:01:22,159 --> 04:01:24,159
It's the creative process

2266
04:01:24,879 --> 04:01:27,440
Do you know how I wrote do the wiggle?

2267
04:01:30,739 --> 04:01:33,299
Tell me to the studio two hours bacon

2268
04:01:33,940 --> 04:01:38,579
I hadn't slept in five days and I was holding a banjo for some reason

2269
04:01:39,139 --> 04:01:45,379
I couldn't remember my own name much less what I was gonna say. I love the lean down side to side

2270
04:01:45,780 --> 04:01:47,780
That's my favorite animation

2271
04:01:48,500 --> 04:01:51,459
While the wiggle is going on lean in wiggle wiggle lean in

2272
04:01:51,700 --> 04:02:02,059
And apparently I'd invented banjo pop needless to say it's been a hard act to follow but wait, what else do you need?

2273
04:02:04,110 --> 04:02:07,870
Are you ready to help me top the chart? Yes, I want to do whatever you want me to do

2274
04:02:12,989 --> 04:02:13,950
Bye

2275
04:02:13,950 --> 04:02:26,299
Okay, catch one white cheap hoof

2276
04:02:27,709 --> 04:02:33,760
I can do that

2277
04:02:33,760 --> 04:02:35,760
You're simping for a muppet

2278
04:02:37,739 --> 04:02:39,260
Don't you dare?

2279
04:02:39,260 --> 04:02:41,260
Talk about my queen like that again

2280
04:02:48,879 --> 04:02:52,559
Uh, where are the white cheap hoofs?

2281
04:02:52,559 --> 04:02:55,920
That's a regular cheap hoof. That's a regular cheap hoof. Where's the white one?

2282
04:02:56,479 --> 04:03:03,739
You forgot about chanlo. Here's the problem with chanlo. I gave two sandwiches

2283
04:03:04,700 --> 04:03:06,719
therefore

2284
04:03:06,719 --> 04:03:09,500
therefore

2285
04:03:09,500 --> 04:03:13,659
Uh, I I he needed three meaty snacks and I got rid of two of them

2286
04:03:14,909 --> 04:03:20,909
So I will pick up a meaty snack here while I get a white cheap hoof

2287
04:03:21,790 --> 04:03:24,590
I just heard something like crawl across my desk in real life

2288
04:03:25,979 --> 04:03:26,940
and

2289
04:03:26,940 --> 04:03:30,000
I'm freaking out. Don't know what that was. It was very strange

2290
04:03:30,399 --> 04:03:32,479
I hope that's nothing sinister. Okay

2291
04:03:34,299 --> 04:03:35,659
white cheap hoof

2292
04:03:35,659 --> 04:03:45,920
white cheap hoof

2293
04:03:45,920 --> 04:03:47,920
Um, where does the white cheap hoof spawn?

2294
04:03:53,979 --> 04:03:56,299
Don't say centipede. That's the most terrifying animal on earth

2295
04:03:56,940 --> 04:04:16,450
It's at night. Oh at night. I need to sleep then centipedes are terrifying. They really are

2296
04:04:31,389 --> 04:04:35,860
I I mean people say they're all they're cool. They're cool. They're cool. I

2297
04:04:37,520 --> 04:04:38,959
Okay. Oh, I want to have one as a pet

2298
04:04:38,959 --> 04:04:42,479
I want to keep one but I I gauge if I want something in my house or not

2299
04:04:42,879 --> 04:04:45,120
If I don't want it to hurt me and if I can

2300
04:04:45,760 --> 04:04:48,180
interact with it

2301
04:04:48,180 --> 04:04:52,659
Like standing across your room while you look at like a giant emperor scorpion with binoculars

2302
04:04:52,979 --> 04:04:55,780
Whoa, that's fucking scary and it could kill it could hurt me

2303
04:04:56,659 --> 04:05:06,319
No, I don't want that. Oh

2304
04:05:06,719 --> 04:05:10,930
That'd be sure horrible if that got out of its cage. I got a dog

2305
04:05:12,129 --> 04:05:13,569
I don't want that

2306
04:05:13,569 --> 04:05:16,420
If I get a centipede

2307
04:05:16,420 --> 04:05:21,620
And you have animals in your house or something. What if it ever got out and like it attacked your dog or something?

2308
04:05:24,750 --> 04:05:27,549
If you're into that crazy wild shit, like that's um

2309
04:05:28,110 --> 04:05:38,670
Power to you. Really? I that's cool. Not for me at all. Keep them in the ground. You're sleeping

2310
04:05:41,579 --> 04:05:43,420
Centipedes aren't aggressive

2311
04:05:43,420 --> 04:05:49,139
Centipedes aren't aggressive

2312
04:05:49,139 --> 04:06:02,340
Until they feel like they are threatened which it could be anything. Yes, they are. Yes, they are

2313
04:06:02,500 --> 04:06:03,700
I don't know anything about centipedes

2314

2388
04:13:35,149 --> 04:13:37,149

04:19:48,030 --> 04:19:48,989
and then

2446
04:19:48,989 --> 04:20:00,850
How do I capture him try to get the read?

2447
04:20:02,559 --> 04:20:06,799
Try to get the drop on it. I he smashes into a statue and then what do I do?

2448
04:20:06,879 --> 04:20:08,879
Do I jump on his top of his body?

2449
04:20:13,739 --> 04:20:15,739
conveniently built beneath us

2450
04:20:24,750 --> 04:20:27,389
Come over here kids. I've got a toy to play with

2451
04:20:28,190 --> 04:20:30,909
Shoot the rpg at it. Everybody's silent

2452
04:20:38,750 --> 04:20:39,709
Got him

2453
04:20:39,709 --> 04:20:48,399
Come over here friends

2454
04:20:48,399 --> 04:21:01,219
Don't touch that

2455
04:21:01,219 --> 04:21:05,250
All right, break him. I'm gonna do it probably three

2456
04:21:06,129 --> 04:21:08,370
If it's like every single super mario enemy, it's three

2457
04:21:16,750 --> 04:21:25,139
No, stop hanging

2458
04:21:25,139 --> 04:21:26,579
He's broken

2459
04:21:26,579 --> 04:21:27,940
broken

2460
04:21:27,940 --> 04:21:29,940
Oh, he's mad now though

2461
04:21:30,420 --> 04:21:35,729
very

2462
04:21:42,319 --> 04:22:10,930
Let's go, let's go. Oh, he just got his ass kicked

2463
04:22:10,930 --> 04:22:13,100
What

2464
04:22:30,500 --> 04:22:38,840
Oh, it's just a little baby he got plowed he got absolutely steamrolled

2465
04:22:42,579 --> 04:22:48,430
Thanks, bro. That bug could have killed me. It was way strong dog

2466
04:22:48,750 --> 04:22:53,250
And once I eat it i'll be just I kind of don't I kind of want to donate this

2467
04:22:55,659 --> 04:23:03,680
I want to donate this wouldn't it be more interesting eat one of these first

2468
04:23:07,819 --> 04:23:14,799
He needs it fine

2469
04:23:17,969 --> 04:23:19,969
Just the same chandlo

2470
04:23:20,290 --> 04:23:25,170
And chandlo isn't super mario noise. No is my whole life climbing a mountain

2471
04:23:25,649 --> 04:23:31,790
Once I got to the peak all I saw was a taller mountain make him full melon

2472
04:23:32,670 --> 04:23:34,670
Even if I could rip out that stuff

2473
04:23:35,069 --> 04:23:42,459
Full melon with the mario nose. There's always going to be something bigger than me stronger than me

2474
04:23:43,680 --> 04:23:45,840
Snorpy's always going to be in danger

2475
04:23:52,139 --> 04:23:54,139
Are they all hate themselves?

2476
04:23:54,850 --> 04:23:56,850
And it's kind of a general theme here, right?

2477
04:24:02,510 --> 04:24:04,989
All right. Let's I want to let's turn them into a full melon though

2478
04:24:08,510 --> 04:24:42,219
Full melon chalcomist. I deserve it. Why else would you run away to drug snacks island? Is that the end of his quest line?

2479
04:24:42,700 --> 04:25:02,719
I think it is. So what else?

2480
04:25:05,819 --> 04:25:20,350
Donation right? I think I can do the donations one more because maybe that'll end his quest line. Yeah

2481
04:25:20,909 --> 04:25:22,909
All right. That's it. The size of your heart has grown

2482
04:25:23,309 --> 04:25:27,790
It can't get any bigger but donating is still a nice thing to do. All right. Well, that's maxed out

2483
04:25:35,579 --> 04:25:37,780
Very very cool. Okay

2484
04:25:37,780 --> 04:25:40,579
Uh, who else have I not what's do I care about?

2485
04:25:55,920 --> 04:26:18,670
Wait wiggle gets inspired. Oh, you kidding me. I hear music. Wait, where does it come from?

2486
04:26:18,989 --> 04:26:30,370
All right, wiggle gets inspired. Let's go to wiggle's house. I heard that you were inspired. Tell me what you need

2487
04:26:30,450 --> 04:26:32,819
I will get anything you want

2488
04:26:35,840 --> 04:26:37,760
Last is the

2489
04:26:37,760 --> 04:26:47,059
Bug snack out in the ocean seen it riding the waves in the morning to be honest. I'm not even sure if it's real

2490
04:26:47,700 --> 04:26:49,700
But I'm the big boss bud

2491
04:26:50,180 --> 04:26:53,700
Please help me. I can't catch it alone

2492
04:26:56,379 --> 04:26:58,379
This is gonna be great

2493
04:27:00,459 --> 04:27:13,120
Dance with the dragon

2494
04:27:13,120 --> 04:27:20,049
Yeah, every side quest ends up with a legendary bug snack. That's right. My critics. All right, you know

2495
04:27:21,100 --> 04:27:23,100
I can't make the magic happen again

2496
04:27:23,420 --> 04:27:28,780
I've tried sky diving crystal gorging reverse exorcisms everything

2497
04:27:30,059 --> 04:27:36,430
Bug snacks are the only thing that have ever gotten me stayed again. Wait, are you talking about you need to

2498
04:27:38,750 --> 04:27:40,750
Take drug snacks

2499
04:27:40,750 --> 04:27:42,750
Just sing a good song

2500
04:27:45,389 --> 04:27:47,389
Am I enabling this

2501
04:27:54,239 --> 04:27:56,239
Yes sing to us

2502
04:28:10,909 --> 04:28:20,450
Bobsicle don't give a shit about this. I would laugh so hard if bobsicle rammed her off the stage

2503
04:28:40,180 --> 04:28:42,340
That was awesome. So glad we got to see it

2504
04:29:01,889 --> 04:29:06,690
We set these lights up. Oh

2505
04:29:09,780 --> 04:29:11,780
Oh, that's huge

2506
04:29:12,500 --> 04:29:14,500
Come on, let's make some music

2507
04:29:16,100 --> 04:29:16,979

2508
04:29:16,979 --> 04:29:18,979
Catch the mega maki

2509
04:29:22,579 --> 04:29:26,420
Mega maki the head of the beast it can't be caught until it's run out of followers

2510
04:29:27,790 --> 04:29:29,389
they follow behind

2511
04:29:29,389 --> 04:29:31,549
the head in a perfect form

2512
04:29:32,430 --> 04:29:39,790
They're fucking raining down explosives on us. They fall behind the head in perfect formation and panic without its leader

2513
04:29:42,479 --> 04:29:43,520
Okay

2514
04:29:43,520 --> 04:29:47,809
Time to get tripped up here

2515
04:29:47,809 --> 04:30:07,790

04:30:28,479 --> 04:30:33,280
He's pissed

2522
04:30:43,459 --> 04:30:45,299
Hold on. I gotta catch them all

2523
04:30:45,299 --> 04:30:52,110
Where's it? Give me that

2524
04:30:52,110 --> 04:30:54,110
This shit's flying around now

2525
04:30:55,600 --> 04:30:58,399
Uh, does it come back in the water or is it gonna keep flying around?

2526
04:31:00,479 --> 04:31:04,719
Did I get to phase two?

2527
04:31:04,719 --> 04:31:09,069
Oh shit

2528
04:31:09,069 --> 04:31:16,290
Okay. Yep

2532
04:31:35,899 --> 04:31:38,209
Not high enough

2533
04:31:38,209 --> 04:31:40,209
No, it's gonna blow up this thing

2534
04:31:40,209 --> 04:31:47,090
No, it's not we're good

2535
04:31:47,090 --> 04:31:49,260
Shit fuck. I gotta get higher

2536
04:31:59,040 --> 04:32:01,040
I can't even put it on that high

2537
04:32:04,079 --> 04:32:14,940
This way

2538
04:32:14,940 --> 04:32:21,709
Here it comes through the hoop. I think I gotta get it over there actually scan the maki again

2539
04:32:22,270 --> 04:32:31,969
Hold on. He's not gonna go that way. I'd have to have to be that way

2540
04:32:32,780 --> 04:32:34,780
Yeah, it's gotta be like that

2541
04:32:35,440 --> 04:32:36,719
Actually my turn

2542
04:32:36,719 --> 04:33:01,280
Give me this. Yeah right here. Do not break this don't break it. All right, we're good

2543
04:33:03,870 --> 04:33:12,659
Motherfucker

2544
04:33:12,659 --> 04:33:14,659
Don't break the tree either, please

2545
04:33:14,819 --> 04:33:20,639
I think that's good. Is that in a good spot?

2546
04:33:23,779 --> 04:33:25,619
All they all come back. That's good

2547
04:33:25,619 --> 04:33:37,439
That's a bit as a better spot over here then

2548
04:33:37,520 --> 04:33:40,000
You gotta get so close to put the stupid thing up there. All right

2549
04:33:41,119 --> 04:33:49,599
I hate being in the water to do this shit

2550
04:33:53,869 --> 04:33:55,869
I'm just standing over here. Fuck it

2551
04:34:00,909 --> 04:34:04,240
That'll do it. Here we go

2552
04:34:11,439 --> 04:34:16,939
Get back here mini maki

2553
04:34:16,939 --> 04:34:35,069
All right, not much left

2554
04:34:35,069 --> 04:34:50,270
There it is

2555
04:34:50,270 --> 04:34:53,180
and

2556
04:34:53,180 --> 04:34:56,700
Only three more to collect and there's no more get back here

2557
04:35:02,209 --> 04:35:10,720
Now you're just it's just his head. Oh, it's kind of sad

2558
04:35:11,119 --> 04:35:36,130
I want to put him back where he belongs in the water. You're gonna eat this. That's not nice beat him to your queen

2559
04:35:36,610 --> 04:35:39,599
Well, this is where I make a choice

2560
04:35:40,240 --> 04:35:45,810
This world is indifferent to kindness

2561
04:36:01,680 --> 04:36:04,049
This is a ball of yarn

2562
04:36:11,659 --> 04:36:14,220
Do the wiggle we're gonna get a final song

2563
04:36:16,580 --> 04:36:19,709
That will be my legacy

2564
04:36:19,709 --> 04:36:26,529
Can I make it happen one more can't the universe give me one more?

2565
04:36:33,919 --> 04:36:40,259
So you just ate a legendary endangered species creature that there's only like three of on earth

2566
04:36:40,580 --> 04:36:49,459
Because you thought it was going to give you superpowers to write a song and the other guy thought it was going to give him super strength

2567
04:36:49,939 --> 04:36:53,659
Oh, here comes the lesson

2568
04:36:53,659 --> 04:36:55,840
Right. Yeah, the lesson's incoming

2569
04:36:56,240 --> 04:37:02,189
We're gonna get like a wizard of oz. Hey, you had a heart the whole time. It's in there and you wanted a brain

2570
04:37:02,270 --> 04:37:04,639
Of course, you have a brain

2571
04:37:04,639 --> 04:37:16,610
Elizabeth's gonna come up or whatever. Lizbert's gonna show up as the wizard of fucking snackberg all coked out too

2572
04:37:17,180 --> 04:38:11,900
Very clearly. I never caught one of those that one. All right fail ball once not yet. I'm not ready yet

2573
04:38:12,060 --> 04:38:15,659
I'm not done yet. We I want to see maybe I want to see one more mega

2574
04:38:16,580 --> 04:38:23,299
Animal not time for party. We were halfway through

2575
04:38:23,939 --> 04:38:28,500
Becca's quest line. I did remember I and like yesterday I did a ton of her side stuff

2576
04:38:28,580 --> 04:38:36,369
I didn't finish it spy on people. I did that for like an hour last night. I got I might as well at least complete it

2577
04:38:45,330 --> 04:38:52,500
Did you do it? Did you write your mapis? Oh, sorry, dear

2578
04:38:53,419 --> 04:38:55,419
It's never going to happen

2579
04:38:55,900 --> 04:38:58,139
Don't be so down wiggle

2580
04:38:58,299 --> 04:39:03,810
Maybe you're overthinking it. Aren't you just from the heart from the heart?

2581
04:39:05,380 --> 04:39:12,580
Grambling you sweet summer child. Oh, that's not what I meant. I'm talking about eating the heart of the giant supreme moth

2582
04:39:13,779 --> 04:39:16,909
What did you think I meant?

2583
04:39:18,830 --> 04:39:27,869
Because I and I've seen time and time again that when I write for myself nobody else wants to hear it

2584
04:39:28,430 --> 04:39:32,720
Well, that's a nice sentiment

2585
04:39:33,419 --> 04:39:35,419
Celebrities resident sleeper

2586
04:39:42,099 --> 04:39:44,099
All right

2587
04:39:48,750 --> 04:39:52,400
Where's becca becca

2588
04:39:52,959 --> 04:39:58,900
Where's becca?

2589
04:39:58,900 --> 04:40:01,889
Main story main story is over

2590
04:40:01,889 --> 04:40:04,930
The finale is the thing that I start next. Wait, wasn't he just

2591
04:40:05,569 --> 04:40:11,090
Weren't you just over there?

2592
04:40:11,090 --> 04:40:26,020
Where did he where's becca? I swear to god. I can't burn these stupid houses into my memory

2593
04:40:26,819 --> 04:40:29,099
I'm never gonna know where they are

2594
04:40:29,099 --> 04:40:36,939
All the same house. There's a different color stripe like ninja turtle stripe on them. I know they're color-coded. I know

2595
04:40:37,580 --> 04:40:39,979
But like I think I've paid attention to what who's who?

2596
04:40:40,700 --> 04:40:49,520
You walked past her moron. I'm not a moron. You're a moron. Hey there bestie

2597
04:40:50,860 --> 04:40:55,900
Crumdo I know that greedy crumb bag has some juicy dirt. Okay, i'm sure you'll find something good

2598
04:40:56,380 --> 04:40:58,380
So what it's crumdo

2599
04:41:02,099 --> 04:41:05,700
Find out what crumdo does at midnight. What time is it right now? Oh fuck

2600
04:41:06,419 --> 04:41:18,939
What are you doing in here? I'm gonna sleep in his bed until

2601
04:41:20,299 --> 04:41:35,419
Okay, what do you do at midnight? Let's find out he sleeps

2602
04:41:36,450 --> 04:41:45,259
like most people

2603
04:41:45,259 --> 04:41:48,220
All right. This game's really cool because it's sort of a weird

2604
04:41:49,299 --> 04:41:51,299
10 to 20 mix

2605
04:41:51,709 --> 04:41:52,669
of

2606
04:41:52,669 --> 04:41:54,430
animal crossing

2607
04:41:54,430 --> 04:41:57,520
pokemon

2608
04:41:57,520 --> 04:42:02,400
Almost like like stardew vibes too. Like you can plant stuff and cultivate bug snacks

2609
04:42:07,630 --> 04:42:09,709
And like people like each other. They hate each other

2610
04:42:14,909 --> 04:42:16,590
Even pinata. Yeah

2611
04:42:16,590 --> 04:42:19,470
It's a mix of a bunch of these games

2612
04:42:27,900 --> 04:42:34,779
Is somebody there you didn't hear anything pal. You got that not a single wait, that's wiggles big hit. He's drunk

2615
04:42:56,220 --> 04:42:58,639
Look, he dances to music. What a shocker

2616
04:43:02,060 --> 04:43:06,430
M g that's why he's always so jealous of wiggle

2617
04:43:07,150 --> 04:43:10,080
Would he even hide that?

2618
04:43:10,080 --> 04:43:12,080
It almost makes him kind of likable

2619
04:43:12,479 --> 04:43:16,180
Okay, the big scoop

2620
04:43:16,180 --> 04:43:17,779

You think i'm the only one who's sick of your gossip girl stick oh peter

2627
04:43:58,639 --> 04:44:02,659
Sooner or later, you're gonna be back in your cave all by yourself

2628
04:44:04,000 --> 04:44:08,689
At least then I wouldn't have to hear your slimy voice

2629
04:44:09,549 --> 04:44:15,119
She sucks are we gonna get some redemption arc from her or she just sucked the whole game

2630
04:44:23,979 --> 04:44:26,139
Find three grumpy snack pods on the beach

2631
04:44:27,919 --> 04:44:43,119
Fine, that's not the beach. Is that the beach?

2632
04:44:45,200 --> 04:44:46,659
Am I insane?

2633
04:44:46,659 --> 04:44:50,419
Yeah, it is

2634
04:44:50,419 --> 04:44:52,259

2636
04:44:54,900 --> 04:44:58,099
That doesn't mean 100 the actual video game. That means what i'm done when I feel

2637
04:44:58,740 --> 04:45:00,740
Like I have completed the game for me

2638
04:45:01,919 --> 04:45:09,709
We'll see when that is

2639
04:45:09,709 --> 04:45:12,669
All right. We need grumpy snack pods on the beach

2640
04:45:21,650 --> 04:45:26,750
candy patch

2641
04:45:26,750 --> 04:45:29,150
The snack pods are just the chip bags, right?

2642
04:45:33,250 --> 04:45:35,250
Those are just pasted on random stones

2643
04:45:35,729 --> 04:45:37,860

2644
04:45:37,860 --> 04:45:42,959

Mm-hmm

Uh, wait, what about on the other side of this?

2653
04:46:30,430 --> 04:46:33,500
Probably on the other side of this, right?

2654
04:46:33,500 --> 04:46:36,130
Right, right, right, right

2655
04:46:39,439 --> 04:46:41,439

Yeah close enough

2658
04:46:46,380 --> 04:47:03,939
I don't see any others on the beach

2659
04:47:03,939 --> 04:47:07,200
Come on. Where are they? I missed one

2660
04:47:12,540 --> 04:47:14,540
Is this a scenario where they don't come out in the rain?

2661
04:47:15,459 --> 04:47:40,930
Or is this a scenario where they're just always around no matter what i'm just gonna find them. I thought that was one right there

2662
04:47:42,720 --> 04:47:46,540
inside log

2663
04:47:46,540 --> 04:47:47,900
All right, relax

2664
04:47:47,900 --> 04:47:59,060
That's not one

2665
04:47:59,060 --> 04:48:14,669
What are you talking about? You're great at pretending. I looked in almost every log

2666
04:48:14,990 --> 04:48:18,509
Somebody said to go in the what law that I looked in all the logs

2667
04:48:22,159 --> 04:48:31,500
I've seen every log

2668
04:48:31,500 --> 04:48:34,849
I've read all the logs

2669
04:48:34,849 --> 04:48:36,610
And a lot of you are bullshitters

2670
04:48:36,610 --> 04:48:49,139
What about over here?

2671
04:48:49,139 --> 04:48:53,619
Yeah, I i've read the logs. I see what you said three days ago versus what you said today

2672
04:48:54,340 --> 04:49:11,889
If you reload the area

2673
04:49:11,889 --> 04:49:18,209
No, there ain't no there ain't there ain't no this one. Okay. I need one more

2674
04:49:35,419 --> 04:49:38,880
All right, reload the zone last one in log

2675
04:49:41,919 --> 04:49:45,360
No, there's not i'm gonna reload the area because I do not believe you

2676
04:49:45,919 --> 04:49:47,279
I don't trust you

2677
04:49:47,279 --> 04:50:04,270
By the way, I want to just I have this to talk about too

2678
04:50:05,150 --> 04:50:09,549
So there's a theme song for this game that has this was made by a famous band

2679
04:50:09,790 --> 04:50:21,650
And I haven't heard it once the whole playthrough. What's the point of it being a theme song?

2680
04:50:21,729 --> 04:50:28,479
Is it a credit song? We'll find out famous in quotes. I don't know. I don't i've never heard of them

2681
04:50:29,119 --> 04:50:57,419
Is it just the trailer? It might be becky. Becky's not in her house. Where is she?

2682
04:51:00,509 --> 04:51:03,200
Becky, where's becky?

2683
04:51:03,680 --> 04:51:09,220
There's becky. Were you just videotaping filbert's bed?

2684
04:51:12,189 --> 04:51:25,439

2685
04:51:26,080 --> 04:51:38,240
Uh, thanks bestie

2686
04:51:44,189 --> 04:51:50,290

2687
04:51:54,130 --> 04:51:57,250
Fuck you. Fuck you. What? Oh my god

2688
04:51:58,130 --> 04:52:03,220

04:52:19,340 --> 04:52:22,900
Nothing new from you

2693
04:52:22,900 --> 04:52:25,060
Wait, that's it. You don't have it. You don't want me to do anything

2694
04:52:25,779 --> 04:52:27,779
What was the point of doing all that weird shit for you?

2695
04:52:28,099 --> 04:52:37,709
Have to wait a bit

2696
04:52:37,709 --> 04:52:39,709
All right, i'm gonna sleep again for like three days

2697
04:52:53,810 --> 04:52:59,360

And uh, it looks like i've been eating in my sleep, too

2773
05:04:43,619 --> 05:04:47,939
So if you see me sleepwalking wake me up sure to wake me up. Okay?

2774
05:04:48,979 --> 05:04:50,500
Sure, I will

2775
05:04:50,500 --> 05:04:55,250
I'm back

2776
05:04:55,250 --> 05:04:59,389
All right. Now what else we got?

2777
05:04:59,389 --> 05:05:03,459

Now that snorpy and chandlo are back. It's toad's snooping time

2780
05:05:10,259 --> 05:05:15,939
I never got any dirt on chandlo. He's got to have some deep dark secret, but whatever it is

2781
05:05:16,180 --> 05:05:22,020
He's too good. Stop simping for befrica. I i'm talking to someone that doesn't mean i'm simping for them

2782
05:05:22,659 --> 05:05:27,279
If I was a cashier at a grocery store or at a mall

2783
05:05:27,919 --> 05:05:30,479
And i've rung up a lady

2784
05:05:30,479 --> 05:05:32,479
Why are you shipping for that lady?

2785
05:05:32,740 --> 05:05:35,779
I'm ringing her up. She's buying things at the store

2786
05:05:39,680 --> 05:05:42,880
Anyways, please i'll do anything for you anything

2792
05:06:40,529 --> 05:06:42,509

2793
05:06:42,509 --> 05:06:44,509
Befica, where's his little green house?

2794
05:06:45,150 --> 05:06:49,330
He lives at the gym

2795
05:06:49,330 --> 05:06:55,630
Where is his house? I don't see does he not he's does he sleep in the mill?

2796
05:06:57,860 --> 05:07:00,560
Why is he sleeping in the mill?

2797
05:07:00,560 --> 05:07:01,599
the heck

2798
05:07:01,599 --> 05:07:02,959
What's wrong with you, dude?

2799
05:07:02,959 --> 05:07:08,159
Where's the stump snorpy? I removed it with my digging device. It took five minutes

2800
05:07:08,720 --> 05:07:10,619
Oh

2801
05:07:10,619 --> 05:07:15,119
What are you doing with your backside here, man? Anytime chandlo

2802
05:07:15,900 --> 05:07:19,939
This motherfucker looks like he's about to lay eggs

2803
05:07:20,740 --> 05:07:34,770
Okay, sleep until midnight. Why can't I can't sleep in his bed?

2804
05:07:37,310 --> 05:07:39,310
Oh, this is bullshit

2805
05:07:39,470 --> 05:07:50,270
I can't sleep in your bed either

2806
05:07:58,610 --> 05:08:00,610
What does he do at midnight?

2807
05:08:01,169 --> 05:08:18,860
Where's he at?

2808
05:08:18,860 --> 05:08:21,360
Uh, what is he doing?

2809
05:08:21,840 --> 05:08:25,360
Thing about being chandlo

2810
05:08:25,360 --> 05:08:27,360
What you see is what you get

2811
05:08:28,220 --> 05:08:30,290
I got nothing to hide

2812
05:08:30,290 --> 05:08:32,529
No shame

2813
05:08:32,529 --> 05:08:36,529
There's no dirt. You're checking out this beef bro. I don't blame you

2814
05:08:38,209 --> 05:08:50,689
He's just a normal weirdo

2815
05:08:50,770 --> 05:08:52,369
Uh, sorry becca

2816
05:08:52,369 --> 05:09:04,340
There's no dirt on this dude

2817
05:09:04,340 --> 05:09:05,299
Sorry

2818
05:09:05,299 --> 05:09:08,240
What's up? He's just a regular guy

2819
05:09:09,729 --> 05:09:11,729
Nobody is free of dirt

2820
05:09:11,729 --> 05:09:17,549
The more innocent somebody looks the nastier the secret. Trust me. I have an idea wake up at noon

2821
05:09:17,630 --> 05:09:19,630
Talk to someone go to bed till midnight

2822
05:09:20,180 --> 05:09:25,139
Nobody knows chandlo like snorpy. I need you to turn me into green bug snacks

2823
05:09:25,700 --> 05:09:28,180
I'll tell you why later green bug snacks

2824
05:09:28,819 --> 05:09:33,099
Turn becca's arms into green snacks. I think you already um

2825
05:09:33,819 --> 05:09:37,470
That is is the sushi

2826
05:09:37,709 --> 05:09:40,020
The maki roll green technically

2827
05:09:50,189 --> 05:10:05,810
No, really it's not green what about pickles, uh, I need to feed her a pickle

2828
05:10:08,909 --> 05:10:13,389
That looks so strange

2829
05:10:13,389 --> 05:10:15,310
This is this is okay

2830
05:10:15,310 --> 05:10:16,909
If you would have like

2831
05:10:16,990 --> 05:10:22,180
Uber eats sushi shit-faced. Yeah, this sushi's a good idea

2832
05:10:22,979 --> 05:10:26,610
Or if it's a uber eats it gets delivered to your house

2833
05:10:26,770 --> 05:10:28,450
Oh, yeah, this is what I want

2834
05:10:28,450 --> 05:10:31,970
You eat one of them and you just like drop the rest on the fucking couch

2835
05:10:32,369 --> 05:10:35,810
In the container and you wake up the next morning and this that's what the that's what it looks like

2836
05:10:36,369 --> 05:10:38,930
You ate one piece and the rest just fucking fell all over the place

2837
05:10:45,139 --> 05:10:50,419
Or you eat one piece you drop it all over the bed and then you go and like you puke

2838
05:10:52,020 --> 05:10:53,860
Sushi is a good idea

2839
05:10:53,860 --> 05:10:56,500
Give me I'll take two california rolls or two

2840
05:10:57,700 --> 05:10:59,700
spicy tuna rolls

2841
05:10:59,700 --> 05:11:11,790
Uber eats

2842
05:11:11,790 --> 05:11:13,790
I can't relate to that rich streamer

2843
05:11:16,509 --> 05:11:21,310
Sushi uber eats that's by the way, that's already a bad idea

2844
05:11:24,659 --> 05:11:27,779
So I I know people look i'm gonna get i'm gonna get shit for this

2845
05:11:28,740 --> 05:11:29,779
but

2846
05:11:29,779 --> 05:11:34,340
For me look, this is not for you. This is not your friends. It's not your parents. This is me

2847
05:11:35,229 --> 05:11:38,349
If I do not eat sushi sitting down at a sushi restaurant

2848
05:11:39,340 --> 05:11:40,619
Do I will not eat it?

2849
05:11:40,619 --> 05:11:47,259
I do not want it the sushi that's at like the grocery store the sushi that's at the gas station and ordering delivery sushi

2850
05:11:47,740 --> 05:11:48,619
I'm

2851
05:11:48,619 --> 05:11:58,080
Not into that at all. Sorry. We can't have our own personal sushi chefs. No, that's not what i'm saying

2852
05:11:58,159 --> 05:12:02,560
I'm just saying like I don't the the spicy tuna roll that's at the gas station

2853
05:12:03,630 --> 05:12:10,020
Something I I don't want to eat you everyone's saying delivery. That's true

2854
05:12:10,419 --> 05:12:14,659
You could like uber eats like we said that like, you know that little uh, the little routine there

2855
05:12:15,380 --> 05:12:17,139
Here's the problem

2856
05:12:17,139 --> 05:12:19,139
Sometimes when you order on those apps

2857
05:12:19,700 --> 05:12:27,299
Um, the guy or the girl doesn't fucking show up on time and you might be you might order your your takeaway sushi

2858
05:12:29,180 --> 05:12:31,180
and it shows up like

2859
05:12:31,479 --> 05:12:35,779
55 minutes later after they did like two or three deliveries before yours

2860
05:12:37,729 --> 05:12:40,209
Delivery sushi not gonna happen pick it up pick it up

2861
05:12:43,810 --> 05:12:49,709
Hey

2862
05:12:49,709 --> 05:12:51,889
Yes, you could pick it up

2863
05:12:52,590 --> 05:12:56,029
But i'm i'm just telling you delivery sushi i'm not okay with

2864
05:12:57,330 --> 05:12:59,810
Or gas station and grocery store sushi

2865
05:13:00,209 --> 05:13:04,930
I want to be at the restaurant want to see them make it because I don't know what I have no idea what from

2866
05:13:05,569 --> 05:13:11,650
No, that's reasonable and understandable. I gift that guy some

2867
05:13:13,299 --> 05:13:14,419
I'll do it

2868
05:13:14,419 --> 05:13:16,419
I don't know. I'm doing it

2869
05:13:19,569 --> 05:13:31,069
Somebody do it already. Where is it? What's your name? Too fast. There it is

2870
05:13:32,139 --> 05:13:36,139
Sheepish sheepish dialect you're getting a community sub. Did you already get it or am I doing it?

2871
05:13:49,290 --> 05:13:51,290
Nepotism here it comes nepotism

2872
05:13:57,060 --> 05:14:02,259
Pick me pick me

2873
05:14:02,259 --> 05:14:05,779
I am picking out the one person in chat that has pleased me

2874
05:14:06,500 --> 05:14:17,950
Did he already get one? He got one already. Wait, did he get one? I think he already has one

2875
05:14:18,349 --> 05:14:30,380
Do you have one? I can't hold on. Let me see if they have one

2876
05:14:38,639 --> 05:14:41,330
I

2877
05:14:42,450 --> 05:14:44,770
Can't even give it to him

2878
05:14:44,770 --> 05:14:47,090
Mostly lost already gave it to him. I can't even

2879
05:14:51,740 --> 05:14:55,520
Hey, well nice job. That's you deserve that for being a reasonable

2880
05:14:56,200 --> 05:15:05,279
Understandable person. Hey, I agree with you happy face. No, that's not how it works. It's only a one-time deal

2881
05:15:05,840 --> 05:15:08,459
I'm gonna go get some pickles

2882
05:15:08,459 --> 05:15:28,799
This guy sucks. Fuck you gift me a sub instead. You're you're like a you're like an eight year sub

2883
05:15:34,060 --> 05:15:38,740
Is this where the pickles are?

2884
05:15:38,900 --> 05:15:40,900
No, this is not where the pickles are

2885
05:15:48,590 --> 05:15:50,430
That's not a green vegetable

2886
05:15:50,430 --> 05:16:01,659
It's in flavor town, right? Yeah, i'm going the right way. When are you gonna do a ps5 raffle?

2887
05:16:03,229 --> 05:16:06,500
Uh, I would not hold your breath for that one

2888
05:16:11,459 --> 05:16:14,139
All right pickle time

2889
05:16:14,139 --> 05:16:16,220
Where is a pickle? There is a pickle

2890
05:16:23,060 --> 05:16:25,060
All right green snack. We got it leave

2891
05:16:25,459 --> 05:16:34,939
What the fuck what?

2892
05:16:34,939 --> 05:16:38,610
I love how I I want to say it so bad

2893
05:16:38,689 --> 05:16:42,450
But I can't you guys can all say it and you don't get it to attack each other for it

2894
05:16:45,779 --> 05:16:47,779
When I say it I make it real

2895
05:16:48,610 --> 05:17:11,439
When you say it apparently it's not real they didn't see what happens that sounds like a threat

2896
05:17:11,759 --> 05:17:20,020
I don't think i'm gonna follow up with that

2897
05:17:20,020 --> 05:17:21,700
Okay green

2898
05:17:21,700 --> 05:17:25,250
arms

2899
05:17:25,250 --> 05:17:27,810
Hey, becca

2900
05:17:27,810 --> 05:17:35,619
Eat this pickle

2901
05:17:35,700 --> 05:17:37,150
There you go

2902
05:17:37,150 --> 05:17:40,669
And let's give everybody's pickle, you know, just have everything be just total pickle

2903
05:17:43,650 --> 05:17:47,090
Perfect. Thanks bestie. Here's the plan

2904
05:17:48,290 --> 05:17:53,810
Snorpy basically can't see without his glasses. I'm pickle beffica them every day at five

2905
05:17:54,450 --> 05:18:00,049
So we'll approach him then and if i'm green and I say bro a lot he'll think i'm chandlo

2906
05:18:00,529 --> 05:18:04,130
And obviously snorpy isn't going to keep chandlo's secrets from himself

2907
05:18:07,310 --> 05:18:13,549
You know it bestie snorpy isn't going to know what hit him that's a lap to hang out until it's time

2908
05:18:18,080 --> 05:18:22,639
Hey snorp dog, can I like ask you something

2909
05:18:23,520 --> 05:18:25,279
Chandlo, is that you?

2910
05:18:25,360 --> 05:18:31,599
I can't see this guy's real glasses real dumb. Oh, there's no time bro. This is important

2911
05:18:32,509 --> 05:18:39,790
Oh, uh, well, all right then what is it bro? You remember that deep dark secret we were talking about

2912
05:18:40,669 --> 05:18:45,069
You know the really super secret one. Oh, ah

2913
05:18:46,189 --> 05:18:48,029
That yes

2914
05:18:48,029 --> 05:18:50,029
I suppose it is time we talked about it

2915
05:18:51,150 --> 05:18:54,830
Chandlo, it's hard for me to know what he's getting bore at it

2916
05:18:55,470 --> 05:19:02,290
I've been afraid of talking about it for so long, but the truth is that was good. I love that was really good

2917
05:19:05,299 --> 05:19:12,180
That's not a secret to anybody beffica. What did you get here? How dare you intrude on our private moment?

2918
05:19:13,619 --> 05:19:19,299
Bro, she just ran off dog like he's gonna start tucking his pants in stop

2919
05:19:22,139 --> 05:19:26,540
Anybody

2920
05:19:26,619 --> 05:19:29,500
Hey

2921
05:19:34,779 --> 05:19:38,220
I love the marshmallow nose, but I think he deserves a pickle nose

2922
05:19:54,610 --> 05:19:57,330
Minion yeah, he looks like a minion, but it doesn't sound like a minion

2923
05:19:58,689 --> 05:20:00,689
He didn't go

2924
05:20:05,490 --> 05:20:11,650
He didn't do any of that

2925
05:20:11,650 --> 05:20:15,970
That's that was stitch. That was less. Uh minion more stitch

2926
05:20:18,349 --> 05:20:20,669
The same damn look they sound exactly the same

2927
05:20:27,700 --> 05:20:31,259
Hey, i'm sorry, dude. Did I like offend you with that?

2928
05:20:33,299 --> 05:20:35,860
I said stitch and the minions are like the exact same

2929
05:20:36,500 --> 05:20:38,500
He's very very shocked about that

2930
05:20:43,009 --> 05:20:46,770
Yeah, and guess what murlocs and stitch and minions are the same too

2931
05:20:51,119 --> 05:20:53,139
And so are the jawas

2932
05:20:53,139 --> 05:20:57,139
The jawas the murlocs the stitches they all they're all the same. They all talk the same

2933
05:21:02,639 --> 05:21:06,240
To the journal this time we're heading for the boiling bay

2934
05:21:10,819 --> 05:21:12,819
They all go like

2935
05:21:16,580 --> 05:21:33,819
Yes, they do they all do it's just funny gibberish with a high pitch that's lemmings

2936
05:21:33,979 --> 05:21:43,720
Yes, why did somebody say

2937
05:21:54,400 --> 05:21:56,720
He's right give me a sub, please

2938
05:22:10,110 --> 05:22:14,509
Hashtag kill germo what guys I said jawas and minions talk the same

2939
05:22:15,229 --> 05:22:19,139
You're gonna you're gonna roast me over the fire for that

2940
05:22:52,049 --> 05:23:11,259
Which was which tell me that was two different audios two different clips

2941
05:23:11,740 --> 05:23:21,729
Which was which both of them in first one was minions first one was jawa

2942
05:23:51,889 --> 05:24:05,569
Some of you guys can't tell the difference how what if I told you that it was both minions lay them over each other

2943
05:24:28,610 --> 05:24:30,450
What was with the music

2944
05:24:30,450 --> 05:24:37,889
All right. Well that one's easy because that the unti d the minions don't do that

2945
05:24:38,529 --> 05:24:51,330
scan a treasure chest

2946
05:24:57,310 --> 05:25:01,340
Oh shit, what about stitch?

2947
05:25:02,819 --> 05:25:12,220
I've thought we're not going into the we're not going into the weeds here. All right scan a treasure chest and report feed

2948
05:25:13,259 --> 05:25:22,110
Oh, I always know. All right, the jawas and the minions of the stitches they they have very similar dialect

2949
05:25:22,189 --> 05:25:23,150
Okay

2950
05:25:23,150 --> 05:25:25,950
I I know it for a fact that you can't prove me wrong

2951
05:25:28,189 --> 05:25:31,790
And the rabbits too were the raving rabbits. Do should we pull out the raving rabbits?

2952
05:25:36,240 --> 05:25:38,720
Stitch is nothing like those two

2953
05:25:39,979 --> 05:25:41,490
All right

2954
05:25:41,490 --> 05:25:48,509
Over. All right. I need to scan a treasure chest

2955
05:25:50,290 --> 05:25:57,709
Where is a treasure chest?

2956
05:26:13,099 --> 05:26:21,180
One what about every germa voice is the same voice we're not talking about me right now

2957
05:26:21,259 --> 05:26:38,000
We're talking about minions jawas and rabbits. Where's there a treasure chest? All right, let me talk to you again

2958
05:26:38,000 --> 05:26:39,360
Maybe you'll tell me where it is

2959
05:26:39,360 --> 05:26:51,619
If you don't mind your eyes peeled for a treasure chest and a freezing cold bully of a bug sna-

2960
05:27:01,200 --> 05:27:03,200
Mmm treasure chest

2961
05:27:09,759 --> 05:27:14,110
Sounds like minions to me

2962
05:27:22,669 --> 05:27:24,669
I found a treasure chest

2963
05:27:33,950 --> 05:27:37,470
Yeah, I I didn't know that everybody was gonna be so defending the minions

2964
05:27:43,169 --> 05:27:46,610
I don't know. We were gonna get some some some real minion defense in here

2965
05:27:47,250 --> 05:27:50,900
Oh wait, is it because I said stitch and minions that settles it. I think that's what happened

2966
05:27:50,900 --> 05:27:56,529
This ship belonged to grump beard. He disappeared at sea a hundred years ago

2967
05:27:57,090 --> 05:27:59,889
But I guess he wound up on snack tooth island

2968
05:28:00,450 --> 05:28:06,369
Hard to tell what happened to him after that his bones could be just about anywhere

2969
05:28:07,409 --> 05:28:09,409
You're right. You should say it

2970
05:28:10,450 --> 05:28:12,049
I'll defend stitch

2971
05:28:12,049 --> 05:28:14,049
Well, maybe stitch should have been in there

2972
05:28:14,209 --> 05:28:16,209
I haven't heard stitch in a long time

2973
05:28:18,000 --> 05:28:20,159
All right. Now we got to feed tiffany a pale toss

2974
05:28:30,430 --> 05:28:35,540
That's a backtrack

2975
05:28:36,619 --> 05:28:45,069
Whoa

2976
05:28:45,069 --> 05:28:47,090
Whoa, I don't like this

2977
05:28:47,090 --> 05:28:53,090
You know flutey's got a theory that the bigger a bug snack is we're defending stitch

2978
05:28:53,729 --> 05:29:00,830
No telling yet was around in grump beards time

2979
05:29:01,549 --> 05:29:03,950
It could have even chased him off the beach

2980
05:29:04,590 --> 05:29:06,590
Fun to think about eh

2981
05:29:06,669 --> 05:29:14,340
Pickle germa, I can't find anything

2982
05:29:15,299 --> 05:29:17,299
She's not gonna wreck them all please

2983
05:29:18,020 --> 05:29:27,470
I didn't mean to keep it from you, but that journal it um belonged to my

2984
05:29:31,310 --> 05:29:32,830
Some years ago

2985
05:29:32,830 --> 05:29:38,909
My grandma chronic a lot of blog decided she was gonna explore something about she lost a lot of blood

2986
05:29:39,549 --> 05:29:43,069
Discover its history. Oh, she had she wrote a blog

2987
05:29:44,509 --> 05:29:49,709
That's really why i'm out here to find out what became of her

2988
05:29:52,209 --> 05:29:54,209
Anywho, that's all for now

2989
05:29:55,090 --> 05:29:59,380
Let's head back to town

2990
05:29:59,380 --> 05:30:01,380
Catch one scoopy banoopy

2991
05:30:01,779 --> 05:30:06,369
Are you listening to that?

2992
05:30:06,369 --> 05:30:08,369
You little shit eavesdropper

2993
05:30:11,819 --> 05:30:14,220
Don't fucking tell anybody that don't leak that conversation

2994
05:30:16,020 --> 05:30:18,639
I'll know who did

2995
05:30:18,639 --> 05:30:25,040
Right. It's a golden quibble. I gotta get him. I changed my mind. I'm just gonna take you

2996
05:30:25,599 --> 05:30:33,360
What does he like?

2997
05:30:33,360 --> 05:30:42,770
Loves chocolate. Okay, cool. I mean, I kind of need the golden quibble, right?

2998
05:30:43,330 --> 05:30:59,549
Remember your niece is watching. I don't think so. I don't think they know what this game is

2999
05:31:00,270 --> 05:31:07,889
Long time viewer first time watcher. Wait, what?

3000
05:31:20,619 --> 05:31:22,619
That doesn't mean that didn't make any sense, right?

3001
05:31:27,709 --> 05:31:31,470
Long time watcher first time viewer here. How's it going? I think I've read that wrong

3002
05:31:46,349 --> 05:31:48,029
All right. What about uh

3003
05:31:48,029 --> 05:31:51,139
Crummy, where is he?

3004
05:31:51,139 --> 05:31:55,040
Anything new from crummy?

3005
05:31:55,040 --> 05:31:58,400
Hey mind your own beeswax. There is something from crummy. Let's go

3006
05:31:59,119 --> 05:32:01,119
Ready to get rich. Yeah

3007
05:32:01,360 --> 05:32:05,599
Hope you got your sunglasses pal because we're heading to the sizzling sands

3008
05:32:06,720 --> 05:32:29,490
I'm trying to see

3009
05:32:29,490 --> 05:32:31,360

3010
05:32:31,360 --> 05:32:38,880

3011
05:32:40,400 --> 05:32:42,400

3012
05:32:48,939 --> 05:32:53,830
Oh, this is for the pizza, right? We're gonna go we're gonna get the big pizza

3013
05:33:04,189 --> 05:33:12,580
Could use a good slicing

3014
05:33:12,659 --> 05:33:17,299
Hey check it out an old timey casket an old tomb what if there's treasure in there

3015
05:33:19,700 --> 05:33:23,819
You're gonna summon them don't do it. Yeah, whatever onto the real price

3016
05:33:24,779 --> 05:33:28,939
Sarcophagus this ancient stone coffin is stuck shut. Perhaps it needs to be cut open

3017
05:33:29,500 --> 05:33:32,259
Do we have a cutting tool or something eventually here?

3018
05:33:33,139 --> 05:33:37,060
This is the place looks like we got to do something to call the bug snack out

3019
05:33:37,779 --> 05:33:40,279
Should be a switch right about

3020
05:33:40,680 --> 05:33:42,680
Oh

3021
05:33:47,970 --> 05:33:49,970

Whoa, that is something. All right

3023
05:33:54,740 --> 05:33:56,979
But it looks like we still got to blow this thing open

3024
05:33:57,459 --> 05:34:01,700
See if there's anything good and explosive around here. How about the dive bombing bug snack?

3025
05:34:05,139 --> 05:34:07,139
Or the ancient pizza cutter?

3026
05:34:12,520 --> 05:34:17,619
Uh, okay, we're gonna use the ancient pizza cutter on the ancient sarcophagus

3027
05:34:21,220 --> 05:34:25,240
Bombino when threatened this bug snack becomes an explosive bomb

3028
05:34:25,880 --> 05:34:29,990
Okay, what do you like?

3029
05:34:29,990 --> 05:34:31,590

Mysterious altar this altar has a slot on top that perfectly fits the launch pad perhaps the launch

3037
05:35:45,540 --> 05:35:49,759
Needs to be placed here, whatever

3038
05:35:56,259 --> 05:35:59,959

All right. What do I do?

I definitely have to okay. We have to launch the bombs at him

3044
05:36:13,540 --> 05:36:16,720
Come here

3045
05:36:16,720 --> 05:36:18,720
Stop being on fire. Why are they all on fire?

3046
05:36:28,159 --> 05:36:30,159
Why they already all are burnt up and

3047
05:36:36,259 --> 05:36:37,299

05:36:37,299 --> 05:36:49,119

No, wait, I gotta cut him. I gotta cut him. We gotta cut him

3052
05:37:04,259 --> 05:37:08,630
He has to go over here. How do I attract him over here?

3053
05:37:09,189 --> 05:37:18,639
Because then i'm gonna i gotta cut through his body

3054
05:37:19,279 --> 05:37:25,619
There are more than one

3055
05:37:25,860 --> 05:37:35,540
Cutter we didn't unlock the other cutters

3056
05:37:36,180 --> 05:37:47,360
All right slice him up

3057
05:37:48,880 --> 05:37:50,000
Is that

3058
05:37:50,000 --> 05:37:51,360
Where'd he go?

3059
05:37:51,360 --> 05:38:18,360
There we go. Ow

05:38:33,750 --> 05:38:40,069
I want to aim the launcher

3063
05:38:40,069 --> 05:38:41,189
All right. Give me back

3064
05:38:41,189 --> 05:38:58,959
You're on I don't want that. I want this a final slice. It went over his head

3065
05:38:59,840 --> 05:39:01,840
Wait, did it get went over his head?

3066
05:39:04,000 --> 05:39:11,750
Why did it fly over him?

3067
05:39:13,250 --> 05:39:16,209
I didn't even do anything. I didn't do anything. He fell

3068
05:39:22,869 --> 05:39:25,319
Mothra supreme, huh?

3069
05:39:25,319 --> 05:39:35,750
Not so supreme anymore

3070
05:39:35,750 --> 05:39:40,209
Sad for a week those new bug snacks. I could just buy new lungs

3071
05:39:42,500 --> 05:39:44,020
Here you go

3072
05:39:44,020 --> 05:39:49,459
That was sad

3073
05:39:49,459 --> 05:39:52,740
Oh, the pizza nose is just pepperoni. It's not a full pizza circle

3074
05:39:53,459 --> 05:39:56,740
Let's go home and we'll count up the spoils said mom mom

3075
05:40:02,040 --> 05:40:04,119
That's really sad. That was kind of fucked up what you said

3076
05:40:04,840 --> 05:40:15,889
This game is sad

3077
05:40:15,889 --> 05:40:17,430
Yeah, it is

3078
05:40:17,430 --> 05:40:21,189
All right. I got two I got one I got becca's quest line to do

3079
05:40:21,830 --> 05:40:24,069
And then i'll probably just end i'll finish the game there

3080
05:40:24,630 --> 05:40:30,049
I'm so far into becca's quest line that why would I not do it?

3081
05:40:30,529 --> 05:40:45,569
This game has been very very fun

3082
05:40:45,810 --> 05:40:48,240
How much is wait, how much is this game?

3083
05:40:49,349 --> 05:40:51,349
Very important question. How much is this game?

3084
05:40:51,590 --> 05:40:52,950
I don't even forgot

3085
05:40:52,950 --> 05:41:00,880
This game is 25 was 20 30 bucks

3086
05:41:01,840 --> 05:41:07,860
Absolutely worth it 100 percent

3087
05:41:07,860 --> 05:41:09,540
24 99

3088
05:41:09,540 --> 05:41:11,540
It is 1 million percent worth it

3089
05:41:17,880 --> 05:41:21,880
Do I owe the dishonor cut the grump crum dough?

3090
05:41:22,439 --> 05:41:24,759
You're gonna give me a piece of that pie

3091
05:41:25,000 --> 05:41:27,319
It's a solid 10 to 12 hours of game

3092
05:41:28,279 --> 05:41:30,279
And then there's other little secret

3093
05:41:31,040 --> 05:41:34,049
Bugs you can collect

3094
05:41:34,049 --> 05:41:37,169
To see all these pictures of you stealing trippany stuff

3095
05:41:37,569 --> 05:41:41,169
There's a probably 15 to 20 hours of content here if you wanted it right now

3096
05:41:43,479 --> 05:41:45,479
And it's fun and it's cute

3097
05:41:47,169 --> 05:41:54,930
You win take a bet hand yours over no need. I'd never sell out my bestie

3098
05:41:55,810 --> 05:42:01,360
Is he sleepwalking again?

3099
05:42:01,360 --> 05:42:04,720
All right, i'm gonna go to bed and i'm gonna look at my log and we'll see who's got something to do

3100
05:42:05,360 --> 05:42:14,979
Okay

3101
05:42:14,979 --> 05:42:16,439
Here we go

3102
05:42:16,439 --> 05:42:19,560
Effica wants to disguise herself as chanlo to get his secrets

3103
05:42:20,279 --> 05:42:23,080
This is here. We're out. Well, I think this is the end of her line here

3104
05:42:27,400 --> 05:42:29,400
Wait, you got something else too

3105
05:42:32,369 --> 05:42:36,470
You don't get it pal. It doesn't matter if i'm honest or dishonest

3106
05:42:37,169 --> 05:42:39,169
Either way I lose out in the end

3107
05:42:39,810 --> 05:42:43,729
You think I like being a scumbag a grifter a hustler?

3108
05:42:44,529 --> 05:42:46,529
It's all miserable

3109
05:42:47,799 --> 05:42:53,080
Okay, I think I haven't tried uh, I gave honest living enough chances

3110
05:42:53,639 --> 05:42:57,639
But I wasn't born rich and that means I can't afford to be happy

3111
05:42:58,119 --> 05:43:02,840
So unless you're gonna buy something one downside. Yeah, the one downside somebody said steam users molding

3112
05:43:04,770 --> 05:43:08,930
Yeah, this is like on the epic game store right now. It's just like okay like cool

3113
05:43:09,810 --> 05:43:12,279
It'll be on steam in like six months probably right?

3114
05:43:13,240 --> 05:43:18,759
That's the only downside it's like, all right, you're gonna get another launcher, but that it's a great game

3115
05:43:19,479 --> 05:43:22,439
Doesn't really whatever you have to download like an exe file

3116
05:43:23,080 --> 05:43:32,150
Wambus how you doing? I'm not ready to talk to you yet

3117
05:43:37,680 --> 05:43:39,680
Boy, I was in the middle of your line, too

3118
05:43:40,240 --> 05:43:45,040
I was okay. I was in the middle of her quest line. There's only one more place mentioned in grandma's journal

3119
05:43:45,759 --> 05:44:00,630
One more place. All right, we're about to close out her line for the frosted peak finish the game

3120
05:44:01,270 --> 05:44:07,380
Well, you understand that once I finish the game the stream is over almost caught up to gram a lot of blood

3121
05:44:07,619 --> 05:44:11,970
You know that right about the view from the top means we ought to start climbing

3122
05:44:12,290 --> 05:44:15,889
So all you guys calling for me to end the game. You're actually calling for me to end the stream

3123
05:44:16,369 --> 05:44:25,159
What the heck is going on here?

3124
05:44:25,159 --> 05:44:27,650
That's the point

3125
05:44:27,650 --> 05:44:36,360
Yeah, i'm good. I'm still having fun. Now. Look i'm gonna play my video game. You can play your video game

3126
05:44:37,000 --> 05:44:39,169
And we can I thought she was on crutches for a second

3127
05:44:58,159 --> 05:45:03,650
We gotta let him know to catch the snoopy banoopi here noted i'll get it

3128
05:45:15,860 --> 05:45:21,380
You're really really exhausting this aren't you? Come on. Let's go up the top of the mountain keep going

3129
05:45:22,680 --> 05:45:26,389
All right. We made it. This is it. All right

3130
05:45:27,029 --> 05:45:30,229
This camp had to be one of grandma's and

3131
05:45:34,400 --> 05:45:40,880
It'd be a fitting way to go staring out over the land she loved exploring and what's this snack this is

3132
05:45:40,880 --> 05:45:43,959
Maybe a last meal or

3133
05:45:44,040 --> 05:45:46,680
This is way too happy for what you're looking at right now

3134
05:45:48,659 --> 05:45:54,500
Oh, i'm trying to find my long lost grandma. I wonder what happened to her. Oh, she's dead frozen her skeleton's in an ice cube

3135
05:45:55,220 --> 05:45:59,779
Oh, I wonder what she ate before she died. What even when I was a kid?

3136
05:46:01,459 --> 05:46:06,150
Didn't have too many teeth. This can't be her s

3137
05:46:07,430 --> 05:46:13,830
Unless i'm remembering ron or she got spares. It's been so long. I suppose I can't say

3138
05:46:14,790 --> 05:46:18,150
If I want to be dead sure I need an expert

3139
05:46:19,189 --> 05:46:29,810
So I guess I'll bury your grandmother

3140
05:46:34,610 --> 05:46:44,020
You're a lost explorer from relatively modern times

3141
05:46:44,659 --> 05:46:58,180
You can't die in this game. Don't worry. All right. I need a snoopy banoopi

3142
05:47:00,790 --> 05:47:02,919
Scoopy banoopi

3143
05:47:02,919 --> 05:47:04,919
There's a scoopy banoopi

3144
05:47:08,099 --> 05:47:18,340
We need fire come with me. What does he hate? He loves chocolate. All right, give me the ball chocolate on that ball

3145
05:47:24,020 --> 05:47:38,790

3146
05:47:39,430 --> 05:47:58,229

05:47:58,229 --> 05:48:00,630
You just ruined everything ball. Good knock him off the cliff

3148
05:48:01,349 --> 05:48:04,069
Okay now

3149
05:48:04,069 --> 05:48:05,270
um

3150
05:48:05,270 --> 05:48:06,709
It's a trip him

3151
05:48:06,709 --> 05:48:12,770
What just happened?

3152
05:48:12,770 --> 05:48:14,770
What what what?

3153
05:48:14,770 --> 05:48:32,000
I was about to quit the game

3154
05:48:32,000 --> 05:48:52,439
I don't care. I apologize for dragging you into this mess again

3155
05:48:53,000 --> 05:48:56,700
I'll take care of this issue myself if I want so spindly and reclusive

3156
05:48:57,419 --> 05:48:59,419
I know what you're thinking

3157
05:49:02,299 --> 05:49:09,830
Where am I getting communicated from okay, so

3158
05:49:10,630 --> 05:49:13,659
Why are you calling me dude?

3159
05:49:13,659 --> 05:49:15,900
Why are you leaving voicemails on my video?

3160
05:49:26,630 --> 05:49:31,909
I I did not rage quit bug snack because I was gonna rage quit to the main menu so I could wake up in bug snackville

3161
05:49:41,740 --> 05:49:43,240
Okay

3162
05:49:43,240 --> 05:49:45,369
Becca

3163
05:49:45,369 --> 05:49:47,930
Becca I got here we go

3164
05:49:51,779 --> 05:49:54,310
Effica

3165
05:49:54,310 --> 05:49:59,080
Where are you?

3166
05:49:59,159 --> 05:50:03,159
You're in here. Uh-huh. What's the final? What's the final?

3167
05:50:03,880 --> 05:50:07,720
Part of your quest buried his dirt so deep not even snorpy knows about it

3168
05:50:08,119 --> 05:50:15,990
I've spent my whole career looking into the good ones and finding out who they really are

3169
05:50:16,630 --> 05:50:19,830
And like i'm always the one who suffers for telling the truth

3170
05:50:20,470 --> 05:50:27,509
Every friend I ever had dropped me as soon as I told them something they didn't want died to scoopy panoopy omega low

3171
05:50:28,150 --> 05:50:33,110
The only upside to complete scoopy panoopy. Yeah, I don't care

3172
05:50:37,880 --> 05:50:41,799
I don't know. I like you because we're similar. I'm a leo like that

3173
05:50:42,680 --> 05:50:44,680
Can I really trust you?

3174
05:50:45,319 --> 05:50:47,319
there's plenty of time to find out but

3175
05:50:48,549 --> 05:50:51,270
I'd probably be a lot happier if I didn't know

3176
05:50:53,139 --> 05:50:55,419
Okay

3177
05:50:55,419 --> 05:50:57,900
Okay, I thought it was a gun. I thought I thought it was a gun

3178
05:50:57,979 --> 05:51:01,580
I really did that was a weird way to say the end and that and then like here comes a gum

3179
05:51:01,580 --> 05:51:03,580
Here's a gun. Like I don't know why I thought that was like a gun

3180
05:51:04,380 --> 05:51:15,990
Okay

3181
05:51:16,069 --> 05:51:18,389
God damn it. I'm gonna get the scoopy panoopy right now

3182
05:51:42,650 --> 05:51:47,590
Okay, one scoopy panoopy and then we'll turn that in by that point

3183
05:51:47,669 --> 05:51:53,990
We'll be able to do the final part of becca's quest line and then whatever the end of this one is too

3184
05:51:55,020 --> 05:51:57,020
And then I will do the final party

3185
05:51:57,580 --> 05:52:00,139
Where we invite lizbert to the fire?

3186
05:52:02,200 --> 05:52:07,049
I'll take turns eating pieces of her body. I'm sure that's how it's gonna end

3187
05:52:11,939 --> 05:52:16,180
All right scoopy panoopy round two, let's go. I'm gonna get ready for this

3188
05:52:24,569 --> 05:52:28,330
That's the that's the goal. So we go right here. All right scoopy panoopy

3189
05:52:29,049 --> 05:53:24,060
Where is he? I don't see a scoopy panoopy anywhere reload you hunted them to extinction speed runners of this game

3190
05:53:24,700 --> 05:53:44,740
Must go absolutely nuts when they don't get the spawn of the scoopy panoopy still no scoopy panoopy

3191
05:53:53,099 --> 05:54:02,819
No scoopy panoopies. The hell is that?

3192
05:54:05,020 --> 05:54:12,979
What the hell is that thing?

3193
05:54:12,979 --> 05:54:44,779
What are these things? Wait a minute. I'm gonna free them. I tried there's a stew guy in here

3194
05:54:45,099 --> 05:54:52,840
What if I cut what does the stew guy like? What if I cover? All right, i'm gonna cover the ice and hot sauce

3195
05:54:53,240 --> 05:55:11,639
Go for it

3196
05:55:11,959 --> 05:55:13,959
Um

3197
05:55:15,799 --> 05:55:37,500
I don't know what to do set yourself on fire. Holy shit. It worked. What is this one? There you are

3198
05:55:38,729 --> 05:55:48,090
It's an egg roll. I just rescued you the box protects its body. Perhaps it can be grappled away

3199
05:55:53,909 --> 05:56:01,849
All right easy

3200
05:56:02,729 --> 05:56:05,659

3227
06:01:17,610 --> 06:01:18,729
Mmm

3228
06:01:18,729 --> 06:01:24,810
I'm afraid that our success may provoke a counter-attack from the grumpinati. However, I have defenses prepared

3229
06:01:25,290 --> 06:01:32,889
Oh, well almost prepared. I've set up flares around town. They should ward away any predator snacks looking to take action against us

3230
06:01:33,610 --> 06:01:39,130
Ward away. Okay. I'm so glad you asked. Did you know that my trip shot can do more than well trip?

3231
06:01:39,849 --> 06:01:43,529
It can also spread fire. Wow. I'm so excited for this

3232
06:01:43,689 --> 06:01:48,650
The element of nature if you will scoopy panoopy you should be able to like the rest of my flares

3233

All right, light all the flares

3238
06:03:03,430 --> 06:03:05,990
Bro, I saw snorpy set these up

3239
06:03:06,709 --> 06:03:12,630

3247
06:04:14,330 --> 06:04:16,709
Where are you?

3248
06:04:16,709 --> 06:04:21,000
Up top. Okay. Give me that

3249
06:04:26,889 --> 06:04:31,110
Get out of the house

3250
06:04:31,430 --> 06:04:35,029
We're good

3251
06:04:35,029 --> 06:04:37,270
The dude just runs in screaming on fire

3252
06:04:38,549 --> 06:04:42,069
That would not be cool. Okay six. Where's the last one?

3253
06:04:44,919 --> 06:04:49,349
Where's the last fire?

3254
06:04:49,349 --> 06:04:57,930
Can we see him?

3255
06:04:58,810 --> 06:05:13,130
Why in the garden? Oh, it is right there. You're right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

3256
06:05:24,740 --> 06:05:28,970
Do you run faster? I feel like you do

3257
06:05:29,689 --> 06:05:36,119
We're protected for the time being yes, he does that sometimes he's adorably inquisitive

3258
06:05:36,759 --> 06:05:41,319
You let me worry about that. I'm very used to worrying for now ease your mind

3259
06:05:41,319 --> 06:05:43,319
I think it actually is like five to ten percent faster

3260
06:05:46,900 --> 06:05:48,020
Okay

3261
06:05:48,020 --> 06:05:53,299
Here we go. I'm afraid we went up to the wrong target. The mountain is now more active than ever

3262
06:05:53,779 --> 06:05:57,540
But the good news is i've isolated the source of this seismic activity

3263
06:05:58,180 --> 06:06:01,459
The bad news is it's on the frosted peak. This is another boss

3264
06:06:02,740 --> 06:06:06,979
What it might be this is definitely another boss on your toes chum. This one could get messy

3265
06:06:09,110 --> 06:06:10,790
Cake boss it

3266
06:06:10,790 --> 06:06:15,979
I'm sorry. I didn't know that was gonna work

3267
06:06:18,490 --> 06:06:27,450
All right frosted peak. Let's do it. It's gonna be a big cake. I'm actually looking forward to this

3268
06:06:35,700 --> 06:06:38,340
After this, we're gonna see what if becca has anything to finish

3269
06:06:39,139 --> 06:06:41,139
And then i'm gonna do the final celebration

3270
06:06:56,150 --> 06:07:03,830
Oh, no 100 I gotta get some food and I gotta get up to i'm breaking my rule

3271
06:07:05,939 --> 06:07:08,419
The four to six hour stream rule has been broken

3272
06:07:09,139 --> 06:07:10,919
so

3273
06:07:10,919 --> 06:07:13,479
God, I have to get up soon

3274
06:07:21,590 --> 06:07:23,590
You're stronger now

3275
06:07:25,110 --> 06:07:30,139
Not so sure about that catch one daddy cake legs

3276
06:07:41,799 --> 06:07:45,400
In here here. We are the source of the seismic readings

3277
06:07:48,680 --> 06:07:50,680
Daddy cake

3278
06:07:53,959 --> 06:07:58,680
It's a birthday cake, this is a birthday candle. All right, that's what this was. I was wondering what the mound was for

3279
06:07:59,479 --> 06:08:04,729
Happy birthday

3280
06:08:07,720 --> 06:08:09,720
Holy shit, okay scan it

3281
06:08:10,650 --> 06:08:12,090
this behemoth

3282
06:08:12,090 --> 06:08:16,889
Doesn't like having its candles lit a flaming trick shot. All right doesn't like having the candles lit

3283
06:08:17,450 --> 06:08:23,400
You don't like to have the candles lit

3284
06:08:24,040 --> 06:08:30,229
How did you miss that? I don't I didn't even aim that way

3285
06:08:38,779 --> 06:08:55,020
Walk over here. Oh, come on. There it is

3286
06:08:55,819 --> 06:08:57,819
I didn't light a candle

3287
06:09:08,680 --> 06:09:10,680
Okay work, all right got one

3288
06:09:10,840 --> 06:09:21,180
Get the other one

3289
06:09:21,180 --> 06:09:23,979
Why would you do that? So anyway, I wouldn't even aim it over there

3290
06:09:28,330 --> 06:09:30,520
Say what?

3291
06:09:30,520 --> 06:09:35,080
That's not just a giant enemy cake. It's not an enemy spider. It's a giant enemy cake

3292
06:09:44,229 --> 06:09:46,229
So, all right giant enemy

3293
06:09:47,380 --> 06:09:53,860
cake

3294
06:09:53,860 --> 06:09:55,860
Did I light the other candle?

3295
06:10:03,860 --> 06:10:05,860
What the hell just came out of him

3296
06:10:08,979 --> 06:10:13,860
Well, not to worry according to my readings it's still around here somewhere what about those

3297
06:10:14,180 --> 06:10:16,939
Find it and finish the job

3298
06:10:17,099 --> 06:10:19,099
Do you forget about these things?

3299
06:10:29,189 --> 06:10:31,110
baby cake legs

3300
06:10:31,110 --> 06:10:37,529
Recently cut from the cake. They seem to be seeking their master. Oh, I think we just well we follow them

3301
06:10:48,060 --> 06:10:55,880
Let's off lock it get off of that

3302
06:11:04,540 --> 06:11:08,310
He's not following me

3303
06:11:10,389 --> 06:11:21,110
I didn't mean to oh I missed a shot over I missed

3304
06:11:23,159 --> 06:11:25,159
I missed a shot over

3305
06:11:25,319 --> 06:11:33,049
They're not on fire. Why is it on?

3306
06:11:34,020 --> 06:11:39,720
Why is it not on fire?

3307
06:11:45,900 --> 06:11:48,459

He went far

3312
06:12:24,360 --> 06:12:40,299
I feel like i'm supposed to be doing this

3313
06:12:40,299 --> 06:12:44,650
Because he's breaking up into little pieces, right?

3314
06:13:01,619 --> 06:13:12,709
Go on kids. There's the fire. Ah right here

06:13:34,819 --> 06:13:36,659
What a shot

3318
06:13:36,659 --> 06:13:38,819
Oh, what a shot that was

3319
06:13:51,349 --> 06:13:53,349
I want to pick up these guys. I think

3320
06:13:57,430 --> 06:14:01,259
He's on fire though. I can't touch him. All right, stop being on fire now

3321
06:14:03,240 --> 06:14:05,240
Oh, well, then just do this

3322
06:14:10,889 --> 06:14:12,729
Stop being on fire

3323
06:14:12,729 --> 06:14:22,229
Oh, okay. All right. Where is he? He didn't follow me around. He was stuck on the mountain

3324
06:14:22,709 --> 06:14:34,680
Where did where is where'd he go? He's back in town. What about the trap, but they're on fire

3325
06:14:40,279 --> 06:14:44,759
I can't get them to not be on fire

3326
06:14:45,639 --> 06:15:30,970
Let's go. Whoa

3327
06:15:30,970 --> 06:15:44,759
Where is he? Did he actually get glitched and stuck on the side of the mountain?

3328
06:16:03,770 --> 06:16:12,180
There he is

3329
06:16:12,180 --> 06:16:26,459
Here eat this. I'm sure you'll love it. Wait, try this one first. That's of just an upgraded marshmallow nose

3330
06:16:33,259 --> 06:16:41,020
All right, very cool. All right, let's

3331
06:16:41,659 --> 06:16:46,139
Finish the game. Let's finish it. I did a lot of fun stuff

3332
06:16:48,180 --> 06:16:51,380
If becca does not have a complete my quest thing immediately

3333
06:16:52,020 --> 06:17:09,700
And i'm gonna do the final celebration. That's it finish the quest line. I will all right

3334
06:17:09,700 --> 06:17:12,419
I'm about to give my no. No, i'm not. I haven't finished yet

3335
06:17:13,689 --> 06:17:22,630
I haven't finished yet

3336
06:17:22,630 --> 06:17:28,069
I was supposed to give the final rating but I want to see how the game ends. The ending has a very very very very big

3337
06:17:28,790 --> 06:17:35,060
influence on how I feel

3338
06:17:46,659 --> 06:17:54,139
I'm done playing games dog that died up there and then what would I do? Huh? I'm sorry chandlo

3339
06:17:54,779 --> 06:17:56,779
That was not cool

3340
06:17:56,939 --> 06:18:01,909
Just gotta chill out go chill figure out when you're ready to talk to me

3341
06:18:03,639 --> 06:18:08,759
All right. Now everybody just stop it. No, he hates being in the dark and I hate leaving him there

3342
06:18:09,240 --> 06:18:15,159
I want to tell him but you also kept the whole birthday cake for yourself, which that's all kind of a dick move already

3343
06:18:18,650 --> 06:18:20,970
And i'm the one that did all the work and you didn't even share it with me

3344
06:18:22,009 --> 06:18:28,380
I don't think you'll believe me. But now it seems like I might lose him who eats their entire birthday cake by themselves

3345
06:18:29,830 --> 06:18:41,500
A monster that's who? All right. Where's becca? She's sleeping

3346
06:18:45,060 --> 06:18:48,250
Wake up. I keep forgetting. She looks like this

3347
06:19:01,299 --> 06:19:03,590
Hey, all right. Do you want to talk?

3348
06:19:03,590 --> 06:19:14,919
No, no, I gotta go to the bathroom first

3349
06:19:15,959 --> 06:19:18,439
All right. Do you have nothing else for me? Let's see. Do you?

3350
06:19:23,270 --> 06:19:25,900
No, I think that's it

3351
06:19:28,069 --> 06:19:29,270
That's it

3352
06:19:29,270 --> 06:19:33,380

3384
06:22:39,290 --> 06:22:41,290
It felt like 24

3385
06:22:44,490 --> 06:22:49,950
You're saying I should chug this snack water upside down

Listen philbo. I appreciate what you're doing like getting everybody here. It's way less boring now

06:23:17,799 --> 06:23:22,279
Actually still pretty boring though friends. They're just making nice because it's better than being alone

3390
06:23:22,939 --> 06:23:24,939
Sure, but who wants to be alone?

3391
06:23:25,580 --> 06:23:27,580
Pickle beth

06:23:28,139 --> 06:23:33,419
But like in a good way, oh they're gonna they're gonna like each other it's gonna be so cute

3397
06:24:13,369 --> 06:24:19,049
Go dance, maybe later, bro. I'm busy soaking up shelter's wisdom

3398
06:24:20,470 --> 06:24:23,909
Um, oh dance

3399
06:24:23,909 --> 06:24:28,470

3400
06:24:29,349 --> 06:24:33,209
So this must be before one dances

3401
06:24:35,319 --> 06:24:39,400
Get over there and dance

3402
06:24:39,400 --> 06:24:45,560
There's a party in my mouth and i'm invited. Don't ever say that out loud again osteoblast says

Wouldn't you rather hear about the captivating history of dance?

3406

Yes, tell me didn't expect that did you tell me everything back in like the fucking incan times back when they were

Better than the last one. That's for sure

3409
06:25:35,639 --> 06:25:38,759
And i'm thinking I should apologize to grumble first

3410
06:25:40,200 --> 06:25:42,200
Can't muster up the words

3411
06:25:43,209 --> 06:25:45,209
Maybe I could use some of that there

3412
06:25:45,369 --> 06:25:54,840
You want booze? How do I get anybody to dance? Okay, how do I turn on change the song?

3413
06:26:00,650 --> 06:26:05,189
I get them to do anything. He's kind of nice. Even the ones are I have to go give him alcohol

3414
06:26:09,509 --> 06:26:11,509
Now let's work pass out the alcohol

3415
06:26:13,830 --> 06:26:19,430
Wait, all right. I give you the bug juice. I'm gonna give it to him. All right. Here you go. Look at this

3416
06:26:19,830 --> 06:26:31,110
All right, it's that easy man much obliged stranger. I better talk to grumble before I lose my nerve

3417
06:26:40,680 --> 06:26:48,650
Grumble i'm sorry. Is this wait he walks up punches him in the face even worse to your little ones. You're serious

3418
06:26:49,130 --> 06:26:53,290
No fooling. I don't tell jokes. Grimble. I am not

3419
06:26:53,849 --> 06:26:56,680
creative

3420
06:26:56,680 --> 06:27:01,819
Apology accepted now dance, of course. No forgiving is complete. She always is dancing

3421
06:27:01,900 --> 06:27:11,779
So that's what one out of 11 is right? I suppose the dance couldn't join them. What a fabulous party

3422
06:27:12,020 --> 06:27:18,380
It's no grumble palooza, but we may do let's go darling. I'm always dancing

3423
06:27:19,020 --> 06:27:26,139
I'd love to storm the dance floor, but I prefer to sing along and tragically my vocal chords are fried

3424
06:27:27,689 --> 06:27:38,619
Booze you got it

3425
06:27:38,619 --> 06:27:41,819
Beverage service now I can sing the night away

3426
06:27:43,319 --> 06:27:44,200
Good

3427
06:27:44,200 --> 06:27:48,540
What about you? Why don't you go over there? All right, what about you two?

3428
06:27:51,099 --> 06:27:54,599
Insults were just get them all drunk

3429
06:27:55,560 --> 06:27:58,520
they'll finally dance in capturing research samples and I

3430
06:27:59,319 --> 06:28:01,319
appreciate that about you

3431
06:28:01,720 --> 06:28:08,299
Your apology is as lacking as your ethical standards, but it's a start excellent now that we are reconciled

3432
06:28:08,299 --> 06:28:13,580
I have a dozen research papers that could use peer review as you seem to have free time right now

3433
06:28:13,659 --> 06:28:15,259
Let us begin

3434
06:28:15,259 --> 06:28:19,990
And I take it all back booze

3435
06:28:23,139 --> 06:28:27,189
Here give that back if you don't want it

3436
06:28:29,419 --> 06:28:36,840
All right, I'll take it you don't want it

3437
06:28:41,860 --> 06:28:43,860
What I cracked like the egg above

3438
06:28:53,020 --> 06:28:54,840
All right, that worked

3439
06:28:54,840 --> 06:28:59,080
Uh, what about you here? How do I get you over there?

3440
06:29:00,279 --> 06:29:06,119
I'm gonna show them what a real party looks like get over there. All right, only a few more. What about you here?

3441
06:29:06,919 --> 06:29:09,159
Somebody take this man. Somebody drink it

3442
06:29:09,479 --> 06:29:32,790
Ttd without snorpy flaming drink bro drink it. I can't burn. Ah soft lock burn

3443
06:29:36,919 --> 06:29:47,220
Now it's time. Oh have fun. Look at them all enjoying themselves. I did this. This is my doing i'm god here

3444
06:29:49,240 --> 06:29:51,240
I created the fun

3445
06:29:51,720 --> 06:29:55,080
The party lights double as a wave inhibitor. This party is secure

3446
06:29:55,240 --> 06:30:01,580
I have something important to ask chandler, but being sibling of mine won't leave me be

3447
06:30:03,909 --> 06:30:11,029
You're interrupting personal business unless you have something intelligent to say be gone rhythmic gyration has no purpose

3448
06:30:14,099 --> 06:30:23,029
Can you leave the party then leave the fucking party turn it up. What about tiffany?

3449
06:30:23,669 --> 06:30:26,680
Go dance with you. Just go talk to lou

3450
06:30:27,080 --> 06:30:33,369
I bet floofy will want to learn the desert empire's dance of certain death. He's doing gangnam style

3451
06:30:35,380 --> 06:30:37,479
He is

3452
06:30:37,479 --> 06:30:39,479
He actually is doing god himself

3453
06:30:41,209 --> 06:30:44,409
Okay, now we can have you leave so this is perfect

3454
06:30:44,409 --> 06:30:49,930
The desert dance mirrors the moves for hand-to-hand combat against bug snacks

3455
06:30:50,490 --> 06:30:53,209
Thus the youth were tricked into learning

3456
06:30:53,750 --> 06:30:59,540
Fascinating hiding purpose and frivolous waste. Oh, you believe it when she says it

3457
06:31:00,020 --> 06:31:06,990
Trippany has convinced me of the historic and cultural value of expressive movement. Perhaps I should experiment

3458
06:31:08,490 --> 06:31:14,330
Oh go go go makes me want to shake my tailbone. My chance has arrived. Don't blow it fizzle bean

3459
06:31:15,130 --> 06:31:20,150
Go go go go go go go go

3460
06:31:22,790 --> 06:31:29,610
Chandlo, I I we've been together for so long and i've always wondered how you feel about me

3461
06:31:31,349 --> 06:31:33,349
Do you want to be my boyfriend?

3462
06:31:34,150 --> 06:31:37,340
What bro that doesn't make any sense?

3463
06:31:38,220 --> 06:31:39,180
Oh

3464
06:31:39,180 --> 06:31:40,709
I see

3465
06:31:40,709 --> 06:31:42,229
Wait, what?

3466
06:31:42,229 --> 06:31:43,909
Forget what I said

3467
06:31:43,909 --> 06:31:46,709
Snorpy we've been dating for years

3468
06:31:47,669 --> 06:31:49,110
Wait, what?

3469
06:31:49,110 --> 06:31:51,110
How is that possible?

3470
06:31:52,310 --> 06:31:57,590
Remember that time we made out on that ferris wheel and I said you don't even know that you're like dating this guy

3471
06:31:57,909 --> 06:32:03,869
Well, yes, I just thought that we were roommates with benefits. You know, I hate ambiguity

3472
06:32:04,740 --> 06:32:10,360
Sorry snorp dog. Is that clear enough for you?

3473
06:32:14,229 --> 06:32:19,590
I love you dog now. Let's dance get over there get over there you two

3474
06:32:23,029 --> 06:32:24,630
Hey

3475
06:32:24,630 --> 06:32:28,869
Forget about hey, what was that lady's name that fucking disappeared and died or something?

3476
06:32:30,150 --> 06:32:32,500
Yeah, fucker. Who cares?

3477
06:32:32,500 --> 06:32:33,779
Let's go

3478
06:32:33,779 --> 06:32:50,630
smile

3479
06:32:50,630 --> 06:32:55,990
Oh, look at that. Just absolutely destroying it. I you i'm gonna talk to the mayor

3480
06:33:01,669 --> 06:33:09,860
Bilbo we did it. We did it. We did it buddy. We did we're all together again

3481
06:33:10,419 --> 06:33:17,299
Oh, well almost all of us. You know, what are you doing up here?

3482
06:33:17,540 --> 06:33:19,540
Is out there gives me hope that Liz

3483
06:33:20,580 --> 06:33:25,450
I mean none of this would have been possible without you buddy. It's like a dog waiting for a treat

3484
06:33:25,450 --> 06:33:30,020
Back for your job eventually, but I'd sure miss you if you left

3485
06:33:30,759 --> 06:33:36,439
And did she say something or is he still need to interview lisper, right? So our end is nigh

3486
06:33:36,520 --> 06:33:38,520
She was just getting in place for her queue

3487
06:33:38,840 --> 06:33:39,880
and

3488
06:33:39,880 --> 06:33:52,889
Well, is that a is this the dark twist that everyone was talking about?

3489
06:33:57,419 --> 06:34:00,889
I know this looks bad. But as long as we keep calm

3490
06:34:07,380 --> 06:34:12,299
Children, it's the queen of bug queen of bug snacks

3491
06:34:17,779 --> 06:34:24,119
Machinations are coming to fruition now. Hold on. We're not gonna die because of some cult or monster

3492
06:34:24,759 --> 06:34:27,240
That's right. Bigger out what to do now

3493
06:34:28,759 --> 06:34:32,680
The volcano that's right. Wait, what? Oh bad timing

3494
06:34:33,080 --> 06:34:37,240
Suppose we're gonna end up buried like all the others. Hey, come on death wing

3495
06:34:37,880 --> 06:34:46,040
We can survive this as long as we got bugs next we'll be fine my barn collapsed all of my little ones

3496
06:34:48,950 --> 06:34:50,950
That was a lot of work for nothing

3497
06:35:01,060 --> 06:35:20,860
This funny nose, I can't take it seriously, this is a very dire horrible situation. Wait, where did you come from?

3498
06:35:30,360 --> 06:35:34,279
Hey everybody chanlo floofy mr. Trouble ham

3499
06:35:34,919 --> 06:35:41,509
Doc glad you made it. Does that mean you figured it out? That's right. Philbo. I know how to get to liz

3501
06:35:48,970 --> 06:35:56,029
Stop making me laugh. This is scary chance. We get liz is in danger. This disaster is only getting started

3502
06:36:03,509 --> 06:36:05,509
Ending quiet you

3503
06:36:06,549 --> 06:36:09,189
Doctor you are only subjecting yourself to needless risk

3504
06:36:09,750 --> 06:36:13,669
Elizabeth is likely deceased dog. This bird is alive

3505
06:36:14,389 --> 06:36:16,389
And we're not gonna leave her behind

3506
06:36:17,029 --> 06:36:19,029
I just need philbo and

3507
06:36:19,270 --> 06:36:24,729
This game is fucking ridiculous. I can't even what the hell is happening right now

3508
06:36:29,860 --> 06:36:32,819
I we need right now. I this is fucked up

3509
06:36:33,619 --> 06:36:39,860
This is this is people that have foods for their body parts talking about like a terrible situation, but look at them

3510
06:36:44,139 --> 06:36:47,540
But what do we do when the queen comes to devour us

3511
06:36:48,180 --> 06:36:49,619
Well, I have a few

3512
06:36:49,619 --> 06:36:51,619
Prototype traps that I could put to use

3513
06:36:52,180 --> 06:36:57,689
And more practical threats, you know the earthquakes the volcanoes and what have you

3514
06:36:57,770 --> 06:37:01,610
It's got a spy kids vibe find a way to get off the ground if the need arises

3515
06:37:02,090 --> 06:37:06,090
Well, none of that matters if I starve to death we got my sauce

3516
06:37:06,810 --> 06:37:10,569
Yeah, no way pal. I ain't gonna chat out of that nasty plant goop

3517
06:37:13,319 --> 06:37:18,939
I stand corrected no more concerns. Great. Let's get to it then

3518
06:37:21,799 --> 06:37:24,759
Where are we going open the mysterious mountain door?

3519
06:37:29,139 --> 06:37:32,180
Uh, guess we're going. Why is everybody else not coming with us?

3520
06:37:33,220 --> 06:37:35,220
guys, uh, when did it become

3521
06:37:35,939 --> 06:37:41,060
God damn it this everybody agreed to do something and the three of us are the only ones that decided to do it

3522
06:37:51,500 --> 06:37:58,470
Team project. Yeah

3523
06:38:05,430 --> 06:38:08,169
He didn't listen to a single thing I was I was the cameraman

3524
06:38:12,119 --> 06:38:14,279
I had to concentrate on who was talking not on what they were saying

3525
06:38:49,669 --> 06:38:56,279
What if there was a burger inside monka s that's my favorite comment so far what if there was a burger inside

3526
06:38:57,479 --> 06:38:59,479
I don't know. What if there was a burger in there?

3527
06:39:04,729 --> 06:39:12,729
Do you need a break? Let me check your vitals. Oh, i'm okay besides we're we're almost there

3528
06:39:14,970 --> 06:39:16,259
Right

3529
06:39:16,259 --> 06:39:21,540
But in the future you could stand to do some exercise or just hang out with chamelo

3530
06:39:22,340 --> 06:39:24,900
I'm gonna play nascar with this motherfucker and get it around

3531
06:39:27,159 --> 06:39:32,119
Don't do it. I can't have to I have to do it. I have to do it. I have to I have to do it

3532
06:39:32,840 --> 06:39:42,680
It doesn't work. Anyways, we're here

3533
06:39:46,650 --> 06:39:48,650
Turns out she wrote the order backwards

3534
06:39:48,889 --> 06:39:52,330
I guess even the great elizabeth megafit can still make mistakes

3535
06:39:53,959 --> 06:39:55,959
Oh, but he's nerfed, right?

3536
06:39:57,319 --> 06:39:59,319
Okay, i'm ready when you are

3537
06:40:01,380 --> 06:40:03,380
Wait, I stepped on it too early

3538
06:40:09,000 --> 06:40:11,000
Here we go the big reveal

3539
06:40:15,400 --> 06:40:17,400
Ah

3540
06:40:17,400 --> 06:40:25,540
It was a trap

3541
06:40:25,540 --> 06:40:27,540
the under snacks

3542
06:40:27,860 --> 06:40:35,099
Where'd everybody go?

3543
06:40:35,099 --> 06:41:00,069
What the hell was that?

3544
06:41:00,069 --> 06:41:06,040
Elbow i'm coming just stay I did see that thing. Remember I didn't I

3545
06:41:07,619 --> 06:41:11,060
That thing appeared like four hours ago and I never took a photo of it

3546
06:41:17,000 --> 06:41:27,770
You found me pretty quick. I'm sure she's not far. I'm ready with the camera next time

3547
06:41:34,470 --> 06:41:44,500
We did

3548
06:41:44,500 --> 06:41:54,520
Jelly river carrot i'll take it. Oh shit. Wait

3549
06:41:57,139 --> 06:41:59,819

3550
06:41:59,819 --> 06:42:05,529
snack swatch

3551
06:42:05,529 --> 06:42:07,529
What the hell is this?

3552
06:42:07,610 --> 06:42:09,930
You've become wait, wait, wait

3553
06:42:15,639 --> 06:42:17,639
What is this like the council of foods?

3554
06:42:28,680 --> 06:42:36,779
Excuse me

3555
06:42:36,779 --> 06:42:39,099
She's the whole she's the pizza cake monster thing

3556
06:42:42,169 --> 06:42:44,169
Oh my what the fuck

Aren't you but we're out of time you have to get out of here

3558
06:42:54,169 --> 06:42:56,729
You have to gather up the others and get off the island

3559
06:42:58,040 --> 06:43:00,040
Okay, then we can talk on the way back

3560
06:43:00,599 --> 06:43:04,060
No filbo I can't go with you like this

3561
06:43:06,680 --> 06:43:08,490
Bilbo

3562
06:43:08,490 --> 06:43:14,360
Are you not understand like to have you this doesn't not freaking out at all filbo. She's embedded inside of this

3563
06:43:15,659 --> 06:43:18,779
Fucking trunk that's put into the cake. That's put into the pizza

3564
06:43:18,779 --> 06:43:21,180
That's put into the frog in the bog in the bog in the lake in the bottom of the sea

3565
06:43:21,659 --> 06:43:25,180
Are you seriously trying to interview me right now?

3566
06:43:27,799 --> 06:43:30,900
Kind of

3567
06:43:30,979 --> 06:43:35,880

Keep it quick

3570
06:43:40,580 --> 06:43:42,900
First of all, what is this this?

3571
06:43:43,860 --> 06:43:51,880
This is the island's true form. It's bug snacks all the way down. That's kind of amazing

3572
06:43:52,840 --> 06:43:57,560
It's disgusting once you understand what bugs snacks. Oh, no, what are they?

3573
06:43:58,680 --> 06:44:02,840
What is a bug snack? Here it comes. It's like the soul of a deceased

3574
06:44:03,560 --> 06:44:05,560
Child in another reality

3575
06:44:06,060 --> 06:44:26,020
They're parasites. Oh never mind inside you they make you want them and before you know it you become it's not that simple

3576
06:44:27,000 --> 06:44:28,180
They're

3577
06:44:28,180 --> 06:44:29,619
insidious

3578
06:44:29,619 --> 06:44:34,119
Patient so they're they're not cute and cuddly and they'll exploit it

3579
06:44:35,130 --> 06:44:39,290
What you see parasites? This is what's left of everybody who came before us

3580
06:44:39,849 --> 06:44:42,970
Of every living thing that wasn't bug snacks

3581
06:44:43,610 --> 06:44:45,610
They always win

3582
06:44:46,650 --> 06:44:51,689
Well, why are you like this after I saved eggabelle I fell into this place

3583
06:44:52,330 --> 06:44:54,650
Before I knew what was happening. I was swarmed

3584
06:44:55,209 --> 06:44:57,450
Bug snacks were crawling down my throat

3585
06:44:58,250 --> 06:45:02,009
They tried to erase me to make me into them

3586
06:45:02,810 --> 06:45:04,330
that's

3587
06:45:04,330 --> 06:45:06,330
Look at how cute they are

3588
06:45:07,380 --> 06:45:11,939
But somehow I pushed back I made them into me

3589
06:45:15,060 --> 06:45:18,419
So that bug snack golem monster is you that's right

3590
06:45:19,299 --> 06:45:23,939
I'm, sorry if I scared you. I just wanted to make everyone leave this awful place

3591
06:45:25,060 --> 06:45:27,060
I can't make bug snacks talk

3592
06:45:27,779 --> 06:45:37,830
So the bug snacks are under control the bug snacks are in. Why did your nose change? They have been since we came here

3593
06:45:38,889 --> 06:45:41,930
They're so ravenous that they're shaking the ground apart

3594
06:45:42,569 --> 06:45:46,409
I'm the only thing keeping this island together right now. It actually is the lich king

3595
06:45:46,409 --> 06:45:49,369
But it's like fighting a tsunami with a bucket

3596
06:45:49,930 --> 06:45:52,650
Didn't we wait didn't we make that reference in that joke?

3597
06:45:53,209 --> 06:45:54,250
like

3598
06:45:54,250 --> 06:46:01,299
Yesterday afternoon that's actually what is going on there

3599
06:46:02,020 --> 06:46:09,110
You have your eyes. It must always be a bug snacks queen. I'm sorry that I put you through so much to get it

3600
06:46:13,029 --> 06:46:14,919
Oh

3601
06:46:14,919 --> 06:46:16,919
I can't hold them back for much longer

3602
06:46:17,639 --> 06:46:19,639
Please go and warn the others

3603
06:46:20,200 --> 06:46:22,090
Wait

3604
06:46:22,090 --> 06:46:26,009
Okay, i'm just if you're really not coming. All right, hold on. I gotta tell you

3605
06:46:26,569 --> 06:46:28,569
What am I supposed to do without you?

3606
06:46:28,650 --> 06:46:34,419
What do you mean the price of the game rating is fine with it going up until about a matter of time before one minute

3607
06:46:34,419 --> 06:46:40,630
Ago up and ruin everything it's stuff. It hates me, but you

3608
06:46:41,430 --> 06:46:43,400
Of you lizbert

3609
06:46:43,400 --> 06:46:44,279
Huh?

3610
06:46:44,279 --> 06:46:49,639
They love the idea of me the idea of me. I'm sorry. I put so much on your shoulders bilbo

3611
06:46:50,279 --> 06:46:53,240
But you you were the one who can bring them together

3612
06:46:54,040 --> 06:46:55,400
me

3613
06:46:55,400 --> 06:46:59,939
Well, i'm the one who made it all fall apart. What are you saying?

3614
06:47:01,220 --> 06:47:08,979
I led you to this terrible island. I filled your bodies with parasites. What I ignored all the warning signs

3615
06:47:10,419 --> 06:47:13,139
I didn't understand what any of you really needed

3616
06:47:13,860 --> 06:47:16,580
So now i'm taking responsibility for my mistakes

3617
06:47:17,540 --> 06:47:20,659
I'll keep the bug snacks at bay long enough for everyone to escape

3618
06:47:21,380 --> 06:47:26,040
Is no no must be some other way we can help you

3619
06:47:26,680 --> 06:47:33,240
No, I should be the only one to suffer the consequences of my actions. Nobody else needs to get hurt because of me

3620
06:47:34,599 --> 06:47:41,770
I've heard that before don't eat those don't touch those

3621
06:47:43,060 --> 06:47:45,380
You shouldn't be here. You need to get away

3622
06:47:48,869 --> 06:47:50,869
Start eating her. Let's go get up

3623
06:47:53,130 --> 06:47:57,689
Agabel stop it. Okay, I could burn her. I got I got a torch back here that I could connect to

3624
06:47:58,569 --> 06:48:02,900
Just so you could play martyr. We're getting out of here together

3625
06:48:03,700 --> 06:48:04,819
I

3626
06:48:04,819 --> 06:48:08,180
I can't my control is already slipping

3627
06:48:08,900 --> 06:48:16,340
If I step outside this cave my connection to the bugs actually is and the island will collapse before I make it another step

3628
06:48:16,900 --> 06:48:21,209
Huh? All right, then i'll get in there with you. I can't believe that

3629
06:48:21,930 --> 06:48:23,529
move over

3630
06:48:23,529 --> 06:48:27,430
It's not a car bell

3631
06:48:27,669 --> 06:48:30,200
What is going on?

3632
06:48:30,200 --> 06:48:36,040
What the fuck is going on? Oh, the price is falling the price isn't a free fall. It's crashing

3633
06:48:37,689 --> 06:48:42,040
The price is crashing right now

3634
06:48:42,119 --> 06:48:47,599
A lot of people are starting to sell as of right now. I didn't I just got conjunctivitis

3635
06:48:47,900 --> 06:48:55,450
At least the eye patch looks cool does make you look a bit worse

3636
06:48:56,250 --> 06:48:59,959
So before the island explodes

3637
06:49:00,439 --> 06:49:01,799
Oh

3638
06:49:01,799 --> 06:49:04,060
I don't know my investment

3639
06:49:06,680 --> 06:49:11,880
I bought in when it was a hundred dollars. I bought it when it was 84 rating a share

3640
06:49:13,209 --> 06:49:16,330
What is it now? I don't even want to look at it. We've been through worse than this

3641
06:49:17,900 --> 06:49:20,459
We both survived so much by ourselves

3642
06:49:21,340 --> 06:49:23,580
Imagine what we can do and we're together

3643
06:49:24,299 --> 06:49:25,340
Okay

3644
06:49:25,340 --> 06:49:28,540
Good luck and i'll see you again someday

3645
06:49:33,419 --> 06:49:35,419
You're going to have to take a bit of a shortcut

3646
06:49:35,979 --> 06:49:41,639
Hold on. I thought that just said learn the tutorial. I don't know why

3647
06:49:44,659 --> 06:49:56,580
Oh, uh, we gotta get out of here. We're gonna warn everybody

3648
06:50:00,700 --> 06:50:02,939
You're on your own, dude. You heard what they said

3649
06:50:19,000 --> 06:50:21,000
Back to the beginning

3650
06:50:21,880 --> 06:50:25,580
It's the beginning

3651
06:50:25,580 --> 06:50:32,459
But no, it's not

3652
06:50:32,459 --> 06:50:33,819
Put it down

3653
06:50:33,819 --> 06:50:37,419
Put down the bug snacks. You don't understand. It's people

3654
06:50:39,590 --> 06:50:41,590
It's made out of people

3655
06:50:43,159 --> 06:50:48,630
Stop eating it. Can we get back to snagsburg as fast as we can?

3656
06:50:49,110 --> 06:50:54,549
We can't let the others eat any more bug snacks if they transform all the way then don't eat the bunker

3657
06:50:55,669 --> 06:51:01,580
We feed them so resistant until we're all out of here

3658
06:51:02,299 --> 06:51:09,900
I can't believe you just streamed a pump and dump scheme

3659
06:51:23,419 --> 06:51:25,419
Escape from stack tooth quick. Let's go

3660
06:51:28,229 --> 06:51:31,110
There they are rump's name. Have you two been

3661
06:51:31,590 --> 06:51:38,169
I'll explain later the bug snacks are coming to wipe us out off this island now. I suspect it as much

3662
06:51:38,650 --> 06:51:41,049
Luckily, the balloon is almost ready to take flight

3663
06:51:41,529 --> 06:51:46,250
Great, but where is everybody dead all dead all of them?

3664
06:51:53,459 --> 06:51:55,459
Only buy us time

3665
06:51:56,180 --> 06:52:01,159
I need you here

3666
06:52:01,159 --> 06:52:06,200
Hold steady my love get the minigun. Oh, but somebody needs to finish fueling the balloon

3667
06:52:06,759 --> 06:52:09,959
Don't worry snorty. Leave the balloon to me go and help chandler

3668
06:52:10,659 --> 06:52:13,880
Splendid as for you. You may need my snack chop

3669
06:52:14,119 --> 06:52:22,729
It's much like the snack trap if it were set to uh-huh puree good luck, okay

3670
06:52:23,290 --> 06:52:32,790
This looks simple enough. This is get the is a nuke

3671
06:52:44,970 --> 06:52:49,270
bend

3672
06:52:49,270 --> 06:52:56,569
defend filbo

3673
06:52:56,729 --> 06:53:01,689
Okay, so they're oh they're they're evil bugs. They're parasites and they're gonna kill us

3674
06:53:05,819 --> 06:53:09,340
I like the better one. We were just dancing around a campfire looking around for the lady that was lost

3675
06:53:16,060 --> 06:53:24,299
Help sheldon and flutie

3676
06:53:27,430 --> 06:53:29,430
But they were so cute though

3677
06:53:29,509 --> 06:53:35,830
One has foreseen the bug snacks will be five feet to the right of where you're aiming

3678
06:53:36,630 --> 06:53:42,549
I'm a scientist not an exterminator. Remember when you force fed the sleepwalking guy parasites against his will

3679
06:53:43,029 --> 06:53:45,770
Well, first of all, I didn't know

3680
06:53:45,770 --> 06:53:48,409
That he was sleepwalking and second of all, I didn't know they were parasites

3681
06:53:49,130 --> 06:53:55,639
Come someone with a healthy capacity for violence take this device and clear a path for us, please

3682
06:53:56,599 --> 06:54:04,150
go

3683
06:54:04,150 --> 06:54:09,509
This just became a dude another so there really is the dark twist you guys weren't fucking around

3684
06:54:17,479 --> 06:54:20,259
You weren't supposed to eat that

3685
06:54:20,259 --> 06:54:26,220
You weren't supposed to eat that

3686
06:54:26,619 --> 06:54:29,419
Bad ending she ate one. She's gonna turn

3687
06:54:45,259 --> 06:54:47,259
Doesn't even hurt see you're fine

3688
06:54:52,020 --> 06:54:54,020
Everyone seems to be fine

3689
06:54:55,139 --> 06:55:02,180
Dude, okay, you wouldn't drink like four bottles of vodka in one sitting. So don't eat like four cases of bug snacks in one sitting

3690
06:55:03,619 --> 06:55:05,619
Bug snacks in moderation seems to be okay

3691
06:55:08,380 --> 06:55:11,580
Come on snacks. Let's see what you got

3692
06:55:12,220 --> 06:55:17,259
Uh chum over here. I've just finished another device the trip drone with this

3693
06:55:17,340 --> 06:55:23,740
We can hold off the bug snacks and escape before chandlo collapses. Don't worry snort dog. He just explained that

3694
06:55:24,380 --> 06:55:26,060
All day

3695
06:55:26,060 --> 06:55:31,259
Oh, oh you beautiful fool. I'll pilot the drone you aim the shot

3696
06:55:31,900 --> 06:55:35,900
Unfortunately, you were short on connective surfaces. How about this?

3697
06:55:42,220 --> 06:56:22,229
All right, here we go, oh he's not gonna eat it get don't prevent them from going by

3698
06:56:23,819 --> 06:56:25,740
Don't trip

3699
06:56:25,740 --> 06:56:28,220
Hey, sir. I need a thing to get attached to

3700
06:56:41,110 --> 06:56:43,110
Thank you. Finally threw one

3701
06:56:43,189 --> 06:56:49,290
We crushed it dog i'm gonna give you the hug of your life don't celebrate too soon

3702
06:56:49,689 --> 06:56:52,889
We're not safe until we're off this horrid rock to the balloon

3703
06:56:53,959 --> 06:56:58,340
Out out everybody run

3704
06:56:58,340 --> 06:57:03,380
Help ephica and cromdo. Oh that two my least favorite characters in the game. Oh, we can't just burn by them. Okay

3705
06:57:04,500 --> 06:57:10,729
All this smoke is making my eyes water. There's one thing i'm good at. It's looking for trouble

3706
06:57:12,259 --> 06:57:16,659
Speaking up snacks at three o'clock. You got it fire in the hole

3707
06:57:20,979 --> 06:57:22,979
Nice shot

3708
06:57:28,950 --> 06:57:35,669
You know what it really is a shame is the fact that we stopped eating bug snacks and don't do bug snacks cosmetics

3709
06:57:36,150 --> 06:57:38,150
When you look like that

3710
06:57:41,900 --> 06:57:45,819
Like oh you wait, I can't eat like one of the cakes and get like a regular cake nose

3711
06:57:47,610 --> 06:57:49,930
I mean i've already gotten this far. I think

3712
06:57:51,500 --> 06:57:54,619
I can I do another one eat maybe one or two more

3713
06:57:56,299 --> 06:57:58,619
Here take this

3714
06:57:58,619 --> 06:58:12,220
There you go. Come on. Don't eat that. I should actually maybe you should eat that

3715
06:58:13,430 --> 06:58:16,569
Load it up

3716
06:58:16,569 --> 06:58:19,319
I don't think you can't lose

3717
06:58:34,060 --> 06:58:36,060
You did finish their quests

3718
06:58:37,290 --> 06:58:40,090
Yeah. Hey becca, uh, anyone you want with a spy on right now

3719
06:58:41,189 --> 06:58:44,950
Great opportunity. We're in the middle of a total panic. I could really find some secrets

3720
06:58:45,590 --> 06:59:05,299
Can we stop?

3721
06:59:05,299 --> 06:59:21,500
What did she take a picture of me?

3722
06:59:23,290 --> 06:59:34,229
Put the camera down

3723
06:59:46,700 --> 06:59:48,700
Help wiggle and ramble

3724
07:00:07,909 --> 07:00:11,189
So what that means his friend in the ball is evil

3725
07:00:14,659 --> 07:00:22,470
Hurt him so why'd snorpy have to go and why sprout? I didn't know you were so punk rock

3726
07:00:22,950 --> 07:00:27,909
I'm not a punk or I can't do this

3727
07:00:28,630 --> 07:00:36,869
Well, I know who can I have a name i've got them all warmed. It's time for you to bring the house down

3728
07:00:39,369 --> 07:00:41,159
All right

3729
07:00:41,159 --> 07:00:49,479
Go that way

3730
07:00:49,479 --> 07:01:14,060
Whoa grandma hates bug snacks

3731
07:01:18,099 --> 07:01:19,060
No

3732
07:01:19,060 --> 07:01:24,099
No, I don't oh man, I I bought in right at the top I really did

3733
07:01:39,380 --> 07:01:42,819
It's very good. It's a very very good game. I did I loved it

3734
07:01:43,779 --> 07:01:45,779
But we are gonna have to take a few points off

3735
07:01:46,659 --> 07:01:49,349
or though like

3736
07:01:49,509 --> 07:01:51,509
We have to have a twist ending

3737
07:01:53,659 --> 07:01:59,990
A few points have to be taken off

3738
07:02:00,069 --> 07:02:01,189
and

3739
07:02:01,189 --> 07:02:03,610

All right, get this special sauce them and they'll kill each other

3758
07:04:01,830 --> 07:04:04,169
Uh, what happens if there's only one left?

3759
07:04:11,979 --> 07:04:15,619
Oh, that's what happens. Okay, we just eat one

3760
07:04:27,590 --> 07:04:36,330
Quick to the boat to the flying boat. That's about as big a break as we're gonna get on wamby. It's now or never

3761
07:04:36,810 --> 07:04:40,580
I gave it my best

3762
07:04:41,799 --> 07:04:45,400
All right, trippy. Let's go home. Where is home?

3763
07:04:47,880 --> 07:04:49,979

I kill you

3767
07:05:08,680 --> 07:05:15,619
Yeah, we're gonna get a t-rex from jurassic park ending where the t-rex actually saves them, right?

3768
07:05:16,659 --> 07:05:19,340
Told you

3769
07:05:41,240 --> 07:06:09,400
Can I take a picture? I can't use the camera. Yeah, it's been 12 years think back on that time at bug snack island

3770
07:06:10,659 --> 07:06:16,709
Think back at the funny faces. I turned your face into a straw. Give you a pretzel for a head

3771
07:06:17,270 --> 07:06:27,659
Turned you into a fast food logo. Think about how painful your face probably is right now. I think about your songs

3772
07:06:28,220 --> 07:06:31,000
Now they made me laugh

3773
07:06:31,000 --> 07:06:38,220
Some of them most of them were terrible you I see a lot of you and me

3774
07:06:39,349 --> 07:06:45,020
Especially that hat and you i'll never forget that face

3775
07:06:47,580 --> 07:06:54,200
And you wait actually talk to them, oh right well there goes another farm

3776
07:06:56,180 --> 07:07:04,299
Me right for building it on top of a size pest. I guess there's no shame in starting fresh

3777
07:07:04,700 --> 07:07:07,459
I'll find a place with rich soil

3778
07:07:08,180 --> 07:07:10,180
And he talked to the eye

3779
07:07:16,439 --> 07:07:21,659
Dude you see that that was kind of like a side. I wait a minute. I don't know about that

3780
07:07:22,060 --> 07:07:28,659
I was so close to giving up back there. I get so caught up dwelling on the way lives end

3781
07:07:28,900 --> 07:07:37,319
It's not the only thing that matters. Yeah wambus and I we're gonna start the rest of our lives today

3782
07:07:39,849 --> 07:07:41,849
What about the tiffany cactus?

3783
07:07:43,459 --> 07:07:46,069
Yeah, uh

3784
07:07:46,069 --> 07:07:47,529
My friend

3785
07:07:47,529 --> 07:07:49,529
I don't think it's appropriate to

3786
07:07:50,090 --> 07:07:53,290
Take around like the cactus sex doll of your wife

3787
07:07:54,090 --> 07:07:59,880
Still I just like plant it plant it somewhere and like take all this off and let it just grow

3788
07:08:03,290 --> 07:08:07,529
You don't you don't find that a little weird like you don't tiffany. That's not a little weird to you

3789
07:08:08,009 --> 07:08:23,990
I spent on chasing one new and pink shame andy

3790
07:08:25,720 --> 07:08:31,319
No, i'm just saying he's carrying around a doll of you with you around like that's

3791
07:08:32,979 --> 07:08:36,659
You're gonna get jealous of the doll. You're gonna be like you got that fucking doll every day

3792
07:08:38,380 --> 07:08:41,180
It's me. I'm not good enough. I'm not as good as the doll

3793
07:08:42,180 --> 07:08:45,380
Well, I mean, I know that's not what i'm saying. No, I don't

3794
07:08:46,020 --> 07:08:52,939
Feel sad when I left all my of course you are of course you are

3795
07:08:57,259 --> 07:09:13,779
They tried to murder me also for real. Okay. All right. I have to just not look at the screen while you talk

3796
07:09:14,500 --> 07:09:17,459
Hey bestie didn't work. I still think I can see I can see it

3797
07:09:31,619 --> 07:09:38,759
Now I know to make new friends and this time I won't ruin it for myself

3798
07:09:39,720 --> 07:09:52,470
Gotta remember you

3799
07:09:52,470 --> 07:09:54,470
Okay, I know when i'm beat

3800
07:09:55,110 --> 07:09:57,349
I draw the line at island full of monsters

3801
07:09:58,939 --> 07:10:02,700
All I wanted to do was quit my dead-end job and do what makes me happy

3802
07:10:03,180 --> 07:10:07,659
I don't need some big bug snack scam to do that. I don't want to hear everybody's end of their

3803
07:10:12,549 --> 07:10:21,139
Check the boat

3804
07:10:21,139 --> 07:10:25,830
Why check the boat nothing on the boat? Thanks. Thanks for padding the ending of the game

3805
07:10:26,470 --> 07:10:32,439
I'll be very honest

3806
07:10:32,439 --> 07:10:35,080
I don't even want to hear your end of your whatever your last four

3807
07:10:35,560 --> 07:10:40,200
Dialogue pieces are because I didn't even care about you in the entire game. I didn't do any of your side quests

3808
07:10:40,279 --> 07:10:43,880
I don't even know who you are while I regret that all my research was destroyed

3809
07:10:43,959 --> 07:10:49,990
I have come away with a revelation cannot improve grumpest kind if I refuse to understand it

3810
07:10:50,389 --> 07:10:55,590
It may be a long and frankly annoying endeavor, but it is one worth pursuing

3811
07:10:57,270 --> 07:11:00,069
All right, she ate one of the donuts accidentally now you have a donut hand

3812
07:11:00,630 --> 07:11:04,840
Same thing with you. I don't know who you are either. I kind of know you wrong being right

3813
07:11:05,159 --> 07:11:12,810
I wish I hadn't wasted so much time telling riddles to give good advice

3814
07:11:13,209 --> 07:11:18,340
I just need to be me and those who listen will listen

3815
07:11:29,919 --> 07:11:31,220
smuggling

3816
07:11:31,220 --> 07:11:33,060
shitload

3817
07:11:33,060 --> 07:11:39,159
Back back home. Apparently they don't even know i'm taking them back with us

3818
07:11:39,720 --> 07:11:45,400
Seems my enemies aren't so all-powerful after all i'm gonna spread this around the world. They're gonna take over real soon

3819
07:11:46,279 --> 07:11:51,099
And chandler was always there. We're gonna have to go to customs. I'm gonna get stopped at the border

3820
07:11:52,139 --> 07:11:57,939
That was intense

3821
07:11:57,939 --> 07:12:01,060
There's no way I ever would have made it out of there by myself

3822
07:12:02,389 --> 07:12:06,650
Good thing snorphy had my back. When did he get so strong?

3823
07:12:07,450 --> 07:12:10,900
Maybe I hit my personal limit, but that doesn't matter

3824
07:12:11,639 --> 07:12:14,200
There's no limit to what we could do together

3825
07:12:15,689 --> 07:12:17,689
except for anything that requires

3826
07:12:18,650 --> 07:12:23,159
Fingers or toes that's off limits for a lot for now

3827
07:12:25,340 --> 07:12:33,209
Hey, buddy. I'm ready to go. All right, everybody or three people

3828
07:12:34,090 --> 07:12:38,569
What do you mean three people?

3829
07:12:55,860 --> 07:13:00,580
They'll be fine if anybody can survive in that terrible place or smelling

3830
07:13:03,509 --> 07:13:06,009
Right because all their noses are like fruits and vegetables

3831
07:13:07,369 --> 07:13:15,959
Or hearing or thinking this is like implanted in their brains

3832
07:13:21,750 --> 07:13:25,720
You're right. Nobody should ever set foot on snack tooth island again

3833
07:13:26,200 --> 07:13:30,819
What do we do about it? I know I can't go wallowing in regret now

3834
07:13:31,479 --> 07:13:33,720
We're barely even out of the woods

3835
07:13:33,720 --> 07:13:39,209
It's gonna take a while for the bug snacks to wear off on us. I can't go back home like this. So

3836
07:13:40,009 --> 07:13:44,009
Is it all right if I stay with you for a while? Absolutely not help you with your story

3837
07:13:44,330 --> 07:13:46,409
Maybe figure out which parts to tell or

3838
07:13:46,970 --> 07:13:48,389
I've

3839
07:13:48,389 --> 07:13:49,849
Absolutely not

3840
07:13:49,849 --> 07:13:51,750
I got a one bedroom

3841
07:13:51,750 --> 07:13:53,189
one bathroom

3842
07:13:53,189 --> 07:14:01,130
No, i'm sorry, but you know what sure great. Let's go

3843
07:14:16,220 --> 07:14:32,680
This one was just one over the road release them. No, i'm taking them home with me

3844
07:14:43,909 --> 07:14:45,669
You got guts

3845
07:14:45,669 --> 07:14:51,610
Tracking down elizabeth inside an erupting volcano. It's compelling dramatic sensational

3846
07:14:52,869 --> 07:14:57,029
I'd call it fiction if you didn't have this filibus yahoo along as a witness

3847
07:14:58,470 --> 07:15:03,349
It's filbo actually point is you're a regular grumpter s thompson

3848
07:15:03,909 --> 07:15:07,509
It's just too bad. Those bug snacks weren't real, huh?

3849
07:15:08,229 --> 07:15:10,229
Yeah, too bad

3850
07:15:11,110 --> 07:15:15,479
I I hate to think that we went through all that. Hey, would you like a gummy worm clumpy?

3851
07:15:15,880 --> 07:15:20,360
I hope you can spread the truth about snack tooth before anybody else gets hurt

3852
07:15:20,840 --> 07:15:27,080
Don't worry gnn specializes in painful truths and speaking of you're fired

3853
07:15:27,900 --> 07:15:33,419
His story's a page turner and all but you lost your job the second you walked out that door

3854
07:15:34,380 --> 07:15:37,479
That's

3855
07:15:37,479 --> 07:15:41,159
Oh, thanks. It's not like I expected you to come back

3856
07:15:41,959 --> 07:15:43,959
Also, you're legally dead

3857
07:15:44,360 --> 07:15:46,360
Might want to clear that up soon

3858
07:15:46,360 --> 07:15:53,020
It wasn't ideal but your bad worst days, huh buddy?

3859
07:15:53,580 --> 07:15:56,779
so I hear the elections are coming up and uh,

3860
07:15:57,580 --> 07:16:02,540
I'd say why'd you say that running for mayor? Why'd you say that? I could use a helping paw. What the hell?

3861
07:16:02,619 --> 07:16:04,619
How about it? You just fucked up my whole stream

3862
07:16:13,849 --> 07:16:16,169
bug snacks

3863
07:16:16,169 --> 07:16:18,069
by kevin zun

3864
07:16:18,069 --> 07:16:20,069
christopher stahlman megan vardy

3865
07:16:20,709 --> 07:16:22,069
john murphy

3866
07:16:22,069 --> 07:16:23,270
rice pulls

3867
07:16:23,270 --> 07:16:25,349
kevin geisler devin scott tunken

3868
07:16:26,310 --> 07:16:27,750
This is the song

3869
07:16:27,750 --> 07:16:41,299
Okay

3870
07:16:41,299 --> 07:16:42,340
so

3871
07:16:42,340 --> 07:16:44,259
Here's here's the deal

3872
07:16:44,259 --> 07:16:48,779
We climbed up i'm gonna give you what I think

3873
07:16:50,009 --> 07:16:51,130
we hit

3874
07:16:51,130 --> 07:16:52,659
peak

3875
07:16:52,659 --> 07:16:56,360
Yesterday afternoon yesterday night 77 78 79

3876
07:16:57,380 --> 07:16:59,619
79 by this afternoon 80

3877
07:17:00,180 --> 07:17:02,180
81 82 83

3878
07:17:03,040 --> 07:17:05,459
84 before we got to that last room

3879
07:17:07,419 --> 07:17:09,419
84 I was about to lock in in 84

3880
07:17:10,599 --> 07:17:13,959
I was about to lock it in

3881
07:17:13,959 --> 07:17:18,439
And then I wasn't a huge fan of the ending. It was I mean they tried to do something interesting

3882
07:17:18,520 --> 07:17:20,680
It brought I came down to 83 82 81

3883
07:17:21,240 --> 07:17:22,279
80

3884
07:17:22,279 --> 07:17:30,459
79 78 came down 78

3885
07:17:31,099 --> 07:17:36,619
Came all the way down to 78 and it's and it evened out there went to actually hit it actually the the candle wicked

3886
07:17:37,180 --> 07:17:39,180
At 75 let's be honest

3887
07:17:45,750 --> 07:17:48,729
Is all the voice actors?

3888
07:17:48,810 --> 07:17:52,310
That's cool

3889
07:17:52,310 --> 07:17:54,310
But then we we had a little bit of a bounce

3890
07:17:55,029 --> 07:17:57,799
of the 75

3891
07:17:57,799 --> 07:17:59,799
76 77 78

3892
07:18:00,310 --> 07:18:02,310
And we settled at 78

3893
07:18:05,209 --> 07:18:13,900
I think I still think it's a good game. It's very good. It was very very interesting. Very cute. Very different

3894
07:18:14,540 --> 07:18:16,900
I really liked it

3895
07:18:16,900 --> 07:18:18,900
This is a 78

3896
07:18:21,080 --> 07:18:30,180
78

3897
07:18:30,180 --> 07:18:32,340
It hit like 84 somewhere

3898
07:18:33,139 --> 07:18:35,700
It was around 79. You know what?

3899
07:18:37,419 --> 07:18:42,860
I can't give it an 80 though. I can't I can't I because it's like it's so that's so easy to say 80

3900
07:18:44,229 --> 07:18:47,669
Everything's an 8 out of 10. Everything's an 8 at 10 every game's an 8 at 10, right?

3901
07:18:48,310 --> 07:18:54,779
So just say 81 that's true

3902
07:18:55,819 --> 07:18:59,500
All right. I'm gonna give you a range so i'm between 78 and 81

3903
07:19:00,220 --> 07:19:05,529
That's where this game lies for me

3904
07:19:05,529 --> 07:19:08,970
It was very it was very good. It was very enjoyable. I liked it a lot

3905
07:19:09,209 --> 07:19:12,970
I wouldn't have screamed it for seven and a half hours today and yesterday, too

3906
07:19:14,340 --> 07:19:15,860
I loved it

3907
07:19:15,860 --> 07:19:17,860
I didn't super love it

3908
07:19:18,099 --> 07:19:29,939
It's an 81 done. No, it's not an 80. No, it's not. It's an 81

3909
07:19:32,759 --> 07:19:34,759
79.5 to 79.8

3910
07:19:36,759 --> 07:19:39,560
I can't tell I can't make my decision. It's a 78. I sent them away

3911
07:19:40,360 --> 07:19:44,119
It would be hard to make them disappear at this point 79.4 done

3912
07:19:47,020 --> 07:19:48,700
hard to say

3913
07:19:48,700 --> 07:19:50,619
Could be they're idiots

3914
07:19:50,619 --> 07:19:59,720
Could be they know the truth and they're keeping it quiet 79.5. It just got a blend

3915
07:20:00,680 --> 07:20:04,779
Yeah, this is like a weird creepy ending here we're getting a second one 79.5

3916
07:20:18,169 --> 07:20:21,770
But jokes aside with the extra, you know with the the score

3917
07:20:23,099 --> 07:20:25,099
Uh, the game's 25 bucks

3918
07:20:26,360 --> 07:20:30,580
It was that was incredibly enjoyable. It was very very good. It's great

3919
07:20:34,099 --> 07:20:36,740
I got what I I got my 25 dollars worth

3920
07:20:37,900 --> 07:20:46,180
12 plus hours of cute monsters and funny characters and it was great. I will give a stamp on recommend on this one

3921
07:20:46,340 --> 07:20:56,310
Thought it was very good a dollar an hour

3922
07:20:56,869 --> 07:21:04,650
You can't get a deal like that at very many places and that's where we're gonna end tonight

3923
07:21:05,130 --> 07:21:11,029
Thanks for watching everybody. This is a long one. It kind of broke my rules here, but i'm okay

3924
07:21:16,229 --> 07:21:19,270
Uh 50 dollars just came in 5 000 bits

3925
07:21:19,830 --> 07:21:22,360
from goiki and he says

3926
07:21:22,360 --> 07:21:29,720
This game is great. Fuck you for even as much as insinuating anything different. Anyways, here's 50 dollars. Well, thank you. I get thanks

3927
07:21:32,200 --> 07:21:34,599
Uh 79 is is good

3928
07:21:36,259 --> 07:21:39,619
Seven, uh, I remember it hit 85 at some point

3929
07:21:41,459 --> 07:21:45,939
You can't I don't just rate games based on just here's a flat rating. You guys know this

3930
07:21:46,560 --> 07:21:52,020
Resident evil 7 you remember? I will defend my score. I do not give games a rating

3931
07:21:52,020 --> 07:21:54,259
I give them a rating based on like where I currently am

3932
07:21:55,419 --> 07:21:58,700
The first like four hours of resident evil 7 was a 90

3933
07:21:59,419 --> 07:22:01,659
Hour number three through five was like a three

3934
07:22:02,459 --> 07:22:07,580
And then like the last two hours was like a 60 70 remember like I

3935
07:22:08,619 --> 07:22:21,669
I rate games differently than other people. What is a 95 game half-life 2?

3936
07:22:24,220 --> 07:22:27,020
No, that's not even accurate. I think half-life alex is better than half-life 2

3937
07:22:27,740 --> 07:22:32,630
Half-life alex is better than half-life 2. I just said it out loud with 10 000 people here. Hope I don't die

3938
07:22:40,729 --> 07:22:43,060
I hope i'm not like it

3939
07:22:43,060 --> 07:22:46,580
Just I hope I don't like it like incinerated by like the gaming god

3940
07:22:49,659 --> 07:23:02,950
Game gamer satan's gonna come out of my ground and electrocute me to death the reddit council monka s

3941
07:23:05,939 --> 07:23:11,220
I love half-life. I love it's a great series. I think half-life alex is the most fun i've had in a half-life game though

3942
07:23:12,099 --> 07:23:19,299
But it's not really fair because it's this new crazy technology and half-life 2 is like fucking 15 years old not fair

3943
07:23:21,560 --> 07:23:24,599
But uh, that's gonna be it. I will see you guys in a few days

3944
07:23:25,580 --> 07:23:28,939
Uh, what's today sunday? Let's see. Yeah

3945
07:23:31,560 --> 07:23:33,560
monday tuesday

3946
07:23:33,880 --> 07:23:37,639
Uh, probably wednesday or thursday. I'll see you guys again on wednesday or thursday

3947
07:23:37,639 --> 07:23:40,279
Keep an eye on the sauce over the next day or so give you a good date

3948
07:23:42,040 --> 07:23:43,700
bug snacks

3949
07:23:43,700 --> 07:23:44,740
delicious

3950
07:23:44,740 --> 07:23:50,250
So thursday, right just assume thursday always

3951
07:23:52,090 --> 07:23:57,590
We're gonna sell the uh credits here all the community subs all the gifted subs. Thanks guys

3952
07:24:00,700 --> 07:24:02,540
It's just

3953
07:24:02,540 --> 07:24:06,060
Okay, I open up tabs when I open up images that you guys link

3954
07:24:07,159 --> 07:24:09,060
and

3955
07:24:09,060 --> 07:24:14,500
They scare the shit out of me. Sometimes I just this was this was just the second tab that I clicked on

3956
07:24:15,060 --> 07:24:22,860
i'm blocking the credit

3957
07:24:24,470 --> 07:24:28,069
It was very good. I'm happy to have played bugs next they did they did a great job

3958
07:24:28,709 --> 07:24:45,529
Who's your favorite character?

3959
07:24:45,529 --> 07:25:00,700
Uh bobsicle bobsicle is my favorite character. What about your favorite grumpus?

3960
07:25:01,500 --> 07:25:04,060
Uh wiggly we already know that

3961
07:25:04,060 --> 07:25:06,060
Did I play the sequel if it came out? Yeah, absolutely

3962
07:25:06,380 --> 07:25:09,900
They're the character design and the actual game design with

3963
07:25:10,709 --> 07:25:13,430
Just looking at the bug snacks was the most fun part of the whole game

3964
07:25:14,310 --> 07:25:18,950
And they obviously this team has enough creative juices to make these awesome

3965
07:25:19,509 --> 07:25:23,430
Funny cute little monster food items. So I would love to see more of that

3966
07:25:23,990 --> 07:25:41,290
What are they not? Well, yeah, wait, how do you do a second one if you know that they're not cute? That's true

3967
07:25:43,319 --> 07:25:46,200
Yeah, how do you do a second one when everyone knows the

3968
07:25:46,759 --> 07:25:47,880
the twist

3969
07:25:47,880 --> 07:25:51,779
What are you gonna do? Okay, jedi academy

3970
07:25:52,180 --> 07:25:57,959

3971
07:26:05,860 --> 07:26:11,619
I think the the book is out on this one people either really really don't want me to do this or they really really really do

3972
07:26:20,659 --> 07:26:22,659

3981
07:27:32,389 --> 07:27:37,590
A ratatouille thing where everyone's just saying that and then when I actually buy this game and set it up and capture it

3982
07:27:37,909 --> 07:27:41,189
Everyone's gonna be like fuck this game. This game sucks. Stop playing it

3983
07:27:43,689 --> 07:27:48,090

3984
07:27:49,450 --> 07:27:51,290
