00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:08,250
Hello there. How you doing on this uh, fri- Thursday evening? Is it Thursday? It's Friday.

2
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:16,600
Uh, a little late today. I'm sorry. I've been so good too. I haven't ever since I opened up this

3
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:23,140
window with the three to four. I haven't been late for like six or seven weeks or something. It's

4
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:30,780
been great. But, uh, we're working together with Italics today. So we're kind of bouncing back and

5
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:34,380
forth. Hey, can you hear me? I can, I can't hear you. What are your audio levels like?

6
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:45,020
So we've been setting up and we're gonna play Risk of Rain 2 co-op. Everyone's talking about

7
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:51,140
this game. Apparently it's really good. I have not played it, but it looks very, very fun.

8
00:00:53,750 --> 00:01:08,260
Risk of Rain plus two. It's very addictive. It's that's so, so I've heard. Did I play the original?

9
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:26,069
I played. No, I enjoyed the original vicariously because I like, I think I've played it a few times

10
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:33,659
randomly. I don't think I own it though, but I've seen people play it and I've watched people play

11
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:39,239
it and it looked really fun and I vicariously played the game through other people. Never really

12
00:01:39,879 --> 00:01:46,500
gave it too much attention and I attribute that to the fact that this one is a third person 3D

13
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:51,930
perspective and the other one is the 2D side scrolling perspective and I like this

14
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:58,219
approach better. First game is apparently phenomenal and it looked phenomenal,

15
00:01:58,219 --> 00:02:11,879
but no, I did not really play it. You know that the item effects stack and don't have a limit,

16
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:18,949
right? I have no idea. Italics is going to pretty much be here to be the guy that answers every

17
00:02:18,949 --> 00:02:23,430
single question. So if you have a question tonight, ask Italics because he'll be able to answer it.

18
00:02:24,789 --> 00:02:29,430
So for the purpose of the stream, if you have a Risk of Rain 2 question, please put in your

19
00:02:29,509 --> 00:02:36,020
chat message, hey, it's Alix Dash, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, and I will ask him

20
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:50,280
because I don't fucking know anything. No, questions that pertain to the video game, okay?

21
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:58,009
I'm not going to relay, it has to be a gameplay related question and if it's not, then mods,

22
00:02:58,009 --> 00:03:03,430
clean them up. You know what I mean? Clean them up. If you don't know, clean them up is

23
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:12,710
germ of mob talk. Forget them out of here. But I think, oh, let's see if he's ready.

24
00:03:13,349 --> 00:03:24,469
Hello? Are you here? Hello. Are you with me? I am indeed. All righty. Hold on, you seem a bit loud.

25
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:34,870
Right click me in Discord, turn me down. How about like right there? Okay. I'm not on a webcam,

26
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:42,250
Mike, right? I don't think so. Remember the whole time I was on a webcam, Mike? No, I'm not. No,

27
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:50,259
I don't think you are. However, do you want to check your dashboard and click the accept button?

28
00:03:50,819 --> 00:04:00,969
Accept button? Where is it? Oh, this is just squads, man. Yeah, you are super loud. Hold on. Dude,

29
00:04:00,969 --> 00:04:08,169
we're in like a Twitch squad right now. We just like squatted the fuck up. What does that even do?

30
00:04:10,379 --> 00:04:18,180
All right, Chet. What that does is there's a button at the top of the stream

31
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:27,899
that is going to show our scores. No, we're hiding that information. Oh, I don't want to embarrass

32
00:04:27,899 --> 00:04:32,379
you. So you don't want to embarrass yourself. I mean, that's that could happen too. You can like

33
00:04:32,379 --> 00:04:38,540
click on the squad button up at the top and then it shows both streams at the same time like

34
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:45,259
multi-twitch and you even stay in the same chat room you were already in. What? But you see both

35
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:51,579
video feeds simultaneously and interchangeably click between them. Wait a minute. Wait, you lost

36
00:04:51,579 --> 00:04:58,680
me here. Hold on. Both streams at the same time? They call it squads because when you're playing

37
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:06,329
Apex with your friends. Yes, you just said the Voldemort word. Now everyone's going to want us

38
00:05:06,329 --> 00:05:14,579
to play Apex. Yeah, well, we'll go ahead and stop you there. So this is Risk of Rain 2.

39
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:19,939
All questions, by the way, please put hey italics dash and then your question because I won't be

40
00:05:19,939 --> 00:05:26,980
able to answer it. I won't read it because I'm not in your stupid chat chatters. It's a nice chat.

41
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:29,779
That's kind of an unbelievable thing to open up with. That's fine.

42
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:40,949
Everyone's like, oh my god, stop it. All right, you ready? Let's try this out. So

43
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:48,649
this is a game about collecting items. It's a game about, I think, collecting bugs. Collecting bugs.

44
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:55,300
So we have to be the same character, right? We both have to be the same character.

45
00:05:55,860 --> 00:06:03,529
There are six classes available, but they have to be unlocked. Okay, so double tap. Let's shoot

46
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:15,269
twice for two times 90% damage, which is 180% damage. Interesting. Okay, 180 damage phase round

47
00:06:15,269 --> 00:06:22,019
fire piercing bolt that hits all enemies in line for 230% damage. Okay. Well, no, that would be

48
00:06:22,019 --> 00:06:29,129
two. So there'd be like three and a half damage. How does it Hey, it's Alex. Hey, how does that

49
00:06:29,129 --> 00:06:37,560
work? I've never played this game. Oh, right. I didn't even play the first game. Wait, hold on.

50
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:45,019
You didn't play the first game either? No. So we're both just total scrub assholes then.

51
00:06:45,019 --> 00:06:53,209
I went through like a long, long tangent in the very beginning. Normally, I would be a good guide

52
00:06:53,209 --> 00:07:00,970
for a new Wow, this is not good. This is not good. I do. He's usually the guide. He's usually like

53
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:06,699
the game guide. Everybody tell told me like, why haven't you played risk of rain? And I said,

54
00:07:06,699 --> 00:07:11,980
because it's ugly and it's 2d and it's pixel art. And I hate those kind of games, as everybody knows.

55
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:17,209
Right. So now that it's 3d with graphics, I thought it's a perfect time to play. Well,

56
00:07:17,209 --> 00:07:22,810
you missed out because it was I watched the streamer beat it. I'm not going to say names

57
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:28,180
here. But the name was star. They beat it on stream. And it was great. It was great content.

58
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:42,470
So we're playing on the rainstorm difficulty, which sounds very thematic. Okay, cool. Quote,

59
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:47,339
the way the game was intended to be played. Okay. So those of you guys that have not paid

60
00:07:47,339 --> 00:07:53,850
attention at home, we've got a cross here. Sounds good. This is what is the $34? What's that mean?

61
00:07:55,529 --> 00:08:01,910
It means we need. Oh, I have 16. Remember when we linked our bank account when we installed? Right.

62
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:08,360
Right. Right. Right. So it's just constantly cross referencing and checking and find and

63
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:13,339
activate. Basically, there's a direct line of credit to the loot boxes. Okay. So you get money.

64
00:08:13,339 --> 00:08:16,300
Do I have to collect to collect the money or just is it just happening? Okay. People are starting

65
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:23,430
to come out here. Okay. That hurt. That's a dodge roll. And this is like a super shot. Okay. And

66
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:34,139
that's a phaser. So yeah, you have your default shoot. One of them is like a stun. Yeah, you got

67
00:08:34,379 --> 00:08:43,450
like a three round burst. So does dodge have iframes? That's all I care about. I think you

68
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:51,659
just move so fast. It's physically impossible for anybody else to hit you. What I get personal

69
00:08:51,659 --> 00:08:57,379
shield generator. I got a recharging shield now. I think we should probably leave, right? Oh, you're

70
00:08:57,379 --> 00:09:10,600
like, I'm over here. I was just standing in like the starter area. Oops. So I don't know what any

71
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,960
item does. We're just going to pick stuff up at random. Shift is sprint. All right. So is there

72
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:20,919
like a we should probably stay together. That's great. Recharging shield. So just there's boxes

73
00:09:20,919 --> 00:09:25,960
all over the ground. There's boxes all over the ground. And we're killing things and getting

74
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:33,529
money. There's also boxes on the ground that have money. Are you up? I'll come to you. So this is

75
00:09:33,529 --> 00:09:38,870
the teleporter, right? Our goal is to find the teleporter. And whenever we want to activate it,

76
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:43,990
so we can stay here and grind for as long as we want. Really? The longer we stay the meter

77
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:50,309
at the top right. Sticky bond. It says easy gets progressively more difficult. Oh, interesting.

78
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:58,860
We're basically trying to superpower ourselves. And then when we're done doing that,

79
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:05,129
we move into the next levels. Yeah. So is it based on levels or is it? Hey, it's Alex. Hey,

80
00:10:05,129 --> 00:10:12,500
is this based on levels or is it based on to just try to grind as hard as you can in one area?

81
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:24,620
Both, I think. Okay. All right. Do you got how much money you got? Have you? I've been

82
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:35,320
opening everything. I see. I'm going to come to you. I do like dodge roll. I have like a war

83
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:42,309
banner. How did you even get up there? I think I used a jump pad. A jump pad?

84
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:48,580
I'll activate teleporter. Don't touch that, right? Not unless we're absolutely ready.

85
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:56,860
No, we're not. Right. Are we ready? I don't know. How much money do you have? I have 72 bucks.

86
00:10:56,860 --> 00:11:02,919
I have 34 dollars. I just bought something. I just got gasoline. Drop a war banner on leveling up,

87
00:11:02,919 --> 00:11:08,279
giving you great strength. Okay. That's what I got. That's what that is. So if you like fight

88
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:16,389
inside of that, you get like bonus stats to everything. Interesting. Like attack speed up,

89
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:21,610
maybe damage. We should just hang out up here then just grind money.

90
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:25,929
Who cares? Well, if we run around the map, we can find more boxes to

91
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:39,590
purchase upgrades. Cool. Jerma thinks he's good at the game. I'm like asking questions. I'm asking

92
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:43,830
like, oh, okay, so we do this. What about this? What do we do about this? I think she's fucking

93
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:58,870
good at the game. I'm like asking questions. What'd you just do? This is an E3 presentation.

94
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:09,980
So what about over here? Hey, Taliesin, watch out for those skulls. They're dangerous.

95
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:13,100
You literally cut off. Hey, watch out for the...

96
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:22,840
Dying main character fails to communicate most important line of dialogue to new supporting

97
00:12:23,639 --> 00:12:31,509
main character role. Easy. Am I gonna die? Oh no. I thought I just got killed. All right. Here's a

98
00:12:31,509 --> 00:12:37,580
box. Open it. I do like this money system. Fire a swarm of missiles. I like getting paid all the

99
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:44,700
time too. Okay. I think we may have just spawned everything. Look at over here. One lunar. Okay.

100
00:12:46,139 --> 00:12:50,940
We just spawned everything. Did you do like some kind of mountain? No. Like cursed item? What is

101
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:57,419
this? I don't know. I don't think so. I just picked it. I just picked an item up. You definitely did

102
00:12:57,419 --> 00:13:03,740
this. I didn't. I swear to god I didn't do anything. It was a trap up here. I pressed the... I opened

103
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:14,809
up an orange case and got a new item. Can we stack these war banners? Do they like... Somebody said

104
00:13:14,809 --> 00:13:19,450
apparently everything is stackable in the whole game. Really? I think so. So the whole point is

105
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:25,850
just becoming more overpowered. I guess, yeah. People are saying activate the teleporter.

106
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:32,019
Should we do that or should we wait till medium? I don't know. I guess we can just do it now and

107
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:39,129
see what happens. I mean we're pretty close to medium. I think we can handle it. Noticing more

108
00:13:39,129 --> 00:13:45,450
elites popping up. Is that what the flame on the head means? I think the flame on the head. I have

109
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:54,250
like an ability that sets it on fire. Deleting elite monster items. 3D printer. Oh I think I can

110
00:13:54,250 --> 00:14:02,549
just deal extra damage to bosses. Cool. So are there headshots in this game? Now obviously these

111
00:14:02,549 --> 00:14:06,789
enemies are only head. Yeah. It doesn't feel like there is. They might be. They might be.

112
00:14:08,059 --> 00:14:12,940
But I don't think there is. All right. Teleporter. Are we going to just activate it?

113
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:18,179
Might as well just see what it does. Hey there is fall damage. How bad is it on a scale of one to

114
00:14:18,179 --> 00:14:25,350
ten? Uh two. Okay let's say I was like one is I jump off of the ledge and ten is I jump off of

115
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:36,860
like a building. Um can you can you go over that like scale again? How bad is it? The joke the joke

116
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:42,860
is that... Scale of one. The joke is... Jump off of a ledge. The joke is that is the scale. So like

117
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:50,169
it would be like four and it was fucking hilarious. You should see my chat right now. I activated the

118
00:14:50,169 --> 00:14:53,610
teleporter. No most time when like somebody says something fucking dumb or weird you see like a

119
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:57,690
bunch of question marks. I don't know about what's going on in your stream but that's like a ton of

120
00:14:57,690 --> 00:15:03,139
laughs. All right so that's the boss. Stone Titan. I don't think the question marks are laughs.

121
00:15:03,139 --> 00:15:15,929
Chris Vanguard. Uh he's killing me. Just don't die. Uh okay I'll deal with the adds. Don't don't say

122
00:15:15,929 --> 00:15:24,700
that. What? What would you classify these as? Are we running ads right now? No don't say that

123
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:30,059
word. Don't do not say the word add. No but like you said it in the context of like the advertisement.

124
00:15:30,059 --> 00:15:38,549
Are you dead? Can I get you? I'm dead. How do I revive you? We should have done it earlier.

125
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:46,919
We should have activated the easy mode earlier. Easy mode. They got fragged. Enter the teleporter.

126
00:15:46,919 --> 00:15:52,700
Hold on but is there a way I can get you back or are you actually just dead? I think I'm actually

127
00:15:52,779 --> 00:16:00,519
just dead. Interesting okay. I come back at the end of the level so good luck. There's no way I'm

128
00:16:00,519 --> 00:16:05,879
gonna beat this. I can 100% guarantee that this is not going to be completed. Just line them all up

129
00:16:05,879 --> 00:16:12,570
and get a collateral. I mean I'm trying. Okay well that was a good try. You did go narrowly right

130
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:17,929
through every other. Hey it's hard when you got fucking 100 people. What is this? What are your

131
00:16:17,929 --> 00:16:33,669
like fireworks? It's my special move. There's too many of these heads. This is not even the boss.

132
00:16:34,389 --> 00:16:39,429
Is this why when I looked over everyone was saying teleporter teleporter teleporter teleporter

133
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:46,470
I'm minus one health. Oh that means I'm dead. Good now I don't feel so bad.

134
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:53,909
We can die together in eternal bliss. Medium on the first level. That apparently was not a good

135
00:16:53,909 --> 00:17:06,500
idea. So can we just keep going? Yeah I think we just try to get good. All right let's go. Let's

136
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:11,859
do it. Let's get good. I don't know if you know I just I just beat Sekiro on stream like last week.

137
00:17:11,859 --> 00:17:15,539
I don't know if you know that but I mean obviously you know that. How many times did you die? Because

138
00:17:15,539 --> 00:17:19,700
that's how many times we have to die here before we can beat this game. I act like we didn't talk

139
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:26,980
about it downstairs. Yeah I was just wanting you to repeat it for everyone else to hear.

140
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:34,779
All right you out of your egg? No. Well come on we gotta go. It's like it's time. Okay. You can't

141
00:17:34,779 --> 00:17:39,420
just sit in there. I'm going. All right we gotta find teleporter and win go quick. That hurts by

142
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:43,339
the way. I don't think we're supposed to find the teleporter first. There's actual team damage.

143
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:49,910
You know what I'm just gonna blame the RNG. Okay the drops the drops were terrible.

144
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:54,549
Now blame the fact that we didn't we were supposed to just activate the teleporter.

145
00:17:54,549 --> 00:18:01,700
Keep going. This is a game about speed. We have to split up a little bit because we have to find the

146
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:15,779
teleporter. Yeah we do have to find the teleporter. You're right. There we go. I'm just trying to get

147
00:18:15,779 --> 00:18:21,400
some money. Imagine this game on insane difficulty. I didn't have a shield like you did. That's why I

148
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:27,819
died so fast. Can you imagine this game on insane? That definitely is an insane difficulty. It has to

149
00:18:27,819 --> 00:18:36,680
be. There is one higher than this. This game is a race against the difficulty. This is what twitch user

150
00:18:38,569 --> 00:18:44,009
uh I don't know what was their name. This game is a race. I don't know. Please cite your sources.

151
00:18:44,009 --> 00:18:51,430
Thank you. That was that was your homework on Wikipedia right now. What was their name?

152
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:57,180
Taco Tangler. There's no enemies in this game. All right so if you have a if you have a question

153
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:02,140
ask Taco Tay. I want everyone to add to preface their questions. Hey Taco Tangler.

154
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:19,109
Yeah we're using MLA or Chicago style. Chicago style is the hot dog? What did you just say? Foreign

155
00:19:19,109 --> 00:19:24,170
fruit heal on use. Interesting. I told you to cite your sources. I didn't know which one you were

156
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:31,670
using. We're doing hot dog style. Oh all right. We let's go. We're gonna find no more like funny

157
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:36,869
jokes. The teleporter is right here. All right let's activate it right now. Why not? Can we? Yeah I get

158
00:19:36,869 --> 00:19:43,430
it. We're so weak. But let's go. All right you asked for it. See now we kill it. There's not we're

159
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:52,339
not going to get overwhelmed. Kill it quick. Headshots only. Giant ant. Told you we were

160
00:19:52,339 --> 00:20:02,759
collecting bugs. What is this thing? Speaking of bugs I have like a bug that's healing me or

161
00:20:02,759 --> 00:20:07,460
something. Hold on I'm gonna go stand over here with your heal bug. I think I have. That hurt a

162
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:15,559
lot. Is this a heal bug? Oh god. I just used my heal and nothing happened. I think I'm gonna

163
00:20:15,559 --> 00:20:18,920
heal right now. Am I dead again? Oh you're dead? All right let me see if I can do this. Told you we

164
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:30,519
should have done this. Well look he's at like 40% HP. My heal did not do anything. Oh my god.

165
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:36,170
I thought we're not ready. We gotta have more like power-ups before we activate this.

166
00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:42,730
Oh that was a personal shield. We might we might actually maybe I just killed my healer. All right

167
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:52,599
personal goals for today. Beat level one. Personal goal. Complete level one. I'll get it. It's harder

168
00:20:52,599 --> 00:21:11,319
than Monster Hunter. Come on give me that heal. Give me that heal. How funny would it be if it was the exact

169
00:21:11,319 --> 00:21:20,259
same problem this Monster Hunter? This is like four player difficulty. I'm dead. The bug doesn't

170
00:21:20,259 --> 00:21:27,299
heal. The bug doesn't heal. Well I I had an actual heal in my pocket that didn't heal. Hey Taco Tangler!

171
00:21:28,099 --> 00:21:33,579
Uh what's what are we doing wrong here? We're on the wrong difficulty? I think we just I think we

172
00:21:33,579 --> 00:21:39,269
need some more power-ups. We gotta split up. Get money. Let's let's say like open at least five

173
00:21:39,349 --> 00:21:48,039
boxes each. All right five boxes each. Minimum. Just get more items but don't let it go all the

174
00:21:48,039 --> 00:21:53,559
way into like medium territory. Okay yeah five boxes is too much. Be fast. What does Taco Tangler

175
00:21:53,559 --> 00:22:01,180
say? This is a he's the expert. Grab a few chests and level a little bit before activating the

176
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:04,859
teleporter. Then once the event is over you can get the remaining items. All right that sounds good.

177
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:17,460
Thanks Taco Tangler. That wasn't even Taco Tangler. Somebody else. Wait Taco Tangler left.

178
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:20,900
Taco Tangler didn't get enough credit. All right we gotta hurry. No they're still here.

179
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:31,900
All right let's go. I'm going this way. I'm gonna bang a right. The little boxes that don't cost

180
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:37,690
anything have money in them. Yeah so it's a race against the difficulty. You gotta get a couple

181
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:50,460
items, couple levels. So are crits random? I think there's something that can influence it.

182
00:22:50,460 --> 00:23:07,799
34 bucks? Shit I don't have enough. 55. All right 34. Let's go. I went to a dead end. Okay that is

183
00:23:08,599 --> 00:23:19,430
extra. I got an extra jump. Okay that's pretty useful. Small natural crit chance. 23 bucks.

184
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:23,750
Don't got enough. What is that? I almost just jumped off the ledge. I'm so glad you did.

185
00:23:26,119 --> 00:23:31,160
Okay teleport is by me. Chat's a natural hazard. Okay there's a lot of items over here too. Okay

186
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:38,039
teleporter right next to me. Okay I haven't even got one box yet. Offer to shrine of chance. 23

187
00:23:38,039 --> 00:23:45,430
dollars. Okay you offer to shrine but gain nothing. Thanks. Middle click is a ping. Oh shit. Okay

188
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:50,099
well that's not what the teleporter is but that's a ping that you can see. You gain nothing. Wow.

189
00:23:50,099 --> 00:23:57,430
Twice in a row. Shrine of chance. Las Vegas baby. Dude RNG in this game is a little like wonky.

190
00:24:08,549 --> 00:24:11,349
Oh my god. Oh my god. Why the fuck am I getting swarmed in here?

191
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:26,920
Holy shit. Remember when I said five boxes? I'll settle for one. Jesus there's like there's a few

192
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:34,019
boxes over by me. I almost got enough money to do it. Somebody's like a sniper rifle over here.

193
00:24:34,019 --> 00:24:47,369
Let's go back to this robot. All right I got a lot of money now. Let's go. They have to make these

194
00:24:47,369 --> 00:24:52,789
boxes 69 dollars on purpose. Like that's not that's just part of the development cycle. All right I'm

195
00:24:52,789 --> 00:24:57,740
gonna have like three or four boxes by the time this is done here. So this is uh dealing damage

196
00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:06,819
heals you. That's pretty amazing. Okay oh god. How much does it heal? Can't really tell. Kind of heading

197
00:25:06,819 --> 00:25:18,579
towards you. I've only got one box so far. I got two. Did you actually just hit me out of the air?

198
00:25:18,579 --> 00:25:22,740
Oh this is this leech is incredible. Like I'm every time I get hit it just heals back up.

199
00:25:23,299 --> 00:25:32,500
How much money you got? Uh 50 bucks. What's the uh purple dollar sign for? I'm not sure.

200
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:47,859
Gain temporary flight. Set okay missile launcher swarm of missiles. All right I've got three items

201
00:25:47,859 --> 00:25:56,700
now. Four items. Sticky bomb. Chance on hit. All right I got I have five I got five items.

202
00:25:58,599 --> 00:26:02,680
I got like the war banner thing. All right I now have two items.

203
00:26:07,019 --> 00:26:23,079
Deal extra damage to bosses. I like that one. Okay I you know you almost ready to go here?

204
00:26:27,079 --> 00:26:37,369
69. What is this one? I got it. What the fuck? I can jump three times. Okay everything stacks.

205
00:26:37,369 --> 00:26:44,410
Assuming we win you get to keep that for the next. That's amazing. The next life and you just keep

206
00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:50,900
getting more powerful. Is there like a soft way to land? Although I guess I have temporary flight so

207
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:54,980
I'll just activate that on the way down right? Probably yeah. Okay I'm just gonna get another

208
00:26:54,980 --> 00:27:03,130
item. Here we go. What does this thing do? Well that was sick. Teleport. People are screaming

209
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:10,099
as to do teleporter. They're saying we're gonna run out of our opportunity here. Okay um are there

210
00:27:10,099 --> 00:27:15,430
any more leftover boxes down here? Uh I don't there's one over here I think. And get did you

211
00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:23,000
activate it? The teleporter? No. Oh god. Because I still have 70 dollars. I just need I can't spend

212
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:28,759
my money. All right well you can save it. All right let's go. Yes you can yeah. Turn on the shrine.

213
00:27:29,319 --> 00:27:39,000
What's that? Oh boy. Monster tooth. Drop a healing orb on kill. You can do it again. What did that

214
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:49,029
just do? What are we gonna activate it? Yeah let's go. Oh god I'm not ready. Just kill this

215
00:27:49,029 --> 00:28:00,410
last robot and then spawn him. And we're gonna do it man. We gotta go. Oh is that the boss up

216
00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:11,940
there? Yeah it is. Yeah those are the bosses all right. I'm gonna get some distance. Whichever

217
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:30,539
that's like a big explosion I think. Oh my god there's so many. We gotta focus on one of them.

218
00:28:30,539 --> 00:28:33,579
Focus on the one with the less health. I know I was just running away. We're like running into the

219
00:28:33,579 --> 00:28:41,849
corner. We're so dead. We're gonna die again. You understand that right? Hold on. We're like

220
00:28:41,849 --> 00:28:54,569
fundamentally doing something wrong. One of them is dead. One of them's dead. Good. So am I. Oh

221
00:28:54,569 --> 00:29:07,450
you're dead. We are fundamentally doing something incorrect. Because he's not even at 50% health.

222
00:29:16,599 --> 00:29:31,099
Get all items first. Well doesn't that make the boss harder? How far can I run? Wait I can share

223
00:29:31,099 --> 00:29:42,980
items with you? How? How far away can I go? Okay not doing anything wrong. It's just a really hard

224
00:29:42,980 --> 00:30:05,420
game. Okay I see. I'm gonna fall off the ledge. This game sucks. This character. All right taco.

225
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:13,180
No no no no no. Somebody said this character sucks early and is more geared towards late game.

226
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:23,240
But it's the first character though. That's not what I was trying to say. Stop sniping me. This

227
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:49,940
game sucks. That's not what I was trying to say. Turn the game up a little. Unlucky boss.

228
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:54,660
Unfortunate. Wait is this boss just like ridiculous? Just like a weird hard

229
00:30:55,539 --> 00:31:03,859
RNG role of a boss? Why is the teleporter only at 57%? Yeah people are saying that this is this

230
00:31:03,859 --> 00:31:07,940
boss. We kind of got like a bad role for like early new players because he's just like annoying

231
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:16,599
and hard to deal with. You might still do it. Oh god look at that like caravan of people behind

232
00:31:16,599 --> 00:31:22,359
them. Yes I see all of them. There's so many. Oh they're behind me now too. And by the way we

233
00:31:22,359 --> 00:31:29,769
have to stay inside the bubble around the teleporter to charge it. Oh god. We need to stay in the

234
00:31:29,769 --> 00:31:41,029
teleporter sphere. So do you have to kill the boss? Yeah I think so. What is this ice demon?

235
00:31:41,670 --> 00:32:01,589
No you almost got it. At 99% charge monsters stop spawning. Oh that's a huge deal. That is a huge

236
00:32:01,589 --> 00:32:14,470
deal. That's good to know. Wait is that not true? Is somebody just lying? Somebody just lying? Okay

237
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:25,609
I'm definitely dead here. Says a lie? No it's true. It is true. Okay monsters will stop spawning at

238
00:32:25,609 --> 00:32:52,299
99%. You're on medium difficulty now. Help me. This game's crazy. I'm dead. I was so close.

239
00:32:53,339 --> 00:32:56,940
So people are asking why we're not playing the star. Because we're dying on the first

240
00:32:56,940 --> 00:33:00,380
level. And we're dying on level one. And he has like a hundred hours in the game.

241
00:33:01,019 --> 00:33:04,779
So you think you think he's gonna want to play with two chumps that are starting out in like

242
00:33:04,779 --> 00:33:14,920
the noob level? We're dying on level one. He's like he has like 150 hours in the game right now.

243
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:28,730
Push continue. Maybe when we get a little better maybe he can jump in. Let us get through like the

244
00:33:28,730 --> 00:33:48,420
first level first. I guess this is we got it this time. This time charge inside. So we're on like

245
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:57,210
the regular difficulty. Learn on drizzle. Drizzle is too easy. Play drizzle until you get used to

246
00:33:57,210 --> 00:34:03,130
the game. Says weeping and gnashing is replaced by laughter and tickles.

247
00:34:09,019 --> 00:34:15,019
Drizzle is baby mode. I don't think you're allowed to stream on that mode. I think if you stream on

248
00:34:15,019 --> 00:34:20,119
that mode people laugh at you. Yeah I think something goes bad. But it's okay because okay

249
00:34:20,119 --> 00:34:24,039
let's do like a few more attempts on rainstorm and if I'm all right with doing the drizzle mode.

250
00:34:27,349 --> 00:34:30,550
I think we can do it. I think we were pretty close. We just have to lock it in.

251
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:41,110
Yeah let's lock it in. Let's go. We'll be laughing at you no matter what.

252
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:49,079
I think we're starting to understand the basic elements of the game. Starting to figure it out.

253
00:34:49,079 --> 00:35:01,579
Yeah I felt like I actually did a lot better last time. Yeah charge the pod. That whole

254
00:35:01,579 --> 00:35:17,050
enemies not spawning after 99% is actually a big deal. This way try to get some money. I got 34.

255
00:35:17,769 --> 00:35:27,130
Why would we spawn up here? RNG man. We won't laugh at you guys for playing drizzle. We'll laugh at

256
00:35:27,130 --> 00:35:34,889
you when you die at the first level on drizzle. That's fair. Okay that's actually fair. Yeah

257
00:35:34,889 --> 00:35:40,789
no that's the decent terms. I could agree to those terms. I'm afraid to agree to those terms though

258
00:35:40,789 --> 00:35:45,590
because I feel like when you agree to those terms if something goes wrong and you lose you have all

259
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:50,469
your credibility is gone forever. But then you have to just play again but on the hardest difficulty

260
00:35:50,469 --> 00:35:58,900
and then win. That's the only way you could get your credit back I think. There's nothing over here.

261
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:05,559
Your gamer licenses have been revoked. Take it like this. If Sekiro had a drizzle mode would

262
00:36:05,559 --> 00:36:11,639
you play on it? No. Uh-oh not this conversation. We already talked about this last night. Oh we

263
00:36:11,639 --> 00:36:19,159
already wrapped around. Where hang on where's where are we supposed to go? Uh I came down

264
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:27,449
okay well we got we both have money. Have you gone down here already? Yeah but not all the way down

265
00:36:28,010 --> 00:36:43,349
but I just got exploded on. Sekiro with guns baby. Lost on the first level. Come on give us a break.

266
00:36:43,349 --> 00:36:47,349
We're trying we're trying to figure it out. This is we're brand new risk of rain 2 players.

267
00:36:48,070 --> 00:36:54,389
Yeah don't push us away risk of rain 1 veterans okay. You want people to play your like fun

268
00:36:54,389 --> 00:37:00,710
franchise? This is this is how you do it. I got the bandolier chance on kill drop an ammo pack

269
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:07,639
that resets cooldowns. That's pretty awesome. What's this one? Your offer to the shrine is

270
00:37:07,639 --> 00:37:15,050
rewarded. I get a hundred percent crits for eight seconds. That's actually great. What is that?

271
00:37:15,050 --> 00:37:18,489
I found the teleport. I got a friend. I have like a turret friend. We have like a new party member.

272
00:37:19,130 --> 00:37:27,780
Oh it's it's star. Star just joined the game. He's like a turret. He's a mini sentry. Does he move?

273
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:34,889
I don't think so. There's a turret yeah that turret's pretty awesome though. We could like

274
00:37:34,889 --> 00:37:41,510
lead because the teleporter's right here so he's gonna help. Yeah we'll just lead every enemy to

275
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:46,539
that thing. All right we got to keep moving. Is that a health bar? That thing is amazing.

276
00:37:47,849 --> 00:37:53,639
It can it die? I assume it can get exploded. It has a health bar. What's this one? This one's smoking

277
00:37:53,639 --> 00:38:00,760
60 something. Is this the same level we were just on but everything's different or is the

278
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:08,280
level actually randomly generated? Spawned on here. Taco my turret. I need help taco.

279
00:38:10,409 --> 00:38:16,170
Yes yes yes doesn't help. I asked two questions. I got a healing drone. I have a lot of like robots

280
00:38:16,170 --> 00:38:21,849
with me. All right come down here. I feel like this is the spot to be. Oh no I have to choose

281
00:38:21,849 --> 00:38:34,440
which one I want. Yes no. It's slightly different okay. All right what about how much money do I

282
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:42,460
have? 55? What do I need? 60 to open this? Drones are a huge deal. The generic layout is the same

283
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:46,760
with some doors and bridges that have changed. Okay what is the launch? Each level has two to

284
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:54,460
three variations mostly static items are random and I assume also the layout. Oh my god do you

285
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:59,980
kid me? Got two turrets. All right I got so much money I don't know what to do with it. I guess

286
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:02,219
I'll spend it at this shrine. I think we're gonna win. I think we're gonna win this level just

287
00:39:02,219 --> 00:39:18,730
because of the turrets. Crowbar. Dude these guys are gonna be the first level. Are you kidding me?

288
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:29,619
I was here. World first. All right give me this thing. So you have a heal drone too? Yeah. You

289
00:39:29,619 --> 00:39:33,139
have two like drones on the ground and a heal drone. That's pretty sick. That's got a guitar.

290
00:39:33,139 --> 00:39:41,539
And his music. What is this door? It's electric. What? Nothing. What does a ukulele do? Are we

291
00:39:41,539 --> 00:39:49,190
ready to pop it? Pop it. We gotta stay in here though. I don't see any more chests but I have

292
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:52,550
like two hundred dollars. That's the best item. I don't know what it does. What does it do?

293
00:39:54,329 --> 00:40:02,090
Taco. Taco Tuesday. What does it do? Probably like plays music. All right you ready? I'm going. Here

294
00:40:02,090 --> 00:40:13,369
we go. All right we got just gotta stay inside the red. Where are they? Oh it's that guy. It's a big.

295
00:40:14,250 --> 00:40:26,090
Where is it? It's the big guy. He's a big jellyfish. All right get in the red. He shoots

296
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:30,170
like a slow moving zappy orb. Oh my god. And then a then a bunch of fast ones.

297
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:41,110
Going for max crits. I think you can stop those. Just just be careful when they get to the

298
00:40:41,110 --> 00:40:46,780
destination. All right I did a ton of damage. Eight seconds of crits was pretty sick. That was

299
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:55,320
awesome. We're doing it. Watch out for that orb. I don't know what this is. Just run. What does that

300
00:40:55,320 --> 00:41:03,320
mean? I don't know. I don't know but it did a lot of damage. E3 pretend gameplay. Watch out man.

301
00:41:07,530 --> 00:41:11,559
Nice work. He's dead. They did it. They beat the first level. Now we just have to charge the

302
00:41:11,559 --> 00:41:20,420
teleporter. That was way easier than the other guy. He really was. What's this? Chance to fire

303
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:24,900
a missile. Chance to fire a missile. He oh he drops a bunch of shit and I just took it all.

304
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:34,329
I'm a greedy fuck. Oh I see how it is. The drone guy. I thought I just I saw items and I pick them

305
00:41:34,329 --> 00:41:42,250
up. Someone took both boss items. Yeah I did. I'm gonna be the cannon. I didn't know what it

306
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:46,570
did. That was how the game. I just saw an item on the ground. I have a shriveled mat. I'm not

307
00:41:46,570 --> 00:41:52,309
showing you an item. This game's old school. You have to like get to really test your friendships

308
00:41:52,309 --> 00:41:58,630
okay. Everyone's saying shame on you. Not personal loot. Yeah okay guys. This isn't Diablo 3. This is

309
00:41:58,630 --> 00:42:05,829
called fucking snooze you'll lose. All right are we ready? How do you kick someone from a lobby?

310
00:42:07,590 --> 00:42:19,260
Taco how do you kick someone from a lobby? Open oh open all the boxes. Oh I think after the

311
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:27,480
boss dies we can go around and pick up all the we're on medium difficulty now. We are on medium

312
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:35,139
now yes permanently I guess. Okay well it's because we're not going fast enough. They should

313
00:42:35,139 --> 00:42:41,269
have just risk of rain like rain's not that fast. I feel like it should have been called risk of rain

314
00:42:41,269 --> 00:42:48,219
you know to indicate the speed. Oh never mind. What's hitting me? Oh all your money gets converted

315
00:42:48,219 --> 00:42:52,940
to experience after you get into okay all your money gets turned into experience when you go

316
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:58,780
into teleporter so you gotta spend it. Don't hoard your cash spend it or maybe if you need

317
00:42:58,780 --> 00:43:02,619
to level up. Oh so all my money's gone from all your money every cent you have is gone it's

318
00:43:02,619 --> 00:43:10,760
experience now. Wait it turns into xp? Turns into experience. Turns into experience? It turns into

319
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:24,150
experience. Why is the ammo on the ground even doing? All right 82 let's go. Why is he jumping

320
00:43:24,150 --> 00:43:33,179
so much? 3d glasses chance to critically strike. Oh it wasn't charged. What the hell was this thing?

321
00:43:35,590 --> 00:43:41,510
Heal all nearby allies after standing still for two seconds. Turn around. I'm a healer now.

322
00:43:42,070 --> 00:44:00,460
What is this thing? 72 I don't have enough. Come at me. This is gonna be easy. What's this thing?

323
00:44:00,460 --> 00:44:05,579
Oh a little lance. Change to bleed. So everything's way more expensive now but are enemies worth more

324
00:44:05,579 --> 00:44:18,090
money? Uh looks like it yeah. I assume so. Pick one. Yeah I picked it. Oh how you doing? You get

325
00:44:18,090 --> 00:44:25,429
nothing. How am I doing? Yeah. Pretty good. Um I've got a crowbar times two. It also can heal you

326
00:44:25,429 --> 00:44:34,489
apparently. Lunar. What is lunar? I think it's like a special type of currency. Okay so it's like a

327
00:44:34,489 --> 00:44:48,699
special kind of currency thing? Is that what you're just saying? Okay I see this game is serious.

328
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:57,269
That's why that's what I've heard. That's fine. I plan on taking it seriously. There's an uh box

329
00:44:57,269 --> 00:45:03,340
up here. I see where you are. What's that? Look at that. What's down there? Uh what are you talking

330
00:45:03,340 --> 00:45:12,469
about? There's a ton of boxes down the swamp. I have no idea. Are we just throwing boxes at me?

331
00:45:12,469 --> 00:45:26,969
What the hell? Oh no it's you. I want my lucky item. I get it. That's cool. Lunars stick between

332
00:45:26,969 --> 00:45:37,079
um runs and are quite useful. Um I'm trying to mark stuff with middle mouse. If you see something.

333
00:45:37,079 --> 00:45:46,500
Oh that's cool. Yeah the only reason why somebody told me that is because I looked over and I saw

334
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:59,349
oh my god Jeremy like 30 times. Personal shield. Did you get this? Use 30. So 3D printer. I marked you.

335
00:46:00,070 --> 00:46:04,010
So does the 3D printer can I just put something in there? How do I choose what item goes in or

336
00:46:04,010 --> 00:46:12,579
does it just show up there? Whatever it is. I have no idea. I just checked. All right I got a lot of

337
00:46:12,579 --> 00:46:17,909
bleed power now. Have we found the teleporter? Well I don't think we have. There's a lot of boxes though.

338
00:46:18,869 --> 00:46:29,340
I have no idea where it is. We probably should think about doing it though because we're about

339
00:46:29,340 --> 00:46:34,969
to move into hard. Yeah it's probably not a good idea. We're gonna move into hard difficult. Is it

340
00:46:34,969 --> 00:46:40,409
just it's just hidden somewhere. I don't know where you've been. I guess I do because all these

341
00:46:40,409 --> 00:46:46,820
boxes are open. It chooses an item that's the same color to exchange it. The teleporter has orange

342
00:46:46,820 --> 00:46:55,780
particles. Little heal but if you have 116 boxes a heal bot right here. I got it. Get two heal bots.

343
00:46:58,019 --> 00:47:00,739
All right let's we gotta find this teleporter. We're both gonna move into hard and then we're

344
00:47:00,739 --> 00:47:09,079
gonna get laughed at. What's this? I need one of these. The orange one I think is active items it

345
00:47:09,079 --> 00:47:15,880
is. Yeah it seems like it. Um look for orange particles floating up. I need like nine dollars

346
00:47:17,260 --> 00:47:29,289
taco lend me not money. I teleport where the fuck is it? Over here I see little particles.

347
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:34,860
There's a little like orange particles here. I got it. It's right here on me.

348
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:42,489
I'm going full boss killer mode. All right um should we do it? I guess we just punch it. I don't

349
00:47:42,489 --> 00:47:46,409
know I guess. Punch it let's go. Before it gets too hard. Before it gets too late. All right let's focus

350
00:47:46,409 --> 00:47:50,730
the boss. We're in a bit of a corner back against the wall. It's jellyfish too. We got this.

351
00:47:52,409 --> 00:47:58,539
Jellyfish sucks. We can kill this thing. It's too bad we have to look through the water to do it.

352
00:48:03,670 --> 00:48:09,429
Get rid of these guys first. They're kind of just causing a problem. Yeah I do so much boss damage.

353
00:48:09,429 --> 00:48:22,730
Here's full crits. Got it. He's dead. All right easy. Now wait wait wait wait there's like boss

354
00:48:22,730 --> 00:48:25,849
items here. I'm not gonna Diablo to you. I'm not gonna like kill bail. All right well you got the

355
00:48:25,849 --> 00:48:30,650
last two. I get these two. All right you. Oh but but but what about me? They're both mine. All right

356
00:48:30,650 --> 00:48:34,489
come on. I accidentally bailed you. You got the first two. That accident doesn't matter. We're even.

357
00:48:34,489 --> 00:48:38,489
We're square now. They're two bandoliers. I was the asshole that killed bail and everybody's

358
00:48:38,489 --> 00:48:45,510
computer freezes but that person somehow got to click first. Eye for an eye. Justice has been

359
00:48:45,510 --> 00:48:52,539
served. I have a chance on drop the reset cooldowns. It was always such bullshit because it was the

360
00:48:52,539 --> 00:48:57,179
audio loading his death animation and what would happen is you'd get some sorcerers that would come

361
00:48:57,179 --> 00:49:03,739
in and just melt the fuck out of him before he did his first line. My brother zoo will not die

362
00:49:03,739 --> 00:49:09,739
and it would load his second audio clip and crash everybody's computer and that one sorcerer's got

363
00:49:09,739 --> 00:49:20,230
to take everything. It was bullshit. They kill him before he got his fucking second line. All right

364
00:49:20,230 --> 00:49:25,429
do we have any more boxes or are we ready? Um there's probably boxes but we're in hard now.

365
00:49:25,909 --> 00:49:31,670
We are in hard yeah. The cusp of hard mode. You only knew this because you were the sorcerer. No

366
00:49:31,670 --> 00:49:40,179
I know this because I was the victim of a sorcerer. Why are they locked with like tendrils? It's money

367
00:49:40,179 --> 00:49:45,460
money money. Spend the money quick. Yeah but the the boxes were locked. They had like orange tendrils

368
00:49:45,460 --> 00:49:51,000
around them. All right we're going I'm going to teleport. What do you mean you're going to

369
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:55,559
teleport? What about the boxes? I'm entering the teleporter. Oh shit. Oh my money's all gone.

370
00:49:56,360 --> 00:50:07,380
I ran past three boxes. They're all locked. You can't loot because the teleporter's charging.

371
00:50:08,579 --> 00:50:13,059
Well everybody we were saying let's go get the boxes and we were both left the teleporter.

372
00:50:13,059 --> 00:50:20,070
Before you say anything man hold on I mean snow level pog. We're already halfway through hard.

373
00:50:24,969 --> 00:50:29,530
All right get that wasn't my decision. I didn't make that decision. He did.

374
00:50:30,250 --> 00:50:37,590
Whatever here comes the angry chat. Bring it on. I deal I deal with cross-eyed angry

375
00:50:37,590 --> 00:50:42,860
little people like you every day chat. You understand? Well tell me how you really feel.

376
00:50:46,679 --> 00:50:55,219
Give me your rage emojis. Okay they feed me. Dude pay attention to the game. Next to you I know

377
00:50:55,219 --> 00:51:02,380
you'll be talking about like lemon basil lemonade. God like focus. This is gonna hurt me. That's I

378
00:51:02,380 --> 00:51:09,670
don't like that. Return this game. I'm gonna refund it. It's been two hours. This thing has so much

379
00:51:09,670 --> 00:51:17,800
health. Look the only boxes we missed were active item boxes. Everything else has been looted

380
00:51:18,519 --> 00:51:22,329
because we're just too good at this game now. All right I can pick an item. I can pick either like

381
00:51:22,329 --> 00:51:38,329
baby lunchbox or bullets. Which one? I'm gonna do baby. Chance to block incoming damage. This

382
00:51:38,329 --> 00:51:48,940
thing's fucking crazy. These guys have a lot of health. Yeah they do. Oh he hits you from the top

383
00:51:48,940 --> 00:51:57,210
too. It's like balls and shit. We're yeah because we're on hard. We're about to be in very hard.

384
00:51:57,210 --> 00:52:03,289
Yeah we're just about to lose basically. Faster. All right okay fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck.

385
00:52:03,289 --> 00:52:08,980
Find the uh find the teleporter. We're about to get destroyed. It's also like ice enemies that

386
00:52:08,980 --> 00:52:18,139
slow you down and freeze you. I have so much money though hold on. Is there a box on the way?

387
00:52:18,139 --> 00:52:26,730
All right the particles are this way. Yep there's a teleporter right there. Taking damage all right.

388
00:52:27,610 --> 00:52:38,519
Um I don't know I mean it's wearing very hard. We gotta do it now. What's the hardest difficulty?

389
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:44,440
What is it? Does it cap or does it just keep going to like very very very very very hard?

390
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:49,769
I don't know. I think we could afford to get like one or two more boxes. I have like 500 bucks.

391
00:52:49,769 --> 00:53:01,239
It's a wood banner. What the fuck are you guys doing? Why is everybody laughing so hard? What are

392
00:53:01,239 --> 00:53:13,460
you doing? Everybody is laughing. Why? Um what is going on? They're just laughing preemptively

393
00:53:13,460 --> 00:53:18,019
because they expect us to die. Oh that's the name. The hardest difficulty is in all capitals.

394
00:53:18,019 --> 00:53:24,519
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. Oh I see. But apparently there's like 20 difficulties.

395
00:53:25,750 --> 00:53:30,789
This is so cool. Yeah now that we haven't like kept dying the third time in a row

396
00:53:32,099 --> 00:53:36,039
we're actually playing the game. I'm gonna hit every single one of those auto attacks.

397
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:41,500
Yes I just called it an auto attack and I'm sorry. Somebody's gonna be like what is this?

398
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:45,099
And then I gotta get my last hits in. All right I'm gonna I'm turning it on.

399
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:49,719
What? Should I turn this on or should we get more stuff? The teleporter?

400
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:55,320
Yeah. I'm pretty far away. Well just try to get a couple more boxes. We gotta

401
00:53:55,320 --> 00:54:03,420
we're in very hard now. They're being very greedy with the boxes this time.

402
00:54:03,980 --> 00:54:18,469
When do we unlock a new character? All right go ahead and turn on new stuff. Do we just buy it?

403
00:54:18,469 --> 00:54:30,630
Well at this point I would call this an item run because I don't see any more boxes around.

404
00:54:30,630 --> 00:54:40,519
There's like a money box. I almost just died to a default enemy. If you if we can complete this

405
00:54:40,519 --> 00:54:51,559
teleporter here we will unlock a new character. This is two thousand six hundred and sixty six

406
00:54:51,559 --> 00:54:57,739
dollars. It's gigantic. Do you have that kind of money? No I got nine hundred. Can we pool our

407
00:54:57,739 --> 00:55:04,980
money together somehow and buy this mega thing? Look at this drone man. That's two charges of

408
00:55:04,980 --> 00:55:21,050
your utility skill. That sounds kind of good. How much is this game? Nineteen dollars. That's

409
00:55:21,050 --> 00:55:25,690
pretty good. Twenty bucks. Nineteen ninety nine. Twenty dollars. This is also only the first

410
00:55:25,690 --> 00:55:29,289
character. There's like six total characters in the early access right now. All right we gotta

411
00:55:29,289 --> 00:55:34,019
go turn the teleporter on. There's no more boxes here. Holy shit I can do that twice. All right

412
00:55:34,019 --> 00:55:37,539
let's go let's go fight. Unless you want to grind another like thousand dollars and get the super

413
00:55:37,539 --> 00:55:44,869
drone. I apparently I get this is cool. All right let's go. Let's we gotta turn it on otherwise

414
00:55:44,869 --> 00:56:02,440
it's gonna get too super hard. It's on consoles at all or just PC. I don't know. I have a triple roll.

415
00:56:02,519 --> 00:56:10,579
Wow. All right let's do it. Oh boy. Yep. I just rolled off the edge. No I didn't. Thank god.

416
00:56:13,159 --> 00:56:21,110
Uh we got like a lava worm on the ice level. Is that the boss? I don't know but I'm trying

417
00:56:21,110 --> 00:56:24,550
to like clear. We all right I don't know. Yeah it's the worm is like flying around.

418
00:56:27,659 --> 00:56:38,889
God there's so many fucking enemies here. Oh dear. He's just flying around. Oh my I'm gonna die.

419
00:56:41,110 --> 00:56:47,190
Oh there's too many enemies. Are you all right? I'm gonna bring my drone over to you.

420
00:56:48,250 --> 00:56:54,119
My drone just found me finally. This week is gonna last.

421
00:56:54,920 --> 00:57:12,039
Whoa. This is not a race. Oh you're right on top of me. Oh god. Uh what are we at?

422
00:57:12,679 --> 00:57:24,059
59 percent. Ow. My drone can't heal fast enough. There's too many people. Uh there's so many.

423
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:58,460
74. Uh so many heads. 89. No. 94. I got it. All right we got it. We got it. All right he's

424
00:57:58,460 --> 00:58:06,969
doing like a third. Enemies no longer spawn. All right so focus on the adds then. Yeah. Oh my god.

425
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:19,860
I'm dead. Are you? Oh yeah. I died inside this. You can do it. I will try. There is nowhere for me

426
00:58:19,860 --> 00:58:37,480
to go. All right I think we're good. Almost. Do you choose who's rockets or is it just a random

427
00:58:37,480 --> 00:59:02,440
chance? I think it's random. Wee. All right you got this. Uh this is fucking crazy. I missed every

428
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:06,920
shot. Stupid idiot. Sorry. Because you can't look straight up. I know it's true. I just figured that

429
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:17,929
out right now. Oh my god. Wow three rolls. Yeah. I am very jealous of that. That's like huge

430
00:59:17,929 --> 00:59:28,570
survivability. I know it's great. There we go. See you later. We did it. How do I revive you? Oh

431
00:59:28,570 --> 00:59:35,260
two guitars. You get both the guitars and then I come back. You get both of them yeah. His music

432
00:59:35,260 --> 00:59:45,619
was electric. Wow all right so should I just pick up stuff or should we just go? Um up to you I guess.

433
00:59:45,619 --> 00:59:48,099
Uh let me just see. There's something in the vicinity. There's something right here. Let me

434
00:59:48,099 --> 00:59:57,690
just get this and we'll go. There's a couple things here. Let me just pick it up. That's a

435
00:59:57,769 --> 01:00:05,130
heel thing. What's this? I haven't really noticed the uh med kit working. Yeah it's weird. Sprint

436
01:00:05,130 --> 01:00:13,369
faster. Can I buy more than one? No. All right there's a couple blocks this way. I wish we

437
01:00:13,369 --> 01:00:18,900
would have found this cave before we uh. Yeah seriously. Because I think we both went in with

438
01:00:18,900 --> 01:00:25,260
like a thousand bucks. Yeah all right after I get to the top here I'm just gonna drop down.

439
01:00:26,519 --> 01:00:31,559
Yes guys I know I won't get the third. The character unlock. Too bad I'm never gonna play.

440
01:00:31,559 --> 01:00:35,320
Yeah apparently you only get it if you kill that enemy but it's too bad I'm never gonna play this

441
01:00:35,320 --> 01:00:40,039
game again so I'll never get another chance to unlock it. You don't you don't unlock that even

442
01:00:40,039 --> 01:00:44,619
if you're in like the party. All right I'm just gonna. Apparently yeah I guess I'm just uninstalling

443
01:00:44,619 --> 01:00:53,510
when we die. But what an uninstallable what an uninstallatable game you know what I mean?

444
01:00:53,510 --> 01:01:01,699
Did you know if you die after the third level both of us the game uninstalls itself. That's what

445
01:01:01,699 --> 01:01:06,650
people in chat are saying. It's so like. And you never get to play it again. It's so relatable to

446
01:01:06,650 --> 01:01:15,909
uninstall it. It's an uns. I don't even know what the word I just said was. Well let's just go. This

447
01:01:15,909 --> 01:01:31,500
is like our first real run might as well just go uninstallable. There it is. All right so um for my

448
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:38,150
chat I want you to notice the different look press tab and just look at the itemization there.

449
01:01:38,150 --> 01:01:46,809
Yeah what about it. Look how many more. Well I still. You've got than me. Yeah well it's called

450
01:01:47,690 --> 01:01:53,610
I've been I've been buying only two of those items that were illegal items that I got for free. You

451
01:01:53,610 --> 01:01:59,369
also got two items. I wasn't making any accusations. I was just merely pointing out. I feel there's a

452
01:01:59,369 --> 01:02:05,050
dramatic difference there. You got two free boss items. Remember I. Yeah I'm not complaining. I'm

453
01:02:05,050 --> 01:02:11,289
just saying I think it's funny. That's it. Oh yeah I just think it's funny. Yeah I'm just like

454
01:02:11,289 --> 01:02:14,969
want to point out. I think it's like kind of. Listen what would my complaint be. I'm not saying

455
01:02:14,969 --> 01:02:22,940
you're like sniping items. I'm saying that you've just got a lot more. I'm just kidding. But I mean

456
01:02:24,059 --> 01:02:29,619
if I had to point any fingers I'm just kidding. See now it comes out. Well guys all this takes

457
01:02:29,619 --> 01:02:40,619
is time. All it takes is like a few minutes of prodding and you'll get it out. Whoa these jump

458
01:02:40,619 --> 01:02:46,869
pads go. This is a very vertical level here. How do you dodge that shit. Just to run away. He's

459
01:02:46,869 --> 01:02:55,099
gonna do it again. This level looks crazy. Yeah when he does the big laser beam dude you have to

460
01:02:55,099 --> 01:03:07,559
just line aside something. Oh yeah. I'm gonna die to a normal boss. Something behind me.

461
01:03:07,559 --> 01:03:17,159
Yeah this is just like a random like elite enemy huh. We're on impossible difficulty now by the

462
01:03:17,159 --> 01:03:27,769
way. Yeah we are. That's why it takes so long to kill one person. All right do I have enough money

463
01:03:27,769 --> 01:03:40,389
to buy shit. A mask. I can summon a ghost if I kill something. It's like some Luigi's Mansion music.

464
01:03:43,500 --> 01:03:54,679
I like it. Another huge guy. Oh that's one of my ghosts. Okay I get it. Where's the big dude.

465
01:03:56,619 --> 01:04:17,210
Down here. Whoa. Watch out for that shit. I need this. My god they're everywhere. Yeah I'm pretty

466
01:04:17,210 --> 01:04:25,480
much just gonna die to regular like elites at that moment. Very very high health. I'll be happy if

467
01:04:25,480 --> 01:04:34,280
we can take this guy down. Uh oh I just prayed to the shrine of combat. It was a huge mistake.

468
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:40,119
Chance to stun on hit. Come to me quickly. Oh you. Oh my god. Yes right now. I'm coming I'm coming

469
01:04:40,119 --> 01:04:46,780
I'm coming I'm coming I'm coming. What do you need. I just need you to shoot everyone behind me.

470
01:04:46,780 --> 01:04:57,590
Okay. Oh god. We have like two mini bosses here. Should I not have done that. I just pressed it.

471
01:04:57,590 --> 01:05:04,949
Oh no. Oculus HD HUD. Oh wait did I just press it. Okay I you know. Okay I get it. I go. Oh my god

472
01:05:04,949 --> 01:05:18,090
we're dead. Well it was fun. It was fun. That was good. Well yeah hold on. I was out of my element

473
01:05:18,090 --> 01:05:27,500
there. I'm not dead yet. Yet. Minus a hundred and three health is what I ended with. Oh god I'm dead.

474
01:05:27,500 --> 01:05:33,590
Yeah well that was a good one. So today I learned praying to the shrine of combat is a challenge

475
01:05:36,780 --> 01:05:42,139
and if you pray to it you must be prepared for the elite summons. All right so we unlock stuff.

476
01:05:43,860 --> 01:05:50,630
Monster lock. Beetle. This item will now randomly appear in the runs. Advancement. This item. So we

477
01:05:50,630 --> 01:06:01,289
unlocked a few more items. Elder Lemurians. Cool. Cool. All right so to be honest the commando kind

478
01:06:01,289 --> 01:06:07,320
of sucks. Well he is the starter character so. This is cool. That's that's what I've got. Now

479
01:06:07,320 --> 01:06:14,070
there's the huntress behind me. Yeah so there's a stray fire seeking arrow for 150 damage can be

480
01:06:14,070 --> 01:06:23,110
used while sprinting. Laser glaive. Glaive that bounces six times. Damage increased by 10 percent

481
01:06:23,110 --> 01:06:39,829
per bounce. Instead of a dodge it's a blink. And then arrow rain. Cool. All right I got I mean

482
01:06:40,389 --> 01:06:52,809
I got I'll try it. It's Freudian's birthday today. Happy birthday happy birthday Freudian.

483
01:06:53,369 --> 01:07:07,769
So this is like a bow and arrow. I'm so ready for this. You've got different powers now. Yeah.

484
01:07:08,409 --> 01:07:13,769
You got unique abilities. What's your uh basic attack obviously at the bow but I wonder

485
01:07:13,769 --> 01:07:18,489
I think everyone's basic attack is different. Let's find out and maybe it's not a burst fire

486
01:07:18,489 --> 01:07:34,420
maybe it's just one shot. It is. Is this like EDF? Yes. Um what it's a homing shot. It it really

487
01:07:34,420 --> 01:07:38,340
is just you get aimbot. You just do you have aimbot now. You just have to put the cursor

488
01:07:38,340 --> 01:07:44,570
somewhere near them and then press the button. That's pretty awesome. Uh yeah I give me. Is it

489
01:07:44,570 --> 01:07:50,329
like weaker shots to compensate I guess probably. Well you shoot it's less. It's like one two three

490
01:07:50,329 --> 01:08:00,659
instead of like no me. All right we understand what's going on here. Let's get it going.

491
01:08:01,219 --> 01:08:13,429
It's like the glaive right? Cool. Now what does this do? Whoa rain of arrows. That looks sweet.

492
01:08:13,429 --> 01:08:23,720
That's the dodge. That goes a long way. All right let's open up some boxes. Well here's the um

493
01:08:23,720 --> 01:08:37,560
teleporter. What do I get? Rubik's cube. I feel like I'm getting the same power-ups. Uh the range

494
01:08:37,560 --> 01:08:42,520
though. Here's the thing about I cannot physically shoot a the weapon if somebody's not like in

495
01:08:42,520 --> 01:08:49,380
range. Oh really? Yeah they have to be like within range to hit them. That was that box.

496
01:08:50,420 --> 01:08:55,319
I already got that one. Where's the other one? I was standing right next to it. Oh no that's just a

497
01:08:55,319 --> 01:09:17,060
jump. RNG baby. See I have the same loadout. All right um cool. All right boxes I need open. 55.

498
01:09:17,060 --> 01:09:25,189
That is a gunner drone. Oh you can sprint while shooting too. That's cool. Oh that is pretty

499
01:09:25,189 --> 01:09:28,470
handy. Where are these glasses? Which one of these do I want? Give me this one.

500
01:09:29,350 --> 01:09:38,840
Healing orb on kill. All right what do you think? You can blink up too. Well that's kind of insane.

501
01:09:39,479 --> 01:09:52,710
You ready to start this? Um I guess so. Let's get this party started. Hold on I'm running towards you

502
01:09:52,710 --> 01:10:08,970
pretty far away. Coming back into the fray. It's a beetle queen. Need more money.

503
01:10:09,770 --> 01:10:27,319
Wow that hurt. All right where's the boss? Oh there it is. Back here. So bugs are bad. Bugs are bad.

504
01:10:28,949 --> 01:10:39,640
Oops how far does this go? It goes pretty far actually. How much damage does my little piercing

505
01:10:39,640 --> 01:10:53,640
shot do? 44. Nice. That's pretty good. Can you believe we died on this level? Yeah well we didn't

506
01:10:53,640 --> 01:11:00,069
know what the hell was going on. Yeah but like now it seems like a foreign concept. I don't

507
01:11:00,069 --> 01:11:05,270
understand how because I feel like I'm not trying. I picked up one boss item. All right you get the

508
01:11:05,270 --> 01:11:10,310
other one. But you also remember like we just installed the game. Yeah we did just install it.

509
01:11:11,109 --> 01:11:17,800
It's an onion. Beetle guard. All right box time. We have plenty of time. We're still in easy. Is

510
01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:23,159
this your friend? I don't is this your guy? I have like a beetle friend. What? Yeah it was one of the

511
01:11:23,640 --> 01:11:29,689
boss items. All right can he die? He's doing like aoe like he's a third character.

512
01:11:31,609 --> 01:11:42,409
All right 148 bucks. If you have the money. I keep shooting him thinking he's a bad guy.

513
01:11:43,289 --> 01:11:52,090
Resets cooldowns. Yeah if you hold tab you can mouse over the items too. There's another. I've

514
01:11:52,090 --> 01:11:57,050
got a healing drone now. Those are so useful. Healing drones are so good. What about one of

515
01:11:57,050 --> 01:12:02,899
these like shrines? Reactivate it. Which one? There's one down here. I don't have enough money

516
01:12:02,899 --> 01:12:13,319
to do that now. Yeah I do. I don't know where to go from what boxes. What is purple money? I don't

517
01:12:13,319 --> 01:12:22,760
think we have purple money yet. All right I'm ready to teleport. Hold on. I still have 160 dollars.

518
01:12:22,760 --> 01:12:31,479
Whenever you're ready. I don't want to 3D print this. That's an RNG shrine not an item shrine.

519
01:12:31,479 --> 01:12:42,119
Cool. Good to know. Oh is it changing my items into med kits? Oh that's what that does. Oh I'm

520
01:12:42,119 --> 01:12:47,640
changing my I'm changing my good items into the worst item in the game. I see. Uh oh. Yeah I like

521
01:12:47,640 --> 01:12:54,869
the extra challenge. Ready to rock and roll. I had no idea of what that machine does. Gamble from stuff

522
01:12:54,869 --> 01:13:06,420
at that shrine. All right time's ticking. You ready? Hold on. I'm gambling. Easy easy. I'm gambling.

523
01:13:06,979 --> 01:13:17,430
I got an evil teddy. Dio's best friend. Tie the clock. We're gonna get to be 75 years old when

524
01:13:17,430 --> 01:13:26,500
I get to hard. All right. Go go go go. It's about facing your fears and racing the time. I get to

525
01:13:26,579 --> 01:13:46,699
come back to life once. I have a cheat def. Nice. Activate. Oh nice. Here we go. I can see why

526
01:13:46,699 --> 01:13:51,300
people think this is really fun. This is just like. You can see why but you don't think so personally?

527
01:13:51,300 --> 01:14:05,609
No. Yeah I agree. No. I'm joking. I think it's fun. Oh well I just kill stole you. Sorry. Sorry

528
01:14:05,609 --> 01:14:12,569
Gab. What was his name? Gab. What was his name? Bring back smite. Yeah. No Jeb. That was what it

529
01:14:12,569 --> 01:14:32,060
was. All right. Do I have money? I have money. Let's buy some stuff. So what was my other item

530
01:14:32,060 --> 01:14:37,579
that I got besides the teddy? You can attack speed up. All right there's a lunar item here

531
01:14:37,579 --> 01:14:41,930
on this part of the level. All right come on. I gotta hurry up. It's all about speed.

532
01:14:42,649 --> 01:14:54,859
There's too many places to go. There's too many things to see. Okay there's another one of these.

533
01:14:54,859 --> 01:15:14,329
Chance to bleed again. It's a gab bush. Jeb down. What's a safe way to get down without dying of

534
01:15:14,329 --> 01:15:20,729
fall damage? I think you can dodge right before. Really? That's what somebody. I think I may have

535
01:15:20,729 --> 01:15:25,850
just accidentally read that in chat and I think. No it's true. It is right? Yeah it works. I got

536
01:15:25,850 --> 01:15:41,180
knowledge. Sometimes. Thanks taco. Enough money to buy this? Yes. What did you drop? Did he just drop

537
01:15:41,180 --> 01:15:53,300
a box? Or is that just here? All right we're in medium now. That is the way I like my cheeseburgers.

538
01:15:57,210 --> 01:16:02,890
This is not this was not wise what I just did. I just got two med kits. Look away chat. I thought

539
01:16:02,890 --> 01:16:09,800
I could move. All right we gotta find teleported. I'm spending too much time here. Listen. I looked

540
01:16:09,800 --> 01:16:14,600
over the chat and it was just like you guys are fucking idiots. Stupid fucking morons. Like hurry

541
01:16:14,600 --> 01:16:25,880
the fuck up. Like it's all I see in the chat. It's kind of like crazy. Like they specifically

542
01:16:25,880 --> 01:16:31,020
keep calling out you in particular. They keep going like italics. God damn it. And like they

543
01:16:31,020 --> 01:16:37,319
capitalize the damn it. So it's like really like emphasized and rude. Good tell them to say it to

544
01:16:37,319 --> 01:16:45,699
my face. Oh shit that's the wrong chat. Sorry. I was in your chat. Sorry. Oh that makes more sense.

545
01:16:48,760 --> 01:16:56,739
Like I'm just in your chat. That's reasonable now. Not as far fetched as it once was.

546
01:16:57,220 --> 01:17:11,609
Do you have you found the teleporter yet? No. Oh I'm trying either. Look for the orange sprinkled.

547
01:17:14,859 --> 01:17:25,029
The orange sprinkled dust. Yeah there's a lot of items down here. What is this? What's this moon?

548
01:17:25,029 --> 01:17:30,470
What's the moon thing mean? You see that too right? The moon? It's got a question mark.

549
01:17:32,069 --> 01:17:44,199
Offer to shrine of blood lose 50% HP. No. You do that. What did it do? It didn't do anything.

550
01:17:48,149 --> 01:17:52,069
It gives you money. If I do it it's 75%. Oh shit I got money. Okay it gives you money.

551
01:17:53,829 --> 01:17:58,069
So like do you get your health back or is it permanently gone? No I have 279 HP.

552
01:17:58,869 --> 01:18:07,180
So if I do it I'm not going to. Whatever I'll do it. Yeah you get 100 and you get gold. Turret

553
01:18:07,180 --> 01:18:20,220
down here. Um 3d print this. I like that. What about this? He's helping it. All right I need to find

554
01:18:20,220 --> 01:18:25,260
more boxes. Come over here I got something for you. Oh I got the rope. We're gonna have to get

555
01:18:25,260 --> 01:18:35,109
over here. We can both have a rubik's cube. Okay. Right there. This? Yeah get it. It's inactive.

556
01:18:37,500 --> 01:18:42,380
But I have eight seconds of crit so which one's better? Oh shit I don't know. Maybe I should take

557
01:18:42,380 --> 01:18:47,430
them both. Yeah I don't think I can carry both. All right we gotta activate this. I gotta find a

558
01:18:47,430 --> 01:18:59,640
fucking teleporter. Is crowbar good? Uh yeah I think so. Does it take a random item in the 3d

559
01:18:59,640 --> 01:19:07,659
printer? I still don't understand how that works to change to the thing or. I'm sure we'll figure

560
01:19:07,659 --> 01:19:18,869
it out. Takes a random one. What is it? I think it's first in line on the left. It's slow. I would

561
01:19:18,869 --> 01:19:27,130
lose my shield. What is this? Another fucking cube. I already have one of these. Have we even found the

562
01:19:27,130 --> 01:19:31,930
teleporter? It's gotta be up. It's a random item. We're almost in heart. Random item of the same

563
01:19:31,930 --> 01:19:42,069
tier. Yeah we're spending way too much time here. Random item of the same tier. Printers take random

564
01:19:42,069 --> 01:19:51,720
items of the same rarity. Preferring duplicates. And it's a random item of the same tier. What's

565
01:19:51,720 --> 01:19:59,670
this one? Stun grenade. There's no order to it. It's just random. Good to know. Uh where is this

566
01:19:59,670 --> 01:20:07,539
teleporter? Good to know. Where is this teleporter? Turn invisible. I'm taking heavy damage. That's

567
01:20:07,539 --> 01:20:19,369
cool. It has to be right. It has to be up. It's gotta be. Yeah it's gotta be like on one of these

568
01:20:19,369 --> 01:20:26,010
platforms somewhere. It's over there where I'm pointing. Where? Point at the screen. Point?

569
01:20:27,130 --> 01:20:29,770
Just draw a line with your finger. You guys like. With your greasy fingers.

570
01:20:30,649 --> 01:20:37,050
And like cosmic knowledge. You know what I mean? Like if every single one of you there's like

571
01:20:37,050 --> 01:20:46,920
there's like what? 3,000 people here. 3,500 something like that. Total. If all of you point

572
01:20:46,920 --> 01:20:51,880
at the same part of the screen. Like will I sense it? Because like we have to have the heat map on

573
01:20:51,880 --> 01:21:02,340
for that. You have to turn the heat map on right now. Turn on smart click. Yeah that is what it

574
01:21:02,340 --> 01:21:19,020
would be. Uh is it down here? I think I see it. Uh I don't I don't know. I haven't seen any orange

575
01:21:19,020 --> 01:21:29,060
sparkles. Down here? It's down there. Maybe maybe maybe. Oh come on. We actually missed it. Is this

576
01:21:29,060 --> 01:21:34,659
bugged? Fail the shrine of chance three times in a row. We missed it. We went down here already.

577
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:46,729
It's not a nice achievement that I just got. Any other items and boxes and shit down here?

578
01:21:47,289 --> 01:21:49,989
I gotta we gotta turn this on man. We're gonna be in hard.

579
01:21:52,409 --> 01:21:59,909
Four in a row? Come on. Is this bugged? Did you get that achievement? No you did. Yeah I got it um

580
01:21:59,909 --> 01:22:04,550
for that. I activated the shrine of chance and failed four times in a row. I lost three hundred

581
01:22:04,550 --> 01:22:13,130
dollars. I just went to the casino and then came back to the stream. I have so many little drones

582
01:22:13,130 --> 01:22:20,520
everywhere. A coin. What? A coin? Coins? A coin. All right you ready? Wait wait wait. Literally a

583
01:22:20,520 --> 01:22:29,399
coin. Where? Get the coin. What I what do you mean coin? Where's the coin? Do you see a coin?

584
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:36,600
If I did what I tell you I would just take it. Is that it? All right I found it. Oh there is a coin.

585
01:22:36,600 --> 01:22:44,899
There is like a giant blue coin. Yeah there's a coin right there. Oh did I get it? Does this

586
01:22:44,899 --> 01:22:54,470
travel with us? Uh Tanner whatever your name is. Tano taco. Do I have to spend this here?

587
01:22:55,029 --> 01:23:02,279
All right we're gonna turn this on man. This is gonna be we're gonna get overwhelmed.

588
01:23:02,279 --> 01:23:10,979
Well what are you waiting for? I just turned it on. What is it?

589
01:23:10,979 --> 01:23:19,399
Beetle queen. Oh the beetle queen. Is this dumb thing? That's a ride. Where? I don't know. Beetle

590
01:23:19,399 --> 01:23:27,800
queen. Maybe she can't fit down here. Anybody see a beetle queen? Keep shooting your stupid companion.

591
01:23:28,439 --> 01:23:38,619
Oh she's back here. It's a very nice companion though. Don't be mean to my companion. Don't worry.

592
01:23:39,880 --> 01:23:43,479
Okay I won't. I just I forgot this is not a dodge roll. I just may have just killed myself. To be

593
01:23:43,479 --> 01:24:00,619
fair though your companion is blocking my permacritz. All right what we got? What do we

594
01:24:00,619 --> 01:24:08,890
got for items? Uh I don't even see any. A couple over here. There's one. There's a green and a

595
01:24:08,890 --> 01:24:12,569
I'll take this one. All right I'll take this one. This is another jump right? I want my own beetle

596
01:24:12,569 --> 01:24:21,539
guard. Yeah we're gonna have two beetles. So that's good 74 percent. I keep forgetting I have an extra

597
01:24:21,539 --> 01:24:32,600
jump already. You have to scream for crits like Mike activated. Beetle queen is so easy compared

598
01:24:32,600 --> 01:24:36,420
to others. All right well we'll have a second. Is there anything else to open down here?

599
01:24:37,220 --> 01:24:57,350
Something else. Come on. I don't think there is. Nothing nothing nothing nothing nothing nothing.

600
01:25:02,869 --> 01:25:10,779
Are you at the teleporter? Hey you can do a 93 percent HP. I dare you. What? That uh blood

601
01:25:10,779 --> 01:25:14,300
pact. Yeah but we don't have any money to spend. I mean we don't have any. I have 500 bucks I don't

602
01:25:14,300 --> 01:25:23,020
know where to spend it. Yeah this box is maybe something down here. These are all open. They'd

603
01:25:23,020 --> 01:25:33,899
probably be the ones like elevated ones higher up. Just turns into XP. Yeah let's just do it.

604
01:25:33,899 --> 01:25:41,210
We're we gotta try to get through the next thing before it gets it very hard. Back to it. Do the

605
01:25:41,210 --> 01:25:52,329
shrine. Didn't do chance shrine. No I didn't. Yeah I can't spend any of this money. We gotta go.

606
01:25:55,720 --> 01:26:04,090
Yeah we have to get out of here. We really do. On my way. Chance shrines are good. We'll do it next

607
01:26:04,090 --> 01:26:16,489
time. Chance shrine is always worth it. Well that does not feel good but. Do it now. We'll do it

608
01:26:16,489 --> 01:26:26,710
next time. We'll do well I'll do it tomorrow. All right this is where we got one more after this

609
01:26:26,710 --> 01:26:32,600
right and we died on that one. We got we were insane at that point. Let's really try to clean

610
01:26:32,600 --> 01:27:00,020
this up. That hurts. Dear. So the levels increase base stats I assume. Uh I it looks like it yeah.

611
01:27:00,819 --> 01:27:15,720
Okay items. It's always like a dollar away. I don't I don't know what that is. Why am I shooting him?

612
01:27:15,720 --> 01:27:24,760
He's my friend. What is this? Fungus heal all nearby allies after standing still for two seconds.

613
01:27:26,810 --> 01:27:31,130
I had that one earlier and didn't use it one time. Everyone said it sucked so I just. That's

614
01:27:31,130 --> 01:27:46,630
unfortunate. But I thought oh well. That's too many. What is what is this what's why does this

615
01:27:46,630 --> 01:27:54,539
have a broken clock on it? 9 59. Somebody unplugged their VCR. What does that mean?

616
01:28:01,640 --> 01:28:11,239
There's my friends. You need to get to this level before 10 minutes. Oh enemies on hit. There we go.

617
01:28:11,239 --> 01:28:16,920
What is this thing? Why is it only 60 bucks? Is this like a Amazon drone? What is this? That was

618
01:28:16,920 --> 01:28:25,510
that's crazy. 15 minutes on multiplayer. Oh it's like a booster. All right I'm looking for one of

619
01:28:25,510 --> 01:28:35,609
those lunar boxes. So you can spend your lunar coin? Yeah I mean first time we've ever had it.

620
01:28:35,609 --> 01:28:41,579
Might as well see what it is. I was thinking about maybe giving it to you. I was thinking about

621
01:28:41,579 --> 01:29:00,840
gasoline. Well you shouldn't have. This is hurting me bad. Okay they're really keen on the bandolier

622
01:29:00,840 --> 01:29:09,800
right now. Wait save coins for a new character. I found the uh teleporter. Wait you mean that

623
01:29:09,800 --> 01:29:17,079
currency stays forever? Yeah this the currency stays forever. Forever. Forever. What the fuck?

624
01:29:17,079 --> 01:29:29,500
Okay that's good to know. I hope you're enjoying my scarab friend down there. I assume he earns me

625
01:29:29,500 --> 01:29:42,460
money actually. Yeah I think so. That's pretty awesome. All right give me some boxes. We might

626
01:29:42,460 --> 01:29:56,699
consider turning it on here in a minute. I got the stupid heal thing again. And 316 bucks. Should

627
01:29:56,699 --> 01:30:06,340
I pick the missile launcher or the cube? Missile launcher. I'm talking about actives. Probably the

628
01:30:06,340 --> 01:30:17,850
cube. Yeah it's kind of nice having the black hole for crowd control stuff. Yeah it is. Chance. Oh

629
01:30:17,850 --> 01:30:26,060
I got the happy mask too. You have that? Oh I had it last time. It was pretty good. Chance to bleed.

630
01:30:26,060 --> 01:30:35,050
I have a couple of these don't I? How many of these do I have? Two. All right partner what do you say?

631
01:30:35,529 --> 01:30:42,710
Yeah I think it's pretty much go time. You're kind of far away though. Yeah I'm coming back.

632
01:30:57,300 --> 01:31:01,460
All right might as well uh turn it on. I got dibs on this chest real quick.

633
01:31:01,460 --> 01:31:09,210
This chest real quick. I just need like 30 more bucks. Why not? Just I'll just open it for you.

634
01:31:09,850 --> 01:31:20,630
Here take it. Oh let's go. I'm like hurt. I'm gonna use this now like I'm fucking I'm actually

635
01:31:20,630 --> 01:31:28,069
hurt. I need to like not die. All right what is it? Clay dune. It's a big machine. Oh they were all

636
01:31:28,069 --> 01:31:36,340
grouped up for that. I love it. Did you say that is the bomb? It was great. Just keep doing that shit.

637
01:31:37,140 --> 01:31:59,130
So he's he's in the air. I don't know what that means. I'm pretty much just focusing the boss

638
01:31:59,130 --> 01:32:16,789
right now but also dying. Oh my god. Whoa. Oh there's more than one. He's split. He's just pulling

639
01:32:16,789 --> 01:32:30,119
us in. Can I can we out range that? He's got like um mechanite tendrils. All right one dead.

640
01:32:30,840 --> 01:32:35,079
One down. Oh my god why'd I do that? I didn't mean to do that. I'm just gonna stand still.

641
01:32:35,880 --> 01:32:41,560
Are you getting healed? I am getting healed by also my own body. All right I'm gonna come over

642
01:32:41,560 --> 01:32:49,510
here. Let's see what this does. Stand in that circle and how good is the heal? It's like actually

643
01:32:49,510 --> 01:33:06,199
worth doing. Uh I don't know. Oh probably not. No. Well that item is um questionable at best.

644
01:33:06,840 --> 01:33:14,779
Stand still for two seconds. You got this. You're doing good. You're doing great. You're doing

645
01:33:14,779 --> 01:33:33,100
great. Is that like 10 percent? 15 percent? Come on dots dots dots dots man. Four percent. Two percent.

646
01:33:33,819 --> 01:33:41,609
Hit it hard. Hit it hard. Cool downs. Warrior. Hey my turn to get the achievement. All right

647
01:33:41,609 --> 01:33:50,119
these look the same so I'll take one. The fungus is nicely done for out of combat. That makes sense.

648
01:33:53,210 --> 01:34:01,100
Why is he still alive? I don't know. Good question. You can take both. You can take both since you're

649
01:34:01,100 --> 01:34:10,359
dead. I'm dead. Take them both. You're dead? Yeah I'm dead. Wait when did you die? Uh when I screamed.

650
01:34:10,439 --> 01:34:15,819
Remember I was like let me try this. Let me stand still for two seconds and I was like

651
01:34:15,819 --> 01:34:19,579
you getting healed by that? I instantly died and the meteor hit me in the head and killed me.

652
01:34:19,579 --> 01:34:24,859
Oh okay well let's I have 1400 bucks but I don't have anything to spend it on because I searched

653
01:34:24,859 --> 01:34:32,699
this whole area for boxes first. So let's just go. If you got the cash then spend it. There was

654
01:34:32,699 --> 01:34:37,260
nothing to spend. All right well we're good. All right this is where we got to last time and I'm

655
01:34:37,260 --> 01:34:44,460
already halfway dead. We are now on impossible. There's a weird is a hard balance here with

656
01:34:44,460 --> 01:34:53,289
trying to pick up items and going quickly. It's cool. I'm oh yeah I don't know man we might have

657
01:34:53,289 --> 01:35:00,550
taken too long. Yeah but probably I mean I'm fighting like a boss as a normal enemy. This is

658
01:35:00,550 --> 01:35:07,770
our wall right now. This is our like newbie wall. Going quickly is way more important. Yeah

659
01:35:10,760 --> 01:35:16,359
we got we got mechanics down pretty closely now. We should probably just try and do a uh

660
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:27,829
like a speedy speedy run to the first two areas. Oh my god. Yeah there's like a dinosaur boss in

661
01:35:27,829 --> 01:35:43,220
here. That is who has been pursuing me. Slowed. The inability to shoot straight up is very annoying

662
01:35:43,220 --> 01:35:54,119
against that guy and there's some kind of turtle guy. The 10-minute chest is a weird item. Also

663
01:35:54,119 --> 01:36:01,579
Geb is useless right here. Geb does not know how to path find. I'm dead. I think I caught fire.

664
01:36:01,579 --> 01:36:09,750
You dead? I'm alive again though because I had an item. So that's pretty cool. Okay this that giant

665
01:36:09,750 --> 01:36:18,550
snake thing is around. How do you stop burning to death? Roll. Like every video game right? That's

666
01:36:18,550 --> 01:36:23,909
what I think but it didn't seem to be doing anything. Well that's really great. Wish I had

667
01:36:23,909 --> 01:36:32,699
that earlier. I can dash twice three times probably. All right we're just like circling

668
01:36:32,699 --> 01:36:37,659
everybody and just killing enemies. Oh we're so fucked. I'm trying to kill this one like lizard.

669
01:36:37,659 --> 01:36:52,229
The fire lizard. We're so dead. All right looking for the teleporter. He's dead. That was big money.

670
01:36:52,229 --> 01:37:06,140
Big money. Uh orange flakes. I don't see any orange flakes over here. Wait I see an orange

671
01:37:06,140 --> 01:37:11,270
flake right there. Orange flakes. All right I got it. It's down here. We're going from impossible

672
01:37:11,270 --> 01:37:18,279
to I see something. I see dead people right. Teleport is right here. Should I just turn it on?

673
01:37:19,319 --> 01:37:26,149
Um I'm not gonna tell you not to because I just don't know. Well here. I'm gonna die with that

674
01:37:26,149 --> 01:37:44,600
with or without it. So apparently I'm missile guide now. Maybe we'll get lucky. All right you're

675
01:37:44,600 --> 01:37:54,600
ready. I'm just gonna turn it on. Who is it? Imp Overlord. Imp Overlord. All right I'm coming to

676
01:37:54,600 --> 01:37:57,640
you. Thank you. No I thought he's coming to you. All right he's doesn't have that much health.

677
01:37:58,520 --> 01:38:05,819
He's pretty weak. Just burn him. Hold on I'm not I'm not even I can't even see him. So I'm coming.

678
01:38:06,539 --> 01:38:20,710
I'm on my way. Yeah I am super jump missile guy now. All right I'm helping. Where's he going?

679
01:38:20,789 --> 01:38:32,119
He's invisible. Ah cancelled it. I think we're gonna do this. Uh he's he's focused on me now

680
01:38:33,800 --> 01:38:50,890
and here he comes. We cleaned up a lot of enemies there. Just watch. So he's intangible while

681
01:38:50,890 --> 01:39:10,100
invisible and cannot be heard. All right we got a lot of enemies coming in. Big skull man. The boss

682
01:39:10,100 --> 01:39:15,899
he's almost he's at like less than a quarter. I'm about to go full crit. Oh and he just went

683
01:39:15,899 --> 01:39:19,500
invisible. I'm trying to take care of the adds. There's so many of them coming in. They all found

684
01:39:19,500 --> 01:39:27,460
us at the same time. We got it. Kill him. He's almost dead. Yes. All right clean this up.

685
01:39:28,180 --> 01:39:38,789
We're good. 97 percent. Uh shrine of the mountain. Someone was like wait till they

686
01:39:38,789 --> 01:39:42,229
pray to the shrine of the mountain earlier. So I'm gonna wait until we're done to like press

687
01:39:42,229 --> 01:39:46,789
that button. All right so that's good. You're not gonna debate me that easily. I see you. All right

688
01:39:46,789 --> 01:39:51,850
I'm gonna get this one. You get the other one. So uh we can move on. Do you want to pray to the

689
01:39:51,850 --> 01:39:57,609
shrine of the mountain and possibly die. Um somebody said it won't work now.

690
01:39:58,409 --> 01:40:01,050
It won't do anything now. Well then I can still pray to it though.

691
01:40:01,770 --> 01:40:08,390
You've invited the challenge of the mountain. Oh so we were debated just not in the way we

692
01:40:08,390 --> 01:40:14,329
thought. So it doesn't do anything. Apparently it only does stuff before teleporting. It affects

693
01:40:14,329 --> 01:40:20,649
the boss fight. Let's spawn this guy. Holy shit man. My heart is fucking racing. We got it.

694
01:40:22,520 --> 01:40:28,649
Holy shit. I can't believe it. Have you been through here? Uh no. The new difficulty is I

695
01:40:28,649 --> 01:40:35,270
see you. Uh challenge of the mountain makes the boss fight harder with more rewards. I see you.

696
01:40:36,220 --> 01:40:49,449
Hey chat. I see you. And he I got a lot of money. Well rub it in. That took a while for me to

697
01:40:49,449 --> 01:40:57,560
understand what you were saying here. This is a useless tunnel um for my 1400 bucks. Is there

698
01:40:57,560 --> 01:41:09,100
nothing there? Absolutely zero. All right well. It's a very sad tunnel. Some developer worked

699
01:41:09,100 --> 01:41:14,729
really hard on this. Well it's procedurally generated. They probably worked hard on the

700
01:41:14,729 --> 01:41:19,210
tunnel portion but not on where it was gonna end up. I can't believe Notch made this game.

701
01:41:19,210 --> 01:41:35,670
All right I'm pressing the button. You ready? Oh no no no. And after I pick this up. Okay I'm ready.

702
01:41:35,670 --> 01:41:42,170
We haven't seen this. Detonate enemies on kill. Only three people made this game.

703
01:41:42,170 --> 01:41:49,060
Okay let me guess they're all in chat right now. Probably uh what's this is interesting.

704
01:41:50,920 --> 01:41:59,029
Distant Roost. Loop back to the first stage. Loop back Deja Vu. Should we beat it? We beat it again. Nice.

705
01:41:59,029 --> 01:42:07,340
Well that's one that's one way to deal with early access. Am I right? So now we just kind

706
01:42:07,340 --> 01:42:13,659
of cycle through and it gets harder. All right there's um okay um ha ha ha the loud laughter is

707
01:42:13,659 --> 01:42:29,079
coming up in a minute here. Oh I thought that. Oh yes loud very loud laughter. Holy shit these

708
01:42:29,079 --> 01:42:40,710
guys take so many hits. So is there something after ha ha ha? I guess we'll have to survive

709
01:42:40,710 --> 01:42:54,069
long enough to find out. Uh the answer is no apparently. Struggling to kill one beetle.

710
01:42:54,630 --> 01:43:10,939
Bounce it bounce it bounce it bounce it bounce it. Level up. Man these guys are so tanky.

711
01:43:13,859 --> 01:43:19,350
It keeps getting harder but there's no new name for it. Okay. So it's like a progression thing

712
01:43:19,350 --> 01:43:24,390
right? Yeah I think we did the equivalent of like finding of Isaac beating mom or something

713
01:43:25,770 --> 01:43:36,649
for the first time. So the idea is to try to get to this point by like hard or very hard

714
01:43:39,020 --> 01:43:42,939
and just cycle around. Other people are saying in risk of rain one like this

715
01:43:43,659 --> 01:43:49,939
though it's optional you can go to the end game or loop again. So by saying the end game do you mean

716
01:43:49,939 --> 01:43:57,369
like start over or is this endless mode? Oh every teleport increases difficulty by one so you can't

717
01:43:57,369 --> 01:44:10,069
do what I'm describing. Okay that's cool. Secret item glasses. Oh that's the crit. I gotta remember

718
01:44:10,069 --> 01:44:20,789
that. Here it comes. What'd you find? The ha ha ha. Oh we're there. I wonder how many people are

719
01:44:20,789 --> 01:44:27,130
gonna get timed out. By nightbot automatically. At some point after you loop back you can open

720
01:44:27,130 --> 01:44:31,850
another portal for the end. What is this? You are embraced by the healing warmth of the woods.

721
01:44:32,649 --> 01:44:37,779
That's a lot of money for a heal. Well it looks like we already have the heal. I think it's on the

722
01:44:37,779 --> 01:44:54,180
ground. This must just stay. It's nice and centralized. Whoops got overwhelmed. Yeah those

723
01:44:54,180 --> 01:45:02,970
are my friends. I'm just gonna stay in the heal. Never mind that's a bad idea. Move fast out of

724
01:45:02,970 --> 01:45:19,510
combat. That's a joke right? No I need to open a box. Fine I'll activate this one too. Oh we're

725
01:45:19,510 --> 01:45:24,229
we are in ha ha ha zone. We should probably mine the teleporter huh? It's probably. I think

726
01:45:24,229 --> 01:45:28,229
it's right here. And just see what ha ha ha difficulty teleporter looks like. Well it's

727
01:45:28,229 --> 01:45:34,229
right next to me. You want me to press it? Yeah it's right up here. Uh let me open one last box.

728
01:45:34,229 --> 01:45:40,869
Ooh what's that? Cheat death once. I get to die once. What is this? Gunner drone? All right I'll do

729
01:45:40,869 --> 01:45:50,699
the gunner. I'm ready. All right let's do it. It is the beetle queen on ha ha ha difficulty.

730
01:45:51,579 --> 01:45:58,460
So there's two healers down here. It spawns three of them actually. My bad three

731
01:45:58,460 --> 01:46:05,159
beetle queens. So if you start getting low go down into the heal fields below in the valley.

732
01:46:06,300 --> 01:46:21,460
Will do. Oh okay well I'm doing that now. Can we make this better? I don't think so. Yeah that's

733
01:46:21,460 --> 01:46:30,979
pretty good escape to get down there. What do these bugs do? I think that they like have like a weird

734
01:46:30,979 --> 01:46:39,699
AOA field. I thought it was a heal at first but that's definitely not what it is. Oh god. Somehow

735
01:46:39,699 --> 01:46:45,319
I'm just right in the middle of all of them. There's so many of them. Their circles are taking

736
01:46:45,319 --> 01:46:58,229
up so much screen real estate I can't even see through them. What's going on? Suck them all in.

737
01:47:02,199 --> 01:47:09,420
Oh my god there's so many people over there. There really are they like can't move over.

738
01:47:09,420 --> 01:47:23,220
Look at that. This is all damage numbers. That's awesome. Look at them flying around too.

739
01:47:23,939 --> 01:47:32,779
I'm going retreating back to the heal. Who's laughing now game? The game's going to continue

740
01:47:32,779 --> 01:47:38,949
to laugh I think until until it's over. It's going to it's a continuous laugh out loud.

741
01:47:40,140 --> 01:47:45,819
That is very is very funny. Oh god. How am I negating so much damage?

742
01:47:48,619 --> 01:47:52,460
It's like one of these laser. Because I'm standing right next to them like.

743
01:47:52,460 --> 01:47:56,619
Whoa! Oh my god I'm dead. I just got rained on. What just dropped on me?

744
01:47:57,500 --> 01:48:03,819
Why am I alive again? Oh fuck I can cheat death right. Are those bugs dropping those?

745
01:48:03,819 --> 01:48:09,670
I think they might be. Maybe. I just got fucking wrecked. All right two out of three are dead.

746
01:48:10,819 --> 01:48:16,090
Whoops. Whoops. No actually that's a good thing. Holy shit this is gonna be fucking wild.

747
01:48:21,300 --> 01:48:27,939
Where are all these bugs? Dude this is fucking insane. Are those your bugs? No. Oh I'm dead.

748
01:48:28,579 --> 01:48:34,710
No. I wasn't gonna be dead but then I died. I think I went from half health to zero.

749
01:48:36,010 --> 01:48:45,210
Got one shot. Oh my god there's so many things. Please. I did most of the work for the.

750
01:48:45,210 --> 01:48:59,189
Oh no. There's just no way man. No way. We got to see new stuff. That was cool. What is the red pub

751
01:48:59,989 --> 01:49:08,890
zone for? That's the teleporter charge zone. You just stand inside the red to charge the tele.

752
01:49:17,239 --> 01:49:23,079
Kills. We did good. That's right. We've come a long way from dying on the first level. I unlocked

753
01:49:23,079 --> 01:49:31,319
a new character. Like you. The character's fun. I kind of do miss being able to aim and shoot though.

754
01:49:31,319 --> 01:49:40,649
I feel like when I play this character I like the AOE is amazing but sometimes when I'm just

755
01:49:40,649 --> 01:49:45,050
holding the button down it's kind of hard to tell where who I'm even shooting at but still. Yeah

756
01:49:45,050 --> 01:49:53,819
because the bolts just kind of fly off into a random direction. Yeah. It makes sense. It's

757
01:49:53,819 --> 01:50:03,880
the only character with auto aimed. I'll go back to this guy. I'll switch off. Okay. Let me read

758
01:50:03,880 --> 01:50:13,100
my abilities first. Is there a way we can see how to unlock enemies? I mean classes? I can't really

759
01:50:13,100 --> 01:50:29,340
scroll over anything. Go to the log. Log book. I don't have to go back though. I don't want to

760
01:50:29,340 --> 01:50:41,619
leave the menu. Wait am I still in a party with you if I go back to the menu? Looks good. You can

761
01:50:41,619 --> 01:50:46,260
look in the log book to see how to unlock these apparently. Yeah let's just do that. On the main

762
01:50:46,260 --> 01:50:57,399
menu. Let's just do that might as well see. Oh this is cool. All right survivor. Complete 30 stages.

763
01:50:57,399 --> 01:51:02,859
Yep so we're probably not too far. I mean we're probably like halfway. Free the survivor. There's

764
01:51:02,859 --> 01:51:10,409
somebody we can free. Suspended in time. Obliterate yourself at the obelisk and complete the first

765
01:51:10,409 --> 01:51:16,810
teleporter five times. Okay well we'll get this one and this one probably. Yeah the second and

766
01:51:16,810 --> 01:51:22,310
sixth for sure. If you're gonna play Huntress the best part about it is you can shoot while

767
01:51:22,310 --> 01:51:34,789
sprinting so just keep that in mind. And we'll check it out. Items and equipment. Okay this one

768
01:51:34,789 --> 01:51:40,699
and this one while talking to him. Now he knows what I'm talking about. Yeah I know this is the

769
01:51:40,699 --> 01:51:44,699
second and fifth one. The one where you do so many levels and you do the teleporter five times. Yeah.

770
01:51:45,420 --> 01:51:55,539
Right. Yeah oh yeah. On the same page. He's got it. We're on the same page. All right I'm ready. Is

771
01:51:55,539 --> 01:52:01,140
there any customization? I don't think so. I think they're like I don't think there is customization

772
01:52:01,140 --> 01:52:05,539
but I think the thing I remember reading they were most excited about for 3D was every item you pick

773
01:52:05,539 --> 01:52:12,659
up in the game is on the character somehow. That's cool. I didn't even know that was happening until

774
01:52:12,659 --> 01:52:17,220
you just said it. Yeah so now you can look if you pick up the ukulele you get a ukulele if you pick

775
01:52:17,220 --> 01:52:23,460
up the crowbar you get a crowbar. What a fun fucking game huh. All right let's play with our new

776
01:52:23,460 --> 01:52:34,010
friend. All right let's go. The huntress who seems a little squishy. What's your base health? 110.

777
01:52:34,729 --> 01:52:43,859
Yeah so I get 20 less hp. So the theory is let's try to just get this doing this as fast as possible

778
01:52:43,859 --> 01:52:49,180
get a couple get one or two items let's go. Let's try to burn through this. Find the teleporter.

779
01:52:52,260 --> 01:53:01,029
I love making me the boss killer. I got enough like what else do I have a right click.

780
01:53:08,939 --> 01:53:13,500
So many boxes right here. I found the teleporter. You have you ping it? Yeah.

781
01:53:18,920 --> 01:53:29,350
Why are you like right next to it? Yeah right here. I need a box. There's some over by me.

782
01:53:34,390 --> 01:53:41,260
I feel like um like Artemis. Is that why you were getting like the smite vibes? I feel like I'm

783
01:53:41,260 --> 01:53:46,699
playing Artemis and smite. There's little enemies all right cool. All right I say we go for it.

784
01:53:46,699 --> 01:53:50,460
Yeah let's go. I'm doing this. I just did the thing. All right three two one open.

785
01:53:51,260 --> 01:54:08,920
Beat the coin. May as well stand in the bubble here. Oops oh that's okay that's first time I

786
01:54:08,920 --> 01:54:29,350
push that button. Watch out for the poison in the ground. I can't click it fast enough. I need to

787
01:54:29,350 --> 01:54:33,430
be way close. Oh I did it anyway. That worked nice. I'm just trying to help out with the adds

788
01:54:33,430 --> 01:54:38,229
so we don't get overwhelmed too early. I leveled up right next to the boss which is kind of scary

789
01:54:38,229 --> 01:54:45,029
because she does like a aoe really close but I have the uh war banner down.

790
01:54:47,319 --> 01:55:06,699
There's a bunch of people behind us. Be careful. Oops forget that I have a teleport. All right

791
01:55:06,699 --> 01:55:23,939
clean it up. Sick. All right and then for the loot which I don't see. Is there no loot in the ground?

792
01:55:23,939 --> 01:55:34,199
I got a lunar coin. It should be. Where'd that come from? All right okay I see I got there's an onion

793
01:55:34,199 --> 01:55:44,409
and there's a vr headset. I'll just you want the rare one or you want the let's go it's a beetle

794
01:55:44,409 --> 01:55:50,420
guard. All right boxes any boxes left that we didn't get before you keep going. I definitely

795
01:55:50,420 --> 01:56:01,050
have money. Yeah we just move. I think we just gotta go. We're still in easy. Just rifle through.

796
01:56:01,770 --> 01:56:07,130
Oh yeah just activate it. We don't get time. What the teleporter? Yeah we don't get time. I just

797
01:56:07,130 --> 01:56:17,000
found like four boxes. You would have made me miss out on so much loot. Well we gotta go gotta go

798
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:25,960
gotta go gotta go. Okay wait wait well hold on wait hold on wait wait wait. So let me understand

799
01:56:25,960 --> 01:56:35,260
this. When we go in this teleporter it's going to just go to medium automatically. Uh that sounds

800
01:56:35,260 --> 01:56:44,460
right. So we have as much time as we want. No no people saying no. Yes. No yes. No I think so. No

801
01:56:44,460 --> 01:56:52,920
yes. No well let's just go. Okay I'm ready. Look at the bar press it. Yeah well hold on

802
01:56:52,920 --> 01:56:59,239
you're the one down there. Oh well I thought you were sorry. All right so let's see what happens.

803
01:57:00,550 --> 01:57:04,470
We're halfway through easy right now. We're halfway through easy. We're pouring on out.

804
01:57:06,649 --> 01:57:11,689
I think it just goes up yeah it just goes up some. Okay so it goes up like a almost a full one of

805
01:57:11,689 --> 01:57:21,300
those pieces of bubblegum band-aid. It just goes up a tick. It goes up a full band-aid. Have we

806
01:57:21,300 --> 01:57:28,149
done this yet? This looks new. Maybe it's because we actually beat the game on the other thing and

807
01:57:28,149 --> 01:57:36,220
we get a new rotation in like a nice desert map. It goes up by one of those quadrants. Quadrants

808
01:57:36,220 --> 01:57:54,340
means four sorry. It goes up by a basketball period. Exactly oh that's what that does. I have

809
01:57:54,340 --> 01:58:07,079
like um the queen bee but evil. Like your friend but bad but mean. It's you but stronger. Okay I'm

810
01:58:07,079 --> 01:58:20,470
seeing. Oh getting shot. Also known as a third. Yeah it is it is broken up into thirds. Yes I

811
01:58:20,470 --> 01:58:41,670
was gaming. If anything it's uh more damage to healthy enemies. It's a freezer. 151 dollars for

812
01:58:41,670 --> 01:58:54,649
these robots. I need some more boxes. Seems uh pretty sparse out here. Yeah it does. Um I'll take

813
01:58:54,649 --> 01:59:10,659
some help. This is one of those shrines over here. All right I got 145 bucks right there. 125 dollars

814
01:59:10,659 --> 01:59:24,439
come on. It better be good. It is. Wow what is this thing? Is it bad? All right that's kind of weird

815
01:59:24,439 --> 01:59:33,060
because killing an enemy like pulls out my fov. Uh what's your special? It's I get like a frost

816
01:59:33,060 --> 01:59:42,630
aura when I kill something. This actually is pretty awesome. All right good good pick up.

817
01:59:43,189 --> 01:59:48,970
All right we should probably get started here. I've got like one box since we got here.

818
01:59:48,970 --> 01:59:56,199
Oh okay. I found a shrine of combat if you want to come over here. Oh yeah let me just grab this

819
01:59:56,199 --> 02:00:02,039
one box and I will join you shortly. This is not a box. I already picked that up. All right I'm coming.

820
02:00:02,760 --> 02:00:17,270
You can get melee. That's pretty awesome. Extra damage to bosses. Nice. What is this thing?

821
02:00:18,220 --> 02:00:22,779
There's two shrines of combat here I think. Shrine okay there's a shrine of the mountain right there.

822
02:00:22,779 --> 02:00:31,899
Oh boy. Do you sure do we dare do that? Maybe. Should we go for it? Maybe. All right let's turn

823
02:00:31,899 --> 02:00:42,300
it on. I'm gonna activate it. All right the boss is gonna be harder. Invited a challenge to the

824
02:00:42,300 --> 02:00:51,579
mountain. All right come to me. We're still in early game so it's not that big of a deal apparently

825
02:00:51,579 --> 02:00:56,300
so should be good. Whatever they're just trying to take away from our accomplishments future or past.

826
02:00:57,020 --> 02:01:04,569
No they're trying to help. Yeah it's not that big of a deal. Okay I do that all the time on super

827
02:01:04,569 --> 02:01:13,109
hard mode okay. I have a I have 120 hours in this game already. 120? I got a lot of money. I need

828
02:01:13,109 --> 02:01:18,659
something to spend this on. All right come here. Now you know. Turn it on. Activate this. I'm here.

829
02:01:19,380 --> 02:01:37,449
Is that the thing? Is that the challenge cube? I don't know. I guess. Did we just get like a bunch

830
02:01:37,449 --> 02:01:44,859
of money? I think so. I mean there's more stuff here. That's yours. That one's your guy. There's

831
02:01:44,859 --> 02:01:53,939
another challenge cube though. Press it? Over here I guess. All these boxes are open. All right

832
02:01:53,939 --> 02:02:02,380
that spawned. Yeah who did that? Okay that spawned this guy. These guys here. Oh lag. Yeah I got the

833
02:02:02,380 --> 02:02:15,350
lag too. We're just gonna we just get a bunch of money for this. All right we should probably do

834
02:02:15,350 --> 02:02:25,220
the teleporter now. Uh yeah I got we got a lot of money. Where are we gonna spend it all? I don't

835
02:02:25,220 --> 02:02:33,140
know. I don't see any more boxes. Rock music. I'm just gonna have to convert. I don't see anything.

836
02:02:35,319 --> 02:02:46,090
Um do I want to go really fast? Teleport is this way. What he doesn't know? What do you mean?

837
02:02:47,050 --> 02:02:56,100
Wait what? He knows. What do you mean? He doesn't know. Should we tell him chat? Should we? All right

838
02:02:56,100 --> 02:03:05,689
there's a ton of boxes over here by the teleporter. Oh one. I meant sorry. I meant to say one box.

839
02:03:06,250 --> 02:03:11,300
I thought I thought there was more. You ready? Three. Is ready because we're probably ever going

840
02:03:11,300 --> 02:03:24,550
to be. This is one. This is soup. This is a hard boss mode. Oh boy. Yep there's multiple uh robots.

841
02:03:24,550 --> 02:03:37,770
Just try to focus on the big one in the middle here. That's a bunch of robots. Yes there are.

842
02:03:38,649 --> 02:03:47,460
No. What did I end up? What just happened? Oh fuck. Okay. All right. I keep like falling off the

843
02:03:47,460 --> 02:03:57,079
fucking edge. Oh this is bad. This is real bad. What is even hitting me from behind?

844
02:04:01,880 --> 02:04:08,229
Oh that edge. Oh this is bad. Okay. Oh we're dead. We're dead. Game over. Oh you're dead. Oh yeah I got

845
02:04:08,229 --> 02:04:22,760
destroyed. Yeah it's not good. Good luck. Thanks. Shrine of the Mountain sometimes makes an elite

846
02:04:22,760 --> 02:04:29,670
boss too. It adds a boss. Okay so Shrine of the Mountain adds a boss to the level and the boss

847
02:04:29,670 --> 02:04:37,899
can be elite. Oh boy. I forget that teleport only goes forward and I'm used to like dodge rolling

848
02:04:37,899 --> 02:04:54,939
backward. Are there three? No there's only two. Help me. I don't I don't want to go back into that.

849
02:04:54,939 --> 02:05:06,600
There are three. They're standing inside of my fun zone. Wait so we got two by default and then one

850
02:05:06,600 --> 02:05:18,899
extra or one by default and then two extra? All right goodbye. Good night. Yeah we got two extra

851
02:05:18,899 --> 02:05:35,380
bosses by the way if you're curious. I need to get in there. Oh no it's two by default. Oh 11, 14, 15

852
02:05:35,380 --> 02:05:55,510
health. Oh very solid attempt. That was a solid. Very sad. I had the frost aura too. Later on you

853
02:05:55,510 --> 02:06:08,810
can get like nine bosses at once with three shrines. Wow that's ridiculous. Well that was

854
02:06:10,010 --> 02:06:15,060
certainly a challenge. They were just trying to help clear the level for me too yeah. Later on

855
02:06:15,060 --> 02:06:21,140
you can get nine bosses with like three shrines. You can spawn nine of those things. I guess we

856
02:06:21,140 --> 02:06:30,520
need to go. We do. We do. We do. We do. Thank you so great Canadian fuck love 10 community subs.

857
02:06:30,520 --> 02:06:40,279
Thank you. Thank you so much. All right dips. Hey dips. Thank you for those subs.

858
02:06:41,140 --> 02:06:48,680
You're welcome. Hey thanks Tal. Thank you Tal. That was me. That's been you the whole time. Yeah I'm

859
02:06:48,680 --> 02:07:04,579
anonymous. I don't believe that. Dropping subs. I gotta get there. All right play good for a minute.

860
02:07:04,579 --> 02:07:11,050
I need to do something. Play good. Okay I can steal all the boxes. But no thank you for real.

861
02:07:11,050 --> 02:07:18,729
That's a lot. I'm just going to set up a key line so I can mute. So I don't talk over.

862
02:07:19,609 --> 02:07:37,500
Why can I not set this right here? Oh god damn it. Whatever. He's muted too. All right move off.

863
02:07:37,500 --> 02:07:43,829
Okay that's a nod if I haven't seen. Move faster. Just in general not even while sprinting. Just a

864
02:07:43,829 --> 02:07:57,960
generalized move faster huh. Yeah just I have like a cast on. I love double jump. That's probably one

865
02:07:57,960 --> 02:08:03,819
of my favorite ones. What is that? Healing drone? All right I want that. Come on give me like another

866
02:08:03,819 --> 02:08:09,829
two dollars. Three dollars. Yeah the right click is crazy strong on the huntress. Yeah it bounces

867
02:08:09,829 --> 02:08:16,539
around too. It's really good. You can stack 10 of those and have speed hacks. That's insane.

868
02:08:18,140 --> 02:08:22,550
That's the best item in the entire game. If you get like three or four of them.

869
02:08:26,119 --> 02:08:37,800
We got something down here. Lots of boxes. Lots of boxes over here. Three boxes over here.

870
02:08:37,800 --> 02:08:41,960
Oh it's okay. What happens if you fall? Because it makes me feel like I'm going to insta die.

871
02:08:42,119 --> 02:08:46,520
It teleports you back and you lose health. Okay so it's just like a slight health loops.

872
02:08:47,239 --> 02:08:55,819
That's good. Any bear? Around the porter. Did you find it? There's a couple boxes in case we want

873
02:08:55,819 --> 02:09:03,930
to pop it. I'm out of money so there's like I would say I'm ready. You ready? I mean I'm as

874
02:09:03,930 --> 02:09:09,449
ready as I'm gonna be I think. I need more money but there's a health hurt yourself thing here.

875
02:09:09,449 --> 02:09:13,770
There's a health hurt yourself for money thing. There's a hurt yourself for money thing over here.

876
02:09:16,250 --> 02:09:25,579
Um I think that's like a different part of Vegas. All right give me give me give me give me.

877
02:09:25,579 --> 02:09:38,069
It's bollying over here. Where the hell did you guys come from? There's the boss. It is we don't

878
02:09:38,069 --> 02:09:42,869
we don't leave this place yet. There's about four boxes over here we can open but this is all said

879
02:09:42,869 --> 02:10:08,149
and done. Don't leave. Oh don't worry I'm not going anywhere. Good. That hurt. Anyone behind

880
02:10:08,149 --> 02:10:12,520
me? Yeah there is. Always check behind you. I don't know if the arrows can actually hit airborne

881
02:10:12,520 --> 02:10:23,159
enemies like that but I'll try anyways. Oh god it's coming to get me. Is there damage fall off

882
02:10:23,159 --> 02:10:30,100
from far away? There is. Uh good question. Yeah there is. Definitely. What the fuck just what

883
02:10:30,100 --> 02:10:37,939
happened? Um I believe we stayed too close to the jellyfish and uh got exploded. What happened?

884
02:10:37,939 --> 02:10:41,939
Because it does like a charge up ability where you have to get out of the circle.

885
02:10:42,659 --> 02:10:48,579
We I thought I mean I was standing on like a cliff. And we both were inside of its area of influence.

886
02:10:49,220 --> 02:10:57,289
Holy shit. Well that was too bad that would there was a lot of items there too. I'd rather die like

887
02:10:57,289 --> 02:11:00,890
then and it's kind of like dying first floor just get it over with rip the band-aid off

888
02:11:01,750 --> 02:11:08,310
and just do it again better. Stand behind so I didn't even know he it was coming at me. Okay

889
02:11:08,310 --> 02:11:19,020
well that was weird. So just line of sight when he does that. Look away for two seconds dying on

890
02:11:19,020 --> 02:11:28,710
level one. I'm sorry. Just look away for two more seconds and you wouldn't have known that we died.

891
02:11:28,710 --> 02:11:35,989
What if you turn around and look the other way? Based on your sight? What if you just don't look

892
02:11:35,989 --> 02:11:48,539
at him? If he's not on the screen he's not real. That's true. Occlusion. I think that's how game

893
02:11:48,539 --> 02:11:53,850
occlusion works. If you don't look at him he's not loaded in so he's not affecting your frame rate

894
02:11:53,850 --> 02:12:12,149
and thus cannot hit you. What the hell is it? What whoo oh these things. Active ability over here.

895
02:12:18,779 --> 02:12:23,420
Gain 100% there it is. That's the thing you've been getting. Uh oh I almost died. That would

896
02:12:23,420 --> 02:12:34,010
have been very embarrassing. Teleport is over here. Oh oh sorry I hit the DPI button on my

897
02:12:34,010 --> 02:12:44,569
Razor return it death adder. Why do mice even have DPI buttons? It's just a gimmick. Nobody

898
02:12:44,569 --> 02:12:52,329
actually uses them. Uh I gotta teleport you. You want to just give this a go or you want to try to

899
02:12:52,329 --> 02:13:00,149
look for more items? Uh yeah whenever's fine. Let's do it. You have to kind of go through a cave to

900
02:13:00,149 --> 02:13:13,909
get here. I need one penny. One penny? I got it. Uh where's teleport? Uh through the cave over here.

901
02:13:14,710 --> 02:13:26,819
Any more items to get before we go? Uh not that I can see. Did you did you select them all?

902
02:13:27,380 --> 02:13:32,579
I may have selected them all but all of them is like one of them. Yeah there's an active ability

903
02:13:32,579 --> 02:13:44,779
one down there. Let's just go. Where is it? I still got like caught on the teleporter.

904
02:13:45,909 --> 02:13:50,470
Oh it's the jellyfish again but he's in an even more difficult area. Well just like stay in the

905
02:13:50,470 --> 02:13:56,229
cave. Oh no that's a probably bad idea. Yeah it's a bad idea. Uh what if he does that in the cave?

906
02:14:00,380 --> 02:14:04,380
My god yeah that's we're gonna like just get eaten alive. I'm just gonna if I see him charging he's

907
02:14:04,380 --> 02:14:17,430
doing it. What? Okay he's fine. All right we have a giant uh cylinder right we have a giant like

908
02:14:17,430 --> 02:14:23,909
pillar to hide behind. We do but I'm not I I don't trust it to actually block. Why not? I feel like

909
02:14:23,909 --> 02:14:28,649
the damage is just gonna go through. Well that's everyone in chat so that's why you just line aside

910
02:14:28,649 --> 02:14:44,859
it. Here it comes. Well yeah it is it's like infinity distance so it is line of sight. What

911
02:14:44,859 --> 02:14:53,640
is fucking killing me? What is killing me? Was I like burning? That guy was just burning me?

912
02:14:56,569 --> 02:15:03,189
Okay that guy was just burning me. Yeah I think you were just on fire. This is the this is the

913
02:15:03,189 --> 02:15:11,899
worst area for that enemy. That guy was worse than the boss. Okay he's dead. Uh these items are the

914
02:15:11,899 --> 02:15:17,739
same. Dealing damage heals you. That may be the best thing I've seen all day. That's pretty good.

915
02:15:19,479 --> 02:15:24,600
All right ready? Oh we have to charge it still. Uh do we have any items that we can get or do we

916
02:15:24,600 --> 02:15:28,760
just go? I don't think there's any items. I think we just go. I didn't see any leftover boxes unless

917
02:15:28,760 --> 02:15:34,920
there was that. Did you get the active item one? Yeah I did. Okay well then I'll say let's go. I

918
02:15:34,920 --> 02:15:51,239
got the crit one. What is killing me? Gamers I need help. What is killing me? Leech is really

919
02:15:51,239 --> 02:16:05,100
good with commando. Yeah it is. Lots of potential hits. All right let's speed it up. Saving money in

920
02:16:05,100 --> 02:16:13,670
risk of rain. I'm not saving money. I'm trying to just get as much as I possibly can and I'm just

921
02:16:13,670 --> 02:16:19,670
gonna abuse this right because I heal on hits. So why not just abuse it? Oh that's a good idea.

922
02:16:20,310 --> 02:16:29,529
Right well you can only abuse it so much. I'll also take 75 and now you have to do 93 so good luck.

923
02:16:29,529 --> 02:16:39,159
Okay why can I do it? Do I have to have the health? Yeah you have to have it to give it up first.

924
02:16:41,559 --> 02:16:46,540
Okay it's apparently still don't have it. Okay if I get hit once I'm fucking dead.

925
02:16:49,940 --> 02:16:54,180
That's dangerous. I would laugh. I don't like this thing. How much? I got another one. Fucking money.

926
02:16:54,899 --> 02:17:02,549
Yeah I don't like that. That feels weird. I have enough to get a bunch of items though.

927
02:17:04,520 --> 02:17:16,760
More damage to bosses. Yeah I'm like heal boy right now. There we go. Okay I'm fine.

928
02:17:16,760 --> 02:17:27,770
The trade is 100% health next. Why would you even do that? For the lord be so funny.

929
02:17:28,649 --> 02:17:39,350
I mean maybe if you have a thing that brings you back to life. Yeah I guess so. I find there's a

930
02:17:39,350 --> 02:17:45,670
bunch of them over here. If you feel like doing 75% money. I mean they're over here. We have the

931
02:17:45,670 --> 02:17:55,909
leech ability so it's not stupid. Yeah and I have health orbs on kill. You need to spend this money

932
02:17:55,909 --> 02:18:06,950
though first. First and foremost. 75 is not bad. No 93 though is a little scary. More bosses to

933
02:18:06,950 --> 02:18:15,879
damage. It's okay. Good choice on this one. Getting a lot of items though. So many. There's a lot of

934
02:18:15,879 --> 02:18:25,500
boxes on this. Healthy enemies. Is this gasoline? What's this one? There's a ton. Increases attack

935
02:18:25,500 --> 02:18:30,579
speed. I have super shield. Did it decrease? It doesn't feel like I increased very much attack

936
02:18:30,579 --> 02:18:42,680
speed here. Over here. This rinds this way too. This is a. What is this duplicate? I could have

937
02:18:42,680 --> 02:18:53,719
infinity banners if I wanted to. I didn't get anything. I think one banner would be fine. Okay

938
02:18:53,719 --> 02:19:05,770
cool. I found the teleporter. I mean you probably already saw it but there it is. I dropped the

939
02:19:05,770 --> 02:19:12,870
banner right on top of the teleporter conveniently so. I don't got a bad build. Yeah I'm feeling okay.

940
02:19:12,870 --> 02:19:21,639
I don't really do a lot of damage but I have a lot of survivability. 117 bucks. All right maybe

941
02:19:21,639 --> 02:19:27,559
we should ping where you are right now. I pinged the porter. Oh you got it already. Yeah so it

942
02:19:27,559 --> 02:19:31,239
should be highlighted. I've got a bunch of money I don't have anything to spend it on. There's a

943
02:19:31,239 --> 02:19:38,600
few boxes back here but we probably should just get going. We're not even halfway to medium so

944
02:19:38,600 --> 02:19:46,780
it's not the worst. Too many elites over here. Okay what was that? Nice. So you said there's boxes by

945
02:19:46,780 --> 02:19:57,270
you. There is one. There's like two. Oh I see it. I see at least one. There's a chance thing over

946
02:19:57,270 --> 02:20:04,579
there. This is addicting. It is addicting yeah. What's that? You just want to make your character

947
02:20:04,579 --> 02:20:13,959
like super powered. Detonate enemies on hill. And see how strong they can get. Move out of combat fast.

948
02:20:13,959 --> 02:20:20,280
Move fast out of combat. Help me out chat. If you pick up two drop orb of health

949
02:20:21,739 --> 02:20:28,440
and they stack is it a super orb for each enemy or two small orbs from each enemy? Looks like

950
02:20:28,440 --> 02:20:37,299
one super orb. What is this? What is this shrine? Okay it's the chance shrine.

951
02:20:38,280 --> 02:20:42,760
It's four hundred and like seventy dollars. Four hundred seventy dollars. I'm about to spend all my

952
02:20:42,760 --> 02:20:48,920
money on whatever this is. Four hundred seventy dollars dude. A gold orb appears. What does that

953
02:20:48,920 --> 02:20:59,700
mean? I don't know. There's a bunch of beetles over here. Gold orb? Go through the portal. I

954
02:20:59,700 --> 02:21:14,229
don't see a portal. Portal? Gold orb portal? Where? I don't know. Apparently there's a golden

955
02:21:14,229 --> 02:21:18,229
orb somewhere. The portal shows up when you kill the boss. Okay let's go kill the boss. All right

956
02:21:18,229 --> 02:21:26,969
let's go do it. We're already at medium so this is gonna be a challenge. It's all right. If we die

957
02:21:26,969 --> 02:21:34,579
everyone's gonna be pissed. Well that's okay. People are like I've never seen a gold orb before.

958
02:21:34,579 --> 02:21:42,649
Here we go. Activate. Who is it? Stone Titan. I don't think we've seen this yet. Stone Titan.

959
02:21:42,649 --> 02:21:49,370
I think it's the big stony guys. Just a bunch of them. Where the hell are they? Up there? Okay.

960
02:21:49,370 --> 02:22:04,649
I'm dying already. Whoa! Okay hold on a second. What the fuck? Wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow.

961
02:22:08,389 --> 02:22:13,989
Oh I'm I'm I'm dying. I'm dead. Holy shit what the fuck just happened? I didn't even see the

962
02:22:13,989 --> 02:22:23,139
stone titan. He's like I got shredded. I don't even know he's like up top. Fire elites they suck.

963
02:22:23,780 --> 02:22:35,159
Jesus. Yeah I don't think you've seen the people that killed me yet. I almost got out here. Yeah

964
02:22:35,159 --> 02:23:04,569
this is bad. I can't really go anywhere. I need to like wrap around. Okay hold on. Safety. Where are

965
02:23:04,569 --> 02:23:24,899
they? Oh my god will you leave me? I had to do it. I do a lot of damage to bosses. I just don't want

966
02:23:24,899 --> 02:23:40,920
to go in there with like. Okay he's over there. Is he the he's he's launching like volleys or

967
02:23:40,920 --> 02:24:01,139
something? Dude he's okay he's he's I I he's he's there he is. Okay hold on. I I might be all right

968
02:24:01,139 --> 02:24:12,579
here. You might be all right here except enemies are still spawning in and you're almost to heart.

969
02:24:12,579 --> 02:24:22,860
I know. Oh no never mind. I'm probably dead. And then there's that guy. No no no no no no no.

970
02:24:26,440 --> 02:24:33,819
It's cool that I can see your cooldowns. No I can't. I can see you're active but I

971
02:24:33,819 --> 02:24:46,790
can't see your ability cooldowns. Geez. Okay hold on. If I can just farm somebody for health

972
02:24:47,510 --> 02:25:07,059
for a moment. Look at all these fucking people coming over here. This is bad. It's these fire

973
02:25:07,059 --> 02:25:18,979
elites. All right I'm doing okay. We're almost at heart though. I almost have a chance it's not.

974
02:25:18,979 --> 02:25:24,709
I'm gonna stop the spawn. The spawn is what's killing us. He's up there but you know what?

975
02:25:24,709 --> 02:25:33,110
Forget it. I'm really surprised you're still alive. Use that uh war banner. Yeah I'm just trying to

976
02:25:33,110 --> 02:25:54,790
dodge around it. 99% all right. Super shot speed. Done. He's he's doing it. Okay just sniping from

977
02:25:54,790 --> 02:26:05,260
back there. Fuck it. Well easy. Don't be. I'm just getting like cocky there. That was pretty dumb.

978
02:26:05,979 --> 02:26:15,659
I don't like that underwater thing. Like I can't see when I aim up. Yeah I hope that

979
02:26:15,659 --> 02:26:19,500
they like make it so that the camera bounces on the surface of the water or something. Yeah look

980
02:26:19,500 --> 02:26:29,110
at it. I can't even see what the hell I'm doing. It's strategic. You got to think about your

981
02:26:29,110 --> 02:26:39,290
placement. I'll get this. I mean we're gonna be at a very hard. I can't get down to you. He can't

982
02:26:39,290 --> 02:26:49,190
shoot you. No he's. You kind of stand perfectly still and spam. Although I don't know when he's

983
02:26:49,190 --> 02:26:52,950
doing his telegraph move because I'm under the water. So do I get to go through the gold portal

984
02:26:53,590 --> 02:26:56,389
if I'm dead? Or do I have to watch you do the gold portal?

985
02:26:59,670 --> 02:27:08,440
I guess we're gonna find out. You go ahead. Wait no I'm dead. Items. Dealing damage heals you again.

986
02:27:08,440 --> 02:27:19,290
Twice. Wow. Let's do this. Go ahead. This is gonna go through. It's gonna proceed through the tele.

987
02:27:19,290 --> 02:27:26,180
What? I just pressed it. How do you activate this? It said E enter portal. Oh you're going in. It's

988
02:27:26,180 --> 02:27:33,739
probably loading. Oh do you come back? Are you alive? Yeah I'm alive. What? Hidden realm.

989
02:27:33,739 --> 02:27:52,420
Gilded coast. At least I get to see it. All right. Just like that. Here we go. Oh my god. Rebuild the

990
02:27:52,420 --> 02:27:59,000
Halleycon. Seven beacons we have to touch apparently. Oh really? I guess. Look at the top right.

991
02:28:01,059 --> 02:28:08,229
Rebuild the beacons for money. Oh it's money. It's money. Oh I see.

992
02:28:12,180 --> 02:28:19,450
Basically can never stop sprinting as Huntress. That was pretty sick.

993
02:28:28,729 --> 02:28:34,549
Fieldbot finally got up to me. Nice. Are there i-frames on the dodge? Probably not. I don't know

994
02:28:34,549 --> 02:28:45,379
why the hell I asked that. All right I got one. I'm helping. Okay. I got 388 bucks. What do they look

995
02:28:45,379 --> 02:28:53,129
like? Uh they're like little staffs. Like little staves in the ground. I got two out of seven.

996
02:28:53,129 --> 02:28:59,610
On the lunar coin. Do I get to keep that through death? Yes you do. Oh nice. You get to keep it

997
02:28:59,610 --> 02:29:12,420
forever. That hurt. Uh I got another staff over here. Going for it. What is it? 270? 200? 300?

998
02:29:13,059 --> 02:29:31,290
They're the purple in the top left. Oh nice. 278. 278. Okay there's three. They're just

999
02:29:31,290 --> 02:29:45,340
I'm just gonna go along the outskirts and just activate them. Can we fall? I think you just fall

1000
02:29:45,340 --> 02:30:02,440
down there. All right. I got another one. We got four out of seven. Why do we have a boss? A boss

1001
02:30:02,440 --> 02:30:07,540
has just spawned. He's immune to everything. Immune. Immune. Immune. We have to turn off all these things

1002
02:30:08,260 --> 02:30:18,170
I think to be able to kill him. 297. All right I'm gonna activate this one. All right I'm activating

1003
02:30:18,170 --> 02:30:28,170
this one. Five. You got it? We need one. Okay easy. We need uh where is it? It's definitely on the

1004
02:30:28,170 --> 02:30:35,340
outskirts somewhere. Oh he's immune. Oh yeah I see. Yeah we can't. There's boxes down here too.

1005
02:30:36,219 --> 02:30:45,110
Maybe we should not activate this yet. Nice. Move faster. That's what I need right there.

1006
02:30:45,110 --> 02:30:50,809
Okay I'm moving. I'm running. He's too close to me. I don't like this. I'm out of combat right? I

1007
02:30:50,809 --> 02:30:56,680
should be going faster. Where is the uh the last staff? I don't know. Oh here it is. I don't have

1008
02:30:56,680 --> 02:31:03,719
enough money but it's right uh right there. How much money do you have? 139. What is it 270 right?

1009
02:31:04,700 --> 02:31:19,590
Yeah it's like 270. Oh no the rock just fucking no. That's gonna do a lot of damage to me. Hold on

1010
02:31:19,590 --> 02:31:29,049
I'm gonna do it. Come on. I'm gonna do it. Stupid rock. I need one penny. I did it. All right.

1011
02:31:29,049 --> 02:31:48,250
Defeat the boss. We're doing it. Oh god. Oh god. Oh there's like a giant dinosaur chasing behind me.

1012
02:31:48,250 --> 02:31:58,579
That's why I was hurting me. He's like just too far away from my little gold thing to matter.

1013
02:31:58,579 --> 02:32:12,250
That underwater shit is gonna drive me crazy. I'm dead. Oh the like crosshair sink underwater

1014
02:32:12,250 --> 02:32:46,920
thing. That thing just fucked me up bad. I don't even know what killed me. Oh just spawning more.

1015
02:32:55,049 --> 02:33:01,739
You need an insane build to handle this area huh? Well it's it seems kind of manageable. He's a

1016
02:33:01,739 --> 02:33:09,659
munigan? Rebuild the beacons. Oh oh my god. Just kill me. That's a joke. Never mind.

1017
02:33:13,500 --> 02:33:21,989
That's manageable. Apparently you missed a coin. Whatever. You go get the coin chat.

1018
02:33:24,680 --> 02:33:34,219
All right. Hold on. Give me one second. I need to change this. You want to get the coin? 1999 on

1019
02:33:34,219 --> 02:33:48,649
steam. Keybind. I'm this guy. Make it uh. You can be this guy too if you can. Let me test and see if

1020
02:33:48,649 --> 02:33:56,250
that works. I don't know who this guy is though. Okay ready? Hello. All right so just making sure

1021
02:33:56,250 --> 02:34:05,530
I can mute. Um we've done this yet? What's that? I'm surprised we haven't done the uh do the first

1022
02:34:05,530 --> 02:34:10,819
level three times thing or five times. I don't know. I got this guy. So you do have that guy.

1023
02:34:10,819 --> 02:34:18,569
How how can we both don't have it? Um I think I know why. What happened? Because I cheated.

1024
02:34:18,569 --> 02:34:24,780
You cheated? Yeah when I first got the game I have never played Risk of Rain so I did the only the

1025
02:34:24,780 --> 02:34:34,250
first area to see if I wanted to stream it. Oh okay. I am one ahead of you. I see. I got cheated.

1026
02:34:35,260 --> 02:34:42,180
You got cheated. I didn't even read this guy's abilities. Oh shit. That was kind of my fault

1027
02:34:42,180 --> 02:35:03,290
though. All right that was fun. 23 bucks for the chance. What do you got? Uh looks like there's

1028
02:35:03,290 --> 02:35:16,780
some decent boxes down here. Can't have been the freezer. Oh boy. That was all that was in those

1029
02:35:16,780 --> 02:35:27,959
two. This is this guy's crazy. Yeah good. And by crazy I mean I don't know how. What do you mean?

1030
02:35:27,959 --> 02:35:38,579
Manx Shrine of Chance. I love you. Like his movement is. Is it a good character? He's got wheels

1031
02:35:40,649 --> 02:35:44,889
and he dropped bombs and stuff. Move faster out of combat. I need more damage moves.

1032
02:35:47,899 --> 02:35:58,059
That's my alternate fire and then that's throwing the wee bombs. Uh rolling in. So wait can you

1033
02:35:58,059 --> 02:36:06,180
can use two? You're so cool. You look rob. I do look like rob. Apparently you can hold two active

1034
02:36:06,180 --> 02:36:14,469
items. Really? I might just be making that up. Is that true? I'm currently injecting myself with

1035
02:36:14,469 --> 02:36:21,690
attack speed which is the of course thing that this character needs. Spray and pray. You can.

1036
02:36:21,690 --> 02:36:30,709
That's cool. You're like grenades the way you throw my canisters up. Oh that's insane. Uh so I do this

1037
02:36:32,200 --> 02:36:36,440
then I can do this. Same same gun but alternate fire. Watch out behind you.

1038
02:36:37,159 --> 02:36:54,040
Whoops. Wow. As piercing too but you have to go so slow. Oh stunning. What's the weakness?

1039
02:36:54,280 --> 02:37:01,129
I feel like I'm so slow. You look pretty slow. You look like you're having looks like your wheels.

1040
02:37:01,129 --> 02:37:13,079
I also have a giant hitbox. I love how we're just kind of I'm kind of circling mindlessly around.

1041
02:37:13,079 --> 02:37:25,739
Yeah we probably should just like shooting these guys. Big hitbox. Okay shield. Uh it might be time

1042
02:37:25,739 --> 02:37:34,760
to get this going. Yeah it might be time. Where's the uh where's it over there? I'm struggling here.

1043
02:37:34,760 --> 02:37:39,610
Shit I want that. All right I'm gonna come remind me to go get that. He jumped over me.

1044
02:37:41,260 --> 02:37:46,459
There's two bots here. Do we know where the uh thing is yet? Not yet but I definitely want

1045
02:37:46,459 --> 02:37:56,329
to come back and get those. I assume you already went through here. Wrapped this way. I think I can

1046
02:37:56,329 --> 02:38:08,120
get one of them. Damn it. Did I miss it? I probably did. Yeah it's like right in the middle. All right

1047
02:38:08,120 --> 02:38:20,299
you got the stuff. You ready? I am pretty much ready but. All right it's a go. It's a go. I wanted

1048
02:38:20,299 --> 02:38:30,010
to get one of those heal bots. Stone titan. There's quite a few little stone friends over here.

1049
02:38:33,989 --> 02:38:43,459
Ow I could not dodge. I go so slow. Get away from me buddy. You can call me Wally not buddy.

1050
02:38:44,020 --> 02:38:54,229
Wally where are you stone titan? Back here. He's behind the pillar. He's just hiding. Yeah hiding.

1051
02:38:54,229 --> 02:39:01,059
He's line of sighting us. Oh that's fine. Keep doing that. I think I remember reading that they're

1052
02:39:01,059 --> 02:39:06,420
gonna make the teleporter easier to see because even though chat probably can see it without any

1053
02:39:06,420 --> 02:39:11,700
problem whatsoever uh they're gonna make it at least easier for streamers to see. I think that's

1054
02:39:11,700 --> 02:39:18,420
one of the first patch notes. For streamers? Yeah we've had some complaints that streamers can't see

1055
02:39:18,420 --> 02:39:30,309
it. Streamers are having trouble seeing it. I'm stuck on top of these guys. This is the uh streamer

1056
02:39:30,309 --> 02:39:43,110
update. I really do think they're changing that though. That's fine. Because like risk of rain one

1057
02:39:43,110 --> 02:39:49,260
you know you just go left or right. It's either left or right. Up or down. Where's the z-axis?

1058
02:39:49,260 --> 02:40:09,129
Doesn't exist. I have money to get my heal bot. Where the hell is my healing drone? There he is.

1059
02:40:16,969 --> 02:40:26,100
Almost dead. I don't know when to use oh my god. Good. When do you snipe mode or when not to?

1060
02:40:26,100 --> 02:40:30,659
We both. Ukuleles. We both can get it. I want to get another one of these. So what does that do?

1061
02:40:30,659 --> 02:40:39,780
Does it electrify shots or something? I believe that the ukulele does a spreading zap move.

1062
02:40:42,229 --> 02:40:53,780
Oran fruit. Heal. So it's just a heal. Cool. Probably pretty helpful. It's yeah it's a chain

1063
02:40:53,780 --> 02:41:08,200
lightning. I want that of the drone and then we can get out of here. There's a box down there too.

1064
02:41:08,760 --> 02:41:31,819
I'll get that on the way back. Let's see. Wasn't it over here? I'm just walked up the edge. Yeah

1065
02:41:31,819 --> 02:41:38,659
it's right here. Yeah I just uh I just turned him down. He was low and now he's he was high and

1066
02:41:38,659 --> 02:41:42,819
then he's I think he should be in a couple final boxes and things up here to spend money on. Sounds

1067
02:41:42,819 --> 02:41:52,180
better. We're gonna struggle with the next level though. There's one more box here. I need more of

1068
02:41:52,180 --> 02:42:00,040
these goat hooves. Cool cool. I got two drones. All right whenever you're ready. I'll be ready

1069
02:42:00,040 --> 02:42:09,399
in three two one. Can I will I die if I take infinite fall damage? Yeah I'm ready. Surprisingly

1070
02:42:09,399 --> 02:42:28,459
no. Send us to the next zone. We're on our way. Do I die if I take infinite damage? That's an

1071
02:42:28,459 --> 02:42:33,909
interesting question. Yeah we're getting some good stuff. What's the question? Uh no you said do I

1072
02:42:33,909 --> 02:42:38,790
die if I take fall infinite fall damage? Oh well because the robot doesn't have a teleport or

1073
02:42:38,790 --> 02:42:45,750
dodge roll. He just goes oh he just goes fast oh and then rams into things. So I was curious

1074
02:42:45,750 --> 02:42:53,049
since I don't have like a stop. We're going to make this a quick one because we're in medium

1075
02:42:53,049 --> 02:43:05,000
already. Yeah. Your moveset looks kind of cool though. It seems fun. It just it seems like

1076
02:43:05,959 --> 02:43:10,250
they overload you with HP because you're going to take tons of damage.

1077
02:43:17,850 --> 02:43:33,340
Ah my character has 560 HP right now. Let me go this way. 72. Another crowbar.

1078
02:43:36,469 --> 02:43:43,049
Oh a different teddy bear. Chance to block incoming damage. How much more do I have?

1079
02:43:45,379 --> 02:43:56,059
That jump is really generous. It jumps across the whole game. Come over there.

1080
02:43:56,620 --> 02:44:01,670
All right we've got to consider turning the portal on here. So if your healing drone dies

1081
02:44:01,670 --> 02:44:09,979
does it like recharge or does it like what happens? Probably not. I need 72 dollars.

1082
02:44:12,709 --> 02:44:24,950
That's really really good range. Will we get a raid coming? Who raided? No money. Where are the

1083
02:44:24,950 --> 02:44:31,290
enemies on this one? Drones just die when they're killed. Good to know. Got another coin. I got two

1084
02:44:31,290 --> 02:44:40,729
coins. Tomato? Tomato raid. What's going on tomato? Hope you had a good stream. I don't know what you

1085
02:44:40,729 --> 02:44:44,170
were doing but it was fucking awesome. So is it better to get the chests that are on the ground

1086
02:44:44,170 --> 02:44:50,229
that are the same price or the ones that have like the three tubes? You know what I mean?

1087
02:44:50,229 --> 02:44:58,760
Oh that's a good question. We both seem to give I think similar gear. The three tubes you choose

1088
02:44:58,760 --> 02:45:02,680
what you want. Oh I had just been walking up to them. Like it may as well be because right we

1089
02:45:02,680 --> 02:45:07,959
don't know what anything does anyway. Taleks and I are playing risk of rain 2. Depending on which side

1090
02:45:07,959 --> 02:45:12,409
you're on. Yeah we don't know what anything does anyways guys. We've not died once. We've never

1091
02:45:12,409 --> 02:45:25,340
played risk of rain 1. We haven't died one time yet so welcome. Now you ready to activate this thing?

1092
02:45:25,979 --> 02:45:30,780
Yeah I just can you ping me? Uh oh I thought you're just over there. Yeah I'm like at the

1093
02:45:30,780 --> 02:45:43,290
furthest end of the map possible. I didn't find it yet so. Oh well that does change things. Sorry

1094
02:45:43,290 --> 02:45:56,180
I was uh I got raided. Got raided by tomato. Sponsored by fruit. He came in swinging with all

1095
02:45:56,180 --> 02:46:04,870
of his fucking friends. Uh okay I should just give me something. Come on nothing twice in a row?

1096
02:46:05,590 --> 02:46:15,100
Three times in a row. Third time's the charm. There it is again. All right why are you linking

1097
02:46:15,100 --> 02:46:31,559
that clip? Of Cheeto? Why? What is that stupid item that sucks? So we don't know where the

1098
02:46:31,559 --> 02:46:37,850
teleporter is. Oh that's very interesting. They're really gonna make a streamer mode

1099
02:46:38,489 --> 02:46:47,350
so we can see it better. That's what I'm saying. Yeah I'm ready. I am for fully embrace the stream

1100
02:46:47,430 --> 02:46:54,819
mode. Yeah I got like a little uh helicopter buddy. I got a I got a lego set thing. All right well

1101
02:46:54,819 --> 02:46:59,850
whenever we find it. All right look at all right down I got I got I got it down here. Follow me

1102
02:47:00,729 --> 02:47:15,030
over there like behind that guy. Behind that guy. Yeah behind Tommy Pickles guy. It's here somewhere.

1103
02:47:15,030 --> 02:47:23,190
Oh yeah there is the orange right here on this strange platform. All right you ready? We're on

1104
02:47:23,510 --> 02:47:28,860
almost hard mode already. Almost yeah. Wait what are we looking for? Stone titan again.

1105
02:47:35,399 --> 02:47:48,569
Stone titan again. Anything a lot inside any small rocks? I'm just gonna stay here and do damage I

1106
02:47:48,569 --> 02:47:59,100
guess. Is this a big enough rock? I don't think so. What kind of a person cries about farts? You know

1107
02:47:59,100 --> 02:48:06,139
you have to be there. I can't I cannot defend that clip unless you were sitting here watching that

1108
02:48:06,139 --> 02:48:14,090
stream two days ago. Uh something I should know. It is no way I can explain it. Doesn't matter.

1109
02:48:14,889 --> 02:48:24,440
It's impossible. All right what do you drop? Uh I picked up a thing that I didn't know what it did.

1110
02:48:25,079 --> 02:48:30,200
I now have a titanic neural. Why not do it? This is this is actually going pretty well.

1111
02:48:30,920 --> 02:48:35,659
It's just a strangely fun word. It's an inside joke. It's not even an inside joke. I just

1112
02:48:35,659 --> 02:48:40,040
couldn't explain it. It would take about 30 to 40 minutes for me to explain what happened.

1113
02:48:46,840 --> 02:48:52,920
Try. I can't. You try. Call somebody into your room right now that's like at your house

1114
02:48:52,920 --> 02:49:01,930
and explain that to them. Okay. Hey. Derma. Come over here real quick. I gotta show you something.

1115
02:49:01,930 --> 02:49:08,059
Well I can't be on your webcam because I don't have any clothes on. Everybody thinks that's

1116
02:49:08,059 --> 02:49:15,879
bullshit. I don't have I don't have any I have no upper body clothes on. All right ready well

1117
02:49:15,879 --> 02:49:29,219
actually I got money. Bullshit. You got a hundred you got a hundred eighty four dollars.

1118
02:49:30,469 --> 02:49:36,100
Uh yep. Come over here. I'm gonna activate that. Like no activate like this thing.

1119
02:49:36,739 --> 02:49:39,540
Oh trying. Well I don't have a hundred and eighty four virtual dollars.

1120
02:49:40,100 --> 02:49:45,860
Oh you don't? I have a hundred and five. That's not enough. All right we got it. Let's go. We're

1121
02:49:45,860 --> 02:49:51,559
kind of just uh anymore boxes like right here. No hold on. Not yet. No yeah. I think I'll have

1122
02:49:51,559 --> 02:50:07,530
a hundred and eighty four in a second. All right. There it is. All right. What is that? What is

1123
02:50:07,530 --> 02:50:13,290
that little fireball? I spent a hundred and eighty four dollars to see it. Somebody said you're so

1124
02:50:13,290 --> 02:50:27,110
greedy. I'm a simple man. I cheat. Box I click it. Wait can I trade um what is this? I'm a simple

1125
02:50:27,110 --> 02:50:37,739
man. I'm a shwee. Oh it's actually not bad. All right. We gotta get out here. We have to get out

1126
02:50:37,739 --> 02:50:49,639
here. We really do. I'm teleporting away. Take us away. But he said it. He said the thing.

1127
02:50:50,360 --> 02:51:01,239
All right. What did he say? I said the s word. Right. It's it's a horrible square.

1128
02:51:04,200 --> 02:51:09,000
It breaks like Jeremy terms. It breaks German on eight five terms of service when you say it.

1129
02:51:14,469 --> 02:51:35,690
Um not sheet help. Let's find this thing quick so we can be ready for it. Do you see it? I have so

1130
02:51:35,690 --> 02:51:47,180
much health. It's insane. Anybody see it? Help the streamers out. We need streamer mode engaged.

1131
02:51:47,180 --> 02:52:06,819
I'm moving around 278 dollars. Oh here it is. It's there but we haven't got a single box. Is

1132
02:52:06,819 --> 02:52:12,329
that okay? But just be be ready for us if we can just get over there quick. It's taking me a long

1133
02:52:12,329 --> 02:52:19,209
time to kill anything. Yeah that's kind of what I'm also experiencing. How many bits for more

1134
02:52:19,209 --> 02:52:28,389
sheeto? I don't do that. Explain this thing that you keep saying. I I doesn't dude is no way.

1135
02:52:29,270 --> 02:52:34,229
You and I could sit downstairs and like like drink a bottle of whiskey over the course of like would

1136
02:52:34,229 --> 02:52:38,549
it require a bottle of whiskey? No but I'm saying like it would be like a let's have like a six hour

1137
02:52:38,549 --> 02:52:43,590
conversation and like hang out and like swirl around our fucking whiskies over ice. It'd take

1138
02:52:43,590 --> 02:53:04,180
that long. It's a long time. I know. Yeah I would have to give I would have to give you a swirly

1139
02:53:04,180 --> 02:53:30,280
before for you to understand. What a swirly. Yeah um that bolt that was kind of sad. What

1140
02:53:30,280 --> 02:53:36,709
just happened there? Okay getting blocked. All right are we activating this or no?

1141
02:53:37,430 --> 02:53:46,379
Um what is this? Get milky crystal? Sounds like a serial advertisement. Gain temporary flight.

1142
02:53:48,059 --> 02:53:57,299
Oh I dropped that. I feel like this just makes you more vulnerable to any attacks. You just have to

1143
02:53:57,540 --> 02:54:01,940
press. I'm activating. It's very hard. All right we're activating this. Wait wait wait wait wait

1144
02:54:01,940 --> 02:54:07,940
wait wait. Oh shit. I'm I'm at with my heel. Why did I even pick up a stupid fucking mosquito

1145
02:54:07,940 --> 02:54:36,659
wing? Seriously. Ow. Look at this. All right we gotta focus on one. Left or right? Extra damage

1146
02:54:36,659 --> 02:54:42,040
to bosses is in that 3d printer by the way. Yeah. Like right next to us. Oh I gotta move.

1147
02:54:42,680 --> 02:54:49,610
This is gonna be right in my face. These elites are ridiculous.

1148
02:54:50,409 --> 02:55:13,379
Where'd my missile launcher go? Somebody's shooting us from behind. No that's you. I think

1149
02:55:13,379 --> 02:55:20,549
you just shot me in the back like five times. Apologize now. That's for the swirly. I didn't

1150
02:55:20,549 --> 02:55:25,350
even give it to you yet. Dude I don't think I could even lift you up off the ground like upside down.

1151
02:55:25,350 --> 02:55:39,719
Oh my god. Is that a fat joke? Okay I'm getting sucked into the vortex. Is that a fat or a weak joke?

1152
02:55:39,719 --> 02:55:45,290
I'm dying. I'm taking that either way. Guys I don't know why I couldn't move.

1153
02:55:46,010 --> 02:55:55,930
Why did I fucking do anything? Why did I just get double sucked? Double sucked? I couldn't.

1154
02:55:55,930 --> 02:56:03,049
I there's nothing I could do. Dodge roll didn't do anything. I was just in it.

1155
02:56:08,600 --> 02:56:19,590
How do I use my tactical missiles again? I think I threw them away on accident. Good. Switch to real

1156
02:56:19,590 --> 02:56:26,500
gun. No that would require me to let go of the left mouse button. Yeah I got pulled I got too

1157
02:56:26,500 --> 02:56:40,489
tethered. No button did anything. It was just time for you to die. Grab your wings. Anything else

1158
02:56:40,489 --> 02:56:45,450
with my $1,300 I should get before going? You have to switch your weapon apparently.

1159
02:56:46,780 --> 02:56:56,059
Game's done on switch. Everyone likes the robot. Which shoots faster chat? That one

1160
02:56:56,700 --> 02:57:04,709
or this one? You know we're up against time with it right? I'm just curious. Do you want to

1161
02:57:04,709 --> 02:57:14,760
wear that? Is there like a taunty mode I can do? Like hold on. Shake my robot ass like that at the

1162
02:57:14,760 --> 02:57:20,200
camera while you spectate helplessly. Here we go. Mad because bad. Mad because bad. Mad because bad.

1163
02:57:25,590 --> 02:57:31,239
Passive aggressive streamer. You know what I like doing? I just want to make sure you're aware

1164
02:57:31,239 --> 02:57:37,659
there's a time limit. Do you know that? Oh we're on insane already. Yep this is gonna be it.

1165
02:57:40,870 --> 02:57:43,510
I didn't want I was gonna hold this back from you but I decided to tell you.

1166
02:57:45,989 --> 02:57:51,879
I picked up a second coin. I also have two coins. Well yeah how come you didn't tell me about the

1167
02:57:51,879 --> 02:57:58,379
second one? I did. I told you both times. Check the Vaughn. I'm gonna watch the whole Vaughn to

1168
02:57:58,379 --> 02:58:10,809
make sure. Insane and then after that is important. Imposter more like. Insane important and then

1169
02:58:11,530 --> 02:58:21,290
whatever comes out. All right I'm not touching like the dragon claw. I'm not convinced this does any

1170
02:58:21,290 --> 02:58:35,829
damage. Shrine of combat. No I ain't doing that. This is like a boss. Dodge rolling. This guy's

1171
02:58:35,829 --> 02:58:55,780
juking me around. He's acting like a flayer. Oh man this is gonna be rough. This is bad.

1172
02:58:58,100 --> 02:59:04,540
Touch it. Touch it. I'm not gonna. Guys look at how much we're struggling already here.

1173
02:59:17,290 --> 02:59:35,399
There's a giant dinosaur. There's like a monster rancher enemy over here. I'm gonna die. Jesus

1174
02:59:35,399 --> 02:59:56,409
leave me alone. I'm dead. I don't like this character. This character seems incredibly

1175
02:59:56,409 --> 03:00:12,680
vulnerable. Are you dead? Yeah oh yeah I died. Oh sorry. I took like 75 percent of my health in

1176
03:00:12,680 --> 03:00:18,299
the two tenths of a second. Oh well then let me just. What'd you do? What'd you do that for?

1177
03:00:19,020 --> 03:00:22,860
Because I didn't even get. I wasn't even close. I don't even know where the thing was. What about

1178
03:00:22,860 --> 03:00:37,829
our statistics? Game knows. Autosave. Well I unlocked the robot too. See autosave. Let me see.

1179
03:00:39,340 --> 03:00:50,149
That's too much. Too many words. I don't want to do it. Too many words to retool and rapidly

1180
03:00:50,149 --> 03:01:00,760
fire nails. Are we gonna do double robot? Um it'd be different. I mean we could do it. I haven't

1181
03:01:00,760 --> 03:01:09,049
been commando guy in a while. It's a stun canister. Basically you're uh gonna get yelled at for using

1182
03:01:09,049 --> 03:01:15,639
the wrong weapon so just get ready. That's all right. No matter what. That's fine. By me. I'm gonna

1183
03:01:15,639 --> 03:01:22,840
be the one yelling. Don't. You don't yell at me. I'm gonna. Switch to sniper. Am I okay? Am I crazy

1184
03:01:22,920 --> 03:01:29,340
or is the taskbar button for this game Planetside 2? Taskbar? Like on your taskbar.

1185
03:01:33,579 --> 03:01:38,620
Yeah it kind of is. It's the big number two with a font that I'm pretty sure that I downloaded from

1186
03:01:38,620 --> 03:01:46,149
dafont.com a long time ago. You didn't. All right let's see. Blast canister is a launch of stun

1187
03:01:46,149 --> 03:01:53,579
canister for 220 uh and then a weird symbol I don't recognize. It's like a bicycle. It's like

1188
03:01:53,579 --> 03:01:59,020
it's a top. It's a butterfly. Do you want me to unlock so you can read? 220 butterfly. Too late.

1189
03:01:59,979 --> 03:02:05,959
I don't know what that means but. We're going it. Yeah let's go. I'll figure it out.

1190
03:02:09,540 --> 03:02:23,819
I'm looking over here. Really? What? Nobody. Nobody liked that one. They all didn't like that.

1191
03:02:24,540 --> 03:02:32,700
Which one? I said something stupid. So this is now you can charge that. Okay.

1192
03:02:34,040 --> 03:02:37,399
You can actually just tap left click I found out. It feels like you have to hold it down though.

1193
03:02:38,200 --> 03:02:46,069
This is like the sprint around mode. So that's sprint around mode. This is the switch mode.

1194
03:02:47,620 --> 03:02:58,760
Double switch. Now where the hell's an enemy? This game's supposed to be hard. Where are the

1195
03:02:58,760 --> 03:03:18,600
enemies? Speed run. Where are the enemies though? Well I'm awful with this character.

1196
03:03:19,770 --> 03:03:23,049
Uh it's kind of difficult but you get a lot of health. Look at your health pool. Oh I do.

1197
03:03:23,049 --> 03:03:32,540
You're right. Uh spam right click basically and. Right click. Can I hold it? Okay I can.

1198
03:03:35,780 --> 03:03:45,780
It's like a stun bomb. Hey uh does anyone see the teleporter? That is pretty generous. I hope they

1199
03:03:45,780 --> 03:03:54,649
make them like a little bit easier to find in the future patch. Okay I got double shield.

1200
03:03:55,450 --> 03:04:06,219
Actually kind of fun to use this. It's one hit kill for a lot of enemies. Yeah it's like really

1201
03:04:06,219 --> 03:04:15,829
good at just chomping on chumps. And this is the how long does this last for? Do I cancel if I

1202
03:04:15,829 --> 03:04:25,659
jump? I do. Not even a fucking good game. Oops. Whoa. Um. I was waiting for you to come around.

1203
03:04:25,659 --> 03:04:33,260
We should probably. Activate. Activate. Yeah. It's just like a shitty run. This is like a wash run.

1204
03:04:33,260 --> 03:04:41,940
Not gonna you know what I mean? Yeah it's a reset. So what's better to use like this or this here?

1205
03:04:41,940 --> 03:04:59,399
Probably this. Uh this I think. Between the two. Like when the stupid stone guys get stuck

1206
03:04:59,399 --> 03:05:06,229
and they just sit there and jump in place on the trampoline. Now does holding it do anything else?

1207
03:05:06,229 --> 03:05:34,059
Or is it just kill? Oh hi. It's the boss. Oh dear. This is not a place I want to be.

1208
03:05:34,860 --> 03:05:38,700
Does it go through everybody? I think it does. Oh that's actually really good.

1209
03:05:49,940 --> 03:06:25,780
Oh another coin. All right the boss is dead. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. We got to the. All right cool.

1210
03:06:25,780 --> 03:06:30,579
Red whip. All right we each get to move fast out of combat. That's a boss drop. I'm disappointed.

1211
03:06:31,139 --> 03:06:39,129
That's still all right. Boomer reference. You know you guys say that but.

1212
03:06:40,100 --> 03:06:52,040
You want to try the money machine? You laughed at it. Money machine. Oh yeah. Fruit. I'll save you a

1213
03:06:52,040 --> 03:07:04,809
box. Is there a box here? There's a box. Box. Right there. Why did that look like I was going slower?

1214
03:07:05,450 --> 03:07:09,510
I also busted the other money machine. Just for you.

1215
03:07:13,829 --> 03:07:21,190
The mask of inferno. I like prepped that for you. Yeah you like you sat at like the slot machine.

1216
03:07:21,190 --> 03:07:25,670
I sat at that machine. And spent like five grand and lost everything and I came over and put a

1217
03:07:25,670 --> 03:07:39,719
dollar in. Thanks. Hey. Let's go. Hey. You have money? I have 14 dollars. No I don't. Granny sniped

1218
03:07:40,280 --> 03:08:00,090
your slot. Yeah. Cool. You guys should be nice to your elders. Right off the bat. We've got a hurt

1219
03:08:00,090 --> 03:08:07,270
me machine. I'll take it. You can do it too. Oh thank you. What about over here? How much

1220
03:08:07,270 --> 03:08:13,829
gold did you get? I got 110. Which one of these do I want? Why did you get more money for losing

1221
03:08:13,829 --> 03:08:17,909
less health? Rapidly heal outside of danger. That's actually kind of good.

1222
03:08:18,870 --> 03:08:28,020
Oops. Oh he turns into a ghost. Right. Two luck. It feels like two luck sometimes.

1223
03:08:28,659 --> 03:08:38,229
Fuck it. No I'm not doing it again. Let's go nine luck. Ah yeah. Too bad it's a med kit.

1224
03:08:38,950 --> 03:08:48,010
So there's an initial burst on that isn't there? That's cool. That's why you should

1225
03:08:48,010 --> 03:09:00,700
switch between them. On the right click? Yeah for the robot. Okay. Oops. I keep thinking that's

1226
03:09:00,700 --> 03:09:15,100
right click for some reason. Got some money? Wait people are saying they can't see squad mode

1227
03:09:15,100 --> 03:09:19,420
because it's not working. Has it not been on the whole time and nobody said anything? It says it's

1228
03:09:19,420 --> 03:09:27,659
on. Yeah it says it's on. It says my squad. It says my squad. Maybe twitch just fucking it's a

1229
03:09:27,659 --> 03:09:34,069
new feature and they're just like fuck we don't know what to do about this. Here I'm gonna leave

1230
03:09:35,530 --> 03:09:43,450
and then. Squad mate. Whoops I just invited someone else. Hold on. Dude come on bring him in.

1231
03:09:44,170 --> 03:09:53,540
Invite him to the squad. Okay there we go. I just sent you the invite. All right well hold on.

1232
03:09:56,979 --> 03:10:02,649
We can refresh. You're gonna have to protect me over here because I need the light. Um not even

1233
03:10:02,649 --> 03:10:15,739
close. Uh let me see. My squad. Uh I don't see anything. Let's see. Except we're in a squad.

1234
03:10:16,540 --> 03:10:30,700
We're in the squad. Apparently we're in a squad. Timing on that. All right does it work now?

1235
03:10:32,040 --> 03:10:38,170
Uh I don't think so. I don't know what people are saying. I don't see. What are people saying?

1236
03:10:38,969 --> 03:10:46,229
Nothing. Nothing. It's pretty simple on our side because there's literally you type in the name.

1237
03:10:46,229 --> 03:10:52,180
Send an invitation. They accept and that's supposed to be it. Well it doesn't seem to be doing its

1238
03:10:52,180 --> 03:11:04,540
intended function. All right what is the uh any sign of the thing? The squad button is kind of

1239
03:11:04,540 --> 03:11:11,450
hard to see to be honest when it does work. It's like above the stream and to the right.

1240
03:11:11,450 --> 03:11:17,049
No we don't even need to be in a squad. We're like we're our squad in game. Everyone knows us as the

1241
03:11:17,049 --> 03:11:32,309
squad. You are taking way too many of these nails. I need a box please. Yeah I need like uh

1242
03:11:32,309 --> 03:11:45,299
something to spend on. Nothing. Come on. Come on. Really? I can hear you losing out across the map.

1243
03:11:45,299 --> 03:12:08,790
Yeah I did. I'll be able to do it one more time here. Then we got to activate this. One fifteen

1244
03:12:08,790 --> 03:12:20,520
was it? Do you know where the uh teleporters? That's over here I think. Oh shit I can't do

1245
03:12:20,520 --> 03:12:30,920
it anymore. Oh did you take this one? Oh you did. I did. I sniped it. What about is there

1246
03:12:30,920 --> 03:12:33,959
another box or something? All right we gotta find the thing. We're gonna find teleporter.

1247
03:12:34,520 --> 03:13:11,420
I'm just gonna go speed mode. Well um see it over here. Go that way. Yeah okay. I'm just gonna head

1248
03:13:11,420 --> 03:13:19,989
there. I think we're ready. You good? Ready to give this try? Yeah I'm just popping this last uh

1249
03:13:19,989 --> 03:13:40,069
money machine. I'm ready. I'm ready. Wait how do I cycle my active? Oh I get it. Okay that makes

1250
03:13:40,069 --> 03:14:07,000
sense. That's not just cycling my cannon. That's cycling everything. Excuse me. I missed my super

1251
03:14:07,000 --> 03:14:18,180
boss damage. Ow. I'm getting killed by these like bells. I have a lot of health. This thing. I was

1252
03:14:18,180 --> 03:14:27,190
scared. I was gonna just tank most. I'm the one gonna die. I'm coming to you. There are a lot of

1253
03:14:27,190 --> 03:14:43,559
these. Oh there's a lot of bells. Oh my god. I'm gonna take the bells out from afar. Boss is almost

1254
03:14:43,559 --> 03:15:10,889
dead. Oh jeez. Oh boy. Oh jeez. There's so many bells. Boss is dead. Boss is down. Nice. This is

1255
03:15:10,889 --> 03:15:19,799
really a million of these things. We've never seen anything like this before. Uh oh. Because we're

1256
03:15:19,799 --> 03:15:26,280
almost on hard on the second level. We took too long I guess. We took too long. Teleport is ready

1257
03:15:26,280 --> 03:15:33,959
though. It's the name of the game. We took too long. Yeah that is the title. I don't think

1258
03:15:33,959 --> 03:15:37,659
there's anything else to spend money on. Is there nothing else to spend money on? I don't know. I

1259
03:15:37,659 --> 03:15:44,329
don't see anything. Maybe we gotta we gotta yeah we gotta just get out of here. Might as well take

1260
03:15:44,329 --> 03:15:51,420
us out. No you take us out. Uh you take us out. No you take us out. And you take you you had play

1261
03:15:51,420 --> 03:16:00,069
us on out of here. All right I'll get I'll get I got I got I got I got I got it. We both did it.

1262
03:16:00,069 --> 03:16:17,610
We both pressed it together. Good job. Okay cool. Uh do you want should I get a drumstick or what?

1263
03:16:19,030 --> 03:16:33,159
No. You know I pushed the squad button. See if it works. Come on. There was a hidden button.

1264
03:16:33,719 --> 03:16:38,120
What are you talking about with the squad? You have to like actually it's not enough that we're both

1265
03:16:38,120 --> 03:16:45,020
live and that we do the invitation but we also there's you have to like initiate it. What? It's

1266
03:16:45,020 --> 03:16:57,510
active. So chatters unite. Only took three hours but you know what better late than never.

1267
03:16:58,229 --> 03:17:08,979
Name of the game. What's the name of the game Shad? Took too long. All right here we go.

1268
03:17:08,979 --> 03:17:25,639
Uh we got we have to activate this **** like now. We're in hard. I hate these time boxes that really

1269
03:17:25,639 --> 03:17:40,010
are like you're too slow. Sorry you can't open this. There's a mega skull back there. There's so

1270
03:17:40,010 --> 03:17:51,459
many shrines and no boxes. All right I got money. I'm going this way. Rapidly heal outside. I feel

1271
03:17:51,459 --> 03:17:56,020
like I just want to go. I need some of these. If you see an equipment box could you let me know

1272
03:17:56,020 --> 03:18:01,299
because I have a thing that lets me double charge any equipment but I haven't found any.

1273
03:18:02,020 --> 03:18:15,190
I'm just gonna find the teleporter. Hey there's one. It's too bad it's temporary flight again.

1274
03:18:17,780 --> 03:18:29,290
I'm gonna say it's over here. What is going on? This is one guy from that far away really just

1275
03:18:29,290 --> 03:18:41,989
do all that ****. All right it's right here. It looks like you see the smoke. The smoke?

1276
03:18:46,120 --> 03:18:54,200
It's the boss one right? Yeah I see it. It's up there. It's right there.

1277
03:18:54,840 --> 03:19:07,959
There's a little. Oh this thing costs one lunar. Is that worth it? Is it worth it for a coin for a

1278
03:19:07,959 --> 03:19:13,879
coin of the order? I don't know considering we've been here for a while. This this run might stop

1279
03:19:13,879 --> 03:19:24,500
at the next stop. No that is a meme. Okay that's kind of mean. It's a save. Don't do it. Okay do

1280
03:19:24,500 --> 03:19:29,079
we know where the oh it's over here. Yeah it's right. You're right. It's on me. We're gonna lose.

1281
03:19:29,079 --> 03:19:33,799
I mean I don't have any offensive capability whatsoever. Oh my god these guys are unbearable.

1282
03:19:34,680 --> 03:19:41,379
Let me help. It's this thing. Okay we did we got this exact same thing at the same level

1283
03:19:41,379 --> 03:19:46,739
already. We had to do this **** already on the cliff here too. Oh boy. Oh god.

1284
03:19:47,940 --> 03:19:54,819
This is where we died last time. Yeah I'm getting the hell out of here. Try and stay inside the red.

1285
03:19:54,819 --> 03:20:09,059
I'm gonna try. No guarantees. Stupid temporary flying nonsense. Oh my god no way.

1286
03:20:12,500 --> 03:20:23,930
This is nuts. Goodbye. Yep I'm dying. I'm dead. They can shoot through the bottom of that rafter

1287
03:20:23,930 --> 03:20:32,969
which is kind of stupid. You take damage. I'm so slow. I'm gonna get just collapsed on here.

1288
03:20:33,850 --> 03:21:01,290
I don't know if I'll be able to kill this thing. I will try. Oh my lord no way. I can only turn

1289
03:21:01,290 --> 03:21:12,280
into a box so many times. Oh you've only got to do 22,000 more HP damage. That's not very much.

1290
03:21:13,319 --> 03:21:18,040
No like each shot does 198. So somebody just map that out real quick. What the hell is this

1291
03:21:18,040 --> 03:21:24,469
thing doing up here? We'll find out how many basic shots you need. This is a cut. Okay where's the

1292
03:21:24,469 --> 03:21:36,090
boss? I'm just gonna try to get the no more spawning. Oh they're over there.

1293
03:21:41,020 --> 03:21:59,129
Oh that's probably it. That's it. That's it. You tried. You tried. I did. I really did try.

1294
03:21:59,930 --> 03:22:07,110
I'm gonna go back to uh go back to hunters. All right I'm gonna go back to multi the multi

1295
03:22:07,110 --> 03:22:16,659
tool. Can I pee? Yeah you want to take a pee break? Pee break would be good. Pee break. Time to pee.

1296
03:22:19,610 --> 03:22:20,569
Co-op pee break.

1297
03:22:25,290 --> 03:26:16,649
We'll be right back. Squad pee. I'm gonna refill my drink. I'm not back yet. Refill. All right

1298
03:26:23,370 --> 03:26:50,489
we are back. Sort of. Uh soda. Where are my ads? No ads. But uh tomorrow we're gonna we're not done.

1299
03:26:50,489 --> 03:26:55,450
We're gonna keep playing but just to let everybody know. Tomorrow is the scratch ticket stream

1300
03:26:56,389 --> 03:27:03,180
and the germa slots stream. If you didn't catch that from the last couple streams

1301
03:27:03,739 --> 03:27:28,500
should be fun. Let's try this again. You back? I don't think he's back. Let me take a look over here.

1302
03:27:28,500 --> 03:27:50,549
Uh let's try you again. Heart effects coming soon. Hey hey Midas was having some technical

1303
03:27:50,549 --> 03:28:07,750
difficulties. Midas was having technical difficulties. All right let's try this again.

1304
03:28:07,750 --> 03:28:08,950
You gave him a swirly.

1305
03:28:18,200 --> 03:28:32,090
Titanic Plains. Let's go. All right fast. I'm not being fast. This is a new have we done this first?

1306
03:28:32,649 --> 03:28:45,100
I feel like we've done that same uh area first every time. Well that hurt. Oh hi hide in the egg.

1307
03:28:45,100 --> 03:28:51,129
What happens if you never leave? Can you take damage in the egg? You just stay in the pod.

1308
03:28:51,129 --> 03:29:04,020
Yeah if you stay in the pod till ha ha ha. What happens? Maybe an achievement. You just win.

1309
03:29:04,020 --> 03:29:14,899
All right I prayed to the mountain. This is level one on easy. We can go for it. 40 bucks

1310
03:29:14,899 --> 03:29:34,180
couple of canisters down there. Give me something. This is huge. Oh that's new. Turn invisible when

1311
03:29:34,180 --> 03:29:44,729
you take heavy damage. Two in a row baby. Nice. I got the ukulele from a luck shrine. That's good.

1312
03:29:44,729 --> 03:29:57,930
That's good to start with definitely. That's pretty sweet. Okay 54. Give me some long range

1313
03:29:57,930 --> 03:30:06,440
supporting fire. It's a healing drone. Give me. Those things are very useful. Look at his little

1314
03:30:06,440 --> 03:30:15,850
shield. All right hold on. I need to give Midas his treat. Yeah Midas. All right there's a ton

1315
03:30:15,850 --> 03:30:25,940
of boxes over here. Where are the enemies? Where are the enemies? I believe they are flying in the

1316
03:30:25,940 --> 03:30:36,020
sky. There's two of them. Three boxes over here. Yep. Like you said. Yeah there's just no way to

1317
03:30:36,020 --> 03:30:50,250
get money. There we go. Faster attack speed. Nice. Give me that like three or four times. Yeah I

1318
03:30:50,250 --> 03:30:59,129
think faster attack speed would be a game saver. Keep right clicking for some reason. We might

1319
03:30:59,129 --> 03:31:04,950
consider turning it on. Do we know where it is right here? No but we gotta go looking for it.

1320
03:31:05,909 --> 03:31:15,989
It should be. I see it. It's over here. Thank you SIG for the uh SIG Buur for the five community subs.

1321
03:31:16,629 --> 03:31:27,909
Thank you. Thank you SIG. Appreciate it. Dropping five subs. Attack speed is awesome. Oh by the way

1322
03:31:27,909 --> 03:31:33,860
I activated the mountain thing. I did. I was standing right next to you. What I activated the

1323
03:31:33,860 --> 03:31:39,059
mountain thing? Oh I thought you meant activated the. No we got the uh we got two of them because

1324
03:31:39,059 --> 03:31:59,159
of that. Extra rewards. It was worth it. This piercing? Wow. Oh that hurt. Yeah these fire

1325
03:31:59,159 --> 03:32:15,020
enemies gotta go. Oh oh oh this is going so well until about five seconds ago. Geez. Heal me bot.

1326
03:32:15,020 --> 03:32:42,020
How are we doing? We're okay. Back? Okay. Whoops. Oh god. I'm so sorry. I got cocky. Sorry. I'm

1327
03:32:42,020 --> 03:32:57,690
really cocky. All right I guess I get the one on the right. One with less health. One down. We're

1328
03:32:57,690 --> 03:33:03,750
gonna get four items aren't we? Uh I don't know. Do you get I guess you should get something for

1329
03:33:03,750 --> 03:33:07,270
beating the uh the mountain challenge right? Yeah you just do but we'll just double it up.

1330
03:33:08,809 --> 03:33:18,899
I don't know. There it is. Yeah there's four. We're gonna do rock paper scissors over who gets

1331
03:33:18,899 --> 03:33:24,100
the yellow. Well the yellow is just the beetle so it's beneficial to both of us. Um hold an

1332
03:33:24,100 --> 03:33:30,549
additional equipment charge. That's really good. Do you have an equipment? Because I don't. I do

1333
03:33:30,549 --> 03:33:39,719
not but well uh you grab the beetle then. You have like the buddy because you're slower so it looks

1334
03:33:39,719 --> 03:33:50,709
I am very slow. It's nice to have some backup. All right now we look for boxes. Coin? Where's the coin?

1335
03:33:50,709 --> 03:33:55,670
Oh there's a coin right there. Yeah there was a coin. How many do you have? I have two. All right.

1336
03:33:55,670 --> 03:33:59,670
All right ready? You got it. Rock paper scissors shoot. What'd you put on? I have three. Oh you can

1337
03:33:59,750 --> 03:34:06,979
have it. Thanks I would. Thanks I win. All right anything else? I see a couple of things right

1338
03:34:06,979 --> 03:34:18,170
here isn't active. All right I got three charges of the cube. That's pretty good. Is there a box

1339
03:34:18,170 --> 03:34:30,120
back here? Wasting time. And this is actually really good. Yeah we should probably just get

1340
03:34:30,120 --> 03:34:35,559
out of here then. Oops I forgot to look in the different. I didn't know what bustling fungus was

1341
03:34:35,559 --> 03:34:44,229
anyways. Now I know. Never pick the fungus. Cube. Uh any more boxes over by you that are not open?

1342
03:34:44,229 --> 03:34:52,979
Um not that I see yet. I don't see any either. It's good for a special build. Ooh there's one

1343
03:34:52,979 --> 03:34:59,940
more box up here that I'm going to get. Grab it because we're about to be medium. Going as fast

1344
03:34:59,940 --> 03:35:15,959
as my little wheels will carry me. Let's go boss damage. Ready? Yep. One two three go. He's grabbing

1345
03:35:15,959 --> 03:35:35,930
me. Cube is the best item in the game is it? Let's make this quick. 100. Turrets are not the station

1346
03:35:35,930 --> 03:35:40,090
the stationary turrets are really not that great because they just stay in the same spot and they

1347
03:35:40,090 --> 03:35:48,780
don't come with you. The healing ones and the little floaty guys they do. I guess maybe in some

1348
03:35:48,780 --> 03:36:02,409
scenarios it's not a bad idea. Is there no key item anymore? Was there you had to get a key in

1349
03:36:02,409 --> 03:36:16,940
the first one? I guess. How much does this cost? 72 dollars. Well I can't believe they're charging

1350
03:36:16,940 --> 03:36:32,149
that for an early access game. 72 again. Outrageous. All right 71 72. I'm taking it. I'm gonna take it.

1351
03:36:36,500 --> 03:36:47,219
That's good. There's another box here for 72. Another one there. Boss damage. I'm gonna go this way. I love my little

1352
03:36:47,219 --> 03:36:59,340
shield on my rope it. Nice sight there. Um praying to the shrine of the mountain. Oh god you're bold

1353
03:37:01,139 --> 03:37:16,379
Very bold. Go big or go home. 116. 72. Yeah. I want to go up there and get the money machine.

1354
03:37:17,260 --> 03:37:40,940
Sticky bomb. Oops I missed that one. That was a misclick. Got more boss damage. Any sights on the

1355
03:37:40,940 --> 03:37:57,579
thing? Uh I see orange. I see orange. It's like in this area. Here it is. Uh you ready? Um I guess.

1356
03:37:58,299 --> 03:38:04,260
I need to give you some boxes. I've had I got some. I'm uh kind of far away. It seems like I have a lot more items.

1357
03:38:05,579 --> 03:38:14,219
Um you kind of do but that's all good. Um I'm gonna activate this. I got 140 bucks now. I think

1358
03:38:14,219 --> 03:38:21,780
there's another box over here. Right. Where's there where's there a box? I got money. I'm saying right

1359
03:38:21,780 --> 03:38:31,319
on the thing when you're ready. I need one box. Ah just do it. All right it's gonna be the super

1360
03:38:31,319 --> 03:38:39,110
one so good luck. Yep. Stone two stone titans. Oh that's gonna be that's gonna be nutty.

1361
03:38:42,280 --> 03:38:48,649
I should do really good boss damage though. I should. Whoa where's the other one? Did we even

1362
03:38:48,649 --> 03:38:54,139
get another one? Yeah he's up on the rocks left there. Let's try to kill the one on the bottom

1363
03:38:54,139 --> 03:39:19,500
first. See if we can just get rid of him. He's like stuck. Geb just deflected my own. We'll get him.

1364
03:39:19,500 --> 03:39:35,770
He's going down. Dead. All right one down. Now the one's up top right? Yep. Well I can't. That's

1365
03:39:35,770 --> 03:39:43,979
oh okay there's already boss loot. So I picked up one. There's more though. I almost just steam

1366
03:39:43,979 --> 03:39:50,760
rolled over all the boss loot. Well at least somebody would. I was in my speed mode. I'm

1367
03:39:50,760 --> 03:40:03,000
getting hit. We get it. That's double. We got double loot twice. Yep. That means we should do

1368
03:40:03,000 --> 03:40:07,079
fairly decent this time. All right I think they're all the same so I'm just gonna take two and you

1369
03:40:07,079 --> 03:40:13,989
can have the other two. It's invisibility on heavy damage. Okay so how heavy does it have to be?

1370
03:40:14,709 --> 03:40:19,510
I don't know. It seems fairly generous. Well for you to stack it I mean. Does it make the attacks

1371
03:40:19,510 --> 03:40:30,870
lighter? All right we got money. Let's move to pick up some stuff. Yeah. It's generous. It is. Okay

1372
03:40:30,870 --> 03:40:39,190
that's good. Come on give me something. There was another shrine to the mountain. Oh there were two.

1373
03:40:41,819 --> 03:40:50,069
It's technically random damage. That's weird. Yeah I found the secret box stash up here.

1374
03:40:50,709 --> 03:41:07,260
Is this a box? Yes it is. More sticky bombs. Drop healing orb. Good. This is a luck shrine. What is this?

1375
03:41:09,579 --> 03:41:17,180
Nice. So um when you get a war banner again does it just make the war banner even better?

1376
03:41:18,889 --> 03:41:27,610
Probably. It was a 137 dollar uh luck shrine that I primed for you if you wanted. Where is it? 137.

1377
03:41:27,610 --> 03:41:35,719
I marked it. Dude I have. I failed twice in a row. I have so many drones. I have one two three four

1378
03:41:35,719 --> 03:41:47,979
five like five drones. All right I'm coming to you for it. Three healing drones and two gunner drones.

1379
03:41:50,979 --> 03:42:02,219
Nothing. All right I'm going. Yeah activate it. Yep. Going home. Oh there's a blood shrine up there too.

1380
03:42:02,219 --> 03:42:08,790
Can I get it before we go? Nope. Don't even need it. I got it. No I didn't. Shit.

1381
03:42:11,190 --> 03:42:32,780
Damn it. All right let's move. Look at the money. Quick money. 120. Get the timed box. Is it oh

1382
03:42:32,780 --> 03:42:37,829
it's a timed box. We have like we have like 40 seconds to get it. Where is it? Where is it? I

1383
03:42:37,829 --> 03:42:43,879
don't know. It's in like a. Is it over here? I think I saw it here before. How many seconds?

1384
03:42:44,760 --> 03:42:51,559
Is it too late? No it's minus 4 30 for this time box. Oh. We're uh it has to be 10 minutes.

1385
03:42:52,360 --> 03:43:01,209
Oh we were close. Somebody said it sucks anyways. No. I don't know if that's true. Maybe they just

1386
03:43:01,209 --> 03:43:07,350
said that to make us feel better. Maybe. Somebody said I thought it was 15 for co-op but apparently

1387
03:43:07,350 --> 03:43:25,909
not I guess. And all right it's more healing outside of danger. What is this? This the luck one?

1388
03:43:25,909 --> 03:43:31,430
No that's the other shrine thing. I'm gonna go look for it just so we can know where it is

1389
03:43:31,430 --> 03:43:50,620
because we're only on hard. This is not terrible. Look at all my little buddies flying in. You're

1390
03:43:50,620 --> 03:44:20,180
annoying. Die. Bleed damage or super banner three. These crits are insane when they hit. They hit

1391
03:44:20,180 --> 03:44:26,020
pretty frequently. Lots of money too. All right money. What is this? Reactivate fan.

1392
03:44:27,030 --> 03:44:36,299
Oh rapidly heal outside danger. That's a pretty good amount of shit over here.

1393
03:44:37,530 --> 03:44:53,559
242. Oh faster. I want some more damage. I have a lot of weird utility upgrades.

1394
03:44:54,889 --> 03:44:57,450
Oh I'll go this way. Another large blocks up here right.

1395
03:44:59,989 --> 03:45:12,260
Oops that should be enough to get something. Oh glasses. New reactivity fan again. I've got

1396
03:45:12,260 --> 03:45:18,649
rid of mushrooms for glasses. That's pretty odd. Hey there's a glass. I'm just gonna get

1397
03:45:18,649 --> 03:45:25,030
rid of everything for glasses. Can I do that over and over again? I don't know.

1398
03:45:29,030 --> 03:45:37,139
There goes the knife. Thought I could get him. There goes I don't know what that is.

1399
03:45:37,860 --> 03:45:43,989
Probably should go up. All right four pairs of sunglasses. You have four pairs of sunglasses.

1400
03:45:43,989 --> 03:45:52,149
Ten glasses 100% crit. So what you're at like 40% chance to crit? Yeah I'm at 50% right now.

1401
03:45:52,149 --> 03:45:57,989
I'm going to I'm going for 100% crit chance. I'm just getting rid of everything. Oh my god. All

1402
03:45:57,989 --> 03:46:04,459
right. You have to experiment. It's the glass's chest. Duplicate the same item seven times in a

1403
03:46:04,459 --> 03:46:13,100
row. All right that should be all of them right. Is this bugged? Yeah come on. That's bullshit.

1404
03:46:13,739 --> 03:46:20,739
There goes my banner. 150 gold to do it again. All right I have 10. So you have a you have a

1405
03:46:20,739 --> 03:46:27,860
100 chance to crit. That's correct. Well hopefully we can see the end of the game. No

1406
03:46:28,659 --> 03:46:41,290
that'd be nice. I don't know which is faster damage or not. Come on. I got it good. No I

1407
03:46:41,290 --> 03:46:49,290
have so many slugs. 100% unstoppable crit. I can only just die. I don't know what I had to give up

1408
03:46:49,290 --> 03:46:54,090
to get to this point. I have so many. How many slugs do I have? All right where's the stupid

1409
03:46:54,090 --> 03:47:13,059
thing? It's time. It is time. I don't see any up there that way. I got streamer eyes. I could see

1410
03:47:13,059 --> 03:47:29,209
it. Did you get the patch already? Yep. Oh I can die once. I'm allowed to die. Yeah it's up here.

1411
03:47:33,850 --> 03:47:41,129
Extra jump. Very nice. Up here. Oh got it. You want to turn it on? Get ready to go. Hold on I

1412
03:47:41,129 --> 03:47:50,100
got to come to you. Now if you can find harvester you heal every time you crit. That seems the same.

1413
03:47:50,100 --> 03:48:01,350
No that would be really good. There we go. All right I'm ready. One two three. Who is it? It's

1414
03:48:01,350 --> 03:48:14,059
the imp overlord. Imp overlord 20 000 health. Eat this. Just spam it all out there. Just eat it.

1415
03:48:14,700 --> 03:48:26,790
I don't know does that damage stack? I have a lot of like tingly crit noises going on. Tingly crit

1416
03:48:26,790 --> 03:48:36,680
sound. It's like it's like a sleet. It's like hail lightly falling on your tin roof. It looks really

1417
03:48:36,680 --> 03:48:40,120
cool. Look at the look at his health bar. Look at his health bar. Yeah you're just melting him.

1418
03:48:41,079 --> 03:49:02,950
Holy shit. He's dead. Well that's one way to do it. Whoa I almost just ran into that. We have a lot

1419
03:49:02,950 --> 03:49:14,040
of money though. I left the boss item for you. Thank you. That is yours. Okay uh we have we've

1420
03:49:14,040 --> 03:49:23,030
got a lot of money. I didn't see any boxes though. No you don't? No boxes? Really? Um just this one

1421
03:49:23,030 --> 03:49:29,110
right here. Literally just this one. Ah just grab it. I'm gonna just check down here one more time.

1422
03:49:29,110 --> 03:49:33,989
I gotta wait until we teleport charge because otherwise we'll never be able to pick them up.

1423
03:49:35,110 --> 03:49:41,690
Wait does my lightning crit too for the ukulele? That's a fan. I'll stay here in charge while you

1424
03:49:41,690 --> 03:49:56,649
search. There's a canister here. Nothing. There's a timed one. Uh yeah I got one here. What is it

1425
03:49:56,649 --> 03:50:07,500
what we want? This one. More boss damage. What else? Anything else? What about inside here?

1426
03:50:07,500 --> 03:50:25,510
I gotta increase attack speed. Oh are you? Not yet. Hold on. Okay I got a crit chance.

1427
03:50:26,309 --> 03:50:33,930
There's like one no. Double crowbars. So oh wait that's gonna stack. Deal more damage to healthy

1428
03:50:33,930 --> 03:50:43,959
enemies with super crit is gonna stack for sure. I got the gamer glasses now. Whoops. So now me go

1429
03:50:43,959 --> 03:50:52,180
get 10 glasses? Wait can I use that machine that you were using? You can but you have to give up.

1430
03:50:53,139 --> 03:50:59,350
Random stuff. Well. So it could ruin your build potentially. I mean my build I don't really have

1431
03:50:59,350 --> 03:51:12,360
one. How many do I have right now? All right he's like a sticky bomb. So I have like sticky bombs.

1432
03:51:12,360 --> 03:51:19,399
Let's do it. Let's be let's be the crit brothers. Crit brothers. Super lens glasses. How many do you

1433
03:51:19,399 --> 03:51:34,600
need? Ten for a hundred. Yeah get rid of the slugs. All right I'm at 60 percent. 70 percent.

1434
03:51:37,879 --> 03:51:45,020
Oh I lost a pretty good item. Well might as well just go. Oh my god I lost two of them. All right.

1435
03:51:46,059 --> 03:51:50,379
Uh oh. Was it worth it? It's not worth it but with both 100 percent crit.

1436
03:51:51,100 --> 03:51:57,020
Let's go. What'd you lose? Uh everything. Everything. You have to say it dramatically.

1437
03:51:57,579 --> 03:52:07,979
Everything. All right get us out of here. I lost uh two boss damage things and I lost some really

1438
03:52:08,860 --> 03:52:15,340
Is it possible to get 11 of an item? 110 percent crit. That's kind of how would that work?

1439
03:52:16,520 --> 03:52:20,889
You ready? Somebody said that's yeah there's the reference for this stream.

1440
03:52:23,959 --> 03:52:32,229
True ride or die. All crit all the time. Yeah let's see. Okay let's just not get popped here.

1441
03:52:32,229 --> 03:52:37,270
Just don't instantly die. 121 damage a hit. Oh holy shit this is actually pretty ridiculous.

1442
03:52:38,790 --> 03:52:45,799
Uh we should do fairly well. We should yeah I mean you have auto aim and auto crit so like

1443
03:52:46,520 --> 03:53:04,149
all you have to do is sprint. In theory. I don't have enough money here. This dinosaur used to be

1444
03:53:04,149 --> 03:53:26,920
so obnoxious now. All right 157 225. Let's get it. Stupid fucking heal. Extra damage to bosses.

1445
03:53:26,920 --> 03:53:33,079
That's what you want. Oh I thought your guy was a bad guy. Yeah I did the same thing all the time.

1446
03:53:34,200 --> 03:53:40,360
Another stupid healing slug. Two in a row. Oh I uh see the dust. If you want to rush before we

1447
03:53:40,360 --> 03:53:48,579
get to impossible. Uh we probably should. I mean at this point we're almost at impossible.

1448
03:53:49,219 --> 03:53:59,879
What do we need to activate this? 150. 150. All right uh you ready? Uh yeah might as well just do

1449
03:53:59,879 --> 03:54:23,450
it. All right crit. It is the stone titan. He does do a lot of damage. He does do a lot but if we

1450
03:54:23,450 --> 03:54:30,780
all DPS him it should be fine. There's other people fucking flying around here too. No bad.

1451
03:54:30,780 --> 03:54:51,340
Very bad. Very bad. I gotta get out. All right one's dead. Need these heal bots. Holy shit. Melt

1452
03:54:51,340 --> 03:55:08,860
them. Melt them. Your turn. I need a breather. There's so much going on. It's like a rate. Like

1453
03:55:08,860 --> 03:55:25,219
an wow rate. Oh fuck man. He's spamming that at me. He's dead. Oh wow nice. I'm almost dead.

1454
03:55:27,079 --> 03:55:34,549
Thank you heal bots for keeping me alive. How many do you have? Uh I think they're yours. I think

1455
03:55:34,549 --> 03:55:40,139
they're like I got hours. I have three. They're very very helpful. All three of them can heal me

1456
03:55:40,139 --> 03:55:53,799
as well as you. Do the heals crit? That'd be cool. What are we at? 87. All right now we got money.

1457
03:55:53,799 --> 03:55:57,879
We just went right through this man. No enemies. So we can spend some time here after this.

1458
03:55:57,879 --> 03:56:07,639
That was a good idea. Yeah. All right left uh your boss item and we each have like 1600 bucks.

1459
03:56:07,639 --> 03:56:19,030
Okay boss item is what is it? Another fuel cell god. All right what do we want to buy?

1460
03:56:20,469 --> 03:56:25,670
I don't know. It's like being a kid at the toy store. The whole map is available.

1461
03:56:26,389 --> 03:56:34,040
Okay more damage to health. Four rose bucklers right now. Does a missile drone follow you or is

1462
03:56:34,040 --> 03:56:39,959
it stationary? Like is it worth picking this up for the future or? Um I don't know. I know

1463
03:56:39,959 --> 03:56:46,969
the gunner follows you. I assume it follows you. Damn it. So we'll get another drone. I'll spend

1464
03:56:46,969 --> 03:57:01,139
my money on a stun grenade. A co-op. Damn it. Damn it. Yeah only the turrets follow okay.

1465
03:57:03,239 --> 03:57:09,159
Sunk cost fallacy. I know. I know. What is the sun? I lost all my money gambling.

1466
03:57:09,639 --> 03:57:16,500
Okay it's gone. You have 400. No well. Wait hold on. I might be able to whoops. Come on.

1467
03:57:17,540 --> 03:57:27,850
Come on. 176. 180. There's so many. I'm so stupid. Why did I gamble? I shouldn't have gambled. I

1468
03:57:27,850 --> 03:57:33,479
should not have done that. How much is it to gamble more? Like 500 something dollars. I need

1469
03:57:33,479 --> 03:57:41,299
there's like two. This two boxes right here like in between there. It makes you feel better. I

1470
03:57:41,299 --> 03:57:46,420
gambled and won on the first try. Yeah because I'm the old person that sat down and spent like

1471
03:57:46,420 --> 03:57:50,340
five thousand dollars here. The five hundred dollar one. That was at the one hundred and fifty dollar

1472
03:57:50,340 --> 03:58:02,600
one. None of these I can. 450. One lunar coin. These minimums are too high. All right I'm ready.

1473
03:58:02,600 --> 03:58:07,610
We got to go to some different tables. There's so many boxes here that I could have opened at

1474
03:58:07,610 --> 03:58:17,049
least two or three more boxes. I'm so upset with myself. What's this blue portal? I can win it back

1475
03:58:17,049 --> 03:58:27,100
just you wait. Do you hit the blue portal or the teleporter chat? Blue portal. Stay alive for 30

1476
03:58:27,100 --> 03:58:33,610
minutes. Blue portal. The portal goes to a shop world. We just spent all of our money. What?

1477
03:58:34,170 --> 03:58:42,020
Let's go to the shop world and at least see the new stuff. I have a hundred. Well we don't have

1478
03:58:42,020 --> 03:58:50,729
any money. Do not do blue yet. Somebody just said in all caps. Well we're not. We don't have to buy

1479
03:58:50,729 --> 03:58:54,809
anything here. We can look. I just fell down. What's happening? I fell off the fucking mountain. What

1480
03:58:54,809 --> 03:59:02,790
happened? Hello? Hi. You okay down there? I don't know. I just went off. Do I have to go down? Am I

1481
03:59:02,790 --> 03:59:10,020
never gonna be able to come back up? I don't know. They didn't think about that when they made this

1482
03:59:10,020 --> 03:59:15,219
game 3D apparently. They're like what if somebody falls? Well it just like spawned me and I just

1483
03:59:15,219 --> 03:59:21,000
moved for a second. Well you can like can you die and I you can just spectate me because there's a

1484
03:59:21,000 --> 03:59:25,479
bunch of stuff people in chat do not want me to buy that cost lunar coins. Okay I technically

1485
03:59:25,479 --> 03:59:36,700
should have probably. Where am I now? Okay. Reforge items. I'm back so we can forge. Where to fight

1486
03:59:36,700 --> 03:59:43,079
this guy? Hold on is this the character? He has a health bar. Is this the character in the ice right

1487
03:59:43,079 --> 03:59:47,590
here with the 10 lunar coins? I think you have to have 10 lunar to unlock this character. This

1488
03:59:47,590 --> 03:59:54,729
character? Yeah on the right. He's right where he says 10 lunar and he's in a block of ice.

1489
03:59:54,729 --> 04:00:03,399
What about the dragon? The dragon is like he's selling him. He's like the slaver. Reforge five

1490
04:00:03,399 --> 04:00:11,819
items. Dare you. No why would I do that? Look is it still counting? Why is it counting in the shop?

1491
04:00:11,819 --> 04:00:16,219
Uh oh I'm coming for you. This shouldn't be counting in the shop. Time should freeze. The whole

1492
04:00:16,219 --> 04:00:26,010
game is time. This is one big stopwatch. No I can't. I was gonna do one shot and then run.

1493
04:00:26,010 --> 04:00:36,379
All right we're going back. This is all too too confusing for us at the moment. We apparently

1494
04:00:36,379 --> 04:00:40,299
it's bad to buy anything with lunar coins until you get this lunar character.

1495
04:00:40,299 --> 04:00:43,100
So we shouldn't buy anything till we actually get to unlock the guy in the ice.

1496
04:00:47,430 --> 04:00:53,350
We have cycled right? Technically. So that's like the kind of goal right now is lunar coins.

1497
04:00:53,350 --> 04:01:02,870
Right so stop missing them. Basically. This game's gonna feel so much worse later when we

1498
04:01:02,870 --> 04:01:08,469
don't crit every single attack. I'm just realizing this now. What that we've completely ruined the

1499
04:01:08,469 --> 04:01:14,299
game? We've ruined the game for ourselves. There's a jellyfish boss just hanging out. I guess the

1500
04:01:14,299 --> 04:01:18,540
first level enemies are gonna feel so easy that it's like we have perma crits right?

1501
04:01:19,500 --> 04:01:31,190
Top them like that. Doesn't he do the big explosion thing? Yes. We need to be aware of that.

1502
04:01:31,829 --> 04:01:45,500
We might just kill him first though. Oh it's happening now. All right we did it. 700 bucks.

1503
04:01:46,540 --> 04:01:54,459
Damn. Too bad all the chests are like 350. Let's go on a goddamn opening spree. Another healing

1504
04:01:54,459 --> 04:02:09,530
drone. Question mark or? Firely. Bombs on enemies. We'll go bombs. Dude I'm just the healer. I marked

1505
04:02:09,530 --> 04:02:17,420
the teleporter for future reference. Okay let's start opening boxes. No another one. Should I

1506
04:02:17,420 --> 04:02:26,819
is it uh should I just have like 10 healing drones? I will never die. I'm gonna do it.

1507
04:02:33,540 --> 04:02:43,430
I have too many healing drones. Let's fight. I am over by the teleporter when you want

1508
04:02:44,309 --> 04:02:47,930
to go. Yeah I'm coming over here now. Uh yeah let's just do it. Might as well

1509
04:02:49,260 --> 04:02:58,520
get it going. There's another drone another heal drone here. I have one two three four five five

1510
04:02:59,079 --> 04:03:04,620
can I get do I have six healing drones? I have a lot. Let's put it that way. Well I got another one.

1511
04:03:04,620 --> 04:03:10,379
All right good. We've got a full party on the left. I don't think they're even on the screen

1512
04:03:10,379 --> 04:03:16,059
anymore because there's too many of them. All right what's it gonna be? I can't even count how

1513
04:03:16,059 --> 04:03:29,959
many drones we have. How many? Two three four. Oh he's dying real fast. I'll take the one on the

1514
04:03:29,959 --> 04:03:43,110
left. All right let's see you can kill him faster. It's gonna be you. Mine's dead.

1515
04:03:45,690 --> 04:03:51,540
That like rapid okay we got a lot of fucking niddies but hold on I can't suck them out of

1516
04:03:51,540 --> 04:03:57,899
their little tubes. I can stay invisible for so long. They're going all the way across the map.

1517
04:03:58,780 --> 04:04:07,399
All right the bosses are dead now I just have to not give me that give me this. What's wrong with

1518
04:04:07,719 --> 04:04:22,780
me? Found a coin. Wow all right we're pretty good at this game now and I want to savor this moment.

1519
04:04:23,340 --> 04:04:26,379
Savor it savor the moment of the fact that this is probably the only run we're going to like be

1520
04:04:26,379 --> 04:04:32,969
able to do this more than once. Be like gods. This is like when you finally get that Isaac run

1521
04:04:33,610 --> 04:04:37,049
where you just walk into the room you push the fire button everything dies.

1522
04:04:37,930 --> 04:04:45,079
Kind of. Did you uh did I get it did you pick up the item? Nope okay get it. I forget if I wait

1523
04:04:45,079 --> 04:04:50,760
did I? Maybe not but you actually you know what you should be picking if there's like damage items

1524
04:04:50,760 --> 04:04:55,219
they should be going to you if I'm completely honest. Well the pandalir is just ammo pack to

1525
04:04:55,219 --> 04:05:01,620
reset cooldowns which is more your yeah but I kind of just do dps but you're if they're like

1526
04:05:01,620 --> 04:05:05,219
do more damage to boss if those bullets show up that you should be taking them.

1527
04:05:08,379 --> 04:05:13,579
I'm invisible for so long after damaging the all the heal bots swirling around this chaos I love it.

1528
04:05:14,379 --> 04:05:26,229
All right let's go time to loot. I will go the other way. Oh five bucklers that reduce damage

1529
04:05:26,229 --> 04:05:37,299
while sprinting is pretty cool. Anybody see anything? Uh shrine of chance. Gunner. I had

1530
04:05:37,299 --> 04:05:48,680
to do it. I did. Oh god. Sorry. Just move faster out of combat I think I already have a couple of

1531
04:05:48,680 --> 04:06:05,110
these. I also got that. This is very fast. Can't lose them all. Going for broke at the casino.

1532
04:06:07,829 --> 04:06:24,360
Me too. I got a fucking what is it okay what is going on? Who's dropped who is dropping this

1533
04:06:24,360 --> 04:06:36,600
shit all over me? Okay all right I activated another drone for fun so that's all my money.

1534
04:06:38,649 --> 04:06:45,610
I got faster sprint. Ready? I'm ready. Did you get a squeak? Yeah what was that? It's like the soft

1535
04:06:45,610 --> 04:06:51,799
landing. I think chance to block incoming damage teddy bear squeak. People throwing rocks down at

1536
04:06:51,799 --> 04:07:04,600
us. Yeah I thought I just died. This game is just laughing its ass off at us. It is. It's going to

1537
04:07:04,600 --> 04:07:09,239
have to send enemies with enough HP that it's okay if they get cribbed every single time. What have

1538
04:07:09,239 --> 04:07:24,090
we got in here? Stun. None of these are worth it. Where's the casino over here? Did we? No we do

1539
04:07:24,090 --> 04:07:36,840
not dare activate the scary thing right? No no way. Probably not. I mean we could. No no this is

1540
04:07:36,840 --> 04:07:43,239
such a good run. Let's play it safe. We need to play this safe. We have to like try to get like high

1541
04:07:43,239 --> 04:07:51,559
as high as we can. That hurt. Well we're in the right city to do that. That probably if I didn't

1542
04:07:51,559 --> 04:07:58,809
have the heavy damage thing that probably would have been an instant kill. I would have dead. 400

1543
04:07:58,809 --> 04:08:14,180
what's in here uh the unknown the unknown sure it's gasoline man the gambling is getting

1544
04:08:14,180 --> 04:08:24,579
significantly more expensive yeah it is the super crates are almost a thousand each uh the

1545
04:08:24,579 --> 04:08:36,340
teleporters over here this way we can activate it if you'd like to do it and then run around

1546
04:08:37,059 --> 04:08:40,260
but uh there's like a fire elite enemy over here it's gonna be a big pain in the ass

1547
04:08:41,059 --> 04:08:48,809
hold on i just want to open one of these boxes then i'll be ready yeah this guy right here is

1548
04:08:48,809 --> 04:09:04,250
gonna die okay i'm ready this like fire okay yeah yeah yeah yeah oh dead instantly holy shit i'm

1549
04:09:04,250 --> 04:09:10,440
dead instantly okay yeah that was a 100 health kill did you come back to life yeah i got had

1550
04:09:10,440 --> 04:09:13,719
the item that maybe brought me back you gotta kill we gotta kill that fire thing

1551
04:09:14,979 --> 04:09:32,780
jesus i ain't fucking around with that anymore dude bye just oh my god look at this aoe are you

1552
04:09:32,780 --> 04:09:45,370

1553
04:09:45,370 --> 04:09:50,329
just activate the thing where is it you might as well just activate it no you have 1200 health

1554
04:09:50,329 --> 04:10:02,709
that's right yeah because that thing was one hit killing me it is it where is it uh but it's

1555
04:10:03,270 --> 04:10:08,329
things below you but it's like to the bottom left below yeah down there it's like underneath

1556
04:10:08,329 --> 04:10:19,239
there yeah so much is that fire guy still alive maybe it might be able to do it you have like

1557
04:10:19,239 --> 04:10:34,139
100% crits it's possible oh my god the drones stay right so even all the drones that were

1558
04:10:34,139 --> 04:10:42,219
purchased get to stick around i spent my whole life savings on all these healing drones i hope

1559
04:10:42,219 --> 04:11:05,420
they help you can i go under here no that's too thick holy shit 58 you're doing like 600

1560
04:11:05,420 --> 04:11:18,540
damage a shot with that thing wow you might actually do this if you you know me that's at

1561
04:11:18,540 --> 04:11:31,719
36 it's gonna be hard but if it is very possible if you just kill both bosses and just oh there's

1562
04:11:31,719 --> 04:11:42,969
three you do so much fucking damage though you really do i don't have any more healers

1563
04:11:43,690 --> 04:11:51,139
they're just spotting so many around me they're there the drone army is being

1564
04:11:51,139 --> 04:12:00,200
depleted there's only three about two hit drone army is gone two left out of uh like 12

1565
04:12:01,079 --> 04:12:06,379
i'll just go this way and cruise for a minute if that's cool

1566
04:12:08,139 --> 04:12:14,920
i'm gonna hang out over here on the lovely side of the map you had like 20 what you leveled up

1567
04:12:14,920 --> 04:12:25,399
why would yeah but oh my god oh hi oh if only he had some slugs he'd be doing just fun if only

1568
04:12:25,399 --> 04:12:33,750
i had any healing survivability whatsoever there are two healing drones somewhere apparently

1569
04:12:34,889 --> 04:12:36,809
are they like stuck somewhere because they have full health

1570
04:12:48,489 --> 04:13:00,219
oh we knew it was coming yeah we knew it was coming that was still pretty good that was still

1571
04:13:00,219 --> 04:13:10,200
fun yeah we made the loop so how do we unlock the other uh three characters let's take a look at

1572
04:13:10,200 --> 04:13:20,500
the main menu yeah let's see because we got one of them complete 30 stages is the other one

1573
04:13:20,500 --> 04:13:27,739
we should be on the way itself requires pause what the hell is obliterate yourself at the obelisk

1574
04:13:27,739 --> 04:13:39,959
mean okay i'm gonna have to mute for a second because uh mute for a second where does he go

1575
04:13:41,350 --> 04:13:49,030
uh but uh what does that mean what does that mean what do you do you have to get to stage seven to

1576
04:13:49,030 --> 04:13:55,670
spawn a portal you unlock four of them by just playing normally the other two require you to

1577
04:13:55,670 --> 04:14:05,989
spend 10 lunar coins and get to stage seven okay obliterate is completing a run will we just on

1578
04:14:07,290 --> 04:14:25,000
level seven you kill yourself in a portal okay that was six we should do this pretty soon though

1579
04:14:25,000 --> 04:14:44,739
i wish it showed you how many you've done can i see that information to feed the teleporter

1580
04:14:44,739 --> 04:14:56,280
boss in under 15 seconds uh there's more page defeat 3000 enemies reach 300 move speed

1581
04:14:57,479 --> 04:15:07,129
some crazy things are crazy things are happening yeah what are you good what happened um

1582
04:15:08,170 --> 04:15:22,489
somebody just misclicked and uh gave 100 gifts up oh a hundred subs oh good nice holy shit that's

1583
04:15:22,489 --> 04:15:38,780
fucking crazy a hundred a hundred i can't refund they're mine now complete 30 stages so we're

1584
04:15:39,860 --> 04:15:52,170
we'll probably get this 30 stage thing uh probably next or one or two more maybe

1585
04:15:56,569 --> 04:16:16,040
italics has asked you to play risk of rain i'll try i'll try it i've heard it was pretty fun all

1588
04:16:41,860 --> 04:16:55,100
don't like the move set yeah i enjoyed getting super crits as multi but um we could do double

1589
04:16:55,100 --> 04:17:02,790
huntress probably not a big deal i haven't played huntress in a while i would like to try it

1590
04:17:04,920 --> 04:17:26,729
yeah let's do double hunter okay all right let's let's go hurt yourself shrine got it

1594
04:18:43,739 --> 04:18:49,530
face cam i really haven't been doing it much this stream either games like this are really good for

1595
04:18:49,530 --> 04:18:54,569
it because you're like your tongue is being chewed between your teeth and you're like we're trying

1596
04:18:54,569 --> 04:19:00,329
hard yeah you just like you mashing down on your tongue you guys want to see me just fucking chewing

1598
04:19:13,850 --> 04:19:25,879

1599
04:19:25,879 --> 04:19:51,639
the best damn it that's a drone 55 ah all right let's do it is it right there oh jesus what the

1600
04:19:51,639 --> 04:20:09,659
hell happened here he's having a bad hair day the jewel the joke there is every day is a bad hair

1601
04:20:09,659 --> 04:20:23,319
day right um so we ready i'm ready i'm turning it on all right let's do it it is jellyfish

1602
04:20:32,260 --> 04:20:37,700
kind of a bad place yeah well it's just a bad it's a bad enemy for us because we can't use our

1603
04:20:39,110 --> 04:20:46,709
fourth does this count as lines i don't think arrows hit right no they do they do i hope these

1604
04:20:46,709 --> 04:21:07,780
count as line of sight you're doing it whoo don't do it don't do it yeah the mouse too for this

1605
04:21:07,780 --> 04:21:19,159
class is amazing oh i thought he was doing the super that didn't hit it in what world are you

1606
04:21:19,159 --> 04:21:38,790
doing it this is the super that almost insta kills me that's good oh what do you drop the hell is

1607
04:21:38,790 --> 04:21:43,750
this they're kind of in weird spots aren't they you link the image they're just like hanging out

1608
04:21:43,750 --> 04:22:06,040
up here that guy's too far away i don't care about uh what about any more boxes yeah we killed him

1609
04:22:06,040 --> 04:22:31,979
pretty slowly dude where are the boxes for this particular one down this way i mean we weren't

1610
04:22:31,979 --> 04:22:37,100
95 philabias is taking so oh yeah did we just we just so good at killing the boss i guess we

1611
04:22:37,100 --> 04:22:44,760
not just standing in the teleporter that whole time i feel like we've been here for way too long

1612
04:22:49,020 --> 04:23:04,819
there's so many stationary turrets on this one and nothing to spend yeah we just gotta go i'm

1613
04:23:04,819 --> 04:23:16,520
ready to hit it and you're ready uh one sec coin where's the coin coin the coin spawn randomly or

1614
04:23:16,520 --> 04:23:31,559
is there like one on every level i don't know i feel like it's random all right we're gonna

1615
04:23:31,559 --> 04:23:38,200
we're gonna be in medium on the second yeah i think i've spent as much as i can we get two of the

1616
04:23:38,200 --> 04:23:45,159
kind of slowest damage characters we might get screwed here yeah dps a little low we're going

1617
04:23:45,159 --> 04:23:58,120
to the desert though abandoned aqueduct is that a hurt yourself item no there's a fish item what

1618
04:23:58,120 --> 04:24:43,319
is it what's the fish do combat nope 67 dollars such a vast landscape and no money uh give me

1619
04:24:43,319 --> 04:25:15,350
something ah yeah i feel like this takes forever to kill anything we really did spoil ourselves so

1620
04:25:15,350 --> 04:25:26,459
bad critting every single time and then just like yeah yeah yeah yeah three four five dead

1621
04:25:26,459 --> 04:25:45,000
a lot of enemies over here i've got money now can i buy something oh what is the bottle flame

1622
04:25:45,639 --> 04:25:59,479
too expensive is what it is all right okay do you get the impression that some of these maps are

1623
04:25:59,479 --> 04:26:07,739
way too big sometimes yeah i feel like this these maps in particular are just enormous

1624
04:26:08,540 --> 04:26:20,100
and it doesn't really add anything um well it's probably a time thing right they make it bigger

1625
04:26:20,100 --> 04:26:26,500
because they want you to spend more time on this area i guess trying to figure out where to go

1626
04:26:39,860 --> 04:26:48,860
uh any sign of the teleporter yes i have a sign of the teleporter by me

1627
04:26:49,659 --> 04:27:03,139
don't want that don't i don't want any of those uh whenever i get like the bounce right click it's

1628
04:27:03,139 --> 04:27:16,569
like jubilantke this really is just smite welcome to smite uh you ready for the teleporter i guess

1629
04:27:16,569 --> 04:27:25,399
yeah kind of just hovering in its general area looking for a last box or two i still have money

1630
04:27:25,399 --> 04:27:46,459
but there's a lot of secrets on higher areas of maps uh i see uh at the tp let me turn it on you

1631
04:27:46,459 --> 04:27:53,100
seem to have spawned a lunar coin which i grabbed oh good how many do you have uh i have four

1632
04:27:53,899 --> 04:28:03,180
okay so i have five yeah we're pretty much even it's always this guy huh apparently

1633
04:28:09,780 --> 04:28:15,209
dying quicker than the last thing was there's a big elite beetle next to you oh yes there is

1634
04:28:19,100 --> 04:28:26,149
oh he's killing me too where's my healer oh god damn it i thought he was gonna say i thought

1635
04:28:26,149 --> 04:28:52,149
i was gonna run towards me yeah this guy refuses to die they're nice and group fighting two bosses

1636
04:29:05,100 --> 04:29:38,069
get up there that's the tether be careful almost got him this game is just kenshi with

1637
04:29:38,069 --> 04:29:49,780
teleporter it's what i don't even know what that means kenshi with teleport i don't even know what

1638
04:29:49,780 --> 04:29:56,090
that means is because it's a desert is that the that has to be the reference are there any more

1639
04:29:56,090 --> 04:30:06,569
boxes some lucky stones i guess that was a joke about another person's comparison now i see

1640
04:30:07,209 --> 04:30:28,280
i don't see anything over here nothing if you have 242 it's almost a guaranteed lucky shrine

1641
04:30:28,280 --> 04:30:43,030
up here almost guaranteed i got 700 i'll try i'll give it a whirl no well hey i got an extra jump

1642
04:30:43,670 --> 04:31:02,389
hopu feather attack speed good is this 160 come on yes let me know when you're ready because i

1643
04:31:02,389 --> 04:31:13,750
spent all my money gambling i am ready i have two of those bucklers so is that just straight up like

1644
04:31:13,750 --> 04:31:22,840
10 damage reduction 20 um i don't know it's a chance it just says reduces while sprinting i

1645
04:31:22,840 --> 04:31:40,870
don't know what the percentage is 127 yeah we have such a little dps yeah we're already on hard

1646
04:31:42,069 --> 04:31:48,500
i want to get that other character though yeah we just have to complete stages right i guess

1647
04:31:48,500 --> 04:31:59,979
yeah we have we have to be close we were at least 70 plus percent of the way there did you could you

1648
04:31:59,979 --> 04:32:04,409
see how many we completed in the log it doesn't take you there's no number but it's like a bar

1649
04:32:05,659 --> 04:32:16,309
i see what i got money so i just need to stay sprinting the entire time

1650
04:32:17,030 --> 04:32:34,819
it's kind of hard to aim when you do that though when you beat 30 total levels i wonder what

1651
04:32:34,819 --> 04:32:56,200
jesus i wonder how far we are we probably at like 28 no bad oh god how did i end up in here

1652
04:32:58,549 --> 04:33:02,229
where are you oh there we go kind of just stuffed inside of that thing

1653
04:33:08,740 --> 04:33:23,930
opening a chest will launch fireworks oh okay i'm getting killed here i'm gonna get the hell out

1654
04:33:23,930 --> 04:33:43,259
of here there we go the fireworks is actually kind of cool even the little money chest huh

1655
04:33:43,259 --> 04:33:52,490
that's crazy the hell is on the ground here okay like 10 monster or environment logs good job

1656
04:33:52,490 --> 04:33:58,619
i feel like i'm getting destroyed you look like you're getting destroyed i'm just getting

1657
04:33:58,619 --> 04:34:15,049
hammered i'm kind of leaving you alone so it's also my fault but there's stuff up here that i

1658
04:34:15,049 --> 04:34:36,060
need and i have enough money to open something this is a big map isn't it just keeps going and

1659
04:34:36,060 --> 04:34:55,830
going all right i'm gambling again i'm going for it i'm gonna do it ready told you did you get it

1660
04:34:55,830 --> 04:35:07,240
i did all right we got it we're gonna we gotta go we're gonna die at this boss we this boss is

1661
04:35:07,240 --> 04:35:16,040
gonna fucking destroy us yes i cannot deny it but i did find the uh the spot at least i have

1662
04:35:16,040 --> 04:35:34,259
equipment yeah you ready uh where is the oh it's over there by you i was just over there yeah we're

1663
04:35:34,259 --> 04:35:52,860
in very hard mode now into uncharted territory yeah so the what is the red down arrow that's

1664
04:35:52,860 --> 04:36:03,419
stun or slow the red i think the red down arrows attack down maybe it was slow yeah maybe

1665
04:36:04,139 --> 04:36:15,240
i don't know all right let's do it pump it up might as well let's spawn the

1666
04:36:16,599 --> 04:36:24,169
it's the imp the imp overload apparently slow the teleporter oh shit oh that's a lot of people

1667
04:36:32,619 --> 04:36:37,180
so many lasers pointing across it's also difficult for the huntress to get kills because

1668
04:36:37,180 --> 04:36:45,880
the auto aim if any enemies get in between yeah it is you do that really good aoe though

1669
04:36:46,759 --> 04:36:53,020
yeah be very helpful and you can sprint faster than these like robot lasers can catch up to you

1670
04:36:53,900 --> 04:37:15,799
pretty much just sprint circle shoot oh damn it yeah we're doing so little damage it's funny

1671
04:37:19,049 --> 04:37:25,540
no well they're almost not spawning anymore so that's good yeah i mean the teleporter is

1672
04:37:25,540 --> 04:37:45,959
almost 99 then we just have to defeat the boss so it should be doable now almost dead

1673
04:37:47,000 --> 04:37:56,939
some of these balls running around okay 99 god damn always right when i do the aoe teleport

1674
04:37:57,659 --> 04:38:25,240
we're like at the halfway point it's like half dead our basic attacks is so pitiful

1675
04:38:27,060 --> 04:38:41,560
oh need a bop bop character need to bop bop did he go all the way across the map

1676
04:38:43,290 --> 04:38:51,349
uh he's all the way down here he went all the way down here time is still ticking too wait

1677
04:38:51,349 --> 04:39:03,669
teleporting back is he coming back hey teleporting bosses gotta love him what oh there he is he just

1678
04:39:03,669 --> 04:39:33,340
kind of fell oh die yeah double aoe doesn't mean a whole lot right now not really really with 75

1679
04:39:33,340 --> 04:39:40,700
left coming back to hell all right to be honest we should just go all right you get both of those

1680
04:39:41,419 --> 04:39:48,599
why i don't know because you have two of them already just get it what that that's something

1681
04:39:48,599 --> 04:39:54,919
that does uh explosions right detonate on kill yeah you got three of them now okay so there you

1682
04:39:54,919 --> 04:40:03,110
go so now you got three are we gonna stick around to loot or do we pretty much get everything um i

1683
04:40:03,110 --> 04:40:07,990
think we have solidified the fact that we're going to lose so i would say we should probably

1684
04:40:07,990 --> 04:40:14,310
just complete it and try to complete the next one and you know try to unlock the other character

1685
04:40:15,110 --> 04:40:23,189
that's what i would say hey well i found a couple boxes you tell me when you want to go but go ahead

1686
04:40:33,159 --> 04:40:42,419
we are going to be an insane i wonder no not yet we're gonna get on the next thing we do we're

1687
04:40:42,419 --> 04:40:48,729
gonna get it what what are you talking about on the next character on the next thing we're

1688
04:40:48,729 --> 04:40:56,169
gonna get it on the next cycle we should get the new character oh was that the 30th stage

1689
04:40:56,970 --> 04:41:08,229
not that one but we're very very very close huntress is worst class in my humble opinion

1690
04:41:18,979 --> 04:41:24,659
hunter seems like a really good class to not both be at the same time so i learned my lesson

1691
04:41:26,279 --> 04:41:38,860
maybe seems like a great support doesn't seem like a like a main yet i think we need to unlock

1692
04:41:38,860 --> 04:41:46,020
more items i think we need more cabbages you say cabbages we need more cabbages

1693
04:41:54,740 --> 04:41:59,270
every class but the huntress is the worst class true i'm gonna sneeze and i have no way to meet

1694
04:41:59,270 --> 04:42:15,540
up society oh again last second no sneeze is always coming pairs though they do and you're

1695
04:42:15,540 --> 04:42:25,139
right because here comes another one thank you i'm trying to eat it i can't it's hard to eat a

1696
04:42:25,139 --> 04:42:43,799
sneeze i can't kill anything there's no there's no enemies character need to buff

1697
04:42:52,939 --> 04:43:02,520
it happened it worked oh it worked they heard my cries whoops wrong buttons those are all the

1698
04:43:02,520 --> 04:43:10,939
wrong buttons well that's a big guy whoa you go big guy i'm gonna come back and help you

1699
04:43:11,740 --> 04:43:35,849
i try to get away post for the fans oh boy i'm dead i'm dead i'm dead boy you're dead now i'm

1700
04:43:35,849 --> 04:43:54,540
alive i'm alive i live which one is it i live probably not for long though hey more firework

1701
04:43:54,540 --> 04:44:02,310
chests huh kind of a weird focus that i have for this run i open stuff good get away from me

1702
04:44:04,150 --> 04:44:18,279
get away from me what is that 3d glasses uh i'm on teleporters over here i wouldn't spawn any of

1703
04:44:18,279 --> 04:44:28,020
that until this big guy's dead though okay probably for the best he is dead all right i wouldn't

1704
04:44:28,020 --> 04:44:39,990
spawn that until we're ready to grow and we're probably we're an impossible all right i'm ready

1705
04:44:39,990 --> 04:44:49,110
impossible yes so it says but i don't believe it let's see if it's possible mega oh it's the

1706
04:44:49,110 --> 04:45:01,319

1708
04:45:17,290 --> 04:45:26,919

1759
04:56:58,409 --> 04:57:09,770
jesus oh man trying to freeze them all down oh we got a blue portal which apparently we don't need

1760
04:57:09,770 --> 04:57:17,419
they dead boss is dead teleporter is active um did i pick up the boss loot already

1761
04:57:18,520 --> 04:57:22,119
uh what was the achievement we just got there's another boss loot here

1762
04:57:27,590 --> 04:57:36,970
uh i didn't pick one up yet i don't think yeah i picked up chrono bobble too i don't know what

1763
04:57:36,970 --> 04:57:43,369
that is so do we have enough to unlock this guy there's a coin where's this coin all right you

1764
04:57:43,369 --> 04:57:55,509
got five you get five coins right uh i have five coins so you also have five coins yes cool oops

1765
04:57:57,479 --> 04:58:03,959
all right i don't think there's any more chests here to be honest no we've i kind of went around

1766
04:58:03,959 --> 04:58:13,830
the whole map i have like 10 000 gold yeah you need you each need 10 oh yeah okay there's some

1767
04:58:13,830 --> 04:58:25,139
boxes back here no let's see if i can find any all right we're gonna look we're gonna check it out

1768
04:58:31,220 --> 04:58:41,880
i don't see anything all right could try it what is it something good cube uh i like the missiles

1769
04:58:42,439 --> 04:59:10,439
i sound like a bunch of horses i don't see anything else i think we're good to leave

1770
04:59:13,000 --> 04:59:20,409
there is a way you can end a run after a loop interesting you can leave whenever okay well

1771
04:59:20,409 --> 04:59:27,590
we're gonna get some levels though you should go on the portal or should we just leave uh probably

1772
04:59:27,590 --> 04:59:36,520
just leave okay just go yeah your move speed seems to make your uh teleporter like your dash

1773
04:59:36,520 --> 04:59:41,560
go much further portal is if you have 10 times move speed then you've got to be teleporting like

1774
04:59:41,560 --> 04:59:45,319
crazy i think we just fucked ourselves i think we have we were supposed to go on the portal

1775
04:59:45,319 --> 04:59:50,439
for like the win condition why i think we can like win like end the run or something when

1776
04:59:51,639 --> 04:59:56,200
not i thought that was the shop we went there last time and we did it as a waste of time

1777
04:59:56,200 --> 05:00:01,639
yeah wait why is everybody freaking out last time everyone said don't go there

1778
05:00:02,279 --> 05:00:08,939
all right i'm just gonna find the portal i'll just be i'll be portal finder okay or uh i mean

1779
05:00:09,500 --> 05:00:25,110
the finder of is a now there's a boss over there fire a nice power it is here it is currently

1780
05:00:25,110 --> 05:00:31,270
being guarded by it's a giant jellyfish over here i actually have decent attack speed no

1781
05:00:31,270 --> 05:00:53,299
giant jellyfish huh there is a big jellyfish this way hello i'm gonna get some items that's

1782
05:00:53,380 --> 05:01:04,380
the slug all chests are like 531 very very expensive do like one more chest and then open the

1783
05:01:05,500 --> 05:01:12,040
pandora's box i'll help you with the jelly jellyfish more equipment

1784
05:01:35,610 --> 05:01:45,380
fire yep the burning ticking damage is like the worst defender out of everybody i think

1785
05:01:47,099 --> 05:01:53,740
yeah the fire fire damage seems to be super super like over tuned yeah you can just die like in a

1786
05:01:53,740 --> 05:02:06,060
second if you hit by far oh oh oh are we good i think i think i missed it because i was in the

1787
05:02:06,060 --> 05:02:23,639
air i got caught out this is not even the boss no oh my god did i want to whoa whoa wow oh yeah

1788
05:02:23,639 --> 05:02:35,509
sorry fire hit me oh you're dead i'm about to be dead i think i got hit by like two fire blasts and

1789
05:02:35,509 --> 05:02:48,220
it was just doing it yeah that fire damage is a ton at least it got to be fast that was fun

1790
05:02:48,220 --> 05:03:03,209
so they run around like that again is this a line of sight all right i guess i will try

1791
05:03:04,500 --> 05:03:06,659
good luck just say we did it

1792
05:03:12,389 --> 05:03:31,880
oh my god ah i pressed the wrong buttons yeah the beetle queen is really well poisoned but

1793
05:03:34,009 --> 05:03:39,770
you have to fight all this yeah like i can't look at all those robots they can't even move this

1794
05:03:39,770 --> 05:03:46,810
stuck okay that was that was seriously like diablo 3 level of numbers in the screen yes

1795
05:03:47,930 --> 05:03:57,240
accurate uh people are saying you have fungus run away and regenerate if you get low um okay

1796
05:03:57,240 --> 05:04:08,939
that's like like like run away like far away i don't know how accurate that is but seems pretty

1797
05:04:08,939 --> 05:04:24,069
accurate we're doing it why is italics doing so much more damage uh because i traded all of my

1798
05:04:24,069 --> 05:04:31,770
items for boots to run 100 faster and ran around in circles i'm not i'm not done yet

1799
05:04:33,419 --> 05:04:44,220
like i haven't i haven't won yet you know i got a little damage i do to this guy

1800
05:04:44,860 --> 05:04:59,500
this is like another boss that just spawned in okay i guess i fly now yeah wait okay do you

1801
05:04:59,500 --> 05:05:05,500
are you invulnerable when you touch that teleporter or does everything have to be dead around here oh

1802
05:05:05,500 --> 05:05:18,939
god oh boy if you touch the porter are you immune oh i think you can touch it and

1803
05:05:19,900 --> 05:05:33,340
run away and it'll just port you wherever you are trying to heal okay god they found me i guess

1804
05:05:33,340 --> 05:05:48,310
yeah you're not immune but you can just run the wisp is so good with this many mobs yeah that's

1805
05:05:48,310 --> 05:06:07,259
why he has like three or four of them what's the wisp the explosion thing right yeah just touch it

1806
05:06:08,060 --> 05:06:14,580
touch what touch the teleporter and run it'll just pull you out wherever you are

1807
05:06:15,220 --> 05:06:22,819
although you know you might get one shot here there you go huh there's like a small probability

1808
05:06:22,819 --> 05:06:28,659
possibility of dying and we're back yeah what and you're almost dead what's that

1809
05:06:31,880 --> 05:06:35,240
that wasn't fair you better run what the fuck was that

1810
05:06:36,439 --> 05:06:41,159
why is everyone spawned into enemies they were just sitting there waiting for us

1811
05:06:47,380 --> 05:06:52,040
all right uh we see we ain't gonna make it past this one what's that thing

1812
05:06:55,240 --> 05:07:01,770
uh there's a big ring oh what is no that's just a guy we are actually in hell now yeah we kind of

1813
05:07:01,770 --> 05:07:22,500
are well i want this box yeah now there's just bosses in the level with us naturally like from

1814
05:07:22,500 --> 05:07:38,439
the beginning what i get i already have that 700 bucks huh if we make it past this level i'm dead

1815
05:07:39,400 --> 05:08:05,349
if we make it past this level i'm dead i can't do it what the hell killed me was fire sprint faster

1816
05:08:06,680 --> 05:08:14,580
well what do i have to lose right all right burn the boss there's only gonna be like six of them

1817
05:08:14,580 --> 05:08:18,900
don't worry there's only one two three four five there's only five of them don't worry

1818
05:08:19,619 --> 05:08:40,779
not to mention the one that was already there okay well hold on a minute how are you as fast

1819
05:08:40,779 --> 05:08:46,580
as i was because i have three of the boots and i have sprints faster there's a goes faster and

1820
05:08:46,580 --> 05:08:52,740
the sprints faster so ten goat hooks is not as is the same speed as three goat hooks and sprint

1821
05:08:52,740 --> 05:09:04,389
faster i'm not i think i still was going faster than you what is this a sonic race like am i

1822
05:09:04,389 --> 05:09:15,060
knuckles right now we haven't heard like a tails race i just don't think it was worth it you know

1823
05:09:15,700 --> 05:09:25,020
you can do it you can kill them and then we get to complete the cycle

1824
05:09:29,909 --> 05:09:38,810
give it everything you have everything's on the line oh you got tethered you got tethered

1825
05:09:39,450 --> 05:09:57,900
i'm dead no no you're back you're back he's back he's back second win gotta go fast

1826
05:10:05,369 --> 05:10:17,459
you're at like 40 percent 35 percent 30 oh my god i gotta hide

1827
05:10:18,099 --> 05:10:34,419
oh there you go there you go come on come on so if you beat this there's gonna be a portal

1828
05:10:34,419 --> 05:10:38,779
that you're gonna go through instead of the teleporter and that's gonna give us both

1829
05:10:39,740 --> 05:11:05,139
100 gold there's still one with full health 100 that's a lot you're so close to getting rid

1830
05:11:05,139 --> 05:11:11,779
of one of them and that's there it is okay that's 33 percent less annoyance all right i'm gonna go

1831
05:11:11,779 --> 05:11:25,139
back over here chill for a second they heal during the suck phase okay i see where is he

1832
05:11:25,139 --> 05:11:34,599
there it's right there i'm so glad i just fed you those two items and then i threw all mine away

1833
05:11:36,150 --> 05:11:49,319
ow oh you could just play it slow play it simple i need full health for this guy because those

1834
05:11:49,319 --> 05:11:53,880
rolling chase things if i didn't go invisible i think i would be dead yeah did he do the suck

1835
05:11:53,880 --> 05:12:09,509
phase yet watch out for the rolling bombs why is one harder than everyone else you know what

1836
05:12:09,509 --> 05:12:14,150
i mean like why is it there was five of them why was that easier than one because it's the illusions

1837
05:12:14,150 --> 05:12:19,270
it's just the one of them that's the real one you killed all the illusions he's the illusion

1838
05:12:20,150 --> 05:12:29,799
my apm is probably so high right now come on dude you like give you get the boy scout badge

1839
05:12:30,680 --> 05:12:54,419
for doing this wow he like spawned right on top of you so close oh god

1840
05:12:58,840 --> 05:13:09,689
oh 55 minutes you got it 55 minutes oh my god 55 minutes all we need we're gonna see the cycle

1841
05:13:09,689 --> 05:13:26,840
that will be completed let's get the chant going here we go italics oh here we go here we go indeed

1842
05:13:28,650 --> 05:13:33,209
i think i got chunked for like 33 percent that was so close though you did so good

1843
05:13:33,689 --> 05:13:42,729
jingston here we go i didn't ruin it i didn't curse it there's no such thing as curses

1844
05:13:42,729 --> 05:13:55,540
it's no such thing as ghosts i got cursed oh that's all right oh damn let me see how close we are

1845
05:13:59,500 --> 05:14:09,080
he was the last guy yeah but that was fucking insanely hard like that was very difficult to do

1846
05:14:09,080 --> 05:14:21,750
all right let's see we how much all right we we seriously need to do like it was back here before

1847
05:14:22,389 --> 05:14:32,380
we'll get it here maybe next time don't ruin your build with goat feet well we have what we had to

1848
05:14:32,380 --> 05:14:44,569
see it you know what i mean i just wanted to see what it did all that work all right this is the

1849
05:14:44,569 --> 05:14:53,900
one you ready are we away from success uh we are probably like three or four levels away

1850
05:14:53,900 --> 05:15:04,310
so like one run probably one run one run from new character i think we can do it yeah well we

1851
05:15:04,310 --> 05:15:09,509
i'm gonna i'm gonna okay here we go i'm gonna try really fucking hard this time okay i'm gonna go

1852
05:15:09,509 --> 05:15:17,849
multi this time i feel like i did good with them last time i think i'm gonna go robot i had a really

1853
05:15:17,849 --> 05:15:26,439
fun build that was probably the most fun hunter's build yep there's like fast darting teleporting

1854
05:15:26,439 --> 05:15:33,939
let's give it a go this is the one oh yeah i have to invite you again my bad yeah there's gonna be

1855
05:15:33,939 --> 05:15:44,919
sweat pouring off my body i'm gonna go robot you going robot or do you want me to do double

1856
05:15:44,919 --> 05:15:50,150
robo one might not be that bad i could go commando if you want we could have one of each

1857
05:15:53,939 --> 05:16:08,060
double robo double robo double robo wait hey i don't know i'm gonna go either way on that one

1858
05:16:08,060 --> 05:16:16,840
double robo here we go now watching me like like run off the cliff like a funny thing

1859
05:16:18,439 --> 05:16:31,380
let's go oops forgot how to play all right let's just do this here we're here yeah let's go

1860
05:16:31,380 --> 05:16:48,630
challenge all right really you go okay that was dumb beating up dying on the first level

1861
05:16:51,700 --> 05:16:58,090
man the stun grenades on these groups are awesome i'm missing every shot so i'm gonna switch to

1862
05:16:58,090 --> 05:17:07,860
no miss smug no miss all right we get there's still somebody alive i feel like the ram should

1863
05:17:07,860 --> 05:17:19,779
do more damage okay uh there's still one of those enemies left he just threw is there yeah he

1864
05:17:19,779 --> 05:17:34,889
like really ran down here maybe he's dead i don't know okay boxes oh a coin oh nice up to six

1865
05:17:35,689 --> 05:17:41,369
oh you just killed him okay uh we got an activation here for the scary monster at the end

1866
05:17:42,409 --> 05:17:55,270
uh the mountain that's double loot man starting like a vanilla isaac run after being a literal

1867
05:17:55,270 --> 05:18:13,209
goddess i feel so slow it works pitiful all right well there it is oh that's better how you doing

1868
05:18:14,169 --> 05:18:23,909
good you found the uh portal yep yep right here by me well i am ready whenever you want to activate

1869
05:18:24,549 --> 05:18:38,069
all right here we go you ready yep i'm here two one activate what is it it is the

1870
05:18:39,990 --> 05:18:50,950
two of these things so is chance to stun amplified by scatter shot mode oh that's

1871
05:18:50,950 --> 05:18:57,319
like since you're shooting more bullets do you have more chance to stun or is it more damage

1872
05:18:57,319 --> 05:19:11,610
equals more chance i don't even know good question why are you doing that trying germa

1873
05:19:11,610 --> 05:19:22,869
what because i wanted the fireworks to come out and do some damage behind us careful one of those

1874
05:19:22,869 --> 05:19:39,450
robots if nail gun prox every time that would be completely op fair oh i shot you you look like a

1875
05:19:39,450 --> 05:19:59,000
bad guy oh sorry i'm screaming now okay what the fuck uh this is very bad very bad i'm gonna die

1876
05:20:00,150 --> 05:20:11,459
oh it's happening again this is a very bad position to be in how do you heal in this

1877
05:20:11,459 --> 05:20:24,229
game i'm dead oh okay i'm joining you in a brief moment well like i'm doing that you have to like

1878
05:20:24,229 --> 05:20:28,630
okay so this is like giant open area you have to like hide under a fucking log

1879
05:20:33,939 --> 05:20:46,310
well that didn't work out as planned game over game over too slow too slow it was the mountain

1880
05:20:46,310 --> 05:20:58,150
shrine that did us in may have been you want to be huntress and i'll be multi no you want me to be

1881
05:20:58,150 --> 05:21:02,630
commando i think i think double robo is not a good strat i'm willing to be commando i think we just

1882
05:21:02,630 --> 05:21:07,669
got screwed because we did the mountain thing we're both the slowest character and we had to fight

1883
05:21:07,669 --> 05:21:28,229
two of the please stand behind a rock or you'd instantly die he's the slowest character first

1884
05:21:28,229 --> 05:21:34,229
level death but we did do challenge mode so it was two level ones he moves the same p

1885
05:21:35,369 --> 05:21:49,290
he's stampede he's bigger though yeah see i'm sprinting and you're sprinting we're going the

1886
05:21:49,290 --> 05:22:04,229
same to going to same people on st pete oh all right hey thanks for the coin hidden free money

1887
05:22:04,229 --> 05:22:18,419
there's a hurt yourself up there is there for fun sure why not remember what these do oh that's a

1888
05:22:18,419 --> 05:22:36,060
75 percent you touched it i did yes everything's fine i'm all right accurate oh god damn it i did

1889
05:22:36,060 --> 05:22:51,000
shortstop it that is true all right now i need to heal damage while sprinting i was saving up for

1890
05:22:51,000 --> 05:23:01,819
that one let's figure out anything down go for the active what's in the active nice crit strike

1891
05:23:02,619 --> 05:23:11,299
there's another active right here yeah there's two anymore boxes which i don't need i marked a

1892
05:23:11,299 --> 05:23:19,860
crit for you there's a heal right here though i want the heal bot all right i guess we can go

1893
05:23:19,860 --> 05:23:27,770
ahead and fight and then search afterward something like that is there any more down this hallway

1894
05:23:30,150 --> 05:23:42,709
this is 34 right yeah heal fruit uh we should probably activate how you doing over there

1895
05:23:43,349 --> 05:24:05,340
coming back heading back start whenever let's go my accuracy is terrible what are we gonna get here

1896
05:24:06,139 --> 05:24:28,310
queen the ant friend queen bug oh that's a lot of you here oh god where the hell did you come from

1897
05:24:39,270 --> 05:24:55,450
damn down to half there's a lot of fire bugs a lot of fire i'm gonna die i'm gonna die it's been fun

1898
05:24:57,000 --> 05:25:00,439
damn this is going to be two in a row versus getting destroyed on the first level

1899
05:25:05,540 --> 05:25:20,840
jesus there's so many what the fuck why are they this many out of my way all right i'm back in the

1900

1903
05:26:34,279 --> 05:26:50,970
i just like it extra challenging um let's see are there any of the boxes i don't think there's

1904
05:26:50,970 --> 05:27:07,029
any more boxes he tried to run a shopping cart up the stairs yeah but like come on he's got legs

up top is there one up there i got uh two up this little tunnel all right we gotta get out of this

1906
05:27:20,229 --> 05:27:25,509
yeah hey we're doing pretty good we're just now getting to the second half of easy but yeah i'm

1907
05:27:25,509 --> 05:27:40,139
ready uh somebody said also well teleporter is charging the chests are red and they're easier

1908
05:27:40,139 --> 05:27:46,229
to see that's true that's good point they're red but we can't open them yet but we can see them

1909
05:27:47,349 --> 05:27:49,509
we can see them they're much easier to see on the map

1910
05:27:58,259 --> 05:28:11,299
hmm hurt yourself money machine yeah who wants to go first you can go first

1911
05:28:12,889 --> 05:28:26,299
sure there's almost no reason not to use those not really especially if you have

1912
05:28:26,299 --> 05:28:35,509
any way to heal yourself and we got chests i'm gonna go for the gamble here we go it worked out

1913
05:28:35,509 --> 05:28:39,590
no it didn't because i don't want a cube you can get two bonus items do you have an active

1914
05:28:40,549 --> 05:28:47,509
yes is it a cube i have the crit would you like it to be a cube no i'm happy with the crit

keel down and i don't know if i quite a lot of uh stuff this way i'll claim as much as i can but

1923
05:30:26,380 --> 05:30:38,419

i have so much money teleporting friend is stuck in a wall all right there's some over here

1927
05:31:46,169 --> 05:31:55,340
hate these little fire guys we got worth no money just small annoying missile thing

1928
05:31:59,319 --> 05:32:09,270
uh i have like i think i have two or three of these now two huh what is this is this is this a

1929
05:32:09,270 --> 05:32:17,029
bleed build you have bleed i'm tempted there's a lead printer here i'm tempted by it slow enemies

1930
05:32:18,150 --> 05:32:32,759
have to be sprinting while that happens though bleed is bad why don't you tell the developers

1931
05:32:32,759 --> 05:32:40,759
or make their second game maybe they won't make the same mistake twice a lot of enemies over here

1932
05:32:40,759 --> 05:32:51,779
too i can take care of that like are they copying all the stats one to one like all the damage

1933
05:32:51,779 --> 05:33:02,119
numbers too i don't know good question but if i just get 10 bleed items and i bleed every hit

1934
05:33:02,840 --> 05:33:11,619
i think it's by that's percentage based or something somebody was saying i got all this

1935
05:33:11,619 --> 05:33:18,659
money and nothing to spend it on so are you ready to uh uh i have i'm i'm almost ready to do whatever

1936
05:33:18,659 --> 05:33:21,939
you'd like to do which is start because we're already like all the way up to medium

1937
05:33:21,939 --> 05:33:33,990
yeah we are like almost a heart this is true oh this is okay we're it's this thing yeah it's

1938
05:33:34,630 --> 05:33:55,020
that thing it is this thing goodbye just get like just suck them all up coming around to help

1939
05:33:55,659 --> 05:34:07,380
i'm almost dead though that you with the vortex that was me with the vortex

1940
05:34:15,849 --> 05:34:21,939
nope double jump is really good against these guys you just jump right when they shoot and

1941
05:34:21,939 --> 05:34:41,720
they can't hit you all right one's dead two are dead ouch god damn it fire guy fire fire fire

1942
05:34:41,720 --> 05:35:12,389
no no no fire bad fire very bad my god almost there jesus good all right bosses are dead

1943
05:35:12,389 --> 05:35:28,630
boss is dead now just the babies fuel cell an additional charge not too bad

1944
05:35:29,189 --> 05:35:37,130
it's good that's what the boss relic is next to you very cool what cost 67 dollars over here

1945
05:35:37,849 --> 05:35:49,689
why does the teleporter cost 67 bucks because they decided to start taxing it um they realized free

1946
05:35:49,689 --> 05:35:54,810
teleporters were bad for business and this way if you pay for your teleporter they can make more

1947
05:35:54,810 --> 05:36:07,560
teleporters in the future i don't think there's any more i have 800 dollars so do why but you can

1948
05:36:07,560 --> 05:36:19,500
take a quick look we're already almost at hard nothing that way i don't think yeah this was

1949
05:36:19,500 --> 05:36:40,119
pretty dry for boxes well all right whenever whenever uh it was an item okay you got the will

1950
05:36:40,119 --> 05:36:47,939
of the wisp yeah it was it was a box underneath hidden under the teleporter it was okay it was

1951
05:36:47,939 --> 05:36:56,419
like stacked on top of each other hey we've done it we've done it we did it we've unlocked the

1952
05:36:56,419 --> 05:37:42,409
engineer oh cool okay new character okay money money money money hypnospace what do you mean

1953
05:37:43,380 --> 05:38:05,959
hypnospace the engineer apparently is insane i guess uh oh do you see what i see what i see

1954
05:38:05,959 --> 05:38:14,700
unlimited crit run do you yeah is it possible for unlimited crit run is it worth doing it

1955
05:38:14,700 --> 05:38:22,419
should we take is it worth it this is if you want to ditch literally everything i mean maybe i don't

1956
05:38:22,419 --> 05:38:26,259
know i don't think i even have 10 items yeah i was gonna say i don't feel like i have 10

1957
05:38:27,139 --> 05:38:42,220
i might give up a couple yeah i'll do it like three or four times what did i give up i didn't

1958
05:38:42,220 --> 05:38:50,950
even see let's see what am i gonna give up here ow um i don't think the machine works

1959
05:38:54,889 --> 05:38:59,689
i think the machine's broken the machine is broken i don't do i not have any items

1960
05:39:00,409 --> 05:39:07,610
i don't think i have any items i can put in here what i apparently all your items do you have any

1961
05:39:07,610 --> 05:39:15,029
i don't have any white items somehow okay this is gonna be bad so group them up yeah we're like

1962
05:39:15,029 --> 05:39:23,830
really weak right now for some reason i got two glasses i'll go for like 30 seems good

1963
05:39:24,549 --> 05:39:41,700
have fun with it i hope you love it all right i need to get a box 40 is reasonable that's a lot

1964
05:39:41,700 --> 05:39:51,560
of games is the teleporter berserkers pauldron enter a frenzy after killing three enemies in

1965
05:39:51,560 --> 05:39:58,900
succession okay do we want to go ahead and pump this or we're already in very hard so we may as

1966
05:39:58,900 --> 05:40:11,509
well explore which one i would probably save that bad option there's not been a good loot

1967
05:40:12,150 --> 05:40:28,599
box rng run oh they're all here i think yeah we need to have more stuff they're not yeah i did

1968
05:40:33,529 --> 05:40:47,740
yes i'm gonna go get more crit i'm go this way what i have any other boxes i think this one in

1969
05:40:47,740 --> 05:41:00,470
here i didn't pick up the item all the stuff finally something over here okay time for more

1970
05:41:00,470 --> 05:41:12,549
crit and then we can start triple jump now uh it's being a crit you want to buy a crit 133 bucks

1971
05:41:12,549 --> 05:41:22,709
there's another there's one over here you can buy you want to buy that you can eat how much money

1977
05:42:21,799 --> 05:42:41,500
else up there too i don't know what it was now uh magma worm oh even sure it was easy

1978
05:42:42,139 --> 05:43:08,229
so stacking my crits on my crits probably doesn't do very much suck them all in still 80 percent

1979
05:43:08,229 --> 05:43:41,639
crits is pretty solid didn't mean to press that button but i did the key is kind of just always

1980
05:43:42,599 --> 05:43:53,939
because he just kind of idly chases you a lot of money holy shit that's so many things up there

1981
05:43:53,939 --> 05:44:05,750
that's bad oh my god there's so many of them holy shit oh god it was all going so well until it

1982
05:44:05,750 --> 05:44:28,229
wasn't all right we should be fine oh no sunglasses rip i didn't mean to push e where did they go

1983
05:44:31,270 --> 05:44:35,909
i died that was uh that was real i've kind of told i kind of killed myself

1984
05:44:35,909 --> 05:44:43,080
with fall damage i may have fallen to my death as is want to happen the good news is

1985
05:44:43,880 --> 05:44:49,639
you're almost got it i do and you need more items than i do anyway so you can just have both

1986
05:44:49,639 --> 05:44:58,330
he's dead he has been killed two guitars ukulele one guitar two guitar we don't have enough to do

1987
05:44:58,330 --> 05:45:07,979
the portal right i don't think so no so you're free to go whenever you want uh well we probably

1988
05:45:07,979 --> 05:45:15,779
should just go portal portal portal portal everyone's screaming portal portal use portal

1989
05:45:16,419 --> 05:45:31,139
get in the portal might as well check out portal okay we're going into apparently going in the

1990
05:45:31,139 --> 05:45:43,639
portal the bizarre between time i just fucking fell off might be able to convert some items

1991
05:45:43,639 --> 05:45:49,720
for something good should we try this like item conversion i don't even know how this works

1992
05:45:49,720 --> 05:45:55,159
yeah i don't understand how it works either that's the buckler and i don't know what that item is

1993
05:45:55,159 --> 05:46:00,520
10 lunar alien head all right chat wrote alien head in all caps so i'm just gonna push e

1994
05:46:02,490 --> 05:46:09,860
wait what'd you get how do you do it i think i think you're doing it are you doing it i think

1995
05:46:09,860 --> 05:46:18,790
you just did it twice i don't think i'm doing it you have to have five green items i only have

1996
05:46:19,349 --> 05:46:28,599
oh two three i have three green items i see so how is it white items for the green one then i guess

1997
05:46:28,599 --> 05:46:34,970
oh i see it's sort of green text so germa should do it germa do it don't do it okay

1998
05:46:35,849 --> 05:46:39,770
germa get up there do it do it don't do it don't do it don't do it do it you should do it

1999
05:46:39,770 --> 05:46:50,819
it's not worth it it is worth it duality all right you ready you're gonna jump in the pool

2000
05:46:50,819 --> 05:46:58,680
it's scary well good thing we went here but i guess it's better to look except it's not

2001
05:46:58,680 --> 05:47:04,919
because now we're gonna be an impossible difficulty don't do it it's op but do not do it

2002
05:47:06,569 --> 05:47:13,639
whatever just kill the lizard it reduces cooldowns but you don't rely on cooldowns okay

2003
05:47:14,279 --> 05:47:27,639
look at this bad spawn bad spawn unbelievable that doesn't interrupt them i feel like it should

2004
05:47:29,240 --> 05:47:40,970
why did you spawn right here this is insane mode so you have to be apparently crazy and

2005
05:47:40,970 --> 05:47:54,979
unexpected i love these green mushrooms growing from my shoulders so bouncy so there's a i don't

2006
05:47:54,979 --> 05:47:59,860
know if you want to do this is a party i don't know what a party party shrine i want to go to

2007
05:47:59,860 --> 05:48:11,450
a party combat shrine probably should we do it uh yeah combat shrine might as well what is it

2008
05:48:13,430 --> 05:48:37,419
bad guy five clock bell friends what i didn't hit that even i feel so weak even with 70 70

2013
05:49:51,209 --> 05:49:57,700

of 3,700 bucks i have two of them you have two daggers right now that's what i'm saying i picked

2020
05:50:53,909 --> 05:50:59,979
it up like a random buck those daggers are gonna murder people all right let's find the thing let

2021
05:50:59,979 --> 05:51:11,700
me see if i can just kill the boss this is gonna be nightmare it's right here these belt things

2022
05:51:11,700 --> 05:51:30,310

2024
05:52:28,540 --> 05:52:51,060
fuck trying to jump up here and he's having to keep spawning the things underneath me

2025
05:52:51,700 --> 05:53:23,529
all right here we go let's see if i can get some daggers here and oh no fucking way i got

2026
05:53:23,529 --> 05:53:38,759
melted good try well let's try the uh engineer the new character yeah see what it is the engineer

2027
05:53:38,759 --> 05:53:45,770
bouncing nades mines bubble shield auto turrets oh baby so it's gonna be

2028
05:53:47,099 --> 05:54:05,509
10 characters i guess six in the game now looks like it eight grenades three thousands of mines

2029
05:54:06,229 --> 05:54:24,650
so you can put down a bubble shield that's weird he's very boring but he's op very boring huh i

2030
05:54:24,650 --> 05:54:33,180
don't know if he's apparently i've ever said that about a person who places turrets everybody likes

2031
05:54:33,180 --> 05:54:42,099
placing turrets right well i want to see it well we got to try it out mine eight bounce nades

2032
05:54:42,979 --> 05:54:56,810
super mine there's so much to look at let's see oh this is cool what eight okay

2033
05:54:57,450 --> 05:55:06,779
okay so right click mine now can i activate these no okay they have to recharge very slowly as well

2034
05:55:07,500 --> 05:55:14,200
so then what is this one what is that that's a shield oh nice bubble shield now we're playing

2035
05:55:14,200 --> 05:55:21,720
edf apparently and then what's the cooldown on the other one on turret so we can shoot out but they

2036
05:55:21,720 --> 05:55:32,040
can't shoot in the best kind of shield uh hold left click down to shoot this seems like this

2037
05:55:32,040 --> 05:55:41,049
game just got 45 easier did it with i mean you can put two turrets down that seems fucking amazing

2038
05:55:42,009 --> 05:55:50,790
we had five community subs from rin the cutest thank you rin wow i'm liking you one shot enemies

2039
05:55:50,790 --> 05:55:55,830
with left click i guess you can do that as the um thank you so much for the subs multi as well

2040
05:55:55,830 --> 05:56:07,720
five bring them in thank you and you can just kind of spam this around huh seems like it

2041
05:56:08,520 --> 05:56:16,759
okay have you seen any boxes yet uh that's the drawback engineer 45 less boxes no loot

2042
05:56:18,599 --> 05:56:24,729
only lucky shrines in play can you throw them okay you can you can kind of toss them a little bit

2043
05:56:31,430 --> 05:56:38,709
nice all right well don't forget to put down your teleporter and dispenser

2044
05:56:39,189 --> 05:56:53,689
will do and also sell my unusual for real money is there one box on the whole level

2045
05:56:55,000 --> 05:56:59,080
uh there have been zero boxes i'm in favor of just restarting let's just redo it

2046
05:56:59,080 --> 05:57:17,740
i go to hell let's do it again because that was dumb though we also were playing around with the

2047
05:57:17,740 --> 05:57:26,119
move set yeah but like i didn't open well i didn't see one box you can attach mines to germa hey check

2048
05:57:26,119 --> 05:57:33,979
your steam man turrets also get the effects of your items that sounds insane hold on stand still

2049
05:57:33,979 --> 05:57:43,049
how much damage does the shield mitigate oh you all right go all right i'm gonna go

2050
05:57:44,250 --> 05:57:52,220
i'm going for it wait let me do that to you here oh yeah hitting airborne enemies is miserable

2051
05:57:53,500 --> 05:58:02,569
all right we're supposed to restart dude no don't oh my god let me die oh it bounces my own bubbles

2052
05:58:02,569 --> 05:58:22,220
what about from in not from inside give me some stuff active what is it slug flight

2053
05:58:22,220 --> 05:58:37,560
i feel like that would be okay i miss my movement ability i just do hover guy at least i never get

2054
05:58:37,560 --> 05:58:46,700
my feet wet flying mines why would you put it just carpet like drop all right what the

2055
05:58:46,700 --> 05:58:59,099
fuck is hitting me stupid elite oh fuck off those things are so good come on right into my mind

2056
05:58:59,900 --> 05:59:05,770
come on can you stick a mind to yourself oh no that's what's going on your minds are blowing up

2057
05:59:06,409 --> 05:59:09,700
it's because you're throwing up more okay that was just freaking me out i was like why what's

2058
05:59:09,700 --> 05:59:13,779
going on to me what's happening my character yeah i guess you can only have like 10 at a time

2059
05:59:15,099 --> 05:59:31,259
uh period i found the portal so they activate pretty quickly so question the things like bleed

2060
05:59:31,259 --> 05:59:39,740
and such stack with your turret uh area items stack with your turrets apparently mushroom is

2061
05:59:39,819 --> 05:59:50,099
super good i don't know which one of these to pick yes they do so i don't have a move i can

2062
05:59:50,099 --> 06:00:02,740
stop from her getting hurt from falling uh good question i don't think you do the turrets can

2063
06:00:02,740 --> 06:00:08,299
proc bleed sticky bomb everything fungus is overpowered on turrets because they just heal

2064
06:00:08,299 --> 06:00:15,659
infinitely that's kind of cool so as fungus what is the slug is that fungus engineer does not have

2065
06:00:15,659 --> 06:00:29,669
any mobility movements okay good to know sluggish heal out of combat okay okay let me look for chests

2066
06:00:30,389 --> 06:00:40,569
yeah i can fly with this i can't just forget i have it how much was this one this class seems fun

2067
06:00:43,740 --> 06:00:51,909
everybody who's saying it's boring well that's probably used to just a hater i can see that

2068
06:00:51,909 --> 06:00:56,569
though because you really only have one move you can really even do you can like i feel like i

2069
06:00:56,569 --> 06:01:03,540
only have one move with multi this card it's kind of hard to hit this too

2070
06:01:04,259 --> 06:01:24,500
if it's a boss probably uh you want to get it started what are you fighting over here i just

2071
06:01:24,500 --> 06:01:34,950
like shooting the like burst of uh of little bombs and let's activate this thing engineer is the boss

2072
06:01:34,950 --> 06:01:57,529
killer oh gold per bullet the crowd funder gotta get more money i'll try this there's a gun on my

2073
06:01:57,529 --> 06:02:13,049
gun probably that didn't work sword do it again and shields do you have an active i do i have

2074
06:02:13,049 --> 06:02:22,569
the money gun uh we gotta get this rolling all right we gotta go we gotta go we do have to go

2075
06:02:32,919 --> 06:02:36,840
where i think i found it already what the hell was it yeah it's it's like right over here i think

2076
06:02:37,639 --> 06:02:46,360
at least i thought i did so right i'm just gonna stop at the luck shrine or some quick gambling

2077
06:02:56,569 --> 06:03:04,330
anything else no all right i'm ready let's go preemptively put down turrets

2078
06:03:05,209 --> 06:03:09,779
how long do the turrets last for though i don't know wait how many can you put down two two

2079
06:03:10,580 --> 06:03:23,139
oh you missed your turrets but don't worry i got them you can stick it to people too oh that's cool

2080
06:03:25,700 --> 06:03:34,389
all right what does the money gun do oh ow ow it's shooting all my bullets all my money

2081
06:03:35,029 --> 06:03:52,169
okay where's the other guy hey repair your torch where's the other wasps isn't there where's the

2082
06:03:52,169 --> 06:04:07,450

06:04:08,169 --> 06:04:14,250
i just got air shot twice shielding the bad guy why do the bad guys have a shield i'm gonna die

2084
06:04:14,970 --> 06:04:30,860
because oh my god give me a break where is this boss what i don't know but we still have to do

2085
06:04:30,860 --> 06:04:40,700

2088
06:05:13,819 --> 06:05:22,330
look for boxes i use my hover jets which i feel like is not a very good invention considering how

2089
06:05:22,330 --> 06:05:29,450
big they are and they can only get me one foot off the ground did i spend all my money with my

2090
06:05:29,450 --> 06:05:37,720
q gun i don't think i have any boxes over here this is an active how do you turn it off well

2091
06:05:37,720 --> 06:05:42,840
hey if you want a box i'm standing right next to one i think i found two boxes over here this money

2092
06:05:42,840 --> 06:05:48,889
gun is a trap i don't know if that is but it's mine the crystal yeah i don't have any money so

2093
06:05:48,889 --> 06:05:54,939
it's all yours um okay i just picked up something called the crowd funder yeah that's what it made

2094
06:05:54,939 --> 06:06:01,750

2095
06:06:01,750 --> 06:06:10,459
steals all your money so don't get it how do you turn it off once it starts using your money

2096
06:06:13,340 --> 06:06:17,180
yeah i toggle i toggle it off after the first time i used it apparently it didn't nothing that

2097
06:06:17,180 --> 06:06:24,889
didn't happen hey germa i was hoping i could be the one guy you're cute and bad in the game

2098
06:06:24,889 --> 06:06:32,709
i appreciate 50 percent of that comment all right where's this buck you talking about

2103
06:07:05,450 --> 06:07:10,409
fast as i can get it you can't turn it off i'm hitting he's just rising

2104
06:07:14,090 --> 06:07:20,729
you can't turn off the money gun no i think the money gun just always siphons money

2105
06:07:21,610 --> 06:07:25,290
i think this run is over somebody said you can turn it off i don't know what he's doing

2106
06:07:26,169 --> 06:07:39,860
what it's really easy you just push q chat see money gun sometimes it doesn't want to go off

2107
06:07:39,860 --> 06:07:58,299
though see like it glows when i shoot grab your item before i delete it thank you you left my

2108
06:07:58,299 --> 06:08:12,619

2112
06:08:56,939 --> 06:09:06,090
right here oh uh maybe spawns or anything we just try to kill it right now just kind of smoke it and

2113
06:09:06,090 --> 06:09:21,939
then be able to run around uh let me grab one item on the way to you okay i'm running all right

2114
06:09:21,939 --> 06:09:44,340
just don't push q do not push you drop it i don't think i can the queen kill it we have two shields

2115
06:09:44,340 --> 06:10:04,779
is better than one anybody that gets in here is gonna get mine well we are shredding bosses

2116
06:10:05,419 --> 06:10:15,049
well you kind of had to do that though we've run out of time all right we got boxes few boxes

2117
06:10:15,049 --> 06:10:20,599
maybe wait are you supposed to be able to charge your uh gun while sprinting that seems like

2118
06:10:21,560 --> 06:10:26,439
maybe something you're not supposed to be able to do i don't know but you total fyi you can left

2119
06:10:26,439 --> 06:10:35,830
click then sprint but the game doesn't want you to know that okay i've got a kiosk over here

2120
06:10:36,389 --> 06:10:49,990
just looking around okay see item that way this way you kind of just stand here huh we do have

2121
06:10:49,990 --> 06:10:55,930
to literally just stand here did i pick up that item what is this did you get yours already

2122
06:10:55,930 --> 06:11:09,189
yeah i got mine it's just the invisible thing again all right we're good all right there's

2123
06:11:09,189 --> 06:11:28,810
something over here why am i doing that i don't know this one attack speed that's kind of good

2124
06:11:28,810 --> 06:11:51,930
come on down there two down here beautiful slow enemies no one they really stuffed them back here

2125
06:11:51,930 --> 06:12:05,020
huh all right how you doing uh i found a couple chests nothing that's gonna make the run i see

2126
06:12:05,020 --> 06:12:16,310
one i can't even get to up there i'll get that one all right pray for me what are you gonna do

2127
06:12:16,869 --> 06:12:28,180
this three oh you can fly one liftoff uh what the hell is this don't go outside it's a lunar it

2128
06:12:28,180 --> 06:12:34,040
needs a coin needs a lunar coin all right let's get out of here that is dumb quick quick dude hurry

2129
06:12:34,040 --> 06:12:43,349
up you gotta tap as fast you can jump down this hole weirdly enough i didn't take any damage why

2130
06:12:43,909 --> 06:12:52,659
this is the slowest character in the game so far are you ready for me to press this

2131
06:12:53,299 --> 06:13:02,490
yeah so how did i not take any damage may as well have used my money gun there's a chest

2132
06:13:10,299 --> 06:13:27,000
all right find it there i feel like mines that are underpowered find it come on lag what's going

2133
06:13:27,000 --> 06:13:45,799
on with that lag some of these annoying things is hanging out here well turrets are pretty awesome

2134
06:13:47,099 --> 06:14:17,180
they really are this view oh a kiosk what do we got oh we got oh we got uh this one uh found the

2135
06:14:18,060 --> 06:14:24,090
thing we're looking for i don't teleport you know mines are good up people stand on boss fights

2136
06:14:24,090 --> 06:14:27,610
because you can just slap them on there and it's pretty much as impossible to miss

2137
06:14:29,049 --> 06:14:45,560
true there's extra damage 266 this character is kind of fucking insane yeah it seems that way

2138
06:14:46,439 --> 06:14:52,819
uh it's right here oh nice another equipment charge for my money gun that i do not want

2139
06:15:01,130 --> 06:15:18,490
sticky bombs all right how you doing uh started hanging out looking at the meter about to switch

2140
06:15:18,490 --> 06:15:34,779
to very hard in a moment yeah that's what i was thinking attack speed again cool i feel like the

2141
06:15:34,779 --> 06:15:39,959
teleporter is always in that same spot on this level it's always like kind of back here isn't it

2142
06:15:44,580 --> 06:15:58,099
you ready yeah i think i'm already come to me one second it's 260 i'm pretty much here all right

2143
06:15:58,099 --> 06:16:03,779
you want to you got what do you cooldowns look like uh everything is refreshed and ready to go

2144
06:16:03,779 --> 06:16:25,610
all right here we go it is the imp overlord where are you there you are turrets are getting

2145
06:16:25,610 --> 06:16:37,979
beasted on now yes they are fly away maybe not let me just stay in here there's a fucking cow

2146
06:16:37,979 --> 06:16:45,959
in here with me all right i gotta get the fuck out of there well we're doing a lot of uh oh

2147
06:16:46,680 --> 06:16:53,419
she's not happy oh man i'm dead she's not happy with my turret spot god damn it just couldn't

2148
06:16:53,419 --> 06:17:11,770
really get out of it yeah he teleported on top of me oh dear yeah he that's what he did to me

2149
06:17:25,240 --> 06:17:37,639
money gun money money money money nothing bad can happen in here right oh boy you're in trouble

2150
06:17:38,360 --> 06:17:48,779
turtle inside the crate the classic strategy well i spent all my money but you know what

2151
06:17:49,419 --> 06:17:53,259
i forgot that it happens when i left click money gun is the worst on this because you have to charge

2152
06:17:53,259 --> 06:18:41,299
up hide this is surprisingly functional and i got some money back super jump

2153
06:18:45,659 --> 06:18:55,849
okay all right you've had your fun i just need this one chest risk of turtling

2154
06:18:56,569 --> 06:19:04,490
sometimes hey you gotta do what you gotta do i am playing we are playing the engineer

2155
06:19:04,490 --> 06:19:24,259
yeah it's not like we're playing um the gunslinger oh sorry all right let's get out of here slowly

2156
06:19:24,259 --> 06:19:33,319
this is level three this is uh i think so so advancing before insane i think is pretty decent

2157
06:19:35,049 --> 06:19:48,220
fairly lukewarm fairly lukewarm fairly like lukewarm into average somebody said read this

2158
06:19:48,220 --> 06:19:56,810
comment you got it no no i did and there's a super chest here no i did there's a there's a

2159
06:19:56,810 --> 06:20:03,990
super chest 3300 bucks keep in mind all right it wasn't worth the last time it didn't seem like it

2160
06:20:05,959 --> 06:20:16,279
would it be worth it this time hey new active i'm just gonna stand here until i get 200 bucks to

2161
06:20:16,279 --> 06:20:31,849
switch it over which may never happen do i need how much uh the that that first chest has fungus

2162
06:20:32,650 --> 06:20:36,729
and apparently we can just have infinite fungus and have our turrets never die

2163
06:20:38,069 --> 06:20:43,590
that is what i have heard that is currently what chat just simply can't stop talking about it

2164
06:20:43,590 --> 06:20:49,349
so so excited so fungus you will you want me to 3d print all my stuff how much fungus should i get

2165
06:20:50,310 --> 06:21:05,909
i'll take the fungus i'll take the fungus i'll take the fungus all right who the

2166
06:21:05,909 --> 06:21:20,020
fuck is doing this to me let me alone exclamation fungus get like five you done

2167
06:21:20,740 --> 06:21:26,650
uh i'm getting like i'm getting like how much do i have five i'll get i'll get seven i'm waiting

2168
06:21:26,650 --> 06:21:36,139
for my turn at the fungus uh machine all right i'm done are you sure have fun stay away from my

2169
06:21:36,139 --> 06:21:42,119
fungus no no what do you know yeah i thought you guys didn't everyone just say get like between five

2170
06:21:42,119 --> 06:21:48,919
to ten you mean like five too much back up did i pick it up did i take yours no this is my fungus

2171
06:21:48,919 --> 06:21:57,990
all right have fun with your fungus seven is not too much okay well just get a fruit we gotta do

2172
06:21:57,990 --> 06:22:07,779
the meme build i mean we just have to stand in one spot and have our turrets do everything it's a

2173
06:22:07,779 --> 06:22:12,419
self-fulfilling prophecy everyone's like this is the most boring clash it's because when i find the

2174
06:22:12,419 --> 06:22:20,779
fungus machine oh my god okay everything for ultimate fungus build that's a huge huge area

2175
06:22:21,500 --> 06:22:27,990
and if we have four of these and we can stand still all right i have nine fungus you have nine

2176
06:22:27,990 --> 06:22:33,849
i got seven so if we stack our turrets one on top of the other okay um what the fuck is killing me

2177
06:22:33,849 --> 06:22:40,709
right now did you pick this up what is this what what is what is going on with the fire damage in

2178
06:22:40,709 --> 06:22:45,590
this game i don't know it's kind of crazy just put down a turret all right let's go find the thing

2179
06:22:46,389 --> 06:22:50,549
and then just stand on top of our turrets just stand let's create an aura of healing turrets

2180
06:22:51,189 --> 06:23:20,200
it's over here where it's over there oh what happens if you go all the way up here

2181
06:23:21,349 --> 06:23:32,020
oh how do you get down it's a good question what's in here okay we've got if i jump from

2182
06:23:32,020 --> 06:23:41,849
this height am i going to be dead be careful this seems dangerous i don't i can't i don't

2183
06:23:41,849 --> 06:23:46,490
know what's happening but this seems really really really powerful i think we found the

2184
06:23:46,490 --> 06:23:52,250
build that we're both going to have to uh beat the game with all right where's that mask

2185
06:23:54,139 --> 06:24:03,180
wow the aoe is gigantic after killing three where's the uh teleport going to a friend

2186
06:24:03,900 --> 06:24:13,740
teleport is very fine oh let's activate it all right let's ready put down your shit make sure

2187
06:24:13,740 --> 06:24:17,020
we make sure you put them in the same spot so we can all get like we can stack on us

2188
06:24:17,020 --> 06:24:25,240
it's the magma worm dude this is i am i playing overwatch that's what i feel like i feel like

2189
06:24:25,240 --> 06:24:31,900
this is eight you are now so who said we'd be unkillable because one of my friends is already

2190
06:24:31,900 --> 06:24:44,409
dead you liars stand well you have to stand still too right do i stand still i think i'm invincible

2191
06:24:44,409 --> 06:24:48,729
i think we all stand still oh my god okay no no wait wait that's probably not a good idea is it

2192
06:24:48,729 --> 06:24:57,319
a good idea we should stand still stand still right next to each other um i don't know if i

2193
06:24:57,319 --> 06:25:08,500
like this it feels a little terrifying yeah i'm taking a lot of damage uh yeah oh my god we didn't

2194
06:25:08,500 --> 06:25:12,659
plan this we didn't plan this good enough we had we should have stuck on top of each other okay

2195
06:25:13,380 --> 06:25:29,380
i'm here here's a shield i'm gonna stand still now here's my turret okay good yeah magma worm

2196
06:25:29,380 --> 06:25:36,740
probably is not what was intended this is overwatch with mods this is just remember when

2197
06:25:36,740 --> 06:25:43,060
they used to do the arcade mode yeah well that sucks oh you've got to be kidding me

2198
06:25:43,060 --> 06:25:52,279
what just fucking happened right there i'm flying you are you serious right now what was i got

2199
06:25:52,279 --> 06:26:00,119
another turd in we have four turrets now i hope that they can do good deep so why is fire damage

2200
06:26:00,119 --> 06:26:07,659
like times 500 times damage you're dead no i'm almost dead i'm coming back into the heels the

2201
06:26:07,659 --> 06:26:21,610
delicious heels i'm healed i gotta hold still it's bug if any one of us panics and like runs away

2202
06:26:22,729 --> 06:26:27,849
it's like we're breaking the herd immunity oh the devs know it's broken oh fire is actually broken

2203
06:26:27,849 --> 06:26:32,490
like it's a broken mechanic oh like it's actually like actually like they're patching it because

2204
06:26:32,490 --> 06:26:38,360
it's broken okay well that makes sense i was gonna say what the fuck you like see look at that

2205
06:26:39,080 --> 06:26:44,709
are you dead you did yeah you just you just healed through like dying how are you dead

2206
06:26:44,709 --> 06:26:52,889
because he launched me across the whole game and i died to fire damage i didn't realize i was alone

2207
06:26:52,889 --> 06:26:57,689
in this he knocked me in the air and put a dot on me and it was doing like 200 damage a tick

2208
06:26:57,689 --> 06:27:06,900
and then i died from the fall all the turrets are getting healed too oh that was bad that was a nasty

2209
06:27:06,900 --> 06:27:16,069
one you did it did i hey i did it now where's that legendary chest uh how much money do you have

2210
06:27:17,430 --> 06:27:26,119
slow enemies on hit that's probably good uh 3043 that's not enough i think it's 37 what was the

2211
06:27:26,119 --> 06:27:32,680
required amount i think it was 37 was 34 80 all right i'm just gonna pick up like this one thing

2212
06:27:32,680 --> 06:27:47,909
and then come back you need 300 more i believe these are green feathers a jump right

2213
06:27:48,709 --> 06:28:01,369
this game's fucking bonkers always go with the random item could be anything all right

2214
06:28:01,930 --> 06:28:07,590
is that all there is for me to get uh well yeah i think so unless you want to do the challenge

2215
06:28:07,590 --> 06:28:26,139
mode right there that's okay surprisingly little to pay for over this way turrets are still having

2216
06:28:26,139 --> 06:28:35,340
a good old time so wait if i die my turrets just stay there uh yes that's strange they do indeed

2217
06:28:36,060 --> 06:28:45,180
all right well ready to fight another day so i feel like that strategy will work on every other boss

2218
06:28:45,819 --> 06:28:55,180
now if unless they can one chunk you yeah if they can hit like kill you in one that's 120 120

2219
06:28:56,220 --> 06:29:06,950
that's 120 times six so that's how much help is strong enough to actually kill things quickly

2220
06:29:06,950 --> 06:29:14,099
yeah let's uh clean up quickly did you just eat those is he eating these

2221
06:29:15,299 --> 06:29:21,220
excuse me i would like to ask a question is there a reason why he i can't hit this guy

2222
06:29:24,619 --> 06:29:38,169
what what are you eating that was weird that was strange he was just inhaling them let's go

2223
06:29:38,169 --> 06:29:49,939
over here minimum arming distance probably something like that something weird they're not killing

2224
06:29:49,939 --> 06:30:04,250
them fast enough oh i got a slug too and even more attack speed so this is back to level one

2225
06:30:04,250 --> 06:30:18,040
right i believe so the level one loop wow that hurt oh it's a fire guy wow i got super slow on

2226
06:30:18,040 --> 06:30:46,470
him let's get away from me you can only i can only do oh this is there's a boss up here it's

2227
06:30:46,470 --> 06:31:04,200
like one of those boss characters all right any sign of the uh thing uh not yet yeah that's like

2228
06:31:05,080 --> 06:31:10,840
there's four or five of those oh my i mean it's not a boss but it's one of the boss those boss

2229
06:31:10,840 --> 06:31:16,790
characters and you fight five of them at the same time right what if i turn this on and didn't even

2230
06:31:16,790 --> 06:31:22,970
tell them what are you doing i'm not going to do that this is our first like actual reel we might

2231
06:31:22,970 --> 06:31:31,209
actually beat the loop maybe i'll uh come down to you because we don't want to get to haha level

2232
06:31:31,209 --> 06:31:48,180
when we do this probably this like feels like i shouldn't be doing this but i it's just so

2233
06:31:48,180 --> 06:31:53,900
counterproductive to move it's counterproductive strange it feels so weird that's how i feel every

2234
06:31:53,900 --> 06:32:20,380
day chest nice oh any sign of it uh i don't think so oh yeah here it is ready no no way we let we

2235
06:32:20,380 --> 06:32:24,380
need to we need to like get this situated we need to be ready we have to be in the same spot i only

2236
06:32:24,380 --> 06:32:30,729
have one turret available okay here's one two i'm standing here and i have five seconds for the next

2237
06:32:31,689 --> 06:32:36,979
okay are you ready to stand still three becomes my last one here we go we have to activate this

2238
06:32:36,979 --> 06:32:52,470
before we get to ha ha ha okay so it's just this thing just stand still and spam am i hitting them

2239
06:32:52,470 --> 06:33:00,919
my own what the fuck why what was that was that his i don't know what was just happening i only had

2240
06:33:00,919 --> 06:33:10,840
one portal down now you've got a no but why was it bouncing what a what a pro strat this is oh and

2241
06:33:10,840 --> 06:33:19,849
then you fly as long as you don't fly too far here he comes he's gonna step on us now oh that

2242
06:33:19,849 --> 06:33:26,490
hurts i'm so scared i feel like i should need to move i'm on top of them one down one to go

2243
06:33:28,139 --> 06:33:33,900
we're not even in ha ha ha land yet this is fucking the rancho relax strategy

2244
06:33:36,580 --> 06:33:38,889
this really is like the meme build

2245
06:33:39,369 --> 06:33:52,009
um where is he over there where's the other actual i can't see there's too many fucking

2246
06:33:52,009 --> 06:33:56,490
rhinos too much green goo there's too many winstons on our team i don't know where we are

2247
06:34:01,130 --> 06:34:11,049
it works until it doesn't is this trap yeah that's true any where is the actual bus we got to 99

2255
06:35:28,470 --> 06:35:40,520
out boxes all right we're in ha ha ha we this is we have one more after this right i think so

2256
06:35:40,520 --> 06:35:48,200
so the ideology here is to get to the portal as fast as possible and do our impenetrable fort

2257
06:35:48,200 --> 06:35:51,799
yeah before it gets too far down the ha ha ha tree i don't i don't see any loot so i'm just

2258
06:35:51,799 --> 06:35:54,680
gonna come to the thing by the teleporter yeah let's just get the hell out of here we'll level

2259
06:35:54,680 --> 06:36:08,330
up a few times let me grab my boss gear it's right here and let's get the hell out of here

2260
06:36:10,740 --> 06:36:20,060
oh right that way i got some good max hp all right tactic go find as fast as possible

2261
06:36:20,950 --> 06:36:37,770
find the teleporter and then set up shop and let's get out of this let's do it good tactic

2262
06:36:37,770 --> 06:36:53,299
i like being up here and we can see down i don't see any particles what's hurting me what's hurting

2263
06:36:53,299 --> 06:37:05,959
me what is hurting oh did i go out of bounds you can go out of bounds in this game yes watch for

2264
06:37:05,959 --> 06:37:21,500
the red rope all the way around the edge keep gotta keep looking here so far i got nothing

2265
06:37:22,220 --> 06:37:33,639
it's over here it's being blocked by a titan no my god are you gonna be okay i don't know

2266
06:37:33,639 --> 06:37:41,990
what is that rp talk like i don't know i just don't know what's that oh um oh i think uh this

2267
06:37:41,990 --> 06:37:54,330
thing yep slug okay it's right up here all right are you ready sorry i got the correct

2268
06:37:54,330 --> 06:37:59,369
hall's goat hoof for move faster i don't know why you would need anything that useless oh god

2269
06:38:00,330 --> 06:38:08,439
we gotta get over to that thing where is it it's over here oh fuck we gotta do the strategy

2270
06:38:08,439 --> 06:38:13,720
we're useless without the strategy oh yeah definitely ready i'm on it i don't know where

2271
06:38:13,720 --> 06:38:21,000
you are come to me ping oh i got it pink okay you know where we are close yeah i'm just gonna

2272
06:38:21,000 --> 06:38:26,840
i'm starting strategy a oh god i'm like left behind in the zombie apocalypse i'm coming

2273
06:38:27,799 --> 06:38:34,200
this is oh my god i need you i'm here i need you i need your other heel all right i'm gonna stand

2274
06:38:34,200 --> 06:38:41,049
still oh jesus they've breached all right press the button one of the engineer turrets is dead

2275
06:38:43,659 --> 06:38:54,360
oh my god it's too spiky damage is too spiky hold on have faith hold i bought us some time with with

2276
06:38:54,360 --> 06:39:11,509
my uh oh it's totally dead well we did hold the line we will definitely get some kind of metal

2277
06:39:11,509 --> 06:39:25,029
for that i think god damn it why uh it works until it didn't that was so long uh what time is it

2278
06:39:26,950 --> 06:39:39,130
11 seven hours oh yeah that's so unfortunate not much else we can unlock except you'd have

2279
06:39:39,130 --> 06:39:45,750
to get the 10 points which would probably take like a few hours obliterate yourself at the obelisk

2280
06:39:45,750 --> 06:39:54,569
is that the like you beat all the things guy i think that you that's when we beat that i think

2281
06:39:54,569 --> 06:40:05,500
we go to the obelisk i don't even know what killed us what even did that much damage that was just a

2282
06:40:05,500 --> 06:40:14,979
it was like it was just an explosion yeah seven stage is the portal option for obliteration that

2283
06:40:14,979 --> 06:40:20,580
unlocks a character that's cool there's three greater wisps shooting at the same time a beetle

2284
06:40:20,580 --> 06:40:30,409
queen bomb oh well that was fun yeah that was fun for something in early access that just came

2285
06:40:30,409 --> 06:40:38,340
at early access randomly for just there it is uh that was good yep and there's still two more

2286
06:40:38,340 --> 06:40:46,099
characters and i guess four more to be added and i'm going to 20 bucks fairly reasonable as well

2287
06:40:46,099 --> 06:40:57,290
i would obviously we'll probably see much more content yeah added in the coming months yeah it's

2288
06:40:57,290 --> 06:41:02,810
good stuff no that was cool it's really smooth the only complaint really i had was the like the fire

2289
06:41:02,810 --> 06:41:08,970
damage but that's apparently a bug so yeah the uh it's just really addictive getting like a super

2290
06:41:08,970 --> 06:41:25,419
build yeah that's fun and the co-op seems smooth i think we can disband the squad what happens if i

2291
06:41:25,419 --> 06:41:33,290
do this i'm still in the squad oh you're still in the squad you're never going to leave the squad

2292
06:41:33,290 --> 06:41:42,939

06:44:26,549 --> 06:44:46,860
now the charity is going to be the nevada humane society very highly rated charity and regardless

2312
06:44:46,860 --> 06:44:54,950
of how much money is made on that stream at least 221 dollars is going to go to the nevada humane

2313
06:44:54,950 --> 06:45:08,020
society because if i get zero dollars on these tickets that don't matter if it's 50 grand

2389
06:57:14,919 --> 06:57:23,099
you to all the subs see if you can see your name it's gonna be blown by here in a second

2390
06:57:26,259 --> 06:57:34,819
put it under dwarf fortress why would i put it in dwarf fortress don't you still need to pay

2391
06:57:34,819 --> 06:57:40,819
income tax on lotto winnings no i don't think so because i was talking about this uh with a

2392
06:57:40,819 --> 06:57:49,930
few people casino winnings are just taxed i don't think they count as income so let's okay if i

2393
06:57:49,930 --> 06:57:57,540
win a million dollars on a scratch ticket i believe a portion of that like 20 to 30 percent of that

2394
06:57:57,540 --> 06:58:10,520
is just taxed i don't think it counts as income on my like tax return is a lottery ticket income

2395
06:58:16,729 --> 06:58:25,080
are gambling winnings income gambling winnings are fully taxable and you must report the income

2396
06:58:25,080 --> 06:58:29,560
on your tax return gambling income includes but is not limited to winning some lotteries raffles

2397
06:58:29,560 --> 06:58:38,229
casinos includes cash winnings income is it how do gambling winnings affect if your winnings

2398
06:58:38,229 --> 06:58:43,990
are reported on a form w2g federal taxes are withheld at a flat rate of 25 percent

2399
06:58:44,709 --> 06:58:55,659
okay but does that mean we'll fucking figure it out i'm pretty certain that if i win a million

2400
06:58:55,659 --> 06:59:07,849
dollars on a ticket tomorrow 250 000 is goes to the irs and then that's just it that's i

2401
06:59:07,849 --> 06:59:18,889
believe that's correct i don't think that affects my actual like income for 2019 and then okay so

2402
06:59:18,889 --> 06:59:26,869
that's gonna be strange so okay if i take in let's say it does affect income so if i win a million

2403
06:59:26,869 --> 06:59:31,430
dollars on a scratch ticket and it affects income okay you know so you made you made a million

2404
06:59:31,430 --> 06:59:48,229
dollars in 2019 and you donated 750 000 to charity i'm gonna have to like i'm fairly certain that's

2405
06:59:48,229 --> 06:59:54,630
not how it works donations are deductible so what i had like i had 750 000 dollars in expenses in

2406
06:59:54,630 --> 07:00:09,340
2019 just mail them the ticket they'll deal with it win the money then go to h&r block on stream

2407
07:00:09,340 --> 07:00:20,340
and say what do i do by the way this is assuming that i'm going to win a million dollars on this

2408
07:00:20,340 --> 07:00:29,479
what like a gambling fallacy i'll be lucky if i win like 100 bucks tomorrow but there's a

2409
07:00:29,479 --> 07:00:34,520
possibility that i could win like 50 grand and then 50 grand that goes right to the nevada

2410
07:00:35,080 --> 07:00:49,909
humane society what if you win one dollar it gets rounded up to 221 double or nothing after

2411
07:00:49,909 --> 07:01:02,220
tomorrow's stream i know people are already going to be saying that i'm not going to do

2412
07:01:02,939 --> 07:01:06,860
a like scratching for sakiro deaths and then whatever is won for charity

2413
07:01:07,659 --> 07:01:17,450
and win nine dollars and send nine dollars i mean like it's we're doing like a whole event here for

2414
07:01:17,450 --> 07:01:24,779
this like i'm gonna do at least 200 i'm gonna give at least 221 dollars don't even worry i'm

2415
07:01:24,779 --> 07:01:34,709
look i am going i'm gonna hit like a thousand dollars tomorrow just watch i'm gonna hit like

2416
07:01:34,709 --> 07:01:45,500
