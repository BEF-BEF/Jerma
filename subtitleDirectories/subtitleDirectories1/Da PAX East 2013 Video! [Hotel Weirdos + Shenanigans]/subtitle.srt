00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:15,380
Hey, what's going on guys? It's Jerma. I want to show you something. I want to show you something.

2
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:18,379
We can't do this at the same time. This is a walk-in bath.

3
00:00:18,379 --> 00:00:22,379
Alright, so you just film. This is all I want. I just want the walk-in bath button.

4
00:00:22,379 --> 00:00:26,379
Hey, what's going on guys? It's Jerma here. We're in the hotel room right now. Orbe's behind the camera.

5
00:00:26,379 --> 00:00:29,379
Hello. I just want to show you something.

6
00:00:29,379 --> 00:00:33,380
You ever had a goddamn walk-in bath before?

7
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:36,380
This is a walk-in bath. This place is fancy.

8
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:37,380
It's fancy.

9
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:41,380
I've never stayed in a hotel where there was a walk-in bath. Ever.

10
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:43,380
Have you ever stayed in a hotel where there was a walk-in bath?

11
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:44,380
Actually, I have.

12
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:48,380
This is awesome. I feel like I'm in like heaven.

13
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:56,380
One thing that's really important about my channel, we got to show the coffee maker that's in the hotel room. Look at this, baby.

14
00:00:56,380 --> 00:01:04,379
Oh yeah. That's like single cup coffee. I don't know if this is like gross. Wait, if I touch this, is it going to charge to my account?

15
00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:08,689
Picked up in room 600.

16
00:01:08,689 --> 00:01:17,500
Look at this. This is Boston. Look at all these cars. People are going places. People are coming places. Where are these people going?

17
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:21,739
Well, that's a delivery truck, so he's delivering something, apparently.

18
00:01:21,739 --> 00:01:24,739
When you're seeing this, it'll probably be Saturday, I'm thinking, I'm assuming.

19
00:01:24,739 --> 00:01:31,739
Or if you're coming to my channel and you just like got here like yesterday and you just subscribed, this is when we were at PAX East.

20
00:01:31,739 --> 00:01:33,739
That really is true. Hold on, I got to get this.

21
00:01:33,739 --> 00:01:34,739
It's snowing badly.

22
00:01:34,739 --> 00:01:35,739
This is, all right, hold on.

23
00:01:35,739 --> 00:01:36,739
They're huge.

24
00:01:36,739 --> 00:01:41,739
All right, guys, right now it's snowing. The snowflakes are so huge, it looks like paper.

25
00:01:41,739 --> 00:01:45,739
Like, ready, look at this. It looks like pieces of paper. Can we get like a good shot of this?

26
00:01:45,739 --> 00:01:51,500
Come on, come on. Give me a good one. Give me a good one. They're like pieces of paper. Look at that. Look at that. Look at how big that is.

27
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:55,500
Do you see that? Can you believe it? I can't believe it.

28
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:03,799
What time is it right now? Saturday morning, day two, PAX.

29
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:05,799
Solo POV.

30
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:15,870
I'm stretching with my leg. I forgot I was wearing these. Look at these. I look like I'm 75 years old.

31
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:23,870
Oh, it's just grandpa. Grandpa decided to come to PAX today and I go, oh baby, that's a tough walk right there.

32
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:29,250
What the fuck?

33
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:31,250
Oh my God, star pass out from all the drinking.

34
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:34,379
I haven't been in a minute.

35
00:02:34,379 --> 00:02:36,379
We found him at Four Prostitutes.

36
00:02:36,379 --> 00:02:37,379
He's running in his dream.

37
00:02:37,379 --> 00:02:40,379
Oh wow, he's looking. Don't wake him up. He's like running.

38
00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:45,250
It looks like you don't have any arms.

39
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:48,250
Yeah, it looks like you.

40
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:50,250
You're a fish.

41
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:54,560
Oh shit.

42
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,800
Oh my God. He's going to die.

43
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:03,539
Don't forget arms shut up.

44
00:03:03,539 --> 00:03:06,539
And work in it, eh?

45
00:03:06,539 --> 00:03:08,539
Don't forget arms.

46
00:03:08,539 --> 00:03:11,030
Let me show you the time right now, guys.

47
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:15,340
Right now, it is five after ten.

48
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:18,340
Hey, I'm doing a Facebook update.

49
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:23,340
It's five after ten and Orb is still sitting here like talking to people.

50
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:27,340
So, wait, doesn't Facebook deserve an update on what's going on?

51
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:31,340
You could just do it on your telephone. Oh, that's right, you're from Schweden.

52
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:36,340
You can't like do that up here. You're from friggin' Schweden.

53
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:39,340
Don't forget our meat app.

54
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:43,340
He's also in his underwear, look.

55
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:47,340
I want to see the blizzard conference. We only got like 20 minutes.

56
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:49,340
Let's go.

57
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:52,340
Oh, real life argument on camera.

58
00:03:52,340 --> 00:04:44,589
So right now, we are en route to Dave's Bar and Grill and get smashed into like a telephone pole.

59
00:04:44,589 --> 00:04:47,589
We're going to Dave's Cheetos Bar and Grill.

60
00:04:47,589 --> 00:05:02,699
Get on my level.

61
00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:05,699
There's the other person who's recording. It's like, screw you for recording.

62
00:05:05,699 --> 00:05:06,699
It really is true.

63
00:05:06,699 --> 00:05:08,699
Let's ruin it.

64
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:12,699
We're really going. We're going to Burger Boy's having a party.

65
00:05:12,699 --> 00:05:15,699
We're actually walking down the street to his house.

66
00:05:15,699 --> 00:05:19,699
And Chicken Fingers actually said that we get free VIP beers.

67
00:05:19,699 --> 00:05:29,740
We only get one and it's like the cheapest dog shit beer you can drink.

68
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:31,740
Can you hold this?

69
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:33,740
Can you hold this?

70
00:05:33,740 --> 00:06:07,720
This is my love for dream running.

71
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,720
I'm playing copyright infringement.
