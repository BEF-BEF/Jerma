1
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:09,109
Hey, how's it going? I see that my title has changed.

2
00:00:09,109 --> 00:00:13,029
Um, it's supposed to be Breath of the Wild,

3
00:00:13,029 --> 00:00:17,429
Chill Zone, and I'm a little, a little irritated

4
00:00:17,429 --> 00:00:21,910
that it was changed without my knowledge. I'm just a little

5
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:29,079
a little irritated about that. It was lame.

6
00:00:29,079 --> 00:00:33,460
It's way funnier. Uh, no, you don't, no, you don't get it.

7
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:40,229
Nobody else is allowed to be funnier than me on my stream. Let's know how it

8
00:00:40,229 --> 00:00:50,539
works. Ego Andy. Nobody said true.

9
00:00:50,539 --> 00:00:55,780
Wow, I thought I was gonna see some trues. Okay,

10
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:59,460
uh, so let me give you a little bit of uh, what's gonna happen here today.

11
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:03,770
This is gonna be kind of a shorter stream. I

12
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:12,439
kind of feel like my head hurts and it's, I know why. I slept wrong.

13
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:15,879
I feel fine, but you know when you sleep wrong

14
00:01:15,879 --> 00:01:20,280
and you know you slept wrong and you wake up and you're like, shit,

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:25,700
I kind of, if I don't go back to bed, then it's gonna be bad. It's gonna be worse,

16
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:30,579
right? And then you go back to bed and you sleep for another hour or two and

17
00:01:30,579 --> 00:01:36,920
you wake up and you're way worse. I hate that. That's what

18
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:45,000
happened today. So, um, still gonna do the same plan

19
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,650
and maybe all the, maybe the horror game last night.

20
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:51,049
Maybe I had like a nightmare or something. I don't know. I mean, I may have had a

21
00:01:51,049 --> 00:01:56,540
nightmare. But that, whatever. But yeah, here's what

22
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:59,739
we're gonna do. We're gonna do Breath of the Wild for like an hour or two.

23
00:01:59,739 --> 00:02:04,379
And then we're gonna move to Gotham Knights uh, for the last couple of hours.

24
00:02:04,379 --> 00:02:07,500
So the stream's probably gonna be like four hours,

25
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:12,060
maybe. I got some stuff I want to do later tonight and tomorrow I've got,

26
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:19,819
uh, I want to make sure I'm alert. So this will be probably like a four hour stream.

27
00:02:19,819 --> 00:02:23,099
Uh, this will be the end of the Gotham Knights sponsored

28
00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:31,030
content. I mean they, WB has just been, has been so good to this fucking channel.

29
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:35,270
I, like, that's all I can really say. They really have been.

30
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:40,069
Um, so if, if you guys want to like thank somebody, like it would,

31
00:02:40,069 --> 00:02:43,270
WB has been one of the biggest contributors.

32
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:46,949
Uh, one of the biggest supporters of this stream in the last six plus months.

33
00:02:46,949 --> 00:02:59,620
So, um, that's uh, they've been on point. It's been great. But that's not right now.

34
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:04,469
Right now we're gonna play Breath of the Wild and then later

35
00:03:04,469 --> 00:03:08,229
in a couple of hours or so we're gonna do Breath of the Wild Gotham Knights.

36
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:13,219
I, I'm telling you I'm gonna be like chill today but I say that every time

37
00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:26,949
and it never happens. So we'll see. Take a sip of this.

38
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:34,840
Ah, every time I say I'm gonna relax today, I end up, it ends up being the most like unhinged

39
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:38,439
stream of the week. So you know what? It's gonna be an insane day today.

40
00:03:40,099 --> 00:03:43,300
It's gonna be so fucked up today. I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be loud,

41
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:46,259
I'm gonna be screaming, I'm gonna be making jokes. It's gonna be insane.

42
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:54,180
Just so you know. And here we are.

43
00:03:54,180 --> 00:04:06,500
Uh, what was the last thing that I did? I'm trying to think. Where in the map are we?

44
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:10,729
Oh, right. I upgraded gear. Oh, no, no, no. I went through that weird maze thing

45
00:04:10,729 --> 00:04:17,610
that everybody was mad at me about. Yeah, I brute forced the lost woods.

46
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:22,040
Well, I, I, excuse me, uh, you know, you think I need?

47
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:25,319
They're like, oh, I didn't know like the exact route.

48
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:31,540
No, I just put my chest out and fucking walk forward and I make it.

49
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:36,540
There's a raid? Oh, there is a raid. Oh, there is a raid.

50
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:41,129
There's like three raids. What is it? This is like a coordinated raid.

51
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,879
There's like three people raid me at the same time.

52
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:52,779
You look like a greasy today. I told, I was gonna scream, I was gonna say,

53
00:04:52,779 --> 00:04:55,829
shut up to you. But I'm supposed to be chill today.

54
00:04:55,829 --> 00:05:01,910
Uh, Jack Manifold, Slimesicle, and Oofs at the same exact time.

55
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:05,879
Just came in with like 3,000 people or something. I'm like, hi, guys.

56
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:10,500
Hey, everybody. What's up? Thanks for the raids.

57
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,060
All right, cool. Is triple raid song?

58
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:21,379
No, I'm supposed to be chilling out today. Oh.

59
00:05:21,379 --> 00:05:25,060
Now, see, that was bad too. That was bad because I didn't give my all

60
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:28,420
because I have a headache today. And this is, this is your fault for making me do that.

61
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:30,740
You told me to do that. It's your fault. That was bad.

62
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:34,410
All right, we're gonna play Breath of the Wild.

63
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:37,610
Uh, welcome, everybody. Thanks for the raids. Hope you had good streams.

64
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:44,439
And, uh, I'm sorry. I, I can't, fuck, I can't press the button to turn the camera off.

65
00:05:44,439 --> 00:05:47,399
That's like disconnected because I was trying to fix my camera from last night.

66
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:50,730
It's like glitching stuff. I still have no idea why that's happening.

67
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:57,800
All right, it's time to look over at the chat and have somebody tell me where I need to go next.

68
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:14,139
Because it's been about two weeks since I've opened the game. Just do it your way.

69
00:06:19,449 --> 00:06:39,019
Okay, I'm going to go find a shrine. I'm going to do it my way.

70
00:06:39,019 --> 00:06:49,079
Do the, do what's the Luddie? Do the Luddie?

71
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:55,259
Yes. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hit the Luddie, hit the Luddie.

72
00:06:55,259 --> 00:06:59,060
Wait, is that the, is that the Ludwig dance? Is that like the this thing?

73
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:08,810
I don't know how to do it. And I feel like I don't have like real pants on, so I can't stand up.

74
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:15,079
It's like you go whim, whim, whim. Data tutorial, ask him.

75
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:18,839
I don't have real pants on. Well, like I do, but they're like, there's a big hole in the middle.

76
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:30,069
That sounded fucked up. Um, listen, it's because the button doesn't work.

77
00:07:30,069 --> 00:07:35,660
Oh yeah, we're going to move on. I'll do the, I'll do the Luddie.

78
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:40,389
Just not now. I'll do, I'll try the Luddie. I have to study it for a little bit though.

79
00:07:40,389 --> 00:07:48,439
I'll try it next stream. Uh, I need a shrine.

80
00:07:48,439 --> 00:07:55,879
There's a tower over there. Should I just go to the tower? Why not, right?

81
00:07:55,879 --> 00:08:03,300
I'm just going to go activate that tower. Let's go. I forget what P is.

82
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:15,779
Shrine is done over there. Yeah, I'm going for that tower straight ahead.

83
00:08:15,779 --> 00:08:22,629
Wait, hold on a minute. Isn't Calamity Ganon over here? I have to be careful.

84
00:08:22,629 --> 00:08:26,740
Oh, what's the toothpaste story? You're right. I forgot to tell you.

85
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:30,759
Okay. So I was trying to, I'm multitasking, right?

86
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:34,759
So I'm brushing my teeth and like walking around getting the stream kind of ready.

87
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:38,039
Uh, cause it was like, oh, brushing your teeth takes like a few minutes

88
00:08:38,759 --> 00:08:53,100
and hold on a second. Pretty sick. Yeah. I think that deserves applause. I think.

89
00:08:53,820 --> 00:09:03,480
Oh, nice. All right. Thank you. I appreciate it. Thank you for that.

90
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:09,559
What about you? But you know, does that cover both of you?

91
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:15,450
All right. That covers both of you. Does that cover, wait, do you have something?

92
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:23,419
That covers both of you. Mr. Green.

93
00:09:25,019 --> 00:09:30,539
I'm not, how is that extortion? I just asked. I was like, is that covering both of you?

94
00:09:32,389 --> 00:09:39,190
That's like, ah, that's kind of fucked up. I get like a gift and I pointed the,

95
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:43,820
does that cover both of you? Oh shit. That means you want two things.

96
00:09:48,169 --> 00:09:50,970
All right. Anyways, the toothpaste story. So I'm walking around. I don't even know.

97
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:53,529
I forget where I was walking. Whatever. I'm going this way now.

98
00:09:55,299 --> 00:10:01,289
So I'm walking around brushing my teeth and I was, I, my switch wasn't plugged in.

99
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:07,779
So I'm like, shit, where's the cord to the switch? And I'm, I don't know.

100
00:10:07,779 --> 00:10:11,620
I'm kind of a monster of ultimate extreme convenience.

101
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:25,860
So I have a, I have an iPad that uses the USB-C right on the switch. And if I don't know where

102
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:30,259
that cord is, I will just rip it out of the back of the switch and plug it next to my bed.

103
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:41,190
It's just because it's just a USB-C power cable. So that's there. And hold on a second. I'm getting

104
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:51,269
speech jammed. So I'm trying to tell a story. Shut up. Yeah. Look over your head. It's fine.

105
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:03,240
I probably shouldn't be using this weapon, right? No, it's fine. This thing's good.

106
00:11:07,059 --> 00:11:14,500
Just pause it. I'm right here. I'll be fine. Okay. That's fine. So anyways,

107
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:18,980
these skeletons are the most annoying enemy in the game, by the way, just running.

108
00:11:19,539 --> 00:11:27,019
All right. So anyways, start from the beginning. I'll start from the beginning.

109
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:43,830
You don't really need to know, but Troy, where is it?

110
00:11:52,820 --> 00:12:09,539
Is it up top? It's below me. I think. Where is it? No, it's down here. Yep. Nice. All right. Cool.

111
00:12:10,259 --> 00:12:15,559
Let me heal before. Actually, we'll see what it is. All right. So anyways,

112
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:20,470
I'm walking around brushing my teeth. I'm trying to do two things at once. And I'm like, fuck,

113
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:24,389
I need my switch cord because I need it's plugged into the, where the bed is. So I pull it up from

114
00:12:24,389 --> 00:12:29,029
the wall. And as I'm walking, remember the toothbrush with a bunch of foaming toothpastes

115
00:12:29,029 --> 00:12:35,029
in my mouth. So I'm like, let me get it out of the back. And I go and I pull it out and I walk

116
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:40,549
and I start to pull the cord and it's a long cord. And there's a cup of water next to the,

117
00:12:40,549 --> 00:12:44,070
where the bed is, you know, I want a cup of water so I can sip on it while I, before I sleep and

118
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:49,509
stuff, when I wake up, whatever. So the cord kind of wrapped around the water and pulled it down.

119
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:57,350
And I went like this. I went like, Oh, like, cause I don't obviously don't want to spill shit. And I

120
00:12:57,350 --> 00:13:11,960
inhaled like a whole mouthful of fucking toothpaste and it still hurts. There's the whole story. You

121
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:31,500
deserved it. Yeah. Don't rush. Oh, it's too late to bet on this. I think combat trial. Oh,

122
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:47,269
I have a lot of good weapons though, but I'm scared. I want to use them all. This is just a,

123
00:13:47,269 --> 00:13:54,950
all right. This is a full recovery and hearts. I do defense, maybe I'm just going to go super

124
00:13:54,950 --> 00:14:11,220
hard. All right, here we go. Or there's another raid. Oh, there is another raid. I'm just getting

125
00:14:12,179 --> 00:14:21,220
everybody's channel. Holy shit. Uh, RT, RT game. What's up, man? Thanks for the raid.

126
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:35,350
Welcome everybody. Currently playing breath of the wild. Uh, probably shouldn't use this weapon.

127
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:44,700
This thing's very heavy. It's all right. Did you, I didn't tweet the stream out. Oh shit. Yeah,

128
00:14:44,700 --> 00:15:06,259
I'll tweet this remote. There it is. There it is. There it is. There it is. What? Don't hurt me.

129
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:13,450
All right. What should I, what should I use? Probably the, uh, no, I don't, I want to save

130
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:24,950
that or the battle X. Yeah, I get two of these. Come on. What do you got? I got stuck on the

131
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:54,259
fucking wall. How come I'm not locked on? I guess I am. What just happened? I'm all right. So bad.

132
00:15:54,259 --> 00:15:58,950
It's supposed to be an emote only mode. Turn it off. I don't want to see people write that.

133
00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:16,179
That was awful reaction speed, by the way. That is another raid. How many people have,

134
00:16:16,179 --> 00:16:25,990
is this like a joke on Twitch today? That's repster. What's up? Oh, right. I forgot what

135
00:16:25,990 --> 00:17:00,549
to do about this. That'd be something good at this. All right. Go ahead. Do the. Yeah.

136
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:31,190
Shoot your bow in the air. What is it doing? Oh shit. Right. You have to, you have to just

137
00:17:31,190 --> 00:18:21,380
sprint, right? What the fuck? Why did that take so long from do that? Nice. Nice. Okay. I forgot

138
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:26,500
what the thing on the bottom right was. Um, until two seconds ago, I thought that was my gas tank

139
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:35,380
for some reason. I was like, Oh, I'm full. Like, Oh my, I need gas or something. I don't know

140
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:56,460
what's in here. Frost spear attack when the blade glows blue to chill the air and freeze your foe.

141
00:18:56,460 --> 00:19:10,789
Yeah, bro. I have to shut up. Seriously. Um, tweet, tweet the stream. I don't even know.

142
00:19:10,789 --> 00:19:13,910
My phone's not even up here. I don't even know where I have no idea. My phone even is.

143
00:19:15,109 --> 00:19:21,420
It's not even up here. I tweet this. I will in a minute. I'll go take a pre break in like two

144
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:34,819
minutes. What should I get rid of? I don't think I can get rid of anything. Maybe the guardian

145
00:19:34,819 --> 00:19:48,089
spear is this thing. This thing kind of sucks, doesn't it? Yeah. Guardian spear is meh. Yeah.

146
00:19:48,170 --> 00:20:00,859
I'll use this instead. All right. So now I can think this should be enough to upgrade.

147
00:20:00,859 --> 00:20:14,579
You have Jojo's bizarre adventure here. Um, all right. Is that a good thing? Jojo's bizarre

148
00:20:14,579 --> 00:20:33,769
adventure here. Is this just like a swoop? He's talking about like a swoop. I got four of these

149
00:20:33,769 --> 00:20:56,859
now. Should I do? I'm going to health, health, health. All right. I'm streaming. Right. I forgot.

150
00:20:56,859 --> 00:21:02,230
I thought I was just sitting in the chair. All right. Let's go. Uh, I need to go to one of those,

151
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:14,220
uh, spirit places. Where's the nearest one? Although where's the guardian here? There was

152
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:23,740
that lizard guardian. Should I do the lizard? Should I try the lizard guardian that's behind

153
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:36,309
you? I think I was right about to do the lizard, uh, temple, right? What was that? Somebody just

154
00:21:36,309 --> 00:22:07,000
went like, what was that? Where's my mask? There's a Korok nearby. Okay. Well, where is it? Up there

155
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:31,450
in the stump. Probably in the stump. No help. Nothing. Oh, it is in the stump. All right.

156
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:45,619
Nice. You got all these bat wings and don't miss the bat man. Gotham night stream coming up in

157
00:22:45,619 --> 00:23:12,220
about an hour and a half or maybe an hour or so. Do I have something that can break this? Smash it.

158
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:30,869
Yes. Link. Stop climbing and smash it. Let go. This game is a 10 out of 10 for all of you.

159
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:50,059
This game is like a 9.9.8 now for me. Yeah. I mean, seriously, it was like a 10 out of 10.

160
00:23:50,700 --> 00:24:06,119
Just went down to a 9.999990. It's definitely at the top, right? It just started raining right

161
00:24:06,119 --> 00:24:28,940
when I get to this point. I'm trying to come up the tree. Can I just jump? I think I can just jump,

162
00:24:28,940 --> 00:25:06,740
right? The climbing gear on 9.9 is bigger than 9.10. You, uh, I'm a bit first. It's raining

163
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:14,569
really hard. Cut the tree down. Is that what will that work? Why would I want to do that?

164
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:24,859
Yeah. Nine. I know. Okay. I said 9.999999999990. That's higher than 9.1111. Yeah, I know.

165
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:44,420
The rain is almost over. We just have to wait five minutes. Just campfire and then sleep.

166
00:25:47,859 --> 00:25:53,460
I think that just sitting here for another 30 seconds will be fine. Climb the side of

167
00:25:53,460 --> 00:26:00,380
the stump instead. Is this not getting hit by the rain? I mean, it is, but maybe I can just leap up

168
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:25,259
here. Do the tweet while you wait. I got it right here. I'm going to tweet. I'm going to

169
00:26:25,259 --> 00:26:58,019
tweet while I wait. I'll be right back. Be right back. I'm going to tweet. Oh my goodness. Holly

170
00:26:58,019 --> 00:27:03,180
is so cute. Can I just tell you that? So I just walked, I was like, oh, I'm going to go find my

171
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:10,569
phone. I walked over and I noticed that my phone was on the ground, like in front of, like with,

172
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:17,670
she slid it under the door. For a second I was like, why is my phone on the ground? Oh, that's

173
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:30,069
right. That's okay. That was really sweet. Okay. All right. What's a good tweet? Breath of, well,

174
00:27:30,069 --> 00:27:43,740
I'm only going to be for Breath of the Wild for like an hour and 10 minutes. That's actually kind

175
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:51,819
of a funny, there's not another raid, right? No. Somebody just said that. I actually think that's

176
00:27:51,819 --> 00:28:12,180
kind of funny. Breath of the Wild for an hour and 10 minutes. That's so stupid. That's a banger tweet.

177
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:25,579
It kind of is. There we go. All right. Now everyone's going to know I'm live and take a

178
00:28:25,579 --> 00:28:52,759
look in that amount of time. We're good. I can get my seed here. I did it first. I have four of these

179
00:28:52,759 --> 00:29:01,980
now. I know you can't see it, but I have four. It's not enough. I don't think. Cool. All right.

180
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:19,609
So that's good. Let me go examine stuff. Where the hero's sword? Do I have to,

181
00:29:19,609 --> 00:29:23,799
should I just go back and do this? No, right. I need to have, right, right. I need to have a

182
00:29:23,799 --> 00:29:30,890
certain amount of HP to even attempt it. I'm going to go back here. Let's get another good view

183
00:29:31,690 --> 00:29:35,900
of the kind of the world around us from what tower? This tower here.

184
00:29:40,299 --> 00:29:47,589
You need 13 hearts. What's the, what do you mean? The top Twitter reply. LOL.

185
00:29:50,220 --> 00:30:08,539
Who's like the Joker? Let's see. This tweet sucks. All right. Guys, I don't use Twitter.

186
00:30:08,539 --> 00:30:20,279
I don't use anything. Okay. So what else should I do in the next like hour or so?

187
00:30:25,609 --> 00:30:36,329
It's an eye headache too. It's like right here. Do the tower. Oh, right. I was going to go to

188
00:30:36,329 --> 00:30:46,940
that tower. That's right. There's three more shrines in this area. Really? In the forest?

189
00:30:46,940 --> 00:31:00,970
Like this way? Shrines are my favorite part of this whole game. So I go over here. I don't see any

190
00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:18,059
inside the forest. They're inside the forest. Just teleport inside. I was just seeing if I

191
00:31:18,059 --> 00:31:38,089
could get a good view. I kind of have a bad time to get transported somewhere. Talk to the Koroks.

192
00:31:38,089 --> 00:31:45,190
Do you pretend to read comments out in chat? Um, I think what happens and I've seen people

193
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:49,109
be like, what are you talking about? I think as the chat moves fast and I only have a brief

194
00:31:49,109 --> 00:31:55,029
second to kind of go like this, I will see, I think a lot of streamers do this too.

195
00:31:55,029 --> 00:32:03,289
Where you will see like, let's say the sentence has 10 words in it. I'll see like word one,

196
00:32:03,289 --> 00:32:07,609
word four, five, six, and word eight. And I kind of have to be like, all right,

197
00:32:07,609 --> 00:32:15,269
I'm going to fill in the blank. Does that answer your question? Sometimes I can see the whole thing

198
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:20,359
depending how fast the chat is moving. All right. So I got to talk to the Koroks,

199
00:32:22,619 --> 00:32:25,180
which they're in like the village I'm imagining, right?

200
00:32:26,859 --> 00:32:42,309
They're like down in here. There's one here. Where's like the proper village village where

201
00:32:42,309 --> 00:33:04,359
they're all hanging out and there's like shops and stuff. Oh, it's you. All right. I have seeds.

202
00:33:04,359 --> 00:33:09,539
All right. How much is it? What should I get? Another weapon stash? It's three for another

203
00:33:09,539 --> 00:33:16,009
weapon. I have four. I feel like I'm always low on weapons. I always feel like I need more weapons

204
00:33:17,289 --> 00:33:22,200
or bow. I'm doing weapons. I'm always throwing stuff away.

205
00:33:26,519 --> 00:33:34,009
Fields are fine. Just dodge forehead. You know what I mean?

206
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:48,809
I don't think I have enough to do anything. Go into the tree now.

207
00:33:55,099 --> 00:34:10,710
Um, wait, who's that? Oh, you could it be your Mr. Hero. Mr. Hero is here. The mushroom on my

208
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:18,179
head suddenly sprouted today, so I knew something was up. It was a prediction that you'd come,

209
00:34:18,179 --> 00:34:23,940
I think. Us Koroks all got together and prepared some trials just for you, Mr. Hero.

210
00:34:24,659 --> 00:34:29,139
If you pass the very tough trials we prepared, pulling out the master sword would be a piece of

211
00:34:29,139 --> 00:34:35,989
cake. Probably. Among the trials is an extra tough one designed by me, the elder of Korok Forest.

212
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:45,320
So will you test your mettle in the Korok trials? I'll do it. You're gonna get conned eventually if

213
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:48,519
you just keep doing what everybody asks you to. Anyways, where was I? Oh yeah, the Korok trials.

214
00:34:49,079 --> 00:34:52,119
Long story short, you need to visit all the shrines in Korok Forest so that you can be

215
00:34:52,119 --> 00:34:59,380
considered a real grown-up. Trial one in the southwest forest. Trial of second sight. Trial

216
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:06,389
two in the northwest forest. The lost pilgrimage. Trial three. I would say the worst of the three

217
00:35:06,389 --> 00:35:11,860
movies. The test of wood. That does sound like the worst of them, by the way. That sounds like the

218
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:19,559
shittiest movie out of them all. You can overcome the Korok trials. Oh, and here comes Star Wars.

219
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:38,019
Episode eight. A test of wood. The other two were way cooler sounding. Okay, so I just have to go

220
00:35:38,019 --> 00:35:45,289
find them. What about you? It's Mr. Hero. Yay, Mr. Hero came to visit us in the forest. What

221
00:35:45,289 --> 00:35:51,349
took you so long? Peek's thought of a trial that will make Mr. Hero stronger. You won't have to

222
00:35:51,349 --> 00:36:06,409
fight and it's not scary. Thermofans that are in their mid-40s are plus twoing that. I would have.

223
00:36:06,409 --> 00:36:12,920
You'll need to be extra careful so I want to see a Bloopy. It's a blue glowy hoppy thing that glows

224
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:19,219
in the dark just about Peek's size. I just really want to see a Bloopy even if it's just a picture

225
00:36:19,219 --> 00:36:29,239
of one. All right, I'll take a picture of a Bloopy. What's a Bloopy? I knew you were a nice guy, Mr.

226
00:36:29,239 --> 00:36:41,400
Hero. Thanks for listening to Peek's requests. It's a little blue bunny. Oh, okay. Well, he just

227
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:48,019
explained it while I was asking you. I looked over, missed the part where he said what it was

228
00:36:48,019 --> 00:37:06,090
because I was asking you guys. Okay, cool. Anybody else have anything in here? I have plenty of food.

229
00:37:06,650 --> 00:37:14,409
Oh, Mr. Hero, welcome to the great Deku Tree's navel. Made a bed out of leaves just for you,

230
00:37:14,409 --> 00:37:19,849
Mr. Hero. Take as long as you like with yawns and disease. Um, I have full health, I don't really

231
00:37:19,849 --> 00:37:25,780
get it. You look like a million rupees. Yeah, I would have guessed that a Bloopy was a blue

232
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:39,559
rupee. That's what I thought it was. Sleep, sleep, sleep in the bed, sleep. Why is everybody saying

233
00:37:39,559 --> 00:37:52,070
sad? Mr. Hero. That just reminds me of Otto. I always say Mr. and then whatever Otto currently

234
00:37:52,070 --> 00:38:02,889
is doing. Oh, here you go, Mr. Treat. I looked, missed a good boy. Oh, Mr. Hungry, right? It's

235
00:38:02,889 --> 00:38:13,159
just he's Mr. whatever he's currently doing. Okay, here's the shop. Mr. Otto. All right, what do you

236
00:38:13,159 --> 00:38:30,119
have? Okay. Can we get a running gag for the rest of the stream? You mean you want me to do like Mr.

237
00:38:30,119 --> 00:38:38,250
Otto stuff for the rest of the stream? All right, where are these shrines? One was north west. Talk?

238
00:38:38,889 --> 00:38:47,480
To what? Ah, if you hope to extract the sword, you'll need to summon a hero's strength.

239
00:38:48,699 --> 00:39:01,699
Let us see how brightly your life force burns. The wise mystical tree. Okay, so I have to go

240
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:12,070
north west. So it's imagining it's probably here. Can I just go here? The other one was south

241
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:30,230
something south. I have to select the quest. I don't want to. Oh, this one. Where is it?

242
00:39:32,219 --> 00:39:52,469
There it is. Oh, very cool. Is anybody okay? I hate to say this because this is like a really cool

243
00:39:52,469 --> 00:39:59,929
thing. But when I see this sword, I don't think that looks powerful. I think that looks like it's

244
00:39:59,929 --> 00:40:06,860
on the shelf at Walmart. Like that exact thing is on the shelf at Target. And it's like it's

245
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:13,300
just like, look, it's a toy at Target. And I just go, it looks cool. But that thing's made out of

246
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:24,619
foam to me. Oh my god, I must hold my setup down. It's a cool and it sucks because that's

247
00:40:24,619 --> 00:40:37,940
like a really cool design, but it's turned into a full foam toy for me. Yeah, I've contemplated

248
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:43,659
buying it. Any times I've walked by that toy, I made not making the entire story up just to make

249
00:40:43,659 --> 00:40:50,679
it very clear. How many times I've walked by that sword at Target and gone, you know,

250
00:40:52,039 --> 00:40:55,639
that might look pretty good on my shelf. And then everybody in the audience is laughing.

251
00:40:55,639 --> 00:41:01,960
Like I'm a comedian. You know what I mean? Like, and I go like this. Look at the microphone. Like,

252
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:16,340
you what? Why are you clout chasing actual liar? Well, no, it's not entirely inaccurate.

253
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:31,619
Keep going and not get lost in the mist. Oh shit. I this is okay. Don't worry. I've got a cryptic

254
00:41:31,619 --> 00:41:37,460
little hint for you. Hungry trees will show you the way spy their iron to win the day.

255
00:41:37,719 --> 00:42:01,239
Didn't make that sound cool. Okay. So where do I go? I'm kidding. I'm not doing that again.

256
00:42:01,239 --> 00:42:08,599
I'm kidding. Everyone just freaked out. They're like, no, dude, don't do that again.

257
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:20,300
Okay. The trees have iron. They like the way you'll make your way out of here. Link any day,

258
00:42:21,909 --> 00:42:30,630
check the ground, check the air. What does that actually mean though? They have like iron deposits

259
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:52,980
on the ones that I can go walk over to or something. I just see somebody sitting. It's like a school

260
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:57,849
play to me. I just see somebody sitting like the person that plays the piano the whole time.

261
00:42:57,849 --> 00:43:02,489
You know, it's like that older like lady usually is playing the piano and right now there's a scene

262
00:43:02,489 --> 00:43:11,000
going on and she's sitting down in that little pit. It's like, like, and the kids are all up

263
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:19,960
there doing their scene. I don't think anybody realizes like how unbelievably talented and how

264
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:27,590
much stress that fucking job was. And I think a lot of them were just doing it for free. Oh, hey,

265
00:43:27,590 --> 00:43:31,349
you need to know literally all the music. You need to know every single song you needed. You need to

266
00:43:31,349 --> 00:43:36,789
be the cue for every single fucking actor. And by the way, you're going to an entire audience

267
00:43:36,789 --> 00:43:42,619
of people watching you play the piano and you are the quarterback of the entire show. What?

268
00:43:42,619 --> 00:43:52,199
That seems like you're the only, you're the sole musician of the entire play. Oh, there we go.

269
00:43:53,960 --> 00:44:20,739
Iron leads the way. No iron there. You know what else is crazy about those musicians?

270
00:44:22,409 --> 00:44:27,210
Those kids would just fuck up all the time and the timing would change in the song

271
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:34,550
in real time to change the song. So it matched what the kid was fucking singing.

272
00:44:35,190 --> 00:44:47,349
Do you understand how unbelievable that is? That's unbelievable. The song would change mid song and

273
00:44:47,349 --> 00:44:51,349
they would fix, fix, fix it. And I'm doing a different tempo, the same song, different tempo

274
00:44:51,349 --> 00:45:32,360
to match your singing. Okay. Well, there's another one iron. No, no iron. No. Oh my God. I didn't

275
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:40,710
want to do that. I was trying to zoom the camera in. I went the wrong way. Just find the iron in

276
00:45:40,710 --> 00:46:05,750
the trees. This one here is the iron in this one. What are you doing here? It's supposed to be like

277
00:46:05,750 --> 00:46:32,840
a magical forest. Wait, you want to shoot that? Yeah, no. Do I have to break it? I tried to swing

278
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:59,639
at it. Iron lights the way. It's the only way. Find your way through the forest. With luck,

279
00:46:59,639 --> 00:47:11,019
you won't act like a tourist. What was the poem? Yes. Yes. Yes. I don't know what that means.

280
00:47:12,820 --> 00:47:23,900
Go through them. Wait, that one has iron. Which one? The other one has iron in its mouth.

281
00:47:24,539 --> 00:48:01,639
I don't see anything else with iron. Like from here, this one. Okay. Iron camera, camera, camera,

282
00:48:01,639 --> 00:48:25,849
camera. Okay. Take a picture of it. Oh, and then I can track where the iron is in the mobs.

283
00:48:26,809 --> 00:48:38,539
Look at that. I get it. Then I can set it to the tracker. I get it. Okay. Let's do it. Start over.

284
00:48:40,619 --> 00:48:59,369
Yeah, that's fine. Start over. Okay. So first one's over here. Let's get the camera out and

285
00:49:08,329 --> 00:49:22,920
no. Gatorade. Yeah. Lightning. Yeah. Shoot it with a lightning arrow.

286
00:49:25,579 --> 00:49:29,019
I don't even have a lightning arrow. I don't even have shock arrows.

287
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:51,480
Lightning picture. Picture of a lightning. Take a picture of the lightning. Football. Football.

288
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:56,940
Football. He scored. Take a picture of the lightning. Blah, blah, blah. Fool. Fool. You're

289
00:49:56,940 --> 00:50:01,500
a fool. Put your arm in the air. It's this way, right? Because he's pointing this way.

290
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:29,400
Here's another one. Where are you pointing? Orc. Am I going to do this for like the whole time

291
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:47,349
before I play Gotham Knights? One of the mods just tell me where to go. All right. Just translate

292
00:50:47,349 --> 00:50:56,889
one of the hieroglyphics. What do they mean by this? Just translate one of them. The ref does

293
00:50:56,889 --> 00:51:05,139
not mean football. I'll tell you that much. Yeah. I mean, it's not that Legend of Zelda

294
00:51:05,139 --> 00:51:29,559
presents Madden 2025. It's the shape. All right. Well, I'm not helping you anymore.

295
00:51:29,559 --> 00:51:54,820
Piece of shit. Hey. Hey. Hey. Okay. Lightning. Arms up. Do I have to get struck by lightning?

296
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:57,059
Do I have to stand on top and like have lightning strike or something?

297
00:52:04,199 --> 00:52:09,610
Did I just fucking softlock myself? No. All right. Picture. Picture. Picture. Up, up, up, up, up.

298
00:52:21,670 --> 00:52:42,179
No, no. Octopus arm. Lightning. What shape are the arms making? Yeah. All right. Let me defend

299
00:52:42,179 --> 00:53:37,449
myself. I need to defend myself. I forgot that the magnet power was in the game. What is going on?

300
00:53:37,449 --> 00:53:52,440
It won't come out of the mouth. It was making a sound. Okay. Down, up, down, left. Why does it

301
00:53:52,440 --> 00:54:11,699
say like put it down? I can't. You're almost there, dude. Take a picture of it. When it's

302
00:54:11,699 --> 00:54:21,269
push, pull up, down, take a picture of it. It doesn't make any sense. Remember the poem.

303
00:54:21,269 --> 00:54:29,210
I don't remember the poem. Let me ask the guy again. I can dodge a fucking battleaxe. I can't

304
00:54:29,210 --> 00:54:35,050
wait. I cannot wait until everyone's like, oh, you know, I'm not going to like say he's like,

305
00:54:35,050 --> 00:54:39,769
you know, I'm fucking stupid anymore. Cause like that stream was crazy. Like, holy shit.

306
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:51,579
Hungry trees will show you the way. Spy their iron to win the day. Do I just have to hold it

307
00:54:51,579 --> 00:55:22,809
and walk away? Spy their iron. So where's the next one? Cause I'm currently permanently banned

308
00:55:22,809 --> 00:55:31,940
the person that told him to go back into the woods. Shit. Yeah, I did. Like two of you said

309
00:55:31,940 --> 00:55:37,059
to go do these. You're the reason why I looked over and I was like, yeah. All right. All right.

310
00:55:37,059 --> 00:55:51,690
Illuminati eyeball. Illuminati eye. The Illuminati. I don't know. Eyeball. Lightning in the eye.

311
00:55:52,570 --> 00:55:59,929
Illuminati eye. Lightning eye. Lightning in the eye. Shoot the eye with lightning. I don't have,

312
00:55:59,929 --> 00:56:13,980
I don't have any shock arrows. Magnet eye. Magnet eye. Magnetize the eye. Magnet on the eye.

313
00:56:14,710 --> 00:56:18,550
Why did I come in here? I'm going to leave. I'm going to leave. I'm going to go to the shrine.

314
00:56:19,110 --> 00:56:29,449
I can't get stuck here for like an hour. Magnetize the eye. Magnet eye. Magnet eye.

315
00:56:29,449 --> 00:56:34,170
Magnet eye. Magnet on the eye. I'm not getting stuck here for an hour.

316
00:56:34,889 --> 00:56:40,179
I would, this is like the street you come back to and you just like melt on the couch and you

317
00:56:40,179 --> 00:56:45,639
just don't care that like no one can watch you do this for an hour. Take a picture of the magnet

318
00:56:51,380 --> 00:57:02,460
frame. Magnet frame. Magnet then picture. But how do I even activate that?

319
00:57:20,679 --> 00:57:51,480
Magnet. What am I looking for? So magnet and then eye. Look. Magnet and look. Magnet then look. Eye.

320
00:57:52,360 --> 00:58:03,219
Magnet. Look. Magnet then look at the eye. Magnet then look. All right. I'm magnet,

321
00:58:03,219 --> 00:58:19,719
I'm magneting right now and I'm looking and nothing's happening. Don't magnet the iron

322
00:58:19,719 --> 00:58:43,699
because it'll show up in the, don't mag, just magnetize and walk around.

323
00:58:43,699 --> 00:58:57,719
Don't, I threw that. I didn't want to. All right. Where's the one from here then?

324
00:59:03,670 --> 00:59:23,500
I just heard Ollie laugh. I heard it. I just heard it. I overthink everything.

325
00:59:24,059 --> 00:59:34,760
Really? I always do this. I play chess when the game's playing checkers. I do it every time. I

326
00:59:34,760 --> 00:59:41,340
seriously do. The last time I was here, it was like, oh, I need to find the song and go to the

327
00:59:41,340 --> 00:59:46,139
beat and turn my back backwards to the song and go backwards. It's like, no, dude, the flame is just

328
00:59:46,139 --> 01:00:05,289
pointing in the direction you're supposed to walk. It was so simple. Okay. But where the hell is the

329
01:00:05,289 --> 01:01:05,210
other one? There's one right here. There it is. There it is. Yeah. Get over there. Edit your tweet

330
01:01:05,289 --> 01:01:12,570
stuck in the Kokiri forest for an hour and 10 minutes. I need to, I hate these enemies.

331
01:01:12,570 --> 01:01:22,250
They're so annoying. Skeleton enemies in every game are so stupid. They're like, you killed it,

332
01:01:22,250 --> 01:01:28,969
but you didn't. It's growing back to life. No, just die. Just let it be. Skeletons always do this.

333
01:01:29,769 --> 01:01:37,139
We need some variety in the skeleton enemies that we face in these games. They can't all be this.

334
01:01:37,940 --> 01:01:44,789
What have I happened to the skeletal mage, by the way, like just like casting like

335
01:01:44,789 --> 01:01:48,710
fucking fireballs and stuff. What happened? We haven't seen that since like Diablo two.

336
01:01:48,710 --> 01:02:03,000
There's a rusty shield. Feed me the age shield guarded by monsters. Eternal. My brother will

337
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:58,329
repay you in kind. I have to shut up. Okay. So that chest, where'd that chest go? That's it.

338
01:02:59,960 --> 01:03:15,820
One Amber, one Amber for doing this. Is there a leaf anywhere? Do I have anything? Can I just

339
01:03:15,820 --> 01:03:21,719
like swing this and now it needs to be a leaf. I don't have a leaf. I just swim over there.

340
01:03:26,010 --> 01:04:00,150
Oh, this one. Use the ice. Yeah, but I want to, when do I ever get to do this? Please place my

341
01:04:00,150 --> 01:04:56,150
chest in my mouth. The shield eaters brothers stole it from me. Okay. And what does that do for us?

342
01:05:00,329 --> 01:05:22,420
Oh hell yeah. That's sick. That's sick. Let's get a big fish.

343
01:05:33,260 --> 01:05:44,969
Do bets. Um, you can get it done quickly. Yeah, do it. Place your bets. Will I do this in

344
01:05:44,969 --> 01:06:07,059
seven minutes or less? Seven minutes or less? No bets. We do no bets. Just go. No, this one's

345
01:06:07,059 --> 01:06:34,219
just free. Wait. Oh, you mean like actually free? Oh, you're still betting. Who is betting against

346
01:06:34,219 --> 01:06:53,590
this? 25. Oh guys. Um, 32 million versus versus how many? 37, 38 million versus 900,000.

347
01:06:54,150 --> 01:07:08,019
Interesting. We'll be back in 10 minutes. Take a quick break. Can you imagine? Yeah, that was fun.

348
01:07:11,159 --> 01:07:25,670
Giant ancient core. These are important. I've been told that was a pretty cool shrine.

349
01:07:25,670 --> 01:07:32,969
The staircase going up was a little challenging trying to get like one, two, three, four, five,

350
01:07:32,969 --> 01:07:39,690
you know, one foot in front of the other. It was kind of a challenge. Now getting back down is

351
01:07:39,690 --> 01:07:42,809
another story though, because that's going to be a little harder. It's a little steeper.

352
01:07:53,800 --> 01:08:00,619
You're a scammer. I'm not a scammer. That was it. It will be a scam for me to keep that

353
01:08:00,619 --> 01:08:20,760
hole in place. So now I can just walk around. I'm going to go to the other ones. Yeah,

354
01:08:20,760 --> 01:08:41,189
bring me to the entrance. Ooh, the Luddy. Nice armpits. I burn so much fuel. I don't think

355
01:08:41,189 --> 01:08:54,859
people just don't get this. I burn so much fuel inside. There's not a heart in here.

356
01:08:55,420 --> 01:08:59,739
There is this like engine just with like, just like smoke and steam.

357
01:09:03,260 --> 01:09:24,310
I'm just like an engine that's constantly burning fluid and like fuel. I run so hot.

358
01:09:24,310 --> 01:09:40,869
I really am like a lizard. It's not a brain in there either. Apparently. Wow. You motherfucker.

359
01:09:49,210 --> 01:09:57,819
Whoa. That was, wow, that was rough. That was rough. I'll take that one. I just underhanded you

360
01:09:57,819 --> 01:10:11,460
of a fucking Nerf ball. Okay. Test of wood. You need to equip the Korok weapon set. Sure.

361
01:10:12,340 --> 01:10:17,659
You have to keep the sword, bow and shield equipped the whole time. If they break or you

362
01:10:17,659 --> 01:10:48,470
unequip them. I thought he said you die. I'm sorry. Oh my God. That didn't break in the face.

363
01:10:49,640 --> 01:10:59,319
I didn't think, I thought it was just going to phase through them. I'm so sad.

364
01:11:00,859 --> 01:11:11,659
I'm so sad. I didn't want to do that. My goodness. Okay. I have enough for, oh my God.

365
01:11:12,380 --> 01:11:20,220
I have enough for a shield. What about bow? I got to drop a bow, I think.

366
01:11:23,220 --> 01:11:52,220
Knight's bow probably. Yeah, I'll drop this. I've been using it. I feel so bad. Drop the frinic.

367
01:11:52,220 --> 01:11:58,500
Last time I wanted to drop the frinic, everyone was like, don't do it. Don't do it. It's like one

368
01:11:58,500 --> 01:12:04,779
of the best bows in the game. It's been sitting there the whole time. Go reach the shrine, but

369
01:12:04,779 --> 01:12:12,180
nothing can break. By the way, I just want to say, I'm really sorry to you. I'm trying to apologize

370
01:12:12,180 --> 01:12:32,069
to him. I'm really sorry that I threw that at you. Okay. We're cool. Do I need to fight anything?

371
01:12:32,069 --> 01:13:09,050
Why don't I just run? I don't have to fight anything. Just make it to the shrine. What happened?

372
01:13:09,050 --> 01:13:16,010
I have to stay in the fence. Oh, I jumped. That's why. All right. Well, I'm going to do this.

373
01:13:16,010 --> 01:14:01,210
I went out of bounds. Okay. I get it. That's fine. Okay. Stay in the fence. Does this

374
01:14:01,210 --> 01:14:27,609
count as staying in the fence right here? Does this count? That was scary. I can jump over this,

375
01:14:27,609 --> 01:15:06,949
right? I have to break these. Wait, don't unequip. How do I? I don't want to shoot this. Whatever.

376
01:15:06,949 --> 01:15:57,899
Okay. This way. What the hell was that? I should probably heal. What? Just run? Why would you tell

377
01:15:57,899 --> 01:16:07,930
me to do that right now? What? Just run? Just run into the quicksand. Dude, what are you doing?

378
01:16:07,930 --> 01:16:14,810
Just run. Run. Just run. So I just run. You didn't say just run in the parentheses bracket.

379
01:16:14,810 --> 01:16:19,770
Watch out for the quicksand. You said run in all capitals. Run. Run. So I did what you said.

380
01:16:20,489 --> 01:16:28,460
Jeremy, I'm really high. Have you ever seen your side profile? I feel like you would look like a

381
01:16:28,539 --> 01:16:45,579
moon. What do you think? Dude, just run. Hurry up. What are you doing? Stop stalling.

382
01:16:45,579 --> 01:16:55,430
Run. Just run. Okay. I'm just going to. I would have said if I was in the chat,

383
01:16:56,470 --> 01:17:04,920
dude, run, but watch out ahead. It's a cautionary quicksand here. So how am I supposed to get

384
01:17:04,920 --> 01:17:13,430
through this? I want to make ice. All right. Well, I have to kill some of these things.

385
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:38,539
Hmm. What should I eat? How about just like, yeah, I don't need whatever. I'll eat a roasted bass

386
01:17:40,310 --> 01:17:53,930
and an egg. No, that's enough. Not here. I mean, the chili fish skewer seems pretty good.

387
01:17:57,159 --> 01:18:07,640
Dude, watch out. Somebody say Wellington. Did you bring that back? Did somebody bring back the

388
01:18:07,640 --> 01:18:40,729
Wellington? Everyone hated that. I have to heal these things. This is so annoying. All right. Nice.

389
01:18:40,729 --> 01:18:56,699
We're good. I freaked out. I'm fine. Oh, you can have three. I thought you could only have

390
01:18:56,699 --> 01:19:12,550
two up at one time. Did that upgrade? I thought it was only two. It was three. It's always been

391
01:19:12,550 --> 01:19:21,479
three. Oh, I'm going to take another Tylenol. God damn it. All right. No, I'm going to relax now.

392
01:19:21,479 --> 01:19:44,100
I'm going to chill. Like I said, I was going to. I was trying to. No. I was like, what happened?

393
01:19:44,739 --> 01:19:50,180
I was trying to throw. I was trying to drop the stupid twig that I had equipped.

394
01:19:50,180 --> 01:19:54,010
I wasn't trying to unequip it. I was just trying to get rid of it. I should have just dropped it

395
01:19:54,010 --> 01:20:18,470
in my oven. Whatever. I got. You relaxed way too hard. Jeremy, you need to run, but be cautious

396
01:20:18,470 --> 01:20:23,510
where there is quicksand ahead. If you don't already know, quicksand is a dangerous and can quickly

397
01:20:23,510 --> 01:20:27,430
engulf link and potentially give you a game over. I hope this information is found useful in your

398
01:20:27,430 --> 01:20:31,590
playthrough of the Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild. Thanks. That's what I'm talking about.

399
01:20:36,090 --> 01:20:41,770
No, I, I'm going to drop that in the inventory. That counts, right?

400
01:20:41,770 --> 01:21:25,350
Jeremy, you should eat a slice of epic bacon. All right. Drop this stupid thing. Drop that.

401
01:21:25,350 --> 01:21:48,090
What else do I don't want that is just clogging up my inventory like a huge turd? Why did you say

402
01:21:48,090 --> 01:22:03,079
that? I don't know. I have a headache today. It's fucking fucked up and gross. I don't care.

403
01:22:03,960 --> 01:22:40,359
I just don't. Oh shit. It didn't jump when I hit the button. It didn't jump when I hit the button.

404
01:22:40,359 --> 01:22:45,720
It didn't jump when I hit the button. I, I hit, I swear to God, sometimes I will hit jump and the

405
01:22:45,720 --> 01:22:59,479
input will just not process because I'm on the wrong frame. Oh, it's like I hit the jump button

406
01:22:59,479 --> 01:23:03,960
and it's like a frame that isn't done being rendered. So it's like, no, you didn't.

407
01:23:08,739 --> 01:23:32,119
Actually, that is not a bad strategy though. Get past this quick. Um, wait, do I have defense?

408
01:23:32,840 --> 01:23:54,869
Yeah, I'm going to do the defense boost. Let's do speed instead. All right. Where's the fire guy?

409
01:24:20,840 --> 01:24:29,430
I promise you that like no human runs off an edge and doesn't press jump. I, I promise you,

410
01:24:29,430 --> 01:24:35,880
I promise you I'm hitting the jump button. I, I'm what I'm telling you. That's what's happening.

411
01:24:37,590 --> 01:24:42,229
Like no human is like, oh, I'm going to put that there. I'm just going to walk off the edge.

412
01:24:42,229 --> 01:25:01,180
No, you, I'm going to jump. No, we're doing it my way. You fucking idiot.

413
01:25:02,460 --> 01:25:06,220
It's just Mr. Bean episode. Every time I play breath of the wild, apparently

414
01:25:07,020 --> 01:25:35,699
it's literally an episode of Mr. Bean. I said I'm Mr. Bean. I'm going, I don't care. What are you

415
01:25:35,699 --> 01:25:57,100
linking me? Change the armor. I, okay. I am self flustered. You have no idea. I'm like, somebody,

416
01:25:57,100 --> 01:26:01,180
I looked over here and somebody linked me like a big bird walking around on the stage and I,

417
01:26:01,180 --> 01:26:06,859
I'm fucking flustered as hell. Somebody looking at the airplane window or something. I don't know

418
01:26:06,859 --> 01:26:23,539
what's going on over here. Did you, did you do Botox? No, I'm going to do it my way today.

419
01:26:23,539 --> 01:26:53,460
Why do I want to change my armor? It's not that hard. No, it's not. I'm just distracted.

420
01:26:53,460 --> 01:27:03,319
Let's get this up with better defense. Yeah. Okay. We're doing this my way.

421
01:27:31,510 --> 01:27:53,260
I need arrows. I have no arrows. I do now. Like, what can I take? Hey, oh, arrow. Okay.

422
01:27:53,260 --> 01:28:14,489
I actually would rather attack these guys. That's exactly what I needed.

423
01:28:52,869 --> 01:28:59,859
I need to buy arrows. Oh no, I don't. I am fucking furious. I already. Yeah. Okay. Here's the

424
01:28:59,859 --> 01:29:05,930
problem. I already beat this shit, but then I went into my inventory and scrolled to a different item

425
01:29:05,930 --> 01:29:10,409
in the game went, ah, ah, ah, you can't do that here. Ah, ah, ah. I wasn't trying to equip it. I

426
01:29:10,409 --> 01:30:01,850
was just trying to throw it away. I don't want my head hurts. What I don't care if this fucking

427
01:30:01,850 --> 01:30:30,840
thing breaks. I'm not embarrassing myself for another 10 minutes. Get up there. Do you have

428
01:30:30,840 --> 01:31:15,590
any arrows up here? Swing the sword. I beat the last boss in Sekiro in like less than three hours.

429
01:31:15,590 --> 01:31:30,619
I don't care what anybody says. Okay. So there's nothing else shooting at me. There's nothing

430
01:31:30,619 --> 01:31:39,050
else attacking me. Right. We're good. I'm to go and I can dodge a battle X in real life.

431
01:31:51,189 --> 01:32:08,649
I can't just launch it back at him and kill him. You go down too quickly. Don't you dare.

432
01:32:13,460 --> 01:32:28,460
The person's not even shooting at me. Okay. I'm going to block you. Good. Okay. Oh shit,

433
01:32:28,460 --> 01:32:37,800
it's going to break. Stop doing the Mario. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, everybody. I'm so sorry.

434
01:32:37,800 --> 01:32:41,800
I'm so sorry. Just doing the Mario thing where you jump because you make the jump,

435
01:32:41,800 --> 01:32:45,800
but then you freak out and you jump backwards and then you freak out and jump forwards.

436
01:32:45,800 --> 01:32:59,779
I did the Mario thing. You know what I mean? When you jump, you do a hard jump in Mario and

437
01:32:59,779 --> 01:33:03,619
you don't have the confidence that you made it. So you freak out and press the button again,

438
01:33:04,840 --> 01:33:08,520
which makes you jump a second time. And then you are overcompensating going backwards.

439
01:33:08,520 --> 01:33:17,800
You know what I'm talking about. I did the Mario. The game is not respawning the enemies.

440
01:33:17,800 --> 01:33:23,180
I think I broke the actual game. I'm getting, yeah. No, nothing's respawning.

441
01:33:31,220 --> 01:33:34,180
I'm just going to shoot you. I don't care how far away this is. I don't care what kind of

442
01:33:34,180 --> 01:33:40,539
fucking arrow type it is. You have to die. You too over there. I'm not going to get embarrassed

443
01:33:40,539 --> 01:34:00,170
again. Go ahead. Do it. Get up. Why are you all of a sudden? You don't want to get up now?

444
01:34:01,739 --> 01:34:35,510
Good. Where are you?

445
01:35:00,840 --> 01:35:20,789
Right there. I don't care how expensive these things are. It's worth it. There are a couple,

446
01:35:20,789 --> 01:35:25,239
look at there in the ground over here. See it? I can see them right there. There's one here and

447
01:35:25,239 --> 01:35:34,329
there's one here. How come I can't kill them? Oh, those are just twigs. I'm fine. What's this for?

448
01:35:35,529 --> 01:35:43,510
Did I just walk it up? Let's see. What's going on here?

449
01:35:45,189 --> 01:36:09,779
Ow. I just feel like I'm so nuts for this, but I don't care. I could have just made the jump,

450
01:36:09,779 --> 01:36:23,939
right? No, I don't care. If I skip it, is it going to be mad at me? Is it going to be pissed

451
01:36:23,939 --> 01:36:40,680
off if I do this? I'm not going to get disqualified if I do this, right? I made it. Oh my God. Thank

452
01:36:40,680 --> 01:36:48,659
goodness. I can finally. Oh my God. That was so, it should not have been like that. It just

453
01:36:48,659 --> 01:37:03,689
shouldn't have been like that. It shouldn't have been like that. I don't ever want to do that again.

454
01:37:03,689 --> 01:37:27,350
In fact, I want to delete that from my memory. It was fine. I got one more trial. What was the

455
01:37:27,350 --> 01:37:59,130
last one? Yeah, I think these are reward only shrines. Yeah, I have this would be number six

456
01:37:59,130 --> 01:38:08,899
for orbs. Did you drop the game to a nine point eight? No, it's still a nine. Well,

457
01:38:08,899 --> 01:38:27,260
it's a nine something so far. It's a nine something. It's definitely higher than nine point

458
01:38:27,260 --> 01:38:38,300
one. It's definitely lower than a nine point nine. You guys remember when I gave the outer wilds an

459
01:38:38,300 --> 01:38:57,079
eight point nine and everybody said I and everyone hated me for like a week. All right, let's go back

460
01:38:57,079 --> 01:39:24,699
to the beginning and look how long that took. Just teleport out. I just did. All right. The

461
01:39:24,699 --> 01:39:43,430
final trial of what's the name of this village? Oh, what is it? Mr. Hero. Hey, are you the hero?

462
01:39:43,430 --> 01:39:48,859
Could it be? Welcome to Korok Forest. You're much cooler looking than I thought you'd be. Hey,

463
01:39:48,859 --> 01:39:53,770
thank you. Would be sure you're up to the task. I prepared a trial. What do you think? Will you

464
01:39:53,770 --> 01:40:00,010
accept my trial? Yes. Show me a rod with the power of ice, please. You can wave this rod

465
01:40:00,010 --> 01:40:03,609
to freeze monsters in their tracks. Ice wizrobes love to. Oh, I have one of those.

466
01:40:04,329 --> 01:40:22,550
I have one of those. Look what I got. It's not what he wants. This is an ice rod, isn't it?

467
01:40:23,350 --> 01:40:29,159
This doesn't count. Is it? Oh, it's the it's the wand. OK, not like it's OK. I thought it had to

468
01:40:29,159 --> 01:40:50,649
just be like an ice weapon. Let's do the final trial. The little one thing. OK, cool. This game

469
01:40:50,649 --> 01:40:57,579
is so fun, though. You know what? OK, I'm going to make a I'm going to make an Elden Ring comparison

470
01:40:57,579 --> 01:41:00,619
because that's what I'm going to do. So I don't want to block your ears right now. Go for it.

471
01:41:01,500 --> 01:41:07,539
But I like how in Breath of the Wild, there's just a bunch of random shit to do,

472
01:41:08,890 --> 01:41:13,689
just a bunch of random shit everywhere. And it's not stupid shit.

473
01:41:14,489 --> 01:41:19,050
There's a lot of big open world games. They they say we got all this stuff to do, right?

474
01:41:20,439 --> 01:41:25,800
This is like handcrafted stuff to do. Like this is here, right? This is here.

475
01:41:26,949 --> 01:41:39,880
So they like made this completely unique to this area. It's great. I feel the same way about the

476
01:41:39,880 --> 01:41:44,619
Elden Ring was the same way where every every single spot, all the missions and all the quest

477
01:41:44,619 --> 01:41:49,720
felt like somebody's like handmade it. It wasn't just like, oh, we have this thing we can put here

478
01:41:49,720 --> 01:41:52,439
and this thing we can put here. It was like, oh, no, you're making this area. You're going

479
01:41:52,439 --> 01:42:03,560
to hand make this area. What's wrong? I told you to stop scaring me. What's what's going on?

480
01:42:03,560 --> 01:42:17,640
I have to go back. Oh, OK. I'm ready for the trial. Yes, I am. My little Oki just now set

481
01:42:17,640 --> 01:42:22,199
off to do the trial. Normally I'd go along, too, but Oki insisted on going alone. I'd let

482
01:42:22,199 --> 01:42:26,979
Oki go. But well, I'm just getting worried. Would you please follow Oki without being seen?

483
01:42:26,979 --> 01:42:34,859
I want to make sure nothing happens. He's right there. Look over there. So just make sure nothing

484
01:42:34,859 --> 01:42:50,939
bad happens. This is an escort quest and don't get seen. What are you talking about?

485
01:42:51,739 --> 01:43:21,699
All right. I have to crouch. I have to crouch. All right. Go on. Do what you're going to do.

486
01:43:22,340 --> 01:43:56,409
I need like a GTA mission line above his head. When it fills up, I lose. Shit. Where to go?

487
01:44:13,029 --> 01:45:22,039
Where to go? Where to go? Oh, there you are. Don't I have a stealth thing? Speed, speed. Where's

488
01:45:22,039 --> 01:46:10,439
stealth? The purple one? Let's eat this. What are you coming over here? Don't look over here.

489
01:46:18,300 --> 01:46:22,699
You know, escort quests I think could do with a little bit of kind of reimagining.

490
01:46:22,699 --> 01:46:28,119
How much more fun would this be if it was like, oh, yeah, by the way, he's really reckless.

491
01:46:28,119 --> 01:46:33,000
And instead of just the walk behind the person, it was they were sprinting through and aggroing

492
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:50,220
the entire forest. Like they just aggro everything and it's just chaos. Do you guys

493
01:46:51,020 --> 01:46:56,949
Warcraft reference? Here it comes. Remember in Warcraft, you do the escort quest and you'd get

494
01:46:56,949 --> 01:47:02,869
attacked by like five people and the escort would sprint way out of the way to fight.

495
01:47:03,430 --> 01:47:07,109
And then after the big fight was done, they would run all the way back to where they were

496
01:47:07,109 --> 01:47:20,039
currently walking from. Hey, they would walk, run all the way back to where they were walking from

497
01:47:20,039 --> 01:47:28,170
and then start slowly going again. Like the game did not, their AI did not allow them to go further

498
01:47:28,810 --> 01:47:40,039
unless they were walking the exact path they had to walk. What are you doing? What are you doing?

499
01:47:40,600 --> 01:48:08,149
Get out of the fucking way. What happened? Hey, what's going on?

500
01:48:12,630 --> 01:48:46,920
Don't do this to me now. I'm in the middle of something. What are we doing right now?

501
01:48:46,920 --> 01:49:28,300
It's just a shadow. I'm not fucking around. I don't care if it's too long. Are you turning around?

502
01:49:28,300 --> 01:49:31,960
What are you doing? Are you walking forward? I can't tell. You're just a blob.

503
01:49:56,010 --> 01:50:28,390
Don't walk into the fire. Okay. Where'd he go? Where'd he go? Where is he? Where'd he go?

504
01:50:28,390 --> 01:50:34,550
Where is he? I don't see him. I don't. Where'd he go? I actually don't know where he is.

505
01:50:34,550 --> 01:50:38,520
Where is he? I don't see him at all. I don't see him. I don't see him. Where is he? Where is he?

506
01:50:38,520 --> 01:50:46,470
I actually, I'm serious. I don't know where he is. Which way? Which way? Which way? I don't. I can't.

507
01:50:46,470 --> 01:51:02,920
I'm serious. Where is he? Right? I didn't see where he went. Oh, there he is. I got it. I got it.

508
01:51:02,920 --> 01:51:22,260
Thank God. All right. Something weird happened here. I made it. Yep, you did.

509
01:51:23,930 --> 01:51:48,340
Are we good? Can I go and talk to him now? You did it. Nice job. Guess what, Mr. Hero? I did the

510
01:51:48,340 --> 01:51:53,500
trial by myself. Aren't I brave? You're probably here for the shrine. The great Deku Tree said

511
01:51:53,500 --> 01:51:57,260
that the monk's blessing is waiting in the shrine ahead. Why don't you go take a look?

512
01:51:57,260 --> 01:52:22,569
Nice job. You did it. Nice work. You did the trial. I did it. Nice. All right. I did all the forest

513
01:52:22,569 --> 01:52:42,439
or at least the shrine stuff. Do I get anything for doing all of it? Do you imagine a bomb

514
01:52:43,079 --> 01:52:52,380
is going, like an explosion goes off next to you? Like, oh, what was that? I didn't have to,

515
01:52:52,380 --> 01:53:05,020
I just shot an arrow. Ancient core. Cool. Yeah. So what's the, is there a, you did all three trials.

516
01:53:05,020 --> 01:53:28,279
Do I get anything? Go upgrade your stasis. Is that from the village? Looks like you have plastic

517
01:53:28,279 --> 01:53:41,829
surgery. I don't know. Is that a good thing or a bad thing? I love how you say this guy, but you've

518
01:53:41,829 --> 01:53:48,899
been a sub for like three months at least. You know who I am. You know what, you, you're, you're

519
01:53:48,899 --> 01:54:03,659
here and you, you're here. Hey dude, this guy, you know who I am. You were hanging out here.

520
01:54:03,659 --> 01:54:24,260
All right, let's turn it in. Celebrity meltdown. Welcome back to celebrity meltdown. Funnyman

521
01:54:24,260 --> 01:54:33,819
streamer German985 had a little bit of a problem in the lost forest in Breath of the Wild. Could

522
01:54:33,819 --> 01:54:41,479
not quite figure out that trial. Our sources say that after the stream ended, Mr. Albertson actually

523
01:54:41,479 --> 01:54:51,899
took a bite out of his drywall and then had to go to the dentist shortly after. All right, what do

524
01:54:51,899 --> 01:55:03,529
I get? It's only a matter of time before you're able to pull the master sword. Hurry up and show

525
01:55:03,529 --> 01:55:08,149
us what you got. Ah, I know that look. You want me to give you something since you visited all the

526
01:55:08,149 --> 01:55:14,119
places, don't you? Yes, I have no choice. I'll give you my treasured item. Big hearty truffle times

527
01:55:14,119 --> 01:55:35,340
three. Okay. This is like the, this is no omega truffle. Cool. That was fun. I want to go, I need

528
01:55:35,340 --> 01:55:44,100
to upgrade my health. Is there one of those trying things in this town? I'm going to have to go back

529
01:55:44,100 --> 01:55:57,060
to the village in the tree. This one inside because I have enough to do. I'll do health.

530
01:55:57,060 --> 01:56:18,630
They did stamina twice. Where is it? Where is it? Sleep in the bed. Oh, okay. I want to do a heart

531
01:56:18,630 --> 01:56:44,699
container. Thank you. Cool. Now somebody said you can say I can upgrade the stasis. Where do I do

532
01:56:44,699 --> 01:56:51,449
that? Have you finished the game? No, not even close. I don't think I'm even at the halfway point.

533
01:56:51,449 --> 01:57:02,859
I have one guardian down. I'm about to do the second guardian in the lab. That was, where was

534
01:57:02,859 --> 01:57:34,170
that? Where's that lab? I feel like it was up. Wasn't it up? It's in the bottom. Oh, okay. Still

535
01:57:34,170 --> 01:57:57,909
think I can't dodge a battle axe after hearing that. All right. Let's go. All right. In here.

536
01:57:57,989 --> 01:58:12,310
Let's talk to you. Good morning. Did you bring me any ancient materials? Yes. Which rune do you want

537
01:58:12,310 --> 01:58:54,899
to power up? Stasis. Three ancient cores. Yes. Thank you. Charging your phone. I like this little

538
01:58:54,899 --> 01:59:05,699
iPad. I like it. Powered up stasis rune can now time stop evil creatures. The stored energy will

539
01:59:05,699 --> 01:59:11,979
act upon the object when the flow of time. Wait, you can, I can freeze people now? That seems kind

540
01:59:11,979 --> 01:59:27,829
of good. It seems really good. What's this? Perhaps you already went and powered them all up.

541
01:59:28,569 --> 01:59:32,569
Suppose your Sheikah slate and your legendary swordsmanship have, we have nothing to fear.

542
01:59:33,210 --> 01:59:53,060
Nothing at all. Calamity Ganon. All right. So I think I'm going to take a little BRB here.

543
01:59:53,939 --> 02:00:01,100
There's our couple of hours of Breath of the Wild. Going to move on to, let's hear it. I want

544
02:00:01,659 --> 02:00:08,300
everyone to say all capitals. What are we moving on to? All capitals. All capitals. Pump everybody

545
02:00:08,300 --> 02:00:20,579
up. Pump everybody up in the chat. All right. I'm going to be right back. I'm going to pee.

546
02:00:20,579 --> 02:00:26,739
I have to set up some stuff. We're going to play Gotham Knights. Sponsored. This is the last stream

547
02:00:26,739 --> 02:00:32,460
of Gotham Knights you'll see that's sponsored for the culmination of the last three days.

548
02:00:34,470 --> 02:00:39,189
Yeah. Probably play, I did, I do want this to be kind of a shorter stream. I have stuff I need to

549
02:00:39,189 --> 02:00:46,550
do and I don't want my eyeball to blow out of my right side of my head. So I'll tell you what we're

550
02:00:46,550 --> 02:00:57,779
going to do after Gotham Knights. What's today? So I will not be live for the next few days.

551
02:01:00,970 --> 02:01:18,199
The next time you will see me live, we'll be on. This is interesting. Probably I will be live for

552
02:01:18,199 --> 02:01:26,630
a short stream on the 21st. I'm still streaming. I'll be back on the 25th in the afternoon.

553
02:01:28,409 --> 02:01:30,810
I'll give you one second. I'll be right back. We're going to play Gotham Knights for a couple

554
02:01:30,810 --> 02:01:39,739
of hours and I might do some co-op too. Cause then I think WB I think wanted to show the co-op.

555
02:01:40,890 --> 02:01:48,149
So we'll see. I'm going to take a break. I'll be right back. No one cares about your eyeball.

556
02:01:48,149 --> 02:01:55,720
I care about my eyeball. I don't want it to break. But yeah, once, um, once I'm back, uh,

557
02:01:55,720 --> 02:02:01,079
in the last kind of this last kind of area of October, like the 29th, 30th and 31st,

558
02:02:01,079 --> 02:02:08,100
we're going to do a ton of Halloween shit. So be right back. Give me two, three minutes.
