1
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:46,299
Hey what's up? What's up? Today's the day. Final Fantasy 16 is out! I've actually been waiting

2
00:00:46,299 --> 00:00:52,859
for this. I had a lot of fun with the demo. I'll give you a quick little update of what the plan

3
00:00:52,859 --> 00:01:00,090
is before we get started. What about where's the smurf report? Well, what the fuck is that?

4
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:07,640
Why did somebody just electrocute the chat with one... was it a euro? What was that?

5
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,920
Is there... why is there money? Wait, what are these different...

6
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:23,819
is there one euro at the top? Is there a new money thing? Do you see this? What is this?

7
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:40,810
Hype. Derma Go. Why is it gone? When are you gonna take the dino quiz? What on earth is happening?

8
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:48,260
Okay, this is weird. I feel like I'm... I feel like I'm playing a like mobile game and I have to like

9
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:51,939
press these to get them. If I don't touch these at the top, I feel like I don't get them.

10
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,560
And then they disappear. So if I don't click them, do they go away?

11
00:02:00,219 --> 00:02:04,939
Okay, I just to make sure everyone's aware of this. I think you're giving real money.

12
00:02:04,939 --> 00:02:08,860
Just to make sure you're clear on that. You guys are giving real money right now. I don't know.

13
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:17,590
I don't know what this is. But just be aware. This is you're spending real money. What is it?

14
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:30,330
Okay. Well, interesting. I think they know. Play Kingdom Hearts. Hold on. Hold on a second.

15
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:45,080
I think it's bugs in your brain making you see things. If this is... If this sticks around,

16
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:48,120
I'm gonna have to... I'm gonna make... I think I might have to make a few changes.

17
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:57,000
Does it... Can I... How do... All right. Well, this is interesting. All right. Anyways, hello.

18
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:08,340
Welcome, everybody. Today, I'm gonna be playing Final Fantasy 16. Sponsored stream. Thank you to

19
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:13,139
Square Enix for sponsoring this stream. I'm very excited to play it. I don't know if it was...

20
00:03:13,139 --> 00:03:16,419
Probably wasn't hard to tell at the end of the demo, but I genuinely think this is gonna be

21
00:03:16,419 --> 00:03:25,960
really fun. And here's the best part. The best part is we don't have to do the demo again.

22
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:33,659
You start right from where we left off in the demo. Are you gonna do Next Fest? I am. I'm gonna...

23
00:03:34,219 --> 00:03:38,860
So here's the thing. I was thinking about doing half the stream Final Fantasy and then half the

24
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:51,530
stream as the Next Fest. But I'd rather just do it this weekend and play Sorcery this weekend.

25
00:03:52,330 --> 00:04:05,080
And okay. Hold on a second. Let me just do one thing real quick. Where the hell is your face?

26
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:17,779
My face is hanging out. Sorcery needs its own stream. We'll figure it out. Don't worry. Don't

27
00:04:17,779 --> 00:04:25,860
worry. So wait, these are pinned... These are pinned messages and they stay up longer depending

28
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:31,259
on... Well, I just want to make it really clear. I am not clicking on any of these. So just to be

29
00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:35,180
aware, they stay up longer depending on how much money you give. I just want to make sure

30
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:39,029
everyone's aware. I'm not... I haven't clicked on any of them. I think the point is like I'm

31
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:43,750
supposed to click on these and be like, oh, this person has a chat pinned up here. They're all

32
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:47,029
gone by the time I click on them. I'm not gonna click on any of these. I just want to make sure

33
00:04:47,029 --> 00:04:53,689
you know that. Well, I'll click on this one. This one says the CCO of Offbrand calls hype chats.

34
00:04:54,939 --> 00:05:06,040
What? So I've said my thing. I'm not gonna click on any of these.

35
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:13,019
I'm sorry, but like maybe I don't know. Let me... Let's just go through today and I'll figure out

36
00:05:13,019 --> 00:05:33,660
if I want to keep that or not. Okay. Okay. Streamers, you can't tell how much they're really

37
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:42,620
spending. Yeah. Some of them are just different currencies. I feel like I'm like Forex trading

38
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:49,189
in my chat room. Like a Canadian and then we have like English pounds and we all... I feel like I'm

39
00:05:49,269 --> 00:06:09,560
trading up here like Forex. Well, all right. So that's a feature now, just so you know.

40
00:06:10,839 --> 00:06:15,720
Let's make it really clear. I just said it. I ain't reading any of this. So just to let you know,

41
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:20,680
I know we have this policy where I don't really read anything that comes in monetarily, but that

42
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:25,879
also applies to here. I'm not gonna read any of these. Just to let you know, I have to be

43
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,120
consistent and I got to be transparent with you. There you go. Okay. I appreciate it nonetheless,

44
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:38,660
but thank you. But let's, let's go. Let's go. I ain't reading all that. No, not an,

45
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:52,329
I ain't reading all that. I just, I ain't reading all that. Wait, wait a second. Hold on.

46
00:06:53,290 --> 00:07:01,259
You cannot opt out of hype chat as we wanted to, but you can set a minimum. You can set a minimum

47
00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:13,079
of a hundred dollars. Okay. Well, let's just, I'm just going to leave it as it, but you know,

48
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:17,990
make it like, I don't know. I can't make, I, you know what? We're going to have to, I think.

49
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:26,170
All right. Just, it's a new feature. It's there. Let's just play. Let's play. I got a sponsorship

50
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:31,529
for you to do right now. You know what I'm saying? Set it at like a billion dollars. So nobody can do

51
00:07:31,529 --> 00:07:47,980
it. You must read them. No, now run ads. No, I'm not doing anything. All right. I'm, I have a,

52
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:55,959
let's go. It'll, it'll play out for a little bit. It's all right. I appreciate it nonetheless,

53
00:07:55,959 --> 00:08:03,720
but I ain't reading all that. All right. There you go. If, if, if we need to make it a little

54
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:08,839
higher, so it's not spammed, we will, but it's a new feature, I guess. Cool. Okay. Anyways,

55
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:20,250
Final Fantasy 16. Wow. Wowee. Here it is. Get to pick up right where we left off in the demo.

56
00:08:25,209 --> 00:08:33,700
I'm excited. I cannot wait to hear that battle music like a thousand more times. Yes, it is an

57
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:41,769
ad. This is hashtag ad. This is sponsored by Square Enix. Keep that in mind, but I'm having

58
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:51,899
a blast in the demo. It seems like I'm, I don't know. I, I'm, I think this is going to be pretty

59
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:58,549
gosh darn fun. All right. You guys ready? Let's go. You want to, you get a face game if you're good.

60
00:08:58,549 --> 00:09:06,230
You'll get a face game if you're good. Only if you're good. All right. So I'm gonna,

61
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:18,899
it's probably this one here. What about the Super Mario RPG remake? Huh? What are you talking about?

62
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:28,899
What are you talking about? He's making stuff up. It's real.

63
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:45,080
I like when people make up. It's real. Uh, no, that's cool. I'm glad they didn't just

64
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:52,570
port it. Uh, I'm excited. Hopefully it's really good. I'm looking forward to it. That's, I mean,

65
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:56,250
I feel like collectively everybody that has that in their top 10 favorite games of all time,

66
00:09:56,889 --> 00:10:01,929
I think everybody just kind of had a sigh of relief when they did that first little intro

67
00:10:01,929 --> 00:10:08,570
when it was like, okay, this is a port. And then they did the, wait a minute. Here comes the

68
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:12,809
magical star that's flying over and turning everything to 3D. I think everyone was like,

69
00:10:12,809 --> 00:10:23,960
oh, okay. Oh, okay. This is real. Yeah. Uh, I would, I would be lying to you if I didn't tell you.

70
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:30,379
I was not excited for that because it seems cool. All right. Ready? I am excited. If you don't know

71
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:37,220
the story of Final Fantasy 16, uh, you probably have to go watch the VOD, but the game is officially

72
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:44,740
out. It's out right now. It launched today. PlayStation five. Let's freaking go. Additional

73
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:48,419
content is now available for redemption. These items can be claimed from the system tab. Ooh.

74
00:10:50,809 --> 00:11:08,659
All right. Let's do it. This should pick up right with the demo left off. Yeah. It'll pick up 13

75
00:11:08,659 --> 00:11:21,960
years after the demo. Wait, wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait. Is it correct? Welcome back. Sorry.

76
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:31,980
What's our situation? Let's just say Shiva and Titans little spat hasn't made things any easier.

77
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:49,769
Lord check. No, wait. Good call. Let's just get a quick little rundown. Wait, what? Lord check.

78
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:57,669
Wyvern. Oh, that's okay. All right. I remember. I remember. Yes. Yes. But at the very end,

79
00:11:57,669 --> 00:12:01,110
we were, we were a soldier now. All right. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Okay. All right. Good thing.

80
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:07,529
This exists. I swear. I'm telling you. Slave soldier for the Holy empire of Sam Brickay. Now

81
00:12:07,529 --> 00:12:12,950
in his 13th year of servitude, drafted as a frontline infantryman, the magical might granted

82
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:17,830
him by the blessing of the phoenix quickly saw him promoted to an elite squadron of assassins.

83
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:24,179
He was assigned the moniker by which he is now known. Interesting. Okay. I am really glad this

84
00:12:24,179 --> 00:12:30,919
exists because I was going to just ask why the fuck is this guy's name not Clive? I was like,

85
00:12:30,919 --> 00:12:43,100
what happened? Oh, right. Bastards. Okay. Unit of Imperial army assassin tasked with taking the

86
00:12:43,100 --> 00:13:01,909
head of the iron kingdom's dominant warden of ice and vessel of the icon Shiva. Got it. Go. And

87
00:13:01,909 --> 00:13:07,179
it's as you thought, the crusaders have sounded the retreat. Then we follow.

88
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:15,320
We need to change your title. Well, if we return without Shiva's head, our fate will be no different

89
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:21,320
from Beasts. I'll take my chances with the iron blood. At least then I might die fighting

90
00:13:23,909 --> 00:13:36,730
after you do. That is the misleading title right now. No, it's not. No, it's not. When I get

91
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:46,389
control, I tweeted that too. Not today. Then it's settled. No dying. Now, if you don't mind,

92
00:13:46,389 --> 00:13:59,190
we have an army to chase. Go. All right. A chance encounter. The iconic abilities,

93
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:04,230
scarlet cyclone and heat wave for the phoenix are now available for acquisition and upgrade

94
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:09,029
on the abilities tab in the main menu. Do not forget that once acquired new abilities must

95
00:14:09,029 --> 00:14:13,830
be equipped on the gear and icons tab. How do they expect us to kill something that can do this?

96
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:21,750
They don't. Only the girl holding its leash. They now it's not misleading anymore.

97
00:14:27,899 --> 00:14:30,220
I have to make sure my tweet and my title makes sense.

98
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:46,919
Should I keep the, um, this control scheme? I feel like if it now is time to learn how to

99
00:14:46,919 --> 00:15:03,980
do the other one or go to the, um, what is it? Type B, right? What sprint does sprint, right?

100
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:23,669
Ooh, do type B. It's going to be way better in the long run. Uh huh. So I want to do

101
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:36,389
type B. It is on type B. Okay. All right. So that this is circle is evade. I'm going to take a

102
00:15:36,389 --> 00:15:41,590
little bit of extra getting used to it because I did the tutorial with type A. So it might take

103
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:45,029
me like a little bit to get used to it, but it's probably better. Like you said, in the long run,

104
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:59,269
we have a face game. We've been good. No, no, not yet. What is sprint or run? I could lock on his

105
00:15:59,269 --> 00:16:08,340
Elvon cycle. Icons is triangle. R2 is magic on this one. Square is ready. Iconic ability.

106
00:16:13,909 --> 00:16:27,860
No face game. You have to wait. I'm waiting for your birthday. Your birthday is in like 20 minutes.

107
00:16:31,669 --> 00:16:45,779
Your birthday is in 20 minutes. Okay. What's your iconic ability? Being able to go like this.

108
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:54,759
For a long time and hold the note. Titan has knocked the fight out of our iron blood and

109
00:16:54,759 --> 00:17:09,049
the rest of them can't be the main host. Wait. Our fortunes have turned sergeant. It's her,

110
00:17:09,049 --> 00:17:15,210
the dominant. Are you certain the crystalline orthodox is a backwards faith for a backwards

111
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:21,529
people in the iron kingdom? They teach the dominance are unclean aberrations born of

112
00:17:21,529 --> 00:17:26,009
blackest sin. Only their priests are allowed to perform the rights of priming.

113
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:30,490
And I see many. Change it live to Wyvern if you want in the title.

114
00:17:35,779 --> 00:17:41,910
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Let's go.

115
00:17:53,430 --> 00:18:10,619
Holy shit. Nobody messes with the bastards.

116
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:39,500
Okay. Hey, what? Wait, what?

117
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:59,450
Understood. Should have done a lower check. I got to get the controls down. So there's like a

118
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:09,049
parry. There's a parry. There's a, okay. That's the magic. Magic is if I want to do the,

119
00:19:10,329 --> 00:19:17,299
sorry, I am, I am hyping up right now. Okay. So that's if you want to do the combo

120
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:32,410
and then holding instead of it's where and then what is it? What button is that? Is it up?

121
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:42,180
What button is that? Okay. That's our two. That's our one. All right. How do I do this

122
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:50,599
phoenix shift when it comes to the new control scheme? Lock on. What? Oh, okay. L2 is phoenix

123
00:19:50,599 --> 00:20:03,670
shift. All right. Got it. Oh, shit. What does that say? Shit. Shit. What does that say?

124
00:20:12,579 --> 00:20:26,059
What? Why did that happen? They're having an auto update. Whatever. I'm going to get like

125
00:20:26,059 --> 00:20:31,799
ticks from mom up there apparently. All right. I gotta, I gotta learn, I gotta learn to get my

126
00:20:31,799 --> 00:20:42,309
controls back. I got a whole new control scheme. All right. You know what? You know, you know what?

127
00:20:42,309 --> 00:20:51,289
I think I'm going back. I think I'm going back. I got used to it. I'm going back. Yeah, I'm going

128
00:20:51,289 --> 00:20:59,589
back. I know. I know. One's like, no, no, no, no, but I got used to it in the demo and I got to use

129
00:20:59,589 --> 00:22:00,730
it. Yep. She's not even fully primed. Shit. All right. It's square and triangle, square and

130
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:05,099
triangle. I'll get it. I'll get it. I'll get it. It's just a good warmup. It's a good warmup.

131
00:22:25,019 --> 00:22:56,710
Do I have enough heals? Yeah, I'm good. Oh shit. All right. We're good. Okay. I went to type A,

132
00:22:56,710 --> 00:23:00,470
then I went to type B and I went back and I went forward. I got it. I got it. I figured it out

133
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:14,700
quick. Can you dodge roll? It is a dodge. Okay. Frozen tier crafting. Very nice. I probably

134
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:34,490
shouldn't lower check. Moves are cool. They are. I want to look at the upgrade tree. Is she dead?

135
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:48,869
I don't think so. Well, what are you waiting for? Oh, we, okay. We don't need to lower check. I know.

136
00:23:49,349 --> 00:24:32,599
What are you here? Bloody do it then. What the? Jesus. Company Wyvern. You've dodged that? Yeah,

137
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:41,900
a hundred percent. What the hell are you doing? Get your ass over here and help me with these

138
00:24:41,900 --> 00:25:06,700
bastards. We're the bastards. Which ones do you mean? Sorry Jill. All right. Let's go. What is

139
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:22,019
wrong with you Wyvern? Dominant. I know her. All right. It's L1 is lock on. Yep. There we go.

140
00:25:22,019 --> 00:25:35,319
That's what I'm looking for. Is there a better way to kind of flick between? Okay. It's bright

141
00:25:35,319 --> 00:25:56,359
stick. Let me get the dodge down again. That was my kill. That's done. Won't ask you again, Wyvern.

142
00:25:57,319 --> 00:26:11,109
Take her head so we can be done with this. I can't. I won't. We have to fight? Betray the holy empire?

143
00:26:11,829 --> 00:26:18,069
Betray? I don't recall ever pledging allegiance to your emperor. My service may have been bought

144
00:26:18,069 --> 00:26:27,619
with this brand, but not my loyalty. I just fight to survive. Really? We have to fight you?

145
00:26:28,579 --> 00:26:32,259
Are you dead? Wait, what is going on?

146
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:42,390
All right. I gotta, I gotta, I gotta play now. I gotta play.

147
00:26:56,039 --> 00:27:23,059
You're not going to hit me. You'll never hit me. Top it off.

148
00:27:23,059 --> 00:27:24,819
Did you think you'd get tired of just wearing it that many times?

149
00:27:41,619 --> 00:27:46,420
I've always had a name. And I've not forgotten it. It's Clive.

150
00:27:51,099 --> 00:27:59,930
Oh. Oh.

151
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:43,589
Oh, this is fucking fun.

152
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:09,619
Cool. All right. See, I got it. Need to take a vinegar. So

153
00:29:11,099 --> 00:29:19,460
level up. Nice. All right. You've been good. You've been good. I'll turn it on.

154
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:29,220
You've been good. Although I didn't do this. Ooh, the whole crafting system.

155
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:30,579
Actually, let me, let me turn this off for a sec.

156
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:49,579
Got seen. Your mom did a nice job with your hair today. Okay. Okay, dude.

157
00:30:19,829 --> 00:30:54,059
Damn. Constant conflict. And dog.

158
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:30,299
We need to lower check. We actually kind of do. All right. This is great because we actually

159
00:31:30,299 --> 00:31:36,230
really need this. Uh, let me, let me, I need to do something very quickly. Give me one second.

160
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:45,660
I need to. Okay. That's actually all right. Oh, there we go. So make sure that looks all right.

161
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:56,180
I need to make sure my webcam is delayed a little because it will not be synced up with the game.

162
00:31:58,039 --> 00:32:04,089
Now it should be. Hi. Hi there. Uh, where's a good place for the camera? Like up here.

163
00:32:04,089 --> 00:32:11,220
I'll just gonna be tiny camera. And by the way, it's going off unless you're good.

164
00:32:17,609 --> 00:32:24,890
All right. So we got, let's see. Right. Dominant Shiva and Clive's childhood friend

165
00:32:24,890 --> 00:32:30,650
in the depths of the Nysa Defile. The two came to blows at the orders of the armies that enslaved

166
00:32:30,650 --> 00:32:44,259
them. That should be good. Too much. Delay is too much. Really? Shouldn't be. Should match up pretty

167
00:32:44,259 --> 00:32:57,779
well. That's not, that's bad. It's really badly desynced. Wait, what? Really shouldn't be. It's

168
00:32:57,779 --> 00:33:14,680
not even close. How about now? If I go like this. How about now? No? It's by like 500 milliseconds.

169
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:30,150
Well, the face cam's going off. All right. Okay. I remember this. Holy empire. Tiamat is the leader

170
00:33:30,150 --> 00:33:41,990
of the elite assassin squadron to which Wyvern is assigned. The bastards. I'll figure it out at the

171
00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:46,569
break. Or in like 10 minutes. I don't know. Just, just, just hang out. Just chill. I'll fix it.

172
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:55,880
Okay. And this is Branded Soldier. Bears forced to fight for the nations that enslaved them.

173
00:33:55,880 --> 00:34:00,279
Able to cast powerful magics yet entirely disposable. They're often placed on the front

174
00:34:00,279 --> 00:34:09,539
lines in battle or assigned to highly dangerous scouting or assassination missions. All right.

175
00:34:40,469 --> 00:34:55,639
You put the ice queen on her back. No doubt. But you'll have to work harder if you're to claim

176
00:34:55,639 --> 00:35:13,619
this price. My lady, the thunder. We'll be hearing more soon enough. Always worth

177
00:35:13,619 --> 00:35:25,050
fucking snakes it. Gather the men. We have work to do. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. All right.

178
00:35:25,929 --> 00:35:33,349
Yeah. Cause I have to delay my microphone by 800 milliseconds to go with the capture of the

179
00:35:33,349 --> 00:35:39,909
PlayStation 5. So I have to delay my webcam by 800 milliseconds, but apparently that's not matching

180
00:35:39,909 --> 00:36:01,000
up. Why is your setup so bad? It's, it's fine. And who's this fine hound I see before me?

181
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:17,480
A fine hound who saved your life. That's who? Toggle. Hi. His name is Toggle. You two acquainted?

182
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:27,880
Well then, you won't mind taking him off my hands. Funny. I'd always pictured you as more

183
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:40,329
the chocobo type. Clive Rosfield. Can you do this voice? No. Come now. Fleetus flame,

184
00:36:40,409 --> 00:36:45,110
fierce as a wildfire. That there was the blessing of the phoenix.

185
00:36:45,110 --> 00:36:51,219
I'd heard rumors that you'd survived, but I never paid them much heed.

186
00:36:53,269 --> 00:36:59,219
You could definitely do it with filters. And if I drop my pitch down. Calm down. I didn't

187
00:36:59,219 --> 00:37:05,130
come all this way for your handsome mug. Now her on the other hand, she seemed worth muddying my

188
00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:23,260
boots for. None the worse for her. Still might be best to get a second opinion. Crack her up.

189
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:38,389
Who's that? Not another step. I mean it. Well, I'm not about to leave her here.

190
00:37:38,389 --> 00:37:49,190
Not one with a warm bed waiting. It's all right. You're welcome to join us.

191
00:37:50,170 --> 00:37:55,860
You do want to help her, don't you? Lord Shack, we know who these people are.

192
00:37:55,860 --> 00:38:07,190
Sid, if we aren't back soon, Nana will have our heads. I'll explain everything once we're back

193
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:16,809
at the hideaway. Come on. We'll get some more introductions.

194
00:38:16,809 --> 00:38:32,739
You should lore check your microphone and see if the delay can get fixed.

195
00:38:41,369 --> 00:39:03,349
Okay, cool. The hideaway. Don't worry. I will lore check a million more times.

196
00:39:03,349 --> 00:39:14,340
How much further now? But we're in the middle of it.

197
00:39:15,349 --> 00:39:23,219
Keen eye. The blights suck this place dry. Meaning no trees, no birds, and no magic.

198
00:39:24,179 --> 00:39:30,389
But it also means no neighbors. The last place anyone would think to look.

199
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:48,710
That was weird. What just happened in the corner? Are we good? One, two, three, four.

200
00:39:54,809 --> 00:40:00,099
What are you hearing first? Do you hear me and then my movements or do you see movements then

201
00:40:00,099 --> 00:40:08,489
hear me? It's very important. Your audio is coming in a second or two before I move.

202
00:40:09,130 --> 00:40:31,159
Okay, then let's fix it. This place. These are fallen ruins.

203
00:40:31,159 --> 00:40:35,800
Is this better? Two, one, two. And it keeps the black from our lungs.

204
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:44,380
But how do you survive without magic? How does anyone? You must be starving.

205
00:40:45,099 --> 00:40:47,500
We grow them here. Believe it or not.

206
00:40:49,110 --> 00:40:53,530
Suit yourself. You're back.

207
00:40:55,289 --> 00:40:59,130
It's a little bit of a big bite of an apple. This is the dominant.

208
00:40:59,849 --> 00:41:04,010
How cold since we found her? I was hoping you might give her a look over.

209
00:41:05,219 --> 00:41:08,579
All right. Good. Get her upstairs.

210
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:14,900
Don't fret about Karen. I've taken care of her fee.

211
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:18,420
All of it. She's the best healer this side of the belt.

212
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:24,469
You have nothing to worry about. Have a look around.

213
00:41:24,469 --> 00:41:26,710
So do you ever think about getting into voice work?

214
00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:30,789
You should probably say, do you ever think about reading some of the plays that we have

215
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:37,139
in front of an audience? Hide, hide away.

216
00:41:39,769 --> 00:41:42,409
All right. So we get a map. Detail map of your current area.

217
00:41:42,409 --> 00:41:47,539
Main scenario destinations are marked with that. That's a map. Cool.

218
00:41:47,539 --> 00:41:51,429
Oh, and I know exactly. Is it? I know exactly where I need to go.

219
00:41:51,989 --> 00:41:57,980
Oh, I can just mark it too. How are we doing? We all right?

220
00:41:57,980 --> 00:42:09,659
One, two, three. Better. Perfect. Yeah. All right.

221
00:42:09,659 --> 00:42:15,349
And he's a soldier then. Be surprised if he wasn't.

222
00:42:15,349 --> 00:42:28,199
I'd have some around here. Blacksmith?

223
00:42:45,659 --> 00:42:49,099
That is not perfect. I'll get it better.

224
00:42:50,519 --> 00:42:54,599
Is it still are you hearing it still or is it are you hearing me first and then

225
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:57,800
my face moving or is it how is it? How bad is it?

226
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:09,639
It's fine. It's fine. Just working on a pet project of mine.

227
00:43:10,809 --> 00:43:19,510
She's not about biting the hand that feeds you. All right.

228
00:43:20,070 --> 00:43:23,909
I was hoping we might try and solve the mystery of poor Clive Rusfield,

229
00:43:24,469 --> 00:43:29,559
a bearer of the San Brecois Imperial Army sent behind enemy lines

230
00:43:30,599 --> 00:43:35,960
with orders to wait until it turned into a brawl, then slip the dominant throat in the chaos.

231
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:41,639
I didn't know it was her. How could it be?

232
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:46,730
And so to save her neck, you slit your sergeants,

233
00:43:46,730 --> 00:43:52,489
then set your sights on the hills, conveniently forgetting how the Empire deals with deserters.

234
00:43:53,289 --> 00:43:57,369
Because with that on your chop, my friend, we both know you won't be getting far.

235
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:02,710
Without you, I mean, you're going to help me, though. Of course.

236
00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:11,190
You've fallen a long way, Rusfield. You look like a pickle today.

237
00:44:11,909 --> 00:44:30,519
It's fine. A lot of it said that I'm a poor host.

238
00:44:31,079 --> 00:44:34,619
What do you mean to do with her? Do with her?

239
00:44:35,579 --> 00:44:42,860
Why nothing? Her life is her own now. If I wanted to use her, do you think I'd be talking to you?

240
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:48,969
All I want to do is help. Dominance like her. Branded like you.

241
00:44:49,769 --> 00:44:53,849
Of course, the realm doesn't approve, which is why we live in a cave.

242
00:44:54,570 --> 00:45:00,599
I want candles like that. And it's also why we need help

243
00:45:01,239 --> 00:45:04,099
from Branded who know one end of a sword from the other.

244
00:45:07,050 --> 00:45:10,179
What say you, Clive? Will you join us?

245
00:45:23,110 --> 00:45:28,099
Sid, was it? I trust that you'll do right by Joe.

246
00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:35,130
But until my brother is avenged, I must walk my own path.

247
00:45:35,929 --> 00:45:38,650
Avenged?

248
00:45:40,409 --> 00:45:46,179
Are you typing? I'm I'm watching. I'm just I'm asking a quick question.

249
00:45:46,179 --> 00:45:52,380
The phoenix's evil swing. Another room I've proven true.

250
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:56,500
I only stand here today because of Joshua.

251
00:45:57,460 --> 00:46:01,619
13 years I've waited for this chance. I've slept in filth.

252
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:05,219
Junk from a gutter. Killed more men than I can count.

253
00:46:07,079 --> 00:46:11,300
You're right. The Empire will not suffer a deserter.

254
00:46:12,650 --> 00:46:17,659
This will be my best opportunity. My last.

255
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:21,820
Which is why you should join us.

256
00:46:23,099 --> 00:46:24,539
I told you I'm not-

257
00:46:24,539 --> 00:46:25,739
Interested, I know.

258
00:46:30,219 --> 00:46:34,460
One of my scouts sent word there's a group of branded fugitives north of here,

259
00:46:34,460 --> 00:46:36,219
in the Imperial village of Lostwing.

260
00:46:37,340 --> 00:46:40,539
Among them is one he believes to be a dominance of fire.

261
00:46:44,409 --> 00:46:45,130
Is he certain?

262
00:46:48,539 --> 00:46:49,820
What say we go and ask him?

263
00:46:54,619 --> 00:46:56,300
This doesn't mean I'm joining you.

264
00:47:05,929 --> 00:47:06,889
Let's make ready then.

265
00:47:08,170 --> 00:47:15,179
You'll find everything you need down in the main hall, as well as a few things you don't.

266
00:47:15,179 --> 00:47:25,050
Sid's solar. Visit the main hall.

267
00:47:26,469 --> 00:47:27,030
On this way.

268
00:47:27,590 --> 00:47:29,750
I wonder, should I like, buy anything?

269
00:47:31,590 --> 00:47:33,110
How much money do I even have?

270
00:47:33,110 --> 00:47:45,480
Your hair looks red.

271
00:47:59,989 --> 00:48:01,590
This is the full game. Full game came out today.

272
00:48:03,190 --> 00:48:04,710
We picked up at the end of the demo.

273
00:48:08,340 --> 00:48:09,139
On PS5.

274
00:48:11,690 --> 00:48:12,949
To the forge it is then.

275
00:48:13,510 --> 00:48:16,820
Do we actually get to upgrade stuff?

276
00:48:16,820 --> 00:48:19,639
Oh wait, no, hold up. You'll be needing this.

277
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,239
Blackthorn won't take no notice of you otherwise.

278
00:48:24,119 --> 00:48:25,429
Might not anyway.

279
00:48:26,230 --> 00:48:30,469
Somebody said it looks like your room is upside down?

280
00:48:31,269 --> 00:48:32,309
What are you talking about?

281
00:48:41,639 --> 00:48:43,000
My room is not upside down?

282
00:48:45,110 --> 00:48:47,030
Why would I even need to address that?

283
00:48:47,750 --> 00:48:49,750
Of course I'm not, I'm sitting here.

284
00:48:49,750 --> 00:48:53,989
I'm not here to talk.

285
00:48:54,550 --> 00:48:55,750
I'll be accompanying you.

286
00:48:55,750 --> 00:48:59,510
Imagine defending that no, I am not in fact upside down.

287
00:49:01,030 --> 00:49:02,389
How do you even argue that?

288
00:49:02,389 --> 00:49:03,349
For all I care.

289
00:49:03,349 --> 00:49:06,420
Or lifting a finger for you.

290
00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:07,139
Is that so?

291
00:49:08,019 --> 00:49:11,349
Okay.

292
00:49:11,349 --> 00:49:18,170
Some spirit, better suited to stripping oil from a painter's canvas than consumption,

293
00:49:18,170 --> 00:49:22,650
grants overworked conscripts a few rare moments of sweet oblivion

294
00:49:22,650 --> 00:49:26,730
on their long arduous sea journeys north from the continent.

295
00:49:26,730 --> 00:49:29,369
Okay, here, take this.

296
00:49:31,159 --> 00:49:32,360
Do you want that or not?

297
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:34,760
I can take it back.

298
00:49:37,780 --> 00:49:41,079
Damn you, Goots.

299
00:49:41,079 --> 00:49:42,119
All right, all right.

300
00:49:42,119 --> 00:49:43,900
No need to be hasty.

301
00:49:45,670 --> 00:49:46,630
Let's have a look at you.

302
00:49:52,780 --> 00:49:53,420
Drop something?

303
00:49:56,300 --> 00:49:58,460
Everybody just seriously thinks that I'm upside down.

304
00:49:58,460 --> 00:49:59,420
I'm going to let this go.

305
00:50:02,980 --> 00:50:06,260
I'll do what I can as a favor to Goot's mind.

306
00:50:12,889 --> 00:50:14,170
We could barely see that.

307
00:50:14,730 --> 00:50:17,210
It's hard when you're in a little cube over here.

308
00:50:17,849 --> 00:50:20,010
There, I have to match it up that way.

309
00:50:20,010 --> 00:50:20,730
Okay.

310
00:50:20,730 --> 00:50:24,860
The crafting of new gear as well as the upgrading of existing gear

311
00:50:24,860 --> 00:50:28,099
can be done at a blacksmith.

312
00:50:28,099 --> 00:50:31,320
As long as you have the recipe and the proper materials.

313
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:35,000
Select a highlighted item from the list and hold X to craft or upgrade.

314
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:39,340
Looks like I can upgrade my iron belt.

315
00:50:39,340 --> 00:50:47,900
Okay.

316
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:49,579
Okay.

317
00:50:49,579 --> 00:50:50,860
Fine, I'll stop vibing.

318
00:50:50,860 --> 00:50:52,139
I'll stop vibing then.

319
00:50:52,139 --> 00:50:52,460
Fine.

320
00:50:53,019 --> 00:50:55,579
Okay.

321
00:50:55,579 --> 00:50:58,679
Iron belt.

322
00:50:58,679 --> 00:50:59,320
I can also read.

323
00:50:59,320 --> 00:50:59,960
There's nothing to read for.

324
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:00,519
Sorry, I could do...

325
00:51:01,159 --> 00:51:02,599
Okay.

326
00:51:02,599 --> 00:51:03,159
Let's see.

327
00:51:03,159 --> 00:51:04,039
It wants me to do it.

328
00:51:04,679 --> 00:51:09,539
And the belt sees a square.

329
00:51:09,539 --> 00:51:13,110
You want anything else, you bring your own materials.

330
00:51:13,750 --> 00:51:14,789
I'll bear that in mind.

331
00:51:16,199 --> 00:51:16,679
Thank you.

332
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:20,920
A word of advice.

333
00:51:21,559 --> 00:51:23,400
Don't let Sid decide what's best for you.

334
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:30,840
Notices when something has changed in the hideaway,

335
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:33,480
a notice will appear in the upper right-hand corner of the screen.

336
00:51:34,119 --> 00:51:38,500
In addition to stock updates for Charon's Toll

337
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:41,219
and new forging recipes for the Black Hammer,

338
00:51:41,219 --> 00:51:42,739
there are also notices for new quests,

339
00:51:42,739 --> 00:51:44,980
new missions, and many other things.

340
00:51:45,539 --> 00:51:47,940
A icon will appear in-game

341
00:51:47,940 --> 00:51:49,860
as well as on the local map to indicate recent updates.

342
00:51:49,860 --> 00:51:50,980
Sorry, it's a little like side thing.

343
00:51:50,980 --> 00:51:51,860
I suppose I should think it...

344
00:51:51,860 --> 00:51:52,260
Updates.

345
00:51:54,579 --> 00:51:56,500
A new crafting recipe is available at the...

346
00:51:56,500 --> 00:51:57,219
Okay.

347
00:51:57,219 --> 00:51:57,940
Let's just see what it is.

348
00:51:58,739 --> 00:51:59,699
I see I'm busy here.

349
00:52:00,579 --> 00:52:02,300
I'm a Sanfordian, dear.

350
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:07,590
Broad sword.

351
00:52:07,590 --> 00:52:10,150
I need three Y-rite.

352
00:52:10,150 --> 00:52:13,750
I could do iron bracers.

353
00:52:14,309 --> 00:52:21,429
What do I have right now?

354
00:52:21,989 --> 00:52:23,510
I'm wearing the broadsword right now.

355
00:52:23,510 --> 00:52:25,260
Broad sword plus one.

356
00:52:25,900 --> 00:52:27,380
No, I actually don't.

357
00:52:27,380 --> 00:52:28,179
What do I have right now?

358
00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:30,500
Why did I do this with my voice?

359
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:31,960
All right.

360
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:32,440
I can...

361
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:34,440
Should I make some bracers?

362
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:46,920
I could.

363
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:47,400
Why not?

364
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:47,880
Say...

365
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:48,119
Yeah.

366
00:52:48,119 --> 00:52:48,280
Wait.

367
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:49,320
Oh, this uses a Y-rite.

368
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:49,960
I'll save for the sword.

369
00:52:51,829 --> 00:52:52,710
I want damage.

370
00:52:53,349 --> 00:52:56,380
All right.

371
00:52:56,380 --> 00:52:58,619
So what else is unlocked here?

372
00:52:58,619 --> 00:52:59,980
The fat chocobo.

373
00:52:59,980 --> 00:53:01,500
Well, I'm going to see that.

374
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:06,840
There's no way I'm not going to go investigate that.

375
00:53:13,619 --> 00:53:13,860
All right.

376
00:53:13,860 --> 00:53:15,059
Where's this fat chocobo?

377
00:53:15,059 --> 00:53:16,579
Oh, that's the name of the restaurant.

378
00:53:17,139 --> 00:53:27,239
I thought there was going to be like a big chocobo in here.

379
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:31,079
Can I eat something?

380
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:39,719
Auto.

381
00:53:43,099 --> 00:53:43,340
All right.

382
00:53:43,340 --> 00:53:43,900
Well, let's just go.

383
00:53:46,010 --> 00:53:56,650
The gift worked.

384
00:53:57,690 --> 00:53:58,570
You have my thanks.

385
00:53:58,570 --> 00:54:01,289
Your face game doesn't line up with the header in the game,

386
00:54:01,289 --> 00:54:02,889
and it's torturing me.

387
00:54:02,889 --> 00:54:03,769
Come on.

388
00:54:03,769 --> 00:54:04,409
Nearly there.

389
00:54:24,059 --> 00:54:24,699
You.

390
00:54:24,699 --> 00:54:25,340
Blankets.

391
00:54:25,340 --> 00:54:26,059
Quick as you like.

392
00:54:38,309 --> 00:54:39,269
All right.

393
00:54:39,269 --> 00:54:41,510
We're making comfortable while a bed's made up.

394
00:54:41,510 --> 00:54:42,789
Can you guys test the command?

395
00:54:42,789 --> 00:54:44,710
Can you guys do exclamation FF16?

396
00:54:44,710 --> 00:54:45,829
I'm just going to stand there.

397
00:54:45,829 --> 00:54:47,030
Someone face some water.

398
00:54:47,590 --> 00:54:48,710
I'll get the bucket.

399
00:54:49,590 --> 00:54:51,510
You can't see if what I need's out.

400
00:54:52,789 --> 00:54:54,710
Oh, wait, me.

401
00:54:56,139 --> 00:55:00,090
Well, not all of you at the same time, but it could be working.

402
00:55:00,949 --> 00:55:01,510
Is it working?

403
00:55:02,070 --> 00:55:04,940
What the hell have I got myself into?

404
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:21,559
Nurseries in 864 P.

405
00:55:21,559 --> 00:55:22,119
Who are they?

406
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:24,340
It's got a 30 second cooldown.

407
00:55:25,940 --> 00:55:28,019
They're freed imperial bearers.

408
00:55:28,019 --> 00:55:28,820
Who the hell are you?

409
00:55:32,630 --> 00:55:34,869
Shit, at this rate, you won't make it through the night.

410
00:55:35,590 --> 00:55:38,550
Then you can find your way up them stairs to the infirmary.

411
00:55:38,550 --> 00:55:39,429
We need Taya.

412
00:55:40,070 --> 00:55:40,710
Well, go on.

413
00:55:41,429 --> 00:55:42,230
Shift your arse.

414
00:55:43,110 --> 00:55:48,599
Let's tell you the one looking after Jill.

415
00:55:49,719 --> 00:55:50,039
All right.

416
00:55:50,039 --> 00:55:52,280
Speak with Taya in the infirmary.

417
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:57,380
What's all the commotion?

418
00:55:57,380 --> 00:55:58,579
I think we should go and help.

419
00:55:58,579 --> 00:56:01,780
It sounds like we've got some new customers.

420
00:56:01,780 --> 00:56:02,260
Auto.

421
00:56:04,380 --> 00:56:06,699
R1, R1, R1, R1, R1.

422
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:15,800
Your friend needs her rest.

423
00:56:16,519 --> 00:56:19,880
There'll be time for tearful reunions once she's recovered.

424
00:56:20,519 --> 00:56:21,400
I'm not here for Jill.

425
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:23,480
You're wanted downstairs.

426
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:25,079
There are injured bearers in need of attention.

427
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:27,159
Well, why didn't you say so?

428
00:56:28,860 --> 00:56:31,019
Can you explain the lore of the last 16 games?

429
00:56:31,019 --> 00:56:33,909
Well, that's the beauty of Final Fantasy.

430
00:56:33,909 --> 00:56:35,269
You don't need to know anything

431
00:56:35,269 --> 00:56:36,630
about the other Final Fantasy games.

432
00:56:36,630 --> 00:56:38,949
You could start at Final Fantasy 16

433
00:56:38,949 --> 00:56:42,679
and you are golden with its own story.

434
00:56:42,679 --> 00:56:44,539
You don't need to know anything

435
00:56:44,539 --> 00:56:45,900
about any of the Final Fantasies.

436
00:56:45,900 --> 00:56:47,260
It's a perfect place to start.

437
00:56:52,019 --> 00:56:53,380
He's going to be all right.

438
00:56:53,380 --> 00:56:53,780
Thank you.

439
00:56:53,780 --> 00:56:55,940
But I'll need to examine them both in the infirmary.

440
00:56:58,860 --> 00:57:00,059
Yeah, but nobody said that.

441
00:57:00,059 --> 00:57:00,539
Yeah, they did.

442
00:57:00,539 --> 00:57:01,260
They just asked it.

443
00:57:19,099 --> 00:57:21,019
Another fond day of the Heideweide.

444
00:57:21,019 --> 00:57:24,230
To many of the bearers who come here arrive in this state.

445
00:57:24,949 --> 00:57:26,309
It's no easy thing.

446
00:57:26,309 --> 00:57:27,429
Cast me off your chains.

447
00:57:28,710 --> 00:57:30,389
By the time most pluck up the courage,

448
00:57:30,949 --> 00:57:31,989
they're all too far gone.

449
00:57:31,989 --> 00:57:33,190
Can we get a lore check?

450
00:57:33,909 --> 00:57:35,349
These two here are the lucky ones.

451
00:57:47,349 --> 00:57:52,820
Sedolphus Telemann, cornered by a battalion of iron kingdom crusaders

452
00:57:52,820 --> 00:57:58,019
in the depths of the Nysa Defile, Clive thought his end was nigh,

453
00:57:58,019 --> 00:58:00,820
until Cid appeared and spirited him and Jill away

454
00:58:00,820 --> 00:58:02,500
to his secret hideaway in the Deadlands.

455
00:58:04,010 --> 00:58:05,289
Pretty fucking sick.

456
00:58:05,929 --> 00:58:08,150
The name's Otto.

457
00:58:08,789 --> 00:58:09,590
You need anything?

458
00:58:10,230 --> 00:58:10,869
You asked me.

459
00:58:11,590 --> 00:58:14,150
Well, Otto, I do need some supplies.

460
00:58:14,949 --> 00:58:15,670
Do you now?

461
00:58:16,789 --> 00:58:20,309
Then Lady Karen over there will be more than happy to help.

462
00:58:20,309 --> 00:58:21,190
Can buy some stuff.

463
00:58:21,829 --> 00:58:22,150
Right.

464
00:58:24,309 --> 00:58:26,619
Oh, and thanks.

465
00:58:27,510 --> 00:58:28,230
Be seeing you.

466
00:58:28,869 --> 00:58:29,510
Not likely.

467
00:58:30,389 --> 00:58:31,190
I won't be staying.

468
00:58:31,909 --> 00:58:32,550
Is that right?

469
00:58:33,940 --> 00:58:35,539
Well, for as long as you are.

470
00:58:35,539 --> 00:58:37,619
This guy does not sound like Otto.

471
00:58:38,579 --> 00:58:39,619
You helped us today.

472
00:58:40,579 --> 00:58:41,619
And we won't forget it.

473
00:58:42,340 --> 00:58:44,420
You have to stay and we won't forget it.

474
00:58:44,420 --> 00:58:44,820
Thank you.

475
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:48,119
It's a pleasure to do business with you.

476
00:58:48,119 --> 00:58:48,920
My name's Otto.

477
00:58:50,179 --> 00:58:51,059
Yeah, you're right.

478
00:58:51,059 --> 00:58:52,179
Doesn't sound the same.

479
00:58:54,059 --> 00:58:56,949
Side quests have been unlocked.

480
00:58:56,949 --> 00:58:59,750
So green icons are side quests.

481
00:59:03,829 --> 00:59:07,429
After accepting quest, quest objectives appear in the to-do list.

482
00:59:07,429 --> 00:59:07,849
Okay.

483
00:59:08,969 --> 00:59:13,130
Red is a main scenario and then you can have up to three green side quests.

484
00:59:14,099 --> 00:59:15,699
Any quest can be prioritized.

485
00:59:16,980 --> 00:59:17,619
Right.

486
00:59:17,619 --> 00:59:21,059
Okay.

487
00:59:23,159 --> 00:59:24,840
The Thousand Tomes.

488
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:26,119
An ever-growing compendium.

489
00:59:26,119 --> 00:59:27,559
All things Velystia.

490
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:30,119
The Orchestrion.

491
00:59:30,119 --> 00:59:32,039
Jukebox for all the songs collected through the game.

492
00:59:32,039 --> 00:59:32,280
Cool.

493
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:34,760
They're in the Fat Chocobo.

494
00:59:34,760 --> 00:59:35,960
Who are these people?

495
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:36,599
Oh, all right.

496
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:41,909
Does anybody want the little M&M crunchies in my ice cream?

497
00:59:41,909 --> 00:59:43,110
I kind of just want the ice cream.

498
00:59:47,019 --> 00:59:48,780
You don't want the M&M's in the ice cream?

499
00:59:48,780 --> 00:59:49,579
What do you mean?

500
00:59:49,579 --> 00:59:50,860
You eat around the M&M's?

501
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:52,199
That's...

502
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:53,239
Really?

503
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:55,300
It's like the best part.

504
00:59:56,019 --> 00:59:59,849
I need supplies for my journey to Lostwing.

505
01:00:00,489 --> 01:00:01,429
I'm talking...

506
01:00:01,429 --> 01:00:02,230
What else can you provide them?

507
01:00:02,869 --> 01:00:03,510
What's that?

508
01:00:04,550 --> 01:00:07,269
Does the newcomer think it proper to make demands

509
01:00:07,269 --> 01:00:10,869
of a poor old matron before even introducing himself?

510
01:00:12,630 --> 01:00:13,510
It's Clive.

511
01:00:13,510 --> 01:00:14,389
M&M's are gross?

512
01:00:14,389 --> 01:00:15,829
No, Clive.

513
01:00:15,829 --> 01:00:17,349
M&M's are gross by themselves.

514
01:00:17,349 --> 01:00:17,909
I hear that dog is yours.

515
01:00:17,909 --> 01:00:20,309
They're amazing in other baked goods or ice creams.

516
01:00:20,309 --> 01:00:22,550
Since he found Sidon one night, I've seen to it that his

517
01:00:22,550 --> 01:00:24,389
chin's rubbed and his belly fed.

518
01:00:25,110 --> 01:00:26,949
Though I suppose that's your job now.

519
01:00:28,219 --> 01:00:29,900
Unless you lose him again.

520
01:00:29,900 --> 01:00:30,780
M&M's and cookies?

521
01:00:30,780 --> 01:00:31,099
I won't.

522
01:00:31,099 --> 01:00:31,820
S tier.

523
01:00:31,820 --> 01:00:33,260
M&M's and ice cream?

524
01:00:33,260 --> 01:00:33,340
Not again.

525
01:00:33,340 --> 01:00:34,219
S tier.

526
01:00:34,219 --> 01:00:35,099
Handful of M&M's?

527
01:00:35,099 --> 01:00:36,380
Thank you for watching him.

528
01:00:36,380 --> 01:00:36,880
C.

529
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:39,500
So, were you gonna buy something?

530
01:00:40,059 --> 01:00:40,940
C plus maybe.

531
01:00:41,579 --> 01:00:44,780
You didn't think I'd shower your lordship with my hard-won wares

532
01:00:44,780 --> 01:00:47,340
while you swagger about with a pocketful of gil?

533
01:00:48,300 --> 01:00:50,300
Life doesn't work that way, lad.

534
01:00:51,099 --> 01:00:53,909
Now, let's see some coin.

535
01:00:56,489 --> 01:00:57,369
All right.

536
01:01:00,570 --> 01:01:02,570
Shop stock changes as the story progresses,

537
01:01:02,570 --> 01:01:03,690
so be sure to check frequently.

538
01:01:04,699 --> 01:01:05,980
So, I can buy a broad-

539
01:01:05,980 --> 01:01:07,659
Wait, I can buy a broadsword?

540
01:01:07,659 --> 01:01:08,699
I'm gonna buy a broadsword,

541
01:01:08,699 --> 01:01:10,619
then I'm gonna take it over and upgrade the broadsword.

542
01:01:10,619 --> 01:01:14,809
How many I f-

543
01:01:14,809 --> 01:01:15,130
Four.

544
01:01:15,130 --> 01:01:15,849
I'll get another one of these.

545
01:01:16,730 --> 01:01:17,449
Wait, how much-

546
01:01:17,449 --> 01:01:18,329
That's 200!

547
01:01:19,050 --> 01:01:22,809
It's 500 bucks for the broadsword,

548
01:01:22,809 --> 01:01:24,969
and it's 200 for potion?

549
01:01:25,530 --> 01:01:29,699
Seems like a lot.

550
01:01:29,699 --> 01:01:30,019
All right.

551
01:01:30,739 --> 01:01:31,699
I'm getting the broadsword.

552
01:01:36,059 --> 01:01:37,019
Yeah, I'm gonna-

553
01:01:37,019 --> 01:01:37,820
I'm gonna go upgrade it.

554
01:01:39,340 --> 01:01:41,019
You're robbing me blind, you know.

555
01:01:41,659 --> 01:01:44,090
Just don't get hit.

556
01:01:44,090 --> 01:01:44,570
I'll be fine.

557
01:01:45,210 --> 01:01:46,710
That's all.

558
01:01:46,710 --> 01:01:50,250
Why, you're barely a girl to your name.

559
01:01:50,250 --> 01:01:50,889
Just don't get hit.

560
01:01:51,530 --> 01:01:56,460
You're taking his side now.

561
01:01:57,739 --> 01:01:59,900
And after all I've done for you.

562
01:02:02,139 --> 01:02:02,860
All right.

563
01:02:04,250 --> 01:02:04,969
All right.

564
01:02:04,969 --> 01:02:06,489
I can make an exception.

565
01:02:09,030 --> 01:02:10,789
But just this once, mind.

566
01:02:11,429 --> 01:02:12,869
Me stores are getting cluttered,

567
01:02:12,869 --> 01:02:14,869
and I need to make room for the next shipment.

568
01:02:17,449 --> 01:02:17,929
You're-

569
01:02:17,929 --> 01:02:18,730
You're broke now?

570
01:02:18,730 --> 01:02:21,210
Thank you.

571
01:02:21,210 --> 01:02:21,849
Thank me?

572
01:02:23,769 --> 01:02:24,730
Thank your dog.

573
01:02:25,369 --> 01:02:29,480
Wha- wha- wha- wha- wha- wha- wha- wha- wha- wha-

574
01:02:29,480 --> 01:02:30,599
What button do I press to get off?

575
01:02:30,599 --> 01:02:31,079
Camera.

576
01:02:31,079 --> 01:02:31,400
That one.

577
01:02:46,250 --> 01:02:46,570
All right.

578
01:02:46,570 --> 01:02:47,610
Collect the supplies.

579
01:02:47,610 --> 01:02:49,769
Wait, did I just buy a broadsword for no reason?

580
01:02:52,489 --> 01:02:54,730
I swear to God there's a broadsword in one of these sacks.

581
01:02:54,730 --> 01:02:55,530
I'm gonna be pissed off.

582
01:03:05,019 --> 01:03:07,340
Virtual Battlescape provides Clive a safe location

583
01:03:07,340 --> 01:03:08,699
to test out new abilities

584
01:03:08,699 --> 01:03:10,539
and train against all manner of enemies.

585
01:03:12,119 --> 01:03:14,199
Oh, it's like a little training zone.

586
01:03:14,199 --> 01:03:15,000
All of virtue.

587
01:03:17,239 --> 01:03:17,719
That's cool.

588
01:03:18,659 --> 01:03:19,619
I guess it wants me to do it.

589
01:03:20,940 --> 01:03:21,659
Do I?

590
01:03:21,659 --> 01:03:22,940
Yeah, I guess it's like go do it.

591
01:03:29,860 --> 01:03:30,739
I'm telling you, I'm gonna-

592
01:03:30,739 --> 01:03:31,300
I'm gonna be-

593
01:03:31,300 --> 01:03:34,019
I'm gonna be the guy that has the big bump on the-

594
01:03:34,019 --> 01:03:35,059
on like the- the uh-

595
01:03:35,780 --> 01:03:37,539
the official source of this music.

596
01:03:38,840 --> 01:03:40,679
I- I'll be the bump on YouTube, you know what I mean?

597
01:03:41,239 --> 01:03:50,710
Okay.

598
01:03:50,710 --> 01:03:51,349
Ooh!

599
01:03:51,349 --> 01:03:52,710
Wait, you can see what I do over here!

600
01:03:52,710 --> 01:03:53,510
That's kind of- I don't like-

601
01:03:54,070 --> 01:03:54,630
That's weird.

602
01:03:54,630 --> 01:03:56,230
You guys are gonna try to judge my movements.

603
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:02,119
The YouTube video hump.

604
01:04:02,119 --> 01:04:03,480
That's what I'm talking about.

605
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:06,460
The thing that says the most replayed part of the video.

606
01:04:06,460 --> 01:04:07,500
I'm gonna contribute to that.

607
01:04:07,500 --> 01:04:08,219
It's gonna be bad.

608
01:04:09,340 --> 01:04:30,579
Why does he move so weird?

609
01:04:30,579 --> 01:04:31,940
I'm just fucking around.

610
01:04:34,900 --> 01:04:36,260
All right, this is really cool.

611
01:04:36,260 --> 01:04:37,940
So I can do invincibility.

612
01:04:37,940 --> 01:04:39,059
I can do an action log.

613
01:04:39,059 --> 01:04:42,010
I can do enemy invincibility.

614
01:04:42,010 --> 01:04:43,530
I can probably change the tar-

615
01:04:43,530 --> 01:04:44,090
Yeah, all right.

616
01:04:44,090 --> 01:04:44,650
That's cool.

617
01:04:47,449 --> 01:04:47,929
So I can-

618
01:04:48,489 --> 01:04:50,250
Oh, you can practice against bosses?

619
01:04:50,250 --> 01:04:50,969
Is that how that works?

620
01:05:05,420 --> 01:05:07,019
So not attacking currently.

621
01:05:07,659 --> 01:05:13,059
Oh, enemy aggro.

622
01:05:13,059 --> 01:05:13,539
Here we go.

623
01:05:15,449 --> 01:05:15,929
Interesting.

624
01:05:16,650 --> 01:05:23,800
It's a good place to practice dodging.

625
01:05:25,719 --> 01:05:35,159
Ow!

626
01:05:36,650 --> 01:05:37,289
All right, cool.

627
01:05:37,849 --> 01:05:39,849
I might practice here with some encounters.

628
01:05:40,489 --> 01:05:54,619
The person really wants me to know that they ate a bunch of bread.

629
01:06:02,869 --> 01:06:04,710
Even already, are ya?

630
01:06:05,269 --> 01:06:08,949
It's you I'll miss the most, Lady Karen.

631
01:06:08,949 --> 01:06:10,230
It always is.

632
01:06:10,230 --> 01:06:11,989
Doesn't stop you going, does it?

633
01:06:13,980 --> 01:06:14,780
This should be fun.

634
01:06:19,019 --> 01:06:20,460
When's the BLT stream?

635
01:06:22,139 --> 01:06:22,639
Soon.

636
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:36,440
There's fast travel.

637
01:06:36,440 --> 01:06:37,400
You use the world map.

638
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:39,239
Instant travel between unlocked locations.

639
01:06:40,780 --> 01:06:43,019
New locations are unlocked by progressing through the main story

640
01:06:43,019 --> 01:06:48,679
or discovering waymarks known as obelisks.

641
01:06:48,679 --> 01:06:51,559
World map up and automatically upon leaving an area.

642
01:06:51,559 --> 01:06:51,880
What?

643
01:06:51,880 --> 01:06:53,000
That was a weird way to say that.

644
01:06:54,250 --> 01:06:57,210
All right, collect the supplies, which were right here.

645
01:06:57,769 --> 01:06:59,500
Come on, get us off.

646
01:07:00,139 --> 01:07:01,610
Clear this.

647
01:07:01,610 --> 01:07:05,340
There we go.

648
01:07:05,340 --> 01:07:06,699
Make for the Great Wood.

649
01:07:13,130 --> 01:07:14,389
Oh, world map.

650
01:07:14,389 --> 01:07:14,949
There it is.

651
01:07:14,949 --> 01:07:15,670
Which button is that?

652
01:07:18,039 --> 01:07:18,539
Ah.

653
01:07:22,949 --> 01:07:23,449
Okay.

654
01:07:24,730 --> 01:07:25,610
We're going over here.

655
01:07:25,610 --> 01:07:26,409
The Great Wood.

656
01:07:27,050 --> 01:07:28,570
So deep and vast as the Great Wood,

657
01:07:28,570 --> 01:07:32,010
it serves as a defensive barrier between the Crystal Belt and the Holy Empire.

658
01:07:32,969 --> 01:07:35,530
Are you gonna finish the game?

659
01:07:36,420 --> 01:07:39,619
I, streaming-wise, if you guys continue to like it,

660
01:07:39,619 --> 01:07:41,619
I mean, I'm invested.

661
01:07:42,340 --> 01:07:44,170
I might finish it on my own time,

662
01:07:44,170 --> 01:07:46,969
like just kind of hanging out on the couch or maybe I'll play it here.

663
01:07:46,969 --> 01:07:47,289
I don't know.

664
01:07:47,289 --> 01:07:47,610
We'll see.

665
01:07:47,610 --> 01:07:50,090
We'll see how you guys feel because I'm into it.

666
01:08:16,600 --> 01:08:24,329
When are you gonna do a live audience stream so we can throw tomatoes at you?

667
01:08:34,470 --> 01:08:37,670
There we go.

668
01:08:37,670 --> 01:08:38,789
So here's the party.

669
01:08:38,789 --> 01:08:39,619
Let's go.

670
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:50,810
That sound is huge.

671
01:08:54,329 --> 01:08:54,829
I suppose not.

672
01:08:57,479 --> 01:08:57,979
Okay.

673
01:08:58,680 --> 01:08:59,800
Banning embers.

674
01:09:03,369 --> 01:09:06,409
Torgl has joined the party and will fight alongside Clive.

675
01:09:07,609 --> 01:09:14,710
So use the d-pad to talk between item shortcuts and pet commands.

676
01:09:14,710 --> 01:09:19,640
Attack, heal, and launch an enemy into the air.

677
01:09:20,819 --> 01:09:21,319
Oh.

678
01:09:21,699 --> 01:09:24,310
So I gotta go boom and then up.

679
01:09:25,109 --> 01:09:31,029
The accessory known as the Ring of Timely Assistance removes the need for giving Torgl commands.

680
01:09:31,029 --> 01:09:31,989
When this item is equipped,

681
01:09:31,989 --> 01:09:35,750
Torgl will attack and heal automatically based on the current battle situation.

682
01:09:35,750 --> 01:09:37,590
Did I mention there'd be deadly beasts?

683
01:09:37,590 --> 01:09:38,630
I don't need to put that on.

684
01:09:38,630 --> 01:09:39,750
There'll be deadly beasts.

685
01:09:40,470 --> 01:09:42,149
Nothing a trained assassin can't handle.

686
01:09:43,029 --> 01:09:43,989
How reassuring.

687
01:09:45,050 --> 01:09:45,449
You're welcome.

688
01:09:45,449 --> 01:09:46,409
It's very pretty.

689
01:09:46,409 --> 01:09:48,090
For that and his shortcut.

690
01:10:02,550 --> 01:10:03,109
Can you walk?

691
01:10:04,140 --> 01:10:04,699
Walk, walk.

692
01:10:05,739 --> 01:10:06,380
I'm walking.

693
01:10:20,340 --> 01:10:21,060
I don't think so.

694
01:10:32,420 --> 01:10:33,460
I thought he was on the ground.

695
01:10:33,460 --> 01:10:34,180
I was like, oh shit.

696
01:10:34,180 --> 01:10:34,979
Sid's like dead.

697
01:10:36,100 --> 01:10:46,279
Where is Torgl?

698
01:10:46,840 --> 01:10:48,140
Oh, he's already up there.

699
01:10:49,500 --> 01:10:59,319
I want to upgrade this.

700
01:11:00,039 --> 01:11:03,420
I like the magic.

701
01:11:04,619 --> 01:11:07,670
Is this for sponsorship?

702
01:11:07,670 --> 01:11:08,229
This is.

703
01:11:09,029 --> 01:11:10,340
This is sponsored by...

704
01:11:10,340 --> 01:11:12,260
The stream is sponsored by Square Enix.

705
01:11:12,260 --> 01:11:17,159
Come on, Thanos 16.

706
01:11:17,159 --> 01:11:24,329
What do you think of the PS5?

707
01:11:27,109 --> 01:11:27,609
It's...

708
01:11:30,119 --> 01:11:33,880
So I use consoles as like a complete multimedia box.

709
01:11:35,529 --> 01:11:37,850
And PS5 seems pretty great for...

710
01:11:37,850 --> 01:11:38,649
Hold on a minute.

711
01:11:39,850 --> 01:11:40,409
Wait a minute.

712
01:11:41,050 --> 01:11:41,689
He hates it.

713
01:11:41,689 --> 01:11:44,250
I just thought I'm about to explain to you why I like it so much.

714
01:11:44,810 --> 01:11:50,329
I didn't even like say two sentences.

715
01:11:50,329 --> 01:11:53,369
What in good Grieger's name is he doing this far south?

716
01:11:55,350 --> 01:11:56,630
Looking for food.

717
01:11:56,630 --> 01:11:58,310
No more wolves where he's from.

718
01:11:58,310 --> 01:12:01,350
The north was one of the first parts of storm to fall to the blight.

719
01:12:02,229 --> 01:12:04,819
Oh sod.

720
01:12:05,460 --> 01:12:08,260
I'd invite him over for a cup of tea if I didn't think he'd eat the dog.

721
01:12:16,329 --> 01:12:19,449
You said on August 2nd there'd be a bald cam for your birthday.

722
01:12:19,449 --> 01:12:22,090
I'll just put my head down and you can laugh for five seconds.

723
01:12:22,090 --> 01:12:23,770
Let's try and stay out of its path.

724
01:12:24,409 --> 01:12:25,529
Okay, stay away from that.

725
01:12:41,979 --> 01:12:59,770
Oh, I have the charge move too, don't I?

726
01:12:59,770 --> 01:13:00,890
This one here.

727
01:13:00,890 --> 01:13:04,310
Here we go.

728
01:13:04,310 --> 01:13:08,550
Down.

729
01:13:08,550 --> 01:13:13,460
Ooh, level up.

730
01:13:18,060 --> 01:13:19,020
Eleven Gil.

731
01:13:19,020 --> 01:13:20,300
Is it Gil or Jill?

732
01:13:21,020 --> 01:13:21,520
Gil?

733
01:13:22,140 --> 01:13:31,850
Oh, I got...

734
01:13:31,850 --> 01:13:32,649
Why right?

735
01:13:32,649 --> 01:13:34,409
Maybe that's enough to upgrade the broadsword.

736
01:13:34,409 --> 01:13:35,289
Do I even have the broadsword?

737
01:13:35,289 --> 01:13:36,090
I have it equipped, right?

738
01:13:36,090 --> 01:13:36,890
Yeah.

739
01:13:36,890 --> 01:13:44,760
After you.

740
01:13:44,760 --> 01:13:45,319
It's strong.

741
01:13:45,960 --> 01:13:47,079
Thank you kindly.

742
01:13:55,800 --> 01:13:57,239
Like, Gil?

743
01:13:57,960 --> 01:14:04,170
The ruins.

744
01:14:04,810 --> 01:14:12,739
They're everywhere, aren't they?

745
01:14:12,739 --> 01:14:15,140
Some say there was a time they blocked out the stars.

746
01:14:16,649 --> 01:14:18,409
Down was the only way for them to go.

747
01:14:18,409 --> 01:14:19,609
Do I not have the broadsword equipped?

748
01:14:20,250 --> 01:14:22,329
There's probably a lesson to be learned from that.

749
01:14:23,130 --> 01:14:24,329
But it can wait.

750
01:14:24,329 --> 01:14:25,050
Come on.

751
01:14:25,050 --> 01:14:26,760
I'll check.

752
01:14:26,760 --> 01:14:28,760
Actually, I have points to spend too in the abilities.

753
01:14:38,760 --> 01:14:39,720
What do I want to focus on?

754
01:14:42,039 --> 01:14:43,319
Journal tab has information.

755
01:14:43,880 --> 01:14:44,359
All right.

756
01:14:44,359 --> 01:14:45,079
What I want to see...

757
01:14:46,619 --> 01:14:47,180
Items.

758
01:14:47,739 --> 01:14:52,699
You can assign shortcuts.

759
01:14:52,699 --> 01:14:53,199
Uh-huh.

760
01:14:53,979 --> 01:14:55,659
I think the shortcuts are fine.

761
01:14:56,380 --> 01:14:57,350
What is...

762
01:14:57,350 --> 01:14:59,430
Wait, I want the strength one, I think.

763
01:15:00,899 --> 01:15:02,340
Increases attack bar by 10%.

764
01:15:02,340 --> 01:15:03,699
Yeah, let's put this down here.

765
01:15:03,699 --> 01:15:09,880
Just don't get hit and just do more damage.

766
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:10,600
That sounds good to me.

767
01:15:14,470 --> 01:15:14,949
All right.

768
01:15:15,689 --> 01:15:17,130
Gear and icons.

769
01:15:21,369 --> 01:15:22,170
They have these.

770
01:15:22,170 --> 01:15:23,369
I don't think I unlocked anything new.

771
01:15:23,369 --> 01:15:23,609
No.

772
01:15:23,609 --> 01:15:23,850
All right.

773
01:15:23,850 --> 01:15:24,409
Abilities.

774
01:15:24,409 --> 01:15:24,890
Here we go.

775
01:15:24,890 --> 01:15:25,050
All right.

776
01:15:25,050 --> 01:15:25,689
What do I got?

777
01:15:25,689 --> 01:15:26,489
115?

778
01:15:27,210 --> 01:15:35,850
Should I upgrade Scarlet Cyclone?

779
01:15:36,649 --> 01:15:37,770
Probably should get all these first.

780
01:15:38,329 --> 01:15:39,130
Magic Burst?

781
01:15:39,130 --> 01:15:40,569
Oh, actually, I use this all the time.

782
01:15:41,289 --> 01:15:42,329
I use this all the time.

783
01:15:42,970 --> 01:15:47,100
This is my move.

784
01:15:51,989 --> 01:15:52,869
It's either that or...

785
01:15:53,590 --> 01:15:56,760
I'm doing it.

786
01:15:58,010 --> 01:15:58,729
This is my move.

787
01:15:59,859 --> 01:16:00,739
You see me do it a lot.

788
01:16:01,380 --> 01:16:02,500
All right.

789
01:16:02,500 --> 01:16:03,060
Now I'm gonna...

790
01:16:04,600 --> 01:16:05,159
I'll get this.

791
01:16:06,279 --> 01:16:08,039
Put this well in the air to slice down.

792
01:16:08,760 --> 01:16:12,859
Cool.

793
01:16:12,859 --> 01:16:13,260
Taunt?

794
01:16:13,819 --> 01:16:18,520
R2 plus that button to pull an enemy?

795
01:16:21,640 --> 01:16:22,439
Swift Recovery.

796
01:16:23,239 --> 01:16:23,960
That's important.

797
01:16:28,550 --> 01:16:28,949
Stomp.

798
01:16:29,510 --> 01:16:32,949
Kick off a nearby enemy, increasing jump height.

799
01:16:32,949 --> 01:16:33,270
Yeah.

800
01:16:33,270 --> 01:16:34,470
I mean, just all the cheap ones.

801
01:16:34,470 --> 01:16:35,270
I'll just get them all.

802
01:16:35,989 --> 01:16:40,090
Okay.

803
01:16:40,090 --> 01:16:40,569
Cool.

804
01:16:40,569 --> 01:16:45,699
Do you believe in dolphins?

805
01:16:46,420 --> 01:16:48,899
Do you mean, do I believe that the animal, the dolphins, exist?

806
01:16:49,619 --> 01:16:52,979
Or do I believe that the dolphins will win the Super Bowl eventually?

807
01:16:52,979 --> 01:16:53,460
What do you mean?

808
01:16:54,340 --> 01:16:55,619
Like, do I believe in the dolphins

809
01:16:55,619 --> 01:16:57,859
or do I believe that a dolphin as an animal exists?

810
01:16:58,659 --> 01:17:01,619
I feel like you mean, like,

811
01:17:01,619 --> 01:17:04,260
do I believe in the dolphins, like the football team?

812
01:17:08,630 --> 01:17:11,220
Which, not a great season last year.

813
01:17:12,020 --> 01:17:13,460
Not a good season last year.

814
01:17:14,180 --> 01:17:17,189
What did they do?

815
01:17:17,829 --> 01:17:18,390
Fucking...

816
01:17:19,189 --> 01:17:21,880
What was their record last year?

817
01:17:22,760 --> 01:17:28,140
Dolphins did, like, they were all right last year.

818
01:17:32,229 --> 01:17:32,869
Nine and eight?

819
01:17:35,289 --> 01:17:36,489
Jeez, could get a little better.

820
01:17:37,130 --> 01:17:45,020
Jesus.

821
01:17:48,199 --> 01:17:48,920
The dragon?

822
01:17:50,460 --> 01:17:51,500
Wait, wasn't that my name?

823
01:17:53,500 --> 01:18:07,189
I'll get, I'll hit you with the Precision Dodge all day.

824
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:21,479
2300!

825
01:18:36,939 --> 01:18:38,810
I'm gonna hit you with,

826
01:18:38,810 --> 01:18:40,250
I'm gonna hit you with Precision every day.

827
01:18:41,050 --> 01:18:59,960
Ow!

828
01:19:00,199 --> 01:19:00,699
Torgl!

829
01:19:01,319 --> 01:19:13,550
Dude, Jerma is so precise.

830
01:19:14,189 --> 01:19:15,279
That's what I like to hear.

831
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:24,670
Dragon Talon?

832
01:19:26,680 --> 01:19:28,039
Ooh, using it in crafting.

833
01:19:31,369 --> 01:19:32,329
No one said that.

834
01:19:32,329 --> 01:19:33,609
Go look at the logs, yes they did.

835
01:19:34,170 --> 01:19:38,239
Must be a nest nearby.

836
01:19:39,199 --> 01:19:47,069
Keep your eyes open.

837
01:19:47,069 --> 01:19:48,189
Can I have a heal, Torgl?

838
01:20:00,109 --> 01:20:02,109
Insufficient inventory space, potion used.

839
01:20:02,109 --> 01:20:03,229
Oh, I'm out of room.

840
01:20:03,229 --> 01:20:04,989
It appears we won't be going this way.

841
01:20:11,340 --> 01:20:19,100
What is it, Torgl?

842
01:20:21,069 --> 01:20:21,630
Got something!

843
01:20:25,420 --> 01:20:27,020
Why trust in your own animal instinct

844
01:20:27,020 --> 01:20:29,420
when you now have an actual animal at your side?

845
01:20:29,979 --> 01:20:32,699
If you're lost, hold down L3,

846
01:20:32,699 --> 01:20:37,560
and let Torgl point you in the right direction.

847
01:20:37,560 --> 01:20:40,600
Ooh, you're so smart.

848
01:20:44,810 --> 01:20:45,310
No!

849
01:20:49,579 --> 01:20:51,260
Okay, here we go.

850
01:20:51,899 --> 01:20:53,819
There we go, that's what I was trying to do.

851
01:20:53,819 --> 01:20:54,779
That's what I was going for.

852
01:21:02,399 --> 01:21:03,119
Oh, a treat!

853
01:21:11,720 --> 01:21:14,600
My mouse is on the unsubscribe button.

854
01:21:14,600 --> 01:21:15,800
You better be careful.

855
01:21:17,310 --> 01:21:18,189
I was careful.

856
01:21:20,619 --> 01:21:21,500
Hovering over it.

857
01:21:47,979 --> 01:21:49,020
New enemies approaching.

858
01:21:50,720 --> 01:21:51,760
This is stupid.

859
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:04,859
All right, give it to this thing first.

860
01:22:20,699 --> 01:22:21,199
Cool.

861
01:22:30,439 --> 01:22:35,609
You're so precise.

862
01:22:36,090 --> 01:22:42,600
Did you give your thoughts on the Mario RPG remake?

863
01:22:42,600 --> 01:22:43,079
I did.

864
01:22:43,079 --> 01:22:44,279
It went like this.

865
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:55,840
Just make sure you take that image

866
01:22:55,840 --> 01:22:59,439
and like blow the contrast up times a thousand.

867
01:22:59,439 --> 01:23:01,520
Make my eyes wicked blue.

868
01:23:01,920 --> 01:23:03,279
What a wicked blue.

869
01:23:03,279 --> 01:23:04,960
Way blue, more blue than they really are.

870
01:23:05,840 --> 01:23:08,079
And then superimpose that on top of any other topic.

871
01:23:26,199 --> 01:23:27,880
Yeah, I'm very excited about it.

872
01:23:27,880 --> 01:23:29,079
Like one of my favorite.

873
01:23:29,079 --> 01:23:30,279
Yeah, no guys.

874
01:23:30,279 --> 01:23:33,880
One of my favorite games ever created.

875
01:23:33,880 --> 01:23:35,560
Ever since I was a child.

876
01:23:36,520 --> 01:23:37,640
No, I don't.

877
01:23:37,640 --> 01:23:39,079
You know, whatever.

878
01:23:39,079 --> 01:23:41,079
Whoa, whoopsie, whoopsie daisy.

879
01:23:42,359 --> 01:23:43,689
Whoopsie daisy.

880
01:23:44,409 --> 01:23:49,239
I'm very excited for it.

881
01:23:49,239 --> 01:24:03,159
Boss fight.

882
01:24:03,960 --> 01:24:07,119
All right, make sure you get your...

883
01:24:07,119 --> 01:24:09,039
Look at how precisely his comments ready.

884
01:24:09,840 --> 01:24:13,079
I'd like to see them very soon.

885
01:24:32,750 --> 01:24:34,000
All right.

886
01:24:34,619 --> 01:24:46,180
Ow!

887
01:24:46,479 --> 01:24:52,399
All right, all right, all right.

888
01:24:53,199 --> 01:24:54,079
We just got real here.

889
01:25:09,880 --> 01:25:11,319
Oh, shit, that really hurt.

890
01:25:12,279 --> 01:25:23,310
Oh, it takes a little bit longer.

891
01:25:24,810 --> 01:25:27,609
Oh, look at how precise he is.

892
01:25:35,930 --> 01:25:49,279
Shit, I could have gotten it every time.

893
01:25:49,279 --> 01:25:49,920
Nobody said that.

894
01:25:49,920 --> 01:25:50,420
I did.

895
01:25:51,119 --> 01:25:54,859
All right, let's go.

896
01:25:55,500 --> 01:26:11,020
That wasn't bad.

897
01:26:22,119 --> 01:26:25,319
Oh, my God.

898
01:26:28,079 --> 01:26:28,479
What?

899
01:26:28,479 --> 01:26:30,079
Oh, God damn it.

900
01:26:32,319 --> 01:27:02,510
Oh, I thought I dodged it.

901
01:27:03,149 --> 01:27:06,079
No, I wanted to...

902
01:27:06,800 --> 01:27:26,989
Charge it.

903
01:27:37,319 --> 01:27:39,000
All right, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

904
01:27:52,920 --> 01:27:53,560
See you later.

905
01:28:06,010 --> 01:28:06,970
All right, I'm gonna end it like this.

906
01:28:06,970 --> 01:28:07,770
One, two, three.

907
01:28:07,770 --> 01:28:08,270
Goodbye.

908
01:28:13,279 --> 01:28:16,010
I will never stop spamming caps.

909
01:28:16,010 --> 01:28:17,609
Well, you're gonna get timed out.

910
01:28:18,170 --> 01:28:22,029
Pretty good precision, I think.

911
01:28:31,180 --> 01:28:31,979
Move your camera.

912
01:28:32,939 --> 01:28:33,659
Where do I go with it?

913
01:28:34,300 --> 01:28:36,260
Right here?

914
01:28:39,479 --> 01:28:39,979
Phase two?

915
01:29:06,569 --> 01:29:07,689
That was actually pretty...

916
01:29:08,569 --> 01:29:09,369
That was pretty crazy.

917
01:29:25,609 --> 01:29:27,689
Oh, bloody Rome of strapping young lads.

918
01:29:28,329 --> 01:29:30,600
And it was this sorry sack of bones,

919
01:29:30,600 --> 01:29:31,960
Rome, who saw fit to home.

920
01:29:32,760 --> 01:29:38,279
He's so cool.

921
01:29:39,159 --> 01:29:39,659
Sid.

922
01:29:40,039 --> 01:29:40,920
Did he like that with...

923
01:29:47,340 --> 01:29:49,100
That's a good image.

924
01:29:49,100 --> 01:29:50,939
But I don't want to put it on screen.

925
01:29:51,500 --> 01:29:52,460
What's in it for me?

926
01:29:53,100 --> 01:29:54,699
The same as for all of us.

927
01:29:55,579 --> 01:29:57,100
What we want and deserve.

928
01:29:58,699 --> 01:30:00,140
Save for our knack.

929
01:30:00,140 --> 01:30:02,939
Dominance and bearers are no different from anyone else.

930
01:30:03,979 --> 01:30:06,699
The ability to use magic or summon great beasts

931
01:30:06,699 --> 01:30:07,899
should command respect,

932
01:30:07,899 --> 01:30:09,659
but instead has left us outcasts.

933
01:30:10,220 --> 01:30:12,619
Our kind are used and discarded like tools,

934
01:30:12,619 --> 01:30:13,659
yet we are men.

935
01:30:13,659 --> 01:30:15,180
So why must we die as less?

936
01:30:15,979 --> 01:30:16,479
I see.

937
01:30:17,180 --> 01:30:19,899
So what you're saying is you want to start a war.

938
01:30:21,340 --> 01:30:24,880
You flatter me, lad.

939
01:30:25,520 --> 01:30:29,039
But my days as a firebrand are long behind me.

940
01:30:29,039 --> 01:30:31,680
No, I only wish to offer our kind of choice.

941
01:30:32,399 --> 01:30:34,800
A place where we can die on our own terms.

942
01:30:35,760 --> 01:30:36,880
Hey.

943
01:30:39,279 --> 01:30:40,239
Take a big shove.

944
01:30:40,880 --> 01:30:49,260
How do you feel, good boy?

945
01:30:49,819 --> 01:30:59,630
Can I give him a treat, too?

946
01:30:59,630 --> 01:31:00,590
Mejmer was like, here!

947
01:31:01,149 --> 01:31:06,880
He was like, anything I'm missing here?

948
01:31:10,569 --> 01:31:11,210
Damn.

949
01:31:11,210 --> 01:31:16,539
Okay.

950
01:31:16,539 --> 01:31:17,979
Let's make sure I didn't miss anything.

951
01:31:17,979 --> 01:31:30,720
What exactly do you plan on doing

952
01:31:30,720 --> 01:31:32,319
when you find this dominant of fire?

953
01:31:32,880 --> 01:31:33,680
What do you think?

954
01:31:34,399 --> 01:31:36,810
I'll show him the mercy he showed my brother

955
01:31:37,449 --> 01:31:38,890
and cut out the tongue of any man

956
01:31:38,890 --> 01:31:40,250
who tries to talk me out of it.

957
01:31:41,050 --> 01:31:41,550
All right.

958
01:31:42,569 --> 01:31:43,930
Forest Dark enough as it is.

959
01:31:43,930 --> 01:32:09,239
I'm just taking it in.

960
01:32:19,979 --> 01:32:21,100
Level 11 Hornets.

961
01:32:21,819 --> 01:32:39,960
Level 11 Hornets.

962
01:32:40,680 --> 01:32:44,810
Yeah, the soundtrack is so good.

963
01:32:44,810 --> 01:32:45,449
I love it.

964
01:32:49,930 --> 01:32:52,810
Yeah, you know when I'm asking for OSTs?

965
01:32:52,810 --> 01:32:53,930
Like, oh, man, I was here.

966
01:32:53,930 --> 01:32:54,970
OST, you guys want to do?

967
01:32:54,970 --> 01:32:55,609
I already got one.

968
01:32:56,569 --> 01:32:57,369
I'll put on this one.

969
01:33:09,420 --> 01:33:10,880
Put it over here?

970
01:33:11,600 --> 01:33:13,800
Okay.

971
01:33:13,800 --> 01:33:14,520
I'm going over here.

972
01:33:15,319 --> 01:33:24,000
Whoa.

973
01:33:24,699 --> 01:33:35,239
Okay, easy, easy.

974
01:33:39,600 --> 01:33:44,600
I thought I dodged it.

975
01:33:47,159 --> 01:33:48,039
My Wounds Boy.

976
01:33:49,079 --> 01:34:06,319
Not bad.

977
01:34:28,729 --> 01:34:50,430
All right.

978
01:34:50,430 --> 01:34:51,229
Bloody hides.

979
01:34:55,579 --> 01:34:56,060
Ocean.

980
01:34:56,060 --> 01:34:56,699
Actually, I need to.

981
01:34:59,600 --> 01:34:59,920
Okay.

982
01:34:59,920 --> 01:35:00,800
Something in this cave.

983
01:35:04,720 --> 01:35:05,279
Meteorite.

984
01:35:11,039 --> 01:35:12,079
Dude, epic, Jerma.

985
01:35:12,079 --> 01:35:12,560
Great job.

986
01:35:12,560 --> 01:35:12,800
Thanks.

987
01:35:13,439 --> 01:35:24,670
Yeah, I'm off.

988
01:35:24,670 --> 01:35:27,880
Stop talking to yourself.

989
01:35:27,880 --> 01:35:29,560
That's literally a live streamer.

990
01:35:57,399 --> 01:35:58,279
You don't need to lower check.

991
01:36:03,760 --> 01:36:09,020
Excellent.

992
01:36:15,739 --> 01:36:16,300
We move.

993
01:36:16,939 --> 01:36:19,260
Dude, I forgot everything.

994
01:36:19,260 --> 01:36:19,500
Please.

995
01:36:19,500 --> 01:36:20,380
Can I have a lower check?

996
01:36:20,380 --> 01:36:21,420
I don't understand.

997
01:36:21,420 --> 01:36:32,409
It is true.

998
01:36:32,409 --> 01:36:35,210
My leech values loyalty above all else.

999
01:36:37,130 --> 01:36:39,449
But where are you not quick to betray your countrymen

1000
01:36:39,449 --> 01:36:40,729
for the promise of coin?

1001
01:36:42,729 --> 01:36:43,050
God.

1002
01:36:44,250 --> 01:36:53,710
Damn.

1003
01:36:53,710 --> 01:37:09,899
Benedicta Harmon, commander of Waluld's elite intelligences.

1004
01:37:10,619 --> 01:37:13,920
We can capture her.

1005
01:37:13,920 --> 01:37:16,779
What did you do that for?

1006
01:37:16,779 --> 01:37:19,819
You.

1007
01:37:19,819 --> 01:37:20,619
She was showing off.

1008
01:37:23,609 --> 01:37:25,369
If you could make magic come out of your hands,

1009
01:37:25,369 --> 01:37:27,050
you wouldn't just show off randomly to your friends.

1010
01:37:29,739 --> 01:37:30,939
Imagine the birthday parties.

1011
01:37:30,939 --> 01:37:32,220
You'd be able to make so much cooler.

1012
01:37:33,199 --> 01:37:34,479
Let's get this over with.

1013
01:37:34,479 --> 01:37:44,399
At least they're not giant lizards.

1014
01:37:44,399 --> 01:37:44,880
Let's go.

1015
01:37:47,119 --> 01:37:47,920
You're already dead.

1016
01:37:49,520 --> 01:37:51,359
That guy was lying on the ground when we got over here.

1017
01:37:52,239 --> 01:38:09,289
Ow, that hurt.

1018
01:38:36,729 --> 01:38:39,899
Oh, it's rank time.

1019
01:38:39,899 --> 01:38:40,460
Oh, my God.

1020
01:38:41,100 --> 01:38:41,579
You're clear.

1021
01:38:52,859 --> 01:38:53,659
Get up.

1022
01:38:53,659 --> 01:39:08,750
Big damage.

1023
01:39:08,750 --> 01:39:09,229
Big damage.

1024
01:39:10,279 --> 01:39:10,920
Oh, my God.

1025
01:39:14,359 --> 01:39:16,920
Cinematic clash when the screen flashes orange like this

1026
01:39:16,920 --> 01:39:17,880
during a pivotal moment.

1027
01:39:17,880 --> 01:39:18,840
Repeat it.

1028
01:39:18,840 --> 01:39:19,880
Don't even tell me anything else.

1029
01:39:20,760 --> 01:39:41,000
I'll never fail one of those ever.

1030
01:40:03,659 --> 01:40:04,060
That hurt.

1031
01:40:07,529 --> 01:40:09,659
Ready to go.

1032
01:40:42,939 --> 01:40:45,560
Everybody get up.

1033
01:41:04,039 --> 01:41:04,600
Buton?

1034
01:41:05,560 --> 01:41:06,439
What's Buton?

1035
01:41:18,939 --> 01:41:19,819
Oh, I'm going to die.

1036
01:41:19,819 --> 01:41:23,689
I'm not.

1037
01:41:42,199 --> 01:41:42,439
Tap.

1038
01:41:58,750 --> 01:41:59,069
Again.

1039
01:42:06,489 --> 01:42:07,130
Oh, shit.

1040
01:42:08,409 --> 01:42:13,050
The boss fights are so fucking fun.

1041
01:42:13,050 --> 01:42:14,010
I'm just telling you.

1042
01:42:23,239 --> 01:42:24,680
Badge of Might is an accessory.

1043
01:42:25,399 --> 01:42:29,000
Oh, it is.

1044
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:29,479
Okay.

1045
01:42:29,479 --> 01:42:30,760
Attack by seven.

1046
01:42:30,760 --> 01:42:32,060
Look at how precise that was.

1047
01:42:32,060 --> 01:42:33,420
That's not even a boss either.

1048
01:42:33,420 --> 01:42:33,819
Really.

1049
01:42:39,640 --> 01:42:40,359
I'm sleeping right now.

1050
01:42:40,359 --> 01:42:41,479
My dreams are kind of weird.

1051
01:42:43,579 --> 01:42:44,699
Are you typing?

1052
01:42:44,699 --> 01:42:50,829
What's the face you make when you hit a cinematic slash?

1053
01:42:50,829 --> 01:42:51,229
This one.

1054
01:42:51,949 --> 01:42:56,189
They thought we were Imperials.

1055
01:42:58,640 --> 01:42:59,840
You do look the part.

1056
01:42:59,840 --> 01:43:07,100
Fight like a true shield of Rosaria.

1057
01:43:07,100 --> 01:43:09,689
Blast by the phoenix of that.

1058
01:43:10,409 --> 01:43:12,479
What's wrong with that face?

1059
01:43:13,199 --> 01:43:24,600
Speaking of which, I wonder.

1060
01:43:24,600 --> 01:43:27,659
Does the other icon of fire give blessings, do you think?

1061
01:43:29,289 --> 01:43:30,170
You don't believe me.

1062
01:43:31,130 --> 01:43:36,279
And lo, the creator did make of the elements eight icons

1063
01:43:36,279 --> 01:43:38,119
to serve as keepers of the one roar.

1064
01:43:41,039 --> 01:43:43,840
Not that I've ever set too much store by holy doctrine.

1065
01:43:44,560 --> 01:43:46,239
But on that point, it's clear.

1066
01:43:47,119 --> 01:43:53,920
Fire has always had just the one warden as of all the rest.

1067
01:43:53,920 --> 01:43:56,399
A new one can't be born until the previous dies.

1068
01:43:57,199 --> 01:43:58,560
And even that can take years.

1069
01:43:59,680 --> 01:44:05,069
Thank God the face game is too scary for me.

1070
01:44:05,710 --> 01:44:12,760
You don't strike me as a liar, which leaves but one person

1071
01:44:12,760 --> 01:44:15,000
who might be able to shed some light on the matter.

1072
01:44:16,220 --> 01:44:17,579
And they're in a lost swing.

1073
01:44:21,689 --> 01:44:22,329
Oh, son.

1074
01:44:22,329 --> 01:44:23,210
What game are you playing?

1075
01:44:23,210 --> 01:44:25,449
Can you catch me up on the plot before I walk upstairs?

1076
01:44:27,609 --> 01:44:30,779
What if someone discovers the bodies?

1077
01:44:31,579 --> 01:44:34,029
Well, they'll be sorely disappointed.

1078
01:44:36,350 --> 01:44:48,270
Stage replay in arcade mode.

1079
01:44:48,270 --> 01:44:50,109
Is it an arcade mode?

1080
01:44:50,109 --> 01:44:52,680
In the hideaway.

1081
01:44:53,239 --> 01:44:57,159
So you can just kind of do just wonder what arcade mode is.

1082
01:44:57,159 --> 01:45:08,119
So this is Orbel Downs.

1083
01:45:08,760 --> 01:45:10,460
All right, so there's new missions back here.

1084
01:45:10,460 --> 01:45:11,739
I kind of want to upgrade my weapon.

1085
01:45:12,380 --> 01:45:13,689
Or should I just keep going?

1086
01:45:17,449 --> 01:45:19,130
There's a new side quest back here.

1087
01:45:19,130 --> 01:45:23,880
I think I should upgrade.

1088
01:45:24,439 --> 01:45:28,760
I want to check it out.

1089
01:45:28,760 --> 01:45:31,600
Hey, you do you?

1090
01:45:32,479 --> 01:45:32,800
Yeah.

1091
01:45:33,439 --> 01:45:40,060
New crafting recipe is available.

1092
01:45:47,529 --> 01:45:48,329
Longsword.

1093
01:45:49,739 --> 01:45:50,939
Longsword's better than...

1094
01:45:50,939 --> 01:45:54,109
Wait, okay.

1095
01:45:56,430 --> 01:45:57,630
Longsword, how much money do I have?

1096
01:45:58,189 --> 01:45:58,829
I got money.

1097
01:46:08,039 --> 01:46:09,720
Is it worth spending 700 right now?

1098
01:46:21,949 --> 01:46:23,390
I could craft a longsword.

1099
01:46:24,109 --> 01:46:26,840
Or I could do this broadsword plus one

1100
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:29,680
as good as just crap.

1101
01:46:29,680 --> 01:46:31,600
Maybe I should craft a longsword and upgrade a longsword.

1102
01:46:35,239 --> 01:46:37,319
This does take a dragon talon, though.

1103
01:46:37,319 --> 01:46:40,199
I would probably just go buy it.

1104
01:46:42,970 --> 01:46:44,569
I'm going to go buy it and then upgrade it.

1105
01:46:45,289 --> 01:46:49,659
Wait, do I?

1106
01:46:49,659 --> 01:46:50,539
No, I don't have one already.

1107
01:46:51,100 --> 01:46:54,239
I don't think you have the longsword equipped.

1108
01:46:54,239 --> 01:46:56,159
Oh, I don't think I have the longsword

1109
01:46:56,720 --> 01:46:58,319
because I bought the broadsword.

1110
01:46:59,039 --> 01:47:01,279
And then the thing I started was the Imperial Infantry Blade.

1111
01:47:01,279 --> 01:47:02,560
It's just the starter weapon.

1112
01:47:02,560 --> 01:47:03,920
I have the broadsword on right now,

1113
01:47:03,920 --> 01:47:05,279
but the longsword looks like it's just better.

1114
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:06,880
I'm going to buy...

1115
01:47:07,680 --> 01:47:08,399
Is this you own it?

1116
01:47:10,569 --> 01:47:11,210
I don't think so.

1117
01:47:11,210 --> 01:47:12,890
All right, I'll buy it.

1118
01:47:18,829 --> 01:47:19,789
I want to save the materials.

1119
01:47:24,199 --> 01:47:25,399
I'll sell the broadsword back.

1120
01:47:26,039 --> 01:47:28,039
I think that makes sense, right?

1121
01:47:34,079 --> 01:47:36,560
Because crafting this, I have to use a gnarled scale.

1122
01:47:36,560 --> 01:47:37,760
I have two of those.

1123
01:47:37,760 --> 01:47:38,960
With this one, I...

1124
01:47:38,960 --> 01:47:41,050
Oh, yeah, see?

1125
01:47:41,050 --> 01:47:43,659
I have to use a gnarled scale for this.

1126
01:47:43,659 --> 01:47:45,100
Why not just use it on upgrades?

1127
01:47:45,100 --> 01:47:45,739
I have the money.

1128
01:47:46,300 --> 01:47:48,119
Let's go for it.

1129
01:47:53,819 --> 01:47:54,619
I could do it again.

1130
01:48:00,359 --> 01:48:03,880
I have three meteorite, so I'm just going to go again.

1131
01:48:03,880 --> 01:48:05,079
You can find me later.

1132
01:48:05,640 --> 01:48:07,130
I could do it again.

1133
01:48:07,130 --> 01:48:10,199
No, I couldn't.

1134
01:48:10,199 --> 01:48:11,000
Cool.

1135
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:13,560
All right.

1136
01:48:13,560 --> 01:48:14,840
Keep going.

1137
01:48:14,840 --> 01:48:15,960
I think that's all I can do.

1138
01:48:15,960 --> 01:48:16,439
So let me...

1139
01:48:16,439 --> 01:48:17,399
What about other stuff?

1140
01:48:19,310 --> 01:48:21,130
Iron racers?

1141
01:48:21,689 --> 01:48:25,470
I think I have...

1142
01:48:26,670 --> 01:48:28,510
I could do iron belt plus two.

1143
01:48:28,510 --> 01:48:30,590
Although what about...

1144
01:48:30,590 --> 01:48:30,989
What do you...

1145
01:48:30,989 --> 01:48:33,789
Okay, wolfskin sash.

1146
01:48:33,789 --> 01:48:34,670
28.

1147
01:48:34,670 --> 01:48:40,729
28 versus 26 and two health.

1148
01:48:40,729 --> 01:48:41,850
This one just gives 28.

1149
01:48:41,850 --> 01:48:43,449
28 defense versus health.

1150
01:48:43,449 --> 01:48:49,500
Just don't get hit.

1151
01:48:49,500 --> 01:48:51,840
That's true.

1152
01:48:51,840 --> 01:48:53,039
I'll take the health.

1153
01:48:53,039 --> 01:48:58,729
This is just better, though.

1154
01:48:58,729 --> 01:49:00,699
All right, I'm going to...

1155
01:49:00,699 --> 01:49:01,500
All right, here's what's happening.

1156
01:49:01,500 --> 01:49:04,159
I'm going to make this sash.

1157
01:49:04,159 --> 01:49:05,199
Then I'll upgrade it.

1158
01:49:05,199 --> 01:49:06,239
I do say so myself.

1159
01:49:06,880 --> 01:49:15,359
Okay, so this is going to be good before health.

1160
01:49:17,760 --> 01:49:19,840
Yeah, see, this is only two, even if it's plus two.

1161
01:49:19,840 --> 01:49:21,600
Okay, yeah, we'll do this one plus two.

1162
01:49:22,239 --> 01:49:23,439
You can find me later.

1163
01:49:24,239 --> 01:49:27,039
Trophy earned.

1164
01:49:27,039 --> 01:49:29,609
Okay, cool.

1165
01:49:29,609 --> 01:49:30,729
Can't really do any of these.

1166
01:49:31,529 --> 01:49:33,640
Do I...

1167
01:49:33,640 --> 01:49:35,239
I have iron burses on right now, I do.

1168
01:49:37,039 --> 01:49:37,920
Okay, we're good.

1169
01:49:40,399 --> 01:49:42,640
I should buy some heals, though, right?

1170
01:49:44,170 --> 01:49:44,890
Kind of low.

1171
01:49:48,220 --> 01:49:48,859
Installed.

1172
01:49:49,500 --> 01:49:52,060
Why do you look like a gigachat right now?

1173
01:49:52,060 --> 01:49:53,659
I think I look like gigachat.

1174
01:49:58,329 --> 01:49:58,729
What do you got?

1175
01:49:58,729 --> 01:49:59,289
You got a mission?

1176
01:50:01,119 --> 01:50:01,600
Damn it.

1177
01:50:01,600 --> 01:50:03,439
We'll be needing more wood.

1178
01:50:03,439 --> 01:50:06,250
If I step away to fetch any,

1179
01:50:06,250 --> 01:50:11,149
this lot will be down around our ears.

1180
01:50:11,149 --> 01:50:11,869
Ah, you there.

1181
01:50:12,510 --> 01:50:13,869
Perfect timing.

1182
01:50:13,869 --> 01:50:16,270
I couldn't persuade you to fetch me some timber, could I?

1183
01:50:16,829 --> 01:50:21,199
Ooh, what do I get for it?

1184
01:50:22,010 --> 01:50:22,970
I'd be happy to.

1185
01:50:24,010 --> 01:50:25,210
Oh, thank you.

1186
01:50:25,210 --> 01:50:27,449
You'll be helping me and the hideaway both.

1187
01:50:28,170 --> 01:50:29,369
Side mission.

1188
01:50:29,369 --> 01:50:29,930
Let's go.

1189
01:50:31,609 --> 01:50:33,210
More than we can manage, if I'm honest.

1190
01:50:33,930 --> 01:50:35,930
It certainly looks like you've got your hands full.

1191
01:50:36,649 --> 01:50:38,250
Ah, you can say that again.

1192
01:50:38,250 --> 01:50:40,729
The fallen knew their craft, make no mistake.

1193
01:50:40,729 --> 01:50:42,890
But not even their handiwork lasts forever.

1194
01:50:42,890 --> 01:50:44,170
This guy looks like the kind of person that...

1195
01:50:44,170 --> 01:50:45,529
That's why the walls need shoring up.

1196
01:50:45,529 --> 01:50:48,970
...always finishes top three in the arm wrestling competition every year.

1197
01:50:48,970 --> 01:50:50,329
...for our first harvest now, can we?

1198
01:50:51,289 --> 01:50:54,220
No, I suppose not.

1199
01:50:54,939 --> 01:50:57,979
Where can I find this wood?

1200
01:50:58,939 --> 01:51:00,380
Ask over at the white ads.

1201
01:51:01,020 --> 01:51:02,460
They'll point you in the right direction.

1202
01:51:03,100 --> 01:51:03,979
Thanks again.

1203
01:51:03,979 --> 01:51:04,220
Okay.

1204
01:51:04,220 --> 01:51:05,420
I really appreciate the help.

1205
01:51:07,260 --> 01:51:07,500
Yeah.

1206
01:51:10,800 --> 01:51:12,000
Let's prioritize this.

1207
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:13,359
Let's do some good stuff.

1208
01:51:16,039 --> 01:51:16,920
Hashtag add.

1209
01:51:16,920 --> 01:51:17,319
Oh, yeah.

1210
01:51:18,199 --> 01:51:20,699
Square Enix sponsored this stream.

1211
01:51:22,859 --> 01:51:24,300
I think the game is fantastic.

1212
01:51:24,939 --> 01:51:26,720
I really mean that.

1213
01:51:26,720 --> 01:51:29,439
I am going to finish this game.

1214
01:51:29,439 --> 01:51:30,560
I'm going to play it all the way through.

1215
01:51:32,590 --> 01:51:33,869
I really like it.

1216
01:51:34,510 --> 01:51:36,750
Yeah, it's out on PS5 right now.

1217
01:51:38,569 --> 01:51:39,609
You can also get the demo.

1218
01:51:39,609 --> 01:51:41,050
The demo is still available too.

1219
01:51:43,880 --> 01:51:45,800
Coin purse weighing you down.

1220
01:51:45,800 --> 01:51:47,319
Okay, I want to sell some stuff.

1221
01:51:47,319 --> 01:51:48,520
I'm going to sell the broadsword.

1222
01:51:48,520 --> 01:51:51,000
It's probably a bad idea, but somebody will scream at me.

1223
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:52,600
I reckon I can find a buyer.

1224
01:51:52,600 --> 01:51:56,000
I'm getting rid of the infantry belt.

1225
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:59,279
I know, but what about just for drip?

1226
01:51:59,279 --> 01:52:00,479
No, it's fine.

1227
01:52:01,359 --> 01:52:03,310
All right, I got to equip this.

1228
01:52:03,949 --> 01:52:04,670
Come again.

1229
01:52:11,260 --> 01:52:12,859
All right, I don't want to put these ones on.

1230
01:52:12,859 --> 01:52:17,920
This is the rings that give you much more damage and power and stuff.

1231
01:52:18,479 --> 01:52:20,750
I just want this one, the one that I found.

1232
01:52:27,020 --> 01:52:28,220
There is my sword.

1233
01:52:28,220 --> 01:52:29,100
That looks good.

1234
01:52:29,819 --> 01:52:33,079
Okay, yeah, it's only on PS5 right now.

1235
01:52:36,640 --> 01:52:37,520
Only on PS5.

1236
01:52:42,750 --> 01:52:45,149
Can you see the chat's donations things?

1237
01:52:45,149 --> 01:52:49,710
Yeah, like I said before, it's a new feature.

1238
01:52:49,710 --> 01:52:51,390
I don't really know what it is, but I'll look into it.

1239
01:52:51,390 --> 01:52:54,109
I'll see what it is, but I can reiterate.

1240
01:52:54,109 --> 01:52:56,029
I do not read donations or subs on stream.

1241
01:52:58,029 --> 01:53:03,369
I'll say I've had for a long time and could tell you why.

1242
01:53:04,170 --> 01:53:07,260
But already, you know, let's go.

1243
01:53:09,319 --> 01:53:10,439
Excuse me.

1244
01:53:10,439 --> 01:53:14,079
The man working over by the garden sent me to fetch some wood.

1245
01:53:14,079 --> 01:53:14,960
Do I have to cut the wood?

1246
01:53:14,960 --> 01:53:17,439
Ah, that'll be Jeffrey, master carpenter.

1247
01:53:18,079 --> 01:53:18,800
Luck would have it.

1248
01:53:18,800 --> 01:53:20,640
We've just finished cutting the timber he's after.

1249
01:53:21,439 --> 01:53:23,279
You take as much as you need from the stack.

1250
01:53:24,319 --> 01:53:24,800
Thank you.

1251
01:53:25,600 --> 01:53:26,399
So let's just grab it.

1252
01:53:26,399 --> 01:53:27,279
No, not at all.

1253
01:53:27,279 --> 01:53:28,720
We appreciate the assistance.

1254
01:53:29,600 --> 01:53:34,989
Collect the planks.

1255
01:53:35,550 --> 01:53:38,939
Here we are.

1256
01:53:38,939 --> 01:53:40,010
Okay.

1257
01:53:40,010 --> 01:53:43,289
You better get this to Jeffrey, was it?

1258
01:53:43,689 --> 01:53:46,960
Hold on.

1259
01:53:46,960 --> 01:53:47,680
Let me help you here.

1260
01:53:48,699 --> 01:53:50,460
Ah, fuck if I know, man.

1261
01:53:53,119 --> 01:53:53,920
I don't know either.

1262
01:53:54,479 --> 01:54:06,510
I've fetched in that wood.

1263
01:54:06,510 --> 01:54:07,550
Wasn't too much trouble.

1264
01:54:08,189 --> 01:54:13,310
I get money for this.

1265
01:54:13,869 --> 01:54:14,960
Will this be enough?

1266
01:54:16,270 --> 01:54:17,630
This will do nicely.

1267
01:54:17,630 --> 01:54:18,590
Thank you.

1268
01:54:18,590 --> 01:54:22,029
With a bit of luck, the walls won't be falling in on us just yet.

1269
01:54:22,590 --> 01:54:23,630
That sounds ominous.

1270
01:54:24,270 --> 01:54:28,039
It's not as bad as all that.

1271
01:54:28,039 --> 01:54:30,600
And it's a damn sight better than the alternative.

1272
01:54:30,600 --> 01:54:31,079
We're safe.

1273
01:54:31,079 --> 01:54:32,119
We're warm and we're hidden.

1274
01:54:32,680 --> 01:54:33,720
What more could we ask for?

1275
01:54:34,600 --> 01:54:36,600
Now stop fretting and take this.

1276
01:54:36,600 --> 01:54:37,560
You've earned it.

1277
01:54:37,560 --> 01:54:38,520
Welcome to the fold.

1278
01:54:40,409 --> 01:54:40,810
And?

1279
01:54:40,810 --> 01:54:41,689
There's no need to.

1280
01:54:42,489 --> 01:54:44,489
That's not a matter of need, my friend.

1281
01:54:44,489 --> 01:54:45,449
You're one of us now.

1282
01:54:46,010 --> 01:54:46,810
What do I get?

1283
01:54:47,529 --> 01:54:53,500
What do I get?

1284
01:54:58,510 --> 01:54:59,229
Meteorite.

1285
01:54:59,229 --> 01:54:59,949
That's pretty good.

1286
01:54:59,949 --> 01:55:01,149
And a gill bug.

1287
01:55:01,710 --> 01:55:04,199
Contrary to popular belief,

1288
01:55:04,199 --> 01:55:07,399
this small insect does not get its name from its appearance,

1289
01:55:07,399 --> 01:55:10,279
but rather from the fact that it is highly sought after by

1290
01:55:12,170 --> 01:55:12,810
fizzickers?

1291
01:55:13,449 --> 01:55:14,649
Fizzickers?

1292
01:55:14,649 --> 01:55:16,489
For use in brewing medicines.

1293
01:55:18,590 --> 01:55:20,670
In summer, when the beetles are most numerous,

1294
01:55:20,670 --> 01:55:26,039
children across the realm will spend nigh every waking hour collecting specimens

1295
01:55:26,039 --> 01:55:29,079
in readiness to exchange them for a handful of coppers.

1296
01:55:29,079 --> 01:55:33,560
As children have tiny hands, however, this amounts to fewer than one might expect.

1297
01:55:33,560 --> 01:55:44,619
Rate this bug on a tier list.

1298
01:55:45,260 --> 01:55:46,989
I don't know.

1299
01:55:48,479 --> 01:55:48,720
B?

1300
01:55:49,520 --> 01:55:50,399
All right, so I can sell that.

1301
01:55:51,119 --> 01:55:52,409
Should I sell it?

1302
01:55:52,409 --> 01:55:53,289
What if I get more stuff?

1303
01:55:54,489 --> 01:56:00,140
Oh, I'm curious about the arcade mode thing.

1304
01:56:00,140 --> 01:56:00,779
I was supposed to see it.

1305
01:56:04,170 --> 01:56:08,409
Replay any previously cleared stage and be awarded a score based on performance.

1306
01:56:08,409 --> 01:56:11,130
Restrictions on level gear consumables are applied.

1307
01:56:12,119 --> 01:56:15,159
Gameplay mode will default to action focused.

1308
01:56:15,159 --> 01:56:16,909
All right, that's cool.

1309
01:56:17,470 --> 01:56:19,260
Play a little challenge mode.

1310
01:56:22,909 --> 01:56:23,550
Go see...

1311
01:56:23,550 --> 01:56:24,590
Can you go see the moogle?

1312
01:56:24,590 --> 01:56:25,229
Where's the moogle?

1313
01:56:26,220 --> 01:56:27,260
Yeah, sure.

1314
01:56:27,260 --> 01:56:34,699
Where's the moogle?

1315
01:56:34,699 --> 01:56:40,829
Why is everybody doing mag?

1316
01:56:40,829 --> 01:56:47,020
Over by the board?

1317
01:56:47,659 --> 01:56:52,239
What board?

1318
01:56:52,880 --> 01:56:57,229
Why is everybody doing mag?

1319
01:56:57,229 --> 01:56:58,350
What happened?

1320
01:56:58,350 --> 01:57:01,710
Because they want moogle.

1321
01:57:02,270 --> 01:57:03,720
I gotta find moogle.

1322
01:57:03,720 --> 01:57:04,760
All right, let me sell this first.

1323
01:57:05,319 --> 01:57:08,250
Just said to sell this for a lot of money.

1324
01:57:16,800 --> 01:57:17,279
Heal bug.

1325
01:57:19,119 --> 01:57:20,319
Valuable can be sold.

1326
01:57:23,500 --> 01:57:23,899
200?

1327
01:57:26,300 --> 01:57:27,739
Would you eat a bug, be honest?

1328
01:57:28,460 --> 01:57:30,060
I don't know if I had.

1329
01:57:30,060 --> 01:57:30,380
Maybe.

1330
01:57:31,020 --> 01:57:33,739
I wouldn't be happy about it, but it would be like, whatever.

1331
01:57:33,739 --> 01:57:34,699
Do I have to eat bugs?

1332
01:57:34,699 --> 01:57:35,579
I don't know.

1333
01:57:35,579 --> 01:57:37,260
No, I don't know.

1334
01:57:39,529 --> 01:57:40,170
I don't know.

1335
01:57:40,970 --> 01:57:44,319
All right, let's go.

1336
01:57:44,319 --> 01:57:46,699
Wait, quest.

1337
01:57:55,789 --> 01:58:00,920
I want to make as much money as I can.

1338
01:58:00,920 --> 01:58:02,920
Ah, a new face.

1339
01:58:02,920 --> 01:58:06,430
And, dare I hope, a willing pair of hands.

1340
01:58:06,430 --> 01:58:11,310
The fat chocobo is a demanding mistress, and we are too few to keep her on her feet.

1341
01:58:11,310 --> 01:58:15,550
Might I persuade you to offer a meal or two to souls in need of sustenance?

1342
01:58:16,350 --> 01:58:21,710
For your trouble, I can offer you the contents of my strong box and my enduring gratitude.

1343
01:58:23,550 --> 01:58:24,750
There's not going to be anything in there.

1344
01:58:26,829 --> 01:58:28,270
Oh, there's 500 bucks in there.

1345
01:58:28,989 --> 01:58:30,270
And I see why not.

1346
01:58:31,359 --> 01:58:32,159
Marvelous.

1347
01:58:32,159 --> 01:58:34,800
And who exactly do I have the honor of addressing?

1348
01:58:35,680 --> 01:58:36,180
Clive.

1349
01:58:37,659 --> 01:58:39,899
Delighted to make your acquaintance, Clive.

1350
01:58:39,899 --> 01:58:45,340
I'm Kenneth, and mine are the weary shoulders upon which the weight of this fine establishment rests.

1351
01:58:46,619 --> 01:58:49,899
Now, I have three hungry customers awaiting their vittles.

1352
01:58:49,899 --> 01:58:52,380
Take these, if you would, and be careful.

1353
01:58:52,380 --> 01:58:53,020
They're hot.

1354
01:58:55,210 --> 01:58:56,409
I would eat that right now.

1355
01:58:57,289 --> 01:59:03,479
A meal.

1356
01:59:03,479 --> 01:59:06,279
Long as it been.

1357
01:59:06,279 --> 01:59:07,479
Can I just eat them all?

1358
01:59:12,010 --> 01:59:12,510
There you go.

1359
01:59:15,720 --> 01:59:16,840
Your food.

1360
01:59:16,840 --> 01:59:21,149
I was hoping it might be.

1361
01:59:21,789 --> 01:59:24,189
Well, doesn't this look fine?

1362
01:59:24,189 --> 01:59:24,989
Thank you, lad.

1363
01:59:26,010 --> 01:59:27,449
You're new, aren't you?

1364
01:59:27,449 --> 01:59:30,010
Kenneth's running your ragged already, I expect.

1365
01:59:30,010 --> 01:59:30,970
The old rascal.

1366
01:59:31,850 --> 01:59:32,409
Very hot.

1367
01:59:32,409 --> 01:59:32,810
Be careful.

1368
01:59:32,810 --> 01:59:34,970
I didn't say he'd give me something for my trouble.

1369
01:59:36,699 --> 01:59:37,819
And so he should.

1370
01:59:37,819 --> 01:59:39,739
We're not slaves anymore.

1371
01:59:39,739 --> 01:59:40,779
Well met, lad.

1372
01:59:40,779 --> 01:59:42,300
And keep up the good work.

1373
01:59:48,560 --> 01:59:49,920
I'm going to get 500 bucks.

1374
01:59:54,859 --> 01:59:59,710
Yeah.

1375
01:59:59,710 --> 02:00:02,189
Fully clad in armor, bringing your food to your table.

1376
02:00:02,829 --> 02:00:07,390
I hope you do not think me lazy for waiting to be served like a lord.

1377
02:00:07,390 --> 02:00:10,829
I mean, it's like a bunch of themed restaurants do that already, don't they?

1378
02:00:10,829 --> 02:00:12,750
Did not use me kindly, you see.

1379
02:00:13,390 --> 02:00:16,670
You left me half lame, truth be told.

1380
02:00:17,310 --> 02:00:19,949
That Sid took me in nonetheless.

1381
02:00:20,909 --> 02:00:21,409
Precise.

1382
02:00:23,369 --> 02:00:25,850
The hideaway is the home I never knew.

1383
02:00:26,649 --> 02:00:28,489
And a mighty fine one at that.

1384
02:00:32,670 --> 02:00:33,170
Enjoy.

1385
02:00:34,029 --> 02:00:42,680
Any crusty bread?

1386
02:00:42,680 --> 02:00:49,399
How can you have stew and no crusty bread?

1387
02:00:49,399 --> 02:00:54,189
Well, there's so much more to farming than just seeds and soil.

1388
02:00:54,189 --> 02:00:55,470
I'm talking bread that you have to like.

1389
02:00:57,869 --> 02:00:58,430
Your food.

1390
02:00:59,310 --> 02:01:00,029
Just a moment.

1391
02:01:00,029 --> 02:01:01,390
I need to finish this.

1392
02:01:01,390 --> 02:01:03,000
I won't be a burden.

1393
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:07,720
I'm of no use to anyone as I am, but maybe if I can master this.

1394
02:01:08,520 --> 02:01:11,930
All right, but see that you eat it before it gets cold.

1395
02:01:12,729 --> 02:01:13,210
Of course.

1396
02:01:15,500 --> 02:01:15,899
Thank you.

1397
02:01:16,539 --> 02:01:19,739
If I had a restaurant, I would name it with crusty bread.

1398
02:01:23,260 --> 02:01:24,779
That would be the name of my restaurant.

1399
02:01:25,420 --> 02:01:26,939
With crusty bread.

1400
02:01:27,500 --> 02:01:33,789
It'd be such a really hearty.

1401
02:01:34,590 --> 02:01:36,350
Everybody knows you're gonna when you come in.

1402
02:01:36,350 --> 02:01:38,109
When you when you're here, you come in here.

1403
02:01:38,109 --> 02:01:39,149
Your family in here.

1404
02:01:39,149 --> 02:01:39,710
You know what I mean?

1405
02:01:40,510 --> 02:01:49,789
Wait, did I not feed them?

1406
02:01:52,829 --> 02:01:54,350
Oh, no, no, no, I gotta turn it in.

1407
02:01:55,869 --> 02:01:57,710
All done, I presume.

1408
02:01:57,710 --> 02:01:58,350
Splendid.

1409
02:01:58,989 --> 02:01:59,789
They were bearers.

1410
02:02:01,050 --> 02:02:04,810
Stay away from my family master's pleasure.

1411
02:02:04,810 --> 02:02:08,220
But I'm waiting to be fed like equals.

1412
02:02:09,039 --> 02:02:13,920
Indeed, equality is the very cornerstone upon which our little community has found it.

1413
02:02:13,920 --> 02:02:15,279
You know, everything's gonna be warm.

1414
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:16,960
Beyond these walls.

1415
02:02:16,960 --> 02:02:18,319
Gonna be like candles and shit.

1416
02:02:20,079 --> 02:02:22,000
Speaking only when spoken to.

1417
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:24,159
Eating only what scraps our masters.

1418
02:02:24,159 --> 02:02:26,000
We have the best crusty bread.

1419
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:28,159
The first hot meal here in the city.

1420
02:02:28,159 --> 02:02:29,439
First, many will have known.

1421
02:02:30,159 --> 02:02:32,479
In the hideaway, we are free.

1422
02:02:32,479 --> 02:02:35,840
Truly free to speak as we please, when we please.

1423
02:02:35,840 --> 02:02:38,239
And to eat what and when we desire.

1424
02:02:39,119 --> 02:02:42,239
More than reason enough to trust in Sid's vision, wouldn't you say?

1425
02:02:42,239 --> 02:02:43,199
There's no utensils.

1426
02:02:43,199 --> 02:02:46,319
Now, I promised you something for your trouble, did I not?

1427
02:02:46,319 --> 02:02:49,359
This bread is gonna be so hard and so shit.

1428
02:02:50,159 --> 02:02:53,920
You're gonna have you pull it apart and you're gonna use that as utensils

1429
02:02:53,920 --> 02:02:55,279
to eat your soup and stew and stuff.

1430
02:03:01,369 --> 02:03:02,890
The bread is your utensil.

1431
02:03:08,399 --> 02:03:09,199
And why, right?

1432
02:03:09,199 --> 02:03:10,000
That's pretty good.

1433
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:12,560
And 500 bucks just, that was all right.

1434
02:03:14,539 --> 02:03:19,180
The table is made out of bread.

1435
02:03:19,180 --> 02:03:22,460
That restaurant would be open for, okay.

1436
02:03:22,460 --> 02:03:25,260
First of all, that restaurant's open for one or two days

1437
02:03:26,140 --> 02:03:27,659
before the whole thing gets closed.

1438
02:03:29,789 --> 02:03:30,829
Everything is edible.

1439
02:03:33,899 --> 02:03:35,659
Somebody's dog is gonna get, you know what I mean?

1440
02:03:35,659 --> 02:03:37,819
An animal is gonna get, like a bear is gonna get into that restaurant.

1441
02:03:37,819 --> 02:03:38,939
It's gonna be a fucking nightmare.

1442
02:03:39,739 --> 02:03:44,090
They'll be like, hey, stop eating the post to the table.

1443
02:03:44,649 --> 02:03:45,130
Oh no.

1444
02:03:48,430 --> 02:03:50,270
Rats, yeah, they'd be all, it'd be animals.

1445
02:03:50,270 --> 02:03:51,869
They'd be just animals all over the place.

1446
02:03:52,430 --> 02:03:56,670
It'd be like a weird cartoon moment where you'd be sitting there eating.

1447
02:03:56,670 --> 02:04:00,750
Oh, did you know that the table is edible?

1448
02:04:00,750 --> 02:04:02,989
And it just cuts down to one of the posts of the table

1449
02:04:02,989 --> 02:04:07,789
and there's a rat just gnawing on the very bottom to have it fall out.

1450
02:04:07,789 --> 02:04:09,550
And it just, the whole table falls

1451
02:04:09,550 --> 02:04:11,390
and my grandpa's soup goes up in his face.

1452
02:04:16,670 --> 02:04:17,869
The whole restaurant is edible.

1453
02:04:25,869 --> 02:04:27,789
The bathroom would have to be normal though.

1454
02:04:27,789 --> 02:04:29,710
The bathroom, it's a normal bathroom.

1455
02:04:30,430 --> 02:04:33,949
We can't have edible fucking urinals and edible toilets, guys.

1456
02:04:34,510 --> 02:04:36,510
The bathroom is a normal bathroom.

1457
02:04:38,380 --> 02:04:39,260
That does not work.

1458
02:04:40,060 --> 02:04:44,699
Why not?

1459
02:04:47,310 --> 02:04:47,949
All right, let's go.

1460
02:04:47,949 --> 02:04:48,989
That was fun.

1461
02:04:48,989 --> 02:04:49,949
I got my upgrades.

1462
02:04:49,949 --> 02:04:50,909
I'm ready to move.

1463
02:04:50,909 --> 02:04:58,729
Let's do the next part.

1464
02:04:58,729 --> 02:05:00,250
No one was thinking that except for you.

1465
02:05:00,250 --> 02:05:02,010
I was thinking ahead, actually.

1466
02:05:02,010 --> 02:05:04,520
I was thinking ahead.

1467
02:05:04,520 --> 02:05:05,560
Go back and get the chest.

1468
02:05:06,359 --> 02:05:07,560
Wait, what do you mean the chest?

1469
02:05:07,560 --> 02:05:09,479
Didn't he just deposit it into my fucking account?

1470
02:05:23,100 --> 02:05:24,140
Any idea what that is?

1471
02:05:24,140 --> 02:05:25,340
They built the village around.

1472
02:05:25,340 --> 02:05:25,979
Get the chest.

1473
02:05:25,979 --> 02:05:27,260
The Fallen Ruin.

1474
02:05:27,260 --> 02:05:29,609
I've heard someone call it an airship.

1475
02:05:30,250 --> 02:05:32,670
Though its flying days seem to be behind it.

1476
02:05:33,550 --> 02:05:34,649
It's a shame, that.

1477
02:05:35,289 --> 02:05:39,050
Do you truly think her dominance waiting for us in that village?

1478
02:05:39,689 --> 02:05:42,170
My scout has never given me any reason to doubt him,

1479
02:05:43,050 --> 02:05:44,729
which is why I think we should hurry.

1480
02:05:44,729 --> 02:05:45,229
Come on.

1481
02:05:45,930 --> 02:05:50,680
Just give me one second to go back.

1482
02:05:51,319 --> 02:05:59,579
A tuning with an obelisk allows Clive to travel quickly to the location

1483
02:05:59,579 --> 02:06:08,119
via both the world map and local map.

1484
02:06:08,119 --> 02:06:09,399
Louder than words.

1485
02:06:11,039 --> 02:06:11,760
Let me go back to the...

1486
02:06:13,119 --> 02:06:14,479
Are you guys messing with me here?

1487
02:06:15,439 --> 02:06:16,079
Is that for real?

1488
02:06:16,720 --> 02:06:19,319
This isn't the first time I've seen one of these.

1489
02:06:19,319 --> 02:06:21,470
Perhaps I can use them as waymarks.

1490
02:06:24,880 --> 02:06:26,079
Are you guys being for real?

1491
02:06:26,800 --> 02:06:31,949
Is there actually something in here?

1492
02:06:31,949 --> 02:06:33,550
Is there a chest I didn't get on the table?

1493
02:06:34,109 --> 02:06:46,560
Do you think we should go and help?

1494
02:06:47,770 --> 02:06:48,890
Oh, there is.

1495
02:06:48,890 --> 02:06:50,090
I thought you guys were lying to me.

1496
02:06:51,210 --> 02:06:51,930
Okay.

1497
02:06:51,930 --> 02:06:52,729
Hold on.

1498
02:06:52,729 --> 02:06:55,199
It's important.

1499
02:06:55,199 --> 02:06:55,600
Thank you.

1500
02:06:56,319 --> 02:07:03,050
That was badge of metal defense.

1501
02:07:03,050 --> 02:07:04,010
Yeah, we're gonna put that on.

1502
02:07:04,010 --> 02:07:04,569
Of course we are.

1503
02:07:18,890 --> 02:07:19,850
Let's go back.

1504
02:07:20,569 --> 02:07:34,109
Guys, your face came weird.

1505
02:07:36,189 --> 02:07:36,909
This is my face.

1506
02:07:37,710 --> 02:07:39,560
And you can say my face is weird.

1507
02:07:39,560 --> 02:07:41,720
I mean, rude.

1508
02:07:41,720 --> 02:07:43,960
But that's your opinion on how you feel about my face.

1509
02:07:46,220 --> 02:07:50,000
I also have an opinion that your opinion is...

1510
02:07:51,680 --> 02:07:53,630
No, let's just play.

1511
02:07:53,630 --> 02:07:55,789
Why is it so small?

1512
02:07:55,789 --> 02:07:56,189
It's not...

1513
02:07:56,189 --> 02:07:57,550
I want you to focus on the gameplay.

1514
02:08:01,279 --> 02:08:01,920
Definitely, foe.

1515
02:08:02,399 --> 02:08:06,359
I don't know, Sid.

1516
02:08:06,920 --> 02:08:09,710
It really depends on if you start hearing music or not

1517
02:08:09,710 --> 02:08:10,510
when we walk up here.

1518
02:08:11,069 --> 02:08:14,000
Do you hear it?

1519
02:08:16,279 --> 02:08:17,079
No?

1520
02:08:17,079 --> 02:08:18,640
They might be friends.

1521
02:08:23,770 --> 02:08:24,489
Yeah.

1522
02:08:24,489 --> 02:08:25,470
Let's go!

1523
02:08:49,689 --> 02:08:50,170
Damn!

1524
02:08:51,130 --> 02:09:04,199
Dude, you're blocking gameplay.

1525
02:09:04,199 --> 02:09:05,560
I am not blocking gameplay.

1526
02:09:05,560 --> 02:09:06,439
I'm going to purposefully spot.

1527
02:09:12,810 --> 02:09:15,050
Combat looks so fucking fun.

1528
02:09:16,029 --> 02:09:19,529
Combat is so freaking fun.

1529
02:09:20,250 --> 02:09:29,560
No, it actually is.

1530
02:09:31,689 --> 02:09:36,840
You're in the center of the screen.

1531
02:09:37,560 --> 02:09:38,840
I think I'm in a perfect spot.

1532
02:09:39,479 --> 02:09:43,159
This is right over the stuff down here.

1533
02:09:43,159 --> 02:09:44,039
I'm not blocking anything.

1534
02:09:47,210 --> 02:09:48,409
No sign of the Royalists.

1535
02:09:49,130 --> 02:09:51,130
Else for that matter.

1536
02:09:52,189 --> 02:09:56,489
It's too bloody even for this hour.

1537
02:09:56,489 --> 02:09:57,289
What do we do now?

1538
02:09:57,850 --> 02:09:59,899
First, we look for my scout.

1539
02:09:59,899 --> 02:10:00,779
You start here.

1540
02:10:00,779 --> 02:10:01,979
I'll circle around the back.

1541
02:10:02,779 --> 02:10:05,119
How do I let you know if I find him?

1542
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:06,890
Good question.

1543
02:10:08,220 --> 02:10:11,449
Shout?

1544
02:10:11,449 --> 02:10:11,949
Subtle.

1545
02:10:18,970 --> 02:10:23,050
The combat director of the game, Ryota Suzuki,

1546
02:10:23,689 --> 02:10:27,770
which, uh, Devil May Cry and Dragon's Dogma.

1547
02:10:27,770 --> 02:10:28,329
I'm curious.

1548
02:10:29,560 --> 02:10:31,960
You're like, wow, that combat looks really great.

1549
02:10:32,680 --> 02:10:33,880
Combat director of the game.

1550
02:10:35,119 --> 02:10:38,039
So the village can't be complete.

1551
02:10:38,039 --> 02:10:39,319
Very, very cool.

1552
02:10:40,600 --> 02:10:41,479
All right.

1553
02:10:41,479 --> 02:10:43,319
This looks like I have to pay attention here.

1554
02:10:49,680 --> 02:10:50,159
Very cool.

1555
02:10:50,159 --> 02:10:50,960
Very cool.

1556
02:10:50,960 --> 02:10:51,760
Very cool.

1557
02:10:51,760 --> 02:10:52,260
Okay.

1558
02:10:56,250 --> 02:10:56,890
I hear music.

1559
02:11:02,479 --> 02:11:03,600
That sounds like a child.

1560
02:11:04,720 --> 02:11:09,689
Everything all right?

1561
02:11:10,329 --> 02:11:11,119
It's all right.

1562
02:11:11,119 --> 02:11:12,239
We should play Dragon's Dogma sometime.

1563
02:11:12,239 --> 02:11:12,960
I'm not one of them.

1564
02:11:13,600 --> 02:11:14,560
My friend and I were.

1565
02:11:15,119 --> 02:11:16,010
I saw Sturve.

1566
02:11:16,010 --> 02:11:16,810
We did Imperial Army.

1567
02:11:16,810 --> 02:11:17,770
Sturve made a video on it.

1568
02:11:17,770 --> 02:11:18,489
We've come to help.

1569
02:11:18,489 --> 02:11:19,130
It's funny.

1570
02:11:19,130 --> 02:11:20,489
Do you know where your parents are?

1571
02:11:22,060 --> 02:11:24,300
In the church.

1572
02:11:25,100 --> 02:11:28,090
Then I'm going to find them and make sure they're safe.

1573
02:11:29,550 --> 02:11:31,630
Can you stay hidden here until then?

1574
02:11:32,350 --> 02:11:36,159
To the church then.

1575
02:11:36,159 --> 02:11:36,659
Go.

1576
02:11:37,199 --> 02:11:39,840
But not yet because I want to see if you have any, uh,

1577
02:11:40,720 --> 02:11:41,760
hidden gil anywhere.

1578
02:11:42,319 --> 02:11:55,680
I feel like it's a lot more urgent than this.

1579
02:11:56,479 --> 02:11:59,600
What is he doing over there?

1580
02:12:00,880 --> 02:12:03,609
Is he mocking this entire situation?

1581
02:12:04,409 --> 02:12:07,739
Just skipping around.

1582
02:12:08,460 --> 02:12:10,460
I think I don't think I missed nothing.

1583
02:12:19,130 --> 02:12:19,770
Stop skipping.

1584
02:12:19,770 --> 02:12:21,449
You're breaking my immersion.

1585
02:12:21,449 --> 02:12:22,010
The church.

1586
02:12:22,010 --> 02:12:22,409
I know.

1587
02:12:22,409 --> 02:12:23,449
I'm one step ahead of you.

1588
02:12:24,640 --> 02:12:25,140
True.

1589
02:12:25,600 --> 02:12:42,199
Can you speak in a British accent for that entire stream?

1590
02:12:42,840 --> 02:12:44,840
No, but 5,000 of you will leave.

1591
02:12:44,840 --> 02:12:45,880
You hate when I do that.

1592
02:12:45,880 --> 02:12:46,920
Everybody hates when I do that.

1593
02:12:47,479 --> 02:12:48,300
More than anything.

1594
02:12:55,479 --> 02:12:56,680
Everybody hates it.

1595
02:13:07,640 --> 02:13:10,439
This man's gonna die if we don't get into a healer.

1596
02:13:10,439 --> 02:13:12,359
Enough of your barking, dog!

1597
02:13:23,789 --> 02:13:25,390
That was fucking awesome.

1598
02:13:27,390 --> 02:13:27,949
Didn't even...

1599
02:13:29,149 --> 02:13:30,029
That was...

1600
02:13:30,029 --> 02:13:31,550
I loved that so much.

1601
02:13:34,510 --> 02:13:35,710
It was just right on cue.

1602
02:13:36,989 --> 02:13:39,390
Enough of your barking, dog.

1603
02:13:39,390 --> 02:13:39,890
Boom.

1604
02:13:40,430 --> 02:13:41,710
Not even a small second.

1605
02:13:41,710 --> 02:13:43,149
It was right when he was done talking.

1606
02:13:45,100 --> 02:13:46,220
Just right in the back of the head.

1607
02:13:54,250 --> 02:13:56,399
He's with me.

1608
02:13:56,399 --> 02:13:57,199
Is this everyone?

1609
02:13:58,060 --> 02:13:58,779
No.

1610
02:13:58,779 --> 02:14:00,060
There were others.

1611
02:14:00,060 --> 02:14:03,819
A pair of royalists came for the bearers just before you arrived.

1612
02:14:03,819 --> 02:14:05,020
Was a dominant among them?

1613
02:14:08,729 --> 02:14:09,449
Maybe.

1614
02:14:09,449 --> 02:14:11,289
It's not like you is old in a sign.

1615
02:14:22,840 --> 02:14:23,560
Oh, shit.

1616
02:14:28,699 --> 02:14:30,920
This is great.

1617
02:14:30,920 --> 02:14:32,119
We're just chasing this guy?

1618
02:14:32,840 --> 02:14:34,279
We actually have to chase this guy down.

1619
02:14:42,909 --> 02:14:43,470
Oh, shit.

1620
02:14:44,439 --> 02:14:46,199
The really good part of the song is starting.

1621
02:14:46,199 --> 02:14:47,479
That means I'm dead.

1622
02:14:47,479 --> 02:14:48,920
I'm dead in like 10 seconds.

1623
02:14:49,720 --> 02:14:51,819
I gotta run as fast as I fucking can.

1624
02:14:52,699 --> 02:14:57,840
As long as I don't hear those fucking trumpets, mate,

1625
02:14:57,840 --> 02:14:58,880
I'm gonna be just fine.

1626
02:15:23,600 --> 02:15:24,720
That big turkey leg.

1627
02:15:32,520 --> 02:15:33,479
Will you join me?

1628
02:15:35,399 --> 02:15:35,960
My thanks.

1629
02:15:38,119 --> 02:15:39,720
To our lady of the wind.

1630
02:15:40,359 --> 02:15:41,079
And the king.

1631
02:15:48,250 --> 02:15:50,329
Imperials drink this piss?

1632
02:15:50,329 --> 02:15:53,289
Well, it would go some way to explain their breath.

1633
02:15:56,989 --> 02:15:57,949
You are disgusting.

1634
02:15:58,750 --> 02:16:00,989
Everybody back nowadays were gross.

1635
02:16:00,989 --> 02:16:03,869
We had disgusting breath and smelly bodies.

1636
02:16:03,869 --> 02:16:04,750
We all smell.

1637
02:16:05,550 --> 02:16:12,729
And instead of killing them,

1638
02:16:12,729 --> 02:16:14,810
you lead the rats straight to us.

1639
02:16:15,369 --> 02:16:15,850
Mercy.

1640
02:16:18,649 --> 02:16:19,529
This poor guy.

1641
02:16:20,649 --> 02:16:22,649
This poor guy had to run into...

1642
02:16:22,649 --> 02:16:24,329
Oh, I feel bad for this guy.

1643
02:16:24,329 --> 02:16:25,449
That was just so...

1644
02:16:25,449 --> 02:16:26,329
That was so bad.

1645
02:16:28,109 --> 02:16:29,550
An imperial bearer.

1646
02:16:31,439 --> 02:16:33,440
But I was getting bored.

1647
02:16:43,559 --> 02:16:44,360
Recruited that guy.

1648
02:17:19,129 --> 02:17:22,729
What is that thing?

1649
02:17:22,729 --> 02:17:23,229
Torgl!

1650
02:17:27,290 --> 02:17:30,489
I have no potions.

1651
02:17:30,489 --> 02:17:31,690
I have to actually be really careful here.

1652
02:18:33,950 --> 02:18:34,450
Let's go!

1653
02:18:35,629 --> 02:18:57,579
I love ending it like that with a charged shot.

1654
02:18:57,579 --> 02:18:59,389
This feels so good.

1655
02:18:59,389 --> 02:19:10,879
You have the worst face cam out of any streamer I know.

1656
02:19:10,879 --> 02:19:12,319
Uh, all right.

1657
02:19:12,319 --> 02:19:22,809
This is a cam, whatever.

1658
02:19:37,069 --> 02:19:37,469
Turn it off.

1659
02:19:37,469 --> 02:19:38,510
They don't appreciate it.

1660
02:19:42,430 --> 02:19:44,670
Don't recall you complaining, Benedicta.

1661
02:19:51,739 --> 02:19:52,239
So.

1662
02:19:53,479 --> 02:19:54,360
Sedolphus.

1663
02:19:55,790 --> 02:19:56,989
Remind me.

1664
02:19:56,989 --> 02:19:59,229
Why was it that you betrayed your kingdom?

1665
02:20:02,680 --> 02:20:04,040
I asked you a question.

1666
02:20:05,079 --> 02:20:06,040
Lord Commander.

1667
02:20:06,760 --> 02:20:07,959
Why'd she keep saying that, Cid?

1668
02:20:08,600 --> 02:20:09,639
Cid, what's going on here?

1669
02:20:09,639 --> 02:20:10,360
Why?

1670
02:20:10,360 --> 02:20:14,510
Because I've had enough of you and your king's antics.

1671
02:20:17,260 --> 02:20:21,340
And yet here you are, stealing my branded.

1672
02:20:22,729 --> 02:20:23,690
What are you plotting?

1673
02:20:24,649 --> 02:20:26,250
As if I'd tell you.

1674
02:20:26,250 --> 02:20:27,850
This wasn't in the lore, check.

1675
02:20:27,850 --> 02:20:29,850
I looked at it before I even started hanging out with you.

1676
02:20:30,649 --> 02:20:32,299
Did you lie on your resume?

1677
02:20:33,020 --> 02:20:36,040
Lady Benedicta!

1678
02:20:36,040 --> 02:20:37,639
We have secured the dominant.

1679
02:20:43,000 --> 02:20:49,930
Who's that guy?

1680
02:20:50,729 --> 02:20:57,739
Okay!

1681
02:20:58,200 --> 02:20:59,840
That's Gav.

1682
02:20:59,840 --> 02:21:04,079
That's Cid's faithful scout who puts his legendary nose to work

1683
02:21:04,079 --> 02:21:06,079
in tracking the movements of slaver soldiers

1684
02:21:06,079 --> 02:21:08,559
and any other object of interest to the hideaway.

1685
02:21:09,520 --> 02:21:14,319
The ever-agreeable fellow only too gladly delving behind enemy lines

1686
02:21:14,319 --> 02:21:16,399
if he can get a good story out of it or two.

1687
02:21:16,399 --> 02:21:19,739
Okay, good, cool.

1688
02:21:19,739 --> 02:21:21,610
Let me just, remind me again.

1689
02:21:22,250 --> 02:21:24,059
Commander of the Kingdom of...

1690
02:21:24,059 --> 02:21:24,860
Okay.

1691
02:21:24,860 --> 02:21:31,389
All right, got it, got it.

1692
02:21:33,950 --> 02:21:43,149
Finally explaining the lore.

1693
02:21:43,149 --> 02:21:45,149
I told you last week when we played the demo.

1694
02:21:46,510 --> 02:21:48,510
I unironically think that is the best,

1695
02:21:48,510 --> 02:21:50,270
one of the best features of this game.

1696
02:21:52,909 --> 02:21:53,629
I want more of that.

1697
02:22:01,229 --> 02:22:02,799
Trust me.

1698
02:22:02,799 --> 02:22:10,459
Especially for a game that's, you know, you come back,

1699
02:22:10,459 --> 02:22:12,139
you jump back and forth, jump into it.

1700
02:22:13,319 --> 02:22:15,159
Sometimes I play a game and I'll come back a week or two later

1701
02:22:15,159 --> 02:22:17,239
and it's just like, I don't even know who the fuck any of these people are.

1702
02:22:18,040 --> 02:22:19,000
It's very helpful.

1703
02:22:19,000 --> 02:22:20,120
Unironically, I mean it.

1704
02:22:20,920 --> 02:22:30,360
So, it wasn't about bears at all.

1705
02:22:30,360 --> 02:22:31,639
They, unironically again.

1706
02:22:43,319 --> 02:22:44,360
Everyone with a brand.

1707
02:22:44,920 --> 02:22:46,760
And then everyone without one and all.

1708
02:22:47,000 --> 02:22:51,559
And locked you in the cellar, hoping sooner or later someone would break.

1709
02:22:57,549 --> 02:23:02,190
You know, things might have been different if you'd accepted my invitation.

1710
02:23:02,190 --> 02:23:03,389
Oh, don't remind us.

1711
02:23:03,389 --> 02:23:04,989
We were all saying the same thing.

1712
02:23:04,989 --> 02:23:06,190
This is our own, isn't it?

1713
02:23:06,989 --> 02:23:08,989
Don't mean we won't help when we can, though.

1714
02:23:08,989 --> 02:23:10,909
And that, I'll drink to.

1715
02:23:12,030 --> 02:23:15,690
I just wish one of them would keep dying.

1716
02:23:15,690 --> 02:23:17,129
Yes, I'll drink to that.

1717
02:23:17,129 --> 02:23:17,610
Because like,

1718
02:23:18,569 --> 02:23:21,549
Let's do something weird.

1719
02:23:22,110 --> 02:23:22,590
Like, who?

1720
02:23:28,569 --> 02:23:29,850
But people still think it was cool.

1721
02:23:56,110 --> 02:24:02,590
13 years ago, I watched the dominant kill my brother right in front of me.

1722
02:24:03,629 --> 02:24:05,239
And I did nothing.

1723
02:24:08,139 --> 02:24:09,100
But now I can.

1724
02:24:11,450 --> 02:24:13,129
I can kill the son of a bitch.

1725
02:24:14,670 --> 02:24:17,549
And bring peace to my brother's soul.

1726
02:24:19,920 --> 02:24:23,790
After that, whatever happens, happens.

1727
02:24:24,510 --> 02:24:30,920
Wait, you're content to be a slave, then?

1728
02:24:30,920 --> 02:24:41,100
That's what I'm saying.

1729
02:24:41,100 --> 02:24:41,659
That's what I was...

1730
02:24:42,700 --> 02:24:43,819
Like, Sid, there's nothing in that cup.

1731
02:24:44,620 --> 02:24:45,579
Sid, there's nothing in there.

1732
02:24:45,979 --> 02:24:47,979
That cup has been empty for like, 40 minutes.

1733
02:24:52,520 --> 02:24:53,399
He did the thing!

1734
02:24:53,399 --> 02:24:57,479
This radiance would have us believe the Imperial host invincible.

1735
02:24:59,450 --> 02:25:05,850
Yet here we find the Empire's cornerstone teetering on the backs of a handful of cowards and cutthroats.

1736
02:25:09,639 --> 02:25:12,440
While the Hamid may lead a hundred full legions.

1737
02:25:13,079 --> 02:25:18,600
Could it be that the young prince defends a house of cards ready to topple at the slightest breeze?

1738
02:25:18,600 --> 02:25:20,120
But I recognize that guy's voice.

1739
02:25:20,920 --> 02:25:22,280
He's in Game of Thrones.

1740
02:25:22,280 --> 02:25:24,680
Pretty big part in Game of Thrones.

1741
02:26:13,370 --> 02:26:13,870
Ow!

1742
02:26:14,489 --> 02:26:15,450
That's not a good...

1743
02:26:16,409 --> 02:26:18,409
You're literally, like, hurting me.

1744
02:26:18,409 --> 02:26:19,129
Why would I do that?

1745
02:26:35,579 --> 02:26:37,260
Why didn't you want to make it seem like this...

1746
02:26:37,260 --> 02:26:38,059
What you were doing was like...

1747
02:26:39,899 --> 02:26:40,780
Like, hey, I'm gonna...

1748
02:26:40,780 --> 02:26:42,940
By the way, here's like a full steak dinner.

1749
02:26:43,819 --> 02:26:48,010
And, like, you know, you want one of these swords?

1750
02:26:48,010 --> 02:26:48,889
We can make one for you.

1751
02:26:49,450 --> 02:26:51,600
What's your favorite movie?

1752
02:26:51,600 --> 02:26:53,600
That we can get it on an emblem on the handle for you?

1753
02:26:54,319 --> 02:26:55,690
Or your favorite play?

1754
02:26:55,690 --> 02:26:56,329
Whatever.

1755
02:26:56,329 --> 02:26:57,610
You know, what's your favorite book?

1756
02:27:07,229 --> 02:27:09,149
Yeah, I get pulp fiction on the emblem.

1757
02:27:09,149 --> 02:27:09,709
It's like the...

1758
02:27:37,129 --> 02:27:41,209
It's freaking Gav.

1759
02:27:43,129 --> 02:27:44,569
I hope Gav is a party member.

1760
02:27:46,010 --> 02:27:46,569
What about Gav?

1761
02:27:52,489 --> 02:27:52,989
Aww.

1762
02:27:56,329 --> 02:27:56,969
I like Gav.

1763
02:28:09,639 --> 02:28:13,770
I suppose I better scout ahead for any surprises.

1764
02:28:14,649 --> 02:28:17,559
Don't you let him down.

1765
02:28:18,360 --> 02:28:21,610
I won't.

1766
02:28:21,610 --> 02:28:24,350
Wait, we're sending him ahead because he has a...

1767
02:28:24,350 --> 02:28:25,950
He can smell things better than us.

1768
02:28:26,590 --> 02:28:27,629
Not so fast.

1769
02:28:28,270 --> 02:28:29,709
We wait until tomorrow.

1770
02:28:31,340 --> 02:28:32,139
He's right there.

1771
02:28:32,780 --> 02:28:36,780
And if we leave now, we'll arrive just as the sun comes up.

1772
02:28:36,780 --> 02:28:38,940
Maybe join the guards in breaking their fast.

1773
02:28:39,739 --> 02:28:41,020
Come on, Clive.

1774
02:28:41,020 --> 02:28:42,559
They only just took the place.

1775
02:28:43,120 --> 02:28:44,719
They'll be there a while yet.

1776
02:28:44,719 --> 02:28:47,520
I bet you cannot name Gav's accent.

1777
02:28:49,360 --> 02:28:49,840
Welsh.

1778
02:28:49,840 --> 02:28:50,159
Thank you.

1779
02:28:50,639 --> 02:28:51,360
What were you going to give me?

1780
02:28:52,159 --> 02:28:52,399
No.

1781
02:29:04,409 --> 02:29:05,129
Even close.

1782
02:29:05,770 --> 02:29:08,559
Dude, I'm very precise.

1783
02:29:09,200 --> 02:29:15,610
Okay, cool.

1784
02:29:17,360 --> 02:29:18,000
New stock.

1785
02:29:29,280 --> 02:29:31,290
Let me upgrade first.

1786
02:29:32,010 --> 02:29:37,790
Is there a blacksmith here?

1787
02:29:37,790 --> 02:29:39,149
There's a shop, but...

1788
02:29:42,780 --> 02:29:48,319
What do you got?

1789
02:29:48,319 --> 02:29:49,920
What can I interest you in today?

1790
02:29:50,639 --> 02:29:53,680
Give the best voice of the entire video again.

1791
02:29:54,239 --> 02:29:56,090
Can I get you to talk more?

1792
02:29:56,090 --> 02:29:57,290
Like, way more?

1793
02:29:57,290 --> 02:30:00,489
What does that get you to talk 10 times more than you already have, Button?

1794
02:30:03,200 --> 02:30:04,590
I have the longsword.

1795
02:30:05,549 --> 02:30:06,430
I need potions.

1796
02:30:07,229 --> 02:30:08,430
Yeah, I'm kind of out of these.

1797
02:30:09,530 --> 02:30:10,409
These are expensive.

1798
02:30:18,520 --> 02:30:19,559
Ah, yes.

1799
02:30:20,200 --> 02:30:23,610
I hope it's to your liking.

1800
02:30:25,469 --> 02:30:26,670
I trust it's all here.

1801
02:30:31,760 --> 02:30:32,399
Okay.

1802
02:30:32,399 --> 02:30:33,360
I don't need more than this.

1803
02:30:35,899 --> 02:30:37,739
$40,000.

1804
02:30:37,739 --> 02:30:38,379
What is this?

1805
02:30:40,989 --> 02:30:45,440
Adds a new song to the hideaways orchestrion.

1806
02:30:45,440 --> 02:30:46,319
40 grand?

1807
02:30:46,879 --> 02:30:48,809
Oh, that's a gold sink right there.

1808
02:30:49,930 --> 02:30:50,409
Good day.

1809
02:30:55,690 --> 02:30:56,969
I have like 3,000.

1810
02:30:57,530 --> 02:31:00,719
Quentin, my good man.

1811
02:31:00,719 --> 02:31:02,159
It seems we'll be spending the night.

1812
02:31:02,799 --> 02:31:04,079
I thought as much.

1813
02:31:04,639 --> 02:31:07,450
Where do you find that one?

1814
02:31:08,170 --> 02:31:09,659
What, him?

1815
02:31:09,659 --> 02:31:11,180
You won't believe me if I told you.

1816
02:31:13,840 --> 02:31:19,040
Quentin here is an old friend, one who is sympathetic to our cause.

1817
02:31:19,040 --> 02:31:20,799
Grind forward, or we riot.

1818
02:31:21,920 --> 02:31:23,840
And he knows about your little sanctuary.

1819
02:31:26,649 --> 02:31:29,770
I would never have guessed so many people were bent on setting us free.

1820
02:31:32,000 --> 02:31:35,840
When last I checked, the mere thoughtward only would trip to the gallows.

1821
02:31:37,629 --> 02:31:41,549
I am well aware of the risks, as I am of the rewards.

1822
02:31:45,260 --> 02:31:48,299
And what could be more rewarding than your very own dominant of fire?

1823
02:31:49,340 --> 02:31:50,459
A dominant?

1824
02:31:50,459 --> 02:31:50,860
Here?

1825
02:31:52,059 --> 02:31:54,059
Now that I would like to see.

1826
02:31:57,500 --> 02:31:58,379
Meaning you haven't.

1827
02:31:59,340 --> 02:32:02,139
No, but nothing passes unnoticed in Lostwing.

1828
02:32:02,139 --> 02:32:03,979
Take your brand, for example.

1829
02:32:11,629 --> 02:32:14,430
People will see that at once.

1830
02:32:16,079 --> 02:32:20,559
And I need hardly tell you how they will greet the inquiries of a bearer.

1831
02:32:22,219 --> 02:32:27,100
You are afraid your words will fall on deaf ears.

1832
02:32:28,459 --> 02:32:32,700
As they have ever since the moment you were marked.

1833
02:32:33,420 --> 02:32:34,739
Okay.

1834
02:32:38,860 --> 02:32:43,020
Happily, I can provide a solution to your dilemma.

1835
02:32:43,020 --> 02:32:44,700
As a favor to Cid, that is.

1836
02:32:50,120 --> 02:32:51,000
Take this.

1837
02:32:52,940 --> 02:32:56,700
You will find it has the uncanny power to loosen tongues.

1838
02:32:58,840 --> 02:32:59,479
Seal.

1839
02:32:59,479 --> 02:33:02,040
You accept the hanged man from Quentin?

1840
02:33:02,040 --> 02:33:03,639
May the mothers guide you.

1841
02:33:04,280 --> 02:33:14,879
This might be Imperial land, but here in Lostwing, it's his word that's law.

1842
02:33:15,600 --> 02:33:16,319
But how?

1843
02:33:17,659 --> 02:33:19,819
You don't need to worry about that just yet.

1844
02:33:19,819 --> 02:33:20,319
Trust me.

1845
02:33:20,940 --> 02:33:23,340
Everyone in Lostwing knows what that seal means.

1846
02:33:23,979 --> 02:33:25,899
And what it means if they don't take note.

1847
02:33:26,940 --> 02:33:33,280
We can sit here counting our blessings or put them to good use and find that dominant.

1848
02:33:33,920 --> 02:33:34,479
Your choice.

1849
02:33:35,840 --> 02:33:40,319
Hey, I guess I'll use it for finding the dominant.

1850
02:33:41,450 --> 02:33:43,450
Let's see if this thing really works.

1851
02:33:44,569 --> 02:33:47,389
Gather information from the villagers.

1852
02:33:47,389 --> 02:33:47,889
Okay.

1853
02:33:48,510 --> 02:33:53,319
But is it to walk up to them and be like, hey, what do you know?

1854
02:33:53,959 --> 02:33:56,219
That's all you can do.

1855
02:33:56,219 --> 02:33:59,000
All right.

1856
02:33:59,000 --> 02:33:59,479
What do you know?

1857
02:34:00,040 --> 02:34:05,520
Master Quentin took a liking to you, I see.

1858
02:34:06,239 --> 02:34:08,639
And there I was thinking you were in bed with Cid.

1859
02:34:09,360 --> 02:34:11,120
Wonder what Gav will have to say about this.

1860
02:34:11,840 --> 02:34:13,950
Speaking of whom.

1861
02:34:13,950 --> 02:34:14,450
What?

1862
02:34:15,069 --> 02:34:15,709
You see him.

1863
02:34:17,149 --> 02:34:19,469
Tell him thanks for looking after us.

1864
02:34:21,049 --> 02:34:23,309
Now, what can I help you with?

1865
02:34:24,110 --> 02:34:25,950
I'm searching for a dominant of fire.

1866
02:34:26,829 --> 02:34:29,069
Gav seems to think he might have taken refuge here.

1867
02:34:29,950 --> 02:34:32,170
We see a lot of bearers around these parts.

1868
02:34:33,129 --> 02:34:36,299
But I do seem to recall one who commanded the flame.

1869
02:34:36,940 --> 02:34:39,899
Now whether or not that makes him a dominant, I can't say.

1870
02:34:41,020 --> 02:34:44,159
But the Waludas certainly took a keen interest in the poor sod.

1871
02:34:44,799 --> 02:34:45,680
Did you go look at him?

1872
02:34:47,760 --> 02:34:48,559
Didn't have a chance.

1873
02:34:49,360 --> 02:34:51,200
One of the other bearers might have died.

1874
02:34:51,840 --> 02:34:52,319
Thank you.

1875
02:35:01,149 --> 02:35:01,649
Okay.

1876
02:35:03,129 --> 02:35:03,770
I don't know.

1877
02:35:08,879 --> 02:35:09,440
What is this?

1878
02:35:09,440 --> 02:35:10,319
What is this crystal?

1879
02:35:11,040 --> 02:35:19,899
That thing's kind of cool.

1880
02:35:23,629 --> 02:35:24,190
Get over here.

1881
02:35:24,190 --> 02:35:24,690
I can't.

1882
02:35:28,840 --> 02:35:33,680
This is a genuine laugh.

1883
02:35:34,239 --> 02:35:45,729
What do you know?

1884
02:35:47,549 --> 02:35:49,069
About a hanged man, I see.

1885
02:35:50,329 --> 02:35:52,329
Master Quentin must think you're important.

1886
02:35:52,889 --> 02:35:54,409
It was a good thing you done today.

1887
02:35:55,049 --> 02:35:56,409
Getting rid of those bastards.

1888
02:35:57,049 --> 02:35:58,329
If you hadn't come when you did,

1889
02:35:58,969 --> 02:36:00,649
I'd be on my way to Ashby now.

1890
02:36:01,610 --> 02:36:02,489
Along with the others.

1891
02:36:03,530 --> 02:36:04,329
Poor buggers.

1892
02:36:05,049 --> 02:36:07,770
These others, was there a dominant among them?

1893
02:36:07,770 --> 02:36:09,049
A dominant of fire?

1894
02:36:09,930 --> 02:36:11,209
Might have been, yeah.

1895
02:36:12,250 --> 02:36:14,170
Royalists seem to think there was, anyhow.

1896
02:36:14,170 --> 02:36:14,569
You know what?

1897
02:36:14,569 --> 02:36:20,329
I'm in an NPC dialogue with another NPC

1898
02:36:20,329 --> 02:36:23,209
and that character was the playable character coming to kill me.

1899
02:36:26,319 --> 02:36:27,600
Only that you weren't alone.

1900
02:36:28,319 --> 02:36:30,399
Was a young maid who went wherever he did.

1901
02:36:31,120 --> 02:36:32,079
Including the church.

1902
02:36:32,799 --> 02:36:35,760
And wherever the royalists dragged them both off to before you got here.

1903
02:36:36,319 --> 02:36:36,799
I see.

1904
02:36:37,680 --> 02:36:38,159
Thank you.

1905
02:36:38,719 --> 02:36:42,120
I wonder if Sid's found anything.

1906
02:36:42,120 --> 02:36:43,799
I want to bite your head right now.

1907
02:36:46,670 --> 02:36:47,549
I can relax.

1908
02:36:48,270 --> 02:36:56,569
All right, speak with Sid.

1909
02:36:57,370 --> 02:37:15,520
All right, I got info.

1910
02:37:15,520 --> 02:37:17,680
Tell me that scowl means you've got good news.

1911
02:37:21,159 --> 02:37:21,659
Sorry.

1912
02:37:27,149 --> 02:37:27,709
It's all right.

1913
02:37:27,709 --> 02:37:28,270
It's all right.

1914
02:37:28,270 --> 02:37:29,069
A shady lad.

1915
02:37:29,069 --> 02:37:29,950
Just relax.

1916
02:37:29,950 --> 02:37:30,750
Just relax.

1917
02:37:30,750 --> 02:37:32,350
And it's equally shady lass.

1918
02:37:33,149 --> 02:37:34,270
Not much to go on.

1919
02:37:34,989 --> 02:37:35,489
But.

1920
02:37:36,270 --> 02:37:36,770
But.

1921
02:37:38,239 --> 02:37:39,120
I've been thinking.

1922
02:37:39,680 --> 02:37:41,440
If our friend is a dominant,

1923
02:37:42,000 --> 02:37:44,000
why not just burn the royalists to a crisp?

1924
02:37:44,639 --> 02:37:46,239
There's a reason he's holding back.

1925
02:37:46,239 --> 02:37:47,760
Burn the royalists to a crisp?

1926
02:37:47,760 --> 02:37:49,520
I reckon it has something to do with his partner.

1927
02:37:49,520 --> 02:37:51,840
That's such a horrible way to...

1928
02:37:51,840 --> 02:37:55,200
One of the villagers I talked to said the two were separated.

1929
02:37:55,840 --> 02:37:57,360
If the Waludas have her,

1930
02:37:57,360 --> 02:38:00,319
our dominants like to think twice before starting any fires.

1931
02:38:00,959 --> 02:38:03,920
Whoever he is, he's shown himself to have a level head.

1932
02:38:04,639 --> 02:38:07,920
He's careful, cunning, and he doesn't want to be found.

1933
02:38:09,719 --> 02:38:13,309
This could spell trouble for us and the royalists both.

1934
02:38:16,159 --> 02:38:16,659
Still.

1935
02:38:17,360 --> 02:38:21,120
It'll be a whole lot worse if we set off after them with bleary eyes and empty bellies.

1936
02:38:21,680 --> 02:38:24,159
There should be a pair of pallets waiting for us back at the inn.

1937
02:38:25,040 --> 02:38:25,540
Shall we?

1938
02:38:26,799 --> 02:38:27,440
Let's do it.

1939
02:38:28,719 --> 02:38:31,280
Your party makeup has changed.

1940
02:38:40,600 --> 02:38:52,780
How come you're not skipping?

1941
02:38:52,780 --> 02:38:53,280
I...

1942
02:38:57,340 --> 02:38:58,059
I forgot.

1943
02:38:58,620 --> 02:39:08,430
I seem to recall your request being to spend the night.

1944
02:39:08,989 --> 02:39:11,870
And for that, the floor will more than suffice.

1945
02:39:12,670 --> 02:39:14,590
Better than a wet rock, I suppose.

1946
02:39:17,000 --> 02:39:18,200
My thanks, Quentin.

1947
02:39:19,000 --> 02:39:21,879
Next time you're at the hideaway, our floor's all yours.

1948
02:39:22,680 --> 02:39:24,120
No need for thanks, Sid.

1949
02:39:24,920 --> 02:39:26,920
This isn't an act of charity.

1950
02:39:27,639 --> 02:39:28,680
You don't say.

1951
02:39:28,680 --> 02:39:29,719
I do like the voice work, though.

1952
02:39:29,719 --> 02:39:33,639
In exchange for my floor, I shall be requiring your services.

1953
02:39:34,360 --> 02:39:36,360
Even like, the side characters are great.

1954
02:39:36,360 --> 02:39:39,559
...to barricade across the road south when they occupied the village.

1955
02:39:40,280 --> 02:39:42,360
And failed to remove it when they left.

1956
02:39:43,079 --> 02:39:45,079
I expect it to be gone before you leave.

1957
02:39:45,959 --> 02:39:46,760
As you wish.

1958
02:40:00,329 --> 02:40:01,290
Following evening.

1959
02:40:01,290 --> 02:40:02,250
Uh oh, we're not gonna get...

1960
02:40:02,969 --> 02:40:05,290
Well, that's all longer than expected.

1961
02:40:06,329 --> 02:40:08,090
First time dismantling a barricade?

1962
02:40:08,649 --> 02:40:09,450
It gets easier.

1963
02:40:09,450 --> 02:40:11,930
Dude wants a favor for letting somebody sleep on the floor?

1964
02:40:12,889 --> 02:40:16,170
If we leave now, we'll arrive at the care when the shadows are at the deepest.

1965
02:40:16,170 --> 02:40:16,889
Yeah, what the fuck?

1966
02:40:16,889 --> 02:40:17,610
Well, I should rather wait.

1967
02:40:18,329 --> 02:40:19,290
No more waiting.

1968
02:40:20,090 --> 02:40:24,239
The road's south end.

1969
02:40:25,340 --> 02:40:25,819
Unless...

1970
02:40:26,620 --> 02:40:27,819
I know of another shortcut.

1971
02:40:28,799 --> 02:40:29,840
You should be so lucky.

1972
02:40:30,479 --> 02:40:32,159
I have heels, right?

1973
02:40:32,159 --> 02:40:32,799
Yeah, I do.

1974
02:40:32,799 --> 02:40:33,840
I have a potion.

1975
02:40:33,840 --> 02:40:34,879
I have three?

1976
02:40:35,760 --> 02:40:37,600
Uh, the high potions over there?

1977
02:40:38,399 --> 02:40:48,719
Oh, yippee!

1978
02:40:51,399 --> 02:40:53,959
I'm gonna collect potions, and I'm gonna collect materials,

1979
02:40:53,959 --> 02:40:54,840
and I'm gonna get...

1980
02:40:54,840 --> 02:40:55,959
I'm gonna get status effects!

1981
02:40:56,760 --> 02:40:57,920
Just you wait!

1982
02:40:57,920 --> 02:40:58,719
Just you wait, Sid!

1983
02:41:06,940 --> 02:41:08,969
Everything all right?

1984
02:41:09,690 --> 02:41:19,209
Yup.

1985
02:41:19,209 --> 02:41:23,899
If the royalists were looking to take the care

1986
02:41:23,899 --> 02:41:27,020
that have posted centuries to prevent any unwelcome surprises,

1987
02:41:27,659 --> 02:41:28,700
at least I would have.

1988
02:41:29,850 --> 02:41:31,770
Well, you should know.

1989
02:41:46,270 --> 02:41:48,270
Make for Care Norvent.

1990
02:41:52,000 --> 02:41:52,639
Five bucks?

1991
02:41:59,850 --> 02:42:00,350
Let's go!

1992
02:42:02,559 --> 02:42:22,430
Wait.

1993
02:42:23,290 --> 02:42:26,139
I probably didn't even need to buy the potions now that I'm looking at it.

1994
02:42:26,860 --> 02:42:29,000
What are the royalists thinking?

1995
02:42:29,000 --> 02:42:31,870
Why take a stronghold they've no chance of holding?

1996
02:42:32,590 --> 02:42:34,350
When they've no intention of holding it,

1997
02:42:35,149 --> 02:42:37,319
the king is up to something.

1998
02:42:38,120 --> 02:42:38,620
The king?

1999
02:42:39,239 --> 02:42:41,709
Well, you don't think they're acting on a whim, do you?

2000
02:42:42,809 --> 02:42:45,370
This is one of his majesty's cunning stunts,

2001
02:42:46,090 --> 02:42:48,010
and he's sent his best to execute it.

2002
02:42:49,450 --> 02:42:49,950
Back over here.

2003
02:42:50,889 --> 02:42:51,389
Item.

2004
02:42:58,569 --> 02:43:00,889
Two pinches of magicked ash.

2005
02:43:02,399 --> 02:43:02,899
Ooh!

2006
02:43:03,600 --> 02:43:04,239
What is this?

2007
02:43:05,840 --> 02:43:07,389
This is like a super chest.

2008
02:43:08,030 --> 02:43:17,280
Did I get a lore check?

2009
02:43:17,280 --> 02:43:18,159
I had to shave.

2010
02:43:18,159 --> 02:43:18,659
Yeah.

2011
02:43:21,200 --> 02:43:23,040
We're going to Care Norvent.

2012
02:43:23,600 --> 02:43:26,079
It's an imperial stronghold located along the southern fringes

2013
02:43:26,639 --> 02:43:30,000
of Sambricoi's territory,

2014
02:43:30,000 --> 02:43:32,799
far from its capital of Oriflame.

2015
02:43:34,170 --> 02:43:35,209
Shatter was wondering.

2016
02:43:35,209 --> 02:43:38,170
It occupies a key strategic position adjacent to the Crystal Belt,

2017
02:43:38,809 --> 02:43:42,170
and it's suitably formatively fortified as a result.

2018
02:43:42,170 --> 02:43:43,930
Within its walls there are living quarters,

2019
02:43:43,930 --> 02:43:46,809
a church, a jail, and sufficient storehouses

2020
02:43:46,809 --> 02:43:49,290
to see the occupants through the lengthy siege.

2021
02:43:49,290 --> 02:43:50,170
Hope you had a good shave.

2022
02:44:29,879 --> 02:44:32,559
You're going to do another Halloween week this year?

2023
02:44:32,559 --> 02:44:33,440
Yeah, of course.

2024
02:44:34,159 --> 02:44:40,059
Play at least a few scary games.

2025
02:44:40,059 --> 02:44:41,180
There's quite a few that have come out.

2026
02:44:48,799 --> 02:44:51,120
All right, check over here.

2027
02:44:51,840 --> 02:44:59,000
Can't go this way?

2028
02:44:59,639 --> 02:45:00,139
No?

2029
02:45:03,180 --> 02:45:04,139
He won't do it now.

2030
02:45:04,139 --> 02:45:04,940
He just said he would.

2031
02:45:04,940 --> 02:45:05,659
Now he won't do it.

2032
02:45:08,040 --> 02:45:11,479
You should wear a cardigan again for Halloween week.

2033
02:45:11,479 --> 02:45:12,120
All right, hold on.

2034
02:45:13,239 --> 02:45:13,879
Getting attacked.

2035
02:45:33,479 --> 02:45:34,760
Oh, I should have jumped up there.

2036
02:45:36,360 --> 02:45:39,629
Level 14?

2037
02:45:40,510 --> 02:45:55,579
Can you do a minus two stream where you tell bad jokes on purpose?

2038
02:45:57,340 --> 02:45:59,799
We did that three days ago.

2039
02:45:59,799 --> 02:46:01,159
I feel like I do that every other stream.

2040
02:46:05,760 --> 02:46:09,360
My plan for Halloween this year is to get a full elaborate vampire outfit.

2041
02:46:11,360 --> 02:46:11,860
I'm doing that.

2042
02:46:14,780 --> 02:46:21,659
I'm going to be in character the whole night.

2043
02:46:24,520 --> 02:46:28,120
I'm going to pretend like it's 1100 or something.

2044
02:46:29,000 --> 02:46:30,680
When do vampires rain?

2045
02:46:30,680 --> 02:46:31,180
I don't remember.

2046
02:46:33,719 --> 02:46:34,520
Well, they didn't ever.

2047
02:46:36,040 --> 02:46:37,159
When are vampires supposed to exist?

2048
02:46:52,799 --> 02:46:54,159
Somebody said 2008.

2049
02:47:26,030 --> 02:47:27,229
Fourteen hundreds.

2050
02:47:27,229 --> 02:47:27,729
Okay.

2051
02:47:44,059 --> 02:47:45,659
Wear a cardigan as the vampire?

2052
02:47:46,139 --> 02:47:48,540
The best and worst decision I ever made.

2053
02:47:48,540 --> 02:47:53,770
Your estimator, Clive.

2054
02:47:53,770 --> 02:47:57,040
A fight with her icon is not one you're likely to walk away from.

2055
02:47:57,979 --> 02:48:02,059
Garuda, warden of the wind.

2056
02:48:02,059 --> 02:48:07,899
Yeah, I'll just drink like a bottle of wine on stream.

2057
02:48:09,020 --> 02:48:13,389
Let's play scary games.

2058
02:48:27,229 --> 02:48:28,030
New location.

2059
02:48:36,719 --> 02:48:42,120
I think this is that part in the demo.

2060
02:48:42,120 --> 02:48:42,840
Is that correct?

2061
02:48:42,840 --> 02:48:44,680
This seems like the place for it.

2062
02:48:44,680 --> 02:48:45,879
I think this is the part from the demo.

2063
02:48:47,870 --> 02:48:48,370
Yeah, it is.

2064
02:49:05,700 --> 02:49:06,979
The land has fallen.

2065
02:49:10,129 --> 02:49:12,930
The eastern territories all but belong to the orcs.

2066
02:49:14,219 --> 02:49:16,139
I'll have my men ready to depart by noon.

2067
02:49:16,139 --> 02:49:16,780
Don't bother.

2068
02:49:17,739 --> 02:49:19,760
But what of the mines?

2069
02:49:19,760 --> 02:49:23,040
Without Adamantite, the light would have engulfed the mines ere long.

2070
02:49:24,319 --> 02:49:27,520
Besides, you already have your orders.

2071
02:49:29,790 --> 02:49:31,149
Yes, my liege.

2072
02:49:31,149 --> 02:49:35,870
The dark swallows more of the realm with each passing day.

2073
02:49:36,510 --> 02:49:40,110
The land starved of the ether that gives it life.

2074
02:49:40,110 --> 02:49:46,190
And as the fringes fade, the people flock to the mother crystals desperate for their blessing.

2075
02:49:47,149 --> 02:49:50,639
For we wage for possession of that blessing.

2076
02:49:51,520 --> 02:49:56,159
It breaks us from within, hastening us to our own destruction.

2077
02:49:56,719 --> 02:49:59,840
And so you do what must be done.

2078
02:50:01,069 --> 02:50:06,110
I unite the dominance that we may bring an end to the strife

2079
02:50:06,750 --> 02:50:10,590
and found a new order to see us unto tomorrow.

2080
02:50:10,590 --> 02:50:16,379
The world must be restored and I will see it so.

2081
02:50:16,379 --> 02:50:19,100
You might have already had Sedolphus not betrayed us.

2082
02:50:19,100 --> 02:50:19,600
Last fight.

2083
02:50:21,469 --> 02:50:22,110
Him again.

2084
02:50:23,069 --> 02:50:24,989
Lost you still for his embrace.

2085
02:50:26,510 --> 02:50:29,340
But worse not.

2086
02:50:30,700 --> 02:50:31,579
My liege.

2087
02:50:33,940 --> 02:50:36,579
I serve you and you alone.

2088
02:50:37,700 --> 02:50:45,200
I remember well the day you first entered these halls.

2089
02:50:47,860 --> 02:50:52,260
Your pale hand pressed into his as if it would never let go.

2090
02:50:52,260 --> 02:50:55,579
That that was a long time ago.

2091
02:50:56,780 --> 02:51:01,020
Sometimes it's like, hey, man, you're going to like play Breath of the Wild like next week.

2092
02:51:10,110 --> 02:51:19,309
Soon my hand that is that keeps them from falling into the darkness.

2093
02:51:20,620 --> 02:51:21,739
Hold me, my liege.

2094
02:51:22,620 --> 02:51:23,579
Never let me go.

2095
02:51:35,790 --> 02:51:37,069
That scared the shit out of me.

2096
02:51:37,069 --> 02:51:40,750
Well, our sentries has failed to report, my lady, your orders.

2097
02:51:40,750 --> 02:51:43,149
Pull the men back inside their care, Geralt.

2098
02:51:43,149 --> 02:51:44,030
He is here, then.

2099
02:51:45,059 --> 02:51:48,100
Have them lead Sid and his little pet to the chapel.

2100
02:51:48,739 --> 02:51:50,340
I shall entertain them there.

2101
02:51:58,590 --> 02:52:00,190
So you've come for me after all.

2102
02:52:03,149 --> 02:52:04,030
Yes, I have.

2103
02:52:08,270 --> 02:52:09,790
Yeah, this is the demo part.

2104
02:52:10,670 --> 02:52:12,350
Well, the part of the extra demo.

2105
02:52:26,049 --> 02:52:27,250
Yep, this is the same part.

2106
02:52:34,290 --> 02:52:34,850
Headwind.

2107
02:52:41,500 --> 02:52:42,989
To teach me some time.

2108
02:52:45,260 --> 02:52:47,340
Oh, yeah, I forgot how do I turn this back on?

2109
02:52:47,340 --> 02:52:50,299
Remember, I had to turn the brightness up on my game because I didn't know how to turn it back on.

2110
02:52:54,540 --> 02:52:55,500
I was like, I can't see.

2111
02:52:56,139 --> 02:52:58,340
We should start with the dungeons.

2112
02:52:58,340 --> 02:53:06,260
Where is that?

2113
02:53:06,260 --> 02:53:08,479
Oh, yeah.

2114
02:53:08,479 --> 02:53:10,030
In here.

2115
02:53:16,129 --> 02:53:17,010
They're all empty.

2116
02:53:18,110 --> 02:53:20,340
And you're going to give up.

2117
02:53:24,190 --> 02:53:31,360
Sid, this gate needs some help.

2118
02:53:32,700 --> 02:53:34,540
We just cast a headache curse on me.

2119
02:53:35,180 --> 02:53:35,899
Let me help you here.

2120
02:53:39,899 --> 02:53:40,620
Should be gone now.

2121
02:53:48,299 --> 02:53:49,500
I did my I did my best.

2122
02:53:49,500 --> 02:53:58,139
You made it worse.

2123
02:54:02,530 --> 02:54:09,139
Oh, you just made me dumber.

2124
02:54:11,780 --> 02:54:12,659
No, you don't.

2125
02:54:12,659 --> 02:54:14,100
You can't even prove that, by the way.

2126
02:54:14,100 --> 02:54:14,819
Did you hear that?

2127
02:54:15,379 --> 02:54:16,739
What are you in the middle of a math test?

2128
02:54:18,500 --> 02:54:19,540
Now you just don't know how to do it.

2129
02:54:26,799 --> 02:54:27,299
Hi.

2130
02:54:37,149 --> 02:54:37,790
Kind of loud.

2131
02:54:37,790 --> 02:54:38,110
I know.

2132
02:54:38,110 --> 02:54:39,790
But I mean, you got to get pumped up, right?

2133
02:54:39,790 --> 02:54:40,750
You got to get pumped up.

2134
02:54:53,819 --> 02:54:54,780
Oh, that was cool.

2135
02:55:02,399 --> 02:55:03,760
Where to next?

2136
02:55:06,370 --> 02:55:06,850
I don't know.

2137
02:55:06,850 --> 02:55:07,489
Ask the dog.

2138
02:55:09,950 --> 02:55:10,590
Wait, let me check it.

2139
02:55:10,590 --> 02:55:12,909
I don't want to miss anything.

2140
02:55:32,739 --> 02:55:34,579
This door only leads to more Royalists.

2141
02:55:35,299 --> 02:55:35,860
We can take them.

2142
02:55:35,860 --> 02:55:36,579
Find another one.

2143
02:55:36,579 --> 02:55:37,139
We can take them.

2144
02:55:38,930 --> 02:55:39,729
Oh, snap.

2145
02:55:39,729 --> 02:55:42,610
It's the goofy guy I keep seeing on my YouTube feed.

2146
02:55:46,879 --> 02:55:47,760
Welcome to the stream.

2147
02:55:48,399 --> 02:55:55,069
Hope you enjoy your stay.

2148
02:56:01,379 --> 02:56:02,979
OK, now here's how I actually am.

2149
02:56:21,819 --> 02:56:24,430
Well, we found the Imperial garrison.

2150
02:56:25,940 --> 02:56:27,459
Right where the Royalists left.

2151
02:56:27,700 --> 02:57:58,260
I feel like I'm one of those living, like, AI paintings.

2152
02:57:58,260 --> 02:58:02,510
The ones that's like, oh, look, we can make grandpa blink.

2153
02:58:02,510 --> 02:58:03,469
You know what I mean?

2154
02:58:03,469 --> 02:58:22,780
The ones that are like, they're everywhere.

2155
02:58:22,780 --> 02:58:23,840
Let's go.

2156
02:58:35,659 --> 02:58:38,219
Get them all in the same zone.

2157
02:58:38,219 --> 02:58:39,020
Is it zero?

2158
02:58:39,020 --> 02:58:39,899
The same zero?

2159
02:58:43,620 --> 02:58:48,059
I think so.

2160
02:58:55,149 --> 02:58:55,649
You.

2161
02:58:56,290 --> 02:58:56,790
You.

2162
02:58:57,010 --> 02:58:57,649
You're the healer.

2163
02:58:57,649 --> 02:58:58,209
You need to die.

2164
02:58:58,850 --> 02:59:02,799
That was cool.

2165
02:59:03,600 --> 02:59:08,440
All right.

2166
02:59:08,440 --> 02:59:08,920
Can you heal me?

2167
02:59:08,920 --> 02:59:09,799
Because I don't want to use a potion.

2168
02:59:10,440 --> 02:59:16,040
I really don't want to use a potion.

2169
02:59:16,040 --> 02:59:16,440
I don't know.

2170
02:59:16,440 --> 02:59:16,920
Whatever.

2171
02:59:16,920 --> 02:59:17,479
I'll use them.

2172
02:59:17,479 --> 02:59:17,979
Fine.

2173
02:59:28,149 --> 02:59:35,430
Oh, bloody hide.

2174
02:59:36,719 --> 02:59:37,680
Bloody fangs.

2175
02:59:47,079 --> 02:59:48,360
Thanks for the...

2176
03:00:24,500 --> 03:00:25,459
Oh, shit.

2177
03:00:26,260 --> 03:00:39,760
And then one big one.

2178
03:00:40,319 --> 03:00:41,860
And then one of these.

2179
03:00:43,219 --> 03:00:44,090
There we go.

2180
03:00:45,110 --> 03:00:57,139
Oh, you went fast.

2181
03:00:58,020 --> 03:01:15,479
God damn it.

2182
03:01:15,479 --> 03:01:16,360
I keep forgetting he does that.

2183
03:01:39,120 --> 03:01:39,620
Kill.

2184
03:01:40,319 --> 03:01:42,120
All right.

2185
03:01:42,120 --> 03:01:43,079
I need to heal.

2186
03:01:43,799 --> 03:01:59,540
Would you consider yourself a junk food streamer?

2187
03:01:59,540 --> 03:02:00,739
Can you sing Billie Jean?

2188
03:02:11,729 --> 03:02:12,409
That one?

2189
03:02:20,120 --> 03:02:23,319
Oh, do Billie Jean without without any emotion at all?

2190
03:02:23,319 --> 03:02:23,819
Sure.

2191
03:02:30,180 --> 03:02:46,729
After them.

2192
03:02:55,239 --> 03:02:55,959
Well guarded.

2193
03:02:55,959 --> 03:02:59,079
Attacking the opponent from the front while his guarding will deal no damage.

2194
03:02:59,079 --> 03:03:00,819
Go to the back.

2195
03:03:00,819 --> 03:03:05,620
Hey, yeah, they can break through.

2196
03:03:06,260 --> 03:03:06,760
Yep.

2197
03:03:08,280 --> 03:03:08,780
Okay.

2198
03:03:31,729 --> 03:03:32,850
New enemies approach.

2199
03:04:09,139 --> 03:04:09,639
Four.

2200
03:04:17,219 --> 03:04:18,020
Caster, hold on.

2201
03:04:41,280 --> 03:04:42,159
I'm hungry.

2202
03:04:42,159 --> 03:04:42,799
Well, you should.

2203
03:04:43,440 --> 03:04:43,940
Get a snack.

2204
03:04:52,260 --> 03:04:53,139
You didn't even do the...

2205
03:04:56,209 --> 03:04:56,709
Now I did.

2206
03:05:05,620 --> 03:05:10,360
Don't miss a chest or anything.

2207
03:05:10,360 --> 03:05:10,840
I don't want to...

2208
03:05:10,840 --> 03:05:11,340
Yeah, see?

2209
03:05:12,200 --> 03:05:14,000
I don't want to miss anything.

2210
03:05:21,809 --> 03:05:22,850
I got some pizza here.

2211
03:05:22,850 --> 03:05:23,569
You want a slice?

2212
03:05:24,209 --> 03:05:24,930
Oh, I'm good.

2213
03:05:25,569 --> 03:05:27,590
What kind of pizza though is it?

2214
03:05:28,229 --> 03:05:28,729
Pepperoni?

2215
03:05:43,530 --> 03:05:54,180
What the hell?

2216
03:05:54,180 --> 03:05:56,340
A little late for prayer, isn't it?

2217
03:05:56,340 --> 03:06:02,069
Do I seem so desperate as to grovel at the feet of a false god?

2218
03:06:02,069 --> 03:06:04,309
This is gonna be much harder because I don't have all the things...

2219
03:06:04,309 --> 03:06:06,069
I was waiting for you.

2220
03:06:06,069 --> 03:06:07,350
All the accessories were on last time.

2221
03:06:07,350 --> 03:06:08,149
For too long, I hope.

2222
03:06:10,760 --> 03:06:12,360
All this for a midnight chat?

2223
03:06:15,059 --> 03:06:16,819
Well, let's chat then.

2224
03:06:17,639 --> 03:06:19,719
Where are the men and women you took from Lostwing?

2225
03:06:20,280 --> 03:06:21,799
You mean where's the dominant?

2226
03:06:22,520 --> 03:06:25,159
Well, Luke shall be requiring his services indefinitely.

2227
03:06:26,739 --> 03:06:28,899
Come back to me, Sedulphus.

2228
03:06:28,899 --> 03:06:29,620
I need you.

2229
03:06:30,180 --> 03:06:32,500
Think of all the things we can create together.

2230
03:06:34,120 --> 03:06:35,879
The world that we can build.

2231
03:06:36,600 --> 03:06:37,719
You need me?

2232
03:06:39,659 --> 03:06:41,420
Your king needs me.

2233
03:06:41,420 --> 03:06:43,180
I'm all for building a new world.

2234
03:06:44,219 --> 03:06:45,180
Just not his.

2235
03:06:45,979 --> 03:06:49,579
That bastard's dreams are as twisted as his promises are false.

2236
03:06:50,379 --> 03:06:52,379
And I want no part of him.

2237
03:06:52,379 --> 03:06:56,379
King Barnabas saved you, and this is how you speak of him.

2238
03:06:56,459 --> 03:06:58,139
Have you no shred of loyalty?

2239
03:06:59,559 --> 03:07:00,620
What?

2240
03:07:00,620 --> 03:07:02,139
To a leader who'd use me?

2241
03:07:03,479 --> 03:07:04,600
Like he uses you?

2242
03:07:05,559 --> 03:07:07,959
You know nothing of me, Sedulphus.

2243
03:07:07,959 --> 03:07:08,520
You're right.

2244
03:07:09,639 --> 03:07:13,180
I don't know who you are anymore, or what you want.

2245
03:07:15,659 --> 03:07:17,420
I only know what you used to say.

2246
03:07:19,129 --> 03:07:20,649
That you were tired of running.

2247
03:07:22,649 --> 03:07:24,889
That you just wanted to be free.

2248
03:07:24,889 --> 03:07:25,690
Free of it all.

2249
03:07:27,020 --> 03:07:28,940
You weren't lying to me then, so what changed?

2250
03:07:30,420 --> 03:07:33,379
What made you think you had to sacrifice who you were

2251
03:07:33,379 --> 03:07:34,500
to get what you wanted?

2252
03:07:35,879 --> 03:07:36,680
Sacrifice?

2253
03:07:37,319 --> 03:07:39,399
I used my talent to my advantage,

2254
03:07:39,399 --> 03:07:41,319
and you would tell me there is shame in that?

2255
03:07:41,319 --> 03:07:45,639
If there's no shame, then why do you feel so sorry for yourself?

2256
03:07:45,639 --> 03:07:47,639
Arousing speech, Lord Commander.

2257
03:07:48,520 --> 03:07:51,079
I was a fool to believe you might have changed.

2258
03:07:52,040 --> 03:07:55,000
The only person I feel sorry for is you!

2259
03:07:57,959 --> 03:07:59,319
I can't do this anymore.

2260
03:08:06,069 --> 03:08:09,350
If you would stand between our leash and his dream,

2261
03:08:10,579 --> 03:08:12,100
then you leave me no choice.

2262
03:08:14,069 --> 03:08:14,950
You're gonna do about it.

2263
03:08:14,950 --> 03:08:15,909
Goodbye, Sedulphus.

2264
03:08:28,090 --> 03:08:28,489
I'm back.

2265
03:08:28,489 --> 03:08:29,610
Did I miss anything?

2266
03:08:29,610 --> 03:09:00,889
And don't forget about what I can do.

2267
03:09:01,610 --> 03:09:02,889
I can get rid of your headaches.

2268
03:09:05,860 --> 03:09:06,659
Keep going, Sid!

2269
03:09:07,299 --> 03:09:10,899
I'll make sure you're clean of all pain in your upper region.

2270
03:09:11,700 --> 03:09:15,659
You are gonna wake up with fresh tomorrow.

2271
03:09:16,459 --> 03:09:30,489
Head's not gonna hurt.

2272
03:09:30,489 --> 03:09:44,309
I'm just the migraine medicine guy.

2273
03:09:44,309 --> 03:09:45,350
I don't want any part of this.

2274
03:09:45,989 --> 03:09:46,629
Finish them.

2275
03:09:47,190 --> 03:09:49,780
I don't even know how to use a sword.

2276
03:09:49,860 --> 03:09:50,340
I, uh...

2277
03:09:55,559 --> 03:09:59,000
Well, Sid, the beast is not three against one.

2278
03:10:11,610 --> 03:10:12,170
Watch out.

2279
03:10:46,379 --> 03:10:47,579
Cinematic evasion.

2280
03:10:48,299 --> 03:10:55,079
Oh, they crashed into each other.

2281
03:10:55,079 --> 03:10:56,200
I didn't even pick that up last time.

2282
03:11:02,659 --> 03:11:03,219
Get in here!

2283
03:11:03,780 --> 03:11:43,540
All right, this one's done.

2284
03:12:04,229 --> 03:12:04,729
Shit!

2285
03:12:05,350 --> 03:12:05,850
Sorry.

2286
03:12:08,500 --> 03:12:09,620
Okay, I'm getting hurt.

2287
03:12:14,360 --> 03:12:14,860
Shit.

2288
03:12:53,719 --> 03:12:54,840
8K, that's not bad.

2289
03:13:06,440 --> 03:13:06,940
Shit.

2290
03:13:07,579 --> 03:13:32,040
How come you look really interesting today?

2291
03:13:32,040 --> 03:13:32,920
I think it's just...

2292
03:13:32,920 --> 03:13:42,590
I have a beard I haven't shaved.

2293
03:13:42,590 --> 03:13:44,190
Mom instincts kicked in?

2294
03:13:49,690 --> 03:13:50,809
Mom instincts?

2295
03:13:51,610 --> 03:14:08,040
We're not done.

2296
03:14:12,239 --> 03:14:12,739
Sid.

2297
03:14:15,690 --> 03:14:16,569
Do I look all right?

2298
03:14:19,200 --> 03:14:29,600
Does he actually make it?

2299
03:14:29,600 --> 03:14:33,069
I mean, in the demo, doesn't it kind of just end?

2300
03:14:33,069 --> 03:14:37,520
Benedict II will be on her way to collect the Domain if she hasn't already.

2301
03:14:40,200 --> 03:14:41,959
You can't afford to let them leave.

2302
03:14:42,520 --> 03:14:44,600
Remember, she has wings, you don't.

2303
03:14:45,559 --> 03:14:46,200
What about you?

2304
03:14:47,659 --> 03:14:49,180
Before or after I catch my breath?

2305
03:14:50,590 --> 03:14:51,090
Sorry.

2306
03:14:56,780 --> 03:14:57,500
Come on, Toggle.

2307
03:14:58,459 --> 03:15:08,840
Oh, he is...

2308
03:15:08,840 --> 03:15:10,040
Yeah, he is there at the end of the demo.

2309
03:15:12,569 --> 03:15:15,799
Okay, let's keep going.

2310
03:15:27,280 --> 03:15:28,000
Give him a potion?

2311
03:15:28,559 --> 03:15:29,200
Oh, they're mine.

2312
03:15:30,600 --> 03:15:37,899
He had a lot of opportunities to go to the store and buy three high potions just like I did.

2313
03:15:38,700 --> 03:15:40,299
Wait, they might be just over here.

2314
03:15:40,940 --> 03:15:53,719
She must be here somewhere.

2315
03:15:55,319 --> 03:16:07,260
Yeah, I'll just throw this over at the favor of fire.

2316
03:16:07,260 --> 03:16:07,819
What was that?

2317
03:16:08,700 --> 03:16:14,489
Did I just get something?

2318
03:16:14,489 --> 03:16:23,149
What was that?

2319
03:16:23,149 --> 03:16:36,270
Oh, forget about the defense.

2320
03:16:36,270 --> 03:16:45,600
Let's put these both on.

2321
03:16:45,600 --> 03:16:46,959
I'm going to open the other door that was down here.

2322
03:16:47,520 --> 03:16:55,159
Can you equip the dog too?

2323
03:16:55,159 --> 03:16:57,319
I don't believe so.

2324
03:16:57,959 --> 03:16:58,680
I don't believe so.

2325
03:16:59,239 --> 03:17:00,360
At least not at the moment.

2326
03:17:00,360 --> 03:17:01,159
I'm not sure maybe later.

2327
03:17:10,329 --> 03:17:10,729
Good.

2328
03:17:10,729 --> 03:17:11,229
Meteorite.

2329
03:17:17,760 --> 03:17:21,360
We want to go this way.

2330
03:17:21,360 --> 03:17:22,559
You need to equip Otto.

2331
03:17:39,899 --> 03:17:42,700
Kind of sounded like Homer Simpson, didn't it?

2332
03:17:44,139 --> 03:17:45,100
For like one second.

2333
03:17:46,219 --> 03:17:55,659
I need to get rid of you.

2334
03:18:05,469 --> 03:18:06,030
You too.

2335
03:18:06,030 --> 03:18:06,590
You need to die.

2336
03:18:36,860 --> 03:18:37,340
Good dog.

2337
03:18:38,200 --> 03:18:42,270
Any more Cheshire Trests?

2338
03:18:42,270 --> 03:18:59,440
How do I get over there?

2339
03:19:00,000 --> 03:19:02,750
How do I get over there?

2340
03:19:05,399 --> 03:19:10,959
How do I get over there?

2341
03:19:20,219 --> 03:19:22,139
How lazy wants us gone before sunrise?

2342
03:19:48,920 --> 03:19:50,120
Oh, this is okay.

2343
03:19:50,120 --> 03:19:51,079
You go down from here.

2344
03:19:51,719 --> 03:20:00,430
Is there anywhere else to go?

2345
03:20:03,520 --> 03:20:04,559
I don't think so.

2346
03:20:05,280 --> 03:20:07,290
Can you pronounce something funny?

2347
03:20:07,290 --> 03:20:07,850
Give me a word.

2348
03:20:08,649 --> 03:20:09,530
Give me a word to pronounce.

2349
03:20:28,540 --> 03:20:29,420
Lobster.

2350
03:20:29,420 --> 03:20:30,000
There you go.

2351
03:20:33,979 --> 03:20:34,860
Oh, hold on.

2352
03:20:37,979 --> 03:20:39,819
All right, get everybody near the table.

2353
03:20:40,700 --> 03:20:42,329
I didn't hit anybody.

2354
03:20:42,889 --> 03:20:50,040
Oh, you got a good one.

2355
03:20:50,840 --> 03:20:58,440
Shit.

2356
03:21:20,569 --> 03:21:34,379
Oh, my hair's getting in the way.

2357
03:21:35,100 --> 03:21:42,059
Starting to like this game more and more.

2358
03:21:43,260 --> 03:21:45,280
It's just it's fun to play.

2359
03:21:45,280 --> 03:21:46,159
It's fun to play.

2360
03:21:46,959 --> 03:21:49,979
My mom made macaroni and cheese.

2361
03:21:51,020 --> 03:21:51,520
Pog.

2362
03:21:52,299 --> 03:22:04,829
This won't be easy.

2363
03:22:05,629 --> 03:22:08,559
Get him.

2364
03:22:08,559 --> 03:22:14,000
That fire breathing gets me a little like.

2365
03:22:15,680 --> 03:23:35,639
It's the first video game you ever played.

2366
03:23:36,680 --> 03:23:38,360
Super Mario Brothers for the NES.

2367
03:23:40,729 --> 03:23:42,090
Super Mario Brothers for the NES.

2368
03:23:42,649 --> 03:23:45,790
First game I really ever played.

2369
03:23:45,790 --> 03:23:48,829
Same, yeah.

2370
03:23:50,600 --> 03:23:51,479
I remember because.

2371
03:23:52,600 --> 03:23:56,120
So me and my siblings would play and we were terrible at it.

2372
03:23:56,120 --> 03:23:57,639
You've heard this story before.

2373
03:23:57,639 --> 03:23:58,600
That's lame.

2374
03:23:58,600 --> 03:24:01,239
All right, time that person up for fucking six weeks.

2375
03:24:01,879 --> 03:24:05,149
All right, so I've told the story before.

2376
03:24:05,709 --> 03:24:07,389
So siblings and I would.

2377
03:24:08,270 --> 03:24:10,989
So my dad would be like, all you got to do.

2378
03:24:11,950 --> 03:24:15,950
You just get to Bowser with five lives and I'll beat it.

2379
03:24:16,590 --> 03:24:18,350
He's like, as long as you get to the end of the game.

2380
03:24:18,350 --> 03:24:20,590
As long as you get to Bowser with at least five lives, I'll beat it.

2381
03:24:21,450 --> 03:24:24,969
And we would be desperately just trying to get to the end of the game with five lives.

2382
03:24:24,969 --> 03:24:26,649
Because we couldn't beat Bowser, but he could.

2383
03:24:29,600 --> 03:24:31,920
And he'd be like, Dad, Dad, we got six lives.

2384
03:24:31,920 --> 03:24:34,079
And he'd be like, all right, let me get in there.

2385
03:24:35,040 --> 03:24:38,319
And he'd die like five times in a row, but he would actually do it.

2386
03:24:38,319 --> 03:24:39,280
He would do it every time.

2387
03:24:40,000 --> 03:24:43,290
Good memories.

2388
03:24:46,719 --> 03:24:52,569
Because my dad knew that if we didn't have at least four or five lives.

2389
03:24:54,329 --> 03:24:57,100
Oh, I don't know if he's confident on doing it.

2390
03:25:15,469 --> 03:25:17,069
Oh, get your dad.

2391
03:25:17,790 --> 03:25:21,979
Yeah, we'd be cheering.

2392
03:25:21,979 --> 03:25:24,059
It'd be like, yeah, he did it.

2393
03:25:24,059 --> 03:25:25,180
He beat Bowser.

2394
03:25:25,180 --> 03:25:26,299
And he would just be like, that's right.

2395
03:25:27,020 --> 03:25:32,489
Okay, I'm going to pay attention.

2396
03:25:32,489 --> 03:25:37,559
What door did I knock on?

2397
03:25:37,559 --> 03:25:39,799
I just opened like five doors and I don't know where I'm going.

2398
03:25:40,440 --> 03:25:42,840
Okay, it's this one.

2399
03:25:42,840 --> 03:25:59,840
What are you going to do?

2400
03:26:03,180 --> 03:26:16,010
You coming?

2401
03:26:16,010 --> 03:26:29,479
How's the job going?

2402
03:26:30,200 --> 03:26:31,319
Start with off brand.

2403
03:26:31,319 --> 03:26:32,520
It's going awesome.

2404
03:26:32,760 --> 03:26:35,000
I'm starting to work on some projects.

2405
03:26:35,000 --> 03:26:37,399
I'm going to get some, you know, writing days in.

2406
03:26:38,200 --> 03:26:38,840
It's going great.

2407
03:26:38,840 --> 03:26:39,879
I'm really, really happy.

2408
03:26:40,600 --> 03:26:46,620
Trying to get the workflow, you know, different days that I'm going to be doing stuff and

2409
03:26:47,659 --> 03:26:49,899
meetings, meetings, meetings.

2410
03:26:50,540 --> 03:26:52,969
Is Ludwig a good boss?

2411
03:26:52,969 --> 03:26:56,170
Oh, yeah, I would say Ludwig is a great boss.

2412
03:26:56,809 --> 03:27:11,760
I confess I expected more from the old man and less from you.

2413
03:27:11,760 --> 03:27:14,639
This is the second time you've bested my sisters.

2414
03:27:16,399 --> 03:27:18,479
Men of your talents are rare indeed.

2415
03:27:18,479 --> 03:27:19,440
Did you get a new planner?

2416
03:27:19,440 --> 03:27:21,920
Why waste your lot with such undesirables?

2417
03:27:21,920 --> 03:27:27,360
If it is the hearth you long for, you will find more than enough warmth under my wings.

2418
03:27:29,239 --> 03:27:30,680
You know exactly what I want.

2419
03:27:32,360 --> 03:27:35,159
Hand over the dominant and I'll leave you in peace.

2420
03:27:36,280 --> 03:27:38,760
You would dare to make demands of me?

2421
03:27:39,959 --> 03:27:42,940
Know your place, little lamb.

2422
03:27:44,459 --> 03:27:48,139
Fool is the shepherd who heats every bleat of the flock.

2423
03:27:49,850 --> 03:27:52,889
And I will suffer yours no longer.

2424
03:27:55,610 --> 03:27:57,129
Must I spell it out for you?

2425
03:27:57,129 --> 03:28:02,250
See how the chief creative officer of off-brand does in this boss battle.

2426
03:28:04,170 --> 03:28:09,799
To the slaughter with you.

2427
03:28:11,159 --> 03:28:12,040
You brought it up.

2428
03:28:12,040 --> 03:28:12,680
I'm just.

2429
03:28:14,600 --> 03:28:15,559
Let's go.

2430
03:28:16,280 --> 03:28:37,760
That hurt a lot.

2431
03:29:12,940 --> 03:29:13,819
Oh, I don't have anything.

2432
03:29:15,530 --> 03:29:16,030
Yeah.

2433
03:29:54,750 --> 03:29:55,469
Headache on.

2434
03:30:19,950 --> 03:30:34,010
Cry all you.

2435
03:30:34,010 --> 03:30:37,739
There's no one to save you now.

2436
03:30:43,979 --> 03:31:11,239
Oh, it hurt.

2437
03:31:11,239 --> 03:31:28,879
Just charge it, charge it, charge it.

2438
03:31:29,520 --> 03:31:38,129
This time.

2439
03:31:53,360 --> 03:31:53,860
Shit.

2440
03:32:11,899 --> 03:32:12,399
Hold up.

2441
03:32:13,020 --> 03:32:19,149
3k, that's nothing.

2442
03:32:19,950 --> 03:32:51,450
Ram will fall.

2443
03:32:54,409 --> 03:32:57,000
I always press the L1.

2444
03:33:02,190 --> 03:33:13,819
Oh, go.

2445
03:33:59,610 --> 03:34:00,409
Oh, shit.

2446
03:34:00,409 --> 03:34:01,049
What does this mean?

2447
03:35:01,530 --> 03:35:02,569
Deadly embrace.

2448
03:35:05,850 --> 03:35:08,969
I will say it's much more difficult without the accessories on.

2449
03:35:09,690 --> 03:35:18,399
Come on, dog.

2450
03:35:19,040 --> 03:35:27,260
Get her.

2451
03:35:36,559 --> 03:35:56,819
Go.

2452
03:36:48,670 --> 03:36:49,950
Get her, Torgo.

2453
03:36:49,950 --> 03:36:50,450
Get her.

2454
03:36:51,770 --> 03:36:52,809
Shit, I'm in a combo.

2455
03:36:53,770 --> 03:37:17,469
Okay, we're good.

2456
03:37:18,430 --> 03:37:26,000
I thought it was crazy.

2457
03:37:33,719 --> 03:37:34,920
So this is as far as we've seen.

2458
03:37:56,760 --> 03:37:57,559
What's the difficulty?

2459
03:37:58,760 --> 03:37:59,479
The action.

2460
03:37:59,479 --> 03:38:00,440
There's two difficulties.

2461
03:38:01,239 --> 03:38:02,920
This story and action.

2462
03:38:02,920 --> 03:38:04,280
We've played your games.

2463
03:38:04,920 --> 03:38:06,110
I'm on action.

2464
03:38:06,110 --> 03:38:07,870
Tell me where he is.

2465
03:38:11,309 --> 03:38:11,809
Where are you?

2466
03:38:26,809 --> 03:38:29,370
What are you doing?

2467
03:38:30,010 --> 03:38:58,120
Why, why did you do that?

2468
03:39:13,159 --> 03:39:25,790
What the fuck?

2469
03:39:25,790 --> 03:39:26,590
Enough of this.

2470
03:39:29,790 --> 03:39:31,229
Oh.

2471
03:39:36,190 --> 03:39:36,909
I took it.

2472
03:39:40,379 --> 03:39:42,700
Now you really are only useful with birthday parties.

2473
03:39:46,299 --> 03:39:47,260
She's gone.

2474
03:39:47,260 --> 03:40:01,819
Give her back.

2475
03:40:05,840 --> 03:40:10,989
Or is she?

2476
03:40:12,090 --> 03:40:13,129
Where is Garuda?

2477
03:40:19,440 --> 03:40:21,709
Have you done?

2478
03:40:21,709 --> 03:40:25,920
Did you hear?

2479
03:40:27,360 --> 03:40:34,909
What the hell is going on?

2480
03:40:47,200 --> 03:40:47,920
Her power.

2481
03:40:49,549 --> 03:40:50,909
You took it from her.

2482
03:40:51,549 --> 03:40:53,420
How'd you do that?

2483
03:40:53,420 --> 03:40:54,459
And I'll take yours too.

2484
03:40:56,399 --> 03:40:57,520
You don't cut the shit.

2485
03:40:58,940 --> 03:41:01,180
That magical purple electricity.

2486
03:41:01,180 --> 03:41:03,159
I hope the bearers found a way out.

2487
03:41:03,159 --> 03:41:03,879
Looked cool.

2488
03:41:04,680 --> 03:41:09,069
This place is ready to collapse.

2489
03:41:11,600 --> 03:41:14,120
If your dominance started this fire,

2490
03:41:14,120 --> 03:41:15,159
and I'm betting he did.

2491
03:41:19,659 --> 03:41:24,729
What the hell is going on?

2492
03:41:25,530 --> 03:41:27,260
I thought that was us for a second.

2493
03:41:28,219 --> 03:41:29,340
We did not make it.

2494
03:41:29,340 --> 03:41:30,139
We didn't make it.

2495
03:41:31,319 --> 03:41:32,600
Oh boy, that's bad.

2496
03:41:33,479 --> 03:41:35,799
That's a bad thing for us to cut into being killed.

2497
03:41:36,440 --> 03:41:39,819
What was that?

2498
03:41:39,819 --> 03:41:45,450
I created a diversion as commanded, your grace.

2499
03:41:46,010 --> 03:41:48,620
The villagers escaped in the confusion.

2500
03:41:48,620 --> 03:41:50,729
As should we.

2501
03:41:51,530 --> 03:41:52,409
Yes.

2502
03:41:52,409 --> 03:41:57,899
Cutscene isn't over.

2503
03:41:57,899 --> 03:41:58,940
Basecam boy.

2504
03:42:08,280 --> 03:42:34,110
Yeah, I could do some upgrades.

2505
03:42:34,110 --> 03:42:34,909
I have a lot of points.

2506
03:42:34,909 --> 03:42:35,469
Come on.

2507
03:42:35,469 --> 03:42:37,760
If the catcher's leaving a burning care,

2508
03:42:37,760 --> 03:42:41,149
people might jump to conclusions.

2509
03:42:41,149 --> 03:42:45,370
Right.

2510
03:42:45,370 --> 03:42:46,409
Wings of change.

2511
03:42:50,829 --> 03:42:52,750
How can we remove basecam for cutscenes?

2512
03:42:53,389 --> 03:42:54,829
It makes it easier to pay attention to.

2513
03:42:55,469 --> 03:42:59,309
So you don't watch me pull boogers out of my nose and sneeze and stuff.

2514
03:42:59,950 --> 03:43:02,729
The power of wind.

2515
03:43:02,729 --> 03:43:06,569
Clive has claimed a portion of the icon Garuda's Essence.

2516
03:43:06,569 --> 03:43:10,809
Tuning with Garuda not only changes the elemental aspect of Clive's magic spells,

2517
03:43:10,809 --> 03:43:13,770
but also allows access to several new iconic abilities,

2518
03:43:13,770 --> 03:43:17,370
such as Gouge, a deadly flurry of talons

2519
03:43:17,370 --> 03:43:20,809
that can tear into an opponent for multiple hits.

2520
03:43:20,809 --> 03:43:24,219
Ability details can be found in the abilities tab in the main menu.

2521
03:43:24,219 --> 03:43:26,159
Garuda's Feet.

2522
03:43:26,159 --> 03:43:28,719
Garuda's iconic feat, Deadly Embrace,

2523
03:43:28,719 --> 03:43:32,559
can be used to draw smaller, lighter enemies toward Clive.

2524
03:43:32,559 --> 03:43:36,219
The action can also topple larger enemies and that, you know,

2525
03:43:36,219 --> 03:43:39,819
become partially staggered when their will gauge reaches 50%.

2526
03:43:40,700 --> 03:43:44,270
Toppling an enemy in this manner can deal significant damage.

2527
03:43:44,270 --> 03:43:45,870
So use it wisely.

2528
03:43:45,870 --> 03:43:48,040
This is called Deadly Embrace.

2529
03:43:48,920 --> 03:44:01,799
By the way, press L2 to cycle between currently attuned icons in real time,

2530
03:44:01,799 --> 03:44:04,379
allowing for more varied assault.

2531
03:44:04,379 --> 03:44:08,159
Cool down times for iconic abilities are displayed around the corresponding icon

2532
03:44:08,159 --> 03:44:09,680
in the ability widget.

2533
03:44:09,680 --> 03:44:12,639
Ability availability for all attuned icons can be confirmed.

2534
03:44:12,639 --> 03:44:16,440
Let me go like this.

2535
03:44:18,040 --> 03:44:25,920
So I have Deadly Embrace as this like hole.

2536
03:44:25,920 --> 03:44:26,959
I can feel it.

2537
03:44:26,959 --> 03:44:28,680
Okay, I'm back.

2538
03:44:29,239 --> 03:44:32,299
Inside me, the flames.

2539
03:44:32,299 --> 03:44:33,420
Gouge and Wicked Wheel.

2540
03:44:34,379 --> 03:44:38,440
Of course I want to try it out.

2541
03:44:38,440 --> 03:44:43,680
Of course I want to try it out.

2542
03:44:43,680 --> 03:44:44,559
Let's try it on these people.

2543
03:45:16,639 --> 03:45:17,520
Pretty cool.

2544
03:45:29,120 --> 03:45:30,299
Come here!

2545
03:45:32,110 --> 03:45:55,760
What do you got?

2546
03:45:56,299 --> 03:45:57,100
That's not going to help you.

2547
03:45:58,059 --> 03:46:03,579
Hey, I think you'd like the Final Fantasy 16 battle theme.

2548
03:46:03,579 --> 03:46:08,540
I think so.

2549
03:46:09,180 --> 03:46:20,239
Thank God you have CC now.

2550
03:46:22,040 --> 03:46:22,680
It's helpful.

2551
03:46:23,479 --> 03:46:24,280
The pole is helpful.

2552
03:46:28,000 --> 03:46:35,680
All right, we got a big dragon thing here.

2553
03:46:38,059 --> 03:46:58,719
Oh my goodness.

2554
03:46:58,719 --> 03:46:59,760
Oh my God, I forgot how to play.

2555
03:47:00,559 --> 03:47:19,549
What is the actual just default magic with this leg?

2556
03:47:20,110 --> 03:47:20,610
Pretty cool.

2557
03:47:42,430 --> 03:47:48,030
7K.

2558
03:47:48,989 --> 03:48:09,489
You watch the Smurfs movie yet?

2559
03:48:09,489 --> 03:48:11,379
Nope, I will.

2560
03:48:11,379 --> 03:48:12,420
I will this weekend.

2561
03:48:12,420 --> 03:48:18,670
You have Lego hair?

2562
03:48:18,670 --> 03:48:19,069
That's fine.

2563
03:48:19,629 --> 03:48:22,270
I don't want to move it because it'll...

2564
03:48:27,020 --> 03:48:27,659
I don't want to touch it.

2565
03:48:28,219 --> 03:48:29,979
If I touch it, I screwed up.

2566
03:48:29,979 --> 03:48:34,299
I need to go upgrade my weapon.

2567
03:48:34,860 --> 03:48:41,180
I have materials to upgrade this.

2568
03:48:41,739 --> 03:48:48,590
Don't just avoid all the items.

2569
03:48:48,590 --> 03:48:56,180
Five bucks.

2570
03:48:59,440 --> 03:49:02,530
Okay, let's take a look.

2571
03:49:02,530 --> 03:49:03,170
Abilities.

2572
03:49:04,129 --> 03:49:06,209
Garuda Channeled.

2573
03:49:06,850 --> 03:49:11,229
All right, this is where I got to figure out what I want to do.

2574
03:49:11,790 --> 03:49:16,510
Because there's at least three plus icons in the game.

2575
03:49:16,510 --> 03:49:22,239
There's at least three.

2576
03:49:22,239 --> 03:49:22,959
What is this one?

2577
03:49:27,360 --> 03:49:27,840
I don't know.

2578
03:49:29,920 --> 03:49:31,040
I like the pole.

2579
03:49:37,729 --> 03:49:39,090
I like the slashes.

2580
03:49:39,090 --> 03:49:39,729
It's gouged.

2581
03:49:49,059 --> 03:49:53,579
This is good too.

2582
03:49:53,579 --> 03:49:57,569
What's down here?

2583
03:49:57,569 --> 03:50:01,379
I use this a lot.

2584
03:50:01,379 --> 03:50:03,709
I use this a lot.

2585
03:50:03,709 --> 03:50:06,260
I use this a lot.

2586
03:50:06,260 --> 03:50:12,290
I use this a lot.

2587
03:50:12,290 --> 03:50:15,459
Does the pole just upgrade the damage?

2588
03:50:15,459 --> 03:50:16,500
Ah, that's a good question.

2589
03:50:20,370 --> 03:50:24,819
Range.

2590
03:50:24,819 --> 03:50:30,459
Looks like range?

2591
03:50:30,459 --> 03:50:31,659
Range is pretty good.

2592
03:50:31,659 --> 03:50:33,260
I'll go with this.

2593
03:50:33,260 --> 03:50:33,899
I like this one.

2594
03:50:38,299 --> 03:50:39,420
Follow up strike speed.

2595
03:50:47,600 --> 03:50:49,520
Jump back then deliver a punishing counter.

2596
03:50:49,520 --> 03:50:52,879
If the jump evades an attack, counter potency is increased.

2597
03:50:52,879 --> 03:51:01,600
So is this just a regular dodge?

2598
03:51:02,159 --> 03:51:03,280
But backwards and then I press...

2599
03:51:03,840 --> 03:51:05,120
How do I do the move?

2600
03:51:05,120 --> 03:51:06,989
Or is it a new move?

2601
03:51:06,989 --> 03:51:12,940
I'm upgrading this.

2602
03:51:12,940 --> 03:51:13,659
I use it all the time.

2603
03:51:21,899 --> 03:51:27,340
All right, what do I got?

2604
03:51:27,340 --> 03:51:33,280
Is it a different ability?

2605
03:51:39,069 --> 03:51:39,629
It is.

2606
03:51:39,629 --> 03:51:46,399
Okay, I would probably replace this.

2607
03:51:46,399 --> 03:51:51,870
So I really want to try to evade with this thing.

2608
03:51:52,510 --> 03:51:55,420
So you want to go wham.

2609
03:51:56,219 --> 03:51:58,620
And if you get a perfect evade, it's way better.

2610
03:51:58,620 --> 03:52:00,239
What's the cooldown?

2611
03:52:01,040 --> 03:52:04,819
Hmm is very pretty.

2612
03:52:04,819 --> 03:52:05,540
It is very pretty.

2613
03:52:06,100 --> 03:52:14,479
I want to practice that move.

2614
03:52:14,479 --> 03:52:18,020
Cool stream.

2615
03:52:18,020 --> 03:52:19,379
You can use this in IRL.

2616
03:52:25,260 --> 03:52:26,139
Wait, Gav is here.

2617
03:52:38,510 --> 03:52:45,389
I didn't know Gav was going to show up.

2618
03:52:46,030 --> 03:52:48,670
I'm not going to...

2619
03:52:48,670 --> 03:52:49,709
I'm going to stop talking.

2620
03:52:54,239 --> 03:52:54,879
Who was it?

2621
03:52:55,680 --> 03:52:56,879
Good question.

2622
03:52:56,879 --> 03:52:58,319
Someone who didn't have their hands full

2623
03:52:58,319 --> 03:52:59,920
fighting a bloody harpy, I guess.

2624
03:53:01,120 --> 03:53:03,819
But what matters is they're safe.

2625
03:53:04,780 --> 03:53:07,739
Something they wouldn't be had it not been for you, Gav.

2626
03:53:09,819 --> 03:53:11,579
Just doing my job like.

2627
03:53:12,379 --> 03:53:15,649
So what about his dominant?

2628
03:53:16,290 --> 03:53:16,790
Gone.

2629
03:53:17,409 --> 03:53:18,770
And after we were so close.

2630
03:53:19,329 --> 03:53:23,309
I can track him.

2631
03:53:24,430 --> 03:53:25,879
Who are you?

2632
03:53:26,819 --> 03:53:28,899
Sir told us about your family.

2633
03:53:29,860 --> 03:53:32,540
Lost mewing to imperial steel.

2634
03:53:33,420 --> 03:53:35,819
Sometimes vengeance is the only thing that keeps you going.

2635
03:53:35,819 --> 03:53:37,180
I'm biting my lip off camera.

2636
03:53:37,180 --> 03:53:37,680
I know.

2637
03:53:38,299 --> 03:53:39,659
You would be scolding me if you knew it.

2638
03:53:39,659 --> 03:53:40,700
Go safely, brothers.

2639
03:53:41,819 --> 03:53:46,159
Raggedy likes you.

2640
03:53:47,040 --> 03:53:58,479
She's gone.

2641
03:53:59,040 --> 03:53:59,979
She's gone.

2642
03:54:00,540 --> 03:54:03,299
My lady, you have to hold on.

2643
03:54:03,299 --> 03:54:03,940
We're going to get you.

2644
03:54:03,940 --> 03:54:04,659
Gone, gone, gone, gone.

2645
03:54:05,700 --> 03:54:10,340
What am I going to do?

2646
03:54:14,780 --> 03:54:16,299
How long to the coastal road?

2647
03:54:17,180 --> 03:54:19,180
At this pace, we won't make it by sunset.

2648
03:54:20,139 --> 03:54:23,340
No, he'll cost me up like all the others.

2649
03:54:24,459 --> 03:54:25,709
What am I going to do?

2650
03:54:26,590 --> 03:54:27,549
What am I going to do?

2651
03:54:27,549 --> 03:54:28,030
My lady.

2652
03:54:28,030 --> 03:54:28,909
Just pretend you still have it.

2653
03:54:29,469 --> 03:54:31,069
Oh, my God.

2654
03:54:31,069 --> 03:54:32,030
What the fuck?

2655
03:54:34,690 --> 03:54:40,459
I was waiting to see what that guy's story was,

2656
03:54:40,459 --> 03:54:41,739
but we're not going to get it anymore.

2657
03:54:42,700 --> 03:54:53,149
I thought that was going to be a major boss battle,

2658
03:54:53,149 --> 03:54:54,030
but no, he's just gone.

2659
03:54:54,030 --> 03:54:54,750
What are we out here?

2660
03:54:54,750 --> 03:54:55,250
Goodbye.

2661
03:54:55,250 --> 03:54:59,739
Thank you.

2662
03:54:59,739 --> 03:55:01,379
Jerov.

2663
03:55:01,379 --> 03:55:05,219
Second in command of Wayload's Royal Intelligencers.

2664
03:55:05,299 --> 03:55:07,549
Serving under Benedicta Harmon.

2665
03:55:07,549 --> 03:55:10,909
Killed by footpads while attempting to evacuate

2666
03:55:10,909 --> 03:55:14,909
the stricken Benedicta from the collapsing we just got.

2667
03:55:14,909 --> 03:55:18,860
This is just what happened to him right now.

2668
03:55:18,860 --> 03:55:20,139
This is the eulogy.

2669
03:55:21,709 --> 03:55:30,459
This is like the two sentence of what just happened to this guy.

2670
03:55:30,459 --> 03:55:31,979
Wiki page updated.

2671
03:55:31,979 --> 03:55:33,020
That's so funny.

2672
03:55:38,379 --> 03:55:39,260
What does this one say?

2673
03:55:41,360 --> 03:55:43,569
Huh?

2674
03:55:43,569 --> 03:55:49,520
No more powers.

2675
03:55:49,520 --> 03:55:52,399
Her love for former Lord Commander Sid

2676
03:55:52,399 --> 03:55:55,600
was deep and true and left an equally abyssal hole

2677
03:55:55,600 --> 03:56:00,379
in her heart when he fled Wayload.

2678
03:56:00,379 --> 03:56:01,659
Just pretend you still have the powers.

2679
03:56:03,340 --> 03:56:04,219
Who's going to question you?

2680
03:56:04,219 --> 03:56:06,940
We'll be doing the slavers of this service

2681
03:56:06,940 --> 03:56:09,739
if we didn't appraise our worth.

2682
03:56:10,860 --> 03:56:11,420
Stay away.

2683
03:56:30,690 --> 03:56:31,329
It's all right.

2684
03:56:33,170 --> 03:56:34,850
They can't hurt you anymore.

2685
03:56:34,850 --> 03:56:46,270
Let's go home.

2686
03:56:46,270 --> 03:57:00,000
Is this at Sotophis' punishment for not listening to you?

2687
03:57:06,270 --> 03:57:10,479
This wretched world.

2688
03:57:12,000 --> 03:57:17,739
Still got power?

2689
03:57:40,620 --> 03:57:40,940
Huh?

2690
03:58:03,200 --> 03:58:03,520
No.

2691
03:58:03,520 --> 03:58:04,479
Do we not have the power?

2692
03:58:08,319 --> 03:58:08,639
Sid.

2693
03:58:09,360 --> 03:58:12,420
Do you feel it too?

2694
03:58:21,260 --> 03:58:22,219
By the flames.

2695
03:58:22,219 --> 03:58:33,629
The harvest is hungry.

2696
03:58:33,629 --> 03:58:38,100
Been too much, Aether.

2697
03:58:38,739 --> 03:58:39,940
She can't control it.

2698
03:58:41,139 --> 03:58:42,719
Rude isn't stopped.

2699
03:58:42,719 --> 03:58:45,040
That vortex will swallow this whole forest

2700
03:58:45,040 --> 03:58:46,000
and us along with it.

2701
03:58:47,360 --> 03:58:48,719
And I'll stop her.

2702
03:58:48,719 --> 03:58:50,000
You'll stop her.

2703
03:58:50,000 --> 03:58:50,879
I heard it again.

2704
03:58:51,680 --> 03:58:52,639
Someone is calling me.

2705
03:58:53,440 --> 03:58:54,559
Come in, lad.

2706
03:58:54,559 --> 03:58:56,079
That doesn't mean you have to listen.

2707
03:58:57,520 --> 03:58:58,799
Well, I should have gone with you.

2708
03:58:59,920 --> 03:59:00,239
Yeah.

2709
03:59:02,139 --> 03:59:03,739
Best character in the whole franchise.

2710
03:59:04,700 --> 03:59:09,790
Okay.

2711
03:59:09,790 --> 03:59:11,629
Clyde, I don't think you understand.

2712
03:59:12,430 --> 03:59:14,829
That's not just windy weather you're wandering into.

2713
03:59:15,549 --> 03:59:17,870
Benedict's rage knows no bounds.

2714
03:59:18,510 --> 03:59:19,950
And that's on a good day.

2715
03:59:20,829 --> 03:59:22,930
I don't want to know what's waiting inside that.

2716
03:59:23,569 --> 03:59:24,290
But I do.

2717
03:59:25,250 --> 03:59:26,290
I have to find out.

2718
03:59:26,290 --> 03:59:27,090
That's all you have to say.

2719
03:59:27,090 --> 03:59:28,049
And I'm not turning back.

2720
03:59:28,049 --> 03:59:29,170
That's the only thing you have to say is,

2721
03:59:29,170 --> 03:59:30,770
I don't care where we're going.

2722
03:59:30,770 --> 03:59:31,010
Okay.

2723
03:59:31,969 --> 03:59:40,209
What is this?

2724
03:59:40,209 --> 03:59:48,500
There are so many.

2725
03:59:49,620 --> 03:59:53,309
I won for every fragment of our mind.

2726
03:59:53,309 --> 03:59:54,110
I'm just trying to get items.

2727
03:59:54,989 --> 04:00:01,709
Three bloody finds.

2728
04:00:02,430 --> 04:00:08,829
All right, let's go.

2729
04:00:13,020 --> 04:00:13,579
Yep.

2730
04:00:27,020 --> 04:00:28,059
Oh, that looks good.

2731
04:00:28,860 --> 04:00:34,219
I'm always late on that one.

2732
04:00:51,809 --> 04:00:52,370
Everybody in?

2733
04:00:53,409 --> 04:00:59,860
Have you learned the parry system?

2734
04:01:00,500 --> 04:01:01,299
I have.

2735
04:01:01,299 --> 04:01:03,299
But I'm a dodge Andy.

2736
04:01:04,180 --> 04:01:06,579
And I'm way more comfortable dodging frame.

2737
04:01:07,219 --> 04:01:11,780
Um, invulnerability frame thing than I am Barry.

2738
04:01:12,420 --> 04:01:15,219
It's cool that you can do it though.

2739
04:01:46,379 --> 04:02:02,639
And understandable.

2740
04:02:02,639 --> 04:02:03,360
Have a nice day.

2741
04:02:04,159 --> 04:02:04,399
What?

2742
04:02:05,040 --> 04:02:06,430
Have a nice day, I guess.

2743
04:02:07,149 --> 04:02:10,739
Barry is hard in this game.

2744
04:02:10,739 --> 04:02:13,059
It did feel like it was tricky to pull off.

2745
04:02:24,299 --> 04:02:24,540
Hi.

2746
04:02:58,690 --> 04:03:02,530
Oh, that was like perfect.

2747
04:03:03,489 --> 04:03:07,819
Wait, this is an item right here.

2748
04:03:08,459 --> 04:03:10,420
How long is the game?

2749
04:03:11,219 --> 04:03:11,940
That's a good question.

2750
04:03:15,090 --> 04:03:16,209
I want to say probably,

2751
04:03:18,799 --> 04:03:19,920
I don't think anyone's beaten it.

2752
04:03:19,920 --> 04:03:20,559
It came out today.

2753
04:03:21,760 --> 04:03:43,739
Let me try doing this move.

2754
04:03:43,739 --> 04:03:44,700
See if I can get it perfect.

2755
04:03:45,500 --> 04:03:49,250
It's not quite.

2756
04:04:18,959 --> 04:04:19,760
Sick of Torgl.

2757
04:04:20,399 --> 04:04:22,260
Yeah, we finally got to hear it.

2758
04:04:22,979 --> 04:04:25,069
All right, I want to get the item that was over here.

2759
04:04:25,709 --> 04:04:31,180
And do that thing with your face.

2760
04:04:31,180 --> 04:04:32,059
So what do you want to do?

2761
04:04:33,889 --> 04:04:34,129
This?

2762
04:04:43,579 --> 04:04:45,020
Yeah, thanks, dude.

2763
04:05:20,129 --> 04:05:27,280
You look a bit sloppy today.

2764
04:05:28,719 --> 04:05:30,479
I was, no, I was going to do something weird.

2765
04:05:37,280 --> 04:05:39,280
I feel like I'm having a dream watching this.

2766
04:05:39,280 --> 04:05:41,120
Why does I have a beard?

2767
04:05:49,250 --> 04:05:50,049
Oh, one of these things.

2768
04:05:50,690 --> 04:05:57,489
Who the hell are you?

2769
04:05:57,489 --> 04:05:58,209
Who the hell are you?

2770
04:06:00,510 --> 04:06:19,600
I feel like this is going to be a pretty,

2771
04:06:20,319 --> 04:06:22,559
it's going to be a milestone of the video game.

2772
04:06:22,559 --> 04:06:23,360
I think come on up here.

2773
04:06:25,040 --> 04:06:30,500
I am going to go back because I think it's time to upgrade.

2774
04:06:46,510 --> 04:06:47,629
Detour Danny.

2775
04:06:49,790 --> 04:06:53,950
I mean, yeah, I'm not going to go with just broken up shit weapons.

2776
04:06:54,590 --> 04:06:57,549
What do you got?

2777
04:07:03,379 --> 04:07:08,290
There's now a bastard sword.

2778
04:07:08,290 --> 04:07:12,610
So sell the bastard, sell the long sword by the bastard sword

2779
04:07:12,610 --> 04:07:18,370
and then upgrade the bastard sword.

2780
04:07:18,370 --> 04:07:25,090
It's a good sword for you.

2781
04:07:25,729 --> 04:07:30,670
It's okay to be scared of birds.

2782
04:07:30,670 --> 04:07:31,870
You can be, I love birds.

2783
04:07:32,510 --> 04:07:37,010
Do you know how badly I've wanted a bird to land on my finger?

2784
04:07:37,010 --> 04:07:39,489
Do you know how much I want that?

2785
04:07:39,489 --> 04:07:41,870
There's hummingbirds all over Vegas.

2786
04:07:41,870 --> 04:07:43,579
They're everywhere.

2787
04:07:43,579 --> 04:07:46,540
And I would like nothing more than to be able to put my hand out

2788
04:07:46,540 --> 04:07:50,219
and just Disney fucking princess have one land on my finger.

2789
04:07:50,860 --> 04:07:53,340
Do you understand how important that is to me?

2790
04:07:53,340 --> 04:07:55,180
Do you know how important that would be to me?

2791
04:07:55,819 --> 04:07:57,100
It'd be a huge deal.

2792
04:07:57,100 --> 04:07:57,979
It would change my whole life.

2793
04:07:57,979 --> 04:07:58,860
That would be life changing.

2794
04:07:58,860 --> 04:08:00,139
That would change my entire life.

2795
04:08:04,500 --> 04:08:06,659
I'm not, I ain't going to hear anybody tell me I'm afraid of birds.

2796
04:08:06,659 --> 04:08:07,459
Okay.

2797
04:08:07,459 --> 04:08:11,739
Do you even try?

2798
04:08:12,750 --> 04:08:14,750
Yeah, I have.

2799
04:08:14,750 --> 04:08:20,209
Do you know how many times I've thought like, wait, is today the day?

2800
04:08:20,209 --> 04:08:26,110
It's today the day because the outside and you'll hear them.

2801
04:08:26,110 --> 04:08:26,909
You'll hear them.

2802
04:08:28,350 --> 04:08:30,430
They sound like massive hornets.

2803
04:08:30,430 --> 04:08:32,510
So for the first spot, you have to be really aware of it.

2804
04:08:34,239 --> 04:08:40,430
Hummingbirds have been like, just kind of just hovering in front of me before.

2805
04:08:40,430 --> 04:08:48,079
It's just like, and they're gone.

2806
04:08:53,170 --> 04:08:58,219
I just, I just like did, I just did the guy's voice for one second.

2807
04:09:02,100 --> 04:09:02,500
Jeez.

2808
04:09:03,819 --> 04:09:04,379
All right.

2809
04:09:04,379 --> 04:09:05,100
We good.

2810
04:09:05,100 --> 04:09:08,540
Yeah. You know, how many times I've been just,

2811
04:09:09,340 --> 04:09:13,180
and I was imagining one landing and just doing this, doing this,

2812
04:09:13,180 --> 04:09:14,059
you know what I'm saying?

2813
04:09:14,059 --> 04:09:18,079
This, you know what I mean?

2814
04:09:18,079 --> 04:09:19,440
Like, who are you?

2815
04:09:19,440 --> 04:09:20,319
Who are you?

2816
04:09:20,319 --> 04:09:20,799
Who are you?

2817
04:09:20,799 --> 04:09:21,680
Who are you?

2818
04:09:21,680 --> 04:09:23,420
I'm just like, you're looking at me.

2819
04:09:23,420 --> 04:09:25,420
I know when you turn your head to the side, you're looking at me.

2820
04:09:25,420 --> 04:09:30,700
You would be a toucan.

2821
04:09:30,700 --> 04:09:31,579
Definitely.

2822
04:09:31,579 --> 04:09:32,780
What a cool bird.

2823
04:09:32,780 --> 04:09:34,139
What an amazing bird.

2824
04:09:34,139 --> 04:09:35,780
That sounds awesome.

2825
04:09:35,780 --> 04:09:38,639
What a cool.

2826
04:09:38,639 --> 04:09:40,239
Oh dude, you'd be a toucan.

2827
04:09:40,239 --> 04:09:41,360
That's fucking cool.

2828
04:09:41,360 --> 04:09:42,959
What a cool animal that is.

2829
04:09:42,959 --> 04:09:52,100
Your webcam looks really crusty today.

2830
04:09:52,100 --> 04:09:53,860
I think I look crusty.

2831
04:09:53,860 --> 04:09:56,700
You just don't want to say that.

2832
04:09:56,700 --> 04:09:57,100
All right.

2833
04:09:57,100 --> 04:10:04,270
I'm buying the bastard sword and I'm going to sell.

2834
04:10:08,959 --> 04:10:13,569
I'm going to sell the long sword and then upgrade the bastard sword.

2835
04:10:28,129 --> 04:10:28,610
120.

2836
04:10:28,610 --> 04:10:28,770
All right.

2837
04:10:28,770 --> 04:10:29,649
So it was the right idea.

2838
04:10:33,950 --> 04:10:37,600
Oh, well now I have two.

2839
04:10:49,659 --> 04:10:50,059
It's all right.

2840
04:10:50,620 --> 04:10:51,979
I got 130 damage now.

2841
04:10:51,979 --> 04:10:52,780
Better than what I had before.

2842
04:10:58,290 --> 04:10:59,010
I guess I can.

2843
04:11:01,440 --> 04:11:02,879
Torgl doesn't have an inventory.

2844
04:11:03,739 --> 04:11:05,180
I love this down here.

2845
04:11:05,180 --> 04:11:09,520
This is great.

2846
04:11:09,520 --> 04:11:11,840
It doesn't seem to have an inventory.

2847
04:11:16,110 --> 04:11:17,549
This seems like it can be upgraded though.

2848
04:11:23,700 --> 04:11:26,500
Okay, actually, it's probably better stuff to put on.

2849
04:11:36,110 --> 04:11:36,909
Dark sash.

2850
04:11:37,709 --> 04:11:46,510
Steel crowns.

2851
04:11:48,739 --> 04:11:50,500
This is way better than what I have right now.

2852
04:12:03,200 --> 04:12:03,840
Iron belt.

2853
04:12:04,799 --> 04:12:05,200
Can't do.

2854
04:12:05,200 --> 04:12:06,879
I'll put dark sash on.

2855
04:12:12,500 --> 04:12:13,540
Bastard sword plus two.

2856
04:12:16,829 --> 04:12:18,030
And then steel crowns.

2857
04:12:18,989 --> 04:12:20,430
Now let me sell this other stuff.

2858
04:12:21,149 --> 04:12:24,450
Oh, I actually do.

2859
04:12:24,450 --> 04:12:24,930
It's just different.

2860
04:12:25,489 --> 04:12:30,239
Doesn't it look different from my mind?

2861
04:12:37,680 --> 04:12:40,690
Hey, I crafted it and made money.

2862
04:12:41,250 --> 04:12:42,350
That's how I see it.

2863
04:12:51,059 --> 04:12:54,110
I don't want to sell any of these.

2864
04:13:00,659 --> 04:13:01,620
I'm not buying potions either.

2865
04:13:05,200 --> 04:13:05,600
All right.

2866
04:13:05,600 --> 04:13:06,319
I'm good.

2867
04:13:06,319 --> 04:13:07,600
Let's continue with what we're doing.

2868
04:13:08,159 --> 04:13:15,059
New weapon upgraded.

2869
04:13:15,059 --> 04:13:15,459
Let's go.

2870
04:13:16,020 --> 04:13:21,840
You'd be a screeching owl.

2871
04:13:30,379 --> 04:13:31,389
Count based.

2872
04:13:32,030 --> 04:13:47,149
Oh, that's what we saw when we were...

2873
04:14:05,219 --> 04:14:06,899
I was under the impression that we did that.

2874
04:14:08,979 --> 04:14:14,139
I thought we did that.

2875
04:14:21,010 --> 04:14:21,489
Maybe not.

2876
04:14:27,309 --> 04:14:40,430
Lost our party members.

2877
04:14:42,979 --> 04:14:44,020
Awakening.

2878
04:14:44,020 --> 04:14:57,709
Where did he go?

2879
04:15:09,219 --> 04:15:40,559
Oh, shit.

2880
04:15:42,239 --> 04:15:43,360
Oh, do I have to dodge?

2881
04:16:00,750 --> 04:16:01,549
We cut the shit.

2882
04:16:24,590 --> 04:16:24,829
All right.

2883
04:16:24,829 --> 04:16:26,030
So what's the deal?

2884
04:16:26,030 --> 04:16:26,909
Is it us?

2885
04:16:26,909 --> 04:16:27,790
Is it you?

2886
04:16:27,790 --> 04:16:29,069
Is it her?

2887
04:16:37,780 --> 04:16:38,260
Is this...

2888
04:16:38,260 --> 04:16:39,059
Is this Joshua?

2889
04:16:39,620 --> 04:16:40,899
This is Joshua.

2890
04:16:40,899 --> 04:17:01,489
All right.

2891
04:17:01,489 --> 04:17:01,889
Let's go.

2892
04:17:02,770 --> 04:17:08,659
She's huge.

2893
04:17:27,020 --> 04:17:27,739
Holy shit.

2894
04:17:27,739 --> 04:17:28,059
Okay.

2895
04:17:28,059 --> 04:17:28,620
We got to go.

2896
04:17:46,079 --> 04:17:46,879
Holy shit.

2897
04:17:46,879 --> 04:17:47,360
That hurt.

2898
04:18:06,379 --> 04:18:07,100
Take down.

2899
04:18:07,100 --> 04:18:08,860
Larger enemies will become partially staggered

2900
04:18:08,860 --> 04:18:11,180
when their will gauges are reduced to 50%.

2901
04:18:12,610 --> 04:18:14,049
Using Garuda's deadly embrace

2902
04:18:14,049 --> 04:18:16,209
on a partially staggered enemy will topple it,

2903
04:18:16,209 --> 04:18:18,370
leaving it vulnerable to follow-up attacks.

2904
04:18:19,329 --> 04:18:19,569
Okay.

2905
04:18:20,450 --> 04:18:24,030
So deadly embrace.

2906
04:18:24,829 --> 04:18:26,690
I don't even have that equipped.

2907
04:18:27,569 --> 04:18:29,729
Oh, yes, I do.

2908
04:19:11,180 --> 04:19:12,540
It's in mod chat right now.

2909
04:19:13,340 --> 04:19:15,020
What is in mod chat right now?

2910
04:19:26,479 --> 04:19:27,040
10k.

2911
04:19:27,040 --> 04:19:27,520
Let's go.

2912
04:19:44,739 --> 04:19:45,540
Oh, jeez.

2913
04:19:46,500 --> 04:19:59,229
I think I just have to avoid it.

2914
04:20:07,760 --> 04:20:10,079
Oh, that hurt a lot.

2915
04:20:11,200 --> 04:20:43,600
Oh, pull her down.

2916
04:21:16,719 --> 04:21:17,200
It hurt.

2917
04:21:18,000 --> 04:21:52,780
Goodbye.

2918
04:21:52,780 --> 04:21:53,659
Perfect music.

2919
04:22:24,879 --> 04:22:25,120
Oh.

2920
04:22:27,649 --> 04:22:29,549
Oh, it's over.

2921
04:22:34,110 --> 04:22:34,510
Pause.

2922
04:22:35,809 --> 04:22:36,129
Damn.

2923
04:22:36,850 --> 04:22:40,370
That was cool.

2924
04:22:40,370 --> 04:22:42,430
Music's...

2925
04:22:42,430 --> 04:22:44,350
Honestly, music's probably my favorite part.

2926
04:22:44,350 --> 04:22:48,059
There's so many different ups and downs.

2927
04:22:48,059 --> 04:22:48,700
There's so many different...

2928
04:22:49,420 --> 04:22:50,459
Yeah, it's great.

2929
04:22:50,459 --> 04:22:53,659
55 fangs came out of that.

2930
04:22:53,739 --> 04:23:06,930
Dude, I have to show you what they put in mod chat.

2931
04:23:06,930 --> 04:23:08,370
It is fucking crazy.

2932
04:23:12,379 --> 04:23:15,180
Some of these are fucking insane.

2933
04:23:16,299 --> 04:23:17,979
What even is this supposed to be?

2934
04:23:18,860 --> 04:23:19,340
I'm gonna...

2935
04:23:19,340 --> 04:23:19,739
Hold on.

2936
04:23:19,739 --> 04:23:20,540
Just watch the cutscene.

2937
04:23:20,540 --> 04:23:21,420
I don't want to fuck this up

2938
04:23:21,420 --> 04:23:23,180
because this is like insane.

2939
04:23:24,219 --> 04:23:35,069
Wait.

2940
04:23:35,069 --> 04:23:35,389
Uh-oh.

2941
04:24:00,219 --> 04:24:00,620
Uh-oh.

2942
04:24:00,620 --> 04:24:18,399
It's me, right?

2943
04:24:18,399 --> 04:24:19,040
That's what I...

2944
04:24:19,040 --> 04:24:19,920
That's what I was thinking.

2945
04:24:21,469 --> 04:24:21,709
Yeah.

2946
04:24:22,350 --> 04:24:54,559
It's in emote now.

2947
04:24:55,600 --> 04:24:58,370
Oh, shit.

2948
04:24:59,170 --> 04:25:04,379
I think this is gonna be a big deal.

2949
04:25:05,340 --> 04:25:14,159
All right.

2950
04:25:14,159 --> 04:25:16,000
That's really funny, but I need to pay attention.

2951
04:25:16,719 --> 04:25:22,989
No way.

2952
04:25:22,989 --> 04:25:24,110
Do I get to play like this?

2953
04:25:25,969 --> 04:25:26,610
You do.

2954
04:25:26,610 --> 04:25:26,930
Okay.

2955
04:25:28,270 --> 04:25:28,750
Ifrit.

2956
04:25:29,469 --> 04:25:31,899
Melee ranged and evade.

2957
04:25:32,540 --> 04:25:36,370
Charging enemy covering great.

2958
04:25:36,370 --> 04:25:37,649
This is a short period of time,

2959
04:25:37,649 --> 04:25:40,209
as well as dealing damage if the enemy is struck.

2960
04:25:40,930 --> 04:25:43,469
All abilities available while embodying Ifrit

2961
04:25:43,469 --> 04:25:46,590
can be obtained and confirmed on the abilities tab.

2962
04:25:46,590 --> 04:25:46,989
Let's go.

2963
04:25:55,020 --> 04:25:56,139
Monster battle time.

2964
04:26:04,000 --> 04:26:05,200
Oh, that was good.

2965
04:26:06,079 --> 04:26:12,319
Holy shit.

2966
04:26:13,809 --> 04:26:15,409
85,000 damage.

2967
04:26:24,459 --> 04:26:24,860
Punch.

2968
04:26:25,500 --> 04:26:51,899
Skyfall.

2969
04:26:52,860 --> 04:26:59,569
Tap.

2970
04:27:00,049 --> 04:27:01,100
No.

2971
04:27:01,899 --> 04:27:28,530
Uh-oh.

2972
04:27:29,170 --> 04:27:29,889
I'm now losing.

2973
04:27:30,770 --> 04:27:51,809
Oh, 30k.

2974
04:28:12,860 --> 04:28:13,819
Oh, shit.

2975
04:28:13,899 --> 04:28:14,379
That's better.

2976
04:28:34,780 --> 04:28:35,420
You stink.

2977
04:28:36,059 --> 04:28:53,200
Oh, my God.

2978
04:28:54,479 --> 04:28:55,040
Jesus.

2979
04:28:55,920 --> 04:29:16,270
Is this an arm?

2980
04:29:17,600 --> 04:29:18,159
Oh, shit.

2981
04:29:19,520 --> 04:29:38,860
Holy shit.

2982
04:29:39,500 --> 04:29:46,270
Sid right now is down on the ground floor.

2983
04:29:47,229 --> 04:29:51,620
Just like, I can't do any of that shit.

2984
04:29:53,100 --> 04:29:55,739
Gonna be up to you for the rest of the game.

2985
04:29:56,860 --> 04:30:02,190
I thought lightning was cool.

2986
04:30:02,190 --> 04:30:02,750
Not really.

2987
04:30:11,299 --> 04:30:12,420
And we're both throwing back.

2988
04:30:12,979 --> 04:30:27,229
This is awesome.

2989
04:30:27,229 --> 04:30:27,549
What?

2990
04:30:28,430 --> 04:30:33,329
Oh, am I ripping the arms?

2991
04:31:02,930 --> 04:31:03,729
Hellfire?

2992
04:31:04,860 --> 04:31:05,739
Hellfire!

2993
04:31:07,020 --> 04:31:08,059
Hellfire!

2994
04:31:18,659 --> 04:31:18,899
That?

2995
04:31:20,420 --> 04:31:25,120
That sequence took like four months to animate.

2996
04:31:26,370 --> 04:31:27,729
That was crazy.

2997
04:31:27,729 --> 04:31:34,479
That was really cool.

2998
04:31:36,290 --> 04:31:37,409
Wind shard.

2999
04:31:37,409 --> 04:31:47,170
Is there any more or is that it?

3000
04:31:47,170 --> 04:32:06,100
Control Nick Clive.

3001
04:32:06,100 --> 04:32:08,639
It is you, isn't it, Clive?

3002
04:32:13,780 --> 04:32:15,219
Oh, here we go again.

3003
04:32:16,500 --> 04:32:17,000
Now.

3004
04:32:17,459 --> 04:32:31,649
He's not gonna activate into public.

3005
04:32:31,649 --> 04:32:32,770
No, he's not, right?

3006
04:32:33,329 --> 04:32:34,129
We're doing this again?

3007
04:32:45,950 --> 04:32:48,110
What the fuck is going on in this game?

3008
04:32:49,840 --> 04:32:50,159
What?

3009
04:32:55,549 --> 04:32:56,989
It's like a giant wizard.

3010
04:33:02,850 --> 04:33:33,869
Does he shrink back down to?

3011
04:33:35,549 --> 04:33:44,959
You're too nice as your problem.

3012
04:33:45,599 --> 04:33:47,500
Tells you to quit it, dude.

3013
04:33:47,500 --> 04:33:47,740
Yeah.

3014
04:33:48,380 --> 04:33:52,400
That's this.

3015
04:33:52,400 --> 04:34:08,139
Okay, well, so do I, can I get electricity out of my hands?

3016
04:34:09,020 --> 04:34:10,779
Because that's what I'm into.

3017
04:34:12,290 --> 04:34:13,250
Lorecheck, please.

3018
04:34:13,889 --> 04:34:25,009
The Warden of the Wind who Benedict had transformed into during her ill-fated flight

3019
04:34:25,009 --> 04:34:28,689
from the Empire takes the form of a fearful harpy,

3020
04:34:28,689 --> 04:34:34,830
summoning storms and tearing into the flesh to prey with hawk-like talons.

3021
04:34:34,830 --> 04:34:42,380
Such is the icon's frenzy for destruction that even allies of the dominant of the day won't.

3022
04:34:42,380 --> 04:34:44,990
And let's try that again.

3023
04:34:44,990 --> 04:34:48,590
For destruction that even allies of the dominant of the day are won't

3024
04:34:48,590 --> 04:34:52,110
to begin fleeting the battlefield when dark clouds gather over.

3025
04:34:52,110 --> 04:34:57,090
Wait, am I reading this wrong?

3026
04:34:57,090 --> 04:34:58,529
Am I reading this wrong?

3027
04:34:58,529 --> 04:35:03,580
I feel like, why can I not read this right?

3028
04:35:03,580 --> 04:35:05,340
Well, that happened.

3029
04:35:05,340 --> 04:35:06,779
All right, well, I love how it's like,

3030
04:35:08,139 --> 04:35:10,700
you have like 10 notifications about Sudolphus.

3031
04:35:10,700 --> 04:35:12,139
You have a lot of notifications.

3032
04:35:12,139 --> 04:35:14,619
He's been DMing you about his fucking wizard form.

3033
04:35:42,430 --> 04:35:43,069
That picture.

3034
04:35:43,069 --> 04:35:47,919
The ghost you've been chasing was inside you all along.

3035
04:35:47,919 --> 04:35:50,400
This fucking picture is ridiculous.

3036
04:35:50,400 --> 04:35:51,439
Who even made this?

3037
04:35:55,790 --> 04:35:57,150
I'm going to try to look like that.

3038
04:35:57,150 --> 04:35:58,590
I'm going to just grow everything.

3039
04:35:58,590 --> 04:36:00,669
Just turn the camera on one day, I'm going to look like this.

3040
04:36:01,470 --> 04:36:10,099
And there has to be a part during one of that stream where I laugh like this.

3041
04:36:15,119 --> 04:36:17,439
And my teeth are like black.

3042
04:36:17,919 --> 04:36:38,610
Why did you have to listen to him?

3043
04:36:45,150 --> 04:36:48,029
This can't be what you wanted, can it?

3044
04:37:03,500 --> 04:37:03,819
Dad.

3045
04:37:39,900 --> 04:37:41,549
Some time later.

3046
04:37:41,549 --> 04:37:42,669
How much later is this?

3047
04:37:43,549 --> 04:37:52,029
Who the fuck is this?

3048
04:37:52,590 --> 04:37:53,709
Who is this?

3049
04:37:53,709 --> 04:37:54,830
That horse is giant.

3050
04:37:54,830 --> 04:37:55,389
Oh my God.

3051
04:37:55,389 --> 04:37:58,400
The king is bold, desperate.

3052
04:37:58,400 --> 04:38:04,220
Will you engage him personally, your highness?

3053
04:38:04,779 --> 04:38:07,229
Of course.

3054
04:38:07,229 --> 04:38:08,669
Am I going to engage him personally?

3055
04:38:08,669 --> 04:38:10,430
Of course I'm going to turn into a giant whale.

3056
04:38:11,389 --> 04:38:13,470
You don't think I have the giant dolphin power?

3057
04:38:13,470 --> 04:38:14,909
Griegel's breath fill your wings.

3058
04:38:14,909 --> 04:38:16,270
You know what the fuck you're talking to?

3059
04:38:20,029 --> 04:38:20,669
Yep.

3060
04:38:20,669 --> 04:38:40,029
The Hombet.

3061
04:38:40,029 --> 04:38:41,069
The prince is with us.

3062
04:39:01,939 --> 04:39:03,139
New music track too.

3063
04:39:04,020 --> 04:39:31,490
Am I going to have to fight all these things eventually?

3064
04:39:34,529 --> 04:39:53,180
Precision?

3065
04:39:53,180 --> 04:39:54,909
Yeah.

3066
04:39:54,909 --> 04:39:55,950
Reform the cohorts.

3067
04:39:56,509 --> 04:40:09,700
At once, your highness.

3068
04:40:09,700 --> 04:40:10,979
I can't get over.

3069
04:40:10,979 --> 04:40:14,020
I can't get over the germa that drank the chaos potion.

3070
04:40:14,659 --> 04:40:17,459
You know, I've got powers but I'm all fucked up now.

3071
04:40:45,330 --> 04:41:00,779
That was cool.

3072
04:41:02,750 --> 04:41:03,709
No, I don't want to lore check.

3073
04:41:03,709 --> 04:41:05,630
I don't want to spoil myself or anything.

3074
04:41:26,270 --> 04:41:32,139
You plan on streaming the whole game?

3075
04:41:34,080 --> 04:41:36,189
Let's figure that out.

3076
04:41:36,189 --> 04:41:37,630
I'm going to ask you that very question.

3077
04:41:37,950 --> 04:41:39,389
Ah, you're awake.

3078
04:41:39,950 --> 04:41:42,819
Because I really like it.

3079
04:41:42,819 --> 04:41:43,700
I would.

3080
04:41:43,700 --> 04:41:45,220
You're just full of surprises.

3081
04:41:45,220 --> 04:41:46,020
I think it's fun.

3082
04:41:46,020 --> 04:41:49,939
First that trick with Geruda, then whatever the hell that other thing was.

3083
04:41:52,529 --> 04:41:54,209
Didn't know you had it in you.

3084
04:41:56,959 --> 04:41:58,909
Do it.

3085
04:41:58,909 --> 04:41:59,409
Hey.

3086
04:42:05,470 --> 04:42:06,189
It was me.

3087
04:42:07,229 --> 04:42:08,029
I killed him.

3088
04:42:08,990 --> 04:42:10,830
I killed Joshua.

3089
04:42:10,830 --> 04:42:11,950
I killed them all.

3090
04:42:12,669 --> 04:42:13,790
I'm a monster.

3091
04:42:14,830 --> 04:42:16,509
And I deserve to die.

3092
04:42:18,349 --> 04:42:19,229
So end it.

3093
04:42:20,270 --> 04:42:20,770
End it.

3094
04:42:21,950 --> 04:42:22,450
Please.

3095
04:42:23,069 --> 04:42:23,569
Please.

3096
04:42:31,650 --> 04:42:32,930
I reckon I can take you.

3097
04:42:33,810 --> 04:42:34,849
If that's what you want.

3098
04:42:37,619 --> 04:42:43,060
But first, I thought I'd give you the benefit of my timeless wisdom.

3099
04:42:47,009 --> 04:42:47,970
It seems to me-

3100
04:42:47,970 --> 04:42:48,849
Take him in a fight.

3101
04:42:49,409 --> 04:42:53,650
But since you're still breathing, you might as well make yourself useful.

3102
04:42:53,650 --> 04:42:54,610
I don't know about that.

3103
04:42:56,659 --> 04:42:57,299
Get dressed.

3104
04:42:58,180 --> 04:43:00,580
Pretty as you are, you're not my type.

3105
04:43:05,979 --> 04:43:08,540
I'll see you in the hole.

3106
04:43:08,540 --> 04:43:13,490
I don't know, I have uncontrollable demon rage.

3107
04:43:16,880 --> 04:43:22,610
He's a cool wizard, but I mean, gigantic demon.

3108
04:43:22,610 --> 04:43:26,580
I think I can win.

3109
04:43:26,580 --> 04:43:44,930
He just beat you.

3110
04:43:44,930 --> 04:43:46,369
Yeah, but I wasn't prepared.

3111
04:43:46,369 --> 04:43:48,209
What are you going to do now?

3112
04:43:48,209 --> 04:43:55,279
Plus, I was fighting Garuda, who was also one of these icons.

3113
04:43:55,279 --> 04:43:59,009
Wages of guilt.

3114
04:43:59,009 --> 04:44:06,830
There are certain times during the game that side quests will become temporarily unavailable

3115
04:44:06,830 --> 04:44:09,389
until progress has been made through the main scenario.

3116
04:44:09,389 --> 04:44:13,840
Okay, so I have to focus on the main story.

3117
04:44:13,840 --> 04:44:16,240
There's, we'll hear what he has to say.

3118
04:44:22,029 --> 04:44:24,750
Don't go making me throw you back in there now, eh?

3119
04:44:25,979 --> 04:44:26,479
Hello, Doug.

3120
04:44:27,180 --> 04:44:35,889
I think I'm just gonna upgrade if I can.

3121
04:44:36,610 --> 04:44:37,330
So, what'd it be?

3122
04:44:38,130 --> 04:44:38,689
What is that?

3123
04:44:39,409 --> 04:44:41,409
That's the, okay, this is, this one's purple.

3124
04:44:46,450 --> 04:44:47,169
Storm Cry.

3125
04:44:51,520 --> 04:44:53,279
That's way cooler than the Bastard Sword.

3126
04:44:53,840 --> 04:45:06,220
Does it have any properties on it or is it just, they don't get it?

3127
04:45:08,380 --> 04:45:09,659
No scratches, right?

3128
04:45:13,810 --> 04:45:15,330
Can't reinforce it.

3129
04:45:15,330 --> 04:45:18,000
Anything else?

3130
04:45:18,639 --> 04:45:22,619
Ooh, cool looking.

3131
04:45:22,619 --> 04:45:28,700
Can I buy anything from you out here?

3132
04:45:29,419 --> 04:45:31,020
Look what the curl dragged in.

3133
04:45:31,979 --> 04:45:33,500
Coin purse weighing you down?

3134
04:45:42,319 --> 04:45:43,119
This is just better.

3135
04:45:43,919 --> 04:45:44,479
Call my guy.

3136
04:45:44,479 --> 04:45:46,720
Hold on, can I make anything new besides the sword?

3137
04:45:46,720 --> 04:45:48,720
I'm not much bothered either way.

3138
04:45:48,720 --> 04:45:51,659
Play it quick.

3139
04:45:52,220 --> 04:45:55,819
What do you want?

3140
04:45:55,819 --> 04:46:16,049
What am I wearing for a belt right now?

3141
04:46:16,049 --> 04:46:18,270
This one, right?

3142
04:46:20,240 --> 04:46:20,799
Plus two.

3143
04:46:21,599 --> 04:46:24,880
I need a plus one, but don't I already, oh, I have a plus two.

3144
04:46:24,880 --> 04:46:27,599
I just don't, I can't upgrade any more plus, uh, pass plus two.

3145
04:46:29,250 --> 04:46:30,930
Okay, well, I have the new weapon.

3146
04:46:30,930 --> 04:46:31,490
That's all that matters.

3147
04:46:31,490 --> 04:46:32,049
Anything else?

3148
04:46:32,849 --> 04:46:38,419
Hi, can we, can we get a poll in chat?

3149
04:46:39,729 --> 04:46:44,380
Do you want me to continue to stream Final Fantasy 16?

3150
04:46:45,419 --> 04:46:47,259
It would probably be on the, just chill nights.

3151
04:46:47,979 --> 04:46:51,040
Probably turn the cam off, play it and just hang out.

3152
04:46:51,599 --> 04:46:52,080
What do you think?

3153
04:46:52,080 --> 04:46:52,639
Can we get a poll?

3154
04:46:53,360 --> 04:46:56,779
I really like it.

3155
04:46:56,779 --> 04:46:58,700
So I'm going to play it regardless.

3156
04:46:58,700 --> 04:47:01,740
So I'm either going to, I'm either going to turn it on and just play it

3157
04:47:01,740 --> 04:47:05,340
for fun, just chilling out on stream or I'm just going to play this

3158
04:47:05,340 --> 04:47:07,020
and just with my mouth open on the couch.

3159
04:47:07,659 --> 04:47:15,619
That has to be 85% at least since you gave that same number

3160
04:47:15,619 --> 04:47:17,380
to Strawberry Magic.

3161
04:47:17,380 --> 04:47:20,419
Strawberry Magic is not Final Fantasy 16.

3162
04:47:20,419 --> 04:47:25,709
Final Fantasy 16 is a little different than Strawberry Magic was.

3163
04:47:26,819 --> 04:47:27,779
I would say.

3164
04:47:27,779 --> 04:47:28,819
I think that's a little different.

3165
04:47:29,459 --> 04:47:36,900
I mean, most people are into it.

3166
04:47:36,900 --> 04:47:38,740
Then I'll keep playing it.

3167
04:47:38,740 --> 04:47:41,069
I mean, that's pretty overwhelming.

3168
04:47:41,069 --> 04:47:42,990
That seems like it was almost 90%.

3169
04:47:44,029 --> 04:47:46,509
Yeah, I'll, I'll just stream it more.

3170
04:47:52,270 --> 04:47:55,310
Uh, I'm going to do this next mission and then I'm probably going to call it.

3171
04:47:55,310 --> 04:47:58,270
So whatever happens at the end of this, that'll be it for tonight.

3172
04:47:58,270 --> 04:47:59,229
I'll see you on Saturday.

3173
04:47:59,869 --> 04:48:02,830
Uh, the sponsor is obviously Square Enix, sponsor of the stream,

3174
04:48:02,830 --> 04:48:04,110
but I kind of kept going.

3175
04:48:08,209 --> 04:48:08,770
Very, very fun.

3176
04:48:17,810 --> 04:48:18,689
What are you going to do with the demos?

3177
04:48:21,650 --> 04:48:22,610
Uh, Saturday.

3178
04:48:28,529 --> 04:48:28,770
Gav.

3179
04:48:32,450 --> 04:48:34,209
Gav's gone through a fair bit of trouble for you.

3180
04:48:34,849 --> 04:48:37,169
The least you can do is hear the poor bugger out.

3181
04:48:37,889 --> 04:48:39,540
He's going to meet us at the King's.

3182
04:48:39,540 --> 04:48:42,819
Yes, we'll play SOS 3 on Saturday and we'll do some steam demos.

3183
04:48:44,959 --> 04:48:48,159
And then after that, after Saturday, I'll probably come back to this and just play.

3184
04:48:48,720 --> 04:48:51,599
Oh yeah, I Square Enix, thanks for the sponsor.

3185
04:48:51,599 --> 04:48:53,279
Um, the game's great.

3186
04:48:53,840 --> 04:48:56,400
It's out on PS5 right now.

3187
04:48:56,400 --> 04:48:57,520
Came out literally today.

3188
04:48:58,639 --> 04:48:59,919
It's very good.

3189
04:49:00,560 --> 04:49:01,759
The demo is available.

3190
04:49:01,759 --> 04:49:03,919
You can just get the demo and play it if you want right now.

3191
04:49:03,919 --> 04:49:06,720
You've seen it already, but if you want to check it out, maybe see if it's for you.

3192
04:49:07,680 --> 04:49:08,750
I think it's great.

3193
04:49:08,750 --> 04:49:09,470
I'm having a lot of fun.

3194
04:49:09,470 --> 04:49:10,270
I'm going to continue to play it.

3195
04:49:10,270 --> 04:49:11,229
I'm going to keep streaming it.

3196
04:49:11,229 --> 04:49:16,159
So, but for now, let's, um, let's finish up this last mission

3197
04:49:16,159 --> 04:49:17,680
and then I will call it and see you Saturday.

3198
04:49:18,319 --> 04:49:25,409
Uh, I don't think I need any other items.

3199
04:49:32,419 --> 04:49:37,860
We waited 295 days for a half a stream of sorcery.

3200
04:49:37,860 --> 04:49:42,770
Dude, you're a booger streamer.

3201
04:49:48,220 --> 04:49:50,380
Yeah, I'm not just getting half a stream of sorcery.

3202
04:49:50,380 --> 04:49:53,659
You're getting us getting back into sorcery.

3203
04:49:54,459 --> 04:49:58,299
Plus you're getting, I'm going to do voices.

3204
04:49:58,299 --> 04:50:04,959
German does voices, right?

3205
04:50:04,959 --> 04:50:06,400
It's so funny when German does voices.

3206
04:50:08,900 --> 04:50:12,900
You'll get at least two or three different tones and two or three different pitches.

3207
04:50:13,779 --> 04:50:15,459
Someone's going to sound like this.

3208
04:50:15,459 --> 04:50:16,659
Isn't that cool?

3209
04:50:16,659 --> 04:50:17,540
Isn't that weird?

3210
04:50:26,860 --> 04:50:28,139
And I'll do the dinosaur quiz.

3211
04:50:28,139 --> 04:50:29,259
What dinosaur are you?

3212
04:50:44,159 --> 04:50:45,840
Please think about it.

3213
04:50:45,840 --> 04:50:55,680
Clive, the rumors all point to that was an Imperial signal.

3214
04:50:56,799 --> 04:50:57,680
There shouldn't be here.

3215
04:50:58,240 --> 04:50:59,919
The old force been abandoned for years.

3216
04:51:01,540 --> 04:51:02,740
Our little chat can wait.

3217
04:51:03,380 --> 04:51:05,139
I need to see what the bastards are up to.

3218
04:51:05,139 --> 04:51:08,020
For those of you that didn't know, I know we talked about it a few times,

3219
04:51:08,020 --> 04:51:11,619
but you liked Final Fantasy 14.

3220
04:51:13,330 --> 04:51:18,900
The producer and director of Final Fantasy 14, producer of this game.

3221
04:51:22,110 --> 04:51:24,590
I know that a lot of people really like that game.

3222
04:51:24,590 --> 04:51:41,740
So you obviously got the devil may cry, Yoshi P, Yoshi P, Yoshi P is a legend.

3223
04:51:46,639 --> 04:51:50,720
Honestly, I wait till he's done talking.

3224
04:51:54,380 --> 04:51:56,220
I was never really into Final Fantasy.

3225
04:51:57,419 --> 04:51:59,659
I was a big, I liked the old ones,

3226
04:52:00,380 --> 04:52:02,779
but I didn't really pay that much attention past like six or seven.

3227
04:52:02,779 --> 04:52:03,099
Really?

3228
04:52:05,759 --> 04:52:06,479
This is good.

3229
04:52:06,479 --> 04:52:07,279
This is really good.

3230
04:52:08,590 --> 04:52:09,950
I'm very happy with it so far.

3231
04:52:14,450 --> 04:52:18,830
Oh, there's a giant enemy.

3232
04:52:19,790 --> 04:52:46,340
Spiders have a follow up to that, don't I?

3233
04:53:29,810 --> 04:53:30,049
Cool.

3234
04:53:37,150 --> 04:53:40,110
Yeah, the composer and sound director of Final Fantasy 14.

3235
04:53:40,830 --> 04:53:41,709
That's soaking.

3236
04:53:42,430 --> 04:53:42,909
Don't know.

3237
04:53:43,709 --> 04:53:44,509
Also on this game.

3238
04:53:45,470 --> 04:53:47,869
Somebody said this is like a dream team for Final Fantasy,

3239
04:53:48,990 --> 04:53:51,409
which that's really cool.

3240
04:53:52,049 --> 04:54:10,700
Is that a Minotaur?

3241
04:54:15,419 --> 04:54:16,380
It is a Minotaur.

3242
04:54:21,200 --> 04:54:21,759
All right, let's go.

3243
04:54:22,319 --> 04:54:43,729
Pull him down.

3244
04:54:52,479 --> 04:54:57,069
Oh, I'm having heels.

3245
04:54:57,869 --> 04:55:47,819
Oh, that was perfect.

3246
04:55:54,000 --> 04:55:55,279
Oh, cool down.

3247
04:55:59,810 --> 04:56:11,060
Oh, I did not time that right.

3248
04:56:11,700 --> 04:56:12,900
All right, don't blow it here.

3249
04:56:12,900 --> 04:56:13,299
Don't blow it.

3250
04:56:13,299 --> 04:56:13,700
Don't blow it.

3251
04:56:14,740 --> 04:56:15,580
This time.

3252
04:56:17,790 --> 04:56:42,939
This time.

3253
04:56:42,939 --> 04:56:46,939
If you do Torgl buttons mid-dodge, you'll get precision.

3254
04:56:47,659 --> 04:56:51,549
Cool.

3255
04:56:51,549 --> 04:56:58,580
Pet Torgl, oh, we're going to riot.

3256
04:56:58,580 --> 04:56:59,299
I did already have.

3257
04:56:59,939 --> 04:57:06,029
I love how he's just kind of like, yeah.

3258
04:57:13,500 --> 04:57:14,299
I need to heal.

3259
04:57:15,259 --> 04:57:18,689
Potion.

3260
04:57:18,689 --> 04:57:24,180
I need way more of those.

3261
04:57:29,819 --> 04:57:31,979
He's never going to check the lore ever again.

3262
04:57:32,860 --> 04:57:39,970
Hey, dude.

3263
04:57:39,970 --> 04:57:42,619
The hooded man.

3264
04:57:42,619 --> 04:57:46,610
A mysterious man that many believed to be a dominant of fire.

3265
04:57:47,169 --> 04:57:51,970
Clive first saw him at Phoenix Gate on the night of the Imperial invasion.

3266
04:57:51,970 --> 04:57:56,529
And for years believed him to be the dominant of the icon that killed his brother.

3267
04:57:56,529 --> 04:58:03,180
But to Clive's eternal chagrin, he has proved otherwise.

3268
04:58:15,490 --> 04:58:16,610
Pretty bloody hides.

3269
04:58:27,599 --> 04:58:48,110
What does it mean?

3270
04:58:48,669 --> 04:59:06,419
Oh, that's a good move.

3271
04:59:32,509 --> 04:59:33,150
Awesome music.

3272
04:59:33,790 --> 04:59:38,619
I just keep biting my lip and it's going to cause me stress.

3273
04:59:39,500 --> 04:59:46,529
Still making a little clay guys.

3274
04:59:47,490 --> 04:59:52,479
I actually haven't in a little while, but I'll get back into it.

3275
04:59:59,900 --> 05:00:00,779
Another minotaur.

3276
05:00:01,340 --> 05:00:02,849
Okay.

3277
05:00:02,849 --> 05:00:04,130
Well, I beat one.

3278
05:00:04,130 --> 05:00:04,849
I could beat the other.

3279
05:00:05,810 --> 05:00:06,610
Oh, this is not good.

3280
05:00:12,799 --> 05:00:15,090
I saw him come from a mile away, too.

3281
05:01:53,630 --> 05:02:02,479
Stop hurting these poor animals.

3282
05:02:03,200 --> 05:02:04,319
They don't deserve this.

3283
05:02:05,119 --> 05:02:16,349
You're saying true.

3284
05:02:17,790 --> 05:02:20,020
Is a minotaur an animal?

3285
05:02:20,740 --> 05:02:22,500
What is a minotaur?

3286
05:02:22,500 --> 05:02:25,380
Isn't a minotaur like a guy with horns that's like a bull?

3287
05:02:26,750 --> 05:02:29,069
Minotaur is like a mythical being.

3288
05:02:37,919 --> 05:02:39,119
Half man, half bull.

3289
05:02:40,400 --> 05:02:41,599
Humans are animals.

3290
05:02:43,650 --> 05:02:49,459
Yeah, animals can be mythical, too.

3291
05:02:51,090 --> 05:02:51,889
You're an animal.

3292
05:02:51,889 --> 05:02:52,930
I'm an animal.

3293
05:02:52,930 --> 05:02:54,130
Stop the violence.

3294
05:03:07,380 --> 05:03:09,380
There's no way I'm going to let Gab die.

3295
05:03:09,459 --> 05:03:11,139
I'll be actually upset if Gab dies.

3296
05:03:12,459 --> 05:03:14,380
They keep killing characters.

3297
05:03:14,380 --> 05:03:15,900
I will be upset if Gab is dead.

3298
05:03:36,639 --> 05:03:40,080
Bye.

3299
05:03:40,959 --> 05:04:09,389
Your webcam is atomically...

3300
05:04:27,860 --> 05:04:28,819
Are we doing it?

3301
05:04:28,819 --> 05:04:29,459
Are we doing it?

3302
05:04:30,419 --> 05:04:34,299
No, it's all right.

3303
05:04:34,299 --> 05:04:34,939
What's his name?

3304
05:04:35,979 --> 05:04:37,900
Uncle Fester is here to help us.

3305
05:04:37,900 --> 05:04:38,540
What's his name?

3306
05:04:40,139 --> 05:04:40,779
Forget his name.

3307
05:04:43,099 --> 05:04:43,659
Sid!

3308
05:04:43,659 --> 05:04:44,220
That's it.

3309
05:04:45,979 --> 05:04:46,299
Okay.

3310
05:04:57,599 --> 05:04:58,400
Oh, let's go.

3311
05:05:41,779 --> 05:05:42,819
Do you have any heals, dude?

3312
05:05:42,819 --> 05:05:43,619
Do you have any potions?

3313
05:06:14,610 --> 05:06:15,090
Oh, yeah.

3314
05:06:15,810 --> 05:06:16,130
Shit.

3315
05:06:25,869 --> 05:06:26,349
Uh-oh.

3316
05:06:27,389 --> 05:06:27,709
I got it.

3317
05:06:27,709 --> 05:06:28,830
That's exactly what I was trying to do.

3318
05:06:54,180 --> 05:06:56,430
Oh, shit.

3319
05:07:29,380 --> 05:07:30,340
Jesus Christ.

3320
05:07:33,470 --> 05:07:39,150
I had potions.

3321
05:07:39,150 --> 05:07:40,830
I had potions and I didn't use them.

3322
05:07:45,549 --> 05:07:45,950
Get in.

3323
05:08:08,979 --> 05:08:10,500
That was really, really scary.

3324
05:08:19,009 --> 05:08:19,650
First death.

3325
05:08:22,340 --> 05:08:23,540
Level 19.

3326
05:08:34,659 --> 05:08:35,299
It doesn't matter.

3327
05:08:35,299 --> 05:08:37,459
I had to sneeze and I couldn't even do the fucking funny joke.

3328
05:08:49,409 --> 05:08:49,970
Come on.

3329
05:08:49,970 --> 05:08:50,689
My back is itchy.

3330
05:08:53,500 --> 05:08:58,299
Each fight in this game feels like it has a lot of weight on it.

3331
05:08:58,299 --> 05:09:02,380
It's like everything feels like you're in this and it feels fun.

3332
05:09:03,340 --> 05:09:04,299
Even fighting the spiders.

3333
05:09:04,939 --> 05:09:08,990
We need to save.

3334
05:09:08,990 --> 05:09:09,549
We got to save.

3335
05:09:09,549 --> 05:09:09,790
Yeah.

3336
05:09:09,790 --> 05:09:11,069
No, this is too much.

3337
05:09:11,069 --> 05:09:12,139
It's too much.

3338
05:09:12,939 --> 05:09:17,779
Shit.

3339
05:09:22,110 --> 05:09:22,669
He's not going to...

3340
05:09:22,669 --> 05:09:25,549
His eyes aren't going to turn like red and he's going to turn like a big goose.

3341
05:09:41,860 --> 05:09:42,419
Holy shit.

3342
05:09:42,419 --> 05:09:43,139
That was cool.

3343
05:09:44,500 --> 05:09:49,860
He's holding on to the rock, right?

3344
05:09:51,419 --> 05:09:51,740
Yes.

3345
05:09:53,819 --> 05:09:57,819
He's got the branch, the one branch sticking out from the rock.

3346
05:09:58,619 --> 05:10:09,819
Do not.

3347
05:10:10,459 --> 05:10:19,819
Thank God.

3348
05:10:21,419 --> 05:10:23,279
Thank God.

3349
05:10:30,750 --> 05:10:47,869
Gav has plot armor.

3350
05:10:47,869 --> 05:10:49,709
Well, I don't speak so soon because

3351
05:10:52,139 --> 05:10:54,459
remember the guy that got hit in the face with the axe

3352
05:10:54,459 --> 05:10:56,139
that we didn't even get an introduction for yet?

3353
05:10:58,139 --> 05:11:01,259
He seemed like he was ready to get involved.

3354
05:11:07,069 --> 05:11:08,430
My sniffing days will be over.

3355
05:11:09,549 --> 05:11:10,029
Thank you.

3356
05:11:11,229 --> 05:11:11,709
Truly.

3357
05:11:12,509 --> 05:11:15,659
Yeah, a lot of people have died.

3358
05:11:15,659 --> 05:11:17,500
That would be deemed pretty important, I would say, huh?

3359
05:11:17,500 --> 05:11:18,619
So, what news?

3360
05:11:19,340 --> 05:11:24,479
I found out where your friend's heading for one thing.

3361
05:11:25,200 --> 05:11:26,959
Gav, I...

3362
05:11:26,959 --> 05:11:31,279
Him and his mate are on their way to your old stomping ground, Rosaria.

3363
05:11:32,159 --> 05:11:36,029
You should have seen what they did to the Imperials who tried to stop them.

3364
05:11:38,500 --> 05:11:39,779
There's no question about it.

3365
05:11:40,659 --> 05:11:43,060
He's a dominant fire, all right?

3366
05:11:43,060 --> 05:11:43,860
He can't be.

3367
05:11:44,259 --> 05:11:48,479
Clive, I saw you turn into an icon before my very eyes.

3368
05:11:49,360 --> 05:11:52,819
And yes, there's a good chance it was you who killed the phoenix.

3369
05:11:53,700 --> 05:11:58,080
But we weren't alone, were we?

3370
05:11:58,080 --> 05:12:00,849
There was the fellow you saw enter the whirlwind.

3371
05:12:01,650 --> 05:12:02,150
I...

3372
05:12:02,990 --> 05:12:03,790
I saw him too.

3373
05:12:04,509 --> 05:12:07,580
You didn't dream it, Clive.

3374
05:12:07,580 --> 05:12:08,299
He's out there.

3375
05:12:08,860 --> 05:12:11,340
I don't know who this guy is, but he's chuffing back at that.

3376
05:12:11,340 --> 05:12:11,840
Who is he?

3377
05:12:12,939 --> 05:12:14,340
Ask me.

3378
05:12:14,340 --> 05:12:15,540
I don't bloody know.

3379
05:12:15,540 --> 05:12:19,659
But I do know one thing.

3380
05:12:20,459 --> 05:12:22,459
You're gonna find him and find out.

3381
05:12:23,259 --> 05:12:25,419
It's a cigarette Andy in chat right now.

3382
05:12:27,650 --> 05:12:29,009
We have a few of those here.

3383
05:12:29,009 --> 05:12:31,090
You swore you'd avenge your brother's death.

3384
05:12:31,650 --> 05:12:34,770
That you'd never rest until you'd hunted down the man responsible.

3385
05:12:36,029 --> 05:12:41,650
So, find out if this man's responsible and kill yourself if he's not.

3386
05:12:44,299 --> 05:12:44,799
Sid.

3387
05:12:45,259 --> 05:12:45,759
I...

3388
05:12:46,220 --> 05:12:47,580
Don't thank me.

3389
05:12:47,580 --> 05:12:48,139
Thank Gav.

3390
05:12:55,520 --> 05:12:56,240
Thank you, Gav.

3391
05:12:57,380 --> 05:12:58,099
Yeah, well, yeah.

3392
05:13:12,220 --> 05:13:12,860
Hot stew?

3393
05:13:14,580 --> 05:13:15,299
Crusty bread?

3394
05:13:16,740 --> 05:13:18,500
No birds returning this year.

3395
05:13:19,220 --> 05:13:24,290
The deadlands have swallowed their roosts like it's not.

3396
05:13:29,220 --> 05:13:30,419
We're running out of time.

3397
05:13:31,139 --> 05:13:33,090
That's definitely Joshua.

3398
05:13:33,090 --> 05:13:34,849
We'll be in Rosaria in a day or two.

3399
05:13:34,849 --> 05:13:35,810
It's a phoenix.

3400
05:13:35,810 --> 05:13:36,770
Phoenixes don't die.

3401
05:13:37,889 --> 05:13:44,720
That goes against all phoenix lore ever.

3402
05:13:44,720 --> 05:13:47,729
Back to where it all began.

3403
05:13:48,770 --> 05:13:49,270
Yeah.

3404
05:13:49,569 --> 05:14:03,099
Who's that?

3405
05:14:03,099 --> 05:14:04,349
Who's the girl?

3406
05:14:04,349 --> 05:14:05,950
He must be stopped.

3407
05:14:05,950 --> 05:14:20,369
We don't have the reveal yet.

3408
05:14:21,330 --> 05:14:23,490
Can't lorry check the non-reveal.

3409
05:14:26,590 --> 05:14:27,790
No updated wiki?

3410
05:14:27,790 --> 05:14:28,430
No, not yet.

3411
05:14:33,680 --> 05:14:34,319
All right, cool.

3412
05:14:35,040 --> 05:14:36,930
I think that about calls it for me.

3413
05:14:38,369 --> 05:14:39,009
That was a good time.

3414
05:14:40,669 --> 05:14:41,630
I will play it again.

3415
05:14:41,630 --> 05:14:42,349
We'll stream it again.

3416
05:14:45,470 --> 05:14:48,830
Saturday, we're going to do Steam Next, Best, and Sorcery.

3417
05:14:48,830 --> 05:14:53,580
And then after Saturday, I'll come back to Final Fantasy 16.

3418
05:15:00,990 --> 05:15:02,029
What are your overall thoughts?

3419
05:15:03,569 --> 05:15:05,630
I think it's...

3420
05:15:06,509 --> 05:15:11,150
So the boss fights are some of the most fun I've had playing a game in a long time.

3421
05:15:11,790 --> 05:15:14,110
You just feel like you're doing a good job.

3422
05:15:14,110 --> 05:15:16,990
The game does a really great job of making you think you're doing very well.

3423
05:15:17,549 --> 05:15:19,069
The dodge mechanic is really fun.

3424
05:15:19,069 --> 05:15:24,270
When the follow-up attack, the music that plays in all the fights,

3425
05:15:24,270 --> 05:15:26,990
they vary it up so it's not the same thing every time, which I really like.

3426
05:15:27,549 --> 05:15:32,529
I don't know how big the world is.

3427
05:15:32,529 --> 05:15:35,409
I think that's the one kind of, I guess, outlier is.

3428
05:15:36,959 --> 05:15:41,040
Is there an opportunity for me to go and just kind of play and go collect stuff?

3429
05:15:41,599 --> 05:15:42,479
I'm imagining so.

3430
05:15:43,569 --> 05:15:45,409
But as it stands so far, I think it's great.

3431
05:15:45,409 --> 05:15:46,130
I'm going to keep playing it.

3432
05:15:57,630 --> 05:15:59,069
It looks like there's quite a bit.

3433
05:15:59,630 --> 05:16:06,560
How long have I played so far, including the demo?

3434
05:16:06,720 --> 05:16:07,840
The demo is included in this, too.

3435
05:16:07,840 --> 05:16:10,959
So this is five hours and about five hours and some change.

3436
05:16:12,459 --> 05:16:14,880
Eight? Eight hours total so far.

3437
05:16:16,060 --> 05:16:16,860
Probably another island.

3438
05:16:17,919 --> 05:16:18,720
Yeah, we'll see.

3439
05:16:19,970 --> 05:16:20,450
I like it.

3440
05:16:20,450 --> 05:16:25,659
I'm having a good time playing it, so I'm going to keep playing it.

3441
05:16:25,659 --> 05:16:29,419
And yes, the stream was sponsored, but I think you all know.

3442
05:16:30,689 --> 05:16:33,490
I don't think I would come back to the game and play it again if I wasn't into it.

3443
05:16:33,490 --> 05:16:35,819
So we'll play it again.

3444
05:16:35,819 --> 05:16:39,740
You'll see it on this channel at some point early next week, mid next week.

3445
05:16:39,740 --> 05:16:46,099
It's a good game, yeah.

3446
05:16:50,110 --> 05:16:51,470
And I'll see you Saturday.

3447
05:16:52,270 --> 05:16:55,630
Thank you again Square Enix for sponsoring the stream.

3448
05:16:56,270 --> 05:16:59,580
Again, it's on PS5 right now.

3449
05:16:59,580 --> 05:17:00,540
You have a PS5.

3450
05:17:00,540 --> 05:17:04,750
I highly recommend you at least check out the demo because that is free.

3451
05:17:04,750 --> 05:17:07,229
And you can just play a little bit of the first few hours of the game.

3452
05:17:07,229 --> 05:17:08,110
First like hour or two.

3453
05:17:08,909 --> 05:17:14,189
Well, I want to make sure I save it, though.

3454
05:17:15,330 --> 05:17:16,369
I think it's auto saves.

3455
05:17:18,509 --> 05:17:19,470
Yeah, I think it's auto saves.

3456
05:17:19,470 --> 05:17:20,189
I'll be fine.

3457
05:17:20,189 --> 05:17:34,369
This is coming through my.

3458
05:17:34,369 --> 05:17:34,849
That's weird.

3459
05:17:34,849 --> 05:17:35,889
It's coming through my speakers.

3460
05:17:39,419 --> 05:17:40,700
They're supposed to be music playing, but.

3461
05:17:41,340 --> 05:17:44,139
It's just coming through my actual speakers.

3462
05:17:44,139 --> 05:17:51,169
Can you hear it?

3463
05:17:51,169 --> 05:17:52,369
Very, very faintly.

3464
05:17:57,470 --> 05:18:01,150
Well, it's playing to my right somehow.

3465
05:18:01,150 --> 05:18:07,360
It's only when you talk.

3466
05:18:07,360 --> 05:18:11,970
Well, thanks for sticking around.

3467
05:18:11,970 --> 05:18:12,770
Have a great night.

3468
05:18:12,770 --> 05:18:14,479
Call your mother.

3469
05:18:14,479 --> 05:18:16,080
Final Fantasy 16.

3470
05:18:16,080 --> 05:18:24,659
Go check it out.

3471
05:18:24,659 --> 05:18:26,020
Thank you for resuming sorcery.

3472
05:18:26,020 --> 05:18:30,720
My mother is back from her trip just in time.

3473
05:18:30,720 --> 05:18:31,759
Well, there you go.

3474
05:18:31,759 --> 05:18:35,069
Put it close to the mic.

3475
05:18:35,069 --> 05:18:36,029
I kind of can't.

3476
05:18:36,029 --> 05:18:38,189
My mic is connected to my desk.

3477
05:18:38,900 --> 05:18:50,049
Kind of bolted on.

3478
05:18:50,049 --> 05:18:51,889
Yeah, it's not going anywhere.

3479
05:18:51,889 --> 05:18:55,810
When's the next no cam chill stream?

3480
05:18:56,939 --> 05:18:58,139
I've been doing a lot of those.

3481
05:18:58,139 --> 05:19:01,860
I mean, just kind of base cam and high energy.

3482
05:19:01,860 --> 05:19:07,200
Just sort of whenever I have the energy, I'll do it.

3483
05:19:07,200 --> 05:19:09,659
But yeah, I mean, maybe next stream.

3484
05:19:09,659 --> 05:19:10,860
The next Final Fantasy stream.

3485
05:19:10,860 --> 05:19:11,259
Absolutely.

3486
05:19:11,259 --> 05:19:15,709
We'll just kind of hang out and just have my mouth open.

3487
05:19:15,709 --> 05:19:16,610
Just playing it.

3488
05:19:16,610 --> 05:19:25,939
What demos do you plan on checking out for next best?

3489
05:19:26,959 --> 05:19:28,479
I plan on just going to the popular tab.

3490
05:19:29,360 --> 05:19:32,319
Obviously, also, if you have a recommendation, put it in the Discord.

3491
05:19:32,319 --> 05:19:34,400
The Discord recommendation channel.

3492
05:19:37,279 --> 05:19:40,860
Give it a look.

3493
05:19:40,860 --> 05:19:44,080
If you have one that you think, well, yeah, you really should play that.

3494
05:19:44,080 --> 05:19:47,119
Then throw it in the recommended.

3495
05:19:47,119 --> 05:19:47,840
I'll take a look.

3496
05:19:47,840 --> 05:19:48,479
Add it on the list.

3497
05:19:48,479 --> 05:19:58,529
I plan on just kind of blowing through a dozen of them or so over a few hours.

3498
05:19:58,529 --> 05:19:59,810
But see you later.

3499
05:19:59,810 --> 05:20:01,540
Don't forget the BLT.

3500
05:20:01,540 --> 05:20:02,340
No, I won't.

3501
05:20:02,340 --> 05:20:08,459
I'll take at least one bite of a BLT on Saturday.

3502
05:20:08,459 --> 05:20:17,759
Probably starting around 4 Pacific on Saturday, 4 p.m.

3503
05:20:17,759 --> 05:20:18,000
All right.

3504
05:20:18,000 --> 05:20:18,880
I'll see you later.

3505
05:20:18,880 --> 05:20:20,369
Have a good night.

3506
05:20:20,369 --> 05:20:23,650
Take care of yourselves.

3507
05:20:23,650 --> 05:20:24,369
And goodbye.
