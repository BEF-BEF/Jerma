1
00:00:02,169 --> 00:00:28,070
Silence. Silence. The end. Okay. Explore the world. Let me get this on for you guys. We're just

2
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:43,829
gonna chill. I gotta change this to... what do I change this to? Winding down for a little bit

3
00:00:43,829 --> 00:01:09,819
and we'll... is GeoGuessy even on here? It is. GeoGuessy. Okay, that should be updated, I think.

4
00:01:19,129 --> 00:01:31,269
Uh, no, I need to... no, I need to capture the window. Not the browser. Add window. There we go.

5
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:59,719
Not that one. Which one is it? Why does somebody process this for this? What the hell? This is

6
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:08,819
a weird... um, it's gonna have to open some other window. For some strange reason it doesn't want to

7
00:02:08,819 --> 00:02:37,689
work. Okay, uh, let's try it again. Colon cam. Incoming colon cam. There it is. All right,

8
00:02:37,689 --> 00:02:52,789
that took a long enough. All right, I see things. I see things. Let's try not to get

9
00:02:52,789 --> 00:03:19,580
the ads in there though. There. We could do without the ever-changing ad. Okay. And then

10
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:38,009
let me get my camera on. That camera's way too big. Is this delayed? Shouldn't be. Hey guys,

11
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:52,620
how are you? Move this... I gotta move the camera to over here. Hold on. Sorry, I'm moving

12
00:03:52,620 --> 00:04:04,250
you around a lot. Let me see how that looks. How does that look? Well, that changed quickly.

13
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:31,430
Over here, right? Like this? Crazy eyes. Not in frame. I am now. And then we're gonna flip me.

14
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:46,439
Watch this. Ready? Take a look. Greasy hair. It's not greasy. It's just slippery. Okay. Geo

15
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:52,069
guesser. Are you ready to play? Look, I played Mr. Mosquito for like fucking two hours. Of

16
00:04:52,069 --> 00:05:03,910
course I'm gonna be sweating. All right, we can go. Thank you for your patience. Uh,

17
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:14,740
let's find out where we are in the world. All right, so we got, uh, walking... walking

18
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:25,100
person. Car? What's a car say? Let's just walk down the road. Somebody said Minecraft birch tree.

19
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:31,670
Look out for the car. I'm in a car. This is a... What is the kind of road is this? This is

20
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:43,350
small road. This is not in America. Is this two lanes or is this... You tell me a car comes

21
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:54,250
down here? No, we're on the right side of the road. Well, we'll find out. If a car

22
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:56,730
comes the other way, then we're not in America, but we're definitely not in America

23
00:05:56,730 --> 00:06:13,879
anyways. What does the sign say? Don't walk or crosswalk? No, this is definitely not

24
00:06:13,879 --> 00:06:36,139
America. The road's too narrow, but hold on a second here. Maybe it is. This is... this is...

25
00:06:36,139 --> 00:06:41,579
I think this might actually be somewhere in North America. That's not a Euro truck.

26
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:52,439
That's not... that's not a Euro truck. This is America. This is America or somewhere in North

27
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:59,180
America. We're on the right side of the road. Nobody else does that. We're one of the

28
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:25,769
places... only places on earth that does this. Keep going. Uh, what is this person doing?

29
00:07:25,769 --> 00:07:36,620
This is in... this is Russia. Passing? Who are they passing? Who are you passing? They were

30
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:45,589
passing the Google truck? I was gonna laugh if there was like a finger out the window.

31
00:07:45,589 --> 00:07:58,199
This couldn't handle it. You had to get around the Google truck. All right, so we're

32
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:11,459
somewhere in Russia, Ukraine. The aspect ratio is too stretched. Why? Because it's like

33
00:08:11,459 --> 00:08:24,939
squished. All right, hold on. Let me fix this. Why is this still on? Is that better?

34
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:30,310
I don't want to... okay, the reason why I don't have the whole thing out here is

35
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:34,139
because I don't want you to see this. I don't want you to see like the... all the ads that

36
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:57,779
I have to get. That's good. That's fine. Yeah, that's fine. That's fine. Look, ready?

37
00:08:57,779 --> 00:09:13,000
Now you don't even know. You can't even tell. This looks like we're watching a movie.

38
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:19,429
All right, so somewhere in Russia. Definitely not a cold part of Russia. Everybody's bad.

39
00:09:20,389 --> 00:09:23,110
People in Russia, man, you don't want to be behind the Google truck or in front of

40
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:36,090
whatever. Let me see here. Uh, let's just say... because, uh, I'm gonna say

41
00:09:36,889 --> 00:09:47,659
a lot of green down here. It's definitely not up here. Let me see if I can get a sign,

42
00:09:47,659 --> 00:09:55,769
although I can't read. So how am I gonna do that? It seems like outside of some... a very major

43
00:09:55,769 --> 00:10:11,700
city somehow. There's a lot of, uh, development over there. I'm gonna just say here. Challenge

44
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:17,740
your friends. How the... how the economic machine works. I don't remember getting ads.

45
00:10:18,299 --> 00:10:36,299
That wasn't that bad. I don't remember getting these ads. 3,000 kilometers. That's pretty...

46
00:10:36,299 --> 00:10:50,629
that's not bad. Considering how big Russia is. All right, next round. Why are the outsides of

47
00:10:50,629 --> 00:10:59,940
the windows blurred but not the part of the window that matters? The window part. I don't

48
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:06,889
know what you're trying to blur here. All right, let's take a look. Let's go down here. Uh,

49
00:11:07,769 --> 00:11:25,690
dirt road. Green, white house with a shed. Okay, let's get off the dirt road so I can see.

50
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:39,620
This looks like a little European town. Oh, another... look, a Euro truck, right?

51
00:11:40,259 --> 00:11:57,460
Is it prison? What does that say? I can't read that. I could get onto a highway or something this

52
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:08,700
way. All right, where we go? Okay, hold on. Kapampin. No, this is also... this is Russia.

53
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:33,850
This is also Russia. Is it? Is this Russia? Russia's always so hard because Russia's so

54
00:12:33,850 --> 00:13:04,779
huge. Russia is like 30% of the whole earth. Let's go down here, right? What is that? Oh,

55
00:13:04,779 --> 00:13:11,210
I thought that was an animal. What are you... what are they doing to this house?

56
00:13:11,769 --> 00:13:33,100
Is it... is it brick? Bricklaying. Interesting. Ireland? No, this is not Ireland. This is Russia.

57
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:48,980
I can't read that. There's nothing... I don't think there's anything there. I can't...

58
00:13:50,100 --> 00:14:05,419
there's no words there. I don't think this is like a major city. Maybe this...

59
00:14:05,419 --> 00:14:24,440
I'm like stuck on the dirt roads. This is... I don't know. Let's take a guess. White

60
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:40,230
intersection. Uh, no major city. It's gotta be like a town name or like a town center.

61
00:14:40,230 --> 00:15:08,779
Okay, hold on. What's this? Bank. That's a bank? Bank of... Ben? Bank of Russia. I don't

62
00:15:08,779 --> 00:15:33,320
think it's Bank of Russia. What about down here? Hold on. The thing... the thing about Russian,

63
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:37,159
maybe it's just because of the alphabet, right? We use the... we use the same alphabet,

64
00:15:37,159 --> 00:15:50,309
but I feel like I'm looking at words in a dream. You know what I mean? Like,

65
00:15:50,309 --> 00:15:53,750
I feel like I'm just... it's so upside down and backwards in my brain.

66
00:15:54,549 --> 00:16:02,629
Like, I feel... when I'm in a dream, I feel like this is what the letters look like in my

67
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:13,429
brain. Next time you have a dream, wake up. Next time you have a dream, look at... open up a book.

68
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:25,700
You'll see. All right, I'm going for it. It's the same place I guessed last time.

69
00:16:26,899 --> 00:16:36,309
That's like the same exact spot. It was the same... it was the same spot. It was just over

70
00:16:36,309 --> 00:16:42,649
here. No, I didn't... what am I clicking on? Why did it just load up an ad? It just like

71
00:16:42,649 --> 00:17:00,840
forced me into an ad. All right, here we go. Turn on your ad block. Does this site open

72
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:04,900
with an ad block? Is it Russia again? I don't know about that. This isn't... this might

73
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:23,700
not be Russia. This looks American. Yeah. This is... this is definitely American.

74
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:32,390
Somewhere in the Midwest. Give me a street sign. Give me a name. Give me a name. Anything.

75
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:42,140
Stop ahead. We're in America. Only in America will it warn you to make sure you understand

76
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:49,299
that you need to stop at a stop sign. Only in America is that possible. There's a stop sign

77
00:17:49,299 --> 00:18:05,319
before the stop sign. Divided highway, okay. That's a warning stop sign. American town in

78
00:18:05,319 --> 00:18:22,420
Russia. Oh, we've got Westby. That could be anything, though. Westby. But no, wait. Population

79
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:37,480
2,200 people. This is the middle of nowhere somewhere in the Midwest. Can we get a state,

80
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:42,500
though? Come on, let's go. Old town, motel, restaurant. There you go. You've got

81
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:56,470
Kansas's finest. Come on, right? Can't see. No. Galaxy? What about this side? Oh, hold on.

82
00:18:58,309 --> 00:19:11,670
Madison? Wisconsin. Is this Wisconsin? Madison, Wisconsin. So if Madison's 104 miles that way,

83
00:19:14,099 --> 00:19:33,720
where's Madison? Where is Madison, Wisconsin? Madison. It's 100 miles off of Madison. Which

84
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:45,799
way are we facing right now? This is important. That's my compass. So this is south. So we're

85
00:19:45,799 --> 00:20:00,009
going red means it's pointing, right? So this is south. This is like southeast. Wait, what do

86
00:20:00,009 --> 00:20:21,910
you mean? The red is the indicator, right? Or is white the indicator? Red is north. Why would

87
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:43,539
north, north up here? North is up. So this is north. This is northwest. So this is 104

88
00:20:43,539 --> 00:20:56,500
miles northwest of Madison. I don't use fucking compasses. Okay. Let's find Westby. So we have

89
00:20:56,500 --> 00:21:10,220
104 miles northwest. Westby. How much 104 miles? It's fucking up here, isn't it? Westby. Westby.

90
00:21:11,579 --> 00:21:31,460
Up here somewhere further. Westby. What road is this? If it's 104 miles on this road.

91
00:21:33,690 --> 00:22:00,329
What road? 14, 12. This might be 12. 18, 14. I'm gonna say like right up here. Warrens,

92
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:28,779
Thomas, Sparta, Whitehall, Melrose. It's like up here. Did I miss it? Wilton, Jefferson,

93
00:22:28,779 --> 00:22:55,420
Caston, Ontario. 5,000 points. Didn't get it by the street. I'm not looking to get it perfect.

94
00:22:55,420 --> 00:23:05,140
Did you enjoy this location? I've never been there. All right. That was good. That was a good

95
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:16,920
run. Hoots. Health Mart Pharmacy. Hoots. Still in America, I think. Let's find a city or town

96
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:41,619
center or something. Wilenskis. Wisconsin. No. Wilenskis Brothers. Saba. What is it? Head Start?

97
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:58,900
Saba. San Saba. What's? Wait. No, no, no, no. Hold on. What's down here? Bella?

98
00:23:59,539 --> 00:24:07,289
Oh, apparently not. Why would they like blur that out but then not blur it out?

99
00:24:08,009 --> 00:24:23,019
Okay. So this is obviously somewhere in America. Let's go up here. I'm not ready to take a

100
00:24:23,019 --> 00:24:35,660
guess. Decker. Decker Street. Recreation Club. The Busy Bee. Smart. This is all boarded up.

101
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:51,779
Recreation Club. Where? Okay. We're in Menard. Where is Menard? Looks like this is a school

102
00:24:51,779 --> 00:24:59,559
down here. Maybe they'll get a town name. Is it a pool? It's out here. Hold on. Wait, wait,

103
00:24:59,559 --> 00:25:17,500
wait. Menard Manor. Hotel in Menard Manor. Let me go down here. Right. School. We love

104
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:47,220
our children. Drive slow. Is it a church or a temple or? Let's go over here. Can I

105
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:52,180
can't go down there? All right. What about the school? Wait. Hold on. The Menard News.

106
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:56,900
A lot of these places love to have the name of where you are in the title of their.

107
00:25:56,900 --> 00:26:27,539
What's this? Okay. Weirdly enough. All right. The Menard Church of Christ. That's four

108
00:26:27,539 --> 00:26:45,799
churches. That was one, two, three, four. The elementary school. I think we've gone off

109
00:26:45,799 --> 00:27:17,750
there. Whoa. That's what made me puke. I got to get back to the businesses.

110
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:28,039
It's definitely somewhere in down south. Has to be. I went way too far away.

111
00:27:28,039 --> 00:28:14,980
I got to go back. Bowie is okay. Back over here. I'm gonna go all the way back. Menard

112
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:27,259
News. I feel like I can get this one. Jacket's Rule. These places don't even have a

113
00:28:27,259 --> 00:29:13,960
thing on them. Wait. First United Methodist Church. School of. What about back on the

114
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:45,980
main road? Ah. What we got? John. Eden. Eden. The land of Eden. Yeah. It's Texas.

115
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:52,200
Okay. Menard, Texas. Is that on the map where it is? Look at right there. Hold on.

116
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:58,730
Look at the little blip that's right there on the map. You see that? So like right here.

117
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:28,230
So that's here. Not very many towns here. Menard. Menard. Anybody see it? It's like

118
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:52,329
right here. Fucking told you the blip was going to help us here. All right. So hold

119
00:30:52,410 --> 00:31:01,349
on a minute here. Let's get this 100% accurate. Menard Manor. Right here. I'm

120
00:31:01,349 --> 00:31:13,220
gonna go stand at Menard Manor. And I'm gonna get 5,000 points. This is 100%. I'm

121
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:25,369
literally standing out the front door of Menard Manor. We're here. We made it. Wait. It's

122
00:31:25,369 --> 00:31:34,259
where you started. It's based on where you spawned. I don't remember even where I spawned.

123
00:31:34,259 --> 00:31:38,549
Starting location? That was up here and to the left, right? So if we're looking at

124
00:31:38,549 --> 00:31:55,980
Menard Manor, we go to the left. Now we're on 2092. Press the flag. Okay. All right.

125
00:31:55,980 --> 00:32:02,200
All right. Okay. And now I had it right. There's Menard Manor. We're like right here.

126
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:15,420
First State Bank. It's like right here. Ranch House Meat Company. Hoots. First State Bank.

127
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:44,809
Chamber of Commerce. It's right there. It was like 10 feet. 5,000 points. That was a good

128
00:32:44,809 --> 00:32:53,109
one. That was two good ones back to back. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Commerce.

129
00:32:53,750 --> 00:33:08,440
That would be a real boring fucking movie. All right. Another sign. It said Menard. That would

130
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:14,200
be if it was... I hate being out in the middle of nowhere because you almost just have

131
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:22,519
to go in a straight line till you get to a junction of civilization. There are no houses

132
00:33:22,519 --> 00:33:29,640
out here. There's nothing even out here. Look. One guy lives out here. One guy lives out here.

133
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:46,579
You know what I think is really weird about something like GeoGuessr is the amount of

134
00:33:46,579 --> 00:33:50,099
probably the hundreds of thousands if not millions of people that have played this game.

135
00:33:52,890 --> 00:33:56,329
Millions of clicks and the millions of refreshing and new locations.

136
00:33:56,970 --> 00:34:05,819
How many times has somebody walked by your house? How many people have looked in your

137
00:34:05,819 --> 00:34:20,550
window? That's weird. You were in my hometown last time you played. See that's

138
00:34:21,429 --> 00:34:32,260
that's crazy. Wait what what's going on? What happened in chat?

139
00:34:39,559 --> 00:34:48,469
I was in your house the last time I played. What is it? Creepy pasta? I don't understand.

140
00:34:48,469 --> 00:35:07,400
Somebody trying to put in creepy pastas? People are posting creepy

141
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:23,989
ASCII art. It's a meme thing. Do that in your own house. Hey do that in your own house.

142
00:35:24,550 --> 00:36:04,980
I am in my house. All right what we got here? TWP road San Do San Dio. Oh my god. What is over

143
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:44,539
here? What is stored in there? What is over there? It's it's corn. Just like hurts my eyes.

144
00:36:44,539 --> 00:36:49,190
I don't like the resolution in this city. Whatever it is. I got the bad graphics settings

145
00:36:49,190 --> 00:37:07,719
in this city. What's that? Something up here. I can't even go this far. Why does it end

146
00:37:07,719 --> 00:37:23,000
here? Was the google truck afraid to go down here? All right I that was weird. End of the world.

147
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:28,099
We're gonna get we're gonna get to the end. We're gonna get to go look over and see the

148
00:37:28,099 --> 00:37:56,469
space. That's the end of the earth. You're gonna go you're gonna go like whoa whoa. I have

149
00:37:56,469 --> 00:38:17,099
no idea what the hell I am. The earth is shaped like a velociraptor. I just the thing

150
00:38:17,099 --> 00:38:23,500
I don't understand is if the earth is 70% water why doesn't it just fall out and go

151
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:28,219
into space? When you pour a glass of water it goes straight down and you spills all over

152
00:38:28,219 --> 00:38:35,260
the place. So if we're 70% water and we're you know like why is the water not just out in space?

153
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:09,429
Earth's mass holds the water here with gravity. I don't know about that. Gravity is something

154
00:39:09,429 --> 00:39:13,909
I put on my potatoes and you're telling me that's yeah you also put that delicious tastiest

158
00:40:15,909 --> 00:40:32,250
sub mode. Maybe if you're good I won't have to do it. Subs are doing it too. I am okay with

159
00:40:33,559 --> 00:40:37,800
if you're a sub that doesn't mean that you get to break rules and spam and

160
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:42,840
just because you're a subscriber you still got to follow the rules. They're down there

235
00:56:56,599 --> 00:57:17,059
It really is. How do I do it? You gotta like lift your head up and go. When do I plan on ending my

236
00:57:17,059 --> 00:57:31,909
streaming career? I haven't thought about that. When I'm no longer having fun. That's real. When

237
00:57:31,909 --> 00:57:36,070
I'm no longer enjoying what I'm doing. When I'm not having fun anymore. When I'm not enjoying

238
00:57:36,070 --> 00:57:49,500
it anymore. I'm not gonna do it. You know. I'm not gonna give you. There's no time for it

239
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:55,300

240
00:57:55,300 --> 00:58:10,150
tomorrow. I could wake up tomorrow and be like, well, not tomorrow. Don't do it tomorrow. Tomorrow

241
00:58:10,150 --> 00:58:20,019
is my birthday. No, I would. Okay, look, we would do. Here's what's gonna happen. I know it's not

242
00:58:20,019 --> 00:58:23,300

243
00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:30,889
story. I know. Listen, when I'm done, I will make it very clear. I'll make it incredibly

244
00:58:30,889 --> 00:58:35,929
clear. I'm gonna be like, guys, we've had a really, really great time. I've been doing

245
00:58:35,929 --> 00:58:43,530
this for like 25 years. I like to spend some time with my seven children. You know,

246
00:58:44,949 --> 00:59:43,780

248
01:00:09,590 --> 01:00:21,590

249
01:00:21,590 --> 01:00:29,260
doing that. Stop. What the hell? Let me see this. Oh my God. They bug in the fucking game's code.

250
01:00:29,260 --> 01:00:42,250
The collision detection in this part of the world is just not very good. It was Barberville,

251
01:00:42,250 --> 01:00:49,099
but no, no fucking around. No joking around. When I'm done, whenever that is,

252
01:00:50,250 --> 01:00:54,090
I'll give everybody plenty of notice because what I don't want to have happen is to be like,

253
01:00:54,650 --> 01:00:59,860
oh, hey, guys, I'm done. I'll see you later. I mean, there are people that, you know,

254
01:00:59,860 --> 01:01:04,099
maybe just to subscribe to something like, I want to give you like a long time to know that's

255
01:01:04,099 --> 01:01:17,980
coming. But I don't just, whenever that happens, it happens. I don't foresee it happening for a

256
01:01:17,980 --> 01:01:36,219
while. Don't say anything and just disappear for five years. Burning out. I spend a very

257
01:01:36,219 --> 01:01:48,599
large amount of my energy making sure I don't burn out. Injured. Is this Vegas? Those are

258
01:01:48,599 --> 01:02:10,489
everywhere. Anti-burnout. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, you guys know that. I take a lot of time

259
01:02:10,489 --> 01:02:18,219
off. You know, like for instance, after this, I'm going to just take two days off. That's not

260
01:02:18,219 --> 01:02:23,500
because I just want to make sure that I'm like ready to go. You know, I take time off each week

261
01:02:26,949 --> 01:02:32,789
specifically to prevent the feeling of like burning out and being like, I got a stream.

262
01:02:32,789 --> 01:02:35,909
I want to do this. I want to do that. I'm getting, it's too much. It's too much. It's

263
01:02:35,909 --> 01:02:51,829
too much because it can, that can happen. What does that say? This is like home of 2015

270
01:04:03,179 --> 01:04:53,300
I have my guess. That was so close. Oh, we did it again. I'm just like, I can sell,

271
01:04:53,300 --> 01:04:59,059
I can sell it. I can put an M in there after the S. I can just, you know, I can taste it.

272
01:05:00,900 --> 01:05:21,260
Kibbe Dome. This looks, this looks kind of like New England. It does. I feel like I'm in New

273
01:05:21,260 --> 01:05:43,239
England. Did I recognize anything? Subs go that way. Student Rec. I'm in like a college.

274
01:05:43,800 --> 01:06:03,159
What college am I in? This is a college. Stadium. University of Idaho. All right,

275
01:06:03,159 --> 01:06:10,460
where's the University of Idaho? I don't really feel like I'm in New England.

276
01:06:10,460 --> 01:06:26,389
Where's the University of Idaho? I know it's in Idaho. What are you looking at? I love how

277
01:06:26,389 --> 01:06:55,690
they blurred this out too. Campus Walk. Whoa, what a cool campus. This is just basketball hoops

278
01:06:55,690 --> 01:07:16,659
on the walk. In my college we just played a game of who could put the head in the trash can

279
01:07:16,659 --> 01:07:35,019
the longest without throwing up. That's all we had. No, of course I didn't win. This is

280
01:07:35,019 --> 01:07:41,500
not a drinking thing. This is just a thing thing. It's like, ah, I'm bored. Me, I'm

281
01:07:41,500 --> 01:07:48,820
bored too. I'm very bored. You want to play, you want to play smell the can? Uh, yeah, sure. I don't

282
01:07:48,820 --> 01:08:05,349
got class for like another 40 minutes. I need like a city. It's gonna be like admissions or

283
01:08:05,349 --> 01:08:13,530
something. Teaching and Learning Center. Why don't you just name this the Education Center?

284
01:08:13,530 --> 01:08:22,890
Isn't that too wordy? The Teaching and Learning Center? The Education Center. Too many words.

285
01:08:34,180 --> 01:08:43,180
Idaho Comm. I gotta get out of the college. It looks like the exit. I gotta find the

286
01:08:43,180 --> 01:08:59,909
signs and find the exit. Is this Campus Walk? No, it's over here. Life Sciences. This way.

287
01:08:59,909 --> 01:09:25,750
University. Let's get out. Out. Out. University. Get out. Admission. No, I get me out of the

288
01:09:25,750 --> 01:09:46,710
college. How big is this college? All right, I made it. Welcome to Moscow. Moscow, Idaho.

289
01:09:46,789 --> 01:10:01,850
Okay, so it is Russia. We were right. Every time. Watch this be actually in Russia. No,

290
01:10:01,850 --> 01:10:10,279
that would be impossible. All right, Moscow, Idaho. Let's go look it up. What do you guys

291
01:10:10,279 --> 01:10:16,579
think? Do you think it's um, I'm just realizing this right now. Idaho is just a gigantic flipped

292
01:10:16,579 --> 01:10:40,500
New Hampshire. It's weird. Moscow. Okay, Moscow. We're looking for Moscow. Oh, get out of

293
01:10:40,500 --> 01:10:57,020
here. University. Where is it? University of Idaho. I'll take 5,000 points please. All right,

294
01:10:57,020 --> 01:11:15,930
that's close enough. What's going on here? What's this weird? Did somebody ran my camera over with

295
01:11:15,930 --> 01:11:46,739
a green tire? Why did we get slimed? This camera's broken. 55 speed limit? No, that's

296
01:11:46,739 --> 01:11:53,670
too easy to do that. It's too easy to just bait everybody here to say like, oh look at

297
01:11:53,670 --> 01:11:58,390
those dogs or something like that. Everyone's going to be like, what? That's way too easy.

298
01:11:59,029 --> 01:12:22,090
Look at those lions. This camera is pissing me off. Road may flood. This really is just

299
01:12:22,649 --> 01:12:34,170
almost like concrete how flat this all is. Yeah, I even get like the urge to just sprint

300
01:12:34,729 --> 01:12:40,789
just this way. Just drink a bunch of water and just run as fast as you fucking possibly

301
01:12:40,789 --> 01:12:55,430
can that way. Or just like a sled. You know, one of those body boogie board sleds,

302
01:12:57,270 --> 01:13:02,390
just cover in oil and just sprint as fast as you fucking can and just jump and slide and you

303
01:13:02,390 --> 01:13:13,939
probably go the whole thing. You know, go get in a bowling alley, cover the bowling alley bed

304
01:13:13,939 --> 01:13:18,789
thing with oil and slide on it. I made this fucking joke two days ago, except it was a

305
01:13:18,789 --> 01:13:33,399
much smaller scale. Have we got signs? No. Yeah, this is out. This is out like here

306
01:13:33,399 --> 01:13:45,159
somewhere. This is like, who fucking has any idea? We could be on this road for miles.

307
01:13:48,340 --> 01:13:54,069
This is scary to, all right, those of you guys that live in a place like this,

308
01:13:54,069 --> 01:14:02,600
an area like this, aren't you afraid to go anywhere? You need a full tank of gas.

309
01:14:03,319 --> 01:14:13,529
If you don't have a full tank, this is scary. Even if you have a full tank of gas,

310
01:14:19,609 --> 01:14:25,720
you, something happens out here. Wait, what are you going to go? You're going to walk?

311
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:35,399
You better get your sprinting ability up because you're going to have to go that way.

312
01:14:39,270 --> 01:14:51,220
Okay. What about, I would feel like I would want like extra gas. It'd be terrifying.

313
01:14:51,220 --> 01:15:02,229
I'll fill the tank up. Can I put like six tanks of gas in my back seat? I would be

314
01:15:02,229 --> 01:15:17,699
scared to do this. I would. I would be scared. I'd be scared. Kent, we are in Kent,

315
01:15:19,479 --> 01:15:32,439
Kent, Nebraska or something. Kent, Nebraska, Kent. Okay. We're in Kent, but where, what is Kent?

316
01:15:42,840 --> 01:15:53,300
What is that? Is that, is this a handmade, a homemade helicopter? This is a flying machine.

317
01:15:53,859 --> 01:16:02,100
This is a homemade flying machine. Oh no, it's perspective. It's going that way. Okay. I

318
01:16:02,100 --> 01:16:10,229
thought this was like one unit. Okay. I thought this was one thing. Okay. No, it's

319
01:16:10,229 --> 01:16:25,130
just like a watering centipede. It's a centipede irrigator. I get it. Look at those dogs. Look at

320
01:16:25,130 --> 01:16:57,539
those dogs. Kent, a human irrigator. What would a human irrigator be this way or that way? Would

321
01:16:57,539 --> 01:17:06,899
you like just put water in your mouth and just spray it? All right. Time to take a guess. I

322
01:17:06,899 --> 01:17:15,140
think this is like somewhere in like Oklahoma, Kentucky, Dakota, one of the Dakotas. What's

323
01:17:15,140 --> 01:17:32,329
that say? Does that say Alabama? Does that say Alabama? Dot Alabama? Alabama? Oh, it's right

324
01:17:32,329 --> 01:17:49,899
here. North. I can't see. Oh, train! That was bad. I know. Look, people are just doing

325
01:17:49,899 --> 01:18:10,380
ASCII art in the channel and I had to, I've been paying attention to that. No joke, until I

326
01:18:10,380 --> 01:18:25,079
was 17, I thought it was Abba Llama. No, no, not me. Somebody in chat said that. I'm

327
01:18:25,079 --> 01:18:38,380
repeating what somebody said. Speaking of llamas, here they are. That's a lot of them.

328
01:18:38,380 --> 01:18:55,270
What does that sign say? I'm about to give up and just fucking guess. Arcadia, Kansas. Arcadia,

329
01:18:55,270 --> 01:19:15,340
Kansas. Arcadia. It's a long road. I'm going to say over here. Arcadia. Opica.

330
01:19:15,340 --> 01:20:13,829
Arcadia. California. Arcadia. Garden City. Dodge City. Jaxmoor. It was in Missouri.

331
01:20:13,829 --> 01:20:28,899
Oh, there's the liberal. Okay, so we weren't in something called Kent. It was close. Close enough.

332
01:20:28,899 --> 01:20:53,079
We go that way. We've got to turn. We're gonna go backwards now. Okay, this is Russia. Again,

333
01:20:53,079 --> 01:21:07,189
same signs. Remember these signs? Russia. Good luck. Yeah, those are universal Russian signs.

334
01:21:07,189 --> 01:21:22,840
I don't know. I have no idea what that is. I don't know what that means. Does this mean

335
01:21:22,840 --> 01:21:28,329
the cars are coming real? Okay, here's what I get from this. Cars on the other side of the

336
01:21:28,329 --> 01:21:34,760
road have a much higher speed limit than our side here. So cars on this side are going to

337
01:21:34,760 --> 01:21:42,699
be going like 80. So be aware of that because it's like 25-30 on this side. And the top is

338
01:21:42,699 --> 01:21:53,130
just like a wine bottle. Or does that... Okay, so that means that the road narrows to a point

339
01:21:53,930 --> 01:21:57,529
where you have to go like one mile per hour through a tiny little opening.

340
01:22:10,359 --> 01:22:24,779
More just like cars on the side of the road. Who owns these cars? Just nothing from

341
01:22:24,779 --> 01:22:48,390
miles. This is this person's house. That's squished. What does this one say? This says

342
01:22:54,789 --> 01:23:17,050
300 miles to... I don't know. What the hell are they talking about?

343
01:23:17,850 --> 01:23:24,899
If you drink two cups of coffee a day, it helps with dry eyes. It wasn't that bad.

344
01:23:25,460 --> 01:23:34,859
This is Ukraine. All right. Did all right over here in America. Not so good over here.

345
01:23:34,939 --> 01:23:38,380
Actually, yeah, it's beside... Russia is... I'm telling you, Russia is hard mode.

346
01:23:40,199 --> 01:24:02,840
I'll do one more. Let's do one more. Same app. Let's go. Now, this is absolutely New England.

347
01:24:02,840 --> 01:24:11,180
Yes, it is. This is New England somewhere. I'd be shocked if it wasn't. This is definitely

348
01:24:11,180 --> 01:24:42,630
New England. How do I know? You just know. Yeah, you just know. Let's get to a main road.

349
01:24:42,630 --> 01:24:58,949
Got like boats in the driveways. That's a big tell. The style of house. This is not

350
01:24:58,949 --> 01:25:52,729
Florida. Let me do a main road. Okay, get out here. Can't see it from there. All right. All

351
01:25:52,729 --> 01:25:58,020
right. All right. Here we go. Here we go. All right. Here we go. This is it. This is

352
01:25:59,720 --> 01:26:30,979
definitely... This is like Cape Cod. This is Cape Cod, Massachusetts. I've seen a lot of

353
01:26:30,979 --> 01:26:48,329
orange plates. That's Halloween. So this is Halloween on Cape Cod. Guys, this is...

354
01:26:48,329 --> 01:27:02,569
Look at this shit. You telling me this is not New England? Here we go. Back it up. Back

355
01:27:02,569 --> 01:27:13,909
it up. Back it up. Back it up. Back it up. Back it up. I gotta get this one. Watch out.

356
01:27:13,909 --> 01:27:42,090
Risotto. Eatery. Italian eatery. Howard. Hector's Hardware. What's this? Tim Hor...

357
01:27:42,090 --> 01:28:38,069
It's Canada. 800. Benchmark. Eyecare Vision Center. School. School. School. School.

358
01:28:45,699 --> 01:29:22,779
I was right. I was right. I live here. Oh yeah, where is it then? Aggressive

359
01:29:22,779 --> 01:29:42,390
Har... Oh, it's a law firm called JEP. Robo Mart. Mighty Taco. I was right. Benderson.

360
01:29:43,029 --> 01:29:58,359
Benderson. Sounds like a name that I came up with. This looks like Massachusetts.

361
01:29:58,359 --> 01:30:24,979
Oh, go back into the town square. This way. Spectrum. Oh shit. This is not Massachusetts.

362
01:30:24,979 --> 01:30:38,380
Spectrum's not in Massachusetts. You know how I know that? Because it's just fucking Comcast.

363
01:30:39,659 --> 01:31:14,840
There's a pocket this big for Verizon. No, no! Let's go this way. I got it. They're gonna be

364
01:31:14,840 --> 01:31:45,430
transporting animals. Buffalo. That's down here. Would your child even know if they had

365
01:31:45,430 --> 01:31:51,430
poor vision? One in four children have undiagnosed vision problems. Come and spend like 600 bucks.

366
01:31:51,430 --> 01:32:11,880
I thought that was somebody in the window. I think a leaf hit the camera in the face.

367
01:32:15,100 --> 01:32:25,079
What happened to this camera? Somebody like... Is the Incredible Hulk grabbing the lens right

368
01:32:25,079 --> 01:32:37,340
now? This is like a Hulk smash right here. Well, we're gonna go this way because I can't see that

369
01:32:37,340 --> 01:33:38,340
way. All right. Dr. Dr. Expedito. Dr. Expedito. Okay, so this is... Hulk out of my face. Okay,

370
01:33:38,340 --> 01:34:35,579
this is... What does it say? Oficina Sal Severo e Servus e... More... I'd love to do this

371
01:34:35,579 --> 01:34:52,619
one. It's somewhere in South America. Sign over there. Let's see if I can see it. It's got this

372
01:34:52,619 --> 01:35:10,789
terrible view. Wrap around. Sign right here. There was a billboard here. What's this? I can't

373
01:35:10,789 --> 01:35:40,630
go down there. Okay, here we go. What do we got? I want to see that one. Curao de Cima.

374
01:35:45,050 --> 01:36:46,949
Queria Sao Jose. Sao Jose. The Bitcoin? Brazil. Brazil. Sao Jose, Brazil. Brazil's huge.

375
01:36:56,100 --> 01:37:08,220
There's a lot of... There's a lot of places in Brazil. Wait, Sao... That's Rio de Janeiro.

376
01:37:27,289 --> 01:37:40,409
What does it say here? Let's just guess. No, I thought it was closer to Rio de Janeiro.

377
01:37:40,409 --> 01:37:48,420
This is up here. I didn't even say it, too, and it's a completely different name. All right,

378
01:37:48,420 --> 01:38:36,630
next round. Another gigantic highway in Russia. No, stop! So every single time it's been Russia,

379
01:38:36,630 --> 01:38:52,819
it's been the same spot. Maybe it's just never over here. All right, Russia, because that's

380
01:38:52,819 --> 01:39:04,840
where the people live. Oh, okay. That makes it a little easier. You're clicking in the

381
01:39:04,840 --> 01:39:13,449
Russian desert. Everybody in Russia lives in the same spot. There's no life east of Moscow.

382
01:39:13,449 --> 01:39:30,220
I just keep clicking on the wilderness. Putin... Is this Russia again? That was just like Putin-ski.

383
01:39:30,220 --> 01:39:45,579
There it is. There it is on the treasure map. It's right here. Dig here. You'll find it.

384
01:39:45,579 --> 01:40:28,460
Coffee, rent, gas, or hardware? Mutine. I don't think this is Russia. I don't think so.

385
01:40:28,460 --> 01:40:48,520
Duxtos. Duxtos sounds like the name of the town or the place. Duxtos or Duxtos. Same deal.

386
01:40:50,300 --> 01:40:59,939
Further down. Much further. Much further. Much further. It's Duxtos Rio de Janeiro. I don't think

387
01:40:59,939 --> 01:41:21,300
it is. Food and lodging? That's a tree next to a stool. I don't know what that means.

388
01:41:29,590 --> 01:41:43,699
Why is it blurred out? All right, I'm gonna get off the highway here. Here we go. Here's some

389
01:41:43,699 --> 01:41:49,579
more signs and civilization. Golf, swimming. All right, this is a recreational spot. Let's

390
01:41:49,579 --> 01:42:44,939
get over here. What's that? The Meridian. The Meridian. The Le Meridian. Taxi. We're in

391
01:42:44,939 --> 01:43:01,399
Europe. I just don't know where. I gotta get off the highway. I feel like we're gonna be

392
01:43:01,399 --> 01:43:25,180
on this highway for a long time. Now we're opening up into driving through nowhere. I'm

393
01:43:25,180 --> 01:43:53,210
going for it. I think I got it. I think I got it. At least close. Yep, Lithuania. I was

394
01:43:53,210 --> 01:44:02,100
thinking Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania, Belarus. I didn't read chat for that one. Who wrote that?

395
01:44:02,100 --> 01:44:14,100
Nobody did. Cheating. You can say that for everything, okay? Everything could be he read

396
01:44:14,100 --> 01:44:22,329
it in chat. Everything. I don't get any credit. I love when I beat last boss,

397
01:44:22,329 --> 01:44:28,250
Sekiro, and I did it. And you can't say that you read chat. You did it. I did that.

398
01:44:28,810 --> 01:44:45,449
It makes me like, I did that. Remember that? We certainly helped. All right, this is the last

399
01:44:45,449 --> 01:44:58,380
one. And then I'm gonna take off. Thank you for joining me on this relaxing stream. Okay,

400
01:44:58,380 --> 01:45:09,819
I thought that was a tank. So that's a big tank. I have no idea what the hell this is.

401
01:45:17,829 --> 01:45:40,359
Man filter. Okay. Man filter. Is this in English? Is it $33 a gallon? No, this is Russia.

402
01:45:59,779 --> 01:46:10,600
Close. Close enough. View the summary. What we got. It would have been, actually,

403
01:46:10,680 --> 01:46:15,880
I would have been really good. The only big outlier was this. Me clicking on the middle

404
01:46:15,880 --> 01:46:22,760
of nowhere. I would have been up here. That would have been good. And that's it. We're

405
01:46:22,760 --> 01:46:36,420
gonna do the bits. And I will see you all for some more VR on Tuesday. Tuesday. That one

406
01:46:36,420 --> 01:46:46,220
doesn't count? Yeah, it does. Thank you to CAD for the amazing Jerma Slots game. There was a

407
01:46:46,220 --> 01:46:50,649
lot more content in there than I think any of us ever could have imagined. So thank you

408
01:46:50,649 --> 01:46:55,979
to those of you that worked on that game. It was great. Mr. Mosquito was actually really

409
01:46:55,979 --> 01:47:06,390
interesting until that last level. And then, yeah, just another relaxing kind of chill day.

410
01:47:08,569 --> 01:47:18,899
VR is coming back. You've raged quite a porn game. Well, good. That's not a big deal.

411
01:47:26,199 --> 01:47:38,380
Let me move this off. Hey, you want some, like, radiance? That makeup ad has showed up.

412
01:47:38,380 --> 01:47:43,180
I've given that, you guys have already seen ads. Give ads. You've seen this one already,

413
01:47:43,180 --> 01:47:57,909
like, 30 or 40 times. So you already had ads. But I'll see you guys later. See you guys in

414
01:47:57,909 --> 01:48:08,789
a couple days. On Tuesday, to be specific. Thank you everybody for coming out. Back to

415
01:48:08,789 --> 01:48:24,149
the virtual world on Tuesday. Let us move this window here. And let's do the bits

416
01:48:25,109 --> 01:48:34,069
from earlier, about six hours ago. What am I going to do in VR? Mind show. I'm going

417
01:48:34,069 --> 01:48:38,630
to just start. We're just going to do mind show. I'm just going to start and do a

418
01:48:38,630 --> 01:48:43,130
full stream in mind show. I've been putting it off because I know it's going to be a lot of

419
01:48:43,130 --> 01:48:53,539
fun. So I want to have a dedicated day to it. The only reason why I would not do it then

420
01:48:54,180 --> 01:48:56,979
is to do it on a weekend or something. But let's just let's just go for it.

421
01:49:00,069 --> 01:49:10,300
But thank you too, to start it off our Lazy Luke with the $7777.77. Thank you. I've got

422
01:49:10,300 --> 01:49:14,460
footage of you this morning realizing that you can't gamble your life savings on stream.

423
01:49:16,069 --> 01:49:38,439
What is this? This is called another one of those videos. Thank you Lazy Luke for the

424
01:49:38,439 --> 01:49:49,289
$7777. Appreciate it. Also thank you to Clive Ripp. Thank you with $5. These bits are to

425
01:49:49,289 --> 01:50:03,050
give italics a wet willy. Thank you for the $5. How about I'll tell italics a funny joke instead.

426
01:50:04,810 --> 01:50:11,159
Thank you for the five bucks. Hey Smelly Boy, thanks for the $250. Hope you realize this is

427
01:50:11,159 --> 01:50:18,630
a borderline fetish game. Look, I played it for like an hour and a half and I realized

428
01:50:18,630 --> 01:50:28,550
that I didn't want to play it anymore so I stopped playing it. Thank you for the $250.

429
01:50:31,319 --> 01:50:41,369
Avev, thanks for the 10 bucks. Why are you naked if this isn't a porn game? I don't know. Thank

430
01:50:41,369 --> 01:50:54,630
you for the $10 Avev. Dorkcube, thanks for the $250. Holy cow, Cad is an absolute legend. Hope

431
01:50:54,630 --> 01:51:17,699
you make more games dude. I do too. Something to discuss because that was fantastic. Cad's still

432
01:51:17,699 --> 01:51:29,449
here. No, that was a funny little easter egg joke thing that he did. But thank you

433
01:51:29,449 --> 01:51:36,409
Dorkcube and yes again thank you to Cad. This is insane. Magical Marissa, another $10 on top of the

434
01:51:36,409 --> 01:51:48,380
$60 you've already given tonight. Thank you for 10 more dollars here. They say auto. Auto. By the way,

435
01:51:49,739 --> 01:51:57,529
Cad did mention that that game he's going to try to release it at the end of this stream.

436
01:51:58,470 --> 01:52:03,270
But it might have to wait till Monday because of the way Steam works. So if it's not up

437
01:52:03,350 --> 01:52:09,859
today for you just to download and play it however long you want, it will be available early next

438
01:52:09,859 --> 01:52:14,420
week. Right? Is that correct? I want to make sure that's correct. Dermislots is the game we're

439
01:52:14,420 --> 01:52:21,880
talking about. Showcased it on stream earlier. One is the scratch off. I'll make it clear one

440
01:52:21,880 --> 01:52:25,960
more time because I know people are kind of trickling in and out. I cannot do the scratch

441
01:52:25,960 --> 01:52:31,319
ticket thing in Nevada because there's no state lottery in Nevada. I did not know that

442
01:52:31,319 --> 01:52:36,680
until this morning. So I cannot physically buy a scratch ticket. They do not exist

443
01:52:36,680 --> 01:52:41,720
in the state of Nevada, unfortunately. I did not even know that until this morning.

444
01:52:43,420 --> 01:52:53,859
So we will cross that bridge again. I have to drive to California. Road trip stream.

445
01:52:58,630 --> 01:53:05,289
But thank you to omgtayon for the 250. Derma this is your family. We're all worried about

446
01:53:05,289 --> 01:53:12,970
you and your gambling addiction you've developed. Please leave Las Vegas and come home. We hit

447
01:53:12,970 --> 01:53:21,659
it though. We cheated but we hit it. Zanziman thanks for the 10 bucks. Derma I know it's not

448
01:53:21,659 --> 01:53:34,140
much but here you need it more than me. Thank you for the 10 dollars. Zany. I think it's not

449
01:53:34,140 --> 01:53:42,729
it's not Zanziman. It's Zany Zman. Appreciate the 10 bucks. Super Seal thanks for 250. Please

450
01:53:42,729 --> 01:53:46,010
highlight this stream so that future generations can watch you play the best game ever.

451
01:53:47,109 --> 01:53:55,109
Whether I'm referring to Mr. Mosquito or Derma Slots is up to you. It will be saved

452
01:53:55,109 --> 01:54:01,579
forever. Ferodian weapon thanks for five dollars Ferodian. Hope you're having a good night. I

453
01:54:01,579 --> 01:54:04,859
thought I'd contribute to your gambling addiction but seriously this game looks amazing. It even

454
01:54:04,859 --> 01:54:13,720
makes me want to gamble. That's not that that was not my intention. If you're going to gamble

455
01:54:14,979 --> 01:54:20,710
hopefully that you follow some very very basic rules. Rule number one make sure it's legal

456
01:54:20,710 --> 01:54:27,210
where you live. Make sure you're old enough and it's legal. Rule number two if you're

457
01:54:27,210 --> 01:54:33,239
going to gamble make sure you go into gambling with going to a casino or whatever you're doing.

458
01:54:34,460 --> 01:54:40,619
Moderate yourself. Make sure you're doing it for fun not to actually make money. Do not try to

459
01:54:40,619 --> 01:54:50,039
gamble to try to make money. He's promoting gambling. No I'm trying to be I'm trying to

460
01:54:50,039 --> 01:55:08,789
promote responsible gaming. Just go to a casino and bet 221 dollars on roulette for black. That'd

461
01:55:08,789 --> 01:55:13,880
be bad. That's the worst thing you could probably do but yeah thank you Ferodian for

462
01:55:13,880 --> 01:55:21,699
the five dollars. Game responsibly. Tara Alekhren thanks for the three bucks.

463
01:55:22,439 --> 01:55:28,520
Jerma I've been subbed for 32 months. Only a few more months until I'm in the three year club.

464
01:55:29,239 --> 01:55:35,000
You got any plans for a three year sub badge so I can lord it over the filthy one and two year

465
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:47,579
plebs? Yes three years. Holy shit that's so long. Thank you Tara Alekhren for the continued

466
01:55:47,579 --> 01:55:52,789
support forever. That's forever. That's as long as I've been streaming on twitch. I've been

467
01:55:52,789 --> 01:56:02,699
streaming on twitch for about three and a half years. Four years almost. But yes there will be

468
01:56:02,699 --> 01:56:14,069
three, six, twelve years whatever is available. You know the word I was trying to say. Thank you

469
01:56:14,069 --> 01:56:17,590
something rather for the 250. How much will it take for you to release your hostages? I don't

470
01:56:17,590 --> 01:56:27,289
have any hostages. Thank you for the 250. Pika Banana thanks for the 10 bucks. It's too bad

471
01:56:27,289 --> 01:56:31,210
the scratches didn't work out but this has been an amazing stream anyway. You never failed

472
01:56:31,210 --> 01:56:41,319
to crack me up. Love you Jerma Jerma Heart. Thank you for the 10 dollars and the incredibly

473
01:56:41,319 --> 01:56:50,069
kind message. I had a lot of fun tonight. It was a just a it was like a shower a an absolute

474
01:56:50,069 --> 01:56:59,750
shower of smiles that were on my face. It was great. Thank you for the 10 dollars

475
01:56:59,750 --> 01:57:05,699
and supporting the stream. Dorkcube thanks for the 250. After watching you play Risk of Rain

476
01:57:05,699 --> 01:57:11,060
2 I decided to try it. Unfortunately my laptop is garbage so I had to turn down all the

477
01:57:11,060 --> 01:57:18,020
graphics settings. Did you know the game allows you to turn the textures to 1 30 1 32nd of their

478
01:57:18,020 --> 01:57:26,420
full size? A 30 I can't even read that. 1 32th. What does that mean? How do I say this?

479
01:57:26,979 --> 01:57:39,430
1 30th? How do you say this? Phonetically just put it in the chat. 1 32nd? But that doesn't

480
01:57:39,430 --> 01:57:57,220
sound right. 1 32nd. I had it right the first time. It just sounds sounds weird to say it.

481
01:57:57,859 --> 01:58:08,810
But thank you Dorkcube. Risk of Rain 2 is a lot of fun. I'm glad you're able to at least play it.

482
01:58:08,810 --> 01:58:13,289
Tara Alecran thanks for the three dollars. If he isn't holding Cad hostage then why won't

483
01:58:13,289 --> 01:58:18,649
he show his basement on stream right now? We see through your lies Jerma. Free Cad.

484
01:58:19,449 --> 01:58:25,369
Well there's a funny thing to rebuttal this with. There is no such thing as a basement

485
01:58:25,369 --> 01:58:41,979
in Las Vegas. The judge just tore up the prosecution and threw it in the air.

486
01:58:41,979 --> 01:59:01,609
There are no basements in Las Vegas. Oh that's real convenient. No scratch tickets. No basement.

487
01:59:01,609 --> 01:59:10,920
This is starting to sound fake as hell. We've seen zero proof that you're in Las Vegas.

488
01:59:12,710 --> 01:59:17,350
Except for the balloon landing when I was surrounded by mountains and desert.

489
01:59:22,520 --> 01:59:31,029
It was faked. It was a green screen. I'll end up doing a weird Las Vegas stream. Don't worry.

490
01:59:33,270 --> 01:59:37,109
I'll be out there. There'll be some weird scenario. Well you're gonna see like the

491
01:59:37,109 --> 01:59:51,699
whole strip or something maybe. But thank you Smelly Boy for the 250. GeoGuessr is unironically

492
01:59:51,699 --> 01:59:58,470
my favorite game to watch you play. It's not a joke when we ask you to play. I know and I have

493
01:59:58,470 --> 02:00:01,510
fun playing it and I think it's a lot it's a relaxing interesting fun game we can just kind

494
02:00:01,510 --> 02:00:06,310
of talk about whatever. But the reason why I didn't play it for a while is because

495
02:00:07,350 --> 02:00:13,270
it was sort of a crutch for a while right. We would just play it all the time. There was

496
02:00:13,270 --> 02:00:18,149
like three or four cases in a row within a week or two weeks where it was like uh GeoGuessr.

497
02:00:19,539 --> 02:00:24,199
So I kind of wanted to take a break from it. I played it a lot. It was like oh we've been

498
02:00:24,199 --> 02:00:29,399
playing this game for like three four hours. This game kind of sucks but we might as well

499
02:00:29,399 --> 02:00:35,319
play PictoPix right. That's become what PictoPix is. It's because of Comcast. Yeah that's true

500
02:00:35,319 --> 02:00:41,050
but it was like a Comcast crutch. So I don't really need the Comcast crutch anymore. Although

501
02:00:41,050 --> 02:00:50,300
Cox's as we've been aware hasn't been nearly as bad as what Comcast used to do but still

502
02:00:50,300 --> 02:00:59,800
there's still our problem sometimes with Cox. Switch it out with Google Feud once in a while.

503
02:01:01,560 --> 02:01:09,449
Yeah I really do like just playing browser games and hanging out. I want to do this more

504
02:01:09,449 --> 02:01:17,939
often. We've talked about it already but I want to add more kind of hang out and doing

505
02:01:17,939 --> 02:01:27,140
browser stuff. There's a lot more opportunity I think to interact and have conversations and

506
02:01:27,800 --> 02:01:36,199
come up with scenarios and talk to each other and stuff. So I want to do more of this type

507
02:01:36,199 --> 02:01:48,060
of thing not less. But thank you Smelly Boy. I do enjoy Neo uh it's almost I just said

508
02:01:49,020 --> 02:02:05,590
NeoGuessr. NeoGuessr. Like for The Matrix. I don't know why. Weird. Neopets.

509
02:02:09,699 --> 02:02:25,930
Neo. Imagine a GeoGuessr map in The Matrix. I don't know. Stream The Matrix

510
02:02:25,930 --> 02:02:30,630
video game. It doesn't even work anymore. Isn't The Matrix online completely off? Is

511
02:02:30,630 --> 02:02:39,319
the other one even worth playing? And then we had too many subs to even there was so

512
02:02:39,319 --> 02:02:46,489
many community subs. Thank you everybody that decided to give a community sub because there

513
02:02:46,489 --> 02:02:54,470
was a shitload of them like an hour ago. You guys are too kind. Thank you. Also Smelly

514
02:02:54,470 --> 02:02:59,670
Boy thanks to the 250. Most of Russia in the East is Siberia. Nobody lives there. The

515
02:02:59,670 --> 02:03:04,439
vast majority of the population is always in the West of Russia. I'll remember that for

516
02:03:04,439 --> 02:03:12,060
next time. Flug Boy thanks to the 250. Hey Jerm I hope you're doing well. Just got into

517
02:03:12,060 --> 02:03:18,649
a relationship with a very close friend of mine uh two years and been happier than ever.

518
02:03:19,210 --> 02:03:23,449
But yeah pretty fun stuff. Hope you and Kim are doing great my guy. I always love her

519
02:03:23,449 --> 02:03:32,010
posts of you and her on Twitter. Yeah I'm well first of all I'm glad you're uh doing

520
02:03:32,010 --> 02:03:48,220
well in a relationship. Yeah Kim and I are doing great. She's she's my girl you know.

521
02:03:48,220 --> 02:04:02,039
She's my girl. But thank you for the 250. Glad you've uh glad you're happy.

522
02:04:05,979 --> 02:04:16,069
And here are the ton of community subs. So many of them. Five dollars from Moson.

523
02:04:16,789 --> 02:04:21,109
I was in Boston for packs. Spent most of my time exploring Boston. An amazing city

524
02:04:21,670 --> 02:04:29,289
but the Green Line can eat my ass. Yes I agree. The Green Line is horrible. The Green

525
02:04:29,289 --> 02:04:39,829
Line is always packed. It's always hard to navigate. That is a true state. I'm glad you

526
02:04:39,829 --> 02:04:45,350
had fun. Boston is a really really nice city. Thank you the five dollars. Hope you enjoyed

527
02:04:45,350 --> 02:04:49,989
packs. Kind of sad that I wasn't able to be there. That would be the first time in

528
02:04:50,890 --> 02:04:55,880
its inception. I've been to every single packs East since they started the first time.

529
02:05:00,470 --> 02:05:06,149
Didn't get to make it this year. But thank you Freudian Weapon for the five dollars.

530
02:05:09,079 --> 02:05:14,539
250 here twice in a row. You're as young as you feel. Dressed the way you like. Age

531
02:05:14,539 --> 02:05:22,779
doesn't have a dress code. Yeah I know I was just kidding around. I was just kidding around.

532
02:05:22,779 --> 02:05:27,510
And then they also say if you were to hang up the streaming hat tomorrow I would respect

533
02:05:27,510 --> 02:05:32,659
your decision and wish you well on your future endeavors. Jeremy Hart. Thank you.

534
02:05:37,050 --> 02:05:43,960
Yeah I never it's never gonna be a scenario where I just disappear. It would be something

535
02:05:43,960 --> 02:05:49,640
that you guys would know what's happening. I'd say you know that's it. I had a lot of fun.

536
02:05:49,640 --> 02:05:53,829
I want to move on to other things. But I don't think I would be able to stay away.

537
02:05:55,050 --> 02:05:58,170
I think I would probably still okay let's say if I stopped streaming completely right.

538
02:05:58,729 --> 02:06:05,770
Whenever that was whenever that will be. Or stop making streams or videos or your content

539
02:06:05,770 --> 02:06:11,210
online content media or whatever you want to call it. I would still probably poke my head

540
02:06:11,210 --> 02:06:17,000
around you know once a week or once every few weeks or something. Turn a stream on just hang

541
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:23,960
out do something fun. I really don't think I would ever be gone forever completely from the

542
02:06:23,960 --> 02:06:35,609
platform. You know I mean it would just be I don't think I would be able to do that.

543
02:06:45,899 --> 02:06:55,140
But that's not in the cards in any sort of immediate sense. I have absolutely no plans to

544
02:06:55,140 --> 02:07:02,699
stop. But I do need to acknowledge the fact that if I ever don't want to do it anymore

545
02:07:02,699 --> 02:07:08,630
and I don't you know not having fun anymore. I've done things that I want to do. I think

546
02:07:08,630 --> 02:07:15,130
I would probably want to eventually you know do something else. I don't know. I don't have a

547
02:07:15,130 --> 02:07:20,460
number for that. I don't have a time frame for that. But I think I need to be honest with

548
02:07:20,460 --> 02:07:29,859
everybody. Sure it's easy to be like streams forever. This is it's until I'm 80. But I don't

549
02:07:29,859 --> 02:07:44,100
know that that's I don't know if that's gonna happen. I'm currently enjoying it.

550
02:07:44,970 --> 02:07:52,739
Something I love to do. I love being on stream. I love being part of the community. I love

551
02:07:52,739 --> 02:07:56,899
seeing all this shit. I love doing all these things. So I don't have it's not gonna stop

552
02:07:56,899 --> 02:08:06,859
anytime soon. There you go. Quarter dime thanks to the five dollars. Just disappear for five years

553
02:08:06,859 --> 02:08:17,739
and then come back with a turban or and telling us how you found faith. Or like just going like

554
02:08:17,739 --> 02:08:35,779
a religious journey and come back. I don't think I would do that. Disappear for five years and

555
02:08:35,779 --> 02:08:43,640
come back as like a preacher or something. Would you be interested in becoming the next joker if

556
02:08:43,640 --> 02:08:56,260
DC contacted you? No. Nope. Now the Riddler. You got an opportunity.

557
02:08:59,819 --> 02:09:12,619
Somebody already said it. I didn't even need to do it. How much would you do it for? 40 bucks.

558
02:09:14,420 --> 02:09:26,180
But I want five percent of all royalties from the movie. No no I want I want 0.2 percent of

559
02:09:26,180 --> 02:09:37,399
all revenue the movie makes. I'll do it for 40 dollars. It's gonna flop. No it's gonna have

560
02:09:37,399 --> 02:09:45,659
at least like a 74 percent on Rotten Tomatoes. I'll make sure of that. Yeah well the movie really

561
02:09:45,659 --> 02:09:51,420
sucked. Terrible writing. Awful awful direction. The cinematography. The story was all over the

562
02:09:51,420 --> 02:10:00,300
place but you just couldn't take your eyes off Jeremy Elbertson's performance. And then

563
02:10:00,300 --> 02:10:02,859
they go you know on Rotten Tomatoes you have the thing with a guy the person would write

564
02:10:02,859 --> 02:10:08,699
the thing. Even the skill of Jeremy Elbertson cannot hold this mess together. I don't care if

565
02:10:08,699 --> 02:10:22,229
it gets a 30 percent on Rotten Tomatoes. I'll carry it. The Great Lord Walden. 50 dollars right

566
02:10:22,229 --> 02:10:32,579
now. 5,000 bits from The Great Lord Walden. Thank you so much for the 5,000 bits. It's my

567
02:10:32,579 --> 02:10:39,770
birthday today. I'm 33. Feeling Jerma old tonight. Thanks for everything you do. I'm 33 too.

568
02:10:41,609 --> 02:10:47,850
34 this year. Happy birthday Great Lord Walden. Thank you for the 50 dollars.

569
02:10:48,489 --> 02:10:53,880
You're not you don't you never you never feel you're never too old.

570
02:10:54,439 --> 02:11:11,319
No you don't feel old. We're young. 33 is the new 20. 40 is the new 30. I know it is. I'm

571
02:11:11,319 --> 02:11:20,649
telling you it is. 50 will always be 50. 50 is not the new 50 or the old. 50 is just 50 and

572
02:11:20,649 --> 02:11:26,649
then from that point forward 50 is just the 50. You're gone. You're out. 55 you can retire.

573
02:11:28,409 --> 02:11:49,270
40 is the new 30. 50 still 50. I'm not gonna feel old until I'm 49 and one day till my birthday.

574
02:11:49,270 --> 02:12:04,409
You're allowed to feel old when you're 50. Jerma can run for president in two months. No I

575
02:12:04,409 --> 02:12:17,029
can't. It's 35. I cannot run for president yet. It's gonna have to be Jerma 2021.

576
02:12:17,670 --> 02:12:32,649
I mean yeah I can. It's 34. It would have to be Jerma 2024. He's thought about it.

577
02:12:32,649 --> 02:12:45,369
No it's just something that you are told in middle school. I want to ask if you're interested

578
02:12:45,369 --> 02:12:50,069
in any game recommendations. If you have recommendations throw them in the recommendation

579
02:12:50,069 --> 02:12:56,699
channel on the discord. I check it all the time. Everyone's thought about it. Yeah everybody's

580
02:12:56,699 --> 02:13:07,739
thought about it. Five more community subs on top of everything. Thank you so much for the

581
02:13:07,739 --> 02:13:24,420
five community subs. That was from BlackDymo. Thank you BlackDymo. Didn't get one. Oh what's

582
02:13:24,420 --> 02:13:36,659
the discord? Here it is. It is a public discord. There is a sub channel but it's open to the public.

583
02:13:36,659 --> 02:13:45,779
It's a great community there. But thank you great Lord Walden for the 50 dollars and happy

584
02:13:45,779 --> 02:13:55,859
birthday again. Also a little bit further back here we had a quarter dime thanks to the five

585
02:13:55,859 --> 02:14:04,869
bucks. I think didn't get you before. We read your message but I don't think I even said your

586
02:14:04,869 --> 02:14:11,689
name. But that was quarter dime for five dollars. Thank you. Juno Upseto thanks for the

587
02:14:11,689 --> 02:14:18,119
250. The leaf in front of the camera is actually GeoGuessr hard mode. It did make it pretty hard.

588
02:14:23,050 --> 02:14:29,930
Great Lord Walden's got 82 gifted subs. Some of you guys you wonder how my sub count is so high.

589
02:14:31,609 --> 02:14:38,390
There are at least a few dozen of you guys that have 50 to 100 each gifted subs.

590
02:14:41,079 --> 02:14:59,989
That's it's just bonkers. A simple way I can share the love. Well I really appreciate that.

591
02:15:00,710 --> 02:15:10,539
Thank you. Clueless Sniper thanks for the 250. No message just 250. Thank you Clueless Sniper.

592
02:15:11,560 --> 02:15:18,340
Novi333 thanks for the three dollars and 33 cents. No message just 333. Novi coming in.

593
02:15:20,869 --> 02:15:24,810
Freudian thanks for the 250. Pretty sure I spammed bit messages tonight.

594
02:15:24,810 --> 02:15:31,619
Whoops a bad habit of mine I suppose. Anyhow happy Saturday. No you've got like three or four

595
02:15:31,619 --> 02:15:42,890
here. Spam? What are you talking about? Thank you for the 250. Have a happy Saturday.

596
02:15:47,739 --> 02:15:56,140
And then we also had Jerma lied about Minecraft VR with five more community subs bringing them

597
02:15:56,140 --> 02:16:04,920
to 220 gifted subs. Yes I guess that you heard that correct. 220 gifted subs.

598
02:16:12,859 --> 02:16:26,119
That's so many. Thank you Jerma lied about Minecraft VR for your monster sub gifting.

599
02:16:32,969 --> 02:16:37,909
Thank you. Crimbalt thanks for the 250. Hello Sire I was just wondering if you saw

600
02:16:37,909 --> 02:16:41,190
the trailer for the sequel to Hollow Knight. I don't know if you ever get to finish the

601
02:16:41,190 --> 02:16:44,870
first one. Would be interested in this one but regardless I love all your streams.

602
02:16:45,750 --> 02:16:57,909
I have seen the second game. I will probably play it. There's a Hollow Knight sequel.

603
02:16:58,549 --> 02:17:08,360
At least there is a Hollow Knight sequel. Let's run the credits. That's it for the bits

604
02:17:08,360 --> 02:17:19,260
for the most part. Thank you everybody. Here come the names. Thanks for supporting the stream.

605
02:17:22,889 --> 02:17:38,059
All of you. Read them. Go go go. Ding. Two state taco. Poopy ass.

606
02:17:41,750 --> 02:17:47,340
I used to, I used to read these. Remember when I used to really give it a really solid

607
02:17:47,340 --> 02:18:01,100
attempt and it was so much slower. Sometimes it would be like this. But it's like this

608
02:18:01,100 --> 02:18:18,409
almost every time now. You guys understand how fucking ridiculous that is? Well Jerma lied about

609
02:18:18,409 --> 02:18:23,610
Gwere. Jerma lied about like Gwere? Like the song thing? What is with these all these

610
02:18:23,610 --> 02:18:34,979
Jerma lied about this. Jerma lied about that. Jerma lied about Gwere. What the fuck.

611
02:18:39,180 --> 02:18:44,219
Somebody asked a quarter dime asked hey Jerma if I were to go watch an old stream of yours

612
02:18:44,219 --> 02:18:58,020
any old stream which would you choose and why um probably sorcery sorcery is the first

613
02:18:59,079 --> 02:19:04,920
real stream attempt that I really did on a schedule or doing twitch instead of youtube

614
02:19:08,540 --> 02:19:14,459
and I would probably say that those a lot of stream jokes and a lot of classic references

615
02:19:16,020 --> 02:19:24,409
even to stuff that's still in the chat now stuff like sus um the green screen stream

616
02:19:24,409 --> 02:19:30,819
was so much fun there's been so many there's been too many all of them except for skate three

617
02:19:30,819 --> 02:19:35,860
don't watch that one don't watch the karazhan stream don't watch the mario tennis stream don't

618
02:19:35,860 --> 02:19:53,000
watch um spell a few others don't watch the neo stream rick and morty that was fine the

619
02:19:53,000 --> 02:20:01,659
handheld game no watch the handheld game stream that's one of my favorites rick and morty was

620
02:20:01,659 --> 02:20:06,780
awful yeah but was that my fault or was that the game's fault maybe it was a little

621
02:20:06,780 --> 02:20:15,979
bit but i was really tired i was so tired when we got to rick and morty both i mean it wasn't

622
02:20:15,979 --> 02:20:21,180
my i was so tired i just couldn't even do anything and i gave up even 10 of the way

623
02:20:21,180 --> 02:20:31,750
through i just couldn't do it it was chat's fault but that wasn't okay it was minecraft

624
02:20:31,750 --> 02:20:38,389
vr and then rick and morty so that stream was good i like that was a lot of fun but

625
02:20:38,389 --> 02:20:42,459
the rick and morty portion of that stream that's not the whole i'm talking about a
