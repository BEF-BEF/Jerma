1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:12,890
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with some more Hitman Absolution.

2
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:18,890
This is gonna be mission three called Terminus, where I have to gain access to a hotel room.

3
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:22,890
And well, basically the hotel. And hopefully I don't get hit by like a car.

4
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:26,190
Any cars driving down this road? No, there's a train.

5
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:32,189
But I gotta gain access to this hotel. I gotta find an arms dealer by the name of Blake.

6
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:36,560
Not sure what the deal is here, but I'm just gonna go in the front door.

7
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:38,950
Hey buddy!

8
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:43,950
Hmm, closed.

9
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:48,950
How you doing?

10
00:00:54,950 --> 00:01:00,950
So I cannot go up there. Cannot go upstairs or else those guys are gonna shoot me.

11
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:05,769
So I'm gonna go this way. What is like Henry Winkle doing over here?

12
00:01:05,769 --> 00:01:10,799
Well, I can't go in there. Staff only, okay? Staff only, I get you.

13
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:15,920
Is this guy part of the staff? Can I like break this guy's neck and take his outfit?

14
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,480
Probably not. Let's see.

15
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:25,859
Hmm, to get upstairs, I'm probably gonna need to do some interesting things here.

16
00:01:25,859 --> 00:01:28,859
This is the restroom. This guy's coming in here actually.

17
00:01:28,859 --> 00:01:32,250
Yeah, this guy's coming in the bathroom right now.

18
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:36,500
Oh my god, plunger, plunger. Can I like plunge this guy?

19
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:42,340
Oh god. Oh, I can like choke him out with the plunger.

20
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:46,659
Sick. No one's coming in here, right?

21
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:51,519
Get in the toilet!

22
00:01:54,519 --> 00:01:56,079
Just shut the hell up!

23
00:01:58,079 --> 00:01:59,450
You didn't see anything.

24
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:04,290
Oh my god, like this guy's gonna take like a dump.

25
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:06,290
Oh no, oh no.

26
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:10,289
Alright, don't worry. Don't worry, I'm not gonna do anything.

27
00:02:11,289 --> 00:02:13,490
Knock him out.

28
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:21,430
Well, so things have gone very, very smoothly in the first like five seconds.

29
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:23,430
I have to dump all these bodies in the toilet.

30
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:27,400
Can I even hide these guys in here?

31
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:31,219
This is gonna be three random dudes in the bathroom. Oh no.

32
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:37,699
Can I block the bathroom off? Oh great, okay, that's like a dumpster.

33
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:39,699
Alright, I need to put on that guy's bowling shirt.

34
00:02:39,699 --> 00:02:41,009
Whatever the hell he's wearing.

35
00:02:41,009 --> 00:02:46,870
Hopefully nobody else comes in the bathroom.

36
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:50,870
Dude, I clubbed that guy in his face with a dirty plunger.

37
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:54,900
Maybe I can put that guy in the other room.

38
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:58,900
Wow, this is, I almost already have minus 5,000 freaking points.

39
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:04,689
It's alright. No more bodies can fit in here.

40
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:08,780
Maybe I can stuff this guy.

41
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:10,090
Can I open this door?

42
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:15,650
I'm gonna have to very, very cautiously drag this guy back towards the toilet.

43
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:18,530
Oh, I'm like breaking his leg. That was so horrible.

44
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:20,530
Look at this, like I'm wrenching him.

45
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:24,050
I honestly can't do anything with this guy.

46
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:25,050
Hold on a second.

47
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:28,300
I'm gonna look out here.

48
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:32,370
Is there like a dumpster right here I can dump this guy in?

49
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:35,659
Is anyone gonna see it?

50
00:03:35,659 --> 00:03:37,659
If anyone goes in that bathroom, damn it.

51
00:03:37,659 --> 00:03:39,280
Oh, whatever.

52
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,280
Well, people are getting curious.

53
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,800
I can't even go in the staff room.

54
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,550
What was the point of all that?

55
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:47,550
I can't even like walk over here.

56
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:51,840
Oh, staff only.

57
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,599
Whoa, hey, hello fellas.

58
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:56,599
Are they gonna see me?

59
00:03:56,599 --> 00:03:57,599
They're gonna see me if I go over here.

60
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:03,060
We're good.

61
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:04,060
We're good so far.

62
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:11,129
Except for the fact that I minus 5,000 points.

63
00:04:11,129 --> 00:04:12,129
If I open this, who's behind here?

64
00:04:12,129 --> 00:04:14,750
There's a guy standing right here.

65
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,180
Hold on.

66
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:18,180
Can I like break a bottle or something?

67
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:19,810
Do I have a bottle?

68
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:20,810
I got a plunger.

69
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:22,810
Can I like throw the plunger at the door and like freak him out?

70
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:26,139
All right, good, good, good.

71
00:04:26,139 --> 00:04:29,410
Perfect.

72
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:31,410
All right, now maybe somebody will come out here and I can distract them.

73
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:34,670
Oh, this guy's got like a worker's hat on.

74
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:36,939
Wait, no, he doesn't.

75
00:04:36,939 --> 00:04:40,519
Is that one of like the crew?

76
00:04:43,699 --> 00:04:44,699
Is anybody out there?

77
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:47,779
No, it's just not me.

78
00:04:47,779 --> 00:04:52,339
He's in the damn doorway.

79
00:04:52,339 --> 00:04:54,339
I can't do anything about this.

80
00:04:54,339 --> 00:04:58,209
All right, he's walking the other way.

81
00:04:58,209 --> 00:04:59,209
Good.

82
00:04:59,209 --> 00:05:03,439
Good.

83
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:04,439
Oh, whoa.

84
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:05,439
Oh my God, I'm stuck.

85
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:10,709
I go up these stairs.

86
00:05:10,709 --> 00:05:11,709
That's a real question.

87
00:05:11,709 --> 00:05:15,740
I don't want to get spotted.

88
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:18,370
There's a guy with a ponytail.

89
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:21,019
What's this disguise?

90
00:05:21,019 --> 00:05:23,769
Disguise is a hope goon.

91
00:05:23,769 --> 00:05:25,769
But I already am disguised as one of those goons, aren't I?

92
00:05:25,769 --> 00:05:28,899
Oh, except I got like a cowboy hat on now.

93
00:05:28,899 --> 00:05:30,899
Hey, what's going on, partner?

94
00:05:30,899 --> 00:05:34,699
Howdy, partner.

95
00:05:34,699 --> 00:05:37,389
So now I should be able to go upstairs now, shouldn't I?

96
00:05:37,389 --> 00:05:39,819
Because I'm one of these dudes.

97
00:05:39,819 --> 00:05:41,829
Let's see.

98
00:05:41,829 --> 00:05:42,829
Let's just find out if I can.

99
00:05:47,209 --> 00:05:48,209
I hate spiders, dude.

100
00:05:48,209 --> 00:05:50,209
I don't know what you're talking about.

101
00:05:50,209 --> 00:05:54,149
Oh, well, that's just lovely.

102
00:05:54,149 --> 00:05:56,160
That guy's spotting me.

103
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,550
All right, where the hell am I going now?

104
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:00,550
I got to go like upstairs, don't I?

105
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:01,550
I got to go over this way.

106
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:05,889
Oh, let's wrap around here.

107
00:06:05,889 --> 00:06:09,339
And just for fun, let's like punch this guy in his face.

108
00:06:09,339 --> 00:06:10,339
Hold on.

109
00:06:10,339 --> 00:06:14,379
Can I go in here?

110
00:06:14,379 --> 00:06:17,620
The elevator is likely to have an additional basement entry point.

111
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:18,620
All right, fine.

112
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:20,379
Let's go down here.

113
00:06:20,379 --> 00:06:23,639
Let's go down the basement.

114
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:24,639
Let's be a basement dweller.

115
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:25,639
Is it an apatage?

116
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:34,050
No.

117
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:36,500
Why is this?

118
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,500
Why am I?

119
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,500
Oh, that's to dump bodies.

120
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,500
Oh, boy.

121
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,000
Oh, boy.

122
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Oh, boy.

123
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,199
Oh, boy.

124
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:45,199
Hey, fellas.

125
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:47,529
Hey, fellas, how are you?

126
00:06:47,529 --> 00:06:48,529
Is that a worker?

127
00:06:48,529 --> 00:06:49,529
Yeah, this is a hotel worker.

128
00:06:49,529 --> 00:06:50,529
I should probably take his disguise.

129
00:06:50,529 --> 00:06:54,110
I don't want a disguise staring at me.

130
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:57,379
Come here.

131
00:06:57,379 --> 00:06:58,620
Come here, you son of a...

132
00:06:58,620 --> 00:06:59,620
I'm not going to hurt.

133
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:00,620
I'm just going to give you...

134
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,250
I'm putting you to sleep.

135
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:03,250
Hold.

136
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:04,250
Don't worry.

137
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:06,579
You'll wake up tomorrow morning and you won't remember that damn thing.

138
00:07:06,579 --> 00:07:08,009
Now, give me that.

139
00:07:08,009 --> 00:07:13,220
Now, let me dump your ass.

140
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:14,220
What are these guys looking for?

141
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:16,699
Isn't it pretty bright down here?

142
00:07:16,699 --> 00:07:17,699
Why would they need a flashlight?

143
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:19,449
Oh, shit.

144
00:07:19,449 --> 00:07:20,449
Oh, no.

145
00:07:20,449 --> 00:07:21,449
Hey, how you doing?

146
00:07:21,449 --> 00:07:25,250
Oh, damn it.

147
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:26,250
Oh, damn it.

148
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:29,540
Oh, why did I?

149
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:37,449
I should have just walked up the damn stairs.

150
00:07:40,529 --> 00:07:41,529
They don't know I'm here, though.

151
00:07:41,529 --> 00:07:45,740
They just know that somebody is karate chopping their workers in the face.

152
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:51,060
Damn it.

153
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:53,430
Now, he's going to walk up the stairs.

154
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:54,430
Get me out of here.

155
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:56,740
Oh, hello there, sir.

156
00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:00,019
See you.

157
00:08:00,019 --> 00:08:01,019
All right.

158
00:08:01,019 --> 00:08:02,019
I'm going back to the front door.

159
00:08:02,019 --> 00:08:05,569
I'm going out this way.

160
00:08:05,569 --> 00:08:10,240
I got the stupid terminus gear on.

161
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,240
I'm going to go this way, around the corner.

162
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,740
Oh, I just picked up more ammo for that snub nose.

163
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:23,680
I haven't met him before.

164
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,680
There's only two kinds of people in this world.

165
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,620
This lady's nuts.

166
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:28,620
See you later, lady.

167
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:33,039
Okay.

168
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:35,750
Let's go up the stairs.

169
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:36,750
Oh, that was close.

170
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,379
Hello.

171
00:08:38,379 --> 00:08:39,379
Trespassing.

172
00:08:39,379 --> 00:08:40,379
What?

173
00:08:40,379 --> 00:08:41,940
I'm a worker.

174
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:45,389
I'm a wor- I work here.

175
00:08:45,389 --> 00:08:48,389
Hey, I work at this restaurant, hotel, bar casino.

176
00:08:48,389 --> 00:08:52,100
You can't tell me where to go.

177
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:56,389
I can still hear this lady.

178
00:08:56,389 --> 00:09:00,740
This lady's annoying.

179
00:09:06,049 --> 00:09:07,799
Oh, my God.

180
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:12,730
I couldn't take her talking anymore.

181
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:14,730
She was just talking.

182
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:16,730
She had an ironer in her face.

183
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:21,440
Oh, am I about to dump this poor lady off the window?

184
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,980
All right.

185
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:26,980
Well, see you later, grandma.

186
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:27,980
Ah.

187
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:28,980
All right.

188
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:32,950
Let me just tell you guys right now.

189
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:38,950
If I took an iron in my mouth, I would probably instantly, instantly kill me.

190
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:41,409
Hey, don't worry.

191
00:09:41,409 --> 00:09:45,350
I'm just doing my work here as a worker.

192
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:46,350
Can I do that?

193
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:47,350
Look at it.

194
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:48,779
It says I can hide here.

195
00:09:48,779 --> 00:09:49,779
Yeah, I can do it.

196
00:09:49,779 --> 00:09:52,559
See?

197
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:54,559
Hey, just working my, working my job here.

198
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:55,559
Don't worry about a thing.

199
00:09:55,559 --> 00:09:57,559
Just everybody stay calm.

200
00:09:57,559 --> 00:09:58,559
Stay collected.

201
00:09:58,559 --> 00:10:00,059
All right.

202
00:10:00,059 --> 00:10:02,549
Now, let me up the goddamn stairs.

203
00:10:02,549 --> 00:10:04,240
Ugh.

204
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,379
Maybe I got to be one of those workers.

205
00:10:07,379 --> 00:10:09,379
All right.

206
00:10:09,379 --> 00:10:10,379
Note to self.

207
00:10:10,379 --> 00:10:13,690
Go smash a worker's face in with an iron and then take his clothes.

208
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:14,690
Let's try this again.

209
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:16,820
I'm going this way.

210
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:21,009
Right through here.

211
00:10:21,009 --> 00:10:23,889
You guys don't see nothing.

212
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:27,279
Looking for one of those guys with a hard hat.

213
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:29,100
God, I'm so stupid.

214
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:31,100
I can't, like, do this mission.

215
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:33,169
All right.

216
00:10:33,169 --> 00:10:34,169
Is this one working?

217
00:10:34,169 --> 00:10:36,169
But this guy doesn't have a hard hat, so apparently I won't be allowed upstairs.

218
00:10:37,169 --> 00:10:41,070
That guy is a worker, though.

219
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:45,019
He's got the worker like clothes on.

220
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:46,019
He's working on the elevator.

221
00:10:46,019 --> 00:10:49,500
All right.

222
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:53,179
You know what?

223
00:10:53,179 --> 00:10:54,179
Just get out of my face.

224
00:10:54,179 --> 00:10:57,120
Oh, right in front of him, too.

225
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,809
Don't.

226
00:10:58,809 --> 00:10:59,809
That guy's got this.

227
00:10:59,809 --> 00:11:00,809
Oh, he's.

228
00:11:00,809 --> 00:11:01,809
Oh, great job.

229
00:11:01,809 --> 00:11:02,809
No, no, no.

230
00:11:02,809 --> 00:11:03,809
You won't get away.

231
00:11:03,809 --> 00:11:04,809
You won't.

232
00:11:04,809 --> 00:11:05,809
Just calm down.

233
00:11:05,809 --> 00:11:06,809
Everybody calm down.

234
00:11:06,809 --> 00:11:08,940
Everybody just calm down for a second.

235
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:10,629
Great.

236
00:11:10,629 --> 00:11:11,629
Fantastic.

237
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:12,629
Can I jump down here?

238
00:11:12,629 --> 00:11:13,629
Jump down like frigging Batman.

239
00:11:13,629 --> 00:11:14,629
Come on, man.

240
00:11:14,629 --> 00:11:16,509
Oh, my God.

241
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:17,509
They're unloading.

242
00:11:17,509 --> 00:11:18,509
They're unloading.

243
00:11:18,509 --> 00:11:19,509
Get me out of here.

244
00:11:19,509 --> 00:11:27,789
Get me the hell out of here.

245
00:11:27,789 --> 00:11:30,950
No.

246
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:31,950
All right, guys.

247
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:32,950
It's time.

248
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:33,950
I tried the.

249
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:35,710
I tried the the nice way.

250
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:37,950
It's time to start unloading on people.

251
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:42,899
Get me out of here.

252
00:11:42,899 --> 00:11:45,419
I didn't want to happen to have it come to this.

253
00:11:45,419 --> 00:11:46,419
Wow.

254
00:11:46,419 --> 00:11:47,419
That was a cool move.

255
00:11:47,419 --> 00:11:48,419
All right.

256
00:11:48,419 --> 00:11:50,620
I made it.

257
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:51,620
What?

258
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:52,620
I can't proceed without with enemies on high alert.

259
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,120
Oh, boy.

260
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,120
I'm dead.

261
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,120
I'm dead.

262
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,620
I'm dead.

263
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:58,620
I'm dead.

264
00:11:58,620 --> 00:11:59,620
I'm dead.

265
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:01,559
Oh, crap.

266
00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:02,559
No.

267
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,080
I'm gonna die right here.

268
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,080
I'm gonna die right here.

269
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,960
Give me the screwdriver.

270
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:07,960
Backup has arrived.

271
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,639
Oh, I'm in so much trouble.

272
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:11,960
I'm in so much trouble.

273
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:12,960
I'm bleeding.

274
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:15,029
I'm dying.

275
00:12:15,029 --> 00:12:17,830
The question is, can I hide somewhere?

276
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:18,830
Can I hide somewhere?

277
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:20,330
Where are these guys?

278
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:21,330
One guy over there.

279
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:22,330
One guy coming around the corner right now.

280
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:25,039
All right.

281
00:12:25,039 --> 00:12:26,539
What's another one?

282
00:12:26,539 --> 00:12:27,539
Got to run.

283
00:12:27,539 --> 00:12:28,539
Got to run.

284
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:30,610
Got to run.

285
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:31,610
Get up and run.

286
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:33,230
Get up and run.

287
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:34,230
You stupid idiot.

288
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:35,230
Anybody in here?

289
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:36,230
Come on.

290
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:37,230
I need to like I need like a I need like a basket or something to hide in.

291
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:38,230
It's got to be like a stupid.

292
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:39,230
Like I'm so.

293
00:12:39,669 --> 00:12:40,669
Oh, I'm so nervous right now.

294
00:12:40,669 --> 00:12:43,509
No.

295
00:12:43,509 --> 00:12:44,509
Come on.

296
00:12:44,509 --> 00:12:46,710
I've got to hide in.

297
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:47,710
It's all right.

298
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:48,710
I'm good right here.

299
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:50,529
I'm okay.

300
00:12:50,529 --> 00:12:51,529
They're still looking for me.

301
00:12:51,529 --> 00:12:52,529
Oh, what?

302
00:12:52,529 --> 00:12:54,730
I can't believe.

303
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:55,730
How did I gain points?

304
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:56,899
Why?

305
00:12:56,899 --> 00:12:59,809
Why?

306
00:12:59,809 --> 00:13:00,809
I'm at negative 4,700.

307
00:13:00,809 --> 00:13:01,809
I don't know how I got points for doing what I just did.

308
00:13:01,809 --> 00:13:05,990
All right.

309
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:07,789
Sooner or later, they're gonna have to give up their search.

310
00:13:07,789 --> 00:13:10,110
I can go back to running up the stairs.

311
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:15,450
What a way to do the mission.

312
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:19,769
It only took to mission three for Jerma to completely be an absolute freak show and just

313
00:13:19,769 --> 00:13:21,450
unload on everybody he sees.

314
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:26,879
This guy's coming this way.

315
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:31,860
Man, I need to.

316
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:33,860
Can I make my way back up to the stairs now?

317
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:37,559
I mean, I got one prick right here.

318
00:13:37,559 --> 00:13:39,399
He's got a shotgun too.

319
00:13:39,399 --> 00:13:41,409
Fabulous.

320
00:13:41,409 --> 00:13:50,990
Listen, bro, you are gonna I'm gonna Batman the hell out of you.

321
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:51,990
Cautious.

322
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:52,990
All right.

323
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:53,990
We got down to cautious.

324
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:54,990
Got down to cautious.

325
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:55,990
They're looking for me.

326
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:57,620
They're looking for a guy that looks like this.

327
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:58,620
So I need to get behind this guy.

328
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:00,710
I got to take this guy's disguise.

329
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:01,710
Which way is he facing?

330
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:03,980
He's facing that way.

331
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:05,860
Come here.

332
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:06,860
Come on.

333
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:08,029
No, don't go outside.

334
00:14:08,029 --> 00:14:09,029
He's the only one, right?

335
00:14:09,789 --> 00:14:12,759
No, no.

336
00:14:12,759 --> 00:14:13,759
I didn't want to shoot him in the back.

337
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:16,679
I didn't want to shoot the guy in the goddamn back.

338
00:14:16,679 --> 00:14:18,820
Why did that happen?

339
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:19,820
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

340
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:22,460
Oh, let me be sneaky.

341
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:23,460
I shot that.

342
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:24,460
No, no.

343
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:25,460
Go back in.

344
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:26,460
Go back in.

345
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:28,090
No.

346
00:14:28,090 --> 00:14:29,970
Oh, no.

347
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:30,970
Oh, this is going so badly.

348
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:34,659
This is going so badly.

349
00:14:34,659 --> 00:14:38,460
This is going so badly, guys.

350
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:43,019
It's all because I shot the guy in the back and I was trying to choke him.

351
00:14:43,019 --> 00:14:44,019
Oh, man.

352
00:14:44,019 --> 00:14:45,860
What a complete catastrophe.

353
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:48,639
All right.

354
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:49,639
Come here.

355
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,620
Goddamn disguise.

356
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:54,419
And let me just walk up the freaking stairs.

357
00:14:54,419 --> 00:14:57,320
All right.

358
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,070
Nobody's around.

359
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:04,320
I killed like the whole hotel staff, apparently.

360
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,360
Dump this guy's body and go up the stairs.

361
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:11,909
I'm making this way more difficult and way more complicated than I have to be.

362
00:15:11,909 --> 00:15:14,879
Get in there.

363
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:16,000
Sorry for shooting you in the back.

364
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I didn't want to do that.

365
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I wanted to choke you.

366
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:26,320
Well, oh, good thing I got 135 points for hiding the body.

367
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:31,759
Don't mind me.

368
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:32,759
Call the elevator.

369
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:37,610
Hey, look at that.

370
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:40,830
Sweet.

371
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:46,259
That guy completed the mission.

372
00:15:46,259 --> 00:15:47,259
Can I get in?

373
00:15:47,259 --> 00:15:48,259
Oh, yeah.

374
00:15:48,259 --> 00:15:49,700
I think this is it.

375
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,830
Hey, let's go.

376
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:56,789
So that is going to wrap it up here for this first part of the hotel mission.

377
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:58,750
So I'll see you guys all soon.

378
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:01,789
And stay tuned for the next part of the hotel, upper floors.

379
00:16:01,789 --> 00:16:03,309
And take care, everybody.
