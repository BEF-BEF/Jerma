00:00:01,459 --> 00:00:11,060
Hello, good afternoon. How have you been? I'm on a mystery stream today.

2
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:21,980
I don't know, can you hear my Xbox in the background? I can. This looks like a spaceship.

3
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:32,100
The mystery stream is Viva Pinata for the Xbox 360. Mystery stream!

4
00:00:34,939 --> 00:00:40,380
Only going to be live for a few hours today. I got a lot of stuff to do today into this weekend,

5
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:46,299
so I gotta get on it. But I did want to stream because I like streaming.

6
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:53,060
I had the demo disc. Well, let's see if the demo is as good as the real game.

7
00:00:53,859 --> 00:01:59,030
I'll just tweet this out. I'll be right back. Okay. Also, I'm gonna be really honest.

8
00:01:59,989 --> 00:02:06,980
I have no idea what this game is. I was gonna play it until I get bored. I've never played it.

9
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:14,520
I know this is one of the most beloved new, rare franchises, right? I don't even know what it is.

10
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:23,460
Every commercial I ever saw was just pinata animals walking around and you feed them candy

11
00:02:24,659 --> 00:02:33,300
right up my alley. So I got them. I got them all. I have every... Don't ask me why I do these things,

12
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:43,909
but I own every Viva Pinata game. I don't know why. I just do. What if we get bored?

13
00:02:45,319 --> 00:02:59,129
Well, read a book. Why? Because when I was buying them, they were like $3 each. These were not more

14
00:02:59,129 --> 00:03:12,310
than like $2 to $4 each. It's not like I spent a lot of money on these games. But I got a few

15
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:22,659
hours, so I figured let's throw in Viva Pinata. Viva Pinata! Here it comes. Oh, no, no, no, no. I

16
00:03:22,659 --> 00:03:26,020
don't wanna get spoiled. Look, there's like little snakes and stuff. This is gonna be great.

17
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:37,800
Do you get to pick the animal? This game is my childhood. I know it's like... Look, we're on

18
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:43,800
childhood week. Chibi-Robo. Holy fuck, that was incredible. What an amazing game. That's my

19
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:50,280
childhood. Viva Pinata. This is my childhood, Jerma. Cooking Mama. That was my childhood,

20
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:59,509
Jerma. I played them all. I was very good at chopping. This is childhood week. Are we ready?

21
00:03:59,509 --> 00:04:06,460
I'm just gonna go. No Viva Pinata save game profile has been found. Do you want to create one?

22
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:20,339
Of course I do. Oh, no, no, no. I don't want him to see. Hello. Yes. Sign in successful. Welcome

23
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:26,420
to Viva Pinata. Warning. Viva Pinata uses an auto-save feature. And removing an Xbox 360

24
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:32,180
memory unit or powering down your 360 while that-ish displayed can result in loss of your data.

25
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:37,139
Additionally, removing an Xbox 360 memory unit at any time will return into the title screen.

26
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:45,560
All right. I thought that was a Wii mode. All right. Learn about online safeguards. Why would

27
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:56,410
I do that? I want to play a garden, right? That's all I can do. New garden. You make a garden?

28
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:05,740
Enter a name for your garden. It's gonna be secret. I want this to be a secret.

29
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:48,170
All right. Yeah. You guys are gonna laugh. It's good. It's good suggestions. I'm seeing

30
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:59,560
there. Yes. Put it on the hard drive. That was your joke. That wasn't mine. You guys have-

31
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:05,480
That was your joke. You guys all wrote that and I was taking your suggestions. So what-

32
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:10,470
Mine is to yourself. I'm just- I'm a man of the people. All right. Let's go in the garden.

33
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:23,509
Deeds. Stop showing my fucking name. I- You get to pick what animal you- I get to be-

34
00:06:23,509 --> 00:06:29,420
Set for Viva Piñata, an ever-changing world full of endless possibilities.

35
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:33,019
Really? Because this is a world where you get to call the shots.

36
00:06:33,019 --> 00:06:39,019
Yeah. The piñata creatures and plant life that inhabit this land are all determined by you.

37
00:06:39,019 --> 00:06:44,300
From the minute you dig your first hole and plant your first seed, go well on your way to

38
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:50,060
attracting your first piñata visitors. If they like what they see, these piñatas may-

39
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:58,300
Piñata frog? Oh my god. As your piñata collection grows, you can choose which to collect

40
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:04,300
and which to train. Life on Piñata Island is never all daisies and apertures. When illness

41
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:07,899
or danger threatens, you'll need to be the one who comes to the rescue.

42
00:07:07,899 --> 00:07:16,490
What? You can fight? YouTuber voice. He's a narrator.

43
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:32,100
This is called presenting. Of course, it's going to be like an E3 voice. It's a guy presenting a

44
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:45,899
video. Does this like- Do I have to clean all this up? Wow. More cleaning. I love it already.

45
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:58,620
That's all we do on this stream now. It's clean. All right. So I move around with the left stick.

46
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:05,000
Talk. To Leifos. Oh, hello. I was hoping someone would come and help.

47
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:09,079
I was hoping someone would come and help and tidy up this mess.

48
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:15,689
You must be the new owner. I'm Leifos and I'm here to help you.

49
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:22,060
All right. Tutorial. Is she a piñata? Everything's a piñata here, right?

50
00:08:22,939 --> 00:08:36,309
Why do I feel like this is a Kinect game that I don't have the Kinect on? What was that?

51
00:08:36,309 --> 00:08:41,429
I've given you the journal. When you finish talking to me, press X to open the menu.

52
00:08:41,429 --> 00:08:46,950
All right. Then I'll tell you what to try next. Cool. Oh, I can't wait for this kids game.

53
00:08:48,179 --> 00:08:58,330
All right. We're done. So now we have- Welcome to the menu. Close this alert with A and then

54
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:03,049
you can move the left stick and the leaf in the middle will point to the different things that

55
00:09:03,049 --> 00:09:11,080
you can do. Point the leaf at the journal, then select it with A. Oh, okay. I don't. I don't.

56
00:09:11,639 --> 00:09:23,159
This is the journal. It stores all the information that you discover when you are playing the game.

57
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:28,279
The journal is split up into different parts to make it easier to find what you need.

58
00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:33,480
It works just like the menu. There's not much to see yet. So have a quick look and let's get

59
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:40,700
back to the garden. Okay. Let's get back to the garden. All right. Good. Louder? Why would I make

60
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:51,990
it louder than this? Oh, garden area, encyclopedia, how to, player awards. I mean, we can- what's this?

61
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:57,269
Encyclopedia? This just shows characters, garden constructions. We don't need any of this info.

62
00:09:58,070 --> 00:10:04,149
I know what I'm doing. Point and laugh at funny creature that walks into screen. I already know.

63
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:31,620
Down there. Is that a mask or is that her face? Alerts explanation.

64
00:10:32,419 --> 00:10:36,659
Alerts will wait down here. This is pretty cool. This is a Zelda character. This is a cool

65
00:10:36,659 --> 00:10:42,899
Zelda character. The alert will open automatically. If you have more than one alert, you can choose

66
00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:48,340
which one to open by moving the cursor over alerts with the left stick. Okay. When you finish with

67
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:55,460
the alert bar, press up on the D pad to put the cursor back into the garden. Cool. Time for another

68
00:10:55,460 --> 00:11:08,299
present. It's something you can't manage without. An animal. An animal. A broken shovel.

69
00:11:08,299 --> 00:11:17,740
You can't- you can't afford a regular shovel? Grab your shovel from the menu and turn this mess

70
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:23,100
into your dream garden. This is not going to work. Why are there bite marks?

71
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:32,100
Why are there bite marks in the shovel? You have to start from the bottom, friend.

72
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:39,909
Well okay. Menu. There's the shovel. The buttons in the top right of the screen tell you what you

73
00:11:39,909 --> 00:11:46,629
can do with the shovel. I have three bits of advice. One, you can clear the hard soil more

74
00:11:46,629 --> 00:11:53,990
quickly if you hold down A. Two, the shovel is old but it won't break. And three, if you hit

75
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:59,370
pinatas, they can become ill. If you'd like more advice- Wait, don't hit any pinatas with a shovel?

76
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:09,289
So this is one, you can clear hard soil more quickly. Two, the shovel is old but it won't break.

77
00:12:09,289 --> 00:12:37,379
Three, don't hit animals. Okay, don't hit animals with shovel. Oh! Oh my god, it's perfect.

78
00:12:37,379 --> 00:12:52,889
Oh my god, it's a perfect game. Oh my god, it's a perfect game. Chocolate? What's that little thing?

79
00:12:52,889 --> 00:12:59,929
Worm? Worm.

80
00:12:59,929 --> 00:13:05,049
Well done. You attracted a worm. The worm has turned up because you have-

81
00:13:05,049 --> 00:13:17,110
Crush. I'm not gonna crush the worm. Worm first sighting. Well, where is he? All right, smash the

82
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:33,029
junk. Smash it. Money. Explanation. Do I need to- do I really need to explain what money is?

83
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:47,159
Where's the worm? Is this a mobile game? No. Sorry, this predates mobile games. This is what

84
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:55,500
mobile games wish they were. In fact, this is what mobile games exploit. All right, pick up the

85
00:13:55,500 --> 00:14:05,059
money. How do I get the money? Mobile games took this idea and removed the actual video game from

86
00:14:05,059 --> 00:14:14,409
it. Where are the pinatas? I don't know. You have a new worm visitor. Where is he?

87
00:14:14,889 --> 00:14:25,210
The new one needs. If there's a big enough patch of soil or grass, it will want to visit.

88
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:40,169
Oh, all right. Oh, I got grass? I have to attract pinatas. But where's my like pinata attraction

89
00:14:40,169 --> 00:14:55,419
spray? Then press X for the menu. Choose your new grass seed packet from there. Okay, let's- no spray.

90
00:14:56,740 --> 00:15:01,059
Well, I'm going to clear this whole thing first, right? I don't want to leave any trash. They're

91
00:15:01,059 --> 00:15:14,259
not going to like this. How big is my area? Okay, I got into the white line there. Did I

92
00:15:14,259 --> 00:15:26,120
just become a Viva pinata streamer? I may have. It depends. Watch out. Watch out. Watch out. Don't hit.

93
00:15:26,679 --> 00:15:39,080
No, get out of the way. Get out of the way. I don't want to hurt you. Whack pinata. Poke pinata.

94
00:15:39,799 --> 00:15:50,309
Is that health? Wait, why can I do this? Why can I golf swing?

95
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:59,399
I don't know. That's my first friend. Do you think I'm going to kill my first friend? What

96
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:04,440
are you guys crazy? I want to clear this. There's so much- look at all this trash.

97
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:27,110
Kill. Chat's the psycho now. Yeah, you guys calling me a psycho. All right. Yeah, this is easier.

98
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:39,740
Just hold it down. Clear it all. Hey, do I get to expand? I get to pay money and expand, right?

99
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:53,659
All right. How's that? That's not bad. I have to plant grass. You missed a spot, did I? Where? No,

100
00:16:53,659 --> 00:17:13,259
I didn't. No, I didn't. People- right there? Where? People coming in from stir? Hi, guys.

101
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:24,089
We're playing an intense game called Viva Pinata. There's a ton- there's a shitload of blood in this

102
00:17:24,089 --> 00:17:32,650
game. You're going to want to stick around. Yeah, in the settings, there was a gore setting and I

103
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:49,430
kept it on. All right. Am I wasting time or is this actually what I'm supposed to be doing?

104
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:53,509
Am I- I should just do this, right? Just get it over with? Am I going to have all grass? This is

105
00:17:53,509 --> 00:18:09,400
a problem. Am I doing this wrong? Because if- I don't just want the field of grass. Okay, I just

106
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:27,289
broke the dog house. The dog house is gone. I'm just leveling everything. Don't hit the slug. All

107
00:18:27,289 --> 00:18:44,970
right. How do I get the slug to move? Move. Move. Move. Move. You're taking up all- I need to clear

108
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:55,500
that. Hold on, there's some spots that I missed. I can't- can I get them? All right, we're good.

109
00:18:55,500 --> 00:19:04,630
Let's plant some grass. What should I plant it just down? We'll start at the front. All right.

110
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:13,660
Grass packet. The grass seed packet is simple to use. Press A to go back to the game and look at

111
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:18,299
the buttons in the top right of the screen. They'll tell you what to do with the packet.

112
00:19:18,859 --> 00:19:23,319
If you'd like to know more, press 1 now. Let's plant the whole thing. I mean, I- it's grass.

113
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:26,859
All right, start pouring. Start pouring.

114
00:19:40,390 --> 00:20:02,039
He loves it. Get over there. Are you angry? Oh, here comes a snake. That snake looks like Otto.

115
00:20:09,339 --> 00:20:18,380
Oh, okay. The orange means resident?

116
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:23,980
Resident. Name the new resident. Okay.

117
00:20:32,599 --> 00:20:45,640
What's the- what's the name? Wait, let me get some more- does this cost money? Oh shit, there's

118
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:54,200
another one! This doesn't even cost money? Those who said this was a mobile game, now you know it's

119
00:20:54,200 --> 00:21:03,640
not. What I just did right here would have taken three to five days and probably fifteen dollars.

120
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:11,109
All right, come here. Worm 1. Well, that's not your name.

121
00:21:15,829 --> 00:21:16,710
Weeks, you mean.

122
00:21:24,329 --> 00:21:31,529
Okay, but I want to name this worm. Name. No, direct? Oh, I can tell him to go. All right,

123
00:21:31,609 --> 00:21:38,329
information. You can get information on almost anything by putting the cursor on it and pressing

124
00:21:38,329 --> 00:21:46,339
Y. Let's have some fun. Have some fun. Oh, nice. Then press the left stick to select basic info.

125
00:21:46,339 --> 00:21:52,339
Comic Sans. Now you can change your pinata's name, which helps you to find it in the garden

126
00:21:52,339 --> 00:22:04,099
and keep track of its pinata life. Name it Harvey? Name him Bait. I have ten- okay.

127
00:22:04,819 --> 00:22:13,990
Romance requirements. One out of two. Condition status. All right, let's have ten square

128
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:19,589
pinometers of soil or grass. What the hell is that? There's a worm house in the garden.

129
00:22:19,589 --> 00:22:31,319
Nope, not yet. All right, let's name him. Basic info. Age zero days. Travel- what is-

130
00:22:32,039 --> 00:22:45,930
Worma. Hold on. What do I want to name him? Uh, Worma? No, that's so easy.

131
00:22:46,730 --> 00:23:01,430
Worma or else. Oh my god. Fine, fine, fine, fine. There's gonna be like a hundred of these.

132
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:08,809
Should it be Worma 1? There's gonna be a dozen of these. We'll run around.

133
00:23:09,369 --> 00:23:23,990
Ooh, I got an achievement. Okay, cool. Let's go back. Can I pick more grass? There's another one.

134
00:23:24,549 --> 00:23:35,940
All right, so this is- this is via pinata. There's no point in this game

135
00:23:36,819 --> 00:23:40,980
where they- they hang from a ceiling and you hit them with baseball bats, right? That doesn't

136
00:23:41,059 --> 00:23:55,109
happen. That doesn't happen, right? I shouldn't be preparing for that. It does. I mean, it's called

137
00:23:55,109 --> 00:24:00,759
pinata. Do- do they actually like hang from a string on the ceiling and you go with like a pool

138
00:24:00,759 --> 00:24:15,180
cue and smash them? No, okay. You've attracted a sparrow mid. Sparrow mids can hear a worm wiggling

139
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:24,470
from miles away and will come to take a look. Are they gonna get scooped up? Wait, another one?

140
00:24:26,890 --> 00:24:35,369
Come check out the grass. Look. Yeah. How do you like it? Do you love it? Do you love it here?

141
00:24:36,839 --> 00:24:55,319
Do you love it here? Where's your best friend, Snuffleufagus? Who's this? Willy? Uh, just some

142
00:24:55,319 --> 00:25:01,529
normal guy. Thanks to the five community subs. Thanks a lot. Uh, I'm Willy the- so where's the

143
00:25:01,529 --> 00:25:06,490
voice acting? So you're the new owner. Pleased to meet you. I'm Willy Builder and I put up all

144
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:12,890
the buildings around here. I can see you have two warmas as residents. You'll probably need a few

145
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:19,049
more. All pinata need a house before they will romance. Since you're new here, I'll build you

146
00:25:19,049 --> 00:25:25,259
a worm house on the house. Close this alert and show me where to put the building site. If you'd

147
00:25:25,259 --> 00:25:30,700
like some advice on how to choose a site, press Y now. All right, I need to know this. Seems

148
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:37,240
important. You want to build a house, the cursor changes to carry the building site. Move around

149
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:41,160
the garden to find a good spot. You can't put it down if there isn't real more analog objects in

150
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:48,779
the way. Okay. Spin it around with X to spin the site. Hold it and left stick you can spin it even

151
00:25:48,779 --> 00:25:58,380
more. All right. Just put a block on the ground. I- yeah, but I mean I didn't- this is a huge house!

152
00:25:59,559 --> 00:26:12,039
Oh my- Jesus! This is for a worm? This is bigger than some apartments. Well, how can I tell where

153
00:26:12,119 --> 00:26:21,609
the entrance is? I need grass over there. It's as far in the corner as I can get it.

154
00:26:22,170 --> 00:26:43,109
Is it going? Holy shit, this place sucks. All right, I need grass. I want to put more grass.

155
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:49,579
Award for having a sparrow visit. All right, we need grass.

156
00:26:54,059 --> 00:26:54,859
I can't see the line.

157
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:05,259
Oh, he comes and builds it, I was gonna say. This is a terrible house.

158
00:27:07,339 --> 00:27:25,130
Oh, there he is. Oh, he has a hammer for a head. You're making it out of skin.

159
00:27:30,839 --> 00:27:37,339
New visitor. Oh, here comes a snake. There's a sparrow. I see it. I see it. It's over there.

160
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:43,990
Do they eat each other? They don't eat each other, right?

161
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:56,180
All right, what happened?

162
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:12,869
Wake. Okay, let's smash the building. Where do you stand back? I don't want any splinters.

163
00:28:22,869 --> 00:28:24,309
You mean a McDonald's play place?

164
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:47,210
Okay, so put the cursor over the worms. Hey, that's not your house. Get off.

165
00:28:48,170 --> 00:28:59,420
Do not your house. Okay, select. Now that you have the cursor on a worm, close this alert.

166
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:06,789
All right, we're on two and Wormo. Wait, we need, hold on. I told you this was gonna happen.

167
00:29:07,819 --> 00:29:21,880
I knew this was gonna happen. Just different versions of Wormet, Wormo, Worma, Worma,

168
00:29:39,779 --> 00:29:48,339
Worma and Worma. Okay, Worma and Worma.

169
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:04,539
Okay, Worma and Worma. The snake is coming over here.

170
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:40,890
Okay, secrets. Okay, they're in love. Are they gonna have worm babies?

171
00:30:49,769 --> 00:30:55,769
Poor minigame.

172
00:31:00,970 --> 00:31:29,589
Okay, let's go. So I have to get from here to there. Come get me. I will. Oh, he didn't even

173
00:31:29,589 --> 00:31:45,700
get the fucking secret coin. All right, goodbye. Well, one of you seems to be more excited

174
00:31:45,700 --> 00:32:10,259
than the other. All right. Yeah, let's make some more grass. Grass time. Wait, and you have to

175
00:32:10,259 --> 00:32:44,460
watch them. For kids, this is how, this is how these babies are born. Oh, a new piñata. Oh, it's

176
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:55,380
Storkos. Your piñatas have made an egg. Your piñatas have done the romance dance. A new baby

177
00:32:55,380 --> 00:33:07,720
piñata is brought to the garden, safely packed in a patterned egg. Welcome to kids week. Welcome

178
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:21,420
to kids week, guys. Let me just get enough grass. Missed a spot. I can, I'll fill it in.

179
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:30,630
Oh, right. I have to, I know there's a spot right here. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. I'll get it. I'll

180
00:33:30,630 --> 00:33:45,380
get it. I'll get it. Wink. All right. Your egg's been delivered safely. Can they not be delivered

181
00:33:45,380 --> 00:34:05,000
safely? Oh, there's an egg. Hey, smash the egg. You can change your label by using the label designer

182
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:20,280
from the main menu. Wait, I can make like a Call of Duty emblem? Yeah. Hold on. I gotta,

183
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:28,619
hold on. Wait, wait, wait. I, let me just plant the grass first. No, no, put it that way.

184
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:36,570
Grass. Uh oh.

185
00:34:36,889 --> 00:34:42,889
Are you looking for romance? What? We need more birds?

186
00:34:46,730 --> 00:34:51,940
He's burning up in the sun. Get out of the sun. Oh, no, that means he's a resident.

187
00:34:58,949 --> 00:35:16,920
Oh, there's another one. We're gonna have romance again. Let me do this first. What's going on here?

188
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:25,590
Baby piñata is ready to grow up. The baby goes into a cocoon where it grows to its adult side.

189
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:29,030
If you get impatient, you could give the cocoon some encouragement with your shovel.

190
00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:34,710
If you get impatient, you could give the cocoon some encouragement with your shovel.

191
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:48,010
That's, that's like things you don't want to hear a mob boss say. Okay. Um,

192
00:35:54,280 --> 00:36:07,960
there's a spot right here that I can't get. I still have to make my emblem.

193
00:36:12,679 --> 00:36:17,880
You either live or you die.

194
00:36:22,679 --> 00:36:25,719
Leave some soil. Don't do the whole thing. Leave some soil.

195
00:36:26,519 --> 00:36:29,000
All right for the worms. Okay. Well, let's just make it look nice.

196
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:33,559
It's a little too, it's a little too rigid. Here, a little patch.

197
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:36,760
Just, it looks rigid.

198
00:36:39,079 --> 00:36:41,719
It's more natural. It's more natural look. Here we go.

199
00:36:43,369 --> 00:36:47,369
If you've raised a baby worm, I feel like I can really trust you.

200
00:36:47,929 --> 00:36:52,010
I have two seeds that are ideal for someone starting a new garden.

201
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:57,690
You can have either one. Please choose a seed from either hand by moving the left stick.

202
00:36:57,690 --> 00:37:02,889
All right. What seed do I want to take? The purple pill or the yellow pill?

203
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:15,539
Which one of these wakes me up connected to a toaster? This one, right?

204
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:25,849
Ah, yes. A good choice. When you get back to the garden, your cursor will be holding the seed.

205
00:37:26,409 --> 00:37:32,090
You need to plant this type of seed in soil. Look at the buttons displayed in the top right

206
00:37:32,090 --> 00:37:36,809
of the screen to help you with the seed. Or you can press Y now.

207
00:37:36,809 --> 00:37:39,449
Now I know. I can plant it. Seed choice. Let's go. Where's it going?

208
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:43,269
Where should I plant this? This is important, right?

209
00:37:45,690 --> 00:37:53,480
Uh, how about over here? Like right over here?

210
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:56,809
It's going to go right here, right? It'll make this look nice.

211
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:20,010
Okay. So we can water the plants?

212
00:38:27,610 --> 00:38:30,409
Die.

213
00:38:40,889 --> 00:38:57,750
Kill. Die. This is a kid's game. You're supposed to say defeat or lose. Destroy. Yeah.

214
00:38:58,469 --> 00:38:59,449
This thing looks cool.

215
00:38:59,449 --> 00:39:08,340
Donut. I thought it was a terrier.

216
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:26,119
Why is the watering can so dirty?

217
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:35,340
I don't need information.

218
00:39:36,059 --> 00:39:42,679
All right. So here we go. Short pour. Plant is overwatered.

219
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:49,159
You just gave it to me. You don't say, here, take the watering can and go water the plant.

220
00:39:49,159 --> 00:39:50,039
You did too much.

221
00:40:01,739 --> 00:40:06,840
All right. Get them to romance. Let's see the current status.

222
00:40:07,559 --> 00:40:18,469
Okay. After two worms have romanced, they are ready. What about you?

223
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:39,079
Has eaten one worm. You have to eat one. Who do we eat? Worma? Worma? Or worm? Are you going

224
00:40:39,079 --> 00:40:42,809
for worm three? Here. Have some food.

225
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:15,800
Douse it with water. Whack it with your shovel or keep it away from dinner.

226
00:41:28,059 --> 00:41:50,409
What? I thought I was just going to eat it. Cheering. It just exploded. A bunny comb.

227
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:58,539
Did you see that bunny comb appear? You can smell the carrot?

228
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:12,860
Oh, shit. He's eating them. Oh, wait. That was right. That was there.

229
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:17,500
He's eating them in front of the parents. This is the last of them.

230
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:25,750
All right. Where's the carrot? Have you eaten carrot? Oh, it was a carrot. That's what it was.

231
00:42:26,550 --> 00:42:48,599
It was a carrot. Okay. Are you ready to breed? A lot of new animals coming in. Well done.

232
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:55,320
When the sun goes down, the moth drop will look for a suitable garden.

233
00:42:56,599 --> 00:43:12,599
Okay. I gotta build some more stuff. They sleep. Okay. Hold on. They sleep. I need to...

234
00:43:12,599 --> 00:43:20,980
Where's the builder? Label. Oh, yeah. Label designer. Big bits from phylactery lich.

235
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:31,190
Holy shit. There was 5,000 bits, actually. 50 more dollars from phylactery. They say,

236
00:43:31,190 --> 00:43:34,150
Jeremiah, I found this picture of you browsing around last night. Explain yourself.

237
00:43:35,030 --> 00:43:38,949
Oh, it's the penis shirt. I've shown this. It's the penis shirt thing.

238
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:44,840
Four fucking years ago, somebody made this image. I don't know. I'm just showing it on screen.

239
00:43:49,369 --> 00:43:54,090
It's the penis picture with the smoking camel guy, whatever his name is.

240
00:43:54,889 --> 00:44:03,349
All right. How do I use this? What am I supposed to say? That's... That was like my first t-shirt

241
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:20,179
sale like five years ago. Somebody photo... That's your explanation. No, I'm not gonna show... I've

242
00:44:20,179 --> 00:44:33,110
shown it already. I've shown it like a thousand times. What is going on right now? Wait, wait.

243
00:44:33,110 --> 00:44:56,389
Customize... Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. How do I get like a... Okay. I don't want this. It's gotta

244
00:44:56,389 --> 00:45:09,289
be... My... It's gotta be like the germa colors, right? Don't randomize the colors. Randomize the

245
00:45:09,289 --> 00:45:23,260
shapes. No. Here. The castle. The lightning bolt. The octagon. The puzzle piece. I like the puzzle

246
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:29,429
piece. The mail. I'm not... I don't want this one because I'll think I'll just... I just have mail.

247
00:45:30,230 --> 00:45:35,880
I'll just think that this... I have to click on something. The controller. The Xbox controller.

248
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:59,260
Gamer land. But seriously, five lakhs for it. Thanks for the fucking thousands of dollars.

249
00:45:59,260 --> 00:46:15,610
I want to change the colors of the other one. I don't like this purple. Actually, that's fine.

250
00:46:16,570 --> 00:46:25,719
All right. That's the one I want. And then I want to change this to

251
00:46:30,809 --> 00:46:48,420
Nickelodeon colors. I'm gonna be too bright. That's fine. I like it. It hurts my eyes. It's good.

252
00:46:49,460 --> 00:46:59,139
Would you like to save? Yes, I would. Was there a wink? No fucking way. By the way, Tuesday

253
00:47:00,099 --> 00:47:03,780
is the final day for winks and they're going to be very, very significantly reduced in price.

254
00:47:06,380 --> 00:47:28,469
Significantly. By a huge amount. All right. How's the flower? Can I water the carrot? What do you

255
00:47:28,469 --> 00:47:39,579
do at night? Oh, I need to name you guys? Okay. Has eaten what... You've eaten a worm. What are

256
00:47:39,579 --> 00:47:46,329
you talking about? Was it the wrong person? Oh shit. I think that was the wrong person.

257
00:47:46,329 --> 00:47:53,219
Wrong bird.

258
00:47:57,300 --> 00:48:00,420
Some gardeners use their clock to predict which pinata shows up.

259
00:48:01,139 --> 00:48:18,179
Okay. They both have to eat a worm. Name him Sperma. That would be really funny.

260
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:31,269
What's the building menu? Do I have access to it? Journal? I can't. No, all these animals that

261
00:48:31,269 --> 00:48:37,610
are here right now are going to die. Let's be completely honest. Be upfront with all of this.

262
00:48:37,610 --> 00:48:45,420
Everybody here. They're all going to get eaten. These birds are going to eat the worms and then

263
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:49,340
the snake is going to eat the birds and then the rhino is going to eat the snake.

264
00:48:50,500 --> 00:49:04,059
And then we end up with our character. That's what happens. What can I do at night? Just hang out?

265
00:49:04,619 --> 00:49:18,019
Do we just keep the original worms alive and have the... That's so fucked up though.

266
00:49:18,820 --> 00:49:30,260
We need to have... We need to breed, breed, and breed. All right. Well, how do I get the bunny

267
00:49:30,260 --> 00:49:41,659
to come over here? Come on. Come on. Why is that universal for any animal to come say hello to you?

268
00:49:41,659 --> 00:49:47,139
They probably have no idea what the fuck we're talking about. Come here. What are you... What

269
00:49:47,139 --> 00:49:57,500
are you doing? Oh, listen. Come here. Come on. Get over here. Should I pick it up and give it to him?

270
00:49:57,500 --> 00:50:13,829
All right. You. You. Let's go. Don't eat him. Hold on. You. Yep. Let's go. Oh, bunny combs.

271
00:50:14,469 --> 00:50:19,900
It's a bunny. All right. What do you need? Okay. I got a lot of grass. He needs to eat three carrots

272
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:37,739
and he'll stay. All right. Let's get some extra money. Where do I get the seeds from? What the

273
00:50:37,739 --> 00:51:00,550
fuck was that movement? Go. You unlock the seed NPC later. All right. Are you going for the carrot?

274
00:51:01,690 --> 00:51:10,679
Whatever. You're just going to eat it, I guess. Do you like it? Okay. I need two more of those.

275
00:51:11,929 --> 00:51:25,340
All right. Cool. Good. Please show Otto I need my endorphins. What are you talking about?

276
00:51:26,969 --> 00:51:33,369
Here are the experience petals. I need my endorphins. When you do something to help the

277
00:51:33,369 --> 00:51:39,690
garden, the petals will turn blue. If you'd like some more information about the experience petals,

278
00:51:39,690 --> 00:51:54,329
press Y or level up experience petals. Where you going? Okay. You've filled the

279
00:51:54,329 --> 00:52:01,050
pastels around the clock, which means you've taken a step closer to becoming a truly great gardener.

280
00:52:02,090 --> 00:52:09,980
You shop new items, new pinatas. Good. All right. Level up. Do I pick points?

281
00:52:10,940 --> 00:52:16,619
You've filled the pastels around the clock, which means you've taken a step closer to becoming a

282
00:52:16,619 --> 00:52:24,840
truly great gardener. Okay. Level up. You've filled the pastels around the clock. All right.

283
00:52:27,260 --> 00:52:35,849
Here comes Seedos. I didn't expect the mouse to move. I thought it was a mask. They're not masks.

284
00:52:35,849 --> 00:52:39,929
These are obsessed with gathering seeds. You should try talking to him.

285
00:52:44,980 --> 00:53:02,039
All right. Seedos. Egg delivered. All right. There's the egg. Hey, you too. Do it again.

286
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:16,420
Pick up the egg. Um, didn't it say I can hit the egg? This game is too cute. It's disgusting.

287
00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:36,409
All right. I don't care about the coin. I just want children. All right. So put it down.

288
00:53:36,409 --> 00:54:08,659
Come on. Here it comes. Worm four. He's looking. He's so cute. Yes. I want to talk to you too.

289
00:54:08,659 --> 00:54:15,460
Come here. Hey, Seedos. What do you got? Hello. I'm Seedos. Take a seed and don't hit me with your

290
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:28,519
spade. Don't tell me not to do it. I'm going to do it. Have a seed. Carrots. Let's put it over here.

291
00:54:34,340 --> 00:54:55,110
Beat his ass. Jesus. All right. Wada. All right. Do not hit him. Worm four. All right. Here comes an egg.

292
00:54:56,710 --> 00:55:01,820
All right. What just happened? Why did worm four just explode?

293
00:55:04,789 --> 00:55:26,820
Eat this. Don't you want to eat this? The builder shop is now open. Okay. Good. Okay. My menu. Okay.

294
00:55:27,219 --> 00:55:30,179
Good. All right. Fine.

295
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:08,199
Where's the seed, dude? You said you dropped one. I was just kidding.

296
00:56:09,639 --> 00:56:19,639
Keep hitting him. No. There's a wink. I get it. Why would I keep hitting the guy that just told

297
00:56:19,639 --> 00:56:25,460
me he was going to come back and put weeds in my garden if I hit him? All right. It's time. We've

298
00:56:25,460 --> 00:56:33,909
got to feed. Worm four. Nope. It's all right. It's time to. We need info here. Put this away.

299
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:45,500
Okay. How old are they? Age one day old. Okay. So that's not that big of a deal. Call the guy's

300
00:56:45,579 --> 00:57:04,199
bluff. All right. Sparrow, come here. We need to. You eat a worm. You. Now let's build a birdhouse.

301
00:57:08,780 --> 00:57:16,280
Willy builder. He wants the worm. You roll a slot machine.

302
00:57:16,599 --> 00:57:21,639
Established 20 years. Regional award winner for services to island housing.

303
00:57:21,639 --> 00:57:28,119
You need some work done. Pinata and helper accommodation. A specialty. I know my trade.

304
00:57:28,119 --> 00:57:40,730
Don't you worry. I have to roll for a building. Buy items. Okay. Sparrow home. Price. 165. Place

305
00:57:40,730 --> 00:57:46,730
the work shed down where you want the building. Then I can get started. Payment up front though,

306
00:57:46,730 --> 00:57:58,599
if you please. Why would I not pay you up front? I'm going to keep the birds away from the worms.

307
00:58:01,539 --> 00:58:06,090
Yeah. I'm going to put them over here. We don't want any fighting.

308
00:58:11,670 --> 00:58:15,510
If I could just ask you to pay the balance. All right. Didn't I already do that?

309
00:58:16,309 --> 00:58:26,869
We had a raid come in. Why malicious welcome everybody from why malicious is a

310
00:58:27,829 --> 00:58:36,360
raid playing pinata. The game's fucked up. It likes flowers. Any kind. That's all I got.

311
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:52,539
That's all I got. Here's a taffy. It likes flowers. Any kind will do a taffy. I think there's

312
00:58:52,539 --> 00:59:06,489
too many animals to keep track of, but thanks a lot. Welcome guys. Congratulations. You have

313
00:59:06,489 --> 00:59:12,570
attracted. I already got it. I got it. Sometimes they are attracted by the noises of other animals

314
00:59:12,570 --> 00:59:17,980
and sometimes the scent of flowers brings them. All right. Flowers and smell.

315
00:59:20,699 --> 00:59:28,969
How many new characters are there? You should all know my store's open again.

316
00:59:28,969 --> 00:59:33,210
I expect to see you in here very soon. Just bring lots of cash.

317
00:59:34,329 --> 00:59:39,130
Nobody likes the taste of chocolate coins more than Lottie, I can tell you. Shop get.

318
00:59:39,849 --> 00:59:41,130
Okay. All right. Can I?

319
00:59:48,489 --> 00:59:53,289
They're chocolate coins? It's not even real money.

320
01:00:01,210 --> 01:00:08,659
Everything is candy. So the currency here, what's the US dollar equivalent? A bag of

321
01:00:08,739 --> 01:00:16,420
30 of those little chocolate coins is like 80 cents, isn't it? Oh boy. Okay.

322
01:00:18,199 --> 01:00:24,679
Now cost a loss is open. You can buy romance sweets. If you have romance, the pinata species

323
01:00:24,679 --> 01:00:31,400
before you could replace all their requirements, except their house with a romance suite. Buy a

324
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:38,679
suite and direct a pinata to it. They should eat it and instantly they will have to show they are

325
01:00:38,679 --> 01:00:44,519
ready to romance. This should make romancing pinata easier. You need to feed pinatas.

326
01:00:47,159 --> 01:00:54,219
Romance candies. All right. Can I open this thing now? Or is there anything else you'd like to

327
01:00:54,219 --> 01:01:17,539
traffic jam tutorial me with? All right. That's gone. Have you eaten? What about you? You have

328
01:01:17,539 --> 01:01:23,639
eaten. I need to spare a house and then you need to eat a worm. Don't eat him.

329
01:01:32,199 --> 01:01:37,590
The happy meter tells you about your pinata's mood. Every time something happens to the pinata,

330
01:01:37,590 --> 01:01:42,949
orange or blue, turn orange or turn blue. The more orange triangles a pinata has,

331
01:01:42,949 --> 01:01:48,469
the happier it is. And you can see this on the face in the middle. Okay. Let's see. How happy are you?

332
01:01:50,219 --> 01:02:11,099
You're all right. Eat. Who is this? Worm five. Eat worm five. Go for it. This is sad. Wait,

333
01:02:11,099 --> 01:02:16,219
is the snake going to come over and get free candy? Look at the snake. What does the snake eat?

334
01:02:17,739 --> 01:02:41,820
No, no. That was your brother. Oh, okay. Well, what does the snake need? It needs to eat a mouse

335
01:02:41,820 --> 01:03:02,300
mallow. You got it. All right. Open it up. They will now live here. Oh, that was horrible. All

336
01:03:02,300 --> 01:03:12,380
right. There you go, guys. We need more breeding. Okay. I'm going to make another worm. Should I

337
01:03:12,940 --> 01:03:38,500
make another worm discovery zone? Should I do that? No. I need another egg. We need to have a

338
01:03:38,500 --> 01:03:50,420
ton of worms because there's going to be a bunch of sparrows. The dumb birds won't even sleep in

339
01:03:50,420 --> 01:04:13,699
the bed. Oh, no. He's going to die. Screamer sucks at kids' games. It's not a kids' game.

340
01:04:13,780 --> 01:04:24,570
I keep getting corrected. Builder back at the store. All right.

341
01:04:24,570 --> 01:04:31,670
Pretz tail? There's so many animals.

342
01:04:42,309 --> 01:04:49,769
Bro, you're fucked. What? Is a pretz tail going to... What's wrong with the pretz tail?

343
01:04:52,900 --> 01:05:04,039
Wait. Oh, I got to water this. I need to buy some seeds too. More?

344
01:05:04,039 --> 01:05:26,070
Good. More? Kill the pretz tail. You're not selecting it. Make those birds have sex. I will.

345
01:05:26,070 --> 01:05:48,420
I'm going to buy some seeds. Oh, was it an onion? It's a mystery seed. All right. We're going to

346
01:05:48,420 --> 01:05:57,289
put plants over here. Put it right here. The egg. Oh, I don't know why I thought that eggs were

347
01:05:57,289 --> 01:06:08,469
going to grow on that. Okay. Talk more? Come on. I can't leave. I'm confined to this space. What is it?

348
01:06:17,559 --> 01:06:24,170
Big one. All right. Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop,

349
01:06:24,170 --> 01:06:39,050
pouring. Where do I get water? Hold on. There's a... Come on, get in here. I'm going to get this big

350
01:06:39,929 --> 01:06:45,619
monarch butterfly, whatever it is. Get in here. All right. What do you want? How do I get you to

351
01:06:45,619 --> 01:06:57,260
stay? You're beautiful. Has a light in the garden. Oh, I need a light. I need a lamp. Build me a lamp.

352
01:07:11,940 --> 01:07:17,179
Stop ad-libbing, Jerma. Don't ad-lib. Read the script. Case in point, what you just saw right

353
01:07:17,179 --> 01:07:27,269
there. There's no, I can't do one yet. Can I buy from the other store?

354
01:07:37,079 --> 01:07:38,360
From this store here?

355
01:07:41,750 --> 01:07:47,909
If it isn't the new gardener in town, you're guaranteed a warm welcome at Costalot's store.

356
01:07:47,909 --> 01:07:53,349
Whether you're here to buy or sell, which will it be today? It's sell. Highlight and select one and

357
01:07:53,349 --> 01:08:03,400
let's get those coins flowing. Happy shopping. All right. What we got? Buy items, seeds, candy,

358
01:08:03,400 --> 01:08:13,699
vegetables, fence, lamp, firebrand. That's a lamp, right? Give me that lamp.

359
01:08:19,670 --> 01:08:27,880
All right. I'm going to put it right over here. Right here. Hey, look what I got.

360
01:08:38,500 --> 01:08:51,930
No, no, no. Check out, check out, check, yeah, yeah, yeah. What the hell is that?

361
01:08:51,930 --> 01:09:04,060
I thought I was, I thought I could place two. It's all right. He'll be back. All right. You,

362
01:09:04,300 --> 01:09:15,270
no, I don't want the birds to start having kids. The more birds that, why they don't have a tag?

363
01:09:15,270 --> 01:09:22,550
If there's a bunch of bird kids, they're going to eat. Sell them. You can sell the kids. What?

364
01:09:25,560 --> 01:09:44,600
We need more worms first. I'm not comfortable having three birds. Okay, here comes another one.

365
01:09:53,399 --> 01:10:03,270
They don't need to eat. They only have to eat if you want to breed them. Oh, well, there's going to

366
01:10:03,270 --> 01:10:11,289
be, all right. Well, they'll be, they're going to be quite a few of these. All right. You two,

367
01:10:11,289 --> 01:10:27,989
it's time to make a bird child. You, come here. Where's the other one? Come on, stop going out.

368
01:10:27,989 --> 01:10:55,500
Come here. You two, go enjoy each other's company. Go enjoy each other's company. All right. I got,

369
01:10:55,500 --> 01:11:03,619
I got smack citos. No, I'll talk to citos. He's going to give me another seed.

370
01:11:03,939 --> 01:11:09,460
There's nothing more valuable than a seed.

371
01:11:12,090 --> 01:11:25,109
Me? Thank you. And put it right here. Hey, you, come here. Talk to me again.

372
01:11:25,989 --> 01:11:31,350
All the seeds are mine, but I'm kind so other people can borrow them.

373
01:11:32,729 --> 01:11:47,939
Me another one? Oh man, he's throwing them out like crazy. Wait, what? Hold on. What, what does

374
01:11:47,939 --> 01:12:01,289
this weird elephant be? Hold on. What the hell are you? A taffy has eaten one flower. So the

375
01:12:01,289 --> 01:12:18,810
taffy wants to live here now. How do I make it? This thing's cool. That is really cute. Yeah,

376
01:12:18,810 --> 01:12:26,569
I like this thing. Okay. So now what? Has eaten one poppy. I need a taffy house in the garden.

377
01:12:27,369 --> 01:12:30,760
I'm thinking, do I have any poppies? So this is a carrot, right?

378
01:12:30,760 --> 01:13:04,710
Okay. Nice. What about this? Are these two both carrots? Don't eat that. Hey. All right. Do they

379
01:13:04,710 --> 01:13:22,869
have a kid yet? Look inside. You can go into the house. This is kind of cool. You can just say,

380
01:13:22,869 --> 01:13:35,739
put your eye up and look. All right. How's everybody doing? Lots of worm kids. Still need

381
01:13:35,739 --> 01:13:44,500
to find out how to get you here. I need you guys to read. I need the bunny to come back.

382
01:13:44,500 --> 01:13:55,340
Come here. Breed. I can't select you. If you're just going to stand up on top there.

383
01:13:55,979 --> 01:14:05,319
Do I just make sure? I'm just going to give him a breed candy. Oh, wait, wait, wait. Look inside.

384
01:14:05,960 --> 01:14:30,340
Oh, that was cute. All right. Can we? He's eating another flower.

385
01:14:32,229 --> 01:14:39,770
Don't eat that. Not yet. I need more flowers. Have to fly, fly into the fire and he'll turn into a

386
01:14:39,770 --> 01:14:53,300
new... Can I make him do that? Wait, have him fly into the fire. Why would I do that?

387
01:14:54,260 --> 01:15:02,119
Is that like a huge spoiler for the game? Oh, I thought you guys were just being dicks.

388
01:15:02,840 --> 01:15:19,130
I'm not doing that yet. I'm not doing that yet. I want to go buy some more stuff.

389
01:15:20,010 --> 01:15:32,420
Well, can I make it more buildings? Afternoon, come on in. Big spenders welcome. All right.

390
01:15:32,420 --> 01:15:39,579
Fertilizer, seeds, paving, fences, garden items, produce, vegetables. How much money do I have?

391
01:15:42,649 --> 01:15:49,930
Seeds. Oh, these are cheap. Buttercup, daisy, turnip, carrots. All right. I'm going to buy

392
01:15:49,930 --> 01:16:14,260
a ton of carrots. Let's put carrots over here. Point two, three. They're cheap. They're really

393
01:16:14,260 --> 01:16:33,399
cheap. I'm going to have like a whole section. I want that bunny rabbit to come back. Shitload

394
01:16:33,399 --> 01:16:49,500
of carrots. Okay. That's it. Buttercup, daisy, thistle. All right. I'm going to hold off for

395
01:16:49,500 --> 01:16:57,989
now. Go back. Produce. I can just buy this shit. Wait, honey. That's a lot of money.

396
01:16:58,869 --> 01:17:04,869
It's going to be a bunny invasion. Carrot. These are too expensive. Why would I buy these?

397
01:17:06,899 --> 01:17:19,720
Garden items, pile of leaves, ornamental stones. All right. How about an ornamental stone? All

398
01:17:19,720 --> 01:17:28,220
right. Ornamental stone is going to go. I just want it. I want it. I want an ornamental stone.

399
01:17:28,220 --> 01:18:02,310
What's wrong with that? See? Look at how much they love it. Pile of leaves. All right. How about a

400
01:18:02,310 --> 01:18:24,039
pile of leaves? Pile of leaves is going to go right over here. Good. Okay. Omega Lo, no money.

401
01:18:28,680 --> 01:18:43,239
I want fun stuff for them to do. This is grass right now. This is just grass. Time to start

402
01:18:43,239 --> 01:19:01,210
selling your piñatas for money. Sell. I can sell them for 100 bucks? Two snakes. All right. I need

403
01:19:01,210 --> 01:19:08,279
to make the snakes happy. All right. No, no. I'm not going to do this yet. I don't need to do this.

404
01:19:11,270 --> 01:19:13,750
So my chocolate coins. Thank you. Come again.

405
01:19:18,470 --> 01:19:25,479
All right. I got the carrots. I want a bunch of, uh, these all good to go. I've got a seed here.

406
01:19:26,119 --> 01:19:33,220
A carrot seed. All right. Where are the bunnies? And you?

407
01:19:33,859 --> 01:19:47,960
Where the? I need a mouse. How do I attract a mouse? Let me know the seed.

408
01:19:49,819 --> 01:19:59,590
If you like seeds, smile. I don't think you're. I need tall grass. What is this?

409
01:20:00,550 --> 01:20:10,579
And what is this? The daisy. Is it bloomed? No, it's got to go more than that, right?

410
01:20:11,220 --> 01:20:31,859
It's only worth $10. It's a dead flower. No, it's not. All right. Should I go to the

411
01:20:31,859 --> 01:20:37,779
information? It's already grown. All right. Everyone's sleeping in their houses, except

412
01:20:37,779 --> 01:20:42,659
for the snakes. The snakes just leave during the day. This is looking like a pretty nice little

413
01:20:42,659 --> 01:21:03,829
ecosystem. What's over here? Oh, look at this place. Oh, butterflies back. I need a butterfly

414
01:21:03,829 --> 01:21:17,579
containment zone. Ego maniac makes ego system. Quick look in the houses. Oh shit. That's right.

415
01:21:17,579 --> 01:21:31,829
I don't want to wake them up though. Nice. They need to have some children. You can make

416
01:21:31,829 --> 01:21:37,100
worms happy if you water them. I don't think that that I don't think that's accurate. Look

417
01:21:37,100 --> 01:21:51,989
at this. This is a big family in here. It's a sleepover. What's the painting of a squirrel?

418
01:22:01,210 --> 01:22:14,979
Worma, Worma and Worm 7, Worm 4, Worm 6. All right. Give me those rabbits. I want you to stick

419
01:22:14,979 --> 01:22:37,350
around. You need to make a little moth house. Hey, Cito, give me the seed now. I'll swap you

420
01:22:37,350 --> 01:22:53,029
a seed for 10 chocolate coins. This person is weird. Oh yeah. You like it? Yeah. All right.

421
01:22:53,029 --> 01:23:07,140
I think we have a resident. We do. New resident. Yes. All right. Has eaten one thistle and then a

422
01:23:07,140 --> 01:23:20,279
mystery. Let's rename this to Jermoff. I would have been so into this when I was younger.

423
01:23:24,859 --> 01:23:31,239
Imagine coming home from school every day and opening this. Oh, it's so good. It would have

424
01:23:31,239 --> 01:23:42,489
been so fun. What is this thistle? What are you? Daisy? I need a thistle. Back to the store. That's

425
01:23:42,489 --> 01:23:54,069
a fox. I need a rabbit. Is the rabbit gone? No. Come on. Where's the rabbit? I need some thistle.

426
01:23:59,239 --> 01:24:02,600
All right. I'm going to buy like four or five thistles. Put them in the corner.

427
01:24:03,319 --> 01:24:11,479
The rabbit is resident sleeper. Good morning. Right eyed, bushy tailed, and ready to spend.

428
01:24:12,840 --> 01:24:29,210
What about fertilizer? Do I just do this? Orange fertilizer? Bonus growth. I don't want to do that

429
01:24:29,210 --> 01:24:35,529
right now. You know, this could start to get annoying. Yeah, like you every time I open the

430
01:24:35,529 --> 01:24:46,739
store. No, no, no. Not fertilizer. Seeds. I need thistle down here. All right. The 13 bucks.

431
01:24:46,739 --> 01:24:58,569
So that's your. He's sleeping. Oh, that's so cute. All right. You're when the thistle is

432
01:24:58,569 --> 01:25:13,699
going to be over here by the fire because they love this shit. I'm going to do thistle. Nice try.

433
01:25:13,699 --> 01:25:17,779
Cheapskate. You don't have enough money. You don't have the cash for that. Spend what you do. Okay.

434
01:25:17,779 --> 01:25:30,060
Finish shopping. All right. Now. No credit or refund. All right. Now it's time to sell some

435
01:25:31,500 --> 01:25:31,899
children.

436
01:25:42,020 --> 01:25:55,220
Water these thistles. Very good. Oh, yes. Right this way. The carrot buffet is waiting for you.

437
01:25:59,829 --> 01:26:10,859
Ew. Funny comb. Has eaten a daisy or has eaten a buttercup? You don't eat carrots? Wait, why

438
01:26:10,859 --> 01:26:28,859
don't you eat carrots? There's so many carrots. What the fuck is happening? Kind of scary. You

439
01:26:28,859 --> 01:26:46,539
don't eat carrots? Carrots are the ginger vegetable. This doesn't put pinatas up and you'll

440
01:26:46,539 --> 01:26:58,260
have to look out for them or they'll be eaten. Somebody has to eat these, right?

441
01:27:00,500 --> 01:27:21,479
Do you eat carrots? A squazzle. You guys were talking shit about me putting the leaves in

442
01:27:21,479 --> 01:27:42,470
the stones. Now we've got a squazzle. Are you guys still having kids? Someone warn him please. What?

443
01:27:49,560 --> 01:28:12,779
The ground is overflowing with worms. All right. We're good. He doesn't know. Pepe left. Pepe left.

444
01:28:12,779 --> 01:28:30,149
I don't know either. He doesn't know. I don't either. All right. Can we? The birds have to

445
01:28:30,149 --> 01:28:41,210
breed. Get over here. Bird. Stop perching up so I can't select you if you're up that high. Move.

446
01:28:42,090 --> 01:29:06,300
The gardening is improving. All right. Move. Get off. Off. Off. Get off. Get off. Out. Whoa.

447
01:29:06,939 --> 01:29:23,100
There's a bunny spider? A raise ant. That thing's crazy. The longer you work in the... Oh no. People

448
01:29:23,100 --> 01:29:39,130
of far and wide are hearing about how awesome the garden is. Okay. We got... Look. Another one.

449
01:29:41,529 --> 01:29:49,720
Another one. Keep eating. Eat as much as you want. All right. Now give me this. What is that thing?

450
01:29:50,279 --> 01:30:15,340
Sour Shelly bean. It eats seeds? Why does he look evil? A seed feast? So a hit with shovel.

451
01:30:19,659 --> 01:30:20,300
What is going on?

452
01:30:25,579 --> 01:30:27,500
Ha, ha, ha.

453
01:31:27,800 --> 01:31:43,939
Okay. I'm sorry. It's a seed feast. All right. Where is he? Oh. A new resident. All right. Give

454
01:31:43,939 --> 01:31:49,779

455
01:31:49,779 --> 01:32:10,520
over here? Come on. Oh, I want you over here too. Look at this. All right. I have children. No.

456
01:32:10,520 --> 01:32:25,590
You're always so far away from each other. Yep. Go over here. Throw it in the fire. I want you to

457
01:32:25,590 --> 01:32:34,699
get down. I'm trying to breed. I am. I have children. I'm... More worms. I think I have enough

458
01:32:34,699 --> 01:33:07,779
worms. What is this? Oh. Fanny Franker? This is a base for a mailbox? What? Well, this doesn't

459
01:33:07,779 --> 01:33:37,430
exist anymore. Another cocoon hatched. Good. More worms. Okay. This is... I'm done with worms after

460
01:33:37,430 --> 01:33:42,310
this and I'm going to do everything I can possible to get those sparrows. You're not worming your...

461
01:33:42,310 --> 01:33:59,100
Oh, there's a hand. I'm so sick of this worm minigame. All right. Finally. Land. You and you

462
01:34:00,060 --> 01:34:31,369
go. You know what to do. Here it comes. Come and get me. It's just free money. It's the same

463
01:34:31,369 --> 01:34:45,140
minigame. Just a little different. I'm coming. I'm coming. Get ya. Yes. You got me. You found me.

464
01:34:45,779 --> 01:34:55,930
Do we get to see their fun dance thing? All right. Here we go. It's the moment we've all been waiting

465
01:34:55,930 --> 01:35:50,039
for. This is kind of weird. I'm like, all right, let me look. All right. Now do it again. No. We

466
01:35:50,039 --> 01:35:57,479
can't. What's wrong with you? What's going on? Why are you on fire? Is this on fire? Are you on fire?

467
01:35:58,199 --> 01:36:16,899
What's going on? It's on fire? How do I... Why are you on fire? He's gonna die. He's not gonna die. All

468
01:36:16,899 --> 01:36:33,609
right. Give me a seed. What is this? Is this a seed? This is more cube than seed. Where should it go?

469
01:36:34,329 --> 01:36:56,869
Over here? How's everything else look? How the thistles look? Go eat those carrots.

470
01:36:57,510 --> 01:37:01,500
That's what they're there for. We fell asleep eating. It's okay. When you wake up in the morning,

471
01:37:01,500 --> 01:37:07,750
you eat them. Anything else need watering? Over here. Oh, shit. I think these are dying.

472
01:37:08,310 --> 01:37:32,710
No, these are fine. What is in here? Stop. Stop. Stop. You're gonna kill it. Okay. A baby?

473
01:37:34,890 --> 01:37:42,550
Oh, yeah. Look, a little baby. That's not your house. Get out of here. He thinks he's a sparrow.

474
01:37:42,550 --> 01:38:00,489
Hi, sparrow. No, you're not. Get out of here. Eat a daisy or a buttercup. Okay.

475
01:38:08,300 --> 01:38:20,180
Shovel upgrade. Nice. It actually is intact. This is progress, but it's very slow.

476
01:38:20,739 --> 01:38:24,020
Let's see if a better shovel will make you a better gardener.

477
01:38:24,659 --> 01:38:29,460
This is the seed shovel. You can dig seed holes with it by pressing A.

478
01:38:30,340 --> 01:38:37,060
I'm sure you'll work out what seed holes are for. So this is to make them grow better, faster.

479
01:38:38,020 --> 01:38:56,220
That makes sense. Okay. How's everybody doing? Another baby. The carrots are gonna rot.

480
01:38:57,100 --> 01:39:08,579
I just sell them? How much is the reward for growing corn? Ten bucks to sell. Okay. Sell.

481
01:39:10,300 --> 01:39:17,140
Sell. Sell. Sell. Sell. Sell. Sell. Sell. Sell. All right. Sell this one too.

482
01:39:19,750 --> 01:39:39,109

483
01:39:39,109 --> 01:39:49,380

714
02:40:42,629 --> 02:40:52,139
just pick it up every now and then aimed animals do not eat stuff well i can make them eat and then

715
02:40:52,139 --> 02:40:57,340

908
03:34:52,780 --> 03:34:57,750
did just to get it started because we've already kind of seen the beginning that's unacceptable

909
03:34:57,750 --> 03:35:02,600
let's say i think that's acceptable to just say you don't have to so you guys don't have to see

that this is how you clear a dirt with a shovel all right oh well we want to watch all right we

03:47:37,420 --> 03:47:43,770
that's really cool i hope it's good when they redid uh the teenage mutant ninja turtles beat

971
03:47:43,770 --> 03:47:53,899
them up it was absolutely fucking atrocious so old beat them ups they they try to translate them into

972
03:47:53,899 --> 03:47:59,610
3d and they try to translate them into the kind of 2020 i haven't played one that i thought was

973
03:47:59,610 --> 03:48:04,250
any good that was supposed to be some kind of reimagining a remake of an old classic

974
03:48:05,049 --> 03:48:16,420
sure there have been some beat them ups that have come out that are 2d they made the original

975
03:48:16,420 --> 03:48:27,799
battle toads so it should be good i hope so looks cool making a breath of the wild clone

976
03:48:27,799 --> 03:48:36,260
really look into that hey lucas or lucius thanks for the 500 bits hey german just want to show

977
03:48:36,260 --> 03:48:40,340
some appreciation i know this was a while back but i really loved your outer world stream so

978
03:48:40,340 --> 03:48:45,559
i'm thinking of playing it myself i don't usually play scary games but i think having what you play

979
03:48:45,559 --> 03:48:53,239
at first is going to help anyway have a good night that game is only as scary as you make it

980
03:48:53,719 --> 03:49:02,579
it's more exploration than it is scary like if you fly a thousand miles per hour into a planet

981
03:49:02,579 --> 03:49:10,250
you'll scream that's scary i did it a lot is that it was actually terrifying but the game itself is

982
03:49:12,979 --> 03:49:19,979
the anglerfish are kind of terrifying and i guess you can't just avoid that place

983
03:49:20,620 --> 03:49:24,569
you know what i mean like it's not just like oh i just won't do that part well you have to

984
03:49:24,569 --> 03:49:28,889
you know what i mean you have to like do you have to go to like that all the planets like you can

985
03:49:28,969 --> 03:49:38,680
skip it but yeah hope you have fun with it it was a great game it was very very very fun

986
03:49:43,049 --> 03:49:54,200
a grave embrace thanks to the 360 three dollars and 60 cents uh they linked up an image it says

987

989
03:50:11,479 --> 03:50:25,719

message thanks a lot dude you continue to give stupid amounts of money to the stream it's a lot

993
03:51:05,979 --> 03:51:10,459
going to give you a million dollars no i made it really clear i don't i don't i don't take bribes

994
03:51:11,180 --> 03:51:23,219
but thanks a lot sam freelance police thanks for the 500 bits hey germa i turned 20 on monday

995
03:51:23,940 --> 03:51:32,969
happy 20th birthday hope you had a good one what did you eat what did you eat on your birthday

996
03:51:33,530 --> 03:51:48,459
corned beef hash what was it is it corned beef hash corned beef hash all right nice

997
03:51:49,260 --> 03:51:56,579
this one i always have to make sure people are eating that i'm having a mild crisis though i'm

998
03:51:56,579 --> 03:52:01,219
studying game design in university but i also recently got into music production i had a lot

999
03:52:01,219 --> 03:52:06,739
more fun working on a song i sent you than any game design project and i've been spending my

1000
03:52:06,739 --> 03:52:11,540
semester break learning and doing more music stuff i feel like i'm going to pursue this

1001
03:52:11,540 --> 03:52:16,979
professionally i don't know what to focus on now for a future career if i should switch courses

1002
03:52:16,979 --> 03:52:25,049
or stay have you got any advice the best advice that i could possibly give for something like this

1003
03:52:28,360 --> 03:52:38,180
is i would try to do them both now i don't know how far into game design you are

1004
03:52:38,739 --> 03:52:48,069
because you say i'm studying game design at university how far into game design university

1005
03:52:48,069 --> 03:52:56,899
are you just do both well what i mean by that is you can make music in your free time but also

1006
03:52:56,899 --> 03:53:07,829
study to do something like game design and like i said before i don't know how many years or so

1007
03:53:07,829 --> 03:53:20,860
you've been pursuing a game design degree that's literally what i'm going to do yeah you're making

1008
03:53:20,860 --> 03:53:28,569
progress learning music on your own keep studying game design work on music as a passion yeah now

1009
03:53:28,569 --> 03:53:34,090
one of the arguments against that would be well i can't dedicate my time to both the same time

1010
03:53:34,090 --> 03:53:38,889
and put the passion i want to put into my music projects because of all the stuff i have to put

1011
03:53:38,889 --> 03:53:46,760
into my game design schoolwork and projects but that's how you try to make a balance just

1012
03:53:46,760 --> 03:53:58,020
for your life in general and it is hard to do that it is hard to work and do a passion at the

1013
03:53:58,020 --> 03:54:05,829
same time it is hard to have two passions that you equally care about and give them both the

1014
03:54:05,829 --> 03:54:15,270
same amount of attention it's hard to do that but i would say for as long as you can and depending

1015
03:54:15,270 --> 03:54:19,750
on like i said how long you've been in school for i would try to keep up getting your degree in game

1016
03:54:19,750 --> 03:54:36,379
design while doing music on the side but also i am not you if i really really cared about music

1017
03:54:36,379 --> 03:54:41,659
production and that's i that i know it now i this is all i fucking care about it's all i want to do

1018
03:54:43,299 --> 03:54:46,100
there's also that scenario where you'll finish your game design degree

1019
03:54:48,059 --> 03:54:54,059
and you'll be like well i don't even want to do this now it actually that that's not

1020
03:54:55,930 --> 03:55:01,500
unfortunately that's not necessarily an uncommon thing that happens in college

1021
03:55:01,500 --> 03:55:05,180
a lot of people will go to school for something and then just decide that it's not something they

1022
03:55:05,180 --> 03:55:19,909
wanted to do so it can be tricky and i unfortunately i don't have the right answer for you i think you

1023
03:55:19,909 --> 03:55:39,610
already might know the answer i think you might already know the answer i don't feels good man

1024
03:55:40,889 --> 03:55:51,110
but i wish you luck whatever you do whether you pursue music or you pursue game design or you try

1025
03:55:51,110 --> 03:56:00,069
to do them both i wish you luck some people switch their major several times it's more

1026
03:56:00,069 --> 03:56:12,549
common to switch than your major than not right that's true feels amazing man i don't know

1027
03:56:13,350 --> 03:56:25,659
but i wish you luck thanks for the five bucks gave the idiot thanks for the five dollars as well

1028

04:00:33,379 --> 04:00:39,559
for the 400 bits check out amazing island for the game cube might be a good stream game i think i

1057
04:00:39,559 --> 04:00:50,299
was looking at that i didn't buy it though i was looking at it i think amazing island yeah i was

1058
04:00:50,299 --> 04:01:03,610
looking at this maybe i'll get it and finally blueberry juice with 250 thanks to the 250 they

1059
04:01:03,610 --> 04:01:09,049
say hey germa chan i also very much agree on you streaming the yakuza games again although i would

1060
04:01:09,049 --> 04:01:15,879
recommend one of the games with less mini game grinding like the businesses in yakuza zero okay

1061
04:01:15,959 --> 04:01:20,920
some other good starters are yakuza four or three those two are way more straight to the point

1062
04:01:21,719 --> 04:01:27,319
plus they're really easy they're really easy to get invested into yakuza zero is the meme one so

1063
04:01:27,319 --> 04:01:50,680
that's a bummer here's a clip of some of the chaos you might see all right all right all right okay

1064
04:01:50,680 --> 04:01:58,700
all right i might just play it all right i know they're fucking funny and they're crazy i know i

1065
04:01:58,700 --> 04:02:06,469
know i know i know i know i really should play them just for some i got i probably shouldn't

1066
04:02:06,469 --> 04:02:13,479
start with the cures of zero it was that was one that was in the ps4 though but uh without

1067
04:02:13,479 --> 04:02:16,760
further ado i've got to get out of here i spent it actually a little more time than i was supposed

1068
04:02:16,760 --> 04:02:21,879
to today but it's okay i can still get the hell out of here right now and go do the errand that

1069
04:02:21,879 --> 04:02:26,200
i need to do and then do the stuff i need to do this weekend have a great weekend goodbye

1070
04:02:26,200 --> 04:02:46,870
good night see you soon take care everybody see you tuesday
