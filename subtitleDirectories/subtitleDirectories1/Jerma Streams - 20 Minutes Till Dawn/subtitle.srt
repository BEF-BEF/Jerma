1
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:09,529
What about Rumbleverse? I've heard of it, but I haven't played it.

2
00:00:09,529 --> 00:00:18,519
Alright, what's it called? 20 minutes? Is it on Steam?

3
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:24,850
20 minutes till dawn. Okay. Early access.

4
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:31,089
This is also $3! Vampire Survivors is $3 too, isn't it? Or $2?

5
00:00:31,089 --> 00:00:39,460
That's interesting. Okay.

6
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:45,429
Uh, stream might have an issue here, because I'm about to be sick.

7
00:00:45,429 --> 00:00:55,679
I'm downloading a game right now, so the stream might, like, die. Are we good?

8
00:00:55,679 --> 00:01:07,540
Rumbleverse is fun. This game's 100 megabytes. Damn.

9
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:11,060
Okay, let's see how it is.

10
00:01:20,359 --> 00:01:36,969
20 minutes till dawn. How about? Stop!

11
00:01:36,969 --> 00:01:49,469
Yeah, 100 megabytes.

12
00:01:49,469 --> 00:01:56,680
Dude, I don't even need to change the name of the title.

13
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:04,260
Trying out this new game, right?

14
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:08,080
Alright, how are the options? Is this a controller game?

15
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:20,330
Thank you. I can turn that off.

16
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:30,259
Should I do controller, or should I do mouse and keyboard?

17
00:02:30,259 --> 00:02:31,360
Controller? Okay.

18
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,860
This is the only character that I have. Standard mode, endless mode.

19
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:37,610
Standard mode. Ten minutes survival. Alright.

20
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:44,960
20 minutes? Standard mode. Yeah.

21
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:50,460
Okay. Flip to shoot. It's a right trigger to shoot.

22
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:53,439
I actually would probably prefer mouse and keyboard.

23
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:57,120
Yeah, definitely. Oh yeah, without a doubt. Hold on.

24
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:14,439
I need to turn the sensitivity down. Can I turn the sensitivity down?

25
00:03:14,439 --> 00:03:25,789
Auto-aim. Oh, okay.

26
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:36,750
This is fun. Choose an upgrade. Double shot?

27
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:42,870
Dark arts. Ooh, it's like a crit.

28
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:52,340
Bullet speed? Max vitality? Ghost friend. Ghost friend.

29
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:55,750
This is a full-on genre now.

30
00:03:55,750 --> 00:04:00,849
That actually makes me really happy, because Vampire Survivors is so fucking fun.

31
00:04:00,849 --> 00:04:05,750
This type of game is so fun. I hope these guys make millions of dollars

32
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:09,150
setting this genre. Right?

33
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:12,770
I hope they make millions of dollars.

34
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:15,270
And then it's like, okay, a bunch of people are making games that are like this too,

35
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:19,970
but that's alright. You got a huge bag.

36
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:23,769
Alright, I hope they make a lot of money.

37
00:04:23,769 --> 00:04:31,680
This game is called Garlic Likes. Really?

38
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:46,449
I like that. Rapid fire. Let's go.

39
00:04:46,449 --> 00:04:50,040
Oh fuck, I'm gonna die. I'm dead. I'm not.

40
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,439
Alright, hold on.

41
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:56,709
Energetic friends. Summon attack speed plus 50%. That sounds good.

42
00:04:56,709 --> 00:05:03,149
Oh, I see. And it also unlocks stuff. Dragon egg?

43
00:05:03,149 --> 00:05:24,139
Oh, fuck yeah. This thing hatches into a dragon in three minutes.

44
00:05:24,139 --> 00:05:27,470
Fuck, I'm dead. This game is awesome. Shit.

45
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:30,550
Okay, this game is cool.

46
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:41,589
Okay, let's do it again. Let's do it again. This game is fun.

47
00:05:41,589 --> 00:06:00,000
So, it's two hits. Move speed is essential.

48
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:08,129
It feels like it, yeah, because there's not really any reliable way to get away.

49
00:06:08,129 --> 00:06:10,829
Are there upgrades in this game afterwards? Yes, there is.

50
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:13,259
Oh my God, I love this game.

51
00:06:13,259 --> 00:06:14,459
The other one was good too, but this one feels...

52
00:06:14,459 --> 00:06:16,319
Okay, here's the thing.

53
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,060
The difference between the last game and this one

54
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:22,490
is from the very beginning of that last one that we just played,

55
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:27,490
I felt just powerful. I was so powerful almost already.

56
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:32,100
I was just destroying everything. I just got my ass kicked.

57
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,959
I didn't even make it five minutes.

58
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:37,420
I like that better.

59
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:41,430
I like the game needs to really progress, progress, progress, progress

60
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:45,420
until you get to that point where it's just crazy.

61
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:50,860
It almost gives you an opportunity to learn the game better.

62
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:53,430
Alright, let's see. Reload rate, fire rate, yeah.

63
00:06:53,430 --> 00:07:03,079
Wait, no, let me see everything else.

64
00:07:03,079 --> 00:07:14,939
I think I like this one.

65
00:07:14,939 --> 00:07:17,850
Vampire survivors get a lot more difficult as you progressed.

66
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:23,110
Yeah, I did. I shoot the tree.

67
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:30,209
Oh, all right.

68
00:07:30,209 --> 00:07:39,500
Pick up range is always good. That's a good.

69
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:58,319
Oh, should I just do super reload, Andy?

70
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,620
I do appreciate you can see the ammo on the cursor.

71
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:17,259
That's huge.

72
00:08:17,259 --> 00:08:24,589
I got to collect some shit here, otherwise I'm going to be in trouble.

73
00:08:24,589 --> 00:08:29,050
All right, double shot sounds good with this.

74
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:36,210
Oh, move speed, but didn't you guys say this is important?

75
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:41,860
I probably should do it.

76
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:52,809
I'm already starting to slow down. Yeah, I'll do it.

77
00:08:52,809 --> 00:08:54,009
That's definitely a huge increase.

78
00:08:54,009 --> 00:09:07,139
Yeah, this is much better.

79
00:09:07,139 --> 00:09:11,440
When are you going to unbox an Xbox One?

80
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,519
No, that's actually really funny.

81
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:25,100
I do an Xbox One unboxing video like the Halo edition with faster cheap on it.

82
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,299
Right. That would be actually pretty funny.

83
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:35,210
I'm into that. Wow.

84
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:37,210
Am I going am I going super fast right now?

85
00:09:37,210 --> 00:10:17,419
Oh shit, I want it to be a lot of help.

86
00:10:17,419 --> 00:10:38,639
Oh, is that I like the setup.

87
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:41,750
I like the build.

88
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,850
Oh, all right. I got to get some of that.

89
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:56,080
All right. Time to collect.

90
00:10:56,080 --> 00:11:01,490
It's simple. Yeah, it is simple, but that's a good thing.

91
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:03,860
I think I'm doing double shot.

92
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:18,240
Yeah, a little damage, but I think that's fine.

93
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:24,870
All right. Let's really start to snowball here.

94
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:32,690
HP. Increase bullet damage and move speed by 10 percent every 10 seconds.

95
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:34,700
This resets when you get hit.

96
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,539
Oh my God. That's actually huge.

97
00:11:36,539 --> 00:12:01,450
40 percent. I just don't get hit.

98
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:05,820
There we go. That's what I wanted.

99
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:10,029
Don't get greedy. I got greedy.

100
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:12,330
Your dragon gains 8 damage every 60 seconds.

101
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:15,649
This ability works even if your dragon is still in the egg.

102
00:12:15,649 --> 00:12:23,049
Egg salad. Increase reload rate by 5 percent for every enemy killed.

103
00:12:23,049 --> 00:12:28,059
That's okay. That's kind of cool.

104
00:12:28,059 --> 00:12:29,950
That's kind of cool.

105
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:33,299
Should I just I think I'm going to go for the dragon.

106
00:12:33,299 --> 00:12:35,370
It's going to stay alive.

107
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:50,799
Oh shit, I'm going to die.

108
00:12:50,799 --> 00:13:20,159
I got to focus. No more talking.

109
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:21,360
What the fuck is that?

110
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:30,509
All right. Holy shield. Health.

111
00:13:30,509 --> 00:13:41,149
I think I need this. I got one health.

112
00:13:41,149 --> 00:13:53,450
Ooh. Enemies within your vision range take 25 damage every two seconds.

113
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:59,799
I got to stay alive though.

114
00:13:59,799 --> 00:14:02,399
Re-halo pieces can now appear as upgrade choices.

115
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:07,019
Collect all three to recover Shauna's halo.

116
00:14:07,019 --> 00:14:10,679
Okay. Is something else in there?

117
00:14:10,679 --> 00:14:11,779
Oh my God.

118
00:14:11,779 --> 00:14:13,679
Okay. That was... I died.

119
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:20,730
Shit. All right. That was fun.

120
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:33,470
Let's go. Get the upgrades of the main menu.

121
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:42,029
I'll do one more and then we'll go there.

122
00:14:42,029 --> 00:14:44,980
Fuck. I really like this.

123
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:46,080
When did this come out?

124
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:57,169
A couple months ago?

125
00:14:57,169 --> 00:15:04,340
Why did it take me so long to understand that it existed?

126
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:07,440
I got 20 in the recommended Discord channel.

127
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,190
20 play Freddy fish 3.

128
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:17,080
Oh no. No play this one?

129
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,580
I think we're going electro.

130
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:23,330
Let's try it. Every second shot.

131
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:37,279
That's awesome.

132
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:38,980
All right. Magic lens.

133
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,940
Quick hands.

134
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,639
Let's go with the health right off the bat.

135
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:47,940
This is the one. This is the run.

136
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:53,700
We're going to get to at least 15 minutes or 10 minutes.

137
00:15:53,799 --> 00:16:03,779
I need some rapid fire though so the lightning happens more often.

138
00:16:03,779 --> 00:16:22,159
Dumb ass.

139
00:16:22,159 --> 00:16:24,769
All right. Give me something good.

140
00:16:24,769 --> 00:16:28,070
Max HP plus 2. Character size plus 50%.

141
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:31,759
I don't know if I like that.

142
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:35,159
Ooh. Egg. No.

143
00:16:35,159 --> 00:16:42,039
I want lightning.

144
00:16:42,039 --> 00:16:43,039
Okay. When lightning strikes an enemy,

145
00:16:43,039 --> 00:16:45,340
there's a 20% chance to automatically refill three ammo.

146
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:52,139
Let's do it.

147
00:16:52,139 --> 00:16:57,419
I wonder how often that's going to happen.

148
00:16:57,419 --> 00:17:01,039
Hasn't happened yet.

149
00:17:01,039 --> 00:17:20,940
There we go. It's pretty good.

150
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:24,700
That's good, but I need reload speed.

151
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:30,930
Summon an electro bug that calls down lightning to strike two nearby enemies.

152
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:38,940
Rapid fire or electro bug? Let's do it.

153
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:40,839
That's good that it just passively does that.

154
00:17:40,839 --> 00:18:01,319
Ooh. Power shot. Nice.

155
00:18:01,319 --> 00:18:04,109
All lightning damage increased by 12.

156
00:18:04,109 --> 00:18:06,410
Increased lightning area effect by 75%.

157
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:09,000
Yeah. Lightning build.

158
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:14,779
Let's do it.

159
00:18:14,779 --> 00:18:31,970
Now I need rapid fire and more ammo.

160
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:32,670
Double shot.

161
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:36,930
Ooh. Yep.

162
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:38,630
Does that count as two?

163
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:42,299
It does, right?

164
00:18:42,299 --> 00:18:58,950
Oh, it doesn't count as two.

165
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:02,430
I think it's that one.

166
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:04,140
Yeah. I need the movement speed.

167
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:22,630
Plus the fire rate.

168
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:25,849
Thank you.

169
00:19:25,849 --> 00:19:29,170
Three halo pieces can now appear.

170
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:31,259
Take it.

171
00:19:31,259 --> 00:19:33,440
Dude, what the fuck just happened?

172
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,740
That's got bounced around like crazy.

173
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,140
Bullet speed.

174
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:40,819
Fire rate. That's what I want.

175
00:19:40,819 --> 00:19:46,119
Oh, yeah.

176
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:48,420
All right. As long as I don't act like a bonehead,

177
00:19:48,420 --> 00:20:09,960
I should be fine here.

178
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:14,759
Ooh. Ooh.

179
00:20:14,759 --> 00:20:17,849
Does this count?

180
00:20:17,849 --> 00:20:22,150
It's not fun when Jerma is not being stupid.

181
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:26,119
Man, we're just sometimes just chilling, dude.

182
00:20:26,119 --> 00:20:29,920
Dude, if you step on the gas and you go 100 miles per hour the whole time,

183
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:35,009
you're going to run out of gas and the car is going to break down.

184
00:20:35,009 --> 00:20:35,809
You got your car.

185
00:20:35,809 --> 00:20:42,880
You need to refuel sometimes.

186
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,279
Magnet's good.

187
00:20:45,279 --> 00:21:05,960
Yeah. It's a good choice.

188
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:17,710
Yeah. You don't want the car to run out of gas.

189
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:19,410
How many times have you said gas today?

190
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:22,960
At least 10.

191
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,259
All right. I want that.

192
00:21:24,259 --> 00:21:42,279
Or what is the is the vision rain this big circle around me?

193
00:21:42,279 --> 00:21:44,460
Were you ever come to Pittsburgh?

194
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:46,359
Dude, I was there yesterday.

195
00:21:46,359 --> 00:21:47,259
I was there yesterday.

196
00:21:47,259 --> 00:21:48,759
I got a fucking steak of cheese.

197
00:21:48,759 --> 00:21:55,500
I got a Philly cheesesteak.

198
00:21:55,500 --> 00:22:10,809
You missed me by like four hours.

199
00:22:10,809 --> 00:22:12,930
Wrong city.

200
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:16,829
Well, you don't think that they have cheap like famous cheese steaks

201
00:22:16,829 --> 00:22:20,480
in any other cities in that state?

202
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:26,000
Well, you think it's only exclusive to Philly?

203
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,200
They do, but they suck.

204
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:34,539
What?

205
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:47,759
Are we this one?

206
00:22:47,759 --> 00:22:52,990
You called it a Philly cheesesteak.

207
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:55,190
If I order a New York style pizza,

208
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:58,460
the person behind the counter is not going to go.

209
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:04,519
Hey, you know, this is Buffalo.

210
00:23:04,519 --> 00:23:05,619
Oh, no, no, no. Sorry.

211
00:23:05,619 --> 00:23:09,579
Hey, you know, you know, you're in Cincinnati, dude.

212
00:23:09,579 --> 00:23:10,980
If it's in New York style pizza,

213
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:13,329
New York City style pizza.

214
00:23:13,329 --> 00:23:14,430
You're an idiot.

215
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:15,730
You don't even know what city you're in.

216
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:25,000
I just fucking lost because of that.

217
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:33,539
Oh, my eye.

218
00:23:33,539 --> 00:23:35,039
That was such a good run too.

219
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:47,380
Man that person for seven days.

220
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:48,980
Philly cheese rant.

221
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:50,980
Yeah, if you make a Philly cheese, dude,

222
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:53,279
you can't just be like, oh, hey.

223
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:54,279
Oh, hey, grandpa.

224
00:23:54,279 --> 00:23:54,779
How are you?

225
00:23:54,779 --> 00:23:56,180
I'm doing very good.

226
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:56,680
Oh, man.

227
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:59,980
Hey, are you going to make me your famous Philly cheesesteak?

228
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,779
Yes, I'm going to make you a Philly cheesesteak.

229
00:24:01,779 --> 00:24:04,150
I know how to make it really good.

230
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:06,670
Did you even grow up in Philadelphia?

231
00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:07,470
No, I didn't.

232
00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:09,869
I just know how to make them really good.

233
00:24:09,869 --> 00:24:11,670
And I have family there.

234
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:14,519
Did you grow up in Philly?

235
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:15,420
No, I'm sorry.

236
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:16,319
I didn't mean to.

237
00:24:16,319 --> 00:24:17,119
Is it Otto?

238
00:24:17,119 --> 00:24:23,839
No, it's not.

239
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:31,930
Cheese steak gatekeeping.

240
00:24:32,029 --> 00:24:57,000
All right, I want to do something cool like this.

241
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,640
I got a famous salmon I'd like to make.

242
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:03,960
I got a famous egg salad I want to make for you.

243
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:10,430
What was even your eggs?

244
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:28,559
I'm sorry.

245
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:36,059
All right, I'm going to pay attention.

246
00:25:36,059 --> 00:25:38,880
Remember, that's disgusting.

247
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:43,660
Well, that's kind of something.

248
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:49,289
Ooh, I like that.

249
00:25:49,289 --> 00:26:14,859
But this synergizes better.

250
00:26:14,859 --> 00:26:15,960
All right, more, more, more.

251
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,240
Should I go for the egg?

252
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:19,079
All right, I'm actually going to go for the egg

253
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:54,440
and not be a moron.

254
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:56,720
We're good?

255
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:00,200
All right, I think I can comfortably.

256
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:12,539
Yeah, that one.

257
00:27:12,539 --> 00:27:25,900
Whoa, tree.

258
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:27,099
Damage 35%.

259
00:27:27,099 --> 00:27:29,769
Yep, we're going straight up.

260
00:27:29,769 --> 00:27:59,880
Just bullet damage.

261
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:00,779
Bullet bounce?

262
00:28:00,779 --> 00:28:05,599
All right, I got to think about going somewhere else.

263
00:28:05,599 --> 00:28:07,799
So it will bounce off of people.

264
00:28:07,799 --> 00:28:11,759
Hey, I've been performing some rituals on you

265
00:28:11,759 --> 00:28:13,460
and just wanted to know if you still had 10 toes.

266
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:16,640
Yes, I do.

267
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:20,539
Please do a ritual where I have a healthy life and shit.

268
00:28:20,539 --> 00:28:25,049
Come on, do some rituals where I learn

269
00:28:25,049 --> 00:28:27,549
how to figure your skate or ice skate or something.

270
00:28:27,549 --> 00:28:28,349
Something interesting.

271
00:28:28,349 --> 00:28:30,200
Let me do something cool.

272
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,000
Stop removing toes and shit.

273
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,500
Stop.

274
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,700
Next time you're at the altar or whatever it is,

275
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:39,359
just be like, you know what?

276
00:28:39,359 --> 00:28:40,759
Let's make something cool.

277
00:28:40,759 --> 00:28:41,859
Let's do something.

278
00:28:41,859 --> 00:28:45,980
Maybe he eats a really good piece of pizza tomorrow or something.

279
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:48,750
Come on.

280
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:50,349
Enough of this bullshit.

281
00:28:50,349 --> 00:29:04,079
Enough of the bullshit.

282
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:08,470
Don't go over there.

283
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:10,329
Gun mastery.

284
00:29:10,329 --> 00:29:13,160
Wait, did I just?

285
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:15,619
All right, yeah.

286
00:29:15,619 --> 00:29:20,329
That sounds pretty amazing.

287
00:29:20,329 --> 00:29:31,130
This is actually the run, so I'm not going to blow it.

288
00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:31,930
Quick learner.

289
00:29:31,930 --> 00:29:33,829
Increase experience gain by 40%.

290
00:29:33,829 --> 00:29:35,380
Yep.

291
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:36,880
OK, that's where.

292
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:41,150
All right.

293
00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:43,150
Really?

294
00:29:43,150 --> 00:30:00,430
Oh, the dragon's coming out soon, right?

295
00:30:00,529 --> 00:30:05,130
That experience thing is insane.

296
00:30:05,130 --> 00:30:06,430
Reload rate, 5%.

297
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:11,980
Bullet damage by 50% for one second after reloading.

298
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:14,720
Reload rate by 5% for every enemy killed.

299
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,019
This resets after reloading.

300
00:30:16,019 --> 00:30:18,319
No, we'll do this one.

301
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:37,380
Yeah.

302
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:38,759
Yep.

303
00:30:38,759 --> 00:30:40,119
OK.

304
00:30:40,119 --> 00:30:41,119
Dragon.

305
00:30:41,119 --> 00:30:42,420
Bullet speed.

306
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:44,720
Ghost friend.

307
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:48,849
Dragon bond.

308
00:30:48,849 --> 00:30:51,099
This one.

309
00:30:51,099 --> 00:31:05,279
Dragon does more damage, even when he's in the egg.

310
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:15,450
Did he actually kill the trees, or is that just a waste of time?

311
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:27,250
Jesus.

312
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:28,049
Whoa.

313
00:31:28,049 --> 00:31:34,509
OK, all right, all right, all right, all right.

314
00:31:34,509 --> 00:31:38,230
Damage 45% and huge size.

315
00:31:38,329 --> 00:31:42,059
Yes.

316
00:31:42,059 --> 00:31:42,559
Fuck.

317
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:48,349
All right, this is getting hard.

318
00:31:48,349 --> 00:31:51,039
I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.

319
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:56,799
Choose an upgrade.

320
00:31:56,799 --> 00:31:59,549
Bullet damage minus 50%.

321
00:31:59,549 --> 00:32:02,549
But burn, lightning, and freeze duration by 30%.

322
00:32:02,549 --> 00:32:03,849
I don't have any of that.

323
00:32:03,849 --> 00:32:05,349
Summon damage by 50%.

324
00:32:05,349 --> 00:32:09,220
Summon attack speed, but my reload rate is awful.

325
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:10,720
Forward bullet damage, bullet su-

326
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,690
Yeah, it's got to be this one, right?

327
00:32:12,690 --> 00:32:13,390
Max HP.

328
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:20,579
Is that going to kill me?

329
00:32:20,579 --> 00:32:21,480
This one will kill me?

330
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:29,829
I think that was the right call.

331
00:32:29,829 --> 00:32:40,269
This is ridiculous.

332
00:32:40,269 --> 00:32:43,779
Is the area getting smaller?

333
00:32:43,779 --> 00:32:52,740
I'm not getting fortnighted, am I?

334
00:32:52,740 --> 00:33:01,400
Definitely this one.

335
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,299
What is causing that?

336
00:33:02,299 --> 00:33:20,660
Can I stop it?

337
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:37,250
I'm really glad their enemy projectiles are red.

338
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:40,390
Movement speed.

339
00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:48,140
Uh, I don't know.

340
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:49,769
Probably this one.

341
00:33:49,769 --> 00:34:00,250
Just more, more piercing with damage.

342
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:29,179
Oh, that was close.

343
00:34:29,179 --> 00:34:41,320
No.

344
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:45,250
I think I need to take it.

345
00:34:45,250 --> 00:35:05,650
I do.

346
00:35:05,650 --> 00:35:07,550
I got so much shit over there to go pick up.

347
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:21,000
Let's run them over here.

348
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:33,340
All right, pick up.

349
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:36,659
Enemies explode into three bullets when killed.

350
00:35:36,659 --> 00:35:44,579
Huge.

351
00:35:44,579 --> 00:35:45,780
That's good too, though.

352
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:49,179
I'm going to do this.

353
00:35:49,179 --> 00:35:55,369
They explode when killed and does 10% damage.

354
00:35:55,369 --> 00:35:56,969
Holy shit, that's unbelievable.

355
00:35:56,969 --> 00:36:10,030
All right, just don't blow it.

356
00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:18,480
There's so many bullets everywhere.

357
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:19,980
So I got a question.

358
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:23,389
Does this include...

359
00:36:23,389 --> 00:36:25,940
Way too dank?

360
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:34,760
Uh, does that count for the little bullets that are coming out from the explosion?

361
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:35,940
It does?

362
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:38,219
Okay, that sounds kind of crazy.

363
00:36:38,219 --> 00:36:52,909
Uh, yeah.

364
00:36:52,909 --> 00:36:55,719
Jesus.

365
00:36:55,719 --> 00:36:59,579
When shooting your last ammo, also shoot 10 bullets in a circle.

366
00:36:59,579 --> 00:37:23,409
Oh, hell yeah.

367
00:37:23,409 --> 00:37:26,670
Oh my god.

368
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:31,739
Okay.

369
00:37:31,739 --> 00:37:35,610
This one's probably good too, now.

370
00:37:35,610 --> 00:37:36,610
Yeah, 25 damage.

371
00:37:36,610 --> 00:37:40,739
All enemies within your vision range take 25 damage every two seconds.

372
00:37:40,739 --> 00:37:41,539
Or take the shield.

373
00:37:43,639 --> 00:38:02,610
That's probably a good idea.

374
00:38:02,610 --> 00:38:03,110
All right.

375
00:38:03,110 --> 00:38:04,010
It's getting kind of crazy here.

376
00:38:04,010 --> 00:38:08,010
Bullet speed plus 30%.

377
00:38:08,010 --> 00:38:09,110
I'm going to do the moving speed.

378
00:38:09,110 --> 00:38:09,909
I feel like I need it.

379
00:38:09,909 --> 00:38:29,269
So many experience gems everywhere.

380
00:38:29,269 --> 00:38:51,150
Pick up range.

381
00:38:51,150 --> 00:38:53,579
Bullet speed.

382
00:38:53,579 --> 00:38:56,579
Increase reload rate and move speed by 25% while Holy Shield is active.

383
00:38:56,579 --> 00:39:01,320
Um, yeah.

384
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:10,570
Wow.

385
00:39:10,570 --> 00:39:12,050
All right, this is definitely the one.

386
00:39:12,050 --> 00:39:24,800
Feels like I get killed by a boss or something.

387
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:28,460
On every fifth shot, launch a fireball that deals 40 damage.

388
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:32,900
Burn as well.

389
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:35,519
I think I'm going to do maybe speed.

390
00:39:35,519 --> 00:39:36,219
All right, I'll do the fire.

391
00:39:36,219 --> 00:39:37,219
Yeah, this one.

392
00:39:37,219 --> 00:39:47,070
All right, that's a new enemy.

393
00:39:47,070 --> 00:40:06,849
Shit.

394
00:40:06,949 --> 00:40:13,210
Oh, but it's so bad.

395
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:22,769
I think it's this one.

396
00:40:22,769 --> 00:40:25,849
Why is it happening twice?

397
00:40:25,849 --> 00:40:26,750
Why is it happening twice?

398
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:29,730
That shouldn't be happening twice.

399
00:40:29,730 --> 00:40:52,050
Am I just getting really lucky or something?

400
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:53,050
Oh, yes.

401
00:40:53,050 --> 00:41:42,909
Let's go.

402
00:41:42,909 --> 00:41:43,809
Walk speed.

403
00:41:43,809 --> 00:41:46,920
Uh, ghost friend.

404
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:49,420
Pick up range.

405
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:49,619
Go.

406
00:41:49,619 --> 00:42:01,360
All right, I'll do ghost friend.

407
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:01,559
All right.

408
00:42:01,559 --> 00:42:07,300
Whatever that is, I got to be careful.

409
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:41,929
My ears are itching.

410
00:42:41,929 --> 00:42:43,030
Ah, all right.

411
00:42:43,030 --> 00:42:44,360
What is it?

412
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:46,659
Triple the effect of the next upgrade you take.

413
00:42:46,659 --> 00:42:47,460
Oh my God.

414
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:47,760
All right.

415
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:53,079
What is it?

416
00:42:53,079 --> 00:42:55,960
I mean, wait.

417
00:42:55,960 --> 00:43:01,050
That'll, I'll die.

418
00:43:01,050 --> 00:43:06,820
Minus three that I'll, it'll kill me.

419
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:08,820
300% walk speed though.

420
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:25,980
That would be crazy.

421
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:28,750
That's your speed while shooting.

422
00:43:28,750 --> 00:43:30,349
I mean, that's still amazing.

423
00:43:30,349 --> 00:43:34,679
I could reroll it.

424
00:43:34,679 --> 00:43:43,840
Should I try to reroll it?

425
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:46,980
So this will shoot three bullets behind me.

426
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:50,090
Wait.

427
00:43:50,090 --> 00:43:50,789
So hold on a minute.

428
00:43:50,789 --> 00:44:00,260
This will shoot three bullets behind me every time I click.

429
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:02,639
It sucks.

430
00:44:02,639 --> 00:44:09,789
I'm doing it.

431
00:44:09,789 --> 00:44:10,989
How come it's not shooting three?

432
00:44:10,989 --> 00:44:19,019
Didn't say it triples the effect.

433
00:44:19,019 --> 00:44:22,070
Oh, I got scammed.

434
00:44:22,070 --> 00:44:24,659
Oh, well, I got seven minutes.

435
00:44:24,659 --> 00:44:25,159
I'm fine.

436
00:44:25,159 --> 00:44:30,230
It's three stacked together.

437
00:44:30,230 --> 00:44:31,550
Is it?

438
00:44:31,550 --> 00:44:32,650
I think it actually might be.

439
00:44:32,650 --> 00:44:33,250
Yeah, no, it is.

440
00:44:33,250 --> 00:44:33,849
It is.

441
00:44:33,849 --> 00:44:34,449
It definitely is.

442
00:44:34,949 --> 00:44:36,260
See what it's doing.

443
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:37,460
Yeah, it is three.

444
00:44:37,460 --> 00:44:38,460
No, we didn't get scammed.

445
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:42,530
We're good.

446
00:44:42,530 --> 00:45:13,389
Yeah, it's definitely three.

447
00:45:13,389 --> 00:45:17,650
Maybe it's time for lightning.

448
00:45:17,650 --> 00:45:57,230
I'm shooting a lot of bullets.

449
00:45:57,230 --> 00:46:01,300
Okay, so but is that really that good?

450
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:11,010
So max HP, it'll take away one of the empty ones.

451
00:46:11,010 --> 00:46:13,500
So that's just a free plus 10 more damage.

452
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:23,320
Okay, I'm doing it.

453
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:26,360
I can already tell the difference.

454
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:52,809
Worth it.

455
00:46:52,809 --> 00:46:53,210
Five minutes.

456
00:46:53,210 --> 00:47:09,440
We're almost there.

457
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:11,989
Is that zero?

458
00:47:11,989 --> 00:47:14,289
Reload rate, bullet damage crazy, but max ammo.

459
00:47:14,289 --> 00:47:22,550
Wouldn't that make my max ammo zero?

460
00:47:22,550 --> 00:47:26,119
I would have one ammo.

461
00:47:26,219 --> 00:47:28,650
No, no way.

462
00:47:28,650 --> 00:47:33,500
You will spin so much though.

463
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:35,179
I go for it.

464
00:47:35,179 --> 00:47:35,380
All right.

465
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:47,789
I'm going to go for it.

466
00:47:47,789 --> 00:47:47,989
All right.

467
00:47:47,989 --> 00:47:52,630
Turns out it was worth it.

468
00:47:52,630 --> 00:47:57,250
Oh shit.

469
00:47:57,250 --> 00:48:19,360
I just got hit by what?

470
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:27,320
Actually not great for right now because I can't aim.

471
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:54,199
I would love to aim at these guys.

472
00:48:54,199 --> 00:49:09,239
Shit.

473
00:49:09,239 --> 00:49:10,340
I was so close.

474
00:49:10,340 --> 00:49:14,139
I think that kind of screwed me because I couldn't aim at.

475
00:49:14,139 --> 00:49:16,940
I couldn't aim at the individual people shooting the eyeball.

476
00:49:16,940 --> 00:49:18,800
The bullets.

477
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:19,199
Damn it.

478
00:49:19,199 --> 00:49:21,329
It's all right.

479
00:49:21,329 --> 00:49:24,409
Wait, is this stuff shotgun?

480
00:49:24,409 --> 00:49:25,510
Oh, this is awesome.

481
00:49:25,510 --> 00:49:26,010
Really?

482
00:49:26,010 --> 00:49:34,139
There's so much to do.

483
00:49:34,139 --> 00:49:44,550
I'm going to turn this down.

484
00:49:44,550 --> 00:49:45,250
Okay.

485
00:49:45,250 --> 00:49:53,260
Um, who should I unlock?

486
00:49:53,260 --> 00:49:56,159
On every third shot throw out a wave of fire that burns enemies.

487
00:49:56,159 --> 00:49:58,099
That's kind of cool.

488
00:49:58,099 --> 00:50:02,809
Starts with more HP.

489
00:50:02,809 --> 00:50:12,409
Right click to summon a shadow clone.

490
00:50:12,409 --> 00:50:17,980
Starts with lightning.

491
00:50:17,980 --> 00:50:21,309
That's pretty good.

492
00:50:21,309 --> 00:50:24,909
Right click to quickly shoot all of your remaining ammo in random directions.

493
00:50:24,909 --> 00:50:27,920
That's kind of cool too.

494
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:31,010
Is there more?

495
00:50:31,010 --> 00:50:34,650
There's more.

496
00:50:34,650 --> 00:50:34,849
All right.

497
00:50:34,849 --> 00:50:37,679
I'm going to.

498
00:50:37,679 --> 00:50:37,980
All right.

499
00:50:37,980 --> 00:50:39,780
We're going to we're going to save our money for a second here.

500
00:50:39,780 --> 00:50:41,079
Let's do the one.

501
00:50:41,079 --> 00:50:41,679
All right.

502
00:50:41,679 --> 00:50:42,480
More HP.

503
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:44,780
Let's do this one.

504
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:47,599
And shotgun.

505
00:50:47,599 --> 00:50:50,500
I love shotguns.

506
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:52,000
I like that crossbow.

507
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:58,079
That's kind of cool.

508
00:50:58,079 --> 00:51:01,840
Ooh, I like that too.

509
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:02,139
All right.

510
00:51:02,139 --> 00:51:05,849
I'm going to go with shotgun.

511
00:51:05,849 --> 00:51:10,670
Wait a minute.

512
00:51:10,670 --> 00:51:17,230
Oh sword or shield.

513
00:51:17,230 --> 00:51:18,829
Do I have to go in order?

514
00:51:18,829 --> 00:51:19,230
Oh, okay.

515
00:51:19,230 --> 00:51:22,449
Rank one.

516
00:51:22,449 --> 00:51:33,329
I think I'm going to go with this pickup range is huge.

517
00:51:33,329 --> 00:51:38,869
That's 3 6 9 12.

518
00:51:38,869 --> 00:51:39,070
All right.

519
00:51:39,070 --> 00:51:40,570
That's 15% pickup range.

520
00:51:40,570 --> 00:51:48,849
I think I'm cool with that bullet damage and summon damage.

521
00:51:48,849 --> 00:51:53,429
I mean just do more damage, right?

522
00:51:53,429 --> 00:51:57,570
I think this this is the one to do.

523
00:51:57,570 --> 00:51:57,869
Yeah.

524
00:51:57,869 --> 00:51:58,170
Okay.

525
00:51:58,170 --> 00:52:00,699
All right.

526
00:52:00,699 --> 00:52:01,199
Let's go for it.

527
00:52:01,199 --> 00:52:02,300
I got the shotgun.

528
00:52:02,300 --> 00:52:07,420
I got a diamond.

529
00:52:07,420 --> 00:52:07,719
All right.

530
00:52:07,719 --> 00:52:12,019
This is the one.

531
00:52:12,019 --> 00:52:13,219
You didn't have to stop aiming.

532
00:52:13,219 --> 00:52:15,099
Well, the problem is I only had one shot.

533
00:52:15,099 --> 00:52:16,849
And if I...

534
00:52:16,849 --> 00:52:32,329
What do bullets do I have?

535
00:52:32,329 --> 00:52:34,170
Okay.

536
00:52:34,170 --> 00:52:38,199
A fire rate bullet damage.

537
00:52:38,199 --> 00:52:40,000
I'm going to do damage and knock back with the shotgun.

538
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:44,639
That seems like a good idea.

539
00:52:44,639 --> 00:52:55,719
Face is itchy.

540
00:52:55,719 --> 00:53:06,920
Stop.

541
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:08,590
I kind of want this.

542
00:53:08,590 --> 00:53:14,760
Enemies in your vision take 25 damage every two seconds.

543
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:19,110
Now the vision is what circle?

544
00:53:19,110 --> 00:53:21,889
Oh, it's the little circle.

545
00:53:21,889 --> 00:53:22,289
Okay.

546
00:53:22,289 --> 00:53:24,579
I'm not happy about that, but whatever.

547
00:53:24,579 --> 00:53:27,469
That's okay.

548
00:53:27,469 --> 00:53:45,039
I thought it was the big circle.

549
00:53:45,039 --> 00:53:46,039
I mean, it's a shotgun.

550
00:53:46,039 --> 00:54:05,900
So might as well.

551
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:12,420
Actually, the vision thing is actually doing pretty good.

552
00:54:12,420 --> 00:54:13,019
This is a little bit more.

553
00:54:13,019 --> 00:54:29,869
It's more damage than the shotgun is doing.

554
00:54:29,869 --> 00:54:45,579
Rapid fire shotgun.

555
00:54:45,579 --> 00:54:45,780
All right.

556
00:54:45,780 --> 00:54:47,760
What should I get for food today?

557
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:49,380
What do you guys think?

558
00:54:49,380 --> 00:54:51,079
Somebody said Taco Bell.

559
00:54:51,079 --> 00:54:56,559
They were going to get it, but I kind of screwed that up for them.

560
00:54:56,559 --> 00:54:58,550
Oh, yeah.

561
00:54:58,550 --> 00:55:01,670
Double shotgun blast.

562
00:55:01,670 --> 00:55:03,760
Is it actually firing double?

563
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:08,130
I can't tell.

564
00:55:08,130 --> 00:55:15,940
Is it?

565
00:55:15,940 --> 00:55:19,820
It's just plus one.

566
00:55:19,820 --> 00:55:21,820
Oh, it's the fifth projectile.

567
00:55:21,820 --> 00:55:40,400
Okay.

568
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:44,610
Movement speed.

569
00:55:44,610 --> 00:55:59,579
Good to get it early.

570
00:55:59,579 --> 00:56:00,679
Vision range plus 15.

571
00:56:00,679 --> 00:56:06,210
The damage from glare also applies the on-hit effects on your bullets.

572
00:56:06,210 --> 00:56:07,110
Oh, okay.

573
00:56:07,110 --> 00:56:11,590
So I have to get burn or freeze or something, right?

574
00:56:11,590 --> 00:56:14,559
Oh, come on, dude.

575
00:56:14,559 --> 00:56:14,960
Stop.

576
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:17,219
What am I doing?

577
00:56:17,219 --> 00:56:38,360
I'm blowing it.

578
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:39,940
What do you got?

579
00:56:39,940 --> 00:56:45,030
Raise bullet damage and bullet size by 15% permanently every time you heal.

580
00:56:45,030 --> 00:56:47,809
Whoa.

581
00:56:47,809 --> 00:57:05,869
I'm about to get hit.

582
00:57:05,869 --> 00:57:09,260
So I have to start healing.

583
00:57:09,260 --> 00:57:10,260
How do you heal though?

584
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:11,360
Reliably.

585
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:13,159
All I see is max HP.

586
00:57:13,159 --> 00:57:15,980
I haven't seen heal HP yet.

587
00:57:15,980 --> 00:57:17,380
Is it my doing something wrong?

588
00:57:17,380 --> 00:57:23,000
Not healing somehow.

589
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:29,690
Fire path heals.

590
00:57:29,690 --> 00:57:30,889
Fire and HP.

591
00:57:30,889 --> 00:57:31,690
HP plus.

592
00:57:31,690 --> 00:57:37,329
Okay.

593
00:57:37,329 --> 00:57:39,679
Twice as much glare.

594
00:57:39,679 --> 00:57:45,420
I'll do freeze because I need it.

595
00:57:45,420 --> 00:58:10,829
Because glare will inflict freeze, right?

596
00:58:10,829 --> 00:58:40,739
Very helpful.

597
00:58:40,739 --> 00:58:45,619
This one?

598
00:58:45,619 --> 00:58:47,820
You can get a healing fruit if you kill a tree.

599
00:58:47,820 --> 00:58:50,730
Oh.

600
00:58:50,730 --> 00:59:15,670
Good to know.

601
00:59:15,670 --> 00:59:24,440
Does the eye have to be open for it to take damage?

602
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:32,559
Jeez.

603
00:59:32,559 --> 00:59:36,360
Only talks to us when he needs us.

604
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:37,860
Well, I'm focusing.

605
00:59:37,860 --> 00:59:43,599
I have to pay attention.

606
00:59:43,599 --> 00:59:48,679
Probably going to do this.

607
00:59:48,679 --> 01:00:23,710
Or should I do ghost?

608
01:00:23,710 --> 01:00:24,409
Stop.

609
01:00:24,409 --> 01:00:26,110
The freeze made me run into you.

610
01:00:26,110 --> 01:00:34,150
Shit.

611
01:00:34,150 --> 01:00:34,750
All right.

612
01:00:34,750 --> 01:00:45,250
I'm losing it here.

613
01:00:45,250 --> 01:00:50,039
Okay, there we go.

614
01:00:50,039 --> 01:00:55,179
I mean, that's probably the one to do.

615
01:00:55,179 --> 01:01:03,289
Yeah.

616
01:01:03,289 --> 01:01:05,329
Reload rate.

617
01:01:05,329 --> 01:01:07,369
Max ammo is big.

618
01:01:07,369 --> 01:01:10,539
I can shoot three times, right?

619
01:01:10,539 --> 01:01:21,050
Yep.

620
01:01:21,050 --> 01:01:21,849
Oh my god.

621
01:01:21,849 --> 01:01:22,949
I'm absolutely blowing it.

622
01:01:22,949 --> 01:01:26,139
I'm moving so fast.

623
01:01:26,139 --> 01:01:27,440
The movement speed made me run it.

624
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:29,539
I don't know if I want the movement speed.

625
01:01:29,539 --> 01:01:33,099
It's too fast.

626
01:01:33,099 --> 01:01:34,300
I wasn't prepared for it.

627
01:01:34,300 --> 01:01:40,719
I just ran into that person twice.

628
01:01:40,719 --> 01:01:41,019
All right.

629
01:01:41,019 --> 01:02:14,539
I'll pull it together.

630
01:02:14,539 --> 01:02:41,539
Die.

631
01:02:41,539 --> 01:02:42,639
Have to take a healing thing?

632
01:02:42,639 --> 01:02:43,239
I know.

633
01:02:43,239 --> 01:02:55,719
It's this one.

634
01:02:55,719 --> 01:02:57,219
I got to kill one of these trees.

635
01:02:57,219 --> 01:03:14,639
I thought he was dead.

636
01:03:14,639 --> 01:03:40,460
That was almost death.

637
01:03:40,460 --> 01:03:45,530
This one?

638
01:03:45,630 --> 01:03:50,289
I think so.

639
01:03:50,289 --> 01:03:51,489
Trees have so much health.

640
01:03:51,489 --> 01:03:56,409
Should I not even be trying?

641
01:03:56,409 --> 01:03:57,409
I'm definitely in trouble though.

642
01:03:57,409 --> 01:04:34,820
I'm not doing enough damage.

643
01:04:34,820 --> 01:04:35,019
All right.

644
01:04:35,019 --> 01:04:47,400
Give me a level.

645
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:48,199
All right.

646
01:04:48,199 --> 01:04:57,010
Health?

647
01:04:57,010 --> 01:04:57,510
Shield?

648
01:04:57,510 --> 01:04:58,010
Probably.

649
01:04:58,010 --> 01:04:58,510
I mean, it's got to be.

650
01:04:58,510 --> 01:05:05,679
It has to be the shield because if I take a hit or curse,

651
01:05:05,679 --> 01:05:06,280
that's just crit.

652
01:05:06,280 --> 01:05:09,460
I'll do it.

653
01:05:09,460 --> 01:05:37,940
I'm in so much trouble though.

654
01:05:37,940 --> 01:05:41,449
Oh, glare and curse work together really well.

655
01:05:41,449 --> 01:05:41,750
All right.

656
01:05:41,750 --> 01:05:56,329
I see what you mean.

657
01:05:56,329 --> 01:05:59,429
I have to take it.

658
01:05:59,429 --> 01:06:00,130
I have to.

659
01:06:00,130 --> 01:06:36,920
Because don't I get a bonus for that?

660
01:06:36,920 --> 01:06:40,219
Just try to level up glare the whole way.

661
01:06:40,219 --> 01:06:53,090
It's the only thing that's keeping me alive.

662
01:06:53,090 --> 01:06:57,329
I think I'm going to get overwhelmed when it's all these sucker

663
01:06:57,329 --> 01:06:57,829
things.

664
01:06:57,829 --> 01:07:27,030
That's back.

665
01:07:27,030 --> 01:07:51,000
I don't like any of these.

666
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:54,179
I don't like any of these but splinter is probably the best one.

667
01:07:54,179 --> 01:08:14,079
Oh, I'm in trouble.

668
01:08:14,079 --> 01:08:34,529
Oh, shit.

669
01:08:34,529 --> 01:08:35,029
This thing.

670
01:08:35,029 --> 01:09:27,979
I need a level.

671
01:09:27,979 --> 01:09:45,029
Come on.

672
01:09:45,029 --> 01:09:57,699
Shoot.

673
01:09:57,699 --> 01:10:29,109
Dead.

674
01:10:29,109 --> 01:10:30,109
There's nothing I could do.

675
01:10:30,109 --> 01:10:31,600
I was so screwed.

676
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:32,899
I just couldn't kill anything.

677
01:10:32,899 --> 01:10:34,039
Shit.

678
01:10:34,039 --> 01:10:34,640
All right.

679
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:35,739
I'm going to do that one.

680
01:10:35,739 --> 01:10:36,239
One more.

681
01:10:36,239 --> 01:10:38,449
One more.

682
01:10:38,449 --> 01:10:38,949
One more.

683
01:10:38,949 --> 01:10:39,449
One more.

684
01:10:39,449 --> 01:10:39,949
One more.

685
01:10:39,949 --> 01:10:40,449
One more.

686
01:10:40,449 --> 01:10:40,949
One more.

687
01:10:40,949 --> 01:10:42,649
One more.

688
01:10:42,649 --> 01:10:44,270
One more.

689
01:10:44,270 --> 01:10:44,869
Character is good.

690
01:10:44,869 --> 01:10:47,460
I'm going to try this.

691
01:10:47,460 --> 01:10:50,770
I'm going to try the crossbow.

692
01:10:50,770 --> 01:10:57,409
All the damage.

693
01:10:57,909 --> 01:11:02,109
That counts as a crossbow, right?

694
01:11:02,109 --> 01:11:02,310
All right.

695
01:11:02,310 --> 01:11:05,560
Let's go again.

696
01:11:05,560 --> 01:11:06,359
I feel like I'm going to like this.

697
01:11:06,359 --> 01:11:06,760
You hold it.

698
01:11:06,760 --> 01:11:13,979
You charge it.

699
01:11:13,979 --> 01:11:19,590
This thing does a lot of damage.

700
01:11:19,590 --> 01:11:24,460
Here's to everybody too.

701
01:11:24,460 --> 01:11:27,500
I like it a lot actually.

702
01:11:27,500 --> 01:11:30,840
We just need a ton of damage.

703
01:11:30,840 --> 01:11:32,439
Why do his eyes look like that?

704
01:11:32,439 --> 01:11:36,390
Like what?

705
01:11:36,390 --> 01:11:36,590
Okay.

706
01:11:36,590 --> 01:11:38,390
So technically it's one shot.

707
01:11:38,390 --> 01:11:44,840
So this would be awesome, right?

708
01:11:44,840 --> 01:11:47,590
Smite everybody after shooting your last shot.

709
01:11:47,590 --> 01:11:49,390
I have one shot.

710
01:11:49,390 --> 01:12:07,899
So yes, exactly precisely what I thought.

711
01:12:07,899 --> 01:12:15,180
This is this is my weapon.

712
01:12:15,180 --> 01:12:15,880
Okay.

713
01:12:15,880 --> 01:12:17,079
That's cool.

714
01:12:17,079 --> 01:12:23,979
I think I'm going with magnetism early.

715
01:12:23,979 --> 01:12:31,680
Make sure I don't have to worry about it later.

716
01:12:31,680 --> 01:12:34,649
You can hold it for a long time.

717
01:12:34,649 --> 01:12:35,149
Wow.

718
01:12:35,149 --> 01:12:35,750
All right.

719
01:12:35,750 --> 01:12:42,430
I didn't know that.

720
01:12:42,430 --> 01:12:50,119
You can probably chew through in a whole line of enemies like that.

721
01:12:50,119 --> 01:12:52,470
All right.

722
01:12:52,470 --> 01:12:55,170
Yes.

723
01:12:55,170 --> 01:12:56,630
Double shot.

724
01:12:56,630 --> 01:12:57,229
Oh fuck.

725
01:12:57,229 --> 01:13:00,079
Yeah, that's disgusting.

726
01:13:00,079 --> 01:13:18,680
That is disgusting.

727
01:13:18,680 --> 01:13:24,210
Okay, a shot behind me too.

728
01:13:24,210 --> 01:13:43,140
I think so.

729
01:13:43,140 --> 01:13:44,439
Who said this sucks?

730
01:13:44,439 --> 01:13:56,859
I don't know if I agree with you.

731
01:13:56,859 --> 01:14:00,180
Dark Arts.

732
01:14:00,180 --> 01:14:06,119
That could be good.

733
01:14:06,119 --> 01:14:07,020
Whoa.

734
01:14:07,020 --> 01:14:08,430
Yep.

735
01:14:08,430 --> 01:14:16,500
This is one shot.

736
01:14:16,500 --> 01:14:17,899
Although it's only doing two damage though.

737
01:14:17,899 --> 01:14:30,720
That's kind of bad.

738
01:14:30,720 --> 01:14:32,819
It doesn't scale with the charge.

739
01:14:32,819 --> 01:14:50,710
Unfortunately, 100% that.

740
01:14:50,710 --> 01:14:53,399
Yeah.

741
01:14:53,399 --> 01:15:15,939
Reload rate is absolutely key here.

742
01:15:15,939 --> 01:15:17,829
Ghost friend.

743
01:15:17,829 --> 01:15:18,529
More reload.

744
01:15:18,529 --> 01:15:19,229
Max ammo.

745
01:15:19,229 --> 01:15:20,029
Wait a minute.

746
01:15:20,029 --> 01:15:22,470
That's probably not a good idea.

747
01:15:22,470 --> 01:15:26,430
Or is it a good idea?

748
01:15:26,430 --> 01:15:27,430
Don't tell him.

749
01:15:27,430 --> 01:15:38,810
Don't tell me what.

750
01:15:38,810 --> 01:15:42,770
Take the lens.

751
01:15:42,770 --> 01:15:46,359
Give all bullets to pass through 30% damage in size.

752
01:15:46,359 --> 01:15:48,760
Oh, that's right.

753
01:15:48,760 --> 01:15:50,630
Oh, I see.

754
01:15:50,630 --> 01:16:14,470
One of these things.

755
01:16:14,470 --> 01:16:24,579
I didn't know he's right next to me.

756
01:16:24,579 --> 01:16:24,779
All right.

757
01:16:24,779 --> 01:16:26,479
What is this one going to be?

758
01:16:26,479 --> 01:16:29,380
Bullet damage and bullet size by permanently every time you heal.

759
01:16:29,380 --> 01:16:30,930
All right.

760
01:16:30,930 --> 01:16:35,970
I got to pick up that other thing then.

761
01:16:35,970 --> 01:16:36,369
Where's that?

762
01:16:36,369 --> 01:16:41,989
Where is it?

763
01:16:41,989 --> 01:16:53,659
Two bounce.

764
01:16:53,659 --> 01:16:54,460
Do the fire.

765
01:16:54,460 --> 01:16:57,739
Pyro Mage.

766
01:16:57,739 --> 01:16:58,340
Not bounce.

767
01:16:58,340 --> 01:17:10,609
Pyro.

768
01:17:10,609 --> 01:17:15,180
Or at least I can kill shit this time.

769
01:17:15,180 --> 01:17:34,550
I was having a lot of trouble killing anything last time.

770
01:17:34,550 --> 01:17:38,619
Bullets that pass through your magic lens will inflict burn.

771
01:17:38,619 --> 01:17:39,119
Pick up range.

772
01:17:39,119 --> 01:17:40,909
Vision range.

773
01:17:40,909 --> 01:18:09,859
I mean, that's probably a good one to take.

774
01:18:09,859 --> 01:18:16,069
Kill a tree.

775
01:18:16,069 --> 01:18:17,170
Tree, tree, tree, tree.

776
01:18:17,170 --> 01:18:17,770
What do you mean tree?

777
01:18:17,770 --> 01:18:20,779
What happened?

778
01:18:20,779 --> 01:18:34,510
Get the freeze so you can kill a tree.

779
01:18:45,319 --> 01:18:49,869
That's three arrows.

780
01:18:49,869 --> 01:18:50,670
Less damage.

781
01:18:50,670 --> 01:18:58,920
But that seems kind of amazing.

782
01:18:58,920 --> 01:19:15,220
It is.

783
01:19:15,220 --> 01:19:23,890
It's plus four projectiles.

784
01:19:23,890 --> 01:19:29,010
Get out of the way.

785
01:19:29,010 --> 01:19:32,739
Dude.

786
01:19:32,739 --> 01:19:34,340
Get out of the fucking way.

787
01:19:34,340 --> 01:20:11,600
Why am I so slow?

788
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:14,680
This one's big.

789
01:20:14,680 --> 01:20:15,380
This is big.

790
01:20:15,380 --> 01:20:17,210
I got to be very careful.

791
01:20:17,210 --> 01:20:20,149
Please be careful.

792
01:20:20,149 --> 01:20:21,550
This is massive.

793
01:20:21,550 --> 01:21:03,420
That's a massive deal.

794
01:21:03,420 --> 01:21:07,020
Yes.

795
01:21:07,020 --> 01:21:56,710
I need the heals.

796
01:21:56,710 --> 01:21:57,609
Sorry.

797
01:21:57,609 --> 01:22:00,199
I'm quiet Andy right now.

798
01:22:00,199 --> 01:22:10,180
But I got to get to the end.

799
01:22:10,180 --> 01:22:20,119
As much damage as your bullets.

800
01:22:20,119 --> 01:22:30,260
Probably this, right?

801
01:22:30,260 --> 01:22:34,760
Reload rate.

802
01:22:34,760 --> 01:22:36,359
That's fire, right?

803
01:22:36,359 --> 01:22:37,949
Do the dagger.

804
01:22:37,949 --> 01:22:43,819
All right, we'll do the magic dagger.

805
01:22:43,819 --> 01:22:45,520
I have to remember that that's my projectile.

806
01:22:45,520 --> 01:23:05,779
I will confuse it.

807
01:23:05,779 --> 01:23:10,640
I went around the tree.

808
01:23:10,640 --> 01:23:19,359
I'm pissed.

809
01:23:19,359 --> 01:24:03,060
I think it's this one.

810
01:24:03,060 --> 01:24:07,979
Oh, that's huge.

811
01:24:07,979 --> 01:24:12,149
That's monstrous.

812
01:24:12,149 --> 01:24:47,270
That is monstrous.

813
01:24:47,270 --> 01:24:50,890
Monstrous.

814
01:24:50,890 --> 01:24:54,789
I just take the health.

815
01:24:54,789 --> 01:24:56,090
So there's just 20.

816
01:24:56,090 --> 01:24:57,430
Just take the extra health.

817
01:24:57,430 --> 01:25:21,800
I'm taking it.

818
01:25:21,800 --> 01:25:26,779
So I'm going to magic scythe.

819
01:25:26,779 --> 01:25:30,199
Bullet speed.

820
01:25:30,199 --> 01:25:31,560
Shield.

821
01:25:31,560 --> 01:25:59,539
Yeah.

822
01:25:59,539 --> 01:26:02,560
Bullet damage and fire rate when you get hit.

823
01:26:02,560 --> 01:26:05,640
That one's pretty good.

824
01:26:05,640 --> 01:26:06,640
I think this one's good.

825
01:26:06,640 --> 01:26:07,340
10 extra damage.

826
01:26:07,340 --> 01:26:08,140
30 extra damage.

827
01:26:08,140 --> 01:26:45,050
Yep.

828
01:26:45,050 --> 01:26:48,909
Let's go.

829
01:26:48,909 --> 01:26:50,710
Oh my God.

830
01:26:50,710 --> 01:26:52,609
Reload rate and speed.

831
01:26:52,609 --> 01:27:02,270
Reload rate.

832
01:27:02,270 --> 01:27:15,989
Am I at the cap?

833
01:27:15,989 --> 01:27:17,189
Holy shit.

834
01:27:17,189 --> 01:27:18,689
Bullet damage and knockback.

835
01:27:18,689 --> 01:27:38,180
Yep.

836
01:27:38,180 --> 01:27:40,649
How come I haven't healed yet?

837
01:27:40,649 --> 01:27:49,510
Don't I have something that heals every time somebody dies by something?

838
01:27:49,510 --> 01:27:51,210
Curse 2 would be insane.

839
01:27:51,210 --> 01:27:51,909
Summon damage.

840
01:27:51,909 --> 01:28:04,680
That's it's definitely curse.

841
01:28:04,680 --> 01:28:05,579
How come you don't blink?

842
01:28:05,579 --> 01:28:06,449
I haven't.

843
01:28:06,449 --> 01:28:09,180
I like I have.

844
01:28:09,180 --> 01:28:11,640
I'm doing curse.

845
01:28:11,640 --> 01:28:12,039
Holy shit.

846
01:28:12,039 --> 01:28:15,119
I probably I don't think I have blinked.

847
01:28:15,119 --> 01:28:15,619
Oh my God.

848
01:28:15,619 --> 01:28:17,369
You're right.

849
01:28:17,369 --> 01:28:17,770
Hold on.

850
01:28:17,770 --> 01:28:23,159
Give me a second.

851
01:28:23,159 --> 01:28:31,399
Jesus.

852
01:28:31,399 --> 01:29:49,069
I just like made my I just made it worse.

853
01:29:49,069 --> 01:29:54,949
We got fire rate and reload rate by 10% permanently every time you get hit.

854
01:29:54,949 --> 01:29:56,149
Okay, that's okay.

855
01:29:56,149 --> 01:30:33,100
I guess this is such a great build.

856
01:30:33,100 --> 01:30:35,640
I can't lose it now.

857
01:30:35,640 --> 01:30:48,880
You got to play smart.

858
01:30:48,880 --> 01:30:54,939
Oh, I don't like that.

859
01:30:54,939 --> 01:31:03,819
That's I mean doubled though better shield.

860
01:31:03,819 --> 01:31:05,619
I think that's the that's the safe play.

861
01:31:05,619 --> 01:32:54,600
Not the cool play, but it's a safe one.

862
01:32:54,600 --> 01:34:40,090
Burn.

863
01:34:40,090 --> 01:34:41,130
See you later.

864
01:34:41,130 --> 01:34:45,199
What do we got?

865
01:34:45,199 --> 01:34:47,920
Speed.

866
01:34:47,920 --> 01:34:48,720
Fire rate.

867
01:34:48,720 --> 01:34:51,689
Spread.

868
01:34:51,689 --> 01:34:52,989
Max ammo.

869
01:34:52,989 --> 01:34:54,960
Summon damage.

870
01:34:54,960 --> 01:34:59,180
It's just speed.

871
01:34:59,180 --> 01:35:25,909
Be careful speed damage.

872
01:35:25,909 --> 01:36:01,159
So yeah, hell yeah.

873
01:36:01,159 --> 01:36:01,760
I just want to kill it.

874
01:36:01,760 --> 01:36:12,210
I need to know what it is.

875
01:36:12,210 --> 01:36:12,710
My God.

876
01:36:12,710 --> 01:36:16,560
This thing's still alive.

877
01:36:16,560 --> 01:36:29,350
Yes, when diamonds HP is at or below half of Max HP piercing plus to a knockback.

878
01:36:29,350 --> 01:36:53,699
Oh, well, look at all these goodies over here.

879
01:36:53,699 --> 01:36:55,399
Zero point five percent chance.

880
01:36:55,399 --> 01:37:15,369
Okay, two minutes.

881
01:37:15,369 --> 01:37:33,760
I feel like it's going to get crazy here in a second.

882
01:37:33,760 --> 01:37:38,560
When Holy Shield is not active kills with smite lower the regeneration time for Holy

883
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:39,760
Shield by one second.

884
01:37:39,760 --> 01:37:40,159
Damn.

885
01:37:40,159 --> 01:37:40,460
All right.

886
01:37:40,460 --> 01:38:02,079
That's amazing.

887
01:38:02,079 --> 01:38:04,689
Try to get to level 30, right?

888
01:38:04,689 --> 01:38:41,579
Probably important.

889
01:38:41,579 --> 01:38:42,079
Oh, yeah.

890
01:38:42,079 --> 01:38:45,789
This is this over 40 seconds.

891
01:38:45,789 --> 01:39:05,279
Nice 30 seconds.

892
01:39:05,279 --> 01:39:27,380
Not level 30, but it's all right.

893
01:39:27,380 --> 01:39:33,430
Yeah, great.

894
01:39:33,430 --> 01:39:34,930
10,000 currency.

895
01:39:34,930 --> 01:39:37,500
Nice.

896
01:39:37,500 --> 01:39:44,640
Very cool.

897
01:39:44,640 --> 01:39:44,939
All right.

898
01:39:44,939 --> 01:39:45,739
Let's do one more.

899
01:39:45,739 --> 01:39:47,340
Just joke one, right?

900
01:39:47,340 --> 01:39:48,340
Let's do one more crazy one.

901
01:39:48,340 --> 01:39:50,670
What do I want to unlock?

902
01:39:50,670 --> 01:39:55,619
Maybe the flamethrower.

903
01:39:55,619 --> 01:40:22,449
Okay, I'm going to do flamethrower and the flame character darkness one small survive

904
01:40:22,449 --> 01:40:27,699
the night to unlock greater challenges small enemy spawn more often.

905
01:40:27,699 --> 01:40:31,579
I'll just do regular fun to watch.

906
01:40:31,579 --> 01:40:35,810
It's kind of like Binding of Isaac.

907
01:40:35,810 --> 01:40:36,310
Oh my goodness.

908
01:40:36,310 --> 01:40:41,800
That's fast.

909
01:40:41,800 --> 01:40:44,199
Well, this is a great character.

910
01:40:44,199 --> 01:40:45,100
It's a joke character.

911
01:40:45,100 --> 01:40:49,579
But I mean when I'm in joke character, I meant joke weapons.

912
01:40:49,579 --> 01:40:54,430
This is not a joke character.

913
01:40:54,430 --> 01:40:56,529
Go darkness one to progress.

914
01:40:56,529 --> 01:41:00,010
That's all right.

915
01:41:00,010 --> 01:41:01,109
I restart.

916
01:41:01,109 --> 01:41:13,189
I wasn't looking at the best kind of the whole game.

917
01:41:13,189 --> 01:41:16,760
Oh, you're betting.

918
01:41:16,760 --> 01:41:21,710
Sorry.

919
01:41:21,710 --> 01:41:22,810
Well, we refund it.

920
01:41:22,810 --> 01:41:30,060
Refund it.

921
01:41:30,060 --> 01:41:30,960
You ruin the bets.

922
01:41:30,960 --> 01:41:31,359
It's all right.

923
01:41:31,359 --> 01:41:33,020
I just we can refund.

924
01:41:33,020 --> 01:41:38,699
It'll work.

925
01:41:38,699 --> 01:41:42,560
The SMG is OP too.

926
01:41:42,560 --> 01:41:46,270
Oh wait, I can do another rune.

927
01:41:46,270 --> 01:41:46,970
All right here.

928
01:41:46,970 --> 01:41:48,369
Now you're betting on this one.

929
01:41:48,369 --> 01:41:52,869
Okay, same deal.

930
01:41:52,869 --> 01:41:55,170
And I will do darkness one.

931
01:41:55,170 --> 01:42:10,939
You turned off the rune.

932
01:42:10,939 --> 01:42:11,939
Wait, don't bet yet.

933
01:42:11,939 --> 01:42:12,739
Wait, hold on.

934
01:42:12,739 --> 01:42:14,140
Did I turn off a rune?

935
01:42:14,140 --> 01:42:14,939
Oh shit.

936
01:42:14,939 --> 01:42:17,600
Hold on.

937
01:42:17,600 --> 01:42:18,899
I unequipped the rune.

938
01:42:18,899 --> 01:42:19,800
Oh, okay.

939
01:42:19,800 --> 01:42:24,819
Well, we're going to restart.

940
01:42:24,819 --> 01:42:26,619
You can only pick one for tree.

941
01:42:26,619 --> 01:42:31,989
Oh, okay.

942
01:42:31,989 --> 01:42:36,739
I didn't know that.

943
01:42:36,739 --> 01:42:37,340
I get it.

944
01:42:37,340 --> 01:42:37,739
All right.

945
01:42:37,739 --> 01:42:42,180
So this is 10% damage and summon damage.

946
01:42:42,180 --> 01:42:47,079
Okay, 10% damage.

947
01:42:47,079 --> 01:42:49,479
10% damage.

948
01:42:49,479 --> 01:42:49,880
All right.

949
01:42:49,880 --> 01:42:56,420
Now you're for real betting on this right now.

950
01:42:56,420 --> 01:42:58,020
I mean you guys it doesn't really matter.

951
01:42:58,020 --> 01:43:00,100
You're going to bet anyways.

952
01:43:00,100 --> 01:43:01,199
Do you think I'm going to win or not?

953
01:43:01,199 --> 01:43:06,390
Like it's not like we have to redo it all.

954
01:43:06,390 --> 01:43:09,060
It's not we don't have to redo it.

955
01:43:09,060 --> 01:43:12,779
You guys are going to bet anyways.

956
01:43:12,779 --> 01:43:21,470
Yeah, it's equipped.

957
01:43:21,470 --> 01:43:21,970
Okay.

958
01:43:21,970 --> 01:43:22,369
Here we go.

959
01:43:22,369 --> 01:43:23,470
Darkness one.

960
01:43:23,470 --> 01:43:24,569
Rune is equipped.

961
01:43:24,569 --> 01:43:25,069
20 minutes.

962
01:43:25,069 --> 01:43:33,890
Let's go for it.

963
01:43:33,890 --> 01:43:37,699
This weapon's fun.

964
01:43:37,699 --> 01:43:38,199
Oops.

965
01:43:38,199 --> 01:43:39,300
Oh, I was too busy.

966
01:43:39,300 --> 01:43:40,000
It's all right.

967
01:43:40,000 --> 01:44:00,920
They haven't even bet yet.

968
01:44:00,920 --> 01:44:01,420
All right.

969
01:44:01,420 --> 01:44:05,949
I'm thinking fire rate, spread, and reload rate.

970
01:44:05,949 --> 01:44:07,350
Fire rate right here.

971
01:44:07,350 --> 01:44:11,460
Bingo.

972
01:44:11,460 --> 01:44:12,760
Oh my god.

973
01:44:12,760 --> 01:44:13,359
Oh my god.

974
01:44:13,359 --> 01:44:16,899
I'm so sorry everybody that's going to lose.

975
01:44:16,899 --> 01:44:35,270
I'm not used to being this slow.

976
01:44:35,270 --> 01:44:43,449
Everything's fine.

977
01:44:43,449 --> 01:44:45,159
I think it's just fun.

978
01:44:45,159 --> 01:44:46,819
But burn.

979
01:44:46,819 --> 01:44:53,220
It's the burn character.

980
01:44:53,220 --> 01:44:58,100
Fire rate.

981
01:44:58,100 --> 01:44:59,000
I need reload rate.

982
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:24,970
Bad.

983
01:45:24,970 --> 01:45:25,670
Reload rate.

984
01:45:25,670 --> 01:45:27,029
There it is.

985
01:45:27,029 --> 01:45:29,729
Oh, double.

986
01:45:29,729 --> 01:45:30,630
I need the reload rate.

987
01:45:30,630 --> 01:45:52,720
Bad.

988
01:45:52,720 --> 01:45:53,520
Don't worry believers.

989
01:45:53,520 --> 01:46:39,329
I got your back.

990
01:46:39,329 --> 01:47:10,210
Oh, ah.

991
01:47:10,210 --> 01:47:11,010
Don't worry believers.

992
01:47:11,010 --> 01:47:42,420
I'm not giving in.

993
01:47:42,420 --> 01:48:55,020
I'm not giving in.

994
01:48:55,020 --> 01:48:56,060
Drastic.

995
01:48:56,060 --> 01:49:25,850
It was drastic, but it should work out.

996
01:49:25,850 --> 01:49:26,550
All right, what do we got?

997
01:49:26,550 --> 01:49:27,149
I got three health.

998
01:49:27,149 --> 01:49:29,979
I'm good.

999
01:49:29,979 --> 01:49:32,380
Burn damage plus 67%.

1000
01:49:32,380 --> 01:49:34,939
Oh my goodness.

1001
01:49:34,939 --> 01:49:37,260
Hey, believers.

1002
01:49:37,260 --> 01:49:38,060
I got you back.

1003
01:49:38,060 --> 01:49:47,510
I almost walked into somebody, I think.

1004
01:49:47,510 --> 01:49:49,760
Why did I narrate that part?

1005
01:49:49,760 --> 01:49:50,560
Like, I got you back.

1006
01:49:50,560 --> 01:49:52,130
I almost just walked into somebody.

1007
01:49:52,130 --> 01:49:53,029
Like, yeah, no shit.

1008
01:49:53,029 --> 01:49:53,930
You fucking idiot.

1009
01:49:53,930 --> 01:49:54,930
Who are you talking about?

1010
01:49:54,930 --> 01:49:55,630
Of course you.

1011
01:49:55,630 --> 01:50:21,829
Oh.

1012
01:50:21,829 --> 01:50:22,729
I'm sorry believers.

1013
01:50:22,729 --> 01:50:24,800
I couldn't help it.

1014
01:50:24,800 --> 01:50:25,699
I was just too slow.

1015
01:50:25,699 --> 01:50:27,199
This thing's so fast.

1016
01:50:27,199 --> 01:50:27,800
I'll win it back.

1017
01:50:27,800 --> 01:50:28,199
I'll get it back.

1018
01:50:28,199 --> 01:50:29,800
Just bet on me right now.

1019
01:50:29,800 --> 01:50:30,399
Bet on me right now.

1020
01:50:30,399 --> 01:50:32,189
I'll get it back right now.

1021
01:50:32,189 --> 01:50:32,890
Bet on me right now.

1022
01:50:32,890 --> 01:50:33,689
Bet on me right now.

1023
01:50:33,689 --> 01:50:34,189
Bet on me right now.

1024
01:50:34,189 --> 01:50:34,489
You lost.

1025
01:50:34,489 --> 01:50:35,890
I know, but bet on me right now.

1026
01:50:35,890 --> 01:50:36,590
Bet on me right now.

1027
01:50:36,590 --> 01:50:37,489
Bet right now.

1028
01:50:37,489 --> 01:50:38,289
Bet on me right now.

1029
01:50:38,289 --> 01:50:40,130
I'm telling you right now to bet on me.

1030
01:50:40,130 --> 01:50:42,430
I am saying bet on me right fucking now.

1031
01:50:42,430 --> 01:50:44,529
I'm going to go all 20 minutes.

1032
01:50:44,529 --> 01:50:45,029
Bet on me.

1033
01:50:45,029 --> 01:50:47,090
I'm telling you do it.

1034
01:50:47,090 --> 01:50:48,289
Do it.

1035
01:50:48,289 --> 01:51:18,069
Check this out.

1036
01:51:18,069 --> 01:51:37,699
I'm telling you bet on me right now.

1037
01:51:37,699 --> 01:51:40,420
I'm not fucking around.

1038
01:51:40,420 --> 01:51:45,619
Not anymore.

1039
01:51:45,619 --> 01:51:48,140
Double shot.

1040
01:51:48,140 --> 01:51:55,270
It just got real right now.

1041
01:51:55,270 --> 01:51:58,210
Imagine being a non-believer right now

1042
01:51:58,210 --> 01:53:20,649
after seeing what I just picked up.

1043
01:53:20,649 --> 01:53:21,050
You're believing?

1044
01:53:21,050 --> 01:53:21,250
Good.

1045
01:53:21,250 --> 01:53:22,760
You should.

1046
01:53:22,760 --> 01:53:25,439
I'm not going to be communicating that much with you.

1047
01:53:25,439 --> 01:53:29,310
I'm trying to win you channel points.

1048
01:53:29,310 --> 01:53:44,430
Mitigation is going to cease as of right now.

1049
01:53:44,430 --> 01:53:45,630
That's burn effect.

1050
01:53:45,630 --> 01:53:48,500
Glare puts on burn effect.

1051
01:53:48,500 --> 01:53:54,260
Can you imagine spending money against me after what you...

1052
01:53:54,260 --> 01:54:12,970
Really?

1053
01:54:12,970 --> 01:54:14,869
I mean, if you bet against me at this point,

1054
01:54:14,869 --> 01:54:16,470
I mean, you got like a...

1055
01:54:16,470 --> 01:54:38,909
Your hands are kind of full of fucking air.

1056
01:54:38,909 --> 01:55:31,420
A lot of crunchies over here.

1057
01:55:31,420 --> 01:55:33,119
Dude, if I win this, I deserve.

1058
01:55:33,119 --> 01:55:38,979
I deserve McDonald's tonight if I win.

1059
01:55:38,979 --> 01:55:41,649
I'm just being really, really honest.

1060
01:55:41,750 --> 01:56:07,939
I deserve five Happy Meals.

1061
01:56:07,939 --> 01:56:08,739
Welcome to McDonald's.

1062
01:56:08,739 --> 01:56:10,140
How can I help you?

1063
01:56:10,140 --> 01:56:13,520
Yeah, I'd like to get five Happy Meals, please.

1064
01:56:13,520 --> 01:56:16,069
I don't have any kids.

1065
01:56:16,069 --> 01:56:20,060
Should I say that?

1066
01:56:20,060 --> 01:56:30,439
Oh, yeah.

1067
01:56:30,439 --> 01:56:33,539
I don't have any kids there for me.

1068
01:56:33,539 --> 01:56:44,279
Okay, I don't care, but all around.

1069
01:56:44,279 --> 01:56:49,399
It's illegal to buy a Happy Meal if you don't have any kids.

1070
01:56:49,399 --> 01:56:50,300
Shut up.

1071
01:56:50,300 --> 01:59:40,319
Not you.

1072
01:59:40,319 --> 01:59:52,500
If you lose, you have to get one of the gyros from Arby's.

1073
01:59:52,500 --> 02:00:00,439
World's grossest fast food item.

1074
02:00:00,439 --> 02:00:05,399
That's not part of the deal.

1075
02:00:05,399 --> 02:00:09,079
That could be the world's grossest fast food item.

1076
02:00:09,079 --> 02:00:11,260
A gyro, gyro.

1077
02:00:11,260 --> 02:00:12,359
There's a, I don't know.

1078
02:00:12,359 --> 02:00:17,930
You know what I mean?

1079
02:00:17,930 --> 02:00:20,449
That's my favorite comment of the whole night.

1080
02:00:20,449 --> 02:00:21,550
Okay, if I...

1081
02:00:21,550 --> 02:00:22,949
No, that's gross.

1082
02:00:22,949 --> 02:00:28,390
I don't want to do that.

1083
02:00:28,390 --> 02:00:31,619
Gyro, gyro, gyro.

1084
02:00:31,619 --> 02:00:32,920
It's gyro.

1085
02:00:32,920 --> 02:00:33,520
Stop.

1086
02:00:33,520 --> 02:00:34,220
What do I pick?

1087
02:00:34,220 --> 02:00:34,720
Do I just leave?

1088
02:00:34,720 --> 02:00:41,239
I don't think any of these work.

1089
02:00:41,239 --> 02:00:45,840
Power, but bullets is not, it's not gonna help.

1090
02:00:45,840 --> 02:00:47,439
Can the fire bounce?

1091
02:00:47,439 --> 02:00:59,500
I feel like that sucks.

1092
02:00:59,500 --> 02:01:00,399
I think I'm just gonna leave.

1093
02:01:00,399 --> 02:01:01,800
I don't like any of these.

1094
02:01:01,800 --> 02:01:07,670
Not for what I have right now.

1095
02:01:07,670 --> 02:01:15,399
Bullet bounce plus two, but can the fire even bounce off anything?

1096
02:01:15,399 --> 02:01:18,399
This would be the one that I'd pick, but I don't really know if I want this.

1097
02:01:18,399 --> 02:01:21,819
Bullets, I mean, maybe this is all right.

1098
02:01:21,819 --> 02:01:26,500
Bouncy fire.

1099
02:01:26,500 --> 02:01:28,409
I'm just leaving.

1100
02:01:28,409 --> 02:01:29,010
Oh, wait.

1101
02:01:29,010 --> 02:01:29,609
No, no, no, no, no.

1102
02:01:29,609 --> 02:01:30,310
That doesn't count.

1103
02:01:30,310 --> 02:01:31,109
That actually doesn't count.

1104
02:01:31,109 --> 02:01:33,550
I pressed D instead of S.

1105
02:01:33,550 --> 02:01:35,550
That, I would have to do it again because I pressed,

1106
02:01:35,550 --> 02:01:38,899
I thought I was pressing S, but I was pressing D instead.

1107
02:01:38,899 --> 02:01:41,000
I took too long on that dumbass screen.

1108
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:42,300
So I pressed D.

1109
02:01:42,300 --> 02:01:44,289
I was trying to hold S.

1110
02:01:44,289 --> 02:01:45,189
Whatever, just bet on me again.

1111
02:01:45,189 --> 02:01:45,890
I promise.

1112
02:01:45,890 --> 02:01:46,189
All right.

1113
02:01:46,189 --> 02:01:47,750
This is the real one.

1114
02:01:47,750 --> 02:01:49,090
This is the real one.

1115
02:01:49,090 --> 02:01:52,289
If I lose, I have to get a fucking gyro from Arby's.

1116
02:01:52,289 --> 02:01:55,050
And if I win, then I get my McDonald's Happy Meals.

1117
02:01:55,050 --> 02:01:55,550
This is the real one.

1118
02:01:55,550 --> 02:02:03,060
This is my bet.

1119
02:02:03,060 --> 02:02:03,659
This one's for real.

1120
02:02:03,659 --> 02:02:28,899
This one's for me.

1121
02:02:28,899 --> 02:02:30,500
You have to eat it live on stream.

1122
02:02:30,500 --> 02:02:35,020
No, I will take a picture of it.

1123
02:02:35,020 --> 02:02:43,229
I will take a picture of at least two bites out of it.

1124
02:02:43,229 --> 02:02:45,060
You know what's crazy?

1125
02:02:45,060 --> 02:02:47,260
I don't want to eat fucking Arby's.

1126
02:02:47,260 --> 02:02:49,260
I don't want that at all.

1127
02:02:49,260 --> 02:02:50,760
I'm gonna try as hard as I can.

1128
02:02:50,760 --> 02:02:52,399
I'm gonna be silent now.

1129
02:02:52,399 --> 02:02:55,140
I don't want to eat an Arby's gyro.

1130
02:02:55,140 --> 02:02:55,939
I don't want that.

1131
02:02:55,939 --> 02:02:58,340
That sounds awful to me right now.

1132
02:02:58,340 --> 02:02:59,739
That's the last thing I want.

1133
02:02:59,739 --> 02:03:02,210
I'm gonna try as hard as I can.

1134
02:03:02,210 --> 02:03:04,210
I'm actually putting both headphones in for this.

1135
02:03:04,210 --> 02:03:04,810
And I'm shutting up.

1136
02:03:04,810 --> 02:04:28,520
I'm not going to talk the rest of the time I'm playing.

1137
02:04:28,520 --> 02:04:30,020
Pyro does not sound like a good idea, though.

1138
02:04:30,020 --> 02:04:32,569
Because why would I get pyro?

1139
02:04:32,569 --> 02:04:34,470
My bullets already inflict burn.

1140
02:04:34,470 --> 02:04:40,229
Why would I do pyro?

1141
02:04:40,229 --> 02:04:40,930
It stacks?

1142
02:04:40,930 --> 02:07:23,329
Okay, I didn't know that.

1143
02:07:23,329 --> 02:09:37,050
That's not good.

1144
02:09:37,050 --> 02:09:38,289
It's dead?

1145
02:09:38,289 --> 02:09:46,039
Oh shit, I killed it.

1146
02:09:46,039 --> 02:10:34,640
Yes.

1147
02:10:34,640 --> 02:10:41,859
Oh my goodness.

1148
02:10:41,859 --> 02:10:45,220
Sick super fast rate.

1149
02:10:45,220 --> 02:10:47,520
Triple base max ammo.

1150
02:10:47,520 --> 02:11:08,619
I get to have McDonald's today.

1151
02:11:08,619 --> 02:11:19,819
All right, let's go.

1152
02:11:19,819 --> 02:11:24,220
I need burn damage, burn damage, burn damage, burn damage.

1153
02:11:24,220 --> 02:11:25,220
I see burn damage up.

1154
02:11:25,220 --> 02:11:25,819
I need it.

1155
02:11:25,819 --> 02:12:14,689
Shit.

1156
02:12:14,689 --> 02:12:16,270
I don't know.

1157
02:12:16,270 --> 02:12:48,270
It's probably Galeria.

1158
02:12:48,270 --> 02:12:49,170
I need lightning too.

1159
02:12:49,170 --> 02:12:50,170
The lightning is going to be...

1160
02:12:50,170 --> 02:12:56,720
The lightning is doing so much work here, more than the fire.

1161
02:12:56,720 --> 02:13:03,800
I need lightning damage increase.

1162
02:13:03,800 --> 02:13:05,750
That's pretty good.

1163
02:13:05,750 --> 02:13:14,720
That's pretty good too.

1164
02:13:14,720 --> 02:13:31,699
I'll go with ice.

1165
02:13:31,699 --> 02:13:52,220
They're closing in.

1166
02:13:52,220 --> 02:14:10,979
I'm surrounded.

1167
02:14:10,979 --> 02:14:29,359
Shoot someone!

1168
02:14:29,359 --> 02:14:31,270
Dark arts.

1169
02:14:31,270 --> 02:14:35,199
Dark arts.

1170
02:14:35,199 --> 02:14:41,090
Arby's, we have the meat.

1171
02:14:41,090 --> 02:14:58,899
Frostbite.

1172
02:14:58,899 --> 02:15:01,560
Jesus, it's that.

1173
02:15:01,560 --> 02:15:02,460
Or it's curse.

1174
02:15:02,460 --> 02:15:31,100
It's curse.

1175
02:15:31,100 --> 02:15:46,520
Oh, it's that one.

1176
02:15:46,520 --> 02:15:47,819
Why are there so many things?

1177
02:15:47,819 --> 02:15:59,210
Oh, it's because I did that hard mode.

1178
02:15:59,210 --> 02:15:59,909
It's that.

1179
02:15:59,909 --> 02:16:05,180
Or I need more reload.

1180
02:16:05,180 --> 02:16:06,180
Bad.

1181
02:16:06,180 --> 02:16:26,409
That's a dire.

1182
02:16:26,409 --> 02:16:29,430
When you inflict freeze, also inflict burn.

1183
02:16:29,430 --> 02:16:33,440
Whoa.

1184
02:16:33,440 --> 02:16:44,309
Let's go.

1185
02:16:44,309 --> 02:16:46,809
The new Arby's disgusting chicken sandwich.

1186
02:16:46,809 --> 02:16:47,610
I feel bad.

1187
02:16:47,610 --> 02:16:49,569
Okay, I feel kind of bad.

1188
02:16:49,569 --> 02:16:53,200
Because like I think Arby's is a fucking awful place.

1189
02:16:53,200 --> 02:16:54,500
But I mean, is it all right?

1190
02:16:54,500 --> 02:16:58,549
I don't know.

1191
02:16:58,549 --> 02:17:09,620
Does that like mean what I'm saying?

1192
02:17:09,620 --> 02:17:11,290
Oh shit.

1193
02:17:11,290 --> 02:17:12,090
Oh no.

1194
02:17:12,090 --> 02:17:54,909
I don't want to go to Arby's.

1195
02:17:54,909 --> 02:17:55,709
Why am I reloading?

1196
02:17:55,709 --> 02:18:00,069
I have auto reload on.

1197
02:18:00,069 --> 02:18:41,870
Every 10 enemies killed by curse will increase your bullet damage by 1% permanently.

1198
02:18:41,870 --> 02:19:00,280
This one.

1199
02:19:00,280 --> 02:19:00,979
Shit, I bumped somebody.

1200
02:19:00,979 --> 02:19:34,409
I didn't even see them.

1201
02:19:34,409 --> 02:20:11,940
I'm okay.

1202
02:20:11,940 --> 02:20:13,040
Where's the boss?

1203
02:20:13,040 --> 02:20:14,829
Where's the boss die?

1204
02:20:14,829 --> 02:21:05,379
Where's the boss?

1205
02:21:08,600 --> 02:21:26,059
It's probably this.

1206
02:21:26,059 --> 02:21:27,159
Watch out for the tree.

1207
02:21:44,709 --> 02:21:46,549
Oh my God, that's so good.

1208
02:21:46,549 --> 02:22:22,600
Come on.

1209
02:22:22,600 --> 02:22:23,899
Oh, yeah.

1210
02:22:23,899 --> 02:22:24,399
Yeah.

1211
02:22:24,399 --> 02:22:25,200
Oh, yeah.

1212
02:22:25,200 --> 02:23:08,559
I think so.

1213
02:23:08,559 --> 02:23:09,920
Glare?

1214
02:23:09,920 --> 02:23:16,639
I think it's glare.

1215
02:23:16,639 --> 02:23:17,340
Glare.

1216
02:23:17,340 --> 02:23:56,870
Let's go.

1217
02:23:56,870 --> 02:25:56,649
Oh, holy shit.

1218
02:25:56,649 --> 02:25:59,149
10% fire rate every time she inflicts burn.

1219
02:25:59,149 --> 02:26:07,250
Oh, knock back.

1220
02:26:07,250 --> 02:26:07,850
Knock back.

1221
02:26:07,850 --> 02:26:08,549
Knock back.

1222
02:26:08,549 --> 02:26:09,149
Knock back.

1223
02:26:09,149 --> 02:26:09,649
Knock back.

1224
02:26:09,649 --> 02:26:24,510
Knock back.

1225
02:26:27,850 --> 02:26:38,989
I don't have to eat at Arby's.

1226
02:26:38,989 --> 02:26:39,790
Well, hold on.

1227
02:26:39,790 --> 02:26:41,090
Don't get cocky.

1228
02:26:41,090 --> 02:26:50,030
I could die really quickly here.

1229
02:26:50,030 --> 02:26:52,530
Fire rate, bullet damage, reload rate, ammo, piercing.

1230
02:26:52,530 --> 02:26:57,120
Yep.

1231
02:26:57,120 --> 02:26:57,819
That's over.

1232
02:26:57,819 --> 02:26:58,819
It's literally over.

1233
02:26:58,819 --> 02:27:08,840
It's over.

1234
02:27:08,840 --> 02:27:32,809
I killed the tree.

1235
02:27:32,809 --> 02:27:35,719
This is just absolutely stupid what's going on right now.

1236
02:27:35,719 --> 02:27:38,909
Look at how fast this is.

1237
02:27:38,909 --> 02:27:40,829
Look at this fire rate.

1238
02:27:40,829 --> 02:28:15,180
The game is broken.

1239
02:28:15,180 --> 02:28:31,489
This whole bet is so stupid.

1240
02:28:31,489 --> 02:28:32,290
Might hit level 40.

1241
02:28:32,290 --> 02:28:49,069
I might.

1242
02:28:49,069 --> 02:28:52,420
38.

1243
02:28:52,420 --> 02:28:53,819
Wait, I'll do this.

1244
02:28:53,819 --> 02:29:14,459
Stand still.

1245
02:29:14,459 --> 02:29:28,530
Firework.

1246
02:29:28,530 --> 02:29:49,020
Holy shit, don't be stupid.

1247
02:29:49,020 --> 02:30:02,750
I don't think I'm not going to hit 40, but still cool.

1248
02:30:02,750 --> 02:30:08,559
I did it.

1249
02:30:08,559 --> 02:30:10,760
Sorry, Arby's fans.

1250
02:30:10,760 --> 02:30:18,590
Not tonight.

1251
02:30:18,590 --> 02:30:22,000
Eating an Arby's gyro.

1252
02:30:22,000 --> 02:30:23,399
That's such a huge punishment.

1253
02:30:23,399 --> 02:30:27,090
I like, wouldn't you feel bad if you were Arby's?

1254
02:30:27,090 --> 02:30:34,030
No, I don't want to lose a bet and eat an Arby's gyro.

1255
02:30:34,030 --> 02:30:34,829
Double or nothing?

1256
02:30:34,829 --> 02:30:38,430
What, I have to eat two Arby's gyros or no?

1257
02:30:38,430 --> 02:30:39,329
There's no double or nothing.

1258
02:30:39,329 --> 02:30:39,829
That's it.

1259
02:30:39,829 --> 02:30:43,309
Your eyes are deep fried.

1260
02:30:43,309 --> 02:30:51,200
They are?

1261
02:30:51,200 --> 02:30:56,979
I think they're okay.

1262
02:30:56,979 --> 02:30:57,479
Maybe not.

1263
02:30:57,479 --> 02:31:01,319
Maybe they're a little weird.

1264
02:31:01,319 --> 02:31:03,000
It was worth it.

1265
02:31:03,000 --> 02:31:05,790
And that's where I'm going to end the stream.

1266
02:31:05,790 --> 02:31:07,090
I think that's a solid place to go out on.

1267
02:31:07,090 --> 02:31:08,920
I will buy some stuff though.

1268
02:31:08,920 --> 02:31:10,920
This game is absolutely fantastic.

1269
02:31:10,920 --> 02:31:14,639
What a great game this is.

1270
02:31:14,639 --> 02:31:15,739
This is really good.

1271
02:31:15,739 --> 02:31:18,290
Very good.

1272
02:31:18,290 --> 02:31:20,090
I got to say, this is wonderful.

1273
02:31:20,090 --> 02:31:24,500
This is a great game.

1274
02:31:24,500 --> 02:31:24,899
Dual S.

1275
02:31:24,899 --> 02:31:48,069
All right, I just want to test these.

1276
02:31:48,069 --> 02:31:54,969
I like this.

1277
02:31:54,969 --> 02:31:59,069
Start the game with your HP at half of your max HP.

1278
02:31:59,069 --> 02:32:05,379
Bullet damage and fire rate by 5% per rank.

1279
02:32:05,379 --> 02:32:09,780
I kind of feel kind of bad.

1280
02:32:09,780 --> 02:32:14,309
I'm going to unlock all the weapons.

1281
02:32:14,309 --> 02:32:20,139
Bat gun, grenade launcher, magic bow.

1282
02:32:20,139 --> 02:32:29,389
All right, I just want to try the SMGs.

1283
02:32:29,389 --> 02:32:29,989
That's kind of cool.

1284
02:32:29,989 --> 02:32:31,489
All right, I'm going to try spark.

1285
02:32:31,489 --> 02:32:32,829
With the dual SMGs.

1286
02:32:32,829 --> 02:32:33,729
I just want to try.

1287
02:32:33,729 --> 02:32:36,799
I'm just going to try.

1288
02:32:36,799 --> 02:32:43,379
I'm going to play for 10 seconds.

1289
02:32:43,379 --> 02:32:48,739
Yeah, it's pretty damn good.

1290
02:32:48,739 --> 02:32:49,440
This is great.

1291
02:32:49,440 --> 02:32:49,940
OK, cool.

1292
02:32:49,940 --> 02:32:52,260
What a great game.

1293
02:32:52,260 --> 02:32:52,959
Synergies.

1294
02:32:52,959 --> 02:32:58,129
Oh, that was helpful.

1295
02:32:58,129 --> 02:32:59,709
All right, I'll see you guys later.

1296
02:32:59,709 --> 02:33:00,709
I'll see you guys on Wednesday.

1297
02:33:00,709 --> 02:33:03,010
Wednesday, we're going to play Sorcery Part 3.

1298
02:33:03,010 --> 02:33:08,100
Going back to it should be a nice, chill stream.

1299
02:33:08,100 --> 02:33:09,100
Thanks for watching today.

1300
02:33:09,100 --> 02:33:10,629
The games were fun.

1301
02:33:10,629 --> 02:33:13,600
Had a good time, as always.

1302
02:33:13,600 --> 02:33:15,000
And I'll see you guys on Wednesday.

1303
02:33:15,000 --> 02:33:18,000
And then again, I'll be on Name Your Price on Austin Show's

1304
02:33:18,000 --> 02:33:25,209
Name Your Price this Thursday.

1305
02:33:25,209 --> 02:33:33,049
I think I earned a Happy Meal.

1306
02:33:33,250 --> 02:33:33,750
Thanks for watching.

1307
02:33:33,750 --> 02:33:38,319
Thanks for the support.

1308
02:33:38,319 --> 02:33:44,680
Take care of yourselves.

1309
02:33:44,680 --> 02:33:50,940
Hopefully we see you soon.

1310
02:33:50,940 --> 02:33:55,760
This has to be five Happy Meals.

1311
02:33:55,760 --> 02:33:59,159
If I had lost that round, I would have been like,

1312
02:33:59,159 --> 02:33:59,959
all right, see you guys later.

1313
02:33:59,959 --> 02:34:02,360
Yeah, I'll tweet out the Arby's.

1314
02:34:02,360 --> 02:34:03,159
I would have turned the stream off.

1315
02:34:03,159 --> 02:34:06,500
I would have went and talked to Holly.

1316
02:34:06,500 --> 02:34:09,520
I would have closed the door and been like,

1317
02:34:09,520 --> 02:34:16,579
how do we fake me eating Arby's because I really don't want it?

1318
02:34:16,579 --> 02:34:17,379
But I would have to prove it.

1319
02:34:17,379 --> 02:34:25,979
I would have to have to take a bite on camera and prove it to you, right?

1320
02:34:25,979 --> 02:34:32,860
Oh, God.

1321
02:34:32,860 --> 02:34:35,190
Somebody got a McDonald's ad.

1322
02:34:35,190 --> 02:34:41,159
Really?

1323
02:34:41,159 --> 02:34:46,850
Well, you're making it sound so much worse than it is.

1324
02:34:46,850 --> 02:34:49,909
I know it's not that bad,

1325
02:34:49,909 --> 02:34:57,370
but I actually genuinely don't like Arby's at all.

1326
02:34:57,370 --> 02:35:05,709
It is probably one of my least favorite fast food places.

1327
02:35:05,709 --> 02:35:06,409
Have you ever eaten it?

1328
02:35:06,409 --> 02:35:10,209
Yes, I've had it twice and both times I said,

1329
02:35:10,209 --> 02:35:22,430
I do not really like this.

1330
02:35:22,430 --> 02:35:31,530
You're making it sound like you're forced to eat prison slop.

1331
02:35:31,530 --> 02:35:36,520
The new Arby's prison slop sandwich full of meat,

1332
02:35:36,520 --> 02:35:40,040
cheese, and onions.

1333
02:35:40,040 --> 02:35:49,219
Authentic to the real thing.

1334
02:35:49,219 --> 02:35:50,120
All right, I'll see you guys later.

1335
02:35:50,120 --> 02:35:51,500
See you guys Wednesday.

1336
02:35:51,500 --> 02:35:55,889
Starting at, let's see, what time should I start on Wednesday?

1337
02:35:55,889 --> 02:35:57,290
We're probably going to start early on Wednesday.

1338
02:35:57,290 --> 02:36:04,159
Probably like somewhere between 12 and 1.

1339
02:36:04,159 --> 02:36:07,260
We'll probably start somewhere around 12 31 on Wednesday.

1340
02:36:07,260 --> 02:36:12,790
Pacific.

1341
02:36:12,790 --> 02:36:13,190
Good night, though.

1342
02:36:13,190 --> 02:36:14,950
We'll see you soon.

1343
02:36:14,950 --> 02:36:17,700
Take it easy.

1344
02:36:17,700 --> 02:37:05,420
Goodbye.

1345
02:37:05,420 --> 02:37:05,719
Yeah.

1346
02:37:05,719 --> 02:37:06,700
Yes.

1347
02:37:06,700 --> 02:37:07,000
Yes.

1348
02:37:07,000 --> 02:37:08,840
Call your mother, of course.

1349
02:37:08,840 --> 02:37:12,579
It's implied.

1350
02:37:12,579 --> 02:37:12,879
See you later.
