26
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,160
That's all the plus twos I got. That's not fair.

27
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:38,419
It really isn't. Hold on, let me make sure I get this right.

28
00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:43,029
You've farmed plus twos for the last two and a half hours and now they're gone.

29
00:08:43,029 --> 00:08:45,029
You've farmed plus twos for the last two and a half hours and now they're gone.

30
00:08:45,029 --> 00:08:50,279
No, just everyone wants to give me shit.

31
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:54,419
That's fine.

32
00:08:54,419 --> 00:09:00,179
You want to give me shit? That's not a shower.

33
00:09:00,179 --> 00:09:10,149
That's the menu.

34
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:12,149
Hi, Professor Jerma. Hey, thanks.

35
00:09:12,149 --> 00:09:18,730
Oh, right.

36
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:22,759
Let me make sure I turn this on.

37
00:09:22,759 --> 00:09:26,279
It should be on now. Cool.

38
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:34,019
Make sure I turn this on.

39
00:09:34,019 --> 00:09:46,419
Okay.

40
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:50,009
Okay.

41
00:09:50,009 --> 00:09:54,149
Summa cum laude, here we come. Is that a good one?

42
00:09:54,149 --> 00:10:11,100
I think it's pretty good. I think that's fun.

43
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:26,519
That's fun. Alright, but yeah.

44
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:29,019
In all seriousness, no fucking around.

45
00:10:29,019 --> 00:10:31,019
We are going to be playing Two Point Campus on stream today.

46
00:10:31,019 --> 00:10:34,659
It is going to be an ad stream.

47
00:10:34,659 --> 00:10:37,480
It is going to be an ad stream.

48
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,480
The game actually looks really fun.

49
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:43,429
I actually want to play it, so it seems like it's pretty fun.

50
00:10:43,429 --> 00:10:46,870
Let's go for it.

51
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:49,820
You guys ready? I'm opening it now.

52
00:10:49,820 --> 00:11:00,169
I've heard good things.

53
00:11:00,169 --> 00:11:10,789
I've heard good things.

54
00:11:10,789 --> 00:11:13,159
Was the Black Ops 2 stream sponsored?

55
00:11:13,159 --> 00:11:16,100
Why would Black Ops 2 stream be

56
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:23,460
a 10-year-old game?

57
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:25,460
Alright, let me make sure this is still here.

58
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:31,740
So by the same people that made Two Point

59
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:37,480
Hospital, we played that, if you remember.

60
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:49,299
I remember having a good time with that.

61
00:11:56,330 --> 00:12:02,539
I'll put the camera on, I promise.

62
00:12:02,539 --> 00:12:06,620
Alright, let's go. Alright, let's go.

63
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:20,039
I will put the camera on. See?

64
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:22,220
A man of my word. And I'm freshly

65
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:24,519
showered. And by freshly showered, I mean I threw a little

66
00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:30,330
bit of water in my face. And that's it.

67
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:33,139
I definitely look a little less greasy, though, don't you think?

68
00:12:33,139 --> 00:12:39,159
I look clean, don't I?

69
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:44,460
I'm ready to go. Are you ready to go?

70
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:49,639
Okay, Two Point Campus. New game?

71
00:12:49,639 --> 00:13:07,610
What is going on in the school?

72
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:15,029
Wait, you can be a clown?

73
00:13:15,029 --> 00:13:24,500
What is happening here?

74
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,500
If I can make a clown college, that is what I'm doing.

75
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,500
Without a doubt, that's what I'm doing.

76
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:39,059
Two Point Hospital was fun.

77
00:13:39,059 --> 00:13:45,139
I guess you can build the whole campus, too.

78
00:13:45,139 --> 00:13:47,769
You can do the whole outdoor area, everything.

79
00:13:47,769 --> 00:13:55,960
So, it's gonna be fun.

80
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,519
What? Why did that building just shake?

81
00:13:58,519 --> 00:14:01,590
Alright, select a member of staff.

82
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:05,620
I'm Albert Crank.

83
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:07,620
Your own per- wait.

84
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:10,179
Unplug this.

85
00:14:10,179 --> 00:14:12,179
Your own personal advisor, and I'm here to help.

86
00:14:12,179 --> 00:14:16,340
You may or may not have

87
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:18,340
an experience as a campus administrator,

88
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:20,340
but the people at Fresh Lay County

89
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:22,340
College are eager to give you a chance.

90
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:24,340
I didn't scam anybody.

91
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:27,480
I'm not sure what that

92
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,480
says about them, but hey, let's head to

93
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,480
Fresh Lay Meadows and get started

94
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,909
on your academic empire.

95
00:14:33,909 --> 00:14:37,429
Hashtag advertising.

96
00:14:37,429 --> 00:14:39,429
This actually is probably gonna be fun.

97
00:14:39,429 --> 00:14:41,429
Alright, this country-side college has low expectations

98
00:14:41,429 --> 00:14:43,429
and a nice canal. It's the perfect place for you to start your career.

99
00:14:43,429 --> 00:14:45,740
Alright, let's go.

100
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:50,220
Campus Management 101.

101
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:58,139
Is that the school mascot?

102
00:15:10,139 --> 00:15:12,139
Long ago, by dignified

103
00:15:12,139 --> 00:15:14,139
people who wore bowler hats

104
00:15:14,139 --> 00:15:16,139
and spoke via subtitle,

105
00:15:16,139 --> 00:15:18,139
the world is a creation

106
00:15:18,139 --> 00:15:20,139
of the past, and it is

107
00:15:20,139 --> 00:15:22,139
our job to keep it all going

108
00:15:22,139 --> 00:15:24,139
and try not to touch anything.

109
00:15:26,139 --> 00:15:29,769
Stewie Griffin. Alright.

110
00:15:29,769 --> 00:15:31,769
It looks really nice. The graphics are

111
00:15:31,769 --> 00:15:34,649
beautiful. I thought that said

112
00:15:34,649 --> 00:15:37,269
Scientology.

113
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:39,269
Alright, first day of school.

114
00:15:39,269 --> 00:15:41,580
Welcome to Fresh Lay Meadows,

115
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:43,580
where life moves slowly and expectations

116
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:45,580
are lowly. The two-point

117
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:47,580
countryside is the perfect place to start your career.

118
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:49,580
Learn the ropes, make mistakes, and hit the

119
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:53,100
ground smiling.

120
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,100
Scientography.

121
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:57,269
Ten students, alright.

122
00:15:57,269 --> 00:16:03,929
Alright, there's no school.

123
00:16:03,929 --> 00:16:06,679
It's just an auditorium.

124
00:16:06,679 --> 00:16:08,860
Okay, learn the basics of

125
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:10,860
campus management. Try moving the camera

126
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:12,860
and have a look around. You got it? Okay.

127
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:21,740
Okay. Zoom the camera.

128
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:26,789
Pan the camera. Sure.

129
00:16:26,789 --> 00:16:28,789
Spin the camera. Pitch the camera.

130
00:16:28,789 --> 00:16:32,309
R and F. Oh, okay.

131
00:16:32,309 --> 00:16:36,919
He's desync.

132
00:16:36,919 --> 00:16:42,409
Shouldn't be. Okay.

133
00:16:42,409 --> 00:16:44,409
So our campus is going to be running a Scientography

134
00:16:44,409 --> 00:16:46,409
course. Let's start by building a science

135
00:16:46,409 --> 00:16:50,309
lab. Okay. 18,000?

136
00:16:50,309 --> 00:16:54,470
That sounds fine. Alright, so

137
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:57,220
it should probably be in the corner. How big

138
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:59,220
should it be?

139
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:03,320
Should it be huge?

140
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:06,779
I don't think it needs to be that big.

141
00:17:06,779 --> 00:17:09,900
Five by five? Okay, so

142
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,900
it's a science lab. Let's put a door here.

143
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:20,390
This is actually way too small.

144
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:25,180
Okay. I got it.

145
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:27,180
Do you want to sell one invalid item?

146
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:30,569
Wait, no. What? What's invalid?

147
00:17:30,569 --> 00:17:33,769
Make the entire school a

148
00:17:33,769 --> 00:17:39,660
cafeteria.

149
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:42,730
Yeah? Okay, cool. There we go.

150
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:47,660
Let's hire a teacher.

151
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:54,950
The dabbing. Okay.

152
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:56,950
Toby Eastgate is going to be our Scientography

153
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:58,950
streamer.

154
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:00,950
Streamer.

155
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:02,950
I can't speech jam myself with this audio.

156
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:05,769
Okay. 70%

157
00:18:05,769 --> 00:18:08,069
teaching skill. Excellent personal

158
00:18:08,069 --> 00:18:10,069
hygiene. Toilet comfort

159
00:18:10,069 --> 00:18:12,069
decreases slower than most.

160
00:18:12,069 --> 00:18:14,380
Dives head first. Alright.

161
00:18:18,339 --> 00:18:24,680
Did you say he can't work

162
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,680
in the science lab?

163
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,680
Wait, we only have one course?

164
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,680
Where's he going?

165
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:41,690
Where are you going?

166
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:50,380
Where are you going? We have to start the

167
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:53,059
school year.

168
00:18:55,500 --> 00:19:00,150
Where's this guy going?

169
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:02,150
The students are about to arrive and this guy is walking

170
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:04,150
around on acid in the front lawn.

171
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:13,420
Here come the students.

172
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:16,809
Oh, hold on.

173
00:19:16,809 --> 00:19:22,819
There we go. Okay.

174
00:19:22,819 --> 00:19:27,180
Why are we all going the long way?

175
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:31,660
That's easier to go in there. Oh, I guess

176
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:33,660
it's closer. He's the teacher. It's closer.

177
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:40,420
Okay. Wait.

178
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:42,420
Do we do the class in here?

179
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:48,170
What's this for?

180
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:55,000
There are no seats.

181
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Oh, okay. Here they go. They're in their first class.

182
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:02,809
First day.

183
00:20:02,809 --> 00:20:08,950
There's no place to sit down. Hey,

184
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:16,950
put those down. This is dangerous.

185
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:25,460
We just make cubes?

186
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:27,460
There are no seats and there's no desks.

187
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:31,180
Okay. The students

188
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:33,539
learn experience points.

189
00:20:33,539 --> 00:20:35,539
Increase their academic level.

190
00:20:35,539 --> 00:20:41,369
Okay. Where's the teacher?

191
00:20:41,369 --> 00:20:45,849
What are they making? They're making

192
00:20:45,849 --> 00:20:49,369
gas. That's not

193
00:20:49,369 --> 00:20:53,460
normal. Oh, by the way,

194
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,460
Two Point Campus is across all major platforms.

195
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:57,460
You can get it on

196
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:59,460
PC. You can get it on PlayStation.

197
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:01,460
You can get it on Xbox. You can get it on

198
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:09,589
everything. All right. So it's almost done.

199
00:21:09,589 --> 00:21:13,690
Almost more than any gloves.

200
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:23,930
Feels fine. Squeaky clean. Iron

201
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:25,930
blood.

202
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:34,299
Did you get chin extensions?

203
00:21:34,299 --> 00:21:36,299
Yeah.

204
00:21:48,299 --> 00:21:50,299
This camera sucks,

205
00:21:50,299 --> 00:21:52,470
okay?

206
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:54,470
Okay. Class is over.

207
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:56,470
They passed the

208
00:21:56,470 --> 00:21:58,470
first class. Sadly,

209
00:21:58,470 --> 00:22:00,470
they didn't do all that well. It seems a number of them

210
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:02,470
were distracted by one

211
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:04,470
need or another. What?

212
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:06,970
What are they doing?

213
00:22:26,569 --> 00:22:28,569
Okay. Take a look at our campus.

214
00:22:28,569 --> 00:22:30,569
Take a look at our students

215
00:22:30,569 --> 00:22:32,569
and see what we can do to improve the campus.

216
00:22:32,569 --> 00:22:39,220
Stop making me feel

217
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:41,220
jealous by telling me how many consoles this game is on.

218
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:43,220
I only own two, and you're making me feel

219
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:45,220
jealous of other people's possessions.

220
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:47,220
Bro, you own two of the

221
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:49,220
current gen consoles?

222
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:53,130
What?

223
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:55,619
Okay. Okay. We need

224
00:22:55,619 --> 00:22:57,619
bathroom.

225
00:22:57,619 --> 00:23:00,759
Tired?

226
00:23:00,759 --> 00:23:02,759
The key to campus hospitality is remember that

227
00:23:02,759 --> 00:23:04,759
three Rs. Students need somewhere

228
00:23:04,759 --> 00:23:06,759
to relax, rest themselves,

229
00:23:06,759 --> 00:23:09,000
and relieve themselves. Sure, two of those

230
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
might be the same thing, but it does sound convincing.

231
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Let's build a dormitory

232
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
and a bathroom to keep people comfortable.

233
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,180
This poor kid.

234
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:20,180
Okay, I need to build a dorm.

235
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:22,619
Build a dorm.

236
00:23:22,619 --> 00:23:28,950
Dormitory. How big?

237
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:34,069
It's got to be big, right?

238
00:23:34,069 --> 00:23:38,809
Can I make the campus bigger? It's got to be

239
00:23:38,809 --> 00:23:44,700
a lot. Shit.

240
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:48,470
How do I fix that? I need to fix that.

241
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:55,559
Okay.

242
00:23:57,559 --> 00:24:01,460
Okay, place an item.

243
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:26,789
You can rotate it. Okay.

244
00:24:26,789 --> 00:24:30,059
This is like a fucking hospital.

245
00:24:38,359 --> 00:24:40,359
Turning into a barracks.

246
00:24:40,359 --> 00:24:44,519
How many beds do I have to have?

247
00:24:44,519 --> 00:24:46,519
What?

248
00:24:46,519 --> 00:24:48,519
Okay. Okay. Okay.

249
00:24:48,519 --> 00:24:53,900
Oh, shit. I thought it was

250
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:55,900
tutorialing me.

251
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,900
I thought I was getting tutorialed.

252
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:59,900
Because remember I put the door down.

253
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:01,900
I put the wardrobe down.

254
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,900
It selected it for me.

255
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:11,900
Okay.

256
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:15,900
I need an ATM.

257
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:19,900
Everybody gets a hand sanitizer

258
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:21,900
next to their bed.

259
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:29,900
Where's the bathroom?

260
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:37,589
Alright, where's the bathroom?

261
00:25:37,589 --> 00:25:43,029
Do not cancel this room.

262
00:25:43,029 --> 00:25:45,400
Okay, we good?

263
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:51,220
Wormitory is a great place for students to relax

264
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:53,220
when they're low on energy. One bed between

265
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:55,220
five students is considered normal on

266
00:25:55,220 --> 00:26:00,920
campus. What?

267
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:15,369
Okay. Students may dream

268
00:26:15,369 --> 00:26:17,369
of having their own bed, but they'll happily

269
00:26:17,369 --> 00:26:19,369
share with a few friends. What are you talking

270
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:24,490
about? They don't get it at the same

271
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:27,940
time. Who gets into

272
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:30,180
a bed like that?

273
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:32,180
That's a weird

274
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:34,180
person. That's a weird

275
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:36,180
person. Who gets into a bed

276
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:38,180
long ways? Nobody.

277
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:42,339
Oh, there's only one wardrobe.

278
00:26:42,339 --> 00:26:44,339
Why are there bones in there?

279
00:26:44,339 --> 00:26:46,339
Why is there a dead body in there?

280
00:26:46,339 --> 00:26:49,289
Why is there a dead body in there?

281
00:26:49,289 --> 00:26:51,720
Alright, hold on. I'm confused.

282
00:26:51,720 --> 00:27:02,470
I need a bathroom.

283
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:14,940
Okay. Sink.

284
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:18,259
Okay.

285
00:27:18,259 --> 00:27:22,039
Hand dryer.

286
00:27:22,039 --> 00:27:25,880
Plant. Hand sanitizations.

287
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:28,819
Okay.

288
00:27:28,819 --> 00:27:31,900
And a window. No!

289
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,900
A window?

290
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:35,900
Put in some slot machines.

291
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:38,519
Okay.

292
00:27:38,519 --> 00:27:43,059
Bathroom done. New room

293
00:27:43,059 --> 00:27:47,859
unlocked. Shower room. Did you

294
00:27:47,859 --> 00:27:50,680
hear that? I think our students might be hungry.

295
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,680
Originally, campuses offer a range of

296
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,680
food and drink to, you know, sustain life.

297
00:27:54,680 --> 00:28:03,190
Let's add some vending machines.

298
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:10,279
I think I didn't make it.

299
00:28:10,279 --> 00:28:12,279
Wait, you just went to the bathroom. Why are you still

300
00:28:12,279 --> 00:28:14,279
holding your stomach?

301
00:28:14,279 --> 00:28:17,289
This person...

302
00:28:17,289 --> 00:28:19,289
Why are they doing this?

303
00:28:19,289 --> 00:28:21,289
Why does everybody have diarrhea?

304
00:28:21,289 --> 00:28:24,490
What happened?

305
00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:28,009
Everyone's holding their stomachs?

306
00:28:28,009 --> 00:28:30,009
Oh, they're hungry. Okay. Right, right, right, right.

307
00:28:30,009 --> 00:28:33,589
That's my bed. Okay.

308
00:28:33,589 --> 00:28:40,250
How do I get food?

309
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:42,420
Oh, okay. Here we go.

310
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:44,420
Cheesy gubbins machine.

311
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:51,269
I don't have to go far.

312
00:29:06,009 --> 00:29:09,019
Alright. If we were up to the students,

313
00:29:09,019 --> 00:29:11,019
I'm sure we'd be all living in our own filth.

314
00:29:11,019 --> 00:29:13,019
We have very little say in the matter.

315
00:29:13,019 --> 00:29:15,900
Let's hire a janitor and place a bin.

316
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:21,339
Okay. Jackie

317
00:29:21,339 --> 00:29:23,700
Clear. Wait, these are teachers.

318
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:26,259
Jeff Vacuum.

319
00:29:26,259 --> 00:29:28,259
That's a great, great janitor name.

320
00:29:28,259 --> 00:29:30,700
Jeff Vacuum.

321
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:32,700
I think is the one that we

322
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:40,180
hire. Okay.

323
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:42,180
There's a drink stand right here. You're good.

324
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:47,750
You're fine. Okay, so.

325
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:50,380
Place one bin. Alright, you got it.

326
00:29:50,380 --> 00:30:02,859
No one authorized

327
00:30:02,859 --> 00:30:14,309
talking? Okay.

328
00:30:14,309 --> 00:30:21,099
Let's see how the students do in the next class.

329
00:30:21,099 --> 00:30:23,099
Oh, shit. Alright, we're doing a lecture.

330
00:30:23,099 --> 00:30:34,549
Pass a Scientography

331
00:30:34,549 --> 00:30:36,549
class with a C+.

332
00:30:36,549 --> 00:30:41,720
What do you got for grades?

333
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,720
Bursting. Feeling

334
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,720
freshly. Peckish, thirsty, tired,

335
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:48,019
bursting, and bored.

336
00:30:48,019 --> 00:30:56,279
Oh. Where are the rest of the students?

337
00:30:56,279 --> 00:31:09,079
Absolutely

338
00:31:09,079 --> 00:31:11,380
bursting.

339
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:13,380
Tired, peckish, and thirsty. So

340
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:19,910
go to the bathroom.

341
00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:21,910
That's funny that there's bursting and absolutely

342
00:31:21,910 --> 00:31:24,339
bursting. That's different.

343
00:31:24,339 --> 00:31:31,579
It's in the books.

344
00:31:31,579 --> 00:31:36,180
Everyone's sleeping in the same

345
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:41,049
two beds.

346
00:31:41,049 --> 00:31:43,049
They're just sharing these two beds. I don't need

347
00:31:43,049 --> 00:31:50,089
these many. Okay.

348
00:31:50,089 --> 00:31:52,089
Who are you?

349
00:31:52,089 --> 00:31:54,089
This is the class clown. Makes things

350
00:31:54,089 --> 00:31:56,089
nice and cheery with a steady stream of jokes

351
00:31:56,089 --> 00:31:58,089
and slapstick delights.

352
00:31:58,089 --> 00:32:00,089
The class is just an audience that keeps coming back.

353
00:32:00,089 --> 00:32:02,259
Keeps people entertained and has

354
00:32:02,259 --> 00:32:06,680
poor hygiene. I love

355
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:11,480
this guy. Let's see. Tell me a joke.

356
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:14,619
Oh, there we go.

357
00:32:14,619 --> 00:32:16,980
The better they do, the more money you'll have

358
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:18,980
to fund the campus who's smart now.

359
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:20,980
Yes, you get tuition

360
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:22,980
fees from all students enrolled in courses at the campus

361
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:24,980
as well as a bonus for how much XP they're earning.

362
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:26,980
Sick.

363
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:29,160
All right.

364
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:31,160
What? Studying.

365
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:33,160
Okay.

366
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,160
I need a place to study. Completing

367
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:37,160
assignments is a great way for students to earn XP

368
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:39,160
away from the classroom, but it looks like they

369
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:41,160
need...

370
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:48,150
Are they throwing just trash down

371
00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:54,490
on the ground here?

372
00:32:54,490 --> 00:32:56,490
You're a faculty, man. Pick that up.

373
00:32:56,490 --> 00:32:58,490
You're setting a really bad example for all these fucking

374
00:32:58,490 --> 00:33:01,049
kids. What are you doing?

375
00:33:01,049 --> 00:33:05,019
Why would you do that? Okay.

376
00:33:05,019 --> 00:33:07,019
Check your inbox

377
00:33:07,019 --> 00:33:11,670
to see what they need.

378
00:33:11,670 --> 00:33:14,299
All right. This is the check on

379
00:33:14,299 --> 00:33:16,299
requests. Library requested.

380
00:33:16,299 --> 00:33:19,430
Okay. Henrietta Belcher

381
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:21,430
has requested a library.

382
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:23,430
And nine people have agreed on Facebook.

383
00:33:23,430 --> 00:33:30,339
Or whatever social media.

384
00:33:30,339 --> 00:33:41,930
I'm running out of room.

385
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:48,390
How do I make the room bigger? How do I make this room bigger?

386
00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:55,799
Try it again.

387
00:33:55,799 --> 00:34:01,559
Library. That looks good.

388
00:34:01,559 --> 00:34:05,019
All right. Let's put this here.

389
00:34:05,019 --> 00:34:08,659
There. See?

390
00:34:08,659 --> 00:34:11,539
See how it's doing it? Okay.

391
00:34:11,539 --> 00:34:13,539
I got everything I need. I'll do one more bookshelf over here.

392
00:34:13,539 --> 00:34:17,380
And...

393
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:19,380
Hand sanitizer. And a trash can.

394
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:24,300
And...

395
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:28,579
That's good. All right. Completing

396
00:34:28,579 --> 00:34:30,579
assignment in the library. You got it.

397
00:34:30,579 --> 00:34:36,900
What's that icon? Can I just sell all this stuff?

398
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:38,900
I don't... I mean...

399
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:46,949
Oh, this dormitory sucks.

400
00:34:46,949 --> 00:34:48,949
I can't believe they're removing the beds.

401
00:34:48,949 --> 00:34:51,380
Oh, what's that?

402
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:53,380
We're all sleeping in the same two beds.

403
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:55,380
And we have... These have been like

404
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:57,380
fresh, cleaned

405
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:59,380
beds that no one's touched.

406
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:08,519
And I'm getting points removed for that.

407
00:35:08,519 --> 00:35:13,960
Move this. That's fine.

408
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:18,820
I'm gonna pull the room over a little.

409
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:20,820
It doesn't have to be this big.

410
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:28,230
What? Oh, it's

411
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:30,230
a copy. I thought it was move.

412
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:32,539
Okay.

413
00:35:48,539 --> 00:35:50,539
Okay, now I'm gonna... Let's edit this building.

414
00:35:52,539 --> 00:35:54,539
I wanna pull this in.

415
00:35:54,539 --> 00:35:56,539
I wanna pull it in.

416
00:35:58,539 --> 00:36:00,539
I wanna pull this in.

417
00:36:00,539 --> 00:36:02,539
Like that, right?

418
00:36:02,539 --> 00:36:06,119
Subtract, right?

419
00:36:06,119 --> 00:36:08,119
All right. Subtract it.

420
00:36:08,119 --> 00:36:10,119
Much better. All right. That's fine.

421
00:36:10,119 --> 00:36:14,469
That's more realistic now.

422
00:36:14,469 --> 00:36:16,469
Those don't very much room for whatever.

423
00:36:16,469 --> 00:36:19,800
Maybe like a food place or something?

424
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,800
Get the banner?

425
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:25,190
Okay, I need to hire an assistant.

426
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:27,559
Open the hire staff menu to view

427
00:36:27,559 --> 00:36:29,559
applicants.

428
00:36:29,559 --> 00:36:32,380
Full of staff for different jobs. New applicants will apply.

429
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:34,380
Okay, so I need an assistant.

430
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:39,429
Assistant.

431
00:36:39,429 --> 00:36:44,809
Oh, that's for the library. Shit, okay.

432
00:36:44,809 --> 00:36:46,809
Okay, makes...

433
00:36:46,809 --> 00:36:48,809
Happiness brings happiness. What does this bring?

434
00:36:48,809 --> 00:36:51,349
Comedic timing? Yeah.

435
00:36:51,349 --> 00:36:54,550
Moves fast and is really clean.

436
00:36:54,550 --> 00:37:01,510
Yeah, for sure.

437
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:03,690
All right, okay. You're good.

438
00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:06,699
Open the library.

439
00:37:09,449 --> 00:37:13,159
Oh, there he is.

440
00:37:13,159 --> 00:37:15,159
All right, we gotta make sure this... We gotta make sure this student

441
00:37:15,159 --> 00:37:19,579
gets an A+.

442
00:37:19,579 --> 00:37:21,579
Some of our students are completing an assignment in the library.

443
00:37:21,579 --> 00:37:23,750
Great way to earn XP outside the classroom.

444
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:27,659
Cool. What's your schedule?

445
00:37:27,659 --> 00:37:32,519
You got science here?

446
00:37:32,519 --> 00:37:35,340
In January? Hold on.

447
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:38,539
You have one class in January.

448
00:37:38,539 --> 00:37:40,969
And...

449
00:37:40,969 --> 00:37:42,969
You're just gonna stay here from like

450
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:44,969
August through July?

451
00:37:44,969 --> 00:37:47,530
A full year? You got one class?

452
00:37:47,530 --> 00:37:52,070
I need more than one class.

453
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:54,070
No wonder everyone's walking around aimlessly.

454
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:56,070
There's only one piece of curriculum and one teacher.

455
00:37:56,070 --> 00:38:00,420
Oh, shit. All right.

456
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:03,429
There's only one class.

457
00:38:03,429 --> 00:38:05,429
Stay on campus for a year.

458
00:38:05,429 --> 00:38:07,429
You know, and go to class for one week.

459
00:38:09,429 --> 00:38:14,360
All right, let's go. It's a tutorial.

460
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:17,239
So, where do we get to build our own shit?

461
00:38:17,239 --> 00:38:21,460
Apparently, there's a relationship system.

462
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:24,150
Which, I wonder how that works.

463
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:26,150
I'm very curious.

464
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:33,260
The bathroom's bigger than the library.

465
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:40,409
Yeah. Everybody needs to go to the bathroom.

466
00:38:40,409 --> 00:38:42,840
Everybody doesn't study.

467
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:45,530
Do you need me to explain that further?

468
00:38:45,530 --> 00:38:54,809
Maybe you should... All right. Pass a sign...

469
00:38:54,809 --> 00:38:56,809
I keep...

470
00:38:56,809 --> 00:38:58,809
Intography class.

471
00:38:58,809 --> 00:39:01,050
They're gonna get a B. Look, they're doing pretty good.

472
00:39:01,050 --> 00:39:03,050
Oh, wait. There's the Joker.

473
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:18,710
What's wrong? What'd he do?

474
00:39:18,710 --> 00:39:20,710
What did he do?

475
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:28,710
What did he do? Why did he say free?

476
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:34,710
I don't get it. What happened?

477
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:42,710
Oh, they're bored.

478
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:44,710
Bored.

479
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:46,710
Just get a B and we'll be fine.

480
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:54,650
Hired.

481
00:39:54,650 --> 00:40:00,920
How do I make a... Is there a...

482
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:02,920
Do the teachers go home?

483
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:07,139
Statement, okay.

484
00:40:07,139 --> 00:40:09,579
Tuition fees, rent, XP bonus,

485
00:40:09,579 --> 00:40:11,579
and then staff wages. All right, cool.

486
00:40:11,579 --> 00:40:13,579
Seven grand.

487
00:40:13,579 --> 00:40:15,940
All right, we're good.

488
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:19,940
So, can this be used for more than just

489
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:24,619
the science class?

490
00:40:24,619 --> 00:40:26,619
The science class?

491
00:40:26,619 --> 00:40:32,630
Nice.

492
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:34,630
Okay, if you had a B+, you'd get an A-.

493
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:37,449
If I'm the teacher and I look out the window

494
00:40:37,449 --> 00:40:39,449
and you got like

495
00:40:39,449 --> 00:40:41,449
an 88, or like an 89

496
00:40:41,449 --> 00:40:43,449
on this exam here,

497
00:40:43,449 --> 00:40:45,449
and I see you doing those funny movements out the window

498
00:40:45,449 --> 00:40:47,449
just kind of dancing around, I'm turning it into

499
00:40:47,449 --> 00:40:50,519
a 91. I'm making it a 91.

500
00:40:50,519 --> 00:40:54,809
Your students have gone from C grade

501
00:40:54,809 --> 00:40:56,809
chumps to B grade brain heads.

502
00:40:56,809 --> 00:40:58,809
Let's recap how you did.

503
00:40:58,809 --> 00:41:04,039
All right, tutorial over.

504
00:41:04,039 --> 00:41:06,039
Provide better staff and facilities to improve

505
00:41:06,039 --> 00:41:08,280
your students' grades. Make students happy

506
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:10,280
and comfortable to increase their learning rate.

507
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:12,280
Earn more cash by growing your campus and

508
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:14,650
enrolling more students. All right.

509
00:41:14,650 --> 00:41:20,409
Spend Kudosh to unlock

510
00:41:20,409 --> 00:41:22,409
new items as well as staff outfits and interior

511
00:41:22,409 --> 00:41:25,159
design options. Okay, I got half a

512
00:41:25,159 --> 00:41:28,230
million. Unlock an item with

513
00:41:28,230 --> 00:41:32,579
Kudosh. Okay.

514
00:41:32,579 --> 00:41:37,690
Oh, hell yeah.

515
00:41:37,690 --> 00:41:41,849
Arcade machine.

516
00:41:41,849 --> 00:41:43,849
What if there's no actual

517
00:41:43,849 --> 00:41:45,849
learning? I just make a bunch of food places

518
00:41:45,849 --> 00:41:53,139
and arcade games.

519
00:41:53,139 --> 00:41:55,139
Just make a big arcade with no actual

520
00:41:55,139 --> 00:42:02,309
learning. And just give everybody A's.

521
00:42:02,309 --> 00:42:06,539
Make a casino

522
00:42:06,539 --> 00:42:10,119
college. Test your strength.

523
00:42:10,119 --> 00:42:12,119
Yeah, definitely. All right, where am I going to put this?

524
00:42:12,119 --> 00:42:17,110
In the bathroom?

525
00:42:17,110 --> 00:42:19,110
You go take a piss and then you come out and just

526
00:42:19,110 --> 00:42:31,579
I got 200 points.

527
00:42:31,579 --> 00:42:36,360
Okay. What is this?

528
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:43,530
You didn't even try.

529
00:42:43,530 --> 00:42:46,340
You stink.

530
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:48,340
You are offensively

531
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:54,550
smelly.

532
00:42:54,550 --> 00:42:57,179
Oh, I need showers. Oops.

533
00:42:57,179 --> 00:42:59,179
You're right. You're right. I need showers.

534
00:42:59,179 --> 00:43:01,179
Where do I do that?

535
00:43:01,179 --> 00:43:12,420
Shower room. Okay.

536
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:16,519
Right here.

537
00:43:16,519 --> 00:43:18,519
Security breach. Please change

538
00:43:18,519 --> 00:43:20,519
your passwords. What?

539
00:43:20,519 --> 00:43:22,519
Oh, I thought you meant. Okay. Was it? What the hell?

540
00:43:22,519 --> 00:43:24,699
All right. Let's have

541
00:43:26,699 --> 00:43:28,699
How many of these should I have in here?

542
00:43:28,699 --> 00:43:33,690
And now for the segment we call

543
00:43:33,690 --> 00:43:35,690
Agony Answers.

544
00:43:35,690 --> 00:43:37,690
Should be individual rooms, right?

545
00:43:37,690 --> 00:43:39,690
Agony Answers. This week's

546
00:43:39,690 --> 00:43:41,690
problem is

547
00:43:41,690 --> 00:43:43,690
Get out and lie down under

548
00:43:43,690 --> 00:43:45,690
these.

549
00:43:45,690 --> 00:43:47,690
Just lay down flat and push all the buttons.

550
00:43:47,690 --> 00:43:50,179
I'd start by

551
00:43:50,179 --> 00:43:52,179
contacting someone under less

552
00:43:52,179 --> 00:43:54,179
anonymous circumstances.

553
00:43:54,179 --> 00:43:56,179
Perhaps a friend of the local authorities.

554
00:43:56,179 --> 00:43:58,179
Best of luck and so on.

555
00:43:58,179 --> 00:44:01,190
Okay.

556
00:44:01,190 --> 00:44:08,539
Door? Is that all right?

557
00:44:08,539 --> 00:44:12,380
Is that okay? Is this okay?

558
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:16,219
Do I have to have

559
00:44:16,219 --> 00:44:18,219
Separation?

560
00:44:18,219 --> 00:44:26,199
This is fine, right?

561
00:44:26,199 --> 00:44:49,750
Why is there no shower

562
00:44:49,750 --> 00:44:53,980
curtain?

563
00:44:53,980 --> 00:44:55,980
Just like a

564
00:44:55,980 --> 00:44:57,980
Mario collect the star animation

565
00:44:57,980 --> 00:44:59,980
and got naked

566
00:44:59,980 --> 00:45:01,980
without a curtain or anything.

567
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:04,599
I probably should put

568
00:45:04,599 --> 00:45:09,849
doors, right?

569
00:45:09,849 --> 00:45:12,280
All right. What's wrong

570
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:16,699
with you? You have a staff

571
00:45:16,699 --> 00:45:18,699
on break with nowhere to relax.

572
00:45:18,699 --> 00:45:20,940
Where? Where are they?

573
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:26,059
I have one teacher.

574
00:45:26,059 --> 00:45:28,059
This one overworked teacher.

575
00:45:28,059 --> 00:45:32,539
Where are they? Where's my

576
00:45:32,539 --> 00:45:40,090
staff? Is he sleeping in his

577
00:45:40,090 --> 00:45:42,760
car?

578
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:45,190
No. Wait, wait. There you are.

579
00:45:45,190 --> 00:45:56,820
I need a staff room.

580
00:45:56,820 --> 00:45:58,820
I need a staff room. Staff room.

581
00:45:58,820 --> 00:46:03,179
I need another teacher.

582
00:46:03,179 --> 00:46:09,130
This person wants a dorm?

583
00:46:09,130 --> 00:46:17,130
What happens when this gets all the way filled?

584
00:46:17,130 --> 00:46:19,130
Students are reminded

585
00:46:19,130 --> 00:46:21,500
that I'm not your mom.

586
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:24,119
Jeff vacuum is really carrying this place.

587
00:46:24,119 --> 00:46:30,329
Okay, I need a staff room.

588
00:46:30,329 --> 00:46:32,329
Staff room. I have no room. I need a

589
00:46:32,329 --> 00:46:40,969
bigger building.

590
00:46:40,969 --> 00:46:49,480
We got to make this really comfortable.

591
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:51,480
There are literally two people

592
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:53,659
that work here. I don't need more than one

593
00:46:53,659 --> 00:46:57,940
couch. I was like,

594
00:46:57,940 --> 00:47:00,699
why are they running? Let's do

595
00:47:00,699 --> 00:47:03,579
a nice lamp

596
00:47:03,579 --> 00:47:08,380
and a TV.

597
00:47:08,380 --> 00:47:10,380
Oh, a dart board. That's nice.

598
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:14,659
Sky painting.

599
00:47:18,309 --> 00:47:21,960
Purple rug.

600
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:25,099
Okay. A

601
00:47:25,099 --> 00:47:27,099
snack table with

602
00:47:27,099 --> 00:47:29,849
cookies and shit. Yeah.

603
00:47:29,849 --> 00:47:34,889
I think that's good.

604
00:47:34,889 --> 00:47:40,010
Here we go. I need some more staff.

605
00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:46,300
How about another teacher?

606
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:48,469
Okay, Mack Pike.

607
00:47:48,469 --> 00:47:51,610
Weed infestation?

608
00:47:51,610 --> 00:47:54,739
Isn't that just college? What are you talking about?

609
00:47:54,739 --> 00:47:58,460
Alright, how about Randy Bird?

610
00:47:58,460 --> 00:48:07,610
What do you teach? Wait, what do you

611
00:48:07,610 --> 00:48:11,699
teach? Okay.

612
00:48:11,699 --> 00:48:14,969
Scientography. Where are these weeds?

613
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:20,420
Where are these weeds?

614
00:48:20,420 --> 00:48:27,980
This one? That's not a problem.

615
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:29,980
Alright, I'll get another

616
00:48:29,980 --> 00:48:32,409
assistant. Oh, no. Another janitor.

617
00:48:32,409 --> 00:48:36,570
Maintenance. Yeah.

618
00:48:36,570 --> 00:48:40,280
Definitely.

619
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:42,280
Actually, you know, take care of the weeds.

620
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:47,780
Okay, B+. That's good.

621
00:48:47,780 --> 00:48:51,369
Student lounge wanted.

622
00:48:51,369 --> 00:48:54,179
I've tried kicking back in every

623
00:48:54,179 --> 00:48:56,179
room on campus, but nothing is quite hitting the spot.

624
00:48:56,179 --> 00:48:58,179
I think we need a dedicated room for students to hang out

625
00:48:58,179 --> 00:49:01,190
to relax in the lounge in.

626
00:49:01,190 --> 00:49:09,320
Alright, fine. Can't fit there.

627
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:18,860
That's good enough.

628
00:49:18,860 --> 00:49:26,969
Microwave.

629
00:49:26,969 --> 00:49:30,039
What are you going to microwave?

630
00:49:30,039 --> 00:49:32,039
The, like, old mac and cheese

631
00:49:32,039 --> 00:49:34,039
machine stuff you get out of that?

632
00:49:34,039 --> 00:49:37,619
Why would the people...

633
00:49:37,619 --> 00:49:39,619
Okay, it's microwaved out of

634
00:49:39,619 --> 00:49:41,619
here, and then you re-microwave

635
00:49:41,619 --> 00:49:46,360
it over here.

636
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:48,360
Okay, here we go. How about some, like, video

637
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:56,099
games? Okay, move this

638
00:49:56,099 --> 00:49:59,159
into here. That's better.

639
00:49:59,159 --> 00:50:01,159
You're listening to campus radio.

640
00:50:01,159 --> 00:50:03,159
I love TP.

641
00:50:03,159 --> 00:50:05,159
Okay.

642
00:50:05,159 --> 00:50:07,659
What is that?

643
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:12,139
This is a clown

644
00:50:12,139 --> 00:50:16,869
trunk. Yep.

645
00:50:16,869 --> 00:50:18,869
And funny costumes.

646
00:50:18,869 --> 00:50:22,900
Fancy hats. That's a pretty good

647
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:24,900
student relax room.

648
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:28,739
This is not even a couch. I need,

649
00:50:28,739 --> 00:50:33,989
like, a chair. There.

650
00:50:33,989 --> 00:50:37,900
Good enough. Alright, go have fun.

651
00:50:37,900 --> 00:50:45,960
Alright, we need... Students will

652
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:47,960
send a request. Level

653
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:51,800
3 science lab. There we go.

654
00:50:51,800 --> 00:51:00,250
Okay, how do I level up the science lab?

655
00:51:00,250 --> 00:51:04,090
Why is the environment so bad?

656
00:51:04,090 --> 00:51:07,929
Cheese and fire crackers.

657
00:51:07,929 --> 00:51:14,519
There are a lot of jobs for janitors around

658
00:51:14,519 --> 00:51:16,519
campus. I already have

659
00:51:16,519 --> 00:51:18,519
two janitors.

660
00:51:18,519 --> 00:51:25,820
How do I upgrade the room?

661
00:51:25,820 --> 00:51:31,380
That music's a little loud.

662
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:44,739
There you go. That's better. Maybe make the room

663
00:51:44,739 --> 00:51:48,840
bigger and add furniture. Oh!

664
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:56,949
Where'd you get a hot dog?

665
00:51:56,949 --> 00:52:02,780
Do I sell hot dogs here? You're not going to eat it?

666
00:52:02,780 --> 00:52:05,079
Wait, you're just going to microwave a

667
00:52:05,079 --> 00:52:07,079
hot dog in the bun and then

668
00:52:07,079 --> 00:52:10,469
put it in your pocket?

669
00:52:13,719 --> 00:52:15,719
Okay, wait, wait, wait. They have a bee.

670
00:52:15,719 --> 00:52:18,659
Oh, okay, hold on. Let me add some stuff.

671
00:52:18,659 --> 00:52:24,739
Okay, we need... Here we go.

672
00:52:24,739 --> 00:52:26,920
More, like, science equipment.

673
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:31,699
A whiteboard.

674
00:52:31,699 --> 00:52:33,699
And, dude,

675
00:52:33,699 --> 00:52:35,699
that's $8,000. No.

676
00:52:35,699 --> 00:52:49,059
That's good enough.

677
00:52:49,059 --> 00:52:51,500
Is that enough? I need a roof?

678
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:56,420
There's already a roof on here. Campus management.

679
00:52:56,420 --> 00:53:00,179
No, we're good. Alright,

680
00:53:00,179 --> 00:53:05,429
level 3 science lab.

681
00:53:05,429 --> 00:53:07,429
Room prestige. This place still sucks.

682
00:53:07,429 --> 00:53:09,429
Hold on.

683
00:53:11,429 --> 00:53:14,179
Oh, I got it. End of the year rewards.

684
00:53:14,179 --> 00:53:17,510
Oh, my God.

685
00:53:17,510 --> 00:53:20,070
I just punched you in the face. I'm sorry.

686
00:53:20,070 --> 00:53:24,420
So what happened? Expelled?

687
00:53:24,420 --> 00:53:31,719
Alright.

688
00:53:31,719 --> 00:53:34,730
My pass rate is 100%.

689
00:53:34,730 --> 00:53:36,730
Average exam is 81%.

690
00:53:42,070 --> 00:53:44,070
Oh, okay, so now end of the year. No one's here

691
00:53:44,070 --> 00:53:47,659
so I can do management.

692
00:53:47,659 --> 00:53:49,659
Okay, let's expand our range of courses by starting

693
00:53:49,659 --> 00:53:51,659
a virtual normality course.

694
00:53:54,469 --> 00:53:56,780
Alright, new course. Next year's fee

695
00:53:56,780 --> 00:53:58,780
is $180,000

696
00:53:58,780 --> 00:54:02,360
for the year?

697
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:06,360
Okay, so this is the virtual reality

698
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:08,360
class.

699
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:12,360
Can I do something else, too? That sounds good.

700
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:18,119
Alright, cool. Buy a new plot

701
00:54:18,119 --> 00:54:20,420
for your second year.

702
00:54:20,420 --> 00:54:22,420
This is not quite business as usual here at

703
00:54:22,420 --> 00:54:24,420
Duckworth Campus Food Court.

704
00:54:24,420 --> 00:54:26,420
Where one of the servers has lost

705
00:54:26,420 --> 00:54:28,420
a contact lens.

706
00:54:28,420 --> 00:54:30,420
Unfortunately, they do believe the lens was

707
00:54:30,420 --> 00:54:32,420
lost during the preparation of a

708
00:54:32,420 --> 00:54:34,420
particularly big lasagna.

709
00:54:34,420 --> 00:54:36,420
They're asking every student

710
00:54:36,420 --> 00:54:38,420
to check their portion before

711
00:54:38,420 --> 00:54:40,420
they chew. But as of yet,

712
00:54:40,420 --> 00:54:42,420
no sight of the missing

713
00:54:42,420 --> 00:54:44,420
lens. I have to redo some of this.

714
00:54:44,420 --> 00:54:46,420
This looks pretty terrible.

715
00:54:46,420 --> 00:54:48,420
This looks terrible.

716
00:54:48,420 --> 00:54:51,690
I should have one be

717
00:54:51,690 --> 00:54:54,820
dormitory, right?

718
00:54:54,820 --> 00:54:56,820
Dorm. Student

719
00:54:56,820 --> 00:54:58,820
facilities.

720
00:54:58,820 --> 00:55:01,900
Food. Lunch. Yeah.

721
00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:03,900
One of them's going to be the

722
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:06,329
actual work building.

723
00:55:06,329 --> 00:55:08,500
So, we're going to change this.

724
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:10,500
This is going to be the actual student dormitory

725
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:15,110
student facility. Okay, so let's move this.

726
00:55:15,110 --> 00:55:17,110
Why are the students still here? It's summer break.

727
00:55:21,059 --> 00:55:27,780
What's the problem?

728
00:55:27,780 --> 00:55:31,860
Course points?

729
00:55:31,860 --> 00:55:40,250
What are the course points?

730
00:55:40,250 --> 00:55:43,449
Alright, get rid of this.

731
00:55:43,449 --> 00:55:45,449
Can I move this whole building? The whole thing?

732
00:55:45,449 --> 00:56:11,369
Just sell it?

733
00:56:11,369 --> 00:56:13,860
Move your webcam?

734
00:56:13,860 --> 00:56:16,489
Oh, sorry. Oops.

735
00:56:16,489 --> 00:56:18,489
Just remake it? Yeah, I'll sell it.

736
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:22,920
Alright, everybody take a shower

737
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:25,159
but then get out of here.

738
00:56:25,159 --> 00:56:29,769
Alright, close the room. Everybody out.

739
00:56:29,769 --> 00:56:32,070
Sell this whole thing.

740
00:56:32,070 --> 00:56:34,570
Fourteen thousand dollars. You got it.

741
00:56:34,570 --> 00:56:41,670
Okay, cool. Someone was

742
00:56:41,670 --> 00:56:46,980
in there. Alright, we're good.

743
00:56:46,980 --> 00:56:48,980
Okay, pause the game

744
00:56:48,980 --> 00:56:52,699
because the people are going to freak out.

745
00:56:52,699 --> 00:56:58,579
Oh, yeah. Actually,

746
00:56:58,579 --> 00:57:08,760
probably over here is better. It's better over here.

747
00:57:15,349 --> 00:57:17,349
Alright, it's paused.

748
00:57:17,349 --> 00:57:19,349
Alright, so now, it's time to

749
00:57:19,349 --> 00:57:21,909
expand. You can build.

750
00:57:21,909 --> 00:57:25,500
A lot of areas in this game.

751
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:27,500
Like never before?

752
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:29,500
Mirror world?

753
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:33,500
Oh, you think I look weird because

754
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:35,500
I flipped it, right?

755
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:39,500
Yeah, this is weird.

756
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:41,500
This is when you take a picture of yourself

757
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:43,500
with an iPhone

758
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:45,500
and your face looks like

759
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:48,889
you hit it with a hammer like five times

760
00:57:48,889 --> 00:57:53,500
because you're seeing yourself flipped.

761
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:55,500
It's like, what's wrong with my face?

762
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:57,800
Why does my face look like that?

763
00:57:57,800 --> 00:58:03,860
No, I know what you mean. Watch.

764
00:58:03,860 --> 00:58:07,320
I'll show you. Ready? So, check this out.

765
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:12,500
This is what I actually look like.

766
00:58:12,500 --> 00:58:20,420
Isn't that weird?

767
00:58:20,420 --> 00:58:22,420
This is what my face looks like, for real.

768
00:58:22,420 --> 00:58:25,750
But if you flip it, it turns you into like a

769
00:58:25,750 --> 00:58:48,260
nightmare person. See?

770
00:58:48,260 --> 00:58:55,050
You definitely, you caught me.

771
00:58:55,050 --> 00:58:58,889
It does look weird, though. I agree.

772
00:59:01,380 --> 00:59:03,380
Okay, two point campus!

773
00:59:03,380 --> 00:59:09,260
Which, by the way, in case you didn't know,

774
00:59:09,260 --> 00:59:13,530
by the same people that made Two Point Hospital

775
00:59:13,530 --> 00:59:16,789
and in case you didn't know, it's on every

776
00:59:16,789 --> 00:59:18,969
it's on, it's PlayStation, it's on

777
00:59:18,969 --> 00:59:21,659
PC, it's on Xbox.

778
00:59:21,659 --> 00:59:23,659
There's a new and improved relationship system. Have I told you

779
00:59:23,659 --> 00:59:27,940
that one yet? Have we talked about that yet?

780
00:59:27,940 --> 00:59:29,940
Nurture and grow your students with a deeper and more meaningful

781
00:59:29,940 --> 00:59:32,679
sense of connection. In case you didn't know.

782
00:59:32,679 --> 00:59:34,679
Keep the students happy with clubs, societies,

783
00:59:34,679 --> 00:59:36,679
gigs. Surround them with friends.

784
00:59:36,679 --> 00:59:38,679
Help them develop relationships and furnish them with

785
00:59:38,679 --> 00:59:44,019
care. You understand?

786
00:59:44,019 --> 00:59:48,119
That's in this game. Nurture!

787
00:59:48,119 --> 00:59:53,480
Nurture!

788
00:59:53,480 --> 00:59:56,739
Why are you in a fisheye lens?

789
00:59:56,739 --> 00:59:59,500
Can I do a fisheye lens?

790
00:59:59,500 --> 01:00:01,500
Hold on. Can I do a slight fisheye

791
01:00:01,500 --> 01:00:08,409
lens? Is that possible in just like

792
01:00:08,409 --> 01:00:12,440
OBS? Not enough, just enough to

793
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:14,440
look a little weird. What's action movie?

794
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:17,260
Holy shit, I look so much

795
01:00:17,260 --> 01:00:19,260
cooler. What?

796
01:00:19,260 --> 01:00:27,429
Oh, yes.

797
01:00:27,429 --> 01:00:29,429
That looks so much better. Wow.

798
01:00:29,429 --> 01:00:31,429
Actually, I'm keeping this filter on. I'm not even getting around.

799
01:00:31,429 --> 01:00:36,940
These look so much better than just being

800
01:00:36,940 --> 01:00:38,940
a regular. No, I'm putting

801
01:00:38,940 --> 01:00:41,940
this one. Look at how good this looks.

802
01:00:41,940 --> 01:00:43,940
This actually looks better. That's ridiculous.

803
01:00:43,940 --> 01:00:50,090
Okay. Well, that's cool.

804
01:00:50,090 --> 01:00:56,550
I'm gonna keep this on. I thought I just

805
01:00:56,550 --> 01:00:58,550
I thought I just closed my fucking OBS

806
01:00:58,550 --> 01:01:01,880
and end of the stream. Alright.

807
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:03,880
Hey, I gotta play. I gotta play. I gotta play.

808
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:09,579
If I go to the school and some psycho keeps

809
01:01:09,579 --> 01:01:11,579
stealing the shower.

810
01:01:11,579 --> 01:01:14,579
That's very weird considering

811
01:01:14,579 --> 01:01:16,579
that you're supposed to be paused

812
01:01:16,579 --> 01:01:18,579
and frozen. So you're not actually

813
01:01:18,579 --> 01:01:20,579
here. Because if you were, you

814
01:01:20,579 --> 01:01:22,579
wouldn't be talking right now, would you?

815
01:01:31,960 --> 01:01:34,710
Okay. Don't just drag it

816
01:01:34,710 --> 01:01:37,780
like an idiot. Where do I want

817
01:01:37,780 --> 01:01:39,780
all the beds? Right here, right?

818
01:01:39,780 --> 01:01:45,989
I'm thinking just like right here

819
01:01:45,989 --> 01:01:47,989
and then we'll do bathrooms, shower

820
01:01:47,989 --> 01:01:51,510
and then student facilities. So

821
01:01:51,510 --> 01:01:53,510
this is gonna be dorm rooms, beds and shit.

822
01:01:53,510 --> 01:01:59,960
That doesn't need to be huge. It doesn't

823
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:03,480
need to be gigantic. We want good

824
01:02:03,480 --> 01:02:07,829
beds. So let's go like one,

825
01:02:07,829 --> 01:02:10,900
two, up to

826
01:02:10,900 --> 01:02:13,340
five people can have a bed together.

827
01:02:13,340 --> 01:02:15,340
It's weird to say that out loud. I know. I'm sorry.

828
01:02:15,340 --> 01:02:26,280
Okay. It's five, ten, fifteen,

829
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:30,119
twenty, twenty-five, thirty.

830
01:02:30,119 --> 01:02:34,090
That's I can add them later if I need to.

831
01:02:34,090 --> 01:02:39,769
There's that. We should have a couple

832
01:02:39,769 --> 01:02:43,480
wardrobes so people aren't fighting over it.

833
01:02:43,480 --> 01:02:51,460
Add some desks. Okay.

834
01:02:51,460 --> 01:02:57,269
Okay. What is this?

835
01:02:57,269 --> 01:03:00,090
Oh, a dorm notice board.

836
01:03:00,090 --> 01:03:04,309
Where should this go? How about like right here?

837
01:03:04,309 --> 01:03:07,639
See? People like that.

838
01:03:07,639 --> 01:03:13,579
Trash can.

839
01:03:13,579 --> 01:03:30,260
Trash cans. What is this?

840
01:03:30,260 --> 01:03:34,170
Oh, I thought I had four hundred and sixty-nine

841
01:03:34,170 --> 01:03:36,340
thousand Kudosh

842
01:03:36,340 --> 01:03:39,159
coins. I was gonna say this is not

843
01:03:39,159 --> 01:03:41,659
tuned correctly. I was like this is

844
01:03:41,659 --> 01:03:43,659
really inexpensive. You can definitely buy everything.

845
01:03:43,659 --> 01:03:46,340
That's why I was just buying everything.

846
01:03:46,340 --> 01:03:48,340
I thought I had five hundred grand in this currency.

847
01:03:48,340 --> 01:03:51,400
So I bought some of this

848
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:53,400
dumb shit. How much was the clown

849
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:58,900
trunk? This feels like my channel point

850
01:03:58,900 --> 01:04:03,510
rewards. That's what I was thinking. I was like, ah,

851
01:04:03,510 --> 01:04:05,510
they're very low. It's like

852
01:04:05,510 --> 01:04:07,510
two hundred channel points

853
01:04:07,510 --> 01:04:15,829
to do anything here.

854
01:04:15,829 --> 01:04:17,829
This is the relationship bed?

855
01:04:17,829 --> 01:04:19,829
I bought this painting.

856
01:04:19,829 --> 01:04:21,829
Well, I have to use it then.

857
01:04:21,829 --> 01:04:23,829
Everybody gets one.

858
01:04:23,829 --> 01:04:29,099
Okay, I'm

859
01:04:29,099 --> 01:04:35,369
turning the clown sounds off. Everybody

860
01:04:35,369 --> 01:04:40,360
gets one of these. And I got the rug too.

861
01:04:40,360 --> 01:04:42,659
So we're gonna put a rug down under

862
01:04:42,659 --> 01:04:51,110
a couple of the beds. Okay.

863
01:04:51,110 --> 01:04:55,380
Sanitizer. Plant.

864
01:04:55,380 --> 01:05:08,760
Yeah, I'm gonna delete all channel points. All channel

865
01:05:08,760 --> 01:05:13,690
points are getting deleted. And we're gonna bring

866
01:05:13,690 --> 01:05:15,690
it back even stronger. You know

867
01:05:15,690 --> 01:05:19,079
what I mean? Okay, so that's fine. This is a nice little

868
01:05:19,079 --> 01:05:21,079
dorm area. This bed needs to be

869
01:05:21,079 --> 01:05:26,650
actually on the wall. Everything looks good, right?

870
01:05:26,650 --> 01:05:29,019
Okay. So that's good.

871
01:05:29,019 --> 01:05:35,139
What am I missing? What's wrong? Oh, there's

872
01:05:35,139 --> 01:05:40,460
no door. There's dormitory

873
01:05:40,460 --> 01:05:44,980
too, apparently. All right.

874
01:05:44,980 --> 01:05:46,980
So now I'm gonna make a bathroom right here.

875
01:05:46,980 --> 01:05:52,099
Bathroom and shower room will be right

876
01:05:52,099 --> 01:05:55,219
here and here. And then

877
01:05:55,219 --> 01:05:57,849
the hangout room will be here. And there you

878
01:05:57,849 --> 01:06:03,030
go. What do you

879
01:06:03,030 --> 01:06:05,030
guys do in channel points? I gotta turn off channel points.

880
01:06:05,030 --> 01:06:07,030
Delete. Make channel points not redeemable.

881
01:06:07,030 --> 01:06:33,449
Sink. Hand dryer.

882
01:06:33,449 --> 01:06:37,400
And a

883
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:41,429
trash, just in case.

884
01:06:41,429 --> 01:06:43,429
Wait, one more sink on the other side. Yeah, right here.

885
01:06:43,429 --> 01:06:48,469
Now I need a door. I actually want

886
01:06:48,469 --> 01:06:51,800
the door to be here. I screwed it up on them.

887
01:06:51,800 --> 01:07:01,639
That's better. Okay. Shower's gonna

888
01:07:01,639 --> 01:07:04,309
go here. I'm smart. I have

889
01:07:04,309 --> 01:07:06,309
to turn off channel points right now. It's out of

890
01:07:06,309 --> 01:07:09,960
control. How do I turn channel points

891
01:07:09,960 --> 01:07:12,260
off? I need to turn it off right now. How do I turn it off?

892
01:07:12,260 --> 01:07:23,380
How do you turn off channel points? How do you turn

893
01:07:23,380 --> 01:07:26,139
them off? I have to turn them off now. Yeah, no, no, no.

894
01:07:26,139 --> 01:07:29,269
Fine. I'm not gonna turn it off. Would you

895
01:07:29,269 --> 01:07:31,829
shut up? We'll put it in emote only

896
01:07:31,829 --> 01:07:33,829
mode and you shut your

897
01:07:33,829 --> 01:07:36,519
shut up. I'm very angry right

898
01:07:36,519 --> 01:07:38,519
now. This is a sponsor stream and you're making

899
01:07:38,519 --> 01:07:49,079
us look bad. How am I supposed to show up

900
01:07:49,079 --> 01:07:55,079
to the board meeting? Huh? How am I supposed

901
01:07:55,079 --> 01:07:57,260
to show up to the next board meeting and explain

902
01:07:57,260 --> 01:07:59,750
to everybody at that part of the

903
01:07:59,750 --> 01:08:03,980
organization what's going on here? By the way,

904
01:08:03,980 --> 01:08:09,420
the board is me and Otto.

905
01:08:09,420 --> 01:08:12,420
And by the way, he's the accountant. I don't handle

906
01:08:12,420 --> 01:08:19,210
that. Don't delete the room. Room's done.

907
01:08:19,210 --> 01:08:25,020
Yeah, keep it in emote only.

908
01:08:25,020 --> 01:08:27,020
They're abusing the channel points and I don't like

909
01:08:27,020 --> 01:08:29,449
it. It's making me very, very upset.

910
01:08:29,449 --> 01:08:37,060
Don't you just imagine Otto with like a pair of glasses

911
01:08:37,060 --> 01:08:41,859
on and a suit. He's like a

912
01:08:41,859 --> 01:08:43,859
board room table with like a pencil and

913
01:08:43,859 --> 01:08:47,579
a paper and he just doesn't know what he's

914
01:08:47,579 --> 01:08:51,539
doing and it's just so cute. Okay, showers.

915
01:08:51,539 --> 01:09:06,819
Okay. Maybe one sink.

916
01:09:06,819 --> 01:09:11,220
One more towel rack. That's better.

917
01:09:11,220 --> 01:09:13,909
Okay, good. Complete it. There we go.

918
01:09:13,909 --> 01:09:18,140
Much cleaner. Much

919
01:09:18,140 --> 01:09:22,619
cleaner. And then there's enough room in the hallway,

920
01:09:22,619 --> 01:09:25,500
right? Okay. Because then this will be

921
01:09:25,500 --> 01:09:27,500
an activity kind of area for the students,

922
01:09:27,500 --> 01:09:33,430
right? Campus building. Student

923
01:09:33,430 --> 01:09:35,430
lounge. Yep. Okay. Student lounge.

924
01:09:35,430 --> 01:09:48,579
Shit. No, it's okay. It's alright.

925
01:09:48,579 --> 01:09:54,649
There's enough room. There's enough room. Yeah, we're fine.

926
01:09:54,649 --> 01:10:02,710
Alright, that's good. Maybe two couches.

927
01:10:02,710 --> 01:10:10,760
A little game table.

928
01:10:10,760 --> 01:10:13,899
Microwavable snacks. Like a sink to

929
01:10:13,899 --> 01:10:17,609
wash your hands. Arcade machines.

930
01:10:17,609 --> 01:10:32,899
I almost did it.

931
01:10:39,340 --> 01:10:41,340
There are TVs.

932
01:10:43,340 --> 01:10:45,770
There's no TVs.

933
01:10:58,170 --> 01:11:02,779
That was good. Alright, on the count of three, I want you to

934
01:11:02,779 --> 01:11:05,850
let them out of emote only. On the count of three.

935
01:11:05,850 --> 01:11:09,109
Let them out of emote only on the count of three.

936
01:11:09,109 --> 01:11:11,989
And I'm going to sit here silently.

937
01:11:11,989 --> 01:11:15,000
And if I'm not happy, it's going back. One, two, three, go.

938
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:31,180
I'm happy.

939
01:11:31,180 --> 01:11:33,989
Is that too much? The one clown

940
01:11:33,989 --> 01:11:36,739
trunk? Costume area?

941
01:11:36,739 --> 01:11:38,739
Yeah. Alright, this is fun.

942
01:11:38,739 --> 01:11:41,369
Maybe another chair in the middle or something.

943
01:11:41,369 --> 01:11:46,149
Dartboard over here, too? Yeah, dartboard.

944
01:11:46,149 --> 01:11:51,060
Maybe

945
01:11:51,060 --> 01:11:53,060
somebody's to watch

946
01:11:53,060 --> 01:11:57,479
people just sit here.

947
01:11:57,479 --> 01:11:59,479
Do you want to have a little hangout

948
01:11:59,479 --> 01:12:02,869
in this couch area?

949
01:12:02,869 --> 01:12:04,869
Yeah, like a place to lounge and have

950
01:12:04,869 --> 01:12:07,369
a snack together. Yeah, that's fine.

951
01:12:07,369 --> 01:12:11,779
Alright, we're done. This one's perfect.

952
01:12:11,779 --> 01:12:13,779
Alright, so this is the student hangout zone.

953
01:12:13,779 --> 01:12:18,180
Student hangout zone looks good.

954
01:12:18,180 --> 01:12:25,460
Now let me remove it from over here.

955
01:12:25,460 --> 01:12:27,460
They're all here. Well, they'll figure it out.

956
01:12:27,460 --> 01:12:36,979
I should probably keep the bathroom.

957
01:12:36,979 --> 01:12:38,979
So you don't have to go all the way back to the student

958
01:12:38,979 --> 01:12:41,800
lounge to go to the bathroom?

959
01:12:41,800 --> 01:12:45,239
What? That's fine. Okay.

960
01:12:45,239 --> 01:12:47,239
This has got to move, too. This is

961
01:12:47,239 --> 01:12:55,930
annoying in the way. Can I pick it up?

962
01:12:55,930 --> 01:13:00,979
Let's make a new one. I'll make a new one of these, too.

963
01:13:00,979 --> 01:13:05,899
Wait, if I delete this, I'll lose

964
01:13:05,899 --> 01:13:12,020
the prestige, right?

965
01:13:12,020 --> 01:13:14,840
That's actually a bad idea. That's a really bad idea,

966
01:13:14,840 --> 01:13:26,920
isn't it? Yeah.

967
01:13:26,920 --> 01:13:29,609
One person just goes, yeah.

968
01:13:29,609 --> 01:13:32,420
Y-E. And to see

969
01:13:32,420 --> 01:13:34,420
if people are getting just banned and timed

970
01:13:34,420 --> 01:13:40,550
out. Yeah. Yeah.

971
01:13:40,550 --> 01:13:46,699
Thanks for the help. I

972
01:13:46,699 --> 01:13:49,189
appreciate it, man. Alright, so

973
01:13:49,189 --> 01:13:51,189
I'm gonna just expand it.

974
01:13:51,189 --> 01:13:58,460
It can stay here. Yeah.

975
01:13:58,460 --> 01:14:03,619
Ooh. Okay, wait. I need to

976
01:14:03,619 --> 01:14:08,090
edit the room. Pick up room, edit

977
01:14:08,090 --> 01:14:10,090
room. Alright, here we go. Let's add

978
01:14:10,090 --> 01:14:15,779
some wall like that.

979
01:14:15,779 --> 01:14:18,729
Okay.

980
01:14:23,220 --> 01:14:25,220
This can stay over here. I need the other science

981
01:14:25,220 --> 01:14:27,220
equipment, right?

982
01:14:27,220 --> 01:14:29,220
Wait, edit it again.

983
01:14:33,850 --> 01:14:37,819
What is this guy talking

984
01:14:37,819 --> 01:14:45,180
about? Okay, now I need

985
01:14:45,180 --> 01:14:47,180
another piece of equipment in here. Something better.

986
01:14:47,180 --> 01:15:06,739
I need some science equipment. What the

987
01:15:06,739 --> 01:15:10,569
fuck is that? Um, how do I find

988
01:15:10,569 --> 01:15:18,630
it? Where's the science room stuff?

989
01:15:18,630 --> 01:15:23,930
Oh, here we go. Okay. I don't have enough to do

990
01:15:23,930 --> 01:15:25,930
that, but I can make the room better, right?

991
01:15:25,930 --> 01:15:27,930
So I got a couple of those. It's almost a level

992
01:15:27,930 --> 01:15:31,060
of prestige up. So let's do two of these.

993
01:15:31,060 --> 01:15:33,060
There we go. Science lab level three.

994
01:15:33,060 --> 01:15:37,140
Yes! A couple more whiteboards.

995
01:15:37,140 --> 01:15:42,460
A place to sit down, right?

996
01:15:42,460 --> 01:15:53,510
Is there any desks or anything? Oh,

997
01:15:53,510 --> 01:15:55,750
why would I not? I spent it on

998
01:15:55,750 --> 01:15:58,060
a piñata or whatever the hell it was.

999
01:15:58,060 --> 01:16:09,770
What did I even spend that money on? Okay, that's fine.

1000
01:16:09,770 --> 01:16:13,350
What's wrong with your camera? It's bent.

1001
01:16:13,350 --> 01:16:26,020
Is that a window or did I just take the wall

1002
01:16:26,020 --> 01:16:30,380
away? How are those windows?

1003
01:16:30,380 --> 01:16:38,100
Oh, people really like that. This is

1004
01:16:38,100 --> 01:16:43,720
level five now. Okay.

1005
01:16:43,720 --> 01:16:45,720
Alright, so this place is better. I need like

1006
01:16:45,720 --> 01:16:53,590
chairs or something. I need chairs.

1007
01:16:53,590 --> 01:16:58,699
There we go. It's five, um,

1008
01:16:58,699 --> 01:17:06,359
what are they called? Isn't it suma

1009
01:17:06,359 --> 01:17:12,699
not sume? It is?

1010
01:17:12,699 --> 01:17:15,819
Wait, is it sumo? What did I say?

1011
01:17:15,819 --> 01:17:18,630
Sumekomlade.

1012
01:17:18,630 --> 01:17:24,949
Yeah. Alright, that's good enough.

1013
01:17:24,949 --> 01:17:26,949
I got it leveled up. So that'll be giving

1014
01:17:26,949 --> 01:17:28,949
people better grades now.

1015
01:17:28,949 --> 01:17:31,449
I'm strictly an anti-camera

1016
01:17:31,449 --> 01:17:33,619
kind of guy. I need a lecture hall.

1017
01:17:33,619 --> 01:17:35,619
My philosophy is I can't

1018
01:17:35,619 --> 01:17:37,619
see you, you can't see me.

1019
01:17:37,619 --> 01:17:39,619
Lecture hall will go right in the middle. So I like to

1020
01:17:39,619 --> 01:17:41,619
keep things as low tech as possible.

1021
01:17:41,619 --> 01:17:43,930
I'd recommend strategically

1022
01:17:43,930 --> 01:17:45,930
placed strings

1023
01:17:45,930 --> 01:17:47,930
attached to some bells.

1024
01:17:47,930 --> 01:17:49,930
You hear a ring and you got yourself

1025
01:17:49,930 --> 01:17:51,930
a visitor. Of course,

1026
01:17:51,930 --> 01:17:53,930
sometimes it's the doorbell

1027
01:17:53,930 --> 01:17:55,930
and you really do have a visitor. Alright, what else can I put in here?

1028
01:17:55,930 --> 01:17:57,930
Is it a camera?

1029
01:18:01,930 --> 01:18:03,930
This guy.

1030
01:18:03,930 --> 01:18:05,930
These guys are freaking me out.

1031
01:18:13,899 --> 01:18:16,520
Okay, people like that. Wipe board

1032
01:18:16,520 --> 01:18:20,229
behind you over here.

1033
01:18:20,229 --> 01:18:22,789
Just in case you need like a ton to show a lot of work.

1034
01:18:22,789 --> 01:18:28,939
Trash cans and

1035
01:18:28,939 --> 01:18:32,899
sanitizations. Okay.

1036
01:18:32,899 --> 01:18:36,100
And plants. Looks good.

1037
01:18:36,100 --> 01:18:38,600
Do I have two of these? No.

1038
01:18:38,600 --> 01:18:49,140
Should I? Shit.

1039
01:18:49,140 --> 01:18:53,180
Does that matter? I don't think that

1040
01:18:53,180 --> 01:19:03,100
I don't think this matters. It gave me points.

1041
01:19:03,100 --> 01:19:08,409
What's that? What poll? That's fine. It gave me points.

1042
01:19:08,409 --> 01:19:12,060
I don't care. Alright, that's a lecture hall.

1043
01:19:12,060 --> 01:19:15,060
Now we have to build the other

1044
01:19:15,060 --> 01:19:17,750
room which is the

1045
01:19:17,750 --> 01:19:19,750
VR lab.

1046
01:19:19,750 --> 01:19:22,060
35 grand. Alright, I hope this is worth it.

1047
01:19:22,060 --> 01:19:26,920
I'm thinking over here, right? Like yeah,

1048
01:19:26,920 --> 01:19:33,239
over here. Alright, this is the VR lab.

1049
01:19:33,239 --> 01:19:41,420
Should I make it bigger? Bigger?

1050
01:19:41,420 --> 01:19:50,039
Should I fill this whole thing? Yeah.

1051
01:19:50,039 --> 01:19:53,859
Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

1052
01:19:53,859 --> 01:20:10,869
Yeah.

1053
01:20:10,869 --> 01:20:12,869
Is that too big on this side though? Maybe

1054
01:20:12,869 --> 01:20:14,869
whatever. I don't care. It's fine.

1055
01:20:14,869 --> 01:20:18,069
I hate the way it looks. I hate

1056
01:20:18,069 --> 01:20:43,989
the way it looks. I hate the way this looks.

1057
01:20:43,989 --> 01:20:51,399
Why do I hate this so much? Should I just fill

1058
01:20:51,399 --> 01:20:55,180
the space and just say fuck it? Who cares? I'm just gonna

1059
01:20:55,180 --> 01:21:01,189
whatever. Fill it. It doesn't matter.

1060
01:21:01,189 --> 01:21:05,350
Should I have more than one of these? Okay,

1061
01:21:05,350 --> 01:21:08,869
so this is a VR

1062
01:21:08,869 --> 01:21:12,199
area here. I should probably have more

1063
01:21:12,199 --> 01:21:15,979
than a few of these. This is a VR

1064
01:21:15,979 --> 01:21:17,979
chair. These are

1065
01:21:17,979 --> 01:21:23,289
really expensive.

1066
01:21:25,779 --> 01:21:28,539
Five?

1067
01:21:28,539 --> 01:21:30,539
Okay, I'm gonna do

1068
01:21:30,539 --> 01:21:32,539
five of those and then the VR desk.

1069
01:21:32,539 --> 01:21:40,520
Wait, they need to be in front of them?

1070
01:21:40,520 --> 01:21:45,000
I'll just do this. And then

1071
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:48,970
VR headsets.

1072
01:21:48,970 --> 01:22:02,520
Where do these go? Against the wall here?

1073
01:22:02,520 --> 01:22:05,140
Okay. Hand sanitizer.

1074
01:22:05,140 --> 01:22:09,430
Is that okay? Do I have

1075
01:22:09,430 --> 01:22:18,949
two? I'm gonna do two. And then

1076
01:22:18,949 --> 01:22:35,819
windows. Okay.

1077
01:22:35,819 --> 01:22:44,060
Trash can. Okay. Windows

1078
01:22:44,060 --> 01:22:47,819
in a VR room. Why what?

1079
01:22:47,819 --> 01:22:49,819
What platform is the best to buy Two Point

1080
01:22:49,819 --> 01:22:51,819
Campus on? I'm really glad you brought that

1081
01:22:51,819 --> 01:22:53,819
up, Mons. Let me tell you. You got

1082
01:22:53,819 --> 01:22:55,989
quite a few options here. You've got PlayStation.

1083
01:22:55,989 --> 01:22:57,989
You've got Xbox. You've got

1084
01:22:57,989 --> 01:22:59,989
PC. You've even got

1085
01:22:59,989 --> 01:23:14,840
the, um, you've got it on the Nintendo

1086
01:23:14,840 --> 01:23:16,840
Switch. So you've got a lot of options.

1087
01:23:16,840 --> 01:23:20,550
Pretty much every major platform this is

1088
01:23:20,550 --> 01:23:22,920
available on. It's got

1089
01:23:22,920 --> 01:23:25,159
really cool new abilities. You can

1090
01:23:25,159 --> 01:23:27,159
build in the, for the first time, you can build

1091
01:23:27,159 --> 01:23:29,399
in the great outdoors. You can build outside,

1092
01:23:29,399 --> 01:23:31,829
which is the, uh, you couldn't do that before. Uh,

1093
01:23:31,829 --> 01:23:33,829
if I were to take a pic right now, I would say it's,

1094
01:23:33,829 --> 01:23:35,829
you know, I'm gonna give you a little wild

1095
01:23:35,829 --> 01:23:38,199
card here. I'm gonna say this is probably great

1096
01:23:38,199 --> 01:23:40,199
on the Switch, because you can bring it into the bathroom.

1097
01:23:40,199 --> 01:23:42,760
This place, this is a perfect go to

1098
01:23:42,760 --> 01:23:44,939
the bathroom game, I think, if I'm gonna be really

1099
01:23:44,939 --> 01:23:47,939
honest with you. I can see myself playing this in the bathroom.

1100
01:23:47,939 --> 01:23:54,460
The Switch lets you do that. What

1101
01:23:54,460 --> 01:23:56,819
is he looking out the window for? Alright, that

1102
01:23:56,819 --> 01:24:01,930
looks good. Maybe some,

1103
01:24:01,930 --> 01:24:08,390
maybe this is too big. Here's a question

1104
01:24:08,390 --> 01:24:12,100
from Gyro. What is some

1105
01:24:12,100 --> 01:24:14,100
of your favorite panic room past

1106
01:24:14,100 --> 01:24:16,100
times? This guy with the panic rooms.

1107
01:24:16,100 --> 01:24:18,100
What is this, this guy,

1108
01:24:18,100 --> 01:24:20,100
this guy. I find that you can have a lot of

1109
01:24:20,100 --> 01:24:22,100
fun with a little bouncing wall. This guy has

1110
01:24:22,100 --> 01:24:24,100
one piece of content. In fact,

1111
01:24:24,100 --> 01:24:26,279
one time I was bouncing,

1112
01:24:26,279 --> 01:24:28,279
lost track of time, and it turned

1113
01:24:28,279 --> 01:24:30,279
out that I've been doing it for 16 hours. I think we're ready to start the next year.

1114
01:24:30,279 --> 01:24:32,649
I went cold turkey

1115
01:24:32,649 --> 01:24:34,890
after that, meaning I was hungry. So we've got

1116
01:24:34,890 --> 01:24:36,890
the library still. Should I put the library in the

1117
01:24:36,890 --> 01:24:39,579
student hall? That might make more sense

1118
01:24:39,579 --> 01:24:45,590
over here. What do you think? Library

1119
01:24:45,590 --> 01:24:47,590
in the academic building or library

1120
01:24:47,590 --> 01:24:49,590
in the student area?

1121
01:24:49,590 --> 01:24:55,399
Yeah? Yeah? What?

1122
01:24:55,399 --> 01:25:05,699
Nah. I don't know what just happened but it's gone.

1123
01:25:05,699 --> 01:25:08,649
Okay, thank goodness.

1124
01:25:08,649 --> 01:25:22,260
Stop. I'm going to put the library here

1125
01:25:22,260 --> 01:25:30,329
where the students are. Wait, oh

1126
01:25:30,329 --> 01:25:32,329
no, this is the staff room. I don't want this over here.

1127
01:25:32,329 --> 01:25:46,020
Okay, keep it there. This is the library.

1128
01:25:46,020 --> 01:25:52,920
I need two lecture theaters?

1129
01:25:52,920 --> 01:26:07,960
Oh, that's not good. Okay, I

1130
01:26:07,960 --> 01:26:10,779
need another one of these. I need another

1131
01:26:10,779 --> 01:26:20,819
receptionist here. This room is way

1132
01:26:20,819 --> 01:26:45,960
freaking small. Salad.

1133
01:26:45,960 --> 01:26:53,560
Computer desk? Yep, we need

1134
01:26:53,560 --> 01:26:59,369
computers. Maybe two of these?

1135
01:26:59,369 --> 01:27:01,539
Make a meth lab.

1136
01:27:01,539 --> 01:27:04,939
That's not happening.

1137
01:27:04,939 --> 01:27:08,060
Alright, some more books? Okay.

1138
01:27:08,060 --> 01:27:10,060
This is now a true, this is a library now.

1139
01:27:10,060 --> 01:27:20,869
The room has the same painting. Alright.

1140
01:27:20,869 --> 01:27:23,500
That's much better. I do

1141
01:27:23,500 --> 01:27:25,500
need two people working here now.

1142
01:27:25,500 --> 01:27:28,439
Yeah? Okay, I need two people working

1143
01:27:28,439 --> 01:27:31,510
there. That's good. That

1144
01:27:31,510 --> 01:27:33,510
meeeeeeeeeeeeeee

1145
01:27:33,510 --> 01:27:35,510
I just froze. My brain just

1146
01:27:35,510 --> 01:27:41,529
turned off. The lecture hall, they have to be

1147
01:27:41,529 --> 01:27:47,539
back to back over here.

1148
01:27:51,189 --> 01:28:00,220
One step ahead, sneaky getaway.

1149
01:28:00,220 --> 01:28:02,899
Couldn't install your panic room

1150
01:28:02,899 --> 01:28:05,140
in a hall of mirrors.

1151
01:28:05,140 --> 01:28:08,020
Or, get signed on the door that

1152
01:28:08,020 --> 01:28:10,020
says, out for lunch.

1153
01:28:10,020 --> 01:28:12,649
This place is way too big.

1154
01:28:12,649 --> 01:28:14,649
It's massive. It doesn't need to be

1155
01:28:14,649 --> 01:28:19,060
this big at all. Let's

1156
01:28:19,060 --> 01:28:39,020
close it up a little. Salad.

1157
01:28:39,020 --> 01:28:51,399
Salad. Salad. Salad.

1158
01:28:51,399 --> 01:28:57,340
Salad. Salad. Salad.

1159
01:28:57,340 --> 01:29:16,060
Salad. Salad. Salad.

1160
01:29:16,060 --> 01:29:28,060
How do I do it? How do I sell this?

1161
01:29:28,060 --> 01:29:30,060
Is your camera on 120 FOV? I don't

1162
01:29:30,060 --> 01:29:34,649
think so. How do I sell it? Subtract,

1163
01:29:34,649 --> 01:29:42,760
right? Yes. How do I do it? Which

1164
01:29:42,760 --> 01:29:46,789
pizza is the best? What's going on?

1165
01:29:46,789 --> 01:29:49,420
This is so wrong. Meat pizza sucks.

1166
01:29:49,420 --> 01:29:53,640
If you say that meat,

1167
01:29:53,640 --> 01:29:55,640
like meat pizza, I'm imagining

1168
01:29:55,640 --> 01:29:59,989
meat time is meat lover's pizza. Wait,

1169
01:29:59,989 --> 01:30:01,989
it costs money to vote on this poll. I was

1170
01:30:01,989 --> 01:30:06,279
wait, what? No, I'm not wrong. I'm not wrong.

1171
01:30:06,279 --> 01:30:09,399
Let me tell you something. Listen to me.

1172
01:30:09,399 --> 01:30:11,399
Pepperoni is amazing on pizza. Sausage

1173
01:30:11,399 --> 01:30:13,399
is amazing on pizza. Hamburger is amazing

1174
01:30:13,399 --> 01:30:17,220
on pizza.

1175
01:30:17,220 --> 01:30:19,220
Turkey or whatever. I don't know. Whatever

1176
01:30:19,220 --> 01:30:22,039
weird shit. Chicken is amazing on pizza.

1177
01:30:22,039 --> 01:30:24,039
But when you put them all on it at the same

1178
01:30:24,039 --> 01:30:26,039
time, it ruins everything.

1179
01:30:26,039 --> 01:30:30,069
It just becomes a fucking lasagna. You can't

1180
01:30:30,069 --> 01:30:32,069
you pick it up. You try to pick a piece of

1181
01:30:32,069 --> 01:30:34,310
meat lover's pizza up. It falls apart.

1182
01:30:34,310 --> 01:30:37,449
It goes everywhere. It's not even a piece

1183
01:30:37,449 --> 01:30:40,970
of pizza anymore. It's just annoying. I'm of

1184
01:30:40,970 --> 01:30:42,970
the opinion, and you guys can tell me if I'm wrong here, but that's fine.

1185
01:30:42,970 --> 01:30:45,270
It doesn't bother me. I don't think

1186
01:30:45,270 --> 01:30:47,270
there should ever be more than two toppings on a pizza

1187
01:30:47,270 --> 01:30:50,460
ever. Ever. For any reason.

1188
01:30:50,460 --> 01:30:52,460
When you put more than two toppings on a

1189
01:30:52,460 --> 01:30:54,460
pizza, it weighs down to a point

1190
01:30:54,460 --> 01:30:56,460
where it cannot be eaten anymore the way that pizza

1191
01:30:56,460 --> 01:30:58,460
is. At that point, it's not a pizza. It's a casserole.

1192
01:30:58,460 --> 01:31:01,659
Three maybe. Depends on what it is.

1193
01:31:01,659 --> 01:31:04,220
If you...

1194
01:31:04,220 --> 01:31:06,220
This fucking

1195
01:31:06,220 --> 01:31:08,220
panic room guy.

1196
01:31:08,220 --> 01:31:10,220
I need to quiet him while

1197
01:31:10,220 --> 01:31:12,220
I'm talking for a second.

1198
01:31:12,220 --> 01:31:14,390
Where is...

1199
01:31:14,390 --> 01:31:19,189
I feel like this is TTS

1200
01:31:19,189 --> 01:31:21,189
donations and you guys are on this

1201
01:31:21,189 --> 01:31:23,819
panic room meme. Okay.

1202
01:31:23,819 --> 01:31:28,600
So anyways, what the hell is just

1203
01:31:28,600 --> 01:31:33,779
coming out of my mouth? What were we talking about?

1204
01:31:33,779 --> 01:31:36,149
No, we're not talking about panic rooms.

1205
01:31:36,149 --> 01:31:38,149
We're talking about pizza.

1206
01:31:38,149 --> 01:31:41,670
We're talking about pizza.

1207
01:31:41,670 --> 01:31:44,739
Okay. That guy's wicked funny.

1208
01:31:44,739 --> 01:31:46,739
But not at the

1209
01:31:46,739 --> 01:31:49,560
exact moment when I'm talking about pizza.

1210
01:31:49,560 --> 01:31:52,180
Pepperoni. Like, okay, if you have like

1211
01:31:52,180 --> 01:31:54,180
mushrooms, onions, and peppers,

1212
01:31:54,180 --> 01:31:56,489
that's three items.

1213
01:31:56,489 --> 01:31:58,920
That's fine. Pepperoni, like

1214
01:31:58,920 --> 01:32:00,920
garlic and onion, that's fine.

1215
01:32:00,920 --> 01:32:02,920
Anything more than two or three and you just

1216
01:32:02,920 --> 01:32:05,479
come on. Just, you might as

1217
01:32:05,479 --> 01:32:13,800
well just make a lasagna. Seriously.

1218
01:32:13,800 --> 01:32:16,039
Items, small items are fine.

1219
01:32:16,039 --> 01:32:18,039
But more than three or four, it starts to become

1220
01:32:18,039 --> 01:32:22,899
too much for me. Garlic on pizza? Have you never

1221
01:32:22,899 --> 01:32:28,470
had garlic on pizza? Garlic and onion pizza.

1222
01:32:28,470 --> 01:32:30,470
Wait, you've never had garlic and onion pizza? What are you talking about?

1223
01:32:30,470 --> 01:32:35,189
That's kind of crazy. It's amazing.

1224
01:32:35,189 --> 01:32:38,840
You're going to ewe garlic.

1225
01:32:38,840 --> 01:32:40,840
I don't even listen

1226
01:32:40,840 --> 01:32:44,420
to that. Okay. So let me

1227
01:32:44,420 --> 01:32:48,710
try this again. Alright. Subtract.

1228
01:32:48,710 --> 01:32:58,420
How do I actually subtract it though?

1229
01:32:58,420 --> 01:33:09,180
Do I need to have this in here?

1230
01:33:09,180 --> 01:33:14,039
Invalid wall. Oh, okay.

1231
01:33:14,039 --> 01:33:17,500
You have to actually complete the room. I get it.

1232
01:33:17,500 --> 01:33:23,130
Oh yeah, it did not need to be that big.

1233
01:33:23,130 --> 01:33:25,130
So that's fine. Okay. So now I need a second one

1234
01:33:25,130 --> 01:33:29,609
of these. Sorry students,

1235
01:33:29,609 --> 01:33:36,119
you're going to have to move immediately.

1236
01:33:36,119 --> 01:33:38,119
I was going to say, what the hell have I done? That's fine.

1237
01:33:38,119 --> 01:33:45,720
Okay. Wait. That's

1238
01:33:45,720 --> 01:33:56,340
probably not a great idea.

1239
01:33:56,340 --> 01:33:59,609
Okay. I'm going to extend the bathroom a little bit.

1240
01:33:59,609 --> 01:34:14,630
Okay, that's fine. Now

1241
01:34:14,630 --> 01:34:16,939
I've got, I need a second

1242
01:34:16,939 --> 01:34:18,939
lecture hall, which is going to have to go down here.

1243
01:34:18,939 --> 01:34:22,310
Or maybe it could go here. Yeah, it could go here.

1244
01:34:22,310 --> 01:34:31,380
Under the door. No!

1245
01:34:31,380 --> 01:34:33,380
Okay, that's fine. And I'm going to take this

1246
01:34:33,380 --> 01:34:35,380
edge here. And the other lecture hall will go right here.

1247
01:34:35,380 --> 01:34:45,289
That's perfect. Much better.

1248
01:34:45,289 --> 01:34:51,420
Let's even this out. There's some shit in the way.

1249
01:34:51,420 --> 01:34:53,420
Look at this stupid hand sanitizer out here.

1250
01:34:53,420 --> 01:35:11,140
What are you doing? Alright, that's good.

1251
01:35:11,140 --> 01:35:26,819
I need a second one here. Oh, it's because of this door.

1252
01:35:26,819 --> 01:35:44,020
That's good. Okay, cool.

1253
01:35:44,020 --> 01:35:47,779
This is fun. Okay.

1254
01:35:47,779 --> 01:35:49,779
I'm going to get a ton of, they're going to get good grades.

1255
01:35:49,779 --> 01:35:55,210
Alright, here's another lecture theater.

1256
01:35:55,210 --> 01:35:59,109
This is lecture theater two. There it is.

1257
01:35:59,109 --> 01:36:02,939
Done. There we go. Alright.

1258
01:36:02,939 --> 01:36:05,880
Yeah!

1259
01:36:05,880 --> 01:36:12,340
I think I'm ready to start the year. Un-mirror the

1260
01:36:12,340 --> 01:36:14,340
thing. You look like an uncanny troll face.

1261
01:36:14,340 --> 01:36:19,779
You have to get over it.

1262
01:36:19,779 --> 01:36:21,779
Okay, let's hire some extra staff.

1263
01:36:21,779 --> 01:36:25,420
So we need a VR...

1264
01:36:25,420 --> 01:36:29,880
What's the difference between you two?

1265
01:36:29,880 --> 01:36:31,880
Moves faster than normal. Excellent personal hygiene.

1266
01:36:31,880 --> 01:36:34,890
Gets hungry easily. Gets thirsty

1267
01:36:34,890 --> 01:36:39,800
easily. You're fine. So we need

1268
01:36:39,800 --> 01:36:42,100
a VR technician.

1269
01:36:42,100 --> 01:36:47,079
We need... Should I get another

1270
01:36:47,079 --> 01:36:49,079
science teacher? Do we only have...

1271
01:36:49,079 --> 01:36:52,149
We already have one. Aerodynamics?

1272
01:36:52,149 --> 01:36:58,300
I definitely need another... Okay, I need a

1273
01:36:58,300 --> 01:37:00,600
library assistant. Yeah,

1274
01:37:00,600 --> 01:37:05,270
okay, you're good. Okay, so that's two

1275
01:37:05,270 --> 01:37:07,640
and then maybe one more janitor. I don't want to lose

1276
01:37:07,640 --> 01:37:10,199
I don't want to blow my money. Your head looks

1277
01:37:10,199 --> 01:37:22,550
like a slice of pizza. Alright, now what I need

1278
01:37:22,550 --> 01:37:27,420
to make this look a little nicer.

1279
01:37:27,420 --> 01:37:32,409
This is so barren out here.

1280
01:37:32,409 --> 01:37:35,479
What are the needs? Table, football,

1281
01:37:35,479 --> 01:37:37,850
wanted. I need a hundred coins.

1282
01:37:37,850 --> 01:37:40,279
Tree bench. I need a hundred coins.

1283
01:37:40,279 --> 01:37:44,100
Can't do it right now. I'm sorry.

1284
01:37:44,100 --> 01:37:46,100
Table, football, tree bench. I don't

1285
01:37:46,100 --> 01:37:54,340
have it. Alright, well, I gotta put like

1286
01:37:54,340 --> 01:37:56,340
some cool decorations.

1287
01:37:56,340 --> 01:38:03,750
How about this one? And then... What's this?

1288
01:38:03,750 --> 01:38:24,090
Oh, a fountain. I don't want to overdo

1289
01:38:24,090 --> 01:38:32,409
it. Seating like right outside. This is like

1290
01:38:32,409 --> 01:38:39,189
a good place to have it. That looks good.

1291
01:38:39,189 --> 01:38:44,869
That looks great. This is shitload of items.

1292
01:38:44,869 --> 01:38:49,659
There's actually a lot. Okay. What's this?

1293
01:38:49,659 --> 01:38:52,149
Paths and terrain.

1294
01:38:52,149 --> 01:38:55,340
Oh, okay. Alright.

1295
01:38:55,340 --> 01:39:00,460
Manage courses. I think we're ready.

1296
01:39:00,460 --> 01:39:07,029
Ready to go? Should I have some seating in here?

1297
01:39:07,029 --> 01:39:11,640
Alright, I can't even put... Wait, what about sofa?

1298
01:39:11,640 --> 01:39:16,739
Couch. Let's go.

1299
01:39:16,739 --> 01:39:25,579
It's time to start the academic year.

1300
01:39:25,579 --> 01:39:29,029
What am I doing wrong here?

1301
01:39:29,029 --> 01:39:38,420
Here we go. Are you sure you want to start

1302
01:39:38,420 --> 01:39:41,300
the year with the following courses?

1303
01:39:41,300 --> 01:39:48,020
Yes. Oh!

1304
01:39:48,020 --> 01:39:50,020
What is... Okay, it's literally... Alright.

1305
01:39:50,020 --> 01:39:52,020
That... What the fuck is that?

1306
01:39:52,020 --> 01:39:54,020
And why is it floating around the light?

1307
01:39:54,020 --> 01:39:58,890
I just got scared by like a hair.

1308
01:39:58,890 --> 01:40:04,649
There was this big dust bunny that was

1309
01:40:04,649 --> 01:40:06,649
floating around and it like got attracted to the ring light.

1310
01:40:06,649 --> 01:40:09,079
At least I think that's what that was.

1311
01:40:09,079 --> 01:40:37,859
Can you see this?

1312
01:40:37,859 --> 01:40:39,859
That floated up into the light and

1313
01:40:39,859 --> 01:40:43,130
casted a shadow. And it was

1314
01:40:43,130 --> 01:40:45,130
horrifying. I thought I was

1315
01:40:45,130 --> 01:40:51,529
getting attacked by an insect. It's just

1316
01:40:51,529 --> 01:40:53,529
dust. Yeah, I know, but it floated by the ring light

1317
01:40:53,529 --> 01:40:55,529
and casted this massive

1318
01:40:55,529 --> 01:40:59,430
shadow. You made a Lord Voldemort

1319
01:40:59,430 --> 01:41:01,430
sound.

1320
01:41:01,430 --> 01:41:11,529
Alright, new year, let's do it.

1321
01:41:11,529 --> 01:41:14,340
Welcome students. We've got more

1322
01:41:14,340 --> 01:41:17,609
classes here. We've got a nice

1323
01:41:17,609 --> 01:41:20,359
place to hang out. We've also got...

1324
01:41:20,359 --> 01:41:23,939
That's cheating.

1325
01:41:23,939 --> 01:41:33,460
Let's go to the toilet.

1326
01:41:37,460 --> 01:41:40,520
Alright.

1327
01:41:40,520 --> 01:41:42,520
We have a relationship forming between

1328
01:41:42,520 --> 01:41:44,520
The academic year is starting.

1329
01:41:44,520 --> 01:41:46,520
Wolfric Halfmoon

1330
01:41:46,520 --> 01:41:49,659
and

1331
01:41:49,659 --> 01:41:51,659
Randy Fenderson.

1332
01:41:51,659 --> 01:41:55,859
Students, virtual normality.

1333
01:41:55,859 --> 01:42:00,729
I think I can only have 20

1334
01:42:00,729 --> 01:42:07,000
students. Alright, come check out the

1335
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:09,000
dorm room, man. It's pretty sick.

1336
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:11,560
Yeah, I remember Benny Bungle from year

1337
01:42:11,560 --> 01:42:16,100
one. Yeah, trying the hats, man.

1338
01:42:16,100 --> 01:42:18,729
Check out the clown trunk too

1339
01:42:18,729 --> 01:42:23,909
when you have a chance. There are way

1340
01:42:23,909 --> 01:42:25,909
too many students. We only have two classes.

1341
01:42:25,909 --> 01:42:30,460
Two students have a

1342
01:42:30,460 --> 01:42:32,460
personal goal of wanting to sit on a park

1343
01:42:32,460 --> 01:42:39,930
bench. I mean,

1344
01:42:39,930 --> 01:42:47,289
really? That's a

1345
01:42:47,289 --> 01:42:49,289
goal of yours is to sit on a park bench.

1346
01:42:49,289 --> 01:42:52,939
I mean, I'm not going to deny you that. That's

1347
01:42:52,939 --> 01:42:54,939
fine.

1348
01:42:54,939 --> 01:42:56,939
Here, go

1349
01:42:56,939 --> 01:42:59,819
fulfill your greatest

1350
01:42:59,819 --> 01:43:04,869
desire. Where are the teachers?

1351
01:43:04,869 --> 01:43:13,829
What's wrong?

1352
01:43:13,829 --> 01:43:16,460
Learning rate, 118%

1353
01:43:16,460 --> 01:43:18,460
textbook cubicle required.

1354
01:43:18,460 --> 01:43:20,760
Get to class, hurry up.

1355
01:43:20,760 --> 01:43:24,090
Wait, Benny, the teacher.

1356
01:43:24,090 --> 01:43:26,090
Oh, the students are in here unsupervised.

1357
01:43:26,090 --> 01:43:31,659
How many teachers do I have?

1358
01:43:31,659 --> 01:43:35,750
Jerma, the VR students are making

1359
01:43:35,750 --> 01:43:37,750
porn. You have to stop them.

1360
01:43:37,750 --> 01:43:54,579
Students are asked not to ask questions.

1361
01:43:54,579 --> 01:43:56,579
Oh, you got an intelligence

1362
01:43:56,579 --> 01:43:58,579
boost. They're definitely going to end up

1363
01:43:58,579 --> 01:44:03,189
with a C, right? Uh oh.

1364
01:44:03,189 --> 01:44:10,539
There's only 10 room capacity.

1365
01:44:10,539 --> 01:44:15,140
One, two, three, four, five, six,

1366
01:44:15,140 --> 01:44:17,140
seven, eight, nine, ten. Yo,

1367
01:44:17,140 --> 01:44:19,140
how do I add more people?

1368
01:44:19,140 --> 01:44:22,920
You're doing a

1369
01:44:22,920 --> 01:44:24,920
broom on the sofa?

1370
01:44:24,920 --> 01:44:33,050
I thought that, did you see that fly by the

1371
01:44:33,050 --> 01:44:35,050
screen? Did you see it? You saw that,

1372
01:44:35,050 --> 01:44:39,380
right? Make the room bigger.

1373
01:44:39,380 --> 01:44:48,020
Nobody's going to the library. They're all just

1374
01:44:48,020 --> 01:44:50,020
goofing off in the hangout room.

1375
01:44:50,020 --> 01:44:59,750
You could hear a pin drop.

1376
01:45:01,750 --> 01:45:03,750
Look at this.

1377
01:45:03,750 --> 01:45:06,180
Look at this. Come on.

1378
01:45:06,180 --> 01:45:08,489
No one wants to study.

1379
01:45:08,489 --> 01:45:13,989
Oh my goodness.

1380
01:45:13,989 --> 01:45:19,930
Hot dog kiosk?

1381
01:45:19,930 --> 01:45:21,930
This might be frightfully exciting for you. The people of

1382
01:45:21,930 --> 01:45:23,930
Freshly now have a second thing to be proud of.

1383
01:45:23,930 --> 01:45:26,939
Congratulations and so on.

1384
01:45:26,939 --> 01:45:28,939
Don't be too complacent. This is your first campus

1385
01:45:28,939 --> 01:45:30,939
and it shows.

1386
01:45:30,939 --> 01:45:32,939
Alright, I have a new, I can do a new college.

1387
01:45:32,939 --> 01:45:38,380
I unlocked a hot dog machine.

1388
01:45:38,380 --> 01:45:45,609
So we're the,

1389
01:45:45,609 --> 01:45:54,819
we got that from a different campus.

1390
01:45:54,819 --> 01:45:56,819
Alright, no more like just potato chips

1391
01:45:56,819 --> 01:45:58,819
and sodas.

1392
01:46:03,689 --> 01:46:10,539
Could this be outside?

1393
01:46:10,539 --> 01:46:12,539
Maybe this shouldn't be inside here.

1394
01:46:12,539 --> 01:46:20,279
That would actually be amazing though.

1395
01:46:20,279 --> 01:46:24,380
Do you know? Okay, somebody confirm this to me.

1396
01:46:24,380 --> 01:46:26,619
I've heard

1397
01:46:26,619 --> 01:46:28,619
just randomly through

1398
01:46:28,619 --> 01:46:30,619
various people and stuff.

1399
01:46:30,619 --> 01:46:32,619
Has any of you guys ever heard of this?

1400
01:46:32,619 --> 01:46:34,619
Of like a restaurant being in your school?

1401
01:46:34,619 --> 01:46:37,050
Like a McDonald's?

1402
01:46:37,050 --> 01:46:39,050
Or like a fast food place?

1403
01:46:39,050 --> 01:46:41,930
Being like in the school?

1404
01:46:41,930 --> 01:46:45,770
Or like a Starbucks or something?

1405
01:46:45,770 --> 01:46:47,770
Yes, that happens. A subway. We had a subway.

1406
01:46:47,770 --> 01:46:51,670
We had a subway.

1407
01:46:51,670 --> 01:46:57,029
If there was like a

1408
01:46:57,029 --> 01:46:59,029
McDonald's in between the science room

1409
01:46:59,029 --> 01:47:01,029
and the math room, I would have been there all the time.

1410
01:47:01,029 --> 01:47:03,210
There's a Dunkin' Donuts here.

1411
01:47:03,210 --> 01:47:08,630
Really?

1412
01:47:08,630 --> 01:47:10,630
That sounds amazing.

1413
01:47:10,630 --> 01:47:12,630
We had a deli but not a brand name.

1414
01:47:12,630 --> 01:47:14,630
We had a Taco Bell, Wendy's, Arby's, Dunkin' and a Panera.

1415
01:47:14,630 --> 01:47:16,630
That sounds incredible.

1416
01:47:16,630 --> 01:47:20,149
So you tell me, you could like go out of

1417
01:47:20,149 --> 01:47:22,149
your logic class

1418
01:47:22,149 --> 01:47:24,149
and they would just be a Starbucks

1419
01:47:24,149 --> 01:47:26,149
in the fucking building

1420
01:47:26,149 --> 01:47:36,840
right there.

1421
01:47:36,840 --> 01:47:39,720
In College Univer- yeah.

1422
01:47:39,720 --> 01:47:41,720
That sounds amazing. It's a separate building?

1423
01:47:41,720 --> 01:47:48,500
How far though?

1424
01:47:48,500 --> 01:47:53,180
Corporate takeover.

1425
01:47:53,180 --> 01:47:55,180
Bro, just walk to the fast food.

1426
01:47:55,180 --> 01:47:57,180
But how convenient is that?

1427
01:47:57,180 --> 01:47:59,180
If I can walk out of the lecture hall

1428
01:47:59,180 --> 01:48:01,180
and there's just a Burger King here.

1429
01:48:01,180 --> 01:48:03,979
It's just like-

1430
01:48:03,979 --> 01:48:05,979
Alright, I'm getting a number two.

1431
01:48:05,979 --> 01:48:07,979
Let's go. I'm ready.

1432
01:48:07,979 --> 01:48:12,010
That would be so awesome.

1433
01:48:12,010 --> 01:48:14,310
I would have become such a fat- fuck.

1434
01:48:14,310 --> 01:48:17,770
I really would have been.

1435
01:48:17,770 --> 01:48:20,579
We had a Papa John's in the cafeteria.

1436
01:48:20,579 --> 01:48:25,689
That's so unfair.

1437
01:48:25,689 --> 01:48:28,180
We had a food court.

1438
01:48:28,180 --> 01:48:30,180
Yeah, that would be amazing.

1439
01:48:30,180 --> 01:48:32,180
If there was like three or four different restaurants

1440
01:48:32,180 --> 01:48:38,250
in the campus hall, what happened to you?

1441
01:48:38,250 --> 01:48:43,300
You just did something cool. What did you do?

1442
01:48:43,300 --> 01:48:46,949
Good grades?

1443
01:48:46,949 --> 01:48:51,239
Friends with Charlie Leotard.

1444
01:48:51,239 --> 01:48:57,319
Alright, they're friends.

1445
01:48:57,319 --> 01:48:59,319
Maybe it was a bad idea to have

1446
01:48:59,319 --> 01:49:01,319
the fucking hot dog kiosk.

1447
01:49:01,319 --> 01:49:03,319
Nobody's doing well.

1448
01:49:03,319 --> 01:49:06,579
He's holding his ass.

1449
01:49:06,579 --> 01:49:08,579
Oh, no, no, no.

1450
01:49:08,579 --> 01:49:11,460
He's walking like this.

1451
01:49:11,460 --> 01:49:13,699
He's holding his ass.

1452
01:49:13,699 --> 01:49:15,699
They all have stomachaches and they're gonna shit their pants.

1453
01:49:20,250 --> 01:49:22,250
Now everybody wants to go into the library.

1454
01:49:22,250 --> 01:49:24,250
Oh, wait a minute.

1455
01:49:26,250 --> 01:49:28,619
Oh, no.

1456
01:49:28,619 --> 01:49:32,779
What do I do?

1457
01:49:32,779 --> 01:49:36,489
There's too many people.

1458
01:49:36,489 --> 01:49:38,489
You're either gonna study or you're gonna get up.

1459
01:49:38,489 --> 01:49:40,489
Don't sleep.

1460
01:49:40,489 --> 01:49:42,489
Sleep in your bed.

1461
01:49:44,979 --> 01:49:46,979
No, don't sleep. Get up.

1462
01:49:46,979 --> 01:49:51,979
You've been expelled.

1463
01:50:05,739 --> 01:50:15,210
No.

1464
01:50:15,210 --> 01:50:17,210
What, a dictator? No, dude.

1465
01:50:17,210 --> 01:50:24,819
It's not enough room.

1466
01:50:24,819 --> 01:50:27,899
They're crying.

1467
01:50:27,899 --> 01:50:29,899
Wait, do I have coins? No?

1468
01:50:29,899 --> 01:50:39,180
I do. Okay, I got 200 coins.

1469
01:50:39,180 --> 01:50:41,539
Tree bench.

1470
01:50:41,539 --> 01:50:43,539
Why do you guys want benches so bad?

1471
01:50:43,539 --> 01:50:45,539
The most boring shit.

1472
01:50:45,539 --> 01:50:48,039
Ask for like a pinball machine.

1473
01:50:48,039 --> 01:50:51,819
I really would love a bench.

1474
01:50:51,819 --> 01:50:53,819
What do you mean a bench?

1475
01:50:53,819 --> 01:50:55,819
Ask for like a dozen pinball machines.

1476
01:50:55,819 --> 01:51:00,300
Ask for a McDonald's across from the campus.

1477
01:51:00,300 --> 01:51:03,500
Look, we have plenty of benches.

1478
01:51:03,500 --> 01:51:07,500
I count one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

1479
01:51:07,500 --> 01:51:12,869
Why do you want another bench?

1480
01:51:12,869 --> 01:51:14,869
Please put a bench, please.

1481
01:51:14,869 --> 01:51:18,970
It's $4,000.

1482
01:51:18,970 --> 01:51:20,970
Oh, wait, this is like a romantic bench.

1483
01:51:20,970 --> 01:51:31,460
All right, let's put it like here.

1484
01:51:31,460 --> 01:51:38,810
Who's gonna use it?

1485
01:51:38,810 --> 01:51:40,810
Develop romances, dating, sweethearts.

1486
01:51:40,810 --> 01:51:43,180
All right, there we go.

1487
01:51:43,180 --> 01:51:49,319
Somebody's like, wait, we want this

1488
01:51:49,319 --> 01:51:51,319
because, well, do you want to tell the story?

1489
01:51:51,319 --> 01:51:54,520
No, I can't.

1490
01:51:54,520 --> 01:51:56,520
I guess you have to be there.

1491
01:51:56,520 --> 01:52:00,420
This is getting ripped up and put into the fucking recycling.

1492
01:52:00,420 --> 01:52:02,420
Like, I'm sorry.

1493
01:52:02,420 --> 01:52:04,600
If you have like a formal request and you're gonna send me to like the dean of students,

1494
01:52:04,600 --> 01:52:07,100
this is not how you write it.

1495
01:52:07,100 --> 01:52:10,300
Hey, we want table football.

1496
01:52:10,300 --> 01:52:12,300
I think a lot of the students would like it.

1497
01:52:12,300 --> 01:52:14,300
Actually, a lot of the people on the football team

1498
01:52:14,300 --> 01:52:16,300
said that they thought it was fun to maybe

1499
01:52:16,300 --> 01:52:18,300
just shoot the shit and hang out.

1500
01:52:18,300 --> 01:52:20,300
There's not a lot of stuff in the

1501
01:52:20,300 --> 01:52:22,300
recreation room so far.

1502
01:52:22,300 --> 01:52:30,869
This is not how you write to the dean.

1503
01:52:30,869 --> 01:52:32,869
I request this article of the night with no

1504
01:52:32,869 --> 01:52:34,869
with which to strengthen the moon's power.

1505
01:52:34,869 --> 01:52:38,779
Oh, please, I think it would be lovely.

1506
01:52:38,779 --> 01:52:45,500
This person's expelled.

1507
01:52:45,500 --> 01:52:47,739
Where are they?

1508
01:52:47,739 --> 01:52:49,739
Where are they?

1509
01:52:49,739 --> 01:52:54,979
I'm gonna put the poster right in front of them.

1510
01:52:54,979 --> 01:53:03,750
There you are. Look!

1511
01:53:03,750 --> 01:53:07,850
I gave you the

1512
01:53:07,850 --> 01:53:09,850
haunted Halloween poster.

1513
01:53:09,850 --> 01:53:35,750
Oh, nobody works here.

1514
01:53:35,750 --> 01:53:44,060
Where are you going?

1515
01:53:44,060 --> 01:53:49,050
I was gonna expel you if you threw that on the ground.

1516
01:53:49,050 --> 01:53:51,050
I was gonna hover over the expel button.

1517
01:53:51,050 --> 01:53:55,210
There you go.

1518
01:53:55,210 --> 01:54:04,039
Here comes the needs meter filling up.

1519
01:54:04,039 --> 01:54:08,199
Nice. Look at how happy you are.

1520
01:54:08,199 --> 01:54:12,170
Now go get an A. Dark aura.

1521
01:54:12,170 --> 01:54:20,859
That was a violent

1522
01:54:20,859 --> 01:54:22,859
door close.

1523
01:54:22,859 --> 01:54:27,189
How are we doing? Somebody has to work here.

1524
01:54:27,189 --> 01:54:33,210
I need an assistant. Somebody's gonna open this

1525
01:54:33,210 --> 01:54:39,399
kiosk. Wait. Oh, shit.

1526
01:54:39,399 --> 01:54:41,640
Isn't that person working at the library?

1527
01:54:41,640 --> 01:54:46,060
Where's my staff menu?

1528
01:54:48,359 --> 01:54:53,220
Yeah, I need another staff member.

1529
01:54:53,220 --> 01:54:59,109
I need more assistance. No, no, no.

1530
01:54:59,109 --> 01:55:01,109
I'm going for it. I got it.

1531
01:55:01,109 --> 01:55:05,270
Somebody can do food.

1532
01:55:05,270 --> 01:55:09,800
Can you do food?

1533
01:55:09,800 --> 01:55:13,380
Do they have to have food as a trait? Can anybody do it?

1534
01:55:13,380 --> 01:55:23,050
Or do you have to have food as a trait?

1535
01:55:23,050 --> 01:55:27,529
I think anybody can do it, right?

1536
01:55:27,529 --> 01:55:34,250
You're hired.

1537
01:55:34,250 --> 01:55:37,640
Get in there.

1538
01:55:37,640 --> 01:55:44,810
Where'd they go? Where'd that person go?

1539
01:55:44,810 --> 01:55:51,189
Did they just hire someone?

1540
01:55:51,189 --> 01:56:03,989
Oh, they're just in the staff room.

1541
01:56:03,989 --> 01:56:09,670
Alright, that's fine.

1542
01:56:09,670 --> 01:56:11,670
48, 46, 45.

1543
01:56:11,670 --> 01:56:13,670
What's why these people...

1544
01:56:13,670 --> 01:56:19,539
What's that mean? Why? What's gonna happen?

1545
01:56:19,539 --> 01:56:24,920
What happens if this goes to zero?

1546
01:56:24,920 --> 01:56:42,869
You're expelled. Hurry.

1547
01:56:42,869 --> 01:56:46,010
How do I pause?

1548
01:56:46,010 --> 01:56:48,010
Alright, alright, alright. They want textbook cubicle?

1549
01:56:48,010 --> 01:56:53,189
Oh, there's only one

1550
01:56:53,189 --> 01:57:08,170
in the whole college. Oh, there's not

1551
01:57:08,170 --> 01:57:10,789
one in the entire university.

1552
01:57:10,789 --> 01:57:23,210
Okay, I get it. There! Your demands

1553
01:57:23,210 --> 01:57:27,880
have been met. Is that okay?

1554
01:57:27,880 --> 01:57:30,949
You're gonna get rid of your little

1555
01:57:30,949 --> 01:57:36,579
countdown thing here?

1556
01:57:36,579 --> 01:57:39,140
There, see? Where is this person?

1557
01:57:39,140 --> 01:57:46,180
This person's been sitting in the break room.

1558
01:57:46,180 --> 01:57:51,430
Why are you just sitting here?

1559
01:57:51,430 --> 01:58:01,159
Who works where?

1560
01:58:01,159 --> 01:58:10,420
Weeds. There's only like one weed

1561
01:58:10,420 --> 01:58:13,619
on the whole thing. Alright, that's fine.

1562
01:58:13,619 --> 01:58:16,890
This is looking good. Looks good,

1563
01:58:16,890 --> 01:58:18,890
looks good, looks good, looks good.

1564
01:58:18,890 --> 01:58:21,449
Is there a face swap filter on?

1565
01:58:21,449 --> 01:58:25,340
Oh, it's kinda laggy.

1566
01:58:25,340 --> 01:58:35,260
Hold on.

1567
01:58:35,260 --> 01:58:46,699
That's not better.

1568
01:58:46,699 --> 01:58:49,319
Look at my eyes!

1569
01:58:49,319 --> 01:58:59,159
Why do they look so weird?

1570
01:58:59,159 --> 01:59:01,159
That's better. Not really, but whatever. I don't care.

1571
01:59:01,159 --> 01:59:07,369
Take off the troll chin.

1572
01:59:07,369 --> 01:59:15,500
That's just my face, man. You're very

1573
01:59:15,500 --> 01:59:17,500
blue. I think it's the action movie

1574
01:59:17,500 --> 01:59:19,930
filter. Okay, so you guys have gotten

1575
01:59:19,930 --> 01:59:21,930
used to this filter. Let's turn it off.

1576
01:59:21,930 --> 01:59:24,550
People are gonna be very surprised. You ready?

1577
01:59:24,550 --> 01:59:38,100
Yuck.

1578
01:59:38,100 --> 01:59:59,399
By the way, Two Point Campus is

1579
01:59:59,399 --> 02:00:02,659
on. Nintendo Switch.

1580
02:00:02,659 --> 02:00:06,869
It's on. Xbox.

1581
02:00:06,869 --> 02:00:09,500
It's on.

1582
02:00:09,500 --> 02:00:12,060
PlayStation 5.

1583
02:00:12,060 --> 02:00:14,060
It's also on.

1584
02:00:14,060 --> 02:00:16,060
P P P P P P P P P P P

1585
02:00:16,060 --> 02:00:25,140
P C D P P P C.

1586
02:00:25,140 --> 02:00:28,149
This hurts my head. Wait, can you like see

1587
02:00:28,149 --> 02:00:34,680
like the heat profile of my face?

1588
02:00:34,680 --> 02:00:37,239
Look at my eyes.

1589
02:00:37,239 --> 02:00:45,880
Holy shit, that looks weird.

1590
02:00:45,880 --> 02:00:47,880
You can see like the heat in my eyes.

1591
02:00:47,880 --> 02:01:07,060
That's terrifying.

1592
02:01:07,060 --> 02:01:09,060
I'm back. Nice heat detector.

1593
02:01:09,060 --> 02:01:12,579
That's not thermal. Wait, whatever.

1594
02:01:12,579 --> 02:01:19,369
Alright, let's keep going. And yes, this is by the

1595
02:01:19,369 --> 02:01:23,779
same people that did Two Point Hospital.

1596
02:01:23,779 --> 02:01:25,779
I sss...stop asking it!

1597
02:01:25,779 --> 02:01:27,779
Stop asking it! I see it every five seconds.

1598
02:01:27,779 --> 02:01:36,229
This college is bumping!

1599
02:01:36,229 --> 02:01:38,229
Please change your passwords. Sorry.

1600
02:01:38,229 --> 02:01:44,630
I have showers, right?

1601
02:01:44,630 --> 02:01:53,140
Yep. I actually might need

1602
02:01:53,140 --> 02:02:00,890
I need more classrooms.

1603
02:02:00,890 --> 02:02:02,890
Yeah, I need like another two or three

1604
02:02:02,890 --> 02:02:05,770
I need more classes. I need more professors.

1605
02:02:05,770 --> 02:02:08,520
Should I hire another professor?

1606
02:02:08,520 --> 02:02:13,000
Okay, we need a VR teacher.

1607
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:15,000
No, I don't want to replace this person. That person was doing fine.

1608
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:20,949
Wait, you just threw trash on the ground?

1609
02:02:20,949 --> 02:02:29,590
You're not going to leave, are you?

1610
02:02:29,590 --> 02:02:37,770
It's okay. I don't know what to do with you.

1611
02:02:37,770 --> 02:02:46,649
Where are the students?

1612
02:02:46,649 --> 02:02:49,140
Oh god, there's so many requests.

1613
02:02:49,140 --> 02:02:51,449
Please give us a coffee kiosk.

1614
02:02:51,449 --> 02:02:53,449
Please give us a crescent bench.

1615
02:02:53,449 --> 02:02:55,449
Please give us two-player game tables.

1616
02:02:55,449 --> 02:02:59,350
Give us a love bench. Okay, fine.

1617
02:03:02,039 --> 02:03:04,039
Okay, what else?

1618
02:03:04,039 --> 02:03:06,220
I feel like Bruce Almighty.

1619
02:03:06,220 --> 02:03:08,220
What else do you want?

1620
02:03:08,220 --> 02:03:10,649
Family tree wanted.

1621
02:03:10,649 --> 02:03:12,649
Okay, fine. I'll put this in the dorm.

1622
02:03:12,649 --> 02:03:22,810
Okay, there you go.

1623
02:03:22,810 --> 02:03:24,810
Oh, Statement of the Year.

1624
02:03:24,810 --> 02:03:27,180
12,000 profit.

1625
02:03:27,180 --> 02:03:32,869
That's good.

1626
02:03:32,869 --> 02:03:34,869
It would ruin my reputation if anyone knew I was talking to the Big Cheese.

1627
02:03:34,869 --> 02:03:36,869
But listen, I really want one of these.

1628
02:03:36,869 --> 02:03:42,500
Alright.

1629
02:03:42,500 --> 02:03:47,050
Oh, cool. Yeah, I'll put it here.

1630
02:03:47,050 --> 02:03:49,670
You want a bench?

1631
02:03:49,670 --> 02:03:51,670
Alright, here's your bench.

1632
02:03:51,670 --> 02:03:58,699
Can I put this anywhere?

1633
02:03:58,699 --> 02:04:00,699
Tuition fees are expensive.

1634
02:04:00,699 --> 02:04:02,699
And education is priceless.

1635
02:04:07,300 --> 02:04:09,300
Somebody even walks over here.

1636
02:04:09,300 --> 02:04:11,300
He's going to sit on this random bench in the corner.

1637
02:04:11,300 --> 02:04:14,550
Okay.

1638
02:04:14,550 --> 02:04:16,550
Two-player game table.

1639
02:04:16,550 --> 02:04:19,619
This is a big one.

1640
02:04:19,619 --> 02:04:24,420
These two want to hang out.

1641
02:04:24,420 --> 02:04:48,220
Alright, this is going. Pause it.

1642
02:04:48,220 --> 02:04:50,579
There we go. That's fine. That fits.

1643
02:04:50,579 --> 02:04:58,460
I should move this in the corner.

1644
02:04:58,460 --> 02:05:00,460
Nobody wants to play darts.

1645
02:05:00,460 --> 02:05:11,270
I haven't seen anybody play it once.

1646
02:05:11,270 --> 02:05:14,220
I think the two-player game table will be more popular than darts right now.

1647
02:05:14,220 --> 02:05:18,180
Yeah, it will.

1648
02:05:18,180 --> 02:05:22,149
Darts is cool, but people are requesting this.

1649
02:05:24,970 --> 02:05:31,289
Look, happy.

1650
02:05:31,289 --> 02:05:33,289
Very happy.

1651
02:05:33,289 --> 02:05:35,289
Oh, man. I love a nice coffee.

1652
02:05:35,289 --> 02:05:37,529
I love a nice coffee from a kiosk.

1653
02:05:37,529 --> 02:05:41,180
I'll put this right here.

1654
02:05:41,180 --> 02:05:43,180
You know how amazing this would be?

1655
02:05:43,180 --> 02:05:47,020
Right in front of the door.

1656
02:05:47,020 --> 02:06:03,260
Perfect.

1657
02:06:03,260 --> 02:06:06,579
That's much better.

1658
02:06:06,579 --> 02:06:08,579
Wait, I need another person to work here.

1659
02:06:08,579 --> 02:06:15,989
Someone will take care of it.

1660
02:06:15,989 --> 02:06:17,989
Alright, so far so good. What about my goals?

1661
02:06:17,989 --> 02:06:21,939
Career goals.

1662
02:06:21,939 --> 02:06:23,939
Level up 100 Scientography students.

1663
02:06:23,939 --> 02:06:30,199
Alright, I'll take it.

1664
02:06:30,199 --> 02:06:32,199
Anybody using the benches?

1665
02:06:32,199 --> 02:06:34,199
You look italicized.

1666
02:06:45,539 --> 02:06:47,539
Dude, don't run to the bathroom in class.

1667
02:06:54,779 --> 02:06:56,779
Do not piss into the chemical generator.

1668
02:06:56,779 --> 02:07:01,060
You look askew.

1669
02:07:01,060 --> 02:07:07,720
I don't know why.

1670
02:07:07,720 --> 02:07:10,020
I need another worker.

1671
02:07:10,020 --> 02:07:21,350
I'm in profit right now, so that's fine.

1672
02:07:21,350 --> 02:07:27,239
Where are you going?

1673
02:07:27,239 --> 02:07:31,960
Looking for work?

1674
02:07:31,960 --> 02:07:37,779
Can you not fit here?

1675
02:07:39,779 --> 02:07:41,779
Finally, somebody's here.

1676
02:07:41,779 --> 02:07:47,100
Alright, who wants a hot dog?

1677
02:07:47,100 --> 02:07:54,199
I could go for a hot dog right now.

1678
02:07:54,199 --> 02:07:58,869
I could go for a hot dog right now.

1679
02:07:58,869 --> 02:08:04,619
Three. Just three hot dogs.

1680
02:08:04,619 --> 02:08:08,460
Mustard.

1681
02:08:08,460 --> 02:08:10,760
Ketchup, Tabasco on the third one.

1682
02:08:10,760 --> 02:08:13,579
Mustard, mustard on the first two.

1683
02:08:13,579 --> 02:08:15,579
Ketchup and Tabasco on the third one.

1684
02:08:15,579 --> 02:08:19,479
That's it. Don't put anything else on it.

1685
02:08:19,479 --> 02:08:22,489
That sounds amazing.

1686
02:08:22,489 --> 02:08:26,520
That sounds so good.

1687
02:08:26,520 --> 02:08:29,020
Are you doing the class in a VR helmet?

1688
02:08:29,020 --> 02:08:31,020
That's awesome.

1689
02:08:31,020 --> 02:08:37,739
What's your performance like?

1690
02:08:37,739 --> 02:08:39,739
Are you happy?

1691
02:08:39,739 --> 02:08:45,050
Low energy.

1692
02:08:51,619 --> 02:08:54,500
How's everybody doing?

1693
02:08:54,500 --> 02:08:56,500
Alright, I need campus level nine.

1694
02:08:56,500 --> 02:08:59,510
Average dorm rating. Almost there.

1695
02:08:59,510 --> 02:09:01,510
Quick, add some more

1696
02:09:01,510 --> 02:09:03,510
Nintendo consoles and shit.

1697
02:09:03,510 --> 02:09:06,329
Hold on.

1698
02:09:06,329 --> 02:09:08,329
Rose Garden.

1699
02:09:08,329 --> 02:09:14,649
Hold on. Wait.

1700
02:09:14,649 --> 02:09:34,300
Dorm rating. We need some more stuff in here.

1701
02:09:34,300 --> 02:09:37,300
I need some...

1702
02:09:37,300 --> 02:09:41,020
Electric guitar.

1703
02:09:41,020 --> 02:09:45,420
We need 70%.

1704
02:09:45,420 --> 02:09:50,520
There it is. Rug.

1705
02:09:50,520 --> 02:10:05,479
Another sanitizer.

1706
02:10:05,479 --> 02:10:24,229
Come on! God damn it.

1707
02:10:24,229 --> 02:10:31,260
I didn't get it. Alright, how'd we do?

1708
02:10:31,260 --> 02:10:33,500
Did we do good?

1709
02:10:33,500 --> 02:10:35,500
I think we did okay.

1710
02:10:35,500 --> 02:10:45,979
I think we did alright.

1711
02:10:45,979 --> 02:10:48,220
Oh, that's right. I did that.

1712
02:10:48,220 --> 02:10:50,220
Everyone's got a C+.

1713
02:10:50,220 --> 02:11:03,720
That's passing grade. That's fine.

1714
02:11:03,720 --> 02:11:05,720
Everyone has a 77%.

1715
02:11:05,720 --> 02:11:08,979
97%.

1716
02:11:08,979 --> 02:11:10,979
97% pass rate. I expelled somebody.

1717
02:11:12,979 --> 02:11:14,979
Alright, so now what?

1718
02:11:14,979 --> 02:11:18,310
I can't believe I didn't get that.

1719
02:11:18,310 --> 02:11:23,430
Thanks a lot.

1720
02:11:23,430 --> 02:11:25,430
We sold one hot dog.

1721
02:11:25,430 --> 02:11:31,689
Are there new courses?

1722
02:11:31,689 --> 02:11:34,949
Wait, I can upgrade.

1723
02:11:34,949 --> 02:11:36,949
I want to check out the other campus.

1724
02:11:36,949 --> 02:11:44,619
Okay, here we go.

1725
02:11:44,619 --> 02:11:47,500
That's cool.

1726
02:11:47,500 --> 02:11:49,500
How do I get to see the campus?

1727
02:11:49,500 --> 02:11:56,069
Build more beds for the rating?

1728
02:11:56,069 --> 02:11:58,069
Hold on, I want to check out the other...

1729
02:11:58,069 --> 02:12:07,159
I unlocked another campus. Exit to map?

1730
02:12:07,159 --> 02:12:09,159
Oh, here it is. Save.

1731
02:12:09,159 --> 02:12:18,229
Okay.

1732
02:12:18,229 --> 02:12:20,229
Piazza Lanatra is now available.

1733
02:12:20,229 --> 02:12:26,100
Let's check it out.

1734
02:12:26,100 --> 02:12:28,100
Countryside college is low expectations and a nice

1735
02:12:28,100 --> 02:12:30,100
canal. It's the perfect place to start your career.

1736
02:12:30,100 --> 02:12:34,699
Let's check it out.

1737
02:12:34,699 --> 02:12:36,699
Bring back the... Oh, forgot I deleted the panic room guy.

1738
02:12:36,699 --> 02:12:39,130
I should definitely bring him back.

1739
02:12:39,130 --> 02:12:43,930
I'm not sure exactly where I can get

1740
02:12:43,930 --> 02:12:45,930
this awesome looking game.

1741
02:12:45,930 --> 02:12:49,430
Well, I'm really glad you asked.

1742
02:12:49,430 --> 02:12:51,430
Two Point Campus is available on Steam.

1743
02:12:51,430 --> 02:12:53,430
It's on the Xbox, PlayStation.

1744
02:12:53,430 --> 02:12:55,430
It's on Switch. It's pretty much every

1745
02:12:55,430 --> 02:12:57,989
major platform you could possibly imagine.

1746
02:12:57,989 --> 02:13:01,380
Also,

1747
02:13:01,380 --> 02:13:03,380
there's a link in the chat that's

1748
02:13:03,380 --> 02:13:07,739
being shown.

1749
02:13:07,739 --> 02:13:09,739
Obviously, there's a panel down there you can click the link to if you want.

1750
02:13:09,739 --> 02:13:11,739
Just go to Steam.

1751
02:13:11,739 --> 02:13:14,359
It's on Steam.

1752
02:13:14,359 --> 02:13:16,359
I mean,

1753
02:13:16,359 --> 02:13:18,359
you can

1754
02:13:18,359 --> 02:13:20,359
get it. I think it's good.

1755
02:13:20,359 --> 02:13:23,619
You can get it on Switch.

1756
02:13:23,619 --> 02:13:25,619
My only talking points that I've said all...

1757
02:13:25,619 --> 02:13:27,619
It's just like you can get it on Switch.

1758
02:13:27,619 --> 02:13:29,619
You can get it on Xbox.

1759
02:13:29,619 --> 02:13:31,619
You can get it on the Switch. Hey, by the way,

1760
02:13:31,619 --> 02:13:33,619
you can get it on the Switch.

1761
02:13:33,619 --> 02:13:37,529
I want to see the

1762
02:13:37,529 --> 02:13:41,300
relationship system.

1763
02:13:41,300 --> 02:13:48,279
It's important. Where's the people that

1764
02:13:48,279 --> 02:13:52,060
requested this?

1765
02:13:52,060 --> 02:13:55,380
Oh, panic room guy, right.

1766
02:13:55,380 --> 02:13:57,939
Two Point Hospital was fun, too.

1767
02:13:57,939 --> 02:13:59,939
If you liked Two Point Hospital,

1768
02:13:59,939 --> 02:14:01,939
and you were like, damn, I kind of wish Two Point Hospital

1769
02:14:01,939 --> 02:14:03,939
was like a college simulator game,

1770
02:14:03,939 --> 02:14:07,079
this is the game for you. It's clean.

1771
02:14:07,079 --> 02:14:09,640
It's fun. It's cute.

1772
02:14:09,640 --> 02:14:11,640
Seems like there's a lot to do.

1773
02:14:11,640 --> 02:14:17,979
And why am I here? Did I pick the same

1774
02:14:17,979 --> 02:14:30,520
place? Oh, I was like,

1775
02:14:30,520 --> 02:14:40,500
what? Didn't I pick it? It should be a

1776
02:14:40,500 --> 02:14:45,369
weed dealer. This is more of a

1777
02:14:45,369 --> 02:14:49,140
city.

1778
02:15:03,770 --> 02:15:05,770
Wait, there are clubs in this game?

1779
02:15:07,770 --> 02:15:09,770
There's like clubs.

1780
02:15:09,770 --> 02:15:11,770
There's no way that that's a real picture.

1781
02:15:11,770 --> 02:15:13,770
I don't know what you're talking about.

1782
02:15:13,770 --> 02:15:16,390
What picture? You mean the up here?

1783
02:15:16,390 --> 02:15:22,600
Wait, what do you mean?

1784
02:15:22,600 --> 02:15:27,340
I mean, you're very obviously like

1785
02:15:27,340 --> 02:15:38,470
fucked with this. I mean, if you do it

1786
02:15:38,470 --> 02:16:03,609
subtly enough, I get it.

1787
02:16:03,609 --> 02:16:05,609
You can make me believe something, but

1788
02:16:05,609 --> 02:16:14,060
you're not going to make me believe this is a real picture.

1789
02:16:14,060 --> 02:16:16,060
I mean, you're very obviously like

1790
02:16:16,060 --> 02:16:18,300
fucked with this. I mean, if you do it

1791
02:16:18,300 --> 02:16:20,300
subtly enough, I get it. You can make me believe something, but

1792
02:16:20,300 --> 02:16:22,300
you're not going to make me believe this is a real picture

1793
02:16:22,300 --> 02:16:24,859
in the state this currently is in right now.

1794
02:16:24,859 --> 02:16:27,739

Real picture, this is what you look like.

1797
02:16:34,069 --> 02:16:36,069
That's not serious. You have to make it at least believable.

1798
02:16:36,069 --> 02:16:50,219
That's not very believable at all.

1799
02:16:50,219 --> 02:16:52,219
You bulged my

1800
02:16:52,219 --> 02:16:54,219

it's election day here in two-point county yo I got a crooked face sideways

1884
02:32:11,979 --> 02:32:16,100
it's amazing to think that that was jarring when I did when it went the

1885
02:32:16,100 --> 02:32:20,840
other way if no one voted that year that's the mysterious one today

1886
02:32:20,840 --> 02:32:25,440
technology looks pretty good anyway here's hoping that this year we'll get

1887
02:32:25,440 --> 02:32:39,709
some votes in that's not what it looks like though I mean this is funny but

1888
02:32:39,709 --> 02:33:06,899
this is not what it looks like look like a hearthstone card that doesn't look

1889
02:33:06,899 --> 02:33:17,889
like me okay um that was actually jarring when I swapped it the other way

1890
02:33:17,889 --> 02:33:41,819
okay let me finish this please okay this looks like image one of my tinder

1891
02:33:41,819 --> 02:33:47,819

1901
02:34:59,780 --> 02:35:08,120
messed up I think you're catching the lens distortion from being on the wide

1902
02:35:08,120 --> 02:35:13,930
you know what you're probably right so the camera word from Jeffrey and the

1903
02:35:13,930 --> 02:35:18,489
camera is not right in front of me it's all the way over here because I don't

want to get this in the frame so I'm sitting on the very edge of the webcam

1905
02:35:24,329 --> 02:35:28,809
maybe so I'm catching the very end if I were to drag this over you'd see it why

1906
02:35:29,770 --> 02:35:31,770
it's the camera's like over there

02:42:13,149 --> 02:42:18,149
we do know is that hold on he has triumphed meaning that yet again the

1942
02:42:18,149 --> 02:42:21,629
people of two point come on I want to hear what he says what they asked for

1943
02:42:21,629 --> 02:42:29,819
we've made our bed and now it's time to sleep in it all he knows he can hear us

1944
02:42:29,819 --> 02:42:36,729
all right stop eating toilet water okay so of eggs are not usually the only

1945
02:42:36,809 --> 02:42:42,229
thing you eat if you have a meal whether it's breakfast whether it's you know

1946
02:42:42,229 --> 02:42:47,829
brunch or lunch whatever you put your eggs on eggs is not the only thing that

1947
02:42:47,829 --> 02:42:54,700
you have on the plate so there's usually eggs bacon sausage tomato toast you know

1948
02:42:54,700 --> 02:43:01,059
what doesn't matter whatever's there if you have a runny egg you when you touch

1949
02:43:01,059 --> 02:43:08,059
the yolk it just explodes and gets on every single other piece of food it just

1950
02:43:08,180 --> 02:43:12,059
kind of gets everywhere and then it starts congealing and gets hard and

1951
02:43:12,059 --> 02:43:17,270
weird over medium is perfect and over easy to over medium somewhere in the

1952
02:43:17,270 --> 02:43:22,469
middle because the egg is still kind of runny and jammy and soft but it doesn't

1953
02:43:22,469 --> 02:43:26,579
just explode everywhere and then turn to this mess on your plate that's the point

1954
02:43:26,579 --> 02:43:31,500
but I don't want just egg yolk all over everything else that I'm eating I want

1955
02:43:31,500 --> 02:43:36,659
to choose to dip my sausage in the egg yolk I don't want to be forced to have my

1956
02:43:36,700 --> 02:43:42,170
sausage in the egg yolk right I want to be able to choose to do that sometimes

1957
02:43:42,170 --> 02:43:44,930
you just want to bite a sausage that has no egg yolk on it but sorry if you have

1958

2068
03:07:06,940 --> 03:07:15,139
space like oh yeah right here okay with buildings empty up just I don't want to

2069

2070
03:07:26,239 --> 03:07:34,200
gonna put in here a dessert thing up the quality on your webcam yeah I don't

2071
03:07:34,200 --> 03:07:41,360
webcams I don't care about see the problem is this thing has this stupid

2072
03:07:42,200 --> 03:07:49,459
auto exposure that even if I turn it I can't is such dog shit they really are

2073
03:07:49,459 --> 03:08:02,000
it's so bad so I can't really mess with the settings on this what do I do this

2074
03:08:02,000 --> 03:08:14,920
well let me try something yeah so I get it does this auto exposure that if I

2075
03:08:14,920 --> 03:08:23,530
turn off auto exposure it goes just dark so this is it without auto exposure on

2076
03:08:23,530 --> 03:08:31,059
I keep in mind I have a I have a ring light glaring into my face right now it

2077
03:08:31,059 --> 03:08:38,280
doesn't make any sense it's doesn't make any sense here's I have a light right

2078
03:08:38,280 --> 03:08:46,590
here I'm gonna turn as bright as that's as bright as this goes and it is it is

2079
03:08:46,590 --> 03:08:54,680
filling this room and burning into my face and if I turn the exposure up just

2080
03:08:54,680 --> 03:09:03,010
a little bit now look at this we're at like 10 FPS right put it down again with

2081
03:09:03,569 --> 03:09:10,239
the ISO changes yeah it's annoying and then when I hit auto exposure here it

2082
03:09:10,239 --> 03:09:23,010
blows me out I don't get it it's annoying that's for sure in the room

2083
03:09:23,010 --> 03:09:30,100
light on it is on you have no idea how I actually bright that really is it hurts

2084
03:09:30,100 --> 03:09:43,360
what is gonna have to be 20 FPS Andy oh also keep in mind I know I'm looking at

2085
03:09:43,360 --> 03:09:53,670
you here was that also keep in mind change the gain yeah if I turn the gain

2086
03:09:53,670 --> 03:09:58,500
down or turn it up it does the same thing it's weird wait let me try that

2087
03:09:58,500 --> 03:10:04,940
and see if I look like an idiot Sunday is green screen movie night part 2

2088
03:10:04,940 --> 03:10:08,459
because it's some fancy but nothing tomorrow but we'll be back on Sunday or

2089
03:10:08,459 --> 03:10:12,139
green screen radio is pure jazz man and that's gonna be a fun one I'm

2090
03:10:12,139 --> 03:10:17,559
predictable and just learn sure you could pay some let me try this tell you

2091
03:10:17,559 --> 03:10:25,700
which buttons to press and so let's turn this on that radio that's that we

2092
03:10:25,700 --> 03:10:49,659
scheduled so then if I turn the gain up here we'll try it that better my semi in

2093
03:10:49,659 --> 03:11:01,790
60 FPS said is that way better contrast is a little too high though isn't it

2094
03:11:01,790 --> 03:11:20,000
how's that I think that's actually better I think we're good now you can see all

2095
03:11:20,000 --> 03:11:27,799
the gross individual hairs on my beard because it's darkening them whatever

2096
03:11:27,799 --> 03:11:32,959
that's what the exposure down to the gain up

2097
03:11:33,239 --> 03:11:36,959
your chicken should not be pink hey we really loved the sponsored content when

2098
03:11:36,959 --> 03:11:46,799
you were fixing your camera and we're having a fucking blast in two-point

bad people I forgot where I put them but whatever I used to like making the

2110
03:13:38,670 --> 03:13:43,790
little volcano it's pretty trippy to learn that volcanoes what's wrong this

2111

2114
03:14:23,750 --> 03:14:30,350
mine and I looked to see what was on sale what was available and lo and behold

2115

2140
03:20:56,379 --> 03:21:00,020
your students know the spell lines access to Northgate I don't think so bad

2141
03:21:00,020 --> 03:21:14,079
teacher Andy I want let me go to the map I'm curious about something I want to see

2142
03:21:14,079 --> 03:21:25,889
how many zones there are this one's like medieval themed this is the original one

2143
03:21:25,889 --> 03:21:34,829
this is like the one we're on now this one looks like it unlocks maybe this is

2144
03:21:34,829 --> 03:21:44,790
baseball kind of stadium this one over here is there a sandbox mode I'm curious

2145
03:21:44,829 --> 03:21:55,629
did you take a shower there is a sandbox mode oh you have to like beat the game

2146
03:21:55,629 --> 03:22:06,440
okay okay that's cool well you have to get at least through the game this is a

2147
03:22:06,440 --> 03:22:14,420
German stand-in I could see how you feel that way all right let's go back what

2148
03:22:14,420 --> 03:22:23,940
else yeah we'll be like another five minutes you need to do the first four

2149
03:22:23,940 --> 03:22:32,879
levels you're a genuine question how do you manage your pain levels when your

2150
03:22:32,879 --> 03:22:44,370
chronic pain flares up um if I'm really honest distractions help and this is

2151
03:22:44,370 --> 03:22:50,299
kind of one of them whenever I'm just kind of sitting there hanging out and I

2152
03:22:50,299 --> 03:22:54,620
like don't care about that kind of the shitty way that I feel a lot of time

2153
03:22:54,620 --> 03:23:02,270
it's I kind of just put it back here and it's not accessed you probably see from

2154
03:23:02,270 --> 03:23:08,860
time to time I'm you probably pick up on it when I go like this that's me going

2155
03:23:08,860 --> 03:23:16,350
like anytime that you can see the letters down here when I go like that

2156
03:23:16,549 --> 03:23:24,549
it is there it always is and but I just do it and I just try to put it back here

2157
03:23:24,549 --> 03:23:28,290
and just not put it in the front of my head and it's crazy that if you do that

2158
03:23:28,290 --> 03:23:32,899
if you actually try to just distract yourself with stuff you don't focus on

2159
03:23:32,899 --> 03:23:39,020
it and I know that sounds really like yeah man that like it sucks it does but

2160
03:23:39,020 --> 03:23:44,620
I'm right now having fun I'm having fun playing this game hanging out being a

2161
03:23:44,620 --> 03:23:49,780
dickhead on stream so like I don't I don't have time to care about that I

2162
03:23:49,780 --> 03:23:55,629
don't have the capacity to give a shit about that right now right and also go

2163
03:23:55,629 --> 03:24:00,540
to your doctor to pain management's a huge pain in the ass it really is there's

2164
03:24:00,540 --> 03:24:05,260
so many weird dumb things that our body does for no reason that you really

2165
03:24:05,260 --> 03:24:14,329
should have a program with it out with your doctor yeah it's a lot of

2166
03:24:14,329 --> 03:24:22,360
distractions and the more that I have like fun that the more that it does it's

2167
03:24:22,399 --> 03:24:28,930
not a thing that I care about and it sucks it when the stream turns off and

2168
03:24:28,930 --> 03:24:37,409
I'm just kind of lying in bed it's like oh what that's a no excuse me yeah oh

2169
03:24:37,409 --> 03:24:52,760
yeah but that's just that that's just the fact thanks for the cool streams hey

2170
03:24:52,760 --> 03:25:00,729
thanks for being here I'm glad you're here let's have some fun and with that

2171
03:25:00,729 --> 03:25:06,860
I'll see you guys later if streaming helps manage pain why

2172
03:25:06,899 --> 03:25:11,819
well let me make this really clear it's not like the act of streaming that's

2173
03:25:11,819 --> 03:25:18,500
managing my pain symptoms it's just one of a few one of many things that can

2174
03:25:18,500 --> 03:25:22,059
distract me from the current problem make no mistake about it the reason why

2175
03:25:22,059 --> 03:25:25,020
I only stream two three days a week is because it actually does become a

2176
03:25:25,020 --> 03:25:30,159
problem after I sit here for a long time then I'm not hey guys I'm managing my

2177
03:25:30,159 --> 03:25:40,159
pain with twitch streams that's not that's not what I mean yeah that's two

2178
03:25:40,159 --> 03:25:44,520
point campus I give it a stamp of recommendation I know the stream is

2179
03:25:44,520 --> 03:25:51,659
sponsored but I mean it's it it's a fun tongue-in-cheek light-hearted management

2180
03:25:51,659 --> 03:25:57,379
to point kind of tycoon type games it's fun it just is these games are fun there's

2181
03:25:57,379 --> 03:26:05,479
no other way I can spin that for you it's available on you know devs obviously

2182
03:26:05,479 --> 03:26:12,510
I appreciate the sponsor so thank you to two-point campus devs it's a great

2183
03:26:12,510 --> 03:26:18,319
game I think it's really fun I actually think it's a fun game hope you guys

2184
03:26:18,319 --> 03:26:24,399
enjoyed it if you want it if you wanted to you know do your own get on steam

2185
03:26:24,399 --> 03:26:33,959
right now seems like there's a lot of content seems promising is it on switch

2186
03:26:33,959 --> 03:26:41,530
oh yes it is and then a call to the lamb you will see that I will bring call to

2187
03:26:41,530 --> 03:26:54,840
the lamb back after baseball I got a lot of things lined up after baseball yeah

2188
03:26:54,840 --> 03:26:59,969
then that game was really good too two two solid video games back to back today

2189
03:26:59,969 --> 03:27:04,270
yeah that's gonna end the stream that'll end this off with obviously the sponsor

2190
03:27:04,270 --> 03:27:09,350
segment as well go support these devs because you know if they supported the

2191
03:27:09,350 --> 03:27:15,870
channel so that's good special thanks to two-point campus I'll see you guys on

2192

2194
03:27:49,719 --> 03:28:05,540

2195
03:28:05,540 --> 03:28:11,100
be watching I know for a fact that there's at least three to four hours I

2196
03:28:11,100 --> 03:28:18,139
think of content that we have not seen yet so should be exciting stuff I agree

2197
03:28:18,299 --> 03:28:24,000
yeah you should it's I mean in about six hours here you've been potentially

2198
03:28:24,000 --> 03:28:35,959
watching for a long time I would hydrate if you haven't yeah see you on Sunday

2199
