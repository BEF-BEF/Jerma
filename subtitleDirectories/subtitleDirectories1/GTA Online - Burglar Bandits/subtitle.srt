1
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:08,339
I can't even put into words how upset I am right now.

2
00:00:08,339 --> 00:00:11,699
I've missed the wine convention by two hours,

3
00:00:11,699 --> 00:00:16,339
and I bought this special red wine suit to prove how much I love wine,

4
00:00:16,339 --> 00:00:18,820
and now what am I supposed to do, throw it in the trash?

5
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:20,339
Oh hey Jerm, how the fuck out of here?

6
00:00:22,309 --> 00:00:26,070
By the way, can I just say, we both look like fucking idiots.

7
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:30,309
You look like a Dead Rising character.

8
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:32,549
Look at how I'm leaning in.

9
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:33,590
Can I not hear him?

10
00:00:34,549 --> 00:00:35,350
What's he saying?

11
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:38,710
Okay, yeah, I got it. I gotta be real close.

12
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:40,390
You know, I don't hear so well no more.

13
00:00:41,509 --> 00:00:43,270
I look like I just work in a movie theater.

14
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:46,630
You look like an usher.

15
00:00:47,509 --> 00:00:50,070
What's with the Gatorade tattoo you have on your arm?

16
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:53,509
That's supposed to be a slight lightning bolt.

17
00:00:53,509 --> 00:00:55,350
That's a fucking Gatorade logo.

18
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:57,130
No.

19
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,600
You're doing the hacking job.

20
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,960
Okay, so now I'm the hacker. Got it.

21
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:05,620
I'll do the hacking.

22
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,680
So on the way there, I gotta hack the system.

23
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:14,060
Not easy.

24
00:01:17,239 --> 00:01:18,840
Fucking no, shit.

25
00:01:20,409 --> 00:01:21,530
What did we lose the height?

26
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:25,829
Don't make me laugh.

27
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:36,540
Don't sneeze like a fucking dickhead.

28
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:37,420
Give me a second.

29
00:01:39,579 --> 00:01:40,620
I can't fail it again.

30
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:43,000
I failed it again.

31
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,560
I actually have to blow my nose right now.

32
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,060
Let's go.

33
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:48,709
The fucking stick up.

34
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:53,129
Another block.

35
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:55,019
Good idea.

36
00:01:55,019 --> 00:01:55,739
Real good idea.

37
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,219
That's not so much of a good idea,

38
00:01:58,219 --> 00:01:59,739
except I think it might have just worked.

39
00:02:01,019 --> 00:02:03,340
Holy shit, how the hell did you pull that off?

40
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:04,780
It was like Dukes of Azeroth.

41
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:07,659
You just did like a Tony Hawk ollie off of a wall.

42
00:02:08,939 --> 00:02:11,219
Okay, I gotta admit, that was pretty impressive,

43
00:02:11,219 --> 00:02:12,340
but can you do it again?

44
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:16,949
Just like squeezed right there.

45
00:02:16,949 --> 00:02:18,469
That was nice, man.

46
00:02:19,189 --> 00:02:20,550
I think we're gonna blow up this bridge.

47
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:21,770
What?

48
00:02:22,229 --> 00:02:24,250
All right, we're looking at the bridge here.

49
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:27,110
Is there a helicopter there?

50
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:28,310
Do we have to destroy the helicopter?

51
00:02:28,949 --> 00:02:29,909
No, that's for us.

52
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:31,509
What do you mean that's for us?

53
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,139
It's magnetizing us to it.

54
00:02:35,139 --> 00:02:36,979
We're gonna get sucked up by a super magnet?

55
00:02:41,349 --> 00:02:42,550
Oh, did you just get out?

56
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:44,939
Did you get out of the car?

57
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:46,699
Oh my gosh.

58
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:57,340
We'll take him down.

59
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:59,020
I want an APB put out of this guy.

60
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:00,539
We're not gonna stop until he's here.

61
00:03:00,539 --> 00:03:01,500
Where'd he go?

62
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,060
Where is he?

63
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:04,780
I don't remember anything.

64
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:06,060
Can anyone remember anything?

65
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:06,699
I don't remember.

66
00:03:06,699 --> 00:03:09,099
There's nine bullets discharged from my gun.

67
00:03:09,099 --> 00:03:10,219
Why did I do that?

68
00:03:10,219 --> 00:03:12,219
All I remember is I'm the bad cop.

69
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:15,340
I think I'm a bad cop.

70
00:03:16,139 --> 00:03:16,939
I'm gonna go home.

71
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:20,870
I'm in the prison bus.

72
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:21,750
I'm just gonna drive.

73
00:03:22,389 --> 00:03:23,110
We're all behind you.

74
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:26,580
What is this car doing?

75
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,020
This isn't even a cop that just ran me.

76
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:32,900
Man, there's like speed demons on the road for some fucked up reason.

77
00:03:35,219 --> 00:03:37,300
Did somebody fly out of the sky?

78
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,419
Oh, I don't want to go in here.

79
00:03:38,419 --> 00:03:41,370
I actually screwed up.

80
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:43,139
What was that?

81
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:45,219
Why did the guy just fall from the sky?

82
00:03:46,099 --> 00:03:47,300
You need to kill this helicopter.

83
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:50,120
Perfect.

84
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:54,060
Very, very nice.

85
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:55,180
I hope we don't blow this up.

86
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:56,620
Oh, there's a helicopter right in front of us.

87
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:58,860
Oh, and this thing's upside down.

88
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:00,860
We're just sliding down.

89
00:04:01,819 --> 00:04:02,460
Come on.

90
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:03,979
Actually, oh, wow.

91
00:04:05,189 --> 00:04:06,069
Holy shit.

92
00:04:06,789 --> 00:04:10,310
Did that seriously just end up working in our favor?

93
00:04:12,469 --> 00:04:14,789
That can't be serious right now, right?

94
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:17,160
We're not found.

95
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:19,639
Quiet, quiet, quiet, shut up.

96
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:20,199
Oh, they've had us.

97
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:20,699
Fuck.

98
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:25,019
I mean, in full uniform, but.

99
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:27,560
Shit.

100
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,680
Take a right at the street.

101
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:32,889
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

102
00:04:32,889 --> 00:04:33,689
Oh, fuck.

103
00:04:33,689 --> 00:04:34,569
That's not the street.

104
00:04:34,569 --> 00:04:35,370
Just take a right.

105
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:36,089
You're still fine.

106
00:04:36,089 --> 00:04:37,370
He's in between.

107
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:38,250
Oh, come on.

108
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:40,889
Hold X to duck.

109
00:04:42,709 --> 00:04:43,430
Hold X.

110
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:43,990
Hold X.

111
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:44,629
You're not holding it.

112
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:49,110
We're in some guy's garage.

113
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:49,670
Oh, my gosh.

114
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:50,149
They're coming.

115
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:52,149
They're not going to see us.

116
00:04:52,149 --> 00:04:52,949
They're not going to see us.

117
00:04:52,949 --> 00:04:53,990
They're coming down the street.

118
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:55,029
We'll hide in a garage.

119
00:04:55,029 --> 00:04:55,750
They can't even see.

120
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:56,629
Oh, my gosh.

121
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:57,129
Oh.

122
00:04:58,779 --> 00:04:59,660
You're not even in my car.

123
00:05:00,939 --> 00:05:02,220
Oh, you're in the back.

124
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:02,540
Hold on.

125
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:03,339
Let me get in there.

126
00:05:07,819 --> 00:05:09,019
I'm so glad that worked.

127
00:05:09,019 --> 00:05:10,620
He just pulled into his garage.

128
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,540
Yeah, we like ran into that guy.

129
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:13,899
That guy could have just called the police.

130
00:05:13,899 --> 00:05:15,019
He's on the ground dead.

131
00:05:15,019 --> 00:05:16,060
Oh, no, he's not.

132
00:05:16,699 --> 00:05:17,660
That guy ran in his house.

133
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:18,939
He probably could have just called the police

134
00:05:18,939 --> 00:05:20,779
and been like, oh, you're looking for a guy in a cop car?

135
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:24,540
He just like hit me and is hiding in my garage.

136
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:28,519
There's a car that's going to pull up here in a second.

137
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:30,040
This one right here.

138
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,000
Two guys are going to get out.

139
00:05:32,339 --> 00:05:34,339
And you have to pick who you want to shoot

140
00:05:34,339 --> 00:05:36,100
because we have to shoot them both at the same time.

141
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:36,899
How long do we have?

142
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:38,180
Like now.

143
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:38,500
Ready?

144
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,379
I'm going to get the guy on the right.

145
00:05:39,379 --> 00:05:39,939
Are you ready?

146
00:05:39,939 --> 00:05:40,500
Sure.

147
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,860
Three, two, one, shoot.

148
00:05:42,899 --> 00:05:44,660
Now go get the we got to get the briefcase.

149
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:56,250
I thought since you did this before,

150
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:57,769
this was the surefire way to do it.

151
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:00,149
Just hold on a second.

152
00:06:00,149 --> 00:06:01,269
I have to go get some snacks.

153
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:05,560
Sir, do you have any butterfingers or Eggo waffles here?

154
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,199
I'm craving them.

155
00:06:07,779 --> 00:06:08,819
Put all the money in the register.

156
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:10,699
Hurry up.

157
00:06:10,699 --> 00:06:11,420
Make it snappy.

158
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:12,459
Oh, I thought this was a handgun.

159
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,839
Did that really just happen?

160
00:06:16,839 --> 00:06:17,720
I'm sorry.

161
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,920
I just wanted some snacks.

162
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,319
I see the guy in the plane.

163
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:22,360
Yeah.

164
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,079
What is his job?

165
00:06:23,079 --> 00:06:24,360
Is he just like kind of circling around?

166
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,480
I'm not sure what he's supposed to do,

167
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,600
but he's supposed to pick us up.

168
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,319
He's our getaway.

169
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:29,480
All right.

170
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,439
We're about to park.

171
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:32,819
I'm not supposed to get out of the car.

172
00:06:32,819 --> 00:06:33,860
You're supposed to pull me out.

173
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,060
No, you're my prisoner.

174
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:35,699
I take you out.

175
00:06:35,699 --> 00:06:36,579
So you're in handcuffs.

176
00:06:38,579 --> 00:06:40,259
Get out of here, you fucking scumbag.

177
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:42,329
Don't worry.

178
00:06:42,329 --> 00:06:42,889
I got this.

179
00:06:42,889 --> 00:06:43,850
I got this, asshole.

180
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:45,850
So you have to walk.

181
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:47,829
Don't do anything insane.

182
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:58,980
Oh, you idiot.

183
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:01,800
Why did you do that?

184
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:03,699
We can still do it.

185
00:07:03,699 --> 00:07:04,420
We can still do it.

186
00:07:05,139 --> 00:07:07,660
I mean, this can be the hardest thing in the world,

187
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:08,459
but we can still do it.

188
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:10,970
Hold on.

189
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:11,610
We need to go.

190
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:14,980
A little premature.

191
00:07:16,899 --> 00:07:17,379
Holy shit.

192
00:07:17,379 --> 00:07:18,740
Did that guy just jump?

193
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:20,180
Fucking kill them both.

194
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:22,040
Oh, my gosh.

195
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,449
You just totally screwed us.

196
00:07:25,449 --> 00:07:25,850
I know.

197
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:30,009
I can't believe we're actually still alive.

198
00:07:30,649 --> 00:07:31,930
I don't even know what we're doing now.

199
00:07:32,649 --> 00:07:33,689
You need to start shooting people.

200
00:07:33,689 --> 00:07:35,370
I haven't seen you shoot your gun one time.

201
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:36,649
We have to get the prisoner out.

202
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:44,470
There's no markers there.

203
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:46,149
I'll mark it for you.

204
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:50,459
No, it looks like he's flying to us.

205
00:07:50,459 --> 00:07:51,019
Airplane.

206
00:07:51,819 --> 00:07:54,899
That's a cop helicopter, I think.

207
00:07:55,699 --> 00:07:56,339
Is it?

208
00:07:56,339 --> 00:07:58,259
We need to get another teammate.

209
00:07:58,259 --> 00:08:00,339
I got just destroyed from behind.

210
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:02,600
Hopefully.

211
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,480
Oh, Jesus, man.

212
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:08,259
It just spawned me in such a stupid spot.

213
00:08:08,259 --> 00:08:09,379
Holy shit.

214
00:08:09,379 --> 00:08:10,100
Oh, my God.

215
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:11,860
Oh, dear God, dude.

216
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:14,860
Oh, my fucking God.

217
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:15,500
This is horrible.

218
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:17,180
We might look at we're going to lose.

219
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:20,220
I'm shooting just rockets in like every direction.

220
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:26,009
Okay, why?

221
00:08:26,889 --> 00:08:31,370
Why would it spawn me in the middle of the fucking street?

222
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:36,409
With like nine cruisers and four helicopters.
