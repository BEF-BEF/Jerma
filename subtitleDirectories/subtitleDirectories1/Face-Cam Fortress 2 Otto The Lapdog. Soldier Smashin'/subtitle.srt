1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:10,560
Hey, what is going on, everybody?

2
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:14,560
Jerma here, wait a second, Otto, you have to make your camera debut.

3
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:20,059
Jerma and Otto, and there's actually somebody else in this call, go ahead and introduce yourself.

4
00:00:20,059 --> 00:00:21,370
Hi.

5
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:22,539
Who's that?

6
00:00:22,539 --> 00:00:25,410
It's Boo.

7
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:32,579
But yes, Otto wanted to say hello, because you haven't had a checkup with Otto in a while, he's doing okay.

8
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:37,890
See, he's got a good face, he's got a good white stripe, he's a good dog.

9
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:39,890
He was actually lying down right here for a while.

10
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:42,890
But yeah, Space Game Fortress 2, this is Monday's edition.

11
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:44,890
Hope you're having a fantastic Monday.

12
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:48,890
I'm just like standing still, like oh, let me like talk for like five minutes, just not play.

13
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:51,450
I have no idea who I killed, but they're dead.

14
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:56,450
So Otto wanted to get down, he's down there now, and oh my god, what just even killed me, I don't even know.

15
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:59,250
I don't even know.

16
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:02,060
But we're on offense now.

17
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:05,650
We are on the offense.

18
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:08,079
And I changed what I was using.

19
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:12,959
I want to get my scarcely lethal...

20
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:13,959
I think that's what it is.

21
00:01:13,959 --> 00:01:15,959
Scarcely lethal...

22
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:17,959
Why can't I not even think of the name of this weapon?

23
00:01:17,959 --> 00:01:18,959
The Liberty Launcher.

24
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:20,959
Scarcely lethal gun.

25
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:22,390
No!

26
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:23,700
Hide.

27
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:26,129
Watch the dead ring spy behind us.

28
00:01:26,129 --> 00:01:27,129
Oh god, really?

29
00:01:27,129 --> 00:01:29,129
No, he's a scout.

30
00:01:29,129 --> 00:01:30,129
No, I got him.

31
00:01:30,129 --> 00:01:32,430
Oh, is he truly dead though?

32
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:35,430
Yeah, I got a new rank on my pistol for it.

33
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:38,430
That's one way to tell.

34
00:01:40,819 --> 00:01:42,819
Oh, how did I not kill him?

35
00:01:42,819 --> 00:01:46,599
Very, very good.

36
00:01:46,599 --> 00:01:50,599
Is that actually like a spy check, or does it fake that to be your new rank on your weapon?

37
00:01:50,599 --> 00:01:52,599
I don't think it would fake that.

38
00:01:52,599 --> 00:01:54,599
That's something I would...

39
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:55,599
That would be very weird if it did.

40
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:57,969
The spy is up top right here.

41
00:01:57,969 --> 00:01:58,969
Oh, I see him.

42
00:01:58,969 --> 00:01:59,969
I think he's dead, I don't know.

43
00:01:59,969 --> 00:02:00,969
No, he's not.

44
00:02:00,969 --> 00:02:03,969
He's actually like stuffed in this corner over here with me.

45
00:02:03,969 --> 00:02:06,969
And he got the health too, that prickly bastard.

46
00:02:06,969 --> 00:02:09,870
Hey, there's a spy here.

47
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:10,870
Watch it.

48
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:11,870
Oh, I just picked up the ammo.

49
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:12,870
I'm sorry, dude.

50
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:13,870
That guy's an energy.

51
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:15,370
I got him.

52
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:16,370
You got him?

53
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:17,370
Yep.

54
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:18,370
Okay, good.

55
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:19,370
I'm gonna go put a tele-exit upstairs.

56
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:22,370
Oh, we are absolutely rolling right now.

57
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:26,699
All right, black box soldier coming from the upstairs.

58
00:02:26,699 --> 00:02:28,870
Ooh, really?

59
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:36,060
You know what?

60
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:37,060
You die.

61
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:41,060
We have a friendly spy crabbing out of spawn, making his way through the field.

62
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:43,060
Oh wait, we have a wild spy crab?

63
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:46,330
Really?

64
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:48,330
I didn't know we had a wild spy crab.

65
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:52,090
That makes me happy.

66
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:54,090
All right, let's push this car.

67
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:55,090
Nobody here.

68
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:58,090
Oh, this is a heavy...

69
00:02:58,090 --> 00:02:59,090
I want to go back and just shoot that guy.

70
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:01,090
He probably has no health.

71
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:02,710
But there's nobody here.

72
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:03,710
Where is everybody?

73
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:04,949
Oh my word.

74
00:03:04,949 --> 00:03:05,949
Where's the sentry?

75
00:03:05,949 --> 00:03:07,960
Where's that sentry gun?

76
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,960
Is it up top behind everybody?

77
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,710
I don't see it.

78
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:15,870
It must be up on the corridor.

79
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:17,370
Hmm.

80
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:20,310
What does this take?

81
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:26,110
I swear, that sentry is up here somewhere.

82
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:30,270
Maybe I'm just crazy and it was a heavy behind me or something.

83
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:32,270
No, it's definitely up here.

84
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:33,270
They have a teleport.

85
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:34,270
They're all kinds of guys.

86
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:37,090
They got a lot of things up here.

87
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:38,090
Oh boy.

88
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:40,090
Oh my God.

89
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:41,090
Oh my God.

90
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:42,090
Screw the spy.

91
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:44,090
We got to take this stuff out.

92
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:45,090
No!

93
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:48,090
Liberty launcher, this is not the good place for you.

94
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:50,219
Oh, I got one sentry.

95
00:03:50,219 --> 00:03:54,509
Oh my God.

96
00:03:54,509 --> 00:03:56,580
Damn.

97
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:58,460
Oh, we got to...

98
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:01,219
Just trying to wall bang this guy.

99
00:04:01,219 --> 00:04:02,219
Come on.

100
00:04:02,219 --> 00:04:03,650
No, I got the other sentry.

101
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:04,650
Oh, you got him.

102
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:05,650
I got the engie.

103
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:06,650
I got it.

104
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:07,650
Oh, spy.

105
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:08,650
Both of them down.

106
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:09,650
Both sentry down, though.

107
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:10,650
Two spies up there.

108
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:13,460
Oh, there's a guy disguised as me.

109
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:15,659
Doctor...

110
00:04:15,659 --> 00:04:16,660
If you see a demo man.

111
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:17,660
What was that guy's name?

112
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:18,660
Doctor Octo...

113
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:22,589
Octomagopus?

114
00:04:22,589 --> 00:04:23,589
Rocket jump.

115
00:04:23,589 --> 00:04:24,589
Rocket jump.

116
00:04:24,589 --> 00:04:27,220
Right on top of the health.

117
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:28,220
That was my plan.

118
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:29,220
Grabby.

119
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:30,970
Oh, watch out.

120
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:31,970
That medic.

121
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:32,970
Where are you going?

122
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:33,970
That medic.

123
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:36,970
Oh man, that medic just backed up into hell.

124
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:44,990
Oh, you bastard.

125
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:47,990
Possibly a spy disguised as me, a demo man.

126
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:48,990
Okay.

127
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:51,810
Oh, there's a spy disguised as a soldier.

128
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:52,810
What?

129
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:53,810
What?

130
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:54,810
What the...

131
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:58,810
All right, I want everyone to go back and watch that.

132
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:02,350
That guy, he was reloading.

133
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:09,350
And it looked like he was putting his hand down on the dispenser to sap it.

134
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:12,350
That was one of the oddest things I've ever seen.

135
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:14,350
Oh, you stupid spy.

136
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:17,100
You are not dead.

137
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,860
That was ridiculous.

138
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:24,550
Man, we got to get a push here.

139
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:28,220
We're just stuck in the alleyways.

140
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:30,620
Anything else?

141
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:36,439
Get rid of all this garbage here.

142
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:39,439
Heavy medic and a pyro coming as well through the tunnel.

143
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:42,620
I got the pyro.

144
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:43,620
Oh, a spy.

145
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:45,790
Man, they don't really have anything here, do they?

146
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:47,790
It just dropped down.

147
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:50,420
Get on this cot, get on this cot.

148
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:52,420
Push it, baby, push it.

149
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:54,420
You've got to push it.

150
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:56,420
You've got to push it.

151
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:58,420
Heavy medic and pyro on the bridge.

152
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:01,230
That medic is insane.

153
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:03,230
What's he doing?

154
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:04,230
Nothing I could do there.

155
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:05,230
I got one kill.

156
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:06,860
It's almost there.

157
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:08,860
It's almost there.

158
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:09,860
Are we going to close it?

159
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:11,860
Oh, no, I'm out of coffee.

160
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:16,920
Four and a half minutes.

161
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:17,920
We got this, boo.

162
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,920
Center's gone down.

163
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:22,500
I'll change from demo.

164
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,500
Oh, my phone's ringing.

165
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,259
My phone's always just ringing.

166
00:06:26,259 --> 00:06:30,069
It's either Burger Boy or like Mama Germ.

167
00:06:30,069 --> 00:06:32,720
Where are you going?

168
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,730
Where are you going?

169
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:35,730
Where are you going?

170
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:40,120
I'm just going to club this guy right in the face.

171
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,509
I kind of did.

172
00:06:42,509 --> 00:06:44,329
We're going to get it.

173
00:06:44,329 --> 00:06:45,329
We're going to get it.

174
00:06:45,329 --> 00:06:47,529
This is it.

175
00:06:47,529 --> 00:06:49,529
Oh, don't uber me on the cart.

176
00:06:49,529 --> 00:06:51,600
Nice.

177
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,600
Nice job, team.

178
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,160
Good job, dudes.

179
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,829
Yeah.

180
00:06:57,829 --> 00:06:59,519
All right.

181
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:02,519
Well, that's going to wrap it up here for Facecam Fortress 2, Monday's edition.

182
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:04,519
Boo, thanks for joining me.

183
00:07:04,519 --> 00:07:05,519
I'm looking at the camera.

184
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:06,519
I don't even know where I'm looking.

185
00:07:06,519 --> 00:07:08,519

Oh, I just...

198
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,250
