1
00:00:25,589 --> 00:00:40,090
Now it didn't take me 15 minutes to write a tweet. I wanted to make sure that my drink was chilled, cool, cold, didn't have any ice, put it into the freezer.

2
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:48,460
I was told don't do that because your drink will explode. And I was just like, what? This is just baiting me for something weird, right? Like, what do you mean?

3
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:57,130
Dude, don't put your drink in the freezer for five minutes. It's gonna explode.

4
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:09,420
What? And then I was told, well, if you put a can or, you know, something that has, you know, compressed air, don't do that, right? Of course.

5
00:01:10,599 --> 00:01:20,099
But this is just me putting a cup in the freezer for like five minutes to chill it out. It is true. It's true. Well, don't be careful then. I didn't know that.

6
00:01:20,099 --> 00:01:36,540
I mean, I knew about if you like a can of soda, you don't want to really do that. Good night, Jerma. You going to bed? Well, good night. See you later.

7
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:48,799
You're going to bed? We're about to watch television commercials from 1980 to 2000. You're going to bed?

8
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:55,299
All right. Probably got something to do. Whatever you're doing. Have a good night. It's five in the morning right now.

9
00:01:55,299 --> 00:02:09,500
I don't know. Where could you be right now where it's five a.m.? We're like, Hawaii? Is Hawaii like, well, how far back is Hawaii from right now?

10
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:16,379
Asia? Would it be? No, it'd be earlier. It'd be like, wouldn't it be like one or two, two o'clock in the morning?

11
00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:31,319
What time is it in Hawaii right now? Right now? Five a.m. in Australia.

12
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:41,349
Okay. This always confuses me. Isn't Australia is ahead of the United States, right?

13
00:02:41,349 --> 00:02:54,659
It's technically it's like 14 or 15 hours ahead, not behind. So it's is it right now? Is it the seventh?

14
00:02:54,659 --> 00:03:07,020
It's the seventh in Australia and New Zealand. Depends on your perspective. Five a.m. in Iceland. Yes. Okay.

15
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:17,319
So this is your perspective. So at what point you don't go backwards to go forwards, right?

16
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:23,319
Well, I guess you kind of do. What time is it right now in Asia like Japan, China?

17
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:30,759
Like, what time is it right now? And is it it's the sixth, right? Is it still the sixth?

18
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:40,139
Is it the fifth in Asia? No, it's six a.m. in Korea. Is there anywhere on Earth?

19
00:03:40,139 --> 00:03:44,139
That's actually a pretty interesting thing to talk about. Is there a place?

20
00:03:44,139 --> 00:03:49,139
Is there more than a few places on Earth where it's over the course of three days?

21
00:03:49,139 --> 00:03:56,139
Like, is there a time period where it's the fifth in this place, the sixth in this place and the seventh in this place?

22
00:03:56,139 --> 00:04:11,639
There's no magic kind of hour where that happens. Sorry. That fucking hurt.

23
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:22,560
Are you high? No. What are you talking about? I'm sorry. I looked over.

24
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,560
Look, I'm just like kind of getting here. I'm getting ready for the day, getting ready to the stream.

25
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:32,560
I'm talking about this. I look over at the mod chat and I've never seen this before.

26
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,740
So they're just kind of like, what is he talking about? What I saw?

27
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:40,740
VR Josh wrote ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

28
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:45,740
I'm like at least eight or nine has I've never seen that over here.

29
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:53,560
That's never happened. It was like this is no.

30
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:57,560
Dr. Clay, what the fuck are you talking about? No one is three days ahead.

31
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:07,000
No, no, no, no. Let me listen. What I mean by that is, is there just let me explain for one second before it freaks out.

32
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,370
So right now, OK, four hours ago, five hours ago,

33
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:23,870
when it was eleven fifty nine p.m. in China, it is technically the fifth over there.

34
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:28,870
It is then about six or seven a.m. here, which is the sixth.

35
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:41,259
And Australia, it's the seventh right at eleven fifty nine p.m. in China.

36
00:05:41,259 --> 00:05:46,689
I'm asking, is there a period where it's like the time zones go over a few days?

37
00:05:46,689 --> 00:05:56,430
He's dumb. No, what the fuck? You idiot. Australia, the 24 hour cycle.

38
00:05:56,430 --> 00:06:06,449
It's 24 hours. I know, but I'm saying in that 24 hour period, is it possible?

39
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:15,939
Dude, there aren't two sons. No, that's not what I'm saying.

40
00:06:15,939 --> 00:06:20,939
I need to like write this down because I feel like you're all wrong. I feel like you're all wrong.

41
00:06:20,939 --> 00:06:30,879
If I take a plane and travel the world, the entire globe and beat the time zones, is it still the day it was for me on the plane?

42
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:41,740
Precisely. Exactly. OK, everybody shut up.

43
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:51,649
We're watching commercials today. What are you saying? You're exploiting a glitch.

44
00:06:51,649 --> 00:07:00,730
I need to like write this down. Eleven fifty nine p.m. in China is seven a.m.

45
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:07,670
in the United States, which is the next day in Australia.

46
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:19,709
Somebody help me here. Oh, excuse me. Thank you, scientists that came in and fixed this.

47
00:07:19,709 --> 00:07:29,709
For the two hours between ten and eleven fifty nine UTC each day, three different days are observed at the same time in different places.

48
00:07:29,709 --> 00:07:39,709
For example, at UTC time Thursday, ten fifteen, it is Wednesday, twenty three fifteen in American Samoa, UTC minus eleven,

49
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:52,709
and Friday, zero zero colon fifteen in Kiritimati, which is UTC plus fourteen for the first hour, UTC ten o'clock to dash ten colon fifty nine.

50
00:07:52,709 --> 00:07:56,709
This is true for both inhabited and uninhabited territories.

51
00:07:56,709 --> 00:08:05,709
But during the second hour, UTC eleven colon zero zero dash eleven fifty nine, it is only true in an uninhabited maritime time zone.

52
00:08:05,709 --> 00:08:07,709
Twelve hours behind UTC, UTC minus twelve.

53
00:08:07,709 --> 00:08:12,100
So there you go. You just got absolutely decimated.

54
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:21,529
I win. I win. I win. I win. I win. I'm. I was right.

55
00:08:21,529 --> 00:08:38,019
There was a scientist came in. No one cares. I do.

56
00:08:38,019 --> 00:08:47,190
It would be funny. Yeah, somebody got it right.

57
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:50,009
That's a prank. No, it's over.

58
00:08:50,009 --> 00:08:55,309
There are three observed days in one day in one small period.

59
00:08:55,309 --> 00:08:57,679
Explain what you just read without reading it.

60
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:08,200
OK, so there are boats and I don't know as I'm right.

61
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:16,610
I'm right. All I know is that I'm right.

62
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:24,539
I have my reasoning when it's twelve when it's eleven fifty nine p.m. in China.

63
00:09:24,539 --> 00:09:33,490
It is therefore colon eleven dash zero zero UTC four a.m.

64
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:37,519
You got it right here. Somebody has it as an image.

65
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:41,269
Look at this. Look at this shit. Look at this shit. You ready for this?

66
00:09:41,269 --> 00:09:44,269
Oh, you guys are in trouble now. The overlapping time zones.

67
00:09:44,269 --> 00:09:51,940
Here it comes. Hold on. Let me get this on screen.

68
00:09:51,940 --> 00:10:00,429
Oops. OK, here we go. So here it is. Check this out.

69
00:10:00,429 --> 00:10:04,429
I would like all the people that just unsubscribed and unfollowed

70
00:10:04,429 --> 00:10:06,429
because this guy is such a moron.

71
00:10:06,429 --> 00:10:08,429
There's no way he can't even tie his shoes every day.

72
00:10:08,429 --> 00:10:31,860
I want you to look at this. What are the filters on this?

73
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:37,820
They look. Oh, excuse me. Oh, excuse me. What happened?

74
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:42,450
What's this? Oh, is this the overlapping time zones where that shows you

75
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:49,450
we have three. We observe three different days. Interesting. Interesting.

76
00:10:49,450 --> 00:11:07,350
Explain that. This is the middle of the ocean next to Alaska.

77
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:13,580
There are three observable days. Thirteen.

78
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:23,950
Explain what a time zone is. Time is a no, it's not.

79
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:27,789
What? Address the Eminem, please.

80
00:11:27,789 --> 00:11:30,789
The last image that was saved here and I just clicked it.

81
00:11:30,789 --> 00:11:37,980
I thought I watched a video on this. Yeah, everyone's calling me crazy.

82
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:40,980
This is how it's actually this. There's more than two observable days.

83
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:44,980
And like for an hour a day in a very specific time period,

84
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:47,980
which is very much explained in this graph,

85
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:53,059
which if you can't understand what this means, I mean, I do.

86
00:11:53,059 --> 00:11:58,419
So on the left side of the line, it could be 1201 a.m. on January 3rd.

87
00:11:58,419 --> 00:12:01,419
It would be January 2nd on most of the earth.

88
00:12:01,419 --> 00:12:06,419
But the right side of the line would still be about 1101 p.m. January 1st.

89
00:12:06,419 --> 00:12:14,600
You guys ready to watch commercials?

90
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:24,279
Bro, just watch the commercials. There's so many people here that got like popcorn and drink.

91
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:28,580
Like they're sitting around like a bunch of people waiting.

92
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:37,269
And she's like, I don't want to, I don't want to do this.

93
00:12:37,269 --> 00:12:42,090
Belly belt, that is unbelievably funny. I'm going to have to steal this.

94
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:51,679
I'm Tom Scott and I'm currently standing in the middle of the ocean during three simultaneous days.

95
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:57,909
Behind me is a big boat.

96
00:12:57,909 --> 00:13:01,909
And that, that title, Tom Scott, that's a great video idea.

97
00:13:01,909 --> 00:13:07,909
The title of that video is this video is over, like something about three days.

98
00:13:07,909 --> 00:13:10,909
You know what I mean? Like it is three days long in this video.

99
00:13:10,909 --> 00:13:17,799
Something, right? Like this video, it is three days on this video.

100
00:13:17,799 --> 00:13:19,799
I don't know. He's so much smarter than I am. He'll be able to do it.

101
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:23,769
He would have a banger title for that too.

102
00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:30,169
You know it would be super informative.

103
00:13:30,169 --> 00:13:33,169
It would break everything down like incredibly well.

104
00:13:33,169 --> 00:13:35,169
It would be so detailed. I would understand it so easily.

105
00:13:35,169 --> 00:13:45,919
This video took three days to film. Yeah. Perfect.

106
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:48,720
Wow. Cool. All right. You guys ready?

107
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,720
We're going to watch commercials. We're going to watch infomercials.

108
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,720
We've done this before.

109
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:56,960
And it was confirmed that everybody told me that this was one of the best things I've ever done,

110
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,960
which is all right.

111
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:02,779
Like, hey, what's, what's the, what's your, hey, community.

112
00:14:02,779 --> 00:14:08,210
What's the, your favorite thing I have ever done ever in the last 12 years?

113
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:10,700
The time that you watched infomercials on stream.

114
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:14,519
So, I mean, have to give the people what they want sometimes, right?

115
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:19,149
So here it is. These are, there's a collection.

116
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:23,460
And I didn't know this, but I mean, look at the title of this.

117
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:27,590
This is volume number 956.

118
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:30,600
There's a lot of these.

119
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:34,309
So, got some content for a little while, I think.

120
00:14:34,309 --> 00:14:40,669
What are you saying?

121
00:14:40,669 --> 00:14:43,940
You wish my wife a Merry Christmas.

122
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:45,940
Have a Merry Christmas.

123
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:50,100
All right. Just click, click, play.

124
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:53,039
No, I'm not ready.

125
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:57,200
I need to explain what's happening today.

126
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,200
Dude, did you pirate Elden Ring?

127
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:04,110
What? What are you talking about?

128
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:09,950
No, I've, I've bought it the day one.

129
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:11,950
I like I bought it two days.

130
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:15,220
What do you mean? Prove it.

131
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:21,230
I played it on Steam.

132
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:22,230
No, there's no wall penis.

133
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:23,230
I would show you.

134
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:29,580
Okay.

135
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:30,580
So here we go.

136
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:31,580
This is 80s commercials.

137
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:32,580
We're going to break these down.

138
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:33,580
I'm going to be frequently pausing.

139
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:37,389
Those of you that are just going to be pissed off with my pausing.

140
00:15:37,389 --> 00:15:38,389
And we're going to begin.

141
00:15:38,389 --> 00:15:39,389
Look, we had to spend a little bit.

142
00:15:39,389 --> 00:15:45,220
We had to have people trickle in to hang out.

143
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:50,100
All right.

144
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:51,100
One more image and we'll go.

145
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:52,100
One more image.

146
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,100
This is pretty good, too.

147
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,100
We're going to wait for this people.

148
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:59,159
Everyone's like favorite stream ever.

149
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:01,159
Imagine if we didn't stall for like 15 minutes.

150
00:16:01,159 --> 00:16:07,460
This is a good one, though.

151
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:11,830
Oh, shit.

152
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:12,830
What have I done?

153
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:14,009
No, I'm good.

154
00:16:14,009 --> 00:16:18,769
Where is it?

155
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:20,460
There it is.

156
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:31,490
Green M&M.

157
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:32,490
Live here.

158
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:33,490
Sun up.

159
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:34,490
Auto.

160
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:35,490
Live here.

161
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:36,490
Sundown.

162
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:37,490
Live here.

163
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:44,809
Midnight.

164
00:16:44,809 --> 00:16:48,419
Boat.

165
00:16:48,419 --> 00:16:49,419
Earth.

166
00:16:49,419 --> 00:16:50,419
Some of you guys got really into that.

167
00:16:50,419 --> 00:16:51,419
And I'm telling you, I was correct.

168
00:16:51,419 --> 00:16:56,500
Auto.

169
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:59,590
Live here.

170
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:00,590
All right.

171
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:02,019
You guys ready?

172
00:17:02,019 --> 00:17:03,019
It's time to watch some commercials.

173
00:17:04,259 --> 00:17:07,849
Some of these are actually Christmas related.

174
00:17:07,849 --> 00:17:10,849
So, I mean, a lot of ads happen on Christmas time.

175
00:17:10,849 --> 00:17:12,859
And let's see.

176
00:17:12,859 --> 00:17:14,859
I don't know what these are.

177
00:17:14,859 --> 00:17:15,859
I have no idea.

178
00:17:15,859 --> 00:17:16,859
I know as much as you do.

179
00:17:16,859 --> 00:17:17,859
But I do.

180
00:17:17,859 --> 00:17:18,859
I'm going to remember some of these, I think.

181
00:17:18,859 --> 00:17:19,859
Maybe not the 80s ones, but the 90s ones.

182
00:17:19,859 --> 00:17:23,099
Finally, time that person out for one second.

183
00:17:23,099 --> 00:17:24,529
Ready?

184
00:17:24,529 --> 00:17:26,089
Here we go.

185
00:17:26,089 --> 00:17:28,480
Make sure you can hear it.

186
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,480
We'll do it.

187
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,660
It's ad.

188
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:35,539
It's just ad roulette.

189
00:17:35,539 --> 00:17:41,539
Mr. T and Emanuel Lewis in a Christmas dream, sponsored in part by all your friends at

190
00:17:42,539 --> 00:17:43,539
Okay.

191
00:17:55,960 --> 00:18:00,819
Oh, his damage.

192
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:14,130
So they had damageable chests?

193
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,640
Good source of vitamin A.

194
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,640
That's important.

195
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,640
And another thing.

196
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,640
What?

197
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,640
It tastes good.

198
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:35,390
Ma'am, I'll have a bowl of that Campbell's soup, please.

199
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:36,390
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait a minute.

200
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:37,390
Wait a minute.

201
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:38,390
Wait a minute.

202
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:41,230
Wait a minute.

203
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:42,230
Wait a minute.

204
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:43,230
Are they eating Campbell's soup at a diner?

205
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:46,230
Why is the diner serving Campbell's soup?

206
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:53,500
So you go, they go into the restaurant and they order.

207
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,809
Oh, I'll have the soup, please.

208
00:18:54,809 --> 00:18:59,809
And it's just they they dumped it into the into a big container.

209
00:18:59,809 --> 00:19:01,430
Hold on.

210
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:02,799
Good for you.

211
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:03,799
Oh, it's good for you.

212
00:19:03,799 --> 00:19:04,799
Lunch.

213
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:06,799
Oh, by the way, lunch of champions.

214
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:08,359
This is on the news.

215
00:19:08,359 --> 00:19:09,359
This is all over the news.

216
00:19:09,359 --> 00:19:11,359
It's literally all over the news.

217
00:19:12,789 --> 00:19:14,789
That actually kind of looks gross.

218
00:19:15,789 --> 00:19:17,789
Doesn't that kind of look like shit?

219
00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:21,309
That's not like a good photo.

220
00:19:21,309 --> 00:19:27,609
But wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

221
00:19:27,609 --> 00:19:31,609
That says Campbell's vegetable beef soup's a real good source of vitamin A.

222
00:19:31,609 --> 00:19:32,609
That's important.

223
00:19:32,609 --> 00:19:33,609
Okay.

224
00:19:33,609 --> 00:19:34,609
And another thing.

225
00:19:34,609 --> 00:19:35,609
What?

226
00:19:35,609 --> 00:19:36,609
It tastes good.

227
00:19:36,609 --> 00:19:37,609
Right?

228
00:19:37,609 --> 00:19:39,609
Ma'am, I'll have a bowl of that Campbell's soup, please.

229
00:19:39,609 --> 00:19:44,940
This look at all the cans.

230
00:19:48,609 --> 00:19:53,680
Isn't the whole point of going to a restaurant that you wouldn't be served

231
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:56,680
Campbell's out of a can dumped into a container heated up?

232
00:19:56,680 --> 00:20:04,869
I'm very confused by this one.

233
00:20:04,869 --> 00:20:08,009
This is just a kitchen cabinet.

234
00:20:08,009 --> 00:20:10,009
And let me I'm going to be very, very clear about this.

235
00:20:10,009 --> 00:20:13,019
I Campbell's soup is great.

236
00:20:13,019 --> 00:20:15,509
Campbell's soup, chicken noodle, tomato.

237
00:20:15,509 --> 00:20:17,509
I grew up on this.

238
00:20:17,509 --> 00:20:18,509
I love this stuff.

239
00:20:18,509 --> 00:20:20,900
But this is weird.

240
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:26,410
This is very strange to say like, oh, yeah, we're at the diner.

241
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:27,410
Oh, don't you know?

242
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:29,410
By the way, I'm like some random like sheriff.

243
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:30,410
Oh, yeah.

244
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:31,410
Don't you know?

245
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:33,480
It's got vitamin A in it.

246
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,480
It's like, why?

247
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,480
Why are we talking right now?

248
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:41,019
Why are you telling me about this?

249
00:20:41,019 --> 00:20:43,650
Eat carefully.

250
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:45,650
Eat carefully.

251
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:49,359
That was weird.

252
00:20:49,359 --> 00:20:53,359
Here it comes to Diet Coke with 100% Nutri-Sweet.

253
00:20:53,359 --> 00:20:55,359
A taste that's one of a kind.

254
00:20:56,359 --> 00:20:57,359
Wait, this.

255
00:20:57,359 --> 00:20:59,359
Why is there a jet?

256
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:11,990
These dances.

257
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:15,869
Oh, do you remember when America went to the moon?

258
00:21:15,869 --> 00:21:20,819
That was a lot in that one.

259
00:21:20,819 --> 00:21:23,859
Hold on.

260
00:21:23,859 --> 00:21:27,930
The thing about soda commercials that I think is just so strange.

261
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:29,930
And I know chip commercials do stuff like this, too.

262
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:35,559
But it's like, who cares about any of this?

263
00:21:35,559 --> 00:21:36,859
Right.

264
00:21:36,859 --> 00:21:39,549
Just just drink the soda.

265
00:21:39,549 --> 00:21:40,549
It's good.

266
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:44,500
Like you ever see the like the this is a completely different tangent.

267
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:51,670
But you see like the chip commercials where they have the it's like, oh, well, here's here's like a potato chip commercial.

268
00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:55,039
And it's always a couple of celebrities.

269
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:58,039
And they're just they're way too obsessed with these bags.

270
00:21:58,039 --> 00:22:00,039
They're way too obsessed with this shit.

271
00:22:00,039 --> 00:22:03,730
They hold they hold it vertically.

272
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:08,720
They hold the bags vertically at the bottom like this.

273
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:12,900
They like they cup it like this and it stands straight up.

274
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,900
The bag always looks like it's made out of glass.

275
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:17,069
It's this weird tube.

276
00:22:17,069 --> 00:22:18,819
It's like, look at these celebrities.

277
00:22:18,819 --> 00:22:19,819
They eat chips.

278
00:22:19,819 --> 00:22:22,089
So do I.

279
00:22:22,089 --> 00:22:23,089
Who fucking cares?

280
00:22:23,089 --> 00:22:24,089
So do I.

281
00:22:24,089 --> 00:22:26,089
Who cares that celebrities eat chips?

282
00:22:26,089 --> 00:22:27,089
Who cares?

283
00:22:27,089 --> 00:22:28,390
I do, too.

284
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:29,569
You do.

285
00:22:29,569 --> 00:22:31,569
It's not like a thing that we have to I don't get it.

286
00:22:31,569 --> 00:22:34,569
It's the same kind of world with soda commercials.

287
00:22:34,569 --> 00:22:36,740
People are like partying.

288
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:39,049
Everyone's having such a good time.

289
00:22:39,049 --> 00:22:42,049
Look at where we went to space that time.

290
00:22:42,049 --> 00:22:44,049
It's like just just drink the drink.

291
00:22:46,049 --> 00:22:48,539
This is a lady taking a take.

292
00:22:48,539 --> 00:22:49,539
What was she doing?

293
00:22:49,539 --> 00:22:53,539
Was that like a waterfall taking like a waterfall shower?

294
00:22:53,539 --> 00:22:56,539
What was that?

295
00:22:56,539 --> 00:23:01,319
What does this have to do with drinking soda?

296
00:23:01,319 --> 00:23:11,500
You know, it would be a much better commercial.

297
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:12,500
And I'm serious.

298
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:13,500
Get me on the marketing team.

299
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,990
Just do what everybody does.

300
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:19,750
This just have a guy.

301
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:20,750
You have a guy.

302
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:22,750
Girl, no matter sitting down on a couch.

303
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:25,119
It's just kind of dark in the room.

304
00:23:25,119 --> 00:23:26,619
And have him just go like this.

305
00:23:26,619 --> 00:23:49,259
This would be more realistic.

306
00:23:49,259 --> 00:23:51,259
That would actually be a terrible commercial.

307
00:23:51,259 --> 00:23:52,259
You know what I mean?

308
00:23:52,259 --> 00:24:11,500
Just like the side air burp that everybody does.

309
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:15,500
The bad thing about television is that everybody you see on television

310
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:19,500
is doing something better than what you're doing.

311
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:22,500
You ever see anyone on TV like just sliding off the front of the sofa

312
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,500
with potato chip crumbs on their face?

313
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,500
Some people have a little too much fun on television.

314
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,500
The soda commercial people.

315
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:32,500
Where do they summon this enthusiasm?

316
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:33,500
Have you seen them?

317
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,500
We have soda.

318
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,500
We have soda.

319
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:36,500
We have soda.

320
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:40,500
Jumping, laughing, flying through the air.

321
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:44,130
It's a can of soda.

322
00:24:44,130 --> 00:24:46,130
Have you ever been standing there and you're watching TV

323
00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:50,130
and you're drinking the exact product that they're advertising

324
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:52,130
right there on TV?

325
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:54,130
And it's like, you know, they're spiking volleyballs,

326
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:57,130
jet skiing, girls in bikinis.

327
00:24:57,130 --> 00:24:58,130
And I'm standing there.

328
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:02,539
He's right.

329
00:25:02,539 --> 00:25:07,640
What, you can't have the same take?

330
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:14,170
I actually do like the...

331
00:25:14,170 --> 00:25:18,940
Is that the American flag?

332
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:25,259
Dude, people slam sodas in commercials too, by the way.

333
00:25:25,259 --> 00:25:26,259
Have you ever noticed that?

334
00:25:26,259 --> 00:25:30,619
People go like slam, slam, slam, slam.

335
00:25:30,619 --> 00:25:33,619
And you're telling me there's not going to be a real gross side burp after that?

336
00:25:33,619 --> 00:25:36,700
They're full of shit.

337
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:56,140
What's that?

338
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:59,529
Why is Q-Bird in this?

339
00:25:59,529 --> 00:26:03,940
Who's the weird Q-Bird guy?

340
00:26:24,119 --> 00:26:28,119
Why would you have a hamburger under the tree?

341
00:26:28,119 --> 00:26:30,119
This is a weird present.

342
00:26:30,119 --> 00:26:34,119
And the hamburger looks upside down, but right side up at the same time.

343
00:26:34,119 --> 00:26:37,819
I wouldn't put my food on the ground.

344
00:26:37,819 --> 00:26:39,819
Can you imagine waking up on Christmas morning?

345
00:26:39,819 --> 00:26:43,980
It's like, all right, what have we got under the...

346
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:44,980
Let's see what's happening.

347
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:48,049
Everyone's so exciting.

348
00:26:48,049 --> 00:26:50,049
And it's like a Burger King or like a Hardee's or whatever.

349
00:26:50,049 --> 00:26:53,049
It's on the ground in front of the tree.

350
00:26:53,049 --> 00:26:56,359
I can understand a bag, right?

351
00:26:56,359 --> 00:26:58,359
There's a bag of Hardee's or a bag of Hardee's.

352
00:26:58,359 --> 00:27:03,140
I can understand a bag of Hardee's or a bag of Hardee's.

353
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:09,140
There's a bag of Hardee's or a bag of Burger King, but it on the ground?

354
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:15,009
I don't know about that.

355
00:27:17,009 --> 00:27:20,009
By the way, I've never had Hardee's before, not once.

356
00:27:26,009 --> 00:27:28,009
I've never eaten it before.

357
00:27:28,009 --> 00:27:29,009
That's a lie. No, it's not.

358
00:27:29,009 --> 00:27:31,009
I have never eaten Hardee's or Carl's Jr.

359
00:27:31,009 --> 00:27:33,009
Never in my entire life.

360
00:27:37,009 --> 00:27:41,009
It's mid.

361
00:27:41,009 --> 00:27:42,009
I've never had it.

362
00:27:42,009 --> 00:27:44,009
They just look huge.

363
00:27:44,009 --> 00:27:47,009
Everything looks gigantic in Hardee's portions.

364
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:03,400
All right, I like this one.

365
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:07,400
This one's more realistic, but it's funny because the kid didn't get a single bit in his mouth.

366
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:11,400
You eat all that soup and maybe you'll be okay.

367
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:16,400
He picked it up a little too fast and it all dumped and he just, oh, shit, there's nothing there.

368
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,900
Wet and cold and hungry.

369
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:21,900
Very few things are more satisfying than a hot, very beautiful love.

370
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:22,900
That one's actually pretty good.

371
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:24,900
Campbell's tomato soup.

372
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:28,900
Do you still love me anymore?

373
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:30,900
Soup is good food.

374
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:32,900
What?

375
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:35,900
It's a world of celebration.

376
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:37,900
What?

377
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:39,900
What?

378
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:40,900
Hold on.

379
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:42,900
Why?

380
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:44,900
Do you still love me anymore?

381
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:47,650
Soup is good food.

382
00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:49,650
That was strange.

383
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:59,769
It's a world of celebration.

384
00:28:59,769 --> 00:29:01,769
Everybody said, she didn't say yes.

385
00:29:01,769 --> 00:29:04,769
A hot, nourishing bowl of Campbell's tomato soup.

386
00:29:06,769 --> 00:29:09,009
Do you still love me anymore?

387
00:29:09,009 --> 00:29:13,869
Soup is good food.

388
00:29:13,869 --> 00:29:15,869
God damn it.

389
00:29:19,119 --> 00:29:44,180
Are they making it in their house?

390
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:46,180
That was in the same house.

391
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:49,130
They made it in the house.

392
00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:56,039
You know what's awesome about these ad compilation videos?

393
00:29:56,039 --> 00:30:00,039
You can tell what they taped.

394
00:30:00,039 --> 00:30:02,039
This is what they taped.

395
00:30:02,039 --> 00:30:07,039
You can see the intro and the outro of what show they were actually taping and cut out.

396
00:30:08,039 --> 00:30:20,279
If you're looking at video cassette recorders and you're confused by all your choices,

397
00:30:20,279 --> 00:30:23,279
just look at the most important feature of all.

398
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:25,279
The picture.

399
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:28,279
And Sony Betamax records a sharper picture than VHS.

400
00:30:28,279 --> 00:30:30,279
That's not just my opinion.

401
00:30:30,279 --> 00:30:36,279
In tests throughout the country, more people said the picture was sharper with Sony Betamax than VHS.

402
00:30:36,279 --> 00:30:39,279
So why doesn't anyone else talk sharper pictures?

403
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:42,279
Because no one else can.

404
00:30:42,279 --> 00:30:45,279
Betamax, a sharper picture.

405
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:47,279
What?

406
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:52,000
What happened with Betamax?

407
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Betamax was supposed to be better than VHS.

408
00:30:54,000 --> 00:31:00,230
And people just didn't care?

409
00:31:00,230 --> 00:31:02,230
The guy in the commercial even says it.

410
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:05,230
He's like, how come more people aren't talking about Betamax?

411
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:07,230
Because we're better than them.

412
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:14,619
In tests throughout the country, more people said the picture was sharper with Sony Betamax than VHS.

413
00:31:14,619 --> 00:31:17,619
So why doesn't anyone else talk sharper pictures?

414
00:31:17,619 --> 00:31:19,619
Because no one else can.

415
00:31:19,619 --> 00:31:21,619
Betamax, a sharper picture.

416
00:31:21,619 --> 00:31:23,619
It was too expensive.

417
00:31:23,619 --> 00:31:25,619
Oh, that's what killed it.

418
00:31:25,619 --> 00:31:27,619
Jimmy Carter on the Cuban agreement. I love him.

419
00:31:27,619 --> 00:31:30,619
Betamax was better, but it was not as cheap.

420
00:31:30,619 --> 00:31:38,750
Interesting.

421
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:42,140
Get in class!

422
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:44,140
What the fuck are you kids doing in the hallway?

423
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:46,140
You can't control your feelings.

424
00:31:46,140 --> 00:32:03,809
Get off the desk!

425
00:32:03,809 --> 00:32:16,210
Food's not even...

426
00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:18,210
Can you not eat in school?

427
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:33,819
Oh, there's after school.

428
00:32:33,819 --> 00:32:44,259
Alright, I will say...

429
00:32:44,259 --> 00:32:48,259
I would do something like this.

430
00:32:48,259 --> 00:32:50,259
I would.

431
00:32:50,259 --> 00:32:53,259
If I was hanging out with friends or something, we would like, well, come on in.

432
00:32:53,259 --> 00:32:55,500
Go on there.

433
00:32:55,500 --> 00:33:14,779
I would do that.

434
00:33:14,779 --> 00:33:18,089
Looking out the window, like, Dad's out there with the big mower?

435
00:33:18,089 --> 00:33:21,650
And he's just like, Dad, what are you doing out there?

436
00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:23,650
He's so excited to cut the grass?

437
00:33:23,650 --> 00:33:26,400
No, that's a tractor.

438
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,400
But still...

439
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,400
I guess you're just kind of vibing out.

440
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:35,900
But why the guy in the tractor?

441
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:39,809
The Cuban agreement. I love him.

442
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:41,809
Hanson, here we are.

443
00:33:41,809 --> 00:33:43,809
We're at school.

444
00:33:43,809 --> 00:33:45,809
School.

445
00:33:45,809 --> 00:33:47,809
School.

446
00:33:47,809 --> 00:33:53,119
School.

447
00:33:53,119 --> 00:33:55,119
School.

448
00:33:57,119 --> 00:34:00,190
School.

449
00:34:00,190 --> 00:34:11,889
Way to school!

450
00:34:11,889 --> 00:34:13,889
Where? Studying in school. Kids studying in school.

451
00:34:13,889 --> 00:34:16,449
Oh, it's like after school. Guy in a tractor.

452
00:34:16,449 --> 00:34:19,010
Why is this guy here?

453
00:34:19,010 --> 00:34:21,010
School dance.

454
00:34:21,010 --> 00:34:23,010
School.

455
00:34:23,010 --> 00:34:25,309
In school.

456
00:34:25,309 --> 00:34:28,449
After school.

457
00:34:28,449 --> 00:34:30,449
We're coming out of school.

458
00:34:30,449 --> 00:34:32,449
This isn't a school.

459
00:34:32,449 --> 00:34:34,449
Where's the guy in the tractor?

460
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:42,780
How do they get McDonald's at school?

461
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:44,780
I don't know.

462
00:35:03,519 --> 00:35:06,210
This is one of those products that

463
00:35:06,210 --> 00:35:08,510
the parent that buys it doesn't read the box.

464
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:10,510
It doesn't see the commercial.

465
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:12,510
And realizes that it makes that kind of sound.

466
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:14,940
And then they go,

467
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:18,139
Well, this sucks because now I'm going to have to listen to this.

468
00:35:18,139 --> 00:35:20,139
And then they just take the batteries out overnight one night

469
00:35:20,139 --> 00:35:22,139
and then tell the kid,

470
00:35:22,139 --> 00:35:24,139
Oh, it's broken.

471
00:35:24,139 --> 00:35:26,139
And then the kid goes, What?

472
00:35:26,139 --> 00:35:29,150
Oh! And then they just do it normally.

473
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:31,150
And they don't need the extra added echo.

474
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:33,150
Action figures each sold separately.

475
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:35,150
From Mattel.

476
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:37,150
Bottom of Tell.

477
00:35:37,150 --> 00:35:39,150
Bottom of Tell.

478
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:44,210
More food dancing.

479
00:35:53,389 --> 00:36:10,400
Milk.

480
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,400
I mean that was alright.

481
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,400
Somebody said

482
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,400
Milk is fucking gross.

483
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,400
What?

484
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,400
Hold on.

485
00:36:36,699 --> 00:36:38,699
Why is everybody just

486
00:36:38,699 --> 00:36:40,699
chugging milk?

487
00:36:40,699 --> 00:36:50,159
Where are they?

488
00:36:50,159 --> 00:36:52,159
The questions I have with commercials like this are where are they?

489
00:36:52,159 --> 00:36:54,909
This is like Burger King,

490
00:36:54,909 --> 00:36:57,150
McDonald's, a restaurant.

491
00:36:57,150 --> 00:36:59,150
Everybody's just drinking

492
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:01,389
I guess

493
00:37:01,389 --> 00:37:03,389
They're kids?

494
00:37:03,389 --> 00:37:05,389
It's the local soda milk shop.

495
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:07,389
That's what they're going for.

496
00:37:07,389 --> 00:37:09,389
This guy, you know, he's like

497
00:37:09,389 --> 00:37:11,389
John Travolta in Grease.

498
00:37:21,099 --> 00:37:23,099
Milk.

499
00:37:23,099 --> 00:37:25,099
These two kids are hitting their heads.

500
00:37:33,099 --> 00:37:35,099
Are we bubbling spa?

501
00:38:03,099 --> 00:38:05,099
Oh!

502
00:38:05,099 --> 00:38:07,099
Wait a minute.

503
00:38:09,099 --> 00:38:11,099
That was actually a pretty good reveal.

504
00:38:14,619 --> 00:38:16,619
The kid's like look I see him, look I see him.

505
00:38:16,619 --> 00:38:18,619
He's like no, come on kid, give me a break.

506
00:38:18,619 --> 00:38:20,860
The mom sees him.

507
00:38:23,489 --> 00:38:25,730
That was a great ad.

508
00:38:25,730 --> 00:38:29,380
That was a great ad. They did a great job.

509
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:31,380
That was very clean.

510
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:33,380
It was right to the point.

511
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:35,739
Fun little plot twist.

512
00:38:35,739 --> 00:38:37,739
That's a good one.

513
00:38:37,739 --> 00:38:39,739
I'm going to give it an A-.

514
00:38:51,739 --> 00:38:53,739
That's the whole special.

515
00:38:59,739 --> 00:39:11,630
Oh my god.

516
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:20,769
Getting so many intros and outros.

517
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:40,380
Bob Hope here telling you to make sure you drink as much milk as you can.

518
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:42,380
Not the 1% stuff, not the 2% stuff.

519
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:44,380
Of course folks are talking about the full fat whole milk.

520
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:48,380
Drink it as fast as you can.

521
00:39:53,010 --> 00:39:55,010
Texaco.

522
00:39:57,010 --> 00:39:59,010
Texaco.

523
00:40:09,010 --> 00:40:11,010
Big oil.

524
00:40:11,010 --> 00:40:32,500
Why is Bob Hope presenting Texaco like it's a new museum that he's cutting the tape to be able to go to the grand opening of a museum?

525
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:49,550
The logo is already here.

526
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:55,889
Why are we revealing this?

527
00:40:55,889 --> 00:40:58,130
It's already on the sign.

528
00:41:05,329 --> 00:41:07,329
It's just this gas station.

529
00:41:19,329 --> 00:41:21,329
That's the first thing he asks.

530
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:37,539
Bob, that's the first thing you ask when the aliens land?

531
00:41:37,539 --> 00:41:41,500
Regular or unleaded.

532
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:43,500
He should have screamed.

533
00:41:50,989 --> 00:41:56,110
I don't think that's the reaction you have.

534
00:41:56,110 --> 00:41:58,110
I mean if he screamed it would have been so funny.

535
00:41:58,110 --> 00:42:05,409
If it sucked him up I think that would have been so funny.

536
00:42:05,409 --> 00:42:11,119
Regular or super unleaded.

537
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:13,119
He meant if he was like, regular or super unleaded.

538
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:18,000
They sucked him up and took off.

539
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:27,010
And then at the Christmas special that he's at right now, he's not there and he shows up like 30 minutes late with the aliens.

540
00:42:27,010 --> 00:42:32,019
And they come onto the set, they got like costumes, alien costumes, and they're wearing Texaco gear.

541
00:42:32,019 --> 00:42:34,019
Like wow, even the aliens use it.

542
00:42:34,019 --> 00:42:38,239
I probably missed an opportunity here.

543
00:42:44,719 --> 00:42:46,719
I want to say it one more time.

544
00:42:48,719 --> 00:42:51,539
Regular or super unleaded.

545
00:42:58,139 --> 00:43:02,820
He didn't even yell it.

546
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:05,059
He would need to scream this.

547
00:43:05,059 --> 00:43:10,369
He's not, they can't hear him.

548
00:43:10,369 --> 00:43:15,500
Wait, but they said it's flashing empty?

549
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:17,500
They need gas.

550
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:23,150
Regular or super unleaded.

551
00:43:23,150 --> 00:43:27,150
They stopped in the galaxy to pick up a little bit of fuel.

552
00:43:27,150 --> 00:43:32,530
Texaco history.

553
00:43:32,530 --> 00:43:34,530
Texaco system 2000.

554
00:43:34,530 --> 00:43:40,300
They run on gas.

555
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:45,099
Regular or super unleaded.

556
00:43:45,099 --> 00:43:49,099
Texaco captures a golden era for women.

557
00:43:49,099 --> 00:43:51,099
It's because the sign was so big.

558
00:43:51,099 --> 00:43:57,340
A rich rich weaving of opulent texture.

559
00:43:57,340 --> 00:44:01,340
An interlocking of elegance and style.

560
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:03,340
Of Rolex?

561
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:05,340
And the brilliant touch only a diamond can give.

562
00:44:05,340 --> 00:44:09,340
At Seiko, great technology inspires great design.

563
00:44:09,340 --> 00:44:13,340
Seiko setting the standard for the world, for the future.

564
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:19,519
Something about old commercials with the voiceover guy that had almost the bia voice.

565
00:44:19,519 --> 00:44:21,519
They always talked like this.

566
00:44:21,519 --> 00:44:27,820
The Seiko watch will finally get.

567
00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:33,820
It was so low that it was almost unbelievable how low this person is talking in these old commercials.

568
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:35,820
Technology inspires great design.

569
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:37,820
Inspire is great.

570
00:44:37,820 --> 00:44:41,820
I don't think humans can do this anymore.

571
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:45,820
Seiko setting the standard for the world, for the future.

572
00:44:45,820 --> 00:44:47,820
I can't do it.

573
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:51,090
Now Seiko gives you the moon.

574
00:44:51,090 --> 00:44:53,090
Oh, it's all the same guy.

575
00:44:53,090 --> 00:44:57,090
Of the world's first analog quartz chronograph.

576
00:44:57,090 --> 00:45:01,090
And tailors gray with dashes of gold tones.

577
00:45:01,090 --> 00:45:05,090
To an elegant dress circle.

578
00:45:05,090 --> 00:45:07,090
Seiko adds a date window.

579
00:45:07,090 --> 00:45:11,090
And creates a bold alarm chronograph to sport everywhere.

580
00:45:11,090 --> 00:45:15,090
At Seiko, great technology inspires great design.

581
00:45:15,090 --> 00:45:19,090
Seiko setting the standard for the world, for the future.

582
00:45:19,090 --> 00:45:21,090
I don't know.

583
00:45:34,739 --> 00:45:36,739
Bro, that's a lot of fire near that tree.

584
00:45:36,739 --> 00:45:42,429
To be a part of your holiday weekend.

585
00:45:42,429 --> 00:45:53,389
Lots of motor royals talk protection and mileage.

586
00:45:53,389 --> 00:45:55,389
I want proof.

587
00:45:55,389 --> 00:45:59,389
New York taxis drove over a quarter million punishing miles with no oil related failures.

588
00:45:59,389 --> 00:46:01,389
That's Havilland Supreme protection.

589
00:46:01,389 --> 00:46:03,389
Not bad, but.

590
00:46:03,389 --> 00:46:07,389
Proof, after a million miles of state trooper driving no oil related failures.

591
00:46:07,389 --> 00:46:09,389
That's Havilland Supreme protection.

592
00:46:09,389 --> 00:46:10,389
No kidding.

593
00:46:10,389 --> 00:46:14,389
Proof, in fuel economy tests it delivered improved mileage.

594
00:46:14,389 --> 00:46:15,389
I'm still skeptical.

595
00:46:15,389 --> 00:46:17,389
Texaco Havilland Supreme.

596
00:46:17,389 --> 00:46:19,389
They've got the proof.

597
00:46:19,389 --> 00:46:21,820
Monday, it's an all new Little House movie.

598
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:23,820
A two hour Christmas special.

599
00:46:23,820 --> 00:46:25,820
With the holiday spring tragedy when Laura's baby is kidnapped.

600
00:46:25,820 --> 00:46:27,820
Why did you leave her?

601
00:46:27,820 --> 00:46:30,190
Bless all the dear children, Monday.

602
00:46:31,190 --> 00:46:33,190
Holy shit, what?

603
00:46:38,190 --> 00:46:40,190
He seemed really annoyed there.

604
00:46:40,190 --> 00:46:42,190
He got proven wrong.

605
00:46:56,190 --> 00:46:58,190
Dude, that's not the problem.

606
00:47:00,190 --> 00:47:02,190
Isn't that Werner Lutz?

607
00:47:02,190 --> 00:47:04,190
We went to high school together.

608
00:47:04,190 --> 00:47:06,190
By golly, you're right. I thought Werner was dead.

609
00:47:06,190 --> 00:47:10,369
Texaco's super unleaded superstar power for more car power.

610
00:47:10,369 --> 00:47:12,369
Hi, Bob doing yourself hope here.

611
00:47:12,369 --> 00:47:21,199
And after the aliens, I'm a completely different man.

612
00:47:21,199 --> 00:47:27,860
I was going to say something about this.

613
00:47:27,860 --> 00:47:29,860
Oh, right. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

614
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:31,860
Okay, so here's the interesting thing about this.

615
00:47:31,860 --> 00:47:37,230
It doesn't matter how much gas is in your car or what kind of gas is in your car.

616
00:47:37,230 --> 00:47:43,230
If you press like a quarter of a pound of pressure on your on your gas pedal,

617
00:47:43,230 --> 00:47:45,539
you're going to go three miles per hour.

618
00:47:49,630 --> 00:47:54,380
You could have zero gas in your tank.

619
00:47:54,380 --> 00:47:56,380
I mean, like a sneeze of it.

620
00:47:56,380 --> 00:47:58,619
Just enough to get into the intake, right?

621
00:47:58,619 --> 00:48:00,929
And floor it.

622
00:48:00,929 --> 00:48:02,929
And you'd go.

623
00:48:02,929 --> 00:48:04,929
And you'd I mean, you'd go fucking 100 miles.

624
00:48:04,929 --> 00:48:07,300
You'd go fast.

625
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:13,250
And then you mean you'd stall out eventually.

626
00:48:13,250 --> 00:48:17,789
That's really bad for the engine.

627
00:48:17,789 --> 00:48:19,789
You're right. I thought Werner.

628
00:48:19,789 --> 00:48:21,789
I'm not saying to do that.

629
00:48:21,789 --> 00:48:23,789
I'm just saying this doesn't make any sense.

630
00:48:23,789 --> 00:48:25,789
He's not even pressing the gas.

631
00:48:25,789 --> 00:48:27,789
Texaco's super unleaded superstar.

632
00:48:27,789 --> 00:48:29,789
Is it implied that he's flooring it?

633
00:48:29,789 --> 00:48:31,789
And his gas is proof.

634
00:48:31,789 --> 00:48:35,250
There's no proof.

635
00:48:35,250 --> 00:48:37,250
Power for more car power.

636
00:48:37,250 --> 00:48:41,250
Hi, Bob doing yourself hope here for Havilland supreme motor oil.

637
00:48:41,250 --> 00:48:45,250
Texaco's formula with its nine additives gives proven engine protection

638
00:48:45,250 --> 00:48:47,250
for air rust and corrosion.

639
00:48:47,250 --> 00:48:51,250
And Havilland's friction fighter reduces engine friction to help save gasoline in your car.

640
00:48:51,250 --> 00:48:53,250
Next time you change oil,

641
00:48:53,250 --> 00:48:57,250
get the motor oil that gives you proven engine protection.

642
00:48:57,250 --> 00:49:02,690
And check this out.

643
00:49:02,690 --> 00:49:05,949
He blows a fireball.

644
00:49:05,949 --> 00:49:07,949
Save gasoline.

645
00:49:07,949 --> 00:49:10,579
Havilland supreme.

646
00:49:10,579 --> 00:49:15,949
What happened to the car?

647
00:49:17,949 --> 00:49:19,949
Stay tuned for more of Bob Hope's Jolly Christmas Hour.

648
00:49:19,949 --> 00:49:21,949
Right after this station break.

649
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:26,320
The NBA team.

650
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:28,320
Who's got the guts to grab Mr. T's gold and chain him to Murdock.

651
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:30,320
By taking downtown Tokyo away from Godzilla.

652
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:32,320
And on Reptide, Murray the powerful.

653
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:34,320
Murray the ruthless.

654
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:36,320
Murray the media star.

655
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:38,320
I think we created a monster.

656
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:42,320
And on Remington Steel, one of these masterful mystery writers has murder in mind for Laura and Steel.

657
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:44,320
What just happened?

658
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:46,320
When a neighborhood starts to die,

659
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:48,320
it seems there's nothing anyone can do to save it.

660
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:50,320
Did she just fly into him?

661
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:52,320
Riding in...

662
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:54,320
A wheelchair?

663
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:56,320
And they explode.

664
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:58,320
Why do they explode?

665
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:02,320
Why?

666
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:06,320
I want the context of what happened.

667
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:08,320
But that's not true.

668
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:10,320
With enough caring, a neighborhood can live.

669
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:12,320
Citibank knows it.

670
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:14,320
And Citibank knows it takes a lot of people

671
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:16,320
and a lot of hard work.

672
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:18,320
For over 15 years, we've helped restore

673
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:20,320
communities throughout the New York area.

674
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:22,320
We provide more money for more housing

675
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:24,320
than any other bank in New York.

676
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:26,320
We have a commitment to this city.

677
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:28,320
After all, it's our city too.

678
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:30,320
It's your Citibank.

679
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:34,500
Metro North. Drills for disaster.

680
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:36,500
Story at 11.

681
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:40,500
Oh, we're back to Bob Hope's.

682
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:42,500
Oh, home of holiday Christmas hour.

683
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:44,670
No, no we're not.

684
00:50:44,670 --> 00:50:46,670
Bob, he's a pro.

685
00:50:46,670 --> 00:50:48,670
I can't beat him.

686
00:50:48,670 --> 00:50:50,670
He's driving on regular unleaded, but you've got

687
00:50:50,670 --> 00:50:52,670
Texaco Super unleaded.

688
00:50:52,670 --> 00:50:54,670
Whoa!

689
00:50:54,670 --> 00:50:56,670
An identical turbo car

690
00:50:56,670 --> 00:50:58,670
and can boost power.

691
00:50:58,670 --> 00:51:01,679
These people are not in a race.

692
00:51:01,679 --> 00:51:04,690
Are they? What is Bob doing here?

693
00:51:09,889 --> 00:51:11,889
It does look like Trump.

694
00:51:17,710 --> 00:51:20,780
Bob, he's a pro.

695
00:51:20,780 --> 00:51:22,780
I can't do it.

696
00:51:22,780 --> 00:51:26,179
I can't do it.

697
00:51:26,179 --> 00:51:30,400
That's Donald Trump right there.

698
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:32,400
That's Donald Trump.

699
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:34,400
Okay.

700
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:36,699
If you said Jerma, I'll give you a million dollars

701
00:51:36,699 --> 00:51:39,010
if you tell me who this person is.

702
00:51:39,010 --> 00:51:41,010
I'll give you a million dollars in cash

703
00:51:41,010 --> 00:51:43,010
and a handful of briefcases.

704
00:51:43,010 --> 00:51:45,179
Who is this guy on camera right now?

705
00:51:45,179 --> 00:51:48,699
That is Donald Trump.

706
00:51:48,699 --> 00:51:54,210
And I would bet my life on it.

707
00:51:56,510 --> 00:51:58,940
I fixed the race.

708
00:51:58,940 --> 00:52:00,940
He's driving on

709
00:52:00,940 --> 00:52:02,940
regular unleaded fuel.

710
00:52:02,940 --> 00:52:05,179
I have super unleaded.

711
00:52:05,179 --> 00:52:07,789
By the way, aliens?

712
00:52:07,789 --> 00:52:09,789
Super cool. They're super funny.

713
00:52:09,789 --> 00:52:12,030
They're super sweet. I learned a lot from them.

714
00:52:12,030 --> 00:52:14,030
Regular unleaded, but you've got Texaco

715
00:52:14,030 --> 00:52:16,030
Super unleaded.

716
00:52:16,030 --> 00:52:18,030
You know what's crazy? All the weird

717
00:52:18,030 --> 00:52:20,030
commercials Donald Trump used to do,

718
00:52:20,030 --> 00:52:22,030
I would not be surprised if

719
00:52:22,030 --> 00:52:24,980
he was here just doing that.

720
00:52:24,980 --> 00:52:26,980
Even against a pro

721
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:28,980
in an identical turbo car,

722
00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:30,980
it can boost power, improving acceleration

723
00:52:30,980 --> 00:52:32,980
up steep roads almost 12 percent.

724
00:52:32,980 --> 00:52:34,980
I won, I won.

725
00:52:34,980 --> 00:52:36,980
When you need more octane superstar power

726
00:52:36,980 --> 00:52:38,980
gives you more car power.

727
00:52:38,980 --> 00:52:40,980
Next time you get the Texaco Super.

728
00:52:40,980 --> 00:52:42,980
Why does he have one of these

729
00:52:42,980 --> 00:52:47,780
in his trunk? This is not a

730
00:52:47,780 --> 00:52:49,780
gas station. This is implied that he carries

731
00:52:49,780 --> 00:52:51,780
this around with him. He just has

732
00:52:51,780 --> 00:52:53,949
a gas pump?

733
00:52:53,949 --> 00:52:56,510
This is not a station.

734
00:52:56,510 --> 00:53:00,739
I won, I won.

735
00:53:00,739 --> 00:53:06,030
And then he goes

736
00:53:06,030 --> 00:53:08,030
blows into the fireball. It's his

737
00:53:08,030 --> 00:53:11,809
thing he does in these.

738
00:53:11,809 --> 00:53:13,809
Behind the new Texaco star.

739
00:53:13,809 --> 00:53:16,500
There's a new Texaco.

740
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:18,739
LaSalle Seiko.

741
00:53:18,739 --> 00:53:20,739
Superb design.

742
00:53:20,739 --> 00:53:22,739
Responding to the challenge of the

743
00:53:22,739 --> 00:53:24,739
highest quartz technology.

744
00:53:24,739 --> 00:53:27,420
LaSalle Seiko.

745
00:53:27,420 --> 00:53:29,420
Thinness at times

746
00:53:29,420 --> 00:53:31,420
almost two dimensional.

747
00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:33,420
Form that reaches for perfection.

748
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:35,420
And now LaSalle Seiko

749
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:37,420
gold in the preeminent 14

750
00:53:37,420 --> 00:53:39,420
karat timepiece of this decade.

751
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:41,599
LaSalle Seiko.

752
00:53:41,599 --> 00:53:43,599
Among the world's great possessions.

753
00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:45,599
I'm not a watch guy.

754
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:48,739
I feel like I'd be super aware of it all the

755
00:53:48,739 --> 00:53:52,449
time. Like it would, it would

756
00:53:52,449 --> 00:53:54,449
you know if I'm wearing a long sleeve it like pops

757
00:53:54,449 --> 00:53:58,800
out and yeah. I don't know. I feel like

758
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:00,800
I'd be so aware of it. Oh yeah that's that.

759
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:03,230
I have that on. And let me

760
00:54:03,230 --> 00:54:07,650
show it to you. I mean I'm not against

761
00:54:07,650 --> 00:54:09,889
you know this is like oh are you against

762
00:54:09,889 --> 00:54:11,889
jewelry or are you against accessories?

763
00:54:11,889 --> 00:54:14,579
No, no not necessarily.

764
00:54:14,579 --> 00:54:16,579
But like you know if you have like a regular watch

765
00:54:16,579 --> 00:54:18,579
it's like oh this thing is a watch it tells time or

766
00:54:18,579 --> 00:54:21,329
something right? But I don't know I feel like I would be

767
00:54:21,329 --> 00:54:23,329
always under pressure to show people

768
00:54:23,329 --> 00:54:25,329
that I'm wearing one of these watches.

769
00:54:25,329 --> 00:54:29,469
If it's on it's almost like

770
00:54:29,469 --> 00:54:31,780
you're wearing it and it's this big

771
00:54:31,780 --> 00:54:33,780
gold beautiful how much does it cost? It's expensive

772
00:54:33,780 --> 00:54:35,780
and it's beautiful and it's class

773
00:54:35,780 --> 00:54:38,719
right? I feel like you don't I don't

774
00:54:38,719 --> 00:54:40,719
know I feel like you would be constantly going

775
00:54:40,719 --> 00:54:48,139
and then the cashier at the grocery

776
00:54:48,139 --> 00:54:52,110
store is just like okay

777
00:54:52,110 --> 00:54:54,110
that'll be um that'll be

778
00:54:54,110 --> 00:54:56,110
$49. You know what I mean?

779
00:54:56,110 --> 00:54:58,110
I feel like I'd be constantly under pressure.

780
00:54:58,110 --> 00:55:00,349
I don't want to be like I don't want to be under pressure.

781
00:55:00,349 --> 00:55:04,900
You eat smoke for 12

782
00:55:04,900 --> 00:55:07,840
hours. What?

783
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:09,840
So hot you feel like you're working inside a

784
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:11,840
furnace. Yeah you get a

785
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:13,840
headache. Oh okay.

786
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:16,210
You want something strong.

787
00:55:16,210 --> 00:55:18,210
Anisyn. Anisyn.

788
00:55:18,210 --> 00:55:20,210
23% more medicine. I thought he was telling

789
00:55:20,210 --> 00:55:22,210
us like this is a crazy fact

790
00:55:22,210 --> 00:55:24,820
that you need to know. What a wild

791
00:55:24,820 --> 00:55:26,820
fact. You like eat smoke

792
00:55:26,820 --> 00:55:28,820
all day. That's what I thought it was. Inside

793
00:55:28,820 --> 00:55:30,820
a furnace.

794
00:55:30,820 --> 00:55:34,530
You eat smoke

795
00:55:34,530 --> 00:55:38,179
for 12 hours. So

796
00:55:38,179 --> 00:55:40,179
hot you feel like you're working inside a furnace.

797
00:55:40,179 --> 00:55:42,179
Yeah you get a headache.

798
00:55:42,179 --> 00:55:44,929
You want something strong.

799
00:55:44,929 --> 00:55:47,420
Anisyn. Anisyn.

800
00:55:47,420 --> 00:55:49,420
23% more medicine

801
00:55:49,420 --> 00:55:51,420
than regular pain relievers. Anisyn's

802
00:55:51,420 --> 00:55:54,050
I thought that was a snickers bar.

803
00:55:54,050 --> 00:56:00,750
stops pain fast.

804
00:56:00,750 --> 00:56:03,059
Headache's gone and no stomach

805
00:56:03,059 --> 00:56:05,619
upset. That really

806
00:56:05,619 --> 00:56:08,300
takes the heat off. Anisyn

807
00:56:08,300 --> 00:56:10,300
more medicine.

808
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:12,300
Take a close look at a new small

809
00:56:12,300 --> 00:56:14,300
car from today.

810
00:56:14,300 --> 00:56:16,300
I'm going to give that commercial an A-.

811
00:56:16,300 --> 00:56:18,739
This is an A- because it was super

812
00:56:18,739 --> 00:56:22,429
to the point. It's just hey

813
00:56:22,429 --> 00:56:24,429
headaches suck. And you know if

814
00:56:24,429 --> 00:56:26,429
I'm working and I got a headache I got something

815
00:56:26,429 --> 00:56:28,929
I need something. This is an A- for me.

816
00:56:28,929 --> 00:56:31,230
Headache's gone and no stomach upset.

817
00:56:31,230 --> 00:56:33,920
That really

818
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:36,219
takes the heat off. Anisyn

819
00:56:36,219 --> 00:56:38,219
more medicine. That's not Bob Hope.

820
00:56:38,219 --> 00:56:40,219
Take a close look at a new

821
00:56:40,219 --> 00:56:42,219
small car. That's not Bob. If it was Bob Hope

822
00:56:42,219 --> 00:56:44,460
he would have been saying

823
00:56:44,460 --> 00:56:46,769
something along the lines of this.

824
00:56:46,769 --> 00:56:48,769
The thing about it is headaches

825
00:56:48,769 --> 00:56:50,940
are really really tough. But you know it's

826
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:52,940
not a headache and he steps out of the way and there's a

827
00:56:52,940 --> 00:56:55,889
Texaco gas pump behind him.

828
00:56:55,889 --> 00:56:59,019
Fill it up with super unleaded. Texaco

829
00:56:59,019 --> 00:57:01,019
gas is cleaner. He would step out of the

830
00:57:01,019 --> 00:57:03,019
way and it would not be a headache commercial anymore.

831
00:57:03,019 --> 00:57:07,250
From today's Chevrolet

832
00:57:07,250 --> 00:57:09,250
new Spectrum.

833
00:57:09,250 --> 00:57:11,250
In Spectrum you discover both sporty performance

834
00:57:11,250 --> 00:57:13,250
and everyday economy. The performance

835
00:57:13,250 --> 00:57:15,250
comes from 5 speed overhead cam

836
00:57:15,250 --> 00:57:17,250
drills that boast a test track time of

837
00:57:17,250 --> 00:57:19,250
0-50 in 8.2 seconds.

838
00:57:19,250 --> 00:57:21,250
Spectrum economy. Uh oh.

839
00:57:21,250 --> 00:57:23,420
The performance comes from

840
00:57:23,420 --> 00:57:25,420
5 speed overhead cam drills

841
00:57:25,420 --> 00:57:28,050
that boast a test track time of

842
00:57:28,050 --> 00:57:30,050
unleaded fuel only.

843
00:57:30,050 --> 00:57:34,400
Not super unleaded

844
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:41,869
fuel. Uh oh.

845
00:57:41,869 --> 00:57:43,869
0-50 in 8.2 seconds.

846
00:57:43,869 --> 00:57:45,869
Spectrum's economy comes from

847
00:57:45,869 --> 00:57:47,869
the highest gas mileage of any sedan in America.

848
00:57:47,869 --> 00:57:49,869
Discover new Spectrum.

849
00:57:49,869 --> 00:57:51,869
The sporty car of our everyday driving.

850
00:57:53,869 --> 00:57:55,869
That's not how it works.

851
00:57:58,500 --> 00:58:14,179
Play a game if you guys want

852
00:58:14,179 --> 00:58:16,179
where we watch the first 5 seconds

853
00:58:16,179 --> 00:58:18,179
and if the product's not there we have to guess what the product

854
00:58:18,179 --> 00:58:20,179
will be. I like that. That's

855
00:58:20,179 --> 00:58:23,630
fun too. Again, that's a lot of candles.

856
00:58:29,630 --> 00:58:31,630
I've seen this one.

857
00:58:31,630 --> 00:58:33,630
May they be the warmest ever.

858
00:58:33,630 --> 00:58:35,630
We'll do that on the next one.

859
00:58:48,579 --> 00:58:50,579
Hold on a second. Let me blind this

860
00:58:50,579 --> 00:58:52,579
pilot for a few seconds.

861
00:59:02,579 --> 00:59:04,579
Wait a minute.

862
00:59:06,579 --> 00:59:08,579
The UFO is coming.

863
00:59:08,579 --> 00:59:10,880
It's right here.

864
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:15,659
He made a pact with the aliens.

865
00:59:15,659 --> 00:59:18,099
Did you see that?

866
00:59:26,190 --> 00:59:28,190
He's signaling to the aliens.

867
00:59:38,190 --> 00:59:40,190
Okay.

868
00:59:45,010 --> 00:59:48,960
If we were playing the game

869
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:50,960
to pause after one second.

870
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:54,960
I would have said it was for cheese.

871
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:56,960
I would have said it was a cheese commercial.

872
00:59:56,960 --> 00:59:59,900
But that's not what this is.

873
00:59:59,900 --> 01:00:01,900
This is...

874
01:00:01,900 --> 01:00:03,900
I was going to go all in

875
01:00:03,900 --> 01:00:05,900
for a cheese commercial.

876
01:00:11,900 --> 01:00:13,900
Or a cough drop, yep.

877
01:00:35,539 --> 01:00:37,539
You bet your ass we're missing out on some

878
01:00:37,539 --> 01:00:40,289
prime quality video

879
01:00:40,289 --> 01:00:42,719
content because

880
01:00:42,719 --> 01:00:44,719
you know for a fact

881
01:00:44,719 --> 01:00:47,019
there's going to be at least a dozen

882
01:00:47,019 --> 01:00:49,019
product tie-ins with Texaco on that special.

883
01:01:04,829 --> 01:01:06,829
Sound of Music is amazing. I mean you're talking about one of the most

884
01:01:06,829 --> 01:01:08,829
classic pieces of media ever

885
01:01:08,829 --> 01:01:10,829
produced.

886
01:01:12,829 --> 01:01:14,829
There's no penis on the wall.

887
01:01:16,829 --> 01:01:18,829
I think that's it for this one.

888
01:01:26,130 --> 01:01:29,389
We're going to move on to the next one.

889
01:01:29,389 --> 01:01:31,389
This was a good one. That was quality.

890
01:01:31,389 --> 01:01:39,519
What is on the wall?

891
01:01:39,519 --> 01:01:42,590
There is currently nothing on the wall.

892
01:01:42,590 --> 01:01:45,219
I promise. I would show it if there was.

893
01:01:45,219 --> 01:01:47,780
Alright, so that's that one. Pretty cool.

894
01:01:47,780 --> 01:01:53,019
That was 80s commercials.

895
01:01:53,019 --> 01:01:55,019
I'm so sorry. I gotta

896
01:01:55,019 --> 01:01:57,019
stop that. I'm trying to make a point

897
01:01:57,019 --> 01:01:59,019
as to what people do to go back

898
01:01:59,019 --> 01:02:01,019
because everyone was like, that joke was bad. But like it wasn't though.

899
01:02:01,019 --> 01:02:03,630
Alright, so

900
01:02:03,630 --> 01:02:06,059
This one

901
01:02:06,059 --> 01:02:11,059
Do I want to do 80s? Okay, let's play

902
01:02:11,059 --> 01:02:14,320
the game. Let's play the game

903
01:02:14,320 --> 01:02:16,940
of

904
01:02:16,940 --> 01:02:18,940
Should I do 2 seconds or 3 seconds?

905
01:02:18,940 --> 01:02:21,630
Do 90s?

906
01:02:21,630 --> 01:02:23,630
I mean, I'll do it. I'm going to do this

907
01:02:23,630 --> 01:02:26,449
a lot. Just the whole time. Do a 90s

908
01:02:26,449 --> 01:02:30,610
one? Alright, let me get a 90s one.

909
01:02:30,610 --> 01:02:36,500
We'll do a 90s one. Alright, 90s.

910
01:02:36,500 --> 01:02:38,860
This is 90s

911
01:02:38,860 --> 01:02:40,860
commercials, volume 410.

912
01:02:40,860 --> 01:02:48,210
Here we go. Oh, we're going to do it.

913
01:02:48,210 --> 01:02:50,210
Right? This one's kind of cheating

914
01:02:50,210 --> 01:02:52,210
because this is when I grew up.

915
01:02:52,210 --> 01:02:54,510
This is when I was younger.

916
01:02:54,510 --> 01:02:56,510
So, I'm going to know a lot of these probably.

917
01:02:56,510 --> 01:02:58,880
We'll see. Let's play it. 2 seconds

918
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:05,730
or 3 seconds? 3? Okay.

919
01:03:05,730 --> 01:03:07,730
Here we go.

920
01:03:07,730 --> 01:03:10,349
What a show.

921
01:03:10,349 --> 01:03:13,420
This program is

922
01:03:13,420 --> 01:03:15,420
brought to you by Barks, the one

923
01:03:15,420 --> 01:03:17,420
with bite. It's going to be Barks Root Beer.

924
01:03:17,420 --> 01:03:19,789
I think we already know that.

925
01:03:19,789 --> 01:03:21,969
I'm going to put

926
01:03:21,969 --> 01:03:23,969
my bet on Barks Root Beer incoming.

927
01:03:23,969 --> 01:03:32,349
Okay? You guys

928
01:03:32,349 --> 01:03:34,909
making your bets here? Barks

929
01:03:34,909 --> 01:03:39,199
Root Beer. Let's see.

930
01:03:47,199 --> 01:03:49,199
What the hell was that? What happened?

931
01:03:49,199 --> 01:03:51,199
Why did they just kick that guy?

932
01:03:59,199 --> 01:04:01,199
Oh, it's temporary tattoos.

933
01:04:03,199 --> 01:04:05,699
Dude, that was such a trope

934
01:04:05,699 --> 01:04:07,699
in the 90s. The old lady

935
01:04:07,699 --> 01:04:10,320
that's sitting there

936
01:04:10,320 --> 01:04:12,320
leaning into the camera saying

937
01:04:12,320 --> 01:04:14,750
no, no, no. Every gum commercial,

938
01:04:14,750 --> 01:04:16,929
every

939
01:04:16,929 --> 01:04:18,929
soda commercial, everything

940
01:04:18,929 --> 01:04:20,929
that was geared towards the younger

941
01:04:20,929 --> 01:04:22,929
audience, grandma was

942
01:04:22,929 --> 01:04:24,929
telling you, you can't

943
01:04:24,929 --> 01:04:27,360
have that. No, this is

944
01:04:27,360 --> 01:04:29,360
for grandma. No, it's not.

945
01:04:29,360 --> 01:04:31,730
No, it's not.

946
01:04:31,730 --> 01:04:33,730
It's for me.

947
01:04:36,539 --> 01:04:38,539
Barks Root Beer, the one with

948
01:04:38,539 --> 01:04:42,960
bark 2s.

949
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:45,579
Okay, this is obviously for a CD player

950
01:04:45,579 --> 01:04:47,579
or a, I got to get it right though.

951
01:04:47,579 --> 01:04:50,269
Was that a tape? This is 90s.

952
01:04:50,269 --> 01:04:52,960
Is that a tape player or a CD player?

953
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:58,380
When in the 90s though?

954
01:04:58,380 --> 01:05:03,179
I'm going to say that's a CD player. I don't know

955
01:05:03,179 --> 01:05:05,179
what company though, but let's see.

956
01:05:05,179 --> 01:05:07,420
It's a CD player.

957
01:05:07,420 --> 01:05:17,920
Okay, I swear

958
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:19,920
this is a real memory. I hope, I don't think

959
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:21,920
I'm making this up, but I feel like I

960
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:24,159
actually did this. These are the CD players

961
01:05:24,159 --> 01:05:27,039
that didn't skip because

962
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:29,039
back in the day

963
01:05:29,039 --> 01:05:31,340
when you had a CD player, it

964
01:05:31,340 --> 01:05:33,340
was feeding you the music

965
01:05:33,340 --> 01:05:35,340
in very real time, almost like a record

966
01:05:35,340 --> 01:05:37,840
player. And if you moved

967
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:39,840
and I'm talking even touched it,

968
01:05:39,840 --> 01:05:42,460
it would go,

969
01:05:42,460 --> 01:05:44,460
and skip, skip, skip, skip, skip in your ears.

970
01:05:44,460 --> 01:05:46,460
You couldn't touch it because it was reading it in real

971
01:05:46,460 --> 01:05:48,460
time. They came out with this

972
01:05:48,460 --> 01:05:50,960
technology where it was no

973
01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:53,329
CD skipping. And what I imagined

974
01:05:53,329 --> 01:05:55,329
it did is it like took

975
01:05:55,329 --> 01:05:57,329
the audio, buffered it, and

976
01:05:57,329 --> 01:05:59,329
then put it up to you, right? Like about

977
01:05:59,329 --> 01:06:02,269
maybe like four or five seconds. And I remember

978
01:06:02,269 --> 01:06:04,269
people, it was such a huge jump

979
01:06:04,269 --> 01:06:06,269
in the music world

980
01:06:06,269 --> 01:06:08,269
that I remember people would take those and be

981
01:06:08,269 --> 01:06:10,269
like, hey yeah, look at this.

982
01:06:10,269 --> 01:06:12,900
See? Put your, put the headphones

983
01:06:12,900 --> 01:06:14,900
in, see you, you're not skipping, right?

984
01:06:14,900 --> 01:06:16,900
Not skipping, and like they'd break

985
01:06:16,900 --> 01:06:18,900
them because they were trying to prove a point. And I

986
01:06:18,900 --> 01:06:20,900
feel like I did that to one of, one that I had.

987
01:06:20,900 --> 01:06:24,159
Like I had this weird memory

988
01:06:24,159 --> 01:06:26,159
of me doing that, being like, look, see?

989
01:06:26,159 --> 01:06:28,159
Smack! Smack! And it not

990
01:06:28,159 --> 01:06:30,159
skipping, and then the thing kind of sounded

991
01:06:30,159 --> 01:06:32,159
like shit for the next like ten times I used

992
01:06:32,159 --> 01:06:35,619
it, and I stopped using it. So so many people

993
01:06:35,619 --> 01:06:37,619
were so obsessed with proving to

994
01:06:37,619 --> 01:06:39,619
you that it would work

995
01:06:39,619 --> 01:06:44,099
that they made it not work. Anyway, they had

996
01:06:44,099 --> 01:06:46,780
little bars on them, and it was

997
01:06:46,780 --> 01:06:48,780
loading, it was like a little loading bar.

998
01:06:48,780 --> 01:06:50,780
It was like one, two, three, four, five. If you had

999
01:06:50,780 --> 01:06:52,780
five bars of juice,

1000
01:06:52,780 --> 01:06:56,289
it was like you could, why are you saying F?

1001
01:06:56,289 --> 01:07:02,929
What happened? Well stop

1002
01:07:02,929 --> 01:07:04,929
hitting my screen, stop hitting my stream!

1003
01:07:04,929 --> 01:07:10,179
You gotta stop bumping the stream!

1004
01:07:10,179 --> 01:07:12,179
What the fuck are you doing? Relax, sit in your

1005
01:07:12,179 --> 01:07:14,179
chair normally, like

1006
01:07:14,179 --> 01:07:18,019
this, don't move! Oh, isn't Twitch

1007
01:07:18,019 --> 01:07:20,380
having a bunch of problems? Like

1008
01:07:20,380 --> 01:07:22,380
yeah, my, I got no drop

1009
01:07:22,380 --> 01:07:25,969
frames. Right when I start talking about

1010
01:07:25,969 --> 01:07:27,969
this, that's so stupid. Well, Twitch is having

1011
01:07:27,969 --> 01:07:29,969
problems, whatever, it's all good. I've heard about that.

1012
01:07:29,969 --> 01:07:32,699
Alright, let's keep going. Are we good?

1013
01:07:32,699 --> 01:07:34,699
Everybody good for me? Everybody, is it good

1014
01:07:34,699 --> 01:07:37,260
everybody good for me? Like everyone's like

1015
01:07:37,260 --> 01:07:39,260
waiting for me? Are you good for me to

1016
01:07:39,260 --> 01:07:45,920
begin? Are you good for me to start?

1017
01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:53,980
Does it skip? There it was,

1018
01:07:53,980 --> 01:07:58,530
see the bars? Nothing unleashes

1019
01:07:58,530 --> 01:08:02,559
it. Get out of

1020
01:08:02,559 --> 01:08:04,559
the phone? Get out of the phone?

1021
01:08:06,559 --> 01:08:09,699
Wait, hold on.

1022
01:08:09,699 --> 01:08:12,000
I gotta start this again.

1023
01:08:28,449 --> 01:08:30,449
Who is selling

1024
01:08:30,449 --> 01:08:32,449
the car to who?

1025
01:08:47,630 --> 01:08:49,630
It was

1026
01:08:49,630 --> 01:08:51,630
alright, whatever, neither.

1027
01:08:51,630 --> 01:09:01,630
Hold on.

1028
01:09:01,630 --> 01:09:04,829
He's doing,

1029
01:09:04,829 --> 01:09:06,829
Arnold is doing the thing,

1030
01:09:06,829 --> 01:09:09,579
the YouTuber thing,

1031
01:09:09,579 --> 01:09:11,579
where he goes to switch

1032
01:09:11,579 --> 01:09:13,579
the camera off to cut,

1033
01:09:13,579 --> 01:09:18,319
to do a different take. Watch

1034
01:09:18,319 --> 01:09:20,319
him.

1035
01:09:20,319 --> 01:09:22,319
What do you think of anyone who doesn't see this movie?

1036
01:09:22,319 --> 01:09:27,180
Big mistake.

1037
01:09:27,180 --> 01:09:29,180
But it's old. But look

1038
01:09:29,180 --> 01:09:31,180
at what he's doing. It's like he's saying

1039
01:09:31,180 --> 01:09:33,180
his line and then he's like, oh, let me have that one

1040
01:09:33,180 --> 01:09:35,180
turned out. Let me try it again. Think of anyone who

1041
01:09:35,180 --> 01:09:37,180
doesn't see this movie. Big mistake.

1042
01:09:39,619 --> 01:09:42,180
Everybody knows when you do that though. That's why you

1043
01:09:42,180 --> 01:09:44,180
gotta do it in post. There's no way

1044
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:46,670
to like go, nope, you

1045
01:09:46,670 --> 01:09:49,739
can't move. Different people will know.

1046
01:09:54,210 --> 01:09:56,210
I think it's the biggest movie of the

1047
01:09:56,210 --> 01:09:58,210
summer.

1048
01:09:58,210 --> 01:10:01,340
Burger King and order a flame broiled whopper with

1049
01:10:01,340 --> 01:10:03,340
large fries and a medium drink. You get this last

1050
01:10:03,340 --> 01:10:05,340
action hero. Whoa, that's actually

1051
01:10:05,340 --> 01:10:07,340
sick. Like him, you can be large

1052
01:10:07,340 --> 01:10:09,340
and in charge. So see the movie and

1053
01:10:09,340 --> 01:10:11,340
collect all four cups. It's your way right

1054
01:10:11,340 --> 01:10:13,340
away. I love this place and I'm

1055
01:10:13,340 --> 01:10:15,340
going to see the movie.

1056
01:10:15,340 --> 01:10:19,060
Have you ever opened doors?

1057
01:10:19,060 --> 01:10:21,060
With the sound of your

1058
01:10:21,060 --> 01:10:25,090
voice. Carried your medical

1059
01:10:25,090 --> 01:10:27,090
history in your wallet.

1060
01:10:27,090 --> 01:10:29,090
Your wife's gonna be just fine.

1061
01:10:29,090 --> 01:10:34,260
So this is where we

1062
01:10:34,260 --> 01:10:36,260
attended a meeting.

1063
01:10:36,260 --> 01:10:39,710
Your bare feet.

1064
01:10:39,710 --> 01:10:43,680
Company that'll bring it to you.

1065
01:10:43,680 --> 01:10:45,680
AT&T. Wait.

1066
01:10:45,680 --> 01:10:47,680
Did the internet exist?

1067
01:10:47,680 --> 01:10:53,439
It'll bring it to you.

1068
01:10:53,439 --> 01:10:55,680
When in the 90s is this?

1069
01:10:55,680 --> 01:10:57,680
How early in the 90s?

1070
01:10:57,680 --> 01:10:59,680
This is showing very, very detailed

1071
01:10:59,680 --> 01:11:02,300
video conferencing. You couldn't

1072
01:11:02,300 --> 01:11:04,300
do that.

1073
01:11:04,300 --> 01:11:07,500
Look at this.

1074
01:11:07,500 --> 01:11:11,260
This is

1075
01:11:11,260 --> 01:11:13,260
a detailed video broadcasting

1076
01:11:13,260 --> 01:11:16,909
software. I don't think you could do

1077
01:11:16,909 --> 01:11:21,840
this.

1078
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:26,399
Also, there's no way anyone could hear what he's saying.

1079
01:11:26,399 --> 01:11:28,399
He's just going off and just talking to himself.

1080
01:11:28,399 --> 01:11:31,340
Hold on. By the way, I've got

1081
01:11:31,340 --> 01:11:33,340
a few other ideas. Let me go over here and talk out

1082
01:11:33,340 --> 01:11:35,340
the window so nobody hears

1083
01:11:35,340 --> 01:11:39,119
what I'm saying.

1084
01:11:42,829 --> 01:11:45,329
He just skipped that guy.

1085
01:11:45,329 --> 01:11:52,220
He's calling it like

1086
01:11:52,220 --> 01:11:55,100
Omegle. He just skipped

1087
01:11:55,100 --> 01:11:57,659
him.

1088
01:11:57,659 --> 01:11:59,659
Your bare feet.

01:11:59,659 --> 01:12:03,569

In this quiet neighborhood, there lives

1092
01:12:09,649 --> 01:12:11,649
a menace named Dennis.

1093
01:12:11,649 --> 01:12:13,649
Feels warm.

1094
01:12:13,649 --> 01:12:15,649
You need an ashtray.

1095
01:12:15,649 --> 01:12:17,649
This summer, watch out

1096
01:12:17,649 --> 01:12:19,649
for the kid who's causing all the

1097
01:12:19,649 --> 01:12:22,079
excitement.

1098
01:12:22,079 --> 01:12:24,079
What the fuck?

1099
01:12:24,079 --> 01:12:26,079
What?

1100
01:12:26,079 --> 01:12:28,079

I remember Dennis the Menace.

1104
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:38,800
He was actively trying to kill

1105
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:43,659
Mr. Wilson?

1106
01:12:43,659 --> 01:12:50,579
What?

1107
01:12:50,579 --> 01:12:52,579

This summer.

1112
01:13:00,579 --> 01:13:02,579
But he's

1113
01:13:02,579 --> 01:13:04,579
he sees him do that.

1114
01:13:04,579 --> 01:13:06,819
This summer.

1115
01:13:06,819 --> 01:13:08,819
Like, hey, what are you doing with my aspirin?

1116
01:13:08,819 --> 01:13:10,819
Watch out for the kid

1117
01:13:10,819 --> 01:13:12,819
who's causing all the excitement.

1118
01:13:12,819 --> 01:13:14,819
What is happening?

1119
01:13:14,819 --> 01:13:23,550
What's

1120
01:13:23,550 --> 01:13:26,300

You can take these.

1134
01:13:58,060 --> 01:14:00,060
You could

1135
01:14:00,060 --> 01:14:02,060
take at least three or four of these

1136
01:14:02,060 --> 01:14:04,060
and they would be for different subjects.

1137
01:14:04,060 --> 01:14:06,430
Like, oh, he's talking about something

1138
01:14:06,430 --> 01:14:08,430
really like weird here in this

1139
01:14:08,430 --> 01:14:10,430

01:14:10,430 --> 01:14:12,430
got flaming, like

1141
01:14:12,430 --> 01:14:14,430

Exerlopers give you a more intense

1163
01:15:11,329 --> 01:15:13,329
workout than ordinary jogs with

1164
01:15:13,329 --> 01:15:15,329
extraordinary fun. Because unlike

1165
01:15:15,329 --> 01:15:17,329
running or jogging, Exerlopers patented

1166
01:15:17,329 --> 01:15:19,329
carbonite spring soles take the

1167
01:15:19,329 --> 01:15:21,329
shock out so your muscles do the work.

1168
01:15:21,329 --> 01:15:23,329
Not your joints. You'll jump

1169
01:15:23,329 --> 01:15:25,329
higher, jump faster, jump

1170
01:15:25,329 --> 01:15:27,329
safer. So put some fun in your run

1171
01:15:27,329 --> 01:15:29,329
with the all new Exerlopers. Because

1172
01:15:29,329 --> 01:15:31,329
for about the same price you'd pay to be

1173
01:15:31,329 --> 01:15:33,329
rolling on the ground, you could be jumping through

1174
01:15:33,329 --> 01:15:35,819
the air. Call our to- Okay, you know what it's

1175
01:15:35,819 --> 01:15:37,819
like to walk around with ice skates

1176
01:15:37,819 --> 01:15:42,289
on? They made that

1177
01:15:42,289 --> 01:15:50,079
feeling and encouraged it.

1178
01:15:50,079 --> 01:15:52,079
I feel like you stepped the wrong way

1179
01:15:52,079 --> 01:15:54,699
on one of these. You are

1180
01:15:54,699 --> 01:16:00,659
snapping your ankle. If they were

1181
01:16:00,659 --> 01:16:02,659
wider, maybe. I don't know.

1182
01:16:02,659 --> 01:16:05,659
They kind of look cool though.

1183
01:16:05,659 --> 01:16:07,659
I feel like I'd want to

1184
01:16:07,659 --> 01:16:11,420
They're kind of cool. I would just

1185
01:16:11,420 --> 01:16:13,420
run around and just bounce around

1186
01:16:13,420 --> 01:16:19,310
with them. I wouldn't use them to run.

1187
01:16:19,310 --> 01:16:22,579
These are too expensive?

1188
01:16:22,579 --> 01:16:25,140
Whoa! I thought it

1189
01:16:25,140 --> 01:16:27,140
was forty bucks. It's four

1190
01:16:27,140 --> 01:16:29,140
forty bucks. Four A-12s.

1191
01:16:29,140 --> 01:16:31,140
This is a hundred and sixty bucks.

1192
01:16:31,140 --> 01:16:36,880
I thought they were forty dollars.

1193
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:38,880
A hundred and sixty bucks back in like the early

1194
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:45,260
nineties. That's like

1195
01:16:45,260 --> 01:16:47,260
at least two

1196
01:16:47,260 --> 01:16:49,260
three hundred bucks at this point. Three four hundred?

1197
01:16:49,260 --> 01:16:54,560
Three hundred? Four hundred?

1198
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:56,989
More than that? Like three fifty? Jesus.

1199
01:16:56,989 --> 01:16:59,489
I hope they worked.

1200
01:16:59,489 --> 01:17:01,489
Cool name.

1201
01:17:06,180 --> 01:17:10,590
You gotta show somebody Duncan.

1202
01:17:10,590 --> 01:17:12,770
Show somebody-

1203
01:17:18,770 --> 01:17:21,390
This was a good take, but it's very clear

1204
01:17:21,390 --> 01:17:23,390
that he has lost control when he lands.

1205
01:17:23,390 --> 01:17:25,760
And he's running into the people

1206
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:27,760
that are also extras or in the

1207
01:17:27,760 --> 01:17:31,729
commercial.

1208
01:17:31,729 --> 01:17:33,970
He gets air here.

1209
01:17:35,970 --> 01:17:38,850
He's kind of like, oh shit

1210
01:17:38,850 --> 01:17:42,239
you're right here man.

1211
01:17:42,239 --> 01:17:44,239
They already showed somebody Duncan? No they didn't.

1212
01:17:44,239 --> 01:17:47,819
Jump and condition your body.

versus red shirts. Okay, here we go.

1233
01:18:30,210 --> 01:18:32,210
If you wear those, it's just like a pick up basketball

1234
01:18:32,210 --> 01:18:34,210
game. Are you gonna get, are they gonna allow

1235
01:18:34,210 --> 01:18:39,069
you to wear those? Is it like, hey

1236
01:18:39,069 --> 01:18:42,659
bro, you gotta take those off. They're my shoes.

1237
01:18:42,659 --> 01:18:45,069
I didn't bring any other shoes.

1238

These are the only things I have. You didn't bring any

1239
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:51,520
other shoes? No.

1240
01:18:51,520 --> 01:18:53,520
Well, I guess we're gonna have to let you play.

1241
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:56,720
Break them off? No, break them off.

1242
01:18:56,720 --> 01:19:00,239
These were $350

1243
01:19:00,239 --> 01:19:02,239
USD, 2023

1244
01:19:02,239 --> 01:19:07,039
upscaling. The, I actually

1245
01:19:07,039 --> 01:19:10,239
think, I wanna try these.

1246
01:19:10,239 --> 01:19:12,239
They actually kinda look like they would be fun.

1247
01:19:12,239 --> 01:19:14,800
Right away.

1248
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:17,489
And with our 30 day trial period, you've got

1249
01:19:17,489 --> 01:19:23,060
nothing to lose.

1250
01:19:23,060 --> 01:19:25,060
Maybe not. I don't know.

1251
01:19:25,060 --> 01:19:27,060
You won't believe how it feels

1252
01:19:27,060 --> 01:19:29,060
to be Exerloping. Order now

1253
01:19:29,060 --> 01:19:31,060
and we'll include our electronic pedometer

1254
01:19:31,060 --> 01:19:33,060
absolutely free. They should have shown

1255
01:19:33,060 --> 01:19:35,060
somebody like him landing

1256
01:19:35,060 --> 01:19:37,060
that and then doing

1257
01:19:37,060 --> 01:19:39,060
ten back handsprings

1258
01:19:39,060 --> 01:19:42,000
right after it. Just one, two,

1259
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
three, four, five,

1260
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
six and then fade into this. That would have been

1261
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:50,800
so much cooler. 1995

1262
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:52,800
value. Order now.

1263
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:54,800
You're in comedy

1264
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:59,859
When you're thirsty, you need

1265
01:19:59,859 --> 01:20:01,859
a diet squirt. What the fuck was that? What's going on?

1266
01:20:04,609 --> 01:20:06,609
Because there's nothing like our refreshing

1267
01:20:06,609 --> 01:20:08,609
blend of citrus flavors.

1268
01:20:08,609 --> 01:20:10,609
Give your thirst

1269
01:20:10,609 --> 01:20:14,449
a diet squirt.

1270
01:20:14,449 --> 01:20:16,449
Alright, that was kinda, that was cool.

1271
01:20:16,449 --> 01:20:22,510
That was like, whatever.

1272
01:20:22,510 --> 01:20:25,949
I mean, it was, like all the

1273
01:20:25,949 --> 01:20:29,149
fountain is there and it's like

1274
01:20:29,149 --> 01:20:33,060
When you're thirsty,

1275
01:20:33,060 --> 01:20:35,060
you need a diet squirt.

1276
01:20:35,060 --> 01:20:37,060
It's horrible. Okay, hold on. Diet squirt.

1277
01:20:37,060 --> 01:20:39,869
Give your

1278
01:20:39,869 --> 01:20:41,869
thirst a diet squirt.

1279
01:20:41,869 --> 01:20:44,239
You are on the air.

1280
01:20:44,239 --> 01:20:46,239
You called the radio station? Sam Baldwin

1281
01:20:46,239 --> 01:20:48,239
isn't looking for anyone special.

1282
01:20:48,239 --> 01:20:50,239
Some kid calls a phone in radio show and

1283
01:20:50,239 --> 01:20:52,239
says that his dad needs a new wife.

1284
01:20:52,239 --> 01:20:54,239
And now 2,000 women want his number.

1285
01:20:54,239 --> 01:20:56,239
But someone special. What if this man is my destiny

1286
01:20:56,239 --> 01:20:58,239
and I never meet him? He's looking for him.

1287
01:20:58,239 --> 01:21:00,239
Didn't you see Fatal Attraction?

1288
01:21:00,239 --> 01:21:02,989
You wouldn't let me. Tom Hanks.

1289
01:21:02,989 --> 01:21:04,989
This is really fun. Meg Ryan.

1290
01:21:04,989 --> 01:21:06,989
Is this crazy? Sleepless in Seattle.

1291
01:21:06,989 --> 01:21:08,989
Think Cary Grant. Rated PG.

1292
01:21:08,989 --> 01:21:11,359
I'd like to play you something that I

1293
01:21:11,359 --> 01:21:13,359
recorded literally yesterday.

1294
01:21:13,359 --> 01:21:18,140
Those of you that have, this is

1295
01:21:18,140 --> 01:21:20,319
a great, great segue. So those of you that have been

1296
01:21:20,319 --> 01:21:22,319
on the channel for a long time, you know

1297
01:21:22,319 --> 01:21:25,069
that whenever

1298
01:21:25,069 --> 01:21:27,500
I get a lot of food in my throat, I get

1299
01:21:27,500 --> 01:21:30,260
the Tom Hanks voice. And let me tell you

1300
01:21:30,260 --> 01:21:33,460
what I recorded is

1301
01:21:33,460 --> 01:21:36,529
unbelievable. I caught

1302
01:21:36,529 --> 01:21:39,329
it super perfectly.

1303
01:21:39,329 --> 01:21:44,829
Super good. So the Tom Hanks

1304
01:21:44,829 --> 01:21:46,829
voice thing I'm talking about, yeah.

1305
01:21:46,829 --> 01:21:48,829
If you eat and you get food kind of stuck a little bit there,

1306
01:21:48,829 --> 01:21:50,829
like milk voice a little bit, for some reason

1307
01:21:50,829 --> 01:21:53,579
it makes me sound just like him.

1308
01:21:53,579 --> 01:21:55,579
So I recorded this. This was literally last night.

1309
01:21:55,579 --> 01:22:01,010
Then I won't sound like Tom Hanks anymore.

1310
01:22:01,010 --> 01:22:03,180
And when you get, when you finally get the

1311
01:22:03,180 --> 01:22:05,180
Tom Hanks voice, that's when you really

1312
01:22:05,180 --> 01:22:07,180
can shine as an actor.

1313
01:22:07,180 --> 01:22:09,180
And be a part of, I was in Forrest Gump

1314
01:22:09,180 --> 01:22:11,180
and I was

1315
01:22:11,180 --> 01:22:13,359
you know, I was Woody in Toy Story

1316
01:22:13,359 --> 01:22:15,359
remember? It's me, Woody,

1317
01:22:15,359 --> 01:22:17,359
and you buzz are gonna get us

1318
01:22:17,359 --> 01:22:21,069
in trouble with Andy. It's gone.

1319
01:22:21,069 --> 01:22:32,260
Fuck. There you go.

1320
01:22:32,260 --> 01:22:36,739
That lasted a very long time.

1321
01:22:36,739 --> 01:22:44,859
That lasted so long.

1322
01:22:44,859 --> 01:22:48,319
Holly said to me last night,

1323
01:22:48,319 --> 01:22:50,819
she's like, Dad, that was really good, but

1324
01:22:50,819 --> 01:22:53,890
what are you talking about? Buzz, you're

1325
01:22:53,890 --> 01:22:55,890
gonna get us in trouble with Andy.

1326
01:22:55,890 --> 01:22:59,279
Was, yeah, they don't

1327
01:22:59,279 --> 01:23:01,899
Andy's not like their

1328
01:23:01,899 --> 01:23:03,899
like dad. Andy doesn't even know

1329
01:23:03,899 --> 01:23:08,579
they exist. It was just filler,

1330
01:23:08,579 --> 01:23:10,579
filler, filler. I had to get it quick. It was

1331
01:23:10,579 --> 01:23:12,579
quick, quick, quick. I gotta get it quick, quick, quick, quick, quick.

1332
01:23:12,579 --> 01:23:15,710
Although that's the point though.

1333
01:23:15,710 --> 01:23:21,779
I couldn't do that right

1334
01:23:21,779 --> 01:23:23,779
now if I tried. No, you

1335
01:23:23,779 --> 01:23:26,720
can't. He's got a very distinct voice.

1336
01:23:26,720 --> 01:23:33,310
Special sneak preview Saturday night.

1337
01:23:33,310 --> 01:23:35,310
You're 37, supposedly.

1338
01:24:03,550 --> 01:24:05,550
And scandal.

1339
01:24:07,550 --> 01:24:09,550
Who is this lady supposed to be?

1340
01:24:09,550 --> 01:24:13,390
You know, all those things,

1341
01:24:13,390 --> 01:24:15,390
all those things that you hear about the Kennedys

1342
01:24:15,390 --> 01:24:17,569
eyes in it.

1343
01:24:17,569 --> 01:24:20,579
It was me.

1344
01:24:20,579 --> 01:24:22,579
But they don't explain who that lady is?

1345
01:24:22,579 --> 01:24:24,579
I am the person

1346
01:24:24,579 --> 01:24:26,579
who started the rumors about the Kennedys

1347
01:24:26,579 --> 01:24:28,579
and Marilyn Monroe.

1348
01:24:28,579 --> 01:24:30,579
It was me.

1349
01:24:30,579 --> 01:24:36,829
It's so

1350
01:24:36,829 --> 01:24:45,390
stupid.

1351
01:24:45,390 --> 01:24:47,390
Why is she evil?

1352
01:24:47,390 --> 01:24:50,590
VH1's new show that makes

1353
01:24:50,590 --> 01:24:52,590
Gotham a king where no

1354
01:24:52,590 --> 01:24:54,590
star is sacred. The men share

1355
01:24:54,590 --> 01:24:56,590
married, dated, or had sex with.

1356
01:24:56,590 --> 01:24:58,590
And scandal scores.

1357
01:24:58,590 --> 01:25:00,590
Watch Rumor Has It every Monday

1358
01:25:00,590 --> 01:25:02,590
through Thursday at 7 and 11

1359
01:25:02,590 --> 01:25:04,590
Eastern on VH1.

1360
01:25:04,590 --> 01:25:06,590
Jack, Bobby, Norma Jean,

1361
01:25:06,590 --> 01:25:09,579
I'm so sorry.

1362
01:25:20,020 --> 01:25:22,579
The first part and the end part

1363
01:25:22,579 --> 01:25:24,579
of that commercial don't

1364
01:25:24,579 --> 01:25:29,119
need to be there.

1365
01:25:29,119 --> 01:25:31,119
I guess it's funny.

1366
01:25:31,119 --> 01:25:33,119
Is it funny?

1367
01:25:33,119 --> 01:25:35,619
They could have just done the commercial

1368
01:25:35,619 --> 01:25:37,619
of the show, but they had to have

1369
01:25:37,619 --> 01:25:40,239
this old lady.

1370
01:25:40,239 --> 01:25:42,239
It was me. I spread those rumors.

1371
01:25:42,239 --> 01:25:44,239
I'm so sorry for what I've done.

1372
01:25:46,239 --> 01:25:48,239
The controversial new series

1373
01:25:48,239 --> 01:25:50,239
from Time Life Books had a few choice

1374
01:25:50,239 --> 01:25:52,239
words to share with us.

1375
01:25:52,239 --> 01:25:59,090
It was clear

1376
01:25:59,090 --> 01:26:05,039
that true crime digs deeper than

1377
01:26:07,039 --> 01:26:09,039
Somebody just dropped

1378
01:26:09,039 --> 01:26:11,340
like a big steel pot

1379
01:26:11,340 --> 01:26:14,100
down a flight of stairs with us.

1380
01:26:14,100 --> 01:26:16,100
It's just a long

1381
01:26:16,100 --> 01:26:18,100
hotel stairwell or something.

1382
01:26:18,100 --> 01:26:20,100
People who've read true crime,

1383
01:26:20,100 --> 01:26:22,100

to share with us.

Watch out, watch out.

1387
01:26:32,109 --> 01:26:34,109
I'm making a video.

1388
01:26:34,109 --> 01:26:36,109
True crime digs deeper than the headline news.

Some kind of device. We have a possible

situation.

1414
01:27:35,739 --> 01:27:37,739
Not a situation.

1415
01:27:37,739 --> 01:27:39,739
Don't touch the button. Quiet please.

1416
01:27:39,739 --> 01:27:41,739
It's just a car

1417
01:27:41,739 --> 01:27:43,739
stereo. Pioneer car

1418
01:27:43,739 --> 01:27:45,739
stereos offer you a detachable face

1419
01:27:45,739 --> 01:27:51,890
for the... Why do you have a car

1420
01:27:51,890 --> 01:27:55,090
stereo in your pocket? Isn't that

1421
01:27:55,090 --> 01:27:57,090
the ultimate insecurity?

1422
01:27:57,090 --> 01:27:59,090
You see it's a detachable face for the

1423
01:27:59,090 --> 01:28:02,350
car stereo.

1424
01:28:02,350 --> 01:28:04,350
Why would you bring it through

1425
01:28:04,350 --> 01:28:06,350
the...

1426
01:28:08,350 --> 01:28:10,350
Open your code please. Take that thing out

1427
01:28:10,350 --> 01:28:12,350
slowly

1428
01:28:12,350 --> 01:28:14,899
and open it.

1429
01:28:14,899 --> 01:28:16,899
Some kind of device. We have a possible situation.

1430
01:28:16,899 --> 01:28:18,899
We've got some kind of device.

1431
01:28:23,569 --> 01:28:25,569
It's the JFK

1432
01:28:25,569 --> 01:28:28,130
lady?

1433
01:28:28,130 --> 01:28:32,590
No it's not.

1434
01:28:32,590 --> 01:28:34,590
7-11 Eastern on VH1

1435
01:28:34,590 --> 01:28:36,590
Jack, Bobby,

1436
01:28:36,590 --> 01:28:38,960
Norma Jean, I'm so

1437
01:28:38,960 --> 01:28:40,960
sorry.

1438
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:42,960
No it's not.

1439
01:28:42,960 --> 01:28:45,779
It's not.

1440
01:28:45,779 --> 01:28:48,529
It's just

1441
01:28:48,529 --> 01:28:50,899
an old lady.

1442
01:28:50,899 --> 01:28:52,899
It's just an old lady.

1443
01:28:52,899 --> 01:28:54,899
Don't touch the button. Quiet please.

1444
01:28:54,899 --> 01:28:57,199
It's just a car stereo.

1445
01:28:57,199 --> 01:28:59,199
Wait, he's touching the buttons?

1446
01:28:59,199 --> 01:29:01,199
Don't touch the button. Dude, don't

1447
01:29:01,199 --> 01:29:03,199
do that. Like come on.

1448
01:29:03,199 --> 01:29:06,779
If you go through... You're going through security

1449
01:29:06,779 --> 01:29:09,279
and it's like

1450
01:29:09,279 --> 01:29:11,279
dee dee dee... Hold on a second there.

1451
01:29:11,279 --> 01:29:13,649
What's in your pocket there sir?

1452
01:29:13,649 --> 01:29:15,649
Oh well you see. We've got a device

1453
01:29:15,649 --> 01:29:19,340
and you start going... What?

1454
01:29:19,340 --> 01:29:21,340
No it's not.

1455
01:29:21,340 --> 01:29:23,340
Not a situation.

1456
01:29:23,340 --> 01:29:26,220
Don't touch the button. Quiet please.

1457
01:29:26,220 --> 01:29:29,100
He wasn't doing that.

1458
01:29:29,100 --> 01:29:31,100
Yes ma'am.

1459
01:29:31,100 --> 01:29:33,470
Not a situation.

1460
01:29:33,470 --> 01:29:35,470
That's his finger right here. This is somebody else's hand.

1461
01:29:35,470 --> 01:29:40,210
That's somebody else's hand touching

1462
01:29:40,210 --> 01:29:44,819
the buttons. The old lady sounds like

1463
01:29:44,819 --> 01:29:47,060
Lois.

1464
01:29:47,060 --> 01:29:49,060
Quiet please. It's just a car

1465
01:29:49,060 --> 01:29:51,060
stereo.

1466
01:29:51,060 --> 01:29:53,060
We've got some kind of device.

1467
01:29:53,060 --> 01:29:55,060
We've got some kind of device.

1468
01:29:55,060 --> 01:29:57,060
Not a situation.

1469
01:29:57,060 --> 01:29:59,060
Quiet please.

1470
01:29:59,060 --> 01:30:01,060
It's just a car stereo.

1471
01:30:01,060 --> 01:30:03,060
Pioneer car stereo.

1472
01:30:03,060 --> 01:30:05,810
It's all for you Adi.

1473
01:30:05,810 --> 01:30:07,979
I know we've been on this one for a little while

1474
01:30:07,979 --> 01:30:09,979
but this is the type of reaction that characters

1475
01:30:09,979 --> 01:30:12,479
in Hitman have to you.

1476
01:30:12,479 --> 01:30:14,479
This is like AI. Like you walked over

1477
01:30:14,479 --> 01:30:16,479
to an AI and all of a sudden it's like

1478
01:30:16,479 --> 01:30:18,479
they're going through their few routines

1479
01:30:18,479 --> 01:30:20,979
that they have.

1480
01:30:20,979 --> 01:30:22,979
Like this guy

1481
01:30:22,979 --> 01:30:24,979
just kind of bumped into

1482
01:30:24,979 --> 01:30:27,979
that guy. And this whole thing

1483
01:30:27,979 --> 01:30:30,609
unfolded. He got like a little

1484
01:30:30,609 --> 01:30:32,609
GTA. He got a little too close.

1485
01:30:32,609 --> 01:30:34,609
Or the AI just all of a sudden now

1486
01:30:34,609 --> 01:30:36,609
there's something that needs to be taken care of now.

1487
01:30:36,609 --> 01:30:38,850
Yes ma'am. Not a situation.

1488
01:30:38,850 --> 01:30:40,850
Don't touch the buttons. Quiet please.

1489
01:30:40,850 --> 01:30:42,850
It's just a car

1490
01:30:42,850 --> 01:30:44,850
stereo.

1491
01:30:44,850 --> 01:30:46,850
Pioneer car stereos offer you a detachable

1492
01:30:46,850 --> 01:30:48,850
face for the ultimate in security.

1493
01:30:48,850 --> 01:30:50,850
You see it's a detachable

1494
01:30:50,850 --> 01:30:52,850
face for the car stereo.

1495
01:30:52,850 --> 01:30:54,850
I have no idea what you just said.

1496
01:30:54,850 --> 01:30:56,850
Hey, you know what it takes to get

1497
01:30:56,850 --> 01:30:58,850
ahead. Performance.

1498
01:30:58,850 --> 01:31:02,880
You know what it takes to stay

1499
01:31:02,880 --> 01:31:04,880
on track. Control.

1500
01:31:04,880 --> 01:31:08,270
You know what it takes

1501
01:31:08,270 --> 01:31:10,270
to lead the way.

1502
01:31:10,270 --> 01:31:12,270
So do we. The Grand Am

1503
01:31:12,270 --> 01:31:14,270
Sport Coupe. V6

1504
01:31:14,270 --> 01:31:16,270
Performance. The control

1505
01:31:16,270 --> 01:31:18,270
of anti-lock brakes.

1506
01:31:18,270 --> 01:31:23,069
Excitement.

1507
01:31:23,069 --> 01:31:27,100
The only reason you would have a drive like this

1508
01:31:27,100 --> 01:31:29,100
in these commercials is if you thought you were going to shit

1509
01:31:29,100 --> 01:31:31,100
your pants and you had to make it to a bathroom

1510
01:31:31,100 --> 01:31:46,529
as soon as possible. They saw

1511
01:31:46,529 --> 01:31:48,529
you flying around these little roads.

1512
01:31:48,529 --> 01:32:02,319
Look at that

1513
01:32:02,319 --> 01:32:09,420
back. Toastitos restaurant

1514
01:32:09,420 --> 01:32:12,689
style tortilla chips.

1515
01:32:12,689 --> 01:32:14,689
You've never had it this good.

1516
01:32:14,689 --> 01:32:16,689
It's too tall.

1517
01:32:16,689 --> 01:32:18,689
This is the taste

1518
01:32:18,689 --> 01:32:23,100
that takes you there.

1519
01:32:23,100 --> 01:32:25,789
It's cool that they did

1520
01:32:25,789 --> 01:32:27,789
this commercial, but you know I don't appreciate the

1521
01:32:27,789 --> 01:32:31,380
multi-boxing.

1522
01:32:31,380 --> 01:32:34,510
This is the

1523
01:32:34,510 --> 01:32:36,510
taste that takes you there.

1524
01:32:36,510 --> 01:32:54,500
A plus.

1525
01:32:54,500 --> 01:32:56,500
That was an A plus.

1526
01:32:56,500 --> 01:32:58,500
That was to the point.

1527
01:32:58,500 --> 01:33:00,500
That was very much just to the point.

1528
01:33:00,500 --> 01:33:02,500
It was just, hey, Tabasco is fucking awesome.

1529
01:33:02,500 --> 01:33:05,569
When that first little drop comes out

1530
01:33:05,569 --> 01:33:08,130
it's like, this is cool.

1531
01:33:08,130 --> 01:33:11,310
It's like, yeah. Tabasco

1532
01:33:11,310 --> 01:33:15,859
is gross?

1533
01:33:15,859 --> 01:33:18,289
That's just

1534
01:33:18,289 --> 01:33:22,880
no. I don't

1535
01:33:22,880 --> 01:33:24,880
trust anybody that says that

1536
01:33:24,880 --> 01:33:26,880
Tabasco is gross. If you say

1537
01:33:26,880 --> 01:33:28,880
that Tabasco is not your favorite.

1538
01:33:28,880 --> 01:33:30,880
You say that Tabasco is something you don't choose.

1539
01:33:30,880 --> 01:33:32,880
I don't prefer Tabasco, but

1540
01:33:32,880 --> 01:33:36,140
saying Tabasco is gross.

1541
01:33:36,140 --> 01:33:40,300
I don't trust you. Mods, can we get a poll

1542
01:33:40,300 --> 01:33:44,140
real quick? Is Tabasco

1543
01:33:44,140 --> 01:33:46,140
gross? And remember, gross

1544
01:33:46,140 --> 01:33:48,140
does not mean I don't really like

1545
01:33:48,140 --> 01:33:50,140
it. Gross means like you taste it and you're like

1546
01:33:50,140 --> 01:33:53,729
ugh. Just regular, just Tabasco.

1547
01:33:53,729 --> 01:33:58,270
The default Tabasco. Tabasco on eggs

1548
01:33:58,270 --> 01:34:00,270
is amazing. Yes it is. It's also amazing

1549
01:34:00,270 --> 01:34:10,239
on pizza. Is it gross?

1550
01:34:10,239 --> 01:34:12,239
If this is more than 10 to 20 percent, then that's

1551
01:34:12,239 --> 01:34:16,979
no way. I want to do one more thing

1552
01:34:16,979 --> 01:34:22,460
after this before we keep going.

1553
01:34:22,460 --> 01:34:27,520
20 percent so far.

1554
01:34:27,520 --> 01:34:37,250
Gross? Why do you think it's gross?

1555
01:34:37,250 --> 01:34:43,069
Enjoy your vinegar water.

1556
01:34:43,069 --> 01:34:45,069
Don't ever have salad dressing ever again for the rest of your life.

1557
01:34:45,069 --> 01:34:57,619
Alright, alright, close that

1558
01:34:57,619 --> 01:34:59,619
poll. 21 percent said it was gross.

1559
01:34:59,619 --> 01:35:05,180
I have a new poll I'd like to run.

1560
01:35:05,180 --> 01:35:08,130
Because this is going to determine how I feel.

1561
01:35:08,130 --> 01:35:11,010
Okay. So remember, is it gross?

1562
01:35:11,010 --> 01:35:15,220
Is Sriracha

1563
01:35:15,220 --> 01:35:17,220
gross? New poll. Yes or no?

1564
01:35:17,220 --> 01:35:20,100
Is Sriracha gross?

1565
01:35:20,100 --> 01:35:28,220
Let's see. I'm curious.

1566
01:35:28,220 --> 01:35:43,199
I want to see how this lines up.

1567
01:35:43,199 --> 01:35:48,000
It's almost the exact same.

1568
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
It's actually almost identical.

1569
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,500
Do 20 percent of you just

1570
01:35:52,500 --> 01:35:54,500
don't like, you just hate hot sauce?

1571
01:35:54,500 --> 01:35:59,489
It's the exact same.

1572
01:35:59,489 --> 01:36:02,050
I think that 20 percent of you just don't

1573
01:36:02,050 --> 01:36:04,859
like hot stuff. So

1574
01:36:04,859 --> 01:36:08,050
it's good. Alright. I probably should

1575
01:36:08,050 --> 01:36:10,859
have worded this better. If you like

1576
01:36:10,859 --> 01:36:12,859
hot sauce, it's

1577
01:36:12,859 --> 01:36:18,500
whatever. I got what I wanted out of

1578
01:36:18,500 --> 01:36:22,960
this. I prefer Tabasco.

1579
01:36:22,960 --> 01:36:26,850
You know what I mean? You know what I'm saying?

1580
01:36:26,850 --> 01:36:29,659
You know what I'm saying? I prefer Tabasco.

1581
01:36:29,659 --> 01:36:38,479
You know what I mean? No, we're not doing a

1582
01:36:38,479 --> 01:36:44,500
no. No new poll. No new poll.

1583
01:36:44,500 --> 01:36:46,500
I like Cholula. Yeah.

1584
01:36:46,500 --> 01:36:49,119
But, very

1585
01:36:49,119 --> 01:36:51,359
important thing about Cholula. See, to

1586
01:36:51,359 --> 01:36:54,050
me, Cholula is

1587
01:36:54,050 --> 01:36:56,050
good on different

1588
01:36:56,050 --> 01:36:58,050
foods. I prefer Cholula

1589
01:36:58,050 --> 01:37:00,050
in a taco. I prefer

1590
01:37:00,050 --> 01:37:02,050
Cholula in, you know,

1591
01:37:02,050 --> 01:37:04,050
with like avocado and

1592
01:37:04,050 --> 01:37:06,050
not, I can't say which

1593
01:37:06,050 --> 01:37:08,350
one's better because I prefer

1594
01:37:08,350 --> 01:37:10,909
Cholula on very specific

1595
01:37:10,909 --> 01:37:16,590
foods, right? Tapatio is also

1596
01:37:16,590 --> 01:37:18,590
great. I would put it in the same category as Cholula.

1597
01:37:18,590 --> 01:37:23,390
Yeah, they're not exactly the same

1598
01:37:23,390 --> 01:37:25,949
kind of sauce, but I actually

1599
01:37:25,949 --> 01:37:29,600
really don't like Sriracha. I don't,

1600
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:32,100
I don't know. I don't like it. I don't think

1601
01:37:32,100 --> 01:37:34,100
it's gross. I just don't

1602
01:37:34,100 --> 01:37:40,369
really like it.

1603
01:37:40,369 --> 01:37:46,060
I don't vacation

1604
01:37:46,060 --> 01:37:56,800
in the South of- What is it?

1605
01:37:56,800 --> 01:38:02,300
This is a pretty, this is going to be a hard one. I'm going to

1606
01:38:02,300 --> 01:38:06,399
say coffee. Either coffee

1607
01:38:06,399 --> 01:38:13,119
or, I'm going to say life insurance.

1608
01:38:13,119 --> 01:38:15,489
A vacation planner.

1609
01:38:15,489 --> 01:38:18,180
I'm going to say it's, it's, it's

1610
01:38:18,180 --> 01:38:20,180
consumable. It's a coffee. It's a beverage.

1611
01:38:20,180 --> 01:38:24,529
An airline. That's a good one.

1612
01:38:24,529 --> 01:38:28,930
Insurance?

1613
01:38:28,930 --> 01:38:33,390
Okay. Okay. Let's see who's right.

1614
01:38:33,390 --> 01:38:35,390
Simple, I go

1615
01:38:35,390 --> 01:38:37,390
easy.

1616
01:38:37,390 --> 01:38:39,390
I go Greyhound. This

1617
01:38:39,390 --> 01:38:41,390
summer, go Greyhound anywhere, anytime

1618
01:38:41,390 --> 01:38:43,390
for $149 or less.

No restrictions or advance purchase.

1620
01:38:45,390 --> 01:38:49,039
I go simple, easy.

1621
01:38:49,039 --> 01:38:52,880
Greyhound bus.

1622
01:38:52,880 --> 01:38:54,880
And leave the driving to us.

1623
01:38:54,880 --> 01:38:57,250
This program is brought to you by

1624
01:38:57,250 --> 01:38:59,250

1625
01:38:59,250 --> 01:39:02,000
Okay, what's this one?

1627
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,000
brand new film.

1628
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,000
Ah, the Kodak Gold.

1629
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,819
Moncruise?

1630
01:39:10,819 --> 01:39:12,819
Introducing Kodak Gold Ultra

1631
01:39:12,819 --> 01:39:14,819
400. Why is this so chaotic?

1632
01:39:14,819 --> 01:39:16,819
A new film so versatile, it can catch rich,

1633
01:39:16,819 --> 01:39:18,819
accurate colors in almost any light.

1634
01:39:18,819 --> 01:39:20,819
Day

1635
01:39:20,819 --> 01:39:22,819
and night.

1636
01:39:22,819 --> 01:39:24,819
New Kodak Gold Ultra 400.

1637
01:39:24,819 --> 01:39:26,819
Would you trust your moment to anything less?

1638
01:39:26,819 --> 01:39:32,899
Holy shit!

1639
01:39:32,899 --> 01:39:34,899
This one, I can't even process this one.

1640
01:39:34,899 --> 01:39:38,420
All I know is I thought that was Tom Cruise.

1641
01:39:38,420 --> 01:39:40,420
Introducing Kodak Gold

1642
01:39:40,420 --> 01:39:42,420
Ultra 400.

1643
01:39:42,420 --> 01:39:44,420
A new film so versatile.

1644
01:39:44,420 --> 01:39:47,170
Dad, you did it wrong.

1645
01:39:47,170 --> 01:39:49,170
You don't blblblbl. After you take the picture

1646
01:39:49,170 --> 01:39:51,170
you blblblbl. Then you take the

1647
01:39:51,170 --> 01:39:53,170
photo. What a fucking amateur move that

1648
01:39:53,170 --> 01:39:56,750
was, huh?

1649
01:39:56,750 --> 01:39:58,750
Kodak Gold Ultra 400.

1650
01:39:58,750 --> 01:40:00,750
A new film so versatile, it can catch rich,

1651
01:40:00,750 --> 01:40:02,750
accurate colors in almost any light.

1652
01:40:02,750 --> 01:40:04,750
Day

1653
01:40:04,750 --> 01:40:06,750
and night.

1654
01:40:06,750 --> 01:40:08,750
New Kodak Gold Ultra 400.

1655
01:40:08,750 --> 01:40:10,750
Would you trust your moment to anything

1656
01:40:10,750 --> 01:40:12,930
less?

1657
01:40:12,930 --> 01:40:14,930
Why are you giving baby photography advice

1658
01:40:14,930 --> 01:40:16,930
to a person

1659
01:40:16,930 --> 01:40:18,930
like 20 years ago?

1660
01:40:18,930 --> 01:40:20,930
If you found a way to save America millions of

1661
01:40:20,930 --> 01:40:23,100
dollars a year, how would you tell

1662
01:40:23,100 --> 01:40:27,779
them? Introducing

1663
01:40:27,779 --> 01:40:29,779
1-800-Collect. Now

1664
01:40:29,779 --> 01:40:31,779
America's least expensive way to call

1665
01:40:31,779 --> 01:40:33,779
someone collect.

1666
01:40:33,779 --> 01:40:36,779
I thought it was going to be

1667
01:40:36,779 --> 01:40:38,779
how do we save?

1668
01:40:38,779 --> 01:40:40,779
To make the long distance charges easier for your friends and

1669
01:40:40,779 --> 01:40:42,779
family to accept.

1670
01:40:42,779 --> 01:40:47,579
I thought they were talking about

1671
01:40:47,579 --> 01:40:49,579
the government budget or something.

1672
01:40:49,579 --> 01:40:52,529
It's a number that

1673
01:40:52,529 --> 01:40:54,529
belongs to everyone. Everywhere

1674
01:40:54,529 --> 01:40:56,529
in the US.

1675
01:40:56,529 --> 01:40:58,529
Every time they need to make a

1676
01:40:58,529 --> 01:41:00,529
collect call.

1677
01:41:00,529 --> 01:41:02,770
1-800-Collect.

1678
01:41:02,770 --> 01:41:06,100
How does this sound?

1679
01:41:06,100 --> 01:41:08,100
Now you can have all the

1680
01:41:08,100 --> 01:41:10,100
crisp, refreshing taste of a

1681
01:41:10,100 --> 01:41:12,100
great beer without all the alcohol.

1682
01:41:12,100 --> 01:41:14,100
Miller Sharps.

1683
01:41:14,100 --> 01:41:16,100
Great beer taste

1684
01:41:16,100 --> 01:41:19,939
anytime.

1685
01:41:19,939 --> 01:41:21,939
Success in life is the result of

01:41:21,939 --> 01:41:23,939
preparation and having the right tools.

Look at my big fat

1723
01:43:13,439 --> 01:43:15,439
gun. He got

1724
01:43:15,439 --> 01:43:19,279
gun checked. He really did.

1725
01:43:19,279 --> 01:43:21,279
He got gun checked.

1726
01:43:21,279 --> 01:43:23,279
Everybody now.

1727
01:43:47,699 --> 01:43:50,189
You know what's so funny though?

1728
01:43:50,189 --> 01:43:52,189
I know I've been pausing a lot today,

1729
01:43:52,189 --> 01:43:54,189
but this is ridiculous.

1730
01:43:54,189 --> 01:43:58,189
You have to try

1731
01:43:58,189 --> 01:44:00,189
to do this. This like hurts.

1732
01:44:00,189 --> 01:44:02,189
Nobody actually

1733
01:44:02,189 --> 01:44:04,189
looks like that. Just sitting around.

1734
01:44:04,189 --> 01:44:06,819
They really don't. You have

1735
01:44:06,819 --> 01:44:09,569
to like, you have to like,

1736
01:44:09,569 --> 01:44:17,039
ah, that hurts.

1737
01:44:17,039 --> 01:44:19,920
I want to try it.

1738
01:44:19,920 --> 01:44:25,229
Is this weird? Is this

1739
01:44:25,229 --> 01:44:32,779
weird what I'm doing here?

1740
01:44:32,779 --> 01:44:34,779
Is this weird? This is weird.

1741
01:44:34,779 --> 01:44:36,779
This is kind of weird. I'll do it with the shirt on.

1742
01:44:36,779 --> 01:44:46,510
No, never mind.

1743
01:44:46,510 --> 01:44:48,510
This lady.

1744
01:44:48,510 --> 01:44:50,510
Just the, you know, the sunglasses

1745
01:44:50,510 --> 01:44:52,510
down like, I don't know

1746
01:44:52,510 --> 01:44:56,739
about what I see over there.

1747
01:45:00,260 --> 01:45:03,260
I want to like slow it down.

1748
01:45:03,260 --> 01:45:05,439
God damn it. It's so funny.

1749
01:45:05,439 --> 01:45:09,729
We need to make this slower. It's almost like he's

1750
01:45:09,729 --> 01:45:17,220
doing it on purpose.

1751
01:45:33,659 --> 01:45:35,659
How does he know what she is

1752
01:45:35,659 --> 01:45:38,479
looking at here? He does

1753
01:45:38,479 --> 01:45:44,880
it before he even looks down, right?

1754
01:45:44,880 --> 01:45:46,880
It's like, how did he know?

1755
01:45:46,880 --> 01:45:56,859
Why?

1756
01:45:56,859 --> 01:45:58,859
Why would you just

1757
01:45:58,859 --> 01:46:00,859
sit there just looking at

1758
01:46:00,859 --> 01:46:03,170
a group of people doing like

1759
01:46:03,170 --> 01:46:05,170
hey, look at how fat I am.

1760
01:46:07,340 --> 01:46:15,859
I'm reading too far into it.

1761
01:46:15,859 --> 01:46:18,029
It's doing it for me.

1762
01:46:18,029 --> 01:46:20,029
I don't know. It's fucking weird.

1763
01:46:20,029 --> 01:46:24,579
This guy actually like, he's

1764
01:46:24,579 --> 01:46:26,579
like, he's bent.

1765
01:46:26,579 --> 01:46:30,479
He's sucking it in.

1766
01:46:30,479 --> 01:46:36,109
He's doing it for you. What are

1767
01:46:36,109 --> 01:46:45,260
you talking about?

1768
01:46:45,260 --> 01:46:47,260
We're moving on.

1769
01:46:54,270 --> 01:46:56,270
It's a diaper commercial.

1770
01:46:56,270 --> 01:46:58,270
We're just gonna move on.

1771
01:47:06,270 --> 01:47:08,270
I can't get over that guy.

1772
01:47:08,270 --> 01:47:10,270
He's stuck.

1773
01:47:10,270 --> 01:47:12,270
He's stuck up here.

1774
01:47:12,270 --> 01:47:14,270
I can't get him out.

1775
01:47:16,270 --> 01:47:18,270
What the?

1776
01:47:22,270 --> 01:47:24,270
Oh, it's a joke.

1777
01:47:24,270 --> 01:47:26,270
It even slices and dices, makes thousands of

1778
01:47:26,270 --> 01:47:28,270
julienne fries. But wait, you can

1779
01:47:28,270 --> 01:47:30,270
play it too. This free Sonic 2

1780
01:47:30,270 --> 01:47:32,270
is a $54.99 value. You get two

1781
01:47:32,270 --> 01:47:34,270
Sonics for the price of one. Sonic 2 fits

1782
01:47:34,270 --> 01:47:36,270
easily into any tackle box. Made from a

1783
01:47:36,270 --> 01:47:38,270
space age polymer plastic for years of family

1784
01:47:38,270 --> 01:47:40,270
fun. And pets love it too. Buy the Sega

1785
01:47:40,270 --> 01:47:42,270
Genesis that comes with Sonic 1 and get

1786
01:47:42,270 --> 01:47:44,270
Sonic 2 free. Act now. Weiner dog

1787
01:47:44,270 --> 01:47:46,270
sweater sold separately. That was cute.

1788
01:47:46,270 --> 01:47:51,069
That was cute. I liked that one.

1789
01:47:58,779 --> 01:48:00,779
Three episodes for $4.95 including

1790
01:48:00,779 --> 01:48:02,779
the first episode ever aired.

1791
01:48:02,779 --> 01:48:04,779
Where is your bathroom?

1792
01:48:04,779 --> 01:48:06,779
Next to my bedroom.

1793
01:48:06,779 --> 01:48:08,779
Enjoy Cheers anytime you like.

1794
01:48:08,779 --> 01:48:10,779
I'm thinking about proposing.

1795
01:48:13,220 --> 01:48:15,220
Three episodes?

1796
01:48:15,220 --> 01:48:19,819
Excuse me, fella. I left a package in your mailbox

1797
01:48:19,819 --> 01:48:21,819
that belongs next door. That's the one.

1798
01:48:21,819 --> 01:48:23,819
Thanks.

1799
01:48:23,819 --> 01:48:25,819
Three episodes?

1800
01:48:25,819 --> 01:48:29,979
Keeping everybody?

1801
01:48:29,979 --> 01:48:31,979
Don't say adios to the good people at Cheers.

1802
01:48:31,979 --> 01:48:33,979
Keep the laughs coming with your Cheers video

1803
01:48:33,979 --> 01:48:35,979
cassettes. Deliver it right to your door

1804
01:48:35,979 --> 01:48:37,979
by five million women in uniform.

1805
01:48:37,979 --> 01:48:41,229
Use your credit card.

1806
01:48:41,229 --> 01:48:43,229
It's because it's a VHS

1807
01:48:43,229 --> 01:48:46,050
guys.

1808
01:48:46,050 --> 01:48:48,050
VHS's were at maximum

1809
01:48:48,050 --> 01:48:50,050
they were what? 90 minutes?

1810
01:48:50,050 --> 01:48:53,680
Yeah. Cause there was two

1811
01:48:53,680 --> 01:48:55,680
recording versions of VHS.

1812
01:48:55,680 --> 01:48:57,680
You could do 60

1813
01:48:57,680 --> 01:48:59,680
or 120 or 60 or 90, right?

1814
01:48:59,680 --> 01:49:04,079
What was the difference?

1815
01:49:04,079 --> 01:49:06,079
Was it the size of the

1816
01:49:06,079 --> 01:49:08,319
tape or something?

1817
01:49:08,319 --> 01:49:10,319
It was 120 max.

1818
01:49:10,319 --> 01:49:12,319
It was a lower resolution on 90.

1819
01:49:12,319 --> 01:49:14,500
It was the quality difference.

1820
01:49:14,500 --> 01:49:19,100
So weird. Hearing this now

1821
01:49:19,100 --> 01:49:21,859
this is so strange to see this.

1822
01:49:21,859 --> 01:49:28,130
Three episodes.

1823
01:49:28,130 --> 01:49:31,630
And guess what? Back

1824
01:49:31,630 --> 01:49:33,630
I know a lot of people might not be used to this

1825
01:49:33,630 --> 01:49:35,630
it used to take sometimes

1826
01:49:35,630 --> 01:49:38,060
two plus months

1827
01:49:38,060 --> 01:49:40,060
for you to get something that you ordered.

1828
01:49:40,060 --> 01:49:42,369
Like from one of these

1829
01:49:42,369 --> 01:49:45,569
hotline numbers. Sometimes it would take months.

1830
01:49:45,569 --> 01:49:49,149
Two or three months. Which is crazy.

1831
01:49:49,149 --> 01:49:54,850
Wow.

1832
01:49:54,850 --> 01:49:56,850
Read that fine print.

1833
01:49:56,850 --> 01:49:58,850
And call now for your first three episodes.

1834
01:49:58,850 --> 01:50:00,850
Cheers video cassette for

1835
01:50:00,850 --> 01:50:02,850
$4.95. Call.

1836
01:50:02,850 --> 01:50:04,850
Subscription is subject to review.

1837
01:50:04,850 --> 01:50:06,850
Sales tax added with subscription.

1838
01:50:06,850 --> 01:50:08,850
Wait, hold on.

1839
01:50:08,850 --> 01:50:10,850
Use your credit card and call.

1840
01:50:10,850 --> 01:50:12,850
Future three

1841
01:50:12,850 --> 01:50:14,850
episode videos sent every four to six weeks

1842
01:50:14,850 --> 01:50:16,850
and are $19.95

1843
01:50:16,850 --> 01:50:21,710
each.

1844
01:50:21,710 --> 01:50:24,779
Wait a minute. So it's $5 plus shipping

1845
01:50:24,779 --> 01:50:26,960
they give you three episodes

1846
01:50:26,960 --> 01:50:29,970
and then every two

1847
01:50:29,970 --> 01:50:31,970
months they send you three more

1848
01:50:31,970 --> 01:50:33,970
episodes but now it's $20.

1849
01:50:33,970 --> 01:50:42,029
How many episodes are in Cheers?

1850
01:50:42,029 --> 01:50:44,029
Can somebody look this up really quick? I guess I could right here.

1851
01:50:44,029 --> 01:50:46,029
How many episodes are in Cheers?

1852
01:50:46,029 --> 01:50:50,960
The whole series. There are hundreds of them.

1853
01:50:50,960 --> 01:50:55,569
There's like 200.

1854
01:50:55,569 --> 01:50:57,569
There are 273 episodes

1855
01:50:57,569 --> 01:50:59,569
of Cheers. Oh my god.

1856
01:50:59,569 --> 01:51:03,920
Hold on.

1857
01:51:03,920 --> 01:51:05,920
$20

1858
01:51:05,920 --> 01:51:08,539
for three episodes.

1859
01:51:08,539 --> 01:51:10,539
We need some math here.

1860
01:51:10,539 --> 01:51:13,489
So you'd get 91

1861
01:51:13,489 --> 01:51:17,010
tapes. It would cost

1862
01:51:17,010 --> 01:51:19,010
$2,000.

1863
01:51:19,010 --> 01:51:22,079
$2,000 for the whole

1864
01:51:22,079 --> 01:51:24,079
thing. And how long would it

1865
01:51:24,079 --> 01:51:26,079
take for you to get it? Like over

1866
01:51:26,079 --> 01:51:28,079
the course of like seven years?

1867
01:51:28,079 --> 01:51:37,550
It would take

1868
01:51:37,550 --> 01:51:40,880
years. They probably wouldn't

1869
01:51:40,880 --> 01:51:42,880
even be in circulation anymore by the time you got the

1870
01:51:42,880 --> 01:51:46,340
last episode. Weirdly enough.

1871
01:51:46,340 --> 01:51:49,220
This is very weirdly enough.

1872
01:51:49,220 --> 01:51:51,390
By the time that you are on

1873
01:51:51,390 --> 01:51:53,819
episode 200 or so,

1874
01:51:53,819 --> 01:51:55,819
DVDs I think have come out

1875
01:51:55,819 --> 01:52:00,239
by now. So you don't need this

1876
01:52:00,239 --> 01:52:02,239
subscription anymore. What were they thinking?

1877
01:52:02,239 --> 01:52:08,380
Maybe they thought that VHS

1878
01:52:08,380 --> 01:52:10,380
was just, this is it. It's VHS's.

1879
01:52:10,380 --> 01:52:14,340
That's it. You would need an

1880
01:52:14,340 --> 01:52:16,340
entire room for your Cheers VHS

1881
01:52:16,340 --> 01:52:18,510
collection. Yeah, it would be almost a hundred tapes.

1882
01:52:18,510 --> 01:52:21,899
And I think that would be kind of weird.

1883
01:52:21,899 --> 01:52:24,779
I felt like if I went over somebody's house

1884
01:52:24,779 --> 01:52:27,020
and they had a wall

1885
01:52:27,020 --> 01:52:29,460
just a huge bookcase

1886
01:52:29,460 --> 01:52:31,460
with a hundred tapes on it,

1887
01:52:31,460 --> 01:52:35,170
all of it was Cheers, you would

1888
01:52:35,170 --> 01:52:37,170
walk into that room and go, oh, nice, I got a

1889
01:52:37,170 --> 01:52:39,170
bookshelf. I wonder, what do you got? The Great Gatsby

1890
01:52:39,170 --> 01:52:41,979
on there? Oh, whatever. Every

1891
01:52:41,979 --> 01:52:43,979
single thing here is a Cheers VHS tape.

1892
01:52:43,979 --> 01:52:47,569
Every single thing on the shelf.

1893
01:52:47,569 --> 01:52:53,010
Everything. All right. I mean, that's

1894
01:52:53,010 --> 01:52:59,390
I wonder what these are worth now.

1895
01:52:59,390 --> 01:53:02,460
It's almost $4,000 today.

1896
01:53:02,460 --> 01:53:06,619
Wow. And right now you could probably go

1897
01:53:06,619 --> 01:53:09,439
watch Cheers on a ton of different

1898
01:53:09,439 --> 01:53:11,680
services and not have to spend like

1899
01:53:11,680 --> 01:53:15,970
five grand. You could probably just go watch it

1900
01:53:15,970 --> 01:53:18,399
right now. Even if you bought the whole thing

1901
01:53:18,399 --> 01:53:20,399
from like iTunes, it probably wouldn't cost

1902
01:53:20,399 --> 01:53:22,399
you even close to what, like

1903
01:53:22,399 --> 01:53:24,399
a couple hundred bucks total, maybe

1904
01:53:24,399 --> 01:53:26,399
if you bought every single episode

1905
01:53:26,399 --> 01:53:32,930
on like iTunes. But you don't understand, you're

1906
01:53:32,930 --> 01:53:34,930
saving on the first one.

1907
01:53:34,930 --> 01:53:36,930
$4.95 is a steal.

1908
01:53:36,930 --> 01:53:41,600
It would take ten and a half

1909
01:53:41,600 --> 01:53:43,840
years. Now, for your first three

1910
01:53:43,840 --> 01:53:45,840
episodes, Cheers Video Cassette for $4.95.

1911
01:53:45,840 --> 01:53:48,340
Call now.

1912
01:53:48,340 --> 01:54:03,489
This is the number one

1913
01:54:03,489 --> 01:54:07,460
eight hundred crook's least expensive way to call

1914
01:54:07,460 --> 01:54:09,949
someone collected.

1915
01:54:28,420 --> 01:54:49,920
We need to talk about the first one that we just saw.

1916
01:54:49,920 --> 01:54:52,930
That's perfect.

1917
01:54:52,930 --> 01:54:54,930
Okay.

1918
01:54:54,930 --> 01:54:56,930
Yes. I'm so happy

1919
01:54:56,930 --> 01:54:59,100
right now. Forget everything.

1920
01:54:59,100 --> 01:55:01,470
Everybody freeze. Don't move.

1921
01:55:01,470 --> 01:55:03,470
Nobody move. This is really important.

1922
01:55:03,470 --> 01:55:07,619
I don't want anyone to move.

1923
01:55:07,619 --> 01:55:11,520
Freeze. Okay.

1924
01:55:11,520 --> 01:55:13,520
I'm telling you right now, it's

1925
01:55:13,520 --> 01:55:15,520
impossible not to be, not to enjoy this

1926
01:55:15,520 --> 01:55:19,859
picture.

1927
01:55:19,859 --> 01:55:22,670
I genuinely don't think

1928
01:55:22,670 --> 01:55:24,670
you could not enjoy

1929
01:55:24,670 --> 01:55:29,600
the photo you're about to see. Do you know what I'm saying?

1930
01:55:29,600 --> 01:55:32,930
Do you see what I'm

1931
01:55:32,930 --> 01:55:39,710
saying? You can't

1932
01:55:39,710 --> 01:55:41,710
not enjoy this

1933
01:55:41,710 --> 01:55:43,710
in some fashion. Even if you don't think it's funny,

1934
01:55:43,710 --> 01:55:46,720
like this is an enjoyable image to me.

1935
01:55:46,720 --> 01:55:50,560
It kind of is.

1936
01:55:50,560 --> 01:55:52,560
And the best part is you

1937
01:55:52,560 --> 01:55:54,560
blurred, you blurred the

1938
01:55:54,560 --> 01:55:57,760
price. Because what is that

1939
01:55:57,760 --> 01:55:59,760
price? What?

1940
01:55:59,760 --> 01:56:01,760
It's cheaper now by how much?

1941
01:56:01,760 --> 01:56:03,760
What? I can't see through that blur.

1942
01:56:03,760 --> 01:56:06,000
I wonder what percentage

1943
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:09,329
point is going down. Oh my

1944
01:56:09,329 --> 01:56:14,449
god. And yeah, it's just question

1945
01:56:14,449 --> 01:56:21,859
marks. God, the internet.

1946
01:56:21,859 --> 01:56:24,670
The internet is like so

1947
01:56:24,670 --> 01:56:26,670
what a fucking insane place.

1948
01:56:26,670 --> 01:56:29,489
What a wild place this

1949
01:56:29,489 --> 01:56:34,739
really is. There's so much funny

1950
01:56:34,739 --> 01:56:36,739
things to see. So many crazy

1951
01:56:36,739 --> 01:56:38,909
things to look at.

1952
01:56:38,909 --> 01:56:42,300
This is insane. The internet is a

1953
01:56:42,300 --> 01:56:44,539
cool place. You should be careful.

1954
01:56:44,539 --> 01:56:50,180
Careful. Make it the stream

1955
01:56:50,180 --> 01:56:53,630
thumbnail? Okay, grandpa.

1956
01:56:53,630 --> 01:57:02,340
Should I do one too?

1957
01:57:02,340 --> 01:57:18,380
No, this is no dick. But this is me

1958
01:57:18,380 --> 01:57:21,380
reacting

1959
01:57:21,380 --> 01:57:23,380
to the video of the

1960
01:57:23,380 --> 01:57:25,380
person reacting to the price cut.

1961
01:57:25,380 --> 01:57:28,939
Okay. Here we go. Ready?

1962
01:57:28,939 --> 01:57:31,380
So I'm watching a video.

1963
01:57:31,380 --> 01:57:47,939
Was that good? That was pretty good, right?

1964
01:57:47,939 --> 01:57:55,170
Go on to the switch screen. No.

1965
01:57:55,170 --> 01:57:58,939
All right. We got to break down

1966
01:57:58,939 --> 01:58:00,939
these last ones we just saw. These are important.

1967
01:58:00,939 --> 01:58:08,539
These are very important.

1968
01:58:08,539 --> 01:58:11,939
The last one was weird because

1969
01:58:11,939 --> 01:58:13,939
it was just three, it was what? Three

1970
01:58:13,939 --> 01:58:15,939
ladies just chugging

1971
01:58:15,939 --> 01:58:18,819
iced tea?

1972
01:58:18,819 --> 01:58:21,760
Was it a contest? I don't know.

1973
01:58:21,760 --> 01:58:32,260
All right. But here's the next part, right?

1974
01:58:32,260 --> 01:58:34,560
We have

1975
01:58:34,560 --> 01:58:37,119
What is this a commercial for? He's

1976
01:58:37,119 --> 01:58:39,119
blowing his breath in this other guy's

1977
01:58:39,119 --> 01:58:42,000
face. Is this for

1978
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:44,619
gum? Mint?

1979
01:58:44,619 --> 01:58:48,079
You think it's gum? What if it's for like

1980
01:58:48,079 --> 01:58:50,079
a steak and cheese

1981
01:58:50,079 --> 01:58:52,079
or something? Or like a sandwich or something? Yeah.

1982
01:58:52,079 --> 01:58:54,079
I actually don't know. I don't know if it's going to be

1983
01:58:54,079 --> 01:58:59,630
mints. This is a tricky one.

1984
01:58:59,630 --> 01:59:05,779
I actually really don't know what this could be.

1985
01:59:05,779 --> 01:59:09,170
It's probably for mints, right?

1986
01:59:09,170 --> 01:59:11,170
There's no way they would do an ad where he blows

1987
01:59:11,170 --> 01:59:13,170
gross hamburger meat breath in this guy's face,

1988
01:59:13,170 --> 01:59:18,079
right? I don't think so.

1989
01:59:18,079 --> 01:59:20,079
I get a whiff of this. What? What?

1990
01:59:20,079 --> 01:59:22,899
Oh, that's very nice.

1991
01:59:22,899 --> 01:59:24,899
It's like a

1992
01:59:24,899 --> 01:59:26,899
petunia.

1993
01:59:26,899 --> 01:59:28,899
Breath savers with its cool minty core

1994
01:59:28,899 --> 01:59:30,899
gives you the ultimate fresh breath.

1995
01:59:30,899 --> 01:59:32,899
Breath savers. It's not going to be hamburger.

1996
01:59:32,899 --> 01:59:34,899
We're here asking kids how clear stick from clear cells

1997
01:59:34,899 --> 01:59:36,899
is working to prevent their pimples.

1998
01:59:36,899 --> 01:59:38,899
Look at this face. Yeah, it's the stuff

1999
01:59:38,899 --> 01:59:40,899
that feels like it gets under your skin to help stop pimples

2000
01:59:40,899 --> 01:59:42,899
before they stop. Clear cell clear stick and clear

2001
01:59:42,899 --> 01:59:44,899
stick. Those things were intense though.

2002
01:59:44,899 --> 01:59:46,899
You gotta just use it.

2003
01:59:46,899 --> 01:59:50,989
Do you find that life just takes

2004
01:59:50,989 --> 01:59:54,189
your breath away?

2005
01:59:54,189 --> 01:59:56,189
You better get on track.

2006
01:59:56,189 --> 01:59:58,189
Get on track with NordicTrack, the world's best

2007

Then get on track with

2014

Are you finding it harder and harder to make ends meet?

2020
02:00:25,039 --> 02:00:27,039
Your blood pressure is still too high.

2021
02:00:27,039 --> 02:00:29,729
You need to lose some weight.

2022
02:00:29,729 --> 02:00:31,970
You better get on track.

2027
02:00:39,970 --> 02:00:41,970
Is it NPC walking?

Are you finding it harder to make ends meet?

2062
02:02:05,739 --> 02:02:09,439
Stressful job. Stressful.

2063
02:02:09,439 --> 02:02:11,439
The doctor then tells this guy

2064
02:02:11,439 --> 02:02:13,439
you need to lose weight

2065
02:02:13,439 --> 02:02:17,659
to reduce your blood pressure.

2066
02:02:17,659 --> 02:02:23,550
It's not the stressful job that might be doing this.

2067
02:02:23,550 --> 02:02:25,550
You need to lose some weight. That's what's wrong.

02:02:57,149 --> 02:02:59,149
Still, your blood pressure's still too high.

2084
02:02:59,149 --> 02:03:01,149
You need to lose some weight.

2085

This motherfucker has a referral code.

Just exercise however you want.

2098
02:03:31,699 --> 02:03:33,699
That probably would do alright.

2099
02:03:33,699 --> 02:03:36,260
This summer,

2100
02:03:36,260 --> 02:03:38,500
guess who's coming to dinner?

2101
02:03:38,500 --> 02:03:45,149
Ha ha ha ha ha!

2102
02:03:45,149 --> 02:03:51,039
Son-in-law.

2103
02:03:51,039 --> 02:03:53,600
PG-13.

2104
02:03:53,600 --> 02:03:55,600
Review Sunday, June 20th.

2105
02:03:55,600 --> 02:03:57,600
Favorite for showtimes.

2106
02:03:57,600 --> 02:04:02,909
That's a good trailer for the movie

2107
02:04:02,909 --> 02:04:07,460
because, like, that's...

2108
02:04:07,460 --> 02:04:14,739
Oh, whatever.

2109
02:04:14,739 --> 02:04:17,939
This father's day, give him the

2110
02:04:17,939 --> 02:04:21,140
sensor, best a dad can get.

2111
02:04:21,140 --> 02:04:26,260
Kid buying that?

2112
02:04:26,260 --> 02:04:28,260
Respect.

2113
02:04:28,260 --> 02:04:30,260
Now the active ingredient has a higher concentration

2114
02:04:30,260 --> 02:04:32,260
of what keeps you drier. Secret's still pH balanced.

2115
02:04:32,260 --> 02:04:34,260
Just works harder.

2116
02:04:34,260 --> 02:04:36,260
Hangs in there, like you.

2117
02:04:36,260 --> 02:04:38,260
Strong enough for a man.

2118
02:04:38,260 --> 02:04:40,500
Now keeps a woman even drier.

Back before, you know, oh I'm just gonna go to YouTube and type this in or I'm gonna go to Spotify.

2133
02:05:37,149 --> 02:05:39,149
This was this was this was sick.

2134
02:05:39,149 --> 02:05:41,390
You got everything you needed. Everything.

2135
02:05:41,390 --> 02:05:44,340
All the big singles. All the big hits.

2136
02:05:44,340 --> 02:05:46,899
This was cool. A-.

2137
02:05:46,899 --> 02:05:48,899

2138

out of...

2142
02:05:57,199 --> 02:05:59,199
Alexandria, Virginia.

2143
02:05:59,199 --> 02:06:14,159
What is this?

2144
02:06:14,159 --> 02:06:20,050
Oh, it's Comedy Central.

2145
02:06:20,050 --> 02:06:22,800
Alright, where do we go from here?

2146
02:06:22,800 --> 02:06:24,800
Do you guys want 80s? More 90s?

2147
02:06:24,800 --> 02:06:27,869
I do have a couple of infomercials.

2148
02:06:27,869 --> 02:06:42,829
What do you guys think?

2149
02:06:42,829 --> 02:06:46,800
This one is a combo.

2150
02:06:46,800 --> 02:06:48,800
This one's Christmas commercials from the 80s and 90s.

2151
02:06:48,800 --> 02:06:53,979
This is like a combo.

2152
02:06:53,979 --> 02:06:55,979
This one's very long, but we can skip through it.

2153
02:06:55,979 --> 02:07:01,359
Alright, let's see what we got.

2154
02:07:01,359 --> 02:07:11,390
Queue it up.

2155
02:07:11,390 --> 02:07:13,890
Alright, here we go. This is a combo.

2156
02:07:13,890 --> 02:07:19,579
This, by the way, again, this is mostly

2157
02:07:19,579 --> 02:07:22,079
Christmas commercials.

2158
02:07:22,079 --> 02:07:25,340
This is mostly by the

2159
02:07:25,340 --> 02:07:27,340
kind of 4-3

2160
02:07:27,340 --> 02:07:29,340
thing they got going here.

2161
02:07:29,340 --> 02:07:35,229
Alright, let's see.

2162
02:07:35,229 --> 02:07:37,229
The Christmas ornaments of Hallmark.

2163
02:07:37,229 --> 02:07:42,930
Hallmark ornaments

2164
02:07:42,930 --> 02:07:44,930
aren't ordinary decorations.

2165
02:07:44,930 --> 02:07:46,930
They're special little presents.

2166
02:07:46,930 --> 02:07:48,930
For your family,

2167
02:07:48,930 --> 02:07:50,930
your friend, for yourself.

2168
02:07:50,930 --> 02:07:52,930
Keepsakes that bring back

2169
02:07:52,930 --> 02:07:54,930
warm memories of wonderful people

2170
02:07:54,930 --> 02:07:56,930
and wonderful times.

2171
02:07:56,930 --> 02:07:58,930
You'll find them only at Hallmark,

2172
02:07:58,930 --> 02:08:00,930
and there's more to Christmas than ever before.

2173
02:08:02,930 --> 02:08:04,930
That was cute.

2174
02:08:22,770 --> 02:08:24,770
Alright.

2175
02:08:24,770 --> 02:08:26,770
The young and the restless

2176
02:08:26,770 --> 02:08:28,770
will continue.

2177
02:08:28,770 --> 02:08:30,770
What are they recording?

2178
02:08:38,770 --> 02:08:40,770
What? The fuck?

2179
02:08:40,770 --> 02:08:42,770
Why were they driving?

2180
02:08:42,770 --> 02:08:44,770
Towards a picnic?

2181
02:08:44,770 --> 02:08:46,770
What?

2182
02:08:52,659 --> 02:08:55,789
To save a town in trouble.

2183
02:08:55,789 --> 02:08:58,159
They're driving towards the

2184
02:08:58,159 --> 02:09:00,779
people.

2185
02:09:00,779 --> 02:09:02,779
Why are you driving towards a picnic, then?

2186
02:09:02,779 --> 02:09:04,779
Why are you not going to the hospital?

2187
02:09:12,619 --> 02:09:14,619
One other thing, I know pause, Andy.

2188
02:09:14,619 --> 02:09:16,619
Another thing that's important to remember, though,

2189
02:09:16,619 --> 02:09:18,619
is a lot of these time slots

2190
02:09:18,619 --> 02:09:22,189
were, like,

2191
02:09:22,189 --> 02:09:24,189
seven seconds long.

2192
02:09:24,189 --> 02:09:26,619
How do you put a movie

2193
02:09:26,619 --> 02:09:28,800
trailer in, like,

2194
02:09:28,800 --> 02:09:33,789
four and a half seconds?

2195
02:09:33,789 --> 02:09:36,220
You can't.

2196
02:09:38,220 --> 02:09:40,220
This is C.B.S.

2197
02:09:40,220 --> 02:09:42,220
This is C.B.S.

2198
02:09:42,220 --> 02:09:44,460
This is C.B.S.

2199
02:09:44,460 --> 02:09:46,460
This is C.B.S.

2200
02:09:46,460 --> 02:09:48,460
This is C.B.S.

2201
02:09:48,460 --> 02:09:50,460
This is C.B.S.

2202
02:09:50,460 --> 02:09:52,460
This is C.B.S.

2203
02:09:52,460 --> 02:09:54,460
This is C.B.S.

2204
02:09:54,460 --> 02:09:56,460
This is C.B.S.

2205
02:09:56,460 --> 02:09:58,460
This is C.B.S.

2206
02:09:58,460 --> 02:10:00,460
This is C.B.S.

2207
02:10:00,460 --> 02:10:02,460
This is C.B.S.

2208
02:10:02,460 --> 02:10:04,460
This is C.B.S.

2209
02:10:04,460 --> 02:10:06,460
C.B.S.

2210
02:10:06,460 --> 02:10:08,460
C.B.S., C.B.S.

2211
02:10:08,460 --> 02:10:10,460
C.B.S.

2212
02:10:10,460 --> 02:10:33,119
Leaving the

2213
02:10:33,119 --> 02:10:34,479
I want to see that again.

2214
02:10:34,479 --> 02:10:36,479
Wait, what do you mean?

2215
02:10:36,479 --> 02:10:39,840
Oh hi, just keeping up with the Christmas rush here at the 50 off store.

2216
02:10:39,840 --> 02:10:43,920
Now it's that time of year again when everybody's trying to buy nice and save big on fine clothing

2217
02:10:43,920 --> 02:10:48,800
for the family, gift items, and toys. And at the 50 off store, they're saving 50% off everything

2218
02:10:48,800 --> 02:10:53,039
in the store every day. Well you know how we do that. We mark each item with the price you'd pay

2219
02:10:53,039 --> 02:10:56,720
in other stores, and when you check out, we total your purchase using those prices. Then with the

2220
02:10:56,720 --> 02:11:04,819
push of a button, we cut that total right in half. Guys, but they say the price you would pay in

2221
02:11:04,819 --> 02:11:11,300
other stores. Doesn't that mean that they're not marking it up?

2222
02:11:18,350 --> 02:11:22,750
Even Santa loves the savings and you will too. The 50 off store, where your money buys twice

2223
02:11:22,750 --> 02:11:28,670
as much for Christmas. This is ridiculous. This is ridiculous. KDBC TV, Channel 4, El Paso.

2224
02:11:28,670 --> 02:11:37,630
That's crazy. I don't know what to say. 50% off store. Your dreams of instant wealth may come

02:12:01,470 --> 02:12:09,090
rich. Don't miss out. Enter today. Butterball made Thanksgiving delicious. So for the holidays,

2230
02:12:09,090 --> 02:12:15,170
enjoy another deep-basted butterball turkey. Every slice is juicy. It's very juicy. It's a

2231
02:12:15,170 --> 02:12:19,810
butterball. Fresh or frozen, it's been the perfect holiday recipe for over 30 years.

2232
02:12:25,180 --> 02:12:31,819
This holiday, save an arm and a leg with Pam. Pam no-stick cooking spray makes baking a whole

2233
02:12:31,819 --> 02:12:37,020
lot easier. Pam, because how you cook is as important as what you cook. That's terrifying.

2234
02:12:39,180 --> 02:12:44,300
What's this? Bunny slippers? Of all the last-minute gifts you can buy,

2235
02:12:44,300 --> 02:12:48,779
one's appreciated more than all the rest. Wow. McDonald's gift certificates.

2236
02:12:52,539 --> 02:13:01,899
It's not at all, actually. No, it's not. A gift certificate gift card to McDonald's for Christmas

2237
02:13:01,899 --> 02:13:10,590
is like, that's cool. That's all right. But like, I mean, the slippers were kind of cool.

2238
02:13:10,590 --> 02:13:26,720
They were coupons. Jeremy, you're the McDonald's guy. Yeah, but I mean, it actually is kind of

2239
02:13:26,720 --> 02:13:37,090
cool if you think about it. But I don't know. I'd rather have the slippers. You're a walking

2240
02:13:37,090 --> 02:13:43,899
McDonald's ad. It doesn't mean I'm going to buy McDonald's coupons for somebody for Christmas.

2241
02:13:48,800 --> 02:13:56,699
Maybe like a stocking stuffer. Okay, hold on. This is important. I would not wrap this

2242
02:13:57,630 --> 02:14:06,529
in a big box. That's my issue here. This was wrapped in a big box.

2243
02:14:06,529 --> 02:14:11,970
Making a whole lot easier. Pam, because how you cook is as important as what you cook.

2244
02:14:12,770 --> 02:14:19,649
Hold on here. What's this? Bunny slippers? Of all the last-minute gifts you can buy,

2245
02:14:19,649 --> 02:14:28,859
ones appreciated more than all the rest. That came out of a big box. Cards always go

2246
02:14:28,859 --> 02:14:37,390
on the tree. That's right. Or in the stocking. That's right. You don't wrap in a big box a

2247
02:14:37,390 --> 02:14:47,899
gift card. McDonald's gift certificates. That's my issue. On the tree? That's cute. Like, oh,

2248
02:14:47,899 --> 02:14:56,909
whoa, there it is. Yeah, that's cute. The cold that pains you most at night isn't yours. It's

2249
02:14:56,909 --> 02:15:03,550
your child's. Introducing children's Nyquil with no aspirin, no alcohol. It's the nighttime

2250
02:15:03,550 --> 02:15:07,550
sniffling, sneezing, stuffy head, coughing so your child can rest medicine.

2251
02:15:12,270 --> 02:15:14,989
What was that? Night light will return right after this.

2252
02:15:25,869 --> 02:15:50,159
This tastes awful. Well, at least the videos are pretty good.

2253
02:15:52,079 --> 02:15:56,899
Are you going to bring me my lemon? Well, at least the video-

2254
02:15:56,899 --> 02:16:06,289
I cannot fucking believe. I cannot fucking believe that the Xbox Series S is getting a

2255
02:16:06,289 --> 02:16:15,229
price decrease. This is in no way- Those are pretty good.

2256
02:16:16,899 --> 02:16:19,779
Are you going to bring me my lemon or do I have to squeeze it from my hat?

2257
02:16:19,779 --> 02:16:27,920
From riches, to rags, to romance, to Goldie Hawn, to Russell, Overboard,

2258
02:16:27,920 --> 02:16:34,159
Radio PG. Merry Christmas from MGM. It's a Radio Shack Merry Christmas.

2259
02:16:34,879 --> 02:16:39,520
Wait, mom, everybody wants to say goodbye. My family loves this cordless phone from Radio Shack.

2260
02:16:39,520 --> 02:16:46,479
I got it on sale for just $69.95. I saved $30. It's really convenient. No cord in the way,

2261
02:16:46,479 --> 02:16:50,799
and you can dial out or answer from anywhere in the house. Even redial a last number call with

2262
02:16:50,879 --> 02:16:54,959
one touch. Merry Christmas, mom. Oh, and thanks for the tie.

2263
02:16:55,920 --> 02:16:58,079
The ET-395 cordless phone- Really wanted a cordless coupon.

2264
02:16:58,079 --> 02:17:01,440
Sale price for Christmas only at Radio Shack. You better next Christmas, ma.

2265
02:17:03,040 --> 02:17:07,280
Intelligence has identified a substantial buildup of hostile forces right here in our own backyard,

2266
02:17:07,280 --> 02:17:10,159
and I'm giving you the green light to clean them out. Gentlemen, you're the man.

2267
02:17:33,020 --> 02:17:40,590
You used a light gun? It's a Radio Shack at Radio Shack.

2268
02:17:40,590 --> 02:17:46,350
I saved $60 on this VHS remote-controlled VCR. These two-way bass reflex speakers were half

2269
02:17:46,350 --> 02:17:50,590
price at Radio Shack. This dual-powered calculator with memory was only $8.88,

2270
02:17:50,590 --> 02:17:55,629
and I saved $30 on a cordless phone for the family. Harry, I'm home.

2271
02:17:55,629 --> 02:17:58,350
Just finished our Christmas shopping at Radio Shack.

2272
02:17:59,709 --> 02:18:02,909
The Christmas electronics sale only at Radio Shack.

2273
02:18:06,989 --> 02:18:10,750
This is Bobby the Brain Heenan, and if you people out there have any brains, which I doubt you do,

2274
02:18:10,750 --> 02:18:15,950
you'll watch All American Wrestling on the USA Network, the best in professional wrestling

2275
02:18:15,950 --> 02:18:22,110
with the brain. That kind of reminded me of like a lot of sponsored deliverables.

2276
02:18:22,110 --> 02:18:27,649
It's like, Bobby, Bobby, we got to get you talking about the, you know, the network we're on and

2277
02:18:28,690 --> 02:18:35,979
we're going to go and it's going to be one take. It's just like, here we are,

2278
02:18:35,979 --> 02:18:50,610
this is what we're doing. All right, get me out of here. Bobby the Brain Heenan. I remember all

2279
02:18:50,610 --> 02:19:22,829
those guys. Mom, man, let's go. It's definitely for a video game and it's not going to look

2280
02:19:22,829 --> 02:19:46,030
anything like this. Harold, Harold, can we talk? Harold and I got a beautiful sale at $1.99 a month.

2281
02:19:46,030 --> 02:19:50,110
You know what that means? That means with a normal down payment, I've got a 21 foot hourglass fishing

2282
02:19:50,110 --> 02:19:54,670
boat. You guys want to go fishing. If you guys want a cabin cruiser, look at this cabin cruiser.

2283
02:19:54,670 --> 02:20:00,110
That's a Chris Craft cabin cruiser. There's the phone number, 432-9000. Whether you want a Chris

2284
02:20:00,110 --> 02:20:04,909
Craft cabin cruiser or the hourglass fishing boat, $1.99 a month is the sale, and we take trades.

2285
02:20:04,909 --> 02:20:08,989
We're open every day, seven days for your shopping convenience. It's Harold's Marine in Escondido.

2286
02:20:10,139 --> 02:20:19,389
I mean, that was, I like that one. That was, hold on, I'm getting overstimulated. Why was that,

2287
02:20:19,389 --> 02:20:25,459
like, why was that guy playing laser tag in a prison, a maximum security prison complex against

2288
02:20:25,459 --> 02:20:34,290
a bunch of like 13 year olds? That was what it was implying, that they're at this maximum security

2289
02:20:34,290 --> 02:20:47,389
prison. You'll watch all American wrestling. Where is this? This is, okay, this is not a prison.

2362
02:29:33,469 --> 02:29:40,690

This is a small area.

2470
02:41:18,459 --> 02:41:24,690
And there's a shit load of people here too. This is like being on the subway.

Good evening from Geneva where in a few hours an American president will meet face to face

2481
02:43:17,459 --> 02:43:23,860
with his Soviet counterpart for the first time in six years. Today was Mikhail Gorbachev's day as he

2482
02:43:23,860 --> 02:43:29,219
was welcomed at the Soviet mission here. He said the two sides had to do everything to ensure that

2483
02:43:29,219 --> 02:43:34,899
the situation improves. His wife Reza wanted some improvements in the weather complaining how cold

2484
02:43:34,899 --> 02:43:39,700
it was in Geneva. U.S. officials said that President Reagan was upbeat but as the two leaders go into

2485
02:43:39,700 --> 02:43:45,059
their historic meeting no one is promising any breakthrough on the main issues of arms control

2486
02:43:45,059 --> 02:43:51,219
and Star Wars. I'm Tom Brokaw, NBC News in Geneva. We'll have more news later on this NBC station.

2527
02:48:11,260 --> 02:48:20,500
Hold on what are you doing? That was an entire plate of food you dumped on somebody's head.

2528
02:48:22,180 --> 02:48:32,129
That's a wrap. Yeah she did that on purpose. You're holding it directly over her head.

2529
02:48:36,979 --> 02:48:42,739
These eyes right here no fuck that. These are I'm about to do something and I'm gonna try

2530
02:48:43,459 --> 02:48:48,979
to laser focus over here so people don't think what I'm about to know what I'm about to do.

2531
02:48:48,979 --> 02:48:52,430
Those are eyes they have intent that's going down.

2532
02:49:01,870 --> 02:49:07,790
The best part about this commercial is let's be honest with everybody here there's way too

2533
02:49:07,790 --> 02:49:14,219
much macaroni and cheese on this plate. Way too much. Like this is like five servings of mac and

2534
02:49:14,219 --> 02:49:25,420
cheese and a fucking apple. What are you doing? This person is shit faced. Why is she not moving?

2535
02:49:27,100 --> 02:49:35,229
Why are you not moving? She didn't even react.

2536
02:49:42,899 --> 02:49:47,540
No disasters it's the next best thing to China. If somebody puts an entire plate of food on your head

2537
02:49:47,540 --> 02:50:20,209
you're gonna fucking freak out. You're setting me up Nick. I probably have to bust my friend if I'm

2538
02:50:20,209 --> 02:50:31,010
gonna do my job and I hate you. It's the exact same voice. Close your eyes. I want everyone to

2539
02:50:31,010 --> 02:50:38,899
close your eyes right now. Don't open your eyes. Close them and listen. This forever. Close your

2540
02:50:38,899 --> 02:50:53,540
eyes. All of love's languages is forever. You're setting me up Nick. I probably have to bust my

2541
02:50:53,540 --> 02:50:59,139
friend if I'm gonna do my job and I hate that. A risky friendship. A shared attraction.

2542
02:51:02,420 --> 02:51:07,780
Dating is not a criminal activity. A dangerous mix. You are in the wrong place at the wrong time.

2543
02:51:07,780 --> 02:51:15,420
It's the same commercial. Michelle Pfeiffer, Kurt Russell, Tequila Sunrise written and directed by

2544
02:51:15,420 --> 02:51:23,569
Robert Towne. It's like diamonds are forever. You set me up. Like this is still the same commercial

2545
02:51:23,569 --> 02:51:32,639
and he has to fight and it's explosions. Oh can we do this one more time? I want to see it again.

2546
02:51:34,459 --> 02:51:39,979
I want to close my eyes through the whole two commercials. Can I do that? I know I'm like rewind

2547
02:51:39,979 --> 02:51:49,680
pause Andy. I know but like one more please. No one more. I promise. I want to close my eyes through

2548
02:51:49,680 --> 02:51:52,959
the whole commercial. No you know I don't we can just I'll turn the video off.

2549
02:51:56,530 --> 02:52:08,139
We'll watch it from here. All of love. All of life's celebrations. Just bear with me please.

2550
02:52:08,139 --> 02:52:43,620
Let's try let's see what happens. You're setting me up Nick. I probably have to bust my friend

2551
02:52:43,620 --> 02:52:50,659
if I'm gonna do my job and I hate that. A risky friendship. A shared attraction. So if I asked you

2552
02:52:50,659 --> 02:52:56,420
how maybe you'd accept. Dating is not a criminal activity. A dangerous mix. You are in the wrong

2553
02:52:56,420 --> 02:53:04,670
place at the wrong time. Gibson. Michelle Pfeiffer. Kurt Russell. Tequila Sunrise. Written and

2554
02:53:04,670 --> 02:53:13,020
directed by Robert Towne. Rated R. Oh that's so stupid. That would be an unbelievable commercial

2555
02:53:13,020 --> 02:53:20,450
though wouldn't it? It's like oh it's a diamond ad. No it's not. It's something else completely.

2556
02:53:20,450 --> 02:53:38,930
You look wicked ugly today. Okay that's so fucking mean. Starts Friday December 2nd at a theater near

2557
02:53:38,930 --> 02:53:45,459
you. There's only one place you'll find a furniture sale this big. All bedding and bedrooms.

02:53:46,020 --> 02:53:54,260
All dining rooms. All living rooms. All carpeting. It's all 10 to 50 percent off. Now only at Sears.

2559
02:53:56,100 --> 02:54:00,690
Need help? Yeah and I've got 10 minutes to get to the radio station. Ah here's the problem.

2560
02:54:01,649 --> 02:54:08,370
Stetson cologne. Easy to wear, hard to resist. And for that great smelling guy who started my car,

2561
02:54:08,370 --> 02:54:09,329
I get off at six.

2562
02:54:25,219 --> 02:54:31,299
Bring home this Jet Links car just ten dollars from Target. This backgammon set is also ten dollars.

2563
02:54:31,299 --> 02:54:32,500
They're both great gifts.

2564
02:54:40,690 --> 02:54:44,450
Buying holiday gifts at department stores could be a waste of money

2565
02:54:44,450 --> 02:54:50,370
because smart shoppers save money at marshals for the same. Dude hold on that was not a hundred.

2566
02:54:50,370 --> 02:54:55,329
That was like a child's drawing of a hundred. This backgammon set is also ten dollars.

2567
02:54:55,329 --> 02:55:06,799
They're both great gifts. That wasn't even close. Buying holiday gifts at department stores

2568
02:55:06,799 --> 02:55:14,459
could be a waste of money. That's not even close. You can't do that to real money? I know but at

2569
02:55:14,459 --> 02:55:21,950
least I mean why is he doing this? I see this shit. I see this shit on like like YouTube videos and

2570
02:55:21,950 --> 02:55:36,989
like TikToks. Why is he doing this? Like because smart shoppers save money at marshals for the

2571
02:55:36,989 --> 02:55:44,190
same brand names. This mock turtleneck sweater is just 17.99 at marshals. This silk blouse 17.99.

2572
02:55:44,190 --> 02:55:50,829
These earrings just 7.99 and this cardigan 22.99. That's a total savings of over 40%

2573
02:55:50,829 --> 02:55:55,950
off department store regular prices. So goodbye department stores and hello marshals. Well that

2574
02:55:55,950 --> 02:56:00,909
was under a hundred dollars right? Like you don't why would you burn that?

2575
02:56:01,549 --> 02:56:30,100
You know we're gonna be there. Don't think twice. Service is part of us. He got in.

2576
02:56:37,700 --> 02:56:44,979
Now we've seen it already. That's a wrap. The teacher was murdered at the high school.

2577
02:56:44,979 --> 02:56:51,700
They teach 60% off this week only at the music mart. That's a wrap. Things out there. It has a

2578
02:56:51,700 --> 02:56:57,860
mind that can reason. Something out of control but it's insane. The teacher was murdered at the high

2579
02:56:57,860 --> 02:57:05,299
school to destroy it. Why does the dog look interested in that too? As long as he's with

2580
02:57:05,299 --> 02:57:11,059
the dog his life is in danger. And I say we make a stand right here right now. From the best selling

2581
02:57:11,059 --> 02:57:19,700
novel by Dean R. Coons. Watchers rated R. Starts tomorrow at theaters everywhere. The dog was like

2582
02:57:19,700 --> 02:57:25,219
yeah I can't believe it happened. One place you'll find Winnie the Pooh learning toys and the Disney

2584
02:57:31,459 --> 02:57:39,790
It's only 40 dollars only at Sears. Towns in Europe had their own way of knowing the holidays

2585
02:57:39,790 --> 02:57:45,790
were near. It wasn't the decorations of the first magic snowfall. It was the appearance of special

2586
02:57:45,790 --> 02:57:53,870
holiday lockers in every pub and beer hall. Today that tradition lives in America at Coors introducing

2587
02:57:53,950 --> 02:57:59,870
Winterfest. Sucks that this works. So bold, so extravagant. We brew it only for the holidays

2588
02:57:59,870 --> 02:58:05,229
and when the new year comes the Winterfest will be gone but not the memories. It's I hate how this

2589
02:58:05,229 --> 02:58:17,520
works. I want one of these right now. It's just like uh I don't even like beer. When you uh seeing

2590
02:58:17,520 --> 02:58:23,709
the glasses like boom I really don't drink it. Which is I want to drink one of those out of that

2591
02:58:23,709 --> 02:58:29,440
mug. Only that mug. I don't want it out of anything else. It works every time on me. It sucks.

3040
04:04:51,860 --> 04:04:57,299
language or you know learning two or three languages when you're younger it's so much

3041
04:04:57,299 --> 04:05:02,399
your brain is developing and you can just take it in so much easier than right now and i can't do

3042
04:05:02,399 --> 04:05:13,200
it i i just cannot do it i always you know what it's interesting because i've always heard people

3043
04:05:13,200 --> 04:05:17,379
kind of talk you know by talking two different languages or you're like oh yeah i know this i

3044
04:05:17,379 --> 04:05:22,020
know that i know how to speak french and i speak spanish or whatever like and they can just go back

3045
04:05:22,020 --> 04:05:30,500
and forth like that i the way the brain works i'm trying to imagine like do you think in the other

3046
04:05:30,500 --> 04:05:40,719
language or do you translate it first and then say it right like do you think in english and then

3047
04:05:40,719 --> 04:05:46,799
translate it and say that just phonetically say the words or can you actually think in spanish

3048
04:05:46,799 --> 04:06:07,260
think in french think in swedish whatever what i feel like that's hard it depends both i think

3049
04:06:07,260 --> 04:06:15,260
in my native language and say it in icelandic really depends on a lot of context because i'm

3050
04:06:15,260 --> 04:06:20,219
trying to imagine a world where i would be thinking in a different language and like saying it reversing

3051
04:06:20,219 --> 04:06:28,750
it into english or vice versa like do you actually start to think in that language pretty cool it's

04:23:57,819 --> 04:24:03,420
with water add your favorite coffee and spin why do you need to spin it the fastest 60 ounces

3195
04:24:03,420 --> 04:24:09,520
of fresh cold i've used a cold brew baker a handful of times you don't you just put the

3196
04:24:09,520 --> 04:24:16,590
grounds in you seal it up why does it spin does that do anything brewed coffee in the world

3197
04:24:16,590 --> 04:24:22,110
and because it's cold brewed it won't get watered down with ice thanks to this press system coffee

04:24:22,110 --> 04:24:27,309
grounds are easily filtered and held on the bottom cold brew light medium or dark using any

3199

3200
04:24:33,229 --> 04:24:39,309
14 days ice drinks at the coffee shop cost about six i like cold brew but the same but what they

3201
04:24:39,309 --> 04:24:43,950
don't show you in this commercial in a quarter call now what they don't show you in this commercial

3202
04:24:43,950 --> 04:24:51,950
is how much kind of a pain in the ass it is because you'll do this it takes like wait what

3203
04:24:51,950 --> 04:25:01,500
did they say 14 days that's a long time cold brew makers are great but yeah you guys saying

3204
04:25:01,500 --> 04:25:07,020
already the issue with it is you do it you brew it and you make the amount of coffee you want

3205
04:25:07,020 --> 04:25:13,440
and then the thing is sitting on the counter and you you drink it and you kind of just go oh this

3206
04:25:13,440 --> 04:25:21,340
is a fucking mess and then you have to untake the thing apart clean it throw the grounds away wash

3207
04:25:21,420 --> 04:25:28,319
the thing grounds are everywhere it's kind of annoying it's really good though it's worth it

3208
04:25:28,319 --> 04:25:38,000
if you really like cold brew but col a lot of cold brew machines are cold brew makers i wish

3228
04:28:24,579 --> 04:28:30,020
my limit watching watching like two lord of the rings movies worth of old ads is i think is enough

3229

for my brain that was really fun that was very very very wild yeah all right so what do you guys

3230
04:28:51,360 --> 04:28:57,489
think you guys want more of this i don't want to overdo it though because i feel like it loses the

3231
04:28:57,489 --> 04:29:10,750
magic i think it's a lot of fun it's cool to look at kind of the way the world functioned and the

3232
04:29:10,750 --> 04:29:18,690
technology at the time and what people thought was interesting and it's cool please watch biodome

3233
04:29:18,690 --> 04:29:29,340
i mean i i don't think i can do that but i'll ask do mobile game ads i've actually wanted to

3234
04:29:29,340 --> 04:29:40,799
do that for a while but all right um so the plan was i was going to play driver tomorrow

3235
04:29:40,799 --> 04:29:45,950
but i do have some very bad news i'm not going to be playing driver tomorrow and he's a little i

3236
04:29:45,950 --> 04:29:50,290
need to set it up he's a little more time to set up but that's not what's happening we're not doing

3237
04:29:50,290 --> 04:30:13,520
that sorry so that's shocking do british ads i would i'll do that is it just as simple as looking

3238
04:30:13,520 --> 04:30:24,989
up uh 90s british ads and the same amount of compilations i'm imagining two canadian ones

3239
04:30:27,139 --> 04:30:46,690
you want me to be a commercial react andy i could do that the uk is so boring i mean i i don't think

3240
04:30:46,690 --> 04:30:50,690
there's probably tons of interesting stuff that came out in the uk for ads

3241
04:30:59,709 --> 04:31:07,520
yeah all right so here's the plan um i'm kind of doing this like one day off one day on one day

3242
04:31:08,319 --> 04:31:16,129
off one day on thing so the next time you see me i'll be here on sunday with hopefully driver and

3243
04:31:16,129 --> 04:31:25,389

3244
04:31:25,389 --> 04:31:38,750
get 30 40 minutes out of that game yeah frog detective makes sense depends on if i get obsessed

3245
04:31:38,750 --> 04:31:50,510
with driver i doubt it but you know weirder things have happened on this stream yeah same deal uh i

3246
04:31:50,510 --> 04:31:53,709
sus is going to be set for two don't be surprised if it happens earlier

3247
04:31:54,430 --> 04:32:02,159

3248
04:32:02,159 --> 04:32:16,079
it might also be 130 one could be it is 2023 yeah that was a lot of fun that was really funny
