1
00:00:03,129 --> 00:00:15,460
I'm changing the title. All right, let's play Dusk. I got it right here. Go back to sniper. Get out of here.

2
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:19,260
It was an interesting idea

3
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:24,219
I would just would have liked to go to other games the other levels instead of just playing on the same one for like

4
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,649
One to two straight hours

5
00:00:26,649 --> 00:00:28,649
All right dusk ain't coming

6
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:45,670
There it is loading tunes. This may take a while

7
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:48,890
Headphones recommended. I got them in

8
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:00,149
All right. Why is this taking a while?

9
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:02,149

Campaign endless save load. Let's go to settings. Oh, that's loud. Look feel

11
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:26,810
Look nice to have a 1080 full screen v-sync off weapon size drop that a little bit

12
00:01:26,969 --> 00:01:31,450
I don't like having huge ass weapons on the screen. I'm actually that's really cool about that 120 is my frame rate

13
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:35,689
Field of view 110. That's a little too much. That's puke inducing. Let's stay at like about 100

14
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:38,310

15
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:41,609

27
00:02:19,189 --> 00:02:21,189

00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:23,189
small circle

29
00:02:23,189 --> 00:02:27,590

89
00:06:55,930 --> 00:07:00,139
Drop the saturation and drop the contrast. I think that's okay for me

How much I get 56 bullets is it does it reload or does it just you have 56 shots?

98
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:05,899
Something below is calling us

00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:47,559
In the game where you sprint a hundred miles per hour and enemies are all over the place

111
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,720
Why didn't you get the secret room?

177
00:20:18,089 --> 00:20:22,940
Because well, I do more damage if i'm closer or

178
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:27,059
hammer

179
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:31,140
Yes, okay. I just want to make sure some some video games like this don't doesn't matter. What's this do?

180
00:20:32,549 --> 00:20:36,039
secret door opened

181
00:20:36,039 --> 00:20:40,630
secret door opened

182
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:53,210
Where somewhere else? Okay. Well, I got the key

183
00:21:00,619 --> 00:21:03,109
Is this like experience or something?

184
00:21:03,109 --> 00:21:05,750
Magic notes. I know it's a health increase. I see

185
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:13,509
I'm gonna get spawned on or something. Aren't I?

186
00:21:14,069 --> 00:21:17,259
What about the secret door?

187
00:21:17,259 --> 00:21:28,470
All right. Let me go back here. Is there a secret door?

188
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:34,390
Not really

189
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:35,670
In the house

190
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:46,789
I don't see a door here

191
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:53,700
Can I not pick what? Okay. What are those? Why can I pick that up?

192
00:21:53,700 --> 00:22:11,539
Oh already what's the secret? Oh, you can't have over 100 morale. Okay, cool

193
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:14,420
Um, what about back here?

194
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:22,299
I guess it wouldn't be a secret if it just you knew where it was. Can I get on the building?

195
00:22:34,869 --> 00:22:42,299
secret secret

196
00:22:45,059 --> 00:23:01,980
secret

197
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:05,180
Shoot this

198
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:07,180
Wait, that looked that does look like a door

199
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:18,539
Secret that's not that's not the right secret. That's not a door

200
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:22,069
This is pretty cool though

201
00:23:22,069 --> 00:23:26,200
I'm just gonna go I could find it another time

202
00:23:31,769 --> 00:23:34,329
Wait, let's hold on if I jump and I see where i'm going

203
00:23:35,049 --> 00:23:39,779
Hold on what about over here?

204
00:23:40,019 --> 00:23:46,900
There's like a shed over there. No, i've already been there. All right. We'll forget it. Wait

205
00:23:47,539 --> 00:23:54,579
I missed

206
00:23:54,579 --> 00:24:05,849
I'm so paranoid about losing secrets

207
00:24:06,009 --> 00:24:19,859
Oh, whatever. Let's go

208
00:24:19,859 --> 00:24:41,900
Do it. I know you're gonna do it do it. What else we got?

209
00:24:42,619 --> 00:25:02,009
One enemy left one out of six. Yeah

210
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:04,490
Yeah

211
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:06,490
old time religion

212
00:25:06,569 --> 00:25:18,579
This way i'm gonna save the shot. I have tons i'm using too many shotguns. It's too easy to use the shotgun

213
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:20,660
secret

214
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:22,660
He found the yellow key secret key

215
00:25:23,059 --> 00:25:41,690
There's gonna be a way down in one of these

216
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:48,789
What's that minecraft?

217
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:01,420
102 I thought I couldn't go over one. Oh

218
00:26:07,609 --> 00:26:09,769
Buried with his favorite video game

219
00:26:12,069 --> 00:26:14,710
Weird look at this is a secret. I'm gonna be okay. Remember that building

220
00:26:17,289 --> 00:26:39,559
Do you get more points for killing him with a melee blue I need the yellow key

221
00:26:39,559 --> 00:26:57,930
I hear something. All right, this chainsaw guy's over here. All right. Well, they get they've lulled me up with shotguns. So let's go

222
00:27:00,089 --> 00:27:12,940
Book and uh, bring it somewhere. I don't know

223
00:27:13,819 --> 00:27:15,740
It's probably a secret with that

224
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:37,700
I'm gonna put this back on like a little podium or something, right?

225
00:27:39,779 --> 00:27:41,779
This is kind of a long fall

226
00:27:42,500 --> 00:28:08,230
Throw the bible

227
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:10,230
There's no loot lift baits

228
00:28:10,789 --> 00:28:13,220
All right, what do we got behind this door?

229
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:46,410
That's a new weapon machine gun pretty good it's not bad I hear people walking

230
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,660
Oh my god the shotguns

231
00:29:02,579 --> 00:29:09,880
Nothing over here no secrets. Fuck

232
00:29:20,970 --> 00:29:29,640
I took a lot of hits there that I didn't want to take red key loot just health. I already have plenty of health

233
00:29:29,799 --> 00:29:31,799
so

234
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:38,500
All right red key blue key

235
00:29:43,849 --> 00:29:49,380
Jump while sprinting. Uh, i'm not i'm not smart enough to bunny hop. It's been proven time and time again

236
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:56,180
Does that

237
00:29:56,180 --> 00:30:00,180
Plus when I bunny hop it I go too fast and my brain is like a full second behind

238
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:03,220
So I can't play as good

239
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:20,650
Hurry up

240
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:25,619
What was that?

241
00:30:26,339 --> 00:30:32,009
Yeah, if I bunny hop if I go like insanely fast I can't even process the images on the screen

242
00:30:33,779 --> 00:30:47,670
All right, I got yellow

243
00:30:47,670 --> 00:30:51,990
That's the yellow key is for the no that I have the red. Do I have the red key now?

244
00:30:58,059 --> 00:31:00,059
What the fuck is going on?

245
00:31:13,029 --> 00:31:17,769
All right, that was kind of fucked up. All right, let's go. Where is he? Where is he? Where is he?

246
00:31:19,930 --> 00:31:30,009
Which way let's go this one not like it matters

247
00:31:33,269 --> 00:31:36,440
Oh

248
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:38,940
Give me back down. Put me back down. Put me back down

249
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:42,150
No, put me back down. I

250
00:31:54,619 --> 00:31:57,940
Okay, oh

251
00:31:57,940 --> 00:32:00,599
That was that hurt my head

252
00:32:00,599 --> 00:32:02,599
Anything in here that I need?

253
00:32:07,099 --> 00:32:10,819
Now I have blue

254
00:32:10,819 --> 00:32:13,539
Yellow blue and red which there's another door over here. Wasn't there?

255
00:32:33,259 --> 00:32:36,630
Move health good if we just go down again

256
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:40,230
That morale

257
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:49,210
Didn't I do this already?

258
00:32:49,210 --> 00:33:06,410
Wait, I already did this

259
00:33:06,410 --> 00:33:08,089
You got the key. Oh

260
00:33:08,089 --> 00:33:12,950
That's true

261
00:33:21,509 --> 00:33:24,950
We tried god for we traded god for demons

262
00:33:35,099 --> 00:33:37,900
The scourges of olden times

263
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:44,920
I think under the bridge. Yep

264
00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:12,070
Take them up

265
00:34:18,739 --> 00:34:22,340
Uh-oh, where is he? Oh god key

266
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:24,340
We

267
00:34:25,559 --> 00:34:29,429
Hallowed health and a super morale

268
00:34:34,179 --> 00:34:41,849
Blessed rng what do you mean? Bless rng? I only have two shots left in the shotgun. Not good. And um, i'm gonna use the pistols for a little

269
00:34:41,849 --> 00:34:46,730
bit

270
00:34:46,730 --> 00:34:49,369
That's a boss

271
00:34:49,369 --> 00:34:57,239
What did that do press the button?

272
00:35:03,579 --> 00:35:46,659

Uh-oh, you can actually you get drunk. What does intoxicated do?

275
00:35:56,900 --> 00:36:11,750

All right, that's good

278
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:23,750
I don't think I got any secrets

279
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:25,590
Bump up the difficulty

280
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:27,590
I think it's in a good spot

281
00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:30,090

282
00:36:41,079 --> 00:36:43,079

Fuck

284
00:36:50,619 --> 00:36:58,230
I just took so much damage for no reason you're destroying on this difficulty so far

285
00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:02,170
Uh, what do you think I should bump it up?

286
00:37:03,159 --> 00:37:05,880
To one more am I doing am I doing too well?

287
00:37:15,829 --> 00:37:18,539

289
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:26,090
You're talking like that's some kind of bad thing

290
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:32,949
Um, I don't can I even change the difficulty here? I can't

291
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:35,380

I don't think I got

300
00:38:57,179 --> 00:38:59,659
You need one more difficulty and it'll be perfect

301
00:39:00,219 --> 00:39:01,179
Really?

302
00:39:01,179 --> 00:39:05,530

I think you guys all thought I was gonna just do this

319
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:17,400
What the fuck?

320
00:41:19,699 --> 00:41:22,980
How the what's I don't fucking understand this is it's to I have to move that

321
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:28,420
This is fucking stupid. That's what you thought was gonna happen, isn't it?

322
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:33,300
And now you're upset that this guy is just holy shit look at his movement

323
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:37,619
Look at his skill. Look at how he's fucking moving around. I've never seen him like this before

324
00:41:37,619 --> 00:41:39,619
I've never seen anything like this before

325
00:41:40,619 --> 00:41:42,619
And I watch some of the top players in the world

326
00:41:43,260 --> 00:42:08,889
Oh, I don't even

327
00:42:08,889 --> 00:42:12,409
You guys forget there's one thing that I do well

328
00:42:13,050 --> 00:42:15,050

329
00:42:15,050 --> 00:42:17,610
Just fucking beat sakira. You know what I mean?

330
00:42:18,090 --> 00:42:21,610
If you give me a game where it just don't just shoot things hit things and don't get hit

331
00:42:22,329 --> 00:42:24,730
I might I might do pretty well. You forget this

332
00:42:26,090 --> 00:42:34,360
I mean I and speaking of forgetting I forget I have a yellow key now

333
00:42:35,699 --> 00:42:37,780
And by the way, this is not on the easiest difficulty

334
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:41,320
I've seen like this is on the third difficulty

335
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:48,489

01:02:27,079 --> 01:02:29,719
minus 50 speed on everything mode

485
01:02:30,360 --> 01:02:32,360

You know, maybe like two times less difficult and but just don't I I have it on the hardest difficulty

492
01:03:21,179 --> 01:03:25,579
But you guys have coded a special copy for me so I can pretend to be fucking awesome at this game

493
01:03:37,050 --> 01:04:01,320
Totally he already is we don't even need it. Dohly dohly this is intense, but it doesn't feel

494
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:07,719
And it doesn't never feels unfair even on the second hardest difficulty in the game

495
01:04:08,679 --> 01:04:10,679
I feel like i'm in control

496
01:04:11,239 --> 01:04:13,739
Does that make any sense?

497
01:04:13,739 --> 01:04:15,739
Sad

01:04:29,559 --> 01:04:36,760

504
01:05:14,619 --> 01:05:21,849

There's no way. Thanks a lot dev. I appreciate it for that like fucking extra copy of the game that you coded

510
01:05:47,510 --> 01:05:50,550
When I get with this five enemies surrounding me, i'm always gonna get out

511
01:05:51,510 --> 01:06:03,500
Okay

512
01:06:03,500 --> 01:06:12,070
If I get touched i'm dead. I hear a fucking chainsaw guy

513
01:06:15,639 --> 01:06:20,360
Those are the worst because now the difficulty went up. So they're 10 times faster. Which way is he?

514
01:06:21,800 --> 01:06:25,239
There's a red key. Oh my god, just stay. Oh my god. He's right there

01:31:03,989 --> 01:31:11,420
Is this vr exists for this?

693
01:31:11,899 --> 01:31:15,989
I just got destroyed

694
01:31:22,140 --> 01:31:29,819
Is that it? No, I can still hear them. What was up there?

695
01:31:37,399 --> 01:31:41,579
Weapon in there. How do I get in there? Teleporter?

696
01:31:47,510 --> 01:32:06,069
Well, i'll be damned. Look at that. Can this thing break? Or do I just have this forever? No

697
01:32:06,550 --> 01:32:13,289
Oh

698
01:32:13,289 --> 01:32:15,289
Cool. All right. So how do I actually?

699
01:32:15,529 --> 01:32:17,529
Progress I need to go through the teleporter

700
01:32:17,850 --> 01:32:19,750
All right, let's progress

701
01:32:19,750 --> 01:32:21,109
progression

702
01:32:21,109 --> 01:32:31,399
This way. Well, that's a really good thing to do. I guess I could jump on top no key though

703
01:32:33,720 --> 01:32:35,720
That's where the yellow key is

704
01:32:37,479 --> 01:32:39,000
Over there

705
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:40,760
Over no, where?

706
01:32:40,760 --> 01:32:44,170
here

707
01:32:44,170 --> 01:32:50,760
All right, i'll try the sword. I get the red key. Oh, I didn't get the red key. You're right

708
01:32:51,479 --> 01:32:55,109
Let me try the sword out though

709
01:32:55,109 --> 01:32:57,109
Seems like a fun thing to use

710
01:32:57,270 --> 01:33:11,850
What was the red door?

711
01:33:12,329 --> 01:33:14,020
I hear something

712
01:33:14,020 --> 01:33:23,430
All right. I'm

713
01:33:24,069 --> 01:33:29,659
I don't think I can excalibur these guys. I'll try it

714
01:33:32,569 --> 01:33:34,739
He just headshot me

715
01:33:40,300 --> 01:33:57,130
Holy shit, this is pretty good

716
01:33:58,810 --> 01:34:05,210
It's because of this guy in here

717
01:34:20,090 --> 01:34:21,689
Give me the soap

718
01:34:21,689 --> 01:34:49,510
Where'd it go? Where is it? Is it breaking? Pog. Let's go

719
01:34:50,229 --> 01:34:55,720
Dude pog, let's go pog. Let's go

720
01:35:06,539 --> 01:35:08,539
Whoa, I shit that guy went so fast

721
01:35:09,460 --> 01:35:12,420
Oh my god, what do I do? What do I do? What do I do? What do I do?

722
01:35:12,899 --> 01:35:16,199
What do I do?

723
01:35:16,199 --> 01:35:46,649
They can't get in if I have the box in front these guys move so quick. Damn it

724
01:35:48,090 --> 01:35:53,880
Okay

725
01:35:53,880 --> 01:35:57,529
Uh, that scared the shit out of me

726
01:35:58,489 --> 01:36:00,489
You're playing this like a horror game

727
01:36:00,569 --> 01:36:02,569
It is oh it is

728
01:36:03,989 --> 01:36:07,029
You don't think you're not gonna you you didn't scream at that part

729
01:36:07,510 --> 01:36:09,510
When you turned that corner you didn't scream

730
01:36:09,510 --> 01:36:11,510
I bet you did

731
01:36:11,510 --> 01:36:31,819
I bet you anything that when that happened you put your hand in the air and you went like

732
01:36:33,180 --> 01:36:34,380
Like I did

733
01:36:34,380 --> 01:36:40,649
Can't get up there

734
01:36:43,140 --> 01:36:53,510
This guy's gonna get up. I know it he's gonna do it

735
01:37:06,939 --> 01:37:12,569
Grenade wait ready here he goes one two three what just happened. Did you shoot that out of my hands?

01:37:42,359 --> 01:38:04,470
Blue key here he comes one two

738
01:38:08,380 --> 01:38:14,460
Son of a bitch son of a god. Damn it. He head shot me. They're too good

739
01:38:25,939 --> 01:38:31,909
This military

740
01:38:31,909 --> 01:38:33,909
This they have all right

741
01:38:34,939 --> 01:38:41,979
I did it back around the corner

742
01:38:43,800 --> 01:38:45,800
All right, let's just go with the sword

743
01:38:45,960 --> 01:38:47,960
Oh

744
01:38:48,840 --> 01:38:50,840
That was a huge mistake

745
01:38:51,079 --> 01:38:54,600
It was awful. It was a really bad idea, but i'm still alive and i'm mad about it

746
01:38:54,600 --> 01:38:56,760
Because I wish I just died so I could start with a bit more health

747
01:38:59,369 --> 01:39:01,449
All right. There's a ghost busters 2 slime gun

748
01:39:02,090 --> 01:39:14,380
It's a grenade launcher. He has to use two

749
01:39:15,180 --> 01:39:16,539
Pepe left

750
01:39:16,539 --> 01:39:18,460
Whatever, whatever

751
01:39:18,460 --> 01:39:37,140
What did that do gate control?

752
01:39:37,619 --> 01:39:52,409
Where's the gate?

753
01:39:52,409 --> 01:39:53,369
gate

754
01:39:53,369 --> 01:40:19,020
Where's the gate?

755
01:40:19,020 --> 01:40:20,460
Did I miss the gate?

756
01:40:22,090 --> 01:40:23,050
Uh

757
01:40:23,050 --> 01:40:43,739
Was it was I down here? No, not here. Where is it back where the blue key was?

758
01:40:44,539 --> 01:40:51,260
They're fighting each other. Let them fight

759
01:40:56,420 --> 01:40:58,500
Holy shit. This is chaos in here. Um

I already did

769
01:43:04,520 --> 01:43:06,149

770
01:43:06,149 --> 01:43:08,149

771
01:43:09,430 --> 01:43:11,109

772
01:43:11,750 --> 01:43:14,630

Well, let's go

785
01:45:33,050 --> 01:45:35,770
Use props. I mean props use props

786
01:45:42,789 --> 01:45:46,310
You can pick up boxes and you use props to go up there

787
01:45:48,869 --> 01:45:51,590
Wait, uh

788
01:45:51,590 --> 01:45:57,560
Can I crouch joan? Oh, well, I think I destroyed all the boxes

789
01:45:58,680 --> 01:46:01,300
We don't need everything

790
01:46:01,300 --> 01:46:05,460
We just need most of it

791
01:46:11,579 --> 01:46:14,260
That's a secret I just walked behind cars

792
01:46:16,659 --> 01:46:19,060
Use a barrel and then you called me a dumbass

793
01:46:19,779 --> 01:46:21,619
so um

794
01:46:21,619 --> 01:46:24,260

795
01:46:24,260 --> 01:46:26,260
Should I listen to that person?

796
01:46:26,340 --> 01:46:27,539
Very rude

797
01:46:27,539 --> 01:46:32,539
All right, just want to get that

798
01:46:54,039 --> 01:47:01,130
Got it. All right blue doors back here. I will not remember actually books and beer. I'll know that

799
01:47:01,529 --> 01:47:03,529
I will remember that one. Let's move

800
01:47:03,689 --> 01:47:14,100
Another secret in here. What is that? Why is that blocked off like that?

801
01:47:20,439 --> 01:47:30,170
Damn it. Really?

802
01:47:30,170 --> 01:47:32,170
No, I wanted to save that. Ah

803
01:47:32,409 --> 01:47:54,710
Can I get up there? I'm just making sure

804
01:47:56,890 --> 01:47:58,739
Secret located

805
01:47:58,739 --> 01:48:00,739
I don't think I can do this

806
01:48:03,619 --> 01:48:05,619
Whatever I can jump on top though. Can I?

807
01:48:23,380 --> 01:48:25,850
Just please

808
01:48:25,850 --> 01:48:29,210
How does that not kill you? I don't know. I should probably use the sword on these guys

809
01:48:30,170 --> 01:48:32,170
Instead of freaking out I just swing once

810
01:48:32,489 --> 01:48:40,779
They made that but I can't panic which is that's hard

811
01:48:41,340 --> 01:48:47,989
That's asking a lot

812
01:49:01,260 --> 01:49:05,979
Don't use the mortars here. I would keep the shotgun out. That's the bread and butter

813
01:49:08,279 --> 01:49:10,279
I feel safe with

814
01:49:10,439 --> 01:49:17,220
Need a yellow key. Shit yellow key is down here

815
01:49:18,340 --> 01:49:20,420
Into like the weird great sewer thing

816
01:49:21,140 --> 01:49:31,380
All right, so i'm just gonna keep going over this way

817
01:49:32,180 --> 01:49:34,869
I could jump

818
01:49:34,869 --> 01:49:36,869
What's it gonna jump to?

819
01:49:38,310 --> 01:49:40,310
Oh, can I jump to there?

820
01:49:40,470 --> 01:49:47,210
Let's see

821
01:49:47,210 --> 01:49:51,989
Oh, yes, I can

822
01:49:51,989 --> 01:49:53,270
I can do it

823
01:49:53,270 --> 01:50:08,100
Give me that first

824
01:50:08,100 --> 01:50:15,140
Shit, how do I get over there? I know I can get this

825
01:50:16,890 --> 01:50:21,430
Should I get a crouch jump into this?

826
01:50:21,590 --> 01:50:27,029
Because I hit oh here we are

827
01:50:38,439 --> 01:50:40,439

01:50:53,539 --> 01:50:57,699
I hear chainsaws. I hear them

831
01:50:58,340 --> 01:50:59,699
I hear them

832
01:50:59,699 --> 01:51:03,640
They're in here somewhere and down here. I know I can hear them

833
01:51:08,789 --> 01:51:10,789
Oh you prick, which way are you going?

834
01:51:11,029 --> 01:51:24,020
In a chest what's in it? Not a whole lot actually

835
01:51:24,819 --> 01:51:29,770
Not a whole lot. Okay. Well, I have plenty of shotgun shells

836
01:51:32,819 --> 01:51:34,819

837
01:51:35,060 --> 01:51:36,579

01:51:36,579 --> 01:51:38,489

Oh wait

870
01:56:47,909 --> 01:56:51,100
I got a good view

871
01:56:51,100 --> 01:56:53,100
Nope, it's just blue door time

872
01:57:05,979 --> 01:57:11,500
You take a lot of hits nice health good i'm ready i'm happy

873
01:57:12,460 --> 01:57:14,659
I like it

874
01:57:14,659 --> 01:57:20,810
There were 10 secrets in that level. Are you serious?

875
01:57:21,369 --> 01:57:26,199
That's a lot

876
01:57:26,199 --> 01:57:29,460
We are now at creations

877
01:57:33,930 --> 01:57:36,739
Pardon me, what's next?

878
01:57:38,020 --> 01:57:40,819
It depends

879
01:57:40,819 --> 01:57:42,260
What do I have to do?

880
01:57:42,260 --> 01:57:45,130
I got the

881
01:57:45,130 --> 01:57:46,649
the hallowed health

882
01:57:46,649 --> 01:57:53,109
Yeah, how do you respond to that question?

883
01:57:54,890 --> 01:58:57,979
Yes

884
01:58:57,979 --> 01:59:03,779
Scientists in here. This is a cut scene. Should I not fight? This is probably a cut scene

885
01:59:04,420 --> 01:59:10,600
Oh

886
01:59:11,159 --> 01:59:15,399
All right, that was pretty good cut scene now, what's what's the boss that this obviously is

887
01:59:16,359 --> 01:59:21,289
Let's go with uh

888
01:59:21,289 --> 01:59:23,289
My let's go grain launchers

889
01:59:23,770 --> 01:59:25,770
Open the door

890
01:59:26,090 --> 01:59:29,050
Uh, just stand here and wait open door

891
01:59:35,479 --> 01:59:39,020
Uh quarantine release do not touch

892
02:00:34,899 --> 02:00:55,619
Let's go what's next more buttons another code to crack I think I can handle it

893
02:00:57,689 --> 02:01:00,970
What are we doing for 100 health for and anything else I can grab while i'm up here

894
02:01:06,100 --> 02:01:08,819
Here's while I have a minute. All right, here we go. Save it here

895
02:01:15,659 --> 02:01:20,199
What um, wait, hold on

896
02:01:21,560 --> 02:01:27,079
Second experiment how many experiments are there? We got a lot of experiments in here

897
02:01:30,970 --> 02:01:34,569
Okay, well, uh, let's go

898
02:01:53,979 --> 02:02:04,340
All right, is there more experiments should I not have done that

899
02:02:05,350 --> 02:02:15,029
Wait, this is only the beginning

900
02:02:22,789 --> 02:02:24,789
All right, that was called creations

901
02:02:26,819 --> 02:02:30,970
That's cool

902
02:02:30,970 --> 02:02:32,970
I just I did it. I'd be level one

903
02:02:33,689 --> 02:02:43,130
The meat hook wounds in your back still throb as you make your way down the cold black and bloody hallways

904
02:02:44,010 --> 02:02:49,130
Uh that once held these monstrous creatures you leave the ruined town of dusk behind littered with the corpses of possessed

905
02:02:49,770 --> 02:02:51,770
hoping never to return

906
02:02:52,149 --> 02:02:56,949
This is standing imposing syllabus of what appeared to be military facility, but why a dark voice pushes forward

907
02:02:56,949 --> 02:03:02,390
Do you truly seek answers or is it simply too late to turn back continue the dusk experience in episode two?

908
02:03:03,590 --> 02:03:07,619
the facilities

909
02:03:11,159 --> 02:03:23,189
When's that come up new episode

910
02:03:24,789 --> 02:03:26,789
Oh, it's already here

911
02:03:27,270 --> 02:03:29,270
It's already here

912
02:03:32,170 --> 02:03:35,529
It came out today. Look at that. It came out today

913
02:03:41,770 --> 02:03:44,699
All right. Let me show you guys something

914
02:03:44,699 --> 02:03:47,899
This difficulty is not intended for a first playthrough

915
02:03:48,619 --> 02:03:55,380
This is my first playthrough. That's what i've been doing

916
02:04:01,619 --> 02:04:04,340
Do dusk mirror for one level. All right, i'll turn it on for one level

917
02:04:15,220 --> 02:04:17,220
How fast are the chainsaw guys?

918
02:04:21,270 --> 02:04:28,069
All right, because it's a new level. I don't like this. I want to have all my stuff

919
02:04:28,789 --> 02:04:39,369
I don't it's not about how fast you can go guys. It's about how cool you look

920
02:04:41,079 --> 02:05:28,220
I think I look kind of cool in some of these fights. That's they're too far away. That's not fair

921
02:05:35,159 --> 02:05:36,760
guns give me

922
02:05:36,760 --> 02:05:40,949
Any more guns? Yeah, of course. There is much if I didn't look back here

923
02:05:42,649 --> 02:05:48,979
I'm smart enough to know that now

924
02:05:49,060 --> 02:05:51,500
Maldi why am I malding?

925
02:05:52,300 --> 02:06:00,300
What the hell did I do?

926
02:06:00,300 --> 02:06:02,390
We got a raid

927
02:06:02,390 --> 02:06:06,310
Another raid. This is like raid two tonight. Damn tomato. What's up tomato?

928
02:06:06,949 --> 02:06:11,850
How the fuck are you dude?

929
02:06:11,850 --> 02:06:13,960
Hope your stream was good

930
02:06:13,960 --> 02:06:16,279
Welcome everybody that was in tomato stream. Thanks for the raid

931
02:06:16,920 --> 02:06:21,960
I wonder what you're doing. I don't know why I just did that this

932
02:06:22,439 --> 02:06:25,479
This is what happens when my brain has to focus on two things at the same time

933
02:06:26,279 --> 02:06:28,840
I just I just threw a box in there and tried to shoot it

934
02:06:29,560 --> 02:06:34,310
I don't know what I was doing. But thank you. Welcome everybody. We're playing dusk

935
02:06:35,189 --> 02:06:39,100
And I think I got everything I need to get the blue key card

936
02:06:41,369 --> 02:06:43,050
Red door is back here

937
02:06:43,050 --> 02:06:48,579
All right, i'm fucking ready. Let's rock and roll. You guys ready to see some action? Check this shit out

938
02:06:51,529 --> 02:06:56,409
Now I typically I if you guys are new to the channel typically I play the sims. I play the sims 3

939
02:06:57,289 --> 02:06:59,050
Uh four days a week

940
02:06:59,050 --> 02:07:02,329
But i'm known to play a little bit of ps gaming from you know, sometimes

941
02:07:03,289 --> 02:07:14,020
Oh

942
02:07:14,020 --> 02:07:20,199
But yeah, if you're looking for some sims 3 gameplay

943
02:07:21,720 --> 02:07:26,439
Uh so far we have about we have to wait 10 years going strong. I have an entire family tree

944
02:07:27,159 --> 02:07:29,159
it's been uh

945
02:07:29,159 --> 02:07:30,920
10 generations now

946
02:07:30,920 --> 02:07:35,479
15 people in the family. It's been going on for about 10 like 8 to 10 years on youtube and on twitch

947
02:07:38,039 --> 02:07:45,460
All right, let me get behind here

948
02:07:45,779 --> 02:07:47,699
Actually do that though

949
02:07:47,699 --> 02:07:59,500
What was the point of this?

950
02:07:59,500 --> 02:08:01,579
And i'll get up here do I have to do this?

951
02:08:05,109 --> 02:08:06,710
Oh, here we go

952
02:08:06,710 --> 02:08:25,210
Here we go up here and then around though. Is there anything on the other side on this one?

953
02:08:26,250 --> 02:08:28,250
I feel like there'd be something back here

954
02:08:28,409 --> 02:08:29,930
But there's not

955
02:08:29,930 --> 02:08:36,539
I have the blue fucking key. Oh god. Damn. What an imbecile. I didn't I didn't even know I picked it up

956
02:08:37,500 --> 02:08:39,500
I'm a sims player. Okay, sorry

957
02:08:41,829 --> 02:08:49,420
What is that

958
02:08:49,420 --> 02:08:56,420
That's a big fat guy

959
02:08:56,420 --> 02:08:58,979
Is he explode too? All right, they explode be aware of that

960
02:09:04,859 --> 02:09:12,649
Oh

961
02:09:21,210 --> 02:09:28,229
Dude, I kind of like going fast. Where's the big guy? I just heard him. Is it a flame thrower?

962
02:09:29,590 --> 02:09:48,069
Wow

963
02:09:48,310 --> 02:09:53,159
Okay, uh i'm on the other side rat

964
02:09:56,899 --> 02:09:59,779
Zoomer versus boomer. Who am I in this scenario?

965
02:10:06,420 --> 02:10:34,500
Oh, yeah

966
02:10:34,500 --> 02:10:41,029
Just the right amount just the right amount of shots. Sometimes you need to call in a friend

967
02:10:43,449 --> 02:10:54,140
And sometimes you need a friend. I will sit here and farm this. I don't care

968
02:10:58,359 --> 02:11:03,579
I ain't gonna let that happen. I'm not gonna go on the roof and get stomped by this guy

969
02:11:06,760 --> 02:11:09,239
Bad, but you bad bad bad, but you bad bad bad, but you bad bad bad

970
02:11:23,100 --> 02:11:25,100
Shots, right? Yep. Yep

971
02:11:25,180 --> 02:11:30,100
Uh, wait, give me the diamond

972
02:11:30,180 --> 02:11:32,260
Uh red cartridge cool

973
02:11:34,340 --> 02:11:39,100
Remember when jeremy plays a game that he has to focus 100% on

974
02:11:39,739 --> 02:11:42,539
You just get the names of things that he's looking at

975
02:11:44,489 --> 02:11:51,029
For all of his dialogue yellow key

976
02:11:59,260 --> 02:12:02,180
Okay, jump up

977
02:12:02,180 --> 02:12:04,180
npc commentary

978
02:12:04,180 --> 02:12:06,180
See imagine if I had not done this

979
02:12:07,529 --> 02:12:09,529
You guys would have been like don't tell him

980
02:12:22,760 --> 02:12:24,039
He doesn't know

981
02:12:24,039 --> 02:12:28,460
All right, good shotgun bullets. Wait a minute

982
02:12:28,939 --> 02:12:30,939
I thought that was a person. What's that super sickle?

983
02:12:31,739 --> 02:12:33,739
Ooh, should I get it? Yeah

984
02:12:34,539 --> 02:12:36,460
I think so i'm gonna try

985
02:12:36,460 --> 02:12:40,409
Let's do a little bit of balancing. Oops

986
02:12:40,890 --> 02:12:43,130
You know, there's no fault damage, right? Okay, good try it again

987
02:12:43,850 --> 02:12:46,810
I saw i'm a i'm a i'm a squirrel. I swear to god

988
02:12:47,369 --> 02:12:50,010
I'm just trying to get that thing. I'm just trying to get the little death star

989
02:12:50,729 --> 02:12:54,869
All right

990
02:12:54,869 --> 02:13:05,210
That way just this way. Can I jump from here to there somewhere?

991
02:13:06,539 --> 02:13:08,699
Uh, no, I can't how do I get up there?

992
02:13:09,979 --> 02:13:21,180
How do I do I can get up there? Hold on

993
02:13:36,739 --> 02:13:44,869
Now

994
02:13:44,869 --> 02:13:52,840
Yeah, come on. I'm trying to jump into that window

995
02:13:53,560 --> 02:14:16,979
Okay, I gotta slow down. Wait

996
02:14:17,699 --> 02:14:37,420
What's the play here I can't jump up what am I supposed to do though? How do I get up there?

997
02:14:43,779 --> 02:14:46,180
I did it. I did the thing I wanted to do but I didn't get what I want

998
02:14:47,289 --> 02:14:55,930
This guy wouldn't last two minutes. What did I just step on? I can get up there. Hold on. I'm gonna try to get back in there

999
02:15:10,500 --> 02:15:11,939
so

1000
02:15:11,939 --> 02:15:12,899
um

1001
02:15:12,899 --> 02:15:16,739
Other tower or something. Let me see

1002
02:15:19,819 --> 02:15:21,960
How do I get that?

1003
02:15:21,960 --> 02:15:33,659
Can I climb up that thing?

1004
02:15:33,659 --> 02:15:40,039
Wait, oh, there's a fucking gun right there double shotgun. Just get it

1005
02:15:41,000 --> 02:15:48,869
All right double shotgun

1006
02:15:48,869 --> 02:15:52,229
Okay, so

1007
02:15:52,229 --> 02:15:56,659
I want to get this stuff

1008
02:15:56,659 --> 02:15:58,659
But I don't I don't know how to do it

1009
02:15:58,899 --> 02:16:10,119
Okay, then

1010
02:16:10,119 --> 02:16:25,220
Help me

1011
02:16:25,220 --> 02:16:33,370
No, what do you mean? No, I'm asking for your help

1012
02:16:37,260 --> 02:16:41,610
It's more fun when you don't know

1013
02:16:41,690 --> 02:16:45,850
Obviously, I mean I have to go from here to there. I'm probably do I have to jump from there to there?

1014
02:16:45,930 --> 02:16:47,930
That's what I was thinking of trying to do

1015
02:16:48,090 --> 02:17:10,149
That's the only way to get over there

1016
02:17:10,149 --> 02:17:13,260
Okay, I i'm not i'm not quite

1017
02:17:14,219 --> 02:17:45,049
Correct though. Uh, what over here? Can I do anything with these?

1018
02:17:51,610 --> 02:17:59,139
Do I have to come back with a barrel though, it's probably something so simple that i'm not seeing

1019
02:18:03,100 --> 02:18:10,950
Let me try that again wait, it's f9 right there you go

1020
02:18:16,200 --> 02:18:18,200
Death from above what does that mean?

1021
02:18:18,840 --> 02:18:30,149
What I heard something

1022
02:18:30,149 --> 02:18:31,430
I'm hearing things

1023
02:18:31,430 --> 02:18:37,819
Should I get the magic sickle?

1024
02:18:38,629 --> 02:18:40,629
Hold walk to climb anything

1025
02:18:42,500 --> 02:18:46,180
Oh, oh

1026
02:18:46,180 --> 02:18:48,329
Hold walk what?

1027
02:18:48,329 --> 02:18:50,489
Hold walk to climb anything. What are you gonna?

1028
02:18:51,209 --> 02:18:55,059
Walk is shit

1029
02:18:55,059 --> 02:18:57,059
I thought it meant like just hold walk up

1030
02:19:05,270 --> 02:19:06,229
Oh

1031
02:19:06,229 --> 02:19:10,260
Now what do I oh no, okay. I think I blew it

1032
02:19:10,979 --> 02:19:21,909

02:20:09,719 --> 02:20:22,780
Oh, I know. All right. Where's the red door red key card red doors all the way back, isn't it?

1039
02:20:36,440 --> 02:20:40,969
red door

1040
02:20:40,969 --> 02:20:42,329
red door

1041
02:20:42,329 --> 02:20:45,100
blue door

1042
02:20:45,100 --> 02:20:46,620
red door

1043
02:20:46,620 --> 02:21:07,319
Just talking

1044
02:21:07,319 --> 02:21:12,600
That just swung around me new viewer here. I remember that happened to me too. It was not fun

1045
02:21:13,479 --> 02:21:16,040
Oh, thanks. Appreciate it. Welcome to the screen

1046
02:21:31,940 --> 02:21:34,899
What a wait, but what about the door? There was a yellow door

1047
02:21:38,059 --> 02:21:39,899
What was that yellow door?

1048
02:21:39,899 --> 02:21:47,180
New viewer here. Can you just gotta do a flip? Yeah. Oh, yeah

1049
02:21:47,819 --> 02:21:49,340
I've done it on stream

1050
02:21:49,340 --> 02:22:06,329
How do I open this? I know that means I could break it. I need to use the rivet gun

1051
02:22:07,610 --> 02:22:10,649
Lie

1052
02:22:10,649 --> 02:22:12,649
Oh, that's the rivet gun

1053
02:22:13,579 --> 02:22:15,579
Right. Thank you for that

1054
02:22:15,899 --> 02:22:25,819
Just extra ammo. Oh, there was extra ammo in that secret area

1055
02:22:26,700 --> 02:22:36,149
Oh

1056
02:22:36,149 --> 02:22:39,610
You know how I know people hate that

1057
02:22:39,610 --> 02:22:41,610
because yawning is

1058
02:22:42,250 --> 02:22:45,129
Seen as one of the most obnoxious things to hear

1059
02:23:08,780 --> 02:23:09,819
easy

1060
02:23:09,819 --> 02:23:14,299
What's this mess?

1061
02:23:15,270 --> 02:23:17,829
Oh red door. I need the red key

1062
02:23:19,030 --> 02:23:20,709
It's electrified

1063
02:23:20,709 --> 02:23:22,709
Am I gonna get killed electrocution?

1064
02:23:24,459 --> 02:23:29,590
artifact storage

1065
02:23:29,590 --> 02:23:31,590
Don't go in the ruins

1066
02:23:32,440 --> 02:23:34,360
Oh, well, I will

1067
02:23:34,360 --> 02:23:49,579
Don't worry. I will

1068
02:23:49,579 --> 02:23:51,420
Is that a person? I don't know

1069
02:23:51,420 --> 02:24:18,920
Let's go. Oh, there's nothing here. Wait. I got steered for no reason. What about that?

1070
02:24:19,479 --> 02:24:21,479
This looks suspicious

1071
02:24:21,639 --> 02:24:44,340
Where am I going? It's just a cool secret

1072
02:24:45,059 --> 02:24:48,709
Look at that

1073
02:24:48,709 --> 02:24:53,479
Oh, all right

1074
02:24:53,479 --> 02:25:10,500
Nice. It's very

1075
02:25:11,879 --> 02:25:13,879
I don't like how claustrophobic it is down here

1076
02:25:25,770 --> 02:25:28,170
You're gonna bust out of the jail cells

1077
02:25:29,590 --> 02:25:33,510
Is there I know it's gonna happen this happens in every video game with the someone at the end of the hall

1078
02:25:34,309 --> 02:25:38,149
Don't trust your eyes. Okay, i'm not gonna trust my eyes. I'm gonna run this way. I'm gonna go i'm gonna leave

1079
02:25:38,149 --> 02:25:40,149
I'm gonna go home. I'm gonna leave home

1080
02:25:41,899 --> 02:25:45,479
I think I killed something

1081
02:25:45,559 --> 02:25:55,540
Did I just kill one?

1082
02:25:55,540 --> 02:25:58,020
How many do I have to kill?

1083
02:25:58,020 --> 02:26:03,540
Oh, at least they have a lot of health

1084
02:26:03,540 --> 02:26:05,540
Don't trust your eyes

1085
02:26:05,700 --> 02:26:08,139
That means I could walk through this

1086
02:26:08,700 --> 02:26:12,459
Oh really? I thought that was gonna be like this is fake and you walk through the wall and this is the next part

1087
02:26:13,180 --> 02:26:17,350
How do I open this

1088
02:26:17,350 --> 02:26:25,100
Is there a switch to open this stuff?

1089
02:26:31,059 --> 02:26:33,059
Oh don't even need a switch

1090
02:26:34,309 --> 02:26:35,750
Got the mortar

1091
02:26:35,750 --> 02:26:42,790
He's talking about the invisible enemies

1092
02:26:43,190 --> 02:26:45,989
I don't know. I don't think so. I think he's talking about a visible wall

1093
02:26:46,870 --> 02:26:48,870
But like we have different opinions on it. So that's all right

1094
02:26:49,430 --> 02:27:01,690
That's what I think it is though

1095
02:27:01,690 --> 02:27:03,690
Very clearly that's what it is

1096
02:27:04,250 --> 02:27:18,620
All right got the turn the visuals off and do audio alone

1097
02:27:20,229 --> 02:27:22,309
I don't think that sounds like a fun game to me

1098
02:27:22,309 --> 02:27:23,510
Okay

1099
02:27:23,510 --> 02:27:31,059
Did my speed increase?

1100
02:27:31,299 --> 02:27:32,979
We're going faster

1101
02:27:32,979 --> 02:27:44,920
Where's the red door up here? There it is

1102
02:27:48,020 --> 02:27:50,260
Turn the stream up tweet your actions

1103
02:27:56,149 --> 02:27:59,430
Going down this hall now guys going down this hall i'm going down here

1104
02:28:06,840 --> 02:28:11,000
If I did that I would tweet more than I've tweeted probably in the last five years total

1105
02:28:11,879 --> 02:28:26,219
All right, it's invisible. It's invisible. Whatever it is. It's the invisible thing

1106
02:28:27,180 --> 02:28:29,159
Oh my fuck

1107
02:28:29,159 --> 02:28:42,729
Oh, that sucks

1108
02:28:42,729 --> 02:28:46,709
And they make the burger boy pterodactyl noise

1109
02:28:47,510 --> 02:28:48,870
that like

1110
02:28:48,870 --> 02:28:50,229
I can't even do it

1111
02:28:50,229 --> 02:29:06,299
You know the one knowing that those things are here. Oh, I hate it

1112
02:29:10,809 --> 02:29:12,809
invisible enemies really

1113
02:29:13,479 --> 02:29:14,940
invisible enemies

1114
02:29:14,940 --> 02:29:19,930
I was gonna give you a game of 9.4

1115
02:29:23,299 --> 02:29:48,010
Now it's in 9.3

1116
02:29:58,440 --> 02:30:02,360
All right, we good am I safe I think so I gotta open this though

1117
02:30:03,079 --> 02:30:10,889
Let's go there. How do I get back up?

1118
02:30:11,290 --> 02:30:13,930
How do I get back up?

1119
02:30:13,930 --> 02:30:20,329
Okay, excuse me the streamer asked you a question. How do I get back up?

1120
02:30:26,549 --> 02:30:30,389
Oh, no, it's the five. It's the 5g tower noise

1121
02:30:32,469 --> 02:30:34,469
All right, would you guys put your head?

1122
02:30:35,190 --> 02:30:37,190
Let's say this is the 5g tower

1123
02:30:37,510 --> 02:30:39,590
Would you connect your forehead?

1124
02:30:40,229 --> 02:30:45,829
To the 5g towers tip top like this and stick it on there for 10 seconds. Would you do it?

1125
02:30:47,989 --> 02:30:50,489
No, you wouldn't

1126
02:30:52,870 --> 02:30:55,590
But it's what if but it's so safe why wouldn't why won't you

1127
02:31:15,860 --> 02:31:18,819
You would get powers would you get powers?

1128
02:31:30,870 --> 02:31:32,870
All right, but when you do it

1129
02:31:33,190 --> 02:31:37,270
So you have to hold it there for 10 seconds, but when you do you own that cell tower

1130
02:31:37,350 --> 02:31:42,069
It's now yours and any phone calls and anybody's plans that go through that you get a month

1131
02:31:43,270 --> 02:31:47,829
That's what you get for like you get money a month like for anybody that uses that tower

1132
02:31:48,790 --> 02:31:50,790
Can I like get under here?

1133
02:31:50,870 --> 02:32:08,229
It's tempting

1134
02:32:08,229 --> 02:32:11,510
I probably should have opened that right now. I probably shouldn't have done that. I shouldn't have done that

1135
02:32:16,540 --> 02:32:20,620
Oh my lord. Holy shit. There's a million people. There's no way I was getting out of that one

1136
02:32:21,340 --> 02:32:38,760
with my

1137
02:32:38,760 --> 02:32:40,760
Not your head, but like the tip of your

1138
02:32:42,329 --> 02:32:44,329
Wait, would you just get electrocuted?

1139
02:32:45,290 --> 02:32:51,209
If you just went like

1140
02:32:51,209 --> 02:32:53,209
Yeah, and just placed it on there for one second

1141
02:32:56,920 --> 02:32:59,879
I have not slid at all this whole time i've played this game

1142
02:33:10,780 --> 02:33:13,579
Okay, so i'm seeing a lot of like yeah, sure. Sure. Yeah, sure

1143
02:33:13,979 --> 02:33:16,540
All right. Well the closer you get with your tongue the louder they're like

1144
02:33:18,299 --> 02:33:26,520
Gets

1145
02:33:26,520 --> 02:33:31,159
And you can feel like static electricity like pulling your tongue forward still doing it

1146
02:33:40,379 --> 02:33:42,379
All right, I gotta get in a good spot

1147
02:33:42,620 --> 02:33:44,620
and I gotta get my

1148
02:33:44,620 --> 02:33:47,110
Mortar gun i'm ready

1149
02:33:47,430 --> 02:33:59,299
Activated how much money we talking? I'll tell you in a second

1150
02:33:59,459 --> 02:34:21,270
I'll tell you so how much money we're talking about all the data that goes through the cell phone tower

1151
02:34:23,079 --> 02:34:28,120
Is you get it as you know, people have their cell phone plans. So you get a portion of whatever their cell phone plan is

1152
02:34:28,920 --> 02:34:32,260
Like you do whatever data comes through that tower. How do I get this?

1153
02:34:33,139 --> 02:34:42,870
Are you serious?

1154
02:34:42,870 --> 02:34:44,870
Well, I gotta I can still use it

1155
02:34:46,600 --> 02:35:01,420
Get the health. All right. Well fine. So here's the scenario you get you get five hundred thousand dollars instantly

1156
02:35:02,139 --> 02:35:03,510
but

1157
02:35:03,510 --> 02:35:04,950
by doing that

1158
02:35:04,950 --> 02:35:08,329
What you've just done is you have given yourself a reverse superpower

1159
02:35:10,629 --> 02:35:18,010
Which twice a year it will not this you don't know when two times a year you just violently shit your pants

1160
02:35:19,049 --> 02:35:22,889
Yeah, you get a curse

1161
02:35:22,889 --> 02:35:26,170
You don't know when two times a year. It's random on 365 rolled days

1162
02:35:26,729 --> 02:35:28,170
Could be any time

1163
02:35:28,170 --> 02:35:30,170
It could be one two twice in row

1164
02:35:30,409 --> 02:35:35,530
You get five hundred thousand dollars

1165
02:35:36,250 --> 02:35:44,440
You missed the first part of the scenario. Well, don't worry because none of it matters

1166
02:35:50,440 --> 02:36:04,809
It was a double red meat bread exit

1167
02:36:06,409 --> 02:36:14,540
What the fuck

1168
02:36:15,719 --> 02:36:39,739
Fair it's gonna laugh at me, right? Oh my goodness. We're still back here. I didn't know

1169
02:36:46,780 --> 02:36:48,780
Century going up

1170
02:36:49,100 --> 02:36:51,100
Oh century going up

Stop using the rifle for the small fries. It's my it's one of my favorite weapons and pinpoint accurate

1174
02:37:36,780 --> 02:37:50,969
Boring boring. That's one guy left

Somebody's gonna laugh my ass. Why did you write laugh my ass up? What'd you do that for? Tell me why?

1179
02:38:47,670 --> 02:38:51,190
Did I say I didn't say anything funny? Did I say something funny? When did I say something funny? When?

1180
02:38:51,350 --> 02:39:09,319
I didn't say anything funny. You got the last hit off. Okay yellow. Uh, i'm in trouble

02:39:33,739 --> 02:39:35,739
Should I save it? Yeah, just be good

1185
02:39:38,069 --> 02:39:40,309
Oh, man, I didn't think this was gonna happen

1186
02:39:52,520 --> 02:39:58,440
Jesus

1187
02:39:58,440 --> 02:40:00,649
Oh, man

Now i'm gonna go pick up all the stuff that I didn't pick up

1241
02:46:56,139 --> 02:46:58,139
the game's fucking good, but like

02:46:58,469 --> 02:47:01,750
Fucking god, man. I really don't get this fucking mad on stream really

Which number is it on? That's how we get rid of this guy

1253
02:48:15,049 --> 02:48:30,600
I can't believe it's the first time I've missed the whole game. I think although they're all done

1254
02:48:31,239 --> 02:48:48,540
Looks like it

1255
02:48:48,540 --> 02:48:50,860

What is this?

1275
02:51:24,149 --> 02:51:26,149
You just smoke a cigar

1276
02:51:26,790 --> 02:51:28,790
Why is my health not going down?

02:54:16,940 --> 02:54:21,299
I almost didn't get it

1300
02:54:21,299 --> 02:54:23,299
I fell down and just

1301
02:54:23,459 --> 02:54:28,469
You can actually flip in this game. That's pretty cool

1302
02:54:33,899 --> 02:54:35,979
The infernal machine that hurt

1303

The fall broke your flashlight. Uh, oh

1304
02:54:40,409 --> 02:54:43,139
That's not good

1305
02:54:43,139 --> 02:54:45,139
That's not good. I hate that

1306
02:54:46,979 --> 02:54:48,979
I'm not happy about this

1307
02:54:52,360 --> 02:55:05,700

Be good at the games. They don't waste any i'm not good at the game though claustrophobic in here to be good

1317
02:56:48,379 --> 02:56:57,780
New flashlight good

Holy god my fucking hand my hold on I have to restart but there was no reason why there'd be a door open behind me

1319
02:57:10,579 --> 02:57:16,790
And my brain hurts

1320
02:57:16,790 --> 02:57:31,579
Okay, where did you come from?

1321
02:57:31,819 --> 02:57:34,180

And soldier and scout

1334
02:59:29,459 --> 02:59:32,469
It was pretty good

1335
02:59:33,110 --> 02:59:35,110
You know back in my heyday

1336
02:59:41,299 --> 02:59:44,420
I would be number two with three or one on the top rag list

1337
02:59:45,459 --> 03:00:16,889
Did I miss the yellow key?

1338
03:00:17,450 --> 03:00:32,520
Did I not get him it looks like it opens this door opens elsewhere

1339
03:01:15,700 --> 03:01:38,739
All right, let's go i'm gonna try it good I can climb this

03:01:40,760 --> 03:02:22,409
Climb if I walk don't don't shoot the buttons

1341
03:02:44,950 --> 03:03:11,909
Not bad aim it has to be something like over here is there is there a spot I could go in

1342
03:03:13,030 --> 03:03:38,500
Is there an opening that i'm just not seeing because it's blending in or something

1343
03:03:39,459 --> 03:03:44,620
I thought it said don't shoot

1344
03:03:44,620 --> 03:03:46,620
Oh, it's a joke

1345
03:03:50,280 --> 03:03:53,639
Didn't I shoot it i'm confused I thought I shot the damn thing

1346
03:03:54,520 --> 03:04:09,770
Give me a bad aim. I shot it like 15 times

1347
03:04:11,770 --> 03:04:13,049

1348
03:04:13,049 --> 03:04:35,700

1349
03:04:37,000 --> 03:04:42,040
And you missed no, I did not miss I was just not I apparently wasn't close enough. I shot it straight on

1350
03:04:42,280 --> 03:04:44,680
Go look at the clip. I don't even do whatever I do bend myself

1351
03:04:45,319 --> 03:04:47,319
I don't look at the clip

1352
03:04:47,799 --> 03:04:55,659
That's un-fucking-believable just restarted. Oh my god

1353
03:04:56,379 --> 03:05:09,819

03:09:24,260 --> 03:09:52,440
No, we're doing it my way. You can't just ban people to solve your problems. Yes, I can

1373
03:09:57,819 --> 03:09:59,479
Whoa

1374
03:09:59,479 --> 03:10:00,760

03:10:00,760 --> 03:10:06,069
Why are you still alive?

1376
03:10:06,069 --> 03:10:10,729
This guy made out of fucking titanium. I don't understand

1377
03:10:11,610 --> 03:10:22,040
I can ban away all my problems

1378
03:10:23,079 --> 03:10:28,260
Somebody says hey streamer, you're an idiot ban them

1379

1381
03:11:30,540 --> 03:11:34,940
Like that was just delete that whole clip. It was not even worth watching

1382
03:11:36,059 --> 03:11:39,690
I could have done it better, but um, it's it's been um, it's it's getting late

1383
03:11:40,729 --> 03:11:51,860

Welcome, what's up? Hope you having a good day

1386
03:12:32,569 --> 03:12:40,709
First thought what's your first thought coming in here? What's the first thing that you're thinking of right now? What's the first thing?

1387
03:12:50,739 --> 03:12:52,659
You go maniac

1388
03:12:52,659 --> 03:12:54,659
All right. Yeah, I was supposed to go in the door

1389
03:12:54,979 --> 03:13:10,899
The door over here because there was

Not bad. Oh shit. I'm gonna start using mortars. I have so many of them. What's the river to ammo look like?

1391
03:14:12,680 --> 03:14:14,760
Best weapon my favorite weapon in the game got it

1392
03:14:19,819 --> 03:14:30,760
This door opens elsewhere, of course

1393
03:14:35,540 --> 03:14:43,959
Oh, I know where it opens

1394
03:14:43,959 --> 03:14:46,709
Get out of here

1395
03:14:46,790 --> 03:14:49,340
Fuck out of here anymore

1396
03:14:58,219 --> 03:15:00,219
Goats have gone mad

1397
03:15:01,100 --> 03:15:04,860
I figure there's gonna be one right there. This one's I can hear them

1398
03:15:05,659 --> 03:15:26,649
Does that mean i'm gonna get the crossbow?

1399
03:15:30,500 --> 03:15:32,500
I would hope so

1400
03:15:32,819 --> 03:15:36,149
Oh crossbow

1401
03:15:36,709 --> 03:15:46,700

Not worth using that

1411
03:16:43,770 --> 03:16:46,569
All right, here we go just open a bolt just in case I did it wrong

1412
03:16:47,850 --> 03:16:52,409
Good thing I did that this guy would have collapsed on me. He sneaked. I was sneaking up behind me

1413
03:16:55,340 --> 03:17:13,350
The hatch is open so what?

1414
03:17:24,780 --> 03:17:27,620
So what?

1415
03:17:27,620 --> 03:17:45,540
Where's this hatch i'm looking at?

1416
03:17:46,819 --> 03:18:00,420
The hatch is open is this the hatch that's down here? That looks like a hatch

1417
03:18:21,799 --> 03:18:26,790
It depends on what you mean by that

1418
03:18:28,329 --> 03:18:30,329
Holy shit

03:23:54,840 --> 03:24:19,079
Every time you kill one of the guys sounds like you grunting I guess so Jesus let's get the fuck out of me

1448
03:24:19,079 --> 03:24:21,079

Holy shit

1456
03:26:21,819 --> 03:26:24,379

I got the yellow key

1460
03:26:36,860 --> 03:26:41,159
Hardest difficulty is one hit one kill for everybody

1461
03:26:41,959 --> 03:26:48,360
That's kind of scary

1462
03:26:48,360 --> 03:26:50,360
Wow, I gotta try that

1463
03:26:50,440 --> 03:27:00,170

04:10:35,719 --> 04:10:37,719
All right, we're gonna write these a couple of these down

1708
04:10:38,569 --> 04:10:41,690
Also, if you have game suggestions, make sure you throw them not just on here

1709
04:10:41,690 --> 04:10:44,090
But make sure you put them in the actual recommended discord channel

1710
04:10:45,049 --> 04:10:48,329
I check that all the time. I'm always scrolling through there. So

1711
04:10:49,049 --> 04:10:51,930
If you're not part of the discord draw the discord too. It's open to the public

1712
04:10:52,409 --> 04:10:55,209
There's a sub room, but it's pretty much just completely open

1713
04:10:57,620 --> 04:11:00,819
I came in wanting to see dusk. I got you baited. Well, you're gonna be real happy

1714
04:11:01,459 --> 04:11:03,459
Because i'm playing it tomorrow, too

1715
04:11:04,100 --> 04:11:06,100
Hopefully get to the end of the whole thing

1716
04:11:09,940 --> 04:11:13,780
That clip is really yeah careful listening to that clip. This is one of the loudest things i've ever done on stream

1717
04:11:14,420 --> 04:11:17,239
But thank you lost fables

1718
04:11:17,239 --> 04:11:19,879
Don't worry if you're not a sub

1719
04:11:19,879 --> 04:11:23,379
Thanks for watching regardless

1720
04:11:23,379 --> 04:11:27,459
Uh, mr mcgee guy. I don't even know why I don't I added mister

1721
04:11:28,180 --> 04:11:35,049
To your name. That's not your name. Your name is mcgee guy. It's not mr mcgee. I don't know why I said mister

1722
04:11:37,500 --> 04:11:39,500
Mr one guy

1723
04:11:39,500 --> 04:11:42,780
Thanks for the 1500 bits. There's no message here, but just 1500. Thank you

1724
04:11:45,350 --> 04:11:48,950
Dark soul, thanks for the 250 bits finally done with my 70 hour work week

1725
04:11:49,430 --> 04:12:00,860
But by all means take half of it. You worked 70 hours and made five dollars. That's not good

1726
04:12:01,340 --> 04:12:05,159
That's really not good

1727
04:12:05,159 --> 04:12:09,930
Is that was that like

1728
04:12:09,930 --> 04:12:12,360
76 cents an hour

1729
04:12:12,360 --> 04:12:14,659
That's not good

1730
04:12:14,659 --> 04:12:18,659
The children can eat their beds made from amazon boxes. That's okay. But actually thank you for streaming

1731
04:12:19,850 --> 04:12:24,729
Also, you're really cute. Please play metroid prime. I have like three days before I consume the game cube

1732
04:12:27,350 --> 04:12:29,350
Uh, we had a couple of raids we had uh

1733
04:12:30,729 --> 04:12:35,770
Tomato came in with a raid. Thanks tomato. Thank you. If you're still watching from tomatoes

1734
04:12:36,329 --> 04:12:38,010
Stream, thanks a lot guys

1735
04:12:38,010 --> 04:12:41,780
Hope you enjoyed it. We'll be doing it tomorrow, too

1736
04:12:42,420 --> 04:12:45,500
and we also had a raid from

1737
04:12:45,739 --> 04:12:47,420
Uh lazy purple

1738
04:12:47,420 --> 04:12:50,969
As well, so thanks both of you appreciate it

1739
04:12:57,239 --> 04:12:59,239
Let's put the subs on the screen

1740
04:13:00,120 --> 04:13:02,120
and go to this

1741
04:13:02,500 --> 04:13:07,899
Hopefully the camera's not on I just start wearing shirts to turn it if I need to

1742
04:13:08,979 --> 04:13:14,629
Thanks everybody for your subs

1743
04:13:14,629 --> 04:13:18,469
All of you, you're all fucking incredibly special to me

1744
04:13:21,850 --> 04:13:24,250
There are a lot of you. Thanks. Look seriously. Thank you

Nice boy. Haha. What is he called a special the dev sub to you?

1746
04:13:37,290 --> 04:13:38,969
That's that's fun

1747
04:13:38,969 --> 04:13:43,750
Who actually who made the game who actually what was it? What studio was it?

1748
04:13:44,389 --> 04:13:46,100
It's really good

1749
04:13:46,100 --> 04:13:55,450
Who made this who made this game?

1750
04:13:58,139 --> 04:14:01,899
I okay. This is how stupid I am. I went into steam and I typed into the search bar studio

1751
04:14:04,680 --> 04:14:09,030
Dusk, okay. Oh, it's just me

1752
04:14:09,430 --> 04:14:13,559
Just made by one guy

1753
04:14:13,559 --> 04:14:18,120
Really? It's just me. It's one guy just well not probably not but just david

1754
04:14:23,190 --> 04:14:24,389
developer

1755
04:14:24,389 --> 04:14:28,329
David so that's the david you guys talking about. Oh, that's cool

1756
04:14:29,049 --> 04:14:30,889
Well, the game's awesome. So

1757
04:14:30,889 --> 04:14:40,969
Look forward to what you do in the future

1758
04:14:40,969 --> 04:14:43,770
But uh, let's keep going because I gotta get out of here

1759
04:14:45,540 --> 04:14:47,540
Thank you everybody for your subs. Seriously

1760
04:14:49,000 --> 04:14:50,680
and dark soul, uh

1761
04:14:50,680 --> 04:14:54,040
I'm glad you don't use 70 hour work week. Take a nice needed rest take a couple days off

1762
04:14:55,370 --> 04:15:03,530
You deserve it for lydie 10 community subs. Thank you for lydie earlier about 30 minutes ago

1763
04:15:03,610 --> 04:15:06,010
I think I caught it but just want to say thank you again. It's a lot of money

1764
04:15:07,879 --> 04:15:11,879
Malto, thanks for the 500 bits. I have to say my favorite movie quote of all time is i'll be

1765
04:15:12,520 --> 04:15:14,680
Biac from the 1985 the germinator

1766
04:15:15,559 --> 04:15:19,079
It's not a bad one

1767
04:15:19,079 --> 04:15:20,860
Sorry

1768
04:15:20,860 --> 04:15:25,899
And then xion's w a s d. Thanks for the 500 bits. I'm gonna start a riot

1769
04:15:26,620 --> 04:15:30,219
Halo is not better or equal to tf2 xbox

1770
04:15:30,940 --> 04:15:33,100
Back me up against the pc oppressors

1771
04:15:36,440 --> 04:15:37,479
halo

1772
04:15:37,479 --> 04:15:38,920
What is this?

1773
04:15:41,989 --> 04:15:45,670
Halo is greater than and not equal to tf2's xbox

1774
04:15:46,469 --> 04:15:49,030
Well, all the console team fortresses were terrible

1775
04:15:50,020 --> 04:15:52,969
They never received an update

1776
04:15:53,129 --> 04:15:58,950
That's not fair

1777
04:15:58,950 --> 04:16:02,950
There were still glitches in the game where you could insta kill people with a melee attack in xbox

1778
04:16:03,510 --> 04:16:05,209
tf2

1779
04:16:05,209 --> 04:16:12,379
You could store a crit and just insta kill somebody and it was a incredibly simple to do

1780
04:16:16,229 --> 04:16:18,790
Uh, i'll be playing halo though. We'll see if it's any good on pc

1781
04:16:23,129 --> 04:16:26,329
All right, guys, see you tomorrow. Thanks for watching. I gotta get out here. I gotta eat at the store

1782
04:16:26,969 --> 04:16:28,729
Gotta get out of some food

1783
04:16:28,729 --> 04:16:32,409
Dusk is awesome. We'll keep playing tomorrow and see if we can beat it

1784
04:16:33,219 --> 04:16:34,739
Good night. Take care

1785
04:16:34,739 --> 04:17:24,149
See you tomorrow
