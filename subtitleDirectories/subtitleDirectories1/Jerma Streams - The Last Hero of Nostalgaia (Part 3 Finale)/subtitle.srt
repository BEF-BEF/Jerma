1
00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:33,979
How's it going? Yeah, I was gonna do it tomorrow. It's gonna be live tomorrow, but eh. It was on the

2
00:00:33,979 --> 00:00:40,140
brain. Just figured I'd finish it tonight. Probably not going to be a very long stream, but I'm into

3
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:45,659
this. I want to play it and I want to finish it. Reverse delay. Sometimes it happens. Well, it's

4
00:00:45,659 --> 00:00:55,049
actually been happening a lot more frequently. Yeah, it's supposed to be tomorrow, but yeah,

5
00:00:55,049 --> 00:01:05,780
whatever. Let's go. I imagine there's probably only another hour or two left in the game, so why not?

6
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:13,349
You got a Tom Hanks voice today? What? No, I don't. I do not. And whatever. I don't care.

7
00:01:53,989 --> 00:02:03,590
Well, I feel like I've lectured pre-stream chat about a bunch of random subjects.

8
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:21,740
I feel like I get in there sometimes and I just kind of write. I honestly, sometimes, I know. Okay,

9
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:25,979
here we go. Here comes the beast. Gonna break the magic. Sometimes when I'm in pre-stream chat,

10
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:30,939
I feel like I have the bugleberry mask on. You know what I mean? Like I just kind of, I can,

11
00:02:30,939 --> 00:02:36,569
it's just, I can just say anything. I don't know. Something about it. It's only like in pre-stream,

12
00:02:36,569 --> 00:02:39,930
but I just, oh, the grilled cheese hit the floor kind of stuff. Like I don't even like,

13
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:51,349
it's just whatever. Mask, mask, mask. I mean, sometimes I put the bugleberry mask on

14
00:02:51,990 --> 00:03:03,300
because, well, I, you know, I've, whatever. Santa isn't real. Okay. Sorry. It's been your

15
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:26,680
parents the whole time. Bro, what the fuck? Bugleberry is my parents? Take that back.

16
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:36,710
How can, how could I possibly say Santa isn't real when Santa was on my stream a couple months

17
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:57,539
ago? You guys can't be serious. Who was that then? Yeah. All right. Let's, let's get started.

18
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:12,120
500,000 bugs watching today. That's a lot. That's a huge viewership. Damn. Why are you like this?

19
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:18,439
I don't know. Cause I like having fun. It's really all I care about. Like the only thing I care about.

20
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:31,689
Sometimes I make my own fun. You know what I mean? You ever played brutal legends? No, but it looks

21
00:04:31,689 --> 00:04:49,459
fun. I always saw, I saw it kind of always on the shelf. Like, oh cool. I never really played it.

22
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:57,240
Seemed like a cool concept. Yeah. Let's, let's finish this. Like, I don't know. I'm not, there's

23
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:02,199
no time limit on this stream, but there's no time frame. It's just, I'm going to go until I beat it

24
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:16,810
and then we'll see. Finish Hollow Knight. Yeah, probably. Are you going to stream more than three

25
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:26,779
times this week? Um, well, technically this is the end of a week. It is currently Saturday evening.

26
00:05:28,069 --> 00:05:38,550
So I, the answer to that question I believe is no. So not this week. Sunday is the only,

27
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:43,079
I'm not streaming tomorrow. Instead of streaming this tomorrow, I'm streaming this today.

28
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:53,139
Just do four streams in a row. I mean, maybe I will at some point. It's in the middle of the

29
00:05:53,139 --> 00:06:03,110
night on Sunday. Well, yeah, it could be anywhere for anybody. How am I supposed to do any work

30
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:13,750
if you keep streaming you shithead? I don't know. Maybe just, maybe do the things you need to do.

31
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:25,560
Hey, I'm, I'm going to, I'm going to be here. Go do the things you need to do and then come

32
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:43,269
back when you're ready. Hey, that's not on me. It's not on me. All right, let's go. And the

33
00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:49,430
good thing about this time rather than last night is I know exactly where I am because we beat a

34
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:59,579
boss and I immediately stopped the stream. You don't get it. It's not that simple. You know,

35
00:07:02,139 --> 00:07:15,160
you kids, you kids don't understand. Back a long time ago, if there was a television show on TV

36
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:22,230
and you missed it, you didn't get to go back. You had to catch it when it was on or wait till

37
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:32,649
they released the fucking DVD like seven months later. You don't understand how easy you have it.

38
00:07:32,649 --> 00:07:44,019
All content is available. You have no idea. It's called a VCR. You could tape it, but what if you

39
00:07:44,019 --> 00:07:53,000
don't have a tape? What if you have like a box full of tapes and what if you ran out? What if

40
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,420
you're just like, I don't like, what if you don't feel like putting a tape in and hitting record?

41
00:07:58,339 --> 00:08:02,100
What if you missed it? What if you, I know like, oh, what? I'm just going to record

42
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:07,850
because I know it's going to be on at the tape could only record 60 to 90 minutes.

43
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:18,060
You couldn't go to work and record something. The tape was only like 60 minutes. Nice villain

44
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:32,649
monologue. You have no idea. The point of this initial monologue tell you, you can just watch

45
00:08:32,649 --> 00:08:40,950
the VOD. Although it's not ideal because you can't say, okay, yes. When I do something,

46
00:08:40,950 --> 00:09:05,740
I get it. I do. Uh, TLDR time that person out for five seconds. Let's go. All right. This is like

47
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:10,139
fucked. It is like a fucked up comment, but I have to read it because it's actually, it's just,

48
00:09:10,139 --> 00:09:15,269
I have to read it. They say, what do they say? It was, where is it? I want to get it right.

49
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:27,740
No, I need to be in sync with your breathing. All right, you know, time that person out for five

50
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:52,149
seconds too. That is a weird comment. All right. How come my controller doesn't work? Um, hello.

51
00:09:52,149 --> 00:10:00,570
How come I can't? There we go. All right. So the last thing we did. Yep. I beat that boss.

52
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:16,100
We got to the new area and I am precisely where I want to be lined up lined up perfectly with where

53
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:33,590
I want to go. Nice armor. Thanks. Oh my God. Okay. I didn't wait. Start over. There we go.

54
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:46,539
The audio was low for me. I, yeah, this, this, this is bloodborne. This is supposed to be bloodborne.

55
00:10:46,539 --> 00:10:57,139
This is great. Where's the beetle cam? Uh, I don't have the Beatles yet. Notice how I said yet.

56
00:10:57,139 --> 00:11:14,549
That decision has been locked in. Yeah. So for those that don't know, I, all right, I got, I,

57
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:18,309
it's so funny how your opinions and your life kind of changes and the way you see the world

58
00:11:18,309 --> 00:11:24,470
changes as you get a little older. I never thought I was going to care about bugs. Bugs, oh bugs,

59
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:31,379
who care? Like when I was younger, no, not even close. They kind of like fascinate me now. It's

60
00:11:31,379 --> 00:11:35,059
interesting. It's weird how it was like, oh yeah, I didn't care at all until like literally

61
00:11:35,059 --> 00:11:59,059
this last year, Jesus die. Okay. But anyways, the, I, I've talked about it a couple of weeks

62
00:11:59,059 --> 00:12:06,230
ago or so, whatever it was, but, uh, blue death feigning Beatles, they just look, they're so cool

63
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:15,289
looking and they're just so, it's just like silly. They're just silly little friends and they can

64
00:12:15,289 --> 00:12:19,669
live a very, very, very long time. They don't take a whole lot of maintenance and it seemed

65
00:12:19,669 --> 00:12:35,500
like kind of cool. Just like a thing to do. There's a, it's a fascinating world and sometimes I kind

66
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:49,159
of want to, I'd like to experience it, right? That's pretty much all there is to it. The Dead

67
00:12:49,159 --> 00:13:03,529
Space remake is Jesus Christ. Hold on. I'm dead. I'm dead. All right. These things are no joke.

68
00:13:03,529 --> 00:13:27,720
Jesus Christ is in Dead Space. Do you know what I keep laughing at? I, I need some opinions.

69
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:37,879
I need some chat opinions. So, uh, Wild Hearts last night. Um, the pig talking clip is just living

70
00:13:37,879 --> 00:13:47,210
in my head rent free. I just keep thinking about it. Something, I don't know why I thought it was

71
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:55,700
so funny, but, um, so part of that sponsor is, um, I'm going to be tweeting out a clip from the stream

72
00:13:55,700 --> 00:14:01,500
and they were just like, yeah, pick any, like any, like fun clip, doesn't matter. Like whatever it is,

73
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:08,120
as long as it's like fun or interesting. And I kind of want to use that. I think that that's,

74
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:21,429
I think that's fucking hilarious. Do you think that would, do you think that goes hard? I think

75
00:14:21,429 --> 00:14:37,350
it does. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Cause I was thinking about it. I was like, maybe it should be that

76
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:44,200
cause I don't know. Whatever. Oh my, okay. This is, these are the hardest enemies in the game.

77
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:55,480
I can't, I gotta, Jesus, I'm dead again. I lost 10,000 souls. Yeah. Or that, that falling. Yeah.

78
00:14:55,480 --> 00:15:00,840
So there's the other one when I have the hammer and I'm going down the zip line and I perfectly

79
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:05,960
time it. So I'm about to land just one, two, three, four, five, spinning with the hammer.

80
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:14,090
And I just land and die. And then Vinny dies right next to me. You can see, maybe people didn't pick

81
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:20,519
up on that. Or if you did, then you did. But Vinny literally at the end of that part falls right next

82
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:34,950
to me in the same spot and dies. Holy shit. Hold on. Oh my God. Uh, run a poll. I mean, there also

83
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:39,590
was a kind of a cool gameplay moment where I did the bulwark boom timed it perfectly and then did

84
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:49,539
a huge jumping slash. All right, let's get a poll. I'm curious. Uh, cool bulwark into jumping slash,

85
00:15:49,539 --> 00:15:57,779
the pig talks or falling with the hammer. I mean, there's no way the gameplay one's going to win,

86
00:15:57,779 --> 00:16:02,580
which, but I mean, we have to put it there. The pig is going to be 80%.

87
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:21,850
I don't know. The other one was, was pretty good too. You know what it is? These guys don't get

88
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:33,610
staggered when you hit them. Oh, these are unbearable. Could you do all three? Um,

89
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:58,710
pro probably. Can you show the clips? Um, I think it's, I think it's pretty much not even close.

90
00:16:58,710 --> 00:17:09,559
I don't think we need to do that. Judging by what this looks like so far. Looks like, uh, yeah,

91
00:17:09,559 --> 00:17:45,420
appreciate it. 83% damn pig sweep. All right. Don't lose here. Cause one comes from one runs behind

92
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:59,509
you. Oh jeez. Oh my goodness. Please do not. No, no, no, no. Oh, this area fucking hard.

93
00:17:59,509 --> 00:18:14,059
Okay. Both headphones are going in now. Both headphones going in. I wonder if I could,

94
00:18:14,059 --> 00:18:28,470
maybe it's better to parry this you think probably right with relentless enemies like this.

95
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:35,609
I think the play is always to try to parry like the first attack. This is a parry shield. Okay.

96
00:18:35,609 --> 00:18:45,190
This is a parry shield in the wrong hand, but it's better than all right. Here we go. Let's

97
00:18:45,190 --> 00:19:08,150
try it again. Let's see if it works. Christ. I'm dead. Well, it definitely got harder. Let me try

98
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:45,720
this again. Fuck. All right. You, I got it. I got it. I got it. It's hard to do that. It's actually

99
00:19:45,720 --> 00:20:10,519
very difficult. What about blocking? Ooh, that person's got the right idea. I'm going to be fat

100
00:20:10,519 --> 00:20:41,609
rolling, but it doesn't matter. That person's got it. Oh, oh my God. I hate these guys. Hey,

101
00:20:41,609 --> 00:20:46,569
VOD watchers skip 15 minutes. No, uh, uh, don't you don't know anything. What if that, what if

102
00:20:46,569 --> 00:20:50,890
it ends up being five minutes and that person listened to you and you were wrong? They're going

103
00:20:50,890 --> 00:21:10,740
to be very upset with you because they're about to, you know, 551 51 601 64. Okay. Six 14. If I

104
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:15,240
hope they did skip 15 minutes because it's six 14, there's going to be something really cool

105
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:36,630
that happens. I'm going to make sure of it exactly when it hits six 14 reusing this bit.

106
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:42,410
I loved this bit. I was just going to bring it up. You guys remember the Spongebob VOD treasure

107
00:21:42,490 --> 00:22:12,009
hunt. A lot of time went into that one. Jesus. I'm, I can't do it. I can't do it. I have a better

108
00:22:12,009 --> 00:22:43,079
idea. Eight endurance Andy. I got a better idea. Give me the shit I had already. Where is it?

109
00:22:43,079 --> 00:23:08,980
I have a new strategy. Oh my God. I tried to pick up the item that was probably going to be on the

110
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:23,380
ground and I just reset that. I think we're just going to get lucky with the crits. Just go all in,

111
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:56,309
go for it. Just go all in and hope that like my 30% crit rate works one at a time. I see you up

112
00:23:56,309 --> 00:24:04,980
there. I'm going to play that game. That's fine. Come on. Yeah. Yeah. What, what happened? What's

113
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:39,829
going on? I just don't want two. What the, oh my God. Shit. All right. I'm going to go in. It's

114
00:24:39,829 --> 00:25:03,819
three. Oh God. Okay. The other one disappeared. We lucked out. Nope. You're right there. Locked

115
00:25:03,819 --> 00:25:21,849
out. Bucked out on that one. Good. All right. Now you just got to tank it. Your character looks like

116
00:25:21,849 --> 00:25:26,630
you got dressed out of a dumpster behind a Halloween store the day after Halloween.

117
00:25:27,509 --> 00:25:43,940
That was a good one. That was a leather jacket. Okay. Everything's going good. Explore down here

118
00:25:43,940 --> 00:26:25,049
first. Should I go up? Maybe I think I can go backwards. Stop attacking for a second. So I'm

119
00:26:25,049 --> 00:26:52,140
going to attack you. Oh, it's just unfair. The devs knew what they were doing here too. It's just

120
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:55,740
one of them runs up from behind you and hits you like three times. The devs knew what they

121
00:26:55,740 --> 00:27:20,700
were doing here. I kind of want to go back though. Specifically for that, that reason right there.

122
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:27,829
First of all, that's a problem. And that person's already being annoying. It doesn't just annoy you.

123
00:27:27,829 --> 00:27:41,660
It annoys me. I'm going to jump down in a second. I want to go up this way. Can I go up this way?

124
00:27:41,660 --> 00:28:15,829
What? Are you going to do this? Oh, I can break it. Unburdened shield. What is that shield? Unburdened.

125
00:28:15,829 --> 00:28:36,200
Seventy five point six thousand sixty thousand and one. A weird number. A big number. Blood of a

126
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:40,940
forgotten NPC. I haven't used any of these. I really should. I feel like the game's like going

127
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:58,230
to end in an hour. I'd do this with everything though. It's all to drink and eat at the same

128
00:28:58,230 --> 00:29:05,480
time at the last boss. This is Resident Evil ruined an entire generation of gamers. It really

129
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:19,369
did. You know how many fucking red herbs I didn't eat? Yeah. You know how many magnum ammo I carried?

130
00:29:19,369 --> 00:29:27,140
40 hours of gameplay to shoot and miss 12 times at the last boss and maybe hit once. One of them.

131
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:39,220
We've got to stop doing that. And you know what? I'm going to be the thing that I'm. You know what?

132
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:47,109
Let's start now. I'm going to start now. You know what? Let's start now. Right? Increases item

133
00:29:47,109 --> 00:30:24,950
discovery. I'm using it. Let's go find something. Item hurry up. This thing's going to. I think it

134
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:54,440
died. Item actually worked. Do I have coins? I used 40 coins last night and I didn't keep them for the

135
00:30:54,440 --> 00:31:00,460
one part of the game that I needed to keep them for. You know don't ever use any of these. Don't

136
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:11,769
ever consume them. Don't ever. Always hold it to the very end. I just proved it because now there's

137
00:31:11,769 --> 00:31:34,359
a maze. Plus weapon degradation damage. That's pretty cool. Maybe I should do it. It's right handed

138
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:46,099
though. I'm a uh you know it's kind of weird. I'm a lefty in this game. I've never played an RPG or

139
00:31:46,099 --> 00:31:50,259
any like from software yet and I've never been a lefty. I'm actually a lefty this whole time.

140
00:31:50,259 --> 00:32:13,380
It's kind of cool. What about Zelda? Is Link? Link is left-handed in Breath of the Wild?

141
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:33,450
No right? Is he? Link is left-handed in most Zelda games. Oh in the Wii games he's uh

142
00:32:33,450 --> 00:32:47,079
ambidextrous but traditionally left-handed. Oh. Henceforth I shall not interfere. That was I

143
00:32:47,079 --> 00:32:53,099
don't know why that scared me. I actually have to apologize for that. There was like

144
00:32:53,099 --> 00:33:21,240
no reason to get scared by that. I'm gonna open my phone here bro.

145
00:33:22,359 --> 00:33:27,420
Bro I think I have the wrong address for the Halloween party. I'm fucking kind of freaking

146
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:50,170
out right now. Good thing I'm left-handed.

147
00:34:29,800 --> 00:35:05,539
Shut up. All right here in Anvil. No I was gonna just say something. I want to just.

148
00:35:06,659 --> 00:35:12,420
No I want to put my face into that and push the pins out. It's one of those toy things where you

149
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:17,719
push like your all the little pins they're like individual pins. You put your hand in it and it

150
00:35:17,719 --> 00:35:30,820
makes a mold of your hand. How many of you guys did that? How many people did the like put your

151
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:40,170
hand like you know that you put your face into it? This place was once a facade. We crafted

152
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:44,489
decorative theatrical torture devices for the great ritual. We didn't want to hurt each other

153
00:35:45,050 --> 00:35:51,369
That's a millennial thing. I'm sorry there's three of us talking right now. It's probably

154
00:35:51,369 --> 00:36:11,019
hard to pay attention. Yeah it was a little it was like a weird what was it like a what was

155
00:36:11,019 --> 00:36:21,559
that thing even called? It was a thing that it was a hundreds and hundreds of little little nails

156
00:36:21,559 --> 00:36:32,099
right? What was it called? It had a name. Pin thingy yeah. It wasn't nails. No it was like

157
00:36:32,099 --> 00:36:43,590
it was little pins. They weren't sharp or anything. It might not have even had a name.

158
00:36:46,280 --> 00:37:08,539
Look at this. I need four fragment of tradition. Everything has a name. Pin art toy apparently

159
00:37:08,539 --> 00:37:18,599
or it's a pin screen. Oh okay cool. Should I do damage or I keep complaining about stamina.

160
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:37,690
I don't think is that like a boomer thing? I feel like that's one of those toys that just

161
00:37:37,690 --> 00:37:58,940
never ends. It's a toy that is always available forever. All right let's go. Actually I have

162
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:21,769
enough. I feel like I'm talking during the movie but hold on. I can't attack. Oh you thought you

163
00:38:21,769 --> 00:38:41,239
were gonna get me? Nope. Actually wait a minute don't I oh no okay I thought I had one of those

164
00:38:41,239 --> 00:39:05,699
uh let's uh to get another charge of my flask thing. Fable of glitch? What is that?

165
00:39:11,719 --> 00:39:36,809
Oh it's for the it's for the smith source damage. Damn it. Oh fuck it's one of you. Nice.

166
00:39:38,010 --> 00:39:56,739
She talks more than you do. I'm I'm supposed to be talking. Complaining well not complaining

167
00:39:56,739 --> 00:40:01,059
but like addressing a streamer talking too much is like addressing the fact that your hamburger

168
00:40:01,059 --> 00:40:27,880
has a meat patty on it. I just wanted the bun. Less talking. What about a vegan burger?

169
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:44,340
The patty. The patty in the middle. It's a chicken costume. What is this a reference to?

170
00:40:45,059 --> 00:41:15,900
What is this? Hotline Miami? That is what it is isn't it? Yeah that's cool. How can it be

171
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:25,610
locked from both sides? I'm not going this way yet. It's called just unlock the door.

172
00:41:25,690 --> 00:41:52,280
This should just lock from both sides. Okay I'm gonna put a thing down here. No and this one

173
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:57,719
that says not this one and then down right here I'm gonna write this one.

174
00:42:08,170 --> 00:42:44,820
I gotta play it like Hotline Miami and why is this thing stuck and die a dozen times?

175
00:42:47,159 --> 00:42:56,039
Okay I remember Hotline Miami 2. That was when I think about the most angry I've been on stream

176
00:42:56,039 --> 00:43:05,690
on camera because let's be real like everybody knows right getting angry on stream I'm usually

177
00:43:05,690 --> 00:43:11,059
not I'm usually it's like oh whatever I'm like annoyed for a second or it's like oh frustrating

178
00:43:11,059 --> 00:43:25,079
for a second but I very rarely get actually upset truly upset on uh whoa holy shit oh my god

179
00:43:26,039 --> 00:43:34,949
that was unbelievably ridiculous that last five to ten minutes my heart is racing right now

180
00:43:34,949 --> 00:43:39,269
of how ridiculous that was guys wasn't that the most craziest fucking thing you've ever seen on

181
00:43:39,269 --> 00:43:50,539
stream and you're into ever that I've ever done holy shit whoa I'm speechless I mean I'm talking

182
00:43:50,539 --> 00:43:58,570
a lot but I'm speechless I really hope that nobody potentially skipped the last 15-ish minutes of the

183
00:43:58,570 --> 00:44:02,409
stream that would be so oh my you would have missed something I can't I don't even describe it

184
00:44:06,150 --> 00:44:21,239
I'm speechless right now I just got here oh oh oh but those who just got here uh 15 minutes

185
00:44:21,239 --> 00:44:27,000
ago somebody told somebody to skip 15 minutes so I wanted to make everybody that did that um and

186
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:50,420
listen to that person um question it you missed it what it was 25 minutes ago no it hasn't you

187
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:58,010
calculated it wrong but lul I appreciate it thank you I like the sympathy lul I appreciate it

188
00:45:24,489 --> 00:45:38,710
go don't fall down that all right I'm up here now oh

189
00:46:06,469 --> 00:46:44,280
oh you suck say something else say something funny he's being toxic

190
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:57,420
okay that's all I can do here let's drop down locked I think there was another thing to do

191
00:46:58,300 --> 00:47:15,800
this way blah blah blah blah yackety yackety yackety yackety blah blah blah blah

192
00:47:16,519 --> 00:47:31,909
okay so the only way to go is up that way just was checking to see if there's anything else to do

193
00:47:33,739 --> 00:48:14,780
and it does not so let's go she's done locked okay I gotta go up and around today I went here right

194
00:48:14,780 --> 00:48:35,079
yeah okay this is the only way to go I could go down that hole that's the only way to go so

195
00:48:35,079 --> 00:49:11,590
we're gonna drop down it's up one hit I must just turn the stream off after that that just

196
00:49:11,590 --> 00:49:20,300
fucked me up so bad like I was so pissed that I said that and it just that actually

197
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:40,820
fucked with my head fuck it's how I know where to go if I held it for a little longer

198
00:49:41,619 --> 00:49:51,699
I had a choice let me tell you what the choice was I don't want to lose 17 000 souls so hold on

199
00:49:53,619 --> 00:50:00,170
you have I made a choice the choice was hold it for a long time to make it actually make sense

200
00:50:01,210 --> 00:50:13,019
or stop it immediately and pretend hopefully nobody notices I chose probably not wisely

201
00:50:13,579 --> 00:50:21,079
get out of the way get out of the way

202
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:54,780

211
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:22,739
you're not making me do that you know any of these games I've played only the popular ones

212
00:56:22,739 --> 00:56:32,570
that are very agreeable to play Dark Souls 3 Bloodborne and Elden Ring and Dark Souls 1 I

213
00:56:32,570 --> 00:56:48,489
haven't done I haven't played any of the other ones I never played Dark Souls 2 Sekiro I played

214
00:56:48,489 --> 00:57:21,269
them all hey do you like things depends on what that thing is okay I got to play this right

215
00:57:21,989 --> 00:57:37,380
Dark Souls 2 is great but different yeah I mean I'm I played through the whole thing

216
00:57:37,380 --> 00:57:45,050
just didn't stream it yeah probably I'll be really honest with you guys you would not have

217
00:57:45,050 --> 00:57:52,070
wanted to watch that it's definitely at least three or four times at least no what am I talking

218
00:57:52,070 --> 00:57:57,909
about they're probably three or four hundred times during my just solo just sitting around

219
00:57:57,909 --> 00:58:11,480
playing Dark Souls 2 where I was insufferable I probably would have lost like 50,000 followers

220
00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:19,579
if you had actually watched me play Dark Souls 2 people would be like holy shit I don't I don't

221
00:58:19,579 --> 00:58:31,079
like this stream why what he's like he's he's being like he's saying awful things why why does

222
00:58:31,079 --> 00:58:39,670
he keep screaming fuck as loud as he can he needs to stop doing that can you imagine somebody just

223
00:58:39,670 --> 00:58:56,230
like fuck fuck I I did not do that I'm kidding that just hurts your voice I nobody would have

224
00:58:56,230 --> 00:59:05,699
wanted to watch that something amazing has spawned no new silly though you sure are swell when your

225
00:59:05,780 --> 00:59:15,219
cycle started an innocent uncorrupted NPC also appeared that hasn't happened for ages hey I

226
00:59:15,219 --> 00:59:23,059
have a fun idea how about you find them and bring them a little gift from me an innocent wouldn't

227
00:59:23,059 --> 00:59:30,340
be able to stay innocent long in this messed up world this guy's evil

228
00:59:30,980 --> 00:59:53,880
oh stop I see a lot of people saying to do that and I mean it's like I'm stop telling me to hit

229
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:57,960
the pink guy it's like it was funny at first but like mods actually start timing people up for it

230
01:00:00,010 --> 01:00:05,099
holy fuck oh that was the original title of the stream by the way I changed it last second

231
01:00:05,739 --> 01:00:36,900
I think that's an instant kill move whoa oh my goodness all right I'm gonna be honest I don't

232
01:00:36,900 --> 01:00:44,260
think you are real it's not personal but what is what is what is going on with that lately

233
01:00:44,260 --> 01:00:54,340
have you noticed that what is without what is with that what is what is up with that

234
01:00:54,340 --> 01:01:58,019

236
01:02:24,219 --> 01:02:34,010
like Galileo figured it out uh over this is the train tracks with the five people in the one

237
01:02:34,010 --> 01:02:53,960
person and I have to decide um no I only say hold on hold on hold on this is actually a

238
01:02:53,960 --> 01:03:04,010
fucking huge problem if I don't beat him thank god okay I feel like I've been seeing a lot of

239
01:03:04,010 --> 01:03:14,579
that lately like is he real thing it's like yeah bro I'm fucking real relax this is embarrassing

240
01:03:14,579 --> 01:03:23,940
oh shit I think I am to be civilized or some grim echo of that process whatever it involves

241
01:03:23,940 --> 01:03:29,059
I don't really care to find out and I don't suspect it'll work we've not spawned looking

242
01:03:29,059 --> 01:03:36,420
the way they want us to be rendered but for better or worse this is who I am no torture

243
01:03:36,420 --> 01:03:43,460
can change that it can only be torture please if you can find a way to mask what they hate to see

244
01:03:43,460 --> 01:03:57,179
of me before they tear me apart can I open the door why don't I just open the door can I open

245
01:03:57,179 --> 01:04:14,900
the door oh wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait very important you know usually when

246
01:04:14,900 --> 01:04:21,909
you pick decks decks is like the there's only like probably two or three just straight up

247
01:04:21,909 --> 01:04:27,960
dex weapons in this game I actually really like that I went into this dumping all my points into

248
01:04:27,960 --> 01:04:36,019
decks and luck but you could there's a lot of you could do like hybrid stuff that's like the whole

249
01:04:36,019 --> 01:05:03,289
point that's cool I like it what is this a reference to bloodborne vampire boss that's

250
01:05:03,289 --> 01:05:15,269
not bloodborne Castlevania that's probably more likely yeah Castlevania all right so nearly

251
01:05:15,269 --> 01:05:24,150
heroes were we and now a world needs us please find a way to cover what they hate of me

252
01:05:24,150 --> 01:05:45,929
convince them I'm the civilized adherent they seek nearly we can okay your kind once upheld

253
01:05:45,929 --> 01:05:54,409
all worth saving they ushered change to that worth changing it was not always their own wills

254
01:05:54,409 --> 01:06:19,219
they served oh heap of the stolen crown five of your relics come on nothing here

255
01:06:19,219 --> 01:06:33,719
oh this place is cool Dark Souls 2 scholar the first sin is the best from software game bar none

256
01:06:36,460 --> 01:06:42,980
it's hard to do that after Elden Ring comes out because you know I think Elden Ring it's hard

257
01:06:42,980 --> 01:06:48,199
to put that on the from software tier list because it's kind of every single from software

258
01:06:48,199 --> 01:06:54,739
game in the same game it's every single one of them together so it's kind of like a hard

259
01:06:54,739 --> 01:07:18,820
to put it somewhere friend have you found him have you found the king not yet oh wait I find

260

okay my heart is pounding my heart is pounding my heart is pounding my heart is pounding I did that

261
01:07:34,710 --> 01:07:41,699

262
01:07:41,699 --> 01:07:50,329
person is the real deal nobody moves like that I'd be like whoa all right I'm taking this person

263
01:07:50,329 --> 01:08:21,989
way more seriously now shortcut to where unlocked elsewhere come on really yes I'm gonna keep going

264
01:08:33,340 --> 01:08:51,800
oh no I'm gonna cheese this fight I don't want to die here help get me out here wait this is

265
01:08:51,800 --> 01:09:03,239

01:10:14,010 --> 01:10:47,449
cobbled leggings that defy the establishment is right one valiant hero they're not all blocked

269
01:10:47,449 --> 01:11:10,020
are they it's just a mess rooting voice potion Elden Ring is better than Bloodborne yeah but

270
01:11:10,020 --> 01:11:41,050
it's kind of it's in Elden Ring Bloodborne is in Elden Ring they are they are one that's a bad take

271
01:11:41,050 --> 01:11:50,649
I mean I don't think it is also this whole catalog spans like 15 years at this point

272
01:11:50,649 --> 01:11:58,380
and it's they're very similar games that's why I mean it's hard to do it because think about it

273
01:11:58,380 --> 01:12:04,729
think of like Super Mario Brothers and then they could look at Mario Odyssey it's like those are

274
01:12:04,729 --> 01:12:10,810
both really great for their own reasons but Mario Odyssey kind of is it's great but I mean but Super

275
01:12:10,810 --> 01:12:22,520
Mario Brothers is it's so good it's so classic it's hard to do that is Mario Odyssey objectively a

276
01:12:22,520 --> 01:12:29,720
better video game than Super Mario Brothers like what do you think the answer is like probably yes

277
01:12:29,720 --> 01:12:37,850
right but is it you it's hard to say that Super Mario oh what's the best Super Mario game well

278
01:12:37,850 --> 01:12:42,569
Super Mario Brothers of course the original it started at all the classic is it a better video

279
01:12:42,569 --> 01:12:47,720
game than Mario Odyssey that's that's you can't it's hard to do that you can't do that they're in the

280
01:12:47,720 --> 01:12:56,840
same the same franchise same developers well for the most part right or at least um somewhat

281
01:12:57,560 --> 01:13:18,810
Mario's been around for a little bit longer I just play games and like them that's a good take you

282
01:13:18,810 --> 01:13:52,489
know what that's a great take all right let's not mess this up not this gigachad I'm a gamer

283
01:13:52,489 --> 01:14:15,420
it's kind of cool that there's there's so many different genres of game they fill up so many

284
01:14:15,420 --> 01:14:24,300
different uh niches a lot Super Mario World is probably the best I would probably agree with that

285
01:14:24,300 --> 01:14:48,619
it's kind of sits right at that spot philosophy Andy yeah but whatever oh hold on a second I

286
01:14:48,619 --> 01:15:08,279
want to see this that's Street Fighter Metroid Zelda um I don't know who that is that's Peg

287
01:15:08,279 --> 01:15:25,460
Ganon Dr. Robotnik Diablo who's that up there Carmen Sandiego okay Carmen Sandiego the the

288
01:15:25,539 --> 01:15:46,970
Madman from Mega Man uh who's up top who is that Freddy no that's not that's not

289
01:15:46,970 --> 01:16:00,970
Freddy Krueger it's supposed to be Wario all right what about over here I think that's it

290
01:16:00,970 --> 01:16:30,680
this river of blood is interesting I don't know what that was hero Stumper chainsaw it's a dex

291
01:16:30,680 --> 01:16:50,090
weapon it's a pure dex weapon what this is not what I thought this was I thought it was just

292
01:16:50,090 --> 01:16:58,699
I thought it was a chainsaw it's a chainsaw on a stick I wasn't imagining it was going to be

293
01:16:58,699 --> 01:17:19,300
just a chainsaw it's a thrust weapon but I mean I don't have anything much better I'm going to

294
01:17:19,300 --> 01:17:39,270
upgrade this how is it with it in my offhand I actually kind of like it I don't know what that

295
01:17:39,270 --> 01:18:08,539
is but weird these things are not explode right whoa it's a comedy weapon it's one of the few

296
01:18:08,539 --> 01:18:25,750
pure dex scaling weapons I've found in the game so far so it's a it's a weapon for me who is that

297
01:18:45,939 --> 01:19:11,270
Bowser maybe it's supposed to be Bowser oh cool wait did I did I see in chat on the right straight

298
01:19:11,270 --> 01:20:19,670
ahead who is that I couldn't I didn't figure out who that was Eman Sephiroth Nostalgaia once loved

359
01:46:55,300 --> 01:47:26,140
pain in the ass okay you have a two swing pattern that was weird and you know it all right that was

360
01:47:26,140 --> 01:47:59,399
weird where did this guy come from i have to get this little shit out of here god damn it no don't

361
01:47:59,399 --> 01:48:48,920
deep ice yeah do you cast your magical bullshit god cast your magical bullshit no one cares

362
01:48:48,920 --> 01:49:16,250
you make the weirdest sounds a lot of air a lot of air comes out of my esophagus a lot of air

363
01:49:16,250 --> 01:49:30,180
just kind of shoots out it has nowhere to go okay how do i get over there i don't know how do i get

364
01:49:30,180 --> 01:50:43,220
over there shit i have to go down so if i pull that one will that do it i don't think i have very

365
01:50:43,220 --> 01:51:02,140
many souls anyways no i have to it's so stressful when you've got these lizard people casting these

366
01:51:02,140 --> 01:51:24,170
weird spells all right so go over here and then i think i did it wrong i know it's too many things

367
01:51:24,170 --> 01:52:04,970
to look at i don't know i feel like it's the other one does the i have to get up there and then

368
01:52:04,970 --> 01:52:29,500
oh they don't know what to do okay i haven't been here yet oh i don't want to fall off the

369
01:52:29,500 --> 01:53:01,079
fucking edge give me a safe spot don't love it i have to commit i have to commit i have to commit i

370
01:53:01,079 --> 01:53:31,140
have to commit that's why you commit i don't have any heals left uh my heart my heart hurts

371
01:53:31,140 --> 01:53:36,939
i'm not even up there either there's probably a dozen more enemies before i can get where i need

372
01:53:36,939 --> 01:54:43,319
to go this is not even correct i gotta get up there and then around the corner um that sucks

373
01:54:43,319 --> 01:54:55,460
i don't remember how to get up there oh i don't i don't is it all in the right spot still i'm so

374
01:54:55,460 --> 01:55:12,810
sad what am i having to the reduced agro range that other guy didn't even see me oh god oh that

375
01:55:12,810 --> 01:55:24,069
stinks i think i know where i'm going i see i have this issue when i'm under stress i'm not committing

376
01:55:24,069 --> 01:55:33,260
anything to memory so in my brain this is all just a blank canvas with enemies attacking me right my

377
01:55:33,260 --> 01:55:37,819
number one priority is not to remember what route to go it's don't die to the thing trying to kill

378
01:55:37,819 --> 01:55:58,659
you so it may as well just be a blank canvas i think it's lined up already though yeah i think

379
01:55:58,659 --> 01:56:15,670
so i think i'm all right and then through here and then this way get away from me okay thank god if

380
01:56:15,670 --> 01:56:43,500
it reset i'd be very sad okay we're good things are going fine i thought someone was behind me

381
01:56:43,500 --> 01:57:18,890
all right you two pieces of shit come on that thing is always like another second later a lot

382
01:57:18,890 --> 01:58:04,409
of a blood of a blood of blood all right pull it and then how do i do i have anything that connects

383
01:58:04,409 --> 01:58:13,560
to that one will this one move and go over there what happens if i pull it twice just go back to

384
01:58:13,560 --> 01:58:29,779
the original bro it's right there i don't want to make oh i didn't want to make any decisions till i

385
01:58:29,779 --> 01:59:36,090
got a good view don't rush my decision making there we go was there a lever did i just not see

386
01:59:36,090 --> 01:59:51,699
it this one there but i need to move this that way but i could only move this that way if i go

387
01:59:51,699 --> 01:59:55,880
that way over there to the left pull this one to turn it but i can't go that way unless i turn that

388
01:59:55,880 --> 02:00:16,199
one to go this way so just jump there's no jump in the game there's no jump i drop down i need to

389
02:00:16,199 --> 02:00:34,550
move that one can i get no i can't unless i drop down that's the one i need to pull so how do i

390
02:00:34,550 --> 02:00:43,189
get over there all right very clearly it wants to move this one to here but the only way i can

391
02:00:43,189 --> 02:01:26,489
physically do that is if hold on and turn it back he's so smart i always fucked that move up all

392
02:01:26,489 --> 02:02:02,390
right let's go finally here's the door line it up spin this shit around again so now i can just run

393
02:02:02,390 --> 02:02:16,760
up the stairs we're good this keep is rank with conviction and pride perhaps your patheticness

394
02:02:16,760 --> 02:02:22,489
preserves you from such folly but that was a compliment your deal why are you always here

395
02:02:24,310 --> 02:02:30,789
i told you to give my present to the innocent now he's been ruined by experiences thanks to you

396
02:02:30,789 --> 02:02:40,869
how can i trust you again after breaking my heart suck it up reservoir it's not my heart that

397
02:02:40,869 --> 02:02:47,270
matters evil the great one in this keep had swell intentions she wanted to remake the world like it

398
02:02:47,270 --> 02:02:53,670
used to be but reversion is still transformation it doesn't really matter that suffering can bring

399
02:02:53,670 --> 02:03:01,590
about change the problem is that change brings about suffering she made a boo-boo sound familiar

400
02:03:01,590 --> 02:03:33,060
if you want to heal the heart that actually matters unburden her i'd like a checkpoint

401
02:03:33,060 --> 02:04:02,859
can i jump out the window game stinks now we're in vampire land sure would be nice to have

402
02:04:02,859 --> 02:04:35,140
50 000 souls right now that'd be great i feel like we're getting into the end game i'm wondering

403
02:04:35,140 --> 02:04:58,060

406
02:05:21,699 --> 02:05:46,840
can't put it on the hotbar okay um there's this way there's that way this is shortcut at the bottom

407
02:05:46,840 --> 02:06:22,520
of the level i mean it has to be although this doesn't really make anything faster it's good to

408
02:06:22,520 --> 02:06:33,670
have it unlocked in case there's another one it's good to know i mean there's a bonfire right here

409
02:06:33,670 --> 02:07:32,220
anything to remember yep health boost on parry i that's a really neat feature i just want enough

410
02:07:32,220 --> 02:08:01,529
to go level up one more time that should do it yes because i don't want to lose 10 000 souls

411
02:08:01,529 --> 02:09:05,779
enemy is relentless what are my thoughts on the game so far i would classify this as a game that

412
02:09:05,779 --> 02:09:41,750
i'm gonna give it the term hidden gem very truthfully when he said it's like dark souls

413
02:09:41,750 --> 02:09:54,939
meets paper mario it's got a bunch of references and you know what else too it's a game that's

414
02:09:54,939 --> 02:10:01,420
baked around a kind of comedy but all the comedy and all the humor and all the joke stuff

415
02:10:01,899 --> 02:10:11,989
has been it hasn't been really heavy-handed or anything it's been very enjoyable so very charming

416
02:10:11,989 --> 02:10:19,500
bundle of sticks had the king ever closer with each pixelated step was it truly happening

417
02:10:19,500 --> 02:10:41,880
if they'd listen to this lady again

418
02:10:56,340 --> 02:11:07,220

419
02:11:07,779 --> 02:11:13,779
rocked by your desire this is peach run home

420
02:11:26,710 --> 02:11:27,750
strength

421
02:11:44,470 --> 02:11:54,340

436
02:19:53,879 --> 02:20:08,059

437
02:20:08,059 --> 02:20:17,020
that everybody kind of believed did it actually do anything something about the the crystals

438
02:20:17,899 --> 02:20:30,940
in the toothpaste right something weird bro i'm just telling you like it was i'm just telling you

439
02:20:30,940 --> 02:20:46,860
that's what i that's what people thought why did people think that anybody have like an actual

440
02:20:46,860 --> 02:21:21,670
answer it was just wild speculation it worked on minor scratches it was a light abrasive

441
02:21:23,450 --> 02:21:26,090
that could smooth out the surface so it wasn't total bullshit then

442
02:21:26,729 --> 02:22:03,020
gosh tell gaya why is this weird right hold on humility

443
02:22:14,040 --> 02:22:15,159
purify or release

444
02:22:23,930 --> 02:22:29,639
faith are we releasing or we're purifying

445
02:22:29,959 --> 02:22:36,010

447
02:22:47,590 --> 02:23:40,680

448
02:23:40,760 --> 02:23:51,659
to hear the whole thing i'm in faith right

449
02:24:03,270 --> 02:24:13,899
release she said right she said right but i have to listen to chat here

450
02:24:15,000 --> 02:24:27,639
she said you do not think that right exceeds your instincts fidelity is next to the all

451
02:24:27,639 --> 02:24:42,620
sorry chat you picked the wrong one oops yeah there are a lot of spells in the game

452
02:24:43,180 --> 02:25:17,209
that's a cool little easter egg oh shit wait isn't isn't humility down here okay

453
02:25:17,209 --> 02:25:43,670
wait wait wait say it again what do i need to do okay lose the ego humble myself

454
02:25:51,459 --> 02:26:01,340
okay step on the button all right i have to step on the button humble yourself

455
02:26:01,340 --> 02:26:17,270
oh

456
02:26:44,040 --> 02:26:56,950
i don't know is it a certain outfit where did this person come from

457
02:27:08,739 --> 02:27:20,729
come fight me over on come fight me over on the button and see what happens

458
02:27:37,110 --> 02:27:58,659
i've never dodged that move i mean this is kind of the opposite of humility i took all of my gear

459
02:27:58,659 --> 02:28:06,899
off and bm'd that person i don't think i'll be able to do this i was so prideful that i was

460
02:28:06,899 --> 02:28:35,989
proving that i could kill that person with no gear i think i blew it wait a minute whoa seven

461
02:28:35,989 --> 02:29:06,459
thousand bucks i can put the whole set on now that's cool how it actually turns it into like a 3d

462
02:29:06,459 --> 02:30:10,620
model i don't get it sit there for more than 10 seconds just wait there it is let's go there's

463
02:30:10,620 --> 02:30:45,110
a huge ass tower perfect fit it's a big heavy thing it's like a roof minecraft tetris

464
02:30:55,690 --> 02:30:58,809
okay

465
02:31:05,850 --> 02:31:23,610
i think i've done all the towers still the ones that i know i can do

466
02:31:24,250 --> 02:31:36,540
you know what games would you say the best at oh if i'm being honest it's probably games where

467
02:31:36,540 --> 02:31:58,040
you have to press a button very fast clicker games name one game where that's important

468
02:31:58,040 --> 02:32:08,620
name one game okay i'll tell you i'll tell you you little bastards

469
02:32:13,739 --> 02:32:24,579
in metal gear solid there is a part where you have to press circle as fast as you can

470
02:32:24,579 --> 02:32:31,319
to withstand torture i was always the guy in the room when friends of mine would play this

471
02:32:32,899 --> 02:32:43,610
just hand the controller to jeremy it gets so hard it gets almost impossible but if you do it

472
02:32:43,610 --> 02:32:49,110
and you do it the whole time and you actually don't you actually withstand it it unlocks

473
02:32:49,670 --> 02:32:54,860
an omega item at the end of the game they used to hand the controller to me

474
02:33:04,840 --> 02:33:14,600
you little bastards i'm sorry i thought it would be funny am i sorry let's go

475
02:33:22,540 --> 02:33:25,739
now you know what yeah not not sorry

476
02:33:29,500 --> 02:34:08,059
oh it's bold coming from somebody that's five eight you've seen me sprint i'm fast i bet i'm

477
02:34:08,059 --> 02:34:21,770
faster than you now i can only do this for about one and a half full seconds before i have to sit

478
02:34:21,770 --> 02:34:43,909
down for an hour but you better believe i've i've been running faster than you faster than a speeding

479
02:34:43,909 --> 02:34:47,590
bullet yeah i would actually be a really bad superhero now that i sit here and think about

480
02:34:47,590 --> 02:34:57,370
this even if i had powers i would run out of gas in in fucking 10 minutes i would be like

481
02:34:58,969 --> 02:35:03,989
punch punch kick kick kick slide kick and i would take out one person and just sit down

482
02:35:03,989 --> 02:35:13,139
and on the on a bench and just breathe heavy for like two hours just save me for the final boss

483
02:35:13,139 --> 02:35:19,059
you know what i mean like you all right you can just relax for the entire time that like thanos

484
02:35:19,059 --> 02:35:26,100
is attacking us but at the very end we're just gonna give you like an espresso and a bag of

485
02:35:26,100 --> 02:35:35,159
Doritos and just all right he thanos is in that room we've got him cornered jerma get in there

486
02:35:35,159 --> 02:35:48,579
and that would fuck him up so we have no idea and that's it that's all i would be able to do

487
02:35:52,409 --> 02:35:55,930
and i would have to tell it be like hey hey hey wait before i get in there can you wear him down

488
02:35:55,930 --> 02:36:00,889
so in 10 minutes i'll be able to kill him and they'll do their whole thing you know everyone

489
02:36:00,889 --> 02:36:06,569
will fight of and it'll be epic and then everyone will be like defeated and it'll just be me in my

490
02:36:06,569 --> 02:36:25,909
fucking underwear with like with like a fucking club and then he just like obliterates me in one

491
02:36:25,909 --> 02:37:06,219
second oh this is a shortcut 30 000 souls you're 40 not 90 you could definitely do a roundhouse kick

492
02:37:06,219 --> 02:37:13,100
yeah i would just queue up a huge roundhouse kick and just it would be really really shitty

493
02:37:13,100 --> 02:37:18,459
my leg would only come up about a foot and a half but i would i would kick him with such force in

494
02:37:18,459 --> 02:37:25,190
the stomach just make some insta puke and and then i pull like my i would tear some like two

495
02:37:25,190 --> 02:37:58,899
or three muscles in my leg like superman kind of comes in and just laser eyes him why is superman

496
02:37:58,899 --> 02:38:06,379
in marvel well we're talking about a multi-franchise level threat which who knows

497
02:38:07,420 --> 02:38:13,530
you know like let's be honest for a minute here i feel like marvel's going so far into this like

498
02:38:13,530 --> 02:38:20,309
phase five phase six phase seven at some point i'm expecting a like gordon ramsay style fucking

499
02:38:20,309 --> 02:38:27,239
cooking show in phase seven like wolverine is one of the judges ad i don't know like captain marvel

500
02:38:27,879 --> 02:38:34,569
and like fucking cyclops are competing and shit i feel like we're going there i like phase eight

501
02:38:34,569 --> 02:38:55,930
i don't know what to do germa you seem like the type of guy to bring a lunchbox to a superhero

502
02:38:55,930 --> 02:39:10,860
fight you know okay what about the magic rock that's in that lunchbox that has the power of

503
02:39:10,860 --> 02:39:35,340
50 grenades i can say about that that's not powerful against like thanos but then i would

504
02:39:35,340 --> 02:39:43,079
just distract him i would do the super funny comic relief thing where i would just be behind

505
02:39:43,079 --> 02:39:51,129
Thanos and be like oh Thanos look over here and he'd be like oh what's that little worm

506
02:39:52,569 --> 02:40:11,420
insect and i distract him long enough for somebody to hurt him he's the character everybody hates one

507
02:40:11,420 --> 02:40:17,350
all right somebody said this one day and it was it was pretty funny you know sometimes you have

508
02:40:17,350 --> 02:40:23,110
to have a little bit of humility right somebody said one day i don't know i by the way i don't

509
02:40:23,110 --> 02:40:26,709
agree with this person but it was funny and sometimes you know whatever it's like if you're

510
02:40:26,709 --> 02:40:33,690
making a joke whatever somebody said that this stream was a marvel movie with all the quips and

511
02:40:33,690 --> 02:40:40,889
none of the fighting it was just like germa your stream is the worst kind of marvel movie it's just

512
02:40:40,889 --> 02:40:53,780
only jokes and there's no action or anything it's just like quips i disagree i disagree with it

513
02:40:53,780 --> 02:41:33,829
wait which one goes up this one it's wrong but it's funny oops oh no no that was you that got

514
02:41:33,829 --> 02:41:53,610
hurt not me i would just freak Thanos out to a point you know what i mean like everyone always

515
02:41:53,610 --> 02:42:02,170
expects like we're gonna fight maybe it just wouldn't even fight him we're just like one

516
02:42:02,250 --> 02:42:13,129
i would be like i want to join you Thanos i will join you it doesn't he like when people do that

517
02:42:13,129 --> 02:42:16,809
yeah and then and then like i don't know during one of the biggest battles there's like 10 people

518
02:42:16,809 --> 02:42:21,620
and i'm there and i have access to like the pa system i was gonna fart into the pa microphone

519
02:42:21,620 --> 02:42:25,899
and just fuck the whole thing up it's gonna be what the fuck was that what the hell's going on

520
02:42:25,899 --> 02:42:55,239
and then the confusion they'll be able to get him oh my god that is so unfunny is that what he said

521
02:43:02,889 --> 02:43:22,139
okay i need to cleared pretty much everything Loki tried that germa and look at him now i didn't

522
02:43:22,139 --> 02:43:57,319
see and watch Loki wait Loki in the Loki series farts over the pa what no i go from here literally

523
02:43:57,319 --> 02:44:43,129

524
02:44:43,129 --> 02:44:53,110
called out by my girlfriend here she said you would never publicly fart and you know what that's true

525
02:44:53,110 --> 02:44:59,829
i would have the opportunity to do that to distract Thanos and i would be like i can't

526
02:45:00,309 --> 02:45:15,540
it's gross no it's gross and that was what yeah i wouldn't be able to do it no don't open all the

because i don't this person's really annoying dude unplug the steering wheel and use a normal

596
03:13:01,510 --> 03:13:38,969
controller that'd be so hard all right only one enemy left we did it all right what's in here

597
03:13:38,969 --> 03:13:57,450
ruined lifting barbell probably strength equipment load hmm i think i'm gonna put that on at 58 what

599
03:14:51,670 --> 03:16:02,219

600
03:16:02,219 --> 03:16:51,079
pretty nifty mario mario mario i don't think that was worth 10 000 souls but i only have two heels

601
03:16:51,079 --> 03:17:00,629
left um just do this again wait is there anything else here that i didn't do before i leave to

602
03:17:00,629 --> 03:17:48,379
refresh so that's to go down i think i'm all right but i'll level up a couple more times and then

603
03:17:48,379 --> 03:18:47,540
it's gonna be a lot i think all right how we doing cool let's try it again please listen to us the

604
03:18:47,540 --> 03:19:11,579
bonfire at the top of the lift here but we only you're gonna have to only listen to the music one

more time because i'm gonna kill the boss right now can can we bet um yeah i mean if the mod wants

606
03:19:39,750 --> 03:20:15,829

610
03:21:57,430 --> 03:22:41,590
she's hitting me two times and i die how could you do this to me oh no that person's sad i know

611
03:22:41,590 --> 03:22:50,280
that this is gonna give me crits crit damage up and off hand but i wonder if it's worth just

612
03:22:50,280 --> 03:22:58,139
two-handing it i don't know i tried to do the thing in these games where you press the button

613
03:22:58,139 --> 03:23:33,700
and leave but you can't you cannot do that maybe parry's would not vote yes on this i don't know

614
03:23:33,700 --> 03:23:48,629
who's up to you do what you want with your points who knows she does that move when she

615
03:23:48,629 --> 03:23:51,829
cues up and then dives forward slash i might be able to get it pretty perfectly

616
03:23:51,829 --> 03:24:05,000
somebody said get this elevator i don't know where to go for it i feel like i've explored

648
03:37:13,670 --> 03:37:21,909
his purpose so he prevents the next chapter of your story from unfolding you must confront him

649
03:37:21,909 --> 03:37:29,420
final boss grief as before has whisked him away to the start of sequence a place where meaning was

650
03:37:29,420 --> 03:37:40,280
once conveyed it long ago became inaccessible to heroes we must find you a way inside perhaps

651
03:37:40,280 --> 03:37:55,209
a way which your kind was never meant to see meet me below this husk of a keeper memory of a monarch

652
03:37:55,209 --> 03:38:02,649
it's a little one that's tiny return to the edge of the wild you shall pry open the narrator's mouth

and do the best they can to make sure that i can get there in a timely manner i'm just gonna walk

666
03:42:08,489 --> 03:42:19,479
such as your nature yet you never succeed my success was never measured by the outskirts

667
03:42:19,479 --> 03:42:27,399
seemed to want perhaps yours is not measured by your class and the kings such as i thought

668
03:42:28,280 --> 03:42:38,459
the success of a father is measured by that of their progeny um yeah it's the bug viewers and

669
03:42:38,459 --> 03:42:42,780
i got a huge huge bug audience they're super cool too they're always like super supportive and

670
03:42:42,780 --> 03:42:54,809
awesome it's really cool i was thinking about uh changing the stream to be like bugs only like

671
03:42:54,809 --> 03:43:02,440
no humans anymore how's it gonna be like a bug streamer it is done then the fanatics reign of

672
03:43:02,440 --> 03:43:11,190
order has finally passed but the crown long repressed is now only ash forgive me but what

673
03:43:11,190 --> 03:43:15,989
is a kingdom with no king what should be saved if there's no station to keep it safe when its

674
03:43:16,069 --> 03:43:23,219
saviors inevitably pass here take this the heirloom too has been forgotten

675
03:43:23,219 --> 03:43:31,079
nostalgaia has no need of it now good tradition died with the good king good tradition died

676
03:43:31,079 --> 03:44:07,299
what is it strength wonderful point maker i have a final decision to make of what i'm gonna upgrade

677
03:44:07,299 --> 03:44:22,500
but this is kind of cool what's the scaling everything wait i can remember this throughout

678
03:44:23,059 --> 03:44:37,030
places never meant for of these corals leads to the npc city respite those facilitating the great

679
03:44:37,030 --> 03:44:45,670
ritual cast off their costumes and simply be but it has changed to reach the narrator

680
03:44:46,309 --> 03:44:54,870
venture through the npc city and into nostalgaia's forsaken tutorial find a staging room entrance

681
03:44:54,870 --> 03:45:05,049
beneath the wiles and meet me within okay i was in a lot of those earlier meet me within okay so

03:47:21,270 --> 03:48:03,139
all right here it is okay so this is where i need to be npc city npc city i explored down

688
03:48:03,139 --> 03:48:14,489
here a lot so i'm actually kind of glad i knew where this was hello ah this is where i couldn't

689
03:48:14,489 --> 03:48:32,260
go before but you were drawn from some forgotten time and space the memory of you does not fit

690
03:48:32,260 --> 03:48:38,819
and that too gives you power fear not the shallowness from whence you came for its

691
03:48:38,819 --> 03:48:48,860
meaning is multi-dimensional embrace the depth of what you are some areas have collapsed into

692
03:48:48,860 --> 03:48:53,420
a one-dimensional surface you can traverse these areas by harnessing your inner flatness

693
03:48:53,420 --> 03:49:13,770
approach this wall and think flat thoughts new ability flat counter when you see this

694
03:49:13,770 --> 03:49:34,760
above an enemy stand still and press b i've seen that before in pc city so can i do it

695
03:49:34,760 --> 03:50:00,940
from the strings with which he finds you you seek to confront the power of story

696
03:50:00,940 --> 03:50:41,620
leave me to my misery oh okay is that you whoa this is weird what's this

697
03:50:48,500 --> 03:50:58,069
hall of heroes wait this is this is the yeah this is the tutorial okay so this is back in the very

698
03:50:58,069 --> 03:51:18,069
beginning of the game set it here can't really level up or anything but i keep going dude isn't

699
03:51:18,069 --> 03:51:24,870
that so crazy in the tutorial this door was the end game imagine being able to walk through there

700
03:51:24,870 --> 03:51:33,979
this is the last part this is the end game final boss through here it's so insane i actually do

701
03:51:33,979 --> 03:51:40,219
think that's i like it's i like that actually interesting to me like you're so close but so far

702
03:51:40,219 --> 03:51:45,610
i like it if you don't like it get out of here all right what are you doing here

703
03:51:51,510 --> 03:52:55,989
here nice the memory saber strength god damn it yeah you unlock it here tail of luck why did you

704
03:52:55,989 --> 03:53:04,569
have to do decks because in the first three or four hours of the game i found a cool weapon that

705
03:53:04,569 --> 03:53:13,510
scaled off of decks and off of luck i know you're probably saying that's not true but it is because

706
03:53:13,510 --> 03:53:21,030
luck gets me more crit more crit damage in my offhand the scales with dexterity therefore it's

707
03:53:21,030 --> 03:53:43,770
perfect for the class that i'm playing right now i mean this is kind of rude modified cane of what

708
03:53:43,770 --> 03:53:55,659
was it modified cane of helpfulness there's so many cool strength weapons it's just an axe

709
03:53:56,379 --> 03:54:18,059
i feel like this thing is pretty good for being in the other hand and i committed to dual welding

710
03:54:18,059 --> 03:54:49,459
as well that's why bloodborne oh right wait i just hit let me try that jesus dude wait what

711
03:54:49,459 --> 03:55:09,700
what just happened i am so confused right now did that like stun him all right you gotta dodge

712
03:55:09,700 --> 03:55:22,700
through that not to the left or to the right oh there it is of course you're gonna let me

713
03:55:22,700 --> 03:55:32,700
have that item too but um it's gonna be strength strength decks can't put it on and remember it

714
03:55:32,700 --> 03:55:59,059
though it's a lot but whatever freeze damage to abominations yeah cool it looks like a most

715
03:55:59,059 --> 03:56:07,340
all right so it seems like a huge amount of items scale with strength decks deck source nothing

716
03:56:07,340 --> 03:56:15,860
really scales with luck so i mean the crit thing is luck but there's no weapon that it does this

717
03:56:15,860 --> 03:56:24,629
luck is not a stat that and you know what i don't want to talk to you but i will if you want to

718
03:56:24,629 --> 03:56:41,899
heal the heart that actually matters unburden her maybe i should do this to something or is

719
03:56:41,899 --> 03:56:57,049
this a bad end or something i i unburden something and i get the bad end i'm not doing it nobody

720
03:56:57,049 --> 03:57:26,780
likes you that was mean i only said that because i look over a chat and i see everybody say leave

721
03:57:26,780 --> 03:57:45,940
don't talk to him don't leave don't even look at that guy i just heard a uh huh where is it

722
03:57:45,940 --> 03:58:22,680
what is the i thought it was a shadow i thought it was a shadow on the ground i didn't think it

723
03:58:22,680 --> 03:59:13,030
was a bunch of holes i thought it was a shadow the hall of junior hero jeez not this again i

724
03:59:13,030 --> 04:00:14,790
didn't read all right we're good left-handed all right cool good show what happened there

725
04:00:14,790 --> 04:01:03,659
can you please do your chickadee d d noise no no all right no i don't want him this upset all

726
04:01:03,659 --> 04:01:50,459
right let's do it again away away are you great killing right it's all your fault comes for me so

727
04:01:50,459 --> 04:02:04,889
i thought it was you grave stealing rat you grave stealing rat and that's what i actually thought

728
04:02:04,889 --> 04:02:36,250
it was can we just do the other part of the combo you're really making all of us mad you're just

729
04:02:36,250 --> 04:03:06,200
making everybody mad now let's try this again this time i will be aware of that and you have not

730
04:03:06,200 --> 04:03:25,340
aggroed yet so let me just cheese this i think that's cheese enough you too you still hit me

731
04:03:25,340 --> 04:03:41,139
okay that's the i have a lot of points in decks that thing is actually saving me a lot of time

732
04:03:41,139 --> 04:04:14,969
that's the one great reason to use decks that item and i feel like i still don't understand

733
04:04:14,969 --> 04:04:35,590
how that thing works easy maker key drake saber oh remember i asked how to get up here wait a

734
04:04:35,590 --> 04:05:35,579
minute oh my god this is very girl scout cookie um i like the mint ones ladder here too i'm not

735
04:05:35,579 --> 04:06:14,620
supposed to even be here all right what was this for silver of tradition oh no hold on that is that

736
04:06:14,620 --> 04:06:34,250
all that's here i think i've i've i've been here now yeah i've been here before yeah i've done this

737
04:06:34,250 --> 04:07:13,260
already well that's cool that it wraps all the way around but how do i like this please play a link

738
04:07:13,260 --> 04:07:20,739
between worlds right now you're gonna have to wait at least a week so you're gonna have to wait at

739
04:07:20,739 --> 04:07:32,709
least a week and up to um a couple of years at least there's a range in there somewhere

740
04:07:32,709 --> 04:07:44,940
and halfway through that range i might just not feel like playing it so i probably won't play it

741
04:07:44,940 --> 04:08:52,940
oh i said come on this thing seems so cool reminds me of banjo kazooie talking holy

742
04:08:52,940 --> 04:09:02,250
you should play kerbal space program dude is this a fake memory or did i play kerbal space program

743
04:09:02,250 --> 04:09:11,079
one for like 30 40 minutes and i just couldn't comprehend it couldn't do it i couldn't stand it

744
04:09:11,079 --> 04:09:19,579
and i was like guys i'm sorry i can't play this game that happened didn't it i remember yeah no

745
04:09:19,579 --> 04:09:30,360
it really did i think i did not on stream is this is this has to be a real memory maybe i like

746
04:09:30,360 --> 04:09:34,120
was gonna make a video on it and i was just like 30 minutes in i was like no fucking away

747
04:09:34,120 --> 04:09:44,579
i never streamed it maybe i was gonna make a video on it that's probably what it is maybe when it was

748
04:09:44,579 --> 04:09:49,700
it was really really kind of popular back in the old youtube days that sounds more accurate yeah

749
04:09:49,700 --> 04:10:14,969
well that's what happened well jerma will please play animal crossing again i want to see your

750
04:10:14,969 --> 04:10:19,690
island dude i'm gonna go back to that island it's gonna be a bunch of fucking skeletons

751
04:10:22,090 --> 04:10:32,440
i i haven't played animal crossing in like a year and a half that would be depressing i don't want

752
04:10:32,440 --> 04:11:01,020
to do that i have to start a new land or something this is such a cool feature udder annihilator

753
04:11:01,020 --> 04:11:12,600
it's gonna be a strength weapon you don't come on damn it all right i probably don't have enough

754
04:11:12,600 --> 04:11:44,229
to remember it whoa this thing is kind of amazing 100 of almost everything i can't remember it um

755
04:11:44,229 --> 04:11:52,600
but hold on increased damage for remembered weapons very stamina regen speed is at 20

756
04:11:53,719 --> 04:11:59,780
i need one i need to remember one more thing i think i can get there yeah i can definitely

757
04:11:59,780 --> 04:12:46,389
get there yeah let's do it secret cow level oh my god diablo 2 so now increased stamina regen

758
04:12:46,389 --> 04:13:12,979
speed that's huge you'd like actually go down that way but no diablo didn't diablo going into

759
04:13:12,979 --> 04:13:18,440
like a beta or something in a month i've not paid very much attention to that game i've been

760
04:13:19,000 --> 04:13:26,870
i've just been so i don't even want to know is anybody is it good has anybody tried it at

761
04:13:26,870 --> 04:13:37,129
any of the times they've a lot of people to play it yeah i have not paid attention to pretty much

762
04:13:37,129 --> 04:13:45,479
anything blizzard in god it's been since probably overwatch one maybe hearthstone a little bit but

763
04:13:45,479 --> 04:14:35,270
not really not really i go from here flat there but yeah i go down there most of like wow wow

764
04:14:35,270 --> 04:14:53,940
classic um i gave it a look i'll be honest but i mean just not into it anymore like at all these

765
04:14:53,940 --> 04:15:20,250
are red i'm drinking this holy shit that's bad overwatch 2 is decent i've heard that it's i've

766
04:15:20,250 --> 04:15:28,020
heard it's pretty good i just have no interest the only thing that would really want me to play a

767
04:15:28,020 --> 04:15:37,590
blizzard game is if the uh like if diablo 4 is holy shit bro bro you have no idea diablo 4 is

768
04:15:37,590 --> 04:15:41,909
you have no idea and then i'd be like holy shit i don't have i have no idea apparently and i'm

769
04:15:41,909 --> 04:16:30,059
maybe that's right that's probably what it would take no bro you have no idea that's so bad that's

770
04:16:30,059 --> 04:16:40,260
a run ruiner right there where you going we're going run ruiner i'm not gonna let you do that

771
04:16:40,260 --> 04:17:02,709
i think that's the other side of the sewer thing that i was looking at in the very beginning of

772
04:17:02,709 --> 04:18:02,059
the game who even is hitting who here any memories satisfying noise finally the smith where are you

773
04:18:02,059 --> 04:18:33,909
finally the smith where are you oh thank goodness last time i'll probably see your face this anvil

774
04:18:33,909 --> 04:18:38,870
must have been brought here from one of the npc's workshops we used to retreat to our staging rooms

775
04:18:38,870 --> 04:18:43,670
to recuperate and to repair our battered costumes but these ain't costumes being forged here

776
04:18:44,469 --> 04:18:54,170
this anvil has been pounded with hatred we use it out of love tradition is more than any instance

777
04:18:54,170 --> 04:19:06,700
of its work the full power of the smith's hammer is restored we serve you always hero cool well it

778
04:19:06,700 --> 04:19:09,899
this thing i'm gonna i'm gonna max this out because it's obviously for the build

779
04:19:14,819 --> 04:19:25,530
i need one more of these to get it maxed but also do i want to upgrade something

780
04:19:27,100 --> 04:19:37,500
the hammer serves that i feel like i need to do something i could just put the default dagger up

781
04:19:37,500 --> 04:19:42,059
actually no it's this one although it's not remembered i feel like it's not worth it

782
04:19:42,700 --> 04:20:00,649
i could put a point i could put one point two points in strength and one point in

783
04:20:00,729 --> 04:20:22,780
source and be able to put this on but it's not remembered probably this the key is kind of cool

784
04:20:26,149 --> 04:20:53,430
i have it memory unlocked dex 1.1 i probably would have done this one two point wait a minute

785
04:20:53,430 --> 04:21:07,370
excuse me this thing is a dex weapon loot heroes loot i need to get this remembered where do i go

786
04:21:07,370 --> 04:21:25,379
festivity row maybe that might maybe that's the other hand this one's 2.3 i had options here

787
04:21:25,379 --> 04:21:41,030
gilded axe or loot heroes loot two point uh i mean this is 2.2 scaling i have it remembered

788
04:21:41,030 --> 04:21:58,860
i feel like i could just beef this up like crazy this also uh this is kind of ugly this is a

789
04:21:58,860 --> 04:22:19,049
two-hander this is unburdened but kind of cool i think it's i'm gonna go loot oh it's an axe

790
04:22:19,049 --> 04:22:32,090
that's funny i mean if it scales this well off of decks then why not it's a guitar hero controller

791
04:22:32,090 --> 04:22:56,969
let's level it up why not i definitely want this to be maxed out because that's the best

792
04:22:56,969 --> 04:23:12,149
weapon i have for my character all right so where is it let's do it tradition right wait what do i

793
04:23:12,149 --> 04:23:23,860
need piece of tradition so this is fragment of tradition fragment of tradition piece of

794
04:23:23,860 --> 04:23:37,620
tradition 120 193 now what is it now 112 183 121 272 pretty good it's not even remembered yet

795
04:23:37,620 --> 04:23:49,020
hammer serves the hero always so i have to go back to that kind of loot dungeon i really i'm not sure

796
04:23:49,020 --> 04:24:00,260
where that is maybe it's right here that would be so cool if it was but hold on where does this go

797
04:24:00,819 --> 04:24:41,750
repurposed cane of support the combo with these two together is way way better strengthen decks

798
04:24:41,829 --> 04:25:02,389
i like this thing a lot it's great it's a great follow-up from the other side

799
04:25:02,389 --> 04:25:14,920
good stuff finally got my build it only took to the last like 30 minutes of the game

800
04:25:14,920 --> 04:25:26,120
every hero who spawned upon nostalgaia i told their tale defined their tellings this is the end of

801
04:25:26,120 --> 04:25:42,840
your story start of sequence oh this is the i made it to the end zone we're not doing this

802
04:25:49,110 --> 04:26:19,180
you're ignoring the peppermint guy what peppermint guy all of heroes wait there's a door back here

803
04:26:19,180 --> 04:26:24,520
that i can open now all right hold on let me hang out here for a minute there's shit i can do here

804
04:26:24,520 --> 04:26:40,729
where is some of it there's some of those glitch doors here somebody ate 30 peppermints and is it

805
04:26:40,729 --> 04:26:58,409
gonna shit their pants um why are you eating that many what are you what are you doing have eat eat

806
04:26:59,209 --> 04:27:59,459
three okay looking for a glitch door i heard it blinking where is it further away now what the

807
04:27:59,459 --> 04:28:33,100
hell is making that sound is it just the torches and it's just messing with me it's in the wall

808
04:28:33,100 --> 04:29:32,549
or is it down it might be all the way down oh look what i found what was the point of this

809
04:29:32,549 --> 04:30:06,250
no point no point is it a memory maybe oh it's definitely that yes it is it's going to be the

810
04:30:06,250 --> 04:30:34,489
target chess piece there it is i think that might be better it's 18 13 20 my fat rolling

813
04:31:12,700 --> 04:31:16,299
him for a gingerbread house but there was some left and i ate the whole bag in a week and i ate

814
04:31:16,299 --> 04:31:24,540
two bags in a week and now i would say that i eat 20 a day i'm gonna tell you that's probably not a

815
04:31:24,540 --> 04:31:31,959

so there's two options i can either go back to the npc city and get to the end of that and see what

825
04:34:12,389 --> 04:34:16,860
the hell's there or i can just go to the end of the game um it's only been like four and a half

826
04:34:16,860 --> 04:34:29,290
hours i'm good i'm definitely good just to i mean why not i'll see what was at the end of it my

827
04:34:29,290 --> 04:34:35,130
sword girl uh i wanted to go do the loot thing i don't know what the fastest route to get there

828
04:34:35,130 --> 04:34:58,090
is from here but this thing is really good i really need to unlock it i think it's better

829
04:34:58,090 --> 04:35:07,819
than the sword it's kind of a long way to go i gotta somebody please keep in mind how they

830
04:35:07,819 --> 04:35:36,020
get here i'm not gonna remember this bet your ass i'm not okay so remember i need to go here

831
04:35:36,020 --> 04:35:45,139
eventually and they give you a pan that's what's there that's it's right next to the smith somebody

832
04:35:45,139 --> 04:36:05,450
remember that oh my god it scales with the yeah this is how you do it this is how you do it that's

833
04:36:05,450 --> 04:36:18,380
how you scale it with luck this is how you scale it with luck that was in damage for a crit what

834
04:36:18,380 --> 04:36:35,959
about the other one i can't do it to anything else oh no no no i can take this off all right

835
04:36:35,959 --> 04:36:53,900
but should i just do them both luck because this right now is just do both luck 1081 with a 13

836
04:36:53,900 --> 04:37:13,700
percent crit rating what uh-huh um it's over it paid off finally i just have to figure out what

837
04:37:13,700 --> 04:37:16,659
that you know on a second and third playthrough that's when you you know you know what you're

838
04:37:16,659 --> 04:37:25,130
doing all right so now i am going to go this way it's still a little bit more of an npc city

839
04:37:25,130 --> 04:38:10,090
to explore and that is precisely what i'm going to do now almost 1100 1200 damage oh all right we

840
04:38:10,090 --> 04:38:38,650
didn't we didn't get a crit but it was pretty cool i hear a uh glitch where is it where is it

841
04:38:38,650 --> 04:39:33,099
okay i got destroyed i think it's probably i don't know on the other side i don't know maybe somebody

842
04:39:33,099 --> 04:39:40,250
else will figure it out one day i don't think there are fake walls it's probably on the outside

843
04:39:40,250 --> 04:40:26,200
somewhere that way can i not walk up um i can't really go that way all right all right anybody

844
04:40:26,200 --> 04:40:35,189
have any idea how fast i can get to the loot place i don't think i even need it i am beefed

845
04:40:35,189 --> 04:41:11,000
up like crazy these crits are going to be so filthy it's it's not even going to matter yeah

846
04:41:11,000 --> 04:41:39,099

850
04:42:53,189 --> 04:42:59,750
to remember something guaranteed right there's no way there's no way that there's not a remembrance

851
04:42:59,750 --> 04:43:23,830

859
04:47:32,419 --> 04:47:49,540
what the fuck uh i'm not it's so it's such a free kill too that's the worst part that's the worst

860
04:47:49,540 --> 04:48:22,939

892
04:59:44,259 --> 04:59:50,020
they're super fast they can teleport and they don't even have a body they're just dust flying

893
04:59:50,020 --> 04:59:56,790
around and a pair of hands i know i want that item i'm just gonna run to it i ain't fighting

894
04:59:56,790 --> 05:00:09,529

897
05:01:08,810 --> 05:02:12,330

901
05:04:11,779 --> 05:04:21,049
he fell for the train there was no choo-choo before that blew down just happened it wasn't

902
05:04:21,049 --> 05:04:24,729
really anything for me to do maybe i guess maybe just block it or just stay i could i could just

903
05:04:24,729 --> 05:04:35,029
step out of the way i think that's what you're supposed to do and not freak out in my brain i

904
05:04:35,029 --> 05:04:40,790
thought if the in that split second of time that i had if the train hit me i was going off the map

905
05:04:40,790 --> 05:04:47,610
i was like i've been hit by this train before it's gonna knock me off the map but let's um

906
05:04:47,610 --> 05:05:08,840
will it hit them i fucking hope so oh my god i thought they despawned i was with why was the

907
05:05:08,840 --> 05:05:13,799
train i was waiting for the train i was waiting for the train the train did not i have to go try

908
05:05:13,799 --> 05:05:21,849
to okay i have to touch the lantern for the train to spawn i thought i had to just cross a certain

909
05:05:21,849 --> 05:05:29,939
plane and the train would spawn if i walked past it so i'm gonna take it very slow and i'm gonna

910
05:05:29,939 --> 05:05:38,819
kill everything there uh i have never really played f-zero somebody asked i've not played

911
05:05:38,819 --> 05:05:52,729
f-zero maybe a little bit when i was younger back in the day i remember it being too fast is that

912
05:05:52,729 --> 05:06:03,319
wrong no i'm thinking of a different game no maybe not i remember it being just everything was so

913
05:06:03,319 --> 05:06:36,389
fast okay i kind of like hurt my head to play at least the old one for the super nintendo how are

914
05:06:36,389 --> 05:07:06,659
you still alive what maybe it's not midnight it's only 10 30 so everyone that's trying to sleep

915
05:07:06,659 --> 05:07:23,830
all right wait wait wait wait wait wait does it not happen again i think it's just a one and done

916
05:07:23,830 --> 05:07:54,150
yeah i think just happens once consumables i believed in you we believe in you i hate this game

917
05:07:55,400 --> 05:08:18,650
i can't they have to do the big burst oh my god there's no way that i get launched that far

918
05:08:18,650 --> 05:08:41,659
i went soaring oh i get parry all right one and i fly back a thousand feet these enemies are really

919
05:08:41,659 --> 05:08:52,810
tricky i'm not gonna let it beat me though i will win we're gonna do that by simply just ignoring

920
05:08:52,810 --> 05:09:01,669
everything and just run to the end of the level check this out i want you all to pay close attention

921
05:09:03,400 --> 05:10:41,220
class is in session fuck you oh yes i'm out of it finally i saved that whole thing so i probably

922
05:10:41,220 --> 05:10:50,180
have enough what does this give you okay let's use everything that's probably the last buyer

923
05:10:50,180 --> 05:11:19,849
i'm gonna save this yeah use all the crunchies um wait i gotta make sure i tether myself to here

924
05:11:19,849 --> 05:11:41,380
it would be a disaster if i didn't let's see what is down here it's you again what do you got

925
05:11:41,380 --> 05:11:58,380
if you want to heal the heart that actually matters burden her oh hold on right here is

926
05:11:58,380 --> 05:12:26,220
this the dead space one no what is it part of a hero maybe i'll put it on 24 physical

927
05:12:26,220 --> 05:13:28,250
it doesn't really match i he got like trapped he got like he's like i heard like a crash i know

928
05:13:28,250 --> 05:13:31,290
i'm making a lot of noises right now but this is what happens when you're at the end of a game

929
05:13:31,290 --> 05:14:25,930
like this you just revert back to caveman talk what am i looking at oh shit no shit i feel like

930
05:14:25,930 --> 05:15:01,479

932
05:15:18,869 --> 05:15:24,790

933
05:15:24,790 --> 05:15:38,380
difficult their swing pattern is weird there's two or three different kinds of these enemies

934
05:15:38,380 --> 05:15:41,500
there's the one with the claws that have horizontal swings there's one with like a

935
05:15:41,500 --> 05:15:51,479
axe or some shit who cares all this area if you dodge you fall off the cliff

991
05:31:11,750 --> 05:31:17,979

1025
05:42:45,159 --> 05:42:50,840
there's a there's a lot of blocked doors maybe some kind of key or something i don't know

1026
05:42:56,979 --> 05:43:33,080
i'm not moving through that there we go look go flat on the castle oh that's not that's actually

1027
05:43:33,080 --> 05:43:58,680
a pretty good idea bro what do you how does it miss fuck off with this shit what is the crit

enemies swings shut up buddy flee flee from your doom i always see you train here it comes

1032
05:45:41,979 --> 05:46:09,779

1033
05:46:09,779 --> 05:47:01,770
unlock this first because i don't want to die but you know we'll see wait where are we this is a

1034
05:47:01,770 --> 05:48:02,229
shortcut back here uh let me level up okay so gotta go back should i make this should i tether

1035
05:48:02,229 --> 05:48:07,000
here because if i have the shortcut there i feel like i'm not able to run through a bunch of

1036
05:48:07,000 --> 05:48:43,139
bullshit right probably a good idea yeah i'm doing it we are painfully close we are almost there

1037
05:48:43,139 --> 05:48:57,349
then where do i go from here this game is a lot longer than i thought it was going to be

1038
05:48:57,349 --> 05:49:08,330
second or third stream of this game five six hours each 15 to 20 hour game i'm surprised i

1039
05:49:08,330 --> 05:49:36,250
thought it was going to be like 10 okay so this is where i ended up in there part of the sequence

1040
05:49:36,250 --> 05:49:49,700
um oh maybe okay yep no

1041
05:50:03,220 --> 05:50:54,759
narrator's pocket watch this is a weapon nine source get up there okay i'll be hiding right

1042
05:50:54,759 --> 05:51:20,490
there that's how i go back so right i don't think it's in here is it out there you how do

1043
05:51:20,490 --> 05:51:28,439
you like that eat shit eat shit you can't teleport up here and you don't even know how to use the

1044
05:51:28,439 --> 05:52:29,110
ladder over there straight ahead not a single crit to be had what i was out of the way complain

1045
05:52:29,110 --> 05:53:13,750

1047
05:53:31,400 --> 05:53:48,759
don't want me to go through this door is this thing teleport i think it does i am not we are

1048
05:53:48,759 --> 05:54:11,139
going back to where i can actually hit you would you know the truth of your get me up here would

1049
05:54:11,139 --> 05:54:40,119
you see the substance of what you are then come to me it's gonna be fake that's gonna be fake

1050
05:54:40,119 --> 05:55:00,939
it's not fake one more point what should i put it into has there ever been a fake one

1051
05:55:00,939 --> 05:55:13,580
there has been one or two fake ones just luck again we might as well go all in i wonder what

1052
05:55:13,580 --> 05:55:21,659
the caps are in this game they might not even be any caps i know new luck ability well that was a

1053
05:55:21,659 --> 05:55:37,659
good idea recover health on critical hit take no damage well too bad we didn't get that that's

1054
05:55:37,659 --> 05:55:54,330
actually really good all right game it's time for you to show us what the deal is big reveal

1055
05:55:54,330 --> 05:56:17,909
gonna be slug one hit i hate you and i do let me spin a tale to show you your journey here was

1056
05:56:17,909 --> 05:56:33,060
easy what see nostalgaia holds her hero's hands but what if the story had held nothing back

1057
05:56:37,060 --> 05:56:58,169
uh okay i tried to turn into the thing it's just b without pressing any other buttons right

1058
05:56:58,810 --> 05:57:26,250
ouch and i just got triple tapped i got triple tapped because of this

1059
05:57:26,250 --> 05:57:48,439
fucking sausage behind me this cigar behind me blocked me from going backwards your journey

1060
05:57:48,439 --> 05:58:14,090
here was easy all right bring it on string it together give me like three more of those

1061
05:58:14,090 --> 05:58:21,939
there it is that's why you build luck some skillet arms does not a true hero make

1062
05:58:21,939 --> 05:59:02,220
heroism is in the heart and yours is cruel okay why am i this doesn't seem right all that was good

1063
05:59:02,220 --> 05:59:09,740
lies dead at your feet this is your legacy you wish to rid nostalgaia of evil

1064
05:59:13,029 --> 06:00:03,220
then face it well that hurts a lot that's annoying why can't i get the front stab

1065
06:00:03,220 --> 06:00:31,979
three hits is good but you give me a couple crits there it is that was weird

1066
06:00:31,979 --> 06:01:02,569
i didn't hurt my intimate now gg were it only so easy everything i love destroyed

1067
06:01:02,569 --> 06:01:44,099
there's nothing left to tell oh shit you just got fucking destroyed still live you obliterated him

1068
06:01:44,180 --> 06:01:58,810
so hard he can't even move i fucked him up so bad oh no i can't feel bad i smushed him in the head

1069
06:01:58,810 --> 06:02:22,470
so hard i have hated what i feared you were a hero is no longer mine to tell if you truly be

1070
06:02:22,470 --> 06:02:35,290
different than the rest of your kind my study find the threads they're in and sever them

1071
06:03:08,470 --> 06:03:24,680
plot thread scissors wait that's a dex weapon isn't it kind of not really

1072
06:03:30,180 --> 06:04:05,459
damn okay level up i need to kill like one thing um no it's whatever wait watch this video

1073
06:04:05,459 --> 06:04:26,680
good video it was me barry i killed your favorite wait what is this roll up it was me germa i made

1074
06:04:26,680 --> 06:04:31,799
the final level of this game harder so you wouldn't be able to beat it making your sleep schedule a

1075
06:04:31,799 --> 06:04:40,520
little bit more difficult difficult enough for me to kill vinnie what is what is that

1076
06:04:41,669 --> 06:04:53,930
what character is that what characters are these who's this mustard guy i don't know what this is

1077
06:05:06,490 --> 06:05:22,340
all right let's end this it's reverse flash is reverse flash just really slow and lazy

1078
06:05:22,340 --> 06:05:36,709
it better be to me reverse flash is an insult like all right reverse flash it's like fuck off man

1083
06:06:42,659 --> 06:06:54,869
time that's like down in one of the first area like the second or third area staging room

1084
06:06:54,869 --> 06:07:06,630
anybody know actually let me level up one more time i'm gonna have enough in a second

1085
06:07:07,189 --> 06:07:40,889
obliterated the left room go behind the elevator back wait wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong

1086
06:07:40,889 --> 06:07:46,180

1087
06:07:46,180 --> 06:08:17,979
find the elevator very cool and then down the hell did you know that now isn't it down here

1088
06:08:18,540 --> 06:08:36,439

1089
06:08:36,439 --> 06:08:53,419
wrong no help yes help staging room in the tutorial area okay so where is that it's been

1090
06:08:53,419 --> 06:08:59,900
a lot of twists and a lot of turns a lot of twists and turns a lot of doors a lot of things to

1091
06:08:59,900 --> 06:09:05,540
remember a lot of openings a lot of places to go a lot of things to see a lot of things to do

1092
06:09:05,540 --> 06:09:12,020
a lot of places to look at a lot of enemies to attack a lot of things to do a lot of things

1093
06:09:12,020 --> 06:10:12,119
to be a lot of places to see found it correct oh yes no what's going on in here definitely

1094
06:10:12,119 --> 06:10:36,069
remember something what is this strength the memory saber the almighty inspiration had always

1095
06:10:36,069 --> 06:10:42,490
been treated as set dressing a thematic arch type merely used for props but purposelessness

1096
06:10:42,490 --> 06:10:48,700
led many npcs and heroes to try and grasp the ungraspable they formed cults creeds and

1097
06:10:48,700 --> 06:10:54,360
superstitions trying to make meaning out of their now meaningless existence the institutions they

1098
06:10:54,360 --> 06:11:21,319

1134
06:30:53,139 --> 06:31:10,330
for fucking years it's been years that's what i'm talking about that's what i mean aggression

1135
06:31:10,330 --> 06:31:17,130
aggressive only sekiro taught me that what do you say overconfidence could be a slow and insidious

1136

1143
06:36:48,729 --> 06:37:02,020
loud loud this game is i turned it down to where is that where the hell is that that was a demon

1144
06:37:02,020 --> 06:37:28,060
face does everybody remember what that is it's in the demon room by the shop yeah in hell with the

1145
06:37:28,060 --> 06:38:02,470
pink guy the shop at the market square market square yeah second area of the game can somebody

1148
06:39:22,150 --> 06:39:43,209
hurt that much it's all right homeward bone it's what exactly what i was thinking carry on down

1149
06:39:43,209 --> 06:39:47,049
the path by the shop there's a trek down a snowy mountain with some tough monsters for this early

1150
06:39:47,049 --> 06:40:06,779
in the game make it at the bottom though and there's a cave this can be remembered here let

1151
06:40:06,779 --> 06:40:19,349
me use my points there we go what's the one of the last luck abilities with something crazy right

1152
06:40:19,349 --> 06:40:31,779
okay take no damage so there's a one percent chance that i don't take damage whenever i get hit

1153
06:40:31,779 --> 06:41:05,669
or what do these percentages mean okay so it's guys i'm standing here which way i'm seeing behind

1154
06:41:05,669 --> 06:41:16,419
you behind you there's only one shop in the game yeah but this was three days ago it may as well

1155
06:41:16,419 --> 06:41:35,319
has never happened well he's wait what about this thing down here i'm curious about this

1156
06:41:35,319 --> 06:41:49,590
where are my friends i'm not too proud to admit you've taught me much old friend rules cannot

1157
06:41:49,590 --> 06:41:56,229
prevent a hero from fulfilling their destiny we were not spawned accepted so we surpassed

1158
06:41:56,229 --> 06:42:02,630
expectation look upon me now great ones look and tremble

1159
06:42:02,709 --> 06:42:13,770
oh i will face the pipe layer i make my own destiny i make all right what about you i have

1160
06:42:13,770 --> 06:42:20,889
literally only two people made it no three gone off script have you most noble heroes follow the

1161
06:42:20,889 --> 06:42:31,110
path prescribed between you and i i do not know how a single great one yet remains between you

1162
06:42:31,110 --> 06:42:36,549
and an open heart the pipe layer pipe layer stood within the layer of the adversary when you have

1163
06:42:36,549 --> 06:42:42,709
done all else you require seek the unbreachable more beneath or shaft there's a well-traveled

1164
06:42:42,709 --> 06:42:48,549

1200
06:59:13,720 --> 06:59:20,810
like a few different endings i'm imagining is that little dude just keep showing up and telling me

1201
06:59:20,810 --> 06:59:40,340
to do that maybe if you unburden a certain amount of items that makes sense okay i really have to be

1202
06:59:40,340 --> 06:59:45,540
very careful here i'm gonna try as hard as i can i'm not gonna make a gigachad fall joke i wasn't

1292
07:36:27,270 --> 07:36:33,619
meaningful about this item a legacy that can live on in you returning this to nostalgaia through

1293
07:36:33,619 --> 07:36:52,759
her beacons will increase the use of your heroic icon well i probably missed what too cool 45 is

1295
07:36:58,330 --> 07:37:18,220
what is through here where this is the this has got to be the final arc of the game hold up okay

1296
07:37:18,220 --> 07:37:54,900
the whole thing's coming down you said that three ox ago why are you questioning me if i had 40 or

1297
07:37:54,900 --> 07:38:17,979
50 decks these would hit for a lot more i got them all back too i didn't want to lose the lock

1298
07:38:17,979 --> 07:38:39,110
on so the final boss is absolutely super mario right in quotes there's no way this is not mario

1299
07:38:39,110 --> 07:38:46,419

1302
07:40:23,529 --> 07:40:29,029

07:40:29,029 --> 07:41:21,580
should do hmm what is that for i don't know oh i'm very confused what about your lasagna

1304

hurry the freak up kidding it's 1 30 in the morning okay let's go and who might you be it is i jock

1324
07:54:05,860 --> 07:54:19,220
geek of the thong kingdom no you know what you can just call me jock you can call me

1325
07:54:19,220 --> 07:54:48,970
fucking jockstrap what is this little shimmy oh my goodness dude well this is going to be um

1326
07:54:48,970 --> 07:55:05,799
barely difficult jockstrap didn't quite make it do i have to shimmy every single time here i can't

1327
07:55:05,799 --> 07:56:34,659
just open the door all right strategy is just dodge one two and it's a spin what the dude this

1328
07:56:34,659 --> 07:56:53,349
guy wait you're holy shit man you're annoying just turn around turn around turn around come on

1329
07:56:53,349 --> 07:57:32,119
but he's small he's small get him when he's small get him when he's small where what what

1330
07:57:32,119 --> 07:58:15,240
just excuse me full health again dude what he jumped on the throne do i have a very important

1331
07:58:15,240 --> 07:58:35,000
question we're gonna see my what is it called fragment of tradition i think i can get something

1332
07:58:35,000 --> 07:58:44,490
to max level now right piece of tradition there it is uh if i have a if i keep having trouble here

1333
07:58:44,490 --> 07:58:58,259
i'm probably gonna have to upgrade the weapons something tells me when you get them down to

1334
07:58:58,259 --> 07:59:18,779
really small maybe i can do something the loot too yeah we'll see i wonder if there's any strategy

1335
07:59:18,779 --> 07:59:29,830
i don't know maybe parries i feel like let me let's you know what i'm gonna try let's try parries

1336
07:59:29,830 --> 07:59:49,299
get that shit out of here it's an annoying move he's so slow it's gonna be so hard to parry

1337
07:59:55,189 --> 08:00:05,750
can't even i can't even get up i couldn't even move he switches back and forth from unbelievably

1338
08:00:05,750 --> 08:00:32,970
slow to unbelievably fast he's one of those dumb bosses you can't just you can't oh why can't i

1339
08:00:32,970 --> 08:01:04,970
not open this why why can't i open that no parry's not gonna work parry's not gonna cut it

1340
08:01:04,970 --> 08:01:17,130
there's got to be a catch to when you get them small turtle with the shield i'll try it one more

1341
08:01:17,130 --> 08:01:31,770
time where is the attack where is the attack opportunity on this asshole like the guy just

1342
08:01:32,009 --> 08:01:43,740
like what even if i got in there i wouldn't have time to swing one time even if i got in there he's

1343
08:01:43,740 --> 08:01:50,259
already doing another move and you just get hit for me to go like this i'm in he's already swinging

1344
08:01:50,259 --> 08:02:00,740
again uh all right i gotta i'm gonna go upgrade like here's the great question i am so far i don't

1345
08:02:00,740 --> 08:02:20,840
think i can maybe through the staff room i could probably do the staff room but i honestly i was

1346
08:02:20,840 --> 08:02:29,540
running through this so fast because this last area has been just chaos which is apps just just

1347
08:02:29,540 --> 08:02:40,500
carnage at every corner that whole last 40 minutes was a blur i don't remember how i got

1348
08:02:40,500 --> 08:03:00,580
in here i remember just sprinting through because it was just a fucking mess on i can't even see

1349
08:03:00,580 --> 08:03:56,380
myself on the screen all right let's go mario jesus dude what the fuck what are you doing

1350
08:04:00,520 --> 08:04:21,689
oh my god stop swinging the fucking weapon for one second get him small then it's free

1351
08:04:21,689 --> 08:04:37,500
this asshole was jumping around everywhere just be patient this the the attack opportunities seem

1352
08:04:37,500 --> 08:04:46,139
like zero for the for as long as me to go like this he's already doing something else the fuck

1353
08:05:03,590 --> 08:05:34,630
under leveled no way 63 what what should i be 80 103 okay no one two one two two three

throne sits before you the epicenter of nostalgaia's conflict you have liberated

1368
08:11:48,099 --> 08:11:52,259
and restored so much perhaps if you claim this authority for yourself you could be the one to

1369
08:11:52,259 --> 08:12:29,319
fix all of nostalgaia's problems here's the thing not quite the thing beneath here it lies open for

1370
08:12:29,319 --> 08:12:53,240
you enter it ready for all of this to end uh might as well just keep it going good luck helps so much

1371
08:12:54,599 --> 08:13:00,069
all right so that that was probably bad end or maybe one of the i imagine there's probably two

1372
08:13:00,069 --> 08:13:07,700
three endings but here we go this is this good end you think find out memory flows freely into

1373
08:13:07,700 --> 08:13:11,939
nostalgaia's open heart she's ready to receive you when you are ready to complete your heroic

1374
08:13:11,939 --> 08:13:16,810
journey give your memory back to the world all right so i have to give all my memories back

1375
08:13:17,529 --> 08:13:24,220
or i just take the throne but i'm curious let's see what happens warning this will end the game

1376
08:13:24,860 --> 08:13:37,990
i cut the cord yeah you want to pull what do you guys think should we pull it up i mean you

1377
08:13:37,990 --> 08:13:46,520
guys stuck around for this long i feel like you should have a say let's go for it take the throne

1378
08:13:46,520 --> 08:13:57,270
or restore the memory and by the way i can veto either one so nah i want to do this never mind

1379
08:13:58,659 --> 08:14:16,729
i'm doing this never mind game over sorry everybody okay oh well it was 82 percent anyways

1380
08:14:17,689 --> 08:14:38,869
jesus oh my god is this it's gonna be another thing at the end right

1381
08:14:39,669 --> 08:15:04,340
oh my god i'm so sorry most credits let's find out i didn't i i have my game volume turned pretty

1382
08:15:04,340 --> 08:15:17,770
far down too all right are you ready for the review are you ready for the review that last

1383
08:15:17,770 --> 08:15:32,540
area was a mess but there's a lot of really cool shit in this game i feel like you could play

1384
08:15:32,540 --> 08:15:36,540
through it a couple times with different types of classes i love the memory thing that's a really

1385
08:15:36,540 --> 08:15:44,200
nice twist on upgrading weapons super cool game was actually pretty phenomenal i would say

1386
08:15:46,520 --> 08:15:51,159
i'm gonna be i'm gonna be weird here i'm gonna be weird here i think i don't think a lot of

1387
08:15:51,159 --> 08:16:31,580
people are expecting this this is a um this is a this is an 8.7 there it is 8.7 this is yeah that

1388
08:16:31,580 --> 08:16:45,110
was great that was like very very very fun i would say that was great i i i think this is not a seven

1389
08:16:45,110 --> 08:16:56,040
if you take away the memory aspect of this game i think that's bumping it up a whole letter grade

1390
08:16:56,040 --> 08:17:08,520
for me that system is really unique and deserves praise the 8.7 that was great was it better than

1391
08:17:08,520 --> 08:17:13,560
eternal cylinder i mean i give what i give eternal cylinder like a 6.7 or like a seven or something

1392
08:17:13,560 --> 08:17:34,860
like that 7.5 yeah i think this the this game was way more than i ever expected i've really really

1393
08:17:34,860 --> 08:17:46,979
enjoyed it somebody said this earlier i've played i've how many times have you seen me attempt to

1394
08:17:46,979 --> 08:17:52,860
play as souls like in quotes and i kind of just like yeah that was like kind of fun for three four

1395
08:17:52,860 --> 08:18:01,159
hours but i'll move on that happens a lot i've i know i have loaded up on this stream and off stream

1396
08:18:01,159 --> 08:18:07,319
too at least a half dozen souls likes and i just kind of give up in the first like four or five

1397
08:18:07,319 --> 08:18:14,869
hours i did not do that with this this this kept my attention the whole time it's got that crazy

1398
08:18:14,869 --> 08:18:20,069
every single thing is connected dark souls one for all of you dark souls one brains out there

1399
08:18:20,069 --> 08:18:29,369
um i'd say you probably would like that i thought it was very very good i thought it was great

1400
08:18:30,009 --> 08:18:37,430
and to me somewhere in the eights is great not quite a nine i think nine implies it's like

1401
08:18:37,430 --> 08:18:47,000
incredible i think that was great and there's a lot of i didn't see there's probably a couple

1402
08:18:47,000 --> 08:18:51,159
areas i probably kind of ran through skipped over that last area was a little messy but

1403
08:18:51,159 --> 08:18:56,939
all in all can't complain all in all the games in eight point uh seven not like me reviewing

1404
08:18:56,939 --> 08:19:06,259
anything matters be giving a score is is it doesn't really mean very much but it's great

1405
08:19:06,259 --> 08:19:33,610
all right everybody what about the blunt rotation oh shit okay uh pink eye's not coming anywhere

1406
08:19:33,610 --> 08:19:44,619
near like where i live i just want to make that really clear um probably the lasagna that i

1407
08:19:44,619 --> 08:20:08,200
didn't eat the guy that betrayed us in the end and the uh the old the old guy also the game's

1408
08:20:08,200 --> 08:20:15,319
like an eight high kind of mid to high eight for me just because i actually might play it again

1409
08:20:15,319 --> 08:20:21,560
off stream just like in my own time and play like a sorcery that's how i can tell that like all right

1410
08:20:21,560 --> 08:20:30,069
all right so that should be a couple of notches higher it's got multiplayer too isn't that

1411
08:20:30,069 --> 08:20:43,529
actually though well done collapse in the chat for the developers i don't know how much is this game

1412
08:20:43,529 --> 08:21:05,799
seems like it's got a lot of secrets how much does this cost it's 25 bucks 25 bucks it's got

1413
08:21:05,799 --> 08:21:16,700
a demo too that's that's fair as hell fair as hell uh nice job that game was great i will see

1414
08:21:16,700 --> 08:21:28,810
you guys in a few days probably be live on wednesday i think did three days in a row here

1415
08:21:28,810 --> 08:21:40,040
probably take two days here i don't know if i'm i i i really like doing these i say this every

1416
08:21:40,040 --> 08:21:44,759
single stream i feel like at the end of the the late night streams but they they hit so different

1417
08:21:44,759 --> 08:21:56,520
that i just it's probably staying have a great night get some sleep see you later take care

1418
08:21:56,520 --> 08:22:12,779
of yourselves it's kind of a clean slate as of this coming week don't really have anything planned

1419
08:22:12,779 --> 08:22:32,840
so we can maybe fill in some stuff it's been a wonderful night yeah it's been great hope you

1420
08:22:32,840 --> 08:22:42,500
had a good time what about sorcery please please i'll probably pick what's gonna have to happen is

1421
08:22:42,500 --> 08:22:47,209
i'm gonna have to catch myself back up with what happened in sorcery we might we might have to do

1422
08:22:47,209 --> 08:22:53,560
a little recap stream where we said we have to kind of remember what happened and go from there

1423
08:22:53,560 --> 08:23:06,220
because i was sort of a third of the way through the third episode i enjoyed my stay and then you

1424
08:23:06,220 --> 08:23:28,340
drew a dick all right i'll let it slide it got removed hey as as the mods have famously said

1425
08:23:28,340 --> 08:23:37,700
i would be banned from my own stream and i would be banned from my own discord and we gotta have

1426
08:23:37,700 --> 08:23:47,689
we have to have order though you know what i mean there has to be order right otherwise it just

1427
08:23:47,689 --> 08:24:03,560
develops devolves into just chaos you gotta have we have to have an order all right good morning

1431
08:25:12,889 --> 08:25:23,930
i don't know what to tell her uh still would have waited a little bit longer all right see you wednesday
