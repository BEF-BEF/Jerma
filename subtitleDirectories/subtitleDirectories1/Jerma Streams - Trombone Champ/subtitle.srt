1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:21,579
How you doing? What's up? What's up? How you doing? Doing great. Good. Hold on. I got a cough.

2
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:41,049
Okay. Yeah, we're gonna play trombone champ. Start from there. This game is apparently an hour or

3
00:00:41,049 --> 00:00:54,020
two, right? Did you get sloppy? What? Because I had to cough? No, no, no, I don't turn 37. And

4
00:00:54,020 --> 00:01:00,200
everybody starts calling me sloppy. That's not how this No, no, no, no, I am. I am built like a

5
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:05,780
fucking some kind of animal, whatever it is. I told I said in pre stream, this was not going

6
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:13,180
to be a crack stream. And I'm going to stand by it. I don't know something in the air today or

7
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:22,500
yesterday. I don't know. I'm just like I'm in a weird mood. I have this constant urge to just say

8
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:26,980
just this weird shit. I don't know why I just say it's like fun to me today and yesterday.

9
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:38,310
It's because it's a blood moon. Is it? It's co2 poisoning. It's not. You know why I know it's not.

10
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:48,659
I know it's not co2 poisoning. Because I have a co2 monitor in my place. I know exactly how much

11
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:56,469
carbon dioxide is in the air at any given moment. So I know I know the exact parts per million

12
00:01:57,269 --> 00:02:09,849
of co2 in this place. Would you like to know what it is? I can tell you right now. Yeah, why do you

13
00:02:09,849 --> 00:02:18,729
guys think I got the water quality test strips? I mean, I pissed on one for a joke. But yeah,

14
00:02:18,729 --> 00:02:28,629
the co2 in the air inside of my place ranges from 480 to like 600 or 700 at night with the

15
00:02:28,629 --> 00:02:34,919
you know with the window closed. You want as long as that number is under 800 or 900.

16
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:48,810
The typical indoor environment for co2 is four to 800 or 700. It's too much. No, not degrees.

17
00:02:54,460 --> 00:03:02,819
This motherfucker opens his windows at night. Yes. Did you know? And okay. All right. Yeah,

18
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:09,610
let me out. Yeah, I watched the Tom Scott video where he talks about co2 and I freaked out and

19
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:27,340
bought a co2 monitor. That's what happened. Like everybody else. People whooing Tom Scott. What are

20
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:37,219
you crazy? That's not that's not happen. That's not possible. Right? Yeah. So in the Tom Scott

21
00:03:37,219 --> 00:03:45,930
video, Tom Scott was essentially showcasing another youtuber who trapped himself in a air

22
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:54,330
tight chamber and monitored the co2 and monitored how he felt once it hit certain parts. It's very

23
00:03:54,330 --> 00:04:03,669
interesting stuff. If you have a moment to check it out, I would. So I saw the video, I freaked out

24
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:10,629
and I bought a co2 monitor. And ever since, I've been keeping an eye on it. And I open,

25
00:04:10,629 --> 00:04:17,800
you know, open up the windows, get some airflow. That's how you reduce co2. Which is actually kind

26
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:24,759
of hard in Vegas because it gets really, really hot and really, really cold. You're paranoid. No,

27
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:33,420
I'm not. What? Just simply monitoring the co2. It is what? That's supposed to be paranoid.

28
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:43,110
Yeah, it's a gas. It's a co2 gas. You think I'm not going to be concerned about it a little?

29
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:56,680
No, you'd be aware of kind of what your surroundings, you know, be aware. But no,

30
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:03,860
honestly, the Tom Scott video is actually really interesting. I, Tom Scott's videos are so cool

31
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:09,459
because it's not just typical stuff. It's just like this water behind me is electrified. If you

32
00:05:09,459 --> 00:05:15,220
touch it, you will die. And I'm like, what, where is this? Why is this water electrified? Who did

33
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:21,139
this? And then he goes into this whole thing and it's like, and the videos are not like, they're

34
00:05:21,139 --> 00:05:27,689
short. And it's true. If you did, if you touch that water, you're going to get electrocuted.

35
00:05:28,569 --> 00:05:45,879
It's not bullshit. I do. I watched Tom's videos. The average human emits over two tons of co2 a

36
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:52,660
week. Is that real? Well, the reason why you want to monitor your co2 in your bedroom or whatever,

37
00:05:54,259 --> 00:05:59,939
is because at night you're exhaling in the same room, sometimes with the door closed,

38
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:09,449
and you are just dumping co2 into your room just for eight, seven, six, seven, eight, nine plus

39
00:06:09,449 --> 00:06:16,759
hours a night. And if you don't have ventilation and the door is closed, you want to get some nice

40
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:19,879
fresh air in there sometimes. Even if you don't have to sleep with the window open. But you know,

41
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:29,269
if weather permits, crack the window for a little bit. That'd be all day. Crack the window for a

42
00:06:29,269 --> 00:06:41,670
little bit, just for a little bit, especially during these months where you can. What if it's

43
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:48,709
too noisy? Also, another thing is airflow. So look, I watched Tom Scott. Okay, I'm going to

44
00:06:48,709 --> 00:07:09,079
give you some education here. I'm a Tom Scott watcher. Let's go. Teacher. But no, if you have

45
00:07:09,079 --> 00:07:17,610
the door open to your bedroom, at least the air can kind of move in and out. Yeah, I just look,

46
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:24,170
you know, okay, I don't want to like do some fear dropping here. You're if your co2 levels

47
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:29,129
in your house, you're not going to you're going to be okay. All right. I think it's over what's the

48
00:07:29,129 --> 00:07:38,699
over 1000 over 1200 parts per million is considered like really stale and not good. So most typical

49
00:07:38,699 --> 00:07:44,459
houses sit between a very average, very fine level. Just open your windows every now and again,

50
00:07:44,459 --> 00:07:49,899
just get some fresh air in. Oh, that kind of reminds me of a story. Actually, it's a tweet

51
00:07:49,899 --> 00:07:58,199
that I never tweeted out. So one time when me and Holly first started dating, I, I had what did I

52
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:08,149
tell us already? Did I already tell this? It's about me opening the door for a reason. Okay,

53
00:08:08,149 --> 00:08:14,310
well, I'll tell it anyways. Okay, so when me and Holly started first dating, I obviously didn't

54
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:26,620
want to like fart near her. So what I did is I she was in another room. And I went to the front door

55
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:32,039
and I opened the front door and put my ass out the front door and went like,

56
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:39,639
and like farted. And maybe a full half second after I farted, Augusta wind blew from my back

57
00:08:39,639 --> 00:08:46,009
back into the house. And I freaked out. I was like, No, not the whole reason why I did this.

58
00:08:54,070 --> 00:09:00,549
Sure. Well, no, nobody. Okay, I don't care what anybody says. Nobody in the first three to six

59
00:09:00,549 --> 00:09:07,340
months of their relationship goes to the bathroom. Do you know what I mean by that?

60
00:09:08,379 --> 00:09:13,179
Like in the first three months of a new relationship, nobody goes to the bathroom.

61
00:09:13,179 --> 00:09:21,049
Nobody has to take a shit. It doesn't work that way. I like, oh, yeah, okay. Yeah, yeah, come over.

62
00:09:21,049 --> 00:09:24,970
Yeah. Okay. Hold on. But like, before you come over, though, I've got to like work on the car

63
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:27,769
in the garage. It's like, I need like, I'm going to spend like 40 minutes going to the bathroom to

64
00:09:27,769 --> 00:09:36,039
make sure I don't have to like farting in front of a new girlfriend or new boyfriend. That's not

65
00:09:36,039 --> 00:09:43,139
going to happen. I'm sorry. If I have to take a shit and like my new partner is over, my new

66
00:09:43,139 --> 00:09:51,429
girlfriend is over, whatever. I have to go work on the car. And oh, hey, by the way. Oh, by the way,

67
00:09:51,429 --> 00:09:54,629
like downstairs, I had this an electrical problem. Don't come down here for an hour.

68
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:02,820
Don't you can't come. Don't come. Don't come into this room for like an hour. There's an

69
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:14,440
electrical problem. Just like, freak him out. I don't do that. I'm fucking kidding. This is a joke.

70
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:27,159
There's CO2 in that room. Don't go in that room. Imagine being a neighbor walking by and your

71
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:39,929
neighbor opens his door and rips ass out the door. Or imagine being on like a security cam,

72
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:47,419
like somebody else's security cam. Like imagine like, oh, what happened on the security cam today?

73
00:10:47,419 --> 00:11:06,019
It's like, wait, what's going on? Ring doorbell. Oh, my God. But anyways,

74
00:11:07,379 --> 00:11:15,720
yeah, I don't like to just like rip ass in front of a new girlfriend. I don't think anybody does

75
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:22,940
that. Why would you have to give me the benefit of the doubt here? Most people don't really do

76
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:28,139
that immediately. It's not like, oh, hey, yeah, come on in. Oh, yeah, this is my place. Oh, yeah,

77
00:11:28,139 --> 00:11:34,539
let me give you a quick little tour. Sorry fart. It was loud. Oh, be careful. Oh, come on over here.

78
00:11:34,539 --> 00:11:38,460
It's like, what the fuck, man? What are you talking about? That's not going to happen.

79
00:11:39,429 --> 00:11:49,990
I don't think any of you will do that. Who is going to do that? I don't know what I don't know.

80
00:11:50,549 --> 00:11:55,269
Jupiter is in some kind of blood moon right now. I'm sorry. The last two days have been weird. I've

81
00:11:55,269 --> 00:12:12,549
been very, very like overly energetic and shit. What's going on? Dude, just fart like everybody

82
00:12:12,549 --> 00:12:23,379
else. You just turned 37. Yeah. And I'm trying to tell you how I'm a considerate person.

83
00:12:25,139 --> 00:12:35,190
I don't want to invite somebody over and fart on them. What? How did you draw this this quickly?

84
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:52,120
You've been talking about arts for 10 minutes straight. Yeah. OK. If you want to play the

85
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:58,600
you're 37 while you're talking about arts card. OK. I want you to open up every every television

86
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:05,559
show in the last two decades and I want you to find me that the only time that there's no like

87
00:13:05,559 --> 00:13:13,879
art jokes in that show in the last like 20 years and those shows are written by like 40 year olds

88
00:13:13,879 --> 00:13:24,009
plus 50 year olds. Simpsons. Simpsons had a ton of fart jokes. We talked about Breaking Bad had a

89
00:13:24,009 --> 00:13:29,370
huge fart joke. Remember when when when Walter put his legs behind his head and took a lighter and

90
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:45,240
farted into it and he did a flame. That happened. I just spilt shit all over me because I'm trying

91
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:58,330
not to laugh at that. I'm sorry. The reaction. All right. God damn it. Hold on. In Game of Thrones.

92
00:13:58,330 --> 00:14:09,110
Yeah. You don't remember in Game of Thrones when when Grand Maester Pycelle did the lighter fart

93
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:16,870
flame joke. All these old bones are hard to move but he puts his legs behind his head.

94
00:14:24,649 --> 00:14:30,710
Let me ask you a really quick question though. If. OK. Be very honest and I want to poll for this.

95
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:38,889
If Grand Maester Pycelle did that in the final episode of Game of Thrones season eight you would

96
00:14:38,889 --> 00:14:48,649
have a better you would have a better view of that whole show. I guarantee it. People wouldn't care

97
00:14:48,649 --> 00:14:52,169
that it ended terribly and like the last season was terrible. It was like holy shit we got like

98
00:14:52,169 --> 00:14:57,450
the Grand Maester Pycelle dumb and dumber Jim Carrey fart scene. I don't care anymore that the

99
00:14:57,450 --> 00:15:11,740
show was terrible. I get we had that now or he doesn't he doesn't have to like kill a skeleton.

100
00:15:20,120 --> 00:16:14,039
All right. I got to clean. I spilt shit all over me. Hold on. Have I been sitting here for 20

101
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:26,870
minutes doing this. What the fuck man. It's been seven. It's been for 17 minutes. I need like a

102
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:36,259
producer in my ear. Just being like hey dude it's time to move on. Hey hey move on to something

103
00:16:36,259 --> 00:16:49,559
else. I think I would probably ignore the producer. I probably would. You guys you guys would honestly

104
00:16:49,559 --> 00:16:55,460
think I was even more unhinged because I would be referencing the producer without even telling

105
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:59,379
you that I was talking to anybody else. If I was sitting there talking about like farting out the

106
00:16:59,379 --> 00:17:03,860
front door and in my ear was hey dude no no no no move on. I'd be like I'm not going to move on.

107
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:10,950
Don't tell me to move on. And you guys be like who the fuck is that. All right we're going to play

108
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:25,940
uh trombone champion. Trombone champion. Uh it's a game requested to play. Looks like it's really fun

109
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:31,049
and interesting. I don't know. I don't really know much about it. What I do know is other

110
00:17:31,049 --> 00:17:48,380
streamers played it. So my turn. Is it. So I know. It's fun. Well let's go. All right so how does it

114
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:54,920
One day you will rent the very fabric that binds this land. But until that day comes

115
00:18:56,039 --> 00:19:08,569
you must toot. Toot your trombone brave soul. And you may yet become the trombone champ. Cool.

116
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:17,109
George Washington. Was that like Thomas Jefferson. Who was that.

00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:26,220
All right. Welcome to trombone champ. Choose play to play the main game.

118
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:37,109
Many secrets await. All right. Try. Do settings or anything. Uh mouse speed. I think that's fine.

119
00:19:38,069 --> 00:19:45,910
Annoyances. Funny jump scares. What should I do with this. Turn up the baboon quality. No.

120
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:50,940
We're not. I'm doing normal. I'm not going right into this. Let me just play it first.

121
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:55,339
I'm just going to play it. I'm not going to. Oh turn on this like funny mode. Why would I turn on

122
00:19:55,420 --> 00:20:07,140
like DK whatever it is. The big head 007 mode right now. Okay. Choose your tromboner.

123
00:20:07,779 --> 00:20:24,779
Okay. Boomer. Yeah. I mean you guys remember 007. Goldeneye had the cheats where you could

124
00:20:24,779 --> 00:20:29,480
what you can make people's big head. I'm not doing that immediately. You play the game first.

125
00:20:30,779 --> 00:20:34,980
All right. Let's go. Trombone. There's other instruments. All right. I don't even care.

127
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:54,660
Move the mouse forward and back to move the slide. Line up the dot with the note lines.

So you go this way to go. Press left. What's this better mouse or keyboard mouse. Press left mouse

129
00:21:11,349 --> 00:21:17,660

130
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:23,609
how it works. Watch the breath meter. If you hold a note for too long you'll run out of breath.

131
00:21:23,609 --> 00:21:47,369
Okay. Have fun. Okay. Enjoy the beautiful succulent. It's supposed to be inverted.

132
00:21:53,609 --> 00:22:23,019
It's inverted. Can I change that? It's inverted. I got to change the inverted thing. I feel like

00:22:23,019 --> 00:22:33,000
there's a like this kid in the in the in the house really practicing for their like band practice

tomorrow. Okay. This is fun. Oh what. Okay. All right. I get it. That's funny. It's fun. I actually

135
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:04,630
think this is cool. All right. Let me. I don't want it to be inverted. I feel like I'm like

136
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:22,700
flying a plane or something. Not inverted. Is that cheating? Is it cheating? I just want to

137
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:31,450
make sure it's not cheating. All right. This is. Oh this is. There are between two and four spiders

138
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:52,869
living inside the average trombone. That's not real. Do characters. Characters. What? This is

139
00:23:52,869 --> 00:24:01,180
the New Year's Eve party and little Timmy's been practicing for everybody. If I see one person

140
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:13,019
smirk you're fucking kicked out of the party. I will throw you out myself. See right now. I'm

141
00:24:13,019 --> 00:24:24,630
not even enjoying the music. I'm looking around like this. Seeing who's laughing at my son.

142
00:25:21,369 --> 00:25:40,970
All right. That's it. How long is this old thing? You were laughing at your own son.

143
00:25:41,529 --> 00:25:53,019
Oh I wasn't. I wasn't laughing at my own son. I was merely enjoying the song. All right.

144
00:25:55,180 --> 00:26:05,190
Uh dudes. This is trombone. Holy wow. Oh Canada. Why don't we. How many songs are there?

145
00:26:08,579 --> 00:26:12,279
This one's really hard apparently. Wait. We need to do Oh Canada because this is like.

146
00:26:13,609 --> 00:26:42,950
This is not hard. Wait. Go back. Character two. What? Cool. All right. Let's do uh. That one's

147
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:53,029
apparently. That's pretty hard. Let's do Oh Canada. The first trombone was invented in 20 million BC.

148
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:51,259
It's a game. It's a game. It's a game. Do they all have like a remix? Is this going to be like.

149
00:27:54,059 --> 00:28:04,009
And then go like. And then go like kind of crazy. I hope so. Oh the last one did it.

150
00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:21,849
Cool. All right. So this one is beer barrel polka. God save the king. Beethoven's fifth

151
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:32,740
scabbard stars and stripes. William Tell. Oh I know this one. The star spangled banner.

152
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:39,019
This is actually quite a lot. Sugar plum fairy.

153
00:28:42,299 --> 00:35:10,099
Ball game. Wait is this. Oh yeah. Okay. I'm going to 100% this one.

154
00:35:22,420 --> 00:36:23,420
Go. Give me an S. Oh. All right. I'll do entertainer. Everyone wants. Everyone wants me to do it.

155
00:36:27,059 --> 00:36:39,079
Wait. I want to do William Tell. Let's go. This one's going to be nuts. Oh this one goes.

156
00:38:34,219 --> 00:39:05,829
No way. No way. But that's all right. No way. But it's okay. Oh yeah. Let's go. Oh fuck. Hold on.

157
00:39:12,139 --> 00:41:01,829
Oh my God. Why am I messing this up? Oh shit. My arm. I can't. Okay. Who hired this guy?

158
00:41:10,019 --> 00:41:12,820
I got an A on that. I could probably do that better. I could do that much better.

159
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:28,070
Yeah. I can 100% do that better. You know I got to find a different way to sit. You know what I'm

160
00:41:28,070 --> 00:41:34,070
saying? I feel like I want to be putting my arm forward more. Like leaning back and holding my

161
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:41,050
arm out like this. I have my whole arm and wrist on the mouse pad. All right. I'll do entertainer

162
00:41:41,050 --> 00:41:57,460
now. Okay. Okay. Where is it? Entertainer. Okay. Here we go. There's over nine songs that feature

163
00:41:57,460 --> 00:43:30,840
trombone. That's interesting. I didn't even think about that. That's a good song. All right. Now

164
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:51,539
let's do whatever. Do gladiators. Gladiators. Is that true? It takes a thousand people to make

165
00:43:51,539 --> 00:45:32,760
one trombone. There's not enough room on my mouse pad. That song's called gladiators. Interesting.

166
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:43,639
How about skip to my loo? You know I'm going to get my keyboard off the desk area here. This is

167
00:45:43,639 --> 00:46:57,769
better. That's like a mad Mario character. This piece of shit's not tuned. This piece of shit's

168
00:46:57,769 --> 00:47:12,820
out of tune. That's what it was. This is really fun. Okay. What else is there? Is it this one?

169
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:23,510
Long Tail Limbo. Let's do it. Let's just do them all. Empty your spit valve.

170
00:47:23,510 --> 00:48:58,070
Oh. What is this? Is this like Beethoven? Dude, Mozart was fucking lit. Don't ever say that word

171
00:48:58,070 --> 00:49:12,489
again. Okay. Don't ever say that word again. All right. What about this? I want to do them all

172
00:49:12,489 --> 00:49:19,340
before we do anything else. You know what I mean? Why not? What was Mozart's last word?

173
00:49:38,440 --> 00:50:48,780
I had to get a Super Mario in there. That wasn't me. I didn't do that. I got an S on that one.

174
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:54,119
Actual fart. All right. One more. One more and then we'll go back and see what else we can do.

175
00:50:54,119 --> 00:50:59,960
Professional trombone can cost over two billion. That's not even real.

176
00:51:50,179 --> 00:52:47,530
That's gotta be an S. I was gonna say it has to be, right? It has to be. All right. So what else

177
00:52:47,530 --> 00:53:00,789
can you do? Block. Jesus. Okay. What do I do? Collect? Welcome to your collection. Play the

178
00:53:00,789 --> 00:53:04,630
main game to earn toots and then spend them on trombone cards. Can you collect all 50?

179
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:33,820
I've not done that. What? This is crazy. It's cards? What is this? Can I play with them or

180
00:53:33,820 --> 00:54:09,030
something? This is so cool. This is so cool. This is not what I thought it was going to be,

181
00:54:09,030 --> 00:54:18,300
by the way. This is like actually just collect interesting cool history on the trombone. That's

182
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:32,099
cool. You could eat up to 30. Wait, they're fake? Composer of more than 600 pieces. Mozart,

183
00:54:32,099 --> 00:54:35,619
one of the most well-known classical composers of all time. He could eat up to 30 hot dogs in

184
00:54:35,619 --> 00:54:46,329
one sitting. Oh, it's made up. Oh, maximalist electronic composer and producer of bespoke soups.

185
00:54:46,329 --> 00:54:49,369
In addition to long tail limbo, he produced a trio of critically acclaimed albums,

186
00:54:49,369 --> 00:54:57,480
which you should purchase immediately. American jazz trombonist who played with

187
00:54:57,480 --> 00:55:02,039
Count Bassey was known for his plunger mute technique and literally wrote a book on plunger

188
00:55:02,039 --> 00:55:08,980
techniques. As an American, he probably ate a ton of hot dogs. What's a hot dog thing?

189
00:55:08,980 --> 00:55:15,909
Why? What's with the hot dogs? Oh, we already got Roswell all wrote already, right? Legendary

190
00:55:15,909 --> 00:55:23,219
tromboner and composer who worked in free and avant-garde jazz taught ethnomusicology performed

191
00:55:23,219 --> 00:55:28,500
with Malian and Mongolian musicians and could eat 900 hot dogs. What's with the hot dogs?

192
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:47,190
Whether or not he ate hot dogs is unknown. He ate, only ate hot dogs in private. One of the most

193
00:55:47,190 --> 00:55:53,269
powerful tromboner cards, the red eyes black baboon is a representation of the bass clef

194
00:55:53,269 --> 00:56:02,019
as it relates to Babi, the Egyptian deification of the sacred old world Hamadryas baboon. Did I get

195
00:56:02,019 --> 00:56:14,300
it? Favorite clef of the primordial baboon toot-seeker tom. This clef represents light,

196
00:56:14,300 --> 00:56:27,079
but there can be no light without dark. This has got to be some kind of inside joke with the devs,

197
00:56:27,079 --> 00:56:44,789
right? He ate hot dogs sometimes, maybe. J.S. Bach invented the hot dog. The air horns are killing

198
00:56:44,789 --> 00:57:25,590
me. What is a turd? A coward's trombone. Double his power level. He's a master of orchestration

199
00:57:25,590 --> 00:57:39,539
and could eat a whole lot of hot dogs, although. Okay, let's just boom, open them. A glissando is

200
00:57:39,539 --> 00:57:44,179
a slide from one tone to another. The trombone is one of the few instruments capable of performing

201
00:57:44,179 --> 00:57:57,820
a true smooth glissando. This is, wait, 16th century Italian painter who painted what may

202
00:57:57,820 --> 00:58:14,579
have been the first artistic depiction of a woman playing a trombone. Oh shit, there it is. It is

203
00:58:14,579 --> 00:58:29,800
the alpha and the omega. Why? The trombones of the animal kingdom and are the descendants of Babi,

204
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:34,920
the bull of the baboons, who is a relative of the primordial baboons that watch over the twin toot

205
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:44,280
vessels. Legendary Jamaican Scott trombonist with a true history of mental illness and murder,

206
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:48,550
ultimately ending with his death at Bellevue Asylum in Kingston. Jeez.

207
00:58:58,099 --> 00:59:02,340
Honestly, I thought that was Milhouse Manastorm for one second. I was like,

208
00:59:02,340 --> 00:59:07,940
that's a funny joke. They put Milhouse Manastorm in here and they did. That's what the joke is.

209
00:59:07,940 --> 00:59:13,139
That's what the joke is. I didn't read further than that. That was what the reference is.

210
00:59:14,659 --> 00:59:24,599
I'm an idiot. Okay, Mozart music storm. This Austrian mage holds the key to the ear wing

211
00:59:24,599 --> 00:59:36,489
of tempo keep. He will light you up with the sound of his sweet keys. Cool. Ancient Egyptian Babi.

212
00:59:39,050 --> 00:59:59,780
I've got like five Roswell ruds. Very cool. Wait, should I do it like a Hearthstone pack opening?

213
01:00:09,219 --> 01:00:22,630
Guys, okay. So we're looking for epics or legendaries. It's not here. What is this one?

214
01:00:23,030 --> 01:00:33,429
Oh, all right. That's all right. That's a good one. That's okay. Very cool. This I could use

215
01:00:33,429 --> 01:00:44,440
this in my I could use this in my in my warlock deck. I think what's under this one. You know,

216
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:50,119
I what I really want is I really hope that and by the way, this this takes like four hours to open

217
01:00:50,119 --> 01:01:05,099
like 50 packs just in case you were wondering. Oh, okay. It's not it's it but it's close to

218
01:01:05,099 --> 01:01:25,559
Mozart Manastorms. All right, come on. You always have to go somebody else click the button so I

219
01:01:25,719 --> 01:01:47,559
can stay like this. Oh, do finger snaps. What is that? What is finger snaps?

220
01:01:47,559 --> 01:01:56,380
Do people do finger snaps when they open packs? What did I do when I opened like crates in TF2?

221
01:01:56,380 --> 01:02:16,409
What did I do? Did I do that? Did I go like this? I think I think I did. I did. Yeah, I actually did.

222
01:02:17,130 --> 01:03:02,519
All right. So what else is there? Free improvisation. What is this? I don't understand.

223
01:03:02,519 --> 01:03:33,909
I'd play music. I don't know how to play music. That's a sound effect in a Chrono Trigger or

224
01:03:33,909 --> 01:03:41,420
something. What is that? It's a it's a move in Chrono Trigger or my RPG or something.

225
01:03:41,420 --> 01:03:58,059
You doy doy doy. That's a mega. Oh, you got it. Thank God. I was gonna drive me crazy for the

226
01:03:58,059 --> 01:04:09,800
next two weeks. It's the Mega Man charge up sound. They're like, dude, it real. Oh my thank God.

227
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:17,670
Thank you so much. That would have drove me nuts. Wait, I have to do it. I have to do it right,

228
01:04:17,670 --> 01:04:34,139
though. I have to do it right. Otherwise, I won't be able to go to sleep. It's like it's slower.

229
01:04:35,320 --> 01:04:47,099
Don't go so high. All right. I'm going to people going to leave. That's like annoying.

230
01:04:47,099 --> 01:04:55,110
All right. Kirby. Yep. What's the hardest song in the game?

231
01:05:00,760 --> 01:07:02,599
Crunchy. Very cool. All right. There's still more Trombone Skies. Let's go. Oh,

232
01:07:03,559 --> 01:09:23,739
there's more to the songs. All right, we're good. I didn't blow it, right? Did I blow it?

233
01:09:24,380 --> 01:09:49,659
Yeah, I'm good. Hell yeah. Let's go. Go back to Baboon. Go back to do it again. Click Baboon in

234
01:09:49,659 --> 01:10:34,760
the menu. What the fuck is this? Are are thou the one who's been knocking on my little hatch?

235
01:10:34,760 --> 01:10:45,109
Yes. Okay. I stick the Trombone champ. Is there a design wish to become the champ? Yes.

236
01:10:45,270 --> 01:10:55,779
Yes. Primordial Baboon. Toot Seeker Tom. Feast eyes on the toot vessel.

237
01:10:59,739 --> 01:11:03,260
What is it for? How does this affect my life personally? These are questions for which I

238
01:11:03,260 --> 01:11:12,939
have long since forgotten answers. My bad. Feed it toots. Okay. I spent all my money on card packs.

239
01:11:13,500 --> 01:11:25,239
Why did I do that? It's framped. Seek the Lord Vessel. Come back to me and feed me items.

240
01:11:25,239 --> 01:11:44,170
You must succeed Lord Gwyn. All right. I spent all my money on card packs. That was dumb. All

241
01:11:44,170 --> 01:11:53,449
right. Well, now I have to do it. I have to get it. I want to do every song I haven't done.

242
01:11:53,449 --> 01:12:13,159
Fingers are cramping up. I thought this was. I thought this was the.

243
01:12:13,560 --> 01:14:02,710
Hold on. I can't concentrate. Are you so red? Because I'm red. I don't know. I'm very flushed.

244
01:14:02,710 --> 01:14:17,560
Did we do all the songs? Wait. This one is. This one's pretty crazy. Let's do an easy one.

245
01:14:17,560 --> 01:15:31,850
We're gonna do an easy one. Hold on. Isn't this. Oh, wait a minute. Isn't this. Yeah, it's the same

246
01:15:31,850 --> 01:16:05,939
song. We stole that song. All right. Skybird. Beans on toast? No way. What's that old Nickelodeon

247
01:16:05,939 --> 01:16:19,340
show? Kablam? It's Ka-Blam. That's what this sounds like to me. That song was fucking awesome,

248
01:16:19,340 --> 01:18:51,979
by the way. I like this a lot. I lost it a little bit there. Strawberry Magic 2 Waiting Room. True.

249
01:18:51,979 --> 01:19:09,109
No, you. Everybody hated that. There was a huge chat war from that game. All right. That was fun.

250
01:19:09,109 --> 01:19:14,039
All right. There's only a couple I haven't done. How about this one? I don't know the names of

251
01:19:14,039 --> 01:19:18,500
these songs, but I recognize every single one of them. I look at them and I go, what is that?

252
01:19:18,500 --> 01:21:34,760
And then I. You can do that? Never mind. All right. I was trying to see if I could

253
01:21:35,399 --> 01:21:45,100
chain them together. I still got an ass. Who cares? All right. Let me do the one song I haven't done.

254
01:21:45,819 --> 01:21:54,010
Oh, it's not this too. All right. Okay. Come on. This one's going to be crazy. I'm ready.

255
01:21:54,010 --> 01:23:23,079
Why don't you ever blink? Good luck blinking during this. Oh, oh, that was cool. I like that

256
01:23:23,079 --> 01:23:37,989
one. Blink. I have your stream muted. Well, I hope you're playing along with sheet music or something

257
01:23:37,989 --> 01:23:50,710
because I don't know how you're watching. All right. I got this one. Blink once. You're going

258
01:23:50,710 --> 01:25:40,279
to go crazy. I'm fine. I'm paying attention. Now I can blink. You give me one button,

259
01:25:40,279 --> 01:25:44,329
you give me two buttons, give me three buttons. You give me up to four and I'll be fine.

260
01:25:44,329 --> 01:25:52,039
Once we cross four buttons, I can't do anything. Give me a, you give me four buttons and I will

261
01:25:52,039 --> 01:26:09,079
destroy it. Is this the only one we haven't done? How good are you at guitar hero? How many buttons

262
01:26:09,079 --> 01:26:24,649
are on the guitar hero controller? Sorry. I don't play guitar hero very well at all. I cannot do

263
01:26:24,649 --> 01:26:35,750
the fifth button in guitar hero. I can't do it. Is this why you played arcane mage? And wow,

264
01:26:35,750 --> 01:27:49,779
that is such like an insane detailed insult. I thought I got an F. I thought I got an F.

265
01:27:49,859 --> 01:28:00,979
Just play guitar hero on medium. No, I can't play it on medium. Oh, there's another one.

266
01:28:02,390 --> 01:28:09,319
Old gray mirror. Not a real American, not a perfect score.

267
01:28:13,140 --> 01:29:46,090
I was taking a sip. I was drinking my drink. Oh, that was nice. Imagine waiting for the weekend

268
01:29:46,090 --> 01:29:51,579
Breath of the Wild stream and he just plays Snore Rancher 2 and Fart Simulator.

269
01:29:51,579 --> 01:30:05,130
I'm playing Breath of the Wild in like half an hour. I think that's it, but it's not. I'm not

270
01:30:05,130 --> 01:30:10,619
done. That's all the songs, right? Wait, let's go pay the trombone. The trombone thing.

271
01:30:12,260 --> 01:30:23,800
All right. Is it trombone? It's trombone. Trombone. It's trombone. Snore Rancher. Yeah,

272
01:30:23,800 --> 01:30:46,010
come on, man. It's trombone. Trombone or trombone? Trombone. Trombone. Trombone. Yeah,

273
01:30:46,010 --> 01:30:54,359
trombone. Not trombone. The trombone. Maybe I guess you can say it either way, right?

274
01:30:54,359 --> 01:31:12,260
Jesus. It awakens. New instrument.

275
01:31:25,689 --> 01:31:38,840
Probably gone. Oh, I can do it again.

276
01:31:55,000 --> 01:32:01,609
So I have to do this three times because look at where it's filled up.

277
01:32:21,130 --> 01:32:36,220
Oops. Mute the game. I got to do it one more time. I got to get asked on something. I got

278
01:32:36,220 --> 01:32:54,090
to do it one more time. Wait, muted. It's an instrument. Hold on. Let me try. So there's no

279
01:32:54,090 --> 01:34:24,699
sounds. Sounds like chaos. What's his name? Animal Crossing. Slider. Did I miss one note?

280
01:34:24,699 --> 01:34:48,649
KK Slider. Yeah. Should I get an S on the warm up? I want to unlock one more thing at least.

281
01:34:48,649 --> 01:35:24,859
Play as the new character. Oh shit. Okay. Do it again. I can do it perfect. I got to do it

282
01:35:24,859 --> 01:36:46,539
perfect. What's going on? I didn't miss a single note. All right. So that's, that's perfect. I

283
01:36:46,539 --> 01:36:55,579
didn't miss a single one. Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.

284
01:36:56,300 --> 01:37:08,649
All right. How many points do I need? 2,500, right? All right. It's going to jump scare

285
01:37:08,649 --> 01:37:23,260
everybody. Just be ready. Be aware. One more. The game looks fun. It is. Do the new character,

286
01:37:23,260 --> 01:37:45,779
new character. All right. All right. Where's, oh, all right. I need more points. What was that

287
01:37:45,779 --> 01:37:58,380
really cool one that we liked? What was that? What was the really cool one? Oh yeah. This one.

288
01:38:03,479 --> 01:38:08,140
Yeah. This one. Wait, am I going to get points for doing this? I already got an S on it.

289
01:38:08,140 --> 01:40:33,319
Do you get points if you completed something and you do it more? All right. Fuck that. I thought

290
01:40:33,319 --> 01:40:43,289
the song was over. Sorry. That's better than the last time. Way better than the last time.

291
01:40:44,170 --> 01:42:59,829
How come you're not singing the song? All right. Oh, oh, Langstein. Oh, Langstein. I wasn't ready

292
01:42:59,829 --> 01:43:19,319
for this solo. That's better than the last time. Please blink. I'm fine. I'm blinking. All right.

293
01:43:19,319 --> 01:43:42,149
Do I have enough points? He's a lizard. Wake up. I was a lizard. I'm just going to make,

294
01:43:42,149 --> 01:43:47,750
I'm going to clear the record here. If I was a lizard, I would not be streaming. I'll be

295
01:43:47,750 --> 01:44:02,979
lying outside on a fucking rock with my eyes just closed 14 to 15 hours a day, right in the sun.

296
01:44:02,979 --> 01:44:18,569
You look like Shaggy. I know because I'm wearing a green shirt. It's a solid green shirt. You just,

297
01:44:18,649 --> 01:44:26,779
you're Shaggy, I guess. Every time I wear this, people say Shaggy.

298
01:45:04,180 --> 01:45:12,409
Eight bit. Oh, that's actually kind of cool. There's more. All right. I want to do that.

299
01:45:12,409 --> 01:45:24,699
That sounds fun. I know I said I was going to play Breath of the Wild, but I want to hold on.

300
01:45:24,699 --> 01:45:46,439
I'm not done. I can click on something here. Build card. Turd card. Wait, don't I? Oh,

301
01:45:46,920 --> 01:46:13,590
these are my doubles. Should you ever have more than two? The chaos candle.

302
01:46:13,590 --> 01:46:53,510
You're playing the clout chaser game. I'm having fun, man. That's a fun game. That's my legendary

303
01:46:53,510 --> 01:47:42,699
trombone card. Oh, this is how you, okay. Silver trombone. So let's do it again.

304
01:47:42,699 --> 01:48:29,100
Man. Let's go. That's got to be fastest ever. That's the fastest ever. I don't think anyone's

305
01:48:29,100 --> 01:49:17,829
done it faster than that. Wait, what? No. Shit. I need, I just want to see what it looks like.

306
01:49:17,829 --> 01:49:50,649
I want to see what it sounds like. All right. Let's do it. Let's do eight bit.

307
01:50:16,039 --> 01:53:27,829
Why is your face crooked? I don't know. Blame God. I didn't get S. I started over. I fucked it up

308
01:53:27,829 --> 01:53:30,710
and I got all fucked in my, I got all fucked up in my head and my head got all fucked up.

309
01:53:30,710 --> 01:54:46,149
Let's do it again. I'm going to try space bar. No, that's, that's scratching your head and

310
01:54:46,149 --> 01:56:36,329
rubbing your stomach at the same time. A little bit bad. I got at least an A. It was a B before

311
01:56:36,329 --> 01:56:44,819
I got an A. All right. I want to take the eight bit sound effects off because it kind of hurts

312
01:56:44,819 --> 01:56:54,680
my head. All right. We've got to get at least A, right? Entertainer. I got to get at least an A

313
01:56:54,680 --> 01:59:56,970
and everything. That would have been an A. One more try and that's it. That's A. I think that's

314
01:59:56,970 --> 02:00:05,079
it, right? Any more B's? No, I got all A's and S's. That's it. Can I afford anything else?

315
02:00:24,729 --> 02:00:51,380
I can go higher than that. Not enough. I got an A on this. I got it. The ones that are easy,

316
02:00:52,180 --> 02:01:00,359
I should be able to get S's on, right? Let me go back to this one. Seriously. Like I can do this

317
02:01:00,359 --> 02:01:05,899
one. I screwed this one up big time. Here we go. I'm definitely going to get at least a better

318
02:01:05,899 --> 02:01:51,779
score on this one. My finger hurts. I'm so mad. My, my finger started to like, I was like made of

319
02:01:51,779 --> 02:02:02,119
a stone. I couldn't click. Use the keyboard. I can't. I have to use my right hand. You know

320
02:02:02,119 --> 02:02:07,159
what? When you do, when you move too many times, it's like doing reps. The lactic acid like builds

321
02:02:07,159 --> 02:05:29,739
up and it's just, I can't click anymore. 160 second break. My fucking finger hurts. Oh,

322
02:05:29,739 --> 02:05:36,310
you just can't, man. No, you got to start with, you got to start with that one. I got a better

323
02:05:36,310 --> 02:05:51,539
score. I got a better score. That's fine. It's the like, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, and having to click

324
02:05:51,539 --> 02:06:08,539
and move. All right. What about, um, how about this one? I'm going to get this one to S. Take a break.

325
02:06:08,539 --> 02:07:58,039
I'm a gamer. I can. That's an S right? Yes. All right. One more. That's it. One more and I'm done.

326
02:08:03,020 --> 02:09:21,109
I thought it was going to be different than that. Start. Good start. Is that better than the last

327
02:09:21,109 --> 02:09:30,119
one? Not by much. Fuck. It's all right. When you, it's just the, you know what I mean?

328
02:09:31,159 --> 02:09:34,739
All right. Let me unlock my thing and then I'm going to switch to Breath of the Wild.

329
02:09:34,739 --> 02:10:43,399
What do you do with that? I got everything out of that. What do we do with the key? Oh,

330
02:10:43,399 --> 02:11:04,180
there's one more secret. Okay. I'll do it. Click this a bunch. I would have never figured that out.

331
02:11:23,829 --> 02:11:47,659
Am I going to get a tuba? Okay. I just wanted you, I wanted you to give me the secret. I

332
02:11:47,659 --> 02:12:12,840
didn't want you to leave. Yeah. All right. You said that.

333
02:12:13,399 --> 02:13:10,460
Should Bassmaster Ben not stop in stopping the story? Did he not stop? Yes. Not. No.

334
02:13:10,460 --> 02:13:30,550
The toot vessel and the turd vessel. Toot master Tom. I feel like that's, I feel like that's like

335
02:13:30,550 --> 02:13:35,850
a hacker name in Dark Souls. I get invaded by that. It's like, okay, he's going to, he's

336
02:13:35,850 --> 02:13:41,529
going to crash my computer. I got to be careful. There's like fucking toot master Tom or like turd,

337
02:13:41,529 --> 02:14:19,899
turd vessel Tom. All right. Okay. I got the key though. Can I put the key somewhere?

338
02:14:22,920 --> 02:14:27,560
Do you not want me to not repeat this full tale again or should I not simply continue?

339
02:14:28,439 --> 02:14:33,420
Just tell me the answer. I don't even care. It's yes, right?

340
02:14:33,420 --> 02:14:55,539
Build a vessel with turds. I don't have any turds. How do I get turds?

341
02:15:03,859 --> 02:15:23,289
I have to dust cards. Oh, really? Should I just turd everything? Things I have doubles of?

342
02:15:23,930 --> 02:16:16,500
This duplicates. Okay. Okay. So I gotta get some more packs, right? Okay. Cool. Any doubles?

343
02:16:17,140 --> 02:16:47,750
Do you have enough turds? Yeah, but I'm going to need, I'm probably going to need to do it more

344
02:16:47,750 --> 02:17:56,790
than once, right? Only do it, I don't have to do it once. Sound set in the club. I kind of,

345
02:17:56,790 --> 02:18:25,700
I kind of need to do that. I'm just saying the amount of omega lulls that I've seen in the last

346
02:18:25,700 --> 02:18:34,889
one straight minute that you tell me that my fart joke about farting like this star spangled

347
02:18:34,889 --> 02:18:43,219
banner or something or like the fart thing with Holly that I'm, but I'm so, I'm so low brow,

348
02:18:43,219 --> 02:18:46,840
apparently. Count the amount of omega lulls in the last one minute.

349
02:19:18,520 --> 02:19:24,139
I don't want to hear it. I don't want to hear it from anybody. I want, I want the,

350
02:19:24,860 --> 02:19:28,700
I want the mods to keep track of every chatter that omega lulls in the next

351
02:19:29,500 --> 02:19:39,579
five minutes. I want you to keep track of every omega lull you see in the next five minutes

352
02:19:39,579 --> 02:21:35,319
and then time them out for an hour. How many people are getting timed out? It was a lot.

353
02:21:43,750 --> 02:24:36,309
It was including Twitch staff. Oh, fatigue is setting in. Oh, okay. That's better. All right.

354
02:24:36,870 --> 02:24:50,920
I only, I want enough to unlock all the turds. All right, let's do one more. Only one more.

355
02:24:50,920 --> 02:25:42,389
Just one more, one more, one more. Everyone relax. One more. Shut up. I did it. Perfect.

356
02:27:26,379 --> 02:27:48,200
Well, 2.2 million dollars. Come on. That's gonna be better. It was a little bit better.

357
02:27:48,200 --> 02:28:08,010
Oh my God. I forgot to blink. Look at this. Holy shit. Jesus. Oh, all right. What do we,

358
02:28:08,010 --> 02:28:54,059
what do we got? Do I have enough? I'm just going to sell a lot of these. All right. What if I just

359
02:28:54,059 --> 02:29:35,159
sell all of them? I need 750, 750, which is what? 1500. I need 1500. I'm close. I might just get it.

360
02:29:36,040 --> 02:30:24,659
Can we omega all of these turds? Yeah, that's fine. So what is it?

361
02:30:40,120 --> 02:30:54,340
Character, servant of Bobby. Okay. That's pretty cool. You know what I really wish was in this

362
02:30:54,340 --> 02:31:00,409
game? And I know it's probably impossible, but there's probably so much money. But

363
02:31:00,409 --> 02:31:10,329
imagine this was licensed games, not licensed games, licensed music. I feel like that would

364
02:31:10,329 --> 02:31:28,360
be really, really funny. It'd be really cool. I think it's funny. There are mods for custom

365
02:31:28,360 --> 02:31:49,020
songs. All right. That's really cool. I have a blue key and a red key. So what do I do with

366
02:31:49,020 --> 02:32:01,319
the two keys? Okay. So I, I did everything with the turds. Now you are ready. You will need a

367
02:32:01,319 --> 02:32:14,940
power level of 10 before combating the forces of order. Really? I have two keys now. How do I get

368
02:32:15,739 --> 02:32:43,979
shit? The candle is the last one. Oh shit. You dare challenge me? Prepare thyself,

369
02:32:43,979 --> 02:32:54,709
tromboner. What's going on?

370
02:34:45,399 --> 02:34:51,340
You must yield the horn of legend. I must have a power level of at least 10

371
02:34:57,719 --> 02:35:08,250
Okay. So you have to come here with the legendary trombone and beat it. Okay. That's cool. Um,

372
02:35:08,250 --> 02:35:16,520
I think I'm done. You got to unlock everything. I don't know if I'm going to unlock everything.

373
02:35:17,239 --> 02:35:25,319
My God, it's got chills up my whole spine. You never turned baboons up in the options.

374
02:35:26,340 --> 02:35:35,020
Oh, I didn't. Yeah, that's true. That boon quality inferno, a boon preference, all of them.

375
02:35:35,979 --> 02:35:52,819
Let me see what that does. I'm just curious. What the fuck is this? Is there more songs? Is

376
02:35:52,819 --> 02:36:18,940
that a secret song? What was that? Where did that go? Where did that just go? If we go again. I'm,

377
02:36:18,940 --> 02:36:50,360
I'm not even playing. All right. Goodbye. That was a really cool game. Fun game. Liked it a lot.

378
02:36:50,360 --> 02:36:57,129
Very good. I would say it's a quality experience. Very fun. That was really cool. I liked it a lot.

379
02:36:57,770 --> 02:37:03,610
I'm glad I played it. All right. Now, sorry, I slapped in your head. We're going to play

380
02:37:03,610 --> 02:37:07,850
Breath of the Wild. I'm going to go take a piss break, make sure I get the switch set up correctly

381
02:37:08,569 --> 02:37:25,879
back in like two, three minutes. See you soon. Be right back. Just kidding. Okay. Now I'll be back.
