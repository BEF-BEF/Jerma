1
00:00:03,509 --> 00:00:09,640
Hey, sorry everybody. My cat rolled all over my Twitch computer.

2
00:00:10,839 --> 00:00:15,929
And my cat, I have a piano that's over here that's hooked up to the screen,

3
00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:21,320
and my computer cat walked over the piano. I didn't mean to turn the stream on.

4
00:00:23,379 --> 00:00:34,679
Good morning, how are you? So yeah, it's early. I'm, I was up late last night,

5
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:41,579
uh, preparing for this exact moment. Um, I know a lot of you probably really

6
00:00:42,539 --> 00:00:47,560
confused as to why there's a stream right now. Uh, I'm participating in Ludwig's

7
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:56,229
Super Auto Pets Tournament. That's right. In a game that I have a collective

8
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:04,420
hour and 12 minutes in the game. I'm gonna get fucking annihilated.

9
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:20,859
I was cramming for an exam. Yeah, I was up late last night because it's like,

10
00:01:20,859 --> 00:01:24,379
oh man, that game looks really cute and really fun. It's what a cool looking game.

11
00:01:25,099 --> 00:01:32,379
I saw Ludwig play it and I saw other people playing it too. Uh, and then late last night,

12
00:01:32,379 --> 00:01:39,459
I found myself saying, you know what? Yeah, I think it's time to cram for that exam that I

13
00:01:39,459 --> 00:01:46,629
told Ludwig I would be in like a week ago. So I watched the Northern Lion Tier List.

14
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:58,659
You know, just trying to get an idea. I played for a little while. I actually,

15
00:01:58,659 --> 00:02:03,299
this is not a joke. I'm making the, this is not me making something up. This is for real.

16
00:02:03,939 --> 00:02:11,460
I fell asleep last night with Northern Lion telling me how good and bad things were

17
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:22,460
the different animals while I was sleeping with the iPad on my chest. I was just sitting there

18
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:28,219
with iPad on chest listening to him. My eyes are closed and I open it up. I think the videos,

19
00:02:28,219 --> 00:02:34,939
it's like a two and a half hour video. I started the video. It was just like, fuck, I'm tired.

20
00:02:34,939 --> 00:02:39,740
This, I gotta, I gotta know though. I need to know. And I closed my eyes and I kind of woke up.

21
00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:43,979
It was, I think like an hour had gone by and he was still going through the list.

22
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:57,990
Well, I think I absorbed some info, but yeah, I'm very prepared to just be the,

23
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:07,960
the first enemy of level one for all the people playing in the tournament today.

24
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:18,900
His voice sounds so sleepy. Well, it's because I woke up 20 minutes ago. I literally rolled out

25
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:30,500
and got out here. I told you I was up all night studying. The reason why I'm live like 20 minutes

26
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:35,960
early is because I want to play around and everyone's, I look, I don't even care how bad

27
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:39,900
it from what he thinks I'm playing. I'm not, I can't even look at the chat because people are

28
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:46,039
going to be like, holy shit dude, you suck. You got, how fucking dumb are you? I think I just

29
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:58,099
barely learned what the, what the alligator did. That was about 15 minutes ago. Let me tweet this.

30
00:03:58,659 --> 00:04:09,500
Okay. Yeah, this is, this is, and this stream is only going to be as long as the tournament is.

31
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:14,969
You know, I actually kind of like the voice. I like having this voice. You know, you know,

32
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:18,329
you know how you wonder how does the guy on the radio sound like this?

33
00:04:19,129 --> 00:04:25,129
Well, it's because the guy on the radio is, it's about seven or eight AM and they, they have wake

34
00:04:25,129 --> 00:04:36,839
up voice and they use wake up voice to their advantage. See by noon, 12 o'clock Eastern,

35
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:47,540
by the way, this is gone. And those guys talk normally for the rest of the day. Sonic is the

36
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:52,420
funniest movie of the year. That's funny. That's like my favorite joke of 20 of 2020

37
00:04:53,139 --> 00:05:00,519
and nobody even voted for it. A nice hot voice, Andy.

38
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:12,490
Howard Stern hates me. Howard Stern. No, it's, it's, it's just being really close to a microphone

39
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:19,029
with a deep voice in a compressor. When you get really close to a microphone and you have a

40
00:05:19,029 --> 00:05:24,790
compressor on, what it does is it, it takes your voice in it and it just transports it into

41
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:29,589
everybody's minds. It's crazy what radio's done. You know, what's the next question? Uh, Phil.

42
00:05:35,139 --> 00:05:46,490
All right. No, I don't, no, I don't want to run a virus scan. I have to warm up. I'm not,

43
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:48,810
I actually don't even know how this is going to work, but we'll figure it out.

44
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:59,339
What is this exactly? All right. Let me show you what this is. It's a game we're going to learn

45
00:05:59,339 --> 00:06:11,899
together before the tournament. Why is my chat not even in dark mode? What? Okay. Here we go.

46
00:06:11,899 --> 00:06:24,360
I don't know. It's not, it's not back of me. I should, maybe I should. All right. Here we go.

47
00:06:26,889 --> 00:06:34,759
So this is super autopets. Yeah. Yes. You can see, you can see my name. My name. I know at this,

48
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:46,069
I'm not going to be able to play on this fucking account ever again, probably. Yeah. My name is

49
00:06:46,069 --> 00:06:56,730
Bert Ernie. Bert Ernie. This over here. All right. So this is, it's okay. You don't, uh,

50
00:06:56,730 --> 00:07:02,620
you ever play like auto chess? I haven't, but I played battlegrounds. Uh, Hearthstone

51
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:09,240
Battlegrounds is apparently very similar to this. And it is very similar, which if Hearthstone

52
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:20,579
Battlegrounds is just, uh, uh, team fight tactics, whatever it is, that how it works. You get in the

53
00:07:20,579 --> 00:07:27,290
game, you started with them. And by the way, I've got, I've got hats on his hats. It's gotta,

54
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:32,149
I gotta just make sure I keep an eye on this discord over here because I don't want to miss

55
00:07:32,149 --> 00:07:38,790
the call time. It's very cute. And it's okay. It's just like Hearthstone Battlegrounds, just like

56
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:46,199
probably team fight tactics. I saw, I was, you know, I'm, I'm, I'm like a reviewer. I check out,

57
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:51,939
you know, games that have come out that are new. And by that, I mean, I watched Ludwig play this

58
00:07:51,939 --> 00:07:54,339
and then I said, wow, that looks cool. And he said, Hey, do you want to play in a tournament?

59
00:07:54,339 --> 00:08:00,949
And I was like, sure. And then I realized that it was today. Okay. Uh, so it's just like,

60
00:08:00,949 --> 00:08:06,279
this is the attack. This is the heart of health. What did you study? I told you I fell asleep with

61
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:31,800
Northern lions tier list. I was on my own, my chest. No, I wasn't on my chest. Okay. All right.

62
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:41,460
I'm going to try. I just spilled coffee all over me. I'm not even fucking ready. Oh, all right.

63
00:08:41,539 --> 00:08:50,200
All right. Um, no, I'm not. I'm tired. I just woke up. Everybody relax. I'm laughing. I'm very

64
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:54,440
disheveled right now because I just dropped the hot coffee on my chest and I don't have any clothes

65
00:08:54,440 --> 00:09:05,960
on. I don't have clothes on. So I just burnt my chest. Okay. So you really want to get like a,

66
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:12,309
the pig sucks from what I hear, but they fight on their own. It's automatically right. So I'm

67
00:09:12,309 --> 00:09:17,110
going to let's just go with cricket. Everything costs three gold. That includes the food, which

68
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:22,629
is the sometimes give permanent buffs. Sometimes it gives something temporary. It's sometimes it

69
00:09:22,629 --> 00:09:30,710
might give, uh, health and I'm saying mana, but health and attack. So we've got a cricket, uh,

70
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:36,649
and rolling. You can roll is what she gets you other ones to choose from using the pay to lose

71
00:09:36,649 --> 00:09:48,309
pack. Why? I didn't know what the rules were. So I just got to get, you got to get stuff up there

72
00:09:48,309 --> 00:09:55,990
as, as, I mean, as Northern lion says, forget about being the big brain tech guy and go for wins.

73
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:59,509
Like, you don't, you don't tech into something, right? Like this is what I've been taught

74
00:09:59,509 --> 00:10:07,139
by the best, by the way. All right. So let's, uh, beaver's good beavers. All right. It's two, two.

75
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:11,860
Let's get another, uh, well, I've mosquitoes. Pretty good. Mosquito throws a mosquito dust at

76
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:23,500
somebody to start and you'll see how this works. Are you ready? Here we go. Uh, name your team. The

77
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:31,059
fishy lawnmowers. That's fine. No face cam. No way. So then I don't, I don't, I don't know how

78
00:10:31,059 --> 00:10:37,269
this works. I don't, I don't understand how the matchmaking works, but there's no time limit

79
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:43,639
like there is in Hearthstone. I killed that guy, got the hit there. That summons another cricket

80
00:10:43,639 --> 00:10:51,190
and then there you go. Automatically does it. And there's your first win. There's no audio.

81
00:10:51,190 --> 00:11:04,490
Oh, okay. Well, this should be no audio is broken. I got it. I got it. Okay. So you, if you lose,

82
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:10,860
you lose a heart and after turn three, if you lose, you lose three hearts. And I know what

83
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:15,019
you're thinking. I know what you look over time, over the course of like a few days, you get,

84
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:24,090
you get these back. Um, you can all, I'm just kidding. So the cool part about this is the reason

85
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:30,490
why I think it's cool. I like it. No, that's, it's just, that was a lie. Don't believe that.

86
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:36,419
That's literally that this game does not have, could not connect to server, but it's all right.

87
00:11:36,419 --> 00:11:44,460
Are you sick? Yeah. Let's just say yes. So if I have a cricket, I can upgrade this cricket by,

88
00:11:44,460 --> 00:12:13,980
oh, um, what happened? Did I get like banned? Oh, there we go. All right. Sick. Yeah. All right. So

89
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:23,820
I got a beaver. So, okay. So everybody has a certain thing that can happen, right? So when I

90
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:29,350
sell beaver, I do sound like fucked right now. So if I sell the beaver, he's going to give two

91
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:39,240
random people one health, but permanently, which is a big deal. Servers are bad. That's all right.

92
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:45,769
So I'm going to go, I, you know, I'm just going to fish. Win early, win early, win early, win early.

93
00:12:45,769 --> 00:12:54,860
That's what I've been told. Win early. I'm going to upgrade the beaver because if you do two,

94
00:12:54,860 --> 00:13:00,070
if you take a copy, put it on top of what you have there twice, bang, level it up.

95
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:09,639
Sell the beaver right now? Um, I don't know. And I'm going to lose the tournament. So don't

96
00:13:09,639 --> 00:13:18,570
worry. But this is really fun. The game's actually really fun. Um, I feel like that's a waste.

97
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:29,350
Oops. Well, it did it anyways, I guess. Okay. Uh, let's roll. Should I buy the food? No,

98
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:40,700
we're just going to fish. Going fish at the back. I can combine this after. Oh, you can free stuff

99
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:53,559
too. I probably should have froze the ant. Yeah. I have maybe an hour or two in this game

100
00:13:54,679 --> 00:14:01,340
and I'm going, I'm going up against like literally like the Galileo's of this game.

101
00:14:05,659 --> 00:14:23,669
No, it's not a drill. Oh, well you studied though. Yeah, I did. All right. So some of these are

102
00:14:23,669 --> 00:14:31,019
really, really cool. Like peacock, right? When a peacock gets hurt, it gets to attack. With

103
00:14:31,019 --> 00:14:38,500
porcupine dies, it does two damage to everybody. And the, uh, the dromedary.

104
00:14:48,379 --> 00:14:54,950
What am I doing here? What am I doing here? What am I doing here? I can't be in this. I

105
00:14:54,950 --> 00:15:00,149
can't do this. I'm going to get fucking beat the first round and I'm going to like burp at somebody.

106
00:15:04,539 --> 00:15:12,309
Okay. So, uh, stay calm, stay calm. All right. I'm going to stay calm. I'm relaxed. Yeah,

107
00:15:12,309 --> 00:15:25,370
I'm relaxing. I'm fine. I'm, I got confidence. I should be just fine. Okay. I think we're about

108
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:41,019
to start. Oh no. I thought I was going to have at least like 20 minutes. Oh shit. They said, hey,

109
00:15:41,019 --> 00:15:46,789
jump in the, jump in the general. Oh, okay. All right. I got to pretend like I'm not freaking out

110
00:15:46,789 --> 00:15:53,100
about this. You know what I mean? Like the battleship tournament was, I knew what I was doing.

111
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:57,100
I know the game very well. It was like, oh, German, look, we're going to do a battleship thing.

112
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:00,220
I have no idea what's going on right now. And I like have to, I have to put out the air

113
00:16:00,779 --> 00:16:21,299
that I, that I'm, I got it completely together here. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello.

114
00:16:25,529 --> 00:16:41,450
I'm so tired. When are we starting? What are you? Lud said we can be 10 minutes late. So I'm assuming

115
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:48,309
we're starting in 10 minutes. Okay. Cool. That's a freaking out. I just muted and deafened. I'm

116
00:16:48,309 --> 00:17:05,960
freaking out. All right. All right. Um, let's go. I got to finish at least this thing here. Everybody,

117
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:21,769
everybody is stoned. Okay. Let's go back to what I was doing. No more fucking around. All right. So

118
00:17:21,769 --> 00:17:27,990
when you combine, when you get to fish level two, they give everybody one, one, which is pretty good.

119
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:38,180
So, um, but I don't know if I want to do that right now. This will kill. Well, the word is faint,

120
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:46,710
right? You don't mute it. Just say it. Sell the beaver now. Yeah, that's actually a good idea.

121
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:55,720
But I, I can't get a over 10 gold, right? My mic is not, I, my mic is muted. Okay. I can see it

122
00:17:55,720 --> 00:18:11,140
over here. No, not muted to you guys. Muted to everybody else. It's in that call. Okay. Uh,

123
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:27,180
can I, what if I do this? Hear me out. So let's combine the fish and then do I want peacock?

124
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:43,640
I would anyone ever not put the hedgehog first because that hurts everybody. They're talking

125
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:51,670
about me. No, they're not. Ludwig is literally muted in here. I can see people. Should I pull

126
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:57,480
the head? You want to try it? Um, I don't even know what I'm looking for here. What do I want

127
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:04,869
to even try to do? Let's go peacock. When the peacock gets hurt, then you get, it's like a frenzy

128
00:19:04,869 --> 00:19:13,319
mode. All right. So let's keep the peacock back here. Unless I can get some food, which let's

129
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:31,460
roll for it. Hmm. Should I give her the cricket? Spider, spider is good. I think spider is just a

130
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:43,769
better cricket at this point. All right. So do I get, okay, do I get two spiders? Sell the beaver

131
00:19:43,769 --> 00:19:59,460
or should I just level up the spider or should I, uh, cupcake the, uh, peacock?

132
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:07,079
Sell the otter. Yeah, I'm going to, I'll do that. Let's do that. That's what I wanted.

133
00:20:07,079 --> 00:20:14,299
All right. We get two spiders. I don't want the shrimp. I do want this though,

134
00:20:14,299 --> 00:20:20,700
because this just adds, this is a, one of the buffs. Okay. It looks like every people are

135
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:32,779
trickling in. Ludwig's watching you. Yeah. But I mean, uh, honey. Okay. I want the honey as well.

136
00:20:32,779 --> 00:20:37,269
Having honey at the last person, the first like five rounds is incredibly important.

137
00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:46,920
Spider only, that's not how it works. Why do they have little hats on? I put them on.

138
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:59,220
Called me profoundly new, but no, you have no idea. I was up all night last night preparing

139
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:10,140
for this. I'm going, I'm going peacock, whale, cheetah. And it's going to, it's going to,

140
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:25,500
everyone's going to be in a lot of trouble. I just want a game. Oh, I like this one. Okay.

141
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:32,569
Bat is S tier. I know that for a fact. I know it for a fact. So I got, I got to, okay. I need

142
00:21:32,569 --> 00:21:44,630
to roll for a fish. I want bat. I want bat, but I want spider to have this because it's just five

143
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:49,910
more damage just permanently. And let's, it's taken off of course. All right. Let's give this

144
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:54,500
to you because that's just a win. Now what are we looking for? Excuse me. What are we looking for?

145
00:21:55,059 --> 00:22:09,160
I actually don't remember, but we're going to combine the spider. So now at the start of battle,

146
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:14,259
this makes somebody weak and all week is, it took me a while. It took me about a couple hours to

147
00:22:14,259 --> 00:22:20,299
figure this out. So weak is just a, like an equipment slot. You see on the right, it's a

148
00:22:20,299 --> 00:22:26,150
bone attack, attack for five more damage. Honey bee, summon a one, one bee after fainting, right?

149
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:33,190
It replaces that on anybody that it hits. They're starting. That's literally last night entry.

150
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:40,730
Jerma, why are people coming in my chat saying he's blazed? Who's saying that? I'm having like

151
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:44,569
people come in here talking about how you have ancient peyote that the lions used.

152
00:22:45,369 --> 00:22:50,549
Can I get some of that? I do not. I do not. I've just.

153
00:22:52,970 --> 00:23:00,309
That was very convincing. Well, look, the game, we have some beginners. Can you explain the rules,

154
00:23:00,309 --> 00:23:03,349
please? Like, I don't even know how the game works. I just installed it 15 minutes ago.

155
00:23:04,279 --> 00:23:11,259
So the game, very simply, is an auto battler. You form a team of five, the best team you possibly

156
00:23:11,259 --> 00:23:17,099
can. And the team will battle against a random person. So we're going to enter a 16 person lobby.

157
00:23:17,099 --> 00:23:22,329
Everybody in this call will be playing. And then the top eight people from that,

158
00:23:22,329 --> 00:23:26,730
from that giant group will go to a single elimination bracket. Just the sweaty people,

159
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:33,589
just the stans of the worlds. Okay. Let's relax. Let's relax. I'm here to have fun.

160
00:23:33,589 --> 00:23:38,390
We'll go to a different bracket. All right. A less sweaty one, the me youngs. Okay.

161
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:42,230
Aren't so good at games. I want to get rolled. I have a chance.

162
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:48,299
Why is that called that? Everybody gets. So the winner of each one will get their own award.

163
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:54,779
If you win the champion bracket, you get your own custom hat in game. It's a trophy hat.

164
00:23:54,779 --> 00:23:57,900
So you're the only person in the world who has it. If you win the losers bracket,

165
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:05,849
you get a joker hat. And then also four K for winner of champion two K for winner of losers.

166
00:24:08,119 --> 00:24:17,579
Is that all? That's pretty cool. What? I just want a hat. I just wanted a hat.

167
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:24,710
Yeah. The hat sounds amazing. So that's, that's pretty much it. That's pretty much it. This is

168
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:28,710
not sponsored by the people keep saying I'm sponsored because I keep playing this game.

169
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:32,309
It's mostly because there's this bald guy on Twitch that I've watched a decent amount lately.

170
00:24:32,869 --> 00:24:39,109
Hello. Oh, northern lion. Oh, I fell asleep to him last night.

171
00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:47,049
To help out, by the way, I have a discord channel for all of you

172
00:24:47,049 --> 00:24:50,920
because it doesn't make a lot of sense for all 16 of us to talk on a discord.

173
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:55,079
Uh, wait, that sounds fucking mean. That's not what I mean. Like, oh, hey,

174
00:24:55,079 --> 00:24:58,759
I fall asleep to you all the time, dude. No, no, no, no. I mean, like I was,

175
00:24:58,759 --> 00:25:01,640
I got to fucking correct that. I got to correct the record like right now,

176
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:06,119
but I can't like interrupt, right? Uh, and I, I predict if you win this,

177
00:25:06,119 --> 00:25:12,440
it'll go max like three, four hours. And if you lose right away, it'll go like 90 minutes to two

178
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:17,240
hours. How do I jump in and correct this? I didn't know I did. That was not like a,

179
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:21,079
Hey dude, like I fall asleep. I fell asleep to your stream last night. No, no, no, no, no, no,

180
00:25:21,079 --> 00:25:48,980
no. God, how do I, it's, it's too much time has passed. Nobody's talking. Uh, I caught the,

181
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:57,420
I didn't catch the last part. Uh, I said, okay, I didn't, this is going to be like a fun stream,

182
00:25:57,420 --> 00:26:01,779
but I'm like having a great time right now. Like I thought this is going to be like a game or

183
00:26:01,779 --> 00:26:06,740
stream where like, I got to focus. I got to really pay attention and no, no fun right now. I'm going

184
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:14,470
to, I'm trying to win. Point. Yeah. I should have, I should have clarified. I did forget about that

185
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:23,910
fact. Um, hold up, actually let me abandon this. Uh, so for this one, uh, everyone use the free pack

186
00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:30,069
just for the large group. That makes sense. Whatever you want. If you duckstrap your lame,

187
00:26:30,069 --> 00:26:37,990
just calling it out right now. I'm not going to do it. This is good. Call it duckstrap.

188
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:44,390
Do it. Don't do it. That's the duckstrap. My ducks for five turns and don't really use the DLC.

189
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:51,380
Don't leak my strats, bro. Well, I think, you know, there's no gift in the ducks. I've never

190
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:55,299
played this game and I'm probably going to get rolled because I don't even know what I'm looking

191
00:26:55,299 --> 00:27:05,079
at here. Is there like a tutorial that I can look at? I just, I just picked the cutest ones.

192
00:27:05,079 --> 00:27:10,519
Guys, I have no idea what I'm looking at here, man. I need like a tutorial or like a breakdown

193
00:27:10,519 --> 00:27:19,269
video. Kind of a little too late for that. Northern lion as we time to have a three hour long tutorial

194
00:27:19,269 --> 00:27:25,819
video. If you watch it on like 15 X, you might be able to digest it. Just go to Northern lion

195
00:27:25,819 --> 00:27:31,099
tierless super autopets, go to the very end and then just look at that and then buy the S tier.

196
00:27:31,099 --> 00:27:38,869
That's what I started. That's what I fell asleep to last night. I was lying there with the iPad

197
00:27:38,869 --> 00:27:43,829
on my chest just trying to cram for the exam and I got, I got to the, I was on the Northern lion

198
00:27:43,829 --> 00:27:52,650
video. I was like three, four o'clock in the morning. I put the playlist on and tried to

199
00:27:52,650 --> 00:27:58,089
absorb it while I slept. I don't, by the way, I think scientifically that doesn't work, Dan.

200
00:27:58,890 --> 00:28:02,890
Well, it looks like you're going to try again tonight and I'll put some more mid rolls in that.

201
00:28:03,609 --> 00:28:13,349
Good for the next week. See if it works. Oh, the lobby's up. All right. No, do lobby. Oh,

202
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:19,259
yeah. I'm adding. Was there any rules that I needed to know when I missed or

203
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:25,900
go for it? No, you're good. All right. Just pack one. Yeah. Flat pack one for the first round.

204
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:33,210
So pack. So we all jump. We're just doing the same. Yeah. Everybody can just kind of hop in.

205
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:43,319
Wait, how do I join? So you go to a private game join and then you type in the code I put in chat.

206
00:28:44,869 --> 00:28:50,069
It's because I didn't start at me. I kind of, I kind of reject. Make sure you don't leak. It's

207
00:28:50,069 --> 00:28:58,390
very easy to do it. Is it easy to leak? Yeah. Yeah. Join private and enter game name. Okay.

208
00:28:58,390 --> 00:29:04,150
Me young wins. She gets pretty good subs. Yeah. Don't say that. It's a rule. Okay.

209
00:29:05,779 --> 00:29:11,779
Should I join or am I just going to like capture your stream or like screen share or? Yeah. My idea

210
00:29:11,779 --> 00:29:17,640
was everyone will enter their own call and then screen share. So you can easily bounce around

211
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:28,140
watching POVs. Makes sense. Let me see how many people are in this. Ray is not streaming. I'm

212
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:32,150
going to get there in a second. He's like a spectator. Why is there 17? Oh, wow. This really

213
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:38,950
is super easy to leak. Yeah. It just shows that it's just there until it starts. So just say,

214
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:50,970
no, I did not leak. No, I did not 14. All right. So I think we're just missing

215
00:29:50,970 --> 00:30:00,490
Saikuno and mango and then we're set. Uh, and I think one person in this call hasn't joined.

216
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:12,170
Is that right? Um, I haven't joined, but one extra person in addition to you. Okay. Okay.

217
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:18,839
You know, there's a chance Northern line. I don't know how much you want to risk it.

218
00:30:18,839 --> 00:30:26,069
I don't think it'll go that long if you want to hop in and play. Here's the thing. Okay. I'm

219
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:31,430
there's two things. One is I already have a one of one hat in the game, so I wouldn't want to take

220
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:39,130
both of the one of ones. That's rude. And then the other one is I think my chat really has high

221
00:30:39,130 --> 00:30:43,529
expectations. They expect me to win. And that's a lot of pressure because there's a lot of good

222
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:49,289
players, a lot of good analytical thinkers here. So I would rather just sidestep the entire

223
00:30:50,410 --> 00:30:55,210
issue there and just commentate instead and act superior from an ivory tower. And then you

224
00:30:55,210 --> 00:31:02,089
won the champion, like in the end of Pokemon elite four. Hey, that could work. Whoever wins

225
00:31:02,089 --> 00:31:07,130
plays Northern line at the very end. That would be, it's like Pokemon. If every time that someone

226
00:31:07,130 --> 00:31:12,809
loses, you just say, Oh, they should have watched my tier list. I actually, the tier list is out

227
00:31:12,809 --> 00:31:19,769
of date with the new patch. Uh, I need to do a retcon, but I digress. Uh, Saikuno code is in

228
00:31:19,769 --> 00:31:25,220
general. Yep. I'm already in it. Does, does this code leak after the lobby? Is there some way to

229
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:28,420
hide on the screen? Once you go into the game, you're good. Once we're live, I think we're good.

230
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:47,339
Yep. Uh, I think, is this everyone? I'm missing three people. Unless I'm terrible at math. I

231
00:31:47,339 --> 00:31:55,779
feel like everybody in this call, if they joined, we would be at 16. I heard a distant whisper from

232
00:31:55,779 --> 00:32:06,099
five up. I did not know what he said though. I can mute. What are you saying? Wicked rude.

233
00:32:06,099 --> 00:32:12,660
What? Who me? I haven't even talked. Why am I wicked rude? I think I need another, I need

234
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:20,099
another coffee though, for sure. Yeah. The best part about like having, being a streamer that's

235
00:32:20,099 --> 00:32:25,750
in a call with a bunch of other streamers is like, I, I can just leave. I'll be back in like two,

236
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:32,660
three minutes. I think he was in the bathroom. I think he's going there. Okay. Okay. I'm sorry.

237
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:37,779
I grabbed it. Do I have time to grab a copy? Yeah, go for it. Anthony, you're in. Uh, yes, sir.

238
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:46,730
Yeah. Perfect. All right. Love that. Are you Alex? You're in. Yes, I am. Wonderful Buddha. Oh,

239
00:32:46,730 --> 00:32:57,289
there's 16. Oh, it was the pooping man. Uh, can you just join and then, um, do the old, uh,

240
00:32:57,289 --> 00:33:03,690
just drop from it. Oh, sure. Yeah. Yeah. No problem. Then it'll, it'll start when he joins.

241
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:07,849
I guess we should wait a moment. Uh, so after it starts, just hop in your own discord and then

242
00:33:07,849 --> 00:33:13,289
just discord screen share. You can just mute or deafen. I'm sure. Oh, discord screen share.

243
00:33:13,289 --> 00:33:18,490
And then that's just an easier way to spectate. Oh, I might've boned Jerma right there. All right.

244
00:33:18,490 --> 00:33:25,609
We're in. Oh, yeah. Let's get it. Do we restart? We might need a class restart because I did tell

245
00:33:25,609 --> 00:33:32,089
them to go get coffee and then I forgot it. Yeah, I didn't even. Yeah, back out. Yeah, back out.

246
00:33:32,089 --> 00:33:40,730
Yeah. More chances for ducks. Good thing I got bad RNG. I had three ducks, man. I had three.

247
00:33:41,779 --> 00:33:45,849
I'm actually not playing ducks because I hate them. We were abandoning, right?

248
00:33:45,849 --> 00:33:50,809
It's on principle. Yep. I respect that. Everyone's on the standard. Plus I get three.

249
00:33:50,809 --> 00:33:57,450
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We're leaving, right? Same. Good. Good. Wait, are we leaving? I love that.

250
00:33:57,450 --> 00:34:01,720
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Because Jerma's going to get coffee, right? Okay. Are we going to do some code?

251
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:05,559
It's going to do same code, but everyone can't join at once because if it starts again,

252
00:34:05,559 --> 00:34:09,019
we'll have the same problem. Right. So everybody's got to leave first.

253
00:34:09,019 --> 00:34:20,889
It's not letting me join the same code. Well, let's see. Well, yeah, I can't join either.

254
00:34:20,889 --> 00:34:33,619
No, we're just we're just waiting, I think. Yeah, you're good. So I've never played this before.

255
00:34:33,619 --> 00:34:40,099
Am I allowed to get help from chat or like, or is that like a no go? No, no, absolutely. Please do.

256
00:34:40,099 --> 00:34:45,750
Okay. All right, cool. Yeah, because I'm going to this blind man. I have no idea what I'm looking

257
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:50,469
at. I think a few people are going in blind and I think that's why we have the bottom bracket.

258
00:34:50,469 --> 00:34:54,550
So it's going to be it's going to be hilarious. It's going to be funny. It'll be good content.

259
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:58,869
I know we're going into you guys and it's going to be fine. We're going to get absolutely rolled

260
00:34:58,869 --> 00:35:03,190
by the pros, but that's okay. All right. New lobby code. Normal line. I don't need to join this one.

261
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:11,139
We'll commentate together and hop through. Understood. All right. So 11 a.m. is early.

262
00:35:11,139 --> 00:35:17,460
Is this what I'm understanding? Yes. It's late for me. It's late for you.

263
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:21,980
No, it's a joke, but I do wake up at like 9 a.m. right now.

264
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:23,980
Well, this guy's up at 4 a.m. in Japan.

265
00:35:26,579 --> 00:35:31,699
Just know that after last night and he's like, what time is it? I was like 11 hours from now.

266
00:35:31,699 --> 00:35:38,090
He's like, yeah, I'll just stay up. No, actually, I went to sleep for like four hours. Yeah, I had

267
00:35:38,090 --> 00:35:42,730
to. Wendy and I were awake at 7 a.m. and we're like, we shouldn't go to sleep. We're not going

268
00:35:42,730 --> 00:35:48,619
to wake up. Dude, I got two. I woke up to two flake messages from me, Young and Mango, both going

269
00:35:48,619 --> 00:35:54,380
like, hey, don't hate me, but I might not be there. I'm back. Sorry. I feel like I'm holding

270
00:35:54,380 --> 00:36:01,699
everybody up. I gave you my word. I didn't cook for the house to be here. I appreciate that.

271
00:36:02,579 --> 00:36:06,039
It's a nice afternoon here in New York. That's all I'm saying.

272
00:36:06,039 --> 00:36:12,389
Okay. Bad news. I think me on stream. Oh, she's back. Oh, I already lost a match.

273
00:36:12,389 --> 00:36:16,150
Maybe your internet. No, no, no. We had to we backed out for you so you can back out.

274
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:21,559
Oh, okay. New code. It's in general. We have three more people who need to join. We're good.

275
00:36:21,719 --> 00:36:28,679
Okay. Apparently Mango, because he's not on the call, was playing against bots.

276
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:34,500
He's like, wow, dude, so good. He literally said I was on a run.

277
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:49,159
So this is what happens when you win. Hello. Hello. Well, all right. I think we almost have

278
00:36:49,159 --> 00:36:54,500
everyone. We just need two more. Yeah. What's the win condition? Is it collecting a bunch of

279
00:36:54,500 --> 00:37:02,619
trophies like all the trophies? I think it's me young one and I don't know if there's mango

280
00:37:02,619 --> 00:37:12,659
for sure. So if you get all the trophies, that's like a win condition. Like what would you consider

281
00:37:12,659 --> 00:37:23,539
a win? So the way trophies in versus is it's lives and you will die and run out of lives.

282
00:37:23,539 --> 00:37:31,510
So you just need to live longer than the other people in this call. Okay, I see. I don't know

283
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:35,190
exactly how they calculate how many lives you get because I feel like it varies sometimes

284
00:37:35,190 --> 00:37:41,769
in the regular game mode. Would you guys consider up around one part, seven rounds to be good,

285
00:37:41,769 --> 00:37:46,199
like eight crowns to be good. What's, what's like, all right, that was a good, that was a good run.

286
00:37:46,199 --> 00:37:53,340
Yeah. Seven. It's good. Yeah. Seven. It's great. Yeah. So when I get like four under 10 personally,

287
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:58,059
but I can appreciate seven. What about, what about between like three and five? Is that considered

288
00:37:58,059 --> 00:38:02,940
okay? Well, I should get at least five. I'm sorry. Did you hit it with a higher number

289
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:09,849
and then count where you're at? I think one to four is the only bad ones because you should just

290
00:38:09,849 --> 00:38:14,949
play for, you should swing for the fences, right? Zero is better than four. So do you guys just

291
00:38:14,949 --> 00:38:18,389
leave game? Like do you just abandon game if you have? No, no, because then you get a dunce hat

292
00:38:18,389 --> 00:38:23,510
nowadays. They patch it. Oh. Yeah. The game makes fun of you if you abandon. So you have to play it

293
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:31,460
out like a hero. Wait, do I get a dunce hat if I already abandon them? No, if you abandon a bunch,

294
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:39,579
only pubs or something. All right. Yeah. The arena resetting for that perfect to triple fish.

295
00:38:39,579 --> 00:38:45,900
Damn, so knowledgeable. I think it's just me young. I think she's having some audio

296
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:51,960
and stream problems. It just F. Yeah. I'm also just downloading steam. So I need to say, yeah.

297
00:38:51,960 --> 00:39:08,780
I just said at least we know he has friends. Yeah. You're already wearing a dunce hat. I've

298
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:23,590
been wearing a dunce hat since at least 10 years ago. Okay. She played, see if they'll play among

299
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:32,019
us after this. Absolutely not. Only play Super Auto Pets on team. No, you can play on browser.

300
00:39:32,019 --> 00:39:38,010
Right. It's better to play on browser in my opinion. There's a browser. Yeah, there's a

301
00:39:38,010 --> 00:39:44,900
browser version. If you go to Teamwood games or whatever. The browser version. Hell yeah.

302
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:50,570
Where is that? I think it's teamwoodgames.com or just Google Super Auto Pets. Oh hell. They said,

303
00:39:50,570 --> 00:40:10,519
I don't know. Wait, what? Among us, among us. No. Play Farmville. Ask Ludwig to the winter formal.

304
00:40:10,519 --> 00:40:24,139
I can't tell if they're ignoring you. No, no, I'm muted. I'm unmuting when I have to ask

305
00:40:24,139 --> 00:40:36,409
somebody something. I'm not just talking over everybody right now. Will, is it just you at

306
00:40:36,409 --> 00:40:43,019
this moment? I have it. How do I join the game? Versus and then there's a code that Ludwig posted.

307
00:40:43,019 --> 00:40:49,699
Yeah. In Discord. Versus and then join private. Okay, got it. Yeah. And then just the name.

308
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:54,579
Oh, yeah. Don't say it out loud because people can just snipe it. Yeah. I'm definitely leaked.

309
00:40:56,469 --> 00:40:59,909
Go, Will. Go. It should be fine as long as Will joins in the next 13 seconds.

310
00:40:59,909 --> 00:41:05,829
Oh, are you in? Is that you, Will? I'm in. Okay, that's us. Perfect. All right. Everybody off to

311
00:41:05,829 --> 00:41:10,969
your own Discords. Okay. Own Discords. And then go live on Discord showing your perspective.

312
00:41:10,969 --> 00:41:15,369
Yo, good luck, guys. Good luck. Oh, you might have to pull me from my stream. You guys are

313
00:41:15,369 --> 00:41:19,929
going to need it, man. You're going to need it. Because they're about to get smacked, man. Okay.

314
00:41:19,929 --> 00:41:28,010
I can't do that. I'm on my phone. You're good. I'm not sure I can do that. And I have, like,

315
00:41:28,010 --> 00:41:34,409
program authority problems doing that for some reason. All right. Here we go. I'm ready. Are

316
00:41:34,409 --> 00:41:38,179
you guys ready? We're not on, like, a time limit or anything, but I don't want to be slow. So,

317
00:41:38,179 --> 00:41:50,519
hold on. Let me turn this up. All right. So, turn one. I, uh, all right. There is a timer.

318
00:41:50,519 --> 00:41:53,880
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. What do you see? Don't say that. Stop lying to me.

319
00:41:54,360 --> 00:42:11,110
Oh, did I do it? I didn't know there was a timer. What the fuck? This looks, I look so stupid.

320
00:42:12,070 --> 00:42:16,230
This is somebody that's never installed the game once. I can't fucking believe it.

321
00:42:17,750 --> 00:42:27,099
I didn't know there was a timer. Oh, God damn it. That's, uh, it's oh, it's over. Like, I've,

322
00:42:27,099 --> 00:42:33,769
I've fucked up everything. This is bad. This is really bad. Okay. Um, I didn't have a chance.

323
00:42:35,510 --> 00:42:39,110
Okay, sell. Give two random friends one health. All right. I have to have at least two people for

324
00:42:39,110 --> 00:42:50,710
this. Let's do bird again. And, um, beaver. Fuck. I'm so, I'm so thrown off. It's over.

325
00:42:50,710 --> 00:43:01,769
I'm on the wrong pack. Oh, Jesus. Oh, no. How am I able to play in the game?

326
00:43:01,769 --> 00:43:17,670
Okay. Why I have the wrong pack. This is, oh my God. I thought once we got into the game,

327
00:43:17,670 --> 00:43:29,610
it would be all right, but like I'm in the wrong pack. I may as well just fucking lose and just

328
00:43:29,610 --> 00:43:43,340
watch YouTube videos. Okay. So I don't know how I'm going to salvage this. I thought I was going

329
00:43:43,340 --> 00:43:49,829
to do okay, but this whole thing started like as such a disaster. All right, here we go. Um,

330
00:43:50,539 --> 00:43:53,980
I mean, does this really matter anymore? This is the worst team that's ever been put ever.

331
00:43:53,980 --> 00:44:04,179
What do I want? All right. We have, I have to at least go. I have to get something on somebody

332
00:44:09,059 --> 00:44:22,070
now. He's going to do seven damage. Uh, not the cat spider. I take so long to do these decisions.

333
00:44:22,070 --> 00:44:35,579
That's why I'm not used to the timer. Did you lose? Oh, absolutely. Like literally the first two,

334
00:44:35,579 --> 00:44:43,110
three turns. Like this is turn three and I live on discord. I don't think I can

335
00:44:43,110 --> 00:45:05,320
the way that, uh, after through OBS, it always screws up. Let me see if I can get it to work.

336
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:23,530
Is this going to work? Oh, not the webcam. Yeah. I can't, I can't get it to do my video.

337
00:45:25,340 --> 00:45:29,159
I've tried, I've tried this before. I'm going to be the first to be eliminated after this.

338
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:35,239
I just have to take this loss completely. Why am I throwing? I'm really not even trying to.

339
00:45:35,239 --> 00:45:44,460
I just like have the wrong pack and the missed the first two rounds. All right, here we go.

340
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:54,969
I need another. No, I don't think I can do the rat right now. Let me do this.

341
00:45:59,099 --> 00:46:17,300
So I get two peacocks. I think so. Okay. Well, this fish freeze fish and I got to move this.

342
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:25,829
So this is all right that I needed to be here. What do I want to have that attack you? Okay.

343
00:46:25,829 --> 00:46:33,909
All right. Let me see. Share my, let me try to, let me see if I can get it to work.

344
00:46:33,909 --> 00:46:52,570
Bind the fish. Yeah, I got a freezer mill. That first round just,

345
00:46:52,570 --> 00:46:59,030
Oh, that's actually really good. That's really good. That might be the save right there. No,

346
00:46:59,030 --> 00:47:24,539
definitely not. Unless I don't think so. No, too bad. I'm, I'm guaranteed to be the first person

347
00:47:24,539 --> 00:47:41,320
up. All right. Can I salvage this somehow? I'm sitting there talking like a dickhead and I'm,

348
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:51,820
I wouldn't, I wouldn't pay any attention to this. Oh, should I give? Okay. If I, okay. If I find

349
00:47:51,820 --> 00:48:04,949
another fish, then this is potentially salvaged. I'm going to give this to the peacock because

350
00:48:05,510 --> 00:48:12,900
garlic on the peacock is great because you want the peacock to get hit. All right. Give me fish.

351
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:16,820
This is good though. This, this is, this is really good. I'm going to, I have to get rid of somebody.

352
00:48:16,820 --> 00:48:21,539
I have to get rid of somebody, the spider, I think. I don't, I gotta get rid of the spider

353
00:48:21,539 --> 00:48:49,030
and I have to put this on behind the peacock. Well, the bird, the bird has the meat. Okay. All

354
00:48:49,030 --> 00:49:07,900
right. Come on. I got to pull this back. I'm gonna, I'm dead. It's not enough. That turn one, turn one

355
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:16,760
just killed me so bad. I can't. Well, okay. Now we're doing another one. We're doing more than one.

356
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:19,719
This is like, I'm going to fail the first one, obviously. All right. Here we go. Finally. All

357
00:49:19,719 --> 00:49:26,889
right. All right. This is important. I want to freeze you. I want to give the meat to somebody.

358
00:49:26,889 --> 00:49:32,840
All right. This is going to give one, one to everyone here. I'm going to, I gotta roll. I

359
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:46,619
gotta roll for something, for another peacock. Okay. Okay. All right. Look at that llama. If you

360
00:49:46,619 --> 00:49:54,730
have four or less pets, that's not going to work, but we're going to do this. Oh shit. Okay. I,

361
00:49:54,730 --> 00:50:00,119
I gotta get rid of somebody. Who do I get rid of? Probably the, the fish at this point needs to go

362
00:50:00,119 --> 00:50:06,500
and I'll replace fish with rooster. I think that's a play. And I'm going to give rooster the meat

363
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:21,289
bone. Oh, okay. Or the chicken, maybe. Chick behind the rooster. I, all right. I, I, who do I sell

364
00:50:21,289 --> 00:50:25,539
though? Who do I sell? Who do I sell the fish? Probably. Fuck. I don't have enough time to think

365
00:50:25,539 --> 00:50:33,400
about this. I have to sell the fish, put the rooster up, and then I don't want to save any

366
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:38,440
of these people. Okay. All right. All right. Hold on. Freeze you. And then, oh God. Oh my God. Oh

367
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:43,530
my God. Oh my God. Oh my God. Where do I go? Here. Here. Like that. Okay. Cause this, yep. All

368
00:50:43,530 --> 00:50:52,150
right. We're good. Everything's fine. Cause he gets the buff from the bird. All right. All right.

369
00:50:52,150 --> 00:50:58,460
Come on, Gwen. Let's go. He's got the garlic armor. Garlic armor means take two less damage.

370
00:50:59,099 --> 00:51:06,099
This is going to be a win. No, it's not. That was so much overconfidence, but nothing.

371
00:51:06,659 --> 00:51:19,670
I actually think I'm okay. Well, I didn't lose. Oh, that's right. He, he summons the chick. Okay.

372
00:51:22,380 --> 00:51:45,210
Wowee. Ho wowee. Let's do this. This sucks. If you buy a tier one pet, give current and future pets

373
00:51:45,210 --> 00:51:53,829
one, one. I don't. Bison is, seems pretty good if you have a level three. I like this game,

374
00:51:53,829 --> 00:52:01,369
but I'm not very good. All right. I need to figure this out. Um, I don't want any of these.

375
00:52:06,869 --> 00:52:14,440
The dog might be all right. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, he's not. No. Uh, let's just feed

376
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:33,940
some people cause he gets buff from food and, um, uh, worm is actually kind of good. I don't

377
00:52:33,940 --> 00:52:57,340
know if I want to keep the worm over the potential, uh, okay. All right. I just need

378
00:52:57,340 --> 00:53:05,909
to warm up round. That's fine. That's that, that shark is going to be a big problem though.

379
00:53:05,909 --> 00:53:11,829
This is a problem, but I, if the, I can last a pretty long time here with that garlic armor.

380
00:53:11,829 --> 00:53:18,420
That's fun to say when you've been fucking lost it, isn't it? That's all right. I can handle it.

381
00:53:20,710 --> 00:53:32,070
God damn it. What is this? All right. If you're watching my perspective, I didn't play the first

382
00:53:32,070 --> 00:53:35,190
two rounds. I didn't know there was a timer. I was talking to Chad about pancakes and waffles

383
00:53:35,190 --> 00:53:38,550
and shit. I didn't know there was a timer and I'm using the wrong pack anyway, so I'm disqualified.

384
00:53:38,550 --> 00:53:53,820
So I'm, I'm out. Is anybody else out? Oh, okay. Other people were out. It wasn't just me. I wasn't

385
00:53:53,820 --> 00:54:08,119
the first one out. All right. Let me get in there with the right pack, with the right mindset,

386
00:54:08,119 --> 00:54:14,380
with the right everything. You know what I mean? Let me get back in there. Oh my God. He gave 35

387
00:54:14,380 --> 00:54:29,849
subs Tommy B. Thanks a lot. I'm going to come back. Yeah. Lower bracket legend. Well, I, I'm

388
00:54:32,219 --> 00:54:50,840
finished the tier list. Yeah. I have to go here. All right. This game is really fun, but

389
00:54:51,639 --> 00:54:59,219
all right, we need to change the hat. Let's put the flower hat on. Okay. I'm ready now.

390
00:54:59,780 --> 00:55:10,010
He cheated and he lost. I feel like people are just like clapping for me because I'm the old guy.

391
00:55:10,650 --> 00:55:16,059
You know what I mean? Like, oh, German. Yeah. Come on. Come on over to the,

392
00:55:16,059 --> 00:55:22,380
to the tournament we're going to do. Oh yeah. There you are. Hi. Yep. Your seat's right there.

393
00:55:22,380 --> 00:55:29,340
Grandpa. Right at the end of the table. I clicked a click to use a different pack

394
00:55:29,340 --> 00:55:37,269
that everybody else is using. Yep. Grandpa. Hi. I don't even play the first three rounds.

395
00:55:38,389 --> 00:55:43,510
Oh, do you see grandpa just took just, just, I have to pay $2. I landed on park place for grandpa.

396
00:55:44,150 --> 00:55:45,980
What time is dinner?

397
00:56:03,159 --> 00:56:13,940
You're not. I know. I'm just kidding. I was kidding. Don't worry. Uh, so who's, who's actually

398
00:56:13,940 --> 00:56:19,510
winning? I just watched one of the other perspectives or should I just do some practice

399
00:56:20,389 --> 00:56:33,460
practice? Well, uh, good luck and congratulations to all the winners.

400
00:56:34,179 --> 00:56:40,119
Let's do some practice. All right. And if I had a second, you know what I mean? Like I would have

401
00:56:40,119 --> 00:56:47,269
already done this shit, like horses, bottom tier, absolute zero. And there you are. And there it is.

402
00:56:47,269 --> 00:56:55,929
And there it is. That's a great starter. We're going to be the shy. We're going to be the shy

403
00:56:55,929 --> 00:57:20,659
feet. The frigid legs. I like that one too. Yeah. I like this one. So now we got a team, right?

404
00:57:20,659 --> 00:57:38,969
Rigid legs. Okay. It's fine. Mosquito is good. All right. Now this is important. We're going to

405
00:57:38,969 --> 00:57:45,880
give this to, who do I want to give this to? We'll get a beaver and maybe a mosquito just to round

406
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:54,840
it out. And then we're going to give the, let's roll. Okay. This is good. This is really good.

407
00:57:54,840 --> 00:58:05,139
I do this now though, or should I wait as technically you get tier two and then you can

408
00:58:05,139 --> 00:58:12,170
go to tier three, right? Cause when you, when you get to three of the same, right? As if you,

409
00:58:12,170 --> 00:58:16,329
when you see me combine stuff, when it's a leveling up the creature, when you do that,

410
00:58:16,329 --> 00:58:23,269
it gives you the next tier. It pulls from the next tier of animals for you to play with. So

411
00:58:23,269 --> 00:58:31,110
shouldn't I wait for that to happen for us to go to tier two? So then I can just get a tier three

412
00:58:31,110 --> 00:58:38,489
kind of next turn. Yeah. From my understanding. So then I'm going to freeze you and give this just

413
00:58:38,489 --> 00:58:44,440
to the person in the back, which is by the way, a guaranteed win early on. If you honey the back

414
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:59,880
line here, this person here, it's pretty much a guaranteed win. Cause nobody does that. This

415
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:07,530
should be a pretty, this should be it. I think it's going to be all right. Everybody does that. I

416
00:59:07,530 --> 00:59:30,090
know they're all going to lose. Okay. So now I have tier two. This is where combine this. I want

417
00:59:30,090 --> 00:59:42,949
somebody else up here though. And I don't want it to be a cricket or start summoning. I don't have

418
00:59:42,949 --> 00:59:50,889
anything that is synergy synergizes. I don't have anything that synergizes with the dog is the worst

419
00:59:50,889 --> 00:59:58,840
stream of the year. Well, yeah. Right. I actually, I don't think so. I don't know. I feel like this

420
00:59:58,840 --> 01:00:07,340
is going to get good buying the fish. Yeah. But I want another person to get the one one. Hmm. Okay.

421
01:00:07,340 --> 01:00:23,300
Well, I know I'm doing this because it's just so good early. Maybe beaver. Hmm. Copy health from

422
01:00:23,300 --> 01:00:33,619
friend ahead. Uh, every time he attacks, he hurts the person behind him. So you need somebody that

423
01:00:33,619 --> 01:00:39,289
takes like a hurt does this. Hmm. It's really funny watching you fail. It's probably why you

424
01:00:39,289 --> 01:00:50,300
got invited. Hey, now I can't afford the fish. Oh, shit in my pants. You're right. I'll do it next

425
01:00:50,300 --> 01:01:20,920
turn. Hmm. Spider, I guess I should be upfront too. This is annoying. And then this will kill.

426
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:33,829
And then, yeah, that's fine. Remember you suck at this game. Yeah. Well, you know,

427
01:01:35,670 --> 01:01:54,090
that's fine. I think this is a win. Hey, I still, I still think I got this. Wow. Um, nevermind.

428
01:01:54,090 --> 01:02:03,849
No, no, I do. Yeah, I got it. Why does he only read from the room chats? Because I have, uh,

429
01:02:03,849 --> 01:02:10,619
I have this, uh, third party app that just shows only specific keyword, uh, users and stuff. So,

430
01:02:10,619 --> 01:02:23,750
um, loser, stupid, idiot, dumb, um, slow, uh, hurry up, too slow, speed, uh, brain. Brain's a big one

431
01:02:23,750 --> 01:02:42,409
that I look for. Yeah. I take my time. Sorry. I take my fucking time. Holy shit. Okay. So let's

432
01:02:42,409 --> 01:02:49,860
go with, I want the swan. The swan is very good. So I'm going to get rid of the mosquito

433
01:02:49,860 --> 01:03:01,369
before I do that. This is no, no, I'm going to do a big brain play. If I kill this, it'll give

434
01:03:01,369 --> 01:03:09,099
it's two, one to you. Put up the goose, do the level up. And then here we go. One, one. There's

435
01:03:09,099 --> 01:03:20,809
the giraffe. End turn. Give friend a head. One, one. Ooh. Uh, is that better? Should I get rid

436
01:03:20,809 --> 01:03:38,380
of the beaver now? I think so. Nice. Okay. Let's put the giraffe up. Fuck it. Why did it say that?

437
01:03:38,380 --> 01:03:56,730
That's the only time it's ever said the name of any animal. Oh, that's good. The dodo bird.

438
01:03:56,730 --> 01:04:09,380
I like the dodo bird. Um, okay. New germa frog. Cause you can call a germa a dumb ass. Yeah,

439
01:04:09,380 --> 01:04:15,639
that's fine. The giraffe to spider. So this, the spider is going to start to get a little bit,

440
01:04:15,639 --> 01:04:23,750
a little beefed up. Oh, maybe not. We'll see what happens next turn. I want this though,

441
01:04:23,750 --> 01:04:42,380
cause I want it for the spider. All right. Let's go. I got like frozen halfway through that one.

442
01:04:42,460 --> 01:04:53,219
It's too early. Too bad. It's the giraffe that's going to get the melon armor,

443
01:04:53,219 --> 01:05:05,510
which you get one hit for free. And he's going to just buff up this guy. Um, just barely,

444
01:05:05,510 --> 01:05:23,800
just barely. We get to have a draw. Badger when it dies, deal attack damage to adjacent pets.

445
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:48,019
That kind of sucks though, doesn't it? Shit. Ooh. The ox is good too. I'm keeping the ox.

446
01:05:48,019 --> 01:06:01,130
And should I replace, um, who should I replace with this? I'm freezing everything in a peacock.

447
01:06:01,130 --> 01:06:08,789
Don't want the peacock. All right. This should be good next round. Yeah. I'll get rid of the

448
01:06:08,789 --> 01:06:20,920
mosquito. I, the spider will start to carry this when the spider starts to carry, that's where it's

449
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:24,679
going to get good. Right? So I can get over, I'll get rid of three of his first three characters.

450
01:06:24,679 --> 01:06:36,500
I have enough to kill his Dodo. Oh God. I, it's going to be, yeah, I do. I went,

451
01:06:36,500 --> 01:06:50,519
that's why you always put the B in the back. Give something to the giraffe. Yeah. I think

452
01:06:51,079 --> 01:07:00,070
mosquito goes away. All right. Who am I going to give the garlic to? Swan. I think Swan gets

453
01:07:00,070 --> 01:07:13,269
the garlic. He's got the most health besides spider. I'm going to sell the mosquito. I'm going

454
01:07:13,269 --> 01:07:26,409
to buy the ox. So now the ox, when this thing dies, it summons something, which when that dies,

455
01:07:26,409 --> 01:07:30,409
he, so he's going to get this twice and melon armor and he's going to get hit with one ones.

456
01:07:30,409 --> 01:07:39,780
So he's going to be buffing the ox. The ox now needs the garlic armor. And then we round it out

457
01:07:39,780 --> 01:07:47,780
with, uh, leveling up the spider. I think, I think that's all right. Let's see what happens.

458
01:07:58,010 --> 01:08:04,179
So the tournament, I think it's, I think they're still doing it. They have players here that are

459
01:08:04,179 --> 01:08:10,199
real. Oh my God. That was 30 damage. So it just ended. All right. Well, we'll get into it.

460
01:08:10,199 --> 01:08:16,119
See what's happening here. Every time somebody dies in front of him, he gets to get two more

461
01:08:16,119 --> 01:08:26,659
health. I mean, two more damage that worked out, but I, I think this is a win. This is,

462
01:08:26,659 --> 01:08:47,079
Oh no, it's not. Damn it. They're waiting for you. Let me find out. Hey, you think, well,

463
01:08:48,039 --> 01:08:53,880
it's unfortunate you did make it through because you slightly cheated there by using the payday.

464
01:08:56,489 --> 01:09:01,930
Listen, I was told I could use whatever pack I wanted to. I did the same thing. You were told

465
01:09:01,930 --> 01:09:16,569
that yes. Uh, this was the common conception among the pro circuit. I'm glad I wasn't the only one

466
01:09:16,569 --> 01:09:22,739
I got. I'm sweating. I was, I was here and prepared like yesterday too. And it's like,

467
01:09:22,739 --> 01:09:29,430
Oh yeah, I don't even know what I did. What did I do? You used the pay to win pack and I said it

468
01:09:29,430 --> 01:09:34,630
was free to, uh, free to win only for this one. And then I said, uh, the main lobby, my bad. I

469
01:09:34,630 --> 01:09:40,069
didn't even know I was using a browser version. Yeah. You know, I think we'll, we'll, we'll let

470
01:09:40,069 --> 01:09:44,390
it slide. I honestly don't think it's like, um, a big difference maker. I mean, if you don't expect

471
01:09:44,390 --> 01:09:48,789
that it can be a little weird, but I don't think pay to win is better than free to win even.

472
01:09:51,100 --> 01:10:00,550
Uh, I have no idea which bracket I'm in. Was I the only one who didn't buy pets on the first round?

473
01:10:00,550 --> 01:10:09,989
No, I didn't. I'm sitting there. I'm sitting there. I'm not knowing like what I'm looking at,

474
01:10:09,989 --> 01:10:15,270
right? I'm thinking I'm looking at the fucking starting screen, which I was I go into battle.

475
01:10:15,270 --> 01:10:19,350
My chat's like, you didn't buy any pets. I'm like, what do you mean? I literally get rolled.

476
01:10:19,350 --> 01:10:22,630
And then the second round, I finally have pets. And then the people have more pets than me.

477
01:10:23,029 --> 01:10:30,260
It's got to absolutely demolish. I just, I just didn't know that I didn't know there was a timer.

478
01:10:30,260 --> 01:10:35,300
I said it to the normal pets. Now I was quite confused. You can play whatever you want. Now

479
01:10:35,300 --> 01:10:38,489
I was against the lady bug. And then the second round, there was a person with one pet.

480
01:10:40,739 --> 01:10:45,060
You can play any deck in the second will might be in a one V one against me though,

481
01:10:45,060 --> 01:10:50,579
for the eighth spot. So, oh, well, no, no, I believe you guys are both, uh, in top eight.

482
01:10:50,579 --> 01:10:56,100
You guys didn't draw, but you drew. So I think it's logic stands five up Abe,

483
01:10:56,100 --> 01:11:03,899
Yeti, Ray, Dan, and Will. Uh, and then the other bracket is, uh, Wendy,

484
01:11:03,899 --> 01:11:12,979
Jerma, Saikuno, Mango, Buddha, Anthony, Otto, Alex. Very cool. Uh, I believe is the seating for each

485
01:11:12,979 --> 01:11:18,810
or not the seating with the people on each. Um, and then give me just like a couple of minutes.

486
01:11:18,810 --> 01:11:21,689
I'll get the seating up and then we'll start the tournament and everyone can just play one

487
01:11:21,689 --> 01:11:29,079
V one at once. Sounds good. Let's do it. All right. Did you say any pack this time? Does it matter

488
01:11:29,079 --> 01:11:33,319
on this any pack? Yeah. Any pack's fine. Any pack. I would just recommend buying.

489
01:11:33,319 --> 01:11:43,539
I'm going to play Anthony in the first round, please. Just don't buy pets again, please.

490
01:11:43,539 --> 01:11:48,439
No problem. You know what, man? I got, I got a nasty little strat.

491
01:11:48,439 --> 01:11:54,899
It's a lot. You can go ahead and see that one. We've agreed to it is really fun. It is a great

492
01:11:54,899 --> 01:12:09,300
game. I've been so addicted to him. Oh, he played it so bad. I feel all right. I'm muted over there.

493
01:12:09,300 --> 01:12:11,859
All right. So let me, let me see if I can play this out because I feel like this is going to get

494
01:12:11,859 --> 01:12:18,779
all right. So the shark is one versus one. I'm around for the other brackets or is it just like

495
01:12:18,779 --> 01:12:22,699
the rest of it is all white. I believe so. Yeah. I think I get rid of the night. No one from the

496
01:12:22,699 --> 01:12:27,340
winter black bracket plays somewhere to the draft bracket. No, no, it's two groups of eight.

497
01:12:27,819 --> 01:12:34,439
That would be so important. Number eight winner that and then it goes up to the end.

498
01:12:34,439 --> 01:12:39,880
Oh, simultaneous matches, right? Yeah. I feel like I need to replace somebody, probably the fish.

499
01:12:39,880 --> 01:12:47,130
So it's like first and eight seeds or some shit. I would assume so. I don't know how they roll me.

500
01:12:47,130 --> 01:12:51,960
Is that what's going on? It's way better if they randomize it though. Yeah, they should randomize

501
01:12:51,960 --> 01:13:00,520
it. Well, I just have a stream. He had the bracket two, seven, one, eight. Oh, no. I mean,

502
01:13:00,520 --> 01:13:07,819
will and logic means I don't know. Me versus Aiden. Do I have time to use the bathroom?

503
01:13:10,970 --> 01:13:21,579
All right. I think we've got like a minute or two here. What? He killed it. What? What happened?

504
01:13:21,579 --> 01:13:29,380
How did he kill that? Oh, that's that's actually pretty good. I'm happy about this.

505
01:13:29,380 --> 01:13:40,569
Did we all take a few hits? Come on. Well, that sucks. The whole reason I bought the

506
01:13:40,569 --> 01:13:52,220
shark and he died instantly. They should better at this game than Mario Kart.

507
01:13:52,300 --> 01:14:02,760
Now, that's the first round. I really I swear to God it was I just wasn't prepared. I was.

508
01:14:02,760 --> 01:14:06,199
But you know what I mean? Like it just I was all fucked up. I missed the first two rounds.

509
01:14:06,199 --> 01:14:09,960
And then it was like at that point I was just buying. I just bought the first three random

510
01:14:09,960 --> 01:14:19,430
things I could find. This one will be better. I promise. Skunk is good. Oh, OK. Wait,

511
01:14:19,430 --> 01:14:27,720
I need stuff that dies and comes back. Spiders like let's get the I need stuff that like dies

512
01:14:27,720 --> 01:14:34,220
and comes back like another spider, I guess. Another giraffe. This is good.

513
01:14:46,060 --> 01:14:56,520
All right. All right. All right. Check back and make sure what should just played better.

514
01:14:58,979 --> 01:15:03,800
Predict the bet. Yeah, that's my fault. I should I chose the wrong pack. I think we're good.

515
01:15:03,800 --> 01:15:09,579
I'm still got time. All right. We want that spider. I want this pair. And now this if I get this to

516
01:15:09,579 --> 01:15:14,390
a two, that means he'll give something in front of him to two, which is huge. All right, let's go.

517
01:15:14,390 --> 01:15:21,770
This time, don't die. Can you say hello? Hello to my friend, Ben Dover.

518
01:15:21,770 --> 01:15:34,920
Come on, Ben. Hope the Dover family is doing well. Oh, there we go. All right.

519
01:15:34,920 --> 01:15:44,279
Feed the hell out of that shark. Stop that. This might be a victory.

520
01:15:44,279 --> 01:15:51,829
No, maybe not. Do I have enough to get through both of them? I think I do.

521
01:15:54,600 --> 01:16:03,430
No, it's going to be. Yeah, I do. No, you probably have some friendly banter.

522
01:16:03,430 --> 01:16:07,189
I don't see a problem. You could have friendly banter. There's no problem with that. It's more

523
01:16:07,189 --> 01:16:14,460
so for me to spectate and chat when you when you join. Yeah, we'll just meet up. Yeah. Yeah.

524
01:16:14,460 --> 01:16:17,000
We'll just hop in. I guess if we're not in there, it's totally fine,

525
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:21,399
because most people we won't be in there for. That's not perfect entertainment for our own

526
01:16:21,399 --> 01:16:27,930
stream. Yeah. How do we know who we're going to get? It's in the bracket. OK. OK. OK.

527
01:16:33,420 --> 01:16:40,140
Do we make the games now? Yeah, we'll just you're going to hop in the call. Yeah, make the game

528
01:16:40,140 --> 01:16:45,640
against each other to make the game, by the way, if you guys don't know, all you need to do is to

529
01:16:46,199 --> 01:16:52,460
create private game, hit Max players to make the name and then just put it in general chat and at

530
01:16:52,460 --> 01:16:58,869
the person. All right. So who are we out here? Well, I should be good makers. All right, logic.

531
01:16:58,869 --> 01:17:04,949
I'll jump in your little thingamabob in discord. Sounds good. By the way, this is a best of one.

532
01:17:04,949 --> 01:17:11,430
You can use any pack. OK. And we get eliminated. You're out. Should we be in the same

533
01:17:11,510 --> 01:17:19,210
call as our opponent? Yes. OK. And then are we streaming our perspective on discord? Yeah. I

534
01:17:19,210 --> 01:17:23,609
mean, only one you really know. I guess it'd be a bit cool. Both of you did. Yeah. It is stream your

535
01:17:23,609 --> 01:17:29,210
POV. OK. Yeah. Something about the way that my stuff hooks in through OBS, it like it always shuts

536
01:17:29,210 --> 01:17:34,899
off. Yeah, I know you're shit. Fucked. That's good. You're good. Sorry about that. And also,

537
01:17:34,899 --> 01:17:41,340
if you don't start round two is the only other thing. Oh, OK. So wait until everyone's done.

538
01:17:41,340 --> 01:17:47,590
Yeah. All right. We we good. Can we just kind of just stand and go off? Go off. Go off. All right.

539
01:17:47,590 --> 01:17:55,979
Just enter your group or just enter wherever. Good luck, everybody. Where am I going? What's

540
01:17:55,979 --> 01:18:08,180
up with all the licks in your chat? I don't I don't know. I mean, they like licking. How did you have

541
01:18:08,180 --> 01:18:14,600
my chat open? I am streaming your stream and then putting my face over your face so people don't

542
01:18:14,600 --> 01:18:22,789
notice that there's an audio to video delay. Appreciate you telling me. All right. Where am

543
01:18:22,789 --> 01:18:31,619
I going? Round one, group four. Jerma, you are up against Wendy. Wendy. Yeah. So just any call

544
01:18:31,619 --> 01:18:38,489
of Wendy. You can enter. Yeah. You know, people didn't really, you know, heed to the to the group

545
01:18:38,489 --> 01:18:43,720
location. I see. I see. They're going to pick a random one of these rooms. You could just pick

546
01:18:43,720 --> 01:18:54,380
any room. OK. How about round one, group one? That sounds good. Oh, there was another round

547
01:18:54,380 --> 01:18:59,189
one group one. Oh, is there two of them? Yeah, there's a constellation, which is the one where

548
01:19:00,300 --> 01:19:04,699
well, I did not do very well last round. Good. I'll be very honest. I made the pass already. It's

549
01:19:04,699 --> 01:19:11,850
a woohoo yay. If you check the general channel, I added you. Oh, is that the name of the game?

550
01:19:11,850 --> 01:19:23,319
Because I think that I may have just screamed you saying that when we get in. It's so easy.

551
01:19:23,319 --> 01:19:42,569
OK, so versus mode, join private. That is the new pass for us. Very cool. All right. I don't

552
01:19:42,569 --> 01:19:50,390
want to leak it. Don't think I should be in. All right. So this is don't do don't do around

553
01:19:50,390 --> 01:19:58,579
two. We're just doing this once. Yeah. All right. Well, good luck. So how much how much experience

554
01:19:58,579 --> 01:20:06,739
you have with the game? I play like a decent amount, but I'm not that good at it. OK. Yeah,

555
01:20:06,739 --> 01:20:16,619
because I've been playing for about an hour or two, maybe. I'm going to try though. Yeah.

556
01:20:19,619 --> 01:20:25,270
There's a timer, right? Timer. Illegal sausages. That's me. I need a name, too.

557
01:20:29,659 --> 01:20:34,760
Did that in the wrong order. But, you know, get everything correct every time.

558
01:20:43,289 --> 01:20:48,020
I need a team name, too. It took so long.

559
01:20:51,369 --> 01:20:59,319
The talkative piggies. How does that sound? Well, I've got some piggies on my team. OK,

560
01:20:59,319 --> 01:21:10,300
you don't got any on yours. No, I think I'm going otter strat. Otter strat.

561
01:21:12,119 --> 01:21:16,710
Fifteen health. Oh, wow. This is going to be interesting. This will get interesting.

562
01:21:16,710 --> 01:21:30,149
So I can't we can't really talk strategy because you're right here. That's right. We can't.

563
01:21:34,470 --> 01:21:43,140
Well, I got the mute button. All right. What do I do? Why this game? This game has a way of

564
01:21:43,140 --> 01:21:50,890
doing weird things. Yeah, it's the servers get kind of hammered, don't they?

565
01:21:51,609 --> 01:22:03,239
All right. I think I ran out of time. I'm muted. Don't worry. God damn it.

566
01:22:16,789 --> 01:22:29,609
Nice. Very nice. I'm definitely going to go. I guess I'm going to switch it up a little. Let's

567
01:22:29,609 --> 01:22:48,630
see. Does the buff work? I don't know. I'm very I'm very curious. We'll find out.

568
01:22:48,630 --> 01:23:18,600
Timer gets me like every time. Yeah, I actually didn't know there was a timer in the first in

569
01:23:18,600 --> 01:23:22,760
the seating. So I like totally messed up one of my rounds and I was like, no.

570
01:23:24,180 --> 01:23:29,460
Yeah, I didn't play pets on the first two rounds, I don't think, because I was just talking. Oh,

571
01:23:29,460 --> 01:23:47,670
my God. I know I was so distracted. I'm just so distractible. Oh, yeah. I got to try to try

572
01:23:47,670 --> 01:24:16,920
to beef that dodo up. Oh, it's gonna be close. Guys, I think it's time for ant. Do you think so?

573
01:24:17,800 --> 01:24:26,020
Get rid of cricket. Go for ant. No, wait, get rid of cricket. Go for ant. That's I just said

574
01:24:26,020 --> 01:24:49,430
the exact same thing. Nothing that I said changed. OK, is that it? The dodo needs. Oh,

575
01:24:49,430 --> 01:25:05,210
shit. Thirty seconds. The dodo needs the buff. Hmm. OK. Oh, I realize we should be streaming

576
01:25:05,210 --> 01:25:11,880
our stuff. Yeah. For some reason, when I try to hook through to do both, it doesn't capture

577
01:25:11,880 --> 01:25:15,319
one of them. And usually the one it doesn't capture is the stream I'm streaming to.

578
01:25:16,680 --> 01:25:46,390
I don't know why. I think I got a big play next turn. I'll see. Crab. What does the crab do?

579
01:25:46,390 --> 01:26:35,289
Poppies. Dodo is so good. Oh, no. I do that wrong. I may have just done that completely wrong. Oh,

580
01:26:35,289 --> 01:28:06,090
well, that's a beefed up pig. Oh, OK. All right. All right. All right. OK. I got a minute. I'm

581
01:28:06,090 --> 01:28:13,510
sitting there freaking out. I thought I had like 10 seconds left. I'm also trying to think about

582
01:28:13,510 --> 01:29:19,220
my life choices over here, man. Yeah. Hmm. OK. OK. I don't think it's going to be enough

583
01:29:19,220 --> 01:29:56,779
until maybe next round. Oh, that crab, that crab getting beefy. I'm not throwing. I'm not throwing.

584
01:29:56,779 --> 01:30:01,449
I have to mute. I don't want to sound like a weirdo, like like I'm screaming at people.

585
01:30:01,449 --> 01:30:08,729
I'm not throwing. He sucks. You know, I'm not going to say you. I'm going to say no.

586
01:30:09,289 --> 01:30:14,810
Leave me alone. OK. The play is give the meat to the deer because the deer is going to do five,

587
01:30:14,810 --> 01:30:20,180
six damage and it's going to do five damage to splash damage. And then the play after that is

588
01:30:20,180 --> 01:30:32,390
going to be mosquito. No, sell. I'm going to sell the mosquito and put the kangaroo in and then put

589
01:30:32,390 --> 01:30:44,489
the kangaroo behind here. I don't know. Who am I selling here? Oh, my God. I have 20 seconds. Oh,

590
01:30:44,489 --> 01:31:13,060
my God. OK. Play. I usually like take forever to think. So this timer is freaking me out. Yeah.

591
01:31:14,649 --> 01:31:17,449
The only experience I have with the game is with no time or just sitting there,

592
01:31:17,449 --> 01:31:32,619
just going, hmm, no, I wonder what that would do. Yeah. Well, I think I'm in trouble here.

593
01:31:32,619 --> 01:31:47,239
I think that's what one or two more or no, two, three more. And then that's it. If you win.

594
01:31:48,619 --> 01:32:03,529
How much else do you have? I have five. I think like two more. And it looks good.

595
01:32:03,529 --> 01:32:30,170
He was saying, why do I still have the otter? It's cute. He's got a cute hat on.

596
01:32:30,170 --> 01:32:50,810
Oh, you have hats. Oh, I have little bear hats. That's a lot of damage.

597
01:32:50,810 --> 01:33:14,659
Oh, the monkey monkey's amazing. All right. Well, see what happens. This is my last attempt here.

598
01:33:16,140 --> 01:33:29,720
See if I can pull through. Hmm. Your dual core CPU brain is overheating.

599
01:33:31,670 --> 01:33:49,750
I have at least a Pentium three. OK. Oh, shit. That's they just gave me like every

600
01:33:49,750 --> 01:34:44,279
big top tiered pet in the whole game right now. OK, pivot angle. Hmm. Oh, oh, you got the turkey

601
01:34:44,279 --> 01:34:48,279
and the cow. Yeah, I think it might be it might be too little too late, though.

602
01:34:48,279 --> 01:35:16,659
That is a GG. I wish you luck in the remainder of the tournament. Thanks. It's going to take for

603
01:35:17,539 --> 01:35:23,350
to go through the winners finish and then the losers bracket. And then I have a feeling it's

604
01:35:23,350 --> 01:35:28,630
going to go back and forth a lot in those higher. I'm like curious as how it's going to play out.

605
01:35:28,630 --> 01:35:39,560
I need some more practice. Yeah, me too. Isn't that why we're here?

606
01:35:40,199 --> 01:35:43,880
Yeah, well, Ludwig was like, hey, you want to play in the tournament?

607
01:35:43,880 --> 01:35:49,029
I'm doing super autopets tournament and I'm like, sure, I'll give it a whirl.

608
01:35:49,750 --> 01:35:55,350
It's really fun. It's actually like a really fun game. It is really fun. It's also really

609
01:35:55,350 --> 01:36:12,659
infuriating. Mm hmm. Tournament loser speed run. Did I lose? Did I lose the fastest?

610
01:36:12,659 --> 01:36:27,960
I have no idea. I think we have to report the winner or loser, right?

611
01:36:28,779 --> 01:36:35,460
Uh, yeah, we just put it in general. I would assume so.

612
01:36:36,020 --> 01:36:54,020
Okay. Have you played the DLC pack? I have, yeah. Do you like it more or?

613
01:36:54,020 --> 01:37:03,180
I really can't even tell because I like the bugs. The bugs are cool. But besides the bugs,

614
01:37:04,060 --> 01:37:10,069
it kind of gets messy. Let me wait. Let me take a look. Yeah, the Beatles are cool.

615
01:37:11,220 --> 01:37:18,229
The what else we got? Is it bad in the main game? Because that's incredible.

616
01:37:18,229 --> 01:37:26,390
Sorry, what did you say? Is the bad in the base game? Oh, sure. Because that's probably one of

617
01:37:26,390 --> 01:37:34,760
the best abilities in the game to give somebody weak. I don't think it's in the base game.

618
01:37:34,760 --> 01:37:40,039
Yeah, the bat replaces whatever you have for a buff with weakness. Oh, okay. Yeah,

619
01:37:40,039 --> 01:37:50,199
it's not in the base game. Yeah, that character is insane. What else is in here? It's happy cats

620
01:37:50,199 --> 01:37:58,630
new too. I mean, everything is kind of new to still people in the base game. I have no idea

621
01:37:58,630 --> 01:38:06,500
how to play with a lobster poodle. Yeah, I haven't played with any of them.

622
01:38:12,600 --> 01:38:20,229
Talk about you being the sus guy. What are you talking about? What are you doing? I'm hey,

623
01:38:20,229 --> 01:38:25,689
I'll buy the link. It's just case you do not. I'm the sus guy. I think that would be like a okay,

624
01:38:25,689 --> 01:38:33,939
like who cares? What are you talking about? Well, I lost the tournament, but I'm the sus guy. I get

625
01:38:33,939 --> 01:38:49,930
to keep that. That's what I get to keep with me. That's like a double loss. Do you get points?

626
01:38:49,930 --> 01:38:57,579
It's 5000 points to buy a new background. Yeah, I think so. Let me see. Or you can just purchase

627
01:38:57,579 --> 01:39:03,210
it around. Oh, yeah, I guess so. Oh, actually, no, there's some with like 500 points and like

628
01:39:03,210 --> 01:39:07,720
1000 points or something. I don't really care about the background. So I feel like the hats

629
01:39:07,720 --> 01:39:16,470
are way better. Oh, yeah. I would definitely spend that money here. There's a lot of hats too.

630
01:39:16,470 --> 01:39:23,930
A lot of cute hats. Yeah. I love how the 5000 point one is a golden poop as if that's the thing

631
01:39:24,010 --> 01:39:30,949
that like shows that you're a true winner. How long does it take to get to 5000 points?

632
01:39:30,949 --> 01:39:43,079
I don't know. I feel like it comes pretty quickly. Hey, what's up? Oh, wait, he's just,

633
01:39:43,079 --> 01:39:54,840
I guess was spying on us and then left. Yep. I think people made new channels. Yeah,

634
01:39:54,840 --> 01:39:59,399
I think people to move into the general, I think temporarily or new stuff. Let's see.

635
01:39:59,399 --> 01:40:14,279
I need a sus hat. I don't need a sus hat. Why would I have a sus hat? I thought I was muted

636
01:40:14,279 --> 01:40:23,109
when I just said that. Thanks a lot. That just, that makes it sound like that's all I talk about.

637
01:40:23,109 --> 01:40:50,869
Oh no, Chad, there's no sus hat for me. Golden poop. Yeah. Early adopter hat too. This one looks

638
01:40:50,869 --> 01:41:03,930
kind of cool. Only five bucks, right? For the expansion. The game's free. Yes. It's very,

639
01:41:03,930 --> 01:41:08,789
very, very affordable for the kind of the word you get to play. Yeah. And you can also play it

640
01:41:08,789 --> 01:41:15,380
on your phone if you have Android. Are you serious? Yeah. Oh, playing it on my phone. Oh my god.

641
01:41:15,939 --> 01:41:24,020
I want, I have, I have iPhone, which sucks. Oh, you have an iPhone. Yeah. I want to play it.

642
01:41:26,979 --> 01:41:36,390
I was going to switch to Android, but I just know Apple too. It's all I've used,

643
01:41:36,390 --> 01:41:42,140
even though I don't like it. Yeah. I've also only used like Android, mostly except for like,

644
01:41:42,140 --> 01:41:49,989
I don't know, like iPods and stuff. Yeah, iPad. It's funny because I was so against the Mac

645
01:41:49,989 --> 01:41:56,630
computers. I was like, I'm never going to buy one of those overpriced pieces of shit. And then I

646
01:41:56,630 --> 01:42:07,909
just bought all their other products. Okay. It says we can move to general. Okay. Okay. I want

647
01:42:07,909 --> 01:42:30,939
to move over to general. Yeah. Good to do. GG's. GG. Good luck. I play among us on iOS. You guys

648
01:42:30,939 --> 01:42:54,699
have fucking, okay. Yeah. Good luck. She, she was good. You're awkward. We're just have fucking

649
01:42:55,340 --> 01:43:06,020
what are you talking about? You guys need to relax. Sounds good to me. All right. Uh, let's

650
01:43:06,020 --> 01:43:12,439
get it started. You can just join semi-groups one. That's Psycho. No, I'm trying to think. No,

651
01:43:12,439 --> 01:43:19,529
no. Excuse me. That's auto mango. No, it's Dan Ray. I'm looking reefer Dan Ray, your auto,

652
01:43:19,529 --> 01:43:25,319
your group one, and then auto mango, your group two and auto, you just set it up and put the code

653
01:43:25,319 --> 01:43:30,279
in general. Mango will join. Let me, let me just make sure I'm very clear. If I lost that last game,

654
01:43:30,279 --> 01:43:35,060
that means I'm out of the tournament. It is single limb. Yeah. You're out from here. Okay.

655
01:43:35,060 --> 01:43:39,859
Well, thanks for playing Jerma. I actually had a great time. It was like, actually it was like

656
01:43:39,859 --> 01:43:47,699
really fun. It feels like a bit of a Jerma game. It's a great game. I love it. Some people have

657
01:43:47,699 --> 01:43:54,859
called it the next battleship. I mean, I don't know if I'd go that far, but it's so addicting

658
01:43:54,859 --> 01:43:59,340
to it's good battleship was pretty fun. It was really fun. Good gun here. Northern line. I mean,

659
01:43:59,340 --> 01:44:05,159
it's not that big. All right, let's get it started. If you guys are, want to spectate,

660
01:44:05,159 --> 01:44:11,079
or if you're like waiting, you can hop in just like mute. Okay. And so where, where do I go?

661
01:44:11,079 --> 01:44:15,560
I go to Sammy's group one or number two. We're going to hold your match because we're just doing

662
01:44:15,560 --> 01:44:19,079
two right now. I'll play for a little bit longer. I'm not going to end the screen. And then auto

663
01:44:19,079 --> 01:44:24,920
mango. Oh, so I watch Ray's game. You just watch Ray's game. Yeah. Okay. Thanks for having me by

664
01:44:24,920 --> 01:44:29,319
the way. Thanks Alex so much for playing brother. Yeah. I'll, I'll see you guys later. Bye guys.

665
01:44:29,319 --> 01:44:37,130
Good luck to everybody else. All right, hop in, get it started. You two for you four. Uh,

666
01:44:37,130 --> 01:44:42,550
and we're going to occasionally hop. Hmm. Yeah. Have a great time. Everybody. I wish everybody

667
01:44:42,550 --> 01:44:46,390
really good luck on all the rest of the games for the rest of the day. And I will see you later.

668
01:44:46,390 --> 01:45:08,020
It was a lot of fun. I was muted. Don't worry. I'm not a fucking weirdo. Yeah. The stream was

669
01:45:08,020 --> 01:45:17,210
going to be small. That was fun. I look, I'm just, it was fun. What time is it? Yeah. This is going

670
01:45:17,529 --> 01:45:23,979
to be a short stream. I'll play a couple of rounds. I am the sus guy by the way. No, I did. I did.

671
01:45:23,979 --> 01:45:28,859
Okay. My biggest mistake with making like, um, just kind of like talk to small talk with it,

672
01:45:28,859 --> 01:45:34,789
but just anybody is if I do like the funny voice, that's when it's like, okay, I gotta,

673
01:45:34,789 --> 01:45:37,989
I gotta slow down. This is not like, this is not small talk anymore. I'm like, I'm,

674
01:45:37,989 --> 01:45:44,869
I'm being like a funny guy. You know what I mean? Like, oh, the Mac, ah, piece of shit Macintosh.

675
01:45:44,869 --> 01:46:00,420
Like I, that's slow down. That bit was so bad. I'm not even, it wasn't even making a bit. It was

676
01:46:00,420 --> 01:46:20,470
just, you were so normal. I've told you guys this million times before. Okay. Like I, I,

677
01:46:20,470 --> 01:46:26,949
we can be a weirdo in our own house, right? But we'll go to somebody else's house. If you get

678
01:46:26,949 --> 01:46:33,819
invited to somebody else's house, you don't just grab a microphone in their home and just walk

679
01:46:33,819 --> 01:46:39,699
around and just yell stuff. They're not prepared for that. They're not, they don't want to hear

680
01:46:39,699 --> 01:46:46,470
that. You know what I mean? That's the quickest way to get disinvited to anything else in the

681
01:46:46,470 --> 01:46:52,920
future is being in that general chat with like 15 people and being like, hey, once I picked

682
01:46:52,920 --> 01:46:58,359
the beaver and, oh, that's kind of the, the beaver goes and makes that sound and then he goes na na na

683
01:46:58,359 --> 01:47:02,840
na na na naas on the corn. And then I put the horse in there and they'd be like, all right,

684
01:47:02,840 --> 01:47:06,520
Jeremy, we get fucking can you stop? Like, can you leave the call? Like, stop, we're trying to like

685
01:47:06,520 --> 01:47:19,220
set this up. You can't be a weirdo in somebody. You could be a weirdo in your own home. Right.

686
01:47:19,220 --> 01:47:34,819
You held that all in. I heard duck is bad, but that was fun though, that was really cool. You

687
01:47:34,819 --> 01:47:38,569
You held, you were holding that in the whole time.

688
01:47:38,569 --> 01:47:40,989
Host your own tournament where you're in charge.

689
01:47:40,989 --> 01:47:42,250
Yeah, but that's the thing.

690
01:47:42,250 --> 01:47:46,420
I could host a tournament and be in charge, but guess what?

691
01:47:46,420 --> 01:47:47,939
When I send those invites out,

692
01:47:47,939 --> 01:47:50,460
people are gonna know that I'm the one in charge,

693
01:47:50,460 --> 01:47:51,300
and they're gonna be like,

694
01:47:51,300 --> 01:47:58,130
I don't know if I wanna hear this dude nay like 20 times.

695
01:47:58,130 --> 01:48:00,210
I might get, okay, I might get two people

696
01:48:00,210 --> 01:48:01,409
to come to that party,

697
01:48:01,409 --> 01:48:03,930
but it's people I don't necessarily want to be there.

698
01:48:03,930 --> 01:48:06,130
You know what I'm saying?

699
01:48:06,130 --> 01:48:08,449
Like, if you know like the weird guys having the party,

700
01:48:08,449 --> 01:48:11,770
you might attract like the weird other guy,

701
01:48:11,770 --> 01:48:15,140
and then you have to out weird that person.

702
01:48:15,140 --> 01:48:27,060
It then becomes a competition between who's weirder.

703
01:48:27,060 --> 01:48:30,739
No, all jokes aside, I wish them everybody else luck.

704
01:48:30,739 --> 01:48:34,829
It was fun, I'm glad to have been invited.

705
01:48:34,829 --> 01:48:36,699
It was very entertaining.

706
01:48:36,699 --> 01:48:40,300
So now what's gonna happen is I'm gonna go pee,

707
01:48:40,300 --> 01:48:41,460
and I'll be right back.

708
01:48:41,460 --> 01:48:42,859
I'll play a couple more rounds,

709
01:48:42,859 --> 01:48:44,020
and then I'm probably gonna stop

710
01:48:44,020 --> 01:48:50,880
after like another 30 minutes, so I'll be right back.

711
01:48:50,880 --> 01:54:31,399
We'll just chill.

712
01:54:31,399 --> 01:54:32,239
All right, I'm back.

713
01:54:32,239 --> 01:54:36,329
Sorry about that.

714
01:54:36,329 --> 01:54:43,949
That was one of those really, really weird pees.

715
01:54:46,090 --> 01:54:51,390
I was peeing, and it like felt like I still had to go.

716
01:54:51,390 --> 01:54:55,069
Like I hadn't even gone yet, mid-pee.

717
01:54:55,069 --> 01:55:00,670
You know what I'm saying?

718
01:55:00,670 --> 01:55:02,770
Like after like a full 20 seconds,

719
01:55:02,770 --> 01:55:07,460
it was like I still hadn't gone pee yet.

720
01:55:07,460 --> 01:55:09,079
It was like, what's going on?

721
01:55:09,079 --> 01:55:11,369
It was like at the brim for some reason.

722
01:55:11,369 --> 01:55:14,079
No, I don't have a UTI.

723
01:55:14,079 --> 01:55:18,899
And then it felt like it was going.

724
01:55:18,899 --> 01:55:22,520
Okay, all right, let's do this a little bit.

725
01:55:22,520 --> 01:55:24,310
We can take our time.

726
01:55:24,310 --> 01:55:26,300
This game is actually pretty fun.

727
01:55:26,300 --> 01:55:27,699
I don't think I'm gonna stream this again,

728
01:55:27,699 --> 01:55:30,689
but I mean, I did say this is a short stream,

729
01:55:30,689 --> 01:55:32,689
but I think two hours is too short,

730
01:55:32,689 --> 01:55:37,300
and four hours is too long to be a short stream.

731
01:55:37,300 --> 01:55:42,489
So let's see if we can round it out in the next 30 minutes.

732
01:55:42,489 --> 01:55:45,260
Okay, the horse is, I don't like the horse very much.

733
01:55:45,260 --> 01:55:47,000
I'm not joking, that's a UTI.

734
01:55:51,409 --> 01:55:52,569
I'll be all right.

735
01:55:52,569 --> 01:55:57,109
I don't have a UTI, okay?

736
01:55:57,109 --> 01:56:02,149
A beaver is just good, early.

737
01:56:02,149 --> 01:56:04,010
I keep hearing about this duck meta,

738
01:56:04,010 --> 01:56:07,569
and I don't really wanna listen to it,

739
01:56:07,569 --> 01:56:10,729
but I feel like give shop pets one-one.

740
01:56:10,729 --> 01:56:15,930
Is that permanent?

741
01:56:15,930 --> 01:56:18,939
Or is it only the pets that are down here in the shop?

742
01:56:18,939 --> 01:56:24,420
Or is it a permanent thing to everybody?

743
01:56:24,420 --> 01:56:26,890
Just those, huh.

744
01:56:26,890 --> 01:56:29,899
I feel like that's not that good.

745
01:56:29,899 --> 01:56:34,460
Maybe like really early, you just sell them immediately.

746
01:56:34,460 --> 01:56:37,619
Like next round, just sell it.

747
01:56:37,619 --> 01:56:43,020
I'll try it.

748
01:56:43,020 --> 01:56:47,590
I don't want the horse though.

749
01:56:47,590 --> 01:56:50,989
Here we go, okay.

750
01:56:50,989 --> 01:56:58,500
I could do two beavers, and just buff somebody up.

751
01:56:58,500 --> 01:57:01,779
Or fish is just a good, it's a two-three.

752
01:57:01,779 --> 01:57:08,130
I'll go with fish.

753
01:57:08,130 --> 01:57:12,930
All right, the confused teabags, the full scouts,

754
01:57:12,930 --> 01:57:17,340
precious teabags, the precious bikers.

755
01:57:17,340 --> 01:57:26,899
What about the precious teabags?

756
01:57:26,899 --> 01:57:30,020
About buying bees?

757
01:57:30,060 --> 01:57:31,899
I feel like early, the bees are really good.

758
01:57:31,899 --> 01:57:33,319
And I wouldn't listen to anything I say,

759
01:57:33,319 --> 01:57:37,890
because obviously I came in last place in the tournament.

760
01:57:37,890 --> 01:57:48,270
But they just, they seem really useful.

761
01:57:48,270 --> 01:57:51,760
Bee is ass most of the time.

762
01:57:51,760 --> 01:57:59,199
Well, this is good, okay.

763
01:57:59,199 --> 01:58:00,680
I feel like I know people are gonna,

764
01:58:00,680 --> 01:58:02,060
people are telling me don't do bee,

765
01:58:02,060 --> 01:58:03,760
but I'm gonna do the bee.

766
01:58:03,760 --> 01:58:11,289
It's my strategy.

767
01:58:11,289 --> 01:58:12,850
All right, do I just want a second two-three,

768
01:58:12,850 --> 01:58:14,090
or should I get a cricket?

769
01:58:14,090 --> 01:58:17,359
So that would be a one-one, maybe a second fish,

770
01:58:17,359 --> 01:58:23,569
and I can combine them later.

771
01:58:23,569 --> 01:58:28,039
That looks good.

772
01:58:28,039 --> 01:58:31,140
Didn't I just buy?

773
01:58:31,140 --> 01:58:32,939
You have a random friend, one-one.

774
01:58:32,939 --> 01:58:41,619
That didn't happen.

775
01:58:41,619 --> 01:58:46,859
Did it happen?

776
01:58:46,859 --> 01:58:48,619
Happens when you buy the otter.

777
01:58:48,619 --> 01:58:49,619
Only the otter?

778
01:58:49,619 --> 01:58:53,210
Oh, I thought it was when you buy, oh, buy any, oh, okay.

779
01:58:53,210 --> 01:58:59,300
Well, shit, all right, that's fine.

780
01:58:59,300 --> 01:59:04,750
I think this is a winning team right now.

781
01:59:04,750 --> 01:59:16,819
This looks like a win.

782
01:59:16,819 --> 01:59:21,029
I'm convinced that you're me from another universe.

783
01:59:21,029 --> 01:59:33,479
Not even a win, it's just a draw.

784
01:59:33,479 --> 01:59:36,989
Only three-man, a one-one value is terrible.

785
01:59:36,989 --> 01:59:45,390
Yeah, you're probably right.

786
01:59:45,390 --> 01:59:50,420
No rat.

787
01:59:50,420 --> 01:59:51,439
Ant is really good.

788
01:59:51,439 --> 02:00:06,079
I think we combine fish and get ant.

789
02:00:06,079 --> 02:00:11,319
I think you Leon for the 10 community subs, community subs.

790
02:00:11,319 --> 02:00:12,319
Can we have a face cam?

791
02:00:12,319 --> 02:00:13,920
No, I'm not kidding.

792
02:00:14,560 --> 02:00:16,930
I don't have a t-shirt on.

793
02:00:16,930 --> 02:00:19,050
I rolled out of bed and turned on the stream

794
02:00:19,050 --> 02:00:21,119
like 30 minutes later.

795
02:00:21,119 --> 02:00:25,829
I was up all night studying.

796
02:00:25,829 --> 02:00:31,840
Do I just buff this guy up like crazy to make sure I win?

797
02:00:31,840 --> 02:00:41,479
Well, that's easy.

798
02:00:41,479 --> 02:00:44,560
I think I sell the duck next turn.

799
02:00:44,560 --> 02:00:52,949
If there's a fish, I sell duck.

800
02:00:52,949 --> 02:00:54,270
You sound tired.

801
02:00:54,270 --> 02:00:56,069
Well, this is okay, so for everybody that's asking,

802
02:00:56,069 --> 02:00:58,189
how come, dude, come on, how come you don't start

803
02:00:58,189 --> 02:01:00,390
at like 10, 11 o'clock in the morning?

804
02:01:00,390 --> 02:01:01,949
More people would be able to watch your streams.

805
02:01:01,949 --> 02:01:04,239
What about EU?

806
02:01:04,239 --> 02:01:05,920
I cannot function before noon.

807
02:01:05,920 --> 02:01:07,039
I can't.

808
02:01:07,039 --> 02:01:08,800
Even if I wake up at eight o'clock in the morning,

809
02:01:08,840 --> 02:01:09,680
doesn't matter.

810
02:01:09,680 --> 02:01:14,539
I don't function until at least one, two or three p.m.

811
02:01:14,539 --> 02:01:15,579
Doesn't matter when I go to sleep.

812
02:01:15,579 --> 02:01:18,880
Doesn't matter when I wake up.

813
02:01:18,880 --> 02:01:21,000
So reliably getting up in the morning

814
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:24,579
and doing a live stream at 10 o'clock,

815
02:01:24,579 --> 02:01:27,729
11 o'clock in the morning, which means that, okay,

816
02:01:27,729 --> 02:01:31,630
so that means I have to get up around eight or nine, right?

817
02:01:31,630 --> 02:01:34,149
So get up at eight a.m. and I'm just not a morning person.

818
02:01:34,149 --> 02:01:36,949
I've tried a million times.

819
02:01:36,949 --> 02:01:39,850
It's not gonna happen.

820
02:01:39,850 --> 02:01:42,569
All right, well, let's do this.

821
02:01:42,569 --> 02:01:45,699
Hold on.

822
02:01:45,699 --> 02:01:51,079
I don't want to do this to the duck.

823
02:01:51,119 --> 02:01:53,529
Oh, God damn it.

824
02:01:53,529 --> 02:02:02,819
Can I do a second, should I do level two duck?

825
02:02:02,819 --> 02:02:04,659
Is duck bad?

826
02:02:04,659 --> 02:02:07,130
Should I just not do duck?

827
02:02:07,130 --> 02:02:09,949
Oh, what else we got?

828
02:02:09,949 --> 02:02:10,789
I like swan.

829
02:02:10,789 --> 02:02:14,319
All right, I'm selling duck and I'm getting swan.

830
02:02:14,319 --> 02:02:18,789
Here we go.

831
02:02:18,789 --> 02:02:19,869
Nice.

832
02:02:19,869 --> 02:02:25,920
Here comes the swan and then here comes otter.

833
02:02:25,920 --> 02:02:27,640
Not bad.

834
02:02:27,640 --> 02:02:29,789
Shrimp.

835
02:02:29,789 --> 02:02:34,510
When you sell a friend, give somebody random one health.

836
02:02:34,510 --> 02:02:40,109
This is the only other thing I'd be selling.

837
02:02:40,109 --> 02:02:44,170
Although I could just, okay,

838
02:02:44,170 --> 02:02:46,449
I could kill the ant, give the buff to somebody

839
02:02:46,449 --> 02:02:48,630
and put the shrimp up there.

840
02:02:48,630 --> 02:02:53,779
Because then I'm gonna end up selling the beaver.

841
02:02:56,989 --> 02:02:58,750
I think that's not a bad idea.

842
02:02:58,750 --> 02:02:59,590
Because if I kill the ant,

843
02:02:59,590 --> 02:03:02,869
he'll give the two one to somebody back here

844
02:03:02,869 --> 02:03:03,930
and then I can put the shrimp up.

845
02:03:03,930 --> 02:03:06,239
It's the same stats.

846
02:03:06,239 --> 02:03:08,600
And then eventually I'll get the one health

847
02:03:08,600 --> 02:03:10,840
for selling the beaver.

848
02:03:10,840 --> 02:03:15,409
Shrimp sucks though.

849
02:03:15,409 --> 02:03:19,699
I'm gonna go for it, okay?

850
02:03:19,699 --> 02:03:22,600
I mean, this is gonna be the beefy guy.

851
02:03:22,600 --> 02:03:23,810
What?

852
02:03:23,810 --> 02:03:25,010
Oh, it doesn't sell it.

853
02:03:25,010 --> 02:03:26,529
It just deletes it.

854
02:03:26,529 --> 02:03:27,869
Oh, no.

855
02:03:27,869 --> 02:03:28,710
Oh, no.

856
02:03:28,710 --> 02:03:29,829
It just deletes it.

857
02:03:29,829 --> 02:03:32,260
I thought it sold it too.

858
02:03:32,260 --> 02:03:37,029
Oh, okay.

859
02:03:37,029 --> 02:03:41,170
I thought I was gonna get one gold.

860
02:03:41,170 --> 02:03:42,010
Shit.

861
02:03:42,010 --> 02:03:43,289
No, well, that plan is gone.

862
02:03:43,289 --> 02:03:46,619
No, what's the reason to just roll the shrimp?

863
02:03:46,619 --> 02:03:49,810
Oh, fuck.

864
02:03:49,810 --> 02:03:50,930
And you can control Z?

865
02:03:50,930 --> 02:04:00,079
No, you can't.

866
02:04:00,079 --> 02:04:03,199
Copy the health from the friend in front.

867
02:04:03,199 --> 02:04:04,039
Damn it.

868
02:04:04,039 --> 02:04:08,750
Oh, that's not good.

869
02:04:08,750 --> 02:04:09,989
I like the peacock.

870
02:04:09,989 --> 02:04:13,479
Maybe I'll hold onto the peacock.

871
02:04:13,479 --> 02:04:15,239
Shit.

872
02:04:15,239 --> 02:04:23,550
Well, did you get a spider?

873
02:04:23,550 --> 02:04:27,680
I actually might not lose this.

874
02:04:27,680 --> 02:04:29,159
I only have four as well.

875
02:04:29,159 --> 02:04:32,399
I might actually win this.

876
02:04:32,399 --> 02:04:38,699
Yeah, okay.

877
02:04:38,699 --> 02:04:39,539
Is this a bot?

878
02:04:39,539 --> 02:04:42,449
No.

879
02:04:42,449 --> 02:04:45,770
Please make a joke or do a bit.

880
02:04:45,770 --> 02:04:46,810
I don't think I need to do that

881
02:04:46,810 --> 02:04:48,550
considering the first two hours of the stream

882
02:04:48,550 --> 02:04:51,810
was like a joke.

883
02:04:52,810 --> 02:04:55,489
Honestly, that whole tournament really did feel

884
02:04:55,489 --> 02:05:00,529
like I was in a Mr. Bean movie, just in a video game.

885
02:05:00,529 --> 02:05:02,569
I just was sitting there.

886
02:05:02,569 --> 02:05:04,050
I made every single mistake.

887
02:05:04,050 --> 02:05:05,470
I didn't know there was a timer.

888
02:05:05,470 --> 02:05:11,130
I fucked up the first like three turns.

889
02:05:11,130 --> 02:05:14,390
I'm playing checkers while somebody else is playing chess.

890
02:05:14,390 --> 02:05:17,270
I'm trying to stay in the lines in the coloring book

891
02:05:17,270 --> 02:05:21,529
and they're playing with chess.

892
02:05:21,529 --> 02:05:24,289
I was not, I got thrown off so bad.

893
02:05:24,289 --> 02:05:26,050
Sheep is really good.

894
02:05:26,050 --> 02:05:29,020
We're gonna do sheep.

895
02:05:29,020 --> 02:05:31,710
Wait, hold on.

896
02:05:31,710 --> 02:05:33,430
Sell, give two friends one one.

897
02:05:33,430 --> 02:05:35,750
All right, we're gonna buy the sheep.

898
02:05:35,750 --> 02:05:41,250
We're gonna do the fish.

899
02:05:41,250 --> 02:05:43,640
This would be really good.

900
02:05:43,640 --> 02:05:48,449
Squirrel, buy, clear and fill.

901
02:05:48,449 --> 02:05:51,720
She clears everything and fills the shop with food.

902
02:05:51,720 --> 02:05:56,529
Interesting, okay.

903
02:05:56,529 --> 02:06:00,159
All right, so now that I have a second,

904
02:06:00,159 --> 02:06:02,119
like I can barely kind of explain to people

905
02:06:02,119 --> 02:06:04,880
like what is even going on, I have no idea.

906
02:06:04,880 --> 02:06:08,079
So this game is kind of like auto chess

907
02:06:08,079 --> 02:06:09,779
or like Hearthstone Battlegrounds

908
02:06:09,779 --> 02:06:12,609
or whatever other auto battler.

909
02:06:12,609 --> 02:06:15,029
You have a set of 10 gold at the end

910
02:06:15,029 --> 02:06:17,270
of the beginning of every round,

911
02:06:17,270 --> 02:06:20,050
which everything costs three gold.

912
02:06:21,010 --> 02:06:23,369
It's three gold for me to buy this.

913
02:06:23,369 --> 02:06:28,960
I get 10 gold every round and your goal is to try to,

914
02:06:28,960 --> 02:06:31,920
they all have little things, they're like little perks

915
02:06:31,920 --> 02:06:33,760
and little, if this, then why?

916
02:06:33,760 --> 02:06:35,869
If X, then why?

917
02:06:35,869 --> 02:06:37,949
And you have to try to build up a team eventually

918
02:06:37,949 --> 02:06:42,380
that's strong enough to take you to the end.

919
02:06:42,380 --> 02:06:44,920
They fight on their own just by in order,

920
02:06:44,920 --> 02:06:46,180
one, two, three, four, five.

921
02:06:46,180 --> 02:06:48,939
You can only have five and there's no undo

922
02:06:48,939 --> 02:06:51,500
and you're playing against other players.

923
02:06:51,500 --> 02:06:53,739
Is this like team fight tactics?

924
02:06:53,739 --> 02:06:55,159
I've never played team fight tactics,

925
02:06:55,159 --> 02:06:58,880
but I'm gonna say yes, I'm gonna say yes.

926
02:06:58,880 --> 02:07:01,189
It's like a StarCraft custom map.

927
02:07:01,189 --> 02:07:03,449
Yes, but I don't know if I should buy the squirrel.

928
02:07:03,449 --> 02:07:06,439
Is it time to buy squirrel and just feed somebody?

929
02:07:06,439 --> 02:07:08,649
I don't think so.

930
02:07:08,649 --> 02:07:15,890
What about the peacock?

931
02:07:15,890 --> 02:07:16,729
Hope you're doing great.

932
02:07:16,729 --> 02:07:20,670
I'm doing pretty good, I am.

933
02:07:20,670 --> 02:07:28,060
I think I just re-roll the whole thing.

934
02:07:28,060 --> 02:07:30,960
All right, now we're talking.

935
02:07:30,960 --> 02:07:33,760
Now we're talking, now we've got some synergy.

936
02:07:33,760 --> 02:07:37,550
So the whale swallows something at the beginning of battle,

937
02:07:37,550 --> 02:07:39,840
which is technically killing it.

938
02:07:39,840 --> 02:07:43,079
And then after the whale dies, it spits it out

939
02:07:43,079 --> 02:07:44,800
and it gets to come back as a level one.

940
02:07:44,800 --> 02:07:47,239
So look at that, we have a sheep.

941
02:07:47,239 --> 02:07:50,739
It's going to eat the sheep and summon two rams.

942
02:07:50,739 --> 02:07:53,920
And then when the whale dies, it gets to happen again.

943
02:07:53,920 --> 02:07:56,670
Now we need somebody, we need the dog.

944
02:07:56,670 --> 02:08:00,399
All right, this whole thing has to be redone,

945
02:08:00,399 --> 02:08:02,890
this whole thing.

946
02:08:02,890 --> 02:08:06,970
So I need to get rid of this, everybody pretty much.

947
02:08:06,970 --> 02:08:09,069
Let's get rid of the beaver.

948
02:08:09,069 --> 02:08:12,539
I get it in the right order.

949
02:08:12,539 --> 02:08:16,140
Oh, fish can go, fish, can I buy everybody with the,

950
02:08:16,140 --> 02:08:18,079
let's see, this is two gold, four, five, six.

951
02:08:18,079 --> 02:08:26,079
Okay, I can afford both.

952
02:08:26,079 --> 02:08:30,590
I think the fish, if the fish goes,

953
02:08:30,590 --> 02:08:33,489
which then allows me to get the,

954
02:08:33,529 --> 02:08:35,520
all right, I have to buy the dog first.

955
02:08:35,520 --> 02:08:50,800
So maybe the swan, replace the swan or replace the otter.

956
02:08:50,800 --> 02:08:56,069
Cause the beaver, I mean, five, five versus six, six,

957
02:08:56,069 --> 02:08:58,399
get rid of the otter first.

958
02:08:58,399 --> 02:08:59,880
Yeah, cause then I'm going to do,

959
02:08:59,880 --> 02:09:02,890
okay, we'll get rid of otter.

960
02:09:02,890 --> 02:09:06,829
Now the dog goes up.

961
02:09:06,829 --> 02:09:08,890
Okay, and now the whale comes up,

962
02:09:08,890 --> 02:09:13,210
which will get a benefit from the dog.

963
02:09:13,210 --> 02:09:18,420
There we go.

964
02:09:18,420 --> 02:09:19,939
So I have to make sure this is going to,

965
02:09:19,939 --> 02:09:23,689
so I have to do this, right?

966
02:09:23,689 --> 02:09:26,090
Cause technically you can only have five people up.

967
02:09:26,090 --> 02:09:31,090
So I don't want to have to just be wasted.

968
02:09:31,090 --> 02:09:32,729
Oh, wait a minute, fuck.

969
02:09:35,380 --> 02:09:39,310
Oh wait, this is wrong.

970
02:09:39,310 --> 02:09:41,039
This is wrong.

971
02:09:41,039 --> 02:09:43,489
He does it at the start of the fight.

972
02:09:43,489 --> 02:09:49,039
So he's going to just spit out a two, two ram.

973
02:09:49,039 --> 02:09:52,729
Oh, oh well.

974
02:09:52,729 --> 02:09:55,760
I think it's still going to be all right.

975
02:09:55,760 --> 02:09:58,010
Okay, well we'll do it like this.

976
02:09:58,010 --> 02:10:06,920
Dog is going to start getting buffed.

977
02:10:11,210 --> 02:10:14,909
Okay, well we'll see how it goes.

978
02:10:14,909 --> 02:10:17,439
Still greater in the numbers game, that's true.

979
02:10:17,439 --> 02:10:18,279
This game's really fun.

980
02:10:18,279 --> 02:10:19,899
I'm probably not going to play this that much on stream,

981
02:10:19,899 --> 02:10:22,819
but when I saw Liberty play this,

982
02:10:22,819 --> 02:10:27,119
I was like, that looks cute.

983
02:10:27,119 --> 02:10:27,960
All right, so there it is.

984
02:10:27,960 --> 02:10:28,880
Is he going to get the buff?

985
02:10:28,880 --> 02:10:38,350
Yep.

986
02:10:38,350 --> 02:10:39,170
Where's my second?

987
02:10:39,170 --> 02:10:40,010
Oh, okay, I was like, what?

988
02:10:43,239 --> 02:10:45,399
The dog is just a huge pain in the ass if you have summons,

989
02:10:45,399 --> 02:10:51,199
but I didn't make it.

990
02:10:51,199 --> 02:10:52,159
You know, he can speed it up.

991
02:10:52,159 --> 02:10:57,539
Yeah, but I like to watch.

992
02:10:57,539 --> 02:11:01,920
Another swan.

993
02:11:01,920 --> 02:11:03,520
I could put this guy behind.

994
02:11:03,520 --> 02:11:18,939
Hmm, money on the dog.

995
02:11:18,939 --> 02:11:24,029
Might be time to sell a beaver.

996
02:11:24,029 --> 02:11:26,920
All right, I think I'm going to sell beaver,

997
02:11:26,920 --> 02:11:33,420
upgrade swan, sneeze directly into the microphone.

998
02:11:33,420 --> 02:11:34,260
Ah!

999
02:11:38,720 --> 02:11:46,979
After that, probably, did I even freeze the turtle?

1000
02:11:46,979 --> 02:11:48,340
Well, I know I'm doing this,

1001
02:11:48,340 --> 02:11:50,250
but I don't want to, hold on.

1002
02:11:50,250 --> 02:11:53,520
Let's do this first.

1003
02:11:53,520 --> 02:11:54,779
The dog gets a benefit from this,

1004
02:11:54,779 --> 02:12:05,939
so it has to be on the swan, maybe.

1005
02:12:05,939 --> 02:12:08,170
Okay, good.

1006
02:12:08,170 --> 02:12:14,930
Now, this can really start to stack up,

1007
02:12:14,930 --> 02:12:18,079
especially behind here or behind him.

1008
02:12:18,079 --> 02:12:20,239
Ox behind whale,

1009
02:12:20,239 --> 02:12:22,079
because anytime somebody ahead of the ox dies,

1010
02:12:22,079 --> 02:12:28,539
he gets a divine shield and two attack.

1011
02:12:28,539 --> 02:12:32,250
I feel like that's really good.

1012
02:12:32,250 --> 02:12:37,819
Or should I not do that and try to find more summons?

1013
02:12:37,819 --> 02:12:40,140
It only applies to the person directly in front of them.

1014
02:12:40,140 --> 02:12:46,050
Oh, that's right.

1015
02:12:46,050 --> 02:12:56,489
Swan will, I think behind here.

1016
02:12:56,489 --> 02:12:57,409
I'm going to, let me, hold on.

1017
02:12:57,409 --> 02:12:58,369
Let me see if there's anything else.

1018
02:12:58,369 --> 02:13:02,479
I know I'm doing this.

1019
02:13:02,479 --> 02:13:03,680
Just a constant stream of money,

1020
02:13:03,680 --> 02:13:07,560
especially if it's too gold around, that's a big deal.

1021
02:13:07,560 --> 02:13:08,760
Let me freeze this.

1022
02:13:08,760 --> 02:13:13,710
Let's just go for something else.

1023
02:13:13,710 --> 02:13:18,829
I don't know if I even want the turtle.

1024
02:13:18,829 --> 02:13:19,829
Ox and salad.

1025
02:13:19,829 --> 02:13:31,949
Yeah, it's too late.

1026
02:13:31,949 --> 02:13:37,569
Let's try this.

1027
02:13:37,569 --> 02:13:40,189
Let's see if this works.

1028
02:13:40,189 --> 02:13:43,859
Herman hates Elden Ring.

1029
02:13:43,859 --> 02:13:44,880
I was going to just go off

1030
02:13:44,880 --> 02:13:46,239
and I'm going to fake elaborate story

1031
02:13:46,239 --> 02:13:47,640
of why I think it's the worst souls game,

1032
02:13:47,640 --> 02:14:00,720
but why would I do that?

1033
02:14:00,720 --> 02:14:02,260
Okay, here we go.

1034
02:14:02,260 --> 02:14:04,710
This is where this makes sense here.

1035
02:14:04,710 --> 02:14:08,420
He dies, so he's going to get the buff.

1036
02:14:08,420 --> 02:14:11,319
This sheep dies, two sheep come out.

1037
02:14:11,319 --> 02:14:14,659
Perfect.

1038
02:14:14,659 --> 02:14:15,539
Yeah, all right.

1039
02:14:15,539 --> 02:14:16,359
This is going to work out,

1040
02:14:16,359 --> 02:14:20,630
as long as I level them up and beef them up a little bit.

1041
02:14:20,670 --> 02:14:26,029
I think he might have better stuff though.

1042
02:14:26,029 --> 02:14:28,050
I'll kill the first two.

1043
02:14:28,050 --> 02:14:29,500
No, this is a win.

1044
02:14:29,500 --> 02:14:30,560
Shit, no, it's not.

1045
02:14:30,560 --> 02:14:32,680
Damn it, come on.

1046
02:14:32,680 --> 02:14:34,239
He had garlic armor on.

1047
02:14:34,239 --> 02:14:47,680
Ah, no, it's still, it's a draw.

1048
02:14:47,680 --> 02:14:54,050
Ooh, monkey is so good.

1049
02:14:54,050 --> 02:14:56,970
Give the rightmost friend two, two every time you,

1050
02:14:56,970 --> 02:15:03,619
and every time you like go to a battle.

1051
02:15:03,619 --> 02:15:12,319
I think it's time to get rid of the, I don't know.

1052
02:15:12,319 --> 02:15:13,159
Who does this replace?

1053
02:15:13,159 --> 02:15:15,520
The dog?

1054
02:15:15,520 --> 02:15:24,119
The dog's kind of fallen off, or the swan maybe.

1055
02:15:24,119 --> 02:15:24,960
What does the one for do?

1056
02:15:24,960 --> 02:15:26,479
So every time some,

1057
02:15:26,479 --> 02:15:29,520
the character directly in front of the ox,

1058
02:15:29,520 --> 02:15:34,600
when it dies, he gets plus two attack and melon armor,

1059
02:15:34,600 --> 02:15:37,520
which means you can take at least 20 damage one time.

1060
02:15:37,520 --> 02:15:44,720
It's like a shield, like divine shield.

1061
02:15:44,720 --> 02:15:46,510
We need to buff this guy.

1062
02:15:46,510 --> 02:15:47,350
All right, let's see.

1063
02:15:47,350 --> 02:15:50,800
Okay, we're going to make a decision based on this.

1064
02:15:50,800 --> 02:15:51,640
All right, nice.

1065
02:15:51,640 --> 02:15:55,060
That's exactly what I wanted.

1066
02:15:55,060 --> 02:16:03,520
I think it's time to get rid of this one.

1067
02:16:03,520 --> 02:16:07,090
Yeah.

1068
02:16:16,300 --> 02:16:27,470
Okay, now I need garlic armor or something.

1069
02:16:27,470 --> 02:16:29,220
Ooh, ooh, here we go.

1070
02:16:29,220 --> 02:16:31,579
Okay.

1071
02:16:31,579 --> 02:16:33,280
The hippo is actually really good.

1072
02:16:33,280 --> 02:16:34,500
When you, if you kill somebody with the hippo,

1073
02:16:34,500 --> 02:16:35,340
you just get two, two.

1074
02:16:35,340 --> 02:16:36,500
You just keep doing over and over and over

1075
02:16:36,500 --> 02:16:42,159
and over and over again.

1076
02:16:42,159 --> 02:16:46,440
Monkey buff's going to get wasted on the sheep.

1077
02:16:46,440 --> 02:16:55,799
Should I have the monkey just give it to himself?

1078
02:16:55,799 --> 02:17:05,340
Cause I want the hippo eventually to be here.

1079
02:17:05,340 --> 02:17:07,260
I think we, I think I'm actually just probably

1080
02:17:07,260 --> 02:17:18,260
going to get rid of the sheep and the dog maybe.

1081
02:17:18,260 --> 02:17:22,100
Well, let's just roll.

1082
02:17:22,100 --> 02:17:25,700
Yeah, I mean, the dog is good.

1083
02:17:25,700 --> 02:17:27,020
It's the ox for the hippo.

1084
02:17:27,020 --> 02:17:29,370
Yeah, that's probably the play.

1085
02:17:29,370 --> 02:17:40,700
We'll do that next time.

1086
02:17:40,700 --> 02:17:42,219
Cause I want the monkey to buff the hippo.

1087
02:17:42,219 --> 02:17:44,590
Oh my God, I'm going to lose.

1088
02:17:44,590 --> 02:17:45,549
Holy fucking shit.

1089
02:17:45,549 --> 02:17:57,129
Are you kidding me?

1090
02:17:57,129 --> 02:18:07,020
This is a disaster.

1091
02:18:07,020 --> 02:18:10,899
What episode of the let's play is this?

1092
02:18:10,899 --> 02:18:19,139
I don't know, 200?

1093
02:18:19,139 --> 02:18:21,729
What's the title mean?

1094
02:18:22,569 --> 02:18:23,409
What does it say?

1095
02:18:23,409 --> 02:18:25,450
Oh, free space bingo perspective.

1096
02:18:25,450 --> 02:18:27,370
Yeah, but that means I'm the free space.

1097
02:18:27,370 --> 02:18:29,569
Whoever is playing against me in the tournament,

1098
02:18:29,569 --> 02:18:31,430
I'm the free space.

1099
02:18:31,430 --> 02:18:35,340
Like you're just pretty much guaranteed to win.

1100
02:18:35,340 --> 02:18:36,180
All right, let me get this right.

1101
02:18:36,180 --> 02:18:38,889
We're going dog.

1102
02:18:38,889 --> 02:18:40,090
I'm keeping the dog.

1103
02:18:40,090 --> 02:18:44,100
Getting rid of the ox, right?

1104
02:18:44,100 --> 02:18:45,219
Yes, yes.

1105
02:18:45,219 --> 02:18:47,819
Get rid of the ox.

1106
02:18:47,819 --> 02:18:52,110
Hippo going in front.

1107
02:18:52,110 --> 02:19:00,629
And then we're going to garlic the hippo.

1108
02:19:00,629 --> 02:19:06,739
And then we're going to go like this.

1109
02:19:06,739 --> 02:19:08,500
And that's a leveled up dog.

1110
02:19:08,500 --> 02:19:09,889
Next round.

1111
02:19:09,930 --> 02:19:11,420
Oh wait, I have to live.

1112
02:19:11,420 --> 02:19:15,090
I actually have to survive otherwise.

1113
02:19:15,090 --> 02:19:22,159
Why are you commentating like it's a grand strategy?

1114
02:19:22,159 --> 02:19:23,770
You know what?

1115
02:19:23,770 --> 02:19:26,100
I'm a nice guy.

1116
02:19:26,100 --> 02:19:28,739
I'm a nice person.

1117
02:19:28,739 --> 02:19:30,950
But when somebody comes in here

1118
02:19:30,950 --> 02:19:32,389
and I'm a good guy, right?

1119
02:19:32,389 --> 02:19:34,180
I'm a nice guy.

1120
02:19:34,180 --> 02:19:37,370
But if you come in and just kind of talk shit to me,

1121
02:19:37,370 --> 02:19:38,930
nice guy drops.

1122
02:19:38,930 --> 02:19:41,409
And then you will watch out, here comes the mad guy.

1123
02:19:41,409 --> 02:19:42,850
Here comes, you know what I mean?

1124
02:19:42,850 --> 02:19:55,040
Like I'm a good guy, I'm a nice guy.

1125
02:19:55,040 --> 02:19:55,879
Do I want to say anything else?

1126
02:19:55,879 --> 02:19:58,920
No, roll.

1127
02:19:58,920 --> 02:20:00,600
All right, come on, please survive this round.

1128
02:20:00,600 --> 02:20:05,620
Come on Hippo, please survive.

1129
02:20:05,620 --> 02:20:06,899
I don't think the hippo is going to survive.

1130
02:20:06,899 --> 02:20:08,899
Maybe because of the two, two.

1131
02:20:08,899 --> 02:20:16,809
Look, this is going to take off if I live the next round.

1132
02:20:16,809 --> 02:20:24,459
Okay, come on, let's go.

1133
02:20:24,459 --> 02:20:26,100
Don't get on my bad side.

1134
02:20:26,100 --> 02:20:27,459
Yeah, look, chat.

1135
02:20:27,459 --> 02:20:29,489
I'm a nice guy.

1136
02:20:29,489 --> 02:20:31,290
But don't like, you know, you get me riled up

1137
02:20:31,290 --> 02:20:32,250
and you get me pissed off.

1138
02:20:32,250 --> 02:20:34,450
Like, you know, don't get me fucking mad and everything.

1139
02:20:34,450 --> 02:20:35,290
You know what I mean?

1140
02:20:35,290 --> 02:20:36,280
I'm a nice guy.

1141
02:20:36,280 --> 02:20:37,120
I'm nice to people.

1142
02:20:37,120 --> 02:20:37,959
I'm not a fucking dick.

1143
02:20:37,959 --> 02:20:38,780
I'm not a bad guy.

1144
02:20:38,780 --> 02:20:41,340
I'm a nice person.

1145
02:20:41,340 --> 02:20:45,680
I actually might survive.

1146
02:20:45,680 --> 02:20:51,329
Oh, no, come on.

1147
02:20:51,329 --> 02:20:56,409
No, I don't live.

1148
02:20:56,409 --> 02:20:58,450
He's got a 21, 16 dog.

1149
02:20:59,129 --> 02:21:00,049
Dog's level two.

1150
02:21:00,049 --> 02:21:03,489
God damn it.

1151
02:21:03,489 --> 02:21:13,399
Oh well.

1152
02:21:13,399 --> 02:21:14,920
No, I'm a nice person.

1153
02:21:14,920 --> 02:21:15,760
Okay.

1154
02:21:15,760 --> 02:21:27,620
I do nice things for people.

1155
02:21:27,620 --> 02:21:29,309
It's like, okay.

1156
02:21:29,309 --> 02:21:30,129
All right.

1157
02:21:30,129 --> 02:21:31,899
So what's your point?

1158
02:21:31,899 --> 02:21:42,620
What are you talking about?

1159
02:21:42,620 --> 02:21:44,059
You're doing an extended bit here.

1160
02:21:44,059 --> 02:21:49,809
This is not a bit.

1161
02:21:49,809 --> 02:21:51,090
All right, parasocial Andy.

1162
02:21:51,090 --> 02:21:52,770
Don't let it get under your skin.

1163
02:21:52,770 --> 02:21:54,680
How dare you?

1164
02:21:54,680 --> 02:21:59,030
How dare you say something like that to me?

1165
02:21:59,030 --> 02:22:02,250
You're lucky I'm a fucking nice guy, okay.

1166
02:22:02,250 --> 02:22:03,969
I, how did I lose the first round?

1167
02:22:03,969 --> 02:22:18,549
What?

1168
02:22:23,659 --> 02:22:24,799
Oh, God damn it.

1169
02:22:24,799 --> 02:22:28,319
I need to, okay.

1170
02:22:28,319 --> 02:22:35,790
I'm just gonna, I'm being a weirdo.

1171
02:22:35,790 --> 02:22:41,260
This should work.

1172
02:22:41,260 --> 02:22:44,459
Do I level up one of these two or do I just feed someone?

1173
02:22:44,459 --> 02:23:05,590
Probably just level up the beaver.

1174
02:23:05,590 --> 02:23:07,069
Come on.

1175
02:23:07,069 --> 02:23:19,120
No, I think I still, yeah, I still got it.

1176
02:23:19,120 --> 02:23:19,959
Are you this bad?

1177
02:23:19,959 --> 02:23:27,459
I just won the match.

1178
02:23:27,459 --> 02:23:29,219
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

1179
02:23:29,219 --> 02:23:34,260
No, I don't want the dog.

1180
02:23:34,260 --> 02:23:36,739
Do I kill ant?

1181
02:23:36,739 --> 02:23:42,510
Maybe.

1182
02:23:42,510 --> 02:23:44,520
Oh God, okay.

1183
02:23:44,520 --> 02:23:50,020
So the play here is I'm gonna make a level three ant,

1184
02:23:50,020 --> 02:23:55,879
sell this ant, like just get the,

1185
02:23:55,879 --> 02:23:59,920
okay, let's combine the ant, one of them,

1186
02:23:59,920 --> 02:24:03,819
get another one.

1187
02:24:03,819 --> 02:24:05,780
Ooh, yeah, all right.

1188
02:24:05,780 --> 02:24:08,870
That's really good.

1189
02:24:08,870 --> 02:24:12,209
Play kangaroo, kill ant,

1190
02:24:12,209 --> 02:24:15,059
or play kangaroo, kill ant next turn

1191
02:24:15,059 --> 02:24:34,280
and give food to kangaroo.

1192
02:24:34,280 --> 02:24:38,420
Yeah, I'll do it next turn.

1193
02:24:38,420 --> 02:24:41,719
No, I, no, whoa.

1194
02:24:41,719 --> 02:24:43,540
No, I wanted to move him.

1195
02:24:43,540 --> 02:24:45,940
I wanted to move him to the front.

1196
02:24:45,940 --> 02:24:48,200
I wanted to move him to the front.

1197
02:24:48,200 --> 02:24:53,059
Oh, yeah.

1198
02:24:53,059 --> 02:24:54,520
I want, whatever.

1199
02:24:54,520 --> 02:24:55,399
Come on.

1200
02:24:55,760 --> 02:25:01,649
I was trying to move him.

1201
02:25:01,649 --> 02:25:08,450
I think I'm all right.

1202
02:25:08,450 --> 02:25:20,579
That's a crock of shit right there if I've ever seen one.

1203
02:25:20,579 --> 02:25:25,090
Oh my God, he got melon armor.

1204
02:25:25,090 --> 02:25:29,690
That just made you win unironically.

1205
02:25:29,690 --> 02:25:30,850
Oh, look, it doesn't even matter

1206
02:25:30,850 --> 02:25:34,260
because I can just buy this and kill it.

1207
02:25:34,260 --> 02:25:41,299
We're not doing that right now though, hold on.

1208
02:25:41,299 --> 02:25:46,920
Ah, interesting.

1209
02:25:46,920 --> 02:25:48,600
Come on, the worst one,

1210
02:25:48,600 --> 02:25:52,100
the worst tier three pet that you could have given me.

1211
02:25:52,100 --> 02:25:54,309
The worst one.

1212
02:25:54,309 --> 02:25:57,510
All right, I'm a nice guy.

1213
02:25:57,510 --> 02:25:59,670
But when I see shit like this that I don't like,

1214
02:25:59,670 --> 02:26:02,110
it really, it gets me fucking a little pissed off

1215
02:26:02,469 --> 02:26:04,889
and it makes me, I'll talk about it for a little while.

1216
02:26:04,889 --> 02:26:06,170
I hate to say this kind of shit

1217
02:26:06,170 --> 02:26:07,450
to somebody that like, I like to call myself

1218
02:26:07,450 --> 02:26:23,280
like a good person, but everybody hates me.

1219
02:26:23,280 --> 02:26:24,790
No, these suck.

1220
02:26:24,790 --> 02:26:34,159
I can't use the dog right now.

1221
02:26:34,159 --> 02:26:36,879
Oh, listen, he's a nice guy.

1222
02:26:36,879 --> 02:26:41,639
There we go, dodo, freeze.

1223
02:26:41,639 --> 02:26:49,200
Nice guys can get pissed off too, relax.

1224
02:26:49,200 --> 02:26:51,799
Because of boomer rant?

1225
02:26:51,799 --> 02:26:54,700
What do you, what?

1226
02:26:54,700 --> 02:26:57,899
Dodo, guys, I'm gonna sell the beaver

1227
02:26:57,899 --> 02:27:01,700
and the dodo is gonna get extra points.

1228
02:27:01,700 --> 02:27:03,809
That's a swan meadow, look at that.

1229
02:27:03,809 --> 02:27:10,159
Wow, I didn't even know how you did this.

1230
02:27:10,200 --> 02:27:18,379
Like how?

1231
02:27:18,379 --> 02:27:20,260
I think that's a win it is.

1232
02:27:32,959 --> 02:27:35,649
Okay, if I sell, oh shit.

1233
02:27:35,649 --> 02:27:39,209
Okay, it's random friends up here.

1234
02:27:39,209 --> 02:27:41,450
All right, this is where we do the thing that I wanted to do.

1235
02:27:41,450 --> 02:27:45,139
We're gonna sell, we're gonna kill the ant.

1236
02:27:45,139 --> 02:27:46,139
Give it to the kangaroo.

1237
02:27:56,049 --> 02:27:57,250
Mosquito is worthless now too.

1238
02:27:57,250 --> 02:27:59,479
All right, who do I replace?

1239
02:27:59,479 --> 02:28:00,879
I know I got to buff up the dodo.

1240
02:28:00,879 --> 02:28:03,920
So we're definitely gonna buy the dodo.

1241
02:28:03,920 --> 02:28:06,170
And I'm just gonna do this too.

1242
02:28:06,170 --> 02:28:08,649
Wait, no, hold on.

1243
02:28:08,649 --> 02:28:16,940
Get rid of the mosquito for maybe even the beaver.

1244
02:28:16,940 --> 02:28:18,420
The giraffe will buff the dodo.

1245
02:28:19,260 --> 02:28:24,760
Okay, let's do that.

1246
02:28:24,760 --> 02:28:25,600
The giraffe is gonna buff the dodo

1247
02:28:25,600 --> 02:28:28,549
who in turn is gonna buff the kangaroo

1248
02:28:28,549 --> 02:28:34,700
who in turn is going to, all right, that's fine.

1249
02:28:34,700 --> 02:28:40,670
I think everyone needs to move up a little bit though.

1250
02:28:40,670 --> 02:28:46,920
In turn, give one start of battle, give it to, okay.

1251
02:28:46,920 --> 02:28:50,739
And I'm gonna do this.

1252
02:28:50,739 --> 02:28:52,000
That's what I would like to call a pogchamp.

1253
02:28:52,000 --> 02:28:53,760
But if I don't see at least 500 pogchamps

1254
02:28:53,760 --> 02:28:56,659
in the chat right now, I'm gonna scream.

1255
02:28:56,659 --> 02:28:59,500
This is loud as I fucking can.

1256
02:28:59,500 --> 02:29:00,579
Sell the fucking beaver.

1257
02:29:00,579 --> 02:29:15,399
Next round, boom, boom.

1258
02:29:15,399 --> 02:29:16,520
Oh, this person has a background.

1259
02:29:16,520 --> 02:29:25,069
I know what they're doing.

1260
02:29:25,069 --> 02:29:28,319
All right, come on.

1261
02:29:28,319 --> 02:29:29,319
Not bad so far.

1262
02:29:29,319 --> 02:29:32,059
This dog is really scary.

1263
02:29:32,059 --> 02:29:35,370
I'll make it to the dog.

1264
02:29:35,370 --> 02:29:43,670
All right, we're good.

1265
02:29:43,670 --> 02:29:45,649
Very nice.

1266
02:29:45,649 --> 02:29:46,850
Okay, I gotta do this in the right order.

1267
02:29:46,850 --> 02:29:50,680
Sell the beaver.

1268
02:29:50,680 --> 02:29:51,639
Don't sell the beaver yet

1269
02:29:51,639 --> 02:29:58,440
because I need to give garlic to the kangaroo.

1270
02:29:58,440 --> 02:30:05,120
And that means now I can sell the beaver,

1271
02:30:05,120 --> 02:30:06,719
which will give two health to two people.

1272
02:30:06,719 --> 02:30:14,639
I'm really hoping it hits the kangaroo.

1273
02:30:14,639 --> 02:30:15,459
That's perfect.

1274
02:30:15,459 --> 02:30:18,750
That's almost precisely what I wanted.

1275
02:30:18,750 --> 02:30:21,750
Rabbit now, if a friend eats a shop food,

1276
02:30:21,750 --> 02:30:27,700
they get plus one health.

1277
02:30:27,700 --> 02:30:33,110
I wonder, that's probably good.

1278
02:30:33,110 --> 02:30:34,590
I need to feed somebody something.

1279
02:30:34,590 --> 02:30:36,030
I'm gonna feed the dodo the garlic

1280
02:30:36,030 --> 02:30:40,219
and that should be plus one health as well.

1281
02:30:40,219 --> 02:30:46,260
Let me try to get some.

1282
02:30:46,260 --> 02:30:47,620
All right, I have to do this

1283
02:30:47,620 --> 02:30:54,149
because it's a sure thing.

1284
02:30:54,149 --> 02:30:55,030
Okay, good.

1285
02:30:55,030 --> 02:30:59,129
Freeze that.

1286
02:30:59,129 --> 02:31:01,489
Get another roll.

1287
02:31:01,489 --> 02:31:02,729
That's another bunny.

1288
02:31:02,729 --> 02:31:04,010
And I'm gonna freeze the snail too

1289
02:31:04,010 --> 02:31:07,020
because if I lose the next battle,

1290
02:31:07,020 --> 02:31:08,540
then I just have to put him up there

1291
02:31:08,540 --> 02:31:09,899
and he gives two, one to everybody

1292
02:31:09,899 --> 02:31:11,639
and then you just sell them.

1293
02:31:11,639 --> 02:31:14,579
All right, this is looking good.

1294
02:31:14,579 --> 02:31:15,399
All right, let's go.

1295
02:31:15,399 --> 02:31:21,219
I think this should be all right.

1296
02:31:21,219 --> 02:31:26,959
Is this the guy that wore the snuggie?

1297
02:31:26,959 --> 02:31:30,209
This is a loss probably, we'll see.

1298
02:31:30,209 --> 02:31:36,420
Garlic armor is on the crabs.

1299
02:31:36,420 --> 02:31:39,100
Although I think the kangaroo is gonna carry.

1300
02:31:39,100 --> 02:31:40,899
Yep, that's a kangaroo carry right there.

1301
02:31:40,899 --> 02:31:43,000
Bingo.

1302
02:31:43,000 --> 02:31:45,100
Do I have enough to kill the next two?

1303
02:31:45,100 --> 02:31:48,620
Yeah.

1304
02:31:48,620 --> 02:31:49,479
Oh shit.

1305
02:31:49,479 --> 02:32:00,930
That was actually closer than it could, wow.

1306
02:32:00,930 --> 02:32:01,770
I won that.

1307
02:32:01,770 --> 02:32:11,719
So unfortunately, I'm gonna hold on to the snail though.

1308
02:32:11,719 --> 02:32:14,270
Give me another bunny.

1309
02:32:14,270 --> 02:32:16,510
Okay, so if somebody eats food, they get plus one.

1310
02:32:16,510 --> 02:32:19,430
So this is just gonna give them two people plus one plus one.

1311
02:32:19,430 --> 02:32:23,299
So it's gonna be just doubled up on the health.

1312
02:32:23,299 --> 02:32:25,459
Oh, oh my God, couldn't have been better than that.

1313
02:32:25,459 --> 02:32:30,479
You could not have even given me a better one.

1314
02:32:30,559 --> 02:32:31,399
What do you think?

1315
02:32:31,399 --> 02:32:34,049
Should I just get the ant, level up the ant?

1316
02:32:34,049 --> 02:32:34,930
What's my favorite soda?

1317
02:32:34,930 --> 02:32:43,860
It varies, seven up.

1318
02:32:43,860 --> 02:32:48,100
And then roll it.

1319
02:32:48,100 --> 02:32:50,540
All right, so in case I lose, I have an opportunity here.

1320
02:32:50,540 --> 02:32:56,159
So I think this is gonna start to stack.

1321
02:32:56,159 --> 02:33:01,280
Kill the dodo, why would I do that?

1322
02:33:01,280 --> 02:33:13,889
That's a level three ant, which is awesome.

1323
02:33:13,889 --> 02:33:15,049
Watching any new shows?

1324
02:33:15,049 --> 02:33:23,399
Not really, not really.

1325
02:33:23,399 --> 02:33:24,920
Give it to the kangaroo.

1326
02:33:24,920 --> 02:33:31,030
Ah, it's all right, spread it out a little bit.

1327
02:33:31,030 --> 02:33:38,440
That's a loss.

1328
02:33:38,440 --> 02:33:41,629
That's okay, that's fine.

1329
02:33:41,629 --> 02:33:44,989
I got a big, oh yeah, this is a big play here.

1330
02:33:44,989 --> 02:33:48,969
So I lost, let me think this through.

1331
02:33:48,969 --> 02:33:50,809
Okay, hear me out for a second.

1332
02:33:50,809 --> 02:33:56,840
What if I get the ant to level three, kill the ant,

1333
02:33:56,840 --> 02:34:05,350
do the snail, and then give food to kangaroo?

1334
02:34:05,350 --> 02:34:06,879
What do you think?

1335
02:34:06,879 --> 02:34:11,100
Sell the giraffe first?

1336
02:34:11,100 --> 02:34:18,899
Do not do the snail, sell the giraffe.

1337
02:34:18,899 --> 02:34:19,899
All right, well, I know for a fact

1338
02:34:19,899 --> 02:34:27,350
I'm gonna do this at least, like this is a fact.

1339
02:34:27,350 --> 02:34:31,000
I want him to have more health.

1340
02:34:31,000 --> 02:34:40,819
So now sell the giraffe, I sell giraffe,

1341
02:34:40,819 --> 02:34:50,059
then the ant up here, then put the snail up there.

1342
02:34:50,059 --> 02:34:53,530
Well, let's see what we get for the triple.

1343
02:34:53,530 --> 02:34:55,760
That's a fucking Thanksgiving turkey.

1344
02:34:55,760 --> 02:34:59,899
That's too bad that I don't have anything to summon.

1345
02:34:59,899 --> 02:35:02,059
Otherwise, cause this is one of the best,

1346
02:35:02,059 --> 02:35:03,420
this is one of the best cards in the game.

1347
02:35:03,420 --> 02:35:04,979
And I say that cause all I play is Hearthstone,

1348
02:35:04,979 --> 02:35:08,649
it's the only thing I know.

1349
02:35:08,649 --> 02:35:10,469
Summon, there's one here I know,

1350
02:35:10,469 --> 02:35:12,209
but like I'd have to throw away this whole party

1351
02:35:12,209 --> 02:35:17,680
and I like what's going on right now.

1352
02:35:17,680 --> 02:35:19,629
So what's more valuable?

1353
02:35:19,629 --> 02:35:22,909
Giving everybody right now on this whole team to one,

1354
02:35:22,909 --> 02:35:27,360
everyone, or throw away the rabbit,

1355
02:35:27,360 --> 02:35:34,979
get the turkey and the sheep.

1356
02:35:34,979 --> 02:35:45,469
I think snail is, I think it's snail.

1357
02:35:45,469 --> 02:35:53,319
And then I can sell the snail and put the sheep up.

1358
02:35:53,319 --> 02:36:06,989
Or should I do the deer, put the turkey up?

1359
02:36:06,989 --> 02:36:10,879
I think I like that.

1360
02:36:10,879 --> 02:36:12,100
Yeah, cause the bus has splash damage.

1361
02:36:12,100 --> 02:36:19,620
All right, so now the ant go first

1362
02:36:19,620 --> 02:36:25,270
cause the ant could give the six, three to the deer.

1363
02:36:25,270 --> 02:36:28,280
No, all right.

1364
02:36:28,280 --> 02:36:29,959
Now this is a big deal

1365
02:36:29,959 --> 02:36:31,559
cause he's going to give him seven attack.

1366
02:36:31,559 --> 02:36:32,520
This is huge.

1367
02:36:32,520 --> 02:36:37,069
The Dodo is huge.

1368
02:36:37,069 --> 02:36:39,760
All right, what's it going to go?

1369
02:36:39,760 --> 02:36:41,120
I freeze these both.

1370
02:36:41,120 --> 02:36:42,120
Hmm, I don't even,

1371
02:36:42,120 --> 02:36:46,770
I don't think I'm doing the summon thing right now.

1372
02:36:46,770 --> 02:36:50,799
I'll think about it.

1373
02:36:50,799 --> 02:36:52,000
Is this game actually fun?

1374
02:36:52,000 --> 02:36:53,719
Yeah, this is not like sponsored or anything.

1375
02:36:53,719 --> 02:36:55,430
Ludwig just said,

1376
02:36:55,430 --> 02:36:58,100
he was wondering if I wanted just to play in the tournament.

1377
02:36:58,100 --> 02:37:00,319
I was like, sure, why not?

1378
02:37:00,319 --> 02:37:03,110
This is a big deal cause he's going to knock this armor off.

1379
02:37:03,110 --> 02:37:05,790
This is huge.

1380
02:37:05,790 --> 02:37:11,370
That's a huge deal.

1381
02:37:11,370 --> 02:37:20,530
Now we need the kangaroo to carry.

1382
02:37:20,530 --> 02:37:28,040
All right, this is a win.

1383
02:37:28,040 --> 02:37:32,069
You ever going to play this again after this stream?

1384
02:37:32,069 --> 02:37:37,159
I mean, I don't know.

1385
02:37:37,159 --> 02:37:38,000
Oh shit.

1386
02:37:38,000 --> 02:37:40,909
All right, it's decision time.

1387
02:37:40,909 --> 02:37:43,370
Is it time to sell the ant,

1388
02:37:43,370 --> 02:37:45,690
give somebody a six, three permanently,

1389
02:37:45,690 --> 02:37:53,180
hopefully not the bunny.

1390
02:37:53,180 --> 02:37:58,809
Okay, do I sell bunny first, put turkey up,

1391
02:37:58,809 --> 02:38:05,850
get rid of ant.

1392
02:38:05,850 --> 02:38:10,340
But unfortunately I can't go over 10 gold, can I?

1393
02:38:10,340 --> 02:38:11,819
Oh, you can go over 10.

1394
02:38:11,819 --> 02:38:16,229
I thought you couldn't go over 10 unless, okay.

1395
02:38:16,229 --> 02:38:20,979
All right, turkey goes up, build the ant.

1396
02:38:20,979 --> 02:38:22,180
All right, I need something good here.

1397
02:38:22,180 --> 02:38:27,000
I want this to go on the kangaroo so bad.

1398
02:38:27,000 --> 02:38:28,920
Oh, right.

1399
02:38:28,920 --> 02:38:31,059
I did that in wrong order, you're right.

1400
02:38:31,059 --> 02:38:31,899
Oh no, okay.

1401
02:38:31,899 --> 02:38:33,100
Well, it's still a one out of three.

1402
02:38:33,100 --> 02:38:33,940
It was a 50, 50.

1403
02:38:33,940 --> 02:38:36,620
Fuck, it's all right.

1404
02:38:36,620 --> 02:38:42,520
Shit, it's all right.

1405
02:38:42,520 --> 02:38:44,010
Yeah.

1406
02:38:44,010 --> 02:38:48,209
Now we put the sheep up here.

1407
02:38:48,209 --> 02:38:49,409
Now we're in business.

1408
02:38:49,409 --> 02:38:56,260
We are in big business now.

1409
02:38:56,260 --> 02:38:57,899
Because this is gonna give, to anything summoned,

1410
02:38:57,899 --> 02:39:02,190
that includes the car.

1411
02:39:02,190 --> 02:39:05,559
So anybody that's summoned gets three, three.

1412
02:39:05,559 --> 02:39:07,639
This is gonna be okay.

1413
02:39:07,639 --> 02:39:09,110
I still have money.

1414
02:39:09,110 --> 02:39:10,569
What do I wanna do with my last bit of money?

1415
02:39:10,569 --> 02:39:14,559
Let's see, let's roll.

1416
02:39:14,559 --> 02:39:17,219
All right, this is, okay.

1417
02:39:17,219 --> 02:39:19,559
Really, really good.

1418
02:39:19,559 --> 02:39:21,250
Very good for me.

1419
02:39:21,250 --> 02:39:24,399
I'm gonna freeze.

1420
02:39:24,399 --> 02:39:32,530
Do I just use the dodo now or use the food?

1421
02:39:32,530 --> 02:39:38,540
Yeah, buy the dodo now.

1422
02:39:38,540 --> 02:39:39,899
I'm gonna hold onto these

1423
02:39:39,899 --> 02:39:42,540
because I wanna give it to, I don't know, maybe somebody.

1424
02:39:42,540 --> 02:39:45,590
All right, nice.

1425
02:39:45,590 --> 02:39:46,610
Level the deer up.

1426
02:39:46,610 --> 02:39:54,420
I don't think I'm doing the turtle.

1427
02:39:54,420 --> 02:39:55,260
What does freezing do?

1428
02:39:55,260 --> 02:39:56,299
Freezing means that you're guaranteeing

1429
02:39:56,299 --> 02:39:58,879
that that will show up next turn.

1430
02:39:58,879 --> 02:39:59,719
So it doesn't go away.

1431
02:39:59,719 --> 02:40:05,340
It doesn't get rolled out.

1432
02:40:05,340 --> 02:40:09,100
That is a monster back there, that kangaroo.

1433
02:40:09,100 --> 02:40:11,850
Beautiful, beautiful.

1434
02:40:11,850 --> 02:40:13,899
More splash damage, beautiful.

1435
02:40:13,899 --> 02:40:20,430
Four, beautiful.

1436
02:40:20,430 --> 02:40:24,030
Oh shit, but this thing is murdering people.

1437
02:40:24,030 --> 02:40:28,069
What was going on there?

1438
02:40:28,069 --> 02:40:29,149
I still win.

1439
02:40:29,149 --> 02:40:30,389
What the hell?

1440
02:40:30,389 --> 02:40:31,870
That thing was doing so much damage.

1441
02:40:31,870 --> 02:40:41,799
Is it gonna unhurt?

1442
02:40:41,799 --> 02:40:42,920
Can't do that.

1443
02:40:42,920 --> 02:40:45,459
I guess I could.

1444
02:40:45,459 --> 02:40:47,399
Is it time to get rid of the dodo?

1445
02:40:47,399 --> 02:40:56,840
No.

1446
02:40:56,840 --> 02:40:58,260
I'm really looking for another deer

1447
02:40:58,299 --> 02:41:11,540
or another dodo.

1448
02:41:12,940 --> 02:41:17,899
The sheep or the rooster?

1449
02:41:17,899 --> 02:41:25,940
That's actually a pretty good play.

1450
02:41:25,940 --> 02:41:34,180
Now we just use, let me roll because I can do it.

1451
02:41:34,180 --> 02:41:37,340
Copy ability from pet ahead as a level one until the best.

1452
02:41:37,340 --> 02:41:43,329
So this copies whatever the person in front does.

1453
02:41:43,329 --> 02:41:46,520
Parrot could copy dodo.

1454
02:41:46,520 --> 02:41:47,840
So would that mean that the parrot

1455
02:41:47,840 --> 02:41:49,440
would give the dodo three attack?

1456
02:41:49,440 --> 02:41:53,530
Yeah.

1457
02:41:53,530 --> 02:41:55,409
Does the parrot copy the bus?

1458
02:41:55,409 --> 02:41:59,879
The parrot would, yeah, the parrot would copy the deer.

1459
02:41:59,879 --> 02:42:01,540
Parrot is trash.

1460
02:42:01,540 --> 02:42:03,590
Well, I don't know.

1461
02:42:03,590 --> 02:42:06,270
Copy the turkey.

1462
02:42:06,270 --> 02:42:08,350
Oh shit.

1463
02:42:08,350 --> 02:42:10,409
Copy the turkey so then anything they could summon

1464
02:42:10,409 --> 02:42:14,120
gets a six, six.

1465
02:42:14,120 --> 02:42:15,770
That's not bad.

1466
02:42:15,770 --> 02:42:19,520
That's kind of cool.

1467
02:42:19,520 --> 02:42:22,479
But what would I get rid of?

1468
02:42:22,479 --> 02:42:25,040
Like everyone up here is way too important right now.

1469
02:42:25,040 --> 02:42:29,770
It would be an 11, 11 bus.

1470
02:42:29,770 --> 02:42:30,690
I don't have space for it.

1471
02:42:30,690 --> 02:42:41,049
I don't.

1472
02:42:41,049 --> 02:42:43,530
Eat shop food, give two random friends one, one.

1473
02:42:51,790 --> 02:42:52,629
Good.

1474
02:42:52,629 --> 02:42:55,530
That's really good.

1475
02:42:55,530 --> 02:42:56,649
I'm not gonna give that to anybody else.

1476
02:42:56,649 --> 02:42:57,489
All right, come on.

1477
02:42:57,489 --> 02:43:03,120
Let's go.

1478
02:43:03,120 --> 02:43:05,969
How many vitamin gummies can you eat in one sitting?

1479
02:43:05,969 --> 02:43:07,450
Why would you eat that many vitamin gummies?

1480
02:43:07,450 --> 02:43:10,879
That's like bad for you.

1481
02:43:10,879 --> 02:43:13,079
This is an instant kill.

1482
02:43:13,079 --> 02:43:15,639
Thankfully, he's not gonna be able to go through it.

1483
02:43:15,639 --> 02:43:16,479
It's gonna kill.

1484
02:43:17,000 --> 02:43:20,899
Thank God.

1485
02:43:20,899 --> 02:43:23,780
This motherfucker though.

1486
02:43:23,780 --> 02:43:24,620
Die.

1487
02:43:24,620 --> 02:43:26,020
Damn it.

1488
02:43:26,020 --> 02:43:26,840
Oh yes.

1489
02:43:26,840 --> 02:43:29,790
The turkey saved it.

1490
02:43:29,790 --> 02:43:30,629
Oh shit.

1491
02:43:30,629 --> 02:43:33,120
This is gonna be rough.

1492
02:43:33,120 --> 02:43:34,879
No.

1493
02:43:34,879 --> 02:43:41,110
No, he's had so much.

1494
02:43:41,110 --> 02:43:45,709
Damn it.

1495
02:43:45,709 --> 02:43:46,530
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

1496
02:43:46,530 --> 02:43:47,370
This is where it gets weird.

1497
02:43:47,370 --> 02:43:48,209
All right.

1498
02:43:48,209 --> 02:43:50,829
Gorilla, when it gets hurt, gains a coconut shield.

1499
02:43:50,829 --> 02:43:53,139
Works one time per turn.

1500
02:43:53,139 --> 02:43:56,290
It ignores all damage once.

1501
02:43:56,290 --> 02:43:57,129
This is a snake.

1502
02:43:57,129 --> 02:44:00,680
Okay, so friend, when the person ahead of you attacks,

1503
02:44:00,680 --> 02:44:11,579
deal five damage to a random person.

1504
02:44:11,579 --> 02:44:13,200
These two seem like a no-brainer,

1505
02:44:14,579 --> 02:44:20,809
but I don't know which one's better.

1506
02:44:20,809 --> 02:44:26,049
Behind the, I feel like it would be better behind somebody

1507
02:44:26,049 --> 02:44:28,219
that can, probably the kangaroo, right?

1508
02:44:28,219 --> 02:44:29,579
Because the kangaroo is gonna be able to swing

1509
02:44:29,579 --> 02:44:38,610
the most amount of times.

1510
02:44:38,610 --> 02:44:41,040
Put the dodo on the rooster now.

1511
02:44:41,040 --> 02:44:46,360
Yeah, that's a good idea.

1512
02:44:48,700 --> 02:44:51,059
Or I could use the deer, but ah.

1513
02:44:51,059 --> 02:44:51,899
All right, hold on.

1514
02:44:51,899 --> 02:44:52,959
Let's do this.

1515
02:44:52,959 --> 02:44:57,479
If I find chocolate, then the deer is gonna stay.

1516
02:44:57,479 --> 02:45:08,559
I need to try it real once.

1517
02:45:08,559 --> 02:45:09,600
Fuck that splash damage.

1518
02:45:09,600 --> 02:45:10,940
That's good.

1519
02:45:15,959 --> 02:45:20,149
I feel like somebody should have this.

1520
02:45:20,149 --> 02:45:22,450
Food with health and attack effects

1521
02:45:22,450 --> 02:45:27,270
are doubled.

1522
02:45:27,270 --> 02:45:29,409
Splash on the kangaroo, that's probably the play,

1523
02:45:29,409 --> 02:45:36,280
but that would get rid of the garlic armor.

1524
02:45:36,280 --> 02:45:42,819
I'm gonna roll one more time.

1525
02:45:42,819 --> 02:45:45,700
Give it to the deer.

1526
02:45:45,700 --> 02:45:48,100
Yeah, because it's always five damage,

1527
02:45:48,100 --> 02:45:50,340
so it's gonna do five splash regardless.

1528
02:45:50,340 --> 02:45:52,059
Yeah, that's a good idea.

1529
02:45:52,059 --> 02:45:58,489
Let's do another roll.

1530
02:45:58,489 --> 02:45:59,969
Fly, when a friend faints,

1531
02:45:59,969 --> 02:46:07,100
summon a two-two fly in its place?

1532
02:46:07,100 --> 02:46:15,649
I feel like that would be better than the turkey.

1533
02:46:15,649 --> 02:46:21,829
No, I see the tier six and I go better.

1534
02:46:21,829 --> 02:46:24,040
Turkey and the fly.

1535
02:46:24,040 --> 02:46:34,040
So is it time to get rid of the dodo or the rooster?

1536
02:46:34,079 --> 02:46:38,950
Turkey and fly is big, big, big.

1537
02:46:38,950 --> 02:46:39,790
Dodo sucks.

1538
02:46:39,790 --> 02:46:42,270
Dodo or kangaroo, but this is the only reason

1539
02:46:42,270 --> 02:46:45,899
why it can even hurt anything right at this stage.

1540
02:46:45,899 --> 02:46:47,739
I think sell dodo, but that's a hard call.

1541
02:46:47,739 --> 02:46:51,590
Yeah, I don't know.

1542
02:46:51,590 --> 02:46:52,690
Yeah, all right.

1543
02:46:52,690 --> 02:47:02,180
We're gonna replace dodo with the fly.

1544
02:47:02,180 --> 02:47:07,329
And then, hold on.

1545
02:47:07,329 --> 02:47:10,799
I have another rooster.

1546
02:47:10,799 --> 02:47:13,569
Fly, rooster.

1547
02:47:13,569 --> 02:47:17,930
When a summon a two-two fly in its place.

1548
02:47:17,930 --> 02:47:26,479
Okay, I ruined it, how?

1549
02:47:26,479 --> 02:47:35,270
Okay, so I'm gonna do, yeah, okay.

1550
02:47:35,270 --> 02:47:37,989
But now, but there's not enough room.

1551
02:47:37,989 --> 02:47:46,270
Does the kangaroo need to go first?

1552
02:47:46,270 --> 02:47:52,020
Because this is gonna summon a bus

1553
02:47:52,020 --> 02:47:55,110
and it's not gonna be able to summon the two-two fly.

1554
02:47:55,110 --> 02:47:56,989
So I feel like this needs to be first

1555
02:47:56,989 --> 02:47:59,250
because this has to die,

1556
02:47:59,250 --> 02:48:02,979
then there's enough room for all the summons.

1557
02:48:02,979 --> 02:48:07,959
Is that wrong?

1558
02:48:07,959 --> 02:48:10,120
No?

1559
02:48:10,120 --> 02:48:14,530
Yeah, isn't that correct?

1560
02:48:14,530 --> 02:48:18,729
It's fine, you just miss one fly.

1561
02:48:18,729 --> 02:48:23,680
Turkey won't buff it.

1562
02:48:23,680 --> 02:48:27,649
Don't put kangaroo first, it will not use its ability.

1563
02:48:27,649 --> 02:48:29,250
Let's, yeah, okay, that's true.

1564
02:48:29,250 --> 02:48:35,420
Well, let's just see how this goes.

1565
02:48:35,420 --> 02:48:38,340
Maybe like this?

1566
02:48:38,340 --> 02:48:45,600
I think that's the fly.

1567
02:48:45,600 --> 02:48:50,500
All right, yeah, let's go.

1568
02:48:50,500 --> 02:48:55,610
Because I'm just imagining it won't summon all the flies.

1569
02:48:55,649 --> 02:48:57,440
Well, we lost anyways.

1570
02:48:57,440 --> 02:49:04,059
I don't think we're getting through this one.

1571
02:49:04,059 --> 02:49:11,870
Maybe, that's so good, but it's too late.

1572
02:49:11,870 --> 02:49:15,969
It's too late.

1573
02:49:15,969 --> 02:49:17,010
Is it too late?

1574
02:49:17,010 --> 02:49:21,030
Maybe, no, maybe not.

1575
02:49:21,030 --> 02:49:22,629
I think this might be, no, it's not.

1576
02:49:22,629 --> 02:49:25,760
This might be a win.

1577
02:49:25,760 --> 02:49:26,600
Is it?

1578
02:49:26,600 --> 02:49:28,879
I can't tell.

1579
02:49:28,879 --> 02:49:33,270
21, 10, this is a win.

1580
02:49:33,270 --> 02:49:41,629
Holy shit.

1581
02:49:41,629 --> 02:49:47,239
All right, well, that's really good.

1582
02:49:47,239 --> 02:49:49,299
I need to level up one of these guys,

1583
02:49:49,299 --> 02:49:54,299
especially the fly or the turkey.

1584
02:49:54,299 --> 02:49:56,100
Scorpion's so good though, it's an instant kill.

1585
02:49:56,100 --> 02:50:00,989
It kills anything one hit.

1586
02:50:00,989 --> 02:50:03,389
Do I stick with the plan and just keep this team going

1587
02:50:03,389 --> 02:50:07,260
and try to buff this team?

1588
02:50:07,260 --> 02:50:11,620
Or do I replace somebody with the instant kill Scorpion?

1589
02:50:11,620 --> 02:50:13,420
Just stick with it?

1590
02:50:13,420 --> 02:50:14,299
What about the food?

1591
02:50:14,299 --> 02:50:18,940
The canned food is usually really good, right?

1592
02:50:18,940 --> 02:50:20,139
Or are we just skipping everything

1593
02:50:20,139 --> 02:50:29,020
and just trying to buff these guys only?

1594
02:50:29,020 --> 02:50:31,420
Buff, buff, buff, just only roll for food

1595
02:50:31,420 --> 02:50:34,340
and buff this team, food.

1596
02:50:34,340 --> 02:50:35,500
Buff only the current team.

1597
02:50:35,500 --> 02:50:40,940
All right, let's go.

1598
02:50:40,940 --> 02:50:43,180
Oh, that's cheese pizza.

1599
02:50:43,180 --> 02:50:45,860
Okay, if the cheese pizza goes to,

1600
02:50:45,860 --> 02:50:52,079
oh, that's a cheese pizza.

1601
02:50:52,079 --> 02:50:56,780
Bingo, exactly who I wanted it on.

1602
02:50:56,819 --> 02:50:59,579
Give me another rooster or another deer, come on.

1603
02:50:59,579 --> 02:51:11,209
Or two turkeys, I want two turkeys.

1604
02:51:11,209 --> 02:51:13,610
Give other level two and three friends one, one.

1605
02:51:13,610 --> 02:51:16,219
I don't have any.

1606
02:51:16,219 --> 02:51:21,239
I guess I could just do this on the kangaroo.

1607
02:51:21,239 --> 02:51:25,329
Let's hold that for a second.

1608
02:51:25,329 --> 02:51:29,750
I can't sell anybody, we gotta run this to the end.

1609
02:51:29,750 --> 02:51:32,510
Back for 20 more damage once.

1610
02:51:32,510 --> 02:51:35,229
Oh, the shark, friend faints two, one.

1611
02:51:35,229 --> 02:51:37,530
That's a lot of fainting.

1612
02:51:37,530 --> 02:51:43,629
That's a lot of fainting.

1613
02:51:43,629 --> 02:51:52,229
But the stake on the deer, is the shark a trap?

1614
02:51:52,229 --> 02:51:53,430
Fly is better.

1615
02:51:53,430 --> 02:51:57,860
Yeah, the fly I think might be actually better.

1616
02:51:57,860 --> 02:51:59,760
Freeze the shark at least, okay.

1617
02:51:59,760 --> 02:52:11,440
Well, if I can't lose, if I lose it's over.

1618
02:52:11,440 --> 02:52:12,959
Put the stake on the deer,

1619
02:52:12,959 --> 02:52:16,690
because it's a guaranteed more than 20 damage.

1620
02:52:16,690 --> 02:52:18,620
I'm either gonna do that

1621
02:52:18,620 --> 02:52:22,549
or I'm gonna do the three, three on the kangaroo.

1622
02:52:22,549 --> 02:52:25,600
I can roll again, but do I,

1623
02:52:25,600 --> 02:52:29,969
I think I need to save the stake.

1624
02:52:29,969 --> 02:52:33,479
Let's roll.

1625
02:52:33,479 --> 02:52:37,520
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.

1626
02:52:37,520 --> 02:52:40,459
Why can this not be like a turn ago?

1627
02:52:40,459 --> 02:52:45,819
Oh my God, this would be insane.

1628
02:52:45,819 --> 02:52:51,250
Because that means he would be doing four, four.

1629
02:52:51,250 --> 02:52:53,030
Stake on the deer, freeze everybody,

1630
02:52:53,850 --> 02:52:54,690
because the cow is crazy too,

1631
02:52:54,690 --> 02:53:03,549
but I can't replace anybody.

1632
02:53:03,549 --> 02:53:06,489
All right, we'll go and stake in the front.

1633
02:53:06,489 --> 02:53:09,219
This is, I have to play for the win, right?

1634
02:53:09,219 --> 02:53:10,860
He'll kill the first thing.

1635
02:53:10,860 --> 02:53:15,979
Next round we get a level, okay, here we go.

1636
02:53:15,979 --> 02:53:18,100
I should freeze the cow, because then I could sell,

1637
02:53:18,100 --> 02:53:24,219
mm, shark better than kangaroo.

1638
02:53:24,219 --> 02:53:25,879
I don't know, not at this stage.

1639
02:53:25,879 --> 02:53:31,340
Especially if I can get him to like a 30, 30.

1640
02:53:31,340 --> 02:53:33,260
Yeah, no, no, I'm sticking with the plan.

1641
02:53:33,260 --> 02:53:34,940
If we live, we live.

1642
02:53:34,940 --> 02:53:42,299
I'm going, let's go.

1643
02:53:42,299 --> 02:53:45,840
Because there's nobody I can really replace.

1644
02:53:45,840 --> 02:53:49,200
The dog is terrifying, but I think, oh, yeah.

1645
02:53:50,040 --> 02:53:52,340
Oh man, okay, hold on.

1646
02:53:52,340 --> 02:53:55,700
All right, what we got?

1647
02:53:55,700 --> 02:53:58,540
That dog is terrifying, but I should be all right.

1648
02:53:58,540 --> 02:54:03,340
I think I'm going to be okay.

1649
02:54:03,340 --> 02:54:12,780
21, two, 18.

1650
02:54:12,780 --> 02:54:15,479
All right, come on, come on.

1651
02:54:15,479 --> 02:54:21,299
No, damn it, no.

1652
02:54:21,299 --> 02:54:24,500
He was just too strong.

1653
02:54:24,500 --> 02:54:27,729
He's just had too much attack and too much health.

1654
02:54:27,729 --> 02:54:33,659
Not well, double monkey.

1655
02:54:33,659 --> 02:54:38,079
I'm not sure I was going to get over that one.

1656
02:54:38,079 --> 02:54:40,440
Damn it, it's that kangaroo pole

1657
02:54:40,440 --> 02:54:48,010
couldn't happen last turn.

1658
02:54:48,049 --> 02:54:54,690
Oh well, that's fun, this game's fun.

1659
02:54:54,690 --> 02:55:01,190
All right, we're going beaver, cricket.

1660
02:55:01,190 --> 02:55:05,530
I mean, the horse sucks, but I can just sell him.

1661
02:55:05,530 --> 02:55:10,629
I should just roll.

1662
02:55:10,629 --> 02:55:16,000
Cricket sucks too, the horse is worse.

1663
02:55:16,000 --> 02:55:31,500
Just to go for the stats, mosquito.

1664
02:55:31,500 --> 02:55:34,059
Try to get ant, yeah.

1665
02:55:34,059 --> 02:55:43,379
I think ant's the best tier one person.

1666
02:55:43,379 --> 02:55:46,329
This is just a trade, so it's, oh no, it's not.

1667
02:55:46,329 --> 02:55:47,409
Oh no, this is a loss.

1668
02:55:52,600 --> 02:55:53,879
Remember the timer, it's been two hours

1669
02:55:53,879 --> 02:55:56,420
since you said 30 minutes.

1670
02:55:56,420 --> 02:55:57,500
Yeah, but what else am I doing right now?

1671
02:55:57,500 --> 02:56:03,540
I'm fine.

1672
02:56:03,540 --> 02:56:15,170
Fuck it, has more stats right now,

1673
02:56:15,170 --> 02:56:18,040
but it summons the one, one rap of the other team.

1674
02:56:18,719 --> 02:56:25,370
You know, yeah, let's just go for it.

1675
02:56:25,370 --> 02:56:32,889
Cricket first, oh no, he should probably be first.

1676
02:56:32,889 --> 02:56:34,989
Didn't you say this is going to be like 30 more minutes?

1677
02:56:34,989 --> 02:56:48,770
Yeah, I'm having fun though, but the rat last.

1678
02:56:48,770 --> 02:56:56,190
Nice, why last?

1679
02:56:56,190 --> 02:56:58,430
I don't know, because he has the most health,

1680
02:56:58,430 --> 02:57:03,559
but I kind of want him to tank.

1681
02:57:03,559 --> 02:57:09,780
Turns out it didn't matter.

1682
02:57:09,780 --> 02:57:13,059
Well, that cricket upgrade seemed like now a good idea,

1683
02:57:13,059 --> 02:57:15,809
although this is going to be tricky.

1684
02:57:15,809 --> 02:57:21,579
No, this is a loss.

1685
02:57:21,579 --> 02:57:22,620
Do I have to give this homework?

1686
02:57:22,620 --> 02:57:24,260
Don't remind him, oh, they're reminding me

1687
02:57:24,260 --> 02:57:27,739
to turn the stream off.

1688
02:57:27,739 --> 02:57:30,059
Well, I'll be back on Sunday.

1689
02:57:30,059 --> 02:57:31,059
This is just going to be a little thing

1690
02:57:31,059 --> 02:57:33,799
just to kind of jump in and play around with them.

1691
02:57:33,799 --> 02:57:47,219
The tournament, that looks good.

1692
02:57:47,219 --> 02:57:48,659
That looks good too.

1693
02:57:48,659 --> 02:57:49,979
I like the swan.

1694
02:57:49,979 --> 02:57:52,979
I like the spider as well.

1695
02:57:52,979 --> 02:57:54,979
Do a bug tier list.

1696
02:57:54,979 --> 02:57:59,940
Every single bug at F, honey bees at S,

1697
02:57:59,940 --> 02:58:07,700
praying mantis at S, a big stag beetle at A,

1698
02:58:15,579 --> 02:58:25,299
and that's it.

1699
02:58:25,299 --> 02:58:27,420
What about butterfly?

1700
02:58:27,420 --> 02:58:29,979
Ah, B, A, not A.

1701
02:58:29,979 --> 02:58:30,819
What about a worm?

1702
02:58:30,819 --> 02:58:40,909
A worm's not a bug.

1703
02:58:40,909 --> 02:58:47,139
A worm is a bug?

1704
02:58:47,139 --> 02:58:50,780
Worm is, no, that doesn't classify as an insecto,

1705
02:58:50,780 --> 02:58:53,059
whatever they're called.

1706
02:58:53,100 --> 02:58:54,059
A worm is a bug?

1707
02:58:54,059 --> 02:58:59,059
I thought a worm was something else.

1708
02:58:59,059 --> 02:59:00,059
It's not an insect.

1709
02:59:00,059 --> 02:59:04,940
Yeah, I thought that's not an insect.

1710
02:59:04,940 --> 02:59:10,170
Is it, okay, worm, bug?

1711
02:59:10,170 --> 02:59:13,680
Isn't it like a nematode or something?

1712
02:59:13,680 --> 02:59:14,799
No, worms are not insects.

1713
02:59:14,799 --> 02:59:16,319
Both worms and insects are classified

1714
02:59:16,319 --> 02:59:19,979
under the kingdom animalia?

1715
02:59:19,979 --> 02:59:22,379
Vertebrae, animals with a backbone,

1716
02:59:22,379 --> 02:59:24,219
and invertebrae, animals without a backbone.

1717
02:59:24,219 --> 02:59:26,059
Are worms insects or animals?

1718
02:59:26,059 --> 02:59:33,209
Are worms considered a bug?

1719
02:59:33,209 --> 02:59:40,299
What is an, no, it's not a bug.

1720
02:59:40,299 --> 02:59:49,579
It's like an invertebrate worm thing.

1721
02:59:49,579 --> 02:59:59,770
They're like nematodes or something.

1722
03:00:00,010 --> 03:00:04,260
Okay, although they are indeed invertebrate insects,

1723
03:00:04,260 --> 03:00:06,299
worms definitely are not insects.

1724
03:00:06,299 --> 03:00:10,579
Even segmented worms are not classified as an insect.

1725
03:00:10,579 --> 03:00:16,760
They're just called an invertebrate worm.

1726
03:00:16,760 --> 03:00:21,260
Okay, well, there's a post on MMO Champion

1727
03:00:21,260 --> 03:00:22,979
from like 10 years ago.

1728
03:00:22,979 --> 03:00:24,540
Somebody please settle a debate with me.

1729
03:00:24,540 --> 03:00:28,750
Are worms bugs?

1730
03:00:28,750 --> 03:00:35,219
It looks like this has been a battle for a century.

1731
03:00:35,219 --> 03:00:38,159
I disagree, I don't think that worms are bugs.

1732
03:00:38,159 --> 03:00:41,059
They're like an inanimate, not inanimate object.

1733
03:00:41,059 --> 03:00:42,979
They're an invertebrate object.

1734
03:00:42,979 --> 03:00:43,819
Whoa.

1735
03:00:45,600 --> 03:00:54,909
Okay, I'm gonna sell the beaver.

1736
03:00:54,909 --> 03:00:56,870
They didn't want it to go on either one of these two.

1737
03:00:56,870 --> 03:01:11,159
Not really, but you know, we kinda have to do this now.

1738
03:01:17,469 --> 03:01:23,239
All right, what does a level two rat do?

1739
03:01:23,239 --> 03:01:32,579
Does it just get rid of the dirty one, one rat?

1740
03:01:32,579 --> 03:01:33,840
I don't think I really want the spider.

1741
03:01:33,840 --> 03:01:35,680
Let's just get something else.

1742
03:01:35,680 --> 03:01:37,829
Oh boy, oh boy.

1743
03:01:37,829 --> 03:01:48,760
Well, okay, I'm gonna kill that next turn.

1744
03:01:48,760 --> 03:01:59,549
Forget about the dog.

1745
03:01:59,549 --> 03:02:04,020
Why isn't the rat last?

1746
03:02:04,020 --> 03:02:06,399
So it summons a one, one for your opponent

1747
03:02:06,399 --> 03:02:07,600
that betrays them.

1748
03:02:07,600 --> 03:02:12,020
What does that even mean?

1749
03:02:12,020 --> 03:02:13,079
Friend to head deal.

1750
03:02:13,079 --> 03:02:19,600
So you deal one damage to the friend to head?

1751
03:02:19,600 --> 03:02:26,370
What?

1752
03:02:26,370 --> 03:02:40,280
What the fuck?

1753
03:02:40,280 --> 03:02:46,280
Well, let's do this.

1754
03:02:46,280 --> 03:02:49,239
Okay, all right.

1755
03:02:49,239 --> 03:02:58,059
It's time to get rid of the ant and the mosquito.

1756
03:02:58,059 --> 03:03:01,579
Or should I roll for a level two ant?

1757
03:03:01,579 --> 03:03:05,059
Let's get rid of the mosquito.

1758
03:03:05,059 --> 03:03:10,489
Put up the penguin.

1759
03:03:10,489 --> 03:03:12,559
Wait, let me get this in the right order.

1760
03:03:12,559 --> 03:03:17,120
Put up the penguin, sell the ant.

1761
03:03:17,120 --> 03:03:21,510
Sell the ant now probably,

1762
03:03:21,510 --> 03:03:28,440
because I don't really want it to go on the penguin, do I?

1763
03:03:28,479 --> 03:03:30,200
I'd rather it go on somebody else.

1764
03:03:30,200 --> 03:03:32,819
Okay, that's fine.

1765
03:03:32,819 --> 03:03:36,799
Get you up there, upgrade the rat.

1766
03:03:36,799 --> 03:03:37,840
No, not yet, hold on.

1767
03:03:37,840 --> 03:03:45,850
Let's do another roll.

1768
03:03:50,020 --> 03:03:51,260
I just do two rats.

1769
03:03:51,260 --> 03:03:54,680
Don't upgrade, just have two rats.

1770
03:03:54,680 --> 03:03:59,670
It's gonna, I think, screw me over later.

1771
03:03:59,670 --> 03:04:03,250
I can roll one more time.

1772
03:04:03,250 --> 03:04:04,780
Get the sheep.

1773
03:04:27,760 --> 03:04:39,360
I think I'm just gonna do the rat.

1774
03:04:40,850 --> 03:04:45,649
He's gonna give one, one to everybody here.

1775
03:04:45,649 --> 03:04:47,149
Worm is a worm.

1776
03:04:47,149 --> 03:04:51,040
All right, this is kind of a shitty team, but whatever.

1777
03:04:51,040 --> 03:04:56,729
The rat is the worst unit in the game.

1778
03:04:57,569 --> 03:05:01,659
Well, sorry.

1779
03:05:01,659 --> 03:05:02,979
You want me to read that so bad.

1780
03:05:02,979 --> 03:05:06,979
I've seen you write that twice, at least.

1781
03:05:06,979 --> 03:05:08,739
You want me to say that so bad.

1782
03:05:08,739 --> 03:05:11,959
I've seen you write that more than two times.

1783
03:05:11,959 --> 03:05:15,809
I'm not gonna read it.

1784
03:05:15,809 --> 03:05:17,209
You wrote it 10 times.

1785
03:05:17,209 --> 03:05:19,299
Okay, well, whatever.

1786
03:05:19,299 --> 03:05:24,479
Let's go.

1787
03:05:24,479 --> 03:05:28,930
I feel like this is not that bad.

1788
03:05:28,930 --> 03:05:30,409
I should be able to get through the first two

1789
03:05:30,409 --> 03:05:34,639
with the cricket.

1790
03:05:34,639 --> 03:05:36,120
Yeah, the first three with the cricket, actually.

1791
03:05:36,120 --> 03:05:39,440
This is good, because the cricket's a two-two,

1792
03:05:39,440 --> 03:05:45,690
because he's, oh, nevermind.

1793
03:05:45,690 --> 03:05:58,110
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.

1794
03:05:58,110 --> 03:05:59,870
No, they're gonna win.

1795
03:05:59,870 --> 03:06:10,190
The rat's the worst unit in the game.

1796
03:06:10,190 --> 03:06:12,909
But I'm kind of stuck with the rat.

1797
03:06:41,370 --> 03:06:47,700
Look at his roll.

1798
03:06:47,700 --> 03:06:50,639
It's good, but not really.

1799
03:06:50,639 --> 03:06:52,159
Rab, copy the health.

1800
03:06:58,389 --> 03:07:00,030
Whale, rat, why would I do that?

1801
03:07:00,030 --> 03:07:19,719
Oh, I mean, I could do rabbit salad bowl.

1802
03:07:19,719 --> 03:07:25,200
Kill the rat, the whale behind the rat.

1803
03:07:25,200 --> 03:07:28,579
Why would I do that?

1804
03:07:28,579 --> 03:07:33,530
Ox and otter.

1805
03:07:33,530 --> 03:07:40,920
I'm going rabbit salad,

1806
03:07:40,920 --> 03:07:41,959
just in case I get something good.

1807
03:07:41,959 --> 03:07:52,700
Hold on, not really.

1808
03:07:52,700 --> 03:08:05,450
Actually really good that it hit those two.

1809
03:08:05,489 --> 03:08:10,200
I'll hold on to the dodo, maybe.

1810
03:08:10,200 --> 03:08:13,889
No, actually, it's probably too late for the dodo.

1811
03:08:13,889 --> 03:08:24,989
Yeah, let's just go.

1812
03:08:24,989 --> 03:08:27,069
Hailing the rat would just give me a one-one.

1813
03:08:27,069 --> 03:08:32,860
I don't know how that even works.

1814
03:08:32,860 --> 03:08:38,379
That's a wash, but he comes back.

1815
03:08:39,700 --> 03:08:44,930
This is gonna be tough.

1816
03:08:44,930 --> 03:08:47,000
Yeah, I'm in trouble.

1817
03:08:47,000 --> 03:09:00,030
I just didn't scale that well.

1818
03:09:00,030 --> 03:09:05,270
That's not bad.

1819
03:09:05,270 --> 03:09:07,110
That's actually really pretty good.

1820
03:09:07,110 --> 03:09:17,389
Deal five damage to the lowest enemy with the lowest health.

1821
03:09:17,389 --> 03:09:25,610
I think it's dolphin in the back, or even in the front.

1822
03:09:25,610 --> 03:09:26,649
Wait, snail first.

1823
03:09:26,649 --> 03:09:29,850
Wait, I think I want the dolphin

1824
03:09:29,850 --> 03:09:33,040
to get the buff from the snail.

1825
03:09:33,040 --> 03:09:34,489
Can I get rid of the rabbit?

1826
03:09:34,489 --> 03:09:35,690
Oh, what happened?

1827
03:09:35,690 --> 03:09:36,530
No!

1828
03:09:40,219 --> 03:09:41,059
I was trying.

1829
03:09:46,000 --> 03:09:55,399
I apparently had this selected, and I clicked what?

1830
03:09:55,399 --> 03:09:56,440
Oh, fuck.

1831
03:09:56,440 --> 03:10:00,209
Okay, well, whatever, goodbye.

1832
03:10:00,209 --> 03:10:28,760
That kinda sucks.

1833
03:10:28,760 --> 03:10:36,360
Put him first, because he only does that once.

1834
03:10:36,360 --> 03:10:37,600
Elephant would be good if I don't have anybody

1835
03:10:37,600 --> 03:10:45,500
that can benefit.

1836
03:10:45,500 --> 03:10:51,940
Yeah, we'll put him first, or rat first.

1837
03:10:51,940 --> 03:10:59,790
This game free, this game is free.

1838
03:10:59,790 --> 03:11:04,870
I believe this is $5 to buy the extra animals.

1839
03:11:04,870 --> 03:11:07,979
So, I believe this is free.

1840
03:11:07,979 --> 03:11:14,430
That rat sucks, but I think I win this.

1841
03:11:14,430 --> 03:11:16,030
It's not that good, actually.

1842
03:11:16,030 --> 03:11:18,299
That kind of is really bad.

1843
03:11:18,299 --> 03:11:20,829
That's not good.

1844
03:11:20,829 --> 03:11:26,430
I just gave him free buffs to everybody.

1845
03:11:26,430 --> 03:11:37,270
I think I still might win this, though.

1846
03:11:37,270 --> 03:11:45,329
Only one win, oh my God.

1847
03:11:47,399 --> 03:11:50,639
I know, I gotta get rid of the bunny.

1848
03:11:50,639 --> 03:11:51,600
Maybe the penguin, too.

1849
03:11:51,600 --> 03:12:02,200
Penguin's not doing anything right now.

1850
03:12:02,200 --> 03:12:07,729
Crab behind rat is not bad.

1851
03:12:07,729 --> 03:12:10,729
Then just feed the crab.

1852
03:12:10,729 --> 03:12:18,520
Hippo is amazing as well.

1853
03:12:18,520 --> 03:12:20,319
Think it's time to get rid of the penguin,

1854
03:12:20,319 --> 03:12:26,520
because the rabbit, I can feed the hippo,

1855
03:12:26,559 --> 03:12:32,319
and he'll get extra health from that.

1856
03:12:32,319 --> 03:12:44,219
I think that's what I'm doing.

1857
03:12:44,219 --> 03:12:49,420
Very good, roll again.

1858
03:12:49,420 --> 03:12:51,260
Really wanted something else besides this.

1859
03:12:51,260 --> 03:12:55,559
These two, it could have been anything else.

1860
03:12:55,559 --> 03:12:59,579
It could have been anything else but these two.

1861
03:12:59,579 --> 03:13:01,459
But, I mean, I have to use it,

1862
03:13:01,459 --> 03:13:18,260
because he's gonna get the health.

1863
03:13:18,260 --> 03:13:19,579
I feel like I should put him behind,

1864
03:13:19,579 --> 03:13:20,739
still put him behind.

1865
03:13:20,739 --> 03:13:25,030
I don't think he has enough damage to kill anything.

1866
03:13:25,030 --> 03:13:30,200
Well, I'm dead anyways, so let's go.

1867
03:13:30,200 --> 03:13:34,750
This is a dead rat run.

1868
03:13:34,750 --> 03:13:41,000
Oh, hold on, hold on.

1869
03:13:41,000 --> 03:13:44,299
Ooh, that's good.

1870
03:13:44,299 --> 03:13:47,149
What'd he just kill?

1871
03:13:47,149 --> 03:13:52,979
This is okay.

1872
03:13:53,020 --> 03:13:54,879
I think this is all right.

1873
03:13:54,879 --> 03:13:56,399
It is.

1874
03:13:56,399 --> 03:13:58,700
We live another day.

1875
03:13:58,700 --> 03:14:02,229
The bunny, yeah.

1876
03:14:02,229 --> 03:14:16,920
14 damage, holy shit.

1877
03:14:16,920 --> 03:14:24,889
Splash damage on, these are all good,

1878
03:14:24,889 --> 03:14:26,649
but it's almost like I can't even do it.

1879
03:14:26,649 --> 03:14:29,500
It's too late.

1880
03:14:29,500 --> 03:14:31,860
The shark with all the bees, yeah.

1881
03:14:31,860 --> 03:14:34,440
It's, okay, I gotta get rid of the rabbit,

1882
03:14:34,440 --> 03:14:35,399
and we're gonna do shark,

1883
03:14:35,399 --> 03:14:42,829
and we're gonna do bee on everybody.

1884
03:14:42,829 --> 03:14:54,729
Yeah, I'm gonna put bee on the dolphin.

1885
03:14:54,729 --> 03:15:02,780
Bee on dolphin or bee on, okay.

1886
03:15:02,780 --> 03:15:08,030
Splash damage for, oh, let's roll.

1887
03:15:08,030 --> 03:15:14,700
This emote is vile, I don't even know what I'm looking at.

1888
03:15:14,739 --> 03:15:19,850
Couldn't give me anything that could work with me here.

1889
03:15:19,850 --> 03:15:29,559
I could just do, roll again.

1890
03:15:29,559 --> 03:15:34,500
Heal seven damage to the last enemy?

1891
03:15:34,500 --> 03:15:37,500
I could just be the cricket.

1892
03:15:37,500 --> 03:15:43,129
Yeah, this is really like kind of a last ditch ever here.

1893
03:15:43,129 --> 03:15:48,760
Let's just try to, let's just smoke this guy up.

1894
03:15:48,760 --> 03:15:50,379
That's the best thing I got.

1895
03:15:50,379 --> 03:15:52,889
Let's hope I don't lose.

1896
03:15:52,889 --> 03:15:54,959
Are you streaming on a Tuesday?

1897
03:15:54,959 --> 03:15:57,049
I wasn't planning on streaming,

1898
03:15:57,049 --> 03:15:59,719
but I was like, you know what, let's go,

1899
03:15:59,719 --> 03:16:03,809
because I was playing in the Ludwig's Auto Pets Tournament,

1900
03:16:03,809 --> 03:16:05,690
which I did okay.

1901
03:16:05,690 --> 03:16:06,530
I did all right.

1902
03:16:06,530 --> 03:16:07,770
I came in last place.

1903
03:16:07,889 --> 03:16:10,159
I lost every game I played in a row,

1904
03:16:10,159 --> 03:16:13,569
and I forgot the rules the first three matches,

1905
03:16:13,569 --> 03:16:14,610
but it was not, it wasn't bad.

1906
03:16:14,610 --> 03:16:18,059
It was okay.

1907
03:16:18,059 --> 03:16:19,459
I think this actually might work out.

1908
03:16:19,459 --> 03:16:22,219
The shark's gonna get just so fed.

1909
03:16:22,219 --> 03:16:26,770
It really depends on what happens here.

1910
03:16:26,770 --> 03:16:29,799
I think this is a win.

1911
03:16:29,799 --> 03:16:34,639
Yeah, he's gonna be too fed.

1912
03:16:34,639 --> 03:16:41,040
Bee shark strategy seems to be pretty good,

1913
03:16:41,040 --> 03:16:41,879
because here we go.

1914
03:16:41,879 --> 03:16:44,920
All right, he's got 11.

1915
03:16:44,920 --> 03:16:47,600
He'll have, how much will he have?

1916
03:16:47,600 --> 03:16:50,399
13, oh, fuck no.

1917
03:16:50,399 --> 03:16:53,149
Nevermind, it's over.

1918
03:16:53,149 --> 03:17:00,719
Oh well, that was never great.

1919
03:17:00,719 --> 03:17:02,600
All right, I have to pee again.

1920
03:17:02,600 --> 03:17:04,290
What's wrong with me?

1921
03:17:04,969 --> 03:17:05,809
Is he not in the tournament anymore?

1922
03:17:05,809 --> 03:17:07,659
No, I lost.

1923
03:17:07,659 --> 03:17:08,500
I'll play another one.

1924
03:17:08,500 --> 03:17:09,540
I'll play one more, maybe.

1925
03:17:09,540 --> 03:17:10,680
We'll do one more.

1926
03:17:10,680 --> 03:17:11,600
But I have to pee again,

1927
03:17:11,600 --> 03:17:12,440
because I don't know, my body,

1928
03:17:12,440 --> 03:17:14,610
I don't know what's wrong with me.

1929
03:17:14,610 --> 03:20:21,010
I'll be right back.

1930
03:20:21,010 --> 03:20:30,850
One more.

1931
03:20:30,850 --> 03:20:32,809
Oh, it's Jebaited, but it's a turkey.

1932
03:20:32,809 --> 03:20:38,059
Okay, I get it.

1933
03:20:38,059 --> 03:20:42,239
I was trying, I thought it was a flying skull.

1934
03:20:42,239 --> 03:20:44,450
Flames behind it.

1935
03:20:44,450 --> 03:20:50,780
He was going really fast, I don't know.

1936
03:20:50,780 --> 03:21:03,860
Hey, let's go back, okay.

1937
03:21:03,860 --> 03:21:06,219
Very nice.

1938
03:21:06,219 --> 03:21:10,409
It's just time to continue.

1939
03:21:10,409 --> 03:21:11,489
All right, last one.

1940
03:21:11,489 --> 03:21:19,129
All right off the bat, this is a great one.

1941
03:21:19,129 --> 03:21:22,129
Already, right off the bat.

1942
03:21:22,129 --> 03:21:25,709
Beautiful.

1943
03:21:25,709 --> 03:21:30,680
Oh, yuck.

1944
03:21:31,440 --> 03:21:37,120
Oh, it's, ah, I didn't want to do that.

1945
03:21:39,469 --> 03:21:41,309
I wanted to move him.

1946
03:21:41,309 --> 03:21:43,549
Fuck, come on.

1947
03:21:43,549 --> 03:21:46,399
Okay, it's, oh, listen to me.

1948
03:21:46,399 --> 03:21:49,899
It's right, you hold right click to move.

1949
03:21:49,899 --> 03:21:51,180
You don't hold left click to move.

1950
03:21:51,180 --> 03:21:57,020
Don't make the mistake I keep making.

1951
03:21:57,020 --> 03:22:15,569
Shit, it's right click.

1952
03:22:15,569 --> 03:22:19,079
It's okay, I think this is still a win.

1953
03:22:19,079 --> 03:22:19,920
Or it's a draw?

1954
03:22:19,920 --> 03:22:29,549
No, it's a win.

1955
03:22:29,549 --> 03:22:30,489
Because my brain just wants to move,

1956
03:22:30,489 --> 03:22:31,649
like move you this way, move you that way,

1957
03:22:31,649 --> 03:22:33,170
but I got to burn that in my brain.

1958
03:22:33,170 --> 03:22:37,280
It's right click, right click, right click.

1959
03:22:38,120 --> 03:22:42,930
I like the fish on low levels.

1960
03:22:42,930 --> 03:22:57,079
Ooh, okay, nice.

1961
03:22:57,079 --> 03:23:00,549
I like it, looks good.

1962
03:23:00,549 --> 03:23:01,389
You have to pee?

1963
03:23:01,389 --> 03:23:14,690
We just went pee.

1964
03:23:14,690 --> 03:23:17,159
Go to the fish behind you, nice, perfect.

1965
03:23:17,159 --> 03:23:27,530
I'll just clean the rest of this up.

1966
03:23:27,530 --> 03:23:29,639
I have mine, why are you saying we?

1967
03:23:29,639 --> 03:23:31,680
Well, we as in collectively,

1968
03:23:31,680 --> 03:23:36,389
we all went to the bathroom five minutes ago.

1969
03:23:36,389 --> 03:23:37,750
Oh, beautiful.

1970
03:23:37,750 --> 03:23:39,510
It's like the game wants me to win.

1971
03:23:39,510 --> 03:23:47,360
It actually really wants me to win.

1972
03:23:47,360 --> 03:23:56,520
I mean, it's just good for now.

1973
03:23:56,520 --> 03:23:58,280
How come, does it just say giraffe?

1974
03:23:58,280 --> 03:23:59,479
How come it doesn't say that for anybody else?

1975
03:23:59,479 --> 03:24:02,700
That's the only person that says that.

1976
03:24:02,739 --> 03:24:03,739
Did I bring that up earlier?

1977
03:24:03,739 --> 03:24:14,100
That's weird.

1978
03:24:14,100 --> 03:24:22,239
Nice, nice, oh, nice.

1979
03:24:22,239 --> 03:24:25,379
All right, I think I'm gonna hold that sheep.

1980
03:24:25,379 --> 03:24:27,569
I'm gonna hold the meat.

1981
03:24:27,569 --> 03:24:29,250
I'm gonna give this to you

1982
03:24:29,250 --> 03:24:32,819
because I want you to have more health.

1983
03:24:32,819 --> 03:24:34,930
Yeah, well, they don't make noise.

1984
03:24:34,930 --> 03:24:46,100
Oh, okay, that's cute.

1985
03:24:46,100 --> 03:24:47,790
Hold the sheep, hold the meat.

1986
03:24:47,790 --> 03:24:48,909
I think so.

1987
03:24:48,909 --> 03:25:00,549
I get another fish, then the whole thing changes.

1988
03:25:00,549 --> 03:25:02,350
Whoa, he did way more than I thought he was gonna do.

1989
03:25:02,350 --> 03:25:05,639
What was up with that?

1990
03:25:05,639 --> 03:25:10,270
He just did so much damage.

1991
03:25:10,270 --> 03:25:12,530
Oh, why did he do that much damage?

1992
03:25:12,530 --> 03:25:16,760
Oh, because he has meat on, shit, okay.

1993
03:25:16,920 --> 03:25:23,969
Well, first loss, that's the plan.

1994
03:25:23,969 --> 03:25:31,770
Go in, all right, I'm combining fish

1995
03:25:31,770 --> 03:25:39,239
and I'm going to go with sheep and dog.

1996
03:25:39,239 --> 03:25:54,819
Or do I go sheep, tell the otter, that dog now,

1997
03:25:54,819 --> 03:25:58,139
then sheep instead of,

1998
03:25:58,139 --> 03:26:02,500
I feel like the otter, this two, two is so good though.

1999
03:26:02,500 --> 03:26:19,729
Maybe the giraffe, maybe, only when you buy otters.

2000
03:26:19,729 --> 03:26:22,270
That's true, but giving somebody a two, two permanently

2001
03:26:22,270 --> 03:26:28,559
right now is a pretty big deal.

2002
03:26:28,559 --> 03:26:32,780
Well, let's put the meat bone on the dog

2003
03:26:32,780 --> 03:26:51,209
or meat bone on the fish or ant.

2004
03:26:51,209 --> 03:26:55,840
I like that, cause that's 10 damage right up front.

2005
03:26:55,840 --> 03:26:57,840
Let's roll, I got some more rolls to do it.

2006
03:26:57,840 --> 03:26:59,120
Let's see exactly what I'm talking about.

2007
03:26:59,120 --> 03:27:01,659
That's why I held onto him.

2008
03:27:01,659 --> 03:27:08,559
Cause this is, I mean, that's, I can't do it twice.

2009
03:27:08,559 --> 03:27:13,620
I can put the sheep out there and I'm gonna freeze the otter.

2010
03:27:13,620 --> 03:27:29,040
We'll put out the sheep and we'll roll.

2011
03:27:29,040 --> 03:27:35,739
All right, whatever, let's go.

2012
03:27:35,739 --> 03:27:42,360
Correct order, dog champ, please say dog

2013
03:27:42,360 --> 03:27:47,969
with a Boston accent, dog, dog, dog.

2014
03:27:47,969 --> 03:27:53,399
I don't know what you mean.

2015
03:27:53,399 --> 03:27:55,239
Now we're gonna play the otter

2016
03:27:55,239 --> 03:27:56,680
and then we can just probably sell the otter

2017
03:27:56,680 --> 03:27:58,120
after that maybe, it depends.

2018
03:27:58,120 --> 03:28:03,760
If I get another otter, that's a big deal.

2019
03:28:03,760 --> 03:28:06,719
That's annoying.

2020
03:28:06,719 --> 03:28:19,459
Say with a British accent, dog.

2021
03:28:19,459 --> 03:28:23,120
I needed fish too, fish would be a big deal as well.

2022
03:28:23,120 --> 03:28:26,690
All right, let's roll.

2023
03:28:26,690 --> 03:28:27,850
I like the dog probably.

2024
03:28:27,850 --> 03:28:28,850
I don't want the bone anymore.

2025
03:28:28,850 --> 03:28:37,049
Maybe get the bone to the fish.

2026
03:28:37,049 --> 03:28:43,200
I want fish, fish or dog again.

2027
03:28:46,030 --> 03:28:49,340
I'll take the sheep maybe.

2028
03:28:49,340 --> 03:28:55,440
Yeah, do this now, fuck.

2029
03:28:55,440 --> 03:29:13,559
Okay, say with a shpee accent, dog, dog.

2030
03:29:14,280 --> 03:29:15,959
If I can last a little bit longer,

2031
03:29:15,959 --> 03:29:23,120
I can level up a bunch of stuff.

2032
03:29:23,120 --> 03:29:27,920
Now let's go.

2033
03:29:27,920 --> 03:29:30,110
You have to have summons for the dog.

2034
03:29:30,110 --> 03:29:33,010
Yeah, but that fish gives one, one to everybody.

2035
03:29:33,010 --> 03:29:34,690
I really wanna, and he's nine, 10.

2036
03:29:34,690 --> 03:29:35,530
That's like the only thing

2037
03:29:35,530 --> 03:29:38,260
that's hurting anything right now.

2038
03:29:38,260 --> 03:29:42,229
Oh, come on now, really?

2039
03:29:42,229 --> 03:29:53,479
That actually just happened.

2040
03:29:53,479 --> 03:29:56,280
I'm gonna be close, but I've still got it.

2041
03:29:56,280 --> 03:29:57,280
Do I though?

2042
03:29:57,280 --> 03:29:59,309
I don't.

2043
03:29:59,309 --> 03:30:00,229
Shit, no, I do.

2044
03:30:00,229 --> 03:30:05,450
All right, I was gonna be really upset about that one.

2045
03:30:05,450 --> 03:30:09,260
No, no, accents.

2046
03:30:09,260 --> 03:30:13,000
I'm not doing any more accents.

2047
03:30:13,000 --> 03:30:18,200
I could pill ant,

2048
03:30:18,200 --> 03:30:20,540
and then I need some more summon stuff.

2049
03:30:20,540 --> 03:30:25,530
Cricket is a summon, but meh.

2050
03:30:25,530 --> 03:30:29,879
All right, all right, all right.

2051
03:30:29,879 --> 03:30:34,340
Now we're talking a little bit here.

2052
03:30:34,340 --> 03:30:40,149
Okay, okay, if I get a level two dog,

2053
03:30:40,149 --> 03:30:45,229
then this thing's gonna get fed and it's gonna be amazing.

2054
03:30:45,229 --> 03:30:57,309
I know I'm gonna do that, so just do it.

2055
03:30:57,309 --> 03:31:02,420
Do I just do this now?

2056
03:31:02,420 --> 03:31:17,129
Roll for another dog.

2057
03:31:17,129 --> 03:31:21,430
Yes, bingo, bingo.

2058
03:31:21,430 --> 03:31:25,040
Absolute bingo right here.

2059
03:31:25,040 --> 03:31:28,430
Hell yeah, all right.

2060
03:31:28,430 --> 03:31:34,139
Now, this is good too.

2061
03:31:34,139 --> 03:31:38,319
I'm gonna hold onto this.

2062
03:31:38,319 --> 03:31:41,940
Next round, we're gonna make a bunch of moves.

2063
03:31:41,940 --> 03:31:45,260
Okay, next round is a bunch of moves.

2064
03:31:45,260 --> 03:31:47,659
Dog is gonna get two two for every single person

2065
03:31:47,659 --> 03:31:51,069
that is summoned, which should be all right.

2066
03:31:51,069 --> 03:31:52,959
That should probably take us through

2067
03:31:52,959 --> 03:31:55,360
at least the next round or two.

2068
03:31:55,360 --> 03:31:58,409
Say that what you just said in a Brooklyn accent.

2069
03:31:58,409 --> 03:32:02,659
So I got the dog, I got a dog at level two,

2070
03:32:02,659 --> 03:32:07,389
and when the penguin comes up here,

2071
03:32:07,389 --> 03:32:08,430
I'll be drinking my coffee

2072
03:32:08,430 --> 03:32:10,610
and the penguin will fucking just annihilate everybody.

2073
03:32:10,610 --> 03:32:12,129
That's in a row, you know what I mean?

2074
03:32:12,129 --> 03:32:15,340
They can take people out in a row, it's pretty good.

2075
03:32:15,340 --> 03:32:20,450
I've only had two coffees, so I don't know.

2076
03:32:20,450 --> 03:32:26,819
Probably gonna have to have a third.

2077
03:32:26,819 --> 03:32:28,379
Say that again, but in a dog accent.

2078
03:32:28,379 --> 03:32:47,520
Okay, I think I lose.

2079
03:32:47,520 --> 03:32:50,360
Oh, it depends how, if I can get past this fish,

2080
03:32:50,360 --> 03:32:52,239
then it's over.

2081
03:32:52,239 --> 03:32:59,860
Nine, fuck, no.

2082
03:32:59,860 --> 03:33:04,799
Does Jerma do literally everything Chat asks him to?

2083
03:33:04,799 --> 03:33:06,879
Not everything, just a majority.

2084
03:33:06,879 --> 03:33:11,559
Okay, now I gotta sit here for a second

2085
03:33:11,559 --> 03:33:16,360
because this gives everybody one one.

2086
03:33:16,360 --> 03:33:17,959
I wanna make sure the right people are up there.

2087
03:33:17,959 --> 03:33:20,430
This is gonna give somebody a two two.

2088
03:33:20,430 --> 03:33:24,110
This one I sell, it gives somebody a four two.

2089
03:33:24,110 --> 03:33:28,250
So I need, what do I do first?

2090
03:33:28,250 --> 03:33:32,190
Because I'm selling you, so I'm gonna have to do that first.

2091
03:33:32,190 --> 03:33:40,049
Let's do that, because I know I'm doing that.

2092
03:33:40,049 --> 03:33:43,290
That's the best person it could have just happened to.

2093
03:33:43,290 --> 03:33:50,020
Now we bring the otter in, right?

2094
03:33:50,020 --> 03:33:51,479
Otter is in.

2095
03:33:51,479 --> 03:33:56,180
Oh my, you, okay, come on.

2096
03:33:56,180 --> 03:34:06,079
Keep this fish, do I keep the penguin?

2097
03:34:06,079 --> 03:34:10,000
I don't know if I keep the penguin, I need more summons.

2098
03:34:10,040 --> 03:34:20,360
I need some bees and shit.

2099
03:34:20,360 --> 03:34:25,159
Or do I just do fish and then put the penguin up?

2100
03:34:25,159 --> 03:34:29,239
Because everybody, I have three level twos.

2101
03:34:29,239 --> 03:34:31,309
All right, I'm gonna go for it.

2102
03:34:31,309 --> 03:34:40,680
Let's do penguin first, and then let's go with the fish.

2103
03:34:40,680 --> 03:34:50,510
Stupid ass parrot, really.

2104
03:34:50,510 --> 03:34:53,670
Everyone's gonna get one one, except for the sheep,

2105
03:34:53,670 --> 03:34:57,000
but that's okay.

2106
03:34:57,000 --> 03:35:02,069
Dog needs to go last, right?

2107
03:35:02,069 --> 03:35:07,159
Well, all right, I have another chance after this.

2108
03:35:07,159 --> 03:35:13,399
That's too bad, a level tier five, that sucks.

2109
03:35:13,399 --> 03:35:21,030
Parrot and dog maybe, wait, I'll try it.

2110
03:35:21,030 --> 03:35:34,739
Sheep can't be in the front, that looks good.

2111
03:35:34,739 --> 03:35:42,799
I think I'm okay, looks okay.

2112
03:35:42,799 --> 03:35:59,469
He's a lot of buffs, I need more summons, bad.

2113
03:35:59,469 --> 03:36:07,000
Otherwise that dog is not gonna, shit, this is bad.

2114
03:36:07,000 --> 03:36:17,209
Very bad, very bad, I need more summons.

2115
03:36:17,209 --> 03:36:22,069
Damn it, this like turned out, this started so well.

2116
03:36:22,069 --> 03:36:27,719
I gotta get rid of the otter and the penguin probably.

2117
03:36:27,719 --> 03:36:34,950
No, I need somebody that summons shit.

2118
03:36:34,950 --> 03:36:43,879
Parrot the sheep, could parrot the sheep,

2119
03:36:43,879 --> 03:36:47,000
but let's do, I mean, this is just a no-brainer.

2120
03:36:47,000 --> 03:36:52,799
Let's roll for another sheep, and we got it.

2121
03:36:52,799 --> 03:36:54,319
And okay, this is good, this is perfect.

2122
03:36:54,319 --> 03:36:57,549
We're gonna parrot the sheep,

2123
03:36:57,549 --> 03:37:03,969
unless something crazy comes up.

2124
03:37:03,969 --> 03:37:07,879
That's not crazy, so here we go.

2125
03:37:07,879 --> 03:37:09,059
Let's get rid of the otter.

2126
03:37:09,059 --> 03:37:11,989
Should I get rid of the otter or the penguin?

2127
03:37:11,989 --> 03:37:26,079
Probably the otter, okay.

2128
03:37:26,079 --> 03:37:28,239
So now I get double the summons, it's gonna be two, four,

2129
03:37:28,239 --> 03:37:32,069
four rams, I'm gonna hold onto this food.

2130
03:37:32,069 --> 03:37:33,329
Hold onto both foods actually,

2131
03:37:33,329 --> 03:37:34,790
and see if I can get something good for the next round.

2132
03:37:34,790 --> 03:37:39,799
I have to survive this round.

2133
03:37:39,799 --> 03:37:45,530
No, I can't, why would I freeze that if I die, it's over.

2134
03:37:45,530 --> 03:37:51,229
Okay, well, this is it.

2135
03:37:51,229 --> 03:37:55,860
I think everyone's in the place that it possibly can be in.

2136
03:37:55,860 --> 03:37:56,700
We just hope that, I have to hope

2137
03:37:56,700 --> 03:38:01,569
that the dog can get buffed up.

2138
03:38:01,569 --> 03:38:03,090
There won't be enough room for the rams.

2139
03:38:03,090 --> 03:38:07,520
Should I move them back, like this?

2140
03:38:07,520 --> 03:38:16,500
I think that's the play, otherwise, yeah, I won't fit.

2141
03:38:16,500 --> 03:38:35,120
Okay, good luck, cute, darkest dungeon.

2142
03:38:35,120 --> 03:38:41,600
This is a victory, I get to go another time.

2143
03:38:41,600 --> 03:38:47,989
Oof, yes, I can, I think, unless that ox causes a problem,

2144
03:38:50,180 --> 03:39:00,190
which I think I'm fine, because here it comes again.

2145
03:39:00,190 --> 03:39:09,280
Nice, okay, we're good.

2146
03:39:09,280 --> 03:39:25,520
Darkest dungeon for kids.

2147
03:39:25,520 --> 03:39:35,620
I think I just throw this whole thing away.

2148
03:39:35,620 --> 03:39:49,659
I think it's, who am I gonna replace, the penguin?

2149
03:39:49,659 --> 03:39:52,680
It's too late, yeah, it's way too late.

2150
03:39:52,680 --> 03:39:56,229
Okay, the penguin gives three people one-one.

2151
03:39:56,229 --> 03:39:59,649
This is him giving himself one-one if he eats food.

2152
03:39:59,649 --> 03:40:01,569
It's just spread out more.

2153
03:40:01,569 --> 03:40:07,569
No, I gotta throw the whole thing away.

2154
03:40:11,020 --> 03:40:19,989
The whale could eat the parrot after he copies this, right?

2155
03:40:19,989 --> 03:40:24,739
So then we'd get, okay, whale the parrot,

2156
03:40:24,739 --> 03:40:26,659
because the parrot copies this.

2157
03:40:26,659 --> 03:40:36,420
This is gonna happen first.

2158
03:40:36,420 --> 03:40:38,280
Yeah, this is start of battle, swallow friend.

2159
03:40:38,280 --> 03:40:40,200
This is end turn, so he does this first.

2160
03:40:40,200 --> 03:40:44,020
Parrot does it first.

2161
03:40:44,020 --> 03:40:51,700
Use the can first, yeah, absolutely.

2162
03:40:51,700 --> 03:40:56,760
So if I get rid of the penguin, will this actually work?

2163
03:40:56,760 --> 03:41:07,639
I'm kinda curious, let's find out.

2164
03:41:07,639 --> 03:41:10,059
Because you're gonna copy your moves.

2165
03:41:10,059 --> 03:41:11,440
You're gonna die, become two.

2166
03:41:11,440 --> 03:41:12,719
You're gonna die, become two.

2167
03:41:12,719 --> 03:41:26,959
He's gonna spit you out, you're gonna die and become two.

2168
03:41:26,959 --> 03:41:29,799
Wait, the whale goes first.

2169
03:41:29,799 --> 03:41:35,139
Oh, wait a minute, yeah.

2170
03:41:35,139 --> 03:41:36,620
That's at the start of the battle,

2171
03:41:36,620 --> 03:41:38,700
so he's gonna eat him, he's gonna turn.

2172
03:41:38,700 --> 03:41:43,069
I think it still is more.

2173
03:41:43,069 --> 03:41:47,520
Okay, well, let's just go.

2174
03:41:47,520 --> 03:42:03,100
Jesus, am I actually gonna, I have to survive.

2175
03:42:03,139 --> 03:42:14,590
I think we just do sushi and just hope for the best.

2176
03:42:14,590 --> 03:42:17,950
Oh, I could put parrot in too.

2177
03:42:17,950 --> 03:42:19,590
Sushi gives three one ones.

2178
03:42:19,590 --> 03:42:22,209
This will give the parrot up to what?

2179
03:42:22,209 --> 03:42:25,260
Like a seven something, eight something?

2180
03:42:25,260 --> 03:42:28,350
I think that's actually better, yeah.

2181
03:42:28,350 --> 03:42:30,709
Eight seven's better.

2182
03:42:30,709 --> 03:42:31,629
We can save this next turn.

2183
03:42:31,629 --> 03:42:32,670
All right, if I survive,

2184
03:42:32,670 --> 03:42:42,260
then this is gonna be a pretty good turn.

2185
03:42:42,260 --> 03:42:46,940
Oh, hold on, I could've got rid of the whale.

2186
03:42:46,940 --> 03:42:49,440
The parrot copies the other parrot.

2187
03:42:50,440 --> 03:42:53,819
Does that work?

2188
03:42:53,819 --> 03:42:57,290
If I had put the parrot here, a second parrot,

2189
03:42:57,290 --> 03:43:00,610
would that have been he copies this person

2190
03:43:01,610 --> 03:43:03,799
or would he copy nothing?

2191
03:43:03,799 --> 03:43:05,000
Would the parrot copy nothing

2192
03:43:05,000 --> 03:43:08,540
and then this parrot copy something?

2193
03:43:08,540 --> 03:43:16,309
Oh well, let's just go.

2194
03:43:16,309 --> 03:43:17,430
It actually does work, oh,

2195
03:43:17,430 --> 03:43:22,459
because it goes right to left.

2196
03:43:22,459 --> 03:43:29,579
This might not be a loss.

2197
03:43:29,579 --> 03:43:41,579
I think I still win, possible.

2198
03:43:41,579 --> 03:43:48,149
Yeah, I definitely win.

2199
03:43:48,149 --> 03:43:50,229
Although this elephant's gotta fucking die right now

2200
03:43:50,229 --> 03:43:52,819
because he's puffing these things up like crazy.

2201
03:43:52,819 --> 03:44:05,250
Kill this thing.

2202
03:44:05,250 --> 03:44:07,690
Come on, there it is.

2203
03:44:07,690 --> 03:44:12,510
All right, here it comes, the two.

2204
03:44:12,510 --> 03:44:14,049
Hey, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute.

2205
03:44:14,049 --> 03:44:16,540
Wait just a second.

2206
03:44:16,540 --> 03:44:22,709
Wait just a second, what's going on here?

2207
03:44:22,709 --> 03:44:26,250
Why did he copy, why did that happen for?

2208
03:44:27,250 --> 03:44:30,440
It turns it into a normal parrot?

2209
03:44:30,440 --> 03:44:32,000
So when he eats something,

2210
03:44:32,000 --> 03:44:38,090
he just removes anything that was on it before?

2211
03:44:38,090 --> 03:44:45,090
Oh man, it makes an entirely new animal.

2212
03:44:45,090 --> 03:44:49,670
So it's all, okay, it's death was triggered,

2213
03:44:49,670 --> 03:44:51,750
which means it's a new parrot that comes out

2214
03:44:51,750 --> 03:44:58,329
that did not copy anything, please.

2215
03:44:58,329 --> 03:45:02,479
All right, last one, one more, I'm done.

2216
03:45:02,479 --> 03:45:13,920
Last one, this is it, this game's fun.

2217
03:45:13,920 --> 03:45:17,020
And you know what the best part about this game is?

2218
03:45:17,020 --> 03:45:19,579
I know that like, okay, Hearthstone Battlegrounds I love.

2219
03:45:19,579 --> 03:45:22,090
I used to play it all the time.

2220
03:45:22,090 --> 03:45:25,219
Obviously I haven't really played it recently at all.

2221
03:45:25,219 --> 03:45:26,700
But I like the fact that,

2222
03:45:26,700 --> 03:45:29,469
I don't know how this matchmaking works,

2223
03:45:29,469 --> 03:45:34,840
but the fact that I can just sit here for an hour

2224
03:45:34,840 --> 03:45:40,309
and not even do anything.

2225
03:45:40,309 --> 03:45:46,450
I don't understand how the matchmaking works.

2226
03:45:46,450 --> 03:45:51,799
All right, well, I think we're just gonna pick this team.

2227
03:45:51,799 --> 03:45:59,090
Skeeto's fine early.

2228
03:45:59,090 --> 03:46:08,149
I think I'm gonna roll, good thing I did.

2229
03:46:08,149 --> 03:46:12,569
How about the obese posers, the obese feet,

2230
03:46:12,569 --> 03:46:19,260
the skilled feet, the skilled posers,

2231
03:46:19,260 --> 03:46:25,459
obese posers, that's so stupid.

2232
03:46:25,459 --> 03:46:35,450
The fussy piggies, you already buffed that, how?

2233
03:46:35,450 --> 03:46:52,319
Ooh, that's huge, that's bad.

2234
03:46:52,319 --> 03:46:53,780
Game's results are predetermined from the start.

2235
03:46:53,780 --> 03:46:56,930
You just watch it unfold before your eyes.

2236
03:46:56,930 --> 03:46:59,809
How is it matchmaking people?

2237
03:46:59,809 --> 03:47:01,729
Is it just based on how many trophies

2238
03:47:01,729 --> 03:47:02,649
and how many hearts you have

2239
03:47:02,649 --> 03:47:04,090
and it just finds somebody else

2240
03:47:04,090 --> 03:47:12,040
that has that amount of hearts and trophies?

2241
03:47:12,040 --> 03:47:18,100
That's a really cool way to do this.

2242
03:47:18,100 --> 03:47:22,690
It's by turn, if you're on the same turn.

2243
03:47:22,690 --> 03:47:27,659
That's kind of cool,

2244
03:47:27,659 --> 03:47:30,020
because it really doesn't even matter

2245
03:47:30,020 --> 03:47:35,809
when you press the button.

2246
03:47:35,809 --> 03:47:37,750
These are old teams from the past that are saved.

2247
03:47:37,750 --> 03:47:44,209
These aren't live, really?

2248
03:47:44,209 --> 03:47:52,440
So they're ghosts of other teams

2249
03:47:52,440 --> 03:47:54,799
that would explain the lack of timer.

2250
03:47:54,799 --> 03:48:03,600
That's really, really actually, that's really cool.

2251
03:48:03,600 --> 03:48:07,510
There's always like a saved team somewhere.

2252
03:48:07,510 --> 03:48:09,309
Someone is losing to you right now

2253
03:48:09,309 --> 03:48:17,559
or beating you from like yesterday or like an hour ago.

2254
03:48:17,559 --> 03:48:24,319
That's some pretty big brain game development right there.

2255
03:48:24,319 --> 03:48:25,520
What do I wanna do?

2256
03:48:25,520 --> 03:48:35,120
I think I'm throwing this whole hand away, good.

2257
03:48:36,239 --> 03:48:39,850
Excuse me, hold on a second.

2258
03:48:39,850 --> 03:48:43,200
I've right-clicked and dragged.

2259
03:48:43,200 --> 03:48:47,760
I swear to God, I swear on everything.

2260
03:48:47,760 --> 03:48:51,200
You even saw me hesitate.

2261
03:48:51,200 --> 03:48:52,200
I hesitated and I was like,

2262
03:48:52,200 --> 03:48:53,680
wait, I wanna make sure I'm right-clicking

2263
03:48:53,680 --> 03:48:55,680
and I right-clicked and dragged.

2264
03:48:55,680 --> 03:48:59,940
It's not, it doesn't matter.

2265
03:48:59,940 --> 03:49:07,739
Oh yeah, okay, well, let's, now I have to buy a beaver.

2266
03:49:07,739 --> 03:49:10,680
I need, I need stats.

2267
03:49:10,680 --> 03:49:12,040
I just, I have to buy the duck too.

2268
03:49:12,040 --> 03:49:22,840
Like I need stats now, I'm screwed.

2269
03:49:22,840 --> 03:49:23,959
Single click and move them

2270
03:49:23,959 --> 03:49:30,180
if you're worried about them mixing.

2271
03:49:30,180 --> 03:49:31,059
This team is awful.

2272
03:49:31,059 --> 03:49:32,260
Well, it's about to be pretty good

2273
03:49:32,260 --> 03:49:49,170
because I'm gonna sell the duck immediately.

2274
03:49:49,170 --> 03:49:56,860
God damn it, I think I still would have lost.

2275
03:49:56,860 --> 03:50:03,489
We're doing that for sure, because I want the peacock.

2276
03:50:03,489 --> 03:50:08,540
Peacock, I'm gonna combine the beaver, I think,

2277
03:50:08,540 --> 03:50:20,100
or just sell, see what I get.

2278
03:50:20,100 --> 03:50:25,540
Very nice, all is not lost.

2279
03:50:25,540 --> 03:50:35,840
Yes, it is.

2280
03:50:35,840 --> 03:50:38,200
Heal attack damage to adjacent pets.

2281
03:50:38,200 --> 03:50:48,319
That sucks, it needs to be last.

2282
03:50:48,319 --> 03:50:51,000
The badger in the back?

2283
03:50:51,000 --> 03:51:11,000
Combine the beavers, put the badger in the back.

2284
03:51:14,479 --> 03:51:19,479
No, did you fart?

2285
03:51:29,149 --> 03:51:31,129
Worst voice.

2286
03:51:31,129 --> 03:51:35,239
Speaking of worst voice, the nominees are gonna open up

2287
03:51:35,239 --> 03:51:39,569
probably in like a week or two, maybe like two weeks.

2288
03:51:39,569 --> 03:51:42,729
For you to nominate things for worst and best of the year,

2289
03:51:42,729 --> 03:51:45,639
you'll have some categories to look through.

2290
03:51:45,639 --> 03:51:48,520
Categories will be known in advance.

2291
03:51:48,520 --> 03:51:59,500
I'm hoping for the first week of December.

2292
03:51:59,500 --> 03:52:12,629
Finally, victory, crying out loud.

2293
03:52:12,629 --> 03:52:16,190
I didn't see the last part, apparently.

2294
03:52:16,190 --> 03:52:21,629
Kill the ant, hopefully it goes to, all right.

2295
03:52:21,629 --> 03:52:25,600
I'm gonna sell the mosquito.

2296
03:52:25,600 --> 03:52:26,440
Let me roll.

2297
03:52:26,440 --> 03:52:30,030
Sell the mosquito, kill the ant,

2298
03:52:30,030 --> 03:52:34,540
hope it lands on the peacock.

2299
03:52:34,540 --> 03:52:37,079
Sell the mosquito, sell the beaver.

2300
03:52:37,079 --> 03:52:43,639
But then I'm killing everybody.

2301
03:52:43,639 --> 03:52:46,549
All right, I know I'm selling the mosquito.

2302
03:52:46,549 --> 03:52:49,729
I sell the beaver, hopefully it gives it the health to him.

2303
03:52:49,729 --> 03:52:53,020
Sell your kidneys.

2304
03:52:53,020 --> 03:52:56,930
This sucks, but I kinda have to do it.

2305
03:52:56,930 --> 03:53:03,000
Shit, no more crabs.

2306
03:53:03,000 --> 03:53:05,590
Oh, the elephant, shit, you're right.

2307
03:53:05,590 --> 03:53:07,069
All right, we're good.

2308
03:53:07,069 --> 03:53:11,309
Okay, sell the beaver.

2309
03:53:11,309 --> 03:53:14,239
That sucks, but whatever.

2310
03:53:14,239 --> 03:53:18,819
Okay, now, I'm gonna have to pick, oh shit, okay.

2311
03:53:18,819 --> 03:53:28,719
Is this stupid, what I'm doing?

2312
03:53:28,719 --> 03:53:33,120
Do I just buy the swan?

2313
03:53:33,120 --> 03:53:35,750
Or should I roll for something better?

2314
03:53:35,750 --> 03:53:43,209
Crab on the peacock, swan it up.

2315
03:53:43,209 --> 03:53:45,379
It would be an eight health crab.

2316
03:53:45,379 --> 03:53:50,049
Yeah, that's probably better for right now.

2317
03:53:50,049 --> 03:53:51,959
I am gonna, no I'm not.

2318
03:54:02,989 --> 03:54:15,639
I could just, okay, I got an idea.

2319
03:54:15,639 --> 03:54:19,020
Why do I have a sus command?

2320
03:54:19,020 --> 03:54:24,120
Because I've, okay, I've been around,

2321
03:54:24,120 --> 03:54:25,479
it's not Among Us.

2322
03:54:25,479 --> 03:54:29,600
Before Among Us, I did a thing like five years ago.

2323
03:54:29,600 --> 03:54:32,670
I don't even know how to explain this.

2324
03:54:32,670 --> 03:54:34,750
It's part of a game, it's part of a game called Sorcery.

2325
03:54:34,750 --> 03:55:02,420
Steve, okay, well, it's, I have not lost or won anything.

2326
03:55:02,420 --> 03:55:04,909
What do we got?

2327
03:55:04,909 --> 03:55:06,870
I know that's gonna happen.

2328
03:55:06,870 --> 03:55:12,440
Wait, okay, so if I give this to the peacock,

2329
03:55:12,440 --> 03:55:15,440
if he doesn't actually take the damage,

2330
03:55:15,440 --> 03:55:20,229
that means he doesn't get the buff, right?

2331
03:55:20,229 --> 03:55:22,649
If I garlic the peacock,

2332
03:55:22,649 --> 03:55:26,590
it's not technically gonna get hurt.

2333
03:55:26,590 --> 03:55:27,709
Needs to be hurt, right?

2334
03:55:27,709 --> 03:55:29,030
So wouldn't it go to zero,

2335
03:55:29,030 --> 03:55:32,479
because he does one damage.

2336
03:55:32,479 --> 03:55:38,479
It doesn't any hurt, it has to be a minimum of one damage.

2337
03:55:38,479 --> 03:55:42,100
Garlic blocks to a minimum of one damage, not to zero.

2338
03:55:42,940 --> 03:55:45,530
That's not what it says.

2339
03:55:45,530 --> 03:55:48,170
Will always do at least one, even with garlic.

2340
03:55:48,170 --> 03:55:57,809
Okay, now the question is,

2341
03:55:57,809 --> 03:56:01,239
I don't really want the rabbit.

2342
03:56:01,239 --> 03:56:02,719
Do I want the food?

2343
03:56:02,719 --> 03:56:09,950
All right, let's see what happens.

2344
03:56:09,950 --> 03:56:28,440
Okay, I need another unit though, don't I?

2345
03:56:28,440 --> 03:56:32,100
That will make him a eight.

2346
03:56:32,100 --> 03:56:54,840
It doesn't, makes him an eight, eight.

2347
03:56:54,840 --> 03:56:58,540
I think I got this one.

2348
03:56:58,540 --> 03:57:02,049
That's wonderful, actually, what just happened.

2349
03:57:02,049 --> 03:57:11,760
That was unbelievable what just happened.

2350
03:57:11,760 --> 03:57:14,020
All right, well, he's gonna die regardless,

2351
03:57:14,020 --> 03:57:21,200
but at least he'll kill the whale.

2352
03:57:21,200 --> 03:57:26,829
Shit, it's okay though.

2353
03:57:27,790 --> 03:57:31,700
Turns out the crab was a great, oh, that's bad.

2354
03:57:31,700 --> 03:57:40,549
Ooh, oh, that's actually pretty good,

2355
03:57:40,549 --> 03:57:42,229
because it does its attack damage to,

2356
03:57:42,229 --> 03:57:44,190
now it makes sense as to why you use this.

2357
03:57:44,190 --> 03:57:49,370
I thought this thing was terrible.

2358
03:57:49,370 --> 03:57:58,760
All right, puffer fish.

2359
03:57:58,760 --> 03:58:00,879
Okay, if this guy gets to level two,

2360
03:58:00,879 --> 03:58:05,110
he does one damage to two things behind him.

2361
03:58:05,110 --> 03:58:06,790
So the puffer fish would make sense,

2362
03:58:06,790 --> 03:58:20,229
but I need another elephant to be on the badger.

2363
03:58:20,229 --> 03:58:28,809
I'm gonna stop freezing this guy.

2364
03:58:28,809 --> 03:58:35,440
I need an elephant or a honey, but I'm out of money.

2365
03:58:35,440 --> 03:58:42,819
So I think I'm just gonna have to, I'm not sure.

2366
03:58:43,139 --> 03:58:58,479
Should I just feed the badger and put the puffer up?

2367
03:58:58,479 --> 03:59:01,350
But he's only gonna hit one behind,

2368
03:59:01,350 --> 03:59:05,290
and the crab needs to copy the peacock.

2369
03:59:05,290 --> 03:59:07,090
The peacock is the one that gets the most benefit

2370
03:59:07,090 --> 03:59:10,299
from getting hit by this.

2371
03:59:10,299 --> 03:59:11,940
Okay, if I do this, I just have to really hope

2372
03:59:11,940 --> 03:59:14,559
that I get a second elephant.

2373
03:59:14,559 --> 03:59:26,600
That's what this whole thing is based around.

2374
03:59:26,600 --> 03:59:28,840
All right, well, I'm gonna feed the badger,

2375
03:59:28,840 --> 03:59:34,190
because that's six damage,

2376
03:59:34,190 --> 03:59:36,739
and I'm just gonna have to see if this works.

2377
03:59:36,739 --> 03:59:39,709
Put the puffer in the front.

2378
03:59:39,709 --> 03:59:44,790
I feel like he's just gonna die instantly,

2379
03:59:44,790 --> 03:59:46,870
because you have to get hurt and stay alive.

2380
03:59:46,870 --> 03:59:52,620
If you die, you don't get to do it.

2381
03:59:52,620 --> 04:00:01,819
Yeah, it has to be like this.

2382
04:00:01,819 --> 04:00:03,700
All right, well, hopefully I get a,

2383
04:00:03,700 --> 04:00:06,569
I have nine health.

2384
04:00:06,569 --> 04:00:10,469
I just have to hope that I get another elephant.

2385
04:00:10,469 --> 04:00:12,469
Another elephant, this is much better.

2386
04:00:12,469 --> 04:00:25,139
It looks really good, actually.

2387
04:00:25,139 --> 04:00:32,040
Well, at least that dies.

2388
04:00:32,040 --> 04:00:36,829
Very good, very good.

2389
04:00:36,829 --> 04:00:38,889
But is it good enough?

2390
04:00:38,889 --> 04:00:39,709
Is it good enough?

2391
04:00:39,709 --> 04:00:52,500
It is.

2392
04:00:52,500 --> 04:00:56,610
Give me an elephant, give me another elephant.

2393
04:00:56,610 --> 04:01:05,840
Give me another elephant or another puffer.

2394
04:01:05,840 --> 04:01:17,110
I should garlic the puffer.

2395
04:01:17,110 --> 04:01:20,500
Elephant, elephant.

2396
04:01:20,500 --> 04:01:22,780
Shit, damn it.

2397
04:01:22,780 --> 04:01:27,209
No, crab?

2398
04:01:27,250 --> 04:01:29,450
Would this potentially triple?

2399
04:01:29,450 --> 04:01:31,049
What happens if this does not upgrade

2400
04:01:31,049 --> 04:01:39,459
when leveling, nevermind, okay.

2401
04:01:39,459 --> 04:01:56,870
I think it's just be the badger,

2402
04:01:56,870 --> 04:01:58,510
because that's gonna do seven damage.

2403
04:01:58,510 --> 04:02:01,250
I'm just trying to win attrition here.

2404
04:02:01,250 --> 04:02:03,260
I'm trying just to stay alive,

2405
04:02:03,260 --> 04:02:06,200
so I can really level up the elephant.

2406
04:02:06,200 --> 04:02:07,079
So if everything dies,

2407
04:02:07,079 --> 04:02:09,600
but at least it kills the last thing,

2408
04:02:09,600 --> 04:02:13,399
I wanna make sure it can.

2409
04:02:13,399 --> 04:02:16,420
Well, kill that monkey in the back, come on.

2410
04:02:16,420 --> 04:02:24,129
Again, shit, sorry.

2411
04:02:24,129 --> 04:02:26,209
Brutal, that's bad, but it's okay.

2412
04:02:26,209 --> 04:02:30,860
I think it's still, yep, I'm good.

2413
04:02:30,860 --> 04:02:40,370
Badger stays alive.

2414
04:02:40,370 --> 04:02:43,260
Nice, very nice.

2415
04:02:43,260 --> 04:02:45,200
Finally, elephant.

2416
04:02:45,200 --> 04:02:51,309
Then he'll be doing damage to two people behind him.

2417
04:02:51,309 --> 04:02:52,709
Turkey, I don't have anything.

2418
04:02:52,709 --> 04:02:56,879
I just don't have anything that's good enough for it.

2419
04:02:56,879 --> 04:03:06,950
All right, I have no summons really.

2420
04:03:06,950 --> 04:03:15,200
I'll take it.

2421
04:03:15,200 --> 04:03:16,520
Place the crab with the turkey.

2422
04:03:16,520 --> 04:03:19,120
I don't think so, nothing's summoned.

2423
04:03:19,120 --> 04:03:28,090
I don't have any summons.

2424
04:03:28,090 --> 04:03:30,930
Oh, there's honey for the badger, right?

2425
04:03:30,930 --> 04:03:32,030
Do I wanna do that?

2426
04:03:32,030 --> 04:03:39,969
I think that's what I wanna do,

2427
04:03:39,969 --> 04:03:46,879
because then, ooh, I want that too.

2428
04:03:46,879 --> 04:03:52,010
Who do I replace?

2429
04:03:52,010 --> 04:03:56,780
I don't think I can even take the monkey.

2430
04:03:56,780 --> 04:04:01,290
I like this team.

2431
04:04:01,290 --> 04:04:06,709
Well, we'll find out.

2432
04:04:06,709 --> 04:04:10,579
Now this is gonna get very interesting.

2433
04:04:10,579 --> 04:04:11,420
I need to start scaling.

2434
04:04:11,420 --> 04:04:25,040
Yeah, that's true, nice.

2435
04:04:25,040 --> 04:04:35,799
At least you gotta do it once, bad.

2436
04:04:35,799 --> 04:04:37,159
Crab has been carrying.

2437
04:04:37,159 --> 04:04:40,120
Look at what the crab's been doing here.

2438
04:04:40,120 --> 04:04:43,399
Oh, come on.

2439
04:04:43,399 --> 04:04:46,760
No, shit, it hit the wrong person.

2440
04:04:46,760 --> 04:04:51,280
Oh no.

2441
04:04:51,280 --> 04:05:03,719
Oh well.

2442
04:05:03,719 --> 04:05:06,989
I think I have to replace the badger.

2443
04:05:06,989 --> 04:05:08,909
Crab has been doing so well.

2444
04:05:08,909 --> 04:05:23,360
He's a nine, 10.

2445
04:05:23,360 --> 04:05:27,629
Crab's gonna start to fall off.

2446
04:05:27,629 --> 04:05:31,040
It's the badger and crab for the monkey and the elephant.

2447
04:05:31,040 --> 04:05:38,049
Really start growing your front three.

2448
04:05:38,809 --> 04:05:40,250
Maybe it is time to get rid of the crab

2449
04:05:40,250 --> 04:05:43,100
and just put the monkey out.

2450
04:05:43,100 --> 04:05:45,149
Yeah, it's probably the play.

2451
04:05:50,159 --> 04:06:01,250
So then he'll be constantly giving the elephant tutu.

2452
04:06:01,250 --> 04:06:02,170
Keep you in the back.

2453
04:06:02,170 --> 04:06:03,389
All right, let's feed the elephant.

2454
04:06:03,389 --> 04:06:04,649
No, actually, not yet.

2455
04:06:04,649 --> 04:06:11,680
They might be better food.

2456
04:06:11,680 --> 04:06:17,799
I, okay.

2457
04:06:17,799 --> 04:06:21,079
I don't know if I wanna do this right now,

2458
04:06:21,079 --> 04:06:24,649
because I think I wanna give the cupcake to the elephant.

2459
04:06:24,649 --> 04:06:41,719
I don't wanna lose.

2460
04:06:41,719 --> 04:06:42,879
The elephant has to survive

2461
04:06:42,879 --> 04:06:49,000
with the peacock upgrade to even matter.

2462
04:06:49,000 --> 04:06:54,040
Camel might be a good replacement with the...

2463
04:06:54,079 --> 04:06:58,659
All right, wait a minute.

2464
04:06:58,659 --> 04:06:59,540
Camel gets hit.

2465
04:06:59,540 --> 04:07:02,680
It gives one, two to the person behind,

2466
04:07:02,680 --> 04:07:06,309
which is the peacock, which gets two.

2467
04:07:06,309 --> 04:07:10,690
So it would be giving every time the elephant attacks,

2468
04:07:10,690 --> 04:07:14,340
the peacock would be getting three, two

2469
04:07:14,340 --> 04:07:19,000
every time the elephant attacks,

2470
04:07:19,000 --> 04:07:25,149
which that's kind of insane.

2471
04:07:25,149 --> 04:07:40,700
I'm gonna go for it.

2472
04:07:40,700 --> 04:07:42,530
Two gold.

2473
04:07:42,530 --> 04:07:47,489
Do I freeze the cupcake?

2474
04:07:47,489 --> 04:07:50,969
All right, we got something else to hold on to.

2475
04:07:50,969 --> 04:07:55,639
Really?

2476
04:07:55,639 --> 04:08:00,229
Oh, it's too late for the scorpion,

2477
04:08:00,229 --> 04:08:04,440
unless I wanna get rid of the monkey.

2478
04:08:04,559 --> 04:08:05,520
The cupcake is temporary,

2479
04:08:05,520 --> 04:08:12,489
but at this stage, I probably need it to scale.

2480
04:08:12,489 --> 04:08:15,959
Actually, the salad does kind of suck right now.

2481
04:08:15,959 --> 04:08:17,459
It's never too late for the scorpion.

2482
04:08:17,459 --> 04:08:18,700
Yeah, but who do I replace?

2483
04:08:18,700 --> 04:08:20,540
The monkey?

2484
04:08:20,540 --> 04:08:22,020
I feel like the monkey needs to be here for a few turns

2485
04:08:22,020 --> 04:08:31,059
for him to be worth even buying in the first place.

2486
04:08:31,059 --> 04:08:33,399
Yeah, I don't think I even care about this.

2487
04:08:33,399 --> 04:08:35,559
It's too late now.

2488
04:08:35,559 --> 04:08:43,360
I'm going with this as this meta here.

2489
04:08:43,360 --> 04:08:49,649
I have to hope that the peacock just goes absolutely crazy.

2490
04:08:49,649 --> 04:08:51,200
All right, there we go.

2491
04:08:51,200 --> 04:08:56,809
It should see at least a few hits.

2492
04:08:56,809 --> 04:08:58,500
Here it is.

2493
04:08:58,500 --> 04:09:01,270
Boom, boom.

2494
04:09:01,270 --> 04:09:02,909
It's gonna kill the...

2495
04:09:02,950 --> 04:09:05,100
All right, nice, perfect.

2496
04:09:05,100 --> 04:09:07,120
That counts though, cause it was alive.

2497
04:09:07,120 --> 04:09:07,959
Does it not count?

2498
04:09:07,959 --> 04:09:10,639
It was alive when it happened though, right?

2499
04:09:10,639 --> 04:09:14,829
Does it not count?

2500
04:09:14,829 --> 04:09:16,979
Oh, this is perfect.

2501
04:09:16,979 --> 04:09:21,219
Am I gonna be able to kill the dog because of this?

2502
04:09:21,219 --> 04:09:23,299
Oh, come on, no.

2503
04:09:23,299 --> 04:09:24,920
Damn it.

2504
04:09:24,920 --> 04:09:26,809
Get that shit out of here.

2505
04:09:31,899 --> 04:09:43,000
Oh well, I think I still lost anyways.

2506
04:09:43,000 --> 04:09:47,790
Well, I can't die again.

2507
04:09:47,790 --> 04:09:49,239
Aye, aye, aye.

2508
04:09:49,239 --> 04:09:55,569
Oh, this is a certain play here.

2509
04:09:55,569 --> 04:09:59,520
Gain four attack.

2510
04:09:59,520 --> 04:10:09,510
Why a tier one pet give all friends one one?

2511
04:10:09,510 --> 04:10:19,979
Elephant, elephant.

2512
04:10:20,020 --> 04:10:25,190
Maybe get rid of the badger.

2513
04:10:25,190 --> 04:10:26,229
Freeze the dragon maybe.

2514
04:10:26,229 --> 04:10:30,350
All right, elephant, cupcake on elephant.

2515
04:10:30,350 --> 04:10:38,200
Do double elephant?

2516
04:10:38,200 --> 04:10:40,440
Get rid of a badger.

2517
04:10:40,440 --> 04:10:45,659
Go with just double elephant.

2518
04:10:45,659 --> 04:10:48,799
I think so.

2519
04:10:48,799 --> 04:10:51,850
Go for a camel upgrade.

2520
04:10:51,850 --> 04:10:55,399
Wait, wouldn't double elephant not make any sense?

2521
04:10:55,399 --> 04:10:57,690
Because it has to attack.

2522
04:10:57,690 --> 04:11:01,520
So wouldn't I just be hitting my own elephant?

2523
04:11:01,520 --> 04:11:05,649
I don't think that's a good idea.

2524
04:11:05,649 --> 04:11:09,229
I mean, I could upgrade the elephant again.

2525
04:11:09,229 --> 04:11:14,399
That uses all my money.

2526
04:11:14,399 --> 04:11:28,290
I don't know, I almost kind of want to look for the camel.

2527
04:11:28,290 --> 04:11:30,389
I wonder if I should try to upgrade the elephant

2528
04:11:30,389 --> 04:11:35,879
or should I just roll everything and look for the camel?

2529
04:11:35,879 --> 04:11:37,000
Where is it to level the elephant?

2530
04:11:37,000 --> 04:11:40,760
I have to survive though.

2531
04:11:40,760 --> 04:11:48,950
Whatever.

2532
04:11:48,950 --> 04:11:51,590
Okay, all right.

2533
04:11:51,590 --> 04:11:56,739
All right, we're going to do this

2534
04:11:56,739 --> 04:12:09,840
and just hope for the best.

2535
04:12:09,840 --> 04:12:18,670
Is it enough?

2536
04:12:18,670 --> 04:12:29,290
Hey, it's at least enough to do it twice and go.

2537
04:12:29,290 --> 04:12:32,239
Come on, get that shit out of here.

2538
04:12:32,239 --> 04:12:35,750
Do I lose?

2539
04:12:35,750 --> 04:12:40,069
I think it's still, let's see, seven, seven times.

2540
04:12:46,950 --> 04:12:47,790
Damn it.

2541
04:12:47,790 --> 04:12:52,020
No, I only had two wins.

2542
04:12:52,020 --> 04:12:52,940
All right, one more.

2543
04:12:52,940 --> 04:12:55,280
This is actually the last one, I promise.

2544
04:12:55,280 --> 04:13:13,059
Last one.

2545
04:13:13,059 --> 04:13:16,700
I'm going with this.

2546
04:13:16,700 --> 04:13:22,379
The leaking soup, the inedible bush.

2547
04:13:22,379 --> 04:13:28,379
Inedible bushes, inedible soup.

2548
04:13:28,379 --> 04:13:38,100
Leaking package, leaking packages.

2549
04:13:38,100 --> 04:13:51,200
That's okay.

2550
04:13:51,200 --> 04:13:53,790
Let chat play.

2551
04:13:53,790 --> 04:14:01,340
It's a games free, you can play right now.

2552
04:14:01,340 --> 04:14:02,659
I was going to say if I didn't win this,

2553
04:14:02,659 --> 04:14:05,420
or if I didn't turn this into a draw,

2554
04:14:05,420 --> 04:14:23,000
this is going to, I don't know, I'm not happy.

2555
04:14:23,000 --> 04:14:25,680
Here we go.

2556
04:14:25,680 --> 04:14:37,920
Okay, hold on a minute here.

2557
04:14:37,920 --> 04:14:40,670
Remember, stop losing.

2558
04:14:40,670 --> 04:14:54,420
I'm still learning.

2559
04:14:54,420 --> 04:14:55,979
Why do you have a four, five duck?

2560
04:14:55,979 --> 04:14:58,979
What happened?

2561
04:14:59,020 --> 04:15:33,500
You have a four, five duck?

2562
04:15:33,500 --> 04:15:42,040
Okay, and then maybe a spider.

2563
04:15:42,040 --> 04:15:47,319
Spider in front, probably of the kangaroo.

2564
04:15:47,319 --> 04:15:53,239
And I can't wait to get rid of this duck.

2565
04:15:53,239 --> 04:15:58,569
Okay, good, let's go.

2566
04:15:58,569 --> 04:16:04,069
Nice, very nice.

2567
04:16:04,069 --> 04:16:05,950
Don't talk with food in your mouth.

2568
04:16:05,950 --> 04:16:09,360
All right, can't wait for the next six

2569
04:16:09,360 --> 04:16:13,860
super auto pet streams.

2570
04:16:13,860 --> 04:16:18,829
I mean, this game is just, passes time very, very easily.

2571
04:16:18,829 --> 04:16:24,450
It takes 15 seconds to open this and get in a game.

2572
04:16:24,450 --> 04:16:26,149
It's not like I wouldn't ever play it again,

2573
04:16:26,149 --> 04:16:28,069
but I don't know.

2574
04:16:28,069 --> 04:16:34,079
I think it's fun.

2575
04:16:34,079 --> 04:16:44,350
Very good.

2576
04:16:45,030 --> 04:16:48,750
Let's go ahead and get this out of the way.

2577
04:16:48,750 --> 04:16:51,340
All right, turtle is, okay.

2578
04:16:51,340 --> 04:16:58,440
Sell the duck, turtle going up.

2579
04:16:58,440 --> 04:17:01,379
And I want turtle to go in front of the kangaroo.

2580
04:17:01,379 --> 04:17:02,219
No, I don't.

2581
04:17:02,219 --> 04:17:11,219
Who do I want the turtle to go in front of?

2582
04:17:11,219 --> 04:17:14,139
I think I want to do, okay, hold on.

2583
04:17:14,139 --> 04:17:25,370
In front of the spider, but I think I need to, I don't know.

2584
04:17:25,370 --> 04:17:31,700
Sell the cricket or, and crab.

2585
04:17:31,700 --> 04:17:36,149
Yeah, but he has the five damage on him though.

2586
04:17:36,149 --> 04:17:37,149
Is he even being funny?

2587
04:17:37,149 --> 04:17:39,190
Dude, yeah, the reason why I'm so tired is I just,

2588
04:17:39,190 --> 04:17:44,190
I did a, I just did a three hour nonstop standup routine.

2589
04:17:44,190 --> 04:17:46,329
Just like kind of chilling now.

2590
04:17:46,370 --> 04:17:58,159
I'm exhausted.

2591
04:18:02,450 --> 04:18:05,780
Kangaroo has to see somebody in front of him attack.

2592
04:18:05,780 --> 04:18:07,860
Turtle, when it dies,

2593
04:18:07,860 --> 04:18:11,450
it gives melon armor to the person behind it.

2594
04:18:11,450 --> 04:18:15,860
I guess it'd have to be here.

2595
04:18:15,860 --> 04:18:18,709
And then I want to do this.

2596
04:18:18,709 --> 04:18:37,129
This is stupid, probably, but maybe.

2597
04:18:37,129 --> 04:18:41,250
This is stupid, but whatever.

2598
04:18:41,250 --> 04:18:43,069
Melon, oh, that's right.

2599
04:18:43,069 --> 04:18:47,790
Melon armor, it cancels because it's its own thing.

2600
04:18:55,540 --> 04:18:57,280
Well, I'm kind of screwed now.

2601
04:18:57,280 --> 04:19:03,850
I think I have to do this or do this.

2602
04:19:03,850 --> 04:19:05,250
Then the kangaroo doesn't give very much benefit.

2603
04:19:05,489 --> 04:19:13,760
Yeah, I messed this up a little bit.

2604
04:19:13,760 --> 04:19:14,760
Okay, so then he can hit.

2605
04:19:14,760 --> 04:19:17,299
Yeah, that makes more sense.

2606
04:19:17,299 --> 04:19:20,750
All right, let's go.

2607
04:19:20,750 --> 04:19:22,469
The spider will get to hit at least,

2608
04:19:22,469 --> 04:19:23,709
I'm going to lose the bee,

2609
04:19:23,709 --> 04:19:34,430
but it's being replaced by swinging at least twice.

2610
04:19:34,430 --> 04:19:36,030
I've been streaming for four and a half hours.

2611
04:19:36,030 --> 04:19:37,389
What the fuck is going on here?

2612
04:19:37,389 --> 04:19:53,559
I was supposed to be live for like 45 minutes.

2613
04:19:53,559 --> 04:20:02,739
Yeah, that's, that's good.

2614
04:20:02,739 --> 04:20:07,909
All right, that's two wins.

2615
04:20:07,909 --> 04:20:13,860
Okay, thinking about, let's upgrade the spider,

2616
04:20:13,860 --> 04:20:24,719
sell the ant, sell the ant, upgrade spider.

2617
04:20:24,719 --> 04:20:26,280
I don't think anyone's leaving right now,

2618
04:20:26,280 --> 04:20:29,159
although hold on.

2619
04:20:30,159 --> 04:20:35,209
Let me just make sure no one else is leaving.

2620
04:20:35,209 --> 04:20:37,209
Or I could pill the turtle

2621
04:20:37,209 --> 04:20:53,120
and then they get permanent melon armor.

2622
04:20:53,120 --> 04:20:56,739
That's not bad.

2623
04:20:56,739 --> 04:20:57,579
That works, right?

2624
04:20:57,579 --> 04:21:02,139
And then the spider will have a melon armor forever.

2625
04:21:02,139 --> 04:21:08,799
I can pill the ant later, the pill will show up again.

2626
04:21:08,799 --> 04:21:11,360
You'll sell the spider in not too long from now though.

2627
04:21:11,360 --> 04:21:20,020
Will I, even if I upgrade them,

2628
04:21:20,020 --> 04:21:24,239
pill the turtle on the kangaroo?

2629
04:21:24,239 --> 04:21:30,930
That's not a bad idea.

2630
04:21:30,930 --> 04:21:38,290
I like that idea.

2631
04:21:38,290 --> 04:21:41,639
Want to do this or do I?

2632
04:21:41,639 --> 04:21:51,229
Let's roll.

2633
04:21:51,229 --> 04:21:52,670
Hold on to this in case I lose.

2634
04:21:52,670 --> 04:21:57,500
What do I want to do here?

2635
04:21:57,500 --> 04:22:20,799
Swan, I could do Swan and level up.

2636
04:22:20,840 --> 04:22:28,430
Interesting, nice.

2637
04:22:28,430 --> 04:22:29,350
Very, very nice.

2638
04:22:29,350 --> 04:22:30,469
I'm really happy about that.

2639
04:22:30,469 --> 04:22:46,590
All right, let's go.

2640
04:22:46,590 --> 04:22:47,430
This is going to be bad.

2641
04:22:47,430 --> 04:23:02,440
I should have had the cricket go first.

2642
04:23:02,440 --> 04:23:06,829
Hey, very nice.

2643
04:23:06,829 --> 04:23:09,629
It's not going to be enough, I don't think.

2644
04:23:09,629 --> 04:23:23,100
Let's see, it is not.

2645
04:23:23,100 --> 04:23:28,159
Okay, so I'm going to pill the ant,

2646
04:23:28,159 --> 04:23:33,569
play the snail, sell the snail.

2647
04:23:33,569 --> 04:23:39,899
Go ahead and do that.

2648
04:23:39,899 --> 04:23:46,100
Pill the ant.

2649
04:23:46,100 --> 04:23:48,260
I didn't want you to get that, but whatever.

2650
04:23:48,260 --> 04:24:04,879
Snail, sell the snail, meet the swan.

2651
04:24:04,879 --> 04:24:12,379
I mean, maybe the badger.

2652
04:24:17,270 --> 04:24:25,469
I think that's the play.

2653
04:24:25,469 --> 04:24:31,709
I roll the whole thing in case,

2654
04:24:31,709 --> 04:24:33,909
because I'm going to sell something next turn anyways.

2655
04:24:33,909 --> 04:24:35,510
These are not good right now.

2656
04:24:35,510 --> 04:24:38,829
All right.

2657
04:24:38,829 --> 04:24:56,649
I think this is okay to me.

2658
04:24:56,649 --> 04:25:09,129
I really need splash damage.

2659
04:25:09,129 --> 04:25:15,489
I think this is okay.

2660
04:25:15,489 --> 04:25:30,299
That dog's not going to be a problem.

2661
04:25:30,299 --> 04:25:33,170
Yeah.

2662
04:25:33,170 --> 04:25:36,139
When are you going to play Destiny 2 PVP?

2663
04:25:36,139 --> 04:25:38,770
I already did.

2664
04:25:38,770 --> 04:25:43,829
I just deleted the VOD because I was embarrassed about it.

2665
04:25:43,829 --> 04:25:46,790
I just turned off notifications to subs and stuff

2666
04:25:46,790 --> 04:25:50,100
and followers and I just played like three or four hours

2667
04:25:50,100 --> 04:25:51,620
of it and I was just like, I'm not into this.

2668
04:25:51,620 --> 04:25:53,489
I mean, it's all right.

2669
04:25:53,489 --> 04:25:54,569
I just deleted the VOD and shit

2670
04:25:54,569 --> 04:25:57,290
because I don't want anyone to see it.

2671
04:25:57,290 --> 04:25:58,129
I remember that.

2672
04:25:58,129 --> 04:25:59,909
Yeah.

2673
04:25:59,909 --> 04:26:01,940
It was like fucking, yeah.

2674
04:26:01,940 --> 04:26:02,780
Well, I won.

2675
04:26:02,780 --> 04:26:07,690
So we're going to keep the snail frozen.

2676
04:26:07,690 --> 04:26:09,709
Oh, honey on the badger.

2677
04:26:09,709 --> 04:26:11,629
Honey on the badger.

2678
04:26:11,629 --> 04:26:13,399
What am I doing?

2679
04:26:13,399 --> 04:26:14,639
Oh, that stream was so bad.

2680
04:26:14,639 --> 04:26:16,700
It was so sad.

2681
04:26:16,700 --> 04:26:20,139
I know.

2682
04:26:20,139 --> 04:26:28,790
Honey on the badger.

2683
04:26:28,790 --> 04:26:29,629
All right.

2684
04:26:29,629 --> 04:26:38,739
I really, really want a spider or kangaroo upgrade.

2685
04:26:38,739 --> 04:26:39,979
No, no.

2686
04:26:39,979 --> 04:26:40,819
Okay.

2687
04:26:40,819 --> 04:26:41,639
We'll do meat.

2688
04:26:41,639 --> 04:26:51,040
No, we won't.

2689
04:26:51,040 --> 04:26:55,540
The swan.

2690
04:26:55,540 --> 04:26:59,280
Yeah, that's the only thing I can really do.

2691
04:26:59,280 --> 04:27:00,940
Okay.

2692
04:27:00,979 --> 04:27:11,860
Probably going to lose, but I'll get a good next turn.

2693
04:27:11,860 --> 04:27:12,700
It's a phone game.

2694
04:27:12,700 --> 04:27:20,620
It's not a phone game.

2695
04:27:20,620 --> 04:27:28,159
It looks pretty safe.

2696
04:27:28,159 --> 04:27:31,100
Literally a phone game.

2697
04:27:31,100 --> 04:27:34,149
This game is on Steam right now.

2698
04:27:34,149 --> 04:27:36,989
Is Clash of Clans on Steam?

2699
04:27:36,989 --> 04:27:40,250
No.

2700
04:27:40,250 --> 04:27:53,379
That's a phone game.

2701
04:27:53,379 --> 04:27:54,219
I won again.

2702
04:27:54,219 --> 04:27:57,280
Okay.

2703
04:27:57,280 --> 04:28:05,159
Well, we need to roll for some upgrades.

2704
04:28:05,159 --> 04:28:16,860
No.

2705
04:28:16,860 --> 04:28:23,379
This has to replace somebody with who?

2706
04:28:23,379 --> 04:28:26,930
I feel like I need both of these.

2707
04:28:26,930 --> 04:28:36,620
He has, and the rooster has to go in the front.

2708
04:28:36,620 --> 04:28:38,340
I get rid of the cricket.

2709
04:28:38,340 --> 04:28:43,030
I think the, or the spider.

2710
04:28:43,030 --> 04:28:45,389
What gets me more value here?

2711
04:28:45,389 --> 04:28:49,129
The spider, I think.

2712
04:28:49,129 --> 04:28:50,770
Cricket currently does more damage than the spider,

2713
04:28:50,770 --> 04:28:54,489
but the spider makes the kangaroo better.

2714
04:28:54,489 --> 04:29:00,559
And I'm almost about to level them up.

2715
04:29:00,559 --> 04:29:01,399
All right.

2716
04:29:01,399 --> 04:29:09,020
This is bad, but we have to do it.

2717
04:29:19,559 --> 04:29:24,940
Cause then this will get really, really good.

2718
04:29:24,940 --> 04:29:28,440
I wonder if I can, should I move the?

2719
04:29:28,440 --> 04:29:29,540
No, I think it stays there.

2720
04:29:29,540 --> 04:29:33,729
But the swan might move.

2721
04:29:33,729 --> 04:29:34,569
Hold on.

2722
04:29:34,569 --> 04:29:35,969
Let's just see what we get here.

2723
04:29:35,969 --> 04:29:36,979
Right?

2724
04:29:36,979 --> 04:29:41,780
I have a roll and I'm not going to buy any of these.

2725
04:29:41,780 --> 04:29:42,940
So let's say, you know what I mean?

2726
04:29:42,940 --> 04:29:43,780
Let's just roll.

2727
04:29:43,780 --> 04:29:51,440
Let's see if we get something good.

2728
04:29:51,440 --> 04:29:52,280
All right.

2729
04:29:52,280 --> 04:29:56,459
That's, this is going here.

2730
04:29:56,459 --> 04:29:58,250
Okay.

2731
04:29:58,250 --> 04:30:09,180
This is big.

2732
04:30:09,819 --> 04:30:10,659
Okay.

2733
04:30:10,659 --> 04:30:11,739
Take a look at this shit.

2734
04:30:11,739 --> 04:30:14,659
Perfect.

2735
04:30:14,659 --> 04:30:15,500
Roll again.

2736
04:30:15,500 --> 04:30:16,959
Okay.

2737
04:30:16,959 --> 04:30:17,780
All right.

2738
04:30:17,780 --> 04:30:18,620
Okay.

2739
04:30:18,620 --> 04:30:19,459
I just have to survive to another turn.

2740
04:30:19,459 --> 04:30:20,280
And this is big.

2741
04:30:20,280 --> 04:30:23,350
This is bingo.

2742
04:30:23,350 --> 04:30:24,770
Even if I lose, I can't sell anything.

2743
04:30:24,770 --> 04:30:27,459
I don't think this snow might have to go.

2744
04:30:27,459 --> 04:30:43,750
Find out.

2745
04:30:43,750 --> 04:30:48,299
At least get rid of the elephant.

2746
04:30:48,299 --> 04:30:51,719
That hippo is really dangerous.

2747
04:30:51,719 --> 04:31:01,770
Swan should kill not both of them, but it's all right.

2748
04:31:01,770 --> 04:31:06,950
Ooh.

2749
04:31:06,950 --> 04:31:09,370
Scary.

2750
04:31:09,370 --> 04:31:10,469
I think I had the melon armor.

2751
04:31:10,469 --> 04:31:11,790
That would have been very scary.

2752
04:31:11,790 --> 04:31:12,629
Oh!

2753
04:31:12,629 --> 04:31:14,479
What happened?

2754
04:31:14,479 --> 04:31:17,719
What?

2755
04:31:17,719 --> 04:31:20,190
What the hell?

2756
04:31:20,229 --> 04:31:21,069
Oh man.

2757
04:31:21,069 --> 04:31:21,909
That sucked.

2758
04:31:21,909 --> 04:31:23,780
Oh, come on.

2759
04:31:23,780 --> 04:31:25,780
Oh, but look at what it gave me.

2760
04:31:25,780 --> 04:31:27,430
It gave me triple.

2761
04:31:27,430 --> 04:31:28,250
All right.

2762
04:31:28,250 --> 04:31:31,059
Oh shit.

2763
04:31:31,059 --> 04:31:36,780
So I think the play is sell the swan,

2764
04:31:36,780 --> 04:31:41,139
get rid of the swan, upgrade the monkey,

2765
04:31:41,139 --> 04:31:45,180
put the snail up, sell the snail for the sheep.

2766
04:31:45,180 --> 04:31:53,690
Maybe.

2767
04:31:53,690 --> 04:31:55,069
Well, I know I'm doing this.

2768
04:31:55,069 --> 04:31:57,229
This is certain.

2769
04:31:57,229 --> 04:32:00,610
Like this is just certainty.

2770
04:32:00,610 --> 04:32:06,559
So just do it.

2771
04:32:06,559 --> 04:32:07,659
Four, four.

2772
04:32:07,659 --> 04:32:08,639
Gorilla in front.

2773
04:32:08,639 --> 04:32:09,479
Four, four.

2774
04:32:09,479 --> 04:32:24,399
Get rid of the swan.

2775
04:32:24,399 --> 04:32:25,239
Okay.

2776
04:32:26,510 --> 04:32:31,219
Gorilla's going in the front, but not yet.

2777
04:32:31,219 --> 04:32:36,520
Come on.

2778
04:32:36,520 --> 04:32:41,680
Okay.

2779
04:32:41,680 --> 04:32:49,930
Let's go.

2780
04:32:49,930 --> 04:32:56,879
This should be a winning hand.

2781
04:32:56,879 --> 04:33:05,360
Would have been awesome to get another gorilla.

2782
04:33:05,360 --> 04:33:06,840
I like the way this is set up.

2783
04:33:06,840 --> 04:33:13,750
Hopefully it works out.

2784
04:33:13,750 --> 04:33:16,990
12, 12 gorilla with the coconut shield.

2785
04:33:16,990 --> 04:33:19,950
It has to activate it though, which is scary.

2786
04:33:19,950 --> 04:33:20,790
Okay.

2787
04:33:20,790 --> 04:33:27,310
I will.

2788
04:33:27,310 --> 04:33:28,130
Took off the melon armor.

2789
04:33:28,130 --> 04:33:34,119
Oh, you son of a gun.

2790
04:33:34,119 --> 04:33:46,360
Oh, you son of a gun.

2791
04:33:46,360 --> 04:33:47,419
We recorded stream.

2792
04:33:47,419 --> 04:33:57,779
Sag.

2793
04:33:57,779 --> 04:34:00,200
Okay.

2794
04:34:00,200 --> 04:34:02,220
Oh!

2795
04:34:05,409 --> 04:34:16,490
But wait.

2796
04:34:16,529 --> 04:34:20,560
I don't know what to do at this point.

2797
04:34:20,560 --> 04:34:31,650
I can upgrade gorilla and then feed gorilla.

2798
04:34:31,650 --> 04:34:35,669
The spider sucks.

2799
04:34:35,669 --> 04:34:36,830
Put in two.

2800
04:34:36,830 --> 04:34:40,900
Okay.

2801
04:34:40,900 --> 04:34:44,580
Is it time to get rid of the kangaroo or the spider?

2802
04:34:44,580 --> 04:34:46,439
Because the kangaroo is really awful

2803
04:34:46,439 --> 04:34:54,900
without the spider in front of them.

2804
04:34:54,900 --> 04:34:56,220
Kangaroo is better with the spider.

2805
04:34:56,220 --> 04:34:57,060
Okay.

2806
04:34:57,060 --> 04:34:58,779
So what's better though,

2807
04:34:58,779 --> 04:35:04,520
is this is just a free 22 damage, right?

2808
04:35:04,520 --> 04:35:10,040
But the rooster in front of the kangaroo.

2809
04:35:10,040 --> 04:35:11,720
So that works still.

2810
04:35:11,720 --> 04:35:15,799
Sell the spider, upgrade the gorilla

2811
04:35:15,799 --> 04:35:22,880
and have double monkey.

2812
04:35:22,880 --> 04:35:25,119
Like you're talking two slots, right?

2813
04:35:25,119 --> 04:35:29,659
So the gorilla gets a six, six.

2814
04:35:29,659 --> 04:35:31,060
All right, we're going for it.

2815
04:35:31,060 --> 04:35:34,889
That's cool.

2816
04:35:34,889 --> 04:35:36,310
So this is gonna go here

2817
04:35:38,599 --> 04:35:47,270
and then upgrade the gorilla and then feed the gorilla.

2818
04:35:47,270 --> 04:35:48,470
All right, let's go.

2819
04:35:48,470 --> 04:35:53,720
This is gonna be a huge deal.

2820
04:35:53,720 --> 04:35:58,439
All right, let's do it.

2821
04:35:58,439 --> 04:36:02,900
21, 21.

2822
04:36:02,900 --> 04:36:05,389
That's a big boy.

2823
04:36:05,389 --> 04:36:07,709
Oh, but that's an even, that's a bigger one.

2824
04:36:07,709 --> 04:36:09,799
That one's bigger though.

2825
04:36:09,799 --> 04:36:13,810
Oh God, that's not good.

2826
04:36:13,810 --> 04:36:16,970
I think I still do it though.

2827
04:36:16,970 --> 04:36:22,919
Cause this is the strongest thing he has.

2828
04:36:22,919 --> 04:36:25,189
Is it okay?

2829
04:36:25,189 --> 04:36:26,610
No, it's not.

2830
04:36:26,610 --> 04:36:30,189
Aye.

2831
04:36:30,189 --> 04:36:32,139
It's all right.

2832
04:36:32,139 --> 04:36:33,220
No, it's not all right.

2833
04:36:33,220 --> 04:36:34,040
That's loud.

2834
04:36:34,040 --> 04:36:53,159
I wanted to get an upgraded gorilla so bad.

2835
04:36:53,159 --> 04:36:54,799
I don't want the fever.

2836
04:36:54,799 --> 04:37:02,659
Thank you.

2837
04:37:02,659 --> 04:37:07,150
How about the flooded ears?

2838
04:37:07,150 --> 04:37:08,290
This is it.

2839
04:37:08,290 --> 04:37:10,250
Yo, I'm streaming again on Sunday.

2840
04:37:10,250 --> 04:37:13,250
I'll be back.

2841
04:37:13,250 --> 04:37:34,270
This is too fun.

2842
04:37:34,270 --> 04:37:36,740
What about Friday?

2843
04:37:36,740 --> 04:37:38,720
Oh yeah, maybe it is Friday.

2844
04:37:38,720 --> 04:37:46,689
I'll figure it out.

2845
04:37:46,689 --> 04:37:48,470
I gotta talk to italics cause we're gonna play,

2846
04:37:48,470 --> 04:37:50,180
we're gonna play Resident Evil 6.

2847
04:37:50,180 --> 04:37:52,020
So it's either gonna be Friday or Sunday.

2848
04:37:52,020 --> 04:38:15,599
But we'll look out for Sunday.

2849
04:38:15,599 --> 04:38:21,349
All right, next turn, selling both ducks.

2850
04:38:22,069 --> 04:38:37,909
And I'm gonna try to replace the two ducks.

2851
04:38:37,909 --> 04:38:39,130
Is this a win?

2852
04:38:39,130 --> 04:38:51,099
Five, three.

2853
04:38:51,099 --> 04:38:52,419
I've ever played six before?

2854
04:38:52,419 --> 04:38:57,299
For about 30 minutes.

2855
04:39:09,259 --> 04:39:11,659
Okay, here's the, oh no, this sucks.

2856
04:39:11,659 --> 04:39:19,240
I screwed, okay, I need to do,

2857
04:39:19,240 --> 04:39:25,189
should I just do a weirdo porcupine build?

2858
04:39:25,189 --> 04:39:26,900
Yeah, let's go.

2859
04:39:26,900 --> 04:39:28,819
Watch this.

2860
04:39:28,819 --> 04:39:39,680
Okay, sell, give shop pets one, one.

2861
04:39:39,680 --> 04:39:51,639
Okay, all right.

2862
04:39:51,639 --> 04:39:56,599
Then I'm gonna roll.

2863
04:39:56,599 --> 04:40:00,299
Oh hell yeah.

2864
04:40:00,299 --> 04:40:12,290
All right, sell the beaver

2865
04:40:12,290 --> 04:40:32,189
and then put another hedgehog up here.

2866
04:40:33,110 --> 04:40:37,770
And then combine the fish.

2867
04:40:37,770 --> 04:40:39,909
Take a look at that.

2868
04:40:39,909 --> 04:40:42,639
Wowee.

2869
04:40:42,639 --> 04:40:52,150
I want that turtle.

2870
04:40:52,150 --> 04:41:04,669
Oh wait, they have to die.

2871
04:41:04,669 --> 04:41:15,090
So they have to die for that to trigger.

2872
04:41:15,090 --> 04:41:19,880
This is a win because this is guaranteed.

2873
04:41:19,880 --> 04:41:25,180
I'm guaranteed to win.

2874
04:41:25,180 --> 04:41:28,049
Cause even if they die, they will kill.

2875
04:41:28,049 --> 04:41:32,529
All right, interesting.

2876
04:41:32,529 --> 04:41:46,650
Maybe I should combine them.

2877
04:41:46,650 --> 04:41:53,209
Yeah, this has to be in the front cause that will die.

2878
04:41:53,209 --> 04:42:01,529
And then do I, I could just make one

2879
04:42:01,529 --> 04:42:11,909
that does four damage to everybody.

2880
04:42:11,909 --> 04:42:14,110
DLC pack, yeah, I switched it to the normal pack

2881
04:42:14,110 --> 04:42:17,360
because we were playing on the normal pack

2882
04:42:17,959 --> 04:42:19,080
and I accidentally switched the expansion one

2883
04:42:19,080 --> 04:42:22,540
and I didn't, I never switched back.

2884
04:42:22,540 --> 04:42:25,159
They're just gonna kill the fish.

2885
04:42:25,159 --> 04:42:27,330
That's true.

2886
04:42:27,330 --> 04:42:32,849
So why don't we do this?

2887
04:42:32,849 --> 04:42:55,330
And then this will just play out.

2888
04:42:55,330 --> 04:43:05,139
All right, what if Peacock the hedgehog?

2889
04:43:05,139 --> 04:43:06,259
They do too much damage.

2890
04:43:06,259 --> 04:43:13,169
They'll just kill it.

2891
04:43:13,169 --> 04:43:15,250
It does two damage, Peacock has five, right?

2892
04:43:15,250 --> 04:43:22,090
They'll just kill it.

2893
04:43:22,090 --> 04:43:23,169
All right, how bad is this gonna go?

2894
04:43:23,169 --> 04:43:26,659
We'll find out.

2895
04:43:26,659 --> 04:43:31,279
Okay, ow, shit.

2896
04:43:31,279 --> 04:43:48,400
Hey, it's not a loss.

2897
04:43:48,400 --> 04:43:53,759
Okay, this is give everybody two, two.

2898
04:43:53,759 --> 04:43:55,119
Do I just build for that?

2899
04:43:55,119 --> 04:44:11,970
Yeah, let's do it, who cares?

2900
04:44:11,970 --> 04:44:15,740
What's wrong?

2901
04:44:15,740 --> 04:44:20,080
Move the turtle?

2902
04:44:20,080 --> 04:44:36,840
Well, this is a disaster for this guy.

2903
04:44:36,840 --> 04:44:38,880
Here we go.

2904
04:44:38,880 --> 04:44:43,419
Oh, kill it all.

2905
04:44:43,419 --> 04:44:47,000
Okay, oh, hell yeah.

2906
04:44:47,000 --> 04:45:00,200
Everybody loses.

2907
04:45:00,200 --> 04:45:04,020
So I guess you have to, you garlic the hedgehogs.

2908
04:45:04,020 --> 04:45:17,840
That sounds like a shitty new Sonic character

2909
04:45:17,840 --> 04:45:29,990
because they'll only take one damage now from this.

2910
04:45:29,990 --> 04:45:36,529
I want a fish, bad, really bad, please.

2911
04:45:36,529 --> 04:45:39,799
No, oh, shit.

2912
04:45:39,799 --> 04:45:59,909
No, fish, move the turtle?

2913
04:45:59,909 --> 04:46:04,439
I like the fact that this does damage with the,

2914
04:46:04,439 --> 04:46:05,919
oh no, you're right, you're right,

2915
04:46:05,919 --> 04:46:07,520
because you can only have one buff at a time.

2916
04:46:07,520 --> 04:46:11,279
You're right, you're right, okay.

2917
04:46:11,279 --> 04:46:15,770
It'll work out though, it's fine.

2918
04:46:15,770 --> 04:46:22,240
Now it's over, check this out.

2919
04:46:22,240 --> 04:46:32,889
Yep, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful.

2920
04:46:32,889 --> 04:47:02,459
Nobody gets to win, draws only, oh no.

2921
04:47:02,459 --> 04:47:09,290
God damn it, okay, well, what does this do now?

2922
04:47:09,290 --> 04:47:14,919
Just four damage to everybody?

2923
04:47:14,919 --> 04:47:22,090
How am I gonna, this is gonna be fucking horrible.

2924
04:47:22,090 --> 04:47:29,500
I'm just gonna lose.

2925
04:47:30,500 --> 04:47:33,689
Why the front one?

2926
04:47:33,689 --> 04:47:34,840
This one needs to go all the way to the back.

2927
04:47:34,840 --> 04:47:41,639
Do not do that, how do I move this to the back?

2928
04:47:41,639 --> 04:47:55,319
How do I move this without it combining?

2929
04:47:55,319 --> 04:48:08,610
Very good, so I'm gonna do this, that makes sense.

2930
04:48:08,610 --> 04:48:22,939
I don't have any money for garlic.

2931
04:48:22,939 --> 04:48:25,220
This is a huge pain in the ass for anybody that fights me

2932
04:48:25,220 --> 04:48:30,240
even though it's not that great.

2933
04:48:30,240 --> 04:48:39,599
This is a huge pain in the ass.

2934
04:48:39,599 --> 04:48:47,849
Okay, that's fine, all right, again.

2935
04:48:47,849 --> 04:48:50,959
Oh shit, come on, turtle, turtle, I need the turtle.

2936
04:48:50,959 --> 04:49:13,520
Nice, very good, okay, oh, come on.

2937
04:49:13,520 --> 04:49:21,319
Wait, before I do anything stupid,

2938
04:49:21,319 --> 04:49:41,229
level two turtle will give two armors.

2939
04:49:41,229 --> 04:49:44,130
That doesn't really help me in this stupid build.

2940
04:49:44,130 --> 04:49:46,189
All right, here's what I'm gonna do.

2941
04:49:46,189 --> 04:49:49,799
I think I'm gonna combine hedgehogs

2942
04:49:49,799 --> 04:50:01,259
and have two level two hedgehogs

2943
04:50:01,259 --> 04:50:05,299
because that's probably better.

2944
04:50:05,299 --> 04:50:12,360
Don't do it yet, do it in one more turn.

2945
04:50:15,580 --> 04:50:19,130
They'll kill you, you need honey.

2946
04:50:19,130 --> 04:50:20,729
I actually do need honey, you're right,

2947
04:50:20,729 --> 04:50:25,939
because they're gonna kill everybody.

2948
04:50:25,939 --> 04:50:27,040
I need to roll for honey.

2949
04:50:27,040 --> 04:50:32,680
The monkey's cool, but not for this build.

2950
04:50:32,680 --> 04:50:37,709
Oh, wait a second, wait a second.

2951
04:50:37,709 --> 04:50:49,830
Excuse me, that's a big deal.

2952
04:50:49,990 --> 04:51:03,599
Oh shit, okay, are we ready?

2953
04:51:03,599 --> 04:51:06,310
I think we're ready.

2954
04:51:06,310 --> 04:51:09,490
Oh, should the turtle go in the front to hit?

2955
04:51:09,490 --> 04:51:15,299
Who should the turtle give it to?

2956
04:51:15,299 --> 04:51:20,400
Ellen will cancel the garlic, so I need to give it to you.

2957
04:51:20,400 --> 04:51:27,619
I want the fish to be in the back.

2958
04:51:27,619 --> 04:51:41,150
The fish is gonna die, I think that's all right.

2959
04:51:41,150 --> 04:51:50,470
All right, let's go.

2960
04:51:50,470 --> 04:51:54,200
Can you do the Elmo voice?

2961
04:51:54,200 --> 04:51:57,599
Hello, hi Mr. Noodle.

2962
04:51:57,599 --> 04:52:07,479
I woke up too early, I can't do it.

2963
04:52:07,479 --> 04:52:12,680
Kill this guy in the front.

2964
04:52:12,680 --> 04:52:22,529
I hit Melanon, oh, it's 20 damage, no.

2965
04:52:22,529 --> 04:52:31,459
It only blocks 20, that's right.

2966
04:52:31,500 --> 04:52:33,020
All right, this shithead build

2967
04:52:33,020 --> 04:52:41,119
is not working out very well.

2968
04:52:41,119 --> 04:52:55,779
I could just do two level two hedgehogs.

2969
04:52:55,779 --> 04:53:01,020
What is that?

2970
04:53:01,020 --> 04:53:10,470
Oh, Douglas, it's me, Mr. Dink.

2971
04:53:10,490 --> 04:53:21,830
That's definitely going on, one of these guys.

2972
04:53:33,919 --> 04:53:38,950
End the stream now, no.

2973
04:53:38,950 --> 04:53:40,790
This is just so stupid, it's gonna do eight damage

2974
04:53:40,790 --> 04:53:41,790
and kill everybody, who cares?

2975
04:53:41,790 --> 04:53:53,909
It's funny, this is the last one anyways.

2976
04:53:53,909 --> 04:53:58,200
It should be like this.

2977
04:53:58,200 --> 04:54:04,979
I do have a reroll, that's right.

2978
04:54:04,979 --> 04:54:06,700
Not enough to do anything interesting.

2979
04:54:06,700 --> 04:54:11,720
I'm gonna garlic, who do I do?

2980
04:54:11,759 --> 04:54:15,180
Maybe just health on the turtle or something.

2981
04:54:15,180 --> 04:54:18,159
Health on the tiger so he stays alive long enough

2982
04:54:18,159 --> 04:54:24,119
to at least have this happen once.

2983
04:54:24,119 --> 04:54:32,080
Or garlic on the tiger, otherwise he'll just die.

2984
04:54:32,080 --> 04:54:35,770
But then he'll take two from that, all right.

2985
04:54:35,770 --> 04:54:38,069
Well, this is gonna be stupid.

2986
04:54:38,069 --> 04:54:42,150
I get to do this one more time.

2987
04:54:42,150 --> 04:54:58,819
Wap the hedgehogs, all right, let's go.

2988
04:54:58,819 --> 04:55:05,759
No, the German tiger will die.

2989
04:55:05,759 --> 04:55:07,360
Can you combine it for a level three?

2990
04:55:07,360 --> 04:55:09,970
Do two level twos turn into a level three?

2991
04:55:09,970 --> 04:55:14,860
I don't know, I'm unaware of how that works.

2992
04:55:14,860 --> 04:55:18,919
I mean, if it goes off, it kills everybody.

2993
04:55:18,919 --> 04:55:29,479
Literally everybody dies.

2994
04:55:29,479 --> 04:55:32,340
Oh man, it's gonna happen.

2995
04:55:32,340 --> 04:55:36,330
Yeah, that's it.

2996
04:55:36,330 --> 04:55:43,090
No, stupid boss, oh shit.

2997
04:55:43,090 --> 04:55:46,169
All right, okay, please confirm with me.

2998
04:55:46,169 --> 04:55:48,650
If I combine these two, does it make a level three?

2999
04:55:48,650 --> 04:55:50,689
Because doing six damage,

3000
04:55:50,689 --> 04:55:59,180
doing 12 damage to everyone is kind of funny.

3001
04:55:59,180 --> 04:56:08,700
I didn't get a, oh, this is gonna do six damage to everybody.

3002
04:56:08,700 --> 04:56:24,759
I have to keep the tiger alive.

3003
04:56:24,759 --> 04:56:28,330
12 with tiger, yeah, this is gonna be insane.

3004
04:56:28,330 --> 04:56:29,169
Do another one?

3005
04:56:29,169 --> 04:56:33,119
No, I don't think I want to.

3006
04:56:33,119 --> 04:56:34,479
All right, I gotta roll for like a melon

3007
04:56:34,479 --> 04:56:36,490
or something for the tiger, yeah.

3008
04:56:36,849 --> 04:56:47,330
I need something else just to stand in the way.

3009
04:56:47,330 --> 04:56:50,189
This has to hit two people.

3010
04:56:50,189 --> 04:56:56,599
Put the turtle in front of the hog

3011
04:56:56,599 --> 04:57:00,389
so it'll protect the both of them, I guess, I don't know.

3012
04:57:00,389 --> 04:57:08,650
Puffer fish could be interesting, really late for it.

3013
04:57:08,650 --> 04:57:12,150
It's just too late for it.

3014
04:57:12,150 --> 04:57:21,650
Hog two is dumb, all right.

3015
04:57:21,650 --> 04:57:31,110
I mean, it's just, I could buff up the tiger.

3016
04:57:31,110 --> 04:57:35,840
Do the rooster, they just die.

3017
04:57:35,840 --> 04:57:40,779
And rooster in the back.

3018
04:57:40,779 --> 04:57:43,180
I don't think the rooster's gonna survive.

3019
04:57:43,180 --> 04:57:46,250
It's 12 damage, guys.

3020
04:57:46,250 --> 04:57:52,830
If this thing goes, everyone goes.

3021
04:57:53,549 --> 04:57:54,389
Oh, we're hoping for worries.

3022
04:57:54,389 --> 04:57:56,549
It kills everything and then the chick pops up.

3023
04:57:56,549 --> 04:57:59,409
Okay, right, that makes sense.

3024
04:57:59,409 --> 04:58:03,610
Well, how is this for placement?

3025
04:58:03,610 --> 04:58:04,650
I think that's as good as it's gonna get.

3026
04:58:04,650 --> 04:58:10,680
This is stupid.

3027
04:58:10,680 --> 04:58:13,040
Is this stupid enough to just ruin everybody's game

3028
04:58:13,040 --> 04:58:18,180
and have me win games?

3029
04:58:18,180 --> 04:58:25,020
Make sure the rooster's in front of the turtle.

3030
04:58:25,020 --> 04:58:29,090
I know, I want him to die after this.

3031
04:58:29,090 --> 04:58:30,169
We'll see.

3032
04:58:30,169 --> 04:58:34,970
No, I think this is fine like this.

3033
04:58:34,970 --> 04:58:37,389
Rooster needs to be last, yeah.

3034
04:58:37,389 --> 04:58:40,520
This is fine.

3035
04:58:40,520 --> 04:58:46,729
Here we go, good luck.

3036
04:58:46,729 --> 04:58:52,790
Let's see how this works.

3037
04:58:52,830 --> 04:58:59,509
Okay, well, this is gonna be an interesting scenario.

3038
04:58:59,509 --> 04:59:05,659
Okay, fine, 12 damage.

3039
04:59:05,659 --> 04:59:08,090
Oh no, come on.

3040
04:59:08,090 --> 04:59:13,360
Oh shit, oh shit.

3041
04:59:13,360 --> 04:59:17,150
Did I win?

3042
04:59:17,150 --> 04:59:18,549
Oh, you have a dumb ass porcupine.

3043
04:59:18,549 --> 04:59:34,880
Okay, we're good.

3044
04:59:34,880 --> 04:59:35,720
What's the deal here?

3045
04:59:35,720 --> 04:59:46,639
Do I just keep giving food to the rooster?

3046
04:59:46,639 --> 04:59:56,669
Just keep buffing the chicken like crazy?

3047
04:59:56,669 --> 04:59:58,970
Rooster needs honey.

3048
04:59:58,970 --> 05:00:10,060
Yeah, yeah, we need to roll for either another rooster.

3049
05:00:10,060 --> 05:00:13,169
Cat is better than the fish.

3050
05:00:13,169 --> 05:00:16,889
It is, okay.

3051
05:00:16,930 --> 05:00:20,840
The fish just has garlic on it.

3052
05:00:20,840 --> 05:00:22,959
So we can put cat instead of fish

3053
05:00:22,959 --> 05:00:25,200
and then feed the cat a bunch.

3054
05:00:25,200 --> 05:00:27,490
Does the cat get the benefit from this?

3055
05:00:27,490 --> 05:00:29,650
We have all current and future shop heads too too.

3056
05:00:29,650 --> 05:00:36,630
Does that mean he's a 4-4?

3057
05:00:36,630 --> 05:00:38,990
And before cat, you can feed anything.

3058
05:00:38,990 --> 05:00:44,319
Okay, so that should be 4-4 added.

3059
05:00:44,319 --> 05:00:45,680
Well, that was wrong apparently

3060
05:00:45,680 --> 05:00:51,810
because that's only a 10-11.

3061
05:00:51,810 --> 05:00:53,209
It has to be purchased first.

3062
05:00:53,209 --> 05:00:59,020
Well, we know we're doing this.

3063
05:00:59,020 --> 05:01:01,639
That's so cute.

3064
05:01:01,639 --> 05:01:08,580
Steak, all right, it's like this is six-six.

3065
05:01:08,580 --> 05:01:15,560
Do this and make the cat a 16-17?

3066
05:01:15,560 --> 05:01:22,580
Or do I cupcake the rooster instead

3067
05:01:22,580 --> 05:01:27,970
to make sure that there'll be at least 11 or 12 damage?

3068
05:01:27,970 --> 05:01:31,599
Do the cow instead of who?

3069
05:01:31,599 --> 05:01:35,159
Who do I get rid of?

3070
05:01:35,159 --> 05:01:36,520
I mean, freeze the cow is a good idea,

3071
05:01:36,520 --> 05:01:40,959
but remember, this is over if I die.

3072
05:01:40,959 --> 05:01:45,450
Get rid of the turtle at this point

3073
05:01:45,450 --> 05:01:47,610
and just buy the food from the cow

3074
05:01:47,610 --> 05:01:49,680
and just give it to the cat twice.

3075
05:01:49,680 --> 05:02:01,599
So it'll be like a 20-20.

3076
05:02:01,599 --> 05:02:04,689
Ludwig is stealing your strats.

3077
05:02:04,689 --> 05:02:09,630
I think we feed, yeah, I think we get rid of the turtle.

3078
05:02:09,630 --> 05:02:13,080
We either give it to the cat

3079
05:02:13,080 --> 05:02:19,810
or just stuff the rooster full of milk.

3080
05:02:19,810 --> 05:02:21,259
Well, let's do it.

3081
05:02:21,259 --> 05:02:23,169
Let's go for it.

3082
05:02:23,169 --> 05:02:30,279
Okay, cow coming in.

3083
05:02:30,279 --> 05:02:32,000
Cupcake, wait, cupcake.

3084
05:02:32,000 --> 05:02:33,959
Cupcake to rooster?

3085
05:02:33,959 --> 05:02:35,099
No, what do I do?

3086
05:02:35,099 --> 05:02:38,060
Cupcake to cat and then all milk to cat.

3087
05:02:38,060 --> 05:02:43,180
This would be like a 30-30

3088
05:02:43,180 --> 05:02:46,819
because it clears the items.

3089
05:02:46,819 --> 05:02:50,150
Cupcake to cat, that means 16-17.

3090
05:02:50,150 --> 05:02:52,470
Two milks is eight-eight.

3091
05:02:52,470 --> 05:02:55,509
17 plus eight is like 25 or something.

3092
05:02:55,509 --> 05:02:58,500
And it's not gonna be like, that's gonna be like 25-25.

3093
05:02:58,500 --> 05:03:00,659
It's free, the milk is free.

3094
05:03:00,659 --> 05:03:01,500
I don't have enough money.

3095
05:03:01,500 --> 05:03:05,360
Oh, okay.

3096
05:03:05,360 --> 05:03:07,950
All right, so what I'm doing is I'm putting the cow up.

3097
05:03:07,950 --> 05:03:12,250
Cow's gonna get the milk.

3098
05:03:12,250 --> 05:03:14,250
Milk is going to the cat or to the rooster?

3099
05:03:14,250 --> 05:03:16,740
Probably the rooster, right?

3100
05:03:16,740 --> 05:03:17,900
And then the cow is just gonna die.

3101
05:03:17,900 --> 05:03:22,139
Everyone's gonna die, who cares?

3102
05:03:22,139 --> 05:03:22,979
Cat or rooster?

3103
05:03:22,979 --> 05:03:24,700
I think the safe play is rooster

3104
05:03:24,700 --> 05:03:26,259
because then he'll come back with another,

3105
05:03:26,259 --> 05:03:28,439
be able to kill it.

3106
05:03:28,439 --> 05:03:30,040
I mean, we'll have a really beefy cat,

3107
05:03:30,040 --> 05:03:35,310
but I don't know if that's good enough.

3108
05:03:35,310 --> 05:03:36,549
Boost the rooster.

3109
05:03:36,549 --> 05:03:40,569
That'd be four-four or eight-eight to the cat.

3110
05:03:40,569 --> 05:03:47,659
I don't know, I kind of want to see it to the cat.

3111
05:03:47,659 --> 05:03:49,849
But hold on, here's the thing.

3112
05:03:49,889 --> 05:03:51,709
If I give it to the rooster,

3113
05:03:51,709 --> 05:03:55,610
the rooster will survive the apocalypse

3114
05:03:55,610 --> 05:04:00,139
because this is 12 damage.

3115
05:04:00,139 --> 05:04:05,270
I think it has to be the rooster.

3116
05:04:05,270 --> 05:04:09,229
Yeah, it has to be.

3117
05:04:09,229 --> 05:04:17,840
The rooster now survives the apocalypse.

3118
05:04:17,840 --> 05:04:22,599
In fact, I'm doing it again.

3119
05:04:22,599 --> 05:04:24,700
Here we go.

3120
05:04:24,700 --> 05:04:27,439
Last chance, let's just roll.

3121
05:04:27,439 --> 05:04:29,400
Oh, and you're gonna show me your chocolate right now?

3122
05:04:29,400 --> 05:04:38,520
Is that what you're gonna do, really?

3123
05:04:38,520 --> 05:04:43,659
Well, fuck it, here we go.

3124
05:04:43,659 --> 05:04:50,500
Curious.

3125
05:04:50,500 --> 05:04:52,020
Look at all these, oh, you got a level,

3126
05:04:52,020 --> 05:04:57,310
17, 19 damage, 19 health, that's fine.

3127
05:04:57,310 --> 05:05:01,110
No one's surviving the apocalypse.

3128
05:05:01,110 --> 05:05:04,639
Oh, fuck, this is not good.

3129
05:05:04,639 --> 05:05:07,060
It is good, I win.

3130
05:05:07,060 --> 05:05:10,540
Do I win or is it a draw?

3131
05:05:10,540 --> 05:05:15,919
Oh, it's a draw.

3132
05:05:15,919 --> 05:05:19,319
Oh, well, this looks so bad, but this is fun.

3133
05:05:19,319 --> 05:05:26,599
Okay, damn it.

3134
05:05:26,599 --> 05:05:30,020
This is, I win every game now.

3135
05:05:30,020 --> 05:05:31,259
I win every game.

3136
05:05:31,259 --> 05:05:34,689
There's no way I lose another game after this.

3137
05:05:34,689 --> 05:05:36,729
Mushroom on the rooster is,

3138
05:05:36,729 --> 05:05:39,290
I've guaranteed to win every single game

3139
05:05:39,290 --> 05:05:47,860
no matter what happens.

3140
05:05:47,860 --> 05:05:50,900
Wait a minute, should it be on the hedgehog?

3141
05:05:50,900 --> 05:05:51,860
Because then the hedgehog would come back

3142
05:05:51,860 --> 05:05:58,360
and do 12, six damage again?

3143
05:05:58,360 --> 05:05:59,720
Does it come back as a level one?

3144
05:05:59,720 --> 05:06:02,080
No, it just comes back as a one, one.

3145
05:06:02,080 --> 05:06:09,110
Okay, so that would be bad.

3146
05:06:09,110 --> 05:06:11,250
Chocolate the cat.

3147
05:06:11,250 --> 05:06:13,470
One up the hedgehog.

3148
05:06:13,470 --> 05:06:14,590
It would still be level three,

3149
05:06:14,590 --> 05:06:17,860
so nobody will ever win.

3150
05:06:17,860 --> 05:06:19,639
This would be horrible.

3151
05:06:19,639 --> 05:06:23,909
Just do it for the nuke build.

3152
05:06:23,909 --> 05:06:30,869
That's 18 damage.

3153
05:06:32,150 --> 05:06:39,540
Somebody said feed the chocolate to the cat, okay?

3154
05:06:39,540 --> 05:06:40,540
Do it to the rooster.

3155
05:06:40,540 --> 05:06:45,770
Do it with, yeah, I need to make sure there's no survivors.

3156
05:06:45,770 --> 05:06:47,450
Chocolate the rooster.

3157
05:06:47,450 --> 05:06:50,049
Wait, so this is not just for the cat,

3158
05:06:50,049 --> 05:06:51,650
this is for everybody up here.

3159
05:06:51,650 --> 05:06:53,650
So if I give it to the rooster,

3160
05:06:53,650 --> 05:06:55,520
it'll be level two, rooster.

3161
05:06:55,520 --> 05:06:57,880
And the rooster will make two.

3162
05:06:57,880 --> 05:07:00,790
Oh my God.

3163
05:07:00,790 --> 05:07:03,279
Oh my God, that's good.

3164
05:07:03,279 --> 05:07:05,990
That's, no one will ever win.

3165
05:07:05,990 --> 05:07:08,400
I win every game.

3166
05:07:08,400 --> 05:07:09,220
Don't do it?

3167
05:07:09,220 --> 05:07:10,060
No, no, no, don't do it.

3168
05:07:10,060 --> 05:07:11,599
Only works for one?

3169
05:07:11,599 --> 05:07:14,659
It doesn't affect chocolate?

3170
05:07:14,659 --> 05:07:16,259
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

3171
05:07:16,259 --> 05:07:17,080
Roll first.

3172
05:07:17,080 --> 05:07:17,919
Wait, what do you mean?

3173
05:07:17,919 --> 05:07:18,740
It doesn't work?

3174
05:07:18,740 --> 05:07:21,520
It's health and attack only.

3175
05:07:21,520 --> 05:07:24,479
Oh.

3176
05:07:24,479 --> 05:07:27,000
All right, well, I'm giving the mushroom to the hedgehog

3177
05:07:27,000 --> 05:07:29,750
because who cares?

3178
05:07:29,750 --> 05:07:31,580
It's over.

3179
05:07:31,580 --> 05:07:36,259
Who gives a shit?

3180
05:07:36,259 --> 05:07:45,279
So now I'm looking for another cow.

3181
05:07:45,279 --> 05:07:46,400
Does fly help me?

3182
05:07:46,400 --> 05:07:47,599
I don't think so.

3183
05:07:47,599 --> 05:07:50,770
Not at this stage.

3184
05:07:50,770 --> 05:07:58,970
Unless I put him behind the rooster.

3185
05:07:58,970 --> 05:07:59,930
Sushi's not bad here.

3186
05:07:59,930 --> 05:08:07,840
No, just use the sushi.

3187
05:08:07,840 --> 05:08:08,759
Fly is just gonna die.

3188
05:08:08,759 --> 05:08:14,119
That's true.

3189
05:08:14,119 --> 05:08:21,490
I would love another cow.

3190
05:08:21,490 --> 05:08:26,560
Sell cow and get the bison.

3191
05:08:26,560 --> 05:08:29,479
Yeah, that's not a bad idea either.

3192
05:08:29,479 --> 05:08:36,560
Do two every time.

3193
05:08:36,560 --> 05:08:37,520
All right, I'm gonna roll once.

3194
05:08:37,520 --> 05:08:38,439
I'm gonna freeze this guy

3195
05:08:38,439 --> 05:08:39,279
because I think that's a good idea.

3196
05:08:39,279 --> 05:08:44,639
So we get one roll and we can sell.

3197
05:08:44,639 --> 05:08:59,779
Let's see what happens.

3198
05:08:59,779 --> 05:09:02,119
Okay, so this is level three.

3199
05:09:02,119 --> 05:09:08,150
I really need, there's no defense back here.

3200
05:09:08,150 --> 05:09:09,069
All right, let's do it.

3201
05:09:09,069 --> 05:09:21,500
This time, this is gonna be stupid.

3202
05:09:21,540 --> 05:09:25,439
Defense is unnecessary because of the nuke, yeah.

3203
05:09:25,439 --> 05:09:26,639
Well, I can tell you right now,

3204
05:09:26,639 --> 05:09:28,400
this could be really bad.

3205
05:09:36,909 --> 05:09:42,330
Okay, here we go.

3206
05:09:42,330 --> 05:09:47,130
Okay, do it again.

3207
05:09:47,130 --> 05:09:49,430
That's a win.

3208
05:09:49,430 --> 05:09:55,240
When am I gonna lose another game again?

3209
05:09:55,240 --> 05:09:56,680
You just have to lose every time

3210
05:09:56,680 --> 05:10:02,849
until you get level three hedgehog and a mushroom.

3211
05:10:02,849 --> 05:10:10,950
The goal now is to try to get these upgraded.

3212
05:10:10,950 --> 05:10:18,770
Okay, so I could do cupcake on the cat,

3213
05:10:18,770 --> 05:10:21,819
broccoli on the tiger, that doesn't do anything.

3214
05:10:21,819 --> 05:10:23,419
Upgrade the rooster, fuck the tiger.

3215
05:10:23,939 --> 05:10:28,560
Upgrades don't do anything on the tiger.

3216
05:10:28,560 --> 05:10:34,439
We're looking for a rooster.

3217
05:10:34,439 --> 05:10:36,200
So I'm gonna use chocolate on the rooster

3218
05:10:36,200 --> 05:10:40,810
and then we need to find a rooster.

3219
05:10:40,810 --> 05:10:43,049
It's so important to find a rooster right now.

3220
05:10:43,049 --> 05:10:48,110
I'm just gonna roll till I find one.

3221
05:10:48,110 --> 05:10:50,369
It's not a rooster.

3222
05:10:50,369 --> 05:10:53,729
It is a bison though.

3223
05:10:53,729 --> 05:10:56,340
Shit, can I do this twice?

3224
05:10:56,340 --> 05:11:00,009
Wait, hold on.

3225
05:11:00,009 --> 05:11:09,659
What if I mushroomed the tiger?

3226
05:11:09,659 --> 05:11:17,360
So then it would be 12 damage again.

3227
05:11:17,360 --> 05:11:27,349
This is literally impossible to beat.

3228
05:11:27,349 --> 05:11:30,430
I don't think there's a meta in this game

3229
05:11:30,430 --> 05:11:33,310
that could beat level three hedgehog,

3230
05:11:33,310 --> 05:11:37,150
mushroomed, mushroomed tiger.

3231
05:11:37,150 --> 05:11:41,779
I will always at least have one character left

3232
05:11:41,779 --> 05:11:45,110
unless they have something in the back.

3233
05:11:45,110 --> 05:11:52,009
It won't work, why not?

3234
05:11:52,009 --> 05:11:53,759
It will be dead.

3235
05:11:53,759 --> 05:11:55,479
Well, this blows up, this does 12 damage.

3236
05:11:55,479 --> 05:12:02,720
It comes back and then it does it again

3237
05:12:02,720 --> 05:12:05,250
because it has to die, because this has to die.

3238
05:12:05,250 --> 05:12:07,490
So when it comes back, it'll die

3239
05:12:07,490 --> 05:12:09,450
and then this will come back and then do it.

3240
05:12:09,450 --> 05:12:11,009
It, yeah, this should work.

3241
05:12:11,009 --> 05:12:15,400
Let's just do it, who cares?

3242
05:12:15,400 --> 05:12:27,080
And then we're gonna give splash damage to the bison.

3243
05:12:27,080 --> 05:12:34,889
Okay, good luck.

3244
05:12:34,889 --> 05:12:36,009
I have no idea what's gonna happen,

3245
05:12:36,009 --> 05:12:40,360
but it might be funny.

3246
05:12:40,880 --> 05:12:42,919
You're gonna get wiped out, buddy.

3247
05:12:42,919 --> 05:12:44,159
You're gonna get wiped out.

3248
05:12:44,159 --> 05:12:49,000
You have no idea, you're gonna get wiped out.

3249
05:12:49,000 --> 05:12:50,599
Oh, oh no, what happened?

3250
05:12:50,599 --> 05:12:57,200
What am I gonna do now?

3251
05:12:57,200 --> 05:13:00,220
It's gonna work, it's gonna work.

3252
05:13:00,220 --> 05:13:06,479
Oh God, wait, it didn't work?

3253
05:13:06,479 --> 05:13:13,119
Wait, why did that not work?

3254
05:13:13,119 --> 05:13:15,799
Why not?

3255
05:13:15,799 --> 05:13:18,029
Come on, are you kidding me?

3256
05:13:18,029 --> 05:13:24,400
Oh, rooster.

3257
05:13:24,400 --> 05:13:27,310
I win, oh my God.

3258
05:13:27,310 --> 05:13:37,680
No, that's what I didn't, don't relax, it's fine.

3259
05:13:37,680 --> 05:13:41,490
So I think it's just pizza.

3260
05:13:41,490 --> 05:13:44,500
Tiger doesn't really do anything.

3261
05:13:44,500 --> 05:13:50,889
B and pizza, B on the rooster?

3262
05:13:50,889 --> 05:13:55,790
Rooster, honey?

3263
05:13:55,790 --> 05:13:57,430
Rooster, honey, yeah, because then it would be,

3264
05:13:57,430 --> 05:14:00,229
yeah, it's over.

3265
05:14:00,229 --> 05:14:03,349
Honey on the rooster for sure.

3266
05:14:03,349 --> 05:14:06,360
Then we get a pizza.

3267
05:14:06,360 --> 05:14:08,119
Oh man, oh man, it's over.

3268
05:14:08,119 --> 05:14:11,080
I am, I'm gonna come back from the dead here.

3269
05:14:11,080 --> 05:14:12,639
I was at one heart.

3270
05:14:12,639 --> 05:14:21,680
I'm gonna win all eight of these games in a row.

3271
05:14:21,680 --> 05:14:22,799
I don't think there's anything else I do.

3272
05:14:22,799 --> 05:14:23,799
I think there's real for food,

3273
05:14:23,799 --> 05:14:33,599
which that's a pretty good, that's pretty good.

3274
05:14:33,599 --> 05:14:40,619
I'll keep this one.

3275
05:14:40,619 --> 05:14:41,779
This is just crazy enough, I think,

3276
05:14:41,779 --> 05:14:43,509
to carry us the whole way.

3277
05:14:43,509 --> 05:14:46,450
As long as I can keep that rooster alive.

3278
05:14:46,490 --> 05:14:48,130
Oh boy, that's very bad.

3279
05:14:48,130 --> 05:14:50,389
I don't think this is gonna play out.

3280
05:14:50,389 --> 05:14:52,799
Now I'm actually kind of scared.

3281
05:14:52,799 --> 05:14:54,080
It's not enough.

3282
05:14:54,080 --> 05:14:56,540
Is it not enough?

3283
05:14:56,540 --> 05:15:03,330
Shit, it's not enough.

3284
05:15:03,330 --> 05:15:05,049
Oh, it's just not enough.

3285
05:15:05,049 --> 05:15:07,130
He's gonna kill everybody.

3286
05:15:07,130 --> 05:15:09,650
No.

3287
05:15:09,650 --> 05:15:12,869
Oh, what the hell?

3288
05:15:12,869 --> 05:15:14,389
That was fun.

3289
05:15:14,389 --> 05:15:20,799
Now it's over.

3290
05:15:20,799 --> 05:15:22,639
How do you get a 50-50 goose?

3291
05:15:22,639 --> 05:15:23,479
That doesn't make any sense.

3292
05:15:23,479 --> 05:15:26,990
How do you get a 50-50 goose?

3293
05:15:26,990 --> 05:15:33,939
How does that happen?

3294
05:15:33,939 --> 05:15:35,259
All right, no, that's it, that's it.

3295
05:15:35,259 --> 05:15:36,540
This is only supposed to be like a stream

3296
05:15:36,540 --> 05:15:38,860
that was like an hour long.

3297
05:15:38,860 --> 05:15:41,270
I'll see you guys this weekend.

3298
05:15:41,270 --> 05:15:42,189
It was fun playing into it.

3299
05:15:42,709 --> 05:15:43,909
If anything, this tournament,

3300
05:15:43,909 --> 05:15:45,349
even though I lost like every game

3301
05:15:45,349 --> 05:15:48,689
and I didn't know what the hell I was doing,

3302
05:15:48,689 --> 05:15:49,509
this is really fun.

3303
05:15:49,509 --> 05:15:52,700
I like this a lot.

3304
05:15:52,700 --> 05:15:56,979
Thanks Ludwig for the invite.

3305
05:15:56,979 --> 05:16:01,099
I'll do better next time.

3306
05:16:01,099 --> 05:16:01,939
I'll see you guys this weekend,

3307
05:16:01,939 --> 05:16:04,709
either Friday or Sunday.

3308
05:16:04,709 --> 05:16:08,180
Let's see what Alex is up to.

3309
05:16:08,180 --> 05:16:11,479
See what day probably works better.

3310
05:16:11,479 --> 05:16:15,090
So I'll see you soon.

3311
05:16:15,090 --> 05:16:17,340
That was super AutoPets.

3312
05:16:17,340 --> 05:16:20,299
And that was a lot of fun.

3313
05:16:20,299 --> 05:16:23,360
Take care of yourselves.

3314
05:16:23,360 --> 05:16:25,150
We can run the credits though.

3315
05:16:25,150 --> 05:16:25,990
How long?

3316
05:16:25,990 --> 05:16:31,369
This stream is way longer than I thought it was.

3317
05:16:31,369 --> 05:16:35,090
Is Ludwig still streaming?

3318
05:16:35,090 --> 05:16:42,240
Like what the fuck just happened?

3319
05:16:42,240 --> 05:16:44,279
Let me see.

3320
05:16:44,279 --> 05:16:47,080
Yeah, we'll go raid Ludwig.

3321
05:16:47,080 --> 05:16:48,810
Playing AutoPets, right?

3322
05:16:48,810 --> 05:16:50,099
Go say hello.

3323
05:16:50,099 --> 05:16:54,200
Say thanks for the invite.

3324
05:16:54,200 --> 05:16:58,080
And I will see you guys later.

3325
05:16:58,080 --> 05:16:59,479
Thanks for coming.

3326
05:16:59,479 --> 05:17:01,180
Thanks to all the subs.

3327
05:17:01,180 --> 05:17:03,360
See you guys this weekend.

3328
05:17:03,360 --> 05:17:08,869
We can start the raid.

3329
05:17:08,869 --> 05:17:11,040
Raid.

3330
05:17:11,040 --> 05:17:12,119
I don't even know how many people are here.

3331
05:17:12,119 --> 05:17:16,770
I haven't even looked the whole time.

3332
05:17:16,770 --> 05:17:17,610
Was that fun to watch?

3333
05:17:17,610 --> 05:17:24,979
Cause it was like fun to play.

3334
05:17:24,979 --> 05:17:26,020
All right, I'll see you guys later.

3335
05:17:26,020 --> 05:17:35,909
Take care.

3336
05:17:35,909 --> 05:17:37,810
By the way, the game is free.

3337
05:17:37,810 --> 05:17:41,509
It's $5 to get the like DLC pets,

3338
05:17:41,509 --> 05:17:43,729
which I mean like really,

3339
05:17:43,729 --> 05:17:48,529
it's like $4.99 or something.

3340
05:17:48,529 --> 05:17:49,349
Take care of yourselves.

3341
05:17:49,349 --> 05:17:50,819
See you guys soon.

3342
05:17:50,819 --> 05:17:57,110
Have a great rest of your night and goodbye.
