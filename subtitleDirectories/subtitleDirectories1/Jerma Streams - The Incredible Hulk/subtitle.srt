1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:19,510
This next game is going to be fairly interesting to some of you. It's going to be a nice surprise.

2
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:34,700
I'm actually going to, I'm going to mute. I know there's at least 5500ish people here right now.

3
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:38,700
I guarantee at least 200 of you just like absolutely clog your pants.

4
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:46,710
I'm going to shave your pants. Let's turn it off so you can't hear what it is.

5
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:58,850
I don't want you to know. You say that for every game. Of course I do.

6
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:17,239
Okay. I'm calling it right now. It's Pikmin. No it's not. No it is not. Something else.

7
00:01:17,239 --> 00:01:31,629
Okay I don't want you to hear this. Oh man it's a really crunchy loud one.

8
00:01:31,629 --> 00:01:35,189
Holy shit. Hopefully this doesn't do this through the whole game.

9
00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:39,260
Okay hold on. You ready? I'm going to give you a hint.

10
00:01:39,260 --> 00:02:15,180
Ladies and gentlemen please if you would hold on to your seats for...

11
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:26,180
A game by Sega. We're talking of course about...

12
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:36,360
That's not the title of the game. Not Edge of Reality.

13
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:57,300
That's not the game also. Talking about Hulk Ultimate Destruction.

14
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:14,710
Am I sure this is not the sound clips that I was playing yesterday?

15
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:34,460
It's wicked loud is it? Let's go. Story mode.

16
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:48,080
The werewolf? This is not The Bachelor. Should I just keep it on The Bachelor?

17
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:55,819
Welcome to The Bachelor. I didn't get the rose.

18
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:58,819
That's illegal. That's twitch illegal.

19
00:03:58,819 --> 00:04:07,060
I'm trying to stop a monster. Edward Norton or pretend somebody is doing an Edward Norton voice.

20
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:29,290
Which one? What is it? The Incredible Hulk. The Incredible Hulk Ultimate Destruction.

21
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:34,290
The Incredible Hulk. The Pantheon Saga. Hulk Hogan's main event.

22
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:44,230
The Incredible Hulk.

23
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:54,019
Should I have a missile in here?

24
00:04:54,019 --> 00:05:03,370
Alright let's go. This is so fucking loud too. Hold on.

25
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:10,920
I'm going to turn this shit down.

26
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:18,889
What the fuck was that? Press B or Z to punch?

27
00:05:18,889 --> 00:05:22,509
I don't even know whether it was B or Z.

28
00:05:22,509 --> 00:05:35,529
Get through the door. Alright!

29
00:05:35,529 --> 00:05:39,019
Hey! What's going on everybody?

30
00:05:39,019 --> 00:05:44,019
Jerma here with a live broadcast stream. Welcome to the stream everybody.

31
00:05:44,019 --> 00:05:47,019
Playing The Incredible Hulk action.

32
00:05:47,019 --> 00:05:55,410
I can just walk into shit.

33
00:05:55,410 --> 00:06:18,490
Take and take care everybody.

34
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:23,329
Alright this is Hulk Ultimate Destruction.

35
00:06:23,329 --> 00:06:38,139
Think about it. When am I going to throw my first car?

36
00:06:38,139 --> 00:06:46,519
It's actually kind of fun.

37
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:50,300
Can I get rid of the helicopter?

38
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:54,879
I can Q up a punch. Hold on I can do a running punch.

39
00:06:54,879 --> 00:07:01,600
Why am I not playing the good Hulk game?

40
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,600
This is not the right video game.

41
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:09,139
This is the wrong video game.

42
00:07:09,139 --> 00:07:18,699
Look, it's Hulk Break Shit the game.

43
00:07:18,699 --> 00:07:20,699
Is it really that big of a difference?

44
00:07:20,699 --> 00:07:38,060
Yes? You tell me there's a difference?

45
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:43,680
What is this one called?

46
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,680
This is an extremely big difference.

47
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:52,019
It's not Madden.

48
00:07:52,019 --> 00:07:57,370
This is not Hulk Ultimate Destruction.

49
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Oh, it's the movie tie-in game.

50
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:16,259
It's the movie tie-in licensed movie game.

51
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:19,259
The one for the GameCube was just a game that was made for the GameCube.

52
00:08:19,259 --> 00:08:21,259
Not a licensed. It's the movie.

53
00:08:21,259 --> 00:08:27,579
That's why Edward Norton's in this movie.

54
00:08:27,579 --> 00:08:40,700
But we're playing it anyways.

55
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:43,450
But you can do this in this one.

56
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:45,450
Hulk's health is dangerously low. Heal.

57
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:48,450
Press left or right to select Hulk's healing factor.

58
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:50,450
Then shake the nunchuck and press B.

59
00:08:50,450 --> 00:09:03,759
That was dumb.

60
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:15,559
Can I pick up weapons?

61
00:09:15,559 --> 00:09:23,899
Beats our challenge as Hulk completes to earn new powers and enhancements.

62
00:09:23,899 --> 00:09:26,899
When he completes a feat, the upgrade indicator appears.

63
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:31,899
Press 1 to access the upgrade screen and see the newly completed feat and associated upgrade.

64
00:09:31,899 --> 00:09:41,139
Healing factor. Hulk has innate ability to heal.

65
00:09:41,139 --> 00:09:44,809
Oh, there's like a Street Fighter menu.

66
00:09:44,809 --> 00:09:48,809
Punching bag is BBBB. Body toss is Z.

67
00:09:48,809 --> 00:09:53,720
How do you grab?

68
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:57,720
ZZZZZZZZZB.

69
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:00,730
Grab is down.

70
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:06,580
Alright, cool. Let's go back.

71
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:10,549
That's grab. Alright, I'm ready.

72
00:10:10,549 --> 00:10:13,620
What's the deal with the Hulk?

73
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:18,730
Pick up an object.

74
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:21,730
And you guys all thought this was going to be like a boring game.

75
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:23,730
But now I can throw shit at people.

76
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:26,799
Hold down C to target.

77
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:35,889
That's C.

78
00:10:35,889 --> 00:10:38,450
Wait, that's not C?

79
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:41,940
Hold down C to target.

80
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:50,840
Alright, I've got somebody's...

81
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,529
I was going to make an internal organ joke.

82
00:10:53,529 --> 00:10:56,340
C.

83
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:58,340
Hold down C to target.

84
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:07,750
That's C, right?

85
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:23,610
I did it.

86
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:29,100
Who's this?

87
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:40,549
Defeat Blonsky.

88
00:11:40,549 --> 00:11:42,549
Alright, I just embarrassed this guy.

89
00:11:42,549 --> 00:11:44,549
Just keep going.

90
00:11:44,549 --> 00:11:48,840
Into the wall.

91
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:53,259
It's a gorilla.

92
00:11:53,259 --> 00:11:57,990
Wait, what is it? Hold down...what is it?

93
00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:05,929
Oh, this.

94
00:12:05,929 --> 00:12:28,779
Watch me do this.

95
00:12:28,779 --> 00:12:39,210
Keep playing. I'm going to keep playing.

96
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:42,860
Just wait until I get out and I can jump around in cars.

97
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,440
Oh, and then you're going to ask.

98
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:13,460
This is literally the movie.

99
00:13:21,299 --> 00:13:23,299
It's just the movie.

100
00:13:23,299 --> 00:13:25,299
NSA listening post.

101
00:13:25,299 --> 00:13:37,909
Undisclosed location.

102
00:13:43,909 --> 00:13:45,909
That's Ed Norton.

103
00:13:53,909 --> 00:13:55,909
It is.

104
00:13:55,909 --> 00:13:57,909
That's a good Ed Norton.

105
00:13:57,909 --> 00:14:03,740
At the bottom of the screen is the minimap showing

106
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:05,740
Hulk and the surrounding area.

107
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:26,860
I didn't even do that one.

108
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:28,860
I didn't do that one either.

109
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:30,860
I didn't do that.

110
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:34,759
He just drove into the wall and

111
00:14:34,759 --> 00:14:36,759
exploded.

112
00:14:36,759 --> 00:14:41,820
Hey, easy.

113
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:14,970
Why can you do that?

114
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:16,970
In the Spider-Man game you couldn't do that.

115
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:19,340
You couldn't do

116
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:21,340
this shit in the Spider-Man game?

117
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:24,730
You go like, oh, have a good day.

118
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:26,730
I'm Spider-Man in the Hulk.

119
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:28,730
Why can I just fucking

120
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:40,700
blast that lady?

121
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:43,000
Why?

122
00:16:11,019 --> 00:16:14,139
He's eating a candy stick.

123
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:16,139
Baby Hulk is upset.

124
00:16:16,139 --> 00:16:43,379
Why?

125
00:16:43,379 --> 00:16:45,379
It's so funny.

126
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:47,379
It's fucking hilarious.

127
00:16:47,379 --> 00:16:51,480
In a building?

128
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:54,039
Wait, I can't

129
00:16:54,039 --> 00:16:56,039
battlefield this building.

130
00:16:56,039 --> 00:16:58,039
Can I?

131
00:16:58,039 --> 00:17:00,039
And all you motherfuckers wanted me to change

132
00:17:00,039 --> 00:17:12,900
the game.

133
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:17,829
Can I?

134
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:25,960
I lost my pole.

135
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:35,619
What do I have to go?

136
00:17:42,779 --> 00:17:47,190
I'm going to go this way.

137
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:50,390
Pick somebody up.

138
00:17:50,390 --> 00:18:15,190
Help him.

139
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:17,190
I'm the reason why he needed

140
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:21,859
to be helped.

141
00:18:21,859 --> 00:18:26,789
It's fucking unbelievable.

142
00:18:26,789 --> 00:18:29,480
I don't care if I don't even play

143
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,480
this game for another 20 fucking minutes.

144
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:37,559
Who gives a shit if it's worth it?

145
00:18:37,559 --> 00:18:42,299
The other Hulk game is better.

146
00:18:42,299 --> 00:18:44,299
Those don't look like army forces.

147
00:18:44,299 --> 00:18:46,299
They're attacking the city.

148
00:18:46,299 --> 00:18:48,299
It looks strong, but Hulk is stronger.

149
00:18:48,299 --> 00:18:56,940
Show them just how strong he is.

150
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:59,559
Holy shit.

151
00:18:59,559 --> 00:19:02,250
It's just this

152
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:04,250
but better?

153
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:11,539
Is it?

154
00:19:11,539 --> 00:19:13,539
Alright, I'll get it.

155
00:19:13,539 --> 00:19:15,539
I'll get it immediately. It'll be here in fucking two days.

156
00:19:15,539 --> 00:19:30,460
It'll be here in

157
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:40,950
two days. Guaranteed.

158
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:42,950
Wait, this is not a bad guy?

159
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:45,829
This is not a bad guy.

160
00:19:45,829 --> 00:19:55,940
This it was? Look,

161
00:19:55,940 --> 00:20:03,819
it was on the minimap.

162
00:20:03,819 --> 00:20:10,980
That guy was already dead.

163
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:12,980
I can't wait. You're telling me it's just a better version of the

164
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:14,980
other one? Oh man, I can't wait.

165
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:18,630
I can't pick this shit up?

166
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:48,180
It looks like broke the guy's neck.

167
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:50,180
Why did it explode?

168
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:52,180
Oh shit.

169
00:20:52,180 --> 00:21:04,279
Stand next to buildings and jump by pressing

170
00:21:04,279 --> 00:21:06,279
to cling to the side of a building.

171
00:21:06,279 --> 00:21:09,990
Wait, I can jump up here too?

172
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:11,990
Okay, I can't wait to play the new one.

173
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:14,740
I get to experience the new one.

174
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:16,740
Fuck your AC.

175
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:28,970
It's actually older.

176
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:38,809
It is older.

177
00:21:38,809 --> 00:21:48,519
It's seen us.

178
00:21:48,519 --> 00:21:50,519
Jump higher or farther, hold down A.

179
00:21:50,519 --> 00:22:16,549
I fucking love this.

180
00:22:16,549 --> 00:22:18,549
It's Mario Sunshine all over again.

181
00:22:18,549 --> 00:22:40,180
How durable is this guy?

182
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:42,180
Uh, pretty durable.

183
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:44,180
No, they're playing laser tag.

184
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:55,559
I don't think he's...

185
00:22:55,559 --> 00:23:16,039
He had a health bar.

186
00:23:16,039 --> 00:23:20,200
Dude, you're telling me to do like a charge.

187
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,200
I don't even need to do that. Alright, where are they at?

188
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,200
I'm ready for them.

189
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:39,369
How do you move the camera?

190
00:23:39,369 --> 00:23:48,650
Holy fuck, that move is so ridiculous.

191
00:23:48,650 --> 00:24:02,140
Climb!

192
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:19,339
Climb!

193
00:24:19,339 --> 00:24:21,900
Okay, we're good. Probably lose to the helicopter.

194
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:25,849
Oh, we're good. No, I did it.

195
00:24:25,849 --> 00:24:31,930
This looks like a mobile game.

196
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:33,930
Oh, plot armor.

197
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:35,930
That makes sense.

198
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:40,220
I've never even seen this movie.

199
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:53,819
Dude, they're like baseball swing

200
00:24:53,819 --> 00:24:55,819
with the telephone pole.

201
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:02,180
So unnecessary.

202
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:04,180
They use Manhattan as a giant test site.

203
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:06,180
The jokesters on the roof?

204
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:08,180
Specialists in artificial intelligence

205
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:10,180
that's morphed into mind control.

206
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:12,180
I came across some stuff that I shouldn't have.

207
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:14,180
I know these guys have to be stopped.

208
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:16,180
Whatever you were about to say.

209
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:18,180
Full on face scan.

210
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:20,180
It isn't on anyone's side.

211
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:22,180
He helped me, right?

212
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:24,180
I guarantee you there is a video that you unlock

213
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:26,180
where it's Ed Norton

214
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:28,180
getting his face scanned.

215
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:32,089
Put this transmitter in your ear.

216
00:25:32,089 --> 00:25:34,089
Hopefully it'll survive your transformation.

217
00:25:34,089 --> 00:25:36,089
Where'd you get this?

218
00:25:36,089 --> 00:25:38,089
You'd be amazed at what you can find in places you shouldn't be looking.

219
00:25:38,089 --> 00:25:40,089
Watch your back, by the way.

220
00:25:40,089 --> 00:25:42,089
There's a large military presence in town.

221
00:25:42,089 --> 00:25:44,089
It's gonna be like a Viggo Mortensen

222
00:25:44,089 --> 00:25:46,089
Lord of the Rings interview.

223
00:26:02,019 --> 00:26:04,019
What's the first thing you do in GTA?

224
00:26:04,019 --> 00:26:06,019
I see all the D faces.

225
00:26:06,019 --> 00:26:08,019
The first thing you do when you open up GTA

226
00:26:08,019 --> 00:26:10,019
is you turn and you punch the closest person

227
00:26:10,019 --> 00:26:13,160
in the face next to you.

228
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:15,160
That's the tutorial in GTA.

229
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:21,880
And when you do it, you go,

230
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:36,470
Oh, shit!

231
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:45,880
Oh, I gotta go this way.

232
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:49,980
Are there any other cars besides taxis and trucks?

233
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:51,980
Leon Clavin, Rick Jones, part 2.

234
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:54,920
Why am I just walking around like this?

235
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,920
Don't people know who the Hulk is?

236
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:59,099
Oh, no, this is the movie

237
00:26:59,099 --> 00:27:01,099
licensed standalone movie.

238
00:27:01,099 --> 00:27:10,819
This is pre-

239
00:27:10,819 --> 00:27:12,819
stop frowning. I can't help it. I have a huge problem.

240
00:27:12,819 --> 00:27:16,089
Fight the army.

241
00:27:16,089 --> 00:27:31,450
I always

242
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:33,880
swing with it.

243
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:42,460
Give me one of the trees. I'm gonna get a tree.

244
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:56,519
Give me a tree.

245
00:27:56,519 --> 00:28:07,210
I know those soldiers are bugging you, but

246
00:28:07,210 --> 00:28:09,210
I just got a lead on an Enclave lab

247
00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:11,210
hidden in a building. Thinking you'd knock

248
00:28:11,210 --> 00:28:13,210
that sucker down. Giant toothpick.

249
00:28:13,210 --> 00:28:17,240
The icon fades. The farther Hulk is from

250
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:19,240
the object, it indicates. As Hulk gets close

251
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:26,089
to the icon, it becomes more solid.

252
00:28:26,089 --> 00:28:36,779
Hulk can't do

253
00:28:36,779 --> 00:28:45,849
this.

254
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:47,849
By breaking an ATM? This is an

255
00:28:47,849 --> 00:28:49,849
Enclave base. The Paragon Corporation

256
00:28:49,849 --> 00:28:51,849
sign is a giveaway. Paragon

257
00:28:51,849 --> 00:28:53,849
is the front company for the Enclave

258
00:28:53,849 --> 00:28:55,849
and they leave buildings all over the city.

259
00:28:58,019 --> 00:29:05,940
Open it. Hulk can destroy

260
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:07,940
buildings all around the city, but not without attracting

261
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:09,940
attention.

262
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:16,920
What are you doing?

263
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,920
Why are you driving directly?

264
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,920
I have no power

265
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:26,420
on this.

266
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:28,420
The ambulance isn't gonna do it, right? Of course, at least

267
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:48,650
the ambulance is smart. What is that?

268
00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:50,890
What does the woman do over there?

269
00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:52,890
What am I trying to grab? What is that thing?

270
00:29:52,890 --> 00:29:59,589
Was this a person?

271
00:29:59,589 --> 00:30:01,589
I still want to pick up a fucking rock.

272
00:30:01,589 --> 00:30:04,339
Hulk can now perform combo attacks

273
00:30:04,339 --> 00:30:23,160
with a shield. Okay.

274
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:25,660
Why would the Hulk need a shield?

275
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:35,450
I just bounced him. Let's go.

276
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:44,019
Down. Down. Swing down.

277
00:30:44,019 --> 00:30:46,200
Swing down. Swing down.

278
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:48,200
This game being on the Wii,

279
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,200
was this game on PlayStation 2?

280
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:57,369
I feel like it probably was.

281
00:30:57,369 --> 00:31:03,380
Yes, it was. I charged it up.

282
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:14,390
I can fly with this thing?

283
00:31:14,390 --> 00:31:23,670
What am I supposed to be doing?

284
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:28,089
Boss has more men down here than you could believe.

285
00:31:28,089 --> 00:31:30,089
This is the kill of these guys.

286
00:31:30,089 --> 00:31:32,089
I think you're gonna be able to stop a strike team once it's activated.

287
00:31:32,089 --> 00:31:34,089
Your only option is to lie low and wait

288
00:31:34,089 --> 00:31:36,089
for things to blow over. Wait, there's like a

289
00:31:36,089 --> 00:31:38,089
getaway from the cops? Get to the subway.

290
00:31:38,089 --> 00:31:40,089
You should be able to lose the army in the tunnel.

291
00:31:40,089 --> 00:31:42,089
Holy shit.

292
00:31:42,089 --> 00:31:44,089
Hulk can use the subway to move around the city faster.

293
00:31:44,089 --> 00:31:46,089
The yellow circle S

294
00:31:46,089 --> 00:31:48,089
on the menu have the subway locations.

295
00:31:48,089 --> 00:31:50,650
They get a new shield at any time.

296
00:31:50,650 --> 00:31:52,650
Press A, B while unarmed.

297
00:31:52,650 --> 00:32:01,670
And on the ground.

298
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:06,599
Get out of here. I gotta move. I gotta go.

299
00:32:06,599 --> 00:32:11,589
You can also fly.

300
00:32:11,589 --> 00:32:13,589
Hulk GTA on mobile.

301
00:32:13,589 --> 00:32:20,309
This does look like one of those reskins.

302
00:32:20,309 --> 00:32:22,309
Where the guy

303
00:32:22,309 --> 00:32:24,309
made 10

304
00:32:24,309 --> 00:32:26,309
GTA clones and they all have

305
00:32:26,309 --> 00:32:28,309
licensed characters.

306
00:32:28,309 --> 00:32:36,740
Did I make it? Wait.

307
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:38,740
I just had to walk in it.

308
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:42,259
Okay.

309
00:32:42,259 --> 00:32:44,500
Mission complete.

310
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:47,509
Subway is open.

311
00:32:47,509 --> 00:32:50,140
Oh shit. It costs

312
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:52,140
$5 on the app store.

313
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:58,220
Travel the New York subway system.

314
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:00,220
The map is kind of big.

315
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:02,779
It's kind of a big map.

316
00:33:02,779 --> 00:33:08,660
How does Hulk ride the bus?

317
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:10,660
How does Hulk get on the train?

318
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:27,049
He walks in the tunnels.

319
00:33:27,049 --> 00:33:32,789
Oh.

320
00:33:32,789 --> 00:33:36,059
I didn't mean to do that.

321
00:33:36,059 --> 00:33:38,059
Let's get as high as we can and we gotta get to the top

322
00:33:38,059 --> 00:33:40,059
of the Empire State Building and look down like you do in

323
00:33:40,059 --> 00:33:53,619
Spider-Man.

324
00:33:53,619 --> 00:33:58,039
No fall damage.

325
00:33:58,039 --> 00:34:00,039
The four enclave sectors have hidden their bases at key locations

326
00:34:00,039 --> 00:34:02,220
in the city. Occasionally they will send out an assault group

327
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:04,220
to test the destructive power of their weapons.

328
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:08,809
Warning.

329
00:34:08,809 --> 00:34:10,809
An enclave assault group is active.

330
00:34:10,809 --> 00:34:13,880
Oh shit. I went too far.

331
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:22,250
This game came out before

332
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:26,150
prototype.

333
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:31,719
This game is actually kind of cool.

334
00:34:31,719 --> 00:34:33,719
Is the stark tower

335
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:37,110
here? Where's stark

336
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:39,349
tower? Wait. What's this?

337
00:34:39,349 --> 00:34:41,349
What was it? Did you see that? What was that?

338
00:34:41,349 --> 00:34:43,849
It was like a little ring up here.

339
00:34:43,849 --> 00:34:45,849
How do I move the camera?

340
00:34:45,849 --> 00:35:00,679
Click the YouTube link.

341
00:35:00,679 --> 00:35:02,679
Click the link. Wait, wait, wait.

342
00:35:02,679 --> 00:35:10,679
What is it? What is it? This needs music.

343
00:35:10,679 --> 00:35:13,880
Oh, I see.

344
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:47,590
Ground pound.

345
00:35:47,590 --> 00:36:07,289
Skip.

346
00:36:07,289 --> 00:36:11,880
Is it me talking?

347
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:14,119
We have to hurry. Can you

348
00:36:14,119 --> 00:36:18,090
carry me? I'm carrying

349
00:36:18,090 --> 00:36:25,110
this person?

350
00:36:25,110 --> 00:36:27,110
You don't want to be here.

351
00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:29,480
I'm wearing this. This guy's a human backpack.

352
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:42,219
Hulk found his first

353
00:36:42,219 --> 00:36:44,219
fury canister.

354
00:36:44,219 --> 00:36:47,860
There are another 99 hidden

355
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:49,860
throughout New York City. Collect more to increase

356
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:51,860
Hulk's rage.

357
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:53,860
Ugh.

358
00:36:53,860 --> 00:37:10,440
Ultimate destruction.

359
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:13,449
Did somebody just fly?

360
00:37:13,449 --> 00:37:16,969
Alright, get over here.

361
00:37:16,969 --> 00:37:42,489
Oh, we're out of time, time, time, time, time, time, time, time, time, time.

362
00:37:42,489 --> 00:37:44,489
Oh, it felt good.

363
00:37:44,489 --> 00:38:06,630
This character is just like

364
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:11,239
I'm not, yeah.

365
00:38:11,239 --> 00:38:13,239
Give me that.

366
00:38:13,239 --> 00:38:22,710
Give me, give me, give me, give me,

367
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:31,800
give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me.

368
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,800
He just got squashed.

369
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:39,500
Are they down below?

370
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:42,179
Done?

371
00:38:42,179 --> 00:38:53,750
Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright.

372
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:57,460
My sources, these bombs came from

373
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:59,460
a specific research facility.

374
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:15,059
Hmm.

375
00:39:15,059 --> 00:39:17,059
Go on the top right.

376
00:39:17,059 --> 00:39:25,320
Nice throw.

377
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:27,320
Ooh, it's stuck in the building.

378
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:36,730
You move with the game? Yes, I do.

379
00:39:36,730 --> 00:39:39,030
I'm one of those fucking psychos.

380
00:39:39,030 --> 00:39:51,260
Come here, come here, come here, come here,

381
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:53,260
come here, come here, come here, come here, come here, come here, come here.

382
00:39:53,260 --> 00:40:08,409
You!

383
00:40:08,409 --> 00:40:16,710
Hey, you!

384
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:18,710
This, this more?

385
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:25,300
That's it.

386
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:27,300
Defeat the remaining fuck.

387
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:43,110
Shit, canisters, a fanabase.

388
00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:54,500
Punch him!

389
00:40:54,500 --> 00:41:03,780
How many more are left?

390
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:06,090
Oh, this guy here.

391
00:41:06,090 --> 00:41:20,730
See ya.

392
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:26,500
Top right, be like, what?

393
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:28,500
What are you talking about? Top right, what the fuck?

394
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:39,190
What? It's you.

395
00:41:39,190 --> 00:41:47,579
I'm bringing a truck with me this time.

396
00:42:14,469 --> 00:42:16,469
Alright, did he fall? Alright.

397
00:42:16,469 --> 00:42:18,469
Don't forget about me, I won't.

398
00:42:18,469 --> 00:42:21,099
Alright, here we go, down the bowl.

399
00:42:21,099 --> 00:42:25,579
Get it all with the truck. Didn't work.

400
00:42:25,579 --> 00:42:34,469
Top right of the screen is me.

401
00:42:34,469 --> 00:42:36,469
I know, I know!

402
00:42:36,469 --> 00:42:38,469
It's not though, it's this guy.

403
00:42:38,469 --> 00:42:45,769
I always remember looking at the chat and the game at the same time.

404
00:42:45,769 --> 00:42:47,769
You were right here!

405
00:42:47,769 --> 00:42:51,670
Good throw.

406
00:42:51,670 --> 00:43:12,019
Nice. Look at me, look at me.

407
00:43:12,019 --> 00:43:14,019
Jervis Grumpy.

408
00:43:14,019 --> 00:43:17,219
What? I'm not Grumpy, what are you talking about?

409
00:43:17,219 --> 00:43:31,690
He's pissed, I'm not pissed, I'm happy.

410
00:43:33,690 --> 00:43:35,690
Playing hold, ultimate destruction for the week.

411
00:43:35,690 --> 00:43:37,690
How could I not be happy?

412
00:43:37,690 --> 00:43:46,139
You know, give me, give me one of these.

413
00:43:46,139 --> 00:43:50,420
Hit him in the fucking skull.

414
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:54,139
How could you not like it?

415
00:43:54,139 --> 00:43:59,320
This isn't ultimate destruction, I know.

416
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:04,780
Alright, on a scale of one to ten, how much better of a game is ultimate destruction than licensed Hulk video games?

417
00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:06,780
Ten.

418
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:15,019
Ten.

419
00:44:15,019 --> 00:44:18,150
Oh wait, this one came out, this is the newer one.

420
00:44:18,150 --> 00:44:20,150
Why is this one not as good?

421
00:44:20,150 --> 00:44:22,150
Watch the trailer, nope.

422
00:44:22,150 --> 00:44:26,889
I want to go in blind, completely blind.

423
00:44:26,889 --> 00:44:29,059
I don't want to see a single thing.

424
00:44:29,059 --> 00:44:31,300
This was a cash grab.

425
00:44:34,309 --> 00:44:39,820
This is bootleg tie-in.

426
00:44:39,820 --> 00:44:41,820
Bootleg license tie-in.

427
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:43,820
What else is over here?

428
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:49,239
What else is over here?

429
00:44:49,239 --> 00:44:51,239
Oh, I have to break the door?

430
00:44:51,239 --> 00:44:53,480
Is it the door?

431
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:55,849
Or is it just break the building?

432
00:44:55,849 --> 00:44:59,179
This looks like a Minecraft creative level.

433
00:45:01,929 --> 00:45:03,929
It does not look like that.

434
00:45:03,929 --> 00:45:11,159
It actually kind of does.

435
00:45:11,159 --> 00:45:15,449
It actually kind of does.

436
00:45:15,449 --> 00:45:19,099
How come I can't do anything?

437
00:45:19,099 --> 00:45:30,599
Oh.

438
00:45:48,460 --> 00:45:55,500
Cause I destroyed it.

439
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:58,059
Ultimate destruction even looks better.

440
00:45:58,059 --> 00:46:07,269
Really?

441
00:46:07,269 --> 00:46:09,269
That scared the shit out of me.

442
00:46:09,269 --> 00:46:20,090
I thought that was like somebody outside my window for a second.

443
00:46:20,090 --> 00:46:22,090
Like I just heard it down here.

444
00:46:22,090 --> 00:46:24,090
Like listen, like

445
00:46:24,090 --> 00:46:26,389
Like somebody here in the house.

446
00:46:26,389 --> 00:46:37,900
What's the next mission?

447
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:40,710
That sounds like Woody from Toy Story.

448
00:46:48,199 --> 00:46:56,010
Help! Buzz!

449
00:46:56,010 --> 00:47:00,739
How do you put somebody down?

450
00:47:00,739 --> 00:47:02,739
I want to hear that. You're violating!

451
00:47:02,739 --> 00:47:06,900
That actually does sound like Woody.

452
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:08,900
That could be like a Buzz Lightyear.

453
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:10,900
It sounds like Buzz Lightyear more than Woody.

454
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:23,000
How do I put people down?

455
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
I think they're going to be okay.

456
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:30,760
They're okay.

457
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:32,760
Holy shit.

458
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:34,760
That was like a super choke slam.

459
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:44,099
Alright, I'm going to do one more mission

460
00:47:44,099 --> 00:47:46,099
in a Hulk tie-in movie game.

461
00:47:46,099 --> 00:47:48,099
And then I'm going to

462
00:47:48,099 --> 00:47:50,099
play the actual one

463
00:47:50,099 --> 00:47:55,349
cause this is the wrong game.

464
00:47:55,349 --> 00:47:57,349
But I feel like

465
00:47:57,349 --> 00:47:59,349
we got some value from this.

466
00:47:59,349 --> 00:48:01,349
I'm happy that I got to play this.

467
00:48:05,829 --> 00:48:07,829
I'm very happy about this.

468
00:48:07,829 --> 00:48:18,309
Alright, last mission.

469
00:48:18,309 --> 00:48:20,309
How much did I pay?

470
00:48:20,309 --> 00:48:22,309
I don't think this is more than like five dollars.

471
00:48:22,309 --> 00:48:24,809
This is probably like six and a half dollars.

472
00:48:24,809 --> 00:48:31,719
Maybe.

473
00:48:31,719 --> 00:48:34,980
Choke slam somebody from the tallest building.

474
00:48:46,230 --> 00:48:48,230
I can't. I don't think I can do that.

475
00:48:48,230 --> 00:48:50,730
I have to jump there.

476
00:48:50,730 --> 00:48:54,309
Choke slam from the highest possible place.

477
00:48:54,309 --> 00:48:56,309
Cause I can't climb.

478
00:48:56,309 --> 00:49:01,110
Alright, I can go from here to here.

479
00:49:01,110 --> 00:49:04,889
Right here.

480
00:49:04,889 --> 00:49:07,130
There.

481
00:49:07,130 --> 00:49:13,719
We can jump up here.

482
00:49:13,719 --> 00:49:15,719
And then I can go over this way.

483
00:49:15,719 --> 00:49:18,659
Up to that building.

484
00:49:18,659 --> 00:49:24,940
Okay.

485
00:49:24,940 --> 00:49:28,650
Up here.

486
00:49:28,650 --> 00:49:32,420
Any other buildings I can do?

487
00:49:32,420 --> 00:49:37,929
Can I get up on this one?

488
00:49:37,929 --> 00:49:43,219
Over there?

489
00:49:43,219 --> 00:49:45,909
Might be too far.

490
00:49:45,909 --> 00:49:51,030
I think it's too far to get over there.

491
00:49:51,030 --> 00:49:57,820
It's not. Let's see.

492
00:49:57,820 --> 00:50:05,940
No, over there.

493
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:22,059
Over here.

494
00:50:22,059 --> 00:50:24,059
Rotate the camera a little bit.

495
00:50:24,059 --> 00:50:26,059
How about this way?

496
00:50:26,059 --> 00:50:31,820
I think this is as good as it's going to get.

497
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:41,800
Okay, we need a good spot.

498
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:43,800
That I can go all the way to the ground.

499
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:54,420
That was an elbow drop.

500
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:59,239
That was a full on landing with the elbow in his chest.

501
00:50:59,239 --> 00:51:40,969
I broke his arm.

502
00:51:40,969 --> 00:51:54,969
Still alive? Wow.

503
00:51:54,969 --> 00:51:57,659
Didn't kill him. He's still alive.

504
00:51:58,659 --> 00:52:17,059
Line up. This will kill him.

505
00:52:17,059 --> 00:52:31,710
Holy shit.

506
00:52:31,710 --> 00:52:33,710
Did I gamma ray this guy from the top rope?

507
00:52:33,710 --> 00:52:39,199
He's invincible.

508
00:52:39,199 --> 00:52:57,500
He's actually unkillable.

509
00:52:57,500 --> 00:52:59,500
I knocked him over.

510
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:01,679
What if I run him over with a car?

511
00:53:01,679 --> 00:53:19,920
That was brutal.

512
00:53:29,610 --> 00:53:42,710
Stay right here for a second.

513
00:53:42,710 --> 00:54:03,260
The cops?

514
00:54:03,260 --> 00:54:11,050
He's still alive. He's still good.

515
00:54:11,050 --> 00:54:18,409
How do I kill him?

516
00:54:18,409 --> 00:54:23,400
That's it.

517
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:31,659
Here, punch this guy.

518
00:54:31,659 --> 00:54:43,179
You can't do it either.

519
00:54:43,179 --> 00:54:47,980
Throw him into the ocean.

520
00:54:47,980 --> 00:54:49,980
You want me to throw him in the ocean?

521
00:54:49,980 --> 00:54:52,340
I'm going to throw him in the ocean.

522
00:54:52,340 --> 00:55:06,940
I was supposed to do a mission.

523
00:55:06,940 --> 00:55:16,460
Ocean.

524
00:55:16,460 --> 00:55:18,949
You're not coming back from this one.

525
00:55:18,949 --> 00:55:21,130
Not a chance at health.

526
00:55:21,130 --> 00:55:55,349
Definitely dead.

527
00:55:55,349 --> 00:56:03,099
The game automatically does this to you.

528
00:56:03,099 --> 00:56:15,829
He's dead.

529
00:56:15,829 --> 00:56:24,090
Last mission.

530
00:56:24,090 --> 00:56:30,340
He will return.

531
00:56:30,340 --> 00:56:32,340
It's the same model.

532
00:56:32,340 --> 00:56:34,340
It's the same model.

533
00:56:34,340 --> 00:56:40,230
Let's go.

534
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:47,780
Final mission.

535
00:56:47,780 --> 00:56:58,469
It was a GMod map.

536
00:56:58,469 --> 00:57:03,460
GM city.

537
00:57:03,460 --> 00:57:05,460
I took a shower and you're being psycho.

538
00:57:08,409 --> 00:57:10,409
What did I do?

539
00:57:10,409 --> 00:57:16,469
It really is big city.

540
00:57:18,469 --> 00:57:20,469
Big city in GMod.

541
00:57:20,469 --> 00:57:30,710
I can stand on them?

542
00:57:30,710 --> 00:57:32,710
I can stand on cars.

543
00:57:32,710 --> 00:57:35,019
This is important.

544
00:57:35,019 --> 00:57:44,230
I can stand on shit.

545
00:57:44,230 --> 00:57:46,230
I'm trying to get you to...

546
00:57:46,230 --> 00:57:48,230
I need to make a traffic jam.

547
00:57:48,230 --> 00:57:50,230
I want you to bump into each other.

548
00:57:50,230 --> 00:57:58,099
Very gently and explode.

549
00:57:58,099 --> 00:58:05,340
It's possible.

550
00:58:05,340 --> 00:58:17,349
Let me save you here.

551
00:58:17,349 --> 00:58:20,679
Get on the bus.

552
00:58:20,679 --> 00:58:24,579
Just throw this and get on him.

553
00:58:24,579 --> 00:58:26,579
I'm the Hulk. Of course it's going to break.

554
00:58:34,199 --> 00:58:37,659
The Bachelor.

555
00:58:37,659 --> 00:58:40,340
Quit streaming.

556
00:58:46,820 --> 00:58:52,139
Nice flip phone, Bruce.

557
00:58:52,139 --> 00:58:54,139
This is like 2003.

558
00:59:08,900 --> 00:59:13,699
I'm right here, dude.

559
00:59:13,699 --> 00:59:15,699
You're in a tank?

560
00:59:15,699 --> 00:59:18,329
You need backup and you're in a tank.

561
00:59:22,630 --> 00:59:41,320
Watch out for the cabs.

562
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:43,320
Whatever his name is.

563
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:47,320
Why was this a 3D movie?

564
00:59:58,460 --> 01:00:02,739
Nice.

565
01:00:02,739 --> 01:00:04,739
Perfect.

566
01:00:04,739 --> 01:00:06,739
A railroad spike. Whatever it is.

567
01:00:06,739 --> 01:00:18,329
A railroad stick.

568
01:00:18,329 --> 01:00:20,329
Not that powerful, actually.

569
01:00:20,329 --> 01:00:25,000
No!

570
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:30,119
I needed that bus.

571
01:00:30,119 --> 01:00:47,000
Any more buses?

572
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
These things are so fragile.

573
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,429
They're blowing up in my hands.

574
01:00:51,429 --> 01:00:53,429
They made it a paper mache.

575
01:00:53,429 --> 01:00:59,880
I didn't do anything.

576
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:01,880
They made it a thin glass.

577
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:10,579
That one's still driving.

578
01:01:10,579 --> 01:01:14,230
Alright, look for a bus.

579
01:01:14,230 --> 01:01:21,400
That's all I care about.

580
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:23,400
Throw a truck in the air and then shoot it in the air with a car.

581
01:01:47,699 --> 01:01:52,760
No!

582
01:01:52,760 --> 01:02:02,170
You can't get these guys away from me.

583
01:02:02,170 --> 01:02:07,590
Oh, my head.

584
01:02:07,590 --> 01:02:10,219
That was like waking up

585
01:02:10,219 --> 01:02:12,219
really early when you're on the top bunk

586
01:02:12,219 --> 01:02:14,219
and you smash your head on the ceiling.

587
01:02:14,219 --> 01:02:16,219
You guys have that problem?

588
01:02:16,219 --> 01:02:34,309
Alright, I'm jumping.

589
01:02:34,309 --> 01:02:44,869
Fox, get these guys off me.

590
01:02:44,869 --> 01:02:49,860
I'm coming, Slippy.

591
01:02:49,860 --> 01:03:02,599
I didn't even want to pick you up.

592
01:03:04,599 --> 01:03:08,250
Everybody's Elmo.

593
01:03:08,250 --> 01:03:10,250
Every character is Elmo.

594
01:03:10,250 --> 01:03:12,250
Every single character is Elmo.

595
01:03:12,250 --> 01:03:26,329
Don't you guys know that by now?

596
01:03:26,329 --> 01:03:35,610
Bus. I need a bus.

597
01:03:35,610 --> 01:03:37,610
I need a bus.

598
01:03:37,610 --> 01:03:55,719
Good.

599
01:03:55,719 --> 01:04:00,949
I'm coming.

600
01:04:00,949 --> 01:04:02,949
What do you think I'm doing?

601
01:04:02,949 --> 01:04:05,769
It's over. We win.

602
01:04:05,769 --> 01:04:09,610
My eyes flashed.

603
01:04:09,610 --> 01:04:12,550
Okay, bus.

604
01:04:12,550 --> 01:04:16,579
Still alive.

605
01:04:16,579 --> 01:04:27,340
Still alive.

606
01:04:27,340 --> 01:04:29,340
Alright, let's move.

607
01:04:29,340 --> 01:04:31,340
Go into the subway.

608
01:04:31,340 --> 01:04:35,239
Go into the subway

609
01:04:35,239 --> 01:04:37,239
is probably the idea.

610
01:04:37,239 --> 01:04:44,329
My ear is itchy.

611
01:04:44,329 --> 01:04:49,190
Try to break the game.

612
01:04:49,190 --> 01:05:01,800
Well, I care about throwing a bus

613
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:03,800
into the ocean, so

614
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:05,800
I mean, that's a given.

615
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:15,849
This mission is long.

616
01:05:27,710 --> 01:05:29,710
That's not a bad guy.

617
01:05:34,530 --> 01:05:38,239
Die!

618
01:05:38,239 --> 01:05:40,239
All the way down here. Get out of here.

619
01:05:40,239 --> 01:05:42,239
Where the fuck are these super mutants

620
01:05:42,239 --> 01:05:46,719
even coming from?

621
01:05:46,719 --> 01:05:48,719
That guy just fucked himself up.

622
01:05:52,139 --> 01:05:55,780
He's dead. He's dead.

623
01:05:55,780 --> 01:06:00,710
Why did he turn into

624
01:06:00,710 --> 01:06:02,710
seven other smaller

625
01:06:02,710 --> 01:06:26,070
cars? That guy was driving

626
01:06:26,070 --> 01:06:28,070
backwards faster than you could

627
01:06:28,070 --> 01:06:33,320
drive forwards.

628
01:06:33,320 --> 01:07:21,769
There's so many cabs.

629
01:07:21,769 --> 01:07:23,769
Now we can fucking stop.

630
01:07:23,769 --> 01:07:29,659
What do we got? Six hours?

631
01:07:29,659 --> 01:07:48,599
Not sure when I could start right now

632
01:07:48,599 --> 01:07:50,599
that wouldn't take at least four hours.

633
01:07:50,599 --> 01:08:19,189
Yeah, I'll see you tomorrow.

634
01:08:19,189 --> 01:08:27,510
I'll see you tomorrow. And then I'll see you Sunday too.

635
01:08:27,510 --> 01:08:35,880
What are we doing tomorrow?

636
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:38,250
That's a really good...I kind of need to look at what

637
01:08:38,250 --> 01:08:40,250
I need to...I have to look at what I have.

638
01:08:40,250 --> 01:08:42,810
Wait, this is a new big thing to grab.

639
01:08:42,810 --> 01:08:47,800
I need to look at what I got.

640
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:49,800
A real wink? It's been a while since we had one.

641
01:08:49,800 --> 01:08:54,920
Community content night is Sunday.

642
01:08:54,920 --> 01:08:57,420
We'll be live tomorrow.

643
01:08:57,420 --> 01:08:59,420
And then...I want to do

644
01:08:59,420 --> 01:09:01,420
something I can do in one stream.

645
01:09:01,420 --> 01:09:03,420
I don't know if I want to do...I think I want to move away from like the

646
01:09:03,420 --> 01:09:08,409
GUI in the GameCube for a little while.

647
01:09:08,409 --> 01:09:10,409
I have a lot of stuff. So I gotta figure out

648
01:09:10,409 --> 01:09:20,579
what I want to do. Hulk.

649
01:09:20,579 --> 01:09:22,949
Well, the good one

650
01:09:22,949 --> 01:09:24,949
won't be here for at least a couple days.

651
01:09:24,949 --> 01:09:29,369
Yeah, we'll figure it out.

652
01:09:29,369 --> 01:09:31,369
We'll do something. And then

653
01:09:31,369 --> 01:09:33,369
the community content night is Sunday.

654
01:09:33,369 --> 01:09:35,369
Also the last day for winks. We're gonna do

655
01:09:35,369 --> 01:09:37,369
a wink apocalypse.

656
01:09:37,369 --> 01:09:40,060
So, we'll see you tomorrow.

657
01:09:40,060 --> 01:09:53,560
Putting the Wiimote down.

658
01:09:53,560 --> 01:09:58,340
Wink. I got it.

659
01:09:58,340 --> 01:10:00,579
Putting down the Wiimote. And we're gonna end

660
01:10:00,579 --> 01:10:03,210
the stream here. I'm gonna stick around. We'll do the bits

661
01:10:03,210 --> 01:10:05,380
and everything. We'll hang out. But

662
01:10:05,380 --> 01:10:08,010
reliably, it's

663
01:10:08,010 --> 01:10:10,010
not very much I think I would want to start that

664
01:10:10,010 --> 01:10:12,010
would take less than 30 to 40 minutes.

665
01:10:12,010 --> 01:10:14,010
And if we're gonna do that anyways, if I'm just gonna

666
01:10:14,010 --> 01:10:16,010
stream for like 31 minutes, might as well just do

667
01:10:16,010 --> 01:10:18,010
the 30 to 40 minute end of the stream.

668
01:10:18,010 --> 01:10:20,380
And start fresh tomorrow

669
01:10:20,380 --> 01:10:22,380
I'm gonna do something that can take

670
01:10:22,380 --> 01:10:27,560
6 plus hours to do.

671
01:10:27,560 --> 01:10:29,560
Did I finish Mario Sunshine?

672
01:10:29,560 --> 01:10:33,140
I did. Play Mario Odyssey.

673
01:10:33,140 --> 01:10:36,899
I probably will.

674
01:10:36,899 --> 01:10:41,899
I probably will. Well, thanks for joining me.

675
01:10:41,899 --> 01:10:49,430
I'll see you tomorrow. Take care guys.

676
01:10:49,430 --> 01:10:55,579
Get the music going.

677
01:10:55,579 --> 01:11:02,300
Turn it up a little bit.

678
01:11:02,300 --> 01:11:04,300
Do a Frogger stream.

679
01:11:04,300 --> 01:11:07,689
Remember, if you just sit there

680
01:11:07,689 --> 01:11:09,689
motionless for 16 hours, why don't you

681
01:11:09,689 --> 01:11:13,270
just keep the cam on?

682
01:11:13,270 --> 01:11:15,270
Yeah, just keep the camera on.

683
01:11:15,270 --> 01:11:19,560
Stream 24x7.

684
01:11:19,560 --> 01:11:21,930
But let's go back to earlier.

685
01:11:21,930 --> 01:11:23,930
We had 5 community subs from Never

686
01:11:23,930 --> 01:11:25,930
Trust Nanners. I think that was before the stream even

687
01:11:25,930 --> 01:11:28,619
started. So thanks for that.

688
01:11:28,619 --> 01:11:32,329
Bulbaswag, thanks for the 500 bits.

689
01:11:32,329 --> 01:11:34,329
I'm so happy I got to derail with

690
01:11:34,329 --> 01:11:36,329
this neat glitch.

691
01:11:36,329 --> 01:11:38,329
Yeah, that was at least

692
01:11:38,329 --> 01:11:40,890
30 to 40 minutes

693
01:11:40,890 --> 01:11:43,130
of stream time. Was that

694
01:11:43,130 --> 01:11:45,939
whole scenario.

695
01:11:45,939 --> 01:11:47,939
And I didn't even use it. Just did it the regular way.

696
01:11:47,939 --> 01:11:54,729
I'm going to buy Hulk Ultimate

697
01:11:54,729 --> 01:11:57,159
Destruction and get it here as soon as

698
01:11:57,159 --> 01:12:00,039
possible. Don't worry.

699
01:12:00,039 --> 01:12:02,539
If I bought the wrong game, I'd make mistakes.

700
01:12:02,539 --> 01:12:05,100
It's okay.

701
01:12:05,100 --> 01:12:07,100
Jaxx with a bunch of X's thanks for the 500

702
01:12:07,100 --> 01:12:09,100
bits. Jeremy, long time listener, first time caller.

703
01:12:09,100 --> 01:12:11,100
Hope I did this right. Thanks for doing the Mario.

704
01:12:11,100 --> 01:12:13,340
It was really fun.

705
01:12:13,340 --> 01:12:15,829
Glad I finally got to experience

706
01:12:15,829 --> 01:12:19,350
the

707
01:12:19,350 --> 01:12:21,350
mainline Mario game

708
01:12:21,350 --> 01:12:23,350
for the Gamecube. I didn't play it.

709
01:12:23,350 --> 01:12:29,220
Thanks a lot. Cold Warhol

710
01:12:29,220 --> 01:12:31,220
gave $20, 2000 bits

711
01:12:31,220 --> 01:12:33,590
from Cold Warhol. Thanks for the 20 bucks.

712
01:12:33,590 --> 01:12:36,149
Appreciate it. Howdy, Jeremy. Hope you're doing

713
01:12:36,149 --> 01:12:38,149
well. Today's my 21st birthday, which means I'm

714
01:12:38,149 --> 01:12:40,149
finally legally old enough to watch your streams.

715
01:12:40,149 --> 01:12:42,149
Here's some of that birthday

716
01:12:42,149 --> 01:12:44,149
card money for your own, for

717
01:12:44,149 --> 01:12:47,930
your e-clown services.

718
01:12:47,930 --> 01:12:49,930
Our rated movie is 17, isn't it?

719
01:12:49,930 --> 01:12:59,640
What is PG-13?

720
01:12:59,640 --> 01:13:01,640
What if PG-13 was 16 or something?

721
01:13:01,640 --> 01:13:11,050
That would make no sense. It would just be PG-16.

722
01:13:11,050 --> 01:13:15,020
But happy birthday,

723
01:13:15,020 --> 01:13:17,020
Cold Warhol. Thanks for the 20 bucks.

724
01:13:17,020 --> 01:13:25,319
Appreciate it. Peaceful

725
01:13:25,319 --> 01:13:27,319
Haley. Thanks for the 250, Jeremy. Hope you liked

726
01:13:27,319 --> 01:13:29,319
the game so far. I was wondering, which are your favorite

727
01:13:29,319 --> 01:13:31,319
worlds, so far at least?

728
01:13:31,319 --> 01:13:33,319
Mine is Serena Beach.

729
01:13:33,319 --> 01:13:35,319
My least favorite is probably Noki Bay

730
01:13:35,319 --> 01:13:37,319
because it gets annoying. Also, yeah, the only

731
01:13:37,319 --> 01:13:39,319
complaint I have on this game is the camera.

732
01:13:39,319 --> 01:13:41,319
The best world

733
01:13:41,319 --> 01:13:43,319
in Mario Sunshine was

734
01:13:43,319 --> 01:13:49,779
I think I like that

735
01:13:49,779 --> 01:13:55,289
first world. Either the first

736
01:13:55,289 --> 01:13:57,289
world or

737
01:13:57,289 --> 01:14:01,699
yeah, probably the first world.

738
01:14:01,699 --> 01:14:03,699
That first introduction world I think is really

739
01:14:03,699 --> 01:14:06,460
nice. I like the

740
01:14:06,460 --> 01:14:08,460
lake. I like the big windmill.

741
01:14:08,460 --> 01:14:10,460
That's probably where I would like the most.

742
01:14:10,460 --> 01:14:12,460
Bianco Hills, yeah.

743
01:14:12,460 --> 01:14:16,810
That one reminded me the most of

744
01:14:16,810 --> 01:14:18,810
Mario 64.

745
01:14:18,810 --> 01:14:20,810
It was a very Mario 64-esque

746
01:14:20,810 --> 01:14:27,779
level.

747
01:14:27,779 --> 01:14:29,779
Are you excited for Resident Evil 3? Yep. I mean, Resident Evil 2

748
01:14:29,779 --> 01:14:31,779
I thought was the best game that came out last year, so I

749
01:14:31,779 --> 01:14:33,779
definitely can't wait for the next in

750
01:14:33,779 --> 01:14:43,260
the series to be remade. What about

751
01:14:43,260 --> 01:14:45,260
the Chalksters? Oh, that wasn't a world.

752
01:14:45,260 --> 01:14:47,260
That was a secret level.

753
01:14:47,260 --> 01:14:51,989
Thanks a lot, Haley. I thought it was

754
01:14:51,989 --> 01:14:54,489
great. We had five

755
01:14:54,489 --> 01:14:56,489
community subs from Oath Horse and

756
01:14:56,489 --> 01:14:58,489
2,000 bits

757
01:14:58,489 --> 01:15:00,979
from Oath Horse as well.

758
01:15:00,979 --> 01:15:02,979
So thank you, Oath Horse, for your $20 and

759
01:15:02,979 --> 01:15:06,060
five community subs. Back

760
01:15:06,060 --> 01:15:08,060
to back. And they say awesome Mario

761
01:15:08,060 --> 01:15:10,060
streams when my daughter had introduced

762
01:15:10,060 --> 01:15:12,060
me to you and your content was a baby.

763
01:15:12,060 --> 01:15:14,060
She watched her cousin playing

764
01:15:14,060 --> 01:15:16,060
this game and when he collected a shine

765
01:15:16,060 --> 01:15:18,060
she threw up her

766
01:15:18,060 --> 01:15:20,060
fat baby arms and yelled

767
01:15:20,060 --> 01:15:22,060
Woo Cha Chao.

768
01:15:22,060 --> 01:15:24,359
It's a family

769
01:15:24,359 --> 01:15:28,199
meme to this day.

770
01:15:28,199 --> 01:15:31,850
Woo Cha Chao. If you get a

771
01:15:31,850 --> 01:15:33,850
chance, our family would love to hear one from

772
01:15:33,850 --> 01:15:38,460
you. Woo Cha Chao.

773
01:15:38,460 --> 01:15:41,899
Did I do it right?

774
01:15:41,899 --> 01:15:43,899
This is a sitcom plot line.

775
01:15:43,899 --> 01:15:51,960
Nobody does better

776
01:15:51,960 --> 01:15:53,960
gaming-related improv and sketch comedy

777
01:15:53,960 --> 01:15:55,960
than you do. That's very nice of you.

778
01:15:55,960 --> 01:15:59,029
Huge fans and love your content.

779
01:15:59,029 --> 01:16:01,029
I told you there was kids watching. That's why

780
01:16:01,029 --> 01:16:04,039
I had to be careful today.

781
01:16:04,039 --> 01:16:06,039
I tried to not swear as much, but I

782
01:16:06,039 --> 01:16:08,039
think I've removed

783
01:16:08,039 --> 01:16:10,859
two or three swears today.

784
01:16:10,859 --> 01:16:12,859
If I typically swear four to five thousand

785
01:16:12,859 --> 01:16:14,859
times a stream, I took

786
01:16:14,859 --> 01:16:16,859
maybe

787
01:16:16,859 --> 01:16:19,159
0.2%. I'm not a kid.

788
01:16:19,159 --> 01:16:21,159
You're not a kid, but

789
01:16:21,159 --> 01:16:23,159
kids probably watching. There were kids potentially

790
01:16:23,159 --> 01:16:35,829
in the audience.

791
01:16:35,829 --> 01:16:37,829
But thanks for the

792
01:16:37,829 --> 01:16:39,829
big drop and the community subs.

793
01:16:39,829 --> 01:16:42,390
Appreciate that. Thank you.

794
01:16:42,390 --> 01:16:44,390
Captain Sharkbait gave five community

795
01:16:44,390 --> 01:16:46,390
subs, but the difference between these five

796
01:16:46,390 --> 01:16:48,390
community subs and

797
01:16:48,390 --> 01:16:50,390
standard community subs is these five

798
01:16:50,390 --> 01:16:52,890
were tier three. They gave

799
01:16:52,890 --> 01:16:54,890
five tier three community

800
01:16:54,890 --> 01:16:56,890
subs, which are $25

801
01:16:56,890 --> 01:16:59,380
each. Aren't they?

802
01:16:59,380 --> 01:17:01,380
How much are they? $24.99, right?

803
01:17:01,380 --> 01:17:04,260
Wait, how much are they?

804
01:17:04,260 --> 01:17:12,119
Okay, that's expensive.

805
01:17:12,119 --> 01:17:14,119
Five tier three subs.

806
01:17:14,119 --> 01:17:16,939
That's $125 in subs.

807
01:17:16,939 --> 01:17:20,069
So that's insane.

808
01:17:20,069 --> 01:17:25,560
Thank you, Captain Sharkbait.

809
01:17:25,560 --> 01:17:27,560
There's not even a tier three emote.

810
01:17:27,560 --> 01:17:30,310
Do I still have 10k subs? No, I do

811
01:17:30,310 --> 01:17:35,689
not. Hitting it and crossing it

812
01:17:35,689 --> 01:17:37,689
was a fucking crazy thing.

813
01:17:37,689 --> 01:17:41,720
I could never expect

814
01:17:41,720 --> 01:17:43,720
to keep 10,000

815
01:17:43,720 --> 01:17:45,720
fucking subs on this channel.

816
01:17:45,720 --> 01:17:47,720
That is an unbelievable

817
01:17:47,720 --> 01:17:50,220
number.

818
01:17:50,220 --> 01:17:52,970
That's alright.

819
01:17:52,970 --> 01:18:03,340
That does not bother me.

820
01:18:03,340 --> 01:18:05,340
But thank you, Captain Sharkbait, for your

821
01:18:05,340 --> 01:18:07,340
ridiculous tier three subs.

822
01:18:07,340 --> 01:18:09,340
Hoj, fast thanks for the 500 bits. They just

823
01:18:09,340 --> 01:18:11,340
say hype. I must have done something

824
01:18:11,340 --> 01:18:13,340
cool. Thank you, HojFest.

825
01:18:13,340 --> 01:18:16,729
SticksRenegade250

826
01:18:16,729 --> 01:18:18,729
HeyiiGerma, I'm five.

827
01:18:18,729 --> 01:18:20,729
What's a 69?

828
01:18:20,729 --> 01:18:28,069
It's

829
01:18:28,069 --> 01:18:30,069
a 69 is

830
01:18:30,069 --> 01:18:32,069
the way to write out

831
01:18:32,069 --> 01:18:34,069
how a battery connects.

832
01:18:34,069 --> 01:18:38,170
How some of your devices work.

833
01:18:38,170 --> 01:18:40,170
That's what they mean. That's why they think it's a cool number.

834
01:18:40,170 --> 01:18:57,579
Thanks for the 250, just in case you're curious.

835
01:18:57,579 --> 01:18:59,579
BraptonB

836
01:18:59,579 --> 01:19:01,579
Thanks for the five community subs, Brapton.

837
01:19:01,579 --> 01:19:03,880
Earlier today.

838
01:19:03,880 --> 01:19:06,180
WembleyTTV

839
01:19:06,180 --> 01:19:09,300
250

840
01:19:09,300 --> 01:19:11,300
Hey, Germa, I took into account

841
01:19:11,300 --> 01:19:13,300
what you said.

842
01:19:13,300 --> 01:19:15,300
I did dream about you and Spongebob crossing swords.

843
01:19:15,300 --> 01:19:17,300
You made it even worse.

844
01:19:17,300 --> 01:19:19,300
I still got you naked with

845
01:19:19,300 --> 01:19:21,300
Defoe while you and Spongebob

846
01:19:21,300 --> 01:19:23,300
you know, nevermind that. Thanks for the help.

847
01:19:23,300 --> 01:19:25,859
What? I still got

848
01:19:25,859 --> 01:19:29,380
naked?

849
01:19:29,380 --> 01:19:40,840
Why are we naked? Wait.

850
01:19:40,840 --> 01:19:42,840
PeacefulHailey, thanks for the 250. Germa, please let

851
01:19:42,840 --> 01:19:45,779
me simp you.

852
01:19:45,779 --> 01:19:51,029
What does that mean?

853
01:19:51,029 --> 01:20:02,039
What does that mean? Turn the stream

854
01:20:02,039 --> 01:20:06,460
off now.

855
01:20:06,460 --> 01:20:08,460
Thank you. I don't

856
01:20:08,460 --> 01:20:13,260
know what that is. KeithKingKrimz

857
01:20:13,260 --> 01:20:15,260
Thanks for the 250. Hey, Germa, this is Keith.

858
01:20:15,260 --> 01:20:17,260
The NPC from The Bachelor. I deserved

859
01:20:17,260 --> 01:20:19,260
that rose, not you, fucker.

860
01:20:19,260 --> 01:20:22,199
Well, you didn't get enough hearts.

861
01:20:22,199 --> 01:20:27,770
I did.

862
01:20:27,770 --> 01:20:29,770
YharnamTouristShop, thanks for the

863
01:20:29,770 --> 01:20:31,770
300 bits.

864
01:20:31,770 --> 01:20:33,770
Germa, how much do I have to pay you to stop playing

865
01:20:33,770 --> 01:20:35,770
this bachelor game and come beat

866
01:20:35,770 --> 01:20:37,770
Orphan of Kos

867
01:20:37,770 --> 01:20:39,770
with me? Name your price.

868
01:20:39,770 --> 01:20:42,390
Oh, there is

869
01:20:42,390 --> 01:20:44,390
none. Price is

870
01:20:44,390 --> 01:20:46,390
n-slash-a, not applicable.

871
01:20:46,390 --> 01:20:56,630
Hey, many rabbits, thanks for the 300

872
01:20:56,630 --> 01:20:58,630
bits. In the span of about three weeks, I lost my job

873
01:20:58,630 --> 01:21:00,630
and now I'm losing my home. That's

874
01:21:00,630 --> 01:21:03,260
terrible. Sorry to hear

875
01:21:03,260 --> 01:21:05,560
that. Meanwhile, I'm watching your

876
01:21:05,560 --> 01:21:07,560
JumpKingBots and there's something kind of therapeutic

877
01:21:07,560 --> 01:21:09,560
about watching you fail so intensely

878
01:21:09,560 --> 01:21:11,560
over and over again while I'm dealing with this.

879
01:21:11,560 --> 01:21:15,720
Love you, 5ever.

880
01:21:15,720 --> 01:21:17,720
I don't know your exact scenario, but that's

881
01:21:17,720 --> 01:21:20,859
that sounds fucking horrible.

882
01:21:20,859 --> 01:21:23,989
Hopefully you get that figured out.

883
01:21:23,989 --> 01:21:31,220
I cannot imagine something like that happening.

884
01:21:31,220 --> 01:21:39,220
Yeah, hope everything turns out

885
01:21:39,220 --> 01:21:48,439
okay. Thanks for the $3

886
01:21:48,439 --> 01:21:59,109
and good luck.

887
01:21:59,109 --> 01:22:01,109
We also had TheManWithTheBabyHands

888
01:22:01,109 --> 01:22:04,500
for 1000 bits

889
01:22:04,500 --> 01:22:06,500
$10 teddy bear streamer

890
01:22:06,500 --> 01:22:09,380
No, I'm not a teddy bear. I'm not a teddy bear.

891
01:22:09,380 --> 01:22:18,899
Let me tell you, I'm a bull.

892
01:22:18,899 --> 01:22:20,899
What's the world's sleepiest animal?

893
01:22:20,899 --> 01:22:26,220
Okay, for like one hour a day

894
01:22:26,220 --> 01:22:29,479
I'm a bull.

895
01:22:29,479 --> 01:22:31,479
And then for 23 more hours I'm a koala.

896
01:22:31,479 --> 01:22:34,039
That's like

897
01:22:34,039 --> 01:22:36,409
two to three hours I'm a bull.

898
01:22:36,409 --> 01:22:38,409
For 22 to 21 hours a day

899
01:22:38,409 --> 01:22:41,159
I'm a koala. What does that make me?

900
01:22:41,159 --> 01:22:53,510
An idiot.

901
01:22:53,510 --> 01:22:57,609
Hey

902
01:22:57,609 --> 01:22:59,609
Lazy Luke, thanks for the 250.

903
01:22:59,609 --> 01:23:01,609
Last stream we talked about something like this.

904
01:23:01,609 --> 01:23:03,609
So I made a page which randomly

905
01:23:03,609 --> 01:23:05,609
picks a moment out of about

906
01:23:05,609 --> 01:23:07,609
3200 hours of archived streams

907
01:23:07,609 --> 01:23:09,609
and main channeled videos.

908
01:23:09,609 --> 01:23:11,609
Are you kidding me? You did this in one day?

909
01:23:11,609 --> 01:23:13,609
Click the button at the top

910
01:23:13,609 --> 01:23:15,609
center to play a random moment out of

911
01:23:15,609 --> 01:23:17,609
3200 hours of Jerma videos

912
01:23:17,609 --> 01:23:20,619
and streams.

913
01:23:20,619 --> 01:23:22,619
You fucking legend.

914
01:23:22,619 --> 01:23:24,619
You are legendary. Are you serious?

915
01:23:24,619 --> 01:23:26,920
You actually did this?

916
01:23:26,920 --> 01:23:34,920
Oh my god.

917
01:23:34,920 --> 01:23:38,310
Unfucking believable.

918
01:23:38,310 --> 01:23:41,770
It works. This is

919
01:23:41,770 --> 01:23:44,140
unbelievable. This is amazing.

920
01:23:44,140 --> 01:23:49,449
Holy shit.

921
01:23:49,449 --> 01:23:51,939
Well, okay.

922
01:23:51,939 --> 01:23:53,939
So for those that have need context here

923
01:23:53,939 --> 01:23:56,500
talked about how funny it would be

924
01:23:56,500 --> 01:23:58,500
on a stream if

925
01:23:58,500 --> 01:24:00,939
we took every

926
01:24:00,939 --> 01:24:02,939
stream I've ever done.

927
01:24:02,939 --> 01:24:04,939
Or at least the ones that are available.

928
01:24:04,939 --> 01:24:06,939
The archive channel has 80

929
01:24:06,939 --> 01:24:08,939
to 90% or so of every

930
01:24:08,939 --> 01:24:11,560
stream I've ever done. And every

931
01:24:11,560 --> 01:24:14,180
10 minutes we change

932
01:24:14,180 --> 01:24:16,180
to a random stream

933
01:24:16,180 --> 01:24:18,180
at a random time. And watch

934
01:24:18,180 --> 01:24:28,039
for 10 minutes and see what happens.

935
01:24:28,039 --> 01:24:35,140
That would be pretty fun.

936
01:24:35,140 --> 01:24:37,899
Compact duration.

937
01:24:37,899 --> 01:24:39,899
Do that tomorrow.

938
01:24:39,899 --> 01:24:41,899
I mean, it's

939
01:24:41,899 --> 01:24:46,569
ready to use.

940
01:24:46,569 --> 01:24:48,569
That's unbelievable. I did not think

941
01:24:48,569 --> 01:24:50,569
this was going to be ready to use as of now.

942
01:24:50,569 --> 01:24:56,140
Easy content.

943
01:24:56,140 --> 01:24:58,140
Easy content.

944
01:24:58,140 --> 01:25:00,699
Hold on. Let me think about this.

945
01:25:00,699 --> 01:25:04,859
Do it now. No, no, no, no, no.

946
01:25:04,859 --> 01:25:06,859
We have to sit there. We have to be ready for this.

947
01:25:06,859 --> 01:25:08,859
I don't want to do one right now.

948
01:25:08,859 --> 01:25:14,489
I don't want to give that away.

949
01:25:14,489 --> 01:25:19,930
Lazy Luke. Holy shit.

950
01:25:19,930 --> 01:25:21,930
Lazy Luke, what's your Discord name? What's your name on Discord?

951
01:25:21,930 --> 01:25:25,060
Are you using Lazy Luke

952
01:25:25,060 --> 01:25:27,060
on Discord?

953
01:25:27,060 --> 01:25:37,939
Do I have you on Discord?

954
01:25:37,939 --> 01:25:39,939
Alright, somebody get a hold of that guy.

955
01:25:39,939 --> 01:25:41,939
One of the mods. Get a hold of Lazy Luke.

956
01:25:41,939 --> 01:25:43,939
I want to talk to Lazy Luke.

957
01:25:43,939 --> 01:25:48,680
One on one.

958
01:25:48,680 --> 01:25:50,680
What? No, I...

959
01:25:50,680 --> 01:25:55,539
No! And I'll tell you a couple of reasons

960
01:25:55,539 --> 01:25:58,170
why. First,

961
01:25:58,170 --> 01:26:00,170
very importantly,

962
01:26:00,170 --> 01:26:02,170
Lazy Luke has made

963
01:26:02,170 --> 01:26:04,170
a better stream dashboard

964
01:26:04,170 --> 01:26:07,350
than all the ones

965
01:26:07,350 --> 01:26:12,539
that are currently available.

966
01:26:12,539 --> 01:26:14,779
It's five times better than Streamlabs.

967
01:26:14,779 --> 01:26:19,770
And they've also

968
01:26:19,770 --> 01:26:21,770
got a couple of the little website things.

969
01:26:21,770 --> 01:26:23,770
I want to have a couple

970
01:26:23,770 --> 01:26:25,770
of words with Lazy Luke

971
01:26:25,770 --> 01:26:34,020
about some stuff. Yeah, I mean,

972
01:26:34,020 --> 01:26:40,039
we're doing this too.

973
01:26:40,039 --> 01:26:44,649
This sounds ominous.

974
01:26:44,649 --> 01:26:46,649
Ominous.

975
01:26:46,649 --> 01:26:48,649
What's their exact username?

976
01:26:48,649 --> 01:27:01,449
They sent their info. Okay, cool.

977
01:27:01,449 --> 01:27:07,189
There we go.

978
01:27:07,189 --> 01:27:09,189
The newest VIP of the channel is Lazy Luke.

979
01:27:09,189 --> 01:27:12,710
I mean, this is so good.

980
01:27:12,710 --> 01:27:14,710
We talked about this

981
01:27:14,710 --> 01:27:18,039
just off the cuff.

982
01:27:18,039 --> 01:27:20,039
Randomly. Yesterday.

983
01:27:20,039 --> 01:27:22,039
And it's already done and ready to be used?

984
01:27:22,039 --> 01:27:24,039
That's unfucking believable.

985
01:27:24,039 --> 01:27:26,039
Talk to me on Discord. We've got some stuff to talk about.

986
01:27:26,039 --> 01:27:36,460
I'll put you up in the next day or two.

987
01:27:36,460 --> 01:27:39,140
Anyways, we have...

988
01:27:39,140 --> 01:27:49,050
Where are we?

989
01:27:49,050 --> 01:27:51,050
We have Leroy Brown for $5.

990
01:27:51,050 --> 01:27:53,050
Jerma, this stream has been amazing.

991
01:27:53,050 --> 01:27:55,050
I love this stream so much that I made a JPG

992
01:27:55,050 --> 01:27:59,720
to remember it by.

993
01:27:59,720 --> 01:28:08,489
Wait, why am I green?

994
01:28:08,489 --> 01:28:20,460
Why am I green in this picture?

995
01:28:20,460 --> 01:28:29,100
Can you see it? Wait, what's going on?

996
01:28:29,100 --> 01:28:35,560
Oh, sorry.

997
01:28:35,560 --> 01:28:40,420
Oh, cause the Hulk.

998
01:28:40,420 --> 01:28:42,420
Alright. What am I thinking of the

999
01:28:42,420 --> 01:28:52,729
slide level?

1000
01:28:52,729 --> 01:28:54,729
He thought I was a Teletubby.

1001
01:28:54,729 --> 01:28:56,729
Thank you

1002
01:28:56,729 --> 01:28:58,899
for the $5 Leroy. Appreciate it.

1003
01:28:58,899 --> 01:29:00,899
Zaru, thanks for the 300 bits.

1004
01:29:00,899 --> 01:29:02,899
My friends and I occasionally play Happy Rock.

1005
01:29:02,899 --> 01:29:04,899
And reminds you...

1006
01:29:04,899 --> 01:29:06,899
Reminds me of your hilarious

1007
01:29:06,899 --> 01:29:08,899
Grab That Auto 5 video and many more.

1008
01:29:08,899 --> 01:29:10,899
Thanks for being a hilarious entertainer

1009
01:29:10,899 --> 01:29:12,899
and genuine human being.

1010
01:29:12,899 --> 01:29:15,850
Oh, thank you.

1011
01:29:15,850 --> 01:29:20,779
Happy Rock. Thank you, Zaru.

1012
01:29:20,779 --> 01:29:22,779
Zaru. For the $5.

1013
01:29:22,779 --> 01:29:24,779
Re dollars.

1014
01:29:24,779 --> 01:29:26,779
The nibs. Thanks for the $5.

1015
01:29:26,779 --> 01:29:28,779
Can you wish my friend Justin

1016
01:29:28,779 --> 01:29:30,779
a happy birthday? Sure.

1017
01:29:30,779 --> 01:29:32,779
Happy birthday, Justin.

1018
01:29:32,779 --> 01:29:35,270
From me, Jerma985.

1019
01:29:35,270 --> 01:29:39,430
I hope you have

1020
01:29:39,430 --> 01:29:41,430
a healthy day

1021
01:29:41,430 --> 01:29:43,430
and things look great.

1022
01:29:43,430 --> 01:29:45,859
And I hope that you get cool.

1023
01:29:45,859 --> 01:29:49,579
Don't overdo it. Don't overdo it.

1024
01:29:49,579 --> 01:29:51,579
Yeah, this is turning into

1025
01:29:51,579 --> 01:29:53,579
a cameo.com video.

1026
01:29:53,579 --> 01:29:55,579
Yeah, sorry about that. Happy birthday, Justin.

1027
01:29:55,579 --> 01:30:06,329
Thanks for the $5.

1028
01:30:06,329 --> 01:30:12,409
Hunter Johnson.

1029
01:30:12,409 --> 01:30:14,409
Thanks for the $5. Can't wait for you to see my video

1030
01:30:14,409 --> 01:30:16,409
for Community Content Night.

1031
01:30:16,409 --> 01:30:21,380
Neither can I. 500 bits.

1032
01:30:21,380 --> 01:30:24,970
Jay Bong. Thanks for the $2.50.

1033
01:30:24,970 --> 01:30:26,970
Hey man, is your body ready for VR yet?

1034
01:30:26,970 --> 01:30:28,970
Or are you going to have to wear your boomer brace for a few more weeks?

1035
01:30:28,970 --> 01:30:30,970
I can't wait for you to play Boneworks

1036
01:30:30,970 --> 01:30:32,970
and Half-Life Alex.

1037
01:30:32,970 --> 01:30:34,970
Maybe invest in those index controllers.

1038
01:30:34,970 --> 01:30:38,100
Yeah, we talked about this in

1039
01:30:38,100 --> 01:30:40,100
pre-stream chat a little bit today, but

1040
01:30:40,100 --> 01:30:42,470
anything that requires

1041
01:30:42,470 --> 01:30:45,350
tilting, rotating,

1042
01:30:45,350 --> 01:30:47,350
and moving around and jumping

1043
01:30:47,350 --> 01:30:50,229
around, I could do it for

1044
01:30:50,229 --> 01:30:52,229
20 minutes or 30 minutes

1045
01:30:52,229 --> 01:30:54,470
or so, but it's really the

1046
01:30:54,470 --> 01:30:56,470
tilting and the leaning and the move

1047
01:30:56,470 --> 01:30:58,470
with that thing on my head

1048
01:30:58,470 --> 01:31:00,470
adding weight

1049
01:31:00,470 --> 01:31:02,470
to kind of my

1050
01:31:02,470 --> 01:31:04,470
cervical, whatever it is, spine,

1051
01:31:04,470 --> 01:31:06,470
whatever it is, the top part of your spine,

1052
01:31:06,470 --> 01:31:09,479
it might not be a great

1053
01:31:09,479 --> 01:31:14,340
idea. And

1054
01:31:14,340 --> 01:31:16,340
I kind of have to just try to

1055
01:31:16,340 --> 01:31:18,340
take care of this

1056
01:31:18,340 --> 01:31:24,229
and do it as best as I can.

1057
01:31:24,229 --> 01:31:29,159
But, cervical spine.

1058
01:31:29,159 --> 01:31:33,640
The cervical spine is where your

1059
01:31:33,640 --> 01:31:35,640
neck, that's the part, that's the spine where

1060
01:31:35,640 --> 01:31:37,640
your neck is, it's your neck bones.

1061
01:31:37,640 --> 01:31:45,109
What are you guys talking about?

1062
01:31:45,109 --> 01:31:49,909
What did you think I was talking about?

1063
01:31:49,909 --> 01:31:51,909
Cerebral? No, it's your

1064
01:31:51,909 --> 01:31:57,989
cervical spine.

1065
01:31:57,989 --> 01:31:59,989
You guys, what are you on about?

1066
01:31:59,989 --> 01:32:01,989
But, uh, Grain Screen

1067
01:32:01,989 --> 01:32:03,989
Part 2 is just

1068
01:32:03,989 --> 01:32:05,989
on indefinite hold.

1069
01:32:05,989 --> 01:32:07,989
Doing extensive VR is on

1070
01:32:07,989 --> 01:32:09,989
hold. I still have Connect

1071
01:32:09,989 --> 01:32:11,989
Games to play that, but I'm like, I can't

1072
01:32:11,989 --> 01:32:13,989
like run around my room and shit like I

1073
01:32:13,989 --> 01:32:15,989
just can't right now. That's the unfortunate

1074
01:32:15,989 --> 01:32:17,989
truth, they all have to be on indefinite hold

1075
01:32:17,989 --> 01:32:19,989
until

1076
01:32:19,989 --> 01:32:21,989
I have a real good permanent

1077
01:32:21,989 --> 01:32:23,989
solution for what's going on.

1078
01:32:23,989 --> 01:32:25,989
Right now it's physical therapy, and if

1079
01:32:25,989 --> 01:32:27,989
physical therapy doesn't work over the next

1080
01:32:27,989 --> 01:32:29,989
month or two, then I

1081
01:32:29,989 --> 01:32:31,989
have to go get an intercostal nerve block

1082
01:32:31,989 --> 01:32:33,989
injection into my body.

1083
01:32:33,989 --> 01:32:36,359
So, I'm sure

1084
01:32:36,359 --> 01:32:38,359
I'll probably be fine after that,

1085
01:32:38,359 --> 01:32:40,359
but that has to happen, but I don't want to do it yet.

1086
01:32:40,359 --> 01:32:46,890
That was a big word,

1087
01:32:46,890 --> 01:32:48,890
yeah, it was a very big word.

1088
01:32:48,890 --> 01:32:55,859
So, can't really do a whole lot of movement.

1089
01:32:55,859 --> 01:32:58,300
I'm not

1090
01:32:58,300 --> 01:33:00,300
hopefully not making a sound like a

1091
01:33:00,300 --> 01:33:02,300
I can't move like oil, oil

1092
01:33:02,300 --> 01:33:04,300
like

1093
01:33:04,300 --> 01:33:06,300
No, no, it's not like that,

1094
01:33:06,300 --> 01:33:08,300
but I don't want to aggravate anything.

1095
01:33:08,300 --> 01:33:10,300
Sudden movements can be like

1096
01:33:10,300 --> 01:33:12,729
ooh, ow, and

1097
01:33:12,729 --> 01:33:14,729
obviously if I'm doing physical therapy, I don't want to go to

1098
01:33:14,729 --> 01:33:16,729
my physical therapist and be like, oh hey, yeah

1099
01:33:16,729 --> 01:33:18,729
my like chest and back hurt really

1100
01:33:18,729 --> 01:33:20,729
bad today. I did a bunch of VR shit

1101
01:33:20,729 --> 01:33:22,729
and was like spinning around in circles.

1102
01:33:22,729 --> 01:33:24,729
Oh, are we starting at zero again

1103
01:33:24,729 --> 01:33:26,729
with physical therapy? Whoops.

1104
01:33:26,729 --> 01:33:32,939
I'm just concerned about it.

1105
01:33:32,939 --> 01:33:38,760
There you go.

1106
01:33:38,760 --> 01:33:41,699
Oylixes

1107
01:33:41,699 --> 01:33:43,699
or oylixes, thanks for the

1108
01:33:43,699 --> 01:33:47,859
thousand bits. Ten dollars.

1109
01:33:47,859 --> 01:33:50,229
Appreciate it. Hey, Jeremy,

1110
01:33:50,229 --> 01:33:52,229
I just wanted to say that after seeing

1111
01:33:52,229 --> 01:33:54,229
taxi after taxi drive into a building and

1112
01:33:54,229 --> 01:33:56,229
explode on contact, that was some of the

1113
01:33:56,229 --> 01:33:58,229
funny you should have seen in a long time.

1114
01:33:58,229 --> 01:34:00,229
And my diaphragm and cheeks still hurt from laughing.

1115
01:34:00,229 --> 01:34:02,229
I really needed to pick me up like that.

1116
01:34:02,229 --> 01:34:04,229
You're a perfect antidepressant.

1117
01:34:04,229 --> 01:34:06,229
Thank you for all you do, and I wish you the absolute

1118
01:34:06,229 --> 01:34:08,229
best on your road to recovery.

1119
01:34:08,229 --> 01:34:10,229
I can speak for everyone present when I say that we're all here to support

1120
01:34:10,229 --> 01:34:12,229
you as you've supported us.

1121
01:34:12,229 --> 01:34:14,229
There were a couple things

1122
01:34:14,229 --> 01:34:16,229
today that really got me going.

1123
01:34:16,229 --> 01:34:18,729
And yesterday too.

1124
01:34:18,729 --> 01:34:23,850
Now that

1125
01:34:23,850 --> 01:34:25,850
it wasn't even, it was the cars was funny.

1126
01:34:25,850 --> 01:34:27,850
The first like I hit the guy in the face

1127
01:34:27,850 --> 01:34:29,850
with polos, like I just didn't think he would even do that in

1128
01:34:29,850 --> 01:34:32,279
these games. They,

1129
01:34:32,279 --> 01:34:34,279
I don't think I want like the Marvel super heroes

1130
01:34:34,279 --> 01:34:36,279
to be the good guys.

1131
01:34:36,279 --> 01:34:38,279
That's what I'm saying in Spider-Man. You just walk up

1132
01:34:38,279 --> 01:34:40,279
and wave to people. You can't like blast

1133
01:34:40,279 --> 01:34:42,279
people in the face as hard as you can.

1134
01:34:42,279 --> 01:34:47,850
It's the Hulk. Yeah, I know.

1135
01:34:47,850 --> 01:34:49,850
But the Hulk doesn't like fucking hit people

1136
01:34:49,850 --> 01:34:55,739
with wrenches and shit.

1137
01:34:55,739 --> 01:34:57,739
Hulk does bad stuff.

1138
01:34:57,739 --> 01:35:01,899
I guess, but

1139
01:35:01,899 --> 01:35:03,899
I really appreciate that. And thanks for the $10.

1140
01:35:03,899 --> 01:35:07,609
The man with the baby hands thanks for

1141
01:35:07,609 --> 01:35:09,609
500 bits. Remember when Jerma One Guy

1142
01:35:09,609 --> 01:35:11,609
was the tier 3 emote?

1143
01:35:11,609 --> 01:35:14,619
Yep. But then we

1144
01:35:14,619 --> 01:35:16,619
found a really really good use for it.

1145
01:35:16,619 --> 01:35:18,619
So it had to become baseline.

1146
01:35:18,619 --> 01:35:21,880
I can't hide that behind

1147
01:35:21,880 --> 01:35:23,880
a $25 a month, are you serious?

1148
01:35:23,880 --> 01:35:26,569
That's one of the most important

1149
01:35:26,569 --> 01:35:29,189
ways for chat to communicate

1150
01:35:29,189 --> 01:35:32,649
with me. It's really

1151
01:35:32,649 --> 01:35:34,649
easy for you guys to spam that and I know

1152
01:35:34,649 --> 01:35:36,649
that I got one guide.

1153
01:35:36,649 --> 01:35:40,619
That's incredible communication

1154
01:35:40,619 --> 01:35:47,529
tool. But yeah, I do

1155
01:35:47,529 --> 01:35:53,670
remember that. Uh, Hallulu.

1156
01:35:53,670 --> 01:35:55,670
Hallulu. Thanks for the

1157
01:35:55,670 --> 01:35:58,359
350. Hi Jerma, the last time

1158
01:35:58,359 --> 01:36:00,359
I gave you bits I asked you for streaming advice and I

1159
01:36:00,359 --> 01:36:02,359
watched the VOD the next day

1160
01:36:02,359 --> 01:36:04,359
and watched stunned to find that this led

1161
01:36:04,359 --> 01:36:06,359
to you eating baby food on camera.

1162
01:36:06,359 --> 01:36:08,920
It was a little extra weird

1163
01:36:08,920 --> 01:36:10,920
because earlier that week I was in the market

1164
01:36:10,920 --> 01:36:12,920
and was eyeing the flavors they had

1165
01:36:12,920 --> 01:36:14,920
and wished they made adult versions

1166
01:36:14,920 --> 01:36:16,920
of some of them. You get it.

1167
01:36:16,920 --> 01:36:18,920
Sweet potato, carrot, and mango

1168
01:36:18,920 --> 01:36:20,920
why wouldn't I eat that?

1169
01:36:20,920 --> 01:36:22,920
Anyway, thanks and much love to you and chat.

1170
01:36:22,920 --> 01:36:27,529
It's a tip. It's a

1171
01:36:27,529 --> 01:36:32,699
real tip.

1172
01:36:32,699 --> 01:36:37,300
The whole gang is here.

1173
01:36:37,300 --> 01:36:43,829
It's real. I do that.

1174
01:36:43,829 --> 01:36:45,829
Alright, let's get the credits to roll. We have

1175
01:36:45,829 --> 01:36:48,970
only a few more bits to do. Let's actually

1176
01:36:48,970 --> 01:36:50,970
change the scenery here.

1177
01:36:50,970 --> 01:36:53,399
Watch your head.

1178
01:36:53,399 --> 01:37:02,470
Here we go. Oh wait, am I

1179
01:37:02,470 --> 01:37:04,779
am I not

1180
01:37:04,779 --> 01:37:06,779
logged in?

1181
01:37:06,779 --> 01:37:08,779
I'm not logged in.

1182
01:37:08,779 --> 01:37:11,340
I got de-logged out.

1183
01:37:11,340 --> 01:37:14,600
Gotta log back in.

1184
01:37:14,600 --> 01:37:20,170
Hold on.

1185
01:37:20,170 --> 01:37:24,970
Nobody subbed. Imagine.

1186
01:37:24,970 --> 01:37:26,970
Why do I feel like one of these days you guys are gonna coordinate

1187
01:37:26,970 --> 01:37:28,970
to make it so nobody does so that it just scrolls by

1188
01:37:28,970 --> 01:37:30,970
and just like thanks for subbing

1189
01:37:30,970 --> 01:37:32,970
and there's just no names. There's one or two.

1190
01:37:32,970 --> 01:37:41,210
There they come. All of you, thank you

1191
01:37:41,210 --> 01:37:45,750
again. I will see you tomorrow.

1192
01:37:45,750 --> 01:37:48,060
For...I don't know.

1193
01:37:48,060 --> 01:37:50,229
There are a few

1194
01:37:50,229 --> 01:37:52,409
very good options now.

1195
01:37:52,409 --> 01:37:59,260
We'll see which one we do. Thanks for all the subs.

1196
01:37:59,260 --> 01:38:06,600
You guys fucking rock.

1197
01:38:06,600 --> 01:38:08,600
We have a few more bits. We have Keith King Crimson

1198
01:38:08,600 --> 01:38:11,420
for 250. By the way,

1199
01:38:11,420 --> 01:38:13,420
to simp someone is like to

1200
01:38:13,420 --> 01:38:15,420
white knight them or like do

1201
01:38:15,420 --> 01:38:17,420
anything for them. It's a meme.

1202
01:38:17,420 --> 01:38:21,260
No, that was Peaceful Hayley.

1203
01:38:21,260 --> 01:38:24,329
It skipped up on me.

1204
01:38:24,329 --> 01:38:26,500
Peaceful, that was Peaceful Hayley. Did I say Peaceful

1205
01:38:26,500 --> 01:38:28,500
Hayley? Am I losing my mind?

1206
01:38:28,500 --> 01:38:31,380
It's just a meme. It's just a

1207
01:38:31,380 --> 01:38:36,380
meme. Hey, you said

1208
01:38:36,380 --> 01:38:38,380
it. You said it.

1209
01:38:38,380 --> 01:38:43,029
Thanks for the 250.

1210
01:38:43,029 --> 01:38:45,029
Thanks for the 250. I saw someone bring this up

1211
01:38:45,029 --> 01:38:47,029
and all the memories came back.

1212
01:38:47,029 --> 01:38:49,029
Remember clown in the town.

1213
01:38:49,029 --> 01:38:51,029
Now that you're a millionaire, this

1214
01:38:51,029 --> 01:38:53,029
project becomes much more reasonable, doesn't

1215
01:38:53,029 --> 01:38:55,029
it? Now gather star and MLC

1216
01:38:55,029 --> 01:38:57,029
Stealth and make it reality. Looking forward

1217
01:38:57,029 --> 01:39:02,220
to it. That's

1218
01:39:02,220 --> 01:39:04,220
one of the best ideas.

1219
01:39:04,220 --> 01:39:08,380
And we have that

1220
01:39:08,380 --> 01:39:10,380
conversation stamped.

1221
01:39:10,380 --> 01:39:12,380
It's like ours, you know what I mean?

1222
01:39:12,380 --> 01:39:14,380
If somebody does clown in the town, it's like, no, no, excuse

1223
01:39:14,380 --> 01:39:16,380
me. You took that from us.

1224
01:39:16,380 --> 01:39:21,560
That whole explanation of how

1225
01:39:21,560 --> 01:39:23,560
that would work is just, that would be

1226
01:39:23,560 --> 01:39:26,819
an amazing TV show. It'd be

1227
01:39:26,819 --> 01:39:32,840
fucking incredible. Keith King Crimson

1228
01:39:32,840 --> 01:39:34,840
thanks for the 250. Look, Jerma, I may

1229
01:39:34,840 --> 01:39:36,840
not be good at catching feathers or oysters

1230
01:39:36,840 --> 01:39:38,840
or tracing zodiac signs, but at least

1231
01:39:38,840 --> 01:39:41,140
I have to get

1232
01:39:41,140 --> 01:39:45,239
back to you on that one. What's clown

1233
01:39:45,239 --> 01:39:47,239
in the town? Clown in the town is one of those

1234
01:39:47,239 --> 01:39:49,239
things that it would take 45

1235
01:39:49,239 --> 01:39:51,239
minutes for me to explain it to you.

1236
01:39:51,239 --> 01:39:53,539
I think there are a couple of YouTube videos

1237
01:39:53,539 --> 01:39:55,539
that have the full thing

1238
01:39:55,539 --> 01:40:00,979
and it is the full explanation

1239
01:40:00,979 --> 01:40:04,310
of clown in the town. I have

1240
01:40:04,310 --> 01:40:06,310
it on my Soundcloud. Let me. Really?

1241
01:40:06,310 --> 01:40:12,579
Thank you, Keith King Crimson.

1242
01:40:12,579 --> 01:40:14,890
Anson is a copter.

1243
01:40:14,890 --> 01:40:16,890
I don't know.

1244
01:40:16,890 --> 01:40:18,890
I like doing things,

1245
01:40:18,890 --> 01:40:20,890
but I don't know if that thing is possible.

1246
01:40:20,890 --> 01:40:24,090
I don't know.

1247
01:40:24,090 --> 01:40:26,090
Hey, Tar Alecran, thanks for the 250. Just use the random Jerma

1248
01:40:26,090 --> 01:40:28,090
moment feature from that website and got one of those

1249
01:40:28,090 --> 01:40:30,090
10 minute stretches where you didn't talk

1250
01:40:30,090 --> 01:40:32,090
from rhythm heaven.

1251
01:40:32,090 --> 01:40:34,090
Alright, don't tell me

1252
01:40:34,090 --> 01:40:36,090
these things. Don't tell me these things.

1253
01:40:36,090 --> 01:40:38,090
This is like 3500 hours

1254
01:40:38,090 --> 01:40:42,760
of videos and streams. I wonder

1255
01:40:42,760 --> 01:40:44,760
what the algorithm, where it can pull

1256
01:40:44,760 --> 01:40:46,760
from? Is it possible to get pull from all of it?

1257
01:40:46,760 --> 01:40:52,329
I can't wait.

1258
01:40:52,329 --> 01:40:55,210
This is going to be so much fun.

1259
01:40:55,210 --> 01:40:57,210
I got one. It was a sim getting hit by a car.

1260
01:41:00,220 --> 01:41:02,220
Oh man, that's going to be so

1261
01:41:02,220 --> 01:41:06,569
funny. How does it determine

1262
01:41:06,569 --> 01:41:08,569
a moment? It just picks a random

1263
01:41:08,569 --> 01:41:10,569
timestamp on a random

1264
01:41:10,569 --> 01:41:12,569
stream.

1265
01:41:12,569 --> 01:41:20,359
And there are

1266
01:41:20,359 --> 01:41:22,359
uploaded and documented

1267
01:41:22,359 --> 01:41:24,359
about 3500 hours, which is probably

1268
01:41:24,359 --> 01:41:26,539
it's probably 70

1269
01:41:26,539 --> 01:41:28,539
to 80% of every stream I've ever done.

1270
01:41:28,539 --> 01:41:30,539
I think this is probably like streams

1271
01:41:30,539 --> 01:41:32,539
that have been lost that have not been uploaded

1272
01:41:32,539 --> 01:41:34,539
or that have got deleted somehow

1273
01:41:34,539 --> 01:41:36,539
over the last four or five years.

1274
01:41:36,539 --> 01:41:40,180
But I look forward to this.

1275
01:41:40,180 --> 01:41:44,729
This is going to be fun. There are

1276
01:41:44,729 --> 01:41:46,729
133 days.

1277
01:41:46,729 --> 01:41:49,220
That's a lot of content

1278
01:41:49,220 --> 01:41:51,220
to randomly generate.

1279
01:41:51,220 --> 01:42:01,319
I'm excited for this.

1280
01:42:01,319 --> 01:42:03,319
We're going to go channel surfing

1281
01:42:03,319 --> 01:42:06,520
from every stream I've ever done.

1282
01:42:06,520 --> 01:42:10,470
It'll be fun.

1283
01:42:10,470 --> 01:42:12,470
Garfield the Monday Killer, thanks for the 250.

1284
01:42:12,470 --> 01:42:15,859
It's a time for new beginnings.

1285
01:42:15,859 --> 01:42:17,859
Garfield's full animated Sonic film

1286
01:42:17,859 --> 01:42:19,859
just premiered.

1287
01:42:19,859 --> 01:42:21,859
I'm sure there were a few delays, but it's out.

1288
01:42:21,859 --> 01:42:23,859
This is some drawn out joke about how I directed

1289
01:42:23,859 --> 01:42:25,859
the Sonic movie.

1290
01:42:25,859 --> 01:42:27,859
There's currently an hour long reanimated

1291
01:42:27,859 --> 01:42:29,859
Sonic film called Sonic Rebuilt for free

1292
01:42:29,859 --> 01:42:31,859
on YouTube. I know I can't

1293
01:42:31,859 --> 01:42:33,859
send links anymore, but it'd mean the world to me

1294
01:42:33,859 --> 01:42:37,130
if you checked some of it out.

1295
01:42:37,130 --> 01:42:39,130
Big shout out to all the animators who helped

1296
01:42:39,130 --> 01:42:42,140
directed it for you in chat.

1297
01:42:42,140 --> 01:42:49,369
This thing's an hour long? Link banned.

1298
01:42:49,369 --> 01:42:51,369
Hey, sorry, I'm fucking

1299
01:42:51,369 --> 01:42:53,369
Link banned.

1300
01:42:53,369 --> 01:43:00,920
That's cool that you

1301
01:43:00,920 --> 01:43:02,920
that's done. I didn't know it was going to be

1302
01:43:02,920 --> 01:43:04,920
that long. I thought this was like a

1303
01:43:04,920 --> 01:43:06,920
10 minute project.

1304
01:43:06,920 --> 01:43:08,920
Like a full hour long feature.

1305
01:43:08,920 --> 01:43:20,310
Holy shit. When's the rat movie

1306
01:43:20,310 --> 01:43:22,310
reanimated thing coming out?

1307
01:43:22,310 --> 01:43:26,149
Oh, I've heard about that.

1308
01:43:26,149 --> 01:43:28,460
Can we get a link? Yeah, check it out.

1309
01:43:28,460 --> 01:43:30,460
I can't really watch that right now.

1310
01:43:30,460 --> 01:43:32,699
But I will definitely

1311
01:43:32,699 --> 01:43:35,000
click it and I will watch it.

1312
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:37,000
I don't think I

1313
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:39,000
don't even watch TV shows for an hour.

1314
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:47,640
I'll be honest with you. You know how long it's

1315
01:43:47,640 --> 01:43:49,640
taken for people to try to get me to watch Joel's

1316
01:43:49,640 --> 01:43:51,640
3D movie, Baker movie, that's like 26

1317
01:43:51,640 --> 01:43:54,069
minutes long?

1318
01:43:54,069 --> 01:43:56,069
Ah, fuck, I don't have

1319
01:43:56,069 --> 01:43:58,380
I'll watch it, I will.

1320
01:43:58,380 --> 01:44:05,779
But yeah, he still wants

1321
01:44:05,779 --> 01:44:07,779
you to watch it. I know, I know, I know,

1322
01:44:07,779 --> 01:44:09,779
I know. I have watched it. I've got a lot of

1323
01:44:09,779 --> 01:44:15,479
things to watch. Just watch it two minutes

1324
01:44:15,479 --> 01:44:18,170
at a time. No,

1325
01:44:18,170 --> 01:44:20,170
you can't just watch it one minute at a time.

1326
01:44:20,170 --> 01:44:23,880
Watch Joel's movie. Do it

1327
01:44:23,880 --> 01:44:25,880
on community content night. But it's not community

1328
01:44:25,880 --> 01:44:27,880
content night because Joel didn't make that

1329
01:44:27,880 --> 01:44:29,880
for community content night.

1330
01:44:29,880 --> 01:44:37,050
That's why you have to watch it two minutes.

1331
01:44:37,050 --> 01:44:39,420
Rip the Band-Aid off. He watches

1332
01:44:39,420 --> 01:44:41,420
your movies and you won't watch his?

1333
01:44:41,420 --> 01:44:45,369
Who cares? Watch it anyway. Yeah,

1334
01:44:45,369 --> 01:44:47,609
he did. It's not how it worked.

1335
01:44:47,609 --> 01:44:49,609
It's still content from the

1336
01:44:49,609 --> 01:44:53,000
community. Alright, well

1337
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:55,000
we're gonna watch Joel's movie

1338
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:57,000
not on Sunday. Not on Sunday.

1339
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:59,000
We're gonna watch

1340
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:01,000
Joel's 3D movie maker movie.

1341
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:09,510
I'm gonna give you a date.

1342
01:45:09,510 --> 01:45:13,289
Thursday the

1343
01:45:13,289 --> 01:45:19,500
Hold on. Thursday the 12th.

1344
01:45:19,500 --> 01:45:21,670
On the shoe eating stream.

1345
01:45:21,670 --> 01:45:25,260
I'm gonna watch

1346
01:45:25,260 --> 01:45:27,260
Joel's movie maker movie

1347
01:45:27,260 --> 01:45:33,020
while I eat a shoe.

1348
01:45:33,020 --> 01:45:38,260
In fact, that's gonna be the first

1349
01:45:38,260 --> 01:45:40,500
stream after

1350
01:45:40,500 --> 01:45:42,939
coming back from

1351
01:45:42,939 --> 01:45:44,939
being off for a few days.

1352
01:45:44,939 --> 01:45:46,939
We're streaming tomorrow,

1353
01:45:46,939 --> 01:45:48,939
we're doing Sunday community content night, and

1354
01:45:48,939 --> 01:45:50,939
then I'm gonna be off for a few days.

1355
01:45:50,939 --> 01:45:52,939
When I come back on Thursday the 12th,

1356
01:45:52,939 --> 01:45:54,939
I'm gonna eat a fucking shoe.

1357
01:45:54,939 --> 01:45:57,369
And we're gonna watch that movie.

1358
01:45:57,369 --> 01:46:01,529
It's too much candy?

1359
01:46:01,529 --> 01:46:08,489
Don't worry. He needs a few days

1360
01:46:08,489 --> 01:46:10,489
to make an edible shoe.

1361
01:46:10,489 --> 01:46:23,420
I didn't say what kind

1362
01:46:23,420 --> 01:46:25,420
of shoe it had to be. It's just

1363
01:46:25,420 --> 01:46:27,420
a shoe or a

1364
01:46:27,420 --> 01:46:29,420
shoe-like substance.

1365
01:46:33,770 --> 01:46:36,579
What was that laugh?

1366
01:46:36,579 --> 01:46:38,579
I hated that.

1367
01:46:38,579 --> 01:46:41,340
That was a horrible laugh.

1368
01:46:41,340 --> 01:46:49,340
But we had 250 from

1369
01:46:49,340 --> 01:46:52,789
Goo Berry Juice.

1370
01:46:52,789 --> 01:46:54,789
If you want to find out if you're a bull or a koala,

1371
01:46:54,789 --> 01:46:56,789
try this quiz. It's not bad, I promise.

1372
01:46:56,789 --> 01:46:59,029
I think it'd be interesting to do it on stream.

1373
01:46:59,029 --> 01:47:01,029
Also, can I know which animal

1374
01:47:01,029 --> 01:47:03,029
to photoshop your face onto?

1375
01:47:03,029 --> 01:47:05,829
A lion.

1376
01:47:05,829 --> 01:47:07,829
Animalinu.com

1377
01:47:07,829 --> 01:47:09,829
Somebody remember that? Because we're doing that

1378
01:47:09,829 --> 01:47:12,840
on Thursday the 12th.

1379
01:47:12,840 --> 01:47:15,979
Thursday the 12th is gonna be

1380
01:47:15,979 --> 01:47:17,979
an absolute dog shit stream.

1381
01:47:17,979 --> 01:47:24,380
Thursday the 12th is gonna be the worst stream

1382
01:47:24,380 --> 01:47:26,380
of the year.

1383
01:47:26,380 --> 01:47:35,720
It's the fulfilled promise stream.

1384
01:47:35,720 --> 01:47:45,579
Okay, so look.

1385
01:47:45,579 --> 01:47:47,579
Let's be real.

1386
01:47:47,579 --> 01:47:49,579
I'm gonna watch a 3D movie maker movie

1387
01:47:49,579 --> 01:47:51,579
that's 30 minutes long, eat a

1388
01:47:51,579 --> 01:47:53,579
shoe on camera, and

1389
01:47:53,579 --> 01:47:57,220
do an animal quiz.

1390
01:47:57,220 --> 01:47:59,220
That's what's planned for the 12th.

1391
01:47:59,220 --> 01:48:07,210
So, sounds fun.

1392
01:48:07,210 --> 01:48:13,220
It sounds bad when you say it

1393
01:48:13,220 --> 01:48:15,529
like that. You mean saying it

1394
01:48:15,529 --> 01:48:21,989
out loud?

1395
01:48:21,989 --> 01:48:23,989
Wow, well thanks for the 400 bits.

1396
01:48:23,989 --> 01:48:27,130
Jerma Grinch.

1397
01:48:27,130 --> 01:48:30,010
With some snowmen emotes.

1398
01:48:30,010 --> 01:48:32,010
Don't eat a shoe. If you think I'm

1399
01:48:32,010 --> 01:48:34,010
gonna eat, like, a

1400
01:48:34,010 --> 01:48:36,500
Skechers shoe.

1401
01:48:36,500 --> 01:48:38,500
I don't know what to tell you.

1402
01:48:38,500 --> 01:48:43,050
I'm gonna eat a

1403
01:48:43,050 --> 01:48:47,770
shoe.

1404
01:48:47,770 --> 01:48:50,390
Shooo

1405
01:48:50,390 --> 01:49:03,880
on camera. Yes.

1406
01:49:03,880 --> 01:49:05,880
Awfutz.

1407
01:49:05,880 --> 01:49:08,630
Thanks for the 500 bits, Awfutz.

1408
01:49:08,630 --> 01:49:10,630
Five dollars, thanks a lot. Haven't been able to watch

1409
01:49:10,630 --> 01:49:12,630
the streams lately because of school, and I feel

1410
01:49:12,630 --> 01:49:14,630
incredibly behind, and I'm like missing out on all the

1411
01:49:14,630 --> 01:49:16,630
fun. The other day I started calling

1412
01:49:16,630 --> 01:49:18,630
you King, and you noticed that

1413
01:49:18,630 --> 01:49:20,630
three streams in a row, and kind of

1414
01:49:20,630 --> 01:49:22,630
seemed Monka-esque out.

1415
01:49:22,630 --> 01:49:24,630
It's just a reminder that you're

1416
01:49:24,630 --> 01:49:26,869
King. Thanks for the lulz.

1417
01:49:26,869 --> 01:49:32,250
Wait, so when I've been saying

1418
01:49:32,250 --> 01:49:34,250
You know, I've been seeing somebody

1419
01:49:34,250 --> 01:49:36,250
I've been seeing a lot of King. What's a King?

1420
01:49:36,250 --> 01:49:38,250
It was the same person.

1421
01:49:38,250 --> 01:49:44,119
And I just caught it three

1422
01:49:44,119 --> 01:49:46,119
times in a row. It's literally

1423
01:49:46,119 --> 01:49:50,729
just me.

1424
01:49:50,729 --> 01:49:54,359
Wow.

1425
01:49:54,359 --> 01:49:56,359
I thought it was if people write in it.

1426
01:49:56,359 --> 01:49:58,859
It's only been one person.

1427
01:49:58,859 --> 01:50:00,859
No one else has been doing it.

1428
01:50:00,859 --> 01:50:05,210
It's literally just

1429
01:50:05,210 --> 01:50:09,050
me. I thought it was a shit load

1430
01:50:09,050 --> 01:50:11,420
of people.

1431
01:50:11,420 --> 01:50:15,000
That's fucking funny.

1432
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:17,000
Thanks for the five dollars, dude.

1433
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:20,069
Opster Narwhal, again, thanks

1434
01:50:20,069 --> 01:50:22,069
for 253. Have you heard of the PlayStation

1435
01:50:22,069 --> 01:50:24,069
2 classic Muppets Party Cruise?

1436
01:50:24,069 --> 01:50:26,760
It's a true hidden gem, and must

1437
01:50:26,760 --> 01:50:28,760
be played on stream. So do it.

1438
01:50:28,760 --> 01:50:30,760
That or RollerCoaster Tycoon 3.

1439
01:50:30,760 --> 01:50:32,760
Also, people be paying

1440
01:50:32,760 --> 01:50:34,760
75,000 channel points for

1441
01:50:34,760 --> 01:50:36,760
Winx when I have an infinite amount

1442
01:50:36,760 --> 01:50:38,939
of German Wink, German Wink,

1443
01:50:38,939 --> 01:50:44,699
German Wink, German Wink. What does that mean?

1444
01:50:44,699 --> 01:50:51,029
Muppets Party Cruise.

1445
01:50:51,029 --> 01:51:00,060
Garfield the Monday Killer,

1446
01:51:00,060 --> 01:51:02,060
thanks for the 250. You don't have to watch the whole

1447
01:51:02,060 --> 01:51:04,060
thing on stream. Just skip around.

1448
01:51:04,060 --> 01:51:06,359
I just wanted some raw German commentary.

1449
01:51:06,359 --> 01:51:08,789
I don't know.

1450
01:51:08,789 --> 01:51:12,380
We'll do it on Sunday.

1451
01:51:12,380 --> 01:51:14,869
That's like a community piece of content

1452
01:51:14,869 --> 01:51:16,869
that qualifies.

1453
01:51:16,869 --> 01:51:18,869
I'll skip through and watch a couple of

1454
01:51:18,869 --> 01:51:26,869
pieces of it on Sunday.

1455
01:51:26,869 --> 01:51:28,869
What are you going to do? Don't starve together.

1456
01:51:28,869 --> 01:51:33,020
I don't think I am.

1457
01:51:33,020 --> 01:51:42,039
Winx are going to be half off on Sunday?

1458
01:51:42,039 --> 01:51:45,050
They might even be lower than that.

1459
01:51:45,050 --> 01:51:47,050
FutureGamer, thanks for 250. How is FTK

1460
01:51:47,050 --> 01:51:49,050
coming along? Any time frame yet?

1461
01:51:49,050 --> 01:51:51,930
Um, not

1462
01:51:51,930 --> 01:51:55,380
before German

1463
01:51:55,380 --> 01:51:58,010
Rumble charity.

1464
01:51:58,010 --> 01:52:00,010
There's going to be a charity German Rumble stream

1465
01:52:00,010 --> 01:52:02,010
that happens over the next few weeks.

1466
01:52:02,010 --> 01:52:10,649
A buddy of mine is running

1467
01:52:10,649 --> 01:52:13,270
in the Boston Marathon

1468
01:52:13,270 --> 01:52:15,270
and we are going to do a charity stream

1469
01:52:15,270 --> 01:52:18,020
to sponsor

1470
01:52:18,020 --> 01:52:20,579
his run.

1471
01:52:20,579 --> 01:52:22,579
And all the money that,

1472
01:52:22,579 --> 01:52:24,579
every cent that

1473
01:52:24,579 --> 01:52:26,579
comes into that stream

1474
01:52:26,579 --> 01:52:28,890
is going to be a couple of places to make it easy.

1475
01:52:28,890 --> 01:52:30,890
We'll go directly to

1476
01:52:30,890 --> 01:52:32,890
the foundation

1477
01:52:32,890 --> 01:52:35,060
that is going to sponsor

1478
01:52:35,060 --> 01:52:41,909
his run.

1479
01:52:41,909 --> 01:52:43,909
A lot of people were talking about charity

1480
01:52:43,909 --> 01:52:45,909
stuff and charity streams

1481
01:52:45,909 --> 01:52:47,909
and I've never really done one

1482
01:52:47,909 --> 01:52:49,909
on my own, on my own

1483
01:52:49,909 --> 01:52:52,220
channel.

1484
01:52:52,220 --> 01:52:54,220
I've been a part of a lot of other

1485
01:52:54,220 --> 01:52:56,220
great projects

1486
01:52:56,220 --> 01:52:58,220
and great charity events, right?

1487
01:52:58,220 --> 01:53:00,220
The Blind Saw stuff

1488
01:53:00,220 --> 01:53:02,220
the last couple of years has been

1489
01:53:02,220 --> 01:53:04,220
somewhat involved with some of it.

1490
01:53:04,220 --> 01:53:06,779
Obviously the Tip of the Hat stuff

1491
01:53:06,779 --> 01:53:08,779
in years past.

1492
01:53:08,779 --> 01:53:10,779
I've never done one, I've never

1493
01:53:10,779 --> 01:53:12,779
done one. I'm always on somebody

1494
01:53:12,779 --> 01:53:14,779
else's thing and I think it just,

1495
01:53:14,779 --> 01:53:16,779
it's time to try to do one. I just want to

1496
01:53:16,779 --> 01:53:18,779
try it and see if we can do some.

1497
01:53:18,779 --> 01:53:28,760
So there will be,

1498
01:53:28,760 --> 01:53:30,939
there will be a lot more information on that

1499
01:53:30,939 --> 01:53:33,880
a week or two before it

1500
01:53:33,880 --> 01:53:35,880
happens because I'm not just going to like do

1501
01:53:35,880 --> 01:53:37,880
a, hey here it, German Rumble,

1502
01:53:37,880 --> 01:53:39,880
here it is. At least two

1503
01:53:39,880 --> 01:53:41,880
or three weeks before that stream happens, which it has

1504
01:53:41,880 --> 01:53:43,880
to happen before

1505
01:53:43,880 --> 01:53:46,500
the, when's the Boston Marathon?

1506
01:53:46,500 --> 01:53:48,500
April like 10th? April 20th or something?

1507
01:53:48,500 --> 01:53:54,140
April 20th.

1508
01:53:54,140 --> 01:53:56,500
So before April 20th

1509
01:53:56,500 --> 01:53:59,380
it will be a stream.

1510
01:53:59,380 --> 01:54:01,689
And it's going to be the German Rumble.

1511
01:54:01,689 --> 01:54:03,859
I know it's a little late

1512
01:54:03,859 --> 01:54:05,859
but it'll be there.

1513
01:54:05,859 --> 01:54:12,310
It should be good.

1514
01:54:12,310 --> 01:54:14,310
But that is the end.

1515
01:54:14,310 --> 01:54:16,310
I will see you guys later.

1516
01:54:16,310 --> 01:54:19,380
I'll see you tomorrow.

1517
01:54:19,380 --> 01:54:21,380
We got some options and I'll be in

1518
01:54:21,380 --> 01:54:23,380
pre-stream chat before the stream turns on.

1519
01:54:23,380 --> 01:54:25,380
So we can kind of discuss it,

1520
01:54:25,380 --> 01:54:28,390
talk about it. I am going to go, I am

1521
01:54:28,390 --> 01:54:30,390
very hungry. So I'm going to get out of here.

1522
01:54:30,390 --> 01:54:33,210
Have a good night, take care,

1523
01:54:33,210 --> 01:54:36,140
and goodbye. See you soon.

1524
01:54:36,140 --> 01:55:06,920
Right at the buzzer we had 250

1525
01:55:06,920 --> 01:55:08,920
from GooBerryJuice. Hey

1526
01:55:08,920 --> 01:55:10,920
King985, remember that game I talked about a few

1527
01:55:10,920 --> 01:55:12,920
streams ago? AlphaChimp, who is only

1528
01:55:12,920 --> 01:55:14,920
available on Xbox Live. Turns out it's free

1529
01:55:14,920 --> 01:55:16,920
on PC now. Please play it, it's so good.

1530
01:55:16,920 --> 01:55:23,060
Please God.

1531
01:55:23,060 --> 01:55:25,880
Thanks. Uh, maybe.

1532
01:55:25,880 --> 01:55:27,880
Not tomorrow and not the next day.

1533
01:55:27,880 --> 01:55:32,170
I'm

1534
01:55:32,170 --> 01:55:34,170
begging.

1535
01:55:34,170 --> 01:55:36,170
Please God in all

1536
01:55:36,170 --> 01:55:38,859
capitals. That means

1537
01:55:38,859 --> 01:55:40,859
never. No it doesn't. It means not immediately,

1538
01:55:40,859 --> 01:55:43,420
which means never.

1539
01:55:43,420 --> 01:55:45,420
But never on this channel doesn't actually mean never.

1540
01:55:45,420 --> 01:55:47,420
It means maybe a

1541
01:55:47,420 --> 01:55:49,590
year. You might just see it,

1542
01:55:49,590 --> 01:55:51,590
I don't think I was going to ever play Super Mario

1543
01:55:51,590 --> 01:55:53,590
Sunshine on this stream. I think like

1544
01:55:53,590 --> 01:55:56,789
two years ago, people

1545
01:55:56,789 --> 01:55:58,789
were like, hey dude, you should,

1546
01:55:58,789 --> 01:56:00,789
you're thinking about doing GameCube streams.

1547
01:56:00,789 --> 01:56:02,789
You're doing like PlayStation 1, PlayStation 2 stuff.

1548
01:56:02,789 --> 01:56:04,789
You would love the GameCube stuff.

1549
01:56:04,789 --> 01:56:06,789
And I'm like, yeah, I don't know, maybe like in a few months.

1550
01:56:06,789 --> 01:56:08,789
You should play Mario Sunshine.

1551
01:56:08,789 --> 01:56:10,789
Yeah, I don't know. Probably not.

1552
01:56:10,789 --> 01:56:12,789
Here we are. It's been two years.

1553
01:56:12,789 --> 01:56:19,319
Never doesn't mean never on

1554
01:56:19,319 --> 01:56:21,500
this channel. It means like

1555
01:56:21,500 --> 01:56:23,500
probably not. For a long time.

1556
01:56:23,500 --> 01:56:31,479
But I did

1557
01:56:31,479 --> 01:56:33,479
not say that I was never going to play

1558
01:56:33,479 --> 01:56:35,479
AlphaChimp.

1559
01:56:35,479 --> 01:56:45,619
So don't worry. Don't worry.

1560
01:56:45,619 --> 01:56:47,619
Uh, then finally I have Obstinawal

1561
01:56:47,619 --> 01:56:49,619
for five dollars. So I'm going to ask this and I thought it

1562
01:56:49,619 --> 01:56:51,619
should be answered. Will the rumble be pushed

1563
01:56:51,619 --> 01:56:53,619
back if the marathon gets canceled due

1564
01:56:53,619 --> 01:56:55,619
to Corona? Or will we just

1565
01:56:55,619 --> 01:56:57,619
do it to get it out of the way?

1566
01:56:57,619 --> 01:56:59,619
Um, I, that's a

1567
01:56:59,619 --> 01:57:01,619
really, really, really good question.

1568
01:57:01,619 --> 01:57:03,619
Because I don't really have an answer for that.

1569
01:57:03,619 --> 01:57:08,680
Because I, I don't know

1570
01:57:08,680 --> 01:57:10,680
what, if that would happen or if it's

1571
01:57:10,680 --> 01:57:13,689
possible or what would

1572
01:57:13,689 --> 01:57:16,180
probably end up happening

1573
01:57:16,180 --> 01:57:19,000
is, hmm.

1574
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:21,239
If something like that

1575
01:57:21,239 --> 01:57:23,420
does happen, which

1576
01:57:23,420 --> 01:57:25,420
God forbid, hopefully not, right?

1577
01:57:25,420 --> 01:57:27,420
I mean, hopefully this can be contained

1578
01:57:27,420 --> 01:57:29,420
and it's not, doesn't turn into

1579
01:57:29,420 --> 01:57:31,420
anything super serious.

1580
01:57:31,420 --> 01:57:33,420
Uh, but

1581
01:57:33,420 --> 01:57:35,420
in the event for some reason it does

1582
01:57:35,420 --> 01:57:37,420
turn into something like that.

1583
01:57:37,420 --> 01:57:40,680
Um, we'll probably

1584
01:57:40,680 --> 01:57:42,680
if it gets moved

1585
01:57:42,680 --> 01:57:45,050
we'll probably just do the same and move it.

1586
01:57:45,050 --> 01:57:49,210
And I might do a

1587
01:57:49,210 --> 01:57:51,210
sort of like a pre

1588
01:57:51,210 --> 01:57:53,210
not like a full rumble. Maybe I'll do

1589
01:57:53,210 --> 01:57:55,210
like a little like wrestling card

1590
01:57:55,210 --> 01:57:57,210
that's not the rumble but just maybe

1591
01:57:57,210 --> 01:57:59,210
introduces some of the new characters maybe.

1592
01:57:59,210 --> 01:58:01,210
Just for fun for like maybe like an hour or two.

1593
01:58:01,210 --> 01:58:06,310
We'll see.

1594
01:58:06,310 --> 01:58:08,310
There's no way that that's gonna happen.

1595
01:58:08,310 --> 01:58:10,310
I mean, what the probability

1596
01:58:10,310 --> 01:58:12,310
maybe, but I mean there's always a

1597
01:58:12,310 --> 01:58:14,310
chance that something bad could happen, right? There's always

1598
01:58:14,310 --> 01:58:16,310
a chance that something like this

1599
01:58:16,310 --> 01:58:18,489
is not contained and

1600
01:58:18,489 --> 01:58:20,489
for some reason it gets out of control

1601
01:58:20,489 --> 01:58:22,489
and it has to be lots of closings

1602
01:58:22,489 --> 01:58:24,489
and stuff. I mean it's, it's possible.

1603
01:58:24,489 --> 01:58:26,489
Is it probable? No.

1604
01:58:26,489 --> 01:58:28,489
But it's possible.

1605
01:58:28,489 --> 01:58:30,920
A lot of huge things have been cancelled recently.

1606
01:58:30,920 --> 01:58:32,920
Yeah, it's, I mean

1607
01:58:32,920 --> 01:58:36,060
some of them, yeah. Twitchcon

1608
01:58:36,060 --> 01:58:38,060
Amsterdam, ECCC.

1609
01:58:38,060 --> 01:58:43,220
Yeah.

1610
01:58:43,220 --> 01:58:45,220
I don't know. I guess that's kind of have to be

1611
01:58:45,220 --> 01:58:47,220
gonna have to be a wait and see scenario to see what actually

1612
01:58:47,220 --> 01:58:51,449
happens. It's

1613
01:58:51,449 --> 01:58:56,039
not a bad thing to think about though.

1614
01:58:56,039 --> 01:58:58,039
SXSW was cancelled, yeah.

1615
01:58:58,039 --> 01:59:00,710
That's true.

1616
01:59:00,710 --> 01:59:02,710
FutureGamer for 250, thanks a lot dude for the 250.

1617
01:59:02,710 --> 01:59:06,229
My school shut down

1618
01:59:06,229 --> 01:59:08,229
a

1619
01:59:08,229 --> 01:59:10,229
school shut down, a Rome travel study

1620
01:59:10,229 --> 01:59:12,229
and everyone was sent home and told to

1621
01:59:12,229 --> 01:59:14,229
self quarantine for 14 days. Jesus.

1622
01:59:14,229 --> 01:59:17,050
Yeah, this shit's no joke.

1623
01:59:17,050 --> 01:59:26,390
But we'll cross that bridge if we have to.

1624
01:59:26,390 --> 01:59:30,300
And I'll figure it out from there.

1625
01:59:30,300 --> 01:59:32,300
I'm gonna go. Before I

1626
01:59:32,300 --> 01:59:34,300
go, I'm going to

1627
01:59:34,300 --> 01:59:36,300
I'm gonna turn on

1628
01:59:36,300 --> 01:59:38,300
the voice

1629
01:59:38,300 --> 01:59:40,300
changer to low and echoey

1630
01:59:40,300 --> 01:59:42,300
and make a bunch of noises.

1631
01:59:42,300 --> 01:59:44,300
How you feel about that? Do you guys feel pretty good about that I think?

1632
01:59:44,300 --> 01:59:46,300
Right, that's

1633
01:59:46,300 --> 01:59:48,300
what I'm going for. And I'll see you tomorrow.

1634
01:59:48,300 --> 01:59:50,300
Have a good night.

1635
01:59:50,300 --> 01:59:59,109
Bye!
