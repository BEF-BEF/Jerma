00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:12,820
Good afternoon. Welcome to class. I'm your teacher, Sternma. I'm Stern today.

2
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:28,089
I got bubblegum, get the fuck out of here. I can smell it. Hi guys. Uh-oh, internet. Uh-oh. Uh-oh.

3
00:00:28,089 --> 00:00:40,179
Kind of going with the theme here. Starting streams and having them have cox problems.

4
00:00:40,179 --> 00:00:51,170
But, Resident Evil 2 tonight. Looking forward to it a lot. I played the original a long time ago.

5
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:58,159
And fucking, are we going to turn off? Is this stream going to stay connected to the internet?

6
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:12,739
Well, I'm not even going to tweet this out yet. This is, they're just playing with me here. It's not actually going to happen.

7
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:28,079
I've been looking forward to it. Germa Pluto. Yeah, you moved to avoid this? Well, here's the problem. I live in North America.

8
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:48,930
It's a problem everywhere, unfortunately. I think it's going to be fine.

9
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:54,930
I'm going to do a prediction here in about five minutes. It's like it's not even, it's like it never happened.

10
00:01:54,930 --> 00:02:08,740
Just take a balloon to Europe. You know, I might as well. All right, quick. What's the best state in Europe?

11
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:30,060
Somebody said Norway? Norway. I've seen a lot of Norways. London? But isn't that not even?

12
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:43,680
All right, give me a second. I'm going to go just, I'm not going anywhere. I'm actually, I'm just going to like sit here like this.

13
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:50,680
Let's turn the camera on just to as well. All right. But hold on. Let me make sure that this note like I'm not like naked in this one.

14
00:02:50,680 --> 00:03:30,319
OK, I should be clothed. I am. OK, well, hi everybody. Welcome to the spring.

15
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:37,560
This is this is the portion of the stream where we sometimes just have to wait until I'm allowed to have my internet work.

16
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:48,560
And how was your Monday? I was pretty good. My hair slicked back with oil and I went like this.

17
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:57,569
I just stuck my hands into like jelly. I just went like this and I smeared it back over my fucking head.

18
00:03:57,569 --> 00:04:02,939
I had to look OK today because the face cam might come on at random jump scare moments.

19
00:04:02,939 --> 00:04:32,740
Two thousand drop frames. Don't do it to us again. Turn off the lights. It's the middle of the daytime, though.

20
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:38,579
I can't just turn the lights off. That's that's too much. It's too much for my brain.

21
00:04:38,579 --> 00:04:46,620
I cannot sit in a dark room when it's light outside. Do it. No, I don't. It's it's daytime.

22
00:04:46,620 --> 00:05:00,180
You're going to fuck with my cerebral. It's not going to do anything. There's light coming through the window over here.

23
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:16,449
My camera just auto adjusted because this this light coming. It didn't do anything. You think this is going to be scary?

24
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:34,879
No, boomer cerebral can't handle the dark. No, the boomers cerebral can't handle the red indicator that keeps popping up on my OBS.

25
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:42,620
The next time I get Internet, I'm going to ask a very specific question.

26
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:49,540
I'm going to ask, can I reach the moon in less than a tenth of a second?

27
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:55,540
And will it come back to me from the moon in less than a tenth of a second?

28
00:05:55,540 --> 00:06:15,459
If the answer is no, I'm going to tell them to fuck off. Rude. I'll tell you what's rude.

29
00:06:15,459 --> 00:06:27,850
You know what's rude? Charging fucking hundreds of dollars a month for a service that only wants to work like fucking 48 percent of the time.

30
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:46,360
That's pretty rude. That's real rude. Actually, it might even be goddamn illegal. It's not. That's rude. It's rude.

31
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:49,360
But it'll it'll fix itself. Don't worry.

32
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:56,500
They can't turn this back on. That looks so much worse. It looks terrible. I don't like how that looks.

33
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:06,860
In fact, let me move this where because I'm going to be like looking this way. Right.

34
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:18,620
So it needs to be like over here. That's way too far.

35
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:22,860
That's not that's good because I'm going to be like looking this way. Right.

36
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:30,750
You have to use the vlogger angle. I don't know what that means.

37
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:41,420
No, this is the one time like a year you're going to get a face cam. So let's do it. All right.

38
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:47,420
I might as well just go unless something really, really bad happens here, which I don't know if it will. It might.

39
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:53,060
What the fuck am I going to do? You know, what am I going to do?

40
00:07:53,060 --> 00:08:07,139
Nothing. So let me just make sure. Let's hold on. Is this lined up correctly? Kind of is.

41
00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:20,930
Let me just get it over here. Don't be mad already.

42
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:25,550
I don't know if mad is the right word. I think just disappointed is the right word.

43
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:41,870
I think the word is disappointed. But yeah.

44
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:45,870
What are we at? Ten percent of every frame drop. That's just fantastic.

45
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:53,110
What a great four hundred dollars a month service. Four hundred dollars a month.

46
00:08:53,110 --> 00:09:03,610
Did you hear what I just said? That's a that's reality. Yeah.

47
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:08,230
You just heard me say that. That's Cox business. Works great, doesn't it?

48
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:25,509
No, not at all. Anyways, complain on Twitter.

49
00:09:25,509 --> 00:09:28,509
No, here's what happens when you complain on Twitter, guys.

50
00:09:28,509 --> 00:09:31,509
They have like people that automatically just watch.

51
00:09:31,509 --> 00:09:37,750
Doesn't matter if it's Comcast, Cox, Disney Quest, whatever internet you have. It doesn't matter.

52
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:45,750
There are people that just scope through and try to find people put in hashtags of like hashtag Cox sucks.

53
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:49,750
Comcast sucks. And these support agents just go, hey, what happened? Are you OK?

54
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:56,620
And then you reply to them and they are they are like not even like the base level of technician.

55
00:09:56,620 --> 00:10:01,789
They're like the they like get you in contact with like a base level technician.

56
00:10:01,789 --> 00:10:05,289
They're just there to try to get you to shut up on Twitter.

57
00:10:05,289 --> 00:10:22,779
It's it's stupid. And there are a lot of people that thought that I went.

58
00:10:22,779 --> 00:10:29,049
I still have Comcast. No, I went from this is a completely different company.

59
00:10:29,049 --> 00:10:33,049
This is a new ISP in a new state. It doesn't matter.

60
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:51,159
It's going to be fine. It will fix itself.

61
00:10:51,159 --> 00:10:59,789
It will fix itself. It will. It just for it just for dumb, stupid, random reasons.

62
00:10:59,789 --> 00:11:18,779
It'll just go to like 20 percent of what we pay for for like two hours, three hours in a row.

63
00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:24,460
Stealing Wi-Fi from McDonald's. You know what? It would probably be better.

64
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:28,149
Why can't McDonald's make their own Internet? Think about this for real.

65
00:11:28,149 --> 00:11:32,149
I want you to think about this because people are going to be like, what are you talking about?

66
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:37,220
McDonald's has some of the fastest service ever.

67
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:45,090
You pull up to the window. You order like a bunch of food and this shit is at the window 10 seconds later.

68
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:51,100
I bet you McDonald's could get a burger to the moon and back in less than fucking five seconds if they really wanted to.

69
00:11:51,100 --> 00:12:01,679
I would I would love to pay for a McDonald's Internet.

70
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:07,970
Yeah, because they made it hours ago. So so what?

71
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:11,549
They could make the Internet hours ago.

72
00:12:11,549 --> 00:12:17,549
They could just get the data package and like get it in a fucking box and get it ready and then send it out to customers.

73
00:12:17,549 --> 00:12:23,940
Oh, you're over here now. Hi. Hi, everybody. My name is Jeremy and this is this is called. Let's wait out the Internet.

74
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:28,940
It's a fun game we play. I've been playing it since like 2016. It's very fun.

75
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:32,940
It's an interesting thing. Resident Evil 2 sounds like a fun game to play.

76
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:41,179
It will fix. It's going to it's going to fix itself.

77
00:12:41,179 --> 00:12:45,659
I know it will. Fucking Internet.

78
00:12:45,659 --> 00:12:52,710
Can I have to gonna have to fucking.

79
00:12:52,710 --> 00:13:09,500
Are we going to just silently be angry here until this is like working?

80
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:16,899
I might have to sit here. We're going to have to go full screen then get this off.

81
00:13:16,899 --> 00:13:19,399
Look, it's ready. It's right here.

82
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:22,399
The truck is there. I'm in the goddamn truck.

83
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:25,399
I'm ready to go. And it's stalled out. Look at that.

84
00:13:25,399 --> 00:13:29,279
Oh, no. Oh, no. Sorry.

85
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:32,279
There's pedestrians crossing. Can't really go anywhere.

86
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:35,710
Sorry, Claire. I can't go anywhere. Yeah.

87
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:38,950
Oh, yeah. This is the Internet data is going across.

88
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:42,950
It's like a bunch of ducks. There's like seven thousand of we got to wait here for like four hours.

89
00:13:42,950 --> 00:14:00,250
Well, let's let's go. Let's go ahead and just like do this.

90
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:04,250
Let's figure out what the hell I'm going to even do when I'm allowed to do anything.

91
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:11,000
So we got Leon or Claire. I was going to go Leon because Leon is from the original game.

92
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Claire's from the original game, too.

93
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,000
But it don't use you start with Leon from the original game, right?

94
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:26,230
Do I have this is from my understanding, this is two completely different paths, right?

95
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:30,240
You got it's two completely different campaigns.

96
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:39,120
So that's OK. Do a smart click. I was going to play Leon of a huge fan of Resident Evil 4.

97
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,120
And this is the this is the sequel to Resident Evil 4 backwards.

98
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:58,110
So, you know, maybe if I just like go to the options menu for a while, you guys look, look, look, look.

99
00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:06,039
You guys are going to make fun of my graphics settings for like 10 minutes and then we'll be able to do it.

100
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:12,539
This let me just hold on. I need to like just triple check something here.

101
00:15:12,539 --> 00:15:14,539
I'm going to back out of this for a minute.

102
00:15:14,539 --> 00:15:29,649
How do I exit the game? How do you exit Resident Evil 2? Is there no exit?

103
00:15:29,649 --> 00:15:47,649
How do you exit? Because I need to exit to look at something, but I can't alt tab either.

104
00:15:47,649 --> 00:15:54,879
How do I get out of here? Well, I was going to play Leon.

105
00:15:54,879 --> 00:16:00,629
Assisted standard or hardcore assisted for players who are unfamiliar.

106
00:16:00,629 --> 00:16:03,629
Aim assist recover a certain amount of health automatically and enemies are weaker.

107
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:07,870
I can't do that though. Normal. Hardcore.

108
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:17,179
Saving requires an ink ribbon, no autosave and I don't care about I don't care about the difficulty of the game.

109
00:16:17,179 --> 00:16:22,379
It's the saving that I know we're not doing that.

110
00:16:22,379 --> 00:16:42,399
That looks absolutely delicious. Holy shit.

111
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:50,710
Is that a triple? Is that a quadruple? One, two, how many patties are in there?

112
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:57,090
That's at least two or three patties. He's eating the he's eating the wrapper too, I think.

113
00:16:57,090 --> 00:17:01,580
That's what you don't, you can't eat and drive.

114
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:04,579
You might accidentally eat the wrapper. It's happened to me a couple times.

115
00:17:04,579 --> 00:17:18,940
And I'm in the passenger seat, by the way.

116
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:37,119
He's gonna crash into something. What? No, no, not good.

117
00:17:37,119 --> 00:17:46,609
For a second I thought he just flew out of the car. I was like, hold on, what happened?

118
00:17:46,609 --> 00:18:04,420
Truck driver with a truck driver hat on.

119
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:27,140
That's a truck on that hat, isn't there? Just in case you were wondering what he did for a living.

120
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:32,440
What's the thing with Leon? It's Leon's birthday today, right? It's like his 18th birthday.

121
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:55,420
It's his first day on the 18th birthday. There he is.

122
00:18:55,420 --> 00:19:14,980
Turn up the game? I will. I just have no control over the game right now. Don't worry.

123
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:26,750
We are open. Let's go.

124
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:38,910
All right, so let me explore your surroundings. Not yet, because I need to turn this up.

125
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:42,910
How bad is it? Is the internet still fucking bad? Are we still having problems here?

126
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:52,740
Stop dropping frames. I wish I could stop it.

127
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:58,220
You know, I do have to turn the lights off. It doesn't make any sense like this.

128
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:11,400
It's a little better, right? No. I'm like so out of place here.

129
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:29,339
There we go. Let's bring this down.

130
00:20:29,339 --> 00:20:44,579
Now it looks like I actually belong in here. It's like darker. It's a little scarier, right?

131
00:20:44,579 --> 00:20:47,579
I can already see people making fun of my sideburn. I can see it.

132
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:50,579
I don't even have to look at it in chat. I already know you're doing it.

133
00:20:50,579 --> 00:20:55,650
All right. Pray that we get our internet back, but I'm just going to go.

134
00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:57,650
What can I do, right?

135
00:20:57,650 --> 00:20:59,650
Okay, here we go. Explore surroundings.

136
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:06,339
Speaking of brightness, this monitor is too bright.

137
00:21:06,339 --> 00:21:11,589
How do I turn the brightness down on this?

138
00:21:11,589 --> 00:21:21,130
Oh, I can just turn it off. But then I can't see chat.

139
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:34,660
Hold on. I got it. Oh, you piece of shit.

140
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:43,380
There we go. All right. That's better.

141
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:49,140
And yeah, I'm going to do whatever I can to stall because like fuck this internet.

142
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:52,980
All right. Explore surroundings.

143
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:54,980
Now I can actually fucking breathe.

144
00:21:54,980 --> 00:22:00,990
Now we got a fire extinguisher. We got a gas pump.

145
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:05,000
Explore. Let's go take a look at the highway.

146
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:13,789
I'm just going to walk home. Beautiful game though.

147
00:22:13,789 --> 00:22:27,849
It says explore your surroundings. It didn't say how far.

148
00:22:27,849 --> 00:22:28,849
Nothing out here.

149
00:22:28,849 --> 00:22:31,849
Okay. See, I want to make sure I know exactly what's going on.

150
00:22:31,849 --> 00:22:35,660
And we had an anonymous five gifted subs.

151
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:39,420
Thank you from anonymous.

152
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:43,359
I got to check the other way too. There could, there might be mutants out there.

153
00:22:43,359 --> 00:22:45,359
Hold on. I see an item in the distance.

154
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:48,359
That is a twinkling item on the ground over there.

155
00:22:48,359 --> 00:22:50,359
And half of you guys didn't even do that.

156
00:22:50,359 --> 00:22:53,660
See it all the way down there. You see the red, the orange and red.

157
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:59,740
I'm going to pick it up. It's going to be an Easter egg.

158
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:03,740
And then I'm going to be on the front page of every fucking subreddit.

159
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:18,019
Nevermind. I have to find a way to stall.

160
00:23:18,019 --> 00:23:21,019
Because this is 7,000 drop frames guys.

161
00:23:21,019 --> 00:23:24,019
I've been looking forward to this game for like fucking 30 years.

162
00:23:24,019 --> 00:23:37,480
And you want me to like do it with like 20% drop frames?

163
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,480
Okay. Here's the cop car.

164
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:46,440
I'm just, we're just going to go in.

165
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,440
There's hamburgers in here. This is where the guy got the hamburger.

166
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:50,440
Okay. Let's just open the door.

167
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:55,599
But wait, this is important. Is this the part?

168
00:23:55,599 --> 00:23:58,099
Hello? Anybody there?

169
00:23:58,099 --> 00:24:07,269
I didn't even get to say my piece. How infuriating.

170
00:24:07,269 --> 00:24:09,269
Something's not right.

171
00:24:09,269 --> 00:24:14,069
458. I just heard something.

172
00:24:14,069 --> 00:24:21,859
Up in the ceiling.

173
00:24:21,859 --> 00:24:23,859
There's a guy crawling around in like the vent right now.

174
00:24:23,859 --> 00:24:25,859
All right. Let's take a look around.

175
00:24:25,859 --> 00:24:31,940
Ketchup.

176
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:34,940
Now that's all right. That's Heinz 57 sauce.

177
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:35,940
It's gross.

178
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:37,940
But after you eat it for more than like a couple minutes,

179
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:39,940
like four or five french fries in, you forget how gross it is.

180
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:42,940
And you start thinking it's actually kind of good.

181
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:48,960
You all right?

182
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,329
Don't move. I'll be back for you.

183
00:24:51,329 --> 00:24:58,539
They're going to bite in the neck.

184
00:24:58,539 --> 00:25:00,539
He's going to get it from behind.

185
00:25:00,539 --> 00:25:20,900
Officer, you need help?

186
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:22,900
Stay back, sir. I got this.

187
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:24,900
Never take your eyes.

188
00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:35,700
Oh my God. That's fucking so horrible looking.

189
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:38,190
Jesus.

190
00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:40,190
Freeze. I'll shoot.

191
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:50,029
What?

192
00:25:50,029 --> 00:25:52,660
That was so ridiculous.

193
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:54,960
That was every tendon.

194
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,960
There's points in there.

195
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,960
Fluid. That was horrible.

196
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,710
Showing off their new engine, huh?

197
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:06,059
There's a key.

198
00:26:06,059 --> 00:26:08,059
Key is the inventory. Put it in here.

199
00:26:08,059 --> 00:26:10,059
So you hold items and weapons, right?

200
00:26:10,059 --> 00:26:12,880
Okay. Fine.

201
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:19,599
Escape from the store.

202
00:26:19,599 --> 00:26:21,599
I might have to adjust the sensitivity on the...

203
00:26:21,599 --> 00:26:24,859
Okay, I thought the shadow was a person.

204
00:26:24,859 --> 00:26:26,859
God damn it. Where is he?

205
00:26:26,859 --> 00:26:29,680
Oh, fuck.

206
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:36,269
How?

207
00:26:36,269 --> 00:26:38,269
Don't even shoot him, right?

208
00:26:38,269 --> 00:26:43,140
Conserving ammo.

209
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:45,140
I've already used like 30 bullets.

210
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:53,900
Come on. There's got to be like 30 bullets in here.

211
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:57,490
The store...

212
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:59,490
The guy's going to get up.

213
00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:01,490
And he's going to fucking burst through the door.

214
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:07,059
Hold on.

215
00:27:07,059 --> 00:27:13,259
Let's just go through there.

216
00:27:13,259 --> 00:27:15,259
When you need to use an item to unlock a door or solve a puzzle,

217
00:27:15,259 --> 00:27:17,259
select the item and then use the use command.

218
00:27:17,259 --> 00:27:19,700
Would make sense, wouldn't it?

219
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:25,390
He's going to die in the store.

220
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:27,390
Why would I die in the store?

221
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:29,390
Jesus.

222
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:36,109
Oh, shit. No, no, no, no. How do I...

223
00:27:36,109 --> 00:27:38,109
What's the run command? What's the run command?

224
00:27:38,109 --> 00:27:40,109
What's the run command?

225
00:27:40,109 --> 00:27:48,109
I'm not...

226
00:27:48,109 --> 00:27:52,140
That's clear.

227
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:55,599
The bullets from me, right?

228
00:27:55,599 --> 00:28:03,220
Pretty good gamer reactions.

229
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:05,220
Hey, thanks.

230
00:28:14,589 --> 00:28:21,039
You didn't kill those guys?

231
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:23,039
You're terrible.

232
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:25,039
You're terrible.

233
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:27,789
I killed those guys in my place.

234
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:41,170
Hold on.

235
00:28:41,170 --> 00:28:43,170
Alright, we made it out.

236
00:28:43,170 --> 00:28:47,009
I win. I win. I win.

237
00:28:50,269 --> 00:28:52,269
Huge bits from Great Canadian.

238
00:28:58,819 --> 00:29:00,819
I'm Chris Redfield's daughter, right?

239
00:29:00,819 --> 00:29:03,119
Whatever it is.

240
00:29:03,119 --> 00:29:05,119
Thank you, Great Canadian, for the $50.

241
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,400
Twitch let me resub for free for some reason.

242
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,400
So this will cover it, I hope.

243
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,400
Cover it, like, 50 times.

244
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:21,599
Thank you so much, Great Canadian.

245
00:29:21,599 --> 00:29:25,500
Capcom.

246
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:27,500
This is a Capcom game.

247
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:39,980
Capcom really just killing it lately.

248
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:46,380
What is this?

249
00:29:46,380 --> 00:30:00,980
Just sitting on the desk.

250
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:02,980
Is it watchable? Are we alright?

251
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:04,980
Because I'm still looking over and I'm seeing, like,

252
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:06,980
the red indicator that's, like,

253
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:16,319
stop streaming Jeremy.

254
00:30:16,319 --> 00:30:19,069
Resident Evil 2.

255
00:30:19,069 --> 00:30:21,069
I was going to say earlier that I'm really excited for this game.

256
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:23,069
Not because of the game.

257
00:30:23,069 --> 00:30:25,069
I'm trying to talk.

258
00:30:52,299 --> 00:30:54,299
I mean, technically the zombies are survivors.

259
00:30:54,299 --> 00:30:56,299
Right?

260
00:30:56,299 --> 00:30:58,299
They're not completely dead.

261
00:30:58,299 --> 00:31:11,099
Like, somehow.

262
00:31:11,099 --> 00:31:14,299
They're not dead. They still have brain activity, guys.

263
00:31:14,299 --> 00:31:16,299
You're not dead.

264
00:31:16,299 --> 00:31:18,299
You're not completely dead.

265
00:31:25,599 --> 00:31:32,960
Quick time. Are they quick time events?

266
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:41,390
That's a zombie driving a car.

267
00:31:41,390 --> 00:31:43,390
Are you talking about...

268
00:31:43,390 --> 00:31:45,390
Oh, no, it's not.

269
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:58,079
He's just speeding through.

270
00:31:58,079 --> 00:32:00,769
Oh, he's dead.

271
00:32:00,769 --> 00:32:08,000
Watch out.

272
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:15,549
Dripping oil.

273
00:32:15,549 --> 00:32:18,500
Dripping gasoline.

274
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:23,549
Claire was probably in there, right?

275
00:32:23,549 --> 00:32:27,009
That's what I'm thinking.

276
00:32:27,009 --> 00:32:29,700
What is this?

277
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:33,339
This is loud.

278
00:32:33,339 --> 00:32:35,339
We're going to have to turn the game down a little.

279
00:32:40,859 --> 00:32:44,829
I remember this from the first one.

280
00:32:44,829 --> 00:32:47,140
Oh, it's a guardian?

281
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:52,190
I gotta get out of here.

282
00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:54,190
I gotta run.

283
00:32:56,819 --> 00:32:58,819
Uh...

284
00:32:58,819 --> 00:33:01,869
What's the run button?

285
00:33:01,869 --> 00:33:03,869
How do you run?

286
00:33:03,869 --> 00:33:06,430
I don't want to shoot. There's like 50 people there.

287
00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:08,430
I just want to run.

288
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:11,250
Capcom, what's the run button?

289
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:19,440
Just tell me what the run button is.

290
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:27,380
Is there no run in this game?

291
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:29,380
Press in left stick.

292
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:31,380
That would have been great to know.

293
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:35,789
You know, just kill me.

294
00:33:35,789 --> 00:33:37,789
Somebody kill me. Kill me.

295
00:33:37,789 --> 00:33:40,670
Do it. Just bite my fucking neck open.

296
00:33:40,670 --> 00:33:42,670
Kill me.

297
00:33:42,670 --> 00:33:45,740
Just like every other game.

298
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:47,740
No, it's like B or A holding it.

299
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:56,829
No, it was actually X in the original one.

300
00:33:56,829 --> 00:33:58,829
It was the face button here.

301
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:05,420
That's how Leon dies.

302
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:07,420
Let's check out Claire's side of the view.

303
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:09,420
Let's check out Claire's view.

304
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:11,420
No, wait. No, no, no.

305
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:16,610
Hold on. I wanted to...

306
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:18,610
No, that's fine.

307
00:34:18,610 --> 00:34:23,860
I wanted to alt-tab before and I can't.

308
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:27,949
Just stop there for a second.

309
00:34:27,949 --> 00:34:29,949
Do I really have to pull this out of borderless window

310
00:34:29,949 --> 00:34:31,949
to alt-tab the game?

311
00:34:31,949 --> 00:34:39,679
Because I can't move.

312
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:44,159
Hold on. Get out of the way for a second game.

313
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:47,619
Okay. Okay, okay, okay.

314
00:34:47,619 --> 00:34:50,050
I'm just making sure I don't have anything open

315
00:34:50,050 --> 00:34:52,050
that would be using any resources.

316
00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:54,050
But I don't.

317
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:56,050
It was a long shot but it was worth a try.

318
00:34:56,050 --> 00:35:01,170
Another huge amount of money just came in.

319
00:35:01,170 --> 00:35:03,409
That was from

320
00:35:03,409 --> 00:35:05,409
Miniclips.

321
00:35:05,409 --> 00:35:07,409
Thank you, Miniclips, for the $50.

322
00:35:07,409 --> 00:35:13,170
Off to a good start. Keep it up.

323
00:35:13,170 --> 00:35:15,469
Thank you so much for the $50.

324
00:35:15,469 --> 00:35:20,719
No, I tried to bait him.

325
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:22,719
You blame Cox for this.

326
00:35:22,719 --> 00:35:24,719
Because I'm like, I'm like,

327
00:35:24,719 --> 00:35:27,920
how many frames did you just drop today?

328
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,920
Blame this dog shit internet company.

329
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:41,420
Alright, let's go.

330
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:43,420
So which way should I go? This way?

331
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:49,170
Into the alley?

332
00:35:49,170 --> 00:35:51,170
Oh, fuck.

333
00:35:51,170 --> 00:35:54,179
Aging boomer can't

334
00:35:54,179 --> 00:35:57,889
figure out internet.

335
00:35:57,889 --> 00:35:59,889
No, it's called a bunch of fucking workers

336
00:35:59,889 --> 00:36:01,889
just throw up a bunch of lines.

337
00:36:01,889 --> 00:36:05,019
Bury a bunch of fucking lines.

338
00:36:05,019 --> 00:36:07,019
Don't even care if it works.

339
00:36:07,019 --> 00:36:09,019
They just build it. And then the company

340
00:36:09,019 --> 00:36:11,019
that is responsible for it

341
00:36:11,019 --> 00:36:13,019
just kind of goes, does it work?

342
00:36:13,019 --> 00:36:15,019
Yeah, it technically works.

343
00:36:15,019 --> 00:36:17,019
Alright, then fucking just turn it on for everybody. Who cares?

344
00:36:17,019 --> 00:36:20,289
I don't know, there might be like a problem.

345
00:36:20,289 --> 00:36:22,289
I think there's like water down there.

346
00:36:22,289 --> 00:36:24,289
No, I fucking just turn it on for everybody. Who cares?

347
00:36:24,289 --> 00:36:38,369
How much would it cost for us to like fix that?

348
00:36:38,369 --> 00:36:40,800
Like 40 grand?

349
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,099
I don't know about that.

350
00:36:43,099 --> 00:36:45,099
How much did we take in last month from subscriptions?

351
00:36:45,099 --> 00:36:47,099
12 million.

352
00:36:47,099 --> 00:36:49,099
No, I don't know about that.

353
00:36:49,099 --> 00:36:51,099
I don't think that's worth it.

354
00:36:51,099 --> 00:36:53,099
No, no, just keep it on. Turn it on.

355
00:36:53,099 --> 00:36:56,690
No, hold on. I gotta pay attention. Hold on.

356
00:36:56,690 --> 00:37:16,769
It's like seriously.

357
00:37:16,769 --> 00:37:19,139
I bet you whatever this problem is

358
00:37:19,139 --> 00:37:21,139
could be solved if just somebody

359
00:37:21,139 --> 00:37:24,079
gave a shit.

360
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:26,079
You know what I mean? Like

361
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:28,079
if anybody, if anybody

362
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:30,079
from here to here just gave a shit

363
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:33,019
this wouldn't happen.

364
00:37:33,019 --> 00:37:42,239
Oh, I remember this place. This is the police station.

365
00:37:42,239 --> 00:37:45,440
Jerma is mad.

366
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:47,440
I am because it's fucking stupid.

367
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,940
Hello? Is anybody here?

368
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:54,670
And they go bolts. Alright, that's six.

369
00:37:54,670 --> 00:37:56,670
You get six handgun ammo.

370
00:37:56,670 --> 00:38:00,639
Takes up a spot in the inventory, right?

371
00:38:00,639 --> 00:38:05,440
Okay, we got a

372
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,440
RPD. This is the storage box.

373
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,809
And a save point.

374
00:38:09,809 --> 00:38:11,809
Thank god I don't have to do the

375
00:38:11,809 --> 00:38:13,809
hardcore ribbon shit.

376
00:38:13,809 --> 00:38:19,179
Sometimes there's stuff in the boxes

377
00:38:19,179 --> 00:38:21,179
but I think a key, well-worn

378
00:38:21,179 --> 00:38:23,809
key. I don't

379
00:38:23,809 --> 00:38:25,809
think I'm gonna need this. This is the key to the

380
00:38:25,809 --> 00:38:31,760
store. Uh, probably shouldn't

381
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:37,969
have this anymore. Right?

382
00:38:37,969 --> 00:38:39,969
I mean is that, that's not like a

383
00:38:39,969 --> 00:38:41,969
skeleton key, right?

384
00:38:41,969 --> 00:38:47,789
Do I write for IGN?

385
00:38:47,789 --> 00:38:53,230
What?

386
00:39:04,179 --> 00:39:06,739
Watch out! There's Chickie over there on the bottom

387
00:39:06,739 --> 00:39:09,300
right camera. Check camera, no, no

388
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:11,300
camera three. Freddy's on camera

389
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:17,440
three. Go check it.

390
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:26,719
You guys wouldn't believe it.

391
00:39:26,719 --> 00:39:29,280
Doesn't matter. Like when I was

392
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,280
in, when I was in Massachusetts

393
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:34,030
and now I'm fucking in Las Vegas. Doesn't matter.

394
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:36,030
You know how many people you have to go through

395
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:38,030
before you find the guy that's like, yeah I guess

396
00:39:38,030 --> 00:39:40,849
I'll take care of that. Like

397
00:39:40,849 --> 00:39:42,849
this is just like super ultra

398
00:39:42,849 --> 00:39:45,019
company bullshit. There's a

399
00:39:45,019 --> 00:39:47,019
guy that you have to talk to to see if you

400
00:39:47,019 --> 00:39:49,019
have a real problem. Then that guy has to talk

401
00:39:49,019 --> 00:39:51,019
to another guy above him about how your problem's real.

402
00:39:51,019 --> 00:39:53,019
That guy then has to be

403
00:39:53,019 --> 00:39:55,019
currently caring about your current situation to talk

404
00:39:55,019 --> 00:39:57,019
to the guy above him to say

405
00:39:57,019 --> 00:39:59,019
we have to fix the problem that's going on with the guy. Guy

406
00:39:59,019 --> 00:40:01,019
five below me said there was an issue but

407
00:40:01,019 --> 00:40:03,019
Guy two said it might not be an issue. Guy

408
00:40:03,019 --> 00:40:05,019
eleven, that's like the regional

409
00:40:05,019 --> 00:40:23,969
manager. Jerma stop it's

410
00:40:23,969 --> 00:40:27,489
getting annoying. Like

411
00:40:27,489 --> 00:40:29,489
this? You're talking about like me dropping

412
00:40:29,489 --> 00:40:31,489
a dickload of frames.

413
00:40:31,489 --> 00:40:40,320
That is annoying, you're right.

414
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:42,320
Alright put gun in circle left.

415
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:49,360
Bullets in circle right.

416
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:52,050
Alright so

417
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:58,190
do I have a knife yet? I don't think I do.

418
00:40:58,190 --> 00:41:04,659
Not yet. Can you please adjust

419
00:41:04,659 --> 00:41:07,409
your internet? Alright so I need

420
00:41:07,409 --> 00:41:09,780
to go. Let's

421
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:12,340
So here's the map.

422
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:14,340
The map is very useful

423
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:16,340
for more than just your current location and surroundings.

424
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:18,340
It will also show you points of interest in items you have found

425
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:23,780
and haven't picked up yet.

426
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:26,460
Oh that's cool. Taped box.

427
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:28,900
Goddess statue. So it will tell you pretty much

428
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:30,900
everything in the room. That's really cool.

429
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:33,199
The door over here, I wonder

430
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:35,500
if I can open it. Let's find out.

431
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:45,230
You probably have a bunch of

432
00:41:45,230 --> 00:41:47,539
torrents seating. I would

433
00:41:47,539 --> 00:41:49,840
be very surprised. I need

434
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,840
the spade key to open this door which I do not have.

435
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:53,840
So let's go take a look upstairs.

436
00:41:53,840 --> 00:42:12,900
Let me see. Two doors

437
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:15,329
up here. How is this one?

438
00:42:15,329 --> 00:42:18,019
This one opens. Alright isn't there like

439
00:42:18,019 --> 00:42:20,019
a police chief in here?

440
00:42:20,019 --> 00:42:28,320
From what I remember.

441
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:32,480
Somebody above? Alright I got the herb.

442
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:34,780
Uh

443
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:36,780
combining herbs. I'm going to have to remember

444
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:41,139
this shit. This safe.

445
00:42:41,139 --> 00:42:43,889
Anybody know? No don't tell me the combination.

446
00:42:43,889 --> 00:43:00,260
I don't want to know. Shit. Alright we got

447
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:02,260
a photograph here. Guide

448
00:43:02,260 --> 00:43:04,260
pamphlet. Welcome to Raccoon City.

449
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:06,260
Did you know? Well we are the home

450
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:08,260
of pharmaceutical giant umbrella corporation.

451
00:43:08,260 --> 00:43:10,260
Raccoon City is a vibrant and dynamic

452
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:12,260
city with a long rich history of its own.

453
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:14,260
In this guide we'll introduce you to a few more

454
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:16,260
unusual points of interest.

455
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:19,010
The police station.

456
00:43:19,010 --> 00:43:21,179
Inside the police station

457
00:43:21,179 --> 00:43:24,059
there are

458
00:43:24,059 --> 00:43:26,059
the skipping makes my webcam look

459
00:43:26,059 --> 00:43:28,059
pre-recorded. Look. Ready? It's not

460
00:43:28,059 --> 00:43:30,059
one, two, three. See?

461
00:43:30,059 --> 00:43:32,750
Various features like the unusual clock

462
00:43:32,750 --> 00:43:34,750
tower. Yeah, yeah. This is an orphanage.

463
00:43:34,750 --> 00:43:36,750
It's pretty cool.

464
00:43:36,750 --> 00:43:41,230
Any more points of interest?

465
00:43:41,230 --> 00:43:43,230
There is the safe. That's it.

466
00:43:43,230 --> 00:43:45,230
This door needs a spade key. I don't have it.

467
00:43:45,230 --> 00:43:49,250
So let's keep going.

468
00:43:49,250 --> 00:43:52,449
What do we got here for Coca-Cola?

469
00:43:52,449 --> 00:43:54,449
We got Campa, Arta,

470
00:43:54,449 --> 00:43:56,940
food,

471
00:43:56,940 --> 00:44:00,380
food.

472
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:02,380
Crack open a food soda.

473
00:44:02,380 --> 00:44:10,059
It's also across the hall.

474
00:44:10,059 --> 00:44:12,369
And then I could leave and

475
00:44:12,369 --> 00:44:14,739
check the other parts of the town.

476
00:44:14,739 --> 00:44:22,219
But let's just see what's up here first.

477
00:44:22,219 --> 00:44:24,219
Another puzzle with some

478
00:44:24,219 --> 00:44:26,849
dials on it.

479
00:44:26,849 --> 00:44:29,469
All information that will be presented

480
00:44:29,469 --> 00:44:31,469
in some way or another.

481
00:44:31,469 --> 00:44:36,460
I'm going to have to get my notebook.

482
00:44:36,460 --> 00:44:38,460
Spade key as well.

483
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:43,579
I cannot go in any of these rooms.

484
00:44:43,579 --> 00:44:45,579
There are bullets up here, which is good.

485
00:44:45,579 --> 00:44:49,230
And that leaves us with

486
00:44:49,230 --> 00:44:54,929
going back downstairs.

487
00:44:54,929 --> 00:44:56,929
Pre-recorded? Confirmed?

488
00:44:56,929 --> 00:44:59,170
Oh, you want me to dab?

489
00:44:59,170 --> 00:45:01,170
Well, that's not going to happen. Just use the emote

490
00:45:01,170 --> 00:45:06,159
and pretend I did it. Just pretend

491
00:45:06,159 --> 00:45:11,019
I did it with the emote.

492
00:45:11,019 --> 00:45:13,650
So let's go back out.

493
00:45:13,650 --> 00:45:15,650
This is the interrogation room.

494
00:45:15,650 --> 00:45:19,300
Let's save first, just so I have a clean slate.

495
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:21,300
Can't get in there, can't get in there, can't get in there.

496
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:28,530
You dabbed?

497
00:45:28,530 --> 00:45:30,530
Well, I did just wipe my nose.

498
00:45:30,530 --> 00:45:33,219
You're not completely wrong here.

499
00:45:33,219 --> 00:45:35,219
First aid spray.

500
00:45:35,219 --> 00:45:39,250
Pick it up.

501
00:45:39,250 --> 00:45:41,250
Did I miss? I didn't miss anything down here.

502
00:45:41,250 --> 00:45:43,250
I better not have.

503
00:45:43,250 --> 00:45:55,389
Did I crawl under here?

504
00:45:55,389 --> 00:46:06,190
Alright.

505
00:46:06,190 --> 00:46:08,190
It says keep out, but that's alright.

506
00:46:08,190 --> 00:46:14,659
I'll go in. So you got company yet?

507
00:46:14,659 --> 00:46:26,940
You got guy like number 11.

508
00:46:26,940 --> 00:46:32,380
Alright, I need to fuse.

509
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:44,670
Nothing back there. Let's just go.

510
00:46:44,670 --> 00:46:46,670
East office. Let's check the office.

511
00:46:46,670 --> 00:46:49,039
If I can. I can't.

512
00:46:49,039 --> 00:47:03,699
I'm going to be so meticulous here, guys.

513
00:47:03,699 --> 00:47:06,829
I'm sorry, I have to.

514
00:47:06,829 --> 00:47:11,039
What's this? Don't talk.

515
00:47:11,039 --> 00:47:13,539
Why would you talk?

516
00:47:13,539 --> 00:47:24,420
My press room is right here to the left.

517
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:30,619
God damn it. Okay.

518
00:47:30,619 --> 00:47:32,619
Press room. Turn the lights on.

519
00:47:32,619 --> 00:47:35,179
Ooh, bullets. Nice.

520
00:47:35,179 --> 00:47:37,179
Only three? How did you only have three bullets?

521
00:47:37,179 --> 00:47:41,409
You didn't come prepared.

522
00:47:41,409 --> 00:47:43,409
Alright, finally. Good.

523
00:47:43,409 --> 00:47:50,510
I can actually see what the hell I'm doing.

524
00:47:50,510 --> 00:47:52,510
I can think of a pretty good joke here where I give a fake speech

525
00:47:52,510 --> 00:47:54,750
like I'm talking to the press.

526
00:47:54,750 --> 00:47:56,750
But it would just devolve into me talking about cocks.

527
00:47:56,750 --> 00:47:59,570
So, I'm not going to do that.

528
00:47:59,570 --> 00:48:10,449
No!

529
00:48:10,449 --> 00:48:12,449
It's the

530
00:48:12,449 --> 00:48:14,449
name of the terrible

531
00:48:14,449 --> 00:48:22,130
company.

532
00:48:22,130 --> 00:48:25,070
Did I miss?

533
00:48:25,070 --> 00:48:27,070
All typewriter shaped objects, save points?

534
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:34,539
I guess not.

535
00:48:34,539 --> 00:48:36,539
Do the speech. No, I'm not.

536
00:48:36,539 --> 00:48:42,030
No speeches.

537
00:48:42,030 --> 00:48:44,030
No speeches, just

538
00:48:44,030 --> 00:48:46,030
sunny beaches.

539
00:48:46,030 --> 00:48:56,780
No speeches, sunny beaches.

540
00:48:56,780 --> 00:49:10,989
Okay, I'm good. Cleaning in progress.

541
00:49:10,989 --> 00:49:14,639
Hydrate.

542
00:49:14,639 --> 00:49:16,820
Yep. It's over here.

543
00:49:16,820 --> 00:49:20,590
Got a bathroom.

544
00:49:20,590 --> 00:49:22,590
And, alright, what's in the bathroom?

545
00:49:22,590 --> 00:49:27,969
It's not really going to be in the stall.

546
00:49:27,969 --> 00:49:31,420
But there was the door closing behind me.

547
00:49:31,420 --> 00:49:35,389
There's going to be a person in one of these stalls.

548
00:49:35,389 --> 00:49:37,389
This is a horror game.

549
00:49:37,389 --> 00:49:52,800
Nope. Just the wet bandits

550
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:56,260
that's all.

551
00:49:56,260 --> 00:50:00,989
No bullets or anything in here? Why even let me come in here?

552
00:50:00,989 --> 00:50:10,900
What was that?

553
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:22,530
Lantern? Can I like pick up the

554
00:50:22,530 --> 00:50:30,210
lantern? No, I don't think so.

555
00:50:30,210 --> 00:50:32,210
Blind. He's blind. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. What do you mean he's blind?

556
00:50:32,210 --> 00:50:36,300
Did I miss something?

557
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:43,260
What did I miss?

558
00:50:43,260 --> 00:50:45,260
I thought it was like hairspray. I didn't think it was like

559
00:50:45,260 --> 00:50:47,500
a healing item.

560
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:49,500
I thought that was like shhh for your

561
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:55,900
head. I'm going to sneeze.

562
00:50:55,900 --> 00:51:08,420
Okay.

563
00:51:08,420 --> 00:51:10,420
What's in here? Coffee.

564
00:51:10,420 --> 00:51:12,420
I could use some right now.

565
00:51:12,420 --> 00:51:18,619
Jesus.

566
00:51:18,619 --> 00:51:20,619
This is something wrong here.

567
00:51:20,619 --> 00:51:22,619
This is something

568
00:51:22,619 --> 00:51:24,860
wrong here. I'm just going to leave

569
00:51:24,860 --> 00:51:26,860
it. Maybe I can shoot it off.

570
00:51:26,860 --> 00:51:29,659
It's possible. Although that's a waste

571
00:51:29,659 --> 00:51:33,309
of a bullet, isn't it? We just had

572
00:51:33,309 --> 00:51:35,309
five community subs come in from Herbert.

573
00:51:35,309 --> 00:51:37,309
Thank you, Herbert, for the five community subs.

574
00:51:37,309 --> 00:51:39,550
Congratulations to all of you that got a community

575
00:51:39,550 --> 00:51:45,230
sub.

576
00:51:45,230 --> 00:51:47,599
Where?

577
00:51:47,599 --> 00:51:49,599
No, wrong one. Sorry.

578
00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:53,380
Are you still alive?

579
00:51:53,380 --> 00:51:55,380
I can't open the door, dude. I'm sorry. The door

580
00:51:55,380 --> 00:51:57,739
is locked. Just he's blocking

581
00:51:57,739 --> 00:52:03,630
it with his body.

582
00:52:03,630 --> 00:52:07,139
Oh, he's talking about here.

583
00:52:07,139 --> 00:52:12,579
I've got cash.

584
00:52:12,579 --> 00:52:15,710
I'll take that cash.

585
00:52:15,710 --> 00:52:32,289
Quick. Put him back under the rug.

586
00:52:32,289 --> 00:52:46,690
Put him back under. My God.

587
00:52:46,690 --> 00:52:48,690
That's disgusting. It's ridiculous.

588
00:52:48,690 --> 00:52:51,119
Officers notebook.

589
00:52:51,119 --> 00:52:53,119
OK, hold on. Goddess statue.

590
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:55,119
And then we get three. Three medallions.

591
00:52:55,119 --> 00:52:58,130
This guy was just playing the game.

592
00:52:58,130 --> 00:53:00,500
He was almost done with

593
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:03,570
figuring it out. So

594
00:53:03,570 --> 00:53:05,570
the statue that goes down underneath.

595
00:53:05,570 --> 00:53:08,000
So after you put the three medallions

596
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
in, you can go through underneath

597
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:14,929
the statue and then get out.

598
00:53:14,929 --> 00:53:16,929
OK, so we got

599
00:53:16,929 --> 00:53:19,230
some symbols here.

600
00:53:19,230 --> 00:53:21,230
Which now will allow us to go to the

601
00:53:21,230 --> 00:53:23,230
symbol machine and spin it around until we get

602
00:53:23,230 --> 00:53:27,199
out of here. OK.

603
00:53:27,199 --> 00:53:30,579
Do you have anything out here?

604
00:53:30,579 --> 00:53:35,869
Whoa!

605
00:53:35,869 --> 00:53:48,989
Oh, fuck. OK.

606
00:53:48,989 --> 00:53:54,670
Take a left up here.

607
00:53:54,670 --> 00:53:56,670
Left and then left.

608
00:53:56,670 --> 00:54:00,380
No, let's get to the fuse box.

609
00:54:00,380 --> 00:54:11,840
Yeah, no, that'll work. Let's go.

610
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:13,840
Jesus! They're everywhere.

611
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:33,409
Ah! Point precision. Sometimes

612
00:54:33,409 --> 00:54:35,409
you have to be good at it, you know.

613
00:54:35,409 --> 00:54:37,409
You've got to be prepared sometimes.

614
00:54:37,409 --> 00:54:39,409
Quick time.

615
00:54:39,409 --> 00:54:45,860
Brush his head.

616
00:54:45,860 --> 00:54:48,670
Nice work.

617
00:54:48,670 --> 00:54:54,800
There, there's the chief.

618
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:02,880
Stock sound effects.

619
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:22,960
Alright, so now I have the...

620
00:55:35,630 --> 00:55:37,630
I'm not going to mention his stomach.

621
00:55:39,940 --> 00:55:42,690
Hey, dude, I got some spray paint

622
00:55:42,690 --> 00:55:44,690
for that wound.

623
00:56:12,559 --> 00:56:15,570
Just open your mouth.

624
00:56:18,130 --> 00:56:21,070
Stop.

625
00:56:21,070 --> 00:56:23,070
I can't take your lightsaber.

626
00:56:23,070 --> 00:56:25,070
Take it. Fine.

627
00:56:25,070 --> 00:56:27,889
A Jedi never can give up his lightsaber.

628
00:56:56,059 --> 00:57:00,670
Knife.

629
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:17,440
What? OK.

630
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:19,440
How do I repair it?

631
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:21,440
Do I only get one knife with one

632
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:23,440
bar of damage I'm allowed to do?

633
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:28,690
OK. Left bumper

634
00:57:28,690 --> 00:57:31,309
and rod. Is it not equipped?

635
00:57:47,739 --> 00:57:49,739
Interestingly enough, I'm looking at the same thing over here.

636
00:57:49,739 --> 00:57:52,369
I'm looking at my...

637
00:57:52,369 --> 00:57:54,369
I'm going to give you a Cox internet dog shit

638
00:57:54,369 --> 00:57:56,369
reference, right?

639
00:57:56,369 --> 00:57:58,369
The green is fine. I've been yellow this whole time

640
00:57:58,369 --> 00:58:00,369
and then sometimes it drops to danger

641
00:58:00,369 --> 00:58:02,989
for an hour straight.

642
00:58:02,989 --> 00:58:04,989
What a great reference. He's still angry and he won't get over it.

643
00:58:04,989 --> 00:58:06,989
I can't get over it. It's not going to happen.

644
00:58:06,989 --> 00:58:11,519
Alright, so it's equipped.

645
00:58:11,519 --> 00:58:13,519
OK, so you have to hit them both

646
00:58:13,519 --> 00:58:15,889
to...

647
00:58:15,889 --> 00:58:18,130
I guess not, OK.

648
00:58:18,130 --> 00:58:20,130
I'm not using durability.

649
00:58:20,130 --> 00:58:23,579
Thanks for the jump scare.

650
00:58:23,579 --> 00:58:26,019
For whoever just called me.

651
00:58:26,019 --> 00:58:29,150
Alright, let's go.

652
00:58:29,150 --> 00:58:31,150
I've got to go back up here.

653
00:58:31,150 --> 00:58:39,469
So let's see the symbols.

654
00:58:39,469 --> 00:58:42,159
We can go...

655
00:58:42,159 --> 00:58:45,489
Looks like I have a notebook.

656
00:58:45,489 --> 00:58:48,429
Should I go lion?

657
00:58:48,429 --> 00:58:50,429
Lion, witch, or wardrobe? Which one?

658
00:58:50,429 --> 00:58:52,929
I'm going to go...

659
00:58:52,929 --> 00:58:54,929
Lion's just right here.

660
00:58:54,929 --> 00:58:57,739
So we need lion,

661
00:58:57,739 --> 00:58:59,739
herb, and then dove.

662
00:58:59,739 --> 00:59:09,659
This is going to take us to...

663
00:59:09,659 --> 00:59:14,139
There we go.

664
00:59:14,139 --> 00:59:16,139
Thank you, lion medallion.

665
00:59:16,139 --> 00:59:20,690
I've got to put something in the box.

666
00:59:20,690 --> 00:59:23,250
Next one is...

667
00:59:23,250 --> 00:59:26,320
Lady arrow snake.

668
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:35,469
I can't do it again.

669
00:59:35,469 --> 00:59:42,300
Oh, OK.

670
00:59:42,300 --> 00:59:44,610
Well, might as well just put it in.

671
00:59:44,610 --> 00:59:54,530
Cool.

672
00:59:54,530 --> 00:59:57,730
Alright.

673
00:59:57,730 --> 00:59:59,730
I need two more.

674
00:59:59,730 --> 01:00:06,059
What are you playing over there?

675
01:00:06,059 --> 01:00:08,820
Alright, now let's see.

676
01:00:08,820 --> 01:00:12,269
I had...

677
01:00:12,269 --> 01:00:14,269
East office. Let's save it.

678
01:00:14,269 --> 01:00:24,449
I could use the

679
01:00:24,449 --> 01:00:27,070
heal, but

680
01:00:27,070 --> 01:00:30,269
I don't think I need to yet.

681
01:00:30,269 --> 01:00:32,900
I could use the herb, but you can combine

682
01:00:32,900 --> 01:00:34,900
herbs and shit in this game.

683
01:00:34,900 --> 01:00:38,860
I'm not going to do it yet.

684
01:00:38,860 --> 01:00:40,860
Why am I being selfish? Give him the first aid spray.

685
01:00:40,860 --> 01:00:49,739
OK.

686
01:00:49,739 --> 01:00:51,920
So, we've got...

687
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:53,920
OK, go back over here.

688
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:56,099
I don't think I can even leave this way.

689
01:00:56,099 --> 01:00:58,099
Oh, no, the taped boxes right here.

690
01:00:58,099 --> 01:01:00,719
That's right. Let's go check it out.

691
01:01:00,719 --> 01:01:02,960
Why are my graphics so bad?

692
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:05,260
I don't think they are.

693
01:01:05,260 --> 01:01:07,260
What's wrong with my graphics?

694
01:01:07,260 --> 01:01:14,670
Image quality, 100%.

695
01:01:14,670 --> 01:01:16,980
Anti-aliasing.

696
01:01:16,980 --> 01:01:18,980
Texture quality, high.

697
01:01:18,980 --> 01:01:20,980
Texture filter, high.

698
01:01:20,980 --> 01:01:22,980
Mesh quality, medium.

699
01:01:22,980 --> 01:01:24,980
High, on, on, on.

700
01:01:24,980 --> 01:01:28,159
Medium.

701
01:01:28,159 --> 01:01:31,300
High.

702
01:01:31,300 --> 01:01:35,710
What's wrong?

703
01:01:35,710 --> 01:01:41,019
Turned off the bloom? Turned off the motion blur?

704
01:01:41,019 --> 01:01:43,019
Yeah, I'm an old Counter-Strike pro, guys.

705
01:01:43,019 --> 01:01:45,019
I don't put on graphics.

706
01:01:45,019 --> 01:01:47,019
I can see better when there's not a bunch of bloom and shit.

707
01:01:47,019 --> 01:01:57,250
Alright.

708
01:01:57,250 --> 01:01:59,250
I was about to potentially just waste.

709
01:01:59,250 --> 01:02:07,059
Film grain is not on?

710
01:02:07,059 --> 01:02:09,059
What do you mean?

711
01:02:09,059 --> 01:02:11,059
Film grain?

712
01:02:11,059 --> 01:02:13,059
The film grain is off.

713
01:02:13,059 --> 01:02:15,059
At least I thought I turned it off.

714
01:02:15,059 --> 01:02:22,420
Film noise is off? What?

715
01:02:22,420 --> 01:02:35,969
Put it on!

716
01:02:35,969 --> 01:02:37,969
Alright, now let's go. Let's do this.

717
01:02:37,969 --> 01:02:42,510
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

718
01:02:42,510 --> 01:02:44,510
I'm such a hoarder.

719
01:02:44,510 --> 01:02:47,260
Because there's yellow and red herbs too, right?

720
01:02:47,260 --> 01:03:00,059
Dude on the lowest graphics.

721
01:03:00,059 --> 01:03:02,059
I would never.

722
01:03:02,059 --> 01:03:05,389
Alright, let's just leave.

723
01:03:05,389 --> 01:03:14,539
Nothing else in here.

724
01:03:14,539 --> 01:03:19,019
Okay, what do we got?

725
01:03:19,019 --> 01:03:21,969
I'm not gonna, no.

726
01:03:21,969 --> 01:03:23,969
I'm not doing the 3DS port joke again.

727
01:03:23,969 --> 01:03:32,099
Here, I'll do,

728
01:03:32,099 --> 01:03:34,909
here's what I'll do for you.

729
01:03:34,909 --> 01:03:36,909
Because one guy told me to do this.

730
01:03:36,909 --> 01:03:41,969
So, one guy is gonna get it.

731
01:03:41,969 --> 01:03:49,840
We'll do TAA, okay?

732
01:03:49,840 --> 01:03:53,219
That actually looks worse for me.

733
01:03:53,219 --> 01:03:56,030
That looks worse.

734
01:03:56,030 --> 01:03:58,030
It looks like somebody blew, like, cold air

735
01:03:58,030 --> 01:04:09,550
in my eyes.

736
01:04:09,550 --> 01:04:17,099
Honestly, gelatin.

737
01:04:17,099 --> 01:04:24,659
You got anything else you got?

738
01:04:24,659 --> 01:04:32,400
What do you want to do with the window?

739
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:38,289
Okay, I need the

740
01:04:38,289 --> 01:04:40,289
club key.

741
01:04:40,289 --> 01:04:50,849
Something's gonna happen here.

742
01:04:50,849 --> 01:04:52,849
Somebody's gonna attack me.

743
01:04:52,849 --> 01:04:57,460
I'm trying to remember.

744
01:04:57,460 --> 01:04:59,460
Look at how long this hallway is.

745
01:04:59,460 --> 01:05:01,460
This hallway's too long for there not to be

746
01:05:01,460 --> 01:05:04,530
something that comes up.

747
01:05:04,530 --> 01:05:06,530
What do you want me to do with the window here?

748
01:05:06,530 --> 01:05:17,090
Yep.

749
01:05:17,090 --> 01:05:19,329
Okay, I was ready for it.

750
01:05:19,329 --> 01:05:21,329
Open the, open the blinds.

751
01:05:21,329 --> 01:05:28,300
Did you get in? Did you get in?

752
01:05:28,300 --> 01:05:30,300
I think you got in. But wait, is there anything over here?

753
01:05:30,300 --> 01:05:32,300
Any items? Did you get, you got in.

754
01:05:32,300 --> 01:05:38,190
Okay, let's go, go, go, go, go.

755
01:05:38,190 --> 01:05:43,309
They're not smart enough to follow me in here, right?

756
01:05:43,309 --> 01:05:45,619
Okay, there's a way to go that way. Hold on.

757
01:05:45,619 --> 01:05:47,619
What's this? Record of events.

758
01:05:47,619 --> 01:05:49,619
Uh, we're turning the station into a temporary shelter

759
01:05:49,619 --> 01:05:52,300
due to the massive sudden outbreak.

760
01:05:52,300 --> 01:05:54,300
All police personnel have been instructed to make

761
01:05:54,300 --> 01:05:56,860
the safety of the citizens their top priority.

762
01:05:56,860 --> 01:05:58,860
Uh, and then all,

763
01:05:58,860 --> 01:06:02,190
all hell broke loose and it went to shit.

764
01:06:02,190 --> 01:06:04,190
Yeah, it is a lag stream today, unfortunately.

765
01:06:04,190 --> 01:06:09,380
This is wild.

766
01:06:09,380 --> 01:06:12,130
I don't think there was one drop frame at all

767
01:06:12,130 --> 01:06:14,130
two days ago. It's, it's ridiculous

768
01:06:14,130 --> 01:06:16,130
that like, not even two days later,

769
01:06:16,130 --> 01:06:18,130
it's like barely a streamable day.

770
01:06:18,130 --> 01:06:21,780
I wish there was something I could do.

771
01:06:21,780 --> 01:06:27,219
Alright, I got a police station first floor

772
01:06:27,219 --> 01:06:31,699
map, which is good.

773
01:06:31,699 --> 01:06:33,699
Okay, open that up a lot. Good.

774
01:06:33,699 --> 01:06:36,960
So, going over here, this is the safety

775
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:39,389
deposit room. Or towards

776
01:06:39,389 --> 01:06:41,760
the safety deposit room.

777
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:51,809
See if I can, can I open this door?

778
01:06:51,809 --> 01:06:54,690
Yep. I need like

779
01:06:54,690 --> 01:07:06,460
wire cutters or something.

780
01:07:06,460 --> 01:07:09,599
Okay, so can I bang a

781
01:07:09,599 --> 01:07:11,599
left up here into the safety deposit

782
01:07:11,599 --> 01:07:13,599
room or is that, no that was locked, wasn't it?

783
01:07:13,599 --> 01:07:19,099
Can I turn the flashlight off?

784
01:07:19,099 --> 01:07:41,099
Ah, what is this?

785
01:07:41,099 --> 01:07:44,369
More handgun ammo?

786
01:07:44,369 --> 01:07:46,670
Alright, I got a lot of ammo, so I

787
01:07:46,670 --> 01:07:48,670
should be okay to at least shoot somebody once.

788
01:07:48,670 --> 01:07:53,090
One bullet should be

789
01:07:53,090 --> 01:07:56,539
used as a gunpowder.

790
01:07:56,539 --> 01:07:59,039
Two, gunpowder times two is

791
01:07:59,039 --> 01:08:01,039
handgun ammo. Gunpowder plus high grade gunpowder.

792
01:08:01,039 --> 01:08:03,039
So gunpowder plus yellow is shotgun.

793
01:08:03,039 --> 01:08:05,039
And then gunpowder plus

794
01:08:05,039 --> 01:08:07,039
two yellows is mag

795
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:12,739
ammo. There's not a lot of ammo left

796
01:08:12,739 --> 01:08:14,739
around the station to make you just spend a gunpowder you find.

797
01:08:14,739 --> 01:08:16,739
Different guns require different ammo.

798
01:08:16,739 --> 01:08:18,739
So pay attention when you're combining things or you won't get

799
01:08:18,739 --> 01:08:26,800
what you need. Gunpowder.

800
01:08:26,800 --> 01:08:37,659
Okay, I have to shoot this guy

801
01:08:37,659 --> 01:08:39,659
in the head. I gotta kill this guy I think.

802
01:08:39,659 --> 01:08:43,949
I have to shoot him. I have to kill him.

803
01:08:43,949 --> 01:08:50,029
God damn it, really?

804
01:08:50,029 --> 01:08:53,939
Okay, get me out.

805
01:08:53,939 --> 01:09:02,380
Before he gets up, he might get up.

806
01:09:02,380 --> 01:09:06,289
Alright, no more. Don't shoot anybody else.

807
01:09:06,289 --> 01:09:08,289
Let's see what we got. We got a spade key. We got

808
01:09:08,289 --> 01:09:10,289
something over here. That's a safe.

809
01:09:10,289 --> 01:09:13,680
What the hell?

810
01:09:13,680 --> 01:09:15,680
What the hell was that? What the fuck?

811
01:09:15,680 --> 01:09:18,819
What the fuck, man? Okay.

812
01:09:18,819 --> 01:09:22,140
Your mission is to unlock

813
01:09:22,140 --> 01:09:24,140
your desk. The key to your success

814
01:09:24,140 --> 01:09:26,140
is in the initials

815
01:09:26,140 --> 01:09:28,140
of our first names.

816
01:09:28,140 --> 01:09:30,449
Input the letters in order of our

817
01:09:30,449 --> 01:09:32,880
desks. There are two

818
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:34,880
locks, one on each side of your desk.

819
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:36,880
Make sure you get them both.

820
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:40,020
Basically, your first task is to remember

821
01:09:40,020 --> 01:09:42,020
your fellow officer's names, but you figured

822
01:09:42,020 --> 01:09:44,020
that much out, right? Good luck, Leon.

823
01:09:44,020 --> 01:09:46,020
By the way, it might take a little

824
01:09:46,020 --> 01:09:48,020
work to get Scott to give you a straight

825
01:09:48,020 --> 01:09:51,979
answer. Be glad you're not

826
01:09:51,979 --> 01:09:57,229
here, rookie.

827
01:09:57,229 --> 01:09:59,229
They're just fucking with me on my first

828
01:09:59,229 --> 01:10:02,109
day.

829
01:10:02,109 --> 01:10:04,109
In the initials of our first names,

830
01:10:04,109 --> 01:10:06,109
input the letters in order of our desks.

831
01:10:06,109 --> 01:10:09,119
So we got Scott.

832
01:10:09,119 --> 01:10:11,119
Right? What does it say? Scott?

833
01:10:11,119 --> 01:10:15,279
So, S.

834
01:10:15,279 --> 01:10:20,210
So who else? Who wrote this?

835
01:10:20,210 --> 01:10:26,159
S and B?

836
01:10:26,159 --> 01:10:28,529
S, B?

837
01:10:28,529 --> 01:10:39,279
Okay, well let's put it away.

838
01:10:39,279 --> 01:10:47,710
What? Hold on.

839
01:10:47,710 --> 01:10:49,710
The initials of our first names?

840
01:10:49,710 --> 01:10:58,220
Does this have an S?

841
01:10:58,220 --> 01:11:02,319
I'm going to have to look at everybody's

842
01:11:02,319 --> 01:11:10,699
name tags. Cops are

843
01:11:10,699 --> 01:11:12,699
known for their love of puzzles.

844
01:11:12,699 --> 01:11:16,979
Okay, so let me

845
01:11:16,979 --> 01:11:18,979
look at that one more time. Cause

846
01:11:18,979 --> 01:11:25,699
we gotta go look at the desks.

847
01:11:25,699 --> 01:11:28,260
Okay, this is David.

848
01:11:28,260 --> 01:11:30,260
David, David Ford.

849
01:11:30,260 --> 01:11:32,260
Alright, this guy's gotta die. Maybe not.

850
01:11:32,260 --> 01:11:35,710
Alright, we got M.

851
01:11:35,710 --> 01:11:38,460
Where are you coming from? I knew you were

852
01:11:38,460 --> 01:11:41,020
gonna get up. M?

853
01:11:41,020 --> 01:11:44,159
M? Oh

854
01:11:44,159 --> 01:11:48,510
God damn it.

855
01:11:48,510 --> 01:11:50,510
Okay, name tag.

856
01:11:50,510 --> 01:11:52,510
We got N.

857
01:11:52,510 --> 01:12:00,130
It's down to just me and three others.

858
01:12:00,130 --> 01:12:02,130
No weapons, no ammo, and too many skirmishes.

859
01:12:02,130 --> 01:12:04,130
Who are you? I don't care about any of this.

860
01:12:04,130 --> 01:12:06,130
E. So, N, E.

861
01:12:06,130 --> 01:12:08,939
N, E, D.

862
01:12:08,939 --> 01:12:15,090
It is this one. Ned.

863
01:12:15,090 --> 01:12:17,090
Okay.

864
01:12:17,090 --> 01:12:21,060
And then this one is

865
01:12:21,060 --> 01:12:24,500
M. I don't need to kill

866
01:12:24,500 --> 01:12:31,140
you.

867
01:12:31,140 --> 01:12:35,420
What is your name? What is your name?

868
01:12:35,420 --> 01:12:47,250
Cool.

869
01:12:47,250 --> 01:12:54,859
Give me the knife back.

870
01:12:54,859 --> 01:12:56,859
God. Give me the knife.

871
01:12:56,859 --> 01:13:03,119
It's almost broken.

872
01:13:03,119 --> 01:13:05,619
Okay, that was George.

873
01:13:05,619 --> 01:13:07,619
So that's G, R,

874
01:13:07,619 --> 01:13:10,819
M.

875
01:13:10,819 --> 01:13:17,020
George, George RR

876
01:13:17,020 --> 01:13:23,550
Martin.

877
01:13:23,550 --> 01:13:26,050
Open the desk. High capacity

878
01:13:26,050 --> 01:13:28,989
mag. And

879
01:13:28,989 --> 01:13:42,739
I have to take one of these.

880
01:13:42,739 --> 01:13:46,319
I gotta take one of those herbs.

881
01:13:46,319 --> 01:13:48,319
I have to. I hate that I have to do it.

882
01:13:48,319 --> 01:13:50,319
I hate it. I'm gonna

883
01:13:50,319 --> 01:13:54,479
No, but I can combine these.

884
01:13:54,479 --> 01:13:58,960
Just do it. Fuck it.

885
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:13,039
I'm not taking any heals.

886
01:14:13,039 --> 01:14:21,229
What did I do wrong?

887
01:14:21,229 --> 01:14:28,270
Isn't that for a machine gun?

888
01:14:28,270 --> 01:14:32,750
Alright, I'm getting out of here.

889
01:14:32,750 --> 01:14:37,869
Where the fuck am I gonna go now?

890
01:14:37,869 --> 01:14:40,500
Open this door. I can apparently.

891
01:14:40,500 --> 01:14:44,210
It's for the pistol?

892
01:14:44,210 --> 01:14:54,189
I saw the

893
01:14:54,189 --> 01:14:56,189
mag and I thought it was

894
01:14:56,189 --> 01:14:58,189
the gunpowder said that like

895
01:14:58,189 --> 01:15:00,189
pistol and then shotgun

896
01:15:00,189 --> 01:15:02,189
mag and I was like oh a mag for

897
01:15:02,189 --> 01:15:11,899
fuck me.

898
01:15:11,899 --> 01:15:13,899
I've only been on fucking Comcast. Not even

899
01:15:13,899 --> 01:15:17,340
that's the wrong company. Okay.

900
01:15:17,340 --> 01:15:19,340
It's alright though. I was gonna combine them anyways

901
01:15:19,340 --> 01:15:22,100
eventually. So I can hold 24

902
01:15:22,100 --> 01:15:26,189
rounds. Cool. Oh my god.

903
01:15:26,189 --> 01:15:28,189
Oh my fucking

904
01:15:28,189 --> 01:15:32,159
Jesus. The Olaf

905
01:15:32,159 --> 01:15:34,159
just gave 50 community subs.

906
01:15:34,159 --> 01:15:36,720
50. 50.

907
01:15:36,720 --> 01:15:42,739
50. Gifting a moron.

908
01:15:42,739 --> 01:15:46,510
I'm not a moron.

909
01:15:46,510 --> 01:15:49,899
It's very dark in here.

910
01:15:49,899 --> 01:15:51,899
Do you see how dark it is? You think you can read

911
01:15:51,899 --> 01:15:59,710
a screen when it's this dark? Thank you

912
01:15:59,710 --> 01:16:01,710
so much for the 50 community

913
01:16:01,710 --> 01:16:04,399
subs. That's a shit load.

914
01:16:04,399 --> 01:16:09,500
You are an idiot.

915
01:16:09,500 --> 01:16:11,500
I'm like juggling so much stuff right now.

916
01:16:11,500 --> 01:16:16,239
I'm juggling. I'm juggling with the fact

917
01:16:16,239 --> 01:16:18,239
not only do I have my plane this game. I got a dark room.

918
01:16:18,239 --> 01:16:21,569
I got an internet that's not working.

919
01:16:21,569 --> 01:16:23,569
I had diarrhea this morning. Still have it.

920
01:16:23,569 --> 01:16:25,569
It's coming up right now. I've been going

921
01:16:25,569 --> 01:16:27,569
like this to try to keep it quiet.

922
01:16:27,569 --> 01:16:39,340
Anyways. That's a huge amount of money. Thank you

923
01:16:39,340 --> 01:16:44,079
so much. 209

924
01:16:44,079 --> 01:16:46,079
109. I don't know what that means.

925
01:16:46,079 --> 01:16:49,090
I think it's mo-

926
01:16:49,090 --> 01:16:51,090
Thank you very much

927
01:16:51,090 --> 01:16:53,579
first try. Got it?

928
01:16:53,579 --> 01:16:55,579
Fucking Jesus man.

929
01:16:55,579 --> 01:16:57,579
This 23,000 drop frames.

930
01:16:57,579 --> 01:16:59,579
Should I even stop?

931
01:16:59,579 --> 01:17:01,579
Should I just stop and do something else

932
01:17:01,579 --> 01:17:03,579
because I don't want this to be like a lag

933
01:17:03,579 --> 01:17:12,670
dog shit stream.

934
01:17:12,670 --> 01:17:14,670
This is something I've been looking forward to doing for a long time.

935
01:17:14,670 --> 01:17:19,090
Alright. What do we got? We got

936
01:17:19,090 --> 01:17:21,090
prizes. Okay. This is 203.

937
01:17:21,090 --> 01:17:23,520
I think it's missing.

938
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:25,520
208 is shotgun.

939
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:28,020
That one's already open.

940
01:17:28,020 --> 01:17:31,199
109. 108.

941
01:17:31,199 --> 01:17:34,020
106. Where is he?

942
01:17:34,020 --> 01:17:36,020
103. 102.

943
01:17:36,020 --> 01:17:41,840
I swear to God. Is there another

944
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:48,050
guy over here?

945
01:17:48,050 --> 01:17:50,539
Let's do 108.

946
01:17:50,539 --> 01:17:58,859
107. Which

947
01:17:58,859 --> 01:18:00,859
is the one right there? 102.

948
01:18:00,859 --> 01:18:02,859
102 and 103. Oh there is no

949
01:18:02,859 --> 01:18:04,859
two. Okay. I need to find the two.

950
01:18:04,859 --> 01:18:10,619
Can any of these other ones be

951
01:18:10,619 --> 01:18:12,619
opened? 103? No. Two and three both gone.

952
01:18:12,619 --> 01:18:14,619
So now these can be

953
01:18:14,619 --> 01:18:16,619
opened until I get the

954
01:18:16,619 --> 01:18:18,619
number off of the keyboard

955
01:18:18,619 --> 01:18:20,619
or whatever the hell I have to do. What about this?

956
01:18:20,619 --> 01:18:22,619
This is a weapons locker. I need a key

957
01:18:22,619 --> 01:18:24,619
card. I don't have it.

958
01:18:24,619 --> 01:18:26,619
There's a shotgun in there.

959
01:18:26,619 --> 01:18:28,619
That's pretty amazing.

960
01:18:28,619 --> 01:18:31,760
I don't think I can do much in here right now so

961
01:18:31,760 --> 01:18:33,760
let's go back to...

962
01:18:33,760 --> 01:18:45,329
Let me...

963
01:18:45,329 --> 01:18:53,199
Give me one second.

964
01:18:53,199 --> 01:18:55,199
Let me go take a piss. Let me figure

965
01:18:55,199 --> 01:18:57,199
out what the hell I want to do about this because

966
01:18:57,199 --> 01:18:59,949
it has not gotten better and I really

967
01:18:59,949 --> 01:19:01,949
was going to give it like an hour or so. So we need to do

968
01:19:01,949 --> 01:19:03,949
something else I think. Unfortunately

969
01:19:03,949 --> 01:19:07,470
I'm sorry. Let me see

970
01:19:07,470 --> 01:19:09,899
what else we can do. I was like praying

971
01:19:09,899 --> 01:19:11,899
that this wasn't going to happen for this

972
01:19:11,899 --> 01:19:13,899
long but it has so. I'll be right back. We'll figure

973
01:19:13,899 --> 01:20:57,840
it out. Yeah it seems to have gotten

974
01:20:57,840 --> 01:20:59,840
worse since I just left.

975
01:20:59,840 --> 01:21:02,909
So I really don't know

976
01:21:02,909 --> 01:21:04,909
what to do about it. All I can do

977
01:21:04,909 --> 01:21:06,909
is continue to try to get

978
01:21:06,909 --> 01:21:09,279
every ISP I've ever had

979
01:21:09,279 --> 01:21:11,279
to fix their fucking internet.

980
01:21:11,279 --> 01:21:13,279
So it's

981
01:21:13,279 --> 01:21:18,850
stupid.

982
01:21:18,850 --> 01:21:28,260
So I do apologize. I'm sorry.

983
01:21:28,260 --> 01:21:30,260
I really was looking forward to doing Resident Evil 2

984
01:21:30,260 --> 01:21:32,500
tonight. I was planning

985
01:21:32,500 --> 01:21:36,590
on going for a long time.

986
01:21:36,590 --> 01:21:40,880
But I don't know. Kind of at the

987
01:21:40,880 --> 01:21:42,880
mercy of this

988
01:21:42,880 --> 01:21:44,880
shit. So I'm really sorry guys.

989
01:21:44,880 --> 01:21:50,319
I'm going to give it like another

990
01:21:50,319 --> 01:21:52,319
20 to 30 minutes.

991
01:21:52,319 --> 01:21:54,319
And if it's still doing it

992
01:21:54,319 --> 01:21:56,319
if we still have problems

993
01:21:56,319 --> 01:21:58,319
then we'll just go IRL and I'll just

994
01:21:58,319 --> 01:22:00,319
hang out. We'll just chill and maybe play like

995
01:22:00,319 --> 01:22:02,500
GeoGuessr or something.

996
01:22:02,500 --> 01:22:04,500
Or something else. Maybe we'll just hang out for a little while.

997
01:22:04,500 --> 01:22:06,500
We'll try again tomorrow.

998
01:22:06,500 --> 01:22:08,800
I'm

999
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:10,800
going to also get in touch with

1000
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:13,359
Cox as well. So let's see what

1001
01:22:13,359 --> 01:22:22,449
happens. So

1002
01:22:22,449 --> 01:22:26,220
so many subs came in too.

1003
01:22:26,220 --> 01:22:29,279
Thanks a lot guys.

1004
01:22:29,279 --> 01:22:31,279
Appreciate the patience.

1005
01:22:31,279 --> 01:22:33,649
So let me look what's over here.

1006
01:22:33,649 --> 01:22:35,649
Storage locker terminal memo.

1007
01:22:35,649 --> 01:22:38,140
It appears that the keypad to the

1008
01:22:38,140 --> 01:22:40,140
lockers terminal was missing a few keys. I suggested

1009
01:22:40,140 --> 01:22:42,140
the person responsible for this mess.

1010
01:22:42,140 --> 01:22:44,140
Find some spare keys and fix this

1011
01:22:44,140 --> 01:22:47,539
right now. Spare keys.

1012
01:22:47,539 --> 01:22:50,029
Interesting.

1013
01:22:50,029 --> 01:22:53,600
Spare keys. Wherever that would

1014
01:22:53,600 --> 01:23:02,539
be.

1015
01:23:02,539 --> 01:23:04,539
So locker terminal dark room.

1016
01:23:04,539 --> 01:23:06,539
How do I get to the dark room?

1017
01:23:06,539 --> 01:23:12,109
Jesus.

1018
01:23:12,109 --> 01:23:15,060
Somebody's going to come from the right side.

1019
01:23:15,060 --> 01:23:20,300
I just know it. What's this?

1020
01:23:20,300 --> 01:23:22,300
A heal.

1021
01:23:22,300 --> 01:23:27,739
I can take that. Let's open this.

1022
01:23:27,739 --> 01:23:29,739
Ooh what's that?

1023
01:23:29,739 --> 01:23:31,739
Wooden boards? Oh I thought there was a gun

1024
01:23:31,739 --> 01:23:34,880
taped to this.

1025
01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:41,020
Oh shit.

1026
01:23:41,020 --> 01:23:43,020
Is there a reason why that can be used to board up windows

1027
01:23:43,020 --> 01:23:45,020
keeping the rip-rap out?

1028
01:23:45,020 --> 01:23:49,819
Let's just eat the herb.

1029
01:23:49,819 --> 01:23:56,739
So should I board up this window?

1030
01:23:56,739 --> 01:24:01,470
I could board that window up.

1031
01:24:01,470 --> 01:24:04,930
I mean the board in that one. No.

1032
01:24:04,930 --> 01:24:21,310
I'm just going to save. Well he ain't getting it.

1033
01:24:21,310 --> 01:24:27,649
What is in here?

1034
01:24:27,649 --> 01:24:31,489
There's a save point right there.

1035
01:24:31,489 --> 01:24:35,520
Might as well do it.

1036
01:24:35,520 --> 01:24:39,659
It was that simple.

1037
01:24:39,659 --> 01:24:42,609
We saved.

1038
01:24:42,609 --> 01:24:44,609
Medicinal benefits of herbs.

1039
01:24:44,609 --> 01:24:46,609
Humans have used herbs to treat sickness and disease since the dawn

1040
01:24:46,609 --> 01:24:48,609
of time. In this book, we will

1041
01:24:48,609 --> 01:24:52,260
explore. No that's a plane.

1042
01:24:52,260 --> 01:24:54,260
That's just a plane.

1043
01:24:54,260 --> 01:24:56,500
I don't know why I thought that was like a bee or a

1044
01:24:56,500 --> 01:24:58,739
dog enemy in the game or something.

1045
01:24:58,739 --> 01:25:00,739
Green herbs have the ability to

1046
01:25:00,739 --> 01:25:02,739
heal basic injuries while blue herbs have

1047
01:25:02,739 --> 01:25:04,739
been used to treat poisoning.

1048
01:25:04,739 --> 01:25:06,739
As for red, they're very visually

1049
01:25:06,739 --> 01:25:08,739
appealing. They offer no

1050
01:25:08,739 --> 01:25:10,739
medicinal benefits or so it was thought

1051
01:25:10,739 --> 01:25:13,100
until recently.

1052
01:25:13,100 --> 01:25:15,789
It's well known that combining herbs

1053
01:25:15,789 --> 01:25:17,789
produces blends that heighten the herb's effects

1054
01:25:17,789 --> 01:25:19,789
but it's been discovered that red herbs can play a big

1055
01:25:19,789 --> 01:25:21,789
role when mixed properly.

1056
01:25:21,789 --> 01:25:23,789
Blue and red

1057
01:25:23,789 --> 01:25:25,789
produces a blend that will strengthen one's constitution.

1058
01:25:25,789 --> 01:25:28,989
Truly, we have just begun to realize

1059
01:25:28,989 --> 01:25:30,989
the full potential of these herbs and their ability to

1060
01:25:30,989 --> 01:25:32,989
heal the human body. Further research is sure to

1061
01:25:32,989 --> 01:25:34,989
yield even more fascinating results.

1062
01:25:34,989 --> 01:25:36,989
Red and blue is constitution.

1063
01:25:36,989 --> 01:25:41,779
Very cool.

1064
01:25:41,779 --> 01:25:43,779
And then you can do a triple herb, right?

1065
01:25:43,779 --> 01:25:50,989
Okay.

1066
01:25:50,989 --> 01:25:54,380
Well there's the gunpowder.

1067
01:25:54,380 --> 01:25:56,380
So do I hold on to...

1068
01:25:56,380 --> 01:25:58,380
I have such trouble playing these games

1069
01:25:58,380 --> 01:26:03,180
because I always want to hold on to everything.

1070
01:26:03,180 --> 01:26:10,220
In fact, I'm going to.

1071
01:26:10,220 --> 01:26:12,220
I'm going to store the herb.

1072
01:26:12,220 --> 01:26:14,590
No, I'm not. Store a heal.

1073
01:26:14,590 --> 01:26:18,239
Should have kept the damn key.

1074
01:26:18,239 --> 01:26:25,659
Alright, save it one more time.

1075
01:26:25,659 --> 01:26:35,710
Yeah, the red check mark. So wait, you got...

1076
01:26:35,710 --> 01:26:38,399
Yeah, everyone was...

1077
01:26:38,399 --> 01:26:40,399
Everybody was telling me that I could have used that key.

1078
01:26:40,399 --> 01:26:42,399
No, I couldn't have, but it has a red check mark on it.

1079
01:26:42,399 --> 01:26:48,340
See?

1080
01:26:48,340 --> 01:26:51,279
You can just discard it.

1081
01:26:51,279 --> 01:26:58,770
Okay. How do I discard it from...

1082
01:26:58,770 --> 01:27:04,850
Do I have to do it from here?

1083
01:27:04,850 --> 01:27:12,529
I'm not getting fucked with, right?

1084
01:27:12,529 --> 01:27:16,880
Okay, cool. Anything else in here that I need to do?

1085
01:27:16,880 --> 01:27:18,880
This is... This game's fucking good.

1086
01:27:18,880 --> 01:27:21,890
That it is...

1087
01:27:21,890 --> 01:27:25,920
It just is. Okay.

1088
01:27:25,920 --> 01:27:29,380
So we got some... I need a photo.

1089
01:27:29,380 --> 01:27:35,569
Photo.

1090
01:27:35,569 --> 01:27:37,569
We got some... Oh, this is a red herb.

1091
01:27:37,569 --> 01:27:40,189
Shit.

1092
01:27:40,189 --> 01:27:42,369
Okay.

1093
01:27:42,369 --> 01:27:44,369
Film contains evidence. Do not leave out.

1094
01:27:44,369 --> 01:27:49,039
Okay.

1095
01:27:49,039 --> 01:27:51,039
So I need a photo to put in here.

1096
01:27:51,039 --> 01:27:56,159
And wash it so I can see what it looks like.

1097
01:27:56,159 --> 01:27:59,869
I'm going to store that herb.

1098
01:27:59,869 --> 01:28:01,869
Guarantee you. I bet you a thousand dollars.

1099
01:28:01,869 --> 01:28:03,869
That. An hour, two, three hours

1100
01:28:03,869 --> 01:28:05,869
into this playthrough, that box is going to be full of shit

1101
01:28:05,869 --> 01:28:07,869
that I haven't used yet.

1102
01:28:07,869 --> 01:28:10,109
And I'm going to be like, no, no, no. I need that for later.

1103
01:28:10,109 --> 01:28:12,109
I'm going to need that for later.

1104
01:28:12,109 --> 01:28:14,109
Later's going to come on. Dude, are you going to combine the red herbs and the blue herbs?

1105
01:28:14,109 --> 01:28:16,109
No, no. I might need them.

1106
01:28:16,109 --> 01:28:18,109
I think I'm going to need them later.

1107
01:28:18,109 --> 01:28:20,109
They're going to see the credits.

1108
01:28:20,109 --> 01:28:22,109
The credits are going to roll.

1109
01:28:22,109 --> 01:28:24,109
And you're going to say, dude, you never used

1110
01:28:24,109 --> 01:28:26,109
those blue and red herbs.

1111
01:28:26,109 --> 01:28:28,109
Yeah, but I knew game plus, man. It's going to be important when I need those.

1112
01:28:28,109 --> 01:28:34,189
I'll never use them.

1113
01:28:34,189 --> 01:28:36,189
So let's take a look at the map.

1114
01:28:36,189 --> 01:28:40,670
Item box, dark room, sink.

1115
01:28:40,670 --> 01:28:42,670
All right. There's so much to explore.

1116
01:28:42,670 --> 01:28:45,420
I can't go into

1117
01:28:45,420 --> 01:28:47,420
these rooms yet.

1118
01:28:47,420 --> 01:28:49,729
So we're going to have to take a...

1119
01:28:49,729 --> 01:28:51,729
Let's see. Where do I go from here?

1120
01:28:51,729 --> 01:28:53,729
Fuse box, entrance. How the fuck?

1121
01:28:53,729 --> 01:28:55,729
Upstairs, maybe?

1122
01:28:55,729 --> 01:28:59,949
Because they're going to bang a left and then maybe...

1123
01:28:59,949 --> 01:29:01,949
Oh, up the stairs. There's a stair.

1124
01:29:01,949 --> 01:29:08,220
I remember these stairs from the

1125
01:29:08,220 --> 01:29:27,810
original game. He can't open

1126
01:29:27,810 --> 01:29:30,560
the door, right? Gas. Dion.

1127
01:29:30,560 --> 01:29:39,180
Nothing. Shotgun shells.

1128
01:29:39,180 --> 01:29:41,180
Store room.

1129
01:29:41,180 --> 01:29:48,020
Portable safe.

1130
01:29:48,020 --> 01:29:50,020
A small portable safe. What the fuck am I going to do with that?

1131
01:29:50,020 --> 01:29:52,189
Portable safe instructions.

1132
01:29:52,189 --> 01:29:55,779
Press a button to

1133
01:29:55,779 --> 01:29:57,779
light up its corresponding lamp.

1134
01:29:57,779 --> 01:29:59,779
Yes, I'm like itching my ear. Sometimes when I have to think hard,

1135
01:29:59,779 --> 01:30:01,779
I go like this and itch in my

1136
01:30:01,779 --> 01:30:03,779
ear. Press a button to light up its

1137
01:30:03,779 --> 01:30:05,779
corresponding lamp. Then light them

1138
01:30:05,779 --> 01:30:07,779
all to open the safe.

1139
01:30:07,779 --> 01:30:09,779
The buttons must be pressed in a certain order. Pressing a single

1140
01:30:09,779 --> 01:30:11,779
button out of order will cause all

1141
01:30:11,779 --> 01:30:13,779
the lights to go out and you will need to start the

1142
01:30:13,779 --> 01:30:15,779
sequence over again.

1143
01:30:15,779 --> 01:30:20,619
Okay.

1144
01:30:20,619 --> 01:30:26,319
Press them in an order.

1145
01:30:26,319 --> 01:30:28,319
Examining items from different angles.

1146
01:30:28,319 --> 01:30:31,779
You can examine and spin it around.

1147
01:30:31,779 --> 01:30:34,590
Okay. So.

1148
01:30:34,590 --> 01:30:51,359
Let's go. Certain order.

1149
01:30:51,359 --> 01:30:53,359
Okay, okay, okay. Top right, bottom right.

1150
01:30:53,359 --> 01:31:02,300
Top right, top right, bottom right,

1151
01:31:02,300 --> 01:31:06,460
top left.

1152
01:31:06,460 --> 01:31:33,260
Yeah!

1153
01:31:33,260 --> 01:31:37,300
Ooh. Spare key.

1154
01:31:37,300 --> 01:31:40,939
What number is it? One?

1155
01:31:40,939 --> 01:31:47,470
Oh, it doesn't matter what it is. Okay.

1156
01:31:47,470 --> 01:31:49,470
One way to turn off that gas, right?

1157
01:31:49,470 --> 01:31:52,859
D.

1158
01:31:52,859 --> 01:31:55,039
D, D, D, D, D, D!

1159
01:31:55,039 --> 01:31:57,039
No, that was, I didn't even need to do that.

1160
01:31:57,039 --> 01:32:00,880
Shit. It's all right.

1161
01:32:00,880 --> 01:32:05,100
Oh.

1162
01:32:05,100 --> 01:32:07,100
I just shot for no reason. Okay.

1163
01:32:07,100 --> 01:32:09,859
Turn the gas off.

1164
01:32:09,859 --> 01:32:11,859
I don't have anything to do that with, but I do have the key

1165
01:32:11,859 --> 01:32:13,859
now. I can probably get something.

1166
01:32:13,859 --> 01:32:15,859
Let me go store. No.

1167
01:32:15,859 --> 01:32:20,659
No, don't even walk through it. You can't.

1168
01:32:20,659 --> 01:32:23,409
Let's go back to

1169
01:32:23,409 --> 01:32:25,409
the main room.

1170
01:32:25,409 --> 01:32:27,710
Ooh, what's this? Handgun ammo?

1171
01:32:27,710 --> 01:32:31,229
Really?

1172
01:32:31,229 --> 01:32:39,489
Come on. Don't like

1173
01:32:39,489 --> 01:32:41,489
bait me here. Just cut, just,

1174
01:32:41,489 --> 01:32:49,939
just get in here. I don't need to fight

1175
01:32:49,939 --> 01:32:51,939
this guy. I don't need to fight anybody.

1176
01:32:51,939 --> 01:32:56,029
Oh my god. Another fifty dollars just

1177
01:32:56,029 --> 01:32:58,529
came in. Let me go back to the

1178
01:32:58,529 --> 01:33:00,770
fifty dollars

1179
01:33:00,770 --> 01:33:05,229
from, from

1180
01:33:05,229 --> 01:33:07,409
Apocalyptic Cheeseburger.

1181
01:33:07,409 --> 01:33:10,539
Thank you so much for fifty bucks.

1182
01:33:10,539 --> 01:33:12,779
Uh, going off my last

1183
01:33:12,779 --> 01:33:14,779
update. My friend says he's getting more calls,

1184
01:33:14,779 --> 01:33:16,779
but they're already calling back telling him that they're

1185
01:33:16,779 --> 01:33:18,779
fixed. He was also hoping to play

1186
01:33:18,779 --> 01:33:20,779
Resident Evil 2, uh,

1187
01:33:20,779 --> 01:33:22,779
the remake tonight. And apologies to you

1188
01:33:22,779 --> 01:33:24,779
for working with people who don't know what

1189
01:33:24,779 --> 01:33:27,090
they're working with. Love you,

1190
01:33:27,090 --> 01:33:30,420
man. Thank you for the fifty

1191
01:33:30,420 --> 01:33:33,489
dollars. Thank you so much. It's a lot

1192
01:33:33,489 --> 01:33:35,489
of money. It's so much

1193
01:33:35,489 --> 01:33:37,489
money. You guys have given so much.

1194
01:33:37,489 --> 01:33:39,489
But, no, and the thing with

1195
01:33:39,489 --> 01:33:41,979
uh, Cox is fixed.

1196
01:33:41,979 --> 01:33:43,979
Yeah, but like it should, I shouldn't have to

1197
01:33:43,979 --> 01:33:45,979
be like this. It

1198
01:33:45,979 --> 01:33:48,930
shouldn't be like this. It shouldn't be

1199
01:33:48,930 --> 01:33:50,930
seriously like every other stream be throwing dice

1200
01:33:50,930 --> 01:33:52,930
in the air to see if I'm gonna be able to turn a stream on.

1201
01:33:52,930 --> 01:33:54,930
You know what I mean? I think it just shouldn't be like that.

1202
01:33:54,930 --> 01:33:56,930
And now I, I mentioned it by name

1203
01:33:56,930 --> 01:34:01,659
and I just dropped a frame. Turn the

1204
01:34:01,659 --> 01:34:03,659
lights on in my room. Oh, here.

1205
01:34:03,659 --> 01:34:08,210
It is getting too dark now.

1206
01:34:08,210 --> 01:34:17,229
There, see? That's like

1207
01:34:17,229 --> 01:34:21,390
fine. That's like still okay.

1208
01:34:21,390 --> 01:34:25,489
It doesn't have to be like this.

1209
01:34:25,489 --> 01:34:30,670
No, it really doesn't. It's

1210
01:34:30,670 --> 01:34:32,850
just companies

1211
01:34:32,850 --> 01:34:34,850
loading on as

1212
01:34:34,850 --> 01:34:36,850
many subscriptions as they can.

1213
01:34:36,850 --> 01:34:38,850
And not caring about anything

1214
01:34:38,850 --> 01:34:40,850
but a bottom line. When you

1215
01:34:40,850 --> 01:34:42,850
just dump as many

1216
01:34:42,850 --> 01:34:44,850
possible customers as you possibly

1217
01:34:44,850 --> 01:34:46,850
can, you don't, it doesn't matter.

1218
01:34:46,850 --> 01:34:49,409
Now we need to go to the dark room.

1219
01:34:49,409 --> 01:34:51,409
No, no, no, no, no. The uh, safety deposit room.

1220
01:34:51,409 --> 01:34:58,560
Uh, so I got a new key.

1221
01:34:58,560 --> 01:35:00,560
Let me.

1222
01:35:00,560 --> 01:35:02,560
Fucking God, I forgot this guy. You know, I'm

1223
01:35:02,560 --> 01:35:04,560
using some bullets. I can.

1224
01:35:04,560 --> 01:35:13,390
Like, I'm gonna use a couple of bullets here. I don't wanna

1225
01:35:13,390 --> 01:35:17,149
deal with this guy anymore. Okay.

1226
01:35:17,149 --> 01:35:19,149
So I have a spare key.

1227
01:35:19,149 --> 01:35:21,329
I could do 202, which looks

1228
01:35:21,329 --> 01:35:23,569
like some kind of fanny pack.

1229
01:35:23,569 --> 01:35:25,569
208,

1230
01:35:25,569 --> 01:35:27,569
which is shotgun bullets.

1231
01:35:27,569 --> 01:35:30,130
And then I need a key card for this.

1232
01:35:30,130 --> 01:35:32,130
So, should I do fanny pack or what's the

1233
01:35:32,130 --> 01:35:34,689
109, 106?

1234
01:35:34,689 --> 01:35:36,689
Uh, so something I didn't do.

1235
01:35:36,689 --> 01:35:39,439
Okay, we'll get that.

1236
01:35:39,439 --> 01:35:41,439
102, 103 is another knife.

1237
01:35:41,439 --> 01:35:43,439
No, we didn't do two.

1238
01:35:43,439 --> 01:35:46,130
How can you still be alive

1239
01:35:46,130 --> 01:35:48,300
after that? No way.

1240
01:35:48,300 --> 01:35:54,189
Just stay down.

1241
01:35:54,189 --> 01:35:59,250
Holy shit. Okay.

1242
01:35:59,250 --> 01:36:02,640
Put on, put it on two.

1243
01:36:02,640 --> 01:36:07,550
Uh, on two.

1244
01:36:07,550 --> 01:36:09,550
And then we need to do 20,

1245
01:36:09,550 --> 01:36:11,550
203. Oh fuck,

1246
01:36:11,550 --> 01:36:13,550
I can't open that. 20,

1247
01:36:13,550 --> 01:36:24,479
208.

1248
01:36:24,479 --> 01:36:29,340
208, 106.

1249
01:36:29,340 --> 01:36:33,250
106. Except that looks like a battery.

1250
01:36:33,250 --> 01:36:36,260
And then I think,

1251
01:36:36,260 --> 01:36:38,260
I don't know what the other ones are.

1252
01:36:38,260 --> 01:36:40,260
Let's just get these.

1253
01:36:40,260 --> 01:36:42,260
208, open it up.

1254
01:36:42,260 --> 01:36:45,520
More shotgun ammo, good.

1255
01:36:45,520 --> 01:36:49,420
And then 206,

1256
01:36:49,420 --> 01:36:51,420
which is, what the hell is this?

1257
01:36:51,420 --> 01:36:53,420
Ooh.

1258
01:36:53,420 --> 01:36:58,460
It's a roll of film.

1259
01:36:58,460 --> 01:37:03,649
Back to the dark room.

1260
01:37:03,649 --> 01:37:05,649
Can I open this one? 103, no.

1261
01:37:05,649 --> 01:37:07,649
102 can be opened. Let's get it.

1262
01:37:07,649 --> 01:37:17,630
Which is gunpowder.

1263
01:37:17,630 --> 01:37:21,279
Alright, back to the dark room.

1264
01:37:21,279 --> 01:37:23,899
And the storage box, I'm gonna burp.

1265
01:37:23,899 --> 01:37:27,279
Okay.

1266
01:37:27,279 --> 01:37:29,520
Uh, so, wrap around

1267
01:37:29,520 --> 01:37:31,520
the left.

1268
01:37:31,520 --> 01:37:41,859
Right. Okay.

1269
01:37:41,859 --> 01:37:43,859
Dark room, and the storage box, good.

1270
01:37:43,859 --> 01:37:46,539
Bah, bah, bah.

1271
01:37:46,539 --> 01:37:48,539
What happened? What happened?

1272
01:37:48,539 --> 01:37:54,880
Why is everybody saying bah?

1273
01:37:54,880 --> 01:37:56,880
Got three gunpowders, gonna hold on

1274
01:37:56,880 --> 01:37:58,880
to them. Store the shotgun shells

1275
01:37:58,880 --> 01:38:00,880
because I don't have a shotgun yet, and maybe eventually

1276
01:38:00,880 --> 01:38:02,880
I will, but not right now.

1277
01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:06,140
And then we get the film. Bunch of sheep.

1278
01:38:06,140 --> 01:38:08,140
Bah, bah, bah.

1279
01:38:08,140 --> 01:38:15,250
Film canister, let's give it a try.

1280
01:38:15,250 --> 01:38:19,090
Use.

1281
01:38:19,090 --> 01:38:21,090
Okay, it's a king. Commemorative photo.

1282
01:38:21,090 --> 01:38:30,100
I don't get it. Is the king

1283
01:38:30,100 --> 01:38:35,340
with a book in his hand?

1284
01:38:35,340 --> 01:38:37,340
Move the camera so we can see the bullets. Oh, that's a good idea.

1285
01:38:37,340 --> 01:38:39,899
You're right. You are absolutely

1286
01:38:39,899 --> 01:38:51,729
right. See, there we go.

1287
01:38:51,729 --> 01:38:56,140
Okay, uh.

1288
01:38:56,140 --> 01:38:58,140
Back up, back up, back up, back up.

1289
01:38:58,140 --> 01:39:03,069
Uh, that looks okay. Alright.

1290
01:39:03,069 --> 01:39:07,229
So, uh, I got

1291
01:39:07,229 --> 01:39:09,229
a picture of the king.

1292
01:39:09,229 --> 01:39:14,220
Whatever that means. Let me look at

1293
01:39:14,220 --> 01:39:18,449
that again. So, it's

1294
01:39:18,449 --> 01:39:20,449
a picture of a king with a crown

1295
01:39:20,449 --> 01:39:22,449
and a scepter and a book.

1296
01:39:22,449 --> 01:39:27,060
I can't move it around. I can't flip it.

1297
01:39:27,060 --> 01:39:31,409
That's just what it looks like. Alright.

1298
01:39:31,409 --> 01:39:33,409
Oh, that's good to know. Where was

1299
01:39:33,409 --> 01:39:35,899
that? Was there a

1300
01:39:35,899 --> 01:39:37,899
guy with a book that I

1301
01:39:37,899 --> 01:39:42,510
missed? Not the statue.

1302
01:39:42,510 --> 01:39:45,069
It's the Burger King.

1303
01:39:45,069 --> 01:39:49,359
The Burger King.

1304
01:39:49,359 --> 01:39:51,920
Alright, so it looks like

1305
01:39:51,920 --> 01:39:53,920
there's some windows down here. Operations room

1306
01:39:53,920 --> 01:39:55,920
maybe, but I can't go through there.

1307
01:39:55,920 --> 01:39:59,380
Now I can't see health. Re.

1308
01:39:59,380 --> 01:40:03,710
Uh,

1309
01:40:03,710 --> 01:40:12,989
I don't know if there's anywhere I can go.

1310
01:40:12,989 --> 01:40:14,989
Let me go back.

1311
01:40:14,989 --> 01:40:17,680
Uh, any new keys or anything?

1312
01:40:17,680 --> 01:40:22,159
Let me see. Maybe back upstairs?

1313
01:40:22,159 --> 01:40:24,960
Just keep your face

1314
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:26,960
always over Leon's.

1315
01:40:26,960 --> 01:40:29,329
No, no, no, no, no.

1316
01:40:29,329 --> 01:40:33,489
That's not right. There's a safe

1317
01:40:33,489 --> 01:40:35,489
in there. There's a couple of saves.

1318
01:40:35,489 --> 01:40:38,300
Fuse box. I don't have a fuse box. Maybe

1319
01:40:38,300 --> 01:40:40,300
up here, no. Bathroom?

1320
01:40:40,300 --> 01:40:42,739
Break room? Watchman's

1321
01:40:42,739 --> 01:40:44,739
room, maybe? This is

1322
01:40:44,739 --> 01:40:47,810
maybe over here.

1323
01:40:47,810 --> 01:40:51,390
Put the cam in the corner.

1324
01:40:51,390 --> 01:40:56,579
Oh, we have...

1325
01:40:56,579 --> 01:40:58,579
...

1326
01:40:58,579 --> 01:41:00,579
Oh, olive oil!

1327
01:41:00,579 --> 01:41:05,819
...

1328
01:41:05,819 --> 01:41:12,670
Handgun bullets. Nobody knows what that is.

1329
01:41:12,670 --> 01:41:15,420
I'm just too old.

1330
01:41:15,420 --> 01:41:17,979
That's Popeye the Sailor Man.

1331
01:41:17,979 --> 01:41:19,979
That's just showing my age. I really am getting too

1332
01:41:19,979 --> 01:41:26,000
old, I think.

1333
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:39,500
I don't know what the fuck that is.

1334
01:41:39,500 --> 01:41:42,380
Ooh! The key, the spade key.

1335
01:41:42,380 --> 01:41:49,039
Now we have so many more doors to open.

1336
01:41:49,039 --> 01:41:52,050
Nothing I can do with the, uh,

1337
01:41:52,050 --> 01:42:00,619
mannequin thing? Okay. What's this?

1338
01:42:00,619 --> 01:42:02,619
Dial lock? I can't do anything about it.

1339
01:42:02,619 --> 01:42:04,859
I need to find a map of this area.

1340
01:42:07,420 --> 01:42:19,180
What in the...

1341
01:42:19,180 --> 01:42:31,090
Persephire Lung? No.

1342
01:42:31,090 --> 01:42:33,090
To any survivors, consider this a gift

1343
01:42:33,090 --> 01:42:35,090
to anyone still unfortunate enough to be alive.

1344
01:42:35,090 --> 01:42:37,090
Keep your eyes peeled for those

1345
01:42:37,090 --> 01:42:39,090
creepy fucks that look like they

1346
01:42:39,090 --> 01:42:41,090
were skinned alive. Liquors, we call

1347
01:42:41,090 --> 01:42:43,090
them. They're blind as bats, but they're hearing

1348
01:42:43,090 --> 01:42:45,090
more than makes up for that. I forgot about the other

1349
01:42:45,090 --> 01:42:47,090
enemies in this game. There are, like, spiders.

1350
01:42:47,090 --> 01:42:49,090
There are liquors. There are...

1351
01:42:49,090 --> 01:42:51,260
So as long as you don't run around like a total idiot

1352
01:42:51,260 --> 01:42:53,260
guns blazing, you should be able to slip right by

1353
01:42:53,260 --> 01:42:55,260
them, probably. Either way, make

1354
01:42:55,260 --> 01:42:57,260
like my grandma and creep around

1355
01:42:57,260 --> 01:42:59,260
as slow as possible.

1356
01:42:59,260 --> 01:43:01,260
Anyway, not that I want to go, but duty calls

1357
01:43:01,260 --> 01:43:03,260
that, and I got a friend to avenge. David.

1358
01:43:03,260 --> 01:43:08,060
I gotta be quiet

1359
01:43:08,060 --> 01:43:10,060
and they're blind.

1360
01:43:10,060 --> 01:43:13,260
Now I'm gonna turn around, there's gonna be one behind

1361
01:43:13,260 --> 01:43:16,529
me. What's the sneak

1362
01:43:16,529 --> 01:43:19,020
button? There is no sneak button.

1363
01:43:19,020 --> 01:43:40,850
Yes, I apologize for the E3

1364
01:43:40,850 --> 01:43:42,850
demo, but I just got the

1365
01:43:42,850 --> 01:43:44,850
word that they're here, so...

1366
01:43:44,850 --> 01:44:26,000
I need you back here ASAP. Are you okay,

1367
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,000
Martin? Back to the main hall?

1368
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:30,000
I've got something to show you. It's important.

1369
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:32,000
Copy that. I'll be right there. I like like a dirty

1370
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,000
version of the original Leon.

1371
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:41,539
Hey, thanks. Can I do

1372
01:44:41,539 --> 01:44:44,739
a Dark Souls free jump?

1373
01:44:44,739 --> 01:44:47,810
I guess not. Alright.

1374
01:44:47,810 --> 01:44:49,810
So much to look at. So much to explore.

1375
01:44:49,810 --> 01:44:54,670
Alright, so far I'm gonna give my first

1376
01:44:54,670 --> 01:44:57,039
impressions.

1377
01:44:57,039 --> 01:44:59,039
Kind of bad game.

1378
01:44:59,039 --> 01:45:05,500
I was gonna make...

1379
01:45:05,500 --> 01:45:07,500
It's a great game. Never mind.

1380
01:45:07,500 --> 01:45:09,500
Never mind. I go back

1381
01:45:09,500 --> 01:45:11,500
on everything I just said.

1382
01:45:11,500 --> 01:45:15,859
Where am I? The library? What's this?

1383
01:45:15,859 --> 01:45:17,859
There's a jack.

1384
01:45:17,859 --> 01:45:34,739
Red book! Hold on, I...

1385
01:45:34,739 --> 01:45:37,489
So at some point I gotta start fighting.

1386
01:45:37,489 --> 01:45:39,489
You know what I mean? This can't just be like a passive

1387
01:45:39,489 --> 01:45:41,489
playthrough.

1388
01:45:41,489 --> 01:45:51,779
Is he ever gonna not land a headshot?

1389
01:45:51,779 --> 01:46:09,949
What do you think, guys?

1390
01:46:09,949 --> 01:46:11,949
I mean, headshots only we're talking about. Okay,

1391
01:46:11,949 --> 01:46:18,979
jack this up. Fuck.

1392
01:46:18,979 --> 01:46:20,979
Where can I go with this? Over? Left? Right?

1393
01:46:20,979 --> 01:46:30,260
Can I not say I can move this one? Why can I not move

1394
01:46:30,260 --> 01:46:32,500
the other one?

1395
01:46:32,500 --> 01:46:36,210
Hey!

1396
01:46:36,210 --> 01:46:39,149
What do you do?

1397
01:46:39,149 --> 01:46:41,149
Only headshots we're talking about, guys.

1398
01:46:41,149 --> 01:46:44,420
I'm sorry.

1399
01:46:44,420 --> 01:46:46,420
So this shit in the way. I can't do it. I gotta jack that

1400
01:46:46,420 --> 01:46:52,880
up first. Okay.

1401
01:46:52,880 --> 01:46:56,020
I need that book! What can I do

1402
01:46:56,020 --> 01:47:02,739
here? The boards? The window

1403
01:47:02,739 --> 01:47:07,729
boards? Just get rid of them?

1404
01:47:07,729 --> 01:47:09,970
Maybe I can just get rid of the boards.

1405
01:47:09,970 --> 01:47:11,970
I could come back. Yeah, come back for it.

1406
01:47:11,970 --> 01:47:13,970
I got the key right. Yeah, that's right. That's right.

1407
01:47:13,970 --> 01:47:15,970
You got the right. I think it's fine.

1408
01:47:15,970 --> 01:47:17,970
The door's right here.

1409
01:47:17,970 --> 01:47:25,329
Back to the main hall.

1410
01:47:25,329 --> 01:47:27,329
That's so cool.

1411
01:47:27,329 --> 01:47:29,329
Just one giant puzzle.

1412
01:47:29,329 --> 01:47:36,939
I got the storage boxes right here.

1413
01:47:42,720 --> 01:47:46,880
Who is that?

1414
01:47:49,310 --> 01:47:51,310
I have no idea who that is.

1415
01:47:53,680 --> 01:47:55,680
Claire?

1416
01:47:55,680 --> 01:47:57,680
Claire.

1417
01:47:57,680 --> 01:47:59,680
I don't know. It doesn't ring a bell.

1418
01:48:04,859 --> 01:48:08,960
Dude, make a new meme

1419
01:48:08,960 --> 01:48:10,960
or riot. That's not how it works.

1420
01:48:10,960 --> 01:48:12,960
You don't just create a

1421
01:48:12,960 --> 01:48:14,960
meme because you feel like having a new meme.

1422
01:48:14,960 --> 01:48:16,960
That's not how it works.

1423
01:48:16,960 --> 01:48:18,960
That would not be a true new meme.

1424
01:48:18,960 --> 01:48:22,100
It wouldn't at all.

1425
01:48:22,100 --> 01:48:25,020
Alright. Gunpowder.

1426
01:48:25,020 --> 01:48:27,020
Keep the key.

1427
01:48:27,020 --> 01:48:29,020
Keep a couple of heals.

1428
01:48:29,020 --> 01:48:31,020
The boards. I mean

1429
01:48:31,020 --> 01:48:33,199
I don't

1430
01:48:33,199 --> 01:48:35,199
For now, I guess I don't know what to do with them.

1431
01:48:35,199 --> 01:48:39,420
Make a new meme or I'm unsubbing.

1432
01:48:39,420 --> 01:48:43,199
Nobody is ever required

1433
01:48:43,199 --> 01:48:45,199
to be subscribed to the channel.

1434
01:48:45,199 --> 01:48:47,500
I'm sorry. If you don't deem this channel

1435
01:48:47,500 --> 01:48:49,500
necessary to subscribe to and pay for

1436
01:48:49,500 --> 01:48:51,500
that's on you.

1437
01:48:51,500 --> 01:48:53,500
I can't tell you otherwise.

1438
01:48:53,500 --> 01:48:55,500
But if you're looking for a fresh new meme in

1439
01:48:55,500 --> 01:48:57,500
2019, you're going to miss it if you unsubscribe.

1440
01:48:57,500 --> 01:49:00,380
Okay. Let's go back here and get the book.

1441
01:49:00,380 --> 01:49:05,630
Claire's alive.

1442
01:49:05,630 --> 01:49:07,630
That's good to know.

1443
01:49:07,630 --> 01:49:12,289
Give me the book.

1444
01:49:12,289 --> 01:49:14,850
Streamer doesn't care about his fans.

1445
01:49:14,850 --> 01:49:20,289
Wait, this is the wrong, wait, wrong.

1446
01:49:20,289 --> 01:49:23,810
But also

1447
01:49:23,810 --> 01:49:29,439
different. This is the offices.

1448
01:49:29,439 --> 01:49:33,149
I don't know the safe combination.

1449
01:49:33,149 --> 01:49:36,100
So

1450
01:49:36,100 --> 01:49:38,100
anything else in here? Yeah, this is the safe

1451
01:49:38,100 --> 01:49:40,100
spring. Okay, yeah.

1452
01:49:40,100 --> 01:49:44,260
This is just a quicker way to get through here.

1453
01:49:44,260 --> 01:49:46,260
My meme stocks are dropping.

1454
01:49:46,260 --> 01:49:48,260
No, they're not. They're doing just fine.

1455
01:49:48,260 --> 01:49:50,260
Look,

1456
01:49:50,260 --> 01:49:52,260
it's alright. We're supposed to go through

1457
01:49:52,260 --> 01:49:54,939
a meme correction.

1458
01:49:54,939 --> 01:49:56,939
Our memes went parabolic in 2018.

1459
01:49:56,939 --> 01:50:01,810
There needs to be a correction.

1460
01:50:01,810 --> 01:50:09,619
Okay, so this is the book.

1461
01:50:09,619 --> 01:50:12,500
So who?

1462
01:50:12,500 --> 01:50:14,500
Who needs this book?

1463
01:50:14,500 --> 01:50:16,500
Is somebody in the main hall? Let me go look.

1464
01:50:16,500 --> 01:50:25,180
A handgun ammo

1465
01:50:25,180 --> 01:50:27,420
is in there somewhere.

1466
01:50:27,420 --> 01:50:29,420
Alright, waiting room, safe.

1467
01:50:29,420 --> 01:50:31,420
And then here's a spade door

1468
01:50:31,420 --> 01:50:33,420
on the other side of the waiting room. Let's go look at it.

1469
01:50:33,420 --> 01:50:35,600
But first, let's go

1470
01:50:35,600 --> 01:50:37,600
find there. Okay, is that the

1471
01:50:37,600 --> 01:50:40,479
Liberty that needs a book?

1472
01:50:40,479 --> 01:50:45,220
Where's the Burger King guy?

1473
01:50:45,220 --> 01:50:52,380
That's not the Burger King.

1474
01:50:52,380 --> 01:50:56,859
Where is the Burger King guy?

1475
01:50:56,859 --> 01:51:00,510
And here? No, this is like the

1476
01:51:00,510 --> 01:51:03,899
press room. No.

1477
01:51:03,899 --> 01:51:10,180
Alright, well let's just go open the

1478
01:51:10,180 --> 01:51:14,399
there's so much over here. Let's go open

1479
01:51:14,399 --> 01:51:17,470
the spade door that's over there.

1480
01:51:17,470 --> 01:51:19,470
So we can go back up. Save the game.

1481
01:51:19,470 --> 01:51:27,090
I'm back. Did you make a new meme yet?

1482
01:51:27,090 --> 01:51:30,350
Yeah, you missed it.

1483
01:51:30,350 --> 01:51:32,350
Nobody should repeat it either

1484
01:51:32,350 --> 01:51:34,350
because, I mean, come on.

1485
01:51:34,350 --> 01:51:38,579
We've got to keep that one secret for now.

1486
01:51:38,579 --> 01:51:40,880
Here's the spade door over

1487
01:51:40,880 --> 01:51:44,270
this way. Let's go check it out.

1488
01:51:44,270 --> 01:51:46,270
You missed it. I'm sorry.

1489
01:51:46,270 --> 01:51:49,920
Okay, new place.

1490
01:51:49,920 --> 01:51:55,300
Is somebody on the other side

1491
01:51:55,300 --> 01:51:57,729
of this door? I think.

1492
01:51:57,729 --> 01:52:04,829
Organize items.

1493
01:52:04,829 --> 01:52:07,779
You can discard items that have served

1494
01:52:07,779 --> 01:52:09,779
their purpose or any other key items with a check mark

1495
01:52:09,779 --> 01:52:11,779
by selecting discard. So that's it.

1496
01:52:11,779 --> 01:52:15,300
That's all the spade doors.

1497
01:52:15,300 --> 01:52:17,300
I can't do that though.

1498
01:52:17,300 --> 01:52:20,239
I'm just so attached to it already.

1499
01:52:20,239 --> 01:52:22,239
If I get rid of this, then

1500
01:52:22,239 --> 01:52:24,239
I can't have my, like, three key

1501
01:52:24,239 --> 01:52:34,539
collection. Okay.

1502
01:52:34,539 --> 01:52:42,800
I had to. Alright, we got two ways to go here.

1503
01:52:42,800 --> 01:52:45,100
Let's just try up here.

1504
01:52:45,100 --> 01:52:47,100
Do I have any boards? No.

1505
01:52:47,100 --> 01:52:49,100
Are there windows?

1506
01:52:49,100 --> 01:52:53,260
They might be a window, so just take it.

1507
01:52:53,260 --> 01:52:59,390
What's this do?

1508
01:52:59,390 --> 01:53:01,390
Okay, I need a crank.

1509
01:53:01,390 --> 01:53:06,189
I don't have a crank.

1510
01:53:06,189 --> 01:53:11,250
Art room. There's the king.

1511
01:53:11,250 --> 01:53:15,409
Nope, there's the king.

1512
01:53:15,409 --> 01:53:19,180
An article, the red stone.

1513
01:53:19,180 --> 01:53:21,180
The ruby that captivated Edward, the black

1514
01:53:21,180 --> 01:53:23,180
prince, the pearl that the queen of the Nile

1515
01:53:23,180 --> 01:53:25,180
milked dry. The diamond that led

1516
01:53:25,180 --> 01:53:27,180
a queen to the guillotine. There is

1517
01:53:27,180 --> 01:53:29,180
no end to the numbers of tales related to the

1518
01:53:29,180 --> 01:53:31,180
appeal of jewels.

1519
01:53:31,180 --> 01:53:33,180
The mysterious red stone is the latest to sparkle

1520
01:53:33,180 --> 01:53:35,180
among them. Like those other jewels,

1521
01:53:35,180 --> 01:53:37,180
this one's origin is unknown.

1522
01:53:37,180 --> 01:53:39,180
It's sad that it

1523
01:53:39,180 --> 01:53:41,180
once adorned a noble man,

1524
01:53:41,180 --> 01:53:43,180
noble woman's jeweled box, and was even dedicated

1525
01:53:43,180 --> 01:53:45,180
to a wise king. This

1526
01:53:45,180 --> 01:53:47,180
fall, this stone that's long been

1527
01:53:47,180 --> 01:53:49,180
shrouded in legacy will be on display

1528
01:53:49,180 --> 01:53:51,180
during auction. There are sure to

1529
01:53:51,180 --> 01:53:53,180
be many eager enthusiasts

1530
01:53:53,180 --> 01:53:55,180
there, but dear reader, one would do well to

1531
01:53:55,180 --> 01:53:57,180
approach with care and to

1532
01:53:57,180 --> 01:53:59,180
read this on another rainy day.

1533
01:53:59,180 --> 01:54:01,810
Shotgun.

1534
01:54:01,810 --> 01:54:04,369
Shotgun, shotgun, shotgun.

1535
01:54:04,369 --> 01:54:06,369
Alright, we've been going for like another 20

1536
01:54:06,369 --> 01:54:09,250
or 30 minutes. We good?

1537
01:54:09,250 --> 01:54:11,680
Internet fucking normal, kind

1538
01:54:11,680 --> 01:54:19,039
of? How are we doing?

1539
01:54:19,039 --> 01:54:23,180
Okay? Okay.

1540
01:54:23,180 --> 01:54:25,180
We'll just move on. We're not

1541
01:54:25,180 --> 01:54:27,939
going to talk about it, but thank you

1542
01:54:27,939 --> 01:54:29,939
for your patience. I really appreciate it.

1543
01:54:29,939 --> 01:54:32,369
There are like 3600 people here.

1544
01:54:32,369 --> 01:54:34,369
I'm fucking grateful and thankful for your

1545
01:54:34,369 --> 01:54:36,670
patience. Thank you.

1546
01:54:36,670 --> 01:54:39,420
Alright, so let's go. Now

1547
01:54:39,420 --> 01:54:41,420
I can give the Burger King his

1548
01:54:41,420 --> 01:54:43,420
Burger King late night menu.

1549
01:54:43,420 --> 01:54:48,159
What's that? King's hand.

1550
01:54:48,159 --> 01:54:55,649
A piece of plastic shaped

1551
01:54:55,649 --> 01:54:57,649
like a book. It looks like it was being held by

1552
01:54:57,649 --> 01:55:00,529
a hand. So this is bullshit.

1553
01:55:00,529 --> 01:55:02,529
This is just a replica.

1554
01:55:02,529 --> 01:55:06,350
This is a perfect copy.

1555
01:55:06,350 --> 01:55:12,689
Okay. Why can I

1556
01:55:12,689 --> 01:55:14,689
combine with hand?

1557
01:55:14,689 --> 01:55:18,380
Oh. Statue's left arm.

1558
01:55:18,380 --> 01:55:22,399
Fucking

1559
01:55:22,399 --> 01:55:25,279
wood. Can I just go find a window

1560
01:55:25,279 --> 01:55:37,250
to pour it up? Raid?

1561
01:55:37,250 --> 01:55:43,199
We got a raid? Combine

1562
01:55:43,199 --> 01:55:45,199
it with the book. Can you do it from the menu?

1563
01:55:45,199 --> 01:55:50,640
Who just came in with a raid?

1564
01:55:50,640 --> 01:56:00,619
Oh, I did.

1565
01:56:00,619 --> 01:56:02,619
No, it was all shit. It was

1566
01:56:02,619 --> 01:56:07,739
sham. Shamwow.

1567
01:56:07,739 --> 01:56:11,250
Thanks a lot, dude.

1568
01:56:11,250 --> 01:56:13,250
We haven't talked in a while. We got to like fix that.

1569
01:56:13,250 --> 01:56:17,470
We got to fix that. That's something we got to fix.

1570
01:56:17,470 --> 01:56:19,470
But thank you so much for the raid. Hope you

1571
01:56:19,470 --> 01:56:29,010
had a good stream. I thought

1572
01:56:29,010 --> 01:56:31,010
that they lived. Wait, you thought me and all

1573
01:56:31,010 --> 01:56:33,010
sham? No, we didn't live together.

1574
01:56:33,010 --> 01:56:39,390
What? Alright, but

1575
01:56:39,390 --> 01:56:41,890
thanks a lot, man. Welcome everybody.

1576
01:56:41,890 --> 01:56:44,260
I'm in the process of like, did you

1577
01:56:44,260 --> 01:56:54,560
play in Resident Evil? I can't believe

1578
01:56:54,560 --> 01:56:56,560
Mark's moving in with Jermo.

1579
01:56:56,560 --> 01:57:01,619
Oh, Diablo II

1580
01:57:01,619 --> 01:57:03,619
Paladin Shepter.

1581
01:57:03,619 --> 01:57:07,460
How's that for a reference

1582
01:57:07,460 --> 01:57:09,460
to a 2018 parabolic meme?

1583
01:57:09,460 --> 01:57:17,649
I'm getting minus two for that one. That's

1584
01:57:17,649 --> 01:57:19,649
a reference to 2016, which was then

1585
01:57:19,649 --> 01:57:21,649
revitalized in 2018.

1586
01:57:21,649 --> 01:57:23,649
No, sorry, 2014, which was revitalized

1587
01:57:23,649 --> 01:57:25,649
in 2016. And I'm referencing

1588
01:57:25,649 --> 01:57:27,649
a revitalized meme. That's how you know

1589
01:57:27,649 --> 01:57:29,649
our memes are parabolic and we've got to fucking change something

1590
01:57:29,649 --> 01:57:32,079
about that. Don't

1591
01:57:32,079 --> 01:57:34,079
sell those anymore. Don't buy those. Don't buy

1592
01:57:34,079 --> 01:57:36,079
any more fucking 700,000 games memes.

1593
01:57:36,079 --> 01:57:38,079
They're not going to be worth anything in like six months.

1594
01:57:38,079 --> 01:57:47,619
Alright, so now I got

1595
01:57:47,619 --> 01:57:49,619
the Scepter.

1596
01:57:49,619 --> 01:57:51,619
Now what the hell is you supposed to do with the Scepter?

1597
01:57:51,619 --> 01:57:57,119
Nothing else in here. No secrets.

1598
01:57:57,119 --> 01:58:03,439
Okay, let's go.

1599
01:58:03,439 --> 01:58:18,609
A jewel for your Scepter. I got a

1600
01:58:18,609 --> 01:58:21,039
jewel. Can I put that in the

1601
01:58:21,039 --> 01:58:24,819
gun? Can I like add that to

1602
01:58:24,819 --> 01:58:28,020
my gun to make it look cool?

1603
01:58:28,020 --> 01:58:30,579
Sell it. Alright, what's over here?

1604
01:58:30,579 --> 01:58:32,579
We have the crank that's over

1605
01:58:32,579 --> 01:58:34,579
here. Wait, is that a gem? Do you put a gem

1606
01:58:34,579 --> 01:58:36,579
in there? No, it's a crank. I don't have it.

1607
01:58:36,579 --> 01:58:39,460
I have a laser red dot sight.

1608
01:58:39,460 --> 01:58:42,079
We've gone to the art

1609
01:58:42,079 --> 01:58:44,079
room. There's the waiting room here.

1610
01:58:44,079 --> 01:58:46,079
The safe is in here. Let's just

1611
01:58:46,079 --> 01:58:48,640
keep moving down here. I got

1612
01:58:48,640 --> 01:58:52,800
full bullets.

1613
01:58:52,800 --> 01:58:56,510
Wait, you're fucking driving.

1614
01:58:56,510 --> 01:58:59,140
That guy, I don't even know how you got there.

1615
01:58:59,140 --> 01:59:02,590
Somebody just GTA'd over a stunt

1616
01:59:02,590 --> 01:59:12,960
jump and landed into the wall. I don't have

1617
01:59:12,960 --> 01:59:19,550
enough room for this. Alright, I got a super

1618
01:59:19,550 --> 01:59:23,199
herb. Hey, I got a superb

1619
01:59:23,199 --> 01:59:39,649
helicopter.

1620
01:59:39,649 --> 01:59:44,180
Claire?

1621
01:59:44,180 --> 01:59:48,000
You've

1622
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:50,000
been standing at that door for a

1623
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:52,000
long time. Alright, in the Claire playthrough

1624
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:54,000
do you stand there for 40 minutes?

1625
01:59:54,000 --> 02:00:02,239
Claire, it's so nice to see you.

1626
02:00:02,239 --> 02:00:04,420
How are you doing? That helicopter

1627
02:00:04,420 --> 02:00:06,420
just came out of nowhere.

1628
02:00:06,420 --> 02:00:08,720
One piece. I'm guessing

1629
02:00:08,720 --> 02:00:10,720
you don't have a key in one of those fancy

1630
02:00:10,720 --> 02:00:12,720
pockets? Unfortunately,

1631
02:00:12,720 --> 02:00:14,720
no. Come on, am I gonna

1632
02:00:14,720 --> 02:00:16,960
do a joke here?

1633
02:00:16,960 --> 02:00:18,960
Grab the gate and go,

1634
02:00:18,960 --> 02:00:20,960
pretend you're a zombie. They had an opportunity

1635
02:00:20,960 --> 02:00:22,960
to make that joke. Any luck with your brother?

1636
02:00:22,960 --> 02:00:25,520
No, not yet. Claire,

1637
02:00:25,520 --> 02:00:27,520
don't lose hope. I'm sure

1638
02:00:27,520 --> 02:00:35,649
we're gonna find him. You know what

1639
02:00:35,649 --> 02:00:37,649
that means. Yeah,

1640
02:00:37,649 --> 02:00:43,970
our time. Claire, I think we should go. Don't worry about me,

1641
02:00:43,970 --> 02:00:45,970
Leon. You take care

1642
02:00:45,970 --> 02:00:49,039
of yourself.

1643
02:00:49,039 --> 02:00:51,659
You need to go, now.

1644
02:00:51,659 --> 02:00:55,569
Okay, let's get through

1645
02:00:55,569 --> 02:00:57,569
this, both of us.

1646
02:00:57,569 --> 02:01:06,460
Marvin, I've got a situation here.

1647
02:01:06,460 --> 02:01:08,460
I can't really climb that. I'm surrounded by zombies.

1648
02:01:08,460 --> 02:01:10,460
Marvin, do you

1649
02:01:10,460 --> 02:01:12,460
copy? Marvin? Marvin!

1650
02:01:12,460 --> 02:01:14,460
I don't think Marvin's alive.

1651
02:01:14,460 --> 02:01:16,460
Alright, cutting tool. Ah!

1652
02:01:16,460 --> 02:01:19,729
God damn it!

1653
02:01:19,729 --> 02:01:22,609
The stupid wooden boards!

1654
02:01:22,609 --> 02:01:24,609
I agree. Can I just

1655
02:01:24,609 --> 02:01:26,609
board this up?

1656
02:01:26,609 --> 02:01:33,140
This ammo, too. More

1657
02:01:33,140 --> 02:01:55,279
boards!

1658
02:01:55,279 --> 02:01:57,279
I don't need the boards. This is a boardless

1659
02:01:57,279 --> 02:02:02,079
playthrough. This is a real

1660
02:02:02,079 --> 02:02:04,079
board playthrough. I know, yeah.

1661
02:02:04,079 --> 02:02:06,079
Lots of action going on.

1662
02:02:08,079 --> 02:02:11,979
Headshots only! Got it.

1663
02:02:11,979 --> 02:02:28,289
No!

1664
02:02:28,289 --> 02:02:30,289
Give me the knife. What the fuck? I thought he was...

1665
02:02:30,289 --> 02:02:33,039
Honest to God, how many times do I have to shoot you in the head?

1666
02:02:33,039 --> 02:02:36,880
Fucking bozo.

1667
02:02:36,880 --> 02:02:40,659
Alright, uh, so that is...

1668
02:02:40,659 --> 02:02:42,659
That's good.

1669
02:02:42,659 --> 02:02:44,659
Back to...

1670
02:02:44,659 --> 02:02:46,829
There's a place where I couldn't cut before.

1671
02:02:46,829 --> 02:02:48,829
I gotta go back to the main room because I gotta see

1672
02:02:48,829 --> 02:02:50,829
if that guy's okay.

1673
02:02:50,829 --> 02:02:54,420
So we gotta go...

1674
02:02:54,420 --> 02:02:57,920
straight right, left.

1675
02:02:57,920 --> 02:03:06,939
Fuck! I screwed it up!

1676
02:03:06,939 --> 02:03:09,250
I need to heal.

1677
02:03:09,250 --> 02:03:11,250
Do I care about the knife?

1678
02:03:11,250 --> 02:03:17,779
Give me the knife. Where'd the knife go?

1679
02:03:17,779 --> 02:03:19,779
Why's the knife gone?

1680
02:03:19,779 --> 02:03:22,659
The knife just disappeared. Why?

1681
02:03:22,659 --> 02:03:33,279
Okay, leave.

1682
02:03:33,279 --> 02:03:36,350
I'm just gonna... No more killing people.

1683
02:03:36,350 --> 02:03:44,420
Just gotta go. All the way down.

1684
02:03:44,420 --> 02:03:50,109
Straight.

1685
02:03:50,109 --> 02:03:52,109
Ha! Ha! Ha!

1686
02:03:52,109 --> 02:03:59,920
It's okay. Shit!

1687
02:03:59,920 --> 02:04:03,170
This is blocked!

1688
02:04:03,170 --> 02:04:05,170
Oh, god damn it. Okay, I don't have the fuse.

1689
02:04:05,170 --> 02:04:07,170
Oh, I gotta go back through the press

1690
02:04:07,170 --> 02:04:09,170
room? Back up the stairs?

1691
02:04:09,170 --> 02:04:18,319
Can I... Hold on.

1692
02:04:18,319 --> 02:04:20,319
Uh... I haven't gone through there

1693
02:04:20,319 --> 02:04:26,210
yet. I don't want any

1694
02:04:26,210 --> 02:04:29,220
swords! Just... Fine, I'll take it.

1695
02:04:29,220 --> 02:04:41,180
Okay, this way.

1696
02:04:41,180 --> 02:04:51,020
And then I can bang a left...

1697
02:04:51,020 --> 02:05:02,479
No, back up the... I'll turn the light back

1698
02:05:02,479 --> 02:05:12,979
on. Why did I turn it off?

1699
02:05:12,979 --> 02:05:14,979
Change door. Oh, ooh! Okay.

1700
02:05:14,979 --> 02:05:26,739
Okay, out here.

1701
02:05:26,739 --> 02:05:33,819
Take a left.

1702
02:05:33,819 --> 02:05:37,340
I was supposed to take a left.

1703
02:05:37,340 --> 02:05:39,340
It doesn't matter. I can go in either one of these doors.

1704
02:05:39,340 --> 02:05:48,420
Change door.

1705
02:05:48,420 --> 02:05:50,420
No, the chained one is on the other side

1706
02:05:50,420 --> 02:05:52,420
of this door. Oh,

1707
02:05:52,420 --> 02:05:54,420
Jeremy.

1708
02:05:54,420 --> 02:05:56,420
Sometimes I wish

1709
02:05:56,420 --> 02:05:58,420
that you didn't have an eighth grade

1710
02:05:58,420 --> 02:06:00,420
fucking brain.

1711
02:06:00,420 --> 02:06:21,579
No, get him off! Okay.

1712
02:06:21,579 --> 02:06:24,210
So that takes us to take a right

1713
02:06:24,210 --> 02:06:40,850
and then cut the door down.

1714
02:06:40,850 --> 02:06:42,850
This is the east office. Let's take a look around.

1715
02:06:42,850 --> 02:06:48,289
Let's explore.

1716
02:06:48,289 --> 02:06:54,819
What the fuck is that noise?

1717
02:06:54,819 --> 02:06:58,140
Flash grenade.

1718
02:06:58,140 --> 02:07:00,140
Equip on the inventory screen to use guaranteed to daze

1719
02:07:00,140 --> 02:07:04,050
and stun enemies within its effective radius.

1720
02:07:04,050 --> 02:07:06,050
Can be used to counter attack when you

1721
02:07:06,050 --> 02:07:08,050
are caught by an enemy. It's great.

1722
02:07:08,050 --> 02:07:10,050
Left bumper and then right trigger is

1723
02:07:10,050 --> 02:07:14,909
throw it. WINDOW!

1724
02:07:14,909 --> 02:07:26,350
Alright, we're good.

1725
02:07:26,350 --> 02:07:30,319
And herb. I got room for it.

1726
02:07:30,319 --> 02:07:32,319
What else is in here? Let's take a quick look.

1727
02:07:32,319 --> 02:07:35,899
Got a boarded window now.

1728
02:07:35,899 --> 02:07:37,899
If you can't get through it, watch out for the glass.

1729
02:07:37,899 --> 02:07:39,899
There's probably, what's over here?

1730
02:07:39,899 --> 02:07:42,340
More gunpowder.

1731
02:07:42,340 --> 02:07:56,220
Can't take it.

1732
02:07:56,220 --> 02:08:19,439
Electrical part.

1733
02:08:19,439 --> 02:08:22,770
Mushroom. There's so many important items in here

1734
02:08:22,770 --> 02:08:25,899
that I can't take.

1735
02:08:25,899 --> 02:08:27,899
High grade gunpowder. Shit!

1736
02:08:27,899 --> 02:08:36,670
I have to come back here and just pick

1737
02:08:36,670 --> 02:08:38,670
everything up. All these are incredibly

1738
02:08:38,670 --> 02:08:47,760
important items. I need the fuse

1739
02:08:47,760 --> 02:08:49,760
to open the door to unlock here.

1740
02:08:49,760 --> 02:08:51,760
So what am I gonna replace or get rid of?

1741
02:08:51,760 --> 02:08:53,760
I love this game.

1742
02:08:53,760 --> 02:08:55,939
Alright. I'm fine.

1743
02:08:55,939 --> 02:08:57,939
I can't combine this.

1744
02:08:57,939 --> 02:09:00,560
I can't, I just have to throw the flashbang

1745
02:09:00,560 --> 02:09:02,930
at somebody. Consume the herb?

1746
02:09:02,930 --> 02:09:07,789
I know I gotta take the fuse, but

1747
02:09:07,789 --> 02:09:09,789
what am I gonna replace the fuse with? Just like fucking

1748
02:09:09,789 --> 02:09:11,789
put the herb up my nose?

1749
02:09:11,789 --> 02:09:16,399
I could throw the flashbang, but that's

1750
02:09:16,399 --> 02:09:22,159
not worth it.

1751
02:09:22,159 --> 02:09:24,159
Or I could go to storage. Where's the storage box here?

1752
02:09:24,159 --> 02:09:26,159
Watchman's room?

1753
02:09:26,159 --> 02:09:28,159
Yeah, just hold on. Hold tight, everybody.

1754
02:09:28,159 --> 02:09:32,899
Cause then I can,

1755
02:09:32,899 --> 02:09:34,899
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1756
02:09:34,899 --> 02:09:40,850
I think so. Yeah?

1757
02:09:40,850 --> 02:09:48,590
Is there a storage box in here?

1758
02:09:48,590 --> 02:09:51,090
No? Yeah? No.

1759
02:09:51,090 --> 02:10:06,369
Okay, I'll take these.

1760
02:10:06,369 --> 02:10:09,310
Hold on.

1761
02:10:09,310 --> 02:10:12,130
Where's that storage box?

1762
02:10:12,130 --> 02:10:16,979
Yeah?

1763
02:10:16,979 --> 02:10:18,979
Press room? Bathroom?

1764
02:10:18,979 --> 02:10:27,359
I know there's one on the floor, isn't there?

1765
02:10:27,359 --> 02:10:33,699
Where's that storage box?

1766
02:10:33,699 --> 02:10:35,699
No, it's not in here.

1767
02:10:35,699 --> 02:10:37,699
Is it in here? Yeah?

1768
02:10:37,699 --> 02:10:43,329
Is it not marked?

1769
02:10:43,329 --> 02:10:45,329
Oh, I don't think, are all of them marked?

1770
02:10:45,329 --> 02:10:48,020
Oh, fuck it isn't. No, yeah, you're right.

1771
02:10:48,020 --> 02:10:50,020
There's one here.

1772
02:10:50,020 --> 02:10:52,020
That's what I'm thinking of. We're not there.

1773
02:10:52,020 --> 02:11:00,979
I could try to go back upstairs.

1774
02:11:00,979 --> 02:11:05,329
Or I'm just gonna, you know what?

1775
02:11:05,329 --> 02:11:09,039
Fuck it.

1776
02:11:09,039 --> 02:11:11,039
Oh, this is a lot. This is a lot I have to think about.

1777
02:11:11,039 --> 02:11:13,039
Because I need to, I have to just eat the herb.

1778
02:11:13,039 --> 02:11:16,050
Look, I've been doing, I've been playing so well.

1779
02:11:16,050 --> 02:11:18,050
The game has given me enough healing to heal.

1780
02:11:18,050 --> 02:11:20,050
And I'm just like throwing it right back in their face.

1781
02:11:20,050 --> 02:11:22,050
With such lines as, I don't need this shit.

1782
02:11:22,050 --> 02:11:24,050
And it's clear that I've already eaten.

1783
02:11:24,050 --> 02:11:26,050
So I'm not hungry.

1784
02:11:26,050 --> 02:11:28,050
Let's go.

1785
02:11:28,050 --> 02:11:30,739
I don't care. Let's go.

1786
02:11:30,739 --> 02:12:08,819
Don't eat it.

1787
02:12:08,819 --> 02:12:24,670
Just get hit one less time.

1788
02:12:24,670 --> 02:12:26,670
Don't you guys understand?

1789
02:12:26,670 --> 02:12:29,619
Just don't get hit one extra time.

1790
02:12:29,619 --> 02:12:31,619
And that doesn't matter.

1791
02:12:31,619 --> 02:12:34,239
Alright, where are you at? How are you doing?

1792
02:12:34,239 --> 02:12:38,909
I can hear him. He's a zombie now, isn't he?

1793
02:12:38,909 --> 02:12:45,569
Is somebody in here?

1794
02:12:45,569 --> 02:12:50,369
No, still alive. Alright, okay.

1795
02:12:50,369 --> 02:12:56,510
Alright, that's fine.

1796
02:12:56,510 --> 02:12:58,939
Storage box.

1797
02:12:58,939 --> 02:13:04,579
Streamer wets himself on stream.

1798
02:13:04,579 --> 02:13:06,579
Oh, you would know if that were the case.

1799
02:13:06,579 --> 02:13:08,579
Alright, I'm gonna store the ruby.

1800
02:13:08,579 --> 02:13:10,579
Bring the key card.

1801
02:13:10,579 --> 02:13:13,649
Store the...

1802
02:13:13,649 --> 02:13:15,649
Look at all these things I have in here.

1803
02:13:15,649 --> 02:13:20,640
I could just use the gunpowder or...

1804
02:13:20,640 --> 02:13:24,100
I could store the flash grenade.

1805
02:13:24,100 --> 02:13:32,220
Let me go get...

1806
02:13:32,220 --> 02:13:34,220
I just burp so fucking loud.

1807
02:13:34,220 --> 02:13:36,220
That's why I don't do face cam.

1808
02:13:36,220 --> 02:13:38,220
That's why I don't have mic ever.

1809
02:13:38,220 --> 02:13:42,380
Alright.

1810
02:13:42,380 --> 02:13:44,380
I want another water.

1811
02:13:44,380 --> 02:17:24,930
I'll be right back.

1812
02:17:24,930 --> 02:17:27,809
It's so dark in here.

1813
02:17:27,809 --> 02:17:31,649
I don't like how dark it is in here.

1814
02:17:31,649 --> 02:17:33,649
Can I turn the lights back on?

1815
02:17:33,649 --> 02:17:41,379
What's going on?

1816
02:17:41,379 --> 02:17:43,809
All the hearts?

1817
02:17:43,809 --> 02:17:48,610
Why is everybody doing hearts?

1818
02:17:48,610 --> 02:17:54,819
Is there any particular reason?

1819
02:17:54,819 --> 02:17:58,459
Show my pants.

1820
02:17:58,459 --> 02:18:01,280
What's wrong with my pants?

1821
02:18:01,280 --> 02:18:03,280
They're just regular pants.

1822
02:18:03,280 --> 02:18:07,500
Because you peed yourself and we feel bad.

1823
02:18:07,500 --> 02:18:12,750
Alright, I don't need this.

1824
02:18:12,750 --> 02:18:15,950
I wanna get the shotgun.

1825
02:18:15,950 --> 02:18:17,950
But then I'm gonna have a permanent shotgun.

1826
02:18:17,950 --> 02:18:19,950
What am I supposed to do?

1827
02:18:19,950 --> 02:18:24,690
I have to think about this stuff because then

1828
02:18:24,690 --> 02:18:26,690
what am I supposed to do?

1829
02:18:26,690 --> 02:18:28,690
Shotgun is gonna go here.

1830
02:18:28,690 --> 02:18:32,850
Shotgun bullets.

1831
02:18:32,850 --> 02:18:40,209
When do I get the inventory upgraded?

1832
02:18:40,209 --> 02:18:44,819
Alright, this is a very...

1833
02:18:44,819 --> 02:18:46,989
I like this a lot.

1834
02:18:46,989 --> 02:18:50,000
So we got press room.

1835
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:52,559
Bathroom.

1836
02:18:52,559 --> 02:18:54,559
Where are the wire cutters?

1837
02:18:54,559 --> 02:18:57,250
Locked door.

1838
02:18:57,250 --> 02:18:59,250
Chained door. So I can go back here.

1839
02:18:59,250 --> 02:19:03,840
Let me see the...

1840
02:19:03,840 --> 02:19:07,299
Let me see the other floors.

1841
02:19:07,299 --> 02:19:09,299
Okay, so I got one more chained door

1842
02:19:09,299 --> 02:19:11,299
to cut.

1843
02:19:11,299 --> 02:19:13,600
And then that will be done.

1844
02:19:13,600 --> 02:19:15,600
So let me go open this chained door.

1845
02:19:15,600 --> 02:19:18,100
Well, Herbert

1846
02:19:18,100 --> 02:19:20,100
gives five community subs. Thanks a lot, Herbert.

1847
02:19:20,100 --> 02:19:23,360
Thank you, all of you.

1848
02:19:23,360 --> 02:19:28,540
You guys are fucking incredible. Thank you.

1849
02:19:28,540 --> 02:19:30,540
You guys are fucking unbelievable to me.

1850
02:19:30,540 --> 02:19:33,100
Thank you so much.

1851
02:19:33,100 --> 02:19:39,379
Chained door.

1852
02:19:39,379 --> 02:19:43,790
Because then I can get rid of that.

1853
02:19:43,790 --> 02:19:45,790
Let me go get rid of the pliers.

1854
02:19:45,790 --> 02:19:47,790
Because I'm not gonna need them more after this.

1855
02:19:47,790 --> 02:19:50,159
Let me set a waypoint right here.

1856
02:19:50,159 --> 02:19:52,159
So straight through the reception, bang a right.

1857
02:19:52,159 --> 02:19:54,159
Straight through the reception,

1858
02:19:54,159 --> 02:19:56,159
straight through the door, bang a right.

1859
02:19:56,159 --> 02:20:00,639
Operations room, chained door.

1860
02:20:00,639 --> 02:20:08,620
Okay, straight through.

1861
02:20:08,620 --> 02:20:10,799
Then that brings us to here.

1862
02:20:10,799 --> 02:20:12,799
Let me go straight all the way down to the right.

1863
02:20:12,799 --> 02:20:14,799
Do I have any boards? I don't have any boards.

1864
02:20:14,799 --> 02:20:16,799
Operations room, straight all the way down.

1865
02:20:16,799 --> 02:20:26,590
The windows are now open.

1866
02:20:26,590 --> 02:20:28,590
Now I understand why I should have boarded those windows.

1867
02:20:28,590 --> 02:20:34,139
Damn it!

1868
02:20:34,139 --> 02:20:36,319
Spin? Do I spin?

1869
02:20:36,319 --> 02:20:48,139
Okay.

1870
02:20:48,139 --> 02:20:51,729
This is why there's so many of them.

1871
02:20:51,729 --> 02:20:55,819
There's like 300

1872
02:20:55,819 --> 02:20:57,819
enemies against me right now.

1873
02:20:57,819 --> 02:20:59,819
Chained, this will be it. I'm gonna use it.

1874
02:20:59,819 --> 02:21:05,969
That's the last door that's locked up.

1875
02:21:05,969 --> 02:21:07,969
Yup, okay. Goodbye.

1876
02:21:07,969 --> 02:21:09,969
Thank you. It was very nice of you to be here

1877
02:21:09,969 --> 02:21:11,969
and give me the check box, but now you're gone.

1878
02:21:11,969 --> 02:21:13,969
What's in here?

1879
02:21:13,969 --> 02:21:17,229
Electr- jag- electronic

1880
02:21:17,229 --> 02:21:24,780
gadget. I said I was gonna

1881
02:21:24,780 --> 02:21:26,780
get a water and I just got another cup of coffee.

1882
02:21:26,780 --> 02:21:30,690
I think he might be deranged.

1883
02:21:30,690 --> 02:21:32,690
Alright, uh, a medium-sized

1884
02:21:32,690 --> 02:21:34,690
electronic gadget. Let's examine it.

1885
02:21:34,690 --> 02:21:40,319
Some sort of electronic gadget.

1886
02:21:40,319 --> 02:21:46,909
Uh, needs

1887
02:21:46,909 --> 02:21:49,340
a battery. A detonator for

1888
02:21:49,340 --> 02:21:51,340
C4 explosive. It's missing a battery.

1889
02:21:51,340 --> 02:21:56,319
Okay, so I'm gonna store

1890
02:21:56,319 --> 02:21:58,319
this until I find a battery for it.

1891
02:21:58,319 --> 02:22:03,809
Lobster room.

1892
02:22:03,809 --> 02:22:08,100
How am I doing on health? Fine.

1893
02:22:08,100 --> 02:22:11,489
I'm fine.

1894
02:22:11,489 --> 02:22:33,680
Fuck is that?

1895
02:22:33,680 --> 02:22:36,690
What was that? Oh, I unlocked it?

1896
02:22:36,690 --> 02:22:42,579
There's a flashbang in there.

1897
02:22:42,579 --> 02:22:44,579
Okay, locker terminal.

1898
02:22:44,579 --> 02:22:46,940
I got the electronic gadget.

1899
02:22:46,940 --> 02:22:53,520
It's a flash grenade.

1900
02:22:53,520 --> 02:22:55,520
All headshots. I'm

1901
02:22:55,520 --> 02:22:57,520
sorry, but when I went downstairs

1902
02:22:57,520 --> 02:22:59,520
to get some water and a coffee,

1903
02:22:59,520 --> 02:23:01,889
I was immediately backseated.

1904
02:23:01,889 --> 02:23:03,889
Like, it was- Atalix was waiting

1905
02:23:03,889 --> 02:23:05,889
at the bottom of the stairs for me. He was sitting there

1906
02:23:05,889 --> 02:23:07,889
going like this way. He knew I was gonna take a break.

1907
02:23:07,889 --> 02:23:09,889
And when I opened up the door and looked over, he said

1908
02:23:09,889 --> 02:23:11,889
it's bad if you just shoot

1909
02:23:11,889 --> 02:23:13,889
heads. He said, shoot up the limbs and stuff.

1910
02:23:13,889 --> 02:23:15,889
It'll help you. And I'm like, oh,

1911
02:23:15,889 --> 02:23:17,889
okay. How long have you been standing there for?

1912
02:23:17,889 --> 02:23:19,889
He's like, the whole time. I've just been watching on my phone

1913
02:23:19,889 --> 02:23:21,889
waiting for you to come down. I'm like,

1914
02:23:21,889 --> 02:23:24,379
alright, thanks, man.

1915
02:23:24,379 --> 02:23:28,930
Alright, we got the records room here. Let's go in.

1916
02:23:28,930 --> 02:23:45,100
I don't have that key.

1917
02:23:45,100 --> 02:23:47,100
Damn it, I fucking missed him.

1918
02:23:47,100 --> 02:23:55,020
Heart door.

1919
02:23:55,020 --> 02:23:57,329
Sync. Locker terminal.

1920
02:23:57,329 --> 02:23:59,329
Weapons locker. Ah, the weapons locker. But

1921
02:23:59,329 --> 02:24:01,329
I don't have enough room for that.

1922
02:24:01,329 --> 02:24:08,500
What's on the table? Nothing else in here

1923
02:24:08,500 --> 02:24:10,500
that I need. I got the electronic equipment.

1924
02:24:10,500 --> 02:24:13,309
I have just screwed myself

1925
02:24:13,309 --> 02:24:20,479
so much.

1926
02:24:20,479 --> 02:24:22,479
Why did you-

1927
02:24:22,479 --> 02:24:29,969
Ah, okay.

1928
02:24:29,969 --> 02:24:32,270
Weapons locker. We're gonna jump through here.

1929
02:24:32,270 --> 02:24:37,709
And I know I'm

1930
02:24:37,709 --> 02:24:39,709
a compulsive

1931
02:24:39,709 --> 02:24:41,709
map viewer. I know I am. But I have

1932
02:24:41,709 --> 02:24:44,020
to. Straight left left.

1933
02:24:44,020 --> 02:24:56,610
What?

1934
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:10,930
Was it a dud?

1935
02:25:10,930 --> 02:25:14,639
Alright, I got the key card. I can finally get

1936
02:25:14,639 --> 02:25:21,739
rid of this now. I'll put it

1937
02:25:21,739 --> 02:25:23,739
in the locker. Give me the shotgun. Give me the shotgun

1938
02:25:23,739 --> 02:25:27,139
shells. Nice.

1939
02:25:27,139 --> 02:25:29,139
W870.

1940
02:25:29,139 --> 02:25:32,270
Let's go ahead and load it. Change weapons.

1941
02:25:32,270 --> 02:25:34,270
So it's down. Let's go ahead and load it.

1942
02:25:37,219 --> 02:25:39,520
Fucking asshole. What are you doing in here?

1943
02:25:39,520 --> 02:25:46,690
What is going on?

1944
02:25:48,690 --> 02:26:10,940
I got the shotgun. I'm fucking

1945
02:26:10,940 --> 02:26:12,940
like itchy and stuff. That's how you know

1946
02:26:12,940 --> 02:26:14,940
shit's getting all actually wild.

1947
02:26:14,940 --> 02:26:17,819
Okay. I need

1948
02:26:17,819 --> 02:26:20,059
to go

1949
02:26:20,059 --> 02:26:22,430
back here

1950
02:26:22,430 --> 02:26:24,430
to the east office to get myself

1951
02:26:24,430 --> 02:26:26,860
the handle and

1952
02:26:26,860 --> 02:26:28,860
some gunpowder. And then the valve

1953
02:26:28,860 --> 02:26:30,860
goes into the valve unit which was over- okay

1954
02:26:30,860 --> 02:26:32,860
so we gotta turn around

1955
02:26:32,860 --> 02:26:34,860
through west office. So through the door

1956
02:26:34,860 --> 02:26:36,860
turn around through door

1957
02:26:36,860 --> 02:26:38,860
out the other door into the main hall.

1958
02:26:38,860 --> 02:26:40,860
Save game.

1959
02:26:40,860 --> 02:26:51,280
You're not gonna get up, are you?

1960
02:26:51,280 --> 02:27:02,479
How you doing? You good?

1961
02:27:02,479 --> 02:27:04,780
Hey dude, I found a shotgun.

1962
02:27:04,780 --> 02:27:12,190
We're gonna be just fine. Okay.

1963
02:27:12,190 --> 02:27:14,190
So there- I got shotgun shells

1964
02:27:14,190 --> 02:27:16,190
in here. Get them out.

1965
02:27:16,190 --> 02:27:20,290
Wooden board. Electronic device

1966
02:27:20,290 --> 02:27:22,290
store it. Wooden board store it.

1967
02:27:22,290 --> 02:27:24,530
Gunpowder. Um,

1968
02:27:24,530 --> 02:27:26,530
first aid spray maybe. No. Red herb

1969
02:27:26,530 --> 02:27:30,180
no. Red jewel

1970
02:27:30,180 --> 02:27:32,180
maybe is what I'll need in here soon. I don't know.

1971
02:27:32,180 --> 02:27:35,700
Yo, shave tonight.

1972
02:27:35,700 --> 02:27:42,030
I'm not shaving ever again.

1973
02:27:42,030 --> 02:27:45,229
Save it. This will take us out there.

1974
02:27:45,229 --> 02:27:47,229
I got- I can get the valve now

1975
02:27:47,229 --> 02:27:49,229
which is just straight through. Go in, grab valve.

1976
02:27:49,229 --> 02:27:56,719
Is there a minute- enemy in

1977
02:27:56,719 --> 02:28:01,069
here? No. You can only hold

1978
02:28:01,069 --> 02:28:03,069
six bullets in a shotgun. That's fine.

1979
02:28:03,069 --> 02:28:06,079
This thing is broken.

1980
02:28:06,079 --> 02:28:16,690
No, nevermind. Let's bring this in

1981
02:28:16,690 --> 02:28:18,690
here. Give me the valve

1982
02:28:18,690 --> 02:28:21,440
which is in this office. Is somebody in the office?

1983
02:28:21,440 --> 02:28:23,440
I think there might be somebody lying on the ground.

1984
02:28:23,440 --> 02:28:26,959
No. Okay. Round

1985
02:28:26,959 --> 02:28:30,290
handle. Take it.

1986
02:28:30,290 --> 02:28:32,290
Super gunpowder. Take it.

1987
02:28:32,290 --> 02:28:37,729
Now, where

1988
02:28:37,729 --> 02:28:43,100
was that valve?

1989
02:28:43,100 --> 02:28:45,100
Valve was

1990
02:28:45,100 --> 02:28:51,379
Jack valve.

1991
02:28:51,379 --> 02:28:54,510
Second floor. So we gotta go

1992
02:28:54,510 --> 02:28:57,260
main hall. Is there a way

1993
02:28:57,260 --> 02:28:59,260
I can get up from here? A fire escape maybe?

1994
02:28:59,260 --> 02:29:02,020
No, that's too far away. We gotta go

1995
02:29:02,020 --> 02:29:04,639
main hall. So just go back to where I

1996
02:29:04,639 --> 02:29:06,940
was. Save game.

1997
02:29:06,940 --> 02:29:10,850
Am I doing a joke or am I just acting

1998
02:29:10,850 --> 02:29:13,409
weird? What do you mean?

1999
02:29:13,409 --> 02:29:19,040
The way he's narrating everything is

2000
02:29:19,040 --> 02:29:25,440
very YouTube streamer.

2001
02:29:25,440 --> 02:29:27,940
Am I acting weird?

2002
02:29:27,940 --> 02:29:34,959
Am I?

2003
02:29:34,959 --> 02:29:36,959
I can't even

2004
02:29:36,959 --> 02:29:38,959
tell.

2005
02:29:38,959 --> 02:29:46,770
Let's go back to the main hall. It's because I'm saying

2006
02:29:46,770 --> 02:29:52,979
everything I'm doing?

2007
02:29:52,979 --> 02:30:00,020
Is that the issue?

2008
02:30:00,020 --> 02:30:02,020
It's very tuber-like what you're doing.

2009
02:30:02,020 --> 02:30:04,450
Okay, so we get to main hall and then

2010
02:30:04,450 --> 02:30:06,450
I'm gonna activate this device. That's the

2011
02:30:06,450 --> 02:30:10,350
problem. I guess.

2012
02:30:10,350 --> 02:30:14,879
Okay. I need to use all this

2013
02:30:14,879 --> 02:30:16,879
but I'm gonna store the gunpowder. I have a lot of

2014
02:30:16,879 --> 02:30:19,309
gunpowder. I'm doing it again.

2015
02:30:19,309 --> 02:30:57,569
But I would be... How do I get over

2016
02:30:57,569 --> 02:31:02,690
there? Hey, you're doing great. Hey, thanks.

2017
02:31:02,690 --> 02:31:08,379
Is there a way I gotta go up?

2018
02:31:08,379 --> 02:31:10,620
Can I climb up?

2019
02:31:10,620 --> 02:31:14,260
I don't know. Who has any

2020
02:31:14,260 --> 02:31:16,260
damn idea?

2021
02:31:16,260 --> 02:31:38,399
I'm on the third floor now. Wrong floor.

2022
02:31:38,399 --> 02:31:47,420
I'm gonna go up and around here and then

2023
02:31:47,420 --> 02:31:49,420
down, which will take me. Okay, so I gotta go around

2024
02:31:49,420 --> 02:31:52,430
through the...

2025
02:31:52,430 --> 02:31:57,420
Yeah.

2026
02:31:57,420 --> 02:32:05,489
Bullets. I didn't miss anything though.

2027
02:32:05,489 --> 02:32:07,489
Like that. Some guys

2028
02:32:07,489 --> 02:32:09,489
scribblings.

2029
02:32:09,489 --> 02:32:13,200
Damn, those corporate assholes. They cut me off.

2030
02:32:13,200 --> 02:32:15,200
After all I've done for them but that's...

2031
02:32:15,200 --> 02:32:17,200
If that's how it's gonna be, so be it.

2032
02:32:17,200 --> 02:32:19,200
I'm gonna have a little fun of my own as the world

2033
02:32:19,200 --> 02:32:21,200
goes to shit. I boarded all those

2034
02:32:21,200 --> 02:32:23,200
filthy pigs up in a steel pen

2035
02:32:23,200 --> 02:32:26,590
and set some C4.

2036
02:32:26,590 --> 02:32:28,590
All I gotta do is detonate it.

2037
02:32:28,590 --> 02:32:30,829
Okay. It's no fun

2038
02:32:30,829 --> 02:32:32,829
if it's over too soon so maybe I'll give that

2039
02:32:32,829 --> 02:32:34,829
one raving loon something to really

2040
02:32:34,829 --> 02:32:37,069
squeal about. Yeah, maybe I'll

2041
02:32:37,069 --> 02:32:39,069
give him a little toy and tell him kill the guy

2042
02:32:39,069 --> 02:32:41,069
next to you and I'll spare the others.

2043
02:32:41,069 --> 02:32:43,569
I wonder what he'll do.

2044
02:32:43,569 --> 02:32:45,569
You yell about justice and pride but how

2045
02:32:45,569 --> 02:32:47,569
many times did you go against me, your own

2046
02:32:47,569 --> 02:32:49,809
superior? Okay, you're such a

2047
02:32:49,809 --> 02:32:52,370
good cop so good you had to die.

2048
02:32:52,370 --> 02:32:54,370
This is fun. I need some music

2049
02:32:54,370 --> 02:32:58,139
for this. Okay. So

2050
02:32:58,139 --> 02:33:00,139
there's people locked up somewhere?

2051
02:33:00,139 --> 02:33:03,540
What the hell is this? Hip

2052
02:33:03,540 --> 02:33:10,620
pouch. Oh.

2053
02:33:10,620 --> 02:33:12,620
That's exactly what I wanted. Thank god.

2054
02:33:12,620 --> 02:33:16,399
So that's how you increase

2055
02:33:16,399 --> 02:33:18,770
your size. Got it.

2056
02:33:18,770 --> 02:33:25,940
Grandfather clock.

2057
02:33:25,940 --> 02:33:37,309
Nothing else over here.

2058
02:33:37,309 --> 02:33:41,520
I don't want to miss anything.

2059
02:33:41,520 --> 02:33:43,520
So what is this going to lead to? This will lead

2060
02:33:43,520 --> 02:33:45,520
out to where I want to go.

2061
02:33:45,520 --> 02:33:58,239
Do I have any boards? No.

2062
02:33:58,239 --> 02:34:01,059
Unnecessary though.

2063
02:34:01,059 --> 02:34:06,239
Then I could be able to take

2064
02:34:06,239 --> 02:34:08,239
the stairs down and

2065
02:34:08,239 --> 02:34:10,239
there's the valve.

2066
02:34:10,239 --> 02:34:14,770
Interesting. I still

2067
02:34:14,770 --> 02:34:27,379
don't know the combination of this shit.

2068
02:34:27,379 --> 02:34:31,729
Dick. I have to shoot this

2069
02:34:31,729 --> 02:34:33,729
guy because there's nowhere for me to get out of here.

2070
02:34:33,729 --> 02:34:41,840
What the? I'm stooping into the

2071
02:34:41,840 --> 02:34:43,840
heads. I'm only shooting in heads.

2072
02:34:43,840 --> 02:34:56,829
Okay.

2073
02:34:56,829 --> 02:34:58,829
So I could heal full.

2074
02:34:58,829 --> 02:35:00,829
I'm not supposed

2075
02:35:00,829 --> 02:35:02,829
to have these. I'm not supposed to take this right now.

2076
02:35:02,829 --> 02:35:10,829
Metallix, I shot him in the

2077
02:35:10,829 --> 02:35:12,829
leg and the stomach and the groin

2078
02:35:12,829 --> 02:35:14,829
and I went against my own rule of headshots

2079
02:35:14,829 --> 02:35:17,840
only and I got bit. This is

2080
02:35:17,840 --> 02:35:19,840
your fault. You told me to

2081
02:35:19,840 --> 02:35:26,879
do this. Shoot him in the leg more

2082
02:35:26,879 --> 02:35:28,879
than one time. That's not what you said. You said

2083
02:35:28,879 --> 02:35:30,879
shoot him in the leg. And I said, okay.

2084
02:35:30,879 --> 02:35:35,739
Alright. Valve is back here.

2085
02:35:35,739 --> 02:35:43,420
Alright. There's bullets over here though.

2086
02:35:43,420 --> 02:35:45,420
Only a Sith. Only a Sith is

2087
02:35:45,420 --> 02:35:47,420
an absolute, right? That's what you would say in that accent.

2088
02:35:47,420 --> 02:36:01,809
Let's turn it off.

2089
02:36:01,809 --> 02:36:05,139
I feel like I'm missing

2090
02:36:05,139 --> 02:36:07,139
some things with the locker combinations.

2091
02:36:07,139 --> 02:36:09,139
But it's all good. Alright.

2092
02:36:09,139 --> 02:36:13,549
Anything I can do in here.

2093
02:36:13,549 --> 02:36:20,909
Hot water tank. Cool.

2094
02:36:20,909 --> 02:36:25,780
Dead or alive?

2095
02:36:25,780 --> 02:36:42,909
Yeah. Dead.

2096
02:36:42,909 --> 02:36:47,180
That's fine.

2097
02:36:47,180 --> 02:36:49,680
What is this? Gunpowder.

2098
02:36:49,680 --> 02:36:51,680
I'm gonna, just, I'm gonna combine it.

2099
02:36:51,680 --> 02:36:56,100
I have so much handgun bullets.

2100
02:36:56,100 --> 02:36:59,299
Might as well do it. Just on one of them, right?

2101
02:36:59,299 --> 02:37:12,850
Giving me

2102
02:37:12,850 --> 02:37:21,489
a lot of ammunition here.

2103
02:37:21,489 --> 02:37:23,489
So this is bringing me back here. There's a

2104
02:37:23,489 --> 02:37:29,379
door here and a door there.

2105
02:37:29,379 --> 02:37:32,129
It's one of those, shh, don't

2106
02:37:32,129 --> 02:37:34,430
walk silently.

2107
02:37:34,430 --> 02:37:36,979
Ah! What?

2108
02:37:36,979 --> 02:37:38,979
He just did like a street fighter move to me.

2109
02:37:38,979 --> 02:37:57,920
Oh my god.

2110
02:37:57,920 --> 02:38:00,530
I have no health now. Oh

2111
02:38:00,530 --> 02:38:04,819
shit. Whatever. I don't think there's anybody in here.

2112
02:38:04,819 --> 02:38:09,040
Keeping the shotgun out though.

2113
02:38:09,040 --> 02:38:11,600
I'm not gonna let that happen again.

2114
02:38:11,600 --> 02:38:14,610
Flashbang.

2115
02:38:14,610 --> 02:38:31,229
Dart. Throwing dart.

2116
02:38:31,229 --> 02:38:37,440
First aid spray. Alright. There's an office

2117
02:38:37,440 --> 02:38:39,440
in here. I'm not gonna activate that computer just yet.

2118
02:38:39,440 --> 02:38:43,149
What's in the office?

2119
02:38:43,149 --> 02:38:47,870
Internal memo.

2120
02:38:47,870 --> 02:38:49,870
Oh, office supply, internal relocation

2121
02:38:49,870 --> 02:38:51,870
notice. Heat resistant

2122
02:38:51,870 --> 02:38:53,870
three number combination safe.

2123
02:38:53,870 --> 02:38:56,180
Moved from Star's office

2124
02:38:56,180 --> 02:38:58,180
to West office first floor.

2125
02:38:58,180 --> 02:39:01,120
Right? So West office.

2126
02:39:01,120 --> 02:39:03,120
The combo is left

2127
02:39:03,120 --> 02:39:05,120
nine, right fifteen, left seven.

2128
02:39:05,120 --> 02:39:07,420
Nine, fifteen, seven.

2129
02:39:07,420 --> 02:39:10,110
Nine, fifteen, okay.

2130
02:39:10,110 --> 02:39:12,110
Please change the combo as soon as possible.

2131
02:39:12,110 --> 02:39:14,110
There's a combination of the safe downstairs.

2132
02:39:14,110 --> 02:39:20,879
Very cool. You guys need to

2133
02:39:20,879 --> 02:39:24,340
and there's the battery. That goes into

2134
02:39:24,340 --> 02:39:28,180
that unit. Alright, nice.

2135
02:39:28,180 --> 02:39:31,700
I'm making progress here.

2136
02:39:31,700 --> 02:39:34,129
Plenty of bullets. Some red

2137
02:39:34,129 --> 02:39:38,350
herb. Out of space.

2138
02:39:38,350 --> 02:39:51,139
No I'm not. I have so many

2139
02:39:51,139 --> 02:39:53,139
of those. It's worth doing at least once maybe.

2140
02:39:53,139 --> 02:39:56,379
Throw away

2141
02:39:56,379 --> 02:39:58,379
the gunpowder.

2142
02:39:58,379 --> 02:40:02,540
Now that's not correct.

2143
02:40:02,540 --> 02:40:05,040
Matilda. Wait, wait.

2144
02:40:05,040 --> 02:40:07,340
Do I have a CD or a thumb drive or something I need?

2145
02:40:07,340 --> 02:40:11,379
What about the battery?

2146
02:40:11,379 --> 02:40:18,850
Failed to authenticate account.

2147
02:40:18,850 --> 02:40:20,850
I need a USB dongle

2148
02:40:20,850 --> 02:40:23,729
to unlock this door.

2149
02:40:23,729 --> 02:40:32,989
Looks like a different gun.

2150
02:40:32,989 --> 02:40:34,989
Back out to where the liquor is.

2151
02:40:34,989 --> 02:40:37,360
Lightning Hawk times three.

2152
02:40:37,360 --> 02:40:41,459
So, I got a battery

2153
02:40:41,459 --> 02:40:43,459
and I got the safe combination to the door

2154
02:40:43,459 --> 02:40:45,459
to the safe down here. So, we need to go

2155
02:40:45,459 --> 02:40:47,760
down, which is

2156
02:40:47,760 --> 02:40:49,760
West Office. Safe is back

2157
02:40:49,760 --> 02:40:54,180
here. It's for that. So, I'm gonna get out

2158
02:40:54,180 --> 02:40:56,540
here and back downstairs.

2159
02:40:56,540 --> 02:41:01,280
Make our way to the West Office.

2160
02:41:01,280 --> 02:41:03,280
Let me just keep going. No, I need to get

2161
02:41:03,280 --> 02:41:08,079
to the save point.

2162
02:41:08,079 --> 02:41:12,239
Behind you. Stop doing

2163
02:41:12,239 --> 02:41:15,309
that. You know how fucking neurotic

2164
02:41:15,309 --> 02:41:17,940
I am? Don't do that. Don't

2165
02:41:17,940 --> 02:42:26,290
do that to me. I'll come back here after

2166
02:42:26,290 --> 02:42:28,290
I go back.

2167
02:42:28,290 --> 02:42:41,069
Right in the fucking brain!

2168
02:42:41,069 --> 02:42:48,110
What the fuck? He's still alive?

2169
02:42:48,110 --> 02:42:51,379
No!

2170
02:42:51,379 --> 02:42:55,979
Die, die, die, die, die, die!

2171
02:42:55,979 --> 02:43:01,870
What the fuck?

2172
02:43:01,870 --> 02:43:15,120
What was that?

2173
02:43:15,120 --> 02:43:17,360
What was that clown

2174
02:43:17,360 --> 02:43:33,739
move? He just

2175
02:43:33,739 --> 02:43:35,739
fucking threw himself into the corner.

2176
02:43:35,739 --> 02:43:45,020
Does he come through the door?

2177
02:43:45,020 --> 02:43:52,379
Okay, wait, wait, I'll...

2178
02:43:52,379 --> 02:43:56,219
He can't go through there, right?

2179
02:43:56,219 --> 02:44:00,260
Does the door eventually explode?

2180
02:44:00,260 --> 02:44:08,450
So, this is... I need the horse.

2181
02:44:08,450 --> 02:44:17,340
It's this right here, right here. No.

2182
02:44:17,340 --> 02:44:19,340
Where is it? This one.

2183
02:44:19,340 --> 02:44:21,780
So, it's Pisces,

2184
02:44:21,780 --> 02:44:25,040
fish, crab,

2185
02:44:25,040 --> 02:44:27,860
vase, I guess.

2186
02:44:27,860 --> 02:44:45,700
Give me the disc. It fits.

2187
02:44:45,700 --> 02:44:48,319
I really thought three

2188
02:44:48,319 --> 02:44:50,319
shotgun blasts point blank would do it.

2189
02:44:50,319 --> 02:44:52,319
Apparently not, and there's a police station

2190
02:44:52,319 --> 02:44:55,069
up the floor map. Nice.

2191
02:44:55,069 --> 02:45:00,299
I can't go in the linen room.

2192
02:45:00,299 --> 02:45:02,299
This is going to take me back to the library and then back down to the

2193
02:45:02,299 --> 02:45:06,139
main hall. Okay,

2194
02:45:06,139 --> 02:45:10,690
so I did everything I could do there.

2195
02:45:10,690 --> 02:45:12,690
Fish, crab? No, fish, then crab,

2196
02:45:12,690 --> 02:45:14,690
then vase.

2197
02:45:14,690 --> 02:45:17,629
I'm going to put this back in there and then

2198
02:45:17,629 --> 02:45:24,540
we'll go from there. He's not going to be

2199
02:45:24,540 --> 02:45:27,809
behind this door, right?

2200
02:45:27,809 --> 02:45:30,559
They are, though. Take a right.

2201
02:45:30,559 --> 02:45:39,120
Here we are. Beautiful.

2202
02:45:39,120 --> 02:45:51,649
Safe point. Stick it

2203
02:45:51,649 --> 02:45:59,780
in there. You're in Castle

2204
02:45:59,780 --> 02:46:01,780
Cainhurst. That's a pretty great reference,

2205
02:46:01,780 --> 02:46:07,409
actually. So,

2206
02:46:07,409 --> 02:46:10,290
gunpowder, gunpowder,

2207
02:46:10,290 --> 02:46:12,459
the jewels. Let me

2208
02:46:12,459 --> 02:46:14,459
put the battery in the detonator.

2209
02:46:14,459 --> 02:46:27,549
Detonator.

2210
02:46:27,549 --> 02:46:29,549
It looks like it's just

2211
02:46:29,549 --> 02:46:33,649
for C4.

2212
02:46:33,649 --> 02:46:37,809
Red herb. No blue

2213
02:46:37,809 --> 02:46:40,690
herbs. Alright, so I got

2214
02:46:40,690 --> 02:46:42,690
gunpowder and then I got high grade gunpowder.

2215
02:46:42,690 --> 02:46:44,690
Should I do one

2216
02:46:44,690 --> 02:46:49,809
and two? What was it? What are you doing?

2217
02:46:49,809 --> 02:46:56,319
What are you guys doing?

2218
02:46:56,319 --> 02:46:58,319
I have to increase the visibility in my room. Hold on.

2219
02:46:58,319 --> 02:47:05,170
Okay, that's better.

2220
02:47:05,170 --> 02:47:08,239
Every hour I have to increase the visibility because the sun's

2221
02:47:08,239 --> 02:47:12,270
going down.

2222
02:47:12,270 --> 02:47:14,270
BB pistol, BY

2223
02:47:14,270 --> 02:47:17,659
shotgun. Let's do

2224
02:47:17,659 --> 02:47:19,659
a BY.

2225
02:47:19,659 --> 02:47:22,670
Let's make some shotgun shells. Why not?

2226
02:47:22,670 --> 02:47:31,500
Might as well use them.

2227
02:47:31,500 --> 02:47:36,430
I could do it again. I'm going to do it again.

2228
02:47:36,430 --> 02:47:42,000
I'm one of those people that will never use

2229
02:47:42,000 --> 02:47:45,709
these. I just won't.

2230
02:47:45,709 --> 02:47:48,780
I'm so obsessed

2231
02:47:48,780 --> 02:47:52,940
with them. No, don't use them.

2232
02:47:52,940 --> 02:47:54,940
You're going to need them later. Alright.

2233
02:47:54,940 --> 02:47:59,360
That's a hundred dollars

2234
02:47:59,360 --> 02:48:01,360
from La Cranda.

2235
02:48:01,360 --> 02:48:04,930
Hundred bucks.

2236
02:48:04,930 --> 02:48:07,489
Thank you, La Cranda.

2237
02:48:07,489 --> 02:48:09,489
What's going on, Jerma? I hope to see you playing Fortnite

2238
02:48:09,489 --> 02:48:11,489
tonight with Thanos. I know I'd want

2239
02:48:11,489 --> 02:48:13,489
to be there. Much love.

2240
02:48:13,489 --> 02:48:15,920
That's not going to happen.

2241
02:48:15,920 --> 02:48:17,920
I'm not going to play Fortnite ever.

2242
02:48:17,920 --> 02:48:20,670
For any reason.

2243
02:48:20,670 --> 02:48:22,670
Thanos is in

2244
02:48:22,670 --> 02:48:24,670
Fortnite. Sometimes I forget about that.

2245
02:48:24,670 --> 02:48:31,629
Why?

2246
02:48:31,629 --> 02:48:33,870
Thank you so much

2247
02:48:33,870 --> 02:48:35,870
for your hundred fucking dollars. I really appreciate

2248
02:48:35,870 --> 02:48:37,870
it. But unfortunately

2249
02:48:37,870 --> 02:48:39,870
you're not ever going to see me play Fortnite.

2250
02:48:39,870 --> 02:48:44,340
Sorry to say.

2251
02:48:44,340 --> 02:48:46,340
Why is he in Fortnite?

2252
02:48:46,340 --> 02:48:49,280
Why is John Wick

2253
02:48:49,280 --> 02:48:52,219
in Fortnite? Just wait.

2254
02:48:52,219 --> 02:48:54,219
Mickey Mouse will be in Fortnite

2255
02:48:54,219 --> 02:48:58,059
in six months.

2256
02:48:58,059 --> 02:49:00,059
I'm going to hold on to these because

2257
02:49:00,059 --> 02:49:02,299
at least, yeah, because I want to save for the

2258
02:49:02,299 --> 02:49:05,629
machine gun. But

2259
02:49:05,629 --> 02:49:08,000
should I carry the detonator around

2260
02:49:08,000 --> 02:49:10,000
with me? That's something I don't think I want to

2261
02:49:10,000 --> 02:49:12,940
do. Take the first aid spray.

2262
02:49:12,940 --> 02:49:14,940
The jewel, maybe?

2263
02:49:14,940 --> 02:49:16,940
I don't know. Maybe I'll need it eventually here.

2264
02:49:16,940 --> 02:49:22,579
Nah, it'll be in Fortnite. Or

2265
02:49:22,579 --> 02:49:24,579
like Donald Duck or somebody

2266
02:49:24,579 --> 02:49:28,290
will be in Fortnite.

2267
02:49:28,290 --> 02:49:33,979
Default skin.

2268
02:49:33,979 --> 02:49:38,079
So now let me take a little bit of inventory

2269
02:49:38,079 --> 02:49:40,079
and figure out what the hell I want to do here

2270
02:49:40,079 --> 02:49:42,079
because now I have some options. So

2271
02:49:42,079 --> 02:49:47,459
I got the West office

2272
02:49:47,459 --> 02:49:49,459
is number one

2273
02:49:49,459 --> 02:49:51,819
because I have the key, the code

2274
02:49:51,819 --> 02:49:54,000
to the save. So let's do that right now.

2275
02:49:54,000 --> 02:49:57,579
What was it? 915?

2276
02:49:57,579 --> 02:50:06,100
Something else? 915

2277
02:50:08,100 --> 02:50:13,149
Somebody's in the office.

2278
02:50:13,149 --> 02:50:15,149
I'm going to have to blow this guy's head up with a shotgun, aren't I?

2279
02:50:15,149 --> 02:50:17,149
No, I'm not.

2280
02:50:17,149 --> 02:50:36,700
Shit!

2281
02:50:36,700 --> 02:50:42,139
Are you watching? I hope you're watching.

2282
02:50:52,180 --> 02:50:54,180
I got two on me! Am I dead?

2283
02:50:56,979 --> 02:51:02,610
Nah, I just saved it. Kill me.

2284
02:51:02,610 --> 02:51:06,500
Load game. What?

2285
02:51:06,500 --> 02:51:18,899
Is this one right here? Use the shotgun?

2286
02:51:18,899 --> 02:51:20,899
No, I can't. I need to only use that

2287
02:51:20,899 --> 02:51:32,420
for scary enemies. And save

2288
02:51:32,420 --> 02:51:34,420
scum. Oh, if I have the opportunity to, I have to,

2289
02:51:34,420 --> 02:51:36,420
man!

2290
02:51:36,420 --> 02:51:43,760
Don't get me angry

2291
02:51:43,760 --> 02:51:45,760
in a video game like this. Alright, nine.

2292
02:51:45,760 --> 02:51:50,299
It was left nine, right fifteen.

2293
02:51:50,299 --> 02:51:56,899
Left what?

2294
02:51:56,899 --> 02:51:58,899
Left...

2295
02:51:58,899 --> 02:52:02,159
Don't be fake numbers.

2296
02:52:02,159 --> 02:52:14,500
Four, five, six, seven.

2297
02:52:14,500 --> 02:52:16,500
Guys, it didn't tell me to go to those numbers.

2298
02:52:16,500 --> 02:52:18,500
It told me to turn the dials

2299
02:52:18,500 --> 02:52:20,799
that amount of times.

2300
02:52:20,799 --> 02:52:22,799
Big brain up here.

2301
02:52:22,799 --> 02:52:25,360
Got a big brain up here.

2302
02:52:25,360 --> 02:52:30,739
Nice. Alright, I got that.

2303
02:52:30,739 --> 02:52:32,979
Let's head back to the other room.

2304
02:52:32,979 --> 02:52:36,180
Excuse me.

2305
02:52:36,180 --> 02:52:38,180
It's open now. I'm not sure what else to do

2306
02:52:38,180 --> 02:52:40,180
for after that. Maybe I'll explore

2307
02:52:40,180 --> 02:52:42,180
a place that I haven't gone before.

2308
02:52:42,180 --> 02:52:50,500
Who puts a pouch in a safe?

2309
02:52:50,500 --> 02:52:53,360
Some fucking dummy.

2310
02:52:53,360 --> 02:52:56,559
Okay.

2311
02:52:56,559 --> 02:53:02,190
Open and locks and talking about

2312
02:53:02,190 --> 02:53:04,190
cocks. That's a great...

2313
02:53:04,190 --> 02:53:06,190
Actually, that is a great title for this stream.

2314
02:53:06,190 --> 02:53:13,090
Now, got an extra pouch.

2315
02:53:13,090 --> 02:53:17,489
Sink.

2316
02:53:17,489 --> 02:53:21,200
I do have the detonator.

2317
02:53:21,200 --> 02:53:25,489
Hmm. The detonator was up.

2318
02:53:25,489 --> 02:53:27,489
What room was that in?

2319
02:53:27,489 --> 02:53:30,370
Safe.

2320
02:53:30,370 --> 02:53:32,370
Jack.

2321
02:53:32,370 --> 02:53:36,459
A hundred.

2322
02:53:36,459 --> 02:53:38,639
A hundred dollars.

2323
02:53:38,639 --> 02:53:41,139
Again.

2324
02:53:41,139 --> 02:53:43,139
First, La Cranda.

2325
02:53:43,139 --> 02:53:45,139
Now, G-Bot. H-D-H-F-E.

2326
02:53:45,139 --> 02:53:48,459
Thank you for the hundred dollars.

2327
02:53:48,459 --> 02:53:53,649
Thank you.

2328
02:53:53,649 --> 02:53:55,649
It says, Hey, Jerma, if you got genderbent into a female version of you,

2329
02:53:55,649 --> 02:53:57,649
would you mess with the tallux and seduce him?

2330
02:53:57,649 --> 02:54:01,100
What? What?

2331
02:54:01,100 --> 02:54:08,000
I don't think

2332
02:54:08,000 --> 02:54:10,180
I would do that.

2333
02:54:10,180 --> 02:54:18,620
I wouldn't do that to tallux.

2334
02:54:18,620 --> 02:54:20,620
But thank you so much for the hundred dollars.

2335
02:54:20,620 --> 02:54:26,510
I really appreciate it.

2336
02:54:26,510 --> 02:54:33,809
Imagine giving money to this

2337
02:54:33,809 --> 02:54:36,500
evil man.

2338
02:54:36,500 --> 02:54:47,180
What are you talking about?

2339
02:54:47,180 --> 02:54:51,540
But anyways, I really appreciate the hundred fucking dollars.

2340
02:54:51,540 --> 02:54:55,250
You know what?

2341
02:54:55,250 --> 02:54:57,250
You know what would happen if I...

2342
02:54:57,250 --> 02:55:00,450
I'll give you an answer. If that would have happened,

2343
02:55:00,450 --> 02:55:02,450
I would just be the same person I am right now.

2344
02:55:02,450 --> 02:55:05,889
What would change?

2345
02:55:05,889 --> 02:55:16,940
Not much. Alright, save it.

2346
02:55:16,940 --> 02:55:20,209
Alright, so.

2347
02:55:20,209 --> 02:55:22,379
We're gonna go back to the detonator room.

2348
02:55:22,379 --> 02:55:29,920
Which is up here. Right?

2349
02:55:29,920 --> 02:55:31,920
Combat knife in there. We got

2350
02:55:31,920 --> 02:55:34,420
pirate room.

2351
02:55:34,420 --> 02:55:38,000
Crank handle slot.

2352
02:55:38,000 --> 02:55:40,000
I have not been in this area.

2353
02:55:40,000 --> 02:55:42,000
But I don't know if I can. I need the crank to get up here.

2354
02:55:42,000 --> 02:55:44,000
So I can't really go over here.

2355
02:55:44,000 --> 02:55:47,459
Um.

2356
02:55:47,459 --> 02:55:51,549
I feel like I have to do something with this.

2357
02:55:51,549 --> 02:55:54,049
Or maybe up another floor?

2358
02:55:54,049 --> 02:55:58,340
Dial lock?

2359
02:55:58,340 --> 02:56:01,469
What do I bring the detonator?

2360
02:56:01,469 --> 02:56:03,469
What was that message where the guy was like, I've done it!

2361
02:56:03,469 --> 02:56:05,469
I dropped them away! And I need a battery!

2362
02:56:05,469 --> 02:56:11,729
I don't know. I'm gonna go upstairs.

2363
02:56:11,729 --> 02:56:19,540
That's where I feel like I need to be.

2364
02:56:19,540 --> 02:56:30,139
Shower. Let's go up.

2365
02:56:30,139 --> 02:56:32,639
How we doing on ammo? Good?

2366
02:56:32,639 --> 02:56:34,639
Yes, sir. I have

2367
02:56:34,639 --> 02:56:36,639
lots of ammo. So,

2368
02:56:36,639 --> 02:56:38,639
we gotta go up, up, up, up, up.

2369
02:56:38,639 --> 02:56:41,329
Shut up.

2370
02:56:41,329 --> 02:56:43,329
You're not even fucking funny. You're stupid.

2371
02:56:43,329 --> 02:56:45,329
Nice.

2372
02:56:45,329 --> 02:56:47,329
I deserve it for fucking just trying to make a joke for no reason.

2373
02:56:47,329 --> 02:56:49,329
Just gotta get

2374
02:56:49,329 --> 02:56:51,329
no fucking reason. I don't know what the hell

2375
02:56:51,329 --> 02:56:53,329
that was. Somebody was, I was trying to make a new 2019

2376
02:56:53,329 --> 02:56:55,329
meme.

2377
02:56:55,329 --> 02:56:57,329
I don't know what I was doing. I can't tell you why

2378
02:56:57,329 --> 02:57:00,459
I did that. You gotta be very

2379
02:57:00,459 --> 02:57:02,459
careful in this game. And you can't just do that.

2380
02:57:02,459 --> 02:57:04,459
I don't know what the hell I was doing.

2381
02:57:04,459 --> 02:57:20,129
Alright.

2382
02:57:20,129 --> 02:57:22,129
Where do I put this detonator? It was this room.

2383
02:57:22,129 --> 02:57:25,780
It's dead.

2384
02:57:25,780 --> 02:57:35,870
Right here?

2385
02:57:35,870 --> 02:57:39,389
Right here. Alright, detonator.

2386
02:57:39,389 --> 02:57:42,139
Use. Confirm.

2387
02:57:42,139 --> 02:57:45,090
That's got ten seconds.

2388
02:57:45,090 --> 02:57:52,639
Does the whole room explode? Or just

2389
02:57:52,639 --> 02:58:04,030
That angered somebody.

2390
02:58:04,030 --> 02:58:08,639
Got it. Final medallion.

2391
02:58:08,639 --> 02:58:11,899
Wait, what's on the other side?

2392
02:58:11,899 --> 02:58:21,250
Okay. I just need to look at

2393
02:58:21,250 --> 02:58:23,739
the thing. It is

2394
02:58:23,739 --> 02:58:25,739
face, arrow, snake.

2395
02:58:25,739 --> 02:58:30,030
Face, a

2396
02:58:30,030 --> 02:58:33,940
arrow, snake.

2397
02:58:33,940 --> 02:58:39,309
It's the blind ones. Be quiet.

2398
02:58:39,309 --> 02:58:43,280
That doesn't make any sense.

2399
02:58:43,280 --> 02:58:46,290
Alright, I got them all. Nothing

2400
02:58:46,290 --> 02:58:48,290
else in here. I gotta go right down

2401
02:58:48,290 --> 02:58:54,819
into the main hall. Just one.

2402
02:58:54,819 --> 02:58:56,819
Don't have to worry about it. Don't have to freak out about it.

2403
02:58:56,819 --> 02:59:00,909
Just go straight.

2404
02:59:00,909 --> 02:59:02,909
I can't believe

2405
02:59:02,909 --> 02:59:04,909
that there's

2406
02:59:04,909 --> 02:59:06,909
one of those things in here.

2407
02:59:06,909 --> 02:59:20,659
When I say exit.

2408
02:59:20,659 --> 02:59:25,709
Oh, shotgun. Give me the shotgun.

2409
02:59:25,709 --> 02:59:34,159
Will you fucking die?

2410
02:59:34,159 --> 02:59:36,530
Oh.

2411
02:59:36,530 --> 02:59:38,530
Is it dead? Does it get up?

2412
02:59:38,530 --> 02:59:40,530
It doesn't get up, does it?

2413
02:59:40,530 --> 02:59:48,510
Fuck out of my way. I don't even care.

2414
02:59:48,510 --> 02:59:54,719
I just started the

2415
02:59:54,719 --> 02:59:58,940
I just sang that song from Sia.

2416
02:59:58,940 --> 03:00:05,469
The chandelier one.

2417
03:00:05,469 --> 03:00:08,030
We're not gonna go that way.

2418
03:00:10,030 --> 03:00:22,819
I need this.

2419
03:00:22,819 --> 03:00:24,819
No. Why would you have anything like that in the game?

2420
03:00:24,819 --> 03:00:26,819
Of all the things to have in the game.

2421
03:00:26,819 --> 03:00:32,129
Come on. That's horse shit.

2422
03:00:32,129 --> 03:00:36,420
So we gotta go down

2423
03:00:36,420 --> 03:00:39,620
and then back to the main hall.

2424
03:00:39,620 --> 03:00:46,459
Just go this way, right?

2425
03:00:46,459 --> 03:00:48,459
Main hall is just around the corner and back.

2426
03:00:48,459 --> 03:00:51,659
But where's this combat knife?

2427
03:00:51,659 --> 03:00:56,979
I don't care.

2428
03:00:56,979 --> 03:01:03,440
Save it first

2429
03:01:03,440 --> 03:01:05,440
because something's gonna happen. The boss is gonna drop down

2430
03:01:05,440 --> 03:01:09,340
in the middle of the thing.

2431
03:01:09,340 --> 03:01:11,340
Nemesis is gonna show up and I'm gonna

2432
03:01:11,340 --> 03:01:13,340
scream. You're gonna get a YouTuber scream.

2433
03:01:13,340 --> 03:01:15,340
You already have like five of them.

2434
03:01:15,340 --> 03:01:17,340
And I sang like a YouTuber. Oh my god.

2435
03:01:17,340 --> 03:01:22,209
Something's attacking him. YouTuber sound.

2436
03:01:22,209 --> 03:01:36,979
Alright. Let's put it in.

2437
03:01:36,979 --> 03:01:40,370
He's still alive? He'll get up after this

2438
03:01:40,370 --> 03:01:43,700
and I'll have to shoot him.

2439
03:01:43,700 --> 03:01:45,940
Alright. Put a three in.

2440
03:01:45,940 --> 03:01:47,940
One, two, three. One, two, three.

2441
03:01:47,940 --> 03:01:50,559
One, two, three. One, two, three.

2442
03:01:50,559 --> 03:01:52,559
I can't get it out of my head.

2443
03:01:52,559 --> 03:01:55,059
One, two, three. One, two, three.

2444
03:01:55,059 --> 03:02:03,180
Is he gonna get up?

2445
03:02:03,180 --> 03:02:09,700
I don't think so. He probably will.

2446
03:02:09,700 --> 03:02:20,899
It's gonna be a cutscene right here.

2447
03:02:20,899 --> 03:02:23,069
So it goes underground.

2448
03:02:23,069 --> 03:02:25,500
That's it. That's our way out.

2449
03:02:25,500 --> 03:02:27,500
Lieutenant Branagh!

2450
03:02:27,500 --> 03:02:31,729
Marvin!

2451
03:02:31,729 --> 03:02:34,860
It's time to go.

2452
03:02:34,860 --> 03:02:38,450
We need to get you

2453
03:02:38,450 --> 03:02:40,450
to a hospital right now.

2454
03:02:40,450 --> 03:02:42,450
Hospital? I think that's gonna help.

2455
03:02:42,450 --> 03:02:45,069
Save yourself.

2456
03:02:45,069 --> 03:02:47,069
You need to shoot me.

2457
03:02:47,069 --> 03:02:50,079
Look, we can still make it out of here together.

2458
03:02:50,079 --> 03:02:53,469
It's too late.

2459
03:02:53,469 --> 03:02:57,950
I tried, Leon.

2460
03:02:57,950 --> 03:03:01,280
But I couldn't stop it.

2461
03:03:01,280 --> 03:03:05,120
We can't let this thing spread.

2462
03:03:05,120 --> 03:03:07,870
It's on you now.

2463
03:03:07,870 --> 03:03:11,069
Just go!

2464
03:03:11,069 --> 03:03:18,239
I understand.

2465
03:03:18,239 --> 03:03:28,670
Jerm is crying.

2466
03:03:36,100 --> 03:03:39,040
It won't let you down, Marvin.

2467
03:03:39,040 --> 03:04:06,930
What a fucking actor!

2468
03:04:06,930 --> 03:04:18,260
Gunpowder. Got it.

2469
03:04:18,260 --> 03:04:22,100
This is the new little save point here.

2470
03:04:22,100 --> 03:04:31,360
I need help. Heartless streamer

2471
03:04:31,360 --> 03:04:34,110
tries to make himself cry.

2472
03:04:34,110 --> 03:04:36,110
What you meant to say was

2473
03:04:36,110 --> 03:04:38,110
incredibly talented actor shows his skill

2474
03:04:38,110 --> 03:04:43,809
and craft on stream.

2475
03:04:43,809 --> 03:04:45,809
Nowhere I were in the secret room and there's a T-bar

2476
03:04:45,809 --> 03:04:50,100
handle slot over here.

2477
03:04:50,100 --> 03:04:52,100
I don't have a T-bar. I don't have a bell.

2478
03:04:52,100 --> 03:04:58,819
What about the gem?

2479
03:04:58,819 --> 03:05:00,819
I'm just carrying the gem around still for some reason.

2480
03:05:00,819 --> 03:05:07,459
Let's go.

2481
03:05:07,459 --> 03:05:29,659
Bringing the bell.

2482
03:05:29,659 --> 03:05:42,719
Take out the gun.

2483
03:05:42,719 --> 03:05:53,149
Two ways to go. Let's go down.

2484
03:05:53,149 --> 03:05:57,229
Floor. Hand grenade.

2485
03:05:57,229 --> 03:06:00,239
This is going to kill me.

2486
03:06:00,239 --> 03:06:02,239
This is going to bounce back and hit me in the face.

2487
03:06:02,239 --> 03:06:04,239
Equip on the inventory screen to use.

2488
03:06:04,239 --> 03:06:06,239
Guaranteed to kill enemies within its blast radius.

2489
03:06:06,239 --> 03:06:08,239
Guaranteed to kill its enemies in its blast radius.

2490
03:06:08,239 --> 03:06:11,250
I got a guarantee.

2491
03:06:15,090 --> 03:06:17,649
I can't open that at all.

2492
03:06:17,649 --> 03:06:19,649
I need some type of key or device.

2493
03:06:19,649 --> 03:06:24,959
Nothing else in here.

2494
03:06:24,959 --> 03:06:27,389
Am I still hurt?

2495
03:06:27,389 --> 03:06:29,389
That's my health. Fuck, I am hurt.

2496
03:06:29,389 --> 03:06:37,180
Is this open? No.

2497
03:06:37,180 --> 03:06:39,420
Locked. Back up the stairs.

2498
03:06:39,420 --> 03:06:41,420
Sure.

2499
03:06:41,420 --> 03:06:49,299
Which takes us to...

2500
03:06:49,299 --> 03:06:51,920
This is the only way I can go.

2501
03:06:51,920 --> 03:06:57,870
Somebody up there?

2502
03:06:57,870 --> 03:07:01,200
Somebody's walking up top.

2503
03:07:01,200 --> 03:07:10,860
Boiler room.

2504
03:07:10,860 --> 03:07:12,860
Probably an item somewhere, right?

2505
03:07:12,860 --> 03:07:26,819
Machinery room.

2506
03:07:26,819 --> 03:07:29,250
Only one way to go.

2507
03:07:31,250 --> 03:07:41,860
Me?

2508
03:07:41,860 --> 03:07:49,790
That's me!

2509
03:07:49,790 --> 03:07:51,790
They took me and this is my DNA.

2510
03:07:51,790 --> 03:07:56,459
Where the fuck are we going?

2511
03:07:56,459 --> 03:08:03,250
Oh well, now it wants to go.

2512
03:08:03,250 --> 03:08:05,250
It wants me to go.

2513
03:08:05,250 --> 03:08:08,260
You gotta...

2514
03:08:08,260 --> 03:08:10,260
Where the fuck?

2515
03:08:10,260 --> 03:08:14,989
Boss? I'm finding a boss.

2516
03:08:14,989 --> 03:08:23,120
Are you going to give me a red herb right now?

2517
03:08:23,120 --> 03:08:27,090
I need healing.

2518
03:08:27,090 --> 03:08:29,329
What is this? Box?

2519
03:08:29,329 --> 03:08:31,329
Oh shit, what do I do about this?

2520
03:08:31,329 --> 03:08:33,329
What do I do? What do I do?

2521
03:08:33,329 --> 03:08:42,030
What do I do? What do I do?

2522
03:08:42,030 --> 03:08:44,030
Steam? I have to blast him with steam in the face.

2523
03:08:44,030 --> 03:08:57,979
Guaranteed grenade.

2524
03:08:57,979 --> 03:09:07,760
Blast him with steam.

2525
03:09:07,760 --> 03:09:10,579
Blast him with steam.

2526
03:09:10,579 --> 03:09:12,579
There's got to be something I can do to blast him, right?

2527
03:09:12,579 --> 03:09:21,780
Nothing to blast him.

2528
03:09:21,780 --> 03:09:30,930
I'll give you a blast.

2529
03:09:30,930 --> 03:09:37,020
You have a gun. I know, but I just want to see if there's an environmental blast.

2530
03:09:37,020 --> 03:09:39,020
Should I just combine these two? I'm not going to use the heal.

2531
03:09:39,020 --> 03:09:45,739
Just do it. Fuck it. Do it.

2532
03:09:45,739 --> 03:09:48,180
Don't heal. Not going to use it. Don't need it.

2533
03:09:48,180 --> 03:10:07,360
Where is he?

2534
03:10:07,360 --> 03:10:10,750
I see. I see. Right there.

2535
03:10:10,750 --> 03:10:15,489
Oh shit, I didn't see it.

2536
03:10:15,489 --> 03:10:17,489
No, he's got an eye. He's got an eye right there.

2537
03:10:45,760 --> 03:11:03,659
Oh fuck!

2538
03:11:11,229 --> 03:11:13,229
What? Show me the eye.

2539
03:11:13,229 --> 03:11:16,180
Where's the fucking eye?

2540
03:11:16,180 --> 03:11:29,870
Where's the eye?

2541
03:11:29,870 --> 03:12:11,659
Do you even eye up your ass or something? I don't get it.

2542
03:12:11,659 --> 03:12:13,659
Oh shit, where am I going?

2543
03:12:13,659 --> 03:12:16,350
I turned around twice.

2544
03:12:16,350 --> 03:12:18,350
I'm dead. See you later.

2545
03:12:18,350 --> 03:12:20,530
Goodbye.

2546
03:12:20,530 --> 03:12:24,879
Now I play as him. That was scripted.

2547
03:12:24,879 --> 03:12:29,729
Okay, so eye opens up.

2548
03:12:29,729 --> 03:12:33,040
Shoot eye and run away.

2549
03:12:33,040 --> 03:12:35,469
And then just kill guy.

2550
03:12:35,469 --> 03:12:39,629
Shoot eye.

2551
03:12:39,629 --> 03:12:42,319
Okay.

2552
03:12:42,319 --> 03:12:44,620
I probably should get the first aid, but we'll see.

2553
03:12:44,620 --> 03:12:46,620
Use grenade. Yeah, I understand.

2554
03:12:46,620 --> 03:12:52,879
Can't go through there.

2555
03:12:52,879 --> 03:12:54,879
Just unlocking it.

2556
03:12:54,879 --> 03:13:06,059
I'm going to save again.

2557
03:13:06,059 --> 03:13:08,059
Should I just go back up?

2558
03:13:08,059 --> 03:13:12,719
Let me see.

2559
03:13:12,719 --> 03:13:21,489
Oh shit.

2560
03:13:21,489 --> 03:13:23,489
Should I just go back up?

2561
03:13:23,489 --> 03:13:25,489
Let me see. Did I not bring the other...

2562
03:13:25,489 --> 03:13:27,489
I thought I had one more first aid spray.

2563
03:13:27,489 --> 03:13:29,920
Apparently not.

2564
03:13:29,920 --> 03:13:33,379
I gotta go now.

2565
03:13:33,379 --> 03:13:35,379
Just beat him. It's not going to be a problem.

2566
03:13:35,379 --> 03:13:39,780
Just fucking beat him.

2567
03:13:39,780 --> 03:13:49,700
I'm good.

2568
03:13:49,700 --> 03:13:54,819
Fuck, now I get some other way.

2569
03:13:54,819 --> 03:13:58,079
Left eye, middle eye, right eye, fire.

2570
03:13:58,079 --> 03:14:01,340
At least now I know what to do.

2571
03:14:01,340 --> 03:14:03,340
Alright, area, walk along.

2572
03:14:03,340 --> 03:14:08,979
It really is nemesis.

2573
03:14:08,979 --> 03:14:10,979
Just don't waste shots on him for no reason.

2574
03:14:10,979 --> 03:14:14,370
I don't even have an opportunity to shoot.

2575
03:14:14,370 --> 03:14:19,360
Alright, here we go.

2576
03:14:19,360 --> 03:14:21,360
FurtBernanda has 20 community subs.

2577
03:14:21,360 --> 03:14:23,360
Thank you so much Furt.

2578
03:14:23,360 --> 03:14:26,110
That's a shitload.

2579
03:14:26,110 --> 03:14:28,989
That is an absolute shitload of subs.

2580
03:14:28,989 --> 03:14:36,159
Thank you.

2581
03:14:36,159 --> 03:14:38,159
Always shoot in her mouth.

2582
03:14:38,159 --> 03:14:41,549
Not in this game.

2583
03:14:41,549 --> 03:14:43,979
Alright, let's do it.

2584
03:14:43,979 --> 03:14:46,290
Thank you so much Furt.

2585
03:14:46,290 --> 03:14:48,290
Congratulations to all the community subs.

2586
03:14:48,290 --> 03:14:52,620
I tell you.

2587
03:14:52,620 --> 03:14:54,620
Alright, shoot eye.

2588
03:14:54,620 --> 03:14:56,620
Not yet.

2589
03:14:56,620 --> 03:14:58,620
There's a heal right behind me.

2590
03:14:58,620 --> 03:15:00,799
Let's go get the heal.

2591
03:15:00,799 --> 03:15:08,459
Right here.

2592
03:15:08,459 --> 03:15:10,459
This is not a heal, but...

2593
03:15:10,459 --> 03:15:15,969
Which way are you going?

2594
03:15:15,969 --> 03:15:19,229
Alright, which way is he? I don't know which way he is.

2595
03:15:19,229 --> 03:15:28,379
And go, take it, use it.

2596
03:15:28,379 --> 03:15:36,260
Where you at?

2597
03:15:36,260 --> 03:15:46,030
I know how to combine, yes.

2598
03:15:46,030 --> 03:15:48,030
Alright, where the hell did you go?

2599
03:15:48,030 --> 03:15:50,850
Is he up top? Where the fuck is he?

2600
03:15:50,850 --> 03:16:02,879
That eye ain't opened yet.

2601
03:16:02,879 --> 03:16:09,840
What's it going to take?

2602
03:16:09,840 --> 03:16:14,190
Open your eye.

2603
03:16:14,190 --> 03:16:34,350
Open that eye.

2604
03:16:34,350 --> 03:16:36,350
Don't crush my head again.

2605
03:16:36,350 --> 03:16:53,760
You gotta wait for the second swing.

2606
03:16:53,760 --> 03:16:55,760
He swings twice.

2607
03:16:55,760 --> 03:17:02,590
Get the heal.

2608
03:17:02,590 --> 03:17:05,020
Come on.

2609
03:17:05,020 --> 03:17:07,020
I'm dead.

2610
03:17:07,020 --> 03:17:09,260
Am I dead here?

2611
03:17:33,040 --> 03:17:36,299
Steam. I didn't do that.

2612
03:17:36,299 --> 03:17:45,520
Blast him right here, right?

2613
03:17:45,520 --> 03:17:47,520
What's going on?

2614
03:17:47,520 --> 03:17:49,520
Is he getting steamed?

2615
03:17:49,520 --> 03:18:06,610
Wow.

2616
03:18:06,610 --> 03:18:13,379
Where's the eye?

2617
03:18:13,379 --> 03:18:16,639
Oh shit, that's a wall behind me.

2618
03:18:16,639 --> 03:18:18,639
Oh my god, why is he doing this to me?

2619
03:18:18,639 --> 03:18:20,940
He's running so fast.

2620
03:18:20,940 --> 03:18:28,500
Open your eye.

2621
03:18:34,770 --> 03:18:36,770
Goodbye.

2622
03:18:36,770 --> 03:18:49,170
Which way did he go?

2623
03:18:49,170 --> 03:18:57,100
Is he smart? Is he going to like,

2624
03:18:57,100 --> 03:19:00,049
wrap around this way?

2625
03:19:07,200 --> 03:19:17,100
He's going...

2626
03:19:17,100 --> 03:19:19,100
Don't go that way.

2627
03:19:26,770 --> 03:19:35,090
Don't get stuck here.

2628
03:19:35,090 --> 03:19:37,090
Are we getting even more steam in here?

2629
03:19:37,090 --> 03:19:39,709
Oh fuck.

2630
03:19:48,850 --> 03:19:54,139
Jeremy!

2631
03:19:54,139 --> 03:20:19,020
We're going to transform.

2632
03:20:21,020 --> 03:20:30,100
That was pretty cool.

2633
03:20:30,100 --> 03:20:34,319
That was fun. Phase two.

2634
03:20:34,319 --> 03:20:40,379
Somebody's watching me.

2635
03:20:40,379 --> 03:20:42,379
Wait, hold on. Let me make sure I didn't

2636
03:20:42,379 --> 03:20:44,379
leave anything here. I did.

2637
03:20:44,379 --> 03:20:47,389
In the corner there is a grenade.

2638
03:20:47,389 --> 03:20:52,500
But it didn't pick up.

2639
03:20:52,500 --> 03:21:00,989
Right there.

2640
03:21:00,989 --> 03:21:03,809
Let's reload the guns.

2641
03:21:03,809 --> 03:21:05,809
I got plenty of ammo left.

2642
03:21:05,809 --> 03:21:19,360
That's good.

2643
03:21:19,360 --> 03:21:23,069
Very cool.

2644
03:21:23,069 --> 03:21:29,899
Gunpowder.

2645
03:21:29,899 --> 03:21:35,729
Looks like a whole lot of nothing.

2646
03:21:35,729 --> 03:21:38,290
What's my health at right now?

2647
03:21:38,290 --> 03:21:41,870
Fine. Jeremy smells like Minecraft Steve.

2648
03:21:41,870 --> 03:21:46,479
I don't know what that means.

2649
03:21:46,479 --> 03:21:56,020
Like a piece of plastic?

2650
03:21:56,020 --> 03:21:58,260
Like a brick?

2651
03:21:58,260 --> 03:22:06,450
Minecraft Steve's not going to prison.

2652
03:22:06,450 --> 03:22:08,450
All the people in Minecraft that made out of blocks and shit, right?

2653
03:22:08,450 --> 03:22:14,020
Is he going to make a bridge to go across?

2654
03:22:21,500 --> 03:22:25,219
Minecraft Steve is more real than you.

2655
03:22:25,219 --> 03:22:27,219
What?

2656
03:22:27,219 --> 03:22:31,629
Minecraft Steve is made out of clay.

2657
03:22:31,629 --> 03:22:33,629
He's made out of dirt blocks.

2658
03:22:33,629 --> 03:22:44,180
So are you.

2659
03:22:44,180 --> 03:22:51,149
Yeah?

2660
03:22:51,149 --> 03:22:53,149
Have you ever seen somebody with this much like stretchy neck skin before?

2661
03:22:53,149 --> 03:23:00,059
When I'm like 60 I'm going to have to get that

2662
03:23:00,059 --> 03:23:10,370
taken care of.

2663
03:23:10,370 --> 03:23:14,719
Okay. Let's see. I have a lot of red herbs.

2664
03:23:14,719 --> 03:23:16,719
I feel like I'm going to need them for poison later.

2665
03:23:16,719 --> 03:23:24,850
Keep this in the inventory.

2666
03:23:24,850 --> 03:23:28,559
That looks good.

2667
03:23:28,559 --> 03:23:31,700
What about, take the boards.

2668
03:23:31,700 --> 03:23:35,899
I feel like I'm going to need them.

2669
03:23:35,899 --> 03:23:37,899
He doesn't know what red herbs do.

2670
03:23:37,899 --> 03:23:40,079
Yes I do. It's poison.

2671
03:23:40,079 --> 03:23:42,319
Red and green is anti-poison.

2672
03:23:42,319 --> 03:23:44,319
Red and blue is constitution.

2673
03:23:44,319 --> 03:23:46,319
Which I have no idea what that does.

2674
03:23:46,319 --> 03:23:48,319
That's not what it does.

2675
03:23:48,319 --> 03:23:53,170
That's incorrect.

2676
03:23:53,170 --> 03:23:56,299
Are you sure?

2677
03:23:56,299 --> 03:23:58,299
Do you have the game manual in front of you?

2678
03:23:58,299 --> 03:24:25,739
Because I don't.

2679
03:24:25,739 --> 03:24:30,219
Blue is poison.

2680
03:24:30,219 --> 03:24:35,069
Nice. Another pouch.

2681
03:24:35,069 --> 03:24:37,069
This just makes the game so much better.

2682
03:24:37,069 --> 03:24:41,940
Streamer admits he was wrong.

2683
03:24:41,940 --> 03:24:43,940
I will admit when I'm wrong.

2684
03:24:43,940 --> 03:24:46,110
Of course I will.

2685
03:24:46,110 --> 03:24:48,110
Can somebody with this much neck skin tell you

2686
03:24:48,110 --> 03:24:50,110
be right all the time?

2687
03:24:50,110 --> 03:24:59,819
No.

2688
03:24:59,819 --> 03:25:03,219
That means I can take, I'll take the jewel.

2689
03:25:03,219 --> 03:25:09,600
Okay.

2690
03:25:09,600 --> 03:25:16,190
You know that I'm a reptilian.

2691
03:25:19,899 --> 03:25:21,899
I watched his eyes during the stream

2692
03:25:21,899 --> 03:25:25,360
and they were going like this.

2693
03:25:25,360 --> 03:25:28,370
And they turned green for a second.

2694
03:25:28,370 --> 03:25:42,879
See Leon's eyes there?

2695
03:25:42,879 --> 03:25:44,879
They went like...

2696
03:25:44,879 --> 03:26:01,229
Parking garage.

2697
03:26:01,229 --> 03:26:04,620
So three and a half hours ago

2698
03:26:04,620 --> 03:26:06,620
I was going to save this.

2699
03:26:06,620 --> 03:26:08,620
And we had internet problems

2700
03:26:08,620 --> 03:26:10,620
and we seem to be okay now.

2701
03:26:10,620 --> 03:26:12,620
So the thing I was going to say back when I was like

2702
03:26:12,620 --> 03:26:14,620
I want to make this, I've got something I've got to say.

2703
03:26:14,620 --> 03:26:16,620
So in the original game there was an NPC

2704
03:26:16,620 --> 03:26:18,620
who was the gun store owner.

2705
03:26:18,620 --> 03:26:20,860
And I was really...

2706
03:26:20,860 --> 03:26:24,450
Did they omit that from the game?

2707
03:26:24,450 --> 03:26:26,450
Because he was my favorite NPC of the game.

2708
03:26:26,450 --> 03:26:29,780
The guy that goes, who are you?

2709
03:26:29,780 --> 03:26:32,139
And what are you doing here?

2710
03:26:32,139 --> 03:26:34,139
It better be the same voice actor.

2711
03:26:34,139 --> 03:26:36,139
They better have just taken that same audio file and put it over him.

2712
03:26:36,139 --> 03:26:40,219
That's in Claire's campaign?

2713
03:26:40,219 --> 03:26:46,030
Oh, that's too bad.

2714
03:26:46,030 --> 03:26:48,030
I think I'm going to restart the game in place Claire.

2715
03:26:48,030 --> 03:26:53,149
Alright, big open space.

2716
03:26:53,149 --> 03:26:55,149
There's probably going to be something that jumps out here.

2717
03:26:55,149 --> 03:27:01,299
This door looks locked.

2718
03:27:01,299 --> 03:27:03,299
And it is.

2719
03:27:03,299 --> 03:27:24,590
Don't go too fast.

2720
03:27:24,590 --> 03:27:31,440
Probably a liquor or something.

2721
03:27:31,440 --> 03:27:33,440
The guy in the trash? No.

2722
03:27:33,440 --> 03:27:39,520
Item in the trash? No.

2723
03:27:39,520 --> 03:27:41,520
There's two more doors. That door's locked.

2724
03:27:41,520 --> 03:27:47,459
They're all locked.

2725
03:27:47,459 --> 03:27:52,899
Okay. Hmm.

2726
03:27:52,899 --> 03:28:04,020
All of them are locked.

2727
03:28:04,020 --> 03:28:07,790
Fuse box? No.

2728
03:28:07,790 --> 03:28:11,700
Parking garage ticket? I don't have one.

2729
03:28:11,700 --> 03:28:14,620
Cut scene.

2730
03:28:14,620 --> 03:28:35,620
Boom!

2731
03:28:35,620 --> 03:28:37,620
Bob's face is going to get blown up right here.

2732
03:28:37,620 --> 03:28:39,620
From the trailer. Thank you very much.

2733
03:28:39,620 --> 03:28:43,709
Hey! Who is that?

2734
03:28:43,709 --> 03:28:47,340
Stay sharp.

2735
03:28:47,340 --> 03:28:55,329
Who is it? Ada!

2736
03:28:55,329 --> 03:28:57,500
Yep. Oh yeah.

2737
03:28:57,500 --> 03:29:01,469
FBI. Sorry.

2738
03:29:01,469 --> 03:29:06,000
Thank you. For your help.

2739
03:29:06,000 --> 03:29:11,180
I'm surprised you made it this far.

2740
03:29:11,180 --> 03:29:14,700
FBI, huh? What's going on here?

2741
03:29:14,700 --> 03:29:16,700
Sorry. That information's classified.

2742
03:29:16,700 --> 03:29:18,700
Where you going?

2743
03:29:18,700 --> 03:29:22,670
Do yourself a favor.

2744
03:29:22,670 --> 03:29:24,909
Stop asking questions and get the hell out of here.

2745
03:29:24,909 --> 03:29:30,100
I'm too appreciated to emotes.

2746
03:29:30,100 --> 03:29:32,100
Saturn?

2747
03:29:32,100 --> 03:29:34,659
Oh, by the way.

2748
03:29:34,659 --> 03:29:36,959
Just wanted to let everybody know because

2749
03:29:36,959 --> 03:29:38,959
there's people here, right?

2750
03:29:38,959 --> 03:29:41,440
The

2751
03:29:41,440 --> 03:29:43,440
t-shirts that I've been talking about. Remember I told you that

2752
03:29:43,440 --> 03:29:45,440
before January was over

2753
03:29:45,440 --> 03:29:48,510
the shirts are going up tomorrow.

2754
03:29:48,510 --> 03:29:50,750
So the shirts will be launching

2755
03:29:50,750 --> 03:29:52,750
if not tomorrow then Wednesday. I'm going to try to get it to work.

2756
03:29:52,750 --> 03:29:54,750
Try to launch the t-shirts.

2757
03:29:54,750 --> 03:29:57,309
Two of them. Glue Man's

2758
03:29:57,309 --> 03:29:59,309
coming back. And the solar system.

2759
03:29:59,309 --> 03:30:02,000
Because somebody brought up the solar system.

2760
03:30:02,000 --> 03:30:04,000
So that's going to happen tomorrow or Wednesday.

2761
03:30:04,000 --> 03:30:06,000
I've not figured it out yet. Make sure I get it

2762
03:30:06,000 --> 03:30:08,500
ready to go. But yeah.

2763
03:30:08,500 --> 03:30:10,500
And they will be there permanently.

2764
03:30:10,500 --> 03:30:12,500
So no more

2765
03:30:12,500 --> 03:30:14,500
three week campaigns.

2766
03:30:14,500 --> 03:30:17,569
And the Glue Man shirt is going to be in like

2767
03:30:17,569 --> 03:30:20,319
three colors. Get it if you

2768
03:30:20,319 --> 03:30:23,649
feel like it whenever you want. How much money

2769
03:30:23,649 --> 03:30:25,889
for a shirt? 20 bucks.

2770
03:30:25,889 --> 03:30:28,510
Or like, yeah.

2771
03:30:28,510 --> 03:30:31,649
Probably 20 bucks. Because I think

2772
03:30:31,649 --> 03:30:33,649
there's like different... I was

2773
03:30:33,649 --> 03:30:35,649
trying to talk to somebody at Teespring because

2774
03:30:35,649 --> 03:30:38,340
three years

2775
03:30:38,340 --> 03:30:40,340
ago when I made the shirt the first time.

2776
03:30:40,340 --> 03:30:42,959
It was... There's different like t-shirt

2777
03:30:42,959 --> 03:30:44,959
material. You can do like premium shirts

2778
03:30:44,959 --> 03:30:46,959
that cost more. I don't know. I

2779
03:30:46,959 --> 03:30:48,959
have to like look into that. But it probably

2780
03:30:48,959 --> 03:30:50,959
will not be more than 20 dollars.

2781
03:30:50,959 --> 03:30:52,959
For sure. So. There you go.

2782
03:30:52,959 --> 03:30:56,350
Do I accept what

2783
03:30:56,350 --> 03:30:58,350
coins? I don't know what that means.

2784
03:30:58,350 --> 03:31:02,959
Nah. A shirt on this channel

2785
03:31:02,959 --> 03:31:04,959
would never be more than like 22 to 25

2786
03:31:04,959 --> 03:31:06,959
dollars. But I'm not going to need to do that.

2787
03:31:06,959 --> 03:31:08,959
It'll be 20 bucks. For sure.

2788
03:31:08,959 --> 03:31:11,899
So where am I going?

2789
03:31:11,899 --> 03:31:15,100
Well, hold on. This door opened. Both doors

2790
03:31:15,100 --> 03:31:17,100
just opened. I could follow...

2791
03:31:17,100 --> 03:31:19,100
I'll follow her out. See where...

2792
03:31:19,100 --> 03:31:22,559
Whatever. Let's go this way. He's already

2793
03:31:22,559 --> 03:31:25,440
raising the prices! I just said

2794
03:31:25,440 --> 03:31:33,889
20 bucks. Okay. This opens that.

2795
03:31:33,889 --> 03:31:36,450
Which brings me to the

2796
03:31:36,450 --> 03:31:38,450
jail. Okay. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.

2797
03:31:38,450 --> 03:31:44,020
Police station B1 map.

2798
03:31:44,020 --> 03:31:49,950
Nice. A lot of bullets.

2799
03:31:55,200 --> 03:32:01,659
Oh. Minimum bit... Oh, I see what you're saying.

2800
03:32:01,659 --> 03:32:04,139
No.

2801
03:32:04,139 --> 03:32:06,379
We talked about it why. We talked about

2802
03:32:06,379 --> 03:32:11,819
why before. Don't just...

2803
03:32:11,819 --> 03:32:14,700
Wait. Go save the game. Can I get

2804
03:32:14,700 --> 03:32:16,700
like a save point in the jail somewhere?

2805
03:32:16,700 --> 03:32:23,680
You're going to break this open.

2806
03:32:23,680 --> 03:32:25,860
I know you are. Should I just

2807
03:32:25,860 --> 03:32:36,100
take care of it? They're all

2808
03:32:36,100 --> 03:32:38,850
going to open. Just watch.

2809
03:32:38,850 --> 03:32:45,629
All these damn things are going to open.

2810
03:32:45,629 --> 03:33:04,639
That's going to open

2811
03:33:04,639 --> 03:33:06,639
them. So I need to have an escape

2812
03:33:06,639 --> 03:33:09,329
route here. Doesn't look like

2813
03:33:09,329 --> 03:33:11,329
there's any items in any of these cells.

2814
03:33:11,329 --> 03:33:14,020
NPC.

2815
03:33:18,020 --> 03:33:21,219
Hello, human. You've been here long?

2816
03:33:21,219 --> 03:33:23,459
Long enough. Are we

2817
03:33:23,459 --> 03:33:25,459
the last ones alive? No. No.

2818
03:33:25,459 --> 03:33:27,459
There's a few of us. That's good news

2819
03:33:27,459 --> 03:33:29,459
I guess. Yeah. That's of course Irons

2820
03:33:29,459 --> 03:33:31,459
sent you. Irons. You mean Chief Irons.

2821
03:33:31,459 --> 03:33:33,459
Is he still around? Who cares?

2822
03:33:33,459 --> 03:33:35,459
Hopefully he's somebody's dinner by now.

2823
03:33:35,459 --> 03:33:37,459
What do you mean by that? He's the bastard

2824
03:33:37,459 --> 03:33:39,459
that locked me in here. I'm sure

2825
03:33:39,459 --> 03:33:41,459
he had a good reason. He did.

2826
03:33:41,459 --> 03:33:45,360
I was about to blow

2827
03:33:45,360 --> 03:33:47,360
the whistle on his dirty ass. He has a full cigarette.

2828
03:33:47,360 --> 03:33:49,360
I added the same thing to him I guess.

2829
03:33:49,360 --> 03:33:51,729
Just took one hall and threw it in the trash?

2830
03:33:51,729 --> 03:33:56,079
On the ground? I'll make you a

2831
03:33:56,079 --> 03:33:58,079
deal. I'll lock this cell and I'll

2832
03:33:58,079 --> 03:34:00,079
give you this. Okay. There's no other way out of that parking

2833
03:34:00,079 --> 03:34:02,079
garage. Believe me. Sorry.

2834
03:34:02,079 --> 03:34:04,079
I can't do that. I have to talk

2835
03:34:04,079 --> 03:34:06,079
to the Chief first.

2836
03:34:06,079 --> 03:34:08,750
Look. We're both prisoners in this station.

2837
03:34:08,750 --> 03:34:10,750
I'll do it. So we can play nice

2838
03:34:10,750 --> 03:34:12,750
and help each other out.

2839
03:34:12,750 --> 03:34:14,750
Shit. It's coming.

2840
03:34:14,750 --> 03:34:16,750
What's coming? What's coming?

2841
03:34:16,750 --> 03:34:18,750
Come on. Come on. Don't be an asshole.

2842
03:34:18,750 --> 03:34:20,750
You need this.

2843
03:34:20,750 --> 03:34:22,750
Just get me the fuck out of here!

2844
03:34:28,750 --> 03:34:38,420
Oh, what is that? I just did a

2845
03:34:38,420 --> 03:34:41,100
boss. I just did

2846
03:34:41,100 --> 03:34:43,920
a boss. Who is that?

2847
03:34:43,920 --> 03:34:45,920
It was Ada!

2848
03:34:45,920 --> 03:34:47,920
Sorry. She's got the same

2849
03:34:47,920 --> 03:34:50,100
glove.

2850
03:34:50,100 --> 03:34:52,100
Ada, you got superpowers, huh?

2851
03:34:52,100 --> 03:34:54,100
Yeah, sometimes I get literally fucking mad and I

2852
03:34:54,100 --> 03:34:56,100
turn green. I get huge.

2853
03:34:56,100 --> 03:34:58,100
Just don't make me pissed off.

2854
03:35:01,729 --> 03:35:04,540
I don't have breakfast this morning.

2855
03:35:04,540 --> 03:35:06,540
Hey, you can't keep walking away from me.

2856
03:35:06,540 --> 03:35:08,540
I don't even know your name.

2857
03:35:08,540 --> 03:35:11,420
I'm Leon Kennedy.

2858
03:35:11,420 --> 03:35:14,180
No.

2859
03:35:14,180 --> 03:35:17,569
Find a way out, Leon,

2860
03:35:17,569 --> 03:35:22,299
before it's too late.

2861
03:35:22,299 --> 03:35:24,299
You're really gonna give me your full hand there.

2862
03:35:24,299 --> 03:35:26,930
Just say my name is L.

2863
03:35:26,930 --> 03:35:28,930
Name's Ada.

2864
03:35:28,930 --> 03:35:30,930
Okay, that's a start.

2865
03:35:30,930 --> 03:35:32,930
You give him one letter first and then you say I'll give you the

2866
03:35:32,930 --> 03:35:34,930
next letter when I see you again if you give me your first

2867
03:35:34,930 --> 03:35:36,930
letter. Well, I guess the deal's on.

2868
03:35:36,930 --> 03:35:38,930
All right, that's the

2869
03:35:38,930 --> 03:35:45,260
world. Pull the lever and

2870
03:35:45,260 --> 03:35:49,170
I'm home. Before I do that, let me make sure I don't miss

2871
03:35:49,170 --> 03:35:51,170
any items because they're all gonna open and I gotta

2872
03:35:51,170 --> 03:35:53,170
find out. I gotta get a perfect escape route.

2873
03:35:53,170 --> 03:35:55,170
So

2874
03:35:55,170 --> 03:35:57,659
that's the key

2875
03:35:57,659 --> 03:35:59,659
card to the parking garage,

2876
03:35:59,659 --> 03:36:04,209
which means I just gotta go right out the door

2877
03:36:04,209 --> 03:36:06,209
after pulling this.

2878
03:36:06,209 --> 03:36:08,450
So I gotta be prepared. I'm ready.

2879
03:36:08,450 --> 03:36:10,450
I'm ready. I'm ready. There's a

2880
03:36:10,450 --> 03:36:13,840
tool. It's like a crank.

2881
03:36:13,840 --> 03:36:15,840
I know where that goes.

2882
03:36:15,840 --> 03:36:17,840
Jail power panel.

2883
03:36:17,840 --> 03:36:19,840
I assume everyone knows, but since

2884
03:36:19,840 --> 03:36:21,840
the jail's power panel is old as hell,

2885
03:36:21,840 --> 03:36:23,840
we're gonna need those custom power panel parts

2886
03:36:23,840 --> 03:36:25,840
no one makes anymore.

2887
03:36:25,840 --> 03:36:27,840
There should be a few in the generator room.

2888
03:36:27,840 --> 03:36:33,149
There's only one of those power panel parts in the

2889
03:36:33,149 --> 03:36:35,459
generator room. The guy that's here to fix

2890
03:36:35,459 --> 03:36:37,459
the bell in the clock tower should have another.

2891
03:36:37,459 --> 03:36:39,459
So someone swipe, I mean ask nicely

2892
03:36:39,459 --> 03:36:50,399
for it please. So I have an unfortunate

2893
03:36:50,399 --> 03:36:53,979
thing to say. And it's actually

2894
03:36:53,979 --> 03:36:55,979
kind of, this really like sucks actually.

2895
03:36:55,979 --> 03:37:00,059
Remember a couple

2896
03:37:00,059 --> 03:37:02,059
days ago when I thought I was getting like a migraine?

2897
03:37:02,059 --> 03:37:07,379
And it's

2898
03:37:07,379 --> 03:37:11,659
happening again.

2899
03:37:11,659 --> 03:37:20,219
Wait, why is

2900
03:37:20,219 --> 03:37:22,219
this not open? I just did the power.

2901
03:37:22,219 --> 03:37:27,219
Does that not do anything?

2902
03:37:27,219 --> 03:37:32,450
Oh, okay.

2903
03:37:32,450 --> 03:37:37,760
Sometimes the

2904
03:37:37,760 --> 03:37:39,760
unfortunate truth about this is

2905
03:37:39,760 --> 03:37:41,760
sometimes I get like a string of headaches

2906
03:37:41,760 --> 03:37:44,190
and a string of like migraines

2907
03:37:44,190 --> 03:37:46,190
and then I'm fine. For like

2908
03:37:46,190 --> 03:37:48,190
another, like after a few days.

2909
03:37:48,190 --> 03:37:50,430
I have seen a doctor about it,

2910
03:37:50,430 --> 03:37:52,430
don't worry. But it's

2911
03:37:52,430 --> 03:37:56,079
kind of happening again.

2912
03:37:56,079 --> 03:38:01,389
Unfortunately. I get like a string

2913
03:38:01,389 --> 03:38:03,389
of like five, four or five days in a row where I'm

2914
03:38:03,389 --> 03:38:06,530
just really fucked up. But

2915
03:38:06,530 --> 03:38:08,959
I'm alright right now. But the

2916
03:38:08,959 --> 03:38:10,959
stream may have to do another one of those

2917
03:38:10,959 --> 03:38:13,260
ending before I want to.

2918
03:38:13,260 --> 03:38:16,209
But what can

2919
03:38:16,209 --> 03:38:18,700
you do, right? Electronic door

2920
03:38:18,700 --> 03:38:20,700
panel, it's that thing right there.

2921
03:38:20,700 --> 03:38:22,700
I can't use it. Let me look at that thing again.

2922
03:38:22,700 --> 03:38:26,540
Alright.

2923
03:38:26,540 --> 03:38:29,040
I'm gonna need those custom power panel parts.

2924
03:38:29,040 --> 03:38:32,370
Yeah, I've been sleeping fine.

2925
03:38:32,370 --> 03:38:39,219
Just taking aspirin.

2926
03:38:39,219 --> 03:38:42,780
Nah, I'll be good. Don't worry.

2927
03:38:42,780 --> 03:38:44,780
There should be a few in the, I gotta go to the generator room.

2928
03:38:44,780 --> 03:38:48,299
I got word that there's only one of those

2929
03:38:48,299 --> 03:38:50,299
power panel parts in the generator room. The guy that

2930
03:38:50,299 --> 03:38:52,299
the bell, the guy that's here to

2931
03:38:52,299 --> 03:38:54,299
fix the bell in the clock tower should have another.

2932
03:38:54,299 --> 03:38:56,299
So clock tower and then generator

2933
03:38:56,299 --> 03:38:58,610
room. Let's see what that is.

2934
03:38:58,610 --> 03:39:01,940
Generator room.

2935
03:39:01,940 --> 03:39:04,620
So we have to go out this way.

2936
03:39:04,620 --> 03:39:06,620
So back to the garage.

2937
03:39:06,620 --> 03:39:10,579
Get some, I've been drinking water.

2938
03:39:10,579 --> 03:39:12,579
I mean, I made the joke how I wouldn't get coffee again, but when I was downstairs

2939
03:39:12,579 --> 03:39:14,579
I had a full glass of water. So that's,

2940
03:39:14,579 --> 03:39:16,579
I don't think it's that.

2941
03:39:16,579 --> 03:39:24,500
But, yeah.

2942
03:39:24,500 --> 03:39:26,670
If I do end up stopping

2943
03:39:26,670 --> 03:39:28,670
prematurely, then

2944
03:39:28,670 --> 03:39:30,670
we will try it again tomorrow. We'll do it again tomorrow.

2945
03:39:30,670 --> 03:39:35,149
Okay, so

2946
03:39:35,149 --> 03:39:37,149
what other door, this door opened over here.

2947
03:39:37,149 --> 03:39:42,020
Make sure you have good posture.

2948
03:39:42,020 --> 03:39:45,659
Nah, I'm good. I'm good.

2949
03:39:45,659 --> 03:39:47,659
You're supposed to drink four gallons of water

2950
03:39:47,659 --> 03:39:51,120
a day.

2951
03:39:51,120 --> 03:39:53,120
That is not sound medical advice.

2952
03:39:53,120 --> 03:39:55,120
I will tell you.

2953
03:39:55,120 --> 03:39:58,639
It's a stray generator room. We can go up

2954
03:39:58,639 --> 03:40:00,639
here. Oh, no.

2955
03:40:00,639 --> 03:40:02,639
It gets down through the kennel.

2956
03:40:02,639 --> 03:40:06,290
Let me check over here first.

2957
03:40:06,290 --> 03:40:16,000
Shooting range.

2958
03:40:16,000 --> 03:40:22,579
Lunch box. I'm going to

2959
03:40:22,579 --> 03:40:26,670
examine that right now.

2960
03:40:26,670 --> 03:40:30,000
There's something inside.

2961
03:40:30,000 --> 03:40:33,329
And a well-worn key.

2962
03:40:33,329 --> 03:40:37,809
Equipment disposal notice.

2963
03:40:37,809 --> 03:40:41,200
Bent key no longer usable, but

2964
03:40:41,200 --> 03:40:43,200
can still open the car's doors and trunks

2965
03:40:43,200 --> 03:40:45,200
with its keyless entry buttons.

2966
03:40:45,200 --> 03:40:50,450
So it can open car doors and trunks.

2967
03:40:50,450 --> 03:40:53,969
That's excellent to know.

2968
03:40:53,969 --> 03:40:57,360
A message from Mr. Raccoon.

2969
03:40:57,360 --> 03:40:59,540
Howdy, boys and girls.

2970
03:40:59,540 --> 03:41:01,540
This is your pal from the Raccoon City Zoo. It's always great

2971
03:41:01,540 --> 03:41:03,540
to see you. Today I want to talk about

2972
03:41:03,540 --> 03:41:05,540
something really important. You know, my popular Mr.

2973
03:41:05,540 --> 03:41:07,540
Raccoon toys.

2974
03:41:07,540 --> 03:41:09,540
Well, I heard some bad kids have been using them for

2975
03:41:09,540 --> 03:41:13,120
target practice.

2976
03:41:13,120 --> 03:41:15,809
Bobbleheads, right? Good little

2977
03:41:15,809 --> 03:41:17,809
kids wouldn't be that mean, right?

2978
03:41:17,809 --> 03:41:19,809
Plus, it's super dangerous.

2979
03:41:19,809 --> 03:41:25,229
Bobbleheads. That sounds

2980
03:41:25,229 --> 03:41:28,239
like a Garfagraph.

2981
03:41:28,239 --> 03:41:32,590
It really does. But I'm going to assume

2982
03:41:32,590 --> 03:41:34,590
that's the bobbleheads of this game.

2983
03:41:34,590 --> 03:41:36,590
I'd probably be correct, right?

2984
03:41:36,590 --> 03:41:54,940
There's one right there. After you

2985
03:41:54,940 --> 03:41:56,940
shoot ten of them, eight of them, whatever,

2986
03:41:56,940 --> 03:42:01,870
you get probably a gun, right?

2987
03:42:01,870 --> 03:42:03,870
I'm going to get the bad ending if you shoot them. Kind of like a waste

2988
03:42:03,870 --> 03:42:05,870
of bullets, unless I really care, right?

2989
03:42:05,870 --> 03:42:10,860
Uh, can I go this way?

2990
03:42:10,860 --> 03:42:12,860
Yeah.

2991
03:42:12,860 --> 03:42:14,860
I need a diamond key.

2992
03:42:14,860 --> 03:42:18,829
This guy's going to get up.

2993
03:42:18,829 --> 03:42:23,569
Is there a reason to come in here?

2994
03:42:23,569 --> 03:42:29,840
Yeah, shotgun bullets. When I pick these up,

2995
03:42:29,840 --> 03:42:31,840
they're going to stand up. Like every

2996
03:42:31,840 --> 03:42:33,840
video game ever made. No, maybe not.

2997
03:42:33,840 --> 03:42:38,700
Nothing on either one of you?

2998
03:42:38,700 --> 03:42:44,340
But I was going to get my first

2999
03:42:44,340 --> 03:42:46,340
impressions before I got jump scared.

3000
03:42:46,340 --> 03:42:51,379
This is, uh,

3001
03:42:51,379 --> 03:42:53,379
this is very, very good. It's very, very

3002
03:42:53,379 --> 03:42:55,379
sound, fun gameplay.

3003
03:42:55,379 --> 03:42:58,000
How everything's connected and everything

3004
03:42:58,000 --> 03:43:00,000
you can see everything, the doors, everything makes sense.

3005
03:43:00,000 --> 03:43:02,690
It's very, I would,

3006
03:43:02,690 --> 03:43:04,690
I would, this is great. This is a very good

3007
03:43:04,690 --> 03:43:06,690
game so far. It's been

3008
03:43:06,690 --> 03:43:10,530
fantastic. This door's locked.

3009
03:43:10,530 --> 03:43:14,819
You're going to fall through the floor again.

3010
03:43:14,819 --> 03:43:16,819
Imagine, that would be ridiculous.

3011
03:43:16,819 --> 03:43:18,819
At that point, I knew what was going to happen.

3012
03:43:18,819 --> 03:43:20,819
And I'm just pretending

3013
03:43:20,819 --> 03:43:24,079
for the video. You know what I mean?

3014
03:43:24,079 --> 03:43:28,819
This is also blocked off.

3015
03:43:28,819 --> 03:43:30,819
So we can go on.

3016
03:43:30,819 --> 03:43:34,270
Got the key and the crank.

3017
03:43:34,270 --> 03:43:40,930
Let's go around. Just check around the other side.

3018
03:43:40,930 --> 03:43:43,100
Is it a shotgun?

3019
03:43:43,100 --> 03:43:45,100
I thought it's just an umbrella.

3020
03:43:45,100 --> 03:43:47,729
I was like, new shotgun just sitting on a

3021
03:43:47,729 --> 03:43:52,459
bench. Alright, slow down.

3022
03:43:52,459 --> 03:44:03,649
Okay, finally a blue

3023
03:44:03,649 --> 03:44:07,100
herb. We can use that.

3024
03:44:07,100 --> 03:44:13,440
Focus in here. Loaded, right

3025
03:44:13,440 --> 03:44:15,940
loaded. There's the,

3026
03:44:15,940 --> 03:44:20,989
gonna be dogs here.

3027
03:44:20,989 --> 03:44:26,239
Watch out for space. I'm running out of space.

3028
03:44:26,239 --> 03:44:37,059
Mmm, the dogs are gonna be so

3029
03:44:37,059 --> 03:44:39,059
fast too and it's gonna...

3030
03:44:39,059 --> 03:44:41,940
No, oh god. Oh god, just end it.

3031
03:44:41,940 --> 03:44:50,379
Do it!

3032
03:44:50,379 --> 03:44:52,379
Go, go, get out, out, out, out, out before they break out.

3033
03:44:52,379 --> 03:44:54,379
They're gonna break out. They're gonna, just go, go, go, go, go, go, run, run.

3034
03:44:54,379 --> 03:44:59,120
Just run through. Vent?

3035
03:44:59,120 --> 03:45:02,319
Is it a dog door? Watch out for the dog door.

3036
03:45:02,319 --> 03:45:04,620
Where am I?

3037
03:45:04,620 --> 03:45:16,139
It's actually a doggy door.

3038
03:45:16,139 --> 03:45:26,000
Well, here's a crank.

3039
03:45:26,000 --> 03:45:29,260
That'll bring it back out here.

3040
03:45:29,260 --> 03:45:31,260
What is out here?

3041
03:45:31,260 --> 03:45:39,180
There's the generator room

3042
03:45:39,180 --> 03:45:41,180
over there. Let me go to the morgue first.

3043
03:45:41,180 --> 03:45:45,659
That fucking doggy

3044
03:45:45,659 --> 03:45:54,559
door. Autopsy record

3045
03:45:54,559 --> 03:45:56,559
number 53,477.

3046
03:45:56,559 --> 03:45:58,799
Found

3047
03:45:58,799 --> 03:46:00,799
dead in jail cell, bed by

3048
03:46:00,799 --> 03:46:02,799
staff. Clenched due to

3049
03:46:02,799 --> 03:46:05,229
a rig of mortis.

3050
03:46:05,229 --> 03:46:07,229
Seized to his known kleptomaniac.

3051
03:46:07,229 --> 03:46:10,299
He would steal

3052
03:46:10,299 --> 03:46:12,299
even while in jail, though that was

3053
03:46:12,299 --> 03:46:14,299
consistent with his clinical diagnosis.

3054
03:46:14,299 --> 03:46:24,610
Why do I hear shit right now?

3055
03:46:24,610 --> 03:46:27,420
Someone's gonna break out of one of these

3056
03:46:27,420 --> 03:46:34,780
fucking doors. Here we go.

3057
03:46:34,780 --> 03:46:39,069
Somebody's gonna be on one of these dinner

3058
03:46:39,069 --> 03:46:44,510
plates. Ah,

3059
03:46:44,510 --> 03:46:47,649
fuck. Yep, he's gonna

3060
03:46:47,649 --> 03:46:57,250
jump out. What are you holding?

3061
03:46:57,250 --> 03:47:00,180
Diamond key.

3062
03:47:00,180 --> 03:47:02,670
Wait! I knew it, I knew it, I

3063
03:47:02,670 --> 03:47:07,860
knew it, I knew it.

3064
03:47:07,860 --> 03:47:12,530
Where did you come from?

3065
03:47:12,530 --> 03:47:24,100
No, I didn't,

3066
03:47:24,100 --> 03:47:26,100
I didn't want to do that. I keep thinking it's

3067
03:47:26,100 --> 03:47:48,290
knife. He's gonna, whatever.

3068
03:47:48,290 --> 03:47:50,290
Come on, where's the jackpot? There's gotta be something here.

3069
03:47:50,290 --> 03:48:02,129
Come on, give me a jackpot.

3070
03:48:02,129 --> 03:48:05,440
That's not a jackpot.

3071
03:48:05,440 --> 03:48:18,299
That's just a flash grenade.

3072
03:48:18,299 --> 03:48:21,379
Really? No jackpot?

3073
03:48:21,379 --> 03:48:24,049
What the hell

3074
03:48:24,049 --> 03:48:29,100
are these bugs?

3075
03:48:29,100 --> 03:48:31,100
Their faces? I don't know.

3076
03:48:31,100 --> 03:48:36,290
Red herb, I'll take it.

3077
03:48:36,290 --> 03:48:43,899
I can do three, though. Red,

3078
03:48:43,899 --> 03:48:45,899
blue, green.

3079
03:48:45,899 --> 03:48:47,899
Is a full superheal, right?

3080
03:48:47,899 --> 03:48:51,920
And that will

3081
03:48:51,920 --> 03:48:57,620
come out of all three of them.

3082
03:48:57,620 --> 03:48:59,620
That's a superheal and it's poison.

3083
03:48:59,620 --> 03:49:10,620
So we need to hold onto this until

3084
03:49:10,620 --> 03:49:12,620
we really, really need it.

3085
03:49:12,620 --> 03:49:14,620
It's a defense bonus poison heal superheal.

3086
03:49:14,620 --> 03:49:25,680
Good.

3087
03:49:25,680 --> 03:49:27,680
That wasn't really a jackpot, but I'll take it.

3088
03:49:27,680 --> 03:49:30,299
Nothing else in here.

3089
03:49:30,299 --> 03:49:37,579
Bullets are doing fine.

3090
03:49:37,579 --> 03:49:40,139
Alright, let's get to the generator

3091
03:49:40,139 --> 03:49:44,430
room. RGB

3092
03:49:44,430 --> 03:49:47,500
healing? Yeah.

3093
03:49:47,500 --> 03:49:52,219
Now, there's supposed to be a piece in here.

3094
03:49:52,219 --> 03:50:01,379
Right? Somewhere.

3095
03:50:01,379 --> 03:50:04,260
Box electronic part is one of

3096
03:50:04,260 --> 03:50:06,260
two. And then I gotta go to the clock

3097
03:50:06,260 --> 03:50:10,100
tower. Wherever that is.

3098
03:50:10,100 --> 03:50:12,270
Doggy door, you're not gonna

3099
03:50:12,270 --> 03:50:38,959
fucking fool me. I'm so paranoid

3100
03:50:38,959 --> 03:50:45,620
right now. Okay, so this is

3101
03:50:45,620 --> 03:50:47,620
on, on, on, on.

3102
03:50:47,620 --> 03:50:52,209
They're all on.

3103
03:50:52,209 --> 03:50:56,500
That didn't do anything. Maybe

3104
03:50:56,500 --> 03:50:58,500
on, off, on, on?

3105
03:50:58,500 --> 03:51:06,620
So they'll probably all have to be both

3106
03:51:06,620 --> 03:51:10,079
Okay, I see. So I think both need to be

3107
03:51:10,079 --> 03:51:12,079
in the red. So we got it on.

3108
03:51:12,079 --> 03:51:14,260
That's it, right? No, not quite.

3109
03:51:14,260 --> 03:51:20,959
There it is. Gotta hit that

3110
03:51:20,959 --> 03:51:33,180
sweet spot.

3111
03:51:33,180 --> 03:51:35,620
Where? I see the shadow!

3112
03:51:35,620 --> 03:51:45,280
One climbed over.

3113
03:51:45,280 --> 03:51:52,260
Hey!

3114
03:51:52,260 --> 03:51:58,590
There's a heal right there. Just give me the heal.

3115
03:51:58,590 --> 03:52:05,250
I got enough room for it. Why do I have

3116
03:52:05,250 --> 03:52:07,250
the boards? The boards are so useless

3117
03:52:07,250 --> 03:52:09,250
right now. I don't even need them.

3118
03:52:09,250 --> 03:52:12,940
Alright, bingo.

3119
03:52:12,940 --> 03:52:14,940
Where the fuck is the dog? Where is the dog?

3120
03:52:14,940 --> 03:52:17,889
He's sticking his head through the dog door.

3121
03:52:17,889 --> 03:52:23,459
Shit!

3122
03:52:23,459 --> 03:52:25,889
Oh, I hate it.

3123
03:52:25,889 --> 03:52:42,850
Where was it? Where was it?

3124
03:52:42,850 --> 03:53:03,379
I'm gonna shot it again.

3125
03:53:03,379 --> 03:53:05,379
Okay, so I gotta get out of here, then go all the way around

3126
03:53:05,379 --> 03:53:09,200
and up.

3127
03:53:09,200 --> 03:53:11,200
Oh, my fucking face!

3128
03:53:11,200 --> 03:53:15,229
Son of a bitch.

3129
03:53:15,229 --> 03:53:23,420
I know, really. Jesus!

3130
03:53:23,420 --> 03:53:25,600
Okay, we're good.

3131
03:53:25,600 --> 03:53:27,600
We're safe. That's all the dogs. No more dogs.

3132
03:53:27,600 --> 03:53:33,420
No more dog doors.

3133
03:53:33,420 --> 03:53:47,059
Is there another dog? That's what opened over here

3134
03:53:47,059 --> 03:53:52,430
and then bang it left.

3135
03:53:52,430 --> 03:53:54,989
Okay, I made it. Nothing else, right?

3136
03:53:54,989 --> 03:54:05,469
I think we're good.

3137
03:54:05,469 --> 03:54:11,420
There they go. That brings us all the way

3138
03:54:11,420 --> 03:54:14,180
up here. Oh, wow. We're back at

3139
03:54:14,180 --> 03:54:16,540
the main halls out here.

3140
03:54:16,540 --> 03:54:19,100
Very cool.

3141
03:54:19,100 --> 03:54:29,579
Combine. Key for the range.

3142
03:54:29,579 --> 03:54:39,309
Mission key for a car. Blade is bent.

3143
03:54:39,309 --> 03:54:43,600
I need to get to...

3144
03:54:43,600 --> 03:54:45,600
Let me get to a save point first and then I can go back.

3145
03:54:45,600 --> 03:54:47,600
There's like a break room here.

3146
03:54:47,600 --> 03:54:54,879
There we go.

3147
03:54:54,879 --> 03:54:58,399
This is...

3148
03:54:58,399 --> 03:55:01,600
Is there a storage unit in here?

3149
03:55:01,600 --> 03:55:03,600
Shit, there's no unit in here.

3150
03:55:03,600 --> 03:55:06,989
Electrical part. Shit.

3151
03:55:06,989 --> 03:55:11,729
Okay, I need a box.

3152
03:55:11,729 --> 03:55:15,059
Oh, I need a box.

3153
03:55:15,059 --> 03:55:18,049
Hey, look, there's a box.

3154
03:55:18,049 --> 03:55:20,049
Okay, so...

3155
03:55:20,049 --> 03:55:23,309
I store this for a second.

3156
03:55:23,309 --> 03:55:25,309
I just need... I gotta see what I got here.

3157
03:55:25,309 --> 03:55:27,620
Another key.

3158
03:55:27,620 --> 03:55:34,459
Still don't need the jewel yet.

3159
03:55:34,459 --> 03:55:39,969
I'm probably gonna need this.

3160
03:55:39,969 --> 03:55:46,030
Yeah, I have

3161
03:55:46,030 --> 03:55:48,270
the red herbs to combine with.

3162
03:55:48,270 --> 03:55:53,520
Yes, yes, yes.

3163
03:55:53,520 --> 03:55:57,809
Okay. Gunpowder. I got a gunpowder.

3164
03:55:57,809 --> 03:55:59,809
I can make some shotgun ammo, right?

3165
03:55:59,809 --> 03:56:01,809
Because I have one more. Do I have any yellow?

3166
03:56:01,809 --> 03:56:06,219
Yeah, I do. Shotgun ammo.

3167
03:56:06,219 --> 03:56:11,920
I can make some more pistol ammo.

3168
03:56:11,920 --> 03:56:19,389
Yeah, I'll do it. Why not?

3169
03:56:19,389 --> 03:56:24,450
Because then I can keep this one gunpowder.

3170
03:56:24,450 --> 03:56:26,450
This window is here to board. That's a good idea.

3171
03:56:26,450 --> 03:56:30,799
Don't need the flash.

3172
03:56:30,799 --> 03:56:32,799
There was another place down where I could

3173
03:56:32,799 --> 03:56:35,040
use this. Wasn't there

3174
03:56:35,040 --> 03:56:37,340
somewhere down on like the actual

3175
03:56:37,340 --> 03:56:41,760
floor here? I'm glad to be here.

3176
03:56:41,760 --> 03:56:44,899
Thank you.

3177
03:56:44,899 --> 03:56:47,260
Glad to have you. Thanks for sticking around.

3178
03:56:47,260 --> 03:56:51,870
If you don't organize it,

3179
03:56:51,870 --> 03:56:53,870
then I'm gonna be very mad.

3180
03:56:53,870 --> 03:56:58,670
See?

3181
03:56:58,670 --> 03:57:07,120
Got two boards,

3182
03:57:07,120 --> 03:57:09,680
45, car key,

3183
03:57:09,680 --> 03:57:12,819
and

3184
03:57:12,819 --> 03:57:15,500
I have to stop. I have to.

3185
03:57:15,500 --> 03:57:21,120
I'm sorry.

3186
03:57:21,120 --> 03:57:24,639
Sorry that we have to stop so early.

3187
03:57:24,639 --> 03:57:27,329
But, like, I can feel it now.

3188
03:57:27,329 --> 03:57:31,299
So. Kind of

3189
03:57:31,299 --> 03:57:33,299
annoying that this has kind of happened twice, two streams in a row.

3190
03:57:33,299 --> 03:57:35,469
But,

3191
03:57:35,469 --> 03:57:37,780
uh, I got another doctor's

3192
03:57:37,780 --> 03:57:39,780
appointment coming up. So I'm gonna

3193
03:57:39,780 --> 03:57:44,059
bring it up again. But,

3194
03:57:44,059 --> 03:57:46,620
uh, I'm fine. Don't worry.

3195
03:57:46,620 --> 03:57:49,309
I just kind of have like another weird

3196
03:57:49,309 --> 03:57:51,309
headache again. That like won't

3197
03:57:51,309 --> 03:57:53,489
really go away. So,

3198
03:57:53,489 --> 03:57:57,389
uh, I hate to

3199
03:57:57,389 --> 03:58:00,459
stop after four hours.

3200
03:58:00,459 --> 03:58:02,459
But I have to.

3201
03:58:02,459 --> 03:58:04,459
I don't want to just like do it.

3202
03:58:04,459 --> 03:58:06,459
I'd rather enjoy this and like be able to have

3203
03:58:06,459 --> 03:58:08,459
fun and hang out with you guys and actually

3204
03:58:08,459 --> 03:58:10,459
not have to think about like this.

3205
03:58:10,459 --> 03:58:13,020
So, uh, we're gonna try tomorrow.

3206
03:58:13,020 --> 03:58:16,100
We're gonna do it again tomorrow.

3207
03:58:16,100 --> 03:58:18,100
Uh, take care of yourselves if you're gonna take off.

3208
03:58:18,100 --> 03:58:20,100
I can still do the bits.

3209
03:58:20,100 --> 03:58:22,100
We've only been streaming for about four hours, so.

3210
03:58:22,100 --> 03:58:25,040
Uh, sorry

3211
03:58:25,040 --> 03:58:27,040
again that we have to stop.

3212
03:58:27,040 --> 03:58:29,540
Trust me, I want to

3213
03:58:29,540 --> 03:58:32,290
stream. But it's kind of annoying.

3214
03:58:32,290 --> 03:58:34,290
Really annoying, actually. But whatever.

3215
03:58:34,290 --> 03:58:37,100
You do what you gotta do, right?

3216
03:58:37,100 --> 03:58:39,100
Uh, thank you for watching. We're gonna just, we're gonna pick up

3217
03:58:39,100 --> 03:58:41,100
exactly right here tomorrow. Exactly

3218
03:58:41,100 --> 03:58:43,659
where we left off. And

3219
03:58:43,659 --> 03:58:45,840
we'll try again. Thank you

3220
03:58:45,840 --> 03:58:47,840
so much for your patience and understanding, everybody.

3221
03:58:47,840 --> 03:58:49,840
Uh, there's a lot of support

3222
03:58:49,840 --> 03:58:51,840
tonight, like there always is.

3223
03:58:51,840 --> 03:58:53,840
Much love to you. Thank you so much for coming out.

3224
03:58:53,840 --> 03:58:57,100
And I even had a day off yesterday, too.

3225
03:58:57,100 --> 03:58:59,729
I sure just streamed yesterday. I felt

3226
03:58:59,729 --> 03:59:03,680
fine. Whatever.

3227
03:59:03,680 --> 03:59:06,110
Uh, take care, guys.

3228
03:59:06,110 --> 03:59:11,739
Did I even feel fine? I don't remember.

3229
03:59:11,739 --> 03:59:16,930
I probably did.

3230
03:59:16,930 --> 03:59:22,299
Yesterday you said tomorrow. So

3231
03:59:22,299 --> 03:59:24,299
I'll see you again tomorrow. I want

3232
03:59:24,299 --> 03:59:26,299
I'm gonna complete this on stream because it's a great

3233
03:59:26,299 --> 03:59:29,760
game. I'm having a bunch of fun so far.

3234
03:59:29,760 --> 03:59:32,190
But let's do the bits.

3235
03:59:32,190 --> 03:59:34,190
This, uh, we don't have very much to go through, I don't think.

3236
03:59:34,190 --> 03:59:36,190
So, no, not really.

3237
03:59:36,190 --> 03:59:38,190
So it shouldn't take us too long.

3238
03:59:38,190 --> 03:59:43,500
We had, uh, Dala from

3239
03:59:43,500 --> 03:59:45,809
Timmy Tim Tam. Thank you, Timmy Tim Tam.

3240
03:59:45,809 --> 03:59:51,950
No bits. Go to bed.

3241
03:59:51,950 --> 03:59:55,979
No, we're okay.

3242
03:59:55,979 --> 03:59:57,979
We're okay. I can, I can do this.

3243
03:59:57,979 --> 04:00:00,350
I'll be good. There's only about

3244
04:00:00,350 --> 04:00:02,350
maybe 10 to 15 to go through

3245
04:00:02,350 --> 04:00:09,329
anyways. But let's, uh,

3246
04:00:09,329 --> 04:00:12,399
Timmy Tim Tam, thanks for the Dala.

3247
04:00:12,399 --> 04:00:14,399
Uh, it's a YouTube link.

3248
04:00:14,399 --> 04:00:17,200
Another daily conversation in

3249
04:00:17,200 --> 04:00:19,200
English. See what it is.

3250
04:00:19,200 --> 04:00:21,200
How about a drink?

3251
04:00:21,200 --> 04:00:24,079
How about a drink tonight?

3252
04:00:24,079 --> 04:00:26,079
I'd love to. Where can we

3253
04:00:26,079 --> 04:00:28,079
meet? How about the Relax Bar?

3254
04:00:28,079 --> 04:00:30,079
Alright. What time?

3255
04:00:30,079 --> 04:00:32,079
Is eight o'clock okay? Yes.

3256
04:00:32,079 --> 04:00:34,079
That's fine. I will meet you there.

3257
04:00:34,079 --> 04:00:36,079
I'm really looking forward to it.

3258
04:00:36,079 --> 04:00:38,770
Me too.

3259
04:00:38,770 --> 04:00:41,329
That was like a pretty normal

3260
04:00:41,329 --> 04:00:43,700
conversation. But thank you.

3261
04:00:43,700 --> 04:00:45,700
Thank you Sad Vega for the one Dala. Oh boy,

3262
04:00:45,700 --> 04:00:47,700
Resident Evil 2. Hope you do this hardcore.

3263
04:00:47,700 --> 04:00:49,700
You're robbing yourself for great experience if you don't

3264
04:00:49,700 --> 04:00:51,700
do hardcore first time through.

3265
04:00:51,700 --> 04:00:53,700
Uh, let me tell you hardcore

3266
04:00:53,700 --> 04:00:55,700
mode first time. Woo, will you be the

3267
04:00:55,700 --> 04:00:59,659
on the edge of your seat?

3268
04:00:59,659 --> 04:01:01,659
No, we're gonna do normal. I just wanna play through.

3269
04:01:01,659 --> 04:01:03,659
I don't wanna panic.

3270
04:01:03,659 --> 04:01:05,840
Thank you Alec for the one Dala.

3271
04:01:05,840 --> 04:01:07,840
Can't wait to see you scream at Mr. X.

3272
04:01:07,840 --> 04:01:11,040
I don't know what that is.

3273
04:01:11,040 --> 04:01:13,040
But, I'm, I'm sure

3274
04:01:13,040 --> 04:01:15,040
whatever, whoever that is.

3275
04:01:15,040 --> 04:01:17,469
Dork Cube, thanks for the one Dala. My brother and I

3276
04:01:17,469 --> 04:01:19,469
were watching back through your subscriber milestone

3277
04:01:19,469 --> 04:01:21,469
videos. And when I told him that

3278
04:01:21,469 --> 04:01:23,469
Burger Boy was married, he was amazed

3279
04:01:23,469 --> 04:01:25,469
that even the egg could find love.

3280
04:01:25,469 --> 04:01:28,659
Yeah.

3281
04:01:28,659 --> 04:01:30,659
Look at everybody. There's somebody out there for everybody guys.

3282
04:01:30,659 --> 04:01:33,280
Don't worry.

3283
04:01:33,280 --> 04:01:35,280
Uh, thank you Crusade for the four Dala's.

3284
04:01:35,280 --> 04:01:37,280
Thank you Divus for the two Dala's.

3285
04:01:37,280 --> 04:01:40,739
Thank you guys.

3286
04:01:40,739 --> 04:01:42,739
Uh, thank you Frick Nut

3287
04:01:42,739 --> 04:01:44,739
for the one Dala. Pause the game, I need to pee.

3288
04:01:44,739 --> 04:01:48,770
You can pee right now?

3289
04:01:48,770 --> 04:01:51,899
You get time to pee right now?

3290
04:01:51,899 --> 04:01:53,899
Flug Boy, thanks for the one Dala. So I honestly have been

3291
04:01:53,899 --> 04:01:55,899
trying to stay away from watching Resident Evil 2 gameplay.

3292
04:01:55,899 --> 04:01:57,899
But I couldn't stay away from watching yours.

3293
04:01:57,899 --> 04:01:59,899
I just wanna say after Resident Evil 7

3294
04:01:59,899 --> 04:02:01,899
this will be my first Resident Evil game.

3295
04:02:01,899 --> 04:02:03,899
And I wanna go back and play the other.

3296
04:02:03,899 --> 04:02:05,899
Do you think it's worth to buy the

3297
04:02:05,899 --> 04:02:07,899
previous consoles for it?

3298
04:02:07,899 --> 04:02:10,399
Uh, I don't think you need to.

3299
04:02:10,399 --> 04:02:13,149
At least

3300
04:02:13,149 --> 04:02:15,149
three or four of them have been ported, right?

3301
04:02:15,149 --> 04:02:17,520
Aren't there at least

3302
04:02:17,520 --> 04:02:19,520
a few of them that have been ported to the PC?

3303
04:02:19,520 --> 04:02:26,690
I don't think you have to go back to like

3304
04:02:26,690 --> 04:02:28,690
the old old consoles.

3305
04:02:28,690 --> 04:02:32,459
But they're great games.

3306
04:02:32,459 --> 04:02:34,459
Some of them are a little old and dated.

3307
04:02:34,459 --> 04:02:37,090
But

3308
04:02:37,090 --> 04:02:39,090
I think they're still all great experiences.

3309
04:02:39,090 --> 04:02:41,090
As long as you can stomach a lot of

3310
04:02:41,090 --> 04:02:43,090
kind of old school type of

3311
04:02:43,090 --> 04:02:46,219
gameplay.

3312
04:02:46,219 --> 04:02:48,219
Resident Evil 3 Remake is coming up for sure after this.

3313
04:02:48,219 --> 04:02:50,219
I would be surprised if they didn't

3314
04:02:50,219 --> 04:02:52,219
just do them all. Up until 4.

3315
04:02:52,219 --> 04:02:54,219
I mean they already kind of did one.

3316
04:02:54,219 --> 04:02:57,549
But not like this.

3317
04:02:57,549 --> 04:02:59,549
But thank you Flugboy for the two dollars.

3318
04:02:59,549 --> 04:03:01,549
Also sorry for the lack of bits. I hope you're doing well Jeremy.

3319
04:03:01,549 --> 04:03:03,549
Much love to you, Kim, and Italics, and the rest of the family.

3320
04:03:03,549 --> 04:03:06,819
Uh, don't worry about

3321
04:03:06,819 --> 04:03:08,819
a lack of money. You don't have to

3322
04:03:08,819 --> 04:03:10,819
you don't have to pay me.

3323
04:03:10,819 --> 04:03:12,819
Don't worry about that. Thank you for

3324
04:03:12,819 --> 04:03:14,819
sticking around. Thanks for watching. Thanks for the support as always.

3325
04:03:14,819 --> 04:03:17,250
Uh, robot mentality

3326
04:03:17,250 --> 04:03:19,250
thanks for the one dollar.

3327
04:03:19,250 --> 04:03:21,250
Andy's mountain thanks for the five dollars.

3328
04:03:21,250 --> 04:03:23,250
Hey Jeremy, are you still planning on releasing

3329
04:03:23,250 --> 04:03:25,250
shirts? Tomorrow or

3330
04:03:25,250 --> 04:03:27,250
Wednesday.

3331
04:03:27,250 --> 04:03:29,250
It'll be a storefront. It'll be there forever.

3332
04:03:29,250 --> 04:03:31,680
Because I can do other stuff besides shirts.

3333
04:03:31,680 --> 04:03:35,329
Uh, thank you Jeremiah

3334
04:03:35,329 --> 04:03:37,329
for the five dollars. I love you

3335
04:03:37,329 --> 04:03:39,329
Jerma, but your incompetence dishonored a great

3336
04:03:39,329 --> 04:03:41,329
game with Toy Commander.

3337
04:03:41,329 --> 04:03:44,459
Uh, that's alright.

3338
04:03:44,459 --> 04:03:48,500
Toy Commander was fun.

3339
04:03:48,500 --> 04:03:52,659
I don't need to watch Speedrun.

3340
04:03:52,659 --> 04:03:55,219
Appreciate the five dollars though. Thank you.

3341
04:03:55,219 --> 04:03:57,780
Uh, Anonilus thanks for the

3342
04:03:57,780 --> 04:03:59,780
one dollar. Anonilus, hey Jerma, it's the Animal Rescue

3343
04:03:59,780 --> 04:04:01,780
guy. Just wanted to say thanks for having people go to my

3344
04:04:01,780 --> 04:04:03,780
baby duck stream.

3345
04:04:03,780 --> 04:04:06,139
I truly didn't expect that.

3346
04:04:06,139 --> 04:04:08,139
Hoping a few people got cheered up by watching them. Thanks again.

3347
04:04:08,139 --> 04:04:10,579
For sure, yeah.

3348
04:04:10,579 --> 04:04:16,450
They're very cute ducks.

3349
04:04:16,450 --> 04:04:20,799
Everybody loves ducks. But thank you.

3350
04:04:20,799 --> 04:04:24,260
Uh, we had some big bits just coming

3351
04:04:24,260 --> 04:04:26,750
right now from

3352
04:04:26,750 --> 04:04:28,750
uh, Gornhole. Fifty dollars from Gornhole.

3353
04:04:28,750 --> 04:04:30,930
Thank you.

3354
04:04:30,930 --> 04:04:34,260
Here have some bits for the Bitcoin operated

3355
04:04:34,260 --> 04:04:36,260
doctor on the Vegas Strip. I hear he's

3356
04:04:36,260 --> 04:04:38,260
great at telling the future for 25 cents

3357
04:04:38,260 --> 04:04:40,260
a pop. What?

3358
04:04:40,260 --> 04:04:43,709
Thank you so much for the fifty dollars Gornhole

3359
04:04:43,709 --> 04:04:45,709
Adder. Is that even real?

3360
04:04:45,709 --> 04:04:49,299
That's not a real thing, is it?

3361
04:04:49,299 --> 04:04:56,270
Thank you so much.

3362
04:04:56,270 --> 04:05:01,069
And then the Olaf gave us

3363
04:05:01,069 --> 04:05:03,069
a million subs. Thank you so

3364
04:05:03,069 --> 04:05:05,069
much. That's so much.

3365
04:05:05,069 --> 04:05:07,069
So much, so much. I just said so much so many times.

3366
04:05:07,069 --> 04:05:09,700
But thank you.

3367
04:05:09,700 --> 04:05:13,409
Uh, Apocalyptic Cheeseburger.

3368
04:05:13,409 --> 04:05:15,409
Thank you again for fifteen dollars

3369
04:05:15,409 --> 04:05:17,409
and fifty on top of that.

3370
04:05:17,409 --> 04:05:20,159
Cox seems to have gotten the message

3371
04:05:20,159 --> 04:05:22,159
from my friend from Nevada.

3372
04:05:22,159 --> 04:05:24,159
Who works with them said there

3373
04:05:24,159 --> 04:05:26,159
was a surge a few

3374
04:05:26,159 --> 04:05:28,159
minutes ago when I asked him about it.

3375
04:05:28,159 --> 04:05:33,139
Really?

3376
04:05:33,139 --> 04:05:35,139
So that was, there was a surge?

3377
04:05:35,139 --> 04:05:37,309
So should I not have been

3378
04:05:37,309 --> 04:05:39,309
talking all that shit? Of course I should have.

3379
04:05:39,309 --> 04:05:42,510
Was there more money?

3380
04:05:42,510 --> 04:05:46,860
Lakronda, fifty dollars.

3381
04:05:46,860 --> 04:05:48,860
My goodness, thank you. Fifty more dollars.

3382
04:05:48,860 --> 04:05:53,860
You guys are showing me so much

3383
04:05:53,860 --> 04:05:55,860
love and so much support. I gotta get like

3384
04:05:55,860 --> 04:06:00,979
a full stream in here.

3385
04:06:00,979 --> 04:06:02,979
Four hours, four and a half, five hours. I usually

3386
04:06:02,979 --> 04:06:04,979
like to go for like six to eight.

3387
04:06:04,979 --> 04:06:07,219
Where's my goddamn stamina lately?

3388
04:06:07,219 --> 04:06:09,219
With these fucking migraine

3389
04:06:09,219 --> 04:06:11,520
things.

3390
04:06:11,520 --> 04:06:13,819
Thank you. They say, hey Jeremy, I love

3391
04:06:13,819 --> 04:06:15,819
donating to you. I plan on donating even more in the future.

3392
04:06:15,819 --> 04:06:17,819
I love the rush of being

3393
04:06:17,819 --> 04:06:19,819
noticed by somebody I idolize.

3394
04:06:19,819 --> 04:06:22,639
Well let me tell you one very

3395
04:06:22,639 --> 04:06:25,329
important thing. You don't

3396
04:06:25,329 --> 04:06:27,329
have to pay me to do that.

3397
04:06:27,329 --> 04:06:30,209
I hope you know that it doesn't matter if

3398
04:06:30,209 --> 04:06:32,209
you give me fifty dollars, a hundred dollars,

3399
04:06:32,209 --> 04:06:34,209
two dollars, five dollars. Thank you.

3400
04:06:34,209 --> 04:06:36,209
Like you're

3401
04:06:36,209 --> 04:06:38,209
allowing me to do this

3402
04:06:38,209 --> 04:06:41,149
and do it for a living.

3403
04:06:41,149 --> 04:06:43,149
You don't have to worry about paying me that much

3404
04:06:43,149 --> 04:06:46,159
money. I just hope you all know that.

3405
04:06:46,159 --> 04:06:49,940
There's no

3406
04:06:49,940 --> 04:06:51,940
requirement to have to give

3407
04:06:51,940 --> 04:06:53,940
me money so I'll

3408
04:06:53,940 --> 04:06:55,940
be thanking you. You know what I mean?

3409
04:06:55,940 --> 04:06:57,940
You being here by yourself

3410
04:06:57,940 --> 04:06:59,940
one out of

3411
04:06:59,940 --> 04:07:04,219
doesn't matter how many people.

3412
04:07:04,219 --> 04:07:07,360
I appreciate you nonetheless. But thank you

3413
04:07:07,360 --> 04:07:09,360
so much for even thinking about doing it in the first place.

3414
04:07:09,360 --> 04:07:12,110
That goes for everybody.

3415
04:07:12,110 --> 04:07:18,770
Back earlier after some

3416
04:07:18,770 --> 04:07:21,329
of these huge community subs.

3417
04:07:21,329 --> 04:07:23,329
But thank you Apocalyptic

3418
04:07:23,329 --> 04:07:25,329
Cheeseburger. Hopefully that

3419
04:07:25,329 --> 04:07:27,329
was just a problem.

3420
04:07:27,329 --> 04:07:29,329
And it's fine now because that would be

3421
04:07:29,329 --> 04:07:31,329
very annoying if it didn't go away, which it's been weird

3422
04:07:31,329 --> 04:07:33,329
the last week.

3423
04:07:33,329 --> 04:07:35,569
Thank you Meow for the one dollar. Have fun

3424
04:07:35,569 --> 04:07:37,569
getting spooked Jerma. I know

3425
04:07:37,569 --> 04:07:39,569
I did on my first playthrough. It's been pretty scary.

3426
04:07:39,569 --> 04:07:42,770
It's been pretty good.

3427
04:07:42,770 --> 04:07:45,649
There's been some decent scares.

3428
04:07:45,649 --> 04:07:47,649
Thank you Ike Turtle for the one dollar. The game's graphics

3429
04:07:47,649 --> 04:07:49,649
were very impressive. That sweaty zombie in the corner

3430
04:07:49,649 --> 04:07:51,649
looked very realistic

3431
04:07:51,649 --> 04:07:54,459
and frightening.

3432
04:07:54,459 --> 04:07:56,459
Also this. I look like Leon Kennedy.

3433
04:07:56,459 --> 04:08:00,239
Yeah, good.

3434
04:08:00,239 --> 04:08:02,239
From the Christmas stream. Yeah, he's a handsome guy.

3435
04:08:02,239 --> 04:08:05,889
Hey Solid Milk

3436
04:08:05,889 --> 04:08:07,889
thanks for the dollar. Cox controls

3437
04:08:07,889 --> 04:08:09,889
compact consumers crappy connection.

3438
04:08:09,889 --> 04:08:12,700
The six C's

3439
04:08:12,700 --> 04:08:16,290
is true.

3440
04:08:16,290 --> 04:08:18,290
Hey 99Trader thanks for the 10 bucks.

3441
04:08:18,290 --> 04:08:20,290
Hey Jerma, just hoping you're having a good time playing the game as we

3442
04:08:20,290 --> 04:08:22,290
are watching you get scared to shit.

3443
04:08:22,290 --> 04:08:24,459
Thank you for 10 dollars and yeah

3444
04:08:24,459 --> 04:08:26,459
I wish I could keep going.

3445
04:08:26,459 --> 04:08:31,840
But I need to know my own

3446
04:08:31,840 --> 04:08:35,489
limitations. And I've told you guys this

3447
04:08:35,489 --> 04:08:37,489
a lot of times. I don't, if I

3448
04:08:37,489 --> 04:08:39,489
know that I'm not going to be able to put forth something

3449
04:08:39,489 --> 04:08:42,370
that's, I don't

3450
04:08:42,370 --> 04:08:44,370
want to force myself to do something.

3451
04:08:44,370 --> 04:08:47,500
And if I know in my

3452
04:08:47,500 --> 04:08:49,500
brain and in my heart that I know that

3453
04:08:49,500 --> 04:08:51,500
I'm going to have to like force myself to

3454
04:08:51,500 --> 04:08:53,500
do this and kind of power through

3455
04:08:53,500 --> 04:08:56,129
an issue, I'd

3456
04:08:56,129 --> 04:08:58,129
I'd rather do it again. Just do it again.

3457
04:08:58,129 --> 04:09:00,129
We can just go again and

3458
04:09:00,129 --> 04:09:02,129
have fun. Not like, not like I wasn't

3459
04:09:02,129 --> 04:09:04,129
having any fun but I could, I could

3460
04:09:04,129 --> 04:09:06,129
just tell. I could feel it. And it's starting to happen now

3461
04:09:06,129 --> 04:09:09,010
too.

3462
04:09:09,010 --> 04:09:11,010
But that's just kind of a mentality I've always had.

3463
04:09:11,010 --> 04:09:13,440
But thank you so much for the 10 bucks.

3464
04:09:13,440 --> 04:09:15,440
Thank you Sosredo for the three

3465
04:09:15,440 --> 04:09:17,440
dollars. It's a clip. Let's see what it is.

3466
04:09:17,440 --> 04:09:19,440
He wasn't, no no I was having, I was having a

3467
04:09:19,440 --> 04:09:21,440
lot of fun. This game's fucking awesome.

3468
04:09:21,440 --> 04:09:25,149
It's just, why is this

3469
04:09:25,149 --> 04:09:30,510
black screen? Alright back to the dark room.

3470
04:09:30,510 --> 04:09:32,510
And the storage box, I'm going to confirm.

3471
04:09:32,510 --> 04:09:40,579
That's why I don't like the face cam.

3472
04:09:40,579 --> 04:09:42,750
Really.

3473
04:09:42,750 --> 04:09:44,750
Joel, thank, not Joel, thank you

3474
04:09:44,750 --> 04:09:46,750
iammonk for the one dollar. Joel has your

3475
04:09:46,750 --> 04:09:49,309
back.

3476
04:09:49,309 --> 04:09:55,389
Short people got

3477
04:09:55,389 --> 04:09:58,979
no

3478
04:09:58,979 --> 04:10:00,979
short people got

3479
04:10:00,979 --> 04:10:04,110
no short people got

3480
04:10:04,110 --> 04:10:06,110
no reason to

3481
04:10:06,110 --> 04:10:08,110
live.

3482
04:10:08,110 --> 04:10:10,479
We just had Jerma host us.

3483
04:10:10,479 --> 04:10:12,479
We're not going to have this.

3484
04:10:12,479 --> 04:10:15,040
He's got my back.

3485
04:10:15,040 --> 04:10:17,040
That's enough.

3486
04:10:17,040 --> 04:10:19,040
I can't

3487
04:10:19,040 --> 04:10:21,040
laugh that hard right now.

3488
04:10:24,299 --> 04:10:26,299
Joel, all I gotta say is one thing.

3489
04:10:26,299 --> 04:10:28,299
Just play it to the fucking gamer

3490
04:10:28,299 --> 04:10:31,379
challenge.

3491
04:10:31,379 --> 04:10:33,379
He's so bad at games.

3492
04:10:33,379 --> 04:10:35,379
Just while I'm going to turn it on, I'm going to destroy you

3493
04:10:35,379 --> 04:10:37,379
in the video gamer challenge.

3494
04:10:37,379 --> 04:10:42,290
What happened to

3495
04:10:42,290 --> 04:10:44,290
Jerma? He sounds sad. I'm not sad.

3496
04:10:44,290 --> 04:10:46,290
I'm perfectly fucking happy. Everything's great.

3497
04:10:46,290 --> 04:10:48,290
Except for I've developed

3498
04:10:48,290 --> 04:10:50,290
another headache here.

3499
04:10:50,290 --> 04:10:52,290
In the middle of the stream and I'm doing just alright.

3500
04:10:52,290 --> 04:10:56,829
I'm doing fine.

3501
04:10:56,829 --> 04:10:58,829
But thank you iammonk for the clip.

3502
04:10:58,829 --> 04:11:00,829
Mouse8, thanks for ten bucks. A jewel for your scepter.

3503
04:11:00,829 --> 04:11:02,829
Also examine the scepter with a winky face.

3504
04:11:02,829 --> 04:11:05,260
Thank you mouse8 for the

3505
04:11:05,260 --> 04:11:07,819
tips.

3506
04:11:07,819 --> 04:11:09,819
And the ten bucks. I'm not sad.

3507
04:11:09,819 --> 04:11:12,059
I'm not sad.

3508
04:11:12,059 --> 04:11:14,690
Oh my god another fifty dollars.

3509
04:11:14,690 --> 04:11:16,690
Holy shit.

3510
04:11:16,690 --> 04:11:18,690
Ace Mclase fifty bucks.

3511
04:11:18,690 --> 04:11:20,690
Head pain is the bane of my existence.

3512
04:11:20,690 --> 04:11:22,690
Thanks for the stream Jerma.

3513
04:11:22,690 --> 04:11:26,459
Jerma heart, Jerma heart.

3514
04:11:26,459 --> 04:11:28,459
Yeah, there's one

3515
04:11:28,459 --> 04:11:30,459
thing I really can't

3516
04:11:30,459 --> 04:11:32,459
handle. And it's

3517
04:11:32,459 --> 04:11:34,459
like head pain, like headache.

3518
04:11:34,459 --> 04:11:36,459
It makes anything I do impossible.

3519
04:11:36,459 --> 04:11:39,340
So those of you guys that get

3520
04:11:39,340 --> 04:11:41,340
cluster headaches and migraines and

3521
04:11:41,340 --> 04:11:43,340
headaches a couple times a week.

3522
04:11:43,340 --> 04:11:45,340
I completely feel your pain here.

3523
04:11:45,340 --> 04:11:47,340
I completely understand exactly.

3524
04:11:47,340 --> 04:11:51,760
It sucks.

3525
04:11:51,760 --> 04:11:53,760
Yeah, I know.

3526
04:11:53,760 --> 04:11:55,760
I don't want to play getting over it.

3527
04:11:55,760 --> 04:11:57,760
He's already getting practice. That's not fair.

3528
04:11:57,760 --> 04:12:01,540
How would that be fair at all?

3529
04:12:01,540 --> 04:12:03,540
I don't get the practice in getting over it.

3530
04:12:03,540 --> 04:12:05,540
He's streamed it like twice in a row now.

3531
04:12:05,540 --> 04:12:12,829
We gotta do something that we both have never done.

3532
04:12:12,829 --> 04:12:18,340
Two thanks or worse.

3533
04:12:18,340 --> 04:12:20,340
Yeah, those are really bad too.

3534
04:12:20,340 --> 04:12:22,340
There's a lot, but I don't know.

3535
04:12:22,340 --> 04:12:25,860
It's tough.

3536
04:12:25,860 --> 04:12:29,870
But thank you so much

3537
04:12:29,870 --> 04:12:31,870
to mouse8.

3538
04:12:31,870 --> 04:12:33,870
Thank you smelly boy for the one dollar. I shoveled snow.

3539
04:12:33,870 --> 04:12:37,010
Congratulations on the snow shoveling.

3540
04:12:37,010 --> 04:12:39,010
I haven't seen snow in a while.

3541
04:12:39,010 --> 04:12:41,010
Part of me misses it.

3542
04:12:41,010 --> 04:12:44,129
Part of me misses it.

3543
04:12:44,129 --> 04:12:46,500
Thank you

3544
04:12:46,500 --> 04:12:48,500
yelewa.

3545
04:12:48,500 --> 04:12:50,500
Thank you for the one dollar.

3546
04:12:50,500 --> 04:12:53,379
Robot mentality, thanks for the one dollar.

3547
04:12:53,379 --> 04:12:55,940
Slop shop, thanks for the

3548
04:12:55,940 --> 04:12:57,940
ten bucks. Slop shop.

3549
04:12:57,940 --> 04:12:59,940
Hey Jerma, been a fan of the channel for a while.

3550
04:12:59,940 --> 04:13:01,940
When is the live action Jerma Rumble 2 happening?

3551
04:13:01,940 --> 04:13:05,200
I want it to.

3552
04:13:05,200 --> 04:13:07,819
I don't have a set date.

3553
04:13:07,819 --> 04:13:09,819
I don't have a set date for really anything.

3554
04:13:09,819 --> 04:13:14,299
But it's definitely something I want to do.

3555
04:13:14,299 --> 04:13:16,299
And that would be something that I would want to be actually

3556
04:13:16,299 --> 04:13:18,299
live broadcasted on Twitch

3557
04:13:18,299 --> 04:13:21,059
as an event.

3558
04:13:21,059 --> 04:13:23,940
And really go all out.

3559
04:13:23,940 --> 04:13:25,940
Even more so than I did last time.

3560
04:13:25,940 --> 04:13:27,940
Definitely something I want to do.

3561
04:13:27,940 --> 04:13:31,329
What about the school play?

3562
04:13:31,329 --> 04:13:33,329
That would be a nice precursor, wouldn't it?

3563
04:13:33,329 --> 04:13:35,889
But Slop shop, thank you for the twenty dollars.

3564
04:13:35,889 --> 04:13:37,889
You gave me another ten bucks as well.

3565
04:13:37,889 --> 04:13:40,319
Thank you. Right after that.

3566
04:13:40,319 --> 04:13:42,750
Thank you so much for the twenty dollars.

3567
04:13:42,750 --> 04:13:44,750
Egg Johnson, thanks for the one dollar. Please stop playing.

3568
04:13:44,750 --> 04:13:46,750
I want to go play the game and I can't if you're streaming.

3569
04:13:46,750 --> 04:13:48,750
Also, would you play Fortnite

3570
04:13:48,750 --> 04:13:50,750
if they added you as a playable character? No.

3571
04:13:50,750 --> 04:13:54,909
Hey, well I stopped streaming.

3572
04:13:54,909 --> 04:13:57,280
So you can go play it.

3573
04:13:59,280 --> 04:14:01,280
Hey, you got Egg. Egg Johnson.

3574
04:14:01,280 --> 04:14:04,159
You got your wish. Wish granted.

3575
04:14:04,159 --> 04:14:06,979
But no, I wouldn't play Fortnite

3576
04:14:06,979 --> 04:14:12,219
if I was a playable character.

3577
04:14:12,219 --> 04:14:14,780
I'd be like, oh, that's kind of cool.

3578
04:14:14,780 --> 04:14:17,540
And then I'd say,

3579
04:14:17,540 --> 04:14:19,540
where's my lawyer?

3580
04:14:19,540 --> 04:14:21,840
Then I would just start calling and suing everybody.

3581
04:14:21,840 --> 04:14:25,620
You know how quickly they'd get sued?

3582
04:14:25,620 --> 04:14:32,909
Sue Fortnite.

3583
04:14:32,909 --> 04:14:34,909
Peaceful Haley, thanks for the one dollar.

3584
04:14:34,909 --> 04:14:36,909
Hey Jeremy, just stopped by to say hi.

3585
04:14:36,909 --> 04:14:38,909
And recently, I don't know, I've been so confused

3586
04:14:38,909 --> 04:14:40,909
on what I want to do with my life.

3587
04:14:40,909 --> 04:14:42,909
I mean, I know what to do, I guess,

3588
04:14:42,909 --> 04:14:44,909
but starting is the hardest part.

3589
04:14:44,909 --> 04:14:46,909
I've been streaming, which is fun.

3590
04:14:46,909 --> 04:14:48,909
I'm just trying to go through more creative routes in my life.

3591
04:14:48,909 --> 04:14:50,909
Because all I want in life is to make myself another happy.

3592
04:14:50,909 --> 04:14:52,909
And yeah, I don't want to ramble,

3593
04:14:52,909 --> 04:14:58,219
but thanks for the inspiration.

3594
04:14:58,219 --> 04:15:00,219
I don't want to get creative stuff

3595
04:15:00,219 --> 04:15:02,219
and challenging yourself creatively.

3596
04:15:02,219 --> 04:15:04,219
Creatively? Creatively?

3597
04:15:04,219 --> 04:15:06,219
What the fuck am I saying?

3598
04:15:06,219 --> 04:15:08,530
There's...

3599
04:15:08,530 --> 04:15:11,790
There really is no right answer.

3600
04:15:11,790 --> 04:15:15,700
If you're stuck

3601
04:15:15,700 --> 04:15:17,870
creatively,

3602
04:15:17,870 --> 04:15:19,870
or if you want to go through more creative stuff in your life,

3603
04:15:19,870 --> 04:15:21,870
you kind of have to make it happen.

3604
04:15:21,870 --> 04:15:27,739
You know?

3605
04:15:27,739 --> 04:15:30,239
And he said starting is the hardest part.

3606
04:15:30,239 --> 04:15:32,239
Starting is probably the hardest part,

3607
04:15:32,239 --> 04:15:34,239
but an equally difficult part is

3608
04:15:34,239 --> 04:15:36,239
continuing to do things that you want to do.

3609
04:15:36,239 --> 04:15:38,239
And not letting

3610
04:15:38,239 --> 04:15:40,239
roadblocks get in the way.

3611
04:15:40,239 --> 04:15:43,059
Because they will, it'll happen.

3612
04:15:43,059 --> 04:15:47,069
But you also have to remember that

3613
04:15:47,069 --> 04:15:49,069
you don't have to do something

3614
04:15:49,069 --> 04:15:51,069
just because you think you do.

3615
04:15:51,069 --> 04:15:53,250
You know, there's plenty of things that I

3616
04:15:53,250 --> 04:15:55,250
wanted to do in my life that I didn't do.

3617
04:15:55,250 --> 04:15:57,250
That I wanted to do.

3618
04:15:57,250 --> 04:15:59,549
And you just, you have to make sure

3619
04:15:59,549 --> 04:16:01,549
that you have a few different interests

3620
04:16:01,549 --> 04:16:03,549
so that when at least one of them

3621
04:16:03,549 --> 04:16:08,479
works out, then you're happy.

3622
04:16:08,479 --> 04:16:10,479
Roadblocks in the way.

3623
04:16:10,479 --> 04:16:18,799
But you just want to make sure that you have

3624
04:16:18,799 --> 04:16:20,799
like I said, we've kind of gone over it

3625
04:16:20,799 --> 04:16:22,799
a couple times, and that's my opinion on it is,

3626
04:16:22,799 --> 04:16:24,799
make sure that you have a few interests

3627
04:16:24,799 --> 04:16:27,040
that you would be happy with.

3628
04:16:27,040 --> 04:16:29,469
And pursue them.

3629
04:16:29,469 --> 04:16:31,780
If one sticks, great. Awesome.

3630
04:16:31,780 --> 04:16:34,270
If the others don't, you have

3631
04:16:34,270 --> 04:16:36,270
more than one interest. Right?

3632
04:16:36,270 --> 04:16:38,770
I'm not saying that streaming is one of those things,

3633
04:16:38,770 --> 04:16:44,079
but it could be anything.

3634
04:16:44,079 --> 04:16:46,079
Just become the number one

3635
04:16:46,079 --> 04:16:48,450
roadblocks streamer.

3636
04:16:48,450 --> 04:16:53,489
You can do that.

3637
04:16:53,489 --> 04:16:55,489
But I wish you the best in life,

3638
04:16:55,489 --> 04:16:57,489
I wish you the best luck in whatever you're doing.

3639
04:16:57,489 --> 04:17:02,739
Just try. As long as you try,

3640
04:17:02,739 --> 04:17:04,739
and as long as you have a few things that you like,

3641
04:17:04,739 --> 04:17:07,299
give them all a try.

3642
04:17:07,299 --> 04:17:10,299
You never know. But thank you for the

3643
04:17:10,299 --> 04:17:12,299
$1 Haley. Thank you for the $1 to

3644
04:17:12,299 --> 04:17:14,670
robot mentality. Thank you.

3645
04:17:14,670 --> 04:17:17,100
No message or anything, but

3646
04:17:17,100 --> 04:17:19,280
just a dollar, thank you.

3647
04:17:19,280 --> 04:17:21,280
Getting close to the end here, we've got King of Acorns

3648
04:17:21,280 --> 04:17:23,280
for $5. Hey German, my name is Austin.

3649
04:17:23,280 --> 04:17:25,280
I'm a long time viewer of the streams.

3650
04:17:25,280 --> 04:17:27,280
Thanks for all the laughs. You are awesome.

3651
04:17:27,280 --> 04:17:29,280
Never stop doing what you're doing. Also, can I get

3652
04:17:29,280 --> 04:17:31,280
a birthday shout out? Yeah.

3653
04:17:31,280 --> 04:17:33,899
Happy birthday, King of Acorns.

3654
04:17:33,899 --> 04:17:35,899
Happy 23rd birthday.

3655
04:17:35,899 --> 04:17:39,940
23?

3656
04:17:39,940 --> 04:17:42,239
And then say LOL thanks.

3657
04:17:42,239 --> 04:17:44,239
You're welcome. Hope you have a great one.

3658
04:17:44,239 --> 04:17:48,079
Thank you Smelly Boy for the $1.

3659
04:17:48,079 --> 04:17:50,579
Please explain

3660
04:17:50,579 --> 04:17:53,329
this.

3661
04:17:53,329 --> 04:17:56,719
Breeze frame of

3662
04:17:56,719 --> 04:17:58,719
I don't know what that is. Those are green eyes?

3663
04:17:58,719 --> 04:18:00,719
You doctored that photo.

3664
04:18:00,719 --> 04:18:04,299
Thank you for the $1 though.

3665
04:18:04,299 --> 04:18:08,909
$2 actually.

3666
04:18:08,909 --> 04:18:10,909
Emooch, thanks for the $1. Hey German, much love

3667
04:18:10,909 --> 04:18:13,790
and I'm always happy to support the channel.

3668
04:18:13,790 --> 04:18:17,700
I really appreciate it. Thank you.

3669
04:18:17,700 --> 04:18:20,829
Mail Vallo, thanks for the $4.

3670
04:18:20,829 --> 04:18:22,829
Hey German, recently changed my alias.

3671
04:18:22,829 --> 04:18:24,829
Used to be FGWGWF.

3672
04:18:24,829 --> 04:18:26,829
Not sure if you remember me, I do.

3673
04:18:26,829 --> 04:18:28,829
Figure it was time for an actual username

3674
04:18:28,829 --> 04:18:30,829
and not one

3675
04:18:30,829 --> 04:18:32,829
that I got from slapping

3676
04:18:32,829 --> 04:18:35,139
my keyboard. While on the

3677
04:18:35,139 --> 04:18:37,139
subject, I remember you talking briefly in a TF2

3678
04:18:37,139 --> 04:18:39,139
video like 4 years ago

3679
04:18:39,139 --> 04:18:41,139
how you got your alias. Cause your name

3680
04:18:41,139 --> 04:18:43,440
is Jeremy. Is it inspired

3681
04:18:43,440 --> 04:18:46,000
by anything though?

3682
04:18:46,000 --> 04:18:49,389
No. Just kind of

3683
04:18:49,389 --> 04:18:51,389
easy nickname.

3684
04:18:51,389 --> 04:18:54,459
I was called and

3685
04:18:54,459 --> 04:18:57,600
kind of just stuck. But thank you for the

3686
04:18:57,600 --> 04:18:59,600
$4.

3687
04:18:59,600 --> 04:19:03,059
Great name change. Hey Tingy,

3688
04:19:03,059 --> 04:19:05,059
thanks for $2. Hey, here's $2 for express

3689
04:19:05,059 --> 04:19:07,059
shipping on those shirts. If you

3690
04:19:07,059 --> 04:19:09,059
can give Teespring a call and let them know I paid

3691
04:19:09,059 --> 04:19:14,049
extra. That would be nice.

3692
04:19:14,049 --> 04:19:16,049
I'm not in control of the shipping.

3693
04:19:16,049 --> 04:19:18,540
That will be on Teespring.

3694
04:19:18,540 --> 04:19:20,540
Freudian weapon, thanks for the $3. Not sure if this was

3695
04:19:20,540 --> 04:19:22,540
brought up, but your headaches might be caused by straining your

3696
04:19:22,540 --> 04:19:24,540
eyes on the screen. Have you considered getting

3697
04:19:24,540 --> 04:19:26,540
your eyes checked? Feel better, man.

3698
04:19:26,540 --> 04:19:29,040
Ah, but first of all, thanks for the $3.

3699
04:19:29,040 --> 04:19:31,040
Second of all, I've had my eyes checked. I had an eye

3700
04:19:31,040 --> 04:19:33,040
exam last year. Everything

3701
04:19:33,040 --> 04:19:35,040
is good to go. It's...

3702
04:19:35,040 --> 04:19:37,040
I've had headaches my whole life.

3703
04:19:37,040 --> 04:19:39,219
I actually got

3704
04:19:39,219 --> 04:19:41,219
diagnosed with migraines. I had to take

3705
04:19:41,219 --> 04:19:43,219
Imitrex for a little while.

3706
04:19:43,219 --> 04:19:45,219
I had an Imitrex nasal spray.

3707
04:19:45,219 --> 04:19:47,709
But I didn't like taking it anymore.

3708
04:19:47,709 --> 04:19:50,340
I didn't like what it did.

3709
04:19:50,340 --> 04:19:52,340
So... last year?

3710
04:19:52,340 --> 04:19:54,340
Well, I mean, it's 2019. I'm talking

3711
04:19:54,340 --> 04:19:56,340
like 2018, probably like

3712
04:19:56,340 --> 04:19:58,340
four or five months ago.

3713
04:19:58,340 --> 04:20:03,329
But, yeah,

3714
04:20:03,329 --> 04:20:05,329
it's just something that happens sometimes.

3715
04:20:05,329 --> 04:20:07,329
And I've had...

3716
04:20:07,329 --> 04:20:09,329
I've had like CT scans of my head to make sure

3717
04:20:09,329 --> 04:20:13,680
there's nothing really going on.

3718
04:20:13,680 --> 04:20:15,680
But it might be worth another conversation because

3719
04:20:15,680 --> 04:20:22,590
it's really annoying.

3720
04:20:22,590 --> 04:20:25,020
Spray gets you high.

3721
04:20:25,020 --> 04:20:27,020
No, it just like shuts you off. It's weird.

3722
04:20:27,020 --> 04:20:31,120
And when I would do...

3723
04:20:31,120 --> 04:20:33,120
When I would get a bad migraine and I would

3724
04:20:33,120 --> 04:20:35,120
do Imitrex, you're supposed to do it right when the headache comes on.

3725
04:20:35,120 --> 04:20:37,120
Right at the onset of a real migraine,

3726
04:20:37,120 --> 04:20:39,120
you're supposed to do it.

3727
04:20:39,120 --> 04:20:41,120
But, man, it would shut me off for like four days.

3728
04:20:41,120 --> 04:20:43,120
I would be just

3729
04:20:43,120 --> 04:20:45,489
turned the fuck off.

3730
04:20:45,489 --> 04:20:47,489
Groggy, messed up, sloppy,

3731
04:20:47,489 --> 04:20:49,489
slippery. I would be for like at least

3732
04:20:49,489 --> 04:20:51,790
three or four days. I hated it.

3733
04:20:51,790 --> 04:20:59,020
But, do not

3734
04:20:59,020 --> 04:21:02,350
be concerned. I know that sometimes

3735
04:21:02,350 --> 04:21:04,350
when I talk about medical stuff, people go

3736
04:21:04,350 --> 04:21:06,350
oh, fuck, are you alright?

3737
04:21:06,350 --> 04:21:08,350
I'm just like, no, I'm fine, I'm fine. Don't worry.

3738
04:21:08,350 --> 04:21:13,010
Don't worry about me.

3739
04:21:13,010 --> 04:21:17,360
Everything's gonna be just fine. But thank you,

3740
04:21:17,360 --> 04:21:19,360
Frodeon. Thank you, robot mentality for the one dollar.

3741
04:21:19,360 --> 04:21:21,360
Thank you, Kinky

3742
04:21:21,360 --> 04:21:23,360
Lil Poo Poo for the five

3743
04:21:23,360 --> 04:21:26,049
dollars. I'm gonna...

3744
04:21:26,049 --> 04:21:28,049
I can't laugh at that. I don't know what that is.

3745
04:21:28,049 --> 04:21:30,049
I don't know what that means. What the fuck did I just read?

3746
04:21:30,049 --> 04:21:32,049
Thank you for the five dollars. Thank you, Keldos

3747
04:21:32,049 --> 04:21:34,049
for the one dollar.

3748
04:21:34,049 --> 04:21:40,510
I swear this is not a gnome.

3749
04:21:40,510 --> 04:21:48,770
It's a Vinesauce animated thing.

3750
04:21:48,770 --> 04:21:52,290
Clip it.

3751
04:21:52,290 --> 04:21:54,290
That's a Vinny animated

3752
04:21:54,290 --> 04:21:57,739
geese. You wanna hear it again?

3753
04:21:57,739 --> 04:22:07,469
Alright, here's the whole video.

3754
04:22:07,469 --> 04:22:09,469
The video's like two minutes long.

3755
04:22:09,469 --> 04:22:12,350
I'm just kidding. But thank you for the video.

3756
04:22:12,350 --> 04:22:15,940
Thank you, Kinky

3757
04:22:15,940 --> 04:22:17,940
for the one dollar. I forgot to send a link

3758
04:22:17,940 --> 04:22:19,940
but I clipped the video of you killing a dog

3759
04:22:19,940 --> 04:22:21,940
and uploading it. What?

3760
04:22:21,940 --> 04:22:24,110
Oh, talking about in the game.

3761
04:22:24,110 --> 04:22:31,649
What the fuck?

3762
04:22:31,649 --> 04:22:33,649
This is like

3763
04:22:33,649 --> 04:22:35,649
a broken link. I can't even click this.

3764
04:22:35,649 --> 04:22:37,889
There's like five

3765
04:22:37,889 --> 04:22:48,260
spaces in here.

3766
04:22:48,260 --> 04:22:50,260
Why did you type W space W?

3767
04:22:50,260 --> 04:22:52,260
Why did you do all the spaces?

3768
04:22:52,260 --> 04:23:02,940
W space

3769
04:23:02,940 --> 04:23:06,590
W.

3770
04:23:06,590 --> 04:23:08,590
So what is this?

3771
04:23:08,590 --> 04:23:10,590
What the hell did you just give me as a link here?

3772
04:23:10,590 --> 04:23:13,979
You put a space between you

3773
04:23:13,979 --> 04:23:19,940
and two. You guys wanna know

3774
04:23:19,940 --> 04:23:21,940
what it was? What do you think it was?

3775
04:23:21,940 --> 04:23:23,940
Yeah.

3776
04:23:23,940 --> 04:23:29,250
Yeah.

3777
04:23:29,250 --> 04:23:31,250
That's like next level.

3778
04:23:31,250 --> 04:23:33,870
Alright, thank you for the dollar.

3779
04:23:33,870 --> 04:23:35,870
Thank you, Dr. Zoot Suit for the one dollar.

3780
04:23:35,870 --> 04:23:37,870
Jeremiah, I finished drawing female you.

3781
04:23:37,870 --> 04:23:41,579
I have sinned.

3782
04:23:41,579 --> 04:23:43,579
Thank you for the one dollar. Thank you, Lord Muffins for the one dollar.

3783
04:23:43,579 --> 04:23:45,579
Hey Jeremiah, I've been a fan for 25 years.

3784
04:23:45,579 --> 04:23:47,579
I would love it if you

3785
04:23:47,579 --> 04:23:52,510
would light by...

3786
04:23:52,510 --> 04:23:54,510
I'm not doing either of those things. Thank you for the one dollar,

3787
04:23:54,510 --> 04:23:56,879
Lord Muffin. Wizard Ribbit,

3788
04:23:56,879 --> 04:23:58,879
thanks for the one dollar. I need to wear Gunner Optics

3789
04:23:58,879 --> 04:24:00,879
to avoid gamer headache.

3790
04:24:00,879 --> 04:24:05,229
No, that's not what it is.

3791
04:24:05,229 --> 04:24:07,229
Thank you, though. Thank you, Jess, for the one dollar.

3792
04:24:07,229 --> 04:24:09,229
I've been keeping a library of all the sounds you've made

3793
04:24:09,229 --> 04:24:11,229
since the start of the year.

3794
04:24:11,229 --> 04:24:13,229
I was gonna keep it all...

3795
04:24:13,229 --> 04:24:15,229
I was gonna keep it up all year, but it's actually way more than

3796
04:24:15,229 --> 04:24:17,229
I thought. I have 270 sounds.

3797
04:24:17,229 --> 04:24:22,989
That's too many sounds.

3798
04:24:22,989 --> 04:24:25,739
That's more sounds than are in

3799
04:24:25,739 --> 04:24:29,649
the Star Wars trilogy.

3800
04:24:29,649 --> 04:24:38,290
Dermatantrum, what is this?

3801
04:24:38,290 --> 04:24:43,069
Eugh! Eugh! Eugh!

3802
04:24:43,069 --> 04:24:45,700
Eugh! Eugh!

3803
04:24:45,700 --> 04:24:47,700
That was pretty fucking close. I haven't heard that

3804
04:24:47,700 --> 04:24:49,700
since the stream. That was really close. That was really

3805
04:24:49,700 --> 04:24:53,020
good. That was on the spot.

3806
04:24:53,020 --> 04:24:55,020
No practice.

3807
04:24:55,020 --> 04:25:03,709
But thank you, though, Jess. Thank you

3808
04:25:03,709 --> 04:25:05,709
something or other for the one dollar. EuroGerms,

3809
04:25:05,709 --> 04:25:07,709
I apologize. This one hasn't come up before.

3810
04:25:07,709 --> 04:25:09,709
Would you ever consider doing a Germa Rumble with

3811
04:25:09,709 --> 04:25:11,709
community submitted characters and bios?

3812
04:25:11,709 --> 04:25:13,709
Seems like a train wreck.

3813
04:25:13,709 --> 04:25:16,079
Um...

3814
04:25:16,079 --> 04:25:21,069
Probably not. Probably not like a community

3815
04:25:21,069 --> 04:25:23,069
rumble. Because that...

3816
04:25:23,069 --> 04:25:26,020
I think that would get a little messy.

3817
04:25:26,020 --> 04:25:28,020
Great Canadian FK Club, thanks for five more

3818
04:25:28,020 --> 04:25:33,389
community subs. On top of the

3819
04:25:33,389 --> 04:25:35,389
countless amount that you currently

3820
04:25:35,389 --> 04:25:37,389
have, thank you so much.

3821
04:25:37,389 --> 04:25:39,389
But a community rumble

3822
04:25:39,389 --> 04:25:41,389
would get messy for the same reasons

3823
04:25:41,389 --> 04:25:43,389
that I think a lot of stuff like that has a tendency to get

3824
04:25:43,389 --> 04:25:45,760
messy. Because

3825
04:25:45,760 --> 04:25:47,760
let's say that there was, you know, ten contestants

3826
04:25:47,760 --> 04:25:49,760
or like five, twenty contestants or something that

3827
04:25:49,760 --> 04:25:53,090
I would be accepting.

3828
04:25:53,090 --> 04:25:55,090
You know, not picking somebody's

3829
04:25:55,090 --> 04:25:57,090
if there's like hundreds of entries.

3830
04:25:57,090 --> 04:25:59,090
I don't

3831
04:25:59,090 --> 04:26:01,090
want to make it like a competition.

3832
04:26:01,090 --> 04:26:04,350
The emote contest was the last real

3833
04:26:04,350 --> 04:26:06,350
competition in quotes.

3834
04:26:06,350 --> 04:26:09,040
And it was

3835
04:26:09,040 --> 04:26:12,430
handled pretty well.

3836
04:26:12,430 --> 04:26:14,430
But I don't want to like make a whole

3837
04:26:14,430 --> 04:26:21,920
lot of competitions. Mod

3838
04:26:21,920 --> 04:26:27,360
Rumble. But it's an interesting

3839
04:26:27,360 --> 04:26:30,180
idea. But I don't want to have a

3840
04:26:30,180 --> 04:26:32,180
situation where it's like, you

3841
04:26:32,180 --> 04:26:34,180
picked this and not mine? What the fuck?

3842
04:26:34,180 --> 04:26:36,180
That one sucks! And then people get angry

3843
04:26:36,180 --> 04:26:38,180
and you're like, well, uh...

3844
04:26:38,180 --> 04:26:41,629
Stuff like that is hard to make

3845
04:26:41,629 --> 04:26:50,209
everybody happy. And I've learned a lot

3846
04:26:50,209 --> 04:26:52,209
over the years.

3847
04:26:52,209 --> 04:26:54,209
Trying to get them to do it, trying to get it to happen

3848
04:26:54,209 --> 04:26:56,209
the right way. And how would I want to do

3849
04:26:56,209 --> 04:26:58,209
stuff like that? I've done it a couple times.

3850
04:26:58,209 --> 04:27:03,969
But I do like the idea.

3851
04:27:03,969 --> 04:27:06,780
Just the execution would need to be done correctly.

3852
04:27:06,780 --> 04:27:09,090
But thank you.

3853
04:27:09,090 --> 04:27:12,290
Thank you to

3854
04:27:12,290 --> 04:27:14,290
Guido for the one dollar.

3855
04:27:14,290 --> 04:27:16,459
I used to get those headaches a bunch too. Went away

3856
04:27:16,459 --> 04:27:18,459
after I got these glasses that help the

3857
04:27:18,459 --> 04:27:20,459
eye strain. Maybe you should try

3858
04:27:20,459 --> 04:27:22,899
it. I mean, it's worth a shot.

3859
04:27:22,899 --> 04:27:24,899
I think a long time

3860
04:27:24,899 --> 04:27:26,899
ago when I was doing YouTube and sitting

3861
04:27:26,899 --> 04:27:28,899
in front of a screen for a long time,

3862
04:27:28,899 --> 04:27:30,899
it did help to wear, like,

3863
04:27:30,899 --> 04:27:32,899
to have, like, flux on or have,

3864
04:27:32,899 --> 04:27:34,899
like, optics on.

3865
04:27:34,899 --> 04:27:36,899
Maybe I'll go back to doing it again.

3866
04:27:36,899 --> 04:27:42,590
But I do appreciate it. Thank you.

3867
04:27:42,590 --> 04:27:44,590
Flying Sombrero, thanks for the one dollar.

3868
04:27:44,590 --> 04:27:46,590
Hey Jerma, I was talking with this girl I recently met

3869
04:27:46,590 --> 04:27:48,590
about our favorite YouTubers and streamers.

3870
04:27:48,590 --> 04:27:50,590
I mentioned that you were my favorite streamer and she

3871
04:27:50,590 --> 04:27:53,219
stopped talking to me. Thanks.

3872
04:27:53,219 --> 04:27:55,219
Well, good. Because that

3873
04:27:55,219 --> 04:27:57,219
wasn't a keeper.

3874
04:27:57,219 --> 04:28:09,870
You know what I'm saying? Thank you

3875
04:28:09,870 --> 04:28:13,200
for the one dollar. Thank you, Mom

3876
04:28:13,200 --> 04:28:15,200
the Peach for the one dollar. Sub

3877
04:28:15,200 --> 04:28:17,200
today and looking forward to the future. Hope your head feels better.

3878
04:28:17,200 --> 04:28:19,200
Thank you. Appreciate that.

3879
04:28:19,200 --> 04:28:22,139
I'm gonna take some Advil and just

3880
04:28:22,139 --> 04:28:24,139
relax. And we're gonna try again tomorrow.

3881
04:28:24,139 --> 04:28:27,790
Krusty Earwax, thanks for the one dollar.

3882
04:28:27,790 --> 04:28:29,790
I don't know if referencing Jojo's Bizarre Adventure

3883
04:28:29,790 --> 04:28:31,790
is still a joke, but you should play

3884
04:28:31,790 --> 04:28:33,790
one of the shitty Jojo games and then they

3885
04:28:33,790 --> 04:28:35,790
do like the, I don't know, but whatever.

3886
04:28:35,790 --> 04:28:41,229
There was one on Dreamcast that I

3887
04:28:41,229 --> 04:28:43,229
hovered over the purchase button and realized that it got

3888
04:28:43,229 --> 04:28:45,229
afforded. I'm not kidding.

3889
04:28:45,229 --> 04:28:47,979
Didn't buy it though.

3890
04:28:47,979 --> 04:28:49,979
Thank you, Awesome Stevie for the one dollar.

3891
04:28:49,979 --> 04:28:51,979
Okay, you are epic.

3892
04:28:51,979 --> 04:28:55,420
Thank you. Dr. Clay,

3893
04:28:55,420 --> 04:28:57,420
thanks for the one dollar. We talked about Joel

3894
04:28:57,420 --> 04:28:59,420
challenging me. I already accepted the challenge.

3895
04:29:01,420 --> 04:29:03,420
InvaderZ, thanks for the two bucks.

3896
04:29:03,420 --> 04:29:05,420
I was finally able to make a stream. Thank you

3897
04:29:05,420 --> 04:29:07,420
so much, Jerma. You're awesome and you always make me laugh.

3898
04:29:07,420 --> 04:29:10,559
Welcome to the stream.

3899
04:29:10,559 --> 04:29:12,559
Glad you made it. Sorry, it was a short one.

3900
04:29:12,559 --> 04:29:15,500
Thank you, Breenland for the one dollar.

3901
04:29:15,500 --> 04:29:17,500
Hey yo, are you gonna play Kingdom Hearts 1, 2, and 3?

3902
04:29:19,680 --> 04:29:21,680
I'd say all of them, but it'd never

3903
04:29:21,680 --> 04:29:24,500
finish.

3904
04:29:24,500 --> 04:29:26,500
No, that's like 6,000 hours.

3905
04:29:26,500 --> 04:29:29,500
I don't think I'm gonna play Kingdom Hearts 3

3906
04:29:29,500 --> 04:29:31,809
on stream or 1 or 2.

3907
04:29:31,809 --> 04:29:33,809
But I hope you enjoy it when it releases in

3908
04:29:35,809 --> 04:29:37,809
like less than 24 hours.

3909
04:29:37,809 --> 04:29:39,809
So, have a great playthrough of Kingdom Hearts 3.

3910
04:29:39,809 --> 04:29:45,950
I heard it's pretty good.

3911
04:29:45,950 --> 04:29:49,409
Thank you for the suggestion,

3912
04:29:49,409 --> 04:29:51,409
but probably not on this channel.

3913
04:29:51,409 --> 04:29:53,899
Hey Tingy, thanks for the two bucks. I see how this is

3914
04:29:53,899 --> 04:29:55,899
gonna happen. Sliding more bits under the table.

3915
04:29:55,899 --> 04:29:58,459
Will this do, Wink? You can't pay me to do

3916
04:29:58,459 --> 04:30:02,879
anything. Thank you, DoubleD for the one

3917
04:30:02,879 --> 04:30:04,879
dollar. Hey Jerma, could you please assist me in identifying

3918
04:30:04,879 --> 04:30:06,879
this man? He's been

3919
04:30:06,879 --> 04:30:08,879
tormenting me for months. He keeps

3920
04:30:08,879 --> 04:30:10,879
rambling on something about playing Army of Two with his

3921
04:30:10,879 --> 04:30:12,879
college. It's a picture of italics.

3922
04:30:12,879 --> 04:30:16,340
Thank you. Subwab,

3923
04:30:16,340 --> 04:30:18,340
thank you for the ten dollars.

3924
04:30:18,340 --> 04:30:21,340
Jerma, figuring out the

3925
04:30:21,340 --> 04:30:23,340
person I want to be in life has been difficult, but I want to let you

3926
04:30:23,340 --> 04:30:25,340
know you've been a huge inspiration.

3927
04:30:25,340 --> 04:30:27,340
You're a real hero to me, so thanks for all the good times.

3928
04:30:27,340 --> 04:30:30,290
If I can inspire somebody

3929
04:30:30,290 --> 04:30:32,850
to do anything positive,

3930
04:30:32,850 --> 04:30:35,020
then I'm

3931
04:30:35,020 --> 04:30:37,020
fucking honored. Thank you.

3932
04:30:37,020 --> 04:30:39,649
Thank you for even saying

3933
04:30:39,649 --> 04:30:41,649
that. I hope

3934
04:30:41,649 --> 04:30:43,649
you, whatever you take from

3935
04:30:43,649 --> 04:30:45,649
me, whatever that is,

3936
04:30:45,649 --> 04:30:48,020
hope you have it positively affect your

3937
04:30:48,020 --> 04:30:50,020
life. Seriously, thank you.

3938
04:30:50,020 --> 04:30:52,579
And thank you for the ten dollars.

3939
04:30:52,579 --> 04:30:55,709
Thank you Dr. Plato

3940
04:30:55,709 --> 04:30:57,709
for the one dollar. Don't know if you're

3941
04:30:57,709 --> 04:30:59,709
going to see this, but I've had constant headaches and migraines

3942
04:30:59,709 --> 04:31:01,709
recently. Currently in the Navy,

3943
04:31:01,709 --> 04:31:03,709
so it's straining. I get where you're

3944
04:31:03,709 --> 04:31:05,709
coming from and getting headaches every day is so hard to deal

3945
04:31:05,709 --> 04:31:07,709
with. I've gotten an MRI, but came back clean.

3946
04:31:07,709 --> 04:31:09,709
I honestly don't know what to do about it.

3947
04:31:09,709 --> 04:31:12,510
Yeah, for me,

3948
04:31:12,510 --> 04:31:14,510
they come in like strings.

3949
04:31:14,510 --> 04:31:17,899
Like I will go to bed with a headache, wake up

3950
04:31:17,899 --> 04:31:19,899
groggy and fucked up and feel like

3951
04:31:19,899 --> 04:31:21,899
slow and headache-y.

3952
04:31:21,899 --> 04:31:23,899
And then another day, like it's

3953
04:31:23,899 --> 04:31:25,899
like an eye pain headache, and then

3954
04:31:25,899 --> 04:31:27,899
like a back of the head headache, and then it's gone for

3955
04:31:27,899 --> 04:31:29,899
three months. It's weird.

3956
04:31:29,899 --> 04:31:32,459
I feel like I'm currently like in the

3957
04:31:32,459 --> 04:31:36,620
thick of that right now.

3958
04:31:36,620 --> 04:31:38,620
But I'm really sorry to hear about your struggles

3959
04:31:38,620 --> 04:31:40,620
there. Hopefully you can

3960
04:31:40,620 --> 04:31:42,620
figure out some kind of solution.

3961
04:31:42,620 --> 04:31:44,620
Because it sucks. It does. It's annoying.

3962
04:31:44,620 --> 04:31:50,370
I wish you the best. Thank you for the

3963
04:31:50,370 --> 04:31:52,540
one dollar. Only a few more

3964
04:31:52,540 --> 04:31:54,540
here. Thank you Solid Milk for the one dollar. Hey Jeremy,

3965
04:31:54,540 --> 04:31:56,540
I'm wondering, should I ask a girl I've been friend-

3966
04:31:56,540 --> 04:31:58,540
Should I try to ask a girl I've been friends with

3967
04:31:58,540 --> 04:32:00,540
out for a while? Wait, hold on.

3968
04:32:00,540 --> 04:32:02,540
Hold on, let me read this again.

3969
04:32:02,540 --> 04:32:04,540
I've been wondering if I should try to ask a girl I've

3970
04:32:04,540 --> 04:32:06,540
been friends with for a while.

3971
04:32:06,540 --> 04:32:08,540
But I don't want to ruin our friendship.

3972
04:32:08,540 --> 04:32:10,540
Oh, okay. So you ask a girl out

3973
04:32:10,540 --> 04:32:13,549
that you've been friends with for a while.

3974
04:32:13,549 --> 04:32:16,239
I don't know. I

3975
04:32:16,239 --> 04:32:18,610
can't give you an answer there. Because I have

3976
04:32:18,610 --> 04:32:20,610
no idea what your relationship is like.

3977
04:32:20,610 --> 04:32:22,610
I don't know how long you've known

3978
04:32:22,610 --> 04:32:24,610
this person. It's very different. Plus I'm terrible

3979
04:32:24,610 --> 04:32:26,610
with relationship advice.

3980
04:32:26,610 --> 04:32:28,610
I'm probably one of the- I'm definitely not somebody

3981
04:32:28,610 --> 04:32:30,610
good to ask stuff like

3982
04:32:30,610 --> 04:32:35,409
this. Don't- remember

3983
04:32:35,409 --> 04:32:37,409
to make sure not to tell her that you know me. That you like

3984
04:32:37,409 --> 04:32:39,409
not know me, but that you watch me.

3985
04:32:39,409 --> 04:32:42,159
You saw how well that goes.

3986
04:32:42,159 --> 04:32:48,110
But without being able to gauge kind of

3987
04:32:48,110 --> 04:32:50,110
the whole situation, it'd be really easy for

3988
04:32:50,110 --> 04:32:52,110
me to be like, yeah, go for it.

3989
04:32:52,110 --> 04:32:54,350
But I have no idea.

3990
04:32:54,350 --> 04:32:56,350
And I don't want to be the person that gives you the wrong

3991
04:32:56,350 --> 04:32:58,350
info. And then it's like,

3992
04:32:58,350 --> 04:33:00,350
why the fuck did Jerma tell me to do that?

3993
04:33:00,350 --> 04:33:03,549
So I'm not really that great with

3994
04:33:03,549 --> 04:33:06,500
relationship advice.

3995
04:33:06,500 --> 04:33:10,020
I do wish you luck

3996
04:33:10,020 --> 04:33:12,450
in your

3997
04:33:12,450 --> 04:33:16,990
romantic endeavors.

3998
04:33:16,990 --> 04:33:18,990
But remember, if somebody wants to just be friends,

3999
04:33:18,990 --> 04:33:20,990
if you figure that out,

4000
04:33:20,990 --> 04:33:24,240
and that's, you know, you-

4001
04:33:24,240 --> 04:33:26,240
I know people that have-

4002
04:33:26,240 --> 04:33:28,240
you gotta be careful because there- I've known

4003
04:33:28,240 --> 04:33:30,240
people before where they were friends for a long

4004
04:33:30,240 --> 04:33:32,240
time, and then somebody tried to

4005
04:33:32,240 --> 04:33:34,240
put the, you know, the line out there.

4006
04:33:34,240 --> 04:33:36,240
They're like, hey, let's-

4007
04:33:36,240 --> 04:33:38,240
maybe we could be more than just friends. And then it

4008
04:33:38,240 --> 04:33:40,240
makes it awkward and they-

4009
04:33:40,240 --> 04:33:42,240
you go apart. So

4010
04:33:42,240 --> 04:33:44,240
that's possible. I mean, it depends on what your friendship

4011
04:33:44,240 --> 04:33:46,240
is like, but you just have to be careful.

4012
04:33:46,240 --> 04:33:54,430
My Tinder

4013
04:33:54,430 --> 04:33:56,430
pick-up line is, hey, baby, you watch

4014
04:33:56,430 --> 04:33:58,430
Jerma985. He beat Demon

4015
04:33:58,430 --> 04:34:00,430
Souls, Dark Souls, and Dark Souls 3.

4016
04:34:00,430 --> 04:34:08,049
No, but I- I wish

4017
04:34:08,049 --> 04:34:10,049
I could give you better advice, but there are much

4018
04:34:10,049 --> 04:34:12,049
better resources than me.

4019
04:34:12,049 --> 04:34:14,860
But thank you, though. Good luck.

4020
04:34:14,860 --> 04:34:17,360
Thank you, UpQuark, for the one dollar.

4021
04:34:17,360 --> 04:34:19,360
Uh, sorry for a downer.

4022
04:34:19,360 --> 04:34:21,360
I wanted to share with you a picture of my dog and I. She recently

4023
04:34:21,360 --> 04:34:23,360
passed away and couldn't miss her more.

4024
04:34:23,360 --> 04:34:25,360
Please, everyone, pet

4025
04:34:25,360 --> 04:34:27,360
your pet whenever you can.

4026
04:34:27,360 --> 04:34:34,830
I'm really sorry to hear that.

4027
04:34:34,830 --> 04:34:36,830
It's really fucking impossible to

4028
04:34:36,830 --> 04:34:39,200
lose an animal.

4029
04:34:39,200 --> 04:34:43,619
I think you've got a picture here of

4030
04:34:45,619 --> 04:34:47,860
this is a photo of the dog.

4031
04:34:47,860 --> 04:35:00,619
Let's take a look.

4032
04:35:00,619 --> 04:35:02,799
Is it a Golden Retriever?

4033
04:35:02,799 --> 04:35:13,150
No, she's beautiful.

4034
04:35:13,150 --> 04:35:15,150
I'm really sorry to hear about that.

4035
04:35:15,150 --> 04:35:17,650
Bad as she was.

4036
04:35:23,520 --> 04:35:28,000
I'm really sorry to hear that.

4037
04:35:28,000 --> 04:35:30,750
Take care of yourself. Much love to you.

4038
04:35:30,750 --> 04:35:32,750
And, uh, I don't know what

4039
04:35:32,750 --> 04:35:34,750
your dog's name was, but

4040
04:35:34,750 --> 04:35:40,259
rest in peace, for sure.

4041
04:35:40,259 --> 04:35:43,709
Thank you for the one dollar, UpQuark.

4042
04:35:43,709 --> 04:35:45,709
Also, thank you to Chubby Funster for the one dollar.

4043
04:35:45,709 --> 04:35:48,080
Hey, Jerma, you're really cute and funny.

4044
04:35:48,080 --> 04:35:50,080
How come you don't grow out your beard?

4045
04:35:50,080 --> 04:35:52,080
You'd look really good with one, I think,

4046
04:35:52,080 --> 04:35:54,080
unless you got something against beards, which I don't think I could

4047
04:35:54,080 --> 04:35:56,080
support a beard-hating streamer if that were the case.

4048
04:35:56,080 --> 04:35:58,770
Love you lots.

4049
04:35:58,770 --> 04:36:00,770
Uh, no, my facial

4050
04:36:00,770 --> 04:36:02,770
hair doesn't grow out full.

4051
04:36:02,770 --> 04:36:04,770
It's bad. It looks like shit.

4052
04:36:04,770 --> 04:36:06,770
It's very patchy and scraggly.

4053
04:36:06,770 --> 04:36:08,770
It's not full, it looks bad.

4054
04:36:08,770 --> 04:36:10,770
That's why I never do it.

4055
04:36:10,770 --> 04:36:12,770
But thank you.

4056
04:36:12,770 --> 04:36:14,770
Thank you, Nebula Brand, for the fifteen dollars.

4057
04:36:14,770 --> 04:36:16,770
Fifteen.

4058
04:36:16,770 --> 04:36:19,650
Thank you.

4059
04:36:19,650 --> 04:36:21,650
Hey, Jerma, I just want to say that even though we've never met,

4060
04:36:21,650 --> 04:36:23,650
watching your streams always feels like hanging out with an old friend.

4061
04:36:23,650 --> 04:36:25,650
2018 was a hard year for me

4062
04:36:25,650 --> 04:36:27,650
for a lot of reasons.

4063
04:36:27,650 --> 04:36:29,650
But even when I only had twenty bucks in my bank account,

4064
04:36:29,650 --> 04:36:31,650
I couldn't unsub from you.

4065
04:36:31,650 --> 04:36:33,650
I don't know how I would have gotten through the second half of 2018

4066
04:36:33,650 --> 04:36:35,650
if I didn't have your streams to come home to

4067
04:36:35,650 --> 04:36:37,650
every other day.

4068
04:36:37,650 --> 04:36:39,650
Thank you for bringing so much laughter to my life.

4069
04:36:39,650 --> 04:36:41,650
And here's to a much happier 2019.

4070
04:36:41,650 --> 04:36:43,650
Hell yeah.

4071
04:36:43,650 --> 04:36:46,020
Here's to 2019.

4072
04:36:46,020 --> 04:36:49,790
Thank you so much, Nebula Brand.

4073
04:36:49,790 --> 04:36:53,310
I'm really sorry to hear about your

4074
04:36:53,310 --> 04:36:59,709
struggles. Much love to you.

4075
04:36:59,709 --> 04:37:02,340
Thank you for everything.

4076
04:37:02,340 --> 04:37:04,639
Thanks for sticking around. I hope you have

4077
04:37:04,639 --> 04:37:06,639
a solid 2019.

4078
04:37:06,639 --> 04:37:13,150
Thank you.

4079
04:37:13,150 --> 04:37:15,150
Thank you, Wizard Ribbit, for the two bucks.

4080
04:37:15,150 --> 04:37:17,150
Drink some brain fluid for a healthy

4081
04:37:17,150 --> 04:37:19,580
brain.

4082
04:37:19,580 --> 04:37:23,740
It probably gives you headaches.

4083
04:37:23,740 --> 04:37:25,740
Tinging thanks for the two bucks. Man, you're one tough customer.

4084
04:37:25,740 --> 04:37:27,740
Wait, I'm the customer.

4085
04:37:27,740 --> 04:37:29,740
What the hell's going on here? Fine, I'll just have them...

4086
04:37:29,740 --> 04:37:31,740
I'll just have to get them the good, old-fashioned

4087
04:37:31,740 --> 04:37:33,740
American way?

4088
04:37:33,740 --> 04:37:37,380
No.

4089
04:37:37,380 --> 04:37:39,380
Thank you, Dr. Zoot Suit for the one dollar.

4090
04:37:39,380 --> 04:37:41,939
I realize I didn't have the link.

4091
04:37:41,939 --> 04:37:45,779
What is this? The link of what?

4092
04:37:45,779 --> 04:37:52,049
Oh, oh, okay.

4093
04:37:52,049 --> 04:37:54,049
Alright, oh.

4094
04:37:54,049 --> 04:37:56,419
Right. Oh.

4095
04:37:56,419 --> 04:37:58,659
Well, alright.

4096
04:37:58,659 --> 04:38:02,750
There it is. Thank you, Dr. Zoot Suit

4097
04:38:02,750 --> 04:38:04,750
for the one dollar. You mean machine for the two bucks.

4098
04:38:04,750 --> 04:38:06,750
Solid Milk, one dollar.

4099
04:38:06,750 --> 04:38:09,119
I fucked up the grammar, but thanks.

4100
04:38:09,119 --> 04:38:11,119
I'll be sure to tell her I watched you.

4101
04:38:11,119 --> 04:38:15,389
Oh god.

4102
04:38:15,389 --> 04:38:17,389
Thank you for the one dollar, Solid Milk.

4103
04:38:17,389 --> 04:38:19,389
Good luck.

4104
04:38:19,389 --> 04:38:21,759
Thank you to...

4105
04:38:21,759 --> 04:38:23,759
Thank you, Django, for the five dollars.

4106
04:38:23,759 --> 04:38:25,759
You're a good guy, Jerma. Thanks for all the

4107
04:38:25,759 --> 04:38:27,759
streams. Have a good night. You as well.

4108
04:38:27,759 --> 04:38:29,759
Thank you so much for the five dollars.

4109
04:38:29,759 --> 04:38:32,750
Appreciate the kind words.

4110
04:38:32,750 --> 04:38:34,750
Double D, thanks for the one dollar. Please share this photo

4111
04:38:34,750 --> 04:38:36,750
with the stream and anyone who sees this must have to report

4112
04:38:36,750 --> 04:38:38,750
it's just...

4113
04:38:38,750 --> 04:38:41,380
It's Italics again.

4114
04:38:41,380 --> 04:38:44,450
What are you doing?

4115
04:38:44,450 --> 04:38:46,450
He's 1200 Jerma bucks

4116
04:38:46,450 --> 04:38:48,450
for the... Italics was last seen on the Vegas

4117
04:38:48,450 --> 04:38:50,450
strip with an extremely short streamer. That's

4118
04:38:50,450 --> 04:38:52,450
very, very... That's not probably more than me.

4119
04:38:52,450 --> 04:38:54,450
But there are plenty of other streamers

4120
04:38:54,450 --> 04:38:56,450
that this could be who are small.

4121
04:38:56,450 --> 04:38:58,450
Not me, though. I'm average small.

4122
04:38:58,450 --> 04:39:00,450
I'm small, but I'm small. I'm average.

4123
04:39:00,450 --> 04:39:02,450
Alright, I'm gonna get out of here. Thank you

4124
04:39:02,450 --> 04:39:04,450
Anonilus for the one dollar. Hey, I meant to say thanks

4125
04:39:04,450 --> 04:39:06,450
in the last... I meant to say this in the last donation.

4126
04:39:06,450 --> 04:39:08,450
Uh, come up with a dumb

4127
04:39:08,450 --> 04:39:10,450
name for my

4128
04:39:10,450 --> 04:39:12,450
black duckling.

4129
04:39:12,450 --> 04:39:14,619
Italics named one

4130
04:39:14,619 --> 04:39:16,619
Bloor Boolean, so make it something dumb.

4131
04:39:16,619 --> 04:39:19,569
Enjoy these bits.

4132
04:39:19,569 --> 04:39:26,659
Um, how about, uh...

4133
04:39:26,659 --> 04:39:28,659
How about something like...

4134
04:39:28,659 --> 04:39:33,380
Uh...

4135
04:39:33,380 --> 04:39:38,750
Like a duck.

4136
04:39:38,750 --> 04:39:54,139
Uh, um... Bilbo.

4137
04:39:54,139 --> 04:39:57,409
With two L's.

4138
04:39:57,409 --> 04:39:59,409
I'm sorry, but that's what you're gonna get tonight.

4139
04:39:59,409 --> 04:40:05,020
No, don't boo me.

4140
04:40:05,020 --> 04:40:07,020
No, don't boo me.

4141
04:40:07,020 --> 04:40:09,259
But thank you for the one dollar, and

4142
04:40:09,259 --> 04:40:11,259
I look forward to the duck streams.

4143
04:40:11,259 --> 04:40:13,259
Thank you Tingy for the one dollar. Spent all the bits I had on one joke.

4144
04:40:13,259 --> 04:40:15,259
This is the last of them.

4145
04:40:15,259 --> 04:40:17,259
I'll need to buy more before tomorrow's stream. Don't worry about that.

4146
04:40:17,259 --> 04:40:23,020
But thank you

4147
04:40:23,020 --> 04:40:25,020
for the one dollar, Tingy.

4148
04:40:25,020 --> 04:40:27,020
And finally, quarter dime for the one dollar. Hey, Jerma, I know this might sound

4149
04:40:27,020 --> 04:40:29,020
weird, but I actually enjoy the

4150
04:40:29,020 --> 04:40:31,020
spam memes.

4151
04:40:31,020 --> 04:40:33,259
Can we just get a good five minutes

4152
04:40:33,259 --> 04:40:35,259
out of them before they get shut down?

4153
04:40:35,259 --> 04:40:38,139
What do you mean shut down?

4154
04:40:38,139 --> 04:40:40,770
Shut down?

4155
04:40:40,770 --> 04:40:43,970
No, there's no spam.

4156
04:40:43,970 --> 04:40:45,970
I'm not gonna encourage spam on this channel.

4157
04:40:45,970 --> 04:40:47,970
This is a PogChamp moment when I'm gonna say that on stream.

4158
04:40:47,970 --> 04:40:51,229
But here are the subs

4159
04:40:51,229 --> 04:40:53,229
and the resubs for tonight.

4160
04:40:53,229 --> 04:40:56,180
A ton of community subs, a ton of money.

4161
04:40:56,180 --> 04:40:58,419
I, again, just want to apologize

4162
04:40:58,419 --> 04:41:00,419
for another, like, five hour stream

4163
04:41:00,419 --> 04:41:02,419
or four hour

4164
04:41:02,419 --> 04:41:04,419
and then, you know, this part.

4165
04:41:04,419 --> 04:41:06,419
We'll come back. We'll try it again tomorrow.

4166
04:41:06,419 --> 04:41:08,419
Strong. If you're just joining us

4167
04:41:08,419 --> 04:41:10,419
I just got another one of those fucking

4168
04:41:10,419 --> 04:41:12,419
weird, like, tired headache

4169
04:41:12,419 --> 04:41:14,419
things. Last time

4170
04:41:14,419 --> 04:41:16,419
it just, I got, like, just sleepy.

4171
04:41:16,419 --> 04:41:18,849
But I'm actually feeling some,

4172
04:41:18,849 --> 04:41:20,849
like, pain and pressure here. So.

4173
04:41:20,849 --> 04:41:23,599
Annoying, but I have to deal with it.

4174
04:41:23,599 --> 04:41:25,599
I'm sorry. It's just the way it is.

4175
04:41:25,599 --> 04:41:29,169
See you guys tomorrow. Same

4176
04:41:29,169 --> 04:41:31,169
time. Much love to you.

4177
04:41:31,169 --> 04:41:34,180
Thank you.

4178
04:41:34,180 --> 04:41:36,740
Thank you. Double D just came in with another one dollar.

4179
04:41:36,740 --> 04:41:38,740
Goodnight gamers and goodnight Jerma.

4180
04:41:38,740 --> 04:41:40,740
Smiley face. And then they actually put a smiley face.

4181
04:41:40,740 --> 04:41:47,779
See you tomorrow.

4182
04:41:47,779 --> 04:41:56,799
Smiley face.

4183
04:41:56,799 --> 04:42:00,770
Yeah, there was, there was a

4184
04:42:00,770 --> 04:42:02,770
let me see how many community subs came in from earlier.

4185
04:42:02,770 --> 04:42:04,770
Somebody, there was, like, what, like 50

4186
04:42:04,770 --> 04:42:06,770
or something. For tonight.

4187
04:42:06,770 --> 04:42:10,220
Yeah.

4188
04:42:10,220 --> 04:42:13,490
The Olaf just

4189
04:42:13,490 --> 04:42:15,490
dropped an absolute missile.

4190
04:42:15,490 --> 04:42:17,490
So did Furt.

4191
04:42:17,490 --> 04:42:20,430
Great Canadian.

4192
04:42:20,430 --> 04:42:23,810
You guys are

4193
04:42:23,810 --> 04:42:25,810
significant. You have a significant

4194
04:42:25,810 --> 04:42:27,810
amount of subs come from a lot of

4195
04:42:27,810 --> 04:42:30,500
a lot of people that are here now. So thank you

4196
04:42:30,500 --> 04:42:33,180
guys. Dorkcube, thanks for the

4197
04:42:33,180 --> 04:42:35,180
one dollar DVD commentary for streams

4198
04:42:35,180 --> 04:42:38,450
joke. When?

4199
04:42:38,450 --> 04:42:40,450
You mean, like, re-stream a stream and then do

4200
04:42:40,450 --> 04:42:42,450
DVD commentary?

4201
04:42:42,450 --> 04:42:47,180
How many emotes slots do we have now?

4202
04:42:47,180 --> 04:42:49,180
It's probably so many.

4203
04:42:49,180 --> 04:42:53,139
Let me see.

4204
04:42:53,139 --> 04:42:55,139
At least another 10.

4205
04:42:55,139 --> 04:42:57,139
I already had, like, I had still had like five

4206
04:42:57,139 --> 04:42:59,139
or six that were still open.

4207
04:42:59,139 --> 04:43:01,139
Gonna have to come up with some more emotes.

4208
04:43:01,139 --> 04:43:09,389
See a doctor for the headaches?

4209
04:43:09,389 --> 04:43:13,740
I have, don't worry, I have seen a doctor.

4210
04:43:13,740 --> 04:43:16,180
I have. I actually was

4211
04:43:16,180 --> 04:43:18,180
I've been getting all kinds of checkups

4212
04:43:18,180 --> 04:43:20,180
and tests over the last three or four weeks.

4213
04:43:20,180 --> 04:43:23,250
So I'm in the process,

4214
04:43:23,250 --> 04:43:30,799
don't worry. Let's see the Bitcoin

4215
04:43:30,799 --> 04:43:32,799
doctor.

4216
04:43:32,799 --> 04:43:39,520
I don't think that's real.

4217
04:43:39,520 --> 04:43:42,909
If it is, that's pretty ridiculous.

4218
04:43:42,909 --> 04:43:48,659
But, take care

4219
04:43:48,659 --> 04:43:50,659
guys. I'm gonna go relax.

4220
04:43:50,659 --> 04:43:52,659
And we'll go again tomorrow.

4221
04:43:52,659 --> 04:43:54,659
Hopefully I can finish Resident

4222
04:43:54,659 --> 04:43:56,900
Evil 2 tomorrow. See you guys

4223
04:43:56,900 --> 04:43:58,900
very soon. Take care.

4224
04:43:58,900 --> 04:44:00,900
Much love. See you soon. Have a great night.

4225
04:44:00,900 --> 04:44:03,459
Goodbye.
