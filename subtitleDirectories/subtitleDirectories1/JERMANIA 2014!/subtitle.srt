1
00:00:02,359 --> 00:00:07,879
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the chairman and the sole proprietor of the

2
00:00:07,879 --> 00:00:14,140
German Wrestling Federation, German 985. Here to do the opening ceremonies for

3
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:25,420
our first ever Germania. Just want to say welcome everybody to Germania 2014.

4
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:33,079
That's right, that's right. Let me hear you scream. Pump it up baby. So we got a

5
00:00:33,079 --> 00:00:36,679
lot of cool shit planned for you guys tonight. We got a lot of awesome matches

6
00:00:36,679 --> 00:00:42,280
and I just want to be real clear with you all about something tonight. If any of

7
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:45,640
you think I'm gonna lose the championship match against Captain Crunch,

8
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:49,399
then you got something coming. If you think I'm that bad to lose against a

9
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:55,039
serial character... And here we go. Ladies and gentlemen, if you don't know that

10
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:59,840
music, you should because it's none other than Glooman. After what happened last

11
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:07,989
time at Germa Rumble 2, I'm sure he has something to say to Germa. What the fuck are

12
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:14,870
you doing here, Glooman? This is my night. Jeez. Yes, it is just always about you, isn't it, Germa?

13
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:19,430
Well, I've got a surprise for you. Surprise? I mean, I wasn't aware of a

14
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:25,150
surprise. It's me you'll be facing in the championship match. What? What? That's

15
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:29,430
impossible. Where's Captain Crunch? Captain Crunch and Germa both won the

16
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:32,549
Germa Rumbles. They're the ones that are eligible for the championship. This is a

17
00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:46,329
revelation indeed. What is going to happen next? Welcome back, ladies and

18
00:01:46,329 --> 00:01:51,489
gentlemen, to Germania 2014. We're gonna get the first match underway, and it's

19
00:01:51,489 --> 00:01:55,370
going to be starring none other than Gabe Newell, who you all know and love.

20
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:58,769
Gabe Newell is gonna be facing a couple of different opponents here. He's going...

21
00:01:58,769 --> 00:02:03,129
Gabe Newell gets attacked from behind by Sonic the Hedgehog with a chair! Sonic

22
00:02:03,129 --> 00:02:06,730
the Hedgehog and Pac-Man behind him! These are his two opponents, by the way.

23
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:10,569
No introductions have gone down. It's just Gabe Newell coming down by himself,

24
00:02:10,569 --> 00:02:15,689
and he gets absolutely ambushed by these two disgraceful wrestlers, can I just

25
00:02:15,689 --> 00:02:18,729
say right now, when Gabe Newell gonna take a chair shot right in his face, and

26
00:02:18,729 --> 00:02:22,969
the match hasn't even started. This is just even more ridiculous when you

27
00:02:22,969 --> 00:02:28,490
consider the match you're about to see is a 2v1 handicap tornado tag match.

28
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:32,810
Gabe Newell versus Sonic and Pac-Man in the ring at the same time, and you're

29
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:36,129
gonna see Gabe Newell flustered right now. He's trying to keep his composure, but

30
00:02:36,129 --> 00:02:39,330
how can you, after something so disgraceful like that, and there's the

31
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:43,969
bell, ladies and gentlemen, first match of Germania 2014! What a way to start it,

32
00:02:43,969 --> 00:02:48,849
and right off the bat, Gabe Newell takes a double DDT on top of all the

33
00:02:48,849 --> 00:02:52,169
punishment he has seen so far, and I'm not exactly sure why there's a referee

34
00:02:52,169 --> 00:02:57,050
in the ring. Can we very, very clearly state this? The referee serves no

35
00:02:57,050 --> 00:03:01,770
purpose because there are no rules in the German arena. There is no set rules.

36
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:05,969
Anything can happen as to why what we just saw was totally legal, and what a

37
00:03:05,969 --> 00:03:10,289
spinning, almost a neck break type move on the top rope, pulling him down, and

38
00:03:10,289 --> 00:03:14,169
Gabe Newell spins and slams his face on Sonic's face into the ground while

39
00:03:14,169 --> 00:03:19,379
Pac-Man sort of just sits there watching, and you might be wondering why this? Why

40
00:03:19,379 --> 00:03:24,139
does Gabe Newell have to go against these two fighters at the same time? Well, it

41
00:03:24,139 --> 00:03:28,259
was a challenge that Sonic gave to Gabe Newell after he was humiliated in the

42
00:03:28,259 --> 00:03:31,460
first German rumble with the powerbomb over the top turnbuckle that Gabe Newell

43
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:35,969
did to him, and his choice was Pac-Man. I'm not exactly sure why you'd pick

44
00:03:36,129 --> 00:03:39,810
Pac-Man is going after the referee. Pac-Man just tried to punch the referee in

45
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:44,210
the face. I think he might be a little confused as to who the opponents are, but

46
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:48,300
that's Pac-Man. He kind of just does his own thing, and you can't really corral

47
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:51,020
them, but I'm assuming it's because they have a lot of history. They're both very

48
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:56,620
old characters, probably friends from 20, 30 years ago, and what a DDT. Double DDT

49
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:59,740
by Gabe Newell, and the crowd is getting really riled up right now. What's

50
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:03,159
happening? Someone's coming down to the arena. That's Gordon Freeman. Gordon

51
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:06,400
Freeman was watching backstage. No doubt got sick and tired of watching this

52
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,479
2v1. Sonic and Pac-Man beating up on his boss. He's going to come at him even the

53
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:15,360
odds for sure here, and he slides in the ring looking for some blood, and it looks

54
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:20,000
like no, no, no! He punches Gabe Newell in the face. He punched Gabe Newell right in

55
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,240
the face, and here comes the Spy sprinting down to the arena. He's not going to waste

56
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,639
any time. He sees his boss in dire need. It's his favorite class, the Spy. Gordon

57
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:33,120
Freeman gets out and goes right for him, and it seems like the Spy just picked up

58
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:37,759
a sledgehammer from underneath the ring. The Spy took a sledgehammer from underneath

59
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:41,920
and is smashing Gordon Freeman with it. This is getting insane. I can't believe

60
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:45,920
what I'm seeing right here, and all the while, Gabe Newell with a fantastic

61
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:51,439
double DDT. Wow. Okay, maybe take a little bit of a breather after that one. No time

62
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:55,040
for a breather. There's no time for a breather. Look at this crossface. Sonic

63
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,319
is in a crossface right now while Pac-Man is face down on the mat. Gabe Newell

64
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:02,000
could get a submission here. He's taking any second here. Oh, Pac-Man with a nice

65
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,079
breakup elbow drop on Gabe Newell, who could have easily just walked away right

66
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:12,319
there with a victory. Had he not broken it up, but this has become an intense,

67
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:16,800
insanely intense first match here in Germania 2004. What the fuck is Pac-Man

68
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,500
doing? Okay, he just like flipped himself over the ropes. That was a little odd.

69
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:23,939
He got a chair. That's what he was doing. He knew exactly what he was doing. Picking

70
00:05:23,939 --> 00:05:28,339
up a chair from under the ring. There are no rules. Remember, guys, nobody can be

71
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:33,279
disqualified for any of this behavior that you're seeing right here, and Gabe

72
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:37,899
Newell's being held back by Sonic, and Pac-Man's not doing anything. Pac-Man is

73
00:05:37,899 --> 00:05:41,379
staring at him with the chair. Okay, I think Gabe Newell is kind of confused as

74
00:05:41,379 --> 00:05:44,819
well, and he gets a Bulldog for his trouble. Pac-Man, I think, blew a casket

75
00:05:44,819 --> 00:05:49,250
in his brain and is just standing there with the chair in his hand. I think when

76
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:54,779
he went from point A to point B, picking chair up and putting chair in hand may

77
00:05:54,779 --> 00:05:57,500
have just ruined his whole brain. I'm not sure, but we're going to talk about

78
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:00,860
what's actually happening. Gabe Newell and Sonic the Hedgehog seem to be in a

79
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:05,420
1v1 situation at this point, and you got the Spy and Gordon Freeman on your left,

80
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:08,459
so remember they're still there, and you got to figure that Gabe is going to try

81
00:06:08,459 --> 00:06:12,139
to take the fullest advantage of this situation. Looks like he has a chance

82
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:15,660
right here. Going to set Sonic up in a powerbomb, just like the first Jerma

83
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:19,740
Rumble. Can he capitalize? He brings him straight down with a Razor's Edge. This

84
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:23,899
could be it. Pac-Man is still catatonic. Can he get the one count? He gets one. He

85
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:27,899
gets two. Can he get the third one? He got the third one, and Pac-Man just

86
00:06:27,899 --> 00:06:32,060
drunkenly falls over with the chair. What was he doing that whole time?

87
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:35,660
Nobody will ever know the answer to that question, but Gabe Newell

88
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:41,899
goes against all odds at a 3v1 at one point before the Spy came in and sealed

89
00:06:41,899 --> 00:06:46,939
himself the victory. So, Gabe Newell, congratulations on the first match win,

90
00:06:47,889 --> 00:06:51,250
and apparently we're going to go backstage right now. A fight has broken

91
00:06:51,329 --> 00:06:54,930
out in the garage area. I'm not entirely sure what's happening, though those are

92
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:59,410
Biaz. Those are the four Biaz that are supposed to be in the cage match for the

93
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:03,259
third match of Germania. Hopefully they don't waste all their energy by

94
00:07:03,259 --> 00:07:06,939
preemptively getting started, and if you want my personal opinion on this,

95
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:11,259
you can't put a bunch of Biaz in the same dressing room and only have one

96
00:07:11,259 --> 00:07:15,629
McDonald's Happy Meal in there. That's how this shit gets started. But whatever,

97
00:07:15,629 --> 00:07:18,990
we've got a match to get to. Second match of Germania coming up right now.

98
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:22,750
Here it is. The introductions have already been started. This match is going

99
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:27,699
to be a very, very interesting one. We've got a gauntlet match lined up here.

100
00:07:27,699 --> 00:07:31,060
If you don't know what a gauntlet match is, it's when one person has to

101
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:35,300
consecutively go against multiple other opponents, and in this case it's going

102
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:40,420
to be Grandpa versus all the shitty characters. And this is a request from

103
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:44,420
Grandpa. He said, fuck the shitty characters. I'm sick of seeing them. I

104
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:48,579
want to put a stop to it once and for all. So he's going to get that opportunity

105
00:07:48,579 --> 00:07:53,699
starting with the 30s Milkman, who is, in my opinion, the worst character

106
00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:56,420
that's ever been made. I've said this before. I've brought up a lot of the

107
00:07:56,420 --> 00:08:00,259
different shitty characters that have been made. I think Milkman is the worst

108
00:08:00,259 --> 00:08:03,220
one because, I mean, he's just like a guy with, like, white pants and white

109
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:07,779
shirt and hat on. Like, the guy sucks. But that's the bell, so that means we're

110
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:12,100
going to get started here. If Grandpa pins the Milkman, that means that

111
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:15,379
somebody else, one of the other shitty characters, is going to come down. It's

112
00:08:15,379 --> 00:08:18,180
going to be one after the other, after the other, after the other, and the only

113
00:08:18,259 --> 00:08:23,060
way this can be stopped is if Grandpa goes through all of them or if somebody

114
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:28,269
ends up pinning Grandpa. So it's going to get pretty interesting. Hopefully, I

115
00:08:28,269 --> 00:08:32,830
mean, the Milkman could just win right now, and that would be a pretty awful

116
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:37,309
match. So I'm assuming Grandpa has it in him to at least get through one person

117
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:41,789
or two people. I mean, as kind of sloppy and shitty that Grandpa is, Grandpa

118
00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:46,110
himself is kind of a shitty character. But, you know, we won't say that too

119
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:50,669
loudly so he doesn't hear us while he sets up a neck breaker, and Milkman's

120
00:08:50,669 --> 00:08:53,629
legs almost got caught on the ropes there. While Grandpa is going to go for a

121
00:08:53,629 --> 00:08:58,429
pin one, he gets the one count. And typically, when you see a one count, it

122
00:08:58,429 --> 00:09:04,110
means that the other person is almost totally fine. There is really no damage

123
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:10,019
being done by Grandpa. Or, what the hell was that? That was like a toddler picking

124
00:09:10,019 --> 00:09:13,539
up an adult and putting him on his face. Like, that was, oh, what a reversal by

125
00:09:13,539 --> 00:09:18,500
Grandpa. He's favoring the drop kicks for some reason. Grandpa really

126
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,820
likes those drop kicks, and he's going to go for a knee smash here into the

127
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:24,100
ground. No, that probably hurts. That probably does hurt. Going to go for

128
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:29,299
another pin, gets the one, one count again. So very clearly, this is quite a

129
00:09:29,299 --> 00:09:32,820
stalemate between two weak-ass people. And Grandpa, I don't know what he's

130
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:36,980
expecting here. If he can't even go through the 30s Milkman while he gets

131
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:41,779
spun around and slammed on his back, if Grandpa cannot even go through the 30s

132
00:09:41,779 --> 00:09:45,779
Milkman, how does he expect to go through six more people after this? I'm

133
00:09:45,779 --> 00:09:50,980
looking at my notes here. I'm pretty sure it is six people. So, good luck to

134
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:55,539
you, Grandpa. While he lines up some type of maneuver here, really got to get his

135
00:09:55,539 --> 00:09:59,139
footing there, knee smash right in the face, jumping almost on the throat there

136
00:09:59,139 --> 00:10:03,940
on Milkman. Going to go for a pin, one, two, finally gets the two count on the

137
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:09,460
Milkman. So, progress is being made. As awful progress as it is, while he throws

138
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:13,460
him into the ropes there, it's still progress. And, as much as Grandpa...

139
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:15,460
You want to check the fuck up over here? You want to check the fuck up?

140
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:17,460
What the fuck are you doing? I can hear every single word you're saying.

141
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:19,460
Dude, just don't destroy the desk. Oh, no.

142
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:22,019
What the fuck are you looking at, asshole?

143
00:10:22,019 --> 00:10:25,659
Fuck you, old man. Fuck you.

144
00:10:25,659 --> 00:10:27,659
I just want to come see a wrestling show. I'm out of here.

145
00:10:27,659 --> 00:10:31,659
See, that's what happens. You can't do that, Grandpa. He gets picked up by

146
00:10:31,659 --> 00:10:35,659
Milkman. Milkman had kind of floated his way out here, somehow. But now

147
00:10:35,659 --> 00:10:37,659
they're over here. No, Grandpa, no, no, no.

148
00:10:37,659 --> 00:10:39,659
You think I'm a shitty character? No, this is not the time to be doing this.

149
00:10:39,659 --> 00:10:41,659
You think I'm a shitty character?

150
00:10:41,659 --> 00:10:43,659
This is our commentary table.

151
00:10:43,659 --> 00:10:45,659
Oh, okay. All right, all right.

152
00:10:45,659 --> 00:10:47,659
Yay! Go away. Thank you very much.

153
00:10:47,659 --> 00:10:52,340
Milkman. Milkman, are you all right? He's not responding.

154
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:56,340
The referee has rung the bell, which means the next combatant has to go in.

155
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:58,340
He can't perform anymore. So, it's going to be the chicken.

156
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:00,340
And someone's coming from the Raptors.

157
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:02,340
Somebody just splashed off of the Titan-tron.

158
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:06,340
That's the turkey. That's the turkey. That's the chicken's long-lost rival.

159
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:10,340
I am shocked that he is able to get up and walk around after a 50-plus foot

160
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:14,340
jump right there. And there's Martin Van Buren from behind.

161
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,340
They're not even coming out in the right order.

162
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:18,340
This is supposed to be a gauntlet match.

163
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:20,340
They're not even coming out in the right order.

164
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:22,340
It's supposed to be one after the other. What are they doing?

165
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:24,340
What triggered this? I seriously don't...

166
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:26,340
And Santa Claus is under the ring?

167
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:30,340
Santa Claus has been under that ring for probably like three hours, by the way.

168
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:34,340
Meanwhile, Grandpa, not paying any attention to who's behind him.

169
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:36,340
That's Batboy with a clothesline.

170
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:38,340
He's supposed to be dead.

171
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:40,340
Batboy is supposed to be dead right now.

172
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:42,340
But for some reason, he just snuck up behind him.

173
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:44,340
Is he even supposed to be in this?

174
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:48,700
He's not. Everybody that is supposed to be a combatant in this gauntlet

175
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,700
is over on the left side fighting right now.

176
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,700
And Batboy is in the ring.

177
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:54,700
Does this even qualify as a match anymore?

178
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:56,700
I'm not sure, but what a spinning kick.

179
00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:00,879
Just laying Grandpa out, who must be pretty annoyed right now.

180
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:04,879
He went through Milkman and then was supposed to go after the chicken.

181
00:12:04,879 --> 00:12:06,879
The turkey showed up. Van Buren showed up.

182
00:12:06,879 --> 00:12:09,879
All these people showed up when they weren't really supposed to.

183
00:12:09,879 --> 00:12:11,879
And there's just chaos going on on the left side.

184
00:12:11,879 --> 00:12:13,879
I'm not sure if we can cut to that for a second.

185
00:12:13,879 --> 00:12:15,879
I want you to see what's going on.

186
00:12:15,879 --> 00:12:19,879
Milkman has gotten up and he is just taunting Santa Claus.

187
00:12:19,879 --> 00:12:22,879
I'm not sure why, but Santa Claus and the Milkman are both going to go out of here.

188
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:24,879
No, we've got the turkey. Van Buren trying to keep the peace.

189
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:26,879
Santa Claus is going to go for a punch.

190
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:28,879
Santa Claus punches him in the face and the Milkman is not happy.

191
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:30,879
He's not happy jumping across and hitting him.

192
00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:32,879
I think I saw the egg there as well.

193
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:34,879
So I don't know what's happening.

194
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:38,879
I think when you bring the term shitty character in, and this is my personal opinion,

195
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:40,879
I think this is what happened.

196
00:12:40,879 --> 00:12:42,879
Everybody here, it was called a shitty character.

197
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:46,879
And I think that they are all pissed about that and trying to prove to each other

198
00:12:46,879 --> 00:12:48,879
that they are not the shitty character.

199
00:12:48,879 --> 00:12:50,879
But we got Grandpa with a one, a two.

200
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:52,879
Could it be? Oh, he didn't get the three count.

201
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:54,879
He just barely did not get the three count.

202
00:12:54,879 --> 00:12:56,879
That was centimeters away from the three count.

203
00:12:56,879 --> 00:12:58,879
And now we've got a good old fashioned slobber-docker in the middle of the ring.

204
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:00,879
Grandpa doing some right hands.

205
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:02,879
And here comes Van Buren to break it up.

206
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:06,879
I'm assuming he's on the side of Batboy, but you really never know what's going on.

207
00:13:06,879 --> 00:13:08,879
Now he's getting stomped.

208
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:10,879
And here comes everybody else.

209
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:12,879
This ring is going to get flooded with people right now.

210
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:14,879
Could be a huge standoff between all these characters.

211
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:16,879
Grandpa in the corner just barely getting himself up.

212
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:18,879
And oh no.

213
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:21,549
Grandpa, you are in a world of shit right now.

214
00:13:21,549 --> 00:13:23,549
But he still has at least a little bit of life left in him.

215
00:13:23,549 --> 00:13:25,549
Can he take on all of these shitty characters?

216
00:13:25,549 --> 00:13:27,549
Doesn't look like it. He's getting overwhelmed at this point.

217
00:13:27,549 --> 00:13:29,549
Ring the bell. Ring the bell. This is over.

218
00:13:29,549 --> 00:13:31,549
I've seen enough. I don't want to see any more of this.

219
00:13:31,549 --> 00:13:33,549
Please just get this ring clear.

220
00:13:33,549 --> 00:13:35,549
Everybody's disqualified.

221
00:13:35,549 --> 00:13:37,549
We're going to move on to the next match.

222
00:13:37,549 --> 00:13:39,549
We'll see you all in a few moments.

223
00:13:39,549 --> 00:13:41,549
Poor Grandpa.

224
00:13:41,549 --> 00:13:46,460
But you agree with me though, right?

225
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:48,460
No, I do agree with you.

226
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,460
I think if we can't get a hold of Captain Crunch,

227
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:52,460
no one's heard of him in like six weeks.

228
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:54,460
And the egg went to dinner with his wife.

229
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:56,460
And it's going to have to be you in the latter match.

230
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:58,460
And it's going to have to be you in the latter match. It is.

231
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:00,460
You're just telling me when to go. I'm ready.

232
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:02,460
I'll be here. I'll be in the backstage. I'll be ready whenever you need me.

233
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:08,100
You little bunch of bullshit.

234
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:10,340
This is still going on.

235
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:12,340
This is still going on backstage.

236
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:14,340
They're still beating the shit out of each other.

237
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:16,639
He's going to split his head in a car.

238
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:19,070
He just slammed his head in a car door.

239
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:21,070
Why is he pinning him?

240
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:23,070
There's no pins right now.

241
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:25,070
I think they are just all so fucking drunk

242
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:27,070
that they have no idea that they're not even in a match right now.

243
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:29,070
They might think they've been in the match the entire time.

244
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:31,070
But they're supposed to be in a cage match right now.

245
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:33,070
And they're not...

246
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:36,320
Okay, we're going to let them just fight.

247
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,879
This is the third match.

248
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:40,879
Okay, they're obviously not listening.

249
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:42,879
So we're going to just get right into this here.

250
00:14:42,879 --> 00:14:44,879
This is a four-way backstage battle.

251
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:46,879
And the last man standing wins.

252
00:14:46,879 --> 00:14:48,879
That's what I've been told by my producers.

253
00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:50,879
And that's what we're going to do.

254
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:52,879
So it seems like Lumberjack Beer and King Beer

255
00:14:52,879 --> 00:14:54,879
are fighting each other.

256
00:14:54,879 --> 00:14:56,879
I don't know why he's calling himself King Beer.

257
00:14:56,879 --> 00:14:58,879
They don't like being associated with numbers anymore, apparently.

258
00:14:58,879 --> 00:15:00,879
But that's something I was told before the show started.

259
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:02,879
That it's no longer Beer No. 25.

260
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:04,879
Beer No. 300.

261
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:06,879
King Beer, by the way, looked like he was down for the count there.

262
00:15:06,879 --> 00:15:08,879
But he gets back up.

263
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:10,879
And it seems like Sexy Beer

264
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:12,879
and Big Boy Beer.

265
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:14,879
That's the other two, by the way, if you're wondering.

266
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:16,879
If you're keeping track.

267
00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:18,879
But who really is? They're all beers.

268
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:21,379
It doesn't really matter.

269
00:15:21,379 --> 00:15:23,379
But yeah, last man standing, we've got a suplex, a tiger suplex

270
00:15:23,379 --> 00:15:25,379
onto the concrete.

271
00:15:25,379 --> 00:15:27,379
Remember, this is concrete.

272
00:15:27,379 --> 00:15:29,379
There is no soft area for you to land on.

273
00:15:29,379 --> 00:15:31,379
They're just throwing each other into stuff.

274
00:15:31,379 --> 00:15:33,379
Just like that, right into the wall

275
00:15:33,379 --> 00:15:35,379
goes Sexy Beer, by Lumberjack Beer.

276
00:15:35,379 --> 00:15:37,379
And if I were to guess,

277
00:15:37,379 --> 00:15:39,379
if I were to take a wild guess,

278
00:15:39,379 --> 00:15:41,379
I'm going to say King Beer is going to win this.

279
00:15:41,379 --> 00:15:43,379
Because he's the King Beer.

280
00:15:43,379 --> 00:15:45,679
No, King Beer is down.

281
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:47,679
King Beer is down for the count. He's not getting up.

282
00:15:47,679 --> 00:15:50,240
So is Sexy Beer. We're down to two already.

283
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,240
I guess I'll give them a little bit of credit where it's due.

284
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,240
They have been going at it for

285
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,240
the entire evening so far.

286
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,240
This is not totally unexpected

287
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,240
that two of them would go down.

288
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,240
I'm surprised any of them are standing at this point.

289
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,240
What a slam! He slammed his head

290
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,240
on the side of that wall.

291
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,240
That is a solid wall.

292
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,240
How are these two still alive?

293
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,240
A better question is, are the two on the ground

294
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,240
even still alive?

295
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,240
I'm not even entirely certain.

296
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,240
What I am certain of is

297
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,240
these guys are going to owe us a lot of money.

298
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,240
Because they told us they were going to do a cage match.

299
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,240
We bought the cage. It cost like

300
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,240
seven and a half thousand dollars to get that cage here.

301
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,240
And they're not even using it.

302
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,240
So somebody owes us a lot of money.

303
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,240
And I don't know who's...they have like a beer fund.

304
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,419
But they better pay up.

305
00:16:34,419 --> 00:16:36,419
Groin kick by Big Boy Beer

306
00:16:36,419 --> 00:16:38,419
to Lumberjack Beer. But he receives a couple of punches

307
00:16:38,419 --> 00:16:40,419
for his trouble. And he gets...

308
00:16:40,419 --> 00:16:42,419
Lumberjack Beer gets an elbow in the face which kind of

309
00:16:42,419 --> 00:16:44,419
distracted him for a second. And there he goes!

310
00:16:44,419 --> 00:16:46,419
Down his head! Hit the ground! That's it!

311
00:16:46,419 --> 00:16:48,419
The Beer Battle Royale is going to

312
00:16:48,419 --> 00:16:50,419
go to Beer 419

313
00:16:50,419 --> 00:16:52,419
or Big Boy Beer

314
00:16:52,419 --> 00:16:54,419
as he likes to be called.

315
00:16:54,419 --> 00:16:56,419
Doing a lot of trash talking and

316
00:16:56,419 --> 00:16:58,419
making his way out of the arena. And look out!

317
00:16:58,419 --> 00:17:00,659
Watch out!

318
00:17:00,659 --> 00:17:04,299
Who was that?

319
00:17:04,299 --> 00:17:18,059
Who would do that?

320
00:17:18,059 --> 00:17:20,059
I'm the only beer that matters.

321
00:17:20,059 --> 00:17:22,819
Fuck all those pieces of...

322
00:17:22,819 --> 00:17:25,440
We're back ladies and gentlemen with the

323
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,440
final match of the evening.

324
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,440
This is the main event

325
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,440
of Germania 2014

326
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,440
as we learned not that long ago.

327
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,440
This is going to be a ladder

328
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,440
match between Glooman

329
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,440
and Germa for the World

330
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,440
Championship of Germa

331
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,440
Wrestling Federation. It should be a good

332
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,440
one. My blood is boiling.

333
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,440
Let's get to the contestants.

334
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,440
Coming down to the arena first is going to be

335
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,440
Germa who does not really need

336
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,440
an introduction. I don't need to tell you who this guy is.

337
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,440
A lot of you already know and if you're just finding

338
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,440
this video somehow and you don't know who I am

339
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,440
or who this guy is, well then

340
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,440
hi. Welcome to Germa985.

341
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,680
I hope you enjoy your stay. Anywho, we're going to get to the next

342
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,680
contestant. The next contestant is Glooman

343
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,680
who is kind of

344
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,980
on a mission here. Glooman is

345
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:11,980
well aware that he was created as

346
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:13,980
a shitty character. Glooman is well

347
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:15,980
aware that he's just been ridiculed

348
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:17,980
and everyone thinks he's a joke. And he

349
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:19,980
is out for blood tonight. He's out to prove

350
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:21,980
everybody wrong. That not

351
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:23,980
only can you rise up from the bottom

352
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:25,980
but you can stay at the top as well.

353
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:28,289
And here's to hoping we get to see a very

354
00:18:28,289 --> 00:18:30,289
good match between these two very skilled

355
00:18:30,289 --> 00:18:32,289
two very skilled opponents to

356
00:18:32,289 --> 00:18:34,289
each other. And we're going to get the ladders involved as well.

357
00:18:34,289 --> 00:18:36,289
So ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the

358
00:18:36,289 --> 00:18:38,849
main event. There is

359
00:18:38,849 --> 00:18:40,849
the bell everybody. Hope you have

360
00:18:40,849 --> 00:18:42,849
your popcorn ready because this one is going

361
00:18:42,849 --> 00:18:44,849
to be a doozy indeed.

362
00:18:44,849 --> 00:18:46,849
A lot of history here.

363
00:18:46,849 --> 00:18:48,849
A lot of aggression. And a lot

364
00:18:48,849 --> 00:18:50,849
of things that need to be dealt with. A lot of

365
00:18:50,849 --> 00:18:52,849
problems that have to be sorted out between

366
00:18:52,849 --> 00:18:54,849
these two. And this is a perfect place to do it at the

367
00:18:54,849 --> 00:18:57,150
main event of Germania. The coveted

368
00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:59,150
world championship of Germa

369
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:01,150
Wrestling Federation is on the line

370
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:03,150
here. This is it. This is

371
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:05,150
the one. There is no other title. There are

372
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:07,150
no other titles besides the

373
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:09,150
world championship. Unlike other wrestling

374
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:11,150
venues, there is only one.

375
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,150
And it is this one. What a belly

376
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:15,150
to back suplex. He back flips him.

377
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:17,150
That'll take the wind out of your sails real

378
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:19,150
quickly. He follows it up with a couple of punches

379
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:21,150
to Glue Man's face. And I

380
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:23,150
would like to address this really

381
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:25,390
really shortly. If Glue Man is made

382
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:27,390
out of glue, right? Because that's like what he's

383
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:29,390
supposed to be. He's supposed to be a man made out of glue.

384
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:31,630
How do you feel pain?

385
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:33,630
Does he feel pain? Does he break

386
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:35,630
bones? Does he have any bones?

387
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:37,630
That is a question for a scientist.

388
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:39,630
And not a question for

389
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:41,630
me. But we're going to get back to the action

390
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:43,630
here. I wanted to talk about the ladders.

391
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:45,630
Because if you're unaware, if you don't know

392
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:47,630
how a ladder match works in a

393
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:49,630
wrestling federation, essentially

394
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:51,630
it's somebody has to pull that ladder into

395
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:53,630
the ring. And the championship

396
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:55,630
briefcase is floating above

397
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:57,630
on the catwalk. So what you have to do is

398
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:59,630
you have to put the ladder down. Beautiful DDT

399
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:01,630
by the way. You have to put a ladder

400
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:03,630
down, climb up, and

401
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:05,630
grab the briefcase and rip it down.

402
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:07,630
That's the only way to win this match.

403
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:09,630
You cannot pin. There is

404
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:11,630
no giving up. It's only

405
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:13,630
climbing up that ladder. And

406
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:15,630
there are a couple of them surrounding the

407
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:17,630
ring. So their options here

408
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:19,630
are pretty varied.

409
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:21,630
They can go from either side of the ring, which looks like

410
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:23,630
Jerma might be doing it. Might be picking up the ladder for the first

411
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:25,630
time. He's got a ladder throwing it into the ring.

412
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:27,630
This is where it gets interesting.

413
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:29,630
No, they're going to stay outside.

414
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:31,630
Usually once the ladder gets put into play,

415
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:33,630
that's when you see. Oh, what a cheap

416
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:35,630
shot. What a cheap shot by

417
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:37,630
Jerma. That was disgraceful. That was

418
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:39,630
unbelievable. You don't pull that in a championship

419
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:41,630
match. Well, I guess

420
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:43,630
you do if you want to win, which Jerma

421
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:45,630
will do anything to win apparently.

422
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:47,630
Belly to belly suplex.

423
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:49,630
Glueman almost into the stairs there.

424
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:51,630
And now the Glueman is incapacitated.

425
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:53,630
It seems like Jerma is going to set the ladder up here for the

426
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:55,630
first time. Maybe he's going to hit him with the ladder.

427
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:57,630
He doesn't hit him. He gets reversed.

428
00:20:57,630 --> 00:20:59,630
He blocks the ladder and pulls it out of his hands

429
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:01,630
and hits him with it. And Jerma goes down.

430
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:03,630
And this is where the ladder gets set up. What super

431
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:05,630
human strength by Glueman.

432
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:07,630
And this could be the end, ladies and gentlemen. There's the briefcase.

433
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:09,630
He's got a hold of it. Jerma's got to do

434
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:11,630
something real quick here. Grabs him

435
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:13,630
right by the coattails and pulls him down.

436
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:15,869
That was very, very close.

437
00:21:15,869 --> 00:21:18,109
And something is happening. Oh, no, no,

438
00:21:18,109 --> 00:21:20,109
no. No, don't even tell me this.

439
00:21:20,109 --> 00:21:22,420
Are you fucking serious right now?

440
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:24,779
Captain Crunch is in the crowd

441
00:21:24,779 --> 00:21:26,779
dancing and singing.

442
00:21:26,779 --> 00:21:29,470
What is he doing? And what is going on with that

443
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:31,470
microphone? What kind of fucking sorcery

444
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:33,470
is going on in the crowd right now?

445
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:35,470
You have not answered any of our phone calls.

446
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:37,470
You're just going to show up in the middle of the last

447
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:39,839
match? That's unbelievable.

448
00:21:39,839 --> 00:21:41,839
And all the while, we've got something climbing up on top.

449
00:21:41,839 --> 00:21:43,839
Jerma and Glueman are both on top. Thank God the

450
00:21:43,839 --> 00:21:45,839
cameraman got here in time. This could be the end.

451
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:47,839
Who's going to go down? Jerma with a power

452
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:49,839
bomb off of the ladder. My goodness.

453
00:21:49,839 --> 00:21:52,140
Glueman is now bleeding off of his

454
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:54,140
forehead while Captain Crunch is still dancing.

455
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:56,140
He's going to hop over that little barricade

456
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:58,140
there. Are we going to see a three-way

457
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:00,140
triple threat ladder match right now?

458
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:02,140
Is Captain Crunch going to get in the ring?

459
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:04,140
We have no idea. Looks like

460
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:06,140
he is. He's grabbing another ladder.

461
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:08,140
Here we go, ladies and gentlemen. This is what

462
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:10,140
you live for. This is what you watch

463
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:12,140
for. This is a triple threat match

464
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:14,140
now between Captain Crunch, Glueman,

465
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:16,140
and Jerma. And as we see, Jerma is going to slowly

466
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:18,140
climb up here. Everybody seems

467
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:20,140
to be distracted. Jerma is very tired

468
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:22,140
going for that briefcase. Nobody is paying any

469
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:24,140
attention to him. He gets knocked over

470
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:26,140
hanging by the briefcase, and he gets picked up

471
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:28,140
by Captain Crunch and slammed on his back.

472
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:30,140
What calamity. What insanity.

473
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:32,140
And Captain Crunch, while Glueman is

474
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:34,140
lying down, Captain Crunch might be

475
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:36,140
setting up for Crunch attires me. Captain,

476
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:38,140
that's what it is. There it is, ladies and

477
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:40,140
gentlemen. That's his signature move.

478
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:42,140
He perfected that for many years.

479
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:44,140
And I just got to say this. I want to stake this

480
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:46,140
very clearly while we have a second here.

481
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:48,140
Bill, how have you not said

482
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:50,140
one single word during this

483
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:52,140
entire broadcast?

484
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:54,140
How the fuck is that even possible?

485
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:56,140
I kind of just like to watch.

486
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:59,009
Alright, well, whatever.

487
00:22:59,009 --> 00:23:01,009
Back to the action now. It seems like all three

488
00:23:01,009 --> 00:23:03,009
competitors are standing on their feet,

489
00:23:03,009 --> 00:23:05,009
which is a pretty rare occurrence in a

490
00:23:05,009 --> 00:23:07,009
ladder match. And this could be a good

491
00:23:07,009 --> 00:23:09,009
opportunity here. Yup, that's a great idea.

492
00:23:09,009 --> 00:23:11,009
Double teaming on Captain Crunch.

493
00:23:11,009 --> 00:23:13,009
He's a fresh competitor. He has

494
00:23:13,009 --> 00:23:15,009
not been running around. He's been just in the crowd

495
00:23:15,009 --> 00:23:17,009
hanging out. Good idea to take

496
00:23:17,009 --> 00:23:19,009
him down. And what is Jerma doing?

497
00:23:19,009 --> 00:23:21,009
Why did he throw down that ladder into

498
00:23:21,009 --> 00:23:23,009
the turnbuckle? That doesn't seem like it makes very much

499
00:23:23,009 --> 00:23:25,009
sense at all. And Captain Crunch just gets a

500
00:23:25,009 --> 00:23:27,009
triple beating. Punches in his face.

501
00:23:27,009 --> 00:23:29,009
And Jerma with a nice fireman's carry

502
00:23:29,009 --> 00:23:31,009
throws him over. And here comes

503
00:23:31,009 --> 00:23:33,009
the ladder again. Setting it up this time

504
00:23:33,009 --> 00:23:35,009
was maybe thinking about doing something in that corner

505
00:23:35,009 --> 00:23:37,009
but did not capitalize while

506
00:23:37,009 --> 00:23:39,009
Glooman picks up a ladder. Jerma's just going to go up.

507
00:23:39,009 --> 00:23:41,009
Jerma's just going to go. What is he doing?

508
00:23:41,009 --> 00:23:43,009
Why would you do that? He just

509
00:23:43,009 --> 00:23:45,009
tried to climb the ladder in front of Captain Crunch

510
00:23:45,009 --> 00:23:47,009
and speaking of Captain Crunch, he's in Glooman's signature

511
00:23:47,009 --> 00:23:49,009
move, the tombstone. Captain Crunch

512
00:23:49,009 --> 00:23:51,009
reverses it. Does the tombstone to

513
00:23:51,009 --> 00:23:53,009
Glooman. This is it.

514
00:23:53,009 --> 00:23:55,009
Get the ladder. Get the ladder and climb up. No.

515
00:23:55,009 --> 00:23:57,009
He's signaling for his finishing move.

516
00:23:57,009 --> 00:23:59,009
The captain's kick. There it is.

517
00:23:59,009 --> 00:24:01,009
Captain's kick. This is going to be

518
00:24:01,009 --> 00:24:03,009
the end right here. He's picking him up. Why are you picking him up?

519
00:24:03,009 --> 00:24:05,009
Put him back down and climb the ladder.

520
00:24:05,009 --> 00:24:07,009
He just got way too cocky right there

521
00:24:07,009 --> 00:24:09,009
and it could be his downfall while

522
00:24:09,009 --> 00:24:11,009
Glooman goes over to pick up the other ladder.

523
00:24:11,009 --> 00:24:13,009
Where is he setting this up? What's he doing?

524
00:24:13,009 --> 00:24:15,009
Captain Crunch runs into it and blocks it.

525
00:24:15,009 --> 00:24:17,009
What are they doing? He's going to go for a swing.

526
00:24:17,009 --> 00:24:19,009
They're both running into each other. This is it.

527
00:24:19,009 --> 00:24:21,009
Captain Crunch with a beautiful double-handed swing

528
00:24:21,009 --> 00:24:23,009
and pay attention to

529
00:24:23,009 --> 00:24:25,009
Jerma, guys. He has been sitting down like

530
00:24:25,009 --> 00:24:27,009
that for the last minute or so.

531
00:24:27,009 --> 00:24:29,009
He has not gotten up and Glooman

532
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:31,009
also on the ground. Captain Crunch has

533
00:24:31,009 --> 00:24:33,009
an opportunity. Got both of his hands

534
00:24:33,009 --> 00:24:35,009
on it. Is this going to be the end? That's the end.

535
00:24:35,009 --> 00:24:37,009
That is the end, ladies and gentlemen.

536
00:24:37,009 --> 00:24:39,009
Captain Crunch is the

537
00:24:39,009 --> 00:24:41,009
Jerma Wrestling Federation

538
00:24:41,009 --> 00:24:43,009
Champion. What an absolutely

539
00:24:43,009 --> 00:24:45,009
absurd,

540
00:24:45,009 --> 00:24:47,009
insane ending to a

541
00:24:47,009 --> 00:24:49,009
crazy night. I had no

542
00:24:49,009 --> 00:24:51,009
idea that Captain Crunch was going to be showing up to the

543
00:24:51,009 --> 00:24:53,009
arena. What's in that briefcase? Nobody

544
00:24:53,009 --> 00:24:55,009
will ever know. It's probably like 30

545
00:24:55,009 --> 00:24:57,009
bucks. So it was definitely worth it.

546
00:24:57,009 --> 00:24:59,009
All this trouble for Captain Crunch

547
00:24:59,009 --> 00:25:01,009
to come down here and win that briefcase.

548
00:25:01,009 --> 00:25:03,009
So thank you all so much for

549
00:25:03,009 --> 00:25:05,009
watching. It's been an absolute pleasure

550
00:25:05,009 --> 00:25:07,009
bringing you Germania 2014.

551
00:25:07,009 --> 00:25:09,009
And we'll see you next time.

552
00:25:09,009 --> 00:25:11,009
Take care, everybody, and have a wonderful

553
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:13,009
night.
