00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:14,970
Hello, how are you? That's good. That's good. That's good. I'm on time. Of course I am.

2
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:33,060
We've got a day of festivities today. At least a few festivities. Gonna be playing Beam NG Drive,

3
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:42,820
which I was gonna do scary horror stuff today, but I just didn't feel like it. I'll be honest.

4
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:49,909
I just didn't want to do it. So this game's kind of complicated. This is a lot of going on in this

5
00:00:49,909 --> 00:00:53,909
game. I don't really know what I'm going to do. Seems like you kind of really need to figure out

6
00:00:53,909 --> 00:00:59,750
how to play it first. So this is going to be tutorial Andy for a little while. If it's too

7
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:05,739
complicated for my tiny brain, then I will move on to Webbed. I've been wanting to play Webbed for

8
00:01:05,739 --> 00:01:14,219
a little while. You're a coward. You've literally played this game before. I have not played this

9
00:01:14,219 --> 00:01:19,849
game before. No, no, no. You're confusing it with every other time I've crashed a car and laughed.

10
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:24,540
I know there's been hundreds of times. Potentially thousands of times.

11
00:01:27,189 --> 00:01:30,390
I mean this whole stream you could probably put next to one of the other games where you crash cars

12
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:38,180
and it'd probably be the same stream. It would be the same stream. But first and foremost,

13
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:49,640
well hold on. I have to warn you. I may have fucked this up pretty badly. I may have,

14
00:01:51,379 --> 00:01:56,260
well I don't, whatever. I'm gonna wait till there's more than 5k people here.

15
00:01:56,819 --> 00:03:40,150
I'm gonna just chill. Give me a second. Hold on. Okay. Hello. I said to get something real quick.

16
00:03:42,629 --> 00:03:54,710
Mod check? What? This is a sleep stream? Why would I do a sleep stream? What are you talking about?

17
00:03:54,710 --> 00:04:03,960
Let me see. Hold on. I just ran up and down stairs. Hold on. Okay. Laughing at car crash compilation?

18
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:13,189
Let me learn how to play the game first. You guys are going to laugh and I don't,

19
00:04:13,909 --> 00:04:23,980
you're going to laugh. Everybody's going to laugh because here's your glove.

20
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:33,259
Fits perfectly. As you see, it fits perfectly. I had this custom fit to make sure I could,

21
00:04:33,259 --> 00:04:45,129
you know, wear it. I promise, I promise I didn't sit on it. I didn't sit on this and get really

22
00:04:45,129 --> 00:05:00,300
mad and get very upset that I sat on it. I wonder how this glove tastes. Homer Simpson? Is that,

23
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:24,310
what is that? Is that leather? Okay. You sat on it? Now that's fresh leather. What are these

24
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:34,279
gloves even supposed to be made out of? Hold on. Hold on. I wish I had two. This looks like,

25
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:40,819
oh, this looks like fucking SpongeBob got rubbed by a car and I like stole this.

26
00:05:46,120 --> 00:06:03,689
Ooh. Ow. Bull, watch out. My thumb. Hold on. Ow. What the hell is he doing?

27
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:15,300
You know what I've realized about this channel? I'm starting to realize it more and more.

28
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:23,060
If you don't watch every single fucking stream, you're just, you're not going to have any idea

29
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:29,180
what's going on. I like feel bad for the people that like I catch like a stream once every like

30
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:36,810
couple of weeks. What the fuck are you doing? Stop. What are you doing? Stop this. Pretty good.

31
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:50,300
I can't make a middle finger. There's not five fingers. You have more lower than Dark Souls.

32
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:53,579
I don't think that's accurate. I just think that there's weird shit that happens like every other

33
00:06:53,579 --> 00:07:14,389
day. What finger should I bite next? Put your middle finger through the middle. Yeah. Hold on.

34
00:07:14,389 --> 00:07:29,300
You know what? Yeah. Fuck you. It's too hard to do it. Uh, flipped. Get the pinky. That's pinky

35
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:36,230
right here, right? Looks like I have like egg in my mouth. All I didn't tell you is it's made

36
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:51,829
out of fucking eggs. Oh, it looks like egg. Hmm. What is that? Is that edible? Boy, I think that's

37
00:07:51,829 --> 00:08:09,610
not edible. I don't think that part's edible. That part's not edible. I think that's stuffing.

38
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:16,259
There you go. Okay. All right. I ate another glove. Okay. All right. I'm done. I'm done. I'm out.

39
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:30,310
I'm done. Wait, I got one more, one more bite for the camera. I'm not eating at all. What about

40
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:39,129
like, I can't swallow this. It's fucking pure sugar. I mean, pure leather. I just spit this out.

41
00:08:39,129 --> 00:08:53,639
Oh, I'm gonna puke. I'm not eating the whole glove. I'm not eating the whole glove. I'm taking a few

42
00:08:53,639 --> 00:09:02,779
bites. I didn't eat the whole shoe. You guys didn't hear that, did you? I hope not. I didn't eat the

43
00:09:02,779 --> 00:09:20,460
whole shoe. Why would I eat the whole glove? Come on. I can't. Okay. How about like right here? This

44
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:25,059
looks so fucking weird. Give him the silent treatment. He has to finish the glove. I'm not

45
00:09:25,059 --> 00:09:36,940
finishing the glove. I'll take one more bite right here for the thumbnail. Like, this is

46
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:42,980
fucking weird. Don't give me the silent treatment. Give me something else. By the way, I'm never,

47
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:47,720
I'm never saying this again. I was, if you're curious what's going on, let me just explain

48
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:51,690
real quick for people who have no idea what's going on. I was convinced that the three stooges

49
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:56,169
were going to be in Fortnite. Two years ago, I made a bet. I said the three stooges will be in

50
00:09:56,169 --> 00:10:02,490
Fortnite by some, what, last week of April, 2022. It didn't happen, which is horseshit. Like, I don't

51
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:06,570
know why they wouldn't have been added. They probably will get added. I still believe that.

52
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:13,179
I genuinely believe the three stooges are going to be in Fortnite. I believe it genuinely. It's

53
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:18,620
just a matter of time. So look, you can come back to this video whenever the three stooges get added

54
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:22,460
and be like, holy shit, he actually had to eat that glove thing and they actually got added.

55
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:35,830
But if the three stooges are not added to Fortnite by April 3rd of 2030, I will have already been

56
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:45,059
retired. So who cares? Okay. Goodbye. My hands are so sticky. I'll be right back. I'll be right back.

57
00:10:45,059 --> 00:10:53,029
We'll go back to the intro. I'm going to put this in the freezer. Yeah. I'm going, I'm going to the

58
00:10:53,029 --> 00:11:00,600
freezer. I'll be back. I'm so, oh, this is bad. I can't touch anything. Yeah, I can. Here we go.

59
00:11:00,600 --> 00:14:48,659
Okay. Hi. Everything's, I just, my hands are all sugar all over them. This was a very sugary

60
00:14:48,659 --> 00:15:10,309
leather glove. Okay. You ate a glove? Yeah. You missed it. It was crazy. Yeah. So we're doing

61
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:18,600
BMNG. Uh, I know people are saying, dude, you gotta, oh, BMNG, man. I'm gonna go get this mod

62
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,879
and go get that mod and go get that to download that thing. I go download that car pack and get

63
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:27,559
this. Let's start. Look, I'm, this is baby steps. I never played this. Let me just see if I enjoy,

64
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:35,100
I'm going to do the tutorial. I'm going to get familiar with the controls, uh, and we'll see

65
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:48,360
what happens. Understand? It has car accidents. Oh, of course. Of course. If the three stooges were

66
00:15:48,360 --> 00:16:02,789
still around, would they be fans of your stream? No. Why would they even know who I was? They would

67
00:16:02,789 --> 00:16:09,419
watch dollhouse and go, I could have done that better. Look at these kids think they're so funny

68
00:16:09,419 --> 00:16:18,090
these days. You went through a window. I used to go through a window every Saturday. Really? This

69
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:27,669
younger generation doesn't understand slapstick comedy. All right, so let's go. We're going to

70
00:16:27,669 --> 00:16:31,990
play BMNG. Uh, if the game is too complicated for me, if I want to pivot, we're just going to

71
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:40,009
pivot to webbed, which is a spider game. And we play as a spider. It looks pretty cute. You know,

72
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:49,450
how did your stomach feel after the last stream? It was, I was okay. I mean, it was a little,

73
00:16:50,679 --> 00:16:55,799
it was a little, but it wasn't that bad. I didn't eat that much of each candy. I only had one or

74
00:16:55,799 --> 00:16:59,639
two bites of each thing. I've always eaten whole candy bars. Then. Oh yeah. I would have, I probably

75
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:08,200
would have felt terrible. Okay. So BMNG, that's the camera's way too big. This is trouble. I haven't

76
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:15,259
had, I've been doing Cam Andy recently. You notice that? This is the most I've ever used

77
00:17:15,259 --> 00:17:24,869
face cam in the 10, 12 years I've been doing this. I just don't do this. And I never use this.

78
00:17:24,869 --> 00:17:29,640
And for some reason after Elden Ring, it just became, I just got used to turning it on

79
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:36,599
every day. Where's blood wash? I wanted to chill. I wanted to chill today and it's too scary. We'll

80
00:17:36,599 --> 00:17:40,200
do that a little bit later. We'll do that like next week. Not next week, like later this week.

81
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:44,789
We'll do that later this week. I have it downloaded. I have it ready to go. I just,

82
00:17:44,789 --> 00:17:50,980
I didn't want to just be screaming. My head kind of hurts. All right. Campaign. I need to do the

83
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:55,140
driver's training course because I have no idea what the hell I'm doing. So bear with me.

84
00:17:56,230 --> 00:18:06,920
Senseless destruction? All right. Driver training. This game takes like 5,000 horsepower to run,

85
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:13,059
right? Hopefully my computer is going to handle it. I can use a controller for this, right?

86
00:18:13,059 --> 00:18:26,490
It's all CPU. My CPU is all right. Okay. Accelerating and braking. Welcome to the

87
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:32,019
ETK Driver Experience Center. My name is Mike and I'll be your instructor for this course.

88
00:18:32,019 --> 00:18:35,140
Let's start out nice and easy. All you have to do is accelerate and then stop before you hit the

89
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:43,140
barriers. Make sure you brake when you reach the stop sign. Okay. How do you accelerate?

90
00:18:43,140 --> 00:19:00,970
Apparently using arcade gearbox behavior. What the fuck does that mean? Is it X? Orbit. How do I do it?

91
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:10,009
I thought it's not right trigger or left trigger? Press Q. Realistic behavior. Arcade behavior.

92
00:19:10,009 --> 00:19:30,339
How do you drive? Up? How do I drive? What happened? What? All right. So I was paused. All right. So

93
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:34,900
right trigger is accelerate. Left trigger is brake. So brake right before I get here.

94
00:19:42,069 --> 00:19:54,950
Did I do it? What? How did I fail? That doesn't make any sense. What? Too slow? I was driving so

95
00:19:54,950 --> 00:20:04,900
insanely fast. That was scary how fast I was going. Oh, we didn't want you to... We wanted you to go

96
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:19,740
over 60. So start braking now. What the fuck? I don't get it. I don't get it. What does it want

97
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:31,930
me to do? Stop at the stop sign. What? Do you want me to stop like at the stop sign like here?

98
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:42,259
That's where the stop sign is. What do you want me to do? I stopped at the stop sign.

99
00:20:45,019 --> 00:20:53,859
Stop before you hit the barriers. I didn't... I did that the first time. I actually did that the

100
00:20:53,859 --> 00:20:59,930
first time. Stop in the zone. I just literally just did that. I just did that. I just did that.

101
00:21:07,109 --> 00:21:12,259
I did that already. All right. All right. I get it. I get it. I get it. I get it. I literally just

102
00:21:12,259 --> 00:21:16,420
did that. I literally, literally, literally, literally, literally, literally just did it.

103
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:22,789
Yeah, I did. I went and stopped in the middle and said, failure. You're an idiot. This isn't

104
00:21:22,789 --> 00:21:28,069
a real fucking driving game. Give me a real course and I'll be fine. Okay. In the unlikely

105
00:21:28,069 --> 00:21:31,990
event that the road is not straight, you may need to stop accelerating and use your car's steering

106
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:41,269
wheel. Okay. Try it here on the roundabout, but watch out for the slippery area. Just drive the

107
00:21:41,269 --> 00:22:02,410
car. This is part of the fucking driving test. Yeah. We want you to go 60 and then smash on the

108
00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:08,220
brakes before you get to the driving zone. Go around this roundabout going 50. All right.

109
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:22,539
Go. You're gonna move the cam so we can see the speedometer. Oh, oops. Get up here. All right.

110
00:22:22,539 --> 00:22:26,460
So you master the turning left. Can you navigate a narrow road? Try to find the proper speed for

111
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:47,509
those tight corners. Two, one, go. I fucking failed already. Time limit doesn't matter. I'm

112
00:22:47,589 --> 00:23:02,549
being timed. All right. Is there a handbrake? In all driving games, I never use the actual brake.

113
00:23:02,549 --> 00:23:10,519
I use handbrake only. Anybody else like that? R1? Yeah. I only use the handbrake in video games.

114
00:23:13,059 --> 00:23:17,269
I don't think I've ever hit left trigger in a video game when it's a car game. Okay. So

115
00:23:17,269 --> 00:23:30,119
handbrake. Got it. How much was the glove? You'd like to know. Changing lanes at highway speeds

116
00:23:30,119 --> 00:23:34,119
require a gentle hand on the steering wheel. Do you have what it takes to control an 80s supercar?

117
00:23:44,619 --> 00:23:48,779
Apparently not. What the fuck was that? Why is it covered in like grease?

118
00:23:49,420 --> 00:24:17,640
I did it. That was easy. Well done. Who made the glove? I told you. I was gonna just like

119
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:22,710
fucking ruin everybody's childhood. I was gonna say, I told you. SpongeBob got run over and I

120
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:30,140
found it. But no, that's not what happened. It was great. It was fake. It was a real glove. Shut up.

121
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:49,849
Stick to the speed limits on the signs to guarantee success. Okay. 25 miles per hour. Okay.

122
00:24:50,569 --> 00:25:00,619
25 still? I think so. It's all right. I didn't fail it. I didn't fail it. I didn't even get

123
00:25:00,619 --> 00:25:24,380
bumped. I'm fine. Too realistic. It's too realistic. Why would I be doing this in this car, by the way?

124
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:30,599
This is dad's cigarette car. I mean, this is just the car that just smells like cigarettes.

125
00:25:30,599 --> 00:25:40,809
This is the dad's cigarette car. How did I fail it? What did I do wrong? Is there a time limit?

126
00:25:40,809 --> 00:25:50,779
What happened? What happened? I don't understand. Read the signs. 25. That's what I was just doing.

127
00:25:55,509 --> 00:26:13,990
40. Dude, it's fucking hard. Hold on. Guaranteed my success. That was actually really hard to do

128
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:26,940
that. This car sucks. It's actually hard. I can't even turn. All guaranteed success at 40 miles per

129
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:42,549
hour. 40 miles per hour drifting? That's not gonna happen. Okay. 25. I'm not going 40 through this.

130
00:26:42,549 --> 00:26:58,329
That's way too fucking much. That's impossible to go 40 through this. 50? Guys, it's not possible.

131
00:26:58,329 --> 00:27:16,119
It's not possible to go 50. And look at my fucking serious. Whatever. Just start over.

132
00:27:16,119 --> 00:27:35,059
Fuck it. Whatever. I wasn't going 60, dude. What? I have to drift. Okay. Drift? How do you drift?

133
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:45,420
I am holding. Okay. I am literally holding right and like drifting into it and he just drives

134
00:27:45,420 --> 00:28:07,609
straight into the wall. I'm gonna fail this tutorial. I don't get this. Okay. 40. Big drift.

135
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:22,460
Why did you give me this piece of shit car? Okay. 50. It's the car's out of fucking control. It's

136
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:34,390
out of control. The car is out of control. I can't control the car. This fucking thing's out of

137
00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:51,259
control. I can't control it. Did I do it? All right. Good. It's a skill issue. That's fine.

138
00:28:51,259 --> 00:28:56,859
It is. I don't hand run. I've set up a circuit for you to practice what you've learned. Should

139
00:28:56,859 --> 00:29:34,579
be pretty easy. Two laps. No surprises. I have to beat this? No, I don't. All right. I'm good.

140
00:29:35,059 --> 00:29:54,839
Fuck you. God damn it. All right. I'm going too fast. There are no posted speed limits here.

141
00:29:54,839 --> 00:30:18,230
So how am I supposed to know what the fuck to do? I'm hand braking. It's not working. All right.

142
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:53,700
Slow down. Slow down. Okay. I'm good. Good. All right. I got it. That's it. Right. Nice. All right.

143
00:30:53,700 --> 00:31:07,000
I'm good. Stop hand braking. All right. Hair pins. No fucking way. I'm not gonna be able to do this.

144
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:13,690
Hold the handbrake to slide around a hairpin. Just like in the movies. Not with a car like this.

145
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:43,690
Listen to my calls. I'm going too fast. Okay. What? 30? 20 miles per hour? That's not in the

146
00:31:43,690 --> 00:31:54,869
movies. They don't go 15 miles per hour in the movies. There it is.

147
00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:48,869
What? I fucking... How am I supposed to go that fast? Go! Got it. Very cool.

148
00:32:48,869 --> 00:32:58,859
What do you do in this game? Slalom. A slalom course is a hard thing to master. Get a feel

149
00:32:58,859 --> 00:33:13,299
for the weight of the car as you weave between the cones. He's gonna rage at this game. I thought

150
00:33:13,299 --> 00:33:39,990
I was gonna get points off. Not fail completely. Oh, just barely. I want a car like that. Go get

151
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:52,309
mods. I'm... Rear wheel drive handling. Ruckle moonhawk handles like a boat. So if you can finish

152
00:33:52,309 --> 00:33:59,190
a lap of this circuit first try, you're doing better than most of my students. All right.

153
00:33:59,190 --> 00:34:09,690
Don't get mods. I'm not gonna yet. How the fuck do you drive a car like this? This car's on treads.

154
00:34:09,690 --> 00:34:38,570
It's not even on wheels. I just drive straight. The mirror. Oh my god. How are you supposed to

155
00:34:38,570 --> 00:34:50,460
drive this car? How do you actually drive a car like this? This thing's on ice. This car's on ice.

156
00:34:51,659 --> 00:35:14,550
I can't drive it. Okay. I'm just gonna go really slow. Use the rear brakes? What? All right. Rear

157
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:43,610
brakes. What do you mean rear brakes? I don't know what that means. I'm all right. I've had a fucking

158
00:35:43,610 --> 00:35:53,260
time. This thing sucks. This thing sucks. Ride driving. Well, this car is impossible to use.

159
00:35:53,260 --> 00:36:29,980
What the fuck, dude? Why would anybody drive this? I fuck... I'm skipping. I'm done. I'm not playing

160
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:35,849
that one. No fucking way. It's not happening. Like, why would you drive that car? Oh man,

161
00:36:35,849 --> 00:36:43,579
that's a beauty. How often do you drive it? Well, when you want to get in the car with me,

162
00:36:43,579 --> 00:36:50,469
we'll take a ride. And you just literally drive directly into the first wall. Well,

163
00:36:50,469 --> 00:36:55,480
I didn't even read that. Whatever. I wasn't gonna make a joke, but I was like, no, why even make a

164
00:36:55,480 --> 00:37:27,210
joke? That car's not even worth making a joke about. I don't care. This sounds like a cat.

165
00:37:27,769 --> 00:37:35,750
I'm just braking all the way. I'm going to a complete stop and driving the car again.

166
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:50,150
This is so bad for the car. I'm supposed to be drifting. God damn it. Skip it. Stop accelerating

167
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:54,710
so hard. I don't play games like this. I play like fucking Mario Kart. I don't even play that

168
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:58,630
game. I don't like that one either. I don't play games with cars in them. Unless I like the...

169
00:37:58,630 --> 00:38:04,619
Unless it's like GTA. All right. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What's this?

170
00:38:04,619 --> 00:38:10,380
Use a manual transmission for this test. Stay in second gear. Slide the car sideways to score as

171
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:22,440
many points as you can. All right, let's go. Why am I going backwards? Why is the car in...

172
00:38:22,440 --> 00:39:09,539
Oh, the car's in reverse. I forgot it was manual. I forgot it was manual. Yeah. Yeah.

173
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:23,900
That's not a man-sized drift. Oops. I don't give a shit. That was fine. All right. Campaigns.

174
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:31,480
Senseless destruction. Go back. Go back. All right. Somebody said just do free roam. Oh, okay.

175
00:39:34,090 --> 00:39:46,710
Where do I go? West Coast, USA. Dockyards, industrial area. Just like Chinatown. What should I...

176
00:39:46,710 --> 00:40:04,199
Just default. Okay. Well, I didn't know what I just did. I hit A too much fast. I pressed A and I

177
00:40:04,199 --> 00:40:25,269
didn't do anything. This is bright. Retract bed. Extend feet. Tilt bed up. Whoa. Okay. Hold on.

178
00:40:25,269 --> 00:40:42,840
I'm trying to go over the sand jump. How do I fix the car? Okay. This thing is fucked. What do I do?

179
00:40:43,559 --> 00:41:02,599
Can I fix the car? How do I fix it? Press R. Oh, okay. Left on the D-pad. Oh, all right. Cool.

180
00:41:02,599 --> 00:41:30,090
You're a bus? Holy shit. I was ejected. I was ejected from the fucking car. This is still

181
00:41:30,090 --> 00:41:41,030
drivable. Oh my God. What the hell was that? I got ejected in an escape pod. You got vaporized.

182
00:41:41,030 --> 00:41:46,739
All right. We'll put on traffic. How do I put traffic on? Use your steering wheel. I just was

183
00:41:46,739 --> 00:41:56,949
like curious. What's going on? Hit escape. Is it... Oh, hold on. Manage. Fun stuff. Fire. Boom. Break.

184
00:41:56,949 --> 00:42:19,320
Extinguish. Oh, this is a jump right here. No, no, no. I thought I was gonna be able to drive over it.

185
00:42:18,949 --> 00:42:28,360
All right. What? How do I get rid of that? No, no, no, no. Power. Pedestrian. I don't want to put

186
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:45,530
pedestrians on. No, powertrain. Manage. Clone. Home. AI. Traffic. Spawn. Police. Spawn. Normal.

187
00:42:46,090 --> 00:43:05,480
Wait, this traffic? Where are they? Change cars? Yeah. How do I get out of this fucking pickup?

188
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:11,719
I don't want to be on a pickup truck. You can fuck with gravity too. Really? Is there a different

189
00:43:11,719 --> 00:43:24,059
camera? How do I get a different camera? Is there a different camera? Vehicle camera. Orbit. Turn

190
00:43:24,059 --> 00:43:41,179
the police on. If they press escape. Manage. Switch. Or select. Holy shit. Okay. What else is here?

191
00:43:41,179 --> 00:44:11,639
I can be in a tractor trailer? What? Oh my god. Okay. I want this one. Argo doors. Is it... Oh.

192
00:44:12,199 --> 00:44:28,949
How do I do that? Check the controls. Yeah. I'll check them. So where should I go? I just...

193
00:44:31,559 --> 00:44:35,400
Can I like just sit and watch the camera? Can I hold control?

194
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:47,059
I feel like I'm playing GTA V. I'm... I can't... I'm not in control anymore.

195
00:44:55,500 --> 00:45:05,159
This feels so... All right. Reset. Reset. Give me... I want a different car. I want a fast car.

196
00:45:05,159 --> 00:45:42,550
Okay. I want... Wait a minute. I can... Hello? Did I... Did I just run that guy over?

197
00:45:42,550 --> 00:45:48,230
I just ran that guy's whole car over. Hold control and put your mouse over the car.

198
00:45:52,739 --> 00:46:05,300
What? Okay. Am I gonna drown? Hold control. Put your mouse over the car? Strength. Force.

199
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:19,530
I'm so confused. Strength. Force. Middle click to hang from here. I'm in the water dude. Why are you

200
00:46:19,530 --> 00:46:38,980
beeping at me? I don't get it. What? What? I can just pull shit off the car? Like it's a Lego set?

201
00:46:50,469 --> 00:47:35,190
Excuse me? Use the scroll wheel. What the fuck? Oh. Stay here. Stay here. What am I doing to this car?

202
00:47:35,190 --> 00:47:54,579
Okay. Now pull this way too. Holy shit. Drive while tethered to the ground.

203
00:48:12,570 --> 00:48:19,929
High clutch temperature? Clutch overheating. I just burnt out the clutch.

204
00:48:24,619 --> 00:48:49,860
Okay. But should I try a different car? Okay. Give me a fucking... This is crazy. I didn't know

205
00:48:49,860 --> 00:49:00,579
this game was like this. Fog light? Okay. Manage. Select new car. Something small and fat. Are there

206
00:49:00,579 --> 00:49:14,170
motorcycles? All right. This one right here. Yeah. Right here. Let's go. Fucking Robin's egg blue.

207
00:49:14,570 --> 00:50:02,760
Oh yeah. Hell yeah. The jumps and stuff? Put on slow-mo. Whoa. How do I do slow-mo? Give me a

208
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:12,860
redo it. Go a hundred thousand miles per hour. What? You can go a hundred thousand miles per hour?

209
00:50:13,659 --> 00:50:17,420
Let me just... Hold on. There's a lot going on in this game. Let me get on the highway.

210
00:50:17,980 --> 00:50:29,480
Drive a GPS. You should just leave the planet. Alt and down. Alt down. Eight times slower than real

211
00:50:29,480 --> 00:51:07,980
time. What? Alt up. Holy shit. Okay. Let me get on the highway. How do you beep the horn? Oh. No,

212
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:17,849
no. I need to go faster than that. No. I don't want to be back here. I don't want to be back here.

213
00:51:17,849 --> 00:51:32,230
I want to be back up with that error. How do I do a flip? Add a ramp. Okay. Set home. Clone.

214
00:51:32,309 --> 00:51:56,230
Does it have AI? Okay. Manage. Okay. Select. Wall. Mat. What should I put up here? How about a cannon?

215
00:51:56,230 --> 00:52:04,789
Oh, here we go. I need a ramp. Hamster wheel. Oh, hell yeah. How do I move this? Okay. So,

216
00:52:04,789 --> 00:52:26,570
how do I... Can I move this? How do I pick up a car? All right. I need to get in there.

217
00:52:26,570 --> 00:52:40,710
Is it going to work? Oh my God, dude. You can't drive over the curb because the car is too low

218
00:52:40,710 --> 00:52:57,050
to the ground. Are you fucking kidding me? God damn it. All right. Just give me the other

219
00:52:57,050 --> 00:53:03,420
fucking car. Give me the other car. I don't... What the fuck? This is a debug menu? What can I do

220
00:53:03,420 --> 00:53:13,239
with this? All right. Can I actually use this for other crazy shit? Can I actually do it?

221
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:40,280
What can I do with that? SV cheats? All right. Get me up here. Way too dang. These cars cannot

222
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:52,010
go... Okay. Oh, there's another entrance. I feel like I'm playing in the bowling alley. I'm playing

223
00:53:52,010 --> 00:53:59,260
fucking with the bumpers on the other side. I can't go anywhere with this car. This is ridiculous.

224
00:54:00,329 --> 00:54:24,619
Reverse over it. What the fuck is happening? Am I out on the street? Huh?

225
00:54:32,469 --> 00:54:48,820
Going to free cam mode. Control C. Oh, nice. All right. Here we go. Dude, you've really... These

226
00:54:48,820 --> 00:54:57,559
cars are terrible. These cars can't do anything. This is just a giant toy that sits in your garage.

227
00:54:57,559 --> 00:55:39,139
I can't actually use this. Here we go. It's going faster. Oh shit. Oh my God. It's going so fast.

228
00:55:44,650 --> 00:55:57,769
Oh, I am going full throttle. High clutch temperature. What does that mean? How do I

229
00:55:57,769 --> 00:56:31,289
stop that? Hit the brake. Was it control? What's the get to free cam? How do I get to free cam?

230
00:56:39,059 --> 00:56:57,880
I'm stuck in here. Control C. That's driver cam. F7? Shift C. Okay. I'm in free camera.

231
00:56:58,599 --> 00:57:33,960
I'm in free camera. No. Okay. I think that's pretty good view. How do I... What's the horn? I... Engine

232
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:45,219
oil is... I can't even turn. That just scared the fuck out of me. I don't know what to do about this.

233
00:57:45,219 --> 00:58:03,880
Where's the other car? There's another car somewhere. Oh, what happened? What? How did I

234
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:16,659
miss that? What just happened? I thought I was driving another car. What's going on? I'm driving

235
00:58:16,659 --> 00:58:40,059
the hamster wheel. I'm driving the wheel. Are you serious? What the fuck are you talking about?

236
00:58:40,059 --> 00:58:52,699
All right. Let's put a Mac truck in here. I'm going to put a Mac truck in here. Can I spawn

237
00:58:52,699 --> 00:59:15,849
like 10 cars in here? All right. How many can I spawn? Just keep pressing it? Oh, what? Come on.

238
00:59:15,849 --> 00:59:41,460
Get over here. Remove traffic. Damn it. Oh my fucking God. I just want to... What is all this?

239
00:59:41,460 --> 00:59:55,420
What do I hit? Tuning? This is insane. I don't... I just want to pick the car up. There we go. No,

240
00:59:55,420 --> 01:00:30,420
give me a... Give me the car. All right. Stay in there. Oh, I need another one. Okay. Is this

241
01:00:30,420 --> 01:01:09,219
going to work? Stop doing that. Oh shit. I screwed it up. Hold on. I'll get it in there. Why? I'm just

242
01:01:09,219 --> 01:01:22,650
taking pieces off. Okay. Here we go. Now I want to go control this. What am I controlling? Okay.

243
01:01:22,650 --> 01:02:17,159
Here we go. Ready? This is going so fast. F7, please. What's F7 do? F7. What happened? All right.

244
01:02:17,159 --> 01:02:24,219
Let me drive the bus. There's no way this still drives the fucking way. All right. Let me drive

245
01:02:24,219 --> 01:02:48,699
the bus. I want to go to the other area. Switch to the other map, the grid map. If you go under 50,

246
01:02:48,699 --> 01:03:12,219
you're going to explode. This game is so weird. That didn't even hurt me. This thing is indestructible.

247
01:03:12,219 --> 01:03:30,309
Left shift. What do I mean? Use the... This guy's mad. That's kind of rude. That's just really rude.

248
01:03:30,869 --> 01:03:43,110
Switch to the grid map. How do I switch to the grid map? What's grid map? Oh, we're going off

249
01:03:43,110 --> 01:04:08,500
this right now. Really? It's a different map. Okay. Hold on. Let me go off this. Is there... How do I...

250
01:04:08,500 --> 01:04:34,570
Can I just like go... I want to like... Hold on. Can I make the camera follow? How do I make the

251
01:04:34,570 --> 01:04:43,269
camera follow from here? It's F7? Why would you tell me to do that? What the fuck did you do that

252
01:04:43,269 --> 01:05:02,619
for? Now I have to go back? What is... What are these other cars? Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait,

253
01:05:02,619 --> 01:05:13,139
wait. Recam, right? So if I do that again, it should spawn up here. Wait, I'm spawning it on top?

254
01:05:13,139 --> 01:05:42,860
Hold on. Can I actually drive it up here? No. Okay. Here we go. I need to set this as my home, right?

255
01:05:42,860 --> 01:05:48,889
Set home. Yep. Okay. Here we go. All right. Now I want to... I want to go like this, but I want the

256
01:05:48,889 --> 01:05:57,909
camera to follow from here. I don't think I can do that. I'm just going to get a crazy view. All

257
01:05:57,909 --> 01:06:36,659
right. Let's see if I can make it down over there. You know, I think I'm doing a pretty good job,

258
01:06:36,659 --> 01:07:04,250
if I have to say so myself. Craziest fucking security camera. Like, what was this guy doing?

259
01:07:04,250 --> 01:07:45,110
What was this guy doing? Am I still going? What? How am I still going? How did... Honest to God?

260
01:07:45,110 --> 01:07:56,869
How did I do all that? That's... I don't even know how I did all that. That makes no sense.

261
01:07:56,869 --> 01:08:11,030
Wait, the bus is still driving. Press 1 through 9. Oh, this is what I wanted. This is what I

262
01:08:11,030 --> 01:08:29,050
wanted so badly. This is the only thing I care about in this whole game. It says not in service

263
01:08:29,050 --> 01:08:51,350
on it. That's so funny. You know, this is what would happen. There's nobody in this car. This

264
01:08:51,350 --> 01:08:57,899
is what would happen if this bus became sentient right now. It would just be like, what am I doing?

265
01:08:57,899 --> 01:09:01,340
Where am I? Why am I alive? What's happening? It would start crashing into shit. It wouldn't know

266
01:09:01,340 --> 01:09:10,060
what to do. It would be freaking out. This is what would happen. This is the future that Tesla

267
01:09:10,060 --> 01:09:16,569
wants. This car is alive right now and it doesn't get it. It doesn't understand what life is.

268
01:09:17,210 --> 01:09:22,630
It has no idea what life is. All it knows is that it can move this forward. It can move forward.

269
01:09:22,630 --> 01:09:49,779
That's it. It doesn't know anything else. It doesn't know anything. It doesn't know anything.

270
01:09:51,319 --> 01:09:57,539
I must drive. I don't know. I just have to go forward. I just have to push the forward button.

271
01:09:58,420 --> 01:10:00,020
Who am I?

272
01:10:47,260 --> 01:11:08,409
It's too much. Way too... it's way too day. Oh wait. I had the wrong one on.

273
01:11:09,750 --> 01:11:28,359
I can't breathe!

274
01:11:28,359 --> 01:11:30,359
Something feels weird in my lungs!

275
01:11:30,359 --> 01:11:34,180
Why do I have lungs? Why do I have-

276
01:11:34,180 --> 01:11:47,539
OW! OW!

277
01:11:47,539 --> 01:11:50,420
Somebody said his jigsaw!

278
01:11:50,420 --> 01:12:00,220
I'm going to break you up!

279
01:12:00,220 --> 01:12:02,779
Bus it seems. This bus

280
01:12:02,779 --> 01:12:04,779
is not like any other bus you've ever driven.

281
01:12:04,779 --> 01:12:07,460
This bus must go

282
01:12:07,460 --> 01:12:09,460
at least 40 miles per hour

283
01:12:09,460 --> 01:12:11,960
just like that movie.

284
01:12:11,960 --> 01:12:15,220
If this bus goes below 40

285
01:12:15,220 --> 01:12:17,220
I'll hide your

286
01:12:17,220 --> 01:12:19,220
tonal clippers and your tweezers in your house.

287
01:12:19,220 --> 01:12:21,220
You won't be able to find them.

288
01:12:21,220 --> 01:12:23,529
You'll be a huge pain in the ass and you'll have to

289
01:12:23,529 --> 01:12:26,600
buy a new pair of tweezers

290
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:28,600
every time you go to the store.

291
01:12:28,600 --> 01:12:30,600
It's really fucking annoying.

292
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:32,600
Whoa whoa whoa! Are you alright?

293
01:12:32,600 --> 01:12:34,779
You okay?

294
01:12:34,779 --> 01:12:41,930
You okay? Oh what the

295
01:12:41,930 --> 01:12:49,850
fuck? He's fine.

296
01:12:49,850 --> 01:12:51,850
And remember, if that goes below 40

297
01:12:51,850 --> 01:12:55,750
miles per hour, you

298
01:12:55,750 --> 01:12:57,750
hold on, I can't see the camera, I got messed up.

299
01:12:57,750 --> 01:12:59,750
Steve, go on the- you're driving

300
01:12:59,750 --> 01:13:02,380
on the wrong side of the road, Steve.

301
01:13:02,380 --> 01:13:04,380
Steve, you need to be on the right side of the road, otherwise

302
01:13:04,380 --> 01:13:06,380
my fucked up plan is you're

303
01:13:06,380 --> 01:13:08,380
stuck in the middle. Steve,

304
01:13:08,380 --> 01:13:10,380
you're stuck in the middle of the road, Steve.

305
01:13:10,380 --> 01:13:12,380
I don't think I can come get you.

306
01:13:12,380 --> 01:13:14,380
Steve, you really blew this

307
01:13:14,380 --> 01:13:16,380
whole thing. I can't come get you, Steve. You're going to have to call an Uber.

308
01:13:16,380 --> 01:13:18,380
But when you get in that

309
01:13:18,380 --> 01:13:20,380
Uber, you make sure to tell that Uber driver.

310
01:13:20,380 --> 01:13:22,739
You tell him.

311
01:13:22,739 --> 01:13:24,739
And he goes under 40 miles per hour.

312
01:13:24,739 --> 01:13:26,739
You know what? Just, just

313
01:13:26,739 --> 01:13:31,479
fuck this.

314
01:13:31,479 --> 01:13:39,220
Actually, I am stuck. How many other cameras are there?

315
01:13:39,220 --> 01:13:43,819
Top down?

316
01:13:43,819 --> 01:13:45,819
On board as a rider.

317
01:13:45,819 --> 01:13:49,529
Hey, man,

318
01:13:49,529 --> 01:13:52,090
really think you

319
01:13:52,090 --> 01:13:54,090
missed the stop back there.

320
01:13:54,090 --> 01:13:56,710
I was supposed to get off at Fourth

321
01:13:56,710 --> 01:14:00,420
Street. Yeah,

322
01:14:00,420 --> 01:14:02,659
probably

323
01:14:02,659 --> 01:14:04,659
should probably slow down a little.

324
01:14:04,659 --> 01:14:09,079
I think you're going a little too fast.

325
01:14:09,079 --> 01:14:14,579
Watch out! Watch out! That's a red light!

326
01:14:14,579 --> 01:14:18,729
Why are you not talking?

327
01:14:18,729 --> 01:14:20,729
Fucking goddamn AI drivers.

328
01:14:20,729 --> 01:14:23,909
Hello?

329
01:14:23,909 --> 01:14:25,909
Call number. 1-800 number to call for tech support.

330
01:14:25,909 --> 01:14:28,409
Fucking god damn it.

331
01:14:28,409 --> 01:14:34,680
There's something wrong with this one.

332
01:14:34,680 --> 01:14:39,930
What am I supposed to do? I can't get out of the car.

333
01:14:39,930 --> 01:14:41,930
I knew this wasn't going to be ready for at least another 20

334
01:14:41,930 --> 01:14:43,930
or 30 fucking years at least.

335
01:14:43,930 --> 01:14:45,930
And I got on the bus this time. I'm the one that gets on the bus during

336
01:14:45,930 --> 01:14:48,619
the AI shit.

337
01:14:48,619 --> 01:14:51,300
I mean, it's going.

338
01:14:51,300 --> 01:14:53,300
I wonder where it's going. What is in the GPS?

339
01:14:53,300 --> 01:14:58,979
I have no idea.

340
01:14:58,979 --> 01:15:00,979
I will never work.

341
01:15:00,979 --> 01:15:07,319
I will never

342
01:15:07,319 --> 01:15:09,319
work. This thing will accidentally

343
01:15:09,319 --> 01:15:11,319
get put into a Wendy's, right?

344
01:15:11,319 --> 01:15:13,319
It's like, oh, OK, time to go to the Wendy's.

345
01:15:13,319 --> 01:15:15,319
It's like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

346
01:15:15,319 --> 01:15:17,319
For some reason, like the Wendy's will just go in the GPS.

347
01:15:17,319 --> 01:15:30,380
It's like, I didn't want to go to Wendy's. I'm supposed to go home.

348
01:15:30,380 --> 01:15:34,659
I'm trying to go home.

349
01:15:34,659 --> 01:15:40,100
And see, the AI didn't

350
01:15:40,100 --> 01:15:42,100
know that this is a new road.

351
01:15:42,100 --> 01:15:44,100
It didn't know the road split right there.

352
01:15:44,100 --> 01:15:46,100
It thought the road went straight. So it doesn't

353
01:15:46,100 --> 01:15:48,100
updated the firmware. I don't want any firmware

354
01:15:48,100 --> 01:15:52,779
updates it's going to fucking take.

355
01:15:52,779 --> 01:15:54,779
This car is crushed up, man.

356
01:15:54,779 --> 01:15:59,960
It's crumpled.

357
01:15:59,960 --> 01:16:01,960
I'm going. I don't.

358
01:16:01,960 --> 01:16:03,960
I can't really see. I don't know.

359
01:16:03,960 --> 01:16:07,159
Oh, hey, I was gone.

360
01:16:07,159 --> 01:16:18,409
I'm back. Put rockets on the bus.

361
01:16:18,409 --> 01:16:20,409
I mean, the back of the bus is fine. The front of the bus

362
01:16:20,409 --> 01:16:24,949
is kind of fucked up. I can't turn.

363
01:16:24,949 --> 01:16:28,979
Oh, boy.

364
01:16:28,979 --> 01:16:33,590
Oh, boy.

365
01:16:33,590 --> 01:16:35,590
I'm serious. Right now?

366
01:16:35,590 --> 01:16:37,590
Right now? I am.

367
01:16:37,590 --> 01:16:39,590
I'm jumping out of the car. You know what I mean? Like if this is like

368
01:16:39,590 --> 01:16:41,590
AI, just like the GPS got

369
01:16:41,590 --> 01:16:43,590
fucked up and it just doesn't know what it's doing.

370
01:16:43,590 --> 01:16:45,590
I'm going out this window right now. I'm just diving out.

371
01:16:45,590 --> 01:16:52,699
I'm getting out of the car. Spawn police?

372
01:16:52,699 --> 01:16:56,149
Hold on.

373
01:16:56,149 --> 01:17:08,760
Spawn police?

374
01:17:08,760 --> 01:17:12,579
No, get that off. Okay.

375
01:17:12,579 --> 01:17:18,069
How do I do it? Unstop.

376
01:17:18,069 --> 01:17:21,130
Fire, brake, extinguish,

377
01:17:21,130 --> 01:17:25,029
hinges. Where is it?

378
01:17:25,029 --> 01:17:29,369
Oh, AI. Random AI.

379
01:17:29,369 --> 01:17:32,439
Chase me. The AI is going to

380
01:17:32,439 --> 01:17:37,050
chase you? What? Who are?

381
01:17:37,050 --> 01:18:18,819
Oh my god!

382
01:18:30,539 --> 01:18:32,539
Each one of these people has been paid

383
01:18:32,539 --> 01:18:34,539
$15,000 to crash

384
01:18:34,539 --> 01:18:36,539
into your identity.

385
01:18:36,539 --> 01:18:38,539
Your identity.

386
01:18:38,539 --> 01:18:40,539
It's your job. Your choice.

387
01:18:40,539 --> 01:18:42,539
See how long you can live.

388
01:18:42,539 --> 01:18:44,539
All of these people that have been paid $20,000

389
01:18:44,539 --> 01:18:46,539
to crash into your identity.

390
01:18:46,539 --> 01:18:48,539
Hold on. Hold on.

391
01:18:48,539 --> 01:18:50,539
Everybody freeze.

392
01:18:50,539 --> 01:18:52,539
Freeze. Freeze.

393
01:18:52,539 --> 01:18:56,250
Freeze. Different idea.

394
01:18:56,250 --> 01:19:00,789
Freeze. Freeze. Everybody freeze.

395
01:19:00,789 --> 01:19:08,600
Hold on. Hold on. You found yourself

396
01:19:08,600 --> 01:19:10,600
standing in this car, wondering why

397
01:19:10,600 --> 01:19:13,739
you're here while you woke up here.

398
01:19:13,739 --> 01:19:15,739
Understanding that you have access to the gas.

399
01:19:15,739 --> 01:19:18,100
Gas. Gas.

400
01:19:18,100 --> 01:19:23,159
Gas. Gas. Gas. Gas.

401
01:19:23,159 --> 01:19:25,159
Driving this car is at your utmost

402
01:19:25,159 --> 01:19:27,159
intended purpose.

403
01:19:27,159 --> 01:19:29,460
Because every single car on this road,

404
01:19:29,460 --> 01:19:31,460
David, is AI.

405
01:19:31,460 --> 01:19:33,829
AI controlled cars

406
01:19:33,829 --> 01:19:35,829
will have been programmed to kill you.

407
01:19:35,829 --> 01:19:38,899
They will stop at nothing before

408
01:19:38,899 --> 01:19:40,899
you are a corpse.

409
01:19:40,899 --> 01:19:43,079
You ought to make your choice and

410
01:19:43,079 --> 01:19:45,079
drive around and get away from these

411
01:19:45,079 --> 01:19:47,079
AI gas

412
01:19:47,079 --> 01:19:51,109
controlled cars.

413
01:19:51,109 --> 01:19:53,289
Good luck. You're going to need it.

414
01:19:53,289 --> 01:19:57,130
As you see, my thing, this is

415
01:19:57,130 --> 01:19:59,130
technology is getting a little too crazy.

416
01:19:59,130 --> 01:20:01,130
You were the one that programmed

417
01:20:01,130 --> 01:20:03,130
these cars, aren't you David?

418
01:20:03,130 --> 01:20:05,130
You were the one that programmed these cars.

419
01:20:05,130 --> 01:20:07,130
You are

420
01:20:07,130 --> 01:20:11,479
completely stuck.

421
01:20:11,479 --> 01:20:13,479
Technology can't solve every problem,

422
01:20:13,479 --> 01:20:15,479
David. As I'm sure you're realizing right now.

423
01:20:15,479 --> 01:20:26,170
Alright, no more Saw.

424
01:20:26,170 --> 01:20:39,350
I'm done with Saw.

425
01:20:39,350 --> 01:20:41,350
You were the programmer of these.

426
01:20:41,350 --> 01:20:43,350
You were the CEO of the programming, weren't you David?

427
01:20:43,350 --> 01:20:53,579
Alright, I want to...

428
01:20:53,579 --> 01:20:55,939
He's actually backing up.

429
01:20:55,939 --> 01:21:06,739
What happened?

430
01:21:06,739 --> 01:21:12,420
Instability detected?

431
01:21:12,420 --> 01:21:15,430
What do you mean instability?

432
01:21:15,430 --> 01:21:28,920
Where? On the bus?

433
01:21:28,920 --> 01:21:39,720
What the fuck?

434
01:21:39,720 --> 01:21:50,390
What is this?

435
01:21:50,390 --> 01:21:57,689
Why is this attached to the car?

436
01:21:57,689 --> 01:22:06,460
It's your tire?

437
01:22:06,460 --> 01:22:10,170
What's going on? What is it attached to?

438
01:22:10,170 --> 01:22:17,779
I don't get it. It's on the moon.

439
01:22:17,779 --> 01:22:36,840
How do I get rid of it? How do I take that off?

440
01:22:36,840 --> 01:22:39,270
Alright, I'm going to a new map.

441
01:22:39,270 --> 01:22:50,600
Pause, pause, pause. What is this person doing?

442
01:22:50,600 --> 01:23:03,460
How do I go faster? What are they doing?

443
01:23:03,460 --> 01:23:09,670
Why are people just driving into stuff?

444
01:23:09,670 --> 01:23:15,939
Alright, we're going to grid map.

445
01:23:15,939 --> 01:23:19,909
I'm changing map.

446
01:23:19,909 --> 01:23:27,079
Grid map, people are saying.

447
01:23:27,079 --> 01:23:29,079
Compete in the west coast drag race?

448
01:23:29,079 --> 01:23:32,899
I want to do this. Oh no, I don't. It's the same map.

449
01:23:32,899 --> 01:23:41,079
Main menu? Okay, where do you want to go?

450
01:23:41,079 --> 01:23:45,430
Grid? Grid.

451
01:23:45,430 --> 01:23:49,340
Grid map V2.

452
01:23:49,340 --> 01:23:52,539
Leave me the fuck alone.

453
01:23:52,539 --> 01:23:54,539
Is this the default?

454
01:23:54,539 --> 01:23:58,500
Oh my god, what's happening?

455
01:23:58,500 --> 01:24:00,500
Oh, that's right. They're on missions to kill me.

456
01:24:00,500 --> 01:24:17,899
I'm going to go default.

457
01:24:21,899 --> 01:24:28,229
Is this where the giant enemy spider is?

458
01:24:28,229 --> 01:24:32,579
That's a different game. This is interesting though.

459
01:24:32,579 --> 01:24:40,380
I want a different car.

460
01:24:40,380 --> 01:24:43,960
I want...oh, is this the environment stuff?

461
01:24:43,960 --> 01:24:48,170
What should I drive? Probably something cool, right?

462
01:24:48,170 --> 01:24:59,800
You can drive the cannon.

463
01:24:59,800 --> 01:25:05,350
Drive the pigeon. Okay.

464
01:25:05,350 --> 01:25:12,779
How about the pigeon plus?

465
01:25:12,779 --> 01:25:15,779
So this is a little obstacle course.

466
01:25:15,779 --> 01:25:30,810
This looks like a Disney car.

467
01:25:30,810 --> 01:25:35,420
Whoa, that's cool. That was awesome.

468
01:25:35,420 --> 01:25:39,180
Alright, I'm going to do it again.

469
01:25:39,180 --> 01:25:41,180
This car has three wheels. What is this for?

470
01:25:41,180 --> 01:25:49,989
It's a three wheeled one.

471
01:25:49,989 --> 01:25:54,579
Whoa, hold on.

472
01:25:54,579 --> 01:26:06,300
Can I squish through that? Is it insert to repair?

473
01:26:06,300 --> 01:26:11,930
Let's find out.

474
01:26:11,930 --> 01:26:15,060
I like this little course. Insert.

475
01:26:15,060 --> 01:26:21,130
Thanks for that tip.

476
01:26:21,130 --> 01:26:25,029
Alright, where am I going to go? I want to go...

477
01:26:25,029 --> 01:26:27,029
Let me set my home here so I don't keep spawning in a place I don't want to spawn.

478
01:26:27,029 --> 01:26:29,029
What? AI?

479
01:26:29,029 --> 01:26:31,029
I don't want traffic here, do I?

480
01:26:31,029 --> 01:26:35,640
What's powertrain?

481
01:26:35,640 --> 01:26:39,659
Manage. Set home.

482
01:26:39,659 --> 01:26:43,819
You picked the wrong pigeon.

483
01:26:43,819 --> 01:26:45,819
Alright, I'll pick the...whatever. Let's go.

484
01:26:45,819 --> 01:26:49,079
You want me to pick a different pigeon?

485
01:26:49,079 --> 01:26:57,260
You want this one. This one here.

486
01:26:57,260 --> 01:26:59,260
What kind of car is this?

487
01:26:59,260 --> 01:27:02,180
Alright, this thing is not supposed to be driven.

488
01:27:02,180 --> 01:27:09,220
You don't drive this car.

489
01:27:09,220 --> 01:27:11,220
This car is meant to just...

490
01:27:11,220 --> 01:27:17,750
Is this a real car?

491
01:27:17,750 --> 01:27:21,590
Are you serious? Look what I just did.

492
01:27:21,590 --> 01:27:25,619
It's training wheels.

493
01:27:25,619 --> 01:27:28,439
I feel like I want to be driving the other direction.

494
01:27:28,439 --> 01:27:32,279
Alright, I want to take two cars

495
01:27:32,279 --> 01:27:34,279
and have them drive as fast as they can and smash into each other.

496
01:27:34,279 --> 01:27:36,649
I can do that, right?

497
01:27:36,649 --> 01:27:38,649
I'm going to start at the one end of the track

498
01:27:38,649 --> 01:27:40,649
and I'm going to go a thousand miles per hour

499
01:27:40,649 --> 01:27:42,649
and then I'm going to crash into each other.

500
01:27:42,649 --> 01:27:55,819
That's what I want to do.

501
01:27:55,819 --> 01:27:58,180
Oh, man. Ow.

502
01:27:58,180 --> 01:28:00,180
Okay. Manage.

503
01:28:00,180 --> 01:28:02,180
Select. I want a very fast car.

504
01:28:02,180 --> 01:28:07,109
I'll vote one of these.

505
01:28:07,109 --> 01:28:10,359
Yeah. This one.

506
01:28:10,359 --> 01:28:13,750
And do slow-mo, slow-mo, slow-mo.

507
01:28:13,750 --> 01:28:17,210
I'll do slow-mo.

508
01:28:17,210 --> 01:28:20,600
Okay, we're going to get you here.

509
01:28:20,600 --> 01:28:22,600
So I need to spawn another car.

510
01:28:22,600 --> 01:28:27,210
Where's that one? That one's here.

511
01:28:27,210 --> 01:28:30,020
That's fine. So now over this way, I want to spawn another car.

512
01:28:30,020 --> 01:28:32,329
Very far away.

513
01:28:32,329 --> 01:28:37,960
Like all the way over here.

514
01:28:37,960 --> 01:28:43,079
I can spawn a car right here, can't I?

515
01:28:43,079 --> 01:28:51,270
Same deal. I just want to see what happens.

516
01:28:51,270 --> 01:28:54,779
So, spawn new.

517
01:28:54,779 --> 01:28:56,949
Okay. So now,

518
01:28:56,949 --> 01:29:02,569
use the grid?

519
01:29:02,569 --> 01:29:04,569
What on the rocket? Use the grid.

520
01:29:04,569 --> 01:29:06,569
What do you mean use the grid?

521
01:29:06,569 --> 01:29:31,399
Oh, I went the wrong way.

522
01:29:31,399 --> 01:29:39,579
No, no, no. Come back, come back, come back.

523
01:29:39,579 --> 01:29:41,579
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

524
01:29:41,579 --> 01:29:43,579
What the fuck? Whatever.

525
01:29:43,579 --> 01:29:45,579
I went the wrong way. It's hard.

526
01:29:45,579 --> 01:29:51,720
Just get over here. Both of you.

527
01:29:51,720 --> 01:29:57,479
Stay right there. Use the grid.

528
01:29:57,479 --> 01:30:04,779
Use the grid on the ground. I don't get it.

529
01:30:04,779 --> 01:30:09,579
Use them to line up on the grid.

530
01:30:09,579 --> 01:30:11,579
Oh, I thought you meant it was like a thing,

531
01:30:11,579 --> 01:30:13,579
like a menu thing I had to do and go into the grid.

532
01:30:13,579 --> 01:30:15,579
Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

533
01:30:15,579 --> 01:30:33,420
Nice. Okay.

534
01:30:33,420 --> 01:30:38,470
We're going to line up here.

535
01:30:38,470 --> 01:30:40,470
Right in the middle here. That looks good.

536
01:30:40,470 --> 01:30:44,310
Switch to the yellow one. Where the hell are you?

537
01:30:44,310 --> 01:30:54,859
Where are you? Where's the other car? Where's the other car?

538
01:30:54,859 --> 01:31:05,210
Where's the other car? Use the AI

539
01:31:05,210 --> 01:31:07,210
chase? No, I want to smash them into each other.

540
01:31:07,210 --> 01:31:17,640
Where's the other car? Where the fuck is the other car?

541
01:31:17,640 --> 01:31:25,319
Okay, there you are.

542
01:31:25,319 --> 01:31:27,689
Alright, alright, alright, alright. So you need to line up.

543
01:31:27,689 --> 01:31:35,109
You're fine, but you need to come over here.

544
01:31:35,109 --> 01:31:38,890
Use the chase and go head on. Wait.

545
01:31:38,890 --> 01:31:44,390
Okay. Let me try that.

546
01:31:44,390 --> 01:31:58,899
That will work. What menu is it in?

547
01:31:58,899 --> 01:32:01,399
AI, okay. AI, chase me.

548
01:32:01,399 --> 01:32:33,239
Alright, where are you?

549
01:32:33,239 --> 01:32:44,699
AI. He crashed.

550
01:32:44,699 --> 01:33:18,340
Is he crashed? Stop avoiding

551
01:33:18,340 --> 01:33:20,340
me. What the fuck? What

552
01:33:20,340 --> 01:33:24,439
the... Stop avoiding...

553
01:33:24,439 --> 01:33:32,250
He avoided me.

554
01:33:32,250 --> 01:33:41,020
You just...

555
01:33:47,020 --> 01:33:58,199
Stop. Stop it.

556
01:33:58,199 --> 01:34:05,159
Stop. Get off of me. Get away from

557
01:34:05,159 --> 01:34:24,859
me. Get off of me.

558
01:34:24,859 --> 01:34:32,090
He's...

559
01:34:32,090 --> 01:34:35,479
Fuck. I have an idea.

560
01:34:35,479 --> 01:34:37,479
Okay, I want to run away from like 20

561
01:34:37,479 --> 01:34:41,180
Mack trucks. Can I... Wait.

562
01:34:41,180 --> 01:34:43,180
Can I just have like 10 Mack trucks just drive

563
01:34:43,180 --> 01:34:52,710
straight into each other? That sounds kind of cool.

564
01:34:52,710 --> 01:34:55,850
Alright, one more of these and I'm done.

565
01:34:55,850 --> 01:35:07,239
What's wrong with you? Why are you not chasing anymore?

566
01:35:07,239 --> 01:35:11,079
Come on. I'm leaving this guy in the dust.

567
01:35:11,079 --> 01:35:21,500
Where is he? Oh my god.

568
01:35:21,500 --> 01:36:03,720
Did you repair the other car? I think so.

569
01:36:03,720 --> 01:36:24,390
Is this a wall? Is he alright?

570
01:36:24,390 --> 01:36:27,140
The guy gets out of the car and he like

571
01:36:27,140 --> 01:36:29,960
with the red bull. He did it!

572
01:36:29,960 --> 01:36:31,960
Oh my god, he actually did it! He made it!

573
01:36:31,960 --> 01:36:34,140
He made... He did the jump!

574
01:36:34,140 --> 01:36:44,420
Where's the other car? Oh no.

575
01:36:44,420 --> 01:37:02,840
Alright, how do I delete cars?

576
01:37:02,840 --> 01:37:14,789
Is he coming for me? This is going to be scary.

577
01:37:14,789 --> 01:37:32,779
Wait, there he is.

578
01:37:32,779 --> 01:37:34,779
Jeez. What's up, man?

579
01:37:34,779 --> 01:37:39,880
Alright, let me... Okay.

580
01:37:39,880 --> 01:37:42,119
Alright, alright. Let me do this here. I want to

581
01:37:42,119 --> 01:37:44,359
do... I want to delete everybody. Delete

582
01:37:44,359 --> 01:37:46,859
everybody. Delete car. How do you delete car?

583
01:37:46,859 --> 01:37:54,659
Manage. Remove, right?

584
01:37:54,659 --> 01:38:01,350
Okay, remove. And then remove.

585
01:38:01,350 --> 01:38:03,350
Okay, I want a bunch of trucks.

586
01:38:03,350 --> 01:38:11,270
Okay, so. Manage.

587
01:38:11,270 --> 01:38:16,010
Okay, what's something crazy? Okay, buses?

588
01:38:16,010 --> 01:38:22,069
The Ram bus? The hero?

589
01:38:22,069 --> 01:38:24,760
Which one of these should I do? The hero bus?

590
01:38:24,760 --> 01:38:28,470
Okay, can I spawn this

591
01:38:28,470 --> 01:38:31,159
a bunch of times? Or do I have to do the menu

592
01:38:31,159 --> 01:38:43,319
every time? Just do clone? Okay, cool.

593
01:38:43,319 --> 01:38:46,069
Alright, so now I want to do clone.

594
01:38:46,069 --> 01:38:56,220
Clone. Clone. Is it going to

595
01:38:56,220 --> 01:39:03,260
break my computer? Is it going to be bad for the computer?

596
01:39:03,260 --> 01:39:16,180
Hope so. Yeah, I hope

597
01:39:16,180 --> 01:39:19,699
so. Alright, what do you think? 20?

598
01:39:19,699 --> 01:39:22,199
One, two, three, four, five, six,

599
01:39:22,199 --> 01:39:24,199
seven, eight, nine. Let's do like 20.

600
01:39:24,199 --> 01:39:30,729
And we're going to have them all on chase mode.

601
01:39:30,729 --> 01:39:39,930
Is that a bad idea? Oh, well

602
01:39:39,930 --> 01:39:50,659
here's 10. I'll try 10. Okay.

603
01:39:50,659 --> 01:39:57,369
Uh, select.

604
01:39:57,369 --> 01:40:00,890
Looks like a little dinky car. Don't do

605
01:40:00,890 --> 01:40:06,899
20. My CPU's going to explode. Fridge?

606
01:40:06,899 --> 01:40:16,100
Huh? Can I move

607
01:40:16,100 --> 01:40:21,930
as the fridge? I can't, okay,

608
01:40:21,930 --> 01:40:27,689
I can't move as the fridge. Whatever. Okay,

609
01:40:27,689 --> 01:40:35,430
select. How about um, pause

610
01:40:35,430 --> 01:40:39,720
before you start? It's the best vehicle?

611
01:40:39,720 --> 01:40:42,840
Get in the ball. Um,

612
01:40:42,840 --> 01:40:46,619
for now, I want to, I'm going to just get into one of these.

613
01:40:46,619 --> 01:40:51,779
Get in the tanker. Should I

614
01:40:51,779 --> 01:40:53,779
do a Christmas tree? No, alright, I'll do the ball.

615
01:40:53,779 --> 01:41:01,960
Can I move? I can't really move.

616
01:41:01,960 --> 01:41:08,340
Doesn't really work the way you think it is. I'm just going to

617
01:41:08,340 --> 01:41:19,779
get in a car. Okay, here we go. So these are all,

618
01:41:19,779 --> 01:41:47,180
I'm going to set these all to kill. It's kind of lagging.

619
01:41:47,180 --> 01:41:51,000
Okay, chase me.

620
01:41:51,000 --> 01:42:06,920
Chase me. Why are they one

621
01:42:06,920 --> 01:42:08,920
singular bus?

622
01:42:08,920 --> 01:42:11,159
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

623
01:42:11,159 --> 01:42:14,039
Why are they one bus?

624
01:42:14,039 --> 01:42:30,659
What the fuck?

625
01:42:30,659 --> 01:42:32,659
Oh, oh! What do I do?

626
01:42:32,659 --> 01:42:44,939
Reset.

627
01:42:44,939 --> 01:42:51,270
That was a tactical movement.

628
01:42:51,270 --> 01:42:53,270
Fuck this stupid goddamn sports car.

629
01:42:55,270 --> 01:42:57,270
You went a little too fast. Oh my god.

630
01:42:57,270 --> 01:42:59,270
Raise it ten, raise it ten feet off the ground.

631
01:42:59,270 --> 01:43:01,270
Make the tires bigger. Give me

632
01:43:01,270 --> 01:43:04,659
another car. These things suck.

633
01:43:04,659 --> 01:43:06,659
Gigantic fucking toy.

634
01:43:06,659 --> 01:43:08,659
I want something I can drive, like this.

635
01:43:08,659 --> 01:43:13,449
Yeah! That's much better.

636
01:43:13,449 --> 01:43:22,340
This is a man sized car.

637
01:43:22,340 --> 01:43:27,020
Alright, so this is all fucked up.

638
01:43:27,020 --> 01:43:29,319
I don't think this is going to happen anymore.

639
01:43:29,319 --> 01:43:35,079
Do I just like, alright, there is a

640
01:43:35,079 --> 01:43:37,079
bump stuck in this car.

641
01:43:37,079 --> 01:43:44,489
Which one of these should, I want to drive

642
01:43:44,489 --> 01:43:49,670
one of the other cars.

643
01:43:49,670 --> 01:43:52,229
Tab. Tab. How do I switch cars?

644
01:43:52,229 --> 01:43:54,229
Shift R.

645
01:43:54,229 --> 01:43:58,260
R.

646
01:43:58,260 --> 01:44:01,340
This is actually fucked up.

647
01:44:01,340 --> 01:44:08,739
Hit insert.

648
01:44:08,739 --> 01:44:10,739
Alright, this is the one causing the problem.

649
01:44:10,739 --> 01:44:17,079
I gotta back this one up. I feel like I'm playing

650
01:44:17,079 --> 01:44:19,079
one of those iPad games where I have to go

651
01:44:19,079 --> 01:44:21,079
slide down, slide left, slide left,

652
01:44:21,079 --> 01:44:23,079
right, right, slide down, slide down.

653
01:44:23,079 --> 01:44:50,649
Okay.

654
01:44:50,649 --> 01:44:52,649
Oh my god! Why are they all so connected

655
01:44:52,649 --> 01:44:55,529
to each other?

656
01:44:55,529 --> 01:44:57,529
It's like a campaign trail.

657
01:44:57,529 --> 01:45:09,689
Where are we going?

658
01:45:09,689 --> 01:45:13,460
I don't know where to go.

659
01:45:13,460 --> 01:45:20,550
There's too many.

660
01:45:20,550 --> 01:45:23,109
Their weakness is turning.

661
01:45:23,109 --> 01:45:35,399
Holy shit, they're going fast.

662
01:45:35,399 --> 01:45:37,399
Nobody gives a senator the finger out the window.

663
01:45:37,399 --> 01:45:44,500
Get him!

664
01:45:44,500 --> 01:45:46,500
Some of them are going to lose, some of them I think.

665
01:45:46,500 --> 01:45:49,640
No, he's still there.

666
01:45:49,640 --> 01:45:53,859
Uh oh.

667
01:45:53,859 --> 01:45:55,859
The brakes.

668
01:45:55,859 --> 01:45:58,229
Oh shit.

669
01:45:58,229 --> 01:46:01,619
Oh my god!

670
01:46:01,619 --> 01:46:07,239
I'm still...

671
01:46:07,239 --> 01:46:24,569
Uh oh.

672
01:46:24,569 --> 01:46:26,569
I want to take this to

673
01:46:26,569 --> 01:46:28,569
somewhere else, right?

674
01:46:28,569 --> 01:46:32,220
Yeah, I want to go somewhere else.

675
01:46:32,220 --> 01:46:37,659
I want to go to one of the other places.

676
01:46:37,659 --> 01:46:41,369
Let's go back to the main.

677
01:46:41,369 --> 01:46:45,590
Bus routes? Italy?

678
01:46:45,590 --> 01:46:47,899
Where else should I go?

679
01:46:47,899 --> 01:46:50,579
The Derby Arena?

680
01:46:50,579 --> 01:46:54,939
Oh, the Derby Arena.

681
01:46:54,939 --> 01:47:01,340
Go to scenarios. Collect mountain.

682
01:47:01,340 --> 01:47:03,340
Garage to garage delivery. Port escape.

683
01:47:03,340 --> 01:47:05,340
King size.

684
01:47:05,340 --> 01:47:07,640
Goliath. Alright, what's Goliath?

685
01:47:07,640 --> 01:47:09,640
A semi truck is causing havoc on the highway.

686
01:47:09,640 --> 01:47:11,640
We must stop it at all costs.

687
01:47:11,640 --> 01:47:13,640
That won't be easy, but you don't have to worry about damaging your vehicle.

688
01:47:13,640 --> 01:47:23,819
Alright?

689
01:47:23,819 --> 01:47:28,100
Where's the music? Is there music?

690
01:47:28,100 --> 01:47:34,170
Is it on?

691
01:47:34,170 --> 01:47:43,380
This one is really hard.

692
01:47:43,380 --> 01:47:46,250
The semi truck is causing havoc on the highway.

693
01:47:46,250 --> 01:47:48,250
We must stop it at all costs.

694
01:47:48,250 --> 01:47:51,189
Won't be easy, but you don't have to worry.

695
01:47:51,189 --> 01:47:57,399
So stop the truck. Where is it?

696
01:47:57,399 --> 01:48:03,220
Causing havoc on the highway.

697
01:48:03,220 --> 01:48:05,659
Put on brake core for this.

698
01:48:05,659 --> 01:48:23,109
Okay, you ready?

699
01:48:23,109 --> 01:48:30,520
You ready?

700
01:48:30,520 --> 01:48:32,520
It's, uh, okay, this one. Let's go!

701
01:48:32,520 --> 01:48:48,140
Restart. Restart the mission.

702
01:48:48,140 --> 01:48:50,140
Restart the mission.

703
01:48:50,140 --> 01:48:52,140
This is fucking with my head.

704
01:48:52,140 --> 01:48:54,140
This is fucking with my head. Imagine if the police were listening to this.

705
01:48:54,140 --> 01:48:57,590
Yeah, John, let's go!

706
01:48:57,590 --> 01:48:59,590
Turn it up!

707
01:48:59,590 --> 01:49:10,409
We gotta chase!

708
01:49:10,409 --> 01:49:27,180
Oh my fucking god, that's fine.

709
01:49:27,180 --> 01:49:29,180
I can't fucking do it.

710
01:49:29,180 --> 01:49:31,180
Just drive the car. I can't.

711
01:49:31,180 --> 01:49:33,180
I'm trying.

712
01:49:33,180 --> 01:49:35,180
I tried!

713
01:49:35,180 --> 01:49:38,310
Alright, where is this motherfucker?

714
01:49:38,310 --> 01:49:40,680
Get him!

715
01:49:40,680 --> 01:49:44,649
Dude, it sounds like the person in the passenger seat

716
01:49:44,649 --> 01:49:46,649
is just going like this to the

717
01:49:46,649 --> 01:49:48,649
tuner. It's like, dude,

718
01:49:48,649 --> 01:49:50,649
pick a station! We're trying to

719
01:49:50,649 --> 01:49:55,960
catch this guy!

720
01:49:55,960 --> 01:50:04,340
There he is! I can't see!

721
01:50:04,340 --> 01:50:08,890
Where is he?

722
01:50:08,890 --> 01:50:14,579
Okay, alright.

723
01:50:14,579 --> 01:50:16,579
Alright, alright, alright. Give me a second.

724
01:50:16,579 --> 01:50:18,579
Give me a second. Give me a second.

725
01:50:18,579 --> 01:50:20,579
Regular camera. Let me try regular.

726
01:50:20,579 --> 01:50:38,739
Regular camera.

727
01:50:38,739 --> 01:50:44,380
Alright, there he is right there.

728
01:50:44,380 --> 01:50:50,970
What the fuck? I want the siren!

729
01:50:50,970 --> 01:51:08,380
How do I turn the siren on?

730
01:51:08,380 --> 01:51:24,500
I'm sorry.

731
01:51:24,500 --> 01:51:26,500
I'm trying to wait on stuff.

732
01:51:26,500 --> 01:51:29,640
Just get in the road!

733
01:51:29,640 --> 01:51:53,619
Hold on.

734
01:51:53,619 --> 01:51:58,739
I can't.

735
01:51:58,739 --> 01:52:04,420
I can't.

736
01:52:04,420 --> 01:52:06,420
It's too fucked up!

737
01:52:06,420 --> 01:52:10,010
It's too fucked up. I'm sorry.

738
01:52:10,010 --> 01:52:12,010
I can't help it. I have to do something fucking stupid.

739
01:52:12,010 --> 01:52:14,180
Just restart.

740
01:52:14,180 --> 01:52:16,180
Alright, I promise I'm not going to turn on

741
01:52:16,180 --> 01:52:18,180
the brake core.

742
01:52:18,180 --> 01:52:22,779
It's funny.

743
01:52:22,779 --> 01:52:24,779
You can keep the music, but keep the

744
01:52:24,779 --> 01:52:33,539
regular camera. Okay, fine.

745
01:52:33,539 --> 01:52:35,539
How about this camera? This one's good.

746
01:52:35,539 --> 01:52:40,340
Arnold?

747
01:52:40,340 --> 01:52:59,670
Hey! Pull over!

748
01:52:59,670 --> 01:53:01,850
Pull over!

749
01:53:01,850 --> 01:53:05,619
Did you just hear this out of the officer's car?

750
01:53:19,260 --> 01:53:23,210
Stop!

751
01:53:23,210 --> 01:53:25,210
Stop driving! Stop moving!

752
01:53:25,210 --> 01:53:31,800
Stop!

753
01:53:31,800 --> 01:53:33,800
Oh my god, you piece of shit!

754
01:53:33,800 --> 01:53:36,170
Just crash!

755
01:53:36,170 --> 01:53:57,800
No, not me!

756
01:53:57,800 --> 01:53:59,800
God damn it!

757
01:53:59,800 --> 01:54:01,800
Fuck!

758
01:54:01,800 --> 01:54:12,359
I'm doing it again.

759
01:54:12,359 --> 01:54:17,159
No, I have a better idea.

760
01:54:17,159 --> 01:54:22,220
I'm not doing fucking crazy music.

761
01:54:22,220 --> 01:55:35,220
I'm catching this guy.

762
01:55:35,220 --> 01:55:37,220
Right into it!

763
01:55:37,220 --> 01:55:46,060
Stop driving!

764
01:55:46,060 --> 01:56:28,340
Is he going to run out of gas?

765
01:56:28,340 --> 01:56:35,829
What was that?

766
01:56:35,829 --> 01:56:41,020
Why is he speeding up?

767
01:56:41,020 --> 01:56:44,859
Why is he speeding up? I can't see.

768
01:56:44,859 --> 01:56:49,590
No, he's not speeding up.

769
01:56:49,590 --> 01:56:52,340
I don't understand what I'm supposed to do about this.

770
01:56:52,340 --> 01:57:01,239
I actually don't understand what to do.

771
01:57:01,239 --> 01:57:07,640
You piece of shit!

772
01:57:07,640 --> 01:57:17,109
I've got to get him to drive into one of those poles.

773
01:57:17,109 --> 01:57:19,930
There it is!

774
01:57:19,930 --> 01:57:23,640
Three, two, one.

775
01:57:23,640 --> 01:57:25,640
Got it.

776
01:57:25,640 --> 01:57:30,039
Bang. Got it.

777
01:57:30,039 --> 01:57:33,989
Hell yeah. Nice.

778
01:57:33,989 --> 01:57:40,630
Alright, what else should I do? That was cool.

779
01:57:40,630 --> 01:57:42,630
Uh...

780
01:57:42,630 --> 01:57:45,770
Barrel? Barrel knocker?

781
01:57:45,770 --> 01:57:51,399
Yeah, let's do barrel knocker.

782
01:57:51,399 --> 01:57:55,239
This game's cool. This game's actually really cool.

783
01:57:55,239 --> 01:58:02,220
Do port escape. I'll do port escape after this.

784
01:58:02,220 --> 01:58:08,739
He loves it. I think it's pretty good.

785
01:58:08,739 --> 01:58:11,819
Just fun kind of sandbox.

786
01:58:11,819 --> 01:58:15,810
Alright, I've done put some barrels around the dirt road.

787
01:58:15,810 --> 01:58:19,050
This darn truck can't carry a tune in a bucket.

788
01:58:19,050 --> 01:58:24,050
So pull up your britches and get fixin' to knock them all barrel down.

789
01:58:24,050 --> 01:58:26,050
I reckon you got a minute or so.

790
01:58:26,050 --> 01:58:30,050
Why you don't get all tore up? Them nasty barrels is hidin' in the swamp.

791
01:58:30,050 --> 01:58:33,050
And them gosh darn bushes. I'm not gonna get the role.

792
01:58:33,050 --> 01:58:37,420
I'm not gonna. I'm reading sides right now for this character and I'm not gonna get it.

793
01:58:37,420 --> 01:58:42,460
Um, okay.

794
01:58:42,460 --> 01:58:44,460
Uh, like country music?

795
01:58:44,460 --> 01:58:50,520
Gotta have music in the background.

796
01:58:50,520 --> 01:58:53,520
Like banjo music. Like banjo royalty free.

797
01:58:53,520 --> 01:59:04,579
This is good. I think this works.

798
01:59:04,579 --> 01:59:15,890
Knock over the barrels.

799
01:59:15,890 --> 01:59:17,890
This is loud as fuck. Hold on.

800
01:59:17,890 --> 01:59:32,850
There's no music.

801
01:59:32,850 --> 01:59:34,850
Let's go. I missed it already.

802
01:59:34,850 --> 01:59:39,899
Alright, let's go. Go, go, go, go, go, go.

803
01:59:39,899 --> 01:59:44,960
Music's too quiet? There you go.

804
01:59:44,960 --> 01:59:49,100
Music's up. Alright, restart.

805
01:59:49,100 --> 02:00:05,869
Ready? One, two, three, go.

806
02:00:05,869 --> 02:00:09,369
This is hard. This is way too hard.

807
02:00:09,369 --> 02:00:12,310
This one's like fuckin' hard. Way hard.

808
02:00:12,310 --> 02:00:14,310
This one's too hard. This one's way too hard.

809
02:00:14,310 --> 02:00:16,310
Give us a good yee-haw.

810
02:00:21,609 --> 02:00:23,609
How do you do yee-haw? It's like...

811
02:00:23,609 --> 02:00:25,609
No, how do you do a yee-haw?

812
02:00:25,609 --> 02:00:27,609
It's like...

813
02:00:27,609 --> 02:00:31,000
You need to put this on times two speed.

814
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:33,239
You guys need to just...

815
02:00:33,239 --> 02:00:48,020
Relax.

816
02:00:48,020 --> 02:00:50,020
You guys just want breakcore.

817
02:00:50,020 --> 02:00:52,020
You guys can't pay attention unless it's like...

818
02:00:52,020 --> 02:00:54,020
Like...

819
02:00:54,020 --> 02:00:56,020
No!

820
02:00:56,020 --> 02:00:58,020
This is bad for your brain.

821
02:00:58,020 --> 02:01:00,020
This is bad for your brain.

822
02:01:00,020 --> 02:01:02,020
It's not good for your brain. You need to slow down.

823
02:01:02,020 --> 02:01:04,020
You need to read a book. You need to fucking breathe oxygen.

824
02:01:04,020 --> 02:01:06,020
Like, lie down. Lie in bed.

825
02:01:06,020 --> 02:01:08,020
Don't listen to this.

826
02:01:08,020 --> 02:01:10,020
It's small doses.

827
02:01:10,020 --> 02:01:12,020
This is gonna hurt your brain cells. They're gonna fry.

828
02:01:12,020 --> 02:01:19,689
It's over.

829
02:01:19,689 --> 02:01:26,140
Now I miss it. Don't you?

830
02:01:26,140 --> 02:01:28,140
I don't know. No, no, no.

831
02:01:28,140 --> 02:01:30,140
I decide what to add to get on the stream.

832
02:01:30,140 --> 02:01:35,770
I can't do this.

833
02:01:35,770 --> 02:01:38,329
Please do breakcore.

834
02:01:38,329 --> 02:01:43,829
I'm begging you to.

835
02:01:43,829 --> 02:02:10,569
Alright, hold on. Slow down.

836
02:02:10,569 --> 02:02:13,579
Yee-haw!

837
02:02:13,579 --> 02:02:17,159
I was very unsure of that.

838
02:02:17,159 --> 02:02:20,300
I was incredibly unsure of that.

839
02:02:20,300 --> 02:02:24,899
Was it weak?

840
02:02:24,899 --> 02:02:30,659
I was really unsure.

841
02:02:30,659 --> 02:02:32,659
Yeah, all you guys need in the background here is...

842
02:02:32,659 --> 02:02:35,100
I'm Detective Chocobo.

843
02:02:46,489 --> 02:02:48,489
I'm telling ya. One, two, three.

844
02:02:48,489 --> 02:02:56,739
Just play music and movie clips.

845
02:02:56,739 --> 02:02:58,739
Alright, I'm not doing this one.

846
02:02:58,739 --> 02:03:10,970
I'll try it one more time.

847
02:03:10,970 --> 02:03:17,619
No, fuck that.

848
02:03:17,619 --> 02:03:21,079
Let me try this for real.

849
02:03:21,079 --> 02:03:25,369
Play the cars theme?

850
02:03:25,369 --> 02:03:27,670
Do breakcore, slow down.

851
02:03:27,670 --> 02:03:29,670
I wonder what that would sound like.

852
02:03:29,670 --> 02:03:31,670
Don't get me wrong. I think that was cool.

853
02:03:31,670 --> 02:03:33,670
Breakcore is outrageous.

854
02:03:33,670 --> 02:03:35,670
Enough for me to be like, I'm paying attention.

855
02:03:35,670 --> 02:03:37,909
This is interesting.

856
02:03:37,909 --> 02:03:39,909
I don't know why I want to play that.

857
02:03:39,909 --> 02:03:41,909
Unless I'm really looking for it.

858
02:03:41,909 --> 02:03:44,859
It's cool.

859
02:03:44,859 --> 02:03:46,859
I mean, that's really cool.

860
02:03:46,859 --> 02:03:49,670
You missed one.

861
02:03:49,670 --> 02:03:51,670
You corrected me on my own stream.

862
02:03:51,670 --> 02:03:54,100
I'm alright.

863
02:03:54,100 --> 02:03:57,750
Did you correct me?

864
02:03:57,750 --> 02:04:00,569
What is this?

865
02:04:00,569 --> 02:04:02,569
What does it hold on?

866
02:04:02,569 --> 02:04:09,909
Cocoa for Cocoa Pops.

867
02:04:09,909 --> 02:04:15,979
They're great.

868
02:04:20,600 --> 02:04:23,989
Where did it go?

869
02:04:23,989 --> 02:04:25,989
I'd buy that for a dollar.

870
02:04:25,989 --> 02:04:28,939
That's a sufferin' sucka-tash.

871
02:04:31,750 --> 02:04:38,460
Do you like it?

872
02:04:38,460 --> 02:04:42,420
I'm going to play a video game.

873
02:04:42,420 --> 02:04:44,420
Can I play a video game for like five minutes?

874
02:04:44,420 --> 02:04:51,319
I'm not doing that one again.

875
02:04:51,319 --> 02:04:58,420
Alright, port escape. We'll do this one.

876
02:04:58,420 --> 02:05:04,890
Suscore.

877
02:05:07,060 --> 02:05:09,060
Da da da.

878
02:05:09,060 --> 02:05:11,060
Da da da.

879
02:05:11,060 --> 02:05:21,619
Ba da da da da.

880
02:05:21,619 --> 02:05:24,630
There's no time to explain.

881
02:05:24,630 --> 02:05:26,630
You must leave the area as quick as possible.

882
02:05:26,630 --> 02:05:45,380
Reach the ferry boat at the dock.

883
02:05:45,380 --> 02:05:48,390
Not bad driving skills so far.

884
02:05:48,390 --> 02:05:59,020
Not bad driving skills so far.

885
02:05:59,020 --> 02:06:14,250
I'm stuck.

886
02:06:14,250 --> 02:06:22,949
Dude, what the fuck?

887
02:06:22,949 --> 02:06:43,100
Dude!

888
02:06:43,100 --> 02:07:00,180
This one sucks. I'm really not even doing that bad.

889
02:07:00,180 --> 02:07:04,260
What the fuck are you talking about?

890
02:07:04,260 --> 02:07:06,260
We're going to listen to this?

891
02:07:06,260 --> 02:07:08,260
Oh my god.

892
02:07:08,260 --> 02:07:10,260
Let's see how close I was to it.

893
02:07:10,260 --> 02:07:16,010
Let's see how close I was.

894
02:07:16,010 --> 02:07:18,010
Oh, this is times two.

895
02:07:18,010 --> 02:07:21,210
Hold on.

896
02:07:21,210 --> 02:07:23,210
I was fucking already-

897
02:07:33,029 --> 02:07:45,189
I don't want to listen to this anymore.

898
02:07:45,189 --> 02:07:47,189
Does anybody actually want to listen to this?

899
02:07:47,189 --> 02:07:57,619
But I-

900
02:07:57,619 --> 02:07:59,619
It's too much!

901
02:07:59,619 --> 02:08:01,619
It's too many fucking sound effects.

902
02:08:01,619 --> 02:08:04,250
It's too many.

903
02:08:04,250 --> 02:08:21,659
Who is screaming?

904
02:08:21,659 --> 02:08:24,859
Somebody is just going-

905
02:08:28,859 --> 02:08:30,859
Who is screaming?

906
02:08:30,859 --> 02:08:40,840
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

907
02:08:40,840 --> 02:08:45,449
Is it the game?

908
02:08:45,449 --> 02:08:50,819
Oh, it's the game.

909
02:08:50,819 --> 02:08:54,220
I just heard like-

910
02:08:54,220 --> 02:08:56,220
I was like-

911
02:08:56,220 --> 02:08:58,220
Who's fucking yelling?

912
02:08:58,220 --> 02:09:00,220
I was like, this is terrifying.

913
02:09:00,220 --> 02:09:04,569
I thought all the-

914
02:09:04,569 --> 02:09:06,569
I thought it was somebody screaming.

915
02:09:06,569 --> 02:09:09,939
Is it in the music?

916
02:09:11,939 --> 02:09:13,939
No, it's not.

917
02:09:18,630 --> 02:09:29,689
Listen.

918
02:09:29,689 --> 02:09:31,689
It made it fucking so much worse.

919
02:09:31,689 --> 02:09:40,460
Hold on.

920
02:09:52,789 --> 02:09:54,789
Is it in it or is that the game?

921
02:09:54,789 --> 02:10:19,560
It's both-

922
02:10:19,560 --> 02:10:30,489
No, it's not?

923
02:10:30,489 --> 02:10:39,939
What?

924
02:10:39,939 --> 02:10:41,939
My brain is so confused right now.

925
02:10:41,939 --> 02:10:43,939
I'm fucking confused.

926
02:10:43,939 --> 02:10:48,810
Do you understand what I'm saying, right?

927
02:10:48,810 --> 02:10:57,130
These are the same sound.

928
02:10:57,130 --> 02:11:19,460
It's the same sound effect.

929
02:11:19,460 --> 02:11:24,010
Did you hear the-

930
02:11:38,859 --> 02:11:40,859
Okay, I'm done.

931
02:11:40,859 --> 02:11:43,609
That was fun. That was fun.

932
02:11:43,609 --> 02:11:45,609
There's the onion ring one too, apparently.

933
02:11:45,609 --> 02:11:47,609
That was kind of good.

934
02:11:47,609 --> 02:11:50,979
What's the onion ring one? It's a conspiracy.

935
02:11:50,979 --> 02:11:54,760
Alright, what's the onion ring?

936
02:11:54,760 --> 02:12:09,659
I haven't even done the mission, guys.

937
02:12:09,659 --> 02:12:12,539
Alright, this is onion ring

938
02:12:12,539 --> 02:12:14,539
German- onion ring German remix.

939
02:12:14,539 --> 02:12:24,329
No screams.

940
02:12:24,329 --> 02:12:49,930
I have to turn this off.

941
02:13:02,659 --> 02:13:16,409
Dude.

942
02:13:16,409 --> 02:13:18,409
They're a little gross.

943
02:13:18,409 --> 02:13:22,119
But they're pretty good.

944
02:13:22,119 --> 02:13:24,119
Kind of weird, but it's not that bad.

945
02:13:24,119 --> 02:13:26,119
Um, no.

946
02:13:26,119 --> 02:13:28,119
I already hate it. I already hate it.

947
02:13:28,119 --> 02:13:30,119
It's okay.

948
02:13:30,119 --> 02:13:32,119
Final review.

949
02:13:32,119 --> 02:13:34,810
It's just weird listening to myself talk.

950
02:13:34,810 --> 02:13:37,619
6.4. Yeah, 6.4.

951
02:13:37,619 --> 02:14:06,729
How are you supposed

952
02:14:06,729 --> 02:14:20,739
to do that shit?

953
02:14:20,739 --> 02:14:22,739
This is it. This is it. This is it. This is it.

954
02:14:22,739 --> 02:14:27,100
This is it.

955
02:14:27,100 --> 02:14:51,539
This is it. This is it. Here it comes.

956
02:14:51,539 --> 02:14:57,239
Octave. I can't control

957
02:14:57,239 --> 02:15:01,140
the car. The car

958
02:15:01,140 --> 02:15:12,920
stalled out.

959
02:15:12,920 --> 02:15:14,920
I can't listen to this anymore.

960
02:15:14,920 --> 02:15:17,220
That was awesome.

961
02:15:17,220 --> 02:15:19,659
But I need to beat this level. Right now.

962
02:15:19,659 --> 02:15:21,829
I need to beat this level right now.

963
02:15:21,829 --> 02:15:29,640
Before I freak out.

964
02:15:29,640 --> 02:15:31,640
I feel like I had donation songs on, right?

965
02:15:31,640 --> 02:15:34,390
That was actually really good.

966
02:15:34,390 --> 02:15:43,210
There's another one?

967
02:15:43,210 --> 02:15:47,430
Germapenis music. What is germapenis music?

968
02:15:47,430 --> 02:16:06,039
Have I heard this one?

969
02:16:06,039 --> 02:16:09,560
Is this what I'm going to be remembered?

970
02:16:09,560 --> 02:16:12,180
I don't have a funeral or whatever.

971
02:16:12,180 --> 02:16:14,180
I guess people are going to think back like

972
02:16:14,180 --> 02:16:16,180
is this guy, this fucking

973
02:16:16,180 --> 02:16:20,600
weird guy? What's my legacy?

974
02:16:20,600 --> 02:16:24,819
Do I have one? Are you guys going to

975
02:16:24,819 --> 02:16:26,819
okay, 10, 20

976
02:16:26,819 --> 02:16:29,319
plus years from now, are you guys going to open

977
02:16:29,319 --> 02:16:31,319
up germapenis music and be nostalgic?

978
02:16:31,319 --> 02:16:33,319
And go, oh!

979
02:16:33,319 --> 02:16:35,319
Germapenis music!

980
02:16:35,319 --> 02:16:37,319
I remember that!

981
02:16:37,319 --> 02:16:46,520
Yeah!

982
02:16:46,520 --> 02:16:49,590
I guess I was younger. I thought it was

983
02:16:49,590 --> 02:16:52,219
funny I guess. I don't know.

984
02:16:52,219 --> 02:16:55,799
Maybe I was young?

985
02:16:55,799 --> 02:16:58,870
Let me give it one more chance.

986
02:16:58,870 --> 02:17:09,430
I wonder what

987
02:17:09,430 --> 02:17:11,430
that's weird. I wonder what people are going to say.

988
02:17:11,430 --> 02:17:15,340
Germapenis is

989
02:17:15,340 --> 02:17:17,639
Surma.

990
02:17:17,639 --> 02:17:20,329
Surma.

991
02:17:20,329 --> 02:17:22,329
This is depressing.

992
02:17:22,329 --> 02:17:24,329
It's not depressing. It's just funny.

993
02:17:24,329 --> 02:17:26,950
I'm just thinking of, I've gone

994
02:17:26,950 --> 02:17:28,950
back and watched Jim Carrey movies.

995
02:17:28,950 --> 02:17:30,950
Oh, The Mask, like Smokin!

996
02:17:30,950 --> 02:17:32,950
And I'm thinking of people going back and watching

997
02:17:32,950 --> 02:17:37,879
something like this.

998
02:17:37,879 --> 02:17:41,850
What the fuck are you talking about?

999
02:17:41,850 --> 02:17:46,069
You're going like that!

1000
02:17:46,069 --> 02:18:00,860
That's what I'd be doing. See that shit?

1001
02:18:00,860 --> 02:18:03,989
That's the fucking dance to this song.

1002
02:18:03,989 --> 02:18:06,870
Can you fucking trick that in?

1003
02:18:06,870 --> 02:18:29,129
Don't remember that.

1004
02:18:29,129 --> 02:18:31,129
I don't want you to remember that.

1005
02:18:31,129 --> 02:18:33,370
I want you to remember something else.

1006
02:18:33,370 --> 02:18:35,370
Don't remember that part of the stream.

1007
02:18:35,370 --> 02:18:37,370
I'm so winded.

1008
02:18:37,370 --> 02:18:43,190
Holy shit, I'm fucking

1009
02:18:43,190 --> 02:18:45,190
winded like bad!

1010
02:18:45,190 --> 02:18:48,329
What if I have to stop?

1011
02:18:48,329 --> 02:18:50,329
I could like relax for a minute. I actually like to

1012
02:18:50,329 --> 02:18:53,340
slow down. Don't remember that.

1013
02:18:53,340 --> 02:18:55,340
I want you to remember, remember like, remember Dollhouse.

1014
02:18:55,340 --> 02:18:57,340
And Replace, but don't remember

1015
02:18:57,340 --> 02:18:59,340
any of this. Don't remember any of these streams.

1016
02:18:59,340 --> 02:19:01,340
I want you to forget what you just watched. Don't watch it.

1017
02:19:01,340 --> 02:19:03,340
Think about it.

1018
02:19:03,340 --> 02:19:09,020
I want you to remember

1019
02:19:09,020 --> 02:19:11,579
the other stuff.

1020
02:19:11,579 --> 02:19:15,020
What happened? What happened?

1021
02:19:15,020 --> 02:19:21,420
Alright, I'm going for it this time for real.

1022
02:19:21,420 --> 02:19:24,409
I'm such an old

1023
02:19:24,409 --> 02:19:28,889
fuck. Are you serious?

1024
02:19:28,889 --> 02:19:30,889
I'm such an old fucking person.

1025
02:19:30,889 --> 02:19:32,889
What? I did this, I

1026
02:19:32,889 --> 02:19:34,889
danced for a second and I have to sit down.

1027
02:19:34,889 --> 02:19:37,319
I am sitting down.

1028
02:19:37,319 --> 02:19:39,620
I am sitting down right now.

1029
02:19:39,620 --> 02:19:43,340
I can't sit down any

1030
02:19:43,340 --> 02:19:45,340
more than I already am sitting down.

1031
02:19:45,340 --> 02:19:50,379
Oh my goodness.

1032
02:19:50,379 --> 02:19:52,379
Something really comical about that though.

1033
02:19:52,379 --> 02:19:54,620
Doing that dance in particular

1034
02:19:54,620 --> 02:19:56,620
you just get so winded that you're just

1035
02:19:56,620 --> 02:19:58,620
all fucked up now?

1036
02:19:58,620 --> 02:20:01,879
So too much

1037
02:20:01,879 --> 02:20:13,450
movement?

1038
02:20:13,450 --> 02:20:19,139
Just go lie in bed for a bed stream.

1039
02:20:19,139 --> 02:20:24,899
Take it easy old man. I am taking

1040
02:20:24,899 --> 02:20:28,170
it easy right now. I'm not going to

1041
02:20:28,170 --> 02:20:32,389
keel over. Do a sub-a-thon.

1042
02:20:32,389 --> 02:20:34,389
Do you understand how a sub-a-thon

1043
02:20:34,389 --> 02:20:36,389
on this channel? I would cap

1044
02:20:36,389 --> 02:20:38,700
the sub-a-thon. Guys, sub-a-thon!

1045
02:20:38,700 --> 02:20:40,700
Here we go! It's capped at 8 hours

1046
02:20:40,700 --> 02:20:43,319
by the way. That's it. I'm just

1047
02:20:43,319 --> 02:20:45,319
going to be a regular stream. I don't even care.

1048
02:20:45,319 --> 02:20:48,579
I would just say I would cap it at

1049
02:20:48,579 --> 02:20:54,280
not even a day. Or

1050
02:20:54,280 --> 02:20:56,280
one sub would

1051
02:20:56,280 --> 02:20:58,280
reduce time.

1052
02:20:58,280 --> 02:21:01,100
I would start it at

1053
02:21:01,100 --> 02:21:03,459
500 hours or something.

1054
02:21:03,459 --> 02:21:05,459
And every sub would reduce it by

1055
02:21:05,459 --> 02:21:07,639
30 seconds.

1056
02:21:07,639 --> 02:21:13,020
You guys would just force me off.

1057
02:21:13,020 --> 02:21:15,190
I didn't even fucking accelerate. I made it thank

1058
02:21:15,190 --> 02:21:34,010
God. Where do I go?

1059
02:21:34,010 --> 02:21:42,700
Excuse me? Where?

1060
02:21:42,700 --> 02:21:56,569
Jump on the boat.

1061
02:21:56,569 --> 02:21:58,569
That's how

1062
02:21:58,569 --> 02:22:04,649
the fucking movie ends.

1063
02:22:04,649 --> 02:22:06,649
They don't make that jump. It's incredibly difficult.

1064
02:22:06,649 --> 02:22:11,819
Oh.

1065
02:22:11,819 --> 02:22:13,819
Realistic. Yeah, that's

1066
02:22:13,819 --> 02:22:15,819
what would happen man. Nobody does that

1067
02:22:15,819 --> 02:22:18,379
jump. Nobody can make that jump.

1068
02:22:18,379 --> 02:22:20,379
007 failed.

1069
02:22:20,379 --> 02:22:22,379
Ay-ay-ay.

1070
02:22:22,379 --> 02:22:32,860
Okay.

1071
02:22:32,860 --> 02:22:34,860
We're relaxed now. We're relaxed.

1072
02:22:34,860 --> 02:22:47,209
I've got my breath again.

1073
02:22:47,209 --> 02:22:49,209
It was the cop thing. The siren fucked

1074
02:22:49,209 --> 02:22:53,879
me up. I've never heard of anybody

1075
02:22:53,879 --> 02:22:56,500
say the ay-ay-ay.

1076
02:22:56,500 --> 02:23:03,219
I say ay-ay-ay all the time. Ay-ay-ay

1077
02:23:03,219 --> 02:23:05,219
has so much.

1078
02:23:05,219 --> 02:23:07,219
There's so many different emotions behind it.

1079
02:23:07,219 --> 02:23:11,379
No. No, excuse me. Not

1080
02:23:11,379 --> 02:23:13,379
that one. Not with an A.

1081
02:23:13,379 --> 02:23:15,379
Ay-ay-ay!

1082
02:23:15,379 --> 02:23:17,620
Ay-ay-ay!

1083
02:23:17,620 --> 02:23:19,620
I say it all the time. It's like a thing I say.

1084
02:23:19,620 --> 02:23:23,079
I don't say. I don't do. I don't say

1085
02:23:23,079 --> 02:23:25,079
I'm not being said because everyone's going to

1086
02:23:25,079 --> 02:23:29,750
freak out. Can I shortcut? No.

1087
02:23:29,750 --> 02:23:33,340
You watch anime. I don't.

1088
02:23:33,340 --> 02:23:39,799
Somebody said birth canal.

1089
02:23:39,799 --> 02:23:45,180
What do you mean?

1090
02:23:45,180 --> 02:23:47,180
There's not going to be a birth canal ending here.

1091
02:23:47,180 --> 02:23:54,979
I need to pay attention.

1092
02:23:54,979 --> 02:23:57,350
It's okay. Did I not go through that

1093
02:23:57,350 --> 02:24:01,379
checkpoint? I didn't. How did I not hit

1094
02:24:01,379 --> 02:24:03,620
that checkpoint? I don't understand

1095
02:24:03,620 --> 02:24:05,620
how I didn't hit the. How did I not hit that

1096
02:24:05,620 --> 02:24:21,239
point? How is that possible?

1097
02:24:21,239 --> 02:24:31,610
How did I not hit the checkpoint?

1098
02:24:31,610 --> 02:24:33,610
DUN. DUN, DUN, DUN, DUN DUN,

1099
02:24:33,610 --> 02:24:35,610
DUN, DUN, DUN, DUN, DUN,

1100
02:24:35,610 --> 02:24:39,129
DUN, DUN, DUN, DUN, DUN,

1101
02:24:39,129 --> 02:24:42,709
DUN, DUN, DUN, DUN. That's such a

1102
02:24:42,709 --> 02:24:58,389
good song though. Clean,

1103
02:24:58,389 --> 02:25:00,389
clean. Clean.

1104
02:25:00,389 --> 02:25:02,629
Clean. Clean.

1105
02:25:02,629 --> 02:25:09,860
That was a clean turn.

1106
02:25:09,860 --> 02:25:19,770
Watch out!

1107
02:25:19,770 --> 02:25:21,770
Ba, ba, ba-da-da-da-da-da

1108
02:25:21,770 --> 02:25:34,379
Da. Oh.

1109
02:25:34,379 --> 02:25:36,379
Oh, reaction! Make a

1110
02:25:36,379 --> 02:25:40,379
I want to see you scream, streamer! I want to see you go whee!

1111
02:25:40,379 --> 02:25:42,579
Fuck off.

1112
02:25:42,579 --> 02:25:53,139
Alright, this is it, this is it, this is it, this is it.

1113
02:25:53,139 --> 02:26:02,860
Alright, slow down, slow down, don't go too fast.

1114
02:26:02,860 --> 02:26:20,959
I don't think I'm gonna be able to do this.

1115
02:26:20,959 --> 02:26:23,969
It still drives, it still drives, it still drives.

1116
02:26:23,969 --> 02:26:24,969
There's the checkpoint.

1117
02:26:24,969 --> 02:26:29,579
Alright, alright, alright, alright, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good.

1118
02:26:29,579 --> 02:26:37,729
Just don't be an idiot.

1119
02:26:37,729 --> 02:26:39,729
Alright, this is the far- there's no time limit, so why do I care?

1120
02:26:39,729 --> 02:26:49,840
Alright, where's the jump?

1121
02:26:49,840 --> 02:27:00,850
Um, did I make it?

1122
02:27:00,850 --> 02:27:03,149
I made it! I actually did it!

1123
02:27:03,149 --> 02:27:08,299
I got it!

1124
02:27:08,299 --> 02:27:11,459
Nice.

1125
02:27:11,459 --> 02:27:13,819
Cool, alright, that was fun. That was actually pretty fun.

1126
02:27:13,819 --> 02:27:19,700
What's another one I should do?

1127
02:27:19,700 --> 02:27:21,510
Leap of Fate?

1128
02:27:21,510 --> 02:27:30,690
Try this one.

1129
02:27:30,690 --> 02:27:32,569
Do some more free roam?

1130
02:27:32,569 --> 02:27:38,889
I like these scenarios of fun.

1131
02:27:38,889 --> 02:27:39,889
This took you an hour.

1132
02:27:39,889 --> 02:27:44,889
Well, you have to be fair, there was a whole lot going on in the first 15 to 20 minutes of that run.

1133
02:27:44,889 --> 02:27:47,959
Your hair looks like a backwards hat.

1134
02:27:47,959 --> 02:27:59,809
It does?

1135
02:27:59,809 --> 02:28:00,809
I don't know what you're talking about.

1136
02:28:00,809 --> 02:28:16,549
Down up the cliffs, finishing with a courageous leap onto a rock pillar.

1137
02:28:16,549 --> 02:28:18,549
Oh, that's a good camera angle.

1138
02:28:18,549 --> 02:28:54,180
Nobody said it had to be clean.

1139
02:28:54,180 --> 02:28:55,180
I can't see.

1140
02:28:55,180 --> 02:28:59,620
Oh, fuck off.

1141
02:28:59,620 --> 02:29:01,620
Alright, just let me- I'm just doing it this way.

1142
02:29:11,100 --> 02:29:19,959
Slow down.

1143
02:29:19,959 --> 02:29:21,959
It's not about how cool you look, it's about getting it done.

1144
02:29:21,959 --> 02:29:28,059
This is a pretty good speed.

1145
02:29:28,059 --> 02:29:32,350
Oh, come on.

1146
02:29:32,350 --> 02:29:38,010
Stop.

1147
02:29:38,010 --> 02:29:39,010
Stop.

1148
02:29:39,010 --> 02:29:41,530
Stop it.

1149
02:29:41,530 --> 02:30:10,290
Really?

1150
02:30:10,290 --> 02:30:11,290
Forget about being cautious.

1151
02:30:11,290 --> 02:30:17,010
Fuck it, just go.

1152
02:30:17,010 --> 02:30:19,850
This one's impossible.

1153
02:30:19,850 --> 02:30:36,190
This one's impossible.

1154
02:30:36,190 --> 02:30:40,440
What the?

1155
02:30:40,440 --> 02:30:41,440
How are you supposed to go over that?

1156
02:30:41,440 --> 02:30:46,329
Go very slow?

1157
02:30:46,329 --> 02:30:47,329
I just went so slow.

1158
02:30:47,329 --> 02:31:11,930
Look at how slow I just went, it just hit me over.

1159
02:31:11,930 --> 02:31:15,729
STOP!

1160
02:31:15,729 --> 02:31:16,729
Oh my god, dude.

1161
02:31:16,729 --> 02:31:17,729
Give me a break.

1162
02:31:17,729 --> 02:31:24,559
Let me try this one more time.

1163
02:31:24,559 --> 02:31:30,920
One more time.

1164
02:31:30,920 --> 02:31:31,920
Play the video.

1165
02:31:31,920 --> 02:31:55,819
Sammy, please.

1166
02:31:55,819 --> 02:31:56,819
I beg you.

1167
02:31:56,819 --> 02:31:59,979
Meal, Sammy.

1168
02:31:59,979 --> 02:32:00,979
Fast.

1169
02:32:00,979 --> 02:32:01,979
Medium.

1170
02:32:01,979 --> 02:32:08,139
Left.

1171
02:32:08,139 --> 02:32:09,139
Stay center.

1172
02:32:09,139 --> 02:32:14,420
Please.

1173
02:32:14,420 --> 02:32:27,180
Medium.

1174
02:32:27,180 --> 02:32:28,180
Left.

1175
02:32:28,180 --> 02:32:29,180
Long.

1176
02:32:29,180 --> 02:32:35,340
Medium.

1177
02:32:35,340 --> 02:32:38,700
Right.

1178
02:32:38,700 --> 02:32:39,700
Concentrate.

1179
02:32:39,700 --> 02:32:41,190
Medium.

1180
02:32:41,190 --> 02:32:42,190
Left.

1181
02:32:42,190 --> 02:32:43,190
Meal.

1182
02:32:43,190 --> 02:32:44,190
Short.

1183
02:32:44,190 --> 02:32:45,190
Left.

1184
02:32:45,190 --> 02:32:47,200
Sammy, listen, Sammy.

1185
02:32:47,200 --> 02:32:48,200
Otherwise, it's not working, Sammy.

1186
02:32:48,200 --> 02:32:49,200
Seriously.

1187
02:32:49,200 --> 02:32:50,200
You are watching and driving.

1188
02:32:50,200 --> 02:32:51,200
You have to be easy, Sammy.

1189
02:32:51,200 --> 02:32:52,200
Otherwise, we won't win it.

1190
02:32:52,200 --> 02:32:53,200
You have to be easy, Sammy.

1191
02:32:53,200 --> 02:32:55,209
I'm telling you.

1192
02:32:55,209 --> 02:33:07,389
Where am I going?

1193
02:33:07,389 --> 02:33:12,409
Shut up, Sammy.

1194
02:33:12,409 --> 02:33:25,100
Stay on, Sammy.

1195
02:33:25,100 --> 02:33:47,340
Sammy, what are you...

1196
02:33:47,340 --> 02:33:48,340
We made it.

1197
02:33:48,340 --> 02:33:49,700
Fine.

1198
02:33:49,700 --> 02:33:50,700
We made it.

1199
02:33:50,700 --> 02:33:57,340
I don't know what direction I was supposed to be going.

1200
02:33:57,340 --> 02:34:04,420
Where am I going?

1201
02:34:04,420 --> 02:34:06,420
You got to stay on the road.

1202
02:34:06,420 --> 02:34:07,420
Oh, fuck it.

1203
02:34:07,420 --> 02:34:08,420
I'm done with this one.

1204
02:34:08,420 --> 02:34:09,420
This one was cool, but it's very hard.

1205
02:34:09,420 --> 02:34:11,420
I want to do the leap of faith though.

1206
02:34:11,420 --> 02:34:14,200
Where is it?

1207
02:34:14,200 --> 02:34:16,200
Where is the leap of faith?

1208
02:34:16,200 --> 02:34:17,200
It was a path.

1209
02:34:17,200 --> 02:34:38,000
I know, but I kind of went off the path.

1210
02:34:38,000 --> 02:34:39,000
Really?

1211
02:34:39,000 --> 02:34:52,850
Come on.

1212
02:34:52,850 --> 02:34:53,850
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.

1213
02:34:53,850 --> 02:35:18,159
That was fun. I want to do that one's too hard. Delivery? Deliver a trailer of Tasty Cola to the shop.

1214
02:35:18,159 --> 02:35:43,340
All right, go do some more smashing. I will. I will. Audio delay? Shouldn't be. Are you gonna do a Roblox stream?

1215
02:35:43,340 --> 02:35:54,780
No, one guy. Okay, deliver a

1216
02:35:55,299 --> 02:36:09,459
Trailer of Tasty Cola to the city. You got it. Oh, I need, oh.

1217
02:36:10,180 --> 02:36:18,120
I'm gonna go in the water.

1218
02:36:20,629 --> 02:36:49,799
All right. Well, just do it any, whatever. How do I put it on? Is there traffic or if there's no traffic I should be okay.

1219
02:36:50,079 --> 02:37:10,540
I should be fine, right? Who says I have to go fast?

1220
02:37:21,219 --> 02:37:29,090
What? Where's my height?

1221
02:37:38,540 --> 02:37:51,489
Sorry, how high should I be? This is a sharp right. Be careful. You guys remember those shoes that you used to pump?

1222
02:37:51,690 --> 02:37:57,399
What were those things called? I think they were just called pumps, right? Pumper's or something.

1223
02:37:57,520 --> 02:38:08,309
They're on the tongue of the shoe. You went, they were crazy. What were they called? Pumper's? Air Max.

1224
02:38:08,729 --> 02:38:13,879
Yeah, they were weird and all it did is just tightened to the shoe around you. It just kind of filled up air.

1225
02:38:14,239 --> 02:38:30,329
They were weird. I don't think they make them anymore. My eyes. I'm being so irritated. Okay, here we go. Let's deliver.

1226
02:38:30,729 --> 02:38:49,079
Deliver our delivery. What? I don't even know what happened. I just can't see. I can't, I just couldn't see.

1227
02:38:49,079 --> 02:38:52,090
I couldn't see where the car was driving.

1228
02:38:52,610 --> 02:39:13,739
What's, what's wrong with the car? I can't turn right. I actually can't turn the car right. What? Give me a break.

1229
02:39:14,219 --> 02:39:30,379
You gotta be kidding me. What was that? All right. I, I was gonna go back and smash cars into each other.

1230
02:39:30,899 --> 02:39:48,450
Okay, let me put the air, let me pump the air maxes. Now I'm ready. It's into my calls.

1231
02:39:49,209 --> 02:39:58,500
Driving a truck must, this must be the most terrifying thing.

1232
02:40:00,760 --> 02:40:06,610
Seriously, what an, what an unbelievable skill it takes to do this, to actually drive around like this.

1233
02:40:06,610 --> 02:40:13,989
I am, I already don't know sometimes if, that's, that turn looks kind of sharp. I gotta be careful.

1234
02:40:14,229 --> 02:40:18,840
Can you imagine what goes through the mind of somebody driving a truck like this when you have to take a sharp turn like that?

1235
02:40:19,200 --> 02:40:27,940
It's like, you have this insane huge thing. That's a skill. That's a heavy skill.

1236
02:40:28,500 --> 02:40:39,229
Your brother does this for a living? That's, that takes a lot of guts. It does. That takes a lot of balls.

1237
02:40:39,229 --> 02:40:48,159
It takes a lot of gumshoe to be able to drive something like this, especially around like a place like this.

1238
02:40:52,510 --> 02:40:55,629
I would be, I wouldn't know what to do. I would get out. I'd be like, somebody else has to drive this.

1239
02:40:56,110 --> 02:41:02,180
Somebody else has to do this. Wait, gumshoe. Isn't that what they called the

1240
02:41:03,190 --> 02:41:15,569
kid, the detective kids in, we're in the world's car in San Diego? Gumshoes. Yeah. What was I trying to say?

1241
02:41:16,370 --> 02:41:24,780
Gumshoes. Yeah. And I didn't even pay attention to the road. Where's the checkpoint? I gotta stop talking.

1242
02:41:24,780 --> 02:41:36,989
Oh my God. I can't do anything like this. What a great theme song, too. Should I start over again?

1243
02:41:37,629 --> 02:41:45,579
I can't just turn around. I can't just do a three-point turn. You know, my favorite part about

1244
02:41:45,579 --> 02:41:52,100
the, we're in the world's car in San Diego theme song. First of all, the beginning, it goes

1245
02:41:55,620 --> 02:42:00,209
That's a big part. And then in the middle, it's like,

1246
02:42:03,250 --> 02:42:13,840
the second verse went, where am I going? The part where the guy goes, stealing souls and stuff from

1247
02:42:14,399 --> 02:42:19,600
That's my, that, hold on. I could do that better. Stealing soul and stuff from making money.

1248
02:42:20,959 --> 02:42:33,809
That's the best part. Let's listen to it right now. What a classic. Oh, did you hear that part?

1249
02:42:33,809 --> 02:42:42,590
That's what I'm talking about. Let's wait for the next part. Oh, this is a fucking classic.

1250
02:43:04,290 --> 02:43:16,030
And here it goes, here it goes.

1251
02:43:16,829 --> 02:43:25,069
We go from Nashville to Norway, to Zimbabwe, to Chicago, to Czechoslovakia, and back.

1252
02:43:25,870 --> 02:43:41,659
I'm just crashing. I can't play video games and do this. I can't play a car driving video game.

1253
02:43:42,299 --> 02:43:48,059
We have to be careful. I can't turn the car anymore. We're not doing this one. We can do

1254
02:43:48,059 --> 02:43:54,540
something else. What? Okay. One more scenario. I want to finish the song though. It's a good song.

1255
02:44:02,959 --> 02:44:08,500
Carmen San Diego. Whoa.

1256
02:44:12,340 --> 02:44:18,180
I'm going to DMCA'd. It's a 1991 Carmen San Diego theme song for a game show.

1257
02:44:21,340 --> 02:44:35,860
What do you want me to do? Just give me the main menu.

1258
02:44:35,860 --> 02:45:09,389
Oh, dude. And then another one from this, at the very end of the game show, they had to go find

1259
02:45:09,469 --> 02:45:12,590
different countries and place little markers on them when they were like, oh, this is,

1260
02:45:12,590 --> 02:45:17,149
they would describe an area or describe a thing. The person had to put a little marker on a country

1261
02:45:17,149 --> 02:45:23,940
from where it was from. And the song, the song that they did, it's the same group. What's the

1262
02:45:23,940 --> 02:45:34,190
group? What's the name of the group? Okay. It was an acapella group. It was this. It was awesome.

1263
02:45:34,190 --> 02:45:43,500
I got to hear that too. What would it be called? Rockapella. Yep. That's the one. Okay. Let's do

1264
02:45:44,459 --> 02:45:56,190
where in the world is Carmen San Diego? Bum-de-bum, bum-de-bum, like bum-de-bum, bum-de-bum,

1265
02:45:57,309 --> 02:46:08,750
bum-de-bum. You guys know what I'm talking about? Carmen San Diego. What would it be called? Play

1266
02:46:08,750 --> 02:46:13,389
the game, please. This is really fucking important. Not Perry the Platypus theme. What are you? Get

1267
02:46:13,389 --> 02:46:22,270
out of here. That's no, that's not it. Where in the world is Carmen San Diego? Great core.

1268
02:46:22,909 --> 02:46:40,319
If somebody find it, I gotta go through this. Oh my God. All right. I didn't know I had that much

1269
02:46:40,319 --> 02:47:08,450
speed. What? I got it though. No, I got it. I got it. I got it. This thing's wicked fucked up,

1270
02:47:08,450 --> 02:47:52,510
but I got it. Oh, these tight turns. Oh shit. Find it. Oh, you got it. You got it. Is it?

1271
02:47:52,510 --> 02:48:08,979
This is the one I was talking about. This is the one I'm talking about. That's not it.

1272
02:48:09,780 --> 02:48:32,829
What the fuck? It was an opera. This is not it. This is not it. No, it's not even close.

1273
02:48:32,829 --> 02:48:41,069
It's bum-de-bum, bum-de-bum, bum-de-bum. This is an opera. This is a chorus singing opera.

1274
02:48:46,219 --> 02:48:55,309
No, that's not it. That's not it. It's from the TV show. It's from the game show. It's from the

1275
02:48:55,309 --> 02:49:02,659
game show. It was the very end. It was a kid. It was the last part of the show. It was the kid

1276
02:49:02,659 --> 02:49:06,340
running around with a marker and they had to place it on this big map they were running all over.

1277
02:49:06,899 --> 02:49:21,440
And he was like, I'll find Norway. And the kid had to run around and place it on Norway. Oh,

1278
02:49:21,440 --> 02:49:33,420
no way do I get out of here. Oh my God. It's so hard. Yep. Is this it? They said I can't

1279
02:49:33,420 --> 02:49:44,450
hear it very well, but this is it. Get set, go. Come on to Chad. Chad. This is it. Chad.

1280
02:49:44,450 --> 02:49:54,700
No, that's not it. Try it again. Come on, Tetsuo. Yeah, that's it. Come on. Yes, sir. Come on.

1281
02:50:00,639 --> 02:50:09,469
You got it. Come on. You got it. Come on. All right, we can go back.

1282
02:50:10,030 --> 02:50:12,989
There's like 3,000 of you that left and came back. You can come back now.

1283
02:50:17,180 --> 02:50:26,860
Where is Carmen Sandiego? What the fuck is opera? Oh, you know that one that goes bum-de-bum,

1284
02:50:27,819 --> 02:50:47,489
bum-de-bum. I'm just going to do the fucking crash and just upload. It's much more my speed,

1285
02:50:47,489 --> 02:51:02,319
I think. That's way more my speed. Oh, Jungle Rock Island. Let's go. Where should I go?

1286
02:51:02,319 --> 02:51:08,860
Do one of the chases. Oh, wait a minute. Oh, that's a good idea. That's not fun. All right.

1287
02:51:08,860 --> 02:51:16,659
East Coast chase one. This one's a medium difficulty. How are you so consistently bad

1288
02:51:16,659 --> 02:51:35,040
at this game? Because I'm doing it to deliberately make you angry. You only. Only you. Only you.

1289
02:51:35,040 --> 02:51:40,079
All right. I wanted individuals to be spotted near the sawmill. Somebody fell into the lake.

1290
02:51:45,440 --> 02:52:06,829
I'm just kidding. Relax. There they are. It's a realistic driving game. Sorry I don't have a

1291
02:52:06,829 --> 02:52:16,219
pedal or a steering wheel. I did the tutorial an hour and 10 minutes ago. What do you want me to

1292
02:52:16,219 --> 02:52:34,719
say? This car drives like shit. It's one of those cars that drives like shit. All right,

1293
02:52:34,719 --> 02:52:45,790
get slowed down. All right. Don't peel out here. That's what happened last time. And just wait.

1294
02:52:45,790 --> 02:52:51,790
He's going to jump. Do the jump. There it is. This dirt ass road that I can't drive on. This

1295
02:52:51,790 --> 02:52:59,090
car is not meant to drive on this road. Where'd you go? All right. Keep going. This. Um,

1296
02:52:59,809 --> 02:53:07,950
did I cut him off or something? Or was I supposed to go that way? I don't know which way he went.

1297
02:53:08,510 --> 02:53:16,909
Did he go this way? I don't know which way. I don't know which way the fucking guy went.

1298
02:53:18,059 --> 02:53:25,340
This is so hard. This is so hard. I feel like I'm driving. I feel like I'm driving every car in

1299
02:53:25,340 --> 02:53:33,260
this game in an ice in one of those tabletop ice hockey rinks. What are they called? Air hockey.

1300
02:53:33,260 --> 02:53:40,850
All these cars are air hockey rinks. It's just I'm playing fucking air hockey.

1301
02:53:41,409 --> 02:54:34,860
Fucking God. It wouldn't. It doesn't. It's not hard to do that. How am I supposed to get this

1302
02:54:34,860 --> 02:54:44,180
close? I'm pushing. I'm doing 70 fucking miles per hour and I'm doing these tight turns. I'm

1303
02:54:44,180 --> 02:54:58,620
going to crash. Where'd he go? Where'd he go? Where'd he go? This way. It's fucking impossible.

1304
02:54:58,620 --> 02:55:03,809
It is so hard to drive in this game. This is the hardest driving game I've ever done in my

1305
02:55:03,809 --> 02:55:13,729
fucking life. It is so difficult to drive car in this game. You got to drift. Yeah. When I

1306
02:55:13,729 --> 02:55:25,059
start drifting, I don't stop drifting and I just don't. I can't turn the car. I can't even turn

1307
02:55:25,059 --> 02:55:57,379
the car. I can't turn. I feel like I'm in a tank. This is slippery ass bullshit. I'm on icicles

1308
02:55:57,379 --> 02:56:08,659
right now. I'm driving on a bed of ice on every course. I have no control of the car. Do you see

1309
02:56:08,659 --> 02:56:32,909
this? I don't have any control. I have no control of the car. I don't. I actually don't have control.

1310
02:56:32,909 --> 02:56:37,870
Those of you who think this is like GTA 5 driving, you are out of your fucking mind.

1311
02:56:38,590 --> 02:56:44,430
Those of you who think that, dude, what the fuck? This is not GTA 5 driving. This is very, very

1312
02:56:44,430 --> 02:57:18,059
difficult. It's very difficult. It's incredibly difficult. Where the fuck is he? I didn't even

1313
02:57:18,059 --> 02:57:45,280
pay attention. Just crash. I don't care. This one's easy. Relax. I think your next game intuition is

1314
02:57:45,920 --> 02:57:52,540
no, no, I don't need next game. It's really hard. I'm relaxed. I'm fine. I'm just very mad about

1315
02:57:52,540 --> 02:58:00,979
sliding around on icicles in my car. And then when I turn the wheel like this, the car just goes,

1316
02:58:18,430 --> 02:58:20,909
how am I supposed to know that? That's how I'm supposed to know where I'm supposed to go.

1317
02:59:18,739 --> 02:59:24,059
All right. I'm fucking doing this one. I don't care. Why does his mouth not move?

1318
02:59:24,799 --> 02:59:28,639
I don't know because sometimes my mouth doesn't move. Sometimes your mouth doesn't move when you

1319
02:59:28,639 --> 02:59:33,520
scream. I'll fuck with, yeah, I'll fuck with gravity. I'll do that. I'm going to get out of it.

1320
02:59:33,520 --> 02:59:40,940
It's so addicting. But I was literally, I was pressing left so hard that the stick came out of

1321
02:59:40,940 --> 03:00:34,190
its socket. It went even more left. It went over heel left. He crashed. I did it. I won.

1322
03:00:36,819 --> 03:00:46,909
He crashed without me. Just get in front of the car. Dude, he's done. He's done. He's not going

1323
03:00:46,909 --> 03:00:59,059
anywhere. You're not going to escape, man. It's over. I don't know what you crashed into,

1324
03:00:59,620 --> 03:01:22,510
but I got you. All right. One more. Whoa. This one. He still chips.

1325
03:01:31,440 --> 03:01:41,219
All right. Jump from the dam and aim for the targets. Fuck it. Who cares? Just go.

1326
03:01:44,500 --> 03:01:59,409
All right. Well, I didn't know what it was going to be. This person just showing up.

1327
03:01:59,409 --> 03:02:08,209
Get on the road. All right. Up and over. All right. How many points did I get? Zero.

1328
03:02:16,430 --> 03:02:20,750
Okay. I didn't. I actually didn't even. What? Okay. This is. Do it again. Do it again.

1329
03:02:31,299 --> 03:02:54,989
Oh, you got to go really slow. Now you speed it up. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it.

1330
03:02:58,430 --> 03:03:39,809
Slow down a little bit. Way too short. I think that's it. Oh, yes. Got it. That was almost

1331
03:03:39,809 --> 03:03:46,139
a perfect bullseye. Let's do it again. This one even further. How am I going to get the one all

1332
03:03:46,139 --> 03:03:51,420
the way back there? That one seems really far away. All the way in the back in the river.

1333
03:03:58,340 --> 03:04:05,569
I don't think I'm going to hit that one. How are you supposed to get that one? Look at that.

1334
03:04:05,569 --> 03:04:18,940
Don't do the taxi. Oh, okay. I thought I had to use this car. We'll do a super fast car.

1335
03:04:19,500 --> 03:04:41,780
What's the fastest car in the game? It's not even close to being fast.

1336
03:04:42,739 --> 03:05:02,750
That's not going to do it. I need the rocket bus. Will that actually do it? How do I press the

1337
03:05:02,750 --> 03:05:52,319
button? Holy shit. That turned into a piece of taffy. All right. I get it. Way too powerful.

1338
03:06:14,219 --> 03:06:59,870
I got to try to get it. That was fun. That was fun. How about cliff?

1339
03:07:05,809 --> 03:07:44,780
Cliff. And we'll use this one. Really, it's just a cliff. So a lot of people say,

1340
03:07:45,420 --> 03:07:50,079
man, look at all this technology with the soft body damage and the car damage. This is so cool.

1341
03:07:50,639 --> 03:07:57,389
Everybody was talking about how cool this was when this game came out, right? In about five

1342
03:07:57,389 --> 03:08:04,270
to 10 years almost. The reason why they can't put this in games and why most car damage is kind of,

1343
03:08:04,270 --> 03:08:10,350
it's okay, is because my computer right now is spending all of its resources rendering that.

1344
03:08:13,010 --> 03:08:20,530
And correct me if I'm wrong, but you kind of can't render that everywhere. That accurate?

1345
03:08:25,329 --> 03:08:36,459
Maybe one day. That was really fun. Let me do it with a fast car. Let me do it with the bus.

1346
03:08:36,459 --> 03:08:56,219
No, what the fuck? I'm trying to go fast. This thing broke his neck. Start over. Start over.

1347
03:08:56,219 --> 03:09:27,979
Again. R. How come R's not working? R's not working. R. There we go. Wait, I want to see

1348
03:09:27,979 --> 03:10:01,940
from here. Where am I? I want to get a bit. I want to, there we go. That's better.

1349
03:10:07,649 --> 03:10:21,819
That was tons of damage. That's what in this part of the movie, all the main characters are all,

1350
03:10:22,940 --> 03:10:27,579
maybe one of them has a scratch right here with a little bit of blood and a tiny bruise.

1351
03:10:27,579 --> 03:10:35,760
And they all go in like this. Is everything okay? One person's kind of lying down in dirt here.

1352
03:10:35,760 --> 03:10:58,899
They're all fine. All right. Let's do another map. I want to do, I want some more cars on the road.

1353
03:10:58,899 --> 03:11:07,649
How about, how about just East Coast USA? Gas station, parking lot, farmhouse, town, highway.

1354
03:11:07,649 --> 03:11:14,319
Ooh, let's do the highway. Change the gravity. Yeah. I'm going to do a bunch of weird shit.

1355
03:11:16,420 --> 03:11:22,659
Let's turn traffic on. Let's do, there's probably a piece of big thing of concrete in the way.

1356
03:11:22,659 --> 03:11:38,659
Do the sawmill. Still haven't done the cannon. It's been three hours and no cannon.

1357
03:11:38,659 --> 03:11:47,540
A hundred times slower than real time. What? Okay. That's kind of insane. All right. I want,

1358
03:11:47,540 --> 03:12:06,100
I want a different car. I want to drive this, just like a van or something. This is a Scooby-Doo van.

1359
03:12:06,100 --> 03:12:22,000
Is this the mystery machine? It actually is. Okay. Go to the environments tab. Play. Okay. Noon.

1360
03:12:22,000 --> 03:12:41,149
Go to noon. Cloud speed. Fog. It gets foggy. Simulation speed. Gravity. Moon. Okay. Let's do

1361
03:12:41,149 --> 03:13:03,569
vehicle config. Okay. Zoinks. And now I need to do, I want AI. Traffic. Spawn traffic. And let's

1362
03:13:03,569 --> 03:13:23,469
give it a shot. It's spawning a lot of cars. Okay. Here we go. Let's, let's drive. We need a shaggy

1363
03:13:23,469 --> 03:13:33,780
impression. Like, oh, this is quality entertainment. Like, this is quality entertainment,

1364
03:13:33,780 --> 03:13:48,530
Scoob. Not bad. Not bad. That wasn't bad. It actually wasn't even bad. That actually was not

1365
03:13:48,530 --> 03:14:13,899
bad. That actually wasn't. I wasn't. Should we just put on the Scooby-Doo theme song and just drive

1366
03:14:13,899 --> 03:14:20,430
around? I love how this stream has just seriously been, put on a song and drive to the song until

1367
03:14:20,430 --> 03:14:25,459
you crash into a wall. This is the only thing we've been, that's all the content. That's the

1368
03:14:25,459 --> 03:14:31,059
content of the entire day. It's been, it's been every single piece of content that we have done

1369
03:14:31,059 --> 03:14:38,459
for over three plus three and a half hours. It's great. It's great content. It's amazing content.

1370
03:14:38,459 --> 03:14:43,340
Okay. So here's the deal. Um, okay. If we're going to make it at night, it's going to be

1371
03:14:43,340 --> 03:14:49,040
spooky. And we're going to put on the mystery machine theme song of whatever the hell it is.

1372
03:14:49,040 --> 03:15:16,670
Okay. Whatever. This is, um, Scooby. What's, what's new Scooby-Doo? Is that a good one?

1373
03:15:16,670 --> 03:15:23,950
Yeah, I find that mystery. This is Scooby-Doo. Coming after you. Fuck the Scooby-Doo.

1374
03:15:24,670 --> 03:15:30,100
This is the fucking new Zoomer shit. This is not what I want. This is the new Zoomer shit.

1375
03:15:30,100 --> 03:15:45,329
And by the way, that song is very good. I, I, I'm full of shit by the way. Actually,

1376
03:15:45,329 --> 03:15:56,690
this one might be better than the original. This one might be better than the original song.

1377
03:15:56,690 --> 03:16:04,510
That's better than the original song. Really? And I think it might be. All right, let's get,

1378
03:16:04,510 --> 03:16:13,899
let's get, uh, what we want here. I want it to be nighttime. I'm going to go solve that mystery.

1379
03:16:14,299 --> 03:16:20,079
Make it foggy. Right? Nice. Ooh, scary. Earth gravity. No more of this bullshit.

1380
03:16:20,079 --> 03:16:28,299
Okay. Now I need, I need, uh, headlights. How do I turn the headlights on? How do you turn on

1381
03:16:28,299 --> 03:16:45,729
the headlights? And I gotta, I gotta be off camera. I need my headlights. L plus shut off.

1382
03:16:45,729 --> 03:16:52,780
Wow. What is it? T? How do I turn the headlights on? N. Okay. Thank you.

1383
03:16:53,420 --> 03:16:56,979
All right. You guys ready? You guys ready for, to solve the mystery? You ready to do the joke

1384
03:16:56,979 --> 03:17:00,899
we've done 10 times today? I, I hope you're ready. Here we go.

1385
03:17:03,219 --> 03:17:09,020
Time to solve that mystery. Wait, let me turn this down. This is going to be so loud.

1386
03:17:09,020 --> 03:17:14,590
All right, dude, we're just replacing the actors. We're doing the same movie.

1387
03:17:22,819 --> 03:17:38,479
Okay. Here we go. It's too dark.

1388
03:17:57,889 --> 03:18:01,170
It's too dark, man. I can't actually guess where I'm driving.

1389
03:18:03,329 --> 03:18:09,340
Yeah. All right. I'll try it again. I have to do it until I can. Okay. Here's the,

1390
03:18:09,340 --> 03:18:13,360
are you guys ready for the fucking challenge of the evening? The challenge of the evening is

1391
03:18:13,360 --> 03:18:19,940
I'm going to try to drive pretty much. I can't go under 20 miles per hour or at least the intro of

1392
03:18:19,940 --> 03:18:28,100
this show. I have to try to do this for the intro of the show. Just one full intro. You ready? Here

1393
03:18:28,100 --> 03:19:23,229
we go. What's headlights? I'll try it again. I'll try it again. I need to have the headlights on

1394
03:19:24,989 --> 03:19:30,239
and are they on? All right. Let me get to a different fucking spot. Like let me get to a

1395
03:19:30,239 --> 03:19:35,709
different spot. This spot sucks. It's, I can't see what I'm doing. I can't see where I'm going

1396
03:19:35,709 --> 03:20:07,739
and I gotta hold on. They gotta make this even better. Come on. Come on. Okay. Here we go. How

1397
03:20:07,739 --> 03:20:15,569
is this going to sound? Let's see. I'm just going to put on like just background voice lines from

1398
03:20:15,569 --> 03:20:22,770
the, okay. This should be pretty, this should be all right. I need to get a better spot too, dude.

1399
03:20:22,770 --> 03:20:32,129
Like this is going to be too hard. Let me get across the bridge. I gotta make sure the audio

1400
03:20:32,129 --> 03:20:35,170
isn't all fucked up too. All right. I want to make sure, let me turn the fog down because you

1401
03:20:35,170 --> 03:20:43,340
can't see shit. Turn the fog down. That's way better. Now we can actually see what we're doing.

1402
03:20:43,340 --> 03:20:59,329
Okay. You guys ready? I'm ready. I'm ready to start this. I gotta get through one cycle.

1403
03:21:02,979 --> 03:21:08,979
Let me get over here. One cycle of the theme song. That's all I'm looking for.

1404
03:21:09,940 --> 03:21:18,940
Set this to home. Thank you for reminding me. Sounds good. Okay. Make sure the audio levels are

1405
03:21:18,940 --> 03:21:48,700
good in three, two, one. It's too soft. It's too soft. The music's overpowering everything.

1406
03:21:53,889 --> 03:21:55,889
That was the worst one by far.

1407
03:21:56,370 --> 03:22:05,840
The gang calls the insurance company. All right. I need a good, okay. This is a better audio level.

1408
03:22:06,639 --> 03:22:23,180
Okay. Okay. All right. All right. All right. You guys ready? I'm going to start over again.

1409
03:22:23,180 --> 03:22:31,340
I have to do this till I get through one cycle. And turn the headlights on. Three, two, one.

1410
03:22:33,819 --> 03:23:24,379
What? God damn it. Okay. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right.

1411
03:23:24,379 --> 03:23:40,500
I'm going to do this one more time and I'm moving on again. Final time. Final time. Two times the song.

1412
03:24:17,389 --> 03:24:20,670
That's so fucked up. That's so fucked up. Like we're going to crash.

1413
03:24:24,540 --> 03:24:30,850
God damn it. All right. Let's go. Ready? Hey, Scooby-Doo. What's new? What's new, Scooby-Doo?

1414
03:24:30,850 --> 03:26:10,319
How are you? The car is so fucked up. I feel like my brain is rotting.

1415
03:27:31,920 --> 03:27:36,620
All right. Hold on. I need to pause. I need to pause. My fucking head hurts.

1416
03:27:36,620 --> 03:27:42,670
Scooby went through the shack. How many times has Scooby crashed?

1417
03:27:44,420 --> 03:27:53,579
I feel like I was rotting your brains. I'm so sorry. I feel like everybody just is dumber

1418
03:27:53,579 --> 03:27:59,059
because of what just happened. I think everybody collectively, if they were ever going to be a

1419
03:27:59,059 --> 03:28:04,379
scientist, they'd want to do some observation here. The last five minutes, I think, may have

1420
03:28:04,379 --> 03:28:09,500
dropped everybody's IQ here by five points. I think it happened. I really think it might have

1421
03:28:09,500 --> 03:28:27,299
happened. I'm sorry. This has been playing the whole time muted. I'm back. That's too much.

1422
03:28:27,299 --> 03:28:41,920
Oh, Scooby, you can't stop. What an absolute nightmare. Digitally, why would you? I have a

1423
03:28:41,920 --> 03:28:57,950
test tomorrow. Why would you do that to me? God, what happened here? My favorite one, I think,

1424
03:28:58,430 --> 03:29:03,309
is the bus. Just immediately, the intro starts and they crash directly into a bus.

1425
03:29:03,309 --> 03:29:08,110
Immediately. The intro doesn't even happen yet. Here we go. Let's go on.

1426
03:29:12,180 --> 03:29:16,479
Finals are coming up. Oh, they are. That's right. Well, good luck on them. Hope you do all right.

1427
03:29:19,409 --> 03:29:30,620
Do Torgos theme. What's this Scooby do? Coming after you. I just want to hear the song now.

1428
03:29:30,620 --> 03:29:36,129
What a great tune. You know what I mean? It's a great song.

1429
03:29:45,440 --> 03:30:07,680
Who made this? Who made this one? Simple plan. Great job. I mean, they actually did a great job.

1430
03:30:07,680 --> 03:30:12,959
You know, here's the thing. A lot of times they have a popular band at the time do a theme song

1431
03:30:12,959 --> 03:30:16,719
for a show. Usually like, whoa, hold on a second there. I'm not so sure about that.

1432
03:30:19,069 --> 03:30:27,309
This is very, very good. They've ruined it. No, not this one. I think this is a good modern

1433
03:30:27,309 --> 03:30:39,040
take on it. I think it's great. I think they did a fantastic job. This is horrible. That was not.

1434
03:30:39,680 --> 03:31:03,329
This is not simple plan. And why is this in the road? Why was that in the road?

1435
03:31:03,329 --> 03:31:09,809
It is simple plan. All right. Well, they did a great job. All right. I want to change,

1436
03:31:09,809 --> 03:31:26,639
change scenery. I want to change scenery. I hit that earlier. I did go back to the grid.

1437
03:31:26,639 --> 03:31:46,829
Go to Utah, Utah. Let me go to the, uh, Jesus. What should I go? Scooby do devs in the chat.

1438
03:31:46,829 --> 03:31:54,479
That'd be weird considering thousands of people have worked on that show over the last 60 years.

1439
03:31:54,479 --> 03:32:01,379
It'd be, uh, okay. What do you mean the dev is here? Oh, maybe the repair zone.

1440
03:32:01,379 --> 03:32:12,399
Let's check this out. The dev, the dev is here.

1441
03:32:24,510 --> 03:32:32,100
All right. How's this one look? And the gas station explode. Zero. Give it a zero. Give the

1442
03:32:32,100 --> 03:32:47,969
game a zero. I can't move. I want to spawn. What is this thing here? What's the bus for?

1443
03:32:47,969 --> 03:33:08,479
This bus station thing. Bus driver. What is that? Mr. Do is here. Mr. Scooby do. Oh,

1444
03:33:08,479 --> 03:33:17,090
it's like a desert bus. Okay. I'm on a new car. First of all, manage, manage select.

1445
03:33:21,739 --> 03:33:25,809
I have not played with the cannon. So I'm going to take it out. These people are saying play with

1446
03:33:25,809 --> 03:33:31,280
the cannon, bro. Have you not shot the cannon yet? Cause you probably can shoot it. You can.

1447
03:33:31,280 --> 03:33:34,479
I did not. Okay. Didn't know you could shoot the cannon. So what do you want to say?

1448
03:33:34,479 --> 03:33:43,809
I wasn't aware of that. Cannonball was already fired. I can't shoot it again.

1449
03:33:43,809 --> 03:34:06,639
How do you reload it? Okay. Let's do something with the cannon. Press insert. Oh, okay.

1450
03:34:06,639 --> 03:34:18,129
Let me turn on traffic. No, I don't want to play that again. No, no, no, no, no, no. Back,

1451
03:34:18,129 --> 03:34:26,590
back, back. What about fun stuff? Break, fire, hint. What is this? What's this for? Tires?

1452
03:34:26,590 --> 03:34:32,930
I just popped the tires. Okay. Well, that's annoying. All right. Let's spawn everybody.

1453
03:34:34,450 --> 03:34:41,840
See if we can have a little bit of fun. And then we're going to change a couple of things.

1454
03:34:41,840 --> 03:34:58,559
I want to do electrics. Yeah. All right. Shut up. All right. Let's shoot somebody with a cannon.

1455
03:35:05,620 --> 03:35:18,350
Holy shit. Oh, slow mo. Slow mo. I'm going to do super slow mo. This is going to be insane.

1456
03:35:18,350 --> 03:35:25,979
All right. Hold on. I want to put something here. I'm going to spawn something. I want to spawn

1457
03:35:25,979 --> 03:35:39,680
a car and I want to do 100 times slow mo. Let me one of these. Yeah. Just like a van. Okay.

1458
03:35:39,680 --> 03:35:45,250
And then I want to do a camera angle here. No, I want to be, wait, I want to get a good view.

1459
03:35:45,250 --> 03:36:16,350
This is going to be sick. Hey bro, check this out. Hey, you ready? I'm sure I'm facing the right

1460
03:36:16,350 --> 03:36:43,709
way. I'm not. I'm, this would have completely missed. This is it. You guys ready? Three, two,

1461
03:36:45,139 --> 03:37:32,899
one. Fire. Holy shit. Wait, reset. That was pretty crazy. What happened to my cannon? Oh,

1462
03:37:32,899 --> 03:37:47,219
that's not the cannon. Where's the cannon? Okay. Watch this. Ready? This is going to be weird.

1463
03:37:47,219 --> 03:39:45,840
Watch this one. Check this out. This is going to be crazy. Went under. I know it didn't. Wow.

1464
03:39:45,840 --> 03:39:56,020
That doesn't do way more damage. Insane. Oh, insane, man. Insane. It's going to go through

1465
03:39:56,020 --> 03:40:22,190
the windshield. All right. Reset. Dude. Insane. Hey, hey, quiet. It hit the engine block. Wait,

1466
03:40:22,190 --> 03:40:30,739
what if I do this? Will it come through the back door? Find out. God, here we go. Cool. This is a

1467
03:40:30,739 --> 03:40:48,340
cool experiment. Bat chest, bat chest, bat chest, bat chest. Why am I getting bat chested? This is

1468
03:40:48,340 --> 03:41:04,610
cool. That was really loud. I'm sorry. All right. Check this out. Here we go. This is going to be

1469
03:41:04,610 --> 03:41:57,739
crazy insane. This is going to be crazy insane. Here it comes. What? It went all the way through,

1470
03:41:57,739 --> 03:42:20,930
but it stopped. Guys, guys, it stopped. Guys, it stopped. It's kind of fun, actually. This is minor

1471
03:42:20,930 --> 03:42:27,149
damage. That's kind of minor. Yeah. It is like just minor damage to the, but they would explode.

1472
03:42:27,149 --> 03:43:04,059
Put on afic, Maria. Wait. Okay. Hold on. I want a different car. This one is too sturdy. Something

1473
03:43:04,059 --> 03:43:18,290
different. I mean, this is too sturdy. I'm just like, just like on one of these cars.

1474
03:43:18,290 --> 03:43:31,649
What's new Scooby Doo coming after you. It's stuck in my head. It's an ear. It's just in there.

1475
03:43:31,649 --> 03:44:22,110
Okay. Do you want to play Ave Maria? Hitman song. This one is the hitman song, right? All right. I

1476
03:44:22,110 --> 03:44:35,409
guess we're going to do this. Let's, let's go. Let me set it up. This is DMCA warning. You know

1477
03:44:35,409 --> 03:44:46,829
what? Let me tell you something. We used to do this thing on the channel where it was called

1478
03:44:46,829 --> 03:44:56,209
community content night. And I, I would have just tons of videos and tons of stuff people would make

1479
03:44:56,209 --> 03:45:00,690
that had a shitload of copyright material in it. Right. And eventually it got to the point where

1480
03:45:00,690 --> 03:45:04,770
it was like, wait a minute. No, don't do that because we've got to be careful of the Twitch

1481
03:45:04,770 --> 03:45:11,170
DMCA stuff. And it like kind of didn't really matter. I probably could have kept doing it.

1482
03:45:13,120 --> 03:45:20,290
It kind of sad because I kind of canned that two years ago or so. And it was this big scare about

1483
03:45:20,290 --> 03:45:28,819
DMCA. And I don't know. It seems like that wasn't that big of a problem. Um, in, you know,

1484
03:45:28,819 --> 03:45:38,450
2020 hindsight here, the Scooby Doo song probably already got claimed. Yeah. So like the VOD might

1485
03:45:38,450 --> 03:45:45,100
not be watchable. It'd be muted, which sucks, but I don't know. There was a big scare where it was

1486
03:45:45,100 --> 03:45:48,780
like your whole channel is going to get deleted. Everything, delete everything. They're going to,

1487
03:45:48,780 --> 03:45:53,729
they're coming. They're going to strike you. And this just didn't happen. Um, it happened. Maybe

1488
03:45:53,729 --> 03:45:58,719
it happened. Did it happen to anybody? And especially with all the stuff, weren't people

1489
03:45:58,719 --> 03:46:06,139
watching like television shows? I was terrified. There was a, there was one time there was a clip

1490
03:46:06,700 --> 03:46:13,739
where it was Star Wars. It was like six minutes of Star Wars with a bunch of me being put in place

1491
03:46:13,739 --> 03:46:19,979
of other characters. And I was so paranoid. I was sitting there going, I'm going to, this is bad.

1492
03:46:19,979 --> 03:46:25,389
I can't just, we're just watching Star Wars right now. We're just watching Star Wars. And, and then

1493
03:46:26,430 --> 03:46:33,780
I have people watching TV shows and I'm just sitting there going, I was so scared of having

1494
03:46:33,780 --> 03:46:40,479
a minute or two of Star Wars with a bunch of shit in it. So now I've, maybe I would bring it back.

1495
03:46:40,479 --> 03:46:47,760
I was terrified at the videos. Yeah. We'll probably, what we could probably do. Yeah. Some

1496
03:46:47,760 --> 03:46:55,010
people did get hit by some, yeah. Some streamers did get hit by DMCA. Yeah. But I feel like it

1497
03:46:55,010 --> 03:47:01,059
would be okay. I just thought they were coming down hard and that it was any copyright material

1498
03:47:01,059 --> 03:47:09,469
was going to get you just, just dunked on. But that wasn't the case at all. It's not as bad.

1499
03:47:09,469 --> 03:47:13,250
Nowadays. Yeah. I don't know. I was just like, okay, I guess we're going to try bring it back.

1500
03:47:14,750 --> 03:47:21,389
If I was going to bring it, I can't bring it back. I can't bring it back unless I go in front of the

1501
03:47:21,389 --> 03:47:29,219
screen again. That's how it works. I would only be able to bring it back if I did it again,

1502
03:47:29,219 --> 03:47:36,219
a third time, because then there would be even more. And that's when it'd be, all right, let's

1503
03:47:36,219 --> 03:47:40,700
go. I would do green screen night, green skin on a car, green screen. I think that would be fun.

1504
03:47:40,700 --> 03:47:46,079
We would basically have to say no music. And if it was gonna, if you're going to do something

1505
03:47:46,079 --> 03:47:52,000
copywritten, it would have to be enough would have to have been changed for it to be okay. Right.

1506
03:47:52,000 --> 03:47:55,709
But I remember when that happened, I remember sitting there going, this is bad. I got a can.

1507
03:47:55,709 --> 03:47:59,389
This is one of my favorite. That was one of my favorite things on the channel. My favorite things.

1508
03:48:00,530 --> 03:48:04,770
And we had to get rid of it because I was scared of DMCA. And then like I said,

1509
03:48:04,770 --> 03:48:11,200
a year or two later, it turns out of all the, everyone was so afraid that maybe that wasn't

1510
03:48:11,200 --> 03:48:17,149
such a big deal or who knows? I watch it. I will do that. I'll bring that back.

1511
03:48:17,709 --> 03:48:21,469
And there'll be a clip that gets me fucking destroyed. You know what I mean? It's just how

1512
03:48:21,469 --> 03:48:27,920
it's just hard to tell just how am I supposed to even know it's going to happen. So let's go

1513
03:48:27,920 --> 03:48:30,959
ahead and do this and get the channels fucking shut down forever.

1514
03:49:56,219 --> 03:50:28,059
Rim. Oh, that's funny. What's new Scooby Doo? That's funny. And he said that without a smile.

1515
03:50:28,059 --> 03:50:39,489
Actually that destroyed this car. Jeez. Can it still drive? This thing can still drive.

1516
03:50:51,780 --> 03:51:01,219
Ow. Shoot it again. I'll shoot it again. I'm going to shoot it right here.

1517
03:53:26,909 --> 03:54:01,170
Why are there so many fucking cars? Oh no.

1518
03:54:07,229 --> 03:54:16,209
Why did it stop? The music stopped. Who the fuck is this? Why did the music stop?

1519
03:54:17,809 --> 03:54:32,579
The music stopped. That was, I, what the, what, what happened? Uh, I actually like can't load

1520
03:54:32,579 --> 03:54:59,010
this video. Live DMCA. They had enough. Hold on. Who is beeping this horn? Who is doing this?

1521
03:55:04,129 --> 03:55:39,569
What's this guy's problem? You holding the horn down? This guy's a dick. What the hell?

1522
03:55:40,129 --> 03:55:57,280
Who the fuck is this? Who is this? What? Who is this? Why? Why did that person drive off the

1523
03:55:57,280 --> 03:56:09,459
clip? Why am I in this person's car? I can't control it. I can't control this person's car.

1524
03:56:10,819 --> 03:56:32,879
I can't. All right. I, I won. Okay. This is it. Last one. And I'm turning this off forever.

1525
03:56:32,879 --> 03:56:38,909
I'm going to have to AI chase the car. Chase me. Everybody. Let's go. Fucking who cares? This is

1526
03:56:38,909 --> 03:56:58,819
it. After that. Nope. Right now. What happened? No. Fuck you. Get me out of this. They're all here.

1527
03:56:58,819 --> 03:57:22,829
Somebody help. Help. Please help me. I can't fucking move. I have to respawn. Hold on. Hold on.

1528
03:57:24,430 --> 03:57:29,549
Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on everybody. Wait. Wait. Wait.

1529
03:57:29,549 --> 03:57:52,540
Wait. I'll fix it. I'll fix it. I'll fix it. Everybody come get me. Okay. Pause it. Pause it.

1530
03:57:52,540 --> 03:57:55,100
Pause it. Okay. You guys ready? This is it. This is it. This is literally it.

1531
03:57:57,440 --> 03:58:21,340
That's good. Right there. Like it's got to be bright. All right. Here we go.

1532
03:58:21,340 --> 03:58:31,520
Play the fucking song. I'm gonna. Oh my God. Here we go. This is it. I promise I'm not doing

1533
03:58:31,520 --> 03:59:04,540
this ever again. I have to restart. I have to restart. Here they come. They're coming after us.

1534
03:59:33,969 --> 03:59:55,100
No. I thought I got out. Who's the cameraman? You suck.

1535
03:59:57,979 --> 04:00:07,739
Stop. I need to just drive. Get away from me. What's happening? What happened? What?

1536
04:00:08,620 --> 04:00:21,840
Why did this happen? I don't even understand. Wait. There's another Scooby-Doo fan coming after us.

1537
04:00:24,110 --> 04:00:42,049
I need to respawn. Hold on. Give me a second. I can't even trust. I can't trust that Scooby-Doo truck.

1538
04:00:49,659 --> 04:01:18,930
No. No. No. No. No. I knew they were coming. I had to get off the road.

1539
04:01:19,649 --> 04:01:51,459
I can't anymore. It's time to turn it off. I have no control of the car.

1540
04:01:58,239 --> 04:02:05,379
This is so fucking horrible. This imagery is like not okay. This is not okay.

1541
04:02:06,020 --> 04:02:16,770
This imagery is like not cool. Oh no. The other mystery machine.

1542
04:02:17,569 --> 04:02:28,979
Are they gonna make it? I might get out. I think I'm gonna get out. I'm gonna get out.

1543
04:02:31,180 --> 04:02:38,930
I'm out. Hold on. Wait a minute. He's still coming.

1544
04:03:06,670 --> 04:03:13,219
I'm done. I'm done. Stream's over. I'm turning this off. I'm fucking out of here. I'm fucking out

1545
04:03:13,219 --> 04:03:26,350
of here. This is too much. I'm done. Imagine if the fucking Scooby-Doo intro was this long,

1546
04:03:26,350 --> 04:03:40,959
by the way. Why is this? Oh, it's 10 hour version. It's the 10 hour version. I can't even fucking

1547
04:03:40,959 --> 04:05:03,540
crawl. Oh no. How am I still driving? You missed. Oh no. Oh no. Oh no. This is bad.

1548
04:05:04,340 --> 04:05:45,170
This is bad. That's it. What a wacky adaptation. Helicopter shot.

1549
04:05:47,629 --> 04:05:59,600
That was playing for seven minutes. Oh, the imposter vans too. What a long intro. That's

1550
04:05:59,600 --> 04:06:16,670
the intro to what's new Scooby-Doo is them just getting crashed into. Oh Jesus. I have a fucking

1551
04:06:16,670 --> 04:06:35,139
headache. Oh my God. You know, I thought, I know that there's such a, I know it's gonna be a car

1552
04:06:35,139 --> 04:06:39,540
game and you're gonna crash your car and you're gonna laugh. I didn't think that was gonna happen.

1553
04:06:39,540 --> 04:06:44,979
I honestly, no, I'm not gonna fulfill the destiny of every stream. I'm not gonna laugh at the car

1554
04:06:44,979 --> 04:06:53,600
accident. I laughed until I had a headache. Put on the Breaking Bad theme. Okay, fine. You know what?

1555
04:06:53,600 --> 04:07:11,659
I have to. This is too funny. What's going on here? With the mystery mobile? God damn it. All right,

1556
04:07:11,659 --> 04:07:31,700
this is it. After this, I have to stop. My fucking head's gonna explode. Need to get an RV. God damn

1557
04:07:31,700 --> 04:07:37,729
it, man. All right, fine. Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine. I'll get an RV. I'll get an RV. And

1558
04:07:37,729 --> 04:08:07,700
this is it. No more after this. I'm done. What would it be under? Like this? What would it be under?

1559
04:08:07,700 --> 04:08:26,930
This thing? No. Travel trailer? Travel trailer. Oh, yep. God damn it, this is so stupid. This thing

1560
04:08:26,930 --> 04:09:00,930
can't drive. Can it? I can't drive this. I can't drive it. Oh, here we go, here we go, here we go.

1561
04:09:00,930 --> 04:09:22,579
I'm going, I'm going, I'm going, I'm going. I'm going, I'm going, I'm going. It's not gonna work.

1562
04:09:23,139 --> 04:09:35,979
This is not gonna work. I'm done. I have to put a truck on it. I think this one will work.

1563
04:09:35,979 --> 04:09:57,200
This is fine. Just pretend this is an RV. Yeah, like this one. Just use the van. That's a bus.

1564
04:09:57,200 --> 04:10:17,819
We need to go somewhere else too. Long jump cliff? Oh, this is GPS. I don't know how to do that.

1565
04:10:22,899 --> 04:10:40,610
Okay, it was Utah. Where the hell is Utah? Now we want to go to airfield. We gotta go way out there.

1566
04:10:40,610 --> 04:10:49,700
Yeah, we're going to the airfield. Put a yellow filter on. Okay, and you know what I'm gonna do.

1567
04:11:02,879 --> 04:11:15,629
Hold on. Well, we'll set this up right. We just had a moment. Okay, yeah, the guy,

1568
04:11:15,629 --> 04:11:21,069
the Geico Gecko is a real person. Yeah, look, he's a real guy. Geico, he's a, he's a real,

1569
04:11:21,069 --> 04:11:25,229
look, oh, he's behind the scenes. He's a real guy. He's a real person talking into the camera.

1570
04:11:25,229 --> 04:11:45,500
Okay, cool. It's me, but no one's looking for you. Okay, hold on. Okay, what was the right one you

1571
04:11:45,500 --> 04:11:56,959
set up was? The left. Jesse. This one here. And what's the best one? Probably this one here,

1572
04:11:56,959 --> 04:12:26,940
right? Is there a better one? The one below it? I wish, I wish I could, wait, hold on.

1573
04:12:26,940 --> 04:12:41,549
The one that was next to it? This one here. Okay, so what color should I make it? Is that all right?

1574
04:12:41,549 --> 04:12:57,520
The Vanster? What color? The default or this one? This brown color, right? Let me put a filter on

1575
04:12:57,520 --> 04:13:43,340
this too, like an orange filter, right? I need yellow. Kind of hard to do. The hue shift is,

1576
04:13:43,340 --> 04:13:55,889
like, gonna be really weird looking. I think that's okay. Unless I, can I add? I'm not sure

1577
04:13:55,889 --> 04:14:10,219
there's any filter I can add to this to make it, oh, hold on, there we go. Okay, color corrector.

1578
04:14:10,219 --> 04:14:18,239
Yeah, it's gonna be hard to do. Make a transparent layer. How does this look in the actual game?

1579
04:14:18,239 --> 04:14:28,659
I mean, that's, I don't know, that's pretty close. That could be it. That's not that bad.

1580
04:14:28,659 --> 04:14:56,129
Up to saturation? This just looks like an iPad game. It looks like a cartoon. Hold on,

1581
04:14:56,129 --> 04:15:23,309
it's getting better. Better? Fortnite map. It does look like a Fortnite. All right, that's good.

1582
04:15:23,309 --> 04:15:50,899
Okay, here we go. Less red and less blue. Guys, I can't do color correction on this. It doesn't

1583
04:15:50,899 --> 04:15:59,020
like it. It doesn't want me to. Wait, hold on. Um, be careful. This might hurt your eyes. I would

1584
04:15:59,020 --> 04:16:08,719
say just, just maybe, hold on, let me make sure it doesn't, it's gonna be bad. Um, this actually

1585
04:16:08,719 --> 04:16:33,200
might be like annoying to look at, so just be aware of that. I'm serious. All right, that's

1586
04:16:33,200 --> 04:17:06,659
looking pretty close. More yellow? Okay, that's definitely it. That's 100% right. Okay, here you

1587
04:17:06,659 --> 04:17:23,379
go. You ready? It's time for the latest episode of Breaking Bad. It's me. Oh, shit. What am I,

1588
04:17:23,379 --> 04:17:40,209
stupid?

1589
04:17:45,010 --> 04:17:57,629
Fuck. Spawn cops. Okay, hold on.

1590
04:18:20,700 --> 04:18:24,860
If you're planning on giving me some bullwinder about getting right with Jesus

1591
04:18:25,500 --> 04:18:28,780
or turning myself in. Not really. High school was a long time ago.

1592
04:18:29,500 --> 04:18:37,469
Yeah, you ain't welcome back cars. Step off. No speeches. Short speech. You lost your partner

1593
04:18:37,469 --> 04:18:45,020
today. Where are the police? Emilio? Where are the police? Where are the police? What was that?

1594
04:18:45,020 --> 04:18:55,329
Where are the police? I spawned them. They don't fucking exist. Hold on. Where are the police?

1595
04:18:55,809 --> 04:19:09,260
All right, I'm gonna turn traffic off. This is the last thing I'm doing before I'm out of here.

1596
04:19:09,260 --> 04:19:24,270
Okay, AI. Traffic. Remove traffic. I'm gonna stay on the road. Okay, traffic is off. Spawn police.

1597
04:19:24,270 --> 04:19:34,079
And then chase me, right? Oh my god, that's a lot. What the fuck? That's so many. Okay, now

1598
04:19:34,719 --> 04:19:38,350
come get me. You guys ready? Here we go. Here it comes. Here it is.

1599
04:20:00,860 --> 04:20:13,100
Square one, but you know the business and I know the chemistry. I'm thinking

1600
04:20:14,750 --> 04:20:43,649
maybe you and I could partner up on a good crystal mat. You, you and uh and me. Either that

1601
04:20:45,180 --> 04:21:03,180
or I turn you in. This is fucking stupid. This is fucking dumb, man. This is dumb.

1602
04:21:03,819 --> 04:21:20,979
This wasn't even close to being as funny as the other one. Mr. White. I was trying to just go off

1603
04:21:20,979 --> 04:21:27,840
a cliff. I was trying just to drive off a cliff. I was just peddled to the mat. All right, I'm done.

1604
04:21:28,479 --> 04:21:34,780
Turn all these filters off. This looks like shit. Please don't sue me and don't fucking remove my

1605
04:21:34,780 --> 04:21:41,899
stream. Turn this off before I hurt anybody else's eyes. They come to watch the stream. Look at how

1606
04:21:41,899 --> 04:21:49,010
much nicer that looks. All right, I'm gonna go. I'm gonna go. My head hurts. My fucking brain hurts.

1607
04:21:49,889 --> 04:21:59,180
This is so loud. Well, that was really funny. I successfully evaded the police. Okay, well that's

1608
04:21:59,180 --> 04:22:09,260
good to know. Throw out the car. All right, I will see you guys. Um, what's today? Maybe tomorrow?

1609
04:22:09,260 --> 04:22:15,329
Yeah, I'll be- tomorrow's Wednesday. Let's go. Something's happening tomorrow. I thought, wait,

1610
04:22:15,329 --> 04:22:23,600
what's happening tomorrow? Something is happening tomorrow and I don't know what it is. Okay, well,

1611
04:22:23,600 --> 04:22:27,579
I don't know what it is but we're gonna do it on Thursday. I'll see you guys on Thursday. We're

1612
04:22:27,579 --> 04:22:38,049
gonna do, uh, what was it gonna be? What the hell was- what the hell was it gonna stream?

1613
04:22:40,190 --> 04:22:45,409
Oh, the new house flipper update. House flipper pets DLC came out. It looks actually really good.

1614
04:22:45,409 --> 04:22:52,420
We're gonna do house flipper pets on, um, Thursday and then this weekend, probably on

1615
04:22:53,629 --> 04:23:00,110
Saturday or Sunday, we'll do some horror stuff. So we'll- yeah, we'll go- do Tuesday, we'll do

1616
04:23:00,110 --> 04:23:08,180
Thursday, we'll do Saturday. Maybe Saturday, Sunday? These people are still trying to kill me. Thanks

1617
04:23:08,180 --> 04:23:12,260
for watching, as always, everybody. Let me just say goodbye to you properly, right? Thanks for

1618
04:23:12,260 --> 04:23:19,180
watching. That was really funny. Um, my brain just hurts so I- I gotta get out of here. I'll see you

1619
04:23:19,180 --> 04:23:26,659
on Thursday. House flipper pets and then we got murder house and blood wash to play. I might be

1620
04:23:26,659 --> 04:23:31,950
able to even do another one. That was probably only like an hour long. I'll see you soon. That

1621
04:23:31,950 --> 04:23:37,649
was a ton of fun. That was- this game's great. I- I've seen this game played a million times

1622
04:23:37,649 --> 04:23:45,819
but I just never bought it so here it is. Really good BeamNG. That's fantastic. So I'll see you

1623
04:23:45,819 --> 04:23:49,420
guys later. See you Thursday. Thanks for watching. Good night. Goodbye. Take care of yourselves.

1624
04:23:49,420 --> 04:24:05,090
Love you, mother. You know. See you soon. The stream was fucked up. Yeah, it was, wasn't it? But

1625
04:24:05,090 --> 04:24:10,579
I don't know. I think I had a lot of fun. I gotta exit the game. How do I get out of here?

1626
04:24:10,579 --> 04:24:21,379
I'm actually looking forward to the house flipper update. There's actually- there's tons of animals.

1627
04:24:21,379 --> 04:24:28,500
It's not just dogs and cats. I think there are birds, bunnies, gerbils. There's a ton of stuff.

1628
04:24:28,500 --> 04:24:44,620
I'm gonna have an entire huge pet family. There are turtles. What about Webbed? Webbed is just

1629
04:24:44,620 --> 04:24:51,739
gonna be one of those games that I sit in the back pocket or whenever I decide to play it. I promise

1630
04:24:51,739 --> 04:25:02,159
I am gonna play it at some point. Within the next 30 days. Or within the next two weeks. Is Webbed

1631
04:25:02,159 --> 04:25:08,430
gonna be the new Glover? Um, no I mean I played Glover. Everybody hated it. Everybody screamed at

1632
04:25:08,430 --> 04:25:24,719
me and told me to leave. Promises equal lies. I'm just a very excitable person so I will say

1633
04:25:24,719 --> 04:25:30,030
something that I really want to do. Like oh yeah that sounds amazing. That sounds like an incredible

1634
04:25:30,030 --> 04:25:34,899
idea. Then two or three weeks later when you go hey uh remember when you said that you said you

1635
04:25:34,899 --> 04:25:43,579
promised you were gonna play it. Oh oops. Bring back community content night. Like I said before

1636
04:25:43,579 --> 04:25:47,260
if I'm gonna bring back community content night I'm gonna want to do another batch of green screen

1637
04:25:47,260 --> 04:25:55,489
stuff. That's where it's the most fun for me. So that's when you'll know. If you hear me announce

1638
04:25:55,489 --> 04:26:07,620
in the next few weeks I'm going back in front of the screen. Then we'll do more. What about Bionicle?

1639
04:26:08,260 --> 04:26:16,049
I don't have the rights to stream Bionicle. I don't think I can get them. Public domain movies?

1640
04:26:16,129 --> 04:26:35,440
Yeah I still want to do that too. How about retrying Halo? Yeah I'm just not a Halo guy.

1641
04:26:35,440 --> 04:26:45,969
It's cool. What about the Switch sports game? That did come out. Yeah there's a lot of stuff.

1642
04:26:46,850 --> 04:26:58,180
There's a lot of stuff to play so we can put it in the backlog. All right guys I'll see you later.

1643
04:26:58,180 --> 04:27:02,420
See you Thursday. Thanks for watching. Good night. Goodbye. See you soon.
