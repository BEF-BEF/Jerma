1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,520
Wait, talk. I don't think people can hear you.

2
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:05,379
Oh shit, talk. I don't think people can hear you.

3
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:16,019
And I have one of those too. Oh shit. I don't think people can hear you. Oh shit. I don't think I can do that too. Oh shit. I don't think people hear you.

4
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:19,039
It didn't do anything.

5
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:26,920
No, I didn't miss it. I didn't. I'm here. We're here. I know you're here. I'm just, you know, I just, this was my big break.

6
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,920
Xbox and

7
00:00:29,239 --> 00:00:32,399
All right, look hold on I got I got how do I turn this down?

8
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:37,399
Both of them so much individually and I'm really curious to see what that I'm here

9
00:00:38,359 --> 00:00:41,280
They and how different it might be from pretty much in the wrong place

10
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:49,640
60 seconds see you don't ever go to the movie with the previews are on

11
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:55,000
Well, I really need to see the Gemini man trailer like ten more times. I've already seen it

12
00:00:55,679 --> 00:01:02,100
This is the same amount of time when we travel together like how much time was left in boarding

13
00:01:03,159 --> 00:01:05,159
Yeah, you get right on the plane

14
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:08,810
You get right on the plane

15
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:15,689
Get to the terminal fucking like two hours early. No you get right on the plane

16
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:18,810
Yeah, but what about?

17
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:21,129
Hillary's email

18
00:01:21,129 --> 00:01:27,150
What about the people that don't know that you were gonna stream and come in late and then okay on my stream

19
00:01:28,489 --> 00:01:34,329
We've got a no chatter left behind policy and if you don't start early you're leaving people behind who didn't know

20
00:01:34,329 --> 00:01:50,329
No, they were here. No early

21
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:56,530
What do you know? How do I do it? What's fun? I'm gonna talk during the cut

22
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:59,769
I have to meet I have to be able to deafen you during the big reveal of Elden Ring

23
00:01:59,769 --> 00:02:04,090
Okay. Well, you've got you've got 60 seconds to figure out how to do it. All right, let me figure it out

24
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:06,090
I have to tweet that I'm here. I

25
00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:11,409
Got a tweet. I can tweet my mother that like we're about to get on the plane. Okay. Yeah, I

26
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:14,620
Got a I got a story for you, by the way

27
00:02:15,659 --> 00:02:20,580
Just I don't know why I was late. I have a lot that I wanted to talk to you about but I don't really have the time

28
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:24,500
We got the after show. That's what that's for. We sit and we talk about our what our thoughts were

29
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:32,780
Yeah

30
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:36,580
Well, not dead silent you can like coffins they make like old man noises

31
00:02:40,099 --> 00:02:42,099
Seats on the plane

32
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:50,439
Anyways, hi guys. Welcome to e3 shows gonna begin at 55 seconds

33
00:02:55,699 --> 00:02:58,080
Yeah, I got to turn you up this down

34
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:10,379
Yeah, what do you guys want to hear more?

35
00:03:10,659 --> 00:03:19,360
What if I did it? Okay. All right. I got it. What do you guys want to hear more me and stars hood?

36
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,860
Larry is banter. We're like I want to hear they want to hear

37
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:28,699
What is the future of gaming with more ways to play than ever before?

38
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:34,939
We're finally bringing to the home console. Yeah, my dream is generation. Why is my true? Oh fuck. Hold on

39
00:03:34,939 --> 00:03:38,259
I'm gonna disconnect for like five seconds. I'm lagging. There we go

40
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:45,259
Sorry, I was running. I'm good. I'm good. We're good. Good. Welcome to the e3 conference. I'm here. I'm here. I'm good

41
00:03:45,259 --> 00:03:48,009
I'm good. I'm good. I'm good. Okay

42
00:03:48,169 --> 00:03:54,090
Now if you could follow your own advice and please the movie is starting I want some complete silence. All right

43
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:59,689
All right. All right. I'm good. I'm good. We're old depth of the trailers. They've worked a long time on creating

44
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:08,189
Yeah, I can turn this up. What did you want to talk about? I don't have time

45
00:04:08,189 --> 00:04:11,550
There's there is not enough time to get into it. It's like a whole

46
00:04:13,069 --> 00:04:17,769
Shit on the screen get this off the screen. How do I turn this off? How do I get this off?

47
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:24,990
20 years you click on on the right side. There's a there's a twitch gaming pop-out and like you click on that

48
00:04:26,389 --> 00:04:28,389
That's a not visible

49
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:31,910
All right

50
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:40,290
Watch this guy talking everyone around will come together and celebrate what games mean to all of us

51
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:44,089
But you don't know how to mute me so I'm self-conscious now fuck they've meant even more all right

52
00:04:44,089 --> 00:04:49,170
Stop Todd's talking for being with us today. Thank you for the support. You give us and one another

53
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:54,920
He thinks we're friends 20 and I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for the friendships

54
00:04:54,920 --> 00:05:01,600
We've had that whole time at Bethesda. We believe video games do one thing better than anything else

55
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:04,600
They transport us through art and technology

56
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:09,680
There's real magic when you step into a new world and can make it your own

57
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:18,000
We've traveled the worlds of Elder Scrolls of fallout and now for the first time in over 25 years

58
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,600
We're creating a new universe

59
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:26,680
With starfield oh we already knew that hundreds of years in our future. It's a new that did you know that about hope?

60
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:31,160
Your humanity and yeah, I'm greatest mystery

61
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,779
It's a game we've dreamt of playing and it wasn't till now

62
00:05:35,779 --> 00:05:41,060
Where the technology and the team who's hard it was your first time don't worry about it make that dream a reality

63
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:48,060
We're excited to finally share our first in-game teaser and something was in game all right

64
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:53,540
I'm on my phone. Are you what I was just like

65
00:05:54,579 --> 00:06:01,079
Attention all right quiet. I did that during Elden ring. I didn't even realize it was on screen

66
00:06:01,079 --> 00:06:20,189
I just talked over it stop dude am I the guy that has to tell his own friend to shut the fuck up at the movie

67
00:06:20,509 --> 00:06:24,029
No one's there where I'm talking about. He's walking. He's climbing a ladder

68
00:06:24,029 --> 00:06:27,230
Can you visually see this or do you need your ears to hear the ladder clank?

69
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:34,230
You may as well just be smoking a cigarette next to me like get the put that shit out. They say okay the wonder is

70
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:37,589
Not that the field of stars is so vast

71
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:40,470
But that we have measured it

72
00:06:40,589 --> 00:06:45,439
You're part of constellation now part of our family

73
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:48,519
What you found?

74
00:06:48,519 --> 00:06:50,759
It's the key to unlocking

75
00:06:51,759 --> 00:07:00,300
Everything this is all we've been working towards

76
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:07,980
I have so many drinks. I don't know which one my drink. We've come to the beginning of humanity. Excuse me

77
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:28,199
To discover what's out there

78
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:30,199
Yeah

79
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:42,100
Yeah, no gameplay no by can I tell you I'm sick. I'm sick of the space shit

80
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:45,300
Space shit, and we saw this movie already

81
00:07:46,139 --> 00:07:50,910
Space shit is the new zombie shit. It's the new I don't I don't care for space stuff anymore

82
00:07:51,589 --> 00:08:00,579
Okay, so um I mean there's this gigantic vast universe, and you just don't want anything to take place in it

83
00:08:00,579 --> 00:08:05,839
But I it's just like I'm sad honest. I'm sick of seeing the guy the astronaut helmet on I've seen it a thousand times

84
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:10,730
Water I don't I'm sick of seeing

85
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:24,230
I did imagine a movie that like every every like five to ten minutes. It's stopped

86
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:33,230
You get to discuss what you just watch

87
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:36,070
Well, yeah, I mean how many buzzwords

88
00:08:37,429 --> 00:08:39,429
Somebody

89
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:48,159
We are committed to forging the next getting Komodo hype right now, what is that?

90
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:53,679
It's only 50% that's not

91
00:08:54,879 --> 00:09:00,679
50% you guys you gotta spam it gamers rise up not here. Do you spend it in this?

92
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:03,919
Is the main chat

93
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:10,399
If you do it in there it counts it's all twitch does not count so today of course they count

94
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,840
This looks bad. We can't even get it to 50% show 30 tight. Yeah, you got to amp it up

95
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:24,759
If it gets to the top every single they cancel Starfield today is optimized for Xbox series X and S

96
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:29,019
This is weird to have this on the screen and features

97
00:09:31,159 --> 00:09:33,519
This is I don't know why this should not be on

98
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:40,980
This is the equivalent of us saying do we just talk over her like they're trying to put something on the screen to entertain you

99
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:44,159
Well, she just like does like the Naruto filler

100
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:49,720
Like oh, this is the last like five years of games. We've released. We're gonna tell you that we did this and

101
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:55,419
You you guys just like play with this toy. We give you for a second, but it's filled. So what happens?

102
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:01,279
What if she looked over to the left of the screen and was like, oh the height meter filled

103
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:05,559
That's what I put on the funny hat and like it's like a hat comes down she puts it on

104
00:10:05,879 --> 00:10:11,639
Well logically that can't happen because this is streaming on multiple platforms and only twitch has the meter. Oh shit

105
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:13,639
This is actually a gameplay. Oh

106
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:15,679
you know what I mean, I

107
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:18,159
Thought this was light

108
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,600
It looks so real

109
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,779
Your place talker got to

110
00:10:27,019 --> 00:10:30,940
We can do it movie theater style, hey, dude, did you play stalker?

111
00:10:31,899 --> 00:10:36,379
I tried to like a long time ago and I I didn't have a good computer and it just crashed so I gave up

112
00:10:36,379 --> 00:10:38,379
Yeah, yeah, who is that? Who is that?

113
00:10:40,299 --> 00:10:45,740
John stalker I what I was in the bathroom. What's that guy do?

114
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:55,919
Character from Metro. Okay. Hey, it's your fucking seat. I got sticky

115
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,639
Sorry, sorry the movie's too loud

116
00:11:21,019 --> 00:11:34,100
This really looks like Metro this game's kind of fun it really was I've heard a lot of good things

117
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:41,460
I think you would actually like this game. I think I would too

118
00:11:41,899 --> 00:11:43,899
I mean like the whole series

119
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:04,740
That is you talking I don't know why for some reason

120
00:12:42,379 --> 00:12:47,659
I was looking down at my water and I looked up and I thought that the model he was dancing with did not load in

121
00:12:47,659 --> 00:12:49,659
And they were freaking out behind the scenes

122
00:13:21,139 --> 00:13:23,139
Donald Waller

123
00:13:38,259 --> 00:13:40,940
Mutual sir actually looks kind of look a bit pretty good. Yeah

124
00:13:41,899 --> 00:13:43,580
That's a hush. Oh

125
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:48,440
One of them is a sushi. Um, I just want to let you know

126
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:55,600
Can everyone listening know that I've decided so that we can have a totally neutral and our biased review of e3

127
00:13:58,039 --> 00:14:00,600
You're gonna disagree with me on everything. Yeah

128
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,919
This game looks like garbage

129
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:08,460
It was a typically a slower pace to tactical game and they've got people running around

130
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:22,159
It's like you German what

131
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:38,820
Understand you you get into these like

132
00:14:40,659 --> 00:14:42,659
People get it

133
00:14:42,659 --> 00:14:44,659
Oh wait, you know

134
00:14:48,659 --> 00:14:53,769
Roll the tape back

135
00:14:53,769 --> 00:14:55,570
streamer reveal I

136
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:58,379
Gotta tell you what I did today

137
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:03,899
You gotta just why you were late. Yes, and it's fucking horrible. Listen to me. This is important

138
00:15:03,899 --> 00:15:07,340
I wish I could pause e3, you know, I mean we got like we got stuff to talk about the movie

139
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:11,019
So I was in a rush and I fuck this more

140
00:15:11,659 --> 00:15:14,779
It's just left for dead again. We've all played it before

141
00:15:15,179 --> 00:15:20,899
Okay, we've seen this we all already know that dead deep rock galactic is a better game move on

142
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:25,799
so before I got here, I just got a new deodorant, right and

143
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:30,000
I grabbed it and but without even thinking I

144
00:15:30,519 --> 00:15:35,279
Just brand new I took the top off the deodorant because I was in a rush got out of the showers

145
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:38,600
like I gotta get fucking get there gotta get to the movie, right and I ripped the top off and went

146
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:42,639
And scrape with the plastic shit still on it

147
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:48,820
Plastic nub on it and I caused like damage to the underarm here. It was like gotta go gotta go

148
00:15:50,919 --> 00:15:52,919
It was horrible I have like a cup there

149
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:57,799
Took me like five minutes to figure out what I was gonna do. Okay, I took you five minutes

150
00:15:57,799 --> 00:15:59,799
And that's why you were 30 minutes late

151
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:04,970
Well, I cut my underarm it hurt a lot

152
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:09,970
It was awful. It hurt a shit load

153
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:17,279
All right, what are you doing that?

154
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:22,940
What do I think what I said? I think that

155
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:29,620
Everyone has wanted a left for dead sequel for like 10 years and no one made it and now that they've made it

156
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:34,419
it's outdated and other people have done it better and you could really try deep rock galactic if you haven't or

157
00:16:36,259 --> 00:16:38,259
Personal favorite of EDF

158
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:44,220
No one gives EDF a chance, but they're all gonna play left for dead again

159
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:52,129
EDF was fun, but EDF I think that people just don't know what to do about multiplayer anymore

160
00:16:52,649 --> 00:16:57,370
It's just like I guess four of you have guns and shoot it people running at you

161
00:16:57,370 --> 00:17:03,129
I would not evolved from like the grab three of your buddies and shoot at people sprinting at you

162
00:17:03,129 --> 00:17:05,299
I don't know. How how do we do that?

163
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:13,380
Do you like this is what I brought up last time last time they showed the e3 for the first time and you know

164
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:18,740
Everyone big disarray cuz you got I'm a hard person to agree with. How do you feel about reloading guns?

165
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:23,839
Personally, where you stand on this? I think it gives a pause for you to have to stretch each other

166
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:27,799
Make sure that you can it's it's a risk and reward

167
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:33,119
Okay, so this is why we're good because we're neutrally balanced that I'm gonna disagree with you on everything

168
00:17:34,079 --> 00:17:38,140
Well, we got all these zombies running towards you who wants to stop shooting them

169
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:41,799
That's why doom was so good and everyone loved doom because you can just jump around and keep shooting them

170
00:17:41,859 --> 00:17:47,940
What is the reload animations and these left-for-dead games are like, okay, shoot you shoot for a second reload for four

171
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:51,140
Thanks kid. Can you two shut the fuck up back there?

172
00:17:55,220 --> 00:18:02,480
Talking the whole movie next question. Do you think DMCA is real or made up? I think DMCA is made up

173
00:18:03,099 --> 00:18:04,180
Yeah

174
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:08,039
No, I don't well then explain this how come

175
00:18:08,619 --> 00:18:14,579
No streamers have been banned. I don't know because everyone freaked out

176
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:19,099
they mute your stream if you have like a portion of this they will mute it and

177
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:23,420
Now everyone's saying that I don't know. Why are you fucking up my whole worldview?

178
00:18:24,259 --> 00:18:25,789
Well

179
00:18:25,789 --> 00:18:29,230
You're listening to this popular song on your stream right now. Nothing's gonna happen, right?

180
00:18:29,789 --> 00:18:32,549
Well, they have they have like they've suspended people

181
00:18:33,349 --> 00:18:40,089
Who name a big streamer? They've suspended. I don't know. Don't pay attention. Fuck. I'm this is I'm terrible at these

182
00:18:41,009 --> 00:18:45,829
Okay, how did you hear about DMCA claims being an issue?

183
00:18:46,349 --> 00:18:54,839
Um, it's all like a reddit thread that said hey like they're kind of cracking down and then like twitch came out

184
00:18:54,839 --> 00:19:00,720
Didn't twitch come on with thing that said that like that like hey, we're like DMC cracking down who told me that

185
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:13,819
I swear no, no, dude. I DMCA is but my youtube channel has been fucking strike before but not strike

186
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:17,380
But like shit has been what does it have to do with your twitch stream? They mute it

187
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:23,180
They mute it if they hold forces of odd. Are you here's the real question? Are you afraid of DMCA?

188
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:27,859
I am not afraid of DMCA. I am afraid of having my

189
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:33,960
Magical voice muted during a goddamn live stream while I'm talking and listening to music

190
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:40,099
Well, it doesn't happen while you're talking. Yes. It does if this music in the background mutes like 12 minutes of your stream

191
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:47,220
Yeah, and your VOD which isn't while you're talking. No one watches the VOD. They might do that shit. You never know who knows

192
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:52,859
Yeah, but on OBS now you can have your VOD save with a different track than the ones that you streamed with

193
00:19:53,539 --> 00:19:58,319
Stop talking. Stop talking. This is very important. That was just Johnny Depp dude. Okay, it is. Okay, you're right

194
00:19:58,319 --> 00:20:03,440
Actually, this is Johnny Depp. Do you remember the first time they showed Sea of Thieves at E3 and we were both like

195
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,279
This is the fucking game. This is the game changer

196
00:20:09,099 --> 00:20:13,640
Trying to watch okay, I guess I'm trying to member over here

197
00:20:29,799 --> 00:20:33,599
Oh, yes, and now one Davey Jones, I

198
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:44,460
Believe that now is the perfect time to use these cannons

199
00:20:46,019 --> 00:20:48,450
This is perfect

200
00:20:57,309 --> 00:21:04,750
I've never seen a Pirates of the Caribbean movie. Well, but the reason why this is perfect because the latest Johnny Depp

201
00:21:05,029 --> 00:21:10,390
Jack Sparrow shit is like Johnny Depp pretending to be Jack Sparrow. It's it's kind of gotten that far

202
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:20,069
So now like he's CG so they're even pretending that the actor is a real person too. So if you see the first day where

203
00:21:21,009 --> 00:21:24,869
What's his name? Jeff Goldblum came on to announce Jurassic Park

204
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:29,349
No, it's worth going back to watch

205
00:21:29,349 --> 00:21:34,970
I swear he came back and did a parody of himself to make fun of everyone who wanted him to do it

206
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:48,240
It was really great. All right. Wait, what's um, all right Johnny Depp now available

207
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,799
Yeah, should I get Xbox game pass? I feel like it's gonna be worth it at some point soon

208
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:54,980
Do you have a computer?

209
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:57,859
Yeah, but that's oh

210
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:02,460
Okay, do you have I don't know tens of thousands of viewers

211
00:22:04,819 --> 00:22:10,279
Is your purchasing of games that deductible in taxes

212
00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:14,680
I'm times. Yeah, I don't think game pass is really gonna help

213
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:22,400
Okay, here's the real final question, I'm sorry last one

214
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:29,089
Are you going to play a game made later than 1980? Oh, this is people in like diapers on the screen

215
00:22:30,569 --> 00:22:37,809
What you kusa is this and why have I not played it yet? I want to play this you you would actually love them

216
00:22:37,809 --> 00:22:39,809
Yeah, I played because zero

217
00:22:40,529 --> 00:22:52,190
I don't know. Why did some why everyone want me to play the first one zero? Why wouldn't I play that one free alpha gameplay?

218
00:23:00,089 --> 00:23:05,309
Are you sick of the yeah, what do you think it's cool?

219
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:13,799
I'm a huge fan of the in. Um, what was the name of that movie?

220
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,279
district 9

221
00:23:16,279 --> 00:23:18,500
That was a really good

222
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:25,980
But like cinematic trailer, huh? No. Yeah, I think I think I'm kind of over it. I'm actually kind of let's let's watch

223
00:23:26,599 --> 00:23:58,500
I'll come on. Oh, hi

224
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:03,049
Let's get the buck chance to the chat. Oh

225
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:07,049
It's actually it's on the screen. Why are they doing this?

226
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:12,660
And it's like ruining the trailer for everybody that wants to do not listen to two dickheads talk over it

227
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:19,480
Yeah, let's see some pot. It's like hey, I'm watching this

228
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:45,750
I have a confession to make after this trail is over to about how I play battlefield whenever I played it

229
00:24:46,349 --> 00:24:54,049
Okay, I've never killed one person in one game of battlefield. I don't think once

230
00:24:54,789 --> 00:24:59,519
Once no, I just kind of walk around and shoot the like weapon at stuff in the air

231
00:25:00,039 --> 00:25:03,720
Like my assault rifle and stuff at planes and stuff and I pretend like I'm playing

232
00:25:04,319 --> 00:25:09,480
And I just revive people and then I don't ever play the game again. And like I don't and then people stop inviting me to play

233
00:25:15,779 --> 00:25:17,799
I

234
00:25:17,799 --> 00:25:22,680
Mine is actually a little bit similar is I find like a really tall hill and I lay on top of the hill

235
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:25,839
And I just kind of watch the battle

236
00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:31,559
And every one minute I take a shot and like pretend I'm like sniping and like I feel cool

237
00:25:31,559 --> 00:25:37,720
I don't hit anybody though. So I'm saying I have not killed anyone. So you play battlefield as an idle game

238
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:42,839
Well, yeah, like me and my friends we do a full squad and all four of us are on different hills

239
00:25:43,119 --> 00:25:49,799
Just looking for other people on hills, but nobody really ever gets a shot in also. Are we still in the previews?

240
00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:57,109
What these are these are games I know but like has this field come on talk yet

241
00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:01,170
Todd was out talking

242
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:09,240
Well, this is not even Xbox this is Bethesda

243
00:26:10,759 --> 00:26:16,799
Co a group thing. I see I seen this a lot too, but back at you

244
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:35,960
Yeah, but I feel like a lot

245
00:26:37,009 --> 00:26:39,369
This is what I worry about, you know last day

246
00:26:40,009 --> 00:26:44,490
You're like, hey, let's watch on the last day. You've already seen all these already. I haven't seen anything

247
00:26:45,089 --> 00:26:50,819
I'm waiting for Elgin, right? You have you have not heard that like Psychonauts 2 is a thing. Well, yeah, but I'm

248
00:26:51,619 --> 00:26:53,819
But it's closer to being released

249
00:26:54,500 --> 00:27:05,430
There's three or four new clips in here

250
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:29,009
It's like it's actually fun, you know, I asked this question every single time this trailer shows

251
00:27:29,849 --> 00:27:32,599
Have you ever played it nope

252
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,200
probably more fun than like

253
00:27:41,599 --> 00:27:43,599
cleaning a dirty fence I

254
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:49,319
Don't know about that going to this game might have too many buttons for you

255
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:52,319
You think so? Yeah

256
00:27:52,359 --> 00:28:05,809
We're getting just bang bang, but reveal reveal reveal

257
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:14,880
This is usually the moment when I say hello and welcome to the Bethesda e3 showcase

258
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:21,440
We love that we can share this you're not gonna do the Xbox this year and whether you've known Bethesda for 35 years or are just

259
00:28:22,319 --> 00:28:24,319
35

260
00:28:25,319 --> 00:28:27,319
35 what?

261
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:40,240
That's when you like pat me on the back and you're like good good job Jeremy. Yep. That's how old you are

262
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:48,819
I don't know how old you are. I don't know why we're talking what and today bringing ten more titles to game pass for a total of

263
00:28:49,779 --> 00:28:55,140
You know how old you are Jeremy you're three yes, I'm free like the award-winning doom eternal

264
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:59,680
If you're looking for another reason to play it doom maternal will be optimized if you play doom

265
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:08,279
That's why you think the reloading is essential this next-gen upgrade will be not every single game has to have no reloads

266
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:18,720
Because then every game becomes like the zombie game every game becomes the the two choices that you have to make at oh

267
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:23,980
Which one who lives and who dies right that everybody? I don't want to do that. I want everything to be different

268
00:29:27,349 --> 00:29:29,529
You were just complaining about every game is the same game

269
00:29:30,150 --> 00:29:35,569
When was I complaining about that you said what it was the very beginning exploring every beginning this frame you said

270
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:40,150
No, I said it and then you agreed. I said man. Oh, what's with all these that left for dead clones, right?

271
00:29:40,150 --> 00:29:44,470
It's a you show four people you said they shoot zombies. No what I said

272
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:51,029
Was that there's a better version of Left 4 Dead and you should just play the best version of each genre and that is deep

273
00:29:51,029 --> 00:29:56,289
Rock galactic, and it's not even debatable everyone who plays this game knows this this is just true

274
00:29:56,289 --> 00:30:01,190
I forgot our whole conversation already. I have to be honest. I'm just I'm just winging it here

275
00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:06,920
All right, what is this?

276
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:19,099
Do you think they're ever gonna Diablo 3 this game and they'll come out with Reaper souls

277
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:23,480
And people it'll be actually kind of fun. I think people are enjoying it that

278
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:26,769
still play it

279
00:30:26,930 --> 00:30:28,369
but

280
00:30:28,369 --> 00:30:34,009
No one who had the initial impression that they think it's bad is ever gonna go back and like try it again

281
00:30:35,369 --> 00:30:40,970
It would take years for like a whole new generation of people to just forget what it was like when they launched it

282
00:30:42,609 --> 00:30:44,609
People saying it's kind of fun

283
00:30:44,690 --> 00:30:50,059
Yeah, I've honestly not been hearing bad things about it what the launch was, you know

284
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:54,539
One of the worst I thought you understood what that insignia meant

285
00:30:56,059 --> 00:31:07,829
No power another brotherhood. I said this plan in motion and I am the only one who can stop them people like CBT, too

286
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:17,329
I'm surprised. That's the kind of comment you would read righteous crusade. Well, it looks like you don't know me very well, do you?

287
00:31:17,329 --> 00:31:22,309
I guess I don't been watching the stream lately. I don't know. Do you talk about CBT often? I might

288
00:31:23,150 --> 00:31:29,309
Know I thought CBT was a time zone when people started spamming it like a year ago. Oh really I think I thought it was

289
00:31:29,309 --> 00:31:31,309
Central British time

290
00:31:33,029 --> 00:31:37,960
Yeah, never mind I'm not joining now

291
00:31:52,069 --> 00:31:54,069
It's a follow I

292
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:18,920
Would take 30 less trash cans on the screen for this to run at 60 FPS

293
00:32:19,559 --> 00:32:22,500
And everyone else agree that with that

294
00:32:22,779 --> 00:32:32,019
Big agree, but there's the games always actually have that mod. Wait. No, I'm not supposed to be agreeing with you

295
00:32:32,019 --> 00:32:38,099
Oh, I think the the graphical fidelity is worth the loss of frames because I can't see over 24. Anyway

296
00:32:38,099 --> 00:32:43,500
Studio has now surpassed 18 million players and shows no signs of slowing down

297
00:32:43,859 --> 00:32:48,900
Right now still going enjoying the new Blackwood chapter part of the gates of oblivion your long

298
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:53,619
I feel like the whole Bethesda conference has me been going they're still working on this

299
00:32:54,339 --> 00:32:59,180
This is still a game. They haven't like liquidated this whole franchise. Like that's what I've been saying the whole time

300
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:06,000
So console enhanced this Tuesday the game would deliver a true native experience. I have heard for the series. No, wait, that's

301
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:14,539
That's fine. Repeat every single thing you said about fallout 76, but like change the wording to elder scrolls online

302
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:24,200
This is the mobile one. No, this is not the mobile. Yes. Look. Yeah, this looks like a mobile game. You tell them

303
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:26,380
No, no, no, I just

304
00:33:26,779 --> 00:33:32,940
Elder scrolls online that was the console one that it was I came on a console right?

305
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:36,619
That was a big deal. What came out on console? That was a big deal that it came out on console

306
00:33:37,259 --> 00:33:45,059
Right a big deal that an elder scrolls game came out on a console. It's an MMO

307
00:33:45,059 --> 00:33:51,319
It was like an MMO that came out on console again. Are you gonna play any games that have come out after 1980?

308
00:33:52,079 --> 00:33:56,430
Well, why is every question marking me? What am I talking about?

309
00:33:57,069 --> 00:34:05,680
Wasn't wasn't when this when this when this first came out wasn't it on console and that was like, oh my god an MMO on console

310
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:14,199
No way. Yes. Yeah, it was that was Final Fantasy 14

311
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:18,809
Remember you're wrong stop

312
00:34:19,050 --> 00:34:29,079
That was Final Fantasy 14. I mean like one guy might have said that I don't know if it was a thing

313
00:34:29,079 --> 00:34:33,750
I thought that's what I thought. That was a big deal. Oh shit. Wait fall guys

314
00:34:34,469 --> 00:34:37,289
Have they added? No, I'm not gonna be mean

315
00:34:37,929 --> 00:34:47,559
This is not fall guys

316
00:34:47,559 --> 00:34:55,280
yeah, if you want to like when you say you don't want to be mean if like a game comes up and you don't like

317
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,719
It but you don't want to be the one to say it

318
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:01,320
You want you want to just send you like a discord message every time I want to say something mean and you'll just say

319
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:06,340
No, no, you just ask me. What do you think about this and then I'll say it

320
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:20,639
Okay, I don't I don't have a filter. Oh, this actually kind of looks fun. This is that my bad game gang beasts

321
00:35:21,159 --> 00:35:24,639
Pretty sure this is like gang beast too. Yeah, is it yeah

322
00:35:25,239 --> 00:35:31,550
This looks like it could be fun kind of fun. Oh shit. This looks really fun

323
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:38,940
Well, not actually but yeah, it just looks like gangbeast

324
00:35:43,619 --> 00:36:01,039
Actually, it's kind of fun. Hey you play this game

325
00:36:01,679 --> 00:36:09,500
Wait, hold on before I say anything. I want to know what you felt about how you felt about this game

326
00:36:10,059 --> 00:36:14,559
I felt that okay now go what I just want to make sure I was ready

327
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,159
Okay, wait

328
00:36:17,159 --> 00:36:22,320
Why do you need to be ready? Because I just need to be ready. Are you capturing my soul?

329
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:27,960
I want to let's hear your thoughts. I want to hear my thoughts on Hades

330
00:36:28,599 --> 00:36:36,000
Are that I'm really sick and tired of rogue light games requiring you to lose multiple times claiming that it's because their game is hard

331
00:36:36,719 --> 00:36:39,639
Rather than just that they're gating you from being to

332
00:36:40,199 --> 00:36:43,079
Accessing the things you need to actually win the game from the start

333
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:47,690
You know, we go back to the back in the day gamers who played fucking binding of Isaac

334
00:36:47,690 --> 00:36:49,849
You could just go beat mom like what's the big deal?

335
00:36:50,050 --> 00:36:57,110
But nowadays Hades is like you got to play for a couple of hours before you can do plus 300% damage and double your health

336
00:36:58,230 --> 00:37:02,519
Sorry, I didn't listen

337
00:37:03,039 --> 00:37:10,840
Essentially that was my game of the year last year. How fucking dare you first of all and second of all was it?

338
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:16,199
Yeah, I think it's a good game except for the first part where you need to unlock things

339
00:37:16,679 --> 00:37:23,829
Here's here's the better example. I think Hades is encouraging the trend

340
00:37:23,989 --> 00:37:32,360
Have you played the last spell the last spell is a tower defense rogue like but here's the catch

341
00:37:32,599 --> 00:37:35,840
You can't actually build towers until you've lost a few times

342
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:40,079
You'd be a horrible boss to work for I think

343
00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:48,090
Somebody would come to you with a concept of like a thing that they were making it'd be you'd be like

344
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:51,480
Nope

345
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:56,889
redo it and then and then they would they would redo it like a hundred times and

346
00:37:57,289 --> 00:37:59,690
Then you would have already moved on to another project

347
00:38:02,789 --> 00:38:08,880
Well, I feel like I'm giving I feel like I'm giving actual reasons and not just I'm not just telling them

348
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:16,050
No, try again. I feel like I would I would offer some form of guidance, but then you would have the perfect thing

349
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:23,559
What's your favorite game of all time?

350
00:38:24,039 --> 00:38:31,739
Diablo 2 we can agree on that. Well, you're not supposed to be agreeing right now

351
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:37,380
Master Chief is back there

352
00:38:44,579 --> 00:38:52,789
Our goal has always been to bring players together and for the first time we're thrilled to offer our entire

353
00:38:53,510 --> 00:38:55,510
Quiet right now

354
00:38:57,389 --> 00:39:02,309
You said quiet there's halo I know and then you waited 20 seconds instead

355
00:39:02,309 --> 00:39:07,230
Why are we quiet and invite more of you than ever before to become a Spartan hero?

356
00:39:07,230 --> 00:39:12,329
I'm excited to be here with Joseph Staten the creative

357
00:39:13,130 --> 00:39:15,130
What's the last halo you played?

358
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:19,630
Me and me and Joel

359
00:39:20,829 --> 00:39:27,409
We played on legendary the the remake remaster one for 40 minutes and it's the only time I've ever played it

360
00:39:27,409 --> 00:39:30,170
I watched people play it and I was like

361
00:39:31,769 --> 00:39:33,769
Halo 2 I've never played a halo game

362
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:45,349
I don't know. It just never grabbed me for some reason. I don't know why

363
00:39:49,269 --> 00:39:51,269
Reloading

364
00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:58,869
Wait, do you reload and halo? Yeah, you do. Of course you do you shoot your battle rifle twice and then you reload

365
00:39:58,869 --> 00:40:01,239
I mean that this is a huge deal, right?

366
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:13,360
I'm very excited

367
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:23,199
All right, I was thinking about doing the puke thing I was thinking about going them but I was like I don't want to do

368
00:40:23,199 --> 00:40:36,710
That right now like people trying to watch you know, I like about Master Chief is he kills relentlessly

369
00:40:36,750 --> 00:40:38,750
But also it's clear that he cares

370
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:57,389
Okay, imagine me like landed on his like head

371
00:41:02,489 --> 00:41:04,489
That's all that's it

372
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:11,130
That's it

373
00:41:11,130 --> 00:41:13,050
It's too early

374
00:41:13,050 --> 00:41:18,960
So I need it

375
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:21,679
Hey, you know, you know how cool of a boss I would be

376
00:41:22,239 --> 00:41:27,969
How cool of a boss would you be drama you'd come into my office and it would be like a

377
00:41:28,610 --> 00:41:32,289
Transparent cup that has levels of like up here

378
00:41:32,289 --> 00:41:35,289
There's a there's a line that says don't even think about talking to me

379
00:41:35,289 --> 00:41:41,449
And then when the line is here and the coffees here, it's like maybe listening and then when it's down here the line right here

380
00:41:41,449 --> 00:41:44,789
It's like now's time not now's time for you to talk

381
00:41:46,809 --> 00:41:48,809
That's how you know, I'd be a cool boss

382
00:41:53,489 --> 00:41:57,199
You

383
00:41:57,239 --> 00:41:59,800
Okay, I don't know how to react

384
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:05,159
On successful deployment my deletion routine was supposed to complete

385
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:17,960
Good good something stopped your deletion. We need to find that Cortana or a new hollow girl

386
00:42:19,639 --> 00:42:25,199
Just people this is change people are getting furious with us if we stop we don't stop talking right now no gameplay

387
00:42:25,199 --> 00:42:46,039
No, bye. Stop talking. Of course. You can't have a halo game without multiplayer and on Xbox Series X

388
00:42:46,039 --> 00:42:51,119
You'll be able to enjoy infinite's multiplayer action at up to 120 frames per second

389
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:59,539
Finally, I'm very happy to announce that halo infinite's first free-to-play multiplayer season and infinite story-driven campaign

390
00:42:59,619 --> 00:43:02,000
We launched together this holiday

391
00:43:02,519 --> 00:43:06,440
A new day is this a new generation

392
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:11,480
This is halo. I just gotta let you know people are sitting at their table right now

393
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:16,559
And they are contemplating whether to give this restaurant of our stream like a two-star review

394
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:20,579
Where we're getting there? I was letting you know we all need to be careful here

395
00:43:20,579 --> 00:43:22,579
I just want to let that person know

396
00:43:22,699 --> 00:43:28,179
That they're sitting in a virtual restaurant and the only thing letting them like stopping them from going to a better restaurant

397
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:30,340
They don't even have to stand up

398
00:43:30,619 --> 00:43:35,619
They just click the special events where it says that under the stream and then like there's a whole bunch of options

399
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:39,820
You can just change the restaurant you're in. Yeah

400
00:43:40,579 --> 00:43:44,659
Yeah, you said that like a fucking Denny's or something and you just you know what?

401
00:43:44,980 --> 00:43:49,440
I'm really not into this like French toast grilled cheese. They just gave me

402
00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:53,500
That one Applebee's you just teleport into the seat

403
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:58,900
Yeah, so like they put down the pancakes in front of you at Denny's and you're like how these don't look that good

404
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:03,619
You just you switch you switch the channel and there's a new tray of food in front of you already

405
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:11,010
But do you have to pay you would have to pay right?

406
00:44:11,769 --> 00:44:14,380
Not no

407
00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:15,940
No, maybe no

408
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:17,940
so what's stopping somebody from just going just

409
00:44:17,980 --> 00:44:23,219
What about like the trolls that would just jump from restaurant to restaurant and order everything on the menu and just jump the galaxy?

410
00:44:23,219 --> 00:44:24,940
Jump to the next restaurant

411
00:44:24,940 --> 00:44:26,940
The customer is always right. Oh

412
00:44:28,139 --> 00:44:35,900
right

413
00:44:35,900 --> 00:45:00,309
Don't just run it all capitalism. Why are they talking? I would probably like payload twos multiplayer

414
00:45:01,130 --> 00:45:10,570
I thought is this it always looked really fun to me. Well, it's free to play. So you're definitely gonna try it out, right?

415
00:45:12,699 --> 00:45:21,380
That one looked always the most fun. What about it? Oh, no, just driving the cars around running over people

416
00:45:21,380 --> 00:45:27,619
Oh, you can't do that in three, but it just seems cleaner. It seemed more fun. I've seen three

417
00:45:29,019 --> 00:45:33,539
Shut up. I'm serious over Elden ring, right?

418
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:35,860
Stop talking. This is my why I'm here

419
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:40,940
As the Diablo figure wanders, I know there's five dude

420
00:45:41,619 --> 00:45:43,530
game of the year

421
00:45:43,530 --> 00:45:59,829
Must be stopped. It's my fucking like I'm ready

422
00:46:00,429 --> 00:46:08,730
Are you not excited for this? I heard it's very good

423
00:46:11,449 --> 00:46:23,360
Wow, I even have mixed feelings about my game of the year joke. I mean it looks great

424
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:28,960
It's so close one to one to the actual Diablo 2 that

425
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:36,159
The bugs that Diablo 2 has that like speedruns use it kept everything even like really weirdly obscure mechanical things

426
00:46:36,559 --> 00:46:41,119
Really? So it's it's like as authentic of a remaster as you could possibly get

427
00:46:42,039 --> 00:46:50,610
Because this is I've I've wanted this for a decade and a half at least

428
00:46:51,570 --> 00:46:59,699
Well, see my only mixed feeling is that I I never stopped playing Diablo 2 so like a graphical update doesn't even

429
00:47:00,340 --> 00:47:04,699
But don't you think this is important to remember here don't you think that

430
00:47:05,659 --> 00:47:09,539
Having a Diablo 2 on the blizzard launcher

431
00:47:10,059 --> 00:47:12,699
Means we'll get interesting updates to the game

432
00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:19,849
No, you don't think they'll add stuff to it like items potentially really doubt they would add things to it

433
00:47:19,849 --> 00:47:26,719
I feel like whenever you add things to a remaster the purists start complaining and then you you're afraid

434
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:32,349
Even look like even patches though even stuff that like people have been begging for well

435
00:47:32,349 --> 00:47:35,909
That's what I mean is that they have bugs from Diablo 2 are

436
00:47:36,510 --> 00:47:45,079
Remastered to be authentically bugged from like still so if they're not patching that they're not gonna what is happening on this?

437
00:47:45,079 --> 00:47:50,719
I don't know is this is this by the is this me or is this the this is the stream, but he's my brother

438
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:54,130
And I would die remastered

439
00:47:55,889 --> 00:47:58,329
This is not Diablo, but it just got louder

440
00:48:01,449 --> 00:48:03,809
Why is this this got like 30% louder

441
00:48:04,690 --> 00:48:18,150
My only concern would be able to remastered is that Diablo 2 has a whole bunch of mods, and I hope that

442
00:48:18,750 --> 00:48:20,750
Blizzard doesn't restrict

443
00:48:20,750 --> 00:48:24,789
Mods being able to make be made of the remastered because otherwise

444
00:48:25,349 --> 00:48:28,429
To me do like actual Diablo 2 is still just gonna be better

445
00:48:29,190 --> 00:48:30,389
hmm

446
00:48:30,389 --> 00:48:44,179
Stir shut up stir shut dude this game came out like two years ago. It's the new games and cinematics no gameplay no buy

447
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:48,900
You

448
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:55,780
Give a bunch of policies apparently that I didn't know I have a lot of policies no gameplay no buy no chatter left behind

449
00:48:56,380 --> 00:49:02,219
But what if what can we have one trailer where we don't talk just one this one?

450
00:49:02,219 --> 00:49:07,019
Okay, ready is like the fourth time. They've shown this game, but this one. Let's just see if we can do it

451
00:49:08,579 --> 00:49:10,820
But if we're gonna do it why this game?

452
00:49:12,579 --> 00:49:14,579
Okay, okay

453
00:49:15,179 --> 00:49:17,480
Let me ask you a question

454
00:49:17,519 --> 00:49:26,760
When I am dead and Yara is burning, what exactly is your plan whole hands sing songs around the fire

455
00:49:51,369 --> 00:49:53,369
It really was just like

456
00:49:53,489 --> 00:50:00,280
I

457
00:50:29,639 --> 00:50:39,239
Somebody said NBC comedy intro trailer like the music I was gonna say this music is a little oh

458
00:50:48,250 --> 00:50:51,579
You know that they're killing people

459
00:50:53,690 --> 00:50:58,289
Whatever happened in games where we honor the death of the fallen I want to play like crazy back, but you

460
00:50:59,170 --> 00:51:07,860
know this is worse this is like an NBC compilation of all their comedy trailers and like and and and

461
00:51:08,179 --> 00:51:14,519
Michael walks out just like it's happening. It's happening. Is Ubisoft really gonna make light of revolution

462
00:51:26,949 --> 00:51:38,400
This is a lot of fun all right don't talk if I called it from the clouds, I'm gonna keep talking

463
00:51:39,079 --> 00:51:48,260
onto drag knock online

464
00:51:48,260 --> 00:51:55,139
Everybody's a slime rancher devs. Are you shooting me? Oh, I want a real. I want reaction for this one

465
00:52:38,429 --> 00:52:40,429
It's too early for that shit

466
00:52:40,989 --> 00:52:42,429
all right

467
00:52:42,429 --> 00:52:44,429
Slime rancher was all do you play slime rancher?

468
00:52:44,750 --> 00:52:49,650
Yeah, I love that would have been my game of the year if I played it when it was actually relevant

469
00:52:49,650 --> 00:52:55,320
I can like 2017 or something right? Yeah, I think I played it too early

470
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:57,960
I never played like I loved it

471
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:03,320
When I played it, but it was very good. I'm actually really excited for that. That's I love that game, so let's see

472
00:53:15,929 --> 00:53:21,800
It's been a while since we have had a real good snowboarding game, right? Oh

473
00:53:37,199 --> 00:53:39,199
steep yes steep, but steep was uh

474
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:47,679
It was more than snowboarding game. It was a wingsuit game. I guess you could count that though

475
00:53:47,679 --> 00:53:58,420
I get the appeal of snowboarding games and games like this

476
00:53:58,420 --> 00:54:04,360
But I just can't play them because I end up trying to do a backflip for too long and don't land the third back flip

477
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:10,739
I mean, I get way too overzealous with the tricks on the snowboarding game, and I just fall down every time

478
00:54:19,079 --> 00:54:26,570
You actually get to do that that'd be actually kind of fun if you could be the camera guy I

479
00:54:29,030 --> 00:54:31,030
Okay, right that one down. I'm serious

480
00:54:31,550 --> 00:54:35,980
Writing it down as if they if you can be the camera guy then I'm I need to play that

481
00:54:36,139 --> 00:54:51,619
On my cart, I feel like atomic heart is going to be cyberpunk 2077 without all of the hype

482
00:54:54,989 --> 00:54:56,989
Maybe better

483
00:55:10,369 --> 00:55:22,960
This what is this song is it getting you pumped me kinda

484
00:55:23,380 --> 00:55:38,210
It was 80s Russian pop. What was that? I won. I'm kind of curious about what that was

485
00:55:48,679 --> 00:55:53,630
Hype meter fog meter just filled up 200. I don't have a fog meter

486
00:55:54,150 --> 00:56:10,000
Haven't you made this tweet before where you're like, I'm you're one of those people that say you are sick of games that have pixels in them

487
00:56:13,230 --> 00:56:18,019
Did I I feel like I feel like you've been there

488
00:56:18,639 --> 00:56:23,760
Maybe because I was shocked that you would have one of the lowest forms of opinion. I

489
00:56:25,929 --> 00:56:32,570
Think pixel part if done. Well, I'm pixel art can be I think it's like it has a big range

490
00:56:33,570 --> 00:56:37,449
Yes, it's almost like you can arrange pixels and do like a lot of different things with them

491
00:56:37,449 --> 00:56:43,030
I mean that this this is look this looks gore. This is gorgeous. Let me just say, okay

492
00:56:43,690 --> 00:57:21,409
There's a range in pixel art. I'm very interested quiet write that one down, too

493
00:57:21,530 --> 00:57:29,349
Okay, am I actually I didn't write down the last one. Why didn't I don't even remember what the last one was?

494
00:57:29,349 --> 00:57:34,920
Why didn't you not write it down? I'll write this one down. What was the other one? I don't remember it was a snowboard game

495
00:57:35,059 --> 00:57:39,070
No, it wasn't that was the one I told you to write down was a snowboard game

496
00:57:39,469 --> 00:57:43,099
in the first year of grounded

497
00:57:45,150 --> 00:57:47,150
Millions of players kept busy

498
00:57:49,210 --> 00:57:52,590
With crafting it's a billions of players

499
00:58:01,099 --> 00:58:07,300
Billions

500
00:58:10,019 --> 00:58:14,460
To celebrate everyone at birth getting an account tied to their ID

501
00:58:25,019 --> 00:58:27,940
But not those guys

502
00:58:31,519 --> 00:58:33,519
Why have I never even heard of this

503
00:58:40,989 --> 00:58:49,860
You should probably turn on arachnophobia mode, oh even her blob scares this of us

504
00:58:56,389 --> 00:58:59,400
Or never go home

505
00:59:00,360 --> 00:59:08,059
Oh, honey, I shrunk the kids right. Oh, and it looks like we added achievements to nice

506
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
Okay, I'm writing this one down. I

507
00:59:11,039 --> 00:59:16,800
Would say this is what Jerma sees every day

508
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:21,099
Okay among us to

509
00:59:21,659 --> 00:59:36,349
Enter the sauce guy. All right, so I'm gonna take a screenshot of this so I can pretend like I played it

510
00:59:36,789 --> 00:59:44,400
Is that important so you can prove that I was in a different clothing. I threw up my backs

511
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:46,519
I just threw my back out. I just literally pulled the muscle my back

512
00:59:47,079 --> 00:59:50,219
I'm worried about you

513
00:59:52,130 --> 00:59:54,130
Like if you move you hurt yourself

514
00:59:54,130 --> 01:00:00,239
Oh, I just pulled a muscle down the left side of my back cuz I've you hurt yourself putting on deodorant

515
01:00:00,719 --> 01:00:06,349
That was stupid do the face

516
01:00:06,949 --> 01:00:14,409
No, I did. I need to drink some more water. I got water right here

517
01:00:14,929 --> 01:00:20,320
Yeah, I know what's happening right now. No gameplay. No, but I

518
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:50,840
What is it? I don't know. His stories will be it's like this 2d 3d thing is kind of cool looking though

519
01:00:52,679 --> 01:00:54,679
Why am I doing that without eating fucking like

520
01:00:56,840 --> 01:00:58,940
I

521
01:00:58,940 --> 01:01:09,449
Yeah, and I don't know

522
01:01:13,559 --> 01:01:15,559
I don't have a reaction for you

523
01:01:15,639 --> 01:01:22,389
Wait, how did you see that before I did? I thought you were saying and what's your reaction Jeremy?

524
01:01:22,389 --> 01:01:27,719
I didn't know that no, I'm I have the paid for stream that you actually had seconds in advance

525
01:01:27,719 --> 01:01:30,900
Yeah, am I actually like 10 seconds behind?

526
01:01:32,530 --> 01:01:36,210
You could try refreshing like that's better

527
01:01:43,170 --> 01:01:45,170
No, what

528
01:01:45,489 --> 01:01:53,619
There's like binaural audio

529
01:01:53,820 --> 01:01:56,639
Yeah, I feel completely

530
01:01:57,079 --> 01:01:59,079
explicit and I love the government now

531
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:05,210
That's the shit you listen to when like you really want to go to bed before a big event that you're really really excited for like

532
01:02:05,210 --> 01:02:09,289
The first ever packs being a content creator and you couldn't fucking fall asleep

533
01:02:09,289 --> 01:02:11,329
It was four or five or six a.m

534
01:02:11,329 --> 01:02:17,530
And you had to be up at 11 and you just put on binaural beats in both ears fucking so pissed off that you can't

535
01:02:17,530 --> 01:02:21,809
Go to bed and you just please fucking work so I can be go. I'm like a content creator now

536
01:02:22,690 --> 01:02:40,239
Didn't work. I mean, I wanted I want to throw up question marks, but a lot of people are plus doing you

537
01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:46,480
So I just I'm glad I just turned off the webcam right when I spilled coffee all over me. It just went all over me

538
01:02:47,320 --> 01:03:02,179
You need to live in like in a home. You know what? I mean? I'm fine. Okay

539
01:03:03,099 --> 01:03:09,440
No, I failed another

540
01:03:10,039 --> 01:03:34,139
I'm fine. Yeah, I don't know about this game. I'm kind of bored of games taking place like on earth

541
01:03:34,780 --> 01:03:37,639
You know what? I mean?

542
01:03:37,639 --> 01:03:43,840
Like the entire universe is boring you so I think I'm just gonna be the opposite again

543
01:03:44,119 --> 01:03:49,599
And say like any game that takes place on a planet. It's just I think a little overdone

544
01:03:49,599 --> 01:03:51,599
I think I'm just I think I think we're just too spoiled

545
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:57,619
And I mean like there's been so many video games in the last two or three decades that all summer been so good

546
01:03:57,699 --> 01:04:04,829
That's just like outer galactic exploration. Yeah, we both hate one because this is a planet in space

547
01:04:04,829 --> 01:04:06,829
So like I'm just I'm over it

548
01:04:26,530 --> 01:04:33,250
Suddenly and for no reason we added combat goons to our game. We needed shooting. I was intrigued until a moment ago

549
01:04:34,809 --> 01:04:39,090
But this is but I we said you talked about this last year constant conflict

550
01:04:40,050 --> 01:04:43,570
It has to be constant conflict

551
01:04:44,619 --> 01:04:52,940
I think I'm being parody

552
01:04:58,849 --> 01:05:02,570
Silhouette because the developers haven't finished the design

553
01:05:03,130 --> 01:05:12,320
Finished the story or finished any gameplay that's actually ready to show in fact, the only thing they have finished

554
01:05:13,119 --> 01:05:17,019
Is the title?

555
01:05:18,059 --> 01:05:26,260
Wait, really? Why?

556
01:05:32,300 --> 01:05:37,739
No gameplay. No, bye. I played the first I played through the whole first one. It was

557
01:05:39,550 --> 01:05:47,190
Okay, it was fun. I mean that we're getting it too. I feel like they there's isn't a DLC that is still making for the first one

558
01:05:47,750 --> 01:06:02,449
Yeah, there are. Yep. They are. That's what I mean. Like it's

559
01:06:02,969 --> 01:06:17,159
It seems pretty this is really close to having a second one. I also feel like

560
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:20,179
You would probably like flight simulator

561
01:06:20,780 --> 01:06:24,230
You kind of really don't do much

562
01:06:24,269 --> 01:06:32,280
Like a one-button kind of game. What's that supposed to mean? This just seems like the game that you seem to like

563
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:37,380
like

564
01:06:37,380 --> 01:06:41,010
Like those euro truck simulators to you probably really enjoy

565
01:06:41,769 --> 01:06:45,929
Earth game resident sleeper earth game

566
01:06:46,570 --> 01:06:48,570
Yeah

567
01:06:59,010 --> 01:07:04,769
Constant conflict right? Yeah, these planes are in constant cut they're in competition to get there. Do you see how many there were I

568
01:07:12,889 --> 01:07:18,369
Don't I was I was honestly curious about your opinion and why you would or would not like this and I feel like you just deflected

569
01:07:18,369 --> 01:07:23,820
I would probably like it. I don't not saying I wouldn't when it came out

570
01:07:23,820 --> 01:07:26,380
I just don't think I had a good enough graphics card to be able to play it. Oh

571
01:07:34,809 --> 01:07:42,690
Is this top gun actually might be

572
01:08:00,460 --> 01:08:03,980
Do it do it do me a favor do me a hit pause on your on your hit pause on your stream

573
01:08:03,980 --> 01:08:06,460
No, just do it. Just do it. Just do it, but just please do it ready, right?

574
01:08:06,460 --> 01:08:09,019
Ready pause the pause ready one two three

575
01:08:10,219 --> 01:08:12,219
four five

576
01:08:12,340 --> 01:08:17,039
No, I'm back. You were you were not that far behind me. I was I was it really was

577
01:08:17,560 --> 01:08:20,119
Can we both just press refresh at the same time?

578
01:08:20,479 --> 01:08:22,539
But I'm

579
01:08:22,539 --> 01:08:26,479
Capturing the browser. All right. Let's tell me what you see. So am I

580
01:08:27,159 --> 01:08:32,220
Rain, I see cactuses. I see rocks

581
01:08:32,739 --> 01:08:34,869
grass a car

582
01:08:34,869 --> 01:08:40,659
You see how do you see a car? Oh, I'm pausing for like you're so far behind you are so far

583
01:08:40,659 --> 01:08:48,460
All right. How do I refresh this f5 on all browsers? I'm not I'm not I'm capturing the actual like embedded. Oh

584
01:08:49,220 --> 01:08:50,779
That's what you mean

585
01:08:50,779 --> 01:08:52,779
Yeah, no, then I just pause more

586
01:08:53,140 --> 01:09:02,859
When the splash screen comes up that says like the name of the game like car driver

587
01:09:03,979 --> 01:09:05,979
Atlantic tell me okay

588
01:09:06,539 --> 01:09:19,300
Low latency mode. I do have low latency mode on yeah. All right, so the Jeep just went through the outdoor car wash

589
01:09:19,739 --> 01:09:27,930
Just getting on the road doing things that are gonna get us absolutely arrested pulled over illegal. What else that's the whole trailer

590
01:09:27,930 --> 01:09:32,890
I think I'm behind you now. Wait, hold on. We'll find out

591
01:09:33,609 --> 01:09:54,649
Inside the car both of us. They say both paws on the title

592
01:09:55,250 --> 01:10:04,329
Posing I'm on the title. I'm so far ahead of you. I'm paused on the title. Yeah, I

593
01:10:06,460 --> 01:10:11,619
Go, I don't think pausing will fix it. Wait, wait, no, no, no, just refresh it. I refreshed. I'm good

594
01:10:11,619 --> 01:10:16,060
I can't wait to show you what we've been working on. I'm like live now. I think

595
01:10:16,659 --> 01:10:20,939
Oh your streams live. No, like I think I'm like live like I'm getting the live feed

596
01:10:22,939 --> 01:10:24,939
Whatever I'll just like delay my reaction

597
01:10:25,539 --> 01:10:29,699
largest and most diverse open world ever in a Forza Horizon game

598
01:10:30,460 --> 01:10:35,340
And there is no better car to explore it than the stunning. Oh, what's your opinion on cars?

599
01:10:36,819 --> 01:10:44,659
Um in unparalleled detail, they did look nice in Forza Vista. Thanks to the power. That's a pretty humble opinion for someone who drives a Ferrari

600
01:10:48,039 --> 01:10:55,069
I've invited along some of the team to help you I can do that some of the amazing content that's waiting for you in Forza

601
01:10:55,069 --> 01:10:57,069
Like seriously, that's fucking so annoying

602
01:11:01,069 --> 01:11:03,069
Hey Mike

603
01:11:03,949 --> 01:11:10,449
Hey, what's up Mike and we also have Abraham with us as well. He's one of the talented actors who will be appearing in the game

604
01:11:12,350 --> 01:11:16,550
When you were riding around me fucking sir should have a lot to say about how cool it was and

605
01:11:17,869 --> 01:11:20,689
Now you want to like talk shit. That's fine. You campaign well

606
01:11:24,270 --> 01:11:27,630
You made a bunch of comments about the sun roof and how fucking cool that was I

607
01:11:28,510 --> 01:11:33,590
Mean it was cool. I'm just saying that your opinion on cars is like

608
01:11:34,470 --> 01:11:37,189
You're really not that into them to be a guy in a Ferrari

609
01:11:38,390 --> 01:11:40,390
You know, I don't think you appreciate it

610
01:11:54,600 --> 01:12:01,659
That's a peek at our adventurous campaign but Forza Horizon has always been a game that's best enjoyed with others

611
01:12:02,220 --> 01:12:04,859
Let's go and see what some of our other players are up to

612
01:12:05,579 --> 01:12:09,859
The Xbox series consoles allow us to capture every last detail

613
01:12:09,979 --> 01:12:13,500
What are they up to the individual needles on these cholla cactus?

614
01:12:14,020 --> 01:12:16,960
What is what you told me to wait a second? I'm like waiting for you

615
01:12:18,699 --> 01:12:21,699
Because it was like the e3 we're like people talking

616
01:12:23,060 --> 01:12:27,279
Yeah, cars, but it's like the fake multiplayer like we were talking

617
01:12:29,140 --> 01:12:32,979
This is one of my favorite things about e3 is when you have the like fake gamer moment

618
01:12:33,140 --> 01:12:37,939
Especially when you have people communicating over voice and they say all the things that no one would ever say

619
01:12:40,659 --> 01:12:48,470
Let's watch let's leave Maddie for a moment and head out to the coast and meet Don

620
01:12:49,189 --> 01:12:53,989
Don is already on the move exploring this idyllic seaside town

621
01:12:54,369 --> 01:13:02,029
This is a recreation of Mexico that is honest authentic and filled with love. That's why is there somebody fucking gameplay? Oh

622
01:13:02,369 --> 01:13:04,090
Hey, what's up?

623
01:13:04,130 --> 01:13:07,729
This is a mural by Mexican artist Farid Rueda

624
01:13:08,130 --> 01:13:14,010
Just one of the many beautiful faithful pieces of Mexico. You'll find all over for to horizon five

625
01:13:17,399 --> 01:13:24,020
Like oh, let's check on see what what's dawn up to

626
01:13:28,460 --> 01:13:30,899
Fuck you doing who are you? Why are you in my game?

627
01:13:31,539 --> 01:13:35,460
Using photogrammetry data captured on location atop an active

628
01:13:35,739 --> 01:13:42,140
Mexican volcano the entire world has been recreated at this level of detail. I'm not really feeling this one

629
01:13:44,539 --> 01:13:46,539
It's just another earth game

630
01:13:49,859 --> 01:13:54,460
That I just actually looks good consoles, but I mean the actual graphics

631
01:13:55,739 --> 01:14:01,460
I'm really yeah, I'm very happy that consoles have caught up to what PCs could do like six years ago

632
01:14:01,460 --> 01:14:03,460
Because

633
01:14:03,779 --> 01:14:07,060
Games have been looking good lately cities anywhere in the world

634
01:14:07,380 --> 01:14:11,659
It's a colorful undulating city full of vibrant architecture

635
01:14:11,659 --> 01:14:19,020
Yeah, even has a sprawling network of tunnels and these twisting turning, but it's a box that you buy once every eight years

636
01:14:22,140 --> 01:14:25,779
Is usually under four or five hundred dollars the eliminator

637
01:14:26,899 --> 01:14:29,619
Yeah, but you have to pay for your internet on it separately

638
01:14:32,460 --> 01:14:37,939
Open-world let's head north to the can we mean the horizon so if you want to play online games

639
01:14:37,939 --> 01:14:44,199
Don't you need like a PlayStation plus subscription HDR camera rig captured 24-hour shoots?

640
01:14:46,199 --> 01:14:48,680
Four years if you're paying $15 a month

641
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:51,520
How much was it?

642
01:14:52,199 --> 01:14:54,199
You have to pay for internet no matter what

643
01:14:54,680 --> 01:15:01,279
Well, why is the internet I'm talking about like a beast computer that can run insane ultra settings is usually more than a thousand

644
01:15:01,319 --> 01:15:03,319
1500 bucks in it

645
01:15:03,800 --> 01:15:09,640
Run like a game on like ultra and have it be the look good. You need like a pretty beefy computer

646
01:15:12,600 --> 01:15:19,159
Not really anymore actually well, okay, you know what I mean, I'm not gonna argue that they aren't more expensive than

647
01:15:21,560 --> 01:15:23,560
It's actually gone a lot cheaper

648
01:15:32,279 --> 01:15:38,720
Knows that bill loves minigames so intelligently prompts Sierra to invite bill and 80 I don't have 1080

649
01:15:41,800 --> 01:15:46,319
With that horizon arcade minigames starting soon all of our players are coming together

650
01:15:47,720 --> 01:15:49,720
For a second I thought these are people

651
01:15:52,840 --> 01:15:54,840
Oh gamer track

652
01:15:56,720 --> 01:16:00,960
Our players now have to work together to find and pop as many as they can

653
01:16:01,279 --> 01:16:03,279
Okay, go up here to the left

654
01:16:09,770 --> 01:16:11,770
You know what I figured out about this

655
01:16:12,250 --> 01:16:16,409
These these people are all streaming the game. That's what I figured out

656
01:16:16,409 --> 01:16:18,609
We're going over to the stage because when you stream a video game

657
01:16:18,609 --> 01:16:23,810
This is an inside information you guys you you have to say everything you fucking doing because you're terrified of dead silence is

658
01:16:24,529 --> 01:16:27,250
Going through the balls incredible. Whoa big turn

659
01:16:27,729 --> 01:16:33,510
You watch out you don't have to though you do though you do you can be comfortable with silence

660
01:16:35,329 --> 01:16:41,130
They're all screaming the game they're all making videos streaming I think they'd be louder

661
01:16:42,329 --> 01:16:43,489
Okay

662
01:16:43,489 --> 01:16:45,180
Yeah

663
01:16:45,180 --> 01:16:48,180
Forza Horizon 5 is the largest most fun

664
01:16:49,220 --> 01:16:51,300
I was gonna make a really specific

665
01:16:52,300 --> 01:16:56,859
Example reference showcase for the X what it's seven like seven years. I'm just gonna let them go

666
01:16:59,140 --> 01:17:03,180
Thank you. When is it gonna end? I'll see you all in this. It's a big deal for a lot of people

667
01:17:04,020 --> 01:17:16,649
Team Xbox is on a mission to bring the joy and community of gaming to everyone on the planet

668
01:17:16,890 --> 01:17:21,050
That's why you the gamer are at the center of everything we do

669
01:17:21,689 --> 01:17:24,170
Today we showed you 30 games

670
01:17:25,090 --> 01:17:27,930
27 of them will be available on Xbox game pass

671
01:17:28,489 --> 01:17:32,850
Now through the end of the year you can look forward to back-to-back

672
01:17:33,250 --> 01:17:34,810
Monthly releases

673
01:17:34,810 --> 01:17:42,369
Landing day one on game pass led by five new titles from Xbox game studios as well as highly

674
01:17:42,810 --> 01:17:50,130
Anticipated games like back for blood 12 minutes and the ascent and as we look ahead to next year

675
01:17:50,130 --> 01:17:55,210
I'm inspired by the creativity of Bethesda and Xbox game studios

676
01:17:56,250 --> 01:18:00,050
We showed you the highly anticipated RPG starfield

677
01:18:00,890 --> 01:18:02,890
Coming exclusively to Xbox

678
01:18:03,289 --> 01:18:09,170
But we all know that some of the industry's best RPG storytellers working on about

679
01:18:09,289 --> 01:18:17,029
They're still making a fable that's not canceled fallout 76. I think so the outer worlds to I mean apparently elder scrolls six

680
01:18:18,050 --> 01:18:24,630
We unveiled the stunning multiplayer mode for the world's most beloved shooter in Halo infinite

681
01:18:25,130 --> 01:18:28,210
Adding to the roster of iconic Xbox shooters

682
01:18:28,810 --> 01:18:33,649
Alongside Wolfenstein years of war perfect dark in doom

683
01:18:34,369 --> 01:18:40,810
We premiered the most everybody said why is he nodding and listening so intently he doesn't even have an xbox

684
01:18:40,810 --> 01:18:46,810
You have vibrant and authentic depiction of me. I don't know in a game. What does Xbox games come to PC?

685
01:18:48,729 --> 01:18:55,289
Ten is hard at work on the next what's the motors also apparently you just love Phil our growing family

686
01:18:55,970 --> 01:19:00,810
Smart guy studios is devoted to advancing the medium. We all love

687
01:19:02,029 --> 01:19:07,189
That camera change was perfect has been here for 20 years and that's because of you

688
01:19:07,630 --> 01:19:14,689
Our team strives to make Xbox a place where you'll find the greatest games the most dedicated

689
01:19:15,189 --> 01:19:17,890
developers and the most passionate community

01:19:18,590 --> 01:19:23,069
Together we all make Xbox coming up the best place to play

691
01:19:24,069 --> 01:19:25,670
Before I go

692
01:19:25,670 --> 01:19:27,550
There's one more thing

693
01:19:27,550 --> 01:19:30,300
Take a look at this brand new

694
01:19:30,939 --> 01:19:38,020
Original game from the arcane team at Bethesda the studio that created prey and dishonored

695
01:19:39,180 --> 01:19:45,699
Arcane created something new for them an open world immersive shooter that you can play alone

696
01:19:46,100 --> 01:19:52,420
Or with your friends and like starfield death loop this game will be an xbox

697
01:19:52,899 --> 01:19:54,340
exclusive

698
01:19:54,340 --> 01:20:10,960
the death loop

699
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:26,560
probably

700
01:20:39,710 --> 01:20:43,750
I'm sorry. I've seen five distinct four distinct characters, but it's about a real

701
01:20:53,159 --> 01:20:56,720
Piper with a sans eye I'm interested

702
01:21:10,970 --> 01:21:20,970
Wait is it a four-player shoot the people running at you game

703
01:21:37,810 --> 01:21:44,729
Redfall Massachusetts behind me. We are witnessing clear signs of cult activity as the locals

704
01:21:49,529 --> 01:21:58,689
I wasn't why somebody does have to be vlogging. I was just here to record a vlog and I accidentally ended up shooting them all

705
01:21:59,970 --> 01:22:03,239
America

706
01:22:07,970 --> 01:22:14,750
It is it's a four-player shoot the people running at you game

707
01:22:49,680 --> 01:22:51,680
No, let's go off to

708
01:22:53,880 --> 01:22:57,920
Somebody says can we mute the Diablo 2 nerd that hates everything

709
01:22:59,819 --> 01:23:08,670
Are you talking about me you're talking about him? I don't know people don't like me you should mute me

710
01:23:12,020 --> 01:23:13,659
Both of you

711
01:23:13,659 --> 01:23:21,079
Yeah, I don't hate everything you see my pog face during slime rancher 2

712
01:23:21,640 --> 01:23:30,439
I'm willing to give arcane studios the benefit of doubt on anything, but like these types of characters. I don't know

713
01:23:31,899 --> 01:23:37,899
They set a certain tone for a game that I don't expect to like and also by the way, no gameplay. No, but

714
01:23:38,380 --> 01:23:51,140
This is oh, it's not gameplay. I don't know why I thought this was gameplay. I was like, oh game. It's worked. Oh

715
01:23:53,260 --> 01:23:59,100
Yes, this gameplay I'm actually really impressed now all in engine footage. This is great

716
01:23:59,500 --> 01:24:10,600
Every game has to have a sniper. I get it. Every game has the rocket launcher and every Bethesda game has to have a little robot

717
01:24:10,979 --> 01:24:16,260
Yeah, and it takes place on earth. I know this no no, that's not Bethesda. That's gearbox. What am I talking about?

718
01:24:16,819 --> 01:24:31,350
Wait, is it there's a little robot in every Bethesda game too. No, I'm thinking of um, what's the game with Peter Dinklage?

719
01:24:31,949 --> 01:24:40,899
The game with Peter Dinklage. Yeah, it's in the game. Yeah when he replaced him because his voice lines were so bad

720
01:24:42,430 --> 01:24:44,430
Destiny. Yeah. Yeah

721
01:24:44,750 --> 01:24:48,149
That's a little remind me that just every time I see like a little robot, dude

722
01:24:48,590 --> 01:24:55,239
The one the first vampire guide looked like the outsider

723
01:24:56,340 --> 01:24:57,619
from

724
01:24:57,619 --> 01:24:59,939
Dishonored I was confused. I thought they were doing like

725
01:25:00,619 --> 01:25:06,439
Like a PlayStation all-stars mashup and that robot was from like some game. I don't know

726
01:25:11,359 --> 01:25:17,810
Destiny's fun though, isn't it? Oh, just nice fun though in it. It is. No, it's I'm serious. Like isn't it?

727
01:25:17,810 --> 01:25:25,350
I played the first one for a little bit. It was fun to shoot stuff

728
01:25:25,630 --> 01:25:32,079
You know for all the people that are that are like, you know, sir, you're annoying. Yeah, destiny 2 is a great game

729
01:25:39,140 --> 01:25:42,539
It was even more annoying that he didn't complain about it

730
01:25:43,340 --> 01:25:49,859
Honestly, I picked the wrong person to stream this conference. But I want something. I want something that's like oh shit

731
01:25:50,779 --> 01:25:53,819
I mean, I asked you if you wanted to so it's my fault

732
01:25:55,140 --> 01:26:02,279
Just hates everything. He's bashes everything. He's one of those BP bashes. He's angry

733
01:26:03,159 --> 01:26:15,279
Some of this stuff does look pretty good. I mean age of it. That's it. Is that a remake?

734
01:26:15,800 --> 01:26:21,289
It is right age of empires. No, actually, I think it is the

735
01:26:22,329 --> 01:26:26,930
The thing that most interested me this entire conference

736
01:26:27,649 --> 01:26:34,590
Was them saying we're still working on a fable and they didn't even show it since when are they working on fable?

737
01:26:35,029 --> 01:26:38,939
I think I think he was just saying that they're like currently working on it

738
01:26:39,220 --> 01:26:43,939
Yeah, but it was like the briefest of name drops of like I am we're working like we what?

739
01:26:44,819 --> 01:26:48,500
Yeah, but how long has it been? Holy shit. We've been here for an hour and a half

740
01:26:49,340 --> 01:26:50,750
Yeah

741
01:26:50,750 --> 01:26:53,289
Wait, what?

742
01:26:53,289 --> 01:26:59,680
How did that go by that my brain that did not process that an hour a half has gone by time goes by fast when you're

743
01:26:59,680 --> 01:27:01,680
Just having lots of fun

744
01:27:01,920 --> 01:27:06,489
That I've been having no fun with you. That's the thing. I've actually hated every second of being this

745
01:27:06,489 --> 01:27:10,050
I think that I think that you're being you're playing coy and you've had so much fun

746
01:27:10,970 --> 01:27:17,229
So what what's what's the what's the big one? I feel like I missed everything

747
01:27:18,109 --> 01:27:24,439
What do you mean you I missed everything the big one they started with starfield

748
01:27:24,619 --> 01:27:34,979
Yeah, but that was an hour and a half ago. So you forgot you missed Elden Ring. No, I'm just kidding

749
01:27:34,979 --> 01:27:40,659
I saw the trailer that looks fucking awesome. Yeah. All right, wait, we gotta talk about elder Elden Ring for a second

750
01:27:41,300 --> 01:27:43,619
Am I to be am I wrong here?

751
01:27:43,619 --> 01:27:51,039
It's it's an open world from software like Dark Souls game like open like complete or is it because don't mean Dark Souls is open

752
01:27:51,039 --> 01:27:53,560
World technically right but like a big open world

753
01:27:55,970 --> 01:28:00,369
Supposedly and you get a horse but why they give you a horse if you didn't have somewhere to go

754
01:28:00,369 --> 01:28:04,250
Why are they making that such a point because all the other Dark Souls games were kind of open world, weren't they?

755
01:28:04,329 --> 01:28:10,489
They've not really they were open in that different paths connected to each other, but they weren't actually open

756
01:28:10,489 --> 01:28:14,850
I can't imagine how crazy they've been an open world Dark Souls kind of game

757
01:28:14,850 --> 01:28:22,470
It has open fields, but it still has some the same dungeons like Dark Souls

758
01:28:22,470 --> 01:28:25,710
I don't know

759
01:28:25,829 --> 01:28:30,909
Well, but here's something really important about about the guy in the call right now the last from software game that came out

760
01:28:30,909 --> 01:28:32,909
He didn't finish but I did

761
01:28:33,029 --> 01:28:42,029
Which one was the last one? It's Kero. Remember you did not beat the last boss in secure. Oh, you were like this game's dumb

762
01:28:42,029 --> 01:28:44,029
I don't want to even complete it. You're

763
01:28:44,789 --> 01:28:49,710
You're bringing up games that are the most likely to make people not like me

764
01:28:50,710 --> 01:28:53,399
Hold on. I guess for this add-up

765
01:28:53,439 --> 01:28:57,829
I'm getting flashbang by the screen being open. So wait

766
01:28:58,189 --> 01:29:04,149
Well, hold on the next one is Square Enix at 12 15. What time is that what that's like?

767
01:29:04,149 --> 01:29:10,029
That's in like 45 minutes from now. Yeah, okay. So we've got a lot to talk about for 45 minutes a huge recap

768
01:29:10,029 --> 01:29:13,090
I actually I don't know if you wanted to keep talking about that

769
01:29:13,090 --> 01:29:17,750
I don't know if I'm interrupting but I know that like I was saying earlier, this is my this is my big break

770
01:29:17,750 --> 01:29:20,029
I don't normally have such

771
01:29:20,630 --> 01:29:25,430
High caliber celebrities on my stream and I'm kind of trying to make it as a journalist

772
01:29:25,430 --> 01:29:29,909
So I actually wrote up a bunch of interview questions for you and it would be an honor if you would allow me

773
01:29:30,350 --> 01:29:35,390
To interview you no. All right. So what did you think about?

774
01:29:35,909 --> 01:29:42,810
What do you what what do you think about me beating secure? Oh before you I didn't beat it at all

775
01:29:42,829 --> 01:29:45,850
So I don't really I don't think anything

776
01:29:47,609 --> 01:29:51,699
Congratulations, nobody said getting the sus guy is pretty big

777
01:29:51,899 --> 01:30:00,539
So what what was in that conference that you thought was that you were interested in?

778
01:30:02,460 --> 01:30:04,590
Babel

779
01:30:05,350 --> 01:30:10,630
All right, you wrote down you know replaced I wrote it down snowboard cameraman I wrote that down

780
01:30:10,630 --> 01:30:15,119
I wrote I don't know why I wrote that down. Why did you write among us? I just

781
01:30:16,319 --> 01:30:22,579
Sweeping the nation. So wait, what was the among us thing was that they they're adding more lobby slots

782
01:30:22,579 --> 01:30:27,229
Wait, so is it okay for you to interview me? I don't want to interview you

783
01:30:27,229 --> 01:30:31,149
I don't what you are you you are interviewing me. You're not a question

784
01:30:31,149 --> 01:30:35,390
I have what would I even ask you like I don't you just asked like three in a row

785
01:30:37,789 --> 01:30:40,750
But this it's we're talking about the games we just

786
01:30:41,149 --> 01:30:44,270
Watched not about like what you had for dinner last night

787
01:30:44,430 --> 01:30:50,579
that was not one of the questions, but you know, um, I like the camera the cameraman snowboard game could be funny because

788
01:30:51,060 --> 01:30:55,699
You know the laugh-out-loud moments of being able to take the camera and watch like you like snow snowboard down

789
01:30:55,699 --> 01:30:57,500
I don't know why it's you it's not gonna be you

790
01:30:57,500 --> 01:31:02,739
It's gonna be somebody else way more interesting than you but like it's gonna be filming somebody like a hilarious other streamer

791
01:31:02,979 --> 01:31:09,039
Going and like crashing and jumping over somebody and stuff. You know, I mean I need I need the

792
01:31:09,279 --> 01:31:10,399
old-person

793
01:31:10,399 --> 01:31:15,840
Recap, I'm like clicking to the stream what you didn't hear what I just said. No, no, I heard what you just said

794
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:18,680
I'm looking like what games they showed that I miss

795
01:31:19,300 --> 01:31:25,100
Understand because like there was a couple things that seemed interesting, but everything that seemed interesting had no gameplay

796
01:31:25,180 --> 01:31:29,100
Which is kind of typical e3. I'm curious about the arcane

797
01:31:29,500 --> 01:31:32,789
Studios because our game studios has never made a bad game

798
01:31:32,989 --> 01:31:38,630
But I don't know what they were showing because there was no gameplay. It's gonna be like

799
01:31:39,510 --> 01:31:43,630
Shooter four-player, that's very presumptuous of you. It's a

800
01:31:44,989 --> 01:31:51,520
You're jumping to conclusions here, Jerma, even if it's and I feel like you're not being fair to the developers

801
01:31:51,520 --> 01:31:55,699
I always try and give it there. All right, hold on. But what what what did you said arcane studios?

802
01:31:55,699 --> 01:31:59,220
What was the last thing they made?

803
01:31:59,460 --> 01:32:06,560
Prey was the last okay, so they make good games. Yeah, they make prey to make dishonored. Oh, okay

804
01:32:06,640 --> 01:32:10,720
So, yeah, they probably they're probably all right and they're they're making death loop

805
01:32:10,720 --> 01:32:13,279
But I think this would be the actually the first time that they have

806
01:32:14,090 --> 01:32:21,359
Made two games at once because I didn't expect a second game. Also Dark Messiah a very good game

807
01:32:21,359 --> 01:32:30,000
That is a very good game. I'm just kidding. Yeah, but if you want to play the snowboard game, I'll film you. Oh, okay

808
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:34,869
Yeah, no, okay. No, that's fine. I'll do the snowboarding you do the camera. Yeah, it was just kidding around

809
01:32:36,500 --> 01:32:40,340
Something for blood darkness. I might I would love to see another one of those wouldn't you?

810
01:32:40,460 --> 01:32:45,100
Yeah, I would love any I would like a heroes of might and magic game that

811
01:32:45,859 --> 01:32:51,359
Was the last one they even made they've made a bunch of them

812
01:32:51,720 --> 01:32:58,020
But even you just haven't heard of them because they were not very good. Why are you pretending to play games?

813
01:32:58,020 --> 01:33:00,380
I know that is what I'm doing cuz I don't

814
01:33:02,579 --> 01:33:06,939
I mean, there's 22,000 people here. I have to at least pretend like I fucking know what I'm doing

815
01:33:06,939 --> 01:33:09,890
I have to we have to say I have to sit with like a hand on my to be like

816
01:33:09,890 --> 01:33:17,380
Let me tell you something. That is not why people are here, right?

817
01:33:17,380 --> 01:33:23,899
You know if they wanted to go to Applebee's they just switch the channel you have to be comfortable

818
01:33:23,899 --> 01:33:30,680
Silence sometimes I am comfortable with silence. But did you see that? It was like a dust cloud that just went by the camera

819
01:33:30,680 --> 01:33:42,149
That was crazy. Uh, no, I don't have it open. We want the dump truck. We're here to see you. Oh, thanks

820
01:33:42,149 --> 01:33:53,079
No, thank you. Seriously. Thank you Applebee's Andy. You're looking cute today. You lost weight

821
01:33:53,220 --> 01:33:57,079
I've gained a lot of weight actually like a hundred and sixty

822
01:33:59,420 --> 01:34:04,340
Okay, too much weight. Oh, yeah, I haven't stood up on I haven't stood up on camera for a while

823
01:34:04,340 --> 01:34:10,569
I actually know that's versions of me have how it way that really like okay

824
01:34:10,569 --> 01:34:14,770
Jarvis short jokes, but to hear that you're you gained a ton of weight. You're 160

825
01:34:14,850 --> 01:34:20,489
We're going with this that math doesn't that's weird to me that you could be like, oh, yeah

826
01:34:20,489 --> 01:34:22,970
I'm up a whole bunch. I'm a hundred. That's like nothing

827
01:34:22,970 --> 01:34:30,529
I'm not I'm how short do you have to be for like I've gained a bunch of weight and you to be 160 pounds to be

828
01:34:30,529 --> 01:34:36,260
Like oh, it's not how it's getting bad. I'm five like eight, you know, how tall I am

829
01:34:36,300 --> 01:34:44,600
Why is this such a mystery? Well, that's I'm just saying that's the first time it has actually hit me as like I'm on board with this joke

830
01:34:45,779 --> 01:34:51,539
There is no job. I'm five eight and a hundred and sixty fat guy pounds. Like I need to lose

831
01:34:52,539 --> 01:34:54,539
160 cannot be fat

832
01:34:55,340 --> 01:35:00,619
Seven to five eight and I'm gonna say that range because it depends on what kind of shoes you have on if you have dress shoes

833
01:35:00,619 --> 01:35:02,619
On I become five eight and a half without

834
01:35:03,300 --> 01:35:08,020
You're a dwarf without dress shoes. I'm like five seven and two quarters or something

835
01:35:08,060 --> 01:35:15,529
I have to have dress shoes on my chat, which is scientists very intelligent people

836
01:35:15,529 --> 01:35:18,289
This guy's saying 160 at your height is perfectly healthy

837
01:35:18,850 --> 01:35:28,899
Are you always this down on yourself?

838
01:35:29,020 --> 01:35:33,850
If you have fucking dress shoes on you get a little taller

839
01:35:34,409 --> 01:35:37,420
Wait, how tall are you?

840
01:35:37,619 --> 01:35:43,220
Six two. Yeah, right. What do you mean? Yeah, right? You're like again. You've seen me

841
01:35:43,220 --> 01:35:46,430
Oh six one. You're like six feet on a good day

842
01:35:47,430 --> 01:35:53,189
By the way, who gives a shit about any of this? What did you think about the fucking fable conference?

843
01:35:53,189 --> 01:35:57,800
I think it was really cool that for about one second

844
01:35:57,800 --> 01:36:03,689
They showed a sword and apparently that sword is in fable. Yeah, we can we can we move on to something else?

845
01:36:03,689 --> 01:36:06,369
I mean, this is making me a little nervous talking about how tall I am

846
01:36:06,689 --> 01:36:10,960
What did you see the first conference? Did you see yesterday?

847
01:36:10,960 --> 01:36:15,380
I didn't we could watch yesterday's stuff cuz I haven't seen any of it. No, I've seen that shit

848
01:36:15,380 --> 01:36:18,279
It was fucking cool. Some of the stuff was cool. You really should check it out

849
01:36:18,439 --> 01:36:24,930
Yeah, I was going to wait because you were like, I'm only gonna stream on Sunday and I was like, oh, okay

850
01:36:24,930 --> 01:36:28,979
I'll just like I'll cue it all up for him

851
01:36:30,130 --> 01:36:37,729
And but this is this is what like all the big reveals are like Xbox the Xbox. No, that's when that typically happens

852
01:36:37,890 --> 01:36:50,500
They typically happen on the first day. Let me go take a break. I have to go to the bathroom. Um, yeah, when's the next one?

853
01:36:51,060 --> 01:36:52,500
well, 15

854
01:36:52,500 --> 01:36:57,300
12 15 we got a we have to kill a lot of time here. What are we gonna? What do we do?

855
01:36:59,039 --> 01:37:10,000
I don't know shit. How do I how do we kill like 30 minutes? This is like 45 minutes. I don't know ma'am

856
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:13,140
What can we even play?

857
01:37:14,640 --> 01:37:26,609
Among us. I'm not playing the minus. I'm not playing wait, you know what? No. No, it's the only time I'd ever play it

858
01:37:27,050 --> 01:37:31,750
It's a bit me and you what are we gonna? I who is the imposter you you killed me

859
01:37:31,930 --> 01:37:39,470
That's how you do it. The reason why I don't play among us and the reason why a lot I I'll give you the reason

860
01:37:39,789 --> 01:37:42,510
I don't I don't know like

861
01:37:43,189 --> 01:37:47,670
10 streamers to be like hey you guys ready to play among us. No, I don't I'm not gonna do that

862
01:37:47,829 --> 01:37:52,869
Well, then you're gonna get involved in the streamer drama. I know like four people

863
01:37:52,869 --> 01:38:09,729
I mean I could ask people on Twitter just ask people on Twitter what I don't like. Okay, here's thing

864
01:38:09,729 --> 01:38:11,170
I don't really want to play though

865
01:38:11,170 --> 01:38:15,810
I don't really like care that much about among us to like hit up a bunch of people and be like hey

866
01:38:15,810 --> 01:38:26,739
I want to play among us today. Can you and can I be in? Oh, yeah, that's another thing

867
01:38:26,779 --> 01:38:30,899
Talk about so I'm gonna I'm gonna be do it. I guess I'm talking about tomorrow

868
01:38:31,720 --> 01:38:33,600
I'm gonna be on

869
01:38:33,600 --> 01:38:41,250
OTK schooled you just making up letters. What? Oh, I'm gonna be I'm gonna be on schooled

870
01:38:41,250 --> 01:38:46,560
It's a it's a like a game show. Oh, check it out. It's a it's a it's gonna be fun

871
01:38:47,199 --> 01:38:51,380
It's a it's a game where you go through 12 grades

872
01:38:51,479 --> 01:38:57,199
You start it like kindergarten you go grade one grade two grade three and if you get three questions wrong, you're eliminated

873
01:38:57,779 --> 01:39:01,340
I hopefully I make it past the second grade. I really I'm very concerned

874
01:39:01,340 --> 01:39:06,680
I've actually been studying like the periodic table and like math and shit cuz I'm stood

875
01:39:06,680 --> 01:39:09,479
It's been like 20 years since I've been in a fucking classroom

876
01:39:09,720 --> 01:39:14,819
Yeah, when you're in school and you're young they don't teach you that you don't actually need to know any of it

877
01:39:14,819 --> 01:39:19,119
I really hope I get this past like the fifth grade or something

878
01:39:19,119 --> 01:39:25,239
I think is that's like okay, right getting to like the sixth grade in a game show at least it's like alright

879
01:39:25,720 --> 01:39:34,710
Seventh and eighth grade science questions are kind of they can be really specific, right? Yeah

880
01:39:34,710 --> 01:39:43,310
I do could you beat yourself, you know, you used to do the uh, what did they call it in school the

881
01:39:44,119 --> 01:39:51,340
The fitness awards and gym every year. Yep. They're gonna make you beat your like your times on the

882
01:39:52,619 --> 01:39:56,619
You can do never tell the story about how I tried to run the mile as fast as I could and I end up like

883
01:39:56,739 --> 01:39:59,979
Puking and they had to put me in a wheelchair and we and I had to go through like the halls in my school

884
01:40:00,380 --> 01:40:06,810
I haven't heard that no, I like I've told that story. Yes. Okay. I'm just making sure I've told it

885
01:40:06,930 --> 01:40:10,760
Okay, I was so desperate. I think you just told it again

886
01:40:10,760 --> 01:40:15,319
I did but like I just so badly wanted to I don't know why I just

887
01:40:15,899 --> 01:40:20,020
Decided I was gonna run the mile and try to get it as fast as I could or do it as best as I could

888
01:40:20,020 --> 01:40:23,619
And I think like six or seven minutes was oh wow

889
01:40:24,039 --> 01:40:27,720
You get your name written down in a book if you go like six or seven minutes

890
01:40:27,720 --> 01:40:30,880
And I was like I'm going for it and then I it was awful

891
01:40:30,880 --> 01:40:35,840
I felt awful. I wasn't really prepared for it. I ended up like puking behind a tree. I couldn't really walk

892
01:40:35,840 --> 01:40:42,659
I was so fucked up that the teacher like the phys ed teacher had put me in a wheelchair and I it was it was just awful

893
01:40:42,859 --> 01:40:45,380
But here's one thing I'm really good at in that shit

894
01:40:45,380 --> 01:40:50,899
You know the one where you sit down and you put your feet against the box and you have to put your arms out

895
01:40:50,899 --> 01:40:52,899
And go help them lean forward

896
01:40:53,659 --> 01:40:56,939
No, no, how far how far on the line you can put when you put your hands on top

897
01:40:56,939 --> 01:40:59,840
You guys know what I'm talking about the sit and reach. Yep. I am

898
01:41:00,399 --> 01:41:05,119
Reekishly good at the sit and reach because I have really long long arms and fingers and

899
01:41:05,880 --> 01:41:07,640
Like a really long body

900
01:41:07,640 --> 01:41:14,750
So I'm able to just like go like this and just I beat everybody's record when I was young

901
01:41:14,750 --> 01:41:21,970
I could do that position the reach I could put my nose on the ground. I can barely reach my knees now

902
01:41:21,970 --> 01:41:29,090
What happened put your nose on the ground wouldn't you know like if you put your feet out in front of you and like lean forward?

903
01:41:29,090 --> 01:41:37,989
Yeah, like I could stretch enough that I could put my face on the floor what yeah

904
01:41:39,840 --> 01:41:53,079
Yeah, what what what's the problem? Oh?

905
01:41:56,199 --> 01:42:08,369
Are you good? Oh, I see where this is going. I see I understand where this is going now

906
01:42:09,430 --> 01:42:11,920
You have sexual comedy

907
01:42:12,279 --> 01:42:19,159
Like what the fuck are you talking about you could seriously lean down you could put your face on the ground

908
01:42:19,159 --> 01:42:24,479
Is that what you're telling me? Yes. No you fucking no way. You know, what are you talking about?

909
01:42:26,500 --> 01:42:33,439
That's what I'm talking about you're telling me while you're sitting if you were Steve Wow back you could lean forward

910
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:39,000
All the way and have your face touch between your legs and hit the ground

911
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:47,689
Well, I mean like my body would go forward so like not like not like that close

912
01:42:47,689 --> 01:42:48,810
There's what you're talking about

913
01:42:48,810 --> 01:42:53,930
But yes, like if I leaned and tried to do the like touch your toes I could get my face to the ground

914
01:42:55,930 --> 01:43:00,729
I lived it

915
01:43:05,739 --> 01:43:09,680
Like okay, we gotta move on because I'm gonna get stuck on this

916
01:43:16,739 --> 01:43:23,439
Everything's fine. Everything's fine. I'm just I lived it. Are you jealous? No, I just can't

917
01:43:24,119 --> 01:43:30,279
Understand I can't believe that what you're describing is something that everybody says is impossible

918
01:43:31,039 --> 01:43:33,039
But the stop somehow

919
01:43:33,199 --> 01:43:36,000
You put your face on the ground between your legs

920
01:43:36,439 --> 01:43:43,479
Do you understand like how that's not even you make it doesn't make any sense what you're saying

921
01:43:45,159 --> 01:43:50,239
There's no way you were able to do that this no way you're able to do that this I don't believe it

922
01:43:50,239 --> 01:43:52,239
I I refuse to believe that's possible

923
01:43:52,640 --> 01:43:58,880
You could probably look up a Google like a video right now and react to it live on stream

924
01:43:58,880 --> 01:44:03,319
Like someone stretching and do it like I've seen videos of people doing crazier stuff than that

925
01:44:15,609 --> 01:44:19,380
Okay, do you not like those kinds of videos

926
01:44:20,100 --> 01:44:30,390
I think it's time we take a quick break and get a little bit of water refill some coffee and get prepared for the

927
01:44:30,390 --> 01:44:37,350
What's the next conference is coming up next Square Enix coming up next probably anime games and you know growing up

928
01:44:37,350 --> 01:44:40,949
I was just always told that people like, you know, yeah flexible boys. Oh

929
01:44:43,149 --> 01:44:51,020

932
01:45:17,430 --> 01:45:20,029
We thought like at some point you were like, oh, you know what?

933
01:45:20,029 --> 01:45:24,229
I'm gonna put like the actual like 18 plus on the channel and I'm gonna start saying swear words like damn

934
01:45:24,430 --> 01:45:30,430
There is there is a mature audience morning on this channel. Yeah, so why can't I talk about being flexible?

935
01:45:30,449 --> 01:45:36,079
It's it's it's the way you do things. You know what I mean? It's the way you do things

936
01:45:36,119 --> 01:45:44,199

939
01:46:06,520 --> 01:46:13,850
To be so say that one more time if you had to bleach one part of your body, what would it be?

01:46:52,050 --> 01:47:01,600
All right. Well, I don't I just I'm not gonna be here for like at least five minutes. Okay. Well, are you are you muting me?

948
01:47:01,600 --> 01:47:04,180

949
01:47:04,439 --> 01:47:10,060
Okay, just came out of my nose. I gotta go

950
01:47:10,380 --> 01:47:15,329
Alright and turn off your stream too. I don't want you to talk about me. Okay

953
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:34,970

954
01:47:35,609 --> 01:47:38,489
Well, I will be right back after these okay

955
01:47:38,489 --> 01:47:43,289
I want to say that this was also like second or third grade. So you're making it I okay

956
01:47:43,409 --> 01:47:51,279
Goodbye. Good fucking bye. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye. I'm going I'll bring it back. Goodbye. Oh my god

957
01:47:51,279 --> 01:48:02,300

958
01:48:02,300 --> 01:48:05,979
I'm out get back. Stop. Stop. Stop it. Stop. I'm out of here. I'm out of here

959
01:48:05,979 --> 01:48:34,899
I'll be back in five minutes. I need to unmute him cuz we didn't talk about this. I thought you were saying

960
01:48:35,279 --> 01:48:41,119
Yes, I was able to do that maneuver and go boy. I got I got that maneuver up there somewhere

961
01:48:41,159 --> 01:48:43,279
I thought you meant like you have that maneuver

962
01:48:43,279 --> 01:48:49,119
It's something that you like developed and be able to able to do when you were younger and it's like something you could still do

963
01:48:49,119 --> 01:48:50,199
I

964
01:48:50,199 --> 01:48:54,359
Specifically said I used to be able to do this and I can't even reach my own knees now

965
01:48:54,359 --> 01:48:59,720
I was I didn't even hear the second part of that sentence. Okay

966
01:48:59,720 --> 01:49:05,720
I think that you just have like a prejudice against me where you expect the things that I say to be things you don't want

967
01:49:05,720 --> 01:49:08,640
To hear and that you don't actually give me the floor to speak

968
01:49:09,560 --> 01:49:13,199
And you don't really consciously accept what I'm talking to you about

969
01:49:14,470 --> 01:49:16,470
I don't know my fucking like

970
01:49:16,829 --> 01:49:21,329
My brain thought that like this is so are you know? All right. Goodbye. I'll be back in five minutes
