00:00:06,519 --> 00:00:20,730
Hi. Hey, hi. Hey, hey, hi. What's up? Welcome back to another edition of Elden Ring.

2
00:00:24,949 --> 00:00:32,420
I'm late, yes. By a lot. Uh, I just, here's the thing. I'll tell you a secret. If you want to

3
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:38,659
hear a stream, a streamer's secret, this is a secret we all have. So I'm really kind of blowing up

4
00:00:38,659 --> 00:00:42,340
every streamer here when it comes to like blowing up there. Like, don't, don't say that we talk

5
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:48,820
mode. What are you talking about? So I'm kind of going to pull the rug out here. Streamers don't

6
00:00:48,820 --> 00:01:02,170
shit all day. Make sure everyone knows that. Some of them do. But for the most part, streamers

7
00:01:03,689 --> 00:01:11,099
pee. Oh, if you're a streamer, you got to make sure that you're empty before you turn the stream

8
00:01:11,099 --> 00:01:25,260
on. I don't think it really do explain why. Now, some people have this magic power where they can

9
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:30,700
just go to the bathroom and just, just go and be done in three minutes. I don't know how that's

10
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:42,299
possible. It takes me at minimum. Okay. I get in there a couple of minutes. Sit down, relax.

11
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:48,409
What about the phone? All right. What's my entertainment going to be for the next maybe

12
00:01:48,409 --> 00:01:55,370
five to 10 minutes? All right. I'm not ready yet. It's not there yet. You do it. You spit.

13
00:01:55,450 --> 00:02:00,090
You sit there for a little while. You have to clean up, right? Like it takes a long time.

14
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:17,849
It takes at least 10 to 20 minutes for me to go number two. Always. I hope you have more than one

15
00:02:17,849 --> 00:02:26,300
bathroom. I mean, I also have digestive problems too. And there he is. He just got you. And that's

16
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:36,780
how you know that now, now you've got to apologize to me. I'm telling you right now. All right. Those

17
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:42,810
of you that think that I want you to do me a favor the next time that you are going to go number two

18
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:46,409
and you're going to get surprised by this because people feel the same way. When you take a shower,

19
00:02:46,409 --> 00:02:50,729
people think the same thing. Oh man, I take like five minute showers. What are you talking about?

20
00:02:50,729 --> 00:02:54,889
No, dude, you're in there for 10 to 15 minutes. You just don't, your brain is not processing it

21
00:02:54,889 --> 00:02:58,969
because you're like alone in a fucking cube and you're just like in your own head for fucking 10

22
00:02:58,969 --> 00:03:06,469
minutes. When you go to the, when you take a number two next time, before you open the door

23
00:03:06,469 --> 00:03:12,310
to the bathroom, start a timer and then put it, put it away. Don't even look at it. Do what you

24
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:15,750
normally would do. And then I want, when you come out, I want you to look at it.

25
00:03:16,469 --> 00:03:20,150
And I wanted, I, I'm, I just, you're going to see it and you're going to go, all right, it's been,

26
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:23,990
all right, all right, all right, all right. It's been like 12 minutes. It's been like 15 minutes.

27
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:32,780
Okay. And then you're not, you got to come into the chat and you're not going to say anything.

28
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:35,259
You'd be like, Oh, hey man, what's the stream today? What do you, what do you stream today?

29
00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:43,509
Elden Ring? Oh, nice man. The thing is you actually should probably, here's the thing about

30
00:03:43,509 --> 00:03:48,500
showers. Timing your shower is really not a bad idea because you really can get just lost in your

31
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,939
head while you're sitting there, just scrubbing the same parts of your body. You've scrubbed like

32
00:03:51,939 --> 00:03:57,180
10 times already. I think like having like a five to 10 minute timer in the shower is good. It's a

33
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:04,870
good kind of like, all right, get the fuck out of there. Better for like, you know, water and stuff.

34
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:09,270
You don't want to waste too much water, but also just for the, for your routine for the day too.

35
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:19,180
You'd be surprised how long you're actually in there for. Yeah. And you got to dry too.

36
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:24,459
People think that the whole routine in the bathroom is five, 10 minutes. No, you got to dry,

37
00:04:24,459 --> 00:04:27,180
you've got to comb your hair. You've got to do your skincare routine,

38
00:04:27,899 --> 00:04:33,420
moisturizing, tooth brushing. It's like 40 minutes to an hour to do a morning routine.

39
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:40,920
Dude, I, dude, if I was like president of the world, I would sign like a presidential world

40
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:48,680
executive order that no, nothing was allowed to begin. Nothing. Didn't matter what it was before

41
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:53,959
9 a.m. Before 10 a.m. Like everything had to start at at least 9 a.m. At least,

42
00:04:56,149 --> 00:05:02,310
but that would kind of fuck up everything because there's like this stuff that like requires like

43
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:05,990
really early morning stuff. Like, okay, that would fuck up the entire world. Never mind.

44
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:13,699
You wouldn't know. No ambulances. No, no, no, no. It would be like specific industries.

45
00:05:13,699 --> 00:05:18,500
All right. What I just said was really stupid. Okay. That was stupid because if you make everything

46
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:24,579
have to start at 9 a.m., then what happens if something happens at 8 a.m.? What if there's like

47
00:05:24,579 --> 00:05:27,779
logistics that have to happen at like four, five, six o'clock in the morning somewhere?

48
00:05:28,339 --> 00:05:45,819
Speak for yourself. I'm a morning person. You are onto something there. What about time zones?

49
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:56,920
Nothing as president of the entire universe. Nothing is allowed to begin before I get up.

50
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:10,040
9 a.m. Pacific time. When I get up, that's when the world starts and we play the world.

51
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:18,180
We play the world anthem for me. My favorite song. Learn to fly by the Foo Fighters.

52
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:27,480
Everybody has to listen to it. All right. Let's go. We're going to Elden Ring again.

53
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:36,120
9 p.m. Start. You understand my point, though. It takes a lot longer than you think it does to

54
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:41,079
do a morning routine. And yeah, it's the afternoon. I know this wasn't a morning routine. I had other

55
00:06:41,079 --> 00:06:46,899
things I had to take care of in the morning. I got up at 9 a.m. Of course I did. I got up at 9 a.m.

56
00:06:46,899 --> 00:06:56,579
I did my taxes. I ran two miles. I ate a full breakfast with pretty much all vitamins covered.

57
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:03,660
I consulted for a few companies. I consulted for some people. Made a few bucks, you know,

58
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:09,339
consulting. And then I got in the shower. Then I took a shit. It took 45 minutes. Okay. So it

59
00:07:09,339 --> 00:07:13,180
takes me an hour to get my routine done of my cleansing routine. That's what I'm going to call

60
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:27,379
it. Hi. Dude, some people are just different. Yeah, I agree. Some people are just built differently,

61
00:07:27,379 --> 00:07:35,540
aren't they? I'm going to tell you, every single one of these Elden Ring streams is going to start

62
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:44,250
weird. This is the way it is. Every single Elden Ring stream is going to be a weird stream

63
00:07:44,889 --> 00:07:49,910
because it's equal parts me excited, equal parts me annoyed of me not being able to beat that last

64
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:56,069
boss, and equal parts me being happy that it's a thing that I'm happy playing. I don't think it's

65
00:07:56,069 --> 00:07:58,949
ever happened before. I would like somebody to figure this out. Someone that's been in the

66
00:07:58,949 --> 00:08:05,620
community for a long time. I don't think there's ever been a... I don't... I might break a personal

67
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:14,259
channel record here of games streamed in a row, time streamed in a row. I think we're about to

68
00:08:14,259 --> 00:08:31,350
break a channel record here. It's on the shirt. Dr. Pepper. 40 hour in a row. It would probably

69
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:37,779
be a little bit more than that after today. Dorsary was pretty long. I don't know if it was

70
00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:43,779
10 hours, 10 hours, 10 hours, 10 hours, 10 hours. Especially if I decide if I don't decide to take

71
00:08:43,779 --> 00:08:49,259
tomorrow off. You're talking about probably 50 to 60 hours in a row, which I've never ever done

72
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:58,919
ever since YouTube even like 10, 12 fucking years ago. All right, so last thing we did,

73
00:08:58,919 --> 00:09:03,159
I beat that boss in the academy. I got some cool stuff. We have leveled up a few times.

74
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:11,320
The Jedi game was long, but now I'm talking in a row, right? Like I'm talking in, you know, like

75
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:16,019
Monday 10 hours, Tuesday 10 hours, Wednesday 10 hours, Thursday 10 hours. Like I don't think

76
00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:25,610
I've ever done it. You already decided to take tomorrow off. Yes, and what... but here's the thing.

77
00:09:26,409 --> 00:09:33,740
Tomorrow is very relative. Tomorrow is incredibly relative term because it's 5 p.m. Pacific right

78
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:44,419
now, and I'm about to start playing Elden Ring. I might be streaming into tomorrow, if you know,

79
00:09:44,419 --> 00:09:50,009
if you understand what I'm saying here. Like if this is another 10 to 12 hour stream or something,

80
00:09:50,009 --> 00:09:56,710
I actually, I might be streaming like into tomorrow morning. So that's what I mean when I say take

81
00:09:56,710 --> 00:10:05,779
tomorrow off. The ominous music in the background. It's all relative. We'll see. Look, I'm fine. I'm

82
00:10:05,779 --> 00:10:14,659
fine. I've got matcha powder, which is a fucking superpower. I wish I was fucking around. I like

83
00:10:14,659 --> 00:10:21,850
really do. I'm not kidding. I'm not kidding. I've been drinking like matcha just like you have like

84
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:29,669
a matcha tea. Like when we start some like vitamins and stuff, I feel like fucking fantastic.

85
00:10:30,389 --> 00:10:38,710
This has been a long time since I felt like this after streaming. What about your kidneys?

86
00:10:39,269 --> 00:10:52,580
It's green tea. It's green tea. Is it? There's an item here. Wait, why is there? Didn't I pick this

87
00:10:52,580 --> 00:11:16,340
up? Okay. So I didn't pick this up somehow. Oh, cool. Why do I have to look? I just look like,

88
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:25,129
I look like, okay, I look like the witch from Snow White. Um, that's not going on,

89
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:36,629
although it looks kind of cool. Increases your health though. That's not bad. That's cool,

90
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:43,269
but not, not great. It's Captain Hook. We gotta, we have to stay with the Burger King because it

91
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:50,889
has the intelligence is just where it's at for me. The big bad wolf. That's what I was thinking

92
00:11:50,889 --> 00:11:57,019
of not. Well, it could be go either way. I'm thinking of all the characters I've seen in

93
00:11:57,019 --> 00:12:01,740
like Disney movies that like their nose goes like this and their chin goes like this almost

94
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:21,750
meeting in the middle. Okay. So let's go here. Goofy. All the witches in Disney are like,

95
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:27,509
they're like, oh, yes, my pretty. They have like, they have, they have beaks.

96
00:12:28,149 --> 00:12:41,129
All right. Where are we going? Uh, this is where I was last time.

97
00:12:41,129 --> 00:12:54,759
Doofenshmirtz. Doofenshmirtz. Doofenshmirtz. Yes, exactly. Oh, yes. Oh, well, there is the

98
00:12:54,759 --> 00:13:12,789
platypus, my pretty. Right? Like, what was that? What is this thing? All right. Headphones going

99
00:13:12,789 --> 00:13:17,029
in for this. I feel like this is going to be, what is, this is like a, oh, oh, look at the

100
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:49,750
beak on this one. You got a lot of health. Can I get behind you? Yeah. Oof. That didn't really do

101
00:13:49,750 --> 00:14:00,490
much. And that was a bad time to wind up like that. Are you susceptible to magic? Oh, that's a long

102
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:30,710
call. Dude, settle down. Wrong button. 155. Oh, that's a stagger. That thing, if you hit it twice

103
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:50,740
in a row. What? Land octopus ovary. Oh, okay. So this, I hit that twice and he, boom, got staggered.

104
00:14:51,379 --> 00:14:58,440
That's a really crazy enemy. This is, this reminds me of Bloodborne. This is like a Bloodborne enemy.

105
00:15:01,509 --> 00:15:07,690
Okay. So the last, we can take this off because I already have the key. The dragon's still there.

106
00:15:08,409 --> 00:15:21,460
Now here's the question. How come he can't do 3k damage every fight? Because that was, that enemy

107
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:32,950
was susceptible. Oh, give the key to that guy. Right. Where was that? Dummy. Over here, right?

108
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:46,419
Hopefully this isn't going to mess me up, but I'm going to give it to him. Are you still chasing me?

109
00:15:51,370 --> 00:16:01,940
Didn't he say, oh, if you end up finding a second key, bring it to me. Right. What does it say?

110
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:12,200
Key to the seals, binding both gates of the Academy of Raelucaria. Glenstone Key will remember its

111
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:18,039
user, meaning once used, it can never be passed on to another. The Academy does not welcome the

112
00:16:18,039 --> 00:16:28,649
indolent. Okay. I can't even give it to him. I can't, I can't give it to him. Well, I have

113
00:16:28,649 --> 00:16:36,519
to find another one. Sad. Oh, so we're not going to do that. Here's, I think I want to go this way.

114
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:43,740
We've gone way, way far up here on the, uh, the Western kind of like Northwestern side

115
00:16:44,539 --> 00:16:48,340
because I wanted to do the Academy to get the spells, which I did, which is cool.

116
00:16:49,139 --> 00:17:00,970
But now I think I want to go over here like this way because it's time to start like trekking this

117
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:04,970
way. And I probably can't, I got here way too early, but once I go through this section, maybe

118
00:17:05,609 --> 00:17:14,309
I'll be leveled enough to do this section. I think that's the play. That's where I'm going to go.

119
00:17:14,309 --> 00:17:16,809
So we're going to go down here. We're going to take this road here. We're going to start

120
00:17:16,809 --> 00:17:23,799
exploring this area here. And if anybody has a problem with that, then you can just leave.

121
00:17:23,799 --> 00:17:40,329
Well, we'll go here. Would you say that souls games are grindy? Well, it depends on how easy

122
00:17:40,329 --> 00:17:46,460
you want to make the game. Difficulty slider for souls games is how long you are willing to

123
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:49,579
grind souls to make your character stronger, to fight whatever you want.

124
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:57,500
So you, if you can really, really hunker down and really just desperately try to learn each

125
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:04,490
encounter of bosses in major places, then yeah, I mean, you could say you have to kind of grind a

126
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:10,009
little. I don't think that much though, to get to a point where you're capable of fighting something.

127
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:21,769
But I think that grinding souls is just your way to make the game a little easier for you.

128
00:18:22,859 --> 00:18:28,920
And there's nothing wrong with that. There really isn't. Don't let anybody tell you that,

129
00:18:30,119 --> 00:18:34,759
oh, you, you, you leveled up like three or four more times and like you went to fight the first

130
00:18:34,759 --> 00:18:43,720
boss. Casual. You have to be, you have to be clear. Not everybody wants to play the naked

131
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:52,859
guy with the club with zero stats. And the fact that some people do is like, holy shit,

132
00:18:56,740 --> 00:19:01,140
you're like really, really fucking incredibly talented and you have like an insane reaction time

133
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:06,619
and you're able to give yourself like an absurd challenge, right? Like a really, really big

134
00:19:06,619 --> 00:19:11,980
challenge. And that that's commendable. It is, that's awesome. But like people are just going

135
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:21,720
to play the game differently, right? Like it's, I mean, okay. If I were to level up like 50 times

136
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:27,640
before going to the first boss, then it's like, uh, you're going to kill them in like 10 swings.

137
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:32,019
At that point, it's like, all right, well, I mean, you kind of might be missing out on some

138
00:19:32,019 --> 00:19:39,589
of the fun of the game at that point. Like, yeah, I just went into the, uh, I went into the first

139
00:19:39,589 --> 00:19:46,069
boss area, um, level 80 and, uh, I can kill, um, I can kill Margaret and force swing.

140
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:51,349
That's like, yeah, that, that kind of maybe goes against like the, oh, these guys get off

141
00:19:52,230 --> 00:20:11,529
cool and calculated fall joke, man. Yeah. Stop monologuing at us. The point is don't be ashamed

142
00:20:11,529 --> 00:20:17,769
if you got to level up five, six more times before going to a boss. It's not a contest.

143
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:31,460
Well, the reason why that's encouraged in this game is because unlike other souls games,

144
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:37,910
doing that is not discouraged because there's so much shit to do in the main world. That's

145
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:44,710
not just linearly go to each boss. There's so many things to see that like going and like leveling

146
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:48,230
and grinding and other places and like finding new things to play and new bosses, little mini

147
00:20:48,230 --> 00:21:02,089
games and stuff. Oh, do it. No, don't how it makes me want to. So I got to, what's the deal with these

148
00:21:02,089 --> 00:21:16,039
guys that just, they just light up, but these guys turn red. You get to kind of get to figure

149
00:21:16,039 --> 00:21:52,619
out what that means. The music has changed though. Why is the music changed? It's like,

150
00:21:56,059 --> 00:22:05,990
have I been here before? I haven't been this way. I haven't been down. I've been here, but I don't,

151
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:17,670
let me just look down here and see if there's anything there. Yeah, this stuff, I didn't go

152
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:32,019
down this little river. I also like how everywhere those things are. Why is the horse not allowed

153
00:22:32,019 --> 00:22:37,990
here? Did I just get game mechanics spoiled of an encounter that's about to happen?

154
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:59,190
I got game mechanics spoiled. Bloody finger nary just what? How did that not hit him?

155
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:12,660
Dude, how can you faster than I am? Somebody bloody finger hunter is summoned. I got a buddy.

156
00:23:14,279 --> 00:23:28,069
Help me kill him. Get him. Get him. Nice parry. Who is this? Oh, I got to make sure he doesn't die.

157
00:23:28,869 --> 00:23:58,420
Yeah, fuck you invader. You're not even hurting him. Those dodges. Oh my God. I could feel that

158
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:12,250
guy's sweat dripping from his head from here. Oh, you're out of estus. Protect the caster,

159
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:32,500
protect the healer. Got him. So what was that all about? Reduvia with his accomplished goal,

160
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:50,099
bloody finger hunter Yura returned to his world. What was that? Is that a key item?

161
00:24:51,299 --> 00:25:11,369
What was that thing called? No, where is it? What the hell was that thing just called?

162
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:31,740
Arcane. This thing scales with arcane. This dagger rips the flesh as it enters, inflicting blood loss

163
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:43,240
with it. Yeah. Reduvia blood blade, slash with the wicked dagger, transforming its never drying

164
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:49,990
blood stains into airborne blood blades. I want to see what it looks like. That's pretty sick

165
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:57,240
looking though. There's a dagger and it scales with dex and arcane. That's really cool looking.

166
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:13,930
Let me see what the combat art is. What? Okay. This is awesome. I'm assuming that's the part

167
00:26:13,930 --> 00:26:27,799
that scales with arcane. This does bleed. It's got, that's a dagger with ranged. That's pretty

168
00:26:27,799 --> 00:26:38,099
amazing. All right. Well, that was a cool encounter. Why am I still red? I just am. I got a lot of blood

169
00:26:38,099 --> 00:26:43,220
in my face. There's blood all over my body. It's everywhere inside of me. Sometimes it goes up here.

170
00:26:43,779 --> 00:26:57,829
Let's keep going. Any other weird shit that I didn't see? What was the, where was the encounter?

171
00:26:57,829 --> 00:27:03,430
Where was that? Uh, that, that triggered when I went through. So here, I'll show you.

172
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:16,069
I walked through this kind of tunnel river area down here. So here from this, from the

173
00:27:16,069 --> 00:27:24,420
Mirkwater Coast bonfire, I went through here to the river and that started here. And I don't know

174
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:27,700
if it's guaranteed drop from that guy. It might be, maybe it's not. A lot of stuff in these games

175
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:37,160
is not. It took a 40 minute long shit. I didn't take a 40 minute long shit. I'm just saying my

176
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:55,910
routine to get cleaned up is like an hour. This is a dungeon. Mirkwater cave. We see like, okay,

177
00:27:55,910 --> 00:28:01,460
if you're getting your ass kicked by a boss and you just can't do it, it's so hard to pull it

178
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:08,490
because you want to get it done, right? It's the hardest thing to stop. Get out of there and like,

179
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:13,930
come down here. There's like so much more to the game than fighting the three phased boss

180
00:28:13,930 --> 00:28:34,180
encounter with 500 million HP. I think I want to, no, this is good for now. Maybe I should put on

181
00:28:34,180 --> 00:29:10,900
the starlight. What's that guy doing? What a weird patrol. I got to get my steps in. I can,

182
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:30,730
I can make sure that I could post about it. It didn't hit everybody. It should have. What the fuck

183
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:40,740
are you throwing at me? I thought this is where this thing is going to shine, man. And I have to

184
00:29:40,740 --> 00:30:08,019
get it. See? All right. That was weird. What is ringing that bell? I get, I need starlight.

185
00:30:08,019 --> 00:30:12,259
I can't see shit. I want starlight. I don't care if these guys respawn.

186
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:32,549
Cave moss? Mushroom. Five mushrooms. That was in the chest. Who puts five mushrooms in a treasure

187
00:30:32,549 --> 00:30:51,980
chest? That seems like what a waste of a chest. It's this shit. These bells. I need starlight.

188
00:30:54,259 --> 00:31:18,869
I'm running into bells, I think. Give me starlight. Um, where the fuck did I come from?

189
00:31:18,869 --> 00:31:38,650
Where did I come from? Where's my bonfire? Where am I? Over here? Oh, okay. I can't see shit.

190
00:31:39,450 --> 00:31:53,319
Oh, it is just a boss. All right. Well, nevermind. No object permanence. I couldn't see. Look, it's

191
00:31:55,019 --> 00:32:05,619
okay. Can you see in there? Fine. All right. Here we go. Here we go. Here we go. Here we go.

192
00:32:05,619 --> 00:32:36,869
What is in this room? We'll find out very shortly. Something's gonna crash through that.

193
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:50,680
Something's running around up there. It's giving me a little alien thing.

194
00:32:50,680 --> 00:34:07,829
Patches? Of course Patches is in this game. Patches. Yeah! Wait, please. Really? Okay.

195
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:15,159
So, Patches is in the game. I just had to turn the volume up a little bit and I'm terrified

196
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:19,800
that I'm gonna accidentally like back into the window of the game. Yep. Okay.

197
00:34:44,539 --> 00:34:49,719
I don't know. He's gonna do it again, right? He's absolutely gonna do it again.

198
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:02,059
Okay, so if some things can't be forgiven and we backstab him and kill him, we'll get something

199
00:35:02,059 --> 00:35:08,789
that he has on him. Whatever it is. Or give and forget means he becomes a vendor, which he might

200
00:35:08,789 --> 00:35:17,659
sell something useful and he also might show up later in the game. I'm curious.

201
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:30,340
Just what I'm tethered, like you, only free-spirited. Nothing, you might say. Only for now,

202
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:36,900
those retired soldiers turned bandits. Ah, they're paying for my gruel in exchange for my, well,

203
00:35:37,619 --> 00:35:43,300
showing them the ropes. Showing them the ropes. Honestly, this looting racket is bloody terrifying.

204
00:35:44,019 --> 00:35:51,050
Frankly, I'm ready to wash my hands clean. Maybe set up a legitimate shop. So don't be a stranger.

205
00:35:51,769 --> 00:36:02,739
Really? Yes! Somebody did it! Don't forget to pop back for another visit, friend.

206
00:36:02,739 --> 00:36:09,539
We're ready to wheel and deal. Come next time. Oh. Okay, so I gotta come back here and there'll be a,

207
00:36:09,539 --> 00:36:18,550
he'll have a shop here? All right, we gotta reload the area because I got, I mean, what do you got?

208
00:36:19,349 --> 00:36:26,519
You're where Patches is a reoccurring character. Oh yeah. He's always a dick. He always like,

209
00:36:26,599 --> 00:36:32,599
fucks with you. Um, he's always like a weird friend slash foe that always is an asshole.

210
00:36:33,159 --> 00:36:37,159
But he does, sometimes he can be kind of useful. If sometimes he can be kind of useful.

211
00:36:40,010 --> 00:36:48,469
Let's come right back. Just kill him. He's going to backstab you in the next Souls game.

212
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:57,690
Okay, so can I go back down here now? Do I have to pass time or will he just be like,

213
00:36:57,690 --> 00:37:05,559
can he just, can I just do it? What was with the bells? That was weird. Why, what, what,

214
00:37:06,039 --> 00:37:37,159
what the bells? Why all the bells? Just, it's just like an alarm system. Okay, easy. I mean,

215
00:37:37,159 --> 00:37:44,519
I want these. Okay, so is he here? There's another chest there.

216
00:37:44,519 --> 00:38:11,610
Okay, purchase. What do you got here? All right. Boost rune acquisition for a time. What?

217
00:38:12,329 --> 00:38:24,019
That's what that does? Market's shackle briefly binds market once imprisoned to earth.

218
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:44,730
What? Is this a way to make that fight easier? Ooh, you got a key. What? Okay.

219
00:38:45,530 --> 00:38:53,320
It's like gas coins music box. Okay. Well, that's where that is. Harrying dagger. That's what that

220
00:38:53,800 --> 00:39:00,840
is. Horse crest, wooden shield, sacrificial twig. Oh, this is if you die, um, you don't lose your

221
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:12,949
runes. I kind of want these. You're like, I need to go, I feel like going to that kind of farming

222
00:39:12,949 --> 00:39:21,800
zone that I was in before turning that on and just, I wonder how long it lasts. I should,

223
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:25,590
he also has sells one of these too. All right. What's in the chest? Let me ask him about the

224
00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:30,550
bands though. Maybe he's got something on your shopping list. No, no trouble to me. What's

225
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:35,699
going on? And it's make a clean break. Now they're all suppliers,

226
00:39:35,699 --> 00:39:42,409
no good ones at that. I mean, I understand a word I'm saying, but it hardly matters.

227
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:48,650
We have a natural connection. They're all foot soldiers, survivors of the defeated army

228
00:39:49,449 --> 00:39:54,650
work to the bone by their high and mighty Lord only to be thrown out with the rubbish.

229
00:39:55,449 --> 00:40:02,329
Ah, it's the same old story everywhere I go to hell with it. How does patches keep getting

230
00:40:02,329 --> 00:40:09,909
in every single universe? That's what I want to know that chest over there. Yep.

231
00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:21,590
What's inside the treasure chest? Well, it's nothing too special. You do something to me

232
00:40:21,590 --> 00:40:36,599
again. I'm going to be a trap. And besides this valuable customer could be a long time coming.

233
00:40:38,329 --> 00:40:43,289
Everything is given take. Yeah. Give and take. There's going to be a, there's going to be a

234
00:40:43,289 --> 00:40:48,010
bomb in there. Okay. So we might as well just open it so you guys can laugh at the

235
00:40:48,010 --> 00:40:51,769
fucking explosion that happens in my face. So we're like the poison gas. Here we go.

236
00:40:51,769 --> 00:41:05,539
Well, well, well, I should have known.

237
00:41:18,329 --> 00:41:36,710
Okay. Could have rolled away. He's just a cat. Where the fuck did you put me?

238
00:41:37,510 --> 00:42:18,730
Give me whatever that is. Well, that's got a huge arc map. Get it before I die. Stagger.

239
00:42:40,500 --> 00:43:05,659
Oh, damn. I got dead. I actually got the full charge. I actually got it.

240
00:43:06,630 --> 00:43:11,159
That was almost 800 damage. Damn. Okay. Cool. So where am I?

241
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:19,780
I'm great. East. This is exactly where I want it to go. You put me in the exact area I wanted to be

242
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:36,340
in. Thanks patches. You're a real friend. Let me get to a road though. There's a big, what's this

243
00:43:36,340 --> 00:44:00,179
big tree? Is that the, the Elden tree? Whatever the thing's called. Oh, what are the, what are

244
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:15,750
these? Are these just refill your flasks? I think these are flask refillers. Spiked cracked tier.

245
00:44:16,949 --> 00:44:25,769
Greenspill crystal tier. What's that? Temporarily boosts stamina in mixed

246
00:44:26,650 --> 00:44:31,050
physics. Enhances charge attacks for a time in mixed physics. What is, what is this

247
00:44:31,050 --> 00:44:45,449
physics thing? Unlock the rune you got from Godric please. What do you mean? Oh, this is a minor

248
00:44:45,449 --> 00:45:01,900
elder tree. That's a refillable potion. Really? I have to go to a tower to unlock it. Oh. Well,

249
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:09,429
I don't know that yet. Spoiled me. Actually, I did know that. All right. This is kind of an ocean

250
00:45:09,429 --> 00:45:21,019
here. Minor urd tree. Why is that on here? There's a reason why that's here, right? It's on the map.

251
00:45:21,820 --> 00:45:36,170
What? Like a dungeon? Or is it just, hey, here's one of them. That looks like I can get in there,

252
00:45:36,170 --> 00:45:59,420
doesn't it? That looks like I can get in there. Oh, what's this? An observatory. Whoa. Where am I?

253
00:45:59,420 --> 00:46:10,199
What the fuck? This game is fucking insane. This is crazy. That is this much as random shit for you

254
00:46:10,199 --> 00:46:50,550
just to go do. I need a, okay. Is there a fire down here? I hope so. Find out. What the fuck?

255
00:46:50,550 --> 00:47:01,590
This is such a huge elevator. How long is this ride? My head would have exploded from the

256
00:47:01,590 --> 00:47:45,289
underwater pressure by now. See you for a river. Well, we got one. Okay. I don't have enough to

257
00:47:45,289 --> 00:47:52,019
level up. Um, I think my flasks are okay. I think five and two is fine. Let's take a look.

258
00:47:53,380 --> 00:48:43,320
What's this shit? Okay. Well, there's a summoning statue thing here. Oh, okay. Rune. We're calling

259
00:48:43,320 --> 00:49:05,019
finger. I might just sell a lot of the PVP stuff and all the items don't know. Stone unturned

260
00:49:05,019 --> 00:49:34,340
silver firefly, which is also new. No stone unturned ruins. All right. Where's the, where's the,

261
00:49:34,340 --> 00:49:39,369
where's the guy that's going to be around the corner with like a giant? Yeah. The casters,

262
00:49:47,699 --> 00:49:55,579
they look like casters. Those are stale. Those are staves. Those are staves. These casters,

263
00:50:04,949 --> 00:50:08,150
they casters and not, they just have shiny things. All right, let's go.

264
00:50:08,949 --> 00:50:43,059
We know how to deal with groups. You're in slow motion. We know how to deal with groups. Not bad.

265
00:50:43,059 --> 00:51:16,099
Immune to that. What the fuck was that hit box, hum? These guys do not get staggered really.

266
00:51:17,219 --> 00:51:48,489
It's so slow. It's so weird. That takes care of that. Rune probably. Oh, nice. I need a five

267
00:51:48,489 --> 00:52:03,699
somber stone, right? What is that? Oh my God. It's like a shining thing up there.

268
00:52:04,340 --> 00:52:16,869
That's like a hyper item. Look up. What do you want me to look up for? Why is there a Riddler?

269
00:52:16,869 --> 00:52:27,940
Why is the Riddler here? Oh no, it's a golden centipede. There's nothing. Stop. I don't know

270
00:52:27,940 --> 00:52:42,869
what you're talking about. Runes. I wonder if I can just like, do these guys have any brains at all?

271
00:52:42,869 --> 00:53:01,860
Probably not. They're so slow. Yeah, all right. Look up. Look up. Look up. It's structure and

272
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:14,199
bones and material and shit. What do you want? It's mountains. It's this like, it's like a sky

273
00:53:14,199 --> 00:53:21,269
with rocks and wood. All right. I'm not looking up anymore. I'm not getting baited like over

274
00:53:21,269 --> 00:54:55,190
and over again. Hurts a lot. Exploded. That was definitely it. No. Stop. These guys hit so hard

275
00:54:55,190 --> 00:55:06,969
and they're just so slow. You're in slow motion. You make me angry. All right. What does that thing

276
00:55:06,969 --> 00:55:17,539
do? I think it's just a big AOE. I can't really get behind him. So we're just going to have to.

277
00:55:19,929 --> 00:55:38,519
Those go. No, I can't pull them. So it's not, I don't even need to try.

278
00:55:44,070 --> 00:55:59,880
Immunizing cured meat. Oh, I want to do this. Why can I backstab him?

279
00:56:01,769 --> 00:56:14,969
Rainbow stones. Those things that make it so you can don't get lost.

280
00:56:15,929 --> 00:56:25,289
Which in this game, they actually might be very useful. Unlike previous games where it really

281
00:56:25,289 --> 00:56:35,800
kind of didn't matter that much. Previous games, those little pebbles or pool, but

282
00:56:36,599 --> 00:56:55,579
you're like in a game like this, they're way more helpful. What does it, what are the,

283
00:56:55,579 --> 00:57:01,079
wow, there's so many people over here. For what? There are a shitload of you here. Is

284
00:57:01,079 --> 00:57:08,840
there something here? I'm just going to, I'm not going to fight these guys.

285
00:57:10,199 --> 00:57:26,820
Is there an item? I don't see an item. Mushrooms. Just chilling. Yeah. I don't see anything else.

286
00:57:27,380 --> 00:57:30,179
I think that's just kind of, you don't have to go through the front door. Unless it's something

287
00:57:30,179 --> 00:57:40,969
there, the glowing, I don't see it. No, I think that's just all their steps. There's nothing here.

288
00:57:40,969 --> 00:57:51,210
Okay. Well, let's get going. Do I have scarlet rod? I don't believe so.

289
00:57:51,929 --> 00:58:06,260
Wouldn't that be on the screen? What about over here? Yep. Item right there.

290
00:58:07,139 --> 00:58:11,670
Game's too dark. Turn up the brightness. I think that's intentional.

291
00:58:15,190 --> 00:58:22,099
I think I was going to see you back here. Did you? No, kill it. Please. No, kill it.

292
00:58:24,389 --> 00:58:39,579
I thought it was going to be an item. Okay. Right here.

293
00:58:40,300 --> 00:58:53,820
Utting horn. I have to sit down and craft. I have my, I have like five backpacks full of stuff that

294
00:58:53,820 --> 00:59:27,610
I haven't even opened. So this is probably a boss door. Big waterfall. Interesting. Oh, ghost

295
00:59:27,610 --> 00:59:36,519
glove wart. That's really important. I could probably go through the waterfall. It's definitely

296
00:59:36,519 --> 00:59:47,539
like a secret thing to go through. Dude, I'm sorry. I'm not going to like pick up an item over here

297
00:59:47,539 --> 01:00:28,840
and have 10 of you get up and kill me. Backstabbing takes too long. Just kill him. Damn it. Come here.

298
01:00:35,449 --> 01:00:52,809
That thing is good, but they just have so much health. Clayman's harpoon? These people have made

299
01:00:52,809 --> 01:01:08,869
it to clay? Clayman's harpoon. What else here, right? I want to see what that is.

300
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:22,630
Int scaling? Harpoon with a tip made from a sharpened meteorite shard built by the claymen

301
01:01:22,630 --> 01:01:45,400
who infest dynastic remains. Blade emits a faint light and deals magic damage. That's cool. So

302
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:54,090
that's like a magic damage thrust. That's actually really good. Another ink weapon. That's awesome.

303
01:01:54,090 --> 01:02:00,920
All right. I'm not going to get rid of this in case I need it for something. Okay. Let me put my

304
01:02:00,920 --> 01:02:04,840
other weapon on the one I'm actually going to use. Now I'm fat rolling, so that's going to hurt.

305
01:02:04,840 --> 01:02:20,309
I think stone. The phone's got to go back in. Let's go. All right. There's no way there's not

306
01:02:20,309 --> 01:02:30,869
something in the waterfall, right? Impossible. When has there ever been a video game? Soap.

307
01:02:31,510 --> 01:03:07,400
Is there soap in the waterfall? What the fuck? Is it a crafting material? Soap removes filth

308
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:19,739
and accumulations on the body. What? Filth covering the exterior eventually seeps into soap. If you

309
01:03:19,739 --> 01:03:33,670
get dirty of this. Okay. Filth is in the game. I imagine that's poison buildup. Maybe. All right.

310
01:03:33,670 --> 01:03:41,849
Well, here's the big door. It's time to find out what's going on here. Although I might want to

311
01:03:41,849 --> 01:03:46,329
not do this yet because I have a lot of runes. I can probably level up before I get killed by whatever

312
01:03:46,329 --> 01:03:57,219
the enemy is up here. Those guys are so slow. It'd be so easy to get back here.

313
01:04:00,500 --> 01:04:22,460
I think it's time to be a coward. Yeah. Time to be a coward. Coward time. I have way. Oh yeah. I

314
01:04:22,460 --> 01:04:37,340
could definitely level up in these like 11,000. One of these will do it. Actually maybe three of

315
01:04:37,340 --> 01:05:20,869
them and eight, a little more. Is that was enough? It's probably 11 or 12. 13. 13. What? And then

316
01:05:20,869 --> 01:05:32,360
one more of these. Look at that perfect calculation. 13, one nine six. I will have

317
01:05:32,360 --> 01:06:22,340
zero souls left. Kill these guys and that's it. That's a huge knockback too.

318
01:06:30,329 --> 01:06:38,920
All right. Let's go. Level up. Kill one of these guys with your eyes closed. Fine. Ready?

319
01:06:40,969 --> 01:07:05,260
What do I want to put the point into? Mind probably I said, right? Mind. Yes, I do.

320
01:07:05,260 --> 01:07:14,119
20. Mind gets us our friend Oleg finally. You can do wield the spheres.

321
01:07:14,840 --> 01:07:23,880
Actually pretty crazy. All right. We'll be good. I got two, one. We'll see. We need to upgrade the

322
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:30,739
boys. I actually was talking to Holly last night. I was like, man, I really don't know what to do

323
01:07:30,739 --> 01:07:35,460
because like if I don't get the boys to plus 10, everyone's going to be fucking pissed. And like

324
01:07:36,099 --> 01:07:39,780
they're going to be mad at me for not doing that. But what if like Oleg's not that good? And what

325
01:07:40,099 --> 01:07:44,389
if that is the right play? I was like, I don't know. I wonder what I should do.

326
01:07:45,269 --> 01:07:53,380
Like if I don't upgrade the boys to at least like plus five and I'll never hear the end of it.

327
01:07:53,380 --> 01:08:08,340
There'll be like a meme on the channel for like another three years. Can I get up here?

328
01:08:08,980 --> 01:08:12,420
Just look at that. There's like a huge, there's like a giant sparkling item over there.

329
01:08:15,619 --> 01:08:21,260
I can definitely get up there from here. Absolutely. No doubt in my mind.

330
01:08:21,899 --> 01:08:36,550
Oh, can I, maybe I can. That was just the earth exploding sound from rapidly.

331
01:08:42,140 --> 01:09:04,229
It was actually that sound. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Not bad. He's going to explode.

332
01:09:04,229 --> 01:09:15,350
Do it.

333
01:09:18,789 --> 01:09:55,880
Watch out for the little bubbles. All right. What happened? Okay. Throwing dagger. Now wait,

334
01:09:59,289 --> 01:10:06,180
dropping down here gets me that. Oh, okay. I gotta be careful. There's a ledge here though.

335
01:10:06,659 --> 01:10:16,250
Wait, I'm not done exploring because there's no air to go over here too. God. All right.

336
01:10:16,250 --> 01:10:49,420
Can I make that jump? I can't make this jump. Wait, what was the point of that?

337
01:10:49,420 --> 01:11:00,699
Nothing over here. Really? Why would they have a jump here?

338
01:11:04,550 --> 01:11:24,329
Oh, come on. Really? No, it's gotta be something. I guess not. So let's drop here. Right there.

339
01:11:24,970 --> 01:11:43,380
Okay. I gotta be careful. Oh, the bubbles. That's the bubble spell.

340
01:11:46,250 --> 01:11:58,939
Bubble spell. That thing looked like it was a piece of shit though. I need arcane. There's

341
01:11:58,939 --> 01:12:02,220
several small magical bubbles that drift towards foes before they naturally pop.

342
01:12:03,020 --> 01:12:19,779
I'm not going to do arcane. That's cool. Um, I wonder if I should be putting any points into

343
01:12:19,779 --> 01:12:32,500
arcane at all. How come this, wait, why the runes respond? The items respond down here?

344
01:12:33,060 --> 01:12:42,859
Did I just not pick that one up? Will Diablo four be the Elden Ring of Diablo two? No,

345
01:12:47,289 --> 01:12:57,590
not. I don't think a chance in hell. I'm sorry if I'm honest. Arcane is luck.

346
01:13:10,460 --> 01:13:16,060
Look up, Jermo. Look up. Whoa, what the fuck? It's like there's an arc here. This is one of

347
01:13:16,060 --> 01:13:38,439
these like arc building. Is that a map? How far am I going here? I'm going like, where am I? Okay.

348
01:13:38,439 --> 01:14:11,460
There's bugs here. Just checking. You never know. Reserving ballaces. Holy fuck. Sorcery falls off

349
01:14:11,460 --> 01:14:17,979
hard later on. Well, that's what I'm saying. That's why I got to make sure I'm prepared

350
01:14:17,979 --> 01:14:23,020
and that I have enough like decks and other shit. And I have like an int scaling weapon

351
01:14:23,579 --> 01:14:27,659
like this to make sure that I can complete the video game. And those people that were saying

352
01:14:28,539 --> 01:14:36,310
that I'm a, I'm a noob. I saw a bunch of people called me noobs, I thought. And it was not making

353
01:14:36,310 --> 01:14:42,390
me happy. And I'm giving you the reason why. Oh, I had a dream. This is perfect. Okay. Perfect

354
01:14:42,390 --> 01:14:48,949
opportunity. I had a dream last night. Let me explain this. So in the dream, I was like walking

355
01:14:48,949 --> 01:14:53,430
around, I think it was like my like apartment or my house, whatever. Like I was just in like an

356
01:14:53,430 --> 01:15:02,310
apartment or something. And it was this little crab like this, tiny, tiny, tiny. And it was just,

357
01:15:02,310 --> 01:15:08,859
it was as big as I would say, not as big as a tarantula, but a lot bigger than a house spider.

358
01:15:09,500 --> 01:15:18,779
It was like, it was as big as a crab. So this was a crab, like a small crab. And it was just kind

359
01:15:18,779 --> 01:15:23,979
of walking around little, just like walking around and it had like a, like a, what looked like a stick

360
01:15:24,539 --> 01:15:30,569
in its hand. It had this long, like almost sharpened stick. And it was just kind of like

361
01:15:30,569 --> 01:15:36,649
walking around holding it. And there was like a little tiny little shield that was, I would say

362
01:15:36,729 --> 01:15:42,090
maybe a foot or two away from where the crab was. So it's holding like a little sharpened stick,

363
01:15:42,090 --> 01:15:45,850
walking around. And there was like three or four other people in this house. And we were like,

364
01:15:45,850 --> 01:15:49,369
what the fuck's going on here? Holy shit. You see what's in your house. I don't think we were in my

365
01:15:49,369 --> 01:15:52,649
place. We were in somebody else's. I don't even know who these people were. So it's like, dude,

366
01:15:52,649 --> 01:15:57,369
what the fuck is going on? This crazy. And this crab comes, kind of goes over it, picks up this

367
01:15:57,369 --> 01:16:01,289
little tiny shield. It's like, what's going on? This is like, get a camera, somebody get a fucking

368
01:16:01,289 --> 01:16:09,770
camera or something. And then like the distance was another little crab that had the same items.

369
01:16:11,289 --> 01:16:15,529
And they like started to go towards each other. And it was like, what the fuck they're going to

370
01:16:15,529 --> 01:16:19,689
fight. They're going to like, this is going to be like a sword fight. They get close enough

371
01:16:19,689 --> 01:16:25,930
where they just barely start to like whack at each other. And I don't know if this is like the

372
01:16:25,930 --> 01:16:32,170
person's dog that owned this place, but this big golden retriever just like runs over and like,

373
01:16:33,210 --> 01:16:37,369
starts like fucking biting and like biting them and shit and freaking out. And the whole house was

374
01:16:37,369 --> 01:16:42,729
like, whoa, whoa, whoa, no, no, no, no, no, get the dog, get the dog. Like it sprinted over and

375
01:16:42,729 --> 01:16:46,569
started to like go after them. Like kind of sniff, bite, bite, sniff, sniff. Like it was like,

376
01:16:46,569 --> 01:16:50,250
you know how dogs are, right? It's just something like a little bug or something sometimes. And it

377
01:16:50,250 --> 01:16:56,569
was like, get the dog. What the fuck is happening? It was chaos. It was absolute chaos. Like this

378
01:16:56,569 --> 01:17:02,010
golden retriever like literally was not even in my field of view. And it like slid into frame,

379
01:17:02,010 --> 01:17:08,489
like it's pause. It was like, it just started freaking out. And it was like such panic and such

380
01:17:08,489 --> 01:17:13,050
chaos because it was like, I don't, but they have like sharpened stuff. We don't want the dog to get

381
01:17:13,050 --> 01:17:17,609
fucking hurt. Like we don't, I didn't even know you had a dog. Like it was crazy. It was, and then I

382
01:17:17,609 --> 01:17:39,989
woke up. It was just absolute mayhem for like five seconds. And then I woke up. Somebody said,

383
01:17:40,630 --> 01:17:53,210
dude, you have, why are you having viral video dreams? Yeah. That's just like something crazy.

384
01:17:53,210 --> 01:18:01,210
That would be like on like TikTok for 10 seconds. Oh dude. There's like this weird bug here.

385
01:18:02,010 --> 01:18:11,300
Dog runs in. No, no, no, no. Only in my version they had weapons. So it was scarier.

386
01:18:12,020 --> 01:18:21,960
You're having Zoomer humor dreams. Yeah. Cause everybody kept was like yelling,

387
01:18:21,960 --> 01:18:26,760
no, put it down, drop it, drop it. Like, don't do that. And I think, I think he like was just,

388
01:18:26,760 --> 01:18:29,479
I don't know. I couldn't even tell what was happening. It was just chaos.

389
01:18:37,449 --> 01:18:43,640
Oh, it was so weird. Like they were going to go fight each other. Like I think it was because

390
01:18:43,640 --> 01:18:49,380
of the crabs in the game. Don't ask me why. Like I had, I mean, I, I know why I had like a dark

391
01:18:49,380 --> 01:19:07,859
souls dream. This one's way more aggressive. Yeah. I know why I'm having like weird, like

392
01:19:07,859 --> 01:19:13,159
sword and shield dark souls dreams. It's because of this. Don't ask me where the golden retriever

393
01:19:13,159 --> 01:19:22,779
came from. And it was one of those golden retrievers that was like super big and a little

394
01:19:22,779 --> 01:19:29,739
chunky tons of hair. Like that, like kind of that golden hair. It was that kind of chunky and like

395
01:19:29,739 --> 01:19:50,630
big crab eggs. All right. So what is going on over here? This is, this is kind of, this is a

396
01:19:50,630 --> 01:20:16,579
long little area. No map, which cause it's a dungeon. Why would there be a map? Okay. Map

397
01:20:16,579 --> 01:20:26,250
right there. See ask and ye shall receive. God, what the hell is this? Wait, why? There's a map

398
01:20:26,250 --> 01:20:56,649
down here. How big is this place? There's another bonfire. This is ridiculous. Okay. So where the

399
01:20:56,649 --> 01:21:12,140
hell am I? How did I, I don't even know how I got here. Light the flame. Hey, that's not a map.

400
01:21:18,520 --> 01:21:29,750
Maybe I have to light up a bunch of beacons or something. Okay. Well nevermind. All right. We

401
01:21:29,750 --> 01:21:44,729
got this way, that way, that way. I'm going to go this way. This place is huge. Let's go left.

402
01:21:45,529 --> 01:21:54,699
That's not funny what you just did. It's annoying. I know that like Elden Ring, all the From Software

403
01:21:54,699 --> 01:21:58,220
games are there. They're pure comedy games. What you just did didn't make me laugh. It made me angry.

404
01:21:58,939 --> 01:22:07,430
Get away from me. What the? All right. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Who is this?

405
01:22:08,229 --> 01:22:18,789
This guy doesn't seem to care. I'm waiting for you to get out of the way. Is this like an NPC?

406
01:22:18,789 --> 01:22:41,460
Why does this guy not care that I'm here? Barbarian? Okay. That guy was just collecting

407
01:22:41,460 --> 01:22:44,819
babies. Why did you? Get away. Just leave me alone. I don't want to fight that thing.

408
01:22:48,039 --> 01:23:19,029
Oh, it's a, it's a fun. Come here. Maybe it'll eat out of my hand. Long wind up. I got long winds

409
01:23:19,029 --> 01:23:28,729
ups. I'm back against a tree. Get rid of it. I'm looking up his ass.

410
01:23:30,600 --> 01:23:34,199
Camera's just pointed directly in his ass. Like get me the fuck away from him.

411
01:24:15,479 --> 01:24:47,449
Okay. I'm glad I did that. Okay. Like how many fucking times in a row do these guys swing?

412
01:24:52,920 --> 01:24:59,399
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10. Okay. Now play the game. Now fight me.

413
01:24:59,399 --> 01:25:25,449
I want to kill this thing so bad. Now fuck you. You just, you're just, you're just in the fucking

414
01:25:25,449 --> 01:25:34,710
way. These crabs, seriously. It's like, why are there so many crabs in Elden Ring? There's,

415
01:25:34,710 --> 01:25:41,770
there's huge crabs everywhere. They're in every area. We're down in like this downtown magical

416
01:25:41,770 --> 01:26:09,590
fucking like Disney, like Hades area. And there are this seafood here. What? Okay. Get off the

417
01:26:09,590 --> 01:26:18,039
horse. I'm not, I'm, let's go. Give me a break. Not playing around here. There's a guy over,

418
01:26:18,039 --> 01:26:27,750
I got collapsed on. That's what happened. So let's not get collapsed on. And there he is. Okay. So

419
01:26:27,750 --> 01:26:51,800
this is, this is a problem. There. Mad because crab. Mad because crab. Mad because crab.

420
01:26:52,520 --> 01:27:05,850
There's crabs everywhere. They, they might just spawn. Maybe they just show up.

421
01:27:08,060 --> 01:27:30,390
They do. Okay. I was wondering like, what the fuck is happening? Oh, there's a beacon here.

422
01:27:31,109 --> 01:27:48,340
Get out of the way. It's whatever you are at this too. I wish you could pet the animals.

423
01:27:48,899 --> 01:27:57,850
Don't you think that'd be kind of funny if you could like, who's that? Like if you could go up

424
01:27:57,850 --> 01:28:14,859
and just be like, and they gave you plus one resolve. Okay. So that got that one and got this

425
01:28:14,859 --> 01:28:24,199
one. I'm going to go the right side now. They're boys. You're a genuine American pleb. I was going

426
01:28:24,199 --> 01:28:36,100
to say warthog, but pig was less syllables and I was angry. So that's why I said it early.

427
01:28:37,460 --> 01:29:29,460
Okay. Stop picking your nose and play. We got over here. Hey, armorers cookbook.

428
01:29:32,300 --> 01:29:41,300
Look at this. This is, this is ridiculous. Uh, like am I ever going to sit down and craft a single

429
01:29:41,300 --> 01:29:51,989
item in elder? I have 117 of these. I have, I mean, what am I doing? Look at all these cookbooks.

430
01:29:56,229 --> 01:30:10,250
I'm not even doing it. Just make soap from all of them. You're holding it just in case.

431
01:30:10,250 --> 01:30:20,170
That's kind of what it feels like. I've already been, I've been, I've been down there, right?

432
01:30:20,890 --> 01:30:39,109
I don't know. Have I, that's where I started, right? Yeah. So I got these fires lit that one.

433
01:30:39,109 --> 01:30:43,109
I've got the one on the left. We're going to go right and see if I can't. And actually, you know,

434
01:30:43,109 --> 01:30:47,720
let's rest at the balloon file because I don't care about those enemies over there responding.

435
01:30:47,720 --> 01:31:03,020
Why do I care? All right, let's go like the one on the right and craft from the pause menu.

436
01:31:07,800 --> 01:31:21,670
Um, blood loss. I can make, I can make 12 of these temporarily boost fire damage negation. I can make

437
01:31:23,939 --> 01:31:37,859
four of these. I can make fire pots. What's even useful to make a cloud. What would even be useful?

438
01:31:37,859 --> 01:31:47,670
Maybe this like, maybe this would be useful at some point. Maybe one of these fire. Yeah. Like

439
01:31:47,670 --> 01:31:56,859
this is just, you cook, but can I even cope my weapon? Cause it's magic. Use the cookbooks.

440
01:31:59,739 --> 01:32:18,039
I use them for my, my inventory. I can't use them from here. I have to turn them in. I think

441
01:32:18,039 --> 01:32:23,880
that is there. It is auto. Okay. Well, I, I don't, I don't care. Okay. None of that stuff really is

442
01:32:23,880 --> 01:32:28,819
pressing for me to do right now. Look, if I fight a boss and it's like, Oh wait, they're susceptible

443
01:32:28,819 --> 01:32:33,619
to fire damage. And by the way, they do fire damage. Watch out. I can just like, I'll make like

444
01:32:33,619 --> 01:32:55,739
a hundred of them. Why is there another game underneath the game? They made Elden ring. And

445
01:32:55,739 --> 01:33:00,619
then they said, Oh, you know what? Um, yeah, we should make like a whole nother video game.

446
01:33:00,619 --> 01:33:03,420
We're out of room on the map though. That's okay. Just put the whole thing underground.

447
01:33:04,149 --> 01:33:07,750
There'd have to be two levels, like one under sea level, like whole entire video game. And then

448
01:33:07,750 --> 01:33:12,149
one above sea level. How did they make this? How did they make this game? Do they have like

449
01:33:12,149 --> 01:33:19,579
12,000 employees? How does this possible? They hid dark souls four in Elden ring.

450
01:33:21,989 --> 01:33:24,869
Imagine like an announcement like that. Oh, by the way, I just want to let everybody know.

451
01:33:25,430 --> 01:33:32,789
Uh, we actually made dark souls four and it's, we made it below sea level in Elden ring. So yeah,

452
01:33:32,789 --> 01:33:35,750
there's like a whole other story down here. Uh, it's not, it's just optional. If you don't,

453
01:33:35,750 --> 01:33:41,079
if you don't have to do it, who cares? Jesus. All right. I don't want to fight all these guys.

454
01:33:41,079 --> 01:33:58,699
I just want the item, which there is just material leaf inverted Hawk heater shield.

455
01:33:58,699 --> 01:34:05,579
That's definitely an anti-fire shield. Okay. Cool. I spent the item. There's no, uh, fire over here.

456
01:34:07,029 --> 01:34:41,300
Very cool. The aggro. Okay. Um, I want to, he's not behind me, right? He is. He's coming.

457
01:34:41,939 --> 01:34:47,619
He's got a bow. Will he shoot the ball or will he despawn? Leave me alone. I think I'm far enough

458
01:34:47,619 --> 01:35:06,060
away. Why are you so annoying today? I'm annoying every day. Um, okay. He's gone. I've been using

459
01:35:06,060 --> 01:35:13,529
this for, I don't think I need to use this one anymore. Medium sized metal shield easier to

460
01:35:13,529 --> 01:35:18,760
handle than a kite shield. Inverted Hawk is an emblem of the company of slaves order to explore

461
01:35:18,760 --> 01:35:28,810
the eternal city. And it's Perry. How is it different from anything else though? A hundred,

462
01:35:28,810 --> 01:35:34,729
a hundred. It's a little more fire and a little more lightning, but that's big of a deal considering

463
01:35:34,729 --> 01:35:41,800
that this is 58. This is not that great for fire or lightning, which I'm imagining. We're probably

464
01:35:41,800 --> 01:35:48,220
not in the magic area right now, so maybe I'll just put it on. This is the best I have for fire

465
01:35:48,220 --> 01:36:01,300
besides this, but I can't wear this or maybe it's lightning. We'll find out. All right, let's keep

466
01:36:01,300 --> 01:36:31,750
going. Halloween grounds. Hollow horn. What is that? Is that a statue or is that, is that alive?

467
01:36:36,470 --> 01:36:57,529
This thing is definitely alive and maybe it's not. I have, okay, I got a theory. My theory is

468
01:36:57,529 --> 01:37:03,930
you light all the fires and then you come back up here and it stands up and then you fight it.

469
01:37:05,340 --> 01:37:16,039
That's the theory I'm going with, so that's what we're doing. Yeah, yep, look at this. Yeah,

470
01:37:16,039 --> 01:37:22,920
one, two, how many are there? I lit two. One, two, three, four, five, there's six more to light?

471
01:37:23,880 --> 01:37:38,630
If it goes by that theory, then damn. All right, well, we got a lot to look at for that stuff to

472
01:37:38,630 --> 01:38:02,619
light. Oh, goodbye. I see a fire over there. Your aim is unmatched and it annoys me. Oh,

473
01:38:02,619 --> 01:38:19,159
there's a Mario thing. There's a Mario 64 thing. Let's try it. Whoa. I've never used one of these.

474
01:38:19,159 --> 01:38:25,560
What? How does this work? What happened? I've never used one. What was that?

475
01:38:26,439 --> 01:38:43,180
That just was fucking stupid. I didn't think it was going to go that high. That was too high.

476
01:38:43,180 --> 01:38:51,529
You were facing the wrong way. I mean, I thought that those things were automatic.

477
01:38:52,090 --> 01:38:55,960
I thought it was like, oh, go here, hit jump and it will put you, so I didn't think I had to like

478
01:38:55,960 --> 01:39:21,930
actually steer the thing. Like I was on a wingsuit. Your urinal activated. I thought it hit me in

479
01:39:21,930 --> 01:39:35,609
real life. I felt that it hit me in real life. Okay. So how does this work? Watch out. Watch out.

480
01:39:35,609 --> 01:39:55,109
Watch out. Watch out. Be careful. Be careful. No, you're going too close to the edge. Be careful.

481
01:39:58,310 --> 01:40:04,949
Oh my God. That was horrible. Okay. That would have been so sad, but I think everybody would have

482
01:40:04,949 --> 01:40:32,149
laughed. I would have been one of them. How do I activate this? Jump. Dude, this is ridiculous.

483
01:40:32,149 --> 01:40:43,619
We're, I'm in like another dimension. Glove wart. Yep. The more glove wart I get, the more that

484
01:40:43,619 --> 01:41:00,100
there's a chance that the boys get to plus 10. It's just seeing if there's something down there

485
01:41:00,100 --> 01:41:16,039
that might be whatever. That's for play through number two. What was the point? Nice. Actually

486
01:41:16,039 --> 01:41:56,090
worth the binoculars in this game. Where are they? It's an invisible bridge. Oh, I'm sure there is.

487
01:41:57,779 --> 01:42:00,739
Oh, it's an invisible bridge. Thanks guys. I appreciate the help.

488
01:42:02,630 --> 01:42:08,489
Like it's an invisible bridge. You can walk over this. That's a great, really good idea. That's

489
01:42:08,489 --> 01:42:19,210
very funny. Uh, even if it's true, I don't believe you. I fucking can't believe I live. Why would I

490
01:42:19,210 --> 01:42:30,739
do that? I can't believe it. I figured like maybe everyone just spoiled that for me and like, okay,

491
01:42:30,739 --> 01:42:41,619
whatever, we'll just go. Everybody in this chat needs to understand if I didn't do that for the

492
01:42:41,619 --> 01:42:46,500
next 40 straight minutes, as long as it takes me to clean up in the morning, right? We would be

493
01:42:46,500 --> 01:42:53,300
hearing back to the bridge, back to the bridge. Oh, bridge, bridge boys, uh, rise up bridge crew.

494
01:42:53,300 --> 01:42:56,500
Hey, invisible bridge crew. That would have been, it would have been like an hour.

495
01:42:57,300 --> 01:43:11,380
So I'm just getting in front of that. Uh, I have to go back up there. Don't kill me.

496
01:43:13,989 --> 01:43:20,760
It's your voice. Oh, bridge crew shot an arrow like five minutes ago and it actually ended up

497
01:43:20,760 --> 01:43:31,210
hitting me. But how do I get in the middle? Okay. I'm going to do something really weird here.

498
01:43:32,010 --> 01:43:45,829
How do I get down from here? How am I supposed to get down? I want to try to go in the middle

499
01:43:45,829 --> 01:43:55,220
area with as an item. I jump into this jumping into the stream of air. So, I mean, theoretically

500
01:43:55,220 --> 01:44:03,079
that should work, right? But it might not try it. Wait, I can't get back over there.

501
01:44:03,079 --> 01:44:12,779
How do I get home? How am I going to get back? I jump over there. Holy fuck. I almost didn't.

502
01:44:12,779 --> 01:44:23,659
All right. So I want to go in the middle. This is not going to work.

503
01:44:33,800 --> 01:44:57,239
Where am I going? I'm fine. What? I just want to go like this. My own head.

504
01:44:57,239 --> 01:45:10,170
I was literally on purpose. It was on purpose because I purposefully thought that I could make

505
01:45:10,170 --> 01:45:16,090
it down there without dying. It was on purpose. It was purpose behind it. You've got that. You've

506
01:45:16,090 --> 01:45:35,020
got that first part, right? Okay. Where are they? Are they up there? Where's the fucking up there?

507
01:45:35,020 --> 01:45:40,380
Why do they have to be up there? Oh my God. The game just ran forward and I just like freaking

508
01:45:40,380 --> 01:45:49,210
freaked out. But I actually have to jump up there. That's annoying that it should be where

509
01:45:49,210 --> 01:46:14,020
you land, not where you jump from. Okay. Let's try this now. Is that a person? It looks like a

510
01:46:14,020 --> 01:46:20,859
guy with a cloak on. All right. Let me see if I can get in there from here. That's gonna kill

511
01:46:20,859 --> 01:46:27,619
you, right? I want to, let's see. I have, this is going to be such a pain in the ass. Can I get in

512
01:46:27,619 --> 01:46:32,020
there from here? If I just jump and then move forward at the very last second, I'm saying like,

513
01:46:33,260 --> 01:46:43,130
no, wait, what if I do this? Wait, what's the jump? I couldn't jump. Why could I not double jump?

514
01:46:44,010 --> 01:46:53,539
I was trying to double jump into that. I didn't get my second, I didn't get the jump.

515
01:46:55,699 --> 01:47:00,819
I was going to fall, jump, like double jumping in the middle. You fell. You didn't jump. You

516
01:47:00,819 --> 01:47:12,539
can do it still. You can only double jump after jumping. What? You have to jump to double jump.

517
01:47:13,100 --> 01:47:18,539
Really though? Do I, I feel like I've done that before a few times. Hold on. Let me prove chat

518
01:47:18,539 --> 01:47:41,699
wrong. Wrong, by the way. Wrong, by the way. Debunked. Why are you joke farming? I want to

519
01:47:41,699 --> 01:48:00,699
get in there. I'm not farming jokes. I'm farming items and souls in the game. Sometimes I wish I

520
01:48:00,699 --> 01:48:16,149
could just jump and like Yoshi this horse and like get further. Can I jump from the other side?

521
01:48:17,029 --> 01:48:24,949
Find out. Is there a ledge like here or something that I can get on?

522
01:48:25,829 --> 01:48:40,390
It kind of looks like it. What about here? All right. What happens if I do this?

523
01:48:41,109 --> 01:49:20,869
Get off the horse. This is going to be a nightmare. Okay. Wait, I might have to jump. Remind me to

524
01:49:20,869 --> 01:49:32,060
check that if I need to. Oh shit. I need to jump from the horse. I have to horse jump over there.

525
01:49:40,310 --> 01:49:50,180
Too far? I know I got a horse jump over there. That's the only way I could have dropped. Wait,

526
01:49:50,180 --> 01:50:07,270
what? No, it is the only way, isn't it? It's so funny. That would have been fucking hilarious

527
01:50:08,069 --> 01:50:16,979
because I would have missed it and freaked out because it was right here. All right. There it

528
01:50:16,979 --> 01:50:23,220
is. So what all this time and all this energy, what was it for? Oh, cool. Like bone arrows with

529
01:50:23,220 --> 01:50:41,659
fucking goo on them. I'm glad I did all that. But there might be more. It's not. Now somebody that

530
01:50:41,659 --> 01:51:11,739
is playing an archer build might go, holy shit. Nice. But that's not me. I'm going to go that way.

531
01:51:12,630 --> 01:51:17,189
Can I skip that? If I just go there and jump across the whole thing, does that work?

532
01:51:17,189 --> 01:51:20,470
I would imagine it does. And I'm probably going to get laughed at when it doesn't.

533
01:51:21,109 --> 01:51:34,939
I mean, it might work. No, it's not going to work. And then why would I do that? I can literally go

534
01:51:34,939 --> 01:51:53,430
right here. Okay. Some eagles just hanging up. I don't think so. I'm going to horse this time.

535
01:51:53,430 --> 01:52:14,710
Idiot. Are there's another fire? Nice pop in. Oh, great pop in gameplay.

536
01:52:20,789 --> 01:52:25,989
All right. Well, dude, all right. I'm this is ridiculous. There's so many people here.

537
01:52:26,789 --> 01:52:34,779
How am I supposed to handle this? This is ridiculous. What? There's no way.

538
01:52:35,819 --> 01:52:48,939
I think I just have to get off and run. It's going to be worth a lot of souls if I can kill it.

539
01:52:51,029 --> 01:53:20,420
And you have magicians too. So there's magicians, axe wielders, sorcerers. Take out the archers

540
01:53:20,420 --> 01:53:49,699
first. Anybody that has like magic can get rid of them too. Nice entrance. What happened to my horse?

541
01:53:49,859 --> 01:54:03,449
What happened? What? They like staggered the horse. Why are there like 15 of you here?

542
01:54:03,449 --> 01:54:12,939
That was going really well. It was until like somebody just and like somebody hits the

543
01:54:12,939 --> 01:54:38,390
fucking horse's leg and then you get the gong sound and you fall down. Just I'm just going up

544
01:54:38,390 --> 01:55:14,760
there and doing it. Is there really a need to fight like 30 people here? Okay. All right.

545
01:55:14,760 --> 01:55:31,859
That's that one. I'll wrap around this edge. You piece of shit. Where are you doing that?

546
01:55:32,579 --> 01:55:45,210
Okay. Give me a second. Should I pull these out? I don't know where that's coming from,

547
01:55:45,210 --> 01:56:10,500
but I need to kind of know before I start moving. Okay. Yeah. It's a guy. Somebody in a tree shooting

548
01:56:10,500 --> 01:56:24,520
me with these arrows. Where the fuck is this person? Like I was, I didn't even know. I couldn't

549
01:56:24,520 --> 01:56:41,590
see him. Sniper on the hill. All right. Nice. Minecraft arrows run towards the arrow. That's

550
01:56:41,590 --> 01:56:46,039
a good idea. I don't, I don't even know where the guy was and he could have been behind me

551
01:56:46,039 --> 01:57:06,340
for all I knew. Okay. So where I died, this is the bullshit here. That's where that was. Okay.

552
01:57:06,340 --> 01:57:35,819
Let's get this. Get my body. What was that? Fuck you guys. Why? Get out of the way. You stupid

553
01:57:35,819 --> 01:57:51,130
animal. Get out of the way. Where are my souls? There. Hey, all right. Not stupid animal. Okay.

554
01:57:51,130 --> 01:58:01,189
All right. I know. That was rude. I have to get off the horse and just like fight people,

555
01:58:01,189 --> 01:58:08,569
right? Because like they're going to keep doing this shit. I mean, or like honest to God, like

556
01:58:08,569 --> 01:58:16,659
what the fuck, man? Just fight them. Like they're not going to stop. They're going to keep spawning

557
01:58:16,659 --> 01:58:34,819
on you until you've had it. There's another one right here. Okay. Sure. Did that come back?

558
01:58:35,460 --> 01:58:40,520
Is that just like a defense mechanism for the tower? I don't, that's probably going to hurt a

559
01:58:40,520 --> 01:59:02,920
lot. That one, this one, I'm going to just do a big circle because just do the perimeter.

560
01:59:02,920 --> 01:59:14,810
There's probably another one or two around the perimeter. It's bonfire there, which is good.

561
01:59:14,810 --> 01:59:35,420
This is so huge. All right. Bonfire. That's good. Take it. You see the clip of you twerking

562
01:59:35,420 --> 01:59:53,060
during the VR stream. I lived it. I can go up there, but I'm into the, I'm trying to light

563
01:59:53,060 --> 01:59:57,460
these fires here. So we're going to light the fires and blink a bunch of times because my

564
01:59:57,460 --> 02:00:11,670
eyes need to be moisturized. I'm looking for fires. There's something all the way down here,

565
02:00:11,670 --> 02:00:21,079
but I think this might be going too far. I think that's too far. I don't think they would put them

566
02:00:21,079 --> 02:00:49,050
that far away. Although what the hell do I know? That's a backstab if I ever say that.

567
02:01:24,859 --> 02:01:28,699
I'm going to assume there's probably one or two more down this way and then we can go

568
02:01:29,739 --> 02:01:34,539
fight that boss in the middle. That it's probably optional, but let's do it. Why not?

569
02:01:46,659 --> 02:02:06,260
I probably have enough to upgrade my weapon. We'll see. It feels like you're the baddie because

570
02:02:06,260 --> 02:02:18,409
those monsters are just living peacefully with the wildlife. I love it. I live in like games

571
02:02:18,409 --> 02:02:46,600
and like media play, but like your moral compass. It's kind of true though. It's a very,

572
02:02:46,600 --> 02:02:52,739
it's a very pretty area. Somebody tried to hit me with a barrel. Sounded like it.

573
02:02:58,359 --> 02:03:14,180
What is over there? We had some weird shit over there. Runes, waterfall. Oh,

574
02:03:26,569 --> 02:03:46,180
oh, it's one of those weird beat snake animal features. Um, patches here. I just was setting

575
02:03:46,180 --> 02:03:51,220
up shop. If you need anything, don't hesitate. Hell, you're a scoundrel, aren't you? I think

576
02:03:51,220 --> 02:04:12,550
I'll see you later. Playing music. All right. Do, do patches right now in your room, wherever you

577
02:04:12,550 --> 02:04:20,090
are and just tell me, and you're going to say, ah, that's Dewey Griffin. And that wasn't even

578
02:04:20,090 --> 02:04:23,210
close to being Stuart Griffin. All right. I'm just going to, this is weird. There's a, somebody

579
02:04:23,210 --> 02:05:02,199
playing music. I'm very interested. Whoa. Is that a bow and arrow that he's playing? I'm not going

580
02:05:02,199 --> 02:05:26,779
to interrupt the song. Book, bunch of cookbooks. Oh man. He's got, look at all the keys he has.

581
02:05:29,689 --> 02:05:40,039
I want those and I'll get this too. Really cool. Do I have anything that's expensive

582
02:05:40,039 --> 02:05:54,300
that I just don't give a shit about? Not really. Maybe some of the weapons. Well, we know I'm not

583
02:05:54,300 --> 02:06:01,210
using the, uh, sword sword. This is not going to happen. I'm not going to use this dagger.

584
02:06:02,010 --> 02:06:06,090
No, I have the cool daggers if I ever wanted to use it for any reason. Uh, I'm not going to use,

585
02:06:06,090 --> 02:06:11,369
wait, what if I dual welded it? Could be this thing. No, it's faith. I'm sorry. It's 500 souls.

586
02:06:11,369 --> 02:06:19,560
Goodbye. All right. Same thing with these crossbows. No, I'm not going to use them.

587
02:06:20,199 --> 02:06:26,569
I'll keep that just because it's fun to have. Uh, some of these shields might be good in certain

588
02:06:26,569 --> 02:06:33,380
situations. Let's see. Yeah. They, I, you don't never throw away armor ever because it just

589
02:06:33,380 --> 02:06:37,140
randomly has use that you just don't know about. In fact, I got a couple of new things I want to

590
02:06:37,140 --> 02:06:58,090
look at, although I don't need to. Okay. How do you pronounce wield like that? Wield.

591
02:07:04,789 --> 02:07:11,750
Okay. So I can afford, I'm just going to come back and buy the other key.

592
02:07:12,310 --> 02:07:48,420
Like this is, that's, those are cheap. Those are really cheap. Um, I was seeing if anything was

593
02:07:48,420 --> 02:08:05,260
behind him. I'm not fighting that. I just looking for the thing to turn on, which there was one over

594
02:08:05,260 --> 02:08:23,220
here. I missed, didn't I? Oh yes. Oh, you've come to the right place. You need only unravel its

595
02:08:23,220 --> 02:08:30,859
mysteries. It wasn't outside. I like yourself to begin. That's my favorite character in every

596
02:08:30,859 --> 02:08:36,550
souls game. By the way, I wish they gave that guy way more screen time. I love that guy.

597
02:08:42,859 --> 02:09:12,539
He needed it five times more screen time. That one right there until wait, buying those tears

598
02:09:12,539 --> 02:09:19,079
will let you upgrade the blast. Really? Are you bullshitting me? Are you shitting me for content?

599
02:09:32,149 --> 02:09:39,619
Should be one more. Is that actually, is that true? Cause I'll go back up there because my

600
02:09:39,619 --> 02:09:49,930
flask is only at a plus one, which is sounds like it's probably terrible right now. Get out of here.

601
02:09:49,930 --> 02:10:04,199
Tears are for respect. Is it, can I, let me go look at it. That's it. All signed and sealed.

602
02:10:04,840 --> 02:10:11,340
I don't know. Whatever happens, you may think at all of me bad.

603
02:10:19,939 --> 02:10:32,619
All right. Hey dude, I'm back and I want to ask you a quick question about the, how are the,

604
02:10:32,619 --> 02:10:46,710
what are those tears do material needed by Rinala to grant rebirth? You lied to me.

605
02:10:47,670 --> 02:11:11,699
Look up. It's nothing here. Different tears for flasks. Yeah. You guys, you guys had,

606
02:11:12,500 --> 02:11:21,399
now we've got to run through like the weird thing over here. No, turn around. Damn it. It's too

607
02:11:21,399 --> 02:11:27,180
late. It's not too late. I'm going back up there and I'll tell you why I'm going to crack a crunchy

608
02:11:27,180 --> 02:11:35,430
because I want to buy that other key. I just forgot about it right there. And then please don't

609
02:11:35,510 --> 02:12:10,260
fucking kill me. Like don't look up. That tear lets you rebirth and change stats with the moon

610
02:12:10,260 --> 02:12:27,960
lady. Yeah. Why does he move around in the game? Like a panicked bug. Yeah. Let's see how you move

611
02:12:27,960 --> 02:12:32,699
around when you're playing. Cause I'll tell you right now, if you are not sitting there like this

612
02:12:36,470 --> 02:12:56,729
the whole time you play, then hypocrite Andy, when a guy appears behind you, if you, okay,

613
02:12:56,729 --> 02:13:01,850
if I walk down this way and I don't know what's to my left and a guy jumps out and attacks me

614
02:13:01,850 --> 02:13:05,130
and I don't know he's there and it's a surprise, I'm not going to go like this.

615
02:13:16,170 --> 02:13:20,869
No, you're going to go like this. Even if you tried it, you're going to go,

616
02:13:23,579 --> 02:13:27,020
yo, what the right. And then like everyone in the early friends are going to laugh

617
02:13:27,739 --> 02:13:40,699
or you're at least going to go or you guys act like you have like balls of steel. Like you're just

618
02:13:40,699 --> 02:13:56,810
like nothing ever makes me emote ever. I am like a stone, nothing. My courage precedes me

619
02:13:58,359 --> 02:14:14,619
always, always customer. The reason why I'm buying these is because they're the cheapest I've seen

620
02:14:15,739 --> 02:14:21,609
everywhere else. These are four or 5,000 gold. They're two. This guy's, this guy's very reasonable.

621
02:14:21,609 --> 02:14:26,890
Next time I just say, I like this guy. I actually want to meet up with this guy again. I want to,

622
02:14:26,890 --> 02:14:30,010
I want to be friends with this person. I don't want to just show up right here. That's,

623
02:14:30,010 --> 02:14:40,779
that's a good price. That's a good price. I respect that guy. All right. Looking for the last,

624
02:14:41,500 --> 02:14:53,899
I think there's only one more dollars gold. Yeah, but it's a spendable currency. I'm going to call

625
02:14:53,899 --> 02:15:00,659
it like money, right? I'm going to call it money because it's just, it's money, whatever. It's

626
02:15:00,659 --> 02:15:12,439
money that you can use to up to spend on yourself. Okay. It turns out I was right because are they

627
02:15:12,439 --> 02:15:22,939
all lit? No, two more need to be lit. Got to find those last two straight up the middle.

628
02:15:22,939 --> 02:15:37,500
Maybe it is for a little bit further out. Oh God. I'm not going in there yet. Not yet.

629
02:15:42,420 --> 02:16:15,189
Turtles. There are two more. Oh, oh, I sensed it. It probably, you shouldn't even be shooting at me

630
02:16:15,189 --> 02:16:21,180
by now. How do you still have sight? How does this person still have sight on me? They're across the

631
02:16:21,180 --> 02:16:27,539
rest. They're across the whole game. You're literally, you're across the entire map. You're

632
02:16:27,539 --> 02:16:45,430
across the entire zone. Stop running in a straight line. I'm running a straight line because I feel

633
02:16:45,430 --> 02:17:01,940
like I'm far enough away where the guy can't shoot me with the born arrow, buddy. Wait, why is that

634
02:17:01,940 --> 02:17:13,860
one of these here? Buddy. He's fuming. No, I'm fine. I'm just kidding. I think it actually is further

635
02:17:13,860 --> 02:17:46,309
down. Like it's probably down here. Oh, there's two more. Let's continue. Thank you.

636
02:17:54,920 --> 02:18:48,299
They glitched out. Are they stuck? Maybe stuck. That move actually is pretty good because with

637
02:18:48,299 --> 02:18:59,239
more dexterity, that's going to be even faster. So I actually don't hate that move. What are they

638
02:18:59,239 --> 02:19:17,899
doing? I wonder why they're doing that. Okay. Well, I got to get that. They're stomping. But why?

639
02:19:18,780 --> 02:19:38,309
There's probably a reason why they're doing that. I don't want to get too overzealous and run off

640
02:19:38,309 --> 02:19:52,379
the edge. Ash Fores square off. Another teleporter. Let's mark it. Those are the teleporters marked on

641
02:19:52,379 --> 02:20:07,340
the map. They're not. They are not marked on the map. Okay. What's this place called? The river.

642
02:20:07,899 --> 02:20:29,209
What's this place called? I got to clean this up. Uh, this guy, we already did this. I already did

643
02:20:29,209 --> 02:20:38,940
this. Wrong guy. Still hates me. All right. What about C? What's the CEO? Sofra? What's this place

644
02:20:38,940 --> 02:21:06,120
called? What's the place? Sofra village. Okay. Sofra has two teleporters. Okay. I'm not going

645
02:21:06,120 --> 02:21:13,190
to go in them now because I'm busy. I am what you would call very busy because I only have two more

646
02:21:13,190 --> 02:21:17,610
of these and then it's definitely a boss we fight. So sorry, we're not going in there and I have to

647
02:21:17,610 --> 02:21:28,409
pee too. So I'm doing that before the fight as well. These guys are like, Oh, there's rats.

648
02:21:29,049 --> 02:22:15,620
Why are they just hanging out with them? Stop panic dodging before I scream. All right. Here's

649
02:22:15,620 --> 02:22:25,139
the, there's one more after this. I want to check this out over here though. There's a place I can

650
02:22:25,139 --> 02:22:39,190
go up here. Is that it? There it is. That's the last one. I think we keep going this way though,

651
02:22:39,190 --> 02:22:43,670
just for now, because there's a little ending over here. This is a little like observatory

652
02:22:43,670 --> 02:22:58,309
or something. I don't know if they're going to shoot fucking arrow at me. So that's why I'm

653
02:22:58,309 --> 02:23:20,020
freaking out. What the hell are those? Why are the, why were the sheeps rolling? Were they rolling

654
02:23:20,020 --> 02:23:50,389
around? That was weird. Why would they go, why are they doing that? Sheep do that? It's got an item.

655
02:23:51,430 --> 02:24:08,260
Golden rune and a rune arc on a rat. Holy shit. Was it worth killing then? What's up there?

656
02:24:09,059 --> 02:24:28,950
Okay. We're, we're at this ending here. The fire. This is another boss right here.

657
02:24:31,450 --> 02:24:38,899
It's all underground. Yeah, that's ridiculous. Okay. Well, there's definitely something right

658
02:24:38,899 --> 02:24:45,579
here. Why would there not be, right? That's has to be a boss. Yeah. I can see like the lantern

659
02:24:45,579 --> 02:24:51,750
whatever it is. All right. Let's go up there. We need to look down. Now we're doing look down spam.

660
02:24:52,549 --> 02:25:48,489
Pretty. Really pretty. Two triangles. What's, what's the big deal? We're camp abandoned. Okay.

661
02:25:48,489 --> 02:26:09,979
What is up? Yes. Let's check it out. Here we go. Clarifying horn charm. I have a third slot.

662
02:26:09,979 --> 02:26:22,729
Raises focus. Wait. Oh, should I get the focus? What does that, what does that mean?

663
02:26:23,530 --> 02:26:43,750
Where's this focus? Is that mana? Oh, what is focus in this game? Resistance to sleep

664
02:26:43,750 --> 02:26:46,709
and bouts of madness. I already have a lot of that from intelligence, right?

665
02:26:47,829 --> 02:26:52,090
That's kind of cool. All right. So what is it? What do you got? Who is it?

666
02:26:59,430 --> 02:27:11,750
Can't go down here unless I spend the stone keys. Okay. I don't think I want to do that.

667
02:27:12,549 --> 02:27:19,190
I don't think I want to do that. I will mark this though, because this is actually, I know

668
02:27:19,190 --> 02:27:53,129
where that is. I'll just, I'll make a note of it though. It's not worth it. Well, I will see.

669
02:27:56,010 --> 02:27:59,690
I'm not going to put it in because I have a few places I'd like to check out first. All right.

670
02:27:59,690 --> 02:28:07,610
So there's that. That's cool. Let's actually go because that, yeah, because now I got to,

671
02:28:07,610 --> 02:28:49,659
I got to light the last one. That last fire was back this way. All right. Is he aiming at

672
02:28:49,659 --> 02:29:20,950
me? I think still actually turns out this thing is really good for stuff like this.

673
02:29:21,750 --> 02:29:47,110
Cool. I got my flask filled up too. Thanks. All right. Final thing. Light it up. Here we go.

674
02:29:47,110 --> 02:29:59,370
I want that. Whatever it is. I don't think I can get there yet. That's six. Our gather somewhere

675
02:29:59,370 --> 02:30:17,559
in horned remains. Okay. How far away is that one? Like here, right? Like this thing here.

676
02:30:18,200 --> 02:30:26,010
Uh, this one. After break. Yeah. I gotta go pee. I'm going to go pee. I'm going to refill my drink

677
02:30:26,809 --> 02:30:32,200
and we will, I'll sit right here. We will be back and we will continue and we're going to fight

678
02:30:32,200 --> 02:35:58,979
whatever that thing is up there. I'll be right back. Hey, hey, are you lean? Um,

679
02:36:01,860 --> 02:36:08,090
maybe everywhere, but like the bottom of my stomach, it's kind of, I have like a big like

680
02:36:08,090 --> 02:36:14,309
stomach now. See, I think it just kind of happens after you turn like 35. I think it just does.

681
02:36:15,030 --> 02:36:39,690
I have like this, the dad's stomach. Okay. I am ready. Turn. Elden ring. Let's go. Oh,

682
02:36:41,059 --> 02:36:49,909
here's the question. Do I have enough? I probably do. All right. Here's what we're doing. Boom.

683
02:36:54,569 --> 02:37:22,170
That felt good. Boom. And boom. Anybody else's screen frozen? Shouldn't be. Now I only need

684
02:37:23,049 --> 02:37:33,459
a few more things. I think your stream crash. No, I'm look, I'm here. Where's the Burger King

685
02:37:33,459 --> 02:37:37,700
head from? Burger King head is from the academy. It's like, I don't know. I mean, I don't know if

686
02:37:37,700 --> 02:37:43,850
you find it here every time, but it was on like a crab or something. All right. How much is it to

687
02:37:43,850 --> 02:37:55,719
level up? I just gotta go kill one thing and I'm going to put it into, I'm going to put it into,

688
02:37:55,719 --> 02:38:00,180
I want to get to vigor to 20. I'm falling behind on health here. I need to, I need to start putting

689
02:38:00,180 --> 02:38:18,420
HP in. Let me just do that. Eight. That's it. Did you kill something? Just spawn those guys.

690
02:38:18,420 --> 02:38:36,540
They spawn everywhere when I don't want them. And now I don't know where they are. Backstab.

691
02:38:37,420 --> 02:38:55,190
I need, I was going to get to 14,000 or whatever. These potions are so bad. I need to find,

692
02:38:55,190 --> 02:38:58,790
I'm surprised I haven't found any more of those tiers. I only have a plus one flask.

693
02:38:59,670 --> 02:39:05,750
I need to drink two potions to heal bar, which is not, that's not good.

694
02:39:08,200 --> 02:39:16,170
I need to find more of those damn things. The island to the south.

695
02:39:16,809 --> 02:39:21,719
I might have to do that sooner rather than later because I'm going to fall behind hard here.

696
02:39:41,370 --> 02:39:48,729
I'm just, I just want to get souls quickly and I'm just, I'm counteracting the whole point here.

697
02:39:49,610 --> 02:40:02,379
There we go. Okay. Uh, one more should do it. In fact, I probably, I, these little like weird

698
02:40:02,379 --> 02:40:25,020
weasel things. I'm sorry. I'm, I can't do it. It looked at me. It looked at me. You've waited.

699
02:40:25,579 --> 02:40:38,920
I'm surprised at level three that doesn't down. Okay. That's enough.

700
02:40:39,799 --> 02:41:06,260
But I get into health and let's go to that, uh, weird animal statue. Let's move. This one's

701
02:41:06,260 --> 02:41:20,540
probably better classes. This, uh, I started with prisoner. She got down to say hello.

702
02:41:21,180 --> 02:41:36,600
Yeah, this is better. Rest of this one. Uh, I'm going to put on the boys

703
02:41:37,239 --> 02:41:47,850
as just to see how they are here. And I'm also going to probably put,

704
02:41:54,100 --> 02:41:59,700
yeah, I can't imagine that I'm going to be sitting there casting very many spells.

705
02:41:59,700 --> 02:42:15,750
So let's go. Here we go. All the beacons have been lit. Take a sip of my, uh,

706
02:42:16,549 --> 02:42:19,670
you can drink whatever you want. I got matcha tea here. Let me go and take a sip.

707
02:42:22,889 --> 02:42:28,920
Some good matcha. All right, here we go. Let's do it. I can be on the horse.

708
02:42:29,719 --> 02:42:48,979
Should I be on the horse? It's not, I can do it. I do hutch. Oh, I can touch it.

709
02:42:49,940 --> 02:43:02,409
Oh, I thought he was going to stand up. Okay. So we touched the remains and then

710
02:43:06,540 --> 02:43:27,420
inside of his dream or something. Ancestor spirit double jump one, two, and then land.

711
02:43:28,219 --> 02:43:52,229
It's a fire. No, it's okay. It's all right. So he goes down for a second.

712
02:43:53,030 --> 02:44:16,620
Oh, I just got horse kicked. Two, three, four. Oh shit. Great. That's two.

713
02:44:16,620 --> 02:44:40,229
Watch out. That's right on top of him. Two. No, that's just the head.

714
02:44:47,079 --> 02:45:41,129
Oh, this is so pretty. Okay. That's a, that goes three, right? Oh, didn't do three.

715
02:45:48,139 --> 02:46:21,049
No, I wonder if this is phase two. This feels very phase two. Stamina lying around. I like the way

716
02:46:21,049 --> 02:47:15,989
that looks, the lighting. That was really cool. Ancestral follower ashes. That wasn't too bad.

717
02:47:17,319 --> 02:47:25,430
That was, that was, that was like a relaxing fight. Ancestral follower ashes. Cool. And 10,000,

718
02:47:25,430 --> 02:47:37,500
12,000. Cool. Lost to Jerma. Yeah, that one was good. Is there anything else I can do here?

719
02:47:42,649 --> 02:47:45,129
That's, that's someone is sick too. Really?

720
02:47:47,379 --> 02:47:59,739
All right. Anything else here is that, but I don't want to miss anything. Will I miss something?

721
02:48:00,620 --> 02:48:05,340
Okay. So just save me like the 10 straight minutes it's going to take me to walk around

722
02:48:05,340 --> 02:48:10,709
in a circle. Do you guys even know? I don't think anyone would even know the area. Would

723
02:48:10,709 --> 02:48:19,129
anybody even know? That was really pretty. That was a nice like kind of change from the,

724
02:48:20,309 --> 02:48:25,110
like smash my controller into a hundred pieces. It was just like nice. It was just very enjoyable.

725
02:48:25,670 --> 02:48:47,930
Okay. Antlers too, like the magical dust. That was, I liked that one. Okay. So now what? I think I

726
02:48:47,930 --> 02:48:53,049
can, it was one area that I couldn't, it was at the gate, right? Over here. Let me try going up

727
02:48:53,049 --> 02:49:03,059
the gate. Should be going this way right here. And then through this way. Cause I can go over here.

728
02:49:08,100 --> 02:49:12,469
You do the teleports. Let me check this out. I'm just going to run. I'm going to run from here.

729
02:49:15,590 --> 02:49:18,950
Why was everybody telling me to look up here and look down and look up? Was it just bullshit?

730
02:49:19,670 --> 02:49:27,610
I was literally just here. Um, I got to level up again because I don't want to die.

731
02:49:28,329 --> 02:49:58,680
Nothing's so annoying. Bastard. Uh, what is it? 15, 16,000 to level up again.

732
02:49:59,479 --> 02:50:18,729
Spend those souls on gummy bears. All right. I want to go this way. It's definitely going

733
02:50:18,729 --> 02:50:24,950
to be another fire. I think I have to be up, right? Cause I'm all the way down.

734
02:50:26,870 --> 02:50:38,620
I gotta be way, I'm the wrong place. I gotta go over here. I gotta go back like that way. Back

735
02:50:38,620 --> 02:50:49,719
when I was on all those things. Go over to the right. Maybe I should just go back here

736
02:50:50,440 --> 02:50:58,629
and run from here through, through there. I need to get to this area. It just doesn't matter. Like

737
02:50:58,629 --> 02:51:12,579
right in the middle. Oh, you need a teleporter. You just, you can't just walk. Oh, I can't,

738
02:51:13,299 --> 02:51:22,329
I can't just get up there. Teleportable. Oh yeah. I just can't do it. All right. Well, I'll go,

739
02:51:22,329 --> 02:51:26,250
let's go to the teleporter. One of the teleporters that was here. It was one right here.

740
02:51:27,129 --> 02:51:32,760
The elevator. I don't want to use them right now. There are no, I only have a certain amount.

741
02:51:33,479 --> 02:51:43,879
I don't want to use them. Okay. Let's go on the teleporter. Where was it? It was like right here,

742
02:51:43,879 --> 02:51:54,899
right? What was it? It was like over here. It's edge. You really should restart the game.

743
02:51:58,969 --> 02:52:03,500
I wonder, you know, it's going to be really interesting eventually.

744
02:52:06,260 --> 02:52:19,659
What all the speed runners do. Imagine this game speed ran. How, where do you go? Really?

745
02:52:20,219 --> 02:52:41,030
This is where you took me. Is it just to go between those two? What's the point of that?

746
02:52:46,440 --> 02:52:58,010
There's no point in doing that. The speed run is a boss there. Okay. Let me check that out right

747
02:52:58,010 --> 02:53:02,899
there. And I get to that from here. And if not, then I'm just going to go back and we'll continue

748
02:53:02,899 --> 02:53:10,940
to trek through. Don't you just love, I've been playing for almost three hours and this whole

749
02:53:10,940 --> 02:53:20,040
three hours has been me stumbling upon a random ass place and fighting a boss that was at the end

750
02:53:20,040 --> 02:53:24,680
of it. And it was really fun and cool. And the area is crazy. I haven't done, this was just,

751
02:53:24,680 --> 02:53:28,040
oh, what's this gazebo? And then I walked in it and here we are three hours later.

752
02:53:28,920 --> 02:53:49,799
Oh yeah. That's remarkable. All right. Well, I can act, I can still explore up here and I get

753
02:53:49,799 --> 02:54:06,329
even further up. Is there a reason to go on that? Probably not. I love getting flasks,

754
02:54:06,329 --> 02:54:16,149
but I would really like a seed to make it so I don't have a plus one flask. All right. Hold on,

755
02:54:16,149 --> 02:54:29,530
settle down. Going this way. Hey, over here. You want a hint for that? Or do you want to find it

756
02:54:29,530 --> 02:54:34,090
on your own? Um, I would say if it begins to start to become like a real problem where I actually

757
02:54:34,090 --> 02:54:40,250
don't come across them at all over the next like couple hours, maybe because I cannot have one

758
02:54:40,250 --> 02:55:03,020
flask. That's going to be horrible. That's what I mean. Still haven't used any of those. I believe

759
02:55:03,020 --> 02:55:21,129
we have exhausted everything we can do in this area. For now. For now. How do I get out of here?

760
02:55:21,129 --> 02:55:39,430
Do the elevator? Don't leave. Don't leave. There's a third one. Find it. Um,

761
02:55:40,149 --> 02:55:49,299
can you note down the two teleporters? Yeah, I went in both of them. One of them, they just travel

762
02:55:49,299 --> 02:55:53,879
between each other. They just go one to the other. I'm probably going to delete that now in my notes.

763
02:55:54,600 --> 02:56:08,090
I'll come back. I've done what I've done, what I've been able to see that I can really do.

764
02:56:08,809 --> 02:56:13,100
The only exception is going back here and just taking one quick look around,

765
02:56:13,100 --> 02:56:38,600
like here. Oh, not here. The next one. This one here. Because there's back here.

766
02:56:40,629 --> 02:56:54,459
Wait, no. Where? No, that was correct. That was correct. Yeah, that was correct. Yeah, that was

767
02:56:54,459 --> 02:57:05,989
correct. This is going to kill me. So back here is this thing, right? This is the kind of in-between

768
02:57:06,069 --> 02:57:17,700
area where I came from. Can I go and check really quick? Because that's the elevator.

769
02:57:18,579 --> 02:57:34,309
Elevator there. What does your stream title mean? Um, I don't know. No, okay. I'll go back up.

770
02:57:36,149 --> 02:57:41,180
You get your item scaling. Like I have an A scaling with matcha powder. It's just like,

771
02:57:41,180 --> 02:57:44,459
it's doing so much for me and it's making my game. It's making me feel like so much better.

772
02:57:44,459 --> 02:57:54,489
I think my gameplay so much better. I'm going back down. Whatever. Just get off. Get off. Get

773
02:57:54,489 --> 02:58:02,260
off. I don't want to. Okay. I'm an idiot. Yeah, this just takes you back to where I was the first

774
02:58:02,260 --> 02:58:12,680
time. Yeah. Uh, I'm out. It was cool. I, if I need to come back, I will. So we're going to get out

775
02:58:12,680 --> 02:58:22,940
and I'm going to go back to where I was here because I don't want to, I wanted to go this way

776
02:58:23,739 --> 02:58:39,129
and that's when I got, this is that area there. Okay. I want to check what this is. Let's go here.

777
02:58:39,129 --> 02:58:46,010
End of the stream. What? The stream is not turning off for at least at the very least,

778
02:58:48,299 --> 02:59:04,760
like five or six hours. So you've got that wrong. Oh no, no, no, no, no. And I'm going to tell you,

779
02:59:04,760 --> 02:59:10,440
I am going to take a break somewhere later tonight. Like probably in like a few hours,

780
02:59:10,440 --> 02:59:14,760
a couple of hours, maybe I'm going to eat. Uh, so I'm going to eat something,

781
02:59:15,479 --> 02:59:28,360
wherever that is, figure that out. Maybe I eat. And after that, where am I going? This way.

782
02:59:29,659 --> 02:59:53,370
So I will be able to eat something. It won't be a 30 minute break. No, this way. That will give me

783
02:59:53,370 --> 02:59:58,170
the energy to be able to stream for like probably another few hours. So I'll be good to go. God

784
02:59:58,170 --> 03:00:11,379
dammit. I keep going on. Wait, there's one of those things. Uh, what? That's not that, that's

785
03:00:11,379 --> 03:00:16,219
literally like not that far. Why are you talking about? There was no far at all.

786
03:00:16,780 --> 03:00:34,940
I've survived other falls that were far more than that. I'm terrified to do that now. What? Um,

787
03:00:36,069 --> 03:00:45,780
I'm terrified to do this. That kills me. Look at how short that is. It's a bug. Uh, no, no,

788
03:00:45,780 --> 03:01:05,239
it's not. I'm sorry. I'm going down here. I'm terrified to do this. I swear to God, don't fall.

789
03:01:05,239 --> 03:01:15,770
Hold on. Wait, what if I pick up the souls? Oh, they're not. Okay. We're good. All right.

790
03:01:15,770 --> 03:01:23,000
How did I get over there last time? Like I'm just trying to go this way.

791
03:01:24,200 --> 03:01:40,809
You're going to cross the river. That just teleported you. Oh, that's okay. Right.

792
03:01:40,809 --> 03:02:02,340
Does this kill me? It does. I swear I jumped down here before. I swear to God. How did I get in

793
03:02:02,340 --> 03:02:07,059
there before? I was down there before. Remember? I was like, oh, if you're looking for that blood

794
03:02:07,059 --> 03:02:21,909
weapon, it's down here. Well, okay. We're going to find another way across the bridge. Jump later.

795
03:02:21,909 --> 03:02:43,079
I don't think the double jump stops fatal fall damage. Weird guy in a Burger King costume comes

796
03:02:43,079 --> 03:03:14,420
over and wrecks your campsite and kills you. I get his weapon. Hayden sell swords. Cool. What was

797
03:03:14,420 --> 03:03:35,850
that? Strength and dex or it's a great sword. That's pretty cool. What's that? What's the weapon

798
03:03:35,850 --> 03:04:01,219
art? Like a cool spin. Oh, very nice. Look at how powerful I am being back in Limgrave.

799
03:04:02,459 --> 03:04:15,639
You have nothing on me. Is that another armored car? Unless that's the armored car that came all

800
03:04:15,639 --> 03:04:28,100
the way down foot road. No, that's another armored car. Let's go waste the tree Sentinel. I beat

801
03:04:28,100 --> 03:04:37,989
him a long time ago. That was the first boss I killed. Did I already get this or is this another

802
03:04:37,989 --> 03:05:04,969
just armored car? Well, let's go. How do I get them to stop? Stop. Stop the vehicle. Stop the

803
03:05:04,969 --> 03:05:36,329
vehicle. Stop the vehicle. Oh, shit. Here they come. Great acts. Bye. Look at this. Oh my God.

804
03:05:36,329 --> 03:06:25,379
How many people? How about you? I'm so much stronger than them now. Shut up. You fucking idiot.

805
03:06:26,420 --> 03:07:19,370
What was that guy doing? I can't. Why can't I? I don't have any mana. All right. Cool. I got a great

806
03:07:19,370 --> 03:07:32,520
axe. I'm so powerful for this area now though. All right. I want to go right here because like,

807
03:07:32,520 --> 03:07:49,510
what is this? It's kind of cool. It's over here. Waypoint ruins. Remember there are two items.

808
03:07:50,069 --> 03:08:04,440
Left stick makes it so you dismount easier. I unbound my dismount because it's crouched

809
03:08:04,440 --> 03:08:10,729
too and then ruins my video game experience. All right. It's probably like a mini boss down here.

810
03:08:10,729 --> 03:08:32,219
Let's get it. Low stone. There's one in the front. There's an item in the front of the cart.

811
03:08:32,860 --> 03:09:31,879
You're not going to tell me twice. Thanks for making me come all the way back here.

812
03:09:33,659 --> 03:09:41,239
Nothing. Okay. I need a bonfire. I mean, I have enough to level up so I can be careful.

813
03:09:41,239 --> 03:10:11,049
People call me Jimmy. You guys are full of weird baits today. Okay. Jimmy. Okay. Up there.

814
03:10:14,500 --> 03:10:48,579
Fortnite. Fortnite. Jimmy. All right. I got a good view. Found it. Yeah, man. I got poisoned. I was

815
03:10:48,579 --> 03:10:56,500
just trying to pick up the items and leave. There's definitely a bonfire down here. That's

816
03:10:56,500 --> 03:11:06,979
just a boss. Shit. I need a bonfire over here somewhere. Oh, hi there, Jimmy. Oh, hey there,

817
03:11:06,979 --> 03:11:23,989
Jimmy. Oh, hey there. Oh, hey, Jimmy. There's got to be a teleporter here. Well, I'll just mark it.

818
03:11:25,350 --> 03:11:38,729
I'll level up anyways because I might die to boss. Oh, I'm turning around. There's going to be one

819
03:11:38,729 --> 03:11:46,629
right here somewhere down the road. Just wait. There has to be one sitting on the side like

820
03:11:46,629 --> 03:12:06,790
usually, right? Come on. I'm very far away from one. There's got to be one. Not like right here.

821
03:12:07,430 --> 03:12:18,250
There's a little lake right at the edge. Why am I dying? Because I am currently poisoned. It has

822
03:12:18,250 --> 03:12:32,170
to be. It's definitely not. It's just so far away. Can we get a look at me, please? Look at me.

823
03:12:33,209 --> 03:12:50,649
All right. I have 20, which is where I want it to be. Rebalanced. I do need more endurance and we

824
03:12:50,649 --> 03:12:57,420
need two more mind and I need to get to 20. 18 endurance, 20 mind, and then the rest is going

825
03:12:57,420 --> 03:13:07,879
into intelligence and dexterity for the rest of the game. I'll keep it at eight heals. That's fine.

826
03:13:08,760 --> 03:13:27,909
These sacred tears. Can I get 20 likes on this? 20 likes. I'm just smoking crack. Okay, back here.

827
03:13:27,909 --> 03:13:51,989
I'm going to go in those ruins and fight the boss. Ooh, pretty tree. Something definitely over here

828
03:13:51,989 --> 03:13:58,280
as well. Yeah, hold on. There's a lot of random shit. Look at all these ruins. Golden rune, golden

829
03:13:58,280 --> 03:14:26,700
rune. Try to get them all. Oh, very cool. Something going on up there. What's your deal? What's your

830
03:14:26,700 --> 03:14:44,059
deal? Wow. Look at that tower. All right, let's go down here and do whatever is happening in this

831
03:14:44,059 --> 03:15:12,219
area. Let's see what's in here. I'm her boss. Let's go. Mad pumpkin head. Oh man, I am,

832
03:15:13,340 --> 03:15:42,389
I am very leveled for you. Got a thousand souls. Holy shit. Imagine if I was like level two.

833
03:15:56,250 --> 03:16:10,010
Ah, you're going to sneak this back here, huh? Hello. Okay. Um, the new NPC. Oh my God, we've,

834
03:16:11,540 --> 03:16:23,930
my queen, I finally found you. How long has it been? Three, four, five years. My queen.

835
03:16:32,180 --> 03:16:41,190
Sorcerer. The burger queen.

836
03:16:50,360 --> 03:16:57,959
I was exiled from the academy of Rhea Lucaria as a reviled apostate witch. Witch. Do you still wish

837
03:16:57,959 --> 03:17:13,700
to learn from me? Witch. Well, piece of work. I could be a warlock. You are now my protege in

838
03:17:13,700 --> 03:17:21,879
glintstone sorcery, but I refuse to coddle or cast kind words. Never. Anticipate grievances,

839
03:17:22,520 --> 03:17:35,110
young apprentice. Did you see what level I am? A lot. Okay. Enhances left-hand shield damage

840
03:17:35,110 --> 03:17:45,459
negation. I already have this. Glintstone's stars. I have glintstone arc, glintstone barrage,

841
03:17:46,100 --> 03:17:57,000
or glintstone's armament. Okay. I want a compilation for the amount of times that I've gone

842
03:17:57,879 --> 03:18:03,879
like over here. Just like one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. I feel it's been

843
03:18:03,879 --> 03:18:09,500
like 30 times. Can I actually put this on my weapon? Because this is a huge fucking deal

844
03:18:09,500 --> 03:18:29,940
if I can. I think so. You are a tadpole when it comes to magic. Infantile. Legs to walk.

845
03:18:30,819 --> 03:18:39,219
So to become a sorcerer, first you must face your ignorance. Shall we start learning?

846
03:18:40,180 --> 03:19:05,639
Yes, we shall in just a minute. Kill her. Why would I kill her when she's the only person that has

847
03:19:07,000 --> 03:19:24,379
these moves? All right. The other one that I want. Crystal barrage or stars. Barrage sounds kind of

848
03:19:24,379 --> 03:19:35,860
cool. Fires a volley of glintstone and crystal shards. Charging increases potency. Or fires three

849
03:19:35,860 --> 03:19:40,100
magic shooting stars that pursue the target. The source can be cast while in motion and you can

850
03:19:40,100 --> 03:19:56,549
charge it. Didn't the turtle sell this? I think the turtle already sells this. I don't think the

851
03:19:56,549 --> 03:20:10,520
turtle has this one. He sold comets. Stars is garbage. I wonder how barrage, I wonder what that

852
03:20:10,520 --> 03:20:18,629
is. I'll try barrage. I already have the other ones besides the shield. Go play with our new toys.

853
03:20:19,270 --> 03:20:29,459
R1, R1, R1, R1. Goodbye. Thank you. That was cool. That was definitely worth stumbling upon.

854
03:20:30,180 --> 03:20:43,799
Red glintstone, please. Okay, so here is magic weapon. So I have glintstone pebble, swift

855
03:20:43,799 --> 03:20:57,940
glintstone shard, great glintstones shard, omit, which I can't use, barrage. All right, so I have

856
03:20:57,940 --> 03:21:09,020
to leave this area. Okay, cool. Stars is good. Sorcery in the other From Software games is kind

857
03:21:09,500 --> 03:21:19,479
of weird. It's a little it's a little odd. Some of the moves were just dog shit, just absolute

858
03:21:19,479 --> 03:21:22,280
dog shit. And they scaled terribly. And it was like, why are they even in the game?

859
03:21:23,510 --> 03:21:38,860
I don't know. I hope they actually are all these viable. Okay, that's kind of cool. Oh, my God,

860
03:21:38,860 --> 03:21:59,540
what the fuck? This guy's dead. Sucks. Let's keep going this way. That's my destination.

861
03:22:00,180 --> 03:22:08,790
But yeah, sorcery was always one of those weird things they put in all these games. Because

862
03:22:08,790 --> 03:22:13,430
there's this like one move that scales and it's just unbelievable and has the right cast time

863
03:22:13,430 --> 03:22:19,510
to be the best. But then they have like a dozen other of these like crystal barrage pebble stones

864
03:22:20,149 --> 03:22:27,620
that they just like suck and they're just useless. PvE. Right? Because a lot of sorcery

865
03:22:27,620 --> 03:22:48,020
is insane in PvP. Wrong way. Still alive. I'm going the wrong way. You're right.

866
03:22:55,559 --> 03:23:03,979
Oh, Hayden armor. But yeah, sorcery. Some of those things are cool in PvP. And that's what

867
03:23:03,979 --> 03:23:10,090
they're kind of maybe designed for. It does look like there's a lot more interesting spells.

868
03:23:10,809 --> 03:23:18,969
At least what it looks like. At least maybe initially, I could be wrong. So we got to go

869
03:23:19,610 --> 03:23:35,700
this way towards one. Hello. Oh, sapling sweet sapling of glorious gold. As your crystal teardrop

870
03:23:35,700 --> 03:23:47,219
ripened. You look like an NPC from the PS2 Sopranos game. The only reason why I'm

871
03:23:47,219 --> 03:23:52,600
addressing that comment is because I think I've seen that comment like 30 times in the last

872
03:23:52,600 --> 03:24:00,500
four straight days. I keep seeing that comment. What do you want me to say? You want to be like,

873
03:24:00,500 --> 03:24:14,600
yo, what the fuck did you say? Like, what do you want me to say? Maybe I'll run into something

874
03:24:14,600 --> 03:24:57,620
else here. Don't. The Elden Ring. Yeah, the Elden Ring. The Elden Lord. Lord. Oh, nice.

875
03:25:07,860 --> 03:25:14,040
I'm actually happy to find it. In the meantime, I'm going to do this.

876
03:25:16,659 --> 03:25:31,860
I'm running out of mana. Let's try this. This is Crystal Barrage. It's kind of annoying. Can't do

877
03:25:31,860 --> 03:25:49,299
it. Can't do it on this weapon. Oh, well. Do I have to be in combat? I don't think I do. I think

878
03:25:49,299 --> 03:25:58,120
this is already a magic weapon, so they won't let me do it. Yep. Nope. It's like, sorry. Ready?

879
03:25:58,120 --> 03:26:10,520
Let's see. Watch this. Sad. Sad. Because look at how it gets so blue and pretty. Sad. That's very

880
03:26:10,520 --> 03:26:27,940
sad. Very, very sad. So I gotta put the other stuff back on. Greatsword is- I'm gonna keep the

881
03:26:27,940 --> 03:26:33,219
Greatsword on it. It's been very useful. This has to come off in favor of Great Glenstone.

882
03:26:33,940 --> 03:26:42,700
Because I want to give that a try. I haven't really played with it. That's really sad.

883
03:26:42,700 --> 03:26:53,129
But this thing is really good. It's already infused. Wait, what? What happened to my- What

884
03:26:53,129 --> 03:27:07,979
happened to my clothes? What happened? Korean Knight is still good. Does the armor do anything

885
03:27:07,979 --> 03:27:23,879
for me? No. Aiden Armor is pretty good, too. Do any of these do anything for me? Probably not.

886
03:27:33,340 --> 03:27:39,620
Red Maiden gauntlets are better. They're a lot heavier, though. They're just better.

887
03:27:50,549 --> 03:27:56,969
Stupid horns off. I'm gonna have to wear this the whole game, I think.

888
03:28:03,260 --> 03:28:10,840
Yeah. I'm gonna have to try that new shard. Let's go. On the horse. Going to this place over here.

889
03:28:11,879 --> 03:28:22,010
Through the woods. Dude, look at the graphics on that rock. They were pretty good. All right,

890
03:28:22,010 --> 03:28:30,540
new area. All right, this is like a little bear. Not as scary as the other one, but what's this?

891
03:28:40,950 --> 03:28:51,610
You are quite susceptible. You're not as scary as your, uh, big brother. You're not as scary as

892
03:28:51,610 --> 03:29:27,129
Mama Bear. All right, there's a huge one. Ah, Crown Slam. This is so awesome because you could

893
03:29:27,129 --> 03:29:31,930
literally just come back here. You could just go this way instead of the way that I went

894
03:29:32,489 --> 03:29:38,950
when you play for the first time. The new character. It doesn't matter. That's awesome

895
03:29:38,950 --> 03:29:59,620
for colossal weapons. Yeah. Coming over there. Open for business. Ooh, he's open for business.

896
03:30:00,420 --> 03:30:17,819
Let's check out this. See how the glint's done. It's really slow, but if it hits,

897
03:30:19,110 --> 03:30:39,579
okay, it's not that big of a deal. That move is really not good at all, actually. It's not good

898
03:30:39,579 --> 03:30:50,260
at all. It's actually pretty bad. All right, what is that? Because I'm about to go explore it.

899
03:30:52,180 --> 03:30:58,180
Demi-humans wax Roth. Now their mother's been taken. Where are you, Lord Kenneth? The night

900
03:30:58,340 --> 03:31:20,100
deviled by blood. He's in there. Let's go pay him a visit. Bring the burger queen some squirrels

901
03:31:20,100 --> 03:31:32,069
to get the good stuff. I brought the scrolls to the turtle. Maybe that was a mistake. Yeah,

902
03:31:32,069 --> 03:31:44,040
this thing kind of sucks. Now the sword takes the arc, takes place with the arc. Um, hole is okay.

903
03:31:44,920 --> 03:32:04,600
Maybe just put starlight on just for fun. I mean, it's really pretty. I'll keep it. Whatever. I

904
03:32:04,600 --> 03:32:08,200
really only use these two anyways for now, so I'll keep them on. The swift, uh, glintstone is

905
03:32:08,200 --> 03:32:16,809
awesome because it just happens in one second. It's good at night too. It lights up the area.

906
03:32:16,809 --> 03:32:31,020
What about the new summon? Oh, that's true. Put it on after this. Yeah, this is crazy because this

907
03:32:31,020 --> 03:32:36,780
is definitely a lower, please tell me that's one of those tears. Oh, that's a golden seed.

908
03:32:38,059 --> 03:32:42,899
All right, let's go be high level Andy and just fucking wipe this whole place apart.

909
03:32:43,780 --> 03:33:06,139
Is he fighting? Why is he fighting them? Over level the Andy. Well, I'm, I mean, I'm coming

910
03:33:06,139 --> 03:33:11,860
here for a very specific purpose. I just wanted to see what was over here. I also really needed

911
03:33:11,860 --> 03:33:23,700
that. Hey, where's your leader? The only one that can give me a true challenge who runs this place

912
03:33:34,790 --> 03:34:03,989
or hate. I feel like this thing's going to get up blood road for night. So this is where you watch

913
03:34:03,989 --> 03:34:10,299
out for that explosion. That would actually kill me. All the things. Oh my God. Where was I?

914
03:34:10,940 --> 03:34:21,350
Just stop. Yeah. You could tell how overleveled I am. I'm just seeing if they have any items in

915
03:34:21,350 --> 03:34:27,829
this form. I'm just looking for like sacred tier shard things. I promise. I'm not like trying to

916
03:34:27,829 --> 03:34:46,440
be like an idiot and just be like, look at, I'm just going to do the easy stuff. See, I don't even

917
03:34:46,440 --> 03:35:10,950
care about that. You have to go to sacred places. Oh, this is a sacred place. You know, when swift

918
03:35:10,950 --> 03:35:15,430
glint stone shard is killing things in one hit that you're going to embarrass this guy in front

919
03:35:15,430 --> 03:35:58,200
of what? How many people here? 50,000 an asshole. That's actually not a joke. Imagine fighting this

920
03:35:58,200 --> 03:36:32,840
guy at like level three, bloody slash and Godric night gauntlets. I'm going to say glasses. You can

921
03:36:32,840 --> 03:36:42,729
probably get a sword. That sword is probably awesome. You see how cool that looks. Godric

922
03:36:42,729 --> 03:36:47,530
night's glasses and just wearing them and just have disappeared glasses on. That would be so

923
03:36:47,530 --> 03:37:01,719
funny. Oh my God. I LOLing so hard. There are two more Burger King masks. Maybe I'll find them

924
03:37:01,719 --> 03:37:09,690
eventually. I'm looking for a very, okay. So here we go. This is like the end of the little dungeon.

925
03:37:15,239 --> 03:37:20,620
Dectis medallion left. They're going to pull some resident evil shit here.

926
03:37:21,180 --> 03:37:35,610
Join medallions to operate grand lift of Dectis. The right half is said to reside in Fort Faroth

927
03:37:35,610 --> 03:37:56,889
in the dragon barrow far to the east. Like over here, dragon barrow far to the east is okay.

928
03:37:57,370 --> 03:38:52,139
Okay, looks good. But I'm actually kind of glad I got that. Cool. So now I wonder, is it time to

929
03:38:52,139 --> 03:38:58,709
start to progress through here? I mean, it's pointing me here, right? Like this is, I think

930
03:38:58,709 --> 03:39:04,809
I can handle this impassable gray bridge. It wants me to go this way or it wants me to go up here,

931
03:39:05,370 --> 03:39:21,780
like in this area. Or it wants me to go, is that dragon, you know what, let's go kill that dragon.

932
03:39:22,500 --> 03:39:38,520
Yeah, let's go get that motherfucker right now. You should break a Sega Dreamcast over your head.

933
03:39:38,520 --> 03:39:52,100
Okay, great idea. There's a ton of content in the academy that you missed. Yeah, I'm, but I mean,

934
03:39:52,819 --> 03:40:03,979
I'm just kind of browsing around. I got eight flasks. I have a lot, I have more health now

935
03:40:04,860 --> 03:40:12,440
and I'm going to put on the magic defense shit. I can have most of it on already. Magic defense.

936
03:40:13,659 --> 03:40:25,399
Carrying gloves, cloth trousers, weirdly enough. Okay, this has got good magic defense. All right,

937
03:40:25,399 --> 03:40:36,139
what about this thing? Magic brass shield, but I can't wear it this one here. Okay, I'm ready to

938
03:40:36,139 --> 03:40:50,809
fight the dragon marked at number one. Where'd you find the medallion? Please, I need it.

939
03:40:53,379 --> 03:40:59,780
That medallion, that east, that left part of the medallion is in Fort Haight, which is down here

940
03:40:59,780 --> 03:41:05,299
all the way on like this little tail end here. Actually, literally right next to,

941
03:41:06,579 --> 03:41:12,420
right, barely to the east of the lake, Fort Haight.

942
03:41:37,979 --> 03:41:56,260
Sorry, I didn't, I didn't do this. Game fucking A's me. All right, let's do it. It's time. I

943
03:41:56,260 --> 03:42:06,139
actually need to go upgrade this weapon too. I think I got a somber stone. Let's see. This is

944
03:42:06,139 --> 03:42:13,510
a fight of just patience and just attacking only when you need to. Hope I don't get one shot by

945
03:42:13,510 --> 03:42:17,430
something, but you know, I'm prepared. Got the boys if I need to call on them, which I don't

946
03:42:17,430 --> 03:42:30,200
think I will. Let's go get this guy. I can probably get a few hits on him while he's lying down,

947
03:42:30,200 --> 03:42:56,329
which is exactly what I'm going to try to do. I like just, I like missed like 40% of those hits.

948
03:42:57,129 --> 03:43:43,770
Don't land on me. Doing, it's three hits. One, two, three, and that's it. Getting close. One, two,

949
03:43:43,770 --> 03:44:20,899
one is fine. Hey, fuck out of the way. I just hit my head on the ceiling. Cookie bug ambush. Yeah,

950
03:44:20,899 --> 03:44:29,780
what was that? I don't know why my brain was just like, wait, that's an item bug, but it's not.

951
03:44:29,780 --> 03:44:37,819
Those guys just hang out there. It's probably a closer, uh, bonfire here somewhere too, right?

952
03:44:38,459 --> 03:44:47,690
I thought this was a 1440p gamer. I am. I just don't stream in 1440p. I stream in 864p.

953
03:44:48,489 --> 03:45:08,040
Not 1080. I'm not basking. All right. Well, that was dumb, but you know, we're going to go

954
03:45:08,040 --> 03:45:27,700
forward again. I can use my shield as a weapon. Okay. This time don't miss every single time.

955
03:45:27,700 --> 03:46:12,170
Just stand right next to his leg and do it. I didn't jump over. All right. We got to,

956
03:46:12,170 --> 03:46:17,799
I was gonna say, we got to get away with this gigantic stone slab that's in the fucking way.

957
03:46:17,799 --> 03:46:41,559
Hey, I got to just run away. Just after I aggro the guy, just run the fuck away.

958
03:46:41,559 --> 03:46:46,840
Just get them away from all the debris and fucking rocks formation. Shit. That's a scattered run.

959
03:46:47,639 --> 03:46:54,069
That's just bring them out. So we don't end up going like this.

960
03:47:02,680 --> 03:47:16,899
Find a closer bonfire. Actually, that's not a bad idea. He's really strong against magic. Yeah.

961
03:47:16,899 --> 03:47:26,569
He's an anti me. What the I should be killing him so much more swiftly. Okay. I'm not, let me

962
03:47:26,569 --> 03:47:30,409
just see what, is there a little fire over here or something? Let's not go for him yet.

963
03:47:33,340 --> 03:48:11,190
There's maybe there is like a fire. What's this? I'm going in here. What's this? Academy crystal

964
03:48:11,190 --> 03:48:23,049
cave. Academy crystal cave is what it just said. And look at how much closer this is.

965
03:48:24,090 --> 03:48:55,260
Okay. Summoning stone thing. I'm glad I have the starlight. It seems to be pretty helpful here.

966
03:49:01,850 --> 03:49:07,000
Abe Moss, crystal cave moss. Oh, I don't like that. Give it back.

967
03:49:21,129 --> 03:49:25,850
What the fuck? Why? How? I'm not sneaky. I'm a gigantic beacon of light.

968
03:49:26,819 --> 03:49:37,719
There's so many people here. I'm a blip on their mini map right now. This is, oh God. Okay.

969
03:49:46,840 --> 03:49:48,600
Shit. They all aggroed. Nope. Not all of them.

970
03:50:20,500 --> 03:50:27,590
I look like one of you, but I'm not in the darkness. We all look alike. Don't we with our

971
03:50:27,590 --> 03:50:44,840
masks? They couldn't tell the difference. The imposter. Okay. So there's something over here.

972
03:50:44,840 --> 03:51:11,989
Look who glint's done. What else we got? There's definitely more. Very interested in what's at the

973
03:51:11,989 --> 03:51:41,879
end of this thesis. That doesn't have to be in the head. Fireflies. Dude, I came in here with the

974
03:51:41,879 --> 03:51:48,600
required item. Imagine coming down here without sorcery and without starlight. That'd be a living

975
03:51:48,600 --> 03:52:11,159
hell. You just get a lantern or a torch. Don't diminish my cool character. That replaces one

976
03:52:11,159 --> 03:52:38,379
of them, right? Okay. So that's that. There's that way. Can I do anything up here? Oh, skeletons.

977
03:52:47,940 --> 03:53:20,600
Game is really, really loading something heavily. So I want to do a magician fight. That's fine.

978
03:53:22,600 --> 03:53:38,180
Oh, maybe I'll get that one. I might get that move. Double motherfuckers. I'm out of here.

979
03:53:38,180 --> 03:54:34,709
What did you bring the manna? Oh my God. He's got a magic hammer. Oh, please give me the magic

980
03:54:34,709 --> 03:54:45,500
hammer. He's got this huge hammer. That's so cool. All right. Let's check and see what he was

981
03:54:45,500 --> 03:55:04,739
guarding. There's a boss in there too. Oh man. It's gonna be rough. Excuse me. Where are you?

982
03:55:13,780 --> 03:55:48,360
Pre-fire me. There's two chests here. Boost crystal sorcery, which I don't like. Is the sword

983
03:55:48,360 --> 03:56:06,299
technically crystal? I think the sword is a crystal sorcery. Or is it glintstone? 48 intelligence to

984
03:56:06,299 --> 03:56:17,540
put it on. I only have glintstones right now. Crystal ballot barrage. But the great sword thing

985
03:56:17,540 --> 03:56:24,149
that I swing. Eat cereal or soup tonight? I'll probably tell you soup because soup sounds a

986
03:56:24,149 --> 03:56:30,629
little more like healthy and like more nutrient based than like Captain Crunch. So I would say

987
03:56:30,629 --> 03:56:47,110
that you probably have soup tonight. Okay, there's enough chests in here too. And a runic. Well,

988
03:56:49,129 --> 03:56:52,409
unless there's a bonfire here, I'm gonna have to just go in here and see if I can do it.

989
03:56:53,209 --> 03:57:07,500
This is about 5,000 souls though. Maybe I should just run through it. What do you think? Buy to

990
03:57:07,500 --> 03:57:18,819
5,000 souls. Yeah. No, it's not worth it. Unless do I have? Hmm. I don't know. Only 5k. I can always

991
03:57:18,819 --> 03:57:26,360
go get it again. All right, let's go. I'm gonna go for it. 5k is not that much right now. It's two

992
03:57:26,360 --> 03:57:40,329
people. Oh, it's these two. I remember these guys. 13 fucking damage. That's it. Oh, I'm doing this

993
03:57:40,329 --> 03:58:07,979
wrong. I need to hit them with something else. I wonder how I'm supposed to hurt them. Oh my god,

994
03:58:07,979 --> 03:58:30,040
this guy's so annoying. Fucking R1 spamming piece of shit. Do I like end up breaking their crystals

995
03:58:31,159 --> 03:58:38,459
stuff? I don't know what the fuck he's doing. Oh my god, his fucking friend is so annoying.

996
03:58:41,899 --> 03:58:45,500
No, this is wrong, dude. I gotta like, I gotta attack him with something else.

997
03:58:46,379 --> 03:58:54,790
I would call the boys and I don't, I can't. Do I have any? What else can I hit them with?

998
03:58:54,790 --> 03:59:01,670
They made it a crystals. Maybe I should use like fire or something. Yeah, I remember these guys.

999
03:59:02,309 --> 03:59:22,920
All right, we're gonna break. I got it. I got it. We're gonna get those souls back. I think you just

1000
03:59:22,920 --> 03:59:29,260
have to, you probably have to hit them enough times to shatter them, right? That makes sense.

1001
03:59:29,260 --> 03:59:38,469
Oh man, this is far. Okay. Well, just gonna run. I got the boys on standby. Fucking idiot.

1002
03:59:46,709 --> 04:00:03,940
Strike damage. I have slash pierce, standard pierce, pierce, pierce slash strike. I mean,

1003
04:00:03,940 --> 04:00:09,620
the flail is a piece of crap, but it's strike. Maybe that'll break it. I mean, this thing sucks,

1004
04:00:09,620 --> 04:00:14,819
but whatever. I'm not looking to do anything fancy. Will this, will like a, will it break

1005
04:00:14,819 --> 04:00:22,420
their armor? Maybe it will. I'll try it. I don't think I have a blunt weapon that, um,

1006
04:00:23,219 --> 04:00:36,170
I don't have a blunt weapon. I got rid of all of them. I have a strategy. Strategy is just kite

1007
04:00:36,170 --> 04:00:49,159
the guy, the guy that's like, just R1 spamming and file. I don't know what the fuck I am right

1008
04:00:49,159 --> 04:00:54,729
now. So we're going to have to figure that out real quick. Okay. So let's go this way.

1009
04:00:58,260 --> 04:01:33,620
Is that big guy? This huge guy's here. Run around. All right, let's go boys. All right.

1010
04:01:33,940 --> 04:01:43,879
Drag him across the whole thing because he's really slow. Okay. Now I'm stuck on a fucking

1011
04:01:43,879 --> 04:02:26,250
rock. I was stuck in the rock. There we go. All right. Let's job boys. They're dead. Same

1012
04:02:26,250 --> 04:02:31,370
strategy. Pull them all the way back. Oh, what? What's that? Oh, I think I can't even get rid of

1013
04:02:31,370 --> 04:02:54,170
it. Come on, hurry up. I might, I'm just kill this guy first. Just line aside him by the,

1014
04:02:54,170 --> 04:03:29,420
with a statue. I'm trying to time to dodge on you. Oh my goodness gracious. Get him please.

1015
04:03:29,420 --> 04:04:16,299
R1. You fucking annoying little shit. Get down. Oh my God. All right. It's going to work. It's

1016
04:04:16,299 --> 04:04:35,850
going to work. Oh, this run back is such a pain in the absolute fucking Dick. I swear to God.

1017
04:04:40,819 --> 04:04:46,760
That strategy worked. I have to just get in there and just wail and chant the flail.

1018
04:04:46,760 --> 04:04:55,700
Does it work on weapons like this? I thought it only worked on like

1019
04:04:56,260 --> 04:05:18,180
swords. Does it, it actually works on flail? Okay. All right. Let's sit on. Oh, where is it?

1020
04:05:23,209 --> 04:05:38,020
Someone's an ancestral follower. I can't summon Oleg. Do I have enough to summon him? How much

1021
04:05:38,020 --> 04:05:51,270
FP do I have? Okay. Yeah. Let's try this guy. All right. Let's do it. I didn't even want to press

1022
04:05:51,270 --> 04:06:04,280
that button twice. I just like, there's just so many buttons. Get up. He hates the boys.

1023
04:06:04,920 --> 04:06:17,750
You can try parrying too. That guy is really predictable. I'm always afraid to parry boss

1024
04:06:17,750 --> 04:06:21,219
because I feel like half the time it just doesn't do anything. But those aren't,

1025
04:06:21,219 --> 04:06:27,000
those are not even bosses. It's just like those crystal people that were outside.

1026
04:06:32,620 --> 04:06:37,989
Like I went the wrong fucking way, but it doesn't like, like running through the shit sucks.

1027
04:06:38,069 --> 04:07:01,719
Asshole. 5k gone, but it'll fucking just really matter. It's to the right, not to the left. How's

1028
04:07:01,719 --> 04:07:29,209
the pain? Uh, well the game is annoying sometimes, right? That's just the way it is. Okay.

1029
04:07:30,649 --> 04:07:39,909
The help of the game didn't hang for three seconds when I turned the fucking corner.

1030
04:07:44,139 --> 04:08:07,370
I don't have enough man to summon my friend. It's a wash. What the fuck is that move? I can't

1031
04:08:07,370 --> 04:08:16,629
parry with the shield. Oh, it's cause I, the weapon art with the flail. Okay. So I can't do

1032
04:08:16,629 --> 04:08:21,420
both because otherwise I can't summon the guy. I was trying to parry, but I have,

1033
04:08:21,420 --> 04:08:41,899
I have the magic defense shield on. Okay. So I can't do both. I have to, unless I want to

1034
04:08:41,899 --> 04:08:56,620
bring mana potions, which I'll bring one mana potion. I want to try to parry this guy. Okay.

1035
04:08:56,620 --> 04:09:16,500
So let's go for this fucking horse shit. The red shirts fueling his anger. This run back is awful

1036
04:09:16,500 --> 04:09:22,340
though, because all it takes is just one little, like dinky little bullet to hit you in the back.

1037
04:09:23,059 --> 04:09:32,020
And that's it. And you're going to just say exactly what I'm saying. I'm just saying,

1038
04:09:38,569 --> 04:09:43,930
motherfuckers. Hold on a second. The game has to like load the shaders for 15 straight seconds.

1039
04:09:43,930 --> 04:10:18,500
Okay. Now we can play. Let's go. Oh, he's got a bow. He's just one damage. What? He sucks.

1040
04:10:19,059 --> 04:10:30,149
He did one damage. Oh my God. Why did you tell me to bring this guy? Why did you tell me to bring

1041
04:10:30,149 --> 04:10:58,260
him? One damage. All right. It's time to parry this fuck face. You can't parry. You can, you can,

1042
04:10:58,260 --> 04:11:02,899
you can, you can, you can, you can, you can, you can, you can. Okay. Just keep doing that.

1043
04:11:02,899 --> 04:11:17,100
Keep doing it. We're good. We're good. Not good. Fucking piece of shit with your spam.

1044
04:11:28,440 --> 04:11:30,840
Needs to be leveled up for something, man, because that's bad.

1045
04:11:42,229 --> 04:11:50,250
No, you are not hitting me with all of those. What the fuck? I just want to grab these guys by

1046
04:11:50,250 --> 04:11:56,520
their fucking heads. It's like three stooges. I just shatter both their brains and their heads.

1047
04:11:57,079 --> 04:12:01,100
Like, why can't I just grab them by their heads and just three stooges crush their heads?

1048
04:12:02,700 --> 04:12:11,079
Oh shit, Atriarch, what's up? Welcome, raiders. Currently dealing with a, dealing with a little

1049
04:12:11,079 --> 04:12:17,989
bit of a problem here. Thanks for the raid, Atriarch. I've got these two crystal idiots

1050
04:12:17,989 --> 04:12:22,709
down here and I'm having some trouble. Chat told me to summon this guy with the horns.

1051
04:12:22,709 --> 04:12:27,590
The guy did literally one damage. I wish I was making that up. I summoned him, took a whole

1052
04:12:27,590 --> 04:12:34,709
mana bar. He did one damage, one damage point. And then they ate him alive. So we're going to change

1053
04:12:34,709 --> 04:12:40,629
it up. We're going to go back to the boys. No, we're not. I'll tell you what we're doing.

1054
04:12:41,350 --> 04:12:53,639
Bringing in the dogs. The dogs are vicious. Go. I saw you've been playing it too and hopefully

1055
04:12:53,639 --> 04:12:59,739
you're doing okay. You caught me right in the middle of a, I'm a little upset. Try to calm down.

1056
04:13:00,379 --> 04:13:03,739
I'm going to try to get this to work. So let's, let's go ahead and get started.

1057
04:13:03,739 --> 04:13:14,120
Okay. Everything's fine. I have to level these people up. Like I can't just have them at level

1058
04:13:14,120 --> 04:13:18,440
one. Although, uh, all right, I'm going to get it this time because I'm going to just,

1059
04:13:19,079 --> 04:13:33,670
here we go. Everything is not cool. Everything is going to be just fine. I promise.

1060
04:14:02,969 --> 04:14:13,139
Everything's going to be just fine. And I can tell you right now,

1061
04:14:14,409 --> 04:14:55,430
there's no reason everybody's freaked out. You, no, you hesitated. Can't bring it back out.

1062
04:15:02,950 --> 04:15:05,989
Why is he doing a different move? You've been doing the same move the whole time.

1063
04:15:06,950 --> 04:15:22,440
He decides to change instead of going, he goes like, what was this new move set? Try guard

1064
04:15:22,440 --> 04:15:28,420
parrying? No, guard parry is not going to be a good idea. Cause guard parry, the caster guy

1065
04:15:29,219 --> 04:15:34,420
throws his fucking goddamn fruity pebbles at me from across the room. And I'm vulnerable.

1066
04:15:34,420 --> 04:15:47,270
If I do a guard parry, I have to go. Okay. I'm going to kill these guys. These guys are

1067
04:15:47,270 --> 04:15:57,450
not even that big of a deal. They're really not. It's going to come down to parry. Get them run.

1068
04:15:59,319 --> 04:16:09,239
Run, parry, get them, run, airy, run, get them. And don't get hit by like the 30 people in here

1069
04:16:09,239 --> 04:16:15,479
that cast the same fucking spell at you like that. He's still shooting it. He's shooting it at me.

1070
04:16:15,479 --> 04:16:18,760
He's still shooting it. I don't know which, which direction he's shooting it, but he's doing it.

1071
04:16:19,639 --> 04:16:26,809
It's going to have to be, it's going to have to be, I got to bring the boys out either that,

1072
04:16:26,809 --> 04:16:29,930
or we're going to try the other. Cause the boys are just annoying. They just get all over the place.

1073
04:16:31,159 --> 04:16:39,059
I'm going to upgrade the boys. The boys are annoying, right? They're annoying.

1074
04:16:41,690 --> 04:16:43,610
They just walk around and bump into walls and shit.

1075
04:16:44,409 --> 04:17:28,389
Aurene, get it off before this idiot does anything. You fuck. All right. Get away, get away,

1076
04:17:28,389 --> 04:17:30,389
get away, get away, get away, get away, get away, get away. Wait till he does the

1077
04:17:36,780 --> 04:18:07,370
line of sight with the statues. That's the plan right now. Check this out. Strategy. Excuse me.

1078
04:18:08,010 --> 04:19:15,159
I tried to lock on, but I couldn't. It's broken. Okay. All right. Just have to run. Fuck that rock.

1079
04:19:35,690 --> 04:20:16,020
Wow. Jeez. Ow, ow, ow. Slow down. Don't let him do anything else. Oh yeah.

1080
04:20:21,879 --> 04:20:33,559
Crystal release. Nice. I'm telling you the strategy, the strategy was you got a line of sight

1081
04:20:33,559 --> 04:20:40,780
with the first guy. I lost 5,000 souls and I'm not happy about it. I'm very upset about it.

1082
04:20:46,069 --> 04:20:59,239
What is this? Oh, nice. Holy shit. I was on camera. You got to see what it looked like.

1083
04:20:59,799 --> 04:21:18,040
That's just... Where does this go? Crystal release.

1084
04:21:18,840 --> 04:21:23,079
Where it's a massive crystal then shadows it to scour a wide area with a violent rain.

1085
04:21:23,719 --> 04:21:29,239
So is that the thing where it was just around me? Just... I want to try it.

1086
04:21:34,870 --> 04:21:56,389
Uh, it's an exit dungeon, but hold on. Where does this go? Shinema shield.

1087
04:21:59,139 --> 04:22:11,159
That's actually pretty funny. That was a good call though to take that off.

1088
04:22:11,719 --> 04:22:41,049
Academy of... Wait, what? What the fuck? I'm back at the academy. Hold the lever.

1089
04:22:41,690 --> 04:22:52,489
This is a different area of the academy. Uh, I can't. Soggy or crunchy cereal, bro? Please.

1090
04:22:52,489 --> 04:22:57,459
Why would you ever eat cereal, soggy? You guys are eating cereal wrong by the way. Let me tell

1091
04:22:57,459 --> 04:23:07,399
you how to fix it. So you only eat, only eat for a little bit of cereal in and a little bit of milk.

1092
04:23:08,120 --> 04:23:13,239
You eat that first. Don't like dump, people dump like three or four cups of fucking cereal,

1093
04:23:13,239 --> 04:23:19,559
just mass cereal in their bowl. And then they just, you just dump milk in there and then it

1094
04:23:19,559 --> 04:23:24,760
becomes a mess. Sometimes you don't even eat all of it. You do like half a cup of cereal and then

1095
04:23:24,760 --> 04:23:29,239
like a little bit, like a quarter cup of milk, half a cup of milk. Eat that. It's going to be

1096
04:23:29,239 --> 04:23:33,479
crunchy and perfect. Then just do a little bit more. Pour a little bit more in the bowl,

1097
04:23:33,479 --> 04:23:35,639
a little bit more milk. I don't know how people keep getting this wrong.

1098
04:23:36,520 --> 04:23:57,770
What is, this is just like a secret chest. Terra Magicus. Terra Magicus. Raises the magic

1099
04:23:57,770 --> 04:24:12,180
strength of those within the sigil. What? I don't get it. This is just like a buff. Okay,

1100
04:24:12,180 --> 04:24:16,340
this is a glintstone. Draws an academy sigil upon the ground, raising the magic strength of those

1101
04:24:16,340 --> 04:24:25,319
within it. So I put a sigil on the ground and then I can just bam. It's an, it's a buff. Okay,

1102
04:24:25,319 --> 04:24:38,469
that's pretty cool. Hell yeah. Nice. Nice. All right. Awesome. You yell a little less. Uh,

1103
04:24:38,469 --> 04:24:55,020
I don't think that's going to happen. I'm sorry, man. Talk to the sorcerer about the gate key with

1104
04:24:55,020 --> 04:25:01,290
the new opening. Uh, I do have to go talk to that guy, but I can't give it to him. Maybe he'll tell

1105
04:25:01,290 --> 04:25:14,809
me where another one is. Fast travel from here. Uh, yeah. Let, let me go talk to him. So he says,

1106
04:25:15,530 --> 04:25:25,030
this, this is right. Yeah, it's right here. Where is it? Yeah. Church, the church of

1107
04:25:25,190 --> 04:25:45,750
fear. It's right there. All right. Oh, all right. These are great runs. I gotta go. I don't,

1108
04:25:45,750 --> 04:25:55,450
I don't, I don't, I don't know what those are. Is this the right place? No, it's this church,

1109
04:25:55,450 --> 04:26:19,430
right? You got them from the boss. Yeah, that's right. Are you going to start vaping? Uh, I,

1110
04:26:19,430 --> 04:26:30,920
I'm not going to start vaping. I'm the person up on the second. I can't give it to him. What if I,

1111
04:26:30,920 --> 04:26:37,700
am I going to screw everything up here if I give this to him? He said I can't give it to anybody.

1112
04:26:44,090 --> 04:26:47,989
I don't know what happens if I do it. I'm kind of scared.

1113
04:26:49,590 --> 04:26:54,309
So you found yourself a blintstone key, but I certainly can't take it from you.

1114
04:26:54,309 --> 04:26:58,469
That key belongs to you. By rights, you should use it for yourself. It's true.

1115
04:26:59,350 --> 04:27:03,989
I wish to return to my place of study, but that's no excuse to impose upon others.

1116
04:27:05,590 --> 04:27:11,829
Is this why Bluntstones always finish last? Okay. So where's another one? Head to the academy of

1117
04:27:11,829 --> 04:27:15,430
real. Carry on with your journey. Don't bother holding yourself up for my sake.

1118
04:27:15,430 --> 04:27:22,500
Dude, is there another one in the, in the second? There's a second key in the academy.

1119
04:27:23,459 --> 04:27:45,979
I just go get it. Academy grand library and Academy gate. I mean, there's, I don't know

1120
04:27:45,979 --> 04:28:00,090
where to start. Would it be somewhere in here? Eight parlors, schoolhouse. It looks like the

1121
04:28:00,090 --> 04:28:04,329
only place I really haven't been is here. So I'm going to go to like the church and go backwards

1122
04:28:04,969 --> 04:28:21,540
this way. I was going to put a marker here and just whatever. Uh, why do you hate crack?

1123
04:28:21,780 --> 04:28:31,879
People keep saying you need to use your great runs. I have to go to the place where I can use

1124
04:28:31,879 --> 04:28:40,809
them. It's like the tower, right? There's a tower that I haven't gone to yet. That I don't know.

1125
04:28:40,809 --> 04:28:49,930
Like, is it over here? I take it to a tower. I'm imagining this is the tower. If I were to take a

1126
04:28:49,930 --> 04:29:02,489
guess, I will go do that afterwards. All right. So now the play is to try to go this way. I think

1127
04:29:02,809 --> 04:29:12,340
I think, see if I can, can I get in there from here? I don't know if I can get over here from

1128
04:29:12,340 --> 04:29:36,600
there. Hmm. There's another section in this academy. Maybe from here. Okay. Let's try this.

1129
04:29:38,569 --> 04:29:44,709
I head over here. This is where those, um, water wheel is.

1130
04:29:47,879 --> 04:29:54,579
Which I need to be this way. So it looks like there's a path here somewhere. Hold on.

1131
04:29:54,579 --> 04:30:04,469
Out this again. No, I'm not doing the water wheel. I got to find a way over this way.

1132
04:30:05,030 --> 04:30:20,139
I'm here. I'm just going to run. It's like, I've already done this like five times.

1133
04:30:31,180 --> 04:30:38,219
I know. I'll clear this because this pot, the big pots there is this area. This is where I fought

1134
04:30:38,219 --> 04:30:48,739
the boss. Is there another way to keep going from the boss's chamber? But I didn't see.

1135
04:30:49,459 --> 04:31:05,350
If there was that way. Remember, what if you were like my dentist? Okay. So I remember this.

1136
04:31:06,149 --> 04:31:38,200
Was there another way to go that way? Spam age isn't fun. Maybe annoying. Yeah. Okay. Wait,

1137
04:31:38,200 --> 04:31:40,969
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,

1138
04:31:40,969 --> 04:31:51,260
over there. Like that way. I've been there. I don't think I've been there yet.

1139
04:31:51,819 --> 04:32:14,920
All right. You've kind of making this a real pain in the ass for me right now.

1140
04:32:14,920 --> 04:32:35,299
Can't just cheese you. Oh my God. Fuck all of you. Okay. Oh, that's right. That's right. That's

1141
04:32:35,299 --> 04:32:38,180
right. That's right. That's right. I didn't go. I remember I looked over here and I was like,

1142
04:32:38,180 --> 04:32:45,750
oh yeah, yeah, I didn't do it. Okay. Here we go. That's right. I did look over here and I said,

1143
04:32:45,750 --> 04:32:52,659
well, maybe later. The thing with from software games is maybe later means never again. I will

1144
04:32:52,659 --> 04:33:09,939
never look at this part of the game ever again. So you're right. Let's go. Ouch. Oh, it's him.

1145
04:33:10,580 --> 04:33:28,549
I got bad sorceries on for this. It's going to go weapons. We're just going to go with the two

1146
04:33:28,549 --> 04:33:46,869
handed. All right. That's that way. Cool. The POG, the POG champ, IRL pony ride stream waiting room.

1147
04:33:54,299 --> 04:33:57,740
It would be the most, that would be one of the most boring streams you probably would ever see

1148
04:33:57,740 --> 04:34:09,349
here. Just riding a pony. I imagine with a GoPro here, just looking down, just never so often just

1149
04:34:09,349 --> 04:34:44,500
hear like, then like the big horse sneezes, like somebody under that and check. Oh, they're

1150
04:34:44,500 --> 04:34:56,310
acts. Yeah, I see. Okay. Good try. Good try. I can't really cast any spells. So we're going

1151
04:34:56,310 --> 04:35:12,009
to have to do this. I didn't think you were going to attack. Nice try. Pull them each.

1152
04:35:15,540 --> 04:35:26,819
What the fuck is that move? I want it. Oh shit. This is bad. That's not what I wanted to have

1153
04:35:26,819 --> 04:36:02,840
happen at all. It's coming. Damn it. And cage. Oh, everything is fine. I went, I just got so slumped

1154
04:36:02,840 --> 04:36:33,849
down. I was like, this sucks. We're good though. And yeah, progress. Let's go. I wonder if I ring

1155
04:36:33,849 --> 04:36:46,169
that bell. All these rooftops. It might be another boss up here too. That'd be cool. Meteor bolt.

1156
04:36:47,610 --> 04:37:07,060
Oh, cool. That's cool. That's cool. What is that? Cool. It's like we're jumping. Are you mocking

1157
04:37:07,060 --> 04:37:31,939
yourself? Um, I don't know. I hope this doesn't hurt. Right to my marker. Perfect. Exactly where

1158
04:37:31,939 --> 04:38:18,310
I wanted to go. There's no way I make that jump. It's being thorough. I could go here. That guy is

1159
04:38:18,310 --> 04:38:22,490
scary looking. I wish I had a sorcerer to kill him with, but I don't. And he's gonna, Oh God,

1160
04:38:22,490 --> 04:38:29,000
this is bad. All right. Oh, it's just an archer. All right. Nevermind.

1161
04:38:32,729 --> 04:38:40,970
That over there. Um, I'm gonna get that. I'm gonna have to go all the way back around and back up,

1162
04:38:40,970 --> 04:38:51,029
but that's an item that I want. Imbued sword key. That's different. What is an imbued sword key?

1163
04:38:51,590 --> 04:39:15,529
I'll check it. What the fuck? Oh shit. Uh, there's a lot of places I can go. I

1164
04:39:16,490 --> 04:39:25,590
I'm gonna go back over here. Did you take a break? Uh, yeah, I did already. I'm gonna take a food

1165
04:39:25,590 --> 04:39:36,009
break here. Maybe later. You check around every single building because they put stuff everywhere.

1166
04:39:37,750 --> 04:39:44,119
You never know when you're going to find a something that you, uh, need. All right. Do I

1167
04:39:44,119 --> 04:40:07,819
go down the ladder or do I just jump over the rooftops? I'm marking it. Oh fuck. I wonder if

1168
04:40:07,819 --> 04:40:45,139
there's another boss. That bait was so annoying and I'm in trouble now. I can go down here,

1169
04:40:45,939 --> 04:40:54,020
which leads to, I've already been here, but have I been? No, I don't know. Have I been at that level

1170
04:40:54,020 --> 04:40:59,939
of the roof? I'm not going to go down yet because there's an area to go this way too.

1171
04:41:01,689 --> 04:41:17,819
What the fuck was that? I have no health. This is bad. Oh, I remember looking up here,

1172
04:41:19,299 --> 04:41:45,270
seeing that. Is that a lie? It might be. That was such an ugly face. I hate that one.

1173
04:41:45,990 --> 04:42:02,310
That was like, I, I did not like that one. I got a key after all that. I still kind of want to.

1174
04:42:03,029 --> 04:42:14,459
There's the main is the, where was it? Where was it? Where was it? I keep forgetting here.

1175
04:42:14,459 --> 04:42:18,729
Where's the court? How was the courtroom? Cause I want to go back up there.

1176
04:42:19,209 --> 04:42:27,159
It's a classroom and you run through and then the courtroom courthouse is like here,

1177
04:42:27,959 --> 04:42:49,860
courtyard. Hey, I've been up here. I haven't even been up here.

1178
04:42:54,139 --> 04:43:02,099
Luzuli glint stone sword. That's different. Oh shit. I gotta be careful. Get the item.

1179
04:43:03,299 --> 04:43:32,759
Shattering crystal. Yeah. Right. What was the last one? One, two, three, four.

1180
04:43:41,349 --> 04:43:53,340
I kicked the ladder down. Oh my goodness gracious. You gotta be fucking kidding me.

1181
04:43:53,340 --> 04:43:55,020
Hell yeah. This is definitely leads to something.

1182
04:44:01,000 --> 04:44:22,700
Fuck. And that's how unfair was that? He can't, I, he wasn't, we won't back up.

1183
04:44:23,419 --> 04:44:29,619
I try to hit him, a bump into him, slash him and he just, what? All right. Where is the,

1184
04:44:29,619 --> 04:44:37,240
where the fuck is that? I just knocked a ladder down. Where's that ladder? I don't,

1185
04:44:37,240 --> 04:44:47,939
I don't know where I am. The room where you just came from, but where first grace.

1186
04:44:51,220 --> 04:45:01,130
Uh, where was that? This one here, bait parlor.

1187
04:45:03,290 --> 04:45:21,319
I'll get your spells. Oh, you're right. Okay. Let me change my spells. That cannot stay on.

1188
04:45:21,319 --> 04:45:25,319
I'm going to go back to swift glint stone. We're going to change this to,

1189
04:45:27,540 --> 04:45:35,020
and that need more intelligence. Let's do the, the pole pole is pretty good.

1190
04:45:38,150 --> 04:45:44,700
All right. So I can see where I died on the map. Oh fuck. That's in the church.

1191
04:45:45,959 --> 04:46:39,669
I died like over here. You please read. I'm your biological son. I just found your channel.

1192
04:46:40,389 --> 04:46:53,529
That'd be, that'd be weird. I don't think so. I'm your biological son. I just found your channel.

1193
04:46:54,490 --> 04:47:21,340
That's so stupid. Yeah. Air, air to the German empire. Okay. So now that I did that, let's

1194
04:47:21,340 --> 04:47:30,060
browse around. You just have, you just don't give a shit at all. Do you?

1195
04:47:31,020 --> 04:47:54,790
You still got it off. I don't think so. Ooh, I think I already have one of those

1196
04:47:55,430 --> 04:48:15,369
germ of his empire. Does this do anything for me? Not really. This one just has more armor.

1197
04:48:15,369 --> 04:48:19,779
This one's better. Are you looking for the whopper secret formula?

1198
04:48:22,700 --> 04:48:41,180
That was actually a pretty good one. All right. So that what's in you.

1199
04:48:42,060 --> 04:48:58,380
When sage glintstone crown, what greatly increases intelligence to the detriment of HP and stamina.

1200
04:49:04,409 --> 04:49:11,340
Oh, I don't want to wear this. This looks awful. It's a double whopper.

1201
04:49:11,979 --> 04:49:21,830
28, 29, 30, 30 is three intelligence really worth losing like almost a hundred in

1202
04:49:21,830 --> 04:49:35,130
HP? I don't know. I don't think so. I really don't. I really don't think so. I got the new

1203
04:49:35,130 --> 04:49:49,259
sword. Oh yeah, that's right. Not as good. Not as good as this scales E with the decks

1204
04:49:55,220 --> 04:49:59,860
deals magic damage. Apparently once you use the staff sorcery, it's got glintstone pebble,

1205
04:50:00,580 --> 04:50:09,909
but I already have that. I already, I already own it. Fuck stats, make a cute outfit,

1206
04:50:14,330 --> 04:50:20,459
make a cute outfit. How many big bosses have you beat? I've done. Okay.

1207
04:50:21,689 --> 04:50:25,290
Uh, how many, actually I, this is a good time to think about this for a second.

1208
04:50:25,849 --> 04:50:43,400
How many bosses have I beaten the game so far? How many like eight, nine and two main? I know

1209
04:50:43,400 --> 04:50:56,220
there's definitely been three or four main. I mean, you need to see this. Uh, I, I see it right now

1210
04:50:56,220 --> 04:51:04,419
and I have, I do and I don't want to show that on stream. It's fucking, I hate it. It's, it's scary.

1211
04:51:08,520 --> 04:51:14,520
This is scary. It looks like my jaw is like unhinged and shit. I don't know. I'm not showing

1212
04:51:14,520 --> 04:51:24,200
that. I'm the streamer. I get to the site. No, it's fucking horrifying. I hate every,

1213
04:51:24,200 --> 04:51:30,630
because you took my real teeth. Are those my real teeth that you just like photoshopped in?

1214
04:51:34,599 --> 04:51:37,159
All right. Maybe that is worth showing on stream because I'm actually really curious.

1215
04:51:39,909 --> 04:51:50,500
Oh, I, this is awful. It looks like a horror game or something. I fucking hate this. This

1216
04:51:50,500 --> 04:52:18,970
is looks scary. It looks like a horror game. Why can't I show? Where is it? I just saved it.

1217
04:52:19,529 --> 04:52:29,500
It's possessed. All right. Well, that's weird. How come I can't show this?

1218
04:52:30,139 --> 04:52:36,779
Oh, I got an, I have an idea. My computer is fucking weird, man. I swear to God.

1219
04:52:37,580 --> 04:52:55,529
Where is it? I just saved it. This doesn't make any sense. It's like there's no images that I have.

1220
04:52:56,650 --> 04:53:03,560
Apparently zero images are on my desktop. What the fuck are you talking about?

1221
04:53:03,560 --> 04:53:27,560
Oh, so my real teeth, I think. Are they? Did you take? No, you didn't. Did you? What did you get

1222
04:53:27,560 --> 04:53:42,090
these teeth? Are they different? They are. I have a little thing here. They are different.

1223
04:53:47,849 --> 04:53:59,099
I hate that. You found somebody. Wait, are these my teeth from like seven or eight years ago?

1224
04:53:59,740 --> 04:54:10,869
It's an AI app. Oh, I thought you took a photo. That would be pretty funny.

1225
04:54:11,669 --> 04:54:15,750
And I don't want to give you content ideas, but like if you had taken like my teeth from

1226
04:54:15,750 --> 04:54:20,950
like a decade ago, like right from like a face cam video from like 10 years ago or something

1227
04:54:21,029 --> 04:54:30,630
and like photoshopped my teeth on it. Look at how fucking I hate it. It's just unsettling and

1228
04:54:30,630 --> 04:54:42,180
makes me feel like shit looking at it. Have your teeth changed? Yeah, I think a little bit. I got

1229
04:54:42,180 --> 04:54:50,360
like a little space here now that I didn't have like seven or eight years ago. My teeth have moved

1230
04:54:50,360 --> 04:55:03,380
a little bit. Okay, so let me get back to this. I don't think it's worth using, but I'll try it

1231
04:55:03,380 --> 04:55:16,360
for a little while. That's pretty cool. All right, so now what? Okay, go back up to the roof.

1232
04:55:18,259 --> 04:55:43,590
I wonder if there's another boss here. It might be. Wait, no. But yeah, so I've beaten like three

1233
04:55:43,590 --> 04:55:54,259
main or four main story bosses. Christ. And what, like five or six just non-story optional bosses?

1234
04:55:54,819 --> 04:56:28,540
You guys don't get up, right? That guy's a crossbow. That was just instant. I thought he

1235
04:56:28,540 --> 04:57:01,419
was going to shoot one. He might drop that. No, please no. 7000 souls. They're gone. Whatever.

1236
04:57:01,419 --> 04:57:34,119
They're gone. Whatever. I didn't want them anyways. Just dead weight. Who hit that guy?

1237
04:57:38,200 --> 04:58:07,459
What the fuck? You gonna cry, bud? What do I think of Elden Ring so far? It's very good.

1238
04:58:08,180 --> 04:58:31,369
About these guys exist. He just. How is he still alive? What the fuck are you talking about? How?

1239
04:58:44,979 --> 04:59:11,049
Oh shit, out of magical power. Right, so now this guy. Long hallway. He fires. I just dodged through

1240
04:59:11,049 --> 04:59:22,919
it. I imagine we're just gonna run at him and he doesn't have a chance. Jesus, man. Okay.

1241
04:59:25,659 --> 04:59:29,700
Damn. I was about to take off my staff and start to play.

1242
04:59:30,419 --> 05:00:41,159
That thing's cool, but I want health. Can't reach. All right. My God. That guy's a pain in the ass.

1243
05:00:41,159 --> 05:00:46,040
I gotta go in there ready. I might just try to block or I mean, he, he, he tried.

1244
05:00:46,840 --> 05:01:23,560
Fuck. What about all these guys? Yeah. Is there something funny?

1245
05:02:20,009 --> 05:02:46,090
Fucking jeez, man. What the fuck? Azure's Glintstone staff. Now this looks to be a real

1246
05:02:46,090 --> 05:03:00,740
staff. One that I am very much excited about. Reduces cast time of all sorceries, but consumes

1247
05:03:00,740 --> 05:03:09,319
more FP. Reduce cast time though. That's huge because of the dexterity I'm building.

1248
05:03:09,319 --> 05:03:29,669
And look at how cool it looks. What does Dex have to do with cast time? In this game,

1249
05:03:29,669 --> 05:03:39,029
in Elden Ring, dexterity reduces cast time. Let me just see what the difference is.

1250
05:03:55,139 --> 05:04:04,680
That's pretty significant. And especially doing dexterity. I think this is the one. I need 52

1251
05:04:04,680 --> 05:04:20,470
intelligence though. It's time to start beefing up. All right. Well, that's really, really cool.

1252
05:04:21,270 --> 05:04:24,310
I, I know there's another place I can go on the rooftops, but I'd like to,

1253
05:04:25,270 --> 05:04:29,509
I've only done one or two real encounters like bosses in the game so far.

1254
05:04:30,229 --> 05:04:32,950
I've spent the last like five hours kind of exploring some of this other stuff.

1255
05:04:34,549 --> 05:04:41,830
I want to try to do this area here. Like it's maybe up, maybe like over here or up here.

1256
05:04:42,470 --> 05:04:53,240
If not there, then I really want to do maybe like up here, this way. Or first of all, I want to go

1257
05:04:53,240 --> 05:05:01,990
here because I think I need to for like progression. I also, I'm going to take a quick break.

1258
05:05:02,630 --> 05:05:12,869
I want to pee. I'll be back. I'll see you guys in a minute. Pee break. And the key, right? I'll mark

1259
05:05:12,869 --> 05:05:19,799
it all. Let me mark it. So everything on the map has significance and something I actually really

1260
05:05:19,799 --> 05:05:33,159
have to do. I'm going to get rid of this because, okay. So it's glintstone key, power place, and then

1261
05:05:33,959 --> 05:05:45,159
up here. These are the places I want to go. And I am going to, I think that's everything I can do

1262
05:05:45,159 --> 05:05:49,400
here. So I'm going to pour it out. I know this probably, there's one other place I didn't go on

1263
05:05:49,400 --> 05:05:55,500
the roof, but you know what? I mean, I got, maybe I'll come back later. I want to progress up

1264
05:05:55,500 --> 05:06:07,900
north more. So we are going to pour it out. I'm going to go here through the main, no, not the

1265
05:06:07,900 --> 05:06:16,939
main gate, like here and go to the tower. I'll be right back. See you guys in a minute.

1266
05:09:31,130 --> 05:09:37,750
I cleared my throat. That's how they know I'm back. Glintstones. Meet the glintstones.

1267
05:09:39,590 --> 05:10:00,569
Modern Stone Age. What kind of tea do you drink? It's matcha. Matcha powder. Green tea. Yep.

1268
05:10:01,209 --> 05:10:27,479
Irma, you're a basic white girl. What? It's, but I like matcha. It's, hey, you know what? Okay.

1269
05:10:28,630 --> 05:10:40,169
Okay. Do you see how, how powerful this is making me? Do you see how powerful this is making me over

1270
05:10:40,169 --> 05:11:00,020
the last four days? Matcha can be enjoyed by anybody and everyone. And I'm going to enjoy

1271
05:11:00,020 --> 05:11:17,189
some right now. I just put a, I just drank a little too much. Matcha, matcha man.

1272
05:11:19,540 --> 05:11:30,459
Matcha, matcha man. I want to be a matcha man. Matcha, matcha, matcha man. That was funny.

1273
05:11:39,639 --> 05:11:48,419
It was for one second, but I, okay. I went a full two seconds too long. It's a type of green tea.

1274
05:11:49,380 --> 05:11:54,630
It had a powder form. Don't overdo it though. It's pretty good for you. Don't, it's, it's got

1275
05:11:54,630 --> 05:11:59,270
caffeine in it. I mean, not as much as like a bunch of like espresso or anything, but

1276
05:11:59,270 --> 05:12:03,560
you know what I mean? Green tea is just good for you anyways. I would recommend people

1277
05:12:03,560 --> 05:12:10,540
be drinking it just regularly anyways, because it's just good for you. The law, it's a different

1278
05:12:10,540 --> 05:12:21,159
like kind of caffeine buzz than you get when you drink coffee. Doesn't have very much. What

1279
05:12:21,159 --> 05:12:25,720
do you like for a brand? I'm still figuring that out. I can't, I can't give you a full

1280
05:12:25,720 --> 05:12:34,810
recommendation yet. I'm still figuring that out. Matcha was not allowed during prohibition.

1281
05:12:35,770 --> 05:12:49,930
All right. We need to go that way. So I got to get on this bridge down here somehow.

1282
05:12:51,590 --> 05:13:13,930
I'm going to go ahead and do the fucking famed castle skip. Nailed it perfectly here. And on

1283
05:13:13,930 --> 05:13:23,819
this bridge over, where's this bridge? And I'm supposed to find that way. Where is it? Where is

1284
05:13:23,819 --> 05:14:11,979
it? I kind of don't know. I came on the wrong side. Let's go to the front door. I don't know.

1285
05:14:11,979 --> 05:14:22,009
I kind of don't know how to get there. Don't aggro the entire village. Front door is probably

1286
05:14:22,009 --> 05:14:42,389
where I need to go. Do they follow me down here? No. Wait, what about that dog with the knife in

1287
05:14:42,389 --> 05:14:49,060
his mouth? You guys know what I'm talking about? Remember that crazy like it had the wolf with like

1288
05:14:49,060 --> 05:15:06,169
a knife in his mouth? He was rammed. Where is that? I think that's right here. Isn't that dog down

1289
05:15:06,169 --> 05:15:19,860
here? Okay. Hold on. Where's that dog? Right there. Right there. Yep. I remember now. Let's kill this

1290
05:15:19,860 --> 05:16:07,000
guy. Okay. Well, God, man. Crush me? Jesus. Imagine even trying to fight this guy like 15, 20 levels

1291
05:16:07,000 --> 05:17:22,659
ago. Kill him. He's in front of you. I didn't dodge. Oh, fuck off. That stupid spin. That like

1292
05:17:22,659 --> 05:17:36,810
little wham at the end. Fuck you. That little like, oh, oops. I'm going to turn instantly and

1293
05:17:36,810 --> 05:17:58,360
hit you. Oh, fuck. I don't want to be here. I want to be here. Yeah. This is stupid. It's just like

1294
05:17:58,360 --> 05:18:06,680
I had it too. That fucker was dead. I could have. Okay. That's why greed is good. I'm never fucking

1295
05:18:06,680 --> 05:18:12,200
not listening to my gut again. I had an opportunity to hit him a third time and kill him, but I was

1296
05:18:12,200 --> 05:18:19,000
like, no, don't do that. That's a bad idea. Don't do that. And I would have, I would have won.

1297
05:18:31,819 --> 05:18:45,319
First of all, I need to put both headphones in because like these fucking guys. I got to get the

1298
05:18:45,319 --> 05:19:23,340
boys in. Why can't I call them? Excuse me. Does it be outside? What even hit me? This fucking dumb

1299
05:19:23,340 --> 05:20:25,799
ass. Get the stupid bow and arrow and shove it up your ass. Fuck you. God damn it. Peace blood,

1300
05:20:25,799 --> 05:20:48,250
old fang. Nice job, boys. Nice work. I'm imagining like a neighbor. No, fuck you.

1301
05:20:49,130 --> 05:20:55,139
Fuck you. No, you can take that bow and arrow and shove it up your ass. Bow and arrow? What's

1302
05:20:55,139 --> 05:21:16,889
happening in there? Okay. This is the way I need to go. What's he talking to? Ooh, this is cool.

1303
05:21:16,889 --> 05:21:33,220
Is this the right way? This is the right way, right? Yeah, it has to be. Ooh, missed an item.

1304
05:21:35,220 --> 05:22:07,430
Did? Where? Missed item. Up your ass. Nice. It's the bow. Over there, dude. What sword is this?

1305
05:22:07,430 --> 05:22:14,020
It is the carrion night sword. Really good if you're doing, uh, if you start as prisoner and you

1306
05:22:14,020 --> 05:22:19,860
really want to be the sorry bastard that says, I want to do just dex and intelligence. It's the

1307
05:22:19,860 --> 05:22:48,169
weapon for you. I like it. I like it so far. Bolt Drake talisman. Lightning damage negation. Okay.

1308
05:22:48,169 --> 05:23:01,540
I wonder. I wonder. I wonder if there's going to be some lightning damage. All right. Give me one

1309
05:23:01,540 --> 05:25:21,049
sec. One sec. I'll be right back. Three seconds. I'll be right back. Cheeseburgers. I told you I was

1310
05:25:21,049 --> 05:25:40,279
going to eat. Wait, both headphones got to go in. He's really got the burger king. I have to play

1311
05:25:40,279 --> 05:26:10,520
the part. Hey, why don't you send somebody that could actually fucking do. Oh, there's two of them.

1312
05:26:10,520 --> 05:26:36,540
Nevermind. There's three of them. Oh shit. Die. Get his power core out of his chest. God, that's way

1313
05:26:37,500 --> 05:26:52,069
easier than I thought it was going to be. How come he doesn't have any? Why does he have more power

1314
05:26:52,069 --> 05:27:39,529
core? How come you get extra power? What happened? The archer with an arrow? Really? I'm going to have

1315
05:27:39,529 --> 05:27:53,799
a greasy cheeseburger controller. I'm not eating like a bag of potato chips. I would, I would

1316
05:27:53,799 --> 05:27:58,040
probably tell you that like just a cheeseburger from like Burger King, McDonald's, Wendy, doesn't

1317
05:27:58,040 --> 05:28:02,840
matter. It's, that's not going to, you get a bun. It's not going to get, it's not grease all over

1318
05:28:02,840 --> 05:28:38,409
the bun. This is bread. You're going to be fine. Burgers are greasy as fuck. Um, not this part.

1319
05:28:39,450 --> 05:28:51,659
This is the part I'm touching. It's dry. It's dry, dry, dry, dry. This is bread. Where are you

1320
05:28:51,659 --> 05:29:18,659
getting your burgers from? Show fingers or you're lying. Fine. Perfectly fine. Show the other hand.

1321
05:29:18,659 --> 05:29:37,029
Fine. There's nothing on there. This is going to make, this is going to power me up for at least

1322
05:29:37,029 --> 05:30:02,819
another two, three hours at least. I guess there's a teleporter. What about over here? Disgusting

1323
05:30:02,819 --> 05:30:14,500
Daniel. It's easy. It's quick, fast. All right. I'm not, I'm not going to eat steak on dinner

1324
05:30:14,500 --> 05:30:19,430
on stream, but you, I'm not going to eat like a piece of salmon on camera.

1325
05:30:19,430 --> 05:30:56,900
Where's, I've been into a gross part. I've been into a gross part. I had, I had to get out, I had

1326
05:30:56,900 --> 05:31:41,450
to get out of my mouth. Ooh, cotton. Asher Forest scarab. It's like, like the, all right. Increases

1327
05:31:41,450 --> 05:32:03,290
damage taken, but reduces the FP costs of Asher's work. You guys know how it is. Sometimes you're

1328
05:32:03,290 --> 05:32:16,180
just biting into like kind of a gross part and you want to get it out. Why are you eating by

1329
05:32:16,180 --> 05:32:38,729
taking bites out of your table? I'm like eating my desk. It shouldn't be gross parts of things I'm

1330
05:32:38,729 --> 05:32:50,139
eating. Sometimes you bite into a gross part and you have to go like, oh, so I know some of you get

1331
05:32:50,139 --> 05:33:41,380
it. It's like two gross parts. Let me explain. Let me explain for all the people here that are

1332
05:33:41,380 --> 05:33:54,860
yelling at me. Let me explain. When you eat something that has a consistent texture across

1333
05:33:54,860 --> 05:34:03,770
the board, you know what each bite feels like. You know, the texture, you know, the give when

1334
05:34:03,770 --> 05:34:12,250
it's something off about that. When the texture changes in one of the bites, you kind of have to

1335
05:34:12,250 --> 05:34:26,979
say, well, that's something that different there. That's kind of weird. You get it. Okay.

1336
05:34:28,099 --> 05:34:48,380
I'm ready. Oh my God. That sounded so awful. You ready? Here we go. Um, it's, it was fine.

1337
05:34:49,340 --> 05:35:06,169
Nothing wrong with it. He's actually attacked. What's the Eagles? If you need,

1338
05:35:06,169 --> 05:35:26,889
Hey, you need Eagle feathers. They're here. I was talking to me. I was making a reference to me.

1339
05:35:26,889 --> 05:35:29,770
Like, Hey, if you need them, they're here. Idiot. Like talking to shit, like Jeremy,

1340
05:35:29,770 --> 05:35:46,779
like self-referential humor, dude, they don't stop moving. I'm trying to drink out of something

1341
05:35:46,779 --> 05:36:17,900
that's empty. Okay. So what's at the very end? Was there no reason to come down here? Oh,

1342
05:36:17,900 --> 05:36:43,259
fuck. Really? There's nothing over here. You fuck. That's really pretty. Invisible bridge.

1343
05:36:43,259 --> 05:37:03,240
I'm not walking over an invisible bridge. I, uh, it can't get your horse here. Uh, what?

1344
05:37:11,080 --> 05:37:17,450
Invisible bridge crew. There they are. There they are. They've made themselves known.

1345
05:37:18,900 --> 05:37:35,029
There's invisible bridge crew. Stop burping. Divine tower of living grave. How do I open it?

1346
05:37:35,029 --> 05:38:05,049
Like that. Right in the center. Very nice. Wait, I didn't read whatever that was. I bet you can't,

1347
05:38:05,049 --> 05:39:21,270
I bet you can't not talk for one minute. Try me. Ready? Three, two, one, begin. I won.

1348
05:39:29,299 --> 05:39:40,220
I won. It's my prize. All right. For five minutes now. I've already done this. All right.

1349
05:39:40,779 --> 05:39:49,669
I'll do it for five minutes. I'm going to wait till the clock strikes 5 41, five hours and 41

1350
05:39:49,669 --> 05:39:55,369
minutes and I'll start. You already did this. Yeah, I know. That's what I'm saying. We already did

1351
05:39:55,369 --> 05:40:06,810
this. Be quiet for the rest of the entire stream. Well, if you would, I'll just leave. Everybody

1352
05:40:06,810 --> 05:40:26,200
would leave. There'd be nobody here. Oh, it's a finger. It's a dead two fingers. Restore the

1353
05:40:26,200 --> 05:40:51,770
power of the great rune. Rodrick's great rune. What does that do? Raises all attributes? Excuse

1354
05:40:51,770 --> 05:41:05,430
me. What are you talking about? Raises all attributes. How do I use this? You equip this

1355
05:41:05,430 --> 05:41:22,009
at the bonfire. Oh shit. Okay. Oh yeah. Is that, I think that's everything I can do here, right?

1356
05:41:22,569 --> 05:41:28,889
That's one thing done. Let's go do it. Is there any detriment to doing it?

1357
05:41:29,450 --> 05:41:44,900
Does it do anything? Is there like a, you just do it. Great runes. The great rune menu,

1358
05:41:44,900 --> 05:41:50,810
you can equip great runes that have had their power restored. You can use a rune arc to give

1359
05:41:50,810 --> 05:42:02,139
even greater benefits to your equipped great runes. Raises all attributes. By how much?

1360
05:42:02,860 --> 05:42:24,819
Did it do anything? I have to use a rune arc? It's, I have to use a rune arc. Um, it doesn't,

1361
05:42:24,819 --> 05:42:36,419
it doesn't do. Oh, I get it. So you equip it. You take a rune arc and that gives you,

1362
05:42:36,500 --> 05:42:48,259
okay. And then when you die, it's gone, right? That just, it's a humanity. Okay. Well,

1363
05:42:48,259 --> 05:42:53,740
I have no idea what the hell I'm going to use that. Anything else to do in here?

1364
05:42:54,459 --> 05:43:20,659
See power from remembrance. Purchase. Queen's robe. What does this do? Do I get any benefit

1365
05:43:20,659 --> 05:43:29,639
for wearing any of this stuff? Or is it just passion souls? There's new, uh, intelligence

1366
05:43:29,639 --> 05:43:32,360
stuff, right? The hat gives intelligence.

1367
05:43:36,860 --> 05:43:37,580
Feel her look.

1368
05:44:04,310 --> 05:44:16,709
I'm sorry. I mean, at some point you got to shave it all off.

1369
05:44:19,110 --> 05:44:21,750
It just doesn't look good. At some point you just got to get rid of it all.

1370
05:44:39,029 --> 05:44:45,240
Stop looking at it. So I have like eight, so I'm like,

1371
05:44:45,720 --> 05:44:54,790
yeah. You have anything new? No, I got everything I need from you. Thanks for the weapon, by the way.

1372
05:44:56,459 --> 05:45:07,689
Dumbass. All right. It's time to do step two. Step two was to go give this guy the key.

1373
05:45:10,470 --> 05:45:22,020
Step three, get the boys to plus 10. Did you eat without drinking? No, I got a drinker.

1374
05:45:22,580 --> 05:45:44,380
I really do wonder what this does, but I was going to kill me. Look what I got. I've got

1375
05:45:44,380 --> 05:45:58,729
something special for you. Give Adam the key. Yes, I am. Your soul.

1376
05:46:10,520 --> 05:46:26,470
It's kind of a Sims cry. Okay, so what? I will depart for the academy.

1377
05:46:33,450 --> 05:46:42,419
Decorated soul center by then. He's there now. I already bought everything he has.

1378
05:46:50,419 --> 05:46:58,229
Okay, so should I go back to the... Where is he? Now go find him in the academy?

1379
05:46:59,400 --> 05:47:11,060
Dude, this is gonna take fucking forever. Where would he be? Grand library? He's gonna die in

1380
05:47:11,060 --> 05:47:20,069
there. He's literally gonna die. Does he know that everyone's gone mad and he's gonna die?

1381
05:47:40,380 --> 05:47:46,540
Outside the classroom? This dude... Okay, this dude's definitely gonna be... Okay, here we go.

1382
05:47:46,540 --> 05:47:51,180
Here's my prediction. I'm gonna go to the classroom and he's gonna be lying face down

1383
05:47:51,180 --> 05:48:01,770
with an item on his back. Dead. That's what's gonna happen. He's just gonna be lying on the ground.

1384
05:48:02,569 --> 05:48:30,950
Okay, where are you at? Is he out here? I told you he was dead. I told you he was gonna be dead.

1385
05:48:30,950 --> 05:48:38,139
He's just sitting here. He didn't... Thop's bell bearing? An academy glintstone? Thop's barrier?

1386
05:48:40,680 --> 05:48:48,500
He's just dead. What killed him? This doesn't look like it was a murder. This looks like he

1387
05:48:48,500 --> 05:48:56,680
kind of just died in the chair. And by the way, how did you do all this out here? How did he get

1388
05:48:56,680 --> 05:49:10,220
in there to get all this equipment? It's like cold out here. He just got here. He just got here. We

1389
05:49:10,220 --> 05:49:18,340
said goodbye. He teleported here. He sat in the chair and just fucking died. All right, what was

1390
05:49:18,340 --> 05:49:27,180
all that stuff? Academy staff, which you already had. Thop's blessing or something. Whatever the

1391
05:49:27,180 --> 05:49:39,259
hell that was. What was... Oops. What was it called? Oops, bell bearing. Offered to twin maiden

1392
05:49:39,340 --> 05:49:57,290
husks for new item access. Okay, and then Thop's shield? Thop's barrier. A lifelong pursuit of

1393
05:49:57,290 --> 05:50:02,650
Thop's the blunt stone. Creates a magic force field that deflects sorceries and incantations.

1394
05:50:02,650 --> 05:50:17,930
Hold to continuously create barriers. Interesting. So it's an anti-magic shield. Okay, I'm willing to

1395
05:50:17,930 --> 05:50:29,099
try it. Well, thanks a lot, Thop. It was another place I needed to go. There it is. All right.

1396
05:50:29,819 --> 05:50:37,750
Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, we are now going to progress up through northern

1397
05:50:37,750 --> 05:50:59,419
Lunaria Lake up this way. We're gonna go into this abandoned room right now, but not yet. Not yet.

1398
05:50:59,419 --> 05:51:05,290
Some unfinished business that needs to be taken care of. Are you high? Stop fucking blowing my

1399
05:51:05,290 --> 05:51:16,299
spot up, dude. Come on. I wouldn't fucking do that to you. Okay, so first of all, I need to see if

1400
05:51:16,299 --> 05:51:35,110
I can upgrade this weapon, because it's been a while. Zomber smithing stone five. Although I can

1401
05:51:35,110 --> 05:51:50,950
do this. This has to replace this, right? But I need 52 intelligence. All right.

1402
05:51:50,950 --> 05:52:29,369
That's plus one. Okay, oleg. I can just get oleg up and get him ready. Who else should I do this to?

1403
05:52:29,369 --> 05:52:33,930
The dogs? The dogs have been pretty useful. Or should I save it just in case? I guess I can get

1404
05:52:33,930 --> 05:52:50,069
everybody, right? Most of them? Never skip oleg day. You use the dogs once. I need grave glove

1405
05:52:50,069 --> 05:53:21,849
for it too. Or I'll probably run into it soon. I think that's all I can do. Oh, that's right.

1406
05:53:28,860 --> 05:53:52,310
New items. I want to know what that person's problem is. Here, take this. Offer bell bearing.

1407
05:53:52,310 --> 05:54:03,610
Offer thops bell bearing. Bell bearing shop one? Wait, it just puts his items here?

1408
05:54:08,520 --> 05:54:17,099
I already bought his shit. What the fuck did that guy do for me? He gave me a little rinky-dink

1409
05:54:17,180 --> 05:54:47,909
barrier spell. What's a memory slot? A memory card? Oh, it's for spells. Watch that spell

1410
05:54:47,909 --> 05:55:04,229
be incredible. Uh, let's see. Okay, I haven't done this. I don't know. What do I do? Okay, I'm gonna...

1411
05:55:08,040 --> 05:55:25,380
Does it matter? How many of these I can make? All right, I'll make like the liver thing that's like,

1412
05:55:25,380 --> 05:55:32,889
oh, you boost fire damage reduction, right? Or like, uh, blood loss. I don't think I can put

1413
05:55:32,889 --> 05:55:44,619
these on my weapon. I can't even use these. I can't coat this weapon with anything. It's already

1414
05:55:44,619 --> 05:55:56,619
coated with magical power. I'll make... Okay, I'm gonna make... I'll make four of those. Yeah, I did

1415
05:55:56,619 --> 05:56:03,450
it. I crafted things. Because if there's a fire boss or something, I can just take it. Buy the

1416
05:56:03,450 --> 05:56:21,750
spell slot. Coat it with matcha powder. I sold... Okay, I'm gonna sell some stuff. See if I can get

1417
05:56:21,750 --> 05:56:46,150
a three thousand. Buy the memory slot. All right, what's this bullshit that I don't want?

1418
05:56:46,869 --> 05:56:54,540
I'm not gonna use a great axe, so I'm scared of it. Alam's Halvard. Imagine dual welding these.

1419
05:56:54,540 --> 05:57:10,549
That's funny, but not me. Uh, I have two of these, so why do I have two of them? Okay. I am never

1420
05:57:10,549 --> 05:57:19,259
going to use these. I'm just gonna get rid of them. I have no... There's no point in keeping these.

1421
05:57:31,049 --> 05:57:48,840
I have 99 of these? That's a thousand souls. Where did I get three brass shields from?

1422
05:57:48,840 --> 05:58:15,560
All right, that should get me... Okay, now I can afford... What was it? Four thousand?

1423
05:58:16,680 --> 05:58:21,500
Or is it three thousand? I can have another spell.

1424
05:58:27,900 --> 05:58:37,860
I love the blue. Yeah, it looks great. Well, not that one. This one. I want to show it off.

1425
05:58:39,159 --> 05:58:46,229
Well, I can't. I tried to play this game, but I burnt my PC. It exploded.

1426
05:58:47,619 --> 05:58:55,830
I'll get it on PlayStation 4 or Xbox. All right, here it is.

1427
05:58:57,990 --> 05:59:18,650
Priest memory slots. So now I have four. I'll try it. Let me try this, and let's take

1428
05:59:19,770 --> 05:59:26,700
gravity off, and we'll try the real... Okay, I did this guy's entire quest line, and actually,

1429
05:59:26,700 --> 05:59:46,549
I want to move these around. I want the two damage weapons to be here, because I want this to be

1430
05:59:46,549 --> 06:00:04,380
this. This to be this. Okay, I'll try it. Bedtime? It is not my bedtime. It is time to go.

1431
06:00:05,180 --> 06:00:29,080
Nothing else to clean up. I'm ready. I'm making noises? I can't help it. People think that I just

1432
06:00:29,080 --> 06:00:34,439
do this because I'm on stream. I just do this in like the bathtub. I'll be in the bathtub just

1433
06:00:34,439 --> 06:00:46,569
going like... I'm a bird. I'm like a weird parrot thing. I actually think I might have been a bird.

1434
06:00:47,290 --> 06:00:51,740
You don't ask why birds do that shit, because they just do, and it's not like, hey, birds,

1435
06:00:51,740 --> 06:00:55,900
shut the fuck up. Why are you making sounds? They sing their songs, and everybody loves them.

1436
06:00:56,459 --> 06:01:11,209
What have you ever told a bird to shut the fuck up? Just being real. King's Realm Ruins.

1437
06:01:12,540 --> 06:01:32,020
Cool. Not enough of that. Not about enough of that.

1438
06:01:41,779 --> 06:01:48,810
Ah, EZ, forgive me. These Royal Guards grounds were placed in our trust, but we stood no chance.

1439
06:01:54,299 --> 06:02:18,970
I just like farted in the bathtub. Can I be real with everybody for a second? Who else is afraid

1440
06:02:20,569 --> 06:02:26,569
to fart in the bathtub, because you're afraid you're going to shit, like you're going to shit

1441
06:02:26,569 --> 06:02:36,040
your pants, or shit the tub, and like shit in the tub, because I am. Like, oh, I think I'm going to

1442
06:02:36,040 --> 06:02:42,840
go ahead and just do this. Like, what if you just like shit? I've had plenty of accidents over the

1443
06:02:42,840 --> 06:03:01,299
years. Not in the tub. That's not going to happen. That's why I can't be on camera. No one asked this.

1444
06:03:01,299 --> 06:03:17,459
I know. I'm sorry. What the fuck? You've been streaming? No, I'm fine. Relax. What an Andy.

1445
06:03:17,459 --> 06:03:29,159
You didn't even say what kind of Andy. What the hell? Um, there's something under here.

1446
06:03:32,380 --> 06:03:52,580
It's probably a dungeon. So now my sorceries are stronger here. What's this? What's this one?

1447
06:03:53,459 --> 06:04:21,240
Why does this seem like a shield? It's a spell parry? Hold it. Yeah, I am. I'm holding it right

1448
06:04:21,240 --> 06:04:38,659
now. I wonder what that is. Does it hurt other people? I'll try it. But let me see if there's

1449
06:04:38,659 --> 06:05:03,509
anything under there. There's a ruin here. It takes too fucking long. How am I supposed to

1450
06:05:03,509 --> 06:05:19,720
parry this? All right, congratulations. Stop. Uh, you got a fucking blintstone key for literally

1451
06:05:19,720 --> 06:05:50,090
no reason. All right, let me find out what this is. We're looking for a way to go down in the

1452
06:05:50,090 --> 06:06:25,419
dungeon. I saw it right here. That guy. Where is it? Where is it? Where is it? I need to find it.

1453
06:06:25,979 --> 06:06:57,369
I must find it. Find I if you haven't seen any of those stuff. What the fuck is that?

1454
06:06:58,090 --> 06:07:05,369
They're reading a book. That's huge guys. They're just reading a book.

1455
06:07:06,009 --> 06:07:35,720
Is that an NPC? What's your name? We don't receive many visitors. I presume you are.

1456
06:07:35,720 --> 06:07:53,700
What brings you here? This guy's got an anvil. It's hardly my place to ask, is it? I am EG,

1457
06:07:54,500 --> 06:08:06,330
a blacksmith who once served the Carian Royals. Still quietly ply my trade on this spot.

1458
06:08:07,130 --> 06:08:14,090
Perhaps you'd like a display. These bones are old, but still able.

1459
06:08:16,360 --> 06:08:28,500
This is not the blacksmith. Oh, come on, dude. Really? I need somersmithing stone five.

1460
06:08:28,500 --> 06:08:32,580
You have up to four. You don't have five.

1461
06:09:32,090 --> 06:09:53,029
I have that sword. All right, well, you've got those, but you don't have the ones I need.

1462
06:09:57,450 --> 06:10:02,169
Enchanted snare, day away from that death trap.

1463
06:10:03,049 --> 06:10:07,990
Well, I'm not going to listen to a single word you said and I'm going to go get killed

1464
06:10:07,990 --> 06:10:21,830
probably two to three hundred more times. Have a good one. This is where I look over at him and

1465
06:10:21,830 --> 06:11:04,659
he just goes. I don't know why I'm going this way, but I decided to go this way. Oh, hell yeah.

1466
06:11:04,659 --> 06:11:48,139
Oh my goodness. Look at all this. Very nice. Is it maybe the back door? Maybe there is a back door.

1467
06:11:48,139 --> 06:12:03,459
Oh, that does not look like a back entrance. It's not a back door. Can I do anything with

1468
06:12:03,459 --> 06:12:28,630
this big rock formation? I don't think so. Cool looking rock. Here it comes. No,

1469
06:12:28,630 --> 06:12:44,599
it's not coming. I want to get off the horse because I don't think I can turn well.

1470
06:12:46,520 --> 06:12:58,630
Turning there, I probably would have fall down. It's so fucking pretty. It's so cool looking.

1471
06:12:58,630 --> 06:13:08,409
All right. All right. Let's just go on the front door. Who cares? Give me the fucking item.

1472
06:13:08,970 --> 06:13:55,819
There's a lake over there. All right. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1473
06:13:56,459 --> 06:14:30,310
I just checked the other side. No, we'll go front door. We made it. Lock raid. Oh,

1474
06:14:30,310 --> 06:14:44,060
I thought somebody actually raided Aria Manor. That's terrifying. Is that a hand?

1475
06:14:51,029 --> 06:15:06,549
Fucking. Oh, fucking. It is a hand.

1476
06:15:31,509 --> 06:15:33,750
All right. The pinky fingers of the other. They can't do anything.

1477
06:15:42,490 --> 06:15:52,380
Somersmithing stone too. I need a five. Please. I don't like that either. Yeah. It's disgusting.

1478
06:16:01,830 --> 06:16:48,919
We'll check over here first. Linstone craftsman's cookbook. Okay. Magic grease,

1479
06:16:49,560 --> 06:16:53,509
raw string magic grease. I just don't think I can use any of it.

1480
06:16:54,150 --> 06:17:16,939
That was heartless. Was it though? I have that too. I just can't use it.

1481
06:17:31,750 --> 06:17:40,259
Oh, they're like booby traps. Okay. Spitting stone three. No fives.

1482
06:17:58,229 --> 06:18:44,520
Minus two and a three. There's other little hands. Oops. Get your little friends out of here.

1483
06:18:47,270 --> 06:19:14,299
Very bad. God damn it. Fuck off. You can't be kidding me. Dude, I'm stuck in the fucking.

1484
06:19:14,299 --> 06:19:21,060
I can't get out of here. What was I stuck on? What was it? What was on me? What was in the way?

1485
06:19:21,060 --> 06:20:34,490
I'm just gonna fucking run out of this shit. That is way too slow. Way too slow. Shit, man.

1486
06:20:34,490 --> 06:20:40,500
Do I really have to fight two of these guys at the same goddamn time? Holy shit. Fuck this area.

1487
06:20:41,459 --> 06:21:19,400
Oh. Oh. Whoa. There he is. You fucker. I was looking around for him.

1488
06:21:20,119 --> 06:21:35,430
Actually, I was looking for him and I couldn't see him. Did he come out of the ground? Fucking

1489
06:21:35,430 --> 06:21:56,220
worst enemy in the game. It's like so hard to tell what part of his hand is attacking you. It's like

1490
06:21:56,220 --> 06:22:01,509
it's such a weird fucking way to attack. I can't, I like, I don't know which one of his fingers is

1491
06:22:01,509 --> 06:22:53,959
gonna fucking swing at me. It's like half of his hand attacks you. Oh my fucking God. I'm gonna

1492
06:22:53,959 --> 06:23:26,979
kill this guy because I'm fucking mad. Fuck you for being in here. Oh, I'm dead because of so much

1493
06:23:26,979 --> 06:23:42,700
health. What a shit enemy. I don't want to fight any more of these guys. I'm literally just walking

1494
06:23:42,700 --> 06:24:38,740
by him. Rimmed crystal bud. All right, that's it. I missed so much shit over there, but I don't care.

1495
06:24:39,459 --> 06:25:39,459
I'm in severe concentration mode. I gotta run in and pray for a bonfire. That almost just fucking

1496
06:25:40,180 --> 06:25:54,979
bonfire. Bonfire? It can't come in here. Oh, are you gonna do that again? No. Lady Rani,

1497
06:25:54,979 --> 06:26:01,139
we have long awaited you. I pray for your house's swift revival. May the full moon shine upon Karya.

1498
06:26:01,779 --> 06:26:12,680
You gonna do PvP? Um, I don't know. Not in the immediate future. Maybe eventually.

1499
06:26:15,900 --> 06:26:53,099
Maybe after a little while. I want to beat the game. Okay, examine this area. You're not fucking

1500
06:26:53,099 --> 06:26:57,740
hands. I don't want to fight those hands anymore. They're the worst.

1501
06:27:06,700 --> 06:27:10,619
As long as you guys don't have like fingers crawling out of your eyeballs and shit. I don't

1502
06:27:10,619 --> 06:27:30,180
care. I'll fight all of you. Will you lock on please? This is an ugly place to fight.

1503
06:27:48,790 --> 06:28:21,860
Don't fall off. Don't roll off. What? What? What? What? What? I didn't hit him? What? Did he? Was

1504
06:28:21,860 --> 06:28:28,900
his foot a centimeter away? Every time I'm a centimeter away, I get hit by that bullshit.

1505
06:28:29,540 --> 06:29:13,159
A lot of things went wrong there. Suck my ass. I almost jumped off the edge. I'm fucking sweating.

1506
06:29:13,799 --> 06:29:39,830
Okay, what about this way? Let's go this way first. Watch out for their magic.

1507
06:29:49,159 --> 06:30:10,619
Why are the trees moving? This tree is moving weirdly. Like it's gonna lift up and it's gonna

1508
06:30:10,619 --> 06:30:27,479
be a guy's face. I was waiting for the tree to do something. I thought it was gonna be,

1509
06:30:27,479 --> 06:30:37,189
I thought it was a guy's hair. He's gonna be like, and just fucking smash me.

1510
06:30:37,750 --> 06:31:38,490
Did you do the goofy goober dance? My mistake was going there in the first place.

1511
06:31:38,490 --> 06:32:18,520
Guess what the hell was over there? A rune arc? Who gives a shit? Yoch! Yoch! Yoch! Huh? Oh you

1512
06:32:18,520 --> 06:32:48,810
fucker. There's no stagger with this guy. I'm not putting up with him. Okay, so I just got punished

1513
06:32:48,810 --> 06:32:56,250
for going over there because everybody just collapsed on me. Am I tripping over a mine or

1514
06:32:56,250 --> 06:33:05,349
something? Am I summoning them? How am I, how is this happening? Am I spawning them? I feel like

1515
06:33:05,349 --> 06:33:13,000
I'm spawning them. I'm spawning them. They're being spawned when I cross a certain threshold,

1516
06:33:13,080 --> 06:33:19,159
like a certain spawn area. Or did they just, maybe they just do it randomly always? I don't know.

1517
06:33:19,159 --> 06:33:36,310
Interesting. Very interesting. Yeah, I'm not gonna get fooled by that. Nope, no, I'm sorry.

1518
06:33:37,669 --> 06:34:04,169
Not, not after like 25 minutes here. Holy shit! That sucks absolute balls. I'm gonna run.

1519
06:34:17,060 --> 06:35:26,360
Relax. Get that shit out of here. I'm the right firing. Really? Are you serious dude? Fuck you.

1520
06:35:26,919 --> 06:35:33,750
I'm sitting there paying attention to the guy back here shooting from a hundred miles away.

1521
06:35:33,750 --> 06:35:38,520
I have to kill him now because, yeah, I just spawned like three people probably.

1522
06:35:41,080 --> 06:36:03,610
Yeah, I fucking knew it. You fateful shit. How dare you. Fuck you. Oh, fuck you. I don't want

1523
06:36:03,610 --> 06:36:26,090
to fight him. I'm running to the door. I'm just checking for items. I just need to see if there's

1524
06:36:26,090 --> 06:36:55,270
items. Oh, see you later. Thank god. Oh my goodness. That was horrible. That was so scary.

1525
06:36:55,270 --> 06:37:16,060
It was so awful. And the hand was fucked. Fuck those hands. Oh, I can upgrade my class. I have

1526
06:37:16,060 --> 06:37:20,860
to go back to that area later. I don't want to go back to that fucking place. I don't like

1527
06:37:20,860 --> 06:37:25,659
those hands. They're too freaky. They're freaky. Like super like freaky freaky. I don't like it.

1528
06:37:29,299 --> 06:38:03,209
Too freaky. Way too freaky. So there's a summoning stone thing there. I wonder if there's

1529
06:38:03,209 --> 06:38:38,220
something here. That was a little bit different move. Really? That was kind of a different move.

1530
06:39:25,689 --> 06:39:36,810
God, he's just bouncing around. What is this fucking move set? He looks like he's lagging.

1531
06:39:36,810 --> 06:40:07,319
He has like 3000 fucking ping. He's like, God, what am I connecting to? Are the boys plus 10?

1532
06:40:07,319 --> 06:40:14,119
We need way more materials to get the boys to plus 10 that I just I do not have. We need like

1533
06:40:15,419 --> 06:40:29,130
what I got the boys to plus one. That's as far as I could get. You will regret upgrading the boys.

1534
06:40:29,130 --> 06:40:34,009
I probably will because like literally the first that's the first item that you get in the game.

1535
06:40:34,009 --> 06:40:46,779
I think that's like the first item. Oh shit. Headphones are going in for this one. I'll

1536
06:40:46,779 --> 06:41:20,060
leg up here. Seems safer. But again, there's always these old guys that just die in one hit.

1537
06:41:23,450 --> 06:41:27,500
I don't think these guys even know that they're here. They're kind of just wandering around with

1538
06:41:27,500 --> 06:41:39,909
a stick that they found on the ground. And when they go like this stuff comes out and they just

1539
06:41:39,909 --> 06:41:45,290
go, I guess I'll do that to people. All right. Yeah, I'm not fighting the giant knight.

1540
06:41:47,020 --> 06:41:55,639
If I can get behind him. Well, I'm killing them because they're attacking me.

1541
06:41:56,279 --> 06:42:00,229
They're trying to kill me. I'm just defending myself.

1542
06:42:13,139 --> 06:42:22,520
Geez. I don't I mean that guy has that guy is just a big version of me.

1543
06:42:25,930 --> 06:42:47,909
I don't have. I can't fight that guy right now. There's a fire up here. Maybe.

1544
06:42:49,029 --> 06:42:53,880
Oh my fucking God. It's a guy with one of those things. He's got one of these things.

1545
06:42:55,080 --> 06:42:58,790
Oh my God. Fireworks just went by my screen.

1546
06:43:27,770 --> 06:44:08,200
Duck. Okay. Um, I don't know if I want to go there.

1547
06:44:08,919 --> 06:44:14,490
It looks like a new area. That is a pot down there. You're right. That's a pretty, that's a

1548
06:44:14,490 --> 06:44:28,119
Pog pot. Oh, thank God. Oh my goodness. I'm saved. Actually saved right there.

1549
06:44:29,689 --> 06:45:04,119
Okay. Now I don't feel as bad as a boss without a without a doubt. I have 8,000 souls.

1550
06:45:04,119 --> 06:45:18,500
I'm not going for it. I'd rather fall down here, die and spawn there and run over here.

1551
06:45:18,500 --> 06:45:56,650
I'm going to check over here first. It seems safer to me somehow.

1552
06:45:56,650 --> 06:46:01,369
Oh shit. They all came over. Oh my God. They're everywhere.

1553
06:46:01,369 --> 06:46:03,610
They're fucking everywhere. They're everywhere.

1554
06:46:23,819 --> 06:46:29,340
The cracked pot. Is that it? Can I go anywhere from here though?

1555
06:46:29,340 --> 06:46:33,459
I think this is, can I get out of here? How do I get out of here?

1556
06:46:35,819 --> 06:46:56,409
Why would I go that way? Is there a door? Shit. All right. This is pot village.

1557
06:47:05,270 --> 06:47:10,790
I don't want to go to hand town. Everything has to be a town or a village. Oh, a hand place.

1558
06:47:11,509 --> 06:47:17,619
Pot town, pot village, pot world, hand world, hand city.

1559
06:47:18,180 --> 06:47:26,279
I'm just trying to make sure this is safe because look at my health.

1560
06:47:26,279 --> 06:47:44,180
Oh, that was almost not safe. What do you, what's behind you?

1561
06:47:45,659 --> 06:47:46,380
There's something behind.

1562
06:48:17,849 --> 06:48:38,650
Even think about it. All this way for something that might be good.

1563
06:48:40,360 --> 06:48:46,090
All this way. God damn it. What is that?

1564
06:48:46,569 --> 06:49:01,860
Oh shit. I'm fine. Hand, hand, hand. Oh, I need to teleport. How do I teleport? I gotta kill this.

1565
06:49:02,979 --> 06:49:32,650
Okay. Very important. Did I do this yet? I did already. Okay. I think I have enough to level up.

1566
06:49:34,860 --> 06:49:45,930
I definitely do. That was insane. That was, my heart is just like exploding.

1567
06:49:46,810 --> 06:49:59,209
13, 14, 15. Okay, that's enough. That was an absolute roller coaster. It really was.

1568
06:50:02,700 --> 06:50:07,340
Uh, mind is the easy one here because it gets us closer to Oleg.

1569
06:50:09,110 --> 06:50:29,319
Or I gotta start pumping intelligence. All right. So that was that.

1570
06:50:29,319 --> 06:50:34,200
That was that whole chain of events took us that way. So now I'm not completely uncomfortable

1571
06:50:35,509 --> 06:50:43,020
going, uh, this way now, which I want to see what's in that boss room.

1572
06:50:43,020 --> 06:50:57,830
I'm very, very, very curious. What about the new spell? Oh yeah. I'll look at it too.

1573
06:50:57,830 --> 06:51:09,580
It's a good call. Oh, you know what? No, let's, let's go for this. Might as well. It's right here.

1574
06:51:21,509 --> 06:51:24,229
He can't fit through this door. So like I can get rid of these,

1575
06:51:24,869 --> 06:51:31,299
I can get rid of these idiots and he can't get through here and then it'll be a one-on-one

1576
06:51:36,889 --> 06:51:39,849
or I'll just fucking die. That's one way that could happen.

1577
06:51:45,669 --> 06:51:57,740
Hey, um, so that would have been okay. Uh, I should have done the big sword move,

1578
06:52:04,250 --> 06:52:09,159
which I want to make sure it's there. Okay. The big sword works really well on those guys.

1579
06:52:10,889 --> 06:52:14,009
And I have to get rid of the, in case that happens again, just kill the dog.

1580
06:52:14,009 --> 06:52:58,459
The dog is gone. I can pull them back here if I need to. Okay. Now let's try this again.

1581
06:52:59,020 --> 06:53:35,299
In fact, here, just like, fuck you buddy. Now you come with me. Really? Get over here.

1582
06:53:35,299 --> 06:54:41,740
Okay. Now you. Boys, where am I? Shit. Oh boy. That's not good. Oh, he just

1583
06:54:41,740 --> 06:55:11,450
bumped into the wall. No, get him. Oh shit. Oh my God. I didn't dodge. Oh shit. Where are they?

1584
06:55:20,900 --> 06:56:24,970
Oh my God. Your moves don't, I don't know how to time them. Hey, this is a cult. Oh man. Really?

1585
06:56:28,009 --> 06:56:41,529
No shit. Wow. It's a magic strength. Dex scaling weapon. What does that sound like?

1586
06:56:41,529 --> 06:56:56,470
That sounds like somebody. I don't know who. All right. Well, that's really cool. I don't know.

1587
06:56:56,470 --> 06:57:12,840
How much help do I have? None. I mean, there's, there's really no point to me. I just go back

1588
06:57:12,840 --> 06:57:32,569
to the bonfire, right? Like, what's the point of me doing this to die? Your German, bro,

1589
06:57:32,569 --> 06:57:42,979
heal, bro. German, bro, heal, bro. I'm all right. Well, that was intense. Now we do the fun thing

1590
06:57:42,979 --> 06:57:47,700
where I go look at the boss and then figure out if I am too burnt out to continue to play.

1591
06:57:48,900 --> 06:57:58,500
I'm definitely feeling it. I'm definitely starting to feel the, uh, or like 42 straight hours of

1592
06:57:58,500 --> 06:58:05,380
playing this game. Uh, I'm starting to kind of burn out a little. Mach of burnout. Yeah. I'm

1593
06:58:05,380 --> 06:58:16,540
getting some mach of burnout here. 42 straight hours. I know that I'm kidding.

1594
06:58:17,880 --> 06:58:25,610
How long has it been? 37, 35, 38 hours straight. Essentially sleeping in between

1595
06:58:26,490 --> 06:58:30,009
and like morning errands and, you know, going to the bathroom.

1596
06:58:30,729 --> 06:58:44,819
Okay. What's going on here? What is this? Royal Knight Loretta. Do I get a horse too? Where's

1597
06:58:44,819 --> 06:59:52,490
my horse? Where's my horse? Oh, that was a new move. That was a one, two. Thankfully it's right

1598
06:59:52,490 --> 07:00:19,860
here. I wonder if you stay on his, uh, right side. Ooh, okay. That's a little, that's a little snipe.

1599
07:00:20,819 --> 07:00:48,299
All right. Yeah. I got to stay on his other side. Yeah. He's a pain in the ass if he can't swing

1600
07:00:48,299 --> 07:01:47,159
this way. Oh, you fucking idiot. Oh, I have the gravestone behind me. I really, really, really

1601
07:01:47,159 --> 07:01:55,049
need to go find a flask upgrade. I think, I think I might have to do some flask upgrade after this.

1602
07:01:56,009 --> 07:02:23,450
Okay. Dude, dude, what? Okay. Do something else. Shit. He's not that bad. I'll get him.

1603
07:02:24,169 --> 07:02:38,599
Unless it's like a phase two, which he knows. All right. So, okay. He spins,

1604
07:02:40,119 --> 07:02:44,259
he spins it around before he swings it. When he did, when he does that, you're close enough.

1605
07:02:45,060 --> 07:03:26,630
No, I thought he was going to do another move. Dude, like, let me just, let me get a hit it.

1606
07:03:27,349 --> 07:04:53,849
Like, it's not very much open. I even waited to spin. This is new. I don't know what that is.

1607
07:04:55,029 --> 07:05:06,259
Oh, that's new too. Okay. Uh, he forgot he has magic. Uh, casting a spell at this boss is pretty

1608
07:05:06,259 --> 07:05:16,279
much, I'm guaranteed to die. Takes too long. And so this, this guy's magic. He's, he's definitely,

1609
07:05:17,240 --> 07:05:25,740
he's going to be immune to magic. I could do the boys. Let's see.

1610
07:05:26,380 --> 07:06:16,840
Can't put a lock onto him. Nice job, boys. Excellent work. And add a stamina. Or I don't

1611
07:06:16,840 --> 07:06:21,240
know what the fuck happened. I just like got caught up with all the loud sounds and all.

1612
07:06:24,790 --> 07:06:28,790
I don't even know what happened. I just like all the sounds. There's so much fucking sounds.

1613
07:06:28,790 --> 07:06:34,659
I just heard like, I just heard it like screams and slashes and like, I just like,

1614
07:06:34,659 --> 07:06:37,220
I'm just going to be a part of it. I'm going to get up there. I'm going to slash him too.

1615
07:06:40,810 --> 07:07:29,139
Something in my eye. Come on, boys. Get him. I thought I got under the horse. I thought I

1616
07:07:29,139 --> 07:08:14,279
got under the horse, but I didn't. Oh, come on. All right. All right. All right. All right.

1617
07:08:14,279 --> 07:08:32,540
How do I get away from this? Just dodge it. What the fuck? Jump, maybe jump. I don't, I don't know.

1618
07:08:33,419 --> 07:08:39,540
Jump over it. I dodged that pretty, I thought that was pretty good dodge.

1619
07:08:41,450 --> 07:08:48,150
Maybe jump. Dodge forward. Dodge into it. I won't, it won't hit me, right?

1620
07:08:56,659 --> 07:09:02,500
Dodge forward might work, but it's an explosion. Isn't dodging forward the same distance as

1621
07:09:02,500 --> 07:09:12,419
dodging to the right or left? Wrong thing up. This is a wash. Yeah, just kill me.

1622
07:09:17,000 --> 07:09:25,979
I didn't have the boys ready. What about the thop shield? I feel like it's, that's so,

1623
07:09:25,979 --> 07:09:30,310
that's so hard to use because it's like, one, you got to time that perfectly.

1624
07:09:30,950 --> 07:09:44,729
I don't think I need it. I think as long as I could reliably get away from the whatever it is.

1625
07:09:45,450 --> 07:09:49,529
Do I have the thop step? I already found the thop step. It was just the academy step.

1626
07:09:50,409 --> 07:10:09,740
Uh, I forgot again. Yeah, kill me again. I keep forgetting to summon them when I get in.

1627
07:10:10,619 --> 07:10:19,979
I also might have to stop streaming. My eyes, I can like feel my eyes starting to like pulse.

1628
07:10:20,860 --> 07:10:29,849
It's probably time to stop. And I would, I, I thought I was going to be able to go longer

1629
07:10:29,849 --> 07:11:29,659
today. I don't, I don't think so. Did you hit, he didn't even swing at me. Billy, eat shit.

1630
07:11:30,459 --> 07:12:13,590
How many attacks? That's kind of bullshit. All right, here we go.

1631
07:12:14,229 --> 07:13:46,169
Dodge through it. Let's go on a good one. Go on a good one.

1632
07:14:00,419 --> 07:14:15,020
Oh man, that was hard. Magical bow? Yeah, that wasn't too bad. It was just trying to figure out

1633
07:14:15,020 --> 07:14:22,040
how to get away from the projectiles. Cause once, once you understand that, like, it's hard to

1634
07:14:22,040 --> 07:14:26,380
determine if he's going to swing more than two or three times, but just let him do it. Right?

1635
07:14:27,259 --> 07:14:35,479
When he, when, when you're next to him and he's like, swing, swing, don't attack. Like sometimes

1636
07:14:35,479 --> 07:14:39,639
he does it twice. Sometimes he does it three times. Sometimes he does it four times. You just,

1637
07:14:39,639 --> 07:14:48,659
just dodge it, just dodge. And then when he stops, take a swing. That was on 10,000 souls? Really?

1638
07:14:49,849 --> 07:15:15,580
That's it? Only 10k? That's kind of horseshit. Did he have a, let me see those spells.

1639
07:15:19,080 --> 07:15:28,200
Oh, these are crystals. Oh, that's probably so cool though. Let me see.

1640
07:15:39,979 --> 07:15:44,810
Imagine hitting somebody with this. I imagine shooting that. That's no way you're going to hit

1641
07:15:44,810 --> 07:15:53,819
anybody with that. Not a chance. I mean, maybe you'll hit. I mean, that's, that's awesome.

1642
07:15:55,419 --> 07:16:00,790
All right. I gotta call it. I, I, I can't go anymore. I thought I was going to be able to

1643
07:16:00,790 --> 07:16:05,909
go for like at least another hour or two. No, no way. You can probably tell my like energy,

1644
07:16:05,909 --> 07:16:11,849
like an hour ago. I went from like a seven, eight out of 10 energy to like a three or like a four,

1645
07:16:11,849 --> 07:16:18,099
like, like 45 minutes ago. I'll go back through. I'm not, we're not, I'm not going to be streaming

1646
07:16:18,099 --> 07:16:37,020
tomorrow. The next time I will be live. Let's do today. Okay. I will see you guys for more Elden

1647
07:16:37,020 --> 07:16:50,700
Ring on Wednesday. I'll take a couple of days. I'll refresh and we will go Wednesday, probably

1648
07:16:50,700 --> 07:16:56,790
Wednesday, Thursday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday. Cause I'm into it. I don't want to, I don't want

1649
07:16:56,790 --> 07:17:02,540
to take too long of a break. Maybe like a day or two. Cause I really don't want to lose the muscle

1650
07:17:02,540 --> 07:17:08,060
memory. Cause if you don't play for like a week and you come back, you just, you're like a wet

1651
07:17:08,060 --> 07:17:12,810
sock. You're like a, you're like a dirty wet sock and it doesn't work. You'll forget how to play.

1652
07:17:12,810 --> 07:17:21,299
Yeah. It's true. Wednesday at, yeah. Wednesday at four. I'll see you guys on Wednesday. Thanks

1653
07:17:21,299 --> 07:17:24,340
for hanging out. Thanks for watching the streams. I think we're making pretty good progress.

1654
07:17:24,979 --> 07:17:31,259
And I talked a lot of shit about this area, but you know, I literally talk shit about the entire

1655
07:17:31,259 --> 07:17:38,340
game the entire time I'm playing. I'll see you Wednesday. Thanks for watching. We'll hang out

1656
07:17:38,340 --> 07:17:49,819
for a minute. Uh, that's saved there. Best boss in the game is coming up. Ooh, well I'm excited for

1657
07:17:49,819 --> 07:18:00,150
Wednesday. Thanks for staying up too. I know I, I, this launch has been kind of crazy. All these,

1658
07:18:01,560 --> 07:18:05,639
all these streams going into like three o'clock in the morning Eastern, four o'clock in the morning

1659
07:18:05,639 --> 07:18:11,369
Eastern pretty much. That will probably change a little once, uh, you know, maybe there's this

1660
07:18:11,369 --> 07:18:21,459
next week rolls around, but I am fucking tired. It's so funny cause like, okay, after the pot

1661
07:18:21,459 --> 07:18:27,380
almost killed me twice, my soul left my body even more than it already was. I don't, I'm actually,

1662
07:18:27,380 --> 07:18:31,139
I'm not even, I'm surprised I actually could beat this guy. People were asking me like questions

1663
07:18:31,139 --> 07:18:36,259
and I was like, I do what I did. I can't do that. I think I just shut my brain off and fought him.

1664
07:18:40,599 --> 07:18:59,380
Oh, machete immunity building up. Oh, that's just been four days. Empty head implying that you're

1665
07:18:59,380 --> 07:19:05,060
going to beat it. Pepe laughing. I beat Dark Souls three on stream. I beat Sekiro on stream.

1666
07:19:05,060 --> 07:19:16,819
If I can do Sekiro, which I think Sekiro was harder than this game so far, this is much longer than

1667
07:19:16,819 --> 07:19:24,020
Sekiro, but I think the difficulty in playing Sekiro is harder than this. They're harder in

1668
07:19:24,020 --> 07:19:28,979
different ways, but this one, this is like the harder, I don't know where I would put this in

1669
07:19:28,979 --> 07:19:36,169
difficulty. I really don't know. I think Sekiro is, I think is much more difficult because the

1670
07:19:36,169 --> 07:19:40,709
game is played a lot differently and it was a lot, it was really hard to get used to the fact that

1671
07:19:40,709 --> 07:19:47,110
you had to just sit there in L1 of every single enemy in the game. You couldn't like dodge around.

1672
07:19:47,110 --> 07:19:52,389
You couldn't, there was no sorcery. There was no dodge mechanic that was, you know, that's it. You

1673
07:19:52,389 --> 07:19:57,830
died. You could dodge, but it wasn't even close to, you needed to parry. You had to parry almost

1674
07:19:57,830 --> 07:20:06,549
every single attack. Well, I think this is probably the hardest of the Dark Souls-like games.

1675
07:20:08,520 --> 07:20:14,180
That's tough though, because I do remember, I remember a few encounters in Dark Souls three

1676
07:20:14,180 --> 07:20:21,340
being like unbearable. I'm trying to think of like comparing some hard bots. It's been so long since

1677
07:20:21,340 --> 07:20:28,599
I played Dark Souls three. Like Pontiff maybe. I remember struggling with Pontiff and being like,

1678
07:20:28,599 --> 07:20:36,580
holy shit, this guy's like not completable. I haven't really, okay, I haven't really thought

1679
07:20:36,580 --> 07:20:46,169
that way yet about any, Pontiff was easy. Pontiff was easy if you could parry, because you could

1680
07:20:46,169 --> 07:20:53,000
parry him, right? It was the, when he summoned the second clone of himself, it just was so,

1681
07:20:53,000 --> 07:21:01,770
my brain was so hard to dodge and get around the clone. The DLC dragon? Yeah, okay, there it is.

1682
07:21:01,770 --> 07:21:05,529
Yeah, some of the DLC in Dark Souls three was unbelievably difficult. I remember, I actually

1683
07:21:05,529 --> 07:21:15,659
had to summon people for that shit. I remember summoning people for that dragon. Yeah, Midir.

1684
07:21:15,659 --> 07:21:22,819
Midir, it was unbearable. Nameless King was pretty bad too, but I feel like Nameless King was not

1685
07:21:22,819 --> 07:21:28,840
as, just, Midir just had so much health. The fight just dragged on so long that you got kind of like

1686
07:21:28,840 --> 07:21:33,930
exhausted halfway through it. Oh no, I never beat Midir. I remember summoning four people and we

1687
07:21:33,930 --> 07:21:45,720
couldn't do it. All right, I'm taking a break from streaming for a day and a half, two days.

1688
07:21:45,720 --> 07:21:55,080
Thanks again everybody. I'll see you soon. I believe there's a big boss coming up here.

1689
07:21:55,080 --> 07:21:59,619
We'll find out. Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.

1690
07:22:00,340 --> 07:22:04,330
Take care of yourselves. I'm gonna go, I'm gonna go take a shower

1691
07:22:05,130 --> 07:22:12,439
and I'll see you guys Wednesday at four o'clock. Good night. Goodbye. Take care of yourselves.

1692
07:22:12,439 --> 07:22:13,479
Have a great night.
