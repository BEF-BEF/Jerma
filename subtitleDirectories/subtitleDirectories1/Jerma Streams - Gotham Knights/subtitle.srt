1
00:00:01,659 --> 00:00:12,550
Okay, I have returned. I'm ready. I do before this this sponsor segment gets started

2
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:14,949
I do want to put something on real quick because I heard

3
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:20,289
Somebody said to watch this and I don't know what it is

4
00:00:20,289 --> 00:00:26,339
So but I actually have no idea what this is. I was told to watch it. It might be loud

5
00:00:26,339 --> 00:00:30,179
So just turn your volume down a little bit. I'm serious turn your volume down

6
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:36,770
Oh

7
00:00:41,179 --> 00:00:56,700
I'm back. We're about to begin. Make sure my title is correct. And let me maybe tweet. I

8
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:13,769
Have a tweet I'm gonna do and then actually I can probably just do this right here. Gotham Knights

9
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:26,590
Where there you are?

10
00:01:26,629 --> 00:01:49,420
All right, let me tweet. We'll get this started. Oh, I completely forgot that I live tweeted the entire who be Halloween movie

11
00:01:49,939 --> 00:01:55,719
And I was in my drafts. It's like it's like five paragraphs. I forgot about that. We'll talk about that probably tomorrow

12
00:01:56,239 --> 00:01:59,909
All right. Let me tweet this

13
00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:11,400
Okay, let's go. Thank you Warner Brothers for sponsoring this a segment of the stream

14
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:18,789
This is Gotham Knights and I am ready. I think comes out soon

15
00:02:19,469 --> 00:02:31,289
Mara right that accurate. Yeah. Thanks Warner Brothers. Seriously. Hey

16
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:36,050
Warner Brothers has been like an unbelievable supporter of this stream. So

17
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:39,610
Let's give it a try see how it is. I'm gonna play this for the next couple of days

18
00:02:40,409 --> 00:02:41,650
Let's go

19
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:58,120
That's fine. Oh, I think subtitles are on very easy. Very easy. All right, if the game is on very easy

20
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:03,580
Do enemies just kill each other, right?

21
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:13,039
Like what do you just kind of walk around do hard hard hard hard hard, please hard hard hard. All right fine

22
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:34,080
Geez, I don't think it'd be too hard. All right, I'll do it. Yeah, I did these settings already

23
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:37,599
Okay, here we go

24
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:50,889
The fragment video file. So is it the apparently is open world. Let's find out the fragment quiet

25
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:21,500
Shit, no, that's not the right. You're watching this. I'm dead. Fuck. I've actually fucking pissed. Hold on. What the fuck

26
00:04:28,259 --> 00:04:44,649
You're done you and I was that

27
00:04:46,209 --> 00:05:02,339
Your disappointment

28
00:05:03,259 --> 00:05:12,269
Whoa, whoa

29
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:20,339
And you're trying to fight this war and for what

30
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:28,540
Corruption still flourishes in Gotham lurking in every shadow. You don't need that mask. I know it's you

31
00:05:29,379 --> 00:05:35,879
We shall cool your love this blasphemy this sacrilege. Did you think you could keep it from me?

32
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:44,540
Get a Batman smash a microwave on his head

33
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:33,199
What is that

34
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:36,639
I'll deal with you myself

35
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,680
Except us the Gotham nuts wait

36
00:06:40,720 --> 00:07:35,759
What is that t-rex? I just did that. You saw me do that and then the other thing we just played. Oh

37
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:19,839
Wait, he's got powers like that. Oh

38
00:08:31,569 --> 00:08:34,450
Look out Batman watch out

39
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:42,000
I'm the most annoying fucking person in the movie theater. Oh

40
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:46,009
What doc doc?

41
00:08:46,529 --> 00:09:13,279
All right. Well, that was quite the opening

42
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:35,090
What his arm? Oh, I thought that man's arm fell off did it. Oh

43
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,720
You'll be dead before they get here

44
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:26,039
Your precious family. I will slaughter them one

45
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:33,820
By one that thinks he can beat Nightwing in a fight. Are you stupid when they have drawn the last breath?

46
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:39,299
What a stupid asshole. I will burn the city to the ground

47
00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:50,649
You won't get a chance

48
00:10:57,629 --> 00:10:59,990
Gotham is their city now

49
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:41,710
Wait, where the hell are we?

50
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:46,700
Where is this? Oh, they did they just get here?

51
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:53,639
Like a fucking meteor hit there

52
00:11:54,320 --> 00:12:19,590
Incoming transmission. Okay, if you're watching this, I'm dead. This is a code black

53
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:25,210
This message was automatically triggered when I destroyed the cave and everything it contains. Oh

54
00:12:26,659 --> 00:12:28,379
Shit, this is the arm

55
00:12:28,379 --> 00:12:39,409
That's this is like a will know what's coming won't be there Nightwing. I know you always liked the car

56
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:41,129
You're gonna have that

57
00:12:41,129 --> 00:12:46,450
Bad girl. I know you are as a big fan of my computer setup. I'm gonna give that to you

58
00:12:47,330 --> 00:13:12,330
Wait, he's not a prepared for it as best as I can. I know you have to though. He's dead. Sorry. It's come to this

59
00:13:28,039 --> 00:13:30,039
Oh my god, I

60
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:44,149
Wasn't looking at the shadowing both. No, it won't take long for Gotham's criminals to realize the batman who trusted us since Jim died

61
00:13:44,629 --> 00:13:46,629
You get to drive cars in this game

62
00:13:46,750 --> 00:14:01,409
his base of operations

63
00:14:02,169 --> 00:14:07,049
Some of the technology is outdated, but it has the gear you need and all of my files

64
00:14:09,769 --> 00:14:11,769
It's just chaos. Oh

65
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:28,139
Many of you knew Bruce from Gotham's celebrity pages a handsome charming billionaire

66
00:14:29,539 --> 00:14:37,080
And he was that my stocks. Oh, no

67
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:47,019
Batman stocks tanking. He wasn't my nephew. He was a friend a mentor

68
00:14:48,159 --> 00:14:55,490
And a benefactor to those of us gathered here today and to those of you who didn't know him as we did I

69
00:14:55,929 --> 00:14:58,779
Want to tell you this?

70
00:14:58,779 --> 00:15:06,100
Bruce was Gotham. He loved this city more than he loved anything

71
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:16,059
He was a protector to this city. He worked tirelessly behind the scenes to bring justice and

72
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,059
equality

73
00:15:18,059 --> 00:15:23,899
There's nothing he wouldn't do no project. He wouldn't champion

74
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:36,929
If he thought Gotham would benefit and I think in remembering that we remember Bruce as he truly was

75
00:15:37,649 --> 00:15:46,740
He's huge. Yeah

76
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:49,690
I'm getting engrossed in the story

77
00:15:49,929 --> 00:15:54,669
Are they doing the bat symbol with the umbrellas? Is that what that was?

78
00:15:55,190 --> 00:16:20,600
You've always had my back at you and goodbye. Well, I don't want to be right here

79
00:16:21,159 --> 00:16:43,179
All right, let's get to it. Look what I got. Bye. Look what I have on. Hold on. I'm losing my

80
00:16:44,059 --> 00:16:52,720
That's my window closing. Oh, there we go had it off the screen

81
00:16:52,720 --> 00:17:03,129
I was offered what you'd expect in three years to agree to a vacation and Bruce turned up dead

82
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:10,700
He asked for some time. He knows none of us were there. Am I doing that? I feel like I'm doing that

83
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:14,700
What about you you let take a cane give the eulogy?

84
00:17:15,279 --> 00:17:17,279
He offered lights off

85
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:20,339
He thought it'd be easier on us if he was the one to do it

86
00:17:21,059 --> 00:17:23,059
Lights off. All right. He's Bruce's uncle

87
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:30,029
All of a speech let talk about a protector who works behind the scenes

88
00:17:30,789 --> 00:17:34,700
He only knew

89
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:42,859
Which would be there if she suspected I can't see the anti. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. No, I'm playing this night when you get Batman's funeral

90
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:48,880
Here's something else. She doesn't know she has the body of Batman's killer in her morgue

91
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:52,390
Rachel ghouls listed as a John Doe

92
00:17:53,029 --> 00:17:57,140
Slated for cremation and what if the League of Shadows finds him?

93
00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:00,220
All right, we're definitely gonna be diving to your leader in a Lazarus pit

94
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:01,859
He won't be so dead in turn the key

95
00:18:01,859 --> 00:18:06,819
I know I have to fix the camera you want to break into the GCPD headquarters for a what-if beam

96
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:13,230
Let me fix my camera. I think my audio is screwed up

97
00:18:20,779 --> 00:18:33,509
My audio is cutting out. I think maybe my headphones are screwed up. It's hard to tell is my camera messing up

98
00:18:33,549 --> 00:18:43,980
Do you see that something weird is going on with my camera? Yeah, my face is like flashing. What is going on?

99
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:48,039
Why is my computer freaking out? I decrypted the case Batman sent with his message

100
00:18:49,299 --> 00:18:55,740
We should focus on that. I looked it over but I would I'm playing his night wing. It doesn't look complete

101
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:58,740
I think race interrupted him while he was writing

102
00:18:59,779 --> 00:19:04,319
He says this has implications that could shake Gotham to its core

103
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:08,539
deep fried ominous, but not exactly helpful I

104
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:12,319
Saw a few places we should poke around

105
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:16,680
Construction sites a quarry. He also mentioned a dr. Langstrom

106
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:24,480
Anyone know so we split up. He says it won't just at Gotham University. Not sure what is I don't have a spray tan

107
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:29,000
Let's divide up the work. We can meet at the Belfry when we're done

108
00:19:29,839 --> 00:19:31,640
Get it up and running

109
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:42,660
Okay, are we ready to rock and roll here? It's the talk to Langstrom. All right. So now do I do I press a oh?

110
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:50,150
No, okay. All right gifted acrobat rapid combos. I don't I don't need to read anything else

111
00:19:50,670 --> 00:20:22,529
I'm not reading a single other thing Gotham Knights bug. All right, let's go

112
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:36,549
That's so unnecessary

113
00:20:36,589 --> 00:20:40,230
I'm at Gotham you what's the story so far with this professor?

114
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:50,430
Sick all right reach Gotham University plaza is open and ready for anything then

115
00:20:51,309 --> 00:20:55,019
Okay, hold a to wait you can climb

116
00:20:55,660 --> 00:21:14,240
And perch okay, I don't look like a Dorito all right, I look like a fucking Dorito give me a second

117
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:39,180
Let me just change the color there everybody can relax. All right, there we go. So kind of controls like

118
00:21:39,859 --> 00:21:43,950
How does it control it's kind of like?

119
00:21:46,099 --> 00:21:50,299
Think of like a word. It's kind of like um, it's kind of like

120
00:21:51,299 --> 00:21:53,470
my face is

121
00:21:57,410 --> 00:21:59,250
Apparently this gear

122
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:10,940
Like you actually pick up items I think I have to go to my audio settings my audio is kind of going it's cutting

123
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:12,940
Out are you guys hearing the audio cut out?

124
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:19,400
Every so often. It's like if it's like I'm losing it. I wonder why

125
00:22:20,019 --> 00:22:22,140
No, I don't wonder why that's happening to me

126
00:22:22,779 --> 00:22:30,339
Bad news Langstrom is dead any idea where I can find his office a tap LB when you see to grapple

127
00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:35,809
I would not I'd be terrified to do that. That'd be scary

128
00:22:36,009 --> 00:22:38,009
Here we go his office is no

129
00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:44,890
Okay, thank you reach Gotham University Plaza. All right aim so this grapple hook points

130
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:47,660
imagine doing this

131
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:56,019
You viewers are open. That's my way in body cam recording

132
00:22:56,500 --> 00:23:01,490
Do I have like a?

133
00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:11,059
Okay, this is a sprint. All right, what's in here? The cops didn't spend much time here. I'm sure I must have died somewhere else

134
00:23:11,059 --> 00:23:13,599
This is all this office AR

135
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,279
Hold to use AR targeting. Oh

136
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:40,180
Okay, scan the marks on the floor. Okay, I scan. Oh right there Gotham Knights these marks are suspicious

137
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:51,450
All the trail

138
00:23:53,009 --> 00:23:58,890
We are we all here I feel like this might turn into something you'd like it and I lost the trail

139
00:24:01,769 --> 00:24:04,849
Sorry back girl, I don't know where the trail when I accidentally tripped the alarm

140
00:24:06,589 --> 00:24:11,470
That was you. Can you give me some more coordinates lead stay safe?

141
00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:13,750
You too

142
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:24,119
This is a lot of damage

143
00:24:24,519 --> 00:24:25,720
Okay

144
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,890
It's on the ground yet

145
00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:29,769
Investigate it

146
00:24:29,769 --> 00:24:42,480
No, yeah, this is coming out on the 21st. So that's tomorrow, right? You get a decent look here. How do I get up there?

147
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:47,849
Hi, can I jump? Oh, there we go

148
00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:53,900
This is where Langstrom died. You'd think the GCPD would still be all over this lab

149
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,119
There's blood everywhere Langstrom was comes out in 12 hours

150
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:08,130
Yeah, it's on everything. He tried to get away. Yes 5 Xbox both series SNX

Seems to be running at Langstrom spin his final moments rolling toward that cabinet

153
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:20,369
Seems to be running at 60 try to leave the lab. Well, I think I think my camera is having problems

154
00:25:20,369 --> 00:25:39,819
I think it's hold on a second. Why is my camera fucked up? Oh, there we go hidden mechanism crap. It's a hidden door

155
00:25:40,339 --> 00:25:42,960
What were you hiding? Dr. Langstrom?

159
00:26:03,809 --> 00:26:10,299
Langstrom made specific note of these dates and now I will too 20th and 21st of October are circled

160
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:20,210
What are the significance of these dates? Well, I mean that's because when Gotham Knights comes up. What if that was what it was?

161
00:26:21,049 --> 00:26:31,410
Is the camera still fucked up? Oh, I know what that is if this movie means Gotham Knights comes out that day

162
00:26:31,410 --> 00:26:34,650
The release date could be significant. Wait that it is

163
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:42,470
They find what to open the door which input device unlocks the hidden door. The passcode is 0 4 1 1 9 2

164
00:26:42,609 --> 00:26:46,779
The thermostat could definitely double as a keypad the microwave

165
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:55,539
The keypad is modified with computer parts not typically found in this sort of appliance the display has room for three digits

166
00:26:55,700 --> 00:27:04,759
Okay, let's put the password in oh I can solve it right I'm ready nice fail

167
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:19,369
How did I fail? Wait, I failed the tutorial passcode is it? Okay. What about what about this beaker phone number?

168
00:27:19,369 --> 00:27:27,019
It's not a Gotham area code. It'd be something. Oh wait. Okay, so I had it wrong

169
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:35,299
So the password I could figure where the password is October 21 and 22. That's not even what that says October 20th and 21st

170
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:41,240
This is the gray ghost is in theaters

171
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:47,920
How many digits is this 1 2 3 4 5 6 it has to be this right because it's six digits

172
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:55,569
I've never seen a microwave like this before which device unlocks the door. Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait

173
00:27:55,569 --> 00:28:09,650
Ah, I've got it. I've got it Batman solve it that did it. Let's find out what secrets this guy was keeping

174
00:28:09,650 --> 00:28:41,460
Oh, this is something. Oh

175
00:28:42,859 --> 00:28:44,980
Aliens look for evidence. All right

176
00:28:45,539 --> 00:28:59,730
What is this stuff that man's dead professor was researching some real sketchy stuff

177
00:29:00,529 --> 00:29:01,650
Okay

178
00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:07,170
Wait, is that evidence?

179
00:29:07,170 --> 00:29:10,849
Langstrom's desk. Okay, what we got?

180
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:21,470
Organic material collected from various animals samples seem to be primarily sourced from creatures in Langstrom's lab tanks

181
00:29:22,349 --> 00:29:24,529
Okay fatty tissue from a dolphin

182
00:29:29,529 --> 00:29:31,650
Computer. All right, let's get the password. What's this?

183
00:29:32,369 --> 00:29:35,819
That's a hard drive might have some answers

184
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:41,730
All right, I got this drive to the belfry. Hey, I think I'm done here

185
00:29:42,369 --> 00:29:46,849
That was so funny quick missed some weird marks in the walls and a hidden lab

186
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:50,130
With an even more hidden hard drive

187
00:29:50,529 --> 00:29:52,980
Great can't wait to get my hands on it

188
00:29:53,859 --> 00:29:56,430
All right. Oh grapple

189
00:29:56,430 --> 00:30:00,339
How do I do this again?

190
00:30:00,339 --> 00:30:07,309
How do I how do I grapple? There it is. Let's go. I love his weapons. Can I I hope I can fight something right now

191
00:30:15,779 --> 00:30:17,779
Fire alarm. Did someone see me?

192
00:30:18,829 --> 00:30:20,829
How many polygons is on that?

193
00:30:22,509 --> 00:30:32,480
What the why what was the point what's the point what

194
00:30:42,019 --> 00:30:57,940

195
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:00,339
Yeah

196
00:31:00,339 --> 00:31:04,500
It's me

197
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:11,900
All right, his friends are looking out the window right now going like now he's dead

198
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:19,250
Oh shit, it's nightwing

199
00:31:19,730 --> 00:31:23,569
Why would you even fight me run run away why fight me i'm a lesson

200
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:36,450

201
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:42,210
This this might sound crazy, but i'm gonna do this for one second

202
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:56,779
That might sound crazy

203
00:31:58,380 --> 00:31:59,900
Okay

204
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:01,900
half arc of growth

205
00:32:03,339 --> 00:32:12,980
Gotta stop these freaks from burning this place to the ground. Okay

206
00:32:13,779 --> 00:32:15,779
Clear out all the freaks

207
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:22,940
I don't know where are they?

208
00:32:23,339 --> 00:32:42,019
Do I have to press a button?

209
00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:49,789
What did I just do what did I just do

210
00:32:58,180 --> 00:32:59,619
So like

211
00:32:59,619 --> 00:33:05,299
You can tell they're superheroes. Okay, you can tell they're superheroes because they do they do like the most elaborate shit

212
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:07,940
To like knock somebody out

213
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:11,460
Like no, I got an idea. I'm gonna put my arms behind my back and have my baton

214
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:13,460
I'm gonna grab by the neck and spin around

215
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:18,559
You can tell they're superheroes

216
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:20,559
Everything has to be so flashy

217
00:33:21,859 --> 00:33:23,619
Better to stay hidden

218
00:33:23,619 --> 00:33:30,019
The fume's getting to you buddy

219
00:33:30,019 --> 00:33:39,859
On me

220
00:33:39,859 --> 00:33:45,150
Hey there

221
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:49,309

223
00:34:04,259 --> 00:34:06,259
Yeah time to sleep permanently

224
00:34:09,139 --> 00:34:11,139
My camera's fucking broken

225
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:19,340
You look insane

226
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:21,980
Dude, I don't know if my camera is freaking out. It's like glitching

227
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:31,920
Okay, that was interesting. Well, the takedowns are really cool. There's probably more inside

228
00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:42,449
Enjoying the fire range range attack

229
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:45,820
What did I shoot lasers out of my fucking eyes?

230
00:34:46,539 --> 00:34:49,579
I shoot all night when he has lasers and his eyes. I don't know he has it

231
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:05,500
The whole building is burning down

232
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:20,690
That was cool. Like that was really actually pretty cool. Oh shit hostages. I'm coming

233
00:35:21,329 --> 00:35:30,019
Look at this fellow

234
00:35:30,019 --> 00:35:35,579
Where are the hostages?

235
00:35:35,579 --> 00:35:37,579
oops

236
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:46,690
Oh

237
00:35:46,690 --> 00:35:48,690
Dude, the flip star is actually pretty cool

238
00:35:49,739 --> 00:35:55,019
I'm gonna die

239
00:35:55,019 --> 00:35:57,340
They keep hitting me directly in the fucking head

240
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:20,780
Whoa, what is that? She shot him with like a

241
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,840
Oh, no, no nightwing's dead

242
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:39,170
What I have a heel

243
00:36:39,170 --> 00:36:41,489
What happened? Oh my god. I have a new suit on. All right, let's go

244
00:36:42,130 --> 00:36:50,099
There's probably more I think the feed is losing connection. I'm getting an audio drop every like five to ten seconds

245
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:52,900
I think it's I don't know

246
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:54,340
I have to look into that

247
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:59,420
Am I running out of like memory? I don't know

248
00:37:00,219 --> 00:37:01,920
Well, it shouldn't

249
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,159
Maybe i'll turn our setting down

250
00:37:08,219 --> 00:37:10,219
God, all right, that's cool

251
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:16,159
Let me turn a couple things down. I feel like um, it's something is being overloaded here

252
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:24,309
Dynamic resolution. Maybe should I bring this down and be like 80?

253
00:37:24,789 --> 00:37:31,269
Two I wonder what's happening. Yeah, the audio is fine for stream, but for some reason it keeps uh, but

254
00:37:32,389 --> 00:37:51,269
I don't want ray tracing on. All right, let's try this. Let me see if this helps

255
00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:56,690
Yeah, because it's not coming through to you guys, but it's coming through me

256
00:37:57,250 --> 00:38:04,500
Which is weird. So I don't I I don't it's not my webcam

257
00:38:05,059 --> 00:38:10,820
Because i'm hearing the game audio go better make this quick and even one of that when the camera's off

258
00:38:12,179 --> 00:38:17,300
I don't know. You let's see. I'm looking to see how if the camera screws up when it happens. It does not

259
00:38:18,389 --> 00:38:24,469
All right, let's go

260
00:38:27,590 --> 00:38:47,360
All right fire fire fire

261
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:49,920
Oh, I put it that's right. It's unhard. I was wondering

262
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:53,679
I was like my god, these fucking freaks are giving me just so much trouble

263
00:39:01,679 --> 00:39:03,679
Who's yelling? Is that one of them yelling at me?

264
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,280
I'm fighting them right now

265
00:39:23,730 --> 00:39:30,440
All right. I'm here

00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:20,469
X-ray, okay heavy melee attacks and guard break abilities can get through enemy defenses leaving them vulnerable to other attacks. Okay

273
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:30,309
Okay

00:46:41,809 --> 00:46:43,409
I'm a bad guy

326
00:46:43,409 --> 00:46:48,280
They he took it

327
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:51,320
Get me out of here. Oh, did I screw this up so bad?

328
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:54,280
How did I screw this up so bad? Ow

329
00:46:56,239 --> 00:46:58,239
I don't why am I a villain?

330
00:46:58,559 --> 00:47:16,929
It's nightwing get him

331
00:47:18,769 --> 00:47:23,239
Someone set our college on fire. What did I do that? I didn't

332
00:47:23,639 --> 00:47:26,199
I promise I didn't set your college on fire

333
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:33,800
I'm a good guy. I'm one of the bad brick but the bad uh nights the gotham nights

334
00:47:38,530 --> 00:47:40,530
Okay, let's go

335
00:47:43,670 --> 00:47:46,960
That was ridiculous

336
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:49,519
I can't believe that I was getting shot at

337
00:47:50,239 --> 00:47:56,500
Hey nightwing, what took you so long? Well, you mean

338
00:47:57,380 --> 00:48:01,280
Can I actually stop and help?

339
00:48:07,519 --> 00:48:09,519
Can I actually

340
00:48:16,630 --> 00:48:25,969
This is fun. Okay, so just go through here and hopefully you don't get mad

341
00:48:32,400 --> 00:49:08,230
Ripped why I feel

342
00:49:08,869 --> 00:49:15,329
Why did that guy just do that?

343
00:49:17,989 --> 00:49:19,269
a wheelie

344
00:49:19,269 --> 00:49:23,809
I almost hit my head on the ceiling, dude

345
00:49:27,969 --> 00:49:29,969
Now i'm busy doing a wheelie

346
00:49:34,849 --> 00:49:52,800
Come on. I'm going for the record

347
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:55,519
Imagine seeing nightwing drive by

348
00:49:56,769 --> 00:50:01,969
Nick you're on the side street. He's doing a wheelie in the fucking gotham copter or whatever. This thing is

349
00:50:02,849 --> 00:50:15,840
Can I wave or anything? How do I do anything?

350
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:21,519
There has to be a way I can like interact, right?

351
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:23,760
Oh

352
00:50:28,789 --> 00:50:40,719
Hey, how do I do that? How do I do it?

353
00:50:47,489 --> 00:50:50,690
Why the emotes? Okay. This is I this is funny. I love this

354
00:50:51,650 --> 00:50:53,650
Hey nightwing

355
00:50:55,250 --> 00:51:05,460
I'm having fun

356
00:51:05,460 --> 00:51:07,460
Geez. All right. So how do I get in here?

357
00:51:08,159 --> 00:51:10,639
Reach the east plaza. Can I climb this?

358
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:25,920
Do I have a map?

359
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:27,440
Nightwing. Yes

360
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:30,320
I i'm gonna turn it down a little though. I feel like it's very loud

361
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:32,880
Let me know if you need if it sounds better

362
00:51:33,199 --> 00:51:40,820
So you can play as any of the four characters that they get any time

363
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:44,880
I'm just choosing to stay on nightwing. Maybe i'll probably get access to it

364
00:51:45,519 --> 00:51:47,940
You can play as back girl. You can play as red hood

365
00:51:48,820 --> 00:51:50,739
Nightwing obviously and robin

366
00:51:50,739 --> 00:52:15,829
It's sweaty right now

367
00:52:15,829 --> 00:52:32,519
I'm curious about the gear apparently you can collect gear the whole thing is co-op too. So that's pretty cool

368
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:35,000
Nice work grabbing that drive from langstrom's lab

369
00:52:35,719 --> 00:52:39,809
Do we have any idea?

370
00:52:39,889 --> 00:52:41,889
All right, i'm going we gotta watch this pay attention

371
00:52:44,980 --> 00:52:46,739
Yeah, it's online co-op

372
00:52:46,739 --> 00:52:49,059
I think it's like drop in drop out. I think

373
00:52:50,340 --> 00:52:53,539
Once we can get at the data we can figure out what our next move is

374
00:52:57,880 --> 00:53:00,760
I'm going out. I'm not gonna sit and wait for

375
00:53:01,159 --> 00:53:04,630
Whatever this shit is we're waiting for intel jason

376
00:53:05,349 --> 00:53:07,110
Once we have it

377
00:53:07,110 --> 00:53:08,639
Then we'll go

378
00:53:08,719 --> 00:53:15,510
Uh-oh a little bit of a conflict in the team here move i'm gonna solve this case my way

379
00:53:20,230 --> 00:53:23,360
Stop it. He wanted us to work this together

380
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:32,389
Whatever that's making this harder than it has to be kid

381
00:53:36,579 --> 00:53:38,739
I guess since we're waiting anyway

382
00:53:39,460 --> 00:53:42,260
We might as well take another look at what bruce had on mainstream

383
00:53:43,699 --> 00:53:45,699
All right, everybody. Uh-oh been hacked

384
00:53:46,420 --> 00:53:52,099
That must have been the secondary breaker the primary went out months ago. I thought the backup would hold I got it

385
00:53:52,980 --> 00:53:58,230
No need

386
00:53:59,079 --> 00:54:02,679
I've put in a small fix that should hold for a while alfred

387
00:54:05,570 --> 00:54:07,570
Wasn't sure you were coming alfred

388
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:15,489
I'll always be here when you need me master richard when any of you need me. He's so cool

389
00:54:16,289 --> 00:54:21,159
I'm glad you're here as am I master tim

390
00:54:24,659 --> 00:54:26,739
This place does need work

391
00:54:31,159 --> 00:54:35,570
Dammit we've got activity all over the city sweet

392
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:38,690
Looks like my plan wins

393
00:54:40,130 --> 00:54:43,329
He's he's huge we still need the intel

394
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:46,920
And alfred can't exactly set this place up alone

395
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:49,730
Indeed miss gordon

396
00:54:49,730 --> 00:54:51,730
I have a list of supplies we'll need

397
00:54:52,130 --> 00:54:55,570
I could do it on my own, but it would be faster if I had help

398
00:54:56,869 --> 00:54:58,869
You can count on us alfred

399
00:54:59,030 --> 00:55:00,789
We'll divvy it up

400
00:55:00,789 --> 00:55:03,159
Let's finish what bruce started

401
00:55:03,969 --> 00:55:05,969
God give him more lines

402
00:55:06,289 --> 00:55:08,039
Oh

403
00:55:08,039 --> 00:55:15,599
So awesome

404
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:19,440
Open the abilities menu and spend ability points to unlock perfect evade

405
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:33,570
Uh, wait, what how do I do that? How do I do that robin? How do I do it?

406
00:55:34,369 --> 00:55:35,650
Hey tim

407
00:55:35,650 --> 00:55:37,920
How'd it go with the quarry?

408
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:42,400
Not well, I sweep the whole place and didn't find anything. No one's been there in ages

409
00:55:43,199 --> 00:55:46,320
How are we supposed to see the full picture when most of the pieces are missing?

410
00:55:47,650 --> 00:55:49,730
Bruce left us one hell of a last case

411
00:55:50,690 --> 00:55:53,889
I mean what kind of person builds a secret lab

412
00:55:54,610 --> 00:55:56,610
in their lab

413
00:55:56,769 --> 00:55:58,769
Someone who has something to hide obviously

414
00:55:59,650 --> 00:56:02,610
What what was he trying to make and who is he hiding it from?

415
00:56:03,889 --> 00:56:07,969
Yeah, let's not get ahead of ourselves. I'm telling you. Let's wait and see what that hard drive has to tell us

416
00:56:08,050 --> 00:56:10,050
If they sell that robin raincoat

417
00:56:10,210 --> 00:56:13,329
We'll get some answers. Are you shitting me? That would sell a hundred billion things

418
00:56:13,409 --> 00:56:17,650
That would that would sell a hundred billion copies of this like coat that he has on right here

419
00:56:18,610 --> 00:56:26,579
A hundred billion

420
00:56:26,579 --> 00:56:33,409
All right. All right. Wait, okay. This is there's this is a skill tree for each character. I think

421
00:56:33,969 --> 00:56:41,460
Leveling up your character rewards ability points that can be spent to learn new abilities spending ability points also unlocks access to new abilities, right?

422
00:56:42,179 --> 00:56:44,960
So everybody has a skill tree

423
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:47,199
All right, so I have to get this one

424
00:56:47,199 --> 00:56:53,110
Nightwing performs a perfectly timed evade that generates momentum and allows for perfect attack follow-up

425
00:56:54,880 --> 00:57:00,710
Okay, so it's a perfect dodge and then you can attack cool. Holy shit. All right, well we're getting that

426
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:13,039
As you continue your investigation each hero can unlock unique momentum abilities use the momentum abilities menu to view unlock conditions and unlocked abilities

427
00:57:13,519 --> 00:57:20,630
Okay. All right. So I got beat down unlocked

428
00:57:24,449 --> 00:57:26,340
cool

429
00:57:26,340 --> 00:57:28,340
So now we have

430
00:57:29,219 --> 00:57:31,300
Did I I think it wants me to like look around

431
00:57:32,019 --> 00:57:36,949
What's this one? I think i'm gonna go down the acrobat tree

432
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:42,840
Using momentum abilities restores health

433
00:57:43,719 --> 00:57:45,719
Oh, it's damn good

434
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:49,409
You can chain evades

435
00:57:49,409 --> 00:57:51,409
Yeah, i'm definitely doing acrobat

436
00:57:51,889 --> 00:57:55,730
I'm just gonna do that for fun in front of people

437
00:57:55,889 --> 00:58:00,260
Just like citizens. They're gonna be like, holy shit. This guy's sick

438
00:58:00,980 --> 00:58:02,949
All right

439
00:58:02,949 --> 00:58:04,550
more momentum gain

440
00:58:04,550 --> 00:58:07,300
Grants an extra momentum bar

441
00:58:07,539 --> 00:58:16,000
Okay, versus all defense and resistance by 10 working with allies also grants additional bonuses

442
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:20,389
Cool is oh i'm gonna see gear

443
00:58:21,360 --> 00:58:23,039
momentum abilities

444
00:58:23,039 --> 00:58:26,760
You just unlocked your first momentum ability

445
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:33,480
They're unique to each character and require momentum to activate when ready the ability icon in the lower right corner will change

446
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:36,659
Hold right bumper plus the assigned button

447
00:58:38,019 --> 00:58:46,559
Oh, all right. So let's expect superpowers. So it costs one momentum. I got it. Okay

448
00:58:49,300 --> 00:58:52,579
Exit the belfry and patrol gotham city. Let's go

449
00:58:55,079 --> 00:59:00,960
Yeah, i'll play with i'll play with the other characters over the next couple of days and start tonight's patrol

450
00:59:08,050 --> 00:59:10,050
After you grab an enemy what you can grab

451
00:59:15,090 --> 00:59:17,719
Opportunistic crime

452
00:59:17,719 --> 00:59:22,199
Tap down to display nearby opportunistic crimes. They appear as that's in the hud

453
00:59:23,989 --> 00:59:25,269
Oh, I got a map

454
00:59:25,269 --> 00:59:28,599
Okay

455
00:59:28,599 --> 00:59:34,280
Crimes you discover during patrol can be viewed on the map along with any additional activities you have available place of waypoint

456
00:59:34,599 --> 00:59:47,880
Wherever you want to go. Okay. Cool. You just got you just got it. You just got uh, no that game you just got

457
00:59:52,639 --> 00:59:58,679
That'll be that game

458
00:59:58,679 --> 01:00:02,360
All right. So what is what's going on here? What is this? There's just crimes all over the city

459
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:07,190
Well, let's go get one

460
01:00:07,190 --> 01:00:11,969
Ooh, i'm just going i'm going to this one right in front of me

461
01:00:12,610 --> 01:00:26,849
Can you get by a train?

462
01:00:26,849 --> 01:00:29,329
You can't get hit by the train, right? Please tell me you

463
01:00:30,610 --> 01:00:32,610
Did you get can you get hit by the train?

464
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:54,210
Go on drive

465
01:00:54,210 --> 01:00:56,369
All right. I don't think you can I don't I don't know. Maybe you can't

466
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:02,480
Maybe other people get wait, is that the bat signal?

467
01:01:08,050 --> 01:01:10,980
All right. I need to find some crime

468
01:01:10,980 --> 01:01:49,570
There's a crime going on right there. Oh, they're breaking into the bank. You can't see me. You can't see me. I love it

469
01:01:49,650 --> 01:01:51,650
Okay, hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait

470
01:01:58,099 --> 01:02:00,739
Dude nightwing just chokes the shit out of people

471
01:02:10,340 --> 01:02:15,639
That killed him instantly nightwing. Nightwing doesn't care nightwing kills people, right?

472
01:02:19,030 --> 01:02:21,030
What is all this stuff clues?

473
01:02:21,030 --> 01:02:27,360
Defeat criminals to gather clues

474
01:02:29,570 --> 01:02:31,570
What so I just did it

475
01:02:31,570 --> 01:02:47,329
So that's one crime. There's another crime. Wait, why did they just tell me to something was blinking over here. What was that?

476
01:02:47,809 --> 01:02:53,800
Did I miss somebody?

477
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:57,800
Oh, this is right here. Okay. Hold on. I don't want to be here

478
01:02:58,360 --> 01:03:20,360
Oh, they're inside. How do I get in? I'm probably gonna drop down. All right, let me go up. Okay. Here we go

479
01:03:32,369 --> 01:03:33,969
Shit oops

480
01:03:33,969 --> 01:03:43,969
Oh

481
01:03:43,969 --> 01:03:47,730
He's got a gun. He has a gun. You gotta run. He has a gun. He's got a machine gun

482
01:04:10,050 --> 01:04:18,239
I'm back

483
01:04:19,719 --> 01:04:24,800
Don't

484
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:30,659
Nice. All right. That was a good combo

485
01:04:30,659 --> 01:04:32,659
What's my special move?

486
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:40,840
All right, that's cool

487
01:04:49,429 --> 01:04:52,679
Sorry, what are you saying? I'm sorry. What did you say?

488
01:05:01,679 --> 01:05:04,369
You got something belfry

489
01:05:07,809 --> 01:05:15,809
Key that sounds like it's in his body which is at the morgue indeed with knights in gopham as they are

490
01:05:16,050 --> 01:05:18,050
It should be quiet at the station

491
01:05:20,849 --> 01:05:25,489
I guess I did want to see how montoya was handling the new commissioner. I'll let you know what I find

492

493
01:05:40,739 --> 01:05:42,900

494
01:05:44,789 --> 01:06:04,630
Good luck out there

495
01:06:04,630 --> 01:06:10,289
Crime being committed

499
01:07:17,889 --> 01:07:18,690

Okay, reach g c p d rendezvous point should I get on the car in the car?

You can just fly around the city. Oh my goodness. That's so high

502
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:51,760
Is it fall damage?

503
01:07:51,760 --> 01:08:02,519
Let's find out I think I pressed a button can you do anything with the cars?

504
01:08:07,880 --> 01:08:23,430
I don't think so. What is that? All right, let's go

505
01:08:24,390 --> 01:08:33,590

506
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:38,960

508
01:08:51,960 --> 01:08:57,939
For a second. I thought I just grabbed onto a helicopter. Now. Here's the rendezvous point. Let's see

509
01:08:58,500 --> 01:09:01,140
I'm not eat. Stop calling me e3 andy. It's I i'm

510
01:09:02,119 --> 01:09:13,250
All right, that's him

511
01:09:13,729 --> 01:09:20,050
Remain undetected makes sneaking into the station a little easier at least i'm sneaking into the station here. Okay

512
01:09:20,930 --> 01:09:29,829
They don't see that right?

513
01:09:29,829 --> 01:09:31,829
No, they can't see shit. I'm fine

514
01:09:46,260 --> 01:10:05,199
E3 ernie what they call me. All right, is anybody here? There's one person there, but that's fine. Okay remain undetected still

515
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:19,319
Oh shit. Okay

516
01:10:19,319 --> 01:10:32,930
I think i'm making like distraction noise. How am I supposed to get over here?

517
01:10:33,170 --> 01:10:50,600
I want to be honest fucking phone call so bad. He was facetiming somebody

518
01:11:04,130 --> 01:11:07,520
You're a menace

519
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:23,859
Say the current time so this is not pre-recorded. It's 7 41 pm pacific. Sorry dude. Don't forget you promised a bane impression

520
01:11:23,939 --> 01:11:32,840
That's right. Okay, go past the security station. I can't just ask the front desk where they're keeping langstrom's body

521
01:11:33,239 --> 01:11:38,039
Prince put the morgue on the other side of the bullpen for not to be seen on the way

522
01:11:38,760 --> 01:11:52,199
There's got to be a sneakier way in he's open the door

523
01:11:57,909 --> 01:11:59,909
Uh, there is a sneaky way

524
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:04,720
Goddamn freaks. That's my daughter's school

525
01:12:05,970 --> 01:12:18,399
We got a few in lockup one collar and interrogation I think i'm actually doing it

526
01:12:27,640 --> 01:12:30,520
Damn works pretty packed with that scientist now

527
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:33,600
I this I don't fit up here

528
01:12:52,449 --> 01:12:54,449
Find a way to the bullpen

529
01:12:55,350 --> 01:12:57,350
Wait, can that guy see me through the wall?

530
01:13:05,890 --> 01:13:10,529
This is when I grab the microphone here. I lean in and I do this huge burp. It's like a

531
01:13:12,289 --> 01:13:14,289
And then fucking run out of the building

532
01:13:28,239 --> 01:13:30,239
So immature shaking my head

533
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:38,409
All right, so this is a wee okay sneak through the cell block

534
01:13:48,439 --> 01:14:01,970
I don't know why I just like I think it's just one. All right, I can get up there. All right, I swear

535
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:07,760
What is that there's like a case over here, how do I get that

536
01:14:13,439 --> 01:14:17,460
Gordon no batman decommissioned bat signal for a bat signal

537
01:14:18,180 --> 01:14:19,140
Uh

538
01:14:19,140 --> 01:14:24,390
New commissioner catherine cain had the bat signal removed from the roof and submitted into evidence

539
01:14:25,029 --> 01:14:28,979
Okay, how do I get that loot box?

540
01:14:30,149 --> 01:14:33,279
There it is. All right, what's in here?

541
01:14:33,279 --> 01:14:35,279
Various for this chest in here was that ammo?

542
01:14:37,329 --> 01:14:40,310
1098 what are those nerf bullets? What were those? What was that?

543
01:14:58,079 --> 01:15:04,880
Security cameras can alert nearby enemies to your location to be spotted. All right, don't get spotted by the cameras. I got it

544
01:15:06,720 --> 01:15:10,689
Search for a nearby control panel

545
01:15:12,659 --> 01:15:40,390
Deactivate the camera over there. Shit. It's not in here. Don't see me. Don't see me. Don't see me. Don't see me. Don't see me

546
01:15:44,760 --> 01:15:53,720
What what who saw me figures it's locked. Oh shit, I gotta hide

547
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:12,770
Can you see me

548
01:16:12,770 --> 01:16:14,050
Get away from me

549
01:16:14,050 --> 01:16:22,560
Did you shoot the other person?

550
01:16:23,859 --> 01:16:39,279
Watch where you're

551
01:16:39,279 --> 01:16:44,850
Jesus I would not be firing this Jesus man

552
01:16:49,760 --> 01:16:52,000
Don't

553
01:16:56,920 --> 01:17:04,899
Oh my god, if she was standing right. Oh my god

554
01:17:10,109 --> 01:17:35,140
Reckless behavior. Ow. Stop shooting me. Oh stop

555
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:54,159
He's bugging out I love I'm

556
01:17:54,960 --> 01:18:15,000
I'm bugging out right now

557
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:19,140
sick

558
01:18:19,140 --> 01:18:23,619
Turn off your preview and oh, I'm dropping a lot of frames. Oh shit. What happened? What happened?

559
01:18:28,289 --> 01:18:48,100
Why am I why am I dropping so many frames? Oh revenge of the internet. He is bugging out. Yeah, apparently I am

560
01:18:48,340 --> 01:19:01,319
I don't get it. What's going on? No, I was just getting going. I was just getting into this. Come on internet

561
01:19:01,399 --> 01:19:10,310
Don't do this. All right, so I can't open this I need to I need a key card. Where's there a key card over here

562
01:19:10,550 --> 01:19:15,010
Okay, I already I mean who cares about the alarm system. I mean, I've already been seen

563
01:19:18,789 --> 01:19:25,220
Yeah, it'll pass. It'll pass. It'll pass. It'll pass. It always does

564
01:19:30,560 --> 01:20:01,319
Think about okay, it'll pass 240p andy reach the morgue

565
01:20:02,239 --> 01:20:03,760
Did someone knock on the front?

566
01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:08,789
All right. Yeah, this is bad. Give me uh, give me let me let's wait for it to pass

567
01:20:09,109 --> 01:20:23,029
Give me like two minutes. Yeah, let's let it pass. I don't want you to miss anything for some reason

568
01:20:23,109 --> 01:20:26,369
Sometimes I don't know why it does this. I don't get it, but it's all good

569
01:20:27,510 --> 01:20:32,130
Uh, actually while this is let me get looking I want to look at the menu watch your back

570
01:20:34,079 --> 01:20:45,399
We don't need frames for this so you do it. There is gear so you can do different weapons

571
01:20:49,939 --> 01:20:56,310
Wait, I I didn't even know I had these holy shit. I was I was I couldn't even hurt anybody

572
01:20:57,270 --> 01:21:11,170
That's why I couldn't kill anybody there any points. I do not I know I do I got a point

573
01:21:11,170 --> 01:21:19,920
I got a point. Where should I put it while we wait for this like tornado of internet to die down an extra momentum bar

574
01:21:20,239 --> 01:21:29,060
Okay, maybe health right?

575
01:21:29,060 --> 01:21:43,159
I would imagine probably health five percent defense and it goes to twenty percent at full health

576
01:21:43,239 --> 01:21:58,760
Probably that i'll do a little bit defense. Oh, I thought I had one. No, I don't have any you can read emails

577
01:22:02,529 --> 01:22:11,859
Uh, yikes, i've dropped 10 000 frames in the last like 10 minutes. Come on. Come on, man

578
01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:21,640
Really? You're not gonna do it to me right now. Are you hold on a second?

579
01:22:23,279 --> 01:22:54,800
You're not gonna do it to me right now. Are you? Yeah, this is bad. Am I still live? Did I get smashed?

580
01:22:58,630 --> 01:23:14,079
Yeah, I think I just got like smashed out. My internet just got smashed. Okay. I'm still live. All right, cool. Yeah, there's a

581
01:23:14,720 --> 01:23:43,619
Massive problem right now at this time. It is my internet. This is like abysmal. Um

582
01:23:45,399 --> 01:24:07,199
Shit I was chewing your wires this kind of came out of nowhere. I don't have a VPN on right now

583
01:24:09,039 --> 01:24:18,770
Well, hold on did it pass kind of god damn it. I was just starting to have a bunch of fun

584
01:24:19,010 --> 01:24:23,430
I was just getting into it. Come on

585
01:24:23,829 --> 01:24:42,979
All right, go get a snack go get a snack. I'll be right back. See if it will try to get it to pass

586
01:24:43,220 --> 01:30:42,689
Let's try to write it out. I'll be back in like two minutes try to write it out. All right

587
01:30:43,409 --> 01:30:45,779
I am here

588
01:30:46,640 --> 01:30:51,670
This is the worst I think we've ever seen it in the last like few months. It's usually not like this

589
01:30:55,250 --> 01:31:04,609
I played um, I mean like two three days ago played. Uh, we played uh scorn and it was fine for six straight out

590
01:31:04,609 --> 01:31:07,329
No drop frames at all. Same time frame. I don't get it

591
01:31:08,479 --> 01:31:18,760
Um, I hope this fixes still had like another 40 minutes or so that I wanted to play gotham nights playing it tomorrow, too

592
01:31:18,840 --> 01:31:24,850
But I really want to do it tonight. I really want to play I it should

593
01:31:25,409 --> 01:31:26,770
Fix itself

594
01:31:26,770 --> 01:31:28,289
It always does

595
01:31:28,289 --> 01:31:41,489
Whenever this happens at the very least i'm glad I got a little time in it. I'm actually having fun

596
01:31:41,569 --> 01:31:46,739
I'm having a lot of fun with it. So let me play let me play

597
01:31:52,770 --> 01:31:57,920
Yeah, it's still it's still happening whenever this happens for about 30 to 40 minutes

598
01:31:58,850 --> 01:32:03,859
It will be an issue like this and then it just goes right back to normal

599
01:32:04,550 --> 01:32:11,810
For the rest of the night what i'm probably going to do because these are sponsored streams and I obviously want to you know

600
01:32:12,449 --> 01:32:14,789
Do them I don't want to make sure they're good

601
01:32:15,680 --> 01:32:24,869
Uh, i'm probably going to start earlier tomorrow to try to avoid this time frame because it's always at

602
01:32:25,699 --> 01:32:29,939
I mean we haven't had a problem like this in a long time, but when it happens, it's always at this time

603
01:32:31,539 --> 01:32:38,760
So i'm going to pull the stream back tomorrow by a couple of hours to make sure that I avoid this

604
01:32:43,489 --> 01:32:51,170
Uh streams not over. I'm just saying for the you know for tomorrow. Come on

605
01:32:54,159 --> 01:33:11,239
Try resetting your modem. I it's I don't think that's the problem. It really isn't yeah

606
01:33:11,479 --> 01:33:16,130
This is by far. So i've dropped 30 000 frames in the last like four minutes five minutes

607
01:33:17,720 --> 01:33:20,439
That's the most I think it's ever been in like two or three years

608
01:33:21,250 --> 01:33:25,670
So I don't I have no idea I could try to restart

609
01:33:26,770 --> 01:33:30,050
The stream and restart the modem, but I don't I really don't think that's going to do anything

610
01:33:30,130 --> 01:33:33,810
This is a pretty regular occurrence like well not regular but it happens

611
01:33:38,500 --> 01:33:41,699
I feel like it's getting better from what i'm looking at over here

612
01:33:43,039 --> 01:33:51,840
I think it's we may have wrote. I think we wrote through it. I think we're good. This seems like a skill issue

613
01:33:59,140 --> 01:34:12,659
It's still happening, but not as free. It'll it'll pass. Don't worry. Let me tell you a story it once

614
01:34:15,590 --> 01:34:18,899
was a

615
01:34:18,979 --> 01:34:21,119
Man

616
01:34:21,119 --> 01:34:23,829
I don't know man

617
01:34:23,829 --> 01:34:36,020
If anybody from uh wb is watching right now, uh, i'm gonna i'm gonna stream the game for longer not that anybody if anybody is

618
01:34:39,060 --> 01:34:46,210
Thanks dad

619
01:34:46,210 --> 01:34:51,729
I was just getting into it. We were just it was just I was just getting into it with the car and the open world

620
01:34:51,810 --> 01:35:05,329
I was having fun. What's your favorite nightwing comic? Oh god issue number one

621
01:35:06,560 --> 01:35:18,159
How could issue number one not be your favorite god? I love that one. It's

622
01:35:18,720 --> 01:35:20,720
It is 100 getting better

623
01:35:20,720 --> 01:35:26,420
I can tell we've dropped significantly less in the last 10 minutes the last five minutes

624
01:35:28,069 --> 01:35:33,250
I think i'm gonna go for it. I think we're okay. It's gonna still happen a little bit. It'll pass

625
01:35:38,319 --> 01:35:40,050
You tell me what do you think?

626
01:35:40,050 --> 01:35:43,729
It's probably still gonna happen a little bit, but it looks like it's passing

627
01:35:51,539 --> 01:36:04,340
Is it as bad as it was before? I could be so moist because i'm sweating

628
01:36:14,079 --> 01:36:16,079
32,000 frames dropped

629
01:36:21,060 --> 01:36:30,899
Steam is just gonna come out of my ears. You knocked these guys out during brb

630
01:36:30,899 --> 01:36:37,460
No, I did not these guys are already lying down here. All right, I think I think it's passing. It's gonna happen

631
01:36:38,390 --> 01:36:44,229
Um, sorry, but i'm glad it didn't die completely and i'm glad it's probably gonna pass everybody

632
01:36:44,229 --> 01:37:11,569
Just we're gonna pray together. Who's this guys? You it's working. Keep praying. It's working

633
01:37:12,449 --> 01:37:16,600
Who's that?

634
01:37:16,600 --> 01:37:25,279
Belfry tally uncle was here. You know, you can't beat me

635
01:37:30,020 --> 01:37:33,779
My beloved has trained you well pretty sure he told you to stay out of gotham

636
01:37:36,369 --> 01:37:38,369
Dead men's wishes don't concern me

637
01:37:38,930 --> 01:37:40,130
besides

638
01:37:40,130 --> 01:37:42,130
I'm here to clean up my father's mess

639
01:37:42,949 --> 01:37:44,949
Which in this case is the demon himself

640
01:37:45,989 --> 01:37:53,409
Wait, you're gonna what are you doing? Oh, you're just burning up race back if he's ash talia

641
01:37:54,130 --> 01:37:56,130
Even a lazarus pit has some limits

642
01:37:59,250 --> 01:38:01,079
Wait

643
01:38:01,079 --> 01:38:02,840
Why was he after bruce?

644
01:38:02,840 --> 01:38:05,439
Is this a fight?

645
01:38:07,119 --> 01:38:08,640
Oh, it got me

646
01:38:08,640 --> 01:38:10,560
I was just here watching

647
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:19,909
That was funny. It was

648
01:38:20,390 --> 01:38:24,020
Gandalf

649
01:38:24,020 --> 01:38:32,579
I just thought of gandalf again. It was funny, but it lagged

650
01:38:38,960 --> 01:38:41,359
Something tells me race isn't coming back this time

651
01:38:41,920 --> 01:38:49,859
Okay, i'm gonna find the body. What's my favorite soda? Hopefully the emmy found something

652
01:38:50,979 --> 01:38:52,979
You're looking for a biodecryption key

653
01:38:54,920 --> 01:38:56,920
Dude, you know what actually it's kind of good the uh

654
01:38:58,359 --> 01:39:01,159
The the dream world coke. It's actually pretty good. I like it

655
01:39:03,239 --> 01:39:09,239
All right, find the key which device conceals the biodecryption key blood would definitely be handy for

656
01:39:09,859 --> 01:39:11,699
I think so

657
01:39:11,699 --> 01:39:13,890
blood sample

658
01:39:13,890 --> 01:39:20,119
Which device conceals the key the tweezers 100?

659
01:39:20,680 --> 01:39:28,550
It's 100 the tweezers. Oh, never mind. I'm kidding. I won't make a joke about needing a tissue

660
01:39:29,680 --> 01:39:39,359
Is this for playing a game online the mmo key? Wait, do you have an mmo key fob?

661
01:39:41,729 --> 01:39:43,729
You put blood on your mmo

662
01:39:43,970 --> 01:39:45,250
key fob

663
01:39:45,250 --> 01:39:47,250
No, that's not how that's not how it works

664
01:39:51,539 --> 01:39:56,100
Here's he died slowly and painfully if the gcpd has my prints on file

665
01:39:56,260 --> 01:39:57,939
cranial bruising

666
01:39:57,939 --> 01:40:01,380
And swelling multiple stab wounds on his arms and legs some wounds pierced

667
01:40:02,100 --> 01:40:10,579
Through him making it possible to pin his body to the wall. There are also precise knife wounds in the chest and head

668
01:40:11,060 --> 01:40:14,520
Jesus

669
01:40:14,520 --> 01:40:15,479
Okay

670
01:40:15,479 --> 01:40:20,149
the fingerprints

671
01:40:20,149 --> 01:40:22,310
and

672
01:40:22,310 --> 01:40:24,039
the calculator

673
01:40:24,039 --> 01:40:26,319
phone and the fingerprints

674
01:40:26,319 --> 01:40:31,300
Now imagine being allergic to something as delicious as seafood

675
01:40:33,189 --> 01:40:35,189
He had a heart condition. Okay, so

676
01:40:36,050 --> 01:40:40,260
it was

677
01:40:40,260 --> 01:40:41,779
Medical bracelet, okay

678
01:40:41,779 --> 01:40:58,520
He had a heart condition and a seafood allergy. Okay, so it's gonna be like a heart thing soft tissue blood or

679
01:40:59,960 --> 01:41:01,380
urine

680
01:41:01,380 --> 01:41:04,340
All right. He pees onto his authenticator in the blood

681
01:41:10,850 --> 01:41:13,279
Okay fingerprints blood

682
01:41:13,920 --> 01:41:25,060
Urine they didn't perform in a full autopsy. It's amazing. You can read oxygen through a finger

683
01:41:25,859 --> 01:41:35,189
Okay, so this is an oxygen meter health issues, but those recover certain surgeries. Okay, so pulse

684
01:41:36,140 --> 01:41:43,890
Oxybeater links from had some health issues beyond being pinned to a wall and his blood

685
01:41:52,020 --> 01:41:54,020
He pissed on his ds

686
01:41:57,460 --> 01:41:59,460
Okay, it's I think

687
01:41:59,539 --> 01:42:02,340
If i'm thinking here, it's the bone

688
01:42:03,960 --> 01:42:07,920
and the soft tissue sample

689
01:42:11,460 --> 01:42:13,939
It's the sunglasses. It's the okay. What is this?

690
01:42:15,960 --> 01:42:32,159
Multiple stab wounds in his arm leg and abdomen. It's definitely the mmo thing, right? It has to be old coffee

691
01:42:32,239 --> 01:42:34,800
Okay, it's the mmo thing

692
01:42:34,800 --> 01:42:37,840
And urine no the mmo and soft tissue

693
01:42:38,319 --> 01:42:44,149
am I losing experience for getting this wrong so many times it's the mmo key and the

694
01:42:46,199 --> 01:42:51,939
Fingerprints it's the

695
01:42:52,020 --> 01:42:57,359
It's the pulse oximeter and the soft tissue sample. It's it's not

696
01:42:58,369 --> 01:42:59,909
it's the

697
01:42:59,909 --> 01:43:01,590
pulse oximeter

698
01:43:01,590 --> 01:43:04,560
and the urine it's not

699
01:43:05,510 --> 01:43:08,310
it's the blood and the

700
01:43:10,659 --> 01:43:14,930

01:45:53,640 --> 01:46:09,829
All right. I just gotta get out of here. Did you just actually kill me? He's cheering. They're cheering. Are you kidding me?

724
01:46:14,949 --> 01:46:19,909
Yo, whoa, what did you do? It just took away shit. It took away a bunch of diamonds. What was that?

725
01:46:20,869 --> 01:46:27,430

726
01:46:29,909 --> 01:46:32,149
I saw a diamond get deducted. What was that?

727
01:46:54,720 --> 01:46:58,079
All right. What was that?

728
01:46:58,079 --> 01:47:01,060
Was the medical bill?

729
01:47:01,060 --> 01:47:03,060
Dude, that was bullshit. That was actually bullshit

730
01:47:06,520 --> 01:47:13,880
Okay, cool fast travel

731
01:47:14,199 --> 01:47:26,979
I had zero crimes stopped one citizen rescued. What did I do all day?

732
01:47:27,380 --> 01:47:35,380
I haven't been very helpful

733
01:47:35,460 --> 01:47:49,159
How do you get zero financial records research into hearing loss?

734
01:47:50,550 --> 01:47:52,550
human experimentation and trials

735
01:47:53,270 --> 01:47:55,270
That looks like cash payouts and volunteers

736
01:47:56,710 --> 01:48:00,470
I recognize some of these jerks. They're all known gang members

737
01:48:01,840 --> 01:48:04,399
So langston was doing medical experiments on criminals

738
01:48:05,359 --> 01:48:07,600
You're crowding me miss gordon

739
01:48:08,640 --> 01:48:15,090
The hollow imaging system is back online as of this morning. So we're in our regular clothes

740
01:48:15,729 --> 01:48:25,520
I forgot how sweet your setup was babs

741
01:48:26,159 --> 01:48:28,800
It's ancient but it'll do for now

742
01:48:29,359 --> 01:48:35,840
You and master bruce are the only two people in the entire world who would consider the belfry's systems ancient

743
01:48:38,319 --> 01:48:42,399
While researching langstrom. I also called up all we've got on

744
01:48:42,640 --> 01:48:44,159
One

745
01:48:44,159 --> 01:48:47,760
Did somebody ask where batman is our party crusher? Do we tell him talia?

746
01:48:48,819 --> 01:48:53,380
Or do you should you find out on your own? She was a match for master bruce. Do you tell him more ways than one?

747
01:48:53,539 --> 01:49:00,050
The presence in gulfam is concerning. So is the fact that she torched her old man's body

748
01:49:00,689 --> 01:49:02,689
We sure that was racial ghoul

749
01:49:02,930 --> 01:49:05,569
His dna was all over the weapon. She left behind

750
01:49:06,369 --> 01:49:09,649
I wonder why she didn't take a chance and use a laser's pit to revive him

751
01:49:13,409 --> 01:49:18,979
Well, he is massive would just find talia and ask her himself

752
01:49:19,699 --> 01:49:21,699
Wait, you mean to tell me that was robin

753
01:49:22,119 --> 01:49:25,079
Yeah, I can double check talia's kunai

754
01:49:25,960 --> 01:49:27,960
Holy shit, you got huge

755
01:49:28,520 --> 01:49:35,600
You should also hit the streets find out if anyone had any beef with langstrom sweet bust some skulls

756
01:49:42,949 --> 01:49:47,350
He hit the gym. Yeah

757
01:49:47,350 --> 01:49:53,090
I mean seriously, he's an absolutely massive person got new intel for the evidence board

758
01:49:55,300 --> 01:50:01,720
Oh cool. Oh, I got I got a point. I can't get over what talia did to her father's body back there

759
01:50:02,920 --> 01:50:09,000
Good riddance going in a laser's pit once is hell who knows what a thousand evidence boards

760
01:50:10,119 --> 01:50:15,239
Crack information discovered during investigation lead section features the most relevant information about your next steps

761
01:50:16,369 --> 01:50:17,170
Okay

762
01:50:17,170 --> 01:50:25,939
All right. So I got intel ross was in the bat cave with bruce when it collapsed

763
01:50:25,939 --> 01:50:34,310
We might never know why he was there to begin with talia alghul daughter of ross alghul the demon's head

764
01:50:34,470 --> 01:50:39,039
And next in line is the leader of the league of shadows until ross passed her

765
01:50:40,130 --> 01:50:44,500
Oh, I was like what the hell is going on over there in favor of naming bruce as his heir

766
01:50:45,270 --> 01:50:50,630
Last time bruce faced talia. He told her to never return to gotham now that he's gone. She's decided to come back

767
01:50:51,270 --> 01:50:52,850
great

768
01:50:52,850 --> 01:51:07,220
Great learn about your about your next steps a little chat or snitches

769
01:51:07,779 --> 01:51:14,920
All right, the freaks claim robinson park as their territory once in the area use your compass to find the informants

770
01:51:15,939 --> 01:51:20,439
Or interrogate the mob to find out more information. Let's do snitches

771
01:51:22,449 --> 01:51:29,079
All right, let's go for this one. So this is the west end so get to the west end

772
01:51:30,550 --> 01:51:35,250
Okay case file

773
01:51:35,250 --> 01:51:37,250
Basic training. Oh, okay. Cool

774
01:51:39,399 --> 01:51:41,560
All right, let's go do that

775
01:51:41,560 --> 01:51:43,720
Craft a new melee weapon is crafting

776
01:51:44,279 --> 01:51:46,770
complete

777
01:51:46,850 --> 01:52:01,260
Relegation training. Oh, this is all my currencies. Oh, all right. I'm ready acquire blueprints and salvage to craft better suits and weapons

778
01:52:01,260 --> 01:52:03,260
Go to the melee blueprint

779
01:52:04,300 --> 01:52:15,779
I can make a new suit. Okay, a new melee weapon crafting is ready. Um, I already have better ones. Don't I

780
01:52:19,539 --> 01:52:21,300
This is 10 damage

781
01:52:21,300 --> 01:52:36,989
The one I have is better. Isn't it? Yeah, I already own it. Why would I craft it? Can I craft gear?

782
01:52:38,960 --> 01:52:45,899
And not all right, that's cool. So I got to find a blueprint wait, I actually might have to do this for the tutorial

783
01:52:49,340 --> 01:52:52,100
I do

784
01:52:52,100 --> 01:52:53,460
Well, I mean

785
01:52:53,460 --> 01:52:59,760
I'll put them on

786
01:52:59,760 --> 01:53:05,409
These aren't wait. These are level two. Oh, you can dismantle shit. All right dismantle

787
01:53:06,130 --> 01:53:08,989
Yep. Ooh

788
01:53:08,989 --> 01:53:12,220
Yep, that was cool. All right

789
01:53:12,699 --> 01:53:14,239
uh, I

790
01:53:14,239 --> 01:53:18,420
Do I have any points?

791
01:53:18,420 --> 01:53:23,060
That's crafting complete and terror. I gotta do the interrogation training. I'm actually I can't wait to see what this is

792
01:53:28,689 --> 01:53:31,090
Practice combat stealth moment. I don't need to do that

793
01:53:31,710 --> 01:53:41,630
interrogation training

794
01:53:41,630 --> 01:53:50,779
You just dismantled the heroic for an uncommon that I screwed that up

795
01:53:51,340 --> 01:54:15,600
Should I not have done that? It did less damage. Why not break it down?

796
01:54:16,319 --> 01:54:20,479
Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night expecting bruce to call me for help

797
01:54:23,020 --> 01:54:29,630
And then I remember I thought it might have been one of you calling just now

798
01:54:30,670 --> 01:54:35,010
I was worried

799
01:54:35,010 --> 01:54:36,850
old habits, I suppose

800
01:54:36,850 --> 01:54:43,359
That's why I thought going to bloodhaven alone would be easier

801
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:52,960
There wasn't I won't be like him offered

802
01:54:53,760 --> 01:54:56,960
Bruce left some big shoes to fill

803
01:54:59,409 --> 01:55:01,489
But i'm gonna do things my way

804
01:55:01,489 --> 01:55:08,979
And i'll be here to support you gotham is in good hands

805
01:55:09,380 --> 01:55:12,899
So if you do this with a different character, is it a different cutscene?

806
01:55:13,460 --> 01:55:16,020
Or have I not opened that ability to change characters yet?

807
01:55:21,039 --> 01:55:25,680
Gotham said he needs a new guardian complete knighthood challenges to unlock powerful new abilities for each hero

808
01:55:26,399 --> 01:55:30,800
Including their unique heroic travel. Oh wait, you get to actually fly

809
01:55:31,119 --> 01:55:36,350
Like dr. Langstrom was into some pretty wild stuff. I wish he was still alive

810
01:55:37,149 --> 01:55:39,149
I'd ask him what the heck he was thinking

811
01:55:39,710 --> 01:55:44,020
All right, where's the interrogation thing?

812
01:55:44,020 --> 01:55:49,970
Prepare for do I have to do this?

813
01:55:51,010 --> 01:55:56,960
I think I have to do this

814
01:55:56,960 --> 01:56:08,020
Oh, no, I don't where is the interrogation train? I stuck it to commissioner cain back at the police station

815
01:56:08,899 --> 01:56:10,899
Oh, sorry

816
01:56:12,420 --> 01:56:14,819
Ah because she was fiercely loyal to him

817
01:56:15,779 --> 01:56:20,699
No, because you wasn't afraid to call people on their shit including him. Is that

818
01:56:21,420 --> 01:56:24,060
Actually what I have to do the training

819
01:56:31,550 --> 01:56:34,380
This isn't

820
01:56:34,380 --> 01:56:36,699
Physical and mental preparation go hand in hand

821
01:56:37,659 --> 01:56:40,220
Here we can train the mind to prepare the body

822
01:56:41,020 --> 01:56:43,020
But it requires deep focus

823
01:56:43,579 --> 01:56:47,899
Let go of your self-doubt and focus on my voice. What's the hottest pepper you've ever had?

824
01:56:48,699 --> 01:56:50,699
Oh a jalapeno. Oh hot hot

825
01:56:51,840 --> 01:56:57,699
Time your dodge to create an opening for a powerful counter-attack. Okay

826
01:57:02,399 --> 01:57:04,479
I wait I can do that. That's cool

827
01:57:05,119 --> 01:57:12,210
That not perfect that was perfect

828
01:57:35,859 --> 01:57:54,850
Oh cool. How was that not perfect? Nice, but don't get complacent. I leveled up, right?

829
01:57:55,569 --> 01:57:59,699
I'm proud of you dick

830
01:57:59,699 --> 01:58:02,399
Hey, thanks

831
01:58:02,399 --> 01:58:08,399
Cool. I leveled up though, didn't I? All right. So am I missing something or do I interrogation is probably one of those advanced combat moves

832
01:58:09,039 --> 01:58:11,859
I'm going to assume

833
01:58:11,859 --> 01:58:13,960
momentum

834
01:58:13,960 --> 01:58:18,060
Interrogate smoke bombs guard break combo stealth grabbing an L interrogation. Here we go

835
01:58:21,970 --> 01:58:29,229
Hold to scan criminals and locate the informant grab informants to interrogate them interesting

836
01:58:36,899 --> 01:58:46,079
Enemies can be interrogated if they've been grabbed use stealth to approach and grab an enemy. That's not grab

837
01:58:47,140 --> 01:59:04,449
That is how do I interrogate? Give me a hint just what I need to know. Okay, I think I get it

838
01:59:06,449 --> 01:59:30,899
What happened to that person? Okay, i'm gonna grab what do you got answers you need appreciate the tip

839
01:59:31,539 --> 01:59:34,140
Cool

840
01:59:34,140 --> 01:59:36,140
You're ready to move on

841
01:59:37,489 --> 01:59:39,890
I'm proud of you dick. Thanks batman. Appreciate it

842
01:59:52,460 --> 01:59:54,960
Oh, okay. Let's go

843
01:59:54,960 --> 01:59:56,479
I have a patrol

844
01:59:56,479 --> 02:00:01,260
exit the bell ray and patrol gotham city

845
02:00:03,460 --> 02:00:08,899
Check your email

846
02:00:08,899 --> 02:00:14,539
Wait, we're sending emails to each other. We're in the same room. We're dropping frames again

847
02:00:15,180 --> 02:00:17,020
There's honestly nothing I can do about it

848
02:00:17,020 --> 02:00:23,630
I I wish there was a magic wand I could wave but it just isn't and that's just the way that's just the way it is

849
02:00:24,029 --> 02:00:28,829
So that's the way it is. All right. So why is he emailing me?

850
02:00:29,310 --> 02:00:36,159
I have an idea. There's a thing called the gotham historical circuit that takes you to all these cool spots around the city

851
02:00:36,399 --> 02:00:41,090
We should check them out. There's an app for it, but I replaced the data with bruce's files just for us

852
02:00:41,170 --> 02:00:51,810
Okay, so you can got okay. I get it. So these are little side missions. That's that's cute. These are cute missions

853
02:00:52,289 --> 02:00:59,329
You guys remember when bruce hid batarangs all over the city for us to find so we could practice parkour

854
02:00:59,649 --> 02:01:07,890
We never found them all. Okay. All right. All right, that's cool

855
02:01:13,020 --> 02:01:15,359
case file investigation

856
02:01:15,359 --> 02:01:17,789
weird science

857
02:01:17,789 --> 02:01:22,750
Langstrom was murdered no matter what the cops say see if anyone on the street knows what might have happened

858
02:01:23,069 --> 02:01:31,010
All right, let's do it

859
02:01:31,010 --> 02:01:33,010
You emailed to yourself

860
02:01:37,579 --> 02:01:39,579
I did email myself. That was a

861
02:01:42,159 --> 02:01:46,960
Voice sometimes he didn't remember stuff

862
02:01:46,960 --> 02:01:54,300
All right, let's go

863
02:01:54,300 --> 02:01:56,300
I need to do some interrogation

864
02:01:56,380 --> 02:02:07,069
What's going on down here?

865
02:02:07,069 --> 02:02:12,510
All right, I got it. I gotta interrogate somebody who should I interrogate?

866
02:02:13,149 --> 02:02:15,149
Open the activity view

867
02:02:15,149 --> 02:02:27,869
What's up

868
02:02:30,979 --> 02:02:33,220
All right, i'm definitely doing way more damage with these by the way

869
02:03:02,399 --> 02:03:03,949
Close

870
02:03:03,949 --> 02:03:06,109
Dude, gotham city is fucking wretched

871
02:03:09,390 --> 02:03:11,390
I didn't even interrogate anybody. That was my bad

872
02:03:17,600 --> 02:03:24,130
Uh, give me the bike. Is there a horn?

873
02:03:31,579 --> 02:03:33,899
Oh, there's like a bank robbery over here. Do you see that?

874
02:03:34,779 --> 02:03:45,180

875
02:03:45,180 --> 02:03:46,619
Sorry, wrong person

876
02:03:46,619 --> 02:03:51,149
Is it the wrong person?

877
02:03:51,149 --> 02:03:53,149
Somebody was running with like a bag

878
02:03:58,539 --> 02:04:00,539
Oh, okay. There they go. There they go

879
02:04:11,979 --> 02:04:14,779
Robbery in progress. All right, they they're stealing money right now

They didn't get any money

886
02:05:44,289 --> 02:05:46,289
Oh, this is the guy with the money

887
02:05:46,819 --> 02:05:48,819
Give me that money back. How do I pick it up?

888
02:05:51,260 --> 02:05:54,060
One guy got like a duffel bag full of fucking like fives

896
02:06:55,920 --> 02:06:57,920
Am I just a menace to this person?

897

Thanks

898
02:07:20,060 --> 02:07:22,699

Honestly, I would just assume that there was like a comic con going on down the street. Like this is not night wing

909
02:10:24,449 --> 02:10:30,220
This is the guy going to a convention. He didn't let anybody on

Been a few, uh drops here and there but forget about my internet

941
02:14:47,869 --> 02:14:55,800
It's a whole nother story. I need to interrogate someone. Are you humble bragging? No, no, no

942
02:14:55,960 --> 02:15:00,039
I'm just saying that if you look at this and you go, oh wow. Okay. This this is running great

948
02:15:56,970 --> 02:15:58,970
Maybe it was just an accident. Thank you

949
02:16:00,010 --> 02:16:02,439
I took him out

950
02:16:02,680 --> 02:16:04,680
Wait, are you still fighting?

951
02:16:12,859 --> 02:16:17,260
He was about to say don't let him grab you why because i'm going to interrogate you

952
02:16:26,779 --> 02:16:34,969
Don't let him grab you

Yeah, so for tomorrow

You don't have intel. Do you have intel?

Do you know anything?

02:18:29,690 --> 02:18:33,049
Do you know anything? Do you know harvard yet? You know where he is?

970

That was actually really cool

974
02:19:03,159 --> 02:19:11,479
Find somebody that's a higher level

02:19:11,479 --> 02:19:13,479
This one's red. Why is this one red?

I mean I could play crash bandicoot again

1135
02:55:23,559 --> 02:55:26,889
Or do we should we do something else?

1136
02:55:26,889 --> 02:55:28,090
neon white

1137
02:55:28,090 --> 02:55:37,690
We start with neon white tomorrow

1138
02:55:37,690 --> 02:55:39,680
neon white

1139
02:55:39,680 --> 02:55:43,360
Um vampire survivor's got its 1.0 update. There's also rotato

1140
02:55:44,700 --> 02:55:47,979
Which I want to play

1141
02:55:47,979 --> 02:55:49,180
We'll figure it out

1142
02:55:49,180 --> 02:55:52,329
breath of the wild

1143
02:55:52,329 --> 02:55:53,850
I don't know maybe

1144
02:55:53,850 --> 02:55:58,959
Oh, I want to play like a horror game. Maybe we'll play the public combo gaming tomorrow

1145
02:56:01,639 --> 02:56:07,760
Maybe deadly night

1146
02:56:07,760 --> 02:56:10,479
All right. Yeah, put a poll up what's going to be deadly night

1147
02:56:12,319 --> 02:56:14,319
Uh, which is public public combo horror game

1148
02:56:15,370 --> 02:56:16,879
um

1149
02:56:16,879 --> 02:56:18,879
continue crash bandicoot 4

1150
02:56:21,319 --> 02:56:23,790
um

1151
02:56:23,790 --> 02:56:24,829
or

1152
02:56:24,829 --> 02:56:27,260
neon white

1153
02:56:29,049 --> 02:56:30,729
Wait, why am I what?

1154
02:56:30,729 --> 02:56:33,209
They're doing like a news sec. That guy's a shotgun

1155
02:56:35,870 --> 02:56:37,870
Okay, get out get out don't fight here

1156
02:56:40,409 --> 02:56:42,409
But they're just doing like a news interview

1157
02:56:42,889 --> 02:56:44,889
Why did I just come over some fighting people?

1158
02:56:56,219 --> 02:56:57,420
Get out

1159
02:56:57,420 --> 02:56:59,420
Stop just okay. I gotta get out of here

1160
02:57:00,909 --> 02:57:02,909
I have to get the fuck out of here

1161
02:57:08,680 --> 02:57:11,000
I thought those were um the criminals

1162
02:57:11,639 --> 02:57:26,350
Give me the car give me out

1163
02:57:26,350 --> 02:57:28,350
Okay, I need speaking of gangs. Where are they?

1164
02:57:29,450 --> 02:57:47,209
down here

1165
02:57:47,209 --> 02:57:59,739
What's up?

1166
02:58:00,139 --> 02:58:14,479
All right, keep that number four alive

1167
02:58:20,829 --> 02:58:22,270
It wasn't your day

1168
02:58:22,270 --> 02:58:25,639
All right, let's go

1169
02:58:25,639 --> 02:58:26,760
Come here

1170
02:58:26,760 --> 02:58:28,760
Now give me some info

1171
02:58:29,079 --> 02:58:32,909
Finally, I know you had deep langstrom and i'm dead

1172
02:58:46,090 --> 02:58:51,450
Belfry bad news gotham's criminals know as much about langstrom's death as we do we got it

1173
02:58:51,930 --> 02:58:57,049
Well, we know where talia is might as well talk to her in the meantime sunday court and it's now okay

1174
02:58:57,049 --> 02:58:58,729
Okay

1175
02:58:58,729 --> 02:58:59,770
Sick

1176
02:58:59,770 --> 02:59:08,030
Is this a boss fight? Maybe

1177
02:59:08,030 --> 02:59:09,629
This could be a boss fight

1178
02:59:09,629 --> 02:59:19,579
Oh confirm the poll options. It was crash bandicoot 4 continued playthrough

1179
02:59:20,219 --> 02:59:21,659
it was

1180
02:59:21,659 --> 02:59:24,479
neon white and

1181
02:59:27,799 --> 02:59:29,799
vampire survivors slash rotato

1182
02:59:37,920 --> 02:59:39,360
Deadly night

1183
02:59:39,360 --> 02:59:40,809
That's too many

1184
02:59:40,809 --> 02:59:43,500
All right. We're gonna make it easy

1185
02:59:43,500 --> 02:59:50,829
Um, i'm gonna literally make it simple for you. We're playing the puppet combo game tomorrow, but um, no

1186
02:59:51,549 --> 02:59:55,100
Okay, I want to do that at night. I don't want to do that like two o'clock in the afternoon

1187
02:59:55,420 --> 03:00:02,219
I want to I thought I wanted to be like 2 pm in the afternoon. I want to be scary at night

1188
03:00:03,870 --> 03:00:08,329
All right. I've got a plan for you. Here's the plan you are to choose

1189
03:00:08,969 --> 03:00:12,750
Here's what's happening tomorrow tomorrow at 2 pm. We're going to start

1190
03:00:13,850 --> 03:00:17,959
With something then we're going to move to gotham nights and then after gotham nights

1191
03:00:17,959 --> 03:00:23,690
We're going to do the puppet combo game. So i'm going to start with something though

1192
03:00:24,250 --> 03:00:30,520
What can I play for like an hour or two? What can I play for like an hour? I've got it done

1193
03:00:31,159 --> 03:00:34,909
We're going to play listen. I don't even need to pull we're going to play

1194
03:00:35,389 --> 03:00:43,340
The vampire survivors 1.0 update gotham nights and then we're going to end with uh puppet combos

1195
03:00:44,079 --> 03:00:53,840
Deadly night. There you go. I'm doing who needs a pole. We already got it. Uh, i'm gonna fast traveled here

1196
03:01:02,270 --> 03:01:13,120
It's only a third night

1197
03:01:13,120 --> 03:01:23,360
All right, pre-meditated crimes revealed. What does that mean?

1198
03:01:25,290 --> 03:01:27,930
Uh, I want to list I want to talk because I feel like I think this is a boss fight

1199
03:01:30,059 --> 03:01:41,559
I'm going for it

1200
03:01:41,559 --> 03:01:44,360
Gentlemen, this is democracy manifest

1201
03:01:50,569 --> 03:01:57,840
Ooh

1202
03:01:57,840 --> 03:02:08,889
Uh, give me the bike and again this game is available tomorrow

1203
03:02:09,530 --> 03:02:13,950
It's on ps5

1204
03:02:14,110 --> 03:02:16,670
xbox both versions of xbox pc

1205
03:02:22,250 --> 03:02:24,250
Get out of the fucking way

1206
03:02:24,329 --> 03:02:42,590
It's time for our first boss fight. That'd be kind of cool

1207
03:02:48,250 --> 03:02:49,610
first boss fight

1208
03:02:49,610 --> 03:03:09,370
Kind of cool. Yeah, this is on pc. All right. Come on boss fight. You played as the other characters yet

1209
03:03:09,690 --> 03:03:12,969
No, I mean nightwing is my one of my favorite dc characters. So played with him

1210
03:03:13,209 --> 03:03:16,030
We'll play with the other ones tomorrow

1211
03:03:22,680 --> 03:03:28,610
They cast me out hard to believe leadership of the league isn't hereditary

1212
03:03:30,360 --> 03:03:33,719
You're saying you didn't get the job after you asked rach

1213
03:03:35,040 --> 03:03:40,159
My late father insisted bruce would be the next head of the league despite his refusal

1214
03:03:41,040 --> 03:03:47,920
Since that ill-fated welcome nightwing looks like this all the league can agree on it's like the different costume. It's a different suit

1215
03:03:49,149 --> 03:03:51,149
Why would race kill us next in line?

1216
03:03:51,870 --> 03:03:53,870
None of this makes sense

1217
03:03:53,950 --> 03:03:59,229
I agree. It was an irrational win. I warned him the batman would be his downfall

1218
03:04:00,110 --> 03:04:01,069
but

1219
03:04:01,069 --> 03:04:05,790
Repeated exposure to the lazarus pits breaks down a subject's mind

1220
03:04:06,489 --> 03:04:09,329
Eventually their true self is erased

1221
03:04:12,510 --> 03:04:14,520
I know utalia

1222
03:04:14,520 --> 03:04:16,840
Could have used your father as a puppet if you wanted to

1223
03:04:17,719 --> 03:04:20,840
There's something else here consider it a logical choice

1224
03:04:21,559 --> 03:04:24,680
A painless end for him meant closure for the league

1225
03:04:25,479 --> 03:04:28,459
and for me

1226
03:04:28,459 --> 03:04:32,059
Now they want me dead. Why do I like nightwing? I like his weapons

1227
03:04:34,360 --> 03:04:38,200
Leave gotham

1228
03:04:40,159 --> 03:04:42,159
I have other matters to attend to

1229
03:04:43,639 --> 03:04:44,840
lost fight

1230
03:04:44,840 --> 03:04:52,989
The funeral was tasteful. I'm sure bruce would have appreciated it leave him where he is

1231
03:04:54,329 --> 03:04:56,329
You still haven't answered my question

1232
03:04:56,969 --> 03:04:58,969
No, but I can ask you one

1233
03:05:00,620 --> 03:05:06,159
Why would an apprentice to the cowl break into the morgue? No, you weren't following me

1234
03:05:08,680 --> 03:05:11,239
It's an ongoing investigation. I look like a ghoul

1235
03:05:12,040 --> 03:05:18,989
I wish you the best of luck. You'll be needing it soon

1236
03:05:19,870 --> 03:05:22,030
Because once the league regains its footing

1237
03:05:36,360 --> 03:05:40,620
This isn't good belfry talia's got something going on

1238
03:05:41,610 --> 03:05:47,149
Surprising but also not is that why you didn't ask her about langstrom? No boss. That's all right

1239
03:05:47,149 --> 03:05:49,149
I don't want to give her any leads

1240
03:05:52,110 --> 03:05:54,110
All right, you guys ready to call it

1241
03:05:56,639 --> 03:05:59,680
Come back tomorrow afternoon. We'll come earlier. We'll start earlier tomorrow

1242
03:06:03,899 --> 03:06:12,280
I want to start earlier because I want to go a little longer tomorrow. Oh, I didn't even do any crimes

1243
03:06:15,500 --> 03:06:20,120
So harley contacted batman using my homing pigeon in a usb drive

1244
03:06:21,079 --> 03:06:23,290
Sorry about the internet video

1245
03:06:23,290 --> 03:06:26,090
It always sucks. It's always so frustrating, but it's all good

1246
03:06:26,409 --> 03:06:29,850
It seemed like it cleared up after like 20 minutes or so, so i'm happy about that at least

1247
03:06:34,590 --> 03:06:38,600
Do we think it's legit bruce never talked to me about it

1248
03:06:39,319 --> 03:06:44,329
When bruce worked with criminals, he didn't exactly keep us in the loop. I'm curious about red hood

1249
03:06:45,209 --> 03:06:48,969
But it's also not crazy to think that harley made this up and just play it

1250
03:06:50,170 --> 03:06:57,530
And we'll know harley

1251
03:06:57,610 --> 03:07:11,319
It's weird because I heard a room you were dead. Oh boy

1252
03:07:12,600 --> 03:07:17,469
Anyway, got you dead

1253
03:07:19,690 --> 03:07:32,219
Hasn't harley quinn been out of gotham ever since

1254
03:07:32,860 --> 03:07:34,700
You know her

1255
03:07:34,700 --> 03:07:38,879
ex

1256
03:07:38,879 --> 03:07:40,079
Killed me

1257
03:07:40,079 --> 03:07:43,979
Isn't that what you meant wait what?

1258
03:07:44,059 --> 03:07:47,530
Rumor has it she did some government thing

1259
03:07:48,170 --> 03:07:49,450
went straight

1260
03:07:49,450 --> 03:07:50,889
is

1261
03:07:50,889 --> 03:07:53,799
She's got something

1262
03:07:53,799 --> 03:07:56,299
Can we go find harley?

1263
03:07:56,379 --> 03:07:57,340
now

1264
03:07:57,340 --> 03:07:59,340
He's literally alive though. Yeah

1265
03:08:01,479 --> 03:08:03,479
Yeah after I got after he killed me. Yeah

1266
03:08:05,239 --> 03:08:07,239
It's alive, but you know it hurt

1267
03:08:12,040 --> 03:08:15,239
Do you think this harley thing is really worth following up on?

1268
03:08:15,639 --> 03:08:19,850
Maybe out of her fake fan. It's a brilliant mind

1269
03:08:20,489 --> 03:08:21,920
Yeah

1270
03:08:21,920 --> 03:08:24,479
Don't know the red hood origin

1271
03:08:24,479 --> 03:08:25,680
I mean, I think I know

1272
03:08:25,680 --> 03:08:29,020
Yeah, why would she help do I know or us?

1273
03:08:29,579 --> 03:08:45,100
I don't know what it is

1274
03:08:45,100 --> 03:08:48,540
Uh, okay. Oh, that's right. Yeah, I could work

1275
03:08:50,430 --> 03:08:54,909
He went to yours when you could visit his grave

1276
03:08:56,940 --> 03:08:59,500
Who's the original robin who's the it's red hood, right?

1277
03:08:59,500 --> 03:09:05,040
Red hood's the original robin like the first robin you haven't and then nightwing's the second robin and then

1278
03:09:05,680 --> 03:09:12,329
Right

1279
03:09:12,329 --> 03:09:14,329
Dick is the original robin

1280
03:09:15,399 --> 03:09:19,399
Jason oh no, no, Jason. Todd was the second and then who's the robin in this game?

1281
03:09:20,040 --> 03:09:33,370
Dick was first jason second. All right, tim right, right, right. Sometimes that is gonna be I gotta remember

1282
03:09:38,239 --> 03:09:40,239
All right. Very cool. Very cool

1283
03:09:41,069 --> 03:09:42,909
So i'll wrap it up here

1284
03:09:42,909 --> 03:09:44,909
I'll see you guys tomorrow afternoon at two o'clock pacific

1285
03:09:46,010 --> 03:09:48,170
Uh, we'll play more gotham knights again

1286
03:09:48,889 --> 03:09:53,770
Thanks to warner brothers. There's no telling what they'll do games available tomorrow and I think they'll behave

1287
03:09:54,090 --> 03:09:56,090
Obviously sponsored sponsors tomorrow as well

1288
03:09:57,049 --> 03:09:58,170
um

1289
03:09:58,170 --> 03:10:01,239
It's available for everything

1290
03:10:01,399 --> 03:10:03,479
I'm gonna keep i'm obviously gonna keep playing it

1291
03:10:04,959 --> 03:10:06,959
Um sponsored to play it so we'll keep going

1292
03:10:08,379 --> 03:10:12,700
But again, it's not gonna be the whole thing tomorrow. It will be for a couple of hours

1293
03:10:14,120 --> 03:10:19,079
And before that we'll play vampire survivors and after that we'll do puppet combos deadly night

1294
03:10:19,719 --> 03:10:21,719
That's what we will end the stream with tomorrow

1295
03:10:21,799 --> 03:10:24,809
It's probably gonna be a meaty one tomorrow. I would say

1296
03:10:25,370 --> 03:10:29,120
I'm gonna be playing three different games so

1297
03:10:30,639 --> 03:10:32,639
And uh strapping tomorrow

1298
03:10:34,719 --> 03:10:36,459
Yeah

1299
03:10:36,459 --> 03:10:40,239
Uh, that's it. Thanks again warner brothers

1300
03:10:40,959 --> 03:10:51,129
There is a there's a multiplayer too. I gotta investigate some of this shit. Yeah

1301
03:10:51,690 --> 03:10:54,000
See you tomorrow. Good night

1302
03:10:57,450 --> 03:11:03,200
Again, sorry about the internet so hard to not bite my controller when that happens

1303
03:11:03,600 --> 03:11:16,399
Oh, I I had fun. I did that would be lying to you if I said I didn't

1304
03:11:18,399 --> 03:11:22,159
Regardless of you know a sponsorship it was kind of fun to run around hit stuff

1305
03:11:22,479 --> 03:11:27,959
Some of the open world goofiness was I mean it was funny. It was a lot of fun

1306
03:11:28,280 --> 03:11:38,200
It looks like it's something you're into then it is if not, then it's not open world games tend to just

1307
03:11:38,680 --> 03:11:40,520
Bring out some of the best

1308
03:11:40,520 --> 03:11:44,840
In random ai shenanigans. I just one of my favorite things in any video game

1309
03:11:46,190 --> 03:11:52,030
It's just driving around and having people just react just the ai just decides to do stuff. It's my favorite thing

1310
03:12:07,559 --> 03:12:11,549
Yeah, have a good night. See you tomorrow 2 p.m. Pacific

1311
03:12:12,090 --> 03:12:18,959
Vampire survivors for about an hour got nights for about two and a half maybe hours

1312
03:12:19,040 --> 03:12:33,819
Maybe we'll see after that deadly night. We'll see thanks for the subs. Uh, there were a couple raids that came into

1313
03:12:35,200 --> 03:12:44,270
Uh, so thanks for the raids. Thanks for the subs obviously. We'll see you soon 2 p.m. Pacific

1314
03:12:44,829 --> 03:12:53,680
Good night. Goodbye. Have a wonderful rest of your day. Well, it's night for everybody

1315
03:12:53,680 --> 03:13:34,760
So good night
