00:00:01,459 --> 00:00:09,900
Good afternoon. Hello, everybody. It is me, Jettemy. Good to see you again.

2
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:14,759
Whoa, what was that? I went like, whoa. All right, the chair is on a weird spot because of the Wii U.

3
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:25,019
What the fuck? Did I just break it? Did I? What? No, we're good. What the hell?

4
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:32,700
Yeah, sorry I'm a little late. I was ready to go at two, but the lights were flickering.

5
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:37,270
It looked like a power outage was coming. We're getting some high winds.

6
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:46,149
So the lights were going like, and I didn't want to turn the stream on to have the power just turn

7
00:00:46,149 --> 00:00:51,429
off in 20 minutes. So it seems like it's fine. I think it's good. Just wanted to make sure we

8
00:00:51,429 --> 00:00:57,750
weren't going to get interrupted. Now, wouldn't it be funny if I waited, you know, 45 extra minutes

9
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:04,469
to stream and it just does it anyways in like 20 minutes from now? So we'll see. I don't know.

10
00:01:04,469 --> 00:01:10,950
I think we're going to be fine. Well, that will be wicked funny.

11
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:18,890
You're jinxing it. I know this is not like an elaborate routine.

12
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:26,459
I promise this is not an elaborate routine. So today we're going to play Slime Rancher.

13
00:01:27,099 --> 00:01:35,319
It's a game that came out a long time ago, but I didn't care because it was it was not on Steam.

14
00:01:36,859 --> 00:01:48,500
Right. So and now that it is like a year or two ago or something, it was on Steam.

15
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,640
Like I'm talking a long time ago when it first came out, it was on Steam.

16
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:05,530
Yeah, no, it wasn't on Steam like a long time ago when it first came out, literally five years ago.

17
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:14,340
Was it on Steam when it came out? What game am I thinking of? Is there another game that's

18
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:22,819
like this that came out on like the Epic Game Store first? It's like a completely different game.

19
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:34,090
Outer Wilds? Is every like is every game that comes out? Maybe.

20
00:02:34,969 --> 00:02:38,199
But what does that have anything to do with Slime Rancher?

21
00:02:38,919 --> 00:02:43,770
Was it maybe it was a crime rancher?

22
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:53,030
Gooblets? Maybe. I don't know. I must be thinking of a different game.

23
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:55,590
I didn't play this when it came out for some reason. I don't know why.

24
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:58,229
I thought it was because it wasn't on Steam and I was too lazy to get the other platform.

25
00:03:00,099 --> 00:03:11,129
Anywho, Slime Rancher today, I will tell you since our last meeting that I have started the

26
00:03:11,129 --> 00:03:18,810
process of potentially doing a GTA RP. Something and maybe talking to some people, getting that

27
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:27,270
going. But that will probably maybe the next few weeks or something, try to get involved,

28
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:33,030
have some fun, make a couple characters, or just one character that I play for literally two or

29
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:45,979
three days. And then they get run over by a train. I don't know. I'm hoping, the goal is

30
00:03:45,979 --> 00:03:51,240
to have a character that eventually just gets run over by a train. Then I just don't ever play

31
00:03:51,240 --> 00:04:00,280
it again. Oh, Freddy subs. Freddy dread subs. It's the 20 subs. Too many subs. Too many. Thank you

32
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:05,990
though. That's a ton of subs. And thanks. No, I'm not gonna say that because I don't want people

33
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:12,979
to do that. The pre-streamers will know I was about to do like, hey, thanks for the...

34
00:04:13,699 --> 00:04:22,120
But I'm not going to address that. Not enough subs.

35
00:04:28,709 --> 00:04:32,709
But all right, let's play. Let's see how Slime Rancher is. I have no idea.

36
00:04:37,509 --> 00:04:50,699
Create a new game. Okay. We're going to go with a... We're going to go with a Jettami. Adventure

37
00:04:50,699 --> 00:05:00,300
sounds good. Choose a save icon. Does this matter? I feel like I'm in a weird seat right now. I'm

38
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:07,180
leaning forward. Let me get a little closer. Yeah, I feel like I'm hunching forward to read

39
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:19,370
this. Why? It's better, right? Yeah. Choose the Catboy? No. Jerma Sun? Jerma Cinnabon?

40
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:28,410
Jerma Water Droplet? Jerma Sly Cooper? Jerma Golden Pea? Jerma Carrot? I like Jerma...

41
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:44,889
Jerma Isaac Bomb? Which one speaks to me right now?

42
00:05:54,839 --> 00:06:03,620
Water Balloon? This doesn't matter. Who cares? I'm gonna pick this one. I'm gonna pick the most

43
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:18,439
scrumptious cake. I feel like this guy right now. Oh, stop! Somebody help me! Where... I...

44
00:06:18,519 --> 00:06:23,560
The Neelix scrumptious cake clip. I need it. I need to see it. Somebody... Does somebody have it?

45
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:28,819
There's been nowhere like a timestamp of him doing that. I need it. A thousand light years away from

46
00:06:28,819 --> 00:06:34,100
Earth on a planet known as the Far Far Range, Bellatrix Lestrange began her journey. Okay.

47
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:40,220
Whatever that was. You made it up. No, I didn't. I didn't make... I... Somebody... I... There was...

48
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:44,220
That's on the second channel. On the second Jerma channel, somebody found the clip that I was...

49
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:48,060
I've been referencing for years. Somebody found it. One of the editors and put it in the beginning

50
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:55,319
of a video. And Neelix comes over with the cake and he's like, here is a delicious scrumptious

51
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:59,720
cake. It's the one I... It's not a mandala... No, it's not a mandala effect. It's not. It exists.

52
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:14,420
It is real. W A S D is move. Cool. Spacebar jump hold is sprint. Oh, cool. That's a really fast sprint.

53
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:21,939
You shoot these? Your vac pack can vac things up and store them in the vac tank. Your vac pack

54
00:07:21,939 --> 00:07:24,819
can vac things up, store them in the vac tank. Your vac pack can vac things up and store them

55
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:27,699
in the vac tank. Your vac pack can vac things up and store them in the vac tank. Cool.

56
00:07:27,699 --> 00:07:35,509
Look at Kirby. I almost said Kirby the hedgehog. Your vac pack can vac things up and store them

57
00:07:35,509 --> 00:07:42,579
in the vac tank. Slimes are key to your success. Shoot slimes through a coral barrier into the

58
00:07:42,579 --> 00:07:50,500
coral on the ranch. Okay. Select vac tank and then shoot. So you suck them up and you put them in the

59
00:07:50,500 --> 00:08:08,660
little area. You vac'd a slime. Cool. Very cool. Slimes are key. Shoot slimes through a coral

60
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:19,800
barrier into the coral on the ranch. That's what I'm supposed to do. Do I have to hit the star?

61
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:47,559
Did it, right? Looking for a coral reef. Okay. So that you suck up slimes. You can only have one

62
00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:54,649
spot. One slime per spot. Okay. You got it. You got it. You got it. You got it. You got it. You got

63
00:08:54,649 --> 00:09:08,090
it. You got it. Do you got it? Thank God somebody's got it. I need to hear this. Yes. Okay. I need to

64
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:16,039
watch this right now. You guys, everyone thought I was fucking crazy. Everyone thought I was crazy.

65
00:09:16,039 --> 00:09:41,399
I am not crazy. I need to see it. I have to get it on here. Where is it? Where is it?

66
00:09:48,789 --> 00:10:13,320
Where was it? No, that's not. Where was it? We can use a tractor beam. Nobody use that.

67
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:24,200
Nobody use that. You'll be in big trouble. Do I click on it? Let's just watch this.

68
00:10:26,549 --> 00:10:37,720
Or do you cheer? Open the clip again. Which one? I feel like you try because you don't want to boo

69
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:41,000
because they're doing the song there. You're there. You're a big fan of the band.

70
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:46,980
This guy's ruining everything. I feel like it'd be like, I don't know, every like four or five

71
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,539
months. I have to tell you how much Streamlabs OBS sucks. I feel like it'd be like, yeah.

72
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:59,769
Let's do that here. Cake anyone? Yes. I made the most scrumptious cake. Yes.

73
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:21,700
I just had the most scrumptious cake. Yes. That's you. No. Yeah. That was me when he

74
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:26,740
comes in and he goes, cake anyone? I've made a scrumptious cake. That was me doing an impression

75
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:30,419
of him coming in with the cake, but he did that all the time. He did that shit all the fucking time.

76
00:11:36,789 --> 00:11:41,509
You don't understand. Neelix did that shit every other episode. He'd be like, Captain,

77
00:11:42,389 --> 00:11:46,950
you must try this delicious coffee. It's better than coffee and it's scrumptious.

78
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:49,750
He would do it every other episode. I swear to God, every other episode.

79
00:11:50,710 --> 00:12:01,129
Oh, what's this? You acquired a slime plort. When slimes eat, they make plorts. Head over

80
00:12:01,129 --> 00:12:10,539
to the plort market to cash in your plort. What? Plort market. When they eat, they make plorts.

81
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:20,090
I got an email. Plort market gives you new bucks for your hard-earned plorts. Shoot a

82
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:31,190
plort into the plort market and earn some cash. Think plort. 13 plorts. Oh, that's what they have.

83
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:37,539
It's the stock market in this game. This is fucking awesome. All right, cool. I already love it.

84
00:12:38,659 --> 00:12:45,720
Captain. Okay, so I need... What's currently valuable right now? All right, the blue spiky

85
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:53,830
plorts went down. We want the orange plorts. Oh, this is cool. This dude just plorted it out of

86
00:12:53,830 --> 00:13:10,340
his mind. Okay, so catch slimes. Feed slimes. Sell plorts. Got it. Press E to activate.

87
00:13:11,129 --> 00:13:23,370
Empty ranch plot. A garden. A corral. Why can I not say this? Coral. Happy slime makes for a

88
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:27,850
happy rancher. A garden. Nothing beats the taste of food. Oh, this is food. So, should I make this?

89
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:34,440
Make a garden so I can eat? A co-op. Keeping chickens in their place prevents the uprising.

90
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,559
A silo. You can't take it with you when you go, so put it in storage. Incinerator. Don't need to

91
00:13:39,559 --> 00:13:45,340
burn it. All right, cool. I think this game seems like it's gonna be really fun. So, do I just go?

92
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:48,139
Is this... Do I just... Am I... Did I do the tutorial? Do I know what I'm doing?

93
00:13:49,909 --> 00:13:58,820
The grotto. Oh, it's... It's... Otto's grotto. I like grotto. I call Otto grotto all the time.

94
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:03,159
A dark and gloomy cavern above the sea. It costs money to go over there?

95
00:14:03,879 --> 00:14:13,769
Okay, what about this? What's this? Press E. Backpack upgrades. This upgrades in the game.

96
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:24,820
This is gonna be my favorite game ever made. Do you clean shit in this game too? I hope so.

97
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:31,190
All right, yeah. Hearts. Power core. All right, cool. So, should I... I need to go to an area...

98
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:35,830
What's this 52? What's that 52? Why is it 45? What's it doing?

99
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:43,379
Plort market. The plort market is a network of buyers and sellers of plorts across the galaxy.

100
00:14:43,379 --> 00:14:48,629
Yeah, okay. I got it. It fluctuates, of course. You need to clean up your act.

101
00:14:53,259 --> 00:15:00,779
The overgrowth. I need 2,000 to go here. Go over here. What's this thing?

102
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:13,669
Range exchange offline. Stop saying plort. Why? How many slimes can you fit in one

103
00:15:13,669 --> 00:15:19,110
cage? Briar reef. A coral crusted ocean floor that now baths under a golden sun.

104
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:27,210
Wait, I gotta sell this plort. God, this thing fucking broke his neck.

105
00:15:28,009 --> 00:15:36,759
All right, plort. How many stacks of plorts can you have? How many plort boxes can fit?

106
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:44,009
This is my house? Oh, shit. Secret style at Starmill.

107
00:15:45,539 --> 00:15:50,340
I. B. What's it like to sleep for a whole year? Did you dream? I can't imagine what that's like.

108
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:56,340
7ZEE puts you in a pod and then lights up for all that time. Wow. What's the far, far range

109
00:15:56,340 --> 00:16:00,899
like? If you started exploring, is the air as clear as they say? I bet it's really beautiful.

110
00:16:00,899 --> 00:16:03,220
I'm probably asking too many questions. I bet you have a lot of work to do.

111
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:07,700
I still can't believe it's yours now. I guess I better leave you to it and just keep it short.

112
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:11,940
Good luck, B. If anyone can make it out there, it's you. Thank you, Stardew Mom.

113
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:19,779
The 7ZEE Corporation is LeBeau. What if we told you... What if I told you that the 7ZEE

114
00:16:19,779 --> 00:16:25,460
Corporation has developed its secret styles and allows slimes to express themselves and show off

115
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:30,019
their... I bought the DLC, yes. If you answered that question, please know that we cannot hear

116
00:16:30,019 --> 00:16:37,059
you as you are reading Starmill in a visual display unit. He's a cool boss, apparently.

117
00:16:37,059 --> 00:16:42,950
We got a cool boss here. He's really funny. What's happened here? You are excited. Unfortunately,

118
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:45,990
cargo ship containing these secret styles exploded for completely unknown reasons

119
00:16:47,429 --> 00:16:56,309
and left them all over the far, far range. Please stay excited. Welcome to the far range.

120
00:16:56,309 --> 00:17:00,899
Who else will read this shit? We would like... Yeah, someone else will read this.

121
00:17:02,009 --> 00:17:04,730
Exercise caution in your first few days in the range until you get more familiar with

122
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:09,480
your surroundings. Okay. Don't travel at night. Should you require any additional tools for your

123
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:15,099
backpack or items? Make slime ranch experiences. Yeah, yeah, someone else will read this. Sleep

124
00:17:15,099 --> 00:17:23,369
until morning. Okay. What about secret styles? Early cosmetic won't change a slime's diet. Oh,

125
00:17:23,369 --> 00:17:35,099
they have a diet? Holy shit, this is cool. All right, go back to the... Cool. This is... I love

126
00:17:35,099 --> 00:17:45,779
it. All right, I'm ready. What do I do? Devin Chat. What's up, Devin? So we're sure to go...

127
00:17:45,779 --> 00:17:52,700
Is this the only place I can go? Oh my god, there's so many over there. It's a help marker. I know

128
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:58,980
because it says H. Oh, hello, Beatrix. The name's Hobson Twilgers, rancher,

129
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:02,180
explorer, and the former owner of this here ranch you now call your own. Please

130
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:09,529
to make your acquaintance. I was a rancher here for years that I can... Hey, hey, Peter. Sorry.

131
00:18:09,529 --> 00:18:13,049
I felt there was one last adventure left for me, so I've set off to find just that. Before I go,

132
00:18:13,049 --> 00:18:17,769
I'm taking one last tour around this here land I love to keep your peepers peeled for notes like

133
00:18:17,769 --> 00:18:22,970
these. You want to hear what an old cute has to say every now and again. Be talking to you.

134
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:29,140
H. You are now understanding the reason why Dark Souls did not let people type their own messages.

135
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:44,470
These would be everywhere. And like the ASCII art of like Mario shitting. How many can I have in

136
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:55,720
one stack? More than one? Oh my god, this dude suck them all up. Food. This guy got fruits.

137
00:18:56,359 --> 00:19:00,279
Foods like fruits, veggies, or chickens are used to feed slimes. Try shooting food at a pink slime.

138
00:19:00,279 --> 00:19:09,099
They'll eat anything. No, not yet. I need to collect as many as I can. They can't breathe. Yes,

139
00:19:09,099 --> 00:19:16,859
they can. There's a breathing mechanism in here. Am I going to hold the butt up to 20? What's that?

140
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:24,859
What about these? Oh my god. Apogryph. The most common fruit found in the range. In some states,

141
00:19:24,859 --> 00:19:30,059
the most delicious. It's like... Okay. Oh my god. Oh my god. This is Luigi's Mansion,

142
00:19:30,059 --> 00:19:32,700
but the whole point is to suck everything up and not like actually play the game.

143
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:37,769
Oh my god. That's everything I wanted. I can't play Luigi's Mansion because I suck everything

144
00:19:37,769 --> 00:19:46,579
up in the whole room. I tried to play Luigi's Mansion 3. I couldn't. It took me three hours

145
00:19:46,579 --> 00:19:50,819
because of the first two parts of the mansion because I kept sucking everything.

146
00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:08,980
Yes. Oh my god. I love it. How many can you hold? Oh, wait. I don't have enough room.

147
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:13,940
Can I fit you in a different slot? No, I can't fit you in a different slot. Eat this carrot.

148
00:20:17,019 --> 00:20:25,509
It gave me a flirt. Okay. How many times can it eat? You've learned the fundamentals. Now

149
00:20:25,509 --> 00:20:28,069
it's time to get out there and explore. Remember, the best way to become a pro

150
00:20:28,069 --> 00:20:34,250
rancher is to experiment. What is that? Wait. That's a bird. This is like a bird.

151
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:38,009
How do I pick up the bird? I want the bird. I want this bird. Can I feed the bird a carrot?

152
00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:42,440
Oops. Oops. Sorry.

153
00:20:49,859 --> 00:20:54,980
Just give me more things. I want some max stacks. All right. You guys hungry?

154
00:20:55,220 --> 00:21:06,779
All right. What about the Pog fruit? Do you like those? You don't like Pog fruit?

155
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:14,339
This is kind of loud. Let me turn this down. It's like very loud, isn't it?

156
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:28,549
Okay. There we go. Was it fine? I don't want to be too loud. That seems like a good level

157
00:21:28,549 --> 00:21:36,680
right there. Okay. Can I tell if they've eaten? All right. Pink slimes don't like Pog fruits.

158
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:55,400
They like carrots, though. I want plorts. This is so cool. Cool. All right. I think I want to get...

159
00:21:55,400 --> 00:22:10,519
Can I just max out the plorts? I want to eat up. He's ignoring us. Turn it up. Turn up the

160
00:22:10,519 --> 00:22:24,579
volume. No, it's a good place. Turn it up. It's in a good place. It's in a good spot.

161
00:22:24,579 --> 00:22:42,970
That's in a good place. What happens at night? Who else hasn't eaten? All right. I think I have to

162
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:51,960
leave. 120 hertz, Andy. All right. I am going to tell you something that I'm going to make a

163
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:57,509
lot of people probably really angry when I say this, but it's what I believe. I know that like

164
00:22:57,509 --> 00:23:02,150
a hundred years from now, someone's going to look back at a clip of me saying this and they're going

165
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:06,549
to say, wow, what an idiot. I can't believe you thought that like the human eye can only see 24

166
00:23:06,549 --> 00:23:16,230
FPS, right? I really believe that after you cross like 144 hertz, you can't tell the difference

167
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:33,559
anymore. Like 240 hertz is... I can't even see the difference. I can't see it. With 60 frames a

168
00:23:33,559 --> 00:23:43,720
second, which is how most things are built to run, the brain can't process like 500 hertz and like

169
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:56,140
300 frames a second. Wait, should I put these in the same cage? How many can fit in here?

170
00:23:56,700 --> 00:24:11,910
Should I be doing this? Oh, whoa. Give me that money.

171
00:24:17,509 --> 00:24:29,930
20 pink plorts. What happened? Oh, I thought they died. I thought I killed them. Anybody else not

172
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:46,059
eating? Keep eating and keep giving me money. Okay. I got to sell this stuff. This game is awesome.

173
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:54,710
This is the... I can't believe it took me like four years to play this. It felt so good.

174
00:24:55,670 --> 00:25:09,269
More. I need more money. More money. So you just suck them up? Is there a way like I can only suck

175
00:25:09,269 --> 00:25:18,980
up the money? Is it like a money gun that I get eventually? That's an upgrade. Oh, okay.

176
00:25:19,539 --> 00:25:29,700
Just stand far enough away. Oh, that makes sense. I'm sorry. I like love that. I love standing really

177
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:41,609
far away from shit and getting like a slam dunk. I have 692 bucks. Let me go to the market. Should

178
00:25:41,609 --> 00:25:47,109
I upgrade something? Water tank. Adds a specialized vac tank that allows you to store fresh water.

179
00:25:47,109 --> 00:25:55,960
Cool. Keep your head in the clouds with this amazing personal jet pack. Cool. Get 150 health.

180
00:25:55,960 --> 00:26:11,339
Cool. Energy boost. Upgrade coral. Whoa. High walls. Even the bounciest slimes have difficulty

181
00:26:11,339 --> 00:26:19,160
escaping. Music box plays a soothing tune that gently reduces slime agitation. A plort collector.

182
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:23,319
A plort collector will vacuum up two types of plorts in a coral at regular intervals,

183
00:26:23,319 --> 00:26:27,400
depositing them into a storage tank so as long as space is available. Okay, that sounds pretty good.

184
00:26:28,839 --> 00:26:37,289
An auto feeder. Whoa. High walls? How about high walls? They can't get up. Or a music box?

185
00:26:37,849 --> 00:26:42,809
Let's do the walls first. I'll do plort. No, I'm doing plort collectors first.

186
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:58,009
That's probably stupid. Oh, wait. Did that? Somebody has one? Oh, and then it comes out here?

187
00:26:58,009 --> 00:27:04,339
What about this chicken? A hearty chicken bred to be twice as tasty as its cousin. Do we eat this?

188
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:21,210
What happens if I do this? Oh, shit. You ate him. Oh, okay. All right. I'm gonna go to bed.

189
00:27:21,769 --> 00:27:26,089
This game is so cool. I like this. This is really cool. I didn't know this is what this game was.

190
00:27:31,319 --> 00:27:41,940
I did not know this is what the game was. I don't know why, but I thought this game was Pokemon.

191
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:46,420
Like it was here. It's a Pokemon game. You catch slimes and you battle them.

192
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:52,759
No, you didn't. Nobody told me this was like a stock market income simulator where you just

193
00:27:52,759 --> 00:28:12,259
collect stuff. You didn't say the word stock market. Somebody escaped? All right. I just

194
00:28:12,259 --> 00:28:23,210
gave that guy like negative 20 Gs. He ain't going. He's not going to leave again. Oh,

195
00:28:23,210 --> 00:28:38,490
how come my automatic thing didn't work? I need higher walls. Yes. How do I collect it?

196
00:28:39,130 --> 00:28:47,079
How do I take it out of here? They're starving. Get back in there. Get back in there. I'll be back

197
00:28:47,079 --> 00:28:52,680
with food. Get out of here. Stop climbing over each other. This ain't bubble bobble. Cut it out.

198
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:57,720
They're starving. I will get them food. All right. I'm getting the food. I'll be back.

199
00:28:58,519 --> 00:29:11,029
I need carrots. Do the carrots, the stuff regrow? I'll let you get over here.

200
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:31,859
Eat everything. Eat everything. Eat everything. Okay. I need carrots. Can I make carrots? Can

201
00:29:31,859 --> 00:29:35,859
I grow carrots? Where do I get carrots? Holy shit. That's a huge guy over there. All right. Hold on.

202
00:29:37,589 --> 00:29:44,099
I need food. What the fuck are these things? All right. Hold on. Oh my God. There's so many

203
00:29:44,099 --> 00:29:57,369
different types. I need that. What? Holy shit. Large Joe slimes are large slime hybrids form when

204
00:29:57,369 --> 00:30:02,170
they slime eats a port unlike its own. Act to keep them on your nozzle to shoot them to send

205
00:30:02,170 --> 00:30:15,509
them flying. Okay. Hold on. Just give me these. Can I plant this somewhere? Like animal crossing?

206
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:31,779
I need money, man. Bad. Wait. Can I plant it like in the ground? Shit. Come here. Hey,

207
00:30:31,779 --> 00:30:46,119
somebody punched me. What was that? Come with me. I'm putting you in that cage. He's so cute.

208
00:30:49,349 --> 00:30:59,740
Cutest face ever. Doesn't seem to be concerned about this at all. I need another one. All right.

209
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:19,259
All right. What if I put you in here? Where? All right. Can I feed them? Here. Do I get more money?

210
00:31:22,519 --> 00:31:29,160
Holy shit. You dropped another gem. A tabby port. Eat again. All right. No, you can get out of here.

211
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:43,019
Get out of here. Chicken. He's so hungry. Well, eat him if you're so hungry. No, shit. Hold on.

212
00:31:43,019 --> 00:31:59,240
I need those. Look, I got food right here. How much money do I have? Garden. Taste of your own

213
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:10,119
grown food. All right. All right. Let's go. I'm going to deposit this shit. Okay. I'd like more

214
00:32:10,119 --> 00:32:18,940
money. How do I take the money out? There's eight in there. How do I get them? Suck it out. How do

215
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:35,319
I get it? Oh, you suck it. Okay. All right. Be right back. I don't know why I feel like playing

216
00:32:35,319 --> 00:32:40,920
Overwatch when that happens. This reminds me of an Overwatch gun. It shoots out single crystals.

217
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:50,279
And if you hold the button down, the last five pellets will do 10% more damage. Did I sell the

218
00:32:50,279 --> 00:33:00,069
tabby port? Wait. Yeah, I'm looking at it too. People still play Overwatch. Okay. I'm going to

219
00:33:00,069 --> 00:33:13,019
feed the tabby port to somebody. I got 372. All right. Come here. You want this? Try this.

220
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:27,900
Oh, I just made another cat. Wait. Now you eat one of these and then shit out some more stuff.

221
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:42,599
Yes. Get out of the way. This is everywhere. I have too many cats in my house. I probably

222
00:33:42,599 --> 00:34:05,700
shouldn't have had this many. All right. Garden. Pog fruit. It's now growing pog fruit. Cool. Whoa.

223
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:16,460
Is it ready? Yeah. Can I only have one at a time? Oh, don't eat that. Get away from that.

224
00:34:18,119 --> 00:34:26,780
I need higher walls. I think I need more than one garden. There's just money everywhere.

225
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:38,230
I don't even know, man. Like, what the hell? I need more plots. Remember, I want to gamble on

226
00:34:38,230 --> 00:35:03,989
something. Well, just hold on. I sell it. How much does the tabby port go for? I don't know

227
00:35:03,989 --> 00:35:18,599
the market. Is that a tabby port right there? 24. That's expensive. It looks gray on the bottom

228
00:35:18,599 --> 00:35:25,579
right part of the screen. All right, cool. Everyone's having a good time. How long does

229
00:35:25,579 --> 00:35:33,880
it take to grow? Nutrient soil. Oh, yeah. I'm definitely going to do this. Makes crops always

230
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:40,340
yield the maximum harvest. Crops are always water, making them grow twice as I want that one. I need

231
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:52,139
500 bucks. Get the walls. I'm trying to push out my walls. 350. All right. What's all over this?

232
00:35:52,699 --> 00:36:01,130
Did you slime this thing? Get away from that. Get the walls. All right. I'll get the walls.

233
00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:13,300
I need more pog fruit. Hey, I'll just watch them eat that. All right. I got to feed them. I need

234
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:26,409
what? Can I get it from here? If I get it from here, it's a billion off the debt. Oh, here we go.

235
00:36:30,019 --> 00:36:34,340
There's carrot. I want to plant carrots too. So they do regrow. Cool. All right. That's cool. Good

236
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:42,760
to know. No, don't add it, Bill. That's not what I said. Did I get the turkey? All right. I'm going

237
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:48,840
to take a roostro. Trust the stuff like he's the king of the coup. Hen hen and a roostro.

238
00:36:49,639 --> 00:37:01,699
Just looking for some more food and stuff. Just initially. I want that soil. I'm going to feed a

239
00:37:01,699 --> 00:37:05,860
chicken to somebody. That sounds like a good idea. All right. If I feed a chicken to you with

240
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:19,659
a spiky hair, I got holy shit. I got a rock floor. All right. Feed a roostro to somebody. Okay. Give

241
00:37:19,659 --> 00:37:28,019
me that rock floor and get out of the way. Wait, get out of the way. Out, out, out, out. Stop,

242
00:37:28,019 --> 00:37:35,340
stop, stop. I'm just trying to help. All right. I got a rock floor. Just make their favorite food

243
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:45,030
for better efficiency. They like everything. Get the fuck out of here. Here. Eat a carrot.

244
00:37:45,750 --> 00:38:02,409
Give me that. Stop. Eat that carrot. No, I want one carrot. I want at least one carrot. Okay. I got

245
00:38:02,409 --> 00:38:12,840
it. Because I want to grow it. What is this? Map of the far, far range. This place is huge.

246
00:38:13,559 --> 00:38:27,239
This is actually gigantic. Discover data nodes across the range to uncover more of your map.

247
00:38:27,239 --> 00:38:37,019
Oh, that's cool. Nice. All right. I'm going to head back. I think I have enough to

248
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:54,260
at least eat them. Good. Now shit out. Good. Okay. All right. I'm going back. Wait, what's in here?

249
00:38:54,820 --> 00:39:02,360
This entire cave system was sealed off from a cave-in when I first discovered it. Maybe that's why

250
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:08,659
the fellows up ahead are so grumpy. I haven't had a bite in a long time. In any case, don't let that

251
00:39:08,659 --> 00:39:20,420
long-awaited bite come from your own rump. Bring some food to calm them down. You killed that guy?

252
00:39:21,139 --> 00:39:29,239
Okay, so something is coming to kill me. It rolls into a Sonic the Hedgehog ball, looks at me directly

253
00:39:29,239 --> 00:39:35,639
in the eyes, gets mad eyes, and rolls into me, stabbing me through the chest as hard as it can.

254
00:39:35,639 --> 00:39:41,719
And I'm bleeding. Blood's everywhere. I have an opportunity to push, to throw them into the water.

255
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:47,320
I have to save myself.

256
00:39:56,570 --> 00:40:01,769
He wasn't running away. No, he looked me in the eye. He turned into Sonic the Hedgehog ball,

257
00:40:01,769 --> 00:40:15,769
and he stabbed me as hard as he could through the heart. All right, everybody. I'm here with delicious

258
00:40:15,769 --> 00:40:31,130
foods like paw fruit. Let's get some higher walls. That sucked up. Very good. How much are the high

259
00:40:31,130 --> 00:40:40,380
walls? 350. How's this doing? Growing right now? We need that. It has to go faster. That's too slow.

260
00:40:41,019 --> 00:40:48,440
How much do the blue plorts go for? 21. All right.

261
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:57,099
All right, I'm going to save a rock plort because I'm going to feed a rock plort to somebody.

262
00:40:57,659 --> 00:41:16,619
Whoever gets this just has to have a pool. Oh shit, he's dead. Oh my god. That was horrible.

263
00:41:17,579 --> 00:41:27,190
Oh, he doesn't. OK, you can't kill the other ones, right? If he rolls up into a Sonic the Hedgehog ball,

264
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:40,090
is he going to just wipe out this whole colony? Why are they coming after me? He can't be in there.

265
00:41:40,090 --> 00:41:45,579
I think he's killing things. He's killing things. All right, I need high walls. Wait, get out of the

266
00:41:45,579 --> 00:42:00,659
way. Over here. Music box? OK, this is high walls. They can no longer jump out. Now you're stuck in

267
00:42:00,659 --> 00:42:24,889
here. Everybody get back in. Come on. Get in there. One, two, three, four, five, six. OK.

268
00:42:25,769 --> 00:42:37,210
Should I feed them? I'm just going to be a feeding frenzy. I need the plorts.

269
00:42:42,070 --> 00:42:43,750
Well, this is automatically going to grow, right?

270
00:42:46,389 --> 00:42:48,469
All right, well, hell yeah. Here we go. We're going to get a ton of food.

271
00:42:48,469 --> 00:43:11,909
Are they getting bigger? I think they're growing in size. 20, 26, 27, 28, 29. Give me that.

272
00:43:15,829 --> 00:43:20,179
Oh, shit. There's a maximum I can have. Get back in there.

273
00:43:23,719 --> 00:43:26,119
No, no, no, no, no, no. This is so much money on the ground. I'll be back.

274
00:43:43,130 --> 00:43:53,719
Cool. All right. Good. Anybody else take a shit? What do I need to upgrade this?

275
00:43:55,219 --> 00:44:04,059
I want the spring gunny 500. Shit, this is a good price. It's going down.

276
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:17,539
Port letter. Headler. What? Load. All right. I got I got I'm going to keep one carrot flooding

277
00:44:17,539 --> 00:44:33,059
the market. Is that what's going on? I was supposed to hold on to a carrot, wasn't I? Fuck. How do you

278
00:44:33,059 --> 00:44:52,809
get out? OK, pull that out. So am I actually flooding the market with pink plorts? I need

279
00:44:52,809 --> 00:45:00,710
another one. I need I need another I need another corral, another corral or another feeding station

280
00:45:06,889 --> 00:45:11,420
because they're getting cramped in there. They're getting cramped up in here. All right.

281
00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:20,630
Give me the give me the pets. All. No, shit. No, they'll give me the little ones.

282
00:45:20,630 --> 00:45:24,599
Big ones have to stay in here here. All right. I'm talking about little guys.

283
00:45:24,599 --> 00:45:59,269
Watch out. No, I just want the little ones. Quit crashing into me. Get out of the way.

284
00:46:00,550 --> 00:46:15,219
OK, watch out. All right. Good. Now, I need to be able to keep track of who's even in here.

285
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:34,460
Feed them. I will. Where's he going? You keep getting out. So they're going,

286
00:46:34,860 --> 00:46:56,119
I got out. You had to stay in. OK, let's feed. Damn it. Come here. OK, we have they've been

287
00:46:56,119 --> 00:47:04,550
separated. Little pink slimes are in this one. Big ones are in here. Now I need to feed them.

288
00:47:05,190 --> 00:47:12,869
Let's feed them. I don't know. What do I feed them? Make the big one out.

289
00:47:15,110 --> 00:47:30,329
That's worth a shitload of money. I have to sleep when the range exchange.

290
00:47:31,909 --> 00:47:44,070
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Sleep after the ranch. So I need food. Bad.

291
00:47:45,269 --> 00:47:52,059
I need a second food growing station. That's going to be different. Another garden.

292
00:47:53,019 --> 00:48:05,289
Maybe you keep chickens silo. I only have four plots. Help me out here and I'll make sure you

293
00:48:05,289 --> 00:48:13,989
get what's owed. Holy shit. You're going to be seven hundred and fifty dollars. All right. You

294
00:48:14,070 --> 00:48:21,269
want four flying buzzies, five strawberry delicious strawberry cakes and one loaded hamster.

295
00:48:22,519 --> 00:48:33,190
Got it. I have 30 minutes to do this. Where do I get strawberry cake? Oh, my God. I have to.

296
00:48:33,190 --> 00:48:40,820
Where do I get this stuff? Strawberry cake, four flying guys, five strawberry cakes and one hamster.

297
00:48:40,820 --> 00:48:45,300
OK, let's go. Go, go, go, go. It's seven hundred fifty dollars. It's a ton of money.

298
00:48:49,610 --> 00:49:02,090
Whoa. Whoa. All right. Found one. Is that correct? No, who cares? Go, go, go, go.

299
00:49:02,809 --> 00:49:11,639
Where do I get the cheesecake? Where do I get strawberry cake? Strawberry cake, a big rooster

300
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:20,869
and then what's that? Oh, my God. Oh, my God. It's a golden one. How do I pick it up?

301
00:49:21,670 --> 00:49:35,320
Gold slime. What? I have a golden chicken. Feed it. Feed it. Oh, um, um, um. Where'd he go?

302
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:43,719
Go on. I didn't have anything to feed it with. I didn't have anything to feed.

303
00:49:44,519 --> 00:49:49,960
Are these golden chickens? Oh, no. These are just regular chickens. They're just regular

304
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:56,489
fucking chickens. I thought they were gold. I thought he was shitting out like a golden

305
00:49:56,489 --> 00:50:01,929
goose with golden eggs or something. I don't know. All right. I got 30 minutes to get a cheesecake.

306
00:50:02,650 --> 00:50:18,039
Look at these crystals. Holy shit. What's that? Pod? Whoa. What is that? Visit the ranch house

307
00:50:18,039 --> 00:50:28,710
to manage a secret style. It's free. Okay. What do I need? I need, uh, five cheesecakes

308
00:50:29,829 --> 00:50:52,550
and what's that? Break the box. Break the box. A heartbeat. What else fell out?

309
00:50:53,590 --> 00:50:59,110
Something else fell out. I don't want these fucking chickens. I don't want any chickens.

310
00:50:59,110 --> 00:51:06,920
I don't want chickens. I don't want these chickens. Dash boots. What is that? What is this? A giant

311
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:15,420
clam. Is it evil? I think it's evil. These awful ravenous rainbows. Oh,

312
00:51:18,519 --> 00:51:22,199
I'm so overwhelmed right now. This game's too interesting. All right. I need cheese. There it

313
00:51:22,199 --> 00:51:39,369
is. Um, I need five of these. Cubary. It looks like they hang on like little cube trees. Cool.

314
00:51:40,329 --> 00:51:58,440
All right. I have a heartbeat too. Come on. Any more of those? Oh, lock treasure pod. Fuck. Plant

315
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:09,139
the beat. I know, but I need, um, this is so overwhelming. Yes. All right. I got five cubaries.

316
00:52:10,519 --> 00:52:15,960
All right. No, sorry. Let me say that better. I have five cubaries. I have five cubaries. No,

317
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:21,369
cubaries. Cubaries. Cubaries. There we go. Flip that one. That's one you could use in your project.

318
00:52:25,780 --> 00:52:37,000
All right. Now I need a rooster. Is there like a quest log or something? Because I have five of

319
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:48,860
those. I needed, what else did I need? A rooster. Open the box. Did I open that box? Did I miss the

320
00:52:48,860 --> 00:52:56,260
box? I don't have any room for it. I'm not getting rid of my gold plort. No, no, no. I gotta get,

321
00:52:56,260 --> 00:53:05,719
I gotta bring this shit back. Go back and sell. Yeah, I'm going back and selling. I haven't

322
00:53:05,719 --> 00:53:18,440
gone the right way. Um, I think so. You're playing Pikmin 1. It's harder than Pikmin 2. No.

323
00:53:19,159 --> 00:53:31,110
I'm not gonna play Pikmin 1. Sorry. Mushroom. I really enjoyed Pikmin. I thought it was a really

324
00:53:31,110 --> 00:53:39,480
cool franchise. I've watched the cartoon. A liar. I didn't watch the YouTube cartoon.

325
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:48,619
Just told you I was going to. Okay, so I gotta get this right. How much does, I don't have time

326
00:53:48,619 --> 00:53:54,579
to just fuck around. Okay, I need four of those. Where do I even find those flying guys? I'll be

327
00:53:54,579 --> 00:54:02,329
out here. Okay. So how do I deposit this? Five? Wow, it's not, 23 minutes. I need five, four of

328
00:54:02,329 --> 00:54:13,690
these in one giant thing. All right. A gold plort is worth a lot of money. This shit's worth 281

329
00:54:13,690 --> 00:54:20,730
bucks. But if I feed a gold plort to one of these little slimes, I will have a golden slime.

330
00:54:21,610 --> 00:54:35,989
And that would get never ending golden shits. No, don't. Don't do it. Doesn't work.

331
00:54:36,789 --> 00:54:40,280
Lead it to a big one. So if I feed a golden plort to one of these big cats,

332
00:54:41,079 --> 00:54:50,869
it's not going to give me a big golden big cat. Stop. What? Well, first of all,

333
00:54:50,869 --> 00:55:11,369
let's feed people chickens. They eat chicken? You guys don't eat chicken?

334
00:55:13,750 --> 00:55:23,880
They can't eat children. They can. I guess not. All right. I want to plant this heartbeat.

335
00:55:24,599 --> 00:55:31,579
Can I change the fruit that's on here? Remove crops. Okay. I want to plant the heartbeat.

336
00:55:36,179 --> 00:55:45,300
10 cents. Okay. Heartbeat. Now growing heartbeats. Yeah, they're probably just way better. Cool.

337
00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:54,440
Now I need a chicken coop. I only have 22 minutes to get. Okay, I got to find one of these big

338
00:55:54,440 --> 00:56:03,579
chickens. What do I do with the chickens? I'm just going to put them in the cage. Whatever.

339
00:56:05,239 --> 00:56:14,730
I think they're not going to go anywhere. All right. Hurry. Four flying purples and one hamster.

340
00:56:17,460 --> 00:56:25,050
Can I store this in like a storage unit? Sell the gold. Sell the gold. No, I'm keeping it. I

341
00:56:25,050 --> 00:56:28,090
don't want to sell it. I'm going to turn it into a golden rooster or whatever. I don't know.

342
00:56:30,949 --> 00:56:37,800
I got an email. I don't care. All right. I need the flying things wherever they are.

343
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:47,500
I'm going to just explore. I have 20 minutes to get it. Look for flying shit.

344
00:56:52,420 --> 00:57:02,550
Now what about over here? What can I find a flying guy? They only come out at night.

345
00:57:05,579 --> 00:57:20,659
They're flying. They look mad. Only at night? What time is it right now? Am I not going to be able

346
00:57:20,659 --> 00:57:41,449
to complete this quest or in caves? Caves, caves, caves, caves, caves, caves, caves, caves, caves,

347
00:57:41,449 --> 00:58:01,320
caves. You can find it in that cave. Where can I get it? A cave over here. Cave? Nope. There's a

348
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:18,840
big boy. Cave? I need a cave. No cave. I see a cave over there. I almost walked off the edge.

349
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:27,269
This is pretty. And the chicken too. Yeah, this is locked. I can't go in there.

350
00:58:28,070 --> 00:58:46,360
I don't see, there's no animals or anything over here. Oh, a box. Drop gold plort in C.

351
00:58:47,320 --> 00:58:53,559
Dude, does it turn the whole sea gold? Does the whole ocean turn to gold and I can suck up the

352
00:58:53,559 --> 00:59:10,519
gold? You're so fucking cool. I found a bird. That was really loud. All right. I know I need,

353
00:59:12,389 --> 00:59:16,389
I want a carrot. Get rid of this pog fruit. Dude, it's going to turn the whole ocean into

354
00:59:16,389 --> 00:59:37,769
pog ocean. Okay. Now I need those flying insects. Where are they? You dead? It was a very graceful

355
00:59:37,769 --> 00:59:53,670
end. Dead. I didn't kill him. He's shit. Where are these flying insect things?

356
00:59:54,309 --> 01:00:02,679
And I'm running out of time. Sorry. I almost just jumped over the edge.

357
01:00:04,780 --> 01:00:19,619
He chose to fall. Yeah, he didn't have to do that. Oh man. I need, I need these.

358
01:00:22,500 --> 01:00:26,150
I have to start making money. That was a good block.

359
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:56,219
Cave. I would consider this to be nighttime. They're not flying around. Shit. Come on.

360
01:00:56,940 --> 01:01:16,659
Need to wait a little longer. I'm waiting. Don't swear. This is a kid's game.

361
01:01:19,320 --> 01:01:33,690
Whatever you say. Just truck you. He's really hungry. Feed you here. Come here. You're really

362
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:59,030
hungry. What do you want? Out of here. Later. It's definitely nighttime. Where are they?

363
01:02:02,739 --> 01:02:12,579
Go home. Home, home, home, home, home, home, home. Why do I have to go home?

364
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:38,139
You're full. Go home. What do I get out of these? Don't eat them. No.

365
01:02:39,099 --> 01:03:02,329
Got it. Crazy. What's going on? Every time I have, I'm going to do it every time I have

366
01:03:02,329 --> 01:03:13,659
an opportunity. I love that. There you go. Here's your hen. Give me my dog. I am invincible. I am

367
01:03:13,659 --> 01:03:20,949
invincible. Don't eat that. Don't eat that. This is mine. Don't eat that. Don't eat. How are they

368
01:03:20,949 --> 01:03:34,070
getting out? Don't eat the chicken. They're starving. Did he eat it? I probably needed

369
01:03:34,070 --> 01:03:42,949
one of those. Is it rare? How are you guys getting out? Food. There's food over there.

370
01:03:43,989 --> 01:03:48,230
Just make a giant wall. Some of us will get to eat at least. Send the children out.

371
01:03:50,699 --> 01:04:03,510
I'm sorry. I'm working on it. I have five of these. Here. Look. I'm a good guy. I'm a good guy.

372
01:04:09,030 --> 01:04:36,820
See? I'm a good guy. No, I don't want to pick up the money. See? I'm a good guy.

373
01:04:45,659 --> 01:04:54,090
Okay. Trying to get away. This one is being carried. This one is so injured or something

374
01:04:54,090 --> 01:04:59,690
that he's carrying him back to the house where they used to live. This is sad. I'm sorry. I'll

375
01:04:59,690 --> 01:05:21,300
feed you guys. All right. I have $1,000. What if I feed you a beet? What do you do? What happened?

376
01:05:21,300 --> 01:05:28,219
What happened? What's going on? What? Get out. Get out. Get out. Get out. Get out. Get out. What

377
01:05:28,219 --> 01:05:33,179
happened? Oh, my God. Get these guys out of here. What's going on? What's going on? What's going on?

378
01:05:33,179 --> 01:05:42,139
What's going on? What's going on? What's going on? What's going on? It's a massacre. It's a

379
01:05:42,139 --> 01:05:53,210
fucking massacre. Get out. Get out. Get out. Get out. Do I go to sleep? Get out. Oh, my God. Go to

380
01:05:53,210 --> 01:06:06,519
sleep. Go to sleep. Go to sleep. Okay. It's like Minecraft. So, it's like Minecraft. At night,

381
01:06:06,519 --> 01:06:09,400
when it gets to be nighttime, those things spawn and start killing people.

382
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:22,150
So, now that I'm awake, they're gone. Okay. So, don't stay up so late next time.

383
01:06:28,949 --> 01:06:35,769
We have to get back to what we were doing. Everybody relax. Press F1.

384
01:07:06,139 --> 01:07:09,820
The only way to stop a tar outside of incinerating it or throwing it into the

385
01:07:09,820 --> 01:07:14,380
slime sea is with fresh water. One splash will stop a tar from spawning new tar.

386
01:07:15,019 --> 01:07:20,039
A repeated splash will destroy it entirely. Alternatively, many ranchers recommend running

387
01:07:20,039 --> 01:07:27,420
away with their arms waving and screaming. Okay. Remember, ranching largeos may be highly

388
01:07:27,420 --> 01:07:39,800
profitable, but one stray plort and you could wind up with a devastating tar outbreak. So,

389
01:07:39,800 --> 01:07:52,570
let me get that correct again. If a pink plort, if a pink bunny rabbit thing, cat, eats a,

390
01:07:54,309 --> 01:08:02,059
if a pink plort based slime eats a, oh, my God. I almost knocked my coffee over. Why is it so

391
01:08:02,059 --> 01:08:21,180
hard for me to do? When a pink slime eats a blue plort, it turns into this. Yes. No.

392
01:08:21,739 --> 01:08:28,310
A largeo eats a plort unlike the ones it produces. So, okay. When we feed something,

393
01:08:28,310 --> 01:08:35,619
when it shits out two plorts, if it doesn't shit out like a blue plort, if it eats a blue

394
01:08:35,619 --> 01:08:45,380
prismatic plort thing, then that's fine. You have to feed it whatever it shits out. I get it.

395
01:08:46,340 --> 01:08:50,020
If you feed it something that it does not shit out, it's going to turn into one of those.

396
01:08:50,819 --> 01:09:05,560
Did they eat the tree? They ate the tree. Oh, no, no. Okay. All right. I see. I see.

397
01:09:09,289 --> 01:09:14,039
Okay. I'm good. I'm understanding. I'm understanding. I'm going to just pick up

398
01:09:14,039 --> 01:09:20,180
the stray plorts. I need to put, you go back in here. I get it. I understand the game.

399
01:09:20,979 --> 01:09:32,500
Get in there. Motherfucker. Feed them, you monster. I'm trying to get that first of all.

400
01:09:33,460 --> 01:09:51,449
Just wait. I need to. God damn it. All right. Hold on. $307. Oh, my God. I don't care.

401
01:09:52,090 --> 01:10:07,050
That's so much money. I don't even care. Come here, guys. Come here. Collect everybody back.

402
01:10:07,930 --> 01:10:20,579
You literally can't do anything else with gold plorts at all. They're all coming back in. Wait,

403
01:10:20,579 --> 01:10:37,510
the food's in the cage now. You could hold it. Yeah, I could. Increase in value. Yeah.

404
01:10:38,229 --> 01:10:51,369
Okay. Come here. This game is really cool. I really like this. I bet I got everybody killed.

405
01:10:55,770 --> 01:11:03,000
Stop farming just pink. I know, but my tiny brain is still trying to comprehend the game.

406
01:11:03,560 --> 01:11:15,350
It's going to be pink for a little bit longer. Okay. So these are almost done. I want to buy

407
01:11:15,350 --> 01:11:21,109
the watering thing. Pulse wave. Cool. Push the slimes away. That's an upgrade. All right. I want

408
01:11:21,109 --> 01:11:28,619
the sprinkler. Always water, making them grow twice as fast. I want that. X crops always yield the

409
01:11:28,619 --> 01:11:36,229
maximum harvest. Yup. A scare slime is a stuffed tar model designed to keep wandering slimes away

410
01:11:36,229 --> 01:11:43,609
from your crops. Simple but terrifying. So the wall's higher. That's right. The wall's higher on

411
01:11:43,609 --> 01:12:01,899
this one. It's an air net. Okay. Cool. Much better. I'll have much more food. One of them survived.

412
01:12:02,619 --> 01:12:16,460
I love it. Come here. I'll feed you in a second. So what do you guys poop out? You guys poop out.

413
01:12:17,180 --> 01:12:28,659
You guys don't eat those? What do you guys eat? What are they? Oh yeah. So you poop out

414
01:12:30,729 --> 01:12:39,130
tabby plort and pink plorts. They eat everything. Okay. So how come you didn't eat the

415
01:12:39,130 --> 01:12:46,890
feed? So if I feed you a tabby plort, you're going to be very happy about it.

416
01:12:49,180 --> 01:12:56,460
If I feed him a rock plort, he'll turn into one of those scary things.

417
01:12:57,420 --> 01:13:02,060
Because it says if you feed them a plort that's not theirs, they turn into a tar thing, right?

418
01:13:03,029 --> 01:13:09,850
I don't want to do that. I could feed a rock plort to one of these and they'll turn into

419
01:13:10,729 --> 01:13:22,220
aha. Cool. And then I bring you over here. Now I've got you guys over here

420
01:13:23,100 --> 01:13:31,079
and then I could do tabby plort who wants to turn into a tabby. Okay. We've got kitties.

421
01:13:36,069 --> 01:13:44,310
And then these guys have more yield. You have to be careful. We've got kitties. All right. I get it.

422
01:13:46,090 --> 01:13:59,430
Very, very cool. I make a bunch of cats. I make a bunch of big ones. Just put them all in here.

423
01:14:07,689 --> 01:14:30,819
Okay. Stay in. Yes. Okay. Because eventually these guys are going to turn into other ones.

424
01:14:30,819 --> 01:14:34,699
I'm going to stop. What? He can't. He's not learning. What do you mean?

425
01:14:36,539 --> 01:14:41,319
Eventually I'm going to have a place for the cats, a place for the rocks, a place. Yeah.

426
01:14:43,220 --> 01:14:48,260
Separate the rocks. Don't. Get the rocks out. Get the rocks out. Get the rocks. All right. Because

427
01:14:48,260 --> 01:14:52,180
I get it. I get it. I understand. I get it. I get it. I get it. I get it. I get it. I get it.

428
01:14:52,180 --> 01:14:56,100
You're right. Yep. Yep. Yep. Okay. I understand. Because if they poop out something, it's one of

429
01:14:56,100 --> 01:15:00,659
them going to eat it. The same problem is going to happen again. Okay. I get it. Right. Right.

430
01:15:00,659 --> 01:15:05,140
Because they poop out the rock thing and one of these guys will eat the rock thing and then

431
01:15:05,140 --> 01:15:08,100
they'll turn into one of those things and the whole thing happens all over again. Right. Okay.

432
01:15:09,220 --> 01:15:22,420
Stay away from these. We're good. I've got 250 bucks. Are these ready to be harvested?

433
01:15:23,880 --> 01:15:27,880
They are. I'm going to make two gardens, I think. Is that stupid?

434
01:15:28,840 --> 01:15:47,779
It's two garden plots. Oh, good idea. Garden. I'm doing beets. I'm a beet. I'm a beet grower.

435
01:15:50,539 --> 01:16:07,029
Who's hungry? This dude's a beet freak. Nice. All right. Now activate my sucker.

436
01:16:20,659 --> 01:16:32,460
Sucker didn't get it all. Sucker. Now I can sell all this.

437
01:16:34,460 --> 01:16:39,500
Okay. So this is a tabby. So I could make some more tabbies. I could make tabbies and put a bunch

438
01:16:39,500 --> 01:16:49,350
of tabbies in here. But eventually aren't they going to start getting out? Yeah. They'll bounce.

439
01:16:49,350 --> 01:16:55,750
Right. Okay. So we're going to leave it as is now. I'm going to sell these tabby plots.

440
01:16:56,310 --> 01:17:11,260
How much are you going to get for this? Ooh. 27 bucks a pop. 400 bucks. Cool.

441
01:17:12,060 --> 01:17:20,020
Anybody have another quest? If possible, please acquire the following for a future study. My thanks.

442
01:17:22,170 --> 01:17:31,399
Oh, that's not very much money. It's not a whole lot. It's not very much money at all.

443
01:17:32,199 --> 01:17:41,130
Nine chickens though. It'll be a good starter for a coop. Yeah, that's a bad deal. It's not a hard

444
01:17:41,130 --> 01:17:50,840
quest. No, I mean it's not. Should I just do it? I guess let's do it. Here you go. What do I give it

445
01:17:50,840 --> 01:18:04,979
to you? How do I deliver you? Oh, they need to be little. They need to be little. You don't want

446
01:18:04,979 --> 01:18:18,140
adults? I thought maybe I could do adults. I don't know. Wait, the color matters? Oh.

447
01:18:19,420 --> 01:18:28,659
Wait, does that mean I can do this? It has to be the baby version. All right. So I have to get the

448
01:18:28,659 --> 01:18:34,090
little baby. All right. I can do that. Let's do it right now. Let's go. If this sinks in right now,

449
01:18:34,090 --> 01:18:40,659
it's a billion off the debt. If it doesn't sink in, then I will whistle. I'll take it. I'll fucking

450
01:18:40,659 --> 01:19:08,569
I'll do it. I'll take it. Thank you. No deal. Who wants to beat? Come on, eat it. Okay. I need to

451
01:19:08,569 --> 01:19:22,630
go get eight regular bunnies and eight regular rock monsters. Go. Eight little bunnies and eight

452
01:19:31,539 --> 01:19:38,140
big cats. I don't know. They look like they could be anything. Oh, shit. There we go.

453
01:19:41,539 --> 01:19:53,510
You know, it's it's the carrots. I keep seeing the carrots and then eating the carrots.

454
01:19:57,350 --> 01:20:16,439
No, don't eat that. Five. No. Okay. Tabby. Plorts. Who cares about plorts? Wait, I do.

455
01:20:22,939 --> 01:20:36,359
I don't want the fucking carrot. I want the plorts. Get away from me or I'm gonna start swinging.

456
01:20:42,359 --> 01:21:05,270
I smell the plort. You're clogging my plort gun up. Okay, I need more Tabby plorts. Damn,

457
01:21:05,270 --> 01:21:15,369
this game is fun. Oh, should I? No. It's eight. Oh, eight, eight, eight, eight, eight. Those things

458
01:21:15,369 --> 01:21:32,359
are cool, but I don't want them. All right. I just need Tabby's. I can also take them, right?

459
01:21:33,239 --> 01:21:36,920
I need more bunnies. They're not. I just I keep thinking they're eating carrots.

460
01:21:37,880 --> 01:21:55,050
Get the chickens. No, they all eat carrots. It doesn't matter. Okay, think about this. In my

461
01:21:55,050 --> 01:22:05,720
brain, cat does not eat carrot. Like a kitty cat does not eat a carrot. It's his tiny brain.

462
01:22:06,600 --> 01:22:20,619
I need more of this brain. Cats don't eat carrots. They eat cat food and like fish.

463
01:22:29,479 --> 01:22:45,590
Where? I need more of these. Cats eat carrots. You pothead cats do not eat carrots. I need more

464
01:22:45,590 --> 01:22:56,180
carrots. Cats eat carrots. No, they don't. They do not eat carrots. Cats eat like gazelles. They

465
01:22:56,180 --> 01:23:15,619
don't eat carrots. Can I multiply these? How do I multiply a Tabby? Can I somehow do something

466
01:23:15,619 --> 01:23:29,699
to multiply them? You can't. Who cares, Jerma? It's a game. I can't even read the chat. Is that

467
01:23:29,699 --> 01:23:37,420
going a million miles per hour? I cannot. Okay. Well, I need more of them then. Okay. What if

468
01:23:37,420 --> 01:23:54,810
I give you extra? Did I not put these guys in here? What are they bad? That was like a get me out of

469
01:23:54,810 --> 01:24:11,770
here. Okay. Very good. Cool. We'll do some feeding. We'll do some cultivating. Are these ready?

470
01:24:12,409 --> 01:24:23,340
No. Let's do some feeding. All right. Time for food. Excellent. Now I'm going to come suck it up.

471
01:24:26,199 --> 01:24:34,579
Eat big rocks. Yes. That's too many, I think. Too many. Too many. Too many. Too many. Too many rocks.

472
01:24:34,579 --> 01:24:42,340
Too many. Too many. Way too many. Way too many rocks. I think that's way too many. Is it going

473
01:24:42,340 --> 01:24:53,050
to get out? Maybe not. I need one of those. All right. I need one of those devices on here.

474
01:24:53,689 --> 01:25:04,119
What do they cost? 500 bucks. Take some of the pinks out. Yeah. Yeah. Get out of here.

475
01:25:05,079 --> 01:25:11,619
Give me the little ones. I'm taking some out. I don't know. What do I do with them though?

476
01:25:12,260 --> 01:25:27,420
I just throw them back into the wild? All right. I'm going to put them back in the wild.

477
01:25:33,659 --> 01:25:40,069
Okay. I think we're good. Very nice. I'm going to sell this stuff.

478
01:25:41,029 --> 01:25:54,579
What are we doing on the market? Rock plots went up about 20%. 700 bucks.

479
01:25:59,510 --> 01:26:09,380
Okay. Cool. Wait. How much time do I have left on this? 12 minutes. If I sleep,

480
01:26:09,380 --> 01:26:19,050
is this going to fuck it up? It will. Yeah. I have to do this now? All right. Shit. Okay.

481
01:26:19,050 --> 01:26:24,890
I need to get some more bunnies. They're not bunnies. I can't help it. I'm sorry. They eat

482
01:26:24,890 --> 01:26:44,439
carrots. Whatever. Cats. I don't see any. God damn it. I need...

483
01:26:59,449 --> 01:27:08,779
Now, is there a problem with staying out late at night? Okay. What happened to you?

484
01:27:12,579 --> 01:27:32,359
I don't see any cats. Yeah. I need four more. Four more. I got a roostro. These are cool.

485
01:27:36,260 --> 01:27:46,300
If I have paint, might as well just get them all. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

486
01:27:50,329 --> 01:28:05,770
Cool. All right. I need another tabby. They seem like they're not spawning as much as the rock

487
01:28:05,770 --> 01:28:31,159
guys are. Go to the next location. Like through here? Right there. Wait. Did I miss one? All

488
01:28:31,159 --> 01:28:42,100
right. All right. All right. All right. All right. Whoa. They're angry. Run. Oh my God. They're

489
01:28:42,100 --> 01:29:03,939
killing each other. Requires a slime key. I can't go to a new area. Eat these guys? Hungry?

490
01:29:03,939 --> 01:29:19,300
They were hungry. All right. Fuck off. Fuck off. Fuck off. I kind of want whatever this is.

491
01:29:20,939 --> 01:29:33,000
Oh, it's a phosphor. Definitely taking that. Whatever these are. Any more phosphors?

492
01:29:33,960 --> 01:29:48,789
Four phosphor. Hi, phosphor. Cool. The roostro died. Well, I wanted to... I want these phosphor

493
01:29:48,789 --> 01:30:06,500
plarts. Okay. Get me back out of here. Oh. I kind of watched. There's nothing I could do.

494
01:30:07,220 --> 01:30:24,619
There's nothing I could do about this. I have to leave. What happened over here? Did I? No.

495
01:30:24,619 --> 01:30:38,810
What do I do? I need more cats. There's so much money here too. Find a cat. I can't.

496
01:30:44,250 --> 01:30:57,000
I'm trying. I have eight minutes. Tank booster. Allows your vac tanks to hold 30 units of whatever

497
01:30:57,000 --> 01:31:07,159
you can back up. Energy boost. Water tank. Store fresh water. Get pack dash boots. Pulse wave.

498
01:31:07,960 --> 01:31:16,899
I think I want the booster. And then the water tank. A blast of fresh water will calm down any

499
01:31:16,899 --> 01:31:22,100
slime for a short while or dissolve those terrible tar slimes. A water garden's crops also grow

500
01:31:22,100 --> 01:31:30,979
faster. Oh, shit. Can I just sit here and hold this up? I need to put this into water.

501
01:31:30,979 --> 01:31:53,300
Take a splash. Okay, cool. What are these worth? 26. I'm gonna hold on to them. All right. I have

502
01:31:53,300 --> 01:32:08,920
seven minutes to get a couple of cats. Fill this shit up. I can hold 30 of everything now.

503
01:32:10,039 --> 01:32:16,199
Which is like, that's insane. You know what I mean? That's insanity. That's insane, dude.

504
01:32:17,079 --> 01:32:43,210
I can hold 30 stacks up to 30. That's insane. Re-ranging. Cool. Okay. Where are these cats?

505
01:32:43,930 --> 01:33:10,010
Oh, he's dead. All right. Well, whatever. I need cat. Cat. Cat. Can't suck up the water.

506
01:33:10,010 --> 01:33:23,819
Go to where the big cat was. Where was he? Over here, right? Where's that big cat?

507
01:33:31,130 --> 01:33:42,069
Hmm. You stayed up all night. Oh, these are the cats. Cats. Cats. Cats. Cats.

508
01:33:43,989 --> 01:33:47,109
Don't touch them. Don't touch them. Don't touch them. Don't touch them. You fucker.

509
01:33:48,149 --> 01:34:12,550
Stop eating. Stop. Give me the cats. Get out of here. Okay. I need two more. I need one more.

510
01:34:19,060 --> 01:34:28,460
One more cat. I'm good. Right next to me. I don't see a cat. Was there a cat?

511
01:34:28,539 --> 01:35:16,420
See one? Don't eat that. Cool. You have any cats? Trying to shoot it down his mouth.

512
01:35:17,539 --> 01:35:31,000
Feed it. What do I feed it? It wants meat. Meat. Like, I need a chicken. All right. Chicken.

513
01:35:32,020 --> 01:35:52,659
Hi. There's a chicken. Fuck. Well, I'll come back tomorrow. I need one more bunny. One

514
01:35:52,659 --> 01:36:07,750
will spawn on the way back. Quest failed. Not yet. End of the stream voice. Got it. Go.

515
01:36:10,979 --> 01:36:17,829
Stop fucking with me. Stop fucking with me. Guys, I want you to stop fucking with me.

516
01:36:18,470 --> 01:36:27,180
Come on. Stop fucking with me. Hey, Jimmy. I'd like it if you would stop fucking with me.

517
01:36:27,819 --> 01:36:49,399
All right. Give me the quest. Ding. Oops. Don't eat that. You weren't supposed to eat that.

518
01:36:49,800 --> 01:36:59,739
Okay. We're good. Looking good. Looking good. Cool. I got eight hen hens. Now I got to make a

519
01:36:59,739 --> 01:37:08,779
chicken coop. Keep the chickens in their place preventing the uprising. Yes. Come on in there.

520
01:37:09,340 --> 01:37:25,159
They just fly out. Why are they not flying out? Feed big cat. All right. Yeah. Hold on.

521
01:37:26,600 --> 01:37:29,880
I need to say I haven't slept in like three days. Give me one minute.

522
01:37:30,680 --> 01:37:33,319
Chickens can't fly, silly. No, but they can go.

523
01:37:48,810 --> 01:38:00,970
Um, I'm just going to... What happened? Did it get bigger?

524
01:38:10,229 --> 01:38:21,380
Activate. Stop it. Stop it. I want these. Stop it. God damn it. There's too many in here.

525
01:38:22,659 --> 01:38:47,750
There's too many in there. Whatever. I need to... Oh, that felt so good.

526
01:38:54,420 --> 01:39:05,659
Okay. Oh my God. $334 more gold. Activate. And now I want to get in here and I want to suck this

527
01:39:05,659 --> 01:39:33,590
shit up. Come here. Fuck out of the way. Can I die in here? I'm going to die in here. Give me that.

528
01:39:34,949 --> 01:39:50,229
Give me that. Rock Lords. Cool. And nine. Get back in there. Get in there.

529
01:39:50,550 --> 01:40:00,039
Okay. Cool. I got a pog fruit. Let's just feed it to somebody. Upgrade your suck. Yeah, I will.

530
01:40:01,989 --> 01:40:15,880
Pull these out. Make some money. All right. I got a lot to sell. Let's go make some money

531
01:40:16,920 --> 01:40:18,920
and I'll come back and I'll be able to have some more food.

532
01:40:32,600 --> 01:40:37,270
I've got a thousand bucks. I'm going to hold on to these. How much are they worth?

533
01:40:37,989 --> 01:40:42,409
Now I'll get rid of like... I need to make another cage to have these guys.

534
01:40:45,579 --> 01:40:53,340
You little shit. You little fuck. You little dickhead. No.

535
01:40:57,369 --> 01:41:03,909
Just eat one of those and get over here. Get in this new cage I'm going to make.

536
01:41:04,789 --> 01:41:16,729
Fuck. I didn't... You ate all the chickens. You jumped over the fence and ate them all.

537
01:41:16,729 --> 01:41:25,529
You little bastard. I had like 10 in here. You ate 10 chickens. You had 10 chickens. 10. 10.

538
01:41:28,390 --> 01:41:33,270
10. He's dead. He's dead. He exploded. That's what happens when you eat too much.

539
01:41:33,270 --> 01:41:38,869
You ate. He's dead. That fucking guy died. Cool. Whatever. What? Why? Get...

540
01:41:42,520 --> 01:41:45,960
Where's my mallets? Why can I just squish them? I want to just like...

541
01:41:46,840 --> 01:41:53,380
Like Galaga used to do with fucking watermelons. Get rid of this thing. I don't want it here.

542
01:41:54,100 --> 01:42:08,710
I'll be so sad when I do that. I was so sad. I feel so bad about that and he didn't even

543
01:42:08,710 --> 01:42:21,880
do anything. It was like his friend. I'm sorry. Very cool. I love it. All right.

544
01:42:23,079 --> 01:42:36,810
Okay. I got 30 foods. Even more, but I can't hold them. All right. I want... I just got all

545
01:42:36,810 --> 01:42:41,449
those fucking chickens. I'm so annoyed by that. I just got 10 of them. He ate 10 chickens and

546
01:42:41,449 --> 01:42:48,340
fucking exploded. All right. Silo. You can't take it with you when you go. So put it... So this is

547
01:42:48,340 --> 01:43:04,229
storage. I think I need this. Let's put some of the food in here. Okay. I got 30 of these.

548
01:43:05,399 --> 01:43:12,520
Let's say you switch... That's actually really important. Eye walls for the chickens. God damn

549
01:43:12,520 --> 01:43:20,310
it. Spring grass attracts scuttle bugs that chickens just love to eat and will produce

550
01:43:20,310 --> 01:43:25,560
eggs. You guys make eggs? Well, you would have if you'd all had to get eaten alive.

551
01:43:26,199 --> 01:43:42,550
I'm going to store these too. Okay. This is awesome. I love this game. Okay.

552
01:43:43,189 --> 01:43:53,500
365 bucks. What can I... Can I upgrade my body? Dash boots, power core. I can upgrade myself.

553
01:43:58,500 --> 01:44:09,380
Get pack. Okay. How do I use it? You just float around if you hold the space. Okay. Cool.

554
01:44:10,260 --> 01:44:23,539
Still harvest here that I need to get. One. Somebody eat that. Good. Okay. Now wait. Hold on.

555
01:44:23,539 --> 01:44:34,550
One. Looks good so far. Suck that up. Tell this stuff one more time. I'm going to get another

556
01:44:34,550 --> 01:44:52,229
quest. I like doing the quests. I'm working on a new recipe. Help me out. 14 pogfruits for

557
01:44:52,229 --> 01:45:00,250
strawberries. That's not a bad deal. I got 20 minutes. I have to pee really badly. I'll be

558
01:45:00,250 --> 01:45:12,810
right back. First break. What the hell was that? I think it's unplugged. All right. Well, I'll be

559
01:45:12,810 --> 01:50:32,390
back. Oh, look. It's Otto. Otto. Psychostreamer zirks off. Okay. I don't know why. I thought that

560
01:50:32,390 --> 01:50:56,890
was me zirking off. I was like, Oh God, what am I looking at? EP. All right. Let's get back to it.

561
01:50:59,460 --> 01:51:14,949
Oh, I hated that game. I'm just kidding. I'm kidding. I liked it. We'll catch that. Oh,

562
01:51:14,949 --> 01:51:25,050
there we go. He admits it. No, I'm kidding. It was a cute. I love Pikmin. You said you were

563
01:51:25,050 --> 01:51:32,180
going to stop doing that. I know I can't help it. I'm just fucking psycho. I will catch this one

564
01:51:32,180 --> 01:51:45,560
next time or we'll just catch it right now. Remember the DMT robot. Very, very cool. That's

565
01:51:45,560 --> 01:51:54,100
trippy too. It's that when we get back. Don't ever stop doing that. It's funny. Yeah. It's funny for

566
01:51:54,100 --> 01:51:58,500
like the it's funny for us, but it's not funny for somebody that comes in and it's just like,

567
01:51:58,500 --> 01:52:06,220
that's mean. I like Pikmin. Whatever. I ain't going to stop. Sorry. All right. So what was I

568
01:52:06,220 --> 01:52:19,430
doing? I was. What was I doing? Let's look at how many I was going to say. I gotta give those a

569
01:52:19,430 --> 01:52:29,399
better name. All right. I need 14 Pogfruits and four strawberry cheesecakes. I think I can handle

570
01:52:29,399 --> 01:52:46,119
that. Hens are doing all right. Got. All right. Let's go read the email. Oops. Let me come in a

571
01:52:46,119 --> 01:52:59,909
little closer. Hiya. Somebody else to fucking read this. Okay. Okay. Carrots improve your night

572
01:52:59,909 --> 01:53:14,810
vision. Yeah. A lot of interest in the huge emails was the TLDR. TLDR fruits and vegetables

573
01:53:14,810 --> 01:53:29,529
give you plus 10% extra health. I pet cactus. You know, I kill every plant I touch, but I promise

574
01:53:29,529 --> 01:53:32,649
you this one will last. I mean, if it can't keep the cactus alive, then clearly something's wrong.

575
01:53:32,970 --> 01:53:37,720
When I look at it, I think of you out there on the range doing your thing. Hope you're okay.

576
01:53:37,720 --> 01:53:54,729
I'm seeing the time to just switch on permanent DND. I'm asleep. All right. I'm on my way. I need

577
01:53:54,729 --> 01:54:12,060
Pogfruits and strawberry cheesecakes. I see Pogfruit. I'll get the carrots too because I like

578
01:54:12,060 --> 01:54:45,770
them. Pogfruits. Nope. I was supposed to bring a chicken, right? To feed the big guy. Pogfruit tree.

579
01:54:45,770 --> 01:54:54,869
Nope. Nothing on there. Nothing on here. Yeah. Is there anything left? No. Thank you. All right.

580
01:54:54,869 --> 01:55:04,939
We're going to feed the big guy a, just a hen hen. Why the fuck is this game in the Grand Canyon?

581
01:55:04,939 --> 01:55:30,170
Why not? That's kind of cool. No, I don't want anything. All right. Here he is. Hen hen. Just

582
01:55:30,170 --> 01:55:47,619
ricocheted down his throat when he was asleep. Okay. You want more than what I just gave you.

583
01:55:47,619 --> 01:55:59,859
Okay. Well, here we go. I want to test this. Anyone want hen hens? Oh shit. Here they come.

584
01:56:00,739 --> 01:56:21,420
I want to eat that. I heard it. What the fuck? I'm trying to get rid of all these guys.

585
01:56:21,420 --> 01:56:55,779
I need chickens. Leave me alone. Wait. I'm going to put the babies in my den. He needs even more.

586
01:56:55,779 --> 01:56:58,260
All right. Well, I would have been able to do this too. That's annoying.

587
01:57:04,149 --> 01:57:38,300
There's one. Strawberry cheesecake. I need a few more of these, don't I? Shit. I need these.

588
01:57:38,539 --> 01:58:06,340
I'm the pink Gordo. I kind of want to go see what that thing is. Give me some of Pogfords.

589
01:58:08,340 --> 01:58:18,600
Nine. I need, I'm going to plant the Qberry. I'm planting a Qberry. I think that's the play.

590
01:58:18,600 --> 01:58:32,390
That's the pink Gordo. Oh, these things feel like I can only get a handful of them. All right. I'm

591
01:58:32,390 --> 01:58:37,699
going to just deposit the Pogfords. These are just, I can get these anywhere.

592
01:58:39,619 --> 01:58:48,920
N in here. And the little chickens. There we go. See? We're replenishing that. All right.

593
01:58:48,920 --> 01:59:10,380
Harvest this. Change it to Qberry. Okay. Change crop. Remove crops. And turn it into a Qberry tree.

594
01:59:11,180 --> 01:59:25,770
This is still fine. Hell yeah. How much time do I have? 13 minutes. That's not enough time. I need

595
01:59:25,770 --> 01:59:32,460
a rooster. That's right. I do need a rooster, don't I? Is he ready? No, not yet. All right.

596
01:59:32,460 --> 01:59:45,460
Let's do some feeding and some selling and some, let's do some selling. Here we go. 500k is

597
01:59:45,460 --> 01:59:53,619
literally a drop in the bucket. Fuck off. You know what? Is it a deal? I ain't doing, yeah.

598
01:59:56,069 --> 02:00:08,100
How did you get out? Come over here. Let him, you know what? Let him be free. He wants to be free.

599
02:00:08,100 --> 02:00:20,060
Let him be it. Go on. Bounce your heart's desire. Whatever. You too. Bounce as much as you want.

600
02:00:20,619 --> 02:00:34,920
I know you guys are hungry. Puzzle piece. What the hell is puzzle piece?

601
02:00:35,560 --> 02:00:39,380
I might not be able to do this one. I'm probably going to fail it.

602
02:00:54,569 --> 02:00:58,520
Eat up. How many are in here? I think that's a good thing to know.

603
02:01:01,210 --> 02:01:07,750
Is everybody eating? Is everybody eating? What about you guys?

604
02:01:08,710 --> 02:01:12,180
The virus. I don't know. I don't know what it is. I'm not going to get.

605
02:01:12,180 --> 02:01:25,060
This is just too many. There's too many in here.

606
02:01:26,180 --> 02:01:40,149
It was good. All right. Hold on. Give me a second. Let me sell my inventory.

607
02:01:40,149 --> 02:01:42,760
Look at how much money I'm going to make from these rock boys. They're going to be sick.

608
02:01:51,850 --> 02:01:58,890
I need to put one of those collecting things here. All right. We're good.

609
02:01:59,609 --> 02:02:09,029
Excellent. Knock it out. That link is loud. Is it loud?

610
02:02:09,829 --> 02:02:21,899
Okay. Let me do it. I got a lot of money. Hold on. This is going to be big, big, big, big payday.

611
02:02:25,500 --> 02:02:36,420
25. All right. Here we go. Check this out. All this shit is down. I'm holding it till tomorrow.

612
02:02:36,979 --> 02:02:48,420
Click the link. All right. This is loud. I'm going to be fucking furious.

613
02:02:49,380 --> 02:03:00,579
Puzzle piece. Whatever. Hold on. It is loud. It's very loud. Turn your volume down.

614
02:03:05,319 --> 02:03:17,750
Don't do it. Turn the volume down. It's loud as fuck. Okay. It's loud as fuck. It's super loud.

615
02:03:17,750 --> 02:03:29,300
Oh my God. What are you doing? I didn't even click it. My bot just destroyed it, I think.

616
02:03:31,289 --> 02:03:36,279
There it is. I'm clicking it. Let's see what it does. Clicked it. Did I? What the hell is this?

617
02:03:37,590 --> 02:03:53,300
Click me. Are you serious? Three months ago. That fucking was so loud. I thought it wasn't

618
02:03:53,300 --> 02:04:02,460
that loud. My desktop audio is turned almost to zero. I'm telling you right now, my desktop

619
02:04:02,460 --> 02:04:13,699
audio was almost zero. Imagine if I had not turned it all the way down. Wait, show this? Hold on.

620
02:04:13,699 --> 02:04:48,649
Hold on a second. That hurt. It did. It hurt me. Where is it? Hold on. Hold on. Let's see what

621
02:04:48,649 --> 02:04:59,079
Jigsaw has to say. I'm trying to get all the fucking way down. What even is this shit?

622
02:05:18,489 --> 02:05:25,130
What does Jigsaw have to say to us? 500k is a drop in the bucket. Is that what it is? It's a deal.

623
02:05:25,850 --> 02:06:13,300
All right, here we go. I don't have a Rubik's Cube.

624
02:06:25,050 --> 02:06:32,680
Hey, Saw. Saw, you forgot to leave a Rubik's Cube in the room. There's no Rubik's Cube in here.

625
02:06:38,710 --> 02:06:45,699
No, there's no Rubik's Cube in the room. Are you sure? No, I don't see one anywhere, man.

626
02:06:48,149 --> 02:06:51,590
I'm certain there's a Rubik's Cube in this somewhere. Maybe it fell under the chair.

627
02:06:53,079 --> 02:06:56,119
It's not under the fucking chair. There's nothing. I'm standing.

628
02:06:56,840 --> 02:07:01,850
There's a chair in there. There's a chair in there. I have no idea where it is.

629
02:07:33,289 --> 02:07:49,609
His voice changer is so fucked up. He's sitting there going like this. Can I leave the room?

630
02:07:51,369 --> 02:07:59,029
It's tricky. My voice changer gets fucked up all the time. Can you hear me? Can you hear me?

631
02:07:59,670 --> 02:08:06,199
I can hear you. Well, that means that you know very well that gas, well that gas,

632
02:08:06,199 --> 02:08:14,420
that gas, gas is filling the room. You've done that bit like a thousand times by now.

633
02:08:14,420 --> 02:08:23,100
And I read Saw 2's script and it sucked. I mean, it sucked. Saw 2 is by far the best in the series.

634
02:08:23,739 --> 02:08:41,579
There's no Rubik's Cube there. What's the question? My stomach. If you get my favorite foods wrong,

635
02:08:41,579 --> 02:08:50,279
gas is going to fill the room. Make your choice. Please say pizza.

636
02:08:54,100 --> 02:08:57,859
Well, pizza's not really that good for you. How about tacos?

637
02:08:58,819 --> 02:09:04,630
Saw doesn't like tacos. They're messy. You can't eat them in the car.

638
02:09:04,630 --> 02:09:10,539
You're eating food in the car? Yes. I eat food in the car.

639
02:09:10,539 --> 02:09:16,020
That doesn't sound like a safe thing to do. Pizza's really easy to eat in the car.

640
02:09:16,020 --> 02:09:19,619
You have pizza in the car? Am I going to get any of this money,

641
02:09:19,619 --> 02:09:25,100
by the way, because of the Rubik's Cube? Nah, just forget about all that. This is the end.

642
02:09:25,100 --> 02:09:29,319
This is just to scare the shit out of people. So they do my fucked up tasks.

643
02:09:29,319 --> 02:09:34,390
Nobody actually has to do any of this stuff. The door is open. Leads out to the outside.

644
02:09:35,029 --> 02:09:38,409
You can actually walk out right now. See the exit sign over there?

645
02:09:39,770 --> 02:09:42,409
Yeah, I do. You can just walk out if you want.

646
02:09:42,409 --> 02:09:47,449
When this goes to zero, nothing happens. So I can just leave?

647
02:09:47,449 --> 02:09:48,970
Yeah. All right. Well, I'm just going to leave.

648
02:09:50,460 --> 02:09:54,380
That was kind of fun. I guess you kidnapped me and took me.

649
02:09:55,020 --> 02:10:01,340
Yeah, I did. I'm in jail for all that because I just keep kidnapping people and putting them

650
02:10:01,340 --> 02:10:07,020
in these chairs. But you still didn't say what I was going to eat.

651
02:10:07,659 --> 02:10:12,439
I'm going to say, you know what, I'm going to say pizza.

652
02:10:12,439 --> 02:10:16,840
Pizza, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, gas, gas, gas.

653
02:10:17,720 --> 02:10:19,449
You really like saying that, don't you?

654
02:10:19,529 --> 02:10:21,689
No saying that word. It's my favorite.

655
02:10:21,689 --> 02:10:31,859
One of the people, there's a guy with a big spider web.

656
02:10:31,859 --> 02:10:42,899
Giant spider. It was really insurance for all that she had or something.

657
02:10:42,899 --> 02:10:46,069
Okay. Well, I'll talk to you later. I'm going to get up and leave.

658
02:10:46,789 --> 02:10:48,170
See you later. It's good to see you again.

659
02:10:54,409 --> 02:10:56,010
This door, that door back there?

660
02:10:56,010 --> 02:10:56,729
Yeah, down behind.

661
02:10:56,729 --> 02:11:14,859
All right. See you later. This door is locked.

662
02:11:16,840 --> 02:11:18,649
That one's locked?

663
02:11:18,649 --> 02:11:20,810
Yeah, this one's locked. I can't get out of that one.

664
02:11:20,810 --> 02:11:23,050
Well, they're all supposed to be unlocked. I'm sorry. I don't know what happened.

665
02:11:25,510 --> 02:11:29,590
You didn't code that. You didn't code this correctly, I don't think.

666
02:11:29,670 --> 02:11:34,729
Yeah, yeah. All I know how to do is have a number to stop.

667
02:11:34,729 --> 02:11:37,850
Bill Gates figured out Y2K because then we would have gone back in time

668
02:11:38,489 --> 02:11:45,109
like minus 50,000 years if he didn't figure that out.

669
02:11:45,109 --> 02:11:51,500
So are you saying that if I let this run, then this is debt that is removed?

670
02:11:52,439 --> 02:11:56,779
Because I'm removing debt now.

671
02:11:57,829 --> 02:11:58,390
Well, you know-

672
02:11:58,390 --> 02:12:08,329
Is debt being added? Right. Okay. That makes complete sense.

673
02:12:08,329 --> 02:12:10,170
Thank you, Saw. This was a lot of fun.

674
02:12:11,130 --> 02:12:12,090
What's happening?

675
02:12:13,619 --> 02:12:16,579
Why is it taking up? I kind of want to leave this.

676
02:12:20,460 --> 02:12:23,020
What happens when it gets to like a hundred million?

677
02:12:25,560 --> 02:12:26,920
Is my computer going to crash?

678
02:12:30,869 --> 02:12:34,439
Just put it in the corner.

679
02:12:34,439 --> 02:12:38,119
All right. I was going to put this in the corner, but I'm going to put the music.

680
02:12:38,119 --> 02:12:40,039
I can't just have the music going.

681
02:12:40,760 --> 02:12:43,060
I have to mute the website.

682
02:12:46,170 --> 02:12:47,130
Gash, we'll fill the room.

683
02:12:48,649 --> 02:12:49,529
Let me mute this.

684
02:12:54,199 --> 02:12:57,750
Okay. I'm curious to see what happens to this.

685
02:13:01,319 --> 02:13:02,600
All right. Hold on. Let me make sure I could-

686
02:13:08,420 --> 02:13:09,619
Okay. This is good.

687
02:13:22,949 --> 02:13:24,069
I'm not going to turn this off.

688
02:13:25,460 --> 02:13:28,659
I'm not turning this off, by the way, until the stream turns off.

689
02:13:28,659 --> 02:13:29,859
Just to make sure everybody knows that.

690
02:13:31,260 --> 02:13:32,380
Although maybe I should just-

691
02:13:32,380 --> 02:13:33,420
Maybe we'll check on it every-

692
02:13:33,420 --> 02:13:34,859
I don't want that just to be counting the whole time.

693
02:13:36,840 --> 02:13:38,840
We're going to check on this every so often.

694
02:13:38,840 --> 02:13:43,350
We'll give it a good look every so often. Okay?

695
02:13:49,930 --> 02:13:50,890
Yeah. We'll give it a look.

696
02:13:51,449 --> 02:13:53,130
I can just open it like that. Yeah. We're good.

697
02:13:54,060 --> 02:13:54,619
Keep it there.

698
02:13:54,619 --> 02:13:56,140
No, I don't want to like ruin-

699
02:13:56,140 --> 02:13:59,899
I don't want to ruin the entire like VOD or the editing that the editors-

700
02:14:00,460 --> 02:14:02,859
No. That can't just sit there the whole time.

701
02:14:02,859 --> 02:14:13,020
You know how many people are going to ask a question about that on this stream?

702
02:14:13,020 --> 02:14:16,220
Hey, why does this dude have just a negative counter going?

703
02:14:16,779 --> 02:14:21,239
And we have to explain it to them every time.

704
02:14:21,239 --> 02:14:22,840
All right. I'm going to leave it there until a million.

705
02:14:22,840 --> 02:14:24,199
We'll see what happens at one million.

706
02:14:33,060 --> 02:14:35,380
There it is. Why does this dude have a negative counter?

707
02:14:35,380 --> 02:14:36,899
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

708
02:14:36,899 --> 02:14:38,920
All right. Let's go.

709
02:14:42,920 --> 02:14:44,119
Gash, we'll fill the room. Gash.

710
02:14:44,680 --> 02:14:51,380
All right. Now I'm going to go to bed so I can get up in the morning and-

711
02:14:54,729 --> 02:14:56,010
Whoa. Good.

712
02:14:56,729 --> 02:14:59,529
Stop doing that. Stop doing that. Stop doing that.

713
02:14:59,529 --> 02:15:01,289
I'm 35. You can't act like that.

714
02:15:02,489 --> 02:15:05,050
Okay. Your volume.

715
02:15:05,050 --> 02:15:10,779
Ooh. Here we go.

716
02:15:10,779 --> 02:15:20,760
Okay. I'm going to go to sleep.

717
02:15:20,760 --> 02:15:26,699
The best part about that- I love this clip that like- not clip, this site.

718
02:15:26,699 --> 02:15:30,939
Because it was- whoever made that, you are the- I love you.

719
02:15:30,939 --> 02:15:32,220
You are fucking incredible.

720
02:15:32,220 --> 02:15:35,420
Because you just assumed that I had a Rubik's Cube on my desk.

721
02:15:38,489 --> 02:15:39,449
That's so funny.

722
02:15:42,069 --> 02:15:47,479
The counter just starts going.

723
02:15:48,359 --> 02:15:52,680
Let me tell you right now, I would not have been able to do it in that amount of time.

724
02:15:52,680 --> 02:15:54,760
It would probably take me a few days to do a Rubik's Cube.

725
02:15:54,760 --> 02:15:56,600
And that's really embarrassing to say, but it's the truth.

726
02:15:58,010 --> 02:16:01,050
I would do it a little bit, get frustrated, and then stop.

727
02:16:01,939 --> 02:16:03,460
And then a day later, pick it up.

728
02:16:03,460 --> 02:16:11,260
That's a potential week or two long project.

729
02:16:11,899 --> 02:16:12,939
All right. Let's do the stock market.

730
02:16:16,710 --> 02:16:17,829
It went down even more.

731
02:16:21,609 --> 02:16:26,470
I need money. I don't care.

732
02:16:27,189 --> 02:16:31,939
I need the money. I need the upgrade.

733
02:16:40,809 --> 02:16:41,930
Hold it. Hold. No.

734
02:16:42,649 --> 02:16:43,530
I'm not going to hold it.

735
02:16:44,170 --> 02:16:53,100
Oh, what am I doing? Just hit button.

736
02:16:54,180 --> 02:16:55,139
Oh, strawberries. Nice.

737
02:16:55,860 --> 02:16:57,219
I might actually be able to do this right now.

738
02:16:57,780 --> 02:16:58,739
I got five. I can do it.

739
02:16:59,379 --> 02:17:00,819
Holy shit. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Get this right.

740
02:17:01,540 --> 02:17:04,680
This is so many cubits. This is insane.

741
02:17:06,870 --> 02:17:08,069
15 cubits. Nice.

742
02:17:08,069 --> 02:17:08,790
All right. Hold on.

743
02:17:12,459 --> 02:17:13,260
Four. I need a little bit.

744
02:17:13,260 --> 02:17:15,739
Oh, that's good. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

745
02:17:17,059 --> 02:17:17,940
I need some more bugs.

746
02:17:18,500 --> 02:17:28,899
Cool. Nice.

747
02:17:28,899 --> 02:17:30,739
All right. All right. All right. All right. Store these.

748
02:17:30,739 --> 02:17:36,709
All the chickens are doing.

749
02:17:37,190 --> 02:17:39,379
Oh, they grew up. Nice.

750
02:17:39,379 --> 02:17:45,530
All right. I need a rooster and a couple more fruits.

751
02:17:46,170 --> 02:17:48,250
So we're going to rooster run.

752
02:17:48,250 --> 02:17:49,450
All right. I got four minutes to do this.

753
02:17:49,450 --> 02:17:50,250
I just need some bugs.

754
02:17:55,020 --> 02:17:57,180
This tree up here, I know for a fact has them.

755
02:17:57,180 --> 02:18:00,840
I know for a fact.

756
02:18:05,770 --> 02:18:12,299
Chickens. Cool. Cool.

757
02:18:12,299 --> 02:18:14,860
Another chicken. Cool. Chicken. Cool.

758
02:18:18,059 --> 02:18:19,180
Hey, Lenny the person.

759
02:18:19,180 --> 02:18:21,579
Thanks for the 20 community subs.

760
02:18:28,100 --> 02:18:28,819
Right there. There we are.

761
02:18:31,690 --> 02:18:32,329
Fly up there.

762
02:18:32,969 --> 02:18:35,180
I'm running out.

763
02:18:35,819 --> 02:18:41,260
Check in. Give me these.

764
02:18:41,979 --> 02:18:42,860
Touch these. Get away from this.

765
02:18:44,700 --> 02:18:45,579
That should be enough.

766
02:18:45,579 --> 02:18:50,389
All right. Get out. Coffee.

767
02:18:50,389 --> 02:18:56,500
Oh, coffee. Coffee. Coffee.

768
02:18:57,139 --> 02:18:59,610
I'll do it. I'll do the line.

769
02:18:59,610 --> 02:19:00,969
Fine. I'll do it. I'll do it. I'll do it.

770
02:19:02,250 --> 02:19:04,250
Coffee, Cheetos, and chicken.

771
02:19:04,889 --> 02:19:06,899
There you go. He did it.

772
02:19:06,899 --> 02:19:08,420
I'll do it again. I'll do it authentic.

773
02:19:09,770 --> 02:19:11,290
Coffee, Cheetos, and chicken.

774
02:19:12,010 --> 02:19:12,409
There you go.

775
02:19:12,409 --> 02:19:14,170
That's exactly how everybody wanted me to say that.

776
02:19:16,360 --> 02:19:17,159
I get a rooster for this.

777
02:19:21,180 --> 02:19:24,180
I didn't do it right. I didn't do it right.

778
02:19:24,739 --> 02:19:29,879
There you go.

779
02:19:32,020 --> 02:19:36,540
I'll get a rooster in there.

780
02:19:37,989 --> 02:19:40,069
Now we're going to have eggs.

781
02:19:40,790 --> 02:19:43,180
Very nice.

782
02:19:44,629 --> 02:19:45,430
Oh, was that an egg?

783
02:19:47,370 --> 02:19:51,000
No. Awesome.

784
02:19:51,000 --> 02:19:52,120
Now I have plenty of chickens.

785
02:19:52,680 --> 02:19:55,020
I'll upgrade this a little more.

786
02:19:55,020 --> 02:19:55,739
I got 1,200 bucks.

787
02:19:55,739 --> 02:19:58,540
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

788
02:19:58,540 --> 02:19:59,739
Everybody's hungry.

789
02:20:00,540 --> 02:20:01,860
All right. I'm going to relax.

790
02:20:01,860 --> 02:20:02,360
Settle down.

791
02:20:03,379 --> 02:20:04,180
Feed.

792
02:20:04,180 --> 02:20:04,739
Let's feed them.

793
02:20:05,459 --> 02:20:07,319
Nope. We got much better than PogFruit.

794
02:20:07,319 --> 02:20:08,040
Whatever.

795
02:20:08,040 --> 02:20:10,409
I'll just use it.

796
02:20:20,649 --> 02:20:21,770
Now we're cooking Pogash.

797
02:20:26,629 --> 02:20:27,110
Suck it up.

798
02:20:28,940 --> 02:20:30,860
I need a sucker on here.

799
02:20:31,739 --> 02:20:33,500
I'm getting real sick of having to do that.

800
02:20:33,500 --> 02:20:34,780
Even if it's 500 bucks, I don't care.

801
02:20:35,340 --> 02:20:36,459
I want a sucker on this one.

802
02:20:37,340 --> 02:20:51,190
What do we got?

803
02:20:51,190 --> 02:20:52,229
Four and six.

804
02:20:52,229 --> 02:20:53,190
Do it again.

805
02:20:53,190 --> 02:20:53,670
Suck it up.

806
02:20:57,020 --> 02:21:00,149
Hey, eat one of these.

807
02:21:03,459 --> 02:21:05,780
Doi, doi, doi, doi, doi, doi, doi, doi.

808
02:21:06,579 --> 02:21:09,530
Thanks for the doi.

809
02:21:13,930 --> 02:21:16,059
All right.

810
02:21:16,059 --> 02:21:17,180
Prices are still down.

811
02:21:20,020 --> 02:21:20,899
I'm for upgrades.

812
02:21:21,540 --> 02:21:26,329
Upgrade.

813
02:21:26,329 --> 02:21:27,059
304.

814
02:21:27,059 --> 02:21:28,180
I sort of held on to the gold.

815
02:21:31,020 --> 02:21:32,219
It's a million.

816
02:21:32,219 --> 02:21:32,540
Oh, yeah.

817
02:21:32,540 --> 02:21:33,180
That's still there.

818
02:21:42,170 --> 02:21:42,409
Okay.

819
02:21:42,409 --> 02:21:43,370
Let me take out.

820
02:21:43,370 --> 02:21:44,090
No, I'll leave that in.

821
02:21:44,979 --> 02:21:46,420
What can I do here for the chickens?

822
02:21:47,450 --> 02:21:48,409
Spring grass.

823
02:21:48,409 --> 02:21:49,209
Vitamizer.

824
02:21:51,020 --> 02:21:52,860
Vitamizer bathes the chickens in vital rays,

825
02:21:52,860 --> 02:21:55,260
allowing them to grow into healthy hens and roosters twice as fast.

826
02:21:56,299 --> 02:21:58,620
Spring grass attracts scuttle bugs that they eat.

827
02:21:59,340 --> 02:22:01,020
They'll produce eggs twice as fast.

828
02:22:01,020 --> 02:22:01,899
So we want the grass.

829
02:22:02,700 --> 02:22:03,819
Get them both.

830
02:22:04,379 --> 02:22:06,250
Let's go.

831
02:22:08,819 --> 02:22:09,299
Okay.

832
02:22:09,299 --> 02:22:13,209
So now, this is a pretty good, this is going pretty good.

833
02:22:13,209 --> 02:22:16,170
Now I'm going to take like seven of them to feed to the big cat.

834
02:22:19,209 --> 02:22:25,139
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

835
02:22:25,139 --> 02:22:26,819
Grass, grass.

836
02:22:26,819 --> 02:22:31,559
When did this game come out?

837
02:22:31,559 --> 02:22:32,040
What year?

838
02:22:36,729 --> 02:22:37,690
What year did this game come out?

839
02:22:42,840 --> 02:22:45,159
2000, 2017.

840
02:22:46,520 --> 02:22:46,760
Okay.

841
02:22:47,639 --> 02:22:48,360
2017.

842
02:22:49,159 --> 02:22:51,979
What was my game of the year in 2017?

843
02:22:51,979 --> 02:22:52,620
Can I amend it?

844
02:22:54,579 --> 02:22:55,860
What was my game of the year 2017?

845
02:22:55,860 --> 02:22:56,260
Anyone know?

846
02:23:02,329 --> 02:23:02,969
2016.

847
02:23:02,969 --> 02:23:04,409
Well, what was my game of the year 2016?

848
02:23:05,719 --> 02:23:06,280
I don't know.

849
02:23:06,840 --> 02:23:13,959
It was Sorcery.

850
02:23:16,739 --> 02:23:17,860
It was The Witcher 3.

851
02:23:17,860 --> 02:23:18,340
Oh, yeah.

852
02:23:18,340 --> 02:23:19,219
Was that 2015?

853
02:23:19,219 --> 02:23:20,340
No, that's 2015.

854
02:23:26,100 --> 02:23:27,620
All out for Omega Low.

855
02:23:27,620 --> 02:23:28,899
Now, that's a huge Omega Low.

856
02:23:28,899 --> 02:23:31,620
That's like a mega Omega Low.

857
02:23:31,620 --> 02:23:33,620
That's the biggest Omega Low I've ever heard in my life.

858
02:23:34,420 --> 02:23:35,639
All right.

859
02:23:35,639 --> 02:23:36,360
I'm taking some of you.

860
02:23:37,000 --> 02:23:43,479
All right.

861
02:23:43,479 --> 02:23:45,879
I'm going to, I'm taking this big supply.

862
02:23:45,879 --> 02:23:46,840
We're going to go feed the big guy.

863
02:23:47,559 --> 02:23:48,600
And I'm going to get a quashed.

864
02:23:49,530 --> 02:23:51,850
I need these plorts, post-haste, whatever that means.

865
02:23:53,739 --> 02:23:56,219
Oh, oh, that's, holy shit.

866
02:23:56,219 --> 02:23:57,420
This is a rip off for you.

867
02:23:57,979 --> 02:23:59,739
This is the, what a rip off.

868
02:23:59,739 --> 02:24:00,540
This is the easy.

869
02:24:00,540 --> 02:24:01,340
Oh, my God.

870
02:24:01,340 --> 02:24:02,379
That's the simplest thing ever.

871
02:24:02,379 --> 02:24:02,860
Okay.

872
02:24:02,860 --> 02:24:10,540
What about, how many do I need?

873
02:24:10,540 --> 02:24:14,819
I need just pink and I have those already.

874
02:24:14,819 --> 02:24:16,659
Let's scam this person.

875
02:24:31,770 --> 02:24:32,170
Okay.

876
02:24:32,170 --> 02:24:41,909
Now, let's get pink plorts back in there.

877
02:25:04,360 --> 02:25:05,159
Okay.

878
02:25:05,799 --> 02:25:06,600
I have enough.

879
02:25:06,600 --> 02:25:07,879
That was the easiest.

880
02:25:07,879 --> 02:25:08,840
A huge amount of money.

881
02:25:09,399 --> 02:25:10,680
It was very simple.

882
02:25:10,680 --> 02:25:11,559
I didn't have to do anything.

883
02:25:13,639 --> 02:25:14,729
Perfect.

884
02:25:14,729 --> 02:25:21,110
Plorts, plorts.

885
02:25:21,110 --> 02:25:21,350
Okay.

886
02:25:22,069 --> 02:25:23,620
And what do I get for this?

887
02:25:23,620 --> 02:25:23,940
All right.

888
02:25:23,940 --> 02:25:24,979
I got to clear my inventory.

889
02:25:26,180 --> 02:25:26,979
Eat some of these beats.

890
02:25:27,620 --> 02:25:28,739
Just leave them in there.

891
02:25:28,739 --> 02:25:29,860
You guys will be hungry eventually.

892
02:25:29,860 --> 02:25:30,360
Okay.

893
02:25:32,409 --> 02:25:34,700
Give me these.

894
02:25:34,700 --> 02:25:40,629
Okay.

895
02:25:40,629 --> 02:25:42,360
Cool.

896
02:25:42,360 --> 02:25:43,239
Sell a bunch of shit.

897
02:25:45,989 --> 02:25:47,430
Prices, still bad.

898
02:25:48,069 --> 02:25:57,620
Give it to me.

899
02:26:04,200 --> 02:26:06,040
Oh, I love just vacuuming everything.

900
02:26:06,680 --> 02:26:08,440
This is the best game ever.

901
02:26:09,000 --> 02:26:10,520
This might be the best game ever.

902
02:26:11,159 --> 02:26:14,409
I know that a lot of you have, you know,

903
02:26:14,409 --> 02:26:17,850
like Mario Galaxy is like your number one game ever made.

904
02:26:19,030 --> 02:26:19,750
No, not it.

905
02:26:19,750 --> 02:26:20,229
No, it's not.

906
02:26:20,229 --> 02:26:20,950
It's this one.

907
02:26:20,950 --> 02:26:21,829
This is the one.

908
02:26:21,829 --> 02:26:22,469
It's this game.

909
02:26:23,270 --> 02:26:24,329
Okay.

910
02:26:26,389 --> 02:26:27,670
Now, I look at all these pens.

911
02:26:35,059 --> 02:26:35,700
Wow.

912
02:26:35,700 --> 02:26:36,420
Perfect.

913
02:26:36,420 --> 02:26:38,340
Sell the rest of these.

914
02:26:38,979 --> 02:26:40,020
Get another quest too.

915
02:26:40,020 --> 02:26:40,500
Why not?

916
02:26:41,700 --> 02:26:45,979
Henry, I think you like this game too much.

917
02:26:57,159 --> 02:26:57,479
All right.

918
02:26:58,120 --> 02:26:59,399
That's good.

919
02:27:00,760 --> 02:27:01,479
Sell the plorts.

920
02:27:02,200 --> 02:27:05,530
Fuck Mario and his dumb mustache.

921
02:27:05,530 --> 02:27:06,250
I didn't say that.

922
02:27:06,250 --> 02:27:06,889
That's me.

923
02:27:08,649 --> 02:27:11,719
Feed the big guy.

924
02:27:12,360 --> 02:27:15,190
I don't think he has a dumb mustache.

925
02:27:15,190 --> 02:27:16,149
I think Mario looks good.

926
02:27:16,870 --> 02:27:17,270
Wait.

927
02:27:17,270 --> 02:27:17,770
Upgrade.

928
02:27:29,030 --> 02:27:29,590
Dash boots.

929
02:27:30,229 --> 02:27:34,340
Power core or no, something else.

930
02:27:34,979 --> 02:27:35,700
What can I do with this?

931
02:27:36,340 --> 02:27:36,979
Solar shield.

932
02:27:36,979 --> 02:27:37,780
Auto feeder.

933
02:27:41,319 --> 02:27:42,040
Music box.

934
02:27:46,809 --> 02:27:47,530
Music box.

935
02:27:49,299 --> 02:27:49,860
Air net.

936
02:27:56,180 --> 02:27:56,899
Or a new area.

937
02:27:56,899 --> 02:27:57,139
Yeah.

938
02:27:57,139 --> 02:27:58,340
Maybe I'll save it for the new area.

939
02:28:01,670 --> 02:28:02,389
Yeah, I'm going to hold it.

940
02:28:02,389 --> 02:28:02,629
All right.

941
02:28:02,629 --> 02:28:03,510
I'm going to go feed the big guy.

942
02:28:11,590 --> 02:28:12,149
All right.

943
02:28:12,950 --> 02:28:15,350
I turn off this 1.7 million.

944
02:28:17,610 --> 02:28:19,049
We'll check back on it later.

945
02:28:19,049 --> 02:28:19,930
It's distracting.

946
02:28:33,209 --> 02:28:37,639
I can't believe I found a golden at the very beginning.

947
02:28:42,569 --> 02:28:43,370
Oh, I just fed them.

948
02:28:56,520 --> 02:28:57,399
Oh, a cat.

949
02:28:57,399 --> 02:28:58,040
All right.

950
02:28:58,040 --> 02:28:58,760
And over here.

951
02:29:00,149 --> 02:29:01,350
So what does this do for me?

952
02:29:01,350 --> 02:29:01,750
Here we go.

953
02:29:01,750 --> 02:29:02,069
Ready.

954
02:29:02,629 --> 02:29:02,950
Feed.

955
02:29:03,510 --> 02:29:04,229
Feed.

956
02:29:04,229 --> 02:29:04,870
Feed him.

957
02:29:04,870 --> 02:29:05,350
Feed him.

958
02:29:05,350 --> 02:29:05,829
Feed him.

959
02:29:05,829 --> 02:29:06,629
Feed him.

960
02:29:06,629 --> 02:29:07,030
Feed him.

961
02:29:09,180 --> 02:29:10,219
You want more?

962
02:29:12,600 --> 02:29:13,479
More than seven?

963
02:29:18,659 --> 02:29:19,139
Jesus.

964
02:29:19,780 --> 02:29:24,459
You did like 30.

965
02:29:26,200 --> 02:29:26,600
30?

966
02:29:52,469 --> 02:29:58,329
Well, I guess I can't do it.

967
02:29:58,329 --> 02:30:02,120
Save this.

968
02:30:02,120 --> 02:30:03,559
Yeah, I was going to bring the stony back.

969
02:30:03,559 --> 02:30:07,780
And I'm going to take another quest.

970
02:30:07,780 --> 02:30:10,870
Yeah, try that again.

971
02:30:11,510 --> 02:30:12,950
See what happens.

972
02:30:22,059 --> 02:30:23,500
Sell, sell, sell, sell.

973
02:30:23,500 --> 02:30:24,700
Money, money, money, money.

974
02:30:30,729 --> 02:30:31,530
Money.

975
02:30:31,530 --> 02:30:32,649
I'll take money.

976
02:30:33,450 --> 02:30:36,309
Thanks for the money.

977
02:30:36,309 --> 02:30:43,799
This dude is so greedy.

978
02:30:43,799 --> 02:30:45,000
Yes, I am.

979
02:30:46,260 --> 02:30:47,059
Get over it.

980
02:30:47,059 --> 02:30:56,389
Come on.

981
02:30:56,389 --> 02:30:57,430
I want more.

982
02:30:57,430 --> 02:30:59,879
I'm not satisfied with the amount of money that I'm going to bring back.

983
02:30:59,879 --> 02:31:00,040
All right.

984
02:31:00,040 --> 02:31:00,280
Fine.

985
02:31:00,280 --> 02:31:11,799
Goodbye.

986
02:31:11,799 --> 02:31:13,159
The greedy grinner.

987
02:31:13,159 --> 02:31:20,870
Anything else?

988
02:31:20,870 --> 02:31:21,590
See ya.

989
02:31:22,790 --> 02:31:23,430
I'll take it.

990
02:31:24,729 --> 02:31:25,450
I'll take it.

991
02:31:26,420 --> 02:31:26,739
Okay.

992
02:31:31,500 --> 02:31:32,780
You unhinged?

993
02:31:32,780 --> 02:31:34,299
Are you asking me or did you say I was?

994
02:31:41,620 --> 02:31:42,739
Hey, dude, you unhinged?

995
02:31:44,329 --> 02:31:46,709
Yeah, I think so.

996
02:31:46,709 --> 02:31:47,209
Hello.

997
02:32:00,819 --> 02:32:02,489
Press Q.

998
02:32:02,489 --> 02:32:03,049
He didn't do anything.

999
02:32:03,049 --> 02:32:04,809
We just crossed two million, by the way.

1000
02:32:05,670 --> 02:32:10,680
Negative two million.

1001
02:32:10,680 --> 02:32:11,959
There are a lot of people in here now.

1002
02:32:13,799 --> 02:32:14,760
It's clucking away.

1003
02:32:15,399 --> 02:32:20,520
No more quests.

1004
02:32:20,520 --> 02:32:21,079
Time to sell.

1005
02:32:21,079 --> 02:32:21,879
Actually, I'm going to sleep.

1006
02:32:22,520 --> 02:32:24,139
Maybe the market will be better in the morning.

1007
02:32:25,590 --> 02:32:26,950
I'm going to wake up to a better market.

1008
02:32:27,750 --> 02:32:36,409
That's as much as I can get it.

1009
02:32:36,969 --> 02:32:44,440
Well, it seems like another wannabe rancher

1010
02:32:44,440 --> 02:32:46,680
has signed up for a lonely existence on a faraway space route.

1011
02:32:46,680 --> 02:32:48,280
Congrats, Beatrix.

1012
02:32:49,159 --> 02:32:50,760
I'm Mochi Miles.

1013
02:32:50,760 --> 02:32:53,559
That's Miles as in Tatsuya Miles, the billionaire.

1014
02:32:53,559 --> 02:32:55,899
I'm going to do important business for my dad,

1015
02:32:55,899 --> 02:32:59,180
but that doesn't mean I won't make all the rest of these backwater types out here

1016
02:32:59,180 --> 02:33:00,950
look bad in the process.

1017
02:33:00,950 --> 02:33:04,950
No one conquers the plort market like I do day in and day out.

1018
02:33:04,950 --> 02:33:06,709
My dad gives me the inside track,

1019
02:33:06,709 --> 02:33:08,950
so I look forward to my requesting plorts

1020
02:33:08,950 --> 02:33:11,350
that I know will make me huge profits later on.

1021
02:33:11,350 --> 02:33:13,510
So I wish you the best of luck, Beatrix,

1022
02:33:13,510 --> 02:33:16,069
and maybe you'll even reach second place one day.

1023
02:33:16,069 --> 02:33:17,989
At the very least, you can tell your friends

1024
02:33:17,989 --> 02:33:20,309
that you helped out the great Mochi Miles

1025
02:33:20,309 --> 02:33:22,709
in her conquest of the far, far range.

1026
02:33:22,709 --> 02:33:23,829
Later, Tater.

1027
02:33:23,829 --> 02:33:25,190
Mochi Miles, top rancher.

1028
02:33:25,190 --> 02:33:34,010
No, go to sleep.

1029
02:33:34,010 --> 02:33:44,440
Hank Booster MK2.

1030
02:33:44,440 --> 02:34:01,299
Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1031
02:34:01,299 --> 02:34:20,840
Market done.

1032
02:34:20,840 --> 02:34:21,879
You keep selling.

1033
02:34:23,829 --> 02:34:26,309
Yeah, because it's fucking money.

1034
02:34:26,309 --> 02:34:28,809
I need some more chickens to feed to the big guy,

1035
02:34:28,809 --> 02:34:30,409
not the snowy one, because that's a rare one.

1036
02:34:30,409 --> 02:34:31,290
I want that one.

1037
02:34:31,290 --> 02:34:38,280
Are we supposed to wipe out this entire group?

1038
02:34:41,219 --> 02:34:42,100
I have 14.

1039
02:34:42,100 --> 02:34:44,420
All right, 15 hens.

1040
02:34:44,420 --> 02:34:45,459
Is that not going to be enough?

1041
02:34:54,860 --> 02:34:55,819
Oh, they're really hungry.

1042
02:34:55,819 --> 02:34:56,299
All right, hold on.

1043
02:34:56,299 --> 02:34:56,860
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1044
02:34:56,860 --> 02:34:57,739
You're good, you're good, you're good, you're good.

1045
02:34:57,739 --> 02:34:58,860
Stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay.

1046
02:35:03,129 --> 02:35:04,170
Get back in there.

1047
02:35:04,170 --> 02:35:04,670
Hey!

1048
02:35:05,209 --> 02:35:05,709
Hey!

1049
02:35:21,020 --> 02:35:23,020
All right, I'm going to feed them Qberries.

1050
02:35:23,020 --> 02:35:24,459
That's a high quality food, right?

1051
02:35:25,420 --> 02:35:28,229
All right, you guys want Qberries?

1052
02:35:28,870 --> 02:35:29,989
We love Qberries.

1053
02:35:39,739 --> 02:35:40,239
Eat up.

1054
02:35:44,329 --> 02:35:44,829
Eat up.

1055
02:35:48,200 --> 02:35:50,760
Ooh, the Qberries are a pretty good food, aren't they?

1056
02:35:51,479 --> 02:36:00,620
Poison the water.

1057
02:36:00,620 --> 02:36:02,540
I'm going to relax, dude.

1058
02:36:03,260 --> 02:36:08,780
I'm going to have to put a ceiling on.

1059
02:36:09,739 --> 02:36:10,379
Ow, hey.

1060
02:36:11,770 --> 02:36:12,809
I'm about to throw them over the edge.

1061
02:36:19,770 --> 02:36:20,569
Nice.

1062
02:36:20,569 --> 02:36:21,209
Look at all that.

1063
02:36:22,950 --> 02:36:23,590
So much money.

1064
02:36:24,229 --> 02:36:26,860
A roof on the corral.

1065
02:36:26,860 --> 02:36:27,420
Yeah, I'm going to.

1066
02:36:28,969 --> 02:36:29,690
Roof going on.

1067
02:36:31,700 --> 02:36:33,059
I want an air net.

1068
02:36:34,920 --> 02:36:36,040
Now you can't get out.

1069
02:36:36,600 --> 02:36:38,229
Stay in there.

1070
02:36:39,219 --> 02:36:40,100
Oh, come on, really?

1071
02:36:40,100 --> 02:36:40,899
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1072
02:36:40,899 --> 02:36:41,399
Come here.

1073
02:36:54,549 --> 02:36:55,270
Then kill them.

1074
02:36:58,379 --> 02:36:59,100
Come over there.

1075
02:36:59,100 --> 02:37:00,540
Put his head in there.

1076
02:37:00,540 --> 02:37:02,620
I said, then kill him.

1077
02:37:02,620 --> 02:37:03,180
What's that from?

1078
02:37:05,340 --> 02:37:06,139
Take over there.

1079
02:37:06,139 --> 02:37:07,739
Punch him in the face and then kill him.

1080
02:37:08,299 --> 02:37:09,260
What's it from?

1081
02:37:09,260 --> 02:37:12,200
What is that from?

1082
02:37:19,110 --> 02:37:22,870
Um, no, that's uh, that's Who Framed Roger Rabbit.

1083
02:37:26,090 --> 02:37:26,729
That's the judge.

1084
02:37:28,149 --> 02:37:29,190
He says like, something, something, something.

1085
02:37:29,190 --> 02:37:30,629
Take over there and then kill him.

1086
02:37:31,270 --> 02:37:41,579
If you say so.

1087
02:37:41,579 --> 02:37:42,299
No, I know so.

1088
02:37:42,860 --> 02:37:52,340
I want to sell these when the rock plots are higher, but whatever.

1089
02:37:55,430 --> 02:37:56,709
Want to upgrade now.

1090
02:37:57,350 --> 02:38:00,090
Put them in the dip.

1091
02:38:00,090 --> 02:38:01,129
Not the dip.

1092
02:38:02,440 --> 02:38:04,440
We can't go into that dip.

1093
02:38:04,440 --> 02:38:05,079
No.

1094
02:38:05,079 --> 02:38:08,739
Take him over to the dip.

1095
02:38:08,739 --> 02:38:10,739
Jump his head in and dunk his head over there and kill him.

1096
02:38:11,540 --> 02:38:12,040
Yeah.

1097
02:38:28,280 --> 02:38:29,159
No, dammit.

1098
02:38:31,190 --> 02:38:32,549
If you get out, you're dead.

1099
02:38:32,549 --> 02:38:33,030
He got out.

1100
02:38:33,030 --> 02:38:33,909
He's dead.

1101
02:38:33,909 --> 02:38:34,790
Just kidding.

1102
02:38:34,790 --> 02:38:42,069
Everyone's eating.

1103
02:38:42,069 --> 02:38:42,950
Give me that cubert.

1104
02:38:43,670 --> 02:38:47,670
Let's just suck up one more time.

1105
02:38:47,670 --> 02:38:48,870
Make sure we didn't leave anything.

1106
02:38:50,899 --> 02:38:51,540
Cool.

1107
02:38:51,540 --> 02:38:53,700
Put the kiwberries away.

1108
02:38:57,670 --> 02:38:59,590
I hope German doesn't actually buy stocks.

1109
02:38:59,590 --> 02:39:00,950
He would actually be a million in debt.

1110
02:39:01,590 --> 02:39:02,790
You don't know anything about me.

1111
02:39:03,430 --> 02:39:14,010
How many can I store?

1112
02:39:31,129 --> 02:39:32,010
You don't make a low.

1113
02:39:34,979 --> 02:39:35,700
Take him over there.

1114
02:39:37,700 --> 02:39:39,540
Stick a shoe on his head and then kill him.

1115
02:39:40,180 --> 02:39:43,899
I'm thinking good.

1116
02:39:43,899 --> 02:39:44,940
Yeah, let's go feed the big guy.

1117
02:39:45,500 --> 02:39:53,639
No, no, I'm not talking about that part.

1118
02:39:53,639 --> 02:39:55,000
I'm talking, I'm just like, I'm doing it.

1119
02:39:55,000 --> 02:39:55,879
It's in my head right now.

1120
02:39:57,079 --> 02:39:59,799
That was a weird transition, but no, that's not what I was trying to say.

1121
02:39:59,799 --> 02:40:00,299
Chicken.

1122
02:40:00,780 --> 02:40:04,879
Press Q, please.

1123
02:40:08,940 --> 02:40:09,739
What does Q do?

1124
02:40:26,959 --> 02:40:27,459
Chicken.

1125
02:40:27,920 --> 02:40:31,290
Chicken.

1126
02:40:31,290 --> 02:40:35,159
Oh, you just, I just got, I just booped.

1127
02:40:35,159 --> 02:40:35,879
He went like boop.

1128
02:40:38,829 --> 02:40:41,319
My god, I got booped.

1129
02:40:41,319 --> 02:40:41,819
Boop.

1130
02:40:42,680 --> 02:40:48,520
I have 21 chickens.

1131
02:40:48,520 --> 02:40:49,079
This isn't going to work.

1132
02:40:49,719 --> 02:40:55,370
If you need to eat more than 30 chickens, then that's kind of ridiculous.

1133
02:40:58,860 --> 02:40:59,579
Oh, I want you.

1134
02:41:02,479 --> 02:41:04,000
Ooh, multiple stony hens.

1135
02:41:04,000 --> 02:41:04,500
Cool.

1136
02:41:04,959 --> 02:41:09,469
We're safe.

1137
02:41:11,579 --> 02:41:12,620
Shut the fuck up.

1138
02:41:18,280 --> 02:41:20,760
Oh my god, you absolute unit.

1139
02:41:25,340 --> 02:41:25,840
What?

1140
02:41:28,680 --> 02:41:29,180
Cat puke.

1141
02:41:34,270 --> 02:41:34,770
It was.

1142
02:41:35,469 --> 02:41:36,750
It was a cat puke.

1143
02:41:36,750 --> 02:41:37,250
It was.

1144
02:41:40,799 --> 02:41:41,600
Get away from me.

1145
02:41:51,049 --> 02:41:53,049
I can't believe I have to keep, why?

1146
02:41:53,049 --> 02:41:53,770
What the fuck?

1147
02:41:54,489 --> 02:41:55,690
Stop turning into these guys.

1148
02:41:57,450 --> 02:41:58,329
We're being overrun.

1149
02:41:59,469 --> 02:42:00,190
We're overrun.

1150
02:42:00,829 --> 02:42:15,850
Oh, it's a stony chick.

1151
02:42:15,850 --> 02:42:17,370
FPS shooter voice.

1152
02:42:19,879 --> 02:42:20,440
Watch your tail.

1153
02:42:23,040 --> 02:42:24,479
Being overrun over here.

1154
02:42:24,479 --> 02:42:38,079
What was that?

1155
02:42:44,909 --> 02:42:46,590
Oh, and that's the division voice.

1156
02:42:54,750 --> 02:42:55,629
The division.

1157
02:43:08,920 --> 02:43:09,719
All right.

1158
02:43:09,719 --> 02:43:14,090
Stony hens, stony hens, stony chick, chick, chick, chick, stony chick.

1159
02:43:14,090 --> 02:43:28,590
Why are they still going down on value?

1160
02:43:28,590 --> 02:43:30,190
Am I actually flooding the market?

1161
02:43:30,190 --> 02:43:32,090
All right, I'm back.

1162
02:43:32,090 --> 02:43:34,170
I'm here and I've got a thing for you guys.

1163
02:43:34,889 --> 02:43:35,790
How did you get out?

1164
02:43:36,430 --> 02:43:38,190
I need to put a roof on that one too.

1165
02:43:38,989 --> 02:43:47,000
Oh, I got you.

1166
02:43:47,000 --> 02:43:47,319
I got you.

1167
02:43:47,319 --> 02:43:47,639
I got you.

1168
02:43:47,639 --> 02:43:47,959
Don't worry.

1169
02:43:47,959 --> 02:43:48,459
You're okay.

1170
02:43:49,079 --> 02:43:57,850
Okay, now none of you are getting out again.

1171
02:43:59,420 --> 02:44:00,540
Am I like suffocating that one?

1172
02:44:01,180 --> 02:44:11,370
I need music.

1173
02:44:12,010 --> 02:44:16,409
I'll get it when I'm ready.

1174
02:44:22,590 --> 02:44:23,469
Chickens.

1175
02:44:23,469 --> 02:44:24,030
What?

1176
02:44:24,030 --> 02:44:26,000
What about the chickens?

1177
02:44:26,000 --> 02:44:26,319
What happened?

1178
02:44:28,600 --> 02:44:29,559
You little shit.

1179
02:44:30,200 --> 02:44:32,920
No, you're not going over there.

1180
02:44:33,719 --> 02:44:37,129
Stay in here.

1181
02:44:37,129 --> 02:44:37,850
He's just looking at me.

1182
02:44:37,850 --> 02:44:38,969
I'm going to get those chickens.

1183
02:44:38,969 --> 02:44:40,409
I'm going to eat all those chickens.

1184
02:44:41,129 --> 02:44:43,120
You're not touching those chickens.

1185
02:44:43,760 --> 02:44:44,879
You're going to be in big trouble.

1186
02:44:45,520 --> 02:44:48,920
You should be much more prepared at this point in the game.

1187
02:44:48,920 --> 02:44:49,399
You suck.

1188
02:44:56,799 --> 02:44:58,799
Open up the fucking slime rancher Wikipedia page.

1189
02:44:59,520 --> 02:45:00,079
All right, it's okay.

1190
02:45:00,239 --> 02:45:00,799
Let me go.

1191
02:45:00,799 --> 02:45:01,520
How do I put it in?

1192
02:45:01,520 --> 02:45:02,719
Minimum, minimum, maximum of the game.

1193
02:45:03,440 --> 02:45:05,520
Okay, first three hours I've ever played.

1194
02:45:06,489 --> 02:45:06,809
What?

1195
02:45:06,809 --> 02:45:08,170
What should I not do?

1196
02:45:08,170 --> 02:45:09,049
I'm not doing that ever.

1197
02:45:09,610 --> 02:45:12,459
Okay, I'm going to have two of the screens.

1198
02:45:12,459 --> 02:45:13,819
Have that open into furniture and windows.

1199
02:45:14,379 --> 02:45:15,979
What's the maximum thing I gave for that price?

1200
02:45:16,620 --> 02:45:17,180
Do that only.

1201
02:45:17,180 --> 02:45:17,979
Okay, don't do anything else.

1202
02:45:32,239 --> 02:45:33,600
Like, this ain't Dark Souls.

1203
02:45:33,600 --> 02:45:35,040
It's Slime Rancher.

1204
02:45:35,040 --> 02:45:39,159
All right, feed.

1205
02:45:55,629 --> 02:45:56,430
Read the wiki.

1206
02:45:57,309 --> 02:46:01,180
I'm just having fun.

1207
02:46:01,180 --> 02:46:02,379
Like, come on.

1208
02:46:20,479 --> 02:46:21,680
No fun allowed.

1209
02:46:21,680 --> 02:46:22,959
No, don't have any fun.

1210
02:46:34,079 --> 02:46:34,719
Fun?

1211
02:46:34,719 --> 02:46:35,840
This is a lifestyle.

1212
02:46:36,879 --> 02:46:38,559
Yeah, this game's fucking awesome.

1213
02:46:43,840 --> 02:46:44,799
I love it.

1214
02:46:44,799 --> 02:46:45,760
It's so good.

1215
02:46:52,670 --> 02:46:58,030
If I'm not playing, if I'm not doing the best possible route and I'm taking it slow,

1216
02:46:59,149 --> 02:47:00,030
I want to do that.

1217
02:47:00,989 --> 02:47:06,760
I want to just do dumb things like this.

1218
02:47:06,760 --> 02:47:07,639
Because guess what?

1219
02:47:07,639 --> 02:47:11,799
In like six months when I'm the number one slime rancher player on the leaderboards,

1220
02:47:12,360 --> 02:47:16,200
I would like you to come back and then we'll grade your performance in the video game.

1221
02:47:17,000 --> 02:47:23,079
By the way, probably not going to play this for a place like another couple of days ever.

1222
02:47:24,680 --> 02:47:25,239
Hello, Bob.

1223
02:47:25,239 --> 02:47:25,479
Hello.

1224
02:47:25,479 --> 02:47:25,879
Hello.

1225
02:47:25,879 --> 02:47:26,200
Chickens.

1226
02:47:26,200 --> 02:47:26,600
Hello.

1227
02:47:26,600 --> 02:47:26,920
Chickens.

1228
02:47:26,920 --> 02:47:27,239
Chickens.

1229
02:47:27,239 --> 02:47:27,559
P.S.

1230
02:47:27,559 --> 02:47:28,440
Chicken.

1231
02:47:28,440 --> 02:47:39,399
The Z rewards club is that easy.

1232
02:47:39,399 --> 02:47:40,200
Premium price.

1233
02:47:40,200 --> 02:47:42,360
Each rank grants you a new club title.

1234
02:47:42,360 --> 02:47:48,540
Can I sleep?

1235
02:47:48,540 --> 02:47:48,780
Yeah.

1236
02:47:49,819 --> 02:47:50,059
Yep.

1237
02:47:51,340 --> 02:47:56,750
Someone from the chat wrote the chicken email.

1238
02:48:03,930 --> 02:48:04,649
All right, I'm going to go.

1239
02:48:04,649 --> 02:48:07,370
I want to save up for the new area, so I'm going to do a quest.

1240
02:48:12,430 --> 02:48:17,920
I really want to get that just so you can see.

1241
02:48:18,000 --> 02:48:19,600
When it hits a billion, I wonder what's going to happen.

1242
02:48:29,129 --> 02:48:29,530
All right.

1243
02:48:31,520 --> 02:48:32,079
That's fine.

1244
02:48:32,879 --> 02:48:34,379
Everyone's been fed.

1245
02:48:35,100 --> 02:48:37,819
These are just worthless.

1246
02:48:37,819 --> 02:48:38,219
Whatever.

1247
02:48:39,020 --> 02:48:45,629
OK, cool.

1248
02:48:45,629 --> 02:48:46,350
I need what is it?

1249
02:48:46,350 --> 02:48:48,030
1700 to go to the next area.

1250
02:48:52,440 --> 02:48:54,200
This is ranch expansion.

1251
02:48:54,200 --> 02:48:55,959
The grotto is 1795.

1252
02:48:55,959 --> 02:48:56,520
What's the other one?

1253
02:48:57,159 --> 02:49:08,430
I need to go to the grotto or the overgrowth.

1254
02:49:08,430 --> 02:49:09,790
Which one was better?

1255
02:49:10,350 --> 02:49:13,209
I'm sure they're both fun.

1256
02:49:13,209 --> 02:49:15,739
Which one's more grotto?

1257
02:49:16,299 --> 02:49:19,209
Those are extra areas for farming.

1258
02:49:19,209 --> 02:49:19,690
That's cool.

1259
02:49:21,680 --> 02:49:23,200
I personally like the grotto more.

1260
02:49:23,200 --> 02:49:23,440
OK.

1261
02:49:24,000 --> 02:49:25,120
Overgrowth gives food.

1262
02:49:25,760 --> 02:49:27,120
We'll go to grotto.

1263
02:49:27,680 --> 02:49:28,989
Grotto sounds like fun.

1264
02:49:30,590 --> 02:49:31,709
I don't need to do any of that.

1265
02:49:31,709 --> 02:49:32,670
This is all good to go.

1266
02:49:34,440 --> 02:49:35,079
We'll do a feeding.

1267
02:49:35,079 --> 02:49:35,799
We'll do a collection.

1268
02:49:35,799 --> 02:49:36,520
We'll do a selling.

1269
02:49:36,520 --> 02:49:38,120
And then I'm going to go do a quest.

1270
02:49:40,010 --> 02:49:51,360
Chicken.

1271
02:49:51,360 --> 02:49:51,760
Chickens.

1272
02:49:52,399 --> 02:49:54,989
Oh, fuck.

1273
02:49:54,989 --> 02:49:59,100
It was that guy.

1274
02:49:59,100 --> 02:49:59,260
OK.

1275
02:49:59,979 --> 02:50:04,809
Oh, wrong.

1276
02:50:06,649 --> 02:50:18,879
I'm going to do I need eight chickens and one rooster.

1277
02:50:33,920 --> 02:50:36,000
Am I going to just wipe out this population?

1278
02:50:42,750 --> 02:50:44,670
There's no more red chickens.

1279
02:50:45,629 --> 02:50:47,229
I'm going to sneeze it.

1280
02:50:47,229 --> 02:50:47,469
I can't.

1281
02:50:48,909 --> 02:50:49,549
OK, I got it.

1282
02:50:50,190 --> 02:50:51,629
That came out of nowhere.

1283
02:51:10,200 --> 02:51:11,719
I'm wiping out this whole population.

1284
02:51:12,520 --> 02:51:13,959
No, I need to grow.

1285
02:51:13,959 --> 02:51:14,840
Have people grow up first.

1286
02:51:16,559 --> 02:51:17,920
You guys just keep having chickens.

1287
02:51:17,920 --> 02:51:18,479
Go on.

1288
02:51:18,479 --> 02:51:25,290
OK, here we go.

1289
02:51:25,290 --> 02:51:25,850
Let's feed.

1290
02:51:25,850 --> 02:51:26,489
Collect.

1291
02:51:26,489 --> 02:51:26,889
Sell.

1292
02:51:26,889 --> 02:51:28,729
And then I'm going to go find some chickens.

1293
02:51:36,959 --> 02:51:37,600
I'm feeding you.

1294
02:51:37,600 --> 02:51:37,920
I got you.

1295
02:51:37,920 --> 02:51:38,319
I got you.

1296
02:51:38,959 --> 02:51:51,600
I know it's clogged.

1297
02:51:52,159 --> 02:51:56,329
Get in there.

1298
02:51:56,809 --> 02:52:02,190
I guess I guess good.

1299
02:52:02,190 --> 02:52:02,670
Who's eating?

1300
02:52:03,479 --> 02:52:03,719
Eat.

1301
02:52:08,190 --> 02:52:08,590
You'll eat.

1302
02:52:08,590 --> 02:52:09,069
Keep eating.

1303
02:52:09,069 --> 02:52:09,469
Gone.

1304
02:52:09,469 --> 02:52:09,790
Gone.

1305
02:52:09,790 --> 02:52:10,750
Eat, eat, eat, eat, eat.

1306
02:52:11,469 --> 02:52:16,430
If you have too many chickens in the pen, they won't have Zex.

1307
02:52:16,430 --> 02:52:18,190
OK, is that a real thing?

1308
02:52:18,190 --> 02:52:19,309
Because that's good to know.

1309
02:52:20,030 --> 02:52:38,559
OK, we just have stony hens left, but whatever.

1310
02:52:39,120 --> 02:52:40,479
I can replenish that population.

1311
02:52:49,129 --> 02:52:49,450
Nice.

1312
02:52:50,090 --> 02:52:50,889
It's a lot of money.

1313
02:52:58,639 --> 02:52:59,760
And a lot of pod fruit, too.

1314
02:52:59,760 --> 02:53:00,879
All right, I'm going to store the pod fruit

1315
02:53:00,879 --> 02:53:02,399
because somebody usually randomly just wants it.

1316
02:53:07,149 --> 02:53:09,850
Hmm, sell these.

1317
02:53:10,649 --> 02:53:12,139
What's it got in here?

1318
02:53:12,700 --> 02:53:13,739
Sell this shit, too.

1319
02:53:13,739 --> 02:53:14,379
I'm not going to make.

1320
02:53:14,379 --> 02:53:15,420
I'm just not going to make them.

1321
02:53:15,420 --> 02:53:17,180
Maybe I will eventually, but not right now.

1322
02:53:24,639 --> 02:53:25,280
That shit up.

1323
02:53:30,170 --> 02:53:30,649
I have enough.

1324
02:53:35,840 --> 02:53:36,559
All right, cool.

1325
02:53:36,559 --> 02:53:37,680
I can buy the new.

1326
02:53:37,680 --> 02:53:38,719
I'm going to buy grotto.

1327
02:53:44,489 --> 02:53:45,370
No, wrong.

1328
02:53:45,370 --> 02:53:52,479
I need to buy a couple more plots, too.

1329
02:53:57,290 --> 02:53:57,610
Got it.

1330
02:53:58,479 --> 02:53:59,280
A grotto.

1331
02:53:59,280 --> 02:54:00,239
Oh, I'm so excited.

1332
02:54:00,879 --> 02:54:04,969
So what's over here?

1333
02:54:04,969 --> 02:54:11,610
Before I left the ranch, I found myself sleeping most nights in here.

1334
02:54:11,610 --> 02:54:13,049
In this here grotto.

1335
02:54:13,049 --> 02:54:16,170
I fill it full of phosphor slimes and watch them dance in the dark.

1336
02:54:16,809 --> 02:54:21,370
Drifting off, I pretend I was drifting in a sea of stars across the limitless black of space.

1337
02:54:22,170 --> 02:54:25,450
It's funny how when you dream, you should become a sucker for the impossible.

1338
02:54:26,090 --> 02:54:30,010
Every time I woke to find myself back in the grotto, I'd feel a little sadness.

1339
02:54:30,010 --> 02:54:32,590
But then it was back to work.

1340
02:54:32,590 --> 02:54:36,200
It was always something that needed doing.

1341
02:54:36,200 --> 02:54:38,040
Oh, it's just extra space.

1342
02:54:38,040 --> 02:54:40,350
All right, I get it.

1343
02:54:40,350 --> 02:54:40,909
Oh, shit.

1344
02:54:40,909 --> 02:54:42,510
OK, there's just a bunch of more plots.

1345
02:54:42,510 --> 02:54:42,909
I get it.

1346
02:54:42,909 --> 02:54:47,879
OK, that was funny.

1347
02:54:47,879 --> 02:54:49,079
I wasn't trying to be funny.

1348
02:54:49,639 --> 02:54:50,780
What did you do?

1349
02:54:50,780 --> 02:54:58,299
Well, let's just make a...

1350
02:54:58,299 --> 02:55:01,319
OK, I got one of these.

1351
02:55:01,879 --> 02:55:04,520
So there are certain slimes that only want to be at night, right?

1352
02:55:05,079 --> 02:55:10,700
So let's put the night slimes in there.

1353
02:55:18,360 --> 02:55:19,000
Pond.

1354
02:55:19,000 --> 02:55:23,610
They make a pond?

1355
02:55:24,170 --> 02:55:31,420
Fresh water on the ranch.

1356
02:55:31,420 --> 02:55:36,829
Oh, little slime.

1357
02:55:36,829 --> 02:55:37,069
Eh.

1358
02:55:43,370 --> 02:55:44,010
How do I go back?

1359
02:55:47,879 --> 02:55:48,840
How do I get out of here?

1360
02:55:49,479 --> 02:55:50,040
Oh, OK.

1361
02:55:50,600 --> 02:56:01,309
Happy Valentine's Day.

1362
02:56:01,309 --> 02:56:01,950
Oh, that's right.

1363
02:56:01,950 --> 02:56:03,870
It is Valentine's Day like soon, isn't it?

1364
02:56:03,870 --> 02:56:04,989
Was it tomorrow?

1365
02:56:04,989 --> 02:56:10,170
It is tomorrow.

1366
02:56:10,170 --> 02:56:12,489
Hey, happy Valentine's Day tomorrow.

1367
02:56:12,489 --> 02:56:18,700
Am I streaming tomorrow?

1368
02:56:18,700 --> 02:56:19,739
No, I'm not.

1369
02:56:19,739 --> 02:56:24,090
What's this?

1370
02:56:24,090 --> 02:56:28,250
Not streaming on Valentine's Day.

1371
02:56:28,250 --> 02:56:29,850
Happy Valentine's Day, though.

1372
02:56:29,850 --> 02:56:34,959
If you have a significant other, then very cool.

1373
02:56:34,959 --> 02:56:36,879
If not, then it doesn't matter.

1374
02:56:37,440 --> 02:56:42,809
It doesn't matter.

1375
02:56:42,809 --> 02:56:45,020
Who do I want to talk to?

1376
02:56:45,579 --> 02:56:51,959
Who paid me more money?

1377
02:56:52,520 --> 02:57:00,590
Is there a raid coming in?

1378
02:57:00,590 --> 02:57:03,629
We do have a raid coming in.

1379
02:57:03,629 --> 02:57:08,540
It's a raid from Limealicious.

1380
02:57:08,540 --> 02:57:09,819
Thanks to the raid, Limealicious.

1381
02:57:10,379 --> 02:57:13,899
Welcome, everybody.

1382
02:57:13,899 --> 02:57:14,139
Hi.

1383
02:57:14,780 --> 02:57:16,319
How you guys doing?

1384
02:57:16,639 --> 02:57:21,870
It's me, Jeremy, singing a raid song.

1385
02:57:21,870 --> 02:57:22,989
No, we don't do raid songs.

1386
02:57:24,350 --> 02:57:26,270
I don't do a raid song here.

1387
02:57:26,270 --> 02:57:28,350
What we do is we show you a counter on the screen

1388
02:57:28,350 --> 02:57:30,190
of how much money is being deducted

1389
02:57:30,909 --> 02:57:35,629
from my pretend joke, laugh out loud, yellow bell bank account.

1390
02:57:39,159 --> 02:57:40,440
Hope you had a good stream, Limealicious.

1391
02:57:40,440 --> 02:57:41,239
Thanks for the raid.

1392
02:57:41,239 --> 02:57:41,879
Welcome, guys.

1393
02:57:44,889 --> 02:57:45,610
Let's talk to Victor.

1394
02:57:46,329 --> 02:57:48,649
If possible, please acquire the following for a future study.

1395
02:57:48,649 --> 02:57:49,149
Thanks.

1396
02:57:53,719 --> 02:57:55,239
I always have such a pain in the ass to get these.

1397
02:58:02,120 --> 02:58:02,680
How many do I need?

1398
02:58:03,659 --> 02:58:05,180
Six, six, nine.

1399
02:58:05,180 --> 02:58:06,700
I just suck up a bunch of people.

1400
02:58:06,700 --> 02:58:07,719
I got it.

1401
02:58:07,719 --> 02:58:09,040
Got it.

1402
02:58:09,040 --> 02:58:09,360
All right.

1403
02:58:11,020 --> 02:58:11,659
Get it.

1404
02:58:11,659 --> 02:58:12,780
Get it.

1405
02:58:12,780 --> 02:58:13,260
Get it.

1406
02:58:13,260 --> 02:58:14,059
Peter Griffin.

1407
02:58:14,059 --> 02:58:15,280
Get it.

1408
02:58:15,280 --> 02:58:18,479
All 300 people that just came and just left immediately.

1409
02:58:18,479 --> 02:58:25,040
I need nine of these.

1410
02:58:25,760 --> 02:58:30,670
All right.

1411
02:58:30,670 --> 02:58:31,149
That's fine.

1412
02:58:33,690 --> 02:58:34,729
Who wants a carrot?

1413
02:58:34,729 --> 02:58:35,229
One, two.

1414
02:58:36,090 --> 02:58:36,639
All right.

1415
02:58:36,639 --> 02:58:37,120
Now I need...

1416
02:58:38,000 --> 02:58:39,600
I almost just said bunnies again.

1417
02:58:39,600 --> 02:58:40,239
They're not bunnies.

1418
02:58:40,239 --> 02:58:40,879
They're cats.

1419
02:58:51,340 --> 02:58:52,940
Germa is an acquired taste.

1420
02:58:58,649 --> 02:58:58,809
What?

1421
02:58:58,809 --> 02:59:01,049
I'm like a whiskey or something?

1422
02:59:01,770 --> 02:59:05,049
I'm a very expensive, gross, acidic, painful liquid.

1423
02:59:05,770 --> 02:59:10,329
And if you have it enough times, it makes you feel really, really good.

1424
02:59:20,889 --> 02:59:21,129
No.

1425
02:59:27,879 --> 02:59:29,479
No, you're a shitty vodka.

1426
02:59:32,860 --> 02:59:33,340
Whatever.

1427
02:59:33,979 --> 02:59:34,620
What are these?

1428
02:59:35,340 --> 02:59:36,889
What are these?

1429
02:59:36,889 --> 02:59:37,530
Little nuts.

1430
02:59:39,840 --> 02:59:40,959
Shitty vodka.

1431
02:59:41,680 --> 02:59:45,790
So what?

1432
02:59:45,790 --> 02:59:46,430
You're saying that...

1433
02:59:47,450 --> 02:59:48,329
Let's go the other way.

1434
02:59:48,329 --> 02:59:49,290
So I'm cheap.

1435
02:59:50,329 --> 02:59:51,370
I taste terrible.

1436
02:59:52,940 --> 02:59:55,659
And it feels nice for like a half an hour.

1437
02:59:55,659 --> 02:59:57,579
And then you puke for the rest of the evening.

1438
02:59:58,299 --> 03:00:00,360
Is that what I am?

1439
03:00:01,239 --> 03:00:11,559
I keep eating the things and turning them into...

1440
03:00:11,559 --> 03:00:12,440
Whatever.

1441
03:00:12,440 --> 03:00:17,079
No, you're a good kush.

1442
03:00:23,040 --> 03:00:24,079
It feels terrible.

1443
03:00:24,079 --> 03:00:24,959
And I know it does.

1444
03:00:24,959 --> 03:00:26,399
But I can't stop doing it.

1445
03:00:26,399 --> 03:00:27,280
What the fuck?

1446
03:00:27,840 --> 03:00:31,069
Come here.

1447
03:00:37,290 --> 03:00:37,610
God.

1448
03:00:41,020 --> 03:00:41,819
Multiple chickens.

1449
03:00:42,540 --> 03:00:45,440
Brock's lime.

1450
03:00:46,639 --> 03:00:48,000
I almost just called that a tater tot.

1451
03:00:54,590 --> 03:00:54,909
Okay.

1452
03:00:54,909 --> 03:00:55,629
Here we go.

1453
03:00:55,629 --> 03:00:56,110
Feed.

1454
03:00:56,110 --> 03:00:56,430
Again.

1455
03:00:56,430 --> 03:00:57,469
Here's 10 more.

1456
03:00:58,110 --> 03:01:02,479
How could you eat this much food?

1457
03:01:03,040 --> 03:01:05,040
Looks like it's gonna explode.

1458
03:01:05,040 --> 03:01:05,600
Is he all right?

1459
03:01:06,159 --> 03:01:16,670
I need more cats.

1460
03:01:17,229 --> 03:01:21,799
What's the new area?

1461
03:01:21,799 --> 03:01:22,920
Oh, there's a new area.

1462
03:01:24,590 --> 03:01:25,629
Guys, new area.

1463
03:01:28,440 --> 03:01:29,239
Oh, I need a key.

1464
03:01:38,969 --> 03:01:41,260
Oh, he just fell.

1465
03:01:41,979 --> 03:01:43,370
Careful.

1466
03:01:43,370 --> 03:01:44,250
Careful of the bridge.

1467
03:01:44,250 --> 03:01:45,610
Don't fall over.

1468
03:01:45,610 --> 03:01:46,489
No, you're gonna fall.

1469
03:01:47,290 --> 03:01:48,459
Oh no.

1470
03:01:49,739 --> 03:01:51,100
Okay, I'm fucking out of here.

1471
03:01:51,100 --> 03:01:51,739
I'm sorry.

1472
03:01:55,340 --> 03:01:55,579
Okay.

1473
03:01:58,090 --> 03:02:04,239
That was just a stinky monkey guy.

1474
03:02:14,159 --> 03:02:15,200
No, I wanted that.

1475
03:02:24,649 --> 03:02:26,010
Just load up on little chickens.

1476
03:02:29,370 --> 03:02:30,409
Oh, big chickens over there.

1477
03:02:31,209 --> 03:02:31,770
Regenerate.

1478
03:02:32,409 --> 03:02:39,079
I've seen the world record-breaking speedrun.

1479
03:02:39,079 --> 03:02:40,680
This is not even anything like your playthrough.

1480
03:02:40,680 --> 03:02:41,399
Are you even trying?

1481
03:02:44,350 --> 03:02:44,909
Get out of here.

1482
03:02:51,000 --> 03:02:51,959
I'm gonna deposit these guys.

1483
03:02:51,959 --> 03:02:52,680
I'll come back tomorrow.

1484
03:02:54,090 --> 03:02:55,530
Still need a few more rocks.

1485
03:03:03,930 --> 03:03:04,489
Stinky.

1486
03:03:05,959 --> 03:03:16,670
Sorry.

1487
03:03:16,670 --> 03:03:18,430
I don't even think that's funny.

1488
03:03:19,149 --> 03:03:20,250
But I do now.

1489
03:03:20,250 --> 03:03:20,809
I don't know why.

1490
03:03:27,469 --> 03:03:28,350
Chickens, get in there.

1491
03:03:29,069 --> 03:03:39,790
And three.

1492
03:03:40,590 --> 03:03:43,260
Need three more rocks.

1493
03:03:47,209 --> 03:03:48,010
Okay, do I have?

1494
03:03:48,729 --> 03:03:50,829
I could turn these into the other guys, right?

1495
03:03:50,829 --> 03:03:52,590
Do I have any of the other stones?

1496
03:03:53,309 --> 03:03:55,370
I don't think I have the other stones.

1497
03:04:01,680 --> 03:04:01,920
Yes.

1498
03:04:02,799 --> 03:04:04,000
Yes, I'll get the stones.

1499
03:04:04,719 --> 03:04:06,270
I'll go after those stones.

1500
03:04:09,229 --> 03:04:10,909
Yes, of course, I'll get the stones.

1501
03:04:15,100 --> 03:04:15,579
Three more.

1502
03:04:16,139 --> 03:04:26,760
What are you talking about?

1503
03:04:28,920 --> 03:04:30,040
Some of you know, and I don't care.

1504
03:04:30,840 --> 03:04:32,760
There's a 12,000 people here.

1505
03:04:32,760 --> 03:04:34,120
Even 10 of you knew what I was just doing.

1506
03:04:34,680 --> 03:04:36,600
Oh, because you just screamed at the TV.

1507
03:04:36,600 --> 03:04:38,120
I saw that movie.

1508
03:04:38,120 --> 03:04:40,889
Okay, I need to upgrade.

1509
03:04:45,309 --> 03:04:45,950
Solar Shield.

1510
03:04:45,950 --> 03:04:47,870
A solar shield in case of coral and dim shade,

1511
03:04:47,870 --> 03:04:49,469
protecting slimes to sensitive to light.

1512
03:04:49,469 --> 03:04:49,709
Okay.

1513
03:04:50,590 --> 03:04:51,870
How about a music box?

1514
03:04:51,870 --> 03:04:56,559
I think I want to turn these guys into someone else.

1515
03:05:04,110 --> 03:05:06,190
Now are we on each other's TVs?

1516
03:05:06,989 --> 03:05:09,770
You got, you're right.

1517
03:05:09,770 --> 03:05:11,209
Wow, it's been a while since I've done that.

1518
03:05:13,200 --> 03:05:13,520
Fuck.

1519
03:05:14,239 --> 03:05:17,760
Oh my God, I forgot about that.

1520
03:05:17,760 --> 03:05:18,479
I love that.

1521
03:05:19,360 --> 03:05:29,950
I don't watch movies.

1522
03:05:29,950 --> 03:05:30,510
That's not a movie.

1523
03:05:30,510 --> 03:05:31,629
That's like a Facebook ad.

1524
03:05:32,350 --> 03:05:38,299
I got a lot of these.

1525
03:05:38,299 --> 03:05:39,180
It's time to sell them.

1526
03:05:39,819 --> 03:05:49,290
And I'm going to start expanding how many people I have.

1527
03:06:01,040 --> 03:06:05,149
Are we on each other's TV?

1528
03:06:17,319 --> 03:06:19,879
Okay.

1529
03:06:19,879 --> 03:06:21,309
Market, go up.

1530
03:06:23,360 --> 03:06:24,079
Market, go up.

1531
03:06:25,360 --> 03:06:26,159
Market, go up.

1532
03:06:26,719 --> 03:06:29,959
This market sucks.

1533
03:06:30,840 --> 03:06:39,440
Initiate.

1534
03:06:40,250 --> 03:06:41,610
Rooster Weather Vane.

1535
03:06:41,610 --> 03:06:42,170
What is that?

1536
03:06:47,239 --> 03:06:48,120
New Bucks.

1537
03:06:48,200 --> 03:06:54,959
I get this.

1538
03:06:54,959 --> 03:07:10,159
All right, come on.

1539
03:07:10,799 --> 03:07:11,520
Market.

1540
03:07:11,520 --> 03:07:12,920
Whatever.

1541
03:07:12,920 --> 03:07:13,319
Just sell.

1542
03:07:26,520 --> 03:07:27,000
What are you talking about?

1543
03:07:27,000 --> 03:07:27,799
Search what?

1544
03:07:27,799 --> 03:07:34,329
Searching anything.

1545
03:07:34,329 --> 03:07:34,889
All right.

1546
03:07:34,889 --> 03:07:35,930
Everybody's good.

1547
03:07:35,930 --> 03:07:37,370
Look at all these new chickens.

1548
03:07:37,370 --> 03:07:42,559
This is maxed out.

1549
03:07:42,559 --> 03:07:44,559
I'm going to go on an expedition here

1550
03:07:44,559 --> 03:07:49,520
and I'm going to go get a bunch of new slimes

1551
03:07:49,520 --> 03:07:50,879
and they're going to go up here.

1552
03:07:50,879 --> 03:07:52,200
Take a look at this.

1553
03:07:53,360 --> 03:07:53,680
Bang.

1554
03:07:55,209 --> 03:07:58,379
And boom.

1555
03:07:58,379 --> 03:08:02,440
And boink.

1556
03:08:02,440 --> 03:08:04,280
I want a new slime in here.

1557
03:08:04,280 --> 03:08:07,399
Let's go get one.

1558
03:08:07,399 --> 03:08:13,020
I need the rock slimes.

1559
03:08:13,020 --> 03:08:13,819
You're right.

1560
03:08:13,819 --> 03:08:15,120
I'll get those too.

1561
03:08:18,969 --> 03:08:20,729
This time I'm going to go get rocks.

1562
03:08:20,729 --> 03:08:23,340
See if we can make like blue or something.

1563
03:08:24,280 --> 03:08:25,319
I'll definitely take these chickens.

1564
03:08:25,319 --> 03:08:25,959
Why the hell not?

1565
03:08:26,520 --> 03:08:37,709
You can use a jetpack to get to the do-

1566
03:08:37,709 --> 03:08:38,350
I want to-

1567
03:08:38,350 --> 03:08:39,389
I'm going over here.

1568
03:08:39,389 --> 03:08:41,020
What is this place?

1569
03:08:41,020 --> 03:08:48,760
It's a big guy.

1570
03:08:48,760 --> 03:08:49,819
What does he want?

1571
03:08:49,819 --> 03:08:55,389
He wants mushrooms.

1572
03:08:55,389 --> 03:08:56,510
Oh, what's this again?

1573
03:08:56,510 --> 03:09:01,879
There's a shitload of chickens in there.

1574
03:09:01,879 --> 03:09:02,680
All right, cool.

1575
03:09:02,680 --> 03:09:03,719
Do you want chickens?

1576
03:09:05,309 --> 03:09:06,270
You eat chickens.

1577
03:09:07,520 --> 03:09:08,719
Just like the other one.

1578
03:09:08,719 --> 03:09:12,000
Oh, shit.

1579
03:09:12,000 --> 03:09:12,799
What is this?

1580
03:09:12,799 --> 03:09:18,760
It's Blarkey.

1581
03:09:19,399 --> 03:09:21,879
Visit the ranch house to manage secret styles.

1582
03:09:21,879 --> 03:09:22,120
Cool.

1583
03:09:29,719 --> 03:09:30,520
He eats anything.

1584
03:09:30,520 --> 03:09:31,559
All right, so I'm just going to load him up

1585
03:09:31,559 --> 03:09:32,760
with cheap fruits.

1586
03:09:33,479 --> 03:09:43,840
He should have had some of his own slime,

1587
03:09:43,840 --> 03:09:44,319
to be honest.

1588
03:09:44,319 --> 03:09:45,600
Not that if he has anything else to do.

1589
03:09:46,399 --> 03:09:55,790
All right, I think I don't-

1590
03:09:55,790 --> 03:09:56,510
Do I want a cat?

1591
03:09:57,069 --> 03:09:59,079
What about a rock cat?

1592
03:09:59,639 --> 03:10:03,319
What about a rock cat?

1593
03:10:03,319 --> 03:10:05,239
Would that be cool?

1594
03:10:10,270 --> 03:10:11,709
It would be a blue rock cat, right?

1595
03:10:12,270 --> 03:10:16,760
Come here.

1596
03:10:16,760 --> 03:10:20,639
That would be epic.

1597
03:10:20,639 --> 03:10:22,920
I'll try it.

1598
03:10:22,920 --> 03:10:25,200
What if I do a flying cat?

1599
03:10:25,200 --> 03:10:28,920
We're going to experiment.

1600
03:10:31,450 --> 03:10:40,879
I'm going to do an experimentation.

1601
03:10:41,440 --> 03:10:51,770
It happened.

1602
03:10:51,770 --> 03:10:52,639
It happened.

1603
03:10:53,920 --> 03:10:54,479
It happened.

1604
03:10:55,790 --> 03:10:56,670
No, wait, don't die.

1605
03:10:57,469 --> 03:11:04,299
What did it-

1606
03:11:04,940 --> 03:11:05,819
There's presents in here.

1607
03:11:05,819 --> 03:11:06,139
Hold on.

1608
03:11:09,500 --> 03:11:10,299
Whoa, what's in here?

1609
03:11:10,299 --> 03:11:10,940
Fruits and stuff?

1610
03:11:11,579 --> 03:11:17,200
Holy shit, what's that?

1611
03:11:17,200 --> 03:11:18,540
What is that?

1612
03:11:18,540 --> 03:11:21,149
Cloudy ornament?

1613
03:11:21,790 --> 03:11:27,850
Okay.

1614
03:11:29,319 --> 03:11:31,000
Fucking goddamn epic game store.

1615
03:11:31,000 --> 03:11:32,120
Game event.

1616
03:11:32,120 --> 03:11:32,760
Fortnite.

1617
03:11:32,760 --> 03:11:33,319
The Flash.

1618
03:11:34,280 --> 03:11:35,959
Striking the island with lightning speed.

1619
03:11:35,959 --> 03:11:38,200
The fastest man alive is join the hunt.

1620
03:11:38,200 --> 03:11:40,120
Catch the Flash set in the item shop

1621
03:11:40,120 --> 03:11:40,840
and it won't go away.

1622
03:11:41,719 --> 03:11:47,280
Do I even have that open?

1623
03:11:47,920 --> 03:11:54,729
Is this a teleporter?

1624
03:11:57,079 --> 03:11:58,280
Oh my god, hell yeah.

1625
03:11:59,000 --> 03:12:01,069
Wait, where am I?

1626
03:12:01,549 --> 03:12:07,200
The docks.

1627
03:12:07,200 --> 03:12:08,000
5,000.

1628
03:12:08,639 --> 03:12:13,399
Where am I?

1629
03:12:17,920 --> 03:12:19,120
Wait, where am I?

1630
03:12:19,120 --> 03:12:20,030
What's going on?

1631
03:12:21,129 --> 03:12:21,690
What?

1632
03:12:21,690 --> 03:12:33,850
How do I get out of here?

1633
03:12:33,850 --> 03:12:38,729
This is a new area?

1634
03:12:38,729 --> 03:12:45,770
You haven't unlocked that area.

1635
03:12:47,129 --> 03:12:48,809
I can teleport into it, but I can't.

1636
03:12:48,809 --> 03:12:49,370
Okay, whatever.

1637
03:12:50,170 --> 03:12:50,909
All right, all right.

1638
03:12:50,909 --> 03:12:51,549
I fed that guy.

1639
03:12:51,549 --> 03:12:51,950
He's done.

1640
03:12:52,510 --> 03:12:54,319
How much money do I get for that?

1641
03:12:54,959 --> 03:12:56,809
I got-

1642
03:12:56,809 --> 03:12:57,690
It's sequence broke.

1643
03:12:57,690 --> 03:12:58,170
Oh well.

1644
03:13:03,799 --> 03:13:04,840
I have a bunch of cats.

1645
03:13:04,840 --> 03:13:06,920
I want to go back and do some experimentation.

1646
03:13:06,920 --> 03:13:11,180
I don't need this.

1647
03:13:11,180 --> 03:13:11,659
Get rid of it.

1648
03:13:19,879 --> 03:13:21,559
All right, so that's what that does.

1649
03:13:22,360 --> 03:13:23,420
Now if-

1650
03:13:31,680 --> 03:13:33,280
I could do rock cats.

1651
03:13:33,280 --> 03:13:34,319
Blue rock cats.

1652
03:13:35,200 --> 03:13:41,600
I could have two different kinds of cats.

1653
03:13:42,159 --> 03:13:49,049
You already have rocks and cats.

1654
03:13:49,049 --> 03:13:51,049
Yes, but I don't have rock cats.

1655
03:13:51,049 --> 03:14:00,909
I have cats.

1656
03:14:00,909 --> 03:14:01,629
I have rocks.

1657
03:14:01,629 --> 03:14:02,909
I don't have rock cats.

1658
03:14:17,920 --> 03:14:19,709
Cool.

1659
03:14:19,709 --> 03:14:21,149
He likes veggies and meat.

1660
03:14:21,149 --> 03:14:25,600
Make flying cats.

1661
03:14:25,600 --> 03:14:28,840
Fly cat is more useful.

1662
03:14:28,840 --> 03:14:30,569
This was checking.

1663
03:14:32,680 --> 03:14:34,520
I think I sold all the flying ones.

1664
03:14:35,159 --> 03:14:37,549
Did I sell all the flying ones?

1665
03:14:37,549 --> 03:14:38,110
I think I did.

1666
03:14:38,909 --> 03:14:39,559
How do you want-

1667
03:14:39,559 --> 03:14:40,120
What does this do?

1668
03:14:40,760 --> 03:14:43,440
What does this do?

1669
03:14:43,440 --> 03:14:44,000
How do I use it?

1670
03:14:44,559 --> 03:14:50,250
The decoration?

1671
03:14:50,809 --> 03:14:51,819
Just put it down?

1672
03:14:52,459 --> 03:14:54,280
Oh.

1673
03:14:54,280 --> 03:15:18,879
Oh, got a call.

1674
03:15:18,879 --> 03:15:19,760
Bob wants chickens.

1675
03:15:20,750 --> 03:15:22,110
Chickens, chickens, chickens, chickens, chickens.

1676
03:15:22,110 --> 03:15:22,430
Yep.

1677
03:15:22,430 --> 03:15:22,750
I got-

1678
03:15:22,750 --> 03:15:23,549
I got them, Bob.

1679
03:15:23,549 --> 03:15:25,180
I got plenty of them.

1680
03:15:25,180 --> 03:15:25,739
Ooh.

1681
03:15:25,739 --> 03:15:27,340
And I get those and I can make cats.

1682
03:15:27,340 --> 03:15:30,620
You want a rooster?

1683
03:15:30,620 --> 03:15:35,389
All right, wait, how many-

1684
03:15:35,389 --> 03:15:36,350
This one's different.

1685
03:15:36,350 --> 03:15:37,069
What is that one?

1686
03:15:40,030 --> 03:15:40,829
Elder hen.

1687
03:15:40,829 --> 03:15:43,629
An old bird whose egg laying days are over.

1688
03:15:44,430 --> 03:15:52,139
How many does he want?

1689
03:15:52,139 --> 03:16:01,899
All right, he needs four more of those.

1690
03:16:02,540 --> 03:16:06,719
One, two.

1691
03:16:07,600 --> 03:16:08,989
Shit.

1692
03:16:09,549 --> 03:16:32,430
Wait, what?

1693
03:16:32,430 --> 03:16:32,750
Why?

1694
03:16:33,309 --> 03:16:34,639
When you feed the-

1695
03:16:34,639 --> 03:16:37,309
That's the cycle, right?

1696
03:16:43,040 --> 03:16:44,959
I respect that hen very much.

1697
03:16:47,159 --> 03:16:50,040
It did a lot of good work and was a wonderful, wonderful bird.

1698
03:16:51,399 --> 03:16:52,280
But they eat them.

1699
03:16:53,930 --> 03:16:55,209
But they eat them.

1700
03:16:55,209 --> 03:16:56,250
What the hell was that?

1701
03:16:57,049 --> 03:16:58,090
But they eat them.

1702
03:17:01,629 --> 03:17:05,549
That was like a three-year-old explaining to you why they ate crayons.

1703
03:17:07,770 --> 03:17:10,139
Himi, did you-

1704
03:17:10,139 --> 03:17:11,739
Did you eat the box of crayons?

1705
03:17:12,379 --> 03:17:15,180
Yes, but that's a cycle.

1706
03:17:15,180 --> 03:17:16,459
I like blue.

1707
03:17:16,459 --> 03:17:18,540
So I eat them.

1708
03:17:18,540 --> 03:17:21,600
I ran out of pink.

1709
03:17:21,600 --> 03:17:22,399
So I eat blue.

1710
03:17:23,610 --> 03:17:23,930
Okay.

1711
03:17:24,649 --> 03:17:26,170
I like eating blue crayon.

1712
03:17:26,170 --> 03:17:26,969
That's why I do it.

1713
03:17:26,969 --> 03:17:28,010
That's the cycle of life.

1714
03:17:34,170 --> 03:17:35,450
I got you, I got you, I got you.

1715
03:17:44,079 --> 03:17:44,879
Fill up.

1716
03:17:44,879 --> 03:17:52,639
Hello.

1717
03:17:52,639 --> 03:17:53,360
What do you eat?

1718
03:17:56,559 --> 03:17:57,360
I think you like-

1719
03:17:57,360 --> 03:17:58,319
Scrumptious games.

1720
03:18:03,049 --> 03:18:04,959
Here, have some.

1721
03:18:05,520 --> 03:18:07,770
What do you poop on?

1722
03:18:07,770 --> 03:18:09,129
I don't think I've ever seen you poop before.

1723
03:18:09,129 --> 03:18:10,170
Let's stare at it.

1724
03:18:10,809 --> 03:18:18,110
Captain.

1725
03:18:18,110 --> 03:18:18,989
You poop-

1726
03:18:18,989 --> 03:18:22,110
Wow, that's a lot.

1727
03:18:22,750 --> 03:18:26,700
That's actually a lot.

1728
03:18:35,950 --> 03:18:37,069
That's kind of gross.

1729
03:18:39,530 --> 03:18:39,930
Captain.

1730
03:18:41,280 --> 03:18:42,000
I'm sorry.

1731
03:18:42,959 --> 03:18:44,239
How many more do you want?

1732
03:18:44,239 --> 03:18:45,680
You need a few more of these.

1733
03:18:45,680 --> 03:18:46,159
Two more.

1734
03:18:48,829 --> 03:18:50,510
Two more just regular hens.

1735
03:18:51,229 --> 03:18:52,170
I'll go grab them.

1736
03:18:59,450 --> 03:19:00,329
Make an auto feeder.

1737
03:19:00,329 --> 03:19:00,729
I will.

1738
03:19:06,590 --> 03:19:07,629
I need-

1739
03:19:07,629 --> 03:19:08,030
What the hell?

1740
03:19:08,030 --> 03:19:08,670
What am I looking for?

1741
03:19:09,229 --> 03:19:10,430
What am I doing out here?

1742
03:19:10,430 --> 03:19:13,200
What am I doing out here?

1743
03:19:13,760 --> 03:19:15,469
Oh, chickens.

1744
03:19:30,409 --> 03:19:35,450
Give chicken.

1745
03:19:35,450 --> 03:19:36,170
Give chicken.

1746
03:19:39,520 --> 03:19:40,319
You dickhead.

1747
03:19:41,120 --> 03:19:41,920
You're a dickhead.

1748
03:19:42,479 --> 03:19:51,309
Chicken.

1749
03:19:51,950 --> 03:19:53,709
No, that's a stony chicken.

1750
03:19:53,709 --> 03:19:54,430
Yep.

1751
03:19:54,430 --> 03:20:10,489
Here we go.

1752
03:20:10,489 --> 03:20:11,930
All right, I got some phosphor slimes.

1753
03:20:11,930 --> 03:20:15,319
That's what I wanted.

1754
03:20:15,319 --> 03:20:18,170
I want to make cat phosphors.

1755
03:20:18,170 --> 03:20:19,129
Or phosphor rock.

1756
03:20:19,770 --> 03:20:22,329
Easy.

1757
03:20:22,329 --> 03:20:22,729
Easy.

1758
03:20:30,959 --> 03:20:31,680
I don't need that.

1759
03:20:35,450 --> 03:20:38,409
Yeah, I'm going to put them in the cave.

1760
03:20:38,409 --> 03:20:47,100
Phosphor rock.

1761
03:20:47,100 --> 03:20:48,219
Make sure you put them in the grotto.

1762
03:20:48,219 --> 03:20:49,659
Yeah, because it's nighttime, right?

1763
03:20:49,659 --> 03:20:56,379
I think I'm going to do phosphor.

1764
03:20:58,079 --> 03:20:58,959
What's the most expensive?

1765
03:20:59,920 --> 03:21:01,579
Someone said geode.

1766
03:21:01,579 --> 03:21:03,020
And speaking of geodes,

1767
03:21:03,020 --> 03:21:05,659
make sure you join us on the German 985 YouTube channel.

1768
03:21:05,659 --> 03:21:06,299

1771
03:21:07,819 --> 03:21:08,459
Let me start over.

1772
03:21:09,819 --> 03:21:10,780
And speaking of geodes,

1773
03:21:11,340 --> 03:21:12,459

On March 6th at 1 p.m. Pacific time

1776
03:21:19,020 --> 03:21:20,940
for an archaeology geology stream.

1777
03:21:21,680 --> 03:21:23,360
All kinds of wild things are going to happen.

1778
03:21:24,000 --> 03:21:25,120
Who knows what you can see?

1779
03:21:27,719 --> 03:21:28,200
Join us.

1780
03:21:38,170 --> 03:21:38,889
All right, I was going to say,

1781
03:21:38,889 --> 03:21:40,090
can I store animals?

1782
03:21:40,090 --> 03:21:41,049
But you can't.

1783
03:21:41,049 --> 03:21:43,549
I need to pick this shit up.

1784
03:21:44,110 --> 03:21:45,069
I need...

1785
03:22:05,389 --> 03:22:06,190
Somebody eat this.

1786
03:22:06,190 --> 03:22:06,829
I don't want them.

1787
03:22:07,469 --> 03:22:15,040
Okay, cool.

1788
03:22:15,600 --> 03:22:16,079
I'm ready.

1789
03:22:16,639 --> 03:22:18,110
We're going to go into the cave.

1790
03:22:20,059 --> 03:22:20,940
Go in the grotto.

1791
03:22:20,940 --> 03:22:21,819
Where's the grotto over here?

1792
03:22:22,540 --> 03:22:30,120
I need to experiment.

1793
03:22:35,680 --> 03:22:38,200
So I need a lid.

1794
03:22:38,760 --> 03:22:40,479
I need to just fly out.

1795
03:22:49,790 --> 03:22:52,989
Okay, so rock.

1796
03:22:52,989 --> 03:22:56,170
Should I do rock?

1797
03:22:56,170 --> 03:22:59,280
Flying bug or cat?

1798
03:22:59,280 --> 03:23:00,639
Flying cat.

1799
03:23:00,639 --> 03:23:05,600
That hurt.

1800
03:23:08,920 --> 03:23:10,360
Cat, flying cat.

1801
03:23:10,360 --> 03:23:11,079
I'll do fly...

1802
03:23:11,079 --> 03:23:11,879
I'll try flying cat.

1803
03:23:12,760 --> 03:23:24,510
Cool.

1804
03:23:30,200 --> 03:23:33,399
Eat that.

1805
03:23:33,399 --> 03:23:34,520
Now, what do you guys eat?

1806
03:23:34,520 --> 03:23:35,159
Fruit and meat.

1807
03:23:35,799 --> 03:23:38,879
Come on, eat.

1808
03:23:38,879 --> 03:23:41,600
When do you guys eat it?

1809
03:23:41,600 --> 03:23:42,700
There we go.

1810
03:23:43,690 --> 03:23:47,229
Eat this one.

1811
03:23:47,229 --> 03:23:48,590
I've been watching from the beginning

1812
03:23:48,590 --> 03:23:49,870
and I still don't know what you're doing in the game.

1813
03:23:52,559 --> 03:23:55,309
You're just making money.

1814
03:23:56,639 --> 03:23:57,520
Just make money.

1815
03:23:58,079 --> 03:23:59,950
Eat it.

1816
03:23:59,950 --> 03:24:08,569
Eat that.

1817
03:24:08,569 --> 03:24:09,370
You will eventually.

1818
03:24:09,370 --> 03:24:10,489
All right, what can I do?

1819
03:24:10,489 --> 03:24:13,850
I want to do solar shield?

1820
03:24:13,850 --> 03:24:14,090
No.

1821
03:24:14,649 --> 03:24:18,620
So you guys eat root and meat.

1822
03:24:18,620 --> 03:24:19,579
All right, I'm going to feed them.

1823
03:24:20,139 --> 03:24:25,930
I don't want to do too many.

1824
03:24:25,930 --> 03:24:26,409
Not too many.

1825
03:24:26,409 --> 03:24:27,610
I don't want to be crowded in here.

1826
03:24:27,610 --> 03:24:28,010
That's fine.

1827
03:24:28,010 --> 03:24:28,489
That's enough.

1828
03:24:29,209 --> 03:24:32,030
Cool.

1829
03:24:32,030 --> 03:24:33,149
All right, I need to make this bigger.

1830
03:24:33,149 --> 03:24:34,110
It's getting cramped in there.

1831
03:24:50,250 --> 03:24:51,610
Sell, sell, sell, sell, sell, sell.

1832
03:24:52,329 --> 03:24:57,290
Pea berries.

1833
03:24:57,290 --> 03:24:57,610
I know.

1834
03:24:57,610 --> 03:24:58,250
You're getting hungry.

1835
03:24:58,250 --> 03:24:58,649
I'm coming.

1836
03:24:59,450 --> 03:25:05,399
Eat up.

1837
03:25:05,399 --> 03:25:14,360
Looking good.

1838
03:25:15,159 --> 03:25:16,409
How's the market looking?

1839
03:25:16,409 --> 03:25:17,850
Is the market still dog shit?

1840
03:25:18,569 --> 03:25:24,000
Who are you in here?

1841
03:25:24,000 --> 03:25:25,040
You're a rock cat?

1842
03:25:25,760 --> 03:25:26,860
Oh, cool.

1843
03:25:26,860 --> 03:25:27,340
Yeah.

1844
03:25:27,340 --> 03:25:27,899
Yeah.

1845
03:25:27,899 --> 03:25:33,069
Oh, we have rock cats in here.

1846
03:25:37,520 --> 03:25:38,719
No, no, no, no, no.

1847
03:25:38,719 --> 03:25:39,920
Why are you doing that automatically?

1848
03:25:52,909 --> 03:25:55,739
Eat, eat.

1849
03:25:56,620 --> 03:25:59,739
Good.

1850
03:25:59,739 --> 03:26:01,180
All cats all the time.

1851
03:26:01,899 --> 03:26:06,059
That's a cool one.

1852
03:26:06,620 --> 03:26:07,260
I need a lid.

1853
03:26:12,299 --> 03:26:13,340
Tuck that up.

1854
03:26:13,340 --> 03:26:15,100
We're going to make a big sell here.

1855
03:26:20,719 --> 03:26:21,040
Oops.

1856
03:26:21,040 --> 03:26:21,760
All cats.

1857
03:26:21,760 --> 03:26:21,920
Yeah.

1858
03:26:21,920 --> 03:26:23,440
Well, I do.

1859
03:26:23,440 --> 03:26:23,840
Whatever.

1860
03:26:23,840 --> 03:26:24,479
I like cats.

1861
03:26:25,200 --> 03:26:29,120
And then we're going to go.

1862
03:26:29,120 --> 03:26:31,120
We're going to take a bunch of fruits and vegetables and shit.

1863
03:26:31,120 --> 03:26:32,719
We're going to go feed the hell out of that guy.

1864
03:26:33,280 --> 03:26:33,680
Big guy.

1865
03:26:34,239 --> 03:26:35,629
I'm going to sell.

1866
03:26:52,159 --> 03:26:52,879
Lots of rocks.

1867
03:26:56,920 --> 03:26:57,559
Good.

1868
03:26:57,559 --> 03:26:58,760
Have you guys gone to the bathroom yet?

1869
03:27:00,239 --> 03:27:00,799
You will.

1870
03:27:01,360 --> 03:27:07,260
I need to feed you guys because you need to go to the bathroom.

1871
03:27:07,260 --> 03:27:09,100
I need to put these guys in.

1872
03:27:10,600 --> 03:27:10,920
Yes.

1873
03:27:11,479 --> 03:27:12,920
This way.

1874
03:27:12,920 --> 03:27:17,340
Now, wait.

1875
03:27:17,340 --> 03:27:20,379
What do I do with the phosphorus limes?

1876
03:27:20,379 --> 03:27:21,440
Give them a new.

1877
03:27:21,440 --> 03:27:22,159
Give them a different pen.

1878
03:27:39,600 --> 03:27:41,600
Why is this market is going way down?

1879
03:27:47,760 --> 03:27:49,600
I'm getting such bad returns from this.

1880
03:27:50,319 --> 03:27:53,040
He's still in the first four plots.

1881
03:27:53,040 --> 03:27:54,000
Omega lul.

1882
03:27:54,000 --> 03:28:01,360
No, one, two, three, four, five and about to be a sixth for the phosphorus limes.

1883
03:28:04,409 --> 03:28:05,530
So excuse me.

1884
03:28:05,530 --> 03:28:06,409
You had it wrong.

1885
03:28:06,969 --> 03:28:10,649
I'm so sorry.

1886
03:28:10,649 --> 03:28:11,450
I don't even care.

1887
03:28:16,409 --> 03:28:21,129
I'm going to go feed the absolute hell of a hell out of that guy.

1888
03:28:22,409 --> 03:28:24,959
We're going to wipe out the entire harvest.

1889
03:28:40,270 --> 03:28:42,750
I have almost this guy's going to eat really well.

1890
03:28:43,870 --> 03:28:50,329
I could feed them a tabby.

1891
03:28:50,329 --> 03:28:51,049
Yeah, that's right.

1892
03:28:51,850 --> 03:28:52,969
That's right.

1893
03:28:52,969 --> 03:28:53,770
All right, we're going to get a tab.

1894
03:28:53,770 --> 03:28:54,969
We're going to get three tabbies.

1895
03:28:58,809 --> 03:28:59,930
Let's feed the tabbies.

1896
03:29:09,180 --> 03:29:11,370
Guys, hello.

1897
03:29:11,370 --> 03:29:15,799
Let's make this bigger.

1898
03:29:19,520 --> 03:29:20,239
There we go.

1899
03:29:20,239 --> 03:29:22,159
OK, now it's not so cramped in here.

1900
03:29:25,370 --> 03:29:34,040
OK, I want you guys to please eat up and give me some of those delicious gems.

1901
03:29:35,309 --> 03:29:36,190
Thank you.

1902
03:29:36,190 --> 03:29:46,200
OK, so now, yeah, I want you to over here in this.

1903
03:29:46,200 --> 03:29:46,760
No, no, no, no.

1904
03:29:46,760 --> 03:29:47,399
Come here.

1905
03:29:47,399 --> 03:29:47,799
Come here.

1906
03:29:47,799 --> 03:29:48,200
Come here.

1907
03:29:49,239 --> 03:29:50,120
Here we go.

1908
03:29:50,120 --> 03:29:51,000
This is what I want you to do.

1909
03:29:51,000 --> 03:29:51,399
Eat that.

1910
03:29:53,049 --> 03:29:53,530
Eat this.

1911
03:29:54,329 --> 03:29:55,819
Take a bite out of that.

1912
03:29:56,620 --> 03:30:00,840
Take a bite out of that.

1913
03:30:05,840 --> 03:30:06,239
Nice.

1914
03:30:06,239 --> 03:30:07,120
All right, now get back in there.

1915
03:30:07,920 --> 03:30:10,079
All right, I need this again.

1916
03:30:10,879 --> 03:30:16,600
What do you mean 1080?

1917
03:30:16,600 --> 03:30:18,540
What's wrong?

1918
03:30:19,340 --> 03:30:19,819
FPS?

1919
03:30:19,819 --> 03:30:20,459
Is it going bad?

1920
03:30:20,459 --> 03:30:20,780
Why?

1921
03:30:20,780 --> 03:30:21,020
What?

1922
03:30:24,360 --> 03:30:24,920
FPS?

1923
03:30:28,920 --> 03:30:29,319
I don't know.

1924
03:30:29,319 --> 03:30:30,120
It's not happening to me.

1925
03:30:30,920 --> 03:30:34,540
Maybe a little.

1926
03:30:35,899 --> 03:30:39,000
Why don't you eat this?

1927
03:30:40,860 --> 03:30:43,600
Eat that.

1928
03:30:43,600 --> 03:30:44,639
You didn't even miss.

1929
03:30:44,639 --> 03:30:45,840
How did you miss biting that?

1930
03:30:46,399 --> 03:30:51,389
The other one just jumped off the cliff.

1931
03:30:53,450 --> 03:30:54,010
You're OK.

1932
03:30:54,010 --> 03:30:54,409
Come here.

1933
03:30:55,370 --> 03:31:02,639
Go for it.

1934
03:31:12,299 --> 03:31:12,540
Yes.

1935
03:31:16,459 --> 03:31:17,020
All right.

1936
03:31:17,579 --> 03:31:20,299
We are now ready to feed them.

1937
03:31:21,389 --> 03:31:23,549
Here's some Hubert fruit.

1938
03:31:24,190 --> 03:31:28,030
Look at all those gems.

1939
03:31:28,750 --> 03:31:30,000
Hell yeah.

1940
03:31:33,709 --> 03:31:34,350
So many gems.

1941
03:31:34,350 --> 03:31:35,469
There's so many.

1942
03:31:35,469 --> 03:31:36,520
Now we need a collector.

1943
03:31:37,079 --> 03:31:40,299
I'm pleased my eyes are burning.

1944
03:31:40,940 --> 03:31:42,750
Take a Tylenol.

1945
03:31:43,309 --> 03:31:45,319
I don't know.

1946
03:31:45,319 --> 03:31:46,360
What do you want to do?

1947
03:31:47,079 --> 03:31:55,479
OK.

1948
03:31:55,479 --> 03:31:56,920
I need to come back here with money.

1949
03:31:57,639 --> 03:31:58,299
Be right back.

1950
03:31:58,860 --> 03:32:01,340
I'll be right back.

1951
03:32:01,340 --> 03:32:02,219
I'll come back with money.

1952
03:32:02,940 --> 03:32:06,569
Tank booster three.

1953
03:32:06,569 --> 03:32:07,049
Holy shit.

1954
03:32:07,049 --> 03:32:07,290
Nice.

1955
03:32:09,979 --> 03:32:10,860
You guys want food?

1956
03:32:10,860 --> 03:32:11,260
You hungry?

1957
03:32:11,979 --> 03:32:26,510
All right.

1958
03:32:26,510 --> 03:32:26,750
Shit.

1959
03:32:27,629 --> 03:32:28,110
Fuck.

1960
03:32:28,110 --> 03:32:32,440
I need to go back to the store.

1961
03:32:32,440 --> 03:32:32,920
I'm not ready yet.

1962
03:32:32,920 --> 03:32:33,799
I need to go with the storage.

1963
03:32:34,360 --> 03:32:35,760
Go feed the big slime.

1964
03:32:36,559 --> 03:32:36,879
Hold on.

1965
03:32:36,879 --> 03:32:37,680
I'm almost done with this.

1966
03:32:37,680 --> 03:32:38,319
Let me get some money.

1967
03:32:41,389 --> 03:32:47,500
Give me a second.

1968
03:32:48,059 --> 03:32:50,219
Hold on.

1969
03:32:50,219 --> 03:32:51,100
One sec.

1970
03:32:51,100 --> 03:33:01,959
Just one sec.

1971
03:33:09,950 --> 03:33:10,350
OK.

1972
03:33:10,350 --> 03:33:10,989
Now I'm...

1973
03:33:20,440 --> 03:33:21,629
I need to make enough money

1974
03:33:21,629 --> 03:33:23,309
where I can have the auto feeder thingy.

1975
03:33:26,600 --> 03:33:28,489
OK.

1976
03:33:28,489 --> 03:33:30,010
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

1977
03:33:31,469 --> 03:33:31,950
Debt check.

1978
03:33:31,950 --> 03:33:32,829
What do you mean debt check?

1979
03:33:33,469 --> 03:33:42,670
Good.

1980
03:33:42,670 --> 03:33:42,909
OK.

1981
03:33:42,909 --> 03:33:43,469
I can afford it.

1982
03:33:44,030 --> 03:33:47,440
Saw debt.

1983
03:33:48,719 --> 03:33:49,440
Oh, shit.

1984
03:33:49,440 --> 03:33:49,840
OK.

1985
03:33:49,840 --> 03:33:50,079
Right.

1986
03:33:53,469 --> 03:33:55,930
Is it 8.2 million?

1987
03:33:55,930 --> 03:33:56,969
Or is it 8 billion?

1988
03:34:03,690 --> 03:34:04,569
8 million.

1989
03:34:07,559 --> 03:34:08,040
Jesus.

1990
03:34:14,750 --> 03:34:15,870
Now I can afford this.

1991
03:34:18,010 --> 03:34:19,129
And now check this out.

1992
03:34:19,690 --> 03:34:20,170
Suck it up.

1993
03:34:22,799 --> 03:34:23,040
Yes.

1994
03:34:24,090 --> 03:34:24,569
Yes.

1995
03:34:24,569 --> 03:34:27,290
Money, money, money, money, money, money, money.

1996
03:34:29,469 --> 03:34:30,190
Oh, yes.

1997
03:34:30,190 --> 03:34:41,530
Money, money, money, money, money, money, money.

1998
03:34:41,530 --> 03:34:42,969
These are worth money.

1999
03:34:42,969 --> 03:34:43,850
These are worth a lot.

2000
03:34:52,250 --> 03:34:53,610
Waiting for a couple more people to eat.

2001
03:34:54,620 --> 03:34:55,100
Delicious.

2002
03:34:56,430 --> 03:34:57,870
Still haven't fed the gray cats.

2003
03:34:58,590 --> 03:34:58,829
What?

2004
03:34:59,389 --> 03:35:02,799
I haven't?

2005
03:35:03,360 --> 03:35:05,260
They don't eat beets.

2006
03:35:05,979 --> 03:35:06,620
Fruit and meat.

2007
03:35:07,180 --> 03:35:08,459
Oh, beet is not fruit.

2008
03:35:09,180 --> 03:35:11,069
Isn't it, though?

2009
03:35:12,430 --> 03:35:13,229
You might get tomato.

2010
03:35:13,229 --> 03:35:14,670
Tomatoes are technically fruit.

2011
03:35:15,389 --> 03:35:20,090
I mean, they're sweet as a fruit.

2012
03:35:20,090 --> 03:35:22,489
There's some sweetness.

2013
03:35:23,290 --> 03:35:24,489
There's sweet as a fruit.

2014
03:35:25,049 --> 03:35:27,579
How the chicken's doing?

2015
03:35:30,479 --> 03:35:32,520
I think there are too many roosters.

2016
03:35:33,760 --> 03:35:34,959
Do I have way too many roosters?

2017
03:35:40,920 --> 03:35:48,059
Hi, guys.

2018
03:35:48,700 --> 03:35:49,500
Veggies and meat.

2019
03:35:52,459 --> 03:35:53,739
Now give me a harvest.

2020
03:35:57,920 --> 03:35:58,399
Delicious.

2021
03:35:58,399 --> 03:35:58,959
Crunchies.

2022
03:36:00,889 --> 03:36:01,290
I mean.

2023
03:36:13,530 --> 03:36:16,799
Or I love when the gems pop up.

2024
03:36:17,520 --> 03:36:19,739
What about how can I not get golden anymore?

2025
03:36:20,700 --> 03:36:26,459
Okay.

2026
03:36:26,459 --> 03:36:26,860
Fruits.

2027
03:36:27,420 --> 03:36:32,940
Golden is just RNG.

2028
03:36:32,940 --> 03:36:33,180
Okay.

2029
03:36:35,629 --> 03:36:41,450
I'm going to get a huge, huge fucking harvest from this.

2030
03:36:41,450 --> 03:36:41,850
Look at this.

2031
03:36:42,729 --> 03:36:43,209
Oh, yeah.

2032
03:36:44,600 --> 03:36:45,319
Oh, yeah.

2033
03:36:45,319 --> 03:36:45,559
Yeah.

2034
03:36:45,559 --> 03:36:45,799
Yeah.

2035
03:36:45,799 --> 03:36:46,440
Oh, yeah.

2036
03:36:46,440 --> 03:36:46,920
Oh, yeah.

2037
03:36:49,229 --> 03:36:50,030
Oh, yeah.

2038
03:36:50,110 --> 03:36:50,510
Look at that.

2039
03:36:52,110 --> 03:36:52,670
Oh, yeah.

2040
03:36:55,950 --> 03:36:56,430
Oh, yeah.

2041
03:37:00,639 --> 03:37:01,680
Keep it coming.

2042
03:37:01,680 --> 03:37:03,280
I have 22 phosphorus to sell.

2043
03:37:09,760 --> 03:37:10,319
Unbelievable.

2044
03:37:10,319 --> 03:37:11,120
I don't want that.

2045
03:37:11,120 --> 03:37:12,399
That's like the scary number.

2046
03:37:13,040 --> 03:37:14,750
I mean, one more.

2047
03:37:15,709 --> 03:37:16,590
Oh, whatever.

2048
03:37:16,590 --> 03:37:25,120
Go Biden raid.

2049
03:37:27,450 --> 03:37:29,760
Wouldn't that be something?

2050
03:37:29,760 --> 03:37:30,159
All right.

2051
03:37:30,159 --> 03:37:31,920
$22 per phosphorus.

2052
03:37:32,879 --> 03:37:33,280
Yes.

2053
03:37:34,090 --> 03:37:34,649
Go for it.

2054
03:37:38,559 --> 03:37:39,360
Give me money.

2055
03:37:40,079 --> 03:37:46,489
Hell, yeah.

2056
03:37:46,489 --> 03:37:49,870
$1,100 now.

2057
03:37:54,909 --> 03:37:55,950
Sell the water?

2058
03:37:55,950 --> 03:37:56,590
Sounds like you can.

2059
03:37:57,229 --> 03:37:59,280
This looks good.

2060
03:38:01,719 --> 03:38:03,399
Now I'm going to go feed that guy.

2061
03:38:10,170 --> 03:38:12,090
Take all of my fruits and vegetables.

2062
03:38:13,290 --> 03:38:18,829
I'm going to feed the hell out of them.

2063
03:38:19,389 --> 03:38:20,670
I'm going to feed them some roosters too.

2064
03:38:20,670 --> 03:38:21,790
We have way too many of these.

2065
03:38:22,590 --> 03:38:27,280
We kind of have to thin this down a little.

2066
03:38:27,280 --> 03:38:28,399
And some of the stony hens.

2067
03:38:34,489 --> 03:38:34,889
Okay.

2068
03:38:34,889 --> 03:38:36,250
That's a little thinned out.

2069
03:38:40,430 --> 03:38:40,670
Okay.

2070
03:38:40,670 --> 03:38:41,149
There we go.

2071
03:38:41,709 --> 03:38:46,270
Let's go feed that guy.

2072
03:38:46,829 --> 03:38:51,440
Pick up fruits and shit on the way.

2073
03:38:54,190 --> 03:38:55,229
I can get it.

2074
03:38:55,229 --> 03:38:55,950
Mine as well.

2075
03:38:56,670 --> 03:39:02,219
I'll take another rooster.

2076
03:39:02,219 --> 03:39:02,540
Fine.

2077
03:39:02,540 --> 03:39:02,780
Sure.

2078
03:39:02,780 --> 03:39:03,340
And another hen.

2079
03:39:03,899 --> 03:39:04,860
Oh, I can't.

2080
03:39:04,860 --> 03:39:05,659
Whatever.

2081
03:39:05,659 --> 03:39:12,680
I come bearing gifts.

2082
03:39:13,399 --> 03:39:15,659
Don't do the buck.

2083
03:39:19,200 --> 03:39:21,549
That's not very good, but I did it anyways.

2084
03:39:22,190 --> 03:39:26,040
Here we go.

2085
03:39:26,040 --> 03:39:26,680
This is the real one.

2086
03:39:26,680 --> 03:39:27,799
This is the one that takes a lot of...

2087
03:39:27,799 --> 03:39:28,280
Here we go.

2088
03:39:28,920 --> 03:39:31,930
It's getting bigger.

2089
03:39:32,489 --> 03:39:33,530
There it is.

2090
03:39:35,469 --> 03:39:37,790
Ooh, a key.

2091
03:39:40,719 --> 03:39:41,840
Don't fall into the ocean.

2092
03:39:44,829 --> 03:39:46,780
What's that?

2093
03:39:49,520 --> 03:39:50,319
I don't need these guys.

2094
03:39:55,600 --> 03:39:56,319
Slime key.

2095
03:40:00,239 --> 03:40:05,610
An ancient key for an ancient lock.

2096
03:40:06,250 --> 03:40:06,649
And another...

2097
03:40:06,649 --> 03:40:07,450
Ooh, a decoration.

2098
03:40:08,170 --> 03:40:13,209
Do I have a key now?

2099
03:40:15,319 --> 03:40:15,719
What?

2100
03:40:20,170 --> 03:40:20,569
Murderer.

2101
03:40:20,569 --> 03:40:21,049
Murderer.

2102
03:40:21,049 --> 03:40:23,209
Guys, they're just little fruit snacks.

2103
03:40:34,409 --> 03:40:36,250
Golden!

2104
03:40:36,250 --> 03:40:36,969
What do I do?

2105
03:40:36,969 --> 03:40:37,290
What do I do?

2106
03:40:37,290 --> 03:40:37,610
Feed it.

2107
03:40:38,840 --> 03:40:39,399
Give me that.

2108
03:40:39,399 --> 03:40:39,959
Don't touch that.

2109
03:40:40,840 --> 03:40:42,040
Everyone get the fuck away from that.

2110
03:40:42,040 --> 03:40:42,600
Don't touch that.

2111
03:40:42,600 --> 03:40:42,920
Don't touch that.

2112
03:40:42,920 --> 03:40:43,399
Don't eat that.

2113
03:40:44,280 --> 03:40:47,719
Got it.

2114
03:40:55,850 --> 03:40:59,040
Nice.

2115
03:40:59,040 --> 03:41:00,079
I got a gold floor.

2116
03:41:00,079 --> 03:41:00,639
I'm going to store it.

2117
03:41:00,639 --> 03:41:01,120
I'm not selling it.

2118
03:41:01,120 --> 03:41:02,239
I'm just going to hold it for a long time.

2119
03:41:03,200 --> 03:41:04,799
What am I going to do with all these hens?

2120
03:41:04,799 --> 03:41:06,719
Okay, now I can use that key.

2121
03:41:07,520 --> 03:41:08,319
Where should I use the key?

2122
03:41:09,040 --> 03:41:20,399
Where should I use the key in that cave?

2123
03:41:24,379 --> 03:41:25,100
Go this way.

2124
03:41:31,200 --> 03:41:31,520
Here.

2125
03:41:33,229 --> 03:41:34,110
Over here.

2126
03:41:34,989 --> 03:41:41,049
A few berries.

2127
03:41:41,610 --> 03:41:46,719
Okay, I have a key now.

2128
03:41:47,280 --> 03:41:48,159
I can use it on this door.

2129
03:41:48,799 --> 03:41:59,149
Isn't there more than one of these present right here?

2130
03:41:59,149 --> 03:41:59,709
Another one.

2131
03:41:59,709 --> 03:42:08,170
Ooh, air drive.

2132
03:42:08,170 --> 03:42:08,649
Oh, cool.

2133
03:42:14,600 --> 03:42:15,799
Well, it's not going to despawn.

2134
03:42:28,780 --> 03:42:29,500
Moss blanket.

2135
03:42:32,459 --> 03:42:33,260
Cool.

2136
03:42:33,260 --> 03:42:45,879
This area is awesome.

2137
03:42:45,879 --> 03:42:46,760
Whoa, wait.

2138
03:42:46,760 --> 03:42:54,479
If I go down there, I'm going to go back.

2139
03:42:54,479 --> 03:42:54,799
Go back.

2140
03:42:54,799 --> 03:42:55,610
Go back.

2141
03:42:55,610 --> 03:42:56,250
Hold on.

2142
03:42:56,250 --> 03:42:56,729
Wait, wait, wait.

2143
03:42:56,729 --> 03:42:57,370
New slimes are here.

2144
03:42:57,370 --> 03:42:58,170
Wait, hold on.

2145
03:42:58,170 --> 03:43:06,200
I don't think I can get out of here.

2146
03:43:06,200 --> 03:43:29,719
What's in there?

2147
03:43:29,719 --> 03:43:32,059
Is it a separate exit?

2148
03:43:32,059 --> 03:43:34,000
Hold on.

2149
03:43:34,000 --> 03:43:39,239
Damn it.

2150
03:43:39,239 --> 03:43:40,520
I need to pick an inventory.

2151
03:43:40,520 --> 03:43:49,799
It's right to the right of the entrance.

2152
03:43:49,799 --> 03:43:50,360
Other way.

2153
03:43:50,360 --> 03:43:59,000
Or is it?

2154
03:44:18,799 --> 03:44:20,079
Try the path instead.

2155
03:44:20,079 --> 03:44:20,639
Is there a path?

2156
03:44:22,079 --> 03:44:23,530
That way.

2157
03:44:23,530 --> 03:44:24,170
Can I go this way?

2158
03:44:24,809 --> 03:44:26,110
Is this right?

2159
03:44:30,489 --> 03:44:31,209
Wait, give me this.

2160
03:44:35,280 --> 03:44:36,700
I got arcane.

2161
03:44:37,420 --> 03:44:40,059
All right.

2162
03:44:40,940 --> 03:44:41,899
This path right here.

2163
03:44:41,899 --> 03:44:42,860
But I can't go up there.

2164
03:44:43,420 --> 03:44:52,639
How do I get up there?

2165
03:44:55,399 --> 03:45:00,969
I'm going to jump around a bit.

2166
03:45:06,600 --> 03:45:08,280
Slime under feet and then jump on them.

2167
03:45:08,280 --> 03:45:14,670
That's a jet pack?

2168
03:45:14,670 --> 03:45:15,709
Yeah, the jet pack sucks.

2169
03:45:16,750 --> 03:45:17,950
You just float in the air.

2170
03:45:17,950 --> 03:45:19,229
You don't actually fly up.

2171
03:45:19,229 --> 03:45:19,950
Watch.

2172
03:45:19,950 --> 03:45:29,229
I have like a level one jet pack.

2173
03:45:29,229 --> 03:45:36,700
I think I can do it from here.

2174
03:45:43,709 --> 03:45:44,190
I got it.

2175
03:45:44,190 --> 03:45:44,510
Okay.

2176
03:45:44,510 --> 03:45:52,379
God damn it.

2177
03:45:52,379 --> 03:45:53,579
I should have carried it with me.

2178
03:45:53,579 --> 03:45:54,540
Wait, I'm carrying it with me.

2179
03:45:55,100 --> 03:46:20,670
Under the bridge, you go up.

2180
03:46:20,670 --> 03:46:22,270
I don't have an inventory space.

2181
03:46:22,270 --> 03:46:22,829
I can't do anything.

2182
03:46:22,829 --> 03:46:23,549
I have to go back.

2183
03:46:23,549 --> 03:46:38,409
Why is everyone so angry?

2184
03:46:38,409 --> 03:46:39,290
Get out of here.

2185
03:46:39,370 --> 03:46:47,600
The water germ with the water.

2186
03:46:47,600 --> 03:46:48,239
What?

2187
03:46:48,239 --> 03:46:51,680
I need to go home.

2188
03:46:51,680 --> 03:47:05,469
I have to go home and sell this shit.

2189
03:47:05,469 --> 03:47:06,590
Is there an inventory upgrade?

2190
03:47:06,590 --> 03:47:07,469
I hope there is.

2191
03:47:07,469 --> 03:47:12,520
Water is its own slot.

2192
03:47:12,520 --> 03:47:12,840
Yeah.

2193
03:47:12,840 --> 03:47:19,870
What are you guys on about?

2194
03:47:19,870 --> 03:47:21,790
Yeah, water is its own slot in the inventory.

2195
03:47:21,790 --> 03:47:23,629
That's why it's a circle and not a cube.

2196
03:47:23,629 --> 03:47:35,479
Chat's wicked zonked.

2197
03:47:35,479 --> 03:47:37,239
Heal brain chat.

2198
03:47:37,239 --> 03:47:38,280
Oh, God.

2199
03:47:38,280 --> 03:47:43,799
Okay, where?

2200
03:47:44,760 --> 03:47:47,440
Store the gold.

2201
03:47:47,440 --> 03:47:49,760
I'm going to wait till it's like $5,000.

2202
03:47:49,760 --> 03:47:53,719
I need to feed people these hens back.

2203
03:47:53,719 --> 03:47:58,040
They don't need them right now.

2204
03:47:58,040 --> 03:47:58,840
Does anybody have a quest?

2205
03:47:59,579 --> 03:48:00,219
There is a call.

2206
03:48:00,219 --> 03:48:00,379
All right.

2207
03:48:00,379 --> 03:48:01,280
What is it?

2208
03:48:01,280 --> 03:48:02,559
No, not not tomorrow morning.

2209
03:48:02,559 --> 03:48:05,360
Let's feed everybody.

2210
03:48:05,360 --> 03:48:10,040
No, we're not.

2211
03:48:10,040 --> 03:48:10,360
I'm going to bed.

2212
03:48:10,360 --> 03:48:11,479
We're going to feed everybody tomorrow morning.

2213
03:48:16,319 --> 03:48:17,440
Are you having fun?

2214
03:48:17,440 --> 03:48:18,479
Yeah, this is amazing.

2215
03:48:19,200 --> 03:48:21,200
Not quite ready yet.

2216
03:48:21,200 --> 03:48:21,360
All right.

2217
03:48:21,360 --> 03:48:22,079
We'll see tomorrow morning.

2218
03:48:34,090 --> 03:48:34,729
Airdrive.

2219
03:48:34,729 --> 03:48:35,930
Enhanced jetpack.

2220
03:48:35,930 --> 03:48:39,629
I mean, that's what I want.

2221
03:48:39,629 --> 03:48:41,149
That's what I was complaining about.

2222
03:48:41,149 --> 03:48:41,870
Tank booster.

2223
03:48:42,860 --> 03:48:43,579
50 units.

2224
03:48:45,760 --> 03:48:46,399
Power core.

2225
03:48:49,370 --> 03:48:50,090
Get the inventory.

2226
03:48:50,090 --> 03:48:50,969
I don't know.

2227
03:48:50,969 --> 03:48:51,610
It's not available.

2228
03:48:52,170 --> 03:49:01,549
I'm going to go to sleep.

2229
03:49:01,549 --> 03:49:07,690
I have a new day.

2230
03:49:07,690 --> 03:49:09,049
Time to get more food.

2231
03:49:09,049 --> 03:49:11,129
Let's feed everybody.

2232
03:49:11,129 --> 03:49:15,159
I'm ready.

2233
03:49:15,159 --> 03:49:24,799
Some of these aren't ready.

2234
03:49:25,440 --> 03:49:27,770
Okay.

2235
03:49:27,770 --> 03:49:29,209
You guys like everything.

2236
03:49:29,209 --> 03:49:30,649
So I'm going to give you the cheap stuff.

2237
03:49:31,290 --> 03:49:33,950
Whatever I can find that's cheap.

2238
03:49:34,590 --> 03:49:37,129
Love you guys.

2239
03:49:37,770 --> 03:49:38,649
Veggies and meat.

2240
03:49:40,559 --> 03:49:41,840
Veggies and meat.

2241
03:49:46,959 --> 03:49:47,360
Thank you.

2242
03:49:48,520 --> 03:49:49,399
You guys eat everything.

2243
03:49:50,940 --> 03:49:52,459
Everything and everything.

2244
03:49:52,459 --> 03:49:56,030
Let's go take care of the guys in the cave.

2245
03:49:56,750 --> 03:49:58,670
Because I think it's only it's fruits, right?

2246
03:49:59,229 --> 03:50:04,030
How many are there in here?

2247
03:50:04,030 --> 03:50:05,549
I feel like I'm doing the jelly bean game.

2248
03:50:05,549 --> 03:50:07,309
We have to count how many are in here and guess.

2249
03:50:08,360 --> 03:50:10,600
One, two, one, two, three, four.

2250
03:50:10,600 --> 03:50:11,479
I don't know.

2251
03:50:11,479 --> 03:50:23,479
Buy an auto feeder.

2252
03:50:23,799 --> 03:50:26,360
Once I make some money from this, we'll take care of that.

2253
03:50:30,760 --> 03:50:32,360
That's a pretty big payday from that.

2254
03:50:32,360 --> 03:50:33,879
That's 36 of these.

2255
03:50:33,879 --> 03:50:34,860
Hell yeah.

2256
03:50:35,739 --> 03:50:42,350
And 36 of these too.

2257
03:50:48,010 --> 03:50:48,809
Nice.

2258
03:50:48,809 --> 03:50:50,879
I will take my fruits back and no one's eating them.

2259
03:50:53,559 --> 03:50:54,440
Other people got to eat.

2260
03:51:02,520 --> 03:51:03,000
Very cool.

2261
03:51:03,559 --> 03:51:06,000
It's been sucked up.

2262
03:51:06,000 --> 03:51:06,239
Good.

2263
03:51:07,040 --> 03:51:09,850
We're going to make another pen.

2264
03:51:10,569 --> 03:51:13,879
Or how about like an incinerator?

2265
03:51:14,520 --> 03:51:16,760
No, I don't think I can just throw people into the ocean.

2266
03:51:18,569 --> 03:51:19,129
The garden?

2267
03:51:21,680 --> 03:51:21,920
Coop?

2268
03:51:26,440 --> 03:51:27,799
The incinerator feels like it doesn't.

2269
03:51:28,360 --> 03:51:29,079
It's not necessary.

2270
03:51:29,819 --> 03:51:30,219
Pond.

2271
03:51:30,219 --> 03:51:31,020
I can make a pond.

2272
03:51:34,489 --> 03:51:35,690
Water is an incinerator.

2273
03:51:36,250 --> 03:51:41,690
Ready?

2274
03:51:42,409 --> 03:51:43,370
Oh, come on.

2275
03:51:43,370 --> 03:51:44,170
They're definitely ready.

2276
03:51:47,229 --> 03:51:48,350
All right, you guys.

2277
03:51:48,350 --> 03:51:49,309
We could feed the rest of you.

2278
03:51:49,309 --> 03:51:49,709
Whatever.

2279
03:51:59,500 --> 03:52:08,190
Eat up.

2280
03:52:08,190 --> 03:52:10,030
Ocean is slime, not water.

2281
03:52:10,030 --> 03:52:10,989
Read the Slimeopedia.

2282
03:52:10,989 --> 03:52:13,579
They love it.

2283
03:52:13,579 --> 03:52:14,540
That's actually pretty interesting.

2284
03:52:18,110 --> 03:52:19,309
I have to be really honest with you guys.

2285
03:52:20,670 --> 03:52:21,709
You guys know me, right?

2286
03:52:23,629 --> 03:52:24,750
Game's holding my interest.

2287
03:52:26,440 --> 03:52:27,479
It's very difficult.

2288
03:52:28,889 --> 03:52:31,950
Um, this is, um, I love this.

2289
03:52:31,950 --> 03:52:32,989
It's like my favorite thing ever.

2290
03:52:34,430 --> 03:52:36,030
I'm going to play the fuck out of this game on stream.

2291
03:52:36,030 --> 03:52:37,389
I just want to make sure everyone's aware of that.

2292
03:52:40,670 --> 03:52:47,309
Give me these.

2293
03:52:47,309 --> 03:52:47,549
More.

2294
03:52:48,829 --> 03:52:56,139
I feel like it's kind of like a Stardew Valley that I get to play and experience again.

2295
03:52:58,959 --> 03:53:03,450
Ooh, those are going up.

2296
03:53:03,450 --> 03:53:03,850
All right.

2297
03:53:03,850 --> 03:53:05,979
I'm 15.

2298
03:53:05,979 --> 03:53:07,340
They were 20 like two days ago.

2299
03:53:08,059 --> 03:53:09,069
Whatever.

2300
03:53:09,069 --> 03:53:28,459
1,500.

2301
03:53:30,170 --> 03:53:30,489
Nice.

2302
03:53:31,389 --> 03:53:32,190
Don't sell the gold.

2303
03:53:33,290 --> 03:53:35,770
You need to diversify your portfolio.

2304
03:53:36,809 --> 03:53:37,049
What?

2305
03:53:37,049 --> 03:53:42,090
You don't mean all, all entire everything into Blue Rock?

2306
03:53:52,909 --> 03:53:54,510
B-L-R-K.

2307
03:53:58,860 --> 03:54:00,379
I don't even know if that's like an actual thing.

2308
03:54:01,260 --> 03:54:02,459
Oh my God.

2309
03:54:02,459 --> 03:54:03,420
Portfolio.

2310
03:54:04,920 --> 03:54:05,959
Plortfolio.

2311
03:54:08,440 --> 03:54:12,600
I just put all my money into Tabby Plort.

2312
03:54:13,239 --> 03:54:18,860
Cool.

2313
03:54:18,860 --> 03:54:19,180
All right.

2314
03:54:19,180 --> 03:54:20,299
So now I can do some upgrades.

2315
03:54:22,620 --> 03:54:26,379
I don't know what you guys are doing in here, but I have nothing to do with this.

2316
03:54:26,940 --> 03:54:27,420
All right.

2317
03:54:27,420 --> 03:54:27,979
What's this call?

2318
03:54:27,979 --> 03:54:28,860
Let's do Mochi.

2319
03:54:29,719 --> 03:54:31,079
Last thing I want to do is make you look bad.

2320
03:54:31,079 --> 03:54:31,639
What do you want?

2321
03:54:33,790 --> 03:54:35,229
You got a fire crystal.

2322
03:54:36,030 --> 03:54:38,200
I don't, I've never even seen one of those.

2323
03:54:38,840 --> 03:54:46,040
I can get three of those and three of those easily, but I need one of these.

2324
03:54:46,040 --> 03:54:47,159
Is that probably a new area?

2325
03:54:47,719 --> 03:54:49,610
All right.

2326
03:54:49,610 --> 03:54:50,250
Everyone's been fed.

2327
03:54:50,250 --> 03:54:50,889
Everyone's good to go.

2328
03:54:50,889 --> 03:54:51,290
We're good.

2329
03:54:52,250 --> 03:54:54,090
I'm just going to, what should I do?

2330
03:54:54,090 --> 03:54:54,809
What should I upgrade?

2331
03:54:55,450 --> 03:54:56,399
Upgrade this.

2332
03:54:57,040 --> 03:54:58,569
Nutrients store.

2333
03:54:58,569 --> 03:55:00,250
Yeah, we're going to get this going.

2334
03:55:00,250 --> 03:55:07,149
And then auto feeders.

2335
03:55:07,149 --> 03:55:07,389
Yes.

2336
03:55:07,790 --> 03:55:11,469
Auto feeders for these guys.

2337
03:55:12,989 --> 03:55:13,709
They eat anything.

2338
03:55:18,989 --> 03:55:19,790
Auto feeder.

2339
03:55:21,440 --> 03:55:21,920
There it is.

2340
03:55:22,479 --> 03:55:24,670
I have to put food into it.

2341
03:55:25,229 --> 03:55:31,469
So there's 15 in there.

2342
03:55:32,639 --> 03:55:33,440
Activate it.

2343
03:55:33,440 --> 03:55:33,840
What is this?

2344
03:55:33,840 --> 03:55:34,639
Slow?

2345
03:55:34,639 --> 03:55:34,959
Medium?

2346
03:55:35,600 --> 03:55:38,350
I wish I could act.

2347
03:55:38,350 --> 03:55:39,549
Does this activate automatically?

2348
03:55:47,100 --> 03:55:48,319
Okay.

2349
03:55:48,319 --> 03:55:49,520
So now I can go to the new area.

2350
03:55:49,520 --> 03:55:52,399
Let me store this though.

2351
03:55:52,399 --> 03:55:53,360
One, two, three, four.

2352
03:55:53,360 --> 03:55:54,079
Excuse me.

2353
03:55:54,079 --> 03:55:54,799
Oh, fuck.

2354
03:55:55,899 --> 03:55:57,020
Oh, fuck.

2355
03:55:57,020 --> 03:55:57,819
I have to pee again.

2356
03:56:00,909 --> 03:56:02,430
I can 100% guarantee you that

2357
03:56:02,430 --> 03:56:03,309
we're playing this the next time

2358
03:56:03,309 --> 03:56:04,110
I stream to get anything.

2359
03:56:04,750 --> 03:56:06,280
This is what we're doing.

2360
03:56:06,280 --> 03:56:07,719
I'm literally playing this.

2361
03:56:08,280 --> 03:56:08,920
Four.

2362
03:56:08,920 --> 03:56:09,879
Pink is worthless now.

2363
03:56:10,520 --> 03:56:13,979
Okay.

2364
03:56:13,979 --> 03:56:15,100
I got an auto feeder set up.

2365
03:56:15,739 --> 03:56:17,440
I'm going to go to the new area.

2366
03:56:18,000 --> 03:56:19,020
First, I'm going to pee.

2367
03:56:19,819 --> 03:56:20,459
I'll be right back.

2368
03:56:21,180 --> 03:56:23,500
Keep going.

2369
03:56:23,500 --> 03:56:25,979
Back to debt.

2370
03:56:26,540 --> 03:56:29,819
Sure.

2371
03:56:29,819 --> 03:56:30,860
And 10 billion?

2372
03:56:31,420 --> 03:56:32,399
10 million?

2373
03:56:38,729 --> 04:01:54,510
I'll be right back.

2374
04:01:54,510 --> 04:01:55,469
I'm eating.

2375
04:01:55,469 --> 04:01:57,069
I'm just sitting here eating.

2376
04:01:57,069 --> 04:01:58,270
Somebody just wrote.

2377
04:01:58,270 --> 04:02:01,370
He's definitely here playing with his wiener.

2378
04:02:05,069 --> 04:02:05,469
He's...

2379
04:02:12,280 --> 04:02:13,239
Oh, my God.

2380
04:02:13,239 --> 04:02:14,280
That's so ridiculous.

2381
04:02:17,079 --> 04:02:18,840
I'm just looking at some of the art.

2382
04:02:18,840 --> 04:02:20,680
Eating like a couple pieces of beef jerky.

2383
04:02:24,350 --> 04:02:26,379
You guys are fucked.

2384
04:02:26,379 --> 04:02:26,620
All right.

2385
04:02:26,620 --> 04:02:27,500
Let's keep going.

2386
04:02:27,500 --> 04:02:29,069
Good stuff as always.

2387
04:02:40,940 --> 04:02:41,500
Okay.

2388
04:02:41,500 --> 04:02:43,530
So I was going to go to the new area.

2389
04:02:45,180 --> 04:02:45,579
I was.

2390
04:02:45,579 --> 04:02:45,819
Yes.

2391
04:02:46,620 --> 04:02:47,100
New area.

2392
04:02:48,059 --> 04:02:51,600
And I need one of these like sauron eyes.

2393
04:02:52,799 --> 04:02:54,319
The rest of that stuff is easy to get.

2394
04:02:54,319 --> 04:02:57,979
I need one sauron eye.

2395
04:03:00,090 --> 04:03:00,409
Okay.

2396
04:03:00,409 --> 04:03:01,129
We're good.

2397
04:03:01,129 --> 04:03:04,639
Is there a fast way I can get there?

2398
04:03:05,120 --> 04:03:07,950
Can I teleport or something?

2399
04:03:07,950 --> 04:03:12,540
What's the best way to get there?

2400
04:03:16,620 --> 04:03:17,579
Do I have to walk?

2401
04:03:17,579 --> 04:03:22,360
Or can I get there from...

2402
04:03:25,200 --> 04:03:26,639
Bring back the sus.

2403
04:03:26,639 --> 04:03:28,639
You'll see it when it's at the break again.

2404
04:03:28,639 --> 04:03:30,350
Just whistle for your horse.

2405
04:03:36,680 --> 04:03:37,399
Walk nerd.

2406
04:03:37,959 --> 04:03:39,479
I didn't know if that was like a fast travel.

2407
04:03:44,120 --> 04:03:48,649
Whoa.

2408
04:03:48,649 --> 04:03:49,290
Whoops.

2409
04:03:49,290 --> 04:03:58,399
Dude, that was a wicked baste.

2410
04:03:58,959 --> 04:04:07,290
Oh, suck up that water.

2411
04:04:14,059 --> 04:04:14,540
Okay.

2412
04:04:14,540 --> 04:04:15,899
The first thing that I see in chat

2413
04:04:18,399 --> 04:04:20,399
is what I'm going to have for dinner.

2414
04:04:22,940 --> 04:04:23,100
No.

2415
04:04:26,780 --> 04:04:27,420
I saw pizza.

2416
04:04:35,079 --> 04:04:36,440
Thankfully, I can pick this up.

2417
04:04:36,440 --> 04:04:37,079
Thankfully.

2418
04:04:37,719 --> 04:04:38,440
I don't even want it.

2419
04:04:43,069 --> 04:04:43,950
I did see pizza.

2420
04:04:44,750 --> 04:04:46,110
But what kind of pizza?

2421
04:04:46,110 --> 04:04:46,909
Poop on pizza.

2422
04:04:46,909 --> 04:04:48,030
Poop and penis.

2423
04:04:48,030 --> 04:04:48,829
Cock on pizza.

2424
04:04:49,709 --> 04:04:50,030
Right.

2425
04:04:50,030 --> 04:04:50,270
Okay.

2426
04:04:50,270 --> 04:04:51,309
But give me a real one.

2427
04:04:58,299 --> 04:04:59,500
I want new slimes.

2428
04:05:01,100 --> 04:05:01,899
New slime.

2429
04:05:01,899 --> 04:05:03,500
They're little like sun hats.

2430
04:05:09,579 --> 04:05:10,459
A puddle slime.

2431
04:05:10,459 --> 04:05:11,180
I want a pond.

2432
04:05:11,899 --> 04:05:12,620
That's priority.

2433
04:05:15,149 --> 04:05:16,110
This is puddle slime.

2434
04:05:16,670 --> 04:05:17,549
Puddle plort.

2435
04:05:17,549 --> 04:05:18,110
Puddle plort.

2436
04:05:18,750 --> 04:05:19,469
Give me.

2437
04:05:19,469 --> 04:05:20,829
I'm going to make a bunch of puddle cats.

2438
04:05:21,790 --> 04:05:33,579
Mushrooms.

2439
04:05:34,680 --> 04:05:35,719
I mean, you got timed out

2440
04:05:35,719 --> 04:05:38,360
because you're just doing absolute all capitals.

2441
04:05:38,360 --> 04:05:49,770
But like you said mushrooms in one pile of puddle plorts.

2442
04:05:51,120 --> 04:05:52,479
Just look at how cute this is.

2443
04:05:52,479 --> 04:05:54,479
It's just like I have my delicious berry.

2444
04:05:57,040 --> 04:05:57,360
Whoa.

2445
04:05:57,920 --> 04:05:59,340
What are these things?

2446
04:06:00,139 --> 04:06:00,940
What the hell are these?

2447
04:06:03,079 --> 04:06:03,719
What is that?

2448
04:06:04,280 --> 04:06:04,920
What do they eat?

2449
04:06:05,559 --> 04:06:08,559
This exploded.

2450
04:06:08,559 --> 04:06:09,280
What did he turn into?

2451
04:06:16,590 --> 04:06:18,270
Margarita pizza chef's kiss.

2452
04:06:21,899 --> 04:06:22,940
Eat him a puddle port.

2453
04:06:25,690 --> 04:06:26,250
Feed him a puddle.

2454
04:06:27,260 --> 04:06:27,979
No, he's going to turn.

2455
04:06:27,979 --> 04:06:29,180
No, no, no, no, no, no.

2456
04:06:29,180 --> 04:06:29,979
I need food.

2457
04:06:29,979 --> 04:06:30,459
What does he eat?

2458
04:06:31,340 --> 04:06:31,979
He eats everything.

2459
04:06:31,979 --> 04:06:33,340
Pink boom Largo.

2460
04:06:44,680 --> 04:06:45,000
Huh?

2461
04:06:47,309 --> 04:06:49,479
And there it is.

2462
04:06:50,360 --> 04:06:51,799
There's the thing I need.

2463
04:06:51,799 --> 04:06:52,760
Oh, there it is.

2464
04:06:52,760 --> 04:06:53,399
Yes.

2465
04:06:53,399 --> 04:06:53,899
Cool.

2466
04:06:56,989 --> 04:06:57,229
All right.

2467
04:06:57,229 --> 04:06:57,729
I need to.

2468
04:06:58,350 --> 04:06:59,149
I'm going to.

2469
04:06:59,149 --> 04:06:59,950
Oh, man.

2470
04:06:59,950 --> 04:07:00,350
There's another.

2471
04:07:01,229 --> 04:07:01,639
Okay.

2472
04:07:01,639 --> 04:07:02,120
Wait a minute.

2473
04:07:02,120 --> 04:07:04,969
I need to go back.

2474
04:07:04,969 --> 04:07:06,250
I need a bunch more of these though.

2475
04:07:06,889 --> 04:07:08,319
I need to.

2476
04:07:09,680 --> 04:07:10,239
You stay.

2477
04:07:10,239 --> 04:07:13,149
Um, stay here.

2478
04:07:14,030 --> 04:07:22,110
What the fuck is that?

2479
04:07:22,110 --> 04:07:23,149
It's an ice cream cat.

2480
04:07:23,950 --> 04:07:26,680
What is that?

2481
04:07:26,680 --> 04:07:26,920
How do I?

2482
04:07:26,920 --> 04:07:27,239
What do I do?

2483
04:07:27,239 --> 04:07:27,719
What do I do?

2484
04:07:28,620 --> 04:07:29,340
No, don't eat that.

2485
04:07:31,000 --> 04:07:31,879
What do I do with this thing?

2486
04:07:31,879 --> 04:07:33,639
What do I do with the ice cream cat?

2487
04:07:33,639 --> 04:07:34,680
What do I do with the ice cream cat?

2488
04:07:34,680 --> 04:07:35,159
What does it want?

2489
04:07:35,159 --> 04:07:35,719
Eat meat.

2490
04:07:35,719 --> 04:07:42,040
Oh, needed meat.

2491
04:07:42,040 --> 04:07:43,079
I don't know how I didn't have any meat.

2492
04:07:43,639 --> 04:07:51,180
What happened to my boom?

2493
04:07:51,739 --> 04:07:55,340
What are the boom lords?

2494
04:07:55,340 --> 04:07:55,979
What happened to them?

2495
04:07:57,450 --> 04:07:58,010
I had two.

2496
04:08:03,680 --> 04:08:04,479
Such a.

2497
04:08:04,479 --> 04:08:06,559
I feel like goddamn the little mermaid.

2498
04:08:07,280 --> 04:08:10,090
I just came to a new place.

2499
04:08:13,260 --> 04:08:15,100
I want to be where the people are.

2500
04:08:16,200 --> 04:08:19,079
Up there where they have the fucking ice cream cats.

2501
04:08:25,719 --> 04:08:26,520
I've never part of this world.

2502
04:08:27,559 --> 04:08:31,420
This is all so new to me.

2503
04:08:31,979 --> 04:08:35,819
Does it follow yarn?

2504
04:08:37,079 --> 04:08:38,200
What the fuck is that?

2505
04:08:39,000 --> 04:08:45,069
And it doesn't she collect forks and shit?

2506
04:08:45,709 --> 04:08:48,270
So yeah, I feel that the exact same way right now.

2507
04:08:48,270 --> 04:08:52,760
Does it have like a human collection?

2508
04:08:59,020 --> 04:08:59,420
Hey, kid.

2509
04:09:00,219 --> 04:09:00,540
Okay.

2510
04:09:12,399 --> 04:09:13,440
Human skin.

2511
04:09:14,079 --> 04:09:21,549
No, not a human skin.

2512
04:09:22,190 --> 04:09:25,000
Oh my God.

2513
04:09:25,000 --> 04:09:27,079
That's a dark fucking Disney movie.

2514
04:09:33,020 --> 04:09:34,780
I want to be where the people are.

2515
04:09:35,420 --> 04:09:37,899
Up there where they're running around and shining.

2516
04:09:38,860 --> 04:09:41,040
Like Buffalo Bill.

2517
04:09:41,920 --> 04:09:44,879
It's got like human body parts down there.

2518
04:09:45,680 --> 04:09:51,819
Give that to me.

2519
04:09:52,379 --> 04:10:00,299
I just lost my entire way.

2520
04:10:00,299 --> 04:10:01,260
Wait, I made it up.

2521
04:10:01,260 --> 04:10:01,579
Okay.

2522
04:10:02,459 --> 04:10:06,200
Hey, what's that?

2523
04:10:06,840 --> 04:10:17,879
Just at some one point she starts like dancing around with a skeleton.

2524
04:10:19,770 --> 04:10:21,290
Part of your world.

2525
04:10:22,409 --> 04:10:31,280
All right.

2526
04:10:31,280 --> 04:10:32,319
Give me out of here.

2527
04:10:32,319 --> 04:10:52,969
Oh, definitely watched the little mermaid like yesterday.

2528
04:10:52,969 --> 04:10:53,930
I know I didn't.

2529
04:10:55,610 --> 04:11:01,879
I can't believe I didn't get a chance to take the ice cream cat.

2530
04:11:01,879 --> 04:11:02,680
I'm so mad.

2531
04:11:03,719 --> 04:11:10,430
So what should I do with this yarn?

2532
04:11:10,430 --> 04:11:11,229
Give it to one of the cats.

2533
04:11:25,079 --> 04:11:25,399
Yes.

2534
04:11:27,399 --> 04:11:27,719
Yes.

2535
04:11:28,600 --> 04:11:30,139
Give it to one of the cats.

2536
04:11:30,139 --> 04:11:30,379
Yes.

2537
04:11:31,420 --> 04:11:32,379
Why are you doing that?

2538
04:11:34,719 --> 04:11:45,500
Why are you guys doing that?

2539
04:11:45,500 --> 04:11:46,139
All right.

2540
04:11:46,139 --> 04:11:49,899
I have now some very interesting things going on.

2541
04:11:50,860 --> 04:11:53,040
First of all, put this down.

2542
04:11:55,020 --> 04:11:58,540
I'm going to get seven chickens, six melon drinks.

2543
04:11:58,540 --> 04:11:59,579
I'm going to get a lot of stuff here.

2544
04:11:59,579 --> 04:12:00,379
Hold on.

2545
04:12:00,379 --> 04:12:06,479
Let's deposit this little plorts.

2546
04:12:06,479 --> 04:12:06,879
Hold on.

2547
04:12:07,520 --> 04:12:10,459
The room will fail with yes.

2548
04:12:15,739 --> 04:12:16,379
You dick.

2549
04:12:29,520 --> 04:12:30,319
Who's eating?

2550
04:12:30,319 --> 04:12:31,360
Are you guys getting auto fed?

2551
04:12:32,319 --> 04:12:33,879
Only three left.

2552
04:12:33,879 --> 04:12:34,040
All right.

2553
04:12:34,040 --> 04:12:35,319
Well, here you guys just eat these.

2554
04:12:43,840 --> 04:12:44,079
Okay.

2555
04:12:44,719 --> 04:12:44,879
Now.

2556
04:12:46,010 --> 04:12:46,569
Yep.

2557
04:12:46,569 --> 04:12:47,049
Okay.

2558
04:12:47,049 --> 04:12:47,610
Cool.

2559
04:12:47,610 --> 04:12:51,530
You need rocks and light bulbs.

2560
04:12:52,250 --> 04:12:53,930
I thought he was talking to chat.

2561
04:12:54,489 --> 04:12:56,139
I thought he was talking to chat.

2562
04:13:03,930 --> 04:13:04,729
This dude is crazy.

2563
04:13:04,729 --> 04:13:06,569
Was he talking to chat or was he talking to himself?

2564
04:13:06,569 --> 04:13:07,610
Is this guy nuts?

2565
04:13:14,729 --> 04:13:27,870
No, I don't have enough room.

2566
04:13:33,559 --> 04:13:34,280
Let's put these.

2567
04:13:34,280 --> 04:13:35,319
I need to put a couple in here.

2568
04:13:42,780 --> 04:13:43,020
Shit.

2569
04:13:43,659 --> 04:13:44,139
Shit.

2570
04:13:44,139 --> 04:13:44,540
Shit.

2571
04:13:44,540 --> 04:13:44,940
Shit.

2572
04:13:44,940 --> 04:13:45,340
Shit.

2573
04:13:45,340 --> 04:13:45,739
Shit.

2574
04:13:45,739 --> 04:13:46,059
Shit.

2575
04:13:46,059 --> 04:13:46,459
Shit.

2576
04:13:46,459 --> 04:13:46,700
Shit.

2577
04:13:46,700 --> 04:13:46,860
Shit.

2578
04:13:46,860 --> 04:13:47,340
What do I do?

2579
04:13:48,219 --> 04:13:48,780
Shit.

2580
04:13:48,780 --> 04:13:49,979
Say I sell them.

2581
04:13:49,979 --> 04:13:50,219
Shit.

2582
04:13:50,860 --> 04:13:56,940
Wait, do I want a rock puddle?

2583
04:13:57,500 --> 04:14:05,469
I might want a rock puddle.

2584
04:14:06,190 --> 04:14:08,680
Oh, that's dumb.

2585
04:14:15,659 --> 04:14:26,829
What happened?

2586
04:14:26,829 --> 04:14:27,469
Puddle cat.

2587
04:14:28,110 --> 04:14:30,299
Could it be a puddle cat?

2588
04:14:30,299 --> 04:14:43,469
Puddle cat.

2589
04:14:44,030 --> 04:14:45,770
Puddle slimes can't mix.

2590
04:14:46,969 --> 04:14:50,399
Boom puddle or riot.

2591
04:14:51,040 --> 04:14:53,549
Puddle cat is a great username.

2592
04:14:54,270 --> 04:14:56,489
Boom puddle.

2593
04:14:56,489 --> 04:14:57,049
Boom puddle.

2594
04:14:58,700 --> 04:14:59,819
But you can't mix.

2595
04:14:59,819 --> 04:15:00,299
You can't?

2596
04:15:02,409 --> 04:15:03,290
Boom puddle.

2597
04:15:03,290 --> 04:15:03,610
All right.

2598
04:15:03,610 --> 04:15:04,489
I'll do boom puddle.

2599
04:15:06,010 --> 04:15:06,969
But first, I've got to...

2600
04:15:06,969 --> 04:15:07,370
All right.

2601
04:15:07,370 --> 04:15:08,170
I'm getting overwhelmed.

2602
04:15:08,809 --> 04:15:09,610
Put this in the cat.

2603
04:15:10,649 --> 04:15:11,370
Give this to the cat.

2604
04:15:11,370 --> 04:15:12,090
Give the cats this.

2605
04:15:12,090 --> 04:15:12,809
They're going to love this.

2606
04:15:16,670 --> 04:15:16,909
All right.

2607
04:15:16,909 --> 04:15:17,549
Don't all...

2608
04:15:17,549 --> 04:15:18,430
You attack it at once.

2609
04:15:18,430 --> 04:15:18,670
All right.

2610
04:15:18,670 --> 04:15:19,229
I need a puddle.

2611
04:15:19,790 --> 04:15:27,500
Puddle is what?

2612
04:15:27,500 --> 04:15:27,899
500?

2613
04:15:28,700 --> 04:15:31,629
I think it's 500.

2614
04:15:31,629 --> 04:15:37,000
How many chickens do I have?

2615
04:15:37,000 --> 04:15:37,559
Way too many.

2616
04:15:37,559 --> 04:15:38,520
There's only one rooster.

2617
04:15:38,520 --> 04:15:39,000
What happened?

2618
04:15:40,329 --> 04:15:42,170
This one rooster is doing all this?

2619
04:15:44,840 --> 04:15:45,159
Damn.

2620
04:15:47,579 --> 04:15:47,819
Okay.

2621
04:15:50,239 --> 04:15:51,200
I need just three of the...

2622
04:15:51,200 --> 04:15:51,600
Okay.

2623
04:15:51,600 --> 04:15:52,000
Let's go.

2624
04:16:02,040 --> 04:16:03,479
You eat veggies and meat.

2625
04:16:03,479 --> 04:16:04,600
You don't eat berries.

2626
04:16:05,479 --> 04:16:06,200
God damn it.

2627
04:16:06,920 --> 04:16:11,000
Let's give it back.

2628
04:16:12,559 --> 04:16:14,059
Give it back.

2629
04:16:15,100 --> 04:16:17,500
I want to stop hurting each other.

2630
04:16:24,639 --> 04:16:26,159
Give me back those berries.

2631
04:16:27,200 --> 04:16:30,559
I need some supplies.

2632
04:16:32,430 --> 04:16:33,149
Fruits and meat.

2633
04:16:33,149 --> 04:16:33,389
All right.

2634
04:16:33,389 --> 04:16:34,190
I want to get them from here.

2635
04:16:35,629 --> 04:16:43,959
Tuck it up.

2636
04:16:43,959 --> 04:16:54,379
Berries or...

2637
04:16:54,379 --> 04:16:54,860
Berries.

2638
04:16:55,579 --> 04:16:56,600
They're the same thing.

2639
04:16:59,319 --> 04:17:02,430
That's a big harvest.

2640
04:17:10,110 --> 04:17:10,590
Cool.

2641
04:17:10,590 --> 04:17:11,950
So, pond.

2642
04:17:12,670 --> 04:17:13,469
Pond.

2643
04:17:13,469 --> 04:17:14,430
What are you going to do with this?

2644
04:17:14,989 --> 04:17:15,709
Let's find out.

2645
04:17:16,590 --> 04:17:17,149
Activate it.

2646
04:17:19,000 --> 04:17:19,479
All right.

2647
04:17:19,479 --> 04:17:20,840
So, puddle slime.

2648
04:17:32,430 --> 04:17:33,309
They eat water.

2649
04:17:33,870 --> 04:17:39,770
Are these guys shitting anything out?

2650
04:17:40,409 --> 04:17:41,049
They actually...

2651
04:17:41,049 --> 04:17:42,010
Can I get anything from them?

2652
04:17:45,020 --> 04:17:46,219
They're so happy.

2653
04:17:46,219 --> 04:17:47,659
They love the puddle slime.

2654
04:18:01,100 --> 04:18:01,420
I don't know.

2655
04:18:01,420 --> 04:18:05,000
I feel like this is like an exhibit at an art studio

2656
04:18:05,000 --> 04:18:05,959
or a mall or something.

2657
04:18:05,959 --> 04:18:08,840
There's a bunch of people that just want to come in and see so badly this.

2658
04:18:08,840 --> 04:18:09,639
It's like a zoo.

2659
04:18:12,299 --> 04:18:13,180
We're not open yet.

2660
04:18:13,739 --> 04:18:15,319
Are they hungry?

2661
04:18:15,319 --> 04:18:16,120
They want to eat this?

2662
04:18:17,000 --> 04:18:18,799
Do the Meatwad voice.

2663
04:18:18,799 --> 04:18:19,120
Okay.

2664
04:18:20,239 --> 04:18:22,479
What are you talking about, Silk?

2665
04:18:22,479 --> 04:18:23,840
I don't even want to do that, Silk.

2666
04:18:25,610 --> 04:18:29,049
Meatwad, I think that sometimes an idiot like you

2667
04:18:29,049 --> 04:18:30,489
needs to be slapped in the face.

2668
04:18:31,479 --> 04:18:32,280
So, I'm going to.

2669
04:18:32,840 --> 04:18:46,889
Go down here.

2670
04:18:46,889 --> 04:18:47,690
Now, Frylock.

2671
04:18:47,690 --> 04:18:48,649
I can't do Frylock.

2672
04:18:48,649 --> 04:18:49,530
What's going on in here?

2673
04:18:50,250 --> 04:18:52,409
I did the same fucking joke.

2674
04:18:52,489 --> 04:18:54,489
Like six months ago.

2675
04:18:54,489 --> 04:18:56,329
I did this six months ago.

2676
04:18:56,329 --> 04:18:57,930
Stop pulling it back.

2677
04:18:57,930 --> 04:18:58,969
I did this already.

2678
04:18:58,969 --> 04:18:59,930
This exact same thing.

2679
04:18:59,930 --> 04:19:01,530
I did the what's going on in here.

2680
04:19:03,079 --> 04:19:03,799
Shoot the water?

2681
04:19:07,290 --> 04:19:07,930
They don't like that.

2682
04:19:08,809 --> 04:19:11,159
Does he like that?

2683
04:19:11,799 --> 04:19:16,959
Okay.

2684
04:19:16,959 --> 04:19:17,520
Well, we got that.

2685
04:19:17,520 --> 04:19:17,760
Cool.

2686
04:19:18,319 --> 04:19:19,680
Are you guys having fun over here?

2687
04:19:20,319 --> 04:19:21,690
You guys having fun?

2688
04:19:27,000 --> 04:19:27,319
Okay.

2689
04:19:27,879 --> 04:19:28,760
Let's go get our haul.

2690
04:19:31,079 --> 04:19:31,719
Save the earth.

2691
04:19:31,719 --> 04:19:33,000
Recycle jokes.

2692
04:19:33,000 --> 04:19:35,389
It's true.

2693
04:19:44,000 --> 04:19:44,319
All right.

2694
04:19:44,319 --> 04:19:45,920
I have enough space for this.

2695
04:19:45,920 --> 04:19:48,000
We're just going to go one, two, three.

2696
04:19:48,239 --> 04:19:48,639
Bingo.

2697
04:19:52,440 --> 04:19:53,879
So, what are these like fruits?

2698
04:19:53,879 --> 04:19:54,520
These new fruits?

2699
04:19:55,159 --> 04:19:56,879
I've never seen these before.

2700
04:20:03,370 --> 04:20:03,850
What's in there?

2701
04:20:04,489 --> 04:20:08,559
What are these?

2702
04:20:09,840 --> 04:20:10,959
Mint mangoes.

2703
04:20:11,520 --> 04:20:12,079
Interesting.

2704
04:20:13,920 --> 04:20:16,000
Intensely sweet with a cool minty finish.

2705
04:20:16,719 --> 04:20:18,000
Who eats these?

2706
04:20:38,809 --> 04:20:39,209
Cool.

2707
04:20:39,209 --> 04:20:40,090
I have a thousand bucks.

2708
04:20:40,649 --> 04:20:43,129
Can I upgrade this thing?

2709
04:20:44,639 --> 04:20:45,600
Additional storage.

2710
04:20:46,159 --> 04:20:47,360
Up to four ports.

2711
04:20:48,250 --> 04:20:48,969
I want it.

2712
04:20:48,969 --> 04:20:49,370
I do.

2713
04:20:50,170 --> 04:20:50,989
Okay.

2714
04:20:50,989 --> 04:20:51,870
So, what do I do?

2715
04:20:51,870 --> 04:20:52,430
Can I do?

2716
04:20:56,989 --> 04:20:58,360
Hmm.

2717
04:20:58,360 --> 04:20:59,799
I cannot give this to a slime.

2718
04:21:06,489 --> 04:21:08,969
Well, I mean a slime as in the puddle slime.

2719
04:21:08,969 --> 04:21:10,090
Can I not give this to a puddle?

2720
04:21:10,649 --> 04:21:11,879
I kind of want to try it.

2721
04:21:27,879 --> 04:21:31,239
Oh, what's the point of these guys?

2722
04:21:31,879 --> 04:21:33,200
I just spent...

2723
04:21:34,159 --> 04:21:38,729
Oh, oops.

2724
04:21:44,920 --> 04:21:45,799
Get in the water.

2725
04:21:48,379 --> 04:21:48,860
Get in the...

2726
04:21:50,860 --> 04:21:51,420
No, I want...

2727
04:21:53,180 --> 04:21:59,450
Where'd that go?

2728
04:21:59,450 --> 04:22:02,190
Where did it go?

2729
04:22:02,190 --> 04:22:03,229
Where did it go?

2730
04:22:03,229 --> 04:22:03,790
Where did it go?

2731
04:22:04,989 --> 04:22:05,629
Where did it go?

2732
04:22:06,270 --> 04:22:15,049
Did it fall through the crack?

2733
04:22:17,930 --> 04:22:18,809
No, thank God.

2734
04:22:18,809 --> 04:22:20,250
I was going to say that would be so annoying.

2735
04:22:21,129 --> 04:22:21,850
Okay.

2736
04:22:21,850 --> 04:22:22,889
So, I get it.

2737
04:22:22,889 --> 04:22:24,809
They produce puddle ports.

2738
04:22:27,819 --> 04:22:29,579
I want to make boom something.

2739
04:22:32,569 --> 04:22:32,809
All right.

2740
04:22:32,809 --> 04:22:33,690
What else do I want down here?

2741
04:22:34,250 --> 04:22:37,469
I'm going to make another one.

2742
04:22:38,350 --> 04:22:39,069
Make a boom cat.

2743
04:22:39,069 --> 04:22:39,309
All right.

2744
04:22:39,309 --> 04:22:40,989
I'm going to make a boom cat in here.

2745
04:22:40,989 --> 04:23:03,120
You don't want it?

2746
04:23:03,120 --> 04:23:05,819
Cool.

2747
04:23:05,819 --> 04:23:06,459
Likes meat.

2748
04:23:10,559 --> 04:23:11,040
Cool.

2749
04:23:12,520 --> 04:23:12,840
Okay.

2750
04:23:15,819 --> 04:23:16,620
I want to keep you in here.

2751
04:23:16,620 --> 04:23:17,659
I don't want you to fly out.

2752
04:23:17,659 --> 04:23:21,469
You're not going to fly out, right?

2753
04:23:21,469 --> 04:23:23,920
You eat meat.

2754
04:23:23,920 --> 04:23:24,159
Okay.

2755
04:23:24,159 --> 04:23:27,260
What is meat in this game?

2756
04:23:27,260 --> 04:23:29,790
I feel like I've seen fruits, vegetables.

2757
04:23:29,790 --> 04:23:30,829
Is there like a meat?

2758
04:23:30,829 --> 04:23:32,190
Like you have like chickens, right?

2759
04:23:32,829 --> 04:23:37,120
Is there something else besides chicken or rooster?

2760
04:23:45,049 --> 04:23:45,530
No.

2761
04:23:45,530 --> 04:23:49,399
I want to test it.

2762
04:23:49,399 --> 04:24:00,299
Here you go.

2763
04:24:00,299 --> 04:24:02,059
Eat that and let me give it some boom.

2764
04:24:02,780 --> 04:24:06,200
You all right?

2765
04:24:06,200 --> 04:24:12,250
Eat this guy.

2766
04:24:12,250 --> 04:24:13,129
He's scrumptious.

2767
04:24:17,959 --> 04:24:18,680
Eat this guy.

2768
04:24:19,319 --> 04:24:20,969
There you go.

2769
04:24:20,969 --> 04:24:21,370
And...

2770
04:24:24,270 --> 04:24:25,229
That's too...

2771
04:24:25,229 --> 04:24:26,909
And we can just keep making them.

2772
04:24:26,909 --> 04:24:27,469
I need to...

2773
04:24:27,469 --> 04:24:28,110
Wait.

2774
04:24:28,110 --> 04:24:48,059
Jeez, let's get the shit out of me.

2775
04:24:48,059 --> 04:24:50,799
I don't know why.

2776
04:24:50,799 --> 04:24:51,760
Re-boom cats.

2777
04:24:51,760 --> 04:24:52,879
Now we're going to...

2778
04:24:54,989 --> 04:24:55,709
I need a ceiling.

2779
04:24:55,709 --> 04:24:56,350
Yeah, I know.

2780
04:24:56,350 --> 04:24:57,389
I need a ceiling right now.

2781
04:24:58,649 --> 04:24:59,049
I need to...

2782
04:24:59,930 --> 04:25:00,329
Stay there.

2783
04:25:00,329 --> 04:25:00,729
I got...

2784
04:25:00,729 --> 04:25:01,770
I'm working on it.

2785
04:25:10,750 --> 04:25:11,309
I'm working on it.

2786
04:25:11,309 --> 04:25:11,870
I'm working on it.

2787
04:25:11,870 --> 04:25:12,430
I'm working on it.

2788
04:25:12,430 --> 04:25:13,149
I'm working on it.

2789
04:25:13,149 --> 04:25:13,870
I'm working on it.

2790
04:25:15,049 --> 04:25:15,450
I need...

2791
04:25:15,450 --> 04:25:16,090
I'm working on it.

2792
04:25:16,090 --> 04:25:17,129
How much of the puddles go for?

2793
04:25:17,129 --> 04:25:17,690
57.

2794
04:25:18,329 --> 04:25:20,440
I'm working on it.

2795
04:25:37,000 --> 04:25:37,239
Okay.

2796
04:25:41,559 --> 04:25:42,360
I'm working on it.

2797
04:25:42,360 --> 04:25:42,920
I'm working on it.

2798
04:25:46,959 --> 04:25:48,159
Auto feeder is empty.

2799
04:25:48,159 --> 04:25:49,040
Fill it with heartbeats.

2800
04:25:53,079 --> 04:25:54,239
Okay.

2801
04:25:54,239 --> 04:25:54,479
Here.

2802
04:25:57,500 --> 04:25:58,940
Okay.

2803
04:25:58,940 --> 04:25:59,500
Fruits.

2804
04:25:59,500 --> 04:26:00,700
You guys like fruit?

2805
04:26:00,700 --> 04:26:02,620
Oh, fuck you.

2806
04:26:02,620 --> 04:26:02,940
I want...

2807
04:26:02,940 --> 04:26:03,260
Go in.

2808
04:26:06,360 --> 04:26:08,799
I'm trying to get money.

2809
04:26:09,440 --> 04:26:10,889
How did you get out?

2810
04:26:16,399 --> 04:26:17,680
You don't eat fruits.

2811
04:26:28,399 --> 04:26:29,559
The thriller.

2812
04:26:36,319 --> 04:26:48,440
I can't take a phone call right now.

2813
04:26:48,440 --> 04:26:49,870
I need more chickens.

2814
04:26:57,079 --> 04:26:57,319
Okay.

2815
04:26:58,600 --> 04:27:00,280
Collect it.

2816
04:27:02,319 --> 04:27:03,200
Sell everything.

2817
04:27:03,920 --> 04:27:04,809
How did you get out?

2818
04:27:05,370 --> 04:27:06,250
Where are you even from?

2819
04:27:08,090 --> 04:27:11,799
How did you get out of here?

2820
04:27:12,440 --> 04:27:14,200
You came all the way over here.

2821
04:27:14,920 --> 04:27:18,430
I need to put a goddamn lid on this place.

2822
04:27:19,389 --> 04:27:19,709
No.

2823
04:27:19,709 --> 04:27:20,110
I...

2824
04:27:20,110 --> 04:27:21,389
But these guys are less valuable.

2825
04:27:21,389 --> 04:27:21,790
I don't care.

2826
04:27:24,600 --> 04:27:24,840
All right.

2827
04:27:24,840 --> 04:27:25,079
I got...

2828
04:27:27,799 --> 04:27:28,200
Hold on.

2829
04:27:29,600 --> 04:27:29,760
I...

2830
04:27:31,200 --> 04:27:44,840
Eat these.

2831
04:27:53,469 --> 04:27:53,870
Thank you.

2832
04:28:08,569 --> 04:28:08,809
Eat.

2833
04:28:09,450 --> 04:28:15,290
I need you to eat those.

2834
04:28:15,930 --> 04:28:17,069
Come on, Tabby.

2835
04:28:17,709 --> 04:28:19,959
Come on, Tabby.

2836
04:28:19,959 --> 04:28:20,280
Eat.

2837
04:28:28,510 --> 04:28:28,829
Eat.

2838
04:28:33,420 --> 04:28:33,659
You don't...

2839
04:28:33,659 --> 04:28:33,819
You...

2840
04:28:34,940 --> 04:28:40,159
There's so much opportunity for you.

2841
04:28:45,120 --> 04:28:45,520
Thank you.

2842
04:28:46,079 --> 04:28:53,530
You're long enough.

2843
04:28:53,530 --> 04:28:53,930
One more.

2844
04:28:53,930 --> 04:28:54,409
Where are they?

2845
04:28:54,969 --> 04:28:55,770
All right.

2846
04:28:55,770 --> 04:28:56,569
We're good.

2847
04:28:56,569 --> 04:28:57,209
Excellent.

2848
04:28:57,209 --> 04:28:57,850
Boom, cats.

2849
04:29:04,649 --> 04:29:05,209
Good?

2850
04:29:05,209 --> 04:29:05,690
Looks good.

2851
04:29:05,690 --> 04:29:06,010
Awesome.

2852
04:29:08,649 --> 04:29:10,280
Looks good.

2853
04:29:11,079 --> 04:29:12,040
Put some chickens in here.

2854
04:29:12,920 --> 04:29:14,729
I'm gonna sell these.

2855
04:29:14,729 --> 04:29:15,850
Yeah, this ain't worth a lot of money.

2856
04:29:16,889 --> 04:29:19,879
One of them escaped.

2857
04:29:19,879 --> 04:29:20,120
Where?

2858
04:29:20,840 --> 04:29:24,569
Nobody escaped.

2859
04:29:24,569 --> 04:29:27,209
The Tabby flew away?

2860
04:29:27,850 --> 04:29:39,360
What?

2861
04:29:39,360 --> 04:29:53,579
I saw it too.

2862
04:29:53,579 --> 04:29:53,899
Really?

2863
04:29:54,860 --> 04:29:57,360
Okay.

2864
04:29:57,360 --> 04:29:59,040
I can't quite get that now.

2865
04:30:00,079 --> 04:30:00,319
Cool.

2866
04:30:00,319 --> 04:30:01,520
Let's come back with some chickens.

2867
04:30:02,239 --> 04:30:06,040
And then I'm gonna sell these

2868
04:30:06,040 --> 04:30:07,639
and get a lot of money for the boom plorts.

2869
04:30:10,840 --> 04:30:16,430
How much do they go for?

2870
04:30:18,170 --> 04:30:19,770
58 a pop.

2871
04:30:20,409 --> 04:30:23,850
Cool.

2872
04:30:23,850 --> 04:30:24,489
All right.

2873
04:30:24,489 --> 04:30:32,110
Let's go.

2874
04:30:45,079 --> 04:30:46,600
And here we go.

2875
04:30:46,600 --> 04:30:47,239
Throw them in here.

2876
04:30:47,799 --> 04:30:48,700
Eat up.

2877
04:30:48,700 --> 04:30:50,059
I want more of those boom plorts.

2878
04:30:50,620 --> 04:30:58,540
How much is it for an auto...

2879
04:31:00,059 --> 04:31:00,459
Air net.

2880
04:31:00,459 --> 04:31:01,020
That's what I want.

2881
04:31:01,659 --> 04:31:09,680
Eat up.

2882
04:31:09,680 --> 04:31:17,979
Any more?

2883
04:31:17,979 --> 04:31:18,780
Good.

2884
04:31:18,780 --> 04:31:20,729
Slimes are so cute.

2885
04:31:20,729 --> 04:31:21,370
They really are.

2886
04:31:21,930 --> 04:31:24,000
Hey, this game's awesome.

2887
04:31:24,639 --> 04:31:27,739
I had no idea this was a gem collecting stock market game.

2888
04:31:28,540 --> 04:31:30,409
I honestly thought this was Pokemon.

2889
04:31:30,409 --> 04:31:31,450
I thought it was a Pokemon game.

2890
04:31:32,329 --> 04:31:41,760
Okay, we're good.

2891
04:31:41,760 --> 04:31:42,559
Everyone's locked in.

2892
04:31:43,280 --> 04:31:44,000
They've been fed.

2893
04:31:44,559 --> 04:31:46,639
I got a lot of boom plorts to sell.

2894
04:31:46,639 --> 04:31:47,040
Let's go.

2895
04:31:56,879 --> 04:31:58,559
I actually might make enough money to come put a net on.

2896
04:32:00,559 --> 04:32:01,280
I think we're doing that.

2897
04:32:01,280 --> 04:32:02,159
I'm coming to put a net on.

2898
04:32:02,799 --> 04:32:12,559
That is wrong.

2899
04:32:12,559 --> 04:32:13,120
I love this game.

2900
04:32:13,120 --> 04:32:14,000
These slimes are so cute.

2901
04:32:14,000 --> 04:32:14,399
Wait, what?

2902
04:32:17,930 --> 04:32:18,889
Sell the bloom.

2903
04:32:18,889 --> 04:32:19,610
Boom plorts.

2904
04:32:20,569 --> 04:32:21,209
Make some money.

2905
04:32:33,629 --> 04:32:34,989
1,400 bucks.

2906
04:32:37,129 --> 04:32:39,129
I think it's time to upgrade my body.

2907
04:32:40,860 --> 04:32:41,899
Tank booster.

2908
04:32:41,899 --> 04:32:42,620
50.

2909
04:32:42,620 --> 04:32:42,940
Yep.

2910
04:32:44,840 --> 04:32:45,559
Dash boots.

2911
04:32:46,120 --> 04:32:47,360
Let's get them.

2912
04:32:55,680 --> 04:32:56,479
Did I get raided?

2913
04:32:57,120 --> 04:32:57,520
I did.

2914
04:32:58,489 --> 04:32:59,290
I don't see a raid.

2915
04:33:00,489 --> 04:33:01,290
I missed a raid.

2916
04:33:02,010 --> 04:33:04,810
I don't see it on any dashboard or anything.

2917
04:33:05,369 --> 04:33:07,610
I missed it.

2918
04:33:07,610 --> 04:33:08,009
What was it?

2919
04:33:08,009 --> 04:33:08,569
Who was it?

2920
04:33:11,720 --> 04:33:12,759
I got two dashboards open.

2921
04:33:12,759 --> 04:33:13,400
I don't see anything.

2922
04:33:15,450 --> 04:33:16,330
Bob is all I...

2923
04:33:16,330 --> 04:33:16,970
Bob chickens.

2924
04:33:18,840 --> 04:33:20,200
Two and then one.

2925
04:33:21,799 --> 04:33:22,200
Easy.

2926
04:33:31,799 --> 04:33:36,159
He wants an old one?

2927
04:33:36,159 --> 04:33:37,599
He wants two elder roosters?

2928
04:33:38,159 --> 04:33:43,389
Oh, no.

2929
04:33:43,389 --> 04:33:44,029
What does he want?

2930
04:33:44,669 --> 04:33:46,040
That's different.

2931
04:33:46,040 --> 04:33:46,599
What is that one?

2932
04:33:47,319 --> 04:33:50,319
I don't think I have any of those.

2933
04:33:50,880 --> 04:33:55,209
The briar hen.

2934
04:33:55,209 --> 04:33:56,009
Oh, shit.

2935
04:33:56,009 --> 04:33:56,650
I don't have one.

2936
04:33:57,740 --> 04:33:58,299
Okay, well.

2937
04:33:59,020 --> 04:33:59,900
Oh, whatever.

2938
04:34:00,459 --> 04:34:04,799
I think I'm ready to go back and explore that area.

2939
04:34:10,959 --> 04:34:12,240
I have two briar.

2940
04:34:12,240 --> 04:34:13,279
So it's the red hens.

2941
04:34:13,279 --> 04:34:13,759
It's red?

2942
04:34:16,459 --> 04:34:17,180
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

2943
04:34:17,180 --> 04:34:17,659
I got to...

2944
04:34:17,659 --> 04:34:18,060
Hold on.

2945
04:34:22,650 --> 04:34:24,090
There's so much to do.

2946
04:34:24,090 --> 04:34:25,849
There's too much stuff to do.

2947
04:34:26,990 --> 04:34:42,880
Put glasses on.

2948
04:34:43,439 --> 04:34:45,630
Somebody escaped?

2949
04:34:46,270 --> 04:34:48,729
All right.

2950
04:34:48,729 --> 04:34:49,369
These are puddle.

2951
04:34:50,409 --> 04:34:50,729
Gold.

2952
04:34:52,090 --> 04:34:53,130
I'm gonna put the mangoes in here

2953
04:34:53,130 --> 04:34:54,090
because I don't really know what to do with them.

2954
04:34:54,090 --> 04:34:54,650
It's just a good...

2955
04:34:54,650 --> 04:34:55,450
Like a better food.

2956
04:34:56,250 --> 04:34:57,259
And we'll feed...

2957
04:34:57,259 --> 04:34:58,700
We'll put the heartbeats in the heartbeat container.

2958
04:34:59,259 --> 04:35:05,919
But okay.

2959
04:35:05,919 --> 04:35:06,159
Cool.

2960
04:35:06,720 --> 04:35:07,200
Time to...

2961
04:35:07,200 --> 04:35:07,439
Wait.

2962
04:35:08,080 --> 04:35:18,619
They don't like fruits.

2963
04:35:19,340 --> 04:35:20,459
Don't give them fruits.

2964
04:35:28,759 --> 04:35:35,130
I'm gonna read chatter for your record.

2965
04:35:35,130 --> 04:35:35,610
I just did.

2966
04:35:35,610 --> 04:35:36,009
Thank you.

2967
04:35:36,889 --> 04:35:42,200
All right.

2968
04:35:42,200 --> 04:35:42,919
Go.

2969
04:35:42,919 --> 04:35:44,189
All right.

2970
04:35:44,189 --> 04:35:45,709
I need a briar hen.

2971
04:35:46,430 --> 04:35:47,709
What's my favorite fruit?

2972
04:35:47,709 --> 04:35:49,150
Banana or pineapple?

2973
04:35:49,150 --> 04:35:49,959
Pick one.

2974
04:35:49,959 --> 04:36:13,599
So, did I go...

2975
04:36:14,729 --> 04:36:15,290
Wait.

2976
04:36:15,290 --> 04:36:22,189
Excuse me.

2977
04:36:22,189 --> 04:36:23,069
Whoa.

2978
04:36:23,069 --> 04:36:23,950
Any briar hens?

2979
04:36:23,950 --> 04:36:24,430
No.

2980
04:36:24,430 --> 04:36:32,360
13 days straight.

2981
04:36:32,360 --> 04:36:35,930
Briar hens?

2982
04:36:35,930 --> 04:36:39,869
Probably in the other area.

2983
04:36:39,869 --> 04:36:43,450
A lot of shit over here.

2984
04:36:43,450 --> 04:36:49,790
Banana is a bewy.

2985
04:36:49,790 --> 04:36:51,200
Why did I say it like that?

2986
04:36:52,159 --> 04:36:52,639
Here.

2987
04:36:52,639 --> 04:36:53,200
Get out of here.

2988
04:36:54,509 --> 04:36:56,750
I said it like some half-assed dude.

2989
04:36:56,750 --> 04:36:57,869
Banana is a bewy.

2990
04:36:58,909 --> 04:37:00,090
Power core.

2991
04:37:00,090 --> 04:37:00,569
MK2.

2992
04:37:00,569 --> 04:37:00,810
Cool.

2993
04:37:01,369 --> 04:37:10,110
All right.

2994
04:37:10,110 --> 04:37:10,430
That's a...

2995
04:37:11,069 --> 04:37:12,509
It's decorating this entrance.

2996
04:37:14,080 --> 04:37:14,560
All right.

2997
04:37:15,360 --> 04:37:16,720
This is a big zone.

2998
04:37:16,720 --> 04:37:17,680
Let's just go across.

2999
04:37:18,400 --> 04:37:27,400
Okay.

3000
04:37:27,400 --> 04:37:28,520
Itchy eyes.

3001
04:37:28,520 --> 04:37:33,770
I'm looking for that ice cream cat again.

3002
04:37:34,799 --> 04:37:34,959
Ooh.

3003
04:37:34,959 --> 04:37:35,439
Here we go.

3004
04:37:35,439 --> 04:37:35,680
Yep.

3005
04:37:36,400 --> 04:37:37,119
Briar hens.

3006
04:37:37,119 --> 04:37:37,680
Cool.

3007
04:37:37,680 --> 04:37:38,000
Got it.

3008
04:37:38,560 --> 04:37:42,090
If I see an ice cream cat, scream.

3009
04:37:42,810 --> 04:37:48,650
I like the puddle slam.

3010
04:37:48,650 --> 04:37:49,209
I'm gonna take another one.

3011
04:37:49,209 --> 04:37:50,009
Is this briar?

3012
04:37:51,560 --> 04:37:51,959
Briar?

3013
04:37:53,529 --> 04:37:54,330
Briar hen?

3014
04:37:54,330 --> 04:37:54,569
No.

3015
04:37:55,130 --> 04:38:04,409
Okay.

3016
04:38:04,409 --> 04:38:05,529
Keep going.

3017
04:38:05,529 --> 04:38:11,049
What's over here?

3018
04:38:11,049 --> 04:38:15,369
Moss blanket may seem like an ancient jungle of sorts,

3019
04:38:15,369 --> 04:38:16,970
but the fact is that much of what you see here

3020
04:38:16,970 --> 04:38:19,610
wasn't even around when I first began exploring this land.

3021
04:38:19,610 --> 04:38:20,880
Whatever.

3022
04:38:27,950 --> 04:38:28,349
Cats.

3023
04:38:28,349 --> 04:38:29,069
Pink slimes.

3024
04:38:29,630 --> 04:38:33,310
I see that's a...

3025
04:38:33,310 --> 04:38:34,509
I see orange.

3026
04:38:34,509 --> 04:38:35,709
I see orange slimes.

3027
04:38:36,270 --> 04:38:37,580
What are you?

3028
04:38:37,580 --> 04:38:38,299
What are you?

3029
04:38:38,299 --> 04:38:38,939
I'll take it.

3030
04:38:39,659 --> 04:38:40,569
What are you?

3031
04:38:41,529 --> 04:38:42,729
Just a boom slime.

3032
04:38:43,369 --> 04:38:47,040
What are you?

3033
04:38:48,439 --> 04:38:49,799
You're a honey slime.

3034
04:38:49,799 --> 04:38:52,250
What the fuck?

3035
04:38:53,049 --> 04:38:54,139
Come here.

3036
04:38:54,779 --> 04:39:00,080
A honey slime.

3037
04:39:01,869 --> 04:39:03,200
Oh, give me these.

3038
04:39:04,240 --> 04:39:06,639
Is this a super honey slime?

3039
04:39:09,659 --> 04:39:14,009
Is this a honey...

3040
04:39:14,889 --> 04:39:16,330
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

3041
04:39:16,330 --> 04:39:17,209
Don't shoot them out.

3042
04:39:17,209 --> 04:39:18,009
I want those.

3043
04:39:18,009 --> 04:39:18,509
Why?

3044
04:39:19,610 --> 04:39:20,169
Fuck me.

3045
04:39:32,430 --> 04:39:33,549
Where are those honey slimes?

3046
04:39:34,270 --> 04:39:39,549
It's a big cat honey.

3047
04:39:41,159 --> 04:39:41,720
There you are.

3048
04:39:41,720 --> 04:39:42,200
All right.

3049
04:39:42,200 --> 04:39:43,080
I want these things.

3050
04:39:43,080 --> 04:39:43,479
And I also...

3051
04:39:43,479 --> 04:39:44,279
Give her the puddle slime.

3052
04:39:44,279 --> 04:39:45,000
I don't want to put...

3053
04:39:45,000 --> 04:39:46,439
Puddle slimes are cool, but I want the...

3054
04:39:49,150 --> 04:39:49,709
There's another...

3055
04:39:57,790 --> 04:39:58,509
Hi.

3056
04:39:58,509 --> 04:40:00,380
There's another...

3057
04:40:00,939 --> 04:40:03,159
I've got globules?

3058
04:40:04,479 --> 04:40:05,119
Globs?

3059
04:40:05,119 --> 04:40:05,759
What are they called?

3060
04:40:14,479 --> 04:40:15,759
Glob go gab galabs?

3061
04:40:17,360 --> 04:40:19,200
I'm the glob go gab galab.

3062
04:40:19,200 --> 04:40:22,700
I love butch.

3063
04:40:22,700 --> 04:40:24,779
This place is a treasure trove.

3064
04:40:35,159 --> 04:40:37,479
I am the glob go gab galab.

3065
04:40:37,479 --> 04:40:39,880
The shwabble dabble flabble fabble fabble flabble flab.

3066
04:40:39,880 --> 04:40:42,360
I am the yeast of thoughts and mind.

3067
04:40:42,360 --> 04:40:44,680
I am the yeast of thoughts and mind.

3068
04:40:45,400 --> 04:40:49,099
I had to go all out for that one.

3069
04:40:49,099 --> 04:41:01,119
I like the honey slimes.

3070
04:41:05,259 --> 04:41:05,979
You really didn't?

3071
04:41:05,979 --> 04:41:06,459
Yes, I did.

3072
04:41:07,099 --> 04:41:10,319
What do you mean?

3073
04:41:10,319 --> 04:41:11,520
No, I didn't have to go all out for that.

3074
04:41:11,520 --> 04:41:12,240
What are you talking about?

3075
04:41:12,799 --> 04:41:25,790
Give me that back.

3076
04:41:25,790 --> 04:41:27,180
That back.

3077
04:41:27,180 --> 04:41:27,819
Puddle.

3078
04:41:27,819 --> 04:41:29,900
You're a psycho ooey gooey one.

3079
04:41:32,669 --> 04:41:35,950
If the stream was not on right now, I would be...

3080
04:41:35,950 --> 04:41:36,270
Wait.

3081
04:41:36,270 --> 04:41:36,509
Okay.

3082
04:41:37,400 --> 04:41:40,520
I would be doing the thing that he does over and over again until...

3083
04:41:41,720 --> 04:41:43,080
Like my throat got tired.

3084
04:41:44,700 --> 04:41:45,740
Oh, what's that?

3085
04:41:45,740 --> 04:41:53,180
Hey.

3086
04:41:53,180 --> 04:41:55,240
Wait.

3087
04:41:55,240 --> 04:41:55,880
Oh, man.

3088
04:41:55,880 --> 04:41:56,840
There's one of these things.

3089
04:41:56,840 --> 04:41:57,000
I...

3090
04:41:58,360 --> 04:41:59,529
Sly cooper.

3091
04:42:00,490 --> 04:42:00,729
Shit.

3092
04:42:01,450 --> 04:42:03,000
Okay.

3093
04:42:03,000 --> 04:42:03,639
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

3094
04:42:03,639 --> 04:42:04,360
What are these fruits?

3095
04:42:04,360 --> 04:42:05,080
These are new fruits?

3096
04:42:08,060 --> 04:42:09,580
I have to go back.

3097
04:42:09,580 --> 04:42:10,459
I need to make a new...

3098
04:42:11,259 --> 04:42:11,979
I don't know.

3099
04:42:11,979 --> 04:42:12,619
I don't know what to do.

3100
04:42:14,599 --> 04:42:16,119
I'm overwhelmed.

3101
04:42:16,119 --> 04:42:17,000
I'm going to slow down.

3102
04:42:17,720 --> 04:42:20,110
I'm going to work on honey and boom.

3103
04:42:20,750 --> 04:42:26,299
I got the last 10 that I wanted.

3104
04:42:27,020 --> 04:42:27,900
Drop the plorts.

3105
04:42:27,900 --> 04:42:28,220
Why?

3106
04:42:28,860 --> 04:42:29,500
Finish the quest.

3107
04:42:29,500 --> 04:42:30,060
Yeah.

3108
04:42:30,060 --> 04:42:31,340
I want to bring the honey stuff back.

3109
04:42:31,979 --> 04:42:38,540
I need to feed these guys.

3110
04:42:39,099 --> 04:42:50,750
Get the sly cooper.

3111
04:42:51,310 --> 04:42:51,630
Hold on.

3112
04:42:52,990 --> 04:42:53,470
Jesus.

3113
04:42:54,590 --> 04:42:56,270
All right.

3114
04:42:56,270 --> 04:42:57,229
I'm going to take the sly cooper.

3115
04:42:57,790 --> 04:43:04,509
What just happened?

3116
04:43:04,509 --> 04:43:05,310
I'm going to get rid of the honey.

3117
04:43:05,869 --> 04:43:07,790
Come here.

3118
04:43:09,069 --> 04:43:09,869
Hunter slime.

3119
04:43:14,639 --> 04:43:15,439
Give me a few more of these.

3120
04:43:15,439 --> 04:43:16,720
I want to make a couple of new cages.

3121
04:43:20,569 --> 04:43:21,849
I want a few more honey slimes

3122
04:43:21,849 --> 04:43:22,810
and a few more hunter slimes.

3123
04:43:23,450 --> 04:43:29,240
Your pod is locked.

3124
04:43:29,240 --> 04:43:29,880
What?

3125
04:43:29,880 --> 04:43:30,200
Why?

3126
04:43:32,409 --> 04:43:33,369
Schwabble, dabble, dabble,

3127
04:43:33,369 --> 04:43:34,729
flabble, dabble, flub, flub.

3128
04:43:34,729 --> 04:43:35,610
Schwibble, schwabble, schwibble,

3129
04:43:35,610 --> 04:43:36,810
flabble, flabble, flub, flub.

3130
04:43:46,169 --> 04:43:47,130
Oh, come on.

3131
04:43:47,130 --> 04:43:49,560
It's an old ass meme.

3132
04:43:49,560 --> 04:43:53,369
It really is very old.

3133
04:43:53,369 --> 04:43:55,930
I mean, by the internet standards,

3134
04:43:55,930 --> 04:43:56,650
two or three years,

3135
04:43:56,650 --> 04:43:58,090
that might as well be 100.

3136
04:43:58,889 --> 04:44:02,250
Oh, good.

3137
04:44:02,250 --> 04:44:10,380
Here.

3138
04:44:10,380 --> 04:44:12,380
I want to get a good 10 to 20 of these.

3139
04:44:13,180 --> 04:44:15,130
New carrots.

3140
04:44:19,709 --> 04:44:20,669
Come here.

3141
04:44:20,669 --> 04:44:23,180
Honey slime.

3142
04:44:27,099 --> 04:44:28,139
I hear somebody freaking out.

3143
04:44:28,939 --> 04:44:29,419
Who turned?

3144
04:44:30,139 --> 04:44:36,439
Who turned?

3145
04:44:36,439 --> 04:44:47,040
Who turned?

3146
04:44:48,959 --> 04:44:49,200
Me.

3147
04:44:55,819 --> 04:44:56,380
I am.

3148
04:44:57,180 --> 04:44:58,779
I am.

3149
04:44:58,779 --> 04:45:00,380
Very, very tricky to do the first part of that.

3150
04:45:01,180 --> 04:45:01,979
I am the...

3151
04:45:02,619 --> 04:45:03,520
Got to get it right.

3152
04:45:04,240 --> 04:45:05,529
Oh, look, a decoration.

3153
04:45:05,529 --> 04:45:05,770
Cool.

3154
04:45:06,409 --> 04:45:18,119
Something's glowing over here.

3155
04:45:18,119 --> 04:45:18,360
What?

3156
04:45:19,319 --> 04:45:20,380
Shit.

3157
04:45:20,380 --> 04:45:21,689
I don't even know what I did,

3158
04:45:21,689 --> 04:45:22,169
but I wanted to...

3159
04:45:22,810 --> 04:45:25,310
Whatever.

3160
04:45:26,189 --> 04:45:29,290
Give me these.

3161
04:45:30,240 --> 04:45:31,759
Two more briar hens.

3162
04:45:31,759 --> 04:45:40,959
Oh, hunter slime.

3163
04:45:40,959 --> 04:45:42,720
Got it.

3164
04:45:42,720 --> 04:45:43,220
Cool.

3165
04:45:44,720 --> 04:45:45,360
Boom blocks.

3166
04:45:45,919 --> 04:45:52,459
Go home, poo poo brain streamer.

3167
04:45:52,459 --> 04:45:53,099
Come back and get the stuff.

3168
04:45:53,099 --> 04:45:53,740
Remember to sleep.

3169
04:45:53,740 --> 04:45:53,979
Okay.

3170
04:45:54,540 --> 04:45:58,400
Where does this take me?

3171
04:45:59,040 --> 04:46:05,529
Royal jelly.

3172
04:46:06,169 --> 04:46:12,860
I use that to go back?

3173
04:46:17,439 --> 04:46:19,040
Wait, it's not a return portal?

3174
04:46:19,040 --> 04:46:19,680
Are you kidding me?

3175
04:46:23,680 --> 04:46:24,080
Oh, well.

3176
04:46:24,080 --> 04:46:24,319
All right.

3177
04:46:24,319 --> 04:46:25,439
So what do I get for this?

3178
04:46:25,439 --> 04:46:26,479
Money and...

3179
04:46:26,479 --> 04:46:26,880
Yeah, fine.

3180
04:46:26,880 --> 04:46:27,279
Here you go.

3181
04:46:29,689 --> 04:46:32,569
Fill up this hen house.

3182
04:46:33,290 --> 04:46:35,520
Briar hens.

3183
04:46:35,520 --> 04:46:36,720
I probably should make another pen,

3184
04:46:36,720 --> 04:46:37,119
shouldn't I?

3185
04:46:37,919 --> 04:46:40,590
Why are these honey slimes purple?

3186
04:46:40,590 --> 04:46:58,459
Get the elder chicken out.

3187
04:47:01,360 --> 04:47:01,759
Hold on.

3188
04:47:02,400 --> 04:47:05,770
Play boom blocks or the debt will increase

3189
04:47:05,770 --> 04:47:06,729
with interest, whatever.

3190
04:47:07,689 --> 04:47:08,189
Okay.

3191
04:47:09,069 --> 04:47:11,310
Um, I want to...

3192
04:47:12,430 --> 04:47:14,779
Still loading up this one.

3193
04:47:14,779 --> 04:47:16,060
I'm gonna just wait until this is at like 100.

3194
04:47:16,779 --> 04:47:19,610
Let's keep the fruit in here.

3195
04:47:20,169 --> 04:47:21,709
This is a fruit.

3196
04:47:21,709 --> 04:47:23,229
So who likes fruits?

3197
04:47:23,229 --> 04:47:24,509
Who likes fruits?

3198
04:47:24,509 --> 04:47:24,909
We do.

3199
04:47:25,790 --> 04:47:34,650
A lot of debt.

3200
04:47:35,209 --> 04:47:40,619
There's your debt counter.

3201
04:47:51,159 --> 04:47:51,479
Okay.

3202
04:47:51,479 --> 04:47:52,119
Pog fruit.

3203
04:47:52,759 --> 04:47:54,349
Not bad.

3204
04:47:54,990 --> 04:47:55,709
Let's get rid of them.

3205
04:47:55,709 --> 04:47:56,750
I don't want to use them anymore.

3206
04:47:56,750 --> 04:47:58,349
We'll suck up all these radishes.

3207
04:48:03,099 --> 04:48:03,599
Oops.

3208
04:48:07,130 --> 04:48:08,650
We need a new place for honey slimes.

3209
04:48:10,009 --> 04:48:10,970
And for hunter slimes.

3210
04:48:10,970 --> 04:48:12,490
I need two more dens.

3211
04:48:13,209 --> 04:48:16,029
Come back and take care of this.

3212
04:48:16,029 --> 04:48:16,750
How are you guys doing?

3213
04:48:17,979 --> 04:48:18,700
We're hungry.

3214
04:48:19,580 --> 04:48:29,259
Get that in.

3215
04:48:29,900 --> 04:48:31,659
I'm gonna have a big payday here in a second.

3216
04:48:39,930 --> 04:48:40,409
All right.

3217
04:48:40,409 --> 04:48:42,889
You guys want something.

3218
04:48:43,689 --> 04:48:47,740
Hello.

3219
04:48:49,439 --> 04:48:49,759
Okay.

3220
04:48:50,479 --> 04:48:53,180
I'll take the boom boards.

3221
04:48:56,139 --> 04:48:56,619
All right.

3222
04:48:56,619 --> 04:48:57,580
New den.

3223
04:48:58,299 --> 04:49:01,040
Burgess.

3224
04:49:01,040 --> 04:49:01,520
Another one.

3225
04:49:02,159 --> 04:49:04,970
All right.

3226
04:49:04,970 --> 04:49:06,090
Hunters are going in here.

3227
04:49:06,729 --> 04:49:09,240
Honey's are going in here.

3228
04:49:14,509 --> 04:49:16,319
Cool.

3229
04:49:16,319 --> 04:49:17,680
Increase that wall, please.

3230
04:49:20,299 --> 04:49:21,099
Where are they?

3231
04:49:21,099 --> 04:49:21,340
Oh.

3232
04:49:21,900 --> 04:49:24,959
All right.

3233
04:49:24,959 --> 04:49:26,479
Just don't jump out.

3234
04:49:26,479 --> 04:49:29,259
All right.

3235
04:49:29,259 --> 04:49:29,979
The honey's purple.

3236
04:49:29,979 --> 04:49:31,500
I have like the DLC.

3237
04:49:31,500 --> 04:49:32,459
Purchase skin thing.

3238
04:49:32,459 --> 04:49:33,340
I don't know.

3239
04:49:33,340 --> 04:49:36,840
I'm gonna come back in here with some fruits.

3240
04:49:37,560 --> 04:49:41,259
I'll take this bounty from the puddles.

3241
04:49:42,139 --> 04:49:43,340
Thank you.

3242
04:49:43,340 --> 04:49:43,740
You too.

3243
04:49:44,619 --> 04:49:45,419
You've done a great job.

3244
04:49:47,740 --> 04:49:47,979
Look.

3245
04:49:47,979 --> 04:49:48,700
I will.

3246
04:49:48,700 --> 04:49:49,950
What happened to him?

3247
04:49:53,959 --> 04:49:59,310
Stay in here.

3248
04:50:00,029 --> 04:50:03,419
Okay.

3249
04:50:03,419 --> 04:50:07,000
Everyone hang out in here for a few minutes.

3250
04:50:07,000 --> 04:50:07,799
I'll be right back.

3251
04:50:08,520 --> 04:50:18,040
We need vegetables to go up there.

3252
04:50:19,319 --> 04:50:19,959
Tuck these up.

3253
04:50:22,360 --> 04:50:22,840
Veggies.

3254
04:50:25,959 --> 04:50:28,360
I just love a big, a nice crunchy radish.

3255
04:50:28,360 --> 04:50:29,400
I have radishes too.

3256
04:50:29,400 --> 04:50:30,119
I can't wait to eat them.

3257
04:50:30,919 --> 04:50:33,200
I'm gonna have pizza and radishes tonight.

3258
04:50:33,200 --> 04:50:34,240
That sounds awesome to me.

3259
04:50:34,880 --> 04:50:35,919
Separately, by the way.

3260
04:50:35,919 --> 04:50:36,880
Separately.

3261
04:50:36,880 --> 04:50:38,319
Not together on the same thing.

3262
04:50:38,319 --> 04:50:38,880
Separately.

3263
04:50:39,599 --> 04:50:40,319
An hour apart.

3264
04:50:41,040 --> 04:50:42,560
Pizza for dinner.

3265
04:50:42,560 --> 04:50:44,400
And then have radishes later.

3266
04:50:44,400 --> 04:50:44,880
Separately.

3267
04:50:44,880 --> 04:50:45,759
I didn't say at the same time.

3268
04:50:46,400 --> 04:50:54,680
I mean these are almost ready.

3269
04:50:54,680 --> 04:50:55,400
Might as well.

3270
04:50:55,400 --> 04:50:56,119
Wait.

3271
04:50:56,119 --> 04:51:00,650
All right.

3272
04:51:00,650 --> 04:51:02,330
You guys like veggies.

3273
04:51:02,330 --> 04:51:02,810
There you go.

3274
04:51:09,799 --> 04:51:12,520
Now it's time to do a massive collection.

3275
04:51:14,060 --> 04:51:14,540
You'll see.

3276
04:51:16,700 --> 04:51:17,419

3277
04:51:17,419 --> 04:51:17,740

Prediction.

3279
04:51:18,779 --> 04:51:21,180
I will have two to three thousand dollars in my bank account.

3280
04:51:21,900 --> 04:51:22,540

3281
04:51:23,900 --> 04:51:24,299

3282
04:51:34,380 --> 04:51:34,779

3284
04:51:40,860 --> 04:51:42,169
What's he got?

3285
04:51:42,889 --> 04:51:44,009
Nothing, nothing, nothing.

3286
04:51:44,729 --> 04:51:46,750
How's the auto feeder?

3287
04:51:47,229 --> 04:51:54,439
Fill it back up.

3288
04:51:56,200 --> 04:51:57,560
Good.

3289
04:51:57,560 --> 04:51:58,680
I knew it was all gonna fall.

3290
04:51:58,680 --> 04:51:59,159
I told you.

3291
04:51:59,799 --> 04:52:03,319
Good to go.

3292
04:52:03,319 --> 04:52:04,279
Good to go.

3293
04:52:04,279 --> 04:52:05,000
Suck everything up.

3294
04:52:05,000 --> 04:52:05,799
Suck everything up.

3295
04:52:05,799 --> 04:52:06,200
Suck it.

3296
04:52:07,400 --> 04:52:07,639
Up.

3297
04:52:08,959 --> 04:52:09,439
Suck it up.

3298
04:52:12,189 --> 04:52:12,590
I mean.

3299
04:52:13,979 --> 04:52:14,619
Go for it.

3300
04:52:16,090 --> 04:52:16,729
Very cool.

3301
04:52:17,290 --> 04:52:17,610

3302
04:52:18,330 --> 04:52:19,049
And then here.

3303
04:52:19,610 --> 04:52:19,930
We.

3304
04:52:22,810 --> 04:52:23,959
I didn't finish it.

3305
04:52:23,959 --> 04:52:24,919
My new people are gonna be mad.

3306
04:52:28,919 --> 04:52:38,200
Have these.

3307
04:52:38,200 --> 04:52:40,360
Oh, these have increased in value.

3308
04:52:45,880 --> 04:52:49,639
How about a phosphorus hunter.

3309
04:52:50,279 --> 04:52:51,119
Honey.

3310
04:52:52,000 --> 04:52:52,400
Boom.

3311
04:52:53,200 --> 04:52:53,680
Spider.

3312
04:53:07,290 --> 04:53:07,930
Put those back.

3313
04:53:09,849 --> 04:53:10,490
Oh, here we go.

3314
04:53:10,490 --> 04:53:10,970
Watch this.

3315
04:53:14,110 --> 04:53:15,229
The punch through the monitor.

3316
04:53:15,229 --> 04:53:18,189
And the only reason you're reading this is because you're so long.

3317
04:53:18,189 --> 04:53:20,189
As I don't move my arm, the computer stays alive.

3318
04:53:22,880 --> 04:53:26,439
But you punched into the monitor like your hand went into the monitor.

3319
04:53:32,700 --> 04:53:34,700
What are you doing that for?

3320
04:53:35,580 --> 04:53:38,799
You gotta relax, dude.

3321
04:53:47,659 --> 04:53:48,619
Gamer rage.

3322
04:53:49,340 --> 04:53:56,029
Look at this selling.

3323
04:53:56,430 --> 04:54:04,029
Oh, fun sorting algorithm.

3324
04:54:04,029 --> 04:54:06,430
All right, I'm gonna hold on to the booms for now.

3325
04:54:07,150 --> 04:54:13,229
I think I'm gonna sell the puddles because do I really?

3326
04:54:19,020 --> 04:54:19,659
Lots of chickens.

3327
04:54:19,659 --> 04:54:20,380
All right, we gotta feed.

3328
04:54:21,099 --> 04:54:22,279
What happened to the rooster?

3329
04:54:25,919 --> 04:54:27,680
Oh, they think they ate the rooster.

3330
04:54:27,680 --> 04:54:28,639
Is it dead?

3331
04:54:29,520 --> 04:54:40,459
The rooster's dead.

3332
04:54:40,459 --> 04:54:41,340
All right, the rooster died.

3333
04:54:41,340 --> 04:54:42,139
I need a new rooster.

3334
04:54:52,430 --> 04:54:52,909
Hi, guys.

3335
04:55:01,759 --> 04:55:03,439

Okay, so should I do royal jelly boom?

Okay, so here we go.

Somebody, I need to feed one of these guys.

You need to be careful.

3399
04:57:41,639 --> 04:57:42,279

04:57:57,119 --> 04:57:58,319
You need to be careful.

3409
04:57:59,680 --> 04:58:01,040
I was bad at that game.

3410
04:58:06,220 --> 04:58:06,700
Focus.

3411
04:58:06,700 --> 04:58:07,259
Right, right, right.

Yeah, okay.

3413
04:58:07,659 --> 04:58:08,139
What am I doing?

3414
04:58:08,779 --> 04:58:11,950
All right, we're giving a hunter to the honey.

3415
04:58:18,299 --> 04:58:19,020
Sheva.

3416
04:58:19,020 --> 04:58:21,819
Sheva like spray painting me with the spray heel

3417
04:58:21,819 --> 04:58:24,060
while the chainsaw guy was right behind her.

3418
04:58:24,060 --> 04:58:24,540
And then just...

3419
04:58:25,900 --> 04:58:29,819
Here we go.

3420
04:58:29,819 --> 04:58:30,459

Whoa.

3424
04:58:34,349 --> 04:58:38,040

Hey, why is he angry?

3426
04:58:41,849 --> 04:58:43,919
What's he angry for?

3427
04:58:43,919 --> 04:58:44,880
Stop being so angry.

3428
04:58:46,240 --> 04:58:47,439
Don't be so fucking angry.

3429
04:58:49,689 --> 04:58:50,490
Everybody eat up.

3430
04:58:58,590 --> 04:58:59,790
We need you to turn into hunters.

3431
04:59:00,349 --> 04:59:01,869
They're so fucking mad right now.

3432
04:59:01,869 --> 04:59:02,110
Why?

3433
04:59:02,830 --> 04:59:10,159
I need a music box.

3434
04:59:14,939 --> 04:59:15,740

to do i know what to do jigsaw you're fucked i'm coming out i'm getting out of this alive

3493
05:09:24,750 --> 05:09:31,310
i know i know what to do you have to get a solid white on each row don't try to get it all in one

3497
05:10:30,409 --> 05:10:36,299
an idiot he didn't take my phone away when i got into the front door this video is removed from

3498
05:10:36,299 --> 05:10:42,639
youtube why so if you've never solved the cube before it may seem impossibly hard but today i'll

3499
05:10:42,639 --> 05:10:46,880
be teaching you a method that i used to teach many people did not believe they could ever be

3500
05:10:46,880 --> 05:10:54,159
able to solve the cube anything along the way becomes unfamiliar and you need more examples

3501
05:10:54,159 --> 05:11:00,250
thank you that being said it's time for you to solve your first cube yep so the first thing you

3502
05:11:00,250 --> 05:11:05,290
do is find the white center piece and then hold that on top what you do is solve the white cross

3503
05:11:05,290 --> 05:11:13,770
what what like a white piece on the bottom layer um what's bottom there's no bottom there is no

3504
05:11:13,770 --> 05:11:21,389
top there is no left and right always because he has a different cube

3505
05:11:23,630 --> 05:11:28,959
he has a different cube he has one that has like an actual centerpiece oh this person's so

3506
05:11:28,959 --> 05:11:37,360
intelligent they're way too intelligent for me but that's the person's way too smart for me all right

3507
05:11:37,360 --> 05:12:02,220
hold on i'm gonna do it my way remove the stickers just remove just pull the stickers off

3508
05:12:03,180 --> 05:12:20,040
remove the stickers i have to just if you get one side no these are not even possible is it weird

3509
05:12:20,040 --> 05:12:24,759
that i feel like if you can do a rubik's cube and like just by looking at it that you are on like

3510
05:12:24,759 --> 05:12:28,599
another plane of intelligence or existence or something like you can just look at it and do it

3511
05:12:29,400 --> 05:12:41,290
like guys i have trouble with you know when you have looking at a telephone and it has the number

3512
05:12:41,290 --> 05:12:46,009
the letters and the numbers corresponding to each one i still i have trouble like spelling a word

3513
05:12:46,090 --> 05:12:52,200
still i'm not gonna do a rubik's cube some people can just like

3514
05:12:56,040 --> 05:13:02,279
it's like you're you're an alien you're an alien person you are an alien and you have like a hyper

3515
05:13:02,279 --> 05:13:08,110
alien intelligence not me i can't even figure out a fucking telephone you can do it i can't do it

3516
05:13:20,349 --> 05:13:33,680
fuck i can't do it it's too hard i don't i don't understand it it's too many it's too much you can't

3517
05:13:33,680 --> 05:13:59,319
give up i i'm gonna give up i'm gonna give up in about five seconds wait hold on and then and then

where's the centerpiece what the fuck are you talking about this i'm reading the guide

3578
05:23:54,000 --> 05:24:05,020
you're a fucking idiot what so this this okay look at the up face look at the top layer to

3579
05:24:05,020 --> 05:24:12,509
locate the edge pieces that have a white tile leave them where they are what the thing in the

3580
05:24:12,509 --> 05:24:24,119
center the yellow piece in the middle this one but i've moved it around center of the nine by nine

3581
05:24:24,119 --> 05:24:29,549
yes yeah i but look at the top layer to locate the edge pieces that have a white

3582
05:24:29,549 --> 05:24:39,419
tile leave them where they are what doesn't matter it's the example to the right notice

3583
05:24:39,419 --> 05:24:46,439
that this stage is okay that if it's okay if the white tile is not touching the yellow centerpiece

3584
05:24:47,159 --> 05:24:55,229
we have no white touching the centerpiece okay we're good look at the middle layer move edge

3585
05:24:55,229 --> 05:24:59,869
pieces that have a white tile from the middle layer onto the top layer i'm just killing saw

3586
05:24:59,869 --> 05:25:04,349
just throw the grenade just throw a grenade in the room and then just donate all this money like

3587
05:25:04,349 --> 05:25:07,950
just throw the throw roll the grenade in the room and just donate them just donate the money

3588
05:25:07,950 --> 05:25:19,900
i don't want it boom i don't care look at the middle and have moved edge pieces that have a

3589
05:25:19,900 --> 05:25:32,250
white tile from the middle layer under the top layer like this i don't know be careful not to

3590
05:25:32,250 --> 05:25:37,209
bump out the white edges already in the daisy rotate the up face to move a white edge out of

3591
05:25:37,209 --> 05:25:48,509
the way before moving into the white edge into the daisy throw the grenade words

3592
05:25:49,150 --> 05:26:00,169
haha word salad i'm trying to have the fucking end of the movie in my head

3593
05:26:00,889 --> 05:26:06,889
rotate the up face to move a white edge out of the way before moving another white edge into the daisy

3594
05:26:08,169 --> 05:26:18,759
put the yellow on top wait you look at the bottom layer move edge pieces that have a

3595
05:26:18,759 --> 05:26:23,880
white tile from the bottom layer onto the top layer and flip it or sometimes when you place

3596
05:26:23,880 --> 05:26:27,720
the edge in the top layer the white tile is not on the up face and it needs to be flipped

3597
05:26:29,049 --> 05:26:33,209
to flip the edge so the white tile is on the up face hold your rubik's cubes the edge

3598
05:26:33,209 --> 05:26:37,689
that needs to be flipped is on the right our face follow the algorithm what algorithm

3599
05:26:37,689 --> 05:26:50,759
it's not a math problem what do we follow the algorithm there is no algorithm follow the

3600
05:26:50,759 --> 05:27:03,500
algorithm he's the adh just saw saw hello saw yes where is it uh i've been here for a very long
