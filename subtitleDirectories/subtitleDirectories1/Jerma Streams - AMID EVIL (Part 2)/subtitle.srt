1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:04,730
Listen, that's not a defeat for me. Listen, I will be fucking doing cartwheels

2
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:09,929
In my fucking apartment knowing that you're not as smart as me when I do the fucking bomb game with you

3
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:13,609
Listen, you all right. When do you want to do it? When do you want to do it? When do you want to do it?

4
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:19,420
Whenever you're ready. Well, not today. That is but you know next week

5
00:00:20,579 --> 00:00:25,539
Yeah, i'm down with the clown at some point next week. You want to keep talking nobody explodes not halo

6
00:00:26,179 --> 00:00:28,179
Not not halo

7
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:33,100
I think i'm never gonna fucking ever play halo because of you

8
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:37,579
I didn't do anything

9
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,840
Because of you

10
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,840
Oh my god

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,079
Did I ruin halo for you? I wasn't the one calling me at like 2 a.m. Saying

12
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:53,350
Hey gamer, listen, i've been thinking a lot

13
00:00:54,229 --> 00:00:58,060
And you know, it'll be pretty fucking pretty fucking hello gamer

14
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:04,140
Halo legendary and I I told them guys this is this is true fact. This is not me making the whole bullshit up

15
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:06,379
I told germa

16
00:01:06,379 --> 00:01:08,519
first of all

17
00:01:08,519 --> 00:01:13,640
I don't I don't really play that much halo and you kept lying to me for weeks upon end saying

18
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:18,359
You know back in the day halo was my jam. This is verbatim, by the way

19
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,140
germa germa

20
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:22,840
threateningly

21
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,840
uh recommended

22
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,480
Halo to me

23
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,519
and

24
00:01:28,519 --> 00:01:33,319
I said maybe maybe and then we get around to doing it and you've been doing nothing but insulting me

25
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:40,519
And saying mean things to me my favorite part of the sir my favorite part about this whole two-hour broadcast so far

26
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:45,959
Absolutely. Is this is may is it gonna make me laugh for the next probably three straight days. Is that

27
00:01:47,239 --> 00:01:50,920
That you didn't want to even do like a halo at all

28
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:57,719
And we're like, let's do halo halo legendary and you're just right that you're just sitting there going. I fucking don't want to be here

29
00:02:00,379 --> 00:02:02,219
That's so fucking funny

30
00:02:02,299 --> 00:02:05,500
Okay, well i'll tell you what i'll tell you the analogy here, right

31
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:09,180
This is a little story. I'm gonna i'm gonna open up a medieval while we talk

32
00:02:10,219 --> 00:02:12,219
Okay, imagine

33
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:15,419
Paling around with friends you really like these friends, right?

34
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:19,500
Mm-hmm, and you think they're funny. They're great

35
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:23,020
And then you follow them underneath the bridge

36
00:02:24,139 --> 00:02:26,139
And they all pull out syringes

37
00:02:29,659 --> 00:02:31,819
They stab themselves in the genitals with syringes

38
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:33,740
and

39
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:35,419
You like these friends

40
00:02:35,419 --> 00:02:36,939
But you don't like what they're doing

41
00:02:36,939 --> 00:02:42,219
But you you keep going on with it and then you stab yourself with the syringe and you smile through your teeth and say

42
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:44,460
Oh my god. Yeah, I like this

43
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:50,219
And you you and you don't know if they're enjoying it. So you're just kind of going along with it now

44
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:54,300
At this point i'm bleeding out of my cock. So what what what?

45
00:02:55,819 --> 00:02:57,819
When what when did I

46
00:02:58,219 --> 00:03:04,310
So i'm saying no more halo not tonight maybe at some point next time we're doing this

47
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:09,110
We're not fucking playing a game. We're unfamiliar with and we're not putting it on the hardest difficulty

48
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:17,050
All right, how about how about keep talking and nobody explodes

49
00:03:17,849 --> 00:03:18,810
uh

50
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:20,330
next week

51
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:22,409
Yes, I think that sounds like a great idea

52
00:03:23,509 --> 00:03:27,750
I i'm quickly learning something. All right, let's see. We don't interact too much on stream

53
00:03:28,389 --> 00:03:30,389
We wrestle sometime

54
00:03:30,389 --> 00:03:32,229
You know, but

55
00:03:32,229 --> 00:03:37,189
I don't think fps games and us. It's like orange juice and toothpaste. We need

56
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,400
logical games

57
00:03:41,979 --> 00:03:46,620
We need big brain games we need games for big boys. All right

58
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,639
Where's my save?

59
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:51,639
We need games like portal

60
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:53,990
math games

61
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:55,669
I'll take a math game

62
00:03:55,669 --> 00:03:58,310
You good at math?

63
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:00,680
Uh, not at all

64
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,680
Like as as zero as you could be at math

65
00:04:04,789 --> 00:04:07,430
What about the pogo game? Oh, yeah, that's right. We never did the pogo game

66
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:13,270
Have you played a video you played dusk?

67
00:04:15,979 --> 00:04:19,819
They're very good

68
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:28,009
Uh, i'll say it one more time. It's been my favorite. What was my favorite? What?

69
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:32,089

Play co-op halo and then both just go to different games and play different things and do different streams in the same call

86
00:05:38,389 --> 00:05:40,389
That's fucking hilarious

87
00:05:43,129 --> 00:05:49,750
Oh, that's awesome. Oh, that's that's what being a gamer is all about you improvise

88
00:05:50,709 --> 00:05:52,790
And you learn that you hate fucking video games

89
00:05:56,899 --> 00:06:00,180
Well, I I like video games if they're uh brain related

90
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:06,060

None of my viewers appreciate your hostility. All right

173
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:15,110
I don't know where the fuck this this anger and resentment from you is coming from but are you watching the stream right now?

So you're saying that the boston accent is from a movie as well

234
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:04,009
I mean

235
00:17:04,009 --> 00:17:05,940

When we do keep talking and nobody explodes

243
00:17:34,279 --> 00:17:37,720
To kick your ass. I'll tell you what though. This this might have been like

244
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:42,039
The absolute shittiest slash best stream ever done

245
00:17:42,839 --> 00:17:46,759
It's like I I don't know what quality is anymore because I don't have any like quality control

246
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:50,230
but i'll tell you what like

247
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:54,099
I I think this is cock and ball torture

248
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:56,660
You know, you know what cock and ball torture is

249
00:18:00,059 --> 00:18:02,380
Yes

250
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:05,579
You know, there's there's an element of like well, yeah, i'm not saying i'm into that stuff

251
00:18:05,579 --> 00:18:07,900
but i'm saying I relate more to that stuff, you know, because

252
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,700
Then to halo

253
00:18:11,619 --> 00:18:15,619
Hold on you relate more to than to halo reach

254
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:21,400
I'm just saying that listen the deal is or well, whatever it is

255
00:18:22,809 --> 00:18:24,900
I hate pain

256
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:28,019
But I feel compelled to come back. So who knows?

257
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:32,059
Who knows?

258
00:18:32,059 --> 00:18:35,180
Uh, anyway, I loved it. It was fun

259
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:41,980
This this okay in all seriousness not like all shit aside. This was a lot of fun. I think a lot of the uh,

260
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:47,259
The fun inadvertently was derived from the fact that

261
00:18:48,539 --> 00:18:50,220
It was a shit show

262
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:54,059
Uh, we came in so underprepared and well

263
00:18:55,819 --> 00:18:58,140
But how do you come and prepare to like just pull

264
00:18:59,019 --> 00:19:00,619
halo

265
00:19:00,619 --> 00:19:03,180
We don't have to like read a bunch of books to play halo

266
00:19:04,279 --> 00:19:09,960
Well, it took us like three fucking hours to get into the menu and then after we're actually starting streaming then you know, hey, so

267
00:19:10,039 --> 00:19:11,539
So

268
00:19:11,539 --> 00:19:13,559
No, it was a pleasure

269
00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:15,559
We'll see we'll see you next time

270
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:18,920
No, no. Yeah for real though, like let's next time

271
00:19:19,799 --> 00:19:22,039
We'll actually set something up that we both enjoy

272
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:25,240
And it's not fucking 4 a.m in the morning

278
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,640

294
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,980

295
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:45,259

296
00:20:45,259 --> 00:20:49,500
Not that bad. I've heard this analogy before and it hits me going telling stories filling

297
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:53,740
You got you got filling. You know, I think it's you know, I think it's actually worse than chewing on

00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:56,859
I don't know if you're gonna relate to this or whatever it is

299
00:20:57,579 --> 00:20:59,579

00:25:50,299 --> 00:25:52,299
scarring the stream with uh

370
00:25:53,099 --> 00:25:56,059
New low in stream quality, but there was

371
00:25:56,700 --> 00:26:01,660
Some pooh-pooh talk and stuff that I wasn't a fan of either. I'll just i'll address that with you off stream

372
00:26:03,099 --> 00:26:10,059
Everything I see

373
00:26:10,059 --> 00:26:11,099

385
00:26:45,339 --> 00:26:49,660
I am I am too, but let's not do it at fucking 4 am because it's it's going to give me

386
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:52,140
Fucking nightmares on week 7

387
00:26:52,619 --> 00:26:53,420

388
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:55,180
I hope you get a good sleep

And have a wonderful rest of your night and everyone that was uh

391
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:07,160
Uh on joel's stream

392
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:11,559
Have a great night, too

393
00:27:11,559 --> 00:27:16,329
All of you

394
00:27:16,329 --> 00:27:19,059
Well, this is my cue to leave

395
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:21,220
Uh, yeah, it is actually

396
00:27:26,619 --> 00:27:28,619
You want to pull the plug on ending the call

397
00:27:29,259 --> 00:27:32,380
Uh, I i'm currently, uh fighting monsters

398
00:27:33,099 --> 00:27:35,099
Well, if you're a gamer you would have been able to do it

399
00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:38,970
You've seen a game like this before it takes a lot of focus

400
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:43,980
You're playing with four hands

401
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:47,059
That would be actually kind of cool

402
00:27:47,059 --> 00:27:51,619
Does you really make a game like that where you hold down right mouse and it's move fast and then left is

403
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:54,740
That's kind of cool. That's not a bad idea

404
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:57,220
Jerma, how about this? Tell me a story

405
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:01,660
I thought wait, are you still here?

406
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:05,019
Jerma you just tell me any story you want and um

407
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:08,230
Okay

408
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:10,230
Once there was a once there was a boy

409
00:28:11,109 --> 00:28:12,069
named

410
00:28:12,069 --> 00:28:14,069
Let's just say his name was dave

411
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:18,730
dave

412
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:23,140
God, I can't do this while playing this game. It's not gonna happen

413
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:27,079
This is two of my hemispheres are fighting each other

414
00:28:30,519 --> 00:28:33,019
How about this for a story?

415
00:28:33,019 --> 00:28:34,920
Oh, he's gone. He left

416
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:37,720
That's what though. That was what it was. He wanted me to tell a long story

417
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:39,799
I'm glad I couldn't come up with anything because he left

418
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,160
Yeah

419
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:48,039
I I know your little game. That's why the story sucked. It wasn't even worth listening to because I didn't even tell anything

420
00:28:51,829 --> 00:28:55,670
All right. See you later. Joel

421
00:28:55,670 --> 00:28:57,670
All right. Okay

422
00:28:58,779 --> 00:29:02,619
Cool. All right. So that was hey, let me change the game name from halo reach

423
00:29:06,759 --> 00:29:12,089
dude

424
00:29:12,089 --> 00:29:14,089
The best part about this whole stream

425
00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:17,849
Is how he was just humoring me playing halo

426
00:29:17,849 --> 00:29:21,690
He just didn't want to play it and took him two hours to be like I fucking can't do it

427
00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:23,690
And I don't I don't want to play anymore

428
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:33,380
That's the best part, but I ain't going anywhere. I ain't going anywhere. I'm gonna stick around

429
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:46,940
We will play something again

430
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:49,509
That was a good introduction

431
00:29:49,509 --> 00:29:51,740
Right. I would say so

432
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:55,099
Let me leave the let me leave the squad so we're not squad streaming anymore

433
00:29:57,210 --> 00:30:01,049
All right, let me I gotta change the people think i'm playing halo reach and they're like, what the fuck are you doing?

434
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:06,869
I almost just clicked raid channel and raided shul

435
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:08,950
Imagine if I did that

436
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:11,529
All right. Let me change uh

437
00:30:11,529 --> 00:30:14,150
Let me get this on envied evil

438
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:22,599
It always ends in viscera cleanup detail, doesn't it?

439
00:30:23,559 --> 00:30:25,240
I told you hey

440
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,559
But hold on a second here. This is actually really really interesting

441
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Didn't I say yesterday?

442
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:36,200
Or the day the yeah yesterday. I said a medieval. He's a fucking what the hell is going on

443
00:30:36,839 --> 00:30:40,920
Jerma's foolish. Holy that scared the fuck out of me. I thought I was not even in a call

444
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:49,430
Holy shit, that was terrible. That actually scared me. I thought somebody was like coming to kill me or something

445
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:51,430
I thought someone was going to kill me

446
00:30:57,660 --> 00:30:59,099
Oh my god

447
00:30:59,099 --> 00:31:04,089
all right, you know when something like that happens and

448
00:31:05,019 --> 00:31:10,059
That you know that nothing can hurt you but like you're the room you're in just became like

449
00:31:10,839 --> 00:31:12,220
dangerous

450
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:18,200
That's what happened. My room was just dangerous for like a half a second. I was like hands are about to go around my neck

451
00:31:18,759 --> 00:31:21,829
uh, but I uh, I did say

452
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:23,509
that

453
00:31:23,509 --> 00:31:26,390
Nothing can hurt you. Yeah. I did say that I was never gonna play this again

454
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:29,109
I was like, yeah, i'm just gonna say i'm gonna play it i'm never gonna play it and here we are

455
00:31:32,309 --> 00:31:34,309
Uh, you know, i'm into it for a little bit. I'm into it

456
00:31:40,839 --> 00:31:51,750
Dragon quest builders that I just hear are very quiet and nothing's going to hurt. No. No, I I made sure I left that call

457
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:54,710
Am I gonna do halo again?

458
00:31:56,490 --> 00:31:58,490
Yeah, you know what? I might just

459
00:31:59,049 --> 00:32:01,049
I kind of want to play halo

460
00:32:02,619 --> 00:32:06,299
Like I want to I kind of want to play halo. I might just play it

461
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:09,420
And put it on like a like a heart

462
00:32:14,329 --> 00:32:22,759
What if I went back to halo right now? I feel like that's I feel like I can't do that today

463
00:32:23,079 --> 00:32:25,079
I feel like I can't do that today

464
00:32:25,670 --> 00:32:27,670
That's uh, that's like tomorrow

465
00:32:32,339 --> 00:32:36,309
Do it with somebody else

466
00:32:36,390 --> 00:32:38,390
Okay. Now that's fucking funny

467
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:42,789
Just do it do it just don't tell them don't tell them. Okay

468
00:32:43,829 --> 00:32:46,789
Whoever is whoever does the halo campaign tomorrow

469
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:51,509
Do not tell them that like I got abandoned because they'd uh, no

470
00:32:52,950 --> 00:33:01,339
It's as if we're starting it over

471
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:03,819
It's very important that nobody says anything

472
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:09,740
Call me

473
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:20,220
Ha ha ha imagine if I get a

474
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:24,380
Imagine I get another two hours go by and it's like, ah, I hate this. I have to leave

475
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:27,420
And I can never play halo

476
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:30,680
Oh, that's fucking funny

477
00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:33,210
I'll never see the end of halo reach

478
00:33:34,150 --> 00:33:38,390
Everybody that ever I ever try to play with just humors me for two hours and then doesn't want to play anymore

479
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:42,500
That's that's very funny

480
00:33:43,619 --> 00:33:46,579
We'll see what happens tomorrow. I'll put a few lines out

481
00:33:54,039 --> 00:33:56,039
That's making me laugh though

482
00:33:57,210 --> 00:33:59,210
I'll throw a few lines up tomorrow. We'll see

483
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:14,219
That's so fucking funny. Yeah, that's me somebody that hasn't played it

484
00:34:18,489 --> 00:34:22,489
Hey, yeah, I decided to play it. Wait, where are you gonna play? I heard you can play halo reach yesterday

485
00:34:24,139 --> 00:34:25,590
No

486
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:29,429
No, I I decided uh, they were unforeseen circumstance. I know

487
00:34:30,389 --> 00:34:34,019
And I don't want to tell them anything and I and I really I really think that

488
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:37,380
I might get abandoned again, and that's funny

489
00:34:38,179 --> 00:34:41,909
What if I ask joel to do it again tomorrow?

490
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:50,230
Oh fuck i'm dead

491
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:52,699
What was the last thing I did?

492
00:34:52,699 --> 00:34:54,699
I didn't I didn't even save it. Did I? Yeah, I did

493
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,440
Just play solo

494
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:06,380
I can use a better weapon. Give me what's six. I want this thing. Yeah, this is better

495
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:16,760
Isn't it great? So I remember keep this in mind. You got to keep this very much in mind

496
00:35:17,239 --> 00:35:19,239
I have never played halos before

497
00:35:19,639 --> 00:35:22,519
My first experience that was my actual first halo experience

498
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:31,219
That's like going to buy all the best ingredients from the cake store

499
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:33,860
You go to the best bakery in the in town

500
00:35:36,570 --> 00:35:42,250
And then you instead of following the directions on the back of the cake mix thing with all the best ingredients

501
00:35:42,730 --> 00:35:44,730
You just put it all into a bowl

502
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:46,969
Mush it up with your hands

503
00:35:46,969 --> 00:35:51,449
Taste it say this tastes fucked up and gross and then throw it in the toilet

504
00:35:52,409 --> 00:36:05,269
That's that's the equivalent

505
00:36:05,269 --> 00:36:07,269
You're just sitting on the toilet

506
00:36:07,269 --> 00:36:17,019
Right didn't get him. Oh my god. How can I not hit you?

507
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:26,300
Wait, what happened? What do you say? What do you say?

508
00:36:28,099 --> 00:36:36,789
What do you say?

509
00:36:36,789 --> 00:36:39,429
Joel's in the chat. He called you a toilet

510
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:44,780
What do you mean? He like he called he just called me a toilet

511
00:36:46,019 --> 00:36:48,019
Or did he call me from the toilet?

512
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:50,500
I i'm confused

513
00:36:51,059 --> 00:36:58,469
I didn't even say fuck

514
00:36:58,469 --> 00:37:02,309
All right. I gotta focus. I guess this is a hard level hard level focus. Get out the grenade launcher

515
00:37:06,309 --> 00:37:08,309
Oh, you are the toilet

516
00:37:15,909 --> 00:37:17,590
All right big room opens

517
00:37:17,590 --> 00:37:30,199
Got it. Wait, what what is he is he is he?

518
00:37:31,909 --> 00:37:34,869
Even off even off stream. He's terrorizing my live stream

519
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:50,019
Even off even well off camera fuck that shield get down

520
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:57,130
I deserved it. I didn't do anything to deserve it

521
00:37:59,559 --> 00:38:02,090
Let's play halo

522
00:38:02,090 --> 00:38:03,769
everyone says

523
00:38:03,769 --> 00:38:07,369
Jeremy you gotta try halo. Oh, it's so fun. What like it's like one of the best

524
00:38:08,010 --> 00:38:12,250
Games ever this franchise is so good. I just wanted to play halo with a friend

525
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:25,530
That's all I wanted and then I was and then I was called names

526
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:32,150
two hours

527
00:38:32,530 --> 00:38:39,510
Nostalgia goggles, but okay that might that might be true. Maybe I don't know but I don't have any of those goggles

528
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:41,909
I never I didn't I didn't play it

529
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:46,150
I don't own a pair of those goggles

530
00:38:50,099 --> 00:38:52,099
I'm coming in with a pure

531
00:38:53,079 --> 00:38:55,079
No bullshit attitude

532
00:38:56,230 --> 00:39:00,309
No, like oh I did this already and it's that was fun. I know I got it

533
00:39:00,949 --> 00:39:05,429
They're not the best games ever, but they're great

534
00:39:05,909 --> 00:39:07,349
Yeah, we'll find out

535
00:39:07,349 --> 00:39:08,860
when I

536
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:10,860
Convince somebody else to play it tomorrow

537
00:39:12,059 --> 00:39:14,420
And pretend like it's the first time i've done it

538
00:39:15,219 --> 00:39:17,219
Or no, uh, uh, here's the here's the play

539
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,800
I just load it from my game

540
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:24,920
That I heard and just say that I did a little bit of it off screen

541
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,679
right

542
00:39:26,679 --> 00:39:32,699
That makes sense

543
00:39:32,699 --> 00:39:38,440
He's still in chat

544
00:39:38,519 --> 00:39:40,519
What do you what do you want from me?

545
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:46,469
Haven't you done enough?

546
00:39:46,469 --> 00:39:55,849
MonkaS

547
00:39:55,849 --> 00:39:59,559
All right this way this way this way say sorry

548
00:40:01,099 --> 00:40:04,460
Since when do you have to apologize for things that you aren't real?

549
00:40:10,039 --> 00:40:12,039
You're a booger streamer

550
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:14,579
Hey

551
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:26,570
easy

552
00:40:26,570 --> 00:40:28,650
Wait, they never even played halo

553
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:32,380
No, that was halo reach

554
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:35,530
first ever experience

555
00:40:35,610 --> 00:40:38,329
And you know what? I probably wouldn't have it any other way

556
00:40:39,050 --> 00:40:44,179
All right water release

557
00:40:44,179 --> 00:40:47,139
Good good good good good over here

558
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:53,539
I love the little spots to go in

559
00:40:54,679 --> 00:40:55,800
this way

560
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:56,679
No

561
00:40:56,679 --> 00:41:02,250
It was just a prank

562
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:09,190
I got ah, damn it

563
00:41:09,269 --> 00:41:11,960
Damn it. I got pranked

564
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:14,440
Where's the camera? Where is it? Which one just point? Where's the camera?

565
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:22,820
Right there. Okay

566
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:24,820
How are you still awake? Holy shit

567
00:41:25,539 --> 00:41:35,639
You're still awake

568
00:41:35,639 --> 00:41:39,050
It's late

569
00:41:39,050 --> 00:41:41,050
Joel is drunk. Wait, Joel was drinking?

570
00:41:45,429 --> 00:41:48,949
Hold on. I

571
00:41:48,949 --> 00:41:52,760
Joel was drinking

572
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:55,880
I don't play with streamers that drink. This is a i'm a dry channel

573
00:41:56,599 --> 00:41:58,599
Why wasn't that not told to me before?

574
00:42:04,599 --> 00:42:08,760
Actually kind of like annoyed by that in a way because why wouldn't somebody tell me?

575
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:18,340
Not be like serious like be serious

576
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:23,380
Was he actually drinking and and participating in a duo live stream with me?

577
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:34,170
I know maybe somebody came over from from Joel's stream, but we don't mess around with that

578
00:42:35,289 --> 00:42:39,030
Next you'll tell me that he's listens to rock music

579
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:41,349
And then okay

580
00:42:41,349 --> 00:42:42,789
Okay

581
00:42:42,789 --> 00:43:04,840
I'll believe that when I see it. Bye. All right. Bye

582
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:17,099
Is this door open? Wait, don't open yet

583
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:23,800
Now he's saying bye, but he's he actually he's not leaving see right now

584
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:26,280
he's going to take a shower or going to the bathroom

585
00:43:27,159 --> 00:43:33,079
And he brought his phone with him into the bathroom and this stream is still on and he's right now going like

586
00:43:34,599 --> 00:43:36,360
But you'll never know that

587
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:39,510
I right now i'm on the floor at max volume

588
00:43:40,309 --> 00:43:43,769
While he's taking a shower because he doesn't want to miss a second of germa 985

589
00:43:44,699 --> 00:43:49,099
So he turns the shower on so it's very low pressure and turns the volume up and puts the phone on the ground

590
00:43:49,099 --> 00:43:51,980
So it reverberates on the ground so you can still hear while you're in the shower

591
00:44:09,619 --> 00:44:11,860
and then you get pissed off because

592
00:44:12,820 --> 00:44:16,360
God damn it. I don't I I i'm watching this and

593
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:23,159
I'm thinking about just not cleaning myself to continue to watch this thing that i'm watching right now

594
00:44:30,630 --> 00:44:34,309
And then you go. No, no, no, no, whatever. I'll catch up later and then you you know

595
00:44:36,630 --> 00:44:38,070
Shower's too loud

596
00:44:38,070 --> 00:44:43,130
You're gonna do that's why I propose the next big thing

597
00:44:44,539 --> 00:44:45,900
Is gonna be

598
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:51,019
And i'm not talking about this is just for the rich like rich rich rich people. I'm talking about a monitor

599
00:44:51,739 --> 00:44:55,340
Like that like an ipad style tablet that's in your shower

600
00:44:58,010 --> 00:45:00,010
That is completely waterproof

601
00:45:00,489 --> 00:45:02,489
And it's like 60 bucks

602
00:45:02,969 --> 00:45:08,340
That's the next step

603
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:11,860
It exists. Yeah, but was it like a grand or something was it like two grand?

604
00:45:12,579 --> 00:45:14,420
i'm, not gonna buy that

605
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:17,059
I would buy it if it was like 40 bucks

606
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:27,320
What's happening what's happening seeing a lot of i'm seeing a lot of laughing faces

607
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:32,059
Just put your ipad in a plastic bag

608
00:45:33,130 --> 00:45:35,130
And what hold it?

609
00:45:36,099 --> 00:45:38,820
Put your ipad in a plastic bag and hold it with you in the shower

610
00:45:39,619 --> 00:45:46,219
Yeah, but that's messed up

611
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,960
Taking a shower with a monitor is normal

612
00:45:51,530 --> 00:45:55,210
Taking a shower with an ipad in a plastic bag is fucking weird

613
00:46:02,099 --> 00:46:04,900
No, if you have like i'm talking about if you had like a monitor like just in front of you

614
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:07,619
Where you you know, you got like your bar soap is right there

615
00:46:08,260 --> 00:46:14,739
Next to the bar soap is you know, your hair conditioner your shampoo and then there's just like a seven inch screen

616
00:46:14,820 --> 00:46:16,820
That's embedded into the wall

617
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:26,539
This is a bit. No, I mean I would want that

618
00:46:27,179 --> 00:46:30,519
I'm getting one

619
00:46:30,519 --> 00:46:32,519
Oh my god, there's a trap in here

620
00:46:34,469 --> 00:46:37,369
You have to be rich

621
00:46:37,369 --> 00:46:39,130
Uh, how do I get this?

622
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:46,170
And you didn't think I could do halo on fucking legendary

623
00:46:47,050 --> 00:47:01,739
You know, I think it's possible

624
00:47:01,739 --> 00:47:05,500
Hmm. This is me in my true environment

625
00:47:06,139 --> 00:47:16,059
Look at that one hit

626
00:47:16,059 --> 00:47:18,059
I used to believe but not anymore

627
00:47:25,619 --> 00:47:28,340
This is a really good just kind of background game, isn't it?

628
00:47:32,250 --> 00:47:34,809
The less I think about the game the better I do when I play it

629
00:47:35,369 --> 00:47:38,340
That's it

630
00:47:38,340 --> 00:47:42,980
Now I know a lot of people will definitely think that that was on purpose and I don't blame you at all. I really don't

631
00:47:43,929 --> 00:47:47,130
Because of how perfect was that for me to say that and then fall off the cliff

632
00:47:48,010 --> 00:47:50,010
I know that everyone thinks that that was on purpose

633
00:47:50,329 --> 00:47:53,690
so the only way I can avoid from being called up being like a

634
00:47:54,090 --> 00:47:56,170
Wow, nice like tuber joke you fucking loser

635
00:47:56,730 --> 00:48:00,809
I'm gonna just say that I did that on purpose because there's no way I could say they didn't

636
00:48:01,769 --> 00:48:14,869
And I didn't know where to start

637
00:48:15,110 --> 00:48:19,980
Reverse psychology

638
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:24,460
I could prove why it happened, but it won't be enough. It won't be enough

639
00:48:26,010 --> 00:48:28,250
I would never be able to get away from the sea

640
00:48:28,889 --> 00:48:32,010
the sea of germa iq span and lul

641
00:48:33,210 --> 00:48:35,929
It won't ever it'll be there and I will never be able to get away from it

642
00:48:55,099 --> 00:48:57,260
Joel versus germa doom deathmatch I would win

643
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:02,199
I would win. Absolutely

644
00:49:02,199 --> 00:49:05,159
You guys see I you guess I have experience so far, but

645
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:08,280
Do you really think that I I don't think you don't you don't think i'd be able to do that

646
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:15,619
Like did you see when I played I played dusk?

647
00:49:16,260 --> 00:49:21,219
And I played it at the hardest difficulty and I did and I remember people in the chat going like holy fuck man

648
00:49:21,219 --> 00:49:23,219
Like he actually is pretty good at this shit

649
00:49:24,980 --> 00:49:28,659
Like usually he falls off the edge and you can laugh but not this time

650
00:49:36,059 --> 00:49:41,429
Are you an egomaniac?

651
00:49:41,429 --> 00:49:42,630
I don't think so

652
00:49:42,630 --> 00:49:46,139
Is this a trap?

653
00:49:46,139 --> 00:49:53,699
Wait, go down. There it is

654
00:49:54,659 --> 00:49:56,900
All right. That is the gold key

655
00:49:59,139 --> 00:50:01,139
bombs even bombs

656
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:07,690
Actually, you know what?

657
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:15,820
No one said that

658
00:50:15,820 --> 00:50:17,099
I've

659
00:50:17,099 --> 00:50:18,780
I have logs

660
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:23,500
Of every stream. I have a log of every single thing anyone's ever said here

661
00:50:24,460 --> 00:50:26,219
if I type in

662
00:50:26,219 --> 00:50:28,340
the exact quote

663
00:50:28,340 --> 00:50:36,739
I didn't think he was going to be very good at this game. He actually is doing really well end quote search. Oh

664
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:40,940
41 results interesting

665
00:50:41,579 --> 00:50:47,260
This is the gold door. Oh, wait, wait, wait, save it

666
00:50:50,489 --> 00:50:53,110
Omega lol results

667
00:50:58,309 --> 00:51:00,469
Whoa, he just went real fast

668
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:15,780
Excuse me. Excuse me

669
00:51:16,900 --> 00:51:23,619
All right. What's your guys favorite weapon in the medieval?

670
00:51:26,199 --> 00:51:28,409
Mine's the sideways sword

671
00:51:28,409 --> 00:51:30,489
Or uh, also known as green door

672
00:51:35,929 --> 00:51:37,929
Grenade launcher. That's pretty good, too. You're right

673
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:41,480
Wish me. Good night. Have a great night

674
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:43,480
Good night

675
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:55,769
And we're we're we're lost the way got you

676
00:51:57,110 --> 00:51:59,190
Oh shucks. Thanks. You're very welcome

677
00:51:59,829 --> 00:52:08,599
Have a great one the golf club

678
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:10,840
What's the golf club?

679
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:16,230
When I when you when yes when I sneeze you don't say bless you

680
00:52:16,949 --> 00:52:19,900
I can't hear you sneezing

681
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:29,559
I don't know if you're sneezing or not

682
00:52:29,559 --> 00:52:33,079
Get up here. Yeah, I opened the green door. So what?

683
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:40,469
Where do I go now?

684
00:52:40,469 --> 00:52:42,469
Just say it every few minutes just in case

685
00:52:43,989 --> 00:52:45,989
I mean that would probably work but

686
00:52:46,070 --> 00:52:50,380
Did this open now?

687
00:52:50,380 --> 00:52:53,260
I think I didn't press a button. I saw one and I didn't press it

688
00:52:55,849 --> 00:53:00,010
No, it's this way

689
00:53:00,570 --> 00:53:02,570
Germa am I am you okay?

690
00:53:04,869 --> 00:53:06,869
Yeah, i'm good. What?

691
00:53:12,650 --> 00:53:14,579
He's not all right

692
00:53:14,579 --> 00:53:16,579
That's what he would say if he was not. All right

693
00:53:16,739 --> 00:53:29,019
Oh shit

694
00:53:29,019 --> 00:53:32,539
Joel's still watching. Yeah, Joel's phone at this point. He put it in his toilet

695
00:53:33,099 --> 00:53:35,579
So the reverberations from the bowl in the water

696
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:40,619
Fill up the bowl and then it's like a big speaker aiming up like a satellite into the bathroom

697
00:53:41,579 --> 00:53:48,309
He puts it in a plastic bag though. So it's fine. Don't worry

698
00:53:53,460 --> 00:54:03,320
Wait, hold on need help

699
00:54:06,519 --> 00:54:08,380
5g toilet

700
00:54:08,380 --> 00:54:14,550
I mean you guys laugh, but don't you think the most important place for you to have

701
00:54:16,059 --> 00:54:18,380
Better wireless coverage is in your bathroom

702
00:54:20,780 --> 00:54:24,699
I'm going to be completely and totally real with you here. This is this is not made up. This is not a joke

703
00:54:26,019 --> 00:54:28,840
My cell phone

704
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:32,679
Is used I would say me actually taking my phone

705
00:54:33,559 --> 00:54:35,559
out of my pocket or

706
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:38,360
Just looking at my phone screen

707
00:54:38,599 --> 00:54:39,719
happens

708
00:54:39,719 --> 00:54:42,119
50 to 60 percent of the time when i'm sitting on the toilet

709
00:54:44,230 --> 00:54:45,510
That's a fact

710
00:54:45,510 --> 00:54:55,639
I need silver key

711
00:54:55,639 --> 00:54:57,880
That's because

712
00:54:57,880 --> 00:55:01,159
No, no, I just that that's just the only time I use it. That's that's the time where it's like, all right

713
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:03,480
What's going on right now?

714
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:05,480
I don't have to pay attention to anything

715
00:55:05,639 --> 00:55:09,800
It's not like i'm doing something that's the time where I have that's my telephone time

716
00:55:10,679 --> 00:55:12,840
If you've had a conversation with me on the phone

717
00:55:13,639 --> 00:55:18,920
There is a very large chance that I was sitting on the toilet while I was talking to you

718
00:55:21,110 --> 00:55:26,150
And then I get a little self-conscious about it because you can hear the echo of you're in a bathroom echo

719
00:55:28,739 --> 00:55:32,739
And you try to mitigate that a little bit by there's different techniques you can use

720
00:55:33,139 --> 00:55:42,949
Oh, man, it's time. It's time. It's time. It's time. It's time. It's time. It's time. It's time. It's time

721
00:55:43,670 --> 00:55:45,670
Here we go

722
00:55:46,869 --> 00:55:54,730
Keep going move move move move move who else you

723
00:55:55,849 --> 00:55:58,570
Oh, I just fucking yeeted that guy

724
00:56:01,159 --> 00:56:03,239
In quotes and brackets. He says that to be

725
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:06,280
Look like he's part of the younger generation

726
00:56:06,679 --> 00:56:27,159
Okay, wait, I need that. There it is

727
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:29,750
All right back to that little pod

728
00:56:32,570 --> 00:56:34,570
Well, i'm not allowed to say yeet

729
00:56:34,809 --> 00:56:38,900
And why is that

730
00:56:40,570 --> 00:56:48,010
Things I can't say some things I can say

731
00:56:53,139 --> 00:56:55,780
What does this mean? That means it's like a secret over here, right?

732
00:57:05,780 --> 00:57:10,739
It means yes

733
00:57:10,739 --> 00:57:12,739
That's pac-man lol

734
00:57:15,579 --> 00:57:17,900
You know, what's really weird about the word you just said lol

735
00:57:18,780 --> 00:57:20,780
If I say lol

736
00:57:20,940 --> 00:57:24,380
Everybody laughs at me and they go wow. Look at this guy trying to use lol. That's

737
00:57:25,420 --> 00:57:28,300
That was like the internet slang when I was like younger

738
00:57:29,619 --> 00:57:32,179
Why am I why can't I say lol

739
00:57:32,179 --> 00:57:35,539
That's a word that I should I should be able to say that because that's like what we said

740
00:57:36,340 --> 00:57:45,050
Well, it's old internet slang. Yeah

741
00:57:45,289 --> 00:57:48,730
It means laugh out loud and if I say laugh out loud people go wow

742
00:57:49,449 --> 00:57:54,260
He's actually he said lol and then I go. All right. Well, i'll do l u l

743
00:57:54,739 --> 00:57:58,659
Get away from get away from me in my generation and I go fuck. Okay. Haha

744
00:57:59,619 --> 00:58:01,219
That's sarcastic

745
00:58:01,219 --> 00:58:03,210
No, um

746
00:58:03,210 --> 00:58:05,210
I'm took I thought that was funny

747
00:58:08,469 --> 00:58:12,500
All right, where's that silver door over here? There are rules

748
00:58:16,070 --> 00:58:20,099
Who am I talking to?

749
00:58:20,099 --> 00:58:22,710
um

750
00:58:22,710 --> 00:58:23,909
Shit, I don't know

751
00:58:23,909 --> 00:58:35,380
So what did that do?

752
00:58:35,380 --> 00:58:37,139
Yeah, nobody in particular

753
00:58:37,139 --> 00:58:44,150
I'm just sort of speaking

754
00:58:44,150 --> 00:58:45,750
Oh, let me get it

755
00:58:45,750 --> 00:58:47,750
I missed it. I missed it twice

756
00:58:48,070 --> 00:58:52,659
I mean that would have been great if I got them all if I bowled it in the right

757
00:58:53,699 --> 00:58:56,500
Oh, I did it zero secrets. God damn it

758
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:03,340
You're talking to yourself

759
00:59:03,340 --> 00:59:07,380
What's the title of this frame?

760
00:59:07,380 --> 00:59:25,019
right now

761
00:59:25,019 --> 00:59:26,539
Oh

762
00:59:26,539 --> 00:59:28,539
Reach with training wheels on

763
00:59:31,110 --> 00:59:33,110
You could describe this stream as that

764
00:59:36,619 --> 00:59:39,179
You could that was what this what that was

765
00:59:40,300 --> 00:59:42,380
Okay title change the title to

766
00:59:44,579 --> 00:59:51,019
um

767
00:59:51,019 --> 00:59:55,900
Should I make the name the title see you tomorrow? That's kind of accurate

768
00:59:56,460 --> 01:00:05,019
All right. How about um

769
01:00:05,019 --> 01:00:07,670
play reach

770
01:00:07,670 --> 01:00:09,110
How about just?

771
01:00:09,110 --> 01:00:14,420
uh

772
01:00:14,420 --> 01:00:18,440
hopping around

773
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:20,539
with

774
01:00:20,539 --> 01:00:24,059
My stick no hopping around fps

775
01:00:24,780 --> 01:00:26,780
fps indie game

776
01:00:26,860 --> 01:00:28,860
old school style fps indie

777
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:31,739
game fps styled

778
01:00:31,739 --> 01:00:36,679
shooter hard game

779
01:00:36,679 --> 01:00:37,960
Wapping around

780
01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:39,320
That's good

781
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:51,510
Wapping around is fine. Now. What am I at? All right, let's go

782
01:00:58,139 --> 01:01:05,559
I like this level. This level's big

783
01:01:06,679 --> 01:01:19,849
Is it difficulty on here?

784
01:01:19,849 --> 01:01:21,130
uh

785
01:01:21,130 --> 01:01:22,570
hard

786
01:01:22,570 --> 01:01:26,090
Just on hard. I think there's one after it, but I didn't I couldn't find it

787
01:01:26,809 --> 01:01:28,940
It's legendary

788
01:01:28,940 --> 01:01:30,920
legendary halo

789
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:39,340
It's on baby mode. This one's not on baby mode

790
01:01:40,219 --> 01:01:41,820
I can assure you

791
01:01:41,820 --> 01:01:56,519
Prove it. How do I?

792
01:01:57,130 --> 01:02:00,230
How do I prove that?

793
01:02:00,230 --> 01:02:04,309
Any news on the king stream? Yes, I do actually do have something to say

794
01:02:05,110 --> 01:02:06,849
it is on

795
01:02:06,849 --> 01:02:09,980
schedule

796
01:02:09,980 --> 01:02:14,139
So there was a thought that maybe it would have to be pushed potentially like a week or so maybe

797
01:02:14,780 --> 01:02:16,780
But we're still on schedule

798
01:02:17,500 --> 01:02:19,659
And next week is going to be the real

799
01:02:20,619 --> 01:02:23,659
testing and setting up the white listing stuff

800
01:02:25,260 --> 01:02:29,179
It's actually apparently according to what i've been told it's probably gonna be pretty easy to do

801
01:02:31,099 --> 01:02:33,690
So they're working on it should be good to go

802
01:02:34,650 --> 01:02:46,980
What do I think will happen?

803
01:02:47,059 --> 01:02:50,340
uh, I have a few theories on what I think will happen on that stream, but

804
01:02:51,139 --> 01:02:54,340
let's let them let's let them just let them be out there right just

805
01:02:55,699 --> 01:03:00,099
I'd rather it happen naturally and occur the way that it was going to occur

806
01:03:00,659 --> 01:03:14,760
Oh shit

807
01:03:14,760 --> 01:03:16,260
Open

808
01:03:16,260 --> 01:03:18,260
Oh, that's it. I need this

809
01:03:21,340 --> 01:03:24,469
I haven't even used any of this

810
01:03:24,550 --> 01:03:26,539
once

811
01:03:26,539 --> 01:03:29,099
This is gonna be a month in the making for a five minute stream

812
01:03:30,619 --> 01:03:32,619
I don't I don't think so

813
01:03:33,349 --> 01:03:35,210
I don't think so

814
01:03:35,210 --> 01:03:37,210
regardless of what happens just

815
01:03:38,199 --> 01:03:39,320
just know

816
01:03:39,320 --> 01:03:41,590
is uh

817
01:03:41,590 --> 01:03:43,590
It don't matter. It'll be fun regardless

818
01:03:49,059 --> 01:03:56,789
I would use yeah, let's just use it didn't kill him. What that should have killed all three of you

819
01:03:59,320 --> 01:04:00,840
That's bullshit

820
01:04:00,840 --> 01:04:11,960
Who's coming who's here?

821
01:04:12,599 --> 01:04:20,980
How's the server info gonna work?

822
01:04:21,619 --> 01:04:24,699
um

823
01:04:24,699 --> 01:04:28,619
Not 100 sure yet and I don't want to give info that's inaccurate so

824
01:04:29,820 --> 01:04:34,219
Next week around i'd say like six or seven days from right now. I'll have more

825
01:04:35,260 --> 01:04:37,260
actual concrete information

826
01:04:37,260 --> 01:04:40,619
So I don't want to be like, oh this is how it's going to work and it's like no that that is not

827
01:04:41,099 --> 01:04:42,539
How it's going to work?

828
01:04:42,539 --> 01:04:43,420
so

829
01:04:43,420 --> 01:04:46,139
I'd rather give you the details when they're actually they actually exist

830
01:04:47,260 --> 01:04:52,340
You need a king stream explanation. Sure thing

831
01:04:53,960 --> 01:04:54,760
so

832
01:04:54,760 --> 01:04:56,760
Uh, it is set for

833
01:04:57,320 --> 01:04:59,320
December 15th is the first one

834
01:05:00,039 --> 01:05:03,320
It is this it's going to be a potential series

835
01:05:03,960 --> 01:05:05,400
where

836
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:07,400
the goal is to

837
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:09,400
Just exist in a town

838
01:05:09,639 --> 01:05:13,800
Uh in a 500 to a thousand person minecraft server

839
01:05:14,679 --> 01:05:16,760
concurrent connections

840
01:05:16,760 --> 01:05:22,360
and the goal is for me to just exist as the king and for people to be uh loyal subjects

841
01:05:23,719 --> 01:05:25,719
And if I die then it's over

842
01:05:34,469 --> 01:05:35,670
so

843
01:05:35,670 --> 01:05:38,150
And there are things in place that I don't want to talk about

844
01:05:39,670 --> 01:05:40,869
to

845
01:05:40,869 --> 01:05:43,829
People think oh wow, you're just gonna die in two minutes

846
01:05:44,630 --> 01:05:49,530
Not so sure about that

847
01:05:49,530 --> 01:05:52,889
It's not just i'm gonna turn the server on turn around and run in the direction

848
01:05:54,579 --> 01:05:57,440
No, i'm gonna have personal bodyguards

849
01:05:58,139 --> 01:06:01,590
There's gonna be an aging system in the game

850
01:06:04,440 --> 01:06:06,519
Uh, where's this gold key? Have I not seen it?

851
01:06:10,170 --> 01:06:14,809
And i'm told all this stuff that's happening is doing very well and it's on point and it's almost ready to go

852
01:06:15,610 --> 01:06:19,380
How did I miss a key? Where did I miss?

853
01:06:19,940 --> 01:06:25,929
this way

854
01:06:25,929 --> 01:06:31,050
How do I open that? How do I get up here?

855
01:06:31,530 --> 01:06:34,650
I had to have missed something

856
01:06:34,650 --> 01:06:36,650
Minecraft. Oh this here gone

857
01:06:37,750 --> 01:06:39,750
Minecraft boomers

858
01:06:40,869 --> 01:06:45,510
Well, minecraft is the only game where this can probably physically work

859
01:06:47,510 --> 01:06:50,469
I was looking at a lot of different titles stuff like

860
01:06:51,750 --> 01:06:53,750
arc and conan exiles

861
01:06:55,960 --> 01:07:03,400
Minecraft is one of the only games that would probably even have the capability to have more than three four five hundred people

862
01:07:04,199 --> 01:07:06,119
In the same spot concurrently at the same time

863
01:07:08,679 --> 01:07:12,039
And this is also the first one the first attempt to do this

864
01:07:13,340 --> 01:07:18,619
If it works out well, and it's really fun this plans to add a shitload more stuff to it and do it like on a once a

865
01:07:18,619 --> 01:07:35,179
week basis

866
01:07:35,179 --> 01:07:37,179
Yeah, this like rust

867
01:07:37,239 --> 01:07:38,860
gmod

868
01:07:38,860 --> 01:07:44,539
But minecraft is so easily easily manipulatable with plugins and mods

869
01:07:45,500 --> 01:07:48,139
That we figured it might be might be the easiest one to start with

870
01:07:49,260 --> 01:07:51,260
And we're gonna go from there

871
01:07:54,010 --> 01:08:02,300
Press this button. Yeah, and also everybody also does have minecraft like if

872
01:08:02,300 --> 01:08:04,500
if

873
01:08:04,500 --> 01:08:06,500
If you have a computer

874
01:08:06,980 --> 01:08:12,179
And it's played a video game on it more than once you probably have minecraft on some account somewhere

875
01:08:15,690 --> 01:08:18,569
It also doesn't take very much to run it. Uh, I need to get up there

876
01:08:19,210 --> 01:08:28,310
How do I get up there? There's a button. Where's this? Where's the button? There's a button

877
01:08:37,960 --> 01:08:40,329
Minecraft is very laggy

878
01:08:40,409 --> 01:08:42,329
Yeah, i've been told

879
01:08:42,329 --> 01:08:45,930
That there are going to be things to uh help mitigate that

880
01:08:47,050 --> 01:08:52,409
I've been told there is a bunch of things to selectively render things and free up space

881
01:08:53,289 --> 01:08:55,289
These these these guys seem to know what they're doing

882
01:08:58,630 --> 01:08:59,829
We'll see

883
01:08:59,829 --> 01:09:01,829
Look, it's a big experiment

884
01:09:02,069 --> 01:09:04,069
But it's one that I I want to try

885
01:09:04,310 --> 01:09:06,550
I feel like it could be fucking fun and hilarious. No matter what

886
01:09:08,199 --> 01:09:13,399
He's been told by insider sources. That's correct. Who are these guys? They are minecraft

887
01:09:14,279 --> 01:09:15,640
server and

888
01:09:15,640 --> 01:09:17,640
mod plugin developers

889
01:09:18,439 --> 01:09:24,859
That's what I refer to these guys. All right, let's get in that door

890
01:09:33,829 --> 01:09:36,069
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa, where did you come from?

891
01:09:36,789 --> 01:09:52,279
notch cameo

892
01:09:55,239 --> 01:09:58,199
I'm gonna be surprised if notch didn't remember his minecraft password

893
01:10:02,069 --> 01:10:05,590
No, no, there's no that's not a thing. Let me quell that

894
01:10:10,739 --> 01:10:16,949
shit

895
01:10:16,949 --> 01:10:25,369
I am an account

896
01:10:25,369 --> 01:10:28,489
What is notch up to these days? Is he making any new games or anything?

897
01:10:39,930 --> 01:10:42,810
He's living he lives alone in his candy room

898
01:10:43,770 --> 01:10:49,539
What what do you mean you mean he had like a room willy he had a house willy wonka style made out of candy

899
01:10:50,659 --> 01:10:52,659
like an edible home

900
01:11:02,329 --> 01:11:03,609
Probably

901
01:11:03,609 --> 01:11:09,430
I love that's not real but that answer to that is probably

902
01:11:11,220 --> 01:11:27,659
Oh man, he took off my fucking head. All right, don't fuck this up

903
01:11:28,380 --> 01:11:31,500
Give me give me the stick the stick. I want the stick

904
01:11:32,380 --> 01:11:33,819
Give me the stick

905
01:11:33,819 --> 01:11:38,140
No, the wrong stick. I don't have any ammo for the stick. That's why all right. I get it. Let's go

906
01:11:38,779 --> 01:12:03,340
Room in here shit

907
01:12:03,420 --> 01:12:04,539
two

908
01:12:04,539 --> 01:12:05,579
Three

909
01:12:05,579 --> 01:12:12,810
All right. Good. He beat halo. It was really good

910
01:12:15,380 --> 01:12:17,380
Now I understand what the hype is all about

911
01:12:17,619 --> 01:12:27,050
This room is moving now

912
01:12:27,050 --> 01:12:31,689
Oh shit

913
01:12:31,689 --> 01:12:33,689
Really kind of a short game

914
01:12:34,090 --> 01:12:36,520
What was that an hour and 40 minutes?

915
01:12:38,170 --> 01:12:56,260
I was I thought it was gonna be a little longer. Don't worry. We had we had the medieval backup

916
01:13:09,159 --> 01:13:10,760
What really happened?

917
01:13:10,760 --> 01:13:13,899
Oh, you may not have been here. Uh, joel hates halo

918
01:13:21,109 --> 01:13:30,170
Uh

919
01:13:30,170 --> 01:13:35,720
What really happened? You know any explanation as to what actually happened?

920
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:39,000
Can just get muddy to not even being real

921
01:13:39,960 --> 01:13:42,060
That's the weird part

922
01:13:42,060 --> 01:13:47,500
Any way to explain why i'm not playing halo reach right now could come off as not even real

923
01:13:47,979 --> 01:13:51,180
Like oh, that's that's made up joke. That's a joke. Okay, that's funny

924
01:13:52,220 --> 01:13:55,800
All right, this guy's pissing me off

925
01:14:04,250 --> 01:14:06,569
Oh this place is stupid. Okay

926
01:14:07,529 --> 01:14:17,380
Looking for a key

927
01:14:17,380 --> 01:14:20,020
German turn on warrior mode it improves the game

928
01:14:20,899 --> 01:14:23,939
What does it do?

929
01:14:23,939 --> 01:14:25,939
Was it the latency?

930
01:14:26,020 --> 01:14:27,689
Yeah

931
01:14:27,689 --> 01:14:30,729
Yeah, do you want the real of the real answer?

932
01:14:33,770 --> 01:14:41,609
the p2 the p2 pants latency was like a lot and clicking your mouse and firing the weapon happened like

933
01:14:42,489 --> 01:14:43,609
like

934
01:14:43,609 --> 01:14:45,609
Probably a half second after you did it

935
01:14:48,010 --> 01:14:54,899
That's the real answer

936
01:14:54,899 --> 01:14:58,340
Oh, whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa, where where where where where?

937
01:15:04,649 --> 01:15:05,930
Don't die here

938
01:15:05,930 --> 01:15:07,130
please

939
01:15:07,130 --> 01:15:11,829
I need that help

940
01:15:11,829 --> 01:15:14,229
Oh, okay. These jumps are a little tricky

941
01:15:15,189 --> 01:15:17,880
Didn't make it

942
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:24,149
The game has a bug where p2p has a lot of input delay

943
01:15:25,109 --> 01:15:26,390
Yeah

944
01:15:26,390 --> 01:15:28,390
So it's probably for the best

945
01:15:28,550 --> 01:15:32,569
But still but still

946
01:15:34,840 --> 01:15:36,920
Uh, can I make that jump? Let's find out

947
01:15:38,140 --> 01:15:54,060
Well, we'll find out in a second

948
01:15:54,060 --> 01:15:56,699
I didn't even get it. How did I not get it?

949
01:15:58,579 --> 01:16:01,539
This my body's too big. My body's big enough to

950
01:16:13,189 --> 01:16:16,710
I gotta make this out of

951
01:16:16,710 --> 01:16:18,949
I'm gonna die. Just kill me kill me kill me kill me kill me

952
01:16:22,789 --> 01:16:25,539
Okay, let's do this first

953
01:16:25,939 --> 01:16:33,590
Where is it right here?

954
01:16:33,590 --> 01:16:37,770
125 health wow 200 health actually. Holy shit. That was very that was very worth doing

955
01:16:38,489 --> 01:16:40,970
Very much. So give me my stick

956
01:16:52,390 --> 01:16:54,310
Bring me um here

957
01:16:54,310 --> 01:16:56,710
That's the best boss ever in a video game

958
01:16:58,199 --> 01:16:59,560
It's pretty close

959
01:16:59,560 --> 01:17:02,439
All right. Now we're gonna do this again

960
01:17:10,140 --> 01:17:13,260
All roads lead to this over clean up detail

961
01:17:15,779 --> 01:17:28,409
Not today though. Where is it? Get oh shit

962
01:17:31,079 --> 01:17:33,079
the original spill joke

963
01:17:34,920 --> 01:17:41,380
joke

964
01:17:41,380 --> 01:17:43,220
Where are you? Get up here

965
01:17:43,220 --> 01:17:46,579
I knew I knew you I both of you I knew you were both coming from here and I still all right

966
01:17:46,579 --> 01:17:48,579
My hand's getting stuck under my desk

967
01:18:07,460 --> 01:18:09,699
Somebody knows what I mean by that

968
01:18:09,699 --> 01:18:10,899
so

969
01:18:10,899 --> 01:18:15,619
Uh, I have one of those pull out things under the under the desk that you slide in and out

970
01:18:16,420 --> 01:18:19,619
And sometimes when i'm gaming really hard it pushes back in

971
01:18:20,340 --> 01:18:23,779
So then I end up when I lift my mouth up it on the top

972
01:18:24,500 --> 01:18:27,699
You know underneath the desk

973
01:18:28,260 --> 01:18:39,260
When you're gaming really hard

974
01:18:39,260 --> 01:18:41,260
Okay, this is gonna be speaking of hard

975
01:18:41,659 --> 01:18:45,020
This looks like a really shitty room that I wish I had held on to most of my

976
01:18:46,619 --> 01:18:48,619
Stuff I like to use

977
01:18:48,699 --> 01:18:50,859
Because there are arrows just flying over here

978
01:18:51,819 --> 01:18:53,979
Oh, yeah, yeah

979
01:18:53,979 --> 01:18:55,420
Oh, yeah

980
01:18:55,420 --> 01:18:59,260
I gotta go right down a little

981
01:18:59,260 --> 01:19:13,500
Don't block it back at me

982
01:19:13,500 --> 01:19:17,180
Oh, never mind. I thought these were all enemies aiming fire arrows at me

983
01:19:18,229 --> 01:19:30,649
I'm good

984
01:19:30,649 --> 01:19:33,340
Is german like anime?

985
01:19:33,340 --> 01:19:37,829
Uh, yes once a year look at that fucking kill

986
01:19:38,550 --> 01:19:52,390
Once a year

987
01:19:52,390 --> 01:19:56,710
I'm just kind of i'm just i'm chilling right now. This I feel actually I feel pretty good

988
01:19:57,590 --> 01:20:01,819
You know, you just hit that kind of mode where you just you're just chilling

989
01:20:03,270 --> 01:20:10,579
My utter and severe and sheer disappointment with playing with Joel is not I feel pretty great right now

990
01:20:21,340 --> 01:20:22,380
Uh-oh

991
01:20:22,380 --> 01:20:28,010
What happened?

992
01:20:28,010 --> 01:20:39,319
All right. Here's what really happened. Oh my god

993
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:49,220
You know what? Let's see if we can get it

994
01:20:49,220 --> 01:21:03,880
You should see my face right now

995
01:21:03,880 --> 01:21:05,880
What are you doing over there?

996
01:21:06,279 --> 01:21:11,239
He's face cam face cam tease

997
01:21:18,100 --> 01:21:20,439
I don't want to pick that up

998
01:21:20,439 --> 01:21:23,560
Should I though? I mean no, I that's a that's a free refill

999
01:21:23,880 --> 01:21:25,880
Why would I pick up a free refill right now?

1000
01:21:27,609 --> 01:21:30,409
I don't think I maybe I can't come. I don't know whatever just get it

1001
01:21:31,529 --> 01:21:33,579
What?

1002
01:21:33,579 --> 01:21:35,579
I oh it's a fly. I can fly

1003
01:21:36,060 --> 01:21:42,140
Oh

1004
01:21:42,140 --> 01:21:45,369
I get it. There's a timer on this too

1005
01:21:51,899 --> 01:21:53,899
Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on

1006
01:21:53,979 --> 01:21:57,430
I'm not gonna do it. I'm not gonna do it

1007
01:21:57,989 --> 01:21:59,109
It's all right

1008
01:21:59,109 --> 01:22:10,630
Just wait for it to respawn

1009
01:22:10,630 --> 01:22:13,130
Sequence complete. Can I like leave?

1010
01:22:13,770 --> 01:22:20,250
What did that do?

1011
01:22:20,250 --> 01:22:22,010
fizzy lifting drigs

1012
01:22:22,010 --> 01:22:24,890
Well, not quite

1013
01:22:24,890 --> 01:22:29,640
up

1014
01:22:29,640 --> 01:22:32,579
I ran out of gas

1015
01:22:32,579 --> 01:23:00,659
I have like no ammo for anything

1016
01:23:00,659 --> 01:23:03,000
Excuse me

1017
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,000
Oh fuck. I forgot I was floating

1018
01:23:06,119 --> 01:23:08,920
No, no, no, no, no you stop moving you die. Just stop moving you die

1019
01:23:09,560 --> 01:23:14,729
Let me pick up all this shit

1020
01:23:14,729 --> 01:23:22,020
I'll get it back immediately

1021
01:23:22,260 --> 01:23:28,180
I need ammo

1022
01:23:28,180 --> 01:23:30,180
5g wizard wand

1023
01:23:30,180 --> 01:23:31,699
That's the one

1024
01:23:31,699 --> 01:23:36,819
I like this room. I like this room, too

1025
01:23:37,539 --> 01:23:39,859
I like this whole level. That's probably my favorite so far

1026
01:23:40,659 --> 01:23:43,859
There's a lot of verticality

1027
01:23:44,100 --> 01:23:46,100
As they say right

1028
01:23:56,859 --> 01:23:58,859
Bounce it around and then

1029
01:24:03,210 --> 01:24:05,210
They do say that yeah, they do

1030
01:24:05,850 --> 01:24:15,619
I'm giving the wings

1031
01:24:15,619 --> 01:24:17,619
I like you. Hey, thanks

1032
01:24:18,710 --> 01:24:20,470
You're not so bad yourself

1033
01:24:20,470 --> 01:24:26,180
How does that sound?

1034
01:24:26,180 --> 01:24:28,340
Jeremy you have to be funny or your sponsor is watching

1035
01:24:28,979 --> 01:24:36,470
Why would my why would my sponsor want me to be funny?

1036
01:24:37,979 --> 01:24:42,619
Do they they only pay me sponsorship money if they think my stream is funny?

1037
01:24:47,189 --> 01:24:49,350
Imagine the rules imagine what that contract would be

1038
01:24:51,640 --> 01:24:57,000
Yes, uh, the ceo of the company's gonna come into your stream every time you stream and at least once he has to audibly laugh

1039
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:58,119
In the office

1040
01:24:58,119 --> 01:25:00,119
Or we rip your contract in half

1041
01:25:06,920 --> 01:25:08,920
That's some weirdo billionaire shit

1042
01:25:09,399 --> 01:25:25,319
Hey Jeremy, i'm frank here with

1043
01:25:25,319 --> 01:25:30,039
In warrior mode, you don't keep your weapons on each level and each level has their own weapons

1044
01:25:33,079 --> 01:25:38,199
Oh, I see what you mean. So you don't get to just play with whatever you want. You have to get with what the level gives you

1045
01:25:38,279 --> 01:25:42,279
That's it

1046
01:25:42,279 --> 01:25:45,210
This is a boss

1047
01:25:45,210 --> 01:25:49,460
Has to be right?

1048
01:25:49,460 --> 01:25:52,789
All right, let's go

1049
01:25:52,789 --> 01:25:58,300
Solar saint

1050
01:25:58,699 --> 01:26:12,359
Oh, where's he going pick up everything got it. Got it. Got it. Got it. Got it. Got it. Got it. Got it

1051
01:26:20,340 --> 01:26:26,310
Oh

1052
01:26:26,310 --> 01:26:28,310
Help I have 20 health

1053
01:26:28,789 --> 01:26:31,699
Where's he going?

1054
01:26:31,699 --> 01:26:55,350
Okay, where is he?

1055
01:26:55,350 --> 01:26:57,350
oh, man, that's

1056
01:26:57,829 --> 01:27:06,729
That was really

1057
01:27:06,729 --> 01:27:08,100
That was

1058
01:27:08,100 --> 01:27:10,100
If you touch it, you're dead

1059
01:27:10,340 --> 01:27:14,619
I'm not sure I even like that

1060
01:27:14,619 --> 01:27:20,619
I'm not sure I like that one. Hold on. Let's try this again

1061
01:27:21,500 --> 01:27:23,500
Maybe I should just buy this item

1062
01:27:28,970 --> 01:27:31,449
No, this ain't working. No, that's the right idea

1063
01:27:32,010 --> 01:27:33,770
Uh kill me, please

1064
01:27:33,770 --> 01:27:42,899
What should I use against him?

1065
01:27:43,300 --> 01:27:47,220
I feel like this is probably gonna do the most damage but hold on let me go this way

1066
01:27:54,170 --> 01:27:56,409
Yeah, this is it

1067
01:27:59,449 --> 01:28:01,449
And no explosions to kill me instantly

1068
01:28:08,680 --> 01:28:25,909
Help dude, this is a little quick little head bash. You can't get that close

1069
01:28:26,630 --> 01:28:41,500
When does he do it he's gonna do it now just run in a circle

1070
01:28:45,720 --> 01:28:47,430
Oh

1071
01:28:47,430 --> 01:28:49,670
Oh, fuck. Okay, you gotta back up

1072
01:28:53,380 --> 01:28:55,380
You gotta back up. It's all about backtracking

1073
01:28:56,020 --> 01:29:02,359
Don't run underneath

1074
01:29:02,359 --> 01:29:12,710
Maybe just run by him

1075
01:29:23,350 --> 01:29:29,180
Stop shaking my screen

1076
01:29:31,819 --> 01:29:40,920
My face is itchy. I don't know what to do. Fuck

1077
01:29:44,329 --> 01:29:48,649
Holy fuck he just I can't believe he just timed that perfectly that sucked

1078
01:29:52,260 --> 01:29:54,659
How did he time that how did he time that so well?

1079
01:30:09,220 --> 01:30:24,500
Oh, fuck. I got him. God damn. I collect all the stuff. No, it doesn't matter

1080
01:30:28,060 --> 01:30:39,699
So should I try warrior mode? Should I activate it? Oh, damn it. That boss took me 60 tries

1081
01:30:43,539 --> 01:30:45,539
Hey, thanks for being a quote. I can pull later

1082
01:30:49,720 --> 01:30:51,720
This looks like we have what two or three more areas?

1083
01:30:54,489 --> 01:30:56,489
All right, so warrior mode, huh?

1084
01:30:57,300 --> 01:30:58,739
I'll give it a try

1085
01:30:58,739 --> 01:31:01,300
Warrior mode start each level with only the x

1086
01:31:04,970 --> 01:31:08,409
Oh, you have to in every level you have to pick up the weapons would you look at that?

1087
01:31:09,529 --> 01:31:11,850
All right. Where am I going?

1088
01:31:11,850 --> 01:31:17,289
It gives each level a unique flavor

1089
01:31:18,250 --> 01:31:21,140
I like flavors

1090
01:31:21,140 --> 01:31:23,140
All right. Oh

1091
01:31:23,140 --> 01:31:25,140
Sacred path sounds good to me

1092
01:31:25,619 --> 01:31:28,090
That sounds good to me

1093
01:31:28,090 --> 01:31:38,859
Taste the level journeyman's way

1094
01:31:39,739 --> 01:31:45,319
Oh, okay. And look we get my favorite weapon right off the bat

1095
01:31:46,279 --> 01:31:50,520
It's it's our what a delicious green apple flavor. I'm so happy to have this

1096
01:31:51,479 --> 01:31:59,020
I love that artificial almost poison like taste of green apple artificial flavoring

1097
01:31:59,979 --> 01:32:10,949
The best green apple flavoring is the one that you can taste in your nostrils

1098
01:32:11,670 --> 01:32:18,949
All right, so we're uh, where am I going? Am I gonna die if I go in there?

1099
01:32:23,640 --> 01:32:29,880
The journeyman's way leads to the apostle's shrine. Um, that's cool, man

1100
01:32:29,880 --> 01:32:32,920
But how am I supposed to get over there take the big bridge?

1101
01:32:41,029 --> 01:32:48,310
Uh elevator

1102
01:32:50,039 --> 01:33:00,279
Well, I got another weapon

1103
01:33:01,109 --> 01:33:05,689
Oh wait

1104
01:33:05,689 --> 01:33:08,090
He's not aware. No, I'm not

1105
01:33:08,979 --> 01:33:11,159
Can I kill this thing?

1106
01:33:14,260 --> 01:33:16,739
Shout out to all the weirdos who like fanta green apple

1107
01:33:20,359 --> 01:33:22,520
Yeah, that that does make you a weirdo. Doesn't it?

1108
01:33:29,859 --> 01:33:32,579
Yeah, I that's a weird. That is a weirdo barometer. You're right

1109
01:33:37,539 --> 01:33:39,640
random

1110
01:33:39,640 --> 01:33:41,640
green apple fanta

1111
01:33:45,930 --> 01:33:50,149
Yeah, um

1112
01:33:50,229 --> 01:33:52,789
Green apple fanta. I don't think i've even ever had it before

1113
01:33:54,569 --> 01:33:56,569
But I know it probably tastes

1114
01:33:57,210 --> 01:34:00,729
Like a liquid cold version of a jolly rancher

1115
01:34:01,609 --> 01:34:03,609
the green apple jolly rancher

1116
01:34:10,970 --> 01:34:15,529
You know that exact flavor i'm talking about but I feel like it's thick and syrupy and shit and I wouldn't want it in my mouth

1117
01:34:16,250 --> 01:34:20,279
Gotta find a gold key

1118
01:34:20,439 --> 01:34:30,039
What do we open? What do we open here? Ooh?

1119
01:34:30,760 --> 01:34:35,430
There's a timer. There's a timer on this

1120
01:34:38,729 --> 01:34:40,170
gold door

1121
01:34:40,170 --> 01:34:43,619
Where do I go from here?

1122
01:34:48,100 --> 01:34:50,729
No, there's no timer on this

1123
01:34:50,729 --> 01:34:54,579
Fanta is exotic

1124
01:34:54,579 --> 01:34:57,539
Uh, I don't know about Fanta exotic

1125
01:34:58,260 --> 01:35:02,100
Right. I want to get that right here

1126
01:35:03,659 --> 01:35:05,819
I missed it. It's like I was trying to go around it

1127
01:35:06,539 --> 01:35:13,189
All right. So where the fuck do I go?

1128
01:35:13,350 --> 01:35:26,699
Am I there? I guess I could go up here. This is where I came from. I think I go

1129
01:35:29,779 --> 01:35:34,100
Where no this way no

1130
01:35:35,060 --> 01:35:38,310
No, no

1131
01:35:38,310 --> 01:35:50,250
I don't want this way. And this is this out the back entrance

1132
01:35:54,329 --> 01:35:55,449
Wait

1133
01:35:55,449 --> 01:35:58,810
I can go up here. Did that move the shit around on the sides? I think it did. Yeah, it did how do

1134
01:36:00,539 --> 01:36:02,539
Yeah, I moved a bunch of shit all over the place

1135
01:36:02,779 --> 01:36:09,739
We're good. This is the second bonus stream

1136
01:36:12,819 --> 01:36:16,979
Uh, it kind of feels like this whole week so far has been uh

1137
01:36:17,939 --> 01:36:19,939
Just wait bonus stream

1138
01:36:20,500 --> 01:36:23,319
That's been the first couple streams this week

1139
01:36:23,960 --> 01:36:32,630
What is that noise?

1140
01:36:32,630 --> 01:36:35,579
This is not a cannon week

1141
01:36:35,579 --> 01:36:37,979
No, this is week. This week is not you're right. It's not canon

1142
01:36:40,180 --> 01:36:42,819
Well, I mean, you know you yeah you could yeah, you know, it was it was

1143
01:36:43,460 --> 01:36:47,560
We played we played with joel today

1144
01:36:48,199 --> 01:36:52,420
And he was very very angry

1145
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:57,000
Those who are lost never look upwards

1146
01:36:59,079 --> 01:37:01,079
Except for you because you're playing the game

1147
01:37:01,479 --> 01:37:08,649
That hurts

1148
01:37:08,649 --> 01:37:10,649
We heard joel scream today

1149
01:37:11,369 --> 01:37:32,060
screaming

1150
01:37:32,060 --> 01:37:34,699
So we oh, I don't really like this weapon

1151
01:37:35,939 --> 01:37:39,850
I don't like this flavor

1152
01:37:39,850 --> 01:37:41,850
See that if this thing is um

1153
01:37:42,729 --> 01:37:44,729
If this is like a green apple

1154
01:37:45,750 --> 01:37:48,390
This is like a crystal like rock candy

1155
01:37:49,590 --> 01:37:51,590
Crystal rock candy green apple

1156
01:37:52,619 --> 01:37:54,699
this thing

1157
01:37:54,699 --> 01:37:59,260
It's just like that sour paste like blue raspberry sour gel that you suck on

1158
01:37:59,739 --> 01:38:03,829
This stuff is gross

1159
01:38:03,829 --> 01:38:05,510
I would eat this

1160
01:38:05,510 --> 01:38:07,979
If it came down to whatever

1161
01:38:07,979 --> 01:38:13,050
I can't press this button

1162
01:38:13,050 --> 01:38:15,770
Blue raspberry is the best. Yeah, but not once that like gross gel

1163
01:38:17,050 --> 01:38:18,010
like

1164
01:38:18,010 --> 01:38:20,010
Oil that they put sugar in

1165
01:38:20,810 --> 01:38:25,029
And whip it up

1166
01:38:25,029 --> 01:38:27,029
It like uses cartilage or whatever the hell it is

1167
01:38:27,590 --> 01:38:31,500
Can I get up there? Oh, there's the key shit

1168
01:38:32,220 --> 01:38:40,869
Nothing to do. I can't get up there. This looks breakable. Can I blow this up?

1169
01:38:42,840 --> 01:38:44,840
That looks so breakable though, doesn't it?

1170
01:38:45,159 --> 01:38:49,380
What are my thoughts on sour candy?

1171
01:38:49,699 --> 01:38:52,439
I'm not a big fan of it

1172
01:38:52,439 --> 01:38:54,569
it's

1173
01:38:54,569 --> 01:39:05,979
I gotta undo that

1174
01:39:05,979 --> 01:39:08,340
Because sour is cool

1175
01:39:08,340 --> 01:39:10,340
But after you eat sour candy

1176
01:39:11,960 --> 01:39:13,159
you don't

1177
01:39:13,159 --> 01:39:15,159
You kind of just feel bad

1178
01:39:15,479 --> 01:39:16,920
for

1179
01:39:16,920 --> 01:39:18,920
Like at least 10 20 minutes after you eat it

1180
01:39:21,430 --> 01:39:23,430
Just something something feels off

1181
01:39:30,439 --> 01:39:32,619
The sides of my tongue

1182
01:39:32,699 --> 01:39:37,579
Underneath my tongue at the base of kind of where my jaw is connecting my tongue to my in my mouth

1183
01:39:38,380 --> 01:39:41,020
Is sore like I did a workout inside of my mouth

1184
01:39:43,449 --> 01:39:46,569
If I eat a really sour shit for more than a few minutes straight

1185
01:39:55,140 --> 01:39:57,140
Holy fuck this level is confusing

1186
01:39:59,109 --> 01:40:00,310
Uh

1187
01:40:00,310 --> 01:40:03,319
I think can I jump from

1188
01:40:06,069 --> 01:40:08,069
This is in here

01:41:37,460 --> 01:41:39,460
This is one of those puzzle levels, ain't it?

1200
01:41:42,840 --> 01:41:45,560
Well people spawned down here. So I think that's where I need to go

1201
01:41:46,600 --> 01:41:57,399
Right now what what did that button activate? Not bad

1202
01:41:58,199 --> 01:42:05,369
Did something else open down here?

1208
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:46,630
Let's go

1209
01:42:46,630 --> 01:42:48,630
Back up. Yeah

1210
01:42:49,109 --> 01:42:55,130
Damn it. I have to beat it up there. Don't I?

1211
01:42:55,449 --> 01:42:59,319
I gotta get up there. Go go go. I don't know which way it is. I don't remember

1212
01:43:00,220 --> 01:43:16,489
I don't know this way. I missed it. Have you tried spicy skittles? I don't know. I've not

1213
01:43:17,289 --> 01:43:21,369
All right. Well, I know where this is. No

1214
01:43:21,369 --> 01:43:24,220
Just go back down

1215
01:43:24,220 --> 01:43:26,739
Press the button

1216
01:43:26,739 --> 01:43:28,420
Beat it up there

1217
01:43:28,420 --> 01:43:38,819
Good. Look i'm smart

1218
01:43:39,699 --> 01:43:40,739
sometimes

1219
01:43:40,739 --> 01:43:48,579
It's not making me hungry

1220
01:43:48,579 --> 01:43:49,939
I think

1221
01:43:49,939 --> 01:43:54,739
If you don't talk, what do I go? No fucking god damn it. I started talking. I lost my opportunity now

1222
01:43:54,739 --> 01:43:57,220
I have to do this again. There's a little sliver right there

1223
01:44:05,449 --> 01:44:07,609
so smart

1224
01:44:07,609 --> 01:44:08,810
Hey

1225
01:44:08,810 --> 01:44:12,090
Distra you can be smart and get distracted

1226
01:44:14,859 --> 01:44:17,739
Being distracted does not equal low intelligence

1227
01:44:18,699 --> 01:44:22,859
It means i'm over here and then i'm over here and then i'm over here i'm over there and then i'm over there

1228
01:44:23,579 --> 01:44:45,850
Is there nothing up here?

1229
01:44:45,850 --> 01:44:48,409
uh

1230
01:44:48,409 --> 01:44:54,279
Now what? Freedom. I can't jump that high

1231
01:44:55,000 --> 01:45:05,720
I'm gonna go out to the main area. Oh, I got the key. I got the key key key key key key key key key key key

1232
01:45:07,109 --> 01:45:08,920

1233
01:45:08,920 --> 01:45:12,439
Key is over there. You press the button and it takes you up you get to go across

1234
01:45:13,399 --> 01:45:15,399
I remember I got the key. Don't worry

1235
01:45:21,500 --> 01:45:28,760
Here we go open

1236
01:45:28,760 --> 01:45:35,350
Good. There's the sword

shards wand

1241
01:45:53,079 --> 01:45:55,079
It's the most concentrated

1242
01:45:56,140 --> 01:45:58,140
What the fuck was that?

1243
01:46:02,630 --> 01:46:05,270
It's just super concentrated damage. Can I walk on this floor?

1244
01:46:06,069 --> 01:46:08,229
Can I?

1245
01:46:08,229 --> 01:46:12,680
Nope, I mean I can but not for very long

1246
01:46:13,319 --> 01:46:22,840
Wait, oh

1247
01:46:27,560 --> 01:46:29,560
No shit, you're spawning

1248
01:46:33,529 --> 01:46:36,779
Get out of here

Uh, keep scaling it

1250
01:46:43,909 --> 01:46:46,899

run out of ammo

1254
01:47:07,380 --> 01:47:09,380
I gotta get that health, too

1255
01:47:09,699 --> 01:47:11,699
Look, i'm gonna play on warrior mode

1256
01:47:12,340 --> 01:47:20,279
And there's nothing else up here

1257

1259
01:47:23,880 --> 01:47:25,880
Very very cool. I didn't bring oh

01:47:26,359 --> 01:47:28,359
I don't know why I decided I didn't bring

1261
01:47:28,840 --> 01:47:31,479
What like a underwear towel? What am I talking about?

1262
01:47:32,199 --> 01:47:35,939

1265
01:47:49,399 --> 01:47:53,619
Unless what?

1266
01:47:53,619 --> 01:47:54,579
That's

1267
01:47:54,579 --> 01:47:57,539
In the last haha. I don't uh, yeah, you're doing that thing

1268
01:47:58,739 --> 01:48:01,109
You're doing that thing

1269
01:48:01,270 --> 01:48:03,270
Now I know i'm aware now

1270
01:48:12,859 --> 01:48:14,859
Silver key, there's the silver door

1271
01:48:15,739 --> 01:48:19,829
But wait

1272
01:48:19,829 --> 01:48:22,149
Fire makes the vine creature stronger

1273
01:48:22,789 --> 01:48:25,220
So don't use fire use electricity

1274
01:48:27,220 --> 01:48:29,220
The way is clear yet murky

1275
01:48:29,619 --> 01:48:38,979
All right. Uh, anyone know what that is?

1276
01:48:39,619 --> 01:48:43,510
That's out in the main hall and it's connected over there and I don't know. I'll find it

1277
01:48:50,949 --> 01:48:56,810
Oh shit

1278
01:48:56,810 --> 01:48:58,810
Auto flame

1279
01:49:03,340 --> 01:49:06,300
Yes auto flame

1280
01:49:06,300 --> 01:49:08,140
Oh, I wanted to ask a question

1281
01:49:08,140 --> 01:49:10,819
Does anybody have any experience?

1282
01:49:11,430 --> 01:49:12,840
with

1283
01:49:12,840 --> 01:49:14,020
dog

1284
01:49:14,020 --> 01:49:16,020
Ancestry dna kits

1285
01:49:17,109 --> 01:49:18,550
Are they real?

1286
01:49:18,550 --> 01:49:36,439
Or is it just pretend?

1287
01:49:36,439 --> 01:49:38,199
Sounds like bullshit

1288
01:49:38,199 --> 01:49:40,520
My co-worker used them and talked about it for months

1289
01:49:41,399 --> 01:49:42,680
No one knows

1290
01:49:42,680 --> 01:49:48,039
Human ancestry kits aren't real. No, I think if i'm dog ancestry kits, i'm by the way

1291
01:49:49,399 --> 01:49:51,399
I don't see the appeal

1292
01:49:52,710 --> 01:49:55,399
I don't for me

1293
01:49:55,479 --> 01:49:57,479
I don't want to send in

1294
01:49:57,880 --> 01:50:01,000
My like saliva or my blood to some company

1295
01:50:01,960 --> 01:50:04,920
And then they have a genetic dna profile

1296
01:50:05,640 --> 01:50:07,640
They have my genetic code

1297
01:50:08,520 --> 01:50:12,920
Well, why are they collecting this info? What are they doing with it? What are you doing with my info?

1298
01:50:13,560 --> 01:50:23,159
Twitch has that already

1299
01:50:23,159 --> 01:50:26,680
You think the twitch has my genetic dna makeup?

1300
01:50:33,609 --> 01:50:35,609
What what do you mean?

1301
01:50:38,340 --> 01:50:40,579
You can request the destruction of dna

1302
01:50:41,220 --> 01:50:48,100
The path before you must be you must descend

1303
01:50:48,899 --> 01:50:51,270
Oh fuck

1304
01:50:51,270 --> 01:50:53,430
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, i'm fine

1305
01:51:02,949 --> 01:51:04,949
White fire makes the foes stronger

1306
01:51:19,859 --> 01:51:30,939
Munkah

1307
01:51:30,939 --> 01:51:33,420
Should I have my own munkah s emote?

1308
01:51:34,060 --> 01:51:51,909
Would you guys use it if it was called germa s?

1309
01:51:52,550 --> 01:52:02,489
There we go

1310
01:52:02,489 --> 01:52:16,760
All the way up. You already have one and nobody uses it. Yeah, because the emote doesn't look bright. It's like tiny

1311
01:52:17,159 --> 01:52:19,159
It looks strange

1312
01:52:19,640 --> 01:52:26,939
Plus there's a close-up of it already. That's another emote

1313
01:52:32,060 --> 01:52:34,380
That that fear emote and mars

1314
01:52:35,829 --> 01:52:37,829
They're more surprised than they are scared

1315
01:52:38,710 --> 01:52:45,180
That's a disaster

1316
01:52:45,180 --> 01:52:57,930
Wait, I have to press that button. What hold on? Oh god. Dammit

1317
01:52:59,289 --> 01:53:07,189
You die

1318
01:53:07,189 --> 01:53:08,630
the heck

1319
01:53:08,630 --> 01:53:10,869
All right. This is a fail safe good

1320
01:53:12,310 --> 01:53:19,779
I thought it was a

1321
01:53:20,380 --> 01:53:24,300
I thought it was a straight run. I didn't I think it's I didn't see that there was no ground

1322
01:53:29,689 --> 01:53:31,689
Okay, I was blending it

1323
01:53:35,850 --> 01:53:40,789
nice

1324
01:53:40,789 --> 01:53:42,789
Keep going. Keep going. Keep going. Keep going

1325
01:53:43,510 --> 01:53:46,390
Pretty good spill joke

1326
01:53:58,220 --> 01:53:59,420
Whoa

1327
01:53:59,500 --> 01:54:01,500
Oh painful

1328
01:54:01,979 --> 01:54:03,979
This is not a place. I really want to be fighting anybody

1329
01:54:05,260 --> 01:54:07,750
I need health. Give me please

1330
01:54:12,840 --> 01:54:15,800
I am in a lot of trouble if I don't get any health right now

1331
01:54:21,479 --> 01:54:24,420
shit

1332
01:54:24,420 --> 01:54:25,899
Thank you

1333
01:54:25,899 --> 01:54:27,739
the giant

1334
01:54:27,739 --> 01:54:31,399
the giant

1335
01:54:31,399 --> 01:54:33,159
protects the way

1336
01:54:33,159 --> 01:54:34,760
Get a mini boss

1337
01:54:34,760 --> 01:54:49,100
Something like that

1338
01:54:49,100 --> 01:54:56,020
Who's left the giant? Is there a giant?

1339
01:54:58,170 --> 01:55:13,979
Oh hi on the corner

1340
01:55:15,500 --> 01:55:17,659
Yeah, there's a giant there's a giant there's a giant

1341
01:55:20,619 --> 01:55:28,100
I wonder if I should use explosives

1342
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:32,119
Dammit

1343
01:55:32,119 --> 01:55:33,800
All right explosives

1344
01:55:33,800 --> 01:55:41,930
Did he just kill himself?

1345
01:55:41,930 --> 01:55:44,039
I think he just killed himself

1346
01:55:44,039 --> 01:55:46,840
He did a huge wind-up and just instantly died

1347
01:55:49,479 --> 01:55:52,439
I think he threw that into the wall and fucking killed him

1348
01:55:59,899 --> 01:56:03,500
Ah, how you guys doing tonight? What was the last time I checked in?

1349
01:56:04,460 --> 01:56:05,899
How's everybody?

1350
01:56:05,899 --> 01:56:11,579
You guys doing good? How you guys doing? For real you guys? How are things?

1351
01:56:12,220 --> 01:56:30,890

Glad to have you

Thanks for watching

1356
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:52,039
Oh boy

1357

1358
01:56:54,680 --> 01:57:02,199
This thing

1359
01:57:02,199 --> 01:57:10,310
The bubble gun is the best the path opens from below. I'm sure it does and this is a big scene here

1360
01:57:12,090 --> 01:57:13,050
Oh

1361
01:57:13,050 --> 01:57:18,229
We kind of go

1362
01:57:18,229 --> 01:57:30,979
That dead so that that one opens and I go to there

1363

1386
01:59:42,300 --> 01:59:45,100
A first-person shooter old school indie

1387
01:59:45,659 --> 01:59:49,020
Uh almost an rpg. It's not an rpg. It's it's about moving fast

1388
01:59:49,979 --> 01:59:52,939
And if you ever played the game dusk, it's by the same publisher as dusk

1389
01:59:54,060 --> 01:59:57,260
It's not halo reach. It's not halo reach. No, I was

1390
01:59:58,619 --> 02:00:01,020
Until the person I was playing with abandoned me

1391
02:00:03,420 --> 02:00:05,420
And now I now i'm sad

1392
02:00:07,130 --> 02:00:10,970
But yeah, this is a medieval we're like, uh, maybe halfway through the game maybe something like that

1393
02:00:17,020 --> 02:00:19,020
All right. Now, where do I go? Where do I go?

I activated the two buttons

1397
02:00:29,460 --> 02:00:31,720
I missed a button

1398
02:00:31,720 --> 02:00:34,970
Fuck I was walking in the circle. What do I do? How about over here?

1399
02:00:36,520 --> 02:00:40,680
Did I just go all the way to the back of the beginning? No, I didn't did I? Yes, I did. No, I didn't

1400
02:00:45,779 --> 02:00:48,340

All right. I'm paying attention trying to pay attention to the video game. I'll see you three two one go

02:01:30,600 --> 02:01:35,850
Got it. Joel turned your brain into mush

1418
02:02:16,170 --> 02:02:27,189
You should get a 5g emote already. What would it be?

1419
02:02:28,979 --> 02:02:31,539
All right. I have it on warrior mode. This is gonna be interesting

1420
02:02:40,779 --> 02:02:47,159

There's a cool

1437
02:04:26,220 --> 02:04:32,310
Sword somebody's behind me somebody's behind me. I like this level but it's um

1438
02:04:33,430 --> 02:04:35,430
It's the verticality that causes me issues

1439
02:04:36,470 --> 02:04:40,390
I know that I said that's why I like the level but you can like something and not like it at the same time

1440
02:04:41,510 --> 02:04:42,630
andros

1441
02:04:42,630 --> 02:04:53,619

02:05:03,659 --> 02:05:05,659
Dude, there's a new enemy type. Fuck

1446
02:05:09,960 --> 02:05:12,600
Why does germa always embarrass us in front of other streamers?

1447
02:05:22,840 --> 02:05:24,840
So i'm gonna i'm sure I should go down

1448
02:05:24,920 --> 02:05:30,020
Is it gonna hurt?

1449
02:05:30,020 --> 02:05:34,380
I gotta lodge out

1450
02:05:34,460 --> 02:05:36,140
Get out of the water

1451
02:05:36,140 --> 02:05:38,140
Yeah, why can I not get out of the water?

1452
02:05:38,859 --> 02:05:40,460
Get out of the water

1453
02:05:40,460 --> 02:05:42,460
Jump out of the water

1454
02:05:56,810 --> 02:05:58,489
Can I be cool?

1455
02:05:58,489 --> 02:06:00,550
for once

1456
02:06:00,550 --> 02:06:02,550
All right. What how do I do that?

1457
02:06:03,109 --> 02:06:07,750
All right. So you guys gotta give me some coaching here. So next time there's a raid that comes in

1458
02:06:08,229 --> 02:06:10,229
That's the first thing that I should say

1459
02:06:10,630 --> 02:06:14,170
What do you think?

1460
02:06:14,170 --> 02:06:17,850
Well, what do you think is like a good approach? What should I say turn the face cam on immediately?

1461
02:06:26,470 --> 02:06:28,939
Can you imagine?

1462
02:06:28,939 --> 02:06:32,619
If I didn't have a face cam on all of a sudden a raid came in a bunch of people came in like some of you

1463
02:06:32,619 --> 02:06:36,220
Guys that came over and I immediately just turned on the face cam. I'm like, hey, hey

1464
02:06:36,939 --> 02:06:39,420
I just pretended like it was on the whole time. That's just

1465
02:06:40,380 --> 02:06:50,789
Huh? Yeah, those for those of you that don't know this is a I don't do face cam on this stream

1466
02:06:51,750 --> 02:06:53,750
Unless it's my birthday

1467
02:06:53,909 --> 02:06:55,909
We do a face cam birthday stream every year

1468
02:06:57,029 --> 02:06:59,029
And that stream is 24 hours

1469
02:06:59,270 --> 02:07:02,760
I do a 24 hour birthday face cam stream

1470
02:07:03,720 --> 02:07:06,600
And I read letters that people send me

1471
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:13,300
I get a stack of them. I gotta get up there

1472
02:07:14,020 --> 02:07:20,300
You can't even stream for six

1473
02:07:20,539 --> 02:07:23,939
I like the I like that person to check take a look at the data

1474
02:07:24,899 --> 02:07:28,020
My average stream time is between the six and a half to seven and a half hours

1475
02:07:28,020 --> 02:07:30,579
I'd like them to check the data. You could just check on that data

1476
02:07:31,460 --> 02:07:41,020
Should I go back down?

1477
02:07:41,020 --> 02:07:52,699
Wait a minute

1478
02:07:52,779 --> 02:08:00,090
Ah, there's a button over here, right?

1479
02:08:00,090 --> 02:08:07,079
But what does this do for me? I went up this elevator already

1480
02:08:08,520 --> 02:08:11,560
The visage of fire not is not to be trifled with

1481
02:08:12,359 --> 02:08:22,340
What does that do for me? I don't know any idiots here that can help me

1482
02:08:34,470 --> 02:08:36,470
Did I what remind me did I pick up a key?

1483
02:08:37,109 --> 02:08:47,859
All right. Well, at least I got that

1484
02:08:47,859 --> 02:08:49,859
Is there a way I can check my keys?

1485
02:08:49,859 --> 02:08:54,550
Is it the silver key? Maybe I just don't remember

1486
02:08:56,489 --> 02:08:58,489
There are no idiots here. I know

1487
02:08:58,569 --> 02:09:02,329
Sucks sometimes man. I just wish there was like stupid people here besides me

1488
02:09:02,970 --> 02:09:05,350
It sucks

1489
02:09:05,350 --> 02:09:07,109
silver key

1490
02:09:07,109 --> 02:09:09,609
Go back in the hole

1491
02:09:09,609 --> 02:09:23,340
I could go this way

1492
02:09:23,340 --> 02:09:25,100
Show the slap clip

1493
02:09:25,100 --> 02:09:27,100
I'm surprised you guys weren't quicker on that one

1494
02:09:29,430 --> 02:09:31,430
That's usually the first thing that happens

1495
02:09:38,170 --> 02:09:40,329
Finally my favorite item. Yes

1496
02:09:46,060 --> 02:09:48,060
They spammed us like 30 times did they?

1497
02:09:48,460 --> 02:09:53,420
Oh shit, that's what I get for not paying attention anything fish in here

1498
02:09:57,670 --> 02:09:59,670
I haven't saved in a long time

1499
02:10:14,779 --> 02:10:17,109
No, don't touch that

1500
02:10:17,109 --> 02:10:18,550
All right. So this is

1501
02:10:18,550 --> 02:10:23,109
Probably get the person. Ah, there's the key right there. Damn it. All right. How do I open that?

1502
02:10:25,500 --> 02:10:27,340
Can I swim up maybe?

1503
02:10:27,340 --> 02:10:29,340
Well, i've just I got it. Whatever

1504
02:10:30,140 --> 02:10:35,829
There we go. But what about down here?

1505
02:10:35,829 --> 02:10:39,020
This is light coming from

1506
02:10:39,340 --> 02:10:43,369
It's a fish

1507
02:10:43,369 --> 02:10:48,500
No filter what?

1508
02:10:48,500 --> 02:10:50,500
You guys have to keep linking shit from my birthday

1509
02:10:50,979 --> 02:11:07,699
All right made it wait

1510
02:11:07,699 --> 02:11:09,699
I need the gold key. Ah

1511
02:11:10,020 --> 02:11:12,020
I need the gold key to get in here

1512
02:11:12,340 --> 02:11:14,340
I need that key. I gotta

1513
02:11:14,340 --> 02:11:16,340
There's probably an activator I can do over here

1514
02:11:17,430 --> 02:11:19,189
Scream if you see any buttons

1515
02:11:19,189 --> 02:11:25,449
the reflection of water

1516
02:11:25,449 --> 02:11:28,699
Only shows the surface

1517
02:11:28,699 --> 02:11:40,470
No shit glass will cut you

1518
02:11:42,260 --> 02:11:45,210
I know

1519
02:11:45,210 --> 02:11:47,689
Damn it. I don't see anything. Do you guys see anything?

1520
02:11:53,300 --> 02:11:55,300
Don't get smart on me. What are we talking about?

1521
02:11:56,100 --> 02:11:59,289
I don't see anything

1522
02:11:59,289 --> 02:12:01,689
I can't go back down. Where's the deep end?

1523
02:12:08,739 --> 02:12:10,260
Oh, there it is

1524
02:12:10,260 --> 02:12:14,899
Like I just got that. I got it. I got the key. I picked it up. I got it. I have it

1525
02:12:18,340 --> 02:12:20,220
All right

1526
02:12:20,220 --> 02:12:23,260
I I would not have found that we've been here for a long time

1527
02:12:24,300 --> 02:12:44,359
All right, open it

1528
02:12:44,359 --> 02:12:46,359
Are we still in his follower on the mode off?

1529
02:12:46,680 --> 02:12:56,390
If we put it back on we have to make a joke quick

1530
02:12:57,029 --> 02:13:01,590
What do I do?

1531
02:13:01,590 --> 02:13:06,329
What should I say?

1532
02:13:06,329 --> 02:13:10,250
Turn off slow turn. Okay turn off follower only turn off slow mode

1533
02:13:16,069 --> 02:13:18,630
Now you're asking too much. You're asking way too much

1534
02:13:31,210 --> 02:13:32,170
Wait

1535
02:13:32,170 --> 02:13:34,409
And wait, is it the anarchy is on again?

1536
02:13:35,529 --> 02:13:37,930
No, no, no slow mode. No follower mode

1537
02:13:38,729 --> 02:13:42,659
This is dangerous

1538
02:13:42,659 --> 02:13:44,659
Dangerous waters are crossing here

1539
02:13:46,250 --> 02:13:47,449
I'm gonna die

1540
02:13:47,449 --> 02:13:50,649
Oh, by the way, this is on hard

1541
02:13:50,649 --> 02:14:10,300
Those of you that are wondering give me more. All right, what's the what am I going to eat today? What do you think?

1542
02:14:11,939 --> 02:14:16,119
The first thing that somebody says in chat. I will eat it as long as it's actually edible

1543
02:14:17,000 --> 02:14:18,680
Anarchy can't eat that

1544
02:14:18,680 --> 02:14:23,350
So is it pizza? No, i'm not gonna do

1545
02:14:26,439 --> 02:14:28,439
Wings. Eh, no, i'm gonna do it

1546
02:14:30,699 --> 02:14:38,569
Need a ghost pepper. No

1547
02:14:38,569 --> 02:14:40,569
Big chicken. Hmm

1548
02:14:41,819 --> 02:14:45,899
No, no, no, no, nothing. No fast food today. Nothing. No fast food. I don't want that

1549
02:14:53,210 --> 02:14:54,979
sushi

1550
02:14:54,979 --> 02:14:56,340
now

1551
02:14:56,340 --> 02:14:58,819
No, no, no raw food. Not right now

1552
02:15:05,140 --> 02:15:07,770
low-made and general chicken

1553
02:15:07,850 --> 02:15:10,729
You're almost there. That's pretty that you're almost there. That's close

1554
02:15:24,220 --> 02:15:27,420
Pad Thai

1555
02:15:27,420 --> 02:15:29,659
I would say that that is probably accurate

1556
02:15:30,699 --> 02:15:32,939
Very accurate out. Yeah, that's accurate

1557
02:15:34,699 --> 02:15:45,239
nice work

1558
02:15:45,239 --> 02:15:46,840
Yeah, excellent job

1559
02:15:46,840 --> 02:15:50,810
That sounds fantastic

1560
02:15:50,810 --> 02:15:53,930
Oh, I can already I I can already see it on the plate steaming

1561
02:15:54,649 --> 02:15:56,250
It's so hot

1562
02:15:56,250 --> 02:16:01,989
If I when I just slurp up the noodles it just they whack me all in the fucking mouth and it's like fucking burning me

1563
02:16:02,149 --> 02:16:04,149
But it's where it's worth it

1564
02:16:06,069 --> 02:16:20,600
Uh, I can't go through there

1565
02:16:21,880 --> 02:16:27,640
I don't think there's anything else. I don't want to jump around on these things. It gotta be a button to press

1566
02:16:28,760 --> 02:16:30,119
down here

1567
02:16:30,119 --> 02:16:31,880
Didn't do this yet. Did I?

1568
02:16:31,880 --> 02:16:34,840
Well, I guess we're going up. No, we're not. What is this for?

1569
02:16:37,620 --> 02:16:47,739
Button is that for

1570
02:16:53,299 --> 02:16:56,500
Yeah, I want to show up on stream tomorrow with just these small

1571
02:16:57,379 --> 02:16:58,340
thin

1572
02:16:58,340 --> 02:16:59,219
red

1573
02:16:59,219 --> 02:17:01,219
Lines all around my mouth

1574
02:17:01,700 --> 02:17:06,420
And those are just like noodle burn marks from me just going too fast and eating it too when it's too hot

1575
02:17:17,319 --> 02:17:21,079
That way that way that way that way. No

1576
02:17:22,950 --> 02:17:24,950
Yeah, I'm just going in here. Fuck it

1577
02:17:26,170 --> 02:17:33,020
That moves

1578
02:17:33,260 --> 02:17:38,299
That's my birthday tomorrow. It's my birthday tomorrow. So we're gonna do a face scan tomorrow. Happy birthday

1579
02:17:39,020 --> 02:17:47,899
What's wrong with me? What's going on? Why am I getting hurt by it? Oh, it's fishes in here

1580
02:17:56,250 --> 02:18:03,989
Give me this

1581
02:18:03,989 --> 02:18:05,989
All right, three more to go apparently

1582
02:18:06,790 --> 02:18:09,030
So where those are, I don't know

1583
02:18:09,030 --> 02:18:10,629
And those one up there

1584
02:18:10,629 --> 02:18:12,629
We can just go like this

1585
02:18:14,170 --> 02:18:15,290
Two more

1586
02:18:15,290 --> 02:18:22,620
There it is one more. It's up there

1587
02:18:27,159 --> 02:18:29,159
Ah, you gotta get that one exact. Don't you?

1588
02:18:29,879 --> 02:18:40,389
Buy us a cake

1589
02:18:40,389 --> 02:18:49,270
No, I have to get this

1590
02:18:49,270 --> 02:18:51,270
Damn it. It's gonna be perfect

1591
02:18:54,579 --> 02:18:56,579
There it is. All right

1592
02:18:57,829 --> 02:19:00,629
So sequence complete that means what exactly?

1593
02:19:05,299 --> 02:19:09,139
We want ice cream instead

1594
02:19:09,139 --> 02:19:12,860
It's this turn

1595
02:19:12,860 --> 02:19:13,659
Oh

1596
02:19:13,659 --> 02:19:15,659
That's what that did cool

1597
02:19:17,420 --> 02:19:18,780
Turned on the fountain

1598
02:19:18,780 --> 02:19:23,899
That'd be a really expensive birthday

1599
02:19:24,219 --> 02:19:31,209
when their tv show about they've exactly what we're describing having like 5000 people go to a birthday party with a bunch of stuff and cake and

1600
02:19:31,290 --> 02:19:32,250
like

1601
02:19:32,250 --> 02:19:36,379
ponies to ride and

1602
02:19:36,379 --> 02:19:38,379
There was a thing about this. It was a tv show

1603
02:19:39,100 --> 02:19:49,989
It's called like my big birthday. What was it? It's on like mtv or something

1604
02:19:51,319 --> 02:19:56,280
And these people spent like seven or eight million dollars on their kid's birthday party

1605
02:19:57,239 --> 02:20:05,209
My it was my yeah my sweet 16, right?

1606
02:20:06,170 --> 02:20:09,739
That's what it was

1607
02:20:16,549 --> 02:20:20,389
Oh, I did it in the same fucking spot concentrate. Damn it

1608
02:20:24,250 --> 02:20:26,250
Yeah, that celebrities would come perform

1609
02:20:27,219 --> 02:20:30,020
At their birthday parties in a private concert

1610
02:20:32,010 --> 02:20:34,760
I'll tell you this right now

1611
02:20:34,760 --> 02:20:36,760
There's no I would never

1612
02:20:37,829 --> 02:20:43,110
I would never go. Okay, it's a somebody's house and do like a private germa stream

1613
02:20:46,170 --> 02:20:48,170
When that I think that would be sort of strange

1614
02:20:51,879 --> 02:20:57,719
Well, how would I how would that work? Why just get go in your house and set up a computer and just stream from your house?

1615
02:21:00,020 --> 02:21:03,059
You would what if you were paid? No, I don't think I could do that. That'd be fucking weird

1616
02:21:06,540 --> 02:21:09,989
But but where do you come in?

1617
02:21:09,989 --> 02:21:12,870
What's your what's your play on this? What is this?

1618
02:21:13,909 --> 02:21:15,510
Do you watch

1619
02:21:15,510 --> 02:21:17,510
the stream from a different room

1620
02:21:18,489 --> 02:21:22,409
You just have your ipad and you're just watching it from another room

1621
02:21:28,280 --> 02:21:36,250
How much money are you gonna give me for this what what how how much should I be charging for that?

1622
02:21:45,799 --> 02:21:53,049
$5,000 I'd rather you just buy a car for your

1623
02:21:54,489 --> 02:21:57,100
your

1624
02:21:57,100 --> 02:21:59,180
Just go buy a go buy a car

1625
02:22:06,250 --> 02:22:07,030
a

1626
02:22:07,030 --> 02:22:08,409
$5,000 car

1627
02:22:08,409 --> 02:22:12,120
Hey, you can probably get like an old honda civic

1628
02:22:12,760 --> 02:22:18,659
Those things gonna have like two or three hundred thousand miles on them and still run like they just came out of the factory

1629
02:22:21,799 --> 02:22:27,049
I would know

1630
02:22:27,049 --> 02:22:29,049
All right, then here's how I would do that

1631
02:22:30,579 --> 02:22:32,579
I would do that for a

1632
02:22:32,719 --> 02:22:34,719
$5,000 mcdonald's gift card

1633
02:22:35,420 --> 02:22:40,219
And those of you that are asking I can't that's impossible. You have to call and special custom order that

1634
02:22:41,739 --> 02:22:44,540
And if they if they won't do it for you, you have to find a way

1635
02:22:46,729 --> 02:22:50,969
You have to call corporate and somehow put $5,000 on a mcdonald's gift card

1636
02:23:08,309 --> 02:23:11,510
My civic has 208 000 miles on it or something, right?

1637
02:23:12,780 --> 02:23:14,700
You you get it

1638
02:23:14,700 --> 02:23:22,870
You get it

1639
02:23:22,870 --> 02:23:24,870
Did I fall off in the worst possible spot?

1640
02:23:25,430 --> 02:23:39,319
I did didn't I?

1641
02:23:39,319 --> 02:23:42,870
What's that?

1642
02:23:42,870 --> 02:23:44,870
Omega lull ruined

1643
02:23:45,979 --> 02:23:48,299
The streamer owns a civic laugh out loud

1644
02:23:49,260 --> 02:23:51,260
Uh, yeah, that's not what you said. I'm paraphrasing

1645
02:24:02,469 --> 02:24:04,309
Oh super

1646
02:24:04,309 --> 02:24:06,409
but

1647
02:24:06,409 --> 02:24:08,729
All right, save it here 29 health. This is bad

1648
02:24:15,219 --> 02:24:25,020
Ask and you shall receive can this streamer drive a stick? No

1649
02:24:26,540 --> 02:24:28,809
and

1650
02:24:28,809 --> 02:24:32,680
Why would I want to?

1651
02:24:32,680 --> 02:24:35,739
Let me let me demonstrate the life of a stick driver

1652
02:24:54,420 --> 02:24:56,420
Imagine doing that for like two hours straight

1653
02:24:58,579 --> 02:25:01,059
Imagine you had imagine you was stuck in traffic for like three hours

1654
02:25:10,729 --> 02:25:13,049
Everybody i've ever been in a car with a drove a stick

1655
02:25:15,100 --> 02:25:18,299
It's just like it was a full-time job to drive that car

1656
02:25:19,100 --> 02:25:25,190
Guys I have problems turning on the wipers in my car. You think i'd be able to drive a manual

1657
02:25:28,920 --> 02:25:31,639
I've driven the same car for a long time and I still

1658
02:25:32,600 --> 02:25:36,680
Still when it rains which uh, what what setting does the one how do I go halfway?

1659
02:25:36,680 --> 02:25:40,360
So it only goes the blades go up and down every like half second. I don't I don't know

1660
02:25:41,159 --> 02:25:43,159
I'm just gonna guess until I get the way that I want it

1661
02:25:45,420 --> 02:25:46,940
You think I can handle a manual?

1662
02:25:46,940 --> 02:26:05,879
Oh, he just directs him with that god damn it

1663
02:26:05,879 --> 02:26:07,879
That sucks

1664
02:26:10,379 --> 02:26:15,639
I headshot him. That's the only man saving

1665
02:26:16,760 --> 02:26:31,180
You wonder what am I actually what hey, I have actually a pet peeve for automobiles. Would you like to hear it?

1666
02:26:32,299 --> 02:26:35,579
You guys want to hear it? Yeah. Okay, i'll tell you

1667
02:26:36,840 --> 02:26:38,120
so

1668
02:26:38,120 --> 02:26:40,040
when somebody has

1669
02:26:40,040 --> 02:26:41,799
a horn

1670
02:26:41,799 --> 02:26:44,120
That is not a regular horn

1671
02:26:46,379 --> 02:26:48,379
everybody knows what a car horn sounds like

1672
02:26:48,940 --> 02:26:52,840
when you have a car horn that just goes like

1673
02:26:54,520 --> 02:26:56,520
Universal everybody knows what that sound is

1674
02:26:57,000 --> 02:26:59,299
When somebody has a custom car horn

1675
02:27:00,600 --> 02:27:05,719
You i've heard it. I feel like my car exploded when I hear somebody use a custom car horn

1676
02:27:06,280 --> 02:27:07,879
If they're near me

1677
02:27:07,879 --> 02:27:11,959
And it's like uh, it's just like something's i'm gonna get hurt

1678
02:27:13,590 --> 02:27:15,590
or like

1679
02:27:20,440 --> 02:27:22,870
It's like

1680
02:27:22,870 --> 02:27:26,629
I it freaks me the fuck out man. It scares the shit out of me

1681
02:27:33,639 --> 02:27:45,350
And nobody's prepared for it this one time I pulled up to a red light

1682
02:27:46,299 --> 02:27:50,780
And i'm not even kidding

1683
02:27:50,780 --> 02:27:56,549
The guy held his horn down and it was the peewee herman lab. I don't even know how the fuck you did that

1684
02:28:07,350 --> 02:28:09,350
fake fake

1685
02:28:09,510 --> 02:28:14,149
fake

1686
02:28:14,149 --> 02:28:16,149
He left this place, but what?

1687
02:28:16,309 --> 02:28:22,389
Holy shit, that is insane

1688
02:28:24,059 --> 02:28:28,540
Well, that wasn't the actual peewee herman lab. No, okay, you got me but it sounded like it it was like

1689
02:28:30,069 --> 02:28:32,920
I can't even do it

1690
02:28:33,000 --> 02:28:35,000
It was like

1691
02:28:36,309 --> 02:28:38,780
It was crazy

1692
02:28:38,780 --> 02:28:43,159
it's like

1693
02:28:43,159 --> 02:28:45,479
And then they they beat it really quickly. So it was like

1694
02:28:48,680 --> 02:28:51,590
I was like that's peewee herman

1695
02:28:51,590 --> 02:29:00,549
Literally right next to me

1696
02:29:00,549 --> 02:29:09,670
Can I get some goddamn help? What if it was just peewee out the window? I don't know

1697
02:29:13,399 --> 02:29:15,399
Somebody's doing drive-by peewee hermans

1698
02:29:19,450 --> 02:29:21,450
No, it was definitely their horn

1699
02:29:21,690 --> 02:29:23,930
And they may have had a regular horn that just sounded like shit

1700
02:29:26,010 --> 02:29:28,180
Or I may have dreamed this

1701
02:29:28,180 --> 02:29:31,350
I don't know

1702
02:29:31,350 --> 02:29:38,649
I got fucking dead

1703
02:29:38,889 --> 02:29:52,100
Shit, I didn't know you were here. No, I walked into it again

1704
02:30:01,260 --> 02:30:03,260
Softlock? No, just don't get hit

1705
02:30:11,780 --> 02:30:20,889
See now here's a follow-up question to those of you that have any idea

1706
02:30:21,690 --> 02:30:25,530
Are there any laws or regulations on what you can and cannot have?

1707
02:30:27,399 --> 02:30:30,920
For a custom car horn if you spent the money to have one

1708
02:30:32,219 --> 02:30:34,389
Could you have

1709
02:30:34,469 --> 02:30:36,469
Like for instance like a like homer simpson

1710
02:30:37,909 --> 02:30:39,909
Like a doe could you have that?

1711
02:30:41,079 --> 02:30:42,360
Actually, yes

1712
02:30:42,360 --> 02:30:46,120
So on in what legislation did they have to write down?

1713
02:30:47,399 --> 02:30:49,479
A wuga is okay and like

1714
02:30:50,760 --> 02:30:53,379
Is okay

1715
02:30:53,379 --> 02:30:58,020
That's how that's written down somewhere like submarine going down

1716
02:31:01,209 --> 02:31:04,809
That somebody had to write that right? So what's another what are other ones that are illegally allowed to have?

1717
02:31:08,739 --> 02:31:13,020
the awuga clause

1718
02:31:13,020 --> 02:31:14,780
a police siren

1719
02:31:14,780 --> 02:31:18,540
Uh, that's not

1720
02:31:18,540 --> 02:31:24,090
Why what if it's my custom car horn? I just want everyone around me to think there's some fucking emergency

1721
02:31:27,590 --> 02:31:40,059
You can't have a train horn. What did I open that came down something came down that I wonder

1722
02:31:40,059 --> 02:31:42,059
What is a lot? I need to look this up after the stream

1723
02:31:42,899 --> 02:31:46,579
What custom car horns are allowed and are there only two of them?

1724
02:31:49,799 --> 02:31:52,920
Okay, wait every motor vehicle when operated by a highway

1725
02:31:53,799 --> 02:31:55,799
Must be equipped with that. I didn't see it

1726
02:31:59,590 --> 02:32:03,100
Look up right now

1727
02:32:03,100 --> 02:32:06,540
Oh, you you actually mean look it up right now not look upright

1728
02:32:07,340 --> 02:32:09,340
okay, um

1729
02:32:10,780 --> 02:32:14,860
What is legal for a custom car horn?

1730
02:32:17,739 --> 02:32:22,940
Existing law require a motor vehicle when operated upon a highway to be equipped with a horn in good working order and capable of emitting

1731
02:32:23,020 --> 02:32:31,020
Sound audible under normal conditions from a distance of no less than 200 feet but prohibits a horn from emitting an unreasonably loud or harsh sound

1732
02:32:33,700 --> 02:32:36,100
This does this does not say anything about homer simpson

1733
02:32:39,299 --> 02:32:41,299
Laws on car horns. Hold on

1734
02:32:41,620 --> 02:32:47,829
Okay, so the law today

1735
02:32:51,739 --> 02:32:56,860
Yeah, yeah, it is it is it is illegal to use a car horn for any purpose other than to express warning

1736
02:32:57,819 --> 02:32:59,819
In the state of washington for instance

1737
02:32:59,819 --> 02:33:05,180
The law reads the driver of a motor vehicle shall when reasonably necessary to ensure safe operation give audible warning with his horn

1738
02:33:05,500 --> 02:33:08,139
But shall not otherwise use such a horn when upon a highway

1739
02:33:08,620 --> 02:33:12,780
Well, this is this is bullshit because drive by literally any local politician

1740
02:33:13,420 --> 02:33:14,459
uh

1741
02:33:14,459 --> 02:33:16,459
Group of people holding signs

1742
02:33:17,420 --> 02:33:19,260
Yeah

1743
02:33:19,260 --> 02:33:26,379
Hey, yeah, I agree with you. That's not real. It has to be on there somewhere

1744
02:33:29,190 --> 02:33:35,879
Penalties

1745
02:33:35,879 --> 02:33:38,200
Do you know anyone who has ever been busted for honking?

1746
02:33:38,280 --> 02:33:44,040
Probably not can you get arrested for like using your horn when you're not supposed to this doesn't say where's the homer simpson line though?

1747
02:33:44,520 --> 02:33:46,360
custom car horns

1748
02:33:46,360 --> 02:33:54,659
Can you replace a car horn? No, this is how to fix a broken car. Is this even on the books?

1749
02:33:55,219 --> 02:34:04,120
I don't know about arrested. This is important though

1750
02:34:07,750 --> 02:34:10,229
Are train horns illegal in my state?

1751
02:34:13,780 --> 02:34:18,579
There isn't one as long as it isn't extremely loud and it yeah as long as it's used to alert others

1752
02:34:29,350 --> 02:34:32,950
If you're impersonating emergency vehicles or breaking sound laws, then yeah

1753
02:34:33,590 --> 02:34:36,709
Okay, but what if I had a perfectly legal sound?

1754
02:34:37,510 --> 02:34:39,510
audible level of

1755
02:34:40,860 --> 02:34:42,299
Let's say

1756
02:34:42,299 --> 02:34:43,979
gordon ramsay

1757
02:34:43,979 --> 02:34:45,979
Saying like fuck off

1758
02:34:48,409 --> 02:34:51,979
Is that could is that does that like is that a loophole?

1759
02:34:57,239 --> 02:35:00,920
You could argue it but a cop might stop you

1760
02:35:04,889 --> 02:35:08,569
All right. Where do we go this way this way this way up? I can't go through what?

1761
02:35:09,450 --> 02:35:17,319
All right. I gotta pay attention. No more car horns. What if it was what if you did what if you did the dark souls?

1762
02:35:17,319 --> 02:35:19,319
Hey, hey

1763
02:35:32,280 --> 02:35:33,959
And by the way

1764
02:35:33,959 --> 02:35:35,159
why

1765
02:35:35,159 --> 02:35:39,670
This is important. This is important discussion. Why is there only a horn to say?

1766
02:35:40,629 --> 02:35:44,389
Fuck look out and why is there not like a you go ahead or a

1767
02:35:45,030 --> 02:35:50,870
Hi or a be careful. Why how come there's only one horn why this shouldn't be like two or three different horns

1768
02:35:57,909 --> 02:36:00,149
like a gentler one that's instead of being like

1769
02:36:00,870 --> 02:36:01,909
it's like

1770
02:36:01,909 --> 02:36:07,989
What what and that means something that's not like a hard horn like hey, you can go ahead you go first or

1771
02:36:10,649 --> 02:36:13,290
your

1772
02:36:13,290 --> 02:36:17,049
Your brights are on yeah, just something that's softer and nicer

1773
02:36:18,549 --> 02:36:21,909
Where the fuck am I going? Um, all right, I think down here

1774
02:36:22,790 --> 02:36:26,180
There's a fish in there

1775
02:36:26,659 --> 02:36:30,180
Flash flash your lights, but you could distract somebody that way

1776
02:36:31,139 --> 02:36:33,139
if it was very clear that like the

1777
02:36:34,739 --> 02:36:38,500
Was something very light and like oh, hey, you gotta turn your lights on or

1778
02:36:42,809 --> 02:36:53,899
Where should I go?

1779
02:36:53,899 --> 02:37:04,280
Go to bed scream out your window

1780
02:37:06,149 --> 02:37:08,389
No enough people do that already

1781
02:37:09,350 --> 02:37:18,649
I'm turned around here. I gotta go the right way. All right, found it. Okay, I found it

1782
02:37:19,610 --> 02:37:31,399
He's like people yelling at each other screaming out the window and shit, but that didn't solve anything

1783
02:37:32,360 --> 02:37:36,700
But you never you're never gonna see the person ever again. You'll never see that person again

1784
02:37:40,729 --> 02:37:43,129
Like you know, you're a fucking idiot. You know that

1785
02:37:43,850 --> 02:37:49,049
Okay, i'll never see you. I will never see you again. Like I don't that that carries no weight on me

1786
02:37:50,010 --> 02:37:59,239
See for say see you in court

1787
02:38:02,950 --> 02:38:16,579
Those doors are gonna open

1788
02:38:21,110 --> 02:38:22,709
People behind the wheel

1789
02:38:22,709 --> 02:38:27,190
Something happens people go people go fucking nuts when they're like operating a car

1790
02:38:27,909 --> 02:38:29,909
We already talked about like the speed thing

1791
02:38:32,139 --> 02:38:34,940
But let's refresh for those of you that weren't here for the class

1792
02:38:37,059 --> 02:38:40,180
When people go like 20 miles per hour over the speed limit

1793
02:38:41,219 --> 02:38:43,219
And they get to the same red light as you

1794
02:38:44,260 --> 02:38:47,620
it's just like don't I wish there was a horn for like

1795
02:38:48,420 --> 02:38:50,180
Like told yourself

1796
02:38:50,180 --> 02:38:52,260
Like oh look look how far that got you

1797
02:38:52,739 --> 02:38:55,139
Why can't there be a horn that that everybody knows is

1798
02:38:56,180 --> 02:38:58,760
Look how far that got you. I would love it

1799
02:38:59,479 --> 02:39:04,409
I would use it fucking all the time

1800
02:39:04,649 --> 02:39:15,979
Oh, I had to like change lanes like

1801
02:39:17,180 --> 02:39:19,180
Rip around you know

1802
02:39:21,260 --> 02:39:23,020
Oh is that your car

1803
02:39:23,020 --> 02:39:27,739
It in the at the same red light as me and i'm driving normally

1804
02:39:29,209 --> 02:39:32,809
I imagine that person just sitting behind the wheel just gripping the wheel going like fuck

1805
02:39:33,770 --> 02:39:35,770
Fuck

1806
02:39:40,100 --> 02:39:42,100
I feel like those people don't want red lights

1807
02:39:42,579 --> 02:39:44,579
Why can't I just drive through this?

1808
02:39:45,500 --> 02:39:47,500
I just want to just let me go. I don't care

1809
02:39:49,979 --> 02:39:51,340
and then like

1810
02:39:51,340 --> 02:39:55,739
They just blow a fucking snot rocket like in the bottom of their own car. That's what I pictured

1811
02:39:57,459 --> 02:39:58,739
And they try to get out the window

1812
02:39:58,739 --> 02:39:59,540
They rolled the window down

1813
02:39:59,540 --> 02:40:03,540
They're trying to blow a fucking snot rocket out the window and they miss and they hit they hit the same spot

1814
02:40:03,940 --> 02:40:06,260
Where the handle is for the door that they've hit

1815
02:40:07,139 --> 02:40:11,059
50 times already and this just stains there from them trying to do that

1816
02:40:11,620 --> 02:40:37,000
Go fast. Oh, there it is. Oh, I gotta go fast. All right, hold that thought you have the rovers living in your head rent free

1817
02:40:38,040 --> 02:40:44,329
I don't know. It's i'm telling you something happens to people when they like get wild on the fucking wheel

1818
02:40:47,180 --> 02:40:49,899
And I feel like that same person if you were to bring this up to them

1819
02:40:50,299 --> 02:40:54,299
In a conversation about like and you and you don't know that they're like one of these like crazy drivers

1820
02:40:54,700 --> 02:40:56,700
They would say the same shit

1821
02:40:56,860 --> 02:41:02,940
They'd be like, yeah. Yeah, I really hate that. I really don't like people speed value and scream out the window and blow snot rockets

1822
02:41:03,260 --> 02:41:06,459
It's just it's just not okay. It's not okay

1823
02:41:07,579 --> 02:41:09,579
You're you it's you

1824
02:41:20,889 --> 02:41:25,690
Well, it must then it must be you because you're talking about it i'm the one doing it

1825
02:41:30,920 --> 02:41:35,559
Hey dude, i'm high as fuck. All right

1826
02:41:37,190 --> 02:41:55,399
Good to see you

1827
02:41:55,399 --> 02:41:57,399
Oh, right. I don't have my weapons

1828
02:41:58,100 --> 02:41:59,860
Saved did I save it yet?

1829
02:41:59,860 --> 02:42:11,059
Living in your head rent free

1830
02:42:14,760 --> 02:42:16,340
Yeah

1831
02:42:16,340 --> 02:42:20,020
Because what it happens you're like what the fuck is wrong with this person?

1832
02:42:25,510 --> 02:42:28,870
Dude, I have seen so many people drive around

1833
02:42:30,379 --> 02:42:34,299
Remember remember the two places that I have been living in in my life

1834
02:42:36,059 --> 02:42:37,590
boston

1835
02:42:37,590 --> 02:42:39,829
Like east coast and then las vegas

1836
02:42:41,270 --> 02:42:47,590
I've seen so many people on the highway just fucking ripping around lanes driving like a psycho

1837
02:42:49,350 --> 02:42:52,090
screaming at each other

1838
02:42:52,090 --> 02:42:53,850
Cutting each other off

1839
02:42:53,850 --> 02:42:56,069
playing cut off tag

1840
02:42:56,069 --> 02:43:02,920
With each other. It's like what the fuck are you people doing?

1841
02:43:03,559 --> 02:43:22,379
Have I you've never had road rage before

1842
02:43:22,860 --> 02:43:27,020
Oh, i've been i've had like my share of i'm upset at something going on and on the road

1843
02:43:27,819 --> 02:43:30,940
But never like i'm upset at something going on in the road

1844
02:43:31,020 --> 02:43:36,860
So now let me accelerate to at 30 miles per hour over the speed limit and overtake three people

1845
02:43:37,180 --> 02:43:59,940
While I blow snot rockets on my windshield. He's obsessed with this

1846
02:44:01,780 --> 02:44:05,690
This one I just want goddamn safe driving I just want safe drivers

1847
02:44:16,170 --> 02:44:18,889
It's even worse when you pull up behind those people

1848
02:44:19,370 --> 02:44:24,569
And they've got those stickers on the back of their car that show I how many children are in the family

1849
02:44:27,510 --> 02:44:33,030
Oh, yeah, there's me there's dad and there's there's one two three four children. Oh

1850
02:44:34,149 --> 02:44:38,409
Are you in the car now?

1851
02:44:38,409 --> 02:44:54,180
What do you okay? How many children are in? Okay, I gotta start shooting things

1852
02:44:55,059 --> 02:45:11,959
Oh, this is tricky

1853
02:45:15,540 --> 02:45:17,219
I need silver key

1854
02:45:17,219 --> 02:45:25,129
Remember that these guys are hard to melee

1855
02:45:34,420 --> 02:45:36,420
Silver silver remember silver silver

1856
02:45:42,389 --> 02:45:47,319
Anything I missed down here?

1857
02:45:47,319 --> 02:45:49,319
What stock superpower is the best?

1858
02:45:52,600 --> 02:45:54,709
uh

1859
02:45:54,709 --> 02:45:58,790
well, there's there's a lot of loaded question because

1860
02:46:00,069 --> 02:46:04,309
Is this superpower that you have that you're the only person that has this superpower?

1861
02:46:04,870 --> 02:46:07,430
And if you choose flying all of a sudden you become

1862
02:46:08,229 --> 02:46:12,950
Like public enemy number one. There's a person flying and we have to do something about that person

1863
02:46:13,670 --> 02:46:15,829
Or is it like we live in a superhero society?

1864
02:46:23,530 --> 02:46:25,530
Just like we're in a superhero

1865
02:46:29,209 --> 02:46:32,780
world

1866
02:46:32,780 --> 02:46:34,780
uh the best stock power

1867
02:46:37,129 --> 02:46:39,129
No, it's not. It's not invisibility. It's not

1868
02:46:40,649 --> 02:46:42,889
Guys, you could if you're invisible you still die

1869
02:46:45,780 --> 02:46:48,180
Like if you're invisible, you can still step on a landmine

1870
02:46:49,540 --> 02:46:51,620
So no, you still die. I would say

1871
02:46:52,579 --> 02:46:56,409
I'm dead. Yeah

1872
02:46:56,409 --> 02:46:58,409
Like hypo just said time control

1873
02:46:59,420 --> 02:47:01,500
And nothing too extreme. I just mean like

1874
02:47:02,379 --> 02:47:04,379
being able to rewind

1875
02:47:05,530 --> 02:47:07,420
maybe like

1876
02:47:07,420 --> 02:47:09,420
Maybe like like 10 minutes

1877
02:47:10,549 --> 02:47:18,280
Right 10 minutes you just can you you can make the universe go back 10 minutes whenever you want

1878
02:47:20,809 --> 02:47:26,489
Nothing bad happens. It's just you have control over this device that makes it so the whole world rewinds 10 minutes and nobody knows

1879
02:47:29,909 --> 02:47:34,629
You know how many times i've like left my wallet somewhere or like oh fuck my keys are in just rewind and just grab them

1880
02:47:35,430 --> 02:47:45,319
Or like if you ate something that you didn't want to eat and you didn't like it if you went to the menu

1881
02:47:45,959 --> 02:47:47,399
And you said okay. Here's um, uh

1882
02:47:47,399 --> 02:47:50,520
I want the steak, please and you order you get the steak and you eat it and you don't like it

1883
02:47:50,520 --> 02:47:52,520
Just rewind and order something else

1884
02:47:52,520 --> 02:47:56,200
You seriously wouldn't want that power to go to a restaurant and be able to eat and then rewind to pick something else

1885
02:48:01,500 --> 02:48:05,819
Okay, adam sandler, by the way adam sandler is up for an academy award probably

1886
02:48:06,459 --> 02:48:11,340
So all of you adam sandler haters out there just know that that dude is

1887
02:48:11,899 --> 02:48:15,579
Is going to potentially win the best actor of the year award

1888
02:48:17,510 --> 02:48:21,180
Go look it up

1889
02:48:21,180 --> 02:48:23,180
You think we're in the darkest timeline?

1890
02:48:24,180 --> 02:48:27,139
You a lot of you guys talk a lot of shit about mr sandler

1891
02:48:28,569 --> 02:48:32,090
And now he's up for fucking one of the most coveted acting awards potentially

1892
02:48:32,889 --> 02:48:35,659
that exists

1893
02:48:35,659 --> 02:48:47,340
Okay, i've got i gotta kill these fucking things. I need ammo on a weapon

1894
02:48:47,899 --> 02:48:52,709
There's no weapon ammo line around here. These guys can just aim and shoot

1895
02:48:54,299 --> 02:48:56,180
He's not gonna win

1896
02:48:56,180 --> 02:48:57,459
You know what?

1897
02:48:57,459 --> 02:49:00,020
I kind of hope he does

1898
02:49:00,020 --> 02:49:01,459
I kind of hope he does

1899
02:49:01,459 --> 02:49:03,780
In in some weird way. I hope he does

1900
02:49:09,459 --> 02:49:11,459
I hope adam sandler wins best actor

1901
02:49:12,180 --> 02:49:20,409
You know those like events that people say is the event that happened

1902
02:49:21,049 --> 02:49:24,010
That really crossed us over and that was the turning point

1903
02:49:25,610 --> 02:49:30,569
Adam sandler winning best actor at the academy awards might be that event and I can't fucking do this

1904
02:49:38,569 --> 02:49:40,090
Turn around

1905
02:49:40,090 --> 02:49:51,079
What turn around?

1906
02:49:51,079 --> 02:49:53,159
That's that's the start of the world ending events

1907
02:49:53,959 --> 02:49:57,000
No, i'm just gonna go buy them

1908
02:49:57,000 --> 02:50:02,700
It was open

1909
02:50:02,700 --> 02:50:10,500
God give me a break

1910
02:50:10,500 --> 02:50:11,379
um

1911
02:50:11,379 --> 02:50:15,850
Shit sure, but joel is behind you

1912
02:50:16,489 --> 02:50:25,100
Is it wait what happened over here? This is this the turn around thing?

1913
02:50:25,899 --> 02:50:28,389
Turn around turn around

1914
02:50:28,389 --> 02:50:29,590
Oh

1915
02:50:29,590 --> 02:50:33,209

1916
02:50:33,209 --> 02:50:39,319

1917
02:50:39,319 --> 02:50:41,000
He's still here

1918

Wait, is joel bit? I talked a lot of shit about joel. Is he still here?

1919
02:50:53,989 --> 02:50:55,989
Yes, he's still in the bathroom

1920
02:50:58,100 --> 02:51:02,180
No, he definitely left the stream on and fell asleep. It's like six o'clock in the morning over there

1921
02:51:02,979 --> 02:51:13,079
Should I try to wake him up? All right, i'm gonna wake him up. I'm gonna wake him up

1922
02:51:22,579 --> 02:51:28,780

Tell the truth freely. Would you guys be upset with me?

1940
02:53:39,030 --> 02:53:48,469
If some random billionaire paid me a million dollars to stream fortnite 10 times in a row

1941
02:53:49,590 --> 02:53:51,670
Would you guys be angry if I did that?

1942
02:53:52,469 --> 02:54:06,200
Would you be upset with me?

1943
02:54:06,200 --> 02:54:08,200
All right, any millionaires here?

You ever think how many okay, how many people here do you think are millionaires?

02:54:24,100 --> 02:54:27,540
Do you think if there's like let's say there's 36 700 people here

1946
02:54:28,770 --> 02:54:33,510
Statistically speaking how many people here are a mill have a million dollars in their bank account right now. What do you think?

Damn, that was tricky

1986
02:58:15,750 --> 02:58:19,899
Now you're gonna press all these buttons, huh?

1987
02:58:20,059 --> 02:58:22,059
Oh is fishing here

1988
02:58:26,940 --> 02:58:28,860
You can rocket jump

1989
02:58:28,860 --> 02:58:32,629
Yeah, but I i'm terrible. It's not I can't do it

1990
02:58:33,270 --> 02:58:37,579
I'm, not sure if you were here like a half an hour ago

1991
02:58:37,579 --> 02:58:40,700
So maybe 45 minutes ago, but I was trying over and over again to get this to work

1992
02:58:41,420 --> 02:58:47,579
I couldn't get it to work. So I I was getting so fucking just actually not even like joke angry. I was just getting like

1993
02:58:48,540 --> 02:58:53,110
I just like not I wasn't feeling it and I was gonna turn the stream off and shit. So I just figured

1994
02:58:53,829 --> 02:58:55,829
Just don't don't even get that far, you know

1995
02:58:57,030 --> 02:59:11,049
I just feel myself getting actually just truly annoyed and it was just like

1996
02:59:12,250 --> 02:59:14,250
This is not fucking the way that I want to be

1997
02:59:15,049 --> 02:59:17,530
So I just I just gave up on it and I said I wasn't gonna try it anymore

1998
02:59:27,420 --> 02:59:30,620
And I know that I know that I lost a few people today with just how fucking

1999
02:59:31,180 --> 02:59:33,899
Seriously, just how annoying and angry I was and I I know

2000
02:59:35,100 --> 02:59:37,530
Two or three messages came in about like dude

2001
02:59:38,649 --> 02:59:41,370
Like that's just just you need to shut the fuck up and chill out

2002
02:59:41,370 --> 02:59:43,850
And i'm just like I told him to shut up and shit and it just got ugly

2003
02:59:48,489 --> 02:59:52,969
Now like after like 40 like an hour later, so it's just like I shouldn't I shouldn't do that

2004
03:00:11,290 --> 03:00:16,569
Web of lies. No one knows what's actually real. No one knows what's actually real

2005
03:00:18,040 --> 03:00:20,280
They don't know which way we're going

2006
03:00:21,819 --> 03:00:24,860
All the while the water's flowing

2007
03:00:26,629 --> 03:00:29,670
Is it raining? Is it pouring?

2008
03:00:33,879 --> 03:00:36,360
And it's certainly not showing

2009
03:00:37,559 --> 03:00:39,559
any charge that

2010
03:00:40,680 --> 03:00:42,760
What if I just fucking started screaming that

2011
03:00:43,879 --> 03:00:56,069
You gotta get him with a tube get him right in the hands

2012
03:00:57,030 --> 03:01:02,090
What's with the explosion?

2013
03:01:02,090 --> 03:01:04,649
Get the fuck out of here

03:01:06,010 --> 03:01:08,010

Yeah, oh, okay

2025
03:02:24,069 --> 03:02:25,909

03:02:25,909 --> 03:02:37,620
Good night, germa. Good night

2038
03:04:12,760 --> 03:04:15,260
I haven't been streaming that long

2039
03:04:15,260 --> 03:04:17,370
started later

2040
03:04:17,370 --> 03:04:19,450
But i've only been streaming for five hours or so

2041
03:04:20,409 --> 03:04:28,860

2044
03:04:47,399 --> 03:04:53,000
How's my chest doing tonight, um, i'm all right i'm fine

2045
03:04:53,959 --> 03:04:58,200
i'm okay

2046
03:04:58,200 --> 03:05:00,920
I know the way that I just said that made it seem like no I did not

2047
03:05:01,639 --> 03:05:13,430
No, what i'm starting to do is i'm starting to do some uh

2048
03:05:14,229 --> 03:05:17,129
some stretches

2049
03:05:17,129 --> 03:05:19,610
So i'm specific to rib and back

2050
03:05:20,469 --> 03:05:22,469
costochondritis

2051
03:05:23,379 --> 03:05:25,379
Stretches and I got this little device

2052
03:05:26,260 --> 03:05:30,500
that helps you put it under your back and it helps uh stretch out your muscles and

2053
03:05:31,219 --> 03:05:33,620
You lie on it for a little while. I'm gonna try it and see if it helps

2054
03:05:34,500 --> 03:05:36,500
Also, well at the same time

2055
03:05:36,579 --> 03:05:40,020
Uh, i've got like other appointments to go to and everything but

2056
03:05:41,139 --> 03:05:43,139
It is not quite a foam roller

2057
03:05:43,299 --> 03:05:45,299
It's almost like a little wedge

2058
03:05:45,379 --> 03:05:47,940
That you have to kind of lie on to help stretch your back

2059
03:05:52,819 --> 03:05:54,819
All right, somebody just wrote something so

2060
03:05:55,700 --> 03:05:57,850
fucking crazy

2061
03:05:57,850 --> 03:06:10,389
I can't even

2062
03:06:10,389 --> 03:06:12,389
All right, here comes

2063
03:06:12,389 --> 03:06:18,700
A I don't know boss fight maybe no possible. Where are you all the way over here?

2064
03:06:23,159 --> 03:06:28,379
Testicles in stomach

2065
03:06:28,379 --> 03:06:32,239
Yeah, I have to have this I have this uh condition guide guys called costochondritis

2066
03:06:33,100 --> 03:06:36,459
Is when your testicle sucks up into your stomach?

2067
03:06:38,520 --> 03:06:40,950
Yes, that's what it is

2068
03:06:40,950 --> 03:06:43,989
You don't even have to google it to know that it's not true, but you don't have to have to do that

2069
03:06:43,989 --> 03:06:45,989
I googled it for you

2070
03:06:47,459 --> 03:06:55,030
That was the thing people were saying, uh the other night the pilgrims what?

2071
03:06:59,989 --> 03:07:01,989
Stop i'm trying to read

2072
03:07:06,870 --> 03:07:09,989
Get out of here. Oh my god, go back to tekken

2073
03:07:10,950 --> 03:07:17,450
What's that character's name bill?

2074
03:07:17,450 --> 03:07:29,379
The pilgrim path. No, it's like seven pages long. I can't I don't want to do it

2075
03:07:41,799 --> 03:07:50,440
Billy tekken

2076
03:07:50,440 --> 03:08:00,260
Whoa, you guys take a lot of explosive damage

2077
03:08:11,260 --> 03:08:13,260
Oh, no, he shot earth

2078
03:08:13,819 --> 03:08:17,020
Does that mean i'm huge?

2079
03:08:17,020 --> 03:08:23,420
How many you got in here?

2080
03:08:23,659 --> 03:08:25,659
You're gonna you're gonna fuck up my save state

2081
03:08:27,079 --> 03:08:29,079
Why am I killing these guys? I don't know

2082
03:08:30,149 --> 03:08:31,750
Why do you kill anybody in any video game?

2083
03:08:31,750 --> 03:08:36,149
It's because the computer decided that they were gonna be in front of you and they were a monster that you are

2084
03:08:36,149 --> 03:08:37,989
a bad guy

2085
03:08:37,989 --> 03:08:46,149
Oops

2086
03:08:46,149 --> 03:09:02,920
We're good. Uh, let me show you this way

2087
03:09:03,879 --> 03:09:06,889
this way

2088
03:09:06,889 --> 03:09:10,219
This way looks pretty ominous

2089
03:09:10,860 --> 03:09:14,700
What's over here? I was just here, right?

2090
03:09:16,059 --> 03:09:20,790
Yeah

2091
03:09:21,620 --> 03:09:32,569
I can't see shit

2092
03:09:33,290 --> 03:09:35,290
Good who else

2093
03:09:46,020 --> 03:09:50,659
Hey, wait, hey, hey, hey, hey, somebody just said game sucks. That's not fair

2094
03:09:52,950 --> 03:09:54,950
Why did you say that? That's not true

2095
03:10:00,620 --> 03:10:05,420
What's your reasoning what's your reasoning the floor is yours

2096
03:10:06,059 --> 03:10:18,090
I think that was the death

2097
03:10:18,090 --> 03:10:19,129
That's it

2098
03:10:19,129 --> 03:10:21,129
They don't say anything else. They just come in and say that

2099
03:10:30,760 --> 03:10:32,120
What's this gonna do?

2100
03:10:32,120 --> 03:10:36,870
What did that do? Oh, well did that?

2101
03:10:40,020 --> 03:10:45,909
Uh, we're up

2102
03:10:50,309 --> 03:10:52,469
Just running around and attacking things

2103
03:10:55,700 --> 03:10:57,620
You know

2104
03:10:57,620 --> 03:11:01,620
They don't make them like they used to anymore. They don't make them like this anymore

2105
03:11:02,579 --> 03:11:05,940
They don't make them like this anymore where you're just you're dead

2106
03:11:05,940 --> 03:11:10,340
It's just a game and I need to stop fucking like making little jokes

2107
03:11:10,979 --> 03:11:12,819
And get back up there

2108
03:11:12,819 --> 03:11:33,079
Those these guys live here. Why are you doing this?

2109
03:11:38,739 --> 03:11:42,420
Because it's like an evil castle or something with like demons and shit

2110
03:11:43,459 --> 03:11:45,459
Yeah, demons live in hell

2111
03:11:49,719 --> 03:11:51,719
What's the point there?

2112
03:11:54,600 --> 03:11:57,000
Load your quicksave am I am I fucked right now?

2113
03:12:01,399 --> 03:12:03,079
No, this is the the

2114
03:12:03,079 --> 03:12:05,940
Where's the elevator come down?

2115
03:12:05,940 --> 03:12:07,219
It goes down to where?

2116
03:12:07,219 --> 03:12:28,250
Where's that elevator?

2117
03:12:28,250 --> 03:12:30,809
Hold on. I'll get another 30 seconds and i'm gonna load the quicksave

2118
03:12:32,600 --> 03:12:33,959
30 more seconds

2119
03:12:33,959 --> 03:12:37,059
Hold on. I know it's like I can get there from here. I think

2120
03:12:52,649 --> 03:12:53,690
No

2121
03:12:53,690 --> 03:12:55,690
Stop wasting ammo too. What are you?

2122
03:12:56,010 --> 03:12:57,610
Insane

2123
03:12:57,610 --> 03:12:59,610
All right. I think i'm almost there

2124
03:12:59,610 --> 03:13:01,610
I'm gonna get there just in time

2125
03:13:12,760 --> 03:13:22,360
I'm gonna go

2126
03:13:24,360 --> 03:13:26,329
That was a bad idea

2127
03:13:26,329 --> 03:13:30,809
And now i'm way worse than I was off before

2128
03:13:31,370 --> 03:13:38,090
Everybody else left alive

2129
03:13:38,090 --> 03:13:42,180
So that's the way we gotta go

2130
03:13:42,180 --> 03:13:48,200
What's down here? Ooh green candies

2131
03:13:49,159 --> 03:14:10,260
One more out of both. How could you not like it?

2132
03:14:11,620 --> 03:14:13,620
It's got candy

2133
03:14:23,030 --> 03:14:26,790
I think the best part about this game is probably

2134
03:14:28,409 --> 03:14:31,860
I like how the weapons

2135
03:14:32,260 --> 03:14:34,260
The variety of weapons is pretty good

2136
03:14:39,270 --> 03:14:44,149
I think my favorite weapon is probably the

2137
03:14:45,270 --> 03:14:47,270
Thing i'm holding right now

2138
03:14:57,420 --> 03:14:59,260
But they're all good

2139
03:14:59,260 --> 03:15:05,110
Found it

2140
03:15:05,110 --> 03:15:07,110
somebody

2141
03:15:40,579 --> 03:15:56,680
I think I went this way already. Oh, there it is. Holy fuck. I almost just died dude

2142
03:15:56,840 --> 03:16:11,879
If I remember if I was standing over there it'd be like Neptune Mars Pluto

2143
03:16:13,510 --> 03:16:15,799
Mars

2144
03:16:15,799 --> 03:16:25,739
Uh, I don't know green

2145
03:16:27,020 --> 03:16:47,659
Nothing else up here. No sequence. Can we get an actual Neptune? You already have it. It's the worst emote on the channel

2146
03:16:48,459 --> 03:16:56,780
I know that's very debatable. But still that's a pretty hot topic

2147
03:17:02,340 --> 03:17:09,459
If you truly think that germapop is the worst emote on the channel, I i'm sorry, but we completely disagree

2148
03:17:10,739 --> 03:17:13,139
it's so much so

2149
03:17:13,139 --> 03:17:15,559
that I

2150
03:17:15,559 --> 03:17:19,239
That's like you telling me that almond joy is your favorite candy

2151
03:17:20,059 --> 03:17:22,020
I'm gonna say this

2152
03:17:22,020 --> 03:17:29,780
What are you talking about? Like like Reese's peanut butter cups exist. That's not possible. We just will never agree on anything

2153
03:17:30,500 --> 03:17:45,620
boss time

2154
03:17:45,620 --> 03:17:47,620
This kind of just looks and smells like a boss

2155
03:17:48,260 --> 03:17:51,819
What does that say?

2156
03:17:51,819 --> 03:17:53,819
You are being watched. I know

2157
03:17:55,579 --> 03:17:58,139
But by how many people do you know? Yeah, this is a boss

2158
03:17:59,299 --> 03:18:00,979
All right. Here's the deal

2159
03:18:00,979 --> 03:18:02,979
I know I hold on

2160
03:18:03,219 --> 03:18:06,819
This is going to be the last thing I do on the stream today. We'll see you tomorrow after this

2161
03:18:08,870 --> 03:18:12,229
For I don't know. Maybe maybe I'll convince someone to play halo

2162
03:18:13,030 --> 03:18:13,909
maybe

2163
03:18:13,909 --> 03:18:15,030
I don't know

2164
03:18:15,030 --> 03:18:16,469
It's possible

2165
03:18:16,469 --> 03:18:18,549
um

2166
03:18:18,549 --> 03:18:19,829
There's also

2167
03:18:19,829 --> 03:18:24,889
I'll be here before the stream starts tomorrow. There's a couple of games that i've been waiting to play

2168
03:18:25,930 --> 03:18:29,370
We'll see if I can get somebody to maybe play it if not if maybe i'll just

2169
03:18:30,329 --> 03:18:33,209
It's such a sour note at this point that like a halo I go

2170
03:18:33,770 --> 03:18:37,930
It's just I think it might need to exist as that whole it might just have to exist

2171
03:18:38,729 --> 03:18:43,819
That way. Oh, yeah, I also have a device. That's interesting that I want to play with

2172
03:18:44,979 --> 03:18:46,100
We'll see

2173
03:18:46,100 --> 03:18:53,530
I'll just do the campaign solo. Yeah, I might just like I don't know. We'll see it's gonna it'll be a game time decision

2174
03:18:54,889 --> 03:18:57,059
We'll figure it out tomorrow

2175
03:18:57,059 --> 03:18:59,059
But i'm still doing this

2176
03:18:59,459 --> 03:19:02,149
The corrupt spirit. Oh, it is an eye

2177
03:19:02,790 --> 03:19:11,799
A lot of health. Oh boy. All right

2178
03:19:12,840 --> 03:19:17,290
I think i'm just gonna dodge

2179
03:19:17,290 --> 03:19:25,159
I didn't have enough. Okay, you know

2180
03:19:34,950 --> 03:19:35,909
Ow

2181
03:19:35,909 --> 03:19:41,959
Am I even hitting him?

2182
03:19:41,959 --> 03:19:44,680
Ow, he's just throwing fucking cinder blocks at me

2183
03:19:45,399 --> 03:19:53,559
Ow, ow, ow

2184
03:19:53,559 --> 03:20:02,520
You can't really dodge him either

2185
03:20:02,760 --> 03:20:05,719
I think I just have to stand still and like just go back and forth like this

2186
03:20:06,840 --> 03:20:11,579
That's the play

2187
03:20:11,579 --> 03:20:16,299
What's phase two?

2188
03:20:16,299 --> 03:20:28,180
Is there a phase two?

2189
03:20:29,959 --> 03:20:32,840
Damn it. Damn it. Damn it. Damn it. Damn it. Damn it. Damn it. Damn it

2190
03:20:39,379 --> 03:20:41,379
oof oof oof

2191
03:20:41,940 --> 03:20:58,579
Did I actually get hit by that fucking thing?

2192
03:20:58,819 --> 03:21:00,180
Oh, man

2193
03:21:00,180 --> 03:21:01,620
I'm out of ammo

2194
03:21:01,620 --> 03:21:03,620
What do I have any ammo for any weapon?

2195
03:21:04,969 --> 03:21:06,969
I don't this is really bad

2196
03:21:07,770 --> 03:21:15,540
run away

2197
03:21:15,540 --> 03:21:17,540
Oh, I have to go up

2198
03:21:17,620 --> 03:21:19,620
Ow, please

2199
03:21:19,620 --> 03:21:24,860
No

2200
03:21:24,860 --> 03:21:28,739
Ben, how are you actually getting those in here?

2201
03:21:29,379 --> 03:21:33,129
I actually would rather be up here. This is a good spot for this

2202
03:21:33,930 --> 03:21:35,620
All right. I'm staying up here

2203
03:21:35,620 --> 03:21:39,909
Let's heal and let's use these

2204
03:21:40,069 --> 03:21:55,750
Are they reaching?

2205
03:21:55,750 --> 03:21:57,750
Here they come

2206
03:21:58,069 --> 03:22:05,940
Give me some help

2207
03:22:05,940 --> 03:22:12,950
Is he burning me?

2208
03:22:12,950 --> 03:22:26,120
He's putting fire down

2209
03:22:26,120 --> 03:22:29,000
Shit that hurt

2210
03:22:29,000 --> 03:22:32,200
Oh fuck this fire everywhere now. All right. Don't fuck this up. This took a long time

2211
03:22:33,000 --> 03:22:53,030
Oh fuck

2212
03:22:53,030 --> 03:22:55,030
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

2213
03:22:56,549 --> 03:22:59,209
Oh, no, no

2214
03:22:59,209 --> 03:23:08,489
Did it just don't die

2215
03:23:08,649 --> 03:23:15,590
Star of torment

2216
03:23:15,590 --> 03:23:19,110
I didn't even know this existed. I probably would have should I should have picked this up

2217
03:23:20,409 --> 03:23:24,299
Would have helped

2218
03:23:24,299 --> 03:23:26,299
You can die. I guess this doesn't matter the level's over

2219
03:23:27,020 --> 03:23:28,899
All right, get out

2220
03:23:28,899 --> 03:23:31,219
What about a secret though? I may have missed a secret

2221
03:23:32,020 --> 03:23:33,459
Not like it matters

2222
03:23:33,459 --> 03:23:46,889
I don't have I gotten one secret on any of the boss fights. I don't think I have

2223
03:23:47,530 --> 03:24:06,969
That's for another playthrough

2224
03:24:06,969 --> 03:24:08,569
And let's go

2225
03:24:08,569 --> 03:24:13,799
No secret

2226
03:24:13,799 --> 03:24:14,840
killer

2227
03:24:15,459 --> 03:24:16,579
Scholar

2228
03:24:16,579 --> 03:24:19,059
See you guys something not to read this stuff would you get achievements for it?

2229
03:24:27,100 --> 03:24:29,100
There are two more areas to do

2230
03:24:30,139 --> 03:24:31,909
I'm not gonna lie

2231
03:24:31,909 --> 03:24:33,909
I kind of like it medieval

2232
03:24:35,659 --> 03:24:36,940
as

2233
03:24:36,940 --> 03:24:41,579
A yeah, we can just keep playing that and just keep like slowly finish it. I like this

2234
03:24:49,290 --> 03:24:54,329
Up at the next time I play this it'll probably be over. It's a pretty fun. Just chill game to play

2235
03:24:55,129 --> 03:25:01,139
What are your first impressions? It's pretty it's good

2236
03:25:01,940 --> 03:25:06,299
Arcane expanse is the best area

2237
03:25:07,180 --> 03:25:10,819
It's a time for cleanup detail. No

2238
03:25:11,299 --> 03:25:13,299
No, we'll just look we're gonna start fresh tomorrow

2239
03:25:14,760 --> 03:25:18,360
If you missed the first part of this stream, it was a absolute shit show

2240
03:25:18,920 --> 03:25:21,319
But in somehow the best possible way, I think

2241
03:25:21,879 --> 03:25:23,879
It was a fucking disaster

2242
03:25:28,549 --> 03:25:32,260
But uh, we'll see you tomorrow

2243
03:25:32,260 --> 03:25:38,069
Thanks, uh again for uh box box for the raid if any of you guys are still here

2244
03:25:41,159 --> 03:25:43,159
Thanks for coming. Thanks for sticking around

2245
03:25:43,239 --> 03:25:53,209
See you tomorrow

2246
03:25:53,209 --> 03:25:55,209
What happened? We I just got here

2247
03:25:55,610 --> 03:25:57,510
uh

2248
03:25:57,510 --> 03:26:00,469
It's it's it's it's impossible for me to explain

2249
03:26:01,110 --> 03:26:03,110
the first two hours of the stream

2250
03:26:03,430 --> 03:26:04,950
it's kind of just

2251
03:26:04,950 --> 03:26:07,030
It was just it was

2252
03:26:07,030 --> 03:26:09,030
A wonderful disaster. We'll put it that way

2253
03:26:09,829 --> 03:26:12,069
Thank you for the halo diarrhea. You're very welcome

2254
03:26:16,180 --> 03:26:18,180
All right. Let's uh, let's call it a night

2255
03:26:18,659 --> 03:26:25,620
Start fresh tomorrow

2256
03:26:25,620 --> 03:26:40,090
Thanks for watching good stuff

2257
03:26:41,450 --> 03:26:45,290
Hey, let's just check it and see hey, who's top sub gifter richard nixon. Yep

2258
03:26:46,549 --> 03:26:50,149
Top bits I like to relish and top bits, too

2259
03:26:50,790 --> 03:26:53,190
Uh, I can't even read it. It was too small

2260
03:26:53,750 --> 03:26:59,379
Richard nixon. Thank you. Richard nixon for always giving 50 subs to stream somehow

2261
03:27:01,020 --> 03:27:02,139
I

2262
03:27:02,139 --> 03:27:06,629
I don't know. All right, let's head back to the

2263
03:27:08,149 --> 03:27:09,430
bits

2264
03:27:09,430 --> 03:27:11,590
Those of you that don't know

2265
03:27:11,590 --> 03:27:13,750
If you are a new viewer, I do not read

2266
03:27:14,549 --> 03:27:19,110
Subs or bits or donation or bit messages during the stream. We do it at the end

2267
03:27:19,750 --> 03:27:24,120
Let me just hang out for like 30 to 45 plus minutes and just chill and talk

2268
03:27:24,840 --> 03:27:26,280
That's how it works

2269
03:27:26,280 --> 03:27:34,180
Let's go back. Thank you to sad vega

2270
03:27:34,979 --> 03:27:36,739
for the 300 bits

2271
03:27:36,739 --> 03:27:40,899
Howdy germa just doing that reminder that we'd love to go through some emote options with a vote sometime

2272
03:27:41,459 --> 03:27:47,299
Still really looking to hold out for that weird emote of where they photoshopped the eye. So you looked

2273
03:27:48,340 --> 03:27:50,340
So, oh, yeah

2274
03:27:51,100 --> 03:27:53,459
Yep

2275
03:27:53,459 --> 03:27:56,020
The one that I thought was a real picture during the thing

2276
03:27:56,659 --> 03:28:05,719
Yep, it's a great picture. It is

2277
03:28:06,620 --> 03:28:08,620
It has to be an emote. It will

2278
03:28:08,620 --> 03:28:24,500
Thank you though

2279
03:28:24,500 --> 03:28:26,500
Lazy look. Thanks to the 250. Hey

2280
03:28:26,739 --> 03:28:33,750
Hey, how are you? That's it. Hey sad vega again for 300 bits. Thanks sad vega

2281
03:28:34,309 --> 03:28:37,270
I've said it before and i'll say it again house cleaning stream when

2282
03:28:37,989 --> 03:28:40,309
Just go pro it and clean your house

2283
03:28:40,790 --> 03:28:42,790
You seem to love vis or cleanup detail so much

2284
03:28:43,190 --> 03:28:47,350
You could easily make a joke video of you just cleaning a place with a mop and a bucket and chat would eat it up

2285
03:28:48,069 --> 03:28:51,909
Honestly, it doesn't even have to be your house. You can make like a joke studio set where you screw up

2286
03:28:54,440 --> 03:28:57,319
I think we've actually talked about that stream before

2287
03:28:58,569 --> 03:29:00,569
Of just cleaning a house on stream

2288
03:29:04,280 --> 03:29:08,139
What that's but it

2289
03:29:08,139 --> 03:29:10,139
Every time I think about how funny something like that could be

2290
03:29:11,159 --> 03:29:14,120
Like yes, imagine a scenario where I rent out a studio

2291
03:29:15,159 --> 03:29:19,319
And just make it just a dirty office or just like a dirty living room

2292
03:29:22,739 --> 03:29:25,700
Make it all dirty. So then I just clean the room

2293
03:29:28,979 --> 03:29:31,100
That stream would take

2294
03:29:31,100 --> 03:29:39,479
Hours to make it dirty and then hours to immediately clean it up would be so fucked up

2295
03:29:45,719 --> 03:29:51,020
But it would be fun

2296
03:29:51,020 --> 03:29:53,020
Maybe for a little while

2297
03:30:03,719 --> 03:30:05,719
vis or detail warp. Yeah

2298
03:30:08,489 --> 03:30:14,569
No, there's a lot of things that are in front of that that need to get done first before something like that would even be thought about

2299
03:30:16,250 --> 03:30:18,250
two or three fake rooms

2300
03:30:18,920 --> 03:30:22,120
Yeah, have like a fake house, but then I would rather just do the sims thing

2301
03:30:22,680 --> 03:30:24,979
All right, I told you about that how I wanted that

2302
03:30:26,889 --> 03:30:28,889
Just make in a studio

2303
03:30:29,530 --> 03:30:33,850
A big fake house and you guys control me and it's i'm just it's sim

2304
03:30:38,579 --> 03:30:40,579
I have to like pee and shit

2305
03:30:42,309 --> 03:30:46,549
I have to be I have to be like social I have to go do things. I have to like call people on the phone and stuff

2306
03:30:47,190 --> 03:30:57,639
We talk about a lot of weird shit here, but some of them actually turn into streams

2307
03:31:03,270 --> 03:31:05,270
Hey flug boy. Thanks for the 250

2308
03:31:05,670 --> 03:31:09,989
I honestly saw this from a fucking millennia away when you said joel was playing with you

2309
03:31:10,069 --> 03:31:15,030
I knew this was going to happen. I knew joel would have the attention span of a goldfish

2310
03:31:15,829 --> 03:31:20,950
But I love you both for this. Thank you for the stream reach is probably like one of my top 10 games of all time

2311
03:31:24,200 --> 03:31:36,420
That's so funny, I love it he foresaw it they both have the same attention span

2312
03:31:45,319 --> 03:31:48,120
Yeah, you just gave you gave two children the keys

2313
03:31:54,379 --> 03:31:57,420
But thank you flug boy. I still had a lot of fun

2314
03:32:00,620 --> 03:32:04,860
Hey grapple mace. Thanks for the 250. Jeremy, please play picross again sometime

2315
03:32:06,860 --> 03:32:08,860
Well, depending on how the stream goes tomorrow

2316
03:32:09,500 --> 03:32:14,780
You know this this this home. This might be an entire non-canon week

2317
03:32:16,069 --> 03:32:22,709
Depending on what happens tomorrow. We'll see

2318
03:32:27,899 --> 03:32:29,899
filler content week

2319
03:32:33,420 --> 03:32:41,540
We'll see the extended universe

2320
03:32:43,750 --> 03:32:46,440
I love picross. It's like it's one of my favorite

2321
03:32:47,159 --> 03:32:49,159
Lie down with your nintendo ds and do

2322
03:32:49,719 --> 03:32:54,280
It's like the reason why I even owned a ds was to play picross with the little stylus on the little screen

2323
03:32:55,159 --> 03:32:59,850
I didn't play a zelda game on that thing. I didn't buy pokemon

2324
03:33:03,100 --> 03:33:05,979
I did not own pokemon. I did not own I just

2325
03:33:08,469 --> 03:33:18,889
I bought it for picross

2326
03:33:18,889 --> 03:33:20,889
And there was another game too

2327
03:33:21,049 --> 03:33:23,420
What did I play on the ds sometimes?

2328
03:33:27,399 --> 03:33:31,319
Play pokemon tomorrow or riot lose 95 percent of your viewer base

2329
03:33:35,700 --> 03:33:40,020
If you're still here after the last two streams, I don't think I would lose 95 percent of you

2330
03:33:42,059 --> 03:33:43,340
Yeah

2331
03:33:43,340 --> 03:33:55,190
Let's be honest

2332
03:33:55,190 --> 03:33:57,190
Let's go. That's it. Let's get out of here

2333
03:34:02,059 --> 03:34:06,860
No, actually i'm i'm of the opinion that I I thought I thought the last two streams in a row were like

2334
03:34:07,500 --> 03:34:10,799
Fun like really fun, even though there was like a diarrhea

2335
03:34:11,940 --> 03:34:14,819
I thought I just I still had fun as the thing

2336
03:34:24,040 --> 03:34:26,040
Thank you post for the 500 bits

2337
03:34:26,520 --> 03:34:30,059
Has everyone been watching since the early tf2 days and you never failed to make me laugh

2338
03:34:30,780 --> 03:34:32,620
Your huge inspiration to me

2339
03:34:32,620 --> 03:34:34,620
as another guy with adhd

2340
03:34:34,780 --> 03:34:37,100
While I do respect it seeing you make the decision to move

2341
03:34:37,659 --> 03:34:41,100
To hospice care after your hernia really hit me hard. Here's to you

2342
03:34:41,739 --> 03:34:43,739
Jeremy will never forget you

2343
03:34:43,899 --> 03:34:49,579
Thanks a lot. Appreciate it. Thanks for the 500 bits

2344
03:34:52,020 --> 03:34:55,219
Hey, good night, man. Thanks for waking me up by my name a little while ago

2345
03:34:57,559 --> 03:35:06,340
That actually worked

2346
03:35:06,340 --> 03:35:12,969
Thank you post though for the 500 bits. Did I miss a 100 dollar bit donation? I missed 10 000 bits

2347
03:35:13,530 --> 03:35:14,809
long time ago

2348
03:35:14,809 --> 03:35:16,440
how

2349
03:35:16,440 --> 03:35:18,440
This is me and joe were arguing

2350
03:35:18,440 --> 03:35:19,559
about

2351
03:35:19,559 --> 03:35:22,360
Who was bullying the other one to play halo, which by the way

2352
03:35:24,040 --> 03:35:26,040
Like five days ago

2353
03:35:26,299 --> 03:35:30,219
I was like, hey you wanted to play let's play halo. Okay, sounds fun

2354
03:35:33,819 --> 03:35:36,059
And then he's and then he just fucking I could hack it

2355
03:35:36,780 --> 03:35:38,780
He did the thing on discord when it was like

2356
03:35:39,180 --> 03:35:41,420
You see, oh joe joe is typing

2357
03:35:41,979 --> 03:35:43,260
Not anymore

2358
03:35:43,260 --> 03:35:45,260
Joel is typing not anymore

2359
03:35:45,579 --> 03:35:46,940
Okay

2360
03:35:46,940 --> 03:35:48,940
Joel is currently typing and not anymore

2361
03:35:49,620 --> 03:35:51,690
Okay

2362
03:35:51,690 --> 03:35:55,370
And I got this this huge like holy shit, man, I really want to be really here like hey

2363
03:35:55,450 --> 03:35:57,450
I fucking don't even like that franchise

2364
03:35:58,010 --> 03:36:00,629
I'm gonna be i'm gonna be pretending

2365
03:36:01,610 --> 03:36:03,770
I know it's your favorite franchise of all time

2366
03:36:04,649 --> 03:36:10,200
But I can probably only I can probably only pretend for like two hours tops and I was like, it's all good, man

2367
03:36:10,200 --> 03:36:12,200
Whatever like you i'm sure you'll have fun

2368
03:36:12,760 --> 03:36:17,180
And then I was like I was i'm pretending too like i've played all these games already

2369
03:36:19,209 --> 03:36:23,049
I've beaten halo reach like 15 times like 10 times at least it's like one of my favorite games and i'm like

2370
03:36:23,049 --> 03:36:32,920
Oh my god, we'll just we'll just both pretend doesn't matter and he's like, all right, cool

2371
03:36:37,530 --> 03:36:39,530
I hate halo, too

2372
03:36:42,600 --> 03:36:45,079
That's my first experience with halo

2373
03:36:46,979 --> 03:36:53,879
Besides being on a college dorm room with an xbox chunky controller in my hand for five minutes

2374
03:36:57,739 --> 03:37:01,540
I wouldn't have it any other way. He thought you were a halo streamer

2375
03:37:06,950 --> 03:37:10,790
The whole thing is funny so it doesn't it's fucking hilarious

2376
03:37:16,549 --> 03:37:19,829
But i'm jared and gave 10 000 bits earlier

2377
03:37:21,559 --> 03:37:23,559
Thank you so much. I'm sorry. I missed it

2378
03:37:25,930 --> 03:37:28,809
There's a huge amount of money to miss and i'm really sorry that I did

2379
03:37:29,290 --> 03:37:31,530
I think that was in the middle of the crisis we were having

2380
03:37:33,690 --> 03:37:37,850
They said this has been the absolute best podcast i've ever listened to you. Thank you so much for this amazing time

2381
03:37:38,569 --> 03:37:43,610
We covered a few topics. Yeah

2382
03:37:43,610 --> 03:37:45,610
Hey smelly boy. Thanks for the 250

2383
03:37:46,729 --> 03:37:50,329
Hey germo, what's your opinion on sitting on the toilet looking at your phone and ruining?

2384
03:37:51,129 --> 03:37:52,170
the

2385
03:37:52,170 --> 03:37:56,889
Wait, what what's your opinion on sitting on the toilet looking at your phone and running the hair dryer on yourself all

2386
03:37:57,370 --> 03:37:59,370
At the same time when nobody is home

2387
03:38:01,590 --> 03:38:10,840
What like blow drying your hair while you're on the toilet?

2388
03:38:17,610 --> 03:38:20,420
What's my opinion on that?

2389
03:38:20,500 --> 03:38:25,270
um

2390
03:38:25,270 --> 03:38:29,559
You only have two hands

2391
03:38:29,559 --> 03:38:34,680
So if you're on the toilet and you have the iphone in one hand and a blow dryer on the other

2392
03:38:36,649 --> 03:38:38,299
How are you?

2393
03:38:38,299 --> 03:38:42,540
My opinion on is you don't have a third hand. What do you do you put the phone on the ground?

2394
03:38:42,540 --> 03:38:44,059
Do you don't have a pocket?

2395
03:38:44,059 --> 03:38:46,620
Put the blow dryer down on the floor

2396
03:38:47,739 --> 03:38:52,739
My opinion is

2397
03:38:52,739 --> 03:38:54,739
I don't like it. That's it

2398
03:38:56,780 --> 03:39:00,780
Uh gtx 1080 quad sli. Thanks for the 250 bits

2399
03:39:01,659 --> 03:39:06,420
Hello, jeremy. What's your recommended method of consuming a Reese's cup?

2400
03:39:07,139 --> 03:39:08,899
And why is it your favorite candy?

2401
03:39:08,899 --> 03:39:13,780
Anyways, can't wait to squad up with you in fortnight 2 tomorrow while eating the 25 meal deal

2402
03:39:14,579 --> 03:39:16,579
from burger king cheers

2403
03:39:16,819 --> 03:39:18,819
From that's not who sent the message

2404
03:39:22,139 --> 03:39:23,799
Uh, well

2405
03:39:23,799 --> 03:39:26,040
The how I eat Reese's all in one go

2406
03:39:27,989 --> 03:39:29,270
Open it up

2407
03:39:29,270 --> 03:39:33,510
Take the whole uh Reese's paper off and put the whole thing in my mouth

2408
03:39:34,229 --> 03:39:36,229
And slowly enjoy the the whole cup

2409
03:39:39,670 --> 03:39:43,829
And oh, there's no wrong with it. No wrong way to eat a Reese's. Yes. Yes, there is

2410
03:39:45,670 --> 03:39:50,790
I like oh, I put my tongue through it and push out the peanut butter and then I put with my hand

2411
03:39:51,030 --> 03:39:55,750
I put up my nose and swallow it through my nasal cavity. That's a wrong. That's wrong. Don't do that

2412
03:39:56,149 --> 03:39:58,549
What why do they people don't even eat Reese's like that?

2413
03:40:01,059 --> 03:40:03,379
There was a whole ad campaign. It was like well, how do you do it?

2414
03:40:03,540 --> 03:40:07,780
Well, I peel off the edges and then I dunk it in milk and then I I squish it between my teeth

2415
03:40:07,860 --> 03:40:11,299
No, you just eat it. You don't know. It's a candy. It's a fucking chocolate bar

2416
03:40:15,799 --> 03:40:18,280
Is it's not yeah, it's not an oreo. It's a Reese's

2417
03:40:23,639 --> 03:40:28,600
And by the way, there's only two ways to eat an oreo three what you either eat it just bite into it

2418
03:40:29,159 --> 03:40:32,780
Or you like do the turn and then you like I well what I do

2419
03:40:33,340 --> 03:40:37,579
Is I turn it and I look off the cream and then I that's what I do

2420
03:40:37,819 --> 03:40:40,540
Okay, that's the that's the second and out of two

2421
03:40:41,100 --> 03:40:45,959
ways to eat a oreo

2422
03:40:46,040 --> 03:40:56,469
Okay

2423
03:40:57,430 --> 03:41:01,190
Let me show you how a real man eats a chocolate sandwich cookie

2424
03:41:03,899 --> 03:41:05,899
That's all right. Here's how you do it

2425
03:41:06,379 --> 03:41:08,620
You take you grab the oreo

2426
03:41:09,260 --> 03:41:14,459
With your forceps and you know what that means. That's thumb and middle finger. Don't use your index finger

2427
03:41:14,459 --> 03:41:16,299
What are you out of your mind?

2428
03:41:16,299 --> 03:41:17,340
thumb

2429
03:41:17,340 --> 03:41:19,500
And index a thumb and middle finger

2430
03:41:20,379 --> 03:41:23,590
Grab the edge of the cookie lift up

2431
03:41:24,469 --> 03:41:27,510
Your fingers should be no more than halfway down the cookie

2432
03:41:28,899 --> 03:41:31,829
Okay, you then dunk that cookie

2433
03:41:32,629 --> 03:41:35,190
Not to the point where your fingers are touching the milk

2434
03:41:36,729 --> 03:41:38,729
a little bit less than halfway

2435
03:41:39,049 --> 03:41:42,329
Just let it sit there for about one. This is sippy two

2436
03:41:43,290 --> 03:41:44,569
three

2437
03:41:44,569 --> 03:41:46,809
Four lift it out

2438
03:41:46,809 --> 03:41:50,649
Tap tap tap on the edge to the excess milk bite into that

2439
03:41:51,739 --> 03:41:56,379
That's how you do it. Then you grab that little half moon that you have there hold it the other way

2440
03:41:56,379 --> 03:41:58,379
So it's you're holding it long ways now

2441
03:41:58,700 --> 03:42:00,700
And keep doing it in half and then you eat the whole thing

2442
03:42:06,219 --> 03:42:09,420
You do it for four seconds. No, just like bang bang

2443
03:42:10,139 --> 03:42:12,139
Bang done lift it out

2444
03:42:13,799 --> 03:42:19,100
On the edge. There you go

2445
03:42:19,180 --> 03:42:24,059
I will say that I don't I don't know how people eat oreos just dry

2446
03:42:24,860 --> 03:42:27,860
out of the can

2447
03:42:27,860 --> 03:42:30,100
Eating oreos is like eating saltines

2448
03:42:31,659 --> 03:42:33,659
It's like

2449
03:42:33,819 --> 03:42:46,860
I feel like I could cough and dust will come out of my mouth saltines are good. Yeah, I know

2450
03:42:47,860 --> 03:42:49,219
that but

2451
03:42:49,219 --> 03:42:53,219
It's like eating a saltine if you eat just a if you eat a raw oreo cookie

2452
03:42:54,260 --> 03:42:57,459
It's just like it turns into this weird sandy dusty mush

2453
03:43:00,309 --> 03:43:02,629
I love these hot take sections of the stream

2454
03:43:09,879 --> 03:43:13,700
What do you think a cookie is

2455
03:43:13,700 --> 03:43:17,219
Okay, let's go another layer. We'll go one more step here

2456
03:43:18,920 --> 03:43:19,959
uh

2457
03:43:19,959 --> 03:43:21,799
should a cookie be

2458
03:43:21,799 --> 03:43:23,100
soft

2459
03:43:23,100 --> 03:43:25,979
Or soft and chewy or crunchy and brittle

2460
03:43:26,709 --> 03:43:30,069
This is going to determine how many of you get removed from the channel

2461
03:43:37,020 --> 03:43:40,020
Well, most of you get to stay

2462
03:43:45,780 --> 03:43:47,780
soft and chewy cookies

2463
03:43:50,409 --> 03:43:53,100
are just

2464
03:43:53,100 --> 03:43:57,180
the best

2465
03:43:57,180 --> 03:44:00,860
crunchy cookies

2466
03:44:00,860 --> 03:44:02,389
No

2467
03:44:02,389 --> 03:44:06,600
No, I wouldn't

2468
03:44:06,600 --> 03:44:08,340
I don't hate

2469
03:44:08,340 --> 03:44:10,180
hard and crunchy cookies

2470
03:44:10,180 --> 03:44:12,649
But there is a line

2471
03:44:12,649 --> 03:44:14,889
Where if you bite into if I bite into a cookie

2472
03:44:16,219 --> 03:44:28,309
And it turns into five cookies that's unacceptable and that's what happens a lot of times

2473
03:44:33,270 --> 03:44:36,629
Soft chewy you can just bite into it. It's it's

2474
03:44:37,250 --> 03:44:39,690
moldable

2475
03:44:39,690 --> 03:44:41,739
They're durable

2476
03:44:41,739 --> 03:44:44,379
If you drop a soft cookie on the ground, it's not going to shatter

2477
03:44:45,180 --> 03:44:49,129
If you drop hard cookie on the ground it shatters and then you're gonna you can't eat it anymore

2478
03:44:54,440 --> 03:45:02,840
Shatterproof this idiot eats cookie dough

2479
03:45:04,940 --> 03:45:08,739
uh

2480
03:45:08,739 --> 03:45:10,979
Is that some kind of strange unpopular opinion?

2481
03:45:12,120 --> 03:45:13,319
to like

2482
03:45:13,319 --> 03:45:16,469
cookie dough

2483
03:45:16,469 --> 03:45:22,709
Cookie dough. It's a it's everywhere. It's in every ice cream shop. It's the most popular ice cream

2484
03:45:23,329 --> 03:45:25,329
flavor, it's the most

2485
03:45:25,430 --> 03:45:31,270
Every cookie dough is like synonymous with a lovely thing that everybody likes. That's like saying you don't like bacon

2486
03:45:31,270 --> 03:45:45,770
What are you not epic?

2487
03:45:45,770 --> 03:45:48,329
Hey a pink iru. Thanks for the thousand bits

2488
03:45:53,670 --> 03:45:54,790
Thank you

2489
03:45:54,790 --> 03:45:58,440
They say thank you for providing a ton of laughs and giving us an escape from reality

2490
03:45:59,079 --> 03:46:02,520
Life can get us down sometimes but a laugh in a tough moment can make all the difference

2491
03:46:03,319 --> 03:46:08,280
Going through a rough bit a bit of a rough patch and your streams are always the highlight of my week

2492
03:46:08,840 --> 03:46:12,840
Watching you and Joel interact made me laugh the hardest I have in months. I can't wait for the next one

2493
03:46:14,329 --> 03:46:16,219
Neither can I

2494
03:46:16,219 --> 03:46:20,069
Should be a lot of fun

2495
03:46:20,069 --> 03:46:22,309
Thank you so much for the thousand bits. Thanks for hanging out

2496
03:46:26,299 --> 03:46:27,799
I am

2497
03:46:27,799 --> 03:46:31,819
Absolutely honored to be the highlight of your week

2498
03:46:35,700 --> 03:46:39,100
Thank you

2499
03:46:39,100 --> 03:46:41,100
Thank you for the one thousand

2500
03:46:41,659 --> 03:46:45,180
Bits

2501
03:46:45,180 --> 03:46:49,399
Let's get the credits rolling

2502
03:46:49,399 --> 03:46:51,399
That means we change scenes

2503
03:46:51,399 --> 03:46:57,860
I know how to stream

2504
03:46:57,860 --> 03:46:59,860
Thanks for watching guys. We'll see you tomorrow

2505
03:47:04,229 --> 03:47:09,639
Thank you for all the subs all the support as always much love to all of you. Thank you

2506
03:47:12,200 --> 03:47:15,399
Whether you sub today or whether you've been subbed for six years

2507
03:47:15,959 --> 03:47:28,329
Thank you. You haven't finished the bits. Um, I will don't worry

2508
03:47:28,889 --> 03:47:36,340
Don't worry. I've been subbed for a year and I just realized I need new sub

2509
03:47:37,139 --> 03:47:44,059
I need new sub badges. It's just coming up on that point where I never thought that was even going to be a thing

2510
03:47:45,909 --> 03:47:49,829
Looking down that way. Oh three two three year sub badges

2511
03:47:50,629 --> 03:47:52,870
I was like, I don't think that'll ever happen

2512
03:47:53,030 --> 03:47:58,229
I don't know. I don't think people will sub for three straight years, but I guess it'll be here and now it

2513
03:47:58,469 --> 03:48:01,450
that's a reality a lot and

2514
03:48:03,139 --> 03:48:05,940
That you could do four five six years in a row

2515
03:48:07,659 --> 03:48:08,940
Holy shit

2516
03:48:08,940 --> 03:48:15,139
Who would sub for that long? Ew

2517
03:48:15,540 --> 03:48:20,379
one of our founders

2518
03:48:20,379 --> 03:48:22,790
grump clump

2519
03:48:22,790 --> 03:48:24,790
49 month subscriber

2520
03:48:26,579 --> 03:48:32,819
That's a long time

2521
03:48:32,819 --> 03:48:38,569
But thank you again. Seriously, let's continue with the bits. We still have a little bit to do

2522
03:48:40,459 --> 03:48:43,180
Uh syroc. Thanks to the 250 they say oi

2523
03:48:43,899 --> 03:48:45,899
I am les francais

2524
03:48:45,899 --> 03:48:48,139
Yeah, we say bieux instead of bia

2525
03:48:48,860 --> 03:48:53,100
Wine bieux cheese bieux french fries bieux ratatouille bieux

2526
03:48:54,139 --> 03:48:59,510
Thanks to 250

2527
03:48:59,510 --> 03:49:03,350
Thank you the thrill for the fifteen hundred bits fifteen dollars from the thrill

2528
03:49:05,829 --> 03:49:09,590
I expect that this was going to be a flawless stunning playthrough of halo reach instead

2529
03:49:09,590 --> 03:49:13,590
I watched over an hour or so of what was a hilarious chaotic and truly beautiful disaster

2530
03:49:14,229 --> 03:49:16,309
One hell of a 26th birthday gift

2531
03:49:17,590 --> 03:49:19,190
Let's love friendo

2532
03:49:19,190 --> 03:49:23,129
Thank you

2533
03:49:23,129 --> 03:49:25,510
Thank you so much

2534
03:49:25,510 --> 03:49:27,030
somebody mentioned

2535
03:49:27,030 --> 03:49:28,840
uh something

2536
03:49:28,840 --> 03:49:34,040
They said that one of the levels we were on had like a par of 15 minutes and we had just been doing

2537
03:49:34,840 --> 03:49:37,000
Nothing for I think 30 or 40 straight minutes

2538
03:49:39,260 --> 03:49:40,459
but

2539
03:49:40,459 --> 03:49:44,860
Happy 26th birthday. Hope you had a good one

2540
03:49:48,500 --> 03:49:50,500
Thank you so much for the 1500 bits

2541
03:49:50,659 --> 03:49:52,760
Happy 26th birthday

2542
03:49:52,760 --> 03:49:54,760
He's gonna forget the birthday again. It's not time

2543
03:49:55,940 --> 03:50:00,250
It's not time

2544
03:50:00,250 --> 03:50:03,049
I still have a full day and a half. What do you mean? It's not time for that

2545
03:50:03,690 --> 03:50:06,299
I remember

2546
03:50:06,299 --> 03:50:08,299
Uh eugene. Thanks for the 250

2547
03:50:09,290 --> 03:50:11,290
When are you going to apologize to fortnight jimmy?

2548
03:50:11,850 --> 03:50:16,760
I already did

2549
03:50:16,760 --> 03:50:21,959
Sergio, but thanks for the 250 sergio, but serious question. Do you eat starburst with or without the paper on?

2550
03:50:26,340 --> 03:50:27,780
you just

2551
03:50:27,780 --> 03:50:28,899
unlocked

2552
03:50:28,899 --> 03:50:30,729
in my head

2553
03:50:30,729 --> 03:50:35,690
Something that I haven't even you've unlocked something. I don't know what it was you unlocked

2554
03:50:37,659 --> 03:50:39,100
I did do this

2555
03:50:39,100 --> 03:50:41,420
But well, I don't think it was with starburst. What was it with?

2556
03:50:43,350 --> 03:50:45,350
I had this very very

2557
03:50:45,670 --> 03:50:49,270
Distinct memory of chewing on paper and moving it around and moving it

2558
03:50:56,059 --> 03:50:59,690
What was that?

2559
03:50:59,690 --> 03:51:01,690
No, not tootsie rolls not tootsie rolls

2560
03:51:03,590 --> 03:51:05,590
What was it? It was paper and I remember

2561
03:51:06,659 --> 03:51:08,659
No, not cupcake wrapper

2562
03:51:13,819 --> 03:51:16,149
shit

2563
03:51:16,149 --> 03:51:19,430
the candy dots

2564
03:51:19,430 --> 03:51:21,110
I think you got it

2565
03:51:21,110 --> 03:51:24,709
Yeah, I used to I used to tear off a piece and I would just put the whole thing in my mouth and chew on it

2566
03:51:24,709 --> 03:51:26,709
And just pick it off and spread it around

2567
03:51:30,680 --> 03:51:32,680
Yep. Yeah, that's what it was

2568
03:51:33,239 --> 03:51:34,600
I would just

2569
03:51:34,600 --> 03:51:37,399
Tear off a piece and I would just stick it in there and just slowly

2570
03:51:38,200 --> 03:51:43,319
Mush it around in my mouth and gums and stuff until it popped off and then I would move the paper to the side

2571
03:51:45,879 --> 03:51:49,959
Anyways, um, no, I didn't I did not do that with starburst. I did that with the dot the candy dots

2572
03:51:52,579 --> 03:51:55,620
Yeah, yeah the candy buttons that were on the sheet of paper

2573
03:51:56,340 --> 03:52:02,680
Those things were awesome, too. They even still make those

2574
03:52:03,399 --> 03:52:05,899
Probably buy them on amazon or something

2575
03:52:07,739 --> 03:52:11,420
Also, praise that son bro. Thanks for the 500 bits

2576
03:52:12,379 --> 03:52:14,620

2577
03:52:15,260 --> 03:52:18,620

2584
03:52:45,620 --> 03:52:47,620
Is it a driving test?

2585
03:52:50,409 --> 03:52:53,049
Driving your cdl driver's test

2586
03:52:53,690 --> 03:52:56,090
It's for a driver's life. Oh, well fucking hell. Yeah

2587
03:52:56,889 --> 03:53:02,360
You can use that five thousand dollars and get yourself a honda civic

2588
03:53:03,079 --> 03:53:05,079
Well, you you were here earlier, right?

2589
03:53:05,399 --> 03:53:14,180
You had to have been here it allows for trucking and taxi driving. Oh shit

2590
03:53:15,879 --> 03:53:20,649
Well, nice job

2591
03:53:20,649 --> 03:53:24,329
Get the tesla truck. I have not you know, you want to talk about hot takes

2592
03:53:25,129 --> 03:53:27,290
I've not even given you my take on the tesla truck

2593
03:53:29,610 --> 03:53:31,770
But it's it's at this point. I've already i've said

2594
03:53:33,000 --> 03:53:36,840
I just imagine the words that I would have said you already know the people have already made the jokes a thousand times

2595
03:53:38,889 --> 03:53:45,610
I I can't it's been too long. I I could say oh yeah, nintendo 64 car. You've seen that on twitter probably a thousand times

2596
03:53:48,059 --> 03:53:50,620
I could say it looks like it's made out of aluminum foil

2597
03:53:51,260 --> 03:54:03,020
You've probably heard that already

2598
03:54:03,020 --> 03:54:06,659
So there you go. Just that's what I that's my take

2599
03:54:11,190 --> 03:54:14,469
Please only original jokes and the windows. Yeah, I know the windows though

2600
03:54:15,510 --> 03:54:17,510
You can't break them. I broke it

2601
03:54:19,750 --> 03:54:21,750
Right. Yeah, we all know this already

2602
03:54:22,309 --> 03:54:25,850
They don't have any wait, hold on for a second

2603
03:54:25,850 --> 03:54:29,049
I I was about to get really really really crazily upset about what you just said

2604
03:54:29,530 --> 03:54:31,530
I thought you said they don't have any cup holders

2605
03:54:31,770 --> 03:54:39,299
It's like how do you make a but what do you mean? No cup holders in the whole car?

2606
03:54:44,620 --> 03:54:46,620
Not having a cup holder

2607
03:54:52,950 --> 03:54:56,899
You drink from a hose

2608
03:54:56,899 --> 03:55:00,420
There are no mirrors. No, there there has to be mirrors as it gets illegal

2609
03:55:06,340 --> 03:55:08,979
No mirrors or what's what the crumple zone?

2610
03:55:09,780 --> 03:55:21,219
What is a crumple zone?

2611
03:55:21,219 --> 03:55:24,899
Crumple zone that sounds like a section of like a disney park

2612
03:55:27,610 --> 03:55:31,690
Like crumples zone. It's like a gnome or something crumple zone

2613
03:55:32,329 --> 03:55:39,430
So it's like a crash zone

2614
03:55:42,600 --> 03:55:44,600
It's for crashes so you don't fucking die

2615
03:55:53,860 --> 03:55:56,260
Well, okay, welcome to the crumple zone

2616
03:56:02,260 --> 03:56:06,819
Yeah, guys the if you get a tesla truck, you know, it's gonna just sit in your driveway

2617
03:56:06,899 --> 03:56:08,899
So people look out the window and go, ooh

2618
03:56:10,729 --> 03:56:12,889
You know what? You're gonna be you're not gonna be worried about crumple zones

2619
03:56:21,270 --> 03:56:23,270
Oh, that looks dumb

2620
03:56:24,469 --> 03:56:28,920
Oh

2621
03:56:28,920 --> 03:56:31,799
I'm worried about crumple zones. You're a pluto

2622
03:56:36,780 --> 03:56:41,899
I think it looks cool. You know what?

2623
03:56:43,340 --> 03:56:45,340
Let me see tesla truck

2624
03:56:47,959 --> 03:56:52,120
Okay, I wish I could see I feel like we only have one angle of this thing

2625
03:56:52,520 --> 03:56:54,520
Do they have any video of it driving?

2626
03:56:55,610 --> 03:57:00,329
I feel like i've only seen an image of this thing from the side. What does this thing actually even look like?

2627
03:57:06,860 --> 03:57:08,860
Oh shit, this thing is actually kind of cool

2628
03:57:17,110 --> 03:57:18,709
That's what it looks like

2629
03:57:18,709 --> 03:57:21,540
No, that's a different company

2630
03:57:21,540 --> 03:57:23,540
That's a different company

2631
03:57:23,620 --> 03:57:26,090
Okay, never mind

2632
03:57:26,090 --> 03:57:33,100
That one looks cool. That's a cool looking one this thing called called the

2633
03:57:33,979 --> 03:57:36,409
the neuron

2634
03:57:36,409 --> 03:57:38,409
the neuron ev

2635
03:57:38,489 --> 03:57:40,489
That thing is fucking sick

2636
03:57:41,049 --> 03:57:52,920
Look at this thing. Yeah, i'll show you here. Let me put it on

2637
03:57:53,559 --> 03:58:02,329
This thing's called the neuron the neuron

2638
03:58:14,069 --> 03:58:16,069
That's pretty cool looking

2639
03:58:16,069 --> 03:58:21,370
Look at that thing

2640
03:58:21,370 --> 03:58:24,489
That's ugly. No, not the one on the right. I'm talking about the one on the left

2641
03:58:26,840 --> 03:58:29,340
You're a fucking neuron

2642
03:58:29,340 --> 03:58:32,520
What?

2643
03:58:32,520 --> 03:58:34,520
You don't think that that's like that?

2644
03:58:34,600 --> 03:58:39,930
That looks better

2645
03:58:39,930 --> 03:58:41,930
That one doesn't have any doors

2646
03:58:43,770 --> 03:58:46,579
How do you get in?

2647
03:58:47,219 --> 03:58:49,219
It's remote controlled

2648
03:58:50,969 --> 03:58:54,010
You sit on top of it. It doesn't have any doors

2649
03:58:54,889 --> 03:58:57,209
You sit in the back

2650
03:58:57,209 --> 03:59:00,329
All in the back of the pickup load part you sit back there with a wheel

2651
03:59:05,540 --> 03:59:10,899
I think that's a cool. It's I think it's all right. Look at what's what look that actually has like a back

2652
03:59:11,700 --> 03:59:13,700
No, there are no crumple zones

2653
03:59:20,780 --> 03:59:23,020
Looks like mario kart. We will I mean, okay

2654
03:59:23,100 --> 03:59:26,540
It looks it does look like an upgraded thing you can get in mario kart

2655
03:59:30,540 --> 03:59:32,940
That's the cool car that you get in mario kart. Yes

2656
03:59:37,940 --> 03:59:41,459
All right. I will agree the one on the right the one on the right is a little is a little weird

2657
03:59:42,420 --> 03:59:43,540
it

2658
03:59:43,540 --> 03:59:46,180
Is that even a is that a okay? So take a look?

2659
03:59:46,979 --> 03:59:49,290
the one on the right

2660
03:59:49,290 --> 03:59:51,290
Is that the car or is

2661
03:59:52,379 --> 03:59:56,459
It's just a giant shark fin. Why would you do that? Why would you drive that?

2662
03:59:58,700 --> 04:00:00,379
that's

2663
04:00:00,379 --> 04:00:02,379
That's really stupid

2664
04:00:03,020 --> 04:00:04,139
This is huge

2665
04:00:04,139 --> 04:00:09,819
You're gonna go through like a drive-through and you're gonna hit the top of the sign that says like please god

2666
04:00:09,899 --> 04:00:14,219
Don't fucking drive a car here if you're larger than you know what i'm talking about that sign

2667
04:00:15,100 --> 04:00:19,030
I would go into tunnels and scream going through the tunnels

2668
04:00:23,579 --> 04:00:25,100
It's a semi

2669
04:00:25,100 --> 04:00:34,420
Also, it goes back. Okay. I thought it was just like a flounder. I think that one looks all right

2670
04:00:39,239 --> 04:00:40,700
electric

2671
04:00:40,700 --> 04:00:47,559
Truck, it was that the only two of them. What about this one?

2672
04:00:48,280 --> 04:00:52,360
the rivian r1 rivian r1 t

2673
04:00:53,479 --> 04:00:55,479
Let's see. What's fine. When you guys like

2674
04:01:00,979 --> 04:01:04,260
This one's uh, all right. Okay. Hold on. Hold on a second

2675
04:01:08,729 --> 04:01:11,420
Hold on. What do you think about this one?

2676
04:01:15,659 --> 04:01:17,659
this one in particular is

2677
04:01:18,139 --> 04:01:20,139
You you had to create a character

2678
04:01:21,000 --> 04:01:23,319
And you took and you went to the part where it said nose

2679
04:01:23,959 --> 04:01:25,959
And you dragged the nose just forward

2680
04:01:26,440 --> 04:01:37,260
What do you think about this one? That's got a is that a crumple zone? I think that might be a crumple zone

2681
04:01:41,000 --> 04:01:43,159
Is it I see mirrors and I see a crumple zone

2682
04:01:43,799 --> 04:01:55,000
Is this truck even electric?

2683
04:01:55,000 --> 04:01:57,000
It's got a big nose. Whatever

2684
04:02:03,500 --> 04:02:06,700
I mean the truck look the back of the truck doesn't look very big

2685
04:02:08,309 --> 04:02:12,149
You I think you can only fit a refrigerator in there and you have to stand it straight up

2686
04:02:14,260 --> 04:02:16,260
This is the car that bugleberry would drive

2687
04:02:16,659 --> 04:02:28,760
Why do I know what you mean?

2688
04:02:28,760 --> 04:02:34,500
I like that one

2689
04:02:34,500 --> 04:02:35,930
five

2690
04:02:35,930 --> 04:02:42,969
Buy a fridge and then go through the drive-through to hit the sign is that your goal is to fucking wreck the sign

2691
04:02:48,489 --> 04:02:53,450
anyways, um

2692
04:02:53,450 --> 04:02:56,170
I don't even we're okay. So we were

2693
04:02:57,420 --> 04:02:59,420
All right, right praise that son

2694
04:03:00,200 --> 04:03:02,370
Congratulations on passing you cdl

2695
04:03:02,389 --> 04:03:04,379
Thanks for the 500 bits

2696
04:03:04,379 --> 04:03:09,739
Thank you put that put that license to good use

2697
04:03:12,260 --> 04:03:14,260
And then finally we had uh

2698
04:03:14,639 --> 04:03:16,639
psychilos for the 500 bits

2699
04:03:17,819 --> 04:03:21,100
Jerma jeremy and the jerma and the baby is my favorite video of yours

2700
04:03:21,100 --> 04:03:24,139
And I was wondering when we can expect the sequel i've been waiting for six years

2701
04:03:26,180 --> 04:03:28,180
I'm not having any kids

2702
04:03:28,180 --> 04:03:37,059
I'm not having any kids

2703
04:03:37,059 --> 04:03:44,729
No children for me

2704
04:03:44,729 --> 04:03:47,930
No, baby albertson. No not in the plans not on the plans

2705
04:03:51,639 --> 04:03:54,840
I'd rather be the the fun uncle that everybody likes

2706
04:03:55,639 --> 04:04:02,170
That works for me

2707
04:04:02,170 --> 04:04:04,010
Auto is all we need

2708
04:04:04,090 --> 04:04:11,770
I don't know. You're not gonna pass on the funny jeans pepe hands

2709
04:04:15,239 --> 04:04:17,239
No, i'll freeze it. I'll freeze them

2710
04:04:18,500 --> 04:04:20,500
What? Okay, let's keep going

2711
04:04:20,659 --> 04:04:21,780
That was weird

2712
04:04:21,780 --> 04:04:23,780
a bro bought

2713
04:04:30,899 --> 04:04:38,170
I'm just gonna freeze myself so I can like

2714
04:04:46,250 --> 04:04:50,170
That's not what you were saying i'm gonna freeze myself

2715
04:04:51,590 --> 04:04:54,069
And uh in a thousand years

2716
04:04:55,479 --> 04:04:59,479
When they're going through we're gonna go find like the funny people where were they here they are

2717
04:04:59,879 --> 04:05:05,639
Well, we still have it's still available. Jerma 985 is still available. We can we can keep that line going

2718
04:05:17,860 --> 04:05:19,860
Your humor will be too outdated

2719
04:05:21,530 --> 04:05:34,100
That was a good attempt, but uh, the ship is sinking. Oh, you better pick up a pail and start dumping water

2720
04:05:39,190 --> 04:05:42,969
Uh, but uh bro bought formerly soft boy. Thanks the 251

2721
04:05:44,329 --> 04:05:46,649
Hey jerma reach was hilarious a hot mess

2722
04:05:47,290 --> 04:05:49,290
I'm looking forward to what you and joel do together next

2723
04:05:50,170 --> 04:05:53,290
When it when it comes to halo i'm kind of glad this stream turned out this way

2724
04:05:53,850 --> 04:05:56,489
Reach is amazing, but it has heavy themes towards the end

2725
04:05:56,969 --> 04:06:01,930
The first halo game halo combat evolved is pretty easy to set up for pc would really recommend playing that one first

2726
04:06:02,569 --> 04:06:04,569
Reach wouldn't be a bad way to follow it up

2727
04:06:05,129 --> 04:06:09,129
While you're waiting for two and three the main trilogy is comparable to star wars

2728
04:06:10,819 --> 04:06:12,819
Do hand sim co-op with joel?

2729
04:06:12,979 --> 04:06:19,899
Okay, and by the way, we can we can get tired of that in two hours. It don't matter

2730
04:06:26,680 --> 04:06:28,680
We got a halo expert. Yeah

2731
04:06:29,860 --> 04:06:31,299
No, that's good to know

2732
04:06:31,299 --> 04:06:34,010
That is good to know

2733
04:06:34,010 --> 04:06:36,010
And you know what else you're about to know?

2734
04:06:41,799 --> 04:06:51,260
That we've reached the end. Thanks again for watching. Thanks for participating. Thanks for hanging out in this

2735
04:06:52,620 --> 04:06:54,620
messy non-canon

2736
04:06:54,620 --> 04:06:56,620
uh stream

2737
04:07:00,469 --> 04:07:05,590
I'll see you guys tomorrow. The plan tomorrow is wherever the wind decides to take us

2738
04:07:05,750 --> 04:07:08,950
Because there are a few things we can do depending on

2739
04:07:10,309 --> 04:07:14,950
Who or what is doing things tomorrow? I might try to do maybe we'll try halo again

2740
04:07:15,909 --> 04:07:18,950
That's kind of funny to me that I just pretend like I didn't try yesterday

2741
04:07:19,909 --> 04:07:21,909
um

2742
04:07:21,909 --> 04:07:23,750
There's also

2743
04:07:23,750 --> 04:07:26,069
Well, let me just rifle off the things that are on my mind here

2744
04:07:28,229 --> 04:07:30,229
There's also

2745
04:07:33,879 --> 04:07:36,700
All right, are you ready for this

2746
04:07:36,700 --> 04:07:38,500
there is

2747
04:07:38,500 --> 04:07:41,639
Dead rising 3

2748
04:07:41,639 --> 04:07:44,280
I still have to play the rest of the fear stuff

2749
04:07:45,770 --> 04:07:47,430
fear 2

2750
04:07:47,430 --> 04:07:49,510
The dlc for fear fear 2 has a thing

2751
04:07:57,909 --> 04:08:01,299
We'll see

2752
04:08:01,459 --> 04:08:03,780
No, please no, please not dead rising 3

2753
04:08:06,870 --> 04:08:09,510
I did say that I had to beat it though. I had to do it

2754
04:08:10,809 --> 04:08:12,809
Play the new nancy drew game

2755
04:08:20,409 --> 04:08:23,610
I promised when did I promise I was gonna play nancy drew?

2756
04:08:24,569 --> 04:08:35,780
What are you talking about?

2757
04:08:36,780 --> 04:08:39,979
Nancy drew dead rising 3. Yeah, that's I know that's what i'm saying

2758
04:08:44,069 --> 04:08:46,229
No dead rising 3. Fuck that

2759
04:08:48,329 --> 04:08:54,489
damn

2760
04:08:54,489 --> 04:08:59,770
All right, just because one guy said that i'm gonna look up nancy drew games that have come out on steam
