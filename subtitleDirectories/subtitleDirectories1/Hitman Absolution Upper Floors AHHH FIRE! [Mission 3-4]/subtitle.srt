1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:12,820
Hey, what is going on, everybody? Welcome back to more Hitman Absolution.

2
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:17,820
This is going to be the second part of the Terminus mission, the Upper Floors.

3
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:19,820
So let's go. Welcome back.

4
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:29,260
Yeah, well, I pretty much just killed, like, everybody downstairs.

5
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:31,260
There was a lot of people that didn't die.

6
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:33,259
Uh-huh. Seal up tight.

7
00:00:35,429 --> 00:00:39,429
Come on! I didn't do anything. I wanted to hear what they were saying.

8
00:00:39,429 --> 00:00:43,429
You know what, buddy? I'm going to restart this mission, but just because you are a jerk,

9
00:00:43,429 --> 00:00:49,429
I'm going to blow your faces off! All three of you! Yeah!

10
00:00:49,429 --> 00:00:55,179
Alright, so I guess how it works is if you are disguised as a group of people,

11
00:00:55,179 --> 00:01:00,179
they will see through your disguise. That group will see through your disguise more often than not.

12
00:01:00,179 --> 00:01:04,180
So you can't just, like, walk into groups of people that I'm disguised as.

13
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:08,489
I know. Too bad. That's too bad.

14
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:17,629
I don't know where to go. There's people everywhere here, man. Where am I supposed to go?

15
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:24,709
Let's follow this lady. Maybe not, because she's in, like, somebody's room.

16
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,930
Point of interest. Over here. Alright.

17
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
A lot of paintings on the wall.

18
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,180
I thought there was blood all over the ground here. It's flowers.

19
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:44,180
I thought somebody got, like, riddled with bullets in this hallway for a second.

20
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:47,629
Indicates a nearby fire escape.

21
00:01:47,629 --> 00:01:49,939
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

22
00:01:49,939 --> 00:01:53,799
There's nobody even here. What? Who am I hiding from?

23
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:57,230
Was I not supposed to come in this room? I probably wasn't, like, allowed in here,

24
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:59,230
because, I mean, it did say do not disturb, so.

25
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:03,920
This lady's like, uh, sir, what the hell are you doing over there?

26
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,360
Nothing, I'm just standing here. Hi.

27
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:11,360
Alright, let me, will you get out of the way, bitch?

28
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,539
I didn't mean to call you bitch, but you're just getting on my nerves. Alright.

29
00:02:14,539 --> 00:02:16,030
What is this?

30
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:21,099
The musician won't leave his room without a reason, so this guy apparently...

31
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:23,099
Is anybody even in here?

32
00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:24,099
Oh, he's right there.

33
00:02:24,099 --> 00:02:27,860
Is he just in there rocking out, playing the guitar?

34
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:33,560
Well, sorry, dude. I'm ruining your stuff.

35
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:37,819
Can I go, I can't go out this window. Can I just, like, crouch back here?

36
00:02:37,819 --> 00:02:42,770
No, no, get in this thing! Get in here! Quick! Get in!

37
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:48,659
Alright, is he coming out? Yeah, he is.

38
00:02:48,659 --> 00:02:52,659
Oh, your room is crazy, man. I can't wait to go in there and break those lights.

39
00:02:52,659 --> 00:02:59,960
Uh, you're gonna have to turn around, so...

40
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,960
If I come at it, he's gonna see me!

41
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:06,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah, make your way to that speaker. Go fix it.

42
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,169
There's a problem there. You're gonna have to deal with it.

43
00:03:09,169 --> 00:03:17,490
Oh, boy. Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy. He doesn't know I was here. Oh, boy.

44
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:21,259
He's still fixing his stuff. What am I doing here?

45
00:03:21,259 --> 00:03:24,210
What the hell am I supposed to do in here? There's a bottle.

46
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:30,289
Uh, sure. This room is gonna make me, like, start to hallucinate.

47
00:03:30,289 --> 00:03:34,830
Oh, he's back. He's back! He's back!

48
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:38,099
What am I doing here?

49
00:03:38,099 --> 00:03:40,099
I like, I broke in this guy's room for, like, no reason.

50
00:03:40,099 --> 00:03:46,180
Wait a minute. Um, I think I'm gonna have to bottle this guy in the face.

51
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:48,479
That's really my only solution.

52
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:52,849
Because I don't know what to do, but I'm gonna hide his body. Don't worry.

53
00:03:52,849 --> 00:03:57,889
Oh, that didn't even work! Come here!

54
00:03:57,889 --> 00:04:01,340
Alright, we're good. We're good.

55
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:06,490
Okay, I'm good. Nobody heard that. Nobody saw that.

56
00:04:07,979 --> 00:04:09,979
Now I can, can I take his disguise? I cannot.

57
00:04:09,979 --> 00:04:15,699
Can I play his keyboard? Let's hope so.

58
00:04:15,699 --> 00:04:20,740
Dump his body in here.

59
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:22,740
I can't believe the bottle. I didn't, like, hurt him.

60
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:27,180
I threw a bottle at this guy's face and it, like, didn't do anything.

61
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:29,180
I should probably put the shotgun away. That would be a bad idea.

62
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:33,980
Pizza? I'll take a slice.

63
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:38,709
So what was the purpose of this room?

64
00:04:38,709 --> 00:04:40,709
This son of a bitch had nothing in here for me to do.

65
00:04:40,709 --> 00:04:44,399
There's gotta be something in here. Why would, why would I be coming in here?

66
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:48,990
Oh, wait a minute.

67
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:52,579
Mmm, whoa. This is, no, this is the same...

68
00:04:52,579 --> 00:04:58,420
Can I go with the window? Is there any, oh, there's a window.

69
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:02,860
Fire extinguisher? Nah, I don't think I want that.

70
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:05,860
This guy's got food literally everywhere. What a freak.

71
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:13,000
I don't know. Let's go.

72
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,689
So maybe I had to come through there? Ooh, can I go, oh!

73
00:05:16,689 --> 00:05:24,180
I can, like, go up here, can't I? That's where the guy is. That's where, like, the target is.

74
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:30,149
Climb. If this, there's not some guy just standing right here, is there?

75
00:05:30,149 --> 00:05:36,850
Oh lord. Progress is only saved to, oh yeah, definitely activate the checkpoint.

76
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:41,750
Minus one thirty five oh, god damn it.

77
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:45,949
Well, what's, whoa, whoa, see ya!

78
00:05:45,949 --> 00:05:49,319
Oh my, oh my!

79
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:53,839
That's a long, oh, he just broke his back! Wow!

80
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:59,370
Well, why do I always do that to people?

81
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:01,370
I always do that to people!

82
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:06,620
I probably could've just let that guy, like, smoke his cigarette or whatever he was doing and he could leave.

83
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:11,689
You think this guy's gonna be suspicious that his, like, best friend just is not here anymore?

84
00:06:11,689 --> 00:06:15,019
Maybe I can pull this guy out too. Do I have anything?

85
00:06:15,019 --> 00:06:18,379
No, I don't, can I make any noise? No, I don't think so.

86
00:06:18,379 --> 00:06:21,949
Uh, only one guy in here.

87
00:06:21,949 --> 00:06:27,240
Will you get out of the way? I don't, this guy's gonna see me walk by, go.

88
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:35,480
Okay, I need a new disguise, man. I can't just be, like, walking around.

89
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:41,329
Maybe these guys will have a conversation. Maybe not.

90
00:06:41,329 --> 00:06:44,699
I have to, there's really no other way unless I go down.

91
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:50,410
I don't really wanna go down. This is gonna take a little bit of thought, hold on.

92
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:56,699
Uh, I can go in here, but these guys are in there.

93
00:06:56,699 --> 00:07:03,089
Come to the window. Come over to the window and take a look.

94
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:06,089
You're gonna meet the same fate as your friend.

95
00:07:07,089 --> 00:07:10,290
No, this guy's still just staring at me.

96
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:18,230
Damn it! Wait, is that the target right there?

97
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:20,470
Um, I guess I can drop down.

98
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:26,040
But then again, I wanna be, like, up on this top floor, don't I?

99
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:33,540
We'll see. Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.

100
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:36,740
I might be able to get behind this guy right now.

101
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:40,319
No, there's another guard in here. Damn it!

102
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:47,189
Let's go down. Looks like I can get in this way.

103
00:07:47,189 --> 00:07:52,589
Hop down again, maybe? No, that's it.

104
00:07:52,589 --> 00:07:58,069
I can either go up, I have to go in this door, or this window.

105
00:07:58,069 --> 00:08:00,980
Damn it, man.

106
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:05,300
Now that these guys are all the way to the back, I'm gonna try and distract them.

107
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:08,120
I got an idea. I got an idea.

108
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:11,699
At least, oh, you know what, I can just try and do some crazy stuff right now

109
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:13,699
because I do have that checkpoint right there.

110
00:08:13,699 --> 00:08:17,019
So, let's just go in.

111
00:08:17,019 --> 00:08:20,019
When this guy turns around again, I'm going in this window.

112
00:08:20,019 --> 00:08:25,250
Turn around, come on. Turn around.

113
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:29,899
I'm gonna ask you nicely one more time, and then I'm pulling out the gun.

114
00:08:29,899 --> 00:08:33,669
And I'm gonna shoot you in your face.

115
00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:39,950
Turn around. Turn around! Turn around, there we go!

116
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:44,299
Turn around, that's what I like to see.

117
00:08:44,299 --> 00:08:47,610
Okay, I have reached the eighth floor.

118
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:57,350
My word, this is gonna take a lot of, like, good, like, stealth.

119
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:59,350
Oh, the piano. I can knock the piano thing down?

120
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:03,919
Oh, boy. Oh, boy, oh, boy.

121
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:07,340
Oh, boy. Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy!

122
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:10,409
No, no, no, no, no, no, don't come over here.

123
00:09:10,409 --> 00:09:14,120
Do not come over here.

124
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:18,320
This is the most nerve-wracking thing ever.

125
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,690
So, if I knock down that piano pin, is there a place for me to hide?

126
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:25,100
Can I hide in the fireplace? Hmm.

127
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,789
I know what I'm gonna do.

128
00:09:27,789 --> 00:09:30,289
I'm gonna grab the bottle, I'm gonna throw the bottle over there,

129
00:09:30,289 --> 00:09:34,830
and I'm gonna try and make my way silently out the left side.

130
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:35,830
There's only one guy there.

131
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:43,340
Let me go bottle, and throw it over there, and wait for them to freak out.

132
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:50,009
Yeah, yeah, go! Whoa, right there!

133
00:09:50,009 --> 00:09:51,009
There's a guy right there!

134
00:09:51,009 --> 00:09:53,139
Knock this down.

135
00:09:53,139 --> 00:09:58,980
Oh, no, now that's all of them, all of them, all of them, all of them, all of them.

136
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:01,820
Am I actually gonna get away with this?

137
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:03,820
How the hell did I not get spotted right there?

138
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:04,820
Are you kidding me?

139
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:07,730
I need that bottle.

140
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:12,309
Oh, I need to just go in the room behind me, but I can't.

141
00:10:12,309 --> 00:10:14,309
I'm gonna alert this whole entire upper floor.

142
00:10:14,309 --> 00:10:19,299
Good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good.

143
00:10:19,299 --> 00:10:24,830
Are you? Come here.

144
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:25,830
Come here, you!

145
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:27,330
Come here, you son of a bitch!

146
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:30,379
Quiet! Just be quiet! Shut up!

147
00:10:31,879 --> 00:10:35,250
What do I go? What do I go?

148
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:36,250
Is there anybody in this hall?

149
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:38,419
Come on, come this way, this way, this way, this way, come on.

150
00:10:38,419 --> 00:10:39,419
Give me your disguise.

151
00:10:39,419 --> 00:10:44,100
No, get up, get up.

152
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,529
Get up, get in here.

153
00:10:45,529 --> 00:10:48,539
There's so many people on this top floor.

154
00:10:48,539 --> 00:10:51,740
Oh, I got up to 12,000 points, guys.

155
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:53,740
Doing things correct.

156
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:54,740
What do you know?

157
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:56,299
Doing things correctly.

158
00:10:56,299 --> 00:10:59,110
Now where on earth am I going?

159
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:02,019
Okay, don't want to go that way.

160
00:11:02,019 --> 00:11:05,409
Did I just, is this the exit? Did I do this?

161
00:11:05,409 --> 00:11:08,820
Pick lock?

162
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:11,639
Ooh, I'm picking the lock.

163
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:14,289
This is where I gotta go.

164
00:11:14,289 --> 00:11:15,289
I think I just did it.

165
00:11:15,289 --> 00:11:17,490
I just did it!

166
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:18,490
No, I didn't.

167
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:21,200
No, I didn't.

168
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,340
Not quite.

169
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:25,220
This is the room, though.

170
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:29,269
Is this something I gotta do?

171
00:11:29,269 --> 00:11:30,269
What's that?

172
00:11:30,269 --> 00:11:31,269
A direct approach is not an option.

173
00:11:31,269 --> 00:11:32,269
I need an alternate point of entry.

174
00:11:32,269 --> 00:11:33,269
All right, well, here we go.

175
00:11:33,269 --> 00:11:37,669
I'll come in like a spider.

176
00:11:37,669 --> 00:11:38,669
I'll snatch you up.

177
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:47,110
She's worth a lot of money.

178
00:11:51,549 --> 00:11:53,549
So that's the target.

179
00:11:54,549 --> 00:11:55,919
All right.

180
00:11:55,919 --> 00:11:58,500
Come at me, bro.

181
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,500
What's going on?

182
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,500
I don't like drugs.

183
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:01,500
What's going on?

184
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,500
I'm on like drugs right now.

185
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:06,620
What's happening?

186
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:08,950
I think it's...

187
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:09,950
What's...

188
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:11,450
I did it.

189
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:12,450
Nice.

190
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:14,580
All right.

191
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:15,580
I unlocked some things, too.

192
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:16,580
Hey, that's not bad.

193
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:18,580
That's not bad.

194
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:21,580
I'll take a minus 5,000 points.

195
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:25,190
But I got 12,000 for the first part.

196
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:26,190
Oh, the second part.

197
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:28,250
Let's take a look.

198
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:29,250
Nine to...

199
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:30,250
Oh!

200
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:35,789
I killed 11 people downstairs.

201
00:12:35,789 --> 00:12:38,480
Well, that could have been like a good score

202
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,480
if I didn't murder 11 people.

203
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,419
All right, let's keep going here.

204
00:12:42,419 --> 00:12:46,009
Hey, how are you?

205
00:12:46,009 --> 00:12:47,820
That's a big dude.

206
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:49,820
Oh, you're getting choked out, baby.

207
00:12:51,509 --> 00:12:52,509
That didn't work.

208
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:57,070
No, because I'm Hitman, baby.

209
00:12:57,070 --> 00:12:59,269
What?

210
00:13:02,389 --> 00:13:03,759
Are you kidding me?

211
00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:05,700
I look pale.

212
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,700
No, he's a goddamn Hitman.

213
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:12,700
He's a goddamn Hitman.

214
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:21,700
That's a Hitman.

215
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:22,700
That's a Hitman.

216
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:29,340
Everyone's got such a naughty, vulgar mouth.

217
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:38,220
Listen to all these, like, swears.

218
00:13:42,259 --> 00:13:46,100
That guy's like nine feet tall.

219
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:55,460
This guy is a creep.

220
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:57,460
Look at this guy's face.

221
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:00,460
This guy is a creep.

222
00:14:02,149 --> 00:14:04,970
Oh, boy.

223
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:08,590
That's not good.

224
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:18,779
All right, so this guy's like framing me for this murder

225
00:14:18,779 --> 00:14:20,779
that I just did, apparently.

226
00:14:20,779 --> 00:14:23,860
Now he's going to torch the place?

227
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:27,700
Oh, what a son of a bitch.

228
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:37,340
Well, that's one way to go about getting yourself framed.

229
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:39,769
I didn't do it, I swear.

230
00:14:40,769 --> 00:14:41,940
Please don't kill me.

231
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:54,860
Whoa.

232
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:58,700
Run for your life.

233
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:01,320
All right, let's run for our lives.

234
00:15:03,139 --> 00:15:05,139
So the guy that I just went to kill

235
00:15:05,139 --> 00:15:08,139
torched the room and framed me.

236
00:15:08,139 --> 00:15:10,139
He killed some maid over here.

237
00:15:10,139 --> 00:15:12,139
And now these police think that I did it.

238
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:14,379
Welcome to Escape the Hotel.

239
00:15:14,379 --> 00:15:15,379
Here we go.

240
00:15:17,259 --> 00:15:18,259
I have no idea where on earth I'm going.

241
00:15:18,259 --> 00:15:19,259
Let's go this way.

242
00:15:20,259 --> 00:15:21,879
Fire, fire.

243
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:23,879
Somebody put out your fire.

244
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:26,500
Through here.

245
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,500
Of course.

246
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,960
At least I got the knife.

247
00:15:31,259 --> 00:15:32,259
Wow.

248
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:35,830
Can only go one way.

249
00:15:37,649 --> 00:15:38,649
They got a helicopter on me?

250
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:40,820
What is America's most wanted?

251
00:15:42,129 --> 00:15:43,129
My god, stop it.

252
00:15:43,129 --> 00:15:44,129
Leave me alone.

253
00:15:44,129 --> 00:15:47,539
I got to climb up.

254
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:51,700
So wait, wait, wait.

255
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:54,700
You're telling me that from that like little bottle of whiskey

256
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:55,700
that that guy was...

257
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:57,700
Oh, wow.

258
00:15:58,700 --> 00:15:59,700
Am I going to get hit by that?

259
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:04,289
You're trying to tell me what I was saying was

260
00:16:04,289 --> 00:16:06,289
the little thing of whiskey that that guy poured on the ground.

261
00:16:07,289 --> 00:16:12,289
You're telling me lit the hole, engulfed this entire hotel in flames.

262
00:16:13,289 --> 00:16:14,289
Are you kidding me?

263
00:16:15,289 --> 00:16:17,289
That's pretty ridiculous.

264
00:16:18,289 --> 00:16:19,289
Whoa.

265
00:16:19,289 --> 00:16:20,289
Wow.

266
00:16:20,289 --> 00:16:21,289
Wait, that's a guy right there.

267
00:16:21,289 --> 00:16:22,289
How are they on the roof already?

268
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:28,750
Can they?

269
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:29,750
It's like they can't see the smoke.

270
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,500
All right, so see through the smoke.

271
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,500
Go, go, go.

272
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,500
You can't see me.

273
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,580
You can't see me.

274
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:37,580
I'm good.

275
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,840
Can I hop over?

276
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:43,210
I can't even hop over this way, can I?

277
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:45,960
Get me over here.

278
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:48,419
Damn it.

279
00:16:48,419 --> 00:16:49,419
It's all right.

280
00:16:49,419 --> 00:16:50,419
They can't see.

281
00:16:50,419 --> 00:16:53,769
They can't see anything right now.

282
00:16:54,769 --> 00:16:56,460
What's that?

283
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:57,950
I'll take the wrench.

284
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:02,340
Can I hop over this is the question at hand?

285
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:03,519
Nope.

286
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:04,519
I'll wait for them to go down.

287
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:07,910
Come on, get out of the way.

288
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:09,980
Oh, I got an idea.

289
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:11,160
Go get it, officers.

290
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,160
There's a wrench over there.

291
00:17:15,059 --> 00:17:16,059
Only one of you is going to go over there and do that?

292
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:19,710
No, wait, that guy's going over here.

293
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:21,710
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

294
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:22,710
Hurry up and go look at the wrench.

295
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:24,710
Do you have to like phone it in where you're going?

296
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:27,210
Go, go, go.

297
00:17:27,210 --> 00:17:32,349
Good.

298
00:17:32,349 --> 00:17:36,579
Sneak through the pipes here.

299
00:17:36,579 --> 00:17:40,059
Hey, look at that.

300
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:41,059
Beautiful.

301
00:17:41,059 --> 00:17:42,359
Get me the hell out of here.

302
00:17:43,789 --> 00:17:44,789
There's the exit.

303
00:17:44,789 --> 00:17:45,789
There's the exit.

304
00:17:45,789 --> 00:17:46,789
There's the exit.

305
00:17:46,789 --> 00:17:48,029
Break the door down.

306
00:17:49,029 --> 00:17:51,910
The question is, did I make it?

307
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:52,910
Probably.

308
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:55,559
Whoa.

309
00:17:55,559 --> 00:18:00,359
That's a pretty dramatic entrance.

310
00:18:00,359 --> 00:18:05,289
Chicago's finest.

311
00:18:05,289 --> 00:18:06,660
Where's he at, boys?

312
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:13,140
And that's going to wrap it up for this episode, ladies and gentlemen.

313
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:18,140
I will see you guys all for the next part where I try to escape from the Chicago Police Department.

314
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:20,140
But yeah, that'll be pretty soon here, guys.

315
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:22,140
So thanks so much for watching.

316
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:23,140
I really do appreciate it.

317
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:25,140
And take care, everybody.
