1
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:15,289
Hold on now, hold on, just a second here. I need to go like this. Okay, so, uh, we are going without

2
00:00:15,289 --> 00:00:21,879
notifications tonight, so no, uh, there will be no sub or bit notifications on the screen,

3
00:00:21,879 --> 00:00:32,380
because obviously this is, uh, German wrestling. This is Germany in 2018. I'm gonna give it a

4
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:37,820
little bit for people to show up, because I heard that there were some issues with Twitch.

5
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:43,020
I don't know how widespread they are. I don't know how fucked up they are,

6
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:48,219
but, uh, want to make sure that the stream actually goes through to people and,

7
00:00:49,020 --> 00:01:01,060
you know, works. So give me just a moment. I know I wanted to start originally like 20

8
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:07,400
or 30 minutes ago, but, uh, we're going to take a little bit of time. I wanted to make

9
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:12,760
sure I was done before 5 Pacific, because that's too long, but it's ready. It's done.

10
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:18,549
It's ready to go. So just give me a moment. We'll talk. Actually, we could bring up a couple

11
00:01:18,549 --> 00:01:22,709
things before this starts. Hey, you know, I'm going to milk the absolute hell out of this.

12
00:01:22,709 --> 00:01:27,269
You know what I mean? Hold on a second. Let's talk about a few things, because the stream

13
00:01:27,269 --> 00:01:33,829
is probably only going to be two or three hours long, because, you know, it is what it

14
00:01:33,829 --> 00:02:12,219
is. But, uh, give me one second. I will be right back. Tata for a second. Shouldn't I be a

15
00:02:12,219 --> 00:02:22,939
little more excited for this? Oh, the rumble is here. I'm like, okay, guys, let's talk about

16
00:02:22,939 --> 00:02:31,610
a few things first of all. Okay. So let's, let's go over just a few stream related things.

17
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:40,469
No, but this is very, very, very important. Next weekend is the green screen movie night.

18
00:02:40,469 --> 00:02:49,419
Now, if you have not submitted your, uh, your piece of art, then I advise you to do so before

19
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:56,099
the 29th. If you are curious of the rules, they're all posted in that discord channel.

20
00:02:56,099 --> 00:03:01,699
There's a pinned message. Go read on the green screen submission channel. There's a pinned

21
00:03:01,699 --> 00:03:05,379
bunch of rules. Read them. You got to have your video on YouTube. It's got to be uploaded

22
00:03:05,379 --> 00:03:09,699
to YouTube. No Reddit videos, no discord videos. Got to, it's going to go into a

23
00:03:09,699 --> 00:03:16,379
giant YouTube playlist. So please go read those rules. I want to make sure I say that again,

24
00:03:16,379 --> 00:03:21,050
cause we're doing that next weekend. If you're like, what the fuck am I supposed to do? Just

25
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:31,020
go take a look. Pin message. All right. So, uh, I was, I was at Starbucks today and man,

26
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:35,419
what, what's the deal with their large? You know what I mean? It's like not even bigger

27
00:03:35,419 --> 00:03:44,280
than the medium. It's like two ounces bigger. Are you guys ready? Are you guys ready to do

28
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:51,319
this? The reason why I'm stalling. It's only been four minutes. What? Not even stalling.

29
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:55,400
But here's the reason why. The last couple of times I've done this,

30
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:00,280
a bunch of people have missed the first two matches or so because, oh shit,

31
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:07,539
I got a notification. The stream just started. I spent like 44 hours on this. So like,

32
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:10,340
I'm going to milk it. I'm going to sit here and talk about my Starbucks trip.

33
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:26,759
Ah, play a 10 minute drum roll. Uh, by the way, um, there are, there are 36 characters

34
00:04:29,379 --> 00:04:32,420
and I think only two or three of them are returning characters.

35
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:45,050
I went, I went fucking crazy and just made 35, 34 people. So there's a, it's not,

36
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:50,810
let's look at it this way. It's not just like, cause let's say, you know, usually I spend a

37
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:56,250
lot of time on these, but you know, I got the complaints about Falco, about Wolf,

38
00:04:56,250 --> 00:05:03,660
about Star Fox. I got the complaints about it. Nobody wants to see seven serpents in a rumble.

39
00:05:07,899 --> 00:05:14,439
So, uh, there, there are no clones. Well, actually hold on a minute. That might,

40
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:23,899
that might not be entirely true. And everybody's here except for everyone beside,

41
00:05:23,899 --> 00:05:27,740
like from like a year ago. None of them are there from like a year and a half ago.

42
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:31,100
It's all people from the last year. So everyone from this last year is here,

43
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:38,220
except for the, everybody else. There you go. All right. What do you say we get it done?

44
00:05:39,449 --> 00:05:45,800
Let's start. Jamania 2018. What told you I was going to look, I told you I was going to get

45
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:50,519
done before December. Everyone was yelling at me. Oh, there's no way he is going to have

46
00:05:50,519 --> 00:06:00,579
enough time. Oh yeah. 36 fucking characters. Can you hear it? You can hear it. I don't,

47
00:06:00,579 --> 00:06:03,060
I don't want to spoil it. Hopefully this is set up correctly. If not,

48
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:12,779
I'm going to fucking shit my pants. But anyways, welcome everybody to Jamania 2018.

49
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:30,970
Hey, where are we? Where are we? Hey, where do you think we are?

50
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:35,370
Where do you think we are right now? I'll tell you where we are. We're in beautiful

51
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:41,420
Las Vegas, Nevada. Just waiting for it to pop up on the screen to prove that I've been

52
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:58,279
Las Vegas. San Diego. That's not real. There we are, ladies and gentlemen in San Diego.

53
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:03,560
I turned the music off. I don't want this. I'm going to get copyright strike.

54
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:17,379
All right, here we go. It's time for it to begin. First match of the evening coming up

55
00:07:17,379 --> 00:07:25,290
right now. It's an extreme rules match. One on one. I fucking hate this music.

56
00:07:28,339 --> 00:07:32,500
Don't delete me. How do I like, hold on. I got to like be really, really loud

57
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:44,060
because this is going to mute the VOD. Don't delete this. But anyways guys,

58
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:47,259
welcome to the first match of the evening. This is one that I'm going to put this to

59
00:07:47,259 --> 00:07:52,600
rest forever. I cannot wait until this, this argument that I've made for the last

60
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:58,870
almost full fucking year is, is just stupid at this point. And you'll see what I'm talking

61
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:02,579
about. Oh, you didn't do it. You didn't do it. You didn't kill this guy. You didn't

62
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:10,899
beat this guy first try. That's fine. We'll find out tonight what really is going on

63
00:08:10,899 --> 00:08:16,490
because we got the first match of the evening out of five total here is

64
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:24,899
Jerva985 in a one on one match. Looking old as shit. Losing his hair.

65
00:08:24,899 --> 00:08:32,470
That's what I look like right now. Somebody just went out. Jerva985 is

66
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:41,860
getting a little higher in age, as I just said. 30, 33. I feel 53. And it's funny

67
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:47,740
because every time we do one of these rumbles, I always make me how I currently feel.

68
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:53,590
That's how I feel right now. Like I, the last time I was like fat,

69
00:08:54,389 --> 00:08:59,639
you did boo with me and that's fine. You boo me on my own channel. I don't give shit.

70
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:10,789
But who could I be facing to finally put this bullshit to rest forever?

71
00:09:10,789 --> 00:09:16,309
Ladies and gentlemen, my opponent for the first match of the evening

72
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:22,039
is one of the easiest bosses in Dark Souls. That's right. We're talking about a person

73
00:09:22,039 --> 00:09:31,830
that I absolutely did not lose to. That's Pinwheel! Extreme rules. One on one.

74
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:44,789
Will I beat Pinwheel again without dying? Because that's what I did. Will I do it?

75
00:09:45,509 --> 00:09:53,350
And then we can stop this. Whatever happens here on out. If I lose, I'll accept it.

76
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:56,549
If I win, you all gotta stop that shit. This ain't even, this ain't a meme stream,

77
00:09:56,549 --> 00:10:06,710
but I'm telling you. We're making the canon tonight. Go get him. Go get him.

78
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:12,309
What is he doing? He's, he's being a, I don't know. He's being a slow Dark Souls boss.

79
00:10:12,549 --> 00:10:18,820
An easy boss. But I will absolutely beat within five minutes. Because I'm the one in control,

80
00:10:20,409 --> 00:10:24,250
as you'll see very plainly. But I've gotten older. No entrance music. And there's a very

81
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:29,610
good reason for that. Apparently, you can get, you can get in trouble with copyrighted

82
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:43,299
music these days. So I've heard. No entrance music. Really is. Let's go. Hurry up. Get the

83
00:10:43,299 --> 00:10:52,549
fuck in there, Pinwheel. He has taken a long time. What? Jerma's outside the ring, getting ready.

84
00:10:53,509 --> 00:10:58,309
Starting his new exercise routine. Well, Pinwheel really milks this intro for good measure.

85
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:05,799
What a good way to make sure everybody gets here. And there it's all angry. Oh dear,

86
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:09,720
you suck. You lost to Pinwheel. No, I didn't. And I'm about to prove it right now.

87
00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:16,039
Welcome to Germania 2018. Ring the bell. One-on-one extreme rules. Jerma versus Pinwheel.

88
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:22,679
Couple of right-handed punches there to start. Jerma is old, but can still hang with a young

89
00:11:22,679 --> 00:11:28,919
kid. Right into the turnbuckle, his face goes. Twice. Three. Four. Five. Six. Seven. Eight. Nine.

90
00:11:28,919 --> 00:11:36,919
Ten. Eleven. Eleven times. Ooh, Jerma with a little stomp there, but he missed. Got him in

91
00:11:36,919 --> 00:11:40,679
a headlock. No, he's gonna go. Ooh, a little elbow to the face. Pinwheel now on the

92
00:11:40,679 --> 00:11:47,000
reversal. Into the corner, Jerma goes. Pinwheel. Uh-oh. He's turning him upside down. He's

93
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,320
tying him. He's tying Jerma to the turnbuckle and now stepping on his face.

94
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:57,480
That was an interesting tree of woe there by Pinwheel. Is that made out of concrete?

95
00:11:59,379 --> 00:12:04,820
That's not gonna win. No, no, no. That's one. There's no way I'm gonna lose that one.

96
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:08,580
I'm not gonna get pinned after getting my hit. Ooh, what a beautiful break dance move

97
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:14,899
into a Jerma Suplex by Jerma. Absolutely fantastic. You can hear the crowd. Half of

98
00:12:14,899 --> 00:12:20,870
them really getting behind me. Half of them yelling about how short I am. And another

99
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:27,240
200 people screaming about how I lost. You can really hear. Oh, what a miss by Pinwheel

100
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:32,179
there. Can Jerma capitalize on it? No, he's gonna get. Oh, what a reverse neckbreaker

101
00:12:32,179 --> 00:12:37,320
there by Pinwheel on Jerma 985. He dropped the 985 recently in recent years. I'm not

102
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:43,509
sure why that is. Maybe it's because no. Ooh, beautiful reversal. Maybe it's because

103
00:12:43,509 --> 00:12:48,070
numbers back in the day of YouTube where everybody had a numbered channel. But you

104
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:52,009
didn't even really. I don't know why. And people had their birthdays. Why would you

105
00:12:52,009 --> 00:12:56,250
ever put your birthday online for a bunch of people to see? And now it looks like Jerma

106
00:12:56,250 --> 00:13:00,870
is gonna try the same technique on Pinwheel. The crowd didn't really like that, but it

107
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:06,419
wasn't gonna be enough. Let's see. One. No, only one. Only one. Now remember,

108
00:13:06,419 --> 00:13:12,820
this is an extreme rules matchup. So that means every... I'm pretty sure.

109
00:13:13,379 --> 00:13:18,460
Whoa, what a hurricane run. A springboard. We saw him do these moves in the green screen.

110
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:22,759
Now he's setting up for a special move, I think. Yep, it's called the whoops-a-daisy.

111
00:13:22,759 --> 00:13:28,149
That's old Jerma's special technique, the whoops-a-daisy. He grabs you by the wrist

112
00:13:28,149 --> 00:13:33,700
and just falls backwards as you lie down on your back, too. Jerma into the corner.

113
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:39,029
Are we gonna see? Uh-oh. Are we gonna see it? Are we gonna see the diaper? No,

114
00:13:39,029 --> 00:13:43,019
that wasn't the diaper. I thought it was gonna be the diaper. That was the double

115
00:13:43,019 --> 00:13:48,279
fisted. Uh-oh, he's going to the top rope. Got up there real quickly. What are we gonna

116
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:56,139
see from Jerma? Oh, the stomp. The step on your chest. And that's gotta be it.

117
00:13:56,139 --> 00:14:02,299
That has to be it. One. Two. Oh, just barely. He didn't make it. Pinwheel just

118
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:08,009
barely got out of that one. I was like, somebody better check his shoes.

119
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:12,360
Somebody check Jerma's shoes. I think there's fucking weights in there.

120
00:14:13,429 --> 00:14:18,220
He might be cheating. He doesn't want to be lambasted and accused and made

121
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:21,419
fun of for the rest of his life. People are cheering. Pinwheel now.

122
00:14:21,419 --> 00:14:26,620
He's got him in the submission lock. Is Jerma gonna... No! He... Oh, I thought he tapped

123
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:32,940
out for a second. I was about to scream. Oh, out to the outside we go and Jerma's

124
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:37,899
feeling the adrenaline. You can just smell his armpits from here. They smell like

125
00:14:37,899 --> 00:14:42,460
Dove Men plus Care and he's going to the top rope. He's pointing down. This is a daredevil

126
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:49,879
move here from Jerma. Will he? What's he gonna do? Holy shit! I don't know what. That

127
00:14:49,879 --> 00:14:53,559
was so unnecessary. That hurt Jerma probably more than it hurt Pinwheel.

128
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:59,769
All I did was hurt my legs. Why wouldn't you kick him? Why wouldn't you jump on him?

129
00:14:59,769 --> 00:15:07,299
And now a DDT into the concrete and he stepped on his balls too for good measure. Are we

130
00:15:07,299 --> 00:15:12,539
going to get a pin on the outside? Where are they taking this? Just two extremely

131
00:15:12,539 --> 00:15:18,620
tall... Uh-oh. Pinwheel is going underneath the... And he's got a pull cue. No, he

132
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:22,779
doesn't want it. I don't want that. He didn't. Oh! Big mistake. A capitalization

133
00:15:22,779 --> 00:15:28,179
from Jerma. The slap. Is he gonna go into the... No, it's a reversal. Back down. I'm

134
00:15:28,179 --> 00:15:32,259
not sure why he picked up that pull cue there. He's not going to use it. I think

135
00:15:32,259 --> 00:15:35,700
he... I don't think he wants to cheat. I think he wants to beat Jerma fair and

136
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:40,500
square. I'm like, uh-oh. I think Jerma might be dead. Jerma's face just

137
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:44,259
erupted. The red marker means you're in trouble. Is Jerma going to tap out

138
00:15:44,259 --> 00:15:46,659
here? No, no, no, no. He's not going to tap out. He's not going to tap

139
00:15:46,659 --> 00:15:50,519
out. Jerma's got more perseverance than this. Good reversal there by Jerma.

140
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:54,490
As the referee is standing there awkwardly just trying to figure out

141
00:15:55,289 --> 00:15:58,649
what to do about this whole thing. And they're going up the alley. He

142
00:15:59,049 --> 00:16:03,610
Jerma gets thrown into the entrance way. I think he might have a headache

143
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:06,889
trying to get back in. Both going at the same time. The pull cue is still on

144
00:16:06,889 --> 00:16:12,549
the ground. Nice DDT. Perfectly executed. And Jerma is bleeding from the

145
00:16:12,549 --> 00:16:17,610
head. Did Jerma get... He didn't... What happened? Oh, right into the

146
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:22,600
concrete. That's right. Oh! Two closed lines. Three closed lines. Will

147
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,679
it be enough? Is he going to go for a pin potentially here? Now he's

148
00:16:24,679 --> 00:16:30,019
going to pick him up and punch him in the face. Does Jerma know any

149
00:16:30,019 --> 00:16:36,200
other moves? A reverse su... Oh, that was a reverse suplex. Could that

150
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:43,139
be it? Is that going to be it? I think. One, two, three. That's it.

151
00:16:43,139 --> 00:16:48,309
Jerma beats Pinwheel first try. He got him with the reverse suplex.

152
00:16:48,309 --> 00:16:56,200
And everybody's booing and they can boo all they want. It's proven.

153
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:59,960
That's it. No more of this bullshit. I beat Pinwheel on stream first

154
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:07,779
try. Look at all these awesome moves that I did. I was surprised

155
00:17:07,779 --> 00:17:12,579
that the double stump diaper trash did not seal the deal there for.

156
00:17:12,579 --> 00:17:19,670
We did have a nice move by Pinwheel here. It was a DDT. People in the

157
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:22,470
audience right now, in the arena, are screaming right now.

158
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:27,430
Oh, hold on. Jerma's got something to say. Yeah, see? First try. He's

159
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:36,059
holding up the one finger. First try. I'm as angry as he is. He's

160
00:17:36,059 --> 00:17:39,579
taunting Twitch chat right now, saying, yeah, like, look what I did.

161
00:17:39,579 --> 00:17:47,980
By the way, that's an actual picture of my face, just in case

162
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:54,740
anyone was wondering. Moving on to the next match.

163
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:57,859
We've got... This is going to be a fan favorite one here.

164
00:17:57,859 --> 00:18:08,599
After Jerma very, very clearly beats Pinwheel first try.

165
00:18:08,599 --> 00:18:14,170
Pre-recorded and rigged. No, we're watching it live.

166
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:17,529
Hey, scream over the... Hold on. There we go. I can just do that.

167
00:18:17,529 --> 00:18:21,450
I wouldn't have to worry about the VOD getting deleted. But the next one

168
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:25,460
coming up is going to be quite an interesting match.

169
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:32,299
It is a six-man ladder match. Six people in the ring

170
00:18:32,299 --> 00:18:36,140
have to climb up to the top and grab the briefcase. Six people.

171
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:49,799
I wonder who's going to win this one. Oh, it's still loading. This has got

172
00:18:49,880 --> 00:19:01,910
a lot of people are in this one. Well, might as well bring it up here.

173
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:05,430
We've had a short little intermission. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the

174
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:13,529
six-man, six-man ladder match. The six participants

175
00:19:13,529 --> 00:19:17,210
are a lot of people that you guys know.

176
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:20,970
There's the money in the bank. It's two twenty dollar bills.

177
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:23,369
I said there's like a hundred grand in there, but I lied. And there's

178
00:19:23,369 --> 00:19:29,430
Chuck Schnauzwell. Contestant number one in the

179
00:19:29,509 --> 00:19:38,660
money in the bank six-man. Grab the briefcase challenge.

180
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:43,539
Chuck Schnauzwell, one of the murderers of the Sims murder house.

181
00:19:43,539 --> 00:19:47,990
And you probably could guess who the other five contestants are.

182
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:55,349
Maybe you can't. Everybody loves Chuck. The Schnauz,

183
00:19:55,349 --> 00:20:01,140
as they call him in the locker room, because he's got really great teeth.

184
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:11,450
That's what they say. Oh, Twitch chat really seems to like that.

185
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:14,970
I wonder... Oh, hold on a minute. Who's the next contestant in the six-man

186
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:20,299
ladder match? Six-man? Why don't you add six-woman?

187
00:20:20,299 --> 00:20:28,700
That's D56TFO98, one of the other members of the Sims murder house.

188
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:38,599
D56, very adamant on coming in here and winning.

189
00:20:38,599 --> 00:20:44,519
Landed on this planet ten years ago. Nice slide.

190
00:20:44,519 --> 00:20:48,599
You can't practice that five times. D56 trying to show off to the crowd,

191
00:20:48,599 --> 00:20:57,779
get some people to back her endeavor here.

192
00:20:57,779 --> 00:21:01,509
You gotta let them have at least a few minutes in the ring, you know what I mean?

193
00:21:01,509 --> 00:21:07,349
You can't skip their beloved entrance. Contestant number three

194
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:12,579
coming in here. No, no, she's got more to say. No,

195
00:21:12,579 --> 00:21:16,099
I can't really hear what she's saying, because she's not mic'd up.

196
00:21:16,099 --> 00:21:19,059
But anyways, here comes the third contestant in the...

197
00:21:19,059 --> 00:21:28,619
and getting booed here. There are loud boos coming in for Frufru.

198
00:21:28,619 --> 00:21:34,089
If you could... If you could guess...

199
00:21:34,089 --> 00:21:38,740
Yeah, this is... This is... They're all here.

200
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:43,690
Frufru, one of the worst people in the whole house.

201
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:49,740
Nobody liked him. I don't like him. And people ironically like him, but he sucks.

202
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:57,779
I hope he doesn't win. I'm glad he's getting booed.

203
00:21:57,779 --> 00:22:00,900
Nice anime stance. He's a big fan of anime. That's what he says, but that's

204
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:11,500
what they say in the locker room. You know, because of his hat.

205
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:15,299
I like him. I like him. Well, that's fine.

206
00:22:15,299 --> 00:22:22,839
He's ready. Contestant number four. Let's see who it is.

207
00:22:22,839 --> 00:22:31,380
That's Gavrett. Gavrett from the murder house.

208
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:34,730
Just kind of a regular guy with a weirdly shaped head.

209
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:42,200
There wasn't really anything crazy about him. He's practicing his

210
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:45,980
Sims dance, because they are Sims, right? That is very

211
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:50,619
important for you to realize. They've been computer-generated scanned

212
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:57,269
into the into the German wrestling universe.

213
00:22:57,269 --> 00:23:00,069
You think you'd have any other moves besides put your fists out back and

214
00:23:00,069 --> 00:23:06,470
forth. Get him the fuck out of here.

215
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:11,480
Okay. Oh, by the way, that t-shirt took like

216
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:15,559
an hour and 40 minutes to make. So let's just be real about that.

217
00:23:15,559 --> 00:23:25,079
That's not in the game. Coming up next, number five.

218
00:23:25,079 --> 00:23:31,380
After Gavrett. I really hope that people are prepared for this one.

219
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:37,240
That's Adam Sandler. He's coming out doing his patented

220
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,609
comedy.

221
00:23:44,819 --> 00:23:49,109
He's known for that. One of the most talented comedians of our

222
00:23:49,109 --> 00:23:56,759
of our generation. Probably 10 generations.

223
00:23:56,759 --> 00:24:06,220
Such comedic routines as Baby Noise does the same weird voice

224
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:11,190
and thinks they're way funnier than they are.

225
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:15,319
And no, I'm not describing me. I mean, I am. But

226
00:24:15,319 --> 00:24:20,470
I mean, look, he's a fucking funny guy, okay?

227
00:24:20,549 --> 00:24:27,190
He's really talented. He's really funny. And this commentator's coming to a very

228
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:30,069
strong realization in the right in the middle of it.

229
00:24:30,069 --> 00:24:32,950
Don't matter. Somebody said that before, didn't they? It doesn't matter. Here

230
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:35,829
comes Wally Wheat. Wally Wheat's the real contestant and he's gonna wipe

231
00:24:35,829 --> 00:24:41,420
the floor with all these motherfuckers in the ring.

232
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:50,500
Here are your six. The Sims Rumble. The Sims Murderhouse ladder match.

233
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:53,779
These people in this ring right now, all of them

234
00:24:53,779 --> 00:24:58,359
are insane. They will kill. They will kill.

235
00:24:58,359 --> 00:25:03,930
They have no problem with it. Half of them are not even from this planet.

236
00:25:03,930 --> 00:25:12,549
Dangerous people. Incredibly dangerous people. What do you say you ring that

237
00:25:12,549 --> 00:25:14,950
bell? Six man ladder match, ladies and

238
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:19,269
gentlemen. The Sims Murderhouse. Chuck wasting no time. He's going outside to

239
00:25:19,269 --> 00:25:21,829
go to the ladder. Adam Sandler now with a reversal on

240
00:25:21,829 --> 00:25:25,990
D56. Chuck does not want this to last long.

241
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:29,029
He's got the ladder all ready. It hadn't even been 10 seconds. While

242
00:25:29,029 --> 00:25:31,829
Frufru is gonna see if he can make that

243
00:25:31,829 --> 00:25:36,059
a different story. We'll head to the apron outside the ring for Chuck.

244
00:25:36,059 --> 00:25:39,500
Adam Sandler now with the offensive. There are no teams here. Keep that in

245
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:43,240
mind. Nobody is on any team. Whoever gets to

246
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:48,119
the top of that ladder first wins. Now Adam Sandler doing his

247
00:25:48,119 --> 00:25:52,200
patented funny noise. Let me see if I can top him. Let me

248
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:55,240
see if I can top him. Hey it's me. It's me. It's me. It's me.

249
00:25:55,240 --> 00:26:03,480
We're not so different, you and I, Adam.

250
00:26:03,559 --> 00:26:09,720
Adam Sandler goes over the top ropes and now they're outside. While D56

251
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:16,039
is got Adam Sandler smashing his head into

252
00:26:16,039 --> 00:26:20,519
the steps. Well Garrett. What's something we didn't know about

253
00:26:20,519 --> 00:26:24,119
Garrett? He seems to be a pretty talented submission artist.

254
00:26:24,119 --> 00:26:28,359
While Frufru is on the outside trying to get his composure.

255
00:26:28,359 --> 00:26:32,309
No one has touched the ladder or anything else for that matter.

256
00:26:32,309 --> 00:26:35,109
Well speaking of the devil here, Wally Wheat's got the ladder

257
00:26:35,109 --> 00:26:38,470
going over to Garrett. No, Garrett's gonna rip it out of his hands.

258
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:41,190
No, I don't know what the deal is with that. Why do they put it down? You have

259
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:45,990
a weapon. You're a bloodthirsty murderer. Use it.

260
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:53,190
What a wonderful bulldog by DF 5694. Whatever your name is.

261
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:55,509
You're not supposed to be able to understand it. It's not even English.

262
00:26:55,509 --> 00:26:59,819
It's like a weird alien. It's a weird alien dialect. Garrett

263
00:26:59,819 --> 00:27:06,519
with oh what a reversal by D56 and a scoop slam coming up. No,

264
00:27:06,519 --> 00:27:13,400
is D56 gonna dump him over the rails? No. She holds back. She does hold back.

265
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:17,880
As Wally Wheat now in the corner. Chuck Schnoswell. It seems that they've all

266
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:23,529
been training vigorously. Oh what a pose by Frufru.

267
00:27:23,529 --> 00:27:26,490
That's the, you gotta, you have to get him out of the ring. You know what I'm

268
00:27:26,490 --> 00:27:28,809
saying? There's six people. No one's ever

269
00:27:28,809 --> 00:27:31,049
gonna climb to the top of this thing. You gotta throw above the top.

270
00:27:31,049 --> 00:27:34,950
You gotta go get a weapon. Go grab like a grenade or something.

271
00:27:36,039 --> 00:27:41,180
As now we've got three in the ring. This could end very quickly. Garrett thought

272
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:42,859
about it for a second. Now I'm gonna get the ladder.

273
00:27:42,859 --> 00:27:46,980
Garrett's got the ladder. No. I don't want that. I think I'd rather

274
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:49,700
pick this guy up like a backpack. Oh it was, that's the backpack.

275
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:54,309
That's Garrett's special move. I can't believe we just saw that. That's the

276
00:27:54,309 --> 00:27:57,109
backpack. Adam Sandlin now coming in with a

277
00:27:57,109 --> 00:28:01,220
couple of punches. What a reversal by Garrett.

278
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:05,609
Garrett is on fire here. If I'm gonna make a bet here I'm gonna say

279
00:28:05,609 --> 00:28:08,650
Garrett's gonna be the one to take the money in that briefcase and win the

280
00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:13,079
murder house brawl as we're gonna call it. What a

281
00:28:13,079 --> 00:28:16,200
fireman's carry knee smash to the spinal column. That's the name of her move.

282
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:21,130
That's her special move. That's her special move. As D56 is

283
00:28:21,130 --> 00:28:26,460
gonna grab. No and finally we get to see the ladder used.

284
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:30,859
D56 is going pretty much all in on Adam Sandlin.

285
00:28:30,859 --> 00:28:34,380
Oh it gets taken and nobody's really trying to do anything with the

286
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:38,859
ladder besides small pushes to somebody's face. We

287
00:28:38,859 --> 00:28:44,279
could see blood here. D56 now trying to work that bad

288
00:28:44,319 --> 00:28:49,180
knee on Chuck Schnoswell. Because his nose is so large other

289
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:53,140
parts of his body are weaker. He's got bad knees, bad

290
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:55,930
elbows, but he could have real strong fucking nose.

291
00:28:55,930 --> 00:29:00,660
Garrett now has got the ladder. It didn't even phase her at first.

292
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:04,380
That was a little odd. Dropping the ladder again. Garrett's

293
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:06,819
going for Chuck Schnoswell into the corner.

294
00:29:06,819 --> 00:29:10,180
He's facing the ground. Oh what an elbow to stop that. No another

295
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:15,099
reversal. They all trained in the same dojo by the way.

296
00:29:15,099 --> 00:29:19,190
For what I'm being told on my desk here. When they first got there.

297
00:29:19,829 --> 00:29:24,059
She throws it over the top ropes. Essentially handing it

298
00:29:24,059 --> 00:29:27,740
to somebody on the outside. Adam Sandler contemplating his next movie script.

299
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:30,539
Will it involve a giant pac-man? I'm not sure but it's going to involve a

300
00:29:30,539 --> 00:29:33,339
broken neck. Nice reverse back neck breaker by

301
00:29:33,339 --> 00:29:37,299
Adam Sandlin. And a Russian leg sweep here too.

302
00:29:37,299 --> 00:29:41,480
We've got a problem here though. Chuck Schnoswell on the top with

303
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:45,900
D56. It's going to be a superplex. Off the top turnbuckle.

304
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:56,619
Oh that's a broken alien spine. She is out. She's out cold. Maybe not.

305
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:00,599
But what I was gonna say is they'd all trained in the same dojo from what I

306
00:30:00,599 --> 00:30:05,140
what I got on my paper here. And weirdly enough they were thrown out

307
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:08,740
of every dojo besides they ended up going to some back alley dojo.

308
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:13,259
They're not even that's not even uh sanctioned it's not even uh you know

309
00:30:13,259 --> 00:30:17,589
it's not there's no it's not like unionized there's no

310
00:30:17,589 --> 00:30:19,990
it's it's just like it was an alleyway that they were allowed in because

311
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:24,069
they kept bringing uh glass tubes they're bringing knives into the

312
00:30:24,069 --> 00:30:26,150
other dojos to try to fight each other and they were just like throwing

313
00:30:26,150 --> 00:30:30,819
the fuck out. People were saying you can't bring those in here.

314
00:30:30,819 --> 00:30:39,750
So they ended up getting trained by an unnamed uh sensei and uh they're the

315
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:44,569
sensei question mark and I'm not it's it's it's it's actually the word

316
00:30:44,569 --> 00:30:47,240
question space mark. That's the person's name.

317
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:51,099
So and wait Garrett's going up there just barely. Everyone just kind of

318
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:53,579
stopped doing something for a minute here. No no no no no. Garrett's gonna

319
00:30:53,579 --> 00:30:56,710
get that. Is he gonna get that money? Did

320
00:30:56,710 --> 00:31:02,730
Garrett just sneakily no he stopped it. Garrett almost just sneakily got

321
00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:09,160
up there and picked up that entire that was insane.

322
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:12,119
I can't believe they just almost let that happen and now Chuck has got the

323
00:31:12,119 --> 00:31:16,059
ladder. We are seeing fatigue settle in right

324
00:31:16,059 --> 00:31:22,009
now as Chuck is going to try to get the

325
00:31:22,009 --> 00:31:26,089
ring cleared. There goes D56. Chuck Schnoswell

326
00:31:26,089 --> 00:31:30,299
is going up there. Will it be enough? Molly Wheat is

327
00:31:30,299 --> 00:31:34,460
out cold. Chuck Schnoswell's got the briefcase. Is he gonna

328
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:37,910
oh they're gonna help they're gonna work together. Oh just hit Adam Sandler

329
00:31:37,910 --> 00:31:41,720
in the face. I can't believe they actually work

330
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:46,019
together. Oh not for long not anymore.

331
00:31:46,019 --> 00:31:52,259
Oh and the alliances stop right there. Molly Wheat is getting

332
00:31:52,259 --> 00:31:56,519
killed by the ladder. Garrett now is gonna make another attempt here.

333
00:31:56,519 --> 00:32:00,019
Is he gonna be able to get up there? This could be it.

334
00:32:00,019 --> 00:32:04,259
Garrett's gonna chase what a punch to Adam Sandler's face.

335
00:32:04,259 --> 00:32:07,539
Come on D56 you gotta get up there. Garrett's gonna get it.

336
00:32:07,539 --> 00:32:14,460
Garrett's gonna get it. No is this gonna be it?

337
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:17,900
Garrett is on the edge. They're both on the edge. Garrett just fell off.

338
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:25,589
Molly Wheat now can D56 can she make the attempt? Uh oh he

339
00:32:25,589 --> 00:32:39,589
no she why did she step down? Why did she step down off the ladder?

340
00:32:39,589 --> 00:32:46,809
Anyway oh and now we've got a forward object in the middle of the ring here.

341
00:32:46,809 --> 00:32:52,650
Frufru is now going absolute ham on the back of D56 with that big piece

342
00:32:52,650 --> 00:32:55,690
of steel. Adam Sandler just keeps finding his way outside

343
00:32:55,690 --> 00:33:02,299
and getting hurt outside. Oh what a clobber into the forehead

344
00:33:02,299 --> 00:33:07,289
that at least 30 pounds of steel not even gonna set it up he's just

345
00:33:07,289 --> 00:33:12,170
doing no it's gonna get reversed again. Reversed again doesn't want the

346
00:33:12,170 --> 00:33:14,900
ladder does want the ladder who knows what the fuck they're

347
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:19,930
doing. Just a little tap to make sure that

348
00:33:19,930 --> 00:33:36,180
she wouldn't get it again. Oh what the fuck was that?

349
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:41,059
Molly Wheat now sees an opportunity after Frufru just broke.

350
00:33:41,059 --> 00:33:44,819
Garrett's back with his knees. Is this ever gonna end?

351
00:33:44,819 --> 00:33:48,420
Is there ever gonna be an opportunity for one of these psychos to put this

352
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:51,859
shit up and go grab that money? Adam Sandler now in the ring for the

353
00:33:51,859 --> 00:33:58,089
first time in probably five minutes. Nice snap neck breaker there setting

354
00:33:58,089 --> 00:34:01,130
him up for it. Look at the exhaustion everybody's so

355
00:34:01,130 --> 00:34:03,210
tired I don't think no one's gonna be able to climb to the top of

356
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:08,489
this thing. Garrett's been really consistently the only one that's

357
00:34:08,489 --> 00:34:17,139
carried and he currently still has the ladder.

358
00:34:17,139 --> 00:34:29,619
Adam Sandler's got Chuck Schnosswell. What a Chuck's play.

359
00:34:29,619 --> 00:34:33,139
He tried to do it again he tried to do it to something else.

360
00:34:33,139 --> 00:34:37,559
He tried to do two in a row but he couldn't get it he missed with the

361
00:34:37,559 --> 00:34:40,280
other one. That's Garrett now these two have done

362
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:46,119
this over and over and over again back and forth trading the ladder.

363
00:34:46,119 --> 00:34:52,519
What a somersault heel kick by Garrett.

364
00:34:52,519 --> 00:34:56,519
Garrett now what a leg drop there the ladder is finally set up and Garrett

365
00:34:56,519 --> 00:34:58,760
has a beautiful sneaky opportunity. You're

366
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:01,400
gonna get the briefcase he's got two of his hands on it.

367
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:05,159
Can he unclip it? I think he might be able to get it. D56 now

368
00:35:05,159 --> 00:35:09,480
is barely no barely just stopping it. Is D56 gonna be taking a capital

369
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:14,980
decision here? This is it. This is gonna be it.

370
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:20,739
D56 has almost got it. Frufru it sees an opportunity to push it over.

371
00:35:20,739 --> 00:35:30,460
No and she's still holding on. That's gotta be it. That's gotta be it.

372
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:35,820
That's it. Frufru just has to climb up and grab it. He is completely

373
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:39,739
he's got a free no traffic he's no lane.

374
00:35:39,739 --> 00:35:42,860
Uh-oh Chuck is seeing they're both seeing it now.

375
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:45,739
But was it too late they were too busy fighting each other. What is Wally

376
00:35:45,739 --> 00:35:50,440
Wheat doing? Why would you do that? Why would you just what? She can't push it.

377
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:58,139
No he wins. She couldn't push it. She didn't she ran out of strength.

378
00:35:58,139 --> 00:36:03,340
Frufru is your winner of the sims murder house

379
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:14,179
ladder match. The fucking worst character just won.

380
00:36:14,179 --> 00:36:20,019
Why would she click that of all the things?

381
00:36:20,019 --> 00:36:23,380
That guys don't worry this this thing fucking snakes in there. He's

382
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:25,460
gonna open that and his life is gonna end.

383
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:32,039
So don't worry. Wally fucked it up. No I just

384
00:36:32,039 --> 00:36:37,690
ran out of gas. D56 got up trying to push the ladder over and just

385
00:36:37,690 --> 00:36:51,099
didn't have enough strength. The Sandler chokeslam.

386
00:36:51,099 --> 00:36:59,449
Oh that's fucking great. Can I edit people's chances to win a match?

387
00:36:59,449 --> 00:37:03,880
I think I can but I know I don't they gotta earn it man.

388
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:08,860
I don't give I don't hand anybody victories here. You you gotta earn it.

389
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:12,380
I'm not gonna predetermine who wins. It's uh that whoever wins

390
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:19,530
they get in there and they fucking fight. If you thought okay if you guys

391
00:37:19,530 --> 00:37:22,809
thought I could rig these matches why the fuck would I have this guy

392
00:37:22,809 --> 00:37:31,780
win? Why the fuck would I do that? Hey I got an idea. Let me have like

393
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:37,289
the shittiest character win. We got a table match coming up here.

394
00:37:37,289 --> 00:37:43,460
This is a 2v2 table match.

395
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:49,460
Tag match. Oh whoops I forgot I have to mute the audio.

396
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:59,900
Sorry about that. We are going back to a different era here

397
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:04,630
on the channel. By era I mean different

398
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:21,340
console generation. Different console generation than you're used to.

399
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:27,110
Oh fuck I asked back there. Yeah because some could say that we are

400
00:38:27,110 --> 00:38:32,340
going back a few generations. Some could say.

401
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:43,219
Let's go and get it started. 2v2 table match.

402
00:38:43,219 --> 00:38:50,300
Let's see who it is. Hailing all the way from Monster Rancher.

403
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:53,500
That's right ladies and gentlemen that's Beanbag Sonic.

404
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:57,690
Are we gonna get to see it? Are we gonna get to see it? There it is.

405
00:38:57,690 --> 00:39:06,760
Beanbag Sonic making his first appearance ever in the rubble.

406
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:18,329
Top seed. Yep and Beanbag Sonic's partner.

407
00:39:18,329 --> 00:39:26,219
Beanbag Sonic's partner. Are we gonna get to see another dab?

408
00:39:26,219 --> 00:39:38,420
Oh that was a nice move. Is it the mosquito? It's not the mosquito.

409
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:45,139
It's somebody else. Somebody equally as important in the Monster Rancher

410
00:39:45,139 --> 00:39:50,010
streams and the PlayStation 1 streams in general. Beanbag Sonic's

411
00:39:50,010 --> 00:40:08,650
partner for the table match is Sweet Rhind.

412
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:14,679
Rewind to the Rhind. Ladies and gentlemen there is Sweet Rhind. Beanbag

413
00:40:14,679 --> 00:40:25,139
Sonic is Sweet Rhind. Uh he is fucking huge.

414
00:40:25,139 --> 00:40:33,460
Well they're very large. They're monsters. He's a giant wall. What do

415
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:38,730
you expect? And their opponents. From point blank.

416
00:40:38,730 --> 00:40:44,170
That's Dr. Dawn. Can you guess who his

417
00:40:44,170 --> 00:41:00,539
teammate will be? Who? That's Dr. Dawn from point blank.

418
00:41:00,539 --> 00:41:05,369
You guys don't know who this is? Well then you're not gonna know his partner

419
00:41:05,369 --> 00:41:13,829
Dr. Dan. Wait did nobody watch those streams?

420
00:41:13,829 --> 00:41:25,659
I streamed that like four times. No wait no yeah yeah you did.

421
00:41:25,659 --> 00:41:36,360
Yeah you guys were there for those streams. Did what did those streams

422
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:39,079
have low viewers? Well some of you guys know who

423
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:49,500
Dr. Dawn and Dr. Dan is. It's not a clone. That's not a clone.

424
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:56,539
That's a different person. That's not a copy and paste. Go look

425
00:41:56,539 --> 00:42:07,510
him up. Dr. Dawn and Dr. Dan. I hope they fucking win. I hope they

426
00:42:07,510 --> 00:42:21,579
fucking win. I hope they destroy these two.

427
00:42:21,579 --> 00:42:25,019
Beanbag Sonic and Sweet Rhind versus Dr. Dawn and Dr. Dan. PlayStation 1

428
00:42:25,019 --> 00:42:34,199
battle. And it is a table match.

429
00:42:36,949 --> 00:42:40,389
Dr. Dawn is is getting a table immediately. And Sweet Rhind

430
00:42:40,389 --> 00:42:45,000
has got a table. The match has just begun. Beanbag Sonic.

431
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,119
Two tables are inside of the ring right now. Sweet Rhind is

432
00:42:48,119 --> 00:42:52,570
huge. Sweet Rhind is too big. How do I edit this

433
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:56,250
in the middle of the stream and make him like 30% smaller? Dr. Dawn with a

434
00:42:56,250 --> 00:43:02,539
with a nice spinning heel kick. Beanbag Sonic using his upper body

435
00:43:02,539 --> 00:43:06,920
strength on Dr. Dan. I may have mixed the two of them up.

436
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:12,980
No clones by the way. Oh what a delicious right-handed punch

437
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:16,519
into the face of the world. Does Sweet Rhind have a face?

438
00:43:16,519 --> 00:43:21,449
I can't even tell. I don't know. Does Sweet Rhind have a head?

439
00:43:21,449 --> 00:43:24,570
DDT. They're a big fan of that. Wait now we got. Hold on. There's a problem here

440
00:43:24,570 --> 00:43:26,969
though. Dr. Dawn and Dr. Dan are both in the

441
00:43:26,969 --> 00:43:31,980
ring. Beanbag Sonic is outside in pain.

442
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:37,539
All it takes is one of those tables to get set up and this could be over.

443
00:43:37,539 --> 00:43:40,820
Yeah. Dr. Dawn and Dr. Dan. They're not clones. Dr. Dan has

444
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:44,820
three inches of reach. A larger head. Oh right under the table

445
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:47,460
which is probably a better surface to land on.

446
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:51,820
Are we gonna see the Sweet Rhind's special move? I'm not sure. I did make

447
00:43:51,820 --> 00:43:56,940
sure to put it in. I wonder if we'll see it. All right. I

448
00:43:56,940 --> 00:44:00,219
can't tell who did the move there. What a

449
00:44:00,219 --> 00:44:06,659
jumping scissor kick to Beanbag Sonic's stomach. Everybody talked all the shit

450
00:44:06,659 --> 00:44:08,820
about Dr. Dawn and Dr. Dan but they are

451
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:15,159
some of the top competitors we've seen in probably three years.

452
00:44:15,159 --> 00:44:18,119
They weren't allowed to bring their guns. He accidentally just hurt his

453
00:44:18,119 --> 00:44:22,460
partner there. I don't know how. They're I would

454
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:26,940
say at this point it's a 70-30 with Dr. Dawn and Dr. Dan. Dr.

455
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:31,500
Dawn you just fucked up. What? What? You blew everything. You

456
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:34,539
absolutely blew it. Sweet Rhind that's like a four thousand pound

457
00:44:34,539 --> 00:44:38,860
hunk of concrete on the top rope right now. Waiting for Dr. Dawn to get up.

458
00:44:38,860 --> 00:44:42,380
While Dr. Dan has Beanbag Sonic up in a fireman's carry.

459
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:50,119
Beautifully executed. Well still waiting. Didn't even affect him.

460
00:44:50,119 --> 00:44:53,320
He just got him with the tip of his toes. He just scratched under his

461
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:56,869
mustache with that kick. He waited so long to time that too

462
00:44:56,869 --> 00:44:58,869
but they're not known for their agility.

463
00:44:58,869 --> 00:45:02,389
A wall type monster rancher. Monsters are very

464
00:45:02,389 --> 00:45:07,590
they're not they're known for strength not for finesse. Just going

465
00:45:07,590 --> 00:45:13,349
onto the back of Sweet Rhind. Dr. Dan now

466
00:45:13,349 --> 00:45:18,489
uh sorry there is a blockage in the way. I don't know what happened.

467
00:45:18,489 --> 00:45:22,489
You have a giant person standing in front of the camera.

468
00:45:22,489 --> 00:45:26,340
Uh-oh it has the momentum shifted here with Beanbag Sonic and Dr. Dawn

469
00:45:26,340 --> 00:45:29,989
and Dr. Dan. No just when you thought it could have

470
00:45:29,989 --> 00:45:33,369
changed. The reversals here seems to be the

471
00:45:33,449 --> 00:45:37,320
reversal king is Dr. Dawn. I've probably said their names

472
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:42,519
backwards five times. They just dropped him on his head.

473
00:45:42,519 --> 00:45:47,719
He just picked him up and just dropped him on his head. Beanbag Sonic

474
00:45:47,719 --> 00:45:51,739
just absolutely oh he was going for a dab there. Never taunt in the middle of

475
00:45:51,739 --> 00:45:53,340
a match. He was going for a dab and he got

476
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:59,900
caught by Dr. Dan. Dr. Dawn and Dr. Dan now double teaming Sonic.

477
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:06,889
Caught him right in the back. Oh I'm not sure Dr. Dan's getting up

478
00:46:06,889 --> 00:46:12,389
from that one. Throwing the table outside for some

479
00:46:12,389 --> 00:46:17,130
strange reason. Sweet Ry now I have really no idea what they're

480
00:46:17,130 --> 00:46:20,489
doing. It's the first person to go through a table that

481
00:46:20,489 --> 00:46:24,900
their team loses. He's wrapping up both of his arms now.

482
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:30,389
Throwing him behind a German suplex with his arms tied behind his back.

483
00:46:30,389 --> 00:46:34,550
The AI is his AI is really dumb. He's desperately trying to figure out

484
00:46:34,550 --> 00:46:39,460
how to pick up the table. He got confused there. They must

485
00:46:39,460 --> 00:46:43,659
what the hell was that? No don't don't don't set it up and then get

486
00:46:43,659 --> 00:46:47,820
thrown through it Beanbag. This could be it. He doesn't move

487
00:46:47,820 --> 00:46:49,820
through this table. This is it. This game over.

488
00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:56,900
Beanbag Sonic. This is it. That's it. Powerbomb through the table.

489
00:46:56,900 --> 00:47:06,760
Beanbag Sonic and Sweet Ry are your winners. Unbelievable super kick. That was

490
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:14,739
intense. That's what set it all up. And here's the finisher here. He just

491
00:47:14,739 --> 00:47:20,889
throws him through the table into the corner. I think he may have

492
00:47:20,889 --> 00:47:24,980
gotten injured there himself. It's all right. We're gonna give you

493
00:47:24,980 --> 00:47:28,420
meat tonight. Well I'm gonna give I'll give a potato to Sweet Ry.

494
00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:34,119
But he's getting meat and he's getting candy. There they are.

495
00:47:34,119 --> 00:47:40,619
Two best friends from one of the best PlayStation 1 games ever.

496
00:47:40,619 --> 00:47:44,659
Dr. Don and Dr. Dan thank you for participating.

497
00:47:44,659 --> 00:47:51,579
But it's time for you to go home because you two are not in the rumble.

498
00:47:51,579 --> 00:48:01,000
Go home. That was a fucking bismuth. You just got you just got

499
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:10,119
shit canned on the air. But anyways Beanbag Sonic and Sweet Ry are the

500
00:48:10,119 --> 00:48:14,070
winners. Getting ever so closer to the main event here.

501
00:48:14,070 --> 00:48:23,610
How many matches did I miss? This is the third one.

502
00:48:23,610 --> 00:48:29,159
Or is it another way? This is yeah. So you got you got two more.

503
00:48:29,159 --> 00:48:31,639
You get the next match and then you get the rumble. The rumble is going to be

504
00:48:31,639 --> 00:48:38,570
like probably 30 or 40 minutes. Three fixed matches? I didn't fix anything.

505
00:48:38,570 --> 00:48:43,400
I wanted Dr. Don and Dr. Dan to win. All right let's go. The next one.

506
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:52,940
What was the first one? The first one was the me versus pinwheel.

507
00:48:52,940 --> 00:48:57,610
And I made it I made it look really easy. Second match was a

508
00:48:57,610 --> 00:49:01,690
six-man ladder between the Sims murder house. Dr. Don and Dr. Dan

509
00:49:01,690 --> 00:49:04,889
versus Sweet Ry and Beanbag Sonic. And then you got this one a

510
00:49:04,889 --> 00:49:12,139
backstage brawl. Oh no okay I know I know what this is.

511
00:49:12,139 --> 00:49:15,739
They make a lot of money. So I kind of let them

512
00:49:15,739 --> 00:49:19,460
use the space here at the German arena. So

513
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:22,420
it's okay though. I don't think this will take very long.

514
00:49:22,420 --> 00:49:34,219
So yeah this won't take very long. They're filming a YouTube video.

515
00:49:34,219 --> 00:49:37,260
Oh that's Gary the fuck up and Bill crazy. I let them. Were they

516
00:49:37,260 --> 00:49:39,980
supposed to come out? Yeah they're making like a hardcore

517
00:49:40,059 --> 00:49:49,460
like we're fucked up YouTube video. Okay yeah oh so that's Gary the fuck up.

518
00:49:49,460 --> 00:49:51,780
That's the cameraman. I'm not sure what they're doing back here though. I just

519
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:57,909
I let them use the space. They make like 30 million dollars a

520
00:49:57,909 --> 00:50:03,719
year guys. I'm one of the most subscribed YouTube channels.

521
00:50:03,719 --> 00:50:08,380
Now it's something I heard. I've been wondering about the feet there.

522
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:13,739
Apparently for a top YouTube dares thing that he did a long time ago.

523
00:50:13,739 --> 00:50:17,610
He had his feet severed and had bird feet put on

524
00:50:17,610 --> 00:50:22,309
surgically. I guess that he he's kind of fucked up. He's kind of a

525
00:50:22,309 --> 00:50:31,030
fucked up guy. I dropped the camera. They're filming.

526
00:50:31,030 --> 00:50:37,050
Oh that might look nice on the on the YouTube channel.

527
00:50:37,050 --> 00:50:41,900
Oh that was insane. Wow he just jumped into the wall.

528
00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:47,769
Smashing his face on the ground. These guys are fucked.

529
00:50:47,769 --> 00:50:52,659
What else are they going to do for the video? Oh right into that. His

530
00:50:52,659 --> 00:50:54,980
head just hit the top of that amp there.

531
00:50:54,980 --> 00:51:02,679
What are they going to do again? Okay I took like a 60 or 70 thousand dollar

532
00:51:02,679 --> 00:51:14,869
commission for this. Under the wall pool. No this is just

533
00:51:14,869 --> 00:51:20,059
what they do. They jump into pools with fucking

534
00:51:20,059 --> 00:51:25,380
like blood pools. They they shoot baseballs at each other out of a

535
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:28,940
pitching machine. I think number three or four most

536
00:51:28,940 --> 00:51:36,969
subscribed like I said. I'm not sure like how this is gonna

537
00:51:36,969 --> 00:51:40,730
Oh they fucked that one up. They'll take care of that in editing.

538
00:51:40,730 --> 00:51:54,360
They'll edit that one out. Oh he's setting up the shot. He's setting up a

539
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:59,670
really good camera angle here. Oh right in the balls. Dude they just

540
00:51:59,670 --> 00:52:12,539
got a ball shot. I can't wait to see that in a compilation.

541
00:52:12,539 --> 00:52:33,559
He can't get dirt on him. Oh no that might be the last video he

542
00:52:33,559 --> 00:52:44,739
has ever made. He can't just like stop at somebody's

543
00:52:44,739 --> 00:52:53,800
head. He survived way worse. That's it.

544
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:57,159
You've been like you've jumped off a building before man.

545
00:52:57,159 --> 00:53:04,300
You've been electrocuted. You can't like your head stepped on you die.

546
00:53:04,300 --> 00:53:16,409
Oh I almost want to do it again because that's so

547
00:53:16,409 --> 00:53:21,079
there's so many ways for them to do fuck them shit back here.

548
00:53:21,079 --> 00:53:25,159
They can I may I checked a bunch of boxes for them to like fucking like

549
00:53:25,159 --> 00:53:27,880
kill each other back here and you step on his head and that's it he's

550
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:36,300
dead. Oh no I can't. I can't. I can't do it.

551
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:47,349
I can't do a rematch. That ends this whole thing.

552
00:53:47,349 --> 00:53:53,369
But I kind of can't do a rematch. You know what I mean?

553
00:53:53,369 --> 00:53:57,690
We can do a rematch after. We'll do like an encore presentation.

554
00:53:57,690 --> 00:54:04,119
He's still. All right that concludes that. Hopefully that

555
00:54:04,119 --> 00:54:06,760
upload is good and it gets 50 million views and

556
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:12,679
they sell all their merch. This is the main event here.

557
00:54:13,239 --> 00:54:22,789
Oh I muted it. I like almost broke something. Hold on I freaked out.

558
00:54:22,789 --> 00:54:30,699
So uh something that you need to know is just because you were in the

559
00:54:30,699 --> 00:54:36,170
pre-matches does not mean you are in the rumble.

560
00:54:36,170 --> 00:54:46,280
I need to make I had to make room for a lot of fucking people. So

561
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:52,630
there are way there are a lot more characters that you have not seen.

562
00:54:52,630 --> 00:54:55,429
I can't get over that. I was thinking they were gonna throw him through a

563
00:54:55,429 --> 00:55:01,980
TV. I can't. I can't. I gotta like compose

564
00:55:01,980 --> 00:55:10,519
myself here. All right I'm ready.

565
00:55:10,519 --> 00:55:12,760
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the main event. This is the Jerma Rumble

566
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:23,769
2018. I hope you enjoy it. Let's get it started. You know the

567
00:55:23,769 --> 00:55:27,210
rules. Every minute or so another contestant

568
00:55:27,210 --> 00:55:32,280
is going to come out to the ring. Uh there is no commentary so this

569
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:37,340
you cannot hear what this person is saying.

570
00:55:37,340 --> 00:55:42,380
The first 10 usually have an incredibly incredibly high disadvantage

571
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:46,679
but it is very possible. Welcome to the Jerma Rumble 2018

572
00:55:46,679 --> 00:55:54,340
stream edition. They're all stream editions at this point.

573
00:55:54,340 --> 00:56:02,090
Over the top ropes you're out. That's the only way. That is the only way.

574
00:56:02,090 --> 00:56:13,670
30 contestants. 30. That's right. 30. Mic muted. Well her mic is muted.

575
00:56:13,670 --> 00:56:18,550
That's fine. Mine's not. Mine's open. I wonder who the first

576
00:56:18,550 --> 00:56:22,309
contestant is. It's all random. It's completely randomized so I have no

577
00:56:22,309 --> 00:56:25,349
idea. I'm watching this at the same time

578
00:56:25,429 --> 00:56:29,639
as you guys. The first contestant coming out.

579
00:56:29,639 --> 00:56:35,579
Why is there music? Why is there music for Jax?

580
00:56:35,579 --> 00:56:43,500
There shouldn't be any music but there's Jax, the first contestant.

581
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:47,579
Making his first ever appearance. One of the most highly skilled video game

582
00:56:47,579 --> 00:56:59,320
players to ever live. He had an embroidery down I see.

583
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:06,760
That's a pretty nice embroidery. I will say it looks pretty nice.

584
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:11,369
Can we see some Jax's in the chat? I would like to see it maybe.

585
00:57:11,369 --> 00:57:15,670
We already see them. He's at a severe disadvantage though.

586
00:57:15,670 --> 00:57:24,659
Because Jax is number one which is nearly impossible.

587
00:57:24,659 --> 00:57:33,559
Maybe he'll go all the way. We've seen stranger things for sure.

588
00:57:33,559 --> 00:57:38,230
Tag me in. No that's not going to happen. Contestant number two.

589
00:57:38,230 --> 00:57:45,699
The first two. Who is number two? I'm excited. I'm ready.

590
00:57:45,699 --> 00:57:49,719
That's Sweet Rind. Sweet Rind is contestant number two.

591
00:57:49,719 --> 00:57:54,869
Just coming off of a victory with Beanbag Sonic.

592
00:57:54,869 --> 00:58:06,659
Sweet Rind and Jax are the first two. I wonder how long it's going to take.

593
00:58:06,659 --> 00:58:11,769
David and Goliath. Well this is Jax we're talking about.

594
00:58:11,769 --> 00:58:16,099
This ain't just some shitty regular Jerma. You know.

595
00:58:16,099 --> 00:58:20,340
This is my alternate personality. Jax. 2018 Germania.

596
00:58:20,340 --> 00:58:25,210
Jerma rumble has started. Oh game almost crashed at the very beginning.

597
00:58:25,210 --> 00:58:31,030
That would have been real bad. But we got Jax and Sweet Rind in at

598
00:58:31,030 --> 00:58:32,949
the very beginning here trying to get his

599
00:58:32,949 --> 00:58:36,869
up the leg there. Nice throwing him backwards.

600
00:58:36,869 --> 00:58:40,230
And we already have another contestant coming in here.

601
00:58:40,230 --> 00:58:44,630
Already. It hasn't even been 20 seconds. Contestant number three coming in as

602
00:58:44,630 --> 00:58:50,059
Jax does a patented Jerma move. Garrett's coming in next from the

603
00:58:50,059 --> 00:58:58,059
Sims murder house as contestant number three. There he is.

604
00:58:58,059 --> 00:59:01,099
Making his way. Oh nice fireman's carry. Tossing him over the shoulder

605
00:59:01,099 --> 00:59:04,900
there. Blocks that punch. Jax is going to be in it. I would

606
00:59:04,900 --> 00:59:08,260
triple or quadruple or septuple team Jax.

607
00:59:08,260 --> 00:59:13,079
He has the highest stats in the whole game. He's literally unbeatable.

608
00:59:13,079 --> 00:59:18,900
He is 100% unbeatable. I'd like to see what they do here.

609
00:59:18,900 --> 00:59:23,590
As Garrett is just taunting the crowd. Here comes contestant number four.

610
00:59:23,590 --> 00:59:29,460
It's Pinwheel. Pinwheel with a small eye.

611
00:59:29,460 --> 00:59:36,199
He just picked him up and made him do a leg drop onto Sweet Rind's head.

612
00:59:36,199 --> 00:59:40,119
That was a tag team effort there. That was not somebody doing a move.

613
00:59:40,119 --> 00:59:44,059
That was an actual double team on Sweet Rind. So you

614
00:59:44,059 --> 00:59:46,619
got Jax, Pinwheel, Garrett and Sweet Rind

615
00:59:46,619 --> 00:59:49,420
in the ring right now and Sweet Rind is going to try to eliminate the

616
00:59:49,420 --> 00:59:51,980
competition here. Can Sweet Rind get rid of Jax?

617
00:59:51,980 --> 00:59:56,070
Is Jax going to go out first ever? No that can't be. It's impossible.

618
00:59:56,070 --> 01:00:00,260
It's impossible. It's impossible. I told you. Here comes contestant number

619
01:00:00,260 --> 01:00:05,510
five. Lou. Oh of course I know who Lou is.

620
01:00:05,510 --> 01:00:11,639
That's Lou Elberton from the Elberton family.

621
01:00:11,639 --> 01:00:17,670
Jeremy's Uncle Lou. Jax and Uncle Lou both incredibly powerful.

622
01:00:17,670 --> 01:00:21,940
He was so excited to come here. He was so excited he was going to make

623
01:00:21,940 --> 01:00:24,980
his first appearance and he's going to eliminate Pinwheel

624
01:00:24,980 --> 01:00:28,860
for Jeremy because he knows he hates his fucking character and he hates all the

625
01:00:28,860 --> 01:00:32,519
chat memes. No he's not strong enough and without

626
01:00:32,519 --> 01:00:35,880
even thinking Sweet Rind has been eliminated

627
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:41,239
and now we've got Jax giving a powerbomb and here comes Glueman.

628
01:00:41,239 --> 01:00:47,179
Glueman making his appearance. Jax seems to for some reason have powerbombed

629
01:00:47,179 --> 01:00:52,230
Uncle Lou and he's... Glueman is going to go right for Jax.

630
01:00:52,230 --> 01:00:55,510
He is certain that if he wants to win this rumble for the first time ever

631
01:00:55,510 --> 01:00:59,030
he's been a part of every single rumble. He has to take out the

632
01:00:59,030 --> 01:01:05,030
strongest competitor but it's going to be very difficult for Glueman.

633
01:01:05,030 --> 01:01:09,909
We've got a very very full ring here. Sweet Rind first to be eliminated.

634
01:01:09,909 --> 01:01:14,150
Jax with a jumping drop kick on Glueman. This is going to be a tough one

635
01:01:14,150 --> 01:01:18,679
and Dr. Schmeichsen. The lie detector doctor

636
01:01:18,679 --> 01:01:22,440
making his first ever appearance as well. A lot of first timers here. Dr.

637
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:25,849
Schmeichsen trying to go for a diving face

638
01:01:25,849 --> 01:01:29,019
butt but he did not make it. Garrett now

639
01:01:29,019 --> 01:01:31,099
is going to get over the top rubs. Is it possible they're going to double team?

640
01:01:31,099 --> 01:01:33,820
Garrett here. Lou in pinwheel. There he goes.

641
01:01:33,820 --> 01:01:42,539
Garrett has been eliminated by Uncle Lou in pinwheel. Dr. Schmeichsen,

642
01:01:42,539 --> 01:01:49,239
Lou, Jax, Glueman in pinwheel. Here comes another contestant. I'm hearing

643
01:01:49,239 --> 01:01:53,800
a lot of boos. Oh they put... what is that Bill? Oh

644
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:59,449
did he get up? Did he actually get up? It's Bill crazy!

645
01:01:59,449 --> 01:02:02,889
He's actually not dead. Dr. Schmeichsen

646
01:02:02,889 --> 01:02:06,940
is about to eliminate Jax. No it's impossible.

647
01:02:06,940 --> 01:02:10,539
It's it's literally not even possible. Good luck.

648
01:02:10,539 --> 01:02:15,460
He's the most under speeded video game champion to ever live. Bill crazy now

649
01:02:15,460 --> 01:02:22,010
has Uncle Lou in a powerbomb! Is he gone? Jax did not like that.

650
01:02:22,010 --> 01:02:33,349
His Uncle Lou has been eliminated. Oh my god. Is he gonna do it?

651
01:02:33,349 --> 01:02:40,900
Manchester from... he's naked. He's naked. Manchester from oblivion

652
01:02:40,900 --> 01:02:43,619
is going to get instantly eliminated. Bill crazy is gone.

653
01:02:43,619 --> 01:02:47,900
Lou is gone. Jax doing some fancy footwork. Taunting the crowd. He knows

654
01:02:47,900 --> 01:02:51,579
he is an indisputable champion. He'll never be beaten.

655
01:02:51,579 --> 01:02:56,469
Nice right hand on a Majestank or the Flu for those of you that are keeping

656
01:02:56,469 --> 01:03:00,500
track. Pinwheel now two weird characters from very different games.

657
01:03:00,500 --> 01:03:05,079
Is it possible? Will pinwheel be eliminated by? No not by Majestank.

658
01:03:05,079 --> 01:03:07,239
The Flu. Dr. Schmeichsen now. He's got a

659
01:03:07,239 --> 01:03:10,199
cure for the Flu. It's called two right hands and an elbow to the back

660
01:03:10,199 --> 01:03:13,079
of the skull. He's got a cure for the Flu.

661
01:03:13,849 --> 01:03:22,619
Ladies and gentlemen coming in here next is the Car Valet from Sleeping Dogs.

662
01:03:22,619 --> 01:03:28,360
Somebody order a car? I think so. There he is.

663
01:03:28,360 --> 01:03:33,079
The Car Valet. Oh and immediately gets stopped by Glue Man.

664
01:03:33,079 --> 01:03:42,099
We got the Dr. Schmeichsen now who seemed to have. Oh no.

665
01:03:42,099 --> 01:03:46,179
Wow is is is Car is the Car Valet gonna actually eliminate Glue Man? This

666
01:03:46,179 --> 01:03:48,420
would be so sad. This would be so sad for Glue Man.

667
01:03:48,420 --> 01:03:51,460
He's tried so many times. He's tried... Jax is about to be

668
01:03:51,460 --> 01:03:54,250
eliminated by Pinwheel. Don't you fucking dare.

669
01:03:54,329 --> 01:04:02,469
No. Yes it's impossible. Don't do it. Do not. Pinwheel do not eliminate Jax.

670
01:04:02,469 --> 01:04:07,559
Please god. Thank god. Here comes the green screen.

671
01:04:07,559 --> 01:04:10,360
Put whatever character you want here. This is the green screen from last

672
01:04:10,360 --> 01:04:13,670
weekend. If you want to put uh like Super

673
01:04:13,670 --> 01:04:18,150
Mario here or you want to put you know like the fat guy or like

674
01:04:18,150 --> 01:04:23,030
Peter Griffin or something. He's there for you. He's marked. He's huge.

675
01:04:23,030 --> 01:04:25,829
Well the green screen is huge. Dr. Schmeichsen now going

676
01:04:25,829 --> 01:04:29,099
with a couple of kicks into Jax's face.

677
01:04:29,099 --> 01:04:36,760
There are so many people in this ring. It's actually getting ridiculous.

678
01:04:36,760 --> 01:04:42,280
What? Is that actually Sans from Undertale?

679
01:04:42,280 --> 01:04:49,900
That's Sans from Undertale. There he is. There are too many people in the

680
01:04:49,900 --> 01:04:52,059
ring. Sans making his first appearance in

681
01:04:52,059 --> 01:04:56,380
Gerber Rumble. One, two, three, four, five, six.

682
01:04:56,380 --> 01:05:00,300
There are eight people in the ring. Is Glue Man gonna get his

683
01:05:00,300 --> 01:05:04,139
elimination here on Dr. Schmeichsen? This is a this is

684
01:05:04,139 --> 01:05:08,519
assault on another person. Oh but he reverses it. Green

685
01:05:08,599 --> 01:05:12,300
screen now. We got the car valets in a bad spot.

686
01:05:12,300 --> 01:05:17,659
Dr. Schmeichsen now trying to. Oh no. Green screen. The green screen almost

687
01:05:17,659 --> 01:05:20,780
just eliminated Sans in what seems like three or four

688
01:05:20,780 --> 01:05:24,739
seconds. How do you fight a green screen?

689
01:05:24,739 --> 01:05:28,469
You just get tangled up in it. You can't even go near it. You're gonna

690
01:05:28,469 --> 01:05:30,869
cast shadows on it. People are gonna scream at you.

691
01:05:30,869 --> 01:05:34,940
Glue Man though trying again. Trying to do it. No.

692
01:05:34,940 --> 01:05:38,219
No eliminations with eight people. Glue Man reverses it now.

693
01:05:38,219 --> 01:05:42,809
He's gonna push him out. There's a lot of possibilities here.

694
01:05:42,809 --> 01:05:49,750
Jax just eliminated the car valet. That's another elimination from Jax.

695
01:05:49,750 --> 01:05:53,750
He was the first one in. Will he be the last one in as well as

696
01:05:53,750 --> 01:06:00,059
go after Pinwheel? Dump him out of here. Jax is unbeatable

697
01:06:00,059 --> 01:06:04,309
and I mean that. I mean it. And he's not gonna lose to Pinwheel.

698
01:06:04,309 --> 01:06:09,349
No like old shit Gerber beat Pinwheel. Jax cannot lose to Pinwheel.

699
01:06:09,349 --> 01:06:13,179
That would. Don't do it. Please don't do it. Fight back Jax.

700
01:06:13,179 --> 01:06:16,380
Do so. The Jax. There we go. Thank god.

701
01:06:16,380 --> 01:06:22,699
The green screen now has got Dr. Schmeichsen while Sands is in the

702
01:06:22,699 --> 01:06:27,000
corner. Is he gonna go for elimination? I wonder

703
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:30,039
what character is about to eliminate Dr. Schmeichsen.

704
01:06:30,039 --> 01:06:38,119
He's got a chance. No. No. He's not gonna.

705
01:06:38,119 --> 01:06:42,440
A shooting star press from Magistake and there goes Dr. Schmeichsen.

706
01:06:42,440 --> 01:06:45,820
Dr. Schmeichsen is gone. Pinwheel is just

707
01:06:45,820 --> 01:06:50,139
taunting. Pinwheel is taunting everybody. Sands did not like that.

708
01:06:50,219 --> 01:06:54,599
Sands is gonna come up with Pinwheel. Now gets chopped in the face

709
01:06:54,599 --> 01:06:57,719
for his efforts. Here comes. What is with the moves

710
01:06:57,719 --> 01:07:02,280
from Magistake? Another competitor it seems like ages since we've seen

711
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:07,099
somebody new. And it's Beanbag Sonic coming in

712
01:07:07,099 --> 01:07:11,610
somewhere about at the midway point. That's a pretty good place to be.

713
01:07:11,610 --> 01:07:15,190
Beanbag Sonic making his first ever appearance in the rumble.

714
01:07:15,190 --> 01:07:19,030
What happened? Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Did Jax. Wait. Hold on.

715
01:07:19,030 --> 01:07:25,079
Hey. No. Hold on. Jax. Who. I didn't even see it.

716
01:07:25,079 --> 01:07:28,519
Who eliminated Jax and Glooman? Those are the two

717
01:07:28,519 --> 01:07:34,380
favorites. They're not gonna win. Jax and Glooman are both gone.

718
01:07:34,380 --> 01:07:38,090
Did the green screen eliminate Jax? No fucking way.

719
01:07:38,090 --> 01:07:43,400
God damn it. I was looking at like. I was looking at.

720
01:07:43,400 --> 01:07:47,989
They're both doing the same animation. There it goes.

721
01:07:47,989 --> 01:07:53,059
Jax and Glooman. Glooman will never win. He's just never gonna win.

722
01:07:53,059 --> 01:07:56,579
We'll take your pick in here. I'm rooting for Beanbag Sonic.

723
01:07:56,579 --> 01:08:02,059
I think he deserves it. And Beanbag Sonic and Sands both

724
01:08:02,139 --> 01:08:07,579
equal weight here. Sonic is fresh. Beanbag Sonic is brand

725
01:08:07,579 --> 01:08:13,510
new so no fatigue while Sands. What does Sonic have in mind here?

726
01:08:13,510 --> 01:08:20,819
What is he doing? Beanbag Sonic. You hear that crowd scream.

727
01:08:20,819 --> 01:08:25,770
Is Beanbag Sonic going to go around and eliminate every person?

728
01:08:25,770 --> 01:08:29,529
That is elimination number one for Beanbag Sonic.

729
01:08:29,529 --> 01:08:34,739
Dropped him on his head. Here comes another contestant all the way from

730
01:08:34,739 --> 01:08:39,819
the one stream that everybody hated. Soon to be on a Christmas special.

731
01:08:39,819 --> 01:08:47,239
That's BF Bugleberry. Resident scary storyteller.

732
01:08:47,239 --> 01:08:51,770
There goes Pinwheel. The green screen is too strong.

733
01:08:51,770 --> 01:08:56,220
The green screen is too strong. I don't know why it's this powerful.

734
01:08:56,220 --> 01:09:01,239
BF Bugleberry. Sands is gone. Green screen now looking like the

735
01:09:01,239 --> 01:09:08,100
person to beat here. Defense is still outside.

736
01:09:08,100 --> 01:09:12,340
Beanbag Sonic. The green screen. Willem Dafoe is number 15 at the halfway

737
01:09:12,340 --> 01:09:14,659
mark. We have made it to halfway through the

738
01:09:14,659 --> 01:09:19,260
2018 rumble. And there is Willem Dafoe. Something of a

739
01:09:20,140 --> 01:09:25,619
scientist. There he is. Half of one of Jeremy's emotes.

740
01:09:25,619 --> 01:09:28,659
And please get rid of the fucking green screen. Do it, Dafoe.

741
01:09:28,659 --> 01:09:33,159
Channel the goblin. You can do it. Channel the green goblin. He's green.

742
01:09:33,159 --> 01:09:39,399
He didn't even want to do it. He didn't care. Why did you do that?

743
01:09:39,399 --> 01:09:42,680
Let the goblin take over. Don't just let him eliminate you. What are you

744
01:09:42,680 --> 01:09:49,560
doing? No. Bugleberry is gone. Bugleberry.

745
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:52,600
I wanted him to win. Bugleberry is gone. Gets eliminated by Beanbag Sonic.

746
01:09:52,600 --> 01:09:59,529
And in comes binary man. 0-1-1-0-1-10-0-0-2-2.

747
01:09:59,529 --> 01:10:06,760
From the detective stream. He's incredibly strong.

748
01:10:06,760 --> 01:10:10,279
He's not. Oh no, he's not. Is Beanbag Sonic about to-

749
01:10:10,279 --> 01:10:19,850
Yeah, binary man 0-1-1-0-1-0-0-1-1. Welcome to the rumble. Nice cartwheel by

750
01:10:19,850 --> 01:10:26,149
the green goblin, aka Willem Dafoe. Just testing the mat, I guess. Beanbag

751
01:10:26,149 --> 01:10:30,140
Sonic, it would be a shame if binary man eliminated you.

752
01:10:30,140 --> 01:10:33,859
It's all right. Because I think I just heard something.

753
01:10:33,859 --> 01:10:36,020
I just heard that. I've waited. The green screen's about to come out. Green

754
01:10:36,020 --> 01:10:39,380
screen's going out. Maybe wall dad's coming in.

755
01:10:39,380 --> 01:10:45,140
No, it's- Oh, what a right hand by wall dad. I just heard a sledgehammer break

756
01:10:45,140 --> 01:10:47,380
over on the side of the wall there, and I

757
01:10:47,380 --> 01:10:53,079
I heard it, but what is that for a t-shirt? What is that?

758
01:10:53,079 --> 01:10:56,680
Okay, he's wearing his son's Minecon shirt.

759
01:10:56,680 --> 01:11:00,489
Okay, that's fine. I mean, he has to find a way to put clothes on.

760
01:11:00,489 --> 01:11:08,789
He's hiding the wall. Wall dad from House Flipper. What's that smell?

761
01:11:09,670 --> 01:11:14,390
That smells delicious. That smells kind of like a red blend wine to me.

762
01:11:14,390 --> 01:11:18,229
Binary man has been eliminated as red blend. The wine glass

763
01:11:18,229 --> 01:11:24,439
with the cork head comes in. Binary man is gone. Beanbag Sonic is still in.

764
01:11:24,439 --> 01:11:27,479
Magistank is still in. Willem Dafoe is still in. Green screen.

765
01:11:27,479 --> 01:11:31,340
Sonic is about to get eliminated by the red blend. Oh, that would be

766
01:11:31,340 --> 01:11:37,539
unfortunate. It does taste great, though.

767
01:11:37,539 --> 01:11:41,779
Beanbag Sonic is on the ropes. No, wall dad

768
01:11:41,779 --> 01:11:46,250
misses a punch there from the green screen. Oh, and here comes Adam Sandler.

769
01:11:46,250 --> 01:11:53,750
No, no, no. The green screen needs to be eliminated. Adam Sandler

770
01:11:53,750 --> 01:11:57,350
going right for the green screen. Using his comedic comedy technique.

771
01:11:57,350 --> 01:12:05,050
Will he eliminate the green screen? Pick him up. He's fired up after that

772
01:12:05,050 --> 01:12:08,100
loss. Adam Sandler, and there goes the

773
01:12:08,100 --> 01:12:10,420
red blend. Beanbag Sonic has eliminated another

774
01:12:10,420 --> 01:12:20,039
contestant. Red blend is now gone, but it is good. So you got Willem Dafoe,

775
01:12:20,039 --> 01:12:22,680
Beanbag Sonic, green screen, Adam Sandler, and Magistank,

776
01:12:22,680 --> 01:12:27,350
except maybe not for long. Big drop kick there by Willem Dafoe.

777
01:12:27,350 --> 01:12:35,300
Don't. The green screen is about to eliminate another person.

778
01:12:35,300 --> 01:12:41,859
No, no. Somebody has to stop him. Somebody stop the green screen before

779
01:12:41,859 --> 01:12:44,979
he eliminates like 50 people. Hopefully it'll be Elvis.

780
01:12:44,979 --> 01:12:48,899
Hopefully it'll be Elvis from Las Vegas, Nevada.

781
01:12:48,899 --> 01:12:53,850
Come on, get in there, Elvis. Jerma's move to Vegas

782
01:12:53,850 --> 01:12:58,329
has proved to be successful. Elvis, of course, and look at how many

783
01:12:58,329 --> 01:13:00,729
people it takes to try to get the green screen out.

784
01:13:00,729 --> 01:13:04,250
You need three. Elvis, get over. Don't touch Beanbag Sonic.

785
01:13:04,250 --> 01:13:07,689
Go after the green screen. He's unbeatable. He's the Jex of this

786
01:13:07,689 --> 01:13:11,930
competition. What are you thinking? Nice reverse. Then there goes Beanbag

787
01:13:11,930 --> 01:13:14,329
Sonic. Elvis eliminated Beanbag Sonic.

788
01:13:14,329 --> 01:13:20,489
Sad day, but he may eliminate the green screen. That's unfortunate.

789
01:13:20,489 --> 01:13:24,100
Oh, fucking great. How did he get in here?

790
01:13:24,100 --> 01:13:32,199
Really? He fucking, he hacked my, he hacked my fucking game.

791
01:13:32,199 --> 01:13:37,779
Put himself in. Fucking loser. That's GrillmasterxBDQ.

792
01:13:37,779 --> 01:13:41,989
The guy that I made a video with or something like that.

793
01:13:41,989 --> 01:13:46,409
He's another, like, screamer. He sucks.

794
01:13:47,319 --> 01:13:50,600
This is his, like, haha, ultimate, like, I got you, right? Like, you come

795
01:13:50,600 --> 01:13:54,789
in with the Jerma Rumble. Like, my fucking thing.

796
01:13:54,869 --> 01:13:59,979
I don't even know what he made of stats, but that's fucking annoying.

797
01:13:59,979 --> 01:14:03,899
Anyways, GrillmasterxBDQ, an old cooking channel from YouTube, is

798
01:14:03,899 --> 01:14:09,850
going to be welcomed by GaryTheFuckUp. Maybe GaryTheFuckUp can

799
01:14:09,850 --> 01:14:13,939
get some more YouTube footage of him hurting people,

800
01:14:13,939 --> 01:14:16,979
as he's got Willem Dafoe over the shoulder here. No, gets reversed by

801
01:14:16,979 --> 01:14:22,710
Willem Dafoe. Elvis, Grillmaster, the green

802
01:14:22,710 --> 01:14:28,229
screen, GaryTheFuckUp, Magistank, and speaking of Grillmaster, is he

803
01:14:28,229 --> 01:14:33,340
going to eliminate Elvis? Elvis is not eliminated. He's still in

804
01:14:33,340 --> 01:14:39,189
the ring, and here comes Otto. Otto the Duxen. It's taken me four or

805
01:14:39,189 --> 01:14:46,520
five years to put him in, but there he is. There's Otto.

806
01:14:47,510 --> 01:14:52,569
Hey, come on. Like, please let him get in the ring for a second.

807
01:14:52,569 --> 01:14:56,090
GaryTheFuckUp is gone. Willem Dafoe with a Lariat.

808
01:14:56,090 --> 01:15:00,489
An absolutely hellish Lariat to GaryTheFuckUp.

809
01:15:00,489 --> 01:15:04,170
Both the duo of Bill Crazy and GaryTheFuckUp are gone.

810
01:15:04,170 --> 01:15:07,850
Otto comes in. The longest person that's been in here, the green screen, has been

811
01:15:07,850 --> 01:15:09,689
in here the absolute longest. It's been

812
01:15:09,689 --> 01:15:14,569
almost 20 straight minutes. Oh, right. I forgot.

813
01:15:14,569 --> 01:15:23,859
There comes Jerma Raptor. The most embarrassing thing I've ever done

814
01:15:23,859 --> 01:15:27,539
is now in the ring. I feel like he deserved to be there, and I would make

815
01:15:27,539 --> 01:15:30,630
I would be so happy if you threw this guy out right now.

816
01:15:30,630 --> 01:15:36,119
I would be ecstatic if Jerma Raptor threw Grillmaster XBBQ out right now.

817
01:15:36,119 --> 01:15:39,449
What do you do? Are you using it as an exercise ball? Are you going to let

818
01:15:39,449 --> 01:15:43,130
him do that to you? Really? Willem Dafoe taking a

819
01:15:43,130 --> 01:15:48,489
little bit of a break as the green screen just knows how strong

820
01:15:48,489 --> 01:15:51,130
he is and knows that no one stands a chance.

821
01:15:51,130 --> 01:15:54,649
He just pushed Jerma Raptor, and thank God.

822
01:15:54,649 --> 01:15:59,100
Thank you, Elvis. Elvis just eliminated Grillmaster XBBQ

823
01:15:59,100 --> 01:16:02,380
to never return. They'll never be in another Rumble ever again. I'm

824
01:16:02,380 --> 01:16:05,180
deleting the character. Is he eliminating himself? What the

825
01:16:05,180 --> 01:16:10,569
fuck was that? What? What did Otto just do? Did

826
01:16:10,569 --> 01:16:13,289
Otto just fake him? Why didn't you put a Raptor?

827
01:16:13,289 --> 01:16:18,010
Just jump over the ropes for no reason. Well, it's okay.

828
01:16:18,010 --> 01:16:21,770
Jerma Raptor will get replaced by another Jerma character. Here comes

829
01:16:21,770 --> 01:16:26,460
Odd Michael. You can't put capes on in this game for some reason, but

830
01:16:26,460 --> 01:16:29,560
there's Odd Michael. This is going to get interesting. There

831
01:16:29,560 --> 01:16:32,359
goes Willem Dafoe. Magistank throws Willem Dafoe over the top ropes.

832
01:16:32,359 --> 01:16:40,180
You've got Elvis and Odd Michael in the same spot. Will they work together?

833
01:16:40,180 --> 01:16:46,140
I would love to see a Jerma Odd Michael and an Elvis collaboration here.

834
01:16:46,140 --> 01:16:49,020
Going after his own dog while the fucking green screen is about to throw

835
01:16:49,020 --> 01:16:55,619
another person over the top ropes. Thankfully, Elvis ain't down with that

836
01:16:55,619 --> 01:17:01,430
as he breaks out of what could have been a terrible situation for him.

837
01:17:01,430 --> 01:17:03,670
No, they're fighting each other. Don't fight each other. You should be

838
01:17:03,670 --> 01:17:08,149
helping each other. The three of you. Yes, just get taunted by the green

839
01:17:08,149 --> 01:17:14,539
screen while he just does a boot party on Elvis. Magistank is still

840
01:17:14,539 --> 01:17:18,380
in the ear clap. He just crushed it. He just gave him a

841
01:17:18,380 --> 01:17:22,630
migrate. Otto now has Odd Michael while the green screen,

842
01:17:22,630 --> 01:17:27,699
thank god, has not eliminated a seventh person potentially.

843
01:17:27,699 --> 01:17:33,020
No, there it is. There goes Elvis by the green screen, but I have high hopes

844
01:17:33,020 --> 01:17:41,739
for the Nintendo Labo. I have extraordinarily high hopes.

845
01:17:41,739 --> 01:17:46,149
Taking a long time to get in here. There he is. The Nintendo Switch Labo.

846
01:17:46,149 --> 01:17:49,109
And he just just goes right after Jerma for making such a terribly

847
01:17:49,109 --> 01:17:53,640
boring stream three times. Make sure you do it on the fold lines.

848
01:17:53,640 --> 01:17:57,739
Crease the fold lines well when you throw him out. Otherwise, what the

849
01:17:57,739 --> 01:18:05,260
fuck are you doing, Odd Michael? There was absolutely no reason to do that.

850
01:18:05,260 --> 01:18:09,079
This would be pretty poetic if Odd Michael were to be eliminated by the

851
01:18:09,079 --> 01:18:11,979
Labo as the green screen is in a very bad

852
01:18:11,979 --> 01:18:19,909
position for the Quiet Man to come in. Quiet Man number 27. 27. In comes the

853
01:18:19,909 --> 01:18:27,960
Quiet Man from literally the worst game ever as

854
01:18:27,960 --> 01:18:32,119
he picks up Odd Michael over the shoulder. No, a reversal.

855
01:18:32,119 --> 01:18:39,380
Quiet Man is one of the last three. Get him out of here.

856
01:18:39,380 --> 01:18:42,840
Get the green screen out of here of all the people.

857
01:18:42,840 --> 01:18:45,960
I can't fucking believe he's still in this. He's about to throw a magic tank

858
01:18:45,960 --> 01:18:50,220
over the top ropes. Is it gonna be possible? There he goes.

859
01:18:50,220 --> 01:18:55,909
Chuck Schnoswell number 28. Will somebody stop him?

860
01:18:55,909 --> 01:19:03,500
Somebody please. He's just, he's just the new Jax.

861
01:19:03,500 --> 01:19:08,840
Chuck Schnoswell coming in. Will he be the hero that we all hope for?

862
01:19:08,840 --> 01:19:13,350
Come on, Chuck. He feels the crowd. He feels the energy of the audience.

863
01:19:13,350 --> 01:19:17,590
Will Chuck Schnoswell eliminate the most impossible to eliminate Contender?

864
01:19:17,590 --> 01:19:21,130
He's got him over the top just barely pushing his legs.

865
01:19:21,130 --> 01:19:26,579
Come on, Chuck. Use the fucking nose. Use your nose, Chuck.

866
01:19:26,579 --> 01:19:30,899
Get it! Get it! No!

867
01:19:30,899 --> 01:19:34,699
Otto is about to throw Odd Michael over the top ropes.

868
01:19:34,699 --> 01:19:40,520
And here comes a Hornet from the fucking wall of the old house.

869
01:19:40,520 --> 01:19:45,670
If there's anybody that can do it, it's definitely him. And the Quiet Man

870
01:19:45,670 --> 01:19:49,270
is about to throw. No, thank God it was just a scoopslam. Chuck Schnoswell

871
01:19:49,270 --> 01:19:56,539
now for that insolence. And that's

872
01:19:58,069 --> 01:20:10,020
come on. No. Well, somebody sprayed the Hornet.

873
01:20:10,020 --> 01:20:15,449
He's gone. That was all it took. Just swatted him. What an

874
01:20:15,449 --> 01:20:19,609
overhead press by the Quiet Man. On to Otto the Dog.

875
01:20:19,609 --> 01:20:23,939
Odd Michael trying to put work into the green screen.

876
01:20:23,939 --> 01:20:29,319
Huge chokeslam. And there goes Odd. No. There goes. Who the fuck was it?

877
01:20:29,319 --> 01:20:33,609
Who just got thrown out? Otto. Oh God. It's Otto the Dog has been

878
01:20:33,609 --> 01:20:38,020
eliminated by the Quiet Man. And the Quiet Man is about to

879
01:20:38,020 --> 01:20:44,090
powerbomb the Labo. He is incredibly strong. Green screen

880
01:20:44,090 --> 01:20:47,369
still cannot get thrown out after being double teamed.

881
01:20:47,369 --> 01:20:52,470
We only have two more people coming in. Nice miss, Odd Michael.

882
01:20:52,470 --> 01:20:58,819
You're shitty Dr. Strange. This booze coming in.

883
01:20:58,819 --> 01:21:02,489
Could this be? Can we get the last person?

884
01:21:02,489 --> 01:21:09,829
The last person is Fireman. What is he?

885
01:21:09,829 --> 01:21:15,449
Holy shit. He's fresh and he's the last contestant.

886
01:21:15,449 --> 01:21:20,890
Get rid of that fucking green screen. The green screen is dazed.

887
01:21:20,890 --> 01:21:28,460
He's tired. He's confused. Fireman. Oh no. Just barely. You didn't do it.

888
01:21:28,460 --> 01:21:31,420
I think he's so stupid. He thinks he did it.

889
01:21:31,420 --> 01:21:34,300
He thought he eliminated him. He couldn't tell he was invisible. Somebody

890
01:21:34,300 --> 01:21:37,880
keyed him out. Somebody keyed the green screen out. No.

891
01:21:37,880 --> 01:21:44,619
There goes Odd Michael. Fireman fighting for his life.

892
01:21:44,619 --> 01:21:48,300
The green screen just can't seem to do it. One of these contestants will

893
01:21:48,300 --> 01:21:51,260
win. One of these contestants will win. The

894
01:21:51,260 --> 01:21:53,340
Labo has just been limited by Chuck Schnauzwell.

895
01:21:53,340 --> 01:21:57,500
Fireman green screen to the Quiet Man. One of these four will be your 2018

896
01:21:57,500 --> 01:22:02,460
champion. It's just absolute bullshit that he

897
01:22:02,460 --> 01:22:07,159
can just be keyed out whenever he wants. He can turn invisible.

898
01:22:07,159 --> 01:22:09,000
He can turn into other people. He can turn into you

899
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:14,710
and you think you're in the ring. What a reversal by Fireman. Will

900
01:22:14,710 --> 01:22:19,270
Fireman come in as the last spot and clean up the whole ring?

901
01:22:19,270 --> 01:22:25,529
No. Not quite. Quiet Man gets dropped on a knee there.

902
01:22:25,529 --> 01:22:29,850
What is he pointing to? I think he's just trying to get some energy here.

903
01:22:29,850 --> 01:22:33,689
Chuck Schnauzwell doing a dab from one of his best friends, Beanbag Sonic. They

904
01:22:33,689 --> 01:22:37,529
become really close friends actually since those videos. And can Chuck

905
01:22:37,529 --> 01:22:41,340
Schnauzwell with the strength of 50. No.

906
01:22:41,340 --> 01:22:47,750
No. With the strength of 50 bats. Being able to throw him over.

907
01:22:47,750 --> 01:22:51,689
Uh-oh. Quiet Man with a big right hand.

908
01:22:51,689 --> 01:22:54,970
We've got to see an elimination here. We got to see a green screen

909
01:22:54,970 --> 01:23:00,140
Quiet Man elimination. Chuck Schnauzwell with a huge suplex.

910
01:23:00,140 --> 01:23:05,260
You've got two fan favorites. A character that I put in

911
01:23:05,260 --> 01:23:09,609
because of a stream I did three days ago and the green screen.

912
01:23:09,609 --> 01:23:15,989
Who is going to win? Chuck Schnauzwell now in the air. The green screen

913
01:23:15,989 --> 01:23:19,770
just seems to pick up all these characters like toys

914
01:23:19,770 --> 01:23:24,149
as Fireman is going to see an opportunity to pick up Quiet Man and

915
01:23:24,149 --> 01:23:27,960
maybe get something done here. Scooping him up over the shoulder.

916
01:23:27,960 --> 01:23:33,109
Throwing him backwards into the ground. Oh knees to the face.

917
01:23:33,109 --> 01:23:36,979
That's got to hurt though. He might get burnt. The top of the head

918
01:23:36,979 --> 01:23:41,430
of Fireman is very very strong now and I don't know what he's doing here.

919
01:23:41,430 --> 01:23:46,779
He's working trying to break his leg as the green screen

920
01:23:46,779 --> 01:23:49,819
has no gets reversed by Fireman. Not in a good position.

921
01:23:49,819 --> 01:23:54,119
Oh Quiet Man has Chuck on the this is not good for Chuck.

922
01:23:54,119 --> 01:23:58,220
Quiet Man could see an elimination here and will be down to three.

923
01:23:58,220 --> 01:24:02,890
Fireman is awaiting the consciousness to it.

924
01:24:02,890 --> 01:24:08,409
Come on Fireman. Oh no. He gets stopped by a stray punch

925
01:24:08,489 --> 01:24:17,159
by Chuck Schnauzwell. I will say though these four

926
01:24:17,159 --> 01:24:21,079
they're giving it all they got. Chuck is just getting punched. Have to punch

927
01:24:21,079 --> 01:24:27,430
in the face over and over again. Thank god he's got that nose armor and

928
01:24:27,430 --> 01:24:32,119
now Chuck is in the grasp of the green screen.

929
01:24:32,119 --> 01:24:37,899
No man. No thing. No person has been able to

930
01:24:37,899 --> 01:24:43,029
stop him. As you see the Quiet Man. Chuck Schnauzwell is gone. It's

931
01:24:43,029 --> 01:24:48,300
Quiet Man. No. Thank goodness. Come on Fireman.

932
01:24:48,300 --> 01:24:57,000
Fireman stop it. Fireman no. No Fireman. Do what you can. No. Oh no.

933
01:24:57,000 --> 01:25:05,020
It's the green screen versus Quiet Man.

934
01:25:05,020 --> 01:25:10,520
How many eliminations has the green screen done?

935
01:25:10,520 --> 01:25:17,579
This is like 12 eliminations. Is he gonna throw him over the ropes

936
01:25:17,579 --> 01:25:24,630
right now? There's no way. I can't. I would be so

937
01:25:24,630 --> 01:25:31,590
shocked if the Quiet Man eliminates the green screen. What?

938
01:25:31,590 --> 01:25:35,430
Oh that's it. That's gonna be it. That's it. The winner of the 2018

939
01:25:35,430 --> 01:25:42,470
Rumble is the green screen. I can't believe it. He destroyed

940
01:25:42,470 --> 01:25:49,319
everybody. It wasn't even a chance. Nobody had a chance.

941
01:25:49,319 --> 01:26:02,340
Not. Nobody could even match his strength.

942
01:26:02,340 --> 01:26:13,319
The green screen. There you go. Yep. See you at WrestleMania. This is

943
01:26:13,319 --> 01:26:19,319
WrestleMania. He lasted a very very long time too.

944
01:26:19,319 --> 01:26:24,390
That was so long. He was like number one. Like 11 or 12

945
01:26:24,390 --> 01:26:26,630
or something. He stayed in the whole time.

946
01:26:26,710 --> 01:26:37,750
Holy shit. But it could be anybody. This could be

947
01:26:37,750 --> 01:26:51,479
anybody. Correct the timeline. I can't. That is the timeline.

948
01:26:51,479 --> 01:27:08,920
Fucking green screen. God damn it. All right. Well if I rematch it's not

949
01:27:08,920 --> 01:27:14,489
gonna randomize him again. I'm gonna have to just do another

950
01:27:14,489 --> 01:27:21,140
one. The green screen winning is worse than the pencil.

951
01:27:21,140 --> 01:27:26,789
I don't think that's true. All right. I'll do another one for fun.

952
01:27:26,789 --> 01:27:30,970
We'll do the encore here. Congratulations to the 2018

953
01:27:30,970 --> 01:27:38,310
Jermania Rumble for the green screen. At least it wasn't the quiet man.

954
01:27:38,310 --> 01:27:45,060
Oh thank god. There's nothing. I would have been

955
01:27:45,060 --> 01:27:56,920
so upset. All right. Let's just do another rumble.

956
01:27:56,920 --> 01:28:01,449
So this next one is not canon but it's just for fun. I guess we can

957
01:28:01,449 --> 01:28:09,590
throw. How about this? It's canon. No. The green

958
01:28:09,590 --> 01:28:18,420
screen wins. It's out of my hands. I can't fucking

959
01:28:18,420 --> 01:28:25,130
believe it. All right. Let me get this set up.

960
01:28:25,130 --> 01:28:37,979
Let's put the same people in at random. Show the stats of everybody.

961
01:28:37,979 --> 01:28:44,010
They're all very very similar. I'll show you. Hold on.

962
01:28:44,010 --> 01:28:49,510
I don't think the green screen has that high of

963
01:28:49,510 --> 01:28:53,270
stats. Yeah he doesn't. Lou has more stats than the green

964
01:28:53,270 --> 01:28:55,350
screen. Like we'll just put it that way.

965
01:28:55,350 --> 01:29:05,369
Like look. Lou is a hundred overall. Green screen is 92.

966
01:29:05,369 --> 01:29:12,680
Like you know what I mean? He's a fucking hundred. But everybody.

967
01:29:12,760 --> 01:29:20,489
I never put anybody under like 85. Like ever. Like 90. Because it's more fun

968
01:29:20,489 --> 01:29:22,890
that way. Because if you have. It doesn't really

969
01:29:22,890 --> 01:29:27,300
matter as much. Oh and it's 92. No they're all

970
01:29:27,300 --> 01:29:35,449
like in the 80s and 90s. What does Sandler have?

971
01:29:40,279 --> 01:29:45,460
Never mind. That's not true. He's 79.

972
01:29:45,460 --> 01:29:51,430
All right.

973
01:29:54,460 --> 01:30:05,909
All right. Let's get. Let's get everybody in here. See. Well binary man's 80.

974
01:30:05,909 --> 01:30:10,149
Yeah everybody's within like 80 to 100. 80 to 95.

975
01:30:10,149 --> 01:30:19,449
So then it's not like unfair for anybody. Fucking green screen.

976
01:30:19,449 --> 01:30:23,770
Gary the fuck up's 100. Well you. Yeah I don't know why he's stronger

977
01:30:23,770 --> 01:30:26,489
than Bill. He should not be stronger than Bill

978
01:30:26,489 --> 01:30:37,880
crazy. But he is apparently. Yeah 94. Except for Sandler. Well

979
01:30:37,880 --> 01:30:40,279
but you really want me to make Adam Sandler

980
01:30:40,359 --> 01:30:45,220
the strongest person. All right hold on. Let me get rid of you.

981
01:30:45,220 --> 01:30:52,539
Who's not in it? Wait I don't think. I don't think she was in it before.

982
01:30:52,539 --> 01:31:00,569
Oh you can be in there this time. Binary man. Binary man was so bad.

983
01:31:00,569 --> 01:31:06,069
Did you even get to see his face? Look at his face. He's got like.

984
01:31:06,069 --> 01:31:12,250
You can only have eight numbers of letters on a character.

985
01:31:12,250 --> 01:31:15,850
Green screens of weight and stats. Yeah but wouldn't that be the same

986
01:31:15,850 --> 01:31:20,729
thing with um like the labo and the the labo is

987
01:31:20,729 --> 01:31:26,409
the same stats. He I know for I am certain that he is like a super heavy

988
01:31:26,409 --> 01:31:32,039
weight. Bugleberry. I made him like four or five

989
01:31:32,039 --> 01:31:40,680
hundred pounds. Let's go here. But if you were just

990
01:31:40,680 --> 01:31:43,720
joining us for the the festivities there thank you for

991
01:31:43,720 --> 01:31:50,550
joining. There's a lot of people here. So thanks a lot. Thanks for sticking

992
01:31:50,550 --> 01:31:59,479
around. Now we're gonna do the the encore.

993
01:31:59,479 --> 01:32:10,869
Yeah but here they all are. Otto versus Jeremy.

994
01:32:10,869 --> 01:32:15,939
You have to see how it says random. Like I can't. I don't. You can do it.

995
01:32:15,939 --> 01:32:19,859
See entry order. I can do it. But that's not fun.

996
01:32:19,859 --> 01:32:23,239
I'd rather let the cards lie however they lie you know.

997
01:32:23,239 --> 01:32:35,670
Okay but look at these other wrestlers like

998
01:32:35,670 --> 01:32:53,579
73. 70. Come on man. Poor blue man. Blue man's never gonna win.

999
01:32:53,579 --> 01:32:59,479
Green screen first. But you can't. We can't do that.

1000
01:32:59,479 --> 01:33:03,479
I have to at least give the it's not random at that point.

1001
01:33:03,479 --> 01:33:13,539
All right we got red blend. Chris Jericho is not going to be in it.

1002
01:33:13,539 --> 01:33:24,619
Uh there's real faster. Sans. Yeah there was no bf. Do I deserve to

1003
01:33:24,619 --> 01:33:29,510
I didn't put myself in the rumble. I'm already there like three times. Do

1004
01:33:29,510 --> 01:33:40,810
I deserve to be there this time? All right I guess I deserve to be there

1005
01:33:40,810 --> 01:33:46,520
on the encore. It's not canon so it's fine.

1006
01:33:46,520 --> 01:33:52,550
Now these two these two aren't being in it Labo.

1007
01:33:52,630 --> 01:33:56,600
I don't know who the hell you are but you're not in it. Uh Jax.

1008
01:33:56,600 --> 01:34:00,340
I really thought he was gonna go far. Look at his stats. Come on.

1009
01:34:00,340 --> 01:34:09,779
Elvis is 88. Who eliminated Jax? Leave John Cena in.

1010
01:34:09,779 --> 01:34:21,420
All right John Cena can replace Elvis. Who the hell is John Cena?

1011
01:34:21,420 --> 01:34:25,260
That's so odd. Oh Chad Gable. Chris Jericho. Oh Kurt Hawkins.

1012
01:34:25,260 --> 01:34:30,710
Okay. DDP. Nice. Oh Dr Dan and Dr Don. You

1013
01:34:30,710 --> 01:34:47,939
belong in this universe. Where the hell is he? Seth Rollins.

1014
01:34:47,939 --> 01:34:56,279
Let's see. Where's John? Oh this is champions. Okay.

1015
01:34:56,279 --> 01:34:59,800
Jim. John Cena. Why the fuck am I putting him in this?

1016
01:34:59,800 --> 01:35:02,939
He's not even as strong as Jax. Why you don't even shouldn't even be here.

1017
01:35:02,939 --> 01:35:12,649
Adam Sandler stays. Be the very stays. All right uh poor wall dad.

1018
01:35:12,649 --> 01:35:23,609
How is pinwheel 96? Because it wouldn't have been fair.

1019
01:35:23,609 --> 01:35:27,369
If I made pinwheel like 10 and be 90

1020
01:35:27,369 --> 01:35:30,890
or 80 that match would you'd be able to say that's not fair.

1021
01:35:30,890 --> 01:35:37,500
I beat him as a fucking 90 plus. Uh Wally Wheat. Willem Dafoe.

1022
01:35:37,500 --> 01:35:44,100
Pinwheel. Okay. Yeah you're out of here.

1023
01:35:44,100 --> 01:35:47,939
Never allowed in another rumble ever again. All right so we put uh

1024
01:35:47,939 --> 01:35:55,260
Sweet Rhyne, Odd Michael, Magistank, or Fru Fru or Elvis.

1025
01:35:55,260 --> 01:35:59,460
Put pinwheel at 10. All right Sweet Rhyne.

1026
01:35:59,460 --> 01:36:02,420
So yeah the green screen's staying in. We can't just because they're all

1027
01:36:02,420 --> 01:36:09,979
powerful doesn't mean that they're impossible to overcome. All right

1028
01:36:09,979 --> 01:36:18,810
looks good. Uh yeah you can't do anything in a rumble.

1029
01:36:18,810 --> 01:36:22,329
Momentum is normal. Entrances are fine. Uh we could do

1030
01:36:22,329 --> 01:36:30,550
fast momentum. I usually put it on normal. Fast.

1031
01:36:30,550 --> 01:36:36,579
All right let's do it. All right let's go. Here's the encore rumble.

1032
01:36:36,579 --> 01:36:47,850
Let's see what happens. And then we'll do a um we'll do like a

1033
01:36:47,850 --> 01:36:51,050
hardcore like cage match or something with random people.

1034
01:36:57,380 --> 01:37:17,479
But that was a lot of fun. It always is. All right we already know how the rules

1035
01:37:17,479 --> 01:37:23,260
work. Skip. Can I skip? Oh yeah I forgot

1036
01:37:23,260 --> 01:37:26,380
John Cena is in the game. Well look I'm gonna get like another

1037
01:37:26,380 --> 01:37:30,890
drink. We'll we'll do another match or two.

1038
01:37:30,890 --> 01:37:34,970
Don't worry. All right I'll be right back. I'm gonna grab a drink.

1039
01:37:34,970 --> 01:37:37,689
Just let this play out. I don't even know. I'm not even gonna know who the

1040
01:37:37,689 --> 01:37:46,840
first two are so I'll be right back. Oh somebody said no Avril Lavigne. I

1041
01:37:46,840 --> 01:37:51,689
tried. The problem is you can't have uh

1042
01:37:52,250 --> 01:37:55,850
I'm pretty sure you can't have uh female and male wrestlers in the same ring at

1043
01:37:55,850 --> 01:38:01,289
the same time. I'm fairly certain about that.

1044
01:38:01,289 --> 01:38:05,479
Unless they changed it but I don't think they did because I couldn't do it.

1045
01:38:05,479 --> 01:38:09,399
So I tried. Avril Lavigne was supposed to be in place

1046
01:38:09,399 --> 01:38:14,949
of like one of the one of like the rain like the red blend like the

1047
01:38:14,949 --> 01:38:18,760
fucking wine. That was the last character by the

1048
01:38:18,760 --> 01:38:22,119
way. I just like I was oh shit I gotta have like a 36 person.

1049
01:38:22,119 --> 01:38:25,640
Oh come on. I don't want to see this. I'll be right back.

1050
01:38:25,640 --> 01:40:54,970
All right what I miss. Wait is this this entrance has been going off us so long?

1051
01:40:56,329 --> 01:41:00,100
This is all you've been seeing.

1052
01:41:05,859 --> 01:41:10,939
All right well here's the his alternate timeline.

1053
01:41:10,939 --> 01:41:15,590
Let's do it. Welcome to the encore rumble. B.F. Bilgerberri my favorite

1054
01:41:15,590 --> 01:41:18,710
character. Uh he's probably gonna get eliminated

1055
01:41:18,710 --> 01:41:25,699
in like 15 seconds. Here we go. And different camera angle for some

1056
01:41:25,699 --> 01:41:30,260
reason. That was nice. Can we get more cannon match?

1057
01:41:30,260 --> 01:41:33,220
No this is this is the alternate fucking timeline.

1058
01:41:33,220 --> 01:41:37,270
You know like civil war or marvel. How like

1059
01:41:37,270 --> 01:41:43,350
that did that happen in its own universe. Number three coming in is

1060
01:41:43,350 --> 01:41:51,159
Bill Krazy. Why do they wipe the dirt? I don't understand.

1061
01:41:51,159 --> 01:41:56,520
This is cannon. This is not cannon. It's not cannon because Bilgerberri

1062
01:41:56,520 --> 01:42:06,409
is gonna get eliminated first. And that just angers me. Bill Krazy

1063
01:42:06,409 --> 01:42:11,979
now has got pinwheel. Hopefully eliminating you first because

1064
01:42:11,979 --> 01:42:16,250
you're the worst character. So please get rid of pinwheel.

1065
01:42:16,250 --> 01:42:23,619
Get rid of him. Yes thank god. And are you sure you guys want this

1066
01:42:23,619 --> 01:42:26,100
cannon? Because beanbag sonic's coming in at number four. Are you sure you

1067
01:42:26,100 --> 01:42:29,619
want this to be cannon? You sure? Or do you want to write

1068
01:42:29,619 --> 01:42:33,300
your fan fiction where beanbag sonic wins and eliminates 29 people?

1069
01:42:33,300 --> 01:42:39,510
What the fuck? No no this is my favorite this is my favorite character.

1070
01:42:39,510 --> 01:42:44,810
Don't do it. Don't you fucking dare. Come on B.F.

1071
01:42:44,810 --> 01:42:50,500
Bugleberry. Pull a green screen. Yeah by the way I told you this already.

1072
01:42:50,500 --> 01:42:53,800
You'll be seeing this guy real fucking soon on Christmas.

1073
01:42:53,800 --> 01:43:00,020
Christmas spooktacular. Gonna be the scariest fucking Christmas scream you've

1074
01:43:00,020 --> 01:43:05,239
ever seen. Oh what a beautiful move by B.F.

1075
01:43:05,239 --> 01:43:09,500
Bugleberry. Quiet man coming in number five.

1076
01:43:09,500 --> 01:43:15,720
Thank god. Why would you roll to the outside of the ring? What are you

1077
01:43:15,720 --> 01:43:18,359
doing? Why would you ever do that? For what

1078
01:43:18,359 --> 01:43:22,439
reason? Bill Krazy is still taking punches

1079
01:43:22,439 --> 01:43:26,300
here for the quiet man. Going for his bird feet kick. The

1080
01:43:26,300 --> 01:43:29,659
claws there is gonna rip. I almost just set something really

1081
01:43:29,659 --> 01:43:32,460
fucked up. Let's just pretend let's just say we

1082
01:43:32,460 --> 01:43:37,739
kicked him. Dermaraptor coming in number six.

1083
01:43:37,739 --> 01:43:42,699
That guy back there is really excited in the white shirt.

1084
01:43:42,699 --> 01:43:48,300
Dermaraptor. Which by the way again next weekend is the movie night with

1085
01:43:48,300 --> 01:43:51,689
the green screen stuff. If you have a submission please go

1086
01:43:51,689 --> 01:43:54,649
check out the discord and check out the rules associated with

1087
01:43:54,649 --> 01:43:58,329
that. It's gonna be a lot of fun. I've already seen a couple submissions and

1088
01:43:58,329 --> 01:44:02,439
they are... What the fuck? That was crazy. This is

1089
01:44:02,439 --> 01:44:06,779
now canon. Just because of that. Like he's been

1090
01:44:06,779 --> 01:44:12,779
practicing for his YouTube channel. Here comes Garrett from the Sims

1091
01:44:12,779 --> 01:44:17,420
family house. I did that on the green screen. I did that

1092
01:44:17,420 --> 01:44:30,470
six days ago. That exact move. Nice reversal there by Garrett.

1093
01:44:30,470 --> 01:44:35,369
B.F. Bugleberry is still in. There goes the quiet man. Thank god.

1094
01:44:35,369 --> 01:44:38,090
If there was a straw poll right now he would be... Yeah there goes

1095
01:44:38,090 --> 01:44:43,260
Beanbag Sonic by B.F. Bugleberry. If I did a poll right now I think the

1096
01:44:43,260 --> 01:44:48,250
quiet man would be number one. Okay that...

1097
01:44:48,250 --> 01:44:51,930
What the hell was that? A lot of weird shit in this one. The

1098
01:44:51,930 --> 01:44:55,739
computer's trying to load a bunch of random things.

1099
01:44:55,739 --> 01:45:01,500
We get two Sims murder house. Nice recovery there by Chuck Schnozwell.

1100
01:45:01,500 --> 01:45:03,659
I mean they all hate each other so it makes sense of why they would be

1101
01:45:03,659 --> 01:45:09,130
fighting each other anyways. Belly to belly suplex. No he's

1102
01:45:09,130 --> 01:45:12,760
just kind of hugging him really tightly.

1103
01:45:12,760 --> 01:45:15,319
Not much you can do to build crazy that he has not done to himself

1104
01:45:15,319 --> 01:45:19,380
already. And Jerma Raptor's about to learn the hard way here. Well he's

1105
01:45:19,380 --> 01:45:22,859
gonna get scooped out and possibly thrown over by Bill Krazy.

1106
01:45:22,859 --> 01:45:26,380
Is it possible? Is he gonna get it done? B.F. Bugleberry now coming into

1107
01:45:26,380 --> 01:45:28,779
aid. Bill Krazy and they get it done.

1108
01:45:28,779 --> 01:45:34,859
Jerma Raptor is gone. Bugleberry showing lots of strength

1109
01:45:34,859 --> 01:45:38,380
here. He crossed arm. Check into Bill Krazy. After the

1110
01:45:38,380 --> 01:45:41,909
help I think it's time for me to fuck up your face.

1111
01:45:41,909 --> 01:45:49,029
Carvalet comes in. He's probably a little confused because this is the

1112
01:45:49,029 --> 01:45:54,359
second time that somebody has called in the last 30 minutes.

1113
01:45:54,359 --> 01:45:59,779
He keeps parking cars out there. By the way his entrance

1114
01:45:59,779 --> 01:46:03,689
is him riding it on a motorcycle and stopping. But you know you don't get to

1115
01:46:03,689 --> 01:46:08,789
see that because this is the rumble and it didn't make it. Number 10 is

1116
01:46:08,789 --> 01:46:14,569
Sands Undertale. He left after the last one. Yeah

1117
01:46:14,569 --> 01:46:16,460
we're just doing an encore one for fun.

1118
01:46:16,460 --> 01:46:20,380
That is now officially canon because Bill Krazy did a back flip so now

1119
01:46:20,380 --> 01:46:25,939
it's canon. Sands coming to number 10 and

1120
01:46:25,939 --> 01:46:29,779
probably instantly eliminated by Bill Krazy. Taunting is a bad move here.

1121
01:46:29,779 --> 01:46:36,539
Why would you do that? He did the Hulk Hogan and he kind of

1122
01:46:36,539 --> 01:46:44,039
looks like Hulk Hogan. I didn't intend that to happen but it just happened.

1123
01:46:44,039 --> 01:46:48,039
Otto the dog coming at number 11. Bugleberry looks like he's in...

1124
01:46:48,039 --> 01:46:56,899
No. Come on. Make this canon. Big suplex to Garrett from the Carvalet

1125
01:46:56,899 --> 01:47:01,689
from Sleeping Dogs. I thought that Bill Krazy was going

1126
01:47:01,689 --> 01:47:07,109
over the top ropes there but no. Big wow. Oh big wow. Otto is gone.

1127
01:47:07,109 --> 01:47:12,680
God damn it man. Can he catch a break? Bugleberry is top seat right

1128
01:47:12,720 --> 01:47:22,180
now. He didn't even get to take a second breath.

1129
01:47:22,180 --> 01:47:25,779
He inhaled, walked into the ring, got eliminated and then exhaled.

1130
01:47:25,779 --> 01:47:32,859
He didn't get to even breathe. Otto the dog is gone. Here comes Sweet Rind.

1131
01:47:32,859 --> 01:47:40,760
Still getting close to the halfway point on our

1132
01:47:40,760 --> 01:47:48,250
Marvel Ultimate alternate universe. Oh there goes the Carvalet Sweet Rind

1133
01:47:48,250 --> 01:47:51,609
with a big right head to punch. Throws him over. He's gone. Sorry if you

1134
01:47:51,609 --> 01:47:58,819
were betting on him. That was wild. Just swinging in

1135
01:47:58,819 --> 01:48:03,050
every direction was Bill Krazy. He didn't even care. He was just going

1136
01:48:03,050 --> 01:48:08,170
to hurt anybody that was near him. Powerbomb potentially over the top

1137
01:48:08,170 --> 01:48:10,810
ropes but to Sweet Rind from Bill Krazy. Are we going to see it?

1138
01:48:10,810 --> 01:48:15,380
Holy shit. That was dead happen twice. They both did it.

1139
01:48:15,380 --> 01:48:21,510
Bugleberry and Bill Krazy with the double.

1140
01:48:21,510 --> 01:48:29,189
In it comes John Cena. The chanting his name. Stop chanting his name.

1141
01:48:29,189 --> 01:48:34,039
Shut up everybody. Stop saying that. No. He's going to eliminate Chuck

1142
01:48:34,039 --> 01:48:38,949
Schnoswell. You happy about that? Is that what you guys want to see?

1143
01:48:38,949 --> 01:48:45,130
Don't say that. John Cena comes in. I forgot he was there. I thought there

1144
01:48:45,130 --> 01:48:49,020
was a mistake. I forgot I put him in here. Good.

1145
01:48:49,020 --> 01:48:53,399
The drop kick him over the top. Fireman coming in number 14.

1146
01:48:53,399 --> 01:48:57,960
B.F. Bugleberry has Bill Krazy now in a bad position. Fireman coming in

1147
01:48:57,960 --> 01:49:04,199
instead of 30 at 14. Yeah I want to see Fireman. I don't want to see

1148
01:49:04,199 --> 01:49:08,649
John Cena and now they both are working on Bill Krazy. There goes Bill

1149
01:49:08,729 --> 01:49:14,619
Krazy. He's out. Add him to the list of people eliminated by B.F.

1150
01:49:14,619 --> 01:49:18,250
Bugleberry. Right into the turnbuckle. Big

1151
01:49:18,250 --> 01:49:23,340
Fireman with an overhead throw. Throws over Chuck Schnoswell.

1152
01:49:23,340 --> 01:49:28,380
They're chanting some shit for John Cena.

1153
01:49:28,380 --> 01:49:33,079
Oh that's great. I'm so happy about this. Is he going to do a thing

1154
01:49:33,079 --> 01:49:34,520
where he puts a hand in front of his face

1155
01:49:34,520 --> 01:49:38,039
and like sneezes. Nice. The Hornet comes in with a big

1156
01:49:38,039 --> 01:49:44,199
right hand. Will the Hornet stay in for more than five seconds this time?

1157
01:49:44,199 --> 01:49:54,970
Maybe. Cena. John Cena. So here's the the question I have to ask you

1158
01:49:54,970 --> 01:50:00,329
guys. Is is it possible here that Fireman near

1159
01:50:00,329 --> 01:50:02,250
the Hornet. Can we get an up and smoke potential

1160
01:50:02,250 --> 01:50:07,500
scenario here? Glue Man coming in at 16. If you had one opportunity Glue Man

1161
01:50:07,500 --> 01:50:13,659
it's right now. Here's your shot. By the way I just

1162
01:50:13,659 --> 01:50:17,590
want to make this very clear. The Glue Man shirt will be back on sale

1163
01:50:17,590 --> 01:50:20,229
here. Oh.

1164
01:50:20,710 --> 01:50:25,029
Whoa. Not gonna waste any time. Get rid of Cena too.

1165
01:50:25,029 --> 01:50:29,159
Fire yourself up man. Come on. Get rid of Cena.

1166
01:50:29,159 --> 01:50:34,649
Bingo. That's a double elimination too from Glue Man. He's like fuck this man

1167
01:50:34,649 --> 01:50:37,050
if this is gonna be canon. I'm gonna make this shit canon.

1168
01:50:37,050 --> 01:50:45,189
I'm gonna win this shit. Red Blend wine coming in.

1169
01:50:45,189 --> 01:50:52,279
Will Glue Man and Bugleberry make this canon? I wonder. That was odd.

1170
01:50:52,279 --> 01:50:58,630
But nice work. Red Blend. Let me go ahead and.

1171
01:50:58,630 --> 01:51:05,829
Ah. Glue Man with a reversal to Red Blend. The best kind of wine you can

1172
01:51:05,909 --> 01:51:10,729
drink. It actually is. A lot of wines are gross. Red

1173
01:51:10,729 --> 01:51:16,170
Blend is the best of all red wines. Highly recommended. You're a

1174
01:51:16,170 --> 01:51:21,699
fucking weirdo. I know that's not even true. That's not true.

1175
01:51:21,699 --> 01:51:24,659
All right come on Bugleberry. Throw him over. Here comes the Greenscreen.

1176
01:51:24,659 --> 01:51:36,789
Greenscreen stuck on the ropes. No. Fuck you Greenscreen.

1177
01:51:36,789 --> 01:51:40,550
No. He ruined another one. He ruined another rumble.

1178
01:51:40,550 --> 01:51:44,279
He ruined another one. He's stuck on the ropes

1179
01:51:44,279 --> 01:51:55,180
and he can't even game crashed. He's like if I ain't winning I'm bringing

1180
01:51:55,180 --> 01:52:06,060
the whole fucking thing to the ground. I love and hate this. I fucking hate

1181
01:52:06,060 --> 01:52:08,380
this because we were in the middle of this. Like it was

1182
01:52:08,380 --> 01:52:13,350
we were doing something. Fuck the Greenscreen.

1183
01:52:16,380 --> 01:52:20,380
Now it has to be canon. All you guys that were so upset about this.

1184
01:52:20,380 --> 01:52:23,340
What what would you have me do about this? You understand?

1185
01:52:23,340 --> 01:52:27,020
What am I supposed to do about this? It's that he wins.

1186
01:52:27,020 --> 01:52:42,069
I'm sorry. Rewatch it. I can't even get out of here. I'm

1187
01:52:42,069 --> 01:53:06,680
stuck in here. My computer is hard locked. The

1188
01:53:06,680 --> 01:53:08,680
Greenscreen is about to turn the stream off.

1189
01:53:08,680 --> 01:53:15,180
You understand? That's unfucking believable.

1190
01:53:15,180 --> 01:53:22,810
Hold on. No. Oh wait wait wait. I got it. I got it.

1191
01:53:22,810 --> 01:53:28,310
No I don't. I have access to my mouse but I can't

1192
01:53:28,310 --> 01:53:35,779
force quit the game. Oh my god. I can't do anything. It's stuck here

1193
01:53:35,779 --> 01:53:39,100
forever. There's nothing I can do. I have to

1194
01:53:43,939 --> 01:53:47,300
control alt delete. I can't see the task manager because it's behind the

1195
01:53:47,300 --> 01:53:56,649
game. Hold on. Can I pull it up from here?

1196
01:53:56,649 --> 01:54:01,770
No I can't. Alt tap. Yeah alt tap doesn't do anything. Hold on wait wait.

1197
01:54:01,770 --> 01:54:10,810
Come on come on come on. No I can't do anything. It's fucked.

1198
01:54:10,810 --> 01:54:24,489
I am forced quitting the game right now and it's not doing anything.

1199
01:54:24,489 --> 01:54:32,220
Why? Of all things. I can't get out of it.

1200
01:54:32,220 --> 01:54:39,529
Start a new desktop. Put windows into a shutdown then

1201
01:54:39,529 --> 01:54:45,750
force the exe to stop. Yeah but then the computer turns off.

1202
01:54:45,750 --> 01:54:50,619
Now let me try this. Control Windows D. What does that do?

1203
01:54:50,619 --> 01:55:00,760
Hold on. No. Oh the whole thing's fucked.

1204
01:55:00,760 --> 01:55:05,210
Physically remove your hard drive from your computer. If I could just get the

1205
01:55:05,210 --> 01:55:08,170
task manager to like hold on. What if I do this?

1206
01:55:08,170 --> 01:55:11,449
I gotta make one of my other monitors the main display.

1207
01:55:11,449 --> 01:55:18,619
How the fuck can I even do that without seeing it?

1208
01:55:18,619 --> 01:55:24,100
Uh oh. Did I get it? Oh god what the fuck have I done?

1209
01:55:25,380 --> 01:55:36,090
Oh god what's happening? Oh boy this is not good.

1210
01:55:36,090 --> 01:55:41,460
Come on. Did I get it? Come on let me get it. Right here.

1211
01:55:41,460 --> 01:55:56,229
Get over here. Fuck. I can't do it. Why?

1212
01:55:56,229 --> 01:55:59,989
Well I'm gonna have to like turn off the screen.

1213
01:55:59,989 --> 01:56:09,720
I can't even see chat anymore. Force quitting it doesn't do anything.

1214
01:56:09,720 --> 01:56:18,550
Fucking green screen. God damn it. No I refuse to give up. What is this?

1215
01:56:18,550 --> 01:56:30,760
Hold on. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. This is bad. I'll be right. I'll be. Hold on. I'll be

1216
01:56:30,760 --> 01:57:11,930
right back. Hey. How are you doing?

1217
01:57:11,930 --> 01:57:20,140
Yeah I had to force boot my computer. That's canon. I'm not

1218
01:57:20,140 --> 01:57:22,380
changing it. There's no way. How can I change that now? We can do

1219
01:57:22,380 --> 01:57:33,050
another one? I mean at this point

1220
01:57:33,050 --> 01:57:39,989
that's the way it is. Let's do it. Let's do something different. Let's do

1221
01:57:39,989 --> 01:57:42,649
another one. Let's do like uh instead of a rumble.

1222
01:57:42,649 --> 01:57:48,649
The universe is making me not do one. So let's do uh

1223
01:57:48,649 --> 01:57:52,729
let's do like a hardcore cage match or something with

1224
01:57:52,729 --> 01:58:02,039
random characters. Hell in a cell. Let's do hell in a cell.

1225
01:58:02,039 --> 01:58:06,039
Green screen versus me in backstage rumble. I'm gonna lose. It's gonna crash

1226
01:58:06,039 --> 01:58:23,689
the game. All these fucking people. Jesus Christ.

1227
01:58:23,689 --> 01:58:26,970
All right. Are we talking about like alternate me or

1228
01:58:26,970 --> 01:58:36,359
or actual like old shitty me? Does anybody know what that picture is from?

1229
01:58:37,050 --> 01:58:47,989
Please tell me you do. Yeah that's from twitter.

1230
01:58:50,680 --> 01:58:57,460
All right let's do. See I'm 97. Yeah I do low blows. I'm an asshole. All

1231
01:58:57,460 --> 01:59:00,489
right. Let's see if I can take the green

1232
01:59:00,489 --> 01:59:04,659
screen down once and for all. See 90. Look everyone that was talking

1233
01:59:04,659 --> 01:59:08,100
shit about how the green screen is so powerful. You made the green screen to

1234
01:59:08,100 --> 01:59:15,750
see 92 versus 97. 92. He's not that good. There are

1235
01:59:15,750 --> 01:59:19,899
people that are like eight points higher than him. He's

1236
01:59:19,899 --> 01:59:25,420
too big. No he's not. Look at the labo. Labo. Okay

1237
01:59:25,420 --> 01:59:30,340
the labo is just as big just as heavy in 95.

1238
01:59:30,340 --> 01:59:34,420
And uh also by the way sweet rind is 92 and bigger.

1239
01:59:34,420 --> 01:59:44,140
He's bigger than the green screen. Hold on. How is the green screen

1240
01:59:44,140 --> 01:59:50,840
a super heavyweight? And nobody else? Do I have is he the only super heavyweight?

1241
01:59:50,840 --> 02:00:03,619
How? How does that make any sense? Why is he a super heavyweight?

1242
02:00:03,699 --> 02:00:07,909
There's another. There's another super heavyweight. All right I'm fucking kicking

1243
02:00:07,909 --> 02:00:13,239
this guy's ass. He has poison mist. It's green. I

1244
02:00:13,239 --> 02:00:18,329
figured maybe he was going to spit out green mist and it'd be funny.

1245
02:00:18,329 --> 02:00:21,050
All right let's go. Backstage brawl. I'm gonna kick the

1246
02:00:21,050 --> 02:00:26,069
fucking green screen's ass. Even as like old 33 year old shit

1247
02:00:26,069 --> 02:00:33,670
germa. The green screen has to be big. He's

1248
02:00:33,670 --> 02:00:45,399
huge. He's the size of a wall. Let's. Oh god. And here's the

1249
02:00:45,399 --> 02:00:48,920
worst part about this. This is very keyable. You could

1250
02:00:48,920 --> 02:00:52,039
you could put whatever you want there. So now I just fucked myself for like

1251
02:00:52,039 --> 02:01:00,420
another four years. Come on get up and fight him. Get up

1252
02:01:00,420 --> 02:01:05,260
and do anything. Do something. No don't let him beat you like

1253
02:01:05,260 --> 02:01:18,260
this. Somebody has to beat the green screen.

1254
02:01:18,260 --> 02:01:23,239
There it is. Oh he tripped. It's a little slippery over here.

1255
02:01:23,239 --> 02:01:25,939
All right let's go into the bathroom. I'm gonna like flush you down the

1256
02:01:25,939 --> 02:01:33,979
toilet. What? Oh no. No. We're going to the

1257
02:01:34,060 --> 02:01:39,640
tv. There's a desk. There's a table. Raw.

1258
02:01:39,640 --> 02:01:45,340
Come on reverse it germa. No get back in here. There's so much more interesting

1259
02:01:45,340 --> 02:01:48,810
shit in here. God this is gonna turn like Scooby

1260
02:01:48,810 --> 02:01:54,060
Doo isn't it? All right into the tv. Just like

1261
02:01:54,060 --> 02:02:08,170
nice. Nice lariat. Who the fuck is that?

1262
02:02:08,170 --> 02:02:14,199
Who is this lady? What? Are we in somebody's office?

1263
02:02:14,199 --> 02:02:19,800
Oh no not the chair. Oh not the chair green screen. Come on.

1264
02:02:19,800 --> 02:02:28,649
This is nothing he's had enough already. Somebody said this is a porn intro.

1265
02:02:28,649 --> 02:02:32,649
Just key out the green screen. Can somebody please do that?

1266
02:02:32,649 --> 02:02:36,329
For the green screen stream next weekend. Key this fucking guy out of

1267
02:02:36,329 --> 02:02:40,569
here. What? No don't do it.

1268
02:02:40,569 --> 02:02:51,800
No. I'm still alive. I'm still alive.

1269
02:02:51,800 --> 02:02:58,180
I'm persevering. That's one thing I got guarantee for you.

1270
02:02:58,180 --> 02:03:01,300
It didn't break. I don't weigh enough for it to break.

1271
02:03:01,300 --> 02:03:16,199
I'm like 148 pounds. No put him through it. Pick him up germa. You can do it.

1272
02:03:16,199 --> 02:03:22,100
Do something. Punch him. Throw him. Throw him through the tv.

1273
02:03:22,100 --> 02:03:26,819
No don't. Not me. Oh my god. I tripped over the chair that was in the way.

1274
02:03:26,819 --> 02:03:32,729
Seriously. This is just sad. I'm just it's like

1275
02:03:32,729 --> 02:03:45,239
I'm just getting bullied right now. I feel bad about this whole thing.

1276
02:03:45,239 --> 02:03:52,149
Nobody can stop him. I lost. That's it. The game's over.

1277
02:03:52,149 --> 02:03:59,609
No it's not. Stay alive. Just fucking electrocute him.

1278
02:03:59,609 --> 02:04:02,569
Just like hitman style. Walk him into water and fucking throw

1279
02:04:02,569 --> 02:04:27,619
throw like a toaster at him. Come on. No. I got a better idea. I know who can

1280
02:04:27,619 --> 02:04:57,909
fucking stop this motherfucker. Now you're fucked. You're dead. I'm

1281
02:04:57,909 --> 02:05:00,710
channeling my Jecks. I beat Jebel first try guys.

1282
02:05:00,710 --> 02:05:10,010
I beat Jebel first try. You want me to first try this guy too?

1283
02:05:10,010 --> 02:05:16,840
Turn on the Jecks. A little bit taller. Yeah.

1284
02:05:17,079 --> 02:05:26,069
Push him. Come on. No. Come on. This is like the

1285
02:05:26,069 --> 02:05:30,949
this is my like ultimate character. You can't get embarrassed right now.

1286
02:05:30,949 --> 02:05:35,720
Oh my fucking lord. Don't get embarrassed.

1287
02:05:35,720 --> 02:05:46,500
Kick his ass. All the germas fail to the green screen.

1288
02:05:46,500 --> 02:05:50,039
No. That's not gonna happen. Jecks is gonna come back

1289
02:05:50,039 --> 02:06:01,060
and he's gonna hit him in the head with an iron.

1290
02:06:01,060 --> 02:06:07,880
He's a fucking hundred. You can't have better stats than Jecks.

1291
02:06:07,880 --> 02:06:11,079
Who's ironing? I'll open up a closet and find one.

1292
02:06:11,079 --> 02:06:15,100
I don't need to have an I'll find an iron. All right wipe the floor with

1293
02:06:15,100 --> 02:06:19,479
them Jecks. Come on. Why would you walk with them? You

1294
02:06:19,479 --> 02:06:28,899
can't toy with the green screen. End him. That's not it right? Okay

1295
02:06:28,899 --> 02:06:38,810
we're good. Come on. Come back here. Nice. Nice.

1296
02:06:38,810 --> 02:06:49,430
Very good. Very good. Why do I care this much about this?

1297
02:06:49,430 --> 02:06:57,050
I'm so upset with the green screen. Somebody has to beat him.

1298
02:06:57,130 --> 02:07:02,579
Where are you taking me? Where are we going now? Oh my god. I tripped over the

1299
02:07:02,579 --> 02:07:08,500
speed bump. Give me a break. That's not a Jecks move.

1300
02:07:08,500 --> 02:07:18,899
What the fuck? There are attendants? There's a truck?

1301
02:07:18,899 --> 02:07:22,760
Go to the car. Can we like run somebody over with the car? I will lose

1302
02:07:22,760 --> 02:07:26,789
my mind if that happens. If Jecks like gets in the car and

1303
02:07:26,789 --> 02:07:37,399
runs him over, I'll die on screen. You'll see me die on screen.

1304
02:07:37,399 --> 02:07:42,140
Come on. Twist the elbow. He's like no I can't take that.

1305
02:07:42,140 --> 02:07:45,319
There it is. There's the Jeremy Elbrittson family line.

1306
02:07:45,319 --> 02:07:48,819
I grab your wrist. I fall down. You fall down.

1307
02:07:48,819 --> 02:07:52,779
That's been for generations. My father taught me that. You want to fuck

1308
02:07:52,779 --> 02:07:55,260
somebody up in a fight? Just grab with two hands their

1309
02:07:55,260 --> 02:07:57,659
fucking wrist and fall down as hard as you can.

1310
02:07:57,659 --> 02:08:05,500
You're gonna fuck him up. Guaranteed. Break his neck.

1311
02:08:05,500 --> 02:08:09,960
Snap his neck. Come on Jecks. Snap his fucking neck.

1312
02:08:09,960 --> 02:08:24,859
Ugh. Come on. What? Give me a break. And watch out for the electricity.

1313
02:08:24,859 --> 02:08:38,579
No. No. Don't. Did I die? Is that? What? No. No.

1314
02:08:38,579 --> 02:08:51,130
No. No. Come on. There's no way. I got fucking electrocuted. The thing

1315
02:08:51,130 --> 02:08:57,529
that I said I wanted to do to him, he does to me. And I'm still alive.

1316
02:08:57,529 --> 02:09:09,640
You can't stop, Jecks. Even with electrocution.

1317
02:09:09,640 --> 02:09:13,340
Get over to the cars. I want to see a car death.

1318
02:09:18,329 --> 02:09:23,640
We need super Jecks. Should I make super Jecks?

1319
02:09:23,640 --> 02:09:30,359
Just make them like seven feet tall. Just turn them like green and make them

1320
02:09:30,359 --> 02:09:40,069
like fucking eight feet tall. Why is this turning into a DBZ timeline?

1321
02:09:40,069 --> 02:09:55,560
Oh I can't beat him as regular Jecks. I have to go super Jecks.

1322
02:09:55,560 --> 02:10:32,060
That's it. No. That's not it. What? No. Don't taunt. What are you doing?

1323
02:10:32,060 --> 02:10:34,569
What the fuck? Did we just watch?

1324
02:10:51,140 --> 02:10:55,670
Oh my fucking back hurts. I thought I won and he's...

1325
02:10:59,930 --> 02:11:09,260
It's time to bring in Adam Sandler. Fuck it. We're going with the real. The real. S-tier.

1326
02:11:19,109 --> 02:11:30,569
Fucking Adam Sandler. Where is he? Somebody. Come on. He's 79. He sucks.

1327
02:11:37,340 --> 02:11:43,000
Let's go. Come on, Sandler. If it doesn't work, we're gonna combine Jecks and Sandler.

1328
02:11:43,640 --> 02:11:49,350
We're gonna make super Adam Sandler Jecks. All right. Come on, Sandler.

1329
02:11:49,350 --> 02:11:53,779
It's always backstage. I wonder what's gonna happen. He's gonna push him and he's gonna punch

1330
02:11:53,779 --> 02:12:10,460
in the face. Why did I think this was gonna work? He's gonna break his neck.

1331
02:12:25,829 --> 02:12:29,609
He's gonna kill him. We just sent Adam Sandler to his death.

1332
02:12:31,109 --> 02:12:34,310
This wasn't even an attempt. He's 79 and he's a piece of shit.

1333
02:12:35,109 --> 02:12:41,640
Oh, I really thought he was gonna snap his neck right there. I was about to fucking lose my mind.

1334
02:12:44,069 --> 02:12:54,409
Electrocute. Sandler, electrocute. Sandler, use electrocute. No, don't get electrocuted.

1335
02:12:54,409 --> 02:13:04,460
Oh my god. Come on, fight back. Use the Metacritic score of your last six movies

1336
02:13:05,100 --> 02:13:24,310
to combine until like 72 percent. God damn it, man. I'm gonna die. Where are you taking him? This

1337
02:13:24,310 --> 02:13:30,680
is just bad. Take him into the car. Powerbomb Adam Sandler through the roof of the car

1338
02:13:31,770 --> 02:13:36,649
and I will piss my pants. People come out of my fucking penis. It just, that will happen.

1339
02:13:38,520 --> 02:13:44,409
Oh, what a reversal. Holy shit. That was an absolute, that was a beautiful reversal.

1340
02:13:45,050 --> 02:13:57,239
Oh, come on. Don't let that be the end. Is that the end? It always ends right here. Can

1341
02:13:57,239 --> 02:14:03,859
we not end in the fucking hallway? Uh, excuse me. Excuse me attendant. Fire extinguisher. Get it.

1342
02:14:05,479 --> 02:14:07,960
Sandler, if you're smart, you're gonna get that fire extinguisher and you're gonna throw it

1343
02:14:07,960 --> 02:14:17,960
in his face. Nice. Come on. He did it. Is that it? No, it's never it. He's like,

1344
02:14:17,960 --> 02:14:28,119
it's like Michael Myers, man. You can't taunt before. These really are like Microsoft

1345
02:14:28,119 --> 02:14:41,369
3D movie maker sound effects. Get out to the cars. At least finish it on the cars, guys.

1346
02:14:42,310 --> 02:14:56,140
Nice parry. No, don't take him back here. Uh, I'll tell you one thing. Green screen is slow

1347
02:14:56,140 --> 02:15:04,220
to get up. Now where are we going? All the way down this hallway. Wherever the hell this is,

1348
02:15:04,220 --> 02:15:11,260
he's doing the, I'm gonna end this taunt. Uh, that's it. He's gonna taunt. While he's

1349
02:15:11,260 --> 02:15:15,659
lying on the ground, you had an opportunity there. Nice job. This is a fucking idiot.

1350
02:15:16,220 --> 02:15:31,399
This is three matches in a row. He's tired. And now people are booing. I don't blame them.

1351
02:15:31,399 --> 02:15:42,220
I would be booing too. Come on, Sandler. Now is it over? What's going on with his legs?

1352
02:15:43,670 --> 02:15:50,539
He's prepping up like a finishing move. No, he does it every time and he wins with that

1353
02:15:50,539 --> 02:16:20,260
every time. What are you doing? Adam Sandler is fine. No, he's not. Break his leg. Get up.

1354
02:16:20,899 --> 02:16:30,840
Don't get choked out. Oh my God. Look, he's limp. Did you see that leg? Did you see how

1355
02:16:30,840 --> 02:16:37,590
fucked up that was? This is bad. Adam Sandler is limp right now. This is just fucking sad.

1356
02:16:38,969 --> 02:17:05,459
Sadler. And with that, a reversal. He's not gonna be Adam Sandler for all. Come on,

1357
02:17:05,459 --> 02:17:12,569
Sandler. He's got him in the chokeslip. This is his finishing move. Do it. Holy shit.

1358
02:17:12,569 --> 02:17:31,610
Did he win? He wins, right? Come on. At the Sandler chokeslip. Dude, no. I can't. This is

1359
02:17:31,610 --> 02:17:49,059
going on for a long time. I'm gonna fucking die. I need to stop. I need to like look away

1360
02:17:49,059 --> 02:18:30,729
from the screen. What did he do? Break his neck. Oh, what a fucking recovery. Oh my God.

1361
02:18:32,729 --> 02:18:42,600
I need to stop. I need to stop looking at the screen. This is fucking stupid.

1362
02:18:52,139 --> 02:19:07,299
All right, it's time. It's time to make super jacks. Fuck this guy. Are you kidding me?

1363
02:19:28,170 --> 02:19:33,780
It's time to overclock me. What? Why is it Willem Dafoe? I don't know. Okay. All right.

1364
02:19:34,340 --> 02:19:43,940
It's time to make fucking super jacks. Let's fucking power him up. You know what I mean?

1365
02:19:43,940 --> 02:20:01,500
Like feed him up. Like 640 pounds. Inject him. There you go. Right here. Fucking inject him.

1366
02:20:04,870 --> 02:20:14,170
It actually will be unfucking beatable. Thick ass neck too. You know what I mean? Right there.

1367
02:20:21,340 --> 02:20:28,819
So many muscles in the back that it's actually like it looks bad. Yep. An incredibly defined

1368
02:20:28,819 --> 02:20:36,790
chest. Washboard abs. Look at this shit. That looks gross because it's so good.

1369
02:20:42,569 --> 02:20:53,590
Fucking veins everywhere. We are meticulously making a creature, a person that will

1370
02:20:53,590 --> 02:21:02,200
absolutely never be beaten. Ever. Give him a nice ass too. No, no, no, no. It's gonna be like a

1371
02:21:02,200 --> 02:21:15,530
fatter one. What? What the fuck am I talking about? No. There we go. No, no, no, no. Where

1372
02:21:15,530 --> 02:21:24,260
were they? Where were they? The huge ones. The fucking Thanksgiving turkey legs. And we're gonna

1373
02:21:24,260 --> 02:21:30,889
make them glow. It's gonna be obnoxious how much he glows. Look at these. Nobody has legs

1374
02:21:30,889 --> 02:21:47,190
like this. And put oil all over his body so it's slippery and shit. Look at that. We're not even

1375
02:21:47,190 --> 02:22:38,409
done. Fucking RGB glasses. Look at those. Those are like a thousand dollars. Make them fucking

1376
02:22:38,409 --> 02:23:11,899
shine. Gold? No shirt. Okay fine. Fuck it. Material? Gold. Gold and shining. And he's

1377
02:23:11,899 --> 02:23:35,500
gonna be a hundred in every stat. 100. Gold hair too? Oh you better believe it. And he's

1378
02:23:35,579 --> 02:23:50,729
getting fucking DBZ hair. Yeah, fuck this material. If it ain't glowing and gold, I don't want it.

1379
02:23:50,729 --> 02:24:18,250
And that's maximum gold intensity. Look at that shit. He looks fucking absolutely fabulous.

1380
02:24:18,250 --> 02:24:41,989
All right. Now it's time for the hair. Macaroni pants? You thought I was kidding. We're

1381
02:24:41,989 --> 02:25:11,610
actually doing like the Super Saiyan hair. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Hold on. Excuse me.

1382
02:25:11,610 --> 02:25:25,899
And, and he's getting an infinity gauntlet. This, I want to make sure he fucking wins

1383
02:25:25,899 --> 02:26:01,450
guaranteed. We can only have one stone. The power stone. That's the only fucking one that

1384
02:26:01,450 --> 02:26:15,989
matters anyways. Give him two infinity gauntlets. Okay. Was it the mind stone? What's the,

1385
02:26:15,989 --> 02:26:21,659
what's the other most expensive fucking thing in the world? Expensive. I mean,

1386
02:26:21,659 --> 02:26:30,250
you know what I'm saying. It's blue, right? Give him a sans eye. I can't give him a sans

1387
02:26:30,250 --> 02:26:40,040
eye. I can't make a sans eye. This, no, I don't have a, I can't make a sans eye.

1388
02:26:42,489 --> 02:27:36,010
Sans eye. Sans eye. Sans eye. Close enough. Wrong eye. Well he can have it in both eyes.

1389
02:27:39,190 --> 02:27:45,670
No, I can't do wrong. I can't change the eye. Do you understand? It's only that. That's it.

1390
02:27:45,670 --> 02:28:03,989
That's your sans eye. You can. What do you mean you can? How? It's only that one on the one

1391
02:28:03,989 --> 02:28:11,610
side. Sunglasses. Go back. Well, how would I, what, okay. I'll make them sans glasses.

1392
02:28:11,610 --> 02:28:40,579
Okay. There. That's fucking sans glasses. I think he's ready. Two infinity gauntlets,

1393
02:28:40,579 --> 02:28:44,840
two sans eyes. Super Saiyan. And he's fucking seven and a half feet tall.

1394
02:28:44,840 --> 02:29:06,889
Put Jax across. Okay. Jax across the chest. I'll write Jax across his chest. That's a good

1395
02:29:06,889 --> 02:29:24,299
idea. And fucking, like, blood. Now, you know what else he's gonna fucking have?

1396
02:29:24,299 --> 02:30:13,020
He's gonna channel fucking Beanbag Sonic. No, that, there's a reason why I didn't put him

1397
02:30:13,020 --> 02:31:26,629
in the game. You understand? Now I have it on my chest. That means it's fucking real.

1398
02:31:26,629 --> 02:31:35,780
Okay. Blood. All right. I need the glow. That's right. I need the glow. No, not Q.

1399
02:31:35,780 --> 02:32:13,670
Q Jax. What? Q Jax. Quadruple Jax. It's done. Now let's go to the most important part.

1400
02:32:13,670 --> 02:32:25,370
100 in every single step. Every single one. As high as I can get it. Minecraft logo. Well,

1401
02:32:25,370 --> 02:32:49,700
that's an incredibly powerful thing. The presentation name. V. Oh, from Boston.

1402
02:32:49,700 --> 02:33:01,620
Leg power. Grappling everything at 100. Every single thing. If there's not something at max,

1403
02:33:01,620 --> 02:33:16,059
then there's a problem. V for vengeance. Mic performance. What a stupid stat. He is 100.

1404
02:33:16,620 --> 02:33:25,829
Abilities. Give him fucking everything. Skills. He's already got like, they all have that

1405
02:33:25,909 --> 02:33:39,639
anyways. Okay, I'm ready. New screen pose. That's pretty good. With the two infinity gauntlets.

1406
02:33:41,690 --> 02:33:55,139
Level three. Level three. Level three. Hold on, wait. Let's get the pose. Level one. Level,

1407
02:33:56,020 --> 02:34:24,920
level three. Let's see it. All level three. You can't have everything level three.

1408
02:34:24,920 --> 02:34:37,319
Let's watch the absolute destruction of the green screen. All level three. Hold on. Where is

1409
02:34:37,319 --> 02:35:16,760
he? Oh, that's great. 100 everything. Okay, let's do this. Everything level three.

1410
02:35:17,690 --> 02:35:23,340
Literal god. And the payback is, look at this. Teleport behind your opponent. Uh, sure.

1411
02:35:24,139 --> 02:35:57,219
Instant recovery. The buff enhances your buff. Save it. Let's go. He's ready. All right,

1412
02:35:57,219 --> 02:36:01,700
now let's play, uh, what's that song from, uh, what's that song from fucking my hero

1413
02:36:01,700 --> 02:36:22,200
academia? I don't like watch anime. I've watched like one. I've only seen one anime.

1414
02:36:22,200 --> 02:36:52,420
One-on-one. Backstage brawl. Super Jex. Good fucking luck. 92. Give me a break. Okay.

1415
02:37:09,379 --> 02:37:29,290
Acid base. Good call. That's a good call. Let me get it ready. What am I gonna chat?

1416
02:37:29,290 --> 02:37:45,829
We're gonna get to see Super Jex fucking just absolutely dunk on somebody. So here we go.

1417
02:37:48,709 --> 02:38:09,049
Let me make sure it's fucking loud enough. Come on, Super Jex. This is what you were made for.

1418
02:38:09,049 --> 02:38:17,530
You were created for this one fucking moment. Super Jex versus green screen. Oh,

1419
02:38:17,530 --> 02:38:21,690
you think you're tall? You think you're like as tall as me? I don't think so.

1420
02:38:21,690 --> 02:38:52,069
You wanna talk shit? Let's go. Super Jex. Come on, Super. No fucking way.

1421
02:38:52,870 --> 02:39:25,700
Come on, turn up Super Jex. Turn the fuck up. What? Dude, are you really gonna let

1422
02:39:25,700 --> 02:39:32,329
Adam Sandler do a better job than you? Give me a fucking break. Powerbomb him through glass table.

1423
02:39:33,049 --> 02:39:47,590
You got two infinity gauntlets. Two infinity gauntlets. That's 640 pounds. He's immutable.

1424
02:39:48,309 --> 02:40:04,090
He's unbeatable. Come on, Super Jex. Where are you taking him? Oh my god. He's only

1425
02:40:04,090 --> 02:40:08,329
fighting at 20%. No, I mean very clearly he's lit the fuck up at like 120%.

1426
02:40:08,329 --> 02:40:16,420
20%. This is the comeback right here. What are you doing? What? You just missed like four times.

1427
02:40:17,370 --> 02:40:25,270
You can't. What are you doing? Wait, why is the meme funeral about to play autoplay?

1428
02:40:33,780 --> 02:40:44,170
Meme funeral. That's a fucking. Break his neck. Break his fucking neck. Snap it.

1429
02:40:44,889 --> 02:40:58,500
Come on, Super Jex. Yes.

1430
02:41:16,809 --> 02:41:33,420
Oh, shut up. No, I don't. We did it. Super Jex. Timeline has been restored.

1431
02:41:36,219 --> 02:41:39,500
Now I need to make a super green screen.

1432
02:41:45,670 --> 02:41:46,170
No.

1433
02:41:53,350 --> 02:41:57,270
And then we gotta put him in a fucking hell in a cell. Oh god damn it. Why?

1434
02:42:11,909 --> 02:42:17,590
Hold on, I gotta duplicate it and make him gold.

1435
02:42:18,629 --> 02:42:22,250
And then I gotta put him in a hell in a cell. The ultimate battle.

1436
02:42:24,069 --> 02:42:28,309
Look at how good that Willem Dafoe is. I'm sorry, that's fucking perfect.

1437
02:42:29,110 --> 02:42:47,979
What a perfect Willem Dafoe. He's as big as he can get. He's six. He already is there.

1438
02:42:50,569 --> 02:42:57,110
Make him a blue screen. Super gold screen. Well, no, he has to be a gold screen. Blue screen.

1439
02:42:58,170 --> 02:43:19,940
Oh god damn it. Sans blue screen. But forget about the Sans. Let's see. Gold.

1440
02:43:20,659 --> 02:43:36,409
He kind of has to be a gold screen. I mean, he just does. Blue or riot. Can he have a gold

1441
02:43:36,409 --> 02:43:56,459
head? Blue. Can he have like a gold face? This is going to be unbearable to look at.

1442
02:43:57,100 --> 02:44:06,329
This is going to be awful on the eyes. Gold X's. Okay, that makes sense.

1443
02:44:06,969 --> 02:44:18,809
Oh, that's gonna be a pain in the ass to put all those up. Jesus fucking christ.

1444
02:44:19,690 --> 02:44:37,700
It already, it already hurts my head. This is gonna take a long time.

1445
02:44:39,159 --> 02:44:42,600
If you guys are curious as to how long it makes to make a character, like just to make one.

1446
02:44:44,059 --> 02:44:53,909
I mean, you painstakingly go through and do this. That's not showing up well.

1447
02:44:53,909 --> 02:45:24,780
Maybe an orange will work. A dark orange with a gold look. It's just Dr. Manhattan.

1448
02:45:24,780 --> 02:45:32,549
That's what it's turning into. And then make Giga Sandler. We're going too deep, I think.

1449
02:45:35,319 --> 02:45:45,290
If I make the material different. Giga Sandler. I'll just make it darker blue.

1450
02:45:46,010 --> 02:46:03,379
That's the only way it's gonna work. That's okay. No, that's fine. It's glowing. In

1451
02:46:03,379 --> 02:46:08,020
every way the blue is a different looking blue, but because it's glowing. I wonder if

1452
02:46:08,020 --> 02:46:19,610
we can make it darker. Yes, we can. But I don't want to go to like purple though.

1453
02:46:22,090 --> 02:46:30,260
That looks good. That's the correct looking blue, I think. Remember, it is glowing. He looks like

1454
02:46:30,260 --> 02:46:35,930
a tube of toothpaste. I'm sorry. Well, it's fucking super green screen. You think I'm gonna

1455
02:46:35,930 --> 02:47:13,370
change his name? Super Sweet Rind. We're going too deep. That's too deep. That looks good.

1456
02:47:13,370 --> 02:47:26,940
I gotta fix the other one though. Giga Rind. You guys see how you can just get lost in

1457
02:47:26,940 --> 02:47:45,350
these games, right? What the fuck does that present even mean? What does that mean? What

1458
02:47:45,350 --> 02:47:57,670
does that even mean? I can't even, I don't know what that means. All right, that's fine. Wait,

1459
02:47:57,670 --> 02:48:12,969
is that the right color? Is that the right color? Now it is. There's so many X's on them.

1460
02:48:12,969 --> 02:48:48,870
I'm going as fast as I can. One, two, three, one, one, two, three, four, five. Thankfully,

1461
02:48:48,870 --> 02:48:53,959
it's already in place and I have to spend like an hour making this. It takes about

1462
02:48:53,959 --> 02:48:57,899
30 to, 30 minutes to an hour to make every character. Think about how easy they are.

1463
02:48:57,899 --> 02:49:06,139
So if you can imagine 36 characters, it was about 30 to 40 hours to make everything.

1464
02:49:06,139 --> 02:49:22,309
But I love it. I have so much fun just making weird shit. No, don't emboss it. I need to make

1465
02:49:22,309 --> 02:49:37,989
it glow, man. Material. There we go. Because even like this, this shit I'm doing right now,

1466
02:49:37,989 --> 02:49:44,340
you wouldn't imagine it would take long, but time just melts the fuck away. And this

1467
02:49:44,340 --> 02:49:57,319
shit is already here. And this guy is like a fairly simple person. Galoo Man God form.

1468
02:49:59,909 --> 02:50:02,790
Okay, that's all right. And then the one, the two in the back. Oh, he's got four in the

1469
02:50:02,790 --> 02:50:09,209
back, actually. Well, here's a little behind the scenes, how things work when you make

1470
02:50:09,209 --> 02:50:25,670
characters in these games. Fuck. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. One,

1471
02:50:25,670 --> 02:50:41,530
two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. Still angry that the game crashed when

1472
02:50:41,530 --> 02:50:46,139
he was doing, when Galoo Man was doing. I know. I don't know why that seems to happen

1473
02:50:46,139 --> 02:50:52,620
every time we do these. Blue screen of death, green screen. All right. Almost done.

1474
02:50:53,340 --> 02:51:07,159
Only two more. Thankfully, I'm familiar with the menus too, because I'd be like,

1475
02:51:07,159 --> 02:51:20,219
wait, where do I go? What, what, what, what does this do? Why is this headed there?

1476
02:51:20,219 --> 02:51:25,219
The head will be changed, don't worry. The head's gonna get changed. All right,

1477
02:51:25,219 --> 02:51:31,799
there's all the markers. Gold markers glowing. So now we're gonna go to the

1478
02:51:31,799 --> 02:51:41,340
head. Hands too, need to be changed. Edit them. That's fine. Make them glow.

1479
02:51:41,899 --> 02:51:58,899
And make them that blue. That matches pretty well. Good. Pretty good. Fucking

1480
02:51:58,899 --> 02:52:11,559
giga blue screen. That's it. Make his head the right color. He's already

1481
02:52:11,559 --> 02:52:19,780
glowing. That's good. Matches pretty well. I'm gonna change the material

1482
02:52:19,780 --> 02:52:22,340
though. No, I'm not. Because that would take the glow off. That's good.

1483
02:52:26,520 --> 02:52:36,420
He's so, he's so oily and shiny. All right, gonna do his feet. He's wearing

1484
02:52:36,420 --> 02:52:45,899
just green socks. That doesn't match. It's weird because sometimes you pick

1485
02:52:45,899 --> 02:52:51,319
the same color, but it just doesn't match. That's close enough, I think,

1486
02:52:51,319 --> 02:53:04,819
right here. Maybe a little bit darker. Oh, because it needs to be glowing,

1487
02:53:04,819 --> 02:53:16,790
right? All right, he's done. There's giga blue screen. I don't know.

1488
02:53:17,989 --> 02:53:22,420
There he is. Hair? I can't, I can't put hair on him.

1489
02:53:24,860 --> 02:53:33,020
Put Goku hair on him? I can't, I can't. I can't. Should I just take the mask off

1490
02:53:33,020 --> 02:53:40,819
and give him Goku hair? I can't. Hair can't go. Here's the most

1491
02:53:40,819 --> 02:53:47,540
infuriating thing about WWE since 2K14, okay? Here's a major complaint.

1492
02:53:51,030 --> 02:53:54,950
Half of the stuff for clothing and masks and face masks and head gear

1493
02:53:55,590 --> 02:53:57,909
is not compatible with half of the other stuff in the game.

1494
02:53:58,629 --> 02:54:02,709
So, for instance, look at this. Ready? Like, appearance, right? Even clothing.

1495
02:54:02,709 --> 02:54:05,270
Let me go to, like, upper body, for instance. And, like, oh, jackets.

1496
02:54:05,989 --> 02:54:09,350
So, like, there are a bunch of shit. Like, I can't put any of these on.

1497
02:54:10,680 --> 02:54:13,719
None of these can go on. See that in the lower left corner?

1498
02:54:15,030 --> 02:54:17,430
That means it can only be put on during an entrance.

1499
02:54:18,069 --> 02:54:22,250
Look at, let's, like, half the fucking list is unusable.

1500
02:54:23,559 --> 02:54:25,879
And then you run into the problem of, you see the ones with the,

1501
02:54:25,879 --> 02:54:30,520
these on the Xs here? See the lower left? I literally have to take off my mask to put

1502
02:54:30,520 --> 02:54:37,000
this jacket on. Oh, you want to put this shirt on? No, no, no, no. You have to take off the mask.

1503
02:54:38,520 --> 02:54:42,280
I don't, I don't understand why. More than half the options are not usable together.

1504
02:54:45,030 --> 02:54:50,520
And that's been happening since 2K14. It seems like 2K, whatever,

1505
02:54:50,520 --> 02:54:55,959
Yuke's and Visual Concepts, they're so concerned. They are so fucking concerned

1506
02:54:55,959 --> 02:55:00,620
about clipping that they make it so you can't customize the character.

1507
02:55:00,620 --> 02:55:04,860
Like, they're so scared that if I put this on, it's going to clip through the mask.

1508
02:55:04,860 --> 02:55:11,750
Who gives a shit? It limits so many of the, like, I'm like, oh, this is a cool,

1509
02:55:11,750 --> 02:55:14,469
look at this jacket, the puffy blue jacket, this exact thing.

1510
02:55:14,469 --> 02:55:17,590
Nope, can't use it, sorry. Move on. I can use this one, though.

1511
02:55:18,389 --> 02:55:22,629
It's the same reason why you can't put on, like, look at this.

1512
02:55:23,430 --> 02:55:27,659
Like, see, like, uh, like, torso accessories or something.

1513
02:55:27,659 --> 02:55:31,559
See, look, like, why can't I put this on? I can't put this on.

1514
02:55:32,120 --> 02:55:37,780
But I can put these on. Why? Is this, what?

1515
02:55:37,780 --> 02:55:41,620
I could put a fucking rubber ducky on for an entrance, but I can't put on a scarf.

1516
02:55:42,340 --> 02:55:47,979
I have to take off the mask. Put it on.

1517
02:55:55,190 --> 02:56:07,159
You see? See how dumb this is? Go back, go back.

1518
02:56:07,159 --> 02:56:11,079
Well, I, see, now, now, if I make that mistake, I have to put everything back on.

1519
02:56:13,420 --> 02:56:14,620
See? I have to go all the way back.

1520
02:56:16,649 --> 02:56:20,010
Neck accessories. What do we got for neck accessories in WWE?

1521
02:56:20,010 --> 02:56:23,450
Oh, oh, I can put headphones. No, you can't, no, you can't do that.

1522
02:56:24,090 --> 02:56:26,010
Oh, what about, no, sorry, you can't do that either.

1523
02:56:26,010 --> 02:56:31,829
Oh, um, oh, and all of these I can't use unless I'm on an entrance.

1524
02:56:31,829 --> 02:56:33,270
I can't, no, I can't put that on.

1525
02:56:36,790 --> 02:56:39,670
Visual concepts and yukes. If you're watching this right now,

1526
02:56:39,670 --> 02:56:42,469
nobody gives a shit if it's going to clip through the fucking back of the mask.

1527
02:56:43,030 --> 02:56:45,270
Nobody cares. Put it back.

1528
02:56:45,270 --> 02:56:47,510
Let us fucking put the shit on that we want to put on.

1529
02:56:47,510 --> 02:56:48,620
For the love of God.

1530
02:56:52,100 --> 02:56:55,700
Like, nobody gives a shit if this is going to, like, clip through my head or if this,

1531
02:56:55,700 --> 02:56:57,700
like, I can only put this on an entrance.

1532
02:56:57,700 --> 02:57:01,159
No, I don't care. I can't just have this on in the match. Why?

1533
02:57:04,950 --> 02:57:06,069
It just doesn't make any sense.

1534
02:57:08,360 --> 02:57:11,559
But anyways, use the neck feathers.

1535
02:57:24,600 --> 02:57:28,680
Like, why can I use this but not, like, the headphones?

1536
02:57:28,680 --> 02:57:30,600
It doesn't make any sense.

1537
02:57:30,600 --> 02:57:43,610
Golden duck? You're not even going to get to see it.

1538
02:57:44,170 --> 02:57:46,969
The duck is only, I can't even put it on.

1539
02:57:46,969 --> 02:57:49,979
Oh, sorry, you can't use this.

1540
02:57:49,979 --> 02:57:54,059
Let's limit 45% of every item in the whole game.

1541
02:57:54,620 --> 02:57:59,530
You know, I do consulting work.

1542
02:57:59,530 --> 02:58:01,799
2K. I do consulting work.

1543
02:58:03,700 --> 02:58:04,579
Need a consultant.

1544
02:58:10,889 --> 02:58:12,329
Gold neck. All right.

1545
02:58:12,329 --> 02:58:17,690
Still glowing. That's fine.

1546
02:58:17,690 --> 02:58:25,000
Well, if we're going that far, we might as well do this.

1547
02:59:35,860 --> 02:59:39,879
Sands. I don't even care about sands.

1548
02:59:39,879 --> 02:59:40,920
Stop this right now.

1549
02:59:42,229 --> 02:59:42,950
What am I doing?

1550
02:59:46,200 --> 02:59:47,479
I'm just, like, adding.

1551
02:59:47,479 --> 03:00:10,180
I'm adding and adding and adding and adding.

1552
03:00:10,180 --> 03:00:11,219
No, I don't like these.

1553
03:00:11,219 --> 03:00:20,739
I don't like them. Get rid of them.

1554
03:00:20,739 --> 03:00:21,459
All right. Stats.

1555
03:00:29,690 --> 03:00:31,850
It's like a fucking cartoon character.

1556
03:00:31,850 --> 03:00:37,049
Put his name on his chest.

1557
03:00:37,049 --> 03:00:38,649
Super green screen, right?

1558
03:00:38,649 --> 03:01:25,750
There you go.

1559
03:01:25,750 --> 03:01:26,549
Take it off.

1560
03:01:26,549 --> 03:01:27,909
No, it's a blue screen of death.

1561
03:01:40,299 --> 03:01:40,700
Ruined.

1562
03:01:43,819 --> 03:01:45,420
What? What do you mean ruined?

1563
03:01:45,420 --> 03:01:52,219
It's nasty. Remove it.

1564
03:01:52,940 --> 03:01:53,979
I'm going to keep it.

1565
03:01:53,979 --> 03:02:02,680
Disgusting.

1566
03:02:02,680 --> 03:02:03,959
No, it's staying there.

1567
03:02:03,959 --> 03:02:09,959
Give him a gold thong.

1568
03:02:09,959 --> 03:02:13,059
I mean, I kind of have to.

1569
03:02:13,059 --> 03:02:14,020
And I can't.

1570
03:02:14,020 --> 03:02:15,059
I can't do that.

1571
03:02:15,059 --> 03:02:16,709
Would you like me to do that?

1572
03:02:16,709 --> 03:02:18,790
Oh, look at all these options.

1573
03:02:18,790 --> 03:02:19,670
Look at all. Wow.

1574
03:02:19,670 --> 03:02:20,870
Look at these options.

1575
03:02:20,870 --> 03:02:23,139
Oh, wow.

1576
03:02:23,139 --> 03:02:27,399
Oh, I sure wish I could put them on.

1577
03:02:27,399 --> 03:02:29,639
No, look at the hundreds of fucking options.

1578
03:02:29,639 --> 03:02:30,360
No, no, no, no.

1579
03:02:30,360 --> 03:02:31,079
I can't. Sorry.

1580
03:02:31,079 --> 03:02:31,879
You can't do that.

1581
03:02:31,879 --> 03:02:33,079
Sorry. He gets underneath.

1582
03:02:33,079 --> 03:02:34,040
You can't put it over.

1583
03:02:34,040 --> 03:02:34,760
I'm sorry.

1584
03:02:35,319 --> 03:02:36,280
Sorry, sir.

1585
03:02:36,280 --> 03:02:38,040
Did you want to create a custom character?

1586
03:02:38,040 --> 03:02:47,350
No. Get a JPG of a thong.

1587
03:02:47,350 --> 03:03:16,420
Give me a second.

1588
03:03:16,420 --> 03:03:45,719
Uploading it now.

1589
03:03:45,719 --> 03:03:48,680
I'm not fucking around.

1590
03:03:48,680 --> 03:03:58,819
Are you still?

1591
03:03:58,819 --> 03:04:00,659
Okay. Uploading now.

1592
03:04:00,659 --> 03:04:02,500
It's a thong.

1593
03:04:04,809 --> 03:04:08,040
It's done. Done.

1594
03:04:08,040 --> 03:04:11,020
Done. Let's go get it.

1595
03:04:11,020 --> 03:04:27,239
Hold on.

1596
03:04:27,239 --> 03:04:28,680
Upload an actual blue screen.

1597
03:04:29,799 --> 03:04:30,280
Hold on.

1598
03:04:30,280 --> 03:04:31,319
Wait, let me just save.

1599
03:04:32,120 --> 03:04:32,920
Super fucking.

1600
03:04:32,920 --> 03:04:34,520
No, I got to change his name.

1601
03:04:35,319 --> 03:04:50,360
Stats.

1602
03:04:50,360 --> 03:04:51,879
No, no, I'll do the stats.

1603
03:04:51,879 --> 03:04:52,840
Just wait a second.

1604
03:04:52,840 --> 03:04:59,659
I got to go download this image.

1605
03:04:59,659 --> 03:05:01,739
I'm putting a fucking gold thong on him.

1606
03:05:01,739 --> 03:05:10,250
Why the thong?

1607
03:05:10,250 --> 03:05:16,819
Somebody told me to do it.

1608
03:05:16,819 --> 03:05:19,180
If you're new to the stream,

1609
03:05:19,180 --> 03:05:19,819
just listen.

1610
03:05:19,819 --> 03:05:21,180
This is important.

1611
03:05:21,180 --> 03:05:21,979
If you're a new viewer

1612
03:05:21,979 --> 03:05:22,780
or if you're an old viewer,

1613
03:05:22,780 --> 03:05:23,260
you're not sure.

1614
03:05:24,739 --> 03:05:26,819
If one person, one guy,

1615
03:05:26,819 --> 03:05:28,180
one person said to do that,

1616
03:05:29,299 --> 03:05:33,020
okay, you will eventually be the one guy

1617
03:05:33,899 --> 03:05:36,059
that I take the request.

1618
03:05:36,059 --> 03:05:37,340
You'll be the one guy at some point.

1619
03:05:37,979 --> 03:05:39,350
You can't give shit to the one guy

1620
03:05:39,350 --> 03:05:40,309
when you'll be the one guy

1621
03:05:40,309 --> 03:05:41,030
at some point soon.

1622
03:05:43,739 --> 03:05:45,340
Let me download my community fucking thing.

1623
03:05:46,299 --> 03:05:52,540
It's not even, it's pink.

1624
03:05:59,930 --> 03:06:00,969
Well, that kind of fucks

1625
03:06:00,969 --> 03:06:07,459
that whole thing up, doesn't it?

1626
03:06:07,459 --> 03:06:08,819
Super blue screen of death.

1627
03:06:09,379 --> 03:06:12,250
I can't even change the color.

1628
03:06:12,809 --> 03:06:13,770
That person's right.

1629
03:06:13,770 --> 03:06:14,729
That one guy's right.

1630
03:06:18,180 --> 03:06:19,700
I'm not making super Willow.

1631
03:06:19,700 --> 03:06:21,219
No, hold on.

1632
03:06:21,219 --> 03:06:21,700
Just wait.

1633
03:06:43,079 --> 03:06:44,600
It's only the front.

1634
03:06:45,399 --> 03:06:46,200
It's only the front.

1635
03:06:46,200 --> 03:06:47,159
Just hold on.

1636
03:06:52,860 --> 03:06:53,500
I can't even.

1637
03:06:53,500 --> 03:06:54,139
Yes, I can.

1638
03:06:54,139 --> 03:06:55,500
I can change the color.

1639
03:06:55,500 --> 03:06:56,059
No, I can't.

1640
03:07:24,219 --> 03:07:28,139
Oh my god.

1641
03:07:28,139 --> 03:07:29,420
At least I can make it match.

1642
03:07:30,059 --> 03:07:46,620
It's like riding up his ass so bad.

1643
03:07:55,590 --> 03:07:56,870
What the fuck did this achieve?

1644
03:07:59,799 --> 03:08:00,840
This didn't achieve anything.

1645
03:08:00,840 --> 03:08:01,399
I don't, I don't.

1646
03:09:25,670 --> 03:09:26,469
No, what am I doing?

1647
03:09:26,469 --> 03:09:27,989
I'm thinking like an arrow.

1648
03:09:27,989 --> 03:09:28,870
Get this out of here.

1649
03:09:28,870 --> 03:09:29,909
Delete this.

1650
03:09:29,909 --> 03:09:31,350
What am I, what are you doing?

1651
03:09:31,350 --> 03:09:32,229
No, no, no, no.

1652
03:09:32,229 --> 03:09:32,729
Get out.

1653
03:09:34,379 --> 03:09:36,469
Okay, we're fine.

1654
03:09:36,469 --> 03:09:37,110
Oh, fuck.

1655
03:09:37,110 --> 03:09:37,829
Juicy's gone.

1656
03:09:37,829 --> 03:10:01,610
What the fuck was I doing?

1657
03:10:01,610 --> 03:10:03,370
Arrow to like my crotch.

1658
03:10:03,370 --> 03:10:16,569
All right, we're good.

1659
03:10:23,430 --> 03:10:26,600
It just went off the rails real quick.

1660
03:10:26,600 --> 03:10:27,479
Really quickly.

1661
03:10:27,479 --> 03:10:31,239
All right.

1662
03:10:31,239 --> 03:10:32,360
Now I can do the stats.

1663
03:10:32,360 --> 03:10:33,639
I gotta make sure the stats are 100.

1664
03:10:36,649 --> 03:10:37,690
Remember the fight?

1665
03:10:39,510 --> 03:10:40,549
Yeah, I do.

1666
03:10:40,549 --> 03:10:56,979
So many fucking people.

1667
03:10:56,979 --> 03:10:57,459
Where are you?

1668
03:11:05,879 --> 03:11:06,440
Okay.

1669
03:11:06,440 --> 03:11:09,799
Super PSOD from Las Vegas.

1670
03:11:09,799 --> 03:11:11,290
It's true.

1671
03:11:11,290 --> 03:11:12,629
All right, let's go.

1672
03:11:12,629 --> 03:11:21,590
Wasn't this supposed to only be like a two to three hour stream?

1673
03:11:21,590 --> 03:11:23,270
Yeah, this is the encore.

1674
03:11:23,270 --> 03:11:27,209
I mean, the event already happened.

1675
03:11:27,209 --> 03:11:28,889
The green screen won twice.

1676
03:11:31,799 --> 03:11:34,200
So we're just kind of having fun sticking around now.

1677
03:11:45,100 --> 03:11:45,420
All right.

1678
03:11:46,059 --> 03:11:47,100
Actually 100.

1679
03:11:47,739 --> 03:11:48,940
All level three skills.

1680
03:11:49,899 --> 03:12:04,260
And here is the final match of this particular circuit.

1681
03:12:04,260 --> 03:12:07,879
We spent so much time on these two idiots.

1682
03:12:08,600 --> 03:12:12,229
Menu pose.

1683
03:12:12,950 --> 03:12:20,459
Pretty good.

1684
03:12:21,020 --> 03:12:22,709
Done.

1685
03:12:27,670 --> 03:12:29,110
He's doing a Jojo pose.

1686
03:12:29,110 --> 03:12:29,750
No, he's not.

1687
03:12:30,389 --> 03:12:32,040
Thank you for the thong.

1688
03:12:32,040 --> 03:12:32,840
You're welcome.

1689
03:12:32,840 --> 03:12:35,319
One guy out of 7,000 people.

1690
03:12:36,040 --> 03:12:38,840
What have I done to him?

1691
03:12:38,840 --> 03:12:41,399
I made him that much more powerful.

1692
03:12:42,040 --> 03:12:45,139
All right, let's go.

1693
03:12:45,860 --> 03:12:48,309
While this loads, I'm going to go grab another drink.

1694
03:12:48,950 --> 03:12:50,069
Because why not, right?

1695
03:12:51,030 --> 03:12:53,799
One on one, Hell in a Cell.

1696
03:13:01,079 --> 03:13:03,799
Super Jax versus super blue screen of death.

1697
03:13:04,520 --> 03:13:09,139
There are no rules in Hell in a Cell.

1698
03:13:16,659 --> 03:13:16,979
All right.

1699
03:13:18,260 --> 03:13:19,540
For the entrances, here they come.

1700
03:13:19,540 --> 03:13:20,420
I'm going to grab a drink.

1701
03:13:21,059 --> 03:13:23,079
I'm not sure these two even have entrances.

1702
03:13:23,639 --> 03:13:25,659
I'll be right back.

1703
03:13:25,659 --> 03:13:27,110
See you in a second.

1704
03:13:27,110 --> 03:13:27,909
Watch the intros.

1705
03:13:28,549 --> 03:13:34,420
I can't, why can I not turn my stream?

1706
03:13:34,420 --> 03:13:37,850
It doesn't want to, hold on.

1707
03:13:37,850 --> 03:13:39,930
It really, it's going to be so much brighter than this.

1708
03:13:40,569 --> 03:13:42,819
Because that's not even a rendered light source.

1709
03:13:49,579 --> 03:13:50,379
I still can't do it.

1710
03:13:50,940 --> 03:13:52,950
What the fuck not?

1711
03:13:52,950 --> 03:13:55,030
Apparently I can't mute my microphone, so whatever.

1712
03:13:55,030 --> 03:13:55,829
We're in Illinois.

1713
03:13:55,829 --> 03:13:56,389
See you in a second.

1714
03:13:57,030 --> 03:13:59,530
It's going to be the same two entrances back to back,

1715
03:13:59,530 --> 03:14:00,409
because I never gave them that.

1716
03:16:29,690 --> 03:16:30,809
It started.

1717
03:16:30,809 --> 03:16:32,250
It started already, what?

1718
03:16:33,370 --> 03:16:34,569
Oh my god, what did I miss?

1719
03:16:35,450 --> 03:16:36,170
What did I miss?

1720
03:16:41,770 --> 03:16:43,530
Nothing, it just, okay, just started, good.

1721
03:16:44,090 --> 03:16:46,100
So if you don't know the Hell in a Cell rules,

1722
03:16:48,020 --> 03:16:50,260
the only way you can win is by pinning.

1723
03:16:50,260 --> 03:16:51,620
You just have to pin the guy.

1724
03:16:51,620 --> 03:16:52,120
That's it.

1725
03:16:53,379 --> 03:16:56,260
But, but, super juicy, by the way.

1726
03:16:58,170 --> 03:16:59,770
We've got the two strongest competitors

1727
03:16:59,770 --> 03:17:01,930
that have ever been in a German Rumble, ever.

1728
03:17:02,489 --> 03:17:08,379
We've got the super blue screen of death and super Jax.

1729
03:17:11,059 --> 03:17:13,780
Mere mortals are in attendance right now.

1730
03:17:14,340 --> 03:17:16,459
What about Zaraxos?

1731
03:17:17,180 --> 03:17:20,379
Well Zaraxos is the most powerful in the underworld.

1732
03:17:20,379 --> 03:17:21,420
We're talking about on Earth.

1733
03:17:24,540 --> 03:17:26,780
I wonder if, I'm going to go for a pin here,

1734
03:17:26,780 --> 03:17:28,299
super Jax on blue screen of death.

1735
03:17:29,020 --> 03:17:30,840
No, not even a one count.

1736
03:17:30,840 --> 03:17:32,680
This is going to be like a four hour long match.

1737
03:17:33,319 --> 03:17:38,700
We're just watching gods fight each other.

1738
03:17:42,409 --> 03:17:43,370
That fucking thong.

1739
03:17:44,170 --> 03:17:47,879
Zaraxos is not even in their league.

1740
03:17:47,879 --> 03:17:48,760
He's a commoner.

1741
03:17:49,879 --> 03:17:53,079
I, I mean, he doesn't glow, so there's that.

1742
03:17:53,799 --> 03:17:57,450
I wonder if we're going to see any,

1743
03:17:57,450 --> 03:17:58,889
all right, now we're going to the outside here.

1744
03:17:59,530 --> 03:18:02,520
Are we going to get to see some Hell in a Cell mayhem?

1745
03:18:06,280 --> 03:18:08,520
They're locked in here until somebody wins.

1746
03:18:09,399 --> 03:18:11,319
Reversal there by super blue screen of death.

1747
03:18:12,409 --> 03:18:17,299
Onto the corner, falls over the steps.

1748
03:18:18,180 --> 03:18:19,139
Play music.

1749
03:18:21,500 --> 03:18:21,979
Hold on.

1750
03:18:25,190 --> 03:18:30,549
Oh, you can, ah, this is a spoiler right here.

1751
03:18:30,549 --> 03:18:31,909
You can like see their stats.

1752
03:18:36,329 --> 03:18:37,209
Fighting music.

1753
03:18:40,409 --> 03:18:42,729
This is, this is called best fight music.

1754
03:18:42,729 --> 03:18:50,920
So here's best fight music.

1755
03:18:50,920 --> 03:18:54,040
Oh, people are going to hate this.

1756
03:19:15,659 --> 03:19:17,659
Let's get the stream copyright striked.

1757
03:19:17,659 --> 03:19:18,700
What do you say?

1758
03:19:18,700 --> 03:19:24,440
Oh, what a reversal by blue screen of death.

1759
03:19:28,020 --> 03:19:29,059
No, that better not be it.

1760
03:19:30,340 --> 03:19:38,899
One, two of Jax is bleeding from the face.

1761
03:19:39,700 --> 03:19:43,819
The signature choke move from blue screen of death.

1762
03:19:44,620 --> 03:19:47,100
They've both evolved since the beginning of this stream.

1763
03:19:51,030 --> 03:19:52,790
Can super Jax make it a two for two?

1764
03:20:05,979 --> 03:20:07,180
That's the fucking move.

1765
03:20:07,180 --> 03:20:08,540
Pass down the Elberton line.

1766
03:20:09,420 --> 03:20:14,649
Nobody can stop super Jax.

1767
03:20:15,530 --> 03:20:16,889
Not even God himself.

1768
03:20:17,690 --> 03:20:20,920
Here it comes.

1769
03:20:21,879 --> 03:20:22,440
Here it comes.

1770
03:20:23,319 --> 03:20:33,219
The diaper on the top rope.

1771
03:20:33,780 --> 03:20:35,059
This is live by the way.

1772
03:20:35,059 --> 03:20:35,940
Look at the top right corner.

1773
03:20:35,940 --> 03:20:36,819
It's live.

1774
03:20:37,620 --> 03:20:38,500
Hurricane Rana.

1775
03:20:39,219 --> 03:20:39,700
No, no.

1776
03:20:39,700 --> 03:20:47,459
Reversal and a spear.

1777
03:20:48,260 --> 03:20:49,059
Can he get the pin?

1778
03:20:49,700 --> 03:20:51,139
What a pathetic way to end.

1779
03:20:52,100 --> 03:20:57,379
Does Jax have it in him?

1780
03:20:57,379 --> 03:20:59,620
Can Jax possibly recover here?

1781
03:20:59,620 --> 03:21:00,739
I don't think it's possible.

1782
03:21:03,159 --> 03:21:03,719
Reversal.

1783
03:21:04,360 --> 03:21:12,409
Oh, there's nothing that can be done.

1784
03:21:12,409 --> 03:21:13,450
Jax is going to lose.

1785
03:21:14,250 --> 03:21:20,870
He's going to the top rope to crash the computer.

1786
03:21:22,170 --> 03:21:22,729
Wait a minute.

1787
03:21:23,530 --> 03:21:24,840
Wait a minute.

1788
03:21:27,139 --> 03:21:27,540
Can he?

1789
03:21:28,440 --> 03:21:29,719
No, he can't.

1790
03:21:33,860 --> 03:21:34,659
No, he can't.

1791
03:21:35,540 --> 03:21:36,020
He can't.

1792
03:21:36,659 --> 03:21:37,700
He can't.

1793
03:21:37,700 --> 03:21:38,739
But wait, he dodged it.

1794
03:21:39,860 --> 03:21:40,979
No, they both suck.

1795
03:21:42,020 --> 03:21:42,979
Gods among men.

1796
03:21:49,020 --> 03:21:50,540
Out to the outside again.

1797
03:21:57,159 --> 03:21:58,440
Do a spirit bomb.

1798
03:21:58,440 --> 03:21:59,079
Do anything.

1799
03:22:00,600 --> 03:22:03,639
Climb on top of the cage and fucking kill somebody.

1800
03:22:06,040 --> 03:22:08,040
Power bomb him from the top of the cage and kill him.

1801
03:22:13,879 --> 03:22:14,520
Backwards.

1802
03:22:15,399 --> 03:22:16,280
Oh, there it is.

1803
03:22:18,440 --> 03:22:19,639
The backwards move.

1804
03:22:19,639 --> 03:22:20,520
Is that going to be enough?

1805
03:22:21,319 --> 03:22:21,819
One.

1806
03:22:22,520 --> 03:22:23,020
Two.

1807
03:22:23,159 --> 03:22:23,659
No.

1808
03:23:25,290 --> 03:23:25,790
Let's go.

1809
03:23:26,409 --> 03:23:33,940
That's a power bomb pin.

1810
03:23:35,319 --> 03:23:35,819
Two.

1811
03:23:36,120 --> 03:23:36,520
Three.

1812
03:23:36,520 --> 03:23:37,239
No, that's not it.

1813
03:23:37,239 --> 03:23:37,799
That's not it.

1814
03:23:38,600 --> 03:23:40,389
Wait, what is he?

1815
03:23:40,389 --> 03:23:40,889
What?

1816
03:23:42,139 --> 03:23:42,940
Nice recovery.

1817
03:23:42,940 --> 03:23:43,739
He's running away.

1818
03:23:45,260 --> 03:23:46,379
What are you doing?

1819
03:23:47,420 --> 03:23:47,920
Check him.

1820
03:23:56,309 --> 03:23:57,270
What is happening?

1821
03:24:01,579 --> 03:24:02,139
So loud.

1822
03:24:02,940 --> 03:24:04,219
So he just pinned him again?

1823
03:24:04,780 --> 03:24:05,280
One.

1824
03:24:05,739 --> 03:24:06,239
Two.

1825
03:24:07,100 --> 03:24:11,739
He didn't get.

1826
03:24:13,770 --> 03:24:14,649
That's too much for me.

1827
03:24:47,860 --> 03:24:48,360
Crash it.

1828
03:24:51,049 --> 03:24:51,850
Oh, two.

1829
03:24:54,309 --> 03:24:56,229
And a backspinning soccer ball kick.

1830
03:25:00,010 --> 03:25:02,010
Can he go all the way here?

1831
03:25:02,889 --> 03:25:07,350
All he needed was the default YouTuber elevator music.

1832
03:25:08,229 --> 03:25:09,190
Was that going to be enough?

1833
03:25:10,520 --> 03:25:11,020
One.

1834
03:25:11,639 --> 03:25:12,139
Two.

1835
03:25:12,920 --> 03:25:13,420
Three.

1836
03:25:13,420 --> 03:25:14,040
He just did it.

1837
03:25:14,040 --> 03:25:14,540
He did.

1838
03:25:15,079 --> 03:25:15,799
That was lame.

1839
03:25:16,520 --> 03:25:17,020
That's...

1840
03:25:17,639 --> 03:25:22,520
They didn't even go on the top of the cell.

1841
03:25:23,239 --> 03:25:26,420
That was fucking stupid.

1842
03:25:27,059 --> 03:25:28,100
I don't even want to see this.

1843
03:25:47,139 --> 03:25:50,200
Ape man.

1844
03:25:50,200 --> 03:25:51,879
Ape man fucking ladder match.

1845
03:25:52,600 --> 03:25:53,100
No.

1846
03:25:53,850 --> 03:25:55,370
Ape man battle royale.

1847
03:25:55,370 --> 03:26:02,459
Ape man ladder?

1848
03:26:02,459 --> 03:26:03,260
That's not going to work.

1849
03:26:05,180 --> 03:26:06,139
Ladder tag?

1850
03:26:06,139 --> 03:26:06,860
Four-way?

1851
03:26:06,860 --> 03:26:07,579
Ladder...

1852
03:26:07,579 --> 03:26:08,379
Four-way tag?

1853
03:26:08,940 --> 03:26:13,819
What is it I tell him?

1854
03:26:13,819 --> 03:26:15,020
Turn entrances off.

1855
03:26:16,440 --> 03:26:17,319
Battle royale.

1856
03:26:17,319 --> 03:26:18,200
Can I change the rules?

1857
03:26:18,920 --> 03:26:26,329
Oh, let me see here.

1858
03:26:28,719 --> 03:26:29,520
Ladder.

1859
03:26:29,520 --> 03:26:30,799
What if I don't do ape man?

1860
03:26:31,360 --> 03:26:37,579
It's a rumble.

1861
03:26:37,579 --> 03:26:38,379
How do I...

1862
03:26:38,379 --> 03:26:39,420
Really rumble tournament.

1863
03:26:40,139 --> 03:26:42,649
Let me see here.

1864
03:26:42,649 --> 03:26:45,049
Extreme iron man last man's mission custom match.

1865
03:26:45,850 --> 03:26:48,250
Oh, fuck it.

1866
03:26:48,250 --> 03:26:51,129
Let's put like the shittiest characters in an ape man fucking ladder match.

1867
03:26:51,129 --> 03:26:51,850
Who gives a shit?

1868
03:26:52,569 --> 03:26:53,850
This is gonna be impossible.

1869
03:26:55,440 --> 03:26:57,040
Who are the worst characters in the whole thing?

1870
03:26:57,920 --> 03:26:58,479
Dr. Donna?

1871
03:26:58,479 --> 03:26:58,959
Dr. Dan?

1872
03:27:02,479 --> 03:27:03,920
And put super jacks in it.

1873
03:27:06,110 --> 03:27:06,430
All right.

1874
03:27:06,430 --> 03:27:07,149
Adam Sandler.

1875
03:27:08,590 --> 03:27:22,520
Adam Sandler sands the hornet 95.

1876
03:27:26,540 --> 03:27:27,100
Hold on you.

1877
03:27:27,659 --> 03:27:29,760
I can let Otto out here in a second.

1878
03:27:30,479 --> 03:27:32,399
No, I've refused to put quiet man in here.

1879
03:27:32,399 --> 03:27:32,899
He sucks.

1880
03:27:34,059 --> 03:27:35,340
Let's put fireman's...

1881
03:27:35,340 --> 03:27:37,819
I just want to put fireman in a match because I believe he's in 99.

1882
03:27:37,819 --> 03:27:38,620
I believe he deserves it.

1883
03:27:46,299 --> 03:27:46,940
The hornet's...

1884
03:27:48,760 --> 03:27:49,000
What?

1885
03:27:49,000 --> 03:27:49,799
Oh, he's already there.

1886
03:27:52,569 --> 03:27:53,690
No, pinwheel sucks.

1887
03:27:55,770 --> 03:27:57,129
Super blue screen of death.

1888
03:27:57,690 --> 03:28:01,760
Come on, let's go.

1889
03:28:04,889 --> 03:28:26,559
And this will probably be the last one of the night.

1890
03:28:27,200 --> 03:28:30,729
This is...

1891
03:28:30,729 --> 03:28:32,010
I'm going against the grain here.

1892
03:28:33,899 --> 03:28:36,540
Usually I do the event and then that's it.

1893
03:28:36,540 --> 03:28:38,860
But I've been having a lot of fun.

1894
03:28:38,860 --> 03:28:39,100
All right.

1895
03:28:39,100 --> 03:28:40,940
So let's put the car valet in there.

1896
03:28:41,500 --> 03:28:42,299
Deserves to be there.

1897
03:28:43,020 --> 03:28:46,520
Let's get rid of the paybacks though because they're not fair.

1898
03:28:52,139 --> 03:28:55,389
Wall dad put in super jex.

1899
03:28:55,389 --> 03:28:56,430
That's going to be so...

1900
03:28:56,430 --> 03:28:57,629
They're going to win.

1901
03:28:57,629 --> 03:28:59,069
Super jex is going to win.

1902
03:28:59,069 --> 03:28:59,309
All right.

1903
03:28:59,309 --> 03:29:00,190
We'll put wall dad in.

1904
03:29:00,909 --> 03:29:07,549
Blue man.

1905
03:29:07,549 --> 03:29:07,790
All right.

1906
03:29:07,790 --> 03:29:08,750
Blue man deserves to be there.

1907
03:29:08,750 --> 03:29:09,149
You're right.

1908
03:29:11,260 --> 03:29:12,139
And last one.

1909
03:29:14,639 --> 03:29:15,040
Otto.

1910
03:29:15,770 --> 03:29:16,729
Now Willem Dafoe.

1911
03:29:17,450 --> 03:29:17,850
I agree.

1912
03:29:18,729 --> 03:29:19,049
All right.

1913
03:29:19,690 --> 03:29:22,409
Sand low hornet, sands, fireman, wall dad, Willem Dafoe, car valet,

1914
03:29:22,409 --> 03:29:24,090
blue man in an eight man ladder match.

1915
03:29:24,090 --> 03:29:25,129
Before it was six man.

1916
03:29:25,850 --> 03:29:27,209
And I thought that was too much.

1917
03:29:27,209 --> 03:29:32,969
So entrance is off.

1918
03:29:35,129 --> 03:29:35,770
They all like...

1919
03:29:35,770 --> 03:29:39,049
Look, I didn't make entrances for people that weren't going to be in the like actual card.

1920
03:29:39,850 --> 03:29:41,500
Let's go.

1921
03:29:41,500 --> 03:29:44,360
Place your bets.

1922
03:29:45,000 --> 03:29:47,799
And who's going to win the eight fucking man ladder match?

1923
03:29:51,370 --> 03:29:56,379
I'm saying like a bunch of fucking dumb asses.

1924
03:29:59,040 --> 03:29:59,360
All right.

1925
03:29:59,360 --> 03:30:00,000
Good luck.

1926
03:30:00,000 --> 03:30:01,209
Good luck to who?

1927
03:30:02,010 --> 03:30:02,329
Wow.

1928
03:30:02,329 --> 03:30:03,049
What a joke.

1929
03:30:04,319 --> 03:30:05,840
This is an absolute joke.

1930
03:30:06,719 --> 03:30:07,600
Nothing's going to get done.

1931
03:30:10,540 --> 03:30:11,739
Nothing's going to get done.

1932
03:30:15,260 --> 03:30:16,459
There's too many people.

1933
03:30:16,459 --> 03:30:17,659
There's two ladders.

1934
03:30:18,299 --> 03:30:19,819
What a reversal by Willem Dafoe.

1935
03:30:20,620 --> 03:30:22,200
Car valet is already outside.

1936
03:30:22,200 --> 03:30:23,319
Adam Sandler in the car valet.

1937
03:30:24,120 --> 03:30:25,309
All right.

1938
03:30:25,309 --> 03:30:25,870
What time is it?

1939
03:30:26,510 --> 03:30:28,030
It's 8.09 Pacific.

1940
03:30:28,750 --> 03:30:30,639
I bet you this takes 30 minutes.

1941
03:30:31,360 --> 03:30:36,700
Hope to God you guys like watching this because this is going to take an hour.

1942
03:30:43,950 --> 03:30:44,350
Duel.

1943
03:30:44,909 --> 03:30:47,260
Hornet and wall dad outside there.

1944
03:30:47,899 --> 03:30:50,379
It's interesting because there's a pair for everything.

1945
03:30:50,940 --> 03:30:52,299
Two, four, six, eight.

1946
03:30:53,340 --> 03:30:54,299
It's one of the pairs.

1947
03:30:54,940 --> 03:30:57,739
Wall dad and wall hornet are fighting.

1948
03:30:57,739 --> 03:30:58,860
Which is weird.

1949
03:30:58,860 --> 03:30:59,579
Kind of strange.

1950
03:31:01,629 --> 03:31:02,750
Blue man and Willem Dafoe.

1951
03:31:06,239 --> 03:31:07,840
Wall dad is really trying to get rid of those hornets.

1952
03:31:08,479 --> 03:31:12,139
Sandler in car valet.

1953
03:31:18,059 --> 03:31:19,739
Is this louder than it typically is?

1954
03:31:19,739 --> 03:31:21,020
Why is it so loud?

1955
03:31:24,219 --> 03:31:25,420
Sand's in fire, man.

1956
03:31:27,719 --> 03:31:28,120
It's weird.

1957
03:31:28,120 --> 03:31:30,120
The two fucking weird characters are fighting.

1958
03:31:31,000 --> 03:31:33,819
The two human characters are fighting.

1959
03:31:33,819 --> 03:31:36,059
And the two comic book characters are fighting.

1960
03:31:37,020 --> 03:31:39,200
You saw me do it.

1961
03:31:39,200 --> 03:31:40,319
I didn't fucking do it.

1962
03:31:40,319 --> 03:31:41,600
Wall dad, wall hornet.

1963
03:31:41,600 --> 03:31:43,120
Two normal guys.

1964
03:31:43,120 --> 03:31:44,399
Car valet, Adam Sandler.

1965
03:31:44,399 --> 03:31:45,360
Comic book characters.

1966
03:31:46,079 --> 03:31:47,200
Blue man, Willem Dafoe.

1967
03:31:47,200 --> 03:31:48,799
And the two weirdos, fireman and sand.

1968
03:31:49,600 --> 03:31:51,770
I didn't do that.

1969
03:31:52,729 --> 03:31:53,850
It just did it itself.

1970
03:31:59,360 --> 03:32:00,719
Wall dad is like, I'm doing this.

1971
03:32:01,360 --> 03:32:02,559
I'm doing this for my son.

1972
03:32:05,069 --> 03:32:06,110
Fucking minecon.

1973
03:32:07,850 --> 03:32:10,409
Big clothesline there from Willem Dafoe on the car valet.

1974
03:32:13,389 --> 03:32:14,270
Great commentary.

1975
03:32:14,909 --> 03:32:19,440
Yes, minecon.

1976
03:32:20,000 --> 03:32:24,000
What's with the ring?

1977
03:32:24,639 --> 03:32:25,520
Holy shit.

1978
03:32:27,709 --> 03:32:32,360
Wall dad just absolutely annihilated the hornet.

1979
03:32:32,360 --> 03:32:35,399
Just punched him in the face so hard that he fell into the ladder.

1980
03:32:36,200 --> 03:32:40,350
Blue man now getting a couple of shots on fireman

1981
03:32:40,350 --> 03:32:41,870
who has rolled onto the outside.

1982
03:32:43,629 --> 03:32:44,829
Wall dad with a wall knee.

1983
03:32:45,469 --> 03:32:47,479
Blue man is going up.

1984
03:32:47,479 --> 03:32:50,280
He wants to win at least one competition, right?

1985
03:32:52,319 --> 03:32:54,319
Blue man has to win a fucking competition.

1986
03:32:54,319 --> 03:32:56,079
He's been around for like six years.

1987
03:32:56,879 --> 03:32:59,319
Can he please win something?

1988
03:33:01,930 --> 03:33:03,450
No, apparently not.

1989
03:33:03,450 --> 03:33:09,760
Willem Dafoe puts a quick work of blue man

1990
03:33:10,719 --> 03:33:13,280
while the two human characters are still fighting.

1991
03:33:14,079 --> 03:33:17,680
Sandler and car valet are still fighting each other.

1992
03:33:18,559 --> 03:33:21,290
Adam Sandler is kicking his ass somehow.

1993
03:33:25,549 --> 03:33:27,870
Why is fireman just sitting there?

1994
03:33:28,829 --> 03:33:30,590
Fireman does not understand what to do.

1995
03:33:31,149 --> 03:33:33,469
I mean he does have like four brain cells

1996
03:33:33,469 --> 03:33:35,709
so you really can't put that on him.

1997
03:33:35,709 --> 03:33:37,069
He probably could have won the match right there

1998
03:33:37,069 --> 03:33:39,950
but he decided he decided he's not gonna do it.

1999
03:33:40,590 --> 03:33:43,959
He'd rather throw blue man out and go after him

2000
03:33:43,959 --> 03:33:45,000
rather than win the match.

2001
03:33:45,879 --> 03:33:47,559
He could have just won.

2002
03:33:47,559 --> 03:33:49,399
And now the hornet's going up there to try to win the game.

2003
03:33:50,040 --> 03:33:54,360
Adam Sandler now is the only person in the ring that has any eyeballs

2004
03:33:54,360 --> 03:33:55,639
and he's not doing anything.

2005
03:33:55,639 --> 03:33:57,559
He's gonna go up the other side of the fucking ladder

2006
03:33:58,280 --> 03:33:59,719
stops the hornet potentially.

2007
03:34:00,760 --> 03:34:02,680
Adam Sandler now has an opportunity

2008
03:34:02,680 --> 03:34:05,799
but wall dad coming in to take a fucking wall down.

2009
03:34:06,520 --> 03:34:08,670
Oh he's not strong enough.

2010
03:34:08,670 --> 03:34:10,030
He's not strong enough.

2011
03:34:12,409 --> 03:34:14,729
Come on with all your dad strength.

2012
03:34:14,729 --> 03:34:16,170
Take the fucking wall down.

2013
03:34:16,889 --> 03:34:18,010
There it is.

2014
03:34:18,569 --> 03:34:21,260
He's from house flipper.

2015
03:34:21,260 --> 03:34:22,299
He's fucking strong.

2016
03:34:28,360 --> 03:34:29,559
Oh my god.

2017
03:34:29,559 --> 03:34:31,200
He did it.

2018
03:34:32,270 --> 03:34:33,549
Wall dad saves the day.

2019
03:34:38,059 --> 03:34:39,260
This is never gonna get done.

2020
03:34:42,459 --> 03:34:43,180
Big.

2021
03:34:43,260 --> 03:34:44,379
No I thought it was gonna be a powerbomb.

2022
03:34:44,379 --> 03:34:45,260
Willem Dafoe on the ground.

2023
03:34:45,260 --> 03:34:49,239
Now Sands going after Willem Dafoe on the back with the ladder

2024
03:34:49,239 --> 03:34:50,280
and now on the stomach.

2025
03:34:50,280 --> 03:34:51,559
Hornet is taking a break

2026
03:34:52,200 --> 03:34:56,600
while blue man has like three dead bodies in front of him.

2027
03:34:56,600 --> 03:34:59,000
Adam Sandler is unconscious sitting up.

2028
03:35:00,350 --> 03:35:01,870
No he seems to be coming too.

2029
03:35:03,079 --> 03:35:05,399
Sands under tail or should I say Deltarune

2030
03:35:05,399 --> 03:35:07,000
going up to the top of the fucking top rope

2031
03:35:07,000 --> 03:35:08,520
to get the briefcase.

2032
03:35:08,520 --> 03:35:10,520
Willem Dafoe is the only one that can see.

2033
03:35:10,520 --> 03:35:13,000
Wall dad get the fuck out of here.

2034
03:35:13,719 --> 03:35:15,079
I'm the only one that stops this.

2035
03:35:15,079 --> 03:35:15,719
No he doesn't care.

2036
03:35:15,719 --> 03:35:16,360
Willem Dafoe.

2037
03:35:16,360 --> 03:35:16,860
No.

2038
03:35:21,340 --> 03:35:22,299
Come on wall dad.

2039
03:35:22,299 --> 03:35:23,340
Take it to the wall down.

2040
03:35:26,829 --> 03:35:29,950
Wall dad again showing his brute house flipper strength.

2041
03:35:36,829 --> 03:35:39,149
Wall dad receiving a lot of punishment

2042
03:35:39,149 --> 03:35:41,069
for his saving the match.

2043
03:35:41,069 --> 03:35:41,950
Car valet.

2044
03:35:42,909 --> 03:35:43,709
Is that a car?

2045
03:35:45,629 --> 03:35:46,590
Declare.

2046
03:35:46,590 --> 03:35:48,430
He's going up to the top to get the briefcase.

2047
03:35:48,989 --> 03:35:51,840
Can Car valet end this right now

2048
03:35:51,840 --> 03:35:53,280
and cause a conniption?

2049
03:35:56,190 --> 03:35:56,690
No.

2050
03:35:57,389 --> 03:35:58,430
Hornet's going up top.

2051
03:35:59,500 --> 03:36:00,459
The conniption is over.

2052
03:36:02,799 --> 03:36:03,360
Is it though?

2053
03:36:06,920 --> 03:36:09,639
This is just a brutal multiple punches in the face.

2054
03:36:09,639 --> 03:36:10,920
Car valet is stopping this.

2055
03:36:12,319 --> 03:36:14,479
Somebody got really hurt and I don't know who it was.

2056
03:36:14,479 --> 03:36:15,360
Wall dad.

2057
03:36:16,079 --> 03:36:16,799
Wall dad.

2058
03:36:19,469 --> 03:36:21,469
He's like yeah I did it I fucking knocked it down

2059
03:36:21,469 --> 03:36:22,829
right into the Sands power bump.

2060
03:36:25,790 --> 03:36:28,350
You can never set up a you can't set up a ladder

2061
03:36:28,350 --> 03:36:29,069
in front of wall dad.

2062
03:36:29,629 --> 03:36:31,709
He'll take it down and put a bathtub in the other room.

2063
03:36:33,610 --> 03:36:34,889
Adam Sandler is dead.

2064
03:36:35,690 --> 03:36:36,190
Uh oh.

2065
03:36:37,149 --> 03:36:41,149
Sands undertale gonna unimpeded go up top here.

2066
03:36:43,219 --> 03:36:44,899
Wall dad with the strength.

2067
03:36:44,899 --> 03:36:46,579
Trying glue man now getting up here.

2068
03:36:46,579 --> 03:36:47,459
Hornet getting up here.

2069
03:36:48,100 --> 03:36:49,219
Can they stop it?

2070
03:36:49,219 --> 03:36:50,180
Big punches.

2071
03:36:50,180 --> 03:36:51,059
Jumping punch.

2072
03:36:51,059 --> 03:36:53,059
He decides to put hornet in a headlock.

2073
03:36:53,059 --> 03:36:56,659
Wall dad is going hard again.

2074
03:36:56,659 --> 03:36:57,860
He can't do it.

2075
03:36:57,860 --> 03:36:59,459
He can't do it.

2076
03:36:59,459 --> 03:37:01,860
Sands is gonna get the briefcase.

2077
03:37:01,860 --> 03:37:04,739
Somehow Adam Sandler and wall dad.

2078
03:37:06,270 --> 03:37:07,629
No he didn't get it.

2079
03:37:07,629 --> 03:37:08,129
He's up.

2080
03:37:12,430 --> 03:37:12,930
No.

2081
03:37:13,549 --> 03:37:16,909
Carvalli goes underneath his legs.

2082
03:37:18,110 --> 03:37:21,260
Oh nobody wins.

2083
03:37:21,979 --> 03:37:23,549
Hornet's on the top ropes.

2084
03:37:24,670 --> 03:37:27,889
What a stinger.

2085
03:37:27,889 --> 03:37:30,049
Let's call the stinger Willem Dafoe pointing to the crowd

2086
03:37:30,049 --> 03:37:30,690
to try to get some.

2087
03:37:32,850 --> 03:37:41,819
I can't even fucking talk.

2088
03:37:45,040 --> 03:37:45,840
Don't tell Harry.

2089
03:37:46,479 --> 03:37:48,479
Fireman going up to the top.

2090
03:37:48,479 --> 03:37:50,159
Is fireman gonna get the briefcase?

2091
03:37:50,159 --> 03:37:51,440
Can he do it unimpeded?

2092
03:37:51,440 --> 03:37:52,559
Willem Dafoe.

2093
03:37:52,559 --> 03:37:53,600
Hornet is coming up here.

2094
03:37:54,239 --> 03:37:56,079
Possibly to get it to stop.

2095
03:37:56,799 --> 03:37:57,920
Willem Dafoe no.

2096
03:37:57,920 --> 03:37:59,200
Pulling a wall dad.

2097
03:37:59,200 --> 03:38:02,239
Trying to get it to stop fireman holding on with his flames.

2098
03:38:02,799 --> 03:38:05,440
He lets go gets thrown up by the hornet.

2099
03:38:05,440 --> 03:38:09,360
Hornet is now it's their opportunity to try to get the briefcase.

2100
03:38:10,079 --> 03:38:11,280
Somebody call wall dad.

2101
03:38:12,350 --> 03:38:13,229
Hornet's gonna get it.

2102
03:38:13,229 --> 03:38:15,950
Nobody's Sands is standing there scratching his head.

2103
03:38:17,309 --> 03:38:18,270
The hornet is the winner.

2104
03:38:28,739 --> 03:38:30,340
Why is it showing us this?

2105
03:38:31,540 --> 03:38:36,959
Oh you kicked him who fucking cares.

2106
03:38:36,959 --> 03:38:38,479
You kicked him in the back of the leg.

2107
03:38:39,200 --> 03:38:41,040
Another chokeslam from Adam Sandler.

2108
03:38:42,860 --> 03:38:43,739
We don't even get to see it.

2109
03:38:59,899 --> 03:39:00,379
One more.

2110
03:39:00,379 --> 03:39:01,579
All right we'll do another one.

2111
03:39:01,579 --> 03:39:06,110
How many can you do in a backstage brawl?

2112
03:39:06,829 --> 03:39:12,180
Can I do more than five?

2113
03:39:15,170 --> 03:39:16,049
Fatal four way.

2114
03:39:16,770 --> 03:39:17,889
False count anywhere.

2115
03:39:18,850 --> 03:39:22,909
Triple threat.

2116
03:39:22,909 --> 03:39:23,870
False count anywhere.

2117
03:39:24,510 --> 03:39:31,040
Two on three.

2118
03:39:31,040 --> 03:39:31,760
One on two.

2119
03:39:31,760 --> 03:39:32,399
One on three.

2120
03:39:35,139 --> 03:39:39,809
Do another Helen.

2121
03:39:39,809 --> 03:39:41,489
I wish they would go up top for the Helen as well.

2122
03:39:43,149 --> 03:39:44,909
One on three versus super Jax.

2123
03:39:46,940 --> 03:39:47,659
All right fine.

2124
03:39:48,219 --> 03:39:49,340
One on three tag.

2125
03:39:58,079 --> 03:40:08,159
All right here's super Jax versus BF Bugleberry.

2126
03:40:08,159 --> 03:40:09,360
He's gonna he's a hundred.

2127
03:40:09,360 --> 03:40:10,000
I can't do that.

2128
03:40:14,399 --> 03:40:15,360
Versus the Sims.

2129
03:40:21,579 --> 03:40:22,860
Get wall dad back in there.

2130
03:40:28,459 --> 03:40:29,020
Sandler.

2131
03:40:30,030 --> 03:40:31,069
All the different germas.

2132
03:40:32,139 --> 03:40:33,340
All right how about wall dad.

2133
03:40:33,340 --> 03:40:34,139
Germa raptor.

2134
03:40:37,729 --> 03:40:47,090
And no.

2135
03:40:47,090 --> 03:40:47,729
Odd Michael.

2136
03:40:47,729 --> 03:40:48,530
Fuck odd Michael.

2137
03:40:48,530 --> 03:40:49,010
And Lou.

2138
03:40:49,569 --> 03:40:53,040
That sounds like a pretty good fight.

2139
03:40:54,930 --> 03:40:58,290
No Adam Sandler's been a part of like three of the last five matches.

2140
03:40:59,010 --> 03:41:02,510
All right let's do it.

2141
03:41:03,520 --> 03:41:04,559
Match options.

2142
03:41:04,559 --> 03:41:06,239
All right uh referee.

2143
03:41:07,200 --> 03:41:08,000
Whatever who cares.

2144
03:41:13,149 --> 03:41:15,469
We want Adam Sandler.

2145
03:41:15,469 --> 03:41:19,659
What a bunch of bums.

2146
03:41:21,299 --> 03:41:22,420
Lou is a hundred.

2147
03:41:23,059 --> 03:41:24,020
As he should be.

2148
03:41:24,739 --> 03:41:27,299
Oh it's actually a tag match.

2149
03:41:27,299 --> 03:41:30,579
Wall dad is in there first so it's not tornado tag.

2150
03:41:33,090 --> 03:41:33,729
Snickers.

2151
03:41:35,489 --> 03:41:38,049
Oh yeah that's like Snickers logos in the game.

2152
03:41:40,079 --> 03:41:42,770
Go with the elbow drop there for wall dad.

2153
03:41:43,409 --> 03:41:44,899
He's got that knee brace on.

2154
03:41:44,899 --> 03:41:45,860
He's got a bad knee.

2155
03:41:46,579 --> 03:41:51,459
Please beat him right now.

2156
03:41:51,459 --> 03:41:51,940
Wall dad.

2157
03:41:52,659 --> 03:41:55,260
Oh well.

2158
03:41:55,260 --> 03:41:57,420
Super Jax versus Snickers.

2159
03:41:57,420 --> 03:41:58,540
I'm not making.

2160
03:41:58,540 --> 03:41:59,180
That's it.

2161
03:41:59,180 --> 03:41:59,659
Game's over.

2162
03:42:04,110 --> 03:42:07,149
Wall dad somehow is destroying Jax.

2163
03:42:07,149 --> 03:42:11,229
No super Jax with the overhead throw there.

2164
03:42:15,440 --> 03:42:17,200
Super wall versus super Jax.

2165
03:42:17,200 --> 03:42:17,600
That's right.

2166
03:42:18,239 --> 03:42:21,010
Dragging him to the middle of the ring.

2167
03:42:21,010 --> 03:42:22,450
Super Jax is gonna grab his arm.

2168
03:42:23,250 --> 03:42:24,850
What's he doing here?

2169
03:42:24,850 --> 03:42:27,329
Oh of course the secret fucking technique.

2170
03:42:28,049 --> 03:42:31,469
Doesn't matter how strong you are that always works.

2171
03:42:32,030 --> 03:42:35,219
He's got wall dad in a submission here.

2172
03:42:36,020 --> 03:42:39,040
Hopefully get a tag in.

2173
03:42:39,760 --> 03:42:41,459
Otherwise wall dad looks like he could be.

2174
03:42:41,459 --> 03:42:43,940
No what a knee to the face of super Jax.

2175
03:42:44,579 --> 03:42:46,739
Two infinity gauntlets is not enough.

2176
03:42:46,819 --> 03:42:51,860
For a minecon 2013 gift bag with two stickers.

2177
03:42:52,420 --> 03:42:54,420
And a diamond pickaxe plastic toy.

2178
03:42:54,420 --> 03:42:55,139
It's not enough.

2179
03:42:55,700 --> 03:43:02,459
He's got dad instinct.

2180
03:43:05,709 --> 03:43:06,350
Nice.

2181
03:43:06,350 --> 03:43:08,430
What a just charging dash.

2182
03:43:08,430 --> 03:43:09,709
And here comes German Raptor.

2183
03:43:11,059 --> 03:43:12,340
The worst person you could have tagged in.

2184
03:43:12,340 --> 03:43:13,299
You should have tagged in Luke.

2185
03:43:13,940 --> 03:43:18,819
German Raptor now is going to get instantly power bombed.

2186
03:43:21,920 --> 03:43:22,639
Okay.

2187
03:43:22,639 --> 03:43:23,200
Good work.

2188
03:43:23,920 --> 03:43:24,479
Good work.

2189
03:43:25,040 --> 03:43:26,000
Shittiest thing ever.

2190
03:43:27,950 --> 03:43:29,709
He's just beating the shit out of his head.

2191
03:43:30,270 --> 03:43:31,729
He's already done.

2192
03:43:31,729 --> 03:43:32,049
He's dead.

2193
03:43:32,770 --> 03:43:33,250
Game over.

2194
03:43:33,889 --> 03:43:36,430
Come on.

2195
03:43:36,430 --> 03:43:37,709
Do like a Raptor move.

2196
03:43:43,280 --> 03:43:44,319
Fuck you super Jax.

2197
03:43:44,319 --> 03:43:45,680
You get two infinity gauntlets.

2198
03:43:45,680 --> 03:43:47,360
I get a mask from Walmart.

2199
03:43:48,239 --> 03:43:50,659
This is embarrassing again.

2200
03:43:52,159 --> 03:43:53,440
Get Lou Elbertson in there.

2201
03:43:53,440 --> 03:43:54,559
He at least has a chance.

2202
03:43:55,360 --> 03:44:01,819
German Raptor is about to go extinct.

2203
03:44:02,379 --> 03:44:04,209
Just stepping on his head.

2204
03:44:04,209 --> 03:44:05,170
Going to the top rope.

2205
03:44:05,170 --> 03:44:06,370
Somebody get in there please.

2206
03:44:11,629 --> 03:44:12,909
Oh he missed with a stomp.

2207
03:44:13,629 --> 03:44:15,219
This is German Raptor's chance.

2208
03:44:15,780 --> 03:44:16,500
Into the corner.

2209
03:44:17,600 --> 03:44:18,159
Tag him in.

2210
03:44:18,159 --> 03:44:19,440
Let's get a double team here.

2211
03:44:20,530 --> 03:44:21,250
There we go.

2212
03:44:21,250 --> 03:44:22,209
Beautiful.

2213
03:44:22,209 --> 03:44:25,409
Walledad German Raptor with a double swinging slacks.

2214
03:44:25,969 --> 03:44:26,690
Whatever that means.

2215
03:44:27,940 --> 03:44:28,440
Teamwork.

2216
03:44:32,479 --> 03:44:33,680
Walledad now going to the corner.

2217
03:44:33,680 --> 03:44:34,559
Super Jax now.

2218
03:44:34,559 --> 03:44:35,440
Why would you tag it?

2219
03:44:35,440 --> 03:44:36,799
Walledad is so tired.

2220
03:44:38,000 --> 03:44:39,120
Oh dear.

2221
03:44:39,120 --> 03:44:39,840
That's not good.

2222
03:44:39,840 --> 03:44:40,799
We got a one.

2223
03:44:40,799 --> 03:44:41,760
We've got only one.

2224
03:44:42,620 --> 03:44:43,120
Only one.

2225
03:44:45,600 --> 03:44:46,100
Trying to.

2226
03:44:47,040 --> 03:44:54,299
You got nobody to tag in Walled.

2227
03:44:55,200 --> 03:44:55,700
German.

2228
03:44:57,659 --> 03:44:59,180
What the fuck is this?

2229
03:45:01,329 --> 03:45:01,829
Oh no.

2230
03:45:02,450 --> 03:45:05,090
He just put his legs in the air and put them up and down.

2231
03:45:06,610 --> 03:45:07,649
Some super Jax.

2232
03:45:07,649 --> 03:45:08,370
Throw him outside.

2233
03:45:09,010 --> 03:45:10,049
Let's get Lou in here.

2234
03:45:10,049 --> 03:45:11,329
Walledad going to Lou maybe.

2235
03:45:11,329 --> 03:45:11,829
No.

2236
03:45:12,450 --> 03:45:15,200
Tagging back in German Raptor.

2237
03:45:16,770 --> 03:45:17,489
What is this?

2238
03:45:19,569 --> 03:45:20,930
German Raptor didn't do anything.

2239
03:45:22,159 --> 03:45:23,840
He pretended like he helped.

2240
03:45:23,840 --> 03:45:25,040
All he did was jump up the ropes.

2241
03:45:25,040 --> 03:45:25,540
That's it.

2242
03:45:26,799 --> 03:45:29,760
And look what happened.

2243
03:45:29,760 --> 03:45:30,799
Oh yeah.

2244
03:45:30,799 --> 03:45:31,360
Nice, nice.

2245
03:45:31,360 --> 03:45:32,399
Good work German Raptor.

2246
03:45:33,120 --> 03:45:33,920
Watch out for the riff.

2247
03:45:34,639 --> 03:45:38,399
Super Jax is going up top.

2248
03:45:38,959 --> 03:45:41,040
Going for another somersault pin here.

2249
03:45:41,040 --> 03:45:41,540
One.

2250
03:45:41,840 --> 03:45:42,639
That's all they're going to get.

2251
03:45:43,280 --> 03:45:47,360
Are we going to get even get to see Lou in this whole match?

2252
03:45:51,510 --> 03:45:52,309
He's 100.

2253
03:45:52,309 --> 03:45:54,709
He has 100 stats and he's just sitting out there hanging up.

2254
03:45:58,850 --> 03:45:59,649
That's right Lou.

2255
03:46:00,530 --> 03:46:01,170
Uncle Lou.

2256
03:46:02,719 --> 03:46:03,520
T-pose.

2257
03:46:06,149 --> 03:46:07,909
German Raptor has Jax in the corner.

2258
03:46:09,239 --> 03:46:10,840
You could have guessed that was going to happen.

2259
03:46:11,879 --> 03:46:15,000
Big crashing downward spiral into the mat there.

2260
03:46:15,000 --> 03:46:17,799
German Raptor is in a lot of trouble in the corner.

2261
03:46:19,079 --> 03:46:20,920
Super Jax is on the top rope again.

2262
03:46:20,920 --> 03:46:23,879
The same flipping scoop powerbomb thing.

2263
03:46:23,879 --> 03:46:25,079
And Walledad can't handle it.

2264
03:46:25,719 --> 03:46:27,000
Walledad saying this is bullshit.

2265
03:46:27,000 --> 03:46:28,040
He's got 100 stats.

2266
03:46:28,040 --> 03:46:28,680
It's not fair.

2267
03:46:32,360 --> 03:46:33,639
Walledad coming out of the walls.

2268
03:46:34,739 --> 03:46:36,100
Behind the wall you could say.

2269
03:46:36,819 --> 03:46:39,190
Look at this dad instinct.

2270
03:46:39,829 --> 03:46:40,469
Saved the day.

2271
03:46:41,559 --> 03:46:42,760
Now Jerma Jax.

2272
03:46:42,760 --> 03:46:44,920
Super Jax is going for the next snap.

2273
03:46:44,920 --> 03:46:45,559
Will he get it?

2274
03:46:46,200 --> 03:46:47,840
No he will not.

2275
03:46:47,840 --> 03:46:51,600
It's powering up here.

2276
03:46:51,600 --> 03:46:52,719
The two infinity gauntlets.

2277
03:46:53,280 --> 03:46:55,280
He's got the mind stone and the power stone.

2278
03:46:55,280 --> 03:46:57,440
He can control all of reality.

2279
03:46:57,440 --> 03:46:59,440
And that's all it took was one, two punches.

2280
03:47:00,159 --> 03:47:02,739
And a badly to back suplex on his neck.

2281
03:47:05,239 --> 03:47:09,079
The people reaching out desperately to get a tag from German Raptor.

2282
03:47:09,079 --> 03:47:12,200
They know he's the shittiest character in this entire rumble.

2283
03:47:13,319 --> 03:47:14,760
No German Raptor.

2284
03:47:14,760 --> 03:47:15,079
No.

2285
03:47:15,079 --> 03:47:16,200
Nobody cares.

2286
03:47:16,200 --> 03:47:17,000
It's not cool.

2287
03:47:17,799 --> 03:47:18,840
Tag out.

2288
03:47:18,840 --> 03:47:19,879
You have to tag out now.

2289
03:47:20,520 --> 03:47:25,700
Before you keep embarrassing yourself.

2290
03:47:26,500 --> 03:47:27,379
Tag Lu in.

2291
03:47:28,370 --> 03:47:28,930
Tag out.

2292
03:47:30,389 --> 03:47:30,790
No.

2293
03:47:30,790 --> 03:47:32,309
You stop proving yourself.

2294
03:47:32,870 --> 03:47:35,030
This is the worst joke you've ever made.

2295
03:47:35,030 --> 03:47:36,149
Stop trying to prove it.

2296
03:47:36,149 --> 03:47:36,950
It's worth doing.

2297
03:47:38,040 --> 03:47:39,079
See look what happened.

2298
03:47:39,719 --> 03:47:41,479
He's like no I can make it funny.

2299
03:47:41,479 --> 03:47:42,920
I'll go.

2300
03:47:42,920 --> 03:47:44,120
No it's not funny.

2301
03:47:44,120 --> 03:47:44,760
It's not gonna happen.

2302
03:47:44,760 --> 03:47:45,559
It's not gonna be funny.

2303
03:48:09,350 --> 03:48:10,549
Jerma gets out of the top row.

2304
03:48:10,549 --> 03:48:12,790
What a reversal there by Jerma Raptor.

2305
03:48:13,590 --> 03:48:14,870
All the shit we just talked.

2306
03:48:16,340 --> 03:48:18,659
Oh boy he got hit right in the skull.

2307
03:48:20,840 --> 03:48:22,600
You don't stand a chance against Super Jax.

2308
03:48:22,600 --> 03:48:23,479
Use your teammates.

2309
03:48:23,479 --> 03:48:25,239
Use your friends and your family members.

2310
03:48:25,239 --> 03:48:26,920
There's one right next to you with a hundred stats.

2311
03:48:26,920 --> 03:48:27,879
Stop staring at him.

2312
03:48:31,760 --> 03:48:32,719
He scoops him up.

2313
03:48:32,719 --> 03:48:33,600
How can he pick him up?

2314
03:48:33,600 --> 03:48:34,719
He's like a thousand pounds.

2315
03:48:35,600 --> 03:48:36,559
Holy shit.

2316
03:48:37,840 --> 03:48:38,639
Holy shit.

2317
03:48:40,079 --> 03:48:41,600
He's got a lot to prove.

2318
03:48:41,600 --> 03:48:42,799
Drag him to the middle of the ring.

2319
03:48:43,360 --> 03:48:58,959
And he's going for the pin.

2320
03:48:59,520 --> 03:49:02,290
Can we get a one two.

2321
03:49:02,290 --> 03:49:03,329
Oh a two count.

2322
03:49:03,329 --> 03:49:04,129
Oh unbelievable.

2323
03:49:04,129 --> 03:49:05,250
I can't believe he got out of that one.

2324
03:49:06,049 --> 03:49:08,370
Jerma Raptor had a chance there.

2325
03:49:08,370 --> 03:49:09,170
A small chance.

2326
03:49:09,170 --> 03:49:10,770
Oh what a lariat with a leg.

2327
03:49:10,770 --> 03:49:12,209
A leg lariat as you would say.

2328
03:49:13,090 --> 03:49:13,969
By Super Jax.

2329
03:49:17,299 --> 03:49:17,940
There it is.

2330
03:49:18,659 --> 03:49:19,379
There it is.

2331
03:49:19,379 --> 03:49:20,819
The spindy doodle.

2332
03:49:20,819 --> 03:49:23,299
I've said that word like 30 times already.

2333
03:49:23,299 --> 03:49:24,260
It's not tagging.

2334
03:49:25,059 --> 03:49:25,940
Wall dad's coming in.

2335
03:49:28,370 --> 03:49:30,209
Lou is essentially a manager right now.

2336
03:49:30,209 --> 03:49:31,889
And then Super Jax is like fuck this.

2337
03:49:31,889 --> 03:49:33,729
I'll see you next time or the next episode.

2338
03:49:33,729 --> 03:49:34,930
And it's the next episode.

2339
03:49:34,930 --> 03:49:35,809
It's the next episode.

2340
03:49:36,450 --> 03:49:46,790
And there it is.

2341
03:49:46,790 --> 03:49:47,350
He got him in the back.

2342
03:49:48,309 --> 03:49:50,389
Backwards elbow by wall dad.

2343
03:49:52,229 --> 03:49:53,829
Scoops him up with a choke slam.

2344
03:49:53,829 --> 03:49:54,950
Could that be it?

2345
03:49:54,950 --> 03:49:55,670
That's one.

2346
03:49:56,709 --> 03:49:57,270
That's two.

2347
03:49:58,149 --> 03:49:59,270
Can he get the third one?

2348
03:49:59,989 --> 03:50:00,790
He got the third one.

2349
03:50:01,510 --> 03:50:03,360
Can wall dad close this one out?

2350
03:50:03,360 --> 03:50:05,520
Can it be the end of the situation here for Super Jax?

2351
03:50:07,319 --> 03:50:09,159
Can we get to the end of the season already?

2352
03:50:10,840 --> 03:50:11,879
Into the corner he goes.

2353
03:50:12,760 --> 03:50:13,479
Wall dad.

2354
03:50:14,200 --> 03:50:32,549
And he gets a pin.

2355
03:50:32,549 --> 03:50:33,430
And a power bump.

2356
03:50:33,989 --> 03:50:34,549
Wall dad.

2357
03:50:35,510 --> 03:50:36,709
He's got him in the.

2358
03:50:37,190 --> 03:50:37,829
Sacrific.

2359
03:50:37,829 --> 03:50:38,389
There it is.

2360
03:50:39,750 --> 03:50:40,870
The sacrificial wall.

2361
03:50:41,590 --> 03:50:45,010
I can't believe he just did it.

2362
03:50:46,149 --> 03:50:47,989
That's called the wall knockdown.

2363
03:50:47,989 --> 03:50:49,670
The sacrificial wall knockdown.

2364
03:50:50,309 --> 03:51:00,440
Here comes a pin.

2365
03:51:01,959 --> 03:51:02,280
One.

2366
03:51:03,000 --> 03:51:04,360
Oh, only one.

2367
03:51:04,360 --> 03:51:05,159
I wonder why.

2368
03:51:05,799 --> 03:51:07,159
I wonder why that happened.

2369
03:51:09,159 --> 03:51:11,719
Maybe if you pinned him after doing the move.

2370
03:51:12,280 --> 03:51:14,610
It might not have happened.

2371
03:51:14,610 --> 03:51:16,129
As wall dad goes into the corner.

2372
03:51:17,430 --> 03:51:18,309
We've got us.

2373
03:51:18,309 --> 03:51:19,670
Oh, he did the diaper.

2374
03:51:19,670 --> 03:51:20,950
That's a super diaper.

2375
03:51:22,020 --> 03:51:24,739
Super Jax for the super diaper on his super fucking face.

2376
03:51:26,479 --> 03:51:27,040
Right hand.

2377
03:51:28,579 --> 03:51:29,459
Got him on the neck.

2378
03:51:29,459 --> 03:51:30,180
Spinning back.

2379
03:51:30,180 --> 03:51:31,459
Backward suplex.

2380
03:51:31,459 --> 03:51:32,180
Into the diaper.

2381
03:51:32,819 --> 03:51:34,260
He has multiple diaper moves.

2382
03:51:34,819 --> 03:51:36,360
That's diaper two he calls it.

2383
03:51:37,280 --> 03:51:38,239
2.0.

2384
03:51:38,239 --> 03:51:38,739
Whoa!

2385
03:51:39,440 --> 03:51:46,440
Uh oh, he's got him in the bad boy.

2386
03:51:46,440 --> 03:51:47,719
He's like, you're a bad boy.

2387
03:51:48,360 --> 03:51:51,649
Is this gonna be it?

2388
03:51:51,649 --> 03:51:52,850
Can he end it?

2389
03:51:52,850 --> 03:51:54,049
With the bad boy?

2390
03:52:01,170 --> 03:52:02,290
No, he's not.

2391
03:52:02,290 --> 03:52:03,729
He's gonna get power bombed.

2392
03:52:05,620 --> 03:52:06,120
One.

2393
03:52:06,819 --> 03:52:07,319
Two.

2394
03:52:08,180 --> 03:52:09,459
Oh, Lou made an attempt.

2395
03:52:13,909 --> 03:52:16,069
Somebody just wrote, I'm unfollowing.

2396
03:52:17,200 --> 03:52:17,700
Nice.

2397
03:52:24,049 --> 03:52:25,569
Wall dad catches the leg.

2398
03:52:27,250 --> 03:52:27,969
Can he get him?

2399
03:52:28,930 --> 03:52:30,450
With the backwards neck breaking.

2400
03:52:34,309 --> 03:52:35,989
He's getting energy from twitch chat.

2401
03:52:37,399 --> 03:52:39,879
Wall dad should have been the guy who picked up two lariat.

2402
03:52:40,840 --> 03:52:41,340
Three.

2403
03:52:42,360 --> 03:52:43,159
That's gonna be it.

2404
03:52:44,920 --> 03:52:46,920
He calls everyone the sledgehammer.

2405
03:52:46,920 --> 03:52:50,450
He's gonna do it again?

2406
03:52:51,090 --> 03:52:53,409
No, that's 640 pounds.

2407
03:52:53,409 --> 03:52:55,889
You gotta be a goddamn titan to be able to pick that up.

2408
03:52:58,840 --> 03:53:01,639
Lou is watching ever so patiently as supergex.

2409
03:53:04,520 --> 03:53:05,959
Here comes germa raptor.

2410
03:53:06,520 --> 03:53:07,959
What the hell are they doing?

2411
03:53:07,959 --> 03:53:11,719
He's helping him getting on his shoulders.

2412
03:53:11,719 --> 03:53:13,719
Germa raptor is going for the raptor lunge.

2413
03:53:15,829 --> 03:53:16,549
That's gonna be it.

2414
03:53:21,219 --> 03:53:21,860
Teamwork!

2415
03:53:23,120 --> 03:53:26,559
Can they put an end to supergex once and for all as three?

2416
03:53:26,559 --> 03:53:27,360
I mean two.

2417
03:53:28,000 --> 03:53:29,520
Because Lou hasn't done anything.

2418
03:53:29,520 --> 03:53:31,040
He's stood there the whole time.

2419
03:53:31,040 --> 03:53:32,799
No, he's gonna get power bombed again.

2420
03:53:32,799 --> 03:53:33,760
Hey, how about this one?

2421
03:53:33,760 --> 03:53:34,239
Remember that?

2422
03:53:36,680 --> 03:53:37,639
Hey, get out of here.

2423
03:53:37,639 --> 03:53:38,200
I'm Lou.

2424
03:53:38,200 --> 03:53:39,239
I'll do something once.

2425
03:53:40,530 --> 03:53:41,170
Watch my looks.

2426
03:53:41,170 --> 03:53:42,450
Isn't that a cool kick?

2427
03:53:43,090 --> 03:53:52,469
Going to the top rope is supergex slowly though.

2428
03:53:52,469 --> 03:53:53,430
What's the move here?

2429
03:53:55,139 --> 03:53:56,100
What's the move here?

2430
03:53:57,809 --> 03:53:58,850
Oh dear.

2431
03:53:58,850 --> 03:53:59,250
This is...

2432
03:53:59,889 --> 03:54:00,370
That's it.

2433
03:54:00,370 --> 03:54:01,569
That has to be the end.

2434
03:54:01,569 --> 03:54:03,809
That's 20,000 pounds on his chest.

2435
03:54:03,809 --> 03:54:05,010
He doesn't have a chest anymore.

2436
03:54:05,010 --> 03:54:05,969
Wall dad coming in.

2437
03:54:06,920 --> 03:54:08,520
Catching his dad instinct.

2438
03:54:08,520 --> 03:54:09,969
Stay with my son.

2439
03:54:10,530 --> 03:54:11,750
How dare you?

2440
03:54:14,209 --> 03:54:14,690
Oh shit.

2441
03:54:14,690 --> 03:54:17,729
My like four-year-old almost fell down off a cliff.

2442
03:54:17,729 --> 03:54:19,649
I got him though in that Reddit video.

2443
03:54:20,819 --> 03:54:21,299
I caught him.

2444
03:54:21,299 --> 03:54:22,659
I got a wall dad instinct.

2445
03:54:27,379 --> 03:54:28,260
What the fuck?

2446
03:54:33,559 --> 03:54:34,120
Oh, it's okay.

2447
03:54:34,120 --> 03:54:35,239
I'll go back to Reddit.

2448
03:54:35,879 --> 03:54:43,989
Turbo raptor with a toss.

2449
03:54:43,989 --> 03:54:44,950
And he's getting ready.

2450
03:54:45,750 --> 03:54:47,670
He's getting ready for his signature move.

2451
03:54:47,670 --> 03:54:48,389
Oh, there it was.

2452
03:54:48,389 --> 03:54:49,590
I didn't have time to tell you what it was.

2453
03:54:55,670 --> 03:54:57,350
Into the corner, Jex goes.

2454
03:54:59,010 --> 03:55:00,209
Who is he going to tag in?

2455
03:55:00,209 --> 03:55:01,409
Oh, I wonder.

2456
03:55:01,409 --> 03:55:01,969
Is it going to be...

2457
03:55:28,149 --> 03:55:28,870
A suplex.

2458
03:55:29,430 --> 03:55:33,639
Pulling him into the center of the ring.

2459
03:55:49,590 --> 03:55:49,909
One.

2460
03:55:50,899 --> 03:55:51,139
Two.

2461
03:55:53,540 --> 03:55:55,760
That's too bad.

2462
03:55:55,760 --> 03:55:57,680
Germa raptor going for a pin.

2463
03:55:57,680 --> 03:55:58,719
Didn't get it though.

2464
03:55:59,360 --> 03:56:00,319
Into the corner again.

2465
03:56:03,719 --> 03:56:07,799
Here comes Lou Albertson to stop this and end the fucking match.

2466
03:56:07,799 --> 03:56:08,920
Well, they bumped into each other.

2467
03:56:09,399 --> 03:56:10,280
They're going for it again.

2468
03:56:11,670 --> 03:56:12,709
He loves his uncle.

2469
03:56:13,430 --> 03:56:14,549
It's his favorite uncle.

2470
03:56:16,469 --> 03:56:17,829
Lou Albertson coming in.

2471
03:56:18,959 --> 03:56:20,000
Let's see if he can...

2472
03:56:20,000 --> 03:56:21,360
He's doing the arm pull.

2473
03:56:22,000 --> 03:56:23,520
He used to work in a meat factory.

2474
03:56:24,979 --> 03:56:26,180
He knows how to pull chicken.

2475
03:56:28,549 --> 03:56:29,510
Up to the top rope.

2476
03:56:29,510 --> 03:56:31,110
He's finally got his pounding his chest.

2477
03:56:31,110 --> 03:56:31,590
That's right.

2478
03:56:39,700 --> 03:56:42,100
Oh, he got reversed by super Jex.

2479
03:56:44,049 --> 03:56:45,250
He makes a great pulled chicken.

2480
03:56:45,250 --> 03:56:46,770
He brings it to fucking Thanksgiving every year.

2481
03:56:46,770 --> 03:56:48,129
We don't do turkey.

2482
03:56:48,129 --> 03:56:48,850
We do chicken.

2483
03:56:49,409 --> 03:56:52,420
We do fucking Boston market chicken.

2484
03:56:53,059 --> 03:56:55,399
We go to the Boston market and we get chicken.

2485
03:56:56,120 --> 03:56:57,799
Corner to corner, Lou Albertson.

2486
03:56:58,819 --> 03:56:59,379
That's two.

2487
03:57:00,100 --> 03:57:01,510
Can he go for a third?

2488
03:57:02,850 --> 03:57:03,809
Into the third corner.

2489
03:57:15,920 --> 03:57:16,959
Go after him?

2490
03:57:16,959 --> 03:57:17,840
Do I fight him?

2491
03:57:22,319 --> 03:57:24,159
Do I fight the guy in the corner?

2492
03:57:24,159 --> 03:57:25,120
He'll get him.

2493
03:57:25,120 --> 03:57:25,680
I don't know.

2494
03:57:25,680 --> 03:57:26,079
Should I?

2495
03:57:28,879 --> 03:57:29,280
Maybe?

2496
03:57:29,280 --> 03:57:30,239
I don't know.

2497
03:57:30,239 --> 03:57:30,959
He gets it!

2498
03:57:30,959 --> 03:57:31,440
Right hand!

2499
03:57:32,159 --> 03:57:32,799
Lou Albertson!

2500
03:57:33,760 --> 03:57:35,920
And that's called the Thanksgiving Turkey Chicken Dinner.

2501
03:57:36,559 --> 03:57:37,750
Didn't even get a chance.

2502
03:57:42,680 --> 03:57:44,680
Oh, he threw his hand into the ground.

2503
03:57:44,680 --> 03:57:45,479
Unbelievable.

2504
03:57:46,280 --> 03:57:47,889
Going for the neck break.

2505
03:57:48,530 --> 03:57:52,129
Can somebody finally get the neck break to end a match?

2506
03:57:53,299 --> 03:57:54,100
Nope.

2507
03:57:54,100 --> 03:57:57,010
Go for it again.

2508
03:57:57,649 --> 03:58:01,649
No, he gets reversed in a clothesline by super Jex on Lou Albertson.

2509
03:58:01,649 --> 03:58:07,030
Albertson trying to take his head clean off of his shoulders.

2510
03:58:07,750 --> 03:58:09,430
Did not seem to work in this scenario.

2511
03:58:09,430 --> 03:58:10,309
Now we've got...

2512
03:58:10,309 --> 03:58:13,110
Oh, he's dragging him around like fucking dirty underwear on the ground.

2513
03:58:13,829 --> 03:58:15,489
He's kind of by the neck.

2514
03:58:15,489 --> 03:58:17,409
That's a very bad position to be in.

2515
03:58:18,049 --> 03:58:20,360
Is he going to break Lou's neck?

2516
03:58:20,360 --> 03:58:20,760
No!

2517
03:58:20,760 --> 03:58:22,200
Lou reversed it!

2518
03:58:22,200 --> 03:58:22,920
Somehow!

2519
03:58:22,920 --> 03:58:23,479
Ooh!

2520
03:58:23,479 --> 03:58:25,479
Took a slap into his face!

2521
03:58:25,479 --> 03:58:26,280
Oh, my face!

2522
03:58:27,479 --> 03:58:29,959
He's got a backwards suplex into the diaper!

2523
03:58:29,959 --> 03:58:31,319
The dupe diaper 2.0!

2524
03:58:32,120 --> 03:58:38,819
Why would you...

2525
03:58:38,819 --> 03:58:39,379
All right.

2526
03:58:39,379 --> 03:58:39,700
One!

2527
03:58:40,340 --> 03:58:42,819
Not even a one count on Lou Albertson.

2528
03:58:42,819 --> 03:58:48,500
Why is every move the diaper?

2529
03:58:49,059 --> 03:58:50,260
That's the diaper 2.0.

2530
03:58:50,260 --> 03:58:51,459
The diaper 1 is the double...

2531
03:58:52,180 --> 03:58:53,860
The feet jump into the ground.

2532
03:58:53,860 --> 03:58:55,139
He jumps in the air and kicks you.

2533
03:58:55,700 --> 03:58:56,739
Diaper 1, diaper 2.

2534
03:58:58,979 --> 03:59:00,739
Just taunting Lou Albertson here.

2535
03:59:02,530 --> 03:59:04,450
As Lou, it does not look good.

2536
03:59:04,450 --> 03:59:07,889
He's got great stats, but he can't go up against the Infinity Gauntlet.

2537
03:59:07,889 --> 03:59:09,010
He throws him outside.

2538
03:59:09,010 --> 03:59:10,129
He doesn't give a fuck.

2539
03:59:10,770 --> 03:59:12,079
He's going to win?

2540
03:59:12,079 --> 03:59:12,639
No, he's going to wait.

2541
03:59:12,639 --> 03:59:13,440
Is he going to go up top?

2542
03:59:14,000 --> 03:59:15,520
He's like, I like this one better.

2543
03:59:15,520 --> 03:59:16,479
He's up top.

2544
03:59:16,479 --> 03:59:18,479
Is Jermaraptor going to cause a problem here for him?

2545
03:59:18,479 --> 03:59:20,079
No, I would go like this one.

2546
03:59:21,159 --> 03:59:21,639
No, no.

2547
03:59:21,639 --> 03:59:23,879
I think I'm going to do this one.

2548
03:59:25,299 --> 03:59:26,500
Let me try this one.

2549
03:59:26,500 --> 03:59:27,000
No.

2550
03:59:28,899 --> 03:59:29,700
Top left part is better.

2551
03:59:30,659 --> 03:59:32,100
No, I think I'll just go out there.

2552
03:59:32,100 --> 03:59:34,340
My brain is fucking adult Swiss cheese.

2553
03:59:37,700 --> 03:59:38,659
And there he goes.

2554
03:59:38,659 --> 03:59:40,420
Lou Albertson goes down.

2555
03:59:40,420 --> 03:59:41,459
Now we got two count.

2556
03:59:41,459 --> 03:59:42,739
20 count means the end of the match.

2557
03:59:44,079 --> 03:59:45,600
Nice reversal into the balls.

2558
03:59:46,530 --> 03:59:49,319
Will it be enough to stop Super Jex?

2559
03:59:49,319 --> 03:59:50,680
I don't think so.

2560
03:59:50,680 --> 03:59:53,540
He's going to throw him into the crowd.

2561
03:59:53,540 --> 03:59:56,239
No, just into the banister here.

2562
03:59:56,239 --> 04:00:01,040
Five seconds have elapsed.

2563
04:00:01,040 --> 04:00:03,200
Right hand, left hand, right hand.

2564
04:00:03,200 --> 04:00:04,159
This is bad.

2565
04:00:04,159 --> 04:00:05,120
This is really bad.

2566
04:00:09,170 --> 04:00:09,969
Oh, come on.

2567
04:00:09,969 --> 04:00:12,290
A count out is literally the worst thing you could ever do.

2568
04:00:13,159 --> 04:00:14,760
Why is the ref not counting?

2569
04:00:14,760 --> 04:00:16,440
That was the longest eight seconds I've ever seen

2570
04:00:16,440 --> 04:00:19,350
in the history of the German arena.

2571
04:00:19,350 --> 04:00:20,790
And there goes Jerm-

2572
04:00:22,309 --> 04:00:23,590
Jermat Jex is in the ring.

2573
04:00:40,850 --> 04:00:43,090
Oh, make sure you show Lou clapping though.

2574
04:00:43,090 --> 04:00:43,649
That's great.

2575
04:00:44,209 --> 04:03:42,600
He doesn't need to be maxed.

2576
04:03:42,600 --> 04:04:13,920
He doesn't need that.

2577
04:04:13,920 --> 04:04:17,120
There's a wall dad, and here's a wall chat.

2578
04:04:17,280 --> 04:04:18,000
2.0.

2579
04:04:23,889 --> 04:04:24,610
What's the difference?

2580
04:04:24,610 --> 04:04:43,489
You have a glowing hat.

2581
04:04:43,489 --> 04:04:46,200
You can't beat Minecon 2013.

2582
04:04:46,200 --> 04:04:47,639
TLC match.

2583
04:04:47,639 --> 04:04:49,559
Wall chat 2.0 versus Jerm-

2584
04:04:49,559 --> 04:04:50,760
It's Super Jex.

2585
04:04:50,760 --> 04:04:58,040
Wall dad.

2586
04:04:58,040 --> 04:05:00,040
The only thing that needs to glow is his helmet.

2587
04:05:01,440 --> 04:05:04,319
Look, you can't even fucking do anything versus Minecon.

2588
04:05:05,120 --> 04:05:06,819
Remember when they announced sheep?

2589
04:05:07,379 --> 04:05:08,500
They're like wolves.

2590
04:05:10,149 --> 04:05:10,950
He was there for that.

2591
04:05:12,530 --> 04:05:13,969
He stood in line.

2592
04:05:13,969 --> 04:05:18,180
Hey, my son's like a real big fan of your YouTube channel.

2593
04:05:18,819 --> 04:05:20,819
Do you mind if I take a picture with you?

2594
04:05:20,819 --> 04:05:21,700
He was there for that.

2595
04:05:21,700 --> 04:05:22,340
Don't you understand?

2596
04:05:31,479 --> 04:05:35,360
Let's get some tables in here.

2597
04:05:35,360 --> 04:05:37,280
Do a mega version rumble.

2598
04:05:37,280 --> 04:05:38,559
That would take so long.

2599
04:05:41,000 --> 04:05:42,440
Hey, I mean, like, I know.

2600
04:05:42,440 --> 04:05:44,520
Hey, I just want to say that, you know,

2601
04:05:46,319 --> 04:05:48,959
little Jason is like such a huge fan of your channel.

2602
04:05:49,600 --> 04:05:53,200
He really loved when you played the Hunger Games.

2603
04:05:53,840 --> 04:05:56,319
Do you mind if I get like a picture with you?

2604
04:05:56,319 --> 04:05:57,440
Which is, well, him, not me.

2605
04:05:58,239 --> 04:05:58,719
Thanks, man.

2606
04:06:10,000 --> 04:06:11,920
Minecraft Hunger Games.

2607
04:06:11,920 --> 04:06:15,280
I'm not going to play Minecraft music.

2608
04:06:15,280 --> 04:06:17,280
This is probably the last match of the night.

2609
04:06:25,360 --> 04:06:28,639
Fucking my, no, what the hell just happened?

2610
04:06:29,440 --> 04:06:32,739
That was the equivalent of two planets colliding

2611
04:06:32,739 --> 04:06:34,340
and now they're outside under the tables.

2612
04:06:34,340 --> 04:06:35,700
The commentators are getting up.

2613
04:06:36,340 --> 04:06:39,750
We got a table from Super Jex,

2614
04:06:39,750 --> 04:06:42,389
but wall Chad 2.0 is going to stop that from happening.

2615
04:06:44,879 --> 04:06:46,479
They're bigger than the tables.

2616
04:06:47,040 --> 04:06:54,309
Uh-oh, where is Super Jex going?

2617
04:06:55,479 --> 04:06:57,079
Possibly to the ladder, it seems.

2618
04:06:57,879 --> 04:06:58,760
Yep, you got to get that.

2619
04:06:58,760 --> 04:06:59,879
You got to get the money up top.

2620
04:07:00,600 --> 04:07:03,319
You got to get your free two tickets to Minecon.

2621
04:07:06,790 --> 04:07:08,950
And wall dad is getting a table.

2622
04:07:09,510 --> 04:07:15,190
There is the ladder set up.

2623
04:07:15,190 --> 04:07:16,629
Nice dodge by Super Jex.

2624
04:07:17,350 --> 04:07:20,149
Wall Chad can't seem to get it right into the table.

2625
04:07:22,209 --> 04:07:24,370
Now that is devastating.

2626
04:07:25,010 --> 04:07:29,750
Super Jex is going to the outside for some reason.

2627
04:07:29,750 --> 04:07:30,469
I'm not sure why.

2628
04:07:31,270 --> 04:07:33,989
Yeah, wall dad brought out his own wall

2629
04:07:34,790 --> 04:07:42,229
and wall dad is going and getting the briefcase.

2630
04:07:42,229 --> 04:07:48,979
Super Jex is an observer

2631
04:07:50,819 --> 04:07:57,000
and he's fiddling with the hook there

2632
04:07:57,719 --> 04:08:02,149
and trying to get it.

2633
04:08:02,149 --> 04:08:02,790
It's a tough hook.

2634
04:08:04,290 --> 04:08:04,770
I almost got it.

2635
04:08:04,770 --> 04:08:05,969
No, he kind of fucked it up there.

2636
04:08:05,969 --> 04:08:07,250
He's going to try it again.

2637
04:08:09,600 --> 04:08:10,639
It's a tough lock.

2638
04:08:11,360 --> 04:08:14,520
Might take four, two sets of hands there.

2639
04:08:14,520 --> 04:08:15,879
No, he's got it.

2640
04:08:15,879 --> 04:08:16,680
Here it is.

2641
04:08:33,700 --> 04:08:35,139
Yeah, this is for my son.

2642
04:08:36,340 --> 04:08:38,020
Yeah, I can't believe it.

2643
04:08:38,899 --> 04:08:42,180
This is signed by all the YouTubers.

2644
04:08:42,819 --> 04:09:21,360
That's it.

2645
04:09:27,110 --> 04:09:32,850
I don't know what the hell that was

2646
04:09:33,489 --> 04:09:40,690
but we haven't done that before.

2647
04:09:41,329 --> 04:09:42,069
That was fun.

2648
04:09:44,100 --> 04:09:46,500
Well, the first like two hour and a half of the stream

2649
04:09:46,500 --> 04:09:47,540
was like the real shit

2650
04:09:47,540 --> 04:09:50,739
and then the last like three hours was bullshit.

2651
04:09:51,299 --> 04:09:52,239
But it was fun.

2652
04:09:54,399 --> 04:09:55,680
Thank you so much everybody for coming.

2653
04:09:56,399 --> 04:09:58,950
There were a lot.

2654
04:09:58,950 --> 04:10:01,190
I there was so many people here tonight.

2655
04:10:01,190 --> 04:10:02,069
I can't even believe it.

2656
04:10:02,069 --> 04:10:04,389
There's almost 10,000 people at the stream concurrently.

2657
04:10:05,430 --> 04:10:06,629
That's fucking out of control.

2658
04:10:07,750 --> 04:10:10,340
So thank you for participating.

2659
04:10:10,340 --> 04:10:11,459
Thanks for being part of the community

2660
04:10:13,120 --> 04:10:17,360
because a lot of these random characters are, you know,

2661
04:10:18,000 --> 04:10:19,760
at least half of them, more than half of them

2662
04:10:19,760 --> 04:10:21,440
because we thought they were fun and funny.

2663
04:10:21,440 --> 04:10:21,920
You know what I mean?

2664
04:10:22,879 --> 04:10:28,000
So thank you for participating everybody.

2665
04:10:28,639 --> 04:10:30,120
It's always a blast.

2666
04:10:32,610 --> 04:10:33,090
Good night.

2667
04:10:34,239 --> 04:10:35,120
Take care of yourself.

2668
04:10:35,120 --> 04:10:36,639
I will see you guys on Tuesday.

2669
04:10:37,440 --> 04:10:38,840
I'm going to take tomorrow off

2670
04:10:38,840 --> 04:10:41,879
because I really the last four days straight

2671
04:10:42,680 --> 04:10:44,290
I've kind of been making characters.

2672
04:10:45,250 --> 04:10:47,090
So I'm going to take tomorrow off.

2673
04:10:47,090 --> 04:10:47,969
I'll see you on Tuesday.

2674
04:10:47,969 --> 04:10:50,610
We'll probably, you know, I have no idea

2675
04:10:50,610 --> 04:10:51,969
what the fuck we're going to do on Tuesday.

2676
04:10:51,969 --> 04:10:52,690
That's a good question.

2677
04:10:53,729 --> 04:10:59,670
But if you're new, thanks for dropping by.

2678
04:11:00,899 --> 04:11:03,219
If not, then hey, good to see you again.

2679
04:11:04,690 --> 04:11:06,530
We're probably going to have fucked up credits

2680
04:11:06,530 --> 04:11:11,600
because of the I had stream labs turned off

2681
04:11:11,600 --> 04:11:13,440
just for the sake of because I wanted to know

2682
04:11:13,440 --> 04:11:15,920
I have no notifications on the stream.

2683
04:11:16,000 --> 04:11:19,280
So this might be difficult to do this.

2684
04:11:19,280 --> 04:11:19,760
Let's see.

2685
04:11:20,879 --> 04:11:22,879
I think it's still here.

2686
04:11:26,950 --> 04:11:27,430
Is it though?

2687
04:11:30,290 --> 04:11:31,250
Try Soul Calibur.

2688
04:11:31,250 --> 04:11:33,010
You know, I've heard here's the thing about Soul Calibur.

2689
04:11:33,729 --> 04:11:35,329
It's got a really great character creator

2690
04:11:35,329 --> 04:11:37,969
but I would get to the game, the actual

2691
04:11:37,969 --> 04:11:39,969
we'd make like five characters in Soul Calibur

2692
04:11:40,770 --> 04:11:43,649
and then I'd get to the video game and go,

2693
04:11:46,440 --> 04:11:47,319
I don't know about this.

2694
04:11:48,040 --> 04:11:52,899
But see you guys on Tuesday if you're taking off.

2695
04:11:52,899 --> 04:11:53,860
Thanks for sticking around.

2696
04:11:53,860 --> 04:12:01,250
Let me see if I can pull up the at least the bits.

2697
04:12:01,250 --> 04:12:01,649
Let's see.

2698
04:12:06,870 --> 04:12:08,069
Soul Calibur is great.

2699
04:12:12,209 --> 04:12:13,170
It's for PC, right?

2700
04:12:13,889 --> 04:12:15,399
Soul Calibur is PC.

2701
04:12:16,120 --> 04:12:20,819
But we do this once like every eight or nine months

2702
04:12:20,819 --> 04:12:23,860
once there's enough characters or new ideas

2703
04:12:23,860 --> 04:12:24,819
to put into a rumble.

2704
04:12:25,620 --> 04:12:27,379
So thank you so much everybody for sticking around.

2705
04:12:29,989 --> 04:12:33,430
I don't have any of the subs I don't think.

2706
04:12:33,430 --> 04:12:33,909
Let's see.

2707
04:12:35,030 --> 04:12:36,739
I'll run the credits either way.

2708
04:12:37,379 --> 04:12:40,420
Because I didn't have streamlabs going but it's okay.

2709
04:12:41,540 --> 04:12:43,909
No, actually, how the fuck did I delete it?

2710
04:12:43,909 --> 04:12:44,790
What the hell am I doing?

2711
04:12:45,430 --> 04:12:50,799
But people gave so much money tonight.

2712
04:12:50,799 --> 04:12:52,799
There was at least $50 from Nay.

2713
04:12:53,360 --> 04:12:54,239
From Nay means Nay.

2714
04:12:54,239 --> 04:12:55,280
Thanks for $50.

2715
04:12:56,079 --> 04:12:57,920
Stream is the best birthday present ever.

2716
04:12:57,920 --> 04:12:58,719
Thank you so much.

2717
04:12:59,600 --> 04:13:00,879
$10 from Riggle Rat.

2718
04:13:01,440 --> 04:13:02,399
They say Jax God.

2719
04:13:02,399 --> 04:13:04,239
$10 from Elizabeth.

2720
04:13:04,239 --> 04:13:05,120
I love you stuff so much.

2721
04:13:05,120 --> 04:13:06,639
Please take these bits.

2722
04:13:06,639 --> 04:13:07,040
Thank you.

2723
04:13:13,700 --> 04:13:14,260
OBS.

2724
04:13:14,260 --> 04:13:15,620
Make sure you get OBS Studio.

2725
04:13:16,340 --> 04:13:20,280
Thank you guys.

2726
04:13:21,000 --> 04:13:23,379
OBS Hijack.

2727
04:13:24,709 --> 04:13:28,719
On Tuesday we'll be live again.

2728
04:13:29,520 --> 04:13:31,889
Peaked at 9,000 viewers this stream.

2729
04:13:31,889 --> 04:13:32,610
Holy shit.

2730
04:13:33,409 --> 04:13:34,049
Are you kidding me?

2731
04:13:35,729 --> 04:13:39,600
I saw like eight.

2732
04:13:40,479 --> 04:13:41,040
God damn.

2733
04:13:41,760 --> 04:13:43,299
Thank you everybody.

2734
04:13:43,860 --> 04:13:44,879
Hope you had fun.

2735
04:13:45,600 --> 04:13:47,430
9,085.

2736
04:13:48,819 --> 04:13:49,299
Really?

2737
04:13:49,299 --> 04:13:50,180
Are you serious?

2738
04:13:50,180 --> 04:13:51,700
9,085.

2739
04:13:52,420 --> 04:13:53,670
Jesus Christ.

2740
04:13:57,430 --> 04:13:59,350
Well, if you that's a lot of new people.

2741
04:13:59,350 --> 04:14:00,709
If you're new, we'll hopefully see you again.

2742
04:14:01,270 --> 04:14:04,709
We try to do fun stuff like this on like a monthly basis.

2743
04:14:04,709 --> 04:14:07,909
So top WWE streamer.

2744
04:14:13,360 --> 04:14:15,889
But I think I'm going to end it here.

2745
04:14:17,760 --> 04:14:18,959
I've got to go take care of Otto.

2746
04:14:19,760 --> 04:14:22,319
He ran downstairs and I got to go let him out and feed him and shit.

2747
04:14:22,319 --> 04:14:22,799
I got to go.

2748
04:14:28,239 --> 04:14:29,280
You guys are fucking incredible.

2749
04:14:29,280 --> 04:14:31,920
Thank you everybody for subscribing, for giving money.

2750
04:14:35,809 --> 04:14:36,610
Thank you so much.

2751
04:14:39,030 --> 04:14:40,629
And I'll see you next weekend.

2752
04:14:40,629 --> 04:14:41,430
There's even more.

2753
04:14:41,430 --> 04:14:42,549
We're not fucking stopping.

2754
04:14:42,549 --> 04:14:44,629
The brakes don't we don't fucking hit the brakes anymore.

2755
04:14:45,729 --> 04:14:50,370
Next weekend is the movie night for the green screen.

2756
04:14:51,270 --> 04:14:52,549
That's going to be a fucking ton of fun.

2757
04:14:54,309 --> 04:14:57,909
I've seen some of the shit you guys have made so far and it's hilarious.

2758
04:14:59,940 --> 04:15:01,139
So that's next weekend.

2759
04:15:01,139 --> 04:15:02,579
Every fucking weekend we're doing something new.

2760
04:15:05,319 --> 04:15:11,799
Again, if you don't know, in the discord there is a channel called movie night.

2761
04:15:11,799 --> 04:15:12,920
There's a pinned message.

2762
04:15:13,559 --> 04:15:15,319
The video has to be uploaded to YouTube.

2763
04:15:15,959 --> 04:15:17,559
You can't just put it on like Reddit or something.

2764
04:15:17,559 --> 04:15:19,799
It's got to be a YouTube video, going to go to YouTube playlist.

2765
04:15:20,680 --> 04:15:28,360
It has to be there by next Thursday, 29th, Thursday or Friday.

2766
04:15:29,989 --> 04:15:30,629
Join the discord.

2767
04:15:30,629 --> 04:15:31,510
A lot of great people there.

2768
04:15:34,280 --> 04:15:35,559
And that's where I'm going to end it.

2769
04:15:35,559 --> 04:15:38,200
So I have my stream.

2770
04:15:38,200 --> 04:15:39,079
Unfortunately, I'm sorry.

2771
04:15:39,079 --> 04:15:44,520
I can't do the subs tonight and I got to go take care of the dog.

2772
04:15:44,520 --> 04:15:50,319
So all your subscriptions, all the money you guys gave the stream is fucking incredibly appreciated.

2773
04:15:50,319 --> 04:15:51,920
I can't believe people paid money to this stream,

2774
04:15:52,639 --> 04:15:56,420
but that's why I want to do stuff that's fun or at least I try.

2775
04:15:57,799 --> 04:16:00,440
If I, if I'm having fun, I hope you guys are too.

2776
04:16:01,860 --> 04:16:02,260
Cheers.

2777
04:16:02,819 --> 04:16:03,459
Much love to you.

2778
04:16:03,459 --> 04:16:04,340
See you guys on Tuesday.

2779
04:16:06,020 --> 04:16:06,819
Take care of yourselves.

2780
04:16:07,620 --> 04:16:25,600
Ta-ta for now.
