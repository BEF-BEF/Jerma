00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:18,309
What is, what kind of intro is this? It sounds like a bunch of birds. Oh, it's like people playing like they're like

2
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:26,940
Why is it like a giant YouTube button in the middle like, oh play the video. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to

3
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:32,590
Football lol. That's not even what it's called. It's called football. This game is a game

4
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:36,670
Where you play football or soccer if you're an American. This is the part where you make duck noises.

5
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:39,429
I know this is this is the part where you make duck noises

6
00:00:39,429 --> 00:00:42,509
So you don't even have to do it now because you already said that's the part where you make duck noises

7
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:44,570
And it's already been done, right? So this game

8
00:00:48,189 --> 00:00:51,070
So if you take a look here

9
00:00:51,189 --> 00:00:53,189
this is the

10
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:57,909
Power-ups that you can do during this game and you're wondering what do you mean a power-up?

11
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:02,909
Well, each one of these things see this mine right here. I can we don't control any characters

12
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:10,049
Nobody controls any of the actual players you just control the weird power-ups and the stupid AI tries to score goals on each other

13
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:13,260
Okay, good luck. Good luck

14
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:20,400
You're just gonna get fans

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,920
Good game. What?

16
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:33,060
Win by five. I win. What did you do? I won. I was like spamming you guys with like ants

17
00:01:33,579 --> 00:01:37,989
Okay, I have the star. Yes, screw you

18
00:01:39,709 --> 00:01:43,480
You're not doing this. I'll do whatever it takes

19
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,079
You can't do it now

20
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,769
Oh

21
00:01:49,769 --> 00:01:52,670
Get off the field everybody get the field spam cows

22
00:01:53,769 --> 00:01:57,219
What's the score?

23
00:01:58,099 --> 00:02:00,099
Where's my it's down here?

24
00:02:00,219 --> 00:02:02,239
alright, where I

25
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:04,319
Can't believe one just went in right there. I

26
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:11,280
Did I win? No. No, you didn't what it's nine to seven. What's but we need to just win by five, right?

27
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:16,280
Yes, you need to win by five. I'm like running out of resources. Yeah, I need to build resources

28
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,240
Everyone get out of here send everybody the sidelines

29
00:02:30,099 --> 00:02:37,780
Okay, I'm back I think my game just like a hard crashed dude your net moving is that's not fair that's really good I

30
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,199
Click that got the window and it messed up the recording. Just keep doing that

31
00:02:42,919 --> 00:02:46,909
What is 13 my way? Who's winning? You're winning by two?

32
00:02:47,389 --> 00:02:51,599
All right

33
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:59,159
Keep doing that. Does it use points? I'm out of those points tie it up to a 1312 right now

34
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:04,759
I gotta win this you think you can stop the cows. I don't think I can do you think you can stop

35
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:06,759
I'm sitting on the wrong side. Oh

36
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:09,460
You see that kick

37
00:03:12,259 --> 00:03:15,340
13 13 this is gonna get real boring real soon

38
00:03:16,379 --> 00:03:18,379
You're probably out of cows

39
00:03:18,419 --> 00:03:21,280
You could just why can you just keep moving your net this is bullshit

40
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:25,610
Come on come on. Oh

41
00:03:27,189 --> 00:03:29,750
14 13. I'm out of resources, too

42
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:32,430
Now we just have to watch a soccer game. Oh

43
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:39,419
Danny DeVito is moving down mid lane. He's passing it to his teammate. He throws up a force field throws up another crown

44
00:03:39,939 --> 00:03:46,979
Would you get these crowns? I told you you could buy hats hats. You could buy hats. Oh, why are you okay?

45
00:03:47,659 --> 00:03:50,300
One of the very first things I explained this game has hats

46
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:55,379
I'm just gonna time-lapse the rest of this cuz we're just gonna sit here doing nothing. There's no more no more fun stuff

47
00:03:55,659 --> 00:04:04,300
Wow star wins

48
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:10,000
Yeah, I know. Thank you. Thank you very much

49
00:04:17,139 --> 00:04:19,459
No, no drop them drop them in the portals

50
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:22,470
I

51
00:04:26,269 --> 00:04:32,850
Don't know it's a really stupid plan. I'm going to lose I'm gonna lose. It's 16

52
00:04:36,819 --> 00:04:38,819
I only got the balls

53
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:45,339
What is going on over here? What is this? Why is it like a fountain of soccer balls you see?

54
00:04:45,339 --> 00:04:53,089
I don't I don't know why you did this. I don't know what decision you were making

55
00:04:54,170 --> 00:05:03,209
So yeah, you gotta sit here for two minutes while I'm up 36 to two are you okay with this I

56
00:05:04,089 --> 00:05:08,449
Was sitting here thinking of a real strategy. I just feel like an idiot now

57
00:05:13,329 --> 00:05:16,459
See I'm trying to win over here and you're just like

58
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:24,500
Have you met me before do it do you know who I am? Oh you want to do cannons you think oh you want to drop

59
00:05:24,579 --> 00:05:29,360
Firepower you want to drop some fucking firepower. Is that what you wanted to do?

60
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:40,639
Have I scored any points and my score to call

62
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,600

00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:13,430
No, who is it gonna come into I don't know yes, I don't know

67
00:06:24,459 --> 00:06:27,660
I don't know whose goal is whose I have no idea

68
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:33,279
I don't know it's like you know that game with the cups when you put the cups around like the thing and you move the

69
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:38,399
Cups around real fast. No, I don't know. I don't know who's is who I have I had a plan

70
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:40,959
I had a plan here both of our nets

71
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,319
Which the one on the bottom is yours one of the bottom is yours?

72
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:47,040
No, it's not is it is

73
00:06:54,459 --> 00:07:01,230
Why they're not shooting

74
00:07:05,589 --> 00:07:07,589
Why do they not shoot

75
00:07:11,329 --> 00:07:13,329
I dropped 36 of them

76
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:29,470
Shoot they don't shoot right away. I dropped like over 30 of them

77
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:33,480
Oh starting off really slow a couple of guys kick around a ball

78
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:43,079

00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:47,720
Sing on D. You might have to give them some help. We should probably give them a little bit of help here

80
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:05,550
Okay, I can't see what's going on and this is gonna throw up I have a hundred and seventy more of these
