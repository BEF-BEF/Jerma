00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:15,000
Hello, Perk. You guys asked for holo. There we go, now you should be able to hear me.

2
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:28,140
How you doing? If you're wondering about the mic change, it's because I'm using the index micro-

3
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:39,850
is it quiet? Let me turn it up. What is that? I wasn't wondering. Ow? What do you mean ow?

4
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:49,210
I just punched- oh shit, that's gonna happen, isn't it? All the time. I needed- all right, listen.

5
00:00:50,600 --> 00:01:09,189
I needed freedom in my space, okay? In that room is my office. It's too cramped in there. I had to

6
00:01:09,189 --> 00:01:19,030
upgrade my space, and that means bringing my entire computer setup, monitors, tower, keyboard,

7
00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:26,840
into my fucking living room. So I would have streamed like three days ago,

8
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:35,379
because it wasn't feeling well. I had diarrhea. Bad. But I brought my entire computer into my

9
00:01:35,379 --> 00:01:44,140
living room, so I couldn't do anything. So I just let it run its course. I think I'm okay today,

10
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:54,489
I hope so. We'll find out. You and I are going to find out very shortly if I've got to run away,

11
00:01:55,290 --> 00:02:04,069
which I hope doesn't happen. And by the way, this is- the mic's going to sound a little better.

12
00:02:04,069 --> 00:02:19,479
I'm holding- look, I'm just gonna go live, whatever. Okay, listen. Got an index. Oh my god!

13
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:26,090
Hey, look what I got for Christmas! I got an index! And I tripped over the wire and fucking

14
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:41,590
ate it. I have an index now, and I can't- how's my hair? Probably do. What do you mean? What?

15
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:50,629
No, it's because the mic- the webcam's like up on a thing. Like I have like a- I embedded it into

16
00:02:50,629 --> 00:03:03,300
the fucking wall. I'm gonna trip over this guy, I know it. We're gonna play Boneworks first. So,

17
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:14,889
yeah, you'll hear me better when the headset's on. It looks beautiful. I can see you guys in here.

18
00:03:14,889 --> 00:03:18,250
I'm just delaying it, because I hate getting into this fucking thing, because once I get in here,

19
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:22,969
I know that I'm gonna lose 400 or 500 hairs off the front of my head. That's why I don't like

20
00:03:22,969 --> 00:03:31,210
doing this. I'm just like- I'm just making sure you guys have an image of me with an extra 400

21
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:39,669
here. Right in the front. I'm probably cutting out what I want. Sure, that I have hairs on the top

22
00:03:39,669 --> 00:03:53,240
of my head, right? Is that what it sounds like? That's probably what it sounds like. Bobby? Also,

23
00:03:54,280 --> 00:04:00,939
what do I hope that this looks okay? Because what I've been told is the index has a higher

24
00:04:00,939 --> 00:04:07,419
field of view than all the other ones. By the way, pog. But it can make capturing it kind of

25
00:04:07,419 --> 00:04:15,539
a pain in the ass. So, I have three different capture modes on this thing. I feel like I'm

26
00:04:15,539 --> 00:04:22,019
working on a fucking sink with somebody. And they're down there. Yeah, so move two or three

27
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:28,839
inches to the right. The screws are right there. God, that was a pretty good joke. Am I going in?

28
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:39,079
I'm going in. I can see you guys in here. Let me get this on right. And I got that thing. Where am

29
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:52,949
I? My hands aren't on there. Hold on. There you are. What are you saying? What is your room like?

30
00:04:52,949 --> 00:05:03,139
What? I gotta get I got these I look at these things. Tiny hands. I don't have to what do I

31
00:05:03,139 --> 00:05:08,149
have big fucking hands. My hands are actually embarrassingly large. I hate it. I don't I don't

32
00:05:08,149 --> 00:05:18,009
why do I have to log in? All right. This. This just reminded me of I know this is a joke. But

33
00:05:18,009 --> 00:05:23,129
for a second, I was fucking furious. Because I thought this was like, like origin or something

34
00:05:23,129 --> 00:05:27,129
like you got to log into origin before you play the game. I was about to get really, really mad.

35
00:05:27,129 --> 00:05:36,149
That room makes me look tiny. It's a gigantic fucking living room. Yeah, you know who else looks

36
00:05:36,149 --> 00:05:42,300
small you when you take all the furniture out of your living room, all the couch, the chairs,

37
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:48,100
the TVs, everything, you move your entire desktop into the center of the room. You probably got

38
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:54,920
going to look six feet tall anymore. It's up. I swear your cameras blurry. Oh, shit, I actually

39
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,480
forgot. You're right. You're right. Good. Good. I'm going to stall as long as I want because

40
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:34,899
once I get in, you know, we're good for like, we want to change the camera. You guys can't even

41
00:06:34,899 --> 00:06:41,100
hear me. I've been talking shit for like a minute straight and nobody can hear me. I've just been

42
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:47,819
over there just just like talking shit. Nobody could hear it. Oh, what did I just say? It was

43
00:06:47,819 --> 00:06:54,279
such it was like a good I said it was a whatever. Oh, right. Auto focus. Why the fuck do people put

44
00:06:54,279 --> 00:07:00,519
auto focuses on a webcam doesn't move it in the same exact place you don't move you physically

45
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:31,980
don't move. Ready? Pretty good. Oh, shut up. I need to wear it. Otherwise, my doctor is going

46
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:43,930
to be mad that I did this today. All right, here we go. What does this say? Where's my center? There

47
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:52,629
we are. Hold on. Boneworks attention bonework subroutine operates on highly experimental

48
00:07:52,629 --> 00:07:56,550
simulated physics. My pants are going to come down at some point during the stream.

49
00:07:57,509 --> 00:08:08,279
It's nice and tight. Look at that. Oh, he's got an index. Oh, dude, he's got an index. What?

50
00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:27,189
You can't do that unless you have one. Okay, I think I'm ready. Expert VR users only.

51
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:41,000
Finally, the penis stream. Please identify your real world height. They think I'm five nine. See?

52
00:08:41,879 --> 00:08:46,519
Oh, look at how small you look in your room. I think it thinks I'm five nine. This is a

53
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:51,419
this is a big living room. That's not how tall we really are. So let's make it accurate.

54
00:08:54,860 --> 00:09:05,750
Expert mode. Average height. Am I on the camera from over here? Make sure I'm in the right spot.

55
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:15,610
Can you guys still see me? Yeah, that's fine. I'm gonna be that's a cute look. I can go like

56
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:19,129
I can fucking go like this today. You know what I mean? I couldn't do that in the other room.

57
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:28,039
I'm gonna be standing. Are you sure? I don't know why that just said attention. Try seated mode if

58
00:09:28,039 --> 00:09:35,190
you have a soul. Like wait, what do you mean? Like a soul? I'm soulless? I'm I'm not concerned

59
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:49,240
about my real world surroundings. I'm gonna be fine. Wait, what? Is your floor okay? Yeah,

60
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:59,289
yeah, that's fine. Soulless Andy. I think that looks all right. Administrator privileges granted.

61
00:09:59,289 --> 00:10:03,769
Confirm measurements to proceed. You want to know the best part about the index? I know you're gonna

62
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:07,529
hear that. Look, by the way, I need to make a really this is a real warning for the stream.

63
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:15,480
The real warning for the stream is I'm going to punch myself in the face probably twice.

64
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:22,409
I'm gonna say two or three times. I am using the the index mic. So I am really sorry if all

65
00:10:22,409 --> 00:10:26,490
of a sudden you hear like an explosion because I punched myself directly in the eyes. I'm just

66
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:42,009
saying it's possible. All looks fine. Yeah, save settings. Stress level zero. Boneworks.

67
00:10:44,679 --> 00:10:48,840
So that I need to be aware of that because I put that on the ground so I don't get like killed in

68
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:57,110
here. That's like where I'm safe. As long as I'm like in this area, as long as I'm in this zone here,

69
00:10:58,139 --> 00:11:12,980
I am safe. Okay, should I do anything? I'm not even capturing this. So who cares? This is loud

70
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:40,299
too. I gotta drop this. All right, that's better. Okay, new game story. Is this zipper down? Why

71
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:43,500
are we watching a movie? By the way, I haven't done this yet. I want to do this.

72
00:11:44,840 --> 00:12:10,059
I want to watch a movie in VR and pretend like I have like a 500 inch screen. Movie night. Oh,

73
00:12:10,059 --> 00:12:14,629
I can skip this. No, don't skip. By the way, this is the middle of my room. I'm not even like on

74
00:12:14,629 --> 00:12:25,029
camera. I might need to recalibrate that. Should I skip the movie? No, I'm not going to skip the

75
00:12:25,029 --> 00:12:42,120
movie. I don't know. Look, it's quiet. Why can't I do a peace sign? It doesn't look right. What's

76
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:59,690
wrong with my hands? They calibrate themselves. Object. Coffee cup. Indestructible.

77
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:16,519
Skip the shit out of me. I thought I was too far away. Coffee cup. Oh, that felt good. These

78
00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:30,039
are cool. These are cool. That's fun. I have barely played with this, by the way. All right,

79
00:13:30,039 --> 00:13:43,110
wait. Put it in the archive. Like I've barely done like this. Oh, it's weird though. I'm not.

80
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:53,740
Actually, do I pick things up like this? I think I do. Shit, it's kind of hard to get used to.

81
00:13:54,700 --> 00:14:06,519
What? No, pick it up. Stick my pinky out. This is freaking me out. Oh my God. This is so easy.

82
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:24,009
Oh my God. It's so easy. All right. Disposal. It's so weird to do this. Honest to God. I feel

83
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:30,970
like I'm stuck on this. I know it's like I just have to use my hands the way that they normally

84
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:56,700
are but still put it in the gammon. I got a better idea. All right. Let go. Oh, I was holding on to

85
00:14:56,700 --> 00:15:29,379
it. Skip the shit out of me. I didn't let it go. How do you jump? All right. I'm listening.

86
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:50,870
Because I didn't let it go. All right. Where do I go? Do it. There we go. How's the audio? We good?

87
00:15:54,419 --> 00:15:56,820
Before I get really started here, I want to make sure you guys can hear me and shit.

88
00:15:57,539 --> 00:16:07,769
We good? All right. Let's fucking go. Snap turn, crouch, locomotion. Oh, I don't need that. Look at

89
00:16:07,769 --> 00:16:16,100
this. You think I need a snap turn? You think I need a snap turn? Can't do this in the other

90
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:32,730
fucking room. It's fun. It's a brick. I'm keeping this and I'm going to smash this on somebody's

91
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:44,940
fucking head in like two minutes. Our minds are directly connected to the void. Bone works.

92
00:16:48,019 --> 00:16:54,759
There's some kind of diamond. Why am I holding this like a jeweler? If you die in real life,

93
00:16:54,759 --> 00:17:09,269
do you die in the void? Probably. We're gonna fucking imagine that that's your head. Okay.

94
00:17:09,269 --> 00:17:26,569
We're good. Pizza? What? Nobody throw. I can't throw with my left hand. Okay. You want to see?

95
00:17:27,369 --> 00:17:34,700
That's right hand. Perfect, right? Let's try left hand.

96
00:17:39,609 --> 00:17:43,769
How come we don't teach that in school? You know what I mean? Why don't we like teach people to be

97
00:17:43,769 --> 00:17:50,599
both left and right dominated? You know what I mean? We should teach that because everybody

98
00:17:50,599 --> 00:17:58,259
just uses the same hand for everything. Give me that. I want the fucking coffee cup.

99
00:17:58,819 --> 00:18:14,440
How would you get this in real life? Not bad. Let's go.

100
00:18:29,109 --> 00:18:41,099
Just wait. I'm fucking ready. Why am I crouching? Stand up. What's wrong with me? What's wrong with

101
00:18:41,099 --> 00:18:58,970
my character? Why am I stop crouching? There we go. What does it say? All right. What? Oh, I got a

102
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:10,390
gun? Okay. Uh, 10 PM. Willie Arthur Ford was seen eating lunch in the anomalous object disposal

103
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:16,150
break room. Well, I'll sit on a, he's on a break, check his time, whatever. Like I probably could,

104
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:28,420
should I take this? I probably need this. Can I use this computer? No, I want, I could have fly

105
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:56,759
paper all over me. Let's go. How do I walk? I can't walk. Fix your webcam. What's wrong with it?

106
00:19:56,759 --> 00:20:14,710
What's wrong with it? Yeah, I'll move it up. I'll just give me a minute. Okay. Key card, right?

107
00:20:15,269 --> 00:20:37,079
Where's the key card go? Security director. All right. Key card. Oh, don't do that. Got these,

108
00:20:38,039 --> 00:20:48,500
these fucking hotel keys. We got bags here. Honey, go, um, go to the front desk and find out what the

109
00:20:48,500 --> 00:21:01,609
fuck is going on. Stupid fucking hotel key. What was that? Out of frame. All right. Let me fix it

110
00:21:01,609 --> 00:21:04,329
right now. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Let me get, let me do it. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait.

111
00:21:04,329 --> 00:21:23,299
All right. I'm just going to turn it this way a little bit. Is that better? That's probably better,

112
00:21:23,299 --> 00:21:41,109
right? How's that? That's probably good. Game audio is low. It doesn't, it looks like it's pretty

113
00:21:41,109 --> 00:21:54,200
high. All right. Let's go. This looks good. I have a normal house. I almost just fucking pulled the

114
00:21:54,200 --> 00:22:08,390
whole, the whole tower down. Did I? No. Holy shit. That was terrifying. All right. Let's go. If I

115
00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:12,539
need to move it a little more, I will. I think it's in a good spot though. All right. You don't

116
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:17,420
have any idea. I'm so excited to play with these and I heard that this was the thing to play.

117
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:22,539
I'm going to milk it. You know what I mean? I'm going to milk the fuck out of this.

118
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:29,319
Oh, I didn't tell you my favorite part about the Vive. It's not the Vive. Fucking sorry about that.

119
00:22:29,319 --> 00:22:35,400
It's an index. So my absolute favorite part about this whole thing is these headphones.

120
00:22:36,039 --> 00:22:42,359
Holy shit. They're open ear headphones. I can have these on. I can hear everything around me. I can

121
00:22:42,359 --> 00:22:47,079
see everything around me. It's unbelievable. It's the best feature of the entire Vive by far.

122
00:22:48,200 --> 00:23:01,079
Holy shit. It's unbelievable. Mega milk. All right. I feel like I'm going to need this

123
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:06,940
and I'm going to need to go to Rick. Where am I? Okay. Look, here's another thing. I'm scared to

124
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:12,700
be in a big open space because I feel like it's more dangerous for me to be in a huge open space

125
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:19,660
because I'm not scared to go like this. But I lost the key card. But I feel like that's even

126
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:23,500
worse because I'm going to run through my wall like a Looney Tunes cartoon. You understand?

127
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:33,559
You're nude. What are you talking about? My pants down? I'm wearing an abdomen chest brace

128
00:23:33,559 --> 00:23:42,809
thing. So it's probably what you see. I'm still out of frame. It's not perfect. I have a big room

129
00:23:42,809 --> 00:23:54,420
here. Okay. Snap right turn. Yeah, I know. Oh my God. Yep. No, I want this. Oh, you got to be

130
00:23:54,420 --> 00:24:15,420
fucking kidding me, bro. I want to keep this. I'm going to start a fight.

131
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:40,740
Game with us. Monogon. What happened? What? Oh, I think I was supposed to turn that off.

132
00:24:42,569 --> 00:25:09,529
Oops. Don't do it. It's over the face. Oh my God. Is there a baseball mini game?

133
00:25:10,569 --> 00:25:14,569
Is there a baseball mini game? I'm asking you a question. Is there a baseball mini game?

134
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:39,720
No. Oh well. These aren't buttons. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait. No, don't open. Don't open. Don't

135
00:25:39,720 --> 00:26:00,150
open. No, don't open. I have to do like a Bloodborne or Dark Souls thing. Oh, that was wicked funny.

136
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:34,470
This is so fun to throw stuff. Is it going in? Oh, what's with this fucking immersion?

137
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:48,089
Nice. I have a cool immersion. Is this supposed to be happening? Critic Andy.

138
00:26:50,119 --> 00:27:08,339
I think we don't have full body tracking. Check my zipper. I don't have a zipper. These are

139
00:27:08,339 --> 00:27:20,410
fucking like workout pants. I think my pants have been down. Holy shit. What? No, they're not.

140
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:39,779
Can you guys see me? No. Yeah, my pants are like coming down. Whatever. Fuck it. It feels like

141
00:27:39,779 --> 00:27:49,059
I'm wearing a diaper. Yeah, there's like my underwear down. I think my underwear is like here.

142
00:27:49,779 --> 00:27:57,559
How is that possible? Oh damn, my VR too much. My underwear came down, but my pants didn't.

143
00:27:57,559 --> 00:28:16,579
That doesn't make no sense. Opening day. Stop that. Let that gut breathe. No, I can't.

144
00:28:17,539 --> 00:28:20,420
Do you guys probably think I'm wearing this because I'm trying to hide

145
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:27,700
like my Attack on Titan, Titan stomach. I'm not. I'm wearing it to support my fucking chest bones.

146
00:28:28,339 --> 00:28:53,029
Prepare for the future. Okay. Am I still in the tutorial? Menu, grab, snap, turn. I already did

147
00:28:53,029 --> 00:29:18,230
this. Oh, there's a jump. Okay. There we go. Touch. Honey, can you see it yet? Can you see the porn

148
00:29:18,309 --> 00:29:45,960
channel yet? God damn it. I'm trying. It's still all blurry. Okay. Yeah, that's a turn. I get it.

149
00:29:45,960 --> 00:30:14,089
Hold on. How do I run? Oh, okay. Just hold it. This is Minecraft. So like in 500 years, are we

150
00:30:14,089 --> 00:30:20,009
going to be, are the aliens going to think that we were Minecraft characters? People play too much.

151
00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:27,210
It's Roblox. Like that's what, that's what the aliens are going to think humans are.

152
00:30:27,769 --> 00:30:33,500
Because we're just, we're just going to be playing Minecraft forever. No, it's not.

153
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:41,109
Which is, I mean, the game's fucking phenomenal. So I could understand.

154
00:30:50,440 --> 00:31:00,069
Like a museum. And there's a guy just like, why? I don't even need to see this shit.

155
00:31:02,089 --> 00:31:09,259
It's double stick to run. Oh, that's helpful. Thank you. All right. Let's ruin the experience

156
00:31:09,259 --> 00:31:28,329
for everybody here and just play both at the same time. Cool. What about this one? Whatever.

157
00:31:30,089 --> 00:31:36,890
That was cool. Museum. That was fun. All right. Now what? Here comes the gift shop.

158
00:31:36,890 --> 00:31:49,019
App for a quick hop. That guy's 800 rounds. Jump while crouching for a huge leap.

159
00:31:51,339 --> 00:32:10,890
Okay. So it's Luigi from Mario 2. Got it. That's fine. Wait, crouch. Oh, did I make it? I did it.

160
00:32:10,890 --> 00:32:26,839
All right. We're good. All right. That was fun. terrain can be crossed by running and jumping.

161
00:32:27,559 --> 00:32:34,200
Why does everybody do that in every TV show and movie? Whenever there's a big jump, the

162
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:41,319
character always does that. They go like this. That doesn't do anything. Get into a fucking ball.

163
00:32:41,319 --> 00:32:46,500
I told you it was going to happen. I'm sorry. But get in tight jump and then get tight like

164
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:59,769
a fucking goddamn cannonball. You'll move. Yeah. All right. Yeah. I just impressed the fuck out of

165
00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:16,619
like half of you. Half of you. Climbing. Oh, wait, can I? Ow. That hurts so bad.

166
00:33:16,619 --> 00:33:33,670
Let go. I'm not even holding it. All right. To save additional items, place them in the platform.

167
00:33:33,670 --> 00:33:40,579
All right. Let's go like this. I thought that was my face. I was like, why does it have that?

168
00:33:40,579 --> 00:33:46,500
Because look at the background. It looks like a webcam room. I was like, I don't have a goatee.

169
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:52,759
I was like, where's that from? All right. Yeah. Save manually if you want to. Let's go.

170
00:33:53,559 --> 00:34:00,809
I have this sweat coming down my ass. I think I have to take off this brace. It's like making

171
00:34:00,809 --> 00:34:30,840
me fucking sweat. They're making like, whoa. It's like going to the McDonald's play place

172
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:36,219
and thinking you're like the man for being able to do that. Sorry. I'm facing the right way now.

173
00:34:36,219 --> 00:35:26,650
What the fuck? Get out of the way. Oh, this is brick. You know it. Come on. Oh, heavy. Oh,

174
00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:39,130
this is heavy. Very cool. So much can break. So much it can break. Interactable handles

175
00:35:39,130 --> 00:35:44,489
and grab points can be found in the environment. Sure. Okay. Don't be too aggressive. Oh,

176
00:35:49,500 --> 00:36:04,820
holy shit. Ooh. It's like all the kids at the fucking playground. They all have like the ball

177
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:12,099
and they're like, pull it harder. Harder. And finally an adult looks over and is like, no,

178
00:36:12,099 --> 00:36:16,019
no, no, no, no. And one of the kids gets it right in the fucking face and flies.

179
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:41,719
There's a wall. Didn't hit it. I don't care. Only hero objects can be grabbed from a distance. Okay.

180
00:36:49,829 --> 00:37:18,059
God damn it. They need to be thinner. That's fun just to do that. Move heavy objects slowly.

181
00:37:22,659 --> 00:37:26,420
All right. I don't know why. Did anybody just feel like what I was just doing right there was

182
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:31,219
one of those like zombie iPad game ads where it's like all of a sudden that person's like,

183
00:37:31,219 --> 00:37:35,139
oh yeah, cooking a burger. And then it's like, ah, they start running wicked fast and fucking

184
00:37:35,139 --> 00:37:49,510
zombies start attacking. That's how I just felt like it was happening. Dude, I get so many ads

185
00:37:49,510 --> 00:38:15,639
on Twitter. These are, that's hard to do. Watch that form, bro. Okay. This is just like a little

186
00:38:15,639 --> 00:38:22,010
playground in this game. Well, I'm not going to spoil anything. Where am I going? I'm over here.

187
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:30,139
This is double deer. This thing's like squeeze. This thing has a tongue and it squeezes out people.

188
00:38:30,139 --> 00:38:55,130
Oh my God. I'm going to Indiana Jones myself. Should I jump up there? Where am I? Should I

189
00:38:55,130 --> 00:39:13,300
jump up here? Oh, I got it. All right. I did it. Get on top of this. What the fuck?

190
00:39:18,010 --> 00:39:37,460
Whatever. Crouch that this thing's gotta come off. Even if like my like chest muscles hurt and my

191
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:56,340
like back hurts. This thing I'm wearing like a sweat belt. It's coming off. Press it. Oh,

192
00:39:56,340 --> 00:40:18,730
companion cube. I know. All right. Hold on. Where are you? Hold on a sec. I'm taking this thing off.

193
00:40:18,809 --> 00:40:28,170
It sounds like I'm wearing a diaper. Hold on to guys. I just got to change my diaper really quick.

194
00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:44,150
Okay. That's better. That thing is just too much. Oh, how are we doing? Okay. I need to do this.

195
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:52,340
That thing is the best. This is OVR advanced settings. It's that thing tells you how many

196
00:40:52,340 --> 00:41:01,820
times you've spun around. Awesome. Okay. Exhibit under construction. Let's go. I feel like this is

197
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:08,260
a TF2 map, right? Don't you just feel like you're going to see like soldiers just like one, two,

198
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:29,429
three, four, five, six, seven, eight, and get to the top by breaking the glass. I can do that in

199
00:41:29,429 --> 00:42:02,760
this room. I can do that in here. What? Why can't I break that? Oops. Back it up. I can't even. I

200
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:33,059
can't touch it. Whatever. Break the barrels. Turn it around like this. There we go. Try breaking

201
00:42:33,059 --> 00:43:12,179
the planks. Oh, it's fun. I don't want to do puzzles. Oh, TV. What's on the TV? Let's find out.

202
00:43:12,179 --> 00:44:05,110
Wait, is this cheating? What am I? What do I have to do? Do it right? Look at me. Look at me.

203
00:44:05,269 --> 00:44:34,019
Okay. Now get me over here. Why can't I get up here? Okay. What? What? What's wrong with me?

204
00:44:34,739 --> 00:44:48,619
Why did I do that? Why did I get sucked backwards? Somebody just grabbed me by the back of the head

205
00:44:48,619 --> 00:45:24,260
and just pulled me up here. Get. Go. What's wrong? You're five foot three. What? Where'd I go?

206
00:45:25,719 --> 00:45:37,460
Okay. Hold on. Trouble jumping? No, I'm not having trouble jumping. I'm fine. What happened?

207
00:45:37,460 --> 00:45:45,239
Emergency elevator lock. What? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

208
00:45:45,239 --> 00:46:10,300
Wait, don't go without me. Oh, what's wrong with me? Emergency elevator override. You failed the

209
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:20,889
tutorial. Did you say I need to pull this out? You know what? I could do without like the fucking

210
00:46:20,969 --> 00:46:41,260
porn music in my ears. Can I just skip this shit? Okay. So I have to go. I, yeah, yeah, yeah. Let's

211
00:46:41,260 --> 00:47:04,679
go. There we go. All right. Move. All right. What's wrong with this shit? Why is it so difficult for

212
00:47:04,679 --> 00:47:28,500
me to do this part? I'm not supposed to be doing it like this. I'm doing this part wrong. What?

213
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:58,389
What is this for? Okay. All right. Let's not fuck this part up now. Let's go. Now that's going to

214
00:47:58,389 --> 00:48:21,480
stay, right? Get off it. What's the point of this? Emergency elevator override. Puzzle master. Go

215
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:30,860
back up. This is a puzzle game. Please don't tell me this is a puzzle game. How do I go back up?

216
00:48:32,579 --> 00:48:49,059
I can't. It is. There are a lot of, not this way. Get the fuck off me. Can I delete the soundtrack?

217
00:48:49,059 --> 00:49:05,670
Like how do I just remove the soundtrack from the game? Yep. Okay. Okay. Okay.

218
00:49:06,469 --> 00:49:26,730
I gotta go back up there and then jump over that shit. I don't know. Shut off the TV. Okay.

219
00:49:28,869 --> 00:49:41,349
Whoa. All right. Get me the fuck out of here. What's this portal bullshit? Welcome to floor two.

220
00:49:45,190 --> 00:50:00,119
I keep thinking that's me. Hold on. We're good. All right. Let's see. That makes me dizzy though.

221
00:50:00,119 --> 00:50:17,480
I gotta be careful. All right. Where's the fucking Macy's? Here. Skechers is here. You may find these

222
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:22,119
exhibits more complex and somewhat challenging. Please take all the time you need in order to

223
00:50:22,119 --> 00:50:26,280
fully grasp these mechanics. We recommend taking a short break then return to these concepts.

224
00:50:27,739 --> 00:51:05,699
Oh god. Is this gonna fling me? Oh. Can I weigh this down? Drinking of water. Where is it? And I

225
00:51:05,699 --> 00:51:22,780
will have some coffee too. Let me get some coffee. Okay. All right. We're good. Out of breath?

226
00:51:23,739 --> 00:51:36,659
I'm not having... All right. This music though has gotta go. Menu operation. Pressing menu

227
00:51:36,659 --> 00:51:47,480
button again. Hold the menu button and point cursor. All right. What's the... Okay. References.

228
00:51:52,179 --> 00:52:05,530
References. What the fuck? I'm not listening to that for like another few hours. I'm just not

229
00:52:05,530 --> 00:52:18,280
going to. Does that change? Like I could tolerate it like here. The music changes. All right. Well,

230
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:35,510
how about like a six? What's this? Okay. That's a menu. Got it. Let's go. Body slots?

231
00:52:41,429 --> 00:52:46,230
Large items can be stored in the back. You just grab it, let go.

232
00:52:46,949 --> 00:52:55,349
So you can reach back and pick them up. They were very concerned that you weren't going to

233
00:52:55,349 --> 00:53:01,079
know how to like jump and hold items in this game. It seems in the beginning here. Gun mags have a

234
00:53:01,079 --> 00:53:11,610
pouch on your hip. Yeah. That's this thing here. Okay. Well, give it to me. Okay. Because you don't.

235
00:53:12,250 --> 00:53:35,670
Oh yeah. I know how to do this. All right. How do I let the clip go? Not like that. Is it storing

236
00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:49,369
it? All right. That's storing that. That's not how you do it. How do I do it? There we go. Okay.

237
00:53:49,369 --> 00:53:59,059
Cool. I can sit with the gun. I have an inventory. Yep. I go like this. Inventory. And then I can

238
00:53:59,059 --> 00:54:16,170
grab shit. Manage slots. I want this on this side here. What's the... What? Figure discipline.

239
00:54:16,809 --> 00:54:51,349
How did I drop the... How am I dropping this? Lower? I have to go this way. All right. I'm ready.

240
00:54:51,349 --> 00:55:23,579
I'm ready for bone works. Fuck. What the fuck, man? Okay. What's this? Throw these objects

241
00:55:24,219 --> 00:55:38,900
into reclamation bins to unlock them in sandbox scenes. Oh, cool. What's this? I already have

242
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:58,469
one of these. Search these bone boxes. They contain reclaimables and throw the reclaimables

243
00:55:58,469 --> 00:56:11,510
in the reclaim station. Oh, come on. Purchasing items? Exchange bullet tokens to purchase items.

244
00:56:12,150 --> 00:56:29,260
Those ammo? What? Okay. Preserve acquired items for later use using a reclaim bin. All right. So

245
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:48,659
what do I want? Okay. So let's go here. Inventory. Where am I? Where was my bin? Okay. Give me that.

246
00:56:49,139 --> 00:57:03,750
They're all the same thing, right? Cool. All right. Give me a refund. Cool. All right. Oh,

247
00:57:03,750 --> 00:57:25,610
shit. I already have one of those though, don't I? Did I just waste money? Okay. Did I waste money?

248
00:57:34,260 --> 00:57:56,309
Stop. Just get it in. Okay. Okay. Can I... Let's go. Are we ready? Items cannot travel between

249
00:57:56,309 --> 00:58:13,980
instances but projectile math can. What? Projectile math? Keep weapon pointed in a safe direction.

250
00:58:13,980 --> 00:58:17,019
Keep your finger off the trigger until you're ready to shoot. Keep weapon unloaded in an

251
00:58:17,019 --> 00:58:59,190
equip slot until you're ready to use it. Okay. Are these made out of cement? That's like a 98%

252
00:58:59,190 --> 00:59:21,800
accuracy. Oh, that would have been sick. What's this one? Why am I crouching? Stop crouching.

253
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:38,119
Get up. Fun. All right. What else is there? Oh, wow. What is this one? Where does it go?

254
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:54,230
Where does it go? Okay. What? Is it ready? Hey, how do I turn it on?

255
00:59:54,869 --> 01:00:39,019
There we go. Cool. What is it doing? It's hard. The index controllers are like really hard to get

256
01:00:39,019 --> 01:00:49,480
used to. That thing was automatically firing because I have to physically actually hold this

257
01:00:50,840 --> 01:01:16,380
with like all my hands. All right. Inventory slots. Cool. What's this one? Let's see what I'm

258
01:01:16,380 --> 01:01:34,809
talking about. Uh-huh. Fire. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's because I'm gripping like...

259
01:01:34,809 --> 01:01:41,050
Where are you? Because I'm gripping like this, right? You're supposed to do this when you hold

260
01:01:41,050 --> 01:02:23,880
a gun because this... Yeah. It's tricky. Don't turn around. Cool. You can't gun. Be careful.

261
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:31,079
You're wasting ammo. This is just like a how to shoot the gun tutorial. Impact physics. Oh, yes.

262
01:02:31,079 --> 01:03:14,139
Okay. I've been waiting for this all fucking day. Damn it. Fuck. Oh, this is knives?

263
01:03:15,460 --> 01:03:22,789
Holy shit. Come on. I got to do it like in the movies. No. Who's that guy? The League of Legends

264
01:03:22,789 --> 01:04:15,960
character? A twist of fate, right? The guy that throws whatever he is. Oh, yeah. I'm ready. I

265
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:41,739
literally made a fucking mess. Let's go. Hold on. Wait. Break the... I got to break the barrels?

266
01:04:52,309 --> 01:05:28,170
Oh, shit. Cool. How do I do this? I see. Okay. It's got to go in that one spot.

267
01:05:31,780 --> 01:05:56,420
Should I take a gun? All right. Let's go. I took more than one gun.

268
01:05:57,059 --> 01:06:08,389
Where the... Oh, I threw the handguns. Fuck. I don't even know where this come from.

269
01:06:09,210 --> 01:06:29,940
I don't fucking even need it. Let's go. All right. This is not the place to be on the shooting range.

270
01:06:32,780 --> 01:06:40,250
Hold on. It's like... Okay. You ever go to the driving range? Like the driving range, right?

271
01:06:40,250 --> 01:06:46,409
With the club. You're hitting golf balls. And like you hit like a little dribbler and it goes

272
01:06:47,849 --> 01:06:54,409
10 feet in front of you. Don't go get that ball. Do not go get that ball. Don't do it. You see

273
01:06:54,409 --> 01:07:00,420
people do that shit. They're like, oh, whoops. And they walk out there like five feet. You're

274
01:07:00,420 --> 01:07:05,780
going to get a ball sliced into your head. Just don't fucking do that. Handsless psycho. What?

275
01:07:06,500 --> 01:07:38,519
Three handguns. What the fuck? Dude, this is kind of hard to do. Am I doing this like wrong?

276
01:07:42,260 --> 01:07:53,019
It's like I can't reach that far into my body. It's because you're crouched?

277
01:07:57,780 --> 01:08:12,840
Even still, this feels weird to do. Like you need pants. You are crouched. I'm not crouched.

278
01:08:13,559 --> 01:08:36,060
Like you have... Look at how like weirdly I have to look down at that. I don't... I don't need 500

279
01:08:36,060 --> 01:08:59,210
bullets I'm leaving. Like this is... Okay. Let's go. I don't care. You don't need to put... Oh,

280
01:08:59,210 --> 01:09:19,000
wait. What did that person say? No, we're good. You don't need to put the bullets in your pouch?

281
01:09:19,960 --> 01:09:37,369
Attention. The exhibits in the following chamber represent complex concepts.

282
01:09:37,369 --> 01:09:47,510
You may exit through the gift shop if you desire to bypass these advanced chambers.

283
01:09:47,510 --> 01:10:12,680
I'll be using that. I got the key. Where is the gift shop over there? I'm going out through the

284
01:10:12,680 --> 01:10:16,680
gift shop if this is too hard. I don't even care if everyone... I don't care how embarrassing that is.

285
01:10:16,680 --> 01:11:06,539
Time control? Whoa. Hey, what the hell? Where do I go? Trash handlers. Oh, I can move around

286
01:11:06,539 --> 01:11:44,520
with this. This is so hard. Hold on. I need to... Am I going to knock that down? I'm going to knock

287
01:11:44,520 --> 01:12:17,859
this down. Am I holding this backwards? What the fuck? What the box? Do I have to like get

288
01:12:17,859 --> 01:12:24,020
them to come over here for something, right? Did it... Oh, the box and the... Wait, I did it?

289
01:12:27,640 --> 01:12:46,630
Oh, I did it. How do I put this away? How do I put this away? Get rid of one of the pistols.

290
01:12:47,270 --> 01:13:07,029
All right. I got it. Nice. That was fucking easy. I'm like a rat in a maze. It's a collectible. All

291
01:13:07,029 --> 01:13:17,220
right. Gravity room. Negative gravity fields provide temporary inverse mass calculation for

292
01:13:17,220 --> 01:13:23,159
improbable... I know what this music reminds me of. Okay. If you were to right now go to the

293
01:13:23,159 --> 01:13:29,479
app store, the Apple app store, and you were to type in like marble adventure game. This is

294
01:13:29,479 --> 01:13:36,439
every song that plays on like a marble get through the obstacle course iPad iPhone game.

295
01:13:37,560 --> 01:13:49,739
That's what it is. Mass... Okay. Gravity. Anti-gravity. Anti-mass physics are extremely

296
01:13:49,739 --> 01:13:58,039
experimental. Please enjoy this exhibit at your own risk. I got my gravity gun. So now what?

297
01:13:58,039 --> 01:14:12,359
Balloons deliver capable upward force. What? Oh, I'm making balloons. Do I have to like...

298
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:29,060
What just happened? What happened to my... Hold on. What just happened? Oh my god. I'm so sweaty.

299
01:14:31,479 --> 01:14:46,390
You farted? No, no, no. Hold on. Did you hear that? Give me one second. It sounded like my VR thing

300
01:14:46,390 --> 01:15:02,020
fucked up. Let me see. You guys can still see, right? Okay. That was weird. Let me just drink

301
01:15:02,020 --> 01:15:08,600
some water and coffee. I'm... Okay. I'm forever in balance. I'm drinking a shitload of coffee

302
01:15:08,600 --> 01:15:14,279
and a shitload of water. So like the diuretic that the coffee is, is being outweighed by the water.

303
01:15:15,159 --> 01:15:29,659
All right. I'm going back in. Can you guys even hear what I'm saying? Probably not.

304
01:15:30,300 --> 01:15:43,689
Where are your eyebrows? They're being squished. Where are your eyebrows? Oh, my hair.

305
01:15:47,380 --> 01:16:08,729
Back in the bone work. Oh my god. This is probably so loud. I'm sorry. I just lost audio in my left

306
01:16:08,729 --> 01:16:20,500
ear. That was weird. What's going on there? Okay. Audio is like leaving my left side of my head.

307
01:16:21,300 --> 01:16:39,140
Spin. All right. So I have a balloon gun. Where is it? Right here. Did I just do it to myself?

308
01:16:39,140 --> 01:17:32,659
Dude, is it going to work? Come on. Why is this not working? Come on. It's in every cartoon. Yeah.

309
01:17:32,659 --> 01:17:45,210
My headset's fucked up. Oh shit. This is like actually like broken. My... This cord is...

310
01:17:46,170 --> 01:17:56,140
Where does this go? Because my... I keep losing audio in my left ear when this cord is like

311
01:17:56,140 --> 01:18:32,979
moved at all. What? Cord loose? That's what I was hearing. Oh, it's fucked up. Yeah. I'm losing

312
01:18:32,979 --> 01:18:57,880
audio in my left ear. Whatever. It doesn't happen all the time. It sucks though. Index.

313
01:18:59,930 --> 01:19:18,970
Broken out of the box. I think that's better. Okay. Sounds like it's a... No. It's still happening.

314
01:19:20,579 --> 01:19:25,859
Fuck. I don't have audio in my left ear. Because when I tighten this is when it goes away.

315
01:19:26,500 --> 01:19:39,899
Oh, that's monumentally fucking disappointing. That's really disappointing. Oh well. All right.

316
01:19:39,899 --> 01:20:03,590
Let's go. Check the connections at the tower. No. This is all plugged in good. Yeah. This is all

317
01:20:03,590 --> 01:20:15,180
good to go. Because when I... If I put pressure on the cord up on my head, it cuts out in and out.

318
01:20:18,520 --> 01:20:30,119
Went to... What are you saying? Hold on. Went to SteamVR beta instead. Updated to beta headset

319
01:20:30,119 --> 01:20:47,739
firmware. Verify integrity. File of left speaker now works. Oh shit. Really? Huh. That's a lot of

320
01:20:47,739 --> 01:20:54,100
messages. All right. Whatever. It doesn't happen that often. It's not a software fix if I can wiggle

321
01:20:54,100 --> 01:21:02,520
the cord. That's really fucking annoying. This shit's like a thousand bucks. Like, come on.

322
01:21:04,840 --> 01:21:11,449
I mean, I did like punch it a little. I like hit my face a little bit. Did I break it by like

323
01:21:11,449 --> 01:21:18,789
hitting my head? Like kind of a little bit? That's disappointing. But whatever. It's playable.

324
01:21:19,270 --> 01:21:34,680
Just disappointing. Sorry about that. All right. Let's go. It's playable. It's just annoying.

325
01:21:35,319 --> 01:21:49,430
All right. So this is... Let me go like this. Oh, I gotta pull my pants up. No gravity. Do I have to

326
01:21:49,430 --> 01:22:06,680
make this thing move? How do I get these off my body? Can I get these off my arm? How do I get

327
01:22:06,680 --> 01:22:29,779
these off? Cut them off? Shoot them? I have to shoot them? Where's my stuff? Shoot more balloons

328
01:22:29,779 --> 01:22:56,460
and they'll go away. Oh, pretty sick. Oh shit. Gotta go. No, but I don't want these on my arm.

329
01:23:00,939 --> 01:23:07,420
God damn it. How do I get rid of these? All right. I got a plan. Wait. No, I don't. Fuck it. Let's

330
01:23:07,420 --> 01:23:44,390
go. Oh shit. I'm fucking... Are the balloons keeping me up? Go die. Give me a... God damn it.

331
01:23:44,390 --> 01:23:55,560
What do I do? I can't... They're attached. How do I get out of here?

332
01:23:58,619 --> 01:24:36,579
Why is this happening? Let me go. Softlock. Did I softlock the game? No. All right. How do I reset?

333
01:24:36,579 --> 01:25:01,000
How do I reset it? Burp Charlie. Eject? Punch them? Shoot them? I don't have a gun. Get off of me.

334
01:25:06,340 --> 01:25:20,180
Put more balloons? I can't. The gun's down there. Throw ammo at them. No, come back here.

335
01:25:21,060 --> 01:26:03,689
Oh, it works. It works. It works. That person's a genius. Okay. Get me up here. Go. Come here.

336
01:26:09,510 --> 01:26:25,590
Break it. What's this one fucking made out of? Come here. Wait. Wait. This is less. Go, go, go,

337
01:26:25,590 --> 01:26:44,569
go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. Why do I... Okay. I'm good. Why are the balloons still there?

338
01:26:44,569 --> 01:27:01,659
Shouldn't they be deleted? All right. Here's the gift shop. That's creepy. What does this one do?

339
01:27:02,300 --> 01:27:39,750
I don't like that. Get it off. Crystals? Can I steal this stuff? I'm just going to walk out with

340
01:27:39,750 --> 01:28:12,729
it. What are they going to do? Wait. I want to drink. Never mind. Never mind. Pick up that can.

341
01:28:12,729 --> 01:28:37,029
I don't want this. Never mind. Recycle. Garbage and recycling chamber. This is fun.

342
01:28:51,189 --> 01:29:47,659
I'm done. Were I supposed to do that? Tutorial complete. Okay. I'm in the trash.

343
01:29:54,039 --> 01:30:02,659
Better. All right. Let me get this situated. Better. Can't grab anything.

344
01:30:02,659 --> 01:31:03,159
Feels like a person. Come here. Big city. Did I go that way? Okay. It was an audio again.

345
01:31:08,489 --> 01:31:15,979
You know what I think it is? I think it's like the top of the cord is like something happened to it.

346
01:31:15,979 --> 01:31:39,739
Like in here. Like wherever the cord sits. Oh my God. Oops. Sorry. Are you guys here in the

347
01:31:39,739 --> 01:32:02,569
audio cutout or is it just me that hears it? Oh box. Okay. Wait. I break with this. There's

348
01:32:02,569 --> 01:32:37,340
nothing in here. Tether ball. Cool. Now what? Tether balls are the best. Yeah. I remember just

349
01:32:37,340 --> 01:32:43,609
sitting next to the tether ball. Everybody did this shit. You would go be going around slowly

350
01:32:43,609 --> 01:32:48,489
and you would just be like queuing up a fucking haymaker and you were just going to like crowhop

351
01:32:48,489 --> 01:32:54,890
like three times and punch it as hard as you could. You know those things need to come back.

352
01:32:54,890 --> 01:33:06,340
They were fun. Jerma seems not very enthralled by this game. Not really. I think it has to do

353
01:33:06,340 --> 01:33:22,729
too with the fact that I sometimes don't hear out of my left ear. Keep out. Oh, a brick. Two bricks.

354
01:33:22,729 --> 01:33:59,020
Get it off. I can't pull this off. Why not? I can't get it off. Why is the guy alive?

355
01:34:01,220 --> 01:34:39,380
Come on. Let me skyrim this guy. All right. Wait, wait, wait. Die. All right. Well, he's dead.

356
01:34:48,550 --> 01:35:19,130
Ball. Give me this. Can I? Wait. Hold the other way. Get off there. This way. Can I go that way?

357
01:35:27,189 --> 01:35:47,720
All right. We got it. That guy attacked us. District six. I can't break that with a hammer.

358
01:35:47,720 --> 01:36:00,869
I have to put a brick. Now, of course, I've got to shoot the basketball. Not even close.

359
01:36:02,310 --> 01:36:26,409
Oh, free stuff. All right. Where are we now? Broadwatchers skip. Um, you get VR streamers

360
01:36:26,409 --> 01:36:44,460
skip might be actually what we do here. We've got 35 games. Skip it. I'm going to give it a little

361
01:36:44,460 --> 01:36:51,859
bit more time. I feel like we just kind of got into it. I'm not into it though. It's not doing

362
01:36:51,859 --> 01:37:10,460
it for me. It just isn't. All right. So they okay. Let me start attacking them. Let me try to like

363
01:37:10,460 --> 01:37:42,710
just actually fight them. Never punched before. I don't I think I just have to keep going and jump

364
01:37:42,710 --> 01:37:59,770
over this. Get the hammer. I thought that was a gun. What is this for? Why can I pick up this

365
01:37:59,770 --> 01:38:14,039
fucking satellite? Okay. Who is howling? Smash him with the satellite. All right. Let me see if I

366
01:38:14,039 --> 01:38:22,140
can hit him in the head with the satellite. All right. Come over here. Come here. Come here. Come

367
01:38:22,140 --> 01:38:47,899
here. You come here. Can you not jump over here? Get the fuck. Why is this slow? Wait, what? Did I

368
01:38:47,899 --> 01:39:12,460
die? I'm just going to keep going. All right. I need, I need a general consensus from the people

369
01:39:12,460 --> 01:39:20,010
that are in chat right now. Should I continue to play Boneworks? Like am I like, should I just keep

370
01:39:20,010 --> 01:39:49,020
going or what do you think? Hey, this is a four hour game. I feel like it's longer than that.

371
01:39:49,020 --> 01:40:15,529
I knocked him over. We're good. That's not going to shoot me, right? I don't have an inventory full

372
01:40:15,529 --> 01:40:27,369
of stuff. Uh, yeah. I took a bunch of guns. Oh, come on. What employee promotion raffle? Um,

373
01:40:27,369 --> 01:40:38,489
it's like 10 hours. It's cool, but I kind of feel like I'm just moving from like portal room to

374
01:40:38,489 --> 01:40:44,119
portal room. It's like, I didn't, I didn't think this was going to be like a puzzle game. This is

375
01:40:44,119 --> 01:40:57,909
not what I thought it was going to be. The shooter part starts like now. That's what I kind of, I

376
01:40:57,909 --> 01:41:05,659
want, I don't want to just leave immediately. I want to kind of see. Can I go in that door?

377
01:41:05,659 --> 01:41:15,750
Oh, it's a fake door. All right. So I got to find the key, obviously. And the key's probably like

378
01:41:15,750 --> 01:41:36,039
over here. What the? I thought I knocked it over. Guns in this game are fun. Yeah. Um, I'm moving on.

379
01:41:36,039 --> 01:41:57,430
That was Boneworks. There's a button on the back of the gun. Yeah, we're gonna, I'm moving on.

380
01:41:57,430 --> 01:42:03,460
It's, this, this game's like 10 hours and I, I kind of wish I didn't do the whole tutorial then.

381
01:42:03,460 --> 01:42:15,140
I feel like I'm invested at this point, which is unfortunate. Um, you literally stopped before

382
01:42:15,140 --> 01:42:37,210
it got interesting. I know, right? And that's like, I pressed this. What is he doing? Can I

383
01:42:37,210 --> 01:42:52,489
press the button? Please get the fuck out of here. I learned this from wrestling empire,

384
01:42:52,489 --> 01:43:10,420
motherfucker. Come back to it another time. All right. Yeah. We're moving on. It's like four

385
01:43:10,420 --> 01:43:30,390
different games tied to the tutorial. All right. Boneworks. That was Boneworks. We're going to move

386
01:43:30,390 --> 01:43:38,920
on to one. I think I'm going to have a lot of fun. That was a journalist. I, I was kind of boring.

387
01:43:38,920 --> 01:43:46,180
I have to be completely honest with you. I think I thought, I thought it was kind of boring.

388
01:43:46,180 --> 01:44:03,350
Tape the cable. It's better later on. Yeah. It's like two, it's a tutorial physics showcase. And

389
01:44:03,350 --> 01:44:07,819
then the game, there's a lot of people don't get into Boneworks and a lot of people get very

390
01:44:07,819 --> 01:44:13,750
mad when people don't get into Boneworks. I mean, I, have you bet? I mean, it's look with

391
01:44:13,750 --> 01:44:17,430
the knuckle controllers, that was fucking cool. I had a lot of fun and like to just jump around

392
01:44:17,430 --> 01:44:25,300
and throw things and shoot stuff. It was, I mean, look, if it's a 10 hour game, I only stream for

393
01:44:25,300 --> 01:44:32,329
like five to six hours. I'm probably not going to do the whole thing. I hated this game at the start,

394
01:44:32,329 --> 01:44:36,090
but pushing through it ended up being kind of worth it. It does suck at the start, but that can't

395
01:44:36,090 --> 01:44:44,890
be, oh, oh, well that's all right. Maybe we'll come back to it. It was fun. I just, it was,

396
01:44:44,890 --> 01:44:48,789
I guess I was expecting something else somehow. I don't know why I went in. I don't know why I

397
01:44:48,789 --> 01:44:56,630
went in with an expectation. That was, all right, we're going to move on. I turned the gun on.

398
01:44:57,670 --> 01:45:27,899
All right, we're going to move on to, uh, I want to play the baseball game. All right. Let's,

399
01:45:27,899 --> 01:45:35,159
let's, let's put, let's get the energy up. Are you guys ready? Are you ready for more high energy?

400
01:45:35,159 --> 01:45:52,779
Weekly meltdown? What? I do have to change this, but that's not what we're playing. Does this even

401
01:45:52,859 --> 01:46:09,000
have a, I don't even, I'm not even sure this is on steam or on Twitch. Oh yeah, it is. All right.

402
01:46:09,640 --> 01:46:22,659
Well, it's ready. Hey there, all you bat swingers out there in VR land. DJ Debbie here to keep

403
01:46:22,659 --> 01:46:27,779
things cooking with some of your fave hits from around the globe. Relax and sit back. All right,

404
01:46:27,779 --> 01:46:34,180
time for high energy. I don't know. You know what it was? I think that game just made me like low

405
01:46:34,180 --> 01:46:41,479
energy. I don't know what it did. I don't know why it was just like, I got, I started to be,

406
01:46:41,479 --> 01:46:59,560
I was like, let's go. This chord is really tangled though. I blame the music. No,

407
01:47:00,760 --> 01:47:07,850
are we going to do some untangling? I just spit that all over myself.

408
01:47:08,489 --> 01:47:12,579
All right, which way do I got to turn this way? Find out.

409
01:47:17,859 --> 01:47:26,409
I can't wait for this. This is going to be awesome. All right. I really got to be careful. I

410
01:47:26,409 --> 01:47:29,449
don't actually hurt myself here because I'm going to be super into this.

411
01:47:34,069 --> 01:47:59,220
You ready? All right. Character. Whoa. Okay. Head. I like that one. I don't think it really matters

412
01:47:59,859 --> 01:48:27,270
over that one. Face. All right. That one. Body. That one's fine. This one's fine. What about,

413
01:48:27,270 --> 01:48:47,779
can I make it brown? Facial hair? No, none. No, I'm not doing that. All right. Confirm. All right. I

414
01:48:47,779 --> 01:48:57,859
get it. I'm so excited. Here we go. Always hold both controllers when playing this game. Okay.

415
01:48:59,060 --> 01:49:06,420
Are you, I'm right-handed. Choose your locomotion. Running. To move, hold down the buttons.

416
01:49:07,060 --> 01:49:10,020
I freaked out. I thought this was like a local Vegas radio station.

417
01:49:11,300 --> 01:49:20,619
Hold down the buttons lighting up on your controller and swing your, whoa. Okay.

418
01:49:21,579 --> 01:49:35,539
I don't know if I really like that. That's too much. Walk by holding down the trackpad thumbsticks.

419
01:49:35,539 --> 01:49:42,550
Okay. Yeah. That's hold down bolt. Yeah. Okay. That's much better. Some players have issues

420
01:49:42,550 --> 01:49:45,909
with locomotion. So we've given you an option to create a projection of your character when

421
01:49:45,909 --> 01:49:50,699
doing movement inputs to allow you to see your destination before teleporting there.

422
01:49:53,130 --> 01:50:01,430
Let's just go. All right. Announcer. Practice. Pitching practice. I'm ready.

423
01:50:05,739 --> 01:50:21,500
Oh, here we go. Oh, this is, all right. This is going to be sick. You got a Mega Man hand

424
01:50:24,279 --> 01:50:42,359
ball. Do I, I don't have to actually throw it. Right. You actually have to catch the ball too.

425
01:50:42,359 --> 01:50:51,340
All right. This is cool. Hey, do I have to actually catch the balls? Oh, wait a minute. Quick menu.

426
01:50:51,340 --> 01:51:21,000
Cannon. What? Oh no. Wait. Left. I can't give it to me. Fuck. This is so hard. And you actually,

427
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:30,470
you actually have to grab too. I'm going to, maybe I shouldn't do manual. Maybe it's going to be too

428
01:51:30,470 --> 01:51:54,970
hard. There we go. All right. Just takes a little bit of getting used to. I'm going to do that so

429
01:51:54,970 --> 01:52:05,300
often. All right. I get it. I get it. I like it. Let's go. Okay. Now I want to do hitting. I want

430
01:52:05,300 --> 01:52:16,100
to do hitting tutorial, batting practice. Dude, if this is okay, if this is as fun as I think it's

431
01:52:16,100 --> 01:52:28,010
going to be no fucking way. Are you kidding me? This is like, we, this is everything I wanted from

432
01:52:28,810 --> 01:52:54,310
Oh my God. It's like exact one to one. Shit. Where'd the bat go? Damn it. Okay. I'm swinging late.

433
01:52:54,310 --> 01:53:16,869
Swing early. There we go. All right. I'm hitting the top of the ball. Stand back. Am I too close?

434
01:53:16,869 --> 01:53:31,479
Keep dropping the bat. Baseball is back. You keep bunting. I'm trying not to bunt. It's,

435
01:53:31,479 --> 01:53:42,979
you got to slow down. All right. All right. Yeah. I, I, I, I got to back it up like here.

436
01:53:42,979 --> 01:53:55,689
What is it? What is it doing? Get off. Fucking index. What are you doing? All right. One more.

437
01:53:55,689 --> 01:54:06,939
I got to get under the ball more. I'm too far over it. Kill the batter. I mean,

438
01:54:10,500 --> 01:54:30,729
I have to get the ball in the air. This is such a good weakling. All right. Why does every VR game

439
01:54:30,729 --> 01:54:47,020
have the same song that's looped on five seconds? I don't know. Cannon. All right. I got the hang of

440
01:54:47,020 --> 01:55:06,489
it. I'm ready. Okay. Let's do it. Play ball. Easy against the sloths. I can't do anything else.

441
01:55:06,489 --> 01:55:18,060
How many innings? We'll start with three. I don't want to do nine innings. Wait, why am I the

442
01:55:18,060 --> 01:55:48,069
announcer? Why am I announcing the game? Oh shit. All right. I'm ready. Oh my God.

443
01:55:58,659 --> 01:56:17,189
Yeah, whatever. I just, I'm warming up. Okay. I'm fine. Wait, can he run? Wait, he can run. Hey,

444
01:56:17,189 --> 01:56:42,710
don't let him run yet. Oh my God. This is crazy. Come on. I got to release like earlier. Oh my God.

445
01:56:42,710 --> 01:57:04,409
I can't. What happened? You actually field the balls. Can you hit the batter? Stop, turn off,

446
01:57:04,409 --> 01:57:26,329
throwing assist. Is that going to help me? What the fuck? Why? I'm not. Turn it on. Oh, I thought

447
01:57:26,329 --> 01:57:49,239
you said turn it off. Do I have to actually run as the runner? My back went fast. Fuck. Come on,

448
01:57:49,239 --> 01:58:11,529
dude. God, I can't. That's a strike. That's a fucking strike. Good thing out of here. Wait,

449
01:58:11,529 --> 01:58:38,840
who's? What? I'm so confused. I threw it that far. This guy is a psycho. There it is. All right. I

450
01:58:38,840 --> 01:59:06,840
think I got it. All right. Up. Get it. I think I have to stand back a little more. Oh my God.

451
01:59:07,479 --> 02:00:12,090
I'm just going to use the cannon. Fuck it. God damn it. Strike. Give me the fucking cannon.

452
02:00:12,090 --> 02:00:31,829
Give me the cannon. I don't care. Give me the fucking cannon. I can't hurt them. Wow. That was

453
02:00:31,829 --> 02:01:01,529
bad. Give me it. What? Get it. Get it. Get that ball and throw it over there. Oh, I wonder if

454
02:01:01,529 --> 02:01:42,729
it's going to be a ball. Wait, can I, can he, can he hit it from here? Oh, damn it. What are you

455
02:01:42,729 --> 02:02:12,649
doing? Boneworks lost to this. Yeah. I'm actually like, I'm like enjoying myself. Fuck. All right.

456
02:02:12,649 --> 02:02:28,619
Time for my turn. Low blood sugar. Andy, what are you talking about? Low. Whoa. Okay.

457
02:02:35,819 --> 02:03:00,420
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. What? Why am I still at the plate? That's way, way outside.

458
02:03:00,420 --> 02:03:34,680
Way outside. Go, go, go, go, go. Why am I so slow? I got to get like in there. Like in there. Safe.

459
02:03:34,680 --> 02:04:01,430
That's a hit. Oh. Somebody just called me a fuck boy. Why?

460
02:04:14,180 --> 02:04:23,609
I got it. All right. This is actually really fun. Can you imagine playing this at two player

461
02:04:23,609 --> 02:04:30,699
with multiplayer? This would be so good. All right. Down and in.

462
02:04:32,920 --> 02:04:46,500
There it is. Out. He's gone. He's having fun. I am having fun.

463
02:04:47,460 --> 02:05:17,449
Hold on. Hey, Sally. Good to see you. I want to get a strike so bad. I'm just ruining the

464
02:05:17,449 --> 02:05:39,159
game for everybody. Oh, come on. Turn off the movement vignette. Can I? See if I can turn it

465
02:05:39,159 --> 02:05:49,899
off. I don't think I can turn off the movement vignette. Don't break you back. I'm good.

466
02:05:51,880 --> 02:05:59,989
Well prepared. Don't ever look when you're running to first base. It's a huge mistake.

467
02:06:09,579 --> 02:06:40,119
Oh my God. Go. He sucks so much. It's difficult. All right. Come on. Strike.

468
02:06:40,119 --> 02:06:55,770
Wasn't even in the batter's box. I got it. I don't know how I got it, but I did.

469
02:06:58,619 --> 02:07:37,159
That's so cool. Got it. That ugly ass vignette. Yeah. I don't know. It is weird. That's not a home

470
02:07:37,159 --> 02:08:04,920
run, right? Okay. I don't even. Where's that player? Oh, you're you. What the fuck? I have

471
02:08:04,920 --> 02:08:22,539
to catch it too? What kind of Bugs Bunny shit is that? I have to throw the ball and then catch

472
02:08:22,539 --> 02:08:54,149
the ball that I throw. Oh, fuck. I should have laid out for it. Get out of the way. Oh my God.

473
02:08:54,149 --> 02:09:25,510
All right. This is my last chance. Fucking run. I did. Okay. I got it. All right. I'm good.

474
02:09:25,510 --> 02:09:46,939
That's a ball. Go. One handed baseball. I mean, it's hard to do it. I'm doing better than it was

475
02:09:46,939 --> 02:10:17,989
last time. Damn it. No, that's I'm good. Man on first and second. You're not going to catch it.

476
02:10:17,989 --> 02:10:32,779
I know I'm good. I got it. I got it. I got one more. One more. One more. One more. All right.

477
02:10:32,779 --> 02:10:45,430
We're good. All right. All right. All right. Right. I'm I got it this time. It's loss of

478
02:10:45,430 --> 02:11:06,979
fucked. Let's go. Just back off the plate. No more vignette either. We're good. Oh, thank God.

479
02:11:06,979 --> 02:11:20,649
Resident sleeper. Let me enjoy my baseball game. Don't worry. Do I have it? Who has it?

480
02:11:20,649 --> 02:11:47,939
Where's the ball? What? What happened? I don't understand what happened. Double play. Let's go.

481
02:11:47,939 --> 02:12:14,039
He's coming back. Give me the ball. You have to catch it on your own. There we go. All right.

482
02:12:14,039 --> 02:12:25,850
I'm backing way off the plate. I wasn't even ready. That's bullshit. Oh my God. Just throw

483
02:12:25,850 --> 02:12:51,000
me out. I don't care. Dead there. Oh, come on. Throw it. You want to go pickle. You want to do a

484
02:12:51,000 --> 02:13:36,390
pickle. This is the technique. I got it. Ball. This is so stupid. Run back. Why are you running

485
02:13:36,390 --> 02:13:57,590
that far? What the fuck are you doing? Why would you do that? I have to like move with it. The

486
02:13:57,590 --> 02:14:23,909
fair ball. That's not a fair ball. Wait, what just happened? Are you fucking kidding me? Oh,

487
02:14:23,909 --> 02:14:41,989
always run it out. Always run out the first base. You all, you know that. Oh my God. Why did you

488
02:14:41,989 --> 02:14:59,369
stop? Cause I just thought I was gone. I can't do it. It's so fucking awkward. I know the arrow is

489
02:14:59,369 --> 02:15:06,710
there, but it's like weird. I'm like facing a completely different direction. You high.

490
02:15:07,270 --> 02:15:17,220
You think I would play VR high? Are you out of your mind? You were in the batter's box.

491
02:15:17,220 --> 02:15:38,340
Give me a break. I've done VR high. No, I've drank and played VR and that was fucking hell,

492
02:15:38,340 --> 02:15:57,689
but it was fun. There we go. All right. Come on. Safe. Nice. Do I keep going? What's the score?

493
02:15:57,689 --> 02:16:49,909
Zero zero. Mike muted. What do you mean? Nice cam. Sorry. All right. I got men on first and second.

494
02:16:49,909 --> 02:16:53,430
Base is loaded. All right. Let me give me a home run right now. Come on. I got to impress

495
02:16:53,430 --> 02:17:09,719
everybody in chat. Finally see his balls. That's it. There we go. Finally my first run ever.

496
02:17:09,719 --> 02:17:45,399
Okay. This is pog. Yeah. Fuck. Whatever. Run. It's all right. It's all right. What the hell

497
02:17:45,399 --> 02:18:16,200
just happened? Attacking me. Stop facing the guy. Why are you swinging downwards? Cause every time

498
02:18:16,200 --> 02:18:35,159
I try to swing upwards, I never get the ball in the air. How come computer hit far, but you know,

499
02:18:39,799 --> 02:19:17,209
Oh shit. I won. All right. That was fun. Now what? Where are we going now? Let's see. Where are we

500
02:19:17,209 --> 02:19:39,290
going? I got a lot of shit here. How about time hacker? Pull up your pants. I, I, oh boy. It's

501
02:19:39,290 --> 02:19:59,299
time for time hacker settings. Ambient. 100%. How do I change that? Oh, voice. There's a voices

502
02:19:59,299 --> 02:20:07,780
timer on hand. Right height autos. Fine. Reset progress. Okay. Take control, teleport and

503
02:20:07,780 --> 02:20:25,909
rotation. Can we continuous motion dash grab? Shoot. I'll figure it out. Let's go. Hello time

504
02:20:25,909 --> 02:20:32,549
hacker. Welcome to AI development. Now I will take you on a tour and you will show what you are

505
02:20:32,549 --> 02:20:41,610
capable of as you increase the size of the sphere. Time slows down when you make the time

506
02:20:41,610 --> 02:20:49,219
completely expand the sphere until it breaks. What the hell move to an indicated place using

507
02:20:49,219 --> 02:20:59,860
continuous move. Try to move by dashing. Open the door. All right. Wait, that's me. I'm moving so

508
02:20:59,860 --> 02:21:17,299
fast. Open the door. How do I do that? Okay. Try to turn using the controller. This person is very,

509
02:21:17,299 --> 02:21:21,989
this is like a very close to their mic with a high compressor. I love it. Right. Do what with

510
02:21:21,989 --> 02:21:32,709
the controller? All right. It's like snap movements, fucking fluid. I like it. Movement is very fluid.

511
02:21:32,709 --> 02:21:51,190
It's very good. Teleport to the indicated place. Teleport. Oh, all right. Pretty fluid.

512
02:21:57,620 --> 02:22:02,379
Uh, can one of the, if one of the mods is here, can they make, um, can they make a,

513
02:22:02,379 --> 02:22:13,450
can they change the game name to a time, uh, classic, whatever it's called? Oh shit. That's

514
02:22:13,450 --> 02:22:25,209
me. Time hacker. I will destroy everyone and you can't stop me. Notify something, say about

515
02:22:25,209 --> 02:22:35,620
first. Activate the virus. Do I have to slow down time? This guy's moving like he's in VR.

516
02:22:43,299 --> 02:22:56,620
Now kill him. Kill me. Time to die. Oh shit. This is 2501. Our first AI development that failed.

517
02:22:56,620 --> 02:23:02,780
He managed to get our robots out of the control. Only you can control them and stop him.

518
02:23:03,420 --> 02:23:10,459
Show what you can do. Expand the sphere until it breaks. Point your hand at, hold the button.

519
02:23:10,459 --> 02:23:16,940
Point your hand at the enemy. Hold the button and pull towards you to leave the body. What?

520
02:23:16,940 --> 02:23:23,239
It's the same button. Look at this guy. I just realized that I'm like a super jacked

521
02:23:23,799 --> 02:23:33,700
Batman guy. Try to get back into the character. Excellent. Now you're ready for real resistance.

522
02:23:33,700 --> 02:23:42,549
Really? Okay. Until the enemies spot us, make them destroy each other. What to stop time completely

02:23:58,629 --> 02:24:13,420

526
02:24:13,420 --> 02:24:24,309
body. I'm a fucking time hacker. You can't kill me. Wait, how did I miss him? What the fuck? Until

02:25:34,780 --> 02:25:40,629
Destroy the enemies on the level. All right, I gotta get into this guy.

533
02:25:48,299 --> 02:26:01,930
Got it. Nice. Oh, this is, this is fun. Oh my God. If the enemy is in a headset,

534
02:26:01,930 --> 02:26:05,770
you can't control of him. Oh, I can't control that guy. I can do this though.

All right, now get in that guy. All right, get me out of here. I gotta get out. Got him. Fuck.

02:26:39,059 --> 02:26:48,440
That was from Minecraft. That was from Minecraft.

537
02:26:52,739 --> 02:27:00,260
If the enemy is in a headset, you can't take control of him. Holy shit. Okay, you and then you.

538
02:27:00,260 --> 02:27:19,739
Do I just hit the head? Yes.

539
02:27:27,659 --> 02:27:28,379
What the fuck?

540
02:27:28,379 --> 02:27:33,180
Ruminant enemies can be grabbed and moved. Push the enemy into the turbine.

541
02:27:35,959 --> 02:27:44,309
What the fuck? How do I push him in?

542
02:27:44,549 --> 02:28:00,649
All right, you spin around. Headshot this guy. You shoot. Headshot this guy. Wait, where is he?

543
02:28:00,649 --> 02:28:10,170
Oh, he's dead. Oh, fuck. You point the gun at your own head. Oh, no, I can't. Let go of the gun.

544
02:28:10,170 --> 02:28:19,270
Shoot. Oh, that guy. I can't kill that guy. Oh, I think I'm dead. Wait, this guy. Wait,

02:28:35,399 --> 02:29:01,049
We're kind of like Tony Hawk, this guy. Okay. Oh, I was trying to like hit him like his, you know.

547
02:29:02,010 --> 02:29:23,559
All right, let's go. I can't do that. Why can't I do that? I'm just like a shell now. All right,

548
02:29:23,559 --> 02:29:41,159
I can't. All right, hold on. I can't do that. It's time to die. All right, let's go. Get me out.

549
02:29:46,120 --> 02:30:04,870
What? I pushed him in. Oh, my God. Okay. This is awesome. So, now what? Start. I don't know

550
02:30:04,870 --> 02:30:13,879
what I'm starting. Oh, okay. Tutorials easy. Base tutorials. All right. So, I think I have to beat

551
02:30:13,879 --> 02:30:35,879
these. What the? It's just us. Are you fucking kidding me? I can move the bullet out of the way?

552
02:30:36,600 --> 02:31:10,549
Get out. Get out. Get out. Get out. This is Quicksilver. No, give me that back. I'm going

553
02:31:10,549 --> 02:32:09,049
to kill myself. Am I dead? No, I don't want to die. Is that going to do anything? Oh, shit. Okay. I

554
02:32:09,049 --> 02:32:24,360
got to put it over here. All right. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it.

02:32:31,350 --> 02:33:08,729
Oh, fuck. Put it down. Put it down. Holy shit. Put this down right here and then put it down.

556
02:33:08,729 --> 02:33:17,260
Put it down. Try and shoot this guy. No. What the fuck just happened? Okay. This is all right.

557
02:33:17,260 --> 02:33:45,989
It's fine. It's fine. It's fine. It's fine. Get in his head. Are you kidding me? That's not a second.

558
02:33:45,989 --> 02:34:20,680
What the fuck? That was so stupid. How do I kill this guy? I have to wait. Oh, fuck. I have to wait.

559
02:34:22,379 --> 02:34:34,840
Wait. Can I? I can't pull him down. I can't manipulate him. But the barrel. The barrel can

560
02:34:34,840 --> 02:35:08,680
float. All right. I should probably wait. I'm going to wait. No. Get over here. He's going to

562
02:35:21,829 --> 02:35:53,020
Why is it doing that? Got it. This is so fucking fun. Oh, God. Oh, my God. Oh, God. I missed. I

563
02:35:53,020 --> 02:36:02,620
missed. I missed. I missed. I missed. I think I missed. But who kills this guy? He's going to

564
02:36:02,620 --> 02:36:09,479

02:36:09,479 --> 02:36:22,090
another barrel here. I got to think about this. OK. Go. OK. Give me this. He's going to get blown

566
02:36:22,090 --> 02:36:28,459
by that. He's going to shoot this. OK. You shoot that. You shoot this one here. Shoot that one.

567
02:36:30,520 --> 02:36:47,909
Now you shoot the barrel. Got it. Oh, that feels good when you get it right. Hold on. I got to

568
02:36:47,909 --> 02:37:10,620
spin. Two more. One more. Oh, all right. OK. This one is. I'm really into this. This game's

569
02:37:10,620 --> 02:37:23,530
actually really cool. Dynamite can be attached directly to enemies. Oh, my God. They're going to

570
02:37:23,530 --> 02:37:50,069
have timer on them. Oh, shit. Give me that. OK. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. What happened to his?

571
02:37:51,530 --> 02:38:11,940
Wait. I didn't. I put it on his neck. Dynamite can be attached directly to enemies. One, two,

572
02:38:11,940 --> 02:38:36,040
three. Good. That's good to know. They blow up. Holy shit. What? Can I drop a box on his head?

573
02:38:42,600 --> 02:39:02,969
I don't know. I'm confused. Is there something here? What? Why is he? How do I turn it on?

574
02:39:11,350 --> 02:39:32,260
OK. Banana peels can only be attached to the floor. Banana peels right under his foot. Like

575
02:39:32,260 --> 02:39:53,260
right here. That was a really good like a pratfall. Give me that. Can I take the sword

576
02:39:53,260 --> 02:40:11,719
out of his hand? Give me that. I can't. Let me have a gun. Oops. Wait. Can I get it now?

577
02:40:11,719 --> 02:40:25,459
Oh, God damn it. What am I missing? Am I missing something? Oh, the. All right. There's a. OK.

579
02:40:47,030 --> 02:41:08,280
Got it. What about be careful and dodge flying objects?

580
02:41:10,940 --> 02:41:19,110
Wait. I don't think I dodged that. That happened so quickly.

581
02:41:19,110 --> 02:41:26,309
Be careful and dodge flying objects. Oh, my God. No, no, no, no, no, no. Move.

582
02:41:35,020 --> 02:41:39,100
What the fuck just happened? Where did I go?

583
02:41:41,379 --> 02:42:09,129
Was that my body? I think that was my body. Where should I take this guy?

584
02:42:12,629 --> 02:42:25,290
I think I've killed him already. Wait. Hold on. Is that going to? That's going to kill me.

585
02:42:26,010 --> 02:42:53,850
Get back in my body. Quick. Oh, damn it. Whoa. We're good. No, no, I got to. What should I do?

Come here. OK. And then I didn't get him. Thank you, Freddy. What happened? What the fuck?

587
02:43:29,879 --> 02:43:40,420
There's a helicopter. No, don't kill me. Holy shit. Who has a gun? Anybody have a gun?

588
02:43:40,420 --> 02:44:05,829
Oh, boy. I need to go into my body quick. And then. Oh, shit. Is that going to hit him? Did I hit him?

589
02:44:07,030 --> 02:44:17,670
I have to get all back over to my body. Oh, my God. I can't shoot that guy. I can't even

590
02:44:17,670 --> 02:44:28,329
get out of this. I can't get out of this. That will click the button. I think I just lose.

591
02:44:29,049 --> 02:44:43,799
Oh, well. OK. All right. I got to be ready for this. OK. Who has a gun? You shoot that guy.

592
02:44:44,760 --> 02:44:54,940
Fuck. That's going to be the last thing I do then, right? I can't get back over there.

593
02:44:55,579 --> 02:45:34,440
Teleport. Oh, my God. I forgot I had that. Oh, oh, my God. Nice. All right. What happened?

02:46:06,409 --> 02:46:10,329
Rescue the hostages and don't forget to destroy your enemies.

598
02:46:11,049 --> 02:46:25,750
Am I the only person? Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God. No. What? Rescue the hostages

We're good. You're safe. Got it. My God. You have to shoot. OK, get in here.

02:48:00,860 --> 02:48:14,010
he's going to T-pose. He looks like somebody. Oh, God. You're fine over here. Oh, shit. OK,

604
02:48:14,010 --> 02:48:21,420
now you have to go just hang out over here for a second. Stay right there. You.

605
02:48:24,889 --> 02:48:29,000
How do I kill him? How do I kill this guy?

606
02:48:35,500 --> 02:49:00,780
That should do it, right? Oh, my bullshit. That was horseshit. Oh, help, help me. Oh, shit.

607
02:49:03,260 --> 02:49:10,790
I can't get back up. Can I catch him? All right. I think I can catch him from here. No, I'm good.

608
02:49:13,030 --> 02:49:50,790
No. Fuck. Teleport. Right. Sit down. Good. Oh, come on. You. I can't believe it's fucking my crap.

Oh, wait. Shooting was shooting missiles.

02:51:04,569 --> 02:51:21,350
Am I good? I think that's it. Holy shit. Oh, boy. Oh, God. Let's do this one.

02:51:44,090 --> 02:52:17,209
Are we good? I think I got it. I got it. Oh, fuck. Oh, shit. Who kills that guy? Who kills that guy?

615
02:52:22,680 --> 02:52:47,159
I don't know who kills this guy. I think I'm dead. Oh, come on. Wait. What about the guy in the

616
02:52:47,159 --> 02:53:24,739
helicopter? Oh, that shit kind of worked. I think I got it. I got it. I got it. That's it. I win.

Get down. What? I saved him. I saved him. I saved him. They didn't get hurt. This guy sucks.

619
02:53:51,110 --> 02:54:39,559
I'm getting tangled. Who kills this guy? Me. And then this guy has to shoot. No, no, no.

620
02:54:43,510 --> 02:55:02,540
Come on. Come with me. Come with me. No. Safe. That's it. What the fuck? He shot the same guy

621
02:55:02,540 --> 02:55:25,159
twice. Fuck. Whatever. All right. One or two more and we'll move on. Oh, shit. Get out of there.

622
02:55:25,159 --> 02:55:30,600
It's going to fucking electrocute everybody. Get out. Get out of there. OK. We're good.

623
02:55:31,829 --> 02:55:52,620
That's going to zap him, right? Who is that not zapping? It's wrong. What was wrong? What happened?

624
02:55:52,620 --> 02:56:15,379
I don't understand. I thought I did it right. I get it. No. I threw her across the map.

625
02:56:15,860 --> 02:56:37,899
I just I tossed her across the map. How is she getting electrocuted? Come here. Sit in this chair.

626
02:56:39,479 --> 02:57:09,190
All right. You're safe. Let's go. Done. We're good. All right. Let's do. All right. One more.

02:57:09,190 --> 02:57:18,389
These ones. Time hacker. This is like my favorite game. Redirect the car by turning the steering

628
02:57:18,389 --> 02:57:34,469
wheel. What? Are you serious? This is so stupid. Well, then how do I get him to die?

629
02:57:34,549 --> 02:57:55,559
Wait. He's dead. That seems like that. OK. Whatever. I'm not going to. I'm not going to fucking

630
02:57:55,559 --> 02:58:13,700
ask any questions. I've turned around so many times. We're good. We're good. I think. Hold on.

Let me make sure I didn't like pull the cord out. I think we're good. Yeah, we're good. All right.

What's going on here? You shoot this guy in the head and then car. Oh shit. There's another guy.

635
03:00:02,940 --> 03:00:13,639
Wait, I have an idea. Just hit him both with the car. All right. Let's do it. That should be good.

636
03:00:22,600 --> 03:00:38,860
OK. All right. Last one and we're going to do another game.

637

640
03:02:26,149 --> 03:02:51,799
Space Channel 5, baby. Ready Space Channel? What happened to chat? Hey, you guys aren't there

641
03:02:56,229 --> 03:03:10,739

03:03:10,739 --> 03:03:13,860
I'm going to take a break. It's been three hours. Holy shit. I've been playing for three hours.

643
03:03:14,739 --> 03:03:19,209
Yeah, I'm going to take a quick break. I'm going to pee. Get some more water and we'll come back

644
03:03:19,209 --> 03:10:33,770
with a Space Channel. Either that or maybe I'll pick one. Can you hear me? How are you doing? Good.

645
03:10:36,409 --> 03:10:59,719
Oh, so let's do. I think I need a Space Channel. Dino Extinction. Turn the compressor off.

646
03:11:00,840 --> 03:11:20,520
Is it too slow? Well, it's because I don't have the headset on right now. The headset's like

647
03:11:20,520 --> 03:11:29,079
resting over here. It's fine. Yeah, I think it looks all right. All right. Space Channel. And

03:12:05,829 --> 03:12:15,959
VR like this. All right. Dino Eruption is what we're going to play. Time Hacker was a solid

652
03:12:15,959 --> 03:12:22,840
experience. It was very, very much pleasantly supplied. I can't even talk. I can't even say

653
03:12:22,840 --> 03:12:31,350
words. VR just takes so much out of you. I have the L.A. Noire VR files. I got a lot of stuff.

654
03:12:31,350 --> 03:12:36,299
This is what we're doing for the... I'm streaming like three times this week. You're not just getting

655
03:12:36,299 --> 03:12:43,139
one stream, Andy, here. I'm streaming today, tomorrow, and then probably Saturday or Sunday.

656
03:12:43,139 --> 03:12:48,889
Probably Sunday. Or we're doing today and then like Saturday, Sunday. I haven't figured that out yet.

657
03:12:48,889 --> 03:13:01,370
But I'm going to stream three times. Did I lose the chat again? There it is. All right. Dino

658
03:13:01,370 --> 03:13:09,770
Eruption is what we're going to start with. If I can figure out how to get it to work. There we go.

659
03:13:09,770 --> 03:13:23,000
Dino Eruption. Here we go. I can come back to you guys so you can see. And this is very tricky with

660
03:13:24,979 --> 03:13:41,639
this. It should be working. Okay, there you are. Press and... What the fuck is all this?

661
03:13:42,600 --> 03:14:00,569
Dino Eruption. Why is all this stuff all over my arms? Press and hold the marked button

662
03:14:01,209 --> 03:14:17,500
for laser interactor. Press and hold the marked button while holding scan button. Press the grip

663
03:14:17,500 --> 03:14:24,729
button to open menu. Wait, what? Holding scan button press. Oh, all right. There we go. How

664
03:14:24,729 --> 03:14:38,299
are we doing? Adjust height. What the fuck was that? Set height. Okay. Your current height. One.

665
03:14:38,860 --> 03:14:56,059
Your eye should be this high. A little more. All right. That looks good. Comfort options.

666
03:14:57,020 --> 03:15:09,260
No vignette. What's with the vignette? The game is really quiet. I can help you out there.

667
03:15:09,819 --> 03:15:26,790
Let me give you a hand there. Come on. There you go. All right. I'm ready. This game looked

668
03:15:26,790 --> 03:15:36,329
very interesting. I am very much excited for this one. Here we go. How do I get the fuck out of here?

669
03:15:36,329 --> 03:15:57,579
Okay. 100%. What is this? Zero times. So short he's off the screen. Juggles.

670
03:15:57,579 --> 03:16:16,540
Juggles. Stop talking about my fat stomach. Is there like a play the game button? Titan

671
03:16:16,540 --> 03:16:35,399
stomach. Stop it. The game sound. You're not in frame. I am now. Whoa. Juggles. This is not the

672
03:16:35,399 --> 03:16:46,569
game. I need to like leave. There's probably a door. How do I get the fuck out of here? Wait,

673
03:16:46,569 --> 03:17:17,770
menu. Start game. Press grip button to open menu. Where the fuck is that? Click the button. Do I

674
03:17:17,770 --> 03:17:28,489
have to restart the game? B button on Oculus. Yeah, that's what I'm... Oh my... What? I just

675
03:17:28,489 --> 03:17:44,809
pressed B. Okay. Fucking God. Touch marked button to move. Snap. Press the snap turn.

676
03:17:47,819 --> 03:17:59,819
What is this music? Press marked button to activate laser. Wait, press to mark for laser

677
03:17:59,819 --> 03:18:09,020
interactor? What the fuck? I don't know why that scared the shit out of me. That scared the

678
03:18:09,020 --> 03:18:29,139
absolute shit out of me. My whole body hurts. What the fuck? Anime intro? Sly dash. Swing,

679
03:18:29,139 --> 03:18:33,059
swing, swing, swing. Block, block, block, block. Cast magic. And then it cuts to like somebody.

680
03:18:33,059 --> 03:18:36,100
Show me Cameron. Really close on a mountain and the guy's fucking face and leans in and he's

681
03:18:36,100 --> 03:18:48,250
fucking got wind in his hair. Reach behind your head and release. All right. I'm scared. Oh,

682
03:18:49,209 --> 03:18:56,760
I just realized what was happening. We're in a... I can't look out there. I can't look out that

683
03:18:56,760 --> 03:19:05,370
window. I can't look out that window. I can't look out that window. Oh my God. Thank you for

684
03:19:05,370 --> 03:19:11,819
coming in. Time is unfortunate. This guy's proportions are strange. Press marked button

685
03:19:11,819 --> 03:19:20,600
to activate laser interactor. I don't know. I don't know what is... Press marked button

686
03:19:20,600 --> 03:19:24,120
to use laser interactor. I know you've not been on my security detail for long,

687
03:19:24,120 --> 03:19:31,190
but word has reached me of an impending threat to my family. I feel like I look like this guy.

688
03:19:31,190 --> 03:19:39,219
I kind of have like a small head and really long arms. Okay. My wife is the head of an exclusive

689
03:19:39,219 --> 03:19:44,500
facility that observes these creatures, some of which you see here displayed. Okay.

690
03:19:45,299 --> 03:19:52,200
A facility that you should be parachuting down to in approximately two minutes. That's a long time.

691
03:19:52,840 --> 03:19:57,940
Can we make it like 30 seconds? I have recently lost communication with my contacts there.

692
03:19:57,940 --> 03:20:10,379
An auspicious sign given what is coming. I can't pick up your chairs. Your mission is to find her.

693
03:20:10,379 --> 03:20:18,309
Dr. Layla Kessler. Protect her and get her to safety. You got it. And what will you be doing,

694
03:20:18,950 --> 03:20:23,979
sir? Are these dinosaurs? What's the threat? What's the threat?

695
03:20:23,979 --> 03:20:29,420
To put it concisely, I've received advanced reports of solar flares hitting the earth.

696
03:20:37,700 --> 03:20:42,659
Normally, I'm told these things are not cause for worry, just flashing lights colliding with

697
03:20:42,659 --> 03:20:47,540
earth's atmosphere. However, they do interfere with communications.

698
03:20:47,540 --> 03:21:05,879
You'd like dinosaurs. Two minutes and 36 seconds. Okay. I guess we're waiting the two minutes

699
03:21:06,840 --> 03:21:28,010
before I can leave. The last report recently stated they are getting vastly larger with a CME,

700
03:21:28,010 --> 03:21:33,479
a giant solar eruption predicted. By now, it may have already happened.

701
03:21:33,479 --> 03:21:43,510
Okay. You got it. I didn't work when I was over here.

702
03:21:43,510 --> 03:21:49,750
When it arrives, this may wipe out all advanced electronics on earth. The facility below has

703
03:21:49,750 --> 03:21:55,530
advanced electrical security systems to contain the research. The research?

704
03:21:56,629 --> 03:22:03,370
Oh. So find my wife and get her to safety before the eruption hits.

705
03:22:03,370 --> 03:22:10,469
Oh, find your wife. Okay. Before the eruption hits.

706
03:22:10,469 --> 03:22:14,569
Time to jump. Time to jump.

707
03:22:14,569 --> 03:22:18,409
Look at your arms. They will display any injuries. 100% health.

708
03:22:18,409 --> 03:22:26,100
Interact with various electronic devices such as machinery and doors.

709
03:22:26,100 --> 03:22:40,149
Whoa. How do I use it? Okay. I have a bow? You can practice further when on the ground.

710
03:22:40,149 --> 03:22:45,110
Keep my wife safe. Now look around and go to the marker by the-

711
03:22:45,110 --> 03:22:56,569
All right. Let's go. All right. I'm ready.

712
03:22:59,319 --> 03:23:07,659
Press the marked button to equip bow. While holding the bow button,

713
03:23:07,659 --> 03:23:13,340
point the laser on ammunition icon and press the left trigger button to choose your ammunition.

714
03:23:15,260 --> 03:23:45,079
Okay. Did I do it? Did I get it? I like hear it. How is he doing that?

715
03:24:00,409 --> 03:24:09,420
Okay. Press. Where is it? This music is so epic, but I can't fucking even do the tutorial.

716
03:24:15,450 --> 03:24:35,000
How do I? Oh, shit. The weak spot.

717
03:24:35,000 --> 03:24:43,190
Where's the weak spot? Right in his mouth. I swear to God. Just shoot him.

718
03:24:43,190 --> 03:24:53,700
The weak spot. And where is the weak spot? Mr. So-

719
03:25:03,510 --> 03:25:08,090
He's fucking dead. I killed that perfect crap. Using explosive robot arrows.

720
03:25:08,090 --> 03:25:11,049
Explosive robot arrows? I can steer the robot using your

721
03:25:11,049 --> 03:25:15,049
right touch pad or joystick, depending on your headset.

722
03:25:15,049 --> 03:25:52,229
What? Where am I? What am I doing? What? Do I got him?

723
03:25:55,290 --> 03:26:04,760
How? What did I just did? Okay. Press the what button to jump?

724
03:26:04,760 --> 03:26:15,110
Press the joystick. Oh, you press it in. Okay. That thing's going to fucking explode, dude.

725
03:26:15,110 --> 03:26:18,389
Why would I? We just like kept this guy in captivity so I could kill him with a bomb.

726
03:26:19,209 --> 03:26:35,260
That was fucked up. Okay. Connect with laser. Laser detected. I have to jump out of that?

727
03:26:35,260 --> 03:26:52,170
This seems like stupid. Hold on. Do I even have a parachute?

728
03:26:58,059 --> 03:27:02,680
I don't think I have a parachute on. I'm just going to jump out of the fucking plane?

729
03:27:23,860 --> 03:27:58,090
Was I supposed to do that? Whoa. I did turn around. What? Oh, shit. I made it. Okay.

730
03:27:58,729 --> 03:28:06,899
Press the grip button to grab a round surface. Move controller to climb.

731
03:28:07,620 --> 03:28:28,649
What can I help you with? Shit. Oh, man. I'm inside of it. What's going on?

732
03:28:28,649 --> 03:28:38,540
Whoa. There's a dinosaur over there. What's happening?

733
03:28:38,620 --> 03:28:46,620
What? Press the marked button to equip bow. What the fuck? Why is there a T-Rex over here?

734
03:28:46,620 --> 03:28:53,940
What the fuck? Behind your shoulder, press the trigger button to grab an arrow.

735
03:28:53,940 --> 03:29:12,520
I think I just blew myself up with a grenade. Print? Shit. Oh, he ate it?

736
03:29:15,909 --> 03:29:24,260
Hold on. Heal. What do I need to do? I don't have any arrows. I don't have any arrows.

737
03:29:24,260 --> 03:29:27,899
Do you have any arrows? You're talking to me now? We're in a bit of a daze there.

738
03:29:27,899 --> 03:29:29,420
Figured I'd take you up to see the dock.

739
03:29:34,459 --> 03:29:38,219
Fucking dinosaur. So, you're the rescue party? Where's the rest?

740
03:29:38,219 --> 03:29:45,420
And press right trigger button to respond. He's talking. It's the dinosaur talking.

741
03:29:47,020 --> 03:29:50,969
Thanks for the tutorial, T-Rex. I appreciate it, sonny.

742
03:29:50,969 --> 03:29:56,010
Dr. Kessler said we have it under control. But, oh, I don't know. A little something with

743
03:29:56,010 --> 03:30:04,379
giant teeth here tells me that might not be the whole story. Yeah. Anything else?

744
03:30:09,989 --> 03:30:16,680
I love this. Come on. Continue. Anyway, your bow there is good for putting the smaller ones to

745
03:30:16,680 --> 03:30:22,600
sleep. But I doubt it's going to help against our big friend here. What do you mean? Can that

746
03:30:22,600 --> 03:30:34,459
T-Rex get to us? Where are your guns? Where are your guns, dude? Guns? Not here. It's an observation

747
03:30:34,459 --> 03:30:40,889
facility, not a hunting range. If we have to, we use state-of-the-art electrical shockers,

748
03:30:40,889 --> 03:30:45,290
force weapons, and... Force weapons. ...tranquilizers like your little bow there fires.

749
03:30:47,959 --> 03:30:51,719
But I think this guy will need a bigger dosage than you got there.

750
03:30:51,719 --> 03:31:00,659
And why is he on... How did he get on this rock? All right. I'll get... Oh, shit. It's food.

751
03:31:05,500 --> 03:31:18,649
Why does he have like a big steak? Come here. Come here. Come get a steak. It's so stupid.

752
03:31:21,030 --> 03:31:29,579
I can't print any more steaks? Where's the doctor? She's just up ahead of the backup

753
03:31:29,579 --> 03:31:35,899
generator facility. He's freaking me out. I was just admiring this guy. I heard you can distract

754
03:31:35,899 --> 03:31:41,909
them with a bit of food. Sure. He looks distracted. He's like, yes, you can. I'm very distractible by

755
03:31:41,909 --> 03:31:52,059
food. He's correct. What is he doing? Okay. I was going to make some with the generator there

756
03:31:52,059 --> 03:31:57,420
and feed it to him so we can get by without any worry. Shall I give it a go?

757
03:32:02,420 --> 03:32:15,610
Sure. Show me. All right. Let's give this a go. Are you walking like that? Why is he walking like

758
03:32:15,610 --> 03:32:38,360
this? Why would you ever get this close? His shoes. His shoes came off. His shoes came off.

759
03:32:38,360 --> 03:32:46,219
Press the marked button to equip. What? Reach behind your shoulder and press trigger button

760
03:32:46,219 --> 03:32:56,040
to grab it. Eat this motherfucker. These dinosaurs think they can roam the fucking earth again.

761
03:32:56,040 --> 03:33:12,389
Not on my watch. So what? That guy's just gone. Am I stuck here? I think the whole thing is

762
03:33:12,389 --> 03:33:20,629
fucked up because that guy is like, oh my God. Everything about that was fucking amazing.

763
03:33:21,430 --> 03:33:36,540
Um, can I get out of here? This is like the, this is like the Disney rides and the universal rides

764
03:33:37,100 --> 03:33:41,579
from like back in the nineties and the eighties where you could literally be going that way.

765
03:33:41,579 --> 03:33:48,010
And King Kong is right there and you turn and King Kong is right here too. It's like, oh,

766
03:33:48,010 --> 03:33:57,379
there he is. King Kong fucking scary. And he, oh, okay. Reach behind your shoulder and grab.

767
03:33:57,860 --> 03:34:16,819
I don't have any, I don't have any arrows. Where am I? Use laser to print. Okay.

768
03:34:18,739 --> 03:34:27,659
Oh shit. Arrows. Do they get them? Arrows stored. Thank you. Okay. What about in here?

769
03:34:31,829 --> 03:34:45,620
What the fuck is that? Why do I hear that? Bombs stored. Bombs stored. Can I get in?

770
03:34:49,139 --> 03:35:05,899
Is that the T-Rex making that noise? Your health has been restored. Oh, okay. Is that

771
03:35:05,899 --> 03:35:35,399
a bad guy? Jump, jump. What happened? What happened? Why did that happen? I'm so confused.

772
03:35:36,659 --> 03:35:52,420
Hold on. Why were they, we keeping it in there? What is that? Okay. I want the bow. No, put this.

773
03:35:52,420 --> 03:36:11,930
Give me, give me, give me, give me. Not this again. Oh no. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

774
03:36:12,329 --> 03:36:25,399
Dr. Kessler. Okay. She's just at the backup generator. I've gotten bigger somehow. Show

775
03:36:25,399 --> 03:36:44,600
me how to feed him again. Don't do it. Don't do it. You're so much work. Your life is so much

776
03:36:44,600 --> 03:37:09,459
worth living for. Help. Press the marked button to equip bow. Why can I throw this shit? All right.

777
03:37:09,459 --> 03:37:14,659
Get me the fuck out of here. No, I'm getting out of here. I need, I want to go down.

778
03:37:26,860 --> 03:37:32,459
Okay. So behind the backup generator is where I need to go. I'm ready to try that or attempt it.

779
03:37:33,180 --> 03:37:40,090
Okay. Something exploded in here and I don't know what the hell it was.

780
03:37:41,700 --> 03:37:50,729
I don't know. Something, it was like a bomb. That fucking dinosaur.

781
03:37:51,610 --> 03:37:57,770
Uh, arrows stored. I'm not leaving this one yet. No fucking way. Not a chance.

782
03:37:58,649 --> 03:38:05,860
Bombs stored. Bombs stored. Your health has been restored. Okay. Here we go.

783
03:38:29,420 --> 03:38:36,010
I need to refill my health. Open. Oh God. Come on. All right. Well, whatever.

784
03:38:36,729 --> 03:38:44,409
I need to equip the bow. First of all, I got to back up. I'm way too close.

785
03:38:45,049 --> 03:38:54,709
Arrows stored. I also have to spin around. I'm so tangled. All right. What does this do?

786
03:38:55,350 --> 03:39:19,450
Connect with laser. Let go. What did it do? Laser detected. I have no idea. Okay. There are

787
03:39:19,450 --> 03:39:46,409
dinosaurs here. Do I have to do anything with them? Why am I going up here? That was so pointless.

788
03:39:46,409 --> 03:40:23,989
For what? Okay. I'm getting down. That hurt me that much. This ain't baseball.

789
03:40:24,709 --> 03:40:40,860
It's a petroterricitia. I feel like you can get out of here. What the fuck?

790
03:40:41,819 --> 03:41:10,489
It was an eagle. That's not, I want that. I want those. They're not doing anything.

791
03:41:16,950 --> 03:41:30,139
Arrows stored. Can I pet them? Hello. Yes. You're such a good boy. Stegosaurus. Come here.

792
03:41:30,139 --> 03:41:42,700
Come here. What's this one? Oh, it's like, it's an armadillo one. Hello. Okay. Where am I going now?

793
03:41:42,700 --> 03:41:56,709
I can't believe that guy got fucking eaten. What's happening over there? What is going on over

794
03:41:56,709 --> 03:42:15,049
there? Hold on. Did one escape? I wish I could move faster than this. You walk like you've been

795
03:42:15,049 --> 03:42:29,540
drinking. I'll take care of the dinosaur. Don't worry. That's true. I am just like,

796
03:42:29,540 --> 03:43:06,569
should have lopped it around. Okay. Okay. Am I launching a missile? Oh no. He turned into

797
03:43:06,569 --> 03:43:23,049
wood. He didn't even eat it. You're welcome. All right. I think I got to go that way.

798
03:43:25,290 --> 03:43:43,350
He's freaking me out. He can't get over that fence, right? Okay. I kind of need to see what

799
03:43:43,350 --> 03:43:55,290
else can happen in this game. Yeah. 19% health, 13 arrows. So is it kind of just like a Jurassic

800
03:43:55,290 --> 03:44:27,239
park where you just walk around and look at the animals? What's with my hands? Why is she

801
03:44:27,319 --> 03:44:34,309
fucking tiny? Hi. You must be my husband's newest security edition.

802
03:44:34,309 --> 03:44:36,149
Hope you'll last longer than your predecessor.

803
03:44:42,920 --> 03:44:46,120
Oh, no. What do I do?

804
03:44:55,659 --> 03:45:07,430
Can I feed her to the fucking T-Rex? Please, please let me feed her. Let me feed her to the T-Rex.

805
03:45:12,889 --> 03:45:26,469
No, no, no. Oh, God damn it. Fuck you. We already know what happens to you. Get him out of here.

806
03:45:31,579 --> 03:45:45,750
Why am I getting taller? Oh my God. Get me out of here. I can't believe. Oh, God damn it.

807
03:45:46,780 --> 03:45:52,459
I wanted to bring her over here and feed her to the T-Rex. All right. I don't care about what the

808
03:45:52,620 --> 03:45:58,219
I don't care about this game at all. I care about feeding that lady to a dinosaur. I don't care

809
03:45:58,219 --> 03:46:33,059
about anything else. Arrows stored. Okay. Let's go open it. Beach behind your shoulder and press

810
03:46:33,059 --> 03:47:11,139
trigger. Different monster in here. Fuck it. I'm just going up there. I'm good. I'm back. She keeps

811
03:47:11,139 --> 03:47:55,860
getting smaller. Yes. I am the new recruit. Every time I kill, I grow in size. So fucking bizarre.

812
03:47:55,860 --> 03:48:08,100
Oh my God. Dude, that's just, this is just not cool. Oh my God. Let go. Let go. I just,

813
03:48:08,100 --> 03:48:13,260
I gotta bring her over there and I gotta get her over the fence. Her neck.

814
03:48:18,069 --> 03:48:21,430
I just gotta get her over the fence. If I can throw her far enough. If he eats her.

815
03:48:21,989 --> 03:48:28,010
Okay. Place your bets. If he eats her, this is, I mean, this is gonna be the funniest thing ever.

816
03:48:29,670 --> 03:48:45,700
Oh, hold on. My underwear is coming up. All right. Can I do this?

817
03:48:52,700 --> 03:49:36,579
Shit. I need to. Damn it. No, I'm fine. I'm alive. I don't know if I'm gonna be able to do this.

818
03:49:37,139 --> 03:49:57,350
Too heavy. Wait, what about one of these guys? Why do they keep getting smaller? I don't understand.

819
03:49:57,350 --> 03:50:14,180
I don't think I can do it. I don't think I can. I think she's too heavy. Wait. Ah, shit. I gotta

820
03:50:14,180 --> 03:51:00,979
kill this guy. Where is he? Where is he? I think. Break forward. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go,

821
03:51:00,979 --> 03:51:55,750
go, go, go, go. What the fuck? I'm kicking in. I can't bring her. I can't. Fuck. I just see what

822
03:51:55,750 --> 03:52:12,020
she wants. Let me die. Hold on. Just die. Just die. Just die. I'm so disappointed. I can't take her.

823
03:52:12,020 --> 03:52:31,100
Fuck. Why am I still alive? Press the marked button to equip bow. Now you were in a bit of

824
03:52:31,100 --> 03:52:38,700
a daze there. I'm gonna be as big as you real soon. Press marked button. Laser interactor.

825
03:52:38,700 --> 03:52:54,680
Oh my god. Every time. This is important. Hold on. Hold on a second. I need to die like 10 more

826
03:52:54,680 --> 03:53:01,829
times because I want to be like so much bigger. I don't think I can even leave. All right,

827
03:53:01,829 --> 03:53:08,219
we'll just feed him already. So you the rescue party? Dr. Kessler said we have it under control.

828
03:53:08,219 --> 03:53:13,739
Anyway, you're little. Well, we had a power out and don't worry, the backup kicked in.

829
03:53:13,739 --> 03:53:17,899
Though I heard one or two of the dinos did get out of. I assume that's why you were here.

830
03:53:19,430 --> 03:53:28,549
Okay. Actually, she's just. I'm getting like winded. I was just admiring this guy. I'm getting

831
03:53:28,549 --> 03:53:34,620
winded. I might have to stop. I'm starting to get like seasick. But I have to power through

832
03:53:34,620 --> 03:53:46,360
because I have to see this one more time. Let's give this a go. Get in his way. Don't do it.

833
03:53:56,760 --> 03:54:06,020
What's happening? I'm going to puke. I'm going to puke. I'm going to puke. I'm going to puke.

834
03:54:06,020 --> 03:54:40,200
I'm going to puke. I'm going to puke. I'm going to puke. Give me a sec. Yeah, I gotta stop.

835
03:54:41,219 --> 03:54:47,620
In my view, the world like just got disconnected and I almost just fucking instantly threw up.

836
03:54:48,579 --> 03:55:02,569
Oh my god. That was fucking funny. The audio. I know.

837
03:55:07,639 --> 03:55:14,969
All right. So here's what we're going to do. I'm going to call it here because like, yeah,

838
03:55:14,969 --> 03:55:18,329
I'm actually starting to get like sick. I don't know what was about that game, but it did it.

839
03:55:19,129 --> 03:55:23,049
So I'll be back here tomorrow. We're going to continue to go through the VR catalog.

840
03:55:25,690 --> 03:55:35,159
Why can you shoot the people with the bow and arrow? Why is it like Dark Souls? Why can you

841
03:55:35,239 --> 03:55:47,850
kill NPCs? Oh my god. So tomorrow, I think we're going to open with Space Channel 5.

842
03:55:48,409 --> 03:55:53,690
Then maybe we're going to do some L.A. to more VR case files. And then we're going to do

843
03:55:55,209 --> 03:55:58,170
Sentenced, which is an executioner game. I promise I have eyebrows.

844
03:55:59,129 --> 03:56:06,969
And we'll go from there. But yeah, that's the end of that. Air check. I'll see you guys tomorrow.

845
03:56:07,930 --> 03:56:37,459
How do I look? Sam and Max VR? Is that out? I didn't know that was even out.

846
03:56:43,959 --> 03:56:54,709
I'll get it. Red from Scooby Doo. Well, some of these games were really fun. Boneworks was

847
03:56:54,709 --> 03:57:00,069
cool. It just, I don't know, it was kind of, it wasn't grabbing me. It wasn't grabbing me.

848
03:57:01,180 --> 03:57:04,860
The first like 15 to 20 minutes, I was having like kind of a good time, but it was just,

849
03:57:04,860 --> 03:57:08,459
I don't know, maybe a little too slow for me. Or maybe like I really need to put like a few

850
03:57:08,459 --> 03:57:16,700
hours into it. But I've had a blast. Baseball game was fucking awesome. Time Hacker was

851
03:57:17,420 --> 03:57:24,819
hilarious. VR really is so much fun. But it just, it just annihilates me. I just get so tired.

852
03:57:26,200 --> 03:57:30,440
So that's why we're going tomorrow. Let's take a shower, freshen up. I'll see you guys back here

853
03:57:30,440 --> 03:57:40,149
same time. Four o'clock Pacific. You guys soon? Can't hear me. I'm trying to lean in.

854
03:57:45,479 --> 03:58:04,760
I'll see you tomorrow. Can I get the subs to come up? I can. Look at that. Scammed bet. Well,

855
03:58:04,760 --> 03:58:14,659
I couldn't do it. I didn't do it, obviously, right? I'm really disappointed that the,

856
03:58:15,540 --> 03:58:19,319
I don't know what happened to it, but I'm going to like disconnect all the wires.

857
03:58:21,239 --> 03:58:26,040
That left ear thing is really disappointing. I really hope it's not just a bad cable or something.

858
03:58:27,000 --> 03:58:31,239
Because I have dinged it a few times. I have like punched it a little bit, just like the left side.

859
03:58:31,239 --> 03:58:38,680
You saw me do it. But I don't think that should be enough to kill the left hearing in the headset.

860
03:58:45,510 --> 03:58:47,510
Update. Yeah, I'll do the firmware thing and see if that's a problem.

861
03:58:55,979 --> 03:58:59,340
I've smashed mine into a wall before. Yeah, these things are usually pretty hardy.

862
03:59:01,540 --> 03:59:07,620
My Vive fell off my head flying down into the ground. I have smashed that thing so many times.

863
03:59:08,340 --> 03:59:28,739
But I'll check the cables. I'll get the update. What's your opinion on VR Zorn?

864
03:59:31,739 --> 03:59:36,780
I've never done VR Zorn. I'm terrified to do it. I talked about this in another VR stream,

865
03:59:36,780 --> 03:59:44,889
and I'll make it really, really clear again. VR porn is one of those things where anybody that

866
03:59:44,889 --> 03:59:50,170
you know that could possibly come to your house, or that you possibly are around, you need to make

867
03:59:50,170 --> 03:59:54,569
sure that they're on vacation. Because being inside of this headset and being there,

868
03:59:55,530 --> 03:59:59,610
and you have to be absolutely fucking certain that no one is going to show up.

869
04:00:00,489 --> 04:00:04,569
And I mean, like, if you know that, like, everybody in your household, like, is on vacation,

870
04:00:05,209 --> 04:00:08,649
FaceTime them to make sure that it's proven before you get in.

871
04:00:09,450 --> 04:00:13,590
Like, oh, just checking on this thing. I'm going to FaceTime you like a mom and dad.

872
04:00:13,590 --> 04:00:18,629
Yeah, so how like, show me around Italy. Okay, they're still in fucking Italy. There's no way

873
04:00:18,629 --> 04:00:21,030
they're going to come home. There's no way they're going to see me jerking off in my fucking

874
04:00:21,590 --> 04:00:28,090
VR headset. No possible way, right? It's so vulnerable in there. I wouldn't want to know.

875
04:00:28,090 --> 04:00:38,620
I don't want to do that. Lock the door. No, but why is your door locked? Son, what's the what's

876
04:00:38,620 --> 04:00:44,780
with it? Why was the door locked? Oh, by the way, how are you going to hear that? If somebody tries

877
04:00:44,780 --> 04:00:49,989
to come in your locked door, you're immersed in VR Zorn. How are you going to hear that? They're

878
04:00:49,989 --> 04:00:53,190
going to get like the fire department there because they're scared. They're going to break

879
04:00:53,190 --> 04:00:59,540
your door down and the fire department's going to see you in there. Fucking fully nude in VR. No,

880
04:00:59,540 --> 04:01:09,020
everybody had don't you have to make sure that no one will ever be around. Like he accidentally

881
04:01:09,020 --> 04:01:14,500
locked himself in the door in the room. Are you in there? Hello? Knock, knock, knock. It's where are

882
04:01:14,500 --> 04:01:34,459
you? You're immersed completely. Your headsets are open ear. Well, depends on how loud you're

883
04:01:34,459 --> 04:01:47,180
listening. I'm fucking out of here. I'm sorry. Alright, I'll see you tomorrow. We'll open with

884
04:01:47,180 --> 04:02:57,620
Space Channel 5 tomorrow. See you guys later. Take care of yourselves and goodbye.
