1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:11,980
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with

2
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:14,109
Star!

3
00:00:14,109 --> 00:00:19,949
And we're gonna be playing some Bloody Trapland. If you don't know what Bloody Trapland is, it's a bloody fucking good time, mate.

4
00:00:20,149 --> 00:00:22,149
It's gonna be it's like Super Meat Boy.

5
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:30,519
Let's do the duck in every video. My name is Star. And Boo is in the call. Why are you Jerma too?

6
00:00:30,519 --> 00:00:36,789
I want to be Jerma too. No, you're gonna confuse people. You need to change your name to Star Undercore.

7
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:41,909
You can't do that. It asks you to set your name when you start the game. You seriously picked Jerma too?

8
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:50,130
Yes. Are you a fucking idiot? Deeper into the cave we go. Do you just kill me?

9
00:00:51,289 --> 00:00:57,119
How are you supposed to beat this part?

10
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:04,579
Oh my god. Oh, well you fuck up.

11
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:15,540
What? How did you even get by? Oh! Oh! How did you get by? Fuck, I just-

12
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:25,239
All right, I got this rat. We got this- something tells me this is really gonna suck.

13
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:32,159
This is level three. Fucking god damn it. No!

14
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:43,629
Calm down. Seriously calm down. Go one at a time. Okay. I'm bored. I just want to look at my cat's butt.

15
00:01:43,629 --> 00:01:48,109
How come you're not facing the camera when you bend over? Oh, kitty cat. Yes.

16
00:01:48,109 --> 00:01:55,739
I'm busy like winning the level motherfucker. See I like turn the- I turned to like say something to you and I like died.

17
00:01:55,739 --> 00:02:02,129
Oh my god. I'm not even having fun. That's your own problem. I'm having the lots of fun.

18
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:08,530
I'm having tons of fun. You're gonna have to beat this stage then. I don't think I can do it.

19
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:14,240
You just don't feel like playing anymore. You just seriously gonna give up like that? Yeah.

20
00:02:14,439 --> 00:02:18,180
I'm just gonna be here to annoy you and see if I can jump on your head or anything.

21
00:02:21,979 --> 00:02:26,680
Wow, is this the boss fight? What's the first boss fight? I don't think there's any bosses.

22
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:40,840
There's no- if you- you really need to fuck off right now. Need a clip? Need a clip? Need a clip?

23
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:56,360
What? Oh, I thought we started on the left. What?

24
00:02:57,879 --> 00:02:59,879
What just happened?

25
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:07,599
We got air shot. Why is there friendly fire like that? This makes it so much more difficult to do anything.

26
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:14,219
This game takes way too much concentration. I just want to play something nice like Rest In Peace Department.

27
00:03:14,419 --> 00:03:17,139
Why won't you ever play Rest In Peace Department with me?

28
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:24,800
Funny thing is this video is gonna be going up before you put that one up so that joke will make sense.

29
00:03:28,069 --> 00:03:39,250
Shit. Oh my god. No. No, I don't even know- I don't know what to do. I'm so- I don't know. I don't know. Fuck!

30
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:53,949
I don't see you getting that far. Look where I am. I'm up here. You go first because seriously, this is just getting stupid.

31
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:04,879
I'm trying to beat it.

32
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,520
You're an idiot, you know that.

33
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:19,910
Well, look at you. You did the same thing I did. Oh, good joke. Here, did you joke? Need a joke? Oh, shit.

34
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:21,910
I was gonna shit talk.

35
00:04:24,439 --> 00:04:34,519
I'm kind of confused as to do right here. Well, how do you get over that? Oh, oh, okay. Do it. Do it up.

36
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:38,139
You can do this.

37
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:53,279
Nice. I wouldn't like this game if we weren't furries. How did you just seriously do-

38
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:55,279
You would kill me, asshole!

39
00:05:00,579 --> 00:05:04,500
I'm sorry. You had a thing going there and I just fucked it all up.

40
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:16,000
I triggered it. Will you go? I triggered the fist. Go!

41
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:21,009
I just triggered the fist right there and you didn't even do- you didn't do anything.

42
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:26,639
You figure you're just gonna sit there and keep doing the crouch. Oh my goodness.

43
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:31,540
I'm making progress.

44
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:34,800
Oh, yeah? How do you like that?

45
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,629
Trigger the fist again.

46
00:05:36,629 --> 00:05:39,990
No, you're not gonna do anything. If I trigger the fist again, you're not gonna do anything. You're just gonna stand there.

47
00:05:40,949 --> 00:05:46,819
Yeah, I triggered it. Nice. Can we just sit back and let me do it? No.

48
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:51,620
Yes. Just sit back and just enjoy this. Enjoy this presentation of greatness.

49
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:00,560
Shit. That was- that was not planned. Good presentation.

50
00:06:02,449 --> 00:06:09,410
Is this strike two? Strike two? Strike two? See that swirly thing? That never happened before. Strike three.

51
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:12,689
That never happened before. You're out. You're out. No. Here's the preview.

52
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:16,209
Can we edit around and just do it like I did at first try?

53
00:06:17,189 --> 00:06:20,389
All right. Yeah. Can we just pretend like this is the first time I'm going in?

54
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:26,959
Yeah, let's pretend this is the first time you went in. Yeah, all this blood you see is like we just got to this stage.

55
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:29,199
Yeah, somebody- some like real- some scrub

56
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,839
was here before us and died like 300 times at this stage. It wasn't us.

57
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:46,100
Oh, there's even more to this bullshit. You better pull this through because there's no way I'm doing that. God damn, that thing is just

58
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:51,480
right in my ass. There's a pattern. There's a pattern. There's like an actual pattern to this.

59
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,920
I'm just trying to do it- I'm trying to do it ASAP Rocky.

60
00:06:58,949 --> 00:07:05,750
Oh boy. No. What? I did like the lightest jump you could do there.

61
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:18,680
Whoa. Whoa, dude. Whoa. Okay. Whoa.

62
00:07:33,189 --> 00:07:37,720
Yeah, how long do we have to play this so you can like have a video?

63
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:44,160
How long is this gonna keep going on? Like I don't think you've had any fun.

64
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,480
You do realize I'm putting that part in.

65
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:54,839
You do realize. Yeah, I know that's like how you conclude your video. Yeah. Oh.

66
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:03,990
What the hell is wrong with you?
