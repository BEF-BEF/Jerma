1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:13,689
Hey, good afternoon. Hi, everybody. How's your day gone so far? Mine's good, I'm a little heavy.

2
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:23,129
Just a little. That probably needs some explanation. In fact, it feels like I'm a softball,

3
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:32,810
like in my stomach right now. Just a little heavy, you know, a little bloated, but it's okay. I've got

4
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:47,240
some nice tea here. It's not tea, it's coffee. The laxatives haven't kicked in yet. Well, that's the

5
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:55,799
thing. They have, they have very much so. It's been, it's been very fun, but they're not even,

6
00:00:55,799 --> 00:01:00,920
okay, I don't want to get into this. It's not like what you think when you think of that word.

7
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:08,260
Trust me, it's not what you think it is. There's like a, there's comedy, you know, comedy like

8
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:17,769
laxative. No, that's not, it's not what's happening. If you've seen any movie from like 1992 to like

9
00:01:17,769 --> 00:01:32,659
1998, there was a, it's not like that. I mean, some of them could be,

10
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:49,079
but this one isn't. I literally just joined. Anyways, that's a good way to start this stream.

11
00:01:49,959 --> 00:01:57,159
Why don't we bring in the two special guests? It's Star and Ashley. I think I said that before

12
00:01:57,239 --> 00:02:02,150
muting, unmuting. I said Star and Ashley. Here they are.

13
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:19,939
Hey, Ashley. I muted at the wrong time. I unmuted at the wrong time. But yeah, we're going to do

14
00:02:19,939 --> 00:02:40,550
Trine, Trine 4. Wait, what? I thought, I thought this is three people. What? How does that, doesn't

15
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:52,039
it break the game? And then once you get to six, once you get to Trine 6, it's 3 v 3.

16
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:58,840
No, there's not that many people in the world. Trine like six is just like a 3 v 3,

17
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:03,080
it's like Dota game. Yeah. And the developers are pissed off about it because they want to make it,

18
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,639
but they have to make Trine 5 first so that the joke works.

19
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:16,439
So I remember we did this, we did a video on this. Yeah. Finally, I got to be one of Steve's videos.

20
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:20,280
That is one of the most popular videos you and I have ever done together.

21
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:24,840
Yeah. I was just saying before this, how recently like today I walked into a McDonald's and they

22
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:29,319
were showing it on the screen. Yeah. I couldn't believe it. Yeah. It's ridiculous. I know.

23
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:35,080
That's weird because I was at, I was at a Burger King two days ago and they was showing this video

24
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:42,650
too. Really? Yeah. That's his joke. He just took that right from him. What the fuck? You can't do

25
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:49,370
that. Steve, you can't let him do that. Okay. Mine wasn't a joke. Is yours a joke? Or did yours

26
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:55,610
also really happen? Just like, just steal your joke in front of you. Yeah. Yeah. That's bad.

27
00:03:55,610 --> 00:04:00,969
That's, that's just how we do it. Come on. Come on, Rowdy. Cut it out. Are we starting the game, Rowdy?

28
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:08,389
Yeah, I'm ready. I'm ready. Okay. Okay. And by the way, my name is KettleCorn. Call me KettleCorn.

29
00:04:08,389 --> 00:04:13,990
What do you mean KettleCorn? My name is Frozen Buttwagon. Once upon a time, Amadeus the wizard

30
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:22,360
was waking up in a cottage. I got a sweet spot for like wizard voices. Attending a wizard.

31
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:29,819
My volume's too low. What if I hit escape button? And that morning, he decided a trip to the mail

32
00:04:29,819 --> 00:04:36,459
box. He has flashes on his shelf. Even if this box was located at a very inconvenient distance,

33
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:48,089
time to find that mailbox. Wait, who does? Okay. No, I don't want W-A-S-D. Why are we all wizards?

34
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:58,540
I don't have a hat. Why do I get a hat? My control was plugged in. Why did they make me the pink one?

35
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:02,379
This is the tutorial. You remember? You got to play each hero one at a time.

36
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:07,019
Now we're all wizards. Remember when we were on the beach? And I, cause I know,

37
00:05:07,019 --> 00:05:14,439
cause I just saw this from the McDonald's. Wait, what? Hold left and okay. I'm ready. Right.

38
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:22,519
So get on the cube. Do I have to do these on screen to get them off the screen without A and D?

39
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:26,600
Actually, we could just walk out the door, but we have to walk out the door.

40
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:34,120
What? Oh, which one? Oh, I'm purple. Dude, I got the Twitch. I got the Twitch skin.

41
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:42,870
I think it actually is zoom in. No, it's not. Is it zoom in? Oh, there is a zoom. I'm zooming.

42
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:51,379
Is there, how do you zoom? Look at my shoulder. Hey Rowdy. What's up? How are you? Oh, I got a thing.

43
00:05:51,379 --> 00:05:54,740
Okay. That's how you do that. They, they nerfed the wizard. I was saying,

44
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:58,259
because normally you make, you draw a square and the square appears there,

45
00:05:58,259 --> 00:06:02,259
but now it's always over your head. And also if you jump on your own square,

46
00:06:02,259 --> 00:06:06,819
then you can't manipulate your own square for a duration after touching your square. You guys are,

47
00:06:07,699 --> 00:06:13,060
you guys are training, aren't you? Yeah. All right. So A is jump. I've gotten that far.

48
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:21,060
No, it's space bar. What? I have a controller. I have a controller. I don't care.

49
00:06:21,939 --> 00:06:31,579
Yeah. A-W-A-S-A jump. Break them. Oh, there's instructions. Cool. He has to do this every time

50
00:06:31,579 --> 00:06:35,019
he leaves his home. That tree just keeps growing. What about the, what about the secret up there?

51
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:40,949
You got to smash it. Yeah. Nice. So you get what? Three of these in a level or something?

52
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:48,250
Do we all, I think we all have to use our power at the same time. No, one person should be able

53
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:52,649
to do this. Come on. If you weren't touching it, I think you could just lift it. Well, somebody put

54
00:06:53,209 --> 00:07:04,920
up. Oh, why is there a snowball in here? Oh, we're losing them. We're losing them.

55
00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:12,839
Run. Hurry. Oh, get up. Highlight levitation objects and then switch targets. Okay. So if you,

56
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:18,439
I get it. I'm trying to give you my box, but it doesn't fit through.

57
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:21,959
All right. Somebody left that and stick it in the way like the traffic game. Good work.

58
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:28,310
Oh, here. Here's the, here's the secret technique.

59
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:40,459
Get off. No, you guys are doing the centipede from Super Mario Brothers to me. Get this out of here.

60
00:07:42,439 --> 00:07:47,240
Thank you. I'm so good at balancing snow. Wow. This doesn't look like it should be possible.

61
00:07:48,279 --> 00:07:53,910
When is it going to come to life?

62
00:07:53,910 --> 00:08:02,250
It's like start screaming. Yeah, I know. It's a very, it's a very nice looking game.

63
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:08,069
Well, I turned my graphics down all the way. So it looks like I'm a little weird.

64
00:08:08,709 --> 00:08:14,889
You can do it, honey. So we're going to have to go through each chapter as the,

65
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:18,970
the first level is going to be each character. Yeah. It makes sense.

66
00:08:19,689 --> 00:08:27,350
Okay. You can rotate. Oh, all right. That's cool. I'm the wizard. I've always been the wizard and

67
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:32,309
I'll continue. Yeah, I got it. We have a side role. If you put weight on something,

68
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:39,269
it falls. Yeah. They nerf the wizards. But if you go fast, it doesn't matter.

69
00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:50,840
There you go. I mean, I think we need one of those. How did you get it? What though? I guess I think

70
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:58,700
we're supposed to use that here. Nah, but it's okay. Again, I stress this is his trip to his

71
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:04,220
mailbox every day. All right. This is a puzzle. Everyone worked together with our brains.

72
00:09:09,909 --> 00:09:17,299
Stick that up. Wait, did you already leave? Yeah. Are we supposed to be doing puzzles together? You

73
00:09:17,299 --> 00:09:24,100
just like jumping. There wasn't a puzzle. You just make a box and climb. You come up here, you make

74
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:47,049
a box puzzle. I thought this is. Yeah, I know. Okay. Oh, we can't. Oh, hold on. Did I just like

75
00:09:47,049 --> 00:09:56,330
push you off the level? I'm Donkey Kong here. Hold the box still so I can jump on it. Thank you.

76
00:09:56,330 --> 00:10:01,690
Did you lose your hat? I never had a hat. What? We're the same guy. We're the same guy.

77
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:15,379
Conjure a box. Um, I think we should probably just all make a box and all use it together.

78
00:10:16,179 --> 00:10:25,720
Same. Secrets. Secrets. Get the box. They didn't think he would get those secrets.

79
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:35,659
Oh, I don't do it. No, no, please. Let me do it. Please. Please. Okay. So the box goes. Okay.

80
00:10:36,379 --> 00:10:38,779
Just do it. Just do it. I know you can do this. Just put it in there.

81
00:10:40,809 --> 00:10:47,100
I figured it out. Wow. You didn't. You didn't fucking figure it out. I figured it out.

82
00:10:53,539 --> 00:11:03,779
Oh, is it a launcher? I think it's a launcher. I think it's a weir. Is it a weir?

83
00:11:08,179 --> 00:11:17,799
Why is that snow glowing? Why is that snow glowing? Can you break it? I can't like scrape it off

84
00:11:17,799 --> 00:11:22,840
like an ice scraper. Um, all right. We'll see. All right. Jump on this and then yeah.

85
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:31,110
Do we need weight over here? As low as I can put it. All right. Ready?

86
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:42,679
Nice. Now I have to do this. Wow. Look at us. We are very athletic. Secrets over here.

87
00:11:46,679 --> 00:12:01,289
Kill it. Kill it. Hey. Wow. Wow. Go forward. What if an alien just like flew their spaceship next to

88
00:12:01,289 --> 00:12:08,389
your window and just leaned over to their friend in the cockpit and just said, kill it. Wow. Oh,

89
00:12:08,389 --> 00:12:15,529
my God. You guys. Come on, guys. I thought you were going to like lift me up over to the ledge,

90
00:12:15,529 --> 00:12:24,090
but I was wrong. Oh, no. What? Why? I don't know. Oh, it's a snake. Attach. Attach. Yeah.

91
00:12:26,409 --> 00:12:29,210
I have to. Come on, rowdy.

92
00:12:29,529 --> 00:12:37,750
Located. So wait, so I'm going to grab this thing. Yeah. You got to hook it over the woods.

93
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:44,470
All right. So somebody that has to stick it there. How do I hook it? She's blocking you.

94
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:48,230
I can't hook it. You're just going to have to run. I can't move this thing back. Hold on.

95
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:52,470
I got to like hook it right here, right? It's not hooking.

96
00:12:54,149 --> 00:12:59,179
Okay. Well, I'm just going to do this. Just stay there. Okay. It's hooking.

97
00:13:01,159 --> 00:13:15,029
Just jump over it. Wait, I got you. I got you. This is a wire rowdy.

98
00:13:20,309 --> 00:13:30,149
The glowy snow is sticky. Nice. Well, he does that every time I have to go to my mailbox.

99
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:40,379
Somebody said, oh, great. Another pretending to mess up puzzle stream. We're like speed running

100
00:13:40,379 --> 00:13:45,340
this level. We haven't even attempted to do a puzzle. Look at how fast we're going.

101
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:53,529
There hasn't even been an attempt. You have three wizards. We're kind of too powerful.

102
00:13:53,529 --> 00:14:06,230
Oops. Did I get it? Got it. I did the stir thing. Wow. Jump on the box. I already beat this level

103
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:13,659
in my mind. Now you did. You did. There's something down there. There's two of us down here.

104
00:14:14,919 --> 00:14:17,879
Get up here. I'm getting boxed in. Here. Take it.

105
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:30,059
Ooh, nice. Thank you, Taylor Swift. I'm bringing it. I'm bringing it. You bring it. We got our mail.

106
00:14:30,059 --> 00:14:34,460
Oh, I got my mail. What's it say? Fucking evicted.

107
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:37,899
How far it is.

108
00:14:41,899 --> 00:14:45,879
Oh, Disneyland. Two years ago.

109
00:14:51,419 --> 00:14:57,590
Academy. He has vanished under mysterious and troublesome circumstances.

110
00:15:03,289 --> 00:15:29,509
And Lord, I am going to learn magic. Constant conflict. Yeah. Turn himself into a snail.

111
00:15:32,419 --> 00:15:35,299
A snail. He's missing, but he's actually like under that table.

112
00:15:36,259 --> 00:15:38,580
Oh, that's actually pretty good.

113
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:41,779
Caught a giant quest.

114
00:15:56,419 --> 00:15:59,529
All right. I remember this guy.

115
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:14,620
You get to wear his hat in TF2. I don't even know what you just said.

116
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:24,379
What did you say? You get to wear his hat in TF2. Wait, you actually do? Yeah. You buy,

117
00:16:24,379 --> 00:16:30,139
try and you get his hat. Wow. That's where every single steam release had a TF2 hat tie in.

118
00:16:30,779 --> 00:16:34,379
Whatever happened to that? You can ride pumpkins. Why are you guys pushing me?

119
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:41,240
A speedrun. Wee. What? Oh, it's bouncing. No, it's not a speedrun. We have to pretend to mess up

120
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:58,059
puzzles. No, we're not. We're perfect. You died in a pumpkin accident. Oh, shit. Wait, can we all

121
00:16:58,059 --> 00:17:05,019
smash? What? All I've wanted is to smash. Wait, we didn't get the thing. You didn't get the thing.

122
00:17:05,019 --> 00:17:08,940
What thing? Do you really want to get the things in the tutorial? Who cares? Yeah,

123
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:17,960
can we all smash? Whoa. Stomp on that. Wait. Oh, you jump and there's a Yoshi stomp.

124
00:17:21,029 --> 00:17:34,789
Do you remember this now? Yes. What? I need a block. You can't make a block. You got to smash.

125
00:17:34,789 --> 00:17:41,720
Well, where's the wizard? What? I need to be launched.

126
00:17:44,309 --> 00:17:50,940
Knock that. There we go. Knock that wood over here. I'm making it up now.

127
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:57,779
I need this thing to launch me. Now you have to get launched. No, not me.

128
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:11,880
No double bouncing. There you go. Okay. The secret was to do nothing. How do we get those?

129
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:19,980
Oh, that's out. All right, go. I get them. What about over here? Hey, what about over there?

130
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:27,380
No. Is there a sprint? You have to unlock it. You have to beat the game once.

131
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:40,019
No, you don't. That'd be very strange if that were true. Okay. My controller unplugged.

132
00:18:40,019 --> 00:18:46,119
He's trying to create stream content. He's like already bored of the game.

133
00:18:48,549 --> 00:19:02,789
Break the ceiling. Break the ceiling. Yeah. What? This game is cute. It's good. He hates streaming.

134
00:19:03,509 --> 00:19:11,059
That's like my, that's like my new favorite thing. People will just write,

135
00:19:11,059 --> 00:19:20,220
he hates streaming and then like a sad face. Whoa. Star, can you give us,

136
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:24,059
can you give us regular people a second to even know what the fucking thing does?

137
00:19:24,859 --> 00:19:31,259
Okay. Oh, you, okay, you bounce light. That's cool. Oh, let's play. We could,

138
00:19:31,259 --> 00:19:35,019
we could all bounce it. I can bounce it to you and then you can bounce it back to me and then

139
00:19:35,019 --> 00:19:43,160
then we can make the, the triune. Oh, no, let's do it right now. Come on. You can get it.

140
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:50,150
What if I jumped? We have to like burn it or something. How do we burn that?

141
00:19:54,619 --> 00:19:58,940
What about the green stuff? Oh, no, let's see. We know. Yeah. The green stuff behind it.

142
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:04,220
Shoot the beam at me. We got it. We got a double beam. That's no excuse for your evil doing.

143
00:20:04,299 --> 00:20:08,890
It's working. All right. I'm aiming at you. Oh, look at that.

144
00:20:09,769 --> 00:20:25,880
There we go. One for each of us. Nice. What are these jellies even doing? Third wheel,

145
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:37,509
trine third wheel. What? Oh, you're talking about, you're talking about me. We're getting it.

146
00:20:38,069 --> 00:20:50,420
We can make a tower. Oh, my fuck. How am I supposed to drop the thing for me? Hey,

147
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:59,910
drop the thing for me. Yes. So disrespectful. Hey, we're going to get this. Projectile is

148
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:13,819
going to be blocked as well. Nice. Stop. Stop. Hey, he's trying to do this stream content.

149
00:21:13,819 --> 00:21:22,220
All right. I'll go. He's already bored in the game. No, it's funny when I do it.

150
00:21:22,299 --> 00:21:33,160
Yeah. That's how it always works. And I remain. Okay. I'll do this way. How did I die up here?

151
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:37,000
Killed you accidentally. I don't know. I'll do it back. All right. I'll go forward.

152
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:49,859
Okay. Didn't know. We didn't know. Oh, no. No, you were in front.

153
00:21:50,740 --> 00:22:00,329
She's not. All right. I'll go forward. Wait. You have to wait. Okay. Whoever is. Wait. No, stop.

154
00:22:01,289 --> 00:22:11,420
Whoever is in front. I'm going to go forward. Go. All right. Somebody get across. You did it.

155
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:24,420
All right. I'll go up. No. I can't. If I put this down, I die.

156
00:22:24,819 --> 00:22:37,029
All right. We have to. No, no. You have to bounce it. No, you got it. You have to bounce it this way.

157
00:22:37,029 --> 00:22:44,579
Shoot one at me. All right. I don't think you can. I can't. No, it won't reach from there.

158
00:22:45,299 --> 00:22:56,170
This one's tricky. Just I'll die. Who cares? I'm good. Oh, he took it for the team. Let's go.

159
00:22:56,650 --> 00:23:11,720
Hey, I'm back. Oh, no. Skeleton King. Is it a boss? Do they have bosses? Yeah. Yeah. Remember

160
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:23,690
those dragons? Do you remember this guy that we're fighting right now? I don't. Oh, yeah.

161
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:26,970
Give him a light beam. Oh, wait. I didn't need to hit his. You have to hit his like swords.

162
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:32,069
You can't stand light, sir. Wow. It's the same way you could defeat me.

163
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:46,380
All right. How do we break that? Oh, okay. That's how. He's in so much pain.

164
00:23:51,779 --> 00:24:00,200
All right. I'll keep him there. You hit his back. All right. We got to break the thing up here.

165
00:24:06,859 --> 00:24:11,339
I think we have to. I have to bounce. All right. We have to do like a three or four person bounce

166
00:24:11,339 --> 00:24:25,720
thing here. How am I the only one that jumped on that? All right. Here we go. Oh, it'd be easier

167
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:34,759
to do that from that side because then you just shoot it up. There we go. Got to do it again.

168
00:24:36,599 --> 00:24:59,880
No, you don't. All right. Kill. I have a note too. Oh, okay. So I had to, as the wizard,

169
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:04,519
destroy three trees and like a friend of goat to get my mail and he just gets it brought to him.

170
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:10,599
How long? Okay. So this is trying four. How many years have gone by since trying one?

171
00:25:12,519 --> 00:25:17,640
I don't know. Use Google. We have an unfortunate case of a missing. We have a trying story.

172
00:25:21,799 --> 00:25:29,829
2009. That's when the game came out. Not how long has passed in the game universe.

173
00:25:29,829 --> 00:25:34,309
Oh, in the game universe. Yes, that's what I'm saying. I thought you were talking about like

174
00:25:34,309 --> 00:25:39,509
when did they make that? No. Are you trying to figure out if the characters are still like

175
00:25:39,509 --> 00:25:44,710
bangable or what? Yeah, it'd be really funny if they switched to the archer and she was like in

176
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:52,519
a grave. Oh, and what happened to our noble archer? Oh, oh, they got to find another guy.

177
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,599
Oh, no, it's the archer section.

178
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:08,940
Why did you do that? Skip.

179
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:17,900
Oh, she's the assassin's creed. Yeah. I was going to say, is that, is that a tie-in or is it just

180
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:28,140
what? It's a tie-in. Is it actually? Yeah. Yeah, the makers of this game are friends with the

181
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:33,579
assassin's creed. Are they? The prince guy that we have to stop is a templar. It's the whole thing.

182
00:26:34,299 --> 00:26:41,500
Wait, what do I do? This character is kind of fun. This is your character. So this is my character.

183
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:44,779
This is your character. That's why I liked it. Okay.

184
00:26:44,779 --> 00:26:57,420
Uh-huh. Bath beads? No, they're definitely bath beads. Oh yeah, you have the grapple hook too.

185
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:04,250
That's why this makes this character the hardest. So why do I have to have the hardest character?

186
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:08,890
It's not the hardest. Because you're the best. I make a box and you grapple to the box and then

187
00:27:08,890 --> 00:27:14,490
I throw you into a pit. Don't you remember? Oh, now it's coming back to me. Yes, I do.

188
00:27:17,579 --> 00:27:25,910
Are we capturing the objective? I don't know. Yes, you have to capture it. Somebody has to

189
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:40,420
stand there long enough to open the door. Okay. Okay. Bye. You gotta let him learn.

190
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:46,660
This is his only chance. He's never gonna. Let Rowdy do it. Wait, are you guys talking about me?

191
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:53,539
Yeah. Let Rowdy do it. Your little brother's gotta learn. I'm like four years older than you.

192
00:27:53,539 --> 00:28:07,369
Oh, you got them both at a double.

193
00:28:19,109 --> 00:28:21,430
All right. But seriously though, like, you know, I'm going to get these.

194
00:28:23,269 --> 00:28:26,630
I'm making you do it. You do all the grunt work. We'll keep doing the level.

195
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:41,430
Somebody has to pull this. I guess I'll do it. Yeah, you do it. Enjoy your date guys. I'll

196
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:47,930
just like do all this stuff. Bye. Let's go make out. Oh, hold on. We got us Rowdy. You have to

197
00:28:47,930 --> 00:28:59,380
help me. Here we go. All right. We need to look at this highlight. You can highlight targets.

198
00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:08,299
Okay. So pull that. You pull it and then you attach it to this. So it stays here.

199
00:29:09,339 --> 00:29:13,579
Like, so you got to pull it forward and then, then put it on the other thing. Oh,

200
00:29:13,579 --> 00:29:22,970
but the camera scrolls. There we go. Yes. Oh, come on Rowdy. Oh, you can walk on it.

201
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:31,059
Oh, come on Rowdy. Well, you guys all ran away. Uh, can I, can I just do in the dessert menu?

202
00:29:37,539 --> 00:29:43,740
Why is my rope growing? Yeah.

203
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:52,539
I just realized what you're doing. Please don't bully.

204
00:29:55,460 --> 00:30:00,819
You guys are so bad at this game. I'm missing dinner. We're doing it so fast though.

205
00:30:00,819 --> 00:30:06,339
How can you call this bad? It wasn't me. It wasn't me. It wasn't me that said that.

206
00:30:07,619 --> 00:30:13,619
Oh, your chat. I'm getting, it's been long enough to make references to Spider-Man movies.

207
00:30:14,339 --> 00:30:20,500
Uh, yeah. There's another room over here with a mystery box guys.

208
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:29,589
Mystery box guys. There's a mystery box over here. Whoa. Nice shot. No Rowdy.

209
00:30:35,019 --> 00:30:39,609
Oh, and the, and the, he went in the tank. Oh dude, that happened to me.

210
00:30:42,809 --> 00:30:47,769
I can relate to that stuffed animal. All right. So now I'm going to do, uh,

211
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:54,170
ropes of bridges too. So go, go on. Yeah. I think we're doing one at a time and then I

212
00:30:54,170 --> 00:31:01,529
got to capture the flag. Oh wait, hold on a second. I can like, that's kind of cool.

213
00:31:01,529 --> 00:31:11,019
Well, no, now, now I detach it. Okay. He's learning. Yeah, that's cool. Let's go.

214
00:31:18,759 --> 00:31:28,009
All right. Now attach that. Attach that to that. Okay. Now I can let go of this.

215
00:31:28,089 --> 00:31:36,630
Wait, no, you can't. No, you can't. It's bridge. I, yep. Okay. Oh, now you can let go of it and

216
00:31:36,630 --> 00:32:00,009
climb up. You gotta be quick. Balloons. Nope. Drop down B. That's a huge cat. Yeah.

217
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:11,880
Should we ring the bell? You have to, so that the hunchback comes out.

218
00:32:12,759 --> 00:32:23,900
All right. We'll open the thing. All right. We did it. I don't know how we did this. Take it.

219
00:32:28,009 --> 00:32:50,039
Oh, we were, we're a mercenary thing. Oh yeah. Jerma is the bad guy. That was weird. Get it.

220
00:32:52,599 --> 00:32:59,640
I get to be the first. I thought it was the other guy. I'm the one that's disturbed about them.

221
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:07,779
It was just the one without a hat. Maybe the masquerade can show you extremely hapless. Like a

222
00:33:08,579 --> 00:33:13,539
new TM two player. No. All right. So then attaching this. Yeah. I think you got to wrap

223
00:33:13,539 --> 00:33:20,500
it all the way around. Do I? I can't go that far. How did you get up there? I just jumped up. No.

224
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:33,849
Okay. Then. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I was already attached to it. Oh, there's one on the floor.

225
00:33:33,930 --> 00:33:44,710
Yeah. It's this one here, but why can't, don't unattach, unattach. Okay. Everybody

226
00:33:44,710 --> 00:33:52,309
unattach everything. Please stop. Stop. I'm not moving. I was about to ask who's rowdy.

227
00:34:01,099 --> 00:34:06,779
Don't do anything. Let's start to it. Let's go. Hey, are you Brad?

228
00:34:07,259 --> 00:34:19,659
It's an old meme. All right. So if you go, I don't think that's what we do. I think

229
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:28,420
unless one person, I think one person just do it and then there's a lever on the other side.

230
00:34:29,219 --> 00:34:34,170
There is a lever on the other side. So I think somebody just runs it. Just go. Oh, and then you

231
00:34:34,170 --> 00:34:43,380
can. Yep. I'm trying. Oh, you make the bridge. Yeah. Somebody said to make bridge. That makes

232
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:53,500
sense. Yeah, we were overthinking that. We already have 72 drops of virgin blood.

233
00:34:55,610 --> 00:35:00,969
I just was going to say it was like simple syrup and red food coloring, but you fucking psycho.

234
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:12,809
While she was on her way to the masquerade, Zoya happened upon a place that brought back the town's

235
00:35:12,809 --> 00:35:21,349
orphanage. 72 drops of germ of blood. What's your blood doing all over the trine world?

236
00:35:22,869 --> 00:35:34,380
That person's also fucking psycho. Oh, she's sold the paintings so that she could fund the orphanage.

237
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:55,539
Bees. There's bees everywhere. Bees. That's funny for like one second when he then he stopped doing

238
00:35:55,539 --> 00:36:02,469
the thing that was bees everywhere. No shadows. Clearly got stung. It was just a nightmare.

239
00:36:18,949 --> 00:36:24,550
Oh, he's dead. He killed Disney. What happened?

240
00:36:34,599 --> 00:36:40,679
Many letters sent by the master wizardess directed our three heroes to a rocky and

241
00:36:41,639 --> 00:36:42,280
wind-beaten heath.

242
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:51,929
Whoops. He's talking to MLC's stealth. What? Beginning of level. Go.

243
00:36:54,900 --> 00:37:02,420
Many letters sent by the master wizardess directed our three heroes to a rocky and wind-beaten heath.

244
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:08,659
Oh, it's for. Yeah. I thought it was. That got confused. So do we get to pick our characters

245
00:37:08,659 --> 00:37:14,019
or is this just who's logged in first? At last, the enchanted heroes of trine

246
00:37:14,659 --> 00:37:23,579
together again. Zoya, if you've given up your Oh, we're officially our role. We are roles.

247
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:30,780
Now we have to role play. Can you stand on my box when I hold my box?

248
00:37:31,579 --> 00:37:34,059
Oh, no, they nerfed the wizard. Sorry.

249
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:43,099
No, stop. I was practicing. Now I know where I head swirl or you. You see how many head flips

250
00:37:43,099 --> 00:37:50,300
you can do when you drop it. Two is it's very hard. Yeah. See me when you get 100 super jumps, buddy.

251
00:37:51,179 --> 00:37:55,260
That's not that impressive. That's the end game. I don't want to rush you guys there.

252
00:37:56,219 --> 00:38:09,019
Oh, nice job, Rowdy. Yeah. Thanks. You coming, Rowdy? Oh, man. Nice slam. Wow. Nice. Oh, dead.

253
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:23,670
I can get that. Everyone's doing so well right now. I know. Really? I'm really good. Really

254
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:27,989
good. I can't tell if you're trying to kill me because I think he's trying to find muted so that

255
00:38:27,989 --> 00:38:32,949
he could tell people. Am I muted? I was unmuted. How long have I been muted for? Probably like an

256
00:38:32,949 --> 00:38:40,550
hour. Hey, we missed blood. Everyone's freaking out. Oh, we didn't miss. Yeah, we did right here.

257
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:48,550
Well, we haven't gone yet. Oh, hold on. We need my smash. You got to break it. Yeah. Wait, wait,

258
00:38:48,550 --> 00:38:56,199
this with you. This upgrade points. Yeah, you can. Yeah, you can. What the heck? Oh, my God.

259
00:38:56,199 --> 00:39:07,019
There's a skill tree. Oh, there's always been skill trees. Starting skill. Next upgrade. Hey,

260
00:39:07,019 --> 00:39:13,880
Ashley, I have officially replaced you. Oh, yeah. My box is as good as you are.

261
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:24,460
Okay, greater damage to enemies or a quick roll. Oh, now I'm more annoying.

262
00:39:27,019 --> 00:39:37,219
How do I do it? There it is. That's my new ability. It's Sonic the Hedgehog over here.

263
00:39:37,219 --> 00:39:43,349
Actually, you go pretty far too. You guys need that? Do you guys need a bridge? Let me know when

264
00:39:43,349 --> 00:39:49,190
you need a bridge. I'll be useful. Rowdy touched it. Despite not needing it, Rowdy really made

265
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:54,630
her to drop it on you. What? I didn't do anything. When someone touches it, it falls.

266
00:39:57,059 --> 00:40:04,059
But what are you going to do? I'm going to do the same thing. Excellent work, everybody. We need a

267
00:40:04,059 --> 00:40:17,079
box. But hold on a minute here. Secret, secret. Yeah. Can you lift that box up a little? You can't

268
00:40:17,079 --> 00:40:23,559
if you're on it. Oh, wait. Yeah. Oh, the whole teamwork, dude. Wow, look at this. Look at this.

269
00:40:23,559 --> 00:40:37,369
It's a super. Oh, my God. That's a super. Shoot it. Oh, super. Wow. This game's got fun.

270
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:48,840
Oh, I think you might have to get it to touch this. This thing down here. Do we have to swap

271
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:55,800
characters? No, there's no swapping allowed. We get no swapping allowed, no matter what. I thought

272
00:40:56,440 --> 00:41:01,400
I mean, it is allowed, but both packed. OK. No swapping allowed. Well, what do you want to do

273
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:17,289
here then? I don't know. I don't know. You should be able to do everything with only one person.

274
00:41:17,289 --> 00:41:24,900
OK. Oh, no. What about this big lever up here? Yeah. No, there has to be something with this

275
00:41:27,139 --> 00:41:36,389
mechanism up here. Yeah. No, maybe that drops the mechanism. Maybe when you actually shine

276
00:41:36,389 --> 00:41:47,139
the light in there. Oh, I might. Yeah. All right. What are you? What? Wait, wait. Hold on. What if

277
00:41:47,139 --> 00:41:51,989
you stand on the box like put the box here? Can you like stand and bounce it?

278
00:41:58,179 --> 00:42:17,059
There you go. Like, can you do it from there? No. Hmm. Hmm. That's not how light works.

279
00:42:17,139 --> 00:42:18,340
We got like a physicist.

280
00:42:22,659 --> 00:42:28,659
What if you jumped down and aimed like as you fell? No, that's still.

281
00:42:30,099 --> 00:42:38,619
Whoa, wait a minute. What if you did this? Hmm. What? Hmm. Stand on my thing. It's not

282
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:48,139
that I can't. I can't reflect it backwards. What if I do it the other way? Can I attach

283
00:42:48,139 --> 00:42:55,659
another way? Wait a minute. Hmm. Oh, hold on. Let me let me let me move you down a little.

284
00:42:59,449 --> 00:43:06,469
Hmm. If you were standing right above it, wouldn't you get it? Maybe. Right there. Right

285
00:43:06,469 --> 00:43:22,179
right around there somewhere. There's an angle. Oh, hold on. I don't think there is. Remove box.

286
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:36,820
Get rid of the box. Right. Now do it. No, still wants to go that that way. Damn it. Hold on. What

287
00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:42,739
if I go here? Does it reflect off of the metal above you? Oh, it's so close. Hold on. Let me let

288
00:43:42,739 --> 00:43:55,159
me. Can you like skate on it from here? What? Look at that. Come on. That should count, game.

289
00:43:55,159 --> 00:44:06,820
Oh, it briefly is counting. I see it like lighting up. It's so close. Oh, and we can't stand up there.

290
00:44:07,699 --> 00:44:15,110
Oh, damn it. That's some shit. We did it. How are you supposed to do that? Nice work.

291
00:44:18,090 --> 00:44:27,900
Uh, I need to like. Oh, sorry. I guess I just ride this.

292
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:35,780
Come on, Rowdy. Um, I have to do it. I can only get there by riding this.

293
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:44,090
Come on, Rowdy. Oh, wait. It's okay. It's a bridge. Whoopsie. We both jumped over.

294
00:44:44,090 --> 00:44:50,309
Right. It's a bridge. Okay. You're right. Sorry about that. Sorry. I thought I don't know why I

295
00:44:50,309 --> 00:45:01,610
thought that was in the same plane. Wait, what's up here? Secret? Potentially? No. I already went

296
00:45:01,610 --> 00:45:14,920
over there. Oh, we have another light thing to do. Maybe this one will be not as ridiculous as the

297
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:24,199
last one. Where? Where am I trying to? Up here. Up straight up. Oh, is this wall a thing here?

298
00:45:26,659 --> 00:45:34,019
Thing? I don't know. I feel like we're missing something that can reflect the light in something

299
00:45:34,019 --> 00:45:51,610
else. Well, I can't. I mean, I can do this. I guess I can attach to your box and I don't know

300
00:45:51,610 --> 00:46:04,699
if that helps at all. This again? No. No, it's blocking away. My forehead can reflect. Oh,

301
00:46:04,699 --> 00:46:15,900
get the fuck out of here. You motherfucker. I did. I did pick the mode where we can have multiples of

302
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:20,699
each character, but I don't think that should matter because this is this is so easy. Just

303
00:46:20,699 --> 00:46:26,380
wait doesn't change. Yeah. As far as I was aware, and I don't know if I could change to this point

304
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:33,659
because I mean, yeah, I could just also do that instantly. But I don't want to do that.

305
00:46:33,659 --> 00:46:42,070
There's a no switch mode. So there is a no switching characters mode. Yeah. Oh,

306
00:46:43,110 --> 00:46:47,269
but I don't think the game changes depending on whether or not you've selected that mode

307
00:46:49,110 --> 00:46:54,309
the game changes. I'm saying I don't think that it does. Well, that's somebody didn't just said

308
00:46:54,309 --> 00:47:00,039
like I just watched somebody do this and the game does change. Really? Yeah. Apparently the game

309
00:47:00,039 --> 00:47:05,000
changes. There's less objects. Okay. How about if we go to main menu and I re-invite everybody and

310
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:15,909
we see? Yeah, let's do that. Wait, they're lying. Are they lying? We're confirming. Are they lying?

311
00:47:16,710 --> 00:47:22,599
It's okay. I made it. We could switch all solely because I forgot in the beginning. You all get

312
00:47:22,599 --> 00:47:26,760
to be the guys and I all want it to slam. That's just like the old. That's all I want. That's like

313
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:32,119
like the old school. Yeah. Yeah. That's that's the one thing I wanted. Okay. So let me know when

314
00:47:32,119 --> 00:47:48,889
you're ready. I invited you guys. Okay. Okay. There it is. You're gonna trust his chat way too

315
00:47:48,889 --> 00:47:54,889
much. No, no, I'm telling somebody. People have like proof apparently. This better not start from

316
00:47:54,889 --> 00:48:04,019
beginning. I'm gonna fucking scream. Apparently this video proof. Yeah. Oh my god. It's the whole

317
00:48:04,019 --> 00:48:12,679
thing. What? No. No, it's not. Attending a wizarding conference with his fellow wizards.

318
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:23,260
Hold on. Hold on. I'm seeing if I can. It's not letting me change levels. It's like we never even

319
00:48:23,260 --> 00:48:28,460
did the other ones because it's because it's a different game time to find that mailbox or

320
00:48:28,460 --> 00:48:40,230
different mode. Yeah. I knew this was gonna fucking happen. Speedrun. Speedrun. Anyone who just joined.

321
00:48:40,230 --> 00:48:55,989
You didn't miss anything. Fast. Go. Oh no. But but but we have to do them all. We have to do all of

322
00:48:55,989 --> 00:49:05,050
them. We'll skip the cutscenes. It'll be really fast. Okay. Very fast. Very fast. You could just

323
00:49:05,050 --> 00:49:09,289
talk to your chat about like life and stuff. You were driving down the road the other day and you

324
00:49:09,289 --> 00:49:17,130
had the coffee. No, no, no. I've had too many coffees. There's no more. What? In the world?

325
00:49:17,130 --> 00:49:23,110
There's no more. I drank them all so I can't do those stories anymore. Uppy. Uppy. I don't understand.

326
00:49:23,110 --> 00:49:30,840
The world has made more coffee since then. You would think. Are you swearing off coffee or do you have like

327
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:35,960
a heart condition now? I didn't actually. I still can drink coffee. It's the one thing I still am

328
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:46,630
allowed to do. You just. Nothing else. Nothing else. Sticky snow. All four boxes are the same color now.

329
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:57,639
That was a very genuine. My god.

330
00:49:58,119 --> 00:50:00,119
Oh my god. Oh my god.

331
00:50:22,059 --> 00:50:24,059
I'm just trying to get up there like fast. You know what I mean?

332
00:50:25,019 --> 00:50:29,340
I'm going to solo this level. Oh, we got to recollect all the things.

333
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:41,260
It's only right. Got it. Just die. Just die. Die. Die. Just die. How do I die? I don't know. You

334
00:50:41,260 --> 00:50:47,130
just get over here, right? You can just like teleport to me. I don't know how. Wait, we need

335
00:50:47,130 --> 00:50:53,929
these. My trustworthy box magic. All you have to do is reach the mailbox and then it'll end. Just

336
00:50:53,929 --> 00:51:08,820
reach the mailbox star. I'm doing it. I gotta go get my mail. Oh, poor girl. I can't believe

337
00:51:08,820 --> 00:51:15,530
we would do this again. Well, now we. Here, you guys collect the things. I'm going forward.

338
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:26,730
I need another box. I really should have sent this postcard earlier to market. Why isn't this

339
00:51:26,730 --> 00:51:29,769
nearest mailbox located any closer to civilization?

340
00:51:36,650 --> 00:51:41,690
Oh, this is the tryhard sounds of keyboard clicking and sounds.

341
00:51:44,090 --> 00:51:52,199
I need wait. Waiting for other players to continue. I need you guys to activate the

342
00:51:52,199 --> 00:52:03,050
goat cut scene. What? What? No. I'm like stuck in this one thing. Fuck. No. Hold on. I'll get you.

343
00:52:03,050 --> 00:52:09,699
I'm coming. I'm coming. I'm coming. I'm coming. We should like disconnect. Oh, no. I got it. I

344
00:52:09,699 --> 00:52:14,260
glitched out and I got it. All right. Good. Because we need each other over here. All right.

345
00:52:14,260 --> 00:52:26,179
Run. The speed run is taking longer than the actual run. Yes. I mean, it kind of sort of.

346
00:52:27,139 --> 00:52:33,030
Okay. Now you stick that one on the sticky one over here. There's a sticky one here.

347
00:52:34,070 --> 00:52:41,019
Yeah. $500 bounty on anyone who can figure out goat skip. Right there. The snow is sticky. Now

348
00:52:41,019 --> 00:52:51,179
we need to weigh it down. So weigh this end down. Like this? Yeah. Like over here so we

349
00:52:51,179 --> 00:53:00,039
could jump to it. Started. Did this one last time. How are you guys still back there?

350
00:53:00,039 --> 00:53:07,590
Yeah. We need to know here. Go. Well, you're going to be stuck here. You're going to weigh

351
00:53:07,590 --> 00:53:16,139
yourself down. Just jump off the map. There is no pit here. Jump off the map. Are you not even to

352
00:53:16,139 --> 00:53:20,699
the fucking the bridge thing yet? There you go. All right. No, no, just stay. He's going to make

353
00:53:20,699 --> 00:53:25,420
it from here. I'm not a wizard. I'm a warrior. You're time to open up the drama stream to see

354
00:53:25,420 --> 00:53:31,099
where you're at so I can give my helpful tips and tricks for trying for. Wait, what happened?

355
00:53:31,900 --> 00:53:37,739
Okay. There you go. Now. There you go. Yeah. You got it. Yeah. Shut up. Shut up. I don't want to

356
00:53:37,739 --> 00:53:47,510
hear it. I can ban you all and I will. All right. Let's go. We're almost there. We've almost made

357
00:53:47,510 --> 00:53:57,260
it. Yes. Oh yeah. Right. We just die. Yes. Death warp. That's how you do it. Okay. Now we need a

358
00:53:57,260 --> 00:54:18,090
goat. How do you activate the goat? Dude, this is taking longer than the last one. Why don't you

359
00:54:18,090 --> 00:54:23,130
guys just stay near a pit so that when I get forward, you can. Yeah. But some of the stuff

360
00:54:23,130 --> 00:54:26,889
you have to have to more than one person do. No, you don't. No, you don't. No, you don't.

361
00:54:30,039 --> 00:54:37,719
It's trying. You don't. Everything in trying can be done with one person. Oh yeah. If you can

362
00:54:37,719 --> 00:54:48,949
character switch. What about the game mode we just played? Get those. Well, Jerma, we've already done

363
00:54:48,949 --> 00:55:08,380
this level. We got the letter. Oh, wait. We need. All right. Here we go. Where are you? Come on.

364
00:55:08,940 --> 00:55:15,480
It's spawning me back from the pit. Oh, it's spawning you back at the pit. Oh shit. Well,

365
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:28,360
I have a levitating device here. All right. Now I'm going to do this. Come on. Get it. Get it.

366
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:34,199
Oh, no, you got it right there. I figured I figured out how to do one person light reflect.

367
00:55:34,199 --> 00:55:37,559
You picked the wrong skill. There's a dream shield where you can leave an

368
00:55:37,559 --> 00:55:41,719
ethereal copy of your shield in place. And so you pick the wrong skill.

369
00:55:43,159 --> 00:55:47,800
And I think it was a bonus. I think it was a bonus objective because we could continue without it.

370
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:52,679
Can we just confirm? I mean, you already got the joke across everybody in chat. Is this real?

371
00:55:52,679 --> 00:55:57,130
Well, was this just like a like is this did they actually have less objects

372
00:55:57,769 --> 00:56:02,170
in this motion? You already got us. So might as well just come clean here.

373
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:06,969
What? I'm just asking if this game both things actually real.

374
00:56:07,849 --> 00:56:17,690
What? It's not. It's not. What's going on? I'm not doing this. You're doing it.

375
00:56:17,690 --> 00:56:24,699
I'm not doing this right now. I don't know how to start a game that's not at level one.

376
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:32,679
A shame about the endless kill us back in the day with tended feels.

377
00:56:32,679 --> 00:56:36,519
What the fuck is going on? Are you stuck?

378
00:56:36,519 --> 00:56:39,000
I just my character just like lagged out. I'm dying.

379
00:56:39,559 --> 00:56:43,239
Well, no, I'm actually somewhere where you can die and I'll be done.

380
00:56:43,239 --> 00:56:50,820
I'll I'll be done to say, OK, I should teleport to you know, it's a haunted old man.

381
00:56:50,820 --> 00:57:00,570
What? I don't know how you do this doesn't make any sense.

382
00:57:01,369 --> 00:57:09,480
Switch it to the PS1 quick. Yeah, it could work.

383
00:57:10,119 --> 00:57:16,789
Do you guys have this on PS4? We could switch. Of course, I bought a copy in every system.

384
00:57:17,820 --> 00:57:23,000
Same. That's how much preparation I put in for the stream.

385
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,840
Now, can I get some people dances in the chat, please?

386
00:57:26,070 --> 00:57:39,960
You put better.

387
00:57:46,570 --> 00:57:49,369
Can we all agree actually that it was Ashley's fault?

388
00:57:49,369 --> 00:57:51,769
Why? Because she picked the wrong skill.

389
00:57:52,570 --> 00:57:54,650
Well, how did you pick those corrected?

390
00:57:54,650 --> 00:57:57,530
How a good night to turn. I picked the first thing that

391
00:57:57,530 --> 00:58:01,449
looks like it wasn't locked on my screen. How are you supposed to know that?

392
00:58:06,579 --> 00:58:10,119
It's her fault. It's really her fault.

393
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:17,719
I feel like all right because we get to experience like the big like

394
00:58:17,719 --> 00:58:21,719
hog moment of when we get the huge one again. You know what I mean? Remember that?

395
00:58:37,639 --> 00:58:39,159
Oh, yeah, I remember this moment.

396
00:58:40,119 --> 00:58:43,400
OK, I'm forward. One, two, three.

397
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:47,320
Why did you say go? Because it's a speed run.

398
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:53,139
Well, I'm backward. One, two, three.

399
00:58:56,300 --> 00:58:57,820
Got it. No, I didn't. I went too high.

400
00:59:00,119 --> 00:59:04,760
All right. I'm blocking the I'm just standing here. You just shoot it.

401
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:12,789
OK, let's go. Yeah, let's go.

402
00:59:15,110 --> 00:59:15,590
Let's go.

403
00:59:23,019 --> 00:59:26,139
Again, make sure he bounces it towards you.

404
00:59:26,139 --> 00:59:32,539
You get it then go watch this.

405
00:59:32,539 --> 00:59:36,340
Got it immediately. Oh, we're so good.

406
00:59:39,849 --> 00:59:42,900
Oh, world's first. World's first.

407
00:59:42,900 --> 00:59:46,420
Is that like six seconds? Skip, skip.

408
00:59:50,300 --> 00:59:51,820
I almost just exited to the main menu.

409
00:59:55,699 --> 00:59:58,019
It's going to be really funny when we do this for every stage,

410
00:59:58,019 --> 01:00:01,219
even the ones we haven't seen yet, because we actually practice this on stream.

411
01:00:01,219 --> 01:00:02,260
I'm talking to myself.

412
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:07,300
You know, actually, I was thinking you can tell me what the scale of comedy this would be.

413
01:00:08,500 --> 01:00:13,219
I was thinking of like a long time ago, you know, like Dark Souls one speed runs.

414
01:00:14,179 --> 01:00:19,510
Yeah, I was thinking, what if I just opened up Dark Souls was like, you know what, guys,

415
01:00:19,510 --> 01:00:23,510
I'm going to like play Dark Souls. This is before I even played Dark Souls one like on stream, right?

416
01:00:24,230 --> 01:00:31,989
What if I practiced the first like 12 minutes of like the Dark Souls one speed run

417
01:00:31,989 --> 01:00:35,190
and got it perfect and just turned it on, just started fucking going.

418
01:00:37,210 --> 01:00:40,650
I kind of did that with Dark Messiah where I didn't say I was going to speed run it,

419
01:00:40,650 --> 01:00:42,329
and I just knew all the speed run tricks.

420
01:00:43,050 --> 01:00:46,889
Yeah, but I'm talking like actual, like you learn the actual route.

421
01:00:47,130 --> 01:00:48,010
Like you hate them.

422
01:00:49,929 --> 01:00:54,599
Oh no, he hates us. Sad.

423
01:00:55,320 --> 01:01:00,119
Wait, wait, so I gave an example of me doing it and your counterpoint was no, but actually.

424
01:01:00,119 --> 01:01:04,840
No, no, there's a difference. No, there's a difference between I just play this game a

425
01:01:04,840 --> 01:01:10,440
lot and know some of the routes to I'm doing the actual like any percent route on Dark Souls one.

426
01:01:12,710 --> 01:01:15,110
There's a difference between I know this game pretty well.

427
01:01:15,670 --> 01:01:19,110
No, no, I knew the speed run route. I did the speed run route.

428
01:01:21,239 --> 01:01:22,599
Was it the first time you ever played it?

429
01:01:27,099 --> 01:01:29,820
This is your joke and you're not giving me credit for it.

430
01:01:30,619 --> 01:01:33,190
He didn't do that. Did he do that guys?

431
01:01:37,369 --> 01:01:39,289
No lonely, sad man.

432
01:01:39,929 --> 01:01:42,440
He didn't do it. All right, hold it back.

433
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:43,880
No, he didn't. I'm seeing a lot of nos.

434
01:01:44,679 --> 01:01:51,130
Dark Messiah. Dark Messiah doesn't have routes is what people are saying.

435
01:01:52,570 --> 01:01:53,690
They're calling you out.

436
01:01:59,829 --> 01:02:01,429
You're not going to get the germ of blood.

437
01:02:02,840 --> 01:02:04,039
Those balloons have things in them.

438
01:02:06,150 --> 01:02:08,550
Now you agree it's germ of blood. Oh no, we fucked it up.

439
01:02:14,579 --> 01:02:18,420
No, we had it. You had to get the blood.

440
01:02:18,420 --> 01:02:21,219
But I was yelled at. Everyone was like, dude, blood.

441
01:02:21,940 --> 01:02:24,739
I get yelled at all the time living with this guy.

442
01:02:26,199 --> 01:02:29,559
Eventually, you just learn to live with it.

443
01:02:29,559 --> 01:02:32,969
Now I'm going to pull this. Okay, now you pull it.

444
01:02:33,690 --> 01:02:36,329
Now you make sure I can get across. Next I got it.

445
01:02:40,059 --> 01:02:47,610
He's actually not getting these in the route. You get those because you need to have at least

446
01:02:47,610 --> 01:02:53,719
15 to get the one skill. Yeah, he thinks he knows the routes.

447
01:02:54,440 --> 01:03:02,420
This is actually like, I really like them. I need these.

448
01:03:02,420 --> 01:03:03,460
All right, whatever. Who cares?

449
01:03:04,099 --> 01:03:15,909
He's made the decision for us apparently. Hey, Steve, we hate you.

450
01:03:16,949 --> 01:03:24,780
Yeah, I know. Why can't you be more likeable?

451
01:03:24,780 --> 01:03:27,179
Hey, what have I happened to? I can do this all by myself.

452
01:03:27,179 --> 01:03:28,539
Everything can be done. I got here.

453
01:03:28,539 --> 01:03:32,699
I was doing everything by myself and I was trying to figure out how to do that one.

454
01:03:33,739 --> 01:03:35,179
I'm sure there's a way. Actually,

455
01:03:35,179 --> 01:03:37,739
probably if you connected the rope on both of them, you could probably do it.

456
01:03:41,429 --> 01:03:44,789
If I told you to open Dark Messiah up right now and do the first 20 minutes in a route,

457
01:03:44,789 --> 01:03:45,429
would you be able to do it?

458
01:03:54,420 --> 01:03:56,980
Yeah, I think I could. I think I could do it.

459
01:04:01,619 --> 01:04:03,139
Unfortunately, we don't have time for that.

460
01:04:03,780 --> 01:04:08,340
And Jerma, you think it's like, oh, you just you didn't even the beginning of Dark Messiah.

461
01:04:08,340 --> 01:04:13,780
One of the skips requires you to break cut scene, break, go out of like,

462
01:04:13,780 --> 01:04:16,579
like the whole cut scenes happening and you're walking around outside of it.

463
01:04:16,579 --> 01:04:19,619
Then edge clip on the edge of the map, but pause the screen.

464
01:04:19,619 --> 01:04:22,420
And while the game is paused, you pause for an exact amount of time.

465
01:04:22,420 --> 01:04:26,980
And then it launches you forward over a castle wall, specifically into one exact window.

466
01:04:26,980 --> 01:04:29,860
And I did that without mentioning that I knew any of this.

467
01:04:29,860 --> 01:04:32,659
And this is your joke. And I know this for it.

468
01:04:33,539 --> 01:04:35,780
Why did why did you do that? Why did you why did you play it on stream?

469
01:04:35,780 --> 01:04:39,139
Then just trying to prove how much better you are than everybody else.

470
01:04:39,139 --> 01:04:41,380
I thought I loved that game and I thought it was funny.

471
01:04:42,500 --> 01:04:43,940
It's your joke. You get it.

472
01:04:44,820 --> 01:04:45,940
You get why I did it.

473
01:05:03,769 --> 01:05:06,250
Oh, no, no, I'm the wizard. Why am I the wizard?

474
01:05:09,610 --> 01:05:10,010
Players.

475
01:05:12,409 --> 01:05:14,889
Rowdy wants to switch with Ashley. What?

476
01:05:14,889 --> 01:05:16,889
What? No, no, you don't.

477
01:05:16,889 --> 01:05:17,449
How did I do that?

478
01:05:17,449 --> 01:05:18,889
You want to switch with me? How do we?

479
01:05:18,889 --> 01:05:21,289
I just pressed like our I just pressed red.

480
01:05:21,289 --> 01:05:24,010
Okay, I press red, red, red bumper.

481
01:05:24,010 --> 01:05:24,969
Red Rover.

482
01:05:24,969 --> 01:05:28,809
I was about to say red, red bumper.

483
01:05:28,809 --> 01:05:30,489
What? Right bumper.

484
01:05:31,449 --> 01:05:32,570
You got monkeys on the brain.

485
01:05:35,659 --> 01:05:38,539
Okay, remember, remember to pick the right skill this time, Ashley.

486
01:05:40,070 --> 01:05:40,789
Red rum.

487
01:05:42,469 --> 01:05:44,389
Oh, murder on the brain. Oh, shit.

488
01:05:45,190 --> 01:05:48,170
Hold on. All right.

489
01:05:48,170 --> 01:05:49,369
We're actually playing the game now.

490
01:05:49,369 --> 01:05:51,210
This is no longer the tutorial. We want to get the stuff.

491
01:05:53,510 --> 01:05:57,130
I think you need to do the super launch, right?

492
01:05:57,769 --> 01:05:59,289
The butt launch on here on the other side.

493
01:05:59,289 --> 01:06:01,449
Do the butt launch. Do the butt launch.

494
01:06:01,449 --> 01:06:02,409
Nice. There you go.

495
01:06:03,210 --> 01:06:08,980
Oh, wait, I need those.

496
01:06:09,619 --> 01:06:11,460
We got to go down. There's a lot of things down.

497
01:06:12,260 --> 01:06:13,139
Oh, yeah, there is.

498
01:06:15,820 --> 01:06:17,179
And you got a rope over here.

499
01:06:18,059 --> 01:06:18,860
Uh huh.

500
01:06:18,860 --> 01:06:20,940
Yeah, this is what I'm freaking talking about right now.

501
01:06:21,179 --> 01:06:22,380
All right, now we have a level up.

502
01:06:23,179 --> 01:06:24,059
We got a treasure.

503
01:06:26,699 --> 01:06:27,739
Yeah, I got that before.

504
01:06:29,019 --> 01:06:30,300
None of you were optimized.

505
01:06:30,300 --> 01:06:34,300
I'm so far ahead of you doing the speed run, doing the joke, not getting credit.

506
01:06:34,300 --> 01:06:38,460
I was thinking about this new series on YouTube telling me if this is interesting or not.

507
01:06:38,460 --> 01:06:42,139
Where I watch a movie or a TV show that it's weird.

508
01:06:43,099 --> 01:06:46,460
And I make a video that breaks it all down and shit.

509
01:06:46,460 --> 01:06:47,019
But Pog!

510
01:06:47,980 --> 01:06:48,860
Pog moment, hold on.

511
01:06:49,820 --> 01:06:50,219
Shoot it.

512
01:06:53,260 --> 01:06:54,219
Don't want to break it.

513
01:06:54,219 --> 01:06:54,619
I got it.

514
01:06:55,639 --> 01:06:57,079
I mean, you're going to call the series.

515
01:06:57,079 --> 01:06:58,119
What are you doing?

516
01:06:58,119 --> 01:07:01,079
No series is going to call like, dude, what is this box?

517
01:07:01,079 --> 01:07:01,800
Where was this?

518
01:07:01,800 --> 01:07:03,320
This is called. This is a different game mode.

519
01:07:03,320 --> 01:07:05,000
We didn't know. We did not get you baited by Chad.

520
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:05,400
It was real.

521
01:07:07,909 --> 01:07:08,710
Okay.

522
01:07:08,710 --> 01:07:11,590
Okay. Well, go down, go down here, go to the bottom.

523
01:07:11,590 --> 01:07:12,469
All right, we can do that.

524
01:07:12,469 --> 01:07:12,949
That works.

525
01:07:15,030 --> 01:07:16,309
I can't believe we cheesed it.

526
01:07:17,269 --> 01:07:20,630
It was up here the whole time where I was poking around before.

527
01:07:20,630 --> 01:07:21,030
Okay.

528
01:07:21,030 --> 01:07:22,949
What's so urgent about getting this boy back?

529
01:07:22,949 --> 01:07:25,349
Wait, maybe they want stuff.

530
01:07:25,349 --> 01:07:25,510
Yeah.

531
01:07:30,199 --> 01:07:30,679
I'm mad.

532
01:07:31,639 --> 01:07:33,320
Hey, you picked the game mode.

533
01:07:33,320 --> 01:07:33,800
I did.

534
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:36,519
And it's my fault because I really just wanted us to all pound the ground.

535
01:07:36,519 --> 01:07:37,800
And we briefly did anyway.

536
01:07:38,679 --> 01:07:39,800
It was really important.

537
01:07:39,800 --> 01:07:41,159
Look how many of these they give us.

538
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:43,320
Yeah, this is a different game.

539
01:07:46,250 --> 01:07:48,329
You can get off of it, Rowdy.

540
01:07:49,690 --> 01:07:50,889
I don't even need both of those.

541
01:07:52,440 --> 01:07:53,400
I don't even need them.

542
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:54,199
That's offensive.

543
01:07:54,920 --> 01:07:55,639
I don't even need them.

544
01:07:56,440 --> 01:07:58,579
Oh, yeah.

545
01:07:58,579 --> 01:07:58,820
Yeah.

546
01:07:59,699 --> 01:08:00,340
That's why.

547
01:08:00,340 --> 01:08:00,739
Okay.

548
01:08:00,739 --> 01:08:03,300
Level up, but maybe don't level up.

549
01:08:04,179 --> 01:08:05,269
All right.

550
01:08:05,269 --> 01:08:05,829
Hit tab.

551
01:08:06,949 --> 01:08:08,389
I guess you don't get those till later.

552
01:08:08,949 --> 01:08:09,110
Yeah.

553
01:08:09,110 --> 01:08:10,710
You couldn't actually get dream shield.

554
01:08:11,989 --> 01:08:12,630
Oh, yeah.

555
01:08:12,630 --> 01:08:15,429
I took the other skill because it was the only one that I could take.

556
01:08:15,429 --> 01:08:16,949
Thanks for blaming me for nothing.

557
01:08:16,949 --> 01:08:19,029
I can't believe Ashley would fuck this whole thing up.

558
01:08:20,229 --> 01:08:23,399
I mean, what are you talking about?

559
01:08:23,399 --> 01:08:25,479
Buying the lightning sword again.

560
01:08:27,779 --> 01:08:28,899
Found a new letter.

561
01:08:29,859 --> 01:08:32,420
I hope you have found the missing prints by now.

562
01:08:32,420 --> 01:08:33,060
You can read them.

563
01:08:33,060 --> 01:08:33,539
I don't want them.

564
01:08:33,539 --> 01:08:35,300
If not, please be warned.

565
01:08:35,300 --> 01:08:43,449
Oh, reading the story in Trine.

566
01:08:44,250 --> 01:08:46,250
I mean, like, really?

567
01:08:47,609 --> 01:08:49,609
Reading the lore snippets in Trine.

568
01:08:57,930 --> 01:08:59,130
What a big bird.

569
01:09:00,090 --> 01:09:01,930
But wait, hold on.

570
01:09:03,210 --> 01:09:04,729
Yeah, because then I need to go down here

571
01:09:04,729 --> 01:09:06,409
and get these little gumdrops.

572
01:09:08,409 --> 01:09:11,609
No, Star, you cannot recreate the video.

573
01:09:11,609 --> 01:09:12,170
I'm sorry.

574
01:09:12,170 --> 01:09:14,170
I know it was a funny video,

575
01:09:14,170 --> 01:09:16,409
but we can't just try to recreate it.

576
01:09:17,539 --> 01:09:18,819
That season already exists on TV.

577
01:09:18,819 --> 01:09:20,260
I should have dropped the whole thing.

578
01:09:20,260 --> 01:09:22,819
That was the real video inside us the whole time.

579
01:09:23,699 --> 01:09:24,420
Inside of you?

580
01:09:24,979 --> 01:09:25,220
Yeah.

581
01:09:27,220 --> 01:09:31,060
Pepehands, old German, old Star.

582
01:09:32,789 --> 01:09:34,789
The video was like 2014.

583
01:09:35,430 --> 01:09:36,310
That's what everyone says.

584
01:09:36,310 --> 01:09:37,350
I missed the old star.

585
01:09:39,189 --> 01:09:40,710
Okay, I can attach to this.

586
01:09:40,710 --> 01:09:43,880
So what does it want us to do?

587
01:09:43,880 --> 01:09:44,600
Stick it up there.

588
01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:46,140
Stop.

589
01:09:46,920 --> 01:09:47,319
Stop.

590
01:09:47,319 --> 01:09:48,199
Just for a second.

591
01:09:48,199 --> 01:09:48,760
Stop.

592
01:09:48,760 --> 01:09:49,800
Like we had it.

593
01:09:49,800 --> 01:09:50,840
I missed the old star.

594
01:09:52,439 --> 01:09:53,479
I'm trying to recreate it.

595
01:09:55,670 --> 01:09:56,310
All right, I get it.

596
01:09:58,250 --> 01:09:58,970
What about you?

597
01:09:58,970 --> 01:09:59,529
What about me?

598
01:09:59,529 --> 01:10:00,569
Are you confident with your hook?

599
01:10:04,939 --> 01:10:06,779
So I got one attached and now bring me up.

600
01:10:08,699 --> 01:10:10,460
When you are attached to it, I can't lift it.

601
01:10:14,439 --> 01:10:15,640
What am I supposed to do?

602
01:10:15,640 --> 01:10:18,279
Just stand on the left and jump across, but don't attach.

603
01:10:19,319 --> 01:10:20,279
It was the explosions.

604
01:10:20,279 --> 01:10:22,199
It was like it was the stomping that freaked me out.

605
01:10:22,199 --> 01:10:23,399
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

606
01:10:23,399 --> 01:10:24,680
I'm giving you motivation.

607
01:10:24,680 --> 01:10:25,159
What is this?

608
01:10:25,880 --> 01:10:26,359
Monsters.

609
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:30,600
You actually have to fight in this game.

610
01:10:31,399 --> 01:10:34,630
These are the things that stole the prince.

611
01:10:34,630 --> 01:11:01,640
This is like a little secret area, I guess.

612
01:11:02,920 --> 01:11:05,779
I guess, man.

613
01:11:05,779 --> 01:11:06,739
Oh, I see.

614
01:11:13,720 --> 01:11:15,319
Wow, that's that's one tap.

615
01:11:15,880 --> 01:11:17,399
Okay.

616
01:11:20,359 --> 01:11:21,960
Why don't you just bring it over here?

617
01:11:26,140 --> 01:11:27,180
Maybe you go to the bottom.

618
01:11:29,739 --> 01:11:30,619
Then you can do it more.

619
01:11:31,579 --> 01:11:33,500
Can you make a rope for me to stand on, Jeremy?

620
01:11:33,500 --> 01:11:33,899
I can.

621
01:11:38,779 --> 01:11:39,819
Maybe I can give you the box.

622
01:11:40,539 --> 01:11:42,119
I mean, you can stand on that.

623
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:44,619
It's gonna work.

624
01:11:50,729 --> 01:11:51,369
All right.

625
01:11:51,369 --> 01:11:52,250
There we go.

626
01:11:52,250 --> 01:11:53,449
See, all three of us.

627
01:11:54,329 --> 01:11:55,850
That's a true Trier moment.

628
01:11:56,489 --> 01:11:57,289
Another big one.

629
01:11:58,329 --> 01:12:00,890
There's a word, there's a word I'm gonna say.

630
01:12:00,890 --> 01:12:02,649
I can't, I don't know what it is.

631
01:12:05,689 --> 01:12:06,409
The chat's already doing it.

632
01:12:06,409 --> 01:12:06,810
It's fine.

633
01:12:06,810 --> 01:12:07,449
That's what it was.

634
01:12:08,250 --> 01:12:09,939
What was the word?

635
01:12:09,939 --> 01:12:10,739
I'm not in that chat.

636
01:12:11,460 --> 01:12:12,659
Say the word out loud.

637
01:12:12,659 --> 01:12:13,300
Loud and proud.

638
01:12:13,300 --> 01:12:15,539
I don't know if I can right now.

639
01:12:15,539 --> 01:12:16,180
Nothing happened.

640
01:12:19,500 --> 01:12:20,140
Oh, my God.

641
01:12:22,180 --> 01:12:34,600
Here, more of these under here.

642
01:12:37,880 --> 01:12:39,109
Cool.

643
01:12:39,109 --> 01:12:39,989
You gotta get the blood.

644
01:12:41,430 --> 01:12:41,989
Yeah, I did.

645
01:12:42,630 --> 01:12:43,750
Get off, get off.

646
01:12:44,710 --> 01:12:49,640
You really are the like little brother, aren't you?

647
01:12:49,640 --> 01:12:50,279
Get off.

648
01:12:50,279 --> 01:12:50,920
Get up here.

649
01:12:50,920 --> 01:12:51,800
Ashley, up top.

650
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:52,439
I'm getting off.

651
01:12:52,439 --> 01:12:52,920
Get off of it.

652
01:12:52,920 --> 01:12:53,319
It's mine.

653
01:12:53,319 --> 01:12:53,640
Get off.

654
01:12:53,640 --> 01:12:54,279
Get off of it.

655
01:12:55,239 --> 01:12:55,800
Get off of that.

656
01:12:57,130 --> 01:12:57,449
Okay.

657
01:13:06,170 --> 01:13:07,609
Yeah, I didn't like that one.

658
01:13:07,609 --> 01:13:08,810
I don't like that one either.

659
01:13:08,810 --> 01:13:10,489
Somebody said, wow, you all suck.

660
01:13:10,489 --> 01:13:11,770
This place is a freak show.

661
01:13:12,329 --> 01:13:14,010
You fucking guys are so bad at this game.

662
01:13:14,010 --> 01:13:14,729
Like, I'm missing dinner now.

663
01:13:14,729 --> 01:13:15,529
What are you referring to your chat?

664
01:13:16,489 --> 01:13:16,970
I don't know.

665
01:13:17,529 --> 01:13:18,090
I don't know what you're talking about.

666
01:13:18,090 --> 01:13:18,890
Who are you talking about?

667
01:13:19,689 --> 01:13:20,649
The freak show.

668
01:13:20,649 --> 01:13:22,569
Otherwise known as German's chat.

669
01:13:22,569 --> 01:13:26,250
Yeah, the insight, the what an inhumane psychopath.

670
01:13:27,609 --> 01:13:29,000
You guys need this ball.

671
01:13:34,060 --> 01:13:34,460
True.

672
01:13:34,460 --> 01:13:35,420
I'm going to be true.

673
01:13:37,140 --> 01:13:37,699
What?

674
01:13:37,699 --> 01:13:37,939
All right.

675
01:13:37,939 --> 01:13:39,619
Now, if you do the super blast,

676
01:13:40,500 --> 01:13:41,539
you can launch the ball up.

677
01:13:41,539 --> 01:13:42,579
Here we go.

678
01:13:42,579 --> 01:13:43,539
There it is.

679
01:13:43,539 --> 01:13:44,180
Do it again.

680
01:13:47,829 --> 01:13:47,989
No.

681
01:13:49,430 --> 01:13:50,550
Oh, nice one.

682
01:13:51,189 --> 01:13:52,310
Do we even need that thing for now?

683
01:13:53,979 --> 01:13:54,460
Nope.

684
01:13:54,460 --> 01:13:55,750
Now we don't.

685
01:13:55,750 --> 01:13:56,229
All right.

686
01:13:56,229 --> 01:13:57,670
I'm going to attach this to this.

687
01:13:58,630 --> 01:14:00,470
I don't know.

688
01:14:00,470 --> 01:14:00,869
Maybe not.

689
01:14:02,539 --> 01:14:03,659
Oh, it's just I see.

690
01:14:06,890 --> 01:14:08,090
Oh, I got to jam this.

691
01:14:10,199 --> 01:14:11,720
Can you get off that block?

692
01:14:12,680 --> 01:14:12,920
Okay.

693
01:14:12,920 --> 01:14:13,239
You got.

694
01:14:13,239 --> 01:14:13,479
Okay.

695
01:14:13,479 --> 01:14:14,039
You know, you got.

696
01:14:14,039 --> 01:14:14,760
I was holding still.

697
01:14:14,760 --> 01:14:15,000
Okay.

698
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:15,640
I wasn't.

699
01:14:15,640 --> 01:14:15,800
Yeah.

700
01:14:15,800 --> 01:14:16,119
Okay.

701
01:14:16,840 --> 01:14:17,159
Okay.

702
01:14:18,359 --> 01:14:19,960
I fucking love this guy.

703
01:14:19,960 --> 01:14:21,239
German985.

704
01:14:21,239 --> 01:14:21,640
They call him.

705
01:14:23,640 --> 01:14:24,760
Steve, please.

706
01:14:24,760 --> 01:14:24,920
What?

707
01:14:26,920 --> 01:14:28,279
If I was running away from school,

708
01:14:28,279 --> 01:14:31,560
I'd go somewhere with more entertainment prospects.

709
01:14:31,560 --> 01:14:32,199
Wait, what does that do?

710
01:14:33,319 --> 01:14:34,279
Does that like activate a button?

711
01:14:34,920 --> 01:14:35,560
Did you press that?

712
01:14:36,439 --> 01:14:36,760
No, I didn't.

713
01:14:36,760 --> 01:14:37,000
What?

714
01:14:38,420 --> 01:14:39,779
I think we can pull the thing down.

715
01:14:40,579 --> 01:14:44,020
Guys, remember when we went to the trampoline park?

716
01:14:44,579 --> 01:14:45,220
Yeah, it was fun.

717
01:14:46,020 --> 01:14:47,859
Steve clipped split his pants.

718
01:14:48,579 --> 01:14:50,180
Oh, yeah, I did.

719
01:14:51,140 --> 01:14:51,460
Whoa.

720
01:14:53,859 --> 01:14:54,579
Help me.

721
01:14:55,300 --> 01:14:56,260
I'm such a simple.

722
01:15:09,829 --> 01:15:10,550
Does that help us?

723
01:15:12,500 --> 01:15:15,699
Well, it lets you do this thing to get up on the thing.

724
01:15:16,979 --> 01:15:18,420
But then you guys have to get up here, too.

725
01:15:23,369 --> 01:15:24,250
So how do you get up here?

726
01:15:25,050 --> 01:15:25,289
Uh.

727
01:15:27,159 --> 01:15:27,960
Do I need you?

728
01:15:27,960 --> 01:15:29,479
Wait, I might have to do it.

729
01:15:29,479 --> 01:15:29,720
Okay.

730
01:15:30,840 --> 01:15:31,720
He's just a gamer.

731
01:15:31,720 --> 01:15:32,279
That's all it is.

732
01:15:33,079 --> 01:15:34,359
That looked totally wrong.

733
01:15:44,920 --> 01:15:46,039
Let go, German.

734
01:15:46,039 --> 01:15:46,439
Do I?

735
01:15:48,539 --> 01:15:48,779
Yeah.

736
01:15:50,090 --> 01:15:51,289
Well, there's a little hook on it,

737
01:15:51,289 --> 01:15:52,569
so it makes me want to participate.

738
01:15:52,569 --> 01:15:53,529
You go there.

739
01:15:53,529 --> 01:15:54,329
Where he's standing.

740
01:16:07,430 --> 01:16:07,829
Smash.

741
01:16:08,630 --> 01:16:08,869
Yeah.

742
01:16:10,710 --> 01:16:13,130
It's very satisfying.

743
01:16:13,930 --> 01:16:17,300
Dude, I just love smashing.

744
01:16:17,300 --> 01:16:19,859
Remember when Star spit on German's pizza?

745
01:16:19,859 --> 01:16:20,100
What?

746
01:16:21,819 --> 01:16:22,300
Oh, yeah.

747
01:16:22,300 --> 01:16:22,939
Yeah.

748
01:16:22,939 --> 01:16:23,899
Wait, wait, wait.

749
01:16:23,899 --> 01:16:24,699
What are you talking about?

750
01:16:24,699 --> 01:16:25,100
What do you mean?

751
01:16:25,100 --> 01:16:26,699
Remember when you spit on my pizza?

752
01:16:27,819 --> 01:16:28,460
Yeah.

753
01:16:28,460 --> 01:16:30,619
Did you tell like a story or like laugh out loud?

754
01:16:30,619 --> 01:16:32,140
I spit on Jeremy's pizza.

755
01:16:32,859 --> 01:16:36,220
I didn't want you to find out like this.

756
01:16:37,800 --> 01:16:40,439
It's actually really funny that this is the first time you're hearing of it.

757
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:41,319
Yeah.

758
01:16:42,199 --> 01:16:43,800
This is often you walk in a train.

759
01:16:46,739 --> 01:16:47,779
Yeah, I can't get those.

760
01:16:47,779 --> 01:16:49,060
I can't get the bonus.

761
01:16:49,060 --> 01:16:50,420
Bonus bits in there.

762
01:16:50,420 --> 01:16:51,619
What do you mean you can't get the bonus bits?

763
01:16:52,340 --> 01:16:53,779
Ashley can get the bonus bits.

764
01:16:58,100 --> 01:16:58,420
Wow.

765
01:16:58,420 --> 01:17:02,260
Imagine that's the only person who isn't a streamer getting the bonus bits.

766
01:17:02,260 --> 01:17:03,859
Hey, we were going to do a thing.

767
01:17:04,659 --> 01:17:10,500
Do you remember the like you spit a huge disgusting loogie in my drink and I drank it?

768
01:17:10,500 --> 01:17:11,140
Do you remember that?

769
01:17:11,140 --> 01:17:13,380
Yeah, that was weird, though, because you wanted it.

770
01:17:14,500 --> 01:17:15,460
This one you didn't know about.

771
01:17:15,460 --> 01:17:16,180
It's your idea.

772
01:17:16,180 --> 01:17:16,500
All right.

773
01:17:16,500 --> 01:17:22,739
So you guys remember the like the Star comes in by breaks in my window stream, right?

774
01:17:22,739 --> 01:17:23,779
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

775
01:17:23,779 --> 01:17:26,579
We're going to do a thing where when he was sitting down, we were talking.

776
01:17:27,300 --> 01:17:31,619
He was I was going to get up to do something and he was going to do a disgusting, real,

777
01:17:31,619 --> 01:17:34,979
huge like Skittles loogie into the drink that was on the table.

778
01:17:35,859 --> 01:17:40,420
And then I was going to come back and without changing a frame or a cut for it,

779
01:17:40,420 --> 01:17:42,020
I was going to drink all of it.

780
01:17:42,020 --> 01:17:43,060
Like whatever.

781
01:17:43,060 --> 01:17:46,260
It was going to be like a like four or five gulps left in my soda.

782
01:17:46,260 --> 01:17:49,300
And I was going to do the whole thing and it was going to be in frame the whole time.

783
01:17:49,300 --> 01:17:51,300
Oh, that's tastes different than I remember.

784
01:17:51,300 --> 01:17:55,220
And then I was going to say you missed that taste, don't you?

785
01:17:55,220 --> 01:17:56,899
And then I was not allowed to say that.

786
01:17:56,899 --> 01:17:57,220
Yeah.

787
01:17:57,220 --> 01:17:58,180
No, you were not.

788
01:17:59,060 --> 01:18:01,699
That's why we can't because I knew you could do that.

789
01:18:02,739 --> 01:18:06,819
So that's why I was like, no, it was going to be we try and kill each other.

790
01:18:06,819 --> 01:18:07,060
Yes.

791
01:18:07,060 --> 01:18:10,659
We were like trying to poison each other, but it evolved.

792
01:18:10,659 --> 01:18:15,539
We I was I was going to go get like a cup, like two cups, like, hey, here you go.

793
01:18:15,539 --> 01:18:16,340
We're what are you?

794
01:18:16,340 --> 01:18:17,060
Are you thirsty?

795
01:18:17,699 --> 01:18:21,220
And you know, we're going to do the two cups, one of them's poison thing.

796
01:18:21,859 --> 01:18:23,859
And each time that one of us for the cup.

797
01:18:24,579 --> 01:18:25,380
No, don't do that.

798
01:18:27,050 --> 01:18:30,010
And we were going to be switching the we were going to both know,

799
01:18:30,010 --> 01:18:31,930
like I was going to try to poison star.

800
01:18:31,930 --> 01:18:32,409
Right.

801
01:18:32,409 --> 01:18:35,770
And he was going to be like, I, you know, chat, like, I know what's going on here.

802
01:18:37,050 --> 01:18:37,550
What?

803
01:18:38,170 --> 01:18:42,890
And he was going to switch the cups around and then he was going to poison one and switch it.

804
01:18:43,689 --> 01:18:44,810
You guys ever seen Princess Bride?

805
01:18:46,539 --> 01:18:46,779
Yes.

806
01:18:46,779 --> 01:18:47,340
Great movie.

807
01:18:48,220 --> 01:18:50,460
You know, that scene where he's like,

808
01:18:50,460 --> 01:18:53,500
and then I switched the poison because you switched the poisons.

809
01:18:53,500 --> 01:18:55,819
Therefore, I've got the poison in front of me.

810
01:18:56,619 --> 01:18:57,819
That is a classic.

811
01:18:57,819 --> 01:18:59,020
It's a classic piece of cinema.

812
01:18:59,819 --> 01:19:00,619
We're going to do that.

813
01:19:01,340 --> 01:19:02,539
Both of them are going to be poisoned.

814
01:19:03,260 --> 01:19:04,380
And it was just the whole stream.

815
01:19:04,380 --> 01:19:06,619
We're going to be switching back and forth poison cups.

816
01:19:10,810 --> 01:19:12,010
And we've all can drink them.

817
01:19:16,279 --> 01:19:17,880
Why didn't you do any of this?

818
01:19:17,880 --> 01:19:21,079
Because we were just like, we probably can't like do this.

819
01:19:21,960 --> 01:19:23,060
Why not?

820
01:19:23,060 --> 01:19:23,939
I forget.

821
01:19:23,939 --> 01:19:28,729
I forget why we didn't do it.

822
01:19:28,729 --> 01:19:31,529
Because there's probably something in like the Twitch Terms of Service

823
01:19:31,529 --> 01:19:34,170
where you can't pretend to poison each other on stream.

824
01:19:35,449 --> 01:19:37,850
I'm sure there's something exists there.

825
01:19:39,260 --> 01:19:40,060
Where was the harm?

826
01:19:44,550 --> 01:19:46,069
Star wasn't going to pretend.

827
01:19:47,989 --> 01:19:49,670
You actually bring poison.

828
01:19:50,630 --> 01:19:52,069
Yeah, it's funny joke.

829
01:19:52,069 --> 01:19:53,670
Who's going to drink the poison?

830
01:19:56,979 --> 01:19:58,899
Guys, I haven't done anything for like two full minutes.

831
01:19:58,899 --> 01:19:59,399
Are we good?

832
01:20:00,180 --> 01:20:00,899
We're good.

833
01:20:00,899 --> 01:20:01,619
We're good.

834
01:20:01,619 --> 01:20:03,619
You know how hard it is to order poison on the internet?

835
01:20:04,500 --> 01:20:05,699
I would hope impossible.

836
01:20:06,819 --> 01:20:08,819
Well, it's not, but it's pretty hard.

837
01:20:10,979 --> 01:20:13,539
Okay, I can attach.

838
01:20:14,260 --> 01:20:15,619
There you go.

839
01:20:16,260 --> 01:20:17,619
I watched like a murder trial.

840
01:20:17,619 --> 01:20:20,260
This guy was like the most unsure murderer of all time.

841
01:20:20,979 --> 01:20:24,100
Coming up with all these different very schemes to get rid of this guy.

842
01:20:25,300 --> 01:20:26,899
He did a lot of research.

843
01:20:26,899 --> 01:20:29,619
So I thought a lot about ordering poison on the internet.

844
01:20:32,819 --> 01:20:33,619
Why does she know?

845
01:20:39,640 --> 01:20:40,680
Oh, there's big ones up there.

846
01:20:40,680 --> 01:20:43,720
Oh, we need more bounties.

847
01:20:43,720 --> 01:20:44,920
We need more bounces.

848
01:20:44,920 --> 01:20:45,420
Launch me.

849
01:20:45,960 --> 01:20:46,760
All right, here we go.

850
01:20:48,949 --> 01:20:50,149
You got to shoot it.

851
01:20:50,149 --> 01:20:50,869
I got to shoot it.

852
01:20:50,869 --> 01:20:53,590
Okay, let's do it.

853
01:20:55,350 --> 01:20:56,550
Those weren't even big.

854
01:20:56,550 --> 01:20:58,810
Come on, this was a lot.

855
01:21:01,689 --> 01:21:02,810
Hog incoming.

856
01:21:02,810 --> 01:21:03,369
Get down.

857
01:21:13,220 --> 01:21:14,420
I'm main ball.

858
01:21:15,300 --> 01:21:19,800
Oh, I'm this ball.

859
01:21:19,880 --> 01:21:20,439
Can I shoot through?

860
01:21:20,439 --> 01:21:21,960
I can't get off of it.

861
01:21:29,560 --> 01:21:30,439
What does this do for us?

862
01:21:32,649 --> 01:21:33,449
No, you need to pull that.

863
01:21:33,449 --> 01:21:34,329
Ah, yeah.

864
01:21:35,130 --> 01:21:36,649
Oh my God, the brain.

865
01:21:37,529 --> 01:21:38,489
You didn't say to do that.

866
01:21:43,029 --> 01:21:44,789
He was complimenting my brain.

867
01:21:44,789 --> 01:21:46,069
I was complimenting Jeremiah.

868
01:21:46,069 --> 01:21:48,310
I think he is much smarter than anyone gives him credit for.

869
01:21:50,470 --> 01:21:53,909
Who else would tell other people to spit a drink so that they could drink it?

870
01:21:56,789 --> 01:21:57,510
We need to get there.

871
01:21:58,470 --> 01:22:03,560
Yeah, because I wanted to have it completely in frame the whole time.

872
01:22:03,560 --> 01:22:05,560
Like that soda does not move.

873
01:22:06,439 --> 01:22:09,779
I think if you don't do it now after you describe it, that makes you a coward.

874
01:22:09,779 --> 01:22:10,739
Like there's no...

875
01:22:10,739 --> 01:22:11,939
Guys, there's all kinds of shit up here.

876
01:22:12,659 --> 01:22:13,979
Yeah, are you getting it?

877
01:22:14,619 --> 01:22:15,819
You guys have to get up here.

878
01:22:15,819 --> 01:22:19,100
There's like all this light and bouncing and spinning and...

879
01:22:20,060 --> 01:22:26,890
I need Steve to stop that.

880
01:22:27,449 --> 01:22:35,000
Every time I think you're going to grab something, you grab the opposite item.

881
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:36,600
That would be disgusting.

882
01:22:40,899 --> 01:22:41,539
Hold on.

883
01:22:41,539 --> 01:22:44,979
Jerma is on weapons-grade laxatives right now.

884
01:22:46,020 --> 01:22:46,520
Jump up.

885
01:22:47,140 --> 01:22:47,640
What?

886
01:22:50,859 --> 01:22:52,300
Steve?

887
01:22:53,239 --> 01:22:53,880
What's going on?

888
01:22:53,880 --> 01:22:55,000
What are you guys doing?

889
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:55,479
I can't...

890
01:22:55,479 --> 01:22:55,979
Oh.

891
01:22:56,680 --> 01:22:57,960
Me jump.

892
01:22:57,960 --> 01:22:58,760
God damn it.

893
01:22:59,479 --> 01:23:00,439
We're such fucking...

894
01:23:00,439 --> 01:23:00,760
Get on.

895
01:23:00,760 --> 01:23:01,399
I can't move.

896
01:23:01,399 --> 01:23:02,039
Me jump.

897
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:08,439
All right, now let me...

898
01:23:09,750 --> 01:23:11,189
All right, I'm holding it.

899
01:23:11,829 --> 01:23:12,949
Oh God, that helps.

900
01:23:14,340 --> 01:23:14,840
Star?

901
01:23:16,300 --> 01:23:16,939
We're good.

902
01:23:16,939 --> 01:23:17,340
We're good.

903
01:23:17,340 --> 01:23:18,539
We just had a moment.

904
01:23:18,539 --> 01:23:19,659
Just look at all this stuff in here.

905
01:23:19,659 --> 01:23:21,100
There's like a key in there and shit.

906
01:23:21,899 --> 01:23:24,260
Whoa, what does that do?

907
01:23:26,600 --> 01:23:28,920
Well, it causes the light to be black, so you have to grab this thing.

908
01:23:31,020 --> 01:23:31,579
And then I think...

909
01:23:31,579 --> 01:23:32,380
Nope.

910
01:23:32,380 --> 01:23:32,880
Yeah.

911
01:23:34,100 --> 01:23:34,739
Nope.

912
01:23:34,739 --> 01:23:36,229
I'll hold it the other...

913
01:23:37,109 --> 01:23:37,670
I'm holding it.

914
01:23:39,689 --> 01:23:40,890
It's pulling me.

915
01:23:40,890 --> 01:23:41,770
Wait, I have to attach it.

916
01:23:42,739 --> 01:23:43,239
Got it.

917
01:23:45,739 --> 01:23:48,119
No, that's not how it...

918
01:23:48,119 --> 01:23:49,159
Why is that not working?

919
01:23:49,159 --> 01:23:50,359
Why did it get longer?

920
01:23:50,920 --> 01:23:51,420
There we go.

921
01:23:52,119 --> 01:23:52,840
Whatever.

922
01:23:52,840 --> 01:23:53,340
What's in there?

923
01:23:54,060 --> 01:23:55,500
I found a part of my door.

924
01:23:56,380 --> 01:24:00,760
The whole quest was for home improvement.

925
01:24:00,760 --> 01:24:01,399
We got points.

926
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:03,640
I got a skill.

927
01:24:03,640 --> 01:24:04,279
Did you get a skill?

928
01:24:04,279 --> 01:24:05,960
The rest is Prince and then redo his house.

929
01:24:05,960 --> 01:24:07,079
Oh yeah, we got skills!

930
01:24:07,079 --> 01:24:07,800
That's what I...

931
01:24:07,800 --> 01:24:09,319
And that was a smart thing.

932
01:24:12,170 --> 01:24:13,369
I don't want this skill.

933
01:24:13,369 --> 01:24:14,489
That skill's dumb.

934
01:24:14,489 --> 01:24:16,170
I don't want to upgrade the other people.

935
01:24:16,170 --> 01:24:16,970
I want to upgrade me.

936
01:24:19,289 --> 01:24:20,489
Yeah, I want to upgrade me too.

937
01:24:21,130 --> 01:24:22,329
I don't want to just upgrade somebody.

938
01:24:22,329 --> 01:24:23,529
Fuck you guys.

939
01:24:23,529 --> 01:24:24,649
I don't want that skill.

940
01:24:26,170 --> 01:24:27,289
I think you just like...

941
01:24:28,329 --> 01:24:30,569
There's like five skills in these trees.

942
01:24:30,569 --> 01:24:31,930
I think you just take them.

943
01:24:31,930 --> 01:24:32,329
All right.

944
01:24:32,329 --> 01:24:33,289
No, I want to...

945
01:24:33,289 --> 01:24:34,409
I don't want that skill.

946
01:24:35,449 --> 01:24:38,859
I know, I'm just...

947
01:24:38,859 --> 01:24:39,659
I was doing my parts.

948
01:24:48,989 --> 01:24:49,489
It'll move it.

949
01:24:50,510 --> 01:24:51,149
Just give it some...

950
01:24:51,149 --> 01:24:51,869
Just give it some time.

951
01:24:54,270 --> 01:24:55,130
Give it a minute.

952
01:24:55,850 --> 01:24:57,020
There it goes.

953
01:24:57,819 --> 01:25:05,579
Does anybody else feel like they've been on this first level for like three hours?

954
01:25:06,380 --> 01:25:07,979
This is not the first level.

955
01:25:07,979 --> 01:25:09,420
Well, I mean like the first real level.

956
01:25:10,460 --> 01:25:11,739
That was last level.

957
01:25:11,739 --> 01:25:13,340
Oh wait, let him stand on it.

958
01:25:13,979 --> 01:25:19,600
The bird?

959
01:25:19,600 --> 01:25:20,640
You're being kind of stupid.

960
01:25:21,529 --> 01:25:22,170
No offense.

961
01:25:22,170 --> 01:25:22,810
I think he just...

962
01:25:22,810 --> 01:25:23,369
Yeah, just jump.

963
01:25:27,739 --> 01:25:29,420
You didn't even held it with arrows?

964
01:25:30,399 --> 01:25:32,479
I knocked one arrow over there.

965
01:25:33,119 --> 01:25:33,840
Like...

966
01:25:33,840 --> 01:25:34,720
Well, that's so funny.

967
01:25:38,460 --> 01:25:41,310
I wanted the bird to do a reaction video.

968
01:25:44,439 --> 01:25:46,119
Massive bird!

969
01:25:46,119 --> 01:25:47,640
A reaction video.

970
01:25:48,840 --> 01:25:51,159
Have you been watching reaction videos?

971
01:25:51,159 --> 01:25:52,439
You keep bringing them up.

972
01:25:52,439 --> 01:25:52,680
No.

973
01:25:53,319 --> 01:25:56,680
That usually indicates that you're secretly watching them and are guilty about it.

974
01:25:56,680 --> 01:25:58,760
I'm not this linear of a character, Ashley.

975
01:25:59,880 --> 01:26:00,520
You are though.

976
01:26:02,119 --> 01:26:03,000
Am I hurting my back?

977
01:26:03,880 --> 01:26:05,079
Jeremy, you gotta go get this.

978
01:26:05,720 --> 01:26:05,960
Yep.

979
01:26:07,609 --> 01:26:09,130
I weigh like 300 pounds.

980
01:26:09,130 --> 01:26:11,130
You can't expect me to do things like this.

981
01:26:16,829 --> 01:26:18,989
Whoa, he lived for...

982
01:26:18,989 --> 01:26:21,149
Well, I jumped too early.

983
01:26:21,149 --> 01:26:21,789
Too late to me.

984
01:26:21,789 --> 01:26:23,069
Oh, he got the credit for living.

985
01:26:23,710 --> 01:26:26,350
Hey, by the way, speaking of like the react videos,

986
01:26:26,350 --> 01:26:28,430
I saw your like Star React stream.

987
01:26:29,310 --> 01:26:30,270
I know, you were there.

988
01:26:30,909 --> 01:26:31,550
It was pretty good.

989
01:26:32,829 --> 01:26:34,109
What would you rate it out of ten?

990
01:26:35,069 --> 01:26:35,310
Four.

991
01:26:36,510 --> 01:26:37,789
Four out of ten.

992
01:26:37,789 --> 01:26:39,470
Wow, that's better than usual.

993
01:26:41,630 --> 01:26:41,949
No.

994
01:26:43,710 --> 01:26:44,829
Four out of ten.

995
01:26:44,829 --> 01:26:46,829
No, it was like an eight and a half.

996
01:26:47,949 --> 01:26:50,920
What would have made it a ten, in your opinion, if you took your shirt off?

997
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:53,819
Maybe like a...

998
01:27:00,760 --> 01:27:01,399
Less music.

999
01:27:04,729 --> 01:27:06,170
Jazz, you're not a fan of the jazz?

1000
01:27:07,050 --> 01:27:07,930
No music.

1001
01:27:07,930 --> 01:27:08,489
Durn it all.

1002
01:27:12,380 --> 01:27:12,859
I got him.

1003
01:27:12,859 --> 01:27:13,340
We can go.

1004
01:27:20,680 --> 01:27:21,159
Found him.

1005
01:27:21,159 --> 01:27:21,960
He's here.

1006
01:27:21,960 --> 01:27:22,279
Wow.

1007
01:27:22,279 --> 01:27:22,760
Get him over here.

1008
01:27:22,760 --> 01:27:24,989
You must be the prince we're looking for.

1009
01:27:24,989 --> 01:27:26,270
Good thing too.

1010
01:27:26,270 --> 01:27:27,310
I was afraid you'd been eaten by wolves.

1011
01:27:27,310 --> 01:27:28,350
We missed Bloods.

1012
01:27:28,350 --> 01:27:29,149
I'm being rushed.

1013
01:27:29,949 --> 01:27:31,149
What do you want with me?

1014
01:27:32,250 --> 01:27:34,649
We're taking you to the safety of the Astral Academy.

1015
01:27:35,449 --> 01:27:36,090
What?

1016
01:27:36,090 --> 01:27:37,609
I'm not going back there.

1017
01:27:37,609 --> 01:27:39,899
You think we'd leave you alone in the middle of...

1018
01:27:39,899 --> 01:27:40,539
We're here.

1019
01:27:41,260 --> 01:27:44,380
Look, I don't care if you're a prince or a pig keeper.

1020
01:27:44,380 --> 01:27:45,180
You're coming with us.

1021
01:27:45,819 --> 01:27:48,060
I'm not a child to be told what to do.

1022
01:27:48,859 --> 01:27:49,420
Red eyes.

1023
01:27:50,460 --> 01:27:52,119
Okay, so the next cutscene we have,

1024
01:27:53,159 --> 01:27:55,720
we have to mute the whole game.

1025
01:27:55,720 --> 01:27:57,000
And then each of our characters,

1026
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,399
each one of us has to do the dialogue on the bottom of the screen.

1027
01:28:02,430 --> 01:28:03,069
Am I muted?

1028
01:28:03,069 --> 01:28:03,310
Okay.

1029
01:28:04,029 --> 01:28:04,750
Yeah, no, okay.

1030
01:28:06,590 --> 01:28:10,039
You have to turn subtitles on.

1031
01:28:10,600 --> 01:28:12,520
Yeah, turn subtitles on and then...

1032
01:28:12,520 --> 01:28:13,239
Oh, hold on.

1033
01:28:15,609 --> 01:28:16,409
It's like a giant.

1034
01:28:17,689 --> 01:28:19,210
Why can't I fucking move?

1035
01:28:19,369 --> 01:28:25,069
Oh, why does this happen?

1036
01:28:25,069 --> 01:28:29,100
There's a wolf eating you.

1037
01:28:31,180 --> 01:28:31,420
Okay.

1038
01:28:33,630 --> 01:28:35,550
I clicked in the window like five times.

1039
01:28:36,670 --> 01:28:37,470
You got a rhizome.

1040
01:28:38,270 --> 01:28:38,829
I do.

1041
01:28:41,500 --> 01:28:42,859
I don't know why this does this.

1042
01:28:44,720 --> 01:28:46,880
Exclusive window, except I clicked in it.

1043
01:28:54,750 --> 01:28:57,149
I'm dead.

1044
01:28:58,350 --> 01:28:58,909
No, you're not.

1045
01:29:01,560 --> 01:29:13,949
Oh, a giant nightmare wolf.

1046
01:29:17,239 --> 01:29:19,079
That really is literally its name.

1047
01:29:19,880 --> 01:29:21,319
Giant nightmare wolf.

1048
01:29:21,319 --> 01:29:21,800
That's our...

1049
01:29:23,079 --> 01:29:24,359
Not the one, a one.

1050
01:29:25,239 --> 01:29:28,829
Oh, I should have blocked that.

1051
01:29:30,350 --> 01:29:33,899
Harder than stiff.

1052
01:29:33,899 --> 01:29:34,140
Yeah.

1053
01:29:35,180 --> 01:29:35,739
Almost dead.

1054
01:29:52,270 --> 01:29:52,909
This doesn't count.

1055
01:29:53,710 --> 01:29:56,989
Uh, I say we knock him unconscious and carry him back to the Astral Academy.

1056
01:29:58,729 --> 01:30:02,409
Um, Ashley, how come you didn't run up to the prince and drive your sword through his chest?

1057
01:30:03,210 --> 01:30:05,289
I did, but the cutscene lagging in place.

1058
01:30:06,729 --> 01:30:07,130
Hello?

1059
01:30:08,250 --> 01:30:08,489
What?

1060
01:30:11,789 --> 01:30:12,510
In my mind, I did.

1061
01:30:14,479 --> 01:30:15,279
All right, everybody.

1062
01:30:16,720 --> 01:30:19,600
For a second, just quickly, can we hit start?

1063
01:30:19,600 --> 01:30:20,000
All of you.

1064
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:21,520
Go to options.

1065
01:30:22,079 --> 01:30:22,560
Just hit start.

1066
01:30:22,560 --> 01:30:23,119
Go to options.

1067
01:30:23,920 --> 01:30:25,840
Go to dialogue.

1068
01:30:25,840 --> 01:30:27,039
Bring dialogue to zero.

1069
01:30:28,079 --> 01:30:29,199
And then, uh, confirm.

1070
01:30:30,720 --> 01:30:34,199
Because the next cutscene, we're going to do our characters.

1071
01:30:34,760 --> 01:30:35,159
Voices.

1072
01:30:35,720 --> 01:30:36,039
Okay.

1073
01:30:36,920 --> 01:30:37,239
Okay.

1074
01:30:50,399 --> 01:30:51,760
I can't wait for this to happen, though.

1075
01:30:54,159 --> 01:30:55,279
I meet one, by the way.

1076
01:30:56,159 --> 01:30:58,270
You just do meet one.

1077
01:30:58,909 --> 01:31:00,670
I mean, I'm a bad impression of meet one.

1078
01:31:00,670 --> 01:31:01,789
That's what it is.

1079
01:31:01,789 --> 01:31:02,989
What's with the snapping?

1080
01:31:02,989 --> 01:31:03,470
Look at this.

1081
01:31:03,470 --> 01:31:03,789
Come on.

1082
01:31:05,949 --> 01:31:10,640
Wait, hold on.

1083
01:31:10,640 --> 01:31:13,119
Everyone was just on board with this 15 seconds ago.

1084
01:31:13,119 --> 01:31:13,920
And all of a sudden, I hit...

1085
01:31:13,920 --> 01:31:15,520
I go in the options and actually turn it off.

1086
01:31:15,520 --> 01:31:17,119
And now we're not on board with it anymore?

1087
01:31:17,680 --> 01:31:18,159
We're on board.

1088
01:31:18,159 --> 01:31:18,880
What are you talking about?

1089
01:31:18,880 --> 01:31:21,119
No, I'm talking about the fucking crowd.

1090
01:31:22,560 --> 01:31:24,239
Oh, the crowd doesn't want this?

1091
01:31:24,960 --> 01:31:25,520
Cringe.

1092
01:31:26,720 --> 01:31:27,760
Cringe, dude.

1093
01:31:28,880 --> 01:31:32,560
You're going to pretend to be a cringe, dude.

1094
01:31:32,560 --> 01:31:33,439
That's so cringe.

1095
01:31:34,399 --> 01:31:35,199
What the fuck?

1096
01:31:38,250 --> 01:31:38,569
I don't...

1097
01:31:42,029 --> 01:31:44,909
Do I attach to this and then attach to that?

1098
01:31:46,159 --> 01:31:48,159
Uh, go up there and push the top one in.

1099
01:31:49,119 --> 01:31:50,729
To the top right.

1100
01:31:51,369 --> 01:31:51,930
Can I just...

1101
01:31:51,930 --> 01:31:53,050
I don't think I can do that.

1102
01:31:53,050 --> 01:31:54,329
Jump on top of this box.

1103
01:31:58,079 --> 01:31:59,579
I mean, I can't...

1104
01:31:59,579 --> 01:32:00,859
Oh, but you can just grab it.

1105
01:32:01,979 --> 01:32:05,739
All right, I'm picking one of them.

1106
01:32:06,460 --> 01:32:08,380
Can you shoot the top one?

1107
01:32:08,380 --> 01:32:10,680
Wow.

1108
01:32:10,680 --> 01:32:12,670
Oh, that worked.

1109
01:32:12,670 --> 01:32:14,800
Whoa.

1110
01:32:14,800 --> 01:32:15,520
Uh-oh, uh-oh.

1111
01:32:16,239 --> 01:32:23,050
Well, now I'm never noticing when the characters talk.

1112
01:32:23,930 --> 01:32:25,239
Because we turned it off.

1113
01:32:26,600 --> 01:32:26,920
Yeah.

1114
01:32:28,060 --> 01:32:30,619
Well, now it has talked because the subtitles are on.

1115
01:32:31,420 --> 01:32:33,340
Yeah, no, our characters have said things.

1116
01:32:43,039 --> 01:32:44,239
Stars are really watching his performance.

1117
01:32:44,239 --> 01:32:44,800
Wait, wait, wait.

1118
01:32:44,800 --> 01:32:45,279
Oh, no, no, no.

1119
01:32:49,449 --> 01:32:50,409
I have to put it on the wall,

1120
01:32:50,409 --> 01:32:51,689
otherwise we're going to jump forward and die

1121
01:32:51,689 --> 01:32:53,050
and I can't move it because Jerma's on it.

1122
01:32:53,930 --> 01:32:54,489
Well, go for it.

1123
01:32:54,489 --> 01:32:56,090
Now it's roped so I can't move it further.

1124
01:32:57,369 --> 01:32:59,180
But now you got to rope it.

1125
01:32:59,819 --> 01:33:00,600
There you go.

1126
01:33:09,710 --> 01:33:10,029
Uh-oh.

1127
01:33:10,840 --> 01:33:11,239
Bugs.

1128
01:33:12,199 --> 01:33:13,479
The nightmare spider.

1129
01:33:19,449 --> 01:33:21,050
As I feel, I do more damage than you.

1130
01:33:22,010 --> 01:33:22,409
Than me?

1131
01:33:23,130 --> 01:33:24,090
Than Ashley.

1132
01:33:24,329 --> 01:33:24,970
You're the wizard.

1133
01:33:24,970 --> 01:33:26,569
The wizard can get nerfed like 10 times.

1134
01:33:28,489 --> 01:33:29,689
Cringe spider.

1135
01:33:30,329 --> 01:33:31,609
See, your character's talking.

1136
01:33:32,489 --> 01:33:33,050
The wizards.

1137
01:33:33,930 --> 01:33:34,890
No, no, no, this doesn't count.

1138
01:33:35,529 --> 01:33:36,649
No, it doesn't count.

1139
01:33:36,649 --> 01:33:37,930
Okay, it doesn't count.

1140
01:33:37,930 --> 01:33:39,529
It has to be in a cut scene.

1141
01:33:39,529 --> 01:33:40,489
All right, we'll turn it back on.

1142
01:33:42,170 --> 01:33:42,810
You gave up?

1143
01:33:43,689 --> 01:33:44,409
Well, just into...

1144
01:33:44,409 --> 01:33:46,409
Wait, once we get to the end of the level, turn it off.

1145
01:33:47,289 --> 01:33:48,250
This is going to be like...

1146
01:33:48,250 --> 01:33:51,529
Always these gigantic $20,000 schemes.

1147
01:33:51,529 --> 01:33:52,409
Fire arrows?

1148
01:33:52,409 --> 01:33:53,529
What the fuck?

1149
01:33:57,899 --> 01:34:00,460
Holy shit, I'm way cooler than everybody in this game now.

1150
01:34:01,100 --> 01:34:03,050
How'd you get fired?

1151
01:34:04,170 --> 01:34:05,210
They just gave it to me.

1152
01:34:05,210 --> 01:34:06,409
No, I just gave it to them, dude.

1153
01:34:06,409 --> 01:34:07,529
They just gave it to them.

1154
01:34:07,529 --> 01:34:09,449
Ice arrows to freeze the rotating pla...

1155
01:34:09,449 --> 01:34:10,729
Oh my god, they're just giving it to them.

1156
01:34:11,930 --> 01:34:12,729
This is so cool.

1157
01:34:13,609 --> 01:34:15,130
Freeze the platform.

1158
01:34:15,130 --> 01:34:16,170
So I think you have to get off it.

1159
01:34:16,890 --> 01:34:19,850
Because I have to freeze it, right?

1160
01:34:19,850 --> 01:34:20,329
So it needs to...

1161
01:34:21,500 --> 01:34:21,979
Huh.

1162
01:34:21,979 --> 01:34:22,460
Yeah, get off.

1163
01:34:22,460 --> 01:34:22,859
Get off it.

1164
01:34:22,859 --> 01:34:24,699
Watch out with your noodly wizard arms.

1165
01:34:24,699 --> 01:34:25,739
Now I go like this.

1166
01:34:25,739 --> 01:34:26,619
And it's frozen.

1167
01:34:26,619 --> 01:34:27,819
And now we can get up there.

1168
01:34:29,229 --> 01:34:30,109
I don't know why it wasn't...

1169
01:34:32,430 --> 01:34:33,229
Is it...

1170
01:34:33,229 --> 01:34:34,829
I can't get my box through.

1171
01:34:34,829 --> 01:34:35,310
Hold on.

1172
01:34:36,270 --> 01:34:39,869
Oh, shit.

1173
01:34:41,390 --> 01:34:43,149
Ah, shit.

1174
01:34:43,149 --> 01:34:44,590
Well, it's frozen, so we can do that now.

1175
01:34:45,149 --> 01:34:46,829
Just need a box or something around.

1176
01:34:49,500 --> 01:34:52,699
I don't like that Jerma's character is going to be doing things.

1177
01:34:53,739 --> 01:34:54,779
No, I know.

1178
01:34:54,779 --> 01:34:55,739
What a disaster.

1179
01:35:04,250 --> 01:35:05,369
He has to freeze them.

1180
01:35:06,569 --> 01:35:07,369
Come on.

1181
01:35:07,369 --> 01:35:09,210
Oh, one at a time.

1182
01:35:09,210 --> 01:35:09,930
One at a time.

1183
01:35:11,130 --> 01:35:11,630
Yeah.

1184
01:35:14,159 --> 01:35:15,359
Just stay on the first one.

1185
01:35:17,390 --> 01:35:17,710
And then...

1186
01:35:18,989 --> 01:35:19,470
Yeah.

1187
01:35:19,470 --> 01:35:20,510
Like, I mean, I can...

1188
01:35:20,510 --> 01:35:20,989
Like...

1189
01:35:20,989 --> 01:35:22,250
Yeah, just...

1190
01:35:22,250 --> 01:35:23,529
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1191
01:35:23,529 --> 01:35:24,569
Well, let me at least get on here.

1192
01:35:25,920 --> 01:35:26,800
Yeah, you can just make the jump.

1193
01:35:27,739 --> 01:35:28,460
You don't have to do that.

1194
01:35:29,609 --> 01:35:30,649
You can just make it.

1195
01:35:30,649 --> 01:35:31,930
Just stand on that one for a second.

1196
01:35:31,930 --> 01:35:32,729
And, yeah.

1197
01:35:32,729 --> 01:35:33,609
No, just stay...

1198
01:35:33,609 --> 01:35:35,770
Just let him do it his own way, Jerma.

1199
01:35:37,689 --> 01:35:38,409
Hold on.

1200
01:35:38,409 --> 01:35:39,689
I'm sorry.

1201
01:35:39,689 --> 01:35:41,130
You don't have to control your friends.

1202
01:35:41,130 --> 01:35:41,850
I'm sorry.

1203
01:35:42,729 --> 01:35:45,689
If I want to do something a different way, I get like...

1204
01:35:45,689 --> 01:35:46,250
Jerma!

1205
01:35:46,250 --> 01:35:46,729
Jerma!

1206
01:35:46,729 --> 01:35:47,289
Jerma!

1207
01:35:47,289 --> 01:35:47,689
Jerma!

1208
01:35:47,689 --> 01:35:48,329
What are you doing?

1209
01:35:48,329 --> 01:35:48,729
Jerma!

1210
01:35:49,979 --> 01:35:51,020
Jerma, get over here!

1211
01:35:51,020 --> 01:35:51,899
That's what we sound like.

1212
01:35:53,079 --> 01:35:54,439
We sound like bugs.

1213
01:35:54,439 --> 01:35:55,800
That's what he thinks we sound like.

1214
01:35:56,439 --> 01:35:56,939
Jerma!

1215
01:35:58,760 --> 01:35:59,079
Jerma!

1216
01:35:59,079 --> 01:35:59,319
Hey!

1217
01:35:59,319 --> 01:35:59,560
Whoa!

1218
01:35:59,560 --> 01:35:59,720
Hey!

1219
01:35:59,720 --> 01:36:00,199
What are you doing?

1220
01:36:00,199 --> 01:36:00,600
Hey!

1221
01:36:00,600 --> 01:36:01,000
That's right!

1222
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:01,640
Wait!

1223
01:36:01,640 --> 01:36:02,199
Come on now!

1224
01:36:02,199 --> 01:36:02,520
Whoa!

1225
01:36:02,520 --> 01:36:02,760
Hey!

1226
01:36:04,680 --> 01:36:06,039
You guys are fucking Beetlejuice!

1227
01:36:16,640 --> 01:36:17,439
He said it once.

1228
01:36:24,239 --> 01:36:24,880
No!

1229
01:36:24,880 --> 01:36:26,909
I'm still alive!

1230
01:36:26,909 --> 01:36:27,390
I can't get it?

1231
01:36:31,550 --> 01:36:31,949
Yeah, I get it.

1232
01:36:31,949 --> 01:36:32,350
There you go.

1233
01:36:35,819 --> 01:36:36,619
We don't go this way.

1234
01:36:38,649 --> 01:36:39,449
We have to go this way.

1235
01:36:39,609 --> 01:36:40,010
Great.

1236
01:36:43,800 --> 01:36:45,239
Nice fucking bottle!

1237
01:36:46,600 --> 01:36:48,119
Why did I read that?

1238
01:36:48,119 --> 01:36:48,840
What?

1239
01:36:48,840 --> 01:36:49,800
Get in here!

1240
01:36:49,800 --> 01:36:50,279
I can't.

1241
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:51,960
Yeah, you can.

1242
01:36:51,960 --> 01:36:53,399
What are you talking about?

1243
01:36:53,399 --> 01:36:55,640
I didn't realize what part of the movie that is.

1244
01:36:58,409 --> 01:36:59,130
Oh, shit!

1245
01:37:00,170 --> 01:37:00,970
Oh, shit!

1246
01:37:02,729 --> 01:37:04,569
Jerma, you're not doing the joke at all.

1247
01:37:04,569 --> 01:37:05,529
No, you don't.

1248
01:37:05,529 --> 01:37:06,329
Something else happened.

1249
01:37:06,970 --> 01:37:08,329
There's something else a little more...

1250
01:37:10,170 --> 01:37:12,090
I saw honk in the chat.

1251
01:37:12,649 --> 01:37:14,890
And I was gonna move on from that one.

1252
01:37:20,520 --> 01:37:21,479
There's things up there.

1253
01:37:22,600 --> 01:37:23,720
Every time you go like,

1254
01:37:23,720 --> 01:37:26,199
Oh, Jerma, I think you have like a bathroom problem.

1255
01:37:27,079 --> 01:37:28,279
Well, same.

1256
01:37:28,279 --> 01:37:28,760
We worry.

1257
01:37:29,399 --> 01:37:30,439
We worry about you.

1258
01:37:30,439 --> 01:37:31,399
Do you know that I...

1259
01:37:31,399 --> 01:37:34,680
You do realize that I'm on like an actual prescription grid laxative right now.

1260
01:37:34,680 --> 01:37:35,319
You know that, right?

1261
01:37:35,319 --> 01:37:36,199
That's not a joke.

1262
01:37:36,199 --> 01:37:37,720
Oh, no, it's not a joke.

1263
01:37:39,079 --> 01:37:40,279
Every time you show concern.

1264
01:37:41,640 --> 01:37:42,520
Where my thoughts go.

1265
01:37:42,600 --> 01:37:44,439
He's on a weapons grade laxative.

1266
01:37:45,560 --> 01:37:48,060
Oh, I froze it.

1267
01:37:49,279 --> 01:37:50,159
Skill point coming up.

1268
01:37:50,159 --> 01:37:51,199
Can I freeze your box?

1269
01:37:51,920 --> 01:37:52,800
I don't think so.

1270
01:37:52,800 --> 01:37:53,300
Oh.

1271
01:37:55,680 --> 01:37:56,560
How are we supposed to do that?

1272
01:37:59,760 --> 01:38:00,800
Get off my box.

1273
01:38:00,800 --> 01:38:03,840
You can rope my boxes so I can stick my box up here.

1274
01:38:03,840 --> 01:38:04,340
Oh, shit!

1275
01:38:05,199 --> 01:38:07,119
Oh, I didn't know that was gonna come down.

1276
01:38:07,840 --> 01:38:09,600
Wait, you can stick it there.

1277
01:38:13,850 --> 01:38:15,289
Okay, I can hold it up.

1278
01:38:15,850 --> 01:38:17,609
It might still drop when you wait.

1279
01:38:17,609 --> 01:38:18,649
You waste so much.

1280
01:38:19,289 --> 01:38:20,010
Okay, so then...

1281
01:38:20,890 --> 01:38:21,390
Now what?

1282
01:38:22,010 --> 01:38:23,420
Now nothing.

1283
01:38:23,420 --> 01:38:24,060
This isn't it.

1284
01:38:24,060 --> 01:38:24,699
You gotta get off.

1285
01:38:31,159 --> 01:38:33,479
No, it's not dark web laxative.

1286
01:38:33,479 --> 01:38:33,979
No.

1287
01:38:34,600 --> 01:38:35,800
Can that stay there?

1288
01:38:35,800 --> 01:38:36,439
Now, what if...

1289
01:38:36,439 --> 01:38:37,000
Yeah.

1290
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:37,640
Is there anything I can...

1291
01:38:38,439 --> 01:38:39,239
What about freezing it?

1292
01:38:39,239 --> 01:38:39,880
Can I freeze it?

1293
01:38:40,760 --> 01:38:41,319
No.

1294
01:38:41,319 --> 01:38:42,119
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1295
01:38:42,119 --> 01:38:42,840
I'm talking about this thing.

1296
01:38:42,840 --> 01:38:43,239
The platform?

1297
01:38:43,239 --> 01:38:43,960
Yeah, the platform.

1298
01:38:44,859 --> 01:38:45,420
There you go.

1299
01:38:45,420 --> 01:38:46,939
Okay, now get off of it, Ashley.

1300
01:38:46,939 --> 01:38:48,060
You're ruining it, Ashley.

1301
01:38:49,710 --> 01:38:50,350
Now you got me.

1302
01:38:50,350 --> 01:38:51,229
Now you gotta grapple up.

1303
01:38:53,319 --> 01:38:53,960
Look at you.

1304
01:38:53,960 --> 01:38:54,920
Look at you, man.

1305
01:38:54,920 --> 01:38:55,960
Oh, a blue quill.

1306
01:38:55,960 --> 01:38:57,000
That's what I'm talking about.

1307
01:38:59,949 --> 01:39:00,590
Upgrade point.

1308
01:39:02,189 --> 01:39:06,760
You have two available upgrade points.

1309
01:39:06,760 --> 01:39:07,880
I can upgrade...

1310
01:39:07,880 --> 01:39:09,000
Ooh, what's this?

1311
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:10,039
So many things.

1312
01:39:10,840 --> 01:39:14,279
20 more drops of germa blood before I can get something else.

1313
01:39:15,899 --> 01:39:19,500
So I think you actually have to put points into other characters.

1314
01:39:20,779 --> 01:39:21,579
Have to?

1315
01:39:21,579 --> 01:39:22,619
You don't have to.

1316
01:39:22,619 --> 01:39:23,899
I don't think you have to.

1317
01:39:23,899 --> 01:39:24,460
Well, because...

1318
01:39:25,579 --> 01:39:26,699
Don't let them talk.

1319
01:39:26,699 --> 01:39:27,739
Don't even let them talk.

1320
01:39:27,739 --> 01:39:29,899
The ones that are in squares, you get them as you play.

1321
01:39:30,699 --> 01:39:32,699
The Nightmare Prince is in the background.

1322
01:39:32,699 --> 01:39:33,579
Steve!

1323
01:39:33,579 --> 01:39:34,220
What?

1324
01:39:34,220 --> 01:39:34,939
I need your help.

1325
01:39:34,939 --> 01:39:35,979
No one's listening to me.

1326
01:39:36,779 --> 01:39:37,899
We don't want to hear you.

1327
01:39:37,899 --> 01:39:39,739
Germa, tell us about your day.

1328
01:39:39,739 --> 01:39:42,380
My day was pretty sick.

1329
01:39:44,960 --> 01:39:47,210
I need to... hold on.

1330
01:39:48,170 --> 01:39:53,050
Spiral arrow.

1331
01:39:53,050 --> 01:39:56,619
Spiral arrow.

1332
01:39:56,619 --> 01:39:57,659
Freeze that one real quick.

1333
01:39:58,460 --> 01:40:03,949
Can you guys all get up here?

1334
01:40:05,239 --> 01:40:06,039
Spiral arrow.

1335
01:40:06,039 --> 01:40:06,760
Oh.

1336
01:40:06,760 --> 01:40:08,279
Whoa, did you just get like an illusory wall?

1337
01:40:09,239 --> 01:40:10,279
No, I mean, you couldn't...

1338
01:40:10,279 --> 01:40:11,239
I mean, yeah, sure.

1339
01:40:11,960 --> 01:40:13,000
Whoa.

1340
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:14,279
Let me just freeze that one real quick.

1341
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:16,810
Oh my god, he froze it.

1342
01:40:17,369 --> 01:40:18,010
Oh my god.

1343
01:40:18,810 --> 01:40:19,689
Oh, shit.

1344
01:40:19,689 --> 01:40:20,189
No!

1345
01:40:24,779 --> 01:40:25,659
Can you break through this gate?

1346
01:40:26,619 --> 01:40:28,000
How do we open it?

1347
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:28,319
How would...

1348
01:40:28,319 --> 01:40:28,880
Yeah, there you go.

1349
01:40:29,680 --> 01:40:31,920
And you get the spoils in the middle.

1350
01:40:32,640 --> 01:40:34,909
So spoiled now.

1351
01:40:36,829 --> 01:40:37,949
You never told us about your day.

1352
01:40:37,949 --> 01:40:39,390
I thought you wanted us to listen.

1353
01:40:41,739 --> 01:40:42,220
Wait, hold on.

1354
01:40:42,220 --> 01:40:44,060
Use ice arrows to make ice raft.

1355
01:40:44,859 --> 01:40:45,949
What?

1356
01:40:45,949 --> 01:40:46,510
Ice car.

1357
01:40:48,720 --> 01:40:50,079
Okay, so that's cool.

1358
01:40:50,159 --> 01:40:52,399
How come your character gets to do everything now?

1359
01:40:52,399 --> 01:40:54,239
Because you chose wrong.

1360
01:40:55,279 --> 01:40:57,630
So stick it on there so we can do it right,

1361
01:40:57,630 --> 01:40:58,670
or I'll just jump on it.

1362
01:40:59,630 --> 01:41:01,369
Yeah, you don't even need me anymore

1363
01:41:01,369 --> 01:41:03,689
because you get ice arrows and fire arrows and...

1364
01:41:04,649 --> 01:41:06,729
Yeah, just wait till we get to the wizard level where I can...

1365
01:41:06,729 --> 01:41:09,399
Oh, do the voices.

1366
01:41:09,399 --> 01:41:10,039
No, it's too late.

1367
01:41:10,039 --> 01:41:10,520
It's too late.

1368
01:41:10,520 --> 01:41:11,159
Do the voices.

1369
01:41:12,119 --> 01:41:13,720
Because we don't have an actor.

1370
01:41:13,720 --> 01:41:14,680
He doesn't have a voice.

1371
01:41:16,590 --> 01:41:19,069
The wizard gave you a magic talisman.

1372
01:41:19,069 --> 01:41:19,869
What does it do?

1373
01:41:21,869 --> 01:41:22,510
He doesn't have one.

1374
01:41:24,189 --> 01:41:26,350
You were just the demon inside of that guy's head

1375
01:41:26,350 --> 01:41:27,229
while he was talking.

1376
01:41:27,229 --> 01:41:28,829
You were feeding him blinds.

1377
01:41:28,829 --> 01:41:29,550
That was great.

1378
01:41:29,550 --> 01:41:32,029
That was great that we all collectively did that

1379
01:41:32,029 --> 01:41:33,069
during the next cut scene.

1380
01:41:33,069 --> 01:41:33,789
That was awesome.

1381
01:41:33,789 --> 01:41:34,909
I'm turning my dialogue back on.

1382
01:41:42,170 --> 01:41:44,090
I'm so glad I got to be the wizard to talk.

1383
01:41:44,890 --> 01:41:49,399
Like I said, I got a big one and nobody cared.

1384
01:41:51,289 --> 01:41:52,489
Wow, you got a big one.

1385
01:41:58,590 --> 01:41:59,630
I can actually freeze them.

1386
01:42:01,659 --> 01:42:02,220
Oh, wow.

1387
01:42:02,220 --> 01:42:02,779
Holy shit.

1388
01:42:02,779 --> 01:42:04,300
They made this character awesome.

1389
01:42:04,939 --> 01:42:08,590
You can do everything.

1390
01:42:16,510 --> 01:42:17,949
I call that perfect timing.

1391
01:42:17,949 --> 01:42:18,590
What would you call it?

1392
01:42:20,409 --> 01:42:22,250
If that was one of those like arcade machines

1393
01:42:22,250 --> 01:42:24,409
where you got to wait for the lights to come around the circle

1394
01:42:24,409 --> 01:42:25,930
and then when the light is on the right light,

1395
01:42:25,930 --> 01:42:27,770
then you just go to stop and then you get the prize.

1396
01:42:27,770 --> 01:42:28,810
If you stop it on the light,

1397
01:42:28,810 --> 01:42:30,810
you would have got the prize when you touch the light.

1398
01:42:30,810 --> 01:42:31,609
Yeah, probably.

1399
01:42:32,729 --> 01:42:41,470
I love the warrior's voice.

1400
01:42:41,470 --> 01:42:42,270
It sounds so stupid.

1401
01:42:43,149 --> 01:42:44,699
You can't do better.

1402
01:42:46,010 --> 01:42:46,890
Why would you freeze that?

1403
01:42:46,890 --> 01:42:48,010
Why would you freeze that?

1404
01:42:48,010 --> 01:42:48,890
Unfreeze it now.

1405
01:42:49,609 --> 01:42:50,250
Why would you?

1406
01:42:52,250 --> 01:42:53,529
Jerma's throwing.

1407
01:42:53,529 --> 01:42:54,729
I would like a please.

1408
01:42:57,520 --> 01:42:59,439
Jerma's throwing?

1409
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:01,439
I shot an arrow at a thing.

1410
01:43:01,439 --> 01:43:02,479
Oh, man.

1411
01:43:02,479 --> 01:43:05,920
You may as well have walked into the tower six times.

1412
01:43:05,920 --> 01:43:22,329
Who even knows what that puzzle was?

1413
01:43:22,329 --> 01:43:23,050
Who even knows?

1414
01:43:35,100 --> 01:43:35,600
Uh-oh.

1415
01:43:36,619 --> 01:43:41,649
Geiso.

1416
01:43:42,270 --> 01:43:53,770
Cool.

1417
01:43:53,770 --> 01:43:55,289
So where does this need to be frozen?

1418
01:43:56,920 --> 01:43:57,960
Or is it just a...

1419
01:43:57,960 --> 01:43:58,460
Hold on.

1420
01:43:59,239 --> 01:44:00,439
I think it's a butt pounder.

1421
01:44:00,439 --> 01:44:01,319
Is it a butt pounder?

1422
01:44:01,319 --> 01:44:02,760
Oh, we got to touch a thing out here.

1423
01:44:05,789 --> 01:44:06,590
Oh, okay.

1424
01:44:06,590 --> 01:44:07,069
Throw me up.

1425
01:44:07,869 --> 01:44:12,880
Okay, active.

1426
01:44:12,880 --> 01:44:14,880
And then that's a butt pounder.

1427
01:44:17,920 --> 01:44:18,880
But then how do you get up?

1428
01:44:19,520 --> 01:44:20,899
I don't know.

1429
01:44:25,819 --> 01:44:27,340
I think that is how you get up.

1430
01:44:27,340 --> 01:44:27,979
Yeah, okay.

1431
01:44:27,979 --> 01:44:28,619
So you get...

1432
01:44:28,619 --> 01:44:29,659
Is that working?

1433
01:44:29,659 --> 01:44:30,220
It should.

1434
01:44:30,220 --> 01:44:30,720
Kind of.

1435
01:44:31,579 --> 01:44:32,079
Whoa.

1436
01:44:33,020 --> 01:44:33,979
Try to...

1437
01:44:33,979 --> 01:44:35,260
Can you do it further away?

1438
01:44:35,260 --> 01:44:35,760
Yeah.

1439
01:44:37,920 --> 01:44:38,880
Yeah, there we go.

1440
01:44:40,430 --> 01:44:41,149
Dude, look at us.

1441
01:44:41,149 --> 01:44:42,189
The three triners.

1442
01:44:42,909 --> 01:44:45,399
Oh, hey, I got this.

1443
01:44:48,189 --> 01:44:49,869
Wow, you're so useless, Steve.

1444
01:44:49,869 --> 01:44:51,229
Wow, my character.

1445
01:44:51,229 --> 01:44:52,350
Fuck you with your ice.

1446
01:44:52,350 --> 01:44:53,630
It's supposed to be my job.

1447
01:44:54,590 --> 01:44:55,149
Not anymore.

1448
01:44:55,710 --> 01:44:57,470
You're not even nice with your...

1449
01:44:57,470 --> 01:44:57,789
Hold on.

1450
01:44:57,789 --> 01:44:59,229
There's something over there on the left.

1451
01:45:00,109 --> 01:45:02,079
Over that way.

1452
01:45:05,369 --> 01:45:06,670
Yep, secret.

1453
01:45:07,470 --> 01:45:09,899
Wow, and only you can unlock it, Jerome.

1454
01:45:13,199 --> 01:45:14,319
Stop throwing that in here.

1455
01:45:14,319 --> 01:45:14,880
I need to...

1456
01:45:15,920 --> 01:45:17,279
I think that actually helped somehow.

1457
01:45:17,920 --> 01:45:19,180
I think so, too.

1458
01:45:20,060 --> 01:45:20,619
Get me out.

1459
01:45:21,420 --> 01:45:22,380
Go up around.

1460
01:45:22,380 --> 01:45:22,699
And then...

1461
01:45:23,819 --> 01:45:24,619
Now I'll pull you in.

1462
01:45:27,819 --> 01:45:28,319
Nope.

1463
01:45:29,079 --> 01:45:29,720
What?

1464
01:45:29,720 --> 01:45:31,310
You gotta walk all the way to the right.

1465
01:45:31,310 --> 01:45:32,189
Okay, yeah, you go.

1466
01:45:32,189 --> 01:45:32,689
Okay.

1467
01:45:33,390 --> 01:45:33,890
Okay.

1468
01:45:34,670 --> 01:45:35,170
Big brain.

1469
01:45:37,020 --> 01:45:38,300
Not even an ice wizard.

1470
01:45:40,489 --> 01:45:42,010
That's very humiliating for him.

1471
01:45:43,050 --> 01:45:45,369
My favorite wizard is ball lightning.

1472
01:45:45,369 --> 01:45:46,250
I'm a wizard.

1473
01:45:46,250 --> 01:45:47,130
You're not a lightning wizard either.

1474
01:45:47,130 --> 01:45:48,090
I am lightning.

1475
01:45:48,090 --> 01:45:49,930
I'm ice and fire wizard.

1476
01:45:49,930 --> 01:45:51,770
You're just guy that can pick stuff up...

1477
01:45:52,489 --> 01:45:53,050
Up ground.

1478
01:45:54,010 --> 01:45:55,050
I make box.

1479
01:46:00,189 --> 01:46:01,630
Yeah, make one of my box now.

1480
01:46:02,350 --> 01:46:03,069
Well, I just...

1481
01:46:03,069 --> 01:46:03,869
I did.

1482
01:46:03,869 --> 01:46:06,029
Because now we need your box to hold that down.

1483
01:46:06,670 --> 01:46:08,319
Do you see what's happening here?

1484
01:46:09,039 --> 01:46:10,600
You need your box in there.

1485
01:46:11,640 --> 01:46:12,760
So then she can get in.

1486
01:46:14,270 --> 01:46:14,989
Wow.

1487
01:46:14,989 --> 01:46:15,630
Box guy.

1488
01:46:15,630 --> 01:46:17,149
Hey, take it from an ice wizard.

1489
01:46:17,869 --> 01:46:19,770
Oh, wow.

1490
01:46:19,770 --> 01:46:20,329
Thanks, Jerome.

1491
01:46:20,329 --> 01:46:20,890
That was cool.

1492
01:46:23,130 --> 01:46:26,600
Remember that time you gave me your sandwich?

1493
01:46:27,720 --> 01:46:30,840
Princelius, why are your wolves and spiders attacking us?

1494
01:46:30,840 --> 01:46:32,119
Do you really want us dead?

1495
01:46:32,119 --> 01:46:32,600
No, I don't.

1496
01:46:33,479 --> 01:46:35,640
Nightmash just appear on their own.

1497
01:46:35,640 --> 01:46:36,970
I control them.

1498
01:46:36,970 --> 01:46:38,829
That's we lost it.

1499
01:46:42,010 --> 01:46:42,970
Satan.

1500
01:46:42,970 --> 01:46:44,090
Reading for the character.

1501
01:46:46,520 --> 01:46:47,720
Satan's audition tape.

1502
01:46:48,439 --> 01:46:49,399
We're trying for...

1503
01:46:50,279 --> 01:46:57,609
I am Asmodeus, wizard.

1504
01:47:00,460 --> 01:47:01,020
Sorry, Satan.

1505
01:47:01,020 --> 01:47:04,060
We think we're going in a more lighthearted direction with this one.

1506
01:47:05,020 --> 01:47:08,359
Okay, I'm a better wizard than you,

1507
01:47:08,359 --> 01:47:10,680
but you kill things faster than both of us.

1508
01:47:10,680 --> 01:47:12,199
Because you just drop box on head.

1509
01:47:12,840 --> 01:47:14,600
It is true.

1510
01:47:14,600 --> 01:47:16,840
You do a shit ton of damage for no reason.

1511
01:47:16,840 --> 01:47:18,600
I've one shot every enemy so far.

1512
01:47:23,359 --> 01:47:24,960
Put box on head or pre-recorded.

1513
01:47:24,960 --> 01:47:25,920
Well, you have to do that one.

1514
01:47:26,720 --> 01:47:28,399
I mean, that's just proves it at least.

1515
01:47:28,399 --> 01:47:29,920
If you were if you guys were here earlier,

1516
01:47:29,920 --> 01:47:32,720
you know that box on head is the end game.

1517
01:47:33,680 --> 01:47:35,000
Oh, that's right.

1518
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:36,520
There might be a thing up here.

1519
01:47:36,520 --> 01:47:37,000
Is there?

1520
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:37,800
One up.

1521
01:47:37,800 --> 01:47:38,119
Maybe.

1522
01:47:42,750 --> 01:47:44,729
I think you're gonna have to like it.

1523
01:47:44,729 --> 01:47:45,930
I'm gonna have to do the worms.

1524
01:47:45,930 --> 01:47:47,369
I'm gonna do the worms ninja rope.

1525
01:47:48,350 --> 01:47:51,760
Yeah, this guy knows there is something up here

1526
01:47:52,399 --> 01:47:55,199
and it is an elaborate thing that we need.

1527
01:47:55,199 --> 01:47:56,960
I think more than one person for.

1528
01:47:56,960 --> 01:47:58,239
Oh, okay.

1529
01:47:58,239 --> 01:47:58,640
Hold on.

1530
01:47:58,640 --> 01:48:00,880
Wait, can I drop it somehow?

1531
01:48:03,710 --> 01:48:05,069
Is there a thing I can shoot?

1532
01:48:05,069 --> 01:48:06,989
Actually, actually die already.

1533
01:48:06,989 --> 01:48:08,109
I don't want to die.

1534
01:48:08,109 --> 01:48:08,590
It hurts.

1535
01:48:09,149 --> 01:48:13,560
Oh, we're going to need your help to get over.

1536
01:48:14,840 --> 01:48:16,520
I think you got to make like a rope for us.

1537
01:48:16,520 --> 01:48:16,920
Do I?

1538
01:48:19,050 --> 01:48:19,930
Yeah, please.

1539
01:48:19,930 --> 01:48:20,970
With all your usefulness.

1540
01:48:21,850 --> 01:48:22,170
Okay.

1541
01:48:22,170 --> 01:48:30,000
Well, please, as the OP character,

1542
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:32,399
come make come make a bridge for us to cross

1543
01:48:32,399 --> 01:48:33,760
like I would normally be doing.

1544
01:48:34,319 --> 01:48:34,560
Yeah.

1545
01:48:34,560 --> 01:48:34,800
Okay.

1546
01:48:36,279 --> 01:48:39,100
So that all right.

1547
01:48:39,100 --> 01:48:40,699
Now we all have to go over there

1548
01:48:45,760 --> 01:48:46,880
because then there's this stuff.

1549
01:48:48,140 --> 01:48:49,260
Sorry, I will unfreeze.

1550
01:48:49,260 --> 01:48:49,739
Get out the way.

1551
01:48:49,739 --> 01:48:51,579
I love how you're already frozen.

1552
01:48:51,579 --> 01:48:52,300
Get off my box.

1553
01:48:52,300 --> 01:48:52,779
Get out the way.

1554
01:48:52,779 --> 01:48:53,180
I got this.

1555
01:48:53,180 --> 01:48:53,979
I'm going to solo it.

1556
01:48:54,699 --> 01:48:54,859
All right.

1557
01:48:54,859 --> 01:48:55,579
Let him solo it.

1558
01:48:55,579 --> 01:48:55,899
All right.

1559
01:48:56,939 --> 01:48:58,779
Let him do his thing that he wants to do so bad.

1560
01:49:01,069 --> 01:49:01,470
All right.

1561
01:49:01,470 --> 01:49:02,109
Cool.

1562
01:49:02,109 --> 01:49:02,350
Nice.

1563
01:49:03,470 --> 01:49:06,859
That would sound like.

1564
01:49:08,060 --> 01:49:09,500
Yeah.

1565
01:49:10,140 --> 01:49:10,619
All right.

1566
01:49:10,619 --> 01:49:10,939
Call.

1567
01:49:13,180 --> 01:49:15,180
I don't I don't remember sounding, but all right.

1568
01:49:17,560 --> 01:49:18,760
Miss the collectible.

1569
01:49:18,760 --> 01:49:19,239
All right.

1570
01:49:19,239 --> 01:49:20,199
Did you miss the collection?

1571
01:49:20,199 --> 01:49:21,640
Did you really get up there?

1572
01:49:21,640 --> 01:49:23,239
You cared so much about your ego

1573
01:49:23,239 --> 01:49:24,439
and how good you are at video games

1574
01:49:24,439 --> 01:49:25,479
that you didn't get the collectible.

1575
01:49:25,479 --> 01:49:27,800
I just want to feel like my character can do something.

1576
01:49:28,680 --> 01:49:30,199
You know, not something.

1577
01:49:30,199 --> 01:49:31,960
I feel like when they designed to try

1578
01:49:31,960 --> 01:49:33,720
and they knew I was going to be the wizard

1579
01:49:33,720 --> 01:49:35,000
and they wanted me to feel bad.

1580
01:49:39,609 --> 01:49:42,359
Had a phobia for driving and getting through this garden.

1581
01:49:42,359 --> 01:49:44,279
German's more of a Patrick than a Squidward.

1582
01:49:46,520 --> 01:49:48,039
I would say star is a Squidward.

1583
01:49:48,840 --> 01:49:50,569
Let's stop talking about this.

1584
01:49:50,569 --> 01:49:53,369
Yeah, I'll agree with them.

1585
01:49:53,369 --> 01:49:55,609
Then we really shouldn't be adding any arrows into this.

1586
01:49:55,609 --> 01:49:56,409
I want to be Mr.

1587
01:49:56,409 --> 01:49:56,729
Fred's.

1588
01:49:57,689 --> 01:50:01,130
Maybe we'll be lucky and there'll be no other monsters to contend with.

1589
01:50:01,130 --> 01:50:02,569
Amadeus is hopeful.

1590
01:50:02,569 --> 01:50:03,689
Optimism was.

1591
01:50:06,170 --> 01:50:07,529
It's the one doing nothing.

1592
01:50:07,529 --> 01:50:09,050
Ban that guy instantly.

1593
01:50:09,050 --> 01:50:09,369
Come on.

1594
01:50:10,649 --> 01:50:11,369
Where are my muds?

1595
01:50:14,489 --> 01:50:16,090
He dropped like a rope or something.

1596
01:50:18,039 --> 01:50:19,159
What do you need help?

1597
01:50:19,159 --> 01:50:20,520
All of a sudden you need help?

1598
01:50:20,520 --> 01:50:21,399
No, I don't.

1599
01:50:21,399 --> 01:50:22,279
I don't need any help.

1600
01:50:25,680 --> 01:50:26,800
Jerm is the one who needs help.

1601
01:50:27,760 --> 01:50:29,039
I was up top the whole time.

1602
01:50:29,039 --> 01:50:29,680
No, I don't.

1603
01:50:29,680 --> 01:50:30,319
No, I don't.

1604
01:50:30,319 --> 01:50:31,359
He doesn't need help.

1605
01:50:31,359 --> 01:50:31,840
I don't.

1606
01:50:31,840 --> 01:50:32,079
No.

1607
01:50:36,439 --> 01:50:36,760
I don't.

1608
01:50:36,760 --> 01:50:37,720
I just stay there.

1609
01:50:43,689 --> 01:50:44,489
Spongebob do this.

1610
01:50:47,260 --> 01:50:47,979
All right, let's go.

1611
01:50:49,739 --> 01:50:51,100
Spongebob kind of does do that,

1612
01:50:51,100 --> 01:50:53,020
but except instead of pounding, it goes.

1613
01:50:54,720 --> 01:50:55,920
Hey guys, remember this?

1614
01:50:58,359 --> 01:50:59,720
Here, you stand on my box.

1615
01:51:00,439 --> 01:51:00,840
Run up.

1616
01:51:01,560 --> 01:51:06,359
Does that even work?

1617
01:51:08,380 --> 01:51:08,859
I jump.

1618
01:51:11,039 --> 01:51:11,359
Hold on.

1619
01:51:11,359 --> 01:51:11,920
Okay.

1620
01:51:11,920 --> 01:51:12,319
You have...

1621
01:51:12,319 --> 01:51:12,640
Okay.

1622
01:51:12,640 --> 01:51:13,520
You jump and...

1623
01:51:14,079 --> 01:51:15,359
Everyone hated that.

1624
01:51:15,359 --> 01:51:16,800
Jerma has to shoot Jerma.

1625
01:51:16,800 --> 01:51:17,300
Stop.

1626
01:51:18,840 --> 01:51:19,720
Ashley, go to the left.

1627
01:51:20,359 --> 01:51:21,520
All right.

1628
01:51:21,520 --> 01:51:22,560
I mean, that one worked.

1629
01:51:23,439 --> 01:51:24,399
I have to freeze it.

1630
01:51:24,399 --> 01:51:24,800
I know.

1631
01:51:25,920 --> 01:51:27,159
All right.

1632
01:51:27,159 --> 01:51:28,439
And then I shoot a normal one.

1633
01:51:28,439 --> 01:51:29,720
Jerma could just freeze all of them.

1634
01:51:30,359 --> 01:51:31,399
Just not hold it up there.

1635
01:51:31,399 --> 01:51:31,880
Watch this.

1636
01:51:33,229 --> 01:51:33,630
Okay.

1637
01:51:33,630 --> 01:51:34,270
Never mind.

1638
01:51:34,270 --> 01:51:35,550
Jerma does the whole puzzle.

1639
01:51:36,880 --> 01:51:39,119
Yeah, nice character trying for...

1640
01:51:42,840 --> 01:51:44,439
Oh no, there's a combat sequence.

1641
01:51:44,439 --> 01:51:46,920
I wonder if Starb will kill everything in less than 10 seconds.

1642
01:51:48,439 --> 01:51:50,640
Should I even fight?

1643
01:51:51,359 --> 01:51:54,989
You know, that goes both ways, right?

1644
01:51:56,300 --> 01:51:57,180
You can freeze them.

1645
01:51:57,180 --> 01:51:58,380
I don't want to hear shit from you.

1646
01:52:00,060 --> 01:52:00,939
We missed a secret.

1647
01:52:05,050 --> 01:52:05,689
Over this way.

1648
01:52:06,250 --> 01:52:07,770
Or something.

1649
01:52:07,770 --> 01:52:08,170
Where is it?

1650
01:52:09,560 --> 01:52:10,920
Are you listening to your chat right now?

1651
01:52:10,920 --> 01:52:11,560
And you're making out?

1652
01:52:11,560 --> 01:52:12,119
No, no, no.

1653
01:52:12,119 --> 01:52:12,439
Look, look.

1654
01:52:12,439 --> 01:52:13,159
It's right here.

1655
01:52:13,159 --> 01:52:13,880
Is it up?

1656
01:52:13,880 --> 01:52:14,680
It's up.

1657
01:52:14,680 --> 01:52:15,159
There is.

1658
01:52:17,159 --> 01:52:24,439
Coming, big boy.

1659
01:52:24,680 --> 01:52:28,600
Thank you to Squirds for the five community subs.

1660
01:52:28,600 --> 01:52:29,239
Thank you, Squirds.

1661
01:52:30,199 --> 01:52:30,680
Appreciate it.

1662
01:52:31,640 --> 01:52:34,170
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1663
01:52:35,630 --> 01:52:36,829
Congratulations to those who got it.

1664
01:52:38,010 --> 01:52:38,409
I'm up.

1665
01:52:41,039 --> 01:52:42,239
There's so much blood in here.

1666
01:52:42,880 --> 01:52:43,850
But we need you guys...

1667
01:52:45,600 --> 01:52:46,720
Well, at least I need Jerma.

1668
01:52:47,279 --> 01:52:47,680
You need me?

1669
01:52:47,680 --> 01:52:48,800
I don't know about Steve.

1670
01:52:48,800 --> 01:52:49,039
Yeah.

1671
01:52:50,560 --> 01:52:52,670
Thanks for the boost.

1672
01:52:53,310 --> 01:52:53,550
Hey.

1673
01:52:54,430 --> 01:52:58,239
Okay, what's up here?

1674
01:52:58,239 --> 01:52:59,199
Ooh, one of these things.

1675
01:53:00,539 --> 01:53:01,739
I think I can give you a bridge.

1676
01:53:02,539 --> 01:53:04,239
That'd be cool, wouldn't it?

1677
01:53:04,960 --> 01:53:07,020
Can I do that?

1678
01:53:07,020 --> 01:53:07,500
Yeah, I can.

1679
01:53:09,020 --> 01:53:10,989
And there's a treasure in here.

1680
01:53:15,310 --> 01:53:16,909
That's cool how you guys needed me.

1681
01:53:16,909 --> 01:53:19,390
Well, you are turning into like the third wheel here instead.

1682
01:53:19,390 --> 01:53:20,270
Can I get some more water?

1683
01:53:21,390 --> 01:53:21,630
Yeah.

1684
01:53:22,880 --> 01:53:23,359
Happy.

1685
01:53:24,239 --> 01:53:27,079
Also, can I see a drink menu when you get a chance?

1686
01:53:27,800 --> 01:53:28,729
Oh, yeah.

1687
01:53:34,970 --> 01:53:37,949
Today our special is lemonade.

1688
01:53:41,550 --> 01:53:43,229
What a shitty restaurant.

1689
01:53:44,750 --> 01:53:45,789
Oh, okay.

1690
01:53:45,789 --> 01:53:47,069
You have lemonade today.

1691
01:53:48,729 --> 01:53:51,159
Now?

1692
01:53:51,159 --> 01:53:52,039
It's poisoned.

1693
01:53:57,100 --> 01:53:58,840
Oh, I got you, Ashley.

1694
01:54:05,899 --> 01:54:07,500
Today's special, bread.

1695
01:54:09,579 --> 01:54:12,060
Our special, bread and lemonade.

1696
01:54:13,659 --> 01:54:16,170
What is that?

1697
01:54:17,130 --> 01:54:20,250
Our dessert menu, we have a bag of Oreos.

1698
01:54:20,250 --> 01:54:21,130
Is this prison?

1699
01:54:23,399 --> 01:54:24,920
Is this a prison restaurant?

1700
01:54:25,640 --> 01:54:31,319
Would it be cool if the two of you went to prison together?

1701
01:54:31,319 --> 01:54:31,720
It would.

1702
01:54:31,720 --> 01:54:32,840
We should film that video.

1703
01:54:32,840 --> 01:54:35,560
No, they've made movies about that kind of shit before.

1704
01:54:35,560 --> 01:54:36,439
But not with us.

1705
01:54:37,640 --> 01:54:39,479
Yeah, but it would be the same movie.

1706
01:54:41,470 --> 01:54:41,949
But better.

1707
01:54:42,590 --> 01:54:45,920
Well, two guys, two guys are unprepared for prison.

1708
01:54:45,920 --> 01:54:46,800
Go to prison.

1709
01:54:46,800 --> 01:54:48,479
And whoa, I wasn't ready for this.

1710
01:54:49,819 --> 01:54:50,699
Nobody's gonna read that.

1711
01:54:52,300 --> 01:54:52,859
My mistake.

1712
01:54:52,859 --> 01:55:06,090
I think this is a boss coming up.

1713
01:55:07,479 --> 01:55:08,359
Oh, oh, mechanic.

1714
01:55:22,569 --> 01:55:23,130
Oh, cool.

1715
01:55:24,170 --> 01:55:24,810
I'll just wait.

1716
01:55:27,210 --> 01:55:27,850
You got to charge.

1717
01:55:32,649 --> 01:55:34,729
Oh, you have to charge at this thing.

1718
01:55:34,729 --> 01:55:35,050
Okay.

1719
01:55:35,050 --> 01:55:36,329
That was fucking cool.

1720
01:55:37,130 --> 01:55:37,449
Whoa.

1721
01:55:38,329 --> 01:55:39,529
I get a super arrow now.

1722
01:55:40,170 --> 01:55:40,810
You guys.

1723
01:55:40,810 --> 01:55:41,770
This looks so.

1724
01:55:41,770 --> 01:55:42,489
Oh, my God.

1725
01:55:42,489 --> 01:55:44,090
You guys are doing such cool things.

1726
01:55:46,409 --> 01:55:48,970
Wait, do you need a box?

1727
01:55:48,970 --> 01:55:50,090
I need someone to go in there.

1728
01:55:57,100 --> 01:55:59,899
Do we need a box right now?

1729
01:56:00,779 --> 01:56:01,020
Yeah.

1730
01:56:02,300 --> 01:56:03,979
My salmon was fucking cold.

1731
01:56:06,800 --> 01:56:07,199
Salmon.

1732
01:56:07,199 --> 01:56:08,159
We don't serve salmon.

1733
01:56:09,520 --> 01:56:10,800
You have to freeze the water there.

1734
01:56:11,760 --> 01:56:12,319
Freeze gun.

1735
01:56:12,319 --> 01:56:13,119
Did I bring this?

1736
01:56:14,159 --> 01:56:15,279
Is that why it's cold?

1737
01:56:15,279 --> 01:56:15,920
Was this in the car?

1738
01:56:16,960 --> 01:56:23,550
I just love it when you start role playing out of nowhere.

1739
01:56:24,189 --> 01:56:32,170
Imagine going to a fucking restaurant and like bringing like a whole plate of dinner,

1740
01:56:32,170 --> 01:56:35,930
like salmon, like a whole, you bring, you bring this in and it's like freezing cold

1741
01:56:35,930 --> 01:56:37,770
and you set it up there and like, excuse me.

1742
01:56:37,770 --> 01:56:38,649
Ashley, come back here.

1743
01:56:39,529 --> 01:56:42,569
I don't want to bother you anything, but like this is freezing fucking cold.

1744
01:56:42,569 --> 01:56:42,970
Touch it.

1745
01:56:50,539 --> 01:56:52,380
Sir, we don't have salmon on the menu.

1746
01:56:52,380 --> 01:56:57,260
What do you do?

1747
01:56:59,100 --> 01:57:01,100
That's when you say, yeah, it's, oh, it's cool.

1748
01:57:01,100 --> 01:57:01,340
Oh yeah.

1749
01:57:01,340 --> 01:57:02,380
Cause I, it was in my car.

1750
01:57:03,739 --> 01:57:04,460
I'm sorry.

1751
01:57:04,460 --> 01:57:05,260
Can I get the check?

1752
01:57:07,020 --> 01:57:07,340
Yeah.

1753
01:57:07,340 --> 01:57:08,380
You haven't ordered anything.

1754
01:57:09,180 --> 01:57:10,479
That's all right.

1755
01:57:10,479 --> 01:57:11,199
Can I still get one?

1756
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:18,510
I kind of need to prove that I was here just in case I did an alibi.

1757
01:57:20,909 --> 01:57:21,550
She has a blink.

1758
01:57:21,550 --> 01:57:22,510
Hey, do you need a box?

1759
01:57:22,510 --> 01:57:22,909
Oh no.

1760
01:57:27,079 --> 01:57:28,699
All right.

1761
01:57:29,180 --> 01:57:33,579
Anything under here might need a box here.

1762
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:35,960
Oh, one head twirl.

1763
01:57:36,680 --> 01:57:37,720
How come I can't grab that?

1764
01:57:37,720 --> 01:57:40,840
Oh, wait, did we go up there already?

1765
01:57:41,960 --> 01:57:42,439
Throw me up.

1766
01:57:44,640 --> 01:57:45,199
Sorry, sir.

1767
01:57:45,199 --> 01:57:46,960
We don't validate alibis here.

1768
01:57:53,020 --> 01:57:56,779
Well, there's a big, there's a big like 12% tip for you.

1769
01:57:58,909 --> 01:58:00,750
No, no, no, no, right here.

1770
01:58:04,189 --> 01:58:08,760
No, please respect that box guy.

1771
01:58:08,760 --> 01:58:10,359
I need to freeze that.

1772
01:58:10,359 --> 01:58:13,640
I respect it, but can you please put it where I can freeze it in a good spot?

1773
01:58:14,199 --> 01:58:15,159
Thank you.

1774
01:58:15,159 --> 01:58:16,520
Put it in a spot where I can freeze this.

1775
01:58:16,520 --> 01:58:18,920
She can, she can fucking air dash.

1776
01:58:18,920 --> 01:58:21,479
Yes, but let me like flex on you too.

1777
01:58:22,840 --> 01:58:24,359
I can't, I can't put it anywhere else.

1778
01:58:24,359 --> 01:58:25,399
I'm useless now.

1779
01:58:25,399 --> 01:58:26,760
What is you freezing this going to do?

1780
01:58:27,720 --> 01:58:28,600
I still made it.

1781
01:58:28,600 --> 01:58:29,560
I still made it.

1782
01:58:31,640 --> 01:58:32,039
Help.

1783
01:58:32,039 --> 01:58:33,159
What are you going to do for you though?

1784
01:58:33,800 --> 01:58:34,199
Help.

1785
01:58:35,949 --> 01:58:36,270
Here.

1786
01:58:37,630 --> 01:58:39,659
Oh, thanks, journal.

1787
01:58:39,659 --> 01:58:40,380
You did it again.

1788
01:58:41,020 --> 01:58:41,760
You got it.

1789
01:58:42,460 --> 01:58:43,579
I just pulled it.

1790
01:58:43,579 --> 01:58:44,220
Did you not get it?

1791
01:58:44,220 --> 01:58:45,020
Keep pulling.

1792
01:58:45,020 --> 01:58:45,979
Oh, there we go.

1793
01:58:46,699 --> 01:58:48,409
Oh, there's things up here.

1794
01:58:48,409 --> 01:58:51,449
You guys, you're going so fast because your characters are so powerful.

1795
01:58:51,449 --> 01:58:53,210
You missed the secrets.

1796
01:58:53,210 --> 01:58:56,170
So wait, is this, is this a case of they nerfed the wizard so much

1797
01:58:56,170 --> 01:58:57,689
because they were afraid of how powerful he was

1798
01:58:57,689 --> 01:58:59,609
to now the wizard's not really that great anymore?

1799
01:59:00,510 --> 01:59:03,869
I think the next level, I get my ability, but I'm just being,

1800
01:59:03,869 --> 01:59:05,390
I'm being dramatic until then.

1801
01:59:05,390 --> 01:59:08,350
Are you, is there anything else up there?

1802
01:59:09,310 --> 01:59:10,430
Yeah, there's a big one up there.

1803
01:59:10,430 --> 01:59:11,149
Oh, it's a big one.

1804
01:59:12,430 --> 01:59:13,310
Big fatty.

1805
01:59:13,310 --> 01:59:13,949
Yeah.

1806
01:59:13,949 --> 01:59:14,189
No.

1807
01:59:14,829 --> 01:59:15,390
Give me a boost.

1808
01:59:20,569 --> 01:59:22,409
I didn't need it for the record.

1809
01:59:22,409 --> 01:59:22,810
You get it?

1810
01:59:22,810 --> 01:59:23,449
Okay.

1811
01:59:23,449 --> 01:59:24,090
Yeah.

1812
01:59:24,090 --> 01:59:24,409
Nice.

1813
01:59:27,979 --> 01:59:29,979
I'll just, just wait until there's some combat.

1814
01:59:32,520 --> 01:59:33,640
Oh, and then we'll use that.

1815
01:59:36,029 --> 01:59:36,430
Oh, wait.

1816
01:59:36,430 --> 01:59:36,909
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1817
01:59:39,100 --> 01:59:40,520
But you're blocking it.

1818
01:59:40,520 --> 01:59:41,159
There's a box in the way.

1819
01:59:42,439 --> 01:59:45,000
Oh, we need to think about this one.

1820
01:59:49,020 --> 01:59:49,340
I think.

1821
01:59:49,979 --> 01:59:51,020
We need your point.

1822
01:59:51,020 --> 01:59:51,260
No.

1823
01:59:51,260 --> 01:59:51,979
Somebody can stand on it.

1824
01:59:51,979 --> 01:59:53,340
I can stick my box under it.

1825
01:59:53,340 --> 01:59:54,300
No, somebody can just stand on it.

1826
01:59:55,500 --> 01:59:56,300
Yeah, and then put it under.

1827
01:59:56,939 --> 01:59:58,670
There we go.

1828
01:59:58,670 --> 01:59:58,989
See?

1829
01:59:58,989 --> 02:00:00,430
Box guy, box guy.

1830
02:00:00,430 --> 02:00:01,630
Here comes box guy.

1831
02:00:12,640 --> 02:00:13,359
Can I freeze that?

1832
02:00:14,640 --> 02:00:15,960
Let me see.

1833
02:00:15,960 --> 02:00:19,640
It's like the Mario level with all the invisible blocks that show up in the first spot.

1834
02:00:19,640 --> 02:00:20,840
I'm the kaizo block.

1835
02:00:21,960 --> 02:00:23,079
Oh, I can freeze that.

1836
02:00:23,079 --> 02:00:23,319
Okay.

1837
02:00:24,600 --> 02:00:25,640
Lift me up?

1838
02:00:25,640 --> 02:00:26,039
Hold on.

1839
02:00:27,640 --> 02:00:28,439
Push it up like high.

1840
02:00:29,079 --> 02:00:32,640
And then, yeah, now I'll freeze it.

1841
02:00:32,640 --> 02:00:34,079
Can you lift this or do, do I?

1842
02:00:35,199 --> 02:00:35,600
Is that enough?

1843
02:00:35,600 --> 02:00:40,859
I can if someone wasn't standing on it, but someone keeps standing on it.

1844
02:00:40,859 --> 02:00:43,100
I can get over there at the back of the line.

1845
02:00:43,100 --> 02:00:43,819
Give it a good lift.

1846
02:00:44,619 --> 02:00:44,939
Lift.

1847
02:00:46,140 --> 02:00:47,020
There you go.

1848
02:00:47,020 --> 02:00:47,340
See?

1849
02:00:48,220 --> 02:00:49,979
No doubt.

1850
02:00:50,619 --> 02:00:54,829
I mean, we were trying to freeze it and then we can get up and the whole teamwork thing.

1851
02:00:55,949 --> 02:00:59,789
You might, you might feel like you don't need the wizard anymore, but I need you.

1852
02:01:01,470 --> 02:01:04,270
The wizard.

1853
02:01:06,090 --> 02:01:08,840
Oh, oh, oh, okay.

1854
02:01:08,840 --> 02:01:09,960
There's a bunch of stuff up here.

1855
02:01:10,680 --> 02:01:12,439
There's a whole nother way to go.

1856
02:01:12,439 --> 02:01:13,239
What the hell is this?

1857
02:01:14,279 --> 02:01:15,880
But wait, get it.

1858
02:01:16,760 --> 02:01:17,079
Got him.

1859
02:01:17,079 --> 02:01:17,640
What's going on?

1860
02:01:22,189 --> 02:01:24,109
I'm not entirely sure what's going on over there.

1861
02:01:24,109 --> 02:01:25,229
Maybe you, I think we need to break this.

1862
02:01:26,270 --> 02:01:27,210
Come on, Steve.

1863
02:01:27,210 --> 02:01:27,449
You good?

1864
02:01:28,649 --> 02:01:29,289
Yeah.

1865
02:01:29,289 --> 02:01:32,840
So what do we do about this?

1866
02:01:32,840 --> 02:01:36,680
You got to get the rock from the top right and then Ashley has to smash it at the wall.

1867
02:01:38,520 --> 02:01:40,430
Watch out, I'm going to smash.

1868
02:01:42,750 --> 02:01:43,470
Smash.

1869
02:01:43,470 --> 02:01:44,829
You got to smash it upwards.

1870
02:01:44,829 --> 02:01:45,229
Get out.

1871
02:01:47,210 --> 02:01:48,890
Look, you need the, you don't need my ability.

1872
02:01:48,890 --> 02:01:50,810
But you need me to tell you that you're wrong.

1873
02:01:50,810 --> 02:01:51,930
Tell a joke or riot.

1874
02:01:53,130 --> 02:01:54,359
Oh, well, whatever.

1875
02:02:02,279 --> 02:02:03,399
Need a box.

1876
02:02:03,399 --> 02:02:04,039
I need a box.

1877
02:02:09,819 --> 02:02:10,699
No squad stream.

1878
02:02:10,699 --> 02:02:12,859
Yeah, that's because Jerma doesn't want it.

1879
02:02:12,859 --> 02:02:15,760
He's sick of, he's sick of sharing viewers.

1880
02:02:15,760 --> 02:02:17,279
He said it's not fair.

1881
02:02:18,720 --> 02:02:19,439
He's not fair.

1882
02:02:19,439 --> 02:02:21,439
You're just going to leech off me every time.

1883
02:02:21,439 --> 02:02:22,960
So he said he didn't want to do it anymore.

1884
02:02:23,520 --> 02:02:25,760
This is absolutely untrue.

1885
02:02:26,880 --> 02:02:28,960
This is total fabrication.

1886
02:02:29,359 --> 02:02:30,720
I got to defend myself here.

1887
02:02:33,020 --> 02:02:35,739
Jerma won't even talk to anyone unless you have a stream.

1888
02:02:35,739 --> 02:02:37,100
I can't, I can't smash the guy.

1889
02:02:37,100 --> 02:02:38,300
He's got box blockers.

1890
02:02:40,159 --> 02:02:40,479
Kill him.

1891
02:02:40,479 --> 02:02:41,039
I froze him.

1892
02:02:41,760 --> 02:02:44,520
Star, drop your box on his head.

1893
02:02:44,520 --> 02:02:46,520
I can't, those walls block the box.

1894
02:02:53,899 --> 02:03:01,180
By the way, a squad stream on this game would be you opening three tabs of the same stream.

1895
02:03:01,819 --> 02:03:03,500
Let's just be clear on that.

1896
02:03:03,500 --> 02:03:05,500
Yeah, you have to, I have to bring this rock up top.

1897
02:03:09,390 --> 02:03:10,960
Can you freeze it?

1898
02:03:12,079 --> 02:03:12,640
Oh, sorry.

1899
02:03:13,600 --> 02:03:14,239
I froze it.

1900
02:03:15,960 --> 02:03:16,460
Yeah.

1901
02:03:19,239 --> 02:03:20,600
You hear that in this song?

1902
02:03:22,520 --> 02:03:23,239
Is it doing that?

1903
02:03:24,539 --> 02:03:25,819
It's the ding fries are done.

1904
02:03:28,479 --> 02:03:29,520
Ding, what are you talking about?

1905
02:03:30,560 --> 02:03:32,319
Can I freeze the water coming out of there?

1906
02:03:32,319 --> 02:03:34,079
I actually don't know what that sound normally is.

1907
02:03:35,199 --> 02:03:36,319
All right, I've got that frozen.

1908
02:03:37,199 --> 02:03:40,319
And now bounce the water from here into the, into the wheel.

1909
02:03:41,760 --> 02:03:42,479
I did that already.

1910
02:03:43,439 --> 02:03:45,520
What about the up, the up wheel, the wheel up there?

1911
02:03:47,340 --> 02:03:49,020
Oh, what about the up wheel?

1912
02:03:51,159 --> 02:03:52,590
How do we get the wheel?

1913
02:03:52,590 --> 02:03:53,470
How do we get the up wheel?

1914
02:03:54,109 --> 02:04:02,159
What's up wheel?

1915
02:04:04,800 --> 02:04:05,920
Okay, then freeze that.

1916
02:04:07,039 --> 02:04:07,680
And now.

1917
02:04:07,680 --> 02:04:08,239
Oh, okay.

1918
02:04:08,239 --> 02:04:08,800
Hold on.

1919
02:04:08,800 --> 02:04:09,199
Sorry.

1920
02:04:09,199 --> 02:04:12,720
If someone's going to talk shit about me now, stir confirmed family guy reference.

1921
02:04:12,720 --> 02:04:14,720
That was like an e-bombs world.

1922
02:04:15,840 --> 02:04:16,720
Joke, meme.

1923
02:04:16,720 --> 02:04:17,520
Is this going to work?

1924
02:04:18,640 --> 02:04:19,279
How do we do this?

1925
02:04:20,159 --> 02:04:22,250
Oh, you know, okay.

1926
02:04:22,250 --> 02:04:23,369
It kind of did for a second.

1927
02:04:24,170 --> 02:04:25,050
Oh my God, that worked.

1928
02:04:28,640 --> 02:04:29,439
As intended.

1929
02:04:29,439 --> 02:04:34,479
Star, what's, what the fuck is Spider-Man's name?

1930
02:04:34,479 --> 02:04:36,399
A fucking, what the fuck?

1931
02:04:36,399 --> 02:04:37,439
Why can I not think of this name?

1932
02:04:37,439 --> 02:04:39,439
Oh, Parkle, Parkle Pepper.

1933
02:04:39,439 --> 02:04:40,319
No, no, no.

1934
02:04:40,319 --> 02:04:40,880
Peter Pickle.

1935
02:04:41,439 --> 02:04:41,760
What is it?

1936
02:04:41,760 --> 02:04:42,640
What's the first one?

1937
02:04:42,640 --> 02:04:44,000
Peter Parker picked the pepper.

1938
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:45,600
Oh, fucking family guy over here.

1939
02:04:45,600 --> 02:04:46,399
Fucking Peter.

1940
02:04:46,399 --> 02:04:46,899
Nice.

1941
02:04:47,520 --> 02:04:48,960
Oh, people, people, Peter.

1942
02:04:50,079 --> 02:04:55,340
I got him to say it.

1943
02:04:55,340 --> 02:04:57,260
Now you can, you guys can take that.

1944
02:04:57,979 --> 02:05:00,619
You guys can clip that one second that he did it.

1945
02:05:04,479 --> 02:05:05,039
Well, there you go.

1946
02:05:05,039 --> 02:05:05,840
Now he said it for real.

1947
02:05:06,640 --> 02:05:10,010
Who's your favorite family guy character, Steve?

1948
02:05:10,810 --> 02:05:12,399
Who do you identify with?

1949
02:05:13,199 --> 02:05:17,199
If you're going to like clip me and put me in like the German green screen videos,

1950
02:05:17,199 --> 02:05:20,880
just have me show up real fast and say, anybody need a box?

1951
02:05:20,880 --> 02:05:22,000
I need to skip jump.

1952
02:05:24,029 --> 02:05:24,529
Nope.

1953
02:05:29,229 --> 02:05:29,710
No, stop it.

1954
02:05:29,710 --> 02:05:30,670
I can, I can do this.

1955
02:05:32,970 --> 02:05:35,050
Oh, stop participating.

1956
02:05:35,050 --> 02:05:35,550
Okay.

1957
02:05:36,250 --> 02:05:36,649
All right.

1958
02:05:36,649 --> 02:05:37,850
This game is on you now.

1959
02:05:40,779 --> 02:05:41,340
Can you get up?

1960
02:05:41,340 --> 02:05:42,300
I'll wait till I meet it.

1961
02:05:42,300 --> 02:05:42,800
Okay, good.

1962
02:05:46,270 --> 02:05:47,229
Ego maniac.

1963
02:05:51,130 --> 02:05:51,449
There you go.

1964
02:05:51,449 --> 02:05:52,329
It's safe.

1965
02:05:52,329 --> 02:05:53,850
What's your favorite family guy character?

1966
02:05:57,770 --> 02:05:58,409
Adam West.

1967
02:05:59,609 --> 02:06:01,130
Hey, there's a whole thing up here, guys.

1968
02:06:01,130 --> 02:06:02,489
Are we doing the thing still?

1969
02:06:02,489 --> 02:06:03,449
We're doing a top left.

1970
02:06:03,449 --> 02:06:04,729
Come up here and do the thing or?

1971
02:06:04,970 --> 02:06:11,180
Oh, it's kind of high up there.

1972
02:06:11,180 --> 02:06:12,300
How am I supposed to make it up?

1973
02:06:13,340 --> 02:06:14,539
You need help?

1974
02:06:14,539 --> 02:06:15,500
I think I can grab it.

1975
02:06:16,460 --> 02:06:16,960
Nope.

1976
02:06:22,409 --> 02:06:22,970
It's just Adam.

1977
02:06:22,970 --> 02:06:25,369
It's Adam West because Adam West was just cool.

1978
02:06:25,369 --> 02:06:27,210
Like, is it?

1979
02:06:27,210 --> 02:06:28,409
He was a Batman.

1980
02:06:28,409 --> 02:06:28,909
He was.

1981
02:06:29,930 --> 02:06:31,850
Some would argue he was the best Batman.

1982
02:06:33,079 --> 02:06:33,319
All right.

1983
02:06:33,319 --> 02:06:34,439
I can freeze that.

1984
02:06:34,439 --> 02:06:35,720
So, but that doesn't help.

1985
02:06:37,550 --> 02:06:38,270
Wait, maybe we should free.

1986
02:06:38,270 --> 02:06:39,710
I should freeze this one.

1987
02:06:40,270 --> 02:06:40,829
Check this out.

1988
02:06:41,550 --> 02:06:42,350
Freeze that one.

1989
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:44,399
And then.

1990
02:06:45,899 --> 02:06:46,380
Never mind.

1991
02:06:47,020 --> 02:06:50,060
Freeze this one because I can only freeze one thing at a time.

1992
02:06:50,060 --> 02:06:51,979
Now unfreeze the other one because we're in.

1993
02:06:51,979 --> 02:06:52,699
You're in.

1994
02:06:52,699 --> 02:06:53,420
Unfreeze the wheel.

1995
02:06:55,979 --> 02:06:56,699
You're in.

1996
02:06:56,699 --> 02:06:57,420
Then freeze the wheel.

1997
02:06:58,909 --> 02:06:59,630
And then get up there.

1998
02:07:01,369 --> 02:07:02,090
And then do it again.

1999
02:07:02,090 --> 02:07:02,649
And then do it again.

2000
02:07:03,369 --> 02:07:03,930
And then do it.

2001
02:07:03,930 --> 02:07:04,489
Then do it again.

2002
02:07:06,489 --> 02:07:07,210
Then do it again.

2003
02:07:08,090 --> 02:07:09,949
And I'll do it again.

2004
02:07:15,079 --> 02:07:17,239
Oh, all right.

2005
02:07:18,359 --> 02:07:20,439
Wait, but now you're stuck in there.

2006
02:07:21,399 --> 02:07:22,140
Shit.

2007
02:07:22,140 --> 02:07:23,020
No, wait.

2008
02:07:23,020 --> 02:07:23,819
Do the bottom one.

2009
02:07:23,819 --> 02:07:24,619
Bottom one's easier.

2010
02:07:25,180 --> 02:07:25,420
All right.

2011
02:07:25,420 --> 02:07:26,539
I'm going to shift out of here.

2012
02:07:27,340 --> 02:07:27,659
Do it.

2013
02:07:29,449 --> 02:07:29,770
Do it.

2014
02:07:30,409 --> 02:07:30,729
Yeah.

2015
02:07:34,720 --> 02:07:35,680
I missed the chest.

2016
02:07:35,680 --> 02:07:36,640
I got the chest.

2017
02:07:36,640 --> 02:07:37,039
You did?

2018
02:07:38,239 --> 02:07:38,720
Yeah.

2019
02:07:38,720 --> 02:07:39,760
The whole thing showed up.

2020
02:07:39,760 --> 02:07:40,000
Chat.

2021
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:40,560
Oh, you got it.

2022
02:07:40,560 --> 02:07:42,000
I'm banning like seven people right now.

2023
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:42,319
Hold on.

2024
02:07:42,319 --> 02:07:43,920
They're all fucking gone for good.

2025
02:07:46,329 --> 02:07:47,689
And while you're not in my chat anymore,

2026
02:07:47,689 --> 02:07:49,050
do me a favor and look for those emails.

2027
02:07:49,689 --> 02:07:52,329
How many permanent bans have you given out on your channel, do you think?

2028
02:07:54,170 --> 02:07:54,409
Ow.

2029
02:07:55,050 --> 02:07:55,920
Uh-oh.

2030
02:07:57,020 --> 02:07:57,500
I don't know.

2031
02:07:57,500 --> 02:07:58,140
They're all gone now.

2032
02:07:58,140 --> 02:07:58,859
I removed them all.

2033
02:07:59,819 --> 02:08:00,060
All right.

2034
02:08:00,060 --> 02:08:02,619
So we got, what do we got here?

2035
02:08:03,260 --> 02:08:06,800
We have water, which, okay.

2036
02:08:07,520 --> 02:08:09,600
I tried to grab the thing, but it didn't work.

2037
02:08:11,340 --> 02:08:12,140
So if I do this.

2038
02:08:12,939 --> 02:08:14,220
No, I'm trying to stop it.

2039
02:08:17,359 --> 02:08:19,520
I need to attach this to that.

2040
02:08:19,520 --> 02:08:19,840
Okay.

2041
02:08:19,840 --> 02:08:21,039
I see what you're doing.

2042
02:08:21,039 --> 02:08:23,180
All right.

2043
02:08:23,180 --> 02:08:23,899
You need to, hmm.

2044
02:08:31,529 --> 02:08:32,649
Maybe, actually.

2045
02:08:33,529 --> 02:08:36,720
We need to bounce the water.

2046
02:08:37,520 --> 02:08:40,560
I have to free something here for Ashley to stand on.

2047
02:08:41,899 --> 02:08:44,060
I think, I think I know what needs to happen.

2048
02:08:46,170 --> 02:08:49,770
I think you might actually need to have to do a loop around with your rope

2049
02:08:49,770 --> 02:08:51,529
to make the water come down the rope.

2050
02:08:53,130 --> 02:08:57,979
No, I don't think so.

2051
02:08:59,439 --> 02:08:59,760
Oh, wait.

2052
02:08:59,760 --> 02:09:00,479
Or Ashley.

2053
02:09:00,479 --> 02:09:02,640
You can get into there.

2054
02:09:02,640 --> 02:09:02,880
Okay.

2055
02:09:02,880 --> 02:09:03,039
Yeah.

2056
02:09:03,039 --> 02:09:04,800
You just have to, you could probably, yeah.

2057
02:09:04,800 --> 02:09:05,760
Now you just bounce it up there.

2058
02:09:06,479 --> 02:09:11,149
It didn't open the gate or anything.

2059
02:09:11,149 --> 02:09:13,310
Well, no, I put the box back there and then turn this way.

2060
02:09:13,310 --> 02:09:14,430
Oh, the wheels above.

2061
02:09:14,430 --> 02:09:14,590
Yeah.

2062
02:09:14,590 --> 02:09:16,829
The wheels above you that have the water go shoot up.

2063
02:09:17,470 --> 02:09:19,050
Yeah.

2064
02:09:19,050 --> 02:09:22,920
Or if you have Ashley just bounce it up from there straight up.

2065
02:09:23,640 --> 02:09:24,760
Are you muted, Ashley?

2066
02:09:25,560 --> 02:09:26,600
Yeah, I was.

2067
02:09:26,600 --> 02:09:28,680
Not quite far enough, but hold on.

2068
02:09:28,680 --> 02:09:29,319
I can do this.

2069
02:09:30,119 --> 02:09:31,020
Is it going to work?

2070
02:09:31,979 --> 02:09:32,939
It worked last time.

2071
02:09:33,659 --> 02:09:37,680
Come on.

2072
02:09:37,680 --> 02:09:39,760
Can you bring this box in here so she can stand on it?

2073
02:09:41,199 --> 02:09:41,439
Yeah.

2074
02:09:43,079 --> 02:09:43,399
What?

2075
02:09:43,399 --> 02:09:43,880
Why?

2076
02:09:43,880 --> 02:09:44,600
No, I can't.

2077
02:09:46,619 --> 02:09:46,939
Look at this.

2078
02:09:46,939 --> 02:09:47,819
The box denied.

2079
02:09:48,460 --> 02:09:50,460
I'm trying to think of what, hmm.

2080
02:09:50,460 --> 02:09:54,720
It's like bouncing the same droplet over here.

2081
02:09:59,760 --> 02:10:00,159
Distract.

2082
02:10:00,159 --> 02:10:00,399
Yeah.

2083
02:10:00,399 --> 02:10:03,039
Can you stand on the box?

2084
02:10:03,039 --> 02:10:03,520
No.

2085
02:10:03,520 --> 02:10:04,800
Can, can she stand on the box?

2086
02:10:05,979 --> 02:10:06,859
Not while he's holding it.

2087
02:10:06,859 --> 02:10:07,659
Not while you're holding it.

2088
02:10:16,699 --> 02:10:17,979
Can you just do it?

2089
02:10:18,699 --> 02:10:19,260
Just hold on.

2090
02:10:20,460 --> 02:10:21,100
Just keep, keep it.

2091
02:10:21,100 --> 02:10:21,819
No, no, no.

2092
02:10:21,819 --> 02:10:25,369
Keep it like, um, tilted.

2093
02:10:25,369 --> 02:10:26,010
Yeah.

2094
02:10:26,010 --> 02:10:26,970
You just had it for a second.

2095
02:10:31,760 --> 02:10:32,720
You guys, it's physics.

2096
02:10:35,710 --> 02:10:36,909
Get wet, Will.

2097
02:10:36,909 --> 02:10:37,390
For what?

2098
02:10:37,390 --> 02:10:40,060
I don't, I don't get it.

2099
02:10:40,859 --> 02:10:44,380
And then your rope doesn't do it.

2100
02:10:46,430 --> 02:10:48,960
Now, I don't know.

2101
02:10:48,960 --> 02:10:50,880
Put the box down here and I'll stand on it.

2102
02:10:55,760 --> 02:10:56,239
There it is.

2103
02:10:57,039 --> 02:10:57,359
Kind of.

2104
02:11:00,890 --> 02:11:03,930
Oh, that's strong enough.

2105
02:11:03,930 --> 02:11:04,890
As intended.

2106
02:11:06,359 --> 02:11:06,840
Almost.

2107
02:11:14,270 --> 02:11:15,149
I don't think so.

2108
02:11:15,949 --> 02:11:16,909
Unless it's like this.

2109
02:11:17,550 --> 02:11:20,909
What if you freeze that where it's coming out of?

2110
02:11:20,909 --> 02:11:22,510
Will it come out of the other pipe or something?

2111
02:11:22,510 --> 02:11:22,989
I don't know.

2112
02:11:22,989 --> 02:11:23,550
There's some weird-

2113
02:11:23,550 --> 02:11:24,270
No, no!

2114
02:11:25,630 --> 02:11:26,029
Sorry.

2115
02:11:27,760 --> 02:11:28,000
No.

2116
02:11:29,100 --> 02:11:29,979
I just froze that.

2117
02:11:30,859 --> 02:11:32,960
Wait, shoot ice about again?

2118
02:11:33,760 --> 02:11:34,159
Wait a minute.

2119
02:11:34,159 --> 02:11:34,479
Hold on.

2120
02:11:35,359 --> 02:11:36,319
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

2121
02:11:36,319 --> 02:11:36,800
Wait a second.

2122
02:11:37,520 --> 02:11:38,600
Give me the, give me the box.

2123
02:11:38,600 --> 02:11:39,479
Give me the box, give me the box.

2124
02:11:39,479 --> 02:11:40,920
Give me the box, give me the box.

2125
02:11:40,920 --> 02:11:42,600
No, you didn't have to do that too.

2126
02:11:42,600 --> 02:11:43,079
Give me the box.

2127
02:11:43,079 --> 02:11:43,640
Give me over there.

2128
02:11:44,279 --> 02:11:45,000
Give me the other side.

2129
02:11:46,760 --> 02:11:47,000
Okay.

2130
02:11:47,720 --> 02:11:49,000
Get, oh, fuck.

2131
02:11:49,000 --> 02:11:49,479
Do it again.

2132
02:11:52,439 --> 02:11:53,239
All right.

2133
02:11:53,239 --> 02:11:56,520
Now, now get, give me the box.

2134
02:11:57,399 --> 02:11:58,800
Hold on.

2135
02:11:58,800 --> 02:12:00,560
Wait, wait, I don't, no wait on here.

2136
02:12:01,279 --> 02:12:03,359
I need to like get, I need to put this on top.

2137
02:12:04,479 --> 02:12:05,279
No, stop.

2138
02:12:05,279 --> 02:12:06,560
Why did you do that?

2139
02:12:07,520 --> 02:12:07,840
What?

2140
02:12:07,840 --> 02:12:08,960
You wanted the box, right?

2141
02:12:08,960 --> 02:12:09,439
I need to.

2142
02:12:09,439 --> 02:12:09,680
Okay.

2143
02:12:11,239 --> 02:12:12,760
I thought you were going to attach it to my box.

2144
02:12:13,399 --> 02:12:13,880
Get up there.

2145
02:12:20,250 --> 02:12:20,489
Wow.

2146
02:12:21,130 --> 02:12:21,609
This guy.

2147
02:12:22,970 --> 02:12:23,449
This guy.

2148
02:12:26,170 --> 02:12:26,729
This guy.

2149
02:12:28,760 --> 02:12:29,319
This guy.

2150
02:12:29,319 --> 02:12:31,000
Who deserves a trophy?

2151
02:12:31,000 --> 02:12:31,479
Do I?

2152
02:12:31,479 --> 02:12:31,880
Take one.

2153
02:12:32,840 --> 02:12:42,960
I can't do it.

2154
02:12:43,439 --> 02:12:44,399
The ceiling's too low.

2155
02:12:49,819 --> 02:12:51,100
I'm not even like trying.

2156
02:12:51,100 --> 02:12:52,300
We have fight sequences.

2157
02:12:52,300 --> 02:12:52,779
I'm sorry.

2158
02:12:53,899 --> 02:12:55,020
Oh, he said it.

2159
02:12:55,020 --> 02:12:55,979
He said the name.

2160
02:12:55,979 --> 02:12:57,100
I'm not even trying.

2161
02:12:58,859 --> 02:12:59,340
There it is.

2162
02:13:00,220 --> 02:13:04,539
People have been like minus twoing my like shitty dad jokes this whole time.

2163
02:13:05,500 --> 02:13:06,060
Plus two.

2164
02:13:06,060 --> 02:13:06,939
Can we get plus two?

2165
02:13:06,939 --> 02:13:10,699
That's unbelievable that I'm even seeing even five plus twos for that.

2166
02:13:12,060 --> 02:13:15,819
That's unbelievable.

2167
02:13:15,819 --> 02:13:21,869
I'm ready to go in.

2168
02:13:21,869 --> 02:13:22,189
Okay.

2169
02:13:22,189 --> 02:13:28,079
Now I'm going to freeze this and let this go.

2170
02:13:30,430 --> 02:13:33,500
I'm prepared to enter the room.

2171
02:13:37,310 --> 02:13:38,109
I need a box.

2172
02:13:38,109 --> 02:13:39,789
We all had the same exact idea.

2173
02:13:39,789 --> 02:13:40,430
That's funny.

2174
02:13:40,430 --> 02:13:40,989
Jump on me.

2175
02:13:41,630 --> 02:13:42,350
I want to be the box.

2176
02:13:43,869 --> 02:13:44,189
Yes.

2177
02:13:51,369 --> 02:13:52,250
Is that a different?

2178
02:13:52,250 --> 02:13:53,130
That one's like yellow.

2179
02:13:54,170 --> 02:13:54,970
Why is this one yellow?

2180
02:13:57,310 --> 02:13:57,789
It is.

2181
02:13:57,789 --> 02:13:58,590
No, it's not.

2182
02:13:58,590 --> 02:13:59,390
Is it?

2183
02:13:59,390 --> 02:14:00,109
I got them all.

2184
02:14:00,909 --> 02:14:01,310
Let's go.

2185
02:14:01,310 --> 02:14:12,920
Let me attach this to that.

2186
02:14:13,560 --> 02:14:16,000
Is that the wrong way?

2187
02:14:16,800 --> 02:14:17,920
It's not turning.

2188
02:14:17,920 --> 02:14:19,039
I think it has to go up.

2189
02:14:19,039 --> 02:14:19,920
But hold on.

2190
02:14:19,920 --> 02:14:20,720
Can I spin this?

2191
02:14:26,090 --> 02:14:26,329
No.

2192
02:14:26,890 --> 02:14:29,720
Can I pull this?

2193
02:14:29,720 --> 02:14:30,680
I can't like pull this.

2194
02:14:34,880 --> 02:14:35,279
Hold on.

2195
02:14:36,159 --> 02:14:37,000
I mean, I'm...

2196
02:14:38,279 --> 02:14:39,079
You got it.

2197
02:14:39,079 --> 02:14:40,279
But we have to open the door.

2198
02:14:40,279 --> 02:14:40,920
The door is open.

2199
02:14:42,119 --> 02:14:44,319
Wait, should I?

2200
02:14:44,319 --> 02:14:44,800
What?

2201
02:14:44,800 --> 02:14:45,520
Okay.

2202
02:14:45,520 --> 02:14:46,020
Cool.

2203
02:15:03,930 --> 02:15:04,649
Is that too far?

2204
02:15:04,649 --> 02:15:04,890
Sorry.

2205
02:15:13,229 --> 02:15:15,470
Hey, you know how like I lift the box up for you

2206
02:15:15,470 --> 02:15:16,270
and then you go ahead?

2207
02:15:16,270 --> 02:15:16,989
Can you like...

2208
02:15:16,989 --> 02:15:18,430
Can you get used to roping them

2209
02:15:18,430 --> 02:15:19,710
and maybe helping a wizard out?

2210
02:15:21,260 --> 02:15:21,659
Maybe.

2211
02:15:24,569 --> 02:15:25,210
I need...

2212
02:15:25,210 --> 02:15:27,210
We need to like pull this over here.

2213
02:15:27,210 --> 02:15:32,729
All right.

2214
02:15:32,729 --> 02:15:33,130
Do it.

2215
02:15:33,130 --> 02:15:34,329
Lift it up.

2216
02:15:34,329 --> 02:15:34,890
You're on it.

2217
02:15:34,890 --> 02:15:35,210
I can't.

2218
02:15:40,399 --> 02:15:40,960
Can you get this?

2219
02:15:43,050 --> 02:15:43,369
Yep.

2220
02:15:43,369 --> 02:15:43,850
Here we go.

2221
02:15:44,489 --> 02:15:44,890
Thank you.

2222
02:15:45,529 --> 02:15:46,170
Mm-hmm.

2223
02:15:46,170 --> 02:15:47,710
We have to...

2224
02:15:48,590 --> 02:15:48,909
Yeah.

2225
02:15:49,630 --> 02:15:56,350
How are you here?

2226
02:15:57,229 --> 02:15:57,789
What?

2227
02:15:57,789 --> 02:15:58,859
I've been here.

2228
02:15:59,659 --> 02:16:00,460
I've been here.

2229
02:16:01,659 --> 02:16:05,720
All right.

2230
02:16:05,720 --> 02:16:06,680
Can I get a little bit of a pop?

2231
02:16:07,319 --> 02:16:09,739
Oh, you want a little bit of a pop?

2232
02:16:09,739 --> 02:16:10,220
Oh, you got...

2233
02:16:10,220 --> 02:16:10,619
Oh, you got...

2234
02:16:10,619 --> 02:16:11,899
Oh, she's the box.

2235
02:16:11,899 --> 02:16:12,699
I'm the box.

2236
02:16:12,699 --> 02:16:12,939
All right.

2237
02:16:12,939 --> 02:16:13,979
But then how do you get up here?

2238
02:16:13,979 --> 02:16:14,539
We need to help.

2239
02:16:15,180 --> 02:16:15,899
Oh, there you go.

2240
02:16:17,439 --> 02:16:18,079
Uh-oh.

2241
02:16:18,079 --> 02:16:18,399
Fighting.

2242
02:16:18,399 --> 02:16:19,199
This is my realm.

2243
02:16:22,220 --> 02:16:23,500
He shot my box out of the air.

2244
02:16:24,300 --> 02:16:24,619
That did?

2245
02:16:26,039 --> 02:16:27,319
He's anti-airing my box.

2246
02:16:27,960 --> 02:16:29,470
Well, now he's frozen.

2247
02:16:30,029 --> 02:16:30,750
Freeze.

2248
02:16:30,750 --> 02:16:31,390
Head box.

2249
02:16:32,030 --> 02:16:36,040
Oh, it's off the screen.

2250
02:16:37,079 --> 02:16:38,489
Sick.

2251
02:16:39,209 --> 02:16:39,450
No!

2252
02:16:40,489 --> 02:16:42,620
The platform is gone.

2253
02:16:43,340 --> 02:16:45,440
Yep.

2254
02:16:46,399 --> 02:16:48,000
I feel like there's something else up here.

2255
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:50,940
Screenshot that and read it later.

2256
02:16:50,940 --> 02:16:52,860
Nope.

2257
02:16:52,860 --> 02:16:56,170
I think we should be reading other people's mail.

2258
02:16:56,170 --> 02:16:57,370
It's kind of weird.

2259
02:16:57,370 --> 02:16:58,569
It was mail for you.

2260
02:16:59,610 --> 02:17:02,969
But we got like this really important looking letter in the mail for somebody else.

2261
02:17:04,010 --> 02:17:05,129
We still haven't given it.

2262
02:17:06,430 --> 02:17:06,909
Oh, yeah.

2263
02:17:07,950 --> 02:17:09,319
It's like open immediately.

2264
02:17:09,399 --> 02:17:10,280
Why did that just happen?

2265
02:17:10,280 --> 02:17:13,159
That's actually a lawsuit letter sent to us for someone else.

2266
02:17:14,120 --> 02:17:15,319
Oh, my God.

2267
02:17:15,319 --> 02:17:15,559
All right.

2268
02:17:15,559 --> 02:17:15,799
There.

2269
02:17:16,760 --> 02:17:20,799
It's not my fault the postman doesn't understand what numbers are.

2270
02:17:28,430 --> 02:17:30,270
Isn't that the first thing you learn as a mailman?

2271
02:17:31,469 --> 02:17:33,229
This is a long ass level.

2272
02:17:35,520 --> 02:17:35,840
Right?

2273
02:17:36,879 --> 02:17:37,680
I can freeze that.

2274
02:17:37,680 --> 02:17:38,239
Pull it back up.

2275
02:17:38,959 --> 02:17:42,479
Put it in like a good spot.

2276
02:17:52,190 --> 02:17:55,709
Now I think we're good.

2277
02:17:58,459 --> 02:17:58,700
Nice.

2278
02:17:58,700 --> 02:18:00,059
I want that ability.

2279
02:18:00,139 --> 02:18:02,780
No, it looks like fun.

2280
02:18:02,780 --> 02:18:06,440
No smash.

2281
02:18:06,440 --> 02:18:13,239
Oh, I found a player to continue waiting for just waiting for the drops of virgin blood there.

2282
02:18:14,040 --> 02:18:14,680
What did you get?

2283
02:18:15,479 --> 02:18:16,360
That's actually a lot.

2284
02:18:19,899 --> 02:18:23,100
It must be upsetting to see what happened while you were away.

2285
02:18:23,100 --> 02:18:27,450
My nightmares ruin this castle.

2286
02:18:27,450 --> 02:18:30,969
It's why I was sent away and locked up in the dungeons of the Astral Academy.

2287
02:18:31,770 --> 02:18:35,100
Let's do them all.

2288
02:18:35,739 --> 02:18:36,540
You have the changer.

2289
02:18:37,340 --> 02:18:41,530
Oh, it's best you let me go.

2290
02:18:42,250 --> 02:18:44,510
Will you leave me behind?

2291
02:18:45,389 --> 02:18:45,870
That's me.

2292
02:18:46,829 --> 02:18:47,709
He said do them all.

2293
02:18:47,709 --> 02:18:48,350
I'm trying.

2294
02:18:50,510 --> 02:18:53,159
No, there's one way.

2295
02:18:53,159 --> 02:18:55,389
I just I give up.

2296
02:18:56,409 --> 02:19:04,520
Hey, breaking the gym.

2297
02:19:04,520 --> 02:19:10,639
Old reference skip skip skip.

2298
02:19:10,639 --> 02:19:11,139
Hey.

2299
02:19:12,159 --> 02:19:13,440
Oh, no.

2300
02:19:13,440 --> 02:19:14,239
Are we here again?

2301
02:19:15,120 --> 02:19:17,520
Tell me this is the whole game is one just long level.

2302
02:19:18,959 --> 02:19:20,159
We're in the dream world.

2303
02:19:27,399 --> 02:19:30,479
I was the only one not doing voices today.

2304
02:19:34,829 --> 02:19:35,309
Are you sure?

2305
02:19:43,819 --> 02:19:46,219
I can't actually just spit all of my screen.

2306
02:19:48,780 --> 02:20:01,209
No, it's so so impatient teleportation.

2307
02:20:03,209 --> 02:20:04,569
Ooh, that's cool.

2308
02:20:04,569 --> 02:20:05,069
Wow.

2309
02:20:06,569 --> 02:20:07,290
Cool.

2310
02:20:07,290 --> 02:20:10,639
Wait, this is where it gets a little weird.

2311
02:20:17,420 --> 02:20:17,920
You good?

2312
02:20:18,299 --> 02:20:19,620
I'm good.

2313
02:20:20,649 --> 02:20:22,090
Wow, the castle brand new.

2314
02:20:22,090 --> 02:20:24,329
It has all the old cobwebs back.

2315
02:20:28,940 --> 02:20:31,819
I stopped listening to everything he was saying like 40 minutes ago.

2316
02:20:31,819 --> 02:20:32,780
I don't know what he said.

2317
02:20:33,739 --> 02:20:40,159
You get out of my dream.

2318
02:20:44,170 --> 02:20:46,809
And he's just a Charlie Brown adult right now.

2319
02:20:46,809 --> 02:20:48,170
I don't I no idea what he's saying.

2320
02:20:49,209 --> 02:20:53,260
And me and Ashley.

2321
02:20:54,139 --> 02:20:56,670
I mean, actually, just do this puzzle.

2322
02:20:57,309 --> 02:20:58,270
So I'm going to freeze it.

2323
02:20:59,149 --> 02:21:01,120
Does that freeze?

2324
02:21:01,920 --> 02:21:03,979
What about down below?

2325
02:21:08,989 --> 02:21:10,190
The door doesn't stay open.

2326
02:21:13,639 --> 02:21:16,120
Here, we're going to get off of it.

2327
02:21:16,120 --> 02:21:16,840
You're muted again.

2328
02:21:17,399 --> 02:21:19,319
Can I freeze it when it's open or closed?

2329
02:21:20,840 --> 02:21:21,399
Yeah, you are.

2330
02:21:23,000 --> 02:21:23,879
There's a double mirror.

2331
02:21:32,280 --> 02:21:34,360
No, it's my box puzzle.

2332
02:21:35,319 --> 02:21:35,639
Fine.

2333
02:21:35,639 --> 02:21:36,760
It's your box.

2334
02:21:37,479 --> 02:21:39,879
I didn't need you something in the water.

2335
02:21:41,159 --> 02:21:41,659
Whoa.

2336
02:21:45,149 --> 02:21:46,829
Oh, don't touch the floor's lava.

2337
02:21:46,829 --> 02:21:47,629
The floor's lava.

2338
02:21:47,629 --> 02:21:47,950
It is.

2339
02:21:47,950 --> 02:21:48,909
I just proved it.

2340
02:21:52,479 --> 02:21:53,840
Oh, you got to pull this table.

2341
02:21:54,479 --> 02:21:56,459
What about those?

2342
02:21:58,190 --> 02:21:59,469
Oh, you want them?

2343
02:21:59,469 --> 02:21:59,969
Yeah.

2344
02:22:03,239 --> 02:22:03,739
Too far.

2345
02:22:04,920 --> 02:22:05,420
No.

2346
02:22:06,040 --> 02:22:09,079
OK, now I need something to attach this to in front of us.

2347
02:22:11,079 --> 02:22:12,520
Because then you're going to move it.

2348
02:22:12,520 --> 02:22:13,079
Check this out.

2349
02:22:13,079 --> 02:22:14,120
Now you're going to move it forward.

2350
02:22:15,159 --> 02:22:17,559
Oh, I thought that was going to be it.

2351
02:22:18,620 --> 02:22:20,379
I mean, hold on.

2352
02:22:20,379 --> 02:22:21,739
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.

2353
02:22:23,340 --> 02:22:25,739
Just connect it to the box, not the hook.

2354
02:22:26,540 --> 02:22:27,340
Unconnect hook.

2355
02:22:27,899 --> 02:22:29,899
OK.

2356
02:22:29,899 --> 02:22:30,860
Now connect the box.

2357
02:22:31,579 --> 02:22:33,340
Well, you said connect to the box.

2358
02:22:33,340 --> 02:22:33,979
Yeah, now connect.

2359
02:22:34,940 --> 02:22:35,440
OK.

2360
02:22:37,280 --> 02:22:38,719
You're trying to make a bridge with this.

2361
02:22:38,719 --> 02:22:40,079
Yeah, I'm trying to make a bridge.

2362
02:22:40,079 --> 02:22:41,600
OK, well, you go then move it forward.

2363
02:22:42,399 --> 02:22:43,520
Ashley's on top of it.

2364
02:22:43,520 --> 02:22:44,079
I can't.

2365
02:22:44,079 --> 02:22:44,879
I'm on the box.

2366
02:22:44,879 --> 02:22:46,079
You can't do it.

2367
02:22:46,079 --> 02:22:46,639
Hold on.

2368
02:22:46,639 --> 02:22:47,840
If I attach it to this, you...

2369
02:22:48,719 --> 02:22:50,079
What the fuck just happened there?

2370
02:22:50,879 --> 02:22:52,219
That's another box.

2371
02:22:52,219 --> 02:22:52,860
Yeah, OK, now.

2372
02:22:54,139 --> 02:22:55,340
Damn, we don't need any of this shit.

2373
02:22:56,059 --> 02:23:01,959
I just had a plan and you know what to work.

2374
02:23:04,840 --> 02:23:06,120
You shouldn't even need my box.

2375
02:23:06,840 --> 02:23:10,110
I need another weight.

2376
02:23:10,750 --> 02:23:11,549
No, that's fine.

2377
02:23:13,920 --> 02:23:14,719
Oh, fuck.

2378
02:23:14,719 --> 02:23:15,520
It didn't go all the way.

2379
02:23:16,319 --> 02:23:17,280
I already have that one iced,

2380
02:23:17,840 --> 02:23:20,639
but I guess I'll do this one instead.

2381
02:23:21,360 --> 02:23:23,879
Oh, shit.

2382
02:23:26,540 --> 02:23:27,180
Oh.

2383
02:23:27,340 --> 02:23:28,540
What the fuck was that?

2384
02:23:29,659 --> 02:23:29,979
Ow.

2385
02:23:29,979 --> 02:23:30,459
That was me.

2386
02:23:32,299 --> 02:23:37,340
I helped.

2387
02:23:37,340 --> 02:23:39,739
Some of the portals can be levitated and rotated.

2388
02:23:40,299 --> 02:23:42,620
Hey, new mechanic for you.

2389
02:23:49,290 --> 02:23:50,649
All right, now just do the portal thing.

2390
02:23:50,649 --> 02:23:51,770
You have to do the portal thing at least once.

2391
02:23:54,010 --> 02:23:54,510
Let me go.

2392
02:24:00,200 --> 02:24:09,360
Flip it over.

2393
02:24:09,360 --> 02:24:10,879
You guys, you got to go into the other one.

2394
02:24:11,440 --> 02:24:12,319
Yeah, but how do we do that?

2395
02:24:12,319 --> 02:24:13,280
Hey, we need a box.

2396
02:24:13,920 --> 02:24:15,520
Look, this is a total wizard level.

2397
02:24:15,520 --> 02:24:16,399
Look at this.

2398
02:24:16,399 --> 02:24:17,120
All right, you ready?

2399
02:24:17,840 --> 02:24:21,680
How come my ability is only for one level?

2400
02:24:22,239 --> 02:24:23,280
It's probably introducing it,

2401
02:24:23,280 --> 02:24:24,799
so it's going to be here for the rest of the time.

2402
02:24:25,920 --> 02:24:28,809
I want to be cool.

2403
02:24:29,690 --> 02:24:31,290
Are we open the door?

2404
02:24:33,290 --> 02:24:34,170
You need to move that.

2405
02:24:35,049 --> 02:24:35,770
I can't.

2406
02:24:35,770 --> 02:24:37,610
Only some portals can be moved.

2407
02:24:37,610 --> 02:24:37,850
No, no.

2408
02:24:37,850 --> 02:24:38,889
What about the box through the wall?

2409
02:24:38,889 --> 02:24:39,930
Can you box through the wall?

2410
02:24:41,479 --> 02:24:41,879
Thank you.

2411
02:24:43,319 --> 02:24:44,440
And then Ashley needs to.

2412
02:24:47,260 --> 02:24:48,860
I don't know how you can get it up, though.

2413
02:24:49,819 --> 02:24:51,229
I can do it higher.

2414
02:24:54,000 --> 02:24:54,639
What?

2415
02:24:54,639 --> 02:24:55,120
Freeze it.

2416
02:24:55,120 --> 02:24:55,600
I hit shift.

2417
02:24:56,239 --> 02:24:58,000
No, you can't freeze airborne things.

2418
02:24:58,559 --> 02:24:58,879
Higher.

2419
02:25:01,290 --> 02:25:01,850
There we go.

2420
02:25:04,239 --> 02:25:05,360
We can just get in.

2421
02:25:06,000 --> 02:25:06,799
But why?

2422
02:25:06,799 --> 02:25:08,559
Well, we can go top left.

2423
02:25:08,559 --> 02:25:10,159
That was like the whole reason there was a wall.

2424
02:25:10,879 --> 02:25:12,399
Okay, no, actually charge through that.

2425
02:25:14,729 --> 02:25:15,770
Like charge through the portal.

2426
02:25:16,729 --> 02:25:17,530
Oh, okay.

2427
02:25:18,489 --> 02:25:20,889
For some reason, I thought that was too much to cross.

2428
02:25:22,569 --> 02:25:23,209
I have no idea.

2429
02:25:26,940 --> 02:25:28,780
Why do we move?

2430
02:25:30,139 --> 02:25:31,500
I think these things spawned in.

2431
02:25:32,299 --> 02:25:34,139
It took a long time to spawn.

2432
02:25:34,139 --> 02:25:34,620
Where am I?

2433
02:25:37,200 --> 02:25:37,680
Got him.

2434
02:25:43,600 --> 02:25:43,840
Yeah.

2435
02:25:45,440 --> 02:25:46,159
All right, freeze it.

2436
02:25:48,409 --> 02:25:50,090
But this can be rotated, though, right?

2437
02:25:51,899 --> 02:25:54,459
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2438
02:25:58,010 --> 02:25:58,489
I'll get it.

2439
02:26:01,840 --> 02:26:02,639
I'll get it.

2440
02:26:02,639 --> 02:26:04,000
That wasn't that funny.

2441
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:05,200
Wasn't that funny.

2442
02:26:05,200 --> 02:26:06,239
It can't be rotated.

2443
02:26:06,799 --> 02:26:08,479
So freeze it.

2444
02:26:08,959 --> 02:26:09,360
Unblock.

2445
02:26:11,680 --> 02:26:13,200
Sometimes it's just that simple, isn't it?

2446
02:26:16,889 --> 02:26:18,170
Sometimes it's that simple.

2447
02:26:18,729 --> 02:26:19,209
Sometimes.

2448
02:26:19,930 --> 02:26:21,129
Not every time, but sometimes.

2449
02:26:21,770 --> 02:26:22,889
And it was funny.

2450
02:26:23,450 --> 02:26:24,250
I don't want to hear it.

2451
02:26:25,770 --> 02:26:28,989
All right, this is your puzzle, Steve.

2452
02:26:28,989 --> 02:26:29,870
Here we go.

2453
02:26:29,870 --> 02:26:31,469
I'm going to stand over here and hide.

2454
02:26:33,129 --> 02:26:33,930
And then blink.

2455
02:26:33,930 --> 02:26:34,569
And not help.

2456
02:26:34,569 --> 02:26:35,850
Is he how spiteful she is?

2457
02:26:36,569 --> 02:26:38,090
You say like one thing one time,

2458
02:26:38,090 --> 02:26:40,090
and then she like holds it over you for the rest of your life.

2459
02:26:40,729 --> 02:26:43,370
That's what marriage is, it's my job.

2460
02:26:43,370 --> 02:26:44,489
But there's a cool thing over there.

2461
02:26:44,489 --> 02:26:44,889
Be accountable.

2462
02:26:48,430 --> 02:26:49,389
This is a cool level.

2463
02:26:49,389 --> 02:26:50,750
I just like the way it looks inside.

2464
02:26:51,629 --> 02:26:53,260
Can I get a box so I can...

2465
02:26:53,979 --> 02:26:55,500
Yeah, this is all you.

2466
02:26:56,139 --> 02:26:58,940
This actually is like just a wizard portion of the game.

2467
02:27:00,239 --> 02:27:00,719
Hold on.

2468
02:27:01,899 --> 02:27:02,700
I'm confused.

2469
02:27:03,739 --> 02:27:05,579
We'll see how long it takes for you to do it.

2470
02:27:05,579 --> 02:27:09,879
Well, wait, wait, wait.

2471
02:27:09,879 --> 02:27:10,520
Ashley, you're...

2472
02:27:11,639 --> 02:27:14,139
I cannot freeze these, can I?

2473
02:27:14,940 --> 02:27:18,489
If I can shoot through.

2474
02:27:20,329 --> 02:27:22,969
I don't think that does anything for us right now.

2475
02:27:22,969 --> 02:27:23,690
Where do I put it?

2476
02:27:23,690 --> 02:27:25,450
My brain is broken right now.

2477
02:27:25,450 --> 02:27:26,889
I can't think, where do I put it?

2478
02:27:27,530 --> 02:27:30,250
All right, so listen, let me help you out here.

2479
02:27:30,250 --> 02:27:31,049
So, okay, so...

2480
02:27:31,049 --> 02:27:31,690
Flip it around.

2481
02:27:32,969 --> 02:27:33,610
I can't do it.

2482
02:27:33,610 --> 02:27:35,049
It doesn't work that way, Ashley.

2483
02:27:35,049 --> 02:27:37,209
Hold on, someone's driving a car into my house.

2484
02:27:37,209 --> 02:27:37,930
Let me give me a second.

2485
02:27:38,729 --> 02:27:41,370
Okay, yeah, you just had it.

2486
02:27:43,690 --> 02:27:44,649
Ashley, if you angle it...

2487
02:27:44,649 --> 02:27:45,610
Yeah, angle it a little bit.

2488
02:27:46,489 --> 02:27:47,530
Oh, that doesn't matter.

2489
02:27:47,530 --> 02:27:49,290
Oh, it was working a second ago.

2490
02:27:50,409 --> 02:27:53,280
Yeah, I can't do that.

2491
02:27:53,280 --> 02:27:53,840
There you go.

2492
02:27:53,840 --> 02:27:54,639
I can do that.

2493
02:27:54,639 --> 02:27:56,879
I can do that.

2494
02:27:56,879 --> 02:27:57,760
Fuck, dude.

2495
02:27:59,040 --> 02:28:00,059
Oh, your box.

2496
02:28:00,059 --> 02:28:01,500
Fuck, you guys are so bad at this game.

2497
02:28:01,500 --> 02:28:02,540
Like, I'm missing dinner now.

2498
02:28:02,540 --> 02:28:04,399
What?

2499
02:28:04,399 --> 02:28:05,280
You don't deserve dinner.

2500
02:28:05,280 --> 02:28:06,319
What is that even from?

2501
02:28:06,879 --> 02:28:07,760
When did I say that?

2502
02:28:07,760 --> 02:28:09,920
I had to have said that recently for you to capture it.

2503
02:28:10,719 --> 02:28:12,319
That was a clip that's...

2504
02:28:12,319 --> 02:28:12,819
Yeah.

2505
02:28:25,959 --> 02:28:29,719
No, it was the BA toxic Overwatch player thing, right?

2506
02:28:29,719 --> 02:28:31,399
You, like, want it to do it.

2507
02:28:31,399 --> 02:28:35,079
And it was right before we had played Dwarf Game.

2508
02:28:35,719 --> 02:28:38,540
Oh, no, somebody Ashley dot, dot, dotted me.

2509
02:28:40,889 --> 02:28:42,889
Oh, well, like, okay, I guess this works.

2510
02:28:43,690 --> 02:28:46,780
Why does this game even bother with combat?

2511
02:28:47,879 --> 02:28:48,360
You know what?

2512
02:28:48,360 --> 02:28:50,440
That is actually a really good question.

2513
02:28:50,440 --> 02:28:52,520
What's the point of even fighting stuff in this game?

2514
02:28:53,319 --> 02:28:54,120
Filler.

2515
02:28:54,120 --> 02:28:55,079
Is it just...

2516
02:28:55,079 --> 02:28:56,600
It's extreme filler, right?

2517
02:28:56,600 --> 02:28:57,000
It has to...

2518
02:28:57,000 --> 02:28:57,239
That's...

2519
02:28:57,239 --> 02:28:58,520
I don't know.

2520
02:28:58,520 --> 02:29:00,040
It breaks up the action a bit.

2521
02:29:00,040 --> 02:29:00,520
I guess.

2522
02:29:01,239 --> 02:29:04,920
I mean, if it was any way challenging, it'd be all right.

2523
02:29:05,479 --> 02:29:07,079
But this game only has easy and normal.

2524
02:29:07,719 --> 02:29:10,559
All right, Steve, look.

2525
02:29:10,559 --> 02:29:11,059
Oracle.

2526
02:29:11,600 --> 02:29:13,079
It's your playground.

2527
02:29:13,079 --> 02:29:14,120
Where is it going to?

2528
02:29:14,600 --> 02:29:15,319
Oh, in there?

2529
02:29:17,129 --> 02:29:20,729
Well, I have access to put like a rope bridge.

2530
02:29:20,729 --> 02:29:22,879
So there's one.

2531
02:29:23,760 --> 02:29:25,790
All right, so it has to stay.

2532
02:29:25,790 --> 02:29:26,350
So hold on.

2533
02:29:26,989 --> 02:29:27,549
Do that again.

2534
02:29:29,639 --> 02:29:29,959
Shit.

2535
02:29:29,959 --> 02:29:30,120
Can I, like...

2536
02:29:30,120 --> 02:29:31,479
Just keep jumping on my box.

2537
02:29:32,120 --> 02:29:33,469
Sorry, it's so tempting.

2538
02:29:34,030 --> 02:29:34,590
Let me...

2539
02:29:34,590 --> 02:29:35,469
I can't freeze the door.

2540
02:29:36,510 --> 02:29:38,829
Just stack them up so it's high enough.

2541
02:29:40,059 --> 02:29:41,659
Get another of these.

2542
02:29:42,219 --> 02:29:44,059
All right, just put the boxes on top of the boxes.

2543
02:29:46,379 --> 02:29:49,819
Put boxes on top of the box?

2544
02:29:50,940 --> 02:29:53,739
And just stack them up and then just make the angle right.

2545
02:29:54,379 --> 02:29:56,379
But you got to have it be the right one on the right angle.

2546
02:29:57,879 --> 02:29:59,000
Oh, that didn't work.

2547
02:30:01,739 --> 02:30:03,979
The third box has to be the one doing it.

2548
02:30:10,860 --> 02:30:11,420
Oh, okay.

2549
02:30:11,420 --> 02:30:12,059
So then wait.

2550
02:30:12,059 --> 02:30:12,459
Hold on.

2551
02:30:17,000 --> 02:30:17,559
Just go up.

2552
02:30:17,559 --> 02:30:18,600
Just climb up.

2553
02:30:18,600 --> 02:30:19,000
Oh.

2554
02:30:19,000 --> 02:30:19,799
But what about you guys?

2555
02:30:20,520 --> 02:30:21,520
Figure it out.

2556
02:30:22,159 --> 02:30:24,750
I mean, I can put the rope up.

2557
02:30:25,309 --> 02:30:28,000
I guess it's still working.

2558
02:30:29,360 --> 02:30:30,319
I guess.

2559
02:30:30,319 --> 02:30:30,719
Whatever.

2560
02:30:36,639 --> 02:30:37,760
Dot, dot, dot.

2561
02:30:38,719 --> 02:30:41,469
Maybe it means we have a dungeon down there.

2562
02:30:41,469 --> 02:30:42,030
It's lore.

2563
02:30:42,030 --> 02:30:44,030
No, there were things up there.

2564
02:30:44,030 --> 02:30:44,670
Were there?

2565
02:30:44,670 --> 02:30:45,549
Well, I...

2566
02:30:45,549 --> 02:30:46,110
I'm sorry.

2567
02:30:47,069 --> 02:30:48,750
Oh, no.

2568
02:30:48,750 --> 02:30:49,870
Elevator fight sequence.

2569
02:30:49,870 --> 02:30:50,989
Oh, what are we going to do?

2570
02:30:51,950 --> 02:30:55,360
Quick a bunch.

2571
02:30:55,360 --> 02:30:56,479
I'm going to do fire on this one.

2572
02:30:56,479 --> 02:30:57,440
It's going to feel like it's cool.

2573
02:30:58,079 --> 02:30:58,719
Yep.

2574
02:30:58,719 --> 02:30:59,280
Never mind.

2575
02:31:06,760 --> 02:31:07,559
We just have to move.

2576
02:31:09,239 --> 02:31:10,280
What about this?

2577
02:31:10,280 --> 02:31:12,620
There was a terrible old scare over here.

2578
02:31:12,620 --> 02:31:14,350
There are a lot of secrets in this game, though.

2579
02:31:16,219 --> 02:31:17,659
What do I do?

2580
02:31:17,659 --> 02:31:19,020
You missed a door with a hookah.

2581
02:31:19,659 --> 02:31:20,299
Door with a hookah.

2582
02:31:21,899 --> 02:31:22,540
Door with a hookah?

2583
02:31:23,100 --> 02:31:23,899
It can be opened?

2584
02:31:24,540 --> 02:31:26,219
I'm pulling.

2585
02:31:27,360 --> 02:31:27,680
Oh.

2586
02:31:27,680 --> 02:31:28,479
It goes up.

2587
02:31:29,200 --> 02:31:29,440
Okay.

2588
02:31:29,440 --> 02:31:30,319
So, yeah.

2589
02:31:30,319 --> 02:31:31,920
Just give me a boost.

2590
02:31:35,319 --> 02:31:36,280
Get off the box.

2591
02:31:36,280 --> 02:31:37,879
Just let me pull the wire up.

2592
02:31:40,000 --> 02:31:40,399
What do you mean?

2593
02:31:41,280 --> 02:31:42,000
Oh, I see what you mean.

2594
02:31:42,000 --> 02:31:42,239
Okay.

2595
02:31:44,600 --> 02:31:45,079
Okay.

2596
02:31:45,079 --> 02:31:45,879
I don't think that works.

2597
02:31:46,520 --> 02:31:47,479
That has always worked.

2598
02:31:50,760 --> 02:31:52,040
It was for a second there, see?

2599
02:31:54,459 --> 02:31:55,739
Why are we on different planes?

2600
02:31:57,280 --> 02:31:58,079
Yeah, see, now it's...

2601
02:31:58,639 --> 02:32:00,989
Okay.

2602
02:32:00,989 --> 02:32:01,790
Never mind.

2603
02:32:01,790 --> 02:32:02,989
But we have to get in here, though.

2604
02:32:03,549 --> 02:32:04,030
We do.

2605
02:32:04,030 --> 02:32:05,149
You have to get in here.

2606
02:32:05,149 --> 02:32:05,709
It's taunting me.

2607
02:32:07,709 --> 02:32:09,260
Put your shield up.

2608
02:32:09,819 --> 02:32:19,069
No, I can't yank it up.

2609
02:32:22,079 --> 02:32:23,659
We were doing it before.

2610
02:32:24,379 --> 02:32:25,420
I could have made it in.

2611
02:32:25,420 --> 02:32:27,260
Try to do the thing where you push me up again.

2612
02:32:30,329 --> 02:32:31,610
It's kind of working a little.

2613
02:32:32,489 --> 02:32:33,049
It's staying.

2614
02:32:33,770 --> 02:32:34,959
All right.

2615
02:32:34,959 --> 02:32:35,200
Keep going.

2616
02:32:35,200 --> 02:32:36,000
Come on, game.

2617
02:32:38,170 --> 02:32:39,290
Come on, game.

2618
02:32:39,290 --> 02:32:40,569
Just brute force it.

2619
02:32:40,569 --> 02:32:40,809
All right.

2620
02:32:40,809 --> 02:32:41,290
Do it again.

2621
02:32:43,200 --> 02:32:43,520
All right.

2622
02:32:43,520 --> 02:32:43,920
Get in.

2623
02:32:44,559 --> 02:32:44,959
Get in.

2624
02:32:46,719 --> 02:32:47,120
Freeze it.

2625
02:32:48,000 --> 02:32:48,879
Was that it?

2626
02:32:49,600 --> 02:32:50,000
Freeze it.

2627
02:32:50,000 --> 02:32:51,200
I think that was it.

2628
02:32:51,200 --> 02:32:51,680
Freeze it.

2629
02:32:52,239 --> 02:32:53,069
I got it.

2630
02:32:53,069 --> 02:32:53,950
I think that was it.

2631
02:32:53,950 --> 02:32:54,270
No.

2632
02:32:54,270 --> 02:32:55,389
I can even go in now.

2633
02:32:55,389 --> 02:32:56,350
You can't even go in there.

2634
02:32:56,350 --> 02:32:57,469
I froze the door closed.

2635
02:32:58,350 --> 02:32:59,069
Good job.

2636
02:32:59,069 --> 02:32:59,469
No, but this...

2637
02:32:59,469 --> 02:33:00,590
You did that before, too.

2638
02:33:02,780 --> 02:33:03,340
Oh, whatever.

2639
02:33:03,340 --> 02:33:04,379
Someone else will get it one day.

2640
02:33:04,940 --> 02:33:08,360
The next set of adventures.

2641
02:33:08,920 --> 02:33:09,239
Yeah.

2642
02:33:09,799 --> 02:33:10,600
Someone else will do it.

2643
02:33:11,639 --> 02:33:12,040
Later.

2644
02:33:14,670 --> 02:33:15,069
Oh, God.

2645
02:33:17,309 --> 02:33:17,950
All right.

2646
02:33:17,950 --> 02:33:19,069
I'm just going to do it regular.

2647
02:33:25,549 --> 02:33:26,590
Wait, what?

2648
02:33:26,590 --> 02:33:28,350
Oh, you've lowered the poison.

2649
02:33:28,989 --> 02:33:36,010
But we didn't even go in here.

2650
02:33:36,010 --> 02:33:36,969
Look at the stuff in here.

2651
02:33:37,850 --> 02:33:38,090
Where?

2652
02:33:38,969 --> 02:33:39,450
There's three...

2653
02:33:44,440 --> 02:33:44,920
You got them?

2654
02:34:00,030 --> 02:34:00,350
Okay.

2655
02:34:00,350 --> 02:34:01,069
Well, we're over here.

2656
02:34:02,110 --> 02:34:04,030
And then I think now you have to spin this

2657
02:34:04,750 --> 02:34:06,989
so we can jump into it and launch ourselves up.

2658
02:34:07,709 --> 02:34:09,129
Mm hmm.

2659
02:34:09,129 --> 02:34:12,860
Can you do it?

2660
02:34:12,860 --> 02:34:14,139
Now you're thinking with PODL.

2661
02:34:15,100 --> 02:34:19,469
Now you have to go up this door and go to the right.

2662
02:34:20,510 --> 02:34:21,549
Now you have to fight a wolf.

2663
02:34:23,709 --> 02:34:25,389
Hey, Nightmare Wolf.

2664
02:34:25,389 --> 02:34:30,670
Hey, Wolf.

2665
02:34:30,670 --> 02:34:31,149
Whoa.

2666
02:34:31,149 --> 02:34:31,389
What?

2667
02:34:32,989 --> 02:34:34,510
Were you just doing that?

2668
02:34:34,510 --> 02:34:34,829
Yeah.

2669
02:34:35,959 --> 02:34:37,719
That's my cool ability that I unlock

2670
02:34:37,719 --> 02:34:40,280
is moving the pointless enemies around.

2671
02:34:40,920 --> 02:34:41,559
I froze it.

2672
02:34:41,559 --> 02:34:41,879
Sorry.

2673
02:34:43,000 --> 02:34:52,430
What are you trying to do here?

2674
02:34:55,819 --> 02:34:57,340
Yeah, I can't put a box there.

2675
02:34:57,340 --> 02:34:58,540
No box guy.

2676
02:34:58,540 --> 02:35:01,819
Well, you guys are now down there

2677
02:35:02,780 --> 02:35:03,579
and you get across

2678
02:35:05,079 --> 02:35:06,040
and then you can get across

2679
02:35:06,680 --> 02:35:08,520
and then I can get across because of this.

2680
02:35:09,319 --> 02:35:10,440
I can grab this thing.

2681
02:35:11,239 --> 02:35:12,360
Just give me a box for a second.

2682
02:35:17,690 --> 02:35:18,010
Fuck.

2683
02:35:18,569 --> 02:35:19,129
Fuck.

2684
02:35:19,129 --> 02:35:20,250
You need to be on the ledge.

2685
02:35:22,700 --> 02:35:25,739
I have to make a bridge like that.

2686
02:35:25,739 --> 02:35:26,860
Oopsie daisy.

2687
02:35:26,860 --> 02:35:27,260
Oopsie.

2688
02:35:29,309 --> 02:35:30,030
I can't really.

2689
02:35:30,030 --> 02:35:30,989
Oh, now I can.

2690
02:35:30,989 --> 02:35:31,549
Oopsie.

2691
02:35:32,510 --> 02:35:33,389
I don't know how to help you.

2692
02:35:35,739 --> 02:35:38,459
Jerma probably does not remember that he can roll.

2693
02:35:38,459 --> 02:35:39,420
I know how to help you.

2694
02:35:39,420 --> 02:35:40,459
I can put a box on that.

2695
02:35:40,459 --> 02:35:42,700
Wait, why is that coming out like halfway?

2696
02:35:43,579 --> 02:35:44,139
Oh, yeah, yeah.

2697
02:35:44,139 --> 02:35:45,100
You put the box down there.

2698
02:35:45,100 --> 02:35:45,260
All right.

2699
02:35:45,260 --> 02:35:45,739
Lift it up.

2700
02:35:46,379 --> 02:35:46,860
Press button.

2701
02:35:47,930 --> 02:35:48,170
Okay.

2702
02:35:48,170 --> 02:35:48,569
Now wait.

2703
02:35:49,690 --> 02:35:50,010
Hold on.

2704
02:35:50,409 --> 02:35:51,209
This is going to be hard.

2705
02:35:52,090 --> 02:35:53,770
Oh, you can just go down the second thing.

2706
02:35:54,649 --> 02:35:55,610
That's what I'm trying to do.

2707
02:35:55,610 --> 02:35:57,209
I forgot Jerma could roll too.

2708
02:35:57,209 --> 02:35:58,489
Why does he get to roll?

2709
02:35:58,489 --> 02:35:58,809
Okay.

2710
02:35:58,809 --> 02:35:59,370
Now do it again.

2711
02:36:00,090 --> 02:36:00,489
Thank you.

2712
02:36:01,520 --> 02:36:01,760
Now.

2713
02:36:03,739 --> 02:36:04,059
Thank you.

2714
02:36:05,370 --> 02:36:05,770
No, no, no.

2715
02:36:05,770 --> 02:36:06,809
Put it over here where I can do it.

2716
02:36:06,809 --> 02:36:08,569
You can just roll from box to hook.

2717
02:36:09,290 --> 02:36:11,360
What if it falls?

2718
02:36:12,319 --> 02:36:13,920
Well, you look cooler that way.

2719
02:36:14,719 --> 02:36:15,120
Yeah, I know.

2720
02:36:15,120 --> 02:36:19,520
I can roll, but I roll into a waterfall.

2721
02:36:20,399 --> 02:36:20,639
Water.

2722
02:36:20,639 --> 02:36:20,959
I don't know.

2723
02:36:20,959 --> 02:36:21,280
Whatever.

2724
02:36:21,280 --> 02:36:21,680
I don't know.

2725
02:36:22,719 --> 02:36:30,059
Yeah.

2726
02:36:30,059 --> 02:36:30,620
How funny.

2727
02:36:30,620 --> 02:36:31,420
How can you do that?

2728
02:36:31,420 --> 02:36:31,659
Huh?

2729
02:36:32,379 --> 02:36:35,579
I mean, I know I have to roll, but the roll doesn't give me like extra.

2730
02:36:36,139 --> 02:36:37,420
Like I can roll like this.

2731
02:36:38,059 --> 02:36:41,260
But if I was ready, like I just roll into the arm.

2732
02:36:41,260 --> 02:36:42,299
What are you guys saying?

2733
02:36:42,299 --> 02:36:42,860
I want to roll.

2734
02:36:42,860 --> 02:36:43,899
I've been rolling around the whole time.

2735
02:36:44,700 --> 02:36:50,270
It doesn't give me like extra momentum.

2736
02:36:54,540 --> 02:36:54,780
All right.

2737
02:36:54,780 --> 02:36:55,500
You do that again.

2738
02:36:55,500 --> 02:36:57,020
I'm going to do the SpongeBob laugh again.

2739
02:36:57,020 --> 02:37:00,059
And everyone's going to be pissed at you because you made that happen.

2740
02:37:00,059 --> 02:37:01,899
I haven't heard you do the SpongeBob laugh.

2741
02:37:03,020 --> 02:37:06,239
Oh my God.

2742
02:37:06,239 --> 02:37:07,680
We have to have this hit all of them.

2743
02:37:10,520 --> 02:37:10,920
Come on.

2744
02:37:14,059 --> 02:37:14,940
Oh, almost.

2745
02:37:15,739 --> 02:37:16,620
Just make it.

2746
02:37:16,620 --> 02:37:16,860
Yeah.

2747
02:37:18,620 --> 02:37:19,100
Okay.

2748
02:37:20,219 --> 02:37:20,780
Let's go.

2749
02:37:21,659 --> 02:37:22,540
Look, it made a ladder.

2750
02:37:27,799 --> 02:37:28,440
All right.

2751
02:37:28,440 --> 02:37:29,200
Cool.

2752
02:37:29,200 --> 02:37:31,680
Instead of moving boxes, I can move one other object.

2753
02:37:32,399 --> 02:37:34,799
Uh, I'm about, I'm going to, I'm going to light this up.

2754
02:37:34,799 --> 02:37:35,920
So it's going to move.

2755
02:37:35,920 --> 02:37:36,399
Oh, wait.

2756
02:37:36,399 --> 02:37:36,959
I'm very right.

2757
02:37:36,959 --> 02:37:37,920
That's how that works.

2758
02:37:39,920 --> 02:37:40,479
We did it.

2759
02:37:44,829 --> 02:37:48,489
I, uh, I can freeze it.

2760
02:37:48,489 --> 02:37:49,049
Oh, you got it.

2761
02:37:49,690 --> 02:37:51,770
Doesn't even need our help.

2762
02:37:53,200 --> 02:37:53,920
He's a big boy.

2763
02:37:55,719 --> 02:37:58,680
Guide the two light beams through the yellow crystals on the sides of the cube

2764
02:37:58,680 --> 02:38:01,000
to combine them into a single stronger beam.

2765
02:38:01,879 --> 02:38:03,930
Interesting.

2766
02:38:03,930 --> 02:38:04,170
Thanks.

2767
02:38:04,170 --> 02:38:04,889
Like it boys.

2768
02:38:05,690 --> 02:38:08,600
Oh, it does make a super beam.

2769
02:38:09,239 --> 02:38:12,000
Pardon me.

2770
02:38:12,079 --> 02:38:16,750
Oh, we all fell off.

2771
02:38:16,750 --> 02:38:17,309
It looks like.

2772
02:38:21,520 --> 02:38:34,909
No, perfect time for the demon voice.

2773
02:38:34,909 --> 02:38:36,430
And it didn't do it.

2774
02:38:36,430 --> 02:38:37,069
Yeah, it's true.

2775
02:38:37,709 --> 02:38:38,829
Uh, why are we?

2776
02:38:38,829 --> 02:38:39,329
What?

2777
02:38:40,030 --> 02:38:40,829
We're all wizards.

2778
02:38:42,750 --> 02:38:44,379
I don't even know how to use the wizard.

2779
02:38:44,940 --> 02:38:48,360
Well, you know, he only played through his tutorial twice.

2780
02:38:50,540 --> 02:38:53,440
Oh no.

2781
02:38:55,850 --> 02:38:58,090
A problem that I can't smash the head with.

2782
02:39:00,170 --> 02:39:00,409
All right.

2783
02:39:00,409 --> 02:39:00,889
Hold on.

2784
02:39:00,889 --> 02:39:03,610
There's this, the middle thing can be moved.

2785
02:39:03,610 --> 02:39:04,010
All right.

2786
02:39:04,010 --> 02:39:07,549
Put, put a spinner over here.

2787
02:39:09,559 --> 02:39:11,159
Somebody guide the light.

2788
02:39:14,520 --> 02:39:14,760
Yeah.

2789
02:39:15,319 --> 02:39:15,639
Okay.

2790
02:39:16,360 --> 02:39:20,719
Now, um, what do we do with that thing?

2791
02:39:22,000 --> 02:39:23,200
She's holding onto the edge.

2792
02:39:23,200 --> 02:39:24,399
I can't rotate this one.

2793
02:39:32,840 --> 02:39:39,760
Oh, I mean, it's going in, but what I think we have to do a super beam over there.

2794
02:39:40,559 --> 02:39:43,180
Yeah, I don't.

2795
02:39:44,399 --> 02:39:44,719
Okay.

2796
02:39:48,879 --> 02:39:52,760
Oh, actually just smashing the box.

2797
02:39:52,760 --> 02:39:53,479
You're not helping.

2798
02:39:53,479 --> 02:39:54,760
I'm not involved in this.

2799
02:39:54,760 --> 02:39:55,000
All right.

2800
02:39:55,000 --> 02:39:55,719
What do you get the get?

2801
02:39:55,719 --> 02:39:55,879
Yeah.

2802
02:39:55,879 --> 02:40:00,489
Grab that one and then we have to turn.

2803
02:40:01,370 --> 02:40:02,170
You can rotate that.

2804
02:40:02,170 --> 02:40:02,409
Right?

2805
02:40:02,409 --> 02:40:02,729
Okay.

2806
02:40:06,760 --> 02:40:07,399
Bring it forward.

2807
02:40:08,200 --> 02:40:09,719
Oh, we have to do it to the cold.

2808
02:40:09,719 --> 02:40:09,799
Yeah.

2809
02:40:09,799 --> 02:40:10,600
It's going to go on the college.

2810
02:40:10,600 --> 02:40:12,440
See, like it, it's got to end up shooting up.

2811
02:40:13,479 --> 02:40:18,729
Oh, so then I can just standing here watching us do this.

2812
02:40:20,540 --> 02:40:21,100
They'll get it.

2813
02:40:21,100 --> 02:40:21,739
Any minute now.

2814
02:40:22,379 --> 02:40:24,459
They didn't die on boredom.

2815
02:40:26,079 --> 02:40:27,760
I thought we were aiming at the wall.

2816
02:40:27,760 --> 02:40:29,440
No, don't worry.

2817
02:40:29,440 --> 02:40:31,040
We're going to do this like two or three more times.

2818
02:40:32,000 --> 02:40:33,799
I actually won't.

2819
02:40:34,280 --> 02:40:34,520
What?

2820
02:40:35,079 --> 02:40:36,280
I actually won't have to.

2821
02:40:37,879 --> 02:40:39,399
I feel like more than two people.

2822
02:40:40,040 --> 02:40:41,559
You're just like getting in the way.

2823
02:40:41,559 --> 02:40:44,040
Come stand on the left and go take a shit or something.

2824
02:40:45,079 --> 02:40:46,280
Oh, I do have to take a shit.

2825
02:40:46,280 --> 02:40:46,840
I'll be back.

2826
02:40:47,959 --> 02:40:48,639
Okay.

2827
02:40:48,639 --> 02:40:48,959
Hold on.

2828
02:40:49,760 --> 02:40:53,280
So you just move over to the right and I think I can do it.

2829
02:40:56,780 --> 02:40:58,540
Well, how are you seeing that?

2830
02:40:59,500 --> 02:41:00,379
It's got to go up.

2831
02:41:01,340 --> 02:41:02,219
You got to put yours.

2832
02:41:02,219 --> 02:41:03,260
It's got to be you.

2833
02:41:03,260 --> 02:41:04,139
You got to be shooting it up.

2834
02:41:05,100 --> 02:41:07,870
It's got to go up through the middle portal here.

2835
02:41:09,100 --> 02:41:10,379
That thing's got to go over here.

2836
02:41:11,180 --> 02:41:13,100
How do you rotate?

2837
02:41:14,639 --> 02:41:15,760
Z and X.

2838
02:41:15,760 --> 02:41:16,079
Z.

2839
02:41:16,079 --> 02:41:16,319
Okay.

2840
02:41:16,319 --> 02:41:17,440
Well, I'm using it.

2841
02:41:17,440 --> 02:41:18,079
I'm using it.

2842
02:41:18,079 --> 02:41:18,879
I don't know, dude.

2843
02:41:18,879 --> 02:41:20,399
I'm not using a controller.

2844
02:41:21,920 --> 02:41:27,399
So how would you maybe it has to be down here?

2845
02:41:28,959 --> 02:41:30,239
Well, two beams have to hit it.

2846
02:41:31,229 --> 02:41:32,750
Wait, how do we just have it?

2847
02:41:33,389 --> 02:41:34,030
Get rid of this.

2848
02:41:34,030 --> 02:41:36,590
If we just get rid of this box right here.

2849
02:41:37,389 --> 02:41:38,889
Put this box in the cauldron.

2850
02:41:38,889 --> 02:41:39,290
There you go.

2851
02:41:39,290 --> 02:41:39,690
Right there.

2852
02:41:40,329 --> 02:41:42,250
Nice job.

2853
02:41:53,610 --> 02:41:54,170
Good to work.

2854
02:41:54,889 --> 02:41:57,280
So this is aiming down.

2855
02:41:58,540 --> 02:42:00,860
I actually left a fucking box in here.

2856
02:42:00,860 --> 02:42:01,739
It's just in the way.

2857
02:42:03,500 --> 02:42:04,780
It's just a box here.

2858
02:42:05,500 --> 02:42:05,739
All right.

2859
02:42:05,739 --> 02:42:06,299
What about this?

2860
02:42:06,299 --> 02:42:07,180
Can you do anything with that?

2861
02:42:09,319 --> 02:42:10,590
Can you get like the double?

2862
02:42:11,610 --> 02:42:12,250
Oh, no.

2863
02:42:13,129 --> 02:42:14,120
All right.

2864
02:42:14,120 --> 02:42:15,399
What about if I grab this one?

2865
02:42:15,959 --> 02:42:17,309
Anything happen when I do this?

2866
02:42:18,030 --> 02:42:20,040
All right.

2867
02:42:20,040 --> 02:42:20,280
Hold on.

2868
02:42:20,280 --> 02:42:21,079
What about what about?

2869
02:42:21,079 --> 02:42:21,559
Wait, wait, wait.

2870
02:42:22,360 --> 02:42:23,239
Can you do anything with that?

2871
02:42:24,540 --> 02:42:26,940
Um, maybe check it out.

2872
02:42:26,940 --> 02:42:28,780
Can you angle it with that one?

2873
02:42:28,780 --> 02:42:29,579
I don't think so.

2874
02:42:29,979 --> 02:42:30,780
That's blocking them.

2875
02:42:30,780 --> 02:42:32,940
They know they're around this one.

2876
02:42:32,940 --> 02:42:33,899
You can't do it with this one here.

2877
02:42:33,899 --> 02:42:34,940
Like in the center here.

2878
02:42:35,899 --> 02:42:37,979
I'll hold this right there.

2879
02:42:38,780 --> 02:42:42,520
This fucking box.

2880
02:42:43,559 --> 02:42:44,860
Oh, I'm back.

2881
02:42:44,860 --> 02:42:45,659
What happened?

2882
02:42:45,659 --> 02:42:46,620
Delete your box.

2883
02:42:47,340 --> 02:42:48,219
Oh, shit.

2884
02:42:49,500 --> 02:42:49,819
How?

2885
02:42:50,620 --> 02:42:51,500
We almost got it.

2886
02:42:51,500 --> 02:42:51,899
Hold on.

2887
02:42:53,920 --> 02:42:54,399
Wait, hold on.

2888
02:42:54,399 --> 02:42:55,360
What if I do this?

2889
02:42:55,360 --> 02:42:56,319
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

2890
02:42:56,319 --> 02:42:56,879
Put it back up.

2891
02:42:56,879 --> 02:42:57,360
No, back up.

2892
02:42:57,360 --> 02:42:58,559
Move it.

2893
02:42:58,559 --> 02:42:59,479
All right.

2894
02:42:59,479 --> 02:42:59,879
I'll turn.

2895
02:43:01,559 --> 02:43:01,799
Wait.

2896
02:43:02,520 --> 02:43:03,920
All right.

2897
02:43:03,920 --> 02:43:05,040
I can't get it to aim there.

2898
02:43:06,159 --> 02:43:06,559
Hold on.

2899
02:43:06,559 --> 02:43:09,239
I need if I go like this.

2900
02:43:10,040 --> 02:43:10,440
Hold on.

2901
02:43:11,079 --> 02:43:13,319
I'm either going to have to have the box be here.

2902
02:43:15,739 --> 02:43:16,860
What are we doing?

2903
02:43:16,860 --> 02:43:17,979
What's the point of the middle?

2904
02:43:17,979 --> 02:43:19,420
Oh, that has to be lit.

2905
02:43:20,219 --> 02:43:22,219
Or the cauldron to even open.

2906
02:43:22,219 --> 02:43:23,180
Oh, shit.

2907
02:43:25,260 --> 02:43:26,139
Okay, well, hold on.

2908
02:43:26,139 --> 02:43:27,659
Then this one has to go this way.

2909
02:43:28,700 --> 02:43:29,979
Then this one has to go this way.

2910
02:43:34,670 --> 02:43:36,159
No, shit.

2911
02:43:43,420 --> 02:43:44,139
This one has to go.

2912
02:43:46,079 --> 02:43:46,639
Shit.

2913
02:43:46,639 --> 02:43:47,200
Wait, wait, wait.

2914
02:43:47,200 --> 02:43:47,840
Let go of it.

2915
02:43:47,840 --> 02:43:48,479
Let go of that one.

2916
02:43:48,479 --> 02:43:49,040
Let go of this one.

2917
02:43:49,600 --> 02:43:50,159
Yeah, I think.

2918
02:43:53,290 --> 02:43:54,569
And now you've got to double here,

2919
02:43:55,450 --> 02:43:56,569
but it's got to be angled up.

2920
02:43:58,329 --> 02:43:59,690
Put your box under this, Ash.

2921
02:44:00,649 --> 02:44:00,889
What?

2922
02:44:02,680 --> 02:44:03,000
Hold on.

2923
02:44:03,000 --> 02:44:03,399
Let's see.

2924
02:44:03,399 --> 02:44:04,520
No, that's not going to do anything.

2925
02:44:07,420 --> 02:44:08,059
Wait.

2926
02:44:08,059 --> 02:44:11,549
All right.

2927
02:44:11,549 --> 02:44:12,989
Let me hold that here

2928
02:44:13,709 --> 02:44:15,239
because I don't know what the button is.

2929
02:44:15,959 --> 02:44:18,040
I actually do not know what the button is

2930
02:44:18,040 --> 02:44:19,399
to rotate on control.

2931
02:44:19,399 --> 02:44:20,840
Yeah, but if I put this here, it blocks.

2932
02:44:22,590 --> 02:44:23,469
Still lit up.

2933
02:44:23,469 --> 02:44:24,510
Oh, to the right.

2934
02:44:24,510 --> 02:44:25,950
I can do that, but then I can't aim it.

2935
02:44:25,950 --> 02:44:26,989
Yeah, you can.

2936
02:44:26,989 --> 02:44:27,709
Keep going to the right.

2937
02:44:29,520 --> 02:44:30,719
You can only do that or that.

2938
02:44:30,719 --> 02:44:32,319
Yeah, but how far can you go to the right?

2939
02:44:32,959 --> 02:44:35,819
Can you go up?

2940
02:44:36,219 --> 02:44:38,440
Oh, shit.

2941
02:44:38,440 --> 02:44:39,879
Like, how close can you?

2942
02:44:40,440 --> 02:44:41,479
This isn't going to get it.

2943
02:44:42,440 --> 02:44:42,680
Fuck.

2944
02:44:45,129 --> 02:44:48,139
Um, here, let me try that.

2945
02:44:48,139 --> 02:44:48,940
Let me grab that.

2946
02:44:49,659 --> 02:44:51,659
Oh, wait a minute.

2947
02:44:51,659 --> 02:44:53,020
What if I, what if you put a box under that?

2948
02:44:53,659 --> 02:44:55,360
The box is.

2949
02:44:55,360 --> 02:44:56,239
Well, I wanted to get this

2950
02:44:56,239 --> 02:44:57,520
at a sideways angle to shoot up,

2951
02:44:57,520 --> 02:44:58,319
but I guess you can't do it.

2952
02:44:58,319 --> 02:44:59,120
So no matter what,

2953
02:44:59,120 --> 02:45:01,040
this is going to have to be down here.

2954
02:45:01,040 --> 02:45:01,280
Yeah.

2955
02:45:01,280 --> 02:45:03,120
So then the only thing that works.

2956
02:45:03,120 --> 02:45:04,399
So a box has to be under there.

2957
02:45:05,440 --> 02:45:10,139
Ashley, drop your box.

2958
02:45:10,700 --> 02:45:15,819
Okay.

2959
02:45:15,819 --> 02:45:22,649
Now it's a question of moving this one.

2960
02:45:23,370 --> 02:45:24,639
Hold on.

2961
02:45:24,639 --> 02:45:25,120
Let me see this.

2962
02:45:26,000 --> 02:45:30,299
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

2963
02:45:30,299 --> 02:45:31,639
Because this is just shooting down.

2964
02:45:33,760 --> 02:45:34,000
Yeah.

2965
02:45:34,000 --> 02:45:35,120
And you can't rotate it.

2966
02:45:35,120 --> 02:45:35,360
Yeah.

2967
02:45:35,360 --> 02:45:37,040
Well, it went to move that one back to where it was.

2968
02:45:37,840 --> 02:45:45,200
What if, um, bring it all the way down?

2969
02:45:45,200 --> 02:45:46,780
Does that do?

2970
02:45:46,780 --> 02:45:47,180
It just shoots.

2971
02:45:47,180 --> 02:45:48,379
Oh, that doesn't.

2972
02:45:48,379 --> 02:45:49,819
The poor chat isn't paid.

2973
02:45:53,319 --> 02:45:53,879
Uh, okay.

2974
02:46:06,379 --> 02:46:10,010
Um, yeah.

2975
02:46:10,010 --> 02:46:16,559
But if you do it like that, then I don't this,

2976
02:46:16,559 --> 02:46:18,319
this, which is more patient than you guys.

2977
02:46:20,989 --> 02:46:21,229
Yeah.

2978
02:46:21,229 --> 02:46:23,469
And this, this person's trying to kill us.

2979
02:46:23,469 --> 02:46:24,190
So come on.

2980
02:46:24,829 --> 02:46:28,569
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

2981
02:46:28,569 --> 02:46:28,889
Hold on.

2982
02:46:29,850 --> 02:46:30,489
Shoot into this.

2983
02:46:32,350 --> 02:46:33,389
Can we do something with this?

2984
02:46:33,389 --> 02:46:35,469
Do we, why are we trying to shoot that into?

2985
02:46:37,069 --> 02:46:39,549
Because that one's going to shoot straight down.

2986
02:46:39,549 --> 02:46:40,510
Why don't we angle it?

2987
02:46:40,510 --> 02:46:43,389
And why don't we angle the shot into the fucking bottom one?

2988
02:46:44,030 --> 02:46:46,620
What do you mean?

2989
02:46:46,620 --> 02:46:49,209
I mean, do, why do we, why do we have to like aim it

2990
02:46:49,209 --> 02:46:50,329
and shoot it like at an angle?

2991
02:46:52,590 --> 02:46:53,870
Can you reflect the double beam?

2992
02:46:54,989 --> 02:46:57,149
It's always, these are always right angles.

2993
02:46:57,790 --> 02:46:59,950
Yeah, but you can, we can reflect the,

2994
02:46:59,950 --> 02:47:03,680
the super beam off of one of the mirrors, right?

2995
02:47:05,770 --> 02:47:06,090
Yeah.

2996
02:47:06,809 --> 02:47:08,940
But the mirrors are always right angles.

2997
02:47:08,940 --> 02:47:11,899
So this mirror always has to shoot up to get this thing.

2998
02:47:11,899 --> 02:47:13,180
We can't have like a weird,

2999
02:47:14,379 --> 02:47:16,299
I guess we could have like a half angle.

3000
02:47:16,299 --> 02:47:20,139
If we fucking slightly tilted it on another,

3001
02:47:20,139 --> 02:47:22,219
like there's no way that's the point.

3002
02:47:24,319 --> 02:47:26,000
Just put super beam in the middle.

3003
02:47:26,000 --> 02:47:26,719
Sure for it.

3004
02:47:26,719 --> 02:47:27,600
That's what I'm saying.

3005
02:47:27,600 --> 02:47:29,040
The super beam has to be in the middle.

3006
02:47:35,360 --> 02:47:35,600
Actually.

3007
02:47:35,600 --> 02:47:36,319
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

3008
02:47:36,319 --> 02:47:36,959
Drop everything.

3009
02:47:36,959 --> 02:47:38,639
Jerma drop it all, drop it all.

3010
02:47:40,110 --> 02:47:41,709
The top left one has to change, doesn't it?

3011
02:47:43,680 --> 02:47:44,319
I've got it.

3012
02:47:46,170 --> 02:47:46,809
I've got it.

3013
02:47:52,760 --> 02:47:55,399
See, I didn't think that the super beam could open the cauldron.

3014
02:47:56,120 --> 02:47:56,520
All right.

3015
02:47:56,520 --> 02:47:57,159
Level three.

3016
02:47:58,520 --> 02:47:59,799
That's what my hangup was.

3017
02:48:01,799 --> 02:48:03,319
I don't, I don't fucking know, dude.

3018
02:48:04,200 --> 02:48:04,920
It's tricky.

3019
02:48:06,879 --> 02:48:07,120
Okay.

3020
02:48:07,120 --> 02:48:21,180
So now we have the super beam.

3021
02:48:24,920 --> 02:48:26,280
It's a ball of market now.

3022
02:48:26,280 --> 02:48:27,159
Killer.

3023
02:48:27,159 --> 02:48:27,639
Burner.

3024
02:48:30,909 --> 02:48:32,270
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

3025
02:48:32,270 --> 02:48:33,229
You just got to do that the other way.

3026
02:48:34,030 --> 02:48:35,520
We're just going to flip this whole thing.

3027
02:48:36,319 --> 02:48:37,280
Well, you just mirror.

3028
02:48:38,360 --> 02:48:40,840
No, but we just mirror what we just did and then push this up.

3029
02:48:41,639 --> 02:48:45,629
Well, then that shoots this into the ground.

3030
02:48:46,190 --> 02:48:47,469
That's not mirror.

3031
02:48:47,469 --> 02:48:48,270
Sure for what do we do?

3032
02:48:58,479 --> 02:48:58,719
Okay.

3033
02:48:58,719 --> 02:49:00,399
Wait, wait, drop the thing you're moving around.

3034
02:49:00,399 --> 02:49:03,200
That has to shoot your, it has to go down down.

3035
02:49:03,200 --> 02:49:04,799
It has to go up ahead.

3036
02:49:04,799 --> 02:49:05,200
Okay.

3037
02:49:05,200 --> 02:49:06,799
So then move.

3038
02:49:07,760 --> 02:49:08,959
Now that's, wait, wait, wait, wait, hold on.

3039
02:49:10,000 --> 02:49:17,129
Now you should be able to angle it.

3040
02:49:17,129 --> 02:49:18,090
If it, if you go.

3041
02:49:19,290 --> 02:49:21,690
Oh, there's two things that I think will be lit up.

3042
02:49:21,690 --> 02:49:25,530
So if you, what do you move this one down a little?

3043
02:49:27,579 --> 02:49:33,739
Like, can we, that one's not doing much.

3044
02:49:33,739 --> 02:49:34,299
This one has to be.

3045
02:49:35,100 --> 02:49:37,600
All right.

3046
02:49:37,600 --> 02:49:38,319
Let me see.

3047
02:49:38,319 --> 02:49:39,760
You know, sure for is on it.

3048
02:49:39,760 --> 02:49:40,000
All right.

3049
02:49:40,000 --> 02:49:40,879
Sure for what do you think?

3050
02:49:41,520 --> 02:49:42,239
Left down.

3051
02:49:43,120 --> 02:49:46,879
That's what I was just thinking, but I don't, you have to flip it twice.

3052
02:49:51,040 --> 02:49:51,280
Why?

3053
02:49:51,280 --> 02:49:52,479
What happened to the German stock?

3054
02:49:52,479 --> 02:49:54,000
When did he get a bunch of minus twos?

3055
02:49:55,280 --> 02:49:58,399
Because, because us not being able to figure out a puzzle is,

3056
02:49:58,399 --> 02:49:59,840
is a bad joke, apparently.

3057
02:50:01,290 --> 02:50:01,690
I guess.

3058
02:50:02,729 --> 02:50:05,370
Imagine being so jaded at like everything you watch.

3059
02:50:08,170 --> 02:50:11,790
Trying to see if I can get this at a sideways angle.

3060
02:50:12,670 --> 02:50:15,719
Move right down.

3061
02:50:17,879 --> 02:50:19,319
We can do more than one box.

3062
02:50:21,979 --> 02:50:23,260
Left down and hit the yellow.

3063
02:50:25,979 --> 02:50:27,020
Then move right down.

3064
02:50:27,739 --> 02:50:32,059
Then what we do, what do we do with this?

3065
02:50:34,360 --> 02:50:36,680
Cause it has to go all the way up to the top left.

3066
02:50:36,680 --> 02:50:38,120
It's gotta like shoot into the top left.

3067
02:50:38,840 --> 02:50:43,020
Here, here, here, here.

3068
02:50:43,020 --> 02:50:43,739
I got it.

3069
02:50:43,739 --> 02:50:48,959
I got it.

3070
02:50:48,959 --> 02:50:49,200
Yeah.

3071
02:50:49,200 --> 02:50:52,319
But now that has to be this has to be mirrored the other way.

3072
02:50:52,319 --> 02:50:52,719
Hold on.

3073
02:50:52,719 --> 02:50:53,520
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

3074
02:50:53,520 --> 02:50:55,200
No, no, no, no, no, no, don't, don't wait, wait, wait.

3075
02:50:55,200 --> 02:50:55,680
Nobody move.

3076
02:50:56,649 --> 02:50:57,930
Do exactly what you just did.

3077
02:50:57,930 --> 02:50:58,889
There's one on the ground right here.

3078
02:50:59,899 --> 02:51:00,620
Hold on.

3079
02:51:00,620 --> 02:51:01,180
Get rid of this.

3080
02:51:01,899 --> 02:51:03,100
How do I get rid of this fucking thing?

3081
02:51:03,819 --> 02:51:14,440
Okay, do exactly what you just did got it

3082
02:51:26,389 --> 02:51:32,700
Finally you actually did it minus two you fucking guys are so bad at this game like I'm missing dinner. No

3083
02:51:46,770 --> 02:51:54,440
Even though which is talking shit. Well, she's a witch. Isn't that kind of what they do? That's her job

3084
02:52:06,750 --> 02:52:10,010
The cat

3085
02:52:33,930 --> 02:52:38,780
What was the whole thing with the likes wimmy's

3086
02:52:39,659 --> 02:52:45,379
Back then you see like on his shoulders like the big swimmies the big like inflated pads

3087
02:52:49,340 --> 02:52:52,139
Is that like a there's like a status symbol or something

3088
02:52:53,659 --> 02:52:59,860
Yeah, like in blizzard like the better you are at blizzard world of warcraft the bigger shoulders are oh

3089
02:53:00,459 --> 02:53:02,979
My god, he looks really weird without a helmet

3090
02:53:12,229 --> 02:53:16,850
I think I have to go. I'm just double-checking that

3091
02:53:18,370 --> 02:53:20,209
Where you going?

3092
02:53:20,209 --> 02:53:22,649
D&D, I think it's it's time. Oh

3093
02:53:23,610 --> 02:53:29,090
You're gonna go. Yeah, I'm right sure for he knows he's there. He's one of the boys right? Oh

3094
02:53:30,440 --> 02:53:33,719
No stars got to get out of here star and Ashley gotta go

3095
02:53:35,479 --> 02:53:40,520
All right, let me uh, this is important though before you leave do you want to play this again? I do

3096
02:53:41,840 --> 02:53:44,280
You want to finish this game? Okay. Yeah. Yeah. All right

3097
02:53:47,159 --> 02:53:49,159
Weekend trying

3098
02:53:49,520 --> 02:53:51,520
Tuesday trying trying whatever it is

3099
02:53:52,040 --> 02:53:59,100
One day I'll unlock my second ability conjured a ball and then I'll finally unlock two objects

3100
02:54:01,219 --> 02:54:08,159
Trying Tuesday's all right. Well, I just really sincerely hope it'll let us pick up from where we stopped

3101
02:54:08,600 --> 02:54:11,440
Well, I keep saying saving in the top right

3102
02:54:11,440 --> 02:54:13,799
I'm assuming that means it's saving the game

3103
02:54:14,479 --> 02:54:17,719
Right. It's all up to Steve. So it's all

3104
02:54:18,079 --> 02:54:24,000
I've got all I can select level from this screen. I'm gonna assume everything is great. It says saving

3105
02:54:24,000 --> 02:54:26,000
I'm going to continue quitting to desktop

3106
02:54:26,719 --> 02:54:28,719
Okay, and then I'm going to

3107
02:54:30,399 --> 02:54:35,479
You know, Merry Christmas on German, I'm gonna wish you a Merry Christmas have fun at your at your sesh

3108
02:54:36,040 --> 02:54:41,319
I'm gonna have a Dean Dungeons and Dragons sesh. Cool. I you know, I gotta go

3109
02:54:41,319 --> 02:54:46,760
But German is gonna play some old Atari game. You never heard of I think and you're gonna be like, wow

3110
02:54:46,760 --> 02:54:48,760
This is he's such a boomer

3111
02:54:49,040 --> 02:54:51,579
It'll be great

3112
02:54:51,579 --> 02:54:55,459
Now that actually sounds like a pretty good idea. They got an Atari like 2600 scream

3113
02:54:56,020 --> 02:55:01,139
Like play the one of the oldest existing football games that were like on the Nintendos

3114
02:55:01,459 --> 02:55:09,059
That's that was pretty cool a for all buttons for all actions, but it's hot hot a hike a a a pass a

3115
02:55:09,700 --> 02:55:11,700
run to goal a

3116
02:55:12,620 --> 02:55:17,700
I'll dig ET out of a landfill somewhere and play that too. I guess. Okay. Yeah, maybe

3117
02:55:18,219 --> 02:55:24,340
But hey, see ya see you next Sunday for trying Sundays. Yeah. See ya. All right. See ya. See you later guys

3118
02:55:24,860 --> 02:55:29,790
that was us that was star and Ashley both very fun cool people and

3119
02:55:31,700 --> 02:55:33,100
I

3120
02:55:33,100 --> 02:55:36,709
I'm gonna give you an unfortunate circumstance here

3121
02:55:37,309 --> 02:55:43,959
I'm gonna I have to leave I'm gonna go to I'm starting to feel a little

3122
02:55:44,920 --> 02:55:46,840
Strange downstairs

3123
02:55:46,840 --> 02:55:55,840
So I I have to go. I will be live tomorrow. This is actually into the stream. I do have to leave

3124
02:55:56,760 --> 02:56:05,200
So I'm sorry, but it's okay because like I said, we'll there's gonna be less time on stream

3125
02:56:05,200 --> 02:56:07,200
But there can be more days. So I'll be live tomorrow

3126
02:56:07,920 --> 02:56:12,219
I'll be live tomorrow at the same time. So we're on like one or two tomorrow

3127
02:56:12,760 --> 02:56:21,280
I'm going to start the thing. We took a nice little break from horror shit

3128
02:56:21,360 --> 02:56:35,510
So tomorrow we're gonna go to the thing should be interesting same time. He hates screaming

3129
02:56:35,510 --> 02:56:43,600
I still think that's funny. But yeah, well trying it's fun. It's fun. Just to just play a game sometimes

3130
02:56:44,239 --> 02:56:52,569
Brings me back, you know when the three of us played games, so you'll see trying to get next weekend

3131
02:56:52,569 --> 02:56:54,850
We'll just I'm sure we'll probably get somewhere close to the end

3132
02:56:54,850 --> 02:57:00,760
What is it like a today 10-hour game something like that? I think that sounds like plan to me

3133
02:57:00,799 --> 02:57:05,440
But I'm not gonna leave just yet. I am going to just be right back for a minute

3134
02:57:05,479 --> 02:57:12,360
I'm going to get some water and I'll come back and we'll do the bits and then I'll see you guys tomorrow

3135
02:57:12,360 --> 02:57:16,270
I'll see you guys really soon. Be right back

3136
02:59:11,840 --> 02:59:14,170
Sound

3137
02:59:14,170 --> 02:59:16,350
Yeah, I'm here

3138
02:59:17,190 --> 02:59:20,510
Thankfully, I've been on this medicine for like a week and

3139
02:59:21,670 --> 02:59:23,229
after like

3140
02:59:23,229 --> 02:59:26,750
Eight to ten days. I don't think I'm gonna have to be taking it anymore

3141
02:59:27,469 --> 02:59:29,690
so

3142
02:59:29,690 --> 02:59:35,549
We'll go back to normal and probably like another four or five days. I would assume

3143
02:59:35,989 --> 02:59:42,760
We'll see. I don't know. Maybe I'll talk to my doctor and he might be maybe he says no you stay on it

3144
02:59:42,760 --> 02:59:46,090
I don't know but

3145
02:59:46,290 --> 02:59:52,500
See you guys tomorrow. We'll play the thing. I still have to do Parappa the Rapper and Parappa the Rapper 2 and

3146
02:59:54,399 --> 03:00:01,159
Talking about PlayStation 1 stuff. I have

3147
03:00:01,680 --> 03:00:10,959
Bushido blade and Bushido blade 2 so that should be a lot of fun those

3148
03:00:10,959 --> 03:00:30,459
I remember those games being a lot of fun. Those games are awesome. Dermacycle still not there. Not yet

3149
03:00:31,020 --> 03:00:35,329
When's Rhythm Heaven when I get a DS

3150
03:00:36,770 --> 03:00:47,290
That I can mess with or I'll find another way but let's go back to earlier we had sticks Renegade 250

3151
03:00:47,629 --> 03:00:51,030
When is Dead Rising?

3152
03:00:51,030 --> 03:00:53,270
After that, we've got the thing

3153
03:00:54,110 --> 03:01:00,219
However, I might not even beat the thing. I don't know if it depends on how it plays out

3154
03:01:00,860 --> 03:01:08,200
But the thing I've got Siren for PS2. We've got both the Parappa games

3155
03:01:09,420 --> 03:01:11,420
and Bushido blade and Bushido blade 2

3156
03:01:11,420 --> 03:01:12,540
after that

3157
03:01:12,540 --> 03:01:24,159
Then you're looking at probably Dead Rising and then after that we'll see I mean the Halloween stream is gonna happen somewhere in there, too

3158
03:01:24,559 --> 03:01:34,079
But sticks Renegade. Thanks in 250 any chance you play crash team racing one day nitro fueled

3159
03:01:34,079 --> 03:01:39,809
I know you like driving and games. I saw Vinny played and it was hilarious seeing him rage at the game

3160
03:01:39,969 --> 03:01:47,180
It's way better than Mario Kart. I have never played any of the games besides Sonic racing

3161
03:01:47,299 --> 03:01:51,559
I've never played any other racing game. That was not Mario Kart

3162
03:01:52,319 --> 03:02:01,360
Let me a cartoon racing game and everyone's played cruise in USA. I mean everyone has well Garfield cart was a joke

3163
03:02:01,360 --> 03:02:06,809
I played that for like 32 seconds Simpsons hit and run. That's not a racing game

3164
03:02:06,930 --> 03:02:22,360
That's like a GTA game. Every mission is a racing. Yeah, but it's not like a 3 2 1

3165
03:02:22,840 --> 03:02:27,340
Race the 12 people with you. It's not like a cartoon

3166
03:02:28,059 --> 03:02:34,629
Racing game where you race on tracks. It's that's that's like a Grand Theft Auto clone

3167
03:02:34,629 --> 03:02:37,750
I mean you can race in Grand Theft Auto

3168
03:02:38,110 --> 03:02:47,319
But Grand Theft Auto is not a like a cartoon racing game and you can do them there was a count

3169
03:02:47,319 --> 03:02:53,459
All right, but you guys know what I'm talking about. You know what I'm saying

3170
03:02:53,459 --> 03:03:05,899
I do good at least one person does two people do cart game. There you go. Thank you

3171
03:03:05,899 --> 03:03:15,299
But I don't know maybe time GTA game

3172
03:03:15,340 --> 03:03:21,430
Maybe one day if there's something to do nothing else to do or whatever if I don't have any plans or anything

3173
03:03:21,469 --> 03:03:25,579
But thank you sticks renegade. Thank you Elizabeth for the 250

3174
03:03:25,659 --> 03:03:29,459
So after having I'm jammer Lammy soundtrack on my mind since yesterday

3175
03:03:29,459 --> 03:03:35,620
I stumbled across that in stage six of the worst song in the concert hall with the weird green alien

3176
03:03:35,620 --> 03:03:42,180
It was actually changed for the US version of the game where in the US version your belt gets stuck on the door and you go

3177
03:03:42,180 --> 03:03:48,129
Back in time. However in the Japanese version you get hit by a car you die and go to hell

3178
03:03:48,209 --> 03:03:51,610
Yeah, I remember we were talking about that yesterday

3179
03:03:51,889 --> 03:04:06,889
Why is that such a I don't know why that's such a big deal for the US sensors that why that's weird of all the things

3180
03:04:06,889 --> 03:04:11,170
Like there's somebody like fucked up violent crazy games over here

3181
03:04:11,170 --> 03:04:26,250
That's the one that you know, you have to censor they wanted the US version to appeal to more younger kids

3182
03:04:26,250 --> 03:04:37,280
I guess yeah, but I don't know if I don't they like go to hell in a Teen Titans episode

3183
03:04:37,440 --> 03:04:43,840
Yeah, that pregnancy level really appealed to the kids

3184
03:04:45,700 --> 03:04:52,200
Right like what? Why is that the that's fucked? That's true. Yeah, that's fucked up

3185
03:04:52,479 --> 03:05:02,280
There's a Disneyland ride that ends with you going to hell

3186
03:05:02,920 --> 03:05:09,750
Almost every cartoon from the last hundred years as an episode with the devil or something. Yeah

3187
03:05:10,809 --> 03:05:17,329
Whatever, but yeah, thank you Elizabeth. Thank you. Toast fart for the 500 bits

3188
03:05:18,049 --> 03:05:27,829
Thank you, sir. Canine for the 300 bits. Jerma. I saw this in a recommended

3189
03:05:28,350 --> 03:05:31,870
So this isn't recommended on YouTube on one of your vids and I thought you'd find it funny

3190
03:05:32,350 --> 03:05:46,120
Let's find out what do you mean you found this isn't recommended you got a tenth of a second

3191
03:05:46,600 --> 03:05:52,299
This is a different YouTube link than the one from last night. Don't start this shit

3192
03:05:54,379 --> 03:05:57,290
Thank you rec records

3193
03:05:58,090 --> 03:06:03,100
Recor SED for the 250. Hey German inspired by the carnival stream. I went out and got this done

3194
03:06:03,860 --> 03:06:08,969
Thanks, Jeremy. Wait, you got a tat. This is tattoo

3195
03:06:09,610 --> 03:06:14,629
Are you serious? Hold on a second

3196
03:06:14,709 --> 03:06:19,430
Hold on a second. Wow

3197
03:06:20,190 --> 03:06:25,930
Why that the um, it's a little confused though

3198
03:06:26,770 --> 03:06:35,780
Because why did you get a you got a tattoo of me? That's weird. I mean like that's that's a tattoo of me

3199
03:06:35,780 --> 03:06:47,370
I mean, it's cool. I'm yeah, I'm showing it right now. I don't know why you got a tattoo of my face

3200
03:06:47,930 --> 03:07:05,809
That's actually a really like cool tattoo

3201
03:07:14,170 --> 03:07:16,170
EU date

3202
03:07:16,889 --> 03:07:22,649
That's great that's

3203
03:07:22,649 --> 03:07:24,649
That's I love it

3204
03:07:24,729 --> 03:07:31,659
That you know what? I love I love tattoos that are really just simple and like basic

3205
03:07:32,379 --> 03:07:33,500
tattoos

3206
03:07:33,500 --> 03:07:41,219
Because that you know, it's like it's like a small little piece, right? You know, I mean, I like the small tattoos the little ones

3207
03:07:41,700 --> 03:07:47,450
That just like you know, hey, look at that. I got that. Oh, wow, that's cool. Look at that

3208
03:07:47,809 --> 03:07:54,979
So it is a tattoo of you. I kind of walked into that one didn't I but it's alright

3209
03:07:55,620 --> 03:07:57,620
That's an awesome tattoo rec

3210
03:07:57,780 --> 03:08:07,280
Thank you for sharing it with everybody here and thank you for the 250 appreciate it cool tattoo

3211
03:08:07,680 --> 03:08:12,319
Thank you generate blue for the 300 bits. Hey, Jeremy

3212
03:08:12,559 --> 03:08:17,959
Just wanted to give you some bits for the quality entertainment you provide. Thank you the streams and thanks specifically

3213
03:08:18,520 --> 03:08:23,280
Especially for pulling back the starting time as it's severely easier to catch your streams now

3214
03:08:23,280 --> 03:08:25,920
Even if I got to go to work early the next day

3215
03:08:26,520 --> 03:08:28,520
Thank you for the 300 bits

3216
03:08:29,280 --> 03:08:34,379
Appreciate the kind message and yes, the reason why I pulled it back is because even I

3217
03:08:35,139 --> 03:08:38,940
started to see that as the streams obviously not this one, but

3218
03:08:39,819 --> 03:08:44,739
The average stream time has increased over the last couple years and moving to Pacific time

3219
03:08:45,500 --> 03:08:50,340
When a stream is six seven plus hours on average, it's

3220
03:08:51,180 --> 03:08:56,579
It gets so late for everybody else that I just I don't want people to have to stay up to like three or four o'clock

3221
03:08:56,579 --> 03:08:58,260
in the morning every time

3222
03:08:58,299 --> 03:09:00,270
so

3223
03:09:00,270 --> 03:09:12,180
They're like 1 to 2 p.m. Start. I think is a perfect time. I don't think I'm going to change the time of the stream

3224
03:09:12,700 --> 03:09:17,489
again

3225
03:09:17,489 --> 03:09:24,370
EST is crying. What do you mean? Yes, two three five o'clock six o'clock Eastern start and

3226
03:09:26,170 --> 03:09:28,170
That's like prime time in it

3227
03:09:28,250 --> 03:09:41,920
That's like, you know six seven p.m. We really get going. I used to start my streams at seven Eastern

3228
03:09:42,200 --> 03:09:50,010
Which was about four o'clock Pacific and then when I came over here it's a Vegas

3229
03:09:50,530 --> 03:09:57,799
It was I obviously was not gonna start seven Pacific because I would just be too late. I think for everybody

3230
03:10:01,180 --> 03:10:09,049
But yeah, I like it too. I think it's doing well and it'll stay but thank you generate blue

3231
03:10:09,610 --> 03:10:11,829
Thanks for watching the stream

3232
03:10:11,829 --> 03:10:17,489
Vilemi, thanks for the thousand bits ten dollars ending the stream because he's stinky

3233
03:10:18,010 --> 03:10:27,950
Thank you for the thousand bits appreciate it Freudian weapon. Thanks for the 500 bits. No message. Just 500 bits. Thank you

3234
03:10:28,389 --> 03:10:36,299
Let's get the credits on this little short stream. I actually can move from here

3235
03:10:37,020 --> 03:10:44,040
Here is there camera on no, I just dumped this is what this is the camera section

3236
03:10:44,520 --> 03:10:55,219
Thanks, everyone summoned for something. Thanks everybody for summoning me from health appreciate it

3237
03:10:56,459 --> 03:11:06,329
Thanks for supporting this tree. I'm seriously and thank you for writing with it again for the 500

3238
03:11:07,370 --> 03:11:15,190
See VFD. Thanks for the thousand bits. Great stream as always German. Thank you. Yeah

3239
03:11:15,829 --> 03:11:21,250
It's it was a fun one. It was just it was it was a just hanging out with my friends

3240
03:11:24,989 --> 03:11:30,270
Sometimes I have some of the most fun when I'm just chilling playing a game just talking about random stuff

3241
03:11:30,709 --> 03:11:34,809
I've been having a lot of fun on stream

3242
03:11:35,250 --> 03:11:38,829
Not that I wasn't having it before but I've been having like a ton of fun

3243
03:11:39,469 --> 03:11:49,180
The last like six months and like I said, it's not not even like oh, I wasn't you know, seven months ago

3244
03:11:49,180 --> 03:11:51,180
Wow, I really was I hate streaming

3245
03:11:51,659 --> 03:11:55,840
No, I think there's just been a lot of fun things going on recently

3246
03:11:56,600 --> 03:12:01,549
You ever get burnt out

3247
03:12:01,549 --> 03:12:06,360
Nope, because I take a lot of time off. That's by design

3248
03:12:06,360 --> 03:12:16,670
I take at least two days off a week at least two three days off a week to make sure that that doesn't happen

3249
03:12:16,829 --> 03:12:28,120
I mean for the most part do you this stream is live four times a week three or four times a week sometimes I

3250
03:12:28,639 --> 03:12:44,450
think it's important to take all time off not just to take care of stuff in your life, but

3251
03:12:44,969 --> 03:12:47,610
It lets you

3252
03:12:47,610 --> 03:12:57,370
Unplug a little and I can continue to have fun on this stream and go back and forth with you guys and have a good time

3253
03:12:58,489 --> 03:12:59,729
because

3254
03:12:59,729 --> 03:13:03,520
It's I have time to be away from it, too

3255
03:13:04,079 --> 03:13:15,459
You did how does it feel to die to third wheel?

3256
03:13:16,180 --> 03:13:33,959
So I I appreciate streaming more because I do it less and that's the way it's gonna be and that's the way it always

3257
03:13:33,959 --> 03:13:42,520
Will be but yeah, it's kind of the way it is

3258
03:13:43,520 --> 03:13:47,620
does hate it

3259
03:13:47,620 --> 03:13:53,329
No, I don't but thank you

3260
03:13:54,659 --> 03:13:55,860
for

3261
03:13:55,860 --> 03:14:02,479
Kind message. Well, actually that was Vilemi was the last message they said ending stream because he's stinky

3262
03:14:03,200 --> 03:14:09,319
No, see oh see VFD right great stream as always. Yep. Thank you

3263
03:14:12,170 --> 03:14:18,329

3264
03:14:19,010 --> 03:14:25,090

3265
03:14:37,440 --> 03:14:44,190
Yeah, no it is fun you'll see it again, but we'll complete it if it takes another stream or two

3266
03:14:44,709 --> 03:14:54,250
We will do the three Triners again, you'll see it. Thank you gnarly. Appreciate it Vilemi

3267
03:14:54,250 --> 03:14:57,930
Thanks for the thousand bits Jerma lied about Jerma psycho. I never promised Jerma psycho

3268
03:14:57,930 --> 03:15:02,010
I said it would be there maybe eventually but I wasn't gonna give a time frame on it

3269
03:15:02,530 --> 03:15:04,760
I'm looking for the right image

3270
03:15:04,760 --> 03:15:09,840
Yeah, I said it's gonna be here, but I didn't say it'll be here tomorrow

3271
03:15:10,520 --> 03:15:30,370
Figs nice. That's all that's actually awesome. I can't wait to eat a fig or a fig spread maybe

3272
03:15:30,370 --> 03:15:32,739
I have to be careful though

3273
03:15:32,899 --> 03:15:41,579
Well, I'm done that home. I'm fine fig Newton's are the best cookies

3274
03:15:41,579 --> 03:15:49,219
I you know what here's the crazy thing fig Newton's are the best cookies that you never buy. I don't know

3275
03:15:49,219 --> 03:15:55,420
I what what what's what's with that? Why don't you just get them? I love fig Newton's, but I don't think I've ever purchased them

3276
03:15:55,639 --> 03:16:04,010
Don't ask me why you always get like the shitty cookies that you know that you're not gonna eat very many of but I would eat

3277
03:16:04,010 --> 03:16:10,409
The whole box of fig newtons then all right the next time I go to the grocery store

3278
03:16:10,729 --> 03:16:12,729
I'm going to buy fig Newton's

3279
03:16:13,170 --> 03:16:15,540
Or I'll do a 24-hour stream

3280
03:16:15,979 --> 03:16:32,280
How about that one and I'll eat one on stream just so you can know you can prove it, but thank you for let me for the

3281
03:16:33,280 --> 03:16:41,299
Thousand bits. Thank you. Tay for the 250. Hey German love tonight stream. Thanks for being here. Thanks for hanging out

3282
03:16:41,659 --> 03:16:48,540
Thanks to the 250 as well. Keith King. Thanks for the 250. Are you still planning on playing more Katamari games?

3283
03:16:48,979 --> 03:16:53,780
We love Katamari for the ps2 is my favorite game and I'd love to see my favorite streamer play it

3284
03:16:54,459 --> 03:16:57,059
Yes, I

3285
03:16:57,059 --> 03:16:59,899
At some point I'm gonna try to do

3286
03:17:00,500 --> 03:17:04,860
At least a couple more of the Katamari games because those streams are a lot of fun

3287
03:17:04,860 --> 03:17:10,170
I did the first one all in one stream, right? I think that's the only one I played

3288
03:17:10,829 --> 03:17:15,340
but that's another game that's fun just to play and just

3289
03:17:16,020 --> 03:17:23,799
Chill and hang out and just talk about random shit. So you'll see it again. I'll do more of the series

3290
03:17:24,280 --> 03:17:26,959
Because those games are really fun

3291
03:17:26,959 --> 03:17:34,030
Just not right now probably not till somewhere in like November or something because all of October is I've got a

3292
03:17:34,590 --> 03:17:36,590
Bunch of stuff that's just lined up ready to go

3293
03:17:37,110 --> 03:17:46,850
Hey, it's Shanji. Thanks for the thousand bits to end it out here. They say ADHD family represent

3294
03:17:47,129 --> 03:17:55,319
Yeah, I mean I got it. I do have it. Yeah, and

3295
03:17:56,420 --> 03:17:58,540
It's it can be

3296
03:17:58,540 --> 03:18:03,139
It can be a kind of hard to dance around

3297
03:18:03,780 --> 03:18:11,270
But you know, whatever do what you gotta do, thank you so much for the thousand bits appreciate it and

3298
03:18:14,920 --> 03:18:19,719
You know what that means. We've reached the end to our short trying stream

3299
03:18:20,319 --> 03:18:23,399
I'm going to go and take care of myself a little bit

3300
03:18:24,200 --> 03:18:32,930
Maybe eat a fig and go do some stuff. I'll see you tomorrow same time

3301
03:18:33,489 --> 03:18:48,450
Season the thing begins tomorrow. Have a great rest of your night or afternoon. It's still pretty early

3302
03:18:48,450 --> 03:19:05,840
See you later. Good night guys. Somebody's upset about something. Good night
