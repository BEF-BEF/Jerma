1
00:00:04,089 --> 00:00:11,980
How are we doing? Good afternoon. How are we doing? Good, good, good, good, good.

2
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:23,539
You are currently joining me and us for a Black Ops 2 tournament. It's being hosted by Myth.

3
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:33,369
I'm very, very scared. I don't... I played Call of Duty a little bit. I was a kind of a Call of Duty

4
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:39,500
player for... I want to say just to desperately make YouTube videos.

5
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:47,259
It's like, oh, I know. I'll just play like Black Ops 2 or something. And I made some terrible

6
00:00:47,259 --> 00:00:55,320
fucking videos. I played for about an hour. This is the perspective that you want to watch if you

7
00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:03,030
want to make fun of the streamer. If you want to ask like, oh dude, what the fuck is this guy doing

8
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:09,109
here? You know what I mean? I'll be the pin cushion today, right? If you want to come talk

9
00:01:09,109 --> 00:01:18,780
shit to somebody today, just stay here. If I go 0 and 30, I'll get at least like a dozen kills,

10
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:27,430
okay? I can promise you that. I will accept... I will be the vacuum for all the negativity today.

11
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:34,939
It's going to be really fun. I'm actually excited. But I actually might surprise you. We'll see.

12
00:01:37,659 --> 00:01:49,530
I might surprise you today. We'll find out. Currently just running around in the... We're

13
00:01:49,530 --> 00:02:01,560
doing a free for all. Get the ear wig ready. Dude, I don't even know what guns to use.

14
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:07,829
In chat like 20 minutes ago, I was like, what's a good weapon to use? I don't know.

15
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:14,710
I genuinely have no fucking idea. I just have a rapid fire extended mags sub machine gun.

16
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:19,509
That's it. I'm just going to hold the button down. I'm going to play Pyro.

17
00:02:20,069 --> 00:02:28,259
Can you guys hear the game? Let me see how we're doing here.

18
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:35,379
They just stuck with it. They would have gotten the big one and all even out.

19
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:49,419
We're still kind of preparing. Don't worry. I will show. I just got a kill. I actually just

20
00:02:49,419 --> 00:03:04,469
got a kill. You just didn't see it. Should I even use grenades? All right. I'm good to go.

21
00:03:04,469 --> 00:03:11,909
What's up, everybody? I'm just hoping to get one kill this whole entire event.

22
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:14,009
They're just updating it real quick.

23
00:03:16,009 --> 00:03:22,569
Just want to make sure I was not behind. That was not me.

24
00:03:27,909 --> 00:03:35,860
You just hear like... Are we playing zombies? No, actually, I don't know the format.

25
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:46,599
I think we met team. Team deathmatch. Domination, probably. Yeah, we're still preparing.

26
00:03:55,099 --> 00:04:00,090
You have to play zombies. Wait, wait, wait. Do we have some advice here?

27
00:04:00,729 --> 00:04:06,979
From experience, cigarette smokers perform 20%... I'm not going to read the rest of that.

28
00:04:06,979 --> 00:04:12,379
Thank you for the comment, though. The game's too violent. I don't know if I can watch.

29
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:19,689
I think we're going to get started. I have... I don't know what to say.

30
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:28,949
This is going to be fucked up. Did they ban rivers of blood? Oh, yeah, it's banned.

31
00:04:29,509 --> 00:04:38,569
We're missing a teammate? I'm pretty sure a couple people had to drop just because of the

32
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:48,379
change to this week. So we have a couple of new teammates, I think, from my understanding.

33
00:04:48,379 --> 00:04:50,540
But we'll get started shortly. Somebody just dove out of the window.

34
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:56,230
I would be showing this, but I think we're going to restart the server, so... Oh, yeah.

35
00:04:58,259 --> 00:05:06,360
All right, you know what? Do a prediction. How about this? Will I place at one point in the top

36
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:16,740
two of... No, top three of my team. Will I place in the top three point-wise on the team at any

37
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:31,639
point during the entire night? No, sorry, King. Who is he talking to? You! I'm talking to you!

38
00:05:32,439 --> 00:05:54,870
So should we go to our team channels now? I think... Who's on team two?

39
00:05:58,629 --> 00:06:06,500
I don't know. If you're on team two, let's hop down to team two.

40
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,560
Which is team two. Yes, chef.

41
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:20,009
Yes, chef. Event info.

42
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:28,060
All right, I'm in the team two lobby. All right, here. Let's start streaming, huh? What do you say?

43
00:06:32,019 --> 00:06:41,879
Okay. Jerma. Hey! This is our first time playing together, I think. I know. Well,

44
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:47,480
wait. No, we did the battleship tournament. Oh, yeah. I totally forgot about that.

45
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:53,319
You absolutely destroyed me in one of our games. It was actually pretty close.

46
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:57,459
Pretty close, actually. How much of a Call of Duty guy are you?

47
00:06:57,459 --> 00:07:05,540
I played when I was 13. Yeah. And that's about it. I'm kind of sad I couldn't get my

48
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:10,839
controller to work with plutonium, but... Oh, you were going controller.

49
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:16,279
Well, okay, this is kind of a weird thing to say, but if you use controller in this game,

50
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:17,879
you get aim assist. You do?

51
00:07:18,779 --> 00:07:27,370
Yes. So like, your crosshair will just lock on to them. If you're like slightly off, it just locks on.

52
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:30,089
That seems amazing. I should plug it in. Does it work?

53
00:07:30,089 --> 00:07:34,410
Yeah. If you can get it to work, it's definitely a lot better.

54
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:40,819
I first was standing still and I couldn't even kill him. I'm so bad at this game.

55
00:07:40,819 --> 00:07:50,009
I can get it to like do everything, but walk around. What? Xbox controller?

56
00:07:50,009 --> 00:07:52,329
I love the Switch controller. It's kind of weird, but...

57
00:07:52,329 --> 00:07:58,519
Wait, you say Switch controller? Yeah. Yeah. I like the Switch Pro controller.

58
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:02,920
Oh, okay. I don't know why I was thinking about the... I thought you had Joy-Cons in your hand.

59
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:06,360
I don't know why for some reason. Oh, not that. I mean, the Switch Pro controller.

60
00:08:07,379 --> 00:08:11,459
It's pretty much an Xbox controller, but slightly smaller.

61
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:16,550
Yeah. That's like the best controller that you mentioned it.

62
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:18,040
Yeah. I think I have one somewhere.

63
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:23,560
Yeah. It depends on hand size, but for me, it's like, I like the Xbox controller,

64
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:29,180
but that one fits my hand a little bit. So it's kind of...

65
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:36,519
Yeah. PlayStation 5 and 4? My thumbs bump into each other all the time.

66
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:39,960
Oh, God. Yeah. That's me with the PlayStation. Yeah.

67
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,039
Yeah. Not my favorite.

68
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:48,519
Not bad, but... Oh, you just got me. You got me right in the head.

69
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:49,879
It was in the head? Yeah. Amazing.

70
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,639
Okay. So, wait, have you played Call of Duty before?

71
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:57,190
That was pretty good. That was pretty good. Yeah. Just a little bit.

72
00:08:57,190 --> 00:09:05,059
There's a cheese build in Call of Duty that used to be all the rage for highlight reels

73
00:09:05,059 --> 00:09:11,340
called quickscoping, where you just get a sniper and you run around and try and snipe them really,

74
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:15,539
really fast. So you're a quickscoper?

75
00:09:15,539 --> 00:09:18,500
Well, I like doing it, but I'm not good at it.

76
00:09:20,779 --> 00:09:21,820
Dude, I had a... That's what you would see

77
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:26,779
in all the highlight reels, though. I had a video series on Machinima Respawn,

78
00:09:26,779 --> 00:09:31,940
like 10 years ago, where I played Call of Duty. And it was...

79
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:34,899
You liked it. I mean, I was playing a character.

80
00:09:34,899 --> 00:09:39,720
It was not really me playing. It was, but it wasn't.

81
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,240
Oh, right. This gun is disgusting.

82
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:46,710
What is this thing? Should I use this? Oh, that's an LMG.

83
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:51,399
Okay. I'm going to be honest. The guns I recommend is the Fall.

84
00:09:51,399 --> 00:09:54,940
I think it's an assault rifle. That one's pretty good.

85
00:09:54,940 --> 00:10:10,809
Yeah. Let me see. I got the PDW57, Scorpion, Type 25, LSAT, and the SVUAS. Are those okay?

86
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:20,470
Yeah. But I'm telling you, the Fall is insane. You're on my team, right?

87
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:21,940
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

88
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:30,860
The Fall OST or something. Fall OSW. It's an assault rifle. It's a single fire.

89
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:35,669
It's pretty much the best gun in the game. Oh, it's single fire.

90
00:10:35,669 --> 00:10:41,590
Is this the game that had the akimbo... What was it? The akimbo scorpions or something?

91
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:46,549
Oh, I don't know if this specific one has it, but one of the Call of Duties has that, yeah.

92
00:10:46,549 --> 00:10:50,179
I remember people were like, one of that bands. People freaked out over that.

93
00:10:50,179 --> 00:10:53,940
Yeah. So the Fall is actually also banned. Oh, it's banned?

94
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:59,580
In the old tournaments of this game, it was banned because it's pretty much objectively

95
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:07,019
the best gun. It wasn't the least amount. When I go back, I might put it on. I might

96
00:11:07,019 --> 00:11:10,139
leave and put it on. I would definitely put it on,

97
00:11:10,139 --> 00:11:15,299
but I mean, it depends. If you're like a sprayer, it's not good for spraying.

98
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:19,620
Yeah. I'm kind of a hold the button down and hope that somebody dies.

99
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:28,379
Yeah. Yeah. So if you're a sprayer, maybe I'd go for like the AN-94 solid. I mean, honestly,

100
00:11:28,539 --> 00:11:31,830
none you're using is pretty decent too. It's just reducing.

101
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:36,789
Yeah. So somebody in chat just copy and pasted this build and I just put it in here. I was like,

102
00:11:36,789 --> 00:11:46,549
yeah, sure. I'll try it for a little bit. It was just a copy and paste.

103
00:11:46,549 --> 00:11:50,710
I mean, I think the thing about Call of Duty is you can't really go too wrong because every

104
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:57,500
gun kills in like two seconds. Not even two seconds, honestly. So it's like just how it goes.

105
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:01,980
Kind of. Did the game start yet? Wait, we don't play. Oh, okay. I was like, wait,

106
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:06,139
we're playing. We only have you and me here. Yeah, we're killing each other. So

107
00:12:06,139 --> 00:12:17,019
surely we're not playing yet, right? Hello. Hey. Yo. Oh, hey. We got half the team here.

108
00:12:17,019 --> 00:12:22,230
Are you guys ready to win? Oh, okay. So we have half the team. Okay. Cool. So now I'm not in like

109
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:30,710
a huge rush to make class real quick. Yeah. I've got about maybe 12 total hours in Call of Duty.

110
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:39,850
I'm going to need a hard carry. Oh, no. That's more than me, honestly. So you know what? I think

111
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:44,779
I might surprise a lot of people, though, once I get in the game mode. You know, if it means

112
00:12:44,779 --> 00:12:50,740
anything, I've never seen you be bad at a game before. I'm okay. I can be okay sometimes.

113
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:56,919
Is everything good on your end? Very humble. We got to play multi versus. Okay. Yes. I got everything

114
00:12:56,919 --> 00:13:03,159
figured out. That's just mad at the resolution. Oh, okay. Is the resolution wonky? Yeah. You just

115
00:13:03,159 --> 00:13:09,450
fix it in settings though. Oh, sick. Shit. Okay. Are we doing a server or custom class?

116
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:18,740
Uh, server. So if your classes have to be made under the ranked setting and then make your classes

117
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:43,240
there and then we'll go to server browser and then. Okay. Okay. Oh, I got a medal. Ooh. Wait,

118
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:50,230
Mithy, you're on our team? Yeah, I'm on your guys' team. Ooh. Let's go. Okay. So I'm kind of the

119
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:55,059
equivalent to John. And so I think it actually, the balance is actually pretty good still. Okay.

120
00:13:55,059 --> 00:14:09,769
Cool. Cool. Cool. Ooh. I'm glad you're on my team. I just killed like four people with a knife.

121
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:19,779
Well, I'll make it five. Oh, I forgot the shotgun thing. Okay. The knife is an instant kill no

122
00:14:19,779 --> 00:14:24,820
matter what, right? The Moss Borg. Yeah. The knife is an instant kill. It's kind of OP.

123
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:54,620
I just flashed myself. Wait, you're like doing drop shots and stuff. Jesus. Sure. You haven't

124
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:58,220
played this before. That's the first time I've clicked that button. I think the whole time we've

125
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:04,100
been here. Oh, okay. That's it's like a thing people would sometimes do. They randomly just

126
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:11,370
lay on the floor to try and dodge bullets and stuff. You're killing people that are AFK. No,

127
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:16,649
I'm not. Everyone's warming up. Yeah. Yeah. We're mostly just trying to get used to our key binds

128
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:28,659
and sensitivity. I mean, it's not like it started. It seems I am not the only spy. You know what you

129
00:15:28,659 --> 00:15:34,179
could do? Make one of those ballistic knife, like running builds or whatever. Oh, you like

130
00:15:34,179 --> 00:15:44,490
you shoot it out, right? Yeah. Yeah. I'm good. I keep hitting R with the LMG and that's not good.

131
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:58,169
I got to keep. I had to do that more often. That works it in control. When you start shooting

132
00:15:58,169 --> 00:16:06,580
people like in what case and what scenario just anytime I'm firing at anybody, I just hit control

133
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:17,080
when I go down. Is that smarter or stupid? Bro, I haven't played this since 2012.

134
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:24,809
It's so funny. Half our team is just like, oh yeah, I played Call of Duty on the toilet one time.

135
00:16:24,809 --> 00:16:35,830
It's like 2012 this game was released and I don't even think I played it on PC on top of that.

136
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:43,139
Yeah. Like all like console or something. Hey, it's all right. We have a couple people laying

137
00:16:43,139 --> 00:16:50,120
on hard carriers. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. I'm really hoping I can lay. I haven't even gotten

138
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:58,789
warmed up yet. I'm still making my classes. Is scorpion any good? Should I try scorpion?

139
00:16:58,789 --> 00:17:05,349
Oh, scorpion is pretty good. Yeah. It has a really good time to shoot super fast.

140
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:14,059
I think it's good. I could be. I haven't played this in quite some time. I'm never taking this off.

141
00:17:15,059 --> 00:17:21,670
Bro, there's no way you just. You run out of ammo so fast. What happens if you run out of ammo?

142
00:17:22,809 --> 00:17:28,779
Well, you should. Is that it? I think if you have scavenger on, you should be fine.

143
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:36,859
So the strat is to get someone else. Are we doing S and D? Yeah, what's the game? What do we do for

144
00:17:36,859 --> 00:17:41,900
game mode? I'm guessing it's fivey five. So I'm guessing it's an S and D. Yeah. Right. Oh, no.

145
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:48,460
So just go to the tournament browser or the browser and then it's the server on there.

146
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:54,309
I think I'm going to use this. Sorry. Was that not the question that I come in?

147
00:17:58,579 --> 00:18:06,490
All right. I was saying like the the this is times two. Oh, the game. Oh, so it's going to be

148
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:15,269
a hard point. Dom and S and D. Oh, OK. We almost ready, Kelly. Yeah, I'm almost done making my

149
00:18:15,269 --> 00:18:35,380
classes. Sorry. OK. Well, that's really bad. Hello. Just hear me. Yeah. Yes. That doesn't

150
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:40,819
fucking my audio. My mic is like bugging. Should be fine, though. You sound pretty clean. You're

151
00:18:40,819 --> 00:18:46,500
here. All right. Cool. I can hear you. All right. Let me make one more class just in case. And

152
00:18:46,500 --> 00:19:38,900
then nobody spawn here. You don't spawn in line at line of sight. Oh, oh, all right.

153
00:19:42,119 --> 00:19:51,589
I look like a fucking idiot. I I'm I'm baffled. I'm just walking into walls. I was testing

154
00:19:51,589 --> 00:20:12,279
something. Look, what am I doing over here? I'm worse than a bot right now. I do like this gun,

155
00:20:12,279 --> 00:20:22,410
though. I'm going to keep it. Yeah. This this thing, you just have to just let the game play

156
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:43,990
for you. Why are you using target finder? What's that? What do you mean? Do I have

157
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:52,809
target? What does that mean? I hope I didn't make a mistake or anything.

158
00:21:04,259 --> 00:21:06,900
How has it been 10 years and some of these guns are still not fixed?

159
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:13,779
I mean, it's been 10 years and their game client has never been fixed.

160
00:21:15,960 --> 00:22:02,380
I was like AFK making a sandwich. 360 no scope me. I got hit. My knife button is weird. I'm

161
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:14,569
going to change it. I'm just working on my sensitivity and then I'm ready.

162
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:49,829
OK, you guys get disconnected from the server. Use your radar last time. That didn't work

163
00:22:49,829 --> 00:23:01,819
last time. Well, they don't work. Oh, my resolution. Oh, is it just mega fucked?

164
00:23:01,819 --> 00:23:23,690
Oh, fuck. I'm sorry about that. So what is search and destroy?

165
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:30,940
I was I was played. It's kind of like Valorant. All right. For someone who would explain a game

166
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:37,000
mode to someone that's never played Valorant. So basically one team is defending a bomb site

167
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:43,579
and then another team is trying to attack it. OK, and the the team that's attacking has to plant

168
00:23:43,579 --> 00:23:47,339
the bomb. And then if the bomb detonates, they win the round and the defending team has to defuse

169
00:23:47,339 --> 00:23:52,940
the bomb. So it's like Counter-Strike. Oh, yeah. That honestly, that would have been such a better

170
00:23:52,940 --> 00:24:00,259
example. And no response. Yes. Yeah, no response. So you die, you die. OK. Till the next round.

171
00:24:01,059 --> 00:24:24,940
Counter-Strike is Valorant. I have not played Valorant. I played Counter-Strike maybe a little.

172
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:29,819
Why are you making fun of how I'm saying that Valorant? What's what's what's wrong with that?

173
00:24:29,819 --> 00:24:36,180
Valorant. All right, Kaylee, is it ready to go? Please tell me everything. Did I get the kill?

174
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:42,329
That would have been funny on the screen. Is there any way that we can help?

175
00:24:44,039 --> 00:24:47,799
Valorant. No, no, no, I got it. I'm figuring it out. I'm just kind of like

176
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:56,490
up like that. OK, OK. Well, we're just whenever everyone of you guys are ready,

177
00:24:56,490 --> 00:24:59,849
let's go up to the team one and then we'll start up once everyone's on the server.

178
00:25:06,119 --> 00:25:11,720
All right. So so are we playing on Newtown first? You know what you're doing.

179
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:17,380
Me? Who? Yeah, you know. Yeah, don't don't mean me. Yeah, you know what you're doing.

180
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:25,900
I mean, I played when I was like 13. So I mean, I've played once or twice. Like riding a bike.

181
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:30,859
Wait, Dean, you definitely know what you're doing, too, right? No, no, I missed like three

182
00:25:30,859 --> 00:25:35,019
times. Are you using the DSR 50 or the ballista? It's one of the preset it.

183
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:42,950
You're using a preset. Yeah, it'll probably be. I wasn't trying to use a sniper like during this

184
00:25:43,829 --> 00:25:48,549
situation. Yeah, I'm not confident to use anything that requires any amount of skill to aim.

185
00:25:50,019 --> 00:25:58,539
Not now. Yeah, that's it's honestly respectable. I mean, I'll go in 20 and be the embarrassment.

186
00:25:58,539 --> 00:26:02,599
Like there's no like prize money or anything, right? I mean, I think it's just fun.

187
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:08,839
OK, yeah, yeah, just making sure just it's bragging rights doesn't have to be for money.

188
00:26:08,839 --> 00:26:14,279
It's for bragging rights. Oh, I mean, I already take a picture of me shooting symphony and killing

189
00:26:14,279 --> 00:26:28,490
him for myself. You know, I'm just I'm trying to pretend to be dead. Oh, shit. Hello.

190
00:26:30,099 --> 00:26:36,420
Just quickly, we're just checking that everything's OK. And does anybody need advice

191
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:46,859
or help of anything? I think I'm it's working for me. Yeah, my my resolution is not wanting

192
00:26:46,859 --> 00:26:54,630
to do the thing. No worries. Do you want to I'm not sure if we can, but did you want to put

193
00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:59,670
into the general voice channel and we'll try and get into well, I think we're watching your

194
00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:09,299
screen, to be honest, so we could probably try and offer some help screen resolution.

195
00:27:09,299 --> 00:27:19,700
Honestly, fuck shit. I mean, it's fine. Just I can count the pixels. I mean, if you want to

196
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:25,559
spend two minutes with us to see if we can sort it, that's fine. We're happy to do that.

197
00:27:25,559 --> 00:27:31,960
Otherwise, if you're happy to play Minecraft on Black Ops 2, then you know, I really don't.

198
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:37,299
Wait, I'm being told to change it. Maybe it's that's probably a good shout.

199
00:27:38,259 --> 00:27:48,250
Oh, oh, oh, wow. Holy shit. OK. OK, well, we figured it out. Cool.

200
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:54,089
It was like you put on glasses. Yeah, I'm going to jump scare strap. Yeah.

201
00:27:56,089 --> 00:28:02,740
You guys have a good and enjoy. Thanks. Have you? Oh, no, that was the server. OK,

202
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:27,559
let's say you to tell me this is a good scrap. You just pretend to be dead and nobody even cares.

203
00:28:27,559 --> 00:28:40,339
Oh, we got to start this. OK. Give me one second. I'm joining. Yeah, I just did the. Oh,

204
00:28:40,339 --> 00:29:00,250
yeah. You too. Yeah, you too. Oh, I'm going to do this right in the fucking doorway.

205
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:51,190
You've heard that guy. I'm a fucking moron. Oh, no. How long were you there for?

206
00:29:51,269 --> 00:29:54,549
I'm doing the jumps. Oh, wait, we're supposed to be up to the channel.

207
00:29:54,549 --> 00:30:07,859
Just be like frozen that long. It's crazy. I'm doing the jump scare strategy. Oh,

208
00:30:07,859 --> 00:30:16,119
what you doing over there? Boob's key. All right, we have everybody in the channel.

209
00:30:16,119 --> 00:30:24,119
Are you ready? What's up, y'all? Yo, yo, yo.

210
00:30:24,119 --> 00:30:30,970
OK, I think you just need to join the server and then we can start it.

211
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:33,369
That score that was sixty nine, sixty nine.

212
00:30:33,369 --> 00:30:46,519
Sorry, I can barely hear anybody. What's up? It was crazy. Oh, shit. Whoops.

213
00:30:46,519 --> 00:31:01,619
I think we're starting soon. Silence. Oh, I'm very ready.

214
00:31:01,619 --> 00:31:06,869
This is going to be fun. This is going to be fun. OK, they had a game with confidence.

215
00:31:06,869 --> 00:31:09,450
I don't think people know what the fuck I'm talking about.

216
00:31:11,930 --> 00:31:14,170
I think people are just like, oh, that's the weird guy.

217
00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:31,900
OK, well, I don't know what he's what he's what he's saying, but got him.

218
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:35,900
Um, is it the tournament server? Yes.

219
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:38,940
Is it the only one showing up? I want to make sure.

220
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:41,579
This is like fun. I'm having more fun than the tournament.

221
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:44,619
Oh, it is. It's the yeah, it's the only server we got.

222
00:31:45,259 --> 00:31:53,380
OK, are we green light to start this bad boy up for game one?

223
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:56,119
Are we ready? Ready to go.

224
00:31:56,119 --> 00:31:57,079
All right, I'm going to go confirm.

225
00:31:57,079 --> 00:32:02,299
Let's go. Trying to make it look like I fucking no idea what's going on.

226
00:32:05,339 --> 00:32:08,089
All right. Wow, I'm sorry.

227
00:32:08,089 --> 00:32:11,339
It's going to start up here and then there'll be 60 seconds.

228
00:32:11,339 --> 00:32:14,140
And then we just go to your team to go to team two.

229
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:19,859
Wait, what now? I think are we are we are we going here?

230
00:32:19,859 --> 00:32:23,990
This is it right now. This is it. This is it.

231
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:26,980
All right. This is it. I got to go two headphones here.

232
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:33,140
All right. Let's go. Let's go team.

233
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:34,660
All right. What's what's the strategy?

234
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:37,940
Going with a cheese class to start. And if it doesn't work, I'll switch.

235
00:32:41,079 --> 00:32:42,359
Oh, God.

236
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,200
Can I just tether to somebody that knows where they're going?

237
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,279
Oh, my God. Yeah, absolutely.

238
00:32:48,279 --> 00:32:50,440
All right, I'm going to I'm literally going to walk just behind you.

239
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:52,920
Yeah, get my cover. Get my get my back up.

240
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,039
You got it. Let's go. We're playing.

241
00:32:54,039 --> 00:32:57,559
We're playing hard point here. So this is there's going to be a little site

242
00:32:57,559 --> 00:33:00,599
that we just kind of have to sit on. And if you get points, it's king of the hill.

243
00:33:00,599 --> 00:33:03,000
Basically, it's not searching the story. It's not.

244
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,880
Oh, this is king of the hill. This is like this king of the hill.

245
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,380
Yep. All right. All right. Right.

246
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:08,980
Is it friendly fire? We got this. We got this.

247
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:11,059
No friendly fire. All right. Nades across. Nades across.

248
00:33:11,059 --> 00:33:13,380
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Let's go.

249
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:16,019
You said nades across and I just did it.

250
00:33:16,019 --> 00:33:19,740
What? Yeah, my point is online.

251
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:23,099
And the guy just got insta killed. I got bodied.

252
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:26,920
OK, they got control. We got to take control of that.

253
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:38,250
Got a person off of it. Sniper in a window behind us.

254
00:33:39,210 --> 00:33:41,690
Yeah, the spawns just constantly change.

255
00:33:42,329 --> 00:33:48,339
Yes. Keeps you on your toes.

256
00:33:48,339 --> 00:33:52,099
I hate to say it, but my settings fucking resets.

257
00:33:52,099 --> 00:33:53,380
Let's go. Let's go. Yeah.

258
00:33:55,339 --> 00:33:58,700
Honestly, if you just want to take a second in the game, like I don't feel free.

259
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:00,940
Yeah, I am right now. Yeah.

260
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:02,779
Oh, God. Not the shock.

261
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:06,779
I'm going to fucking mega sweat right now to get us some fucking points.

262
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:14,570
I have no ammo. We need stuns on Sightman.

263
00:34:15,289 --> 00:34:20,619
Why is the motherfucker running around with knives? Who is that?

264
00:34:21,619 --> 00:34:26,579
We're not going up. Next point online.

265
00:34:26,579 --> 00:34:30,489
I got somebody. Nading the room.

266
00:34:30,489 --> 00:34:35,139
I'm going to nade the room also. I'm not going to nade their spawn.

267
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:38,500
I'm going in for the point. Going around back.

268
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:41,139
Oh, he got a collab. What?

269
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:44,019
You got a collab. Are they upstairs?

270
00:34:45,139 --> 00:34:48,019
Not one on the car. Oh, they're coming into the room.

271
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:52,489
They flashed me out. Oh, I got them.

272
00:34:53,210 --> 00:34:56,659
Let's go. Where do I go?

273
00:34:56,659 --> 00:35:00,070
And are they in a circle?

274
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:05,670
The left, you know, you don't.

275
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:07,590
He's camping behind the thing.

276
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:11,320
Did I get somebody?

277
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:15,179
They got hardpoint control still.

278
00:35:15,739 --> 00:35:17,989
I'm nading it and I'm going in.

279
00:35:17,989 --> 00:35:20,389
Oh, John is just sniping it back in their spawn.

280
00:35:21,530 --> 00:35:23,530
Like a little bitch. All right, we got hardpoint, though.

281
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:26,489
Sorry, I freaked out.

282
00:35:27,289 --> 00:35:30,409
You're good. Defend this shit.

283
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:32,460
It's comeback season.

284
00:35:35,659 --> 00:35:36,940
All right, everyone's up. Buddha down.

285
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:38,300
We're good. We're good. Just pull together.

286
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:39,179
We can do it. We got it. We got it.

287
00:35:39,179 --> 00:35:42,059
Yeah, we're getting the lead.

288
00:35:42,059 --> 00:35:43,420
Wait, somebody's contesting me.

289
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:44,619
Oh, I got him. I smoked him.

290
00:35:46,889 --> 00:35:48,570
Oh, Val's on a hardpoint.

291
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:57,530
No, he's holding the right spawn.

292
00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:58,889
Yeah, dude, I can't get in there.

293
00:36:00,019 --> 00:36:04,119
Okay, got him. Spawn's clear.

294
00:36:04,119 --> 00:36:08,409
Going in for the point, coach.

295
00:36:09,579 --> 00:36:10,619
Put me in, coach.

296
00:36:14,090 --> 00:36:15,929
Oh, I got sniped.

297
00:36:15,929 --> 00:36:16,889
I'm locked in right now.

298
00:36:16,889 --> 00:36:19,369
Oh my God. John's just killing everybody.

299
00:36:19,849 --> 00:36:21,849
Yo, Jerma, I'm trying.

300
00:36:21,849 --> 00:36:23,530
I'm trying as hard as I can, baby.

301
00:36:23,530 --> 00:36:25,289
No, I see you trying as hard as I can.

302
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:26,820
Hell yeah.

303
00:36:30,019 --> 00:36:31,539
I don't even see where they're killing.

304
00:36:31,539 --> 00:36:32,980
That's what I like to see, dude.

305
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:34,820
He's an FPS gamer.

306
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:35,780
I'm a gamer sometimes.

307
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:36,980
Hell yeah.

308
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:41,179
What matters?

309
00:36:43,639 --> 00:36:44,440
Wait, they're ahead?

310
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:48,039
Yeah, but it's going to come back.

311
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:49,639
Yeah, yeah, we're going to come back.

312
00:36:50,199 --> 00:36:52,500
We get this point.

313
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:54,019
So this point downstairs, careful.

314
00:36:54,659 --> 00:36:56,099
We got control outside right now.

315
00:36:56,099 --> 00:36:57,219
Second floor, second floor, second floor.

316
00:36:57,219 --> 00:36:57,719
No.

317
00:37:01,030 --> 00:37:01,829
There we go, there we go.

318
00:37:03,989 --> 00:37:04,489
Oh no.

319
00:37:05,349 --> 00:37:06,780
What is this, an FAL?

320
00:37:08,739 --> 00:37:09,940
Oh my goodness, the whole team's here.

321
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:14,139
Take a point.

322
00:37:15,269 --> 00:37:15,829
FAL.

323
00:37:15,829 --> 00:37:16,630
Fuck, I'm off point.

324
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:18,869
Is it busted?

325
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:24,380
All right, point switch, point switch.

326
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:27,019
Yep, we got to get my way over.

327
00:37:27,019 --> 00:37:27,659
We got to recap.

328
00:37:27,659 --> 00:37:28,460
Yeah, they're on this shit.

329
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:32,059
Big ol' faxes.

330
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:34,010
Unlucky.

331
00:37:34,809 --> 00:37:36,969
I'm 3 and 12, love my life.

332
00:37:36,969 --> 00:37:37,929
Oh no.

333
00:37:37,929 --> 00:37:38,969
Fuck it, it ain't over.

334
00:37:38,969 --> 00:37:40,090
It's far from it.

335
00:37:40,090 --> 00:37:42,219
We got a shot, we got a shot.

336
00:37:42,219 --> 00:37:42,860
Yeah, still got a chance.

337
00:37:44,059 --> 00:37:46,139
My game started off so bad.

338
00:37:46,139 --> 00:37:46,780
Unlucky.

339
00:37:47,579 --> 00:37:48,380
No, fuck that.

340
00:37:50,059 --> 00:37:51,019
I turned around three times.

341
00:37:51,019 --> 00:37:51,820
I don't know where I am.

342
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:54,300
Hey, hey, okay, we have to give them a little bit of hope.

343
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:55,019
You know what I'm saying?

344
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,760
Aim down, what are you stupid?

345
00:38:00,559 --> 00:38:01,059
No.

346
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,360
All right, we got a point.

347
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,239
Yeah, yeah.

348
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,760
Oh my, so many stuns.

349
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:06,320
Recoil.

350
00:38:07,039 --> 00:38:10,800
Yeah, we just got to fight for it and wipe them and then take a point.

351
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,880
Because they're just fucking going to throw stuns on that shit instantly.

352
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:13,599
I got one with me.

353
00:38:14,639 --> 00:38:16,000
He's Buddha's cross.

354
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:16,960
Riding down on the ground.

355
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:17,760
Teen cross.

356
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,599
You got Buddha?

357
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:21,599
Not any good.

358
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:22,159
I'm going to get him right now.

359
00:38:22,159 --> 00:38:22,559
I got you.

360
00:38:22,559 --> 00:38:23,119
Go get him, yeah.

361
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:24,400
Go get him and then I'm going to push in.

362
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,039
He's dead, he's dead.

363
00:38:26,639 --> 00:38:27,280
Excellent.

364
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:27,780
Got Ray.

365
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,699
Can you flash your own teammates?

366
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:36,139
No, it sucks.

367
00:38:36,139 --> 00:38:37,980
I didn't get time to warm up.

368
00:38:38,619 --> 00:38:39,179
Oh no.

369
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:43,480
Now we're good, we're good.

370
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:44,599
We'll pull back.

371
00:38:44,599 --> 00:38:48,110
Start spamming.

372
00:38:48,110 --> 00:38:52,010
What button is fucking default for nation?

373
00:38:52,010 --> 00:38:52,889
I got point, I got point.

374
00:38:53,530 --> 00:38:54,809
No, no, like a utility.

375
00:38:55,610 --> 00:39:04,599
We're good, we're good, we're good.

376
00:39:05,679 --> 00:39:06,559
We're good, we're good, we're good.

377
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:08,719
We're good, we're good.

378
00:39:08,719 --> 00:39:09,519
We're good, we're good.

379
00:39:10,969 --> 00:39:12,409
Big points on the board right now.

380
00:39:12,409 --> 00:39:13,130
Big points.

381
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:17,000
I killed myself.

382
00:39:18,599 --> 00:39:19,800
Somebody get in there, somebody get in there.

383
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:20,599
I'm holding, I'm holding long.

384
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:21,239
I'm holding long.

385
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,679
Next point, where's that outside?

386
00:39:32,039 --> 00:39:33,239
All right, I got to pull it together here.

387
00:39:33,239 --> 00:39:33,960
I got to pull it together.

388
00:39:34,519 --> 00:39:34,760
Yeah.

389
00:39:40,090 --> 00:39:41,369
We got, he got all of us.

390
00:39:42,809 --> 00:39:44,090
Every single one of us.

391
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:46,250
All right, let's go, let's go a different way, you know?

392
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:47,210
Yeah, let's go, let's go.

393
00:39:47,210 --> 00:39:48,090
Across.

394
00:39:48,090 --> 00:39:50,570
I'm trying to get Buddha.

395
00:39:50,570 --> 00:39:51,130
I can't move.

396
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:54,670
Got him, got him.

397
00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:56,750
Oh, they're holding inside the house.

398
00:39:56,750 --> 00:39:57,389
They're holding the house.

399
00:39:59,789 --> 00:40:01,150
About to kick him for inside the house.

400
00:40:01,869 --> 00:40:05,710
One outside by car.

401
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:09,820
Going inside of the house.

402
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:14,079
I'm fucking running right in there.

403
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:14,719
I got control.

404
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:18,860
One more, one more.

405
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:19,659
Right next to the house.

406
00:40:22,539 --> 00:40:24,699
You stun-grenading fucking bitch.

407
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:29,019
I'm holding car, I'm holding car.

408
00:40:30,059 --> 00:40:30,380
Yeah.

409
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:33,260
Dude, I'm going to fucking, who is that?

410
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:34,219
Hold that, hold that, hold that.

411
00:40:35,019 --> 00:40:35,980
I got car.

412
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:37,260
How did I not get the kill?

413
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:39,099
I don't understand what the mathematical equation was.

414
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:40,860
That's a big three.

415
00:40:41,659 --> 00:40:42,300
Oh, God.

416
00:40:43,019 --> 00:40:44,059
Oh, it's four.

417
00:40:52,670 --> 00:40:54,539
I'm back on point.

418
00:40:54,539 --> 00:40:56,619
I didn't have any fucking bullets in my machine gun.

419
00:40:57,500 --> 00:41:04,030
What?

420
00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:04,269
Right.

421
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:08,300
Inside the car, inside the car.

422
00:41:09,179 --> 00:41:09,739
Bitch.

423
00:41:09,739 --> 00:41:10,300
Oh, God.

424
00:41:11,019 --> 00:41:11,820
It's okay, it's okay.

425
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:12,219
Excuse me.

426
00:41:12,219 --> 00:41:12,780
We can get this still.

427
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:18,219
I'll take it.

428
00:41:18,219 --> 00:41:19,980
Oh, fuck, I can't move.

429
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:22,170
No, it's a stun-nade.

430
00:41:23,289 --> 00:41:24,570
I'm tired of getting stunned.

431
00:41:25,690 --> 00:41:26,699
Next point up.

432
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:28,300
Shit, Jermall, let's go.

433
00:41:29,019 --> 00:41:30,219
Jermall, that's me.

434
00:41:30,219 --> 00:41:30,460
What?

435
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:31,420
That's you, that's you.

436
00:41:32,059 --> 00:41:33,900
Oh, I thought that was a bad guy.

437
00:41:34,139 --> 00:41:41,900
Oh, they're all over that car, man.

438
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:43,519
We'll even fuck out of it.

439
00:41:43,519 --> 00:41:45,599
I got to, I was, I started so well.

440
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:46,079
Come on.

441
00:41:46,719 --> 00:41:47,360
They got one.

442
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:51,070
They got two players playing across, one going into our spawn.

443
00:41:51,949 --> 00:41:52,429
Watch out.

444
00:41:52,429 --> 00:41:52,750
Oops.

445
00:41:53,230 --> 00:41:54,030
All right, point.

446
00:41:54,030 --> 00:41:59,019
Yeah, we're back on point.

447
00:41:59,019 --> 00:42:00,380
Second floor, second floor.

448
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:09,840
Oh, don't go for two back because you're flipping spawns.

449
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:10,639
Yeah.

450
00:42:10,639 --> 00:42:15,440
So if we contain mid control and just hold them out and spawn, we should be fine.

451
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:16,320
Come on, we should be fine.

452
00:42:19,099 --> 00:42:19,980
Next point up soon.

453
00:42:20,619 --> 00:42:23,440
I couldn't see there's no smoke.

454
00:42:25,289 --> 00:42:26,170
New point, our point.

455
00:42:26,809 --> 00:42:28,409
All right, we defend, defend, defend.

456
00:42:28,409 --> 00:42:33,900
I'm holding this fucking door.

457
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:35,199
Ain't nobody getting through here.

458
00:42:36,190 --> 00:42:39,710
Chad, how the fuck do I use my goddamn stun-nade, man?

459
00:42:41,309 --> 00:42:42,190
Oh, I didn't see him.

460
00:42:42,190 --> 00:42:46,750
Flank, flank, flank.

461
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:47,949
Oh, I was out in the open.

462
00:42:50,829 --> 00:42:51,949
Oh, it's four.

463
00:42:51,949 --> 00:42:52,989
God bless.

464
00:42:52,989 --> 00:42:53,550
Where are they at?

465
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:56,519
On point and they're spawning.

466
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:57,960
Across.

467
00:43:03,289 --> 00:43:03,849
Oh, one is.

468
00:43:04,650 --> 00:43:06,380
Gotta get in there.

469
00:43:07,739 --> 00:43:09,019
I'm going in, I'm on point, I'm on point.

470
00:43:10,059 --> 00:43:11,260
Fuck, he was behind me.

471
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:11,900
Nice, nice.

472
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:12,539
Oh, god damn it.

473
00:43:15,179 --> 00:43:16,059
Nade it, nade it, nade it.

474
00:43:16,059 --> 00:43:16,559
Oh.

475
00:43:19,639 --> 00:43:21,469
Nice try, nice try, nice try.

476
00:43:21,469 --> 00:43:22,909
It's the first game on.

477
00:43:22,909 --> 00:43:23,550
Oh, god.

478
00:43:24,110 --> 00:43:25,869
I got my settings figured out.

479
00:43:25,869 --> 00:43:27,630
So we got the next one.

480
00:43:27,630 --> 00:43:28,190
Hell yeah.

481
00:43:28,190 --> 00:43:29,070
The settings.

482
00:43:29,070 --> 00:43:29,789
All right, we're good, we're good.

483
00:43:29,789 --> 00:43:30,829
Team one to talk shit.

484
00:43:32,409 --> 00:43:40,380
Not bad.

485
00:43:44,139 --> 00:43:44,860
That was not bad.

486
00:43:44,860 --> 00:43:47,500
Definitely, we could have done worse, that's for sure.

487
00:43:50,570 --> 00:43:53,289
Definitely gotta do tasks, Matt.

488
00:43:53,289 --> 00:43:55,150
Should I stick with this?

489
00:43:55,150 --> 00:43:56,429
No, I don't know.

490
00:43:57,820 --> 00:43:58,320
Yeah.

491
00:43:58,619 --> 00:43:59,679
So wait, are we going again?

492
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:01,280
Yeah.

493
00:44:03,389 --> 00:44:04,030
Nice job.

494
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:06,960
Good game, good game, everybody.

495
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:08,239
You don't fuck with that, you don't fuck with that.

496
00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:11,739
I didn't even talk shit.

497
00:44:11,739 --> 00:44:13,500
I just went up there and said, good game, everybody.

498
00:44:14,059 --> 00:44:15,690
That was it.

499
00:44:15,690 --> 00:44:16,489
Nice, nice.

500
00:44:16,489 --> 00:44:17,530
I didn't do anything else.

501
00:44:18,510 --> 00:44:19,230
My god.

502
00:44:20,519 --> 00:44:22,730
Is all good to go for the next one?

503
00:44:22,730 --> 00:44:24,170
Yeah, I'm ready, I'm ready.

504
00:44:24,170 --> 00:44:25,739
All right, let's run it.

505
00:44:25,739 --> 00:44:27,230
I'll just do this.

506
00:44:27,230 --> 00:44:28,110
What's the next game mode?

507
00:44:31,050 --> 00:44:32,250
Let me double check real quick.

508
00:44:32,250 --> 00:44:33,289
It is going to be...

509
00:44:36,059 --> 00:44:36,780
Oh, god.

510
00:44:38,489 --> 00:44:39,130
Yeah, where are we going?

511
00:44:39,949 --> 00:44:41,230
Domination hijack.

512
00:44:41,789 --> 00:44:44,079
Ooh, should I use that?

513
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:46,079
That's the one where you take the points, right?

514
00:44:48,030 --> 00:44:48,670
Yes.

515
00:44:48,670 --> 00:44:50,590
Basically try to hold what, A and B?

516
00:44:50,590 --> 00:44:56,010
A and B.

517
00:44:56,010 --> 00:44:57,210
How do COD pros do this?

518
00:44:59,690 --> 00:45:01,610
I don't know, it's a tough game.

519
00:45:01,610 --> 00:45:02,889
It's a very, very quick game.

520
00:45:02,889 --> 00:45:04,170
We're having fun and I'm stressed out.

521
00:45:06,809 --> 00:45:09,150
I can't even think about a goddamn actual...

522
00:45:10,719 --> 00:45:11,920
Yeah, it's tense.

523
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:14,000
There's absolutely no way I don't have diarrhea later.

524
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:14,559
Like, there's no way.

525
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:22,880
It's absolutely guaranteed.

526
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:28,380
I'll go for A here if we want to send people to B off the rip.

527
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:30,780
All right, I'll go to B and I'll go...

528
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:33,420
You know what I mean?

529
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:34,539
Yeah, I'm going to just push B.

530
00:45:34,539 --> 00:45:35,420
Yeah, yeah.

531
00:45:35,420 --> 00:45:36,380
I'm going to go to B and just go...

532
00:45:39,019 --> 00:45:40,590
Good strat.

533
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,300
Nice.

534
00:45:49,769 --> 00:45:51,610
Oh, okay, they're hard pushed left.

535
00:45:51,610 --> 00:45:53,530
They're going in, they're going in.

536
00:45:53,530 --> 00:45:56,139
Roger, stun aiding B.

537
00:45:56,940 --> 00:45:58,059
Pushing out left.

538
00:45:58,059 --> 00:45:59,099
They're right in this little area here.

539
00:46:01,019 --> 00:46:02,059
I can't see anything.

540
00:46:03,579 --> 00:46:03,820
What?

541
00:46:03,820 --> 00:46:05,099
I got somebody.

542
00:46:05,820 --> 00:46:06,219
What?

543
00:46:06,219 --> 00:46:07,099
How am I still here?

544
00:46:08,519 --> 00:46:09,800
Capping, capping, capping.

545
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:16,280
I'm holding...

546
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:17,079
I'm going to cap it.

547
00:46:17,079 --> 00:46:18,760
Oh, no, I'm not.

548
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:19,630
I'm going in.

549
00:46:20,250 --> 00:46:22,880
We got to get a wipe on them and then we got to go for it.

550
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:24,480
Oh, they're in the window up top.

551
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:25,119
Oh, they pushed through.

552
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:25,760
The fuckers.

553
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:29,719
Nading.

554
00:46:29,719 --> 00:46:30,760
Got them out, got them off of it.

555
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:35,019
One is in our spawn.

556
00:46:35,019 --> 00:46:36,139
They're behind us.

557
00:46:36,139 --> 00:46:36,699
What?

558
00:46:36,699 --> 00:46:37,019
Yeah.

559
00:46:39,289 --> 00:46:40,570
Oh my God, the whole team's on B.

560
00:46:43,789 --> 00:46:44,429
Excuse me?

561
00:46:45,150 --> 00:46:47,769
Hey, this fucking guy's symphony, man.

562
00:46:47,769 --> 00:46:48,969
They still haven't gotten B though yet.

563
00:46:48,969 --> 00:46:49,929
We're still in this.

564
00:46:49,929 --> 00:46:50,250
Yeah.

565
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:57,420
I'm going to go from the outside of the boat.

566
00:46:57,420 --> 00:46:58,460
I'm going to get a little flank on.

567
00:46:59,739 --> 00:47:01,019
They have somebody holding them across.

568
00:47:01,019 --> 00:47:02,059
So as soon as you go to B, he's like...

569
00:47:02,059 --> 00:47:03,260
I got those here, I got those here.

570
00:47:03,260 --> 00:47:03,900
Yeah, I got them crossed.

571
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:04,539
Good shit, good shit.

572
00:47:04,539 --> 00:47:04,780
All right.

573
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:05,340
I'm getting on site.

574
00:47:05,340 --> 00:47:05,900
I'm getting on site.

575
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:06,619
We're getting on site.

576
00:47:06,619 --> 00:47:07,659
Oh, they just threw a nade.

577
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:10,400
Ready to play good D?

578
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:11,920
I got one that threw a nade.

579
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:13,519
Oh, it's half capped.

580
00:47:13,519 --> 00:47:14,019
Fuck.

581
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:16,500
Fuck.

582
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:19,280
Oh, right behind...

583
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:19,780
Oh, wow.

584
00:47:20,639 --> 00:47:21,280
You know what I'm going to do?

585
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:22,880
I'm going to go for C cap.

586
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:26,250
I'm on it, I'm on it.

587
00:47:26,250 --> 00:47:27,449
I'm on cap and B, cap and B, cap and B.

588
00:47:27,929 --> 00:47:28,889
I need some support.

589
00:47:28,889 --> 00:47:29,530
Oh, I'm dead.

590
00:47:29,530 --> 00:47:30,489
I'm coming.

591
00:47:30,489 --> 00:47:34,699
I'm pretty low.

592
00:47:34,699 --> 00:47:35,900
I'm going to stay alive.

593
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:37,579
That's all we're going to do is stay alive.

594
00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:38,800
True.

595
00:47:43,050 --> 00:47:44,409
I think they're going left heavy.

596
00:47:45,130 --> 00:47:46,570
Yeah, no, that's all they keep going.

597
00:47:47,289 --> 00:47:48,250
Not the head camera on the right side.

598
00:47:48,250 --> 00:47:48,809
I'm going to look long.

599
00:47:48,809 --> 00:47:49,449
I'm going to look long.

600
00:47:50,489 --> 00:47:51,210
I'm with you, okay?

601
00:47:51,210 --> 00:47:52,010
All clear.

602
00:47:52,010 --> 00:47:52,889
Oh, I almost got it.

603
00:47:52,889 --> 00:47:53,389
Fuck.

604
00:47:55,550 --> 00:47:56,429
On site, on site, on site.

605
00:47:56,429 --> 00:47:57,869
Nade site, nade site.

606
00:47:57,869 --> 00:47:58,190
Nading.

607
00:47:58,190 --> 00:47:58,690
Oh.

608
00:47:59,469 --> 00:48:00,110
Oh, I missed.

609
00:48:00,829 --> 00:48:03,070
They're going to cap it, I think.

610
00:48:03,869 --> 00:48:05,230
No, they're getting that.

611
00:48:06,030 --> 00:48:06,429
No, I'm not.

612
00:48:06,429 --> 00:48:06,750
I'm nading.

613
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:07,710
I'm nading, nading it.

614
00:48:07,710 --> 00:48:08,210
Nice.

615
00:48:09,150 --> 00:48:09,949
Oh, hit him.

616
00:48:09,949 --> 00:48:10,429
Oh my God.

617
00:48:10,429 --> 00:48:10,989
He's not dead.

618
00:48:14,159 --> 00:48:15,039
Or spawn, or spawn.

619
00:48:15,039 --> 00:48:15,920
I think we're going to flip.

620
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:17,199
Oh, they're at the right side, right side, right side.

621
00:48:19,789 --> 00:48:20,670
I got to pull together here.

622
00:48:21,389 --> 00:48:26,090
On the outside of the boat.

623
00:48:26,090 --> 00:48:26,489
Got him.

624
00:48:26,489 --> 00:48:27,289
Good shit, good shit.

625
00:48:27,289 --> 00:48:27,849
All right, I got a...

626
00:48:28,650 --> 00:48:32,250
I got three down.

627
00:48:32,250 --> 00:48:33,929
Fucking the bitching window, man.

628
00:48:38,199 --> 00:48:39,239
All right, good shit, good shit, good shit.

629
00:48:42,719 --> 00:48:45,679
All right, I'm going to push through and try to hit B.

630
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:49,239
Hard right, hard right, hard right, hard right, hard right.

631
00:48:49,239 --> 00:48:56,730
I'm watching them as they come out of the right side here.

632
00:48:56,730 --> 00:48:57,690
I'm going to try to hold down.

633
00:48:57,690 --> 00:48:59,849
We might be able to get on site a little bit.

634
00:49:00,489 --> 00:49:03,130
Oh, there's somebody on our side, second floor.

635
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:06,139
Fuck you, John.

636
00:49:17,579 --> 00:49:18,619
Oh, I hit him in the head.

637
00:49:19,179 --> 00:49:20,719
I'm in our window trying to hold it down.

638
00:49:21,519 --> 00:49:29,400
Behind, behind, behind.

639
00:49:30,039 --> 00:49:34,429
That's on my own team, man.

640
00:49:35,150 --> 00:49:36,110
Good shit, good shit, good shit.

641
00:49:36,110 --> 00:49:38,190
I'm trying to hold for you.

642
00:49:39,150 --> 00:49:40,510
I'm right there.

643
00:49:40,510 --> 00:49:41,230
Fuck.

644
00:49:41,230 --> 00:49:42,320
No, no, no, no.

645
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:43,280
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

646
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:43,599
I'm here.

647
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:49,340
I'm going to go inside mid to your left.

648
00:49:50,860 --> 00:49:53,739
I got one.

649
00:49:53,739 --> 00:49:54,780
Good shit, good shit, good shit.

650
00:49:54,780 --> 00:49:55,099
Another time.

651
00:49:55,099 --> 00:49:55,900
Now is our fucking time.

652
00:49:55,900 --> 00:49:56,380
I'm pushing inside.

653
00:49:56,380 --> 00:49:58,300
Behind, behind, behind, behind, behind us.

654
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:00,380
Behind where?

655
00:50:01,179 --> 00:50:01,579
Behind B.

656
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:03,179
Our window.

657
00:50:03,179 --> 00:50:03,980
I'm holding, I'm holding.

658
00:50:03,980 --> 00:50:05,099
Almost there, almost there, almost there.

659
00:50:05,099 --> 00:50:05,500
All right.

660
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:07,019
They're on top of our yacht, by the way.

661
00:50:07,019 --> 00:50:09,039
I got him, I got him, I got him, I got him.

662
00:50:09,039 --> 00:50:09,599
Oh.

663
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:10,400
Got one.

664
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:12,780
Where am I getting shot from?

665
00:50:12,780 --> 00:50:16,750
Fuck.

666
00:50:16,750 --> 00:50:17,070
Okay.

667
00:50:17,869 --> 00:50:19,150
There's so many chairs in the fucking way.

668
00:50:19,949 --> 00:50:22,300
Did you try to push around?

669
00:50:22,300 --> 00:50:22,780
I got him.

670
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:23,900
Wait, we have sight.

671
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:25,019
Yeah, no, I got it.

672
00:50:25,019 --> 00:50:25,659
Wait, that's good.

673
00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:33,050
I think we could actually make a comeback here.

674
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:35,039
Let's hold on to it.

675
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:39,239
Oh, no, we didn't.

676
00:50:39,239 --> 00:50:40,440
We didn't hold in long enough.

677
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:41,400
Oh, I did bad.

678
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:42,360
I was very bad.

679
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:42,920
No, it's okay.

680
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:44,280
We go other side.

681
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:46,829
Thanks for the raid, Connor.

682
00:50:46,829 --> 00:50:50,190
So, you swap spawns.

683
00:50:50,190 --> 00:50:50,750
Thanks for the raid.

684
00:50:50,750 --> 00:50:51,980
Yep.

685
00:50:51,980 --> 00:50:53,099
Currently playing Call of Duty.

686
00:50:54,219 --> 00:50:55,579
I did much better last game.

687
00:50:55,579 --> 00:50:57,980
I was in like second or third place on the team last game.

688
00:50:57,980 --> 00:50:58,860
Nuketown was my map.

689
00:50:58,860 --> 00:50:59,980
Somebody's just having a fucking match here.

690
00:50:59,980 --> 00:51:00,300
Let's go.

691
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:00,699
Let's go.

692
00:51:00,699 --> 00:51:01,179
Let's go.

693
00:51:01,179 --> 00:51:01,659
Thanks for the raid.

694
00:51:01,659 --> 00:51:02,219
Welcome, everybody.

695
00:51:02,219 --> 00:51:03,900
I think all he's been, he's just been a little rat.

696
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:04,619
I'm going to hit C here.

697
00:51:05,179 --> 00:51:06,190
I'm going to go long.

698
00:51:06,829 --> 00:51:08,590
I'm going to try to play flanks like Sim did

699
00:51:08,590 --> 00:51:10,030
and try to cut him off of his bullshit.

700
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:12,800
So, I'm going to just try to hold left.

701
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:14,079
The symphony is crazy.

702
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:15,519
No, no, no, no, no.

703
00:51:15,519 --> 00:51:17,579
I'm going to fucking put an end to him.

704
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:19,099
Up the window.

705
00:51:19,099 --> 00:51:19,659
Their window.

706
00:51:19,659 --> 00:51:20,380
Their up window.

707
00:51:30,699 --> 00:51:31,260
I'm taking A.

708
00:51:32,639 --> 00:51:33,199
Yeah, do that.

709
00:51:33,199 --> 00:51:33,920
And I'm going to go for B.

710
00:51:34,719 --> 00:51:35,630
I got him.

711
00:51:36,590 --> 00:51:37,550
Nice, nice, nice.

712
00:51:37,550 --> 00:51:38,429
Got it.

713
00:51:38,429 --> 00:51:40,110
Where are they spawning?

714
00:51:40,110 --> 00:51:41,070
Oh, no, this is scary.

715
00:51:41,070 --> 00:51:42,030
Well, we're going to triple cap.

716
00:51:42,030 --> 00:51:42,829
Holy fuck.

717
00:51:42,829 --> 00:51:43,389
Let's go.

718
00:51:43,389 --> 00:51:44,190
Go, go, go, go, go.

719
00:51:44,909 --> 00:51:45,690
It's XC.

720
00:51:45,690 --> 00:51:46,329
It's XC.

721
00:51:46,329 --> 00:51:47,530
They're behind, behind, behind.

722
00:51:47,530 --> 00:51:49,289
They're near A, I think.

723
00:51:49,289 --> 00:51:50,170
What's ours?

724
00:51:50,170 --> 00:51:51,130
You got A and C.

725
00:51:51,130 --> 00:51:51,929
I'm going to see them.

726
00:51:51,929 --> 00:51:53,369
I got C, I got C, I got C, I got C.

727
00:51:53,929 --> 00:51:54,650
They're capping B as well.

728
00:51:54,650 --> 00:51:55,369
What the fuck?

729
00:51:55,369 --> 00:51:56,010
Could you get them off?

730
00:51:56,650 --> 00:51:59,119
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

731
00:51:59,119 --> 00:51:59,920
He's going back to C.

732
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:00,480
He's going back to C.

733
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:01,039
He's back on C.

734
00:52:01,039 --> 00:52:01,519
Back on C.

735
00:52:09,559 --> 00:52:10,840
Yeah, see the soul.

736
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:11,960
What the fuck, man?

737
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:15,440
I'm on B.

738
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:16,079
Oh, shit.

739
00:52:16,719 --> 00:52:17,519
I just don't know this map.

740
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:20,960
I just don't know where they're coming from.

741
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:22,000
Can they spawn behind us?

742
00:52:23,739 --> 00:52:25,019
Not when we have, like, C cap.

743
00:52:25,019 --> 00:52:26,380
They're just running here.

744
00:52:26,380 --> 00:52:28,940
Look, we just need to have people on both lanes.

745
00:52:30,139 --> 00:52:31,179
Oh, my God.

746
00:52:39,389 --> 00:52:41,550
Second floor, second floor, second floor.

747
00:52:41,550 --> 00:52:42,349
Across from theirs.

748
00:52:42,909 --> 00:52:47,690
All right.

749
00:52:47,690 --> 00:52:49,769
When you guys spawn at C, I want everyone to push out

750
00:52:49,769 --> 00:52:51,530
of the right side for this next one.

751
00:52:53,530 --> 00:53:01,199
They're inside of, like, the windows area

752
00:53:01,199 --> 00:53:04,570
with the fucking mattress going in.

753
00:53:05,130 --> 00:53:07,210
Yeah, somebody's holding in that little cubby.

754
00:53:07,530 --> 00:53:08,409
There's two people in there.

755
00:53:08,409 --> 00:53:09,769
We need to clear out that room.

756
00:53:09,769 --> 00:53:10,889
We have to clear out that room.

757
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:12,639
Oh, they're on C.

758
00:53:12,639 --> 00:53:13,039
They're on C.

759
00:53:13,039 --> 00:53:13,920
They're going to make us flip.

760
00:53:14,969 --> 00:53:15,769
Yep, they made us flip.

761
00:53:16,409 --> 00:53:17,519
I'm going to take A then.

762
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:20,639
We have B.

763
00:53:20,639 --> 00:53:21,280
I got that.

764
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:22,159
Right room is clear.

765
00:53:23,550 --> 00:53:24,269
One more in there.

766
00:53:24,269 --> 00:53:24,829
Oh, no, nice.

767
00:53:24,829 --> 00:53:25,150
Nice.

768
00:53:25,789 --> 00:53:29,469
All right, we're getting A, right?

769
00:53:29,469 --> 00:53:30,269
I'm going for A right now.

770
00:53:30,269 --> 00:53:30,670
I was.

771
00:53:30,670 --> 00:53:31,710
I almost got A.

772
00:53:32,510 --> 00:53:33,309
Two entering.

773
00:53:33,309 --> 00:53:33,710
I'm on A.

774
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:34,030
I'm on A.

775
00:53:35,039 --> 00:53:35,360
Nice.

776
00:53:36,159 --> 00:53:36,960
I don't know where anybody is.

777
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:37,440
I'm coming to help you.

778
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:38,320
I'm coming to help you.

779
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:39,519
Halfway, halfway, halfway.

780
00:53:39,519 --> 00:53:41,150
They're wrapping around the side here.

781
00:53:41,150 --> 00:53:42,219
Got it.

782
00:53:42,219 --> 00:53:42,699
Nice.

783
00:53:42,699 --> 00:53:44,760
I'm going to just help hold down B.

784
00:53:46,090 --> 00:53:46,650
Yeah, hold down B.

785
00:53:46,650 --> 00:53:47,289
Hold down B.

786
00:53:47,289 --> 00:53:48,329
I'm going to look long.

787
00:53:48,329 --> 00:53:50,429
On B, on B, on B.

788
00:53:50,429 --> 00:53:51,309
Oh, one's on B.

789
00:53:51,309 --> 00:53:51,949
On B, on B.

790
00:53:51,949 --> 00:53:52,750
There's two of them on B.

791
00:53:53,849 --> 00:53:54,650
Good shit, good shit.

792
00:53:54,650 --> 00:53:56,010
God, good shit, you know.

793
00:53:57,159 --> 00:53:57,880
Oh, God.

794
00:53:59,710 --> 00:54:00,190
Capping.

795
00:54:03,050 --> 00:54:04,090
Second floor, underside.

796
00:54:04,969 --> 00:54:05,210
No!

797
00:54:06,809 --> 00:54:07,449
Where?

798
00:54:07,449 --> 00:54:08,889
Oh, just worse.

799
00:54:08,889 --> 00:54:09,849
Oh, we got B, though.

800
00:54:09,849 --> 00:54:10,650
We got B.

801
00:54:10,650 --> 00:54:10,969
We're good.

802
00:54:10,969 --> 00:54:11,449
We got B.

803
00:54:11,449 --> 00:54:12,010
Oh, they're taking B.

804
00:54:12,010 --> 00:54:12,489
They're taking B.

805
00:54:12,489 --> 00:54:12,969
Nade, nade, nade.

806
00:54:12,969 --> 00:54:13,449
No, no, no.

807
00:54:13,449 --> 00:54:14,250
I'm here, I'm here.

808
00:54:14,250 --> 00:54:14,809
Nobody's here.

809
00:54:14,809 --> 00:54:16,730
Oh, they haven't taken A yet.

810
00:54:16,809 --> 00:54:17,769
Oh, they're on A.

811
00:54:17,769 --> 00:54:18,409
They're on A.

812
00:54:18,409 --> 00:54:19,130
They are on A.

813
00:54:20,429 --> 00:54:20,989
Okay.

814
00:54:20,989 --> 00:54:21,949
Wait, wait, no, they're not.

815
00:54:21,949 --> 00:54:22,190
Long.

816
00:54:22,190 --> 00:54:22,750
Wait, what?

817
00:54:22,750 --> 00:54:23,789
I just got something behind me.

818
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:26,360
Yeah, he's coming into B right now.

819
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:27,559
He's coming into B right now.

820
00:54:27,559 --> 00:54:29,920
We're good.

821
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:30,480
Okay.

822
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:31,449
We're clear, clear, clear.

823
00:54:31,449 --> 00:54:32,409
I just got shot at A.

824
00:54:32,409 --> 00:54:33,289
Yeah, we're good, we're good.

825
00:54:33,289 --> 00:54:34,090
Yeah, I got shot at A.

826
00:54:34,090 --> 00:54:34,650
They're taking A.

827
00:54:35,210 --> 00:54:35,530
Okay.

828
00:54:36,090 --> 00:54:38,429
Got him, got him, got him, got him.

829
00:54:41,849 --> 00:54:42,730
All right, one's inside.

830
00:54:42,730 --> 00:54:43,449
He's going to A right now.

831
00:54:43,449 --> 00:54:44,090
He's going to A.

832
00:54:44,090 --> 00:54:44,809
Oh, they're on B, man.

833
00:54:44,809 --> 00:54:45,530
Good shit, good shit, good shit.

834
00:54:46,719 --> 00:54:47,599
Anybody got a B?

835
00:54:48,159 --> 00:54:48,960
Anybody got a nade on B?

836
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:55,599
Oh, shit.

837
00:55:06,989 --> 00:55:08,349
Why did I throw the grenade?

838
00:55:08,909 --> 00:55:15,480
All right, we're going to take it back.

839
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:16,440
We're going to take it back.

840
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:22,250
Shake it, shake it, shake it.

841
00:55:22,250 --> 00:55:22,489
Go, go, go.

842
00:55:22,489 --> 00:55:24,489
Oh, behind you in the fucking window house.

843
00:55:24,489 --> 00:55:25,449
Oh, they're coming left side.

844
00:55:26,409 --> 00:55:27,289
They're in the left house.

845
00:55:29,690 --> 00:55:30,889
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

846
00:55:32,889 --> 00:55:33,289
Nice.

847
00:55:33,289 --> 00:55:34,170
They're back on though.

848
00:55:35,559 --> 00:55:36,519
We just need a nade in there.

849
00:55:36,519 --> 00:55:37,239
We just need it.

850
00:55:37,239 --> 00:55:38,360
Oh, they're taking it back.

851
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:39,480
They're taking it.

852
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:39,960
Oh, God.

853
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:40,599
They're holding long.

854
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:45,679
Shit.

855
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:48,329
They're fucking holding that shit.

856
00:55:51,869 --> 00:55:52,190
Damn it.

857
00:55:57,239 --> 00:55:58,039
I'm playing so bad.

858
00:56:00,219 --> 00:56:02,639
This dude is shot at 360.

859
00:56:02,639 --> 00:56:03,519
Don't scope right now.

860
00:56:04,079 --> 00:56:04,880
Jesus.

861
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:05,760
Oh, God.

862
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:09,179
Sorry, I had 13 kills.

863
00:56:10,199 --> 00:56:11,079
Now this series.

864
00:56:11,079 --> 00:56:11,719
Yeah.

865
00:56:11,719 --> 00:56:12,920
So they took series one.

866
00:56:15,289 --> 00:56:16,250
Oh, my God.

867
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:21,179
It's one of those maps where it's just there's so much sight

868
00:56:21,179 --> 00:56:26,860
that somebody can just be like 70 and 24 down like that.

869
00:56:26,860 --> 00:56:27,980
The right and left hallways.

870
00:56:29,150 --> 00:56:32,510
Symphony is single-handedly carrying that team.

871
00:56:32,510 --> 00:56:34,429
They're in a Jansport backpack right now.

872
00:56:34,429 --> 00:56:37,630
I think all of us literally outfrag the entire team

873
00:56:37,630 --> 00:56:38,909
if it wasn't for Symphony.

874
00:56:41,309 --> 00:56:47,480
Hey, I did all right the first game.

875
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:49,159
Second game, I just kept getting picked off.

876
00:56:50,090 --> 00:56:50,489
All good.

877
00:56:51,210 --> 00:56:53,480
All good, all good.

878
00:56:53,480 --> 00:57:10,039
I just looked like one of those people that was about to like

879
00:57:10,039 --> 00:57:13,579
you knew that I was about to hold down the voice chat

880
00:57:13,579 --> 00:57:24,730
and be like, hey, the microphone symbol

881
00:57:24,730 --> 00:57:25,929
was about to appear above my head.

882
00:57:38,039 --> 00:57:40,920
Maybe lost connection.

883
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:41,480
Good.

884
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:45,420
Holy, I need to seriously put on.

885
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:54,880
Just got banned.

886
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:55,440
No.

887
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:59,679
Wait, are you guys still on the server?

888
00:57:59,679 --> 00:58:00,559
No, I'm not.

889
00:58:00,559 --> 00:58:11,929
Oh, yeah.

890
00:58:11,929 --> 00:58:13,449
No, Call of Duty is really fun.

891
00:58:14,730 --> 00:58:17,530
I got to get like in the only way you can really play

892
00:58:17,530 --> 00:58:21,659
Call of Duty is if you just don't blink for 30 straight seconds.

893
00:58:21,659 --> 00:58:22,760
You know what I mean?

894
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:24,920
Like you have to lock in and just be like

895
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:32,409
it's the only way you can play that you don't take.

896
00:58:32,409 --> 00:58:39,960
Oh, game crashed.

897
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:44,300
Oh, hold on.

898
00:58:44,300 --> 00:58:45,019
Crash.

899
00:58:45,019 --> 00:58:48,860
But you just have to sit there and be like.

900
00:58:55,739 --> 00:58:59,789
It's like you just see like the matrix symbols.

901
00:58:59,789 --> 00:59:01,630
Okay, I'm going to open it back up.

902
00:59:01,630 --> 00:59:06,400
Yeah, the second you blink and Call of Duty

903
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:08,320
is when you're at the response screen.

904
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:14,909
Stop, you're embarrassing this community.

905
00:59:14,909 --> 00:59:15,710
Nobody can hear me.

906
00:59:15,710 --> 00:59:16,750
It's just only you can hear me.

907
00:59:16,750 --> 00:59:18,030
You're embarrassing yourself in front of you guys.

908
00:59:31,449 --> 00:59:34,880
I like popped off in that first game, though.

909
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:35,599
I did.

910
00:59:35,599 --> 00:59:37,789
I got to get that back, right?

911
00:59:37,789 --> 00:59:40,030
You got to get that Cod mindset back.

912
00:59:40,030 --> 00:59:44,219
And it's called don't fucking throw grenades

913
00:59:44,219 --> 00:59:46,460
and walk into the room, right?

914
00:59:46,460 --> 00:59:48,699
Like I've done that like three times.

915
00:59:48,699 --> 01:00:03,449
I'm going to try this weapon.

916
01:00:03,449 --> 01:00:06,730
We're back in, right?

917
01:00:06,730 --> 01:00:07,449
We're back.

918
01:00:07,449 --> 01:00:24,190
Oh, my God, I'm terrible.

919
01:00:24,190 --> 01:00:34,460
Maybe just turn my sensitivity down.

920
01:00:34,460 --> 01:01:04,829
You guys remember when I hosted the 13 and 7 kill command gameplay?

921
01:01:05,070 --> 01:01:06,750
In like 2013.

922
01:01:06,750 --> 01:01:14,670
Oh, I thought there was somebody lying there.

923
01:01:14,670 --> 01:01:15,170
Yeah.

924
01:01:16,730 --> 01:01:18,329
Yeah, I think I remember.

925
01:01:18,329 --> 01:01:18,809
Oh, shit.

926
01:01:18,809 --> 01:01:19,449
Sorry.

927
01:01:19,449 --> 01:01:20,170
I thought I was muted.

928
01:01:20,909 --> 01:01:22,190
Oh, no, no, you're fine.

929
01:01:22,190 --> 01:01:23,869
You're oh, you were talking to chat.

930
01:01:23,869 --> 01:01:24,670
I was just talking.

931
01:01:24,670 --> 01:01:26,030
Okay.

932
01:01:26,030 --> 01:01:26,829
No, that's fine.

933
01:01:26,829 --> 01:01:31,320
I was just I was like, I don't it's a long time ago.

934
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:35,369
So you play multiverses, right?

935
01:01:35,369 --> 01:01:36,010
Yeah, a little bit.

936
01:01:36,010 --> 01:01:37,289
I'm not great at it.

937
01:01:37,289 --> 01:01:38,409
What do you like the first?

938
01:01:38,969 --> 01:01:39,690
Oh, what's up?

939
01:01:39,690 --> 01:01:41,239
What do you play with?

940
01:01:41,239 --> 01:01:43,050
Oh, Shaggy.

941
01:01:43,050 --> 01:01:43,769
Kind of cool.

942
01:01:43,769 --> 01:01:45,980
It's a good pick.

943
01:01:45,980 --> 01:01:48,780
It's the only fighting game I've ever really gotten into.

944
01:01:48,780 --> 01:01:51,659
I feel like Smash was too complicated for me.

945
01:01:52,460 --> 01:01:54,539
Yeah, no, it kind of is a little too many.

946
01:01:55,420 --> 01:01:57,260
Too many particle effects, too.

947
01:01:57,260 --> 01:02:05,820
I feel like there's a steeper curve when you first learn Smash kind of thing.

948
01:02:05,820 --> 01:02:09,099
There's also like 150 characters, right?

949
01:02:09,099 --> 01:02:12,699
So yeah, learning what every single person does is kind of hard when you,

950
01:02:12,699 --> 01:02:14,539
you know, there's like 80 characters.

951
01:02:14,539 --> 01:02:31,079
There's a lot of headshots and no kills.

952
01:02:46,239 --> 01:02:47,280
Switch the gun.

953
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:48,159
Knife.

954
01:02:48,159 --> 01:02:49,119
Does this gun suck?

955
01:02:50,489 --> 01:02:51,130
Okay.

956
01:02:51,130 --> 01:02:54,889
All right.

957
01:02:54,889 --> 01:02:56,489
This is chat makes my gun.

958
01:02:57,500 --> 01:02:58,059
Okay.

959
01:02:58,059 --> 01:02:59,099
Chat makes my gun.

960
01:03:01,789 --> 01:03:02,750
You've seen how I play.

961
01:03:02,750 --> 01:03:04,190
You've seen how, what I do.

962
01:03:04,190 --> 01:03:10,000
I need you guys to, I'm going to make, I'm going to go class.

963
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:10,719
Okay.

964
01:03:10,719 --> 01:03:11,679
Please help me.

965
01:03:11,679 --> 01:03:13,599
Please.

966
01:03:13,599 --> 01:03:13,920
Okay.

967
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:14,639
We're going to go here.

968
01:03:16,599 --> 01:03:17,639
Let's just take this.

969
01:03:17,639 --> 01:03:20,570
What should I use?

970
01:03:20,570 --> 01:03:21,849
I'm seeing a lot of MP7.

971
01:03:21,849 --> 01:03:22,329
MP7.

972
01:03:22,329 --> 01:03:26,480
MP7.

973
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:27,039
MP7.

974
01:03:27,039 --> 01:03:28,880
Every time I get a knife, I think of Among Us.

975
01:03:32,119 --> 01:03:35,369
One's in the chat if I should, if MP7.

976
01:03:35,369 --> 01:03:37,610
Definitely, definitely what I think of too.

977
01:03:40,079 --> 01:03:41,360
Or MSMC.

978
01:03:41,360 --> 01:03:42,000
I'm seeing a lot.

979
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:43,739
You know, you're joking.

980
01:03:43,739 --> 01:03:45,289
MSMC.

981
01:03:45,289 --> 01:03:50,300
If it's from the back, it kind of reminds me of, yeah.

982
01:03:50,300 --> 01:03:50,780
Okay.

983
01:03:50,780 --> 01:03:52,699
I've seen a lot of, I've seen a lot of this.

984
01:03:52,699 --> 01:03:52,940
Okay.

985
01:03:52,940 --> 01:03:54,860
What attachments for the MSMC?

986
01:03:54,860 --> 01:03:56,599
Yeah, Jeremiah, you almost ready?

987
01:03:56,599 --> 01:03:58,280
Or are you doing some class stuff?

988
01:03:58,280 --> 01:03:59,000
I'm just changing class.

989
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:00,360
I'll be maybe two seconds.

990
01:04:00,360 --> 01:04:01,039
Okay.

991
01:04:01,039 --> 01:04:01,519
It's all good.

992
01:04:01,519 --> 01:04:04,639
Just whenever, just whenever it is that you're ready, join the server and I'll know.

993
01:04:04,639 --> 01:04:04,960
Yep.

994
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:05,760
To run it out.

995
01:04:07,210 --> 01:04:07,530
All right.

996
01:04:07,530 --> 01:04:08,489
Attachments.

997
01:04:08,489 --> 01:04:11,679
What am I putting on this?

998
01:04:11,679 --> 01:04:12,639
Long barrel.

999
01:04:12,639 --> 01:04:14,829
Okay.

1000
01:04:14,829 --> 01:04:22,119
And laser, laser and laser sight and long barrel.

1001
01:04:22,119 --> 01:04:30,599
What about perks?

1002
01:04:30,599 --> 01:04:31,400
Quick, hurry, hurry.

1003
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:32,199
They're waiting on you.

1004
01:04:32,199 --> 01:04:34,059
They're waiting on you.

1005
01:04:34,059 --> 01:04:36,840
Ghost.

1006
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:39,500
Lightweight.

1007
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:39,820
Okay.

1008
01:04:39,820 --> 01:04:45,559
Lightweight.

1009
01:04:45,559 --> 01:04:46,039
Toughness.

1010
01:04:49,019 --> 01:04:49,980
Scavenger.

1011
01:04:49,980 --> 01:04:51,530
Okay.

1012
01:04:51,530 --> 01:05:01,530
And hurry, hurry, hurry.

1013
01:05:01,530 --> 01:05:03,659
Tactical mask.

1014
01:05:03,659 --> 01:05:07,179
All right.

1015
01:05:07,179 --> 01:05:08,219
Tactical mask.

1016
01:05:08,219 --> 01:05:10,440
Dexterity.

1017
01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:11,239
All right.

1018
01:05:11,239 --> 01:05:11,960
And that's it, right?

1019
01:05:11,960 --> 01:05:12,440
We're done.

1020
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:12,840
We're good.

1021
01:05:12,840 --> 01:05:13,320
That's it.

1022
01:05:13,320 --> 01:05:14,750
All right.

1023
01:05:14,750 --> 01:05:15,389
We're good.

1024
01:05:15,389 --> 01:05:16,619
What's this?

1025
01:05:16,619 --> 01:05:17,179
Oops.

1026
01:05:17,179 --> 01:05:20,519
Where we going?

1027
01:05:20,519 --> 01:05:20,760
Okay.

1028
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:21,559
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

1029
01:05:21,559 --> 01:05:21,880
I'm ready.

1030
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:22,119
I'm ready.

1031
01:05:22,119 --> 01:05:22,679
I'm ready.

1032
01:05:22,679 --> 01:05:24,059
Okay.

1033
01:05:24,059 --> 01:05:24,780
Let's go.

1034
01:05:24,780 --> 01:05:28,119
All right.

1035
01:05:28,119 --> 01:05:29,000
I'm coming back in.

1036
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:33,929
Chad has a good selection for me, I guess.

1037
01:05:33,929 --> 01:05:38,699
Yeah.

1038
01:05:38,699 --> 01:05:40,539
I mostly just left mine the same.

1039
01:05:40,539 --> 01:05:48,489
This thing's a piece of dog shit.

1040
01:05:48,489 --> 01:05:51,530
Thanks, guys.

1041
01:05:51,530 --> 01:05:51,929
They made...

1042
01:05:51,929 --> 01:05:53,210
Let me change one thing.

1043
01:05:53,210 --> 01:05:54,250
What would they make you do?

1044
01:05:55,690 --> 01:05:56,409
Can you just make...

1045
01:05:56,409 --> 01:05:56,650
Okay.

1046
01:05:56,650 --> 01:05:59,289
Sakuna, they said the M...

1047
01:05:59,289 --> 01:05:59,849
What's this thing called?

1048
01:05:59,849 --> 01:06:01,130
The MSMC?

1049
01:06:02,840 --> 01:06:03,719
Yeah, that's a good gun.

1050
01:06:03,719 --> 01:06:04,199
Oh, okay.

1051
01:06:04,199 --> 01:06:05,000
That's pretty good, isn't it?

1052
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:06,730
I think.

1053
01:06:06,730 --> 01:06:09,289
With a long, long barrel and...

1054
01:06:14,110 --> 01:06:15,630
Long barrel and laser sight.

1055
01:06:15,630 --> 01:06:27,389
Laser sight.

1056
01:06:27,389 --> 01:06:29,309
No, maybe I'll try that one, too.

1057
01:06:29,309 --> 01:06:30,030
Oh, all right.

1058
01:06:30,030 --> 01:06:30,670
And it's...

1059
01:06:30,670 --> 01:06:35,630
Yeah, I mean, if Chad said it's good, it's got to be.

1060
01:06:35,630 --> 01:06:36,429
I usually trust him.

1061
01:06:36,429 --> 01:06:37,550
Chad's never wrong.

1062
01:06:37,550 --> 01:06:39,800
That's got to be.

1063
01:06:39,800 --> 01:06:40,920
I'm going to try it, too.

1064
01:06:40,920 --> 01:06:53,920
I love these stuns, man.

1065
01:06:55,559 --> 01:06:57,159
They last 10 years, I swear.

1066
01:06:58,039 --> 01:07:14,269
Team, you guys good to go?

1067
01:07:15,679 --> 01:07:16,320
Yep, I'm ready.

1068
01:07:16,320 --> 01:07:16,960
I think so, yeah.

1069
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:22,250
All right, cool.

1070
01:07:22,250 --> 01:07:23,050
Starting it up.

1071
01:07:23,050 --> 01:07:35,530
Somebody said, why are there NFP ads on my stream?

1072
01:07:35,530 --> 01:07:35,849
There aren't.

1073
01:07:35,849 --> 01:07:38,030
What are you talking about?

1074
01:07:38,030 --> 01:07:38,840
Right.

1075
01:07:38,840 --> 01:07:42,920
If we hold mid, this is the easiest fucking one of our life.

1076
01:07:43,480 --> 01:07:44,199
All right, let's go for it.

1077
01:07:44,199 --> 01:07:44,599
All right.

1078
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:46,909
Let's get it.

1079
01:07:46,909 --> 01:07:48,269
Mid control.

1080
01:07:48,269 --> 01:07:51,130
Play your life and control mid.

1081
01:07:51,130 --> 01:07:52,170
Name of the fucking game.

1082
01:07:52,170 --> 01:07:52,650
Let's get it.

1083
01:07:55,070 --> 01:07:58,360
If I die three times in a row, I'm changing back to my tried and true.

1084
01:07:58,360 --> 01:07:59,320
Yeah, same, same.

1085
01:08:01,719 --> 01:08:03,800
We're both trying the MSC thing?

1086
01:08:03,800 --> 01:08:07,070
Yeah, MSMC with long barrel and laser sight.

1087
01:08:07,070 --> 01:08:08,460
I'm doing that early.

1088
01:08:08,460 --> 01:08:09,019
That'll work.

1089
01:08:09,019 --> 01:08:10,460
84, 89?

1090
01:08:10,460 --> 01:08:11,179
94.

1091
01:08:11,179 --> 01:08:15,800
Okay, so the laser sight, I'm assuming you don't scope in anymore or...?

1092
01:08:17,840 --> 01:08:18,479
I don't know.

1093
01:08:18,479 --> 01:08:22,989
Oh, baby.

1094
01:08:23,710 --> 01:08:25,630
I want to get a fucking cross map, Nate.

1095
01:08:25,630 --> 01:08:26,670
Set us off right, you know?

1096
01:08:27,229 --> 01:08:30,829
You just throw the Tomahawk.

1097
01:08:30,829 --> 01:08:31,949
Cross map.

1098
01:08:31,949 --> 01:08:32,350
Me too.

1099
01:08:36,989 --> 01:08:38,590
Is that mid cap first?

1100
01:08:38,590 --> 01:08:42,880
I got traded.

1101
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:43,600
Holy fuck.

1102
01:08:44,159 --> 01:08:47,550
Watch that left side.

1103
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:50,279
Nated.

1104
01:08:50,279 --> 01:08:51,640
We got control left.

1105
01:08:51,640 --> 01:08:52,439
I'm going mid here.

1106
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:54,039
I just couldn't see.

1107
01:08:54,039 --> 01:08:55,560
Point in the back, point in the back, point in the back.

1108
01:09:00,140 --> 01:09:01,020
Nice.

1109
01:09:01,020 --> 01:09:02,960
I feel like we flipped spawns, right?

1110
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:03,520
Oh my god, the stuns.

1111
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:04,640
We did, we did, we did.

1112
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:05,680
The stun.

1113
01:09:05,680 --> 01:09:06,399
I'm holding mid.

1114
01:09:09,119 --> 01:09:09,600
Got one.

1115
01:09:17,949 --> 01:09:19,229
Let me know if you guys need cover right.

1116
01:09:19,229 --> 01:09:20,189
Watch out, we're on the fountain.

1117
01:09:21,149 --> 01:09:22,189
Got him, got him, got him.

1118
01:09:22,189 --> 01:09:22,829
Good, good, good.

1119
01:09:23,390 --> 01:09:24,270
I think we flipped again.

1120
01:09:24,989 --> 01:09:31,880
Symphony, suck my dick, bitch.

1121
01:09:32,760 --> 01:09:33,239
All day.

1122
01:09:35,159 --> 01:09:36,359
On these fucking nuts.

1123
01:09:36,359 --> 01:09:37,720
Where's the ammo in...

1124
01:09:37,720 --> 01:09:38,760
I sound like a baby.

1125
01:09:39,560 --> 01:09:40,119
I spawn on new...

1126
01:09:42,159 --> 01:09:43,680
Mommy, where's my ammo?

1127
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:44,479
Where's the ammo?

1128
01:09:44,479 --> 01:09:46,239
He's pulling it back out of the fountain.

1129
01:09:46,239 --> 01:09:48,779
I'm on point, I'm on point, point, flip, point, flip.

1130
01:09:48,779 --> 01:09:50,060
I got you, I got you, I got you, I got you.

1131
01:09:50,060 --> 01:09:55,210
He's gonna be left side.

1132
01:09:55,210 --> 01:09:56,489
This is good for us right here.

1133
01:09:58,029 --> 01:09:59,310
Stuck this dick, Simp!

1134
01:10:00,029 --> 01:10:02,619
Hold that fountain.

1135
01:10:03,340 --> 01:10:06,720
I got you, I got, I got, I got point, I got point.

1136
01:10:06,720 --> 01:10:07,199
All day.

1137
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:12,859
Hold that concussion, bitch.

1138
01:10:13,500 --> 01:10:16,800
Behind, behind, behind, behind.

1139
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:17,979
Behind point.

1140
01:10:17,979 --> 01:10:18,619
Oh, are they moving?

1141
01:10:19,659 --> 01:10:22,970
Fuck, they got point.

1142
01:10:22,970 --> 01:10:24,970
Up 40, let's take that shit back.

1143
01:10:24,970 --> 01:10:26,800
I'm down to take it from street.

1144
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:28,079
The left side with Shikuno.

1145
01:10:28,079 --> 01:10:29,119
I'm with you, Syke.

1146
01:10:29,119 --> 01:10:29,949
Yeah, I don't see it.

1147
01:10:29,949 --> 01:10:31,069
All right, I hear somebody over here.

1148
01:10:31,069 --> 01:10:37,149
Oh, that's two.

1149
01:10:37,710 --> 01:10:39,310
Jesus, Symphony's crazy, man.

1150
01:10:39,310 --> 01:10:40,270
Point flip, point flip.

1151
01:10:40,270 --> 01:10:41,229
Oh, right here, right here, right here.

1152
01:10:43,390 --> 01:10:44,270
I got him on a leash, Syke.

1153
01:10:44,270 --> 01:10:45,229
I got him on a leash.

1154
01:10:45,229 --> 01:10:46,409
I'm behind.

1155
01:10:46,409 --> 01:10:46,810
Got one.

1156
01:10:49,210 --> 01:10:50,170
I got two in that room.

1157
01:10:50,170 --> 01:10:50,649
Good trades.

1158
01:10:50,649 --> 01:10:51,210
Nice, nice.

1159
01:10:51,210 --> 01:10:52,090
I just watched you do that.

1160
01:10:52,090 --> 01:10:54,989
I'm coming to help point.

1161
01:10:54,989 --> 01:10:56,109
Oh, he's on point.

1162
01:10:56,109 --> 01:10:56,909
I can cuss one.

1163
01:10:56,909 --> 01:10:57,710
Behind the truck.

1164
01:10:59,739 --> 01:11:00,380
Behind, behind, behind.

1165
01:11:01,529 --> 01:11:03,289
Oh, yep, it's Sim right there.

1166
01:11:07,069 --> 01:11:08,189
Nading site.

1167
01:11:08,189 --> 01:11:10,750
Let's wait till we all respawn and make a push together.

1168
01:11:10,750 --> 01:11:12,569
All right, let's do this.

1169
01:11:12,569 --> 01:11:13,130
We're grouped.

1170
01:11:13,689 --> 01:11:15,449
Got one, I got Sim.

1171
01:11:15,449 --> 01:11:16,329
Good shit, let's go.

1172
01:11:18,649 --> 01:11:20,810
One back, three back in the right side spawn.

1173
01:11:20,810 --> 01:11:22,569
Oh, I got hit right in the fucking head.

1174
01:11:22,569 --> 01:11:23,130
Why what?

1175
01:11:23,130 --> 01:11:25,609
Oh, no, Blau just teared us apart.

1176
01:11:26,489 --> 01:11:28,569
Hardpoint switch and going offline in 10.

1177
01:11:28,569 --> 01:11:30,170
We play for the next one, which I think is mid.

1178
01:11:30,569 --> 01:11:32,840
So let's just get mid control right now.

1179
01:11:32,840 --> 01:11:33,880
Fuck this next point.

1180
01:11:33,880 --> 01:11:37,600
Or fuck the point that's currently up.

1181
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:39,470
I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on it.

1182
01:11:39,470 --> 01:11:40,750
Mechanical damage, I'm dead.

1183
01:11:42,170 --> 01:11:43,770
All right, rolling with you.

1184
01:11:43,770 --> 01:11:47,760
I see where they're rotating from.

1185
01:11:48,720 --> 01:11:50,590
Oh, I need to switch gun here.

1186
01:11:51,149 --> 01:11:59,149
Let's go, Dean, I'm on you.

1187
01:11:59,149 --> 01:11:59,949
I'm with you, I'm with you.

1188
01:11:59,949 --> 01:12:00,670
Yeah, I got you, I got you.

1189
01:12:00,670 --> 01:12:01,710
I'm on nade in the side.

1190
01:12:01,710 --> 01:12:02,670
Together, bro.

1191
01:12:02,670 --> 01:12:04,109
Oh, my God, was he in that room?

1192
01:12:04,109 --> 01:12:04,670
Oh, nade inside, though.

1193
01:12:04,670 --> 01:12:05,390
Oh, he was holding that.

1194
01:12:05,390 --> 01:12:05,869
He's in the back.

1195
01:12:05,869 --> 01:12:07,069
He's in the back alley, back alley, back alley.

1196
01:12:07,069 --> 01:12:07,569
Got one.

1197
01:12:08,430 --> 01:12:08,909
Okay.

1198
01:12:08,909 --> 01:12:10,189
Oh, God, the stuns.

1199
01:12:10,829 --> 01:12:11,310
I'm going.

1200
01:12:11,390 --> 01:12:12,189
Oh, shit.

1201
01:12:13,689 --> 01:12:14,729
What the fuck?

1202
01:12:14,729 --> 01:12:15,449
Where did he come from?

1203
01:12:15,449 --> 01:12:17,609
One coming in.

1204
01:12:17,609 --> 01:12:18,010
Nice.

1205
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:19,920
P.O.P.

1206
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:20,720
Let's hold this shit down.

1207
01:12:22,829 --> 01:12:23,329
Yeah.

1208
01:12:24,189 --> 01:12:25,229
I'll watch the back side.

1209
01:12:27,229 --> 01:12:27,729
Got one.

1210
01:12:29,069 --> 01:12:30,109
He went back alley, back alley.

1211
01:12:30,109 --> 01:12:30,750
Symphony went back.

1212
01:12:30,750 --> 01:12:31,470
There it goes.

1213
01:12:31,470 --> 01:12:31,970
Roger.

1214
01:12:33,869 --> 01:12:36,430
Oops.

1215
01:12:36,430 --> 01:12:37,310
I got blah on it.

1216
01:12:38,189 --> 01:12:38,510
Nice.

1217
01:12:38,510 --> 01:12:39,149
We're up, baby.

1218
01:12:39,149 --> 01:12:39,550
We're up.

1219
01:12:40,430 --> 01:12:41,630
All right, we got to take over mid again.

1220
01:12:42,510 --> 01:12:42,989
Back left.

1221
01:12:42,989 --> 01:12:43,489
Oh, God.

1222
01:12:43,949 --> 01:12:48,520
Okay, I'm going to push out mid here.

1223
01:12:50,250 --> 01:12:53,579
Yikes.

1224
01:12:53,979 --> 01:12:58,649
John, your fucking knife, man.

1225
01:12:58,649 --> 01:12:59,130
I'm nading.

1226
01:12:59,130 --> 01:13:00,409
They're like, I'm sorry.

1227
01:13:00,409 --> 01:13:00,970
I just ruined you.

1228
01:13:00,970 --> 01:13:01,289
Sorry.

1229
01:13:01,289 --> 01:13:02,010
No, it's okay.

1230
01:13:04,319 --> 01:13:05,439
God damn it.

1231
01:13:05,439 --> 01:13:06,399
I'm being so careful.

1232
01:13:06,399 --> 01:13:08,079
And all of a sudden, I get instantly killed.

1233
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:10,560
Got another.

1234
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:11,039
He's back.

1235
01:13:11,039 --> 01:13:11,359
It's clear.

1236
01:13:13,039 --> 01:13:13,520
Got another.

1237
01:13:13,520 --> 01:13:14,239
One more, one more.

1238
01:13:14,239 --> 01:13:15,760
On side, on side, on side with us.

1239
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:16,880
I cleared, I cleared, I cleared.

1240
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:18,000
All right, good, good, good.

1241
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:18,960
Coming left, left side.

1242
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:21,520
Oh, no, I'm stunned, I'm stunned.

1243
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:22,350
It's all right.

1244
01:13:22,350 --> 01:13:23,069
We got points still.

1245
01:13:23,710 --> 01:13:25,229
They're just mad stunning that bitch right now.

1246
01:13:25,229 --> 01:13:26,189
We just get off for a second.

1247
01:13:27,439 --> 01:13:27,939
Got one.

1248
01:13:29,100 --> 01:13:30,380
Got another, switching guns.

1249
01:13:30,380 --> 01:13:30,880
Fuck me.

1250
01:13:32,909 --> 01:13:33,409
I'm nading.

1251
01:13:34,409 --> 01:13:39,020
Back on point, baby.

1252
01:13:39,020 --> 01:13:39,659
In that house.

1253
01:13:39,659 --> 01:13:43,369
Oh, I just got murdered.

1254
01:13:43,369 --> 01:13:44,649
We're still in the lead.

1255
01:13:44,649 --> 01:13:47,210
We're good.

1256
01:13:47,210 --> 01:13:47,689
Pushing out.

1257
01:13:47,689 --> 01:13:50,350
All right, we need, we need to, yeah.

1258
01:13:50,350 --> 01:13:52,109
Fuck, I got, I got demolished.

1259
01:13:52,829 --> 01:13:54,989
Oh, it's Anthony who's holding that door.

1260
01:13:57,439 --> 01:13:58,479
I'm rocking with you, Sakuna.

1261
01:13:58,479 --> 01:14:00,000
Let's do what we did last time on the streets.

1262
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,619
Anthony's holding right if we're pushing towards it.

1263
01:14:02,619 --> 01:14:03,899
Yeah, yeah, let's go left then.

1264
01:14:03,899 --> 01:14:08,189
Blasted, Mike.

1265
01:14:08,189 --> 01:14:09,149
Wow, holy shit.

1266
01:14:09,869 --> 01:14:12,670
He's holding this door outside of the market.

1267
01:14:12,670 --> 01:14:13,390
Electronic shop.

1268
01:14:17,470 --> 01:14:19,149
Oh, got a hit with that stun.

1269
01:14:19,149 --> 01:14:20,189
Got a hit with that stun.

1270
01:14:21,390 --> 01:14:24,909
Oh, oh, oh, they're very, they're very concussed.

1271
01:14:24,909 --> 01:14:27,199
Nice, nice.

1272
01:14:37,050 --> 01:14:38,729
All right, next point going up.

1273
01:14:38,729 --> 01:14:39,850
Should be what?

1274
01:14:39,850 --> 01:14:41,369
Electro right here, right?

1275
01:14:41,369 --> 01:14:42,569
Oh, yeah, back here.

1276
01:14:45,470 --> 01:14:46,270
Stem is on it.

1277
01:14:51,340 --> 01:14:59,149
Oh, bro, where are my bullets going?

1278
01:14:59,149 --> 01:14:59,630
Where?

1279
01:14:59,630 --> 01:15:02,029
Oh, why did my gun switch?

1280
01:15:02,029 --> 01:15:06,619
I got, I got blowing on site.

1281
01:15:06,619 --> 01:15:08,479
Okay.

1282
01:15:08,479 --> 01:15:11,119
Oh, God, there's somebody holding it back with a knife.

1283
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:12,319
All right.

1284
01:15:14,460 --> 01:15:16,600
One got stun, one got nade.

1285
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:20,409
Swinging, reloading.

1286
01:15:20,409 --> 01:15:20,810
What?

1287
01:15:20,810 --> 01:15:22,409
Reloading, and then I'm going to, I'm pushing into site after this.

1288
01:15:22,409 --> 01:15:23,210
I got him, I got him, I got him.

1289
01:15:23,210 --> 01:15:24,090
Let's go, Dean, let's go, Dean.

1290
01:15:24,090 --> 01:15:24,729
This is it.

1291
01:15:24,729 --> 01:15:25,930
We got you, Dean.

1292
01:15:25,930 --> 01:15:29,239
We got a fucking knife, man.

1293
01:15:29,239 --> 01:15:32,439
Oh, this fucker John is playing like a rat.

1294
01:15:32,439 --> 01:15:35,930
All right, next point coming up.

1295
01:15:36,569 --> 01:15:38,649
Oh, God, I just got lased.

1296
01:15:38,649 --> 01:15:42,640
It should be mechanic shop on the left side of the, yeah.

1297
01:15:44,090 --> 01:15:46,680
God!

1298
01:15:46,680 --> 01:15:47,560
Watch out behind us.

1299
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:52,239
I'm never inviting another fucking OTB member to this.

1300
01:15:52,239 --> 01:15:54,399
So the fucking, this is mad shit ever again.

1301
01:15:54,399 --> 01:15:56,000
Oh, my God.

1302
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,159
Going through the fucking content knives, dude.

1303
01:15:58,159 --> 01:15:58,720
Fuck off.

1304
01:16:01,199 --> 01:16:01,920
I don't care.

1305
01:16:01,920 --> 01:16:02,800
I don't give a fuck.

1306
01:16:07,159 --> 01:16:08,600
I couldn't even see where I was.

1307
01:16:08,600 --> 01:16:09,800
All the way in the back.

1308
01:16:09,800 --> 01:16:11,000
I got sim, I got sim.

1309
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:11,960
It's fucking free.

1310
01:16:14,859 --> 01:16:15,420
Go in.

1311
01:16:15,420 --> 01:16:16,220
I don't know.

1312
01:16:16,220 --> 01:16:17,340
Go in, you dumb bitch.

1313
01:16:17,899 --> 01:16:19,260
You fat ass character model.

1314
01:16:19,260 --> 01:16:20,140
Oh, my God.

1315
01:16:22,699 --> 01:16:24,619
Why can I go in there?

1316
01:16:24,619 --> 01:16:25,659
It should be mid.

1317
01:16:25,659 --> 01:16:26,779
Stop feeding.

1318
01:16:26,779 --> 01:16:27,500
I can't help it.

1319
01:16:27,500 --> 01:16:29,819
You just ran out, jumped, sprayed in.

1320
01:16:31,949 --> 01:16:32,909
Come on.

1321
01:16:33,789 --> 01:16:38,750
So remember, this mode, it has no time limit.

1322
01:16:38,750 --> 01:16:39,789
So we can still come back.

1323
01:16:42,489 --> 01:16:43,130
Oh, fuck.

1324
01:16:43,130 --> 01:16:43,850
Okay, next point.

1325
01:16:43,850 --> 01:16:44,329
It's mid.

1326
01:16:44,329 --> 01:16:44,829
Where?

1327
01:16:45,289 --> 01:16:46,250
Mid, mid, mid, mid, mid.

1328
01:16:46,970 --> 01:16:48,329
How did I not see him?

1329
01:16:48,329 --> 01:16:51,689
I've got metal gear solid NPC vision apparently in this game.

1330
01:16:51,689 --> 01:16:53,289
Oh, sim is going in the middle right now.

1331
01:16:53,930 --> 01:16:55,130
I'm holding right.

1332
01:16:55,130 --> 01:16:55,529
Oh, God.

1333
01:16:55,529 --> 01:16:56,170
He's very nice.

1334
01:16:56,170 --> 01:16:56,670
Nice.

1335
01:16:57,289 --> 01:16:58,250
Don't somebody's next to me.

1336
01:16:58,250 --> 01:16:58,750
Oh, God.

1337
01:16:59,550 --> 01:17:00,430
All right, I got you with defense.

1338
01:17:00,430 --> 01:17:00,989
I got you with defense.

1339
01:17:00,989 --> 01:17:01,630
I got you with defense.

1340
01:17:01,630 --> 01:17:02,430
Oh, God, I'm so stunned.

1341
01:17:02,430 --> 01:17:03,069
I'm so stunned.

1342
01:17:03,069 --> 01:17:04,829
No, no, no, I got you, I got you, I got you.

1343
01:17:04,829 --> 01:17:05,550
I got you, baby.

1344
01:17:05,550 --> 01:17:06,590
He's on the other side, other side.

1345
01:17:08,510 --> 01:17:09,390
What the fuck?

1346
01:17:10,189 --> 01:17:10,750
He's on top.

1347
01:17:11,390 --> 01:17:12,029
We fucking got this.

1348
01:17:12,029 --> 01:17:12,750
Another one, another one.

1349
01:17:12,750 --> 01:17:13,149
Oh, my God.

1350
01:17:13,149 --> 01:17:14,350
There's another one prone.

1351
01:17:14,350 --> 01:17:15,260
It's okay.

1352
01:17:15,260 --> 01:17:15,739
We got this.

1353
01:17:15,739 --> 01:17:16,699
Our point, our point.

1354
01:17:17,869 --> 01:17:18,369
Yay.

1355
01:17:21,069 --> 01:17:21,569
Oops.

1356
01:17:27,810 --> 01:17:29,489
Oh, nice, nice, nice.

1357
01:17:29,489 --> 01:17:29,989
Nice.

1358
01:17:30,850 --> 01:17:31,649
All right, all right.

1359
01:17:31,649 --> 01:17:32,930
Keep it, keep it, keep it, keep it.

1360
01:17:32,930 --> 01:17:33,250
Next one.

1361
01:17:33,250 --> 01:17:33,729
Yeah.

1362
01:17:33,729 --> 01:17:34,609
Yeah, next one comes up.

1363
01:17:34,609 --> 01:17:35,970
We got to start defending for next one.

1364
01:17:36,449 --> 01:17:39,420
I'm going for the next one right now, I think.

1365
01:17:40,060 --> 01:17:41,899
Yeah, they're already rotating toward it.

1366
01:17:41,899 --> 01:17:43,020
Oh, my gosh.

1367
01:17:43,020 --> 01:17:43,819
You sent me to the back, right?

1368
01:17:43,819 --> 01:17:44,300
You sent me to the back.

1369
01:17:44,300 --> 01:17:44,619
I got it.

1370
01:17:44,619 --> 01:17:44,939
I got it.

1371
01:17:44,939 --> 01:17:47,729
Yeah, I got it.

1372
01:17:48,689 --> 01:17:49,569
Oh, fuck.

1373
01:17:50,529 --> 01:17:51,409
They don't have stairs yet.

1374
01:17:51,409 --> 01:17:52,369
They don't have stairs yet.

1375
01:17:53,010 --> 01:17:55,409
Oh, no, there's somebody behind me.

1376
01:17:55,409 --> 01:17:55,909
Running.

1377
01:17:58,529 --> 01:17:59,170
I'm busting through.

1378
01:17:59,170 --> 01:18:00,289
I'm busting through.

1379
01:18:00,289 --> 01:18:03,649
No, oh, dude.

1380
01:18:03,649 --> 01:18:06,289
Oh, my God.

1381
01:18:06,289 --> 01:18:08,449
I feel like it's so much closer than it is.

1382
01:18:09,409 --> 01:18:11,460
I just died so fast.

1383
01:18:11,460 --> 01:18:12,420
It felt like it was pretty close.

1384
01:18:12,420 --> 01:18:13,939
It was the jammed support backpack of Symphony, man.

1385
01:18:14,579 --> 01:18:15,699
Nah, but like.

1386
01:18:15,699 --> 01:18:16,500
No, it is.

1387
01:18:16,500 --> 01:18:19,539
Bro, brother, look at the kills.

1388
01:18:20,659 --> 01:18:21,859
Yeah, but I'm right there.

1389
01:18:21,859 --> 01:18:22,500
I'm toe to toe.

1390
01:18:23,710 --> 01:18:25,470
We got more kills than them total, I think, bro.

1391
01:18:27,090 --> 01:18:28,930
They're fucking nice on objective play right now.

1392
01:18:29,489 --> 01:18:29,890
Legit.

1393
01:18:29,890 --> 01:18:31,729
I think we're actually, we have more kills total.

1394
01:18:32,369 --> 01:18:33,569
Oh, yeah, you're right, you're right.

1395
01:18:36,079 --> 01:18:37,649
Next one, SMD.

1396
01:18:37,649 --> 01:18:38,770
It was a good round.

1397
01:18:38,770 --> 01:18:40,369
That's what I'm saying.

1398
01:18:40,369 --> 01:18:41,409
We're out fragging them.

1399
01:18:41,409 --> 01:18:42,210
It's Symphony.

1400
01:18:43,380 --> 01:18:44,180
Hard carry.

1401
01:18:45,489 --> 01:18:46,909
Unbelievable.

1402
01:18:46,909 --> 01:18:49,789
I'm going to have Brooke like unplug the internet real quick.

1403
01:18:51,390 --> 01:18:56,350
Have Symphony route through the VPN to like around like a circle around the globe

1404
01:18:56,350 --> 01:18:59,739
and then hit back to here.

1405
01:18:59,739 --> 01:19:01,100
Give Symphony like 400 ping.

1406
01:19:01,100 --> 01:19:06,979
One, two, one, two, four, five, one, two, three, four.

1407
01:19:06,979 --> 01:19:08,180
So much change in their class.

1408
01:19:08,180 --> 01:19:09,060
I'm going to go yell at them.

1409
01:19:09,060 --> 01:19:10,739
Feel free to come with me and talk shit.

1410
01:19:10,739 --> 01:19:19,420
What's next, anyway?

1411
01:19:19,420 --> 01:19:20,800
Hold on.

1412
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:21,680
What's up?

1413
01:19:21,680 --> 01:19:23,119
I'm just adjusting.

1414
01:19:23,119 --> 01:19:23,600
What's up?

1415
01:19:24,239 --> 01:19:25,439
I'm just adjusting stuff.

1416
01:19:26,159 --> 01:19:27,439
Chats, chats, metagaming for me.

1417
01:19:27,439 --> 01:19:28,000
Did you call me?

1418
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:29,680
Yeah, I called you.

1419
01:19:29,680 --> 01:19:30,720
What the fuck?

1420
01:19:30,720 --> 01:19:31,199
Hi, coach.

1421
01:19:31,199 --> 01:19:32,720
How's it going?

1422
01:19:32,720 --> 01:19:33,840
It's going awful.

1423
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:34,560
I don't like you.

1424
01:19:35,119 --> 01:19:35,439
What's up?

1425
01:19:35,439 --> 01:19:36,159
It's going great.

1426
01:19:36,159 --> 01:19:37,039
Master Yoshi.

1427
01:19:37,039 --> 01:19:38,319
I do not like you.

1428
01:19:38,319 --> 01:19:39,279
What did I do?

1429
01:19:40,399 --> 01:19:41,119
What did I do?

1430
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:42,399
What the fuck?

1431
01:19:42,399 --> 01:19:45,920
You fucking, you got your little knife hiding in a little fucking corner.

1432
01:19:46,720 --> 01:19:48,800
Dad, you don't like my jet belt?

1433
01:19:48,800 --> 01:19:49,520
He's a gentleman.

1434
01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:50,239
What do you feel strong?

1435
01:19:50,239 --> 01:19:52,880
Are you low playing as jet and call of duty?

1436
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:54,239
What the fuck?

1437
01:19:54,239 --> 01:19:57,119
And then I'm double smoking site and then I flash it and then I go in.

1438
01:20:00,699 --> 01:20:02,479
I'm gonna blow up my house.

1439
01:20:02,479 --> 01:20:03,600
I can't escape the Valor, man.

1440
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:04,399
I have an itch.

1441
01:20:04,399 --> 01:20:05,439
Okay, it's not my fault.

1442
01:20:05,439 --> 01:20:06,239
What the fuck?

1443
01:20:08,140 --> 01:20:08,779
It's a problem.

1444
01:20:08,779 --> 01:20:09,100
I know.

1445
01:20:09,100 --> 01:20:13,010
I'm aware of it.

1446
01:20:13,010 --> 01:20:13,329
Jet.

1447
01:20:14,859 --> 01:20:15,739
Hey, Sim.

1448
01:20:15,739 --> 01:20:16,460
What's up, buddy?

1449
01:20:17,180 --> 01:20:17,819
Yeah, you like that?

1450
01:20:17,819 --> 01:20:19,260
You like that map a little bit more?

1451
01:20:19,260 --> 01:20:21,340
Yeah, I started calling out, bro.

1452
01:20:21,340 --> 01:20:22,380
You should have heard my comms.

1453
01:20:22,380 --> 01:20:23,100
Oh, crap.

1454
01:20:23,100 --> 01:20:24,140
No shot, man.

1455
01:20:24,779 --> 01:20:27,899
It looks like I so badly want to participate in like the trash talk,

1456
01:20:27,899 --> 01:20:29,819
but I just like don't know how.

1457
01:20:29,819 --> 01:20:34,529
And I just I just want to be heard on everybody else's stream.

1458
01:20:34,529 --> 01:20:35,649
You know what I mean?

1459
01:20:35,649 --> 01:20:36,850
Like, what the fuck?

1460
01:20:36,850 --> 01:20:37,970
It's me, Jerma talking by the way.

1461
01:20:37,970 --> 01:20:39,329
It's Jerma985 talking.

1462
01:20:39,329 --> 01:20:41,899
I just like so badly want to be on other people's streams.

1463
01:20:41,899 --> 01:20:42,859
That's like what I'm doing.

1464
01:20:43,420 --> 01:20:44,220
That's what that is.

1465
01:20:45,729 --> 01:20:49,539
I just like want to be heard on that stream.

1466
01:20:49,539 --> 01:20:50,020
All right.

1467
01:20:50,020 --> 01:20:51,460
I'm going to get 20 kills next game.

1468
01:20:52,020 --> 01:20:53,140
Just you watch.

1469
01:20:53,140 --> 01:20:53,779
Just you watch.

1470
01:20:56,369 --> 01:20:59,439
No, GG though.

1471
01:20:59,439 --> 01:21:03,420
GG indeed.

1472
01:21:03,420 --> 01:21:03,979
Next game.

1473
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:13,380
Oh, I think we're going to do.

1474
01:21:14,180 --> 01:21:15,699
We're going to do SND next map.

1475
01:21:17,420 --> 01:21:18,460
That'll be interesting.

1476
01:21:18,460 --> 01:21:19,579
That'll be really interesting.

1477
01:21:19,579 --> 01:21:21,260
Yeah, I think SND will be a lot of fun.

1478
01:21:21,260 --> 01:21:24,699
Let's do this.

1479
01:21:26,369 --> 01:21:27,170
Fuck.

1480
01:21:27,170 --> 01:21:28,659
By the way.

1481
01:21:28,659 --> 01:21:30,020
I'm pressed after that last one.

1482
01:21:30,020 --> 01:21:30,899
I'm not even going to front.

1483
01:21:30,899 --> 01:21:31,859
For those who don't know.

1484
01:21:34,819 --> 01:21:35,779
For those that don't know.

1485
01:21:35,779 --> 01:21:37,699
Honestly, you guys had a good lead for a minute.

1486
01:21:37,699 --> 01:21:38,500
I was like, oh, fuck.

1487
01:21:38,500 --> 01:21:39,220
I'm the sus guy.

1488
01:21:41,220 --> 01:21:42,100
For those who don't know.

1489
01:21:43,539 --> 01:21:44,420
I'm the sus guy.

1490
01:21:46,130 --> 01:21:47,250
I'm fucking muted, guys.

1491
01:21:47,250 --> 01:21:48,689
Relax as a joke.

1492
01:21:48,689 --> 01:22:01,920
I didn't do that.

1493
01:22:01,920 --> 01:22:03,520
I've been muted almost the whole time.

1494
01:22:03,520 --> 01:22:04,159
Don't you get it?

1495
01:22:07,140 --> 01:22:08,020
I would never do that.

1496
01:22:08,020 --> 01:22:15,060
That's so stupid and embarrassing.

1497
01:22:15,060 --> 01:22:18,000
Why would I ever do that?

1498
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,960
I honestly, I'm going to sound like a fucking weirdo.

1499
01:22:20,960 --> 01:22:22,880
I wouldn't do that for 10 grand.

1500
01:22:22,880 --> 01:22:25,890
I don't think so.

1501
01:22:25,890 --> 01:22:28,289
If it was like, hey, dude, I'll give you $10,000.

1502
01:22:28,289 --> 01:22:30,289
If you announced to all these streamers that,

1503
01:22:30,289 --> 01:22:32,369
hey, just in case you guys want to know.

1504
01:22:32,369 --> 01:22:33,329
I'm the sus guy.

1505
01:22:33,329 --> 01:22:34,930
And like, don't make it a joke.

1506
01:22:34,930 --> 01:22:36,369
I wouldn't do that for 10 grand.

1507
01:22:36,369 --> 01:22:37,489
I wouldn't do it.

1508
01:22:37,489 --> 01:22:39,390
Or I might.

1509
01:22:39,390 --> 01:22:40,430
All right, we're going to run it up.

1510
01:22:45,140 --> 01:22:47,060
Next one is SND, by the way.

1511
01:22:47,060 --> 01:22:54,779
God.

1512
01:22:54,779 --> 01:22:56,939
Can I change my my loadout really quick?

1513
01:22:57,899 --> 01:22:58,539
Hold up.

1514
01:22:58,539 --> 01:22:59,420
Do it for free.

1515
01:23:00,220 --> 01:23:02,720
I thought this was Michael Myers.

1516
01:23:02,720 --> 01:23:04,500
I thought that was Michael Myers.

1517
01:23:04,500 --> 01:23:06,100
I was like, what the fuck is that?

1518
01:23:06,100 --> 01:23:11,840
I don't know.

1519
01:23:11,840 --> 01:23:14,000
But the more that I think about it,

1520
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:15,920
would I want to make all these other streamers think

1521
01:23:15,920 --> 01:23:19,300
that I was like this fucking nerd?

1522
01:23:19,300 --> 01:23:21,220
Like trying to be wicked funny.

1523
01:23:21,220 --> 01:23:22,420
Like, shut up.

1524
01:23:22,420 --> 01:23:23,060
Shut up, dude.

1525
01:23:23,060 --> 01:23:24,020
Get out of the lobby.

1526
01:23:24,020 --> 01:23:25,460
Fucking get out of here.

1527
01:23:25,460 --> 01:23:26,420
I think I'm ready.

1528
01:23:26,420 --> 01:23:39,789
Yeah, I think I'm good to go.

1529
01:23:40,510 --> 01:23:42,829
You guys want to want to make it crazy.

1530
01:23:42,829 --> 01:23:44,109
So this is search and destroyer?

1531
01:23:44,109 --> 01:23:46,260
Yes.

1532
01:23:46,819 --> 01:23:47,380
Yes.

1533
01:23:47,380 --> 01:23:50,300
And then so we're just doing something with the class

1534
01:23:50,300 --> 01:23:53,090
and then we're running it.

1535
01:23:53,090 --> 01:23:53,649
I'm done.

1536
01:23:53,649 --> 01:23:54,210
I'm ready.

1537
01:23:54,210 --> 01:23:56,909
Oh, I'm going to use the weapon I had before.

1538
01:23:56,909 --> 01:23:58,109
I feel like I was better with it.

1539
01:23:58,109 --> 01:23:59,890
It's going to be same.

1540
01:23:59,890 --> 01:24:01,420
Same.

1541
01:24:01,420 --> 01:24:02,380
I want to be honest.

1542
01:24:02,380 --> 01:24:05,899
I switched to the same gun that Symphony uses

1543
01:24:05,899 --> 01:24:08,779
in hopes of being almost as good as he is.

1544
01:24:10,859 --> 01:24:12,699
Oh, I hope it works really good.

1545
01:24:12,699 --> 01:24:13,420
I'm using it.

1546
01:24:13,420 --> 01:24:13,739
Yeah.

1547
01:24:13,739 --> 01:24:17,329
Yeah, that's what it seems like.

1548
01:24:17,329 --> 01:24:19,970
Guys, what SND maps are new Plaza or Raid?

1549
01:24:21,279 --> 01:24:21,779
Raid.

1550
01:24:25,619 --> 01:24:26,100
I don't know.

1551
01:24:26,659 --> 01:24:28,979
I was just good, but it's just really it's just really big.

1552
01:24:28,979 --> 01:24:29,460
Raids.

1553
01:24:29,460 --> 01:24:30,100
Raids a throwback.

1554
01:24:30,100 --> 01:24:30,739
Raids the throwback.

1555
01:24:30,739 --> 01:24:31,619
Raid is a throwback.

1556
01:24:31,619 --> 01:24:31,939
Let's see.

1557
01:24:31,939 --> 01:24:32,659
Raid SND.

1558
01:24:34,239 --> 01:24:34,560
All right.

1559
01:24:34,560 --> 01:24:36,079
Stuns got me moving in slow motion.

1560
01:24:40,960 --> 01:24:43,739
Got him.

1561
01:24:43,739 --> 01:24:45,100
I feel like we're going to win this one.

1562
01:24:47,279 --> 01:24:48,960
Yeah, surely we'll win this.

1563
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:49,460
Surely.

1564
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:55,180
For all I think we're not putting up a bad fight.

1565
01:24:55,180 --> 01:24:55,899
No, I don't think so.

1566
01:24:55,899 --> 01:24:57,340
Yeah, we can't win it.

1567
01:24:57,340 --> 01:24:58,380
This game is fun.

1568
01:24:58,460 --> 01:24:59,020
It really is.

1569
01:25:00,220 --> 01:25:02,380
It's just so hectic and fasted.

1570
01:25:03,420 --> 01:25:08,479
Oh, here we go.

1571
01:25:08,479 --> 01:25:13,279
So is this a big map like long range or short range?

1572
01:25:13,279 --> 01:25:13,840
Long range.

1573
01:25:15,939 --> 01:25:24,739
Now that I copied Symphony's gun, surely I'll be half as good.

1574
01:25:24,739 --> 01:25:26,659
So is this it?

1575
01:25:26,659 --> 01:25:27,380
They're going to fix it.

1576
01:25:27,380 --> 01:25:27,859
Oh, okay.

1577
01:25:27,859 --> 01:25:28,659
Yeah, they're going to fix it.

1578
01:25:28,659 --> 01:25:28,819
Yeah.

1579
01:25:28,819 --> 01:25:29,380
Am I bugged?

1580
01:25:30,640 --> 01:25:31,840
My scope doesn't work.

1581
01:25:31,840 --> 01:25:35,439
Oh, yeah, because everyone's lagged.

1582
01:25:35,439 --> 01:25:37,600
Like definitely having some kind of sites.

1583
01:25:54,029 --> 01:26:02,689
Say la la into the lobby.

1584
01:26:02,689 --> 01:26:06,689
I wouldn't do that 10 grand.

1585
01:26:06,689 --> 01:26:19,600
No, is it up yet or is just me?

1586
01:26:21,069 --> 01:26:21,869
No, it's not up yet.

1587
01:26:21,869 --> 01:26:23,149
They're restarting the server, I think.

1588
01:26:31,619 --> 01:26:37,069
So is this so with this, this is going to be search and destroy, right?

1589
01:26:37,069 --> 01:26:37,390
Yeah.

1590
01:26:37,390 --> 01:26:38,430
So when you're dead, you're out.

1591
01:26:38,430 --> 01:26:40,300
So we've got to play careful.

1592
01:26:40,300 --> 01:26:40,859
Yep.

1593
01:26:40,859 --> 01:26:42,779
Make sure you play really, really careful.

1594
01:26:42,779 --> 01:26:43,420
Goku.

1595
01:26:43,420 --> 01:26:47,979
Is that a is that a Dragon Ball line?

1596
01:26:47,979 --> 01:26:48,539
Yep.

1597
01:26:48,539 --> 01:26:50,060
That's a Mr. That's Mr.

1598
01:26:50,060 --> 01:26:54,210
Safe Dragon Ball.

1599
01:26:54,210 --> 01:26:55,250
Wait, what?

1600
01:26:55,409 --> 01:26:55,890
No, no, no, no, no.

1601
01:26:55,890 --> 01:26:56,130
Really?

1602
01:26:56,130 --> 01:26:57,090
Never watch Dragon Ball.

1603
01:26:57,090 --> 01:26:57,409
You're lying.

1604
01:26:57,409 --> 01:26:58,369
You're lying.

1605
01:26:58,369 --> 01:26:59,699
Not lying.

1606
01:26:59,699 --> 01:27:00,260
Is that bad?

1607
01:27:00,819 --> 01:27:02,020
I mean, it's bad.

1608
01:27:02,020 --> 01:27:03,810
How old are you?

1609
01:27:03,810 --> 01:27:04,529
Oh, 23.

1610
01:27:06,850 --> 01:27:07,970
23.

1611
01:27:07,970 --> 01:27:08,979
Yep.

1612
01:27:08,979 --> 01:27:09,859
I Dragon Ball.

1613
01:27:09,859 --> 01:27:12,819
I mean, like Dragon Ball Dragon Ball or any.

1614
01:27:12,819 --> 01:27:14,020
My parents should have had me earlier.

1615
01:27:14,020 --> 01:27:14,979
28, bro.

1616
01:27:14,979 --> 01:27:15,619
Why the fuck that?

1617
01:27:17,380 --> 01:27:20,050
What the bro?

1618
01:27:20,609 --> 01:27:21,489
What the?

1619
01:27:21,489 --> 01:27:22,850
That's 28.

1620
01:27:22,850 --> 01:27:24,529
Bro, I thought you were 28.

1621
01:27:24,529 --> 01:27:25,329
Come on, man.

1622
01:27:25,970 --> 01:27:27,250
Oh, shit.

1623
01:27:28,050 --> 01:27:29,250
I look like a boomer.

1624
01:27:31,420 --> 01:27:32,380
I thought you were 28.

1625
01:27:39,659 --> 01:27:40,699
How old do you think I am?

1626
01:27:40,699 --> 01:27:42,239
Let me take a guess.

1627
01:27:42,239 --> 01:27:42,720
28.

1628
01:27:42,720 --> 01:27:43,680
25.

1629
01:27:43,680 --> 01:27:48,050
Who's closer?

1630
01:27:48,050 --> 01:27:51,149
You are both very far away.

1631
01:27:51,149 --> 01:27:52,189
No way.

1632
01:27:52,189 --> 01:27:53,149
Incredibly far away.

1633
01:27:53,149 --> 01:27:53,550
18?

1634
01:27:53,550 --> 01:27:54,189
Incredibly.

1635
01:27:54,189 --> 01:27:54,750
No way.

1636
01:27:54,750 --> 01:27:55,229
18?

1637
01:27:55,229 --> 01:27:56,619
Way higher.

1638
01:27:56,619 --> 01:27:57,119
Oh.

1639
01:27:57,899 --> 01:27:59,039
38.

1640
01:27:59,039 --> 01:28:00,880
A little bit lower.

1641
01:28:00,880 --> 01:28:02,750
35.

1642
01:28:02,750 --> 01:28:03,630
A little bit higher.

1643
01:28:03,630 --> 01:28:05,199
36.

1644
01:28:05,199 --> 01:28:05,680
Yep.

1645
01:28:05,680 --> 01:28:06,560
That's it.

1646
01:28:06,560 --> 01:28:06,880
Wow.

1647
01:28:06,880 --> 01:28:08,079
I would not have guessed.

1648
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:11,119
Well, I mean, yeah, I didn't guess.

1649
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:13,439
Don't tell anybody that, though.

1650
01:28:13,439 --> 01:28:14,479
I don't know if you guys are streaming.

1651
01:28:14,479 --> 01:28:15,119
Hopefully, you're muted.

1652
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:16,479
I keep that.

1653
01:28:16,479 --> 01:28:17,359
I don't know.

1654
01:28:18,159 --> 01:28:20,029
I say I'm 32.

1655
01:28:20,029 --> 01:28:22,590
I've been 32 for the last five years.

1656
01:28:22,590 --> 01:28:24,659
I feel like after a certain age,

1657
01:28:24,659 --> 01:28:28,619
it feels all about the same.

1658
01:28:28,619 --> 01:28:29,739
Eating the same oatmeal.

1659
01:28:29,739 --> 01:28:30,220
Yeah.

1660
01:28:30,220 --> 01:28:33,020
After 30, it's just like whatever.

1661
01:28:33,020 --> 01:28:36,079
I always thought when I was like 25, 28,

1662
01:28:36,079 --> 01:28:38,079
I was like, oh, man, I don't want to turn 30.

1663
01:28:38,079 --> 01:28:38,800
No, fuck.

1664
01:28:38,800 --> 01:28:40,000
I'm going to be so old.

1665
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:40,880
Anyway, I dreaded it.

1666
01:28:40,880 --> 01:28:45,199
Like, you know, did you used to be a cod YouTuber?

1667
01:28:45,199 --> 01:28:45,760
No.

1668
01:28:45,760 --> 01:28:46,260
Why?

1669
01:28:46,399 --> 01:28:48,159
You used to be a League of Legends YouTuber.

1670
01:28:48,159 --> 01:28:49,039
Chat's lying.

1671
01:28:49,039 --> 01:28:50,239
Chat's just camping.

1672
01:28:50,239 --> 01:28:52,579
I'm 29, bro.

1673
01:28:52,579 --> 01:28:53,380
Yeah, don't worry.

1674
01:28:53,380 --> 01:28:54,500
After 30 doesn't matter.

1675
01:28:54,500 --> 01:28:59,420
I used to be a League of Legends YouTuber back in the day.

1676
01:28:59,420 --> 01:29:00,140
Solid duty.

1677
01:29:00,140 --> 01:29:02,590
I mean, that's pretty different from cod.

1678
01:29:02,590 --> 01:29:03,149
Yeah.

1679
01:29:03,149 --> 01:29:09,170
I mean, I played it before, but I wasn't like a cod YouTuber.

1680
01:29:09,170 --> 01:29:10,050
That's for sure.

1681
01:29:10,050 --> 01:29:12,460
All right.

1682
01:29:12,460 --> 01:29:13,020
We're good to go.

1683
01:29:13,739 --> 01:29:14,539
Am I in the game?

1684
01:29:16,689 --> 01:29:17,329
Am I?

1685
01:29:17,329 --> 01:29:17,890
Why are you?

1686
01:29:18,689 --> 01:29:19,810
I was just spectating for some reason.

1687
01:29:19,810 --> 01:29:27,100
I don't know why.

1688
01:29:27,100 --> 01:29:28,220
SNG, baby.

1689
01:29:28,859 --> 01:29:32,659
Remember, the secondhand embarrassment is killing us.

1690
01:29:32,659 --> 01:29:34,050
Stop.

1691
01:29:34,050 --> 01:29:36,050
I'm muted nine out of 10 times.

1692
01:29:36,050 --> 01:29:37,250
We get video once.

1693
01:29:37,250 --> 01:29:38,449
We're just having a good time.

1694
01:29:38,449 --> 01:29:38,930
Relax.

1695
01:29:38,930 --> 01:29:40,210
I've played before, but.

1696
01:29:40,210 --> 01:29:41,729
Secondhand embarrassment.

1697
01:29:41,729 --> 01:29:44,930
Hey, well, then good, because my tweet, that's what you're here for.

1698
01:29:46,270 --> 01:29:50,819
Yeah, I mean, I've played the game before, and that's like, and like, not even a lot.

1699
01:29:50,819 --> 01:29:51,859
Like, maybe once.

1700
01:29:51,859 --> 01:29:56,220
That's about as far as it goes.

1701
01:29:56,220 --> 01:29:57,180
You're clapping them, though.

1702
01:29:57,180 --> 01:29:59,819
You guys think I'm saying half of this stuff into the public lobby here?

1703
01:29:59,819 --> 01:30:03,340
I think anyone who would call me a cod YouTuber is

1704
01:30:03,340 --> 01:30:05,020
got to be horribly confused.

1705
01:30:05,020 --> 01:30:06,289
Gotcha.

1706
01:30:06,289 --> 01:30:06,689
All right.

1707
01:30:06,689 --> 01:30:09,090
Maybe we should split up where we're where we defend.

1708
01:30:09,090 --> 01:30:19,100
I'm thinking we would go like to to to a to be Dean and Saikuno a a a.

1709
01:30:19,100 --> 01:30:19,420
All right.

1710
01:30:19,420 --> 01:30:19,819
Alien.

1711
01:30:19,819 --> 01:30:20,460
Alias.

1712
01:30:21,500 --> 01:30:21,899
Sounds good.

1713
01:30:22,460 --> 01:30:23,180
Rotate.

1714
01:30:23,180 --> 01:30:24,539
Wait, Valorant.

1715
01:30:24,539 --> 01:30:25,500
Valorant.

1716
01:30:25,500 --> 01:30:27,180
Oh, he's your juice then, right?

1717
01:30:27,180 --> 01:30:27,979
I think that's good for.

1718
01:30:27,979 --> 01:30:31,180
I hope I hope I hope.

1719
01:30:31,180 --> 01:30:31,899
I'm pretty sure that's.

1720
01:30:31,899 --> 01:30:34,220
Yeah, that's like long, long sites and shit.

1721
01:30:34,220 --> 01:30:39,279
Let's hold the bombs down and let's fucking let's clap these kids.

1722
01:30:39,279 --> 01:30:41,659
Yeah, I'm not afraid.

1723
01:30:41,659 --> 01:30:46,220
I'm not afraid to take a stance.

1724
01:30:46,220 --> 01:30:59,550
Oh, oh, we have no one on B.

1725
01:30:59,550 --> 01:31:01,229
We're heading over there.

1726
01:31:01,229 --> 01:31:04,289
It's a first floor.

1727
01:31:04,289 --> 01:31:05,970
They're on B B planning.

1728
01:31:05,970 --> 01:31:06,210
Yeah.

1729
01:31:06,210 --> 01:31:07,810
Oh, I'm dead.

1730
01:31:07,810 --> 01:31:09,699
Thank God they're on B.

1731
01:31:09,699 --> 01:31:10,579
Oh, I just didn't get it.

1732
01:31:11,140 --> 01:31:15,100
I've never played this game mode.

1733
01:31:15,100 --> 01:31:17,020
I just got shot from the second floor.

1734
01:31:17,020 --> 01:31:18,140
Didn't even see him.

1735
01:31:18,140 --> 01:31:23,949
I've literally never played search and destroy ever.

1736
01:31:23,949 --> 01:31:26,449
Fuck one inside of a window B.

1737
01:31:26,449 --> 01:31:27,409
I'll just do.

1738
01:31:29,069 --> 01:31:29,630
Yeah, I'm dead.

1739
01:31:30,670 --> 01:31:32,189
Turning corner with a grenade.

1740
01:31:37,630 --> 01:31:38,350
My eyes closed.

1741
01:31:38,350 --> 01:31:40,270
Besides, I think we're attacked now.

1742
01:31:40,270 --> 01:31:42,050
I'm not going to lie.

1743
01:31:42,050 --> 01:31:46,529
They're literally playing this like Valorant and not like S&D.

1744
01:31:47,170 --> 01:31:49,250
I don't think I've ever had it.

1745
01:31:49,250 --> 01:31:54,779
I don't think I've ever played an S&D thing where people just instantly went and planted.

1746
01:31:55,819 --> 01:31:57,180
We gave them B site, though.

1747
01:31:57,180 --> 01:31:58,899
We had no one there.

1748
01:31:58,899 --> 01:32:01,659
Just thinking bomb.

1749
01:32:01,659 --> 01:32:02,300
All right.

1750
01:32:02,300 --> 01:32:04,380
I'm thinking I'm thinking we try to like work A here.

1751
01:32:04,859 --> 01:32:07,659
Do I have to be holding this?

1752
01:32:07,659 --> 01:32:09,020
They're going to be holding this hard.

1753
01:32:09,020 --> 01:32:10,539
Just rush in guys.

1754
01:32:10,539 --> 01:32:16,079
Just full speed blast kind of thing.

1755
01:32:16,079 --> 01:32:16,880
One's on the rocks.

1756
01:32:17,760 --> 01:32:21,100
I have mid control.

1757
01:32:22,939 --> 01:32:23,420
They're on A.

1758
01:32:26,510 --> 01:32:37,250
Hold up.

1759
01:32:37,250 --> 01:32:38,930
They gave me a lot of space here.

1760
01:32:38,930 --> 01:32:40,100
Could we get bombed down?

1761
01:32:40,739 --> 01:32:41,859
Yeah, putting it down.

1762
01:32:41,859 --> 01:32:42,739
Doesn't matter where.

1763
01:32:42,739 --> 01:32:43,619
Basketball court.

1764
01:32:43,619 --> 01:32:43,939
Nope.

1765
01:32:43,939 --> 01:32:44,659
Nope.

1766
01:32:44,659 --> 01:32:49,039
All right, it's done.

1767
01:32:50,479 --> 01:32:51,119
Oh, my God.

1768
01:32:51,119 --> 01:32:51,600
He knifed.

1769
01:32:53,680 --> 01:32:55,229
I got one.

1770
01:32:55,229 --> 01:33:02,300
They're playing up.

1771
01:33:02,300 --> 01:33:03,020
How many do they got left?

1772
01:33:03,020 --> 01:33:03,819
One.

1773
01:33:03,819 --> 01:33:04,460
Nice.

1774
01:33:04,460 --> 01:33:05,100
One's prone.

1775
01:33:05,100 --> 01:33:05,659
That's John.

1776
01:33:05,659 --> 01:33:06,619
He's only got a knife.

1777
01:33:06,619 --> 01:33:07,500
He's only got a knife.

1778
01:33:09,340 --> 01:33:09,500
Where?

1779
01:33:09,500 --> 01:33:09,659
Where?

1780
01:33:09,659 --> 01:33:10,380
Where?

1781
01:33:10,380 --> 01:33:12,140
He's he's he's proning next to the I don't know.

1782
01:33:12,140 --> 01:33:13,500
Is he happy with whatever?

1783
01:33:13,500 --> 01:33:14,300
He fucking did it.

1784
01:33:14,300 --> 01:33:15,100
I died with a knife.

1785
01:33:16,460 --> 01:33:16,939
He shot.

1786
01:33:17,739 --> 01:33:19,420
What the fuck happened?

1787
01:33:19,420 --> 01:33:21,260
He hit you with the ballistic knife.

1788
01:33:22,619 --> 01:33:22,939
Why?

1789
01:33:26,210 --> 01:33:26,609
Let's go.

1790
01:33:26,609 --> 01:33:27,409
Yes, we got it.

1791
01:33:27,409 --> 01:33:29,569
Oh, my God.

1792
01:33:29,569 --> 01:33:30,689
Oh, God.

1793
01:33:30,689 --> 01:33:37,789
Here's this fucking ballistic knife.

1794
01:33:37,789 --> 01:33:38,829
Jet main, dude.

1795
01:33:38,909 --> 01:33:40,750
He's actually playing like he's jet.

1796
01:33:40,750 --> 01:33:41,470
It's so good.

1797
01:33:42,510 --> 01:33:44,100
It's so good.

1798
01:33:44,100 --> 01:33:50,479
He peeked around the corner and I just went like it's dead.

1799
01:33:50,479 --> 01:33:51,039
All right.

1800
01:33:51,039 --> 01:33:54,180
Let's make sure.

1801
01:33:54,180 --> 01:33:57,090
Let's have some B defense at the start here.

1802
01:33:57,090 --> 01:33:57,810
Nice.

1803
01:33:57,810 --> 01:33:59,649
I'm going to hold A like you said earlier.

1804
01:33:59,649 --> 01:34:00,210
I like this.

1805
01:34:00,210 --> 01:34:00,449
Yeah.

1806
01:34:00,449 --> 01:34:00,609
Yeah.

1807
01:34:00,609 --> 01:34:01,090
I'm on A.

1808
01:34:01,090 --> 01:34:01,649
I'm on A.

1809
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:06,319
I think they're pushing B hard.

1810
01:34:06,319 --> 01:34:06,880
Yeah.

1811
01:34:06,880 --> 01:34:07,680
I'm in the window.

1812
01:34:11,500 --> 01:34:12,140
That's them.

1813
01:34:12,140 --> 01:34:13,020
They just leave mid open.

1814
01:34:13,020 --> 01:34:13,420
That's them.

1815
01:34:13,420 --> 01:34:14,720
That's them.

1816
01:34:14,720 --> 01:34:15,600
I have a hot flank.

1817
01:34:16,960 --> 01:34:21,520
Yeah, I'm working.

1818
01:34:25,550 --> 01:34:26,109
I muted.

1819
01:34:26,510 --> 01:34:27,390
What am I doing?

1820
01:34:27,390 --> 01:34:28,189
The grenade.

1821
01:34:30,189 --> 01:34:32,989
Let me run around the corner with a fucking.

1822
01:34:32,989 --> 01:34:35,069
It's a FPS video game.

1823
01:34:35,069 --> 01:34:35,869
Single player.

1824
01:34:36,430 --> 01:34:37,630
I'm the enemy.

1825
01:34:37,630 --> 01:34:38,590
Moving up.

1826
01:34:38,590 --> 01:34:39,869
That's what they do.

1827
01:34:39,869 --> 01:34:43,229
They come around the corner and they fucking lob it like a softball.

1828
01:34:43,229 --> 01:34:43,550
Let's go.

1829
01:34:43,550 --> 01:34:44,109
We got it, baby.

1830
01:34:44,109 --> 01:34:44,909
Let's go, baby.

1831
01:34:47,010 --> 01:34:47,489
Nice job.

1832
01:34:47,489 --> 01:34:48,590
Let's go.

1833
01:34:48,590 --> 01:34:50,180
One up.

1834
01:34:50,180 --> 01:34:51,220
We're S&D'ers.

1835
01:34:51,779 --> 01:34:52,420
Look at this shit.

1836
01:34:55,600 --> 01:34:56,560
Oh, man.

1837
01:34:56,560 --> 01:34:59,039
I'm not going to lie to that initial burst right there.

1838
01:35:00,079 --> 01:35:02,159
Yeah, we're not talking about that, but you know.

1839
01:35:02,159 --> 01:35:04,079
That shit was clean, my boy.

1840
01:35:05,039 --> 01:35:06,159
Thank you, my boy.

1841
01:35:06,159 --> 01:35:07,199
Come on, let's get two up.

1842
01:35:07,199 --> 01:35:07,760
All right, let's go.

1843
01:35:07,760 --> 01:35:08,000
Let's go.

1844
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:08,479
What do I got?

1845
01:35:08,479 --> 01:35:08,960
Zero kills.

1846
01:35:09,600 --> 01:35:11,199
They leave mid dead open, bro.

1847
01:35:11,199 --> 01:35:12,319
It's literally a glitch.

1848
01:35:12,319 --> 01:35:12,960
Everyone mid.

1849
01:35:12,960 --> 01:35:14,079
Everyone made it.

1850
01:35:14,079 --> 01:35:14,899
Wait, no, no, no.

1851
01:35:15,939 --> 01:35:16,899
Okay, fuck it.

1852
01:35:16,899 --> 01:35:17,699
We got it.

1853
01:35:17,699 --> 01:35:19,779
Yeah, this is where we're going to be.

1854
01:35:19,779 --> 01:35:20,739
Oh, here's mid this time.

1855
01:35:20,739 --> 01:35:21,220
Good job.

1856
01:35:21,220 --> 01:35:22,380
Let's go B.

1857
01:35:22,380 --> 01:35:23,420
Yep, yep, yep.

1858
01:35:23,420 --> 01:35:24,539
Window, window.

1859
01:35:24,539 --> 01:35:26,460
I'm watching it rotate.

1860
01:35:26,460 --> 01:35:28,140
I like regenerate or something, right?

1861
01:35:28,140 --> 01:35:29,899
I mean, I think.

1862
01:35:29,899 --> 01:35:33,310
I'm scared.

1863
01:35:33,310 --> 01:35:34,510
Yeah, you're regenerating, I think.

1864
01:35:34,510 --> 01:35:35,310
That's okay.

1865
01:35:35,310 --> 01:35:35,630
All right.

1866
01:35:35,630 --> 01:35:36,829
I think we go bomb A.

1867
01:35:36,829 --> 01:35:37,310
Go bomb A.

1868
01:35:37,310 --> 01:35:38,510
Go bomb A now.

1869
01:35:38,510 --> 01:35:39,069
Oh, God.

1870
01:35:39,069 --> 01:35:40,510
I'm dying, man.

1871
01:35:40,510 --> 01:35:41,710
I'm dying.

1872
01:35:41,710 --> 01:35:43,550
I just don't know where anybody could be.

1873
01:35:45,250 --> 01:35:48,770
A game like this, you need to know where people can come from.

1874
01:35:48,770 --> 01:35:51,970
And I just put a fucking bat on the ground.

1875
01:35:51,970 --> 01:35:54,770
Put it on my head like this and just went in a circle.

1876
01:35:54,770 --> 01:35:56,859
Spin, spin, spin, spin, spin, spin.

1877
01:35:56,859 --> 01:35:57,500
Sick.

1878
01:35:57,500 --> 01:35:58,460
All right, where is he?

1879
01:35:58,460 --> 01:35:59,260
Where's the bad guy?

1880
01:35:59,260 --> 01:36:00,140
I don't see the A player.

1881
01:36:01,500 --> 01:36:02,300
We step outside.

1882
01:36:03,420 --> 01:36:04,539
They have one left, just sim.

1883
01:36:06,560 --> 01:36:07,680
Basketball court, basketball court.

1884
01:36:07,680 --> 01:36:08,319
Okay.

1885
01:36:08,319 --> 01:36:09,279
Yeah, let's go.

1886
01:36:09,279 --> 01:36:09,680
I'm sorry.

1887
01:36:09,680 --> 01:36:13,039
I'm an idiot.

1888
01:36:13,039 --> 01:36:13,439
Okay.

1889
01:36:16,659 --> 01:36:19,279
Oh, it was the basketball court.

1890
01:36:19,279 --> 01:36:21,039
Sakuno taking out symphony.

1891
01:36:21,039 --> 01:36:21,840
Oh, there it is.

1892
01:36:21,840 --> 01:36:23,359
The 1v1 challenge.

1893
01:36:23,359 --> 01:36:23,840
There it is.

1894
01:36:23,840 --> 01:36:24,560
Just peeking him.

1895
01:36:24,560 --> 01:36:27,220
That's great.

1896
01:36:27,220 --> 01:36:30,500
Isn't it so funny that they're not hearing me freak out every time?

1897
01:36:30,500 --> 01:36:31,779
All they're hearing is like, let's go.

1898
01:36:31,779 --> 01:36:32,739
Oh, sick.

1899
01:36:32,739 --> 01:36:41,899
Keep this shit hot.

1900
01:36:41,899 --> 01:36:45,229
All right, I hear a lot of stuns, eh?

1901
01:36:45,229 --> 01:36:46,029
Yeah, I'm looking.

1902
01:36:46,029 --> 01:36:50,289
I'm here to help you defend.

1903
01:36:50,289 --> 01:36:51,569
Let me know if they hear push up.

1904
01:36:51,569 --> 01:36:52,689
I'm going to watch mid still.

1905
01:36:52,689 --> 01:36:55,619
They're smoking, probably planting B.

1906
01:36:55,619 --> 01:36:55,939
That's all right.

1907
01:36:55,939 --> 01:36:56,659
It's a B rotate.

1908
01:36:58,420 --> 01:36:59,460
Behind, behind, behind.

1909
01:36:59,460 --> 01:37:09,619
In our spawn?

1910
01:37:09,619 --> 01:37:10,579
That was weird.

1911
01:37:10,579 --> 01:37:11,140
Fuck, man.

1912
01:37:12,850 --> 01:37:13,810
Is there a head there, man?

1913
01:37:14,369 --> 01:37:20,340
I just have no idea where people can come from.

1914
01:37:20,340 --> 01:37:21,380
Don't look at your teammate.

1915
01:37:22,020 --> 01:37:23,539
Guys, I don't know even where to walk.

1916
01:37:24,899 --> 01:37:34,779
Fuck.

1917
01:37:34,779 --> 01:37:35,420
Oh, shit.

1918
01:37:35,420 --> 01:37:36,140
He was the nicest guy.

1919
01:37:36,140 --> 01:37:36,460
It's close.

1920
01:37:36,460 --> 01:37:37,100
I didn't even see him.

1921
01:37:37,100 --> 01:37:37,979
Yeah, NT, NT.

1922
01:37:44,640 --> 01:37:45,680
It was three of them up.

1923
01:37:48,420 --> 01:37:51,250
It's okay.

1924
01:37:51,250 --> 01:37:51,810
We got this.

1925
01:37:52,529 --> 01:37:53,890
Somebody said, what the fuck?

1926
01:37:53,890 --> 01:37:54,850
Call of duty.

1927
01:37:54,850 --> 01:37:56,289
10 year old Andy.

1928
01:37:56,289 --> 01:37:58,670
I think it's a first to six.

1929
01:37:59,229 --> 01:38:00,979
Do you mean the game is 10 years old

1930
01:38:00,979 --> 01:38:02,420
or you mean calling me a 10 year old?

1931
01:38:02,420 --> 01:38:04,210
Because this game's fun.

1932
01:38:04,210 --> 01:38:06,619
PK again.

1933
01:38:08,659 --> 01:38:11,550
I got the bomb.

1934
01:38:11,550 --> 01:38:13,470
Oh, two fucking peeking mid.

1935
01:38:16,590 --> 01:38:17,390
One A window.

1936
01:38:18,369 --> 01:38:19,250
Symphony's pushing B.

1937
01:38:21,100 --> 01:38:22,380
He's probably going to try and go flank.

1938
01:38:27,890 --> 01:38:28,850
What the fuck?

1939
01:38:28,850 --> 01:38:29,890
I'm so confused right now.

1940
01:38:29,890 --> 01:38:32,399
That's me, that's me.

1941
01:38:32,399 --> 01:38:33,520
He's in the building.

1942
01:38:33,520 --> 01:38:34,640
He's in the building.

1943
01:38:39,199 --> 01:38:40,399
I can't play.

1944
01:38:40,399 --> 01:38:41,199
Why do you guys think

1945
01:38:41,199 --> 01:38:43,359
I've never played Counter-Strike?

1946
01:38:43,359 --> 01:38:44,079
Ever.

1947
01:38:44,079 --> 01:38:45,039
And Valorant?

1948
01:38:45,039 --> 01:38:45,920
I won't even open it.

1949
01:38:47,760 --> 01:38:48,960
I don't want to die.

1950
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:49,279
I'm dead.

1951
01:38:49,279 --> 01:38:49,840
Oh, Dean.

1952
01:38:51,140 --> 01:38:52,420
I whipped so hard, bro.

1953
01:38:52,420 --> 01:38:53,380
I didn't come in there.

1954
01:38:53,380 --> 01:38:54,579
You know, I'm going to pretend

1955
01:38:54,579 --> 01:38:56,340
I totally didn't see that.

1956
01:38:56,340 --> 01:38:56,979
Nice job.

1957
01:38:56,979 --> 01:38:57,460
There it is.

1958
01:38:57,460 --> 01:38:59,380
Hey, hey, but the comms though.

1959
01:38:59,380 --> 01:39:00,420
But the comms though.

1960
01:39:01,859 --> 01:39:03,539
You know, sometimes,

1961
01:39:03,539 --> 01:39:04,979
you know, it'd be like that sometimes.

1962
01:39:04,979 --> 01:39:06,340
Everyone has one.

1963
01:39:06,340 --> 01:39:07,380
Everyone has one.

1964
01:39:07,460 --> 01:39:09,380
Yep, it happens to the best of them.

1965
01:39:09,380 --> 01:39:10,819
It really does.

1966
01:39:10,819 --> 01:39:11,619
It really does.

1967
01:39:11,619 --> 01:39:13,890
Only up from here now.

1968
01:39:13,890 --> 01:39:15,489
Wait, wait, I hit rock bottom?

1969
01:39:19,420 --> 01:39:20,539
I don't know, man.

1970
01:39:20,539 --> 01:39:27,390
Let me chow mid.

1971
01:39:27,390 --> 01:39:28,989
One's going A, one's going A.

1972
01:39:28,989 --> 01:39:30,189
I didn't see anybody.

1973
01:39:30,189 --> 01:39:31,949
They got like two mid control.

1974
01:39:31,949 --> 01:39:33,220
I'm going to go help out A.

1975
01:39:33,220 --> 01:39:34,180
You go B, K.

1976
01:39:34,180 --> 01:39:34,659
Thanks.

1977
01:39:34,659 --> 01:39:35,699
Yeah, let's go, let's go, let's go.

1978
01:39:38,180 --> 01:39:38,979
B, B, B.

1979
01:39:38,979 --> 01:39:42,500
He's down.

1980
01:39:42,500 --> 01:39:43,460
I don't see anybody at B yet.

1981
01:39:43,460 --> 01:39:44,420
A window, A window, A window.

1982
01:39:44,420 --> 01:39:46,909
Behind you, behind you.

1983
01:39:46,909 --> 01:39:47,390
B.

1984
01:39:47,390 --> 01:39:50,159
Oh, fuck.

1985
01:39:50,159 --> 01:39:51,359
Two mid, one mid.

1986
01:39:51,359 --> 01:39:53,340
One in that window.

1987
01:39:53,340 --> 01:40:02,399
I think Syke could be like in our spawn and shit.

1988
01:40:02,399 --> 01:40:03,520
I don't know.

1989
01:40:03,520 --> 01:40:04,159
They're on B?

1990
01:40:04,159 --> 01:40:04,560
B, okay.

1991
01:40:04,560 --> 01:40:04,880
Where?

1992
01:40:08,930 --> 01:40:09,569
He's tapped out.

1993
01:40:09,569 --> 01:40:10,609
I hit him a bunch of times on B.

1994
01:40:10,609 --> 01:40:11,729
There's one left.

1995
01:40:11,729 --> 01:40:13,329
Just mass, just John.

1996
01:40:13,329 --> 01:40:14,130
He's behind van.

1997
01:40:14,130 --> 01:40:15,489
Blue van, blue van.

1998
01:40:15,489 --> 01:40:17,420
Let's go, Jerma.

1999
01:40:19,340 --> 01:40:21,539
Let's go.

2000
01:40:23,229 --> 01:40:24,430
Good shit, K.

2001
01:40:24,430 --> 01:40:25,069
Here we go.

2002
01:40:26,130 --> 01:40:26,930
You got to do a 360.

2003
01:40:26,930 --> 01:40:27,329
Why are you doing it?

2004
01:40:27,329 --> 01:40:28,369
Because that's how the cool people do it.

2005
01:40:28,930 --> 01:40:29,329
Facts.

2006
01:40:32,369 --> 01:40:35,090
Not a controller player.

2007
01:40:35,090 --> 01:40:37,729
Somebody said, dude, you got famous on FPS games.

2008
01:40:38,689 --> 01:40:40,369
This is like 12 years ago.

2009
01:40:40,369 --> 01:40:43,489
People didn't even know how to tie their shoes in FPS games.

2010
01:40:44,930 --> 01:40:45,569
Yeah, of course.

2011
01:40:46,130 --> 01:40:47,170
I was fine back then.

2012
01:40:47,170 --> 01:40:47,729
I'm on the leaderboard.

2013
01:40:56,850 --> 01:40:58,750
Hacker who?

2014
01:40:58,750 --> 01:41:00,829
At least Jerma is out fragging Buddha.

2015
01:41:00,829 --> 01:41:02,109
So web that for us.

2016
01:41:03,149 --> 01:41:04,989
I did okay in that last round, I will say.

2017
01:41:06,029 --> 01:41:06,909
No one's peeking mid.

2018
01:41:06,909 --> 01:41:07,550
That's us.

2019
01:41:07,550 --> 01:41:08,350
Oh, I need to grab bomb.

2020
01:41:08,350 --> 01:41:09,470
I'm going to grab bomb for us.

2021
01:41:09,470 --> 01:41:11,010
Yo, let's end this shit right here.

2022
01:41:11,010 --> 01:41:11,649
Let's play safe.

2023
01:41:11,649 --> 01:41:12,210
Let's play tight.

2024
01:41:12,210 --> 01:41:12,689
Let's play right.

2025
01:41:12,689 --> 01:41:14,210
I'm going to go A with bomb.

2026
01:41:14,210 --> 01:41:16,529
Once I got him up a few times.

2027
01:41:17,760 --> 01:41:21,359
There's somebody on the right side.

2028
01:41:21,359 --> 01:41:26,369
I'm going to push out here.

2029
01:41:26,369 --> 01:41:26,770
Careful.

2030
01:41:26,770 --> 01:41:27,569
There's one.

2031
01:41:27,569 --> 01:41:29,090
He might have backed off.

2032
01:41:29,090 --> 01:41:30,460
B ball, B ball.

2033
01:41:30,460 --> 01:41:30,859
Yeah.

2034
01:41:30,859 --> 01:41:33,020
No, he's he's up in the corner out there.

2035
01:41:33,020 --> 01:41:34,560
At their window.

2036
01:41:34,560 --> 01:41:36,899
You'll see him to your right.

2037
01:41:36,899 --> 01:41:37,140
Yeah.

2038
01:41:38,529 --> 01:41:43,489
As my first YouTube videos, I had like boogers coming out of my nose.

2039
01:41:46,180 --> 01:41:47,619
You whacking son of a bitch.

2040
01:41:47,619 --> 01:41:49,220
It was a different world back then.

2041
01:41:49,220 --> 01:41:51,060
If we had some held there, you won that.

2042
01:41:51,619 --> 01:41:52,260
I was just like.

2043
01:41:52,819 --> 01:41:56,659
Hey, guys, I'm playing as the spy, I think.

2044
01:41:56,659 --> 01:41:57,380
I don't know.

2045
01:41:57,380 --> 01:41:57,939
Whatever.

2046
01:41:57,939 --> 01:41:59,300
I don't know.

2047
01:41:59,300 --> 01:42:02,939
All right, bro.

2048
01:42:02,939 --> 01:42:03,739
Let's get the all orbs.

2049
01:42:11,220 --> 01:42:13,140
Our defense is too mean.

2050
01:42:13,140 --> 01:42:14,659
I think we got it on defense.

2051
01:42:24,109 --> 01:42:24,909
Definitely 1A.

2052
01:42:24,909 --> 01:42:26,930
100% 1A.

2053
01:42:26,930 --> 01:42:27,329
Roger.

2054
01:42:27,970 --> 01:42:28,850
He's on site.

2055
01:42:28,850 --> 01:42:29,409
He's on site.

2056
01:42:29,409 --> 01:42:29,890
He's on site.

2057
01:42:29,890 --> 01:42:31,329
OK, OK, OK.

2058
01:42:31,329 --> 01:42:32,369
Falling back then.

2059
01:42:32,369 --> 01:42:33,090
I'm going to play with you.

2060
01:42:38,260 --> 01:42:39,380
Yeah, I died from window.

2061
01:42:40,340 --> 01:42:42,579
There's two bottom and then one up top.

2062
01:42:42,579 --> 01:42:42,899
Yep.

2063
01:42:43,140 --> 01:42:47,390
They're on the right side here.

2064
01:42:47,390 --> 01:42:51,199
Fuck.

2065
01:42:51,199 --> 01:42:52,800
Try to stun him out or some shit.

2066
01:42:52,800 --> 01:42:53,199
Oh, shit.

2067
01:42:53,199 --> 01:42:54,560
He's down, down, down, down, downstairs.

2068
01:42:56,380 --> 01:42:57,340
I thought he was still upstairs.

2069
01:42:58,239 --> 01:42:59,199
Are you able to get defuse?

2070
01:42:59,920 --> 01:43:00,880
No, I couldn't.

2071
01:43:02,479 --> 01:43:03,520
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

2072
01:43:03,520 --> 01:43:04,640
Oh, you got it.

2073
01:43:05,840 --> 01:43:06,720
You got it.

2074
01:43:06,720 --> 01:43:07,199
Nice.

2075
01:43:07,199 --> 01:43:07,680
Let's go.

2076
01:43:08,319 --> 01:43:09,439
Let's go, baby.

2077
01:43:10,239 --> 01:43:11,760
I yelled as you defuse.

2078
01:43:11,760 --> 01:43:12,479
I couldn't hear it.

2079
01:43:20,930 --> 01:43:23,409
Just in case there was a ghost was coming on the other side of him.

2080
01:43:23,409 --> 01:43:23,810
You know what I mean?

2081
01:43:23,810 --> 01:43:24,369
So true.

2082
01:43:24,369 --> 01:43:26,159
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2083
01:43:26,159 --> 01:43:27,439
Got to make sure they're not breathing.

2084
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:29,439
I'm adjusting for lag.

2085
01:43:29,439 --> 01:43:33,699
There you go.

2086
01:43:33,699 --> 01:43:34,500
You outfragged him.

2087
01:43:34,500 --> 01:43:35,380
Let's go.

2088
01:43:35,380 --> 01:43:37,140
As long as you're outfragging them.

2089
01:43:37,140 --> 01:43:38,020
That's all that matters.

2090
01:43:40,479 --> 01:43:40,720
Nice.

2091
01:43:41,760 --> 01:43:42,239
That was fun.

2092
01:43:43,229 --> 01:43:43,789
That was fun.

2093
01:43:45,180 --> 01:43:48,800
Apparently, she fell off the map.

2094
01:43:48,800 --> 01:43:49,359
Wait, what?

2095
01:43:49,359 --> 01:43:49,840
That match?

2096
01:43:50,479 --> 01:43:51,039
I don't know.

2097
01:43:51,039 --> 01:43:52,399
Apparently, she fell off the map.

2098
01:44:02,350 --> 01:44:04,270
Newtown domination is next.

2099
01:44:04,270 --> 01:44:05,149
Oh, man.

2100
01:44:06,270 --> 01:44:07,229
It's going to be insane.

2101
01:44:09,699 --> 01:44:10,659
You guys up for it?

2102
01:44:12,180 --> 01:44:12,979
Yeah, yeah.

2103
01:44:12,979 --> 01:44:13,460
Let's do it.

2104
01:44:14,100 --> 01:44:58,659
Let's get it.

2105
01:44:58,659 --> 01:44:59,220
All right, let's go.

2106
01:44:59,220 --> 01:45:00,180
Is this domination?

2107
01:45:01,140 --> 01:45:02,260
Yeah, this is domination.

2108
01:45:02,260 --> 01:45:03,539
We got our first win.

2109
01:45:03,539 --> 01:45:05,380
Now, our morale is high.

2110
01:45:05,380 --> 01:45:06,659
I'm going to tell you right now, I'm going to pop.

2111
01:45:07,539 --> 01:45:08,100
I'm going to pop.

2112
01:45:08,100 --> 01:45:09,220
We're going to pop off.

2113
01:45:09,220 --> 01:45:10,500
We're going to pop off.

2114
01:45:10,500 --> 01:45:10,979
Check this out.

2115
01:45:10,979 --> 01:45:12,020
Gamma's going crazy.

2116
01:45:12,020 --> 01:45:13,380
He's going crazy for sure.

2117
01:45:17,470 --> 01:45:18,510
To all the doubters.

2118
01:45:18,510 --> 01:45:20,180
See you in 10 minutes.

2119
01:45:21,539 --> 01:45:23,699
You do Gamba in your stream?

2120
01:45:23,699 --> 01:45:24,340
Or not Gamba?

2121
01:45:24,340 --> 01:45:24,979
Like, you know.

2122
01:45:26,420 --> 01:45:27,460
No, I don't do like slots or anything.

2123
01:45:27,460 --> 01:45:28,100
Like predictions.

2124
01:45:28,100 --> 01:45:28,979
Predictions, I think.

2125
01:45:28,979 --> 01:45:30,739
Oh, that's bad.

2126
01:45:30,739 --> 01:45:34,189
Yeah, they got one going right now.

2127
01:45:34,189 --> 01:45:34,590
Oh, really?

2128
01:45:34,590 --> 01:45:36,829
It's not popping up for me.

2129
01:45:36,829 --> 01:45:38,350
I got to farm my channel points.

2130
01:45:39,470 --> 01:45:41,470
We up, we up.

2131
01:45:41,470 --> 01:45:43,100
All right.

2132
01:45:43,100 --> 01:45:43,659
That's time.

2133
01:45:44,979 --> 01:45:45,859
All right, now we win.

2134
01:45:48,579 --> 01:45:49,699
We ain't going home yet.

2135
01:45:52,770 --> 01:45:53,409
Let's go.

2136
01:45:53,409 --> 01:45:54,210
Yes, get it in.

2137
01:45:55,359 --> 01:45:56,560
Oxen agitation.

2138
01:45:56,560 --> 01:46:11,010
I'm going for B, I'm going for B now.

2139
01:46:11,649 --> 01:46:12,210
Yep, yep.

2140
01:46:13,010 --> 01:46:14,289
I'm just holding the window, champ.

2141
01:46:14,930 --> 01:46:19,649
They're coming from A, A, A, A.

2142
01:46:19,649 --> 01:46:20,289
Coming from A side?

2143
01:46:20,289 --> 01:46:21,170
Coming from A, yeah, yeah.

2144
01:46:21,810 --> 01:46:23,779
I'm going to take back A fast.

2145
01:46:23,779 --> 01:46:24,659
I got one.

2146
01:46:25,949 --> 01:46:27,310
Actually, we don't need A, just keep seeing.

2147
01:46:27,310 --> 01:46:28,270
Yeah, we don't need A, yeah, we don't need A.

2148
01:46:28,270 --> 01:46:30,270
Okay, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha.

2149
01:46:30,270 --> 01:46:32,590
He's on B, he's on B, he's on B, he's on B, he's on B.

2150
01:46:32,590 --> 01:46:33,470
He's wrong, he's wrong.

2151
01:46:34,270 --> 01:46:35,439
We're good, we're good.

2152
01:46:35,439 --> 01:46:36,319
Nading it.

2153
01:46:36,319 --> 01:46:37,039
Good shit.

2154
01:46:41,470 --> 01:46:42,750
Take his ass out.

2155
01:46:42,750 --> 01:46:45,779
Yeah, I'm going to hold garage.

2156
01:46:51,420 --> 01:46:53,340
I need somebody, I need somebody on the car side.

2157
01:46:53,340 --> 01:46:54,380
Whoa.

2158
01:46:54,380 --> 01:46:55,500
I need somebody on the car side, please.

2159
01:46:56,140 --> 01:46:56,539
I'm looking.

2160
01:46:58,130 --> 01:46:59,970
I'm going to get up, I'm blowing it up.

2161
01:46:59,970 --> 01:47:00,850
No one's out there anymore.

2162
01:47:01,569 --> 01:47:02,850
One mid car, I'm B, I'm B.

2163
01:47:06,050 --> 01:47:07,789
Got him.

2164
01:47:07,789 --> 01:47:09,550
Oh, he tried to light it.

2165
01:47:09,550 --> 01:47:10,829
I got you, I got you.

2166
01:47:10,829 --> 01:47:12,750
I'm B, I'm B, I'm B, I'm B, I'm B, I'm B, I'm B.

2167
01:47:12,750 --> 01:47:14,109
You got to make sure you clear site.

2168
01:47:14,109 --> 01:47:14,750
Yeah, I got you, I got you.

2169
01:47:14,750 --> 01:47:16,350
There you go, there you go, it's good now, it's good now.

2170
01:47:16,350 --> 01:47:17,149
Suppressing fire.

2171
01:47:17,869 --> 01:47:20,130
I'm holding garage.

2172
01:47:23,260 --> 01:47:25,180
John's going to fucking come out of that smoke on site.

2173
01:47:27,300 --> 01:47:28,340
Got two, I'm dead though.

2174
01:47:28,340 --> 01:47:29,460
On site still, on site still.

2175
01:47:29,460 --> 01:47:31,060
On site, on site, on site.

2176
01:47:31,060 --> 01:47:32,340
No, he fucking killed me.

2177
01:47:34,640 --> 01:47:36,079
Oh my god, I can't.

2178
01:47:36,079 --> 01:47:40,699
I got him, I got him, I got him, I got him.

2179
01:47:40,699 --> 01:47:53,569
Oh, fuck, we're suppressed here for a minute.

2180
01:47:53,569 --> 01:47:54,449
Let's play out now.

2181
01:47:55,250 --> 01:47:56,369
Getting into window.

2182
01:47:57,250 --> 01:47:59,939
Kill the dude that was playing car cross.

2183
01:48:00,340 --> 01:48:01,140
One in the window.

2184
01:48:03,260 --> 01:48:06,079
Mid car, mid car, trailer.

2185
01:48:06,079 --> 01:48:10,029
We got two, we're up right now.

2186
01:48:11,359 --> 01:48:12,880
Sim dead, I'm going for site.

2187
01:48:12,880 --> 01:48:14,159
It's prone, prone on car.

2188
01:48:14,159 --> 01:48:16,640
Yeah, he's prone on the floor.

2189
01:48:16,640 --> 01:48:25,899
I'm still alive.

2190
01:48:25,899 --> 01:48:26,060
Yes.

2191
01:48:26,060 --> 01:48:26,699
I'm not leaving.

2192
01:48:31,010 --> 01:48:32,050
All right, shake it, shake it, shake it.

2193
01:48:32,050 --> 01:48:33,329
Don't push too hard, don't push too far.

2194
01:48:33,970 --> 01:48:34,529
Come on, flip.

2195
01:48:35,090 --> 01:48:35,970
Just holding this fence.

2196
01:48:40,289 --> 01:48:41,649
I think it flipped, I think it flipped.

2197
01:48:41,649 --> 01:48:42,130
Yeah.

2198
01:48:42,130 --> 01:48:42,850
He was in the house.

2199
01:48:43,979 --> 01:48:44,619
Yeah, it's flipped.

2200
01:48:46,140 --> 01:48:47,100
No, it hasn't.

2201
01:48:47,100 --> 01:48:47,819
Wait, no, no, no, no.

2202
01:48:51,300 --> 01:48:52,260
Oh, my goodness.

2203
01:48:57,680 --> 01:48:58,880
I'm backing out of the spawn.

2204
01:48:58,880 --> 01:48:59,920
Fuck, I think I fucked it.

2205
01:49:00,739 --> 01:49:01,539
Not yet, actually.

2206
01:49:02,819 --> 01:49:08,739
I'm on a fucking beamer, yo.

2207
01:49:12,750 --> 01:49:13,229
One in mid.

2208
01:49:17,149 --> 01:49:19,789
Fuck, dude, that's a big twit on me.

2209
01:49:19,789 --> 01:49:20,350
Yeah, we're good.

2210
01:49:20,350 --> 01:49:22,350
We're playing the objective real nice, man.

2211
01:49:23,390 --> 01:49:25,630
Oh, I got some, I fell down a trip once.

2212
01:49:25,630 --> 01:49:28,029
He ran across, he ran across, he ran across.

2213
01:49:28,670 --> 01:49:29,949
Got one on B.

2214
01:49:31,579 --> 01:49:32,220
We're clear, we're clear.

2215
01:49:32,220 --> 01:49:33,819
Don't have spawn, all right, kill the Buddha.

2216
01:49:33,819 --> 01:49:34,460
Another one B.

2217
01:49:35,340 --> 01:49:36,779
Let's take a seat, let's take a seat.

2218
01:49:36,859 --> 01:49:37,739
Flip it, flip it, flip it.

2219
01:49:37,739 --> 01:49:38,539
Oh, god, I'm fucked.

2220
01:49:41,140 --> 01:49:42,260
Wait, they're still spawning.

2221
01:49:42,260 --> 01:49:42,659
A though?

2222
01:49:43,739 --> 01:49:45,819
Yeah, sometimes it messes up.

2223
01:49:45,819 --> 01:49:47,659
Yeah, that's real luck.

2224
01:49:47,659 --> 01:49:48,939
I'm going to cap C, I'm going to cap C.

2225
01:49:48,939 --> 01:49:49,579
Just play for B.

2226
01:49:50,460 --> 01:49:57,840
Playing for C, play for B still.

2227
01:49:57,840 --> 01:50:01,970
Even if you spawn A, you should be able to retake here.

2228
01:50:03,649 --> 01:50:09,920
Okay, I'm in here, I'm in here, capping B.

2229
01:50:10,880 --> 01:50:11,899
Try to take car.

2230
01:50:16,670 --> 01:50:17,630
Holy fuck, man.

2231
01:50:23,710 --> 01:50:24,210
Got truck.

2232
01:50:26,479 --> 01:50:28,159
Oh, I ran out of ammo.

2233
01:50:28,159 --> 01:50:29,119
Oh, god.

2234
01:50:33,890 --> 01:50:34,689
It's too much smoke.

2235
01:50:36,539 --> 01:50:37,659
Fuck the smoke.

2236
01:50:37,659 --> 01:50:40,460
Going for cap.

2237
01:50:41,680 --> 01:50:44,000
Once on, yeah, two.

2238
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:44,500
Shit.

2239
01:50:45,199 --> 01:50:46,619
Threw that nade away.

2240
01:50:47,180 --> 01:50:49,380
All right, it's tied up right now.

2241
01:50:51,779 --> 01:50:52,420
Oh, yes.

2242
01:50:52,420 --> 01:50:53,859
You got to run at the end, let's go.

2243
01:50:54,659 --> 01:50:55,300
Comeback season.

2244
01:50:55,300 --> 01:50:56,420
Close one.

2245
01:50:56,420 --> 01:50:57,380
We actually won.

2246
01:51:07,779 --> 01:51:09,739
That was good.

2247
01:51:09,739 --> 01:51:12,239
Yeah, we're up, we're up.

2248
01:51:12,239 --> 01:51:13,439
Look at, look at, hit tab.

2249
01:51:13,439 --> 01:51:15,119
We're out fucking fragging them.

2250
01:51:18,220 --> 01:51:21,340
We are better mechanically, it's just the fucking truth.

2251
01:51:22,510 --> 01:51:23,630
We do have mechanics, we do.

2252
01:51:23,630 --> 01:51:25,869
Okay, there's two of them on site, two of them on B, two of them on B.

2253
01:51:26,750 --> 01:51:27,470
Nading it.

2254
01:51:28,189 --> 01:51:32,319
I'm pushing B, pushing B.

2255
01:51:32,319 --> 01:51:33,119
Get in there, get in there.

2256
01:51:33,119 --> 01:51:35,520
I killed him off of it, I killed him off of it.

2257
01:51:37,380 --> 01:51:41,220
That was a, that was a big explosive.

2258
01:51:41,939 --> 01:51:42,979
Whatever that was.

2259
01:51:42,979 --> 01:51:44,819
He's in the corner, there's two in the corner.

2260
01:51:45,779 --> 01:51:46,420
NB, NB!

2261
01:51:47,460 --> 01:51:49,149
Hell Mary.

2262
01:51:50,560 --> 01:51:51,840
Hell Mary.

2263
01:51:51,840 --> 01:51:54,779
He's still in B, let's go.

2264
01:51:54,779 --> 01:51:58,350
Got him, got him on B.

2265
01:51:58,350 --> 01:52:00,350
In truck.

2266
01:52:00,350 --> 01:52:02,350
Wait, he capped it?

2267
01:52:02,350 --> 01:52:04,350
Oh, no way.

2268
01:52:04,350 --> 01:52:06,350
He's always proning near that fucking box, man.

2269
01:52:06,350 --> 01:52:09,810
Oh bro, those stuns are next level.

2270
01:52:09,810 --> 01:52:11,810
Alright, we gotta take car. If we push car, we have to angle on him.

2271
01:52:11,810 --> 01:52:13,810
Oh my god.

2272
01:52:13,810 --> 01:52:15,810
Dean, push car for us.

2273
01:52:15,810 --> 01:52:17,810
I got you, I got you.

2274
01:52:17,810 --> 01:52:19,810
Okay, let's slow down a little bit.

2275
01:52:19,810 --> 01:52:21,810
They're making mistakes, they're pushing up. One on car, one Dean.

2276
01:52:21,810 --> 01:52:25,010
That fucking cheeky spot.

2277
01:52:25,010 --> 01:52:27,010
Oh, there's another one, there's another one covering him.

2278
01:52:27,010 --> 01:52:30,140
Alright, I gotta wait for you guys.

2279
01:52:30,140 --> 01:52:34,430
It's too much.

2280
01:52:34,430 --> 01:52:36,430
Buddha, it's holding long.

2281
01:52:36,430 --> 01:52:42,380
Oh my goodness.

2282
01:52:42,380 --> 01:52:47,699
Oh, I shot him a

2283
01:52:47,699 --> 01:52:49,699
million times.

2284
01:52:49,699 --> 01:52:53,539
Oh my.

2285
01:52:53,539 --> 01:52:56,670
Where's my

2286
01:52:56,670 --> 01:52:58,670
fucking sensitivity?

2287
01:52:58,670 --> 01:53:01,739
Okay, I just got a knife.

2288
01:53:01,739 --> 01:53:14,220
Emma's dead, he played up.

2289
01:53:14,220 --> 01:53:16,220
I can't even leave.

2290
01:53:16,220 --> 01:53:18,909
I can't do anything.

2291
01:53:18,909 --> 01:53:20,909
I need help on B.

2292
01:53:20,909 --> 01:53:22,909
We can make this happen, we can make this happen right now.

2293
01:53:22,909 --> 01:53:26,539
Got one.

2294
01:53:26,539 --> 01:53:28,539
Got another mid.

2295
01:53:28,539 --> 01:53:30,539
He's up in the window.

2296
01:53:30,539 --> 01:53:32,539
Yeah, I'm on site, he's dead.

2297
01:53:32,539 --> 01:53:38,109
I feel like I'm in times two speed.

2298
01:53:38,109 --> 01:53:40,109
Oh, he's on site.

2299
01:53:40,109 --> 01:53:48,220
I got him, I got him. Got another.

2300
01:53:48,220 --> 01:53:50,220
Let's get this site, this is ours.

2301
01:53:50,220 --> 01:53:52,220
Dean, prone, prone, prone.

2302
01:53:52,220 --> 01:53:56,829
Get it, get it, get it, get it.

2303
01:53:56,829 --> 01:53:59,260
We're doing good.

2304
01:53:59,260 --> 01:54:01,260
We take this, we take this.

2305
01:54:01,260 --> 01:54:03,260
He's right behind the sign.

2306
01:54:03,260 --> 01:54:06,020
He's like right behind the sign.

2307
01:54:06,020 --> 01:54:10,500
What the fuck?

2308
01:54:10,500 --> 01:54:15,619
He's down, he's down, he's down.

2309
01:54:15,619 --> 01:54:19,140
I'm prone, I'm prone.

2310
01:54:19,140 --> 01:54:21,140
We need to push past the band.

2311
01:54:21,140 --> 01:54:23,140
On this next respawn, let's try all going left.

2312
01:54:23,140 --> 01:54:27,680
What the fuck?

2313
01:54:27,680 --> 01:54:29,680
How do I lower this?

2314
01:54:29,680 --> 01:54:32,670
There you go, let's all try taking left.

2315
01:54:32,670 --> 01:54:34,670
Symphony's in our spawn, being a fucking rat man.

2316
01:54:34,670 --> 01:54:37,489
So is Blau.

2317
01:54:37,489 --> 01:54:41,710
We're getting spawn cap sword.

2318
01:54:41,710 --> 01:54:47,140
Yeah, they're inside the house.

2319
01:54:47,140 --> 01:54:49,140
You think they're close enough

2320
01:54:49,140 --> 01:54:51,140
for us to flip,

2321
01:54:51,140 --> 01:54:53,140
but we're not.

2322
01:54:53,140 --> 01:54:59,600
No, they're holding it real good.

2323
01:54:59,600 --> 01:55:01,600
Killed one, killed three.

2324
01:55:01,600 --> 01:55:03,600
Inside trailer, trailer, trailer, trailer.

2325
01:55:03,600 --> 01:55:05,600
Outside of trailer now.

2326
01:55:05,600 --> 01:55:08,539
Oh, John, I forgot about you

2327
01:55:08,539 --> 01:55:10,539
and the fact that you're only playing one fucking corner

2328
01:55:10,539 --> 01:55:12,539
because you're a fucking bitch.

2329
01:55:12,539 --> 01:55:18,420
I'm inside.

2330
01:55:18,420 --> 01:55:22,000
No, the sensitivity is too low.

2331
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:24,239
Good push, good push, Syke.

2332
01:55:24,239 --> 01:55:29,279
We're good, we're good.

2333
01:55:29,279 --> 01:55:31,279
I'm getting B right now, I'm getting B.

2334
01:55:31,279 --> 01:55:33,279
We got it, let's hold it down.

2335
01:55:33,279 --> 01:55:45,250
Hold it, hold it, hold it.

2336
01:55:45,250 --> 01:55:48,300
Where?

2337
01:55:48,300 --> 01:55:51,310
Outside, running out mid.

2338
01:55:51,310 --> 01:55:54,899
Oh my god.

2339
01:55:54,899 --> 01:56:04,750
I got trailer, I got trailer.

2340
01:56:04,750 --> 01:56:09,420
Is it too late?

2341
01:56:09,420 --> 01:56:11,420
Fuck man.

2342
01:56:11,420 --> 01:56:13,420
Bro, they're on C.

2343
01:56:20,529 --> 01:56:22,529
Is there one more round, or are we done?

2344
01:56:22,529 --> 01:56:24,529
We lost this game?

2345
01:56:24,529 --> 01:56:26,529
Two series, yeah.

2346
01:56:26,529 --> 01:56:28,770
It was a good try, good try.

2347
01:56:28,770 --> 01:56:38,739
It's a hard game.

2348
01:56:38,739 --> 01:56:40,739
Yeah, especially on Nook Town.

2349
01:56:40,739 --> 01:56:45,340
E.G.'s though, guys.

2350
01:56:45,340 --> 01:56:47,340
We did pretty decent-ish.

2351
01:56:54,880 --> 01:56:59,489
I think it crashed.

2352
01:56:59,489 --> 01:57:04,979
No, that was fun.

2353
01:57:04,979 --> 01:57:06,979
I have this problem with Call of Duty

2354
01:57:06,979 --> 01:57:09,279
where I feel like, I'm actually crashing.

2355
01:57:09,279 --> 01:57:11,279
I feel like the game is in like times five

2356
01:57:11,279 --> 01:57:13,710
speed sometimes.

2357
01:57:13,710 --> 01:57:15,710
It's like, I have two times

2358
01:57:15,710 --> 01:57:18,340
speed on a YouTube video, and I'm just like

2359
01:57:18,340 --> 01:57:20,340
where do I, I don't even know where my eyes are supposed to go.

2360
01:57:20,340 --> 01:57:22,829
This way, oh, oh, oh, oh.

2361
01:57:22,829 --> 01:57:26,220
I'm dead. It's such a, yeah,

2362
01:57:26,220 --> 01:57:29,869
it's a crazy fucking game.

2363
01:57:29,869 --> 01:57:31,869
Your sensitivity is 5x.

2364
01:57:31,869 --> 01:57:40,189
I'm on 1.0 sensitivity.

2365
01:57:40,189 --> 01:57:42,189
Yeah, thanks for setting it up.

2366
01:57:42,189 --> 01:57:44,189
That was fun.

2367
01:57:44,189 --> 01:57:46,189
That was a blast.

2368
01:57:46,189 --> 01:57:48,189
That was really fun.

2369
01:57:48,189 --> 01:57:50,189
Let's do it again, it was really fun.

2370
01:57:50,189 --> 01:57:52,189
I actually enjoyed it. Yeah, GG's everybody.

2371
01:57:52,189 --> 01:57:54,189
GG's. GG's.

2372
01:57:54,189 --> 01:57:56,189
GG's.

2373
01:57:56,189 --> 01:57:58,189
Bye-bye.

2374
01:57:58,189 --> 01:58:04,340
See you guys later.

2375
01:58:04,340 --> 01:58:14,180
Shit! I was a bottom bragger!

2376
01:58:14,180 --> 01:58:16,670
No, that was fun, that was fun.

2377
01:58:16,670 --> 01:58:18,670
I'm not a good Call of Duty player, but that was fun.

2378
01:58:18,670 --> 01:58:20,670
Sometimes you gotta play COD.

2379
01:58:20,670 --> 01:58:24,960
Do zombies? I don't, can you do

2380
01:58:24,960 --> 01:58:28,989
zombies through plutonium? No, I have

2381
01:58:28,989 --> 01:58:42,100
fun. How do I do it?

2382
01:58:42,100 --> 01:58:44,100
Yes, I can. How do you play zombies?

2383
01:58:44,100 --> 01:58:53,739
Do I do it? Is there a different thing I have to do?

2384
01:58:53,739 --> 01:59:01,920
Is it a different launcher?

2385
01:59:01,920 --> 01:59:03,920
I've never played COD zombies, I don't know how it works.

2386
01:59:03,920 --> 01:59:09,020
Really? Can I just play it by myself?

2387
01:59:09,020 --> 01:59:24,449
I did? When did I play?

2388
01:59:24,449 --> 01:59:26,449
Whoa, that didn't work.

2389
01:59:26,449 --> 01:59:29,260
That was a hard crash when I tried to open zombies.

2390
01:59:29,260 --> 01:59:37,970
Good job interacting with others, we're proud of you.

2391
01:59:37,970 --> 01:59:41,729
Hope it was entertaining. I had fun.

2392
01:59:41,729 --> 01:59:44,420
The first game I got a bunch of kills.

2393
01:59:44,420 --> 01:59:52,930
I just get so

2394
01:59:52,930 --> 01:59:57,090
flustered. You know, I need

2395
01:59:57,090 --> 01:59:59,090
a seatbelt. I need a seatbelt on this chair.

2396
01:59:59,090 --> 02:00:01,899
You know what I mean? I need a seatbelt

2397
02:00:01,899 --> 02:00:03,899
and straps here

2398
02:00:03,899 --> 02:00:05,899
on my elbows to keep me here.

2399
02:00:05,899 --> 02:00:08,210
Because every time I go to shoot and I

2400
02:00:08,210 --> 02:00:10,210
miss, I start moving and

2401
02:00:10,210 --> 02:00:12,210
jumping around and like shaking my head.

2402
02:00:12,210 --> 02:00:14,579
I need a seatbelt to make it so I can't

2403
02:00:14,579 --> 02:00:19,119
do that. No, a seatbelt.

2404
02:00:19,119 --> 02:00:23,220
Like you're in a rollercoaster.

2405
02:00:23,220 --> 02:00:25,899
Can you imagine if I had like a thing

2406
02:00:25,899 --> 02:00:31,470
over my shoulders? That'd be so stupid.

2407
02:00:31,470 --> 02:00:34,930
I can't open

2408
02:00:34,930 --> 02:00:40,430
zombies. I just like

2409
02:00:40,430 --> 02:00:47,020
you should play mortuary assistant.

2410
02:00:47,020 --> 02:00:49,579
Should I just go to mortuary assistant?

2411
02:00:49,579 --> 02:00:51,579
How long is it? I don't know for how long I'm going to

2412
02:00:51,579 --> 02:00:59,569
stream for. Should we just do it? Yes.

2413
02:00:59,569 --> 02:01:01,569
It's only a couple hours? Is it only a couple hours?

2414
02:01:01,569 --> 02:01:12,130
It's like an hour or two? Alright, yeah, let's do it.

2415
02:01:12,130 --> 02:01:14,130
Let's go.
