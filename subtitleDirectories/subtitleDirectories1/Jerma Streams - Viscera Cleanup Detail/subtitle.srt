00:00:01,139 --> 00:00:15,529
Hello, welcome to another edition of Jeremy plays something and we go what the fuck today's what the fuck moment is

2
00:00:17,649 --> 00:00:33,929
Vistra cleanup detail. All right that over here stream detective. Yeah, and I'm sorry to say

3
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:43,950
Today is gonna be a short stream. No, no before anybody gets angry. Just what wait, hold on

4
00:00:49,179 --> 00:00:57,969
I need to make sure that the Christmas stream is taken care of I need to get packages ordered

5
00:00:57,969 --> 00:01:04,769
I need to get paper and the people that are involved with the project need to be brought up to speed and

6
00:01:05,569 --> 00:01:09,459
It's a whole ordeal. So to make sure that I can get that going

7
00:01:09,459 --> 00:01:13,340
I've already been doing it kind of today and the day before yesterday

8
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:19,799
So the reason why there's a short stream today is because of the Christmas Eve stream

9
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:27,420
So here I'm gonna give you the plan for the next few days because this is kind of the holiday schedule, right?

10
00:01:28,849 --> 00:01:33,569
I got to go to the doctor tomorrow. So that really has nothing to do with it. But the appointment is

11
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:36,290
In the afternoon, so I can't

12
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:44,219
Stream really and it gives me another day to make sure everything can get done. So one two three

13
00:01:44,299 --> 00:01:49,540
Here's the schedule for this week. Nothing tomorrow stream on Saturday. Nothing on Sunday

14
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:57,549
Christmas Eve stream on the 24th and then two days later, I'll see you again after the holiday

15
00:01:57,549 --> 00:02:05,760
So I'll see you guys probably on like the 26th of the 27th end of the stream voice

16
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,439
already

17
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,000
No, I mean short as in

18
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,280
less than four hours, but more than two, you know, I mean and

19
00:02:18,189 --> 00:02:24,740
to continue to talk about this because of the nature of the packages and

20
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:30,360
The secret Santa chat suggestions, I got to get this shit ordered

21
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:35,780
So well, you really only have another couple hours for any suggestions

22
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:50,939
If you have any suggestions on what you'd like me to open on the Christmas Eve stream

23
00:02:51,259 --> 00:02:55,189
And I'm gonna break down the rules one more time just because I think

24
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:59,949
There are probably plenty of people that may not know what I'm talking about because they literally only brought it up yesterday

25
00:03:00,509 --> 00:03:05,430
So Christmas Eve, I'm gonna be opening up presents from you guys

26
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:11,430
But I'm going to be buying them. I'm not gonna be buying them a third party will be purchasing them

27
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:14,330
I don't know what they're gonna be

28
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:23,000
I don't know what they are your suggestions in that just is the discord channel by the way only up to three suggestions per person

29
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:28,360
Nope, nobody buy it. You don't buy anything. You just give an Amazon link that has a primable

30
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:34,759
Shipping and the mods are going to determine if that would be fun to open or if that would be something that they would want

31
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:47,819
Put on the list up to $50 per suggestion. No more than that. No live animals. No sexual stuff

32
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:59,210
No perishable items. They're your criteria. So no, you're not gonna it's not gonna happen. That's why the mods are

33
00:04:00,009 --> 00:04:06,280
Responsible for selecting what they determine to be worth opening. I guess

34
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:15,960
Basically everything hold on. So this so nothing exists. Nothing in the world exists besides bugs

35
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,029
rats like dildos and

36
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:38,730
Like sandwiches, are you sure are you sure about this? Nothing else in the world exists. There's no other items. Anyways

37
00:04:40,149 --> 00:04:42,149
We're gonna play this or clean up detail

38
00:04:42,189 --> 00:04:46,389
Forget it's a just chill game to relax and hang out and play for a few hours

39
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:51,420
Well, then I figure out how I'm gonna get this whole thing put together for Christmas Eve

40
00:04:51,899 --> 00:05:01,420
So let's just get over there. What do you say that up should already be

41
00:05:02,889 --> 00:05:10,290
Captured. Hey, I think it is. This is not Shrek that I didn't say we were gonna play Shrek immediately

42
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:14,089
I never said that Shrek was gonna be played immediately

43
00:05:15,009 --> 00:05:17,269
Shrek is is

44
00:05:17,269 --> 00:05:19,269
Why the fuck did I say that last night?

45
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:28,459
why did I say I was gonna play Shrek last night the one where explicitly he talks about a

46
00:05:30,939 --> 00:05:32,939
Certain thing a certain

47
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:36,379
sexual

48
00:05:36,379 --> 00:05:37,579
thing

49
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:40,740
The first sentence of the game and I'm gonna play that on stream

50
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:43,300

Is this person still alive?

95
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:31,740
Okay, how do I pick him up? That's not how you pick people up. That's not how you pick people up

I know but I don't know how at least like at least five one guys told me to do the tutorial

All right, I got it. Oh now I'm on fire. I need to get a bucket of water

113
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:41,830
This shit is so dirty now. I think where's the water? I need a bucket of water. Where do I get a bucket of water?

114
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:59,620
What is this? All right, I gotta find water. Do I have like a water? Can I like order it from my fucking menu?

115
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:01,379

125
00:15:37,059 --> 00:15:42,940
I feel like you guys are just making me do that. I'm not supposed to be doing that. Just put everything in the fire

126
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:56,740
Okay, everything can go on the fire. That's how you clean the whole house. Okay

127
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:03,149
This is dirty. What do you do with the dirty shit?

128
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:24,759
Okay, I need another one. All right, get out here. Oh and knocked it over. No, I want to give you it

00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:42,490
All right, come here right here now. It's clean now. I'm tracking footprints everywhere

130
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:44,490
Is this why everyone told me to turn it off?

131
00:16:44,529 --> 00:16:47,100
How do I clean my feet?

132
00:16:47,100 --> 00:17:06,930
How do I cook? Okay. All right. I got it clean them. Okay

133
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:12,769
Wait, what's that? What do I do with these?

134
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:36,000
Can I get like a wastebasket? How do I get like a trash can? This is is a trash can don't like don't tell me

135
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:50,319
It's not it just has water in it. Okay. What's this ice cold?

136
00:17:50,839 --> 00:18:07,500
Is this playing music? How do I make it change songs? How do I make this change music?

137
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:36,230
All right, I need to turn this music off. All right, here we go

138
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:49,619
Set it on a safe place. Is there how can I rotate something? All right, how do I rotate?

139
00:18:50,259 --> 00:18:53,900
All right, how do I press the button?

140
00:18:54,059 --> 00:18:59,200
E

141
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:22,630
Hold left click the screen. Ah, I got it. Okay. All right, stop. I gotta clean

142
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:37,019
There's a cursor. Oh

143
00:19:37,099 --> 00:19:44,930
What the this is so tiny. I didn't see the cursor. I thought I had to press the button with my finger

144
00:19:45,470 --> 00:20:04,579
No, they all start the same way. All right whiskey and a shotgun. Sure. All right, give me my where's it?

145
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:11,920
All right. Let me I gotta go. I'm gonna go corner. That's how you clean a real house. You go corner to corner

146
00:20:16,029 --> 00:20:20,819
And you got to bring the bucket with you so you don't get it anywhere. All right, I'm gonna go corner to corner

147
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:23,059
Start in this corner

148
00:20:23,059 --> 00:20:28,220
Sorry

149
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:32,700
Make sure it's all clean in one corner

150
00:20:33,019 --> 00:20:39,890
Watch your feet. This is the tactic because then you don't step in where you've already cleaned

151
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:51,569
And you don't have to worry about anything else. So I didn't know you could do that

152
00:20:55,859 --> 00:21:00,730
Presence are fine, right? I don't have to get is part of the cleaning. How do I get that?

153
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:19,390
How the fuck do I get the kite up on the on the ceiling god, what do you mean gun?

154
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:30,470
What am I supposed to do with the gun? I can't use it the FOV. It should be 90 when we turn it up

155
00:21:34,019 --> 00:21:35,299
95

156
00:21:35,299 --> 00:21:42,019
Anything over like an 100 is puke inducing. All right, so this corner is done

157
00:21:42,539 --> 00:22:00,119
Wait, not quite. What's that thing? What a load disposal bins. Ooh, wait, how do I get one? So this is where trash goes

158
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:30,369
All right, how much what do I do with this afterwards? I have to throw that in the fire afterwards. Oh bullshit. No, I don't

159
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:45,910
Okay, make sure how do I see? How do I stand it back up?

160
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:49,650
Shift how do I turn it?

161
00:22:52,750 --> 00:23:22,950
Turn this I got it. Okay, so you can't just smash into stuff. I get it. God. Oh, okay

162
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:33,880
I can hold left click and just turn it on easy. All right. Can I get the fuck out of this corner? I

163
00:23:34,359 --> 00:23:43,470
Almost got the okay. Remember the technique is corner to corner. I have to be careful

164
00:23:44,029 --> 00:23:59,750
Alright, so I have to put these in here. Is that the do I get more points if I do it like this in footprints?

165
00:23:59,829 --> 00:24:13,720
There's nothing even in here. This is dirty. No, it's not. What's the what are the shells coming from?

166
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:18,200
Why does this thing have this thing's on a shotgun? Oh, never mind. It fell out before. Okay, here we go

167
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:34,569
Don't step in any blood. I gotta get to the front. This is fun

168
00:24:34,569 --> 00:24:39,269
What if this is kind of like a house flipper, but you don't flip the house. You just clean it up

169
00:24:39,970 --> 00:24:50,650
This is fun. What was this something wrong with how I said that?

170
00:24:51,309 --> 00:24:59,759
You don't think this is fun. I think this is fun. It's fun. Can you do my house next?

171
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:06,529
I don't even want to answer that because I don't think I'm good enough

172
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:12,140
You know, I mean, I'm not sure you want me there

173
00:25:12,819 --> 00:25:15,559
It'll take me like six hours to clean one room in your house

174
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:20,609
All right. What else is in here? All right. Well, that's pretty brutal

175
00:25:21,609 --> 00:25:37,619
Happy Christmas. So these are as if that doesn't do it. I

176
00:25:50,609 --> 00:25:56,220
Call it another janitor. Yeah, too

177
00:26:00,599 --> 00:26:02,599
Okay, so age 19

178
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:10,799
Careless work ethic of your predecessor led to their death shaving the company required that you is a substitute this opening immediately

179
00:26:13,049 --> 00:26:16,289
Perform your duties in accordance with the company guidelines and regulations

180
00:26:16,690 --> 00:26:20,670
Or be replaced your parts will be valid. Why would somebody do that?

181
00:26:21,049 --> 00:26:30,519
I'm gonna just take fucking live dynamite throw it into a fire and does it work is my last words. Oh

182
00:26:32,339 --> 00:26:34,339
Fuck okay

183
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:44,039

184
00:26:46,579 --> 00:26:57,799
Hold on I want to like do it again though. I'm gonna get a good distance. Fuck it. Let's go ready

185
00:26:58,359 --> 00:27:00,660

00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:03,099

187
00:27:03,099 --> 00:27:11,880
What was that? There was another explosion. Oh, no, what?

188
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:18,490
What was the other explosion?

189
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:22,910
No

190
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:27,140
What was the other explosion?

191
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:49,049
This is cleaning up haven't even seen game of Thrones fire. Oh fuck

192
00:27:50,009 --> 00:27:55,000
This is the I'm cleaning

193
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:18,599
Give it to me. I want it. Okay, so I did it so now I have to have to restart the level

194
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:35,160
Do I have to do I have to restart the level? Yep. Yes. No, I could clean it though. Ow. Oh

00:28:54,619 --> 00:28:59,099
What a funny explosion stream. No now that's over

197
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:08,619
Alright, I'm gonna know. I know I don't get to go back. Did you see that buddy explosion?

198
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:11,539
Ah

199
00:29:11,539 --> 00:29:17,279
Okay, let's like all cleaning techniques. You gotta start in the corner

200
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:40,509
Give me this. I need a mop up here two hours average. I

00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:54,000
I didn't even give it a real chance before but what if this is fun? I feel like I'm a comp was this

203
00:29:54,640 --> 00:30:06,460

Okay, that's fine. Let me take care of this first. Oh

00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:53,259
Whoa

207
00:30:53,259 --> 00:30:54,980

Then I'm gonna dump this in the means in the so this is kind of like bagging leaves, right?

Don't tip it over. I want the arms you then you go dump the leaves where is that a person inside it is

Tip joke incoming. No, it is not

211
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:36,990
I need to get it all concentrated in the same place and then I can deal with it. So that's it

212
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:53,730
No, there's a couple more pieces in here. Come on. Get it. They're like a crouch. What the hell? Well, I

214
00:31:59,549 --> 00:32:14,339
No, I'm getting them in a concentrated location because then I can dump them because I don't want to have to come back up here

215
00:32:14,339 --> 00:32:16,579
for bodies, right so

216
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:19,420
Only one more

217
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:36,099
All right. This is the last body here. All right. Here we go. Is this too heavy?

218
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:49,019
Slow slow slow. What the fuck did I just walk over? I don't even know what happened. I went over a speed bump

219
00:32:49,019 --> 00:33:06,890

00:34:38,130 --> 00:34:45,150
What about the flash drives? I need another

227
00:34:45,989 --> 00:34:51,239
This is gonna take forever. No, it's not

228
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:57,059
No, how about this? I'm not gonna turn the stream off until this is clean

229
00:34:57,380 --> 00:35:05,429
You understand this is gonna be a short stream, but I don't know

230
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,800
Might be longer than that now

231
00:35:09,159 --> 00:35:20,449
Okay, I gotta get the blood up there. I gotta make this orderly too. All right, this is dirty

232

Well, I gotta get rid of this. I can put it back here, right and then

233
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:40,630
What came what is that? Why did an arm come out?

234
00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:48,119
Do I just burn these?

235
00:35:48,159 --> 00:35:59,079
You just burn everything I didn't I thought I like could put it up there in and exchange it for a new one

236
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:04,320
Okay, that's fine

237
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,519
I'll deal with that one later

00:36:06,519 --> 00:36:28,619
No footprints. Okay, it's so dirty up here. All right now, let's

239
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:31,900

00:36:55,380 --> 00:37:03,519
I'm never making another joke ever again. I don't know that

243
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,440
That guy clips through the wall

Can he honestly not see the USB sticks? Yeah, but what am I?

245

So what about them? What do you want me to do with these?

00:41:55,730 --> 00:42:05,340
Gotta put the presence back up on the table because actually no no, it's dirty. So let me ask this one more time

272
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:16,099
Do I need to throw the presence away or do I keep the presence where they are, you know I'm saying keep them

273
00:42:16,099 --> 00:42:22,059
Okay, so it looks nice. Why would I I don't know because I don't know they might be bodies in there

274
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:29,349
Just Santa. I was good this year. So I want a pony and a bike and a new clarinet. Okay. Well, this is not incriminating

275
00:42:29,789 --> 00:42:50,019
We need to save all the incriminating one Santa my parents say I was good

276
00:42:50,019 --> 00:42:52,380
So I could write to you and ask for stuff

277
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:57,619
So I want the new super turbo jet racer car with all the extras. Also, I want lots of chocolate and the y-pad

278
00:42:57,619 --> 00:43:20,550
Oh my god, that hit me right in the face. Okay. Now we're gonna make the presents look nice

279
00:43:20,550 --> 00:43:35,610
I don't okay. I gotta stack these in a nice way. No, I gotta sit you in the corner over here

280
00:43:35,889 --> 00:44:17,139
Whatever. Okay, set these back up presents back on the table. All the blood is gone. Is there any blood underneath?

281
00:44:17,139 --> 00:44:24,679
I don't think there is it's a little bit. Is that blood? No, it's a shadow from the gun. Okay, not bad. Wait

282
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:42,809
Okay, take a look at that nice and clean we just need to take this stuff down here to throw it into the

283
00:44:43,530 --> 00:44:45,170
fire trash

284
00:44:45,170 --> 00:45:08,369
Use the sniffer. What is this thing trying to tell me? Uh, what does it mean?

285
00:45:08,809 --> 00:45:55,420
What I mean is there I need the wood planks to go over that hole. Are you sure?

286
00:45:55,420 --> 00:46:10,969
Uh, is the guns hold on still it's I want to test something here. It is the gun

287
00:46:19,099 --> 00:46:25,099
It's detecting all the blood below me. Okay. No, no, no, we're fine. There's blood on the ceiling

288
00:46:25,579 --> 00:46:46,170
Put it put it. I'm not even gonna say what you just said. All right, this is done. What is that? Oh, all right

289
00:46:46,170 --> 00:46:59,110
I don't want to make sure I don't track any steps. Come here one detects blood and gore the other detects trash

290
00:46:59,110 --> 00:47:04,920
Okay, I feel like I kind of need to get close to being clean because I mean I will I am

291
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:11,440
Have you detecting anything in the room? So I need to clean this up first and then walk around with the ectoplasm gun

292
00:47:11,579 --> 00:47:37,730
This is dirty people are asking. Why am I doing? Wait, does that work? Hold on a second. Does that work?

293
00:47:38,650 --> 00:48:03,789
No, it doesn't get what are you giving me? I don't want this. Why is it cooking food for me?

294
00:48:03,789 --> 00:48:09,710
I don't want like a fucking filet mignon. Give me a what are you giving these to me for? Why is this here? No

295
00:48:10,309 --> 00:48:36,960
Why did it spawn die? This is the water hole. What that's supposed to get water buckets out of that thing

296
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:46,199
Put the dynamite in the water. I didn't have any buckets of water

297
00:48:46,199 --> 00:48:47,559
That's why I was calling for them

298
00:48:47,559 --> 00:48:50,800
I thought you could dump the buckets of water onto the ground to make the ground clean

299
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:58,610
All right, the careless of the janitor for the careless with like an ethic of your predecessor. Let it at death. Yeah, it's a shame

300
00:48:58,969 --> 00:49:08,699
Okay, let's hope I don't get a fucking with a dynamite in the water machine

301
00:49:09,219 --> 00:49:12,269
No, just more fucking stakes

302
00:49:12,909 --> 00:49:18,800
Why are you doing this?

303
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:25,539
Can I get a bucket of fucking water?

304
00:49:26,219 --> 00:49:31,829
All right, get off

305
00:49:32,349 --> 00:49:35,360
No, I don't want more water

306
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:38,980
Give me

307
00:49:38,980 --> 00:50:00,179
Okay looks pretty good so far get this shit out of here. My computer's like running. Oh, I need that. I need that

308
00:50:00,780 --> 00:50:19,179
This is how you get extra points, right? Two steps forward. Oh what there was no blood in there

309
00:50:19,179 --> 00:50:25,630
I was gonna say two steps forward ten steps backwards speaking of steps

310
00:50:33,110 --> 00:50:35,789
Ruining everything and I like throw this in the air

311
00:50:46,239 --> 00:50:54,440
Not smashed all that needs to happen is I need to get real close to pick this up and the hand has to fucking

312
00:50:54,440 --> 00:51:20,179
Grab me. I don't think I'm getting this ever. No, yes, I am. Let's clear the stairs off. All right

313
00:51:20,980 --> 00:51:25,059
More water, please. Oh

314
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:27,460
Like a brain matter

315
00:51:27,780 --> 00:51:39,199
Water what the fuck is going on? How do you even produce this?

316
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:50,070
No, now that is dirty the water fuck am I doing something wrong?

317
00:51:54,019 --> 00:52:02,039
Finally, the machine is dirty. Well, how would that explain why there's dynamite in the machine?

318
00:52:03,019 --> 00:52:18,159
Fucking god, damn it. It's fine. There's still what yeah that machines real dirty. That's why it's spawning

319
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:28,840
Dynamite. All right. Here we go. Oh, this is really dirty

320
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:33,139
Cool. This is oh, this is dirty

321
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:47,480
And you put on the ceiling. It's not spawning dynamite. What am I talking about? You didn't see the explosion

322
00:52:48,119 --> 00:52:55,550
All right upstairs is done. It only took like two hours

323
00:52:56,269 --> 00:53:07,070
Not the ceiling. Oh fuck

324
00:53:07,710 --> 00:53:27,300
Dammit, okay, make sure I think I got it all what the hell is this trash? All right. I gotta get rid of whoo. I need that

325
00:53:44,449 --> 00:53:49,420
Well, all right, so I'm sorry I didn't know that was gonna turn into a fucking Simon Belmont item

326
00:53:49,679 --> 00:54:04,329
There's a Castlevania. Holy water. I didn't know that was what was gonna happen. I thought it was an LED. All right, the machine is clean

327
00:54:11,380 --> 00:54:14,059
Yeah

328
00:54:14,059 --> 00:54:32,559
I'm gonna clean the machine and then let's see if your guys theory is correct. Okay machine is now clean

329
00:54:33,159 --> 00:54:43,219
Whatever fuck. Okay. I have a clean machine

330
00:54:43,820 --> 00:54:47,460
Now, let's see if if I get more body parts

331
00:54:47,699 --> 00:55:02,519
So it was bullshit doesn't matter if the machines dirty or not that wouldn't produce. Why does it keep getting worse?

332
00:55:02,679 --> 00:55:04,679
Am I getting bad grades or something?

333
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:21,360
Okay back up here. This is done. No more blood on the ceiling pick this shit up

334
00:55:26,670 --> 00:55:27,949
Yeah

335
00:55:27,949 --> 00:55:32,170
Yeah

336
00:55:32,170 --> 00:55:33,369
Okay

337
00:55:33,369 --> 00:55:49,429
Now I didn't need a new I did a new bucket of water. I'm sure you didn't want an arm now

338
00:55:49,429 --> 00:56:01,840
Well, I'm overwhelmed. I'm okay. I'm done. That was fun. I'm just kidding

339
00:56:02,239 --> 00:56:11,579
So what I don't even start I don't know even where to start with this. What are all these buckets doing down here?

340
00:56:11,579 --> 00:56:16,440
Oh, I don't know what to do. This is so much

341
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:22,409
It's so much that it's overwhelming to me corner to corner just like my true strategy

342
00:56:22,849 --> 00:56:29,039
Okay, let's do this. Correct. I'm gonna burn the buckets

343
00:56:29,639 --> 00:56:40,050
I'm starting from scratch. I don't even care what that is. It's just it's in my way

344
00:56:40,690 --> 00:56:43,650
Fuck the stools. I don't I just need space

345
00:56:44,409 --> 00:57:06,949
Get over here. No, I need that nice. It's this too many things in there all presents are gonna have to move into a corner

346
00:57:07,389 --> 00:57:27,610
There's a radio. Yeah, I got ridder. Okay. No, there's more buckets. Can I like put these in here?

347
00:57:28,250 --> 00:57:50,320
What happened? Oh, all right. I get it. I can't so what happens if this goes back in there?

348
00:57:50,320 --> 00:58:03,949
Let me just I'm testing something. Hold on. Does this take the trash as well?

349
00:58:04,389 --> 00:58:26,619
Okay, you have to burn it, but I didn't know if you could fill it and then bring it over there and it like

350
00:58:26,619 --> 00:58:30,139
Oh, thank you. It sucks it back up and empties it without having to dump it into the fire

351
00:58:30,820 --> 00:58:47,849
Okay, here we go. This is new. He's trying to tele-frag himself. I mean not really

352
00:58:47,849 --> 00:58:53,320
I didn't know if there was an in a quicker way to instead of dumping it into the fire

353
00:58:53,900 --> 00:59:05,679
Corner to corner. Let's go. I do need that though. No, so I don't even care what it is

354
00:59:05,679 --> 00:59:08,940
I'm not if it's a present who gives a shit. It's going into the trash

355
00:59:15,650 --> 00:59:28,059
Fuck well, that's to go up there. Perfect about this. This is oh my god. Damn it

356
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:41,719
Nothing fell out. It's so easy just to accidentally. This is just look at this physics thing the game

357
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:45,019
What does this stuck on? On the hat?

358
00:59:45,539 --> 00:59:54,210
Okay, I just it's flat man. Just what am I sitting this on? What's wrong with this? A bullet?

359
00:59:58,489 --> 01:00:00,489
more body

360
01:00:00,849 --> 01:00:01,929
parts

361
01:00:01,929 --> 01:00:15,010
Yeah, I'm sorry that gets caught up in the crosshairs. I don't care if it's a nice candy cane. It's going to the trash

362
01:00:15,530 --> 01:00:20,420
It's not my job to have to worry about what can or can't be thrown away right now

363
01:00:20,860 --> 01:00:40,179
The fuck is this thing? All right body parts in in

364
01:00:40,940 --> 01:00:44,789
In all right, we're pretty we're kind of full

365
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:04,920
All right, I got it

366
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:11,039
So do I leave that in there

367
01:01:11,079 --> 01:01:15,929
Or do I don't understand? Do I leave the incinerator in there or do I have to take it back out?

368
01:01:16,449 --> 01:01:20,219
Just leave it in there. Okay. I didn't know if I was

369
01:01:20,820 --> 01:01:37,329
That's fine. I need another one. All right. Now I need a bucket of water joint

370
01:01:37,969 --> 01:01:42,170
Look at that, you know, if I think I was gonna get anything done today, did you?

371
01:01:42,809 --> 01:02:00,869
Zero progress look at upstairs. I did all of upstairs already. I took care of upstairs. I got started down here

372
01:02:01,309 --> 01:02:05,150
This is how long it would take me to clean an actual house

373
01:02:05,590 --> 01:02:22,269
I'm gonna here's where I'm gonna store all the flash drives over here in this corner one small part of the map in an hour

374
01:02:22,269 --> 01:02:25,219
There's not much left

375
01:02:25,219 --> 01:02:40,980
Fucking footprints. I need more water. All right. I need to how do I reliably dump this in the fire?

376
01:02:40,980 --> 01:02:51,219
I think yeah, I have to just put it in the fire. I can't do anything else with it. All right now I've got a flow

377
01:02:51,820 --> 01:03:02,309
Now I got a fucking flow

378
01:03:02,309 --> 01:03:09,320
This but bought downstairs here is gonna be a breeze

379
01:03:09,840 --> 01:03:13,619
All right, what time is it right now?

380
01:03:13,619 --> 01:03:15,619
I've been streaming for an hour and four minutes. I

381
01:03:16,739 --> 01:03:18,739
guarantee I

382
01:03:18,780 --> 01:03:23,639
100% guarantee that this area down here will be

383
01:03:24,500 --> 01:03:27,500
Immaculate in exactly 20 minutes

384
01:03:28,099 --> 01:03:29,570
Okay

385
01:03:29,570 --> 01:03:36,639
So at exactly one hour and 24 minutes into the stream. It's going to be immaculate down here. Go

386
01:03:37,219 --> 01:03:52,750
Check this out. I got a fucking better idea. I know what I'm gonna do

387
01:03:53,329 --> 01:04:23,309
Watch this. I need like five of these. Okay, that's good for now one more

388
01:04:26,969 --> 01:05:06,739
Here we go. Fuck. I still got it. It's fine. Nice spill joke. No, not everything is a spill joke

389
01:05:07,260 --> 01:05:34,269
Time check I don't need that one. It's fine. I got obviously that's even two minutes

390
01:05:34,769 --> 01:05:53,239
Relax. I got this ten minutes left. No, I have like

391
01:05:54,139 --> 01:06:14,840
Seventeen minutes left that bring this closer. Don't waste any time with the incinerator thing. There's no reason for it

392
01:06:14,840 --> 01:06:33,860
Okay, candy can't get in there all things must go once the blood is gone. It's just a matter of getting three incinerators

393
01:06:42,940 --> 01:06:44,780
Dirt, okay

394
01:06:44,780 --> 01:06:58,300
Getting there. I'm not gonna lie. I would probably sit here with my mouth open and play like the ten hour long level. I

395
01:07:01,070 --> 01:07:02,389
Really would

396
01:07:02,389 --> 01:07:06,070
Is it too early to call this game of the year?

397
01:07:06,590 --> 01:07:11,099
No, no, not too early. It's fucking two weeks till the year's over

398
01:07:11,739 --> 01:07:17,360
You know what? I mean though. Is it do one of this come out like five years ago?

399
01:07:18,059 --> 01:07:34,340
I'm a couple of years too late. Well, can I amend my taxes from two years ago and make sure that I put game of the year?

400
01:07:34,380 --> 01:07:42,460
2015 as visceral cleanup detail. Is that bad? I put that off my taxes

401
01:07:42,980 --> 01:07:53,610
Yeah, that one was on purpose because I thought it was funny

402
01:07:54,130 --> 01:08:04,119
That's just gonna shoot does the gun shoot if it's in there. This is like a cartoon. This is like a cartoon

403
01:08:04,119 --> 01:08:06,119
That's gonna go like

404
01:08:06,159 --> 01:08:09,590
Right

405
01:08:09,590 --> 01:08:11,230
Okay. No, it's not

406
01:08:11,230 --> 01:08:55,170
Where was the blood where the blood come from get rid of the oil? How am I gonna get that? Okay, good clean no blood

407
01:08:55,869 --> 01:09:02,989
little bit of blood

408
01:09:02,989 --> 01:09:08,260
All right, almost there. Oh my god. I got about 14 minutes. Oh

409
01:09:12,680 --> 01:09:34,539

410
01:09:35,140 --> 01:09:47,859

Well, I can assure you I didn't just start. All right, that's enough

How did you not get my fucking god? Give me a break. Fuck the presence. They're not necessary

457
01:18:52,359 --> 01:19:00,510
Just get rid of them. Who cares? It's taking longer to fill this then to

458
01:19:01,689 --> 01:19:43,260
Come on, how much time I have four minutes. I can't even put the fucking presence in there. It's gonna be close

459
01:19:43,500 --> 01:20:17,829
All right. Any more stray stuff around here. Don't you dare fuck that up? Okay, come on. It's so dirty over here. Fuck it

01:20:17,850 --> 01:21:00,109
All right, watch the feet good. Okay, we're almost done. What's left two minutes? Oh

461
01:21:51,380 --> 01:21:56,189
No, there's too many. I need one of those incinerators. Come here

462
01:21:59,819 --> 01:22:29,369
Don't step in the blood. I got like 30 seconds. It's all it's gonna be clean

463
01:22:29,369 --> 01:22:33,350
It's it'll be clean, but there'll still be like some debris, but it'll be clean

464
01:22:33,350 --> 01:22:40,279
It won't be bodies and it won't be blood 20 seconds. Okay, what else is anybody body parts? Okay, hold on

465
01:22:40,439 --> 01:23:00,699
All right, wait 10 seconds 10 seconds 10 9 8

466
01:23:02,279 --> 01:23:07,220
7 6 5 4 3

467
01:23:07,880 --> 01:23:10,180
2

468
01:23:14,699 --> 01:23:23,310
Fuck you game bullshit. I'm so pissed off. I had it. It was close. I

469
01:23:26,260 --> 01:23:29,460
Love this game. Oh, it's so much fun

470
01:23:29,939 --> 01:23:40,350
Okay, it was clean. Look at how clean it was before I fucking panicked. That's pretty close

471
01:23:40,869 --> 01:23:54,579
Let's get a bird's-eye view. Come on forget about see that one right there that one right there that one down there

472
01:23:55,140 --> 01:24:00,020
They weren't there. I had the presence stacked. I just I knocked over the bucket. That was pretty clean

473
01:24:00,460 --> 01:24:18,359
Now I can slow down. I did the whole thing in almost 20 minutes. Come on. I'm not gonna get at least one

474
01:24:18,920 --> 01:24:20,079
Bogjam

475
01:24:20,079 --> 01:24:31,789
You guaranteed and I did do it. I did clean it but I so when the timer went up, it was clean

476
01:24:31,850 --> 01:24:35,170
There was no blood. There was no debris when the timer went up

477
01:24:35,170 --> 01:24:38,649
It was it was fine. But the problem is after the timer when it was clean

478
01:24:38,649 --> 01:24:41,810
I didn't tell you it wasn't gonna be fucked up after the timer goes up

479
01:24:42,170 --> 01:24:45,250
So the timer goes up and I got I knocked over a couple things after the time went up

480
01:24:45,289 --> 01:24:57,500
A few pieces of debris some blood went on the ground. Stop burning Christmas presents. Shut up idiot. Liar. Liar idiot

481
01:24:57,899 --> 01:25:06,979
so why did I hit blackjack like four times in a row with the

482
01:25:07,699 --> 01:25:10,159
the dumb

483
01:25:10,159 --> 01:25:21,289
I was gonna say grenade dynamite. I can't even think I can I not even diddle a simple procedure

484
01:25:21,810 --> 01:25:23,810
Just the timer is up

485
01:25:24,050 --> 01:25:44,180
All right. Now I can just slowly take care of the rest and then we're gonna move on to I don't know

486
01:25:44,380 --> 01:25:48,659
What do I move on to the spill joke isn't funny stop doing it

487
01:25:51,239 --> 01:25:54,600
I got some really really bad news for you

488
01:25:56,350 --> 01:25:58,350
He's not pretending

489
01:26:07,869 --> 01:26:11,909
I just I'm so I don't know. I just bump into stuff

490
01:26:12,510 --> 01:26:20,369
Going a third person. Can you is there a third person mode?

491
01:26:20,369 --> 01:26:27,710
I gotta have set this back up in a proper place in a nice spot right here on the table

492
01:26:28,390 --> 01:26:43,220
That's good. Let's do

493
01:26:43,739 --> 01:26:58,310
My crank in it. All right crank it alt f4 is third person. Is it? Let me try alt f4

494
01:26:58,789 --> 01:27:18,819
Let me very clearly and I'm hitting space to make that. Why would I choose space of all things? So, let me put these

495
01:27:18,819 --> 01:27:20,819
I'm trying. I'm trying to keep track of these

496
01:27:21,140 --> 01:27:29,869
All right

497
01:27:29,869 --> 01:27:33,710
Presence, let's just clean this up wall blood

498
01:27:34,470 --> 01:27:50,569
Fire put that what's still in there. Stop burning everything. I'm not burning everything

499
01:27:51,210 --> 01:27:56,710
Just the things that I don't feel like walking 10 feet to my left or right if I have the urge to

500
01:27:57,390 --> 01:27:59,750
Take a stool and walk it this way. Then I will

501
01:28:00,270 --> 01:28:16,180
Does that boom box have doom OST? It does not I'm pretty certain it does not

502
01:28:16,659 --> 01:28:21,479
No, put this on the table

503
01:28:21,479 --> 01:28:31,840
So I'm just learning right now that if you just left-click it puts it straight like the correct orientation that it was supposed to be

504
01:28:32,399 --> 01:28:43,109
Right. Well, that took me a long time to figure that out put on doom

505
01:28:43,510 --> 01:28:47,970
No, I'm not gonna cave to put the doom soundtrack on

506
01:28:47,970 --> 01:28:53,010
I'm not gonna be the guy that gets pressured to put on doom soundtrack every three streams. I

507
01:28:56,359 --> 01:28:59,760
Want to do like I want to do like color coordination. Oh

508
01:29:00,880 --> 01:29:02,720
That's okay

509
01:29:02,720 --> 01:29:04,720
Fucking immaculate is what this will be

510
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:10,430
Do it vessel. No, I'm not gonna do that

511
01:29:10,430 --> 01:29:16,239
I want to put on the songs that I want to listen to and one of them is this one

512
01:29:16,640 --> 01:29:26,510
Look at how nice that looks over here. No scratch that now. Look at how nice it looks over here

513
01:29:26,949 --> 01:29:35,109
You do it every stream. Well, don't you understand? I don't want to be I don't want to do that. Come on

514
01:29:35,750 --> 01:29:44,680
Don't make me put on the doom OST. I'm gonna have some self-control. I'm not gonna do it. Just put

515
01:29:44,680 --> 01:29:51,710
I'm I don't want to put on that either. I don't want to put on the dancing grandpa six-flags song

516
01:29:51,710 --> 01:30:06,420
All right, what happened to that guy dance? Oh

517
01:30:06,939 --> 01:30:15,960
Probably that guy was supposed to be like a hundred years old. That was like 30 years. That's like 15 years ago

518
01:30:16,439 --> 01:30:21,880
That's too bad. I wish that guy would come back

519
01:30:22,119 --> 01:30:33,579
He was a cool mascot. I know it wasn't an actual as a guy with like a prosthetic face on

520
01:30:34,060 --> 01:30:38,779
Do you think I'm that stupid?

521
01:30:39,500 --> 01:30:49,579
Do you do you do you think what am I some kind of maniac?

522
01:30:55,739 --> 01:31:13,100
All right, look at this mess spill joke incoming no, that would have been a perfect opportunity

523
01:31:13,100 --> 01:31:15,939
You see if I was like, do you think I'm a fucking idiot? Oh

524
01:31:21,539 --> 01:31:28,659
I didn't do it though. That was a perfect opportunity for like the YouTube edit right there

525
01:31:29,100 --> 01:31:35,180
You know I'm saying like I go on that whole rant that whole

526
01:31:35,380 --> 01:31:37,180
Whole

01:31:37,180 --> 01:31:39,180

How did this get up here? What the fuck? He's trying to distract us from the doom. Ost. Is it working?

531
01:32:15,340 --> 01:32:32,140
I'm not gonna play doom. Ost. You gotta have some different you got some variety here

532
01:32:32,739 --> 01:32:35,779
Maybe I'll put something else on but it's you gotta have a little bit of variety here

533
01:32:47,539 --> 01:32:51,220
Katamari I we listen to Katamari already more than once

534
01:32:51,779 --> 01:32:54,489

No, I don't I haven't played persona 5. I don't want to listen to the ost

539
01:33:16,880 --> 01:33:19,079

Yoshi's Island. Ost now, that's a good one. That's something that I can get behind, you know, I can get behind that

544
01:33:52,260 --> 01:34:00,229
Are these sounds too loud or is this fine? Am I being overpowered by the loud noises?

545
01:34:00,750 --> 01:34:14,420
Hold on a second. I don't want to fuck that. Hold on. Let me save the game because that would be bad if something happened here, right?

That song came from Yoshi's Island. That's the stage select and you'll know because here it comes right now

560
01:37:02,850 --> 01:37:06,239

How am I gonna get this person out of here? This is not good. Nothing. I can't do anything about that

You have to enable it. Oh, how do you type audio shit for brains?

620
01:48:11,880 --> 01:48:16,899

Wtf, how does it sit on a stab yak favorite game from snes?

632

633
01:50:50,600 --> 01:50:52,600
He's blinking

634
01:50:52,600 --> 01:50:55,520
He's close

635
01:50:55,520 --> 01:51:01,979
Who got him?

636
01:51:02,380 --> 01:51:14,270
Oh, this level is dm7 believe the mushroom and go dizzy

637
01:51:15,470 --> 01:51:31,479
All right, that's enough

638
01:51:31,479 --> 01:51:33,920
Say germacraft

639
01:51:33,920 --> 01:51:37,289

640
01:52:30,239 --> 01:52:32,239
Stop, it's not a mess

641
01:52:37,069 --> 01:52:43,470
Hello ladies and gentlemen, welcome to episode one of germacraft the terrarium is where I play minecraft now

642
01:52:43,470 --> 01:52:45,470
There's gonna be some food

643
01:52:47,069 --> 01:52:48,590
What

644
01:52:48,590 --> 01:52:50,750
What are you talking about? It's gonna be some food

645
01:52:55,180 --> 01:52:58,140
All right, the text to speech is over. I'm turning it off

646
01:53:00,760 --> 01:53:02,760
I gotta get out of this fucking room

647
01:53:03,880 --> 01:53:05,880
Fucking he oh he swears

648
01:53:07,439 --> 01:53:17,100
What's wrong with me?

649
01:53:17,100 --> 01:53:19,739
No, it's not on there. Why do I think it's on there?

650
01:53:27,760 --> 01:53:30,159
All right, give me the incinerator thing

651
01:53:31,899 --> 01:53:34,859
Give me a new one. I want a clean slate. I don't even know what's in there

652
01:53:39,920 --> 01:53:42,680
This room is done

653
01:53:42,680 --> 01:53:44,680
Let me pull out the

654
01:53:44,840 --> 01:53:46,199
the meter

655
01:53:46,199 --> 01:53:55,149
What is up here?

656
01:53:55,149 --> 01:53:56,590
Oh right there

657
01:53:56,590 --> 01:54:08,720
Is that it? I think it's detecting the shit downstairs

658
01:54:16,460 --> 01:54:24,829
You finally noticed the green poop it's called the sniffer get the names right

659
01:54:25,789 --> 01:54:27,789
All right. I'm gonna move on

660
01:54:28,270 --> 01:54:30,909
This room is pretty much done. I'll figure the rest out later

661
01:54:31,789 --> 01:54:33,310
I need a new bucket

662
01:54:33,310 --> 01:54:37,229
Let's get rid of the old buckets. Wait a minute. That's not a red lamp post

663
01:54:37,949 --> 01:54:45,390
Now it is

664
01:54:45,390 --> 01:54:47,390
End of the stream voice not even close

665
01:55:01,130 --> 01:55:03,609
Oh my god, why am I doing that?

666
01:55:05,680 --> 01:55:07,760
I have the memory of a fucking goldfish

667
01:55:09,500 --> 01:55:12,060
I'm gonna pick this up and put it over here. Okay

668
01:55:12,939 --> 01:55:14,939
That thing no longer exists

669
01:55:20,119 --> 01:55:23,560
Has it been more than five seconds item doesn't exist anymore

670
01:55:24,279 --> 01:55:28,270
Two will be fine. I think

671
01:55:28,270 --> 01:55:45,130
Okay, don't knock that over two will be all right

672
01:55:46,090 --> 01:55:48,090
Now I need to get one of those

673
01:55:48,479 --> 01:55:54,060
trash compactors

674
01:55:54,060 --> 01:55:56,319
What is this?

675
01:55:56,319 --> 01:56:05,529
What is this? You just

676
01:56:05,529 --> 01:56:14,560
This is the bat I think it's the bat

677
01:56:15,520 --> 01:56:18,520
Was there bat in that game? I don't remember who that was. No it

678
01:56:19,319 --> 01:56:22,140
Bowser Jr

679
01:56:40,380 --> 01:56:42,409
A boomer game

680
01:56:42,409 --> 01:56:44,409
How dare you say something like that?

681
01:56:45,319 --> 01:56:47,319
Yoshi's island is

682
01:56:47,640 --> 01:56:59,439
Is is the history of all video games? I need

683
01:57:00,720 --> 01:57:02,720
Oh, what do I need?

684
01:57:04,460 --> 01:57:08,779
This is an achievement that said 28 000 of something. I don't even know what it said, but that's a lot

685
01:57:08,939 --> 01:57:11,100
There's no blood over here. This thing's pretty clean over here

686
01:57:16,590 --> 01:57:18,989
What the fuck happened in here? Did the grenade come in here?

687
01:57:19,869 --> 01:57:29,680
I think so

688
01:57:29,680 --> 01:57:32,960
That's not gonna fit like that. I'm gonna have to do individual pieces of wood

689
01:57:38,409 --> 01:57:40,409
A grenade walked in here

690
01:57:41,880 --> 01:57:43,880
Yeah, so I mean like what the fuck

691
01:57:45,449 --> 01:57:57,739
Get out of my space, man

692
01:57:57,819 --> 01:57:59,819
I need to get this is not gonna happen

693
01:58:00,880 --> 01:58:03,869
It's too clunky

694
01:58:03,869 --> 01:58:11,869
too clunky

695
01:58:12,590 --> 01:58:23,199
Too clunky

696
01:58:23,199 --> 01:58:32,399
How am I gonna get all this out of here? I think I have to make another pile no

697
01:58:33,359 --> 01:58:37,819
Give me the bucket

698
01:58:38,300 --> 01:58:44,619
I think I have an idea

699
01:58:44,619 --> 01:58:53,199
It's kind of that's not a bad idea

700
01:58:53,279 --> 01:58:57,630
Just knock it all in the corner over there

701
01:58:58,270 --> 01:59:14,970
Now that loosened it up. That didn't do anything. I need to hydrate

702
01:59:17,359 --> 01:59:19,359
Um, it's been two hours

703
01:59:20,079 --> 01:59:22,039
I'm all right

704
01:59:22,039 --> 01:59:29,159
I drank I already drank a lot of water. I'm all right

705
01:59:29,800 --> 01:59:33,210
Appreciate the concern

706
01:59:33,210 --> 01:59:35,210
Fuck you. Did that really just happen?

707
01:59:35,210 --> 01:59:41,600
That's mopped up

708
01:59:41,600 --> 01:59:43,600
Nothing else in the corner. I don't think

709
01:59:44,399 --> 01:59:47,899
except for the table

710
01:59:47,899 --> 01:59:50,699
This water is absolutely filthy

711
01:59:53,680 --> 01:59:59,789
Time to get rid of this water

712
01:59:59,789 --> 02:00:01,630
drink drink drink

713
02:00:01,630 --> 02:00:07,079
fine

714
02:00:07,079 --> 02:00:26,720
There's extra like fucking protein cells in there. It's the bonus room where you spin the wheel

715
02:00:27,279 --> 02:00:32,060
Okay

716
02:00:32,060 --> 02:00:43,000
Why do you just have to ruin everything with the meat here?

717
02:00:43,560 --> 02:00:52,350
Is this clown music? I mean it technically is clown music carnival music

718
02:00:54,890 --> 02:00:56,329
Technically

719
02:00:56,329 --> 02:00:58,329
All right. What are we at? We need

720
02:00:58,729 --> 02:01:00,729
I need to get the stools out of the way

721
02:01:01,449 --> 02:01:03,449
No, it's just it's just brush

722
02:01:04,170 --> 02:01:06,409
Pick up the bodies after just it's spelled. You got a brush

723
02:01:07,130 --> 02:01:12,279
Because then I got a clean slate and it's just picking stuff up and moving stuff around

724
02:01:12,840 --> 02:01:20,140
Just don't hit the bodies because it spreads blood like that

725
02:01:20,779 --> 02:01:24,239
Debris is fine. I can just mop around it

726
02:01:24,800 --> 02:01:40,829
Debris and blood is more debris

727
02:01:41,920 --> 02:01:44,239
Now it's time to actually pick shit up off the ground

728
02:01:44,880 --> 02:01:52,619
This is super mario gets the star

729
02:01:53,340 --> 02:01:56,800
I don't know what the fuck it's doing in a yoshi game

730
02:02:02,430 --> 02:02:04,590
All right. I think I can bring in a barrel

731
02:02:09,689 --> 02:02:11,689
Because yoshi is part of the mario universe

732
02:02:12,970 --> 02:02:19,960
Oh, yeah

733
02:02:19,960 --> 02:02:25,050
Nice ad

734
02:02:25,050 --> 02:02:27,770
I can't even see the sour please gift. Yes, I can

735
02:02:28,329 --> 02:02:36,560
I told you my new year's my my new year's resolution is i'm going to download better twitch.tv

736
02:02:41,630 --> 02:02:45,229
These are just too big. I gotta go by themselves. They can't fit in the box

737
02:02:47,439 --> 02:02:51,600
But hey that there's the joke though guys because new year's resolutions you never do them

738
02:02:59,340 --> 02:03:01,739
All right. I think the rest can fit in a box

739
02:03:04,220 --> 02:03:12,890
Yeah, give it to me. This is the final boss, right?

740
02:03:18,779 --> 02:03:20,220
body parts

741
02:03:20,220 --> 02:03:22,220
This is going pretty smooth

742
02:03:30,489 --> 02:03:34,810
These old electric guitar song the sounds that like

743
02:03:39,770 --> 02:03:55,680
You know how long it probably took somebody to find or make that electric guitar sound

744
02:03:56,479 --> 02:04:09,520
Sounds like a mega man

745
02:04:09,520 --> 02:04:11,520
Well, they are from the same era

746
02:04:19,359 --> 02:04:21,840
Not gonna fit but I will try to balance it

747
02:04:22,560 --> 02:04:33,340
Don't have this guy

748
02:04:33,340 --> 02:04:36,489
You know what I mean fortnight they don't have this kind of music in fortnight

749
02:04:37,289 --> 02:04:53,609
Why does everything relate back to fortnight?

750
02:04:54,010 --> 02:05:00,590
Because I believe at this point there are more followers to the fortnight

751
02:05:01,630 --> 02:05:02,670
twitter

752
02:05:02,670 --> 02:05:04,670
Than members of christianity

753
02:05:06,590 --> 02:05:22,909
So, I mean it's pretty relevant

754
02:05:22,970 --> 02:05:25,550
Jesus fortnight. No what i'm saying is

755
02:05:26,779 --> 02:05:28,779
Fortnight has become so big

756
02:05:30,039 --> 02:05:32,039
It's like minecraft times five

757
02:05:43,279 --> 02:05:50,380
How many followers does the fortnight twitter have i'm curious and this is just the twitter account

758
02:05:53,520 --> 02:05:56,720
six and a half million

759
02:05:56,800 --> 02:05:59,199
How many how many people follow christianity?

760
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:01,899
like eight million

761
02:06:01,899 --> 02:06:05,800
four million

762
02:06:05,800 --> 02:06:10,279
It's like it's like probably a billion. Fuck. It's like two billion people

763
02:06:13,800 --> 02:06:15,159
All right

764
02:06:15,159 --> 02:06:18,859
So i'm gonna do a google search is fortnight more popular than christianity

765
02:06:38,329 --> 02:06:40,640
fortnight

766
02:06:40,640 --> 02:06:42,640
Yeah, only 6.5 million people

767
02:06:43,199 --> 02:06:45,840
Follow the twitter, but how many people have installed the game?

768
02:06:49,229 --> 02:06:55,949
Somebody give me some facts on that how many people have installed fortnight. I'm talking across mobile. I'm talking on desktop

769
02:07:08,859 --> 02:07:12,380
over 200 million

770
02:07:12,380 --> 02:07:23,239
Okay. Oh, we've been new ost new ost. Hold on

771
02:07:32,560 --> 02:07:43,390
Chrono trigger, this is a good one. This is a really good one one of my favorite games ever made in case you're curious

772
02:07:58,380 --> 02:08:08,399
Resident sleeper on chrono trigger what chrono trigger is an awesome game

773
02:08:13,479 --> 02:08:16,520
Oh, I mean you that's a real quick way to get fired from chat

774
02:08:32,300 --> 02:08:47,609
Anime game. It's not it's not an anime game. It is what do you mean? It is. Yes. It is. No, it is not

775
02:08:50,960 --> 02:08:56,239
Just because toriyama did the fucking slides doesn't mean that it's an anime game

776
02:09:10,170 --> 02:09:24,109
Fuck that i'm taking up later. All right, i've made no problem. Yeah, I have look at this turn it up my pleasure

777
02:09:37,289 --> 02:09:43,819
Is something oh no, okay. I thought the game crashed here's a fun fact about chrono trigger and uh a stupid dumb

778
02:09:44,520 --> 02:09:46,489
moronic fact

779
02:09:46,489 --> 02:09:50,970
Uh, they've re-released this game probably twice the amount like probably more than skyrim

780
02:09:52,060 --> 02:09:54,140
Just make another one

781
02:09:54,140 --> 02:09:55,359
Do it

782
02:09:55,359 --> 02:09:57,920
You you had fucking god. Damn it

783
02:09:58,399 --> 02:10:04,170
just make

784
02:10:04,170 --> 02:10:11,050
Just make another one. What's stopping you? You know chrono trigger and chrono cross. They're such everybody loves them

785
02:10:11,529 --> 02:10:14,649
They're like more loved than final fantasy seven

786
02:10:15,770 --> 02:10:18,489
But let's let's bring the final fantasy seven three times

787
02:10:20,909 --> 02:10:23,470
No, no, no, don't do it. There's only been two chrono games

788
02:10:24,279 --> 02:10:26,779
Make another final fantasy

789
02:10:26,859 --> 02:10:28,859
Quick do it rich 17

790
02:10:32,060 --> 02:10:41,979
Oh my

791
02:10:44,510 --> 02:10:48,029
I'm so i'm so flustered right now for a fucking chrono trigger

792
02:10:49,760 --> 02:10:52,159
They had an opportunity. They had it trademarked

793
02:10:53,770 --> 02:10:55,770
But they were like no, you know what oh

794
02:10:57,850 --> 02:11:01,199
Hmm

795
02:11:01,199 --> 02:11:03,199
Okay, I moved it over there. So it is

796
02:11:03,600 --> 02:11:09,920
Chrono for smash

797
02:11:09,920 --> 02:11:15,199
I don't know if that would ever happen. Isn't there a bunch of weird legality around the entire chrono franchise?

798
02:11:15,920 --> 02:11:20,000
Not like five people tied to its inception and like that's why it's impossible to do anything with it

799
02:11:20,640 --> 02:11:23,920
Just think this one's fine. What's wrong with this one? Nothing. Whatever

800
02:11:33,880 --> 02:11:35,399
they made

801
02:11:35,399 --> 02:11:38,279
Yeah, they yeah, they made fortnight instead of uh chrono break

802
02:11:41,159 --> 02:11:43,159
Chrono cross was messy

803
02:11:44,680 --> 02:11:46,680
But it was still a great game

804
02:11:48,479 --> 02:11:50,479
You wanted something crazy about chrono cross

805
02:11:50,720 --> 02:11:52,720
Why that game was so fucking cool?

806
02:11:52,960 --> 02:11:54,079
they were

807
02:11:54,079 --> 02:11:55,960
40

808
02:11:55,960 --> 02:11:59,960
Playable characters and they're more than I think like 45 playable fucking party characters

809
02:12:02,760 --> 02:12:06,039
That's just I mean, it's it didn't suck. It didn't suck. It was messy

810
02:12:06,840 --> 02:12:08,810
It was messy

811
02:12:08,810 --> 02:12:15,159
But it didn't suck

812
02:12:15,159 --> 02:12:18,760
It really did suck

813
02:12:18,760 --> 02:12:22,840
yeah, but if they had if if chrono break tied the whole series together and they made like a

814
02:12:23,399 --> 02:12:28,119
Bring back like chrono bring back frog or you know, glen spoilers everybody. Sorry

815
02:12:33,210 --> 02:12:37,050
Boomer rose tinted glasses. No, no, no, no, no go play chrono trigger right now

816
02:12:37,609 --> 02:12:41,180
Do it right now close the spring

817
02:12:41,420 --> 02:12:45,100
It's on every platform. Don't worry. You'll find it type in what platform is chrono trigger run for me

818
02:12:45,659 --> 02:12:51,930
Chrono trigger is one of the best games ever made

819
02:12:52,649 --> 02:12:56,170
Just do it right now. It's gonna take you like 30 or 40 hours to do

820
02:12:56,729 --> 02:13:00,029
Put it on your christmas list. Don't worry. I just threw this in the

821
02:13:07,560 --> 02:13:09,880
Stream chrono trigger, I I know I can't

822
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:19,319
Boomer streamer thinks the game he played when he was five is a good game. Oh, you guys have no idea

823
02:13:21,449 --> 02:13:23,529
You have no idea. Come on. Are you serious?

824
02:13:26,350 --> 02:13:30,510
This game is a cloud. The story is wonderful. It was about time travel

825
02:13:31,390 --> 02:13:35,310
And like fucking up the future and fucking up the past. It was oh it was perfect

826
02:13:41,520 --> 02:13:45,380
Anime plot this shit predated anime. This was like 1994

827
02:13:49,100 --> 02:13:53,180
It predated all those terrible netflix original animes guys. Come on

828
02:14:09,439 --> 02:14:13,840
Oh, no, here comes the chat for anime netflix. I mean i'm joking but you know what I mean

829
02:14:20,060 --> 02:14:23,659
Yeah, what animes did we have back in like the 60s and 70s? We had speed racer

830
02:14:25,899 --> 02:14:28,380
And then like dragon ball was made in like 78

831
02:14:30,460 --> 02:14:36,100
And then chrono trigger

832
02:14:36,100 --> 02:14:37,939
the pokemon

833
02:14:37,939 --> 02:14:40,420
And the cura came out and that would mean that was wild

834
02:14:47,310 --> 02:14:49,550
And then minecraft came up and changed everything

835
02:14:54,420 --> 02:14:56,479
Whoa

836
02:14:56,479 --> 02:15:03,119
A new item

837
02:15:03,119 --> 02:15:18,399
What is this? I don't understand what this does. Is this just a better mop? This thing sucks. Am I using this wrong?

838
02:15:31,880 --> 02:15:34,829
Broomer, I know it's a broom

839
02:15:35,569 --> 02:15:39,250
Stop calling me broomer. Did anybody say that or did I just make that up?

840
02:15:39,970 --> 02:15:43,890
I don't know. I'm like i'm having a paranoid moment here

841
02:15:46,560 --> 02:15:53,470
No one said that

842
02:15:53,470 --> 02:15:55,470
All right. I gotta pay attention. I have

843
02:15:55,550 --> 02:16:05,229
He thinks he's streaming again. Jeremy, you gotta wake up. You think you're streaming

844
02:16:14,689 --> 02:16:16,689
Compact broomer

845
02:16:20,340 --> 02:16:25,619
I'm just so clumsy. I don't do this in real life. Just because my video game character has like a fat stomach

846
02:16:26,100 --> 02:16:27,140
Okay

847
02:16:27,140 --> 02:16:31,380
I think this room is pretty much good. Just a little bit more cleanup and we can go down to the basement

848
02:16:34,379 --> 02:16:39,500
Wake up. Jeremy. It's been five years. I mean you I saw you in the other chat doing that a year ago

849
02:16:40,219 --> 02:17:03,420
You know, I think i've seen you in that in another chat doing that. It's part of the dream. That was part of the dream

850
02:17:07,149 --> 02:17:08,909
Get out of my fucking way

851
02:17:08,909 --> 02:17:18,159
Who's the first person to call me a boomer? I really wonder

852
02:17:18,959 --> 02:17:21,729
Who started that?

853
02:17:21,729 --> 02:17:30,159
Yeah

854
02:17:30,159 --> 02:17:47,780
How many tickets did you guys get when you played this level?

855
02:17:57,809 --> 02:18:06,989
Max stack. Yeah, maybe the soundtrack alone will make some of you, uh

856
02:18:11,299 --> 02:18:16,979
No, i'm not gonna keep pushing that i'm not gonna keep pushing like the boomer millennial thing. It's a great game

857
02:18:16,979 --> 02:18:18,579
It's got a great soundtrack

858
02:18:18,579 --> 02:18:22,020
Made by some of the most brilliant minds that are still making games

859
02:18:24,899 --> 02:18:36,780
In the industry somebody said this the soundtrack the soundtrack is very meh

860
02:18:37,340 --> 02:18:58,110
I want that person banned for life

861
02:18:58,110 --> 02:19:00,110
Yeah, if you don't know what a lifetime ban here is

862
02:19:00,940 --> 02:19:14,850
10 seconds the zoom beanie ost is better than this

863
02:19:15,569 --> 02:19:23,709
Are you okay? Is the streamer taking drugs or is the chat member taking drugs? I'm not sure. No, I am sure

864
02:19:23,790 --> 02:19:26,670
I'm not on drugs. So let me you know what I was going with that

865
02:19:40,879 --> 02:19:47,979
Oh my god, god damn it. I don't take any drugs

866
02:19:51,299 --> 02:19:54,340
Unless you count like Tylenol or caffeine

867
02:19:55,649 --> 02:20:10,110
Sometimes this one was perfect. I think it's just music. It makes me really productive

868
02:20:16,209 --> 02:20:18,379
Jenga

869
02:20:18,379 --> 02:20:36,879
Oh, there's the magician inside that uh, little tent area. I don't actually know that this is uh,

870
02:20:36,959 --> 02:20:38,959
This is the robot that you have to beat up for tickets

871
02:20:41,549 --> 02:20:43,549
I love reminiscing about this game

872
02:20:45,459 --> 02:20:46,979
Yeah, it's el gato

873
02:20:46,979 --> 02:20:54,459
I said it's the robot that you beat up for tickets. I know what it is. I've played i've beaten this game 30 times

874
02:20:55,540 --> 02:21:06,049
Is for as many years i've been alive beat it on stream

875
02:21:08,270 --> 02:21:09,870
Maybe I would one day

876
02:21:09,870 --> 02:21:12,030
but turn-based rpgs on twitch

877
02:21:13,180 --> 02:21:17,920
I'm not sure how uh, i'm not sure how people will take that

878
02:21:18,479 --> 02:21:28,690
I feel like it's a very like you got to be like known for that, right?

879
02:21:29,409 --> 02:21:35,729
How many of you guys would want to sit through a me to play a full turn-based 60 hour rpg?

880
02:21:41,329 --> 02:21:44,190
Really sure

881
02:21:44,190 --> 02:21:48,989
Are you guys sure I played octogen for two days and you guys were trying to fucking

882
02:21:50,909 --> 02:22:02,110
scream in my face

883
02:22:09,780 --> 02:22:11,940
Don't octogen was fun. It was

884
02:22:12,739 --> 02:22:14,739
That was a fun little game

885
02:22:19,090 --> 02:22:21,969
All right. I think we're good in here

886
02:22:21,969 --> 02:22:23,969
I'll do a final check later

887
02:22:25,329 --> 02:22:28,690
See any of the blood down to the basement we go after I burn

888
02:22:36,209 --> 02:22:38,370
If people watch fortnight, then people will watch anything

889
02:22:45,649 --> 02:22:47,809
Yeah, but you understand like you guys

890
02:22:48,610 --> 02:22:50,610
Don't want to watch fortnight

891
02:22:50,610 --> 02:22:52,610
Oh god. Damn it. I don't have any water

892
02:22:55,379 --> 02:22:57,379
No, not my gifts. Oh, come on

893
02:22:58,020 --> 02:23:00,020
I just did this room

894
02:23:07,940 --> 02:23:09,940
No, what the hell?

895
02:23:10,420 --> 02:23:18,340
uh

896
02:23:18,340 --> 02:23:22,299
This room is completed

897
02:23:22,299 --> 02:23:27,420
Are you saying we wouldn't watch you play fortnight? Yeah, maybe it's like a joke for an hour

898
02:23:28,979 --> 02:23:30,979
If I turn the stream on tomorrow

899
02:23:31,219 --> 02:23:32,579
Oh, hey guys

900
02:23:32,579 --> 02:23:36,659
So i'm going a different direction with the channel here. I'm gonna be playing fortnight three days a week

901
02:23:38,850 --> 02:23:40,850
75 percent of you would leave

902
02:23:44,450 --> 02:23:46,290
We've already talked about this

903
02:23:46,290 --> 02:23:55,420
You know how many fortnight channels I already exist

904
02:23:56,700 --> 02:23:59,139
What do I bring to the table?

905
02:23:59,139 --> 02:24:03,219
Whoops, I got a headshot in the very beginning. I was player number 97

906
02:24:04,340 --> 02:24:05,299
I'm out

907
02:24:05,299 --> 02:24:08,819
You know, let's do that like 35 40 times

908
02:24:09,540 --> 02:24:16,639
I can't believe this happened

909
02:24:16,639 --> 02:24:25,540
I'm not gonna be better than everybody that plays

910
02:24:26,819 --> 02:24:28,899
I don't i'm not like i'm not into br

911
02:24:29,620 --> 02:24:34,290
It's uh, it doesn't doesn't do it for me

912
02:24:41,360 --> 02:24:43,360
But what how else am I supposed to abbreviate it?

913
02:24:44,000 --> 02:24:46,639
Burr

914
02:24:46,639 --> 02:24:48,000
Royale

915
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:49,360
Battle royale

916
02:24:49,360 --> 02:24:57,600
I guess that's not too hard to say actually never mind. All right, no more

917
02:24:58,159 --> 02:24:59,920
Fucking dynamite

918
02:24:59,920 --> 02:25:18,639
Come here. Come on. All right. Good. No more dynamite, please

919
02:25:20,700 --> 02:25:22,219
fresh bucket

920
02:25:22,219 --> 02:25:28,989
Play fortnight play fortnight play fortnight

921
02:25:30,379 --> 02:25:33,250
I would never play fortnight

922
02:25:33,250 --> 02:25:38,129
I just it's not it's not I know I understand. It's fun. It takes well, I don't know if that's true for me

923
02:25:39,090 --> 02:25:41,440
If you think it's fun, i'm glad you do

924
02:25:41,440 --> 02:25:45,629
But that's I can't I can't play the other games

925
02:25:46,350 --> 02:25:56,209
It's it's actually fun

926
02:25:56,209 --> 02:26:00,770
Hey, you didn't tell wow. Yeah, what a dumb boomer. He can't even make a fucking present bridge. Oh, yeah

927
02:26:13,469 --> 02:26:15,469
Why am I accepting?

928
02:26:15,549 --> 02:26:17,549
That like the boomer word

929
02:26:17,629 --> 02:26:23,059
Why is that? Why am I saying that now? What have you guys done to me?

930
02:26:24,690 --> 02:26:25,870
Okay

931
02:26:25,870 --> 02:26:33,790
We're looking pretty good

932
02:26:33,790 --> 02:26:39,700
All right. So basement it is what is down in the basement? We have that's not gonna take that long

933
02:26:41,299 --> 02:26:46,430
We're getting close to being done a lot of bottles a lot of broken glass don't come down here with bare feet

934
02:26:46,989 --> 02:26:52,049
That's a reindeer

935
02:26:52,209 --> 02:27:03,260
Is that throwing these down here? I don't have a doormat, but this will work, right?

936
02:27:08,620 --> 02:27:10,639
Get off of me

937
02:27:10,639 --> 02:27:12,639
Get off of me

938
02:27:13,840 --> 02:27:19,040
Why?

939
02:27:19,040 --> 02:27:28,819
Okay

940
02:27:28,819 --> 02:27:30,819
Hmm. How am I gonna do this?

941
02:27:34,399 --> 02:27:39,040
I have to bring the trash down there. Forget about the water for now. Give me one of these

942
02:27:43,629 --> 02:27:59,040
Again, do it again

943
02:27:59,040 --> 02:28:00,479
Start from the back

944
02:28:00,479 --> 02:28:05,540
Uh, maybe I should uh, yeah, I want a bucket too. Wait

945
02:28:06,340 --> 02:28:18,719
We don't even need this anymore. It's not playing any music

946
02:28:19,440 --> 02:28:25,389
Am I gonna play classic wow?

947
02:28:27,180 --> 02:28:30,340
I don't think so

948
02:28:30,340 --> 02:28:33,540
I just got big burnout the day the funk died

949
02:28:35,819 --> 02:28:37,819
Oh, it's because I broke the boombox. Okay

950
02:28:37,979 --> 02:28:46,739
We got our own boombox. Don't worry

951
02:28:46,739 --> 02:28:49,139
Okay, would you guys be upset if I played this game way more?

952
02:28:55,540 --> 02:28:56,500
because

953
02:28:56,500 --> 02:29:00,420
I this yeah, I I like this game. I think I want to play it a lot more

954
02:29:07,969 --> 02:29:09,889
It's something very therapeutic

955
02:29:09,889 --> 02:29:14,030
And we could talk about fortnight

956
02:29:14,030 --> 02:29:16,190
That went in my eye that went in my eye

957
02:29:16,829 --> 02:29:19,579
Am I wearing glasses? I hope so

958
02:29:19,739 --> 02:29:26,299
All right. We're gonna put these

959
02:29:26,299 --> 02:29:28,420
up on the stairs

960
02:29:28,420 --> 02:29:30,850
Get them all in the same place. So I don't

961
02:29:31,409 --> 02:29:35,170
view down here

962
02:29:35,170 --> 02:29:38,559
Safety goggles up, please

963
02:29:38,799 --> 02:29:40,799
This is getting kind of full. Let's give it a little shake

964
02:29:41,360 --> 02:30:08,780
Okay, that's better

965
02:30:08,780 --> 02:30:13,840
Because now I can still fit stuff in it

966
02:30:14,000 --> 02:30:16,000
We got a reindeer body

967
02:30:16,000 --> 02:30:18,500
I'm gonna have to shake it another time

968
02:30:23,299 --> 02:30:40,430
There's a battle theme battle theme. All right. I don't want to track dirt. Hold on

969
02:30:52,930 --> 02:31:05,940
Got a lot of glass noises. Ah, it's all right. This is a really weird ride for this guy

970
02:31:10,430 --> 02:31:16,159
Okay, I didn't track any dirt. What are you talking about? We're good. All right. I need another one

971
02:31:16,799 --> 02:31:20,450
Press shift to walk. Oh just like that

973
02:31:24,690 --> 02:31:49,069
What the fuck was that? What the hell happened? What? What the fuck?

974
02:31:49,950 --> 02:31:52,030
Alcohol in the bottles. I thought they were empty

975
02:31:52,510 --> 02:32:40,020
This is uh the castle that's not gonna fit what is it a reindeer head made out of molotovs?

976
02:32:40,180 --> 02:32:48,940
Is that thing gonna be fine? All right anymore reindeer

977
02:32:49,870 --> 02:32:52,850
Antlers. Yeah, I gotta get rid of these. We're not gonna fit the box

978
02:32:53,489 --> 02:33:08,500
I'm making a mess

979
02:33:08,500 --> 02:33:13,299
Well, I have I have to make a mess first down here before I because these are gonna I have to take these one by one

980
02:33:13,700 --> 02:33:15,459
They're not gonna fit in the box

981
02:33:15,459 --> 02:33:19,020
And i'm trying to jump to not track this blood everywhere

982
02:33:19,819 --> 02:33:22,129
Which i'm not this is the last piece

983
02:33:27,809 --> 02:33:30,299
All right, let's get

984
02:33:31,569 --> 02:33:34,909
Thank you for that

985
02:33:34,909 --> 02:33:37,709
I want two buckets

986
02:33:37,709 --> 02:33:42,399
Thanks again. Appreciate it

987
02:33:42,399 --> 02:33:45,329
Thank you

988
02:33:45,329 --> 02:33:50,000
Oh, i'm sorry. I bumped you

989
02:33:50,000 --> 02:33:53,280
Now I need a box and this should be good because i'm gonna do one on either side

990
02:33:54,000 --> 02:33:56,819
I don't even need a box. I got one right here

991
02:33:57,969 --> 02:33:59,969
Where did this come from? When did I bring this down?

992
02:34:00,610 --> 02:34:06,690
Okay, reindeer chunks

993
02:34:06,770 --> 02:34:21,100
Okay

994
02:34:21,100 --> 02:34:24,620
I think that okay, that's already done for me. See

995
02:34:25,500 --> 02:34:27,500
that bucket's already full so we're gonna

996
02:34:28,139 --> 02:34:31,579
Stick with that kind of theory here and just put fill these buckets

997
02:34:32,459 --> 02:34:33,979
and then we have

998
02:34:33,979 --> 02:34:36,059
Smaller amount of things to take up

999
02:34:36,780 --> 02:34:39,729
Let's see if I can stuff him in here

1000
02:34:43,579 --> 02:34:46,540
No, just put him in the big one really fit in the big one

1001
02:35:05,260 --> 02:35:19,760
Upside down get in all right. That's as good as it's gonna get so you can fit in here. What is all this?

1002
02:35:23,920 --> 02:35:25,920
I'm gonna do another run here

1003
02:35:26,479 --> 02:35:29,360
Yeah, take it up

1004
02:35:29,360 --> 02:35:31,360
Yeah, well, I gotta come back

1005
02:35:31,440 --> 02:35:43,860
Give me another one

1006
02:35:43,860 --> 02:35:45,860
I can see the finish line. So can I

1007
02:35:50,659 --> 02:35:53,020
This is a lot

1008
02:35:53,020 --> 02:35:55,819
More fun than I remember it being a long time ago

1009
02:35:57,500 --> 02:36:00,459
That this is i'm having a great time. I really am

1010
02:36:13,329 --> 02:36:19,920
Any of the dangerous stuff up here? No, this one's pretty much done. I will have to i'll go through and check the uh the ecto

1011
02:36:20,479 --> 02:36:21,899
thing

1012
02:36:21,899 --> 02:36:23,899
All right

1013
02:36:27,309 --> 02:36:41,020
I need another box

1014
02:36:41,020 --> 02:36:43,809
Play simpsons hit and run

1015
02:36:43,809 --> 02:36:45,180

02:36:45,180 --> 02:36:46,700
Not now

1017
02:36:46,700 --> 02:36:48,379

1018
02:36:48,379 --> 02:36:57,149
Something okay almost ready for the mop and I get two buckets down here

1019
02:37:00,829 --> 02:37:03,469
Just need to bring up the last bits and pieces

1020
02:37:10,930 --> 02:37:13,379

Why contra?

1024
02:37:36,510 --> 02:37:39,709
So this is it after this I just mop up and make sure everything's done

1025
02:37:39,950 --> 02:37:47,139
What was the estimated play time for this one four or five hours? I did it in like three

1026
02:37:53,219 --> 02:37:54,659
What the fuck?

1027
02:37:54,659 --> 02:38:03,299
Okay, and we just got the little nerf pellets. I gotta bring this over here. It's gonna be paying the ass

1028
02:38:06,819 --> 02:38:14,510
Right there so now i'm gonna I can turn and just be real real clean about it the boss fight

1029
02:38:15,149 --> 02:38:20,909
But not a real boss fight. This is like a a mid-level boss

1030
02:38:27,520 --> 02:38:40,100
Not to be confused with a real boss. You'll know what that is when you hear it really

1031
02:38:50,399 --> 02:39:02,940
Uh, where'd it go? Okay. Well, whatever it's time to stop mopping

1032
02:39:04,219 --> 02:39:09,649
back wall

1033
02:39:09,649 --> 02:39:12,209
This would be so clean. I'm gonna get an a plus

1034
02:39:17,729 --> 02:39:19,329
That one's dirty

1035
02:39:19,329 --> 02:39:26,299
All right. Next one

1036
02:39:26,299 --> 02:39:28,299
This is really bloody down here. It's gonna take a while

1037
02:39:34,979 --> 02:39:37,540
This is a frog song

1038
02:39:37,540 --> 02:39:40,020
Unless you that are curious. Why am I the dj?

1039
02:39:40,659 --> 02:39:43,540
And coming up next we have frog song from uh chronic trigger

1040
02:39:44,340 --> 02:39:46,819
This song played when anytime frog was on the screen

1041
02:39:47,459 --> 02:39:50,610
Coming at you soon here. Uh

1042
02:39:50,610 --> 02:39:52,610
kxw 9 1 1 4 5

1043
02:39:53,569 --> 02:39:56,739
frogs theme

1044
02:39:56,739 --> 02:40:22,639
905.3 the rat you're listening

1045
02:40:30,909 --> 02:40:32,909
Don't spill i'm not gonna spill ready

1046
02:40:34,670 --> 02:40:45,340
Uh-huh

1047
02:40:45,340 --> 02:40:47,340
Hey, look, we won. This is a victory theme

1048
02:40:47,899 --> 02:41:05,040
I need a few of these

1049
02:41:06,319 --> 02:41:10,450
I forgot I had this here. It's all right. I packed it so well then nothing's gonna fall out

1050
02:41:21,069 --> 02:41:25,389
uh fun fact, uh, that was frogs theme turning into uh victory or uh

1051
02:41:27,389 --> 02:42:00,690
Hold on the court. Uh, I need to get everything empty from here. Let's take this because this is just one bucket

1052
02:42:01,569 --> 02:42:24,479
I was holding shift and

1053
02:42:24,879 --> 02:42:28,159
This whole thing is dumping out god give me a break

1054
02:42:28,799 --> 02:42:30,159
Oh

1055
02:42:30,159 --> 02:42:34,719
It's because I was holding shift and I was being careful. I should just fucking walked out

1056
02:42:35,360 --> 02:42:45,379
so if I was doing a speed run, uh speed runners of this game if that just happened would you would that be like a

1057
02:42:46,180 --> 02:42:48,180
fuck reset moment

1058
02:42:56,059 --> 02:42:58,059
And the reset would be really quick too. It would be like

1059
02:42:58,540 --> 02:43:02,989
And they're starting again. It'd be like click click click click click click and do game

1060
02:43:11,010 --> 02:43:24,100
All right. Um, let's get this out of here. I'm walking. I'm not running. I'm walking

1061
02:43:35,680 --> 02:43:38,940
All right, give me another one. Give me another bucket. I want two

1062
02:43:39,819 --> 02:43:41,739
Give me another

1063
02:43:41,739 --> 02:43:45,520
Incinerator

1064
02:43:45,520 --> 02:43:48,399
And I have to use this right now because of this stupid shit here

1065
02:43:48,959 --> 02:43:52,559
They give you the zombie parts. I just want a thing to put people in

1066
02:43:53,200 --> 02:44:10,780
The finish line it is inside. Nobody said that but the finish line is in sight

1067
02:44:13,469 --> 02:44:16,670
Stop the stream. I'm trying to eat

1068
02:44:16,670 --> 02:44:18,670
So good luck with that right now

1069
02:44:18,750 --> 02:44:33,200
still eating

1070
02:44:33,200 --> 02:44:35,360
That was real. I don't know why I'm sorry about that

1071
02:44:36,000 --> 02:44:38,000
I'm sorry

1072
02:44:38,959 --> 02:44:43,139
This just think of it like this this is just barbecue

1073
02:44:44,430 --> 02:44:47,950
See that's barbecue sauce. This is like a nice spare rib

1074
02:44:48,510 --> 02:44:50,989
Well, there's like a chunk of brisket. Just think of it like that

1075
02:44:51,709 --> 02:44:55,260
See, this is spare rib

1076
02:44:55,260 --> 02:45:01,790
Okay off screen like look at it off screen if I told you that this was forget about where we can see the hand right there

1077
02:45:02,350 --> 02:45:07,569
If I told you this was like a nice barbecue spare rib right now. Look at it like right there

1078
02:45:08,290 --> 02:45:15,360
You wouldn't be able to know what if you were vegan? Well, then you wouldn't be eating it. Anyway

1079
02:45:15,600 --> 02:45:29,329
It's the courtroom part two. All right. I fucked this all up because i'll be an idiot

1080
02:45:30,049 --> 02:45:37,979
I'm just in one of those moods today for some reason

1081
02:45:43,469 --> 02:45:45,469
All right, let's take this downstairs

1082
02:45:52,260 --> 02:45:54,370
People are eating

1083
02:45:54,370 --> 02:45:56,690
Well every time there's something gross on the screen. Just look away

1084
02:45:57,569 --> 02:46:12,670
Yeah, can I just put the whole fucking bucket in there?

1085
02:46:18,350 --> 02:46:58,500
All right. Oh, can I stack the buckets in each other? I gotta weigh it down. I'm walking

1086
02:46:58,819 --> 02:47:27,579
Okay, watch out for this watch out for that perfect. All right, let's go back to what I was doing down here

1087
02:47:28,139 --> 02:47:32,159
It's a new bucket of water

1088
02:47:32,159 --> 02:47:34,719
And then I can do the final pass through that's got to go

1089
02:47:36,260 --> 02:47:38,659
That's gonna get me points docked if that stays down here

1090
02:47:44,340 --> 02:47:47,920
Uh, just you stay down here for now

1091
02:47:53,809 --> 02:47:55,809
This is in the future as it happens and get to the future

1092
02:47:56,530 --> 02:48:19,569
All right looks pretty clean back here except the bucket. Okay

1093
02:48:23,440 --> 02:48:24,959
Right, that's there

1094
02:48:24,959 --> 02:48:32,940
Uh, how am I gonna put these in a container to bring up? Is that all the bring this out of here?

1095
02:48:33,020 --> 02:48:34,700
Just put it on the table

1096
02:48:34,700 --> 02:48:57,340
What are you this can go in there too?

1097
02:48:57,659 --> 02:49:13,809
Get another box over here that I don't need actually yeah, I do I need to put the

1098
02:49:14,610 --> 02:49:16,780
Flash drives in there. What's in here?

1099
02:49:17,899 --> 02:49:20,659
Oh, right. Okay

1100
02:49:20,739 --> 02:49:35,340
Uh, i'm gonna get rid of this now that leaves me with this

1101
02:49:36,590 --> 02:49:37,870
to put

1102
02:49:37,870 --> 02:49:41,389
Some small remaining stuff in like these flash drives

1103
02:49:42,110 --> 02:49:45,569
And i'm gonna dump them in front

1104
02:49:45,809 --> 02:49:47,170
the front door

1105
02:49:47,170 --> 02:50:02,399
That's gonna give me some points

1106
02:50:10,209 --> 02:50:12,379
Okay, where's that bucket?

1107
02:50:12,700 --> 02:50:14,620
This is too dirty

1108
02:50:14,700 --> 02:50:16,059
Yeah

1109
02:50:16,059 --> 02:50:21,100
I can't put the bucket in here. Shit. It's so I gotta walk back

1110
02:50:21,819 --> 02:50:29,170
I'll clean it up later. Don't worry

1111
02:50:29,170 --> 02:50:31,170
We're on crunch time here now

1112
02:50:36,829 --> 02:50:39,760
If I spilled this i'm gonna be very upset

1113
02:50:40,479 --> 02:50:45,579
See that doesn't count. It's inside the fire

1114
02:50:47,709 --> 02:50:52,100
What else is down here?

1115
02:50:52,100 --> 02:50:53,809
Okay

1116
02:50:53,809 --> 02:50:55,809
Need to get this out of the way

1117
02:50:56,129 --> 02:50:58,930
There's no more items

1118
02:50:58,930 --> 02:51:10,370
I need a bucket. Hey, look, it's a bucket. I need it right here

1119
02:51:11,090 --> 02:51:21,069
Only the final room is the entryway and then I can clock out

1120
02:51:21,629 --> 02:51:37,950
I'll dump that in there. Just turn it upside down and i'll throw this away

1121
02:51:38,750 --> 02:51:45,709
I can't

1122
02:51:45,709 --> 02:51:47,709
I jumped over it. See? All right, here we go

1123
02:51:57,979 --> 02:51:59,979
Uh, i'm gonna leave that one for trash

1124
02:52:00,540 --> 02:52:02,540
Because they're probably stray trash

1125
02:52:02,860 --> 02:52:31,250
Where's my bucket?

1126
02:52:31,250 --> 02:52:34,000
I did it. I didn't spill it

1127
02:52:34,719 --> 02:52:40,989
Okay

1128
02:52:40,989 --> 02:52:43,950
Down here and then just clean up the blood and that should be it

1129
02:52:44,750 --> 02:52:46,610
And I can do the final room

1130
02:52:46,610 --> 02:52:50,719
Hopefully there's not that much where I need a second bucket, but there probably will be

1131
02:52:51,600 --> 02:52:59,840
It's already getting a little dirty

1132
02:52:59,840 --> 02:53:01,840
Shit, i'm gonna need another bucket. Ah

1133
02:53:02,719 --> 02:53:12,500
Or am I?

1134
02:53:12,500 --> 02:53:14,819
Hmm. It's yeah. Yes, I do

1135
02:53:15,459 --> 02:53:33,899
Give me another bucket. Am I ever gonna play mother of three?

1136
02:53:35,260 --> 02:53:37,020
earthbound two

1137
02:53:37,020 --> 02:53:45,649
Earthbound was mother two, right?

1138
02:53:45,649 --> 02:53:46,610
Uh

1139
02:53:46,610 --> 02:53:50,030
Put this in here

1140
02:53:50,030 --> 02:53:54,770
Oh, by the way, there is I there's dynamite in there. Yep

1141
02:53:55,329 --> 02:53:56,450
Goodbye

1142
02:53:56,450 --> 02:54:01,620
Is that uh, it's not a controlled blast though. What the fuck what?

1143
02:54:05,889 --> 02:54:10,209
On the table I knew there was dynamite in there but the one on the table to the right

1144
02:54:15,540 --> 02:54:18,819
I knew there was dynamite in that one. That's why I did it but I thought

1145
02:54:19,700 --> 02:54:28,590
How are you supposed to get rid of those?

1146
02:54:28,670 --> 02:54:33,149
Script a joke. No, I knew there was dynamite in there. I said it as I was walking up

1147
02:54:33,870 --> 02:54:39,389
But so if you put dynamite in the water, but then what happens when you throw that in the trash?

1148
02:54:40,030 --> 02:54:42,030
Okay, hold on if you put dynamite

1149
02:54:42,270 --> 02:54:46,319
In water and then you put the dynamite into the fire. Doesn't it just blow up?

1150
02:54:47,040 --> 02:55:02,190
Just don't throw it away. No, it doesn't it doesn't no. I knew I put the dynamite in that one

1151
02:55:02,190 --> 02:55:04,190
I just didn't know if it was gonna

1152
02:55:04,270 --> 02:55:06,270
Set off the why am I putting this over here?

1153
02:55:07,069 --> 02:55:12,059
Not a controlled burn in the trash

1154
02:55:12,219 --> 02:55:15,059
Why would that happen?

1155
02:55:15,059 --> 02:55:17,379
No, he fucking scripted it. Oh, it was scripted

1156
02:55:28,959 --> 02:55:31,200
See he knew that was gonna happen and that's why he did it

1157
02:55:33,040 --> 02:55:37,760
Notice the frame notice the frame right before he puts look I froze it here

1158
02:55:38,000 --> 02:55:41,440
Notice the frame right before he walked forward. He glanced to the right a little

1159
02:55:42,000 --> 02:55:45,040
To make sure that he was in line of sight for the other explosion

1160
02:55:45,200 --> 02:55:47,200
And what he did is he then he made sure he was close enough

1161
02:55:47,440 --> 02:55:51,600
And then he stepped a step to his right to make sure he got blown up. I I recorded it and I saw it

1162
02:55:52,770 --> 02:55:53,889

This is the trainer stop. I don't okay. I'm not gonna tell you what another song is

1280
03:07:08,350 --> 03:07:24,079
But I love this song though. It's blood on the door frame. I'll take care of that

1281
03:07:29,299 --> 03:07:48,559
Where I think that's it?

1282
03:07:49,579 --> 03:07:55,920
The other door

1283
03:07:55,920 --> 03:07:58,799
This is not a door

1284
03:07:58,879 --> 03:08:01,920
You should have said the exploded wall door

1285
03:08:06,049 --> 03:08:07,170
Door

1286
03:08:07,170 --> 03:08:10,049
All right. We are close

1287
03:08:10,049 --> 03:08:11,329
so close

1288
03:08:11,329 --> 03:08:13,090
Is only

1289
03:08:13,090 --> 03:08:17,489
Grandpa's study the grandpa. Um, what the fuck is this place?

1290
03:08:18,979 --> 03:08:21,100
I don't know. Watch this

1291
03:08:21,100 --> 03:08:35,620
Molotov cocktail

1292
03:08:35,620 --> 03:08:53,090
No, apparently not the mt. Is that the problem?

1293
03:08:57,950 --> 03:08:59,389
That one's still there

1294
03:08:59,389 --> 03:09:11,969
All right, what can I

1295
03:09:11,969 --> 03:09:16,989
No, it didn't do anything

1296
03:09:16,989 --> 03:09:21,069
That's water in there spaz gave another 10 community subs

1297
03:09:24,719 --> 03:09:27,760
You have to be reaching some kind of extreme level here

1298
03:09:30,690 --> 03:09:32,690
Next slide, please

1299
03:09:32,930 --> 03:09:41,780
I think we're running through like a rough patch right now. Sometimes it happens. It's eggnog. Yeah, but eggnog is

1300
03:09:42,399 --> 03:09:46,770
Alcoholic is it non-alcoholic eggnog?

1301
03:09:49,120 --> 03:09:51,680
But yeah spaz that you've you've given so many

1302
03:09:55,569 --> 03:09:58,909
Yeah, sometimes you get a rough patch. The internet was fixed

1303
03:09:59,309 --> 03:10:00,190
uh

1304
03:10:00,190 --> 03:10:02,690
Like a month or two ago

1305
03:10:03,389 --> 03:10:08,989
But sometimes it still does happen. Sometimes it's a little dip that lasts probably five to ten minutes and then it smooths up

1306
03:10:09,950 --> 03:10:13,840
Usually unless something else went wrong, but I don't think so

1307
03:10:14,479 --> 03:10:14,719
All right

1308
03:10:14,719 --> 03:10:20,719
I want a new playbox 180 and a new y-phone 732 s and the new racer man car driver game

1309
03:10:21,280 --> 03:10:25,840
I also want a new bike because the one I got last year is dirty and I want a new windbreaker air rifle too

1310
03:10:25,840 --> 03:10:38,899
I've been so good and I want these is this eggnog thick and slimy 100 foreign

1311
03:10:39,760 --> 03:10:40,639
uh

1312
03:10:40,639 --> 03:10:42,639
Wonders of pride and I don't understand

1313
03:10:43,280 --> 03:10:45,280
That it's another no alcohol on this

1314
03:10:45,440 --> 03:10:51,899
Happy christmas this year. I want a new

1315
03:10:58,899 --> 03:11:00,180
Dear too long

1316
03:11:00,180 --> 03:11:06,909
I have in my possession video footage of you along with your gang entering one of my premises via the fireplace

1317
03:11:07,229 --> 03:11:13,309
The footage also shows littering and you personally removing my valuable property milk glass and confectionery items

1318
03:11:13,709 --> 03:11:19,149
At present i'm preparing to forward this evidence to the local authorities unless I receive compensation from your organization in the sum of no less than

1319
03:11:19,229 --> 03:11:20,909
100 000 dollars

1320
03:11:20,909 --> 03:11:25,729
I've generously decided to give you until monday to complete this transaction or face the consequences

1321
03:11:26,690 --> 03:11:36,420
Mr. Claus it is with a heavy heart and dwindling pocket that would regret to inform me that you are being sued in the amount of 250 000

1322
03:11:36,420 --> 03:11:41,940
Dollars the claims are as follows destruction of property damages emotional suffering public disturbance and obscenity

1323
03:11:42,739 --> 03:11:47,299
Apparently your reindeer had defecated across a house or houses as they passed by the area

1324
03:11:49,379 --> 03:11:52,500
Where was I keeping these to make sure I had them right here

1325
03:11:53,379 --> 03:12:01,729
Mr. Claus you'll tie greeting for squads and represent a select group of people with great gift-giving ambitions

1326
03:12:04,690 --> 03:12:10,819
Oh boy

What the fuck are these letters?

1331
03:12:22,200 --> 03:12:30,260
It's great regret that I find myself forced to write this correspondence once more as our investigation determine the atrocities conditions

1332
03:12:30,579 --> 03:12:35,780
When you force upon elven brethren must cease immediately the low pay the incredibly long workdays the lack of holidays

1333
03:12:35,860 --> 03:12:40,819
It's inhuman if we go to if we at the union do not see a radical change we'll be forced to pursue legal

1334
03:12:41,459 --> 03:12:44,500
Channels and then sir you shall see the full fury of the elves

1335
03:12:44,819 --> 03:12:52,629

1340
03:13:36,069 --> 03:13:38,319

Where did this come from the painting? That's a poster

1464
03:26:08,129 --> 03:26:27,319
It doesn't do anything

1465
03:26:27,319 --> 03:26:34,549

Thanks for the lie

1474
03:27:14,680 --> 03:27:16,680
If you put it in water

03:27:16,680 --> 03:27:19,159
It won't it's you throw it in the fire and it's fine

1476
03:27:21,059 --> 03:27:23,540
That wasn't just one guy. It was like 40 people

1477
03:27:24,100 --> 03:27:30,930
That was 40 guys

1478
03:27:30,930 --> 03:27:32,530
Keep it in the water

1479
03:27:32,530 --> 03:27:33,569

1484
03:27:57,090 --> 03:28:02,760
Okay, well

03:28:02,760 --> 03:28:06,440
So you're telling me

1486
03:28:06,440 --> 03:28:08,440
See it is now impossible for this to light

1487
03:28:09,600 --> 03:28:11,600
Keep it in the bucket and then put the bucket in the fire

1488
03:28:14,680 --> 03:28:18,709
What the hell was that?

1489
03:28:19,350 --> 03:28:23,319
Did it work?

1490
03:28:23,319 --> 03:28:43,239
It worked. It's gotta stay in the bucket. No, i'm not

1491
03:28:43,959 --> 03:28:47,479
I'm gonna just put the fucking dynamite in a box and put over under the tree

1492
03:28:48,979 --> 03:28:50,979
It fell out of the bucket

1493
03:28:51,860 --> 03:28:54,040
That doesn't matter

1494
03:28:54,040 --> 03:28:56,040
That does not matter at all

1495
03:28:56,120 --> 03:28:58,120
Why did I turn into a broom?

1496
03:28:58,280 --> 03:29:00,280
Where does this broom come from?

1497
03:29:00,899 --> 03:29:04,040
What the hell is this?

1498
03:29:04,040 --> 03:29:10,129
What is that?

1499
03:29:10,129 --> 03:29:21,459
What is this thing?

1500
03:29:21,459 --> 03:29:25,620
Whatever, okay, if there's another stick of dynamite in here i'm gonna be fucking mad. All right, we're good

1501
03:29:26,340 --> 03:29:38,319
Okay, i'm done. I'm I just need to clean up a little bit more. No more random spawns of dynamite

1502
03:29:38,959 --> 03:29:40,959

It's with heavy heart and generally probably that we inform you that you all were being sued. Yeah, whatever

1510
03:30:17,280 --> 03:30:19,280
That joke ran out fucking like a year ago

What

1520
03:31:25,909 --> 03:31:36,020

It wasn't in the right spot. Got to use another one. I don't think so. I ain't gonna get fucking derailed

1541
03:34:22,469 --> 03:34:28,879

03:35:53,879 --> 03:36:32,979
Okay, i'm fucking out of here

1549
03:36:33,139 --> 03:36:40,819
Isn't this secret fucking blow up the door bullshit?

1550
03:36:41,540 --> 03:36:48,159
And now look what you made me do. Oh, all right. I'm done. I'm cleaning up and i'm i'm gonna put the

03:36:48,879 --> 03:36:50,879
SD cards into the slots and then that's it

1552
03:36:51,600 --> 03:36:56,469
That's the oldest trick in the book

1553
03:36:56,850 --> 03:37:01,170
I don't know. This has been out for like a couple years. You guys might know secrets that I don't know

1554
03:37:02,049 --> 03:37:04,879
That's very possible

1555
03:37:04,879 --> 03:37:19,270
All right, we're close

1556
03:37:19,270 --> 03:37:21,090
Why would there be?

1557
03:37:21,090 --> 03:37:25,729
An unlit tnt if there wasn't a secret. Well, because didn't I already blow up the wall already?

1558
03:37:27,590 --> 03:37:29,190
Why would I throw that?

1559
03:37:29,190 --> 03:37:31,190
Why would I throw it like that like immediately?

1560
03:37:32,100 --> 03:37:41,510
All right

1561
03:37:41,510 --> 03:37:43,510
Save the tnt for the santa fight

1562
03:37:44,680 --> 03:37:57,569
That has to be bullshit, right? All right broken bottle

1563
03:37:58,209 --> 03:38:09,270
We're almost done a couple of streaks. I'll take care of that

1564
03:38:09,270 --> 03:38:14,290
Ah

1565
03:38:14,290 --> 03:38:16,290
I don't know why I don't know what that was

1566
03:38:16,370 --> 03:38:25,729
I immediately did not know what I was doing. Oh paintball

1567
03:38:31,809 --> 03:38:35,170
I'm gonna i'm gonna tidy up the place a little bit make it look nicer

1568
03:38:36,209 --> 03:38:42,239
So I get extra points

1569
03:38:42,239 --> 03:38:43,360
All right

1570
03:38:43,360 --> 03:38:50,079
This room is good to go. This is nice and cleaned up presents are up on the table

1571
03:38:50,799 --> 03:38:53,059
down here

1572
03:38:53,059 --> 03:39:05,479
Let's pull out the meter

1573
03:39:05,479 --> 03:39:23,200
How would you not pick this up?

1574
03:39:23,200 --> 03:39:24,879
This one's done

1575
03:39:24,879 --> 03:39:27,959
Wait, wait, wait

Come here come here. I got you

1579
03:41:21,000 --> 03:41:24,440
Elf on the shelf. That's what you guys are referring to. Okay, I get it

1580
03:41:33,329 --> 03:41:44,340
All right, is that it? I think that I think this room is clean. It's a blood on the ceiling

1581
03:41:44,739 --> 03:42:08,159
It can't be clean while you're in it. What was that? I just saw a drip what just dripped. Did you see that? Am I insane?

1582
03:42:08,719 --> 03:42:17,989
Okay, all right done. Take a look perfect clean

Throw dynamite at door is all I hear. I gotta get there's a lot of blood in the ceilings

03:43:06,700 --> 03:43:35,500
I'm not tall enough to do this. How am I gonna get that? Is that even possible to get? I don't think I can get this

1591
03:44:00,709 --> 03:44:24,309

1686
04:13:32,819 --> 04:13:45,360
They just display. Oh, okay. I think that's it. This room looks good. This room is looking better

04:14:04,340 --> 04:14:16,020
Should I just get one of the boxes and just give me a box so I have to keep running back and forth

1689
04:14:16,379 --> 04:14:54,760
All right any stray trash, okay, maybe you should check the ceiling now. See things all right

Everything looks good except for that. There's a present under there, but it's okay

1692
04:15:14,469 --> 04:15:28,219
I mean the sniffer is gonna find the blood. I mean, there's a lot. I gotta dump this first. No, I don't

1693
04:15:28,739 --> 04:15:35,219

Only no, it won't be long now. No, just a few minutes

1713
04:21:06,350 --> 04:21:09,360
And yes, I did say this was gonna be like a three-hour stream

1714
04:21:09,360 --> 04:21:13,979
But I got addicted to the game and it became like this is a lot of fun. I'm definitely gonna be playing this again

Thank you sticks ready to get again for one dollar. I'm watching Seinfeld for the first time today from beginning to end

1818
04:40:40,119 --> 04:40:43,639
I've never really sat down and appreciated it. I love it so far

1819
04:40:44,279 --> 04:40:49,299
Well, I got news for you. If you like Seinfeld if you actually think it's funny

1820
04:40:51,069 --> 04:40:53,240
curb your enthusiasm is

1821
04:40:53,720 --> 04:41:03,540
In my opinion is a superior program. I think that I like Seinfeld. I I don't know

1822
04:41:03,540 --> 04:41:12,689
I don't like the studio audience thing though. I never have but Larry David in curb your enthusiasm is

1823
04:41:13,610 --> 04:41:14,849
especially

1824
04:41:14,849 --> 04:41:17,450
Especially curb your enthusiasm starts off kind of slow

1825
04:41:18,009 --> 04:41:22,090
You're gonna be like, this is not funny. You're gonna watch like the first four episodes and go. I don't like this

1826
04:41:22,090 --> 04:41:24,090
This is stupid. Don't don't do that

1827
04:41:24,569 --> 04:41:32,240
You got seasons like two through eight of curb your enthusiasm is some of the most hilarious television I've probably ever watched

1828
04:41:33,040 --> 04:41:47,979
Every first season of a TV show is weak. I stopped in the first season hypo

1829
04:41:47,979 --> 04:41:52,099
Yeah, but that that's what I mean. The first especially the first couple episodes is just

1830
04:41:52,740 --> 04:41:58,500
Like oh, there's like two guys kind of arguing with each other. That's like the whole episode. Okay. Well that

1831
04:41:59,099 --> 04:42:08,500
This so there's so much more after that first season, especially the first few episodes skip the first season

1832
04:42:08,500 --> 04:42:09,819
No, you can't

1833
04:42:09,819 --> 04:42:13,439
Is it on Amazon Prime?

1834
04:42:13,439 --> 04:42:15,619
No, I think it's on it's on HBO

1835
04:42:15,619 --> 04:42:21,490
If you have HBO now or HBO go if it is on Amazon Prime, that's actually pretty cool

1836
04:42:22,049 --> 04:42:35,939
It is well more reason to just watch it while it's there. It's a great show. Thank you

1837
04:42:37,419 --> 04:42:38,819

1856
04:45:18,979 --> 04:45:23,650

1857
04:45:23,970 --> 04:45:31,080

04:45:35,580 --> 04:45:42,369

Thanks to the $1. Do you dream of twitch chat? I've had dreams of twitch chat before

1860
04:45:47,369 --> 04:45:55,930
I've actually think I've had a dream before where I was sleeping just in my bed and I was just seeing

1861
04:45:56,610 --> 04:46:00,849
Kind of the chat on the right side of in of just meet like, you know

1862
04:46:01,009 --> 04:46:06,569
I'm lying there with my eyes closed like it's all it's all black and I just see twitch chat on the right and it's just

1863
04:46:06,569 --> 04:46:11,169
Like he doesn't know he doesn't know what the fuck. Oh my god. What an idiot somebody text him

1864
04:46:11,169 --> 04:46:16,849
Anybody have it like it was that just spamming and there were like 30 or 40,000 concurrent people there and

1865
04:46:17,330 --> 04:46:21,250
I was like wait a minute hold on. I had like an internal panic. I'm like, wait, I'm sleeping. They're watching me sleep

1866
04:46:21,290 --> 04:46:29,659
How did I delete the stream on now? I'm sleeping and then I realized what was happening

1867
04:46:29,659 --> 04:46:36,779
But that's probably the only thing that's happened because then I'm thinking about like it

1868
04:46:36,819 --> 04:46:39,500
What do I have any clothes on like how many people are here what's going on?

1869
04:46:40,180 --> 04:46:45,639
Why is the stream on him? Why am I why am I asleep? What what's going on?

1870
04:46:46,240 --> 04:46:55,959
But yeah, Freudian weapon again. Thank you for the $1. Honestly, I would watch you play through anything RPGs, especially

1871
04:46:56,639 --> 04:47:00,560
Maybe persona 5 someday hashtag charity. I don't think so

1872
04:47:02,099 --> 04:47:06,619
I've never played a persona game before and I feel like starting at persona 5 is the equivalent of

1873
04:47:08,090 --> 04:47:09,290
watching

1874
04:47:09,290 --> 04:47:12,189
like

1875
04:47:12,189 --> 04:47:14,189
like watching Star Wars

1876
04:47:14,349 --> 04:47:20,209
That's like watching the new Star Wars movie before you even know what Star Wars. I guess I'll watch this

1877
04:47:20,729 --> 04:47:22,330
episode 7

1878
04:47:22,330 --> 04:47:39,509
You can't really do that. It doesn't matter. So they're not they're not connected at all. They're all self-contained except for the first two

1879
04:47:39,509 --> 04:47:55,389
Oh, oh, okay. Oh, there goes the one of the reasons then I actually saw on the ps4 store when I was browsing

1880
04:47:57,849 --> 04:48:02,680
There's a persona 5 dance game because that's what I thought it was at first

1881
04:48:02,720 --> 04:48:07,759
It was like persona 5 dance in the starlight or something and I'm like what the fuck why people like this game so much

1882
04:48:07,959 --> 04:48:10,439
It's like is there like a

1883
04:48:10,439 --> 04:48:15,080
This is a RPG, but just like a dancing simulator. I thought that's what persona 5 was

1884
04:48:15,639 --> 04:48:24,560
Because it's persona 5 like colon. Here's like a little tagline. I was like, okay, that's that's persona 5

1885
04:48:25,040 --> 04:48:36,720
So how so there's a there's also I saw persona 4 like dancing with the stars, right?

1886
04:48:37,159 --> 04:48:46,419
Cuz I got really confused and I watched the trailer

1887
04:48:47,639 --> 04:48:53,959
Everybody's like oh you gotta play persona 5. It's got such an engrossing story. It's like such an interesting game. It's so great

1888
04:48:53,959 --> 04:48:58,040
Oh Joker, and then I'm watching this trailer for the people. It's like a

1889
04:48:58,680 --> 04:49:01,319
It's like a DDR. I'm like, this is what okay

1890
04:49:01,880 --> 04:49:15,799
But I guess I mean I I've seen persona 3 be played and it was pretty interesting

1891
04:49:16,319 --> 04:49:24,270
I never played him myself though. Hey radio video. Thanks for the one dollar German

1894
04:49:39,599 --> 04:49:46,290
I probably would stream it. It's a great game

1895
04:49:46,810 --> 04:49:54,700

04:50:30,869 --> 04:50:36,400
Do you really honestly think that I would have a good funny idea for a joke?

1903
04:50:36,400 --> 04:50:38,400
I'm gonna spill the bucket over

1904
04:50:38,680 --> 04:50:45,040
Accidentally, I mean, okay sure, but if that happens like two or three hundred times

1905
04:50:45,799 --> 04:50:51,279
Does it do you think that at like not time number 300? I'm like, here we go. Here comes a funny thing

1906
04:50:51,279 --> 04:50:58,220
I'm gonna do yeah, this would be funny when I do this after like 200 times

1907
04:50:58,860 --> 04:51:07,049
No

1908
04:51:07,209 --> 04:51:12,340
There are certain things that I maybe I would

1909
04:51:13,340 --> 04:51:16,900
Potentially not tonight, but yeah sure like when I'm playing red dead

1910
04:51:16,900 --> 04:51:21,700
Oh, I'm gonna try to like time it so I can like run into the train like right and we all know that that's happening

1911
04:51:21,700 --> 04:51:23,919
And I tried a few times and I can't do it, right?

1912
04:51:24,459 --> 04:51:33,439
But I don't like plan whoops. I tripped. Oh, I gotta plan that one. You're unfunny like that

1913
04:51:34,000 --> 04:51:44,080
That's the same thing to fall off the horse thing. I do you think I'm making a joke after 75 times?

1914
04:51:52,240 --> 04:51:57,490
It's funny because I played Red Dead Redemption 2

1915
04:51:58,130 --> 04:52:04,389
Like two nights ago when I wasn't streaming I was just hanging out on the couch and I fell off more times

1916
04:52:04,709 --> 04:52:08,869
Than when I was streaming and I'm a little laughing to myself going like man

1917
04:52:08,869 --> 04:52:11,549
If only people were watching this they would be like, holy shit

1918
04:52:12,150 --> 04:52:19,590
without us

1919
04:52:19,590 --> 04:52:29,159
Yeah, I maybe I would stream Red Dead again, but I'm just I'm having fun. Just slowly going through on my own

1920
04:52:29,759 --> 04:52:37,439
You betrayed us

1921
04:52:37,439 --> 04:52:47,110
No, I streamed Red Dead like five times

1922
04:52:47,110 --> 04:52:57,599
I played about 30 or 40% of that entire game on stream that into the whole thing, but I mean, it's a long game

1923
04:52:58,080 --> 04:53:01,400
He thinks we aren't watching

1924
04:53:01,919 --> 04:53:08,869
Hey, man, boy. Thanks for the one dollar. Here you go. There's a link here. Okay here here you go

Never gonna say goodbye

1927
04:53:51,889 --> 04:53:53,889
Never gonna say goodbye

1928
04:53:53,970 --> 04:53:58,209
Never gonna say a lie or diss it. You've ruined my favorite song

1929
04:53:58,849 --> 04:54:08,689
Hey the spaz. Thank you for your huge amount of community subs and your five dollars here

04:54:33,290 --> 04:54:38,490
Demonic cucumber. Thanks for the one dollar. Can you tell me the name of a cooking device specifically used to mix eggs?

1934
04:54:41,299 --> 04:54:44,380
an egg beater

1935
04:54:55,409 --> 04:54:57,409

Thank you verse seem know for the one dollar hashtag charity, thank you Ike turtle thanks for the one dollar

Hey, just thought I'd donate to my favorite top 1,000 streamer

1938
04:55:16,220 --> 04:55:21,119
Nice to see you finally made it to the B tier and that's all I ever need to be

1939
04:55:23,180 --> 04:55:25,180
B is perfect where it is

1940
04:55:26,599 --> 04:55:29,680
I'm totally cool with a B grade

1941
04:55:30,240 --> 04:55:33,680
Anyway, I'm excited about the crypto safe stream. Also that makes eight now

1942
04:55:35,860 --> 04:55:54,209
It's how smug hashtag charity eight what? Thank you. Ike though. Appreciate was this this is what I just did

04:56:16,419 --> 04:56:31,779
No, it's flat. Never gonna say there it is replace it. Somebody mix that in and replace it, please

1945
04:56:32,220 --> 04:56:36,700
Hey Garfield the Monday killer. Thanks for the one dollar

1946
04:56:37,299 --> 04:56:46,180
Hey, Jerem ain't the Christmas season just garfy spider-man has quite the year hasn't a great PlayStation 4 game and awesome animated movie and

1947
04:56:46,340 --> 04:56:48,020
A big role in Infinity War

1948
04:56:48,020 --> 04:56:50,580
What a Garf tacky little year for Marvel as a whole

1949
04:56:50,779 --> 04:56:55,020
Once upon a Deadpool is given a dollar of every ticket sold to charity to stop in cancer

1950
04:56:55,099 --> 04:56:57,580
Plus there was a heartfelt apt credit scene

1951
04:56:58,340 --> 04:57:00,340
with Stan Lee

1952
04:57:00,540 --> 04:57:05,279
Brought a tear to my eye got to remember the importance of comics and the guys behind him German heart. Absolutely

1953
04:57:09,790 --> 04:57:22,819
Stan Lee created pretty much almost every single thing you think is cool. So

1954
04:57:26,419 --> 04:57:42,040
Rest in peace, but thank you Garfield. That was very nice

1955
04:57:42,540 --> 04:57:48,400
Very nice comment there. Hey pop. Follow me. Oh, thanks for the one dollar

1956
04:57:48,400 --> 04:57:52,880
You can guess how this game would be pretty fun with friends. It's really easy to walk over each other's buckets

1957
04:57:53,200 --> 04:57:57,919
Aside from that I've been playing ashen in my impressions as someone who has never played a souls game are very good

1958
04:57:58,240 --> 04:58:02,080
If you ever get a hold of it having a friend with you instead of an AI really makes the experience Mary

1959
04:58:02,680 --> 04:58:04,799
Kerma German heart Santa hat. Oh

1960
04:58:05,759 --> 04:58:08,119
Man, if you like ashen, oh boy

1961
04:58:08,639 --> 04:58:11,330
If you've never played a souls game before

1962
04:58:12,090 --> 04:58:16,180
You you got a lot to go through

1963
04:58:16,459 --> 04:58:24,000
But I think ashen would have to sit sort of on the back burner

1964
04:58:24,599 --> 04:58:28,360
Because that's a big commitment. Isn't it? It's a

1965
04:58:29,080 --> 04:58:32,000
It's not is it a long game. Is it was it like 30 hours or something like that?

1966
04:58:32,639 --> 04:58:43,220
20 30 40 hours was it short 20 hours

1967
04:58:43,700 --> 04:58:51,209
Yeah, but I've probably sit on the back burner. I don't have any plans for it not in the immediate future, but it is always there

1968
04:58:51,209 --> 04:58:53,209
That's the one thing about great thing about video games

1969
04:58:53,610 --> 04:58:56,060
They're always available

1970
04:58:56,060 --> 04:59:04,720
So if it's ever like what am I gonna play next week? Hmm. I don't know what I'm gonna do. Oh, okay

1971
04:59:05,080 --> 04:59:07,080

05:00:10,799 --> 05:00:14,580

You reax now you rearrange those last three words and you got now you're talking my language there. Fuck you table

1989
05:00:34,430 --> 05:00:44,479
Talked about that before the stream started. That's one of my favorite things. Thanks for the $5 face and cake

1990
05:00:44,479 --> 05:00:51,270
Thank you II dragon for the $5 hashtag charity. Thank you really appreciate it

1991
05:00:51,709 --> 05:00:58,599
Thank you bunny, but for the two dollars want to say thank you Jerma today was hard

1992
05:00:59,080 --> 05:01:06,159
Having a rough time with life, but it's always amazing to relax with one of your streams. You're amazingly uplifting. Hope to see you more

1993
05:01:07,000 --> 05:01:10,200
I'm really sorry to hear that you have in a rough time

1994
05:01:10,479 --> 05:01:18,270
glad you can relax and

1995
05:01:19,110 --> 05:01:24,159
Fuck around and chat crack a few jokes and hang up

1996
05:01:24,279 --> 05:01:33,979
That is what I care about number one, but thank you so much for the two dollars here. Hey the true

1997
05:01:34,619 --> 05:01:39,419
Michi, thanks for the one dollar. I bet you didn't forget that you said you will hit me up on discord eight months ago

1998
05:01:39,939 --> 05:01:45,439
well my brain I

1999
05:01:46,580 --> 05:01:47,819
kind of

2000
05:01:47,819 --> 05:01:55,939
Scatter it. He'll look into it. I've done that before

2001
05:01:56,740 --> 05:01:59,479
It's just I'm so bad

2002
05:01:59,880 --> 05:02:08,259
You know it took me it took me like there's like this guy in the stream and chat and he hangs out a lot

2003
05:02:08,740 --> 05:02:11,180
he was a college roommate of mine and

2004
05:02:12,959 --> 05:02:21,130
He's like he proved it. It was real and it took me like four to five straight months to remember. Oh, okay

2005
05:02:21,130 --> 05:02:29,310
And we taught we like actually talked so I am sorry. I'm very sorry

2006
05:02:29,310 --> 05:02:38,529
It's just my I scattered myself around and I lose track very very easily. It is not intentional

2007
05:02:40,110 --> 05:02:42,630
It's just sometimes like something else will come up over here. Something was come up over there

2008
05:02:42,630 --> 05:02:47,549
I have something else something will enter my brain and push out everything else and it's it's actually a really bad thing

2009
05:02:48,229 --> 05:02:54,119
But yes, I know

2010
05:02:55,439 --> 05:03:00,319
There are at least two I think there are at least one or two people that I do need to get in touch with so

2011
05:03:00,759 --> 05:03:07,880
I'm actually going to

2012
05:03:07,880 --> 05:03:18,229
Check exactly that when the stream ends. So it's okay. I'm just making it funny

2013
05:03:18,229 --> 05:03:23,459
I will be there in July 2019 to say the exact same thing

2014
05:03:23,860 --> 05:03:28,419
No, no, that's not gonna have it. I once I like remember and get on it. Usually I get on it

2015
05:03:28,779 --> 05:03:32,080
But it is one of my flaws

2016
05:03:32,599 --> 05:03:40,119
And I do apologize for it, but thank you for the one dollar. Thank you for reminding me

2017
05:03:41,610 --> 05:03:43,290
Thank you

2018
05:03:43,290 --> 05:03:46,810

2019
05:03:47,290 --> 05:03:48,490
kitty

2020
05:03:48,490 --> 05:03:57,459
For the five dollars. Thanks so much for the stream today. Haven't laughed that hard in a while. I appreciate it

2021
05:03:57,459 --> 05:04:00,520
Thanks for hanging out. I had a lot of fun. It was blessed

2022
05:04:01,240 --> 05:04:07,450
Hey buster boy, thank you for the one dollar German. Just don't play mother three. It's such a boring game

2023
05:04:07,450 --> 05:04:14,119
You wouldn't enjoy it. Do we have a one guy versus one guy scenario here?

2024
05:04:14,119 --> 05:04:28,729
I think so because I think what did this is tough. This is 1v1 one guy

2025
05:04:29,270 --> 05:04:39,360
Hmm play mother three. There you go. I'm the second guy. I

2026
05:04:42,450 --> 05:04:47,220
Don't know if I would do enough three RPGs, I just I I don't know if I would do them on stream

2027
05:04:47,220 --> 05:04:56,049
I can't commit to that and be say yes y'all do mother one two. I'm gonna play earthbound and then mother three

2028
05:04:56,689 --> 05:05:15,270
What's the famous quote that I'm about to say right now? I'll look into it. I'm gonna look into that

2029
05:05:15,970 --> 05:05:21,669
PK fire PK thunder PK star storm

2030
05:05:22,189 --> 05:05:24,549
PK freeze PK freeze

2031
05:05:25,310 --> 05:05:27,310
PK freeze

2032
05:05:28,430 --> 05:05:30,430
PK freeze I

2033
05:05:31,509 --> 05:05:33,509
Still fucking got it

2034
05:05:33,509 --> 05:05:48,000
Peter Peter please

2035
05:05:48,759 --> 05:05:50,759
Peter Peter freeze

2036
05:05:50,799 --> 05:06:02,759
Hey attack of the Hank. Thanks for the two dollars

2037
05:06:03,159 --> 05:06:10,220
It's the zombie apocalypse. You can bring one character that has been in any of the German rumbles to join your zombie survival squad

2038
05:06:10,220 --> 05:06:11,419
Who do you choose?

2039
05:06:11,419 --> 05:06:20,430
Dr. Ocher is that a heart? That's a not a hard question

2040
05:06:20,950 --> 05:06:26,310
Timmy Tim tan thanks for the one dollar my sleep schedule so messed up at the moment that I missed the entire stream and

2041
05:06:26,310 --> 05:06:31,029
Only came in at the end at 4 a.m. Your streams are very good. You're the best streamer on twitch

2042
05:06:31,669 --> 05:06:38,180
hashtag charity

2043
05:06:39,240 --> 05:06:43,650
Having a messed-up sleep schedule always sucks. You just feel all messed up

2044
05:06:45,189 --> 05:06:49,549
Disconnected and everything and I'm sorry that your sleep schedule is a little screwy

2045
05:06:51,069 --> 05:06:53,069
but thank you for

2046
05:06:53,709 --> 05:07:05,729
Calling me the best streamer on twitch. That's I thank you. I don't really want to

2047
05:07:06,930 --> 05:07:10,619
I don't know if I want to agree with that because I

2048
05:07:13,459 --> 05:07:19,330
Anytime that I start to think that I'm the best. I'm the best on twitch

2049
05:07:19,889 --> 05:07:23,000
Then I feel like I would start to degrade in quality

2050
05:07:23,000 --> 05:07:28,979
I feel like I would be like that's it. I did it. I'm the best and I don't want to do that

2051
05:07:28,979 --> 05:07:46,040
I really really appreciate the fact that you think that but I

2052
05:07:47,279 --> 05:07:53,659
I'm floored that people think that there's so many people that stream here. There are thought they were like

You seem so satisfied with what you are accomplishing and that rubs off onto your audience. Keep doing what you love

Doesn't matter what it is and I'm not even talking about just entertainment shit

2101
05:13:23,919 --> 05:13:27,720

2112
05:14:31,490 --> 05:14:40,119
Because you see a button and you have to press it you hear a phone ringing and it could be anyone

2113
05:14:40,560 --> 05:14:45,599
But a ringing phone has to be answered. Doesn't it? I don't remember that movie

2114
05:14:46,200 --> 05:14:50,040
Now you stay right there and don't get out of that phone booth. Don't you move from that phone booth?
