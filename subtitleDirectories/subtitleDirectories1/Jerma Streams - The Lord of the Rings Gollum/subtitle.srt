1
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:34,570
Hey, what's up? It's been 90 seconds. It's only been 90 seconds.

2
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:54,439
Confirm what kind of bug you'd be. Um, I don't know. What bug would I be? I would probably be a...

3
00:00:57,609 --> 00:01:15,030
Yeah, I don't think it'd be a beetle. No, no, no, no. I would be a big ant.

4
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:20,500
Yeah, one of the big ones too.

5
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:29,109
No, dude, you'd be lice.

6
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:37,079
I don't think I'd be lice. I think you know I'd give me... Hi, hello. How are you doing? It's been a while.

7
00:01:38,569 --> 00:01:40,569
I've been a very busy boy.

8
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:51,859
But it's good to see you again. You'd be a grasshopper?

9
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:06,569
Hmm. I don't think I can move that quickly. No, I think big ant is a good one. You'd be a cockroach. No.

10
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:13,909
No, I don't know. Maybe like one of the... I don't know. Maybe a beetle. All right, who gives a shit? Hi, welcome.

11
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:15,990
We're gonna be playing Gollum today.

12
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:18,150
I'm gonna be playing Gollum with a twist.

13
00:02:18,629 --> 00:02:20,759
Okay?

14
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:22,759
I've heard this game is pretty...

15
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:24,860
bad.

16
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:27,419
But I did say that I wanted to play it.

17
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:30,060
I made a very, very important point

18
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:36,219
a week or two ago when I knew this was coming out. It's like I have to play this. I... How could I not play this game?

19
00:02:37,939 --> 00:02:39,460
Uh, so...

20
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:42,659
I'm going to give myself a one hour and 55 minute timer

21
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:46,819
to get as far as I can in the game as fast as I can.

22
00:02:52,539 --> 00:02:54,539
I'm going for a speed run.

23
00:02:54,699 --> 00:02:56,699
I'm gonna see if I can speed run

24
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:04,120
the Lord of the Rings Gollum. Do you think I can do it in two hours?

25
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:11,110
What do you think?

26
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:15,830
No, no, not even close. No, that's fucked up. You don't think I could do it in three hours? What about three hours?

27
00:03:16,469 --> 00:03:18,469
He wants to refund it.

28
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:25,770
I just... I'm just saying, uh, how far can I get it in two hours?

29
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:31,909
I just was... I was curious how far I could get in exactly one hour and 55 minutes.

30
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:36,759
The game is like 10 hours long?

31
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,939
What?

32
00:03:40,939 --> 00:03:42,939
Is it actually? Oh shit. Well,

33
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:48,169
let's see how we get in a couple hours. We'll see. I have to play it.

34
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:50,569
I... Look, even if we're gonna play it for like an hour, I don't even care.

35
00:03:52,949 --> 00:03:54,949
We're also gonna play Street Fighter 6

36
00:03:56,090 --> 00:04:01,590
at some point in the next hour or two. I want to play that single player mode.

37
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:06,009
I'm going... I'm doing the single player Andy on Street Fighter 6

38
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:12,889
because that open world seems really really fun to me.

39
00:04:14,009 --> 00:04:21,860
So we're gonna play that.

40
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:23,860
You're way too old for this game.

41
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:28,519
Wait, you're saying I'm too old for Street Fighter 6?

42
00:04:29,779 --> 00:04:30,819
Why?

43
00:04:30,819 --> 00:04:34,600
I don't think I'm too old for that game.

44
00:04:35,529 --> 00:04:38,490
All right. Well, anyways, uh, I do have a...

45
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:42,970
I... You might hear a fan in the background. It's really hot.

46
00:04:43,529 --> 00:04:48,139
It's like a million degrees right now. So you probably hear a fan in the background. That's the way it is.

47
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:52,459
If it gets too distracting, I'll turn it up even higher to get rid of a bunch of you.

48
00:04:53,500 --> 00:05:01,990
Okay. Million. We can't hear the fan. Oh, nice. That means my...

49
00:05:04,649 --> 00:05:08,730
All right. Well, are you ready? And look, I know people want a face cam, but I'm sorry.

50
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:13,589
Sorry, you're not gonna get it immediately. I don't know. Maybe you will later. I don't know.

51
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:16,230
We're just gonna play Lord of the Rings Golem.

52
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:23,160
All right, I am opening it, which means I have to start the timer. I have a 1 hour and 55 minute timer here.

53
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:27,290
I just want to see how far I can get.

54
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:29,850
We don't even have to follow it. I just want to know how far.

55
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:35,620
Okay, you ready?

56
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:36,740
It's opening.

57
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:39,300
Okay.

58
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:42,810
Almost there.

59
00:05:42,889 --> 00:05:45,720
Okay.

60
00:05:45,720 --> 00:06:03,560
Okay. Can you see it? Why can I not hear anything? Okay.

61
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:17,579
Why is the game quiet? You're gonna waste time sitting around idle? I don't think so.

62
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:23,110
Now I can hear it. There it is.

63
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:28,279
I can't waste any time. I actually have to start right now. I have to start right now.

64
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:34,899
I don't know. Whatever's happening, I gotta go right now. I'm gonna speed run this game. Clock is ticking. Let's go.

65
00:06:42,259 --> 00:06:44,899
All right, let's turn the timer off for now. Well, not off, but get out of the way.

66
00:06:51,579 --> 00:06:52,699
Skip?

67
00:06:52,699 --> 00:06:54,699
No, I want to see what happens.

68
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:04,870
I have to see what happens.

69
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:16,730
You're wasting time. Am I?

70
00:07:17,449 --> 00:07:21,610
But it wasn't roses, my precious. Not roses.

71
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:24,410
Time lost. Time lost.

72
00:07:26,009 --> 00:07:28,500
But what if I don't know where to go?

73
00:07:33,829 --> 00:07:38,310
I am wasting precious minutes, you're right. Okay. No, we're good. We're good. It's gonna be a bad split. No, we're fine.

74
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:57,899
Do you get a sword in this game? Do you get to actually use a two-handed sword as golem and just like start slashing people?

75
00:08:01,339 --> 00:08:07,480
Let's see how he responds to some light.

76
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:22,759
The darkness grows beyond our borders. My people are growing anxious. We cannot let this evil linger among us.

77
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:28,069
We believe that he went to Mordor.

78
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,509
That's what I feared.

79
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,700
Where does this take place in the timeline?

80
00:08:35,179 --> 00:08:43,740
I wonder he has to say. That's too bright.

81
00:08:51,340 --> 00:09:03,159
All right, there we go. We got plenty of time. Why don't we start with your name?

82
00:09:05,929 --> 00:09:11,289
Your real name, not the one others have given you. I don't have to actually put a name in, do I?

83
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:15,370
It's not a what is your name RPG segment right now, is there?

84
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:23,080
I kind of hope there is. Very well. Let us try someone else's name. Oh, it really is.

85
00:09:24,759 --> 00:09:26,440
Yes.

86
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:35,299
Yes, you remember him. He found you more than 60 years ago.

87
00:09:35,539 --> 00:09:45,220
Oh, that's when it takes place. Deep underneath the roots of the Misty Mountains. He took something from you.

88
00:09:48,679 --> 00:09:52,179
A ring.

89
00:09:52,179 --> 00:10:04,409
Following the books of J.R.R. Tolkien. You were looking for it, weren't you?

90
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:10,889
Following the books. You left your home in the mountains.

91
00:10:11,769 --> 00:10:15,769
Worming your way down the hills, always hiding from the moon.

92
00:10:16,919 --> 00:10:18,919
Tolkien shits his pants if he saw it.

93
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:24,179
All the way east to the Lonely Mountain.

94
00:10:25,059 --> 00:10:27,620
But then you stop, turn south.

95
00:10:33,429 --> 00:10:41,049
Something must have drawn you away. A voice calling you to the land of shadow.

96
00:10:43,049 --> 00:10:46,120
Whispering your name in your dream.

97
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:55,799
The Lord of the Rings. Gollum. The Adventure.

98
00:10:56,679 --> 00:11:02,600
That absolutely no one asked for. No one wanted. But here it is.

99
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:09,259
Very well, Smeagol.

100
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:15,639
Now, let us start at the beginning. What amounts to a small stealth section.

101
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:21,299
Hated in every video game we turned into an entire 12-hour experience.

102
00:11:30,009 --> 00:11:32,009
Gandalf, the all-going.

103
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:36,789
Uh, let's see. Ah, plenty of time. We're good.

104
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:54,549
All right, let let's be fair. Can I be fair?

105
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:58,940
Is this game that bad?

106
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:02,139
I have no I've been so completely disconnected from the universe

107
00:12:03,779 --> 00:12:05,779
For the last couple of weeks. Is it bad?

108
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:09,700
Let's go in with an open mind. Okay, we're gonna go in with an open mind.

109
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:13,740
I'm telling you the second that I hear

110
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:20,200
Oh, the misty mountains. Oh, I'm gonna give it a full letter grade

111
00:12:23,059 --> 00:12:33,509
Okay

112
00:12:33,509 --> 00:12:36,389
All right, go go. I gotta I have to hurry. I gotta go now

113
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:53,929
I said see we just did a little bit of research. Remember you suck already

114
00:12:56,169 --> 00:12:57,769
I didn't do anything

115
00:12:57,769 --> 00:13:04,230
Is there a punch button?

116
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:06,230
There has to be a punch button, right?

117
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:17,240
I he kind of has like the face of like a coca melon kid

118
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:23,059
You know what i'm saying? Like, I don't know. There's something weird about the eyes. I don't know what it is

119
00:13:27,419 --> 00:13:30,870
bar jump

120
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:36,470
Oh nice, it's pretty fluid

121
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:49,080
What can hurt why did he do that? I don't know I'm fucking having fun

122
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:59,299
Dude, he bounced mountains of shadow. That is where you are hiding

123
00:14:03,779 --> 00:14:06,740
Why does it sound like somebody's hand is like wringing his throat

124
00:14:08,779 --> 00:14:12,059
It sounds like somebody's got a nice throat holding his throat

125
00:14:21,539 --> 00:14:24,100
All right. What's wrong with this? What what's wrong with this?

126
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I don't see a problem with this game so far

127
00:14:28,139 --> 00:14:37,639
What's wrong with this?

128
00:14:37,639 --> 00:14:39,259
Seems kind of fun

129
00:14:39,259 --> 00:14:41,539
What's the problem?

130
00:14:41,539 --> 00:14:55,220
Why does everybody have such a problem with this? How do I get up there?

131
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:03,740
Golem can really move

132
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:21,240
Gandalf is fucking strangling him. Oh, sir. You talk to the orcs, huh?

133
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:29,779
I don't know about you little that's what it sounds like. It's only we're hearing this

134
00:15:39,299 --> 00:15:46,059
No, get up here grab ledge below, okay

135
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:56,200
I just hit my chin

136
00:15:56,200 --> 00:16:07,899
Hot cut scene

137
00:16:08,139 --> 00:16:15,399
Oh

138
00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:21,799
Is that a refund timer?

139
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,500
No

140
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,620
It's a

141
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:26,620
Test it out check it out timer

142
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:32,379
That's what it is

143
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:48,179
I just keep seeing Gandalf leaning down with both hands around his neck

144
00:16:49,139 --> 00:16:51,139
Leaning in and what next tell me

145
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:55,210
It's just both both hands are around not just one

146
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:04,970
Look at drawing. Did I do this? I must have had friends one of family

147
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:24,410
Is that my health on the lower left, okay, so I have a health bar

148
00:17:25,049 --> 00:17:31,680
It was ours

149
00:17:40,619 --> 00:17:42,619
Yes

150
00:17:43,099 --> 00:17:45,099
By the way

151
00:17:45,099 --> 00:17:47,099
Hold on

152
00:17:50,779 --> 00:17:52,920
He cannot sleep now

153
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:55,960
But I shelled him the light or you up and get the sword and the armor

154
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:04,380
Okay, can I do it?

155
00:18:10,779 --> 00:18:13,529
What is it? What was that?

156
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,680
I paid four dollars for that

157
00:18:25,549 --> 00:18:26,750
Does he dance

158
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:36,170
I have I bought these

159
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:41,799
How many are there?

160
00:18:41,799 --> 00:18:46,920
Hold on. I paid three. What was the three or four dollars to have him get scared by bugs sometimes

161
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:58,109
Why did you do that? I don't know. I was just what this is a testing period

162
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:07,180
And for only $3.99 you can get the golem and the bug comedy pack

163
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:11,799
Belly laugh out loud while golem gets scared of the beetle

164
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:18,539

I mean, honestly if you slicked back

255
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:17,440
If you slicked it back, it would look fine

256
00:35:17,519 --> 00:35:22,159
Just put it run put your head in the water slick it back. It would look he would look great. He'd look fine

00:36:04,679 --> 00:36:08,780
We have to make a decision

262
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:12,829
I'm not gonna kill the beetle because I like the beetle

263
00:36:15,070 --> 00:36:15,949

Pollen yes, it hasn't been following us has it this is so weird

269
00:36:54,719 --> 00:36:56,719

00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:37,159
I can't believe there are 21 000 people here watching this

276
00:37:38,559 --> 00:37:39,599

277
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:41,599
Yeah, i've been trying to figure that out for the last like

278
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:45,880
Five to ten years

279
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:46,920

282
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,630
Death eater

283
00:37:53,630 --> 00:38:00,880
Is that correct?

284
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:06,639
What are they called? I don't know

285
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:11,230
Wrong universe

286
00:38:16,590 --> 00:38:20,559
You're a fake fan

287
00:38:20,559 --> 00:38:24,159
I mean, I I like lord of the rings. I think it's cool. I think it's a really cool franchise

288
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:31,769
You haven't even seen the movies. Yeah, I have but it's been

289
00:38:32,329 --> 00:38:34,329
It's been like 15 years

290
00:38:35,449 --> 00:38:37,929
Jesus thank god. I put a limiter on

291
00:38:38,489 --> 00:38:49,980
Find something to eat

292
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:54,250
Mushrooms do we have to cook food if we do it's a four letter grade higher

293
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:06,320
Why did he just do he just ate that like a weird bird he's why did he do that?

294
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:09,119
He puts his head up. It was like a fucking gopher

295
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:24,250
What was that?

296
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:47,119
Use golem's intuition what oh I okay, of course, there's a

297
00:39:47,679 --> 00:40:02,909
Of course, there's a detective mode there has to be use golem vision to see

298
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:13,469
With our new golem vision technology. You'll be able you'll be able to perceive the world like golem does

299
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:55,659
Where do I go?

300
00:40:55,659 --> 00:41:10,320
I don't know

301
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,960

No

306
00:42:10,250 --> 00:42:19,400
Look at me. The only thing that was missing was the last three piano keys being pressed every 15 seconds during the

307
00:42:23,039 --> 00:42:31,559
Look at me they brought you to him didn't they the dark lord?

308
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:34,989
What did you tell him?

309
00:42:34,989 --> 00:42:36,989
What did you tell sauron?

310
00:42:39,610 --> 00:42:41,610

311
00:42:42,570 --> 00:42:44,940
I told him everything

312
00:42:46,059 --> 00:42:51,659
I told him about how to crush mushrooms and eat them and it'll eat dirt off the ground. I'm sorry. Can't help

313
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:54,860
I told him everything I know

314
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:14,090
Oh, what the fuck

315
00:43:14,250 --> 00:43:22,889
Really?

316
00:43:22,889 --> 00:43:36,340
What the fuck? Oh, I also bought the

317
00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:43,690
You can have it be the different language. I don't know. Does does golem speak that language? What is it called?

318
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:49,909
I bought that too. It's the elvish language. Yeah

319
00:43:52,170 --> 00:43:54,170
No, not the japanese language

320
00:43:57,210 --> 00:43:59,210
It's like uh

321
00:44:02,730 --> 00:44:31,099

335
00:46:42,619 --> 00:46:44,539
Stop complimenting

336
00:46:44,539 --> 00:46:47,019
No, i'm not. I mean this game is not good at all

337
00:46:49,130 --> 00:46:53,130
The graphics are fine. What's wrong? I mean, what are the graphics?

338
00:46:58,889 --> 00:47:00,889
Graphics are fine

339
00:47:10,219 --> 00:47:12,219
I

340
00:47:49,190 --> 00:48:07,159
Need to turn on the other language thing report to the beast master

341
00:48:08,599 --> 00:48:13,929
Just keep your head down do the masters tell you hold on a second. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait

342
00:48:17,619 --> 00:48:21,530
Where is it? How do I turn it on?

343
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:44,230
Okay, elves speak. Wait elves speak elvish. It's not everybody. It's only the elves speak elvish

344
00:48:44,550 --> 00:48:55,960
It's not everybody. Oh, that's kind of disappointing. I thought it was gonna be everybody would speak elvish

345
00:48:56,280 --> 00:49:05,369
I guess why would that happen? All right, let's go

346
00:49:07,769 --> 00:49:10,949
Just keep your head down do the masters tell you

347
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:20,119
What is that thing not a dwarf not a goblin for either of them

348
00:49:21,820 --> 00:49:23,820
Yes, my king. They're talking about me

349
00:49:24,699 --> 00:49:36,480
Wait, we have to like escape a beast or something

350
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,559
Oh, i'm gonna imagine we're all not gonna make it

351
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:03,099
Okay

352
00:50:23,579 --> 00:50:25,579
I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready

353
00:50:26,780 --> 00:50:28,780
Whatever we want to do

354
00:50:32,059 --> 00:50:36,460
What to fight this way fight the beast

355
00:50:48,199 --> 00:50:52,469
Golem you're going to die down here golem my advice

356
00:50:53,510 --> 00:50:58,389
Make your death count. You have to get the boroks back into the pens as fast as okay

357
00:50:59,110 --> 00:51:01,110
They let you starve if you're slow

358
00:51:01,670 --> 00:51:03,030
the beasts

359
00:51:03,030 --> 00:51:08,070
If they run at you find cover get to high ground if you can they don't have the best eye

360
00:51:08,230 --> 00:51:10,230
He is walking really fast

361
00:51:11,340 --> 00:51:13,340
Then quickly like really fast

362
00:51:18,570 --> 00:51:20,570
We're moving way too quickly

363
00:51:27,449 --> 00:51:30,250
Cool

364
00:51:30,250 --> 00:51:32,619
The gate is not for us

365
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:46,019
Okay, first things first slaves chase the cattle chase the cattle

366
00:51:47,059 --> 00:51:49,059
What you are the bait?

367
00:51:51,460 --> 00:51:52,820
Okay

368
00:51:52,820 --> 00:51:55,619
Lure the animal into the pen and then quickly shut the gate

369
00:51:57,900 --> 00:52:00,139
Those beasts love to break the levers

370
00:52:01,210 --> 00:52:03,210
That's why there is another one on top

371
00:52:05,369 --> 00:52:08,889
Uh-huh now down on the other side carefully

372
00:52:09,530 --> 00:52:41,590
That's it get his attention and run golem loves beetles precious beetle

373
00:52:55,110 --> 00:53:22,170
Get up there. Oh shit wrong button go up. That's it. Did I do it? Hold on. No, it's not

374
00:53:29,849 --> 00:53:33,929
Very well. There is another pen back there. All right. Do I have to get both of them in here?

375
00:53:33,929 --> 00:53:36,489
The way is long and the boroks are fast

376
00:53:37,820 --> 00:53:41,739
These ones are bulls so I wouldn't trust defenses to stop them

377
00:53:43,340 --> 00:53:47,260
If they get too close try getting to higher ground, okay

378
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:56,900
Let's go. They're not even that fast

379
00:53:57,619 --> 00:54:08,230
They can't even get up here. Can they can you guys get over here?

380
00:54:12,019 --> 00:54:14,739
Oh

381
00:54:14,739 --> 00:54:27,670

387
00:55:07,539 --> 00:55:10,980
What the fuck is all this shit, I don't what

388
00:55:20,820 --> 00:55:23,539
Don't they run away?

389
00:55:23,539 --> 00:55:26,340
All right. Whoa, I thought they were already I thought they weren't in here yet

390
00:55:28,699 --> 00:55:37,699
Whoa, i'm gonna make sure I get that tuber gameplay are you wearing headphones? Yes, I actually am

391
00:55:38,420 --> 00:55:46,550
Smeagol has promised he'll find the precious for him

392
00:55:47,190 --> 00:55:50,469
He swears. All right, so I gotta go over here

393
00:55:59,159 --> 00:56:01,159
God damn it. I fell off

394
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:15,900
I'm doing all right

395
00:56:16,300 --> 00:56:20,539
Not too good either no more work down below though

396
00:56:21,269 --> 00:56:27,429
They want me to keep an eye on you their new scheme to humiliate me, I suppose

397
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:30,920
next the mines

398
00:56:35,239 --> 00:56:38,949
Okay

399
00:56:38,949 --> 00:56:44,869
Jeremy you look you seem like you like powdered milk

400
00:56:46,380 --> 00:56:47,820
I don't

401
00:56:47,820 --> 00:56:50,780
And plus powdered milk is actually part of recipes and shit. So

402
00:56:51,579 --> 00:56:54,860
I mean, it's not like I like powdered milk, but it might be in something I like

403
00:56:55,579 --> 00:56:58,840
I don't have to enjoy I don't enjoy powdered milk

404
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:04,730
I had to be an ingredient in something

405
00:57:04,889 --> 00:57:15,099
All right, so we're gonna talk to we're gonna talk to these people. Is it asking riddles? Don't listen to her

406
00:57:15,420 --> 00:57:17,420
There's a reason she's in a cage

407
00:57:23,719 --> 00:57:31,159
Is it a witch precious does it know curses he's definitely perhaps coats himself in powdered milk

408
00:57:32,579 --> 00:57:34,820
No water no no nice water

409
00:57:38,260 --> 00:57:49,829
Disgusting

410
00:57:49,829 --> 00:57:54,550
Honestly, they should have gone completely full just wacko mode with this

411
00:57:55,429 --> 00:57:58,789
They should yeah, I should have a two-handed mace in my hands

412
00:57:59,510 --> 00:58:04,469
And a suit of armor and stuff just go full comedy take it out of cannon. Who cares? It would have been so much more fun

413
00:58:04,469 --> 00:58:06,469
No

414
00:58:16,389 --> 00:58:17,590
Please

415
00:58:17,590 --> 00:58:21,190
Sneaker doesn't know doesn't know the words does he

416
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:29,400
No, and what does a good slave do ranger a good slave that doesn't know the words

417
00:58:30,710 --> 00:58:32,550
He learns

418
00:58:32,550 --> 00:58:35,030
Maybe you should run little slave

419
00:58:35,670 --> 00:58:38,789
We want to be done before the third horn

420
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:40,949
Don't worry

421
00:58:40,949 --> 00:58:45,579
Okay

422
00:58:45,579 --> 00:58:47,940
This is yawned

423
00:58:47,940 --> 00:58:54,090
Oh, oh games didn't no game didn't crash. We still we got an hour. I don't want to hear any complaints

424
00:58:59,909 --> 00:59:03,369
This is the whole game

425
00:59:04,809 --> 00:59:06,809
Now there's more to this

426
00:59:11,289 --> 00:59:15,289
No, there's more to the tags like the one they gave you eight

427
00:59:17,900 --> 00:59:19,900
Find eight tags

428
00:59:22,460 --> 00:59:24,460
These are the mild parts

429
00:59:25,190 --> 00:59:27,190
And when you pick up a tag

430
00:59:27,429 --> 00:59:29,429
Be careful because after two

431
00:59:30,210 --> 00:59:33,989
Slender man will start to follow you after three he speeds up

432
00:59:35,030 --> 00:59:37,750
After four he can teleport so be careful

433
00:59:42,340 --> 00:59:45,670
What am I what am I doing

434
00:59:46,230 --> 00:59:48,630
God I can't play this. There's too much

435
00:59:53,460 --> 00:59:56,659
I need to get eight notes. Can I make this jump if I try?

436
00:59:57,619 --> 00:59:59,989
I can do it

437
01:00:03,239 --> 01:00:05,380
I just see that

438
01:00:05,380 --> 01:00:07,380
You're the guy lying down over there

439
01:00:18,059 --> 01:00:21,260
All right. I just gotta get down there to pick up one of the notes

440
01:00:21,980 --> 01:00:29,530
Watch out for the bubble

441
01:00:29,929 --> 01:00:40,429
Okay, just be careful. Oh shit. No, we're good. He's incredible and now he's coming here. It gives me shivers

442
01:00:43,989 --> 01:00:45,989
Okay one out of eight

443
01:00:57,909 --> 01:01:04,199
Okay, I gotta get seven of these why does it hurt every time

444
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:19,400
I want rocks

445
01:01:25,590 --> 01:01:27,510
Jump in the lava

446
01:01:27,510 --> 01:01:29,510
I don't want to start this over again

447
01:01:29,510 --> 01:01:31,110
How much time do I have left?

448
01:01:31,110 --> 01:01:33,670
Oh, that's not I don't know if there's enough time to go in the lava

449
01:01:35,619 --> 01:01:44,019
Why don't I get back up? It'll be really funny

450
01:01:44,739 --> 01:01:54,150
I don't know if it'll be really funny. I think it would just be moderately

451
01:01:54,869 --> 01:01:56,869
chuckle inducing

452
01:01:56,869 --> 01:02:02,070
I don't think it'd be funny

453
01:02:02,070 --> 01:02:05,210
Three a three

454
01:02:05,210 --> 01:02:10,840
This is not bad timing

455
01:02:10,840 --> 01:02:13,019
You already missed one

456
01:02:13,019 --> 01:02:23,130
What I can't get up there?

457
01:02:25,670 --> 01:02:47,960
I missed one. How do I get the hell out of here? How do I get the hell out of here?

458
01:02:52,860 --> 01:02:54,860
I'm not actually soft-locked here. Am I?

459
01:02:55,260 --> 01:02:57,260
No, I think okay. There we go

460
01:03:05,260 --> 01:03:08,900
What's that? What is that for? Oh, wait

461
01:03:12,949 --> 01:03:14,949
He's I'm not gonna fall in the lava

462
01:03:15,510 --> 01:03:22,949
I and it was it was perfect setup for me to do that. But

463
01:03:23,590 --> 01:03:25,590
Well, it was just really funny

464
01:03:25,670 --> 01:03:29,349
It was wicked funny

465
01:03:29,349 --> 01:03:31,670
But that's what you have to do is to get it, right?

466
01:03:33,269 --> 01:03:34,869
Okay, so

467
01:03:34,869 --> 01:03:37,800
What happened there?

468
01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:39,800
Okay, I can't grab I cannot grab that

469
01:03:40,280 --> 01:03:48,219
Whatever. Let's go. Oh right over there. Okay, all right

508
01:07:04,090 --> 01:07:15,820
Is the one here water take tag or leave?

509
01:07:16,300 --> 01:07:18,300
Um, aren't I supposed to be taking tags?

510
01:07:21,719 --> 01:07:24,860
Sleep now much work for one day

511
01:07:27,369 --> 01:07:29,369
That's number six

512
01:07:29,929 --> 01:07:31,929
Two more over that way

513
01:07:41,219 --> 01:07:43,940
We only need two more tags

514
01:08:18,010 --> 01:08:19,369
I just have so

515
01:08:19,369 --> 01:08:23,050
I was done like an hour ago, but not really. I just need to give it a chance

516
01:08:26,979 --> 01:08:29,539
I was just so done an hour ago

517
01:08:30,659 --> 01:08:34,659
But what if it's fun? What if it gets better? It could be fun later on

518
01:08:36,810 --> 01:08:38,810
Uninstall refund

519
01:08:39,289 --> 01:08:40,489
No

520
01:08:40,489 --> 01:08:43,130
Don't refund

521
01:08:43,130 --> 01:08:45,130
It could get much better

522
01:08:45,720 --> 01:08:48,359
Precious is our home. What is that?

523
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:50,520
Looks like a frog

524
01:08:50,520 --> 01:08:52,119
Don't listen my love

525
01:08:52,119 --> 01:08:53,560
Can I push you off?

526
01:08:53,560 --> 01:09:01,560
All right. How do where is this other one down here?

527
01:09:07,460 --> 01:09:16,220
What the hell?

528
01:09:16,220 --> 01:09:20,579
This where is it?

529
01:09:20,579 --> 01:09:22,579
He's gonna quit not yet

530
01:09:23,300 --> 01:09:25,270
Not yet

531
01:09:25,270 --> 01:09:30,199
Sorry, not yet. Um, i'm gonna die if I hit that

532
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:38,380
I don't know what the hell i'm going

533
01:09:38,380 --> 01:09:41,579
I have no idea

534
01:09:41,899 --> 01:09:43,020
Okay

535
01:09:43,020 --> 01:09:43,899
so

536
01:09:43,979 --> 01:09:45,659
Around here

537
01:09:45,659 --> 01:09:51,859
Why does it keeps changing on me?

538
01:09:53,340 --> 01:10:03,579
Wait, hold on. All right, only one more

539
01:10:10,039 --> 01:10:19,619
Last one

540
01:10:21,210 --> 01:10:23,369
There people thought I was gonna leave before doing this

541
01:10:26,710 --> 01:10:29,210
Everyone thought I was gonna quit before that

542
01:10:32,460 --> 01:10:37,319
You were wrong, i'm sorry

543
01:10:37,319 --> 01:10:39,319
This is the entire game by the way

544
01:10:40,899 --> 01:10:42,819
But you don't know that

545
01:10:42,819 --> 01:10:44,819
You haven't played it

546
01:10:46,060 --> 01:10:51,210
You watched the review video they gave this a two out of ten you didn't see the rest of this

547
01:10:51,770 --> 01:10:55,819
Yeah, I know we we I I you saw the review video

548
01:10:57,659 --> 01:10:59,659
This game got a three. All right. I I know

549
01:11:03,930 --> 01:11:05,930
They're sending the week up to the tower

550
01:11:17,460 --> 01:11:19,460
40 more tags

551
01:11:32,300 --> 01:11:34,300
You sound like you're what

552
01:11:34,779 --> 01:11:42,100
It's my turn

553
01:11:42,340 --> 01:11:45,220
Hold on. I have to I have to put my hands together and say precious

554
01:11:46,500 --> 01:11:48,739
My precious

555
01:11:49,220 --> 01:11:54,149
Don't go precious

556
01:12:05,130 --> 01:12:08,949
What are you gonna do if I

557
01:12:08,949 --> 01:12:12,340
You gotta do something about these bugs

558
01:12:12,420 --> 01:12:14,420
What are you gonna do? You're gonna you're gonna hit me with that if I don't go

559
01:12:14,979 --> 01:12:20,140
What are you gonna do? You're gonna you're gonna you're gonna hit me if I don't go

560
01:12:20,779 --> 01:12:34,539
So wait, is this golem telling this story to gandalf?

561
01:12:36,069 --> 01:12:39,020
This is a long story

562
01:12:39,340 --> 01:12:41,260
Skip to the part where you

563
01:12:41,260 --> 01:12:44,460
Met up with Frodo that time. I don't care about anything else in the middle

564
01:12:45,189 --> 01:12:49,350
Only relevant information golem. I I don't really care about anything else you're saying

565
01:12:52,949 --> 01:12:56,390
And then we picked up seven tags master

566
01:13:12,890 --> 01:13:19,960
What

567
01:13:19,960 --> 01:13:26,100
Uh-oh turn to your cell and end the day

568
01:13:27,689 --> 01:13:29,210
End the day

569
01:13:29,210 --> 01:13:47,659
How do I get out of here? Wait, it's probably a secret in here

570
01:13:48,729 --> 01:13:51,220
Yep

571
01:13:51,220 --> 01:13:56,439
We could use that

572
01:13:56,520 --> 01:14:02,600
Nice

573
01:14:13,420 --> 01:14:18,699
Um, I can't get I can't get away

574
01:14:24,550 --> 01:14:26,470
Get off of me

575
01:14:26,470 --> 01:15:12,250
Is there a skill tree in this game? I hope there is i've seen people sit there all night staring out that window

576
01:15:13,300 --> 01:15:15,300
hatching out plans

577
01:15:15,300 --> 01:15:18,420
Good clever plans all dead and gone

578
01:15:19,579 --> 01:15:21,579
What are you looking at the bridge?

579
01:15:21,979 --> 01:15:23,340
the gate

580
01:15:23,340 --> 01:15:25,180
Oh, yes

581
01:15:25,180 --> 01:15:27,180
That beautiful gate

582
01:15:27,180 --> 01:15:29,180
Leads straight out of look boards. They say

583
01:15:29,739 --> 01:15:31,739
I feel like if you were

584
01:15:31,739 --> 01:15:35,420
Opening to the chime of a bell. This doesn't sound like frail man

585
01:15:38,649 --> 01:15:43,130
Frail would who lives in the tower be like the master of the black pits

586
01:15:43,850 --> 01:15:49,369
It sounds like put together but you know the orcs just call him candle man

587
01:15:51,829 --> 01:15:54,789
Maybe they think it's him who's light burns in the tower

588
01:15:56,140 --> 01:15:58,859
Alas, there is only one way into the tower of light

589
01:15:59,659 --> 01:16:06,649
The one that our sick friend darrymon took today. He lost his hope long before he lost his life

590
01:16:07,829 --> 01:16:10,069
as most of us do

591
01:16:10,069 --> 01:16:15,989
You're just doing your dark and darker wizard voice for the tower he was obsessed with it

592
01:16:16,550 --> 01:16:19,029
A great collection of maps. He told me

593
01:16:19,670 --> 01:16:25,829
Stored somewhere in the horrors of grond in a building made of steel holes of ground

594
01:16:26,630 --> 01:16:29,829
I could show you the way if you want to see for yourself

595
01:16:30,630 --> 01:16:34,229
Don't listen maggot. No brains left in that old scrag

596
01:16:35,029 --> 01:16:38,949
He's been down here too long. Oh do I have to choose who I want my companion to be?

597
01:16:40,069 --> 01:16:44,310
Me instead. I know how to get around and i'm scrappy too

598
01:16:46,939 --> 01:16:58,199
right

599
01:16:58,359 --> 01:17:10,600
Okay, so what's day two's task?

600
01:17:19,829 --> 01:17:21,829
Is it is it actually get tags

601
01:17:29,539 --> 01:17:39,189
mines, okay

602
01:17:39,189 --> 01:17:42,710
How many days are there? How long?

603
01:17:43,510 --> 01:17:45,880
was golem in

604
01:17:45,880 --> 01:17:48,520
Prison in mordor for wasn't it like decades?

605
01:17:49,159 --> 01:17:55,189
Wasn't he in here for like 25 years?

606
01:17:59,670 --> 01:18:02,359
100 years

607
01:18:03,939 --> 01:18:11,479
I told you how do I get water? I don't have water. What if I get water?

608
01:18:15,319 --> 01:18:17,319
You can't hurt me anymore

609
01:18:18,039 --> 01:18:21,720
Masters can kill masters always finds a way to hurt

610
01:18:25,920 --> 01:18:31,220
Canonically, I think more than one day. I think it was a long long long time

611
01:18:40,659 --> 01:18:42,550
Joe the timer

612
01:18:42,550 --> 01:18:52,140
We've got plenty of time

613
01:18:52,140 --> 01:18:55,180
Now it would have been really funny if okay. This game is like this

614
01:18:55,819 --> 01:19:00,220
But there was actually eight or whatever how long eight years ten years

615
01:19:00,939 --> 01:19:04,060
Five years, how long was it?

616
01:19:04,060 --> 01:19:06,939
Imagine if it was like three thousand days you had to play

617
01:19:07,579 --> 01:19:15,420
That should be kind of funny. All right. What am I allowed to go through?

618
01:19:20,819 --> 01:19:22,819
Special honor for you today

619
01:19:23,220 --> 01:19:29,539
Some of our little crackers didn't go off last night some dirt eater needs to crawl down the tunnels and light them up

620
01:19:30,979 --> 01:19:32,979
Am I gonna explode?

621
01:19:35,060 --> 01:19:38,979
I'm gonna explode down there. Stop staring shaku

622
01:19:41,350 --> 01:19:45,270
I hope there's an opportunity to make a mistake down there. You know what I mean?

623
01:19:45,989 --> 01:19:51,430
That's gonna be really funny slaves. They deem useless. Come on this way take a light

624
01:19:51,989 --> 01:19:53,989
It's going to be dark

625
01:19:56,149 --> 01:19:57,829
How is the game

626
01:19:57,829 --> 01:19:59,829
That's a four

627
01:19:59,989 --> 01:20:01,989
I would say this is like a four or a five

628
01:20:03,109 --> 01:20:05,109
Now they send in the most like five

629
01:20:05,989 --> 01:20:12,869
Workers already place the explosives lighting them. That's the dirt eaters task at the end of the tunnel

630
01:20:13,109 --> 01:20:19,130
You'll find a barrel full of out of ten go down then run for your life

631
01:20:19,850 --> 01:20:27,449
Okay, when you smell the fumes, you'll know why no marks centrist andy strikes again

632
01:20:27,770 --> 01:20:29,770
A five is a failing grade

633
01:20:30,970 --> 01:20:33,340
A five is an f

634
01:20:39,699 --> 01:20:41,220
I'll keep watch

635
01:20:41,220 --> 01:20:45,619
It can't guys. It's not a one a one means you put your name on the top of the paper

636
01:20:46,020 --> 01:20:47,850
You get a one for that

637
01:20:47,850 --> 01:20:50,010
Two is you put in random answers?

638
01:20:50,970 --> 01:20:52,579
right

639
01:20:52,579 --> 01:20:55,460
Three is you got one question, right?

640
01:20:57,859 --> 01:21:02,020
Four is you got like two questions correct, but you tried

641
01:21:04,069 --> 01:21:06,069
Yeah, I all right. Yeah, I think that's fine

642
01:21:10,380 --> 01:21:11,260
guys

643
01:21:11,260 --> 01:21:16,140
Teachers don't hand out ones and twos. They don't I don't know. I haven't been in school for a long time, but

644
01:21:16,779 --> 01:21:20,300
When was the most last time you got a two on your on your paper?

645
01:21:21,939 --> 01:21:27,239
a two

646
01:21:27,800 --> 01:21:39,180
Okay, so I have to light this on fire and then run you got it smells like fowl eggsies

647
01:21:50,140 --> 01:21:52,140
Is it safe to do what i'm doing?

648
01:21:52,300 --> 01:21:56,579
I got it, right? Okay. So when do I have to ignite?

649
01:21:57,140 --> 01:22:03,579
something down here

650
01:22:03,579 --> 01:22:06,859
Most professors give us zero if you don't even write a full page

651
01:22:08,180 --> 01:22:11,510
Wait, what?

652
01:22:11,670 --> 01:22:29,770
I just want to see how long it was. All right, get out now

653
01:22:32,579 --> 01:22:34,420
Why is it so slow?

654
01:22:34,420 --> 01:22:41,460
Why is the music getting oh escape?

655
01:22:41,619 --> 01:22:43,689
escape what

656
01:22:43,689 --> 01:22:45,289
There's no danger

657
01:22:45,289 --> 01:22:52,970
Why is the music playing like this? There's nothing scary going on

658
01:23:06,739 --> 01:23:08,739
Oh, it's gas

659
01:23:10,630 --> 01:23:12,630
I didn't talk about gen loss

660
01:23:12,630 --> 01:23:13,829
We'll do that

661
01:23:13,829 --> 01:23:19,670
Lizzie that saw I was on uh

662
01:23:20,630 --> 01:23:22,869
day two of ranboo's show

663
01:23:24,550 --> 01:23:26,550
It was really fun

664
01:23:26,550 --> 01:23:29,460
It was hold on. This is actually on a timer

665
01:23:34,920 --> 01:23:39,659
Oh shit, it is right there

666
01:23:49,159 --> 01:23:53,979
Secret let's finish these tunnels first come this way

667
01:23:54,619 --> 01:23:57,579
There are more of these garrison things. Uh, yeah, I had uh

668
01:23:58,539 --> 01:24:00,380
Wait, what?

669
01:24:00,380 --> 01:24:07,260
Smeagol wants to go home to the river nice cold river. Well, you can't can you yeah the prosthetics I was in

670
01:24:07,979 --> 01:24:09,979
Uh, i'd never done something like that before

671
01:24:10,699 --> 01:24:11,739
but

672
01:24:11,739 --> 01:24:13,979
I had to get my whole face casted

673
01:24:14,699 --> 01:24:18,699
And the way they do that is they put this stuff all over your face

674
01:24:19,800 --> 01:24:23,399
This like silicone stuff and cover your mouth and your almost your whole head

675
01:24:23,640 --> 01:24:25,800
But not my it didn't do the back of my head or anything

676
01:24:26,119 --> 01:24:31,640
It was just my entire face and I could only breathe very very slightly out of my nostrils

677
01:24:33,670 --> 01:24:36,069
It was it was an experience. It was like, oh shit

678
01:24:37,430 --> 01:24:39,430
and then

679
01:24:39,590 --> 01:24:41,590
They sculpted on that mold

680
01:24:47,430 --> 01:24:49,430
It's really really really cool

681
01:24:52,279 --> 01:24:57,000
Did you shave? Oh, yeah, I had to there's no way it would have actually been a bliss day on my face

682
01:24:57,930 --> 01:24:59,529
Oh, I gotta go now

683
01:24:59,529 --> 01:25:07,859
Did you get to keep the mold? Yes. I actually did i'll show it

684
01:25:08,640 --> 01:25:09,939
um

685
01:25:09,939 --> 01:25:13,859
Unfortunately, it is not here. I need to get it. I need to get it sent to me

686
01:25:16,470 --> 01:25:18,470
But I will show it. It's terrifying

687
01:25:20,460 --> 01:25:25,260
It's just a one-to-one complete replica of my face with every pore

688
01:25:26,220 --> 01:25:27,420
every

689
01:25:27,420 --> 01:25:29,829
every wrinkle

690
01:25:29,909 --> 01:25:35,109
It is a snapshot of my exact face as a 37 year old man

691
01:25:43,989 --> 01:25:45,989
Sell it, uh, nope

692
01:25:47,510 --> 01:25:49,510
No fucking way

693
01:25:50,229 --> 01:25:55,720
No fucking way here finish the last tunnel then meet me back upstairs at the cages

694
01:25:56,680 --> 01:25:58,600
I ain't selling that

695
01:25:58,600 --> 01:26:00,600
There ain't no price on that one

696
01:26:12,890 --> 01:26:14,890
You could make bank selling it

697
01:26:17,340 --> 01:26:22,699
There is no world where i'm gonna be super happy and like, oh, yeah, that's that's awesome

698
01:26:23,180 --> 01:26:25,180
Yeah, so new merch drop guys

699
01:26:25,739 --> 01:26:28,060
a one-to-one complete replica

700
01:26:28,699 --> 01:26:30,699
down to the pores

701
01:26:31,399 --> 01:26:33,659
Identical of my face

702
01:26:35,199 --> 01:26:36,810
complete

703
01:26:36,810 --> 01:26:38,569
better than hd

704
01:26:38,569 --> 01:26:42,569
Real life. It's like real life. It's better than hd. It's real life

705
01:26:43,659 --> 01:26:47,529
I'm not selling that

706
01:26:47,529 --> 01:26:51,130
Have you tried using face id with your phone with the mold?

707
01:26:53,380 --> 01:26:57,909
That's actually kind of funny, but no, I would not i'm not gonna sell that

708
01:27:01,909 --> 01:27:03,909
No fucking way

709
01:27:13,159 --> 01:27:18,789
In 2 000 years, they'll dig it up and reconstruct you no i'm smashing it with a hammer before I die

710
01:27:19,989 --> 01:27:22,340
Do you know what I mean?

711
01:27:22,340 --> 01:27:24,180
like before I die

712
01:27:24,180 --> 01:27:29,619
One of my requests in my will is smash that fucking one-to-one realistic face

713
01:27:30,970 --> 01:27:33,130
Smash it with a hammer to a million pieces

714
01:27:42,600 --> 01:27:45,560
Give it to your grandkids. No, they're not getting shit

715
01:27:46,970 --> 01:27:51,130
That sounded bad. That sounded bad. I mean they'll i'll get why can I go in here?

716
01:27:54,140 --> 01:27:58,220
That sounded kind of bad. I mean, they're not gonna get any like weird shit like that

717
01:27:59,020 --> 01:28:00,550
They'll get

718
01:28:00,550 --> 01:28:02,550
They'll get money

719
01:28:03,109 --> 01:28:05,109
Whatever's left I guess

720
01:28:12,649 --> 01:28:14,890
I'll get some money, right?

721
01:28:18,890 --> 01:28:23,210
They'll see what I have left and they'll be like why did grandpa do all this shit?

722
01:28:25,220 --> 01:28:28,979
How much money did he have and you're telling wait he put on a dollhouse

723
01:28:29,699 --> 01:28:32,649
What the fuck are you talking about?

724
01:28:34,779 --> 01:28:36,779
Where's the money?

725
01:28:37,739 --> 01:28:40,550
And they send you into the light

726
01:28:40,789 --> 01:28:43,989
That's when you can sleep. What did you spend? You you spent seventy

727
01:28:44,609 --> 01:28:50,539
Thousand dollars on the family guy game grandpa. What the fuck are you doing? Why didn't you just give it to us?

728
01:29:05,819 --> 01:29:07,819
Get a gold cast of the mask

729
01:29:11,659 --> 01:29:17,260
Oh, that's a brilliant idea put the inheritance inside of the face mold so they have to smash it to get it

730
01:29:19,189 --> 01:29:21,189
Here is better here

731
01:29:24,439 --> 01:29:26,439
Remember the dwarves I mentioned earlier

732
01:29:27,640 --> 01:29:33,979
One of them told me something once those buildings out there above the bridge make a gold bust of your face

733
01:29:34,539 --> 01:29:36,300
That'd be so funny

734
01:29:36,300 --> 01:29:40,619
But that would be a lot of money while he knew where the guards watch if oh shit

735
01:29:41,180 --> 01:29:43,659
Now we're good and hide them in a cave near the bridge

736
01:29:44,539 --> 01:29:47,979
Just one stone each day so the guards wouldn't notice

737
01:29:48,619 --> 01:29:52,699
Why why do you think what happened?

738
01:29:53,579 --> 01:29:54,859
well

739
01:29:54,859 --> 01:29:56,859
One day he slipped and fell

740
01:29:57,800 --> 01:29:59,800
Yeah, that's not a nice story

741
01:30:00,840 --> 01:30:02,840
I suppose not

742
01:30:03,239 --> 01:30:08,229
That's all i'm saying

743
01:30:09,189 --> 01:30:11,189
I'm going to go back

744
01:30:28,380 --> 01:30:31,699
Um, what do you think you're talking to?

745
01:30:31,939 --> 01:30:35,460
Awkward sleep more quiet if we was his friend

746
01:30:36,579 --> 01:30:38,579
Is that a threat?

747
01:30:39,300 --> 01:30:42,260
Are you threatening me? What are you gonna do?

748
01:30:49,180 --> 01:30:56,600
Oh that I guess

749
01:30:58,489 --> 01:31:08,569
Days later knocked you out for days

750
01:31:22,979 --> 01:31:25,460
Stay close to me. I can show you

751
01:31:26,939 --> 01:31:30,859
This isn't very good

752
01:31:30,859 --> 01:31:35,180
I I thought it was gonna be I was gonna be running around outside and hiding in bushes and

753
01:31:35,979 --> 01:31:38,460
I don't know why it's gonna be doing tasks

754
01:31:44,550 --> 01:31:46,789
I could see if this was a section of the game

755
01:31:52,869 --> 01:31:58,630
Is this the whole game

756
01:32:01,590 --> 01:32:03,590
Yeah

757
01:32:04,630 --> 01:32:06,659
Uh

758
01:32:06,659 --> 01:32:09,960
Is the story any good?

759
01:32:09,960 --> 01:32:11,960
I mean, it's hard to tell

760
01:32:15,270 --> 01:32:22,630
When you realize your relatives have to smash both your head and the bust of your head when you die

761
01:32:23,350 --> 01:32:24,789
Oh, that's true

762
01:32:24,789 --> 01:32:27,699
That's true

763
01:32:27,699 --> 01:32:30,020
No, I didn't there's a lot of new people here. I think

764
01:32:30,819 --> 01:32:32,500
Do you guys remember that?

765
01:32:32,500 --> 01:32:37,100
Should we talk about that really quick? Um, okay, so

766
01:32:39,159 --> 01:32:41,659
When okay, let's talk

767
01:32:41,659 --> 01:32:42,939
When you die

768
01:32:42,939 --> 01:32:44,939
Nobody really knows what happens

769
01:32:45,180 --> 01:32:47,180
but there's this prospect

770
01:32:47,899 --> 01:32:49,340
that your brain

771
01:32:49,340 --> 01:32:51,340
Is kind of still going

772
01:32:51,579 --> 01:32:54,199
You're kind of still going and just

773
01:32:54,840 --> 01:32:56,819
What happens in there?

774
01:32:56,819 --> 01:32:59,449
Does time slow down?

775
01:32:59,529 --> 01:33:01,529
In your head and do you essentially live?

776
01:33:01,989 --> 01:33:03,210
potentially

777
01:33:03,210 --> 01:33:08,329
Hundreds of years up here because of just like you're kind of dying and you're going and you're but you know what i'm saying

778
01:33:08,810 --> 01:33:11,369
There's been theories. There's been theories about this

779
01:33:12,010 --> 01:33:19,819
That like maybe your brain is actually still active for a while and who knows how long you'd be trapped up there for so

780
01:33:20,539 --> 01:33:27,819
I don't know. What if I like don't want to be in there? So I made it a jokey reference to the second that I flatline

781
01:33:28,630 --> 01:33:30,520
like

782
01:33:30,520 --> 01:33:32,520
Because it could be a thousand years at that point

783
01:33:32,680 --> 01:33:35,800
You know what i'm saying? Like that one second could be a thousand years after that

784
01:33:36,359 --> 01:33:40,840
I just crushed my head with a cinder block the second that it's like

785
01:33:43,100 --> 01:33:45,739
What the fuck what what did just make the noise I just made

786
01:33:47,050 --> 01:33:50,779
What the hell?

787
01:33:50,779 --> 01:33:52,779
Stay away from her you imbecile

788
01:33:57,380 --> 01:34:00,020
Can you imagine it's in his will you don't understand

789
01:34:00,819 --> 01:34:06,340
I'm going to send you. Yeah, uncle. Uncle frank has to run in with a cinder block. No, you don't understand. It's in his will

790
01:34:06,340 --> 01:34:09,289
We have to crush his head

791
01:34:09,529 --> 01:34:12,569
Somebody get security. No, i'm sitting there in there

792
01:34:16,439 --> 01:34:18,439
You're under arrest uncle frank

793
01:34:20,460 --> 01:34:23,100
No, shit, i'm sorry jeremy. I tried

794
01:34:23,899 --> 01:34:29,819
The feeds the beasts of mordor when you leave the ditch you'll see the rattler

795
01:34:30,300 --> 01:34:32,300
The hoist with all the bones remember

796
01:34:32,699 --> 01:34:35,260
The rattler will take you up to the halls of grond

797
01:34:36,229 --> 01:34:38,979
If you ever get there alive

798
01:34:38,979 --> 01:34:40,979
Who knows just open this for you

799
01:34:42,859 --> 01:34:45,659
Why do we sleep right? What the fuck is going on?

800
01:34:46,380 --> 01:34:47,979
Why do we sleep?

801
01:34:47,979 --> 01:34:50,619
What do we do? We just disconnect from the network

802
01:34:51,420 --> 01:34:53,340
for hours at a time

803
01:34:53,340 --> 01:34:55,100
Why do we sleep?

804
01:34:55,100 --> 01:34:58,779
Our brains have to turn off. We get we get disconnected from the network

805
01:35:01,399 --> 01:35:03,399
What did I how did I die? Did I die?

806
01:35:03,800 --> 01:35:04,600
Oh

807
01:35:04,600 --> 01:35:14,260
It's rest and restoration

808
01:35:14,970 --> 01:35:21,850
Yeah, but isn't that so interesting that our brains effectively are a battery that has to be recharged at the end of a of a 20

809
01:35:22,010 --> 01:35:23,609
hour period

810
01:35:23,609 --> 01:35:29,180
You have an iphone battery there. That's interesting. It's incredibly interesting

811
01:35:32,250 --> 01:35:56,979
What's down here? Is there anything I need to get up here? What's the timer? We got plenty of time. Relax

812
01:36:00,760 --> 01:36:02,760
No one said it was like an iphone battery

813
01:36:05,670 --> 01:36:09,670
I I did I don't mean you have an iphone battery into your brain

814
01:36:09,750 --> 01:36:12,949
I just mean isn't it interesting that we have to turn off to recharge?

815
01:36:13,029 --> 01:36:17,270
We have to literally plug ourselves in to a different network to recharge ourselves

816
01:36:18,149 --> 01:36:20,149
I don't have to explain myself

817
01:36:20,310 --> 01:36:47,180
Can they get me?

818
01:36:47,180 --> 01:36:51,899
You don't come down here, right? Do you will you jump after me? You kind of don't even look scary

819
01:36:52,779 --> 01:37:00,359
It's kind of nice actually

820
01:37:00,359 --> 01:37:04,579
I've heard it compared to clearing

821
01:37:05,260 --> 01:37:08,090
Where am I?

822
01:37:08,090 --> 01:37:09,369
What's going on?

823
01:37:09,369 --> 01:37:13,239
Where the fuck am I? What is going on?

824
01:37:13,960 --> 01:37:16,899
Am I underwater?

825
01:37:16,899 --> 01:37:17,880
Um

826
01:37:17,880 --> 01:37:22,090
What how did I get in here?

827
01:37:22,649 --> 01:37:24,649
Where the fuck am I going?

828
01:37:32,760 --> 01:37:34,760
Okay, that was

829
01:37:34,760 --> 01:37:41,029
That was very weird

830
01:37:41,270 --> 01:37:42,229
Okay

831
01:37:42,229 --> 01:37:44,229
I got the camera went

832
01:37:44,930 --> 01:37:53,250
freezing

833
01:37:53,729 --> 01:38:01,970
Yeah

834
01:38:06,130 --> 01:38:08,689
What

835
01:38:09,270 --> 01:38:11,350
What the fuck is going on here, okay

836
01:38:13,300 --> 01:38:23,029
So far away

837
01:38:31,430 --> 01:38:46,149
Guys did golem win the argument or did schmigel it was schmigel. I'm a good guy

838
01:38:46,949 --> 01:39:09,029
Oh fuck a category

839
01:39:09,430 --> 01:39:15,109
Caragor

840
01:39:15,750 --> 01:39:17,750
Blasted caragors

841
01:39:18,069 --> 01:39:28,119
What if he watches us the dark lord?

842
01:39:28,520 --> 01:39:30,199
What he sees

843
01:39:30,199 --> 01:39:35,960
A tiny schmigel so many things for him to watch mountains enemies spies

844
01:39:36,439 --> 01:39:38,920
No lord is looking for the precious

845
01:39:39,479 --> 01:39:43,000
He wants it wants it. Who is he talking to?

846
01:39:43,720 --> 01:39:45,720
Okay

847
01:39:46,199 --> 01:39:53,319
We must do what the lord says what he says. Yes, but he says save the precious and who has the precious

848
01:39:54,520 --> 01:39:56,520
Baggins baggins

849
01:39:57,319 --> 01:40:00,600
Not here. Is it the nasty trixie hobbit?

850
01:40:01,319 --> 01:40:04,439
How can we protect the precious when it's so far away?

851
01:40:06,039 --> 01:40:07,880
We got 20 minutes

852
01:40:07,880 --> 01:40:10,800
I think that's enough to get to act

853
01:40:10,800 --> 01:40:12,560
Three where we're going

854
01:40:12,560 --> 01:40:16,680
I must be patient my dear must be very very

855
01:40:16,680 --> 01:40:18,680
Be careful

856
01:40:19,560 --> 01:40:25,569
Wait, I don't have to get in there

857
01:40:25,569 --> 01:40:30,770
20 minutes for what 20 minutes until um, i'm gonna determine if i'm gonna play the game anymore

858
01:40:31,329 --> 01:40:38,680
This is nice. This is cool

859
01:40:38,680 --> 01:40:41,880
I know that was my fucking centrist voice, but just please

860
01:40:44,079 --> 01:40:46,079
It did it that it was

861
01:40:46,079 --> 01:41:07,699
Can somebody give me a rundown of the entire lord of the kings story?

862
01:41:10,069 --> 01:41:12,069
Well, it's lord of the it's this

863
01:41:14,710 --> 01:41:17,029
I don't think I could even tell you what happens in lord of the rings

864
01:41:17,840 --> 01:41:23,439
I probably could but i'm gonna get a name wrong. I'm gonna get a time period wrong and people are going to scream at me

865
01:41:34,439 --> 01:41:36,869
i'll try

866
01:41:38,399 --> 01:41:40,720
Like 10 000 years ago

867
01:41:41,779 --> 01:41:43,279
there was this

868
01:41:43,279 --> 01:41:44,659
monster

869
01:41:44,659 --> 01:41:49,380
It was a elf. No, it wasn't a monster yet. His name was sauron

870
01:41:49,859 --> 01:41:51,359
He's an elf

871
01:41:51,359 --> 01:41:58,760
He had a buddy that made shit. It was a blacksmith. His name was kela brimbor. So sauron says to kela brimbor

872
01:41:59,569 --> 01:42:00,449
Hey

873
01:42:00,449 --> 01:42:04,369
What's up, dude? So here's what we're gonna do. We're gonna make a bunch of rings

874
01:42:05,090 --> 01:42:10,609
Rings of power because we want to you know, obviously the world we have to make sure we keep it in balance and everybody needs to

875
01:42:10,609 --> 01:42:13,890
Have this powerful things and powerful jewelry in case we have to fight

876
01:42:13,890 --> 01:42:18,369
We can you know, shoot fucking beams at each other from the lasers from the ring whatever we do

877
01:42:18,770 --> 01:42:20,850
So now there's a bunch of powerful rings

878
01:42:21,250 --> 01:42:26,609
So they made a bunch of them and they were different, you know all the different people though that were on earth

879
01:42:26,770 --> 01:42:28,689
Whatever this place is called

880
01:42:28,689 --> 01:42:33,430
So you've got nine went to the humans six went to the dwarves

881
01:42:34,600 --> 01:42:36,600
12 went to the elves

882
01:42:36,840 --> 01:42:40,359
And then five were put in storage in case they were you know

883
01:42:40,359 --> 01:42:43,479
Just in case there was more needed later on down the road just in case anybody else wanted more

884
01:42:44,199 --> 01:42:46,359
in secret

885
01:42:46,359 --> 01:42:49,640
Sauron made kela brimbor make another ring

886
01:42:50,279 --> 01:42:54,439
Essentially all those other rings I talked about were fake. They weren't like that strong. They weren't really that cool

887
01:42:54,600 --> 01:43:00,279
They didn't have like the fucking serious drip that the one ring has so sauron asked kela brimbor to make

888
01:43:00,520 --> 01:43:07,640
An and a super powered ring in secret in private. So kela brimbor says, oh this is

889
01:43:08,279 --> 01:43:10,680
Uncalled for so after he makes it

890
01:43:11,399 --> 01:43:15,800
um sauron punches him in the face with the ring and he does like this ring punch and it's just

891
01:43:16,680 --> 01:43:23,329
Like shatters his skull and kills kela brimbor. So he can't tell anybody the real secret. So sauron goes on to

892
01:43:23,970 --> 01:43:25,409
essentially destroy

893
01:43:25,409 --> 01:43:29,010
Um all of middle earth he kills everybody and it takes over there everyone's like what the fuck's going on

894
01:43:29,010 --> 01:43:31,250
Our rings aren't even good. Our rings aren't even powerful

895
01:43:35,239 --> 01:43:36,439
and that's

896
01:43:36,439 --> 01:43:38,210
where

897
01:43:38,210 --> 01:43:43,510
uh bill bow baggins gets it eventually and

898
01:43:44,310 --> 01:43:48,869
They have it's like hey this ring is too strong. We have somebody has to we have to destroy it somehow

899
01:43:49,909 --> 01:43:52,630
You gotta be fucking kidding me. Like this is not even that far

900
01:44:00,579 --> 01:44:02,579
This is really not that far of a drop

901
01:44:03,479 --> 01:44:11,460
Right, what?

902
01:44:11,460 --> 01:44:14,279
You skipped three votes

903
01:44:14,359 --> 01:44:16,359
All right, so then bill bow baggins

904
01:44:16,930 --> 01:44:18,609
ends up meeting

905
01:44:18,609 --> 01:44:19,810
golem

906
01:44:19,810 --> 01:44:24,050
Who at some point the ring gets lost because I don't fucking know

907
01:44:24,449 --> 01:44:28,130
There's a big battle and sauron loses. He gets his finger cut off

908
01:44:28,850 --> 01:44:32,689
And during that whole process it falls down a well and goes down into this rocky area

909
01:44:33,489 --> 01:44:35,489
And golem finds it

910
01:44:36,289 --> 01:44:41,649
Golem puts it on and for like a hundred years is like the coolest person in fucking mordor

911
01:44:43,279 --> 01:44:46,930
This is a stealth game

912
01:44:46,930 --> 01:44:48,210
so

913
01:44:48,210 --> 01:44:49,489
eventually

914
01:44:49,489 --> 01:44:53,300
Eventually frodo

915
01:44:53,300 --> 01:44:55,300
No, I don't know

916
01:44:55,779 --> 01:44:58,020
I could tell i'm i'm paying attention to something else

917
01:44:59,199 --> 01:45:01,199
Okay, so bill bow baggins

918
01:45:01,810 --> 01:45:04,159
Has the ring

919
01:45:04,159 --> 01:45:06,319
Oh shit, this happens before frodo is first

920
01:45:06,399 --> 01:45:10,479
No, frodo is after because he's like an older guy and he does that. Let's try to get the ring off his neck

921
01:45:14,550 --> 01:45:17,590
Turns out okay. No, hold on. I don't want to get caught here

922
01:45:18,800 --> 01:45:21,199
Turns out six of the rings were very powerful

923
01:45:21,840 --> 01:45:28,640
And what they end up doing is the humans the dwarves the elves they all come together and they put their rings together

924
01:45:29,279 --> 01:45:33,279
And they summon what is effectively captain planet. It's um, it's gandalf

925
01:45:34,260 --> 01:45:37,060
When gandalf ends up like cleaning up a bunch of litter and stuff

926
01:45:37,539 --> 01:45:41,939
And tells everybody to you know, cut the shit and make sure you recycle your fucking plastic bottles

927
01:45:43,140 --> 01:45:45,140
And then he oh my god

928
01:45:53,199 --> 01:46:23,029
There's no way to get out of here

929
01:46:35,909 --> 01:46:44,949
Is he gonna see me can you hear this

930
01:46:45,430 --> 01:46:48,710
This

931
01:46:48,710 --> 01:46:50,710
It takes way too long to kill somebody

932
01:46:51,350 --> 01:47:10,600
It lights off

933
01:47:10,600 --> 01:47:19,810
Did I make it? Oh fuck. No, i'm good

934
01:47:20,449 --> 01:47:22,449
Oh, come on. Where the hell do I go?

935
01:47:23,699 --> 01:47:27,829
You gotta be kidding me

936
01:47:27,829 --> 01:47:31,350
What about sourman? Oh, that's right. So during this whole process

937
01:47:32,310 --> 01:47:34,470
There's there are many wizards, right? There is

938
01:47:35,189 --> 01:47:37,189
the two blue wizards

939
01:47:37,350 --> 01:47:41,189
There's the one gray wizard. There's the brown wizard. There is the

940
01:47:42,609 --> 01:47:46,529
Um, I don't saruman is the white saruman the white right

941
01:47:47,560 --> 01:47:50,159
Radagast the brown

942
01:47:50,159 --> 01:47:53,239
There's like five of them

943
01:47:53,239 --> 01:47:57,000
And only one of them really gives a shit about anything and it's gandalf the others don't care

944
01:47:57,239 --> 01:47:58,760
The others actually don't give a shit about anything

945
01:47:58,760 --> 01:48:03,319
They have to be convinced to give a fuck and it takes all the way to the very end of the entire franchise before they actually care

946
01:48:03,560 --> 01:48:13,250
That one's true

947
01:48:13,250 --> 01:48:21,569
Is there a way to actually don't think I can go this way? Maybe I have to lure him over here

948
01:48:23,300 --> 01:48:25,300
Any news on the black legion?

949
01:48:25,460 --> 01:48:29,640
Marching to dolgul door soon. That's what kushnach says

950
01:48:31,399 --> 01:48:33,880
The targs is doing proudly on our doorstep

951
01:48:35,239 --> 01:48:37,399
Not for long

952
01:48:37,399 --> 01:48:43,479
So anyways sourman ends up this is spoilers for the lord of the rings, by the way, if you don't care and whatever

953
01:48:53,890 --> 01:48:57,939
I um, you know what we're gonna play street fighter in 12 minutes. Anyways

954
01:49:11,439 --> 01:49:15,859
It doesn't matter if you get the spoilers completely wrong. Yeah, that's true

955
01:49:16,420 --> 01:49:26,689
But anyways, there's a mountain that they can get rid of the one ring to make sure nobody gets powerful and corrupted ever again

956
01:49:27,329 --> 01:49:30,979
What they don't know is this is a fantasy universe

957
01:49:31,619 --> 01:49:34,500
At all you invest we all very very clear and as we all know

958
01:49:34,979 --> 01:49:39,460
They could just open up a fucking portal somewhere and it doesn't matter. They'll do it again

959
01:49:40,020 --> 01:49:44,100
You know what? I mean, they'll just open up a fucking portal. So that's all that matters eventually

960
01:50:08,310 --> 01:50:11,699
He's shooting me with a fucking

961
01:50:12,420 --> 01:50:13,880
Okay

962
01:50:13,880 --> 01:50:17,800
I don't want to play this game anymore. I don't want to play this game just to keep the countdown up

963
01:50:20,289 --> 01:50:23,890
It's stuff. It's stealth. There's what is worse than stealth encounters?

964
01:50:26,239 --> 01:50:32,800
I could do it

965
01:50:32,800 --> 01:50:34,850
No, if I could just

966
01:50:34,850 --> 01:50:41,750
Yeah, this is like the lover. Glover was actually good. This is not

967
01:50:42,470 --> 01:50:43,829
This is bad

968
01:50:43,829 --> 01:50:46,449
But sorry, I can do it

969
01:50:48,710 --> 01:50:51,909
No shit, okay. I just don't want to play this

970
01:50:55,960 --> 01:50:59,989
This is obviously wrong so let me run him back here

971
01:51:04,289 --> 01:51:06,289
Is there anybody go that's when I jump up here

972
01:51:08,210 --> 01:51:18,239
There's got to be a way I can hide in here or something, right? I don't I mean is this guy just stupid

973
01:51:22,020 --> 01:51:24,260
That was dumb that was kind of unfair

974
01:51:32,760 --> 01:51:50,949
All right, it's time to play street fighter six am I hidden? Oh my god, I am hidden

975
01:52:02,399 --> 01:52:09,720
That was weird

976
01:52:09,720 --> 01:52:12,920
Shut the fuck up. There's no come give me a break, dude

977
01:52:13,960 --> 01:52:15,239
You go

978
01:52:15,239 --> 01:52:18,630
Is he still looking? No, we're good. All right. All right. I finally made it

979
01:52:19,430 --> 01:52:36,659
um

980
01:52:36,659 --> 01:52:37,619
Nice

981
01:52:37,619 --> 01:52:43,380
Can I dump this?

982
01:52:48,050 --> 01:52:51,250
No, I can't

983
01:52:56,600 --> 01:52:57,880
There it is

984
01:52:57,880 --> 01:53:26,800
I think I can get there in just one go. Well, I'm done. Goodbye. I actually can't do this again. I refuse to do this again

985
01:53:27,989 --> 01:53:29,430
That sucks

986
01:53:29,510 --> 01:53:32,630
And am I doing it for a joke half the time maybe

987
01:53:33,189 --> 01:53:35,750
Probably subconsciously I would say I think that's correct

988
01:53:43,840 --> 01:53:45,840
God damn it. I

989
01:53:46,319 --> 01:53:58,149
How much time is left seven minutes? This is where vinnie gave up on the game, too

990
01:54:00,260 --> 01:54:02,420
Really? So nobody knows what happens after this

991
01:54:03,380 --> 01:54:05,060
Has anyone gotten that far?

992
01:54:05,060 --> 01:54:17,840
Okay, we're good

993
01:54:17,840 --> 01:54:20,000
Don't be stupid this time

994
01:54:27,909 --> 01:54:47,720
What do you go investigate the rock go investigate the rock he did it last time

995
01:54:49,600 --> 01:54:56,069
You gotta be kidding me. Now what throw it at? Oh that thing. Yeah, you mean

996
01:55:04,609 --> 01:55:06,609
Can't grab me now, can you?

997
01:55:06,609 --> 01:55:24,180
Okay. Now this time just don't jump off and die instantly go do it the right way if I hold go here drop here

998
01:55:25,380 --> 01:55:27,159
Okay

999
01:55:27,159 --> 01:55:29,560
Very cool, and I don't I can't die here

1000
01:55:30,720 --> 01:55:31,840
so

1001
01:55:31,840 --> 01:55:34,159
Be very very careful. Don't be stupid

1002
01:55:39,239 --> 01:55:54,560
Goodness, um, oh my god

1003
01:55:54,960 --> 01:55:56,079
Ah

1004
01:55:56,079 --> 01:55:59,939
I thought I was gonna I don't know I was gonna try to break his neck

1005
01:56:01,859 --> 01:56:03,859
Yeah, that's it. I'm done

1006
01:56:03,859 --> 01:56:06,020
Right on time

1007
01:56:06,020 --> 01:56:07,779
Right on time

1008
01:56:07,779 --> 01:56:20,529
We're good. So what I want to do in street fighter is I want to do the open world single player mode

1009
01:56:22,069 --> 01:56:25,989
It was I tried the demo. All right, that's fun. Yeah

1010
01:56:26,789 --> 01:56:38,100
That was the lord of the rings golems adventure. I just want to check it out. See how it was you like stealth

1011
01:56:38,500 --> 01:56:41,939

Yeah, I can't you like, um

stealth based adventure games if you're a fan of lord of the rings, uh, read the books and

1016
01:57:06,439 --> 01:57:11,590

Get the get the prequel book and read that one. And I mean shadow of war or shadow of war is great

1018
01:57:22,180 --> 01:57:24,449
Those are really cool
