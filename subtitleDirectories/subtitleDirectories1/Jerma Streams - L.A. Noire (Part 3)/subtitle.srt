1
00:00:06,459 --> 00:00:46,259
So did you see the title? Yeah, I got my save. I actually just had to go into the PlayStation account settings downloaded the cloud save because I just have my PlayStation gym membership. Right? You just forget that it exists. It just takes out what $10 a month forever. Even if you don't go and work out it still happens. So I was able to have my save. So give me a second while people trickle in.

2
00:00:46,299 --> 00:02:00,489
See you in a sec. I just saw somebody say maybe he won't play Minecraft this time. Well, I mean, come on, like I was also drinking heavily that night. So what? I drunkenly played Minecraft. That didn't that I didn't whatever. I remember the last mission that I was on here. I have a distinct memory of walking around in a circle not knowing how to go down to the crash.

3
00:02:00,569 --> 00:03:01,949
And I finally figured it out. And now we're moving on to the next part. I'll give you a quick rundown of the story so far hasn't gotten over ruined Kim's Minecraft world. No, that's that's that's in the cloud, man. That's we're good. All right, I gotta move my mic a little bit because I'm trying to trying to increase the volume here. Hold on. Try and find like the right spot where this is not obstructing any view, but it's also good quality. Okay, so let's go like this.

4
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:49,810
And we go like this. And there it is. Make sure it's synced. I know that's been a problem recently. Bring back the headset mic. No. Why on earth would I do that? All right, so here's, here's what you guys have to tell me. So you ready? I'm going to go like this up and down. And you should be hearing a click right when it switches and highlights a different option. Okay. Good. All right, now I'm going to match my voice with it. Ready? 121231231234. We good?

5
00:03:49,849 --> 00:04:41,910
Voice is a smidge delayed. Okay, I'll try one more time. 1212312341234. Big delay. Big. So my voice comes after is what you're saying. Because this is an issue I've had recently. So the voice. So it's ready. How about this one? Ready? 121234123412345123412345.

6
00:04:42,470 --> 00:05:32,560
All right, it's good. How about now? 1234551212345512. A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, G, K, N, F, E, Q, R, S, N, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Are we okay? How about one more time? Can you guys tell? We're good, right? All right, let's go. Welcome back to LA. Oh, never mind. We're going to cut. So I forgot to tell you. I got to tell you the story so far. Wait a minute.

7
00:05:35,339 --> 00:05:52,500
I can't pause it, can I? Okay, so this case, there was a crash. Somebody went sailing off the edge. Might have been intentional. Somebody weighed down the pedal. There was an actress involved. There's an ad when the actress is in the car and she might know more than she thinks.

8
00:05:53,139 --> 00:06:01,060
Bang, they fly off. I'm going to visit the other lady that was in the car to see if I get more information because man, this might have been a fucking murder attempt. You know what I'm saying?

9
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:13,420
Hello, Detective Phelps. I'm here to interview a Jessica Hamilton.

10
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:19,220
Jessica Hamilton. Oh, yes. She's in the room.

11
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:21,220
You were drunk. Yes, I was.

12
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:23,459
You can't hold me here.

13
00:06:23,459 --> 00:06:25,459
We're going to talk to Hamilton.

14
00:06:25,459 --> 00:06:29,769
I don't need to be manhandled by a doctor. I need my lawyer.

15
00:06:29,769 --> 00:06:33,769
You're little. Where is the telephone? Do you know who I am?

16
00:06:33,769 --> 00:06:35,939
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Who's talking?

17
00:06:35,939 --> 00:06:40,360
All right, Jessica, how are you feeling?

18
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:43,879
Hello, Jessica. My name is Paul Phelps.

19
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:49,500
Hard going back here after Red Dead. We might play Red Dead tonight. I don't know.

20
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,629
I'd like to talk to you about your accident, if that's okay?

21
00:06:52,629 --> 00:06:54,870
Okay.

22
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:58,870
Okay, so remember, here's where I can review. Here's the evidence, okay?

23
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:05,240
There was a Chevy Steinlein. Boom, off the edge. The victims in that car may have been drugged.

24
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:09,240
Somebody sent a letter to her really worried about her and wants her to come home.

25
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:13,240
There was underwear. There was a pair of underwear that I found and I picked them up.

26
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:17,240
Then there was a shrunken head that was weighing down the pedal of the car that went off the edge.

27
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:23,240
Remember, actress, not an actress, but might be at some point, might be a protege to the other actress.

28
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,240
I'm ready.

29
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,439
Can you tell me what you remember about the crash?

30
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:33,319
It's all kind of fuzzy. I remember waking up here.

31
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:35,319
Nothing happened yesterday.

32
00:07:35,319 --> 00:07:42,600
Okay, so she looks a little distraught.

33
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,600
I'm going to, let's, we're going to ease into this.

34
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,600
You could have died in the crash, Jessica.

35
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,600
Why would someone want to kill you?

36
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,029
Someone wants to kill me?

37
00:07:51,029 --> 00:07:52,029
Got it.

38
00:07:52,029 --> 00:07:58,339
I wouldn't know anything about that. I just went along with Junie. She knows all about the movie business.

39
00:07:58,339 --> 00:08:05,579
See? Okay, so her parents sent her a letter. She might lie to me here.

40
00:08:05,579 --> 00:08:10,740
She looks pretty, yeah, she looks a little distraught. Let's talk about the parents.

41
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:13,740
You need to get in touch with your parents, Jessica, and tell them what has happened.

42
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:17,740
Oh, you don't need to worry them. They sent me along to stay with Aunt June.

43
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:18,740
It's a lie.

44
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:20,740
They trust her to take care of me.

45
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:28,550
That's not true. I can accuse her. I can show the letter, right? Or should I bad cop this?

46
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:36,179
Or is that just doubt? Because, I mean, I do have the letter from Mom saying, come home.

47
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:42,730
You're lying, Jessica. How are we going to make this right if you lie to us?

48
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:46,539
Please, detective, why would I lie to you?

49
00:08:46,539 --> 00:08:51,320
I got the letter to prove it. There.

50
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:56,840
Because you're a runaway, Jessica, and you don't have your parents' permission to be here.

51
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,840
Now, do you want to tell me what really happened?

52
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,210
Got it.

53
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:04,210
I went with June to this strange place. It's difficult to remember.

54
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:08,210
Someone gave me a drink to calm my nerves, and then I felt faint.

55
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:11,210
I think I must have passed out.

56
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:13,220
Okay.

57
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:17,250
So, how did you meet Mr. Bishop?

58
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:19,250
Mr. Bishop is the guy that is involved.

59
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:25,250
June is a big movie star. You probably know that. She's doing a new movie.

60
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:30,509
No, that's a lie. Hold on, wait, is that a lie?

61
00:09:30,509 --> 00:09:36,629
Was she in a movie? Was she in like a new movie coming up?

62
00:09:36,629 --> 00:09:43,049
I think she was. I think that's, yeah, she was in a movie.

63
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:45,860
What do you know about Bishop?

64
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:46,860
I don't remember.

65
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:49,860
He makes movies. I had to do a screen test.

66
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:50,860
Movies don't exist in the past.

67
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:55,860
That's when you say some lines in front of the camera with the lights turned on you.

68
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:58,860
Okay, what about criminal abuse?

69
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:04,539
I know what happened to you, Jessica. Where exactly did it take place?

70
00:10:04,539 --> 00:10:10,539
Please, it's scary. It's really difficult to think of anything.

71
00:10:10,539 --> 00:10:13,779
Come on. Come on.

72
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:25,190
What about, uh, this is me on the green screen.

73
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:27,750
We need the information.

74
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:29,750
Someone tried to kill you, Jessica. Do you get it?

75
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:32,750
Forget about being in movies. It's time to act like a grown-up.

76
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:37,700
I had to wear a robe and lay down on a stone.

77
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:41,940
There were lights, camera. It's not my fault.

78
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:42,940
I'm not a bad girl.

79
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:43,940
Tell us where he is.

80
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:45,940
Why are you trying to hurt me?

81
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:46,940
Tell us where he is.

82
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:47,940
You should think about going home, Jessica.

83
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:48,940
One of four, correct?

84
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:51,940
We're going to be mixed up with people who will treat you like last week's trash.

85
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:52,940
What?

86
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:56,940
Are you crazy? I can't go home. I want to be a star.

87
00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:06,129
How? I got the letter from the mom. She wants to be in movies.

88
00:11:06,129 --> 00:11:10,129
It's the tale of this town, Cole. Lambs that go willingly to slaughter.

89
00:11:10,129 --> 00:11:12,129
Who the hell is that?

90
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:15,129
Must be her lawyer. He certainly expedited her release.

91
00:11:15,129 --> 00:11:18,129
I don't like it, Cole. Why is she in such a hurry?

92
00:11:18,129 --> 00:11:20,129
We should follow her.

93
00:11:20,129 --> 00:11:22,129
I didn't have any information.

94
00:11:22,129 --> 00:11:26,129
Look, the last time I saw this story was a month ago.

95
00:11:26,129 --> 00:11:30,129
If I read you the first five chapters of a book a month ago and then closed it,

96
00:11:30,129 --> 00:11:33,129
and then a month later I was like, oh, hey, here's the next chapter,

97
00:11:33,129 --> 00:11:36,129
you're going to be like, what are you talking about? What are we doing?

98
00:11:36,129 --> 00:11:42,029
Think of all the other pieces of media you've consumed in the last month.

99
00:11:42,029 --> 00:11:51,440
Ballard is definitely up to something.

100
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:56,129
I don't even know what the specials were at the restaurant I went to last night.

101
00:11:56,129 --> 00:12:02,950
And that happened last night. That was last night.

102
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:11,820
And damn, did they sound good, too.

103
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:22,720
One of them had, it was a pinot sauce, white wine with some kind of fish.

104
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,720
It was a wild-caught fish, too, and I almost bought it.

105
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,720
But I don't know what it was.

106
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:43,080
You know, I wish there was a thing you could do at restaurants,

107
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:46,080
because they give you the menu, right?

108
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,080
Waitress comes over, waiter comes over.

109
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:50,080
Oh, here's your menu. Please take a look at it.

110
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:54,080
And then they come back. Oh, by the way, here are the specials.

111
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:57,080
No, I don't want to hear the specials. Put the specials on the menu.

112
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:00,080
I can't remember the shit that you're telling me.

113
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:04,080
You list off like nine different items and like ten different side dishes.

114
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:07,080
It's like, put it on the fucking menu.

115
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:16,309
I take cover at the door. I don't want to break in here just yet.

116
00:13:16,309 --> 00:13:21,580
Enter the cafe without being seen.

117
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:25,590
I can't go through, don't go through the door?

118
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:36,110
Why would it tell me to go to the door?

119
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:41,570
What? Wrong door.

120
00:13:45,429 --> 00:13:48,429
Look, we're in a restaurant right now. I can't remember the specials.

121
00:13:48,429 --> 00:13:51,990
They were reading specials as I was going up to the door.

122
00:13:51,990 --> 00:14:21,840
This guy's going to see me come. That's a newspaper.

123
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:34,190
Newspaper. That's a newspaper.

124
00:14:42,019 --> 00:14:45,519
You still know people out here, don't you?

125
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:52,500
Then make some calls.

126
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,500
Let me be very clear about this.

127
00:14:54,500 --> 00:15:00,100
You get this done or I'm...

128
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:03,100
Wilson's Hotel. Mr. Mark Bishop,

129
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:06,100
that son of a bitch, lives in apartment 803.

130
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:08,789
Got it.

131
00:15:08,789 --> 00:15:11,350
Thanks for the info.

132
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:14,809
Sure, I got the film.

133
00:15:14,809 --> 00:15:16,980
I got the film.

134
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:22,549
All right, I need to find the film.

135
00:15:22,549 --> 00:15:39,620
This is reading the newspaper very close.

136
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:42,750
That would be really embarrassing.

137
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:45,750
So what's the story? I'm guessing she didn't stop to like refreshments.

138
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:49,750
She made a call. Sounds like Mark Bishop has a heap of trouble headed his way.

139
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:53,750
I've got his address. Wilson's Hotel, Apartment 803.

140
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,750
Oh, shit. You better step on it.

141
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:58,750
If he's got any sense, he'll be as far away from home as possible.

142
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:03,750
If he had any sense, he wouldn't have tried bumping off Guy McAfee's wife in the first place.

143
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:05,750
Or he'd have done the job properly.

144
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:07,750
McAfee will break a fella's legs just for looking at him.

145
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:09,750
You know what I want? Back on the restaurant bullshit again.

146
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:11,750
What did you make of the kid?

147
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:13,750
Do you believe her story?

148
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:16,750
I think she was dumped out of her tiny mind and given the casting couch.

149
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:19,750
That fucking bitch Ballard sold her out.

150
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:27,559
Okay, so if Ballard was doing someone a favor, why did they try to kill her?

151
00:16:27,559 --> 00:16:29,559
What I want in a rescue front?

152
00:16:29,559 --> 00:16:35,440
Take it easy, Phelps. I'd rather get there in one piece.

153
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,440
I think I can fix this.

154
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:41,090
All units in the vicinity in corridor 15, front.

155
00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:51,580
Advice?

156
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:54,580
Get to the car before someone gets hurt.

157
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:56,580
You got any advice?

158
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:58,580
Give me another car.

159
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:01,080
Do we need to have that car?

160
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:09,039
Come here.

161
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:12,039
I don't want to go too far away. It'll fail the mission.

162
00:17:12,039 --> 00:17:14,789
I think I have to be in that car.

163
00:17:14,789 --> 00:17:20,849
I'm sorry, sir. Police officer. I need your car.

164
00:17:20,849 --> 00:17:28,779
What? I think I have to be in that car, don't I?

165
00:17:28,779 --> 00:17:31,410
Will he get in this?

166
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:34,480
I might have to dislodge this car.

167
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,359
Yeah, okay.

168
00:17:40,519 --> 00:17:49,589
I can't even get up there.

169
00:17:49,589 --> 00:18:01,150
How did I do this? I just fell off the edge.

170
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:05,670
I hope I don't need this guy.

171
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:08,670
Just fall off the edge again and dislodge the car.

172
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:11,670
I still have the marker.

173
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:18,390
Delete your save.

174
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:28,009
Is he running right now after the car?

175
00:18:28,009 --> 00:18:37,490
Can you imagine a cop taking your car to commandeer it to drive into their car that is stuck?

176
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:50,009
That would be pretty weird.

177
00:18:50,009 --> 00:18:54,910
You're a loose cannon, Jeremy. You're off to Cates.

178
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:57,660
They need somebody like me.

179
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:03,890
I might not do it well, but I get it done.

180
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:08,660
Except for that. That was really well done.

181
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:11,480
Did he say turn right?

182
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:21,779
Do I think he's in the car with me?

183
00:19:21,779 --> 00:19:30,529
He got up. Bishop's apartment.

184
00:19:30,529 --> 00:19:35,529
I'm Detective Phelps. We received a call about a domestic disturbance in Apartment 803.

185
00:19:35,529 --> 00:19:38,529
He gets the option to do good cop, bad cop work.

186
00:19:38,529 --> 00:19:41,529
Take the elevator and then left down the corridor. It's the last door on the right.

187
00:19:41,529 --> 00:19:43,529
Officer, that was a lie.

188
00:19:43,529 --> 00:19:45,529
Oh, shit. Yeah, it was.

189
00:19:45,529 --> 00:19:59,019
Sounds like we're about to make it a hat trick of hysterical female witnesses.

190
00:19:59,019 --> 00:20:01,460
Take the elevator where? He didn't say which floor.

191
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:04,460
There's probably only five, six floors apparently.

192
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:06,460
He said last door on the right.

193
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:10,740
There it is.

194
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:12,740
No, that's not correct.

195
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:19,019
Where's 803?

196
00:20:19,019 --> 00:20:22,019
He said on the right. Did he say take a left? I don't know.

197
00:20:22,019 --> 00:20:27,690
Hello? Did he say take a left first?

198
00:20:39,599 --> 00:20:41,599
No, this place was torn apart.

199
00:20:53,599 --> 00:20:55,599
Didn't you see her?

200
00:20:55,599 --> 00:20:57,599
No, no, that was somebody else.

201
00:20:57,599 --> 00:21:01,619
That was somebody else.

202
00:21:01,619 --> 00:21:03,619
Okay, so we got some stuff to look at.

203
00:21:03,619 --> 00:21:07,440
There's a vase.

204
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:17,519
Is it the Bible?

205
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:19,519
I don't think this is going to help us.

206
00:21:19,519 --> 00:21:22,700
I don't know. God can't help us now, apparently.

207
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:34,650
What?

208
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:36,650
It's the Bible.

209
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:39,650
What do you mean, the Bible? It's the Bible.

210
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:41,650
It doesn't appear to be connected.

211
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:46,549
It's what? It's a Bible?

212
00:21:46,549 --> 00:21:57,559
Presented to Mark.

213
00:21:57,559 --> 00:22:01,779
Okay.

214
00:22:01,779 --> 00:22:07,480
What's this? A fight game?

215
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:14,390
Ooh, five dollars.

216
00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:16,390
I'll take it.

217
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:18,390
Optimistic, Cole.

218
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:21,849
It's got some nice weight to it.

219
00:22:21,849 --> 00:22:29,339
I don't think so.

220
00:22:29,339 --> 00:22:33,099
Put it down.

221
00:22:33,099 --> 00:22:35,099
Twenty-five dollar bounty for stealing.

222
00:22:35,099 --> 00:22:39,829
Apparently it's rock star week on this channel.

223
00:22:39,829 --> 00:22:43,829
But to be fair, they do make some of the best games.

224
00:22:43,829 --> 00:22:47,269
Old movie set.

225
00:22:47,269 --> 00:22:54,890
Anything on it?

226
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:56,890
There's a bunch of stuff here.

227
00:22:56,890 --> 00:22:58,890
Great wall of Babylon.

228
00:22:58,890 --> 00:23:00,890
A replica of a replica.

229
00:23:00,890 --> 00:23:04,730
Movie set replica.

230
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:07,990
Of a replica.

231
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:11,059
But this is not made by a rock star.

232
00:23:11,059 --> 00:23:13,059
I don't think this is anything.

233
00:23:13,059 --> 00:23:15,059
But they pressed accept on it.

234
00:23:15,059 --> 00:23:17,369
You know what I mean?

235
00:23:17,369 --> 00:23:19,369
They opened the email with the file in it for the EXE.

236
00:23:19,369 --> 00:23:28,579
You know what I mean?

237
00:23:28,579 --> 00:23:30,579
I don't think there's anything else in here.

238
00:23:30,579 --> 00:23:37,180
What about this clock?

239
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:46,259
This painting.

240
00:23:46,259 --> 00:23:54,180
Kitchen. Secret room.

241
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:56,180
A couple of melee weapons.

242
00:23:56,180 --> 00:24:06,980
I don't think I need these.

243
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:08,980
Nothing else?

244
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:10,980
Just like coffee cups and shit.

245
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:16,250
The salad fork is going to blow this gate wide open.

246
00:24:24,059 --> 00:24:26,059
What is going on?

247
00:24:26,059 --> 00:24:31,690
What is happening in the chat room?

248
00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:33,690
There was just like an unleashing of a Jupiter storm.

249
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:39,049
I need to get like the...

250
00:24:44,410 --> 00:24:47,480
Mermaid in the background.

251
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:50,039
Silver screen.

252
00:24:50,039 --> 00:24:52,039
What are these men in the picture?

253
00:24:52,039 --> 00:24:54,859
My husband, Mark.

254
00:24:54,859 --> 00:24:56,859
And Marlin Hopgood.

255
00:24:56,859 --> 00:24:58,859
They work together on occasion.

256
00:24:58,859 --> 00:25:01,099
That's Hopgood's shop.

257
00:25:01,099 --> 00:25:03,099
Marlin Hopgood.

258
00:25:03,099 --> 00:25:06,359
That's a new character.

259
00:25:06,359 --> 00:25:14,599
There's a dog.

260
00:25:14,599 --> 00:25:16,599
Another time and place.

261
00:25:16,599 --> 00:25:26,970
I'm not talking yet.

262
00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:31,619
Nothing?

263
00:25:31,619 --> 00:25:38,730
Balcony?

264
00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:40,730
Okay.

265
00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:42,730
Anything else?

266
00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:52,250
Alright.

267
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:57,559
Is there broken glass on the door?

268
00:25:57,559 --> 00:26:01,210
This door is like broken.

269
00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:03,210
This door is all fucked up.

270
00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:05,210
Can I close the door and look at it?

271
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:16,789
I can't close this door.

272
00:26:16,789 --> 00:26:18,789
Until I get a better look at it.

273
00:26:18,789 --> 00:26:20,789
Do a cool trick off the balcony.

274
00:26:20,789 --> 00:26:29,109
I can't.

275
00:26:29,109 --> 00:26:31,799
Apparently I'm missing something else.

276
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:33,799
That, which I don't know.

277
00:26:33,799 --> 00:26:35,799
Is the clock that I was talking about before I told you.

278
00:26:35,799 --> 00:26:42,630
Nope.

279
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:44,630
What were they looking for?

280
00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:50,140
Have you talked to the lady?

281
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:52,140
I've not talked to the lady, but don't...

282
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:54,140
Isn't there another musical cue when you find all the clues?

283
00:26:54,140 --> 00:27:03,990
Can I offer you an egg in these trying times?

284
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:05,990
What are you guys doing?

285
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:13,529
Oh! That was a big gotcha moment.

286
00:27:13,529 --> 00:27:18,569
There's a check here.

287
00:27:18,569 --> 00:27:20,569
$20,000.

288
00:27:20,569 --> 00:27:22,569
$20,000.

289
00:27:22,569 --> 00:27:25,190
Two...

290
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:27,190
That's another language. I can't read it because it's cursive.

291
00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:29,880
Lupra...

292
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:32,119
Allo rule.

293
00:27:32,119 --> 00:27:40,420
Got it.

294
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:44,579
Hey! Can I ask you some questions?

295
00:27:44,579 --> 00:27:47,779
What's up?

296
00:27:47,779 --> 00:27:49,779
What about that check on the ground?

297
00:27:49,779 --> 00:27:51,779
Who are you paying?

298
00:27:51,779 --> 00:27:55,240
Do you know the name?

299
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,240
June Ballard is married to Guy McCaffey.

300
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:00,119
Have you heard of her?

301
00:28:00,119 --> 00:28:02,119
That slut.

302
00:28:02,119 --> 00:28:04,119
I've been flattering my husband for days.

303
00:28:04,119 --> 00:28:08,119
Mrs. McCaffey alleges that your husband tried to kill her and her friend last night.

304
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:10,119
I think you should tell us what you know.

305
00:28:10,119 --> 00:28:12,619
My husband's a movie producer.

306
00:28:12,619 --> 00:28:14,619
This has something to do with his new picture.

307
00:28:14,619 --> 00:28:16,619
He doesn't include me in his business.

308
00:28:16,619 --> 00:28:18,619
Let me look at the notebook.

309
00:28:18,619 --> 00:28:21,180
What about...

310
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:23,480
The letter from your mother.

311
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,480
She wants you to come home.

312
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,480
Who wrote this check?

313
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:55,880
I did.

314
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:57,880
Aye, aye, aye.

315
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,880
Aye, aye, aye.

316
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,880
Can we get on with this, please?

317
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:05,079
I'm an officer of the law, ma'am.

318
00:29:05,079 --> 00:29:16,920
Mmm...

319
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:19,349
I don't believe it.

320
00:29:19,349 --> 00:29:21,349
June Ballard said she had a deal to be in his new picture.

321
00:29:21,349 --> 00:29:23,349
Mark repeatedly told her no.

322
00:29:23,349 --> 00:29:25,660
He had Joan Leslie lined up for the role.

323
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:27,660
That's how he got the finance.

324
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:29,660
June made all kinds of threats.

325
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:31,660
She was very rude to me.

326
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:33,660
You know June Ballard?

327
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:35,660
We were both on the same picture a few years back.

328
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:38,019
That's how I am.

329
00:29:38,019 --> 00:29:40,019
Whose dead eye?

330
00:29:40,019 --> 00:29:43,670
Do you know

331
00:29:43,670 --> 00:29:45,670
where Bishop is?

332
00:29:45,670 --> 00:29:47,670
Where can we find your husband, ma'am?

333
00:29:47,670 --> 00:29:49,670
He told me he would be on set. That's all I know.

334
00:29:49,670 --> 00:29:56,250
Is it?

335
00:29:56,250 --> 00:29:58,250
If he was practicing in the mirror for this part...

336
00:29:58,250 --> 00:30:03,430
What about this underwear? Do you know what this is?

337
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:09,960
Either we find him, or McAfee's people do, Mrs. Bishop.

338
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,960
If you care for him,

339
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,960
you should make sure that we find him first.

340
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:17,220
I do care for him.

341
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:19,220
But I don't really know

342
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:21,220
where he'd go if he were in trouble.

343
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:23,460
Hopgood might know.

344
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:27,109
Okay, the trace address of Prop Store.

345
00:30:27,109 --> 00:30:29,109
Now who is this check for $20,000 for?

346
00:30:29,109 --> 00:30:31,109
Why is your husband paying Lorna Hopgood

347
00:30:31,109 --> 00:30:33,109
$20,000?

348
00:30:33,109 --> 00:30:35,109
Lorna?

349
00:30:35,109 --> 00:30:37,539
Marlin's ex-wife?

350
00:30:37,539 --> 00:30:42,009
Are you sure?

351
00:30:42,009 --> 00:30:53,579
Yeah.

352
00:30:53,579 --> 00:30:55,579
We got her.

353
00:30:55,579 --> 00:30:57,579
I have the check.

354
00:30:57,579 --> 00:30:59,579
But I don't accuse.

355
00:30:59,579 --> 00:31:01,579
I mean, I do have the check.

356
00:31:01,579 --> 00:31:04,650
But what if she didn't

357
00:31:04,650 --> 00:31:09,319
write it, though?

358
00:31:09,319 --> 00:31:11,319
You're lying, Mrs. Bishop.

359
00:31:11,319 --> 00:31:13,319
It's some kind of payoff. You know exactly

360
00:31:13,319 --> 00:31:15,319
what the money is for and who it's getting paid to.

361
00:31:15,319 --> 00:31:17,799
Do I?

362
00:31:17,799 --> 00:31:19,799
Would you like to prove that, detective?

363
00:31:19,799 --> 00:31:21,799
Yeah.

364
00:31:21,799 --> 00:31:24,420
I got the check right here.

365
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:26,420
$20,000 made out to

366
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:29,690
Lorna

367
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:31,690
Hopgood on the account of Mark Bishop.

368
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:39,750
I got it.

369
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:41,750
Your husband looks like he's being blackmailed.

370
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:43,750
They obviously have something on him. If he's prepared to kill to cover it up,

371
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:45,750
why is the payment going to Hopgood

372
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:47,930
and not McAfee?

373
00:31:47,930 --> 00:31:49,930
Lorna works at a check cashing place in

374
00:31:49,930 --> 00:31:51,930
Hollywood. You need to ask

375
00:31:51,930 --> 00:31:53,930
Hopgood why he needs that much money in

376
00:31:53,930 --> 00:31:56,740
cash.

377
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:58,740
Your husband is in trouble. It could go easier

378
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:00,740
for him if you were more helpful, Mrs. Bishop.

379
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:03,369
Perfect score!

380
00:32:03,369 --> 00:32:05,369
You're a big boy, detective, and so are you.

381
00:32:05,369 --> 00:32:07,369
This is Hollywood.

382
00:32:07,369 --> 00:32:09,369
There's always a deal to be done.

383
00:32:09,369 --> 00:32:12,059
By the way, your necklace

384
00:32:12,059 --> 00:32:14,059
is out of focus. Just want to make sure, you know,

385
00:32:14,059 --> 00:32:16,059
take care of that.

386
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:19,059
Hello, I need to use the telephone.

387
00:32:19,059 --> 00:32:22,900
Operator, give me R&I.

388
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:27,059
Putting you through now.

389
00:32:27,059 --> 00:32:31,099
Phelps, batch 1247.

390
00:32:31,099 --> 00:32:33,099
Detective?

391
00:32:33,099 --> 00:32:35,099
I need a location on a silver screen prop store.

392
00:32:35,099 --> 00:32:38,039
Just a moment.

393
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:41,049
Smartest streamer on Twitch.

394
00:32:41,049 --> 00:32:43,799
Thanks, man.

395
00:32:43,799 --> 00:32:50,390
Investigate silver screen props.

396
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:54,359
Get out of the way.

397
00:32:54,359 --> 00:33:01,400
Use your own phone. Get out of my house.

398
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:04,920
Open up your cell phone, man.

399
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,920
I know this takes place.

400
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,920
Small complaint about the game.

401
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,920
I know this takes place in the 40s, but

402
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,920
fucking it's modern times now, man.

403
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,920
Just let them have a phone or something.

404
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,920
Let them have a pawnpilot with GPS and everything.

405
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:18,920
It's really annoying.

406
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:28,660
This game released in like 2007.

407
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:30,660
I know it's like 1937 or

408
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:32,660
1942 or whatever it is, but

409
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:35,539
no gamer wants to play like this.

410
00:33:35,539 --> 00:33:37,539
Give me a fucking pawnpilot.

411
00:33:37,539 --> 00:33:42,920
Mrs. Bishop knows more than she's letting on.

412
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,920
She doesn't seem to realize how much trouble

413
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,920
her husband is in.

414
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,920
The LAPD are the least of their worries right now.

415
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,920
You think she'd have gotten the hint that

416
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,920
the hatchet man redecorated her apartment?

417
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,920
Maybe she's just loyal.

418
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,920
No, they didn't have hint.

419
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,920
Small complaint about the game.

420
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,920
I know it's like 1940, but

421
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,920
where the fuck is the...

422
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,920
There's a handbrake on every car now.

423
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,920
Just put a handbrake in the game.

424
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:21,960
It's really irritating.

425
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,960
There is a handbrake.

426
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:25,960
I just pulled it.

427
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:42,730
It's like music.

428
00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:45,289
Small complaint about the game.

429
00:34:45,289 --> 00:34:47,659
Fucking seriously.

430
00:34:47,659 --> 00:34:49,659
It's like 2007, 2008.

431
00:34:49,659 --> 00:34:51,659
They claimed this boring, dumb shit music.

432
00:34:51,659 --> 00:34:53,659
It's fucking irritating.

433
00:34:53,659 --> 00:34:55,659
It's like Limp Bizkit.

434
00:34:55,659 --> 00:34:57,659
They put like current music on it.

435
00:34:57,659 --> 00:34:59,659
It's fucking annoying.

436
00:34:59,659 --> 00:35:02,219
Watch what you're doing!

437
00:35:02,219 --> 00:35:12,199
Why can't I put my own custom playlist?

438
00:35:12,199 --> 00:35:23,590
They can

439
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:25,590
update the rosters on Madden and

440
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:27,590
MLB the show and stuff.

441
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:29,590
Why can't they update the playlists and the current radio stations?

442
00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:31,590
Fucking annoying.

443
00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:33,769
It's gonna get points off the game.

444
00:35:33,769 --> 00:35:35,769
For real though, I just wanna make sure you guys are aware of that.

445
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:46,329
End this.

446
00:35:46,329 --> 00:35:48,329
Someone's in that shoot of armor!

447
00:36:02,469 --> 00:36:04,469
No, I'm not gonna do the sound.

448
00:36:04,469 --> 00:36:10,940
The bare default sound.

449
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:12,940
Sorry.

450
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:16,780
Plus, a car just made it

451
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:18,780
driving by, so I didn't even have to do it.

452
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:34,519
Shoot the armor before it gets you.

453
00:36:34,519 --> 00:36:37,659
This is here. Soundstage.

454
00:36:41,659 --> 00:36:46,139
Let's have a look around.

455
00:36:46,139 --> 00:36:51,769
Ooh,

456
00:36:51,769 --> 00:36:53,769
would you look at that?

457
00:36:53,769 --> 00:36:57,159
Ah, I found one of these

458
00:36:57,159 --> 00:36:59,159
at the crime scene.

459
00:36:59,159 --> 00:37:06,760
Didn't I?

460
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,760
Looks eerily familiar.

461
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:14,260
Is there a reason why I haven't said anything about that yet?

462
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:20,710
Why won't I

463
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:24,489
say anything about this?

464
00:37:24,489 --> 00:37:26,489
Do I have to find a certain thing on it?

465
00:37:26,489 --> 00:37:28,489
Because he's not like, oh,

466
00:37:28,489 --> 00:37:42,250
there's a guy in there.

467
00:37:42,250 --> 00:37:48,260
Ah.

468
00:37:58,969 --> 00:38:00,969
This guy's got a peep den.

469
00:38:00,969 --> 00:38:03,269
And there's drugs here too.

470
00:38:03,269 --> 00:38:06,460
So this guy,

471
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:08,460
this guy is a bad man.

472
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:14,889
Well, gotcha.

473
00:38:14,889 --> 00:38:18,599
See, now you're fucked.

474
00:38:18,599 --> 00:38:39,059
Something else back here?

475
00:38:39,059 --> 00:38:44,380
No?

476
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:46,380
Hold on.

477
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:48,380
They're everywhere. I already know that.

478
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:53,429
Yeah, I got a little soundstage.

479
00:38:53,429 --> 00:38:55,429
You're gonna rot.

480
00:38:55,429 --> 00:39:01,000
Can't be that way, Phelps.

481
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
You couldn't fit a rat through there.

482
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:09,190
It's right here.

483
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:11,190
There's a secret button on the wall.

484
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:16,099
How do I turn the light off here?

485
00:39:16,099 --> 00:39:18,099
Where's the book that I have to pull out for the

486
00:39:18,099 --> 00:39:26,550
wall to collapse?

487
00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:41,340
It's right back here. Toilet paper roll?

488
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:43,340
Flush the toilet?

489
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:52,409
Wait, hold on.

490
00:39:52,409 --> 00:39:56,179
Not everything here is going to be relevant.

491
00:39:56,179 --> 00:40:05,769
Ah.

492
00:40:05,769 --> 00:40:07,769
In the dumpster. Secret dumpster entrance.

493
00:40:07,769 --> 00:40:19,269
No, nevermind.

494
00:40:19,269 --> 00:40:21,829
Do you really have the fucking

495
00:40:21,829 --> 00:40:25,030
ACME Road Runner

496
00:40:25,030 --> 00:40:27,030
set up where, I mean, if that was a cartoon,

497
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:29,030
I'd be able to run through that.

498
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:31,030
And then the guy behind me would chase me and

499
00:40:31,030 --> 00:40:34,619
smash into that.

500
00:40:34,619 --> 00:40:36,619
Well, this is the 40s.

501
00:40:36,619 --> 00:40:38,619
So that was relevant. Those things did work on people back then.

502
00:40:38,619 --> 00:40:41,559
Okay.

503
00:40:41,559 --> 00:40:43,989
So we have a secret camera room.

504
00:40:43,989 --> 00:40:45,989
That's not fucked up at all.

505
00:40:45,989 --> 00:40:47,989
Okay.

506
00:40:47,989 --> 00:40:52,329
What's over here? What's that?

507
00:40:52,329 --> 00:40:59,050
There's the toilet.

508
00:40:59,050 --> 00:41:05,510
Okay, there's all these photos.

509
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:08,579
I wonder if they saw this,

510
00:41:08,579 --> 00:41:10,579
how many budding starlets would still get on the bus

511
00:41:10,579 --> 00:41:12,579
to come to Hollywood.

512
00:41:12,579 --> 00:41:19,480
So, I was going to say, why am I stuck there?

513
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:29,960
Okay.

514
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,960
We've got, oh, this is the

515
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,960
film, I think, right?

516
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:37,289
So we've got a

517
00:41:37,289 --> 00:41:39,289
Jungle Drums.

518
00:41:39,289 --> 00:41:41,289
Eighth and Francisco.

519
00:41:41,289 --> 00:41:43,289
These guys were running like a fucking fucked up

520
00:41:43,289 --> 00:41:45,289
like secret spy.

521
00:41:45,289 --> 00:41:47,460
Yeah.

522
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:50,789
What are you going to do with this?

523
00:41:50,789 --> 00:41:55,079
Phelps, put on gloves, man.

524
00:41:55,079 --> 00:42:00,389
You're tainting the scene.

525
00:42:00,389 --> 00:42:04,550
Let's take a look at this one. These, like, creepy fucks

526
00:42:04,550 --> 00:42:06,550
just filming people behind the wall.

527
00:42:06,550 --> 00:42:11,030
Hmm.

528
00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:17,880
Interesting.

529
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:27,670
I don't need any butterscotch.

530
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:31,130
Okay.

531
00:42:31,130 --> 00:42:38,039
This is just somebody sat back here.

532
00:42:38,039 --> 00:42:42,579
So, somebody had to,

533
00:42:42,579 --> 00:42:44,579
it was a two-man

534
00:42:44,579 --> 00:42:46,579
thing here. Cause somebody had to upright the camera.

535
00:42:46,579 --> 00:42:48,579
They're both, and they're both guilty.

536
00:42:48,579 --> 00:42:53,260
Is there anything else that I missed in here?

537
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:56,329
Sure, I didn't.

538
00:42:56,329 --> 00:42:58,760
There's that. I got that.

539
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:01,880
I got that.

540
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:06,809
Nothing else? That's it.

541
00:43:06,809 --> 00:43:12,250
But, there is a bunch of this,

542
00:43:12,250 --> 00:43:15,190
this thing. What about back here?

543
00:43:15,190 --> 00:43:19,349
Painting these.

544
00:43:19,349 --> 00:43:21,909
All right. Well, this is very clearly.

545
00:43:21,909 --> 00:43:23,909
Okay.

546
00:43:23,909 --> 00:43:25,909
That's the one.

547
00:43:25,909 --> 00:43:27,909
This is where you sprang from.

548
00:43:27,909 --> 00:43:30,090
Here are the molds.

549
00:43:30,090 --> 00:43:35,269
Should I take one of these?

550
00:43:35,269 --> 00:43:42,889
I guess that, yeah, that's just, they're just making them.

551
00:43:42,889 --> 00:43:46,980
This game, well, this game came out

552
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:48,980
in 1940, cause that's when it takes place.

553
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:59,860
Flood streets,

554
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:01,860
cops chase, war, surplus, contraband.

555
00:44:03,860 --> 00:44:07,260
Let's take a look.

556
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:25,260
You want to be a doctor, and a dope peddler.

557
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:27,559
Interesting combination, huh?

558
00:44:27,559 --> 00:44:31,019
Do we have a problem,

559
00:44:31,019 --> 00:44:33,019
Mr. Cohen?

560
00:44:33,019 --> 00:44:35,510
We might have. Yeah.

561
00:44:35,510 --> 00:44:37,510
Selling your dope to my boy Lenny looked like a good move,

562
00:44:37,510 --> 00:44:39,510
but Lenny has been supplying, uh,

563
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:41,510
wholesale, so to speak.

564
00:44:41,510 --> 00:44:43,510
The Bindle Boys in this town

565
00:44:43,510 --> 00:44:45,510
aren't used to the juice without a little of the middle man

566
00:44:45,510 --> 00:44:47,510
taking his cut.

567
00:44:47,510 --> 00:44:50,840
Lenny promised that wouldn't happen, Mr. Cohen.

568
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:53,460
And Lenny works for you.

569
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:55,960
What can I say about Lenny?

570
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:58,329
Let me think. Oh, yeah,

571
00:44:58,329 --> 00:45:00,329
he's a putz, and he's lazy,

572
00:45:00,329 --> 00:45:02,329
and he's greedy, but he's my wife's brother.

573
00:45:02,329 --> 00:45:04,329
What were the specials again? I don't remember.

574
00:45:04,329 --> 00:45:06,329
You have to make a cake with those ingredients, huh?

575
00:45:06,329 --> 00:45:08,820
That was a bad call back.

576
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:10,820
So how was that my problem, Mr. Cohen?

577
00:45:10,820 --> 00:45:13,130
Well, kids, the only way we're going to be able

578
00:45:13,130 --> 00:45:15,130
to make this work is to do some repackaging.

579
00:45:15,130 --> 00:45:17,130
We need to get the dope out of those dinky little cardboard

580
00:45:17,130 --> 00:45:19,130
boxes. So we're putting them in the heads.

581
00:45:19,130 --> 00:45:21,429
Dope in the heads.

582
00:45:21,429 --> 00:45:23,860
Yeah, so reds. Great. We can put it into a big

583
00:45:23,860 --> 00:45:25,860
vat so we can water it down a little bit.

584
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:28,739
Who bore you with the chemistry?

585
00:45:28,739 --> 00:45:30,739
But it doesn't work that way.

586
00:45:30,739 --> 00:45:33,179
You're likely to kill even more people.

587
00:45:33,179 --> 00:45:35,179
Okay. Listen.

588
00:45:35,179 --> 00:45:37,179
We want to buy you out, kid. What did I eat last night?

589
00:45:37,179 --> 00:45:39,179
I'll offer you 50 grand.

590
00:45:39,179 --> 00:45:42,360
Water.

591
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:44,360
There was water in...

592
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:46,360
Hey. Hey! A salt.

593
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:48,360
You don't like my offer? I forget everything else.

594
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:58,539
Where'd the phone come from?

595
00:45:58,539 --> 00:46:00,539
Whose phone is this? I think I want him dead.

596
00:46:00,539 --> 00:46:02,780
Thanks for the

597
00:46:02,780 --> 00:46:04,780
part of the table under the seat

598
00:46:04,780 --> 00:46:12,519
telephone.

599
00:46:12,519 --> 00:46:14,519
The logistics of having a phone at that table back

600
00:46:14,519 --> 00:46:16,519
in 1940.

601
00:46:16,519 --> 00:46:18,519
That cable has to run through the whole restaurant.

602
00:46:18,519 --> 00:46:25,559
People are going to trip over that.

603
00:46:25,559 --> 00:46:32,409
All right. So we got some info here.

604
00:46:32,409 --> 00:46:34,710
There's dope

605
00:46:34,710 --> 00:46:40,409
is involved.

606
00:46:40,409 --> 00:46:42,409
They're like, I'm going to cut one of these open.

607
00:46:42,409 --> 00:46:55,400
Hello? I'm going to cut one of

608
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:57,400
those open. There's going to be dope in there.

609
00:46:57,400 --> 00:46:59,400
Oh, come on. Let's go.

610
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:01,400
Come on, girl.

611
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:06,070
That's a good girl.

612
00:47:06,070 --> 00:47:08,070
I played that other game. I played that other game.

613
00:47:08,070 --> 00:47:13,559
And see? These were all

614
00:47:13,559 --> 00:47:15,559
taken from Red Dead. Didn't I tell you?

615
00:47:15,559 --> 00:47:20,489
Red Dead. Red Dead.

616
00:47:20,489 --> 00:47:22,489
Red Dead.

617
00:47:22,489 --> 00:47:30,409
That's a different game.

618
00:47:30,409 --> 00:47:32,409
I got enough evidence to put this guy away for life.

619
00:47:32,409 --> 00:47:38,940
So don't worry.

620
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:40,940
All right. Skip the dialogue. You're going

621
00:47:40,940 --> 00:47:46,820
away for life.

622
00:47:46,820 --> 00:47:48,820
You ever do any work for Mark Bishop?

623
00:47:48,820 --> 00:47:51,130
Mainly do work for the studios.

624
00:47:51,130 --> 00:47:53,130
RKO, Republic,

625
00:47:53,130 --> 00:47:55,800
Warner Brothers. So yeah.

626
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:58,170
And Bishop is doing work for a studio.

627
00:47:58,170 --> 00:48:00,170
Yes. When did you last see him?

628
00:48:00,170 --> 00:48:02,340
Yeah, I'm doing work for his next picture.

629
00:48:02,340 --> 00:48:05,980
Still pre-production though.

630
00:48:05,980 --> 00:48:08,409
Is it? I haven't seen him around here

631
00:48:08,409 --> 00:48:10,409
in a while. Really?

632
00:48:10,409 --> 00:48:13,219
Hmm. Haven't seen him

633
00:48:13,219 --> 00:48:15,530
around in a while, have you?

634
00:48:15,530 --> 00:48:17,530
This letter from your mother says otherwise.

635
00:48:17,530 --> 00:48:21,050
She's looking for you and she's

636
00:48:21,050 --> 00:48:26,809
worried about you. All right, hold on.

637
00:48:26,809 --> 00:48:28,809
This is the movie set photographer,

638
00:48:28,809 --> 00:48:30,809
photographer, prop store photographer.

639
00:48:30,809 --> 00:48:33,239
When was this taken?

640
00:48:33,239 --> 00:48:41,300
It's got to be like a date somewhere, right?

641
00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:53,079
Film reel. I mean,

642
00:48:53,079 --> 00:48:55,079
like, when was this taken?

643
00:48:55,079 --> 00:48:57,079
The mermaid statue.

644
00:48:59,079 --> 00:49:04,010
How would that prove, like, that date

645
00:49:04,010 --> 00:49:06,010
though? Is there a date on here?

646
00:49:06,010 --> 00:49:16,099
What's the date?

647
00:49:16,099 --> 00:49:18,099
Should I just accuse him and just put up the checkout?

648
00:49:18,099 --> 00:49:20,099
No. I mean, like, he's clearly

649
00:49:20,099 --> 00:49:22,099
in the photo here, but this is from

650
00:49:22,099 --> 00:49:24,539
the mermaid movie.

651
00:49:24,539 --> 00:49:28,309
Do I have any other information

652
00:49:28,309 --> 00:49:36,380
besides that? I mean, this is

653
00:49:36,380 --> 00:49:38,739
ugh.

654
00:49:38,739 --> 00:49:40,739
I don't know the date on here. This could be any time.

655
00:49:40,739 --> 00:49:49,900
Hold on a minute.

656
00:50:22,179 --> 00:50:29,929
Like, none of these mean anything

657
00:50:29,929 --> 00:50:31,929
though. What about, like, the fucking hidden cameras?

658
00:50:31,929 --> 00:50:35,380
Why can't I bring that up?

659
00:50:35,380 --> 00:50:37,690
I have, like, a check

660
00:50:37,690 --> 00:50:39,690
and, like, a photo of these two.

661
00:50:39,690 --> 00:50:46,219
How would that determine where...

662
00:50:46,219 --> 00:50:48,219
Do you know where he is? I have a photo of you

663
00:50:48,219 --> 00:50:55,380
too. And what about the drugs?

664
00:50:55,380 --> 00:50:57,380
Like, I can't be like, hey, why do you have the...

665
00:50:57,380 --> 00:50:59,380
I can't just be like, what is this?

666
00:51:10,340 --> 00:51:12,340
Like, the empty... Yeah, but that's not the

667
00:51:12,340 --> 00:51:14,340
question though. The question was like, do you know where he is?

668
00:51:14,340 --> 00:51:16,710
Why isn't the first question

669
00:51:16,710 --> 00:51:18,710
like, hey, what's with the drugs and cameras?

670
00:51:52,809 --> 00:51:54,809
How would I know?

671
00:51:54,809 --> 00:51:56,809
How would I be able to get the information of

672
00:51:56,809 --> 00:51:58,809
where he is?

673
00:51:58,809 --> 00:52:00,809
Where is he?

674
00:52:00,809 --> 00:52:02,809
I have a picture of them two on a

675
00:52:02,809 --> 00:52:04,809
set, but when was that taken?

676
00:52:18,809 --> 00:52:21,239
So is this the reason why I can't bring up

677
00:52:21,239 --> 00:52:23,239
all the other stuff?

678
00:52:27,739 --> 00:52:29,739
Are you thinking too hard about it?

679
00:52:29,739 --> 00:52:31,739
Was it really just as simple as

680
00:52:31,739 --> 00:52:33,739
here's a photo of you two?

681
00:52:33,739 --> 00:52:35,739
Like, that's it.

682
00:52:57,739 --> 00:52:59,739
It's the simplest answer.

683
00:53:27,980 --> 00:53:29,980
He will be bringing Mark Bishop into custody.

684
00:53:29,980 --> 00:53:32,150
At least he's polite.

685
00:53:32,150 --> 00:53:34,150
Kinda dumb.

686
00:53:34,150 --> 00:53:36,150
But polite.

687
00:53:40,150 --> 00:53:42,150
So it's just all red herrings and then one item is

688
00:53:42,150 --> 00:53:44,150
correct or something? Is that how this game works?

689
00:53:46,150 --> 00:53:48,150
Just pick up a bunch of evidence and then there's one

690
00:53:48,150 --> 00:53:50,150
question. Please press this button on this one

691
00:53:50,150 --> 00:53:52,150
thing.

692
00:53:59,989 --> 00:54:10,940
Why?

693
00:54:10,940 --> 00:54:12,940
Why would you start shooting?

694
00:54:12,940 --> 00:54:19,059
Okay.

695
00:54:19,059 --> 00:54:21,059
That came out of nowhere.

696
00:54:21,059 --> 00:54:23,059
I didn't do anything.

697
00:54:23,059 --> 00:54:26,199
Should I shoot?

698
00:54:33,449 --> 00:54:36,650
Am I...am I was an accident here?

699
00:54:38,650 --> 00:54:44,150
Alright, shoot him.

700
00:54:44,150 --> 00:54:46,650
There are two cars here.

701
00:54:51,340 --> 00:54:53,340
Okay.

702
00:54:55,340 --> 00:54:57,340
It worked, but...

703
00:54:57,340 --> 00:55:03,860
That guy is getting

704
00:55:03,860 --> 00:55:06,039
stepped on.

705
00:55:06,039 --> 00:55:08,539
Why would he get out of the car?

706
00:55:19,349 --> 00:55:21,349
Alright, I did it.

707
00:55:25,349 --> 00:55:27,349
Let's go to the set.

708
00:55:35,349 --> 00:55:37,349
Kathy really means business.

709
00:55:37,349 --> 00:55:39,349
Seems like we're the only ones who want Bishop alive.

710
00:55:39,349 --> 00:55:41,349
I have a good mind just to let him go work

711
00:55:41,349 --> 00:55:43,349
on the son of a bitch.

712
00:55:43,349 --> 00:55:45,349
I'm about done putting my life on the line to protect

713
00:55:45,349 --> 00:55:47,349
some child molester.

714
00:55:47,349 --> 00:55:49,349
That's our job, unfortunately.

715
00:55:49,349 --> 00:55:51,349
They don't get to dole out the justice.

716
00:55:51,349 --> 00:56:04,340
Well, alright.

717
00:56:04,340 --> 00:56:07,860
So I think I'm understanding.

718
00:56:07,860 --> 00:56:09,860
Go investigate

719
00:56:09,860 --> 00:56:11,860
guy's sick fucking

720
00:56:11,860 --> 00:56:15,829
perverted place.

721
00:56:15,829 --> 00:56:17,829
Do you have a photograph of me and him?

722
00:56:17,829 --> 00:56:19,829
Yes.

723
00:56:19,829 --> 00:56:50,739
Okay, that's it. Bye.

724
00:56:50,739 --> 00:56:52,739
You need evidence.

725
00:56:52,739 --> 00:56:54,739
Yeah, but that whole fucking house was an

726
00:56:54,739 --> 00:56:56,739
giant ball of evidence.

727
00:56:56,739 --> 00:57:00,900
That guy was standing essentially

728
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:02,900
at the scene of the murder.

729
00:57:02,900 --> 00:57:04,900
With blood all over his body.

730
00:57:04,900 --> 00:57:06,900
And three screaming people.

731
00:57:06,900 --> 00:57:08,900
Dead and screaming, dying.

732
00:57:08,900 --> 00:57:10,900
Mark Bishop, stop! LAPD!

733
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:27,670
He's not very fast, either.

734
00:57:27,670 --> 00:57:35,739
We're trying to help you, Bishop.

735
00:57:35,739 --> 00:57:41,480
Thank you.

736
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:46,730
He's a mad hatter.

737
00:57:46,730 --> 00:57:48,730
He takes an uphill.

738
00:57:48,730 --> 00:57:50,730
That was the mistake, you're right.

739
00:57:50,730 --> 00:57:58,599
It's us or McAfee's boys.

740
00:57:58,599 --> 00:58:02,699
Your choice.

741
00:58:02,699 --> 00:58:06,280
You didn't do anything. Wait, come here.

742
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:08,280
I have a photograph I want to show you.

743
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:21,190
Hey.

744
00:58:21,190 --> 00:58:25,030
Bishop, that's enough.

745
00:58:25,030 --> 00:58:27,030
I have a letter from your mother. She's worried sick.

746
00:58:27,030 --> 00:58:36,059
Yeah, that's right. Now you stay

747
00:58:36,059 --> 00:58:38,059
right there. And what's this check made

748
00:58:38,059 --> 00:58:40,059
out to you, sir?

749
00:58:40,059 --> 00:58:56,940
Shit!

750
00:58:56,940 --> 00:58:58,940
Mark Bishop, stop! LAPD!

751
00:58:58,940 --> 00:59:00,940
I didn't know that was possible.

752
00:59:00,940 --> 00:59:02,940
I thought it was just a run of...

753
00:59:02,940 --> 00:59:04,940
I didn't know it was possible.

754
00:59:04,940 --> 00:59:14,539
Plus, I'm reading chat

755
00:59:14,539 --> 00:59:16,539
during this run behind the guy.

756
00:59:16,539 --> 00:59:21,269
Sorry.

757
00:59:21,269 --> 00:59:24,409
We're trying to help you, Bishop.

758
00:59:24,409 --> 00:59:41,690
Thank you.

759
00:59:41,690 --> 00:59:43,690
It's us or McAfee's boys.

760
00:59:43,690 --> 00:59:49,320
Your choice.

761
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:55,210
We both did the same thing.

762
00:59:55,210 --> 00:59:57,210
We both learned how to jump from the same

763
00:59:57,210 --> 01:00:02,389
sensei, apparently.

764
01:00:02,389 --> 01:00:04,389
Move another inch and you're dead.

765
01:00:04,389 --> 01:00:06,389
Dead? Bishop, that's enough.

766
01:00:06,389 --> 01:00:09,849
Bishop, you're under

767
01:00:09,849 --> 01:00:11,849
arrest for the attempted murder of June Ballard

768
01:00:11,849 --> 01:00:13,849
and the rape and attempted murder

769
01:00:13,849 --> 01:00:16,539
of Jessica Hamilton.

770
01:00:16,539 --> 01:00:18,539
All right, I'll come quietly. Just don't

771
01:00:18,539 --> 01:00:20,780
kill me. If you found

772
01:00:20,780 --> 01:00:22,780
me, then McAfee's goons will too.

773
01:00:22,780 --> 01:00:25,659
We need to get out of here.

774
01:00:25,659 --> 01:00:30,260
You stay close. Any tricks

775
01:00:30,260 --> 01:00:32,260
and I'll save McAfee's boys the trouble.

776
01:00:32,260 --> 01:00:34,260
Follow me. I know another way

777
01:00:34,260 --> 01:00:36,260
to get out of this place.

778
01:00:36,260 --> 01:00:43,690
I was going to make an elaborate

779
01:00:43,690 --> 01:00:45,690
place. Christ detective,

780
01:00:45,690 --> 01:00:47,690
they're trying to kill me.

781
01:00:47,690 --> 01:00:49,690
How to stop the McAfee boys. Last chance to back

782
01:00:49,690 --> 01:00:51,690
the hell down. Install a program that

783
01:00:51,690 --> 01:00:53,989
uses the internet.

784
01:00:53,989 --> 01:00:55,989
It'll break everything.

785
01:00:55,989 --> 01:01:00,789
They won't know what to do.

786
01:01:00,789 --> 01:01:05,980
This way. R2, I forgot.

787
01:01:05,980 --> 01:01:07,980
McAfee doesn't make the rules.

788
01:01:07,980 --> 01:01:09,980
You hear me?

789
01:01:09,980 --> 01:01:11,980
Kill them for god's sake.

790
01:01:11,980 --> 01:01:15,110
I don't want to die.

791
01:01:15,110 --> 01:01:17,110
Pop it up.

792
01:01:17,110 --> 01:01:20,760
Shoot the barrels to the stroll of the wall.

793
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:24,760
Fire away.

794
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:28,760
No, I'm not very good at this.

795
01:01:28,760 --> 01:01:32,659
I'm not very good at this.

796
01:01:53,500 --> 01:01:58,300
Am I not hit?

797
01:01:58,300 --> 01:02:00,300
What is going on right now?

798
01:02:00,300 --> 01:02:05,099
What the fuck is happening?

799
01:02:05,099 --> 01:02:07,099
Do I need a different weapon?

800
01:02:07,099 --> 01:02:09,099
Do I need an X to pick up weapons?

801
01:02:09,099 --> 01:02:12,170
Am I too far away to shoot

802
01:02:12,170 --> 01:02:18,179
these guys?

803
01:02:18,179 --> 01:02:20,179
Why is it going down?

804
01:02:20,179 --> 01:02:26,840
Okay, honest to god.

805
01:02:30,809 --> 01:02:32,809
Okay, very finally. Now I'm out of

806
01:02:32,809 --> 01:02:36,139
range.

807
01:02:36,139 --> 01:02:44,519
Just curve the bullets.

808
01:02:44,519 --> 01:02:48,230
This should be death.

809
01:02:48,230 --> 01:02:50,730
I pressed

810
01:02:50,730 --> 01:02:52,730
X on it. It didn't do anything.

811
01:02:52,730 --> 01:02:54,730
I saw pick up weapons like three times.

812
01:02:54,730 --> 01:02:59,980
I pressed X.

813
01:02:59,980 --> 01:03:01,980
Okay, now I have it.

814
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:06,920
Weird.

815
01:03:06,920 --> 01:03:08,920
Why would you do that? Get out of there.

816
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:30,420
I'm being a bad teammate.

817
01:03:41,750 --> 01:03:45,340
Where the hell was he before?

818
01:03:45,340 --> 01:03:47,340
Was he waiting for me to kill things before?

819
01:04:00,519 --> 01:04:02,519
All the Red Dead Redemption 2 aiming

820
01:04:02,519 --> 01:04:04,519
hasn't paid off?

821
01:04:04,519 --> 01:04:06,519
I got news for you.

822
01:04:06,519 --> 01:04:08,519
It doesn't matter how much

823
01:04:08,519 --> 01:04:10,519
you train in console aiming.

824
01:04:10,519 --> 01:04:12,519
It either auto-targets

825
01:04:12,519 --> 01:04:14,519
or you have an eye closed.

826
01:04:14,519 --> 01:04:16,519
That's just kind of how it works.

827
01:04:16,519 --> 01:04:23,800
What are you doing?

828
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:48,739
What are you doing? Get off.

829
01:04:51,369 --> 01:05:06,469
Hurry!

830
01:05:06,469 --> 01:05:09,030
Convenient explosive barrels.

831
01:05:09,030 --> 01:05:12,230
Pick up weapons.

832
01:05:12,230 --> 01:05:19,269
Should I pick it up?

833
01:05:19,269 --> 01:05:21,269
I'll try it.

834
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:29,800
That's not the people I should be shooting at.

835
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:32,099
Those are our officers.

836
01:05:32,099 --> 01:05:42,340
Stay in cover.

837
01:05:42,340 --> 01:05:46,699
You guys through the window?

838
01:05:46,699 --> 01:05:53,590
It is just one guy left.

839
01:05:53,590 --> 01:06:03,190
Who is left?

840
01:06:03,190 --> 01:06:05,190
This is what I call a result.

841
01:06:05,190 --> 01:06:07,190
Mark Bishop,

842
01:06:07,190 --> 01:06:09,190
first wild film producer,

843
01:06:09,190 --> 01:06:11,190
an all-around piece of shit,

844
01:06:11,190 --> 01:06:13,190
catches a fast ticket to Quentin

845
01:06:13,190 --> 01:06:15,190
for stach rape and attempted murder.

846
01:06:15,190 --> 01:06:17,190
So he gets to spend the next 15 years

847
01:06:17,190 --> 01:06:19,190
playing...

848
01:06:19,190 --> 01:06:23,190
That is just capital J, Detective Phelps.

849
01:06:23,190 --> 01:06:25,429
You don't have such a reputation.

850
01:06:25,429 --> 01:06:27,429
I'm not going to be able to hold on to you any longer.

851
01:06:27,429 --> 01:06:29,429
You're getting promoted.

852
01:06:29,429 --> 01:06:31,429
Go on, get your new assignment.

853
01:06:31,429 --> 01:06:33,429
It was good work.

854
01:06:33,429 --> 01:06:38,550
Welcome, welcome everybody.

855
01:06:38,550 --> 01:07:01,510
Lights on.

856
01:07:01,510 --> 01:07:03,510
Phelps, Bukowski. This your work?

857
01:07:03,510 --> 01:07:05,510
Can I help you, Detective?

858
01:07:05,510 --> 01:07:07,510
My lights are all fucked up.

859
01:07:07,510 --> 01:07:09,510
Yeah, I'll bet you did.

860
01:07:09,510 --> 01:07:11,510
This is a traffic case. You need something?

861
01:07:11,510 --> 01:07:13,510
I'm here to buy a drink

862
01:07:13,510 --> 01:07:15,510
for the two LAPD traffic cops

863
01:07:15,510 --> 01:07:17,510
who broke the back of Guy McCaffey's private army.

864
01:07:17,510 --> 01:07:19,510
You don't have a problem with that, do you, Captain?

865
01:07:21,510 --> 01:07:23,750
Go right ahead.

866
01:07:23,750 --> 01:07:25,750
Get in. I'm buying.

867
01:07:25,750 --> 01:07:44,179
I like this place.

868
01:07:44,179 --> 01:07:46,179
A lot of movie people hang out here.

869
01:07:46,179 --> 01:07:48,179
You like jazz, Cole? The hopheads love it.

870
01:07:48,179 --> 01:07:50,179
Sure, I guess.

871
01:07:50,179 --> 01:07:52,179
Big bands and swing, I can understand,

872
01:07:52,179 --> 01:07:54,179
but this bebop palaver?

873
01:07:54,179 --> 01:07:59,110
How are you supposed to dance to that?

874
01:07:59,110 --> 01:08:01,110
What helps, Leroy? Be nice to them.

875
01:08:01,110 --> 01:08:03,110
You'll like this place.

876
01:08:03,110 --> 01:08:07,210
They treat you right.

877
01:08:07,210 --> 01:08:09,210
You like a table, Leroy?

878
01:08:09,210 --> 01:08:11,210
What do you think we want to do? Stand at the bar like chumps?

879
01:08:11,210 --> 01:08:13,210
I'll get a table ready for you.

880
01:08:13,210 --> 01:08:15,210
Don't look so happy to see me, Alphonse.

881
01:08:15,210 --> 01:08:17,210
I might get the wrong impression.

882
01:08:17,210 --> 01:08:19,210
Cole, this is Alphonse.

883
01:08:19,210 --> 01:08:21,210
He's a French negro from Africa. Can you beat that?

884
01:08:21,210 --> 01:08:23,210
The Congo.

885
01:08:23,210 --> 01:08:25,210
A pleasure to meet you, Alphonse.

886
01:08:25,210 --> 01:08:27,210
Come on, Cole, you can meet Elsa

887
01:08:27,210 --> 01:08:29,210
while they're fixing us a table.

888
01:08:29,210 --> 01:08:31,510
I like her. She's something else.

889
01:08:31,510 --> 01:08:33,510
Maybe another night, Roy.

890
01:08:33,510 --> 01:08:35,510
She's pretty beat up about it.

891
01:08:35,510 --> 01:08:37,510
Get your hands off me.

892
01:08:37,510 --> 01:08:39,510
Don't ever tell me what to do or what not to do, Alphonse.

893
01:08:41,510 --> 01:08:43,510
You got a nice club here.

894
01:08:43,510 --> 01:08:45,510
Don't spoil it.

895
01:08:45,510 --> 01:08:48,710
If you will follow me, detectives,

896
01:08:48,710 --> 01:08:53,699
just through the door.

897
01:08:53,699 --> 01:08:55,699
He was my only real friend, Harlan.

898
01:08:55,699 --> 01:08:57,699
We went through it all.

899
01:08:57,699 --> 01:09:00,140
Do you realize what he meant to me?

900
01:09:00,140 --> 01:09:02,140
Of course I do.

901
01:09:02,140 --> 01:09:04,140
You said it was construction work.

902
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:06,140
It was an industrial accident, Elsa.

903
01:09:06,140 --> 01:09:08,140
How can I be held responsible?

904
01:09:08,140 --> 01:09:10,140
Elsa, are you going on?

905
01:09:10,140 --> 01:09:12,140
Louis, for God's sake,

906
01:09:12,140 --> 01:09:14,140
he was my best friend.

907
01:09:14,140 --> 01:09:16,140
The only man who ever loved me

908
01:09:16,140 --> 01:09:18,140
without putting his hands on me.

909
01:09:18,140 --> 01:09:20,140
Hi, Elsa.

910
01:09:20,140 --> 01:09:22,140
Here's someone I'd like you to meet.

911
01:09:22,140 --> 01:09:24,140
Cole Phelps, war hero and

912
01:09:24,140 --> 01:09:26,140
crime fighter extraordinaire.

913
01:09:26,140 --> 01:09:28,140
Why would I want to meet another

914
01:09:28,140 --> 01:09:30,140
fascist from the LAPD?

915
01:09:30,140 --> 01:09:32,819
Sorry about this, Cole.

916
01:09:32,819 --> 01:09:34,819
What an evening I'm having.

917
01:09:34,819 --> 01:09:36,819
First a negro puts his hands on me

918
01:09:36,819 --> 01:09:38,819
and then this.

919
01:09:38,819 --> 01:09:40,819
Who do you think you're talking to,

920
01:09:40,819 --> 01:09:42,819
you German junkie whore?

921
01:09:42,819 --> 01:09:44,819
I told you, this guy sucks.

922
01:09:44,819 --> 01:09:46,819
Do you hear me?

923
01:09:46,819 --> 01:09:49,960
Evening, Doc. How's business?

924
01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:51,960
Sanguine.

925
01:09:51,960 --> 01:09:54,199
Louis, help me here.

926
01:09:54,199 --> 01:09:56,199
I'm gonna have to give her

927
01:09:56,199 --> 01:09:58,199
something before her performance.

928
01:09:58,199 --> 01:10:00,199
Blow it off, Cole. These artsy-fartsy

929
01:10:00,199 --> 01:10:02,199
types always get a little flighty.

930
01:10:02,199 --> 01:10:04,199
Meet Dr. Harlan Fontaine,

931
01:10:04,199 --> 01:10:06,199
doctor to the stars.

932
01:10:06,199 --> 01:10:08,199
Mr. Fix-It to the mental wreckage

933
01:10:08,199 --> 01:10:10,199
of Hollywood.

934
01:10:10,199 --> 01:10:13,659
So what about

935
01:10:13,659 --> 01:10:15,659
that drink, boys?

936
01:10:15,659 --> 01:10:41,239
Alright. Case closed.

937
01:10:41,239 --> 01:10:45,979
13.

938
01:10:45,979 --> 01:10:50,010
Not great.

939
01:10:50,010 --> 01:11:02,420
It gets raided, says nothing.

940
01:11:02,420 --> 01:11:04,420
What? I just talked about it for like a full minute.

941
01:11:04,420 --> 01:11:22,020
Only a minute?

942
01:11:22,020 --> 01:11:37,829
Right, gentlemen, take your seats.

943
01:11:37,829 --> 01:11:40,260
Let's get this over before lunch.

944
01:11:40,260 --> 01:11:42,630
Clyde Rose of the

945
01:11:42,630 --> 01:11:44,630
homicide squad has decided to take care

946
01:11:44,630 --> 01:11:46,630
of the retirement. Sounds good.

947
01:11:46,630 --> 01:11:48,630
We will all miss Floyd on the steely edge

948
01:11:48,630 --> 01:11:50,630
he brought to his police work.

949
01:11:50,630 --> 01:11:52,630
The department has arranged a weed

950
01:11:52,630 --> 01:11:54,630
drink at the Galway Arms to quench the mighty

951
01:11:54,630 --> 01:11:56,630
thirst a man gets from

952
01:11:56,630 --> 01:11:58,630
25 years of police work.

953
01:11:58,630 --> 01:12:02,090
Floyd's departure

954
01:12:02,090 --> 01:12:04,090
leaves a place at the top table.

955
01:12:04,090 --> 01:12:06,090
And the chief is seen fit to promote

956
01:12:06,090 --> 01:12:08,090
coal felt from burglary to the

957
01:12:08,090 --> 01:12:10,090
homicide desk.

958
01:12:10,090 --> 01:12:12,090
Stand up, Phelps. Take a chair.

959
01:12:12,090 --> 01:12:15,800
You're in the major leagues now,

960
01:12:15,800 --> 01:12:18,100
Sonny. Rusty Galway,

961
01:12:18,100 --> 01:12:20,100
a fine lawman of the old school, will be

962
01:12:20,100 --> 01:12:24,260
taking you under his wing.

963
01:12:24,260 --> 01:12:26,260
Your first case is the murder of a woman

964
01:12:26,260 --> 01:12:28,260
found last night and bearing all the

965
01:12:28,260 --> 01:12:30,260
signs of the werewolf.

966
01:12:30,260 --> 01:12:39,159
Get out to the scene, lads.

967
01:12:39,159 --> 01:12:41,590
Okay. The streets of LA

968
01:12:41,590 --> 01:12:43,590
line you to patrol the city and attend street crimes.

969
01:12:43,590 --> 01:12:45,590
Each desk off is a new set of street

970
01:12:45,590 --> 01:12:49,109
crimes. Okay.

971
01:12:49,109 --> 01:12:51,109
Do you have the address?

972
01:12:51,109 --> 01:12:53,109
It's been all over KGPL.

973
01:12:53,109 --> 01:12:55,350
It's off Temple Street

974
01:12:55,350 --> 01:12:57,350
between Belmont and Glendale.

975
01:12:57,350 --> 01:13:00,229
Get the sensor bar ready,

976
01:13:00,229 --> 01:13:02,229
Galway. Are we about to see...

977
01:13:02,229 --> 01:13:04,229
I mean, I have a giant one that's ready, so...

978
01:13:04,229 --> 01:13:08,010
Oh, there's an oxymoron for you.

979
01:13:08,010 --> 01:13:13,000
I'd rather you took the wheel.

980
01:13:23,369 --> 01:13:25,739
Ow.

981
01:13:25,739 --> 01:13:31,300
All right, let's go.

982
01:13:31,300 --> 01:13:33,300
What happened to Rose? Parker lost the chief's job.

983
01:13:33,300 --> 01:13:35,300
The word is the chief is going to be hammered

984
01:13:35,300 --> 01:13:37,300
until they're both clearing the desk.

985
01:13:37,300 --> 01:13:39,300
Where does that leave you, Galway?

986
01:13:39,300 --> 01:13:41,300
We got a call. Hold on.

987
01:13:41,300 --> 01:13:43,300
Please me saddle with a chump like you, Phelps.

988
01:13:43,300 --> 01:13:45,300
I didn't ask for you, and I don't want you,

989
01:13:45,300 --> 01:13:47,300
so keep it to yourself.

990
01:13:47,300 --> 01:13:49,300
See if you can learn something about

991
01:13:49,300 --> 01:13:51,739
real cops.

992
01:13:51,739 --> 01:13:53,739
What did he mean by the werewolf?

993
01:13:53,739 --> 01:13:55,739
A dahlia. The daily news

994
01:13:55,739 --> 01:13:57,739
came out calling him the werewolf killer.

995
01:13:57,739 --> 01:13:59,739
The examiner came up with the black dahlia.

996
01:13:59,739 --> 01:14:01,739
Were we any closer to catching him?

997
01:14:01,739 --> 01:14:03,739
Not a chance.

998
01:14:03,739 --> 01:14:05,739
It's been months and hundreds of guys running down leagues

999
01:14:05,739 --> 01:14:07,739
and we got nothing.

1000
01:14:07,739 --> 01:14:09,739
You don't think this has anything? Why would you...

1001
01:14:09,739 --> 01:14:12,489
Don't do that. No, I don't.

1002
01:14:12,489 --> 01:14:14,489
3% of murders are domestic, Phelps.

1003
01:14:14,489 --> 01:14:16,489
Some guy gets into a beef with his wife, he takes it too far.

1004
01:14:16,489 --> 01:14:18,489
This would be the same.

1005
01:14:18,489 --> 01:14:20,489
But, cutting someone in half...

1006
01:14:20,489 --> 01:14:22,489
This is very far away.

1007
01:14:22,489 --> 01:14:24,489
This is a very far away crime that happened over here.

1008
01:14:24,489 --> 01:14:26,489
This is a war.

1009
01:14:26,489 --> 01:14:32,380
All right, what's it do?

1010
01:14:34,619 --> 01:14:41,270
A possible jumper?

1011
01:14:41,270 --> 01:14:43,829
You need to get up there.

1012
01:14:43,829 --> 01:14:45,829
Let me do the talking detective.

1013
01:14:45,829 --> 01:14:47,829
I know a ton of this psychology stuff.

1014
01:14:47,829 --> 01:14:49,829
Take the back alley and find a way up there.

1015
01:14:49,829 --> 01:14:52,649
I don't trust this guy.

1016
01:14:52,649 --> 01:14:54,649
Come on, Phelps, let's get moving.

1017
01:14:54,649 --> 01:14:57,659
Are you jumping?

1018
01:14:57,659 --> 01:15:00,760
Get sure you warn me where you do.

1019
01:15:00,760 --> 01:15:02,760
All right, so I gotta get up there and I gotta prevent him from jumping.

1020
01:15:02,760 --> 01:15:09,989
I don't know why for a second, I thought he was gonna kick me.

1021
01:15:09,989 --> 01:15:11,989
I'll bring you down with me, Phelps.

1022
01:15:11,989 --> 01:15:27,539
Should we not be sprinting at him like this?

1023
01:15:27,539 --> 01:15:30,489
Are you crazy?

1024
01:15:30,489 --> 01:15:32,489
What are you trying to do?

1025
01:15:32,489 --> 01:15:39,979
He's not just gonna do it, right?

1026
01:15:39,979 --> 01:15:41,979
Should I not have spread it up there?

1027
01:15:41,979 --> 01:15:43,979
Like, as fast as I can?

1028
01:15:43,979 --> 01:15:46,220
Is this what you wanted?

1029
01:15:46,220 --> 01:15:49,350
I can't do it.

1030
01:15:49,350 --> 01:15:51,720
I'll come quietly.

1031
01:15:51,720 --> 01:15:54,729
I need some help.

1032
01:15:54,729 --> 01:15:56,729
Please, you gotta get me some help.

1033
01:15:56,729 --> 01:16:00,060
I made it.

1034
01:16:00,060 --> 01:16:04,659
You're a danger to yourself and to others.

1035
01:16:04,659 --> 01:16:08,119
Why is everybody cheering?

1036
01:16:08,119 --> 01:16:11,829
I just gave like that.

1037
01:16:11,829 --> 01:16:13,829
That's right, everybody down there in my audience.

1038
01:16:13,829 --> 01:16:33,930
Let's do it.

1039
01:16:33,930 --> 01:16:47,560
Back to work we go.

1040
01:16:47,560 --> 01:16:49,560
Back to going the streets.

1041
01:16:49,560 --> 01:16:53,399
How many chapters have I completed?

1042
01:16:53,399 --> 01:16:56,409
Um...

1043
01:16:56,409 --> 01:16:58,409
I think this is case 10.

1044
01:16:58,409 --> 01:17:00,899
Or this would be case 10.

1045
01:17:00,899 --> 01:17:02,899
Coming up.

1046
01:17:02,899 --> 01:17:05,770
I think this is the second chapter.

1047
01:17:05,770 --> 01:17:09,100
I assume.

1048
01:17:09,100 --> 01:17:11,100
No engine sound for some reason.

1049
01:17:11,100 --> 01:17:13,659
I don't know why.

1050
01:17:13,659 --> 01:17:24,899
Not a scratch, I got it.

1051
01:17:24,899 --> 01:17:39,500
Hybrid car.

1052
01:17:39,500 --> 01:17:41,500
I feel like we should be in a different video game.

1053
01:17:41,500 --> 01:17:43,500
This music.

1054
01:17:43,500 --> 01:17:45,500
No engine sounds.

1055
01:17:45,500 --> 01:17:48,569
I feel like I should be searching for hidden objects.

1056
01:17:48,569 --> 01:17:50,569
I don't know why.

1057
01:17:50,569 --> 01:17:52,569
That's what I think of.

1058
01:17:52,569 --> 01:18:07,289
Give me a break.

1059
01:18:07,289 --> 01:18:09,289
I'll take it.

1060
01:18:09,289 --> 01:18:11,289
Bank of America?

1061
01:18:11,289 --> 01:18:20,699
Alright, let's go.

1062
01:18:20,699 --> 01:18:22,699
I want to do like all these.

1063
01:18:22,699 --> 01:18:36,840
I want to match the pre-game.

1064
01:18:36,840 --> 01:18:38,840
That's what I think of.

1065
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:42,869
I want to just match the pre-game sounds.

1066
01:18:42,869 --> 01:18:44,869
Like.

1067
01:18:44,869 --> 01:18:47,560
Cool.

1068
01:18:47,560 --> 01:18:50,119
Excellent.

1069
01:18:50,119 --> 01:19:00,789
Oh my god.

1070
01:19:00,789 --> 01:19:02,789
Slow and steady.

1071
01:19:02,789 --> 01:19:05,029
Come on.

1072
01:19:05,029 --> 01:19:07,029
It's not like I'm driving on the wrong side of the road or anything.

1073
01:19:07,029 --> 01:19:21,939
You know when people are in jeeps?

1074
01:19:21,939 --> 01:19:23,939
And they beep at each other.

1075
01:19:23,939 --> 01:19:26,439
This car is done.

1076
01:19:26,439 --> 01:19:28,439
This car is done.

1077
01:19:28,439 --> 01:19:30,439
Did anybody else hear the actual siren that drove by the house?

1078
01:19:30,439 --> 01:19:34,090
I don't know.

1079
01:19:34,090 --> 01:19:37,989
I don't know.

1080
01:19:37,989 --> 01:19:39,989
Did anybody else hear the actual siren that drove by the house?

1081
01:19:39,989 --> 01:19:49,189
I did.

1082
01:19:49,189 --> 01:19:51,189
Out of the car. Police.

1083
01:19:51,189 --> 01:20:03,289
You can't do this.

1084
01:20:03,289 --> 01:20:05,289
Does this one have engine sounds?

1085
01:20:05,289 --> 01:20:12,380
Kind of.

1086
01:20:12,380 --> 01:20:14,380
This is GTA now.

1087
01:20:14,380 --> 01:20:20,840
Can you do that?

1088
01:20:20,840 --> 01:20:22,840
FBI.

1089
01:20:22,840 --> 01:20:24,840
I'm taking the car.

1090
01:20:24,840 --> 01:20:28,680
You can?

1091
01:20:28,680 --> 01:20:30,680
I don't know if I would believe that person.

1092
01:20:30,680 --> 01:20:32,680
You know what I'm saying?

1093
01:20:32,680 --> 01:20:34,680
You could go get a fake badge from the party store.

1094
01:20:34,680 --> 01:20:36,680
You need your car.

1095
01:20:36,680 --> 01:20:48,579
What?

1096
01:20:48,579 --> 01:20:50,579
What's the situation?

1097
01:20:50,579 --> 01:20:52,579
Half a dozen shooters, sir. Cold blooded sons of bitches.

1098
01:20:52,579 --> 01:20:54,579
Real professionals.

1099
01:20:54,579 --> 01:20:56,579
What do you mean?

1100
01:20:56,579 --> 01:20:58,579
Witnesses say they bounced in, aced the guards, and went straight downstairs.

1101
01:20:58,579 --> 01:21:00,579
Christ knows who they're working for.

1102
01:21:00,579 --> 01:21:02,579
But whatever's in that vault, they want it bad.

1103
01:21:02,579 --> 01:21:14,409
They also shot at us.

1104
01:21:14,409 --> 01:21:16,409
I got an achievement made out of wood.

1105
01:21:16,409 --> 01:21:18,409
I got an achievement made out of wood.

1106
01:21:18,409 --> 01:21:45,270
Get off of this, please.

1107
01:21:45,270 --> 01:21:47,270
I sometimes just feel like my character is a fucking magnet.

1108
01:21:47,270 --> 01:21:51,430
And I'm running through a depolar field.

1109
01:21:51,430 --> 01:21:53,430
And I'm running through a depolar field.

1110
01:21:53,430 --> 01:21:55,430
Take the elevator.

1111
01:21:55,430 --> 01:21:57,430
Alright, I'll wait here.

1112
01:21:57,430 --> 01:22:00,699
Don't give them a chance to regroup.

1113
01:22:00,699 --> 01:22:02,869
Wish me luck.

1114
01:22:06,140 --> 01:22:12,090
If this were real life right now, I'd be going,

1115
01:22:12,090 --> 01:22:14,090
Fuck! Fuck!

1116
01:22:14,090 --> 01:22:16,090
Okay, fuck! Okay!

1117
01:22:16,090 --> 01:22:18,090
Okay, here we go!

1118
01:22:18,090 --> 01:22:20,090
That leaves you, pal.

1119
01:22:20,090 --> 01:22:29,500
In the vault.

1120
01:22:29,500 --> 01:22:34,420
Oh, what's taking so long?

1121
01:22:34,420 --> 01:22:44,090
And where the hell are you?

1122
01:22:44,090 --> 01:22:50,100
He's like, standing behind the car.

1123
01:22:50,100 --> 01:22:53,300
He's like, standing behind the car.

1124
01:22:53,300 --> 01:22:55,300
You can't live to tell the tale.

1125
01:22:55,300 --> 01:23:06,039
That's it.

1126
01:23:06,039 --> 01:23:08,279
That's all of them.

1127
01:23:08,279 --> 01:23:14,300
Let him live?

1128
01:23:14,300 --> 01:23:18,500
He had his opportunity.

1129
01:23:18,500 --> 01:23:20,500
Reload loudly in front of him.

1130
01:23:20,500 --> 01:23:22,500
Reload loudly in front of him.

1131
01:23:22,500 --> 01:23:26,090
Car 11K.

1132
01:23:26,090 --> 01:23:28,090
Shots fired, suspects are down.

1133
01:23:28,090 --> 01:23:30,090
We're code four here, but I need an ambulance at Bank of America.

1134
01:23:30,090 --> 01:23:32,090
Seventh and olive.

1135
01:23:32,090 --> 01:23:34,090
Identify coroner and detective headquarters.

1136
01:23:34,090 --> 01:23:36,390
Identify coroner and detective headquarters.

1137
01:23:36,390 --> 01:23:48,100
Okay, you ready to solve a mystery?

1138
01:23:48,100 --> 01:23:58,409
What is this fucking music?

1139
01:23:58,409 --> 01:24:00,409
What is this?

1140
01:24:00,409 --> 01:24:02,409
What is this?

1141
01:24:02,409 --> 01:24:06,439
Everybody's listening to the same song.

1142
01:24:06,439 --> 01:24:15,140
Either that, or this is the intro

1143
01:24:15,140 --> 01:24:17,829
Either that, or this is the intro

1144
01:24:17,829 --> 01:24:19,829
to a British television mystery show.

1145
01:24:19,829 --> 01:24:23,100
This is where the credits show up.

1146
01:24:23,100 --> 01:24:26,619
Calm down!

1147
01:24:26,619 --> 01:24:28,619
And Arthur Bradbury as

1148
01:24:28,619 --> 01:24:51,850
Detective Doohickey.

1149
01:24:51,850 --> 01:24:53,850
Gotta play some hidden object games now.

1150
01:24:53,850 --> 01:25:02,170
I was thinking about it.

1151
01:25:02,170 --> 01:25:05,689
Oh my god.

1152
01:25:05,689 --> 01:25:07,689
This is more side tracking than in Red Dead.

1153
01:25:07,689 --> 01:25:13,380
And I have to do it though,

1154
01:25:13,380 --> 01:25:15,380
because these are all interesting.

1155
01:25:15,380 --> 01:25:17,380
Oh, I almost bulled that guy.

1156
01:25:17,380 --> 01:25:27,560
Do the murder investigation.

1157
01:25:27,560 --> 01:25:29,560
What about these murder investigations?

1158
01:25:29,560 --> 01:25:32,439
Bank of America.

1159
01:25:32,439 --> 01:25:34,869
Guy jumping off the building.

1160
01:25:34,869 --> 01:25:38,390
I need to do these too.

1161
01:25:38,390 --> 01:25:43,380
How is this stalling?

1162
01:25:43,380 --> 01:25:45,380
I'm playing the game!

1163
01:25:45,380 --> 01:25:47,380
Stalling would be this!

1164
01:25:47,380 --> 01:25:52,300
Hey, um...

1165
01:25:52,300 --> 01:25:54,300
Does anybody know...

1166
01:25:54,300 --> 01:25:56,300
Does anybody know what time Evo starts?

1167
01:25:56,300 --> 01:26:00,520
Uh...

1168
01:26:00,520 --> 01:26:02,520
It's like next month, right?

1169
01:26:02,520 --> 01:26:05,210
That's stalling!

1170
01:26:05,210 --> 01:26:07,699
I'm playing...

1171
01:26:07,699 --> 01:26:18,520
What am I doing?

1172
01:26:18,520 --> 01:26:20,520
How can you be stalling if you're playing

1173
01:26:20,520 --> 01:26:22,520
the content in the game that you're playing?

1174
01:26:22,520 --> 01:26:26,680
Maybe if I turned on the webcam?

1175
01:26:26,680 --> 01:26:28,680
Maybe if I turned on the webcam?

1176
01:26:28,680 --> 01:26:30,680
There's always a cop

1177
01:26:30,680 --> 01:26:32,680
that's just Kenny from South Park.

1178
01:26:32,680 --> 01:26:34,680
He dies instantly.

1179
01:26:45,880 --> 01:26:59,239
Give it up!

1180
01:26:59,239 --> 01:27:01,239
I can't scare him? He's not a horse.

1181
01:27:01,239 --> 01:27:04,819
I'm not trying to kill him.

1182
01:27:04,819 --> 01:27:06,819
I'm trying to scare him so he goes...

1183
01:27:06,819 --> 01:27:15,079
How did he get up there? A ladder.

1184
01:27:15,079 --> 01:27:18,659
Perfect. I'm not trying to shoot him.

1185
01:27:18,659 --> 01:27:20,659
I'm trying to make him freak out.

1186
01:27:20,659 --> 01:27:25,079
Oh, he's so fucking far away though.

1187
01:27:25,079 --> 01:27:27,079
I'm gonna have to shoot him.

1188
01:27:27,079 --> 01:27:31,989
All right, now stop. Give up.

1189
01:27:31,989 --> 01:27:36,659
I'm trying to shoot him like defeat.

1190
01:27:36,659 --> 01:27:38,840
I'm trying to shoot him like defeat.

1191
01:27:40,840 --> 01:27:45,819
Stop it!

1192
01:27:45,819 --> 01:28:00,149
All right, got him.

1193
01:28:00,149 --> 01:28:05,659
All right, you're going to jail.

1194
01:28:16,380 --> 01:28:18,380
See? I didn't use any force there.

1195
01:28:18,380 --> 01:28:20,380
Everybody that

1196
01:28:20,380 --> 01:28:22,380
likes to make fun of me for...

1197
01:28:22,380 --> 01:28:24,380
Oh, Djerba just shot him in the head.

1198
01:28:24,380 --> 01:28:28,220
But I need to find

1199
01:28:28,220 --> 01:28:43,060
those mystery coins.

1200
01:28:43,060 --> 01:28:45,060
I didn't kill him. What do you mean I killed him?

1201
01:28:45,060 --> 01:28:47,619
He's just gonna be missing a few toes.

1202
01:28:47,619 --> 01:29:00,300
4 means dead.

1203
01:29:00,300 --> 01:29:11,289
No, it doesn't.

1204
01:29:11,289 --> 01:29:14,869
No, what? Yes, it does.

1205
01:29:14,869 --> 01:29:16,869
Connect 4 means you won the fucking round

1206
01:29:16,869 --> 01:29:18,869
and you go on to play the next one.

1207
01:29:18,869 --> 01:29:20,869
He's fine. He just had a couple of bruises.

1208
01:29:20,869 --> 01:29:25,859
I don't know the

1209
01:29:25,859 --> 01:29:27,859
police numbers. I don't know the police numbers!

1210
01:29:27,859 --> 01:29:34,390
They just make him up.

1211
01:29:34,390 --> 01:29:36,390
That's not real.

1212
01:29:36,390 --> 01:29:38,760
That's just like a police movie

1213
01:29:38,760 --> 01:29:40,760
TV show thing. We've got a code

1214
01:29:40,760 --> 01:29:42,760
141-2652 at

1215
01:29:42,760 --> 01:29:44,760
South Point 4 Boulevard.

1216
01:29:44,760 --> 01:29:46,760
It's all just, it's like saying

1217
01:29:46,760 --> 01:29:48,760
555-5555 for a telephone number.

1218
01:29:48,760 --> 01:30:06,810
Oh, get the sensor ready!

1219
01:30:06,810 --> 01:30:08,810
I got a haircut.

1220
01:30:23,300 --> 01:30:25,300
He's good, Rusty.

1221
01:30:25,300 --> 01:30:27,300
He even sounds genuine.

1222
01:30:27,300 --> 01:30:29,300
That's Phelps, guys. The war hero.

1223
01:30:29,300 --> 01:30:31,300
Defending the honor of murdered humps.

1224
01:30:31,300 --> 01:30:33,300
It's the same face.

1225
01:30:33,300 --> 01:30:35,300
They're used to it, Phelps.

1226
01:30:35,300 --> 01:30:37,300
Moving along, guys. You got your pictures, you got your headlines.

1227
01:30:37,300 --> 01:30:39,300
Now scram.

1228
01:30:39,300 --> 01:30:51,449
Screeks. Tree.

1229
01:30:51,449 --> 01:30:55,739
Body.

1230
01:30:55,739 --> 01:31:08,149
Oh. Trollman, this your beat?

1231
01:31:08,149 --> 01:31:10,149
Yes, sir. Well, part of it.

1232
01:31:10,149 --> 01:31:12,149
Kids park here, they use it like a

1233
01:31:12,149 --> 01:31:14,149
lover's lane. It's a

1234
01:31:14,149 --> 01:31:16,149
neighborhood. Some trouble, but

1235
01:31:16,149 --> 01:31:18,779
nothing like this.

1236
01:31:18,779 --> 01:31:21,590
It's known locally as the Morse.

1237
01:31:21,590 --> 01:31:23,590
You were first on the scene? Yes, detective.

1238
01:31:23,590 --> 01:31:25,590
No one's disturbed the body?

1239
01:31:25,590 --> 01:31:27,590
No, sir. We cleared out

1240
01:31:27,590 --> 01:31:29,590
them vulture reporters so Pinker in the corner could work.

1241
01:31:29,590 --> 01:31:31,590
They're waiting to talk to you.

1242
01:31:31,590 --> 01:31:33,590
Go house to house and see what you come up with.

1243
01:31:33,590 --> 01:31:37,560
This ain't gonna work. Too bad.

1244
01:31:37,560 --> 01:31:41,850
Hold on.

1245
01:31:41,850 --> 01:31:50,619
It's not gonna work.

1246
01:31:50,619 --> 01:31:52,789
It's not gonna work, guys.

1247
01:31:52,789 --> 01:31:54,789
This is an adult

1248
01:31:54,789 --> 01:31:56,789
part of the stream.

1249
01:31:56,789 --> 01:31:58,789
If you're not at least

1250
01:31:58,789 --> 01:32:00,789
allowed to go to an R-rated

1251
01:32:00,789 --> 01:32:02,789
movie, then you're not

1252
01:32:02,789 --> 01:32:14,699
you gotta get out of here. Cause of death?

1253
01:32:14,699 --> 01:32:17,130
Could be the head injuries.

1254
01:32:17,130 --> 01:32:19,130
She hasn't been badly stalled.

1255
01:32:19,130 --> 01:32:21,619
The cuts look superficial.

1256
01:32:21,619 --> 01:32:32,310
I'll know for sure in an hour.

1257
01:32:32,310 --> 01:32:34,310
What caused the blunt force injury to the face?

1258
01:32:34,310 --> 01:32:36,310
Could be anything from a

1259
01:32:36,310 --> 01:32:38,310
baseball bat to a lug wrench.

1260
01:32:38,310 --> 01:32:40,310
I'll have more details after the autopsy.

1261
01:32:40,310 --> 01:32:42,310
So you're allowed to go to an R-rated

1262
01:32:42,310 --> 01:32:44,310
movie if your parents let you.

1263
01:32:44,310 --> 01:32:46,310
Yeah, but your parents need to be

1264
01:32:46,310 --> 01:32:48,310
watching the stream with you.

1265
01:32:48,310 --> 01:32:50,310
You can't prove that to me.

1266
01:32:50,310 --> 01:33:08,810
Am I gonna get in fucking trouble

1267
01:33:08,810 --> 01:33:15,909
for this shit? I don't know.

1268
01:33:15,909 --> 01:33:29,020
Hmm. Interesting.

1269
01:33:29,020 --> 01:33:39,180
Okay. Anything else?

1270
01:33:39,180 --> 01:33:42,060
It's not gonna work.

1271
01:33:42,060 --> 01:33:46,340
What about this wound on the

1272
01:33:46,340 --> 01:33:48,340
bite mark? Something removed.

1273
01:33:48,340 --> 01:33:50,340
A ring, most likely. I assume it was

1274
01:33:50,340 --> 01:33:52,340
taken post-mortem. Missing ring?

1275
01:33:52,340 --> 01:34:07,750
Okay. I don't know!

1276
01:34:07,750 --> 01:34:09,750
I don't know what to do!

1277
01:34:09,750 --> 01:34:14,869
Whatever. If you're not at least

1278
01:34:14,869 --> 01:34:16,869
17 with the parent's permission,

1279
01:34:16,869 --> 01:34:19,939
you're not allowed to watch the stream at this point forward.

1280
01:34:19,939 --> 01:34:22,630
That goes for all of you. 18?

1281
01:34:22,630 --> 01:34:25,750
You're not allowed to be here.

1282
01:34:25,750 --> 01:34:37,270
Unless your mother told you it was okay.

1283
01:34:37,270 --> 01:34:39,270
In fact, no.

1284
01:34:39,270 --> 01:34:41,270
You're not even allowed to be here.

1285
01:34:41,270 --> 01:34:43,510
Even if your mother says it's okay, you're not supposed to be here.

1286
01:34:43,510 --> 01:34:55,609
You understand? Okay, I got it.

1287
01:35:06,550 --> 01:35:08,550
Either way, I'll run tests on the lipstick.

1288
01:35:08,550 --> 01:35:10,550
Any idea of the time of death?

1289
01:35:10,550 --> 01:35:12,550
From the temperature, I'd say after midnight.

1290
01:35:12,550 --> 01:35:14,550
I'll confirm with you later.

1291
01:35:14,550 --> 01:35:18,520
Oh!

1292
01:35:18,520 --> 01:35:20,949
Oh my god!

1293
01:35:20,949 --> 01:35:23,319
I thought that was...

1294
01:35:23,319 --> 01:35:31,060
What can you tell me about the shoe prints?

1295
01:35:31,060 --> 01:35:33,560
Men's size 8.

1296
01:35:33,560 --> 01:35:35,560
Pinker lifted impressions for me to

1297
01:35:35,560 --> 01:35:37,989
compare back at the lab.

1298
01:35:37,989 --> 01:35:41,000
Size 8. Men's size 8.

1299
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:43,000
And one of them has bird shit all over it.

1300
01:35:43,000 --> 01:36:01,289
Look at a globe?

1301
01:36:01,289 --> 01:36:03,289
Looks like some kind of puzzle or parlor game.

1302
01:36:03,289 --> 01:36:07,640
It opens up and there's going to be

1303
01:36:07,640 --> 01:36:09,640
chocolate inside.

1304
01:36:09,640 --> 01:36:21,850
Okay, okay.

1305
01:36:21,850 --> 01:36:24,470
See, that's

1306
01:36:24,470 --> 01:36:26,470
the top half of North America

1307
01:36:26,470 --> 01:36:28,470
and this is the bottom half of North America.

1308
01:36:28,470 --> 01:36:31,989
Okay.

1309
01:36:31,989 --> 01:36:34,489
Like that.

1310
01:36:34,489 --> 01:36:36,489
There's a couple islands in between.

1311
01:36:36,489 --> 01:36:38,489
No, not quite. Maybe a little bit more.

1312
01:36:38,489 --> 01:36:42,899
There we go. Okay.

1313
01:36:42,899 --> 01:36:53,720
There it is. Alright, now I actually

1314
01:36:53,720 --> 01:36:55,720
fucked it up, so hold on.

1315
01:36:55,720 --> 01:37:00,010
It looks like this.

1316
01:37:00,010 --> 01:37:02,010
There's no sense of any

1317
01:37:02,010 --> 01:37:11,930
globe geography.

1318
01:37:11,930 --> 01:37:13,930
Oh, I couldn't even do it.

1319
01:37:13,930 --> 01:37:17,579
The property of the Bomba Club

1320
01:37:17,579 --> 01:37:19,579
North Spring Street,

1321
01:37:19,579 --> 01:37:21,579
downtown.

1322
01:37:21,579 --> 01:37:31,560
That's not real. See, I told you.

1323
01:37:31,560 --> 01:37:33,560
Swiggity Swanky just gave $50

1324
01:37:33,560 --> 01:37:35,560
right now. 50.

1325
01:37:35,560 --> 01:37:37,560
50 bucks from Swiggity Swanky.

1326
01:37:37,560 --> 01:37:39,560
To prevent a Twitch ban,

1327
01:37:39,560 --> 01:37:41,560
delete the VOD.

1328
01:37:41,560 --> 01:37:43,560
Delete the evidence?

1329
01:37:43,560 --> 01:37:45,560
I'm playing a detective game right now

1330
01:37:45,560 --> 01:37:48,250
and you want me to delete evidence?

1331
01:37:48,250 --> 01:37:50,250
That would go against

1332
01:37:50,250 --> 01:37:52,250
Connor Phelps' Code of Conduct here. I'm not going to do that.

1333
01:37:52,250 --> 01:37:58,579
Thank you so much for the 50 bucks, though.

1334
01:37:58,579 --> 01:38:02,550
Really appreciate it, dude. That's a lot of money. Thank you.

1335
01:38:02,550 --> 01:38:13,420
The victim's bag?

1336
01:38:13,420 --> 01:38:16,170
We've got keys,

1337
01:38:16,170 --> 01:38:19,939
battery.

1338
01:38:19,939 --> 01:38:21,939
Looks brand new. Can't be the one used on the bottom.

1339
01:38:21,939 --> 01:38:23,939
I don't know why I was just going to say this.

1340
01:38:23,939 --> 01:38:25,939
And you're talking about me being concerned about

1341
01:38:25,939 --> 01:38:28,760
T.O.S.

1342
01:38:28,760 --> 01:38:30,760
I was about to just say two words.

1343
01:38:30,760 --> 01:38:33,260
That was it.

1344
01:38:33,260 --> 01:38:35,260
Three letter, four letter.

1345
01:38:35,260 --> 01:38:38,710
That's all I was going to say.

1346
01:38:38,710 --> 01:38:40,710
I don't know why I was just going to say that.

1347
01:38:40,710 --> 01:38:45,829
What's wrong with me?

1348
01:38:45,829 --> 01:38:47,829
What have you guys done to me?

1349
01:38:47,829 --> 01:38:50,840
I used to be so wholesome.

1350
01:38:50,840 --> 01:38:54,359
But I didn't even swear.

1351
01:38:54,359 --> 01:38:56,359
Can we get to the bomba?

1352
01:38:56,359 --> 01:39:07,859
Dude.

1353
01:39:07,859 --> 01:39:09,859
Come on. 15 seconds. I got the achievement.

1354
01:39:09,859 --> 01:39:22,220
15 seconds. Jump over three things.

1355
01:39:22,220 --> 01:39:24,220
How about we go to the bomba?

1356
01:39:24,220 --> 01:39:37,829
The bomba.

1357
01:39:37,829 --> 01:39:39,829
You're driving, you maniac.

1358
01:39:39,829 --> 01:39:41,829
My name's Jerma. I just look at map.

1359
01:39:41,829 --> 01:39:44,069
And see that it

1360
01:39:44,069 --> 01:39:46,250
I drive that way.

1361
01:39:46,250 --> 01:39:48,250
Blip is straight ahead. I drive straight ahead.

1362
01:39:48,250 --> 01:39:55,159
Me Jerma, me just fall off.

1363
01:39:55,159 --> 01:39:57,159
Cole, come on.

1364
01:39:57,159 --> 01:39:59,460
Okay, me go right now.

1365
01:39:59,460 --> 01:40:02,020
This is the cookie monster.

1366
01:40:02,020 --> 01:40:04,020
This is not in the right voice.

1367
01:40:04,020 --> 01:40:06,899
The werewolf? For my money?

1368
01:40:06,899 --> 01:40:08,899
We can't rule it out. We need to work the evidence.

1369
01:40:08,899 --> 01:40:10,899
You'd love that, wouldn't you?

1370
01:40:10,899 --> 01:40:12,899
A big head to hang on the wall.

1371
01:40:12,899 --> 01:40:15,079
For the decade.

1372
01:40:15,079 --> 01:40:17,079
Been working evidence and beat EKs for six months and got nicks.

1373
01:40:17,079 --> 01:40:19,079
There's a difference, Rusty.

1374
01:40:19,079 --> 01:40:21,079
Oh? Yeah? I just don't be working it today.

1375
01:40:21,079 --> 01:40:23,079
Okay, odd shot.

1376
01:40:23,079 --> 01:40:25,079
What's more like it?

1377
01:40:25,079 --> 01:40:27,079
The werewolf come back well, leaving us a note in the corpse?

1378
01:40:27,079 --> 01:40:29,079
He clearly has a thing for power.

1379
01:40:29,079 --> 01:40:31,079
Power over women.

1380
01:40:31,079 --> 01:40:33,079
Why not power over the police department as well?

1381
01:40:33,079 --> 01:40:35,079
Let me finish this.

1382
01:40:35,079 --> 01:40:37,079
A guy opens his mouth again after six months.

1383
01:40:37,079 --> 01:40:39,079
I can't believe it.

1384
01:40:39,079 --> 01:40:41,380
Come on.

1385
01:40:41,380 --> 01:40:43,380
Come on. I don't got all day.

1386
01:40:43,380 --> 01:40:46,329
Finish, Phelps.

1387
01:40:46,329 --> 01:40:48,329
A guy opens his mouth again after six months of shtoon.

1388
01:40:48,329 --> 01:40:50,329
Or some...

1389
01:40:50,329 --> 01:40:52,329
Breathe, Phelps.

1390
01:40:52,329 --> 01:40:54,329
Breathe, dammit.

1391
01:40:54,329 --> 01:40:58,300
I turned off the dialogue.

1392
01:40:58,300 --> 01:41:00,789
That's not totally fantastical.

1393
01:41:00,789 --> 01:41:02,789
You know, the examiner in the daily news might be good at coming up with...

1394
01:41:02,789 --> 01:41:04,789
Turn on cinematic camera?

1395
01:41:04,789 --> 01:41:06,789
Can you? There is none.

1396
01:41:06,789 --> 01:41:08,789
There's a reason we didn't get the son of a bitch after the short murder was them locusts.

1397
01:41:08,789 --> 01:41:10,789
What do you think the werewolf killer is now?

1398
01:41:10,789 --> 01:41:12,789
What do you think the werewolf killer is now?

1399
01:41:12,789 --> 01:41:14,789
What do you think the tool keys are now?

1400
01:41:14,789 --> 01:41:16,789
...somewhere else with the armed forces.

1401
01:41:16,789 --> 01:41:18,789
San Quentin.

1402
01:41:18,789 --> 01:41:20,789
Another town.

1403
01:41:20,789 --> 01:41:23,029
Another country. Who knows?

1404
01:41:23,029 --> 01:41:25,029
So, Phelps, I understand you want to turn this into a big case.

1405
01:41:25,029 --> 01:41:27,029
But it doesn't work like that, alright?

1406
01:41:27,029 --> 01:41:29,029
A case will come and find you.

1407
01:41:29,029 --> 01:41:31,029
Can't make it something it ain't, understand?

1408
01:41:31,029 --> 01:41:33,029
So you don't think the werewolf has continued to operate in the Los Angeles area?

1409
01:41:33,029 --> 01:41:35,029
No chance.

1410
01:41:35,029 --> 01:41:37,029
We would have found him.

1411
01:41:37,029 --> 01:41:41,430
I need Sentra again.

1412
01:41:41,430 --> 01:41:52,310
Just go easy, Phelps.

1413
01:41:52,630 --> 01:42:29,560
Say something

1414
01:42:30,079 --> 01:42:46,649
Gentleman, what can I get you Phelps and Galloway LAPD chocolate nothing here last night? Yes

1415
01:42:46,649 --> 01:42:49,970
I help officer you can start with your name

1416
01:42:50,649 --> 01:42:56,930
Garrett Mason, you're the regular bartender on life. I'm a temporary barman. I work for an agency

1417
01:42:56,930 --> 01:43:00,529
I fill in at bars across town. Do you remember a woman who came in here last night?

1418
01:43:01,170 --> 01:43:06,170
Five feet seven about 110 pounds blonde hair about 40 years of age

1419
01:43:06,810 --> 01:43:08,810
You mean Celine Henry?

1420
01:43:10,460 --> 01:43:12,460
You know her name. Yes

1421
01:43:12,699 --> 01:43:17,989
Do you know anything about her? I don't but the owner mr. McCall serves her most nights

1422
01:43:18,390 --> 01:43:20,390
Would you like to speak to him? I would

1423
01:43:20,710 --> 01:43:26,609
He said to the back of the club. Where's the hibiscus? You can't miss him. Is there anything else?

1424
01:43:27,489 --> 01:43:31,779
Quiet away Phelps. I'll stay here. I'm a little parched

1425
01:43:32,699 --> 01:43:34,699
Warming three fingers of rye

1426
01:43:35,180 --> 01:43:38,500
Say honey, what time you get off?

1427
01:43:39,380 --> 01:43:47,180
Where is on a tip refill my coffee next time honey, that's probably the guy just sitting back here by himself

1428
01:43:48,100 --> 01:43:54,060
Detective Phelps LAPD. We're investigating the murder of Celine Henry going to pay you know her Celine

1429
01:43:58,920 --> 01:44:00,920
Sure, I know her she and I and

1430
01:44:01,600 --> 01:44:04,319
Jacob her husband we go way back. She was here last night

1431
01:44:05,039 --> 01:44:07,079
Sure. She's a regular Celine is

1432
01:44:07,960 --> 01:44:11,220
was a

1433
01:44:11,220 --> 01:44:15,079
Lovely woman. Okay

1434
01:44:15,079 --> 01:44:16,789
McCall

1435
01:44:16,789 --> 01:44:25,289
Hmm. Hey, you spray me with that flower

1436
01:44:26,010 --> 01:44:30,199
Was mrs. Henry here with anyone last night? Not at first

1437
01:44:31,470 --> 01:44:34,909
Celine already had quite a head start, but she attracted attention

1438
01:44:35,670 --> 01:44:36,909
certainly a

1439
01:44:36,909 --> 01:44:39,909
Few gentlemen became very enamored with her and her stories

1440
01:44:41,710 --> 01:44:53,539
One guy in particular one guy in particular, you know him going no

1441
01:44:54,479 --> 01:44:58,670
He's been in a couple of times. Did they leave together?

1442
01:44:59,170 --> 01:45:00,170
Yes

1443
01:45:00,170 --> 01:45:01,930
at around 11

1444
01:45:01,930 --> 01:45:04,810
If it helps I made the guy's license plate. Ooh

1445
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:16,399
I think this could be a great help sir. Thank you eight eight nine nine

1446
01:45:17,239 --> 01:45:22,729
Okay, anything else? That's it

1447
01:45:22,970 --> 01:45:25,720
You're a license plate maker

1448
01:45:28,819 --> 01:45:30,819
All right, so she's missing a ring

1449
01:45:31,300 --> 01:45:35,460
Mrs. Henry appeared to be missing a ring torn from her finger, but not her wedding finger

1450
01:45:36,340 --> 01:45:38,460
Celine always wore a red garnet ring

1451
01:45:39,140 --> 01:45:41,140
on the large side

1452
01:45:41,300 --> 01:45:46,380
Larger than life like Celine herself. Did she have it a long time? Sure

1453
01:45:47,500 --> 01:45:52,149
It's way back in her flying days. Did her husband buy it for no it was

1454
01:45:53,029 --> 01:45:55,029
It's before Jacob

1455
01:45:55,750 --> 01:46:00,420
Haha. Oh, yeah

1456
01:46:00,420 --> 01:46:04,020
Really? You got an itch in your ass or what's happening here, man?

1457
01:46:04,020 --> 01:46:09,579
I think you know where the ring came from and I think you're gonna tell me. Okay, I bought it years ago

1458
01:46:09,779 --> 01:46:12,760
Got him. I carried a torch for Celine in those days

1459
01:46:13,479 --> 01:46:15,479
I guess I always have

1460
01:46:15,960 --> 01:46:24,170
Roll man never knew about it. Okay, so knowledge of we not now we know

1461
01:46:25,050 --> 01:46:27,050
You know a lot more than you. Yeah

1462
01:46:27,689 --> 01:46:29,369
You know the husband?

1463
01:46:29,369 --> 01:46:31,229
Sure. I know Jacob

1464
01:46:31,229 --> 01:46:32,829
He was in the corps

1465
01:46:32,829 --> 01:46:35,869
He met Celine on a furlough and married her when the war was finished

1466
01:46:37,050 --> 01:46:39,050
Put up with a load of shit

1467
01:46:39,289 --> 01:46:42,920
Do you think he killed his wife? No

1468
01:46:44,039 --> 01:46:46,039
No, not in my opinion

1469
01:46:47,310 --> 01:46:50,430
All right, this guy's got this guy that was very clear

1470
01:46:51,850 --> 01:46:53,850
Those are very clear. I do know

1471
01:46:55,210 --> 01:46:57,930
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, I don't think so

1472
01:46:58,489 --> 01:47:01,930
So if it wasn't Jacob, then you probably let her out of here with the guy who killed her

1473
01:47:02,010 --> 01:47:07,369
How do you feel about that stole the attitude? Will you know maybe not I tried to get on to Jacob

1474
01:47:08,170 --> 01:47:09,609
I rang him up

1475
01:47:09,609 --> 01:47:11,609
Asked him to come pick her up like usual

1476
01:47:12,250 --> 01:47:14,750
But he refused

1477
01:47:14,989 --> 01:47:17,899
As she picked some night to push him over the edge

1478
01:47:18,779 --> 01:47:22,760
I rang him back around 11 30, but got no answer

1479
01:47:24,489 --> 01:47:28,250
One out of four again. Thanks. Mr. McCaul. Oh, do you think three out of three? Correct?

1480
01:47:28,409 --> 01:47:30,409
Would you have an address for Celine?

1481
01:47:30,489 --> 01:47:38,189
Three one out of three zero, correct union avenue knows I had to send her home in enough cabs to remember that

1482
01:47:38,350 --> 01:47:43,470
All right, we're going to investigate her residence

1483
01:47:43,789 --> 01:47:48,279
And see a telephone call it in

1484
01:47:51,310 --> 01:47:57,470
Let's get out of here. Can I use your phone? What's the hurry? My stool was just starting to warm up. What is this?

1485
01:47:58,489 --> 01:48:00,489
Coke jack doesn't pertain to the case

1486
01:48:02,699 --> 01:48:05,000
Sir, can you put that down?

1487
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:07,000
Where's your telephone? Do I need permission?

1488
01:48:13,949 --> 01:48:23,880
Operator give me dispatch putting you through now coal felps batch 12 47

1489

1492
01:48:40,670 --> 01:48:42,039

1493
01:48:42,119 --> 01:48:45,819
Thanks, ma'am

1494
01:48:45,819 --> 01:48:47,819
Okay, let's go

1495
01:48:47,899 --> 01:48:49,899
Is there anything else I need to do in here a waitress?

1496
01:48:50,140 --> 01:48:51,899
Can I have another spoon?

1497
01:48:51,899 --> 01:48:55,310
another spoon

1498
01:48:55,310 --> 01:49:01,819
Is the guy eating a candle?

1499
01:49:01,819 --> 01:49:03,819
I just love the waxy part

1500
01:49:04,380 --> 01:49:06,140
Um, okay, I think we just leave

1501
01:49:06,140 --> 01:49:11,260
Get some air in here, man

1502
01:49:11,260 --> 01:49:17,000
Where's my partner my part? Where's my oh, he's in the car already. Wow

1503
01:49:17,800 --> 01:49:26,119
Let's go to the uh, anri residence

1504
01:49:29,659 --> 01:49:33,420
Don't don't don't don't do any cookies about the just go this way

1505
01:49:34,939 --> 01:49:39,819
You find the booze helps you get through a working day sharpens my investigatory instincts

1506
01:49:40,619 --> 01:49:47,500
A smart lawyer might use that to throw out anything you collect today smart man might know it's unwise to stand between the patient

1507
01:49:47,500 --> 01:49:51,739
I know it's not a job as long as you're not falling over rusty. I'll let it slide

1508
01:49:52,460 --> 01:49:54,460
That's mighty kind

1509
01:49:54,859 --> 01:49:57,500
You know, you picked the wrong job welcome to the stream everybody

1510
01:49:57,579 --> 01:50:03,600
I hope you're having a good saturday afternoon to do the best we can in this position as homicide detectives that responsibility

1511
01:50:03,979 --> 01:50:06,539
Is all the more serious. What is today? No, don't tell me let me guess

1512
01:50:07,180 --> 01:50:09,180
It's not political. It's practical

1513
01:50:09,340 --> 01:50:13,739
Maybe the men combing hollywood boulevard. It was thursday two days ago yesterday more interested

1514
01:50:13,739 --> 01:50:17,739
So today is today is thursday that would have led to her killer. I think today's friday

1515
01:50:17,739 --> 01:50:19,020
If only you'd been there

1516
01:50:19,020 --> 01:50:23,659
I don't know betty short be alive the japs would have spared pearl harbor

1517
01:50:23,979 --> 01:50:29,119
Our ancestors wouldn't have tasted the forbidden fruit minor syntactical error detective galloway

1518
01:50:31,260 --> 01:50:33,260
Whoa there

1519
01:50:34,039 --> 01:50:37,239
I'm, oh guys i'm on pacific time. So it's different for me. I'm like a whole day

1520
01:50:37,479 --> 01:50:45,479
Minor syntactical error detective galloway. I never claimed to be able to prevent crimes. I only suggested a proficiency in solving them

1521
01:50:46,039 --> 01:50:53,479
Guess that's the drink slowing you down. Oh my god, brother. Oh brother worse than I could ever three hours equals a whole day

1522
01:50:53,560 --> 01:51:01,659
I know you thought nevada was mountain time. It is pacific time because it sits right there on the edge on the bottom tail part

1523
01:51:02,619 --> 01:51:04,460
right next to calc 40

1524
01:51:04,460 --> 01:51:06,220
in fact

1525
01:51:06,300 --> 01:51:08,060
driving from

1526
01:51:08,060 --> 01:51:11,500
Las vegas to los angeles takes about three and a half

1527
01:51:15,180 --> 01:51:18,699
That guy's gonna explode I didn't do it that's how we got it we got a code four

1528
01:51:20,880 --> 01:51:23,840
What's your code? No, uh, we got another code four

1529
01:51:24,399 --> 01:51:26,479
Maybe I drive better if you shut the hell up

1530
01:51:27,210 --> 01:51:28,170
See

1531
01:51:28,170 --> 01:51:31,760
That's what I have to say. Maybe I would drive better

1532
01:51:40,350 --> 01:51:42,350
Yeah, i'm gonna get another code four here

1533
01:51:42,430 --> 01:51:46,750
I'm currently sitting inside of a car about to explode just might as well call it in and get it ready

1534
01:51:47,710 --> 01:51:49,149
and uh have a

1535
01:51:49,149 --> 01:51:51,149
That's when they cut out because the car exploded

1536
01:51:54,350 --> 01:51:56,350
Hello, who's here?

1537
01:52:16,800 --> 01:52:18,800
I can't just go to the front door

1538
01:52:20,939 --> 01:52:22,939
What was that the back door?

1539
01:52:25,050 --> 01:52:27,739
I have to look in the

1540
01:52:28,300 --> 01:52:30,300
That I have to go in the front door

1541
01:52:31,720 --> 01:52:33,800
All right, come on. That's a weird front door. It is

1542
01:52:35,130 --> 01:52:39,289
What is this door? I've never seen a house with a door wedged into the side like that

1543
01:52:39,689 --> 01:52:42,569
I'll try the back door right here. That's what I just did

1544
01:52:43,289 --> 01:52:45,289
So I was already one step ahead of you

1545
01:52:45,369 --> 01:52:58,750
I thought I was gonna elbow the glass

1546
01:53:12,460 --> 01:53:16,359
This game would be more immersive if like every three or four seconds he went

1547
01:53:19,420 --> 01:53:22,359
And there's no way to turn it off

1548
01:53:23,239 --> 01:53:30,970
Oh, here's another

1549
01:53:30,970 --> 01:53:33,550
family burnt to death

1550
01:53:33,550 --> 01:53:36,680
Well, I'm saying house fire deaths are suspicious

1551
01:53:38,270 --> 01:53:39,710
That's okay

1552
01:53:39,710 --> 01:53:52,829
You said I had to go back doctor. The fires are cathartic

1553
01:53:53,609 --> 01:53:58,010
They allow you to confront your past. You said the house would be empty

1554
01:53:58,649 --> 01:54:01,210
Are you taking the medication I have prescribed?

1555
01:54:02,220 --> 01:54:04,220
You said the house would be empty

1556
01:54:04,880 --> 01:54:06,880
I heard them screaming

1557
01:54:07,520 --> 01:54:09,520
Circumstances were unfortunate

1558
01:54:10,239 --> 01:54:14,399
My colleagues had made all the necessary arrangements the house would be empty

1559
01:54:15,119 --> 01:54:21,439
You're killing me the deaths were unfortunate but you have dealt with death before

1560
01:54:22,239 --> 01:54:26,270
I want you to come here. You said the house will be empty

1561
01:54:29,930 --> 01:54:37,869
No, that's the weirdest wrong number i've ever had

1562
01:54:48,159 --> 01:54:49,520
Okay

1563
01:54:49,520 --> 01:54:51,119
Let's search

1564
01:54:51,119 --> 01:54:57,850
Come on. Give me some clicks

1565
01:54:57,850 --> 01:55:02,989
Give me some clicks

1566
01:55:02,989 --> 01:55:06,109
Goggles it would take a smarter man than me to connect that. Oh

1567
01:55:10,239 --> 01:55:18,039
I heard a chime. I don't think that's right though

1568
01:55:18,840 --> 01:55:20,359
No, where?

1569
01:55:20,359 --> 01:55:24,989
They have all these audio cues in the game and then they play a bunch of other ones

1570
01:55:28,399 --> 01:55:32,489
This isn't what we're looking at. That's a key though. You can at least test to see where it goes to

1571
01:55:33,289 --> 01:55:35,319
fireplace

1572
01:55:35,319 --> 01:55:38,279
Mirror, uh, he's definitely filming somebody from the other side of this wall

1573
01:55:38,920 --> 01:55:46,350
All right, let's we're gonna go corner to corner here start on the front door

1574
01:55:47,069 --> 01:55:54,880
Burglar used the pry bar. Why did you kick the door in?

1575
01:55:55,520 --> 01:56:00,720
You think i'm gonna climb through a broken window in a 30 suit. You got another thing coming buster

1576
01:56:01,439 --> 01:56:03,039
He's that's true

1577
01:56:03,039 --> 01:56:07,739
Because as we all know with inflation, that's like five grand

1578
01:56:12,170 --> 01:56:14,170
Everybody drinks the same alcohol

1579
01:56:14,569 --> 01:56:26,569
Oh good to me

1580
01:56:26,569 --> 01:56:28,569
Yeah, like that's just one small complaint

1581
01:56:29,390 --> 01:56:32,909
Is like I wish like it's 30 bucks back then but like it's fucking 2006

1582
01:56:33,470 --> 01:56:37,470
Obviously having problems just make it like that what it would be actually if it cost it would be like, you know

1583
01:56:37,470 --> 01:56:39,550
1500 bucks is like a really expensive suit

1584
01:56:40,989 --> 01:56:48,779
Irritating, you know, give us something to go. She's over up. You can find me at apartment two

1585
01:56:48,779 --> 01:56:49,979
Two

1586
01:56:49,979 --> 01:56:51,840
Okay

1587
01:56:51,840 --> 01:56:55,600
No, one of my edges drank like this to be feeling the back of my hand

1588
01:56:56,159 --> 01:57:00,720
That's when the game came out in burglary and get technical services out here. I'll talk to the neighbors

1589
01:57:02,079 --> 01:57:05,119
Don't take all day. I thought it felt so I get nasty when i'm thirsty

1590
01:57:07,560 --> 01:57:12,600
nothing

1591
01:57:12,600 --> 01:57:15,079
Galloway homicide badge number five sixty four

1592
01:57:15,640 --> 01:57:20,439
Requesting technical services for a suspected 459 at 142 north union

1593
01:57:21,159 --> 01:57:28,439
No, it's not

1594
01:57:28,439 --> 01:57:32,140
Uh, hold on you gotta wait till you hear that

1595
01:57:33,340 --> 01:57:35,340
the little the little

1596
01:57:35,500 --> 01:57:37,760
twinkle

1597
01:57:37,760 --> 01:57:45,100
See the goggles were important a regular Amelia Earhart in her day. The ring looks distinctive

1598
01:57:46,920 --> 01:57:52,800
That's the ring

1599
01:57:52,800 --> 01:57:55,689
speaking of rings

1600
01:57:55,689 --> 01:57:57,289
This is a ring

1601
01:57:57,289 --> 01:58:00,890
Uh, well, actually, I don't know if this could be a couple of different things though

1602
01:58:02,539 --> 01:58:04,539
No, never mind. This is a seed container

1603
01:58:04,699 --> 01:58:09,340
First the stuff is junk. Why explain the missing ring? You can tell because of how deep it is

1604
01:58:19,229 --> 01:58:21,399
about this

1605
01:58:21,399 --> 01:58:24,090
Don't think this is any use to us

1606
01:58:24,729 --> 01:58:29,760
Okay, and that's it

1607
01:58:29,899 --> 01:58:31,899
Congratulations. Now I have to go to the neighbor

1608
01:58:32,399 --> 01:58:38,319
Is that as simple as walking next door? Do I have to drive there? Wait, what was that twinkle?

1609
01:58:40,539 --> 01:58:43,359
See

1610
01:58:43,359 --> 01:58:52,939
Now it's the newspaper. Never mind a pretentious streamer references himself only things still important to him. What the fuck

1611
01:58:54,159 --> 01:59:00,989
Which neighbor is it?

1612
01:59:00,989 --> 01:59:03,310
There's a bunch of neighbors this how this one

1613
01:59:04,350 --> 01:59:08,859
Oh, there's a neighbor

1614
01:59:08,859 --> 01:59:10,279
Hey

1615
01:59:10,279 --> 01:59:12,920
It wasn't safe around here anymore. Are you the neighbor?

1616
01:59:14,729 --> 01:59:15,850
I guess

1617
01:59:15,850 --> 01:59:19,449
LAPD, I guess you're the neighbor henry miss horgan

1618
01:59:19,989 --> 01:59:21,770
Jennifer horgan

1619
01:59:21,770 --> 01:59:24,970
I've known selene for more than 10 years our children grew up together

1620
01:59:25,850 --> 01:59:32,409
What's going on officer? Did you see mrs henry go out last night? Well, I'm no busybody you understand but

1621
01:59:33,770 --> 01:59:38,569
Selene had been drinking and she and poor long-suffering jacob had a terrible row

1622
01:59:39,529 --> 01:59:41,689
What's around jacob may have given her a black eye

1623
01:59:42,329 --> 01:59:45,850
He stormed out and she went back inside. Did he come back? No

1624
01:59:46,569 --> 01:59:50,329
Selene was listening to music and shouting until she left around 10 pm

1625
01:59:50,970 --> 01:59:53,130
She was very drunk to have been driving

1626
01:59:53,609 --> 01:59:57,529
But she is not the sort of person you can stop from doing something when her dander is up

1627
01:59:58,010 --> 02:00:00,890
It was my hat. What is this about officer? Is selene all right?

1628
02:00:01,369 --> 02:00:03,609
I'm afraid mrs henry has been murdered ma'am

1629
02:00:04,470 --> 02:00:07,020
murdered

1630
02:00:07,020 --> 02:00:08,779
Oh my god

1631
02:00:08,779 --> 02:00:12,960
I'm afraid I need to go and then sit down

1632
02:00:13,760 --> 02:00:21,880
All right, make sure you lock your door too because the murderer said he was coming here to kill you next

1633
02:00:22,600 --> 02:00:24,600
Imagine you imagine there was an option

1634
02:00:24,600 --> 02:00:38,750
Have a good day. Let's see what jacob has to say for himself. I don't think jacob is our man

1635
02:00:38,750 --> 02:00:40,750
But we should see what he has to say

1636
02:00:43,289 --> 02:00:48,970
How do you start using these I have these free points

1637
02:00:49,850 --> 02:00:59,199
Jacob henry the husband strange husband jacob henry had a violent argument with his wife last night

1638
02:00:59,439 --> 02:01:01,439
He's looking more likely row

1639
02:01:02,720 --> 02:01:05,600
The rod keeps the house looking like that's probably deserved

1640
02:01:06,640 --> 02:01:11,760
The skipper says bring him in keep the hatchet back for a while fine by me hidden object

1641
02:01:11,760 --> 02:01:16,319
So it ain't the werewolf killer after all to every opening from mission impossible movies

1642
02:01:16,479 --> 02:01:18,319
I always said work the evidence

1643
02:01:18,319 --> 02:01:22,560
I only stipulated a connection to the bd killer as an avenue of investigation

1644
02:01:22,560 --> 02:01:25,520
We should leave open and as far as i'm concerned it still is

1645
02:01:26,239 --> 02:01:35,069
And then eventually this is gonna go

1646
02:01:36,510 --> 02:01:44,380
It's gonna be an elaborate intro

1647
02:01:56,159 --> 02:01:57,840
Just get out of the car

1648
02:01:57,840 --> 02:02:00,319
Climb over the fence like a real gamer

1649
02:02:05,800 --> 02:02:08,119
You but you can handle that one, but you can't handle this one

1650
02:02:12,220 --> 02:02:13,420
Whoa?

1651
02:02:13,420 --> 02:02:15,260

It was a sickness with her

1718
02:09:11,760 --> 02:09:13,760
Doesn't mean I didn't love her

1719
02:09:15,039 --> 02:09:17,279
Would you stop loving your wife if she was unwell?

1720
02:09:18,539 --> 02:09:21,850

02:09:33,680 --> 02:09:35,680
That's a lousy thing to say

1724
02:09:36,319 --> 02:09:38,699
I never

1725
02:09:38,699 --> 02:09:46,560

So what did he did the fucking mystery ink? I don't believe you jacob

1728
02:10:03,609 --> 02:10:06,970
I think you didn't have the guts to do it yourself. Did you write it?

1729
02:10:07,609 --> 02:10:09,609
You want to back that up with something big mouth?

1730
02:10:10,170 --> 02:10:13,289
Huh? Yeah, I have a mystery ink here

Impression from no written by jacob henry concerning wife there it is get done the note by the phone suggests you meant her harm

1732
02:10:23,050 --> 02:10:25,130
You want the truth?

1733
02:10:25,130 --> 02:10:27,689
truth is I was sick to death of her

1734
02:10:29,239 --> 02:10:30,760
I was

1735
02:10:30,760 --> 02:10:33,050
Trying to have her committed

1736
02:10:33,050 --> 02:10:35,289
We're still going to need you to come downtown. Mr. Henry

1737
02:10:35,930 --> 02:10:41,050
How many points we get this all down on paper jacob how you got fed up with your wife and how you figured killing her

1738
02:10:41,130 --> 02:10:43,130
Would bury all your troubles

1739
02:10:43,449 --> 02:10:44,890
Kill my own wife

1740
02:10:44,890 --> 02:10:49,609
She was a loss of the trap and you just couldn't stand it anymore shut your goddamn mouth

02:10:50,489 --> 02:10:55,609
So now you're gonna tell me you loved her. Ah, the da goes all gooey over remorse jacob

1742
02:10:56,729 --> 02:10:58,729
Now you assaulted him. Okay, here we go

1743
02:10:59,850 --> 02:11:03,850
Here's the problem, but I haven't played in a long time. I forget how to punch. How do you punch is it r2?

1744
02:11:04,329 --> 02:11:05,930

I haven't done this in like a month. What's punch? What's this?

Yes, ma'am

1765
02:12:36,140 --> 02:12:44,430
Carruthers, it's felps completed the autopsy several wounds to the head from a blunt metal instrument wounds

1766
02:12:44,510 --> 02:12:46,670
Closest match would be a socket wrench handle

1767
02:12:47,529 --> 02:12:57,789
So the cause of death was the blunt no the blast was from hemorrhage and shock from the fractured ribs and multiple injuries caused by the stomping

1768
02:12:58,600 --> 02:13:00,359
Anything else?

1769

02:13:47,000 --> 02:13:49,000
Got it. We're coming in. Um

1782
02:13:49,560 --> 02:13:55,640
This is great. Let me tell you something. You know when you had a school project where you had to have like a an older female voice

1783
02:13:56,520 --> 02:14:00,520
If you're making like a video with your friends or something and you have like your mother do a recording

1784
02:14:01,319 --> 02:14:05,000
Anybody else do that? Like that was like your mom helping you do like the english video project

1785
02:14:07,319 --> 02:14:09,640
Did anybody ever do like a video project for like school?

1786
02:14:11,149 --> 02:14:16,810
None of you did

1787
02:14:16,810 --> 02:14:20,010
Or like for like a play or something you need to like an older woman's voice

1788
02:14:20,329 --> 02:14:23,930
And that was like one of the teachers which is record like a sentence for you guys. No one did that

1789
02:14:24,329 --> 02:14:27,149
Nice fucking kids these days

1790
02:14:28,439 --> 02:14:32,760
Didn't even record your mother like saying weird sentences for like your school project

1791
02:14:39,560 --> 02:14:41,560
All right, where are we going?

1792
02:14:43,420 --> 02:14:46,279
here

1793
02:14:46,279 --> 02:14:47,960
Alonzo mendez

1794
02:14:47,960 --> 02:14:52,920
Sound like a man who moonlights as the werewolf don't sound like a man. I'd let my daughter anywhere in here

1795
02:14:53,239 --> 02:14:55,960
You've got a daughter spend enough time drink. How old are you?

1796
02:14:56,680 --> 02:14:58,680
You guys know how old I am easy

1797
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:03,439
Kids these days

1798
02:15:03,439 --> 02:15:09,550
It's been enough time drinking call you'll find yourself with any number of things you don't want. Nope, you just he cut me off

1799
02:15:09,550 --> 02:15:11,550
That's why you never sold it

1800
02:15:11,770 --> 02:15:14,699
Exactly

1801
02:15:14,699 --> 02:15:17,500
Do you have the vaude of your mother doing that? No

1802
02:15:18,300 --> 02:15:25,020
I use a pay phone guys. I used to call my parents collect because I got detention

1803
02:15:26,300 --> 02:15:32,220
I needed to tell them that they had to come and get me later. They know exactly what they're gonna get

1804
02:15:33,340 --> 02:15:50,140
This is the apartment

1805
02:15:50,140 --> 02:15:52,380
Wait, why was it? I got a little twinkle here. Hold on

1806
02:15:54,140 --> 02:15:56,720
16 mendez apartment 16

1807
02:15:59,560 --> 02:16:01,560
Why was I a bad kid?

1808
02:16:01,640 --> 02:16:06,239
I mean bad kid

1809
02:16:06,319 --> 02:16:09,760
Detention didn't mean you were a bad kid detention means that you had a teacher

1810
02:16:10,800 --> 02:16:18,000
That didn't like the fact that you would take your shnakers off in class and juggle them while they were trying to do a lesson

1811
02:16:18,479 --> 02:16:19,760
You know like

1812
02:16:19,760 --> 02:16:29,449
shut up teacher

1813
02:16:29,449 --> 02:16:31,449
Here the apartment's up on the top floor

1814
02:16:31,609 --> 02:16:41,500
I mean, it's not like one time I hid it in the closet in my history class

1815
02:16:44,200 --> 02:16:49,079
And stayed in there for probably five full minutes while the teacher was starting the class

1816
02:16:51,079 --> 02:16:53,559
And then I just fucking burst it out and fell down on the floor

1817
02:16:56,000 --> 02:17:01,280
That actually happened. All right, where are we going?

1818
02:17:04,170 --> 02:17:15,299
16 no elevator here

1819
02:17:15,719 --> 02:17:24,409
You just kick the door in

1820
02:17:24,409 --> 02:17:26,409
Oh, I've always wanted to do that

1821
02:17:27,719 --> 02:17:30,040
Oh more notepad stuff any more invisible ink

1822
02:17:32,809 --> 02:17:35,770
Elevators didn't exist in these times. Yes, they did. I just took them on

1823
02:17:37,920 --> 02:17:56,540
Don't lie to the streamer. Don't lie to me. I doubt it. It looked like anything

1824
02:17:59,610 --> 02:18:11,129
gee

1825
02:18:12,250 --> 02:18:15,870
Somebody said fear fear

1826
02:18:24,600 --> 02:18:30,200
Fear fuck cursive, man, probably nothing

1827
02:18:33,209 --> 02:18:40,860
What else is in your

1828
02:18:40,940 --> 02:18:42,379
record player

1829
02:18:42,379 --> 02:18:48,040
Books. Oh, wait, i'm not done with this. That's the only door i'm allowed to kick down, isn't it?

1830
02:18:48,600 --> 02:18:55,049
What does it want me to do cigarettes?

1831
02:19:02,479 --> 02:19:04,000
Did I miss anything else?

1832
02:19:04,000 --> 02:19:07,680
What about over here?

1833
02:19:07,680 --> 02:19:09,040
and uh

1834
02:19:09,040 --> 02:19:11,120
What is this weird? What's about this weird room?

1835
02:19:11,840 --> 02:19:15,719
This apartment is very strange

1836
02:19:15,719 --> 02:19:18,920
This is a weird apartment man that like the apartments aren't like this

1837
02:19:19,719 --> 02:19:25,399
Okay, so we have

1838
02:19:25,399 --> 02:19:28,239
the clothes on the ground

1839
02:19:28,239 --> 02:19:30,409
got a dresser

1840
02:19:31,500 --> 02:19:33,500
and then a painting set

1841
02:19:33,579 --> 02:19:36,079
None of that looks important

1842
02:19:36,079 --> 02:19:37,440
um

1843
02:19:37,440 --> 02:19:38,719
A toy

1844
02:19:38,719 --> 02:19:44,540
No, this is room's clean

1845
02:19:44,540 --> 02:19:46,889
a shoe

1846
02:19:46,889 --> 02:19:51,610
We got him how to get these to ray size eight could help place mendez at the scene this dad

1847
02:19:51,610 --> 02:19:53,129
This dude was there

1848
02:19:53,129 --> 02:19:56,729
Found the killer don't even need egg. I got this. This is like the feet crime

1849
02:19:57,750 --> 02:20:08,280
Insistent with selene's injuries and the blood can be typed

1850
02:20:14,250 --> 02:20:22,299
And this looks like some lipstick doesn't it same one same brand brothers could match the color and brand of the body

1851
02:20:22,860 --> 02:20:36,239
We have the murder weapon better get pinker down here. Why keep it? Why not throw it away?

1852
02:20:36,319 --> 02:20:38,319
I think these clowns are geniuses

1853
02:20:38,479 --> 02:20:41,920
Thank your stars. You caught a break captain donald begin to like you

1854
02:20:43,280 --> 02:20:46,639

I just need to look at your feet. That's all I need to do

1858
02:21:00,559 --> 02:21:11,799
Can I dark souls him? You don't need to do this alonzo

1859
02:21:12,520 --> 02:21:31,000
Ow, he's gonna get away

1860
02:21:36,079 --> 02:21:38,959
No, don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it. I had an opportunity and I did see

1861
02:21:43,799 --> 02:21:46,040
I could have driven driven right into the gas station

1862
02:21:46,680 --> 02:22:03,370
But I didn't where you going, man. I got an idea

1863
02:22:04,090 --> 02:22:09,049
Get him next to my window call keep me alongside his vehicle and i'll stop the son of a bitch

1864
02:22:10,409 --> 02:22:11,610
Okay

1865
02:22:11,610 --> 02:22:19,360
Hit him cold spin him out

1866
02:22:20,030 --> 02:22:21,610
Come on

1867
02:22:21,610 --> 02:22:22,729
Get it

1868
02:22:22,729 --> 02:22:26,809
Got it. I'm trying to shoot out his tires. All right. Well, well now what do we do?

1869
02:22:27,290 --> 02:22:29,610
No, he's he's he's in there get him out of there. What?

1870
02:22:31,469 --> 02:22:35,629
Get him out. You don't need to shoot his tires anymore. This thing's gonna blow up

1871
02:22:44,889 --> 02:22:48,090
That is that it did I beat him? Did I win?

1872
02:22:48,649 --> 02:23:00,620
I ain't saying a goddamn thing

1873
02:23:05,450 --> 02:23:07,370
and justice

1874
02:23:07,370 --> 02:23:10,719
Has been served

1875
02:23:10,719 --> 02:23:12,719
You did a grand job lads

1876
02:23:13,280 --> 02:23:14,559
folks

1877
02:23:14,559 --> 02:23:18,719
That's quite a way to acquit yourself in your first outing as a homicide investigator

1878
02:23:19,520 --> 02:23:22,319
It seems this city has a new and vengeful guardian

1879
02:23:23,520 --> 02:23:28,239
Considering the evidence against your suspect my feet do all the talking with which a report was compiled

1880
02:23:28,319 --> 02:23:32,159
I foresee a safe passage through the courts and the d.a agrees with me

1881
02:23:33,479 --> 02:23:36,399
Brutality on a scale such as this deserves retribution

1882
02:23:37,500 --> 02:23:38,860
the people

1883
02:23:38,860 --> 02:23:47,760
And the press of this city demanded I didn't oh, that was awkward

1884
02:23:50,190 --> 02:23:51,790
I did all the work though

1885
02:23:51,790 --> 02:23:58,139
So how was our report there 18 and uh, that was

1886
02:23:59,020 --> 02:24:04,299
Come on that's pretty good. That's close enough 18 out of 19 5 out of 6. I got one question wrong

1887
02:24:07,950 --> 02:24:13,389
I'm never gonna make any money though

1888
02:24:13,930 --> 02:24:16,190
5,000 that's like it's like

1889
02:24:17,799 --> 02:24:20,760
That's like what 50 60 70 thousand dollars

1890
02:24:22,350 --> 02:24:26,879
Do I have to make any money?

1891
02:24:26,879 --> 02:24:29,079
That's only a b

1892
02:24:29,079 --> 02:24:42,270
That's what that's fine

1893
02:24:53,690 --> 02:24:58,239
Thirsty

1894
02:25:09,500 --> 02:25:32,280
It is the golden butterfly the game is fun it's always a guy with a club

1895
02:25:38,030 --> 02:25:42,510
Galloway got it skipper

1896
02:25:44,989 --> 02:25:48,190
I think this is the nudity mission. Oh that we already saw the nudity mission

1897
02:25:49,159 --> 02:25:51,639
Unless there's a nudity mission after the nudity mission

1898
02:25:52,520 --> 02:25:58,200
New case in which case male dumped in plain sight in the grass at the end of hill street hacks are all over it

1899
02:25:58,680 --> 02:26:01,719
Captains trying to fend them off that sounds awfully similar

1900
02:26:02,520 --> 02:26:06,360
The first rule of police work is make no assumptions until you've seen the evidence wait

1901
02:26:06,440 --> 02:26:09,559
Are we breaking open like a serial killer case where so, okay

1902
02:26:09,639 --> 02:26:11,959
Hold on a minute here. I think we're getting to the meat and potatoes

1903
02:26:11,959 --> 02:26:16,680
I think I know the place where they found the lady it overlooks somebody's a serial killer. Let's go

1904
02:26:18,750 --> 02:26:24,350
All right. Oh, give me a second. Give me uh, let me just grab um, i'm like i'm craving something. You know what I mean?

1905
02:26:24,989 --> 02:26:26,350
I'll be right back

1906
02:26:26,350 --> 02:26:30,030
Give me like uh, give me like i'm gonna like blend up some fruits. Okay

1907
02:26:30,590 --> 02:26:36,649
I'll be back in like 40 minutes. I'm just kidding. Don't I me just saying that probably made everybody leave i'm back in two minutes

1908
02:26:37,290 --> 02:30:59,360
All right beer back. All right

1909
02:31:01,069 --> 02:31:03,069
I'm sorry. I had to make something

1910
02:31:07,000 --> 02:31:09,000
This one's even this one's even

1911
02:31:09,319 --> 02:31:12,319
see

1912
02:31:12,319 --> 02:31:15,280
Well, okay, that looks really fucking gross in this tiny camera

1913
02:31:15,840 --> 02:31:18,459
That looks like a blood-stained windshield

1914
02:31:19,100 --> 02:31:26,440
All right. Hold on. It's fruits. It's blueberries

1915
02:31:27,059 --> 02:31:29,059
blackberries raspberries

1916
02:31:29,469 --> 02:31:30,989
It's fruits guys

1917
02:31:30,989 --> 02:31:36,040
And it gets like stuck in your teeth. It's the worst

1918
02:31:37,129 --> 02:31:41,450
Anyways, I don't have cameras on because I don't do cam. I don't do it

1919
02:31:43,100 --> 02:31:45,309
You understand?

1920
02:31:45,309 --> 02:31:47,309
Guys, I don't do cam

1921
02:31:54,430 --> 02:31:56,430
I thought that was a close-up of a tortilla

1922
02:31:56,829 --> 02:31:58,829
No, that was my face

1923
02:31:58,829 --> 02:32:00,829
That was my face

1924
02:32:00,829 --> 02:32:02,809
Yeah

1925
02:32:02,809 --> 02:32:04,809
Yeah, yeah

1926
02:32:06,829 --> 02:32:08,829
He's so insecure. No, I don't like

1927
02:32:10,110 --> 02:32:13,950
I don't like this. Let me look. I don't like this

1928
02:32:14,750 --> 02:32:24,760
The reason why I don't like face cam is because like i'm it's i'm just like here

1929
02:32:25,739 --> 02:32:28,139
Just sitting here people just looking at my face

1930
02:32:29,020 --> 02:32:40,139
You did a decent job in the henry case felps not bad for your first time. Just in case you're curious. I'm still here

1931
02:32:40,780 --> 02:32:44,700
Don't go getting ahead of yourself. That's one clearance under your belt

1932
02:32:45,180 --> 02:32:48,379
Now it's a new day with a new dead lady that needs our attention

1933
02:32:48,940 --> 02:32:51,260
No assumptions until we see the evidence, right?

1934
02:32:51,899 --> 02:32:57,579
Right, I sure am adding a lot to this video footage here might get long after all

1935
02:33:06,219 --> 02:33:13,639
Phelps d what d what?

1936
02:33:15,000 --> 02:33:20,139
Where are we supposed to go up top? Okay, I fucked it up. You have to react more

1937
02:33:21,319 --> 02:33:27,680
Okay

1938
02:33:27,680 --> 02:33:50,440
Jesus felps, where am I fucking going? I have to go up get back in the car. I've got to go up and then right

1939
02:34:02,840 --> 02:34:07,440
Give us more reactions calm down

1940
02:34:07,920 --> 02:34:10,340
Reaction i'll give you a reaction

1941
02:34:11,360 --> 02:34:15,260
Oh boys boys, you know as much as I do

1942
02:34:16,059 --> 02:34:19,260
I'll be holding a press conference once the autopsy is being completed

1943
02:34:21,659 --> 02:34:24,540
I have two of my finest investigators on the case

1944
02:34:25,260 --> 02:34:33,500
Fresh from bringing down the sword of justice on the crazed sex captain aren't there similarities between this murder and the murder of selene henry?

1945
02:34:33,659 --> 02:34:38,219
Yeah, here's the big one elizabeth short for that matter. You don't believe there's a crazed sex killer at large

1946
02:34:38,860 --> 02:34:40,860
Women boys be sensible

1947
02:34:41,340 --> 02:34:45,500
We have the greatest police force in the world with the greatest guy. He's the serial killer

1948
02:34:46,620 --> 02:34:49,739
All right, let's play red dead. I figured it out. How can any killer continue to be that?

1949
02:34:50,620 --> 02:34:52,920
be advised

1950
02:34:52,920 --> 02:34:59,319
We keep the gas chamber at san quentin primed for the sons of king who continue to believe they can take a life in the city

1951
02:34:59,319 --> 02:35:03,159
Of angels. Yeah, right any new leads in the dahlia case

1952
02:35:04,920 --> 02:35:07,319
Run along boys and let these officers get to work

1953
02:35:08,200 --> 02:35:13,159
We have god's work. I'm still having fun playing this one. Why would I change games when I was liking and playing this one?

1954
02:35:13,159 --> 02:35:15,719
What do we have captain?

1955
02:35:15,719 --> 02:35:20,360
I got the same body type as him that same side like stomach profiles. I know what it's like

1956
02:35:30,000 --> 02:35:32,500
You know, you know what you have the same stomach profile

1957
02:35:34,170 --> 02:35:36,010
You were first on scene you

1958
02:35:36,010 --> 02:35:39,049
So what happened shows over keep moving all of you?

1959
02:35:39,850 --> 02:35:41,850
Who was first on scene? Which one of you?

1960
02:35:42,750 --> 02:35:44,780
You

1961
02:35:44,780 --> 02:35:46,430
What did you do?

1962
02:35:46,430 --> 02:35:49,629
What happened here?

1963
02:35:49,629 --> 02:35:51,930
Who did it? Why is there a blip here?

1964
02:35:52,489 --> 02:35:55,739
What do you want me to make sure the evidence gets back? What do you think sir?

1965
02:35:56,219 --> 02:36:05,290
Oh, god damn it. It's another fucking naked body

1966
02:36:06,170 --> 02:36:11,870
Is it like a guy?

1967
02:36:11,870 --> 02:36:17,950
Similar remote what the dahlia shit? I don't think so. Celine henry. That's a closed case

1968
02:36:18,590 --> 02:36:23,229
This is probably another sad sack who lost his temper with the proud. Is it naked bodies from here on out?

1969
02:36:23,950 --> 02:36:25,950
Watch your mouth though

1970
02:36:25,950 --> 02:36:32,750
All i'm saying is we got enough to do without reopening closed cases. Talk me through it now severely battered on display

1971
02:36:33,389 --> 02:36:35,549
Footprints would indicate that she has been stomped

1972
02:36:36,110 --> 02:36:41,069
Size of the footprints would seem to indicate a smallish men's shoe. What's a shoe did mendez wear?

1973
02:36:41,790 --> 02:36:43,790
You finished no, i'm not

1974
02:36:44,030 --> 02:36:48,909
At a glance, I would say strangulation is the cause of death. I need to do further tests for semen

1975
02:36:50,110 --> 02:36:54,750
Angry boyfriend they were married. They'd be at home not humping out here in lovers lane

1976
02:36:55,549 --> 02:36:57,629
You mind if I examine the body you might guess

1977
02:36:58,510 --> 02:37:10,409
Okay, whatever up

1978
02:37:10,409 --> 02:37:12,649
Look at your mark is very distinctive

1979
02:37:13,530 --> 02:37:16,170
I'll do some comparisons back to the lab and get back to you

1980
02:37:20,809 --> 02:37:26,110
She's looking around for like a car or something. This is fucked up. It looks like she was tied up

1981
02:37:27,309 --> 02:37:32,510
Does it first but that would leave a mark on her other wrist too. Let's check out her watch might have been torn off

1982
02:37:39,149 --> 02:37:42,219
No wrong. No, no

1983
02:37:42,219 --> 02:37:47,879
Quick quick quick quick quick. I don't want to be here any longer than I have to what's this another wedding ring finger

1984
02:37:48,760 --> 02:37:50,760
fourth finger left hand

1985
02:37:50,840 --> 02:37:54,920
wedding or engagement ring violently removed this is the same thing as the other one

1986
02:37:57,079 --> 02:37:59,079
Am I like in bizarro land? Are we doing the same one?

1987
02:37:59,959 --> 02:38:08,139
The stopping angle in the henry case was it reported in the press small men's footprint was

1988
02:38:08,780 --> 02:38:11,500
Every detail a copycat would want was there in the story

1989
02:38:12,540 --> 02:38:13,959
Okay

1990
02:38:13,959 --> 02:38:18,719
I think that's it

1991
02:38:18,719 --> 02:38:24,409
Anything else

1992
02:38:28,489 --> 02:38:31,559
Oh emote only mode

1993
02:38:31,639 --> 02:38:33,079
Emotes only

1994
02:38:33,079 --> 02:38:40,299
Okay, there's so many seeds in this

1995
02:38:40,860 --> 02:38:43,920
Oh, we have a name. Can you run deirdre muller by rni?

1996
02:38:44,239 --> 02:38:48,159
No, I don't like a second raspberries and blackberries. It's just full of seeds

1997
02:38:49,200 --> 02:38:53,280
And then it's like you're just drinking popcorn kernels. I need to strain this shit

1998
02:38:53,840 --> 02:39:10,489
I did money the motive was robbery. Why not take the money? That's it in here, right got a name

1999
02:39:11,819 --> 02:39:14,409
cash

2000
02:39:14,409 --> 02:39:21,530
Detectives rni says that deirdre muller of 130 north bonnie bray was reported missing this morning by her husband hugo muller

2001
02:39:22,569 --> 02:39:27,690
Maybe that's it grab the husband take him downtown and work him over and have this wrapped up

2002
02:39:28,969 --> 02:39:31,610
What about not making assumptions and going on the evidence?

2003
02:39:32,569 --> 02:39:33,850
Here we go

2004
02:39:33,850 --> 02:39:35,049
small feet

2005
02:39:35,049 --> 02:39:41,930
Okay

2006
02:39:41,930 --> 02:39:50,139
How's that? It's not it's good. So it can't be mendez because mendez had size eight

2007
02:39:50,379 --> 02:39:51,579
Feet

2008
02:39:51,579 --> 02:40:00,200
It's time to bring it up line up

2009
02:40:00,280 --> 02:40:16,559
only feet though

2010
02:40:16,559 --> 02:40:21,520
All right, so we're gonna go to the mall of residence residential address of murder victim muller

2011
02:40:22,239 --> 02:40:35,870
I got my small feet all over the crime scene

2012
02:40:47,360 --> 02:40:50,959
I thought you were on our way to lock up the husband if it doesn't work out that

2013
02:40:51,440 --> 02:40:53,440
Deirdre muller has suffered enough

2014
02:40:53,440 --> 02:40:55,440
More than enough

2015
02:41:00,090 --> 02:41:07,340
Cole she was a woman wasn't she?

2016
02:41:08,219 --> 02:41:13,020
Around about my third divorce. I realized women might not be the pure angels we imagined

2017
02:41:13,579 --> 02:41:17,500
They're married ain't you felt don't make any insinuation. She's not trying to get in the car

2018
02:41:18,139 --> 02:41:21,180
Hey, it's a woman. She's the mother of my children

2019
02:41:22,139 --> 02:41:27,739
You're a father cool, but don't tell me your eye don't bend this conversation is over

2020
02:41:29,479 --> 02:41:31,000
I can't

2021
02:41:31,000 --> 02:41:34,040
There's nowhere to go. I fucked this whole thing up. I could go this way

2022
02:41:36,520 --> 02:41:38,520
Why don't you drive a car down here?

2023
02:41:38,760 --> 02:41:43,639
Is there a jump I can go up to get out? There we go out

2024
02:41:48,280 --> 02:41:49,879
That was a shortcut too

2025
02:41:49,879 --> 02:41:56,989
Slow and steady. Come on

2026
02:41:58,510 --> 02:42:00,510
Okay, what kind of music do we have this time?

2027
02:42:01,610 --> 02:42:03,930
No, I know what we've got. We've got the romantic comedy

2028
02:42:04,010 --> 02:42:09,850
The love interest shows up in the bar where the two comedy guys are hanging out and it's slow motion zooms in

2029
02:42:10,649 --> 02:42:12,649
to her walking around and

2030
02:42:12,649 --> 02:42:14,649
Potentially looking in our direction

2031
02:42:14,969 --> 02:42:30,909
Eat your berry puree

2032
02:42:31,149 --> 02:42:34,829
Yeah, I will enjoy my baby food. Thank you very much

2033
02:42:35,790 --> 02:42:41,319
Give me a fucking vehicle damage. I can't help it

2034
02:42:49,149 --> 02:42:54,989
No, Jeremy. This is a different. No, this is I I want it to be the the romantic comedy love interest scene

2035
02:42:55,870 --> 02:42:58,649
Whatever your version in your head is fine

2036
02:43:08,219 --> 02:43:11,020
Had to skip the red dead streams glad you're back. Hey, it's good to be back

2037
02:43:12,059 --> 02:43:13,659
I do uh

2038
02:43:13,659 --> 02:43:20,139
I do understand that red dead is brand new game and along a lot of people you're driving you maniac must play lists

2039
02:43:20,219 --> 02:43:24,700
And I don't expect people to sit there the whole time. So welcome back. Thank you

2040
02:43:26,139 --> 02:43:40,409
It was gone for a day. Well that well that person was saying that they didn't watch my red dead streams

2041
02:43:41,129 --> 02:43:43,450
Because they didn't want to get spoiled and I completely understand

2042
02:43:44,889 --> 02:43:46,889
Hope you enjoy the game when you play it

2043
02:43:47,209 --> 02:44:06,329
I didn't watch the red dead streams because they suck phelps and galloway la pd

2044
02:44:07,290 --> 02:44:09,290
Is that's what are you?

2045
02:44:09,690 --> 02:44:15,610
That this was so much fun. What are you talking about? What's your name? I had so much fun on those streams. Oh, he's smaller

2046
02:44:16,989 --> 02:44:20,190
Can we come in? What kind of baby food are you drinking right now?

2047
02:44:22,860 --> 02:44:25,229
Thank you

2048
02:44:25,229 --> 02:44:27,229
Could you have a seat for me michelle?

2049
02:44:28,319 --> 02:44:39,069
We're gonna have a look around

2050
02:44:39,069 --> 02:44:41,069
He's getting high on baby food

2051
02:44:46,299 --> 02:44:48,299
Why do I always read the worst feedback?

2052
02:44:50,479 --> 02:44:52,479
Because that's that's just the cookies

2053
02:44:52,639 --> 02:44:53,840
Oh

2054
02:44:53,840 --> 02:44:56,959
Cookies, how about what was it? What was the joke? Come on. What was it?

2055
02:45:01,120 --> 02:45:06,239
I forget. I don't remember something about a restaurant. There's something about ordering from the special and then it was a cookies or something

2056
02:45:06,239 --> 02:45:09,639
What was it?

2057
02:45:09,639 --> 02:45:18,670
I don't know. It's a cabinet

2058
02:45:18,909 --> 02:45:21,600
We got uh, we got a

2059
02:45:21,600 --> 02:45:23,600
We've got a cabinet and we also have

2060
02:45:24,319 --> 02:45:25,840
I won't put down that

2061
02:45:25,840 --> 02:45:32,510
lemon

2062
02:45:32,510 --> 02:45:37,309
Cabot I can do that better. There's a lemon on the table. There's also a cabinet

2063
02:45:38,110 --> 02:45:39,870
I can't do it anymore

2064
02:45:39,870 --> 02:45:44,079
Too old i'm trying to have my jaw like snap up

2065
02:45:45,450 --> 02:45:57,680
This isn't what we're looking at. I got a mouthful of baby food. Whatever turn on the webcam. Why that's why it's not on

2066
02:46:00,079 --> 02:46:02,079
Half of these things are so fucking embarrassing

2067
02:46:03,049 --> 02:46:05,049
Times 10 if the webcam was on

2068
02:46:05,450 --> 02:46:07,450
Don't forget somebody's birthday

2069
02:46:07,450 --> 02:46:13,479
But I told you I would be doing this shit. I'd be saying like

2070
02:46:14,440 --> 02:46:25,149
Cabot if the stream was off. I'll give you a real story here. So after I watched infinity war, uh

2071
02:46:25,950 --> 02:46:27,549
Me and kim watched it

2072
02:46:27,629 --> 02:46:29,629
And I didn't even know I had no idea

2073
02:46:30,190 --> 02:46:32,190
Uh kim walked in

2074
02:46:32,270 --> 02:46:36,030
I was just sitting there on the computer and she's like, will you please stop?

2075
02:46:36,590 --> 02:46:38,989
I was like, what are you? What are you talking about? What do you mean? Please stop?

2076
02:46:39,149 --> 02:46:43,709
She's like you keep saying the same line from her body and I was just sitting up here going

2077
02:46:43,950 --> 02:46:45,950
I know what it's like to lose

2078
02:46:46,719 --> 02:46:48,719
To know so desperately that you're right

2079
02:46:49,520 --> 02:46:51,520
Like I was doing it like over and over again

2080
02:46:52,559 --> 02:47:04,110
I was just doing it. We're getting a couple of seed boxes. No sign of a wedding ring

2081
02:47:04,989 --> 02:47:08,989
So everyone everyone that thinks me saying like oh cabbage is like no I I would be doing that

2082
02:47:10,040 --> 02:47:14,219
In fact, I would be doing it like 15 times more if I wasn't on camera

2083
02:47:19,100 --> 02:47:22,299
It's actually keeping me in check being like recorded

2084
02:47:24,000 --> 02:47:29,739
feet

2085
02:47:29,739 --> 02:47:31,739
Oh, these are only size eights

2086
02:47:32,059 --> 02:47:33,420
Size eights

2087
02:47:33,420 --> 02:47:43,659
Oh, yes, the killer did have feet

2088
02:47:47,819 --> 02:47:49,819
Well, because why are we looking for like

2089
02:47:49,899 --> 02:47:54,889
Well, no, we're looking for smaller

2090
02:47:55,129 --> 02:47:56,729
Cookies cabbage

2091
02:47:56,729 --> 02:48:03,530
Is this about mommy

2092
02:48:03,530 --> 02:48:05,530
Daddy is trying to find her

2093
02:48:05,530 --> 02:48:10,090
Please tell me she's okay. Oh, this is not good. I'm sorry to have to tell you this michelle, but

2094
02:48:11,290 --> 02:48:14,809
Your mother is dead

2095
02:48:18,639 --> 02:48:22,719
Do you think you could answer a few questions for us try

2096
02:48:26,040 --> 02:48:28,040
Oh shit, okay. Hold on

2097
02:48:28,200 --> 02:48:30,840
This is the daughter is like this is

2098
02:48:30,840 --> 02:48:36,780
I gotta be careful because she put on some of your mother's jewelry was missing. Can you describe her things?

2099
02:48:37,500 --> 02:48:39,360
ring

2100
02:48:39,360 --> 02:48:45,879
But why would she know those I never paid much attention to that stuff. Well, she she would she would just know that right?

2101
02:48:46,680 --> 02:48:51,180
When you would I mean I just I just asked her

2102
02:48:52,620 --> 02:48:57,100
I just asked her for michelle. I'm not gonna bad copper. She's a kid. She wore a wedding ring

2103
02:48:57,579 --> 02:48:59,579
Let me chose it herself

2104
02:48:59,739 --> 02:49:04,649
Rose gold wedding band and the matching diamond and ruby engagement ring

2105
02:49:05,290 --> 02:49:06,889
She wore a watch

2106
02:49:06,889 --> 02:49:07,850
Yes

2107
02:49:07,850 --> 02:49:09,850
the yellow gold elgin watch

2108
02:49:10,250 --> 02:49:12,250
Daddy bought it for her birthday

2109
02:49:12,569 --> 02:49:17,879
It was kind of a makeup present

2110
02:49:18,440 --> 02:49:23,690
Okay, last contact. Let me hold away. Let me see this shit first. I don't want to fuck this up

2111
02:49:25,120 --> 02:49:27,520
All right. There's a rope on the lady's neck

2112
02:49:28,159 --> 02:49:32,000
Missing watch and ring so they both she that maybe she took them. I don't know

2113
02:49:33,280 --> 02:49:38,159
Small men are we sure that's a small men's footprint and not like a small woman's footprint

2114
02:49:39,079 --> 02:49:41,079
Do we know the make and bottle of that shoe?

2115
02:49:47,709 --> 02:49:52,190
I don't really have much to go on. So when did you last see your mother yesterday afternoon?

2116
02:49:53,069 --> 02:49:55,559
I went to a dance at Belmont high

2117
02:49:56,600 --> 02:50:02,190
I was supposed to pick me up, but she didn't show so what did you do then? I was upset

2118
02:50:04,620 --> 02:50:11,079
Daddy came instead

2119
02:50:11,079 --> 02:50:13,479
Okay. Well now why would she be lying about this?

2120
02:50:14,520 --> 02:50:22,139
Do I have anything?

2121
02:50:22,139 --> 02:50:24,139
And did he come and get you?

2122
02:50:24,909 --> 02:50:26,799
of course

2123
02:50:26,799 --> 02:50:30,319
Some boys offered me a ride home, but I don't I don't sense a why here

2124
02:50:30,399 --> 02:50:32,399
So you were hanging around the school for quite a while

2125
02:50:33,200 --> 02:50:35,440
What happened with your father? I don't know

2126
02:50:36,000 --> 02:50:37,200
what

2127
02:50:37,200 --> 02:50:40,399
I called and called and finally he answered

2128
02:50:41,280 --> 02:50:43,280
He came straight away then

2129
02:50:44,639 --> 02:50:49,629
Oh, we're getting rocky here. Your mom and dad are

2130
02:50:50,510 --> 02:50:52,350
Happily married

2131
02:50:52,350 --> 02:50:54,590
What are you saying? Of course they are

2132
02:50:58,059 --> 02:51:00,059
Oh, yeah

2133
02:51:00,600 --> 02:51:04,440
Why is dad picking you up instead?

2134
02:51:04,440 --> 02:51:10,680
They weren't happy were they Michelle? Did your father ever hit your mother? Just the once if the one

2135
02:51:11,079 --> 02:51:13,239
She said she would leave him if he ever did it again

2136
02:51:14,440 --> 02:51:16,809
Her brooch pin to make up for it

2137
02:51:17,450 --> 02:51:20,649
Always wore her golden butterfly

2138
02:51:22,010 --> 02:51:25,370
Thanks, miss muller tooth two out of three. What was the third? What?

2139
02:51:27,629 --> 02:51:29,629
Hold on. What was the third issue?

2140
02:51:30,510 --> 02:51:32,510
Daddy the police are here

2141
02:51:32,829 --> 02:51:35,389
I'll talk to the police

2142
02:51:35,709 --> 02:51:38,270
She wasn't telling the truth on she's not even out of school

2143
02:51:38,590 --> 02:51:42,430
You can't come in here interrogating her like she's your wife was found murdered this morning

2144
02:51:43,629 --> 02:51:45,549
Found oh

2145
02:51:45,549 --> 02:51:49,450
But she only

2146
02:51:49,450 --> 02:51:54,920
We have some questions that we would like to ask you

2147
02:51:55,719 --> 02:51:57,020
Sure. Yeah

2148
02:51:57,020 --> 02:51:58,219
Yeah, i'll do my best

2149
02:51:58,219 --> 02:52:00,430
Okay

2150
02:52:00,430 --> 02:52:02,430
footprints at the crime scene

2151
02:52:05,559 --> 02:52:07,559
What is that photo down there?

2152
02:52:08,219 --> 02:52:16,059
That's a really odd photo. What size shoe do you wear? Mr. Muller?

2153
02:52:16,780 --> 02:52:18,680
Why do you ask?

2154
02:52:18,680 --> 02:52:21,020
It's routine sir. Simple process of elimination

2155
02:52:22,559 --> 02:52:26,489
Nines, I think

2156
02:52:26,489 --> 02:52:29,770
Bullshit you got eights in the bedroom. You got eights in the bedroom

2157
02:52:30,409 --> 02:52:32,719
He's got eights in the bedroom

2158
02:52:33,360 --> 02:52:35,360
He's got eights in the bedroom

2159
02:52:41,819 --> 02:52:44,860
That's funny. The work boots we found here are size eights

2160
02:52:45,819 --> 02:52:51,340
Why lie about it if you've got nothing to hide book them because I always get teased about the size of my feet

2161
02:52:53,000 --> 02:52:56,520
You know small feet small always been true in my experience

2162
02:52:57,479 --> 02:52:58,920
small what

2163
02:52:58,920 --> 02:53:01,690
small

2164
02:53:01,690 --> 02:53:10,909
ego

2165
02:53:10,909 --> 02:53:16,909
Well, I uh, just to let you go I wear a size six so I mean I wear a size six women's

2166
02:53:26,479 --> 02:53:41,520
I I wear a size 10. Oh, you want me to prove it on stream? You want to go get my shoes?

2167
02:53:50,559 --> 02:53:55,979
No, i'm not you phoned in a missing person's report this morning. Yeah, that's right

2168
02:53:56,459 --> 02:54:03,120
Uh, my wife didn't come home last night. She left around she left around 9 30

2169
02:54:03,600 --> 02:54:07,180
Michelle was out of dance. She called me to let me know that deejay didn't turn up

2170
02:54:08,139 --> 02:54:10,399
Oh, that's bullshit

2171
02:54:10,399 --> 02:54:17,760
Because your daughter had to call you motherfucker your wife gotcha by herself to bars nightclub mother fucker

2172
02:54:18,399 --> 02:54:21,260
What are you suggesting you suggesting my wife's loose?

2173
02:54:22,700 --> 02:54:26,780
Now is not the time for you to be pushing me. Mr. Your daughter said you were having an argument

2174
02:54:27,180 --> 02:54:29,180
We argued about who would pick up

2175
02:54:29,719 --> 02:54:31,340
Michelle

2176
02:54:31,340 --> 02:54:36,620
I worked a full day. I wanted to come home put my feet up my vice my size eight feet by the way

2177
02:54:37,260 --> 02:54:39,520
Not that small

2178
02:54:39,520 --> 02:54:41,520
uh alibi

2179
02:54:46,700 --> 02:54:50,299
Michelle bolder reports calling home repeatedly with no answer on the night of the murder

2180
02:54:54,190 --> 02:54:56,190
Okay

2181
02:54:56,989 --> 02:55:01,069
So you were here all night? You stayed in while your wife went out to pick up your daughter

2182
02:55:02,520 --> 02:55:03,719
Yes, that's correct

2183
02:55:03,719 --> 02:55:14,030
Well, I didn't answer the phone. I don't wait right because

2184
02:55:17,389 --> 02:55:20,430
Yeah, you nobody answered. So you didn't yeah

2185
02:55:20,430 --> 02:55:21,430
Yeah, you're in deep shit.

2186
02:55:28,399 --> 02:55:33,399
Yeah, cause your daughter called you over and over again.

2187
02:55:49,639 --> 02:55:51,940
Movements of victim. What the hell does that mean?

2188
02:55:51,940 --> 02:55:55,200
Your wife went to pick up Michelle?

2189
02:55:55,200 --> 02:55:58,399
Yes. That's right.

2190
02:56:05,399 --> 02:56:13,879
What happened, Hugo? You got any theories?

2191
02:56:13,879 --> 02:56:15,879
Because we're starting to like you for this.

2192
02:56:15,879 --> 02:56:18,700
The car park by the school is kind of dark.

2193
02:56:18,700 --> 02:56:23,260
Maybe somebody jumped her there. Did you try the parking lot?

2194
02:56:27,290 --> 02:56:30,719
Your wife was beaten and then strangled.

2195
02:56:30,719 --> 02:56:32,719
In the case you had no alibi.

2196
02:56:32,719 --> 02:56:34,719
And the history of violence taught your wife.

2197
02:56:34,719 --> 02:56:37,719
That's not, that's not true. God damn it.

2198
02:56:37,719 --> 02:56:40,219
Do I have any evidence of that though?

2199
02:56:40,219 --> 02:56:42,219
Can I say your daughter told me?

2200
02:56:42,219 --> 02:56:46,569
I can't say that you did that.

2201
02:56:54,190 --> 02:56:58,030
Oh fuck, alright. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2202
02:56:58,030 --> 02:57:01,030
Cause he bought it cause he was trying to be...

2203
02:57:01,030 --> 02:57:04,030
It is true, Hugo. You're a violent man.

2204
02:57:04,030 --> 02:57:07,030
I got it. I got it. Oh my god.

2205
02:57:07,030 --> 02:57:09,030
Can I just take a second?

2206
02:57:09,030 --> 02:57:11,030
Your daughter and your wife were scared of you.

2207
02:57:11,030 --> 02:57:13,030
Brooch. Brooch. Brooch. Brooch.

2208
02:57:13,030 --> 02:57:15,030
I just wanted to look.

2209
02:57:15,030 --> 02:57:18,420
Brooch.

2210
02:57:18,420 --> 02:57:21,170
I know about the golden butterfly, Hugo.

2211
02:57:21,170 --> 02:57:24,170
And how you bought your wife off the last time you heard her.

2212
02:57:24,170 --> 02:57:26,729
She liked to spend money, alright?

2213
02:57:26,729 --> 02:57:29,729
Dresses, jewelry, her hair. It drove me god damn crazy.

2214
02:57:29,729 --> 02:57:31,729
Crazy enough to kill?

2215
02:57:31,729 --> 02:57:33,729
Do I look like a Rockefeller?

2216
02:57:33,729 --> 02:57:35,729
Nobody likes a cheapskate, Hugo.

2217
02:57:35,729 --> 02:57:37,229
Thanks for chiming in.

2218
02:57:37,229 --> 02:57:39,229
Getting hostile with us is a very bad idea, Hugo.

2219
02:57:39,229 --> 02:57:41,229
What was the... I'm no murderer.

2220
02:57:41,229 --> 02:57:43,229
Make some arrangements for your daughter.

2221
02:57:43,229 --> 02:57:45,229
And then present yourself to Central Station for questioning.

2222
02:57:45,229 --> 02:57:47,229
You gotta be kidding me, Phelps. Put the cops on.

2223
02:57:47,229 --> 02:57:48,229
Not good enough.

2224
02:57:48,229 --> 02:57:50,229
This is an outrage. I didn't kill my wife.

2225
02:57:50,229 --> 02:57:53,229
Your daughter is in the next room, Mueller, so I'm giving you a break.

2226
02:57:53,229 --> 02:57:57,229
Don't make me change my mind and don't make me come looking for you.

2227
02:57:57,229 --> 02:58:06,469
We should go back in there and bust his ass.

2228
02:58:06,469 --> 02:58:09,469
One, we need to break his alibi, check phone records, canvas the neighbors.

2229
02:58:09,469 --> 02:58:13,469
Two, we have motive of domestic violence, which probably goes for half the men in L.A.

2230
02:58:13,469 --> 02:58:17,469
Three, we have no evidence tying him to the crime scene.

2231
02:58:17,469 --> 02:58:18,959
Hello. Detective.

2232
02:58:18,959 --> 02:58:20,959
Oh, I thought the MPC was waving.

2233
02:58:20,959 --> 02:58:25,059
Why would we do this?

2234
02:58:25,059 --> 02:58:29,879
Yes, ma'am.

2235
02:58:29,879 --> 02:58:32,879
I heard the terrible news over the radio.

2236
02:58:32,879 --> 02:58:34,879
You heard the terrible news through the window.

2237
02:58:34,879 --> 02:58:37,879
Yes, sir. They had a row last night?

2238
02:58:37,879 --> 02:58:38,879
Seed baby food.

2239
02:58:38,879 --> 02:58:39,879
I heard Mrs. Mueller screaming.

2240
02:58:39,879 --> 02:58:42,879
Did you see Mrs. Mueller come home late last night at all?

2241
02:58:42,879 --> 02:58:44,879
No, not at all.

2242
02:58:44,879 --> 02:58:48,879
I did see Mr. Mueller put something in the incinerator earlier this morning, though.

2243
02:58:48,879 --> 02:58:52,879
I told him he was a god. Let's get this bum downtown and into his cell.

2244
02:58:52,879 --> 02:58:53,879
He's like incinerating his wife's body.

2245
02:58:53,879 --> 02:58:55,879
Look, there he is now.

2246
02:58:55,879 --> 02:58:58,879
There it is. There it is. He's incinerating.

2247
02:58:58,879 --> 02:59:02,190
He's incinerating. Sir, what are you incinerating?

2248
02:59:02,190 --> 02:59:04,190
Step away from the incinerator.

2249
02:59:04,190 --> 02:59:05,190
What is it?

2250
02:59:05,190 --> 02:59:06,190
I'll let him get away.

2251
02:59:06,190 --> 02:59:07,190
What is it? It's a shoe.

2252
02:59:07,190 --> 02:59:08,190
We need this guy to make the clean.

2253
02:59:08,190 --> 02:59:10,190
He's incinerating his shoes.

2254
02:59:10,190 --> 02:59:17,000
No time for that.

2255
02:59:17,000 --> 02:59:30,840
Can I get on the tricycle?

2256
02:59:30,840 --> 02:59:33,840
Jay's asking him on the tricycle.

2257
02:59:33,840 --> 02:59:48,969
Enough running, Hugo.

2258
02:59:48,969 --> 02:59:49,969
Hands up.

2259
02:59:49,969 --> 02:59:50,969
That's what we can see them.

2260
02:59:50,969 --> 02:59:57,690
Turns out it was just like a turkey.

2261
02:59:57,690 --> 03:00:07,180
No, you don't understand. I was trying to cook the shoes. Leather. It's beef.

2262
03:00:07,180 --> 03:00:10,889
This doesn't look good, Hugo.

2263
03:00:10,889 --> 03:00:13,520
I can explain the blood.

2264
03:00:13,520 --> 03:00:17,229
Get him booked in at Central, officer.

2265
03:00:17,229 --> 03:00:19,229
Then put him in an interview room.

2266
03:00:19,229 --> 03:00:21,229
Where's the shoes? The shoes did it.

2267
03:00:21,229 --> 03:00:23,229
Yes, sir, detective.

2268
03:00:23,229 --> 03:00:25,469
Is there someone you can call, Miss?

2269
03:00:25,469 --> 03:00:27,469
I don't...

2270
03:00:27,469 --> 03:00:28,469
No one's home and...

2271
03:00:28,469 --> 03:00:30,469
You need somewhere to stay, Michelle.

2272
03:00:30,469 --> 03:00:33,469
You have other family? Grandparents? Aunt's or uncle?

2273
03:00:33,469 --> 03:00:36,469
Call Aunt Helen, but she lives in Acres Field and...

2274
03:00:36,469 --> 03:00:37,469
Call her.

2275
03:00:37,469 --> 03:00:41,469
We're going to get someone down here from Juvenile Hall to talk to you in the meantime.

2276
03:00:41,469 --> 03:00:43,469
Juvenile Hall?

2277
03:00:43,469 --> 03:00:45,469
We ought to get some uniforms down here.

2278
03:00:45,469 --> 03:00:47,469
Why are we sending her to Juvenile Hall?

2279
03:00:47,469 --> 03:00:48,469
To take care of the kid.

2280
03:00:48,469 --> 03:00:49,469
What?

2281
03:00:49,469 --> 03:00:58,920
It would take a smarter man than me to connect that.

2282
03:00:58,920 --> 03:01:13,100
Start playing the violin.

2283
03:01:17,729 --> 03:01:20,729
Oh, that's evil. That's not okay.

2284
03:01:20,729 --> 03:01:23,729
Thank you for your assistance. Bye.

2285
03:01:23,729 --> 03:01:29,840
Telephone. I need a phone.

2286
03:01:29,840 --> 03:01:35,149
Operator, give me dispatch.

2287
03:01:35,149 --> 03:01:36,149
Putting you through now.

2288
03:01:36,149 --> 03:01:41,139
At first I thought the phone wasn't connected.

2289
03:01:41,139 --> 03:01:43,569
Phelps, 1247.

2290
03:01:43,569 --> 03:01:48,950
Help, detective.

2291
03:01:48,950 --> 03:01:51,250
I need an address on a Belmont High School.

2292
03:01:51,250 --> 03:01:52,250
That's not it.

2293
03:01:52,250 --> 03:01:54,250
Checking for you, detective.

2294
03:01:54,250 --> 03:02:02,719
Thanks for your help.

2295
03:02:02,719 --> 03:02:06,049
Nice made-up name. Told you.

2296
03:02:06,049 --> 03:02:09,049
Oh, wait, that's not it?

2297
03:02:09,049 --> 03:02:14,299
Didn't we just arrest the guy?

2298
03:02:14,299 --> 03:02:16,299
Homicide Division, badge number 564.

2299
03:02:16,299 --> 03:02:17,299
Go ahead.

2300
03:02:19,819 --> 03:02:21,819
Did we get Ray Pinker and a technical services team

2301
03:02:21,819 --> 03:02:24,819
to a house at 130 North Bonnie Blay Street?

2302
03:02:24,819 --> 03:02:26,819
Send someone down to Juvenile Hall

2303
03:02:26,819 --> 03:02:29,819
to look after a young lady.

2304
03:02:29,819 --> 03:02:35,200
What if I just tossed the notebook out the window?

2305
03:02:35,200 --> 03:02:45,690
I don't need any more evidence.

2306
03:02:45,690 --> 03:02:48,690
Oh, fuck, I did leave mine. Whatever.

2307
03:02:48,690 --> 03:02:58,100
No harm done.

2308
03:02:58,100 --> 03:03:02,729
Are they trying to get to me?

2309
03:03:02,729 --> 03:03:03,729
Why won't I pick up the radio?

2310
03:03:03,729 --> 03:03:05,729
I won't pick the radio up.

2311
03:03:08,100 --> 03:03:11,100
Sorry, I can't reach the radio.

2312
03:03:11,100 --> 03:03:16,799
Uh-oh, he's gone rogue.

2313
03:03:16,799 --> 03:03:23,709
I'm on my own time now.

2314
03:03:23,709 --> 03:03:37,469
I'll take care of this myself.

2315
03:03:37,469 --> 03:03:41,180
One hot dog, please!

2316
03:03:43,870 --> 03:03:46,069
What? What do I have to do?

2317
03:03:46,069 --> 03:03:48,069
Do I have to get ice cream?

2318
03:03:58,649 --> 03:03:59,649
One of them was assaulted.

2319
03:03:59,649 --> 03:04:02,649
Yeah! Yeah!

2320
03:04:02,649 --> 03:04:12,549
Do I have to go get my partner?

2321
03:04:12,549 --> 03:04:18,290
You're a great crowd.

2322
03:04:18,290 --> 03:04:20,290
Do I actually have to answer the radio

2323
03:04:20,290 --> 03:04:21,290
before I can come here?

2324
03:04:21,290 --> 03:04:28,079
God damn it. Okay.

2325
03:04:28,079 --> 03:04:30,700
Yeah.

2326
03:04:30,700 --> 03:04:34,909
Nope. All right.

2327
03:04:35,909 --> 03:04:37,909
Okay.

2328
03:04:43,719 --> 03:04:45,719
Is it all seed at the bottom?

2329
03:04:45,719 --> 03:04:47,719
This is going to be disgusting.

2330
03:04:51,719 --> 03:04:54,629
Who the hell is this?

2331
03:04:54,629 --> 03:04:56,629
Why are we chasing this person?

2332
03:04:56,629 --> 03:05:01,239
Watch out for the kids smoking weed under here.

2333
03:05:01,239 --> 03:05:05,079
Or cigarettes, either or.

2334
03:05:06,079 --> 03:05:26,239
You. You.

2335
03:05:26,239 --> 03:05:27,549
Oh, that wasn't you.

2336
03:05:27,549 --> 03:05:28,549
That wasn't you.

2337
03:05:28,549 --> 03:05:29,549
It's you.

2338
03:05:29,549 --> 03:05:30,549
Quick.

2339
03:05:30,549 --> 03:05:49,469
And he's slowing down, slowing down, slowing down.

2340
03:05:49,469 --> 03:05:53,469
Just enough for me to get him.

2341
03:05:53,469 --> 03:06:06,840
Scripted.

2342
03:06:06,840 --> 03:06:10,750
Who is this guy?

2343
03:06:10,750 --> 03:06:14,479
11K, go ahead.

2344
03:06:14,479 --> 03:06:15,479
Really?

2345
03:06:15,479 --> 03:06:33,280
What's your name?

2346
03:06:33,280 --> 03:06:35,280
So we got him.

2347
03:06:35,280 --> 03:06:37,590
Who's asking?

2348
03:06:37,590 --> 03:06:40,889
We can do this the easy way or the hard way.

2349
03:06:40,889 --> 03:06:42,889
Name's Eli Rooney.

2350
03:06:42,889 --> 03:06:44,889
You've been in trouble with the law before, Eli?

2351
03:06:44,889 --> 03:06:45,889
Some.

2352
03:06:45,889 --> 03:06:46,889
What are you doing around here?

2353
03:06:46,889 --> 03:06:48,889
I like to keep an eye on the children.

2354
03:06:48,889 --> 03:06:50,889
Strictly paternal, is it, Eli?

2355
03:06:50,889 --> 03:06:52,889
Don't sass me, boy.

2356
03:06:52,889 --> 03:06:54,889
A woman was abducted here last night, Eli, and murdered.

2357
03:06:54,889 --> 03:06:57,889
And I would love to make you for that, you low-key motherfucker.

2358
03:06:57,889 --> 03:07:00,889
Well, I wouldn't know nothing about that.

2359
03:07:00,889 --> 03:07:02,889
A woman, you say?

2360
03:07:02,889 --> 03:07:05,129
I like them a little younger than that.

2361
03:07:05,129 --> 03:07:06,129
Turn out your pockets, Eli.

2362
03:07:06,129 --> 03:07:08,129
Why would I do that?

2363
03:07:08,129 --> 03:07:12,129
Because I'm about to break your fucking skull, Eli.

2364
03:07:12,129 --> 03:07:15,200
What the fuck is wrong with you?

2365
03:07:15,200 --> 03:07:17,200
You're under arrest, Eli.

2366
03:07:17,200 --> 03:07:19,200
You're in very deep trouble.

2367
03:07:19,200 --> 03:07:20,200
It's a brooch.

2368
03:07:20,200 --> 03:07:21,200
Get some backup down here, Rusty.

2369
03:07:21,200 --> 03:07:24,200
We need to get this one downtown and into a cell.

2370
03:07:24,200 --> 03:07:25,200
Okay.

2371
03:07:25,200 --> 03:07:26,200
I'll tell them.

2372
03:07:26,200 --> 03:07:33,709
So wait, that means, all right, so what about the other guy?

2373
03:07:33,709 --> 03:07:40,149
What time did you see the person park the car?

2374
03:07:40,149 --> 03:07:44,149
Late last night, after school social, maybe 1 a.m.

2375
03:07:44,149 --> 03:07:46,319
Let me keep it a good eye out lately.

2376
03:07:46,319 --> 03:07:48,319
We've had problems with the child molester.

2377
03:07:48,319 --> 03:07:50,319
Eli Rooney, we've met him.

2378
03:07:50,319 --> 03:07:52,319
Filthy son of a bitch.

2379
03:07:52,319 --> 03:07:53,319
Excuse me?

2380
03:07:53,319 --> 03:07:55,319
He was here yesterday before the dance.

2381
03:07:55,319 --> 03:07:56,319
Was it him you saw park the car?

2382
03:07:56,319 --> 03:07:57,319
I don't know, sir.

2383
03:07:57,319 --> 03:07:58,319
I'm not pressing any buttons.

2384
03:07:58,319 --> 03:07:59,319
It's just going quick.

2385
03:07:59,319 --> 03:08:01,319
I'd like to say yes, but the truth is, it was pretty dark.

2386
03:08:01,319 --> 03:08:03,319
Would you say Rooney is violent?

2387
03:08:03,319 --> 03:08:04,319
Yes, sir.

2388
03:08:04,319 --> 03:08:06,319
I would say so, yes.

2389
03:08:06,319 --> 03:08:08,319
Thanks for your help.

2390
03:08:08,319 --> 03:08:22,659
Oh, okay.

2391
03:08:22,659 --> 03:08:28,440
Wow.

2392
03:08:28,440 --> 03:08:30,579
This is the car?

2393
03:08:30,579 --> 03:08:31,579
Yes, sir, detective.

2394
03:08:31,579 --> 03:08:32,579
Have you looked it over?

2395
03:08:32,579 --> 03:08:33,579
Superficially.

2396
03:08:33,579 --> 03:08:36,079
I was told to wait for you guys.

2397
03:08:36,079 --> 03:08:37,079
Thanks.

2398
03:08:37,079 --> 03:08:38,079
We'll take it from here.

2399
03:08:38,079 --> 03:08:39,079
Okay.

2400
03:08:39,079 --> 03:08:42,250
Well, I wonder what this stuff is for.

2401
03:08:42,250 --> 03:08:43,250
Right.

2402
03:08:43,250 --> 03:08:45,250
Blood and skin samples.

2403
03:08:45,250 --> 03:08:47,250
We better get Ray Pinker out here.

2404
03:08:47,250 --> 03:08:52,049
Just some bloody stuff.

2405
03:08:52,049 --> 03:08:54,049
The overalls are stenciled HM.

2406
03:08:54,049 --> 03:08:55,049
The motor is a mechanic.

2407
03:08:55,049 --> 03:08:58,299
I wonder what Eli does for a living.

2408
03:08:58,299 --> 03:09:07,709
It's from a Chrysler.

2409
03:09:07,709 --> 03:09:10,780
Could be important.

2410
03:09:10,780 --> 03:09:12,780
Chrysler, tire, iron.

2411
03:09:13,780 --> 03:09:20,629
Anybody have a phone?

2412
03:09:20,629 --> 03:09:28,649
No evidence in here.

2413
03:09:28,649 --> 03:09:30,649
Time to call it a night.

2414
03:09:30,649 --> 03:09:48,379
Phelps, batch 1247.

2415
03:09:48,379 --> 03:09:51,280
Detective?

2416
03:09:51,280 --> 03:09:53,280
I need interrogations set up at Central

2417
03:09:53,280 --> 03:09:55,280
for both suspects being held in the Mahler homicide case.

2418
03:09:55,280 --> 03:09:57,280
Oh, we've got to figure this shit out, then.

2419
03:09:57,280 --> 03:09:58,280
Certainly, detective.

2420
03:09:58,280 --> 03:10:00,280
I'll get in touch with the watch commander.

2421
03:10:00,280 --> 03:10:01,280
Thank you.

2422
03:10:01,280 --> 03:10:07,030
Interrogation time.

2423
03:10:07,030 --> 03:10:09,030
I'm not very good at these.

2424
03:10:09,030 --> 03:10:20,159
Is there something wrong with this car?

2425
03:10:20,159 --> 03:10:24,129
I mean...

2426
03:10:24,129 --> 03:10:27,079
I can't...

2427
03:10:27,079 --> 03:10:30,020
I guess so.

2428
03:10:36,229 --> 03:10:43,590
Get out.

2429
03:10:43,590 --> 03:10:45,590
I did not do that.

2430
03:10:45,590 --> 03:10:48,979
I say we make Rooney for this.

2431
03:10:48,979 --> 03:10:50,979
I think we should lay it on him.

2432
03:10:50,979 --> 03:10:52,979
More at the police station.

2433
03:10:52,979 --> 03:10:54,979
The DA will love him for it.

2434
03:10:54,979 --> 03:10:56,979
Even if he didn't do it?

2435
03:10:56,979 --> 03:10:58,979
Who cares whether he did it?

2436
03:10:58,979 --> 03:11:00,979
You have kids, Phelps.

2437
03:11:00,979 --> 03:11:02,979
He needs to be taken permanently out of harm's way.

2438
03:11:02,979 --> 03:11:04,979
And we let Mueller slide?

2439
03:11:04,979 --> 03:11:06,979
For a while.

2440
03:11:06,979 --> 03:11:08,979
He gets a free pass for now.

2441
03:11:08,979 --> 03:11:13,569
I don't know about Mueller. My gut says Mueller.

2442
03:11:13,569 --> 03:11:15,569
We caught him trying to destroy evidence in his backyard.

2443
03:11:15,569 --> 03:11:17,569
And that was his car with the bloody tools in it.

2444
03:11:17,569 --> 03:11:19,569
I never said it wasn't Mueller.

2445
03:11:19,569 --> 03:11:21,569
Hell, he probably killed his wife,

2446
03:11:21,569 --> 03:11:23,569
deprived that poor kid of a mother.

2447
03:11:23,569 --> 03:11:25,569
But he's not in immediate danger

2448
03:11:25,569 --> 03:11:27,569
to anyone else.

2449
03:11:27,569 --> 03:11:29,569
Rooney's a threat to every kid at Bethel.

2450
03:11:29,569 --> 03:11:31,569
He's a peeper, Rusty.

2451
03:11:31,569 --> 03:11:33,569
We could pick him up for something else.

2452
03:11:33,569 --> 03:11:35,569
Do we want to run that risk?

2453
03:11:35,569 --> 03:11:38,709
Why don't we just fuse them together

2454
03:11:38,709 --> 03:11:40,709
and then try them at the same time?

2455
03:11:47,809 --> 03:12:05,090
The court system is so backed up.

2456
03:12:05,090 --> 03:12:09,440
Just get them to like a

2457
03:12:09,440 --> 03:12:11,440
lab mad scientist lair

2458
03:12:11,440 --> 03:12:13,440
and turn them into Goro.

2459
03:12:28,309 --> 03:12:32,850
Epic gamer reference.

2460
03:12:32,850 --> 03:12:44,739
Hey, nevermind.

2461
03:12:44,739 --> 03:12:46,739
Massive ethical nightmare.

2462
03:12:46,739 --> 03:13:05,280
Wow!

2463
03:13:05,280 --> 03:13:07,280
Let's go to the morgue and let's take a look at some clues

2464
03:13:07,280 --> 03:13:09,280
and evidence

2465
03:13:09,280 --> 03:13:11,840
and find out

2466
03:13:11,840 --> 03:13:13,840
who's the bad guy.

2467
03:13:28,100 --> 03:13:30,100
Why is the morgue in elementary school?

2468
03:13:30,100 --> 03:13:35,479
Alright, what do we do with...

2469
03:13:35,479 --> 03:13:40,850
Hey, that's not the morgue, doctor.

2470
03:13:40,850 --> 03:13:44,440
Viewing gallery?

2471
03:13:44,440 --> 03:13:51,270
Staff only?

2472
03:13:51,270 --> 03:13:53,270
Oh, look.

2473
03:13:57,270 --> 03:13:59,270
I think he's any kind of doctor.

2474
03:14:03,270 --> 03:14:05,270
Correct.

2475
03:14:05,270 --> 03:14:16,790
Take a look at the samples on the bench.

2476
03:14:16,790 --> 03:14:36,930
What am I doing?

2477
03:14:36,930 --> 03:14:39,809
Oh, I need to... Okay.

2478
03:14:39,809 --> 03:14:41,809
Well, it's definitely not the finger trap one.

2479
03:14:41,809 --> 03:14:49,110
It's probably this one.

2480
03:14:54,420 --> 03:14:56,420
This is a baby's puzzle?

2481
03:14:56,420 --> 03:14:58,420
I didn't know it was a puzzle!

2482
03:14:58,420 --> 03:15:00,420
He just said, there are three things there.

2483
03:15:00,420 --> 03:15:03,479
Look at them.

2484
03:15:03,479 --> 03:15:05,479
Come on!

2485
03:15:05,479 --> 03:15:07,479
I didn't know what I was doing until I looked at it

2486
03:15:07,479 --> 03:15:09,479
for a second.

2487
03:15:19,719 --> 03:15:21,719
God, I get like

2488
03:15:21,719 --> 03:15:23,719
one and a half, two seconds to figure out

2489
03:15:23,719 --> 03:15:25,719
what I need to do with a thing I've never seen?

2490
03:15:25,719 --> 03:15:27,719
Come on!

2491
03:15:27,719 --> 03:15:32,840
I'm not superhuman!

2492
03:15:32,840 --> 03:15:38,469
What's this?

2493
03:15:38,469 --> 03:15:47,729
What else you got?

2494
03:15:47,729 --> 03:15:49,729
Drink everything in the cabinet.

2495
03:15:49,729 --> 03:15:59,459
Oh, these are clay.

2496
03:15:59,459 --> 03:16:06,549
Dinosaurs.

2497
03:16:06,549 --> 03:16:08,549
Let's see, which one of these is the T-Rex?

2498
03:16:08,549 --> 03:16:23,969
Am I supposed to

2499
03:16:23,969 --> 03:16:29,799
touch them?

2500
03:16:29,799 --> 03:16:31,799
That's it.

2501
03:16:39,799 --> 03:16:44,659
Well, thank you, doctor.

2502
03:16:44,659 --> 03:16:47,219
You've been a lot of help.

2503
03:16:53,649 --> 03:17:07,399
Okay. Thank you, doctor.

2504
03:17:07,399 --> 03:17:14,819
Okay. Bye.

2505
03:17:14,819 --> 03:17:21,350
Go get the nail gun?

2506
03:17:21,350 --> 03:17:25,059
Yeah, that's a really bad sweeping technique.

2507
03:17:25,059 --> 03:17:27,059
That's just gonna put it in the air and make everybody start sneezing.

2508
03:17:27,059 --> 03:17:42,020
Okay.

2509
03:17:42,020 --> 03:17:49,120
Police station time.

2510
03:17:53,120 --> 03:17:55,120
Did you have a red light?

2511
03:17:55,120 --> 03:17:57,120
I had a red light.

2512
03:17:57,120 --> 03:18:00,129
Have we got engine noises back? That's a good thing.

2513
03:18:06,129 --> 03:18:08,129
Funny job, that.

2514
03:18:08,129 --> 03:18:10,129
Corners.

2515
03:18:10,129 --> 03:18:12,129
Not even a scratch.

2516
03:18:16,129 --> 03:18:18,129
Small scratch.

2517
03:18:28,129 --> 03:18:33,250
We've played enough missions where I know

2518
03:18:33,250 --> 03:18:35,250
that if you just get close, it's gonna be fine.

2519
03:18:35,250 --> 03:18:42,799
Charge the suspects with murder.

2520
03:18:44,979 --> 03:18:46,979
Evidence rusty. Let him do the rest.

2521
03:18:46,979 --> 03:18:50,440
Okay.

2522
03:18:50,440 --> 03:18:52,680
Interview room one, interview room two.

2523
03:18:52,680 --> 03:18:54,680
Are they ready?

2524
03:18:54,680 --> 03:18:56,680
Bowler's in two and the pervert's in one.

2525
03:18:56,680 --> 03:18:58,850
Get in there and get a conviction.

2526
03:18:58,850 --> 03:19:00,850
Hey, you think those vice boys

2527
03:19:00,850 --> 03:19:05,010
get any on the side?

2528
03:19:05,010 --> 03:19:07,639
Alright, where is it?

2529
03:19:07,639 --> 03:19:19,219
Interview room two.

2530
03:19:19,219 --> 03:19:21,399
Who's in here?

2531
03:19:21,399 --> 03:19:23,399
Your next door neighbor heard screaming

2532
03:19:23,399 --> 03:19:25,399
coming from your house.

2533
03:19:25,399 --> 03:19:27,399
You were burning your blood-stained shoes.

2534
03:19:27,399 --> 03:19:29,399
You can confirm your whereabouts last night.

2535
03:19:29,399 --> 03:19:31,399
Your daughter says you're a violent man.

2536
03:19:31,399 --> 03:19:33,399
We have everything we need to send you to death row.

2537
03:19:33,399 --> 03:19:35,399
And all you have to say for yourself

2538
03:19:35,399 --> 03:19:38,399
is I didn't do it.

2539
03:19:38,399 --> 03:19:40,399
I swear I didn't kill her.

2540
03:19:40,399 --> 03:19:42,399
Give me that lie test. I can prove it.

2541
03:19:42,399 --> 03:19:45,600
The lie test.

2542
03:19:45,600 --> 03:19:49,829
Give me the lie test.

2543
03:19:49,829 --> 03:19:51,829
Why did you burn your shoes, Hugo?

2544
03:19:51,829 --> 03:19:53,829
This is what I don't understand.

2545
03:19:53,829 --> 03:20:00,479
Because I knew you'd never believe me.

2546
03:20:00,479 --> 03:20:02,479
I mean, what?

2547
03:20:02,479 --> 03:20:09,719
Why did you do that? Because you wouldn't believe me.

2548
03:20:09,719 --> 03:20:11,719
Are you going to tell me what I want to know?

2549
03:20:11,719 --> 03:20:15,680
Or do we have to take it out of you in lumps?

2550
03:20:15,680 --> 03:20:17,680
You're at your best shot.

2551
03:20:17,680 --> 03:20:19,860
I can take whatever you're throwing.

2552
03:20:19,860 --> 03:20:21,860
Do you know anything about ropes, Hugo?

2553
03:20:21,860 --> 03:20:26,530
As much as the next man?

2554
03:20:26,530 --> 03:20:28,959
I was a scout.

2555
03:20:28,959 --> 03:20:31,780
I learned some more in the army.

2556
03:20:31,780 --> 03:20:33,780
Do we have anything?

2557
03:20:33,780 --> 03:20:43,569
Can I look at those rope?

2558
03:20:43,569 --> 03:20:57,840
You learned to strangle with the rope in the army?

2559
03:20:57,840 --> 03:20:59,840
We've got a bad cop, this guy.

2560
03:20:59,840 --> 03:21:01,840
With rope, with my bare hands,

2561
03:21:01,840 --> 03:21:03,840
but mainly with wire.

2562
03:21:03,840 --> 03:21:06,280
I learned a lot of things in the army,

2563
03:21:06,280 --> 03:21:08,280
but I still didn't kill my wife.

2564
03:21:08,280 --> 03:21:10,280
For argument's sake,

2565
03:21:10,280 --> 03:21:12,280
what type of rope would you use?

2566
03:21:12,280 --> 03:21:14,280
If I had to, I would use a triple braid.

2567
03:21:14,280 --> 03:21:16,280
Less flex, easier to control.

2568
03:21:16,280 --> 03:21:18,280
That's what it was.

2569
03:21:18,280 --> 03:21:21,280
That's what it was.

2570
03:21:21,280 --> 03:21:23,280
That's what it was. He just said the thing that it was.

2571
03:21:23,280 --> 03:21:27,510
We found your wife's car.

2572
03:21:27,510 --> 03:21:29,510
Someone parked it at the school late last night.

2573
03:21:29,510 --> 03:21:31,510
Do you have anything to say about that?

2574
03:21:31,510 --> 03:21:33,750
It wasn't me.

2575
03:21:33,750 --> 03:21:36,819
Where do you keep your work clothes?

2576
03:21:36,819 --> 03:21:39,569
I keep them at work in my locker.

2577
03:21:39,569 --> 03:21:44,760
Wait, where?

2578
03:21:44,760 --> 03:21:53,829
That was in the trunk.

2579
03:21:53,829 --> 03:21:55,829
You killed your wife in cold blood.

2580
03:21:55,829 --> 03:21:57,829
You're f-

2581
03:21:57,829 --> 03:21:59,829
Enough lies, Hugo.

2582
03:21:59,829 --> 03:22:02,319
Your overalls put you at the scene of the crime last night.

2583
03:22:02,319 --> 03:22:04,319
My overalls are in the laundry of my house.

2584
03:22:04,319 --> 03:22:06,319
Oh, well.

2585
03:22:06,319 --> 03:22:08,319
That evidence begs to differ

2586
03:22:08,319 --> 03:22:10,319
unless somebody faked it.

2587
03:22:10,319 --> 03:22:12,319
Green overalls, blood stained,

2588
03:22:12,319 --> 03:22:14,319
with the initials HM

2589
03:22:14,319 --> 03:22:16,319
found in the trunk of your wife's car.

2590
03:22:16,319 --> 03:22:19,200
They can't be mine.

2591
03:22:19,200 --> 03:22:21,200
Why, Hugo?

2592
03:22:21,200 --> 03:22:23,200
Because if they were yours, they'd be in the incinerator, too?

2593
03:22:23,200 --> 03:22:25,200
Because if they were yours, they'd be in the incinerator, too?

2594
03:22:25,200 --> 03:22:31,600
Your wife was beaten with a tire iron, Hugo.

2595
03:22:31,600 --> 03:22:33,600
An appropriate choice of tool for a mechanic.

2596
03:22:33,600 --> 03:22:35,600
An appropriate choice of tool for a mechanic.

2597
03:22:35,600 --> 03:22:37,600
I know nothing about any tire iron.

2598
03:22:37,600 --> 03:22:39,600
We just picked it up.

2599
03:22:39,600 --> 03:22:41,600
It was in the trunk, right?

2600
03:22:41,600 --> 03:22:46,209
Tire iron stained with blood

2601
03:22:46,209 --> 03:22:48,209
found in the trunk of

2602
03:22:48,209 --> 03:22:50,209
Muller's vehicle.

2603
03:22:50,209 --> 03:22:55,399
You're lying, Hugo.

2604
03:22:55,399 --> 03:22:57,399
You have to come clean on this.

2605
03:22:57,399 --> 03:22:59,399
I can take whatever you throw at me.

2606
03:22:59,399 --> 03:23:05,479
Put those feet up here.

2607
03:23:05,479 --> 03:23:08,549
Your wife drove a Chevrolet, Hugo.

2608
03:23:08,549 --> 03:23:10,549
What make of car do you drive?

2609
03:23:10,549 --> 03:23:13,299
Chrysler Airflow.

2610
03:23:13,299 --> 03:23:15,540
So I guess that explains why

2611
03:23:15,540 --> 03:23:17,540
the tire iron that killed your wife came from a Chrysler.

2612
03:23:17,540 --> 03:23:22,850
He did it.

2613
03:23:28,420 --> 03:23:30,420
You dared the crime.

2614
03:23:30,420 --> 03:23:32,420
You got the bloody tire iron. Your bloody clothes are in the trunk.

2615
03:23:32,420 --> 03:23:39,270
Check. Wait, wait, what?

2616
03:23:39,270 --> 03:23:41,889
Interrogate the other guy.

2617
03:23:41,889 --> 03:23:44,709
Oh, that's right. There's another person.

2618
03:23:44,709 --> 03:23:47,010
Do I, what? Do I have to like make a choice now though?

2619
03:23:47,010 --> 03:23:49,889
If I leave this, is it like,

2620
03:23:49,889 --> 03:23:51,889
ah, you fucked it up again, Phelps.

2621
03:23:51,889 --> 03:23:53,889
Like it happened before. Can I leave?

2622
03:23:53,889 --> 03:24:12,950
Okay.

2623
03:24:12,950 --> 03:24:14,950
Where is the other guy? I'm assuming he's in the other interview room.

2624
03:24:14,950 --> 03:24:19,620
Which is

2625
03:24:19,620 --> 03:24:23,190
where? Over here.

2626
03:24:23,190 --> 03:24:25,620
Captain, we were on our way to interview Eli Rooney.

2627
03:24:25,620 --> 03:24:27,620
Captain, we were on our way to interview Eli Rooney.

2628
03:24:27,620 --> 03:24:30,120
Yes, Phelps, I know.

2629
03:24:30,120 --> 03:24:32,120
This particular fiend is an old acquaintance.

2630
03:24:32,120 --> 03:24:34,120
An old acquaintance? Equations?

2631
03:24:34,120 --> 03:24:36,120
He believes in a wrathful and terrible god.

2632
03:24:36,120 --> 03:24:38,420
Whichever way it goes,

2633
03:24:38,420 --> 03:24:41,430
he'd deal him personally.

2634
03:24:41,430 --> 03:24:47,809
What? Oh.

2635
03:24:47,809 --> 03:24:50,559
Okay.

2636
03:24:50,559 --> 03:24:52,799
You look like you've had it rough.

2637
03:24:52,799 --> 03:24:54,799
You see me asking for your sympathy, boy?

2638
03:24:54,799 --> 03:24:57,879
Ah,

2639
03:24:57,879 --> 03:25:00,629
fuck, hold on.

2640
03:25:00,629 --> 03:25:08,440
This is all we have.

2641
03:25:08,440 --> 03:25:12,020
You're down on your luck, Eli.

2642
03:25:12,020 --> 03:25:14,020
I had worse.

2643
03:25:14,020 --> 03:25:16,020
My family a roadkill during the Dust Bowl.

2644
03:25:16,020 --> 03:25:18,020
But you have a job. A parolee has to have a job, correct?

2645
03:25:18,020 --> 03:25:20,020
I have me a job down in San Pedro.

2646
03:25:20,020 --> 03:25:22,020
I'm looking for something new.

2647
03:25:22,020 --> 03:25:24,319
This place you worked have a name?

2648
03:25:24,319 --> 03:25:40,840
Hennessey Marine.

2649
03:25:40,840 --> 03:25:42,840
I don't like that.

2650
03:25:42,840 --> 03:25:44,840
This place, big yellow letters, HML.

2651
03:25:44,840 --> 03:25:46,840
This game's hard.

2652
03:25:46,840 --> 03:25:48,840
They give you any work wear, Eli?

2653
03:25:48,840 --> 03:25:50,840
Sure.

2654
03:25:50,840 --> 03:25:52,840
Green cover off.

2655
03:25:52,840 --> 03:25:54,840
Yeah, I know he has the brooch, but so?

2656
03:25:54,840 --> 03:25:59,639
You ever tie up any of your victims, Eli?

2657
03:25:59,639 --> 03:26:01,639
You ever tie up any of your victims, Eli?

2658
03:26:01,639 --> 03:26:03,809
It's not a nice thing to go calling them.

2659
03:26:03,809 --> 03:26:06,180
What would you call them?

2660
03:26:06,180 --> 03:26:08,479
Calling them.

2661
03:26:08,479 --> 03:26:11,239
I can't say.

2662
03:26:11,239 --> 03:26:13,239
I learned a long time ago not to go talking about the things I like.

2663
03:26:13,239 --> 03:26:15,239
What?

2664
03:26:15,239 --> 03:26:17,239
Talking about it just seems to get people's dander up.

2665
03:26:17,239 --> 03:26:19,239
Answer the goddamn question, Rudy, before I brain you.

2666
03:26:19,239 --> 03:26:21,239
See what I mean?

2667
03:26:21,239 --> 03:26:23,540
Short answer is yes.

2668
03:26:23,540 --> 03:26:25,540
You have any preference regarding rope, Eli?

2669
03:26:25,540 --> 03:26:27,540
I know a good rope from a bad rope,

2670
03:26:27,540 --> 03:26:29,540
but that's what you mean.

2671
03:26:29,540 --> 03:26:32,229
That's not what you mean, is it?

2672
03:26:32,229 --> 03:26:35,489
Any old rope will do me fine.

2673
03:26:35,489 --> 03:26:39,649
That's not true.

2674
03:26:39,649 --> 03:26:43,750
This is a special rope, right?

2675
03:26:43,750 --> 03:26:53,670
This is a special rope would require

2676
03:26:53,670 --> 03:26:55,670
because it was the braided rope.

2677
03:26:55,670 --> 03:26:57,670
Because it was the braided rope.

2678
03:26:57,670 --> 03:27:20,069
A long boy like you, Eli, must prefer...

2679
03:27:20,069 --> 03:27:22,069
Don't give me the answers! Stop!

2680
03:27:22,069 --> 03:27:24,069
I prefer braids,

2681
03:27:24,069 --> 03:27:26,069
until I hitch a braid.

2682
03:27:26,069 --> 03:27:29,969
Okay, listen.

2683
03:27:29,969 --> 03:27:31,969
You can always tell when I'm like

2684
03:27:31,969 --> 03:27:33,969
nervous and waiting.

2685
03:27:33,969 --> 03:27:35,969
When I think a long time,

2686
03:27:35,969 --> 03:27:37,969
I'm like, what is this jacket? Is it correct?

2687
03:27:37,969 --> 03:27:43,219
What's the motive?

2688
03:27:43,219 --> 03:27:45,219
You killed Mrs. Muller and stole her jewelry.

2689
03:27:45,219 --> 03:27:47,909
That ain't so. Ain't nothing like that.

2690
03:27:47,909 --> 03:27:50,790
Bullshit.

2691
03:27:50,790 --> 03:27:52,790
I can accuse this, right?

2692
03:27:52,790 --> 03:27:57,139
Because of the brooch. He has the brooch.

2693
03:27:57,139 --> 03:28:00,790
He stole the brooch.

2694
03:28:00,790 --> 03:28:02,790
You're a liar, Eli. You needed the money,

2695
03:28:02,790 --> 03:28:05,350
so you killed her.

2696
03:28:05,350 --> 03:28:07,520
I've been around some, son.

2697
03:28:07,520 --> 03:28:09,520
You got some evidence to prove I stole that

2698
03:28:09,520 --> 03:28:11,520
butterfly from that woman?

2699
03:28:11,520 --> 03:28:19,719
I don't think I have evidence of that.

2700
03:28:19,719 --> 03:28:24,520
I done told you I found that pretty thing.

2701
03:28:24,520 --> 03:28:26,819
I never stole it.

2702
03:28:26,819 --> 03:28:35,840
What size boot do you wear, Eli?

2703
03:28:35,840 --> 03:28:37,840
It's all about the feet.

2704
03:28:37,840 --> 03:28:40,719
Kind of like anything I can get my hands on.

2705
03:28:40,719 --> 03:28:42,719
I'm wearing elevens.

2706
03:28:42,719 --> 03:28:45,219
Oh, really? Put them up here.

2707
03:28:45,219 --> 03:28:47,219
There may be five-five, five-six tops.

2708
03:28:47,219 --> 03:28:49,219
And you wear size elevens?

2709
03:28:49,219 --> 03:28:51,219
I don't think so, Eli.

2710
03:28:51,219 --> 03:28:53,219
That might be on the large side.

2711
03:28:53,219 --> 03:28:55,219
Maybe tens. Maybe eights.

2712
03:28:55,219 --> 03:28:57,219
Now that I've come to think of it.

2713
03:28:57,219 --> 03:28:59,219
Why punish children with your iniquity, Eli?

2714
03:28:59,219 --> 03:29:01,840
You think I was never punished?

2715
03:29:01,840 --> 03:29:04,659
You must know what you're doing is evil.

2716
03:29:04,659 --> 03:29:06,899
Well, son.

2717
03:29:06,899 --> 03:29:09,909
Nobody's perfect.

2718
03:29:09,909 --> 03:29:25,440
But, can I look at my book?

2719
03:29:25,440 --> 03:29:27,440
You're as good as done, Mr. Rooney.

2720
03:29:27,440 --> 03:29:29,440
All it will take now is some paperwork.

2721
03:29:29,440 --> 03:29:35,379
What happened? Did I take too long?

2722
03:29:35,379 --> 03:29:48,879
What? Hold on. Wait, wait, wait.

2723
03:29:48,879 --> 03:29:50,879
Did I, I pressed,

2724
03:29:50,879 --> 03:29:52,879
I tried to look at my, I pressed the middle

2725
03:29:52,879 --> 03:29:57,680
PlayStation thing.

2726
03:29:57,680 --> 03:30:06,709
Oh, shit. Okay.

2727
03:30:06,709 --> 03:30:08,709
The other guy has so much evidence against him.

2728
03:30:08,709 --> 03:30:12,229
But he keeps on going like,

2729
03:30:12,229 --> 03:30:14,229
That's what I do and I like it.

2730
03:30:14,229 --> 03:30:16,229
Like, what? How do we, how do I know

2731
03:30:16,229 --> 03:30:18,229
that he's just not murdering other people?

2732
03:30:18,229 --> 03:30:20,600
But the other guy may have murdered.

2733
03:30:20,600 --> 03:30:25,329
Eli Rooney, I'm charging you

2734
03:30:25,329 --> 03:30:27,329
with the first degree murder of Deirdre Muller.

2735
03:30:27,329 --> 03:30:29,329
You don't want to put me back

2736
03:30:29,329 --> 03:30:31,329
if I stir that badly, boy. You go ahead and try.

2737
03:30:31,329 --> 03:30:33,329
It's wrong. I'll beat that rat.

2738
03:30:33,329 --> 03:30:35,329
I ain't a killer. It's wrong.

2739
03:30:35,329 --> 03:30:38,600
Phelps, nice work.

2740
03:30:38,600 --> 03:30:57,860
You fucked it up.

2741
03:30:57,860 --> 03:31:00,420
Did I do it? Is there a, does it tell you

2742
03:31:00,420 --> 03:31:02,420
if you did it wrong?

2743
03:31:02,420 --> 03:31:04,420
Wrong person.

2744
03:31:11,040 --> 03:31:13,040
You lost.

2745
03:31:19,040 --> 03:31:21,860
Did I?

2746
03:31:21,860 --> 03:31:23,860
Will we never know?

2747
03:31:23,860 --> 03:31:33,959
I'll take it.

2748
03:31:33,959 --> 03:31:36,200
That's fine.

2749
03:31:36,200 --> 03:31:41,120
That's a good C minus.

2750
03:31:41,120 --> 03:31:43,120
He was innocent of the murder, but he was a weirdo.

2751
03:31:43,120 --> 03:31:46,200
Hawkeye,

2752
03:31:46,200 --> 03:31:48,200
Hawkeye of mine just came in with

2753
03:31:48,200 --> 03:31:51,780
$35.

2754
03:31:51,780 --> 03:31:53,780
Thank you so much, Hawkeye.

2755
03:31:53,780 --> 03:31:56,020
You say, listen to me, son. I'm your dad.

2756
03:31:56,020 --> 03:31:58,899
Destroy him. Thank you.

2757
03:31:58,899 --> 03:32:01,399
Thank you so much, dude.

2758
03:32:01,399 --> 03:32:18,149
They were both innocent.

2759
03:32:18,149 --> 03:32:20,149
Phelps, we kept your two regular armies.

2760
03:32:20,149 --> 03:32:22,149
Lieutenant, Phelps, we've been over this.

2761
03:32:22,149 --> 03:32:24,149
That sniper barely missed you back on the beach.

2762
03:32:24,149 --> 03:32:26,149
Until the mission is over, there'll be no more saluting

2763
03:32:26,149 --> 03:32:28,149
or signs of rape. I'm in charge here, Medier.

2764
03:32:28,149 --> 03:32:30,149
Do you wish to interrogate the prisoners?

2765
03:32:30,149 --> 03:32:35,200
They're beat.

2766
03:32:35,200 --> 03:32:37,200
Why do they look so sullen?

2767
03:32:37,200 --> 03:32:39,200
Wondering why we haven't killed them yet.

2768
03:32:39,200 --> 03:32:41,200
There's no greater shame than being taken prisoner.

2769
03:32:41,200 --> 03:32:43,200
Get this golden boy. I just seem to

2770
03:32:43,200 --> 03:32:45,200
know what he's doing.

2771
03:32:53,200 --> 03:32:55,200
See that, boys? He slapped that Jap right upside the head.

2772
03:32:55,200 --> 03:32:57,200
General wants us to backseat.

2773
03:32:57,200 --> 03:32:59,200
No, I don't.

2774
03:32:59,200 --> 03:33:01,200
But I do. But I don't.

2775
03:33:01,200 --> 03:33:03,200
I respect the Japanese, Corporal.

2776
03:33:03,200 --> 03:33:05,200
Respect? We're here to kill

2777
03:33:05,200 --> 03:33:07,200
the sons of bitches.

2778
03:33:07,200 --> 03:33:09,200
Do you know why we're fighting the Japanese, Private?

2779
03:33:09,200 --> 03:33:11,200
With respect, sir, these bastards

2780
03:33:11,200 --> 03:33:13,200
attacked Pearl Harbor.

2781
03:33:13,200 --> 03:33:15,200
And why did they attack Pearl, Private?

2782
03:33:15,200 --> 03:33:17,200
Because they hate the US of A

2783
03:33:17,200 --> 03:33:19,200
and our way of life.

2784
03:33:19,200 --> 03:33:21,200
They attacked the US because we cut off their oil.

2785
03:33:21,200 --> 03:33:23,200
What would we do if another country denied us

2786
03:33:23,200 --> 03:33:25,200
the gas to run our cars?

2787
03:33:25,200 --> 03:33:31,600
This is, uh...

2788
03:33:31,600 --> 03:33:36,719
Okay.

2789
03:33:36,719 --> 03:33:39,030
The ship-shocking murder!

2790
03:33:39,030 --> 03:33:49,829
I was just discussing with

2791
03:33:49,829 --> 03:33:51,829
Finbar here how well he would do it.

2792
03:33:51,829 --> 03:33:53,829
I want to eat a shitload of bacon right now.

2793
03:33:53,829 --> 03:33:55,829
A ton of it. Like, way too much for my body

2794
03:33:55,829 --> 03:33:57,829
to handle. I'll get sick.

2795
03:33:57,829 --> 03:33:59,829
What?

2796
03:33:59,829 --> 03:34:01,829
You boys have a new case.

2797
03:34:01,829 --> 03:34:03,829
A poor Hispanic woman murdered near City Hall

2798
03:34:03,829 --> 03:34:05,829
and left lying naked in an alleyway.

2799
03:34:05,829 --> 03:34:08,579
Another naked woman, sir?

2800
03:34:08,579 --> 03:34:10,579
Yes. We seem to have had quite a run

2801
03:34:10,579 --> 03:34:12,579
of them since the Dahlia fiends first struck.

2802
03:34:12,579 --> 03:34:14,579
Phelps is politely trying to hint

2803
03:34:14,579 --> 03:34:16,579
that he thinks the 10th is his hope.

2804
03:34:16,579 --> 03:34:18,579
Well, young folks, you win some

2805
03:34:18,579 --> 03:34:20,579
and you lose some in police work.

2806
03:34:20,579 --> 03:34:22,579
You're happy with the location?

2807
03:34:22,579 --> 03:34:24,579
Over the moon, boys!

2808
03:34:24,579 --> 03:34:26,579
You're happy with the location?

2809
03:34:26,579 --> 03:34:28,579
The witness, the witness,

2810
03:34:28,579 --> 03:34:30,579
and the lack of banana.

2811
03:34:30,579 --> 03:34:34,680
Get out there and catch me another listener.

2812
03:34:47,889 --> 03:34:49,889
Murdered on sandwiches! That's what we're gonna do!

2813
03:34:49,889 --> 03:34:52,520
And then it's gone. All of it.

2814
03:34:52,520 --> 03:34:58,719
Alright, we're gonna have

2815
03:34:58,719 --> 03:35:00,719
another naked murder victim.

2816
03:35:00,719 --> 03:35:03,350
You have the address?

2817
03:35:03,350 --> 03:35:05,350
It's the alley off Aliso

2818
03:35:05,350 --> 03:35:07,350
between Los Angeles and Alameda.

2819
03:35:07,350 --> 03:35:09,350
You're kidding. The next one will be opposite Central Station.

2820
03:35:09,350 --> 03:35:11,350
There's been no random crimes.

2821
03:35:11,350 --> 03:35:13,350
I kind of miss them.

2822
03:35:13,350 --> 03:35:15,350
This is really funny.

2823
03:35:15,350 --> 03:35:17,350
Yeah. It means they can pop in

2824
03:35:17,350 --> 03:35:19,350
to hit the office supply of hooch

2825
03:35:19,350 --> 03:35:21,350
whenever they need it.

2826
03:35:21,350 --> 03:35:23,350
Well, that ain't a bad idea.

2827
03:35:23,350 --> 03:35:25,350
That is not a bad idea at all.

2828
03:35:25,350 --> 03:35:31,430
I was told bacon

2829
03:35:31,430 --> 03:35:33,430
is like the same as turkey.

2830
03:35:33,430 --> 03:35:35,430
Oh, and I spoke too soon.

2831
03:35:37,430 --> 03:35:39,430
Um, but...

2832
03:35:39,430 --> 03:35:44,159
Code 3.

2833
03:35:44,159 --> 03:35:46,159
Turkey, turkey, and bacon are, or they're not

2834
03:35:46,159 --> 03:35:48,159
the same. Turkey is

2835
03:35:48,159 --> 03:35:50,159
turkey and bacon is pig.

2836
03:35:50,159 --> 03:35:52,159
You can get

2837
03:35:52,159 --> 03:35:54,159
turkey bacon, which

2838
03:35:54,159 --> 03:35:56,159
tastes good, kind of like shoe leather,

2839
03:35:56,159 --> 03:35:58,159
but it's kind of like jerky

2840
03:35:58,159 --> 03:36:00,159
in a sense. I like it. I sometimes actually

2841
03:36:00,159 --> 03:36:02,159
prefer it.

2842
03:36:02,159 --> 03:36:05,489
Is this the remaster? Yes, it is.

2843
03:36:05,489 --> 03:36:07,489
This is the one that's on PS4.

2844
03:36:07,489 --> 03:36:17,159
I love turkey bacon.

2845
03:36:17,159 --> 03:36:19,159
I love everything turkey. Turkeys are my favorite meat.

2846
03:36:19,159 --> 03:36:22,229
Turkey burgers, turkey bacon,

2847
03:36:22,229 --> 03:36:24,229
turkey patties,

2848
03:36:24,229 --> 03:36:26,229
turkey dinner, turkey breast,

2849
03:36:26,229 --> 03:36:28,229
turkey jerky.

2850
03:36:28,229 --> 03:36:30,229
All good.

2851
03:36:30,229 --> 03:36:35,409
Whatever. Alright, here comes Kenny.

2852
03:36:35,409 --> 03:36:41,809
Oh my god!

2853
03:36:41,809 --> 03:36:45,200
They killed Kenny!

2854
03:36:51,200 --> 03:36:57,479
Clear the roof!

2855
03:36:57,479 --> 03:37:02,399
Ooh, ooh, ooh, he's going!

2856
03:37:02,399 --> 03:37:18,850
Alright, if I get a headshot, I get to eat as much bacon as I want tonight.

2857
03:37:18,850 --> 03:37:20,850
If I get a headshot, I get to eat as much bacon as I want tonight.

2858
03:37:20,850 --> 03:37:24,440
That's the rule, I didn't make it.

2859
03:37:24,440 --> 03:37:27,059
Headshot, I get to eat as much bacon as I want!

2860
03:37:27,059 --> 03:37:36,469
Yes! I get to eat a ton of

2861
03:37:36,469 --> 03:37:38,770
fucking bacon!

2862
03:37:38,770 --> 03:37:44,579
Mmm!

2863
03:37:44,579 --> 03:37:53,540
Yay! Was I not supposed to kill him?

2864
03:37:53,540 --> 03:38:03,010
I think I was supposed to apprehend him.

2865
03:38:03,010 --> 03:38:06,020
But, would you get some

2866
03:38:06,020 --> 03:38:13,000
bacon out of it?

2867
03:38:13,000 --> 03:38:15,680
Killing somebody for bacon.

2868
03:38:15,680 --> 03:38:17,680
Oh my god, wouldn't you kill for bacon though?

2869
03:38:17,680 --> 03:38:19,680
Epic.

2870
03:38:21,680 --> 03:38:39,600
I hate that word.

2871
03:38:39,600 --> 03:38:41,600
If I could delete a word from the English language,

2872
03:38:41,600 --> 03:38:43,600
it would be epic.

2873
03:38:43,600 --> 03:38:45,600
I would delete it.

2874
03:38:45,600 --> 03:38:54,819
I hate the way it sounds.

2875
03:38:54,819 --> 03:38:56,819
I hate how enthusiastically people say it.

2876
03:38:56,819 --> 03:38:58,819
I hate how

2877
03:38:58,819 --> 03:39:00,819
the word replaces every adjective.

2878
03:39:00,819 --> 03:39:08,290
No.

2879
03:39:08,290 --> 03:39:10,979
I didn't even do that.

2880
03:39:10,979 --> 03:39:22,309
I didn't even do that.

2881
03:39:22,309 --> 03:39:24,309
Epic.

2882
03:39:24,309 --> 03:39:39,399
Epic.

2883
03:39:39,399 --> 03:39:42,020
Epic.

2884
03:39:42,020 --> 03:39:44,319
Epic.

2885
03:39:44,319 --> 03:39:46,559
Epic.

2886
03:39:46,559 --> 03:39:49,440
Epic.

2887
03:39:49,440 --> 03:39:51,940
Epic.

2888
03:39:51,940 --> 03:39:53,940
Epic.

2889
03:39:53,940 --> 03:40:02,450
Epic.

2890
03:40:02,450 --> 03:40:08,209
Epic.

2891
03:40:08,209 --> 03:40:10,209
After the cutscene.

2892
03:40:12,520 --> 03:40:14,520
Why is someone naked?

2893
03:40:14,520 --> 03:40:16,520
No one naked.

2894
03:40:16,520 --> 03:40:18,520
Stop killing people and making them be naked!

2895
03:40:18,520 --> 03:40:20,760
Stop this!

2896
03:40:20,760 --> 03:40:22,760
Anyways, look. Let me just show you

2897
03:40:22,760 --> 03:40:25,700
what I'm talking about here.

2898
03:40:25,700 --> 03:40:27,940
That's all seeds down there.

2899
03:40:27,940 --> 03:40:29,940
You don't want to consume this.

2900
03:40:29,940 --> 03:40:36,079
It's just gross.

2901
03:40:36,079 --> 03:40:38,079
It's only seeds.

2902
03:40:38,079 --> 03:40:45,000
It's like a tiny little pond of liquid.

2903
03:40:45,000 --> 03:40:47,000
I won't do it.

2904
03:40:47,000 --> 03:40:49,000
Hey, Cole.

2905
03:40:49,000 --> 03:40:51,000
Let's get moving.

2906
03:41:02,899 --> 03:41:04,899
The lacerations on the neck

2907
03:41:04,899 --> 03:41:06,899
would indicate a great deal of force.

2908
03:41:16,260 --> 03:41:18,629
Only 21 years old.

2909
03:41:18,629 --> 03:41:20,629
But why the library card?

2910
03:41:20,629 --> 03:41:22,629
Did he want us to find it?

2911
03:41:22,629 --> 03:41:27,940
Kiss the blood, BD.

2912
03:41:34,040 --> 03:41:39,159
Other arm.

2913
03:41:39,159 --> 03:41:41,159
Another wedding ring.

2914
03:41:41,159 --> 03:41:43,459
Another wedding ring torn from the finger.

2915
03:41:43,459 --> 03:41:49,350
No skin under the fingernails.

2916
03:41:49,350 --> 03:41:54,069
Okay, good.

2917
03:41:54,069 --> 03:41:57,079
That's it.

2918
03:41:57,079 --> 03:41:59,079
The evidence in the Mueller case was solid.

2919
03:41:59,079 --> 03:42:01,079
I'm not convinced about Mendez.

2920
03:42:01,079 --> 03:42:03,079
The best way to get away with murder is to pin it on somebody else.

2921
03:42:03,079 --> 03:42:05,079
I'll bet a month's salary this is a copycat.

2922
03:42:05,079 --> 03:42:07,079
Strangle, battered, naked.

2923
03:42:07,079 --> 03:42:09,079
Yeah, yeah, yeah. We know the MO.

2924
03:42:09,079 --> 03:42:11,079
So does every jerk who kills his wife and girlfriend

2925
03:42:11,079 --> 03:42:13,079
looking for a way out.

2926
03:42:13,079 --> 03:42:15,319
I've spoken to Brown.

2927
03:42:15,319 --> 03:42:17,319
He still believes the Dahlia perp has medical experience.

2928
03:42:17,319 --> 03:42:19,319
Four women, all murdered,

2929
03:42:19,319 --> 03:42:21,319
all put on display,

2930
03:42:21,319 --> 03:42:23,319
all with messages.

2931
03:42:23,319 --> 03:42:25,319
Mueller had no message.

2932
03:42:25,319 --> 03:42:27,319
Look, Phelps, this is getting us nowhere.

2933
03:42:27,319 --> 03:42:29,319
Anything for us to go on, Mel?

2934
03:42:29,319 --> 03:42:31,319
Head injuries from contact with road,

2935
03:42:31,319 --> 03:42:33,319
bruising from a small man's shoe,

2936
03:42:33,319 --> 03:42:35,319
further blunt force trauma to the occipital region

2937
03:42:35,319 --> 03:42:37,319
at the base of the skull.

2938
03:42:37,319 --> 03:42:39,319
Could have been fatal, but

2939
03:42:39,319 --> 03:42:41,319
clear signs of strangulation would seem to rule it out.

2940
03:42:41,319 --> 03:42:43,319
Break the seeds.

2941
03:42:43,319 --> 03:42:45,319
I'm going for it.

2942
03:42:45,319 --> 03:42:47,319
I'll see if I can nail down a brand.

2943
03:42:47,319 --> 03:42:56,469
Don't look over here.

2944
03:42:56,469 --> 03:43:10,360
If she took a blow to the head like the others,

2945
03:43:10,360 --> 03:43:12,360
she was probably unconscious when strangled.

2946
03:43:12,360 --> 03:43:14,360
Okay.

2947
03:43:14,360 --> 03:43:22,850
Fucking epic.

2948
03:43:22,850 --> 03:43:25,409
Is that it? Wait.

2949
03:43:25,409 --> 03:43:30,850
What is it?

2950
03:43:30,850 --> 03:43:37,379
May as well follow the trail.

2951
03:43:37,379 --> 03:43:43,139
Do I need to walk there or what?

2952
03:43:43,139 --> 03:43:57,159
Antonio.

2953
03:43:57,159 --> 03:43:59,159
Same as the library card.

2954
03:43:59,159 --> 03:44:10,469
Okay. That's it.

2955
03:44:10,469 --> 03:44:15,510
Wait, what are you looking at? My help?

2956
03:44:15,510 --> 03:44:26,629
All right, that's it.

2957
03:44:26,629 --> 03:44:31,299
There's blood all over the door.

2958
03:44:31,299 --> 03:44:33,479
Did somebody shot a gun? What was that?

2959
03:44:33,479 --> 03:44:37,239
Oh, he took a picture.

2960
03:44:37,239 --> 03:44:40,309
Nothing in trash cans.

2961
03:44:40,309 --> 03:44:48,930
All right. Wait. Matches.

2962
03:44:48,930 --> 03:44:52,389
Matches are never anything. Ever.

2963
03:44:52,389 --> 03:45:09,280
It's never matches.

2964
03:45:09,280 --> 03:45:11,280
I still feel these seeds in my mouth.

2965
03:45:11,280 --> 03:45:13,280
I'm going to have to go fucking throw up.

2966
03:45:13,280 --> 03:45:16,340
It's rust.

2967
03:45:16,340 --> 03:45:25,680
They're in my teeth.

2968
03:45:25,680 --> 03:45:27,680
It's bad.

2969
03:45:27,680 --> 03:45:32,870
I'm going to smoke blood.

2970
03:45:32,870 --> 03:45:36,959
Okay. Drink water?

2971
03:45:36,959 --> 03:45:38,959
I don't have any water up here. Only seeds.

2972
03:45:38,959 --> 03:45:49,760
Shoo.

2973
03:45:49,760 --> 03:45:51,760
Proximity to the scene plus the blood stains.

2974
03:45:51,760 --> 03:45:53,760
No way is this coincidence.

2975
03:45:53,760 --> 03:45:57,989
Okay.

2976
03:45:57,989 --> 03:46:00,290
Shoo on head.

2977
03:46:00,290 --> 03:46:02,290
I better put this on my head or chat will think it's pre-recorded.

2978
03:46:02,290 --> 03:46:09,520
On it goes.

2979
03:46:09,520 --> 03:46:19,360
With a gun.

2980
03:46:19,360 --> 03:46:21,360
We kept the area pristine for you boys.

2981
03:46:21,360 --> 03:46:23,360
Let's check it out. No pocket.

2982
03:46:23,360 --> 03:46:26,819
Wait, there's a TV dinner over here.

2983
03:46:26,819 --> 03:46:37,239
Nothing.

2984
03:46:37,239 --> 03:46:44,530
Oh, there is a...

2985
03:46:44,530 --> 03:46:46,530
What is this?

2986
03:46:46,530 --> 03:46:51,459
Five house keys

2987
03:46:51,459 --> 03:46:53,459
strung up like bait on a hook.

2988
03:46:53,459 --> 03:47:03,120
That's a huge crime scene.

2989
03:47:03,120 --> 03:47:05,120
Any more blood?

2990
03:47:05,120 --> 03:47:07,120
Blood.

2991
03:47:07,120 --> 03:47:11,350
Blood. Blood.

2992
03:47:11,350 --> 03:47:18,200
It's got to be a code or a cipher.

2993
03:47:18,200 --> 03:47:20,690
Two five three.

2994
03:47:20,690 --> 03:47:22,690
Two five three.

2995
03:47:22,690 --> 03:47:33,299
Memorize that.

2996
03:47:33,299 --> 03:47:38,040
Okay. Climbed about here.

2997
03:47:38,040 --> 03:47:40,040
Where are you taking us?

2998
03:47:40,040 --> 03:47:42,659
Okay. To the roof we go.

2999
03:47:42,659 --> 03:47:47,270
What is on the roof?

3000
03:47:47,270 --> 03:47:54,049
That was record time.

3001
03:47:54,049 --> 03:47:56,049
That was record roof time.

3002
03:47:56,049 --> 03:48:03,540
Blood.

3003
03:48:03,540 --> 03:48:09,989
Blood?

3004
03:48:09,989 --> 03:48:13,639
Blood in the birdcage.

3005
03:48:13,639 --> 03:48:15,639
Now that sounds like a title of a great movie.

3006
03:48:15,639 --> 03:48:22,340
Blood in the birdcage.

3007
03:48:22,340 --> 03:48:24,520
Okay. Mrs. A Maldonado.

3008
03:48:24,520 --> 03:48:30,340
Federal offense.

3009
03:48:30,340 --> 03:48:32,579
Empty.

3010
03:48:32,579 --> 03:48:34,579
Where is all of this meant to be taking us?

3011
03:48:34,579 --> 03:48:39,059
Okay.

3012
03:48:39,059 --> 03:48:41,059
He clearly wants us to find these things.

3013
03:48:41,059 --> 03:48:44,260
He left them for us.

3014
03:48:44,260 --> 03:48:46,260
There you go, Felt. You got a new M.O.

3015
03:48:46,260 --> 03:48:48,260
I told you it would. More blood.

3016
03:48:48,260 --> 03:48:50,260
Or he might just be getting more confident.

3017
03:48:50,260 --> 03:48:57,030
A D.S.

3018
03:48:57,030 --> 03:48:59,030
What do you got on here? An amald and gold plated.

3019
03:48:59,030 --> 03:49:01,030
This was precious to her.

3020
03:49:01,030 --> 03:49:11,250
Can I do anything with this?

3021
03:49:11,250 --> 03:49:15,090
I guess not.

3022
03:49:15,090 --> 03:49:20,850
The trail points up.

3023
03:49:20,850 --> 03:49:22,850
New Super Barrio Brothers D.S.

3024
03:49:22,850 --> 03:49:26,629
Who has this much blood?

3025
03:49:26,629 --> 03:49:29,190
You would have died

3026
03:49:29,190 --> 03:49:31,190
two pipes ago.

3027
03:49:31,190 --> 03:49:36,760
Oh look, another

3028
03:49:36,760 --> 03:49:38,760
wedding ring.

3029
03:49:38,760 --> 03:49:40,760
I'm the wedding ring killer.

3030
03:49:40,760 --> 03:49:43,319
I kill people

3031
03:49:43,319 --> 03:49:45,319
and take off their wedding ring.

3032
03:49:45,319 --> 03:49:49,540
Find me if you can.

3033
03:49:49,540 --> 03:50:06,690
Looks as though the killer was

3034
03:50:06,690 --> 03:50:08,690
decorating with this.

3035
03:50:10,690 --> 03:50:12,690
He's just a sick fuck.

3036
03:50:12,690 --> 03:50:15,120
This is the end of the trail.

3037
03:50:15,120 --> 03:50:23,750
Red bag.

3038
03:50:23,750 --> 03:50:26,239
The other half.

3039
03:50:26,239 --> 03:50:29,379
May 19th, 1929.

3040
03:50:37,219 --> 03:50:43,040
Okay, well we have an address.

3041
03:50:43,040 --> 03:50:45,040
I think that's the end of the trail.

3042
03:50:45,040 --> 03:50:48,760
Yeah, it kind of has to be.

3043
03:50:48,760 --> 03:50:57,840
Bag secured.

3044
03:50:57,840 --> 03:50:59,840
Whoa, that scared the shit out of me.

3045
03:50:59,840 --> 03:51:04,770
God.

3046
03:51:04,770 --> 03:51:09,680
That was like an explosion.

3047
03:51:13,680 --> 03:51:15,680
I'm going to pee again.

3048
03:51:15,680 --> 03:51:17,680
I'm going to be pissing out C.

3049
03:51:33,680 --> 03:51:37,639
Imagine if we didn't have

3050
03:51:37,639 --> 03:51:39,639
intestines and a

3051
03:51:39,639 --> 03:51:42,389
stomach and everything that could

3052
03:51:42,389 --> 03:51:44,389
process all this shit.

3053
03:51:44,389 --> 03:51:47,590
Pissing out, fucking solid.

3054
03:51:47,590 --> 03:51:53,280
Gone.

3055
03:51:53,280 --> 03:52:07,559
Yeah, imagine if you didn't have a stomach.

3056
03:52:07,559 --> 03:52:09,559
No, no, no, not a stomach, but just the way that it separates it.

3057
03:52:09,559 --> 03:52:11,559
You guys don't realize, your body

3058
03:52:11,559 --> 03:52:13,559
is a gigantic coin separation

3059
03:52:13,559 --> 03:52:15,559
machine. You know when those old machines

3060
03:52:15,559 --> 03:52:17,559
you put in the dime, the nickel, the quarter

3061
03:52:17,559 --> 03:52:19,559
and it would go, and put it in the right slot?

3062
03:52:19,559 --> 03:52:21,559
If your body didn't have one of those down

3063
03:52:21,559 --> 03:52:23,559
there, you'd be in a lot of trouble.

3064
03:52:23,559 --> 03:52:28,549
But the weird thing though is, even those

3065
03:52:28,549 --> 03:52:30,549
machines, sometimes you'd put like a penny in

3066
03:52:30,549 --> 03:52:32,549
and it would fuck up and go in the quarter slot.

3067
03:52:32,549 --> 03:52:34,549
So why are our bodies so good at it?

3068
03:52:34,549 --> 03:52:37,879
How come a nickel

3069
03:52:37,879 --> 03:52:39,879
doesn't go into the dime slot sometimes?

3070
03:52:39,879 --> 03:52:41,879
If you catch my drift.

3071
03:52:41,879 --> 03:52:56,200
Sometimes I read

3072
03:52:56,200 --> 03:52:58,200
the one comment that makes me laugh.

3073
03:52:58,200 --> 03:53:01,079
Are you this stupid on purpose?

3074
03:53:18,469 --> 03:53:21,219
I'm here. Which one's Kenny?

3075
03:53:26,229 --> 03:53:28,229
Well, Kenny's not here.

3076
03:53:28,229 --> 03:53:30,229
It's not the default police officer.

3077
03:53:30,229 --> 03:53:32,229
I'm losing my weekly cake to you punks.

3078
03:53:32,229 --> 03:53:35,360
Kenny's not in this scene.

3079
03:53:35,360 --> 03:53:52,000
Damn it, they went down there.

3080
03:53:52,000 --> 03:53:54,629
What the fuck?

3081
03:53:59,430 --> 03:54:06,079
$30 suit bullshit.

3082
03:54:06,079 --> 03:54:12,040
Down again.

3083
03:54:12,040 --> 03:54:14,979
House flipper. It really is

3084
03:54:14,979 --> 03:54:16,979
the house flipper bunker, isn't it?

3085
03:54:16,979 --> 03:54:19,280
Whoa!

3086
03:54:19,280 --> 03:54:25,680
Alright, the last guy I'm gonna punch.

3087
03:54:25,680 --> 03:54:28,690
I wanna subdue the last one.

3088
03:54:28,690 --> 03:54:35,090
Gotta reload, he's gotta reload!

3089
03:54:35,090 --> 03:54:37,270
How do I tackle him?

3090
03:54:37,270 --> 03:54:50,520
I tried to hit X, X is usually tackle.

3091
03:54:50,520 --> 03:54:55,000
We're getting bacon tonight!

3092
03:54:55,000 --> 03:54:57,620
It's time to eat

3093
03:54:57,620 --> 03:54:59,620
lots of bacon!

3094
03:55:03,620 --> 03:55:05,620
Code four.

3095
03:55:07,620 --> 03:55:09,620
Code four.

3096
03:55:09,620 --> 03:55:21,590
So the guy did die.

3097
03:55:23,590 --> 03:55:34,520
Do you guys eat

3098
03:55:34,520 --> 03:55:36,520
eggs in one bite?

3099
03:55:36,520 --> 03:55:38,520
Or do you cut them up and let all the fucking goo go everywhere?

3100
03:55:38,520 --> 03:55:41,459
You go to a breakfast place

3101
03:55:41,459 --> 03:55:43,459
and you order, oh, two sunny side up eggs

3102
03:55:43,459 --> 03:55:45,459
or two over easy, whatever.

3103
03:55:47,459 --> 03:55:52,260
You do it, you cut it up and

3104
03:55:52,260 --> 03:55:55,719
you just eat the whole thing.

3105
03:55:57,719 --> 03:55:59,719
Typically what I like to do, I like to

3106
03:55:59,719 --> 03:56:01,719
separate it. I don't really like to have the yolk

3107
03:56:01,719 --> 03:56:03,719
and all of the other stuff.

3108
03:56:03,719 --> 03:56:05,719
So I'll drop like two or three drops of Tabasco sauce.

3109
03:56:05,719 --> 03:56:07,719
A little bit of salt and pepper

3110
03:56:07,719 --> 03:56:09,719
and the whole thing.

3111
03:56:09,719 --> 03:56:11,719
Just one whole egg, just gone.

3112
03:56:11,719 --> 03:56:19,520
Enjoy it.

3113
03:56:23,879 --> 03:56:25,879
Same, same, one bite, yeah.

3114
03:56:25,879 --> 03:56:27,879
That's disgusting, what?

3115
03:56:27,879 --> 03:56:29,879
You think like 30%

3116
03:56:29,879 --> 03:56:31,879
of the audience here is disgusting.

3117
03:56:31,879 --> 03:56:35,459
What do you mean, what are these topics?

3118
03:56:35,459 --> 03:56:37,459
We're talking about bacon! We just had a huge conversation

3119
03:56:37,459 --> 03:56:39,459
about getting bacon.

3120
03:56:39,459 --> 03:56:41,459
So I'm pivoting the conversation

3121
03:56:41,459 --> 03:56:43,459
to talk about breakfast because bacon and breakfast

3122
03:56:43,459 --> 03:56:45,459
and eggs is what goes together.

3123
03:56:45,459 --> 03:56:47,459
Guys, we're driving around.

3124
03:56:47,459 --> 03:56:49,459
I gotta think of something to talk about.

3125
03:56:49,459 --> 03:56:51,459
It's gonna be bacon, eggs, and toast!

3126
03:56:51,459 --> 03:57:03,219
Weirdos.

3127
03:57:03,219 --> 03:57:05,219
I wasn't even close.

3128
03:57:05,219 --> 03:57:07,219
I wasn't even close. I wasn't. I just wasn't even close.

3129
03:57:07,219 --> 03:57:09,649
That lady ate shit

3130
03:57:09,649 --> 03:57:19,319
and I didn't do anything.

3131
03:57:19,319 --> 03:57:21,319
Ready your dad.

3132
03:57:21,319 --> 03:57:26,870
I'm sick of this.

3133
03:57:26,870 --> 03:57:30,959
Oh old lady,

3134
03:57:30,959 --> 03:57:32,959
hello officers, it's so

3135
03:57:32,959 --> 03:57:34,959
beautiful to see you. I did it.

3136
03:57:34,959 --> 03:57:39,750
She did it.

3137
03:57:45,750 --> 03:57:47,989
I'm Mrs. Barbara Lepente, the owner of this

3138
03:57:47,989 --> 03:57:49,989
boarding house. Is there a problem?

3139
03:57:49,989 --> 03:57:51,989
I'm afraid so, ma'am.

3140
03:57:51,989 --> 03:57:53,989
Do you mind if we come in? Is there somewhere we can discuss this?

3141
03:57:53,989 --> 03:57:55,989
Of course.

3142
03:57:55,989 --> 03:57:59,569
Follow me through to the parlor.

3143
03:57:59,569 --> 03:58:01,569
Wap your feet as you come in, detectives.

3144
03:58:01,569 --> 03:58:06,879
It's this way.

3145
03:58:06,879 --> 03:58:08,879
Sorry, I'm gonna walk dirt all over her house. Fuck this lady.

3146
03:58:08,879 --> 03:58:10,879
Mrs. Maldonado was found

3147
03:58:10,879 --> 03:58:12,879
dead this morning.

3148
03:58:12,879 --> 03:58:15,190
Dead? Oh no!

3149
03:58:15,190 --> 03:58:17,190
She can't be.

3150
03:58:17,190 --> 03:58:19,190
I'm afraid she was murdered, ma'am.

3151
03:58:19,190 --> 03:58:21,190
Let's take a look at her things.

3152
03:58:21,190 --> 03:58:23,190
I can't believe it.

3153
03:58:23,190 --> 03:58:25,190
A person seems so alive

3154
03:58:25,190 --> 03:58:29,079
and then they're gone.

3155
03:58:29,079 --> 03:58:31,079
Antonia's room is upstairs,

3156
03:58:31,079 --> 03:58:33,079
last door on the left.

3157
03:58:33,079 --> 03:58:35,079
Thank you. We'll be back shortly.

3158
03:58:35,079 --> 03:58:37,079
Excuse us

3159
03:58:37,079 --> 03:58:43,479
a moment, ma'am.

3160
03:58:43,479 --> 03:59:01,459
Room is upstairs.

3161
03:59:01,459 --> 03:59:04,319
You look at that?

3162
03:59:04,319 --> 03:59:06,319
Someone's turned the place over.

3163
03:59:06,319 --> 03:59:08,319
Another broken window.

3164
03:59:08,319 --> 03:59:10,319
A smashed window explains why the place looks tossed.

3165
03:59:10,319 --> 03:59:13,780
Iron picket broken window.

3166
03:59:13,780 --> 03:59:15,780
This person smashes windows.

3167
03:59:17,780 --> 03:59:20,600
Shoo.

3168
03:59:20,600 --> 03:59:22,600
That doesn't matter anymore, does it?

3169
03:59:22,600 --> 03:59:27,809
An auto.

3170
03:59:27,809 --> 03:59:32,739
Another envelope.

3171
03:59:32,739 --> 03:59:36,129
That was a lot of reading.

3172
03:59:36,129 --> 03:59:38,129
Further to my previous correspondence,

3173
03:59:38,129 --> 03:59:40,129
I'm writing to inform you that your petition to the Superior Court

3174
03:59:40,129 --> 03:59:42,129
of the State of California has been accepted

3175
03:59:42,129 --> 03:59:44,129
in a court date scheduled.

3176
03:59:44,129 --> 03:59:46,129
Your case, document number 985,

3177
03:59:46,129 --> 03:59:48,129
will be heard on September 17th.

3178
03:59:48,129 --> 03:59:50,129
Your husband, Angel Christopher Maldano,

3179
03:59:50,129 --> 03:59:52,129
residing at 30433

3180
03:59:52,129 --> 03:59:54,129
N Hills 3, Los Angeles,

3181
03:59:54,129 --> 03:59:56,129
California, has been served with the official

3182
03:59:56,129 --> 03:59:58,129
papers and is on notice to appear at the Central District Court

3183
03:59:58,129 --> 04:00:01,520
Okay.

3184
04:00:01,520 --> 04:00:03,520
Alright, buddy. Thank you.

3185
04:00:03,520 --> 04:00:05,520
On the date above, though it is not essential

3186
04:00:05,520 --> 04:00:07,520
and many women in your position choose not to do so,

3187
04:00:07,520 --> 04:00:09,959
I would advise you also

3188
04:00:09,959 --> 04:00:11,959
to appear at the Central District Court on the scheduled date.

3189
04:00:11,959 --> 04:00:13,959
In my experience,

3190
04:00:13,959 --> 04:00:15,959
a woman plaintiff's presence in cases like this

3191
04:00:15,959 --> 04:00:17,959
one can do much to influence proceedings.

3192
04:00:17,959 --> 04:00:19,959
And if your husband does not appear on September 17th,

3193
04:00:19,959 --> 04:00:21,959
which you have told me is likely,

3194
04:00:21,959 --> 04:00:23,959
then it can only help your

3195
04:00:23,959 --> 04:00:25,959
our chances.

3196
04:00:25,959 --> 04:00:27,959
You are sincerely

3197
04:00:27,959 --> 04:00:32,239
my signature.

3198
04:00:32,239 --> 04:00:34,239
We gotta see granny's feet

3199
04:00:34,239 --> 04:00:46,149
before we reach a conclusion.

3200
04:00:46,149 --> 04:00:48,149
Charm bracelet wasn't among the crime scene

3201
04:00:48,149 --> 04:00:51,030
evidence.

3202
04:00:51,030 --> 04:01:01,399
So it means it was taken.

3203
04:01:01,399 --> 04:01:03,959
We still can't read cursive?

3204
04:01:03,959 --> 04:01:16,229
Can you?

3205
04:01:16,229 --> 04:01:18,229
Alright, now what?

3206
04:01:18,229 --> 04:01:20,229
Oh, I guess this is like a, nevermind, okay.

3207
04:01:20,229 --> 04:01:24,000
Well, we have some questions, ma'am.

3208
04:01:24,000 --> 04:01:26,000
If you're up to it.

3209
04:01:26,000 --> 04:01:28,440
Yes, detective. I'll do my best.

3210
04:01:28,440 --> 04:01:30,610
Why are you so

3211
04:01:30,610 --> 04:01:32,610
stupid to not hear somebody breaking into your

3212
04:01:32,610 --> 04:01:34,610
room upstairs? What are you, out of your

3213
04:01:34,610 --> 04:01:38,709
mind?

3214
04:01:38,709 --> 04:01:40,709
Do you have any idea who might have wanted to hurt

3215
04:01:40,709 --> 04:01:42,709
Mrs. Maldonado?

3216
04:01:42,709 --> 04:01:44,709
That ride of her husband, Angel.

3217
04:01:44,709 --> 04:01:47,079
She was serving him divorce papers.

3218
04:01:47,079 --> 04:01:49,079
If I killed every wife that served me

3219
04:01:49,079 --> 04:01:51,079
papers, I'd be a mass murderer.

3220
04:01:51,079 --> 04:01:53,079
Are you being flippant, young man?

3221
04:01:53,079 --> 04:01:58,260
No, ma'am.

3222
04:01:58,260 --> 04:02:00,260
I mean, she's got stone

3223
04:02:00,260 --> 04:02:02,260
cold lock-on gaze here. I don't

3224
04:02:02,260 --> 04:02:04,260
believe her. What can you tell us about

3225
04:02:04,260 --> 04:02:06,760
Angel Maldonado?

3226
04:02:06,760 --> 04:02:08,760
She married him when she was 17.

3227
04:02:08,760 --> 04:02:11,250
He was cruel to her.

3228
04:02:11,250 --> 04:02:14,319
Very cruel. She was a good

3229
04:02:14,319 --> 04:02:16,319
girl. Little on the religious

3230
04:02:16,319 --> 04:02:18,319
side, but a good girl.

3231
04:02:18,319 --> 04:02:21,270
Stone cold Steve Austin.

3232
04:02:21,270 --> 04:02:23,639
Movements of victim.

3233
04:02:23,639 --> 04:02:34,319
What time did Antonia

3234
04:02:34,319 --> 04:02:36,319
go out yesterday?

3235
04:02:36,319 --> 04:02:38,319
She left around 9.

3236
04:02:38,319 --> 04:02:41,399
Do you know where she went? No.

3237
04:02:41,399 --> 04:02:44,079
I have no idea. She was a good

3238
04:02:44,079 --> 04:02:48,559
girl, but she didn't invite me.

3239
04:02:48,559 --> 04:02:50,559
Oh, your stone cold gaze

3240
04:02:50,559 --> 04:02:52,559
has suddenly turned into

3241
04:02:52,559 --> 04:02:54,559
point eyes down.

3242
04:02:54,559 --> 04:02:56,799
A nosy old hag

3243
04:02:56,799 --> 04:02:58,799
like you knows everything about the people who live

3244
04:02:58,799 --> 04:03:00,799
under her roof. Where did she go?

3245
04:03:00,799 --> 04:03:02,799
I think she went to a bar.

3246
04:03:02,799 --> 04:03:06,200
She's been drinking quite a lot lately.

3247
04:03:06,200 --> 04:03:08,200
This bar have a name?

3248
04:03:08,200 --> 04:03:10,690
El Dorado Bar. Got it.

3249
04:03:10,690 --> 04:03:12,690
Latino place on North Los Angeles

3250
04:03:12,690 --> 04:03:14,690
Street. That's only a couple of blocks

3251
04:03:14,690 --> 04:03:16,690
from where we found the body.

3252
04:03:16,690 --> 04:03:19,250
Evidence of break-in.

3253
04:03:19,250 --> 04:03:21,250
You've had a break-in?

3254
04:03:21,250 --> 04:03:24,000
No!

3255
04:03:24,000 --> 04:03:26,239
No!

3256
04:03:26,239 --> 04:03:28,239
No!

3257
04:03:28,239 --> 04:03:30,739
Wait, did she just not know?

3258
04:03:30,739 --> 04:03:37,010
Antonia's rear

3259
04:03:37,010 --> 04:03:39,010
window smashed glass and damaged a frame.

3260
04:03:39,010 --> 04:03:46,950
Maybe she really is just like an

3261
04:03:46,950 --> 04:03:54,950
old lady and can't hear it.

3262
04:03:54,950 --> 04:03:56,950
This is her.

3263
04:03:56,950 --> 04:03:58,950
What do you have to hide?

3264
04:03:58,950 --> 04:04:00,950
I have no idea what you are talking about.

3265
04:04:00,950 --> 04:04:07,540
So Antonia lost her keys

3266
04:04:07,540 --> 04:04:09,540
and used an iron bar to jimmy the back window?

3267
04:04:09,540 --> 04:04:13,000
I heard a noise in the

3268
04:04:13,000 --> 04:04:15,000
early hours of the morning.

3269
04:04:15,000 --> 04:04:17,000
I thought it might be a raccoon at the milk bottles.

3270
04:04:17,000 --> 04:04:21,409
It'd be very bad

3271
04:04:21,409 --> 04:04:23,409
for business if this news got out.

3272
04:04:23,409 --> 04:04:25,409
For reputation to protect.

3273
04:04:25,409 --> 04:04:31,360
Antonia and her husband

3274
04:04:31,360 --> 04:04:33,360
were estranged?

3275
04:04:33,360 --> 04:04:35,860
Yes. She moved

3276
04:04:35,860 --> 04:04:37,860
here after she separated from her

3277
04:04:37,860 --> 04:04:39,860
husband two months ago.

3278
04:04:39,860 --> 04:04:41,860
But Antonia still wore a wedding ring?

3279
04:04:41,860 --> 04:04:43,860
She wore the wedding ring

3280
04:04:43,860 --> 04:04:45,860
and a necklace.

3281
04:04:45,860 --> 04:04:47,860
She always wore a religious

3282
04:04:47,860 --> 04:04:50,870
necklace. That's about all

3283
04:04:50,870 --> 04:04:55,540
of her jewelry.

3284
04:04:55,540 --> 04:05:05,440
That's not a necklace.

3285
04:05:05,440 --> 04:05:07,440
Lady. What about her bracelet?

3286
04:05:07,440 --> 04:05:09,440
I don't know anything about a bracelet.

3287
04:05:09,440 --> 04:05:14,049
Oh, you don't?

3288
04:05:14,049 --> 04:05:16,930
In her wedding photo, she's displaying

3289
04:05:16,930 --> 04:05:20,770
a charm bracelet.

3290
04:05:20,770 --> 04:05:22,770
She never wore it.

3291
04:05:22,770 --> 04:05:24,770
He gave it to her.

3292
04:05:24,770 --> 04:05:26,770
Show his captain that wooden jewelry box.

3293
04:05:26,770 --> 04:05:29,520
Thanks, ma'am.

3294
04:05:29,520 --> 04:05:31,520
Four out of four.

3295
04:05:31,520 --> 04:05:33,520
I got it.

3296
04:05:33,520 --> 04:05:37,430
Lock him up and throw away the key.

3297
04:05:37,430 --> 04:05:39,430
We can either front angel

3298
04:05:39,430 --> 04:05:41,430
seeing as the finger's pointing right at him

3299
04:05:41,430 --> 04:05:45,399
or we can check out the old Aranda one.

3300
04:05:45,399 --> 04:05:51,329
What do you want to do, partner?

3301
04:05:51,329 --> 04:05:53,329
You find him and you throw him away.

3302
04:05:53,329 --> 04:05:57,170
Arrest the grandma

3303
04:05:57,170 --> 04:06:05,040
for lying.

3304
04:06:05,040 --> 04:06:07,040
Residents are the bar.

3305
04:06:07,040 --> 04:06:09,540
We're just going

3306
04:06:09,540 --> 04:06:11,540
in a straight line.

3307
04:06:11,540 --> 04:06:13,540
A nosy old hag?

3308
04:06:13,540 --> 04:06:15,719
And I thought I was coming

3309
04:06:15,719 --> 04:06:17,719
on strong with the ex-wife's line.

3310
04:06:17,719 --> 04:06:19,719
Sometimes you have to be firm to get the information you need.

3311
04:06:19,719 --> 04:06:21,719
Eat the key.

3312
04:06:23,719 --> 04:06:26,979
How about we drop in on the husband instead?

3313
04:06:26,979 --> 04:06:28,979
See if your gut is right.

3314
04:06:28,979 --> 04:06:30,979
I'll take a bar over a husband

3315
04:06:30,979 --> 04:06:32,979
every day of the week.

3316
04:06:32,979 --> 04:06:35,540
Well, that wasn't in the first

3317
04:06:35,540 --> 04:06:37,540
line.

3318
04:06:39,540 --> 04:06:47,479
Cole, come on!

3319
04:06:47,479 --> 04:06:51,319
That isn't a road.

3320
04:06:51,319 --> 04:06:53,620
Goddess here quicker, didn't it?

3321
04:06:57,780 --> 04:06:59,780
Goddess here quicker now, didn't it?

3322
04:06:59,780 --> 04:07:07,969
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

3323
04:07:07,969 --> 04:07:13,600
It's all in cursive.

3324
04:07:13,600 --> 04:07:15,600
His wasn't in cursive.

3325
04:07:15,600 --> 04:07:25,079
I could read it.

3326
04:07:25,079 --> 04:07:28,659
Three, oh, four.

3327
04:07:28,659 --> 04:07:31,159
One, two, three.

3328
04:07:31,159 --> 04:07:33,159
He does the same thing I do.

3329
04:07:33,159 --> 04:07:36,680
Since I was probably like

3330
04:07:36,680 --> 04:07:38,680
twelve, I've never walked up

3331
04:07:38,680 --> 04:07:40,680
the steps one step at a time.

3332
04:07:40,680 --> 04:07:42,850
I always do one, two,

3333
04:07:42,850 --> 04:07:46,049
two steps at a time. Check it.

3334
04:07:46,049 --> 04:07:50,639
Yep. Wait.

3335
04:07:50,639 --> 04:07:55,190
I don't do that.

3336
04:07:55,190 --> 04:07:57,620
That's three, no, that's two.

3337
04:07:57,620 --> 04:08:04,149
I can just feel myself doing it.

3338
04:08:12,739 --> 04:08:14,739
Watch out!

3339
04:08:14,739 --> 04:08:16,920
Watch out!

3340
04:08:16,920 --> 04:08:21,120
Here comes a fight.

3341
04:08:21,120 --> 04:08:33,159
I remember how to fight now.

3342
04:08:37,639 --> 04:08:40,450
What did he say?

3343
04:09:15,090 --> 04:09:17,329
Sit back down.

3344
04:09:22,000 --> 04:09:24,760
Can you please stop getting up?

3345
04:09:24,760 --> 04:09:26,760
Sit down.

3346
04:09:26,760 --> 04:09:29,190
Okay.

3347
04:09:29,190 --> 04:09:31,190
Canvas the Neighbors.

3348
04:09:31,190 --> 04:09:37,139
Let's take a look.

3349
04:09:37,139 --> 04:09:39,139
I didn't.

3350
04:09:39,139 --> 04:09:44,389
Well, see, the problem here, buddy,

3351
04:09:44,389 --> 04:09:48,610
is I didn't get hit once

3352
04:09:48,610 --> 04:09:52,000
and you didn't.

3353
04:09:52,000 --> 04:09:54,000
I didn't.

3354
04:09:54,000 --> 04:09:56,000
I didn't.

3355
04:09:56,000 --> 04:09:58,000
I didn't get hit once and you did.

3356
04:09:58,000 --> 04:10:00,000
You weren't paying attention to my

3357
04:10:00,000 --> 04:10:02,000
flawless victory while you were getting

3358
04:10:02,000 --> 04:10:04,000
stomped on.

3359
04:10:04,000 --> 04:10:08,680
Pay more attention next time.

3360
04:10:08,680 --> 04:10:10,680
Just picked fruit market.

3361
04:10:10,680 --> 04:10:14,770
I wonder if Angel gets all his

3362
04:10:14,770 --> 04:10:17,329
groceries from this place.

3363
04:10:17,329 --> 04:10:20,209
Epic Victory Royale.

3364
04:10:20,209 --> 04:10:29,680
Blood on the shirt.

3365
04:10:29,680 --> 04:10:31,680
In two places. Check this one.

3366
04:10:31,680 --> 04:10:33,680
This will take some explaining.

3367
04:10:33,680 --> 04:10:51,840
Maybe one of the neighbors

3368
04:10:51,840 --> 04:10:53,840
took notice of Angel's movements.

3369
04:10:53,840 --> 04:10:55,840
Got no alibi.

3370
04:10:55,840 --> 04:11:02,549
Neighbor.

3371
04:11:02,549 --> 04:11:07,920
So this is a neighbor.

3372
04:11:07,920 --> 04:11:09,920
Is this the neighbor?

3373
04:11:09,920 --> 04:11:11,920
It's the neighbor.

3374
04:11:11,920 --> 04:11:13,920
We're making some inquiries.

3375
04:11:13,920 --> 04:11:15,920
So you weren't home last night?

3376
04:11:15,920 --> 04:11:17,920
No, I was at work.

3377
04:11:17,920 --> 04:11:19,920
You know nothing about Mrs. Maldonado

3378
04:11:19,920 --> 04:11:21,920
fighting with her husband?

3379
04:11:21,920 --> 04:11:23,920
They're always screaming the place down.

3380
04:11:23,920 --> 04:11:31,200
Thanks.

3381
04:11:31,200 --> 04:11:37,729
Why does it sound like you're talking

3382
04:11:37,729 --> 04:11:40,100
from the bathroom?

3383
04:11:40,100 --> 04:11:56,280
We can't go this way.

3384
04:11:56,280 --> 04:12:13,620
Oh yeah, we can. Come on. Get out of the way.

3385
04:12:13,620 --> 04:12:15,620
Wait, I missed a neighbor?

3386
04:12:15,620 --> 04:12:23,239
I missed a neighbor?

3387
04:12:23,239 --> 04:12:30,340
What are the neighbors? Like down the hall?

3388
04:12:30,340 --> 04:12:35,000
Oh.

3389
04:12:35,000 --> 04:12:37,000
There's 20 people in this building but

3390
04:12:37,000 --> 04:12:39,000
they don't know each other?

3391
04:12:39,000 --> 04:12:46,229
Whoa!

3392
04:12:46,229 --> 04:12:48,229
Sorry about that. I'm playing with my kids.

3393
04:12:48,229 --> 04:12:50,530
LAPD.

3394
04:12:50,530 --> 04:12:52,530
Were you here last night?

3395
04:12:52,530 --> 04:12:54,530
My wife and I

3396
04:12:54,530 --> 04:12:56,530
are separated.

3397
04:12:56,530 --> 04:12:58,530
And I had the kids last night.

3398
04:12:58,530 --> 04:13:00,530
Why are you wearing this fucking mask?

3399
04:13:00,530 --> 04:13:02,530
Thanks.

3400
04:13:02,530 --> 04:13:04,770
Okay.

3401
04:13:04,770 --> 04:13:11,170
Well, there's that.

3402
04:13:11,170 --> 04:13:13,170
He's playing rollercoaster tycoon.

3403
04:13:13,170 --> 04:13:15,170
LAPD. Did you hear a disturbance last night?

3404
04:13:15,170 --> 04:13:17,170
Yes. Yes I did.

3405
04:13:17,170 --> 04:13:19,170
Mrs. Maldonado

3406
04:13:19,170 --> 04:13:21,170
lit out of here and her husband ran out after.

3407
04:13:21,170 --> 04:13:23,170
You saw this, Miss?

3408
04:13:23,170 --> 04:13:25,729
A randa.

3409
04:13:25,729 --> 04:13:27,729
I had the door open a crack.

3410
04:13:27,729 --> 04:13:29,729
Did you see Mr. Maldonado come back inside after he ran out?

3411
04:13:29,729 --> 04:13:32,100
No.

3412
04:13:32,100 --> 04:13:34,100
I didn't.

3413
04:13:34,100 --> 04:13:37,360
Thanks. We'll be in touch.

3414
04:13:37,360 --> 04:13:39,360
I kept thinking you weren't going to call that one a nosy old hag too, Phelps.

3415
04:13:39,360 --> 04:13:41,360
Do you know how much I've sacrificed?

3416
04:13:41,360 --> 04:13:44,180
I'm executing

3417
04:13:44,180 --> 04:13:46,180
restraint right now,

3418
04:13:46,180 --> 04:13:48,739
Finbar.

3419
04:13:48,739 --> 04:14:07,360
Just picked fruit.

3420
04:14:07,360 --> 04:14:20,420
Uh...

3421
04:14:20,420 --> 04:14:22,420
And Francis Langford.

3422
04:14:22,420 --> 04:14:26,319
Yes, for lovely, lustrous hair.

3423
04:14:26,319 --> 04:14:28,319
For all types of hair,

3424
04:14:28,319 --> 04:14:30,319
use green shampoo.

3425
04:14:30,319 --> 04:14:32,319
D-R-E-N-E.

3426
04:14:32,319 --> 04:14:34,319
Green shampoo in the familiar

3427
04:14:34,319 --> 04:14:36,319
blue and yellow package.

3428
04:14:36,319 --> 04:14:38,819
Alright, if I get in a car accident...

3429
04:14:38,819 --> 04:14:40,819
Watch where you're driving, you maniac!

3430
04:14:40,819 --> 04:14:42,819
If I don't get in any car accidents, and even a fender bender,

3431
04:14:42,819 --> 04:14:44,819
then I get to have all the bacon I want tonight.

3432
04:14:44,819 --> 04:15:11,750
Nice.

3433
04:15:11,750 --> 04:15:14,629
Don't ruin your cholesterol.

3434
04:15:14,629 --> 04:15:16,629
I won't. I won't. I won't. I won't.

3435
04:15:16,629 --> 04:15:18,629
What can I get you?

3436
04:15:18,629 --> 04:15:20,629
LAPD. Detectives Phelps and Galloway.

3437
04:15:20,629 --> 04:15:22,629
Diego Aguilar.

3438
04:15:22,629 --> 04:15:24,629
How can I help?

3439
04:15:24,629 --> 04:15:26,629
You were at a bar last night?

3440
04:15:26,629 --> 04:15:28,629
Yeah, being a temp guy from the agency.

3441
04:15:28,629 --> 04:15:30,629
Did you have a woman in here last night?

3442
04:15:30,629 --> 04:15:32,629
21 years old, Hispanic, drinking heavily?

3443
04:15:32,629 --> 04:15:34,629
We have a lot of ladies like that in here.

3444
04:15:34,629 --> 04:15:36,629
But yeah, I know who you mean.

3445
04:15:36,629 --> 04:15:38,629
Antonio Maldonado.

3446
04:15:38,629 --> 04:15:40,629
What did she do?

3447
04:15:40,629 --> 04:15:43,190
She was murdered last night.

3448
04:15:43,190 --> 04:15:45,190
Oh, shit.

3449
04:15:45,190 --> 04:15:47,190
Do you know her well?

3450
04:15:47,190 --> 04:15:49,190
Was she a regular?

3451
04:15:49,190 --> 04:15:51,190
Hell no.

3452
04:15:51,190 --> 04:15:53,190
She was good and tight last night, complaining about her old man.

3453
04:15:53,190 --> 04:15:55,190
Working in a bar.

3454
04:15:55,190 --> 04:15:57,190
She was so hammered last night, she left a letter on the bar.

3455
04:15:57,190 --> 04:15:59,190
More letters.

3456
04:15:59,190 --> 04:16:05,459
I'll show you.

3457
04:16:05,459 --> 04:16:07,459
A waitress. Can I have another spoon?

3458
04:16:07,459 --> 04:16:09,760
Okay.

3459
04:16:09,760 --> 04:16:12,899
Is this one also empty?

3460
04:16:12,899 --> 04:16:20,129
The horse papers.

3461
04:16:20,129 --> 04:16:23,270
Did you open them?

3462
04:16:23,270 --> 04:16:25,270
No need to. She was shouting about it

3463
04:16:25,270 --> 04:16:27,270
and waving the letter around.

3464
04:16:27,270 --> 04:16:30,149
Said she was going to show him.

3465
04:16:30,149 --> 04:16:32,149
Whereas Antonio Maldonado

3466
04:16:32,149 --> 04:16:34,149
did on the 8th day of August,

3467
04:16:34,149 --> 04:16:36,149
1947,

3468
04:16:36,149 --> 04:16:38,149
prefer her petition that she

3469
04:16:38,149 --> 04:16:40,149
might be divorced from the bonds of matrimony

3470
04:16:40,149 --> 04:16:42,149
entered into with you,

3471
04:16:42,149 --> 04:16:44,149
Angel Maldonado.

3472
04:16:44,149 --> 04:16:46,149
Would you therefore command that Angel Maldonado

3473
04:16:46,149 --> 04:16:48,149
that said defend? This is boring.

3474
04:16:48,149 --> 04:16:51,479
You did a bad job with this one.

3475
04:16:51,479 --> 04:17:02,159
What an uncreative mad lid, man.

3476
04:17:02,159 --> 04:17:04,600
Alright.

3477
04:17:04,600 --> 04:17:06,600
Hold on.

3478
04:17:06,600 --> 04:17:10,370
Did you bleed on the trail?

3479
04:17:10,370 --> 04:17:20,549
Can you remember

3480
04:17:20,549 --> 04:17:22,549
what jewelry she was wearing?

3481
04:17:22,549 --> 04:17:24,549
She had a necklace.

3482
04:17:24,549 --> 04:17:26,979
Some kind of religious thing, I think.

3483
04:17:26,979 --> 04:17:28,979
The temp guy would have more of an idea.

3484
04:17:28,979 --> 04:17:30,979
She took the beer he served her and cried

3485
04:17:30,979 --> 04:17:32,979
into it all night.

3486
04:17:32,979 --> 04:17:34,979
What time did she leave?

3487
04:17:34,979 --> 04:17:42,920
Can't say for sure.

3488
04:17:42,920 --> 04:17:44,920
Where did she go?

3489
04:17:44,920 --> 04:17:46,920
Give me something or the LAPD will start getting

3490
04:17:46,920 --> 04:17:48,920
interested in this place.

3491
04:17:48,920 --> 04:17:50,920
Closing squinting his eyes.

3492
04:17:50,920 --> 04:17:53,219
My phone was out of order.

3493
04:17:53,219 --> 04:17:55,219
The closest one I knew was at the fruit market

3494
04:17:55,219 --> 04:17:57,219
across the street, so I suggested she try that.

3495
04:17:57,219 --> 04:17:59,219
Fruit market.

3496
04:17:59,219 --> 04:18:01,219
We have a place, fruit market.

3497
04:18:01,219 --> 04:18:03,219
Did Antonia say

3498
04:18:03,219 --> 04:18:05,219
where she was going when she left?

3499
04:18:05,219 --> 04:18:07,219
She said she was going to serve the papers on the husband.

3500
04:18:07,219 --> 04:18:09,219
Said that would take the smile off

3501
04:18:09,219 --> 04:18:11,719
his face.

3502
04:18:11,719 --> 04:18:13,719
If you ask me, she was scared.

3503
04:18:13,719 --> 04:18:15,719
And the drink was

3504
04:18:15,719 --> 04:18:25,000
for Dutch courage.

3505
04:18:25,000 --> 04:18:27,000
Did she attract any interest?

3506
04:18:27,000 --> 04:18:29,000
An extremely drunk young woman? What do you think?

3507
04:18:29,000 --> 04:18:31,940
She managed to scare them off, though.

3508
04:18:31,940 --> 04:18:33,940
Thanks.

3509
04:18:33,940 --> 04:18:35,940
You've been a big help. Perfect!

3510
04:18:35,940 --> 04:18:38,629
Perfect!

3511
04:18:38,629 --> 04:18:41,319
Hey, get the guy, will you?

3512
04:18:41,319 --> 04:18:43,989
We'll do our best.

3513
04:18:43,989 --> 04:18:45,989
One last question. What size shoe do you take,

3514
04:18:45,989 --> 04:18:48,479
Mr. Aguilar?

3515
04:18:48,479 --> 04:18:50,479
A broad nine. I have wide feet.

3516
04:18:50,479 --> 04:19:02,520
He thinks he's a bit of a gang.

3517
04:19:02,520 --> 04:19:07,489
Okay. Show

3518
04:19:07,489 --> 04:19:15,879
feet.

3519
04:19:15,879 --> 04:19:17,879
Get out of the way. Why would you? Get out of the way!

3520
04:19:17,879 --> 04:19:20,309
Can you?

3521
04:19:20,309 --> 04:19:22,309
Why would you get

3522
04:19:22,309 --> 04:19:24,479
in this way?

3523
04:19:24,479 --> 04:19:27,879
I feel like they're out of a bar still here.

3524
04:19:27,879 --> 04:19:29,879
What? Isn't this where I am?

3525
04:19:29,879 --> 04:19:44,770
Didn't I just do this?

3526
04:19:44,770 --> 04:19:54,559
Uh...

3527
04:20:00,469 --> 04:20:03,670
Out of order.

3528
04:20:05,840 --> 04:20:08,790
Talk to temp guy.

3529
04:20:20,790 --> 04:20:22,790
Give me those feet.

3530
04:20:28,790 --> 04:20:30,959
Where are his feet, Ben?

3531
04:20:30,959 --> 04:20:32,959
Let me see.

3532
04:20:32,959 --> 04:20:34,959
Wait, wait, wait!

3533
04:20:34,959 --> 04:20:37,399
I didn't get your number!

3534
04:20:37,399 --> 04:20:43,030
I saw a telephone.

3535
04:20:43,030 --> 04:20:48,079
Is there anything else to do here?

3536
04:20:48,079 --> 04:20:54,229
Can this be over?

3537
04:20:54,229 --> 04:20:59,920
Do I use the phone?

3538
04:20:59,920 --> 04:21:08,739
Call it in.

3539
04:21:08,739 --> 04:21:22,370
What is happening?

3540
04:21:22,370 --> 04:21:26,600
Detective?

3541
04:21:26,600 --> 04:21:28,600
Where does Hatt go?

3542
04:21:28,600 --> 04:21:39,270
Thanks, ma'am.

3543
04:21:39,270 --> 04:21:41,270
I think his name is Phelps.

3544
04:21:41,270 --> 04:21:45,299
I read about him in the paper.

3545
04:21:45,299 --> 04:21:54,840
You're talking about me?

3546
04:21:54,840 --> 04:21:57,459
Those aren't in this game.

3547
04:21:57,459 --> 04:22:01,360
Sorry, man.

3548
04:22:01,360 --> 04:22:04,629
No, the other Phelps.

3549
04:22:04,629 --> 04:22:08,020
Apparently I'm famous around here from solving

3550
04:22:08,020 --> 04:22:12,690
all these mysteries.

3551
04:22:12,690 --> 04:22:14,690
I'm not actually waiting for him to get in the car

3552
04:22:14,690 --> 04:22:19,680
and then move out of the way, am I?

3553
04:22:19,680 --> 04:22:21,680
You don't think it's strange that all these murders

3554
04:22:21,680 --> 04:22:23,680
are happening to girls who've been out drinking?

3555
04:22:23,680 --> 04:22:25,680
No, no. A broad drinks,

3556
04:22:25,680 --> 04:22:27,680
she gets a bit tired, and she starts mouthing off.

3557
04:22:27,680 --> 04:22:29,680
Is there something I missed in here?

3558
04:22:29,680 --> 04:22:31,680
And she ends up in an alleyway.

3559
04:22:31,680 --> 04:22:33,680
A sad story that this town

3560
04:22:33,680 --> 04:22:35,680
has seen it play out a thousand times, Cole.

3561
04:22:35,680 --> 04:22:37,680
Why don't you want to see a connection here?

3562
04:22:37,680 --> 04:22:39,680
Because there are perfectly good

3563
04:22:39,680 --> 04:22:41,680
real-life suspects

3564
04:22:41,680 --> 04:22:43,680
for every one of these murders.

3565
04:22:43,680 --> 04:22:45,680
We don't need to go looking for the monster

3566
04:22:45,680 --> 04:22:47,680
under the bed.

3567
04:22:47,680 --> 04:22:49,680
Move, I need to turn the other way.

3568
04:22:49,680 --> 04:22:51,680
Another letter? I thought the letter was from a nut.

3569
04:22:53,680 --> 04:22:55,680
These letters?

3570
04:22:55,680 --> 04:22:57,680
There goes the bacon.

3571
04:22:57,680 --> 04:22:59,989
Now we sent another.

3572
04:22:59,989 --> 04:23:02,360
I really hate this fuck.

3573
04:23:02,360 --> 04:23:14,319
Shut. Great.

3574
04:23:14,319 --> 04:23:16,879
We'll need to come back later, Phelps.

3575
04:23:16,879 --> 04:23:18,879
Maybe somebody here saw Antonia

3576
04:23:18,879 --> 04:23:24,709
the night she died.

3577
04:23:24,709 --> 04:23:29,250
I have to come back at night?

3578
04:23:29,250 --> 04:23:31,680
Why don't you get in?

3579
04:23:31,680 --> 04:23:42,930
Okay.

3580
04:23:42,930 --> 04:23:44,930
Back to the police station, then.

3581
04:23:44,930 --> 04:23:57,989
Oh, that's cinematic camera. Okay.

3582
04:23:57,989 --> 04:24:00,290
Alright, if I get in one car accident

3583
04:24:00,290 --> 04:24:02,290
in cinematic camera, then I get all the bacon that I want.

3584
04:24:34,159 --> 04:24:36,159
Did I just...

3585
04:24:36,159 --> 04:24:38,159
Did I just yell...

3586
04:24:38,159 --> 04:24:44,049
He yelled that out the window.

3587
04:24:47,510 --> 04:24:49,510
Why wouldn't you stop me?

3588
04:24:49,510 --> 04:24:55,459
Why wouldn't you stop the car?

3589
04:24:55,459 --> 04:24:57,459
The captain is waiting for you downstairs with anchor.

3590
04:24:57,459 --> 04:25:04,370
The captain's waiting for you downstairs.

3591
04:25:04,370 --> 04:25:08,920
We gonna go downstairs

3592
04:25:08,920 --> 04:25:10,920
and see Donnelly or what?

3593
04:25:10,920 --> 04:25:12,920
There's downstairs room.

3594
04:25:12,920 --> 04:25:14,920
You have to spell it out for me. I don't know.

3595
04:25:14,920 --> 04:25:18,440
I'm receiving hospital this way.

3596
04:25:18,440 --> 04:25:20,680
It doesn't say downstairs room.

3597
04:25:20,680 --> 04:25:22,680
How to get downstairs.

3598
04:25:22,680 --> 04:25:24,680
Isn't that the cop that caught the guy that was pretending to be Donnelly?

3599
04:25:24,680 --> 04:25:39,329
Downstairs. Ooh, now I know where I am.

3600
04:25:39,329 --> 04:25:41,569
What's up? Hey, what's up?

3601
04:25:41,569 --> 04:25:44,200
Phelps, have you met Finnis Brown?

3602
04:25:44,200 --> 04:25:46,200
Pleased to meet you, sir.

3603
04:25:46,200 --> 04:25:48,200
This information is confidential and doesn't leave this room.

3604
04:25:48,200 --> 04:25:50,200
The new letter was left in the back seat of a cab.

3605
04:25:50,200 --> 04:25:52,200
Ow, my elbow.

3606
04:25:52,200 --> 04:25:54,200
The driver thinks it was put through the window and not left by a customer.

3607
04:25:54,200 --> 04:25:56,370
We're checking all the spares back 24 hours, regardless.

3608
04:25:56,370 --> 04:25:58,370
Good.

3609
04:25:58,370 --> 04:26:00,680
Like the previous letters, it's been assembled from headlines

3610
04:26:00,680 --> 04:26:02,680
and typed from the Times and Examiner,

3611
04:26:02,680 --> 04:26:04,680
then glued to an envelope.

3612
04:26:04,680 --> 04:26:06,680
What is the other note?

3613
04:26:06,680 --> 04:26:08,680
This one? That's also new.

3614
04:26:08,680 --> 04:26:10,680
A poem, hand-typed.

3615
04:26:10,680 --> 04:26:12,680
Do you mind if I take a look?

3616
04:26:12,680 --> 04:26:14,680
Go ahead.

3617
04:26:14,680 --> 04:26:16,680
You've been over both documents pretty carefully.

3618
04:26:16,680 --> 04:26:18,680
They've been wiped with gasoline,

3619
04:26:18,680 --> 04:26:20,680
so there's no chance of prints.

3620
04:26:20,680 --> 04:26:24,129
That works.

3621
04:26:24,129 --> 04:26:27,329
Have changed my mind.

3622
04:26:27,329 --> 04:26:29,329
You would not give a square deal.

3623
04:26:29,329 --> 04:26:31,329
Fuck you.

3624
04:26:31,329 --> 04:26:43,409
Buddy.

3625
04:26:43,409 --> 04:26:45,409
Heap upon thy soul by virtue of this curse.

3626
04:26:45,409 --> 04:26:47,409
He'll read it.

3627
04:26:47,409 --> 04:26:50,610
Ill deeds,

3628
04:26:50,610 --> 04:26:52,610
then be thou damned, beholding good,

3629
04:26:52,610 --> 04:26:54,610
both infinite as is the universe,

3630
04:26:54,610 --> 04:26:56,610
and thou and thy self-torturing solitude,

3631
04:26:56,610 --> 04:26:58,610
an awful image of calm power.

3632
04:26:58,610 --> 04:27:00,610
The now thou sittest,

3633
04:27:00,610 --> 04:27:02,610
let thy hour

3634
04:27:02,610 --> 04:27:04,610
come, when thou must appear to be

3635
04:27:04,610 --> 04:27:06,610
that which thou art eternally.

3636
04:27:06,610 --> 04:27:08,610
And after many a fake

3637
04:27:08,610 --> 04:27:10,610
and false fruitless fruit station

3638
04:27:10,610 --> 04:27:12,610
fruit market crimes, scorn track thy

3639
04:27:12,610 --> 04:27:14,610
lagging fall through boundless space and time.

3640
04:27:16,610 --> 04:27:19,110
That's why we called you in.

3641
04:27:19,110 --> 04:27:22,440
Do you think it's original?

3642
04:27:22,440 --> 04:27:24,440
Not unless he's a genius.

3643
04:27:24,440 --> 04:27:26,440
You like this Nat Jobs poem?

3644
04:27:26,440 --> 04:27:28,440
No, I like Shelley.

3645
04:27:28,440 --> 04:27:30,440
It was written at least one hundred years ago.

3646
04:27:30,440 --> 04:27:32,440
Shelley? One hundred?

3647
04:27:32,440 --> 04:27:34,930
Sure, I knew that.

3648
04:27:34,930 --> 04:27:36,930
You see, Finnis, I told you this lad was a bright boy.

3649
04:27:36,930 --> 04:27:38,930
Sure, but what has it got to do with the case?

3650
04:27:40,930 --> 04:27:42,930
Prometheus Unbound.

3651
04:27:42,930 --> 04:27:44,930
Prometheus was a titan,

3652
04:27:44,930 --> 04:27:46,930
a superhuman character who defied the gods

3653
04:27:46,930 --> 04:27:48,930
to bring fire to humanity.

3654
04:27:48,930 --> 04:27:51,170
The Dahlia Guy

3655
04:27:51,170 --> 04:27:53,170
believes he's Superman.

3656
04:27:53,170 --> 04:27:55,170
Your guess is as good as mine.

3657
04:27:55,170 --> 04:27:57,170
One thing presumes that he's educated.

3658
04:27:57,170 --> 04:27:59,170
What about the link to the Henry case?

3659
04:27:59,170 --> 04:28:01,170
He could have got the wording from the papers.

3660
04:28:01,170 --> 04:28:03,170
As you said, he's fiendishly clever and takes pleasure in taunting us.

3661
04:28:03,170 --> 04:28:05,170
What's happening with the Maldonado case?

3662
04:28:05,170 --> 04:28:07,170
We have the husband in custody.

3663
04:28:07,170 --> 04:28:09,170
We haven't interviewed him yet.

3664
04:28:09,170 --> 04:28:11,170
Well, upstairs then lads

3665
04:28:11,170 --> 04:28:13,170
and see if we can break him.

3666
04:28:13,170 --> 04:28:16,239
Interview Maldonado?

3667
04:28:16,239 --> 04:28:18,870
That was a boomer reference?

3668
04:28:18,870 --> 04:28:25,079
How is that a boomer reference?

3669
04:28:25,079 --> 04:28:29,299
My father watched like

3670
04:28:29,299 --> 04:28:31,299
fucking Zorro.

3671
04:28:31,299 --> 04:28:33,479
What are you talking about?

3672
04:28:35,479 --> 04:28:40,979
Improved your attitude, Angel?

3673
04:28:40,979 --> 04:28:42,979
What do you want me to say?

3674
04:28:42,979 --> 04:28:45,540
I was with Antonia the night she died

3675
04:28:45,540 --> 04:28:47,540
but she left the apartment

3676
04:28:47,540 --> 04:28:51,250
and that was the last time I saw her.

3677
04:29:18,309 --> 04:29:20,309
Wow!

3678
04:29:20,309 --> 04:29:22,610
Religious necklace

3679
04:29:22,610 --> 04:29:24,610
Necklace worn habitually by the murder victim

3680
04:29:24,610 --> 04:29:27,879
Okay, bloodied shirt

3681
04:29:27,879 --> 04:29:29,879
A men's button down shirt stained with blood

3682
04:29:29,879 --> 04:29:31,879
and neighbor, Mrs. Arnada

3683
04:29:31,879 --> 04:29:33,879
testifies to Angel pursuing her from

3684
04:29:33,879 --> 04:29:35,879
apartment buildings.

3685
04:29:35,879 --> 04:29:41,700
Let's go.

3686
04:29:41,700 --> 04:29:43,879
I can't select this.

3687
04:29:43,879 --> 04:29:45,879
So your wife paid you a visit last night?

3688
04:29:45,879 --> 04:29:48,180
What time was that?

3689
04:29:48,180 --> 04:29:50,180
Late, around midnight maybe?

3690
04:29:50,180 --> 04:29:52,180
She didn't stay long.

3691
04:29:52,180 --> 04:29:58,389
I mean that's not...

3692
04:29:58,389 --> 04:30:00,389
I mean he chased her but

3693
04:30:00,389 --> 04:30:02,389
is that technically wrong?

3694
04:30:02,389 --> 04:30:07,170
Because

3695
04:30:07,170 --> 04:30:09,170
she didn't stay long doesn't necessarily mean

3696
04:30:09,170 --> 04:30:11,799
anything. He could have chased her at

3697
04:30:11,799 --> 04:30:13,799
ten o'clock or chased her at two in the morning.

3698
04:30:13,799 --> 04:30:19,040
I mean it's definitely a lie but

3699
04:30:19,040 --> 04:30:25,829
that's the community.

3700
04:30:25,829 --> 04:30:36,049
Okay, so

3701
04:30:36,049 --> 04:30:38,049
You're lying, Angel. You went after her.

3702
04:30:38,049 --> 04:30:40,049
I think you killed her.

3703
04:30:40,049 --> 04:30:42,610
You're out of your mind. My brother will tell you

3704
04:30:42,610 --> 04:30:45,040
I was at home.

3705
04:30:45,040 --> 04:30:49,139
I was at home.

3706
04:30:49,139 --> 04:30:51,889
I was at home.

3707
04:30:51,889 --> 04:30:53,889
I was at home.

3708
04:30:53,889 --> 04:30:55,889
I was at home.

3709
04:30:55,889 --> 04:30:57,889
I was at home.

3710
04:30:57,889 --> 04:30:59,889
I was at home.

3711
04:30:59,889 --> 04:31:01,889
I was at home.

3712
04:31:01,889 --> 04:31:03,889
I was at home.

3713
04:31:03,889 --> 04:31:05,889
I was at home.

3714
04:31:05,889 --> 04:31:08,260
I was at home.

3715
04:31:08,260 --> 04:31:10,260
I was at home.

3716
04:31:10,260 --> 04:31:12,260
I was at home.

3717
04:31:12,260 --> 04:31:15,329
I was at home.

3718
04:31:15,329 --> 04:31:18,399
I was at home.

3719
04:31:18,399 --> 04:31:21,670
Divorce? Okay, I have the divorce paper

3720
04:31:21,670 --> 04:31:23,670
so he can't really lie about this, can he?

3721
04:31:23,670 --> 04:31:25,670
You and your wife weren't getting along. She was divorcing you.

3722
04:31:25,670 --> 04:31:27,670
Is that why you killed her?

3723
04:31:27,670 --> 04:31:29,670
We fought, yeah, but

3724
04:31:29,670 --> 04:31:31,670
we weren't getting a divorce.

3725
04:31:31,670 --> 04:31:33,670
I mean that was his plan.

3726
04:31:33,670 --> 04:31:35,670
I don't believe you, Angel.

3727
04:31:35,670 --> 04:31:37,670
That was thrown in my face five times.

3728
04:31:37,670 --> 04:31:39,670
She pushed you too far and you lashed out.

3729
04:31:39,670 --> 04:31:41,670
I told you.

3730
04:31:41,670 --> 04:31:43,670
I asked the community once and they were wrong.

3731
04:31:43,670 --> 04:31:47,250
Where is it?

3732
04:31:47,250 --> 04:31:49,250
Divorce paper. This is for him, right?

3733
04:31:49,250 --> 04:31:51,809
Yes, okay.

3734
04:31:51,809 --> 04:31:53,809
The judge had set a date. You were going to be

3735
04:31:53,809 --> 04:31:55,809
paraded in front of the whole city for your cruelty

3736
04:31:55,809 --> 04:31:58,370
to her, Angel.

3737
04:31:58,370 --> 04:32:01,250
Antonia, oh Jesus.

3738
04:32:01,250 --> 04:32:04,639
She gave in drunk out of her mind.

3739
04:32:04,639 --> 04:32:06,819
She doesn't normally drink.

3740
04:32:06,819 --> 04:32:09,829
She was looking around in her bag.

3741
04:32:09,829 --> 04:32:11,829
What was that?

3742
04:32:11,829 --> 04:32:13,829
Said she wanted to serve me papers.

3743
04:32:13,829 --> 04:32:16,319
Me, her own husband.

3744
04:32:16,319 --> 04:32:18,319
I slapped her down and she ran out.

3745
04:32:18,319 --> 04:32:21,889
That's the truth.

3746
04:32:21,889 --> 04:32:23,889
What size shoe do you wear, Angel?

3747
04:32:23,889 --> 04:32:25,889
Excuse me.

3748
04:32:25,889 --> 04:32:28,069
What difference does that make?

3749
04:32:28,069 --> 04:32:32,079
When we found your wife,

3750
04:32:32,079 --> 04:32:34,079
her jewelry had been removed.

3751
04:32:34,079 --> 04:32:36,079
Was she wearing her religious

3752
04:32:36,079 --> 04:32:38,079
medallion last night?

3753
04:32:38,079 --> 04:32:42,870
Sure, she always wore that.

3754
04:33:06,069 --> 04:33:09,009
What about the charm bracelet?

3755
04:33:09,009 --> 04:33:11,009
Was she wearing that?

3756
04:33:12,009 --> 04:33:14,959
She never wore it.

3757
04:33:14,959 --> 04:33:21,340
She kept it locked up.

3758
04:33:26,919 --> 04:33:28,919
Your wife has been brutally murdered.

3759
04:33:28,919 --> 04:33:30,919
So how do you explain

3760
04:33:30,919 --> 04:33:32,919
your shirt being covered in blood?

3761
04:33:32,919 --> 04:33:36,439
You found that?

3762
04:33:36,439 --> 04:33:38,439
I cut myself shaving.

3763
04:33:38,439 --> 04:33:42,860
Really, did you?

3764
04:33:42,860 --> 04:33:48,360
Wait, maybe he did.

3765
04:33:48,360 --> 04:33:50,360
That's such a bad excuse, though.

3766
04:33:50,360 --> 04:33:52,360
If you cut yourself shaving, you don't have

3767
04:33:52,360 --> 04:33:54,360
a pint of blood all over you.

3768
04:33:54,360 --> 04:33:56,360
Angel, I'm not going to waste any more time on this.

3769
04:33:56,360 --> 04:33:58,360
Give me something or I'm going to have you charged.

3770
04:33:58,360 --> 04:34:00,360
My brother.

3771
04:34:00,360 --> 04:34:02,360
You cut your mouth and your eyebrow?

3772
04:34:02,360 --> 04:34:04,360
He said some bad things about Antonia last night.

3773
04:34:04,360 --> 04:34:06,360
I cut myself shaving. My eyebrows.

3774
04:34:06,360 --> 04:34:09,369
We got it.

3775
04:34:09,369 --> 04:34:11,369
Keep talking.

3776
04:34:11,369 --> 04:34:13,369
She said she came from the El Dorado bar.

3777
04:34:13,369 --> 04:34:15,369
It's not one of my places.

3778
04:34:15,369 --> 04:34:18,509
We used to buy fruit at the market.

3779
04:34:18,509 --> 04:34:20,509
Cut my throat shaving.

3780
04:34:20,509 --> 04:34:22,509
I think there was always one in his eyes all over my wife.

3781
04:34:22,509 --> 04:34:24,509
What's the name of this fruit market?

3782
04:34:24,509 --> 04:34:26,509
Just picked fruit.

3783
04:34:26,509 --> 04:34:28,509
Ord Street downtown.

3784
04:34:28,509 --> 04:34:32,029
One last question.

3785
04:34:32,029 --> 04:34:34,029
Do the words kiss the blood

3786
04:34:34,029 --> 04:34:36,200
mean anything to you?

3787
04:34:36,200 --> 04:34:38,200
Is this going to be my first perfect?

3788
04:34:38,200 --> 04:34:40,380
Sounds sick to me.

3789
04:34:40,380 --> 04:34:42,380
You're not in the clear by any means, Angel.

3790
04:34:42,380 --> 04:34:44,380
You're going back into a cell.

3791
04:34:44,380 --> 04:34:46,380
Can I get at least one perfect

3792
04:34:46,380 --> 04:34:48,380
and not have a C minus on everything?

3793
04:34:48,380 --> 04:34:50,380
The coroner says it's going to take

3794
04:34:50,380 --> 04:34:52,380
at least a week to get an ID.

3795
04:34:52,380 --> 04:34:54,380
I'm going to get zero out of four on the next one.

3796
04:34:54,380 --> 04:34:57,259
Just watch.

3797
04:34:57,259 --> 04:34:59,259
We need to go to the fruit market.

3798
04:34:59,259 --> 04:35:01,259
I recognize that guy from the papers.

3799
04:35:01,259 --> 04:35:04,080
He's a cop.

3800
04:35:04,080 --> 04:35:07,080
Heavens to Betsy!

3801
04:35:07,080 --> 04:35:12,200
You alright, lady?

3802
04:35:12,200 --> 04:35:14,569
Heavens to Betsy!

3803
04:35:14,569 --> 04:35:19,119
How do I get out of here?

3804
04:35:19,119 --> 04:35:21,549
I need something that says exit this way.

3805
04:35:21,549 --> 04:35:26,220
Oh, thank God.

3806
04:35:26,220 --> 04:35:35,439
Just picked fruit.

3807
04:35:35,439 --> 04:35:37,439
Didn't I try to go here already?

3808
04:35:37,439 --> 04:35:39,680
What's your read on Maldonado?

3809
04:35:39,680 --> 04:35:41,680
I still like him for it.

3810
04:35:41,680 --> 04:35:43,680
Seriously, that line about the guy at the fruit market

3811
04:35:43,680 --> 04:35:46,560
making eyes at his woman?

3812
04:35:46,560 --> 04:35:48,560
I'll get to the market and the guy behind the counter

3813
04:35:48,560 --> 04:35:50,560
will tell us he saw Angel drag his old lady off.

3814
04:35:50,560 --> 04:35:52,560
I wish I was a boomer.

3815
04:35:52,560 --> 04:35:54,560
What are you talking about?

3816
04:35:54,560 --> 04:35:56,560
Hey!

3817
04:35:56,560 --> 04:36:07,689
If someone reports this...

3818
04:36:07,689 --> 04:36:09,689
Somebody recording this.

3819
04:36:09,689 --> 04:36:24,159
I'm recording this.

3820
04:36:24,159 --> 04:36:27,740
Just picked fruit.

3821
04:36:27,740 --> 04:36:29,740
Why aren't I getting five stars?

3822
04:36:29,740 --> 04:36:31,740
I'm not a five-star driver.

3823
04:36:31,740 --> 04:36:33,740
I'm a five-star deductive analyst detective.

3824
04:36:33,740 --> 04:36:39,119
Bog, bog!

3825
04:36:39,119 --> 04:36:44,880
Stop throwing food.

3826
04:36:44,880 --> 04:36:52,430
Hey, you look like somebody that works here.

3827
04:36:52,430 --> 04:36:54,430
Sir, I'm the...

3828
04:36:54,430 --> 04:36:56,430
Wait, you look familiar.

3829
04:36:56,430 --> 04:36:59,180
Hey, from the bar, right?

3830
04:36:59,180 --> 04:37:01,610
Who brings you here?

3831
04:37:01,610 --> 04:37:03,610
LAPD.

3832
04:37:03,610 --> 04:37:05,610
Detective Phelps and Galloway.

3833
04:37:05,610 --> 04:37:07,610
Clem Feeney.

3834
04:37:07,610 --> 04:37:09,610
What can I do for you?

3835
04:37:09,610 --> 04:37:11,610
Did you happen to see a young woman last night?

3836
04:37:11,610 --> 04:37:13,610
21 years old, Hispanic?

3837
04:37:13,610 --> 04:37:16,110
Sure, she came by last night. Why do you ask?

3838
04:37:16,110 --> 04:37:18,409
Because...

3839
04:37:18,409 --> 04:37:21,229
She's dead.

3840
04:37:21,229 --> 04:37:23,229
She was wearing a necklace?

3841
04:37:23,229 --> 04:37:25,229
I didn't notice.

3842
04:37:25,229 --> 04:37:27,229
You weren't paying attention, Feeney?

3843
04:37:27,229 --> 04:37:34,759
Hey, you're getting the wrong idea.

3844
04:37:34,759 --> 04:37:36,759
He's doing the...

3845
04:37:36,759 --> 04:37:38,759
Blink, blink.

3846
04:37:38,759 --> 04:37:40,759
Eyes.

3847
04:37:40,759 --> 04:37:44,759
How much fruit do you sell here after midnight, Clem?

3848
04:37:44,759 --> 04:37:47,259
Uh, not much.

3849
04:37:47,259 --> 04:37:51,560
I sell the odd bottle on the side to the after-hours crowd.

3850
04:37:51,560 --> 04:37:53,560
I don't want any trouble. I'm just trying to make a buck.

3851
04:37:53,560 --> 04:37:56,700
Clem.

3852
04:37:56,700 --> 04:37:57,700
Feet.

3853
04:37:57,700 --> 04:37:58,700
Size.

3854
04:37:58,700 --> 04:38:01,069
Now.

3855
04:38:01,069 --> 04:38:03,069
The young lady arrived around midnight?

3856
04:38:03,069 --> 04:38:05,500
Yeah, something like that.

3857
04:38:05,500 --> 04:38:09,659
Used the phone for a cab and then left.

3858
04:38:09,659 --> 04:38:11,659
Got him.

3859
04:38:11,659 --> 04:38:13,659
You already knew Mrs. Maldonado, didn't you, Clem?

3860
04:38:13,659 --> 04:38:15,659
You make it very easy, while they just like...

3861
04:38:15,659 --> 04:38:17,659
Eyes dart back and forth.

3862
04:38:17,659 --> 04:38:21,659
Her husband went apeshit one day when he caught me talking to her.

3863
04:38:21,659 --> 04:38:24,220
She hadn't been back until last night.

3864
04:38:24,220 --> 04:38:28,509
Where did she go from here?

3865
04:38:28,509 --> 04:38:30,509
She wanted a cab, but I couldn't get her one.

3866
04:38:30,509 --> 04:38:34,939
I was about to offer to drive her, but a car pulled up and she got into that.

3867
04:38:43,900 --> 04:38:47,900
His eyes are not going crazy, but do I have?

3868
04:38:47,900 --> 04:38:59,290
But does that always mean that it's the truth?

3869
04:38:59,290 --> 04:39:01,290
Look, I got a lady's hat that you were wearing.

3870
04:39:01,290 --> 04:39:04,360
Can you describe the car?

3871
04:39:04,360 --> 04:39:06,540
Brown Ford Coupe, I think.

3872
04:39:06,540 --> 04:39:08,540
She seemed to know the guy.

3873
04:39:08,540 --> 04:39:11,099
Did I do it?

3874
04:39:11,099 --> 04:39:13,099
Do you mind if we look around?

3875
04:39:13,099 --> 04:39:15,099
Why would you want to do that?

3876
04:39:15,099 --> 04:39:17,099
No one has ever done this mission as good as me.

3877
04:39:17,099 --> 04:39:19,099
Don't you have to get a court order or something? I have rights.

3878
04:39:19,099 --> 04:39:27,869
Clem?

3879
04:39:27,869 --> 04:39:33,369
Boomer voice?

3880
04:39:33,369 --> 04:39:36,509
It's a Boomer thing.

3881
04:39:36,509 --> 04:39:39,580
It's like the Boomer meme thing.

3882
04:39:39,580 --> 04:39:42,080
Why, because I'm 33?

3883
04:39:42,080 --> 04:39:53,919
33?

3884
04:39:53,919 --> 04:39:57,049
What am I even looking for here?

3885
04:39:57,049 --> 04:40:04,220
Sorry, but you are a Boomer.

3886
04:40:04,220 --> 04:40:06,220
33 year old Boomer stream.

3887
04:40:13,720 --> 04:40:16,090
I just snapped at that lady's neck.

3888
04:40:16,090 --> 04:40:18,090
I put my hands up and everything.

3889
04:40:18,090 --> 04:40:30,889
What am I looking for?

3890
04:40:30,889 --> 04:40:35,500
Go in and register.

3891
04:40:35,500 --> 04:40:42,909
Ah, secret entrance.

3892
04:40:42,909 --> 04:40:45,080
Get their vitamins.

3893
04:40:45,080 --> 04:40:47,080
Check through this stuff before we get back out there.

3894
04:40:47,080 --> 04:40:50,669
Looking for meat?

3895
04:40:50,669 --> 04:40:53,040
Am I looking for meat?

3896
04:40:53,040 --> 04:40:56,430
What are you talking about?

3897
04:40:56,430 --> 04:40:58,799
So what are we hiding in here?

3898
04:40:58,799 --> 04:41:00,799
Found the meat.

3899
04:41:00,799 --> 04:41:02,970
This thing needs a combination.

3900
04:41:02,970 --> 04:41:04,970
Wait, I have that.

3901
04:41:04,970 --> 04:41:11,310
Clues.

3902
04:41:11,310 --> 04:41:18,029
2, 5, 3.

3903
04:41:18,029 --> 04:41:35,360
How do I change this?

3904
04:41:35,360 --> 04:41:37,360
Got it.

3905
04:41:37,360 --> 04:41:41,130
And this is the bracelet.

3906
04:41:41,130 --> 04:41:43,130
Reliquus, 522.

3907
04:41:43,130 --> 04:41:45,130
Wives submit to your husbands as to the lord.

3908
04:41:45,130 --> 04:41:47,130
23, for the husband is the head of the wife.

3909
04:41:47,130 --> 04:41:49,130
Christ is the head of the church.

3910
04:41:49,130 --> 04:41:51,130
His body of which he is the savior.

3911
04:41:51,130 --> 04:42:04,889
Hands.

3912
04:42:04,889 --> 04:42:13,000
Prayer hands.

3913
04:42:13,000 --> 04:42:15,240
That is the bracelet.

3914
04:42:15,240 --> 04:42:27,000
Got it.

3915
04:42:27,000 --> 04:42:32,759
Oh, tire iron.

3916
04:42:32,759 --> 04:42:36,729
And a scalpel.

3917
04:42:36,729 --> 04:42:39,659
I caught someone who was already dead.

3918
04:42:39,659 --> 04:42:42,220
Because he wanted to take their

3919
04:42:42,220 --> 04:42:44,520
body parts.

3920
04:42:44,520 --> 04:42:46,520
This step is dead.

3921
04:42:46,520 --> 04:42:49,150
The creep usually feels they can do whatever they like.

3922
04:42:49,150 --> 04:42:53,369
Must have seen it during the war.

3923
04:42:53,369 --> 04:42:55,369
This fruit stall punk gets about

3924
04:42:55,369 --> 04:42:57,369
10 seconds to explain before

3925
04:42:57,369 --> 04:42:59,369
he pulls his fucking arms off.

3926
04:42:59,369 --> 04:43:01,680
Clips.

3927
04:43:01,680 --> 04:43:11,849
I'm trying to shoot out his tires.

3928
04:43:11,849 --> 04:43:13,849
I'm trying to shoot out his tires.

3929
04:43:13,849 --> 04:43:25,880
I'm trying to shoot out his tires.

3930
04:43:25,880 --> 04:43:27,880
Trying to shoot his tires out.

3931
04:43:27,880 --> 04:43:29,880
This guy is just the tire shooter.

3932
04:43:29,880 --> 04:43:31,880
He doesn't do anything else.

3933
04:43:31,880 --> 04:43:33,880
I bring him along for his...

3934
04:43:33,880 --> 04:43:35,880
One party member that has like revived in the group.

3935
04:43:37,880 --> 04:43:39,880
Jump!

3936
04:43:39,880 --> 04:43:42,830
Nice.

3937
04:43:57,319 --> 04:43:59,319
Ah, that was going so cleanly.

3938
04:44:03,319 --> 04:44:05,319
Get the tire.

3939
04:44:05,319 --> 04:44:10,319
You idiot.

3940
04:44:20,700 --> 04:44:23,319
Alright, get it.

3941
04:44:23,319 --> 04:44:25,319
Hit him, Cole. Spin him out.

3942
04:44:25,319 --> 04:44:27,689
You shot him with a bumper, dude.

3943
04:44:27,689 --> 04:44:29,689
Keep it stabbing. I'm trying to bust his tires.

3944
04:44:32,189 --> 04:44:36,479
Did I kill him? No.

3945
04:44:36,479 --> 04:44:51,180
You're under arrest.

3946
04:44:51,180 --> 04:44:53,180
You're a sick man, Clem.

3947
04:44:53,180 --> 04:44:57,599
You need help.

3948
04:44:57,599 --> 04:44:59,599
Perfect? Did I get my first perfect?

3949
04:44:59,599 --> 04:45:01,599
Oh, no. Don't. Come on.

3950
04:45:01,599 --> 04:45:03,599
Is there more?

3951
04:45:10,159 --> 04:45:12,159
He wants to personally talk to everybody.

3952
04:45:12,159 --> 04:45:14,159
He wants to personally talk to everybody.

3953
04:45:14,159 --> 04:45:16,159
He wants to personally talk to everybody.

3954
04:45:27,659 --> 04:45:40,840
Just like throw him down on the ground.

3955
04:45:40,840 --> 04:45:46,599
Just start fucking cuffing him.

3956
04:45:46,599 --> 04:45:49,159
Oh, yes.

3957
04:45:49,159 --> 04:45:52,240
I did it.

3958
04:45:52,240 --> 04:45:54,240
17 and 17, 13 and 13.

3959
04:45:54,240 --> 04:45:56,240
That is an A plus.

3960
04:45:56,240 --> 04:45:58,599
But, with all the damage that brings it down to like an A minus, probably.

3961
04:45:58,599 --> 04:46:00,779
But, with all the damage that brings it down to like an A minus, probably.

3962
04:46:00,779 --> 04:46:08,459
Well, I'm going to get one.

3963
04:46:08,459 --> 04:46:10,459
Well, I'm going to get one.

3964
04:46:32,459 --> 04:46:34,459
You're sitting there field stripping a cigarette and suddenly he's there looking down on you.

3965
04:46:34,459 --> 04:46:36,459
You're sitting there field stripping a cigarette and suddenly he's there looking down on you.

3966
04:46:36,459 --> 04:46:38,459
You're sitting there field stripping a cigarette and suddenly he's there looking down on you.

3967
04:46:38,459 --> 04:46:40,459
Hello.

3968
04:46:40,459 --> 04:46:42,459
Why do you think we keep saluting that jab-loving son of a bitch with bad juju.

3969
04:46:42,459 --> 04:46:44,459
That's enough out of you three.

3970
04:46:44,459 --> 04:46:46,459
Bad juju?

3971
04:46:46,459 --> 04:46:48,459
Where were you dragged up, a swamp?

3972
04:46:48,459 --> 04:46:55,880
All right, I'm going to pee.

3973
04:46:55,880 --> 04:46:58,119
And I'll be back one more time.

3974
04:46:58,119 --> 04:47:00,490
And I'll be back one more time.

3975
04:47:00,490 --> 04:47:02,490
We will do the next case, probably, and see where we're at.

3976
04:47:02,490 --> 04:47:04,860
We'll do another case.

3977
04:47:04,860 --> 04:47:06,860
The white shoes slay

3978
04:47:06,860 --> 04:47:08,459
more

3979
04:47:08,459 --> 04:47:10,639
more shoes

3980
04:47:10,680 --> 04:47:34,540
I'm just gonna go into the games like I'm gonna data data mine the game and just look at the guy's face

3981
04:47:35,619 --> 04:47:43,029
Good morning gentlemen. I'm what a grand morning. It is too. We have just cause for celebration

3982
04:47:43,669 --> 04:47:49,869
Galloway and Phelps are sending another fiend to San Quentin a nice shall we trial and he'll be struck down with gas

3983
04:47:50,310 --> 04:47:52,830
seeping into his tiny reptile brain

3984
04:47:53,669 --> 04:47:56,099
Now the fresh business

3985
04:47:58,819 --> 04:48:03,319
Yeah, you could the address is on the hill north downtown or Fremont Avenue

3986
04:48:04,139 --> 04:48:11,080
Just to get signal crime scene murder victim crime scene. Is the new letter genuine? Let me be now boys

3987
04:48:11,080 --> 04:48:13,080
We all know how many?

3988
04:48:13,279 --> 04:48:15,450
Give him a second. I'll be right back

3989
04:48:16,330 --> 04:48:21,080
We will do another case and then we'll see where we're at. We might call it

3990
04:48:21,639 --> 04:48:26,619
Eight and I tell let's like 11 Eastern. Yeah, I'd say one more will be be decent. I think

3991
04:48:27,439 --> 04:52:05,020
alrighty, oh

3992
04:52:05,819 --> 04:52:10,110
Hello

3993
04:52:10,310 --> 04:52:12,750
Pinker will let us know in good time. What are we doing a?

3994
04:52:13,590 --> 04:52:18,189
Fine morning indeed. We keep locking them up, but the bodies keep piling up

3995
04:52:24,790 --> 04:52:30,310
Weather effects greetings from sunny, California. Oh stop

3996
04:52:31,549 --> 04:52:34,040
It rains in California

3997
04:52:34,720 --> 04:52:35,959
When

3998
04:52:35,959 --> 04:52:39,220
That's the most surprising we've seen people get murdered

3999
04:52:39,959 --> 04:52:46,240
Cars flying off clips people getting shot, but rain in California

4000
04:52:47,080 --> 04:52:49,040
shocking

4001
04:52:49,040 --> 04:52:54,639
First the letter and now another body. Come on. You can't keep on telling me. There's not a killer still out there

4002
04:53:00,680 --> 04:53:04,040
Getting a vicious killer off the streets is more important than my reputation

4003
04:53:04,680 --> 04:53:08,840
Really and besides lending a big fat Marlin is more impressive than an ocean

4004
04:53:09,680 --> 04:53:11,680
The minnows make it the man

4005
04:53:25,250 --> 04:53:33,509
Please you've got a call for help. He doesn't look real good quick

4006
04:53:33,509 --> 04:53:38,590
What happened some punk held up my stand this guy tried to help and got a bullet for his trouble

4007
04:53:38,790 --> 04:53:42,009
He got hit and a high tailed it through the parking lot get going

4008
04:53:51,020 --> 04:54:03,759
That wasn't enough apparently

4009
04:54:04,240 --> 04:54:27,419
What is with that AI patent? Come on? What nobody can do that. They're pursue. They're pursuing we're pursuing

4010
04:54:28,259 --> 04:54:33,819
You come any closer. I'll pull the trigger put the weapon down now. I

4011
04:54:33,819 --> 04:54:55,130
Did it

4012
04:55:07,639 --> 04:55:12,799
Got a code for

4013
04:55:13,680 --> 04:55:22,119
Got a code for 11k calling KGPL shots fired suspect is down. We're code for but I need an ambulance on grand between 4th and 5th Street

4014
04:55:22,119 --> 04:55:24,119
Oh

4015
04:55:24,159 --> 04:55:27,919
Wait there was a guy was down there wasn't

4016
04:55:31,290 --> 04:55:50,650
Another crime no, maybe the rains gonna put out the fire see it's fine

4017
04:56:16,029 --> 04:56:27,430
So what do you mean that got hold on a lot of car stealing myself

4018
04:56:33,619 --> 04:56:37,400
I know where it is. Do I need to follow this dude still?

4019
04:56:41,479 --> 04:56:42,799
apparently

4020
04:56:42,799 --> 04:56:54,319
Two naked bodies three naked bodies is like really rolling dice here

4021
04:56:55,639 --> 04:57:00,610
Let's hope it's somebody's pick a sweater on my homicide

4022
04:57:00,889 --> 04:57:08,150
Seen secure the rest of the patrolmen are going door-to-door canvassing for witnesses. Thanks. Keep me informed will do detective

4023
04:57:08,650 --> 04:57:14,450
This looks awfully familiar. I think that's the impression the boys from the examiner took with them as well

4024
04:57:14,450 --> 04:57:18,610
There's nothing original under the Sun. Why should murder be any different?

4025
04:57:18,610 --> 04:57:21,889
What do we have so far not much trace evidence to speak of?

4026
04:57:22,369 --> 04:57:27,409
Storm blew in around 10 last night and the rain washed most of it away and the boss did it away

4027

Strangled with a length of rope from my money. It's triple braid again

I've got a feeling we're about to meet another wife killer. You've always got that feeling rusty

4123
05:08:38,860 --> 05:08:42,540
Can you not let your assumptions color your detective waste of time?

4124
05:08:43,979 --> 05:08:47,099
Just go easy felps waste of time

4125

Oh, that's tough

4129
05:09:31,259 --> 05:09:33,979
I mean this two or three different avenues you can go down there

4130
05:09:36,119 --> 05:09:37,159
uh

4131
05:09:37,159 --> 05:09:39,159
The luncheon in me would say

4132
05:09:39,400 --> 05:09:40,360

05:09:40,360 --> 05:09:42,599

4134
05:09:42,599 --> 05:09:44,040

05:09:44,040 --> 05:09:45,560
and

4136
05:09:45,560 --> 05:09:47,560
Maybe maybe a slice of swiss cheese

4137
05:09:49,220 --> 05:09:52,970
Now this is a breakfast scenario you're talking about

4138
05:09:55,130 --> 05:10:01,459
I'm making an egg and bacon and cheese like bacon egg and cheese is one of my favorites

4139
05:10:02,500 --> 05:10:03,619

chive and onion cream cheese

4141
05:10:06,220 --> 05:10:11,819
Now if it's a dinner scenario, uh, we're talking a piece of turkey hot turkey and gravy

4142
05:10:12,979 --> 05:10:14,580
uh for dessert

4143
05:10:14,580 --> 05:10:16,580
You could put a little bit of

4144
05:10:16,819 --> 05:10:18,500
Maple syrup on it

4145
05:10:18,500 --> 05:10:24,580
And throw just a little bit of ricotta cheese on it and that's uh dessert bagel. It really depends

Can you describe your life? I love salmon, but I don't like sand. I don't like walks on bagels

4149
05:10:45,209 --> 05:10:47,209

4150
05:10:47,209 --> 05:10:49,209
She had her green silk dress

4151
05:10:49,770 --> 05:10:51,610
Open-toed white shoes

4152
05:10:51,610 --> 05:10:56,810
Those are her favorite shoes and we come in. Mr. Tarrelton. I'm afraid we have some rather bad news

Why the picture was turned down?

4180
05:14:06,060 --> 05:14:10,299
That is odd

4181
05:14:10,299 --> 05:14:13,340
But i'm somebody may have knocked it over. It's in a really weird place

4182

driver's license

4188
05:15:06,139 --> 05:15:08,540
At least she was spared that particular indignity

4189
05:15:09,180 --> 05:15:15,060

4215
05:17:21,180 --> 05:17:24,700

4226
05:18:12,259 --> 05:18:14,569
There's a laundry store

4227
05:18:14,569 --> 05:18:16,169
baron's bar

4228
05:18:16,169 --> 05:18:31,240
Hmm vampire handbag. Hmm muddy boots size eight. Hmm wet jacket freddy kruger style. Hmm

Triple braid pattern on the bow road. Okay, i'm ready

4230
05:18:38,380 --> 05:18:41,659
Do you have any idea why anyone would want to hurt your wife? No

4231
05:18:42,220 --> 05:18:44,409
Everyone loved teresa

4232
05:18:44,409 --> 05:18:46,169
She was so full of life

4233
05:18:46,169 --> 05:18:56,139
It can't be anyone who knew her

4234
05:18:56,139 --> 05:18:58,139
That's pretty that's pretty truthful

4235
05:18:58,220 --> 05:19:03,110
Like he looks anyone who would want her dead

4236
05:19:03,669 --> 05:19:05,669
No, I don't

4237
05:19:05,750 --> 05:19:13,299
Okay, does he have an alibi you said you went to a party at bobby ross's place. That's right

4238
05:19:13,299 --> 05:19:16,099
Bobby had a bunch of people over we were having a good time

4239
05:19:16,900 --> 05:19:18,979
She said she was bored and decided to leave

4240
05:19:29,770 --> 05:19:32,490
You know your drunk wife leave the party and go off on her own

4241
05:19:33,130 --> 05:19:36,970
Look, I was angry. I was having a good time. She has to go and ruin it

4242
05:19:37,450 --> 05:19:39,450
We always have to do what she wants to do

4243
05:19:40,090 --> 05:19:44,409
Last night she wanted to go dancing any idea where where she always goes

4244
05:19:45,290 --> 05:19:47,290
bar down on north baudry avenue

4245
05:19:47,689 --> 05:19:52,569
Barron's bar there it is baron's bar. She goes there drinks too much gets maudlin and calls me

4246
05:19:53,610 --> 05:20:01,209
I go and bring her home victims state of mind. Mr. Terreltsen was teresa happy at home

4247
05:20:02,569 --> 05:20:04,569
Yeah, I think she was

4248
05:20:07,369 --> 05:20:13,580
Why can't you just look straight ahead you're gonna play more poker man spill it terreltsen

4249
05:20:13,819 --> 05:20:19,180
Or just wear sunglasses wear sunglasses during okay, if you ever get investigated by the police just wear sunglasses

4250
05:20:19,340 --> 05:20:22,939
She wants to go out dancing. We only have the sitter until nine

4251
05:20:23,580 --> 05:20:27,180
I get mad. I tell her to go ahead but i'm staying she storms out

4252
05:20:27,819 --> 05:20:30,060
Look, i'm doing well at cards. I hardly ever do well

4253
05:20:30,700 --> 05:20:34,119
I married her because she was so much full but now she drives me fucking crazy

4254
05:20:36,310 --> 05:20:38,310
What time did she leave the party?

4255
05:20:39,509 --> 05:20:44,389
About 8 30 maybe a little earlier. All right, well she died at two so that would make sense

4256
05:20:45,270 --> 05:20:54,840
Why is he looking at the ceiling? Why even was the last time you saw your wife around 8 30?

4257
05:20:55,560 --> 05:20:59,479
The card game at bobby's was wrapping up. I played out my hand and drove home here

4258
05:21:00,680 --> 05:21:02,680
Paid the sitter and went to bed

4259
05:21:09,779 --> 05:21:11,220
He's got

4260
05:21:11,220 --> 05:21:14,790
Hold on are these

4261
05:21:15,110 --> 05:21:21,189
But what are these the right boots though?

4262
05:21:21,990 --> 05:21:23,990
I'm, not sure these are the right boots

4263
05:21:26,299 --> 05:21:29,209
The size eights, right?

4264
05:21:29,209 --> 05:21:32,169
You're lying larz. You didn't come straight home. Did you?

4265
05:21:32,810 --> 05:21:35,020
And how do you figure that?

4266
05:21:35,020 --> 05:21:39,979
Because you have size eight shoes like that's that's as a stretch, isn't it?

4267
05:21:40,779 --> 05:21:45,209
You were out you got soaked larz. We found your wet weather gear

4268
05:21:45,849 --> 05:21:48,090
I guess okay. I stayed a little later than I said

4269
05:21:48,729 --> 05:21:50,729
This cute little brunette was hitting on me

4270
05:21:51,880 --> 05:21:53,479
Theresa noticed

4271
05:21:53,479 --> 05:21:57,849
I was half cut. I walked her home from bobby's but nothing happened

4272
05:21:58,729 --> 05:22:01,029
I walked back and got the car this morning

4273
05:22:02,380 --> 05:22:04,380
Thanks for answering our questions. Mr. Terrelson

4274
05:22:05,020 --> 05:22:07,419
You'll need to go downtown to identify your what do they get wrong?

4275
05:22:08,139 --> 05:22:12,779
I should have taken her dancing in my experience mac be given to brodge

4276
05:22:13,340 --> 05:22:15,340
Be given into them your entire life

4277
05:22:15,979 --> 05:22:20,220
It sounds like the terrelson broad had her last drink at bar. We should check the place out

4278
05:22:21,099 --> 05:22:23,930

4279
05:22:23,930 --> 05:22:28,490

The nation's focal point as the 80th congress convenes during one of the periods in the nation's history

4283
05:22:52,069 --> 05:22:55,590
Following the Jesus felt

4284
05:23:11,979 --> 05:23:14,939
That's an explosion waiting to happen

4285
05:23:16,380 --> 05:23:21,200
That's an explosion watch out for that. You don't want to make an explosion

4286
05:23:32,150 --> 05:23:42,900

It's about teresa terrelson. Yes, it is. I heard about it on the radio

4292
05:23:57,430 --> 05:23:59,750
They're saying it was that black dahlia freak again

4293
05:24:00,549 --> 05:24:08,040
God, you know, I rang that husband of hers. The babysitter said he was out if you don't mind. We have a few questions

4294
05:24:12,729 --> 05:24:14,970
What time did teresa leave around?

4295
05:24:15,930 --> 05:24:17,930

4296
05:24:19,430 --> 05:24:21,110

4297
05:24:21,110 --> 05:24:23,740
She died at two

4298
05:24:23,740 --> 05:24:25,740
He's just answering a question

4299
05:24:25,979 --> 05:24:31,900
On foot in a car by bus. How was it? She called for a cab. Did you get the number? Sure. I did

4300
05:24:32,380 --> 05:24:33,900
I like teresa

4301
05:24:33,900 --> 05:24:37,099
The only time she has a drink is when things aren't going so good at home

4302
05:24:38,139 --> 05:24:39,979
I was worried about her

4303
05:24:39,979 --> 05:24:47,000
I thought he's getting a gun. Whoa, that went crazy there for a second put out an apb on the cab

4304
05:24:47,799 --> 05:24:53,750

uh

4308
05:25:01,669 --> 05:25:03,669
What about the hobo?

4309
05:25:03,669 --> 05:25:09,349
We've had reports about a tall gaunt looking hobo. We lose that whole section here. I don't understand. I get plenty of bums in here

4310
05:25:10,229 --> 05:25:12,229
But nothing to fit that description

4311
05:25:12,630 --> 05:25:24,569
Okay, it's always the eyes is the eye the likelihood is that whoever she left here with killed her

4312
05:25:25,209 --> 05:25:26,819
Give it up benny

4313
05:25:26,819 --> 05:25:28,819
All right, two creeps were all over

4314
05:25:29,700 --> 05:25:34,900
Promising to take her dancing you get a good look at these guys. Sure. I got a good look

4315
05:25:35,459 --> 05:25:39,220
One of them was a sailor in uniform his cap said, uh

4316
05:25:40,000 --> 05:25:42,340
USS indiana and the other man

4317
05:25:43,380 --> 05:25:45,060
The other guy

4318
05:25:45,060 --> 05:25:47,060
Is richard bates?

4319
05:25:47,220 --> 05:25:49,220
He's sitting in the back right now

4320
05:25:49,380 --> 05:25:51,380
red polo shirt

4321
05:25:51,619 --> 05:25:53,659
Okay

4322
05:25:53,659 --> 05:25:57,819
What about any idea where she was headed? Nope, I didn't get that

4323
05:25:58,979 --> 05:26:19,189
No, really?

4324
05:26:19,189 --> 05:26:23,509
She was murdered benny brutally murdered if you like this lady. I don't know where she was

4325
05:26:24,229 --> 05:26:26,229
You're telling me i'm not cooperating

4326
05:26:26,630 --> 05:26:31,130
Watch it pal. Thank you for your help. Mr. Clough. We'll take it from here

4327
05:26:31,770 --> 05:26:33,770
Hey, no problem. Well

4328
05:26:33,930 --> 05:26:35,930
He's telling the truth. This is bait

4329
05:26:38,250 --> 05:26:39,849
That's him

4330
05:26:39,849 --> 05:26:41,130
LAPD

4331
05:26:41,290 --> 05:26:46,009
The usss toy boat can't let the son of a bitch get away

4332
05:26:48,729 --> 05:26:50,729
It's a very long drawn-out

4333
05:27:03,720 --> 05:27:07,000
Who knows what this guy will pull when he's cornered we could have a killer on our hands

4334
05:27:08,599 --> 05:27:12,180
I really love this in gator zim music

4335
05:27:12,659 --> 05:27:20,819
Oh my I don't hear a killer my gear back in the bar. It was so loud viking listen

4336
05:27:20,819 --> 05:27:24,819
A creature of habit is your killer for some reason. They're sticklers for routine

4337
05:27:25,540 --> 05:27:28,819
Oh my god, that hurts so bad. It fucked up my whole game how it's done

4338
05:27:29,939 --> 05:27:37,340
Come on felps. You're letting this lust get away from you. There was too many audio clips played in some time

4339
05:27:38,060 --> 05:27:40,060
That's what the loud sounds

4340
05:27:41,099 --> 05:27:42,779
Turn them down

4341
05:27:42,779 --> 05:27:47,580
Maybe you shouldn't have waited for me felps

4342
05:27:57,139 --> 05:27:58,259
Damn it

4343
05:27:58,259 --> 05:28:00,259
Damn it

4344
05:28:01,380 --> 05:28:02,580
Oh

4345
05:28:02,580 --> 05:28:04,180
Damn it

4346
05:28:04,180 --> 05:28:05,799
I tried

4347
05:28:05,799 --> 05:28:10,360
I thought I had it

4348
05:28:10,360 --> 05:28:23,459
I thought I had it. Shoot his tires. I'm gonna drill. I'll try to shoot out his tires. Wish me luck

4349
05:28:24,659 --> 05:28:33,369
Let's end this bar

4350
05:28:33,369 --> 05:28:40,709
Put your hands where I can see them

4351
05:28:40,790 --> 05:28:43,270
Okay, baits, you're gonna answer some questions

4352
05:28:44,740 --> 05:28:48,970
I have a choice in this

4353
05:28:49,029 --> 05:28:52,599
Contact with victim

4354
05:28:52,599 --> 05:28:54,599
They kind of got out of a flipped over car

4355
05:28:55,159 --> 05:28:59,000
Last night you went drinking with a lady last night. Now she's dead

4356
05:28:59,639 --> 05:29:02,599
And your face is all messed up. I'm in the clear on that

4357
05:29:03,159 --> 05:29:06,919
She preferred a sailor. You could lay it off on him. Are we finished?

4358
05:29:17,750 --> 05:29:20,180
I I don't know

4359
05:29:20,180 --> 05:29:21,619
I mean that

4360
05:29:21,619 --> 05:29:24,340
It looks like he's not telling the truth, but he could just be a weirdo

4361
05:29:31,700 --> 05:29:37,720
Oh, come on

4362
05:29:37,720 --> 05:29:46,919
Well, do you want my partner to sap you tell us what we want to know she was okay drunk

4363
05:29:47,400 --> 05:29:52,759
Pissed off at her old man wanting to go dancing. I thought I'd ply her with a few drinks and get my end away

4364
05:29:53,159 --> 05:29:55,479
Looks like you're salty at the same idea

4365
05:29:56,599 --> 05:29:59,419
account of movements

4366
05:30:00,020 --> 05:30:02,020
So what happened when you left the bar?

4367
05:30:02,419 --> 05:30:04,900
Sailor boy laid one on me a cheap shot

4368
05:30:06,099 --> 05:30:07,459
After that

4369
05:30:07,459 --> 05:30:11,240
I don't know

4370
05:30:11,400 --> 05:30:15,080
It's like getting into car accidents behind us

4371
05:30:20,810 --> 05:30:36,389
It's a car accident like every 10 seconds glass breaking beeping how many cars are here

4372
05:30:46,259 --> 05:30:48,259
They're like 30 cars

4373
05:30:51,319 --> 05:30:56,360
Come on if we're doing this get it over with shut up. I'm listening

4375
05:31:06,279 --> 05:31:09,990
It's already just fell

4376
05:31:09,990 --> 05:31:24,700
So it was just skydiving landed behind us. All right, that's it

4377
05:31:32,540 --> 05:31:34,540
He's gonna fucking piss his pants

4378
05:31:35,419 --> 05:31:37,740
Is it a jackhammer?

4379
05:31:37,740 --> 05:31:39,740
Why is there a construction?

4380
05:31:39,900 --> 05:31:41,900
If we're doing this get it over with

4381
05:31:44,060 --> 05:31:46,060
You've done time. Haven't you?

4382
05:31:46,700 --> 05:31:49,979
I mean, come on. That's funny. There's nothing behind us sexual assault

4383
05:31:50,860 --> 05:31:56,099
Look, I was lying there on the sidewalk. He flags a cab and jumps. There's nothing behind us

4384
05:31:56,900 --> 05:32:03,299
Uh, we're taking you in baits. How come just for a chat nice private chat

Take him to central. He's a material witness in a murder case find him a cozy cell. Richard here knows the drill

4387
05:32:26,139 --> 05:32:32,119
Oh, it wasn't the it wasn't the car beeping that was making me laugh. It was the fucking like

4388
05:32:33,220 --> 05:32:34,840
crashing and the

4389
05:32:34,840 --> 05:32:36,840
People falling down and the jackhammer

4390
05:32:38,919 --> 05:32:40,919

Were there any incident reports filed in the vicinity of barron's bar on north baudry avenue?

4396
05:33:30,889 --> 05:33:33,770
We're tracking a sailor who was involved in a fight outside the bar

4397
05:33:34,729 --> 05:33:36,729

This is the cab that she took so why did you do

4408
05:35:13,189 --> 05:35:16,869
I don't think this guy's the killer or anything. I just need to ask this guy where the girl went

4409
05:35:18,790 --> 05:35:31,209
Where's the cab cab

4410
05:35:32,330 --> 05:35:42,299

Thank you for pulling over sir. I really appreciate it

4414
05:36:25,080 --> 05:36:30,779
LAPD we're investigating a murder. What's that got to do with me the fare you picked up from baron's bar last night

4415
05:36:30,860 --> 05:36:33,500
What was the woman wearing? It's a green dress

4416
05:36:34,540 --> 05:36:37,259
Oh, don't tell me something's happened to her. Tell me about her

4417
05:36:38,060 --> 05:36:41,180
She was with this sailor and he was all over

4418
05:36:41,819 --> 05:36:44,540
She really animated said she just wanted to dance

4419
05:36:45,259 --> 05:36:47,259
But he had that look in his eye

4420
05:36:47,659 --> 05:36:50,150
Where did you drop them off?

4421
05:36:50,229 --> 05:36:52,709
Said the crystal ballroom what time?

4422
05:36:54,150 --> 05:36:55,590

About 30 something like that. Thanks. You've been a big help. Well, that's gonna ruin my day

4424

Sorry, I just ruined your day even more can we fit through this person's house

4425
05:37:30,180 --> 05:37:36,659
Easy take home that holds six bottles. It's the quality drink that's as refreshing as it is delicious

4426
05:37:37,590 --> 05:37:43,349
King of refreshment for that anytime first the thirst of a king can be quenched for just the nickel

4428

4430
05:38:10,200 --> 05:38:12,200
Trumpet with

4431
05:38:13,799 --> 05:38:15,799
Plunger

4432
05:38:19,099 --> 05:38:29,619

4433
05:38:30,819 --> 05:38:53,819
Clogged the trumpet. You can't trump. You can't trumpet that you can't jump over this

4434
05:38:54,619 --> 05:39:05,060
My god, please

4435
05:39:05,060 --> 05:39:09,700
Why don't you come on out jimmy? I won't let them hurt you not my honey boy

4436
05:39:10,659 --> 05:39:13,939
I told you not to call me that woman. Now shut the hell up

4437
05:39:14,819 --> 05:39:16,819
You shut the hell up

4438
05:39:17,779 --> 05:39:20,979
Is that the lady of the house

4439
05:39:21,700 --> 05:39:28,500
It's a nice story. Two old lovebirds just moved in together, but they had a falling out and chased across the yard with a 12 gauge

4440
05:39:29,459 --> 05:39:31,220
Now it's him

4441
05:39:31,220 --> 05:39:33,590
This is funny to you rookie

4442
05:39:33,590 --> 05:39:36,150
Yeah, that's funny. You're gonna laugh at me smirk at that

4443
05:39:55,610 --> 05:39:58,650
I wanted to just be one two three clean shots

4444
05:40:04,520 --> 05:40:07,799
Just one two three, we've all tried to run in the front

4445
05:40:10,659 --> 05:40:12,659
Oh, well that was a lot worse

4446
05:40:13,139 --> 05:40:19,540
Okay, I don't know fucking that up again

4447
05:40:20,310 --> 05:40:25,319
Why is it gone?

4448
05:40:25,319 --> 05:40:29,419
No

4449
05:40:29,419 --> 05:40:31,580
Yeah, we were the npcs at that point. You're right

4450
05:40:32,299 --> 05:40:34,299
well, uh

4451
05:40:34,299 --> 05:40:48,819
Never mind did not press x. I didn't really have an option to I was trying to run in there and punch him

4452
05:40:49,619 --> 05:40:52,180
What is the why does it keep popping up in this spirit?

4453
05:40:53,459 --> 05:41:05,709
See that it's still possible to do it. It's down here

4454
05:41:45,459 --> 05:41:48,020
All right interrogation he's an interview too

4455
05:41:48,979 --> 05:41:54,020
Thanks. What do you make of him sailor on furlough? Who looks like he's in trouble and knows it

4456
05:41:54,979 --> 05:41:57,610
straight through the red light

4457
05:41:58,970 --> 05:42:06,970
Detectives felps and Galloway

4458
05:42:07,290 --> 05:42:11,290
We know why you're here. Jessup. So what would be best if you answered our questions truthfully?

4459
05:42:12,299 --> 05:42:14,299
I don't want any trouble. That's why i'm here

4460
05:42:14,619 --> 05:42:18,700
I heard on the radio about this lady getting killed. I got lead from my co to come down straight away

4461
05:42:19,500 --> 05:42:21,659
So why did you kill her?

4462
05:42:21,659 --> 05:42:23,659
I didn't kill anyone

4463
05:42:23,979 --> 05:42:26,860
Look, you need to believe me. Let's start at the beginning

4464
05:42:29,860 --> 05:42:31,860
contact, uh us

4465
05:42:32,500 --> 05:42:38,979
Maybe able sea man seen with victim on night of murder. You went to baron's bar. What time did you arrive?

4466
05:42:39,540 --> 05:42:44,040
I got a 24-hour pass. I got there around seven. That's where you met teresa tarrelton

4467
05:42:45,139 --> 05:42:46,020
Sure

4468
05:42:46,020 --> 05:42:48,020
We had a couple of drinks

4469
05:42:52,759 --> 05:42:58,759
So you tried to make a woman who was incredibly drunk look i'm not proud of myself, but I never hurt her

4470
05:42:59,560 --> 05:43:01,560
You took her dancing. That's right

4471
05:43:02,040 --> 05:43:04,040
Cut a cab to the crystal ballroom

4472
05:43:05,110 --> 05:43:07,259
That's true

4473
05:43:07,259 --> 05:43:10,540
Right. You had a fist fight with richard bates over mrs. Tarrelton

4474
05:43:11,419 --> 05:43:13,419
You met the guy. He's a creep

4475
05:43:14,060 --> 05:43:16,060
You should take a look at him for this

4476
05:43:16,540 --> 05:43:26,009
I mean he's pointing the finger directly at you jessup. I only had one night before I was back in the tub

4477
05:43:26,490 --> 05:43:30,330
He had all the time in the world to look for some action. I belted him. I'd do it again

4478
05:43:30,970 --> 05:43:35,950
She was better off with me. Sure. You're a shining example of chivalry jessup

4479
05:43:37,959 --> 05:43:41,959
Movements prior to murder. Where did you go after the crystal ballroom?

4480
05:43:42,919 --> 05:43:45,240
I think the wind had gone out of her sails by then

4481
05:43:46,119 --> 05:43:48,759
She caught a cab and I caught a cab and I got a bus

4482
05:43:55,430 --> 05:43:57,830
Uh, they started shaky at first but

4483
05:43:58,790 --> 05:44:02,360
No, no

4484
05:44:02,360 --> 05:44:04,360
They're not it's not he can't only

4485
05:44:06,900 --> 05:44:09,060
No, we spoke to the cab driver

4486
05:44:09,700 --> 05:44:12,340
Tell us what really happened at the crystal ballroom

4487
05:44:12,979 --> 05:44:15,560
I'd had enough

4488
05:44:15,560 --> 05:44:19,479
She was all upset about her husband bawling about her kids. She she looked old

4489
05:44:20,520 --> 05:44:22,520
Left around closing maybe 130

4490
05:44:23,319 --> 05:44:28,380
Got on a bus and she fell asleep on my shoulder. We've only told lies an all-american

4491
05:44:28,860 --> 05:44:33,819
249 he hasn't said anything else besides a lie place. She jumped off and I stayed on it downtown

4492
05:44:34,540 --> 05:44:39,500
After that, I caught another bus to san pedro. So that's probably also down there. She's being scrapped

4493
05:44:39,979 --> 05:44:42,939
And that was the last you saw of teresa. Yeah, that's right

4494
05:44:43,979 --> 05:44:46,459
We didn't say much. I think she was kind of embarrassed

4495
05:44:49,799 --> 05:44:55,400
Cab ride cab driver said that you were getting pretty familiar with teresa. It's not how i'd put it

4496
05:44:56,360 --> 05:45:02,479
But is that that is that his okay, so this is that he's telling the truth

4497
05:45:03,599 --> 05:45:05,599
You look at how confident he is right there

4498
05:45:13,689 --> 05:45:17,369
really

4499
05:45:17,369 --> 05:45:18,330
so

4500
05:45:18,330 --> 05:45:21,819
Wait a minute. Can I like accuse with the cab?

4501
05:45:22,459 --> 05:45:33,869
hire tracks

4502
05:45:33,869 --> 05:45:41,259
Well, okay the first three questions he was like his eyes were darting around and now all of a sudden he's like smiling

4503
05:45:48,990 --> 05:45:54,110
Tell the truth jessup. You're running out of time. You wanted to get laid and teresa wouldn't come across

4504
05:45:54,509 --> 05:45:57,950
It made you crazy. So you strangled her with a piece of rope

4505
05:45:58,669 --> 05:46:00,669
For christ's sake. That's not true

4506
05:46:01,759 --> 05:46:05,040
I felt sorry for her. What proof do you have that I strangled her?

4507
05:46:11,209 --> 05:46:13,209
The cab statement

4508
05:46:15,740 --> 05:46:17,740
We got you

4509
05:46:18,060 --> 05:46:20,409
In the cab

4510
05:46:20,409 --> 05:46:22,409
That's the proof. We have you took a cab

4511
05:46:22,889 --> 05:46:25,259
Wait, I can back out. I made a mistake

4512
05:46:25,979 --> 05:46:28,169
You can actually do that

4513
05:46:28,169 --> 05:46:35,450
Oh, okay, so the last thing you wanted was her playing hard to get did that make you mad sailor told every single thing

4514
05:46:36,409 --> 05:46:42,409
She knew what a guy's looking for all broads do dancing comes second. And what happened at the crystal ballroom?

4515
05:46:43,290 --> 05:46:48,490
Nothing, not even a little hand relief. She had another couple of drinks. There was no fun left in her

4516
05:46:48,970 --> 05:46:50,970
Just poured her guts out to some bartender

4517
05:46:52,639 --> 05:46:56,000
We're holding you till we can clear this with the driver. He literally did

4518
05:46:56,080 --> 05:46:59,040
Yeah, my co said as much didn't tell the truth every time

4519
05:47:00,080 --> 05:47:04,240
Can you put the guy in two in a cell and inform the commander? Sure detective. Okay

4520
05:47:07,389 --> 05:47:08,909
Got a message for you

4521
05:47:08,909 --> 05:47:14,590
Siding of your disfigured hobo on brand between temple and sunset and looks like the bow has a record too

4522
05:47:14,830 --> 05:47:17,950
He's wanted in connection with two female assault. Thanks

4523
05:47:20,270 --> 05:47:25,630
What now drive all the way to san peter and check his locker then we already do the bus story checks out

4524
05:47:26,349 --> 05:47:29,069
There's a depot at 1660 february boulevard

4525
05:47:30,029 --> 05:47:39,259
Investigate interstate bus depot three suspects in the can one on the hoof

4526
05:47:39,900 --> 05:47:41,900
Still no hard evidence on any of them

4527
05:47:44,139 --> 05:47:55,979
Watch it, will you okay? Go ahead

4528
05:48:04,669 --> 05:48:07,709
11k roger that on the autonomous contact

4529
05:48:08,509 --> 05:48:10,509
It's possible

4530
05:48:11,229 --> 05:48:13,849
Thank you earlier on

4531
05:48:15,529 --> 05:48:36,009
Your sandwich is awesome. I love it

4532
05:48:37,049 --> 05:48:41,400
I could arguably say

4533
05:48:41,400 --> 05:48:43,400
That I could eat tuna fish every single day

4534
05:48:44,040 --> 05:48:49,119
I probably could

4535
05:48:49,119 --> 05:48:53,919
Satan like appears in front of me and it's like you can only eat tuna fish for the rest of your life

4536
05:48:55,119 --> 05:48:56,479
How do you plead?

4537
05:48:56,479 --> 05:48:58,080
I'm like guilty

4538
05:48:58,080 --> 05:49:13,259
I do it. What kind of trial is that?

4539
05:49:14,139 --> 05:49:31,360
All right bust up

4540
05:49:31,520 --> 05:49:34,639
Somebody

4541
05:49:34,639 --> 05:49:36,799
And thank you, ma'am. You have a safe trip now

4542
05:49:38,330 --> 05:49:40,330
Where are you boys headed today?

4543
05:49:41,130 --> 05:49:47,150
LAPD we're after the driver of all-american 249 would have been around midnight onwards last night

4544
05:49:47,549 --> 05:49:49,549
Uh, just a minute

4545
05:49:49,549 --> 05:49:52,560
Do you like raw tuna? I do

4546
05:49:54,220 --> 05:50:00,540
Spicy tuna is probably my favorite role. Where can we find a restaurant frank is out on the seven four?

4547
05:50:01,180 --> 05:50:05,740
Can you tell us the route? Hang on? Uh, I'm should have I don't need it that often but

4548
05:50:05,740 --> 05:50:12,729
Yeah

4549
05:50:12,729 --> 05:50:15,689
I like raw tuna in the spicy tuna roll, but I don't like raw tuna

4550
05:50:16,490 --> 05:50:17,369
just

4551
05:50:17,369 --> 05:50:19,290
Eating raw tuna

4552
05:50:19,290 --> 05:50:21,290
I know that's a lot of people really like that

4553
05:50:21,610 --> 05:50:24,970
But not not for me. It's got to be in something else

4554
05:50:25,689 --> 05:50:33,520
I'll need to run the loop locate all-american 74

4555
05:50:34,400 --> 05:50:36,319
Route number 74

4556
05:50:36,319 --> 05:50:39,580
Do I have to memorize this or is this going to be on the map?

4557
05:50:40,939 --> 05:50:42,939
We're not going to drive the whole thing. Are we?

4558
05:50:43,659 --> 05:50:44,939
Won't take long

4559
05:50:44,939 --> 05:50:49,790
We have a siren

4560
05:50:49,790 --> 05:51:03,840
Okay, wait, I can't decide between the tuna fish and the chicken

4561
05:51:04,479 --> 05:51:05,799
uh

4562
05:51:05,799 --> 05:51:08,759
Tuna eat the tuna. That's the best one

4563
05:51:11,930 --> 05:51:28,729
What novels all-american 74? Let's go get him about the back door. God damn it

4564
05:51:29,209 --> 05:51:47,819
All right, so we just have to drive there this line

4565
05:51:51,560 --> 05:51:55,159
Okay, you get in the car like he's never in the car with shit

4566
05:51:56,360 --> 05:52:00,590
I'm just too fast with this guy

4567
05:52:03,840 --> 05:52:12,080
Get in okay looking for a bus

4568
05:52:13,450 --> 05:52:14,569
bus

4569
05:52:14,569 --> 05:52:16,569
74 could be a long trip col

4570
05:52:17,290 --> 05:52:22,889
Or it could be a short one and here's me without my hip flask and only a pain in the ass for company

4571
05:52:23,049 --> 05:52:28,810
Way to kick off the drive in high spirits rusty comments like that put me in just the right mood for some leg work

4572
05:52:29,130 --> 05:52:31,130
Touchy, you know what your problem is

4573
05:52:31,369 --> 05:52:36,009
You don't like hard work to find this kind of rigorous search is what police work is all about

4574
05:52:36,490 --> 05:52:40,409
Discipline say how big is the bus just as bored as I am

4575
05:52:41,130 --> 05:52:47,529
I'm sure i've seen a bus the whole game

4576
05:52:48,409 --> 05:52:49,610
let alone

4577
05:52:49,610 --> 05:52:51,529
Try to find one now

4578
05:52:51,529 --> 05:53:21,630
I'm currently driving with traffic. So that might be a problem

4579
05:53:22,590 --> 05:53:24,509
If so are they

4580
05:53:24,509 --> 05:53:36,650
No, i'm still no sign of him. Did you doze off rusty? I think you slept through my solving the case

4581
05:53:36,889 --> 05:53:42,090
Yeah, very funny. Just give me a nudge if you see him, right? How about you nudge me found that's a job

4582
05:53:42,169 --> 05:53:46,509
For your wife

4583
05:53:46,509 --> 05:53:50,430
That's the bus we're looking for ease in behind her and get her to the side of the road

4584
05:54:03,360 --> 05:54:07,069
All right. Yeah

4585
05:54:07,069 --> 05:54:09,959
Hello

4586
05:54:09,959 --> 05:54:12,779
There's some kind of problem buddy

4587
05:54:12,919 --> 05:54:18,700
LAPD we're investigating a murder you had a sailor and a woman in a green dress on your bus late last night

4588
05:54:18,939 --> 05:54:23,259
That's correct. And the woman got off first around 2 a.m. Yeah, that's right

4589
05:54:23,740 --> 05:54:29,340
And the sailor stayed on all the way to downtown. Can you tell us where you let the woman off on california street?

4590
05:54:30,060 --> 05:54:35,099
They tell you the truth. She looked a little lost like she got off on the wrong stop or something this voice

4591
05:54:35,340 --> 05:54:39,419
I didn't like dropping her off near that hobo camp. Who is that a big help? Mr. Zeffirelli?

4592
05:54:40,299 --> 05:54:42,299
I've heard it a million times

4593
05:54:43,020 --> 05:54:52,029
So sailor boy escaped by the seat of his bell bottom trousers left the broad alive

4594
05:54:52,669 --> 05:54:54,669
Left her by the hobo camp

4595
05:54:54,830 --> 05:54:56,830
Which means he's as good as kill

4596
05:54:57,229 --> 05:55:00,750
We can't eliminate any of them, but the disfigured man should be our starting point

4597
05:55:01,389 --> 05:55:06,750
I'm gonna call for some backup. These bows hate cops. These bows hate cops

4598
05:55:07,549 --> 05:55:09,549
um

4599
05:55:09,549 --> 05:55:11,549
Okay, so we're gonna

4600
05:55:12,409 --> 05:55:14,409
Go to the hobo camp

4601
05:55:18,590 --> 05:55:20,590
This is a long one

4602
05:55:21,470 --> 05:55:23,630
Breathe though breathe. Damn it

4603
05:55:24,430 --> 05:55:27,369
That was not danny devito

4604
05:55:27,689 --> 05:55:32,159
Danny devito, who are you getting that?

4605
05:55:52,119 --> 05:55:53,919
No

4606
05:55:53,919 --> 05:55:55,360
No

4607
05:55:55,360 --> 05:56:07,000
No, we're about to go to the hobo camp too busy right now. Sorry

4608
05:56:25,200 --> 05:56:31,229
Is it weird that I don't like to have this on because I think it's too loud

4609
05:56:32,990 --> 05:56:59,659
It's annoying I'd rather deal with driving into people nice dodge there's a lightning reflexes there

4610
05:57:19,340 --> 05:57:22,459
We'd like a word with you save it for someone who's interested

4611
05:57:23,419 --> 05:57:24,939
They're fascist

4612
05:57:25,020 --> 05:57:30,700
Come to move us on and steal what little we have left six rounds won't get us far. Do you have a fire axe?

4613
05:57:37,740 --> 05:57:41,520
Um, these men know they're hovering a murderer

4614
05:57:43,360 --> 05:57:45,439
Beat up the main guy

4615
05:57:45,439 --> 05:57:50,080
I've seen every movie. I've seen every tv show every video game. Once you beat up the fucking boss everybody else stops

4616
05:57:50,959 --> 05:57:54,729
And they change their mind instantly

4617
05:58:05,400 --> 05:58:08,040
What's your name?

4618
05:58:08,040 --> 05:58:10,139
Comrade star very funny

4619
05:58:11,020 --> 05:58:13,020
We'll find out from your personal effects

4620
05:58:13,099 --> 05:58:18,779
Stuart ackerman, you're under suspicion for murder every video game. We're taking you downtown. Yeah

4621
05:58:19,419 --> 05:58:23,419
Every single one thing more to me than what the japanese have already done

4622
05:58:24,380 --> 05:58:38,380
Every single one the kremlin's over here felps tossing

4623
05:58:39,740 --> 05:58:41,979
One that came out three years and two days ago

4624
05:58:43,959 --> 05:58:46,919
well, I mean you gotta be specifically a movie or or a

4625
05:58:47,639 --> 05:58:50,360
tv show or a video game dude, what are you talking about? Come on

4626
05:58:59,840 --> 05:59:01,680
still working jack

4627
05:59:01,680 --> 05:59:04,000
I'm off to the lighthouse club in santa monica

4628
05:59:04,959 --> 05:59:10,779
Hello jack. Mr. Benson. This is cortney sheldon

4629
05:59:11,500 --> 05:59:16,060
He's a buddy of mine from the war. Well, i'm sure you two will want to polish some old war stories

4630
05:59:16,700 --> 05:59:18,139
Good evening jack

4631
05:59:18,139 --> 05:59:20,200
Mr. Sheldon

4632
05:59:20,200 --> 05:59:22,959
Good night, sir

4633
05:59:22,959 --> 05:59:30,319
Take a seat cortney

4634
05:59:30,319 --> 05:59:32,319
We need your help

4635
05:59:32,319 --> 05:59:33,680
jack

4636
05:59:33,680 --> 05:59:35,680
I told you I would have nothing to do with that

4637
05:59:38,590 --> 05:59:40,270
I'm fine, too jack

4638
05:59:40,270 --> 05:59:42,270
Medical school's going well

4639
05:59:42,270 --> 05:59:44,439
I got a part-time job

4640
05:59:44,520 --> 05:59:46,520
Do dope peddlers need part-time jobs?

4641
05:59:47,319 --> 05:59:49,630
We made a mistake and we're in trouble jack

4642
05:59:50,669 --> 05:59:54,349
A local gangster micky cohen is putting on the squeeze

4643
05:59:55,689 --> 06:00:02,009
So hand it over walk away. What's stopping you? We had a deal with them that they would dole it out slowly

4644
06:00:02,650 --> 06:00:08,250
They said they were the peanuts movie by the way clinics and doctors like but they've been moving it on to addicts

4645
06:00:08,729 --> 06:00:14,729
And they can't cope with the purity. So your problem is with gangsters being dishonest. My problem is that people are dying

4646
06:00:15,290 --> 06:00:18,810
And then if this gets back to us, we'll all end up in jail

4647
06:00:20,669 --> 06:00:26,750
So, how am I supposed to help cortney? This isn't the war. I can't just wave a magic wand and clean up your mess

4648
06:00:28,029 --> 06:00:35,319
due to negotiating

4649
06:00:35,400 --> 06:00:39,400
jack

4650
06:00:39,400 --> 06:00:42,599
The only thing these guys understand is force sheldon

4651
06:00:43,400 --> 06:00:48,040
They got to the top back east by proving to be more vicious than the english the irish and the dutch

4652
06:00:48,119 --> 06:00:51,560
I googled the exact day and exact moment of the movie coming up

4653
06:00:51,720 --> 06:00:53,000
Society

4654
06:00:53,000 --> 06:00:59,880
I'd say cortney you want to be a doctor. Give me another one. How can you fight with that?

4655
06:01:00,840 --> 06:01:03,599
We give me another year for a day

4656
06:01:08,200 --> 06:01:10,840
I didn't make it through the war to come back to this kind of shit sheldon

4657
06:01:18,009 --> 06:01:20,970
1999 17 made that herald and kumar go to white castle

4658

16 years ago four days night before christmas

4659
06:01:44,990 --> 06:02:10,299
It's none of these ropes

4660
06:02:10,299 --> 06:02:15,340
Looks familiar safe bet it'll match the mark under teresa terrell three years ago sean of the dead

4661
06:02:31,689 --> 06:02:37,709
purse

4662
06:02:37,709 --> 06:02:38,990

4663
06:02:38,990 --> 06:02:39,950
venom

4664
06:02:39,950 --> 06:02:49,740
It doesn't look like much of a dancer

4665
06:02:53,709 --> 06:02:55,709
terregate stubert ackerman

4666
06:02:55,709 --> 06:03:24,319
Two years six months ago

4667
06:03:28,090 --> 06:03:33,529
Ah, damn that's got me though. Oh two years and six. It's the six months. That's getting me

4668
06:03:34,250 --> 06:03:39,770
The husband has an alibi, but no real motive other than neglect. Uh, the the antebell free

4669
06:03:40,729 --> 06:03:42,729
antebell for whatever it was

4670
06:03:43,130 --> 06:03:45,689
Pulling the same stick antebell for the doll is back

4671
06:03:46,409 --> 06:03:48,409
Not you're gonna kill us

4672
06:03:48,490 --> 06:03:55,319
Have the evidence we know she was here

4673
06:03:55,799 --> 06:03:58,439
All we need is a confession. We can charge the bum with murder

4674
06:04:12,240 --> 06:04:13,680
I mean, no

4675
06:04:13,680 --> 06:04:16,299
I'm just saying when movies came

4676
06:04:16,779 --> 06:04:22,409

I don't even know. I don't know

4681

No guns

4682
06:04:54,189 --> 06:04:59,630
I need to where's the interrogation room?

4683
06:05:03,500 --> 06:05:05,500
Follow interview room one

4684
06:05:06,669 --> 06:05:09,150
Ackerman you were in the marines. How do you know?

4685
06:05:10,029 --> 06:05:14,270
The corps selected big guys for flamethrower duty. That's how you got the burns

4686
06:05:15,150 --> 06:05:18,430
Life expectancy was five minutes for guy in flamethrower detail

4687
06:05:19,150 --> 06:05:24,509
What kind of a government puts weight like that on a man's shoulders? You'll get no argument from me

4688
06:05:25,229 --> 06:05:26,830
It was a heavy load

4689
06:05:26,830 --> 06:05:28,830
You feel like somebody actually got it?

4690
06:05:31,500 --> 06:05:34,540
Okay, how about this one guys willard? I need a year and a day

4691
06:05:48,220 --> 06:05:51,630
Okay, nice job. Why did you kill mrs. Terreltson?

4692
06:05:52,959 --> 06:05:55,599
I have no recollection of the people I have killed

4693
06:05:56,720 --> 06:05:58,720
Why lie lie?

4694
06:06:00,599 --> 06:06:02,599
You hate women ackerman

4695
06:06:07,360 --> 06:06:09,360
How much did you hate mrs. Terreltson?

4696
06:06:10,599 --> 06:06:12,840
I ache to put my seed in them

4697
06:06:13,400 --> 06:06:14,919
I have guards

4698
06:06:14,919 --> 06:06:19,000
We use for them. Okay

4699
06:06:20,540 --> 06:06:22,959
so

4700
06:06:22,959 --> 06:06:28,360
So you did it a bus driver dropped mrs. Terreltson near your camp around 2 a.m

4701
06:06:28,520 --> 06:06:31,000
Why did you take her up to the hill? Which hill?

4702
06:06:32,279 --> 06:06:34,040
I have many places

4703
06:06:34,040 --> 06:06:41,150
I go where I please

4704
06:06:41,310 --> 06:06:48,509
You're clearly insane ackerman the state of california does not execute mental patients. I don't know the names of the women i've killed

4705
06:06:49,310 --> 06:06:53,650
But i've killed many of them. So this is the guy their necks are so fragile

4706
06:06:55,069 --> 06:06:58,110
This is the guy this is the dude he's the guy that's killing all the people

4707
06:06:58,990 --> 06:07:04,490
Where were you around 2 a.m. Last night?

4708
06:07:05,290 --> 06:07:09,419
at the camp

4709
06:07:09,419 --> 06:07:11,419
Hold on. What what do we got?

4710
06:07:11,419 --> 06:07:13,639
2 a.m

4711
06:07:13,639 --> 06:07:15,639
At the camp we brought her up there

4712
06:07:15,799 --> 06:07:18,439
Laundry boots. Well, what's what about his shoe size?

4713
06:07:19,159 --> 06:07:42,080
The rope the boat though, where are the tire the tire tracks?

4714
06:07:43,360 --> 06:07:47,159
Turned tire tracks on muddy ground close to body. This got into a car

4715
06:07:48,119 --> 06:07:54,909
What are you staring at boy?

4716
06:08:03,290 --> 06:08:04,729
bus driver frank

4717
06:08:04,729 --> 06:08:07,049
Testifies to dropping teresa near the camp

4718
06:08:08,250 --> 06:08:10,250
rope matching

4719
06:08:10,409 --> 06:08:13,209
Put your mark on victim's neck found in ackerman's lean to

4720
06:08:14,909 --> 06:08:19,310
And this is found in stuart ackerman's lean to her purse and the rope that killed her

4721
06:08:20,189 --> 06:08:24,330
So wouldn't it be like the rope that killed her?

4722
06:08:25,049 --> 06:08:40,159
I mean, that's that's obvious

4723
06:08:40,400 --> 06:08:42,400
I wanted you to take one of the other ones away

4724
06:08:51,340 --> 06:08:55,580
You were up on the hill you were seen during the day. We have a witness. We have evidence

4725
06:08:55,580 --> 06:08:58,619
You got the blood on me ackerman and i'll see what I can do for you

4726
06:08:59,680 --> 06:09:01,680
I despise your pity

4727
06:09:01,840 --> 06:09:03,840
You have nothing that links me to this woman

4728
06:09:04,400 --> 06:09:10,330
Did he get rid of the rope?

4729
06:09:10,409 --> 06:09:15,069
Oh shit

4730
06:09:15,069 --> 06:09:17,389
It's not his boots. He doesn't have a car

4731
06:09:18,189 --> 06:09:26,319
This is the only other thing

4732
06:09:26,569 --> 06:09:27,849
but just

4733
06:09:27,849 --> 06:09:32,299
I was gonna say the rope

4734
06:09:32,299 --> 06:09:36,860
We have you cold ackerman her purse and the ballroom ticket were in your lean to

4735
06:09:37,500 --> 06:09:39,500
Tell us why you did it

4736
06:09:39,580 --> 06:09:42,139
I kill because people need killing

4737
06:09:42,939 --> 06:09:44,939
That's what I was trained to do

4738
06:09:47,630 --> 06:09:52,290
Stuart yeah, i'm charging you with the murder of teresa taroldson

4739
06:10:00,119 --> 06:10:02,119
Does that he did he do the all the other ones too then?

4740
06:10:02,759 --> 06:10:15,240
He's innocent a man down on his lot. I can abide

4741
06:10:16,119 --> 06:10:20,439
But a filthy red who chooses to live outside the rules of society. I cannot stomach

4742
06:10:21,840 --> 06:10:24,560
Maybe poor threes or taroldson will provide the catalyst we need

4743
06:10:25,740 --> 06:10:31,180
I've spoken to the chief and the mayor and I think it's time we send some men in to remove the godless and send them

4744
06:10:31,180 --> 06:10:33,180
On the way over the county line

4745
06:10:33,180 --> 06:10:35,479
A grand day that will be gentlemen

4746
06:10:35,880 --> 06:10:37,880
And a grand result you have brought me

4747
06:10:38,360 --> 06:10:40,939
You two are fast becoming my finest crusaders

4748
06:10:41,639 --> 06:10:49,599
Hey, thanks

4749
06:10:49,599 --> 06:10:52,409
Oh

4750
06:10:52,409 --> 06:10:54,409
15 out of 17

4751
06:10:55,049 --> 06:11:00,750
The tarltons might have just as steward ackerman is pronounced fit to stand trial

4752
06:11:02,189 --> 06:11:12,680
I feel like the last two

4753
06:11:12,840 --> 06:11:17,560
Crimes were the two crazy people that were like I did it. It was me

4754
06:11:18,759 --> 06:11:38,860
You know what I mean?

4755
06:11:38,860 --> 06:11:41,229
Did I fall for the trick?

4756
06:11:54,430 --> 06:12:06,330
This torched zone studio secretary murder will have to be for another time

4757
06:12:07,130 --> 06:12:20,700
Maybe tomorrow. It's getting late. We'll see how it starts though

4758
06:12:22,220 --> 06:12:26,119
Again, we got to see his face this time

4759
06:12:27,319 --> 06:12:40,700
Of course, we will look into it. Yes. I'm aware that it's an election year. Keep a hold of your heart counciler

4760
06:12:41,419 --> 06:12:43,419
Now is not the time to lose your nerve

4761
06:12:45,869 --> 06:12:52,060
It would appear that someone has hooked a rose gold wedding ring a matching engagement ring sound familiar

4762
06:12:52,380 --> 06:12:53,740
Deirdre muller

4763
06:12:53,740 --> 06:12:59,209
Press the pawn broker and see what you can find out. The address is 348 south main street

4764
06:13:00,220 --> 06:13:04,619
The muller case goes before the grand jury next week and the da does not want any egg on his face

4765
06:13:05,580 --> 06:13:08,299
Then get out to the railroad depot on santa fe avenue

4766
06:13:09,180 --> 06:13:14,139
We have another poor unfortunate found this morning beside a railroad line. Yeah, at what point is it like?

4767
06:13:15,099 --> 06:13:18,459
Right skipper, this is a serial killer

4768
06:13:20,189 --> 06:13:22,750
My partner just doesn't seem to want to connect those dots

4769
06:13:23,630 --> 06:13:25,630
No, it's all just coincidences. There's

4770
06:13:26,430 --> 06:13:30,509
steve's taking the wedding rings and just letting their throats and choking them with

4771
06:13:31,470 --> 06:13:33,470
And deirdre muller's ring

4772
06:13:34,569 --> 06:13:37,610
All right, that is going to be it for tonight

4773
06:13:39,340 --> 06:13:41,340
Uh, I will

4774
06:13:42,540 --> 06:13:45,099
Today is thursday

4775
06:13:45,099 --> 06:13:48,540
Tomorrow's friday. I will probably i'll see you guys tomorrow

4776
06:13:49,439 --> 06:13:53,080
We'll do it again tomorrow

4777
06:13:53,080 --> 06:13:55,400
We will do we'll start we'll just keep I think

4778
06:13:57,049 --> 06:13:59,049
How far how close am I to being?

4779
06:13:59,610 --> 06:14:09,529
To the end of the game. I did not finish red dead 2

4780
06:14:10,939 --> 06:14:14,939
I'm very far pretty far. Wow, so this is a big this is a long game, huh?

4781
06:14:20,939 --> 06:14:24,139
Uh would is this something that could be done in like another?

4782
06:14:25,180 --> 06:14:27,180
Like six to eight hour stream

4783
06:14:31,680 --> 06:14:34,040
Two more streams

4784
06:14:34,040 --> 06:14:38,409
Well, can I even can I look?

4785
06:14:38,409 --> 06:14:40,270
Oh, okay. There you go

4786
06:14:40,270 --> 06:14:43,209
13 out of 26

4787
06:14:43,349 --> 06:14:46,090
35 game completion. Holy shit. This game is long

4788
06:14:48,659 --> 06:14:51,000
13

4789
06:14:51,000 --> 06:14:54,509
Well, okay

4790
06:14:54,509 --> 06:14:56,509
Depends on how many jokes you make

4791
06:14:59,740 --> 06:15:01,740
All right. Well, we'll see how far we get tomorrow

4792
06:15:04,970 --> 06:15:06,970
We'll probably start it on the same time

4793
06:15:08,240 --> 06:15:10,560
two to three ish pacific, which is

4794
06:15:11,740 --> 06:15:14,299
Five to six ish eastern something like that

4795
06:15:19,279 --> 06:15:21,279
But i'm having fun. This is a fun game

4796
06:15:25,880 --> 06:15:27,880
Take your current time and double it

4797
06:15:28,279 --> 06:15:30,279
So, I mean so probably two more streams

4798
06:15:31,740 --> 06:15:34,459
We'll see we'll see how you guys are gauging it tomorrow

4799
06:15:35,259 --> 06:15:39,819
Because I can just at least three things to hop between over the next week or two

4800
06:15:47,689 --> 06:15:49,069
But yeah

4801
06:15:49,069 --> 06:15:51,069
Uh, I will catch you guys tomorrow

4802
06:15:51,470 --> 06:15:53,560
Right where we left off here

4803
06:15:53,560 --> 06:15:55,560
And let's do the bits

4804
06:15:55,950 --> 06:16:01,099
Thanks for sticking around. See you tomorrow and we drop that out of the way

4805
06:16:05,180 --> 06:16:07,180
Let's head back here

4806
06:16:08,560 --> 06:16:09,439

Well, i'd watch the stream, but unfortunately I have schoolwork to do at any rate

4811
06:16:19,470 --> 06:16:22,590
I'm glad you settled and it seems like you're really beginning to enjoy yourself and relax

4812
06:16:23,470 --> 06:16:24,669

That's happened so far

4824
06:17:08,409 --> 06:17:19,880
I i'm pretty sure it's getting to be book level here. I think we're getting to be at like book level

4825
06:17:20,279 --> 06:17:32,090
Oh, if we drop some frames. Yeah, we're fine though. Jim davis already has 10 books

4826
06:17:32,490 --> 06:17:36,810
At what point is the garfield the monday killer gonna have the same amount of content as jim davis published?

4827
06:17:42,619 --> 06:17:46,810
I think we're getting there pretty soon

4828
06:17:46,810 --> 06:17:49,049
Uh, but anyways, that just was a thought that uh

4829
06:17:50,090 --> 06:17:52,400
Jumped up into my brain there

4830
06:17:52,479 --> 06:17:56,799
Anyways, you ever look on that rooting hooting tooting high fluting noisy shooting red dead

4831
06:17:57,689 --> 06:17:59,689
Oh, what you're playing la noir

35 dollars we touched upon it

4882
06:22:09,880 --> 06:22:12,520

4883
06:22:13,759 --> 06:22:15,919
Bit donation. So thank you so much hawkeye

Uh, they're they're shushing they're saying epic is an epic word, I guess

4886
06:22:32,520 --> 06:22:35,799
Uh hawkeye of mine again gave 19 dollars

4887
06:22:37,659 --> 06:22:41,840
So that puts you up there man. You also gave 12 dollars

4891
06:23:00,299 --> 06:23:07,419
Uh, it's actually the ninja but yes, there are the same product is marketed on different infomercials

4892
06:23:09,680 --> 06:23:12,240
Same exact concept and it's so easy to use it really is

4893
06:23:13,419 --> 06:23:27,709
You just blend it and you turn it upside down take the top off and drink out of it sponsored sponsored by ninja

4894
06:23:28,590 --> 06:23:31,080
Uh, no, not quite but thanks a lot, man

4895
06:23:31,639 --> 06:23:37,159
Uh fort miner guy. Thanks for the five dollars best streamer to date. I'm glad you think that

4896
06:23:40,189 --> 06:23:42,189
Thank you for the five dollars and that

4897
06:23:42,430 --> 06:23:48,189
Incredibly nice thing to say i'm man 44. Thanks for the one dollar term

4898
06:23:48,189 --> 06:23:55,020
Have you ever tried playing the fighting fantasy books on stream? No, because the fighting fantasy books are very complicated

4899
06:23:56,049 --> 06:23:57,310
And

4900
06:23:57,310 --> 06:23:59,150
I don't know if they transition

4901
06:23:59,150 --> 06:24:03,310
Well to being on video because it's a it's an actual book in dice and

4902
06:24:04,029 --> 06:24:07,950
It would be very very hard for me to learn that and stream it at the same time

4903
06:24:08,189 --> 06:24:10,750
I just I don't know if that would be good stream content

4904
06:24:14,799 --> 06:24:19,759
But if you're curious fighting fantasy is the source is the sorcery. It's made by the same person

4905
06:24:20,159 --> 06:24:28,500
If you're curious of what they're asking here, but thank you. I just don't think it would

4906
06:24:29,200 --> 06:24:34,860
Transition well, but thank you. I'm in for the one dollar

4907
06:24:35,599 --> 06:24:40,299
Uh, thank you the long egg for the five dollars here. Thank you long egg

4908
06:24:40,299 --> 06:24:41,419
I have surgery at 6 a.m

4909
06:24:41,419 --> 06:24:43,580
Tomorrow and having your stream tonight is helping me out a lot

4910
06:24:44,220 --> 06:24:47,259
You're amazing and I can't wait for the green screen stream neither. Can I?

4911
06:24:48,689 --> 06:24:50,979
It should be a ton of fun

4912
06:24:50,979 --> 06:24:52,659
Happening pretty soon

4913
06:24:52,659 --> 06:24:57,599
I'll let you guys know the exact date, but I need to lock it down for either this weekend

4914
06:24:57,599 --> 06:24:59,599
Like I said, or probably monday or tuesday

4915
06:25:00,580 --> 06:25:06,819
Uh, but good luck on your surgery. I'm not sure if it's um, anything that's uh serious or

4916
06:25:07,790 --> 06:25:13,979
A difficult surgery or anything, but good luck to you. Wish you the best. Thank you so much for the five dollars

4917
06:25:19,779 --> 06:25:21,779
Uh, we also have

4918
06:25:21,779 --> 06:25:26,669
Hawkeye of mine gave the twelve dollars earlier at the top of all the other money

4919
06:25:27,619 --> 06:25:32,099
But for the twelve dollar message here is well here's for my next bit badge

4920
06:25:32,099 --> 06:25:34,740
And i'm super stoked to have gotten to see the la noir streams come back

4921
06:25:35,380 --> 06:25:39,939
You're getting great interrogations. Have a good one germa and I love all the germs in chat

4922
06:25:40,659 --> 06:25:42,799

Thank you

4927
06:25:53,619 --> 06:25:55,869
And I think i'm getting the hang of it

4928
06:25:55,869 --> 06:25:58,029
Once I figured out that you just have to find the thing

4929
06:25:58,750 --> 06:26:03,630
The one thing it's not like oh, let's I'm I investigated the crime scene. I have to talk about all those things

4930
06:26:05,389 --> 06:26:07,229
I'm I I get it

4931
06:26:07,229 --> 06:26:09,659
It's a lot of fun

4932
06:26:09,659 --> 06:26:13,419
Thank you so much. Okay. Thank you wave let for the four dollars and 20 cents

Germa go back and watch rat movie 2 real quick

4938
06:26:28,959 --> 06:26:33,680
That video was uploaded on my birthday and my name is michael and I couldn't have asked for a better gift in case

4939
06:26:33,680 --> 06:26:35,680
You don't read resub messages

4940
06:26:37,740 --> 06:26:39,099
uh

4941
06:26:39,099 --> 06:26:44,939
I would be breaking my number one rule. Unfortunately, uh kirenski. I I don't I will not watch rat movie on stream

4942
06:26:48,049 --> 06:26:50,049
Go watch it quick

4943
06:26:51,709 --> 06:26:54,029

4944
06:26:54,029 --> 06:26:57,869
sad faces

4945
06:26:57,869 --> 06:26:59,869
You already did you didn't know it. When did I do that?

4946
06:27:02,340 --> 06:27:04,610
Well, listen michael

4947

06:27:21,580 --> 06:27:25,700
Rat movie anniversary stream or we're gonna revolt

4952
06:27:26,340 --> 06:27:31,630
But now happy birthday

4953
06:27:31,630 --> 06:27:37,599
Was I was I shitfaced when I when we watched it? I had to have been right?

4954
06:27:38,240 --> 06:27:43,490
How do you still have it memorized?

4955
06:27:44,419 --> 06:27:47,220
It's only like four lines and I recorded it

4956
06:27:49,889 --> 06:27:58,610
How the hell do you remember that thing that was three sentences that you recorded it was on the wasp stream

4957
06:28:03,169 --> 06:28:07,169
You're always drunk when you stream. That's your gimmick. I never ever

4958
06:28:08,400 --> 06:28:10,799
Maybe like once every two months

4959
06:28:11,439 --> 06:28:14,240
Once every like two or three months. I'll have a couple of drinks

4960
06:28:15,919 --> 06:28:21,919
Or drink two bottles of champagne or like a bottle of liquor like for labo. Look it happens sometimes

4961
06:28:28,639 --> 06:28:30,639
Once every month you aren't drunk

4962
06:28:31,520 --> 06:28:35,279
Oh my lord, but happy birthday karen ski

4963
06:28:39,169 --> 06:28:41,729
Uh redhead arama. Thanks for the one dollar. I love all your content

4964
06:28:41,729 --> 06:28:44,610
I usually just watch vods and videos, but I popped in to say keep it up

4965
06:28:45,250 --> 06:28:47,090
You're great. Seems good

4966
06:28:47,090 --> 06:28:48,849
Thank you redhead arama

4967
06:28:48,849 --> 06:28:50,849
Glad you can enjoy

4968
06:28:51,340 --> 06:28:55,180
Watching the streams even when they're not live or the videos that are on the second channel

4969
06:28:57,229 --> 06:28:59,470
Thank you for even participating at all. Thank you

4970
06:29:00,689 --> 06:29:06,779
And it's good to see you again. We don't talk about the labo streams. Well, I had fun

4971
06:29:08,299 --> 06:29:12,299
My favorite take from the labo streams was the first night that I did it

4972
06:29:12,299 --> 06:29:15,419
I was getting I was like drunk and I was having a ton of fun

4973
06:29:16,299 --> 06:29:21,250
and then the next time it was like people were yelling at me and people being very mean to me and

4974
06:29:21,729 --> 06:29:23,810
I wasn't drunk and somebody said dude

4975
06:29:23,889 --> 06:29:27,889
You were just having fun the first night and we weren't and you just didn't care because you were drunk

4976
06:29:28,130 --> 06:29:34,259
And I was laughing my ass off about it. Like i'm having so much fun and everyone's like this is awful

4977
06:29:37,200 --> 06:29:43,729
Not everybody just like 20 percent of everybody I would do it again, too

4978
06:29:43,810 --> 06:29:46,770
I'm not kidding if there was if there was another labo, I would build it tomorrow

4979
06:29:48,299 --> 06:29:52,380
Just wait until the stupid car comes out and I do that again for like eight hours

4980
06:29:57,459 --> 06:30:01,409
I'm going to do it again. But this time i'm gonna do it like in the wind

4981
06:30:02,819 --> 06:30:05,060
I'll go on location and try to build the labo

4982
06:30:05,700 --> 06:30:20,500
On some mountain in nevada and like just extreme winds and try to do it. But thank you

4983
06:30:21,060 --> 06:30:23,459
Thank you hawkeye of mine again for three dollars

4984
06:30:25,549 --> 06:30:30,669
Uh, your stream's addictive man. I gave my goodbye bits but stuck around so here's the rest of my pocket change again

4985
06:30:31,500 --> 06:30:39,819
Love you and all the germs here, too. I just i'm just glad you're having fun. I'm happy that you can

4986
06:30:40,540 --> 06:30:41,979
Sit here and enjoy it

4987
06:30:41,979 --> 06:30:46,209
Because I enjoy it too

4988
06:30:46,209 --> 06:30:47,729
It's out right now

4989
06:30:47,729 --> 06:30:51,250
Wait, wait, wait, hold on the the vehicle kit is out right now

4990
06:30:54,130 --> 06:30:55,709
Okay

4991
06:30:55,709 --> 06:30:59,549
I know what we're doing. I know what we're doing this like weekend after the green screen scream

4992
06:31:02,939 --> 06:31:05,259
It came out in september. Oh boy. Okay

4993
06:31:06,930 --> 06:31:11,650
Yeah

4994
06:31:11,650 --> 06:31:13,650
You you shouldn't have told me that

4995
06:31:15,330 --> 06:31:22,849
I'm gonna be the only guy on twitch that's built them all if you recommend any rpgs. Absolutely chrono trigger

4996
06:31:23,330 --> 06:31:25,819
super mario rpg, uh

4997
06:31:26,619 --> 06:31:29,250
lost odyssey, um

4998
06:31:31,139 --> 06:31:38,669
Chrono cross except not really you really have to be into it. That's pretty much it

4999
06:31:42,619 --> 06:31:44,619
Undertale that's another that's good, too

5000
06:31:45,180 --> 06:31:51,900
Just don't ever type undertale into google because you'll you just play it just play it and don't like go go look up anything

5001
06:31:52,619 --> 06:31:54,799
Just enjoy it for what it is

5002
06:31:57,680 --> 06:32:00,880
Sounds like i'll be playing some of those. Oh, they're some of the best rpgs ever made

5003
06:32:01,439 --> 06:32:02,560
Lost odyssey not so much

5004
06:32:02,560 --> 06:32:06,080
But that's just like a recent one that came out on xbox and it was pretty good

5005
06:32:08,770 --> 06:32:11,650
Uh, but dark soul. Thank you for those two dollars dark soul. Hey germa

5006
06:32:11,650 --> 06:32:15,970
You're my first sub and donation ever and when I make more money, I will happily donate more

5007
06:32:17,099 --> 06:32:21,180
You've been through so many phases in my life from when I was at my lower points to my highest peaks

5008
06:32:21,659 --> 06:32:26,619
Keep doing what you're doing because you make my life and so many others full of joy and laughter from even the shortest of streams

5009
06:32:26,939 --> 06:32:35,439
That means a lot. Thank you

5010
06:32:35,439 --> 06:32:37,009
uh

5011
06:32:37,009 --> 06:32:43,650
People that laugh together last together means a lot

5012
06:32:44,369 --> 06:32:52,340
Thank you so much guys and honey chain at the very end. Thanks for the one dollar germa heart. Thank you

5013
06:32:57,759 --> 06:33:01,009
Why am I getting booed?

5014
06:33:01,009 --> 06:33:03,009
Why am I getting booed? Why are you booing me?

5015
06:33:10,689 --> 06:33:15,020
Boo, let's get the credits on here before we end and I will see you guys tomorrow

5016
06:33:16,080 --> 06:33:18,080
With the nintendo labo vehicle kit

5017
06:33:18,799 --> 06:33:20,799
What if I just fucking did that?

5018
06:33:20,959 --> 06:33:22,639
There's a ton of people

5019
06:33:22,639 --> 06:33:25,040
more than half of the audience leaves

5020
06:33:25,840 --> 06:33:30,639
During this portion how fucking mad do you think everyone would be if I turned the stream on and it was the labo

5021
06:33:30,639 --> 06:33:38,000
I was doing it tomorrow

5022
06:33:38,000 --> 06:33:40,000
Part of me kind of wants to do that

5023
06:33:40,159 --> 06:33:41,919
But I don't know

5024
06:33:41,919 --> 06:33:45,680
I got you know, I kind of think i'm just gonna play la noir for like 30 minutes

5025
06:33:46,720 --> 06:33:51,599
And then i'm just gonna turn the webcam on and it's the labo behind me and we're just gonna pivot immediately to it for eight hours

5026
06:34:09,169 --> 06:34:11,169
Don't tell anybody

5027
06:34:11,250 --> 06:34:13,250
Well, uh, what time is it? It's

5028
06:34:13,919 --> 06:34:16,159
I'm maybe I can run to like the store

5029
06:34:17,759 --> 06:34:19,919
vegas never turns off man

5030
06:34:19,919 --> 06:34:24,560
I can I can go to the store at like midnight and like go get anything I want

5031
06:34:28,049 --> 06:34:30,930
Oh, would that be that would be such a I think i'm gonna i'm gonna do it

5032
06:34:31,810 --> 06:34:34,369
That sounds like just stupid enough for me to happy be happy with it

5033
06:34:35,009 --> 06:34:42,180
We'll see we'll see if I can get it

5034
06:34:42,180 --> 06:34:46,340
I'm just gonna play la noir for like 25 minutes and then i'm just gonna pan back

5035
06:34:48,099 --> 06:34:50,099
And that's it build the labo

5036
06:34:52,959 --> 06:34:57,279
Or am I what have I got sucked into yeah, like well it'll just be it'll just be ready behind me

5037
06:34:58,080 --> 06:34:59,840
Over the next couple of days

5038
06:34:59,840 --> 06:35:09,180
All right. We'll try

5039
06:35:09,180 --> 06:35:11,740
But let's run the uh credits

5040
06:35:12,259 --> 06:35:16,000
All the new subs and old subs. Thank you everybody here they come

5041
06:35:18,369 --> 06:35:20,369
Thank you all of you for supporting the stream as always

5042
06:35:22,930 --> 06:35:24,930
Every single one of you are all fucking amazing

5043
06:35:27,169 --> 06:35:29,490
Just start making just make labo puns the whole time

5044
06:35:31,169 --> 06:35:32,540
Yeah

5045
06:35:32,540 --> 06:35:38,779
You guys you guys really gotta keep uh quiet on this though because i'm gonna just reference cardboard and shit for like the first 20 minutes

5046
06:35:49,060 --> 06:35:53,619
I'll like bump into somebody a crash and oh that guy really crashed like crushed like a piece of cardboard

5047
06:35:54,340 --> 06:36:02,430
I mean nintendo really is like such an interesting company making like all these new things that people like played on stream

5048
06:36:08,159 --> 06:36:10,880
This is cool, how did I do this? This is actually part of stream labs

5049
06:36:11,520 --> 06:36:14,419
Um, it's not as detailed as I might like it to be

5050
06:36:17,540 --> 06:36:20,819
If i'm honest because you can really only do one thing and that's just scroll everybody

5051
06:36:20,819 --> 06:36:24,500
I wish it was possible to separate, uh by length of time subscribed

5052
06:36:28,669 --> 06:36:30,669
Why don't I read the credits anymore?

5053
06:36:30,990 --> 06:36:32,990
Well, there's two reasons

5054
06:36:32,990 --> 06:36:34,750
the first reason is

5055
06:36:34,750 --> 06:36:36,750
um, I think the the schtick of

5056
06:36:37,849 --> 06:36:39,310
screaming out

5057
06:36:39,310 --> 06:36:40,669
names

5058
06:36:40,669 --> 06:36:42,669
As as fast as I can

5059
06:36:42,750 --> 06:36:44,830
It's kind of uh, it's kind of over

5060
06:36:45,549 --> 06:36:47,549
And the second thing is there's so many of them though

5061
06:36:50,270 --> 06:36:52,349
So many people are subscribed to this channel now that it's

5062
06:36:53,250 --> 06:36:55,250
Uh, I I can't even fucking believe it

5063
06:37:02,189 --> 06:37:04,430
it's truly truly unbelievable

5064
06:37:08,189 --> 06:37:11,630
And uh, it's not going away. It's just changing

5065
06:37:12,639 --> 06:37:14,799
Because over the next probably month or so

5066
06:37:15,759 --> 06:37:17,759
There's gonna be something that happens at the end of the streams

5067
06:37:18,659 --> 06:37:20,659
In this spot right here

5068
06:37:21,310 --> 06:37:25,790
There's gonna be some fairly fun little interesting things that are not

5069
06:37:26,590 --> 06:37:28,590
It's not gonna be oh i'm gonna

5070
06:37:28,750 --> 06:37:34,029
Pick out some subs and they're like they're i'm gonna like shout them out. No, it'll be just something interesting

5071
06:37:34,590 --> 06:37:52,240
So there will be something fun at the end of streams that includes all the people that subscribe during that stream

5072
06:37:52,880 --> 06:37:58,560
You touched on this before I remember

5073
06:37:58,639 --> 06:38:01,549
yeah

5074
06:38:01,549 --> 06:38:04,990
it's tough because I really I want people to understand that like I really

5075
06:38:05,610 --> 06:38:07,610
appreciate and care that they're

5076
06:38:07,790 --> 06:38:09,790
Giving me their hard-earned money every month

5077
06:38:10,349 --> 06:38:15,790
Some of you guys like I'm treated like a netflix subscription, right? Like it's just people have been subscribed for years

5078
06:38:16,830 --> 06:38:20,029
And I never wanted people to think that I just oh, hey, thanks. Bye

5079
06:38:20,750 --> 06:38:24,180
That's why but I did something about just reading names

5080
06:38:25,060 --> 06:38:27,060
Doesn't do enough for me anymore

5081
06:38:27,380 --> 06:38:30,180
I'd like to try to do something fun

5082
06:38:30,180 --> 06:38:32,340
So just give me some time. I'll figure it out

5083
06:38:42,259 --> 06:38:49,619
But much love to you all

5084
06:38:49,619 --> 06:38:52,659
When is season five coming out season five of what?

5085
06:38:57,470 --> 06:38:59,630
Give me an attaboy for my support

5086
06:39:02,590 --> 06:39:08,900
Yeah, and I think there's like two different ways to do like subscriptions and bits and everything

5087
06:39:10,479 --> 06:39:13,200
and i've always been of the opinion that i'd like to keep it as

5088
06:39:14,240 --> 06:39:22,060
sort of like away from the stream as possible because my I my adhd is impossible to

5089
06:39:22,779 --> 06:39:26,139
Keep up with and i'd like to have them kind of just separated

5090
06:39:26,779 --> 06:39:31,740
in a way

5091
06:39:31,740 --> 06:39:35,540
If that makes sense, I hope it does

5092
06:39:35,540 --> 06:39:40,939
Can't wait for the season of fortnight. Are they in like season six or seven of fortnight?

5093
06:39:41,419 --> 06:39:49,580
I'm subbed to other people and when they read messages as they're sent, it's really out of place

5094
06:39:50,540 --> 06:39:52,540
well, I mean it really depends because I mean

5095
06:39:53,340 --> 06:39:55,419
the the only issue I ever had with it was

5096
06:39:56,369 --> 06:40:02,209
You know when when it's one person when it's two people, okay, I mean whatever that's easy to do

5097
06:40:02,849 --> 06:40:06,209
when it turns into like a hundred two hundred people potentially on a stream, it's

5098
06:40:07,419 --> 06:40:13,979
You know had a sub message notification comes up potentially every you know, 30 to 40 seconds every minute every two minutes

5099
06:40:15,169 --> 06:40:19,569
I've had streams where 400 people subscribed and it was like holy shit

5100
06:40:22,099 --> 06:40:24,099
And it's it's hard to balance between

5101
06:40:24,099 --> 06:40:25,220
I mean

5102
06:40:25,220 --> 06:40:29,779
I want people to know that I care and that I thank them and that they it means a fucking lot to me

5103
06:40:29,779 --> 06:40:31,700
but at the same time

5104
06:40:31,700 --> 06:40:32,819
there's

5105
06:40:32,819 --> 06:40:35,619
There's a stream to do you know what I mean? I would like to stream

5106
06:40:37,860 --> 06:40:39,540
It's something I think about a lot

5107
06:40:39,540 --> 06:40:44,779
The animation froze what did it?

5108
06:40:45,020 --> 06:40:54,299
So that's why over the years i've tried to come up with things to do like the end of the stream here

5109
06:40:54,459 --> 06:40:56,459
We sit and we relax and talk about you know

5110
06:40:56,459 --> 06:41:01,819
all the people that have donated money and I want to touch upon them and the subscription credits and

5111
06:41:02,779 --> 06:41:07,790
There'll always be something like that. I just have to figure out as if the channel continues to grow

5112
06:41:09,150 --> 06:41:11,470
more solutions and more things to do to try

5113
06:41:16,799 --> 06:41:17,840
but uh

5114
06:41:17,840 --> 06:41:22,639
That is for another day. I will see you guys tomorrow for the nintendo labo stream

5115
06:41:24,700 --> 06:41:26,700
I'm gonna piss a lot of people off

5116
06:41:30,130 --> 06:41:36,590
It's it has to happen though. Thanks a lot guys. See you tomorrow

5117
06:41:37,569 --> 06:41:39,569
Take care. Have a great rest of your night
