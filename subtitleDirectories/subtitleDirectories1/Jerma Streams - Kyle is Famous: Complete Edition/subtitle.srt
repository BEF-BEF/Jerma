1
00:00:04,089 --> 00:00:11,419
You know what else I want to do? Hi, sorry if I startled you. Um, the whole wrestling,

2
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:16,870
hey, what song is this thing? Does anybody know? Remember when we did that video game sound effect

3
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:25,429
thing where I had to figure out what game it was from or what character did it from? Oh, here's a

4
00:00:25,429 --> 00:00:33,619
sound effect. And what is that? What's that from? Are there more of those? I want to do one of those.

5
00:00:33,619 --> 00:00:47,460
Is there is there a good one? There are a few more of those. If any of you guys know any,

6
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:55,140
there are mods if you can get me a good one. One that I haven't done. That'd be fun to do.

7
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:11,689
It's sporkle. Yeah, it would have to be something that they can play sound effects through the

8
00:01:11,689 --> 00:01:31,659
browser. What's what's sporkle? I mean, look this up. Sporkle. It's, it's just a trivia site.

9
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:35,659
No, I don't want to do trivia. I want to do sound effects. Then I have to guess what the sound is.

10
00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:51,159
Okay. It looks like Kyle is famous as one. So I'm going to open it. Give some time to maybe get a

11
00:01:51,159 --> 00:02:22,099
couple of these fun websites. It's getting loud. All right, play. What you're describing is true.

12
00:02:22,099 --> 00:02:32,439
No, but it's not trivia though. Trivia would be this plumber back in 1985 or 1983 got his start

13
00:02:32,439 --> 00:02:35,560
jumping on goombas. And it'd be, oh, okay. That's I know that. Let me see what it is.

14
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:52,280
Search it up on sporkle. You piece of shit. Sporkle is based and pog. All right. Hold on.

15
00:02:53,159 --> 00:02:57,909
Do they have what I'm describing? Hold on. I want to find the one I want to find.

16
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:25,580
Hold on. They do. They have that. All right. Okay. Okay. Okay. Sporkle is cracked. Do I need

17
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:51,879
an account? Wait, what? Is this for real? Okay. Hold on a second. I have to turn off ad blocker.

18
00:03:52,759 --> 00:04:17,139
Okay. The play that is not cool. This is like, hold on. I guess it is. Play quiz. Hold on.

19
00:04:17,139 --> 00:04:25,660
Hurdle. You should do hurdle. All right. Here's what we're going to do. I'm going to I'm going

20
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:29,660
to play Kyle is famous. I'm not the stream is going to be not two hours long guys. We'll get

21
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:34,230
a couple of good ones. But I got to I got to do something. I got it. We'll curate a few.

22
00:04:34,790 --> 00:05:04,899
All right. I'm back. Capture this. There it is. Okay. So this is a choose your own adventure

23
00:05:04,899 --> 00:05:10,009
game where you have to make decisions. You have to make choices. I said I was going to fix the

24
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:23,129
camera but I didn't. Okay. Here we go. Somebody said they went to McDonald's. They enjoyed the

25
00:05:23,129 --> 00:05:26,410
double cheeseburger and the four piece nuggets that they ordered. So I thought I would follow

26
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:30,250
German's advice and offer my thanks to the chef. The lady at the register just stared at me like

27
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:41,100
I had two heads. Oh, come on. This is voice acting is famous. Okay. Sure. Tell me if it's

28
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:48,939
too loud. Kyle is host of the most popular talk show in recent memory. Stay up late with Kyle.

29
00:05:50,069 --> 00:05:58,550
Okay. What are my choices? Stay up late with Kyle has grown in popularity quickly in the last year

30
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:07,129
and the public has noticed. Okay. Inside has called Kyle a most excellent dumpy white man.

31
00:06:08,379 --> 00:06:16,920
All right. Cool. Top tech noted that Kyle is inspiring youth to explore stem fields.

32
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:22,759
Is this AI? Is this randomly generated? Most other talk shows are dedicated to discussing

33
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:30,149
Kyle and his personal details. This has to be randomly generated, right? Most online videos

34
00:06:30,149 --> 00:06:39,079
are best of clips taken from Kyle's latest broadcast. Okay. The eye of the world is upon

35
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:48,360
Kyle. Okay. Tonight is Kyle's most important guest interview yet. All right. Stay up late

36
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:54,279
with Kyle will be featuring Rachel May. She is a kind and lovely. I have to click on this.

37
00:06:56,819 --> 00:07:01,620
She is dear to the hearts of many. This interview requires preparation.

38
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:14,230
Okay. Wait, what did I miss? No, no, no, we're good. Kyle cracked his eyes open knowing today

39
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:18,709
is his last chance to prepare for the interview. Okay. So I got a show. I got to prepare for the

40
00:07:18,709 --> 00:07:24,709
interview. I got an interview to do. Let's go. Kyle has 30 hours left. He must choose his actions

41
00:07:24,709 --> 00:07:36,170
wisely. Okay. Okay. First decision in the morning was made wisely wither away or exit the bed. I

42
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:41,850
mean, we're going to exit the bed. Kyle ex exited his bed and took a quick glance around his bedroom.

43
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:50,420
Uh scavenge. Kyle quickly crouched down on the floor realizing his immediate need for bugs.

44
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:55,620
Kyle started to pick between the fuzz of his bedroom carpet hoping to catch a stray beetle or

45
00:07:55,620 --> 00:08:04,579
two. Okay. Soon he had a small handful of various insects dead and alive. I eat them. Kyle threw back

46
00:08:04,579 --> 00:08:10,420
his head and crammed the sticky wriggling mass into his mouth. He felt refreshed. I did that for

47
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:23,100
five hours. Wait, wait, hold on. There's a system in this game where. All right. I did that for

48
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:30,709
six hours. All right. Open the closet. It was dark and he could only really see his hanging shirts.

49
00:08:30,709 --> 00:08:34,789
Choose an outfit. Kyle decided to take some time to choose the perfect outfit.

50
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:49,580
Suit of armor. Kyle was unsure of what exactly to decide to wear his armor, but it felt like the

51
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:55,580
right thing to do. Okay. After much squeezing and sweating, Kyle managed to wrap the metal suit

52
00:08:55,580 --> 00:09:05,019
around his dumpy self, which would be hard. I get it. I get it. Trust me. All right. So the desk

53
00:09:08,299 --> 00:09:16,889
write notes for the interview. Kyle wrote down his first question. Um, I are you a mother?

54
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:24,100
Kyle wrote down his second question. You ever eaten a raw whole egg? Sure. Kyle wrote down

55
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:29,299
his third question. That's your funniest story. Kyle wrote down his last question.

56
00:09:30,019 --> 00:09:34,789
What's your guilty pleasure? Kyle ripped his page of notes out of the notebook and got up

57
00:09:34,789 --> 00:09:45,019
from the desk. Okay. Actually, am I wasting time here? Should I not be doing this? All right. Draw

58
00:09:45,019 --> 00:09:52,100
open the side draw of his desk and grab one of the items stored there. Uh, a key. Kyle grabbed

59
00:09:52,100 --> 00:10:00,379
the small key he kept in his desk. Cool. This is not bakery simulator anymore. No, it's not.

60
00:10:00,379 --> 00:10:07,940
What about use the key? Oh yeah. Get the change to Kyle scooped up the change scattered around.

61
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:13,370
All right. So let's go back to the room. I did everything. Let's go. Okay. We have to exit.

62
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:20,629
I only have four hours. I think I have to leave. Check the lock. I walked over to the strange door

63
00:10:20,629 --> 00:10:26,860
in the hallway, but found quickly that the door was walking around eating bugs and sitting in.

64
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:41,129
It's been 30 hours. I have to leave the apartment. Uh, visit the tech store by batteries with change.

65
00:10:41,129 --> 00:10:49,659
I can do that. Okay. Now what? Kyle hurried to the set. Sitting across from his host chair was a

66
00:10:49,659 --> 00:10:57,860
glamorous woman with an air of genuineness. As Kyle approached her, Rachel looked up and smiled.

67
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:03,779
Okay. Good evening, Kyle. She said, looking him in the eyes. I've been looking forward to being here.

68
00:11:03,779 --> 00:11:10,860
Last second batteries. That's right. Kyle responded. Um, well, this is the funny like,

69
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:15,720
this is the funny answer. So we're going to do the regular answer. And I as well. Rachel

70
00:11:15,799 --> 00:11:22,470
answered. Kyle extending his hand and greeting. You are a most welcome guest. Shake hands. After

71
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:26,789
other mild exchanges of pleasantries, Kyle and Rachel were prompted to take their places for

72
00:11:26,789 --> 00:11:31,830
the broadcast. Okay. The moment after seating, the studio lights brightened and the cameras clicked

73
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:40,600
on start broadcast. Good evening, everyone. Said Kyle looking at the camera. Welcome back to stay

74
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:50,259
up late with Kyle. Kyle vomited all of the horrible things he had eaten earlier onto the floor.

75
00:11:50,259 --> 00:11:55,139
Rachel looked at Kyle concerned, gave a couple coughs and decided to play it cool and keep the

76
00:11:55,139 --> 00:12:03,559
show running. Kyle stopped, then vomited again, then continued with a shaky voice. Tonight,

77
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:11,139
I have the pleasure of interviewing the lovely Rachel may who needs no more introduction.

78
00:12:11,139 --> 00:12:16,820
Kyle motioned to Rachel who smiled and waved at the camera. Hello, Kyle. She said, I'm glad to be

79
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:27,049
here. Well, you finally fixed your mic a lot to discuss. So we might as well dive right in,

80
00:12:27,049 --> 00:12:32,309
finally said Kyle. All right, let's go. I'm very ready, said Rachel with a winning smile.

81
00:12:32,309 --> 00:12:38,250
I can't just draw. Kyle produced the notes he had taken earlier. All right. You're eating a whole egg.

82
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:45,690
Hey, Rachel ever eaten a raw egg whole? Asked Kyle. I'm like shell and all. Asked Rachel.

83
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:52,220
Kyle continued. I had like a lot. It's really bad, though. So sometimes I spit it back up.

84
00:12:52,220 --> 00:13:03,750
You guys want to hear my mouth going like there was a silence. It actually gets easier the more

85
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:11,990
you do it. Continued Kyle without losing momentum. So don't start. I say Rachel chose not to end.

86
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:14,629
Where the fuck do we end up? Where are we? Where are we? Where are we? Where are we?

87
00:13:14,629 --> 00:13:20,940
I think the story I always remember is the first time I tried to make dinner for my family.

88
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:28,620
In the soup I made, I swapped out the water with milk and tipped the whole jar of salt in the pot.

89
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:34,870
While my family was sick from trying to eat it, I swiped their things and locked myself in my room.

90
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:43,690
OK. Rachel laughed elegantly. Kyle decided to move on. Kyle asked another question.

91
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:48,169
What's your guilty pleasure? We all have one. What's your guilty pleasure?

92
00:13:48,169 --> 00:14:26,100
Hold on. Let me do this right. You need to be able to see the microphone.

93
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:41,029
Then I got to be like this. Ready? Well, that's an easy answer, said Rachel,

94
00:14:41,029 --> 00:14:49,929
dipping pickles in chocolate sauce. It might sound strange, but it's tangy and sweet at the same time.

95
00:14:49,929 --> 00:14:55,590
I eat it far too often. Rachel smiled sweetly.

96
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:59,269
After reading his final question, Kyle looked up from his paper.

97
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,080
Well, Rachel, he said, I think that's all I was planning on asking you.

98
00:15:06,809 --> 00:15:10,490
If that's the case, Kyle, may I ask you something in return?

99
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:16,860
Asked Rachel, smiling one more time. Why exactly did you decide to wear a suit of armor today?

100
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:22,539
Before Kyle could answer, the cameras shut down. The broadcast was over.

101
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:26,899
Kyle returned home knowing the interview had gone well.

102
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:43,419
But as he lay in bed and drifted to sleep, he felt that perhaps something was still missing.

103
00:15:47,379 --> 00:16:05,320
Did I lose? He's moving like a TikToker. I'm having fun doing this. Can I do the

104
00:16:06,519 --> 00:16:09,320
I'm doing the voices thing still? Is this still funny to you?

105
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:26,970
That was the most unfunny bit. That's welcome. Okay, I'm going to do it one more time.

106
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:31,419
Okay, one more time. That's it. I'm going to get really animated.

107
00:16:31,419 --> 00:17:08,089
Kyle hurried to the set. Sitting across from his host chair was a glamorous woman with an

108
00:17:08,089 --> 00:17:13,609
air of genuineness. As Kyle approached her, Rachel looked up and smiled.

109
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:20,390
Good evening, Kyle, she said, looking him in the eyes. I've been looking forward to being here.

110
00:17:22,519 --> 00:17:31,559
Kyle responded. Kyle stretched his arms wide, tilted his neck upwards and was interrupted by

111
00:17:31,559 --> 00:17:38,390
his producer telling him and Rachel that it was time to start the show. Kyle shoved his producer

112
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:50,980
out of the way, spread his arms wide and began to scream loudly. He began to rotate slowly,

113
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:55,539
screaming throughout, lightly brushing his hands against the faces of Rachel and his producer.

114
00:18:05,099 --> 00:18:10,539
After several minutes, Kyle was finished. He slowly put his hands to his sides and smiled.

115
00:18:13,619 --> 00:18:20,839
I'm ready, said Kyle. Rachel blinked at Kyle, shrugged and walked over to her seat.

116
00:18:22,579 --> 00:18:26,259
A moment after seating, the studio lights brightened and the cameras clicked on.

117
00:18:27,559 --> 00:18:32,920
Good evening, everyone, said Kyle, looking at the camera. Welcome back to Stay Up Late with Kyle.

118
00:18:34,299 --> 00:18:38,140
Kyle vomited all of the horrible things he had eaten earlier onto the floor.

119
00:18:39,779 --> 00:18:44,660
Rachel looked at Kyle, concerned, gave a couple coughs and decided to play it cool and keep the

120
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:50,789
show running. Kyle stopped, then vomited again, then continued with a shaky voice.

121
00:18:52,309 --> 00:18:59,109
Tonight, I have the pleasure of interviewing the lovely Rachel May, who needs no more introduction.

122
00:19:00,599 --> 00:19:03,720
Kyle motioned to Rachel, who smiled and waved at the camera.

123
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:06,599
Hello, Kyle. She said, I'm glad to be here.

124
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:17,480
Why would sound come out and I don't move my mouth? All right, I'm done. I'm done with this one.

125
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:26,069
Fuck, I want to play this game, though. I kind of want to. Let me just play it for a minute.

126
00:19:26,069 --> 00:19:42,119
Let me play the game for a minute. It's actually very well done voice acting.

127
00:19:42,119 --> 00:19:50,089
Well, I'm sure we'll have a lot to discuss. So we might as well dive right in, said Kyle.

128
00:19:50,089 --> 00:19:54,089
This is not bakery. No, this is not still bakery simulator. Wait, I'm still like,

129
00:19:55,210 --> 00:20:04,859
voice. Hold on. This is the same person, the same guy that did Gabriel. He did who did the bosses

130
00:20:04,859 --> 00:20:09,460
from ultra kill. Are you shitting me? I told you that fucking guy was talented.

131
00:20:14,339 --> 00:20:23,740
What happened? Why does this look so weird? No, this looks what happened. Oh, there we go.

132
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:36,779
Okay, I'm going to play. I'm going to play for like 10 minutes. Can I play? Leave me alone.

133
00:20:36,779 --> 00:20:45,430
I'm playing. I'm very ready, said Rachel with a winning smile. Kyle produced the notes he had

134
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:55,369
taken earlier. Okay, I'm not starting with this. I'm not starting with this. What's your guilty

135
00:20:55,369 --> 00:21:04,460
pleasure? We all have one. What's your guilty pleasure? Oh, well, that's an easy answer,

136
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:14,980
said Rachel, dipping pickles in chocolate sauce. That's really not that weird. That's really not

137
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:22,650
that weird. It might sound strange, but it's tangy and sweet at the same time. I eat it far too often.

138
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:26,569
Rachel smiled sweetly. People put all kinds of weird shit on pickles. Okay,

139
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:33,910
Kyle asked another question. What's a funny story? You've been involved in a lot of different things,

140
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:40,789
said Kyle. But what's your funniest story? Well, that's a great question, Kyle, said Rachel.

141
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:47,099
I think the story I always remember is the first time I tried to make dinner for my family.

142
00:21:47,099 --> 00:21:54,500
Okay. In the soup I made, I swapped out the water with milk and tipped the whole jar of salt in the

143
00:21:54,500 --> 00:22:01,160
pot. Oh, while my family was sick from trying to eat it, I swiped their things and locked myself

144
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:10,259
in my room. Oh, that's what I missed and I skipped. Rachel laughed elegantly. Kyle decided to move.

145
00:22:10,339 --> 00:22:14,819
Yeah, he moved on. I asked another question. Are you a mother? Rachel, I and many others. Did I do

146
00:22:14,819 --> 00:22:21,059
something wrong? To know, are you a mother, Kyle? Well, being a single woman with a career, she

147
00:22:21,059 --> 00:22:29,240
answered. That's not something that has crossed my mind. Who is this again? Who is this? Who is

148
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:36,460
this person? Rachel smiled genuinely at Kyle. Re-do the whole game. Oh, right. Very reasonable indeed,

149
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:44,500
said Kyle. Kyle asked, Hey Rachel, have you ever eaten a raw egg whole? Asked Kyle. Um, like

150
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:50,660
shell and all? Asked Rachel. Kyle continued. I have, it's bad. I think I spit it back up.

151
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:55,140
There was a silence. It actually gets easier the more you do it. Yeah, I remember this.

152
00:22:55,140 --> 00:23:00,579
Rachel chose not to answer. After reading. Okay. Well, Rachel. That's how we're planning.

153
00:23:00,579 --> 00:23:07,059
If that's the case, Kyle, may I ask you something in return? Oh, why exactly did you decide to wear

154
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:12,980
a suit of armor today? Okay. Before Kyle could answer, the camera shut down. Kyle returned.

155
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:18,019
All right. I screwed the whole thing up. I'm going back. Repeat. Reset. No, no, no, no, no, no, no,

156
00:23:18,019 --> 00:23:24,359
Kyle. No, no, no, no, no, no. I screwed it up. As Kyle approached her, Rachel looked up and smiled.

157
00:23:24,359 --> 00:23:31,059
Okay, here we go. I'm going to wither away. Kyle decided to stay put and wither away. I wasted way

158
00:23:31,059 --> 00:23:38,250
too much time withered successfully and died. Wait, what is it? Kyle is now a ghost. This does not

159
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:51,140
relieve him of his responsibilities. Oh, okay. All right. So what do I need from here? I'm going

160
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:56,359
to choose an outfit. Kyle decided to take some time to choose the perfect outfit, knowing how

161
00:23:56,359 --> 00:24:03,289
important appearance is. Kyle miraculously crammed his dumpy body into the suit. The chest pockets

162
00:24:03,289 --> 00:24:13,900
were filled with random knickknacks. Okay. So now I think I'm going to leave. Wait, sit at the desk

163
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:25,819
and get the batteries, right? Change. Kyle scooped up the change. Get out, get out, get out, get out.

164
00:24:25,819 --> 00:24:33,829
Okay. Move to the kitchen. Open the fridge. Kyle opened the fridge, intending to find something

165
00:24:33,829 --> 00:24:39,509
to eat. Eat crust on the fridge wall. Eat the fridge. How do you eat? You can't eat the fridge.

166
00:24:39,509 --> 00:24:48,339
Can I? No, I would eat condiments. That'll get like all the gross. I didn't brush my teeth yet

167
00:24:48,339 --> 00:24:54,579
out of my mouth. If there's one thing that will cover that up, it's a bottle of ketchup.

168
00:24:54,579 --> 00:24:59,220
Kyle started to grab condiments from the fridge, squirting them into his mouth with both hands.

169
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:05,380
Okay. Ketchup, horseradish, and mayonnaise entered Kyle's mouth at a rate that soon

170
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:13,420
overwhelmed his ability to swallow. That actually sounds good. I'm not kidding. Kyle spewed the

171
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:19,259
excess condiment slurry across the kitchen, covering the furniture and walls. Okay. Kyle

172
00:25:19,259 --> 00:25:24,299
continued until all of the condiments had been emptied. Not to eat by itself, but just put that

173
00:25:24,299 --> 00:25:31,740
on something. That doesn't sound like a bad combo. All right. I got 10 hours. Check the pantry. Kyle

174
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:38,359
wanted to access the pantry, but found it was locked with a small keyhole. Mayo, horseradish,

175
00:25:38,359 --> 00:25:45,589
and ketchup. That's probably... Horseradish is delicious with anything, and ketchup and mayonnaise

176
00:25:45,589 --> 00:25:50,220
is just Thousand Island dressing. So it's just Thousand Island with a little bit of kick to it.

177
00:25:50,220 --> 00:26:07,380
What's the problem with that? All right. The key is for the pantry, but Thousand Island sucks.

178
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:13,059
Big Mac sauce. Yeah. Kyle wanted to... All right. Yeah, I can't. All right. So let's go back to the

179
00:26:13,059 --> 00:26:22,089
hallway. I only have a few... You gotta get out of the house immediately. Oh, I can haunt.

180
00:26:22,089 --> 00:26:31,400
Kyle felt a sudden pull on his heart. Had he abandoned his job as a ghost? Was he fulfilling

181
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:39,339
his spooky, ethereal role that he'd accepted while lying in bed this morning? Kyle realized he had

182
00:26:39,339 --> 00:26:47,049
no other choice. He must spend his day spooking about. Okay. Kyle decided he should make a plan

183
00:26:47,049 --> 00:26:54,869
about who or where he should spook. At the interview. Kyle thought that it would be best

184
00:26:54,869 --> 00:27:00,779
to continue his daily course. That makes sense. But with a twist. Today, he would still go to

185
00:27:00,779 --> 00:27:06,039
his studio, but instead of conducting an interview, he would haunt. Thousand Island is incredible.

186
00:27:06,039 --> 00:27:12,869
Yeah. What are you guys talking... Thousand Island is good on lots of stuff. Excitedly,

187
00:27:12,869 --> 00:27:17,910
Kyle made his way to the studio early to find the best spot to conduct his ghostly duties.

188
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:21,990
I don't love Thousand Island dressing, but I don't hate it. The studio was empty.

189
00:27:22,069 --> 00:27:27,700
Being so early, the crew wouldn't arrive for several hours. Okay. Kyle gleefully skipped

190
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:33,210
around the building, finding the best spot for himself to hide. Okay. After searching for some

191
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:39,690
time, Kyle decided to hide behind the guest chair. Okay. Rubens, yep. Kyle quickly placed himself

192
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:46,519
down and drew his legs to his chest. Soon, the crew began to arrive and set up for the interview

193
00:27:46,519 --> 00:27:53,369
that night. Invisible to all senses, Kyle went undetected. He watched as cameras were set up,

194
00:27:53,369 --> 00:27:59,640
screens were turned on, and pages were flipped. Within an hour, Rachel walked into the studio.

195
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:07,140
This is it. Hey, everyone. Said Rachel, smiling kindly. I'm ready to get prepped. Who do I need

196
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:14,009
to talk to first? Kyle's producer approached her. Thanks for being here, Rachel. You should

197
00:28:14,009 --> 00:28:18,579
really talk to Andrea about makeup first, and then wait for when Kyle arrives. Here I come.

198
00:28:18,579 --> 00:28:24,339
Kyle, knowing he was duping everyone, began to giggle uncontrollably. He's doing a little

199
00:28:24,339 --> 00:28:27,859
bit of trolling. Yeah, I'm doing a little bit of trolling, whatever. It was then that he,

200
00:28:27,859 --> 00:28:35,210
like clockwork, ceased to be a ghost. Why? The studio grew silent. Everyone stared at Kyle,

201
00:28:35,210 --> 00:28:41,579
head down, clutching his legs and giggling at the floor. What is TF? Kyle froze. He had found

202
00:28:41,579 --> 00:28:47,700
himself in a situation he had not encountered before. Kyle started to crawl out of the studio

203
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:55,420
on all fours, hoping his small form would avoid attracting more attention. Why can I not see that?

204
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:59,339
Everyone wordlessly watched as Kyle slowly made his way across the stage,

205
00:28:59,339 --> 00:29:04,279
through the production set and out the door. As soon as he was outside the studio,

206
00:29:04,279 --> 00:29:09,349
Kyle broke into an all out sprint. I still have money. Kyle made his way back to his apartment

207
00:29:09,349 --> 00:29:15,059
as quickly as possible. Kyle sat in his kitchen and processed what had happened during his day.

208
00:29:15,059 --> 00:29:22,599
Am I still dead? He vowed that he would never haunt anything again. How many endings are there?

209
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:35,019
Dude, Kyle is literally me. How we do we got? Oh, we got we have we have the wrestling one.

210
00:29:35,019 --> 00:29:51,740
Should I try the wrestling quiz? I feel like I would do pretty good on it. All right, let me get

211
00:29:51,740 --> 00:30:03,319
it. I'll try I'll try it. I can't promise that I'm going to do well. But I think I'll get probably

212
00:30:03,319 --> 00:30:22,059
half of these. You have a reptilian brain. Okay, sparkle. Let's get it. How do I do this? Tic Tac

213
00:30:22,059 --> 00:30:32,470
trivia. Oh, this is but wait, there's a lot of six letter word in 1980s songs. Okay. Television cakes.

214
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:40,740
This looks fun. Pick that movie. This looks fun. This is fun, isn't it? Let's pick that movie.

215
00:30:47,259 --> 00:31:00,789
Dude, let's go pick that movie. Hold on. Um, how does it work? Let's pick that movie. Can you pick

216
00:31:00,789 --> 00:31:21,690
the movie that fits each clue? Alright, I'm excited. Alright, hold on. Let me get this set up.

217
00:31:21,690 --> 00:31:46,700
The movie quiz. Okay. How do I where is it? Let me close this. So that 100 people left. That's

218
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:54,730
all right. It's fine. Where the fuck is this window? I have so much trouble capturing windows

219
00:31:54,730 --> 00:32:06,180
on stream. It never seems to work the way that I want it to. Where is it? I can see it in my

220
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:32,869
preview, but I can't hold on. Okay, it should be there. Come on. I want to play. It won't show up.

221
00:32:39,559 --> 00:32:43,720
I can see it in the preview, but I can't see it actually on the the window. You're doing your

222
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:56,759
best. Yeah. Make it work. I'm trying. What do you think I'm doing? There it is. So what the fuck?

223
00:32:56,759 --> 00:33:18,359
OBS, what are you doing? It says it's got it. I don't get it. I'll try it again. Hello, it's my

224
00:33:18,359 --> 00:33:41,910
birthday. Someone help dad. It should I should be pulling this. It's just not. Come on. What the

225
00:33:41,910 --> 00:33:58,460
heck? Hold on. Um, let me see if I can do this. Every time this happens, I have to restart OBS.

226
00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:07,829
And I really don't want to do that. I might have to though, because I think it's frozen.

227
00:34:07,829 --> 00:34:14,059
All right. All right. All right. I, I'll be right back. I physically can't capture this.

228
00:34:14,059 --> 00:34:19,900
Unless I restart OBS. None of you leave. If any of you leave, I'll know. If any of you leave,

229
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:25,590
I'll know. Don't go anywhere. If any of you leave, I will know. I'll know. There's 20,000 people.

230
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:30,309
They'd be 20,000 people when I come back. I'll know. I'll be back in 30 seconds. I just have

231
00:34:30,309 --> 00:34:33,849
to turn it off and turn it on again. I'll know. Don't you dare.
