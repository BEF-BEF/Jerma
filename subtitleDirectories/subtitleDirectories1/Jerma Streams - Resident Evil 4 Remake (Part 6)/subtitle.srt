1
00:00:31,739 --> 00:00:37,909
I told you I was going to be precisely on time. I said it. I said I'm going to be on time today.

2
00:00:39,560 --> 00:01:00,710
I was 10 seconds early. It's on time. I don't believe it. What's going on? Well, this time

3
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:15,659
I'm not I'm not on the ground. I am seated this time. I'm not on the ground. I have some changes

4
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:37,349
to my setup. I'm very happy with it. I had a dream you were playing Tears of the Kingdom.

5
00:01:37,909 --> 00:01:55,739
Well, that sounds like a nightmare to me. I'm just kidding around. We finally made it on time.

6
00:01:55,739 --> 00:02:03,290
Uh, give me one second. I want to drink needs a refill. I guess I've been doing this thing.

7
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:11,189
I've been doing water, but like 10% watermelon juice. It's been pretty great. Actually,

8
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:15,830
you get a little bit of flavor, but it's not all sugar and bullshit. It's been pretty great. Give

9
00:02:15,830 --> 00:05:45,259
me one second. Okay. Hi. Uh, that was weird. I hope that doesn't happen again. Otherwise I'm

10
00:05:45,259 --> 00:05:51,100
going to have to figure this out and I'll have to see you another time. Okay. So let me explain.

11
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:58,279
I may have tripped a breaker, but it's not like I'm, I'm just in a different room.

12
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:05,000
It's not like I'm doing any more. I browned out. I had a brownout.

13
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:12,060
How did I overload this? It's not like I added any equipment. What the hell happened?

14
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:21,879
Dude, this, this might happen again. I don't know. I was using the setup for like a couple of hours

15
00:06:21,879 --> 00:06:30,100
yesterday. Maybe the streaming is like pulling extra power and tripping the breaker. Okay. Well,

16
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:36,100
everybody cross your fingers. That doesn't happen again, but, uh, I'm fully prepared. If it does

17
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:40,579
in the event, it does. I'm going to have to do a little bit of investigating

18
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:52,310
road to advanced. I mean, I'm sitting in a recliner right now. I did. It's not like I'm

19
00:06:52,310 --> 00:07:00,839
streaming from a space station. Anyways. Hey, it wouldn't be a stream that I do unless something

20
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:05,079
goes horribly wrong for no reason. Right. I mean that I have to just accept it at this point.

21
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:11,560
Hey guys, I changed my whole setup. Spent the last like few days getting it all set up and all

22
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:18,600
these things. I got a recliner now. I got this cool custom made computer setup. Oh, oh, oh, you,

23
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:28,040
wait, you thought I was going to be able to stream. Time to brown out my breaker. Well,

24
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:31,879
that's actually, that's really good to know because that means that there's

25
00:07:32,839 --> 00:07:37,240
essentially something to do with like the circuit that I'm on. Maybe I have to try plugging into a

26
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:40,759
different outlet. I don't know. I'll have to figure that out. Anyways. Uh, we'll see if it

27
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:46,680
keeps going. If we are fine, we're fine. And if not, if the stream turns off again and hey, it's

28
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:56,660
okay. I'll figure it out. We'll see you another day, but I'm here now and uh, yeah, getting brown

29
00:07:56,660 --> 00:08:09,029
outs in your thirties. Oh, I see the joke. Okay. No, that's all right. All right. We'll find out.

30
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:14,310
Uh, I'm actually kind of scared that it's going to happen again, but anyways, good to see you

31
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:26,759
today. We're going to be playing resident evil four, a separate ways DLC. That's the plan.

32
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:32,500
Don't jinx it. Yeah. I got to keep my mouth shut about this now, but yeah, we're going to play a

33
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:39,669
DLC. I'm streaming from a new setup. Like you said, like you said, like I said, I am officially

34
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:45,139
in a recliner. I will show you, I'll be on cam for a little bit tonight. We are playing a scary game.

35
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:51,769
Everybody say your prayers that we don't get an electrical brown out again. Okay. Well, anyways,

36
00:08:53,769 --> 00:09:02,950
yeah, I'm in a recliner. This is the new setup. Gets me more comfortable. I can actually sit back

37
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:06,470
now because before, I think I mentioned it when I was on the ground. Cause when I, when I was

38
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:11,110
lying on the ground last stream, it was not, I was not even 20% of the way through setting this

39
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:22,090
new setup up, but let's take a look. You want to see? I'll show you. There's the game. I'm going

40
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:26,700
to hit start game and it's going to draw extra power and it's going to turn the computer off.

41
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:32,279
I'm fucking scared to click. Yes. Let go. Oh my God. It scared the shit out of me. You can hear

42
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:40,600
it. I thought my computer browned out. All right, hold on. Here we go. All right. You ready? Here

43
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:54,500
we go. Recliner. I told you I was going to be sitting in a chair. I have this over. This is

44
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:57,299
not the final setup, by the way. And a lot of people were like, wow, you're just in a chair

45
00:09:57,299 --> 00:10:03,370
this time. Look at this background over here. You got a mustache. Yep. Well, whatever you could

46
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:11,720
call it. No Reddit shelf. Hold on. Not done yet. I'm missing two or three very important pieces,

47
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:18,980
but when they get here, oh yeah, I've got a few things I really need to get. I need a different

48
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:23,559
little table over here. I need a whole section. I'm not completed yet. I still have to go get it.

49
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:31,799
Why don't I have the, why am I doing umpire Albertson again? There's a reason. There's a

50
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:40,070
reason. No, I'm not. I'm not an umpire again. I'm just saying there's a reason. I want to have a

51
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:53,299
mustache. Is that, is that so weird? And you look like a mafia boss. Come here. You, come here. Make

52
00:10:53,299 --> 00:10:57,460
the cam smaller. Yeah. I just want to show you my, uh, my cool Pac-Man thing that I got there.

53
00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:06,539
It makes me happy. My hair is a mess. I gotta work on that. Yeah. This is the setup temporarily. It's

54
00:11:06,539 --> 00:11:14,419
not quite there, but it will be shrink this a little. Yeah. I can, I can actually go like this

55
00:11:14,419 --> 00:11:21,639
now. This is how you should be streaming. Those of you streamers that are watching right now.

56
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:28,470
Oh, you're doing it completely wrong. I was doing it wrong for 10 years. Being able to do this. I

57
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:36,039
got the keyboard right here. I got the mouse on a table that's connected to the recliner armchair.

58
00:11:36,039 --> 00:11:43,320
I've got all my little, uh, my little things over here. I've got my knobs over here. You're going to

59
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:51,240
get seasick. Like puke. Please don't turn the fucking, please don't have the computer turned

60
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:57,740
off again. I'm like terrified right now. I went, it's, this is so, of course it has to happen on

61
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:02,659
my stream, right? I sat down, I was wicked relaxed. I was like, Oh, I can't wait to fucking play

62
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:11,110
a Resident Evil's DLC in my new comfortable setup. And now I'm no longer comfortable.

63
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:26,120
Now I'm like, is my computer going to turn all the power off? But Hey, it is what it is. But

64
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:31,639
all right. I'm ready to play. I'm ready to chill and hang out and play the DLC. Look at this. Oh,

65
00:12:31,639 --> 00:12:46,230
yeah. Okay. Separate ways, right? I'm just ready to go. Are we ready? Trim your toenails? Nah,

66
00:12:47,029 --> 00:12:53,539
I'm just going to keep them going. Uh, only separate ways challenges can be earned in the,

67
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:58,379
okay. Yeah. That's fine. Costumes and accessories set in the extras menu will be applied. Yeah.

68
00:12:58,379 --> 00:13:12,379
We already know all this. Wait, different. Whoa, wait, hold on a second. Oh, right. I already have

69
00:13:12,379 --> 00:13:25,110
all these. So what should I do for a costume? Your new setup has a weird camera angle. Well,

70
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:28,710
this is temporary. This is a lot of this is going to move back. You're going to be able to see the

71
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:34,120
Reddit shelf when I decide to do cam, I'm not going to do it every time. Right. But the romantic.

72
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:43,820
Yeah, sure. This is really is, is Leon even in this? I guess so. Isn't it a storyline?

73
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:54,409
And who cares? Let's just go. Uh, I'm retired. So I'm just gonna play on standard. Do pinstripe.

74
00:13:54,409 --> 00:14:16,179
All right. That scene. All right. Those of you that don't know, this takes place at the same

75
00:14:16,179 --> 00:14:24,169
time as the other game. And you cross paths and shit. It's way too loud. I can't even hear

76
00:14:24,169 --> 00:15:02,649
myself talk. Who is? Why is he dancing? I don't know. I think because he knows he's going to

77
00:15:02,649 --> 00:15:21,659
escape. It's just a complete overconfidence. Turn the game up. You got it. Am I? I might

78
00:15:21,659 --> 00:15:42,200
have to change some of the audio adjustments here, though. Oh, I was sick. There's no way

79
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:57,799
to finish a dance. All right. Is it weird that for one second I did not know that was Ada?

80
00:15:57,799 --> 00:16:10,940
I was like, oh, oh, yeah, of course, that was Ada in the costume. Many things. You see,

81
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:20,230
how some annoying monks took everything from me, including the amber, never hidden just before

82
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:30,019
they grabbed me. Well, then lead the way. All right. Here we go. You guys ready? Scary game.

83
00:16:30,019 --> 00:16:38,009
So the camera has to be on this way. All right. I did play this last night just to get the controls

84
00:16:38,009 --> 00:16:41,929
down again. I kind of remember, but I kind of don't. You know that. All right. Let me turn it

85
00:16:41,929 --> 00:16:59,690
up. We're saying it is low. Up all the way. It's weird. I think it's all right now. What do you

86
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:11,740
want with it anyway? Yeah, I think I actually I if I do that too much, I will puke. I actually

87
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:37,779
have to be careful. Is it? No, it's hold. Right. That arc. That's right. I'm going full dad mode.

88
00:17:52,410 --> 00:18:04,180
Boss fight. I hope they give us a boss fight immediately.

89
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:18,099
Then we meet at the church. Let's not make it a funeral.

90
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:25,319
Is that do we actually have to do this right now? Oh, should I have to be ready?

91
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:58,519
Let's beat it. Ada has a machine gun. That's pretty cool. Oh, OK. It has a machine gun.

92
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:15,349
Oh, that's pretty cool. All right. All right. With the black robe, I can parry, right? Oh,

93
00:19:15,349 --> 00:19:29,190
no, it's evade, not parry. C is evade. I might want to change that. Does Ada have like a move

94
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:45,900
where you can punch? Oh, I thought I killed it. I thought it was dead. I don't. Was this in the

95
00:19:45,900 --> 00:20:00,329
original? I don't remember this. I don't run out of bullets. Oh, my God. They're everywhere.

96
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:34,059
Where's the real one? I got there's a real one. You know, died of him. Well, I just killed it.

97
00:20:34,059 --> 00:20:37,740
All right. Where's the map? There's a map. OK, this is my favorite part where you go find every

98
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:53,430
item machine gun. Very cool. Volume is still low. Yeah, that's very strange considering.

99
00:20:54,740 --> 00:21:00,680
I'll turn it up all the way up and I'll figure out later, but we'll just keep it up all the way.

100
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:31,190
Tell me if it's if it's too. Let's see. Oh, that's fine. Standard Andy, right? Hmm. Thank

101
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:44,259
you for telling me this. Five thousand people are about to scream it at me. Can I get in here?

102
00:21:44,259 --> 00:21:56,789
You're covering up the weapon indicator. Oh, I got to go. Can I go up here? Is up here better?

103
00:21:56,789 --> 00:22:15,779
Probably unfathomable. Remember, every time I do a Boston accent, I have to kind of move like this.

104
00:22:15,779 --> 00:22:26,900
Oh, is that gunpowder? Why is that? Why? Control come in. Louise hit the amber, but I've sent him

105
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:42,579
to retrieve it. Control, do you copy? I'm listening. Into some unexpected trouble.

106
00:22:42,579 --> 00:22:50,180
Wesker. Louise is already on route to the church. I'm tracking him every step of the way. Then I

107
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:58,779
suggest you hurry. Copy. Just need to confirm my route first. Heading out to get a visual of the

108
00:22:58,859 --> 00:23:14,700
area. Whoa. All right. Hold on. I tried to run. It's a run. I was trying to sprint because I was

109
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:19,430
going to look around. That scared the shit out of me for some reason. I don't know why.

110
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:37,349
OK, I want to go back down there. I wasn't done. Stick to that. I got to get over there.

111
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:44,710
All right. All the way across there. So it's a lot. It's gonna be a lot of grappling.

112
00:23:54,420 --> 00:24:02,730
OK, I want to collect items. I got to go. Headshots only for 10 straight minutes. Start

113
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:16,519
the clock once. Grapple gun. Oh, that's right. OK, cool. That's what her melee is.

114
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:45,990
I probably shouldn't have done that. Can I restart? Please let me just let me restart.

115
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:52,470
I'm restarting because I got hit by the meteor. I got hit by the fucking meteor. Hold on a second.

116
00:24:52,470 --> 00:25:04,440
I got hit by the meteor. Just give me one minute. I got a new setup. I got to get used to. I'm too

117
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:16,809
comfy. I'm getting too comfortable. Maybe I should just not do that. Maybe I just not attack yet.

118
00:25:16,809 --> 00:25:42,170
I can sneak up on people, right? Yeah, don't shoot me, buddy. What am I doing?

119
00:25:42,809 --> 00:25:59,500
Oh, OK. Can I get up there? It'd be this close. Yeah, I looked down to see where she was.

120
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:20,250
Get over it. Oh, give me these bra. Don't. Hey, don't you rob me. I need to look sometimes.

121
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:43,819
It's a new computer just right there. It's got to be some kind of achievement, right?

122
00:26:43,819 --> 00:27:06,809
Kill everybody without enough the alarm. All right. Get away from the meteor. Is it still

123
00:27:06,809 --> 00:27:17,099
falling? How long does it take to land? I want it. This is why I came down here.

124
00:27:17,099 --> 00:27:28,490
Oh, yeah, I'll take the jewels. Very good. Very cool. Very cool. Oh, my God. They're raining

125
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:43,259
hell. They're going to come out of his head. No, we're good. I got to kill the person on the

126
00:27:43,259 --> 00:28:10,309
catapult, right? Oh, didn't hurt me. I'm fine. Stop shooting these at me. Oh, my God. I hate

127
00:28:10,309 --> 00:29:02,069
these things. Oh, cool. Red herb. All right. Where? I need a grapple hook area. You look like

128
00:29:02,069 --> 00:29:42,039
my dad. All right. I can't. Hold on a second. Where's the grapple hook? Am I safe down here?

129
00:29:42,039 --> 00:29:56,039
I don't think so. You look like the owner of this castle. That's actually pretty good.

130
00:29:57,559 --> 00:30:10,440
That was actually very good. That was an 11 out of 10. All right. There goes one.

131
00:30:14,519 --> 00:30:26,900
Shit. Okay. So where can I go from here? There's got to be a grapple hook from here, right?

132
00:30:27,539 --> 00:30:32,630
They wouldn't have emphasized the grapple hook if I couldn't use it a lot more frequently than I am

133
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:42,230
right now. Down to the ground level? You look like Gabby J, 10 years younger. Oh, that's actually

134
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:54,539
awesome. You look like a handyman. All right, keep them coming. These are great. What are these

135
00:30:54,539 --> 00:31:07,769
doing over there, huh? Hey, what? You got a problem with your sink? Hey, give me a call.

136
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:17,740
I'm not going to fix it. I'm going to fuck it up. No more talking. That's about to kill me.

137
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:38,119
Where's the grapple hook? I don't think I can go that way. Can I? They gave me the grapple

138
00:31:38,119 --> 00:31:53,619
hook tutorial and I only used it once. Dude, where's the grapple hook? She's like, oh yeah,

139
00:31:53,619 --> 00:32:04,390
I'll use my grapple hook to get over there. Oh, just kidding. It's in one spot. Oh, wait.

140
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:26,890
You look like the third Mario brother. I like that one too. Okay. What the hell is going on here?

141
00:32:28,819 --> 00:32:40,339
I can't reach from here. Can I reach with this grenade? What the fuck is going on?

142
00:32:40,900 --> 00:33:07,849
Somebody help? Why do I not understand what's going on here? You have to go down? Well,

143
00:33:07,849 --> 00:33:11,289
when I, when I walked over here, it was just unloading these bombs that I couldn't keep

144
00:33:11,289 --> 00:33:23,319
walking and there's no grapple hook. Come on, Jack. Raise the cannon. Oh my God. This is okay.

145
00:33:23,319 --> 00:33:27,559
This is what happens when you don't play a game and a DLC comes out like four months later.

146
00:33:29,339 --> 00:33:40,299
That's right. I forgot that thing existed. All right. How do I open it up? How do I get in there?

147
00:34:04,789 --> 00:34:12,650
Dude, how do I get in this fucking room? Okay. There it is. All right. Now we can start playing.

148
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:18,539
This'll do nicely.

149
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:40,679
Jesus Christ. I thought I was supposed to use the grapple hook and like,

150
00:34:43,699 --> 00:34:47,219
no, shoot him with the cannon. Like in the regular game that you played.

151
00:34:55,510 --> 00:35:44,840
Thanks. All right, let's go. All right. There we go. Now this is what I thought

152
00:35:44,840 --> 00:36:06,099
I was going to be doing. Oh shit. No, I'm not. Oh, that hurt. Actually, you know what?

153
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:23,800
Uh, I have to use this now, don't I? No. Wait, is it red and green does extra health or you have

154
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:46,500
to do all three, right? So I shouldn't use that. Be very careful. How did that miss?

155
00:36:51,510 --> 00:37:00,730
What are these cannonballs? Like tiny little bowling balls? Like candle pin? Yeah, they are.

156
00:37:01,449 --> 00:37:16,739
All right, cool. Okay. There's one more up here. Yeah, there we go. All right. I really need to

157
00:37:16,739 --> 00:37:32,199
find other health. I think there's one right here. I have to. I don't want to, but I'm going to.

158
00:37:33,559 --> 00:37:58,659
Nothing personal. I just scared the shit out of somebody. All right. Did I miss anything up here?

159
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:23,659
How do you look like that? You look like you hate Sonic. I think I need to be a little fatter for

160
00:38:23,659 --> 00:38:39,219
that one. Oh, but hold on. Do I be Dr. Robotnik for Halloween or do I stay with Count Dracula?

161
00:38:40,019 --> 00:38:56,119
That's very hard now that you said that. I don't know. Do both. I don't think I can do both.

162
00:38:56,760 --> 00:39:01,449
Cutscene.

163
00:39:24,309 --> 00:39:33,099
You look old and pale in the new angle. I am old and pale. Sorry to ruin the surprise for you.

164
00:39:56,059 --> 00:39:56,780
Separate ways.

165
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:28,039
Chapter two already? That was a whole chapter.

166
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:40,039
Okay, so what is that? Let me go. I got a scope, didn't I? What is this? That's a knife.

167
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:59,460
Uh, sorry about that. Okay. There we go. He's in an executive chair. Right. I don't know why an

168
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:04,019
executive is cracking his neck as in like, yeah, bring it on. I don't know what that was for.

169
00:41:04,659 --> 00:41:17,849
All right. Let's, uh, anything else on the map is that, which is cool. Okay. I might brown out

170
00:41:17,849 --> 00:41:22,789
my computer. I just want to make sure everyone's aware. Hey, I got a lot of testing to do if it

171
00:41:22,789 --> 00:41:29,219
happens, but, uh, I, it could happen. It might happen right now. Uh, just to, uh, if I, if it

172
00:41:29,219 --> 00:41:38,010
happens right now, then I will know exactly what's going on. So, uh, everyone say prayers.

173
00:41:38,570 --> 00:42:05,269
I'm going to go down. Can I jump down? No, not yet. He saw me.

174
00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:50,409
I got him. Well, this is going to be a chainsaw person down there. It's gonna be a chainsaw,

175
00:42:50,409 --> 00:43:07,050
dude. I bet you there's a chainsaw person down there. Only handgun for a while. You look like

176
00:43:07,050 --> 00:43:12,780
you own this castle. Uh, I, I want to write that one's going down in the notebook.

177
00:43:31,849 --> 00:43:40,840
All right. Old man sounds. I probably shouldn't blow that up. I thought I was going to stand up

178
00:43:40,840 --> 00:44:05,530
into it. Uh, how shitty is this set up? I have a lot of bullets. I think I got everything. Yeah.

179
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:25,559
I feel like I'm at an open mic night where one dude won't get off the stage. You go to open

180
00:44:25,559 --> 00:44:30,780
mic night and the guy has an entire streaming set up on the stage and he's just playing

181
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:37,289
resident evil four to the audience. That actually is kind of funny. I, if somebody does that, I want

182
00:44:37,289 --> 00:44:43,780
a 5% credit for it. Somebody should go like do a comedy night, right? Well, you have to get,

183
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:49,610
make sure you get permission first and be like, yeah, it's my routine. It's me. Uh, bill. Uh,

184
00:44:49,610 --> 00:44:56,679
I am, uh, bill comedy. And Hey, let me talk about airplanes for a second and then stop talking and

185
00:44:56,679 --> 00:45:00,280
just bring out an entire streaming set up and just played resident evil with a monitor facing

186
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:08,570
the audience. Looking back every so often, like, Whoa, did you see that? You're going to get booed

187
00:45:08,570 --> 00:45:34,199
off stage as you deserve. Okay. Well, I got it. Don't reload at a time like this. You missed your

188
00:45:34,199 --> 00:46:08,650
opportunity out of all the times to reload. Why that time? Jesus. Did I get hit by that? Oh my

189
00:46:08,650 --> 00:46:15,750
God. I forgot about those. If they have the heads like this, that means they're like 10 times

190
00:46:15,750 --> 00:46:39,269
stronger. Okay. Well I fucked that whole thing up by like running and like, I'm not that far. I'm

191
00:46:39,269 --> 00:46:59,639
right here. You look like somebody that calls himself a man of culture. Yeah. I have to have

192
00:46:59,639 --> 00:47:08,059
a craft beer here. I actually thought about it. I thought I was going to have a craft beer and just,

193
00:47:08,059 --> 00:47:16,309
I was going to take a sip out of it every hour. Oh my God. Play the game. How did that hit me?

194
00:47:16,309 --> 00:47:33,139
I'm looking down. Oh shit. My hand, my hand is a little sweaty. Hold on. My hand is sweaty.

195
00:47:34,019 --> 00:48:01,239
Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. He's dead. All right. I should be fine now.

196
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:26,820
I don't want to take this shit right now. I have to, that stinks. How do I do the grapple hook

197
00:48:26,820 --> 00:49:17,369
thing again? It's shipped, right? How do you do the grapple hook mailer? Yellow. All right. That

198
00:49:17,369 --> 00:49:36,780
went a little better. A little. Can we just get one katana pick? Like I have, like I own a katana.

199
00:49:36,780 --> 00:49:51,590
You want a katana? I don't, I don't, I don't own a katana. Do all goofy men in their late thirties

200
00:49:51,590 --> 00:50:15,019
own katanas? Am I behind on this? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, they do. All right. Where am I going?

201
00:50:33,159 --> 00:50:55,510
I think I got everything. I got most, wait, what's that over there? You do the grapple,

202
00:50:55,510 --> 00:51:11,159
you just need to hit the melee key from far away. Interesting. Put a fedora,

203
00:51:11,159 --> 00:51:24,340
put a fedora on right now. I'm seeing quite the crowd here. I wonder what has them so riled up.

204
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:37,510
President's daughter. Couldn't have picked a worse time. Consider the village infected

205
00:51:37,510 --> 00:51:45,900
saturation. I've read the file. I'll see what I can do. Turn on hand cam. Uh, I don't have one of

206
00:51:45,900 --> 00:52:17,400
those. I'm not missing anything right now. Don't the treasure show up on the map? Oh,

207
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:36,780
wait, you guys gas lit the hell out of me last time I played this. That's not accurate. Uh,

208
00:52:36,780 --> 00:52:46,760
let me sort this. I can craft right now. All right. What, what should I do? Should I just

209
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:53,340
get submachine gun ammo? I'll toss the monitor. Well, it's not going to be like this in the very

210
00:52:53,340 --> 00:52:59,929
near future. I actually don't mind this angle though. I think it looks pretty fine, but this,

211
00:52:59,929 --> 00:53:05,159
this wall back here, it's going to be a little bit, uh, I'll be a little bit closer. No,

212
00:53:05,159 --> 00:53:07,639
it depends on how I do it, but I'll probably be closer to the wall.

213
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:38,360
And then this will be a little bit further away. I like the new setup. Well, it just,

214
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:46,280
it allows me to sit back. It's much more comfortable. I, I'll be really honest. Last,

215
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:52,920
I don't want to say the last couple of years, sitting up at a desk has just been, it's just,

216
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:58,809
it's just caused me so many issues. I don't want to get into it. I know it's a broken record at

217
00:53:58,809 --> 00:54:04,570
this point talking about it, but being able to actually sit back changes everything for me.

218
00:54:05,289 --> 00:54:22,980
I might be able to stealth kill like all these people. Yeah. I thought of, you know,

219
00:54:22,980 --> 00:54:26,179
get a standing desk, but standing is not, doesn't, it's not great either.

220
00:54:28,570 --> 00:54:33,989
This position I'm in right now is just the perfect position for me to do anything. Seated,

221
00:54:34,869 --> 00:54:40,309
not really slouched, but have the support of my back at the upper chest area. Something about

222
00:54:40,309 --> 00:54:50,469
sitting in a chair like this. Much better. I'm much happier. Not that I was miserable before,

223
00:54:50,469 --> 00:55:05,190
but you all know, I don't have to get into it. I want to go upstairs. Wait, no, no, no. Check

224
00:55:05,190 --> 00:55:37,820
every corner. I feel like there's probably something down there, but hold on. No, I was

225
00:55:37,820 --> 00:55:41,980
already up there. All right, let's go. I always feel like I'm going to miss something in these

226
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:52,329
games and I always do. I'm going to get surrounded, right? That's how it works.

227
00:55:58,199 --> 00:56:31,989
See you. Is that person still alive? Get off me. We're good. We're not good.

228
00:56:32,550 --> 00:56:49,769
Stop exploding old people. You tried Baldur's Gate 3? Yeah, Holly and I actually played it for

229
00:56:49,769 --> 00:56:55,449
a little bit, but I got a little distracted with other stuff, but I do want to get back into it.

230
00:56:56,329 --> 00:57:11,380
We did the first maybe five to 10 hours. Nothing, anything past that. Can't I, hold on a second.

231
00:57:14,739 --> 00:57:30,170
I need the two ovals, not, or rectangles, not the ovals. Try Voices of the Void. That game

232
00:57:30,170 --> 00:57:45,300
is perfect for you. I'll try it. She has her trust over there. Oh my God. He said, he said it

233
00:57:45,300 --> 00:58:05,909
funny. I did. I did say it funny. You're too self-aware. I have to be. I, sometimes I can't

234
00:58:05,909 --> 00:58:28,789
even put up with my own bullshit. It's, you know what I mean? I have to be. Nice. Okay.

235
00:58:29,940 --> 00:58:40,340
What's the goal here? Just to go down here. Okay. You forgot to clean the chocolate milk mustache

236
00:58:40,340 --> 00:58:47,050
off. I can't, my, my, anytime I try to do something like this, it's just disgusting,

237
00:58:54,980 --> 00:59:16,699
but I'm doing it. I'm doing it. I'm doing it. How much did this VTuber avatar cost?

238
00:59:28,219 --> 01:00:16,469
What the fuck? He knows how to speak Resident Evil. Okay. Am I missing something? Nope.

239
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:42,340
Not surprised. So kind of you to keep our friends busy.

240
01:00:43,300 --> 01:01:01,590
He's such a dickhead. This way looks promising. I'm not even looking. I'm not even looking. I

241
01:01:01,590 --> 01:01:25,909
missed. Shit. I love this engine. It's, you know, I know, I know I'm the fuck Capcom guy.

242
01:01:26,710 --> 01:01:33,699
I know that, but I think they actually might be, as of right now, probably one of the better

243
01:01:33,699 --> 01:01:38,090
game company that exists right now. I think they've had, they've had like five bangers in a

244
01:01:38,090 --> 01:01:42,329
row. And I can't, like, I can't deny that. It's like, I think that they've been doing,

245
01:01:42,329 --> 01:01:58,090
they're doing a wonderful job, a wonderful job, but that was just, that was just anger coming out.

246
01:01:58,090 --> 01:02:03,940
I didn't actually mean that I was mad because I couldn't change the FOV and I got very upset

247
01:02:03,940 --> 01:02:25,340
about it. Like irrationally upset. There was no reason to be that mad about it. This is going to

248
01:02:25,340 --> 01:03:14,389
fall. I think that's what happens when you play on standard mode. Oh, just in time, bros. Top

249
01:03:14,389 --> 01:03:29,829
shit at the bottom. They both have little, uh, circles on them. Okay. I have to use the mouse

250
01:03:29,829 --> 01:03:43,460
scroll. That's it, right? Now that I think, all right. Where's the other one? The two birds.

251
01:03:43,460 --> 01:04:06,599
Is it that one? It's like the opposite to kind of either this one or this one. I'm pretty sure

252
01:04:06,599 --> 01:04:21,639
it's that one. All right. Well we need the third one. I can't do it without the third one. Where's

253
01:04:21,639 --> 01:04:44,150
this painted down there? Oh, he's going to get up. He's going to get up. He's going to get up.

254
01:04:44,150 --> 01:05:03,380
He's going to get up. He figured it out. Wait, what's this? Oh, it's one of those. Get all the

255
01:05:03,380 --> 01:05:10,070
blue things. Six spinals. All right. So are they listed? They are. So this one's right behind me.

256
01:05:10,070 --> 01:05:37,139
Or is it? Oh, there it is. I see it. Did I see it? I think I did. Where are the other ones? Okay.

257
01:05:37,780 --> 01:05:54,219
Uh, what is it? It is. It's the, I need to get this guy out of the way. How do I move this guy?

258
01:05:54,219 --> 01:06:03,699
I think it's the two. How do I move this guy? I think I know which one it is. It's the double.

259
01:06:07,849 --> 01:06:22,139
It's the two, one, two, and then I'll figure it out. Skip VOD watchers. Skip. No VOD watchers.

260
01:06:22,139 --> 01:06:27,289
Stay here. Don't leave. Unless you've got something to do. You might have an appointment.

261
01:06:27,289 --> 01:06:30,329
You have like other stuff going on. Maybe your friend's coming over. Maybe like school you got

262
01:06:30,329 --> 01:06:35,289
to go to. Maybe you've got, um, like food to eat or something. Don't go. Unless any of those things

263
01:06:35,289 --> 01:06:38,409
are happening. Maybe you'd like playing a game on your own. Maybe you don't feel like watching

264
01:06:38,409 --> 01:06:50,250
TV or streaming today. That's fine. But any other scenario, don't go. Which one is it?

265
01:06:50,809 --> 01:07:14,010
Is it this one? No. It's like a double bump. Is it this right here? Was it that? It had like two

266
01:07:14,889 --> 01:07:29,300
bumps. Fucking one of these. One, two, but I, the guy is in the way. It's not my fault.

267
01:07:30,179 --> 01:07:53,699
Does he despawn? Get the fuck out of, I don't care. It's worth it. What is on the right here?

268
01:07:53,699 --> 01:08:08,039
That's what I need. Is it? Okay. One, two, wait. Okay. One, two, three. He's only covering 5%

269
01:08:08,039 --> 01:08:14,260
of the design. Yeah, but it's important to know it. I think it's the one, it's one, two, three.

270
01:08:14,260 --> 01:08:18,979
There's a third one right there. He's just in the way. It's one, two, three. It's three of those,

271
01:08:18,979 --> 01:08:43,720
uh, squiggly swirlies, whatever they are. Right? I'm pretty sure this is it. There's only like two

272
01:08:43,720 --> 01:08:47,859
options. Well, I want to do the puzzle. I don't want to just, I didn't want it to be handed to

273
01:08:47,859 --> 01:08:56,649
me by a chat member saying that one third one from the left. That's not me. I don't think I

274
01:08:56,649 --> 01:09:11,340
need to deal yet. Blue medallions. I'd want it to run that way. I didn't the church. I literally

275
01:09:11,340 --> 01:09:27,220
turned around. I literally turned around. Oh God damn it, man. Well, can I go back? I doubt it.

276
01:09:27,220 --> 01:09:59,319
Some shit over here though. I might actually have to restart. Hey, Red Dead Redemption figured this

277
01:09:59,319 --> 01:10:08,439
out a long time ago. Old shift for two seconds to grab a hook. Tap shift is in a tap shift.

278
01:10:08,520 --> 01:10:12,199
That doesn't work. Hold shift is run. Whatever. I don't know how to figure this shit. I don't know

279
01:10:12,199 --> 01:10:32,420
how to fix this. I really want those that wins. Where's the auto save right now? Well, it looks

280
01:10:32,420 --> 01:11:29,210
like we're not getting those spinals 10 seconds ago. Hey, that kind of whatever. It's okay. Hey,

281
01:11:29,210 --> 01:11:45,539
we don't even need them. I don't want to miss the shit here though. I'm upset about that. I'm upset.

282
01:11:46,020 --> 01:12:07,029
What do I do about this? Restart the whole DLC? No, I'm sorry. People are so mean to you.

283
01:12:07,670 --> 01:12:39,510
They don't, they don't mean it. Sorry. I do. Well, you know what? Give a shit. I give a fuck.

284
01:12:39,510 --> 01:13:31,989
Let's fuck up. Cut scene. Minus one. I know the vision, but the sounds weren't set. We're sad.

285
01:13:32,550 --> 01:13:41,130
I like how I got a half point on that. Well, no, actually it's a half negative point. Hey,

286
01:13:41,130 --> 01:13:53,159
I know the vision was there. The vision was there. I feel like I just auditioned for American

287
01:13:53,159 --> 01:13:59,140
Idol and I was not very good, but you didn't want to tell me I wasn't good because you didn't want

288
01:13:59,140 --> 01:14:27,260
me to like scream at you. Hey, what's that line? Where's everybody going? Bingo. Wait,

289
01:14:27,260 --> 01:14:36,630
why is he dressed like this? Why is he dressed like that? Why is he dressed like that? That

290
01:14:36,630 --> 01:14:44,619
didn't happen in my game. First time's free. Why does he look like that? Don't keep me waiting,

291
01:14:44,619 --> 01:14:52,220
Luis. I didn't even know that was Leon. We're supposed to know that that's like a,

292
01:14:52,220 --> 01:14:56,220
wow, this is that part that everybody thinks is funny and cool. I thought that was a different

293
01:14:56,220 --> 01:15:15,850
character. Sir Mendez, isn't it? He has a house there. Could be worth taking a look.

294
01:15:15,850 --> 01:15:27,109
Do it. I'll see what I can do it. Sorry. I just hear that and I just have to do trouble.

295
01:15:27,189 --> 01:15:36,460
No stream while sitting on a camel next time, bro. Some of you guys need to fucking relax.

296
01:15:43,079 --> 01:16:11,020
Okay. This thing is fucking filthy. Where do I go? So where, uh,

297
01:16:14,090 --> 01:16:35,500
where do I go? It's locked. It's not locked. What if Ashley,

298
01:16:35,500 --> 01:16:53,130
they're locked in the church to leave point good time. Trevor from GTA. Any other stuff in here?

299
01:16:58,500 --> 01:17:10,260
He does. He does. That one was real. Uh, was it, is this a treasure map?

300
01:17:10,260 --> 01:18:04,729
Somebody write that down real quick. Bird. What's up? Wait, can I break through? I can

301
01:18:04,729 --> 01:18:20,020
definitely get through that glass. Yeah. Be kidding me. I can't shoot up there. Why not?

302
01:18:20,020 --> 01:18:42,600
His bar is there. Well, did I miss something in that door or around the side? I would imagine

303
01:18:42,600 --> 01:18:53,430
I could have grappled hooked up to the top there, but I guess not. Once we go back, wait,

304
01:18:57,460 --> 01:19:10,250
can't get up there. Why don't we do that? I've asked this question before and I've

305
01:19:10,250 --> 01:19:14,810
never gotten an answer. How come anytime you ever looked down or anytime you rub your eye,

306
01:19:14,810 --> 01:19:30,180
everybody goes, what is the reflex in your brain that does that? Damn it. Oh, I was going to get

307
01:19:30,180 --> 01:20:00,279
a lot of people to think I was cool. Glasses. Somebody has a bomb view. I'm trying to do the

308
01:20:00,279 --> 01:20:07,939
melee when they're far away, but it's not, um, it's not doing it. Do I have to be really far

309
01:20:07,939 --> 01:20:36,859
away? Somebody has a grenade. I can hear it. All right. So I need to go that way. Is it,

310
01:20:36,859 --> 01:20:49,989
is the thing in one of the gravestones? It probably is, right? It's definitely, it's like

311
01:20:49,989 --> 01:21:35,939
in or on the back yet over here somewhere. The worst place to put that. Okay. I don't see it

312
01:21:35,939 --> 01:21:58,010
over here. I just have to backtrack this whole way. I do. I did. Thank you. Stranger. So what

313
01:21:58,010 --> 01:22:08,180
are you buying? You've picked quite the place to set up shop stranger. I, and look what it brought.

314
01:22:08,180 --> 01:22:29,449
That scared the shit out of me. Let's make our first time doing business. All right. I got money

315
01:22:29,529 --> 01:22:36,489
and I, I do have that case customized shit. Don't I? I don't have any, um, key chains for it though.

316
01:22:37,210 --> 01:22:52,420
Got something new for you. I trade it. Wait, let me, let me load these up first.

317
01:22:58,460 --> 01:23:10,810
Blue. Uh, I could do one in one. That'd be good. Or should I wait? Is two better? Should I do two

318
01:23:10,810 --> 01:23:21,060
red? I kind of don't, I don't want to lose all of them though. Two is better. Double is more.

319
01:23:21,699 --> 01:23:39,859
How much more? 12,000. Yeah, let's do it. Oh, this is just for selling.

320
01:23:41,220 --> 01:23:57,289
Well, killing me. Oh wait. Trade. Oh, you can trade for a spinals. Okay. That's interesting.

321
01:23:57,289 --> 01:24:04,779
Got a itchy neck. Ruby's all rubbish. She makes no difference. The price. Well,

322
01:24:05,500 --> 01:24:09,500
that's our choice. I don't need these glasses. Like Wesker doesn't get pissed off or something

323
01:24:09,500 --> 01:24:14,010
like those are my glasses. You found them. Why did you not give them back to me? I don't think so.

324
01:24:17,619 --> 01:24:26,020
Thank you. Anything else I can help you with? All right. Important. You'll get some bang for

325
01:24:26,020 --> 01:24:40,840
your buck. I guarantee it. Sawed off. W870. First aid spray. I want the case upgraded.

326
01:24:41,479 --> 01:24:49,960
All yours stranger. Plus 15% submachine gun ammo craft bonus frequency. I mean, why not, right?

327
01:24:54,100 --> 01:25:06,090
Stranger. Should I get this or am I going to find a better submachine gun in like 20 minutes?

328
01:25:10,460 --> 01:25:24,279
Get it? Stranger. I'm going to get a first aid spray because I suck at video games and I need

329
01:25:24,279 --> 01:25:30,470
to make sure I have it in case I need it. You know, I'll just buy these. I don't always have

330
01:25:30,470 --> 01:25:41,819
this in stock. Stranger. Punisher. That's, is that accuracy or is that, no, is that firepower

331
01:25:41,819 --> 01:25:52,090
accuracy? Precision. Why not try your hand at a new gun stranger? I'm going to keep it. All right.

332
01:25:52,090 --> 01:25:59,300
Tune up. Power. I think we're going to go power. Molding a weapon. We're starting to get an idea

333
01:25:59,300 --> 01:26:04,170
of your tastes friend. I never used the submachine gun. I might as well this time.

334
01:26:04,970 --> 01:26:19,449
Prepare the knife. Your valuables won't do you much good in the grave. I feel like I'm not going

335
01:26:19,449 --> 01:26:24,310
to use this that frequently. I'd rather just not have this. It takes a lot of space.

336
01:26:33,319 --> 01:26:47,779
What do I have here? Hold on. I need to make some stuff. Okay. I could make a ton of submachine

337
01:26:47,779 --> 01:27:01,130
gun ammo. I can make rifle ammo too. Or handgun ammo. Yeah. Let's go submachine gun. Ooh, nice.

338
01:27:01,130 --> 01:27:19,180
Okay. I'm going to hold off now. A lot of ammo. I got two heals. I'll be fine. You hate the

339
01:27:19,180 --> 01:27:25,100
shotgun? Well, I mean, the last time I played this, I did 50 round shotgun and just unloaded

340
01:27:25,100 --> 01:27:30,520
on the last boss and beat the game in 10 seconds. I didn't even have this equipped. Oh my God. I'm

341
01:27:30,520 --> 01:27:46,630
such a dope. I don't know why I thought it was on automatically for some reason. Okay. Let's go.

342
01:27:47,350 --> 01:27:58,119
So far, this is fun. I like it. Just more of a residue before. All right. This thing is ready

343
01:27:58,119 --> 01:28:13,239
to go. So what's next? Into the village square. Should I make the rifle ammo and just have it?

344
01:28:13,239 --> 01:28:29,510
I feel like maybe I will need it. I'll think about it. Let's go. I don't have enough money

345
01:28:29,510 --> 01:28:38,569
to repair the knife, so we aren't going to do that. Get some thoughts. Unusual. Yeah. Yeah.

346
01:28:39,210 --> 01:28:58,119
I said beast. Uh-huh. That thing is coming. Okay. Master, I beg you. All right. Okay. Boom. Oh,

347
01:28:58,119 --> 01:29:02,199
I got to start doing 1080p streaming as well. I'm thinking about how I'm going to do that.

348
01:29:03,479 --> 01:29:08,439
Maybe I just won't. 864p all the way. All right. I thought that was Darth Vader when I came over

349
01:29:08,439 --> 01:29:24,439
here. Like right now, that was Darth Vader. Saddler, the leader of the cult. Make the switch

350
01:29:24,439 --> 01:29:35,479
right now. We'll see. If anything, I probably would. What's the bitrate I stream at right now?

351
01:29:36,039 --> 01:29:40,789
I'm pretty sure I'm at the maximum allowed bitrate for Twitch, but I'm going to look into

352
01:29:40,789 --> 01:29:45,109
that again because I might be able to increase it by like 500 to a thousand, which might just

353
01:29:45,109 --> 01:30:00,420
fix everything. Not that the stream looks terrible, but eh. Let's see. Make the rifle ammo.

354
01:30:00,420 --> 01:30:33,399
I don't have one of these burritos. All right. This is definitely the actual fight.

355
01:30:40,729 --> 01:30:49,689
Okay. What do we got? Parry. You have a knife? Oh, that's why they were saying you should repair

356
01:30:49,689 --> 01:30:55,289
the knife. Jerma. Jerma, can you hear us? Jerma, please. You need to repair the knife. Oh, I see

357
01:30:55,289 --> 01:31:16,199
now. I think I just did it though. You tell me to parry and then you tell me to press C on the

358
01:31:16,199 --> 01:32:07,289
keyboard. Come on, Gwen. Where are you? Oh, shit. Tried to parry it. Does that mean it's locked?

359
01:32:09,960 --> 01:32:52,579
Yes. God damn it. Not again. Oh, I got it. This is the real one. Oh, shit. No. I don't need to do

360
01:32:52,579 --> 01:34:35,979
that yet. He's fake. It's getting thicker. You idiot. Mog-like. Kind of. Chief's house.

361
01:34:35,979 --> 01:34:53,239
Thought I'd left that life behind. Are you reclined? My legs are not up. Hey, in the future,

362
01:34:53,239 --> 01:35:02,010
might be an opportunity where I would be in. Legs might be up. All right. Let me just make sure I

363
01:35:02,010 --> 01:35:20,119
get everything here. Let me replace all the stuff I just shot. Sausages? Corn. There are sausages

364
01:35:20,119 --> 01:36:12,600
right behind it, guys. Glass. Anything else? Yes. Okay, so that was this house. You know,

365
01:36:12,600 --> 01:36:18,539
I'm checking every single one of these, right? And we shouldn't. Every single one of these.

366
01:36:26,229 --> 01:37:29,239
Shotgun. Boogers. Oh, Leon took it. Continuity. That it? Maybe. It's a quick rocking break.

367
01:37:29,239 --> 01:37:45,369
What is the green smudge behind you? It's making me want to. Hey, will you settle down?

368
01:37:45,369 --> 01:38:07,720
It's the whole Pac-Man crew. Settle down. Keep them. Oh, trust me. I will keep them.

369
01:38:07,720 --> 01:38:12,539
I just want to put them there because it was fun. And I have a streamer room now.

370
01:38:12,539 --> 01:38:17,640
All right. I could have. That's this one. There's one more. Two more houses I want to look at.

371
01:38:26,579 --> 01:38:53,619
Anything else? I don't think so. Oh, egg. Nice. There is an Omega chest in here.

372
01:38:53,619 --> 01:39:22,100
Oh, that's this one. This one. There's one. What? Two more houses? One, two. And over here.

373
01:39:22,659 --> 01:39:40,250
That's it. Did I get the item I was supposed to get? No. Yeah, I don't think I did. I have to go

374
01:39:47,000 --> 01:40:15,989
village chiefs. Now, did I get that item? I didn't. So what do I get that? Yeah, maybe up there.

375
01:40:15,989 --> 01:40:35,930
Oh, no, it's broken. Oh, shit. I can go in here. Wait. Don't think I'm stupid. Don't think I'm

376
01:40:35,930 --> 01:40:42,470
stupid. Don't think I don't think I'm stupid. Please don't think I'm stupid. I have a reason

377
01:40:42,470 --> 01:40:58,460
for it. OK, but in actuality, though, I don't have the thing to put into the church thing.

378
01:40:58,460 --> 01:41:34,060
It's some aviators. I just go all the way back. I didn't really accomplish much besides.

379
01:41:34,060 --> 01:41:42,069
Yeah, sure. No, I know. I mean, I need that circular thing. I thought I was going to get

380
01:41:42,069 --> 01:41:51,960
it from that little boss fight, but I didn't get it. Are you pretending? No. Every time there's a

381
01:41:51,960 --> 01:41:57,659
cut scene, I go like this and just just watch what you guys say for five minutes. And then I turn back

382
01:41:57,659 --> 01:42:04,789
when the cut scenes over and then the cut scene ends. And she has said the next step of the video

383
01:42:04,789 --> 01:42:12,229
game. And I've been just like hanging out over here. It's like just like just chatting. You

384
01:42:12,390 --> 01:42:21,350
you guys are the cut scene for me. That's so funny to think about. Not every time,

385
01:42:21,350 --> 01:42:27,029
but a lot of time. It kind of works out that way. Name every bug. Beetle. Spider. Arachnid.

386
01:42:31,289 --> 01:43:25,770
Selpigid. Scorpion. Wasp. Bee. Weevil. Death feigning beetle. Ant. Butterfly. Earwig.

387
01:43:26,329 --> 01:43:35,979
Okay. Who cares? Oh, is it a cut scene? No, I'm paying attention now.

388
01:43:35,979 --> 01:44:23,779
Has accepted the gift. The straw's not long enough. That's what she was during that cut scene.

389
01:44:23,779 --> 01:44:57,020
Ada saves him. Ada saves him. It's pretty cool. That's my favorite chapter, I think.

390
01:45:00,869 --> 01:45:05,510
Anybody else do that? I hate that I do it, but I do it. It's so obvious, but you do it anyways.

391
01:45:06,229 --> 01:45:10,420
Something's on TV or a movie or a show or a game. Doesn't matter what it is.

392
01:45:11,140 --> 01:45:15,819
And you know what characters on screen and you fall asleep for like five straight minutes.

393
01:45:17,819 --> 01:45:20,619
And when you know that everyone else is awake and you're not,

394
01:45:21,350 --> 01:45:24,390
you kind of wake up and just say the character's name. And then the thing that they were just

395
01:45:24,390 --> 01:45:29,670
doing, like, oh yeah, I was watching like Ada on the roof. Yep. Ada up on the roof.

396
01:45:32,699 --> 01:45:38,149
That was good. That was good. It was a good chapter. Pretty cool. What's, yeah,

397
01:45:38,149 --> 01:45:41,909
that's like probably like the best part of the game, I think. And you were sleeping for five,

398
01:45:41,909 --> 01:45:48,039
10 straight minutes. It's like, everybody knows you have no idea what just happened.

399
01:45:48,680 --> 01:45:52,680
And it sucks so bad when that person is then like, yeah, dude. Oh,

400
01:45:52,680 --> 01:45:57,319
the part right before that too. Like, remember that? It's like, oh shit. I'm getting quizzed.

401
01:45:58,279 --> 01:46:08,789
Yeah. Oh, and then you make up shit that you started a new conversation. You say like,

402
01:46:09,350 --> 01:46:14,229
oh yeah. Hey, did you upgrade? Did you upgrade that gun? Did you, that when you upgraded that

403
01:46:14,229 --> 01:46:18,710
gun, are you going to continue to upgrade the machine gun? Then you get them talking

404
01:46:18,710 --> 01:46:21,909
and make sure that they continue to kind of lead the conversation to a new area.

405
01:46:29,350 --> 01:46:47,159
What a first world problem. I'll say that's social poker. No, that's, I don't want the

406
01:46:47,159 --> 01:46:54,949
person to think that I don't care or I'm not paying attention or I'd be like, keep them busy.

407
01:46:59,239 --> 01:47:08,439
That outfit, that outfit is so funny. I wasn't sleeping. You, you pick things that, you know,

408
01:47:08,439 --> 01:47:29,289
you can ask an answer to. My sleepy dad does that a lot. I don't have a key. Okay. I need a key.

409
01:47:29,850 --> 01:47:44,649
It's 3am in Europe. Why are you always alive at the worst times? Well, here's you and here am I.

410
01:47:47,020 --> 01:47:58,810
There's 7 million miles between us. Sorry. Sorry. I'm really sorry. It's just the way it is.

411
01:48:07,560 --> 01:48:12,489
You said I have jowls? Who just said I had jowls? Ban that person for real. Like,

412
01:48:12,489 --> 01:48:23,060
don't let them ever come back. No, I don't. Whatever. Did anybody actually say that? I

413
01:48:23,060 --> 01:48:46,520
actually need to know. What did they actually say? And at least their holy book looks interesting.

414
01:48:46,520 --> 01:48:59,909
Jowls detected. Reload all these guns. None of us are thinking about your jowls.

415
01:48:59,909 --> 01:49:20,020
They got permabanned. Let that be a lesson. Oh, you little shits. This could use some cleaning.

416
01:49:20,020 --> 01:49:44,869
I can't leave empty handed. Oh, grandpa's coming out. Ooh, an extravagant clock.

417
01:49:45,430 --> 01:49:52,489
Oh no, the recliner era. Yeah. I was going to have a cigar over here and have like a little,

418
01:49:52,489 --> 01:49:57,130
like a lighter, just like take a break and be like, I'll be right back. Put it in and like,

419
01:49:58,180 --> 01:50:02,600
just walk off camera. Maybe I still will. Just pretend you didn't see it. Pretend we didn't

420
01:50:02,600 --> 01:50:25,140
talk about it. Okay. So cool. Very cool. Wait, check every single corner. Yeah, that's why.

421
01:50:26,100 --> 01:50:44,300
What have we here? Wait, there was a, there was a bureau that a key could go into.

422
01:50:45,930 --> 01:51:07,140
Back here. There was a key. There was a keyhole. Look at that. I think if I put that key

423
01:51:07,939 --> 01:51:48,180
into the keyhole, I might be, where is that room? Is he cooking? Fellas. Fellas. There's a keyhole.

424
01:51:48,180 --> 01:52:04,039
Holy. Okay. Whoa. This is probably important. Brothers and sisters. Our Lord is displeased.

425
01:52:04,359 --> 01:52:09,699
Do not recklessly slay outsiders at will. All people have a right to fair. Has anybody else

426
01:52:09,699 --> 01:52:16,739
found this? Henceforth, we shall deliver solemn justice without prejudice. Take any

427
01:52:16,739 --> 01:52:26,220
when you capture the factory basement. Do the same with the traders. I bet they took him.

428
01:52:26,220 --> 01:52:32,069
I think you might be the first. I feel like, I mean, that's, who would be able to put that

429
01:52:32,069 --> 01:52:39,619
together? It's like kind of hard. Most people just would give up, I think. Okay. So now I got

430
01:52:39,619 --> 01:53:00,359
to go down here. Sounds good. Let's go. Can I like run out now? Chest? No. Is this a fight?

431
01:53:06,890 --> 01:53:29,430
Whoa. I, what happened to him? No. What? There's, there's going to be jewels and stuff back there.

432
01:53:29,430 --> 01:53:38,409
I can't, whatever. You cannot be serious. There's no way you got a hold of me. That was just,

433
01:53:38,409 --> 01:54:20,899
this lady was magnetized to my body. Can you, I wonder if you can kill him. No, you can't. Leon

434
01:54:20,899 --> 01:54:27,130
kills him in like four hours from now. What am I talking about? Is there stuff in here? Who cares?

435
01:54:28,569 --> 01:54:59,000
Ah! Grapple. Grapple it. Grapple. Just kill me. Kill me. That, no, this doesn't count.

436
01:55:09,770 --> 01:55:18,140
I wouldn't have taken that much damage. Just let me restart. Everybody just settle down.

437
01:55:18,140 --> 01:55:22,939
I bet they took him here. He's playing on standard. He's unbelievable. Ah, shut up.

438
01:55:27,340 --> 01:55:49,029
Shut up. Grandpa skill issue. Yeah. All right. I'm not, I turn around and run. All of these escape

439
01:55:49,829 --> 01:55:54,229
the guy. I always just take it so not seriously. And it's, you have to take it dead seriously.

440
01:56:10,949 --> 01:56:25,369
She does not sound concerned at all. Looks like I gave them the slip.

441
01:56:26,010 --> 01:56:37,670
He's too cool for this. Yeah. Have some new goods that might interest you.

442
01:56:37,670 --> 01:56:43,140
If you turned around and started Fortnite dancing to that guy, do you think he would stop?

443
01:56:43,140 --> 01:56:57,770
Do you think he'd be like, Oh, or if you like held your hand out, like, I think he'd be like,

444
01:56:57,770 --> 01:57:00,729
Oh, wait a minute. What does that mean? What does that mean? Why are you doing that?

445
01:57:01,289 --> 01:57:15,180
I feel like you would actually stop. Did I get, I haven't gotten any of these.

446
01:57:20,180 --> 01:57:30,250
Minus two. Don't let them get to you. It's all right.

447
01:57:37,609 --> 01:58:01,210
I can put a blue in here. 10,000. I haven't found any of these. I've just not been looking

448
01:58:01,289 --> 01:58:15,560
or have I not found any? I can sell this, right? Yeah. That means I can sell it. I forget.

449
01:58:16,710 --> 01:58:25,960
Don't play this game. I don't like it. I like it.

450
01:58:26,680 --> 01:58:53,720
8% running speed. That's like, that's hacking a hundred thousand dollars. Okay. Nevermind.

451
01:58:53,720 --> 01:58:55,960
Give that the care it deserves, mate.

452
01:58:58,420 --> 01:59:06,520
And probably ammo capacity. Try that on for size. I've been using the knife a lot.

453
01:59:13,590 --> 01:59:40,890
What can I do you for? Okay. That's a bird. Okay. Now I need to, some grubby thief has stolen

454
01:59:40,890 --> 01:59:45,609
a jacket. One of those nice sheepskin leather ones. I think you can get it back. I think I saw

455
01:59:45,609 --> 01:59:59,189
this. No, I didn't. It's inside here. Does this massage your back? No, that'd be really funny

456
01:59:59,189 --> 02:00:25,399
if it did though. Let me do a little bit of moving around here. Okay. So I have these. Yes.

457
02:00:26,550 --> 02:00:41,510
Nice. You need a sharper image chair. I have not heard that in a long time. I'm going to eat the

458
02:00:41,510 --> 02:00:56,310
egg. All right, let's go. Why is the chair blurry? Like a felt material, like a upholstered.

459
02:01:01,739 --> 02:01:08,729
Interactive retinal inquiry system. The iris will allow you to see clues that are almost

460
02:01:08,729 --> 02:01:24,939
invisible. We get a Batman mode. Okay. How do I do that? Must be the big guys. Iris activated.

461
02:01:25,500 --> 02:01:52,470
Okay. So that way, but what is over here? Can I turn that? No. This new different music is

462
02:01:52,470 --> 02:02:38,090
playing right now. What? Wait. Oh no, no, no, no, no. Okay. Okay. I'm fine. I'm fine. We're fine.

463
02:02:38,090 --> 02:02:53,640
Eat the egg. That didn't count. That was annoying. Must be the big guys. Let's go.

464
02:03:21,210 --> 02:04:10,979
That's some, uh, that's some TF2 backstab shit right there. Right. Just bite me. Oh,

465
02:04:10,979 --> 02:04:27,130
I got the jacket. Nice. Okay. I should go too. I'm going to go turn it in right now.

466
02:04:27,130 --> 02:04:41,189
It's spinals, right? Crossbow last crossbow. Oh goodness. All right. I got to, I don't think I'm

467
02:04:41,189 --> 02:04:50,069
going to keep that. That's kind of got to go. Yeah, that I don't, I don't think I'm going to

468
02:04:50,069 --> 02:05:10,710
use it. Let me just go back and get this, uh, turning what you're buying. Oh, I have to sell

469
02:05:10,710 --> 02:05:34,710
it. Right. Seven spinals. Okay. So killing me years haven't been kind to us for operative

470
02:05:34,710 --> 02:05:43,609
resources, for operative large resources. What is the, what's the one I need to use?

471
02:05:44,729 --> 02:05:58,739
Okay. So that's the, the larger, small at the maps dude. Yeah, that's a good idea.

472
02:06:00,460 --> 02:06:10,579
Uh, it's large, right? Yeah. Good instincts. I might just get one of these too.

473
02:06:13,239 --> 02:06:20,600
What's worth more purple or probably purple. I can turn this in now. You choose that one.

474
02:06:23,399 --> 02:06:40,409
Okay. Welcome. What can I interest you in? I can upgrade some more stuff. Very nice.

475
02:06:40,729 --> 02:06:51,779
A deal. Well struck. There you are. This thing is now disgusting. All right. I think I'm just

476
02:06:51,779 --> 02:06:56,180
going to sell this thing. I don't think I'm going to use it. I not using really it, you know,

477
02:06:59,609 --> 02:07:04,390
I don't think so. How much is it worth? Do you much good in the gray? Five grand. That's it.

478
02:07:04,949 --> 02:07:18,439
You don't have to keep justifying it. I know that. Right. Hold on a minute. I always go,

479
02:07:18,439 --> 02:07:24,100
you know, I, you know, you know, but the, the, the 40 people in this chat that are going to call

480
02:07:24,100 --> 02:07:47,779
me names because I got rid of the crossbow. He's zipping up his crotch villain arc. I just, I won't

481
02:07:47,779 --> 02:07:51,619
use it. You know me. I'll wait till the last cut scene and shoot it once and miss the guy's head

482
02:07:51,619 --> 02:07:58,409
this way and then reload the save. I'm just going to get rid of the trouble. Decide in a deal.

483
02:07:58,890 --> 02:08:07,590
Struck. Uh, where are the, I got to just get rid of the ammo for it too.

484
02:08:08,149 --> 02:08:22,600
Oh boy. I can certainly do something with this. Give that the care it deserves.

485
02:08:23,640 --> 02:08:35,930
Save my money. Got to select. Thank you. Do check out my wares again soon.

486
02:08:37,529 --> 02:08:47,300
Oh, I have the new case. All right. More resources. This dude absolutely hates his viewers.

487
02:08:47,859 --> 02:08:57,210
He hates us. Somebody said I'm soft locked. You're freaking me out. I know it's, I don't,

488
02:08:57,210 --> 02:09:04,359
I don't think I am, but he hates us. How do I turn off the golden eye clock that's on the

489
02:09:04,359 --> 02:09:27,699
screen right now? How do I get this off? Or is it just on? Oh, right. It needs to be on.

490
02:09:42,250 --> 02:09:46,550
My legs are up in the air right now and I'm just swinging. May as well be at,

491
02:09:47,779 --> 02:11:17,050
may as well be at the park. Now what? Treasure. Where is it? Bullets. Treasure in here. Oh,

492
02:11:17,050 --> 02:11:31,060
it's a, are you in an AI generated chair? I'm going to, I'm going to lift my hand up to smoke

493
02:11:31,060 --> 02:11:46,359
a cigarette and I'm going to have like 14 fingers. So I can't get that. Whatever.

494
02:12:07,590 --> 02:12:27,399
These belong to Louise. That's a lot of money. Okay. So these, did Louise do this? Oh, I remember

495
02:12:27,399 --> 02:12:40,789
this cut scene. Wait, is this where Louise was dancing? There's a lot of, nah, this is when he

496
02:12:40,789 --> 02:13:11,079
was with Leon, right? Look at that. Okay. 4-2-2-1-6-2-5. Okay. Is this his frequency?

497
02:13:11,079 --> 02:13:27,319
Nobody answers an unknown phone number. That's my job. Are you about ready to hand over the

498
02:13:27,319 --> 02:13:34,649
amber? There's a big house just outside the village past the windmill. Yeah, I know it.

499
02:14:14,550 --> 02:14:26,500
And where's the chainsaw?

500
02:14:38,600 --> 02:16:18,649
Where is it? That was fucking scary. Is that loud? I'm sorry. All right. We're good.

501
02:16:33,459 --> 02:16:40,420
Am I scared of the video game or did I put my hand on a fucking hot stove? What, what, what,

502
02:16:40,420 --> 02:16:53,030
what happened? If I put my hand up right now, it's going to be bright red pulsing. Jesus. I need to

503
02:16:53,030 --> 02:17:03,159
settle the fuck down. I don't have a key. And why am I using this rifle? I could have just shot him

504
02:17:03,159 --> 02:17:39,350
one, one second with the gun that's actually upgraded. All right. You shot her a hundred

505
02:17:39,350 --> 02:17:47,770
times in the ass. Oh my God. Is she still alive? I I'm not, I'm not dying there. I'm sorry. I'm not

506
02:17:47,770 --> 02:18:12,860
dying there. I have to, I have to find it. Oopsie. Oh, somebody's saying, oh, so close. Oh, I'm not

507
02:18:12,860 --> 02:18:19,559
going to hit every single bear trap on the ground. Okay. I'm going the absolute wrong way, but there's

508
02:18:19,559 --> 02:18:27,319
money here. Where is it that? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Sorry. I'm turned around. I was

509
02:18:27,319 --> 02:18:38,729
really scared. Where is this? Uh, there we go. Okay. Let's get out of here. Uh, I can't get this.

510
02:18:38,729 --> 02:19:17,879
There is something here. He's shaking. I'm fine. Use some WD 40 on that chair. Oh yeah. It looked

511
02:19:17,879 --> 02:19:43,559
like it did look like that. Oh no. Let's go. There's nothing in here. And I keep, I keep doing it.

512
02:19:43,559 --> 02:19:54,469
I need to take a break so I can fill this back up. It is Wesker. To what do I owe this pleasure?

513
02:19:56,090 --> 02:20:04,020
Stop wasting my time, Ada. Find Lewis, fetch me the Amber. I should probably thank you for this

514
02:20:04,020 --> 02:20:13,379
room. Are you staying? Back me up. I'm not here to babysit you. See that you remain an asset.

515
02:20:13,379 --> 02:20:20,620
I'm not a liability. I have absolutely no use for your incompetence. Easy with the threats,

516
02:20:20,620 --> 02:20:33,770
Wesker. Just get it done. I'll be in touch. Wesker, Wesker, Wesker. Uh, where do you think he gets his

517
02:20:33,770 --> 02:20:48,700
glasses? Yes. Just had some business to attend to. I'm on my way now. See you soon. Ciao. Hey,

518
02:20:48,700 --> 02:20:57,260
there's a lot of treasure over there. All right. Let me, uh, take a quick break. I'm going to get

519
02:20:57,260 --> 02:27:56,299
some, refill my, um, drink. I'll be right back. Give me one sec. Okay. I am kind of back. Just

520
02:27:56,299 --> 02:28:10,780
need to move this back and we're good. Refilled the drink. Yeah, kind of. Well, I'm settling back

521
02:28:10,780 --> 02:28:20,680
down doing some stretches, moving my legs around. You're going to stream on YouTube.

522
02:28:20,680 --> 02:28:28,680
Uh, I don't know. I know I want to do some YouTube content again, but I'm kind of just

523
02:28:28,680 --> 02:28:34,360
playing it by ear and just doing what I feel like on a day-to-day basis, at least in like the content

524
02:28:34,360 --> 02:28:45,510
creation shit besides the off-brand stuff. Cause that is usually, usually spend at least a few

525
02:28:45,510 --> 02:28:55,540
hours. I'd say at least a few hours a month thinking about what I want to do for this.

526
02:28:55,620 --> 02:29:04,549
So I'm just saying words while I get this figured out. I promise I'm not high. I just,

527
02:29:04,549 --> 02:29:21,370
this keyboard, there we go. You didn't deny hating us earlier. I, nah, but, uh, of like the,

528
02:29:21,370 --> 02:29:25,530
the hours I spent off-brand a week trying to still figure out what the good timing to stream is. I

529
02:29:25,530 --> 02:29:40,600
think I got a pretty good schedule here. I would say it. I'm glad you all, I'm glad you all get it.

530
02:29:40,600 --> 02:29:51,420
I'm glad you all think it's humorous. Okay. Let's go back. Good. Make sure the camera's in a good

531
02:29:51,420 --> 02:30:32,540
spot. Yeah. I was happening here. It wasn't tangled. Take a step. I looked in the mirror.

532
02:30:32,540 --> 02:30:40,870
I keep thinking of that person that said I look like the guy that owns the castle. All right. Hi.

533
02:30:40,870 --> 02:30:53,850
Okay. Are you ready? I'm ready. I want them back down. Actually. I love this little keyboard,

534
02:30:53,850 --> 02:31:01,340
this thing before we get started and keep going that I can turn the volume up and down with this.

535
02:31:03,049 --> 02:31:10,200
Okay. Um, take a look at this thing. It's one of these. It's one of those half keyboards,

536
02:31:11,989 --> 02:31:19,079
not a full keyboard. It doesn't have the, uh, all the number pad on it. It's awesome. It's a steel

537
02:31:19,079 --> 02:31:28,090
series apex three. The thing is awesome. Great to just kind of sit right on the lap here. Perfect

538
02:31:28,090 --> 02:31:36,629
little ergonomic form factor, whatever you want to call it. Small keyboard. No, no sponsor. It's

539
02:31:36,629 --> 02:31:46,760
just, I just like it. It's just works great for what it's I'm using it for. And that's it. All

540
02:31:46,760 --> 02:31:53,129
right. What the hell was I just doing? Getting jewels from downstairs. Is this a scary part?

541
02:31:53,129 --> 02:32:26,200
Hey, Hey, bro, bro, bro. Is this a scary part? Where's this? I have everything reloaded. You're

542
02:32:26,200 --> 02:32:36,389
really into bro tonight. Yeah. I'm just hitting me. I'm in one of those. I'm just in a mood. You

543
02:32:36,389 --> 02:32:44,629
know, you get in a mood, you just kind of run with it. Okay. So I need to just go up all the way up

544
02:32:44,629 --> 02:34:02,299
here. I got to go out the front door. I can push out of the way. Yeah. It's going to be some mood

545
02:34:02,299 --> 02:34:39,450
lighting back here. Eventually. It'd be nice. Not just the Pac-Man crew. Well, stereo. It's a Nell

546
02:34:39,450 --> 02:34:59,299
S Ron reunion at Odo. El Mundo. Uh, Ness, a newestro brand. Well, I could've just clicked it.

547
02:34:59,299 --> 02:35:07,059
The outsider is in the villa. Assemble the village. Awaken our great child. Okay.

548
02:35:17,129 --> 02:35:22,569
Come take a look. New item. I've got something new for you, man. Laser sight,

549
02:35:23,959 --> 02:35:39,110
rocket launcher. What you see is what I've got. Oh, a case upgrade. Do I have anything to sell?

550
02:35:39,750 --> 02:35:44,739
Splendid. Uh, yeah, I can do, I'll get the case.

551
02:36:03,750 --> 02:36:14,469
All right. Did I get a knife upgrade? I think I really should make up for a lack of skill.

552
02:36:16,790 --> 02:36:19,510
Maybe just all the way I'll do. Yeah. Case upgrade. I'll do it too.

553
02:36:20,149 --> 02:36:33,930
Shit. I need two bucks. Ruby's all rubbish. It makes no difference. The price.

554
02:36:35,299 --> 02:36:57,430
That's our choice today. Thank you. All yours. Stranger. Where would it come back anytime?

555
02:36:58,389 --> 02:37:14,659
Much better. Can I do any of this? Nope. Sell the shells. Oh, welcome. That's true.

556
02:37:14,659 --> 02:37:22,489
I don't think I plan on doing shotgun. I'll save the money.

557
02:37:27,299 --> 02:37:49,180
What can I interest you in? Nope. Next time then. All right, let's go. Hey, what the fuck?

558
02:37:49,739 --> 02:38:17,930
I still have not figured out how to do the, um, I just almost got crippled. Uh, the grapple thing.

559
02:38:19,540 --> 02:39:48,520
Oh my God. I beat the shit out of me. Hey, really? It won't work. Why is your webcam like this?

560
02:39:49,319 --> 02:39:53,979
Uh, it's temporary. It's uh, it's not where it's going to be, but I think it looks fine.

561
02:39:55,100 --> 02:39:59,420
You guys, you guys spend way too much time caring about the webcam angle and you should be asking

562
02:39:59,420 --> 02:40:06,459
about how I just missed three headshots in a row. That's the real questions you should be asking.

563
02:40:18,680 --> 02:40:23,719
How did you miss three headshots in a row? See, that's why, isn't that better? That's much better.

564
02:40:31,159 --> 02:41:11,850
Okay. There's stuff here. I already got, where is this jewel in this house downstairs? No,

565
02:41:11,850 --> 02:41:39,579
it's in the other house over there. There it is. Very cool. That's yep. Golden chicken egg.

566
02:41:43,850 --> 02:41:50,120
And this is a key that I don't have. Okay. Uh, I want to get all the treasures. So sorry,

567
02:41:50,120 --> 02:41:54,780
everybody. I know we might get bored, but I want to just go get them or at least the ones I can

568
02:41:54,780 --> 02:42:38,149
get. So I'm going to go into the town hall, which is okay. How do I get back into there and why did

569
02:42:38,149 --> 02:42:50,540
I not get it when I was already over there? That's the most annoying part for me. Wasn't I just in

570
02:42:50,540 --> 02:43:22,409
there? Was I not? Apparently I wasn't. Oh, well, how long is the DLC? Um, if you, I think it's like

571
02:43:22,729 --> 02:43:28,340
three to five hours, something like that. Usually about two or four depending on who's playing it

572
02:43:29,139 --> 02:44:23,180
and I'm playing it. So two hours of speed run time and a lot of health. Oh, that's why. Okay.

573
02:44:33,190 --> 02:44:41,879
Ooh, cool. Uh, I guess the best way to see how far I am right now is how many chapters are there?

574
02:44:44,920 --> 02:45:18,739
Six. I imagine probably five, six, seven, seven. Yeah. Everything loaded.

575
02:45:19,219 --> 02:45:30,540
Kind of. All right. So now I'm going to get over here. What's the best way to get over there from

576
02:45:30,540 --> 02:46:11,270
here? This way. What time are you born? 12.00 AM. I don't know, like six. That's a grenade.

577
02:46:21,479 --> 02:46:27,399
It's a bouncy ball. You throw a bouncy ball at me. The bounce on that was fucking ridiculous.

578
02:46:32,819 --> 02:46:55,540
There's no reason why that should have bounced that high. Oh, I thought he went down into the

579
02:46:55,540 --> 02:47:47,610
thing. Okay. Damn. You have an aura of a Looney Tunes physics character. I don't know. Something.

580
02:47:47,610 --> 02:48:28,010
Shit. The knife is broken. Shit. I thought I was far enough away. Am I damaging the knife when I

581
02:48:28,010 --> 02:48:51,670
swing at that? When I hit the crates in the ground? I actually might be. No. Okay. Anything

582
02:48:51,670 --> 02:49:34,200
in there? Can't get up top. Hold on. I can't jump into one of those windows. Really? There's nothing

583
02:49:34,280 --> 02:50:18,170
over here. What kind of horse shit is that? Sell those. Somebody has a grenade somewhere. I love

584
02:50:18,170 --> 02:50:31,559
that you pulled apart your sectional for this stream. You mean all of them going forward.

585
02:50:31,559 --> 02:50:45,219
It ain't just for this one. It's for the rest of them. So Professor X. It looks like Professor

586
02:50:45,219 --> 02:51:19,770
X's chair. Does it? What does the back of Professor X's chair look like? Something's wrong with my

587
02:51:19,770 --> 02:52:17,510
game. Oh, I got seen. I thought that was a baby crying. Sorry, big guy. Can't let you go that way.

588
02:52:17,510 --> 02:52:42,329
Oh, go. Okay. Cool. I'm going to destroy this shit. I throw a grenade in his mouth. I have so

589
02:52:42,329 --> 02:53:23,510
many holes in his head. No, I was trying to jump onto the thing. Get on. Get on. How do I get on?

590
02:53:23,510 --> 02:54:53,190
Cool. Cool. Oh, shit. Let's get the fuck out of here. Is the game loud at all? Looks like it's

591
02:54:53,190 --> 02:55:10,809
kind of loud. I need to drop it by like 10%. It's good. Okay. Looks like it's getting up kind of in

592
02:55:10,809 --> 02:55:20,379
the yellow. Sweet dreams. Now I'm just going to loot the whole thing because there's going to be

593
02:55:20,379 --> 02:55:29,270
a lot of items around, right? Usually there is. Hey, got a smoke? I do. The kind you like. Now

594
02:55:29,270 --> 02:55:36,250
where's the amber? Unfortunately, it's not on me at the moment. And you really shouldn't be telling

595
02:55:36,250 --> 02:55:42,489
me. What a good job I did. Didn't we just do this like an hour ago? Managed to hide it right before

596
02:55:42,489 --> 02:55:53,750
I got caught. Which is why I'm still alive. The deal was we get you out of here when you deliver

597
02:55:53,750 --> 02:56:04,229
the amber. No amber, no protection, Luis. Such a stickler for details, huh, Ida? Okay, then.

598
02:56:04,870 --> 02:56:12,489
I'll go get it now. How about that? It's loud during fights but quiet during cutscenes.

599
02:56:13,540 --> 02:56:19,159
Everything is up all the way. Maybe I should turn the effects down.

600
02:56:26,969 --> 02:57:07,030
Fine. Yeah, it's all right. I'll just leave it. Chapter four. I feel like if those things were

601
02:57:07,030 --> 02:57:16,680
real, you wouldn't. You would just fly into the air and just die. You would do the grapple hook

602
02:57:16,680 --> 02:57:20,840
and you'd be going 50, 60 miles per hour. You would just go straight into the air.

603
02:57:21,319 --> 02:57:29,340
Or straight into the fucking wall and smash your head. It would tear your arm off.

604
02:57:29,340 --> 02:57:33,100
Yeah, you would dislocate your shoulder. Both shoulders if you had it with both hands.

605
02:58:02,709 --> 02:58:09,270
They are both infected. They need this medicine. It slows the infection and I know it works.

606
02:58:10,069 --> 02:58:21,219
I used it on myself. So, why does this matter to me? Because you two are infected. That's what

607
02:58:21,219 --> 02:58:25,299
I researched for all these years, Ida. And I see the symptoms already showing in your eyes.

608
02:58:26,260 --> 02:58:36,309
You must already feel the effects, eh? The medicine will stop them for a time.

609
02:58:37,239 --> 02:58:48,389
Just trust me. A lot to gain and nothing to lose. Okay, but this is your last chance.

610
02:58:49,190 --> 02:59:01,909
We do this first and then the amber. I'll let Leon know.

611
02:59:01,909 --> 02:59:07,610
Hola, Luis here. Las Plagas is fucked. Imagine getting like, imagine seeing one.

612
02:59:08,649 --> 02:59:13,739
Because I have a present I want to give you. Medicine that will help you suppress

613
02:59:13,739 --> 02:59:18,889
the progress of your problem. I can't imagine having to like, see one.

614
02:59:19,770 --> 02:59:22,549
Come to the courtyard. Who is this guy?

615
02:59:23,030 --> 02:59:36,440
Meet up there. Ciao. Sorry to keep you waiting. Shall we? Ladies first.

616
02:59:37,500 --> 02:59:41,299
How chivalrous. I didn't even look if there's any items in the room.

617
02:59:45,639 --> 03:00:11,100
There's a hidden laboratory downstairs. My stuff should be there. Along with the suppressant.

618
03:00:12,219 --> 03:00:29,379
I don't care about a laboratory. We're not going there. We're not going there. I don't want to go

619
03:00:29,379 --> 03:00:37,659
there. We're not going there. There's way till Resident Evil 30 when you get to pick the path

620
03:00:37,659 --> 03:00:44,440
you want to go on. Do you want to go to the lab? Highlight left. Do you want to go to the church?

621
03:00:44,440 --> 03:01:00,280
Highlight right. And the whole time when you're making a decision, what other character in the

622
03:01:00,280 --> 03:01:18,120
cutscene does this? Which way do you want to go? Hey, we don't go out there. I fucked up the line.

623
03:01:18,120 --> 03:01:27,129
I can't. Sorry. All I hear in my head is beep, beep. Like a fucking microwave. The food is done.

624
03:01:27,129 --> 03:01:38,459
I screwed it up so bad. What was I hearing? Was I hearing this?

625
03:01:42,729 --> 03:01:58,469
Wait, what? Are you making fucking popcorn up here? Where'd he go? Oh shit. This is what I

626
03:01:58,469 --> 03:02:22,969
get for not paying attention. Who else is in the room? That was a bugleberry voice. That was an

627
03:02:22,969 --> 03:03:37,510
oh yes. Shit. No, no, no, no. Not yet. I want, I want apple cake. I want apple cake. You've been

628
03:03:37,510 --> 03:03:49,399
fighting this one guy down here for so long. How many bullets did you shoot into this guy? A lot.

629
03:03:49,399 --> 03:03:55,659
I want apple cake. I think three of you are going to know what that's from.

630
03:03:56,059 --> 03:04:27,399
Well, yeah. Monster rancher too. I want apple cake. Uh, I need to heal. Should I just take the

631
03:04:27,399 --> 03:04:59,979
golden egg? No, it's worth a lot of money. He's dying. What's wrong with him? Why is she running

632
03:04:59,979 --> 03:05:29,829
so weird? Oh, he's fucking dead. He's dead. Like in five seconds. I want apple cake.

633
03:05:50,889 --> 03:06:01,959
Get back here. Don't inhale the smoke. It's like he's breathing in as hard as he can.

634
03:06:15,190 --> 03:06:32,979
Just don't breathe forehead. That's right. If you're trying to kill yourself, can you do it

635
03:06:32,979 --> 03:06:42,489
after you've delivered the amber? It's all gone. Burnt to nothing. Why is this so important to you?

636
03:06:43,450 --> 03:06:51,399
There are things I must set right, but that is impossible now. It's all over

637
03:06:52,120 --> 03:07:02,620
and they can't help them anymore. Pull yourself together, Louise. Nice hamster step. You know how

638
03:07:02,620 --> 03:07:17,270
just do it. Yes, it is possible. The ingredients are out here in the castle. Yes, I need time.

639
03:07:17,270 --> 03:07:27,030
I can still get you your amber. All right, then let's go. How many times have I said shut up

640
03:07:27,030 --> 03:07:31,909
that I can go back at least five and figure out our next move. I'm just kidding, though. Don't

641
03:07:31,909 --> 03:07:46,860
worry. Am I? Maybe not. It's at least more than one. Maybe not. I got the item.

642
03:07:49,430 --> 03:08:17,370
Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Slow down. You'd rather be doing anything else right

643
03:08:17,370 --> 03:08:23,739
now. That's not true. I'm having this is fun. I'm having a great time. No, I trust me. You want

644
03:08:23,739 --> 03:08:33,399
about? Well, you can work for the devil as you get me out of here. I'm not. I'm you guys are

645
03:08:33,399 --> 03:08:45,000
mistaking. Relaxed with bored. Boomer face cam gameplay. Yeah, that's how it is now. Sorry.

646
03:08:45,559 --> 03:08:55,959
The way it is now. I think I'm having to join myself immensely right now. This is wonderful.

647
03:09:02,139 --> 03:09:08,739
Oh, yeah. I'm a look. Where's the key? You should be able to use the sword.

648
03:09:08,979 --> 03:09:39,219
Shit. You need a blankie. It won't be my finest effort. I might just work all the

649
03:09:39,219 --> 03:09:43,860
all the way up to my to my neck, the bottom of my neck. Find these ingredients. And one of those

650
03:09:43,860 --> 03:09:51,500
goofy hats. Just maybe I can make a new batch of medicine. I'm not a friend. You go way too hot to

651
03:09:51,500 --> 03:09:56,299
do that. Not right now. Go grab the amber. Wish me luck. Maybe during the winter time. It'd be

652
03:09:56,299 --> 03:10:03,940
funny to do that. Look like an asshole for a little bit. All right. We need red ink, gold

653
03:10:03,940 --> 03:10:17,139
bottle, blue butterfly. They're probably just on the map. They are. Oh, there's a lot of shit.

654
03:10:18,260 --> 03:10:52,680
OK, good luck. This is where we parked this stuff in here. Not really. Can you summarize the plot

655
03:10:52,680 --> 03:11:03,139
in five seconds or less? Bugs get into your brain and control you. And Wesker has a vial,

656
03:11:03,139 --> 03:11:12,760
but it keeps going like this. I think that sums it up pretty well. All right. First,

657
03:11:13,239 --> 03:11:33,610
the bindery. It's this part. All right. Let me take a quick look. Nothing really in here. So

658
03:11:33,610 --> 03:11:47,620
I'm not going to fuck with that. A raccoon. Guess this is fate.

659
03:11:57,340 --> 03:12:08,139
Awesome way. Hey, that's a graphic stone like yourself.

660
03:12:14,020 --> 03:12:22,409
Stones. Welcome. Somebody. Somebody is sub five dollars a month for me to say that every time.

661
03:12:22,409 --> 03:12:25,129
I just want to make sure somebody pays five bucks a month for me to do that.

662
03:12:34,360 --> 03:12:40,040
Ruby's all rubbish. She makes no difference. The price. A deal well struck.

663
03:12:41,799 --> 03:12:53,049
Does this thing maxed out capacity? Dazzled. Does this have a maximum craftsmanship or no?

664
03:12:56,139 --> 03:13:22,170
That's good work. If I do say so myself later, I think that's kind of it. Red nine. I don't

665
03:13:22,170 --> 03:13:28,649
really necessarily care. I don't always have this in stock. Stranger.

666
03:13:31,430 --> 03:13:35,750
Minus one gunpowder when you use my crafting. That's kind of good.

667
03:13:35,750 --> 03:13:40,889
Flash. Actually, I should get that. Oh, remind me that that's their top shape.

668
03:13:42,010 --> 03:13:59,940
Thank you. Check out my wares again soon. The worst. That's the worst harm.

669
03:14:00,739 --> 03:14:33,079
Seem that bad. Do I just put a bunch of these away? Dude, green weed laughing my ass off.

670
03:14:46,090 --> 03:14:59,739
Holy shit. Mod that guy or ban that guy. OK, I I got it saved. I just a compulsive saver.

671
03:14:59,739 --> 03:15:25,180
I'm going to do it again. And let's continue. Green needle rainstorm. Green needle.

672
03:15:41,670 --> 03:16:19,219
I just repaired this thing that's already broken. Incoming puzzle. Fuck. Not yet. Oh,

673
03:16:19,219 --> 03:16:57,299
yeah. OK. Puzzle time. Puzzle time. All right. That's a that's a fan. This bird doesn't match.

674
03:16:57,299 --> 03:17:03,450
Maybe. No, maybe it does. So what's you already did this one in normal mode.

675
03:17:08,540 --> 03:17:15,399
Hear me out for a sec. Yesterday, when you watched the Resident Evil four playthrough

676
03:17:15,399 --> 03:17:23,000
that I did and you watched this part. And today I'm streaming this. You have to remember

677
03:17:23,799 --> 03:17:31,459
that was recorded four and a half months ago. So you got it right there. And here you are

678
03:17:31,459 --> 03:17:38,629
one day later. So I just did this. I just did it on your screen in a while.

679
03:17:39,190 --> 03:17:53,399
I was doing the smiley face. My hair looks so bad. It looks like there's a joke under here.

680
03:17:53,399 --> 03:18:02,809
It looks like I'm about to lift this up and there's going to be like an animal under it.

681
03:18:02,889 --> 03:18:16,329
I look like fucking Edgar Allen Poe. Do I? Holy shit. That's kind of cool. All right. I'm going

682
03:18:16,329 --> 03:18:23,899
to rock it. I'm going to rock with that. All right. What was the point I was making? Oh,

683
03:18:23,899 --> 03:18:49,860
yeah. I don't remember. It's been a while. It's been like two. Bird on the left.

684
03:18:50,420 --> 03:18:57,540
And this be a square up here. I mean, there's only so many combinations this could be, right?

685
03:18:59,500 --> 03:19:19,180
What's going on here? Doesn't this look correct? I'm biting my lip. Get off the cam.

686
03:19:37,290 --> 03:19:46,600
Hmm. I just don't remember. I need another orange one, don't I? Is there another one in the room

687
03:19:46,600 --> 03:20:42,440
that I'm just missing? Hmm. The fuck am I doing wrong here? What the heck? I'm subbed to this

688
03:20:42,440 --> 03:20:58,409
dork. Oh, what the heck's happening here? Obviously, this needs to be a square. This

689
03:20:58,409 --> 03:21:27,260
needs to be a I don't what I'm like, I feel like I'm missing a piece. I guess not. The hell am I

690
03:21:27,260 --> 03:21:32,860
doing wrong? It's there's only so many this only like what, 16 combinations is only like 20

691
03:21:32,860 --> 03:22:01,209
combinations. This could be. Hmm. I am munching on my lip and I got to stop. Hold on. True.

692
03:22:01,209 --> 03:22:11,139
When a puzzle comes up, I just start tearing into my bottom lip. Dorito goes into the wind.

693
03:22:23,270 --> 03:22:46,299
So you would need the bird needs wind. The dress needs a bird and the bird needs wind.

694
03:22:50,500 --> 03:22:58,790
Bird needs that. I actually don't know. I have no idea. This shouldn't be this hard,

695
03:22:58,790 --> 03:23:05,739
but I'm playing checkers when you need to play. I'm playing chess when you need to play

696
03:23:06,459 --> 03:23:13,219
like hopscotch, like it's not even hard. I'm saying cheese, cheese, Dorito, cheese, cheese,

697
03:23:13,219 --> 03:23:27,540
cheese, Dorito, Dorito. Illuminati symbol. Tornado. Tornado. Tornado needs a weather.

698
03:23:27,540 --> 03:23:38,360
It's bad weather. It's I'm playing Pictionary again. Like the one of these has to be down here

699
03:23:38,360 --> 03:23:53,430
or here. What am I missing? What's happening to me? Dorito sugar. Yeah. Stinky cheese. No sloth.

700
03:24:04,280 --> 03:24:34,040
I feel like I've done every single combination you could possibly do. Um, I don't do puzzles.

701
03:24:34,040 --> 03:24:39,379
I do pick Russ and that's it. I just know how to run wicked fast for like five seconds.

702
03:24:40,459 --> 03:24:46,629
And like, I like, I, I, I don't know. I don't get it. How many combinations can it possibly

703
03:24:46,709 --> 03:24:53,530
be that I haven't done umbrellas, dress, and bird. And I did this four months ago.

704
03:24:53,530 --> 03:24:59,219
A person is watching the video of me saying the same shit right now. Pull it up. I'm doing,

705
03:24:59,219 --> 03:25:02,420
I'm saying the exact same. You know what? How about we just pull the video up when I'm doing it?

706
03:25:02,420 --> 03:25:11,979
And I'll say, I'll just ask myself, I will talk to myself. I don't even know where it is. That's

707
03:25:11,979 --> 03:25:14,940
a, that's like a whole, that's a whole can of worms. I don't even know what timestamp it is.

708
03:25:15,579 --> 03:25:31,670
What's the timestamp on the, on the VOD in a mod link, the VOD with timestamp. I need to open the,

709
03:25:33,500 --> 03:25:59,370
uh, I need to have mod chat open. Yeah. Okay. I got it. I got it open now. Wait, wait, wait,

710
03:25:59,370 --> 03:26:21,510
wait, wait, wait, wait. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.

711
03:26:21,510 --> 03:27:05,659
Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. We just don't know. You don't know. Let me ask,

712
03:27:05,659 --> 03:27:32,069
let me ask you, uh, me from like four months ago. Did someone find it? I don't think so.

713
03:27:33,899 --> 03:27:40,500
It's like, it's like three streams, but I just, I just don't get it. Like, and I,

714
03:27:40,500 --> 03:27:47,930
it's going to be so obvious, but I just don't care. Do you know what I mean? I would just throw

715
03:27:47,930 --> 03:27:51,290
a grenade at this wall. I would, you know what? I would just call somebody. I would be like,

716
03:27:51,290 --> 03:27:55,530
Hey Wesker, what's up? Hey, what's up, dude? I'm sitting at a wall. Look, I'm the guy that

717
03:27:55,530 --> 03:28:00,409
runs fast. And like, you know, you keep me around because I tell jokes and I, you know, I'm a writer

718
03:28:02,010 --> 03:28:06,649
I'd be dead in a minute, by the way. Oh, oh, you're, oh, you're a writer. You tell you write

719
03:28:06,649 --> 03:28:12,170
jokes. Yeah. I don't fucking need you at all. Actually. Let me, I don't need a writer.

720
03:28:17,739 --> 03:28:21,370
Uh, what do you want? All right. So I'm looking at this thing right now, Wesker.

721
03:28:22,090 --> 03:28:29,209
Uh, there's a bird and there's a cutoff symbol. There's a cutoff bird. There's a fan at the top

722
03:28:30,010 --> 03:28:38,329
and that's orange. The bird and the fan are both orange and this fan has a square on it. Okay.

723
03:28:39,129 --> 03:28:46,569
Okay. Are you with me here? So far? On the right, there is a, a dress in a hexagon shape.

724
03:28:46,569 --> 03:28:50,969
Dress. What kind of dress is it? It's, it's got one of those poofy dresses from like the

725
03:28:50,969 --> 03:28:56,409
1400s or something. A poofy 1400s dress. Yes. That, that's exactly it. The ones that like,

726
03:28:56,409 --> 03:29:00,889
they have like big cage in them. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. The big ones. Okay. I got that down.

727
03:29:01,530 --> 03:29:04,649
Okay. Then the bottom, this, remember it's two umbrellas. So there's a second umbrella at the

728
03:29:04,649 --> 03:29:08,889
bottom of the hexagon as well. Regular umbrella. It's just like one of those umbrellas. It's got

729
03:29:08,889 --> 03:29:14,409
like frills on it. Frilly umbrella. Also from the 1400s. Yes. Actually, yes. Okay. So let me think

730
03:29:14,409 --> 03:29:34,250
here. So what I think is, and there's four slots. They have four slots. Uh, let them out. I don't

731
03:29:34,250 --> 03:29:41,129
care. Just let them out. Just tell me what to do. I don't care. I don't care. Just tell me what it

732
03:29:41,129 --> 03:29:46,309
is. We can do it together. It's fun that way. We're doing it together. We're going to do it

733
03:29:46,309 --> 03:29:57,459
together. Yeah. See chat. We're hanging out. We're doing it together. Rotate them. What do you mean

734
03:29:57,459 --> 03:30:27,020
rotate them? Okay. Listen, you have to understand. I thought that was telling me that I could move

735
03:30:27,020 --> 03:30:39,690
them. I, the Q and the E were, were not rotate in my brain. Wow. Shit. Oh, that's on the internet

736
03:30:39,690 --> 03:30:43,129
now. Do you know what I mean? Like that's not, that's on, that's like on the, that's on the

737
03:30:43,129 --> 03:30:52,540
internet now forever. I'm sitting kind of far away from the screen. I it's like, it's a different

738
03:30:52,540 --> 03:30:59,819
setup. I, to me, the, the rotate was not there. Oh my God. That's yeah. I can't believe it.

739
03:31:05,399 --> 03:31:12,600
I had to remember. I'm not pretending at all at all. Zero pretending absolute zero.

740
03:31:13,399 --> 03:31:19,000
I was just so lasered it. I don't even know how I was so lazy. That's the worst moment ever.

741
03:31:19,719 --> 03:31:29,110
You don't have the attention span for directions. I, that, that's probably the worst, uh, the worst

742
03:31:29,110 --> 03:31:40,469
ever, ever in 15 years of doing this. I just had to go like this. And I don't, I don't have an

743
03:31:40,469 --> 03:31:50,139
excuse for you. I really don't. My only excuse is I can see it now is just ADHD. That's the only

744
03:31:50,139 --> 03:31:56,920
excuse. That's it. I can't tell you another reason why I genuinely could not tell you another reason

745
03:31:56,920 --> 03:32:06,649
why, because I, my brain, the Q and the E were not on the screen. They were just not on screen.

746
03:32:06,649 --> 03:32:10,940
They were gone. They weren't there until you brought that up. That's crazy. What a fucking

747
03:32:10,940 --> 03:32:19,319
case study. That's an unbelievable case study for ADHD because wow. We, you just watched it.

748
03:32:19,319 --> 03:32:26,059
Did I do it in the last one too? We've got the timestamp for the last one. Did I do it in the

749
03:32:26,059 --> 03:32:39,459
last one? Glasses in the cutscene. Yeah, they really are just ruining everything. All right.

750
03:32:39,459 --> 03:32:57,770
This is the maze part, isn't it? My name is May. You can tell what game I was playing

751
03:32:58,729 --> 03:33:21,209
six months ago. Oh my fucking God. I can't believe I didn't see it. How I do it again. I do it again.

752
03:33:21,209 --> 03:33:25,690
I do it again. It happens. It happens back here too. I don't rotate it guys. We're talking about

753
03:33:25,690 --> 03:33:34,200
this as consistency. It's consistency. It is absolute consistency. I'm just, I'm not, I haven't

754
03:33:34,200 --> 03:33:42,360
spun them once. I think I'm, am I missing one? Let's just listen to them for a little while.

755
03:33:43,000 --> 03:33:59,860
Oh wait, you can flip them. Oops. Took them a lot quicker. Hey, I'm retired now. It's all right.

756
03:33:59,860 --> 03:34:22,819
Okay. Well it's been, sure been fun. All right. So this goes here. This goes here and

757
03:34:24,469 --> 03:35:09,370
this needs to be a square. Where is the, where is that? I don't have a, I can't,

758
03:35:09,370 --> 03:35:12,329
I can't tell you what just happened there. The first ingredient should be in this room.

759
03:35:16,940 --> 03:35:21,899
The only thing I can attribute it to is being sitting in this new room and being like this.

760
03:35:22,620 --> 03:35:38,809
That's it. Oh well. Oh well. Hey, hey, hey, the mod chat. How could you let me fucking do it?

761
03:35:38,809 --> 03:35:41,850
You should have said rotate the fucking cubes, man. You should have, I should have looked over

762
03:35:41,850 --> 03:35:46,409
and it should have been like, hey, rotate the fucking cubes already. You should have gave me,

763
03:35:46,409 --> 03:35:58,520
you should have given me some extra fucking direction. Wait, did they? No, they didn't.

764
03:35:58,520 --> 03:36:30,899
No, they didn't. Okay. Let's go touch it. Ooh, I get to do the shooting thing. Is that in this?

765
03:36:31,459 --> 03:36:45,700
You're sitting too far away. That actually might be what happened. And I know, you know,

766
03:36:45,700 --> 03:36:52,139
streamer dumb. I know. I know. But I think that's probably why I didn't see it. I was moving them

767
03:36:52,139 --> 03:36:56,780
too quickly and I, you know, I'm not going to give excuses anymore. That was really stupid.

768
03:36:56,780 --> 03:37:22,219
Oh well. Okay. Watch your eyes. He's too, he's too comfortable. Uh, I think my brain

769
03:37:22,219 --> 03:37:30,219
saw them as like A and D to like move them, not rotate. Okay. I mean, let me stop giving excuses

770
03:37:30,219 --> 03:37:47,290
to why that just happened and play the game. So where is it? Red ink or blue ink or something?

771
03:37:47,290 --> 03:38:12,020
Where is it? Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Get shooting. So shoot the shields. Who has a shield? Okay. So

772
03:38:12,020 --> 03:38:32,899
what's the order? 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4. That not correct. All right. Wait, wait, hold on. Zoom

773
03:38:32,899 --> 03:39:17,209
it in. Let me get close. Let me go. Let me get close. One is, so wait, it's what is it? It's 1,

774
03:39:19,020 --> 03:39:40,899
1. Hold on. 1, 2, 3. Is that right? 1, 2, 3. No, it's the way that they're on the wall.

775
03:39:40,899 --> 03:40:22,379
So where the fuck is this one? Look around. Oh Jesus. Okay. There's other ones. Okay. So that

776
03:40:22,459 --> 03:40:31,420
was, this is it here. So that's the right one over here. And then it's one. Where is this?

777
03:40:34,979 --> 03:40:44,739
That's okay. That's like an elk, elk, elk, lady, little lady. All right. So where's the,

778
03:40:44,739 --> 03:40:52,860
where's the elk? I mean, bro, what does that even matter? Or you just shoot it in the right

779
03:40:52,860 --> 03:41:03,270
direction? 1, 2, 3, like this. Am I playing chess again? I don't know. Hold on. Did I have it right

780
03:41:03,270 --> 03:41:27,239
when I spun it? 1, 2. Yeah. Okay. Spin it. 1, 2, 3, 4. Is that not right? There's no way. Well,

781
03:41:27,239 --> 03:41:36,920
I, I flipped it though, right? You're playing battleship on a chessboard. I'm laughing so hard

782
03:41:36,920 --> 03:42:22,600
right now. Okay. Well that's the correct one. 1, 2, 3. 1, 2. I gotta do it upside down. 1, 2, 3.

783
03:42:22,600 --> 03:42:36,170
Why is he flipping it? I must be fucking tired. Am I like sleepy? Holy shit. I am like 40. Okay.

784
03:42:38,979 --> 03:43:07,479
1, 1, 2, 3. Shit. Jesus. I gotta get my fucking eyes examined. Holy shit.

785
03:43:09,819 --> 03:43:26,649
Oh my God. I'm like, I'm like too comfortable. Jesus. That was 15 minutes. Dude. Is it,

786
03:43:26,649 --> 03:43:35,370
is there carbon monoxide going into your room? Jeez, man. That was fucking ridiculous.

787
03:44:15,590 --> 03:44:48,649
Change the outfit? I can't. I have to keep it like this. It's too good.

788
03:44:51,930 --> 03:45:15,700
Right. How about we continue this discussion another time? See you around. He looks like

789
03:45:15,700 --> 03:45:55,190
Jerry Seinfeld. Okay. Let's go. Do I have any of the fun hats for Leon? Okay. So,

790
03:45:57,610 --> 03:46:21,700
there is another thing down here. The gate and gong have the same sense.

791
03:46:23,059 --> 03:46:29,610
Seems simple enough. All right. Snakes. This is a snake right here, right?

792
03:46:30,729 --> 03:46:50,010
Does it just shoot snake twice? Is there another snake? There is. You should bedazzle the recliner.

793
03:46:50,809 --> 03:47:55,450
No, not this shit. Turn and run? What the fuck? Open the door. Um, oh, you need to wear your

794
03:47:55,450 --> 03:48:08,409
glasses. I think it's a combination of visual distance and ADHD object permanence. Like in

795
03:48:08,409 --> 03:48:12,329
my brain right now, I can say, hey, that's an elk right there. And when I turn around,

796
03:48:12,329 --> 03:48:31,879
it's an elephant. It's gone. It's carbon monoxide. It's it's no, I have a detector.

797
03:48:31,879 --> 03:48:41,379
You're making me think for a second. You're like, oh, I'm like, oh shit. Being high doesn't help.

798
03:48:42,020 --> 03:48:53,270
Yeah, that's true. Okay. Now for the second ingredient. Give me these jewels. I want it.

799
03:48:53,270 --> 03:49:38,180
Looks like something goes here. Okay. Oh shit. It's one of these guys. Holy shit. That was cool.

800
03:50:12,090 --> 03:51:01,159
I probably have to pick that up again. I'm imagining more stuff. Okay. No key. What?

801
03:51:01,159 --> 03:52:10,760
I think I know what's coming. Yeah. Okay. Gold bottle. Oh my goodness. Okay. Oh boy.

802
03:52:10,760 --> 03:52:41,030
Whoa. What just hit me? Almost out of bullets. Oh, you piece of shit. Leave me alone.

803
03:52:57,940 --> 03:53:13,899
Come here. Come here. Come here. Oh my God. You little shits over there. Leave me alone.

804
03:53:14,700 --> 03:54:10,360
Holy. Holy. Now I get a minute. Let me this, this, this jewels in here. Okay. So I have both

805
03:54:10,360 --> 03:54:33,370
the bottles. Do I want to do anything else in this room or no? I don't think so. Do I have a

806
03:54:33,370 --> 03:55:25,690
favorite gem? Um, probably birthstone. That's the easy answer. Stone of birth. What? Uh, should I go

807
03:55:25,690 --> 03:55:39,260
back and check for that treasure? I feel like I should, but I think it's a key. I think it's a

808
03:55:39,260 --> 03:55:51,590
key. I don't think I have a key to open it. I need the gold bottle. I need to keep the gold

809
03:55:51,590 --> 03:56:25,190
bottle. So I'm not leaving that. There are blue medallions here. Okay. Out there. There's no

810
03:56:25,190 --> 03:56:45,049
inputs on these. I guess not. All right. I want, what do I want to do here?

811
03:56:48,579 --> 03:57:04,280
Starting to get good luck to you. There you are. I'll keep a lookout for items.

812
03:57:05,639 --> 03:57:27,129
Okay. Hmm. Is there, is there another knife that I find later? I can do the whole DLC tonight.

813
03:57:28,649 --> 03:57:40,739
Probably. Yeah, probably. There's only a few more chapters. There's only two more chapters.

814
03:57:41,459 --> 03:57:57,450
Yeah. It's a lock drawer. All right. The last one is over way up here.

815
03:57:57,450 --> 03:58:10,819
So I'm going to go through the courtyard. I want that, whatever that is. Okay. Louise,

816
03:58:11,379 --> 03:58:22,700
that's two. Last one should be in a room accessible from the castle wall. And here's

817
03:58:22,700 --> 03:58:39,940
some more info I've recovered about that old rock. Sending it now. Okay. Reload everything.

818
03:58:39,940 --> 03:58:47,579
And where are the medallions? Can I jump this? I don't need to jump it. It's just right here.

819
03:58:48,219 --> 03:59:13,209
Okay. That was easy. All right. Let's go medallion hunting. Oh wait, there are fishes in there,

820
03:59:13,209 --> 03:59:37,420
aren't there? Does that work? Oh, it does. Probably. This is just health, right? Take the

821
03:59:37,420 --> 04:00:26,579
free health. Wait a minute. Something over here. I think that's it. Yep. Turn on your real face

822
04:00:26,579 --> 04:00:44,680
scan. You don't like my, my made up one. It's like a weird mustache. There's only actually

823
04:00:44,680 --> 04:01:08,500
one treasure in here. Sting. Now, where are the others? Oh, God damn it. You wouldn't just let

824
04:01:08,500 --> 04:01:45,350
me through, could you? Don't kill him. Oh, he fell. I didn't have to do anything. Shut up.

825
04:01:45,350 --> 04:02:11,159
Can I throw a grenade in there? I think I got him. I got some. Oh my goodness. Run. Okay. You

826
04:02:11,159 --> 04:02:44,569
are dead. Thank goodness. Yes. This thing does not do a whole lot of damage without any upgrades.

827
04:02:45,209 --> 04:03:30,780
I want that. So you better believe I'm going to go get it. How do I get? It's over here.

828
04:03:30,940 --> 04:04:08,940
Oh, hold on. Is it a chest? It is. I think I have enough to upgrade to. Oh, not good. Not good. Not

829
04:04:08,940 --> 04:04:38,059
good. Not good. Not good. Damn. I got a million health. Okay. That was ridiculous. Bro, you are

830
04:04:38,059 --> 04:05:00,360
fucking gaming. I am. Okay. So one up here, one over here. I don't think there's any more treasure.

831
04:05:02,360 --> 04:05:32,299
Uh, hold on. Let me go up here. I could just go over there. Where's this one? It's in the building.

832
04:05:32,299 --> 04:05:44,700
I like the stash. I get, uh, I don't know how long it's going to be here for. It will only be

833
04:05:44,700 --> 04:05:58,389
here as long as it'll be here for enough time. Enough time. All right. Where is this thing?

834
04:05:58,389 --> 04:06:52,379
It's like in that building. Is it in the building? How do I get in this building? No, no, no. There

835
04:06:52,379 --> 04:07:12,440
we go. Okay. It's in here, right? No, it's not. Where is it? Where is it? Did I run by like three

836
04:07:12,440 --> 04:07:37,030
times? Ah, okay. There it is. Last one is in the corner. Is it just right up here? You look like

837
04:07:37,030 --> 04:07:45,479
one of the weasels from Roger Rabbit. Oh, that's awesome. I'm so glad you just said that. That's,

838
04:07:45,479 --> 04:07:55,209
that's who I am. That's legitimately who I am as a person. All of them combined. I feel like I embody

839
04:07:55,209 --> 04:08:05,829
every single one of those characters together as one, as one unit. All right. So I can turn,

840
04:08:06,309 --> 04:08:19,190
I'll turn it in later. Now I'm going to go through here. Can I get there from this one?

841
04:08:32,379 --> 04:08:48,819
Egg? Oh, it's a leaf. All right. Reload this. Reload this thing. What an egomaniac. Um,

842
04:08:52,139 --> 04:08:56,540
they all died. They all die at the end of the movie, by the way. I just want to make sure

843
04:08:56,540 --> 04:09:04,440
you're aware of that. Like they all die. What do you mean, bro? What? What do you mean? What?

844
04:09:04,440 --> 04:09:14,920
Spoiled? Spoilers? Did I not say spoilers? It's the movie's 40 years old and I'm making that up

845
04:09:14,920 --> 04:09:23,059
too. They don't all die. I thought that was required reading for the stream already. Oh,

846
04:09:23,059 --> 04:09:28,420
I thought we already all seen it already a million times. Sorry about that. It's like a,

847
04:09:28,420 --> 04:09:33,270
it's like one part of the movie. Don't worry. That was summer homework. Well,

848
04:09:33,270 --> 04:09:43,540
that was summer homework in like 2019. I thought we'd all seen it already. I think we all have

849
04:09:43,540 --> 04:09:56,329
some, maybe some of you haven't. I don't know. It's a great movie. I love that movie. I think

850
04:09:56,329 --> 04:10:02,420
most of you've already seen it. I'd say majority probably. All right. One's in chat. If you have

851
04:10:02,420 --> 04:10:11,110
not seen Roger Rabbit, I feel like you, there's no way that many of you haven't seen it. No way.

852
04:10:13,540 --> 04:10:20,059
Really? Oh, well go watch it. What are you doing? Like one of the best movies ever.

853
04:10:42,840 --> 04:11:13,370
No treasures. What? I did not mean to press that. That's right. I still have some unfinished

854
04:11:13,370 --> 04:11:28,379
business to take care of. Did I not kill the thing? I thought I did. Nothing there. Okay.

855
04:11:28,700 --> 04:11:35,209
Grab this. Somebody's on the phone.

856
04:11:46,340 --> 04:11:53,430
Sorry. Nothing yet, but my little helper is creating quite the commotion. I have a little

857
04:11:53,430 --> 04:12:11,100
helper? Everything will work out just fine. Oh, Louis. Louis. Leon. Yeah, Louis. Was that guy's

858
04:12:11,100 --> 04:12:35,340
name again? Louis? Jesus. Leon. Changed your mind yet? Yeah. Assuming you haven't. I've got a tip

859
04:12:35,340 --> 04:12:41,209
for you. Seems like something big is about to go down in the throne room. Babysitting's tough, huh?

860
04:12:43,079 --> 04:12:47,799
Hey, it's me Wesker again. You know that anybody can go on a channel and hear anything

861
04:12:47,799 --> 04:12:54,819
across a fucking walkie talkie. I just want to make sure you understood that. Wesker out.

862
04:12:59,860 --> 04:13:05,129
Okay. I am going to go this way. Wait. I'm going to go this way actually, because I want to go.

863
04:13:05,129 --> 04:13:36,700
Should I get this treasure? Yes. Thanks for answering my question. It's down even further.

864
04:13:52,120 --> 04:13:57,979
What are your tips on growing a mustache? I cannot give you any because I grow a terrible mustache.

865
04:13:58,620 --> 04:14:03,459
I've heard you have to just stick with it, but even if I stick with it for a month or two,

866
04:14:03,459 --> 04:14:12,549
it looks like a bird shit on the top of my lip. I don't know if I have any tips for you.

867
04:14:18,709 --> 04:14:53,540
All right. Let's check in up here. I will check below, but not yet. Now I'll go below.

868
04:15:04,819 --> 04:15:22,729
All right. So this one will open if I do that again. Where are you going? It's not going to

869
04:15:22,729 --> 04:15:46,950
happen. You would fit in well in an American civil war teledrama. It's an evil mustache.

870
04:15:46,950 --> 04:16:13,899
It is kind of evil. That's all right. Okay. So that is closed. We need to open. Wait,

871
04:16:14,459 --> 04:16:20,790
anything else back here? Was there another sun or anything? I'll just open it again.

872
04:16:23,540 --> 04:16:39,479
Actually, wait. I want to go down here because I feel like I missed something in here. No,

873
04:16:39,479 --> 04:16:57,420
it's the next room. Okay. All right. So if I go up here, I think I just get back up. I don't really

874
04:16:57,420 --> 04:17:11,799
need to do that again, do I? Go back up. Nothing else? You're like a hamster running around.

875
04:17:11,879 --> 04:17:50,760
Yeah. Yeah. Wait, did I not? Wait a minute. I didn't go over here. A yellow diamond. Nice.

876
04:17:57,139 --> 04:18:04,219
This must be the collection room. Blue butterfly.

877
04:18:04,219 --> 04:18:15,799
Blue butterfly. The collection master is a tacky and lousy boss. He leaves all the dissections

878
04:18:15,799 --> 04:18:23,129
for me to do, even if he does not bother to come here. All he does is up at his three favorite

879
04:18:23,129 --> 04:18:28,229
specimens in a particular order before leaving. There's nothing special about them in any way.

880
04:18:28,309 --> 04:18:35,799
Well, only look at those three specimens. Mr. Wonderful. When we pay attention, don't act like

881
04:18:35,799 --> 04:18:49,459
a fucking joker. It's a puzzle. Pay attention. All right. Order. Okay. So the butterflies have

882
04:18:49,459 --> 04:18:55,659
to be in a certain order. We're on emote only. Yeah. I don't think that will happen again,

883
04:18:55,659 --> 04:19:07,459
if I will be honest with you. Good to know. Okay. So sort of put their hands on this thing.

884
04:19:10,329 --> 04:19:23,639
Skulls. Oh, bugs. Bugs and geodes. This is like my favorite room. Anything else I can interact

885
04:19:23,639 --> 04:19:33,719
with? The shoes, right? So what did you do? You touched a beetle. Then you touched this head.

886
04:19:38,120 --> 04:19:44,760
And I think that's it. You also went over here and you touched salamander, whatever that is.

887
04:19:45,319 --> 04:20:08,389
No matter what order. All right. What are the options? It's butterfly, head, beetle, alligator,

888
04:20:08,389 --> 04:20:15,110
beetle, snake, butterfly, head, beetle. All right. There's two different beetles.

889
04:20:20,229 --> 04:20:27,879
You put your hands all over this thing. What kind of beetle is it? It's a beetle that's going like

890
04:20:27,879 --> 04:20:59,000
this. Okay. Does it matter the order? Probably. Would you eat any of the bugs? No, of course not.

891
04:20:59,000 --> 04:21:23,159
Well, I guess where do they start? Started here. You went beetle, beetle, skull, beetle, skull,

892
04:21:23,159 --> 04:21:32,250
salamander. Okay. There it is. There you go. Okay. Good. Give me that butterfly.

893
04:21:32,250 --> 04:21:58,329
You got everything you need, but exactly what you want. Well, that's not good. The parasite

894
04:21:58,329 --> 04:22:05,909
is reacting to the ember. So that's the ember. That looks like something Wesker would want.

895
04:22:06,549 --> 04:22:46,389
Give me a case. This will knock out the parasite, but only for a time. You ready?

896
04:22:55,659 --> 04:23:00,819
Kind of looks like a grimace shape. Just remember, it's not a cure. We still need

897
04:23:00,819 --> 04:23:26,500
to find a way to get that thing out of you. This guy again. I don't understand. It should

898
04:23:26,500 --> 04:23:34,549
be working by now. Take the ember and go. Once the parasite is sedated, you can give me back

899
04:23:34,549 --> 04:23:41,270
that damn stone. I can't leave you here. Not like this. Spare me. I'll be fine. You got another

900
04:23:41,270 --> 04:23:56,280
promise to keep. Right. But you come find me as soon as you're done here. Okay. Well, round three.

901
04:23:56,280 --> 04:24:40,579
Do I have any ammo? Oh, no. I'm just going. Okay. She's cured. I should have peed. I have to pee.

902
04:25:23,239 --> 04:25:35,989
I'm just rocking around. Okay. I'm going to pee. I'll be right back. Maybe this might be

903
04:25:37,030 --> 04:30:33,430
one more break after this. We'll see. I'm just going to go. Be right back. I have returned.

904
04:30:34,149 --> 04:30:43,239
He must be going through some shit in there. Yeah, I was going through some shit in the bathroom.

905
04:30:56,329 --> 04:31:16,540
Uh, wait, where's my headphones? Why are you pouring tea in the toilet? That is a good question

906
04:31:16,540 --> 04:31:24,090
because I got a good answer for you. When I, I used to talk about tea all the time. I used to

907
04:31:24,090 --> 04:31:36,360
drink tea all the time. I still do sometimes, but that's a, it's like a 2017, 2016, uh, lore.

908
04:31:36,360 --> 04:31:40,950
And also people used to say that they could hear me peeing into the toilet every time I went to

909
04:31:40,950 --> 04:31:54,620
the bathroom. So kind of a combination of a few things. All right, let's get back to it. Are we

910
04:31:54,620 --> 04:32:18,309
ready? Chapter five. Yeah. Loud pee. Yeah, that's what it was. Okay. Make sure you get the stuff.

911
04:32:23,819 --> 04:32:40,100
No stuff. Louise's footprints must've gone this way. It's handprints. All right. So I get it.

912
04:32:40,100 --> 04:32:58,250
So that's a, what is it? A moon? So here's a sun. Okay. Moons are open. Is that? Oh,

913
04:32:58,250 --> 04:33:13,830
it's just a locked door. Okay. Okay. Moons are open. Let me check over here. Wait,

914
04:33:26,520 --> 04:33:50,659
sun needs to be opened. Chronicles of pursuit. Okay. Continue with my current method to change

915
04:33:50,659 --> 04:34:06,310
nothing, but instead widen my search. My microphone needs to be closer. Okay. What

916
04:34:06,310 --> 04:34:10,389
color is each subject? We know green is always science, but what's red, blue, et cetera.

917
04:34:13,979 --> 04:34:25,930
Hmm. To me, red is math, right? Just like, Oh man, it's math. What about like social studies

918
04:34:26,009 --> 04:34:39,909
is still social studies is blue. I think math is blue. Hmm. Yeah. No red. Now red is math.

919
04:34:42,250 --> 04:34:58,549
Science is green. Yeah, for sure. Making sure I don't miss it. This is open now. Okay. So now I

920
04:34:58,549 --> 04:35:09,459
can open this and go down English. You know, math might actually be yellow and English might be blue.

921
04:35:16,900 --> 04:35:28,419
That's tough. You're demented for that. I it's tough though, because I don't know. It's a good

922
04:35:28,419 --> 04:35:54,569
question. Okay. So, uh, I need this to be a moon. It's not a moon. I can't go anywhere else. Hmm.

923
04:35:54,569 --> 04:36:04,919
Okay. Wait, there's nothing else I can do up here. Right? Yeah. This is a, this is a, this is a moon

924
04:36:05,880 --> 04:36:22,330
that I haven't read the first time. Fight chat fight. Um, green might not always be science.

925
04:36:22,330 --> 04:36:30,939
Science might be blue because of like, I don't know, water like, Ooh, like Marine life. Does

926
04:36:30,939 --> 04:36:41,259
that make sense? If a green could also be now. Yeah, you're right. Green is always science. No

927
04:36:41,259 --> 04:36:46,900
matter what. I think that's a given. Okay. Hold on. I got, I got to play the video again. I just

928
04:36:46,900 --> 04:37:14,090
walked up and down the same set of stairs three times. Okay. Okay. Hmm. Can I shoot it up there?

929
04:37:14,810 --> 04:37:34,919
I can't. So this has to be a sun. So I have to jump across and just, okay. So hold on.

930
04:37:43,259 --> 04:37:53,939
Can I go across, but that's not, wait, hold on. I want to, I want to screw this up.

931
04:37:54,580 --> 04:38:02,790
Do I have it? I have it right now. I think I do. Cause then I pull it one more time and then

932
04:38:03,590 --> 04:38:08,229
down here, I'll pull it and it'll be back to normal. I think, right. You guys still fight

933
04:38:08,229 --> 04:38:14,619
to both the subjects. Uh, okay. French is what color is math? Red. A lot of people said radio

934
04:38:19,450 --> 04:38:25,459
math is white. Blue is math because it's cold and logical. Green is science because plants and

935
04:38:25,459 --> 04:38:49,419
chlorophyll. Hold on. Let me, I got to read this. Oh, hold on. I got deleted. Yeah. Green is always

936
04:38:49,419 --> 04:39:13,450
science about orange. What would be red besides math? I'm going to leave that up for now. Social

937
04:39:13,450 --> 04:39:25,669
studies is orange. Yeah. That's that. That does seem pretty, that seems pretty accurate. I'd kind

938
04:39:25,669 --> 04:39:45,189
of have to look at it. I would need to have the colors in the notebooks. Red is health. White

939
04:39:45,189 --> 04:40:00,060
could be health too. So could red. Red could be health or blood. Down we go. Green is health. Oh,

940
04:40:00,060 --> 04:40:11,979
I don't know. I think green is always science. What is this? I'll leave some signs to point you

941
04:40:11,979 --> 04:40:18,299
in the right direction. Okay. He really knows his way around this place. Treasure over here.

942
04:40:18,860 --> 04:40:47,779
Red is good for electives. Yeah. I'm thinking white would be, I think English is blue.

943
04:40:48,979 --> 04:41:04,459
English is blue. Health is white or red. Math is red or orange. Science is green.

944
04:41:05,259 --> 04:41:13,080
What about gym? Well, Jim, you don't like, you don't like study in gym in a notebook.

945
04:41:18,330 --> 04:41:38,229
Jim, hope it's not a sign of things to come. Oh, not these fucking things. Okay. I'll get it there.

946
04:41:38,869 --> 04:42:30,220
Move. What about wizard class? Uh, what about purple? I feel like purple is too

947
04:42:31,180 --> 04:42:38,360
cool of a color to be a subject. Does that make any sense? It's too hip, I think, to be a subject.

948
04:42:39,159 --> 04:43:08,759
It won't open. Not swimming in that. Math is purple. Let's keep doing this. Purple's for the

949
04:43:08,759 --> 04:43:23,740
dark arts. Shit. Okay. Hold on. What's on the other door? Splish splash. Yeah. We're doing this.

950
04:43:23,740 --> 04:43:49,860
Maybe not. Can I not go in there? You died very quickly. Purple is for purple alien. That's right.

951
04:43:53,130 --> 04:43:56,169
You catch sight of the giant shadow moving through the water. Looks like

952
04:43:56,810 --> 04:44:02,169
Gregorio's waterway has a lord reigning over its murky channels. Find out what it is and catch it

953
04:44:02,169 --> 04:44:20,520
for me. Lord of the waterway. That sounds fun. In the water? That scared the shit out of me. Oh my

954
04:44:20,520 --> 04:44:31,619
God. Why? I thought it was, I thought it grabbed me. I thought it was still alive and grabbed my

955
04:44:31,619 --> 04:44:54,419
leg or something. Waterway. Cool. Okay. Seven. You've proven yourself reliable. Got some rare

956
04:44:54,419 --> 04:45:02,889
things on sale, stranger. He's killing me. Why is this small key two and this small key six?

957
04:45:04,169 --> 04:45:21,860
What's up with this scam here? That's kind of a scam. I think one of the cheap ones.

958
04:45:22,020 --> 04:45:32,439
Wise choice. I know green herbs, red herbs. I mean, this thing's cool.

959
04:45:35,130 --> 04:45:41,619
You can't go wrong with that. That'd be all pleasant. Oh my God. This is a mess.

960
04:45:45,139 --> 04:46:00,840
Ooh, I got three blues. Go. Hey, I need all two purples. Hey, two math glasses.

961
04:46:01,479 --> 04:46:21,189
And then I need blue, purple and gray. I can buy them. Can I welcome came into some other bits

962
04:46:21,189 --> 04:46:31,639
in Bob's two names. Good instinct. Stranger. This ain't a charity. Why is he screaming at me? I'll

963
04:46:31,639 --> 04:47:01,270
keep a lookout. I mean that it's, I could, I could do it. Although I don't, I should do every color.

964
04:47:01,349 --> 04:47:13,139
That's for a hundred K. Yeah. I'll sell the other ones or wait. I got purple, green,

965
04:47:13,139 --> 04:47:41,240
red. Hold on a second. Purple, red, green, blue, yellow. Ah, and I can say I'll save these.

966
04:47:41,240 --> 04:47:47,180
Actually, you know what? I don't need to have to be double make the money. Only two chapters left.

967
04:47:47,819 --> 04:48:04,549
As we'll just do it. I have a lot of money now for items that welcome burger King Barry

968
04:48:05,430 --> 04:48:16,500
140,000. I got a lot of money now. This is an insane amount of money.

969
04:48:19,290 --> 04:48:27,340
Thank you. So what now? I power. Ooh, stingray. What is that? A rifle? You'll get some bang for

970
04:48:27,419 --> 04:48:40,279
your buck. I T a well-tuned increased power by one and a half times. Oh shit.

971
04:48:44,490 --> 04:48:51,430
We're starting to get an idea of yours. You've exhausted our normal range of services. This

972
04:48:51,430 --> 04:48:57,909
thing is unbeatable now. If you're interested in something, okay. 60,000. You catch my drift.

973
04:48:57,909 --> 04:49:05,659
Should I just go for it? Your weapons. I need to do. I need a ticket. I think I need to see.

974
04:49:12,009 --> 04:49:21,029
Oh, let us know when you've made some room. Okay. I have, what are you? What is happening?

975
04:49:24,119 --> 04:49:52,659
What the hell are you doing? Docking up while you come back. Just make it all. Just make a ton

976
04:49:52,659 --> 04:50:09,000
of machine gun ammo. Okay. That's pretty good. What do I got now? I don't eat the fish who heals

977
04:50:09,639 --> 04:50:19,930
a bunch of ammo. Well, I've got something new for you. Ruby's all rubbish. She makes no difference.

978
04:50:19,930 --> 04:50:26,919
I don't want to do that. Wait, is this an outfit charm? Oh, I thought that was an,

979
04:50:26,919 --> 04:50:33,400
a new ADA outfit. I was like, Oh wait, this is a new outfit. Then we can talk.

980
04:50:35,720 --> 04:50:39,959
You don't need to take it. Yeah. I don't want to be just completely broke though.

981
04:50:40,040 --> 04:50:47,959
Got something new for you, but whatever you do, it won't do you much good. A deal. Well struck.

982
04:50:52,069 --> 04:50:59,830
The thing is disgusting. It's a veritable work of art. Will that be all then? I think that's all

983
04:50:59,830 --> 04:51:20,119
I want to do. Yes. Thank you. Do check out 70 shots. So we read the charm description. Well,

984
04:51:20,759 --> 04:51:26,279
came into some other bits and bobs to rip shields away from certain enemies using the grapple gun.

985
04:51:26,279 --> 04:51:33,610
That's great. He's killing me next time. Okay. Well this is what I need. So I'm good. All right.

986
04:51:33,610 --> 04:51:39,529
Now let's fight the giant monster in the water. Imagine it's just, it's just right here. Let's

987
04:51:39,529 --> 04:52:02,020
kill this thing. Can I get down there? No. Okay. Let's go. So where is progress now down? You know

988
04:52:02,020 --> 04:52:16,569
what? I'm going to open that. I have a key. You know, pop it open every time it explodes. I think

989
04:52:16,569 --> 04:53:14,729
it grabs me. You dick. You die in the water. Shit. What chair does he have? Probably some CEO chair,

990
04:53:14,729 --> 04:53:35,340
like Herman Miller or something. This is a breastfeeding chair. This is it. This is a

991
04:53:35,340 --> 04:53:50,299
nursing chair. And I wish I I'm not making that up. This is a nursing chair, but it was perfect.

992
04:53:50,299 --> 04:54:07,270
And I had to have it. It was fucking perfect. It's just like, this thing is great. It's,

993
04:54:07,270 --> 04:54:21,430
it works well. It can be a regular chair. It's just a chair. Who cares? Congrats.

994
04:54:32,569 --> 04:54:54,729
Ooh, wait, I can fight the thing. I got a gold bar. I want to fight the thing.

995
04:54:57,959 --> 04:55:03,209
Okay. Wait, you have new stuff. What do you mean?

996
04:55:05,380 --> 04:55:10,659
Got some rare things on sale, stranger. A deal well struck.

997
04:55:11,779 --> 04:55:13,220
Oh, you already had this. You had this.

998
04:55:13,220 --> 04:55:16,020
What can I do you for? Don't get yourself killed.

999
04:55:23,430 --> 04:55:34,680
Oh, chat. Is chat taking it too far? Is chat taking it too far? Settle down. It's a chair.

1000
04:55:37,659 --> 04:55:43,000
It's a funny little thing, but relax. Don't have to take it too far.

1001
04:55:43,799 --> 04:55:54,279
I agree, but we can all agree. It's a, it's a slightly humorous thing. Don't be weird about it.

1002
04:55:54,840 --> 04:56:16,090
Or you're going to get fucking zapped. Okay. My God. Is that him? Right? Is it,

1003
04:56:16,090 --> 04:57:22,439
this is the, is this the big guy? Oh shit. Where's the big guy? Wait, where's this diamond?

1004
04:57:22,439 --> 04:57:33,619
I don't see it. That's gross. Don't make me regret saying that. It's funny, but come on guys,

1005
04:57:33,619 --> 04:58:09,020
relax. Don't make it weird. Don't make it weird. What made you choose this chair over the others?

1006
04:58:11,349 --> 04:58:18,259
Okay. Here's the next part of this, which is why it's funny. It's one of the only chairs

1007
04:58:18,259 --> 04:58:31,770
at target. There are two chairs at target. This is one of them. They may be more,

1008
04:58:31,770 --> 04:58:49,959
there may be one to three chairs in your target. It's the target chair. I love target. Yeah.

1009
04:58:51,139 --> 04:58:56,389
Uh, it's also temporary. So, uh, I think I said at the beginning of the stream that

1010
04:58:56,389 --> 04:59:04,360
that's a big one right there. Yep. Uh, I'm getting a different chair to be here.

1011
04:59:05,080 --> 04:59:09,740
This is very temporary. Uh, and I'm just going to use it as a regular chair after

1012
04:59:10,459 --> 04:59:29,419
the other chair is just not here. It will be soon. You're going to betray this recliner.

1013
04:59:29,419 --> 04:59:31,979
It's actually, believe it or not, this is actually pretty comfortable.

1014
04:59:32,540 --> 04:59:42,630
I like it. It's just like, it doesn't, it just rocks. Uh, I want to turn that in.

1015
05:00:18,580 --> 05:00:19,459
What should I get now?

1016
05:00:27,060 --> 05:00:33,369
I think, I think I just saved my money. Is the charm of the charms worth it?

1017
05:00:35,700 --> 05:00:54,040
Actually it, yeah, it definitely is. Yeah. It's only five. Hard to find a nice desk chair these

1018
05:00:54,040 --> 05:00:58,919
days. And those gaming chairs are actually the most uncomfortable. This nursing, whatever,

1019
05:00:58,919 --> 05:01:05,080
like baby chair, whatever this actually is. Uh, it's just a great chair and use it for whatever

1020
05:01:05,080 --> 05:01:11,500
you want. Like me, you, it's, it actually is crazy. Let's get, let's get real for a second.

1021
05:01:13,380 --> 05:01:18,020
Finding furniture that I did when you just want like a small thing to sit in,

1022
05:01:18,020 --> 05:01:22,580
just like a little thing. It's kind of hard to find something like this. This kind of stuff

1023
05:01:22,580 --> 05:01:30,419
doesn't really exist. It's either like a giant fucking huge thing or it's part of a big couch

1024
05:01:30,419 --> 05:01:34,979
or it's a curved up here. It's made out of materially. It's just, it's just uncomfortable.

1025
05:01:35,540 --> 05:01:42,330
And it's, it's, somebody just said it's really expensive. So I, this is exactly what I wanted

1026
05:01:42,330 --> 05:01:52,500
it for. Everything is huge now. Yeah. And now is it like the best chair in the world? No. I mean,

1027
05:01:53,459 --> 05:01:58,979
I want to say this was, I mean, it wasn't cheap, cheap, cheap. I mean, it was still,

1028
05:01:58,979 --> 05:02:01,299
it was like, I think a couple hundred bucks, a hundred something bucks, I think.

1029
05:02:03,220 --> 05:02:07,779
But you get a chair that's like a nice chair like this. You might have to spend 500 to a thousand

1030
05:02:07,779 --> 05:02:14,970
dollars, which is, I just, I got one coming. That's going to be a little bit better, but

1031
05:02:19,959 --> 05:02:29,479
yeah. Some of these chairs are like over five plus a hundred thousand, 100, 100, not 100,000,

1032
05:02:29,479 --> 05:02:38,380
5,000 to like, I've seen chairs that are 5,000. You know, those big, they almost look like,

1033
05:02:38,380 --> 05:02:42,139
okay. You know, the chairs look like cigars. They look like gigantic cigars. It's all like

1034
05:02:42,139 --> 05:02:52,139
the only way I can describe it. The cigar chair. It's like this high off the ground and this wide.

1035
05:02:52,139 --> 05:02:58,150
And it looks like a cigar. Those things are more than one to $2,000 at least.

1036
05:02:58,790 --> 05:03:00,729
Yeah. The Mr. Green's chair. Exactly.

1037
05:03:11,580 --> 05:03:14,220
I think I don't need to, is there any more? There's an upgrade.

1038
05:03:17,540 --> 05:03:37,080
I'll do it later. Okay. So I can pull shields away now, but yeah, I want to say I'll be in

1039
05:03:37,080 --> 05:03:42,459
this chair for the next few streams, maybe the next two or three streams, but I did,

1040
05:03:42,459 --> 05:03:46,139
there is another one that I want, that I want to get. That's a little more elaborate.

1041
05:03:46,139 --> 05:03:51,819
That will help with my legs, but this is going to just kind of sit in the corner over here and

1042
05:03:51,819 --> 05:03:57,900
just be a chair. So this whole setup is temporary. You'll see some changes in the next few weeks.

1043
05:03:59,110 --> 05:04:17,270
I'm excited for it. Auto can sleep in it. Yeah. This would, this would be like a nice

1044
05:04:17,270 --> 05:04:21,509
little auto chair probably. Although it'd be hard for him to get up on top of it.

1045
05:04:22,229 --> 05:04:31,110
It'd be hard for him to get in and lie down on it. I'd have to pick him up and he might be able

1046
05:04:31,110 --> 05:04:45,849
to sit with me in the other one. That'd be kind of cute. Is he doing all right? Yeah, he's doing

1047
05:04:45,849 --> 05:04:54,310
great. He's doing wonderful. Oh, you bet. You better believe there'll be, I'll be hanging out

1048
05:04:54,310 --> 05:04:57,509
here with him sitting either right on my lap or right because the other chair I'm getting is a

1049
05:04:57,509 --> 05:05:06,340
lot bigger. They'd be right in the face. It's not quite a cigar chair, but it's a little bit wider

1050
05:05:06,340 --> 05:05:34,099
than this one. Well, I got the treasure I wanted. Where is it? Oh, it's hanging. Alrighty. We need

1051
05:05:34,099 --> 05:05:55,669
to go down there. Wait, I could climb up. Yeah. Wait a minute. Is it worth getting down and is

1052
05:05:55,669 --> 05:06:01,130
that open? I need a red robe. I actually thought about streaming with a robot and that'd be fun.

1053
05:06:01,770 --> 05:06:09,479
Shit. I can't open this. Okay. I gotta, I gotta lock in here. How did I even get back up here?

1054
05:06:09,479 --> 05:06:28,380
I'm just kind of talking. All right. I want to go this way. Yeah. You look like Hugh Hefner.

1055
05:06:29,099 --> 05:06:57,750
Please do one grapple melee. Yeah. I don't know. If it's just melee from a distance,

1056
05:06:57,750 --> 05:07:00,549
it doesn't seem to be working unless it's a different button combination that I'm not doing.

1057
05:07:01,669 --> 05:07:19,020
Where are you? You're gonna make me eat my egg or my fish or whatever it is.

1058
05:07:19,580 --> 05:07:39,319
You need to be far away and then hit it. I'll try it again, but I feel like I've been

1059
05:07:40,119 --> 05:08:03,560
too far away almost. Can I sneak in here? Remember guys, if there's not a button on the screen,

1060
05:08:03,560 --> 05:08:07,400
he can't see it and he won't know. Well, that's not true because even if there is a button on the

1061
05:08:07,400 --> 05:08:14,380
screen that says rotate with Q and E, I apparently won't see that either. So I'm kind of just lost

1062
05:08:14,380 --> 05:08:34,659
regardless. So I don't know if I can be helped. Oh, I'm so concerned about that person.

1063
05:08:37,700 --> 05:08:45,270
Holy shit. That was cool. That dude over there. That wasn't that far. That wasn't far away.

1064
05:08:48,869 --> 05:08:54,599
This person over here is, how are they still confused? Why are they not breaking out?

1065
05:09:16,259 --> 05:09:48,599
Oh, thank God. He took like two. Yeah. Why did he die so quickly? He died incredibly fast.

1066
05:09:48,599 --> 05:10:12,840
Was it the flashbang? The gun is just so upgraded. Then I'm start using it more often.

1067
05:10:12,840 --> 05:10:55,220
Did I get everything? Maybe. Make some more ammo. I think I can do it. Yeah. He just melted when I

1068
05:10:55,220 --> 05:11:16,069
shot him with this like two times. That was awesome. I think it's filthy. Use the charm for

1069
05:11:16,069 --> 05:11:43,139
extra SMG ammo. I think I have it on. Isn't it on? I think that's it right there. Cool chair.

1070
05:11:43,139 --> 05:11:51,779
It is a cool chair. It doesn't matter where it's from. It's a cool chair. 35,000. All right. What

1071
05:11:51,779 --> 05:11:56,409
do I want to do here? I want that. So I'm going to sell. Oh, well, there you go.

1072
05:11:57,049 --> 05:12:12,419
A deal well struck. Fool stranger. Melee crit. That sounds good. Now going for some mayhem,

1073
05:12:12,419 --> 05:12:18,819
eh? What if it is from target? Yeah, it doesn't matter. Chair is a chair. And if it's a decent

1074
05:12:18,819 --> 05:12:27,060
chair, it's a decent chair. Honestly, even when the new chair, when I get the new one,

1075
05:12:27,939 --> 05:12:31,930
who knows? I might sit in the new one and go, put me back in the other one.

1076
05:12:34,490 --> 05:12:37,369
It's what if it's not the same? What if I really just like this one?

1077
05:12:38,009 --> 05:12:52,709
Here's the second. We possibly save it again. Current one looks comfy. It is. It just does

1078
05:12:52,709 --> 05:13:01,340
exactly what I want it to do. Be a chair that can swivel. It can rock. It's fairly comfortable.

1079
05:13:01,979 --> 05:13:07,900
I will. Okay. I will say the material, this material is a little grainy. It's a little

1080
05:13:07,900 --> 05:13:26,900
rough, but it's not bad. It's fine. It's comfortable. No foot rest. No.

1081
05:13:29,659 --> 05:14:06,040
What is a man without his baby chair? True. It's a real man-sized chair. Let's kill this

1082
05:14:06,040 --> 05:14:22,659
guy once and for all. Definitely got him. What? The thing crashed from the ceiling,

1083
05:14:22,659 --> 05:14:27,299
landed right on his head. It didn't kill him? That would have killed any man or living being

1084
05:14:27,299 --> 05:15:35,509
or thing. Oh God. Oh, let go. Let go. Let go. Oh, not yet. Okay. Now I take it. Oh, that hurts.

1085
05:15:45,540 --> 05:15:50,419
This gun is so unbelievable. I could make the difficulty harder if I wanted to.

1086
05:15:51,819 --> 05:16:26,380
Holy shit. This thing is maxed out. Well, I'm still going to use it. Give me all the

1087
05:16:26,380 --> 05:16:45,020
stuff first before I lose access to all of it. You got to shoot it in the, in the orange goo.

1088
05:16:45,020 --> 05:18:03,669
Ouch. I think I got all the stuff. Oh, okay. This would be it. Almost out of bullets. One more time

1089
05:18:03,669 --> 05:18:55,799
maybe. Yeah, that's it. I thought I got, oh, that cure does not work currently. Don't tell me I'm

1090
05:18:55,799 --> 05:19:05,799
not good at a game when I did. Look what I just did. That's like one, two, three. Like, holy shit,

1091
05:19:05,799 --> 05:19:12,680
dude. Yeah. I mean, I'm seeing like a lot of people saying like, holy shit. I actually like,

1092
05:19:12,680 --> 05:19:17,909
I had it wrong. He's like really fucking good. I, sometimes I like to prove people wrong.

1093
05:19:43,900 --> 05:19:51,139
I like this area. The amber Louise, where is it? He's weird. Mushrooms.

1094
05:19:51,139 --> 05:20:28,119
Ada does not give a, Ada does not give a heck. Yeah, I know. It's part of her character.

1095
05:20:28,119 --> 05:20:50,970
Close one. Yeah. Thanks for that. You guys keeping me honest for it. I don't want to say

1096
05:20:54,250 --> 05:20:56,409
right. I don't want to say that.

1097
05:20:56,970 --> 05:21:43,849
Yeah. No, I'm just, I didn't say anything. Mom, are you reading chat Leon? There's only time to

1098
05:21:43,849 --> 05:21:51,509
say this once. They said it was a joke. If you hurry. Wait, if my mom was watching, wouldn't

1099
05:21:51,509 --> 05:22:20,040
she see the face cam? She would see the face cam. Sorry, ma. Okay. Uh, one or what? Two chapters

1100
05:22:20,040 --> 05:22:27,349
left. Okay. The last chapter is probably a runaway from the big, scary monster. So there's

1101
05:22:27,349 --> 05:22:46,900
probably one real chapter remaining, but it's all good. I'm ready to go. Let's do it. I would,

1102
05:22:46,900 --> 05:23:29,020
that was really lazy. I just needed to walk two more steps. That was okay. Storm trooper aim. I

1103
05:23:29,020 --> 05:23:59,689
got it in two hits. All right. Wait a minute. Trying to do the grapple hook thing. End up

1104
05:23:59,689 --> 05:24:21,659
running at them and not far enough. Really? How do you stagger from that far away? Okay. Well,

1105
05:24:21,659 --> 05:24:29,619
I have to get down there fast. Can I grapple hook down there? I'm just gonna wait for them to get

1106
05:24:29,619 --> 05:25:00,490
up here. Let's kill them. Then go grapple gun, melee attack type. Why is this showing me a

1107
05:25:00,490 --> 05:25:30,069
controller? But it's an F already bound to cause I changed the controls to have. Okay. So here's

1108
05:25:30,069 --> 05:25:35,990
what's happening. So I rebound my melee to thumb button. I thought it was telling me just to hit

1109
05:25:35,990 --> 05:25:42,779
the melee button, not F like, Oh, Hey, hit F, but also hit thumb button because that's what you

1110
05:25:42,779 --> 05:25:52,060
haven't found to because sometimes it like changes. Yeah. Okay. Well it's a, I thought they were the

1111
05:25:52,060 --> 05:26:13,020
same button. Okay. Let's go now. Turn it again. I collected the money. Yeah. For some reason I

1112
05:26:13,020 --> 05:26:20,139
thought it was just melee from far away. And even though I did see F, F to me was the same

1113
05:26:20,700 --> 05:26:30,090
binding of the same key, which is thumb button. So that's on me. I don't even need it.

1114
05:26:37,900 --> 05:26:38,939
What do I do with my money now?

1115
05:26:52,860 --> 05:27:05,080
I think I was going to buy gunpowder because come on, I'll buy gunpowder.

1116
05:27:05,479 --> 05:27:18,330
And soon. Well, it's good work. If I do say so myself, I can do that too.

1117
05:27:19,130 --> 05:27:31,700
A deal. Well struck. Uh, attack speed by one and a half times for the knife tuned weapon can make

1118
05:27:31,700 --> 05:27:41,779
up for a lack of skill friend dazzled. I like durability more. Our craftsmanship demands.

1119
05:27:42,419 --> 05:27:51,159
Ruby's all rubbish. It makes no difference. The price is going to be for generators.

1120
05:27:51,159 --> 05:28:05,459
So I'm going to keep the scope. There's some things money. An interesting choice.

1121
05:28:05,459 --> 05:28:22,060
I'll keep a lookout as well. All right. Welcome stranger. What can I do you for a deal? Well,

1122
05:28:23,020 --> 05:28:33,639
Hey, there you are. Hey, older Billy on the knife. Thank you. Equip your charm.

1123
05:28:34,200 --> 05:28:48,790
Didn't I? I think I had it right. Do check out my welcome. Life needs care every once in a while.

1124
05:28:52,840 --> 05:29:04,819
It's not on there. Welcome. Isn't that it right there? Where's that screen to equip stuff?

1125
05:29:05,459 --> 05:29:21,939
Like, how do I get to that menu screen? Oh, it's typewriter beat three novice star doors,

1126
05:29:22,659 --> 05:29:55,139
giant insects. I'll try. Yeah, that's on Nova star doors. It was a really bad dry. I'll say,

1127
05:29:59,189 --> 05:30:35,419
okay. This way. And then treasure. And then down that way. Don't be spotted. I upgraded the knife.

1128
05:30:35,419 --> 05:31:16,169
Might as well use it. Saved ammo. All right, let's try it. How do I do it? Got it. Treasure

1129
05:31:16,250 --> 05:32:10,310
is straight through here. Cool. Backflip flip. Cool. Flip. You suck. Oh shit. I ain't dealing

1130
05:32:10,310 --> 05:32:39,080
with that. Treasure up there. I'm going to play Starfield. I couldn't really get into it. I was

1131
05:32:39,080 --> 05:32:48,740
never a big Bethesda game player. Didn't really get into it. All right, we're down. And then,

1132
05:32:48,740 --> 05:33:06,299
okay, let's do this first. Although to be fair though, I never really loved games where

1133
05:33:07,500 --> 05:33:13,029
it's just a lot of dialogue options and dialogue options that really just it's,

1134
05:33:13,029 --> 05:33:19,049
Hey, here's like four things. You can just talk to this person. I never was a big fan of it.

1135
05:33:20,810 --> 05:33:29,159
It always kind of just leads to the same thing. Now Baldur's Gate has dialogue options, but

1136
05:33:30,200 --> 05:33:35,319
I feel like I'm invested in my character a little more somehow. I feel like it actually means

1137
05:33:35,319 --> 05:33:39,240
things. And somebody just said sorcery too, but a lot of stuff you do in sorcery, like has immediate

1138
05:33:39,240 --> 05:33:44,939
consequences. I feel like a lot of times in the games where you pick a lot of dialogue options,

1139
05:33:44,939 --> 05:33:48,939
it's just like, Hey, you can kind of talk to this person however you want. It doesn't really

1140
05:33:48,939 --> 05:33:52,700
necessarily matter too much, but like you can just have a conversation in the way that you would want

1141
05:33:52,700 --> 05:34:10,619
to. Like that's cool, but never really did it for me. Except one randomly will insult them. Yeah.

1142
05:34:10,619 --> 05:34:17,659
All right. I am going to get crushed by one of these and I'm not careful. I didn't get the

1143
05:34:17,659 --> 05:34:32,919
treasure. Did I miss my opportunity to get it? I don't think I can get back up. Oh, there it is.

1144
05:34:36,740 --> 05:34:49,340
Dialogue actually matters in Baldur's Gate 3. Oh yeah, it really does. Baldur's Gate,

1145
05:34:49,340 --> 05:34:58,979
the consequences are like sorcery. And obviously my attention span is pretty low already. So if

1146
05:34:58,979 --> 05:35:06,979
there's not immediate stakes on something, I kind of lose interest, which is like, Hey, talk to this

1147
05:35:06,979 --> 05:35:11,540
person. You need to go figure this out. It's like, Oh, okay, cool. And it's like, Oh, by the way,

1148
05:35:11,540 --> 05:35:15,979
you're gonna, you can sit here for a while and just talk. It doesn't really mean anything,

1149
05:35:15,979 --> 05:35:50,630
but you can do it. I always just skip it completely. You piece of shit. Where is it?

1150
05:35:51,270 --> 05:36:13,500
Oh, it's right there. I thought I was not even close guys. I thought I was naughty. I thought

1151
05:36:13,500 --> 05:36:22,330
I was in a perfect safe zone. Holy shit. I may have dumped my pants a little. I think I may have

1152
05:36:22,330 --> 05:36:37,159
dumped the chair. Okay. What the hell? Now I got to go all the way around. He's having another

1153
05:36:37,159 --> 05:36:47,130
brownout. Just don't, don't use any of these for thumbnails. I know you want to. Don't use

1154
05:36:47,130 --> 05:37:19,860
something else. Use me going like this. Okay. Try it again. Yeah, it sucks. It's a long run,

1155
05:37:19,860 --> 05:37:25,240
isn't it? Yeah. I feel, I can hear you're out of breath. Don't have the strength to attack,

1156
05:37:25,240 --> 05:37:49,000
do you? I was going to give you a minute. It's a long ass run. Now go back the way we came.

1157
05:37:49,000 --> 05:38:19,139
I can actually go up here, can't I? Let's not make the same mistake twice. I made the same

1158
05:38:19,139 --> 05:38:51,180
mistake twice. If those of you keeping score at home on your scoreboard, we're good. Who shot that?

1159
05:39:03,560 --> 05:39:27,610
Do it. And you missed completely. And now you got your leg hit. What was that all about? I got a

1160
05:39:27,610 --> 05:39:51,459
lot of herbs. I don't actually stop using my, um, my rifle because of the generators. How do I pull

1161
05:39:51,459 --> 05:40:42,580
it off? It looked like I had it. There we go. You're alive. I thought you were dead. Okay. Now

1162
05:40:42,580 --> 05:41:42,819
what? Into the ancient Chantry. I hear, I hear Laurel, to be honest. Do not shoot that. Grapple

1163
05:41:42,819 --> 05:41:46,580
melee doesn't make any sense. Why wouldn't they just come towards the player? Kind of like a

1164
05:41:46,580 --> 05:41:56,819
scorpion. Yeah. Well, I think, yeah. Unless they weigh a thousand pounds. It's just so unrealistic.

1165
05:41:57,860 --> 05:42:26,310
I'm surprised we're still in chapter five. I figured we would've got out of it by now.

1166
05:42:43,060 --> 05:42:47,779
Somebody told Leon that that hat gives him like plus 20% speed. And they were just lying to him.

1167
05:42:48,340 --> 05:43:14,470
That's the only reason why he's got it on. And Mr. Kennedy, why do you have that stupid hat on?

1168
05:43:15,029 --> 05:43:20,810
I don't think it's stupid, but it's stupid for the occasion. You're an idiot. It gives me plus

1169
05:43:20,810 --> 05:43:43,060
5% damage. Krauser has possession of the Amber. Don't ever do that voice again. Keep the client

1170
05:43:43,060 --> 05:44:37,909
happy. Sorry. Oh, do you? Okay. There's a show that is a scorn like, have you guys ever seen

1171
05:44:37,909 --> 05:44:47,720
Ballmasters Adult Swim? They do the scorn randomly throughout that show. You just hear

1172
05:44:48,599 --> 05:44:55,959
Ballmasters. They'll be in the middle of a game and it's like, Oh, big play happens. Ballmasters.

1173
05:44:56,840 --> 05:45:02,950
It's they do scorn. I was like, Holy shit. That's awesome. They actually,

1174
05:45:02,950 --> 05:45:10,520
it's actually a scorn. Like I've been waiting for somebody to do that for years. And I guess

1175
05:45:10,520 --> 05:45:20,360
somebody did it. That's a crazy show, by the way. That show is very alive. There's a lot happening

1176
05:45:20,360 --> 05:46:12,389
in that show. You didn't even play scorn. You smoking crack? Stop it. This is a great setup.

1177
05:46:17,689 --> 05:46:24,360
A motorcycle. It's a boat, dude. I need to eat a fucking jar of peanut butter after this. I thought

1178
05:46:24,360 --> 05:46:37,020
he took off on a motorcycle. God. I just hear like, Oh dude, cool. I want to see what like

1179
05:46:37,020 --> 05:46:59,939
fucking sick variety he's got. Looking for something? Chapter complete. Why peanut butter?

1180
05:46:59,939 --> 05:47:22,330
It's got protein and good fats and all that stuff. Peanut butter or hummus. Eat them both.

1181
05:47:23,209 --> 05:47:35,770
Not at the same time, but the hat flies off and he's just like, Oh shit. You look like you've got

1182
05:47:35,849 --> 05:47:42,490
something to say. I have something to ask you, but I don't think I'll get a straight answer.

1183
05:47:43,290 --> 05:47:51,930
Fucking stinks in that hat. Just telling you. Raccoon City. He's been wearing it for like six

1184
05:47:51,930 --> 05:48:01,380
days. The world changed. You try to save one person, a hundred others die. I guess I changed

1185
05:48:01,380 --> 05:48:21,060
too. You? Leon S. Kennedy. You haven't changed. You just think you have. So here's my question.

1186
05:48:23,909 --> 05:48:35,209
Have you changed Ada or are you just trying to use me again? What do you think? We're here.

1187
05:48:40,069 --> 05:48:52,970
Don't think too hard, handsome. See you later. Story of my life. All right. See you later,

1188
05:48:52,970 --> 05:49:14,020
Leon. Look at the improv show. You're about to go act in. Good one. Yes. Yes. That was a good

1189
05:49:14,020 --> 05:49:37,529
one. I think it was too. That one stinks. What's your opinion? I don't even have this rifle.

1190
05:49:38,090 --> 05:49:45,740
Whose blood are you here for this time? Mine or Sadler's? That all depends on you.

1191
05:49:45,740 --> 05:49:52,459
That's a sick weapon too. I don't even have it. Change of plans. Of course.

1192
05:49:53,669 --> 05:50:00,599
I wish I could put them all in that fucking hat. Friend's going to be enough. Interesting.

1193
05:50:05,259 --> 05:50:15,180
Okay. I'll do it. But cost you extra. Wise decision. Send you the new coordinates.

1194
05:50:16,139 --> 05:50:24,009
And remember, I do not like waiting. I know. I was going to say dialogue options.

1195
05:50:24,569 --> 05:50:43,430
So just get right to the point. God damn it. I've got a ways to go.

1196
05:50:49,880 --> 05:51:25,669
Head for the comms facility. Okay. So this is the island, right? Yeah. Okay. Treasures. Nice.

1197
05:51:36,599 --> 05:51:50,889
That just opened. Okay. You don't have to fight. Oh, Leon fights him, right? Crystal ore.

1198
05:51:51,610 --> 05:52:43,319
Stab him. Stab him. Stab him. Stab him. Why are you reloading the guns? Too close. We're good.

1199
05:52:43,319 --> 05:52:50,779
You're going to S plus all characters on perks? Uh, no, I did S plus on a few places and a few

1200
05:52:50,779 --> 05:52:56,459
people. Um, I wouldn't do that tonight though. I'm going to get to the end of the game and probably

1201
05:52:56,459 --> 05:53:04,759
call it. And then I think Monday is the next time I'm going to be streaming. Monday I might be in a

1202
05:53:04,759 --> 05:53:10,779
new setup. Well, an upgraded version of the one you see right now. I want to play party animals

1203
05:53:10,779 --> 05:53:17,020
again. I think stir wants to play it too. I also asked Vinny if he wanted to play as well. So we'll

1204
05:53:17,020 --> 05:53:49,209
probably get a crew together, play a little bit of party animals. That's fun. Well, okay. Did I

1205
05:53:49,209 --> 05:54:07,830
get everything from this room? No, there is a treasure hanging right here. Oh, I missed the

1206
05:54:07,830 --> 05:54:18,500
amp. Oh, whatever. Be just up ahead, but getting through won't be Ada and Wesker were added to

1207
05:54:18,500 --> 05:54:34,119
marks. Ooh, Wesker was fun. Wesker was a Magnum, right? Welcome came into some other bits and bobs

1208
05:54:34,119 --> 05:54:43,529
too. Why not try your hand running speed? That's kind of cold. All right. Do I, I think I want

1209
05:54:43,529 --> 05:54:54,500
flash grenades. Flash grenades are the best from what I remember, especially in the end, or should

1210
05:54:54,500 --> 05:55:16,680
I do? I don't know. Or do I just upgrade the hell out of the knife tuned weapon can make up for a

1211
05:55:16,680 --> 05:55:27,979
lack of skill. Why not try that on? That's about 40,000 for one and a half times attack speed.

1212
05:55:28,860 --> 05:55:40,950
I've never done that before. So maybe I could try it. Ruby's all rubbish. It makes no difference.

1213
05:55:40,950 --> 05:55:47,619
The price. Well, that's our choice to make. There's some things money. I'm going to hold

1214
05:55:47,619 --> 05:55:56,009
on to everything else. Anything else I can help you with 40,000. It's okay for now.

1215
05:55:57,689 --> 05:56:13,270
Check out my wares again. Great rifles. Probably the best at this point. Yeah. I mean,

1216
05:56:13,270 --> 05:56:31,959
there's a whole, I got one more chapter for this. So I want some max health, but it's sell those.

1217
05:56:34,409 --> 05:56:40,279
I'm not going to use them. These are so expensive.

1218
05:56:41,240 --> 05:56:44,840
A deal. Well, pleasant. And maybe I will just buy the rocket launcher

1219
05:56:48,900 --> 05:57:00,389
have like a super explosive thing at the end. All right. Handgun ammo is starting to get a

1220
05:57:00,389 --> 05:57:16,299
little low. You're going to regret that bolt action with the regenerators. That's why I'm

1221
05:57:16,299 --> 05:57:26,060
holding on to the rifle because, Oh my goodness. Bebop. No rock steady. I forget which one

1222
05:57:35,459 --> 05:58:01,830
hit me right in the forehead. Oh, kill him. Please. Another one. Where is he?

1223
05:58:11,259 --> 05:58:21,930
Oh, he's right behind me. He's not. Oh my God. Oh, that was all explosive bolts.

1224
05:58:22,650 --> 05:58:38,779
He just unloaded an entire magazine of rusty bolts. Hey, somebody said I looked rusty.

1225
05:58:39,419 --> 05:58:54,569
So I said, rusty bolts while I was saying explosive bolts, I saved it, right? Did I

1226
05:58:54,970 --> 05:59:04,259
write that? Did I screw that up? Yeah, we're good. Okay. Well that was kind of crazy.

1227
05:59:04,979 --> 05:59:41,000
Try it again. I think it's so good. All right. I got to go this way now. All right. I'm going

1228
05:59:41,000 --> 06:00:17,259
to blow you up when you land. All right. Where is he? Oh shit. Okay. You're dead. Collect everything.

1229
06:00:17,259 --> 06:00:37,659
Okay. This bunch of money over there. He's actually playing. I thought he just talks.

1230
06:00:39,189 --> 06:00:46,840
Well, we know what happens when I just talk. I, uh, I don't know that. I don't know Q and E rotate

1231
06:00:47,560 --> 06:00:58,169
a puzzle. And I turned my head upside down to see the thing right side up. Oh, look at how,

1232
06:00:58,169 --> 06:01:03,880
look at how pretty this is. This is like a, it's like Christmas. Somebody did all this.

1233
06:01:04,680 --> 06:01:17,220
Look at that. Is it for me? All the decorations. That's so cute. Thanks for me. Wait, treasure.

1234
06:01:17,860 --> 06:01:51,400
I should start using the knife more often. I think that's it. And yes.

1235
06:02:12,459 --> 06:02:18,869
Wait, why doesn't Ash, why doesn't Ashley have different clothes on?

1236
06:02:20,869 --> 06:02:28,259
If he's dressed like such an idiot. Wouldn't I have had her dressed in some

1237
06:02:28,259 --> 06:02:32,900
outfit too? I think she had sunglasses on.

1238
06:02:45,590 --> 06:03:09,619
Here comes the regenerators. Worst thing ever. Okay. I need to make sure I use that very well.

1239
06:03:09,619 --> 06:03:17,299
So we're going to the left. No we're not.

1240
06:03:33,529 --> 06:03:41,270
Sell two ornate beetles. There's one hidden in dissection in facility one.

1241
06:03:41,270 --> 06:03:42,549
And somebody stole the other.

1242
06:03:50,619 --> 06:03:53,580
Oh, just realized how much shit he has in his pockets.

1243
06:03:53,900 --> 06:04:12,220
All right. How much is the rocket launcher? 80. I'm going to hold. Hold my money.

1244
06:04:16,889 --> 06:04:30,680
Doing that for the regenerators only. What has he got in his pockets?

1245
06:04:30,680 --> 06:04:44,020
It's kinds of stuff. I need to get to the comms facility. It needs some power though.

1246
06:04:44,020 --> 06:05:03,750
What does he, what's in his pockets? I'm available. All right. Regenerators. I'm ready.

1247
06:05:09,349 --> 06:05:37,849
Don't have an automatic door. Yeah. The parasites watch out. They regenerate in.

1248
06:05:38,569 --> 06:06:31,500
Definitely. But it's okay. I'm hiding. Holy shit. Oh, a beetle. I'm not messing around.

1249
06:06:36,869 --> 06:07:13,130
Treasure in here? Where is it? Above? Hmm. No, nevermind. Okay. I am ready.

1250
06:07:40,330 --> 06:07:43,659
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. They run. They run. They run. It's running at me.

1251
06:07:43,659 --> 06:08:30,069
The book was way better. Is that back? It is. She played Venga bus, but really faded.

1252
06:08:30,069 --> 06:08:38,970
Like she's hearing Leon listen to it in the other room. I feel like that's the thing for post.

1253
06:08:38,970 --> 06:08:42,069
That's funny though. I'll give you, I'm going to give you a plus two for that one.

1254
06:08:42,630 --> 06:09:47,900
All right. Fine. That's fun. I'm doing it. Venga boys. You guys hear something?

1255
06:09:47,900 --> 06:10:17,270
Ow. Coming from the wall. It sounds like that's coming from below my feet.

1256
06:10:17,270 --> 06:11:23,639
This just sounds like it's coming out of her air pods. I just want to do this for a second.

1257
06:11:23,639 --> 06:11:26,840
Like, dude, he's fucking somebody. He's sleeping. Somebody wake him up.

1258
06:11:26,840 --> 06:11:39,700
Oh my God, man. I'm playing Resident Evil all fucking day. I'm tired, man,

1259
06:11:39,700 --> 06:12:16,819
but I got a playlist going. I sorry. I just wanted to make sure that

1260
06:12:16,819 --> 06:12:27,799
you had to deal with the muted audio in the VOD as well. Okay. Where are we going?

1261
06:12:27,799 --> 06:13:29,029
No, I got to go into the freezer. There is. That was bound to happen.

1262
06:13:29,029 --> 06:14:42,409
What the fuck? Oh goodness. I want that beetle. Jeez. Okay. I want that other beetle.

1263
06:15:10,840 --> 06:15:37,669
Hmm. Blood. What was this thing? Oh, there it is. Okay. I got both beetles.

1264
06:15:37,669 --> 06:16:25,770
Okay. Very cool. Now I got to get back down here. Science, math, English, reading,

1265
06:16:25,770 --> 06:16:50,330
arithmetic. He's in here somewhere. I don't know where though. Rotisserie chickens.

1266
06:16:55,860 --> 06:17:01,849
Why is there a rotisserie chicken down here in the, wait, okay. This is like the kitchen, I guess.

1267
06:17:02,409 --> 06:18:05,590
Wait, holy shit. Damn it. It just sounds like when Otto is sleeping.

1268
06:18:05,590 --> 06:18:39,540
I hit him. I didn't hit him in one parasite. What the fuck are you talking about? What the hell?

1269
06:18:49,659 --> 06:19:20,919
Why can I not hit this one? This one's been so finicky. That was very creepy.

1270
06:19:21,479 --> 06:20:04,790
Oh, you can't come through here. Would you guys rather fight one regenerator

1271
06:20:04,790 --> 06:20:09,270
with a grenade or fight two 100 duck-sized horses?

1272
06:20:12,459 --> 06:20:38,279
Oh, you motherfucker. Where are you? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't

1273
06:20:38,279 --> 06:20:46,840
know. I don't know. I don't know. I mean, I don't know. How big is the grenade? First of all,

1274
06:20:46,840 --> 06:20:54,630
and do the duck-sized horses, do they, um, are they angry? Or that's a hard question.

1275
06:20:54,630 --> 06:21:30,200
Where is he now? That's the sound I would imagine that a big duck-sized horse would

1276
06:21:30,200 --> 06:21:35,799
make. So if they're going to make sounds like that, then boy, oh boy, I would want to be really

1277
06:21:35,799 --> 06:21:45,720
prepared for them because that's, that's tricky because they might get really loud in your ears

1278
06:21:45,720 --> 06:22:16,360
and die already. You're going to fall back in the recliner. Yeah. Like that'd be kind of funny

1279
06:22:16,360 --> 06:22:25,959
one day if I just threw back till I have like my both my feet be in the air. All right. Well,

1280
06:22:25,959 --> 06:22:45,270
that is why I did that. So I'm good now. It's getting late. Do I, um, is chapter seven really

1281
06:22:45,270 --> 06:22:58,790
just kind of an epilogue like fight the boss chapter or is it long? Pretty short. Yeah. Yeah.

1282
06:22:58,790 --> 06:23:14,819
We'll finish it. I imagine I'm getting close to the end of this chapter soon. I need to craft

1283
06:23:14,819 --> 06:24:01,540
some shit. Okay. Unlocked. That's the, where the power is. I got to put, oh wait, power.

1284
06:24:02,259 --> 06:24:18,279
They turn the beetles in, gets things done. Got a selection of good things on sale.

1285
06:24:18,279 --> 06:24:22,819
Stranger, your valuables won't do you much. Well,

1286
06:24:24,819 --> 06:24:29,380
10 spinals. Damn. All right. So what can I do now? We're getting kind of close to the end.

1287
06:24:30,180 --> 06:24:47,540
I can do this. I got pressures that I have on. Ooh, this would be good. Triple.

1288
06:24:50,299 --> 06:24:58,860
Thank you. Welcome. What can I interest you in? I'll buy it at a high price.

1289
06:24:58,860 --> 06:25:03,220
All right. One and a half times the tax speed. I feel like, is that really that big of a deal

1290
06:25:03,779 --> 06:25:09,060
to suit your specific needs? I'm not sure. I really want to spend the money on that.

1291
06:25:11,479 --> 06:25:24,889
Yeah. Striker charm. I could buy the rocket launcher and just store it.

1292
06:25:26,599 --> 06:25:32,569
Yeah, that's what I'm doing. All yours, stranger. Got a selection. Now.

1293
06:25:34,490 --> 06:25:47,610
Just hold on to it. Welcome. Can I buy rockets? Please have this in stock, stranger.

1294
06:25:53,880 --> 06:26:01,080
Um, I should probably just do some upgrades to this. Just a handgun. It's a one-time use. All

1295
06:26:01,080 --> 06:26:17,590
right. Maybe I just hold the money. Work. If I do say so myself. I want this information. Yeah.

1296
06:26:20,150 --> 06:26:33,860
Ruby's all rubbish. She makes no difference. Didn't I get a bunch of those arrows?

1297
06:26:33,860 --> 06:26:42,659
Blast arrows? That's our choice. Did I already sell them? I'll hold the money. Thank you.

1298
06:26:42,659 --> 06:26:52,970
Do check out my wares again soon. Get a TV dinner table. I actually think I'm probably

1299
06:26:52,970 --> 06:27:16,950
going to have one. Well, let's do it. I'm going to put it in. There are four people

1300
06:27:16,950 --> 06:27:22,470
fighting in the chat right now. Don't tell them stop. There should be able to get out now.

1301
06:27:23,189 --> 06:27:43,590
I'm going to have to pee one more time for the finale. So I will do that after this.

1302
06:28:00,580 --> 06:28:03,299
Not exactly covert, but it'll have to do.

1303
06:28:07,099 --> 06:28:11,580
Highly sensitive antenna array on the Island is finally complete.

1304
06:28:13,319 --> 06:28:18,299
Browser. Real bastard, isn't it?

1305
06:28:20,819 --> 06:29:04,700
Ow, excuse me. Good one. Well, this isn't good.

1306
06:29:34,659 --> 06:29:41,529
You suck at the gun. Run it back for a second. I don't think I missed one shot that whole ride.

1307
06:29:42,090 --> 06:30:13,349
My favorite carnival. Oh, let's just go ahead and take care of that right now.

1308
06:30:27,720 --> 06:30:49,720
Giant insects. I can't just destroy them or something. Hello.

1309
06:31:01,380 --> 06:31:05,909
I'm going to make a bunch of handgun ammo.

1310
06:31:08,740 --> 06:31:16,060
And I'm going to upgrade the handgun. I'm going to get the Punisher and I'm going to upgrade it.

1311
06:31:17,270 --> 06:31:33,619
You'll get some bang for your buck. I guarantee it. That's a good idea. The red nine is cool,

1312
06:31:33,619 --> 06:31:42,520
but I want to be able to go fast. I did the red nine in the last playthrough. Let's do Punisher.

1313
06:32:05,479 --> 06:32:12,020
Let's go like this. This kind of work is about finesse,

1314
06:32:12,020 --> 06:32:19,299
straight little bit goes a long way. You see anything pleasant travels.

1315
06:32:20,020 --> 06:32:42,299
Where is it? Is it equipped? What am I doing wrong here? Oh, OK. I was like, wait,

1316

1323
06:35:06,729 --> 06:36:08,330
Really? Really? Aim. He's got two. Was he double fisting Molotov cocktails?

subject impervious to conventional weapons now for the bad news it may be

1359

1372
06:53:44,049 --> 06:53:50,819

1374
06:54:46,700 --> 06:55:21,459
difficulty that you can't fail this is it how to connect the device that was

1375
06:55:21,459 --> 06:55:26,540
really easy I just pressed three buttons I just picked random ones I'm really

1376
06:55:26,540 --> 06:55:30,700

1377
06:55:30,700 --> 06:55:35,709
put in a row were to disable the entire security system what a terrible dogshit

1378
06:55:35,709 --> 06:55:39,880
system that is by the way I feel like you could accidentally turn off all

1379
06:55:39,880 --> 06:55:52,779
security including the president's daughter won't that make things harder

1380

1413
07:09:43,860 --> 07:09:48,259
earlier they said it this is seven hours this is abnormal the last six months or

1414
07:09:48,259 --> 07:10:08,779
so it's part of the reason to be in this chair so much better now the frequency of

1415
07:10:08,779 --> 07:10:14,509
the streams is gonna stay the same right but I mean that this is not me telling you that

1416

just much more comfortable than I was before and it's gonna improve it's gonna get better

1418
07:10:23,189 --> 07:10:38,159
I thought there was a stake when it first showed up on the screen but yeah my intention

1419
07:10:38,159 --> 07:10:47,430
is still you know slow it down and everything but I wanted to make sure this last kind of

1420
07:10:47,430 --> 07:10:53,310
arc you want to call it that was a lot more comfortable because I can sit here for whenever

07:26:23,720 --> 07:26:48,979
so we're talking millions of casualties billions how ambitious we're changing course now Wesker

1458
07:26:48,979 --> 07:27:18,900
why like wrong okay that's good it's really fun but it was at seven hours and a half that

1459
07:27:18,900 --> 07:27:24,659
well that's you know take a like hour and 45 minutes away from the puzzles that are good

1460
07:27:24,659 --> 07:27:42,470
but it's total game time five hours five now that was good you're gonna play city skylines

1461
07:27:42,470 --> 07:28:11,950
too oh yeah absolutely I'll say for sure post credits did you play Mortal Kombat just for a

1462
07:28:11,950 --> 07:28:20,669
little bit I tried it out for a few hours I'm just not very good at fighting games fighting

1463
07:28:20,669 --> 07:28:26,650
games are really fun to watch but they're not really fun to play for me fighting games are

1464
07:28:26,650 --> 07:28:32,049
kind of like puzzle games in my brain a series of very specific actions have to happen in a very

1465
07:28:32,049 --> 07:28:56,669
specific order or you lose real-time puzzle games yeah isn't that every video game um well very

1466
07:28:56,790 --> 07:29:15,540
specific actions in the context of you know what I mean when I say that you have to do a very

1467
07:29:15,540 --> 07:29:23,450
specific set of actions to be able to do these moves and to be able to predict what your opponent

1468
07:29:23,450 --> 07:29:31,020
will do this is every video game I saw a lot of trues though you guys know what I mean we're gonna

1469
07:29:31,020 --> 07:29:47,919
read between the lines here real okay so in a puzzle game well you can play a lot of games in

1470
07:29:47,919 --> 07:29:55,680
different ways like I can I can press W and then let go and I'll be fine right like if I just walk

1471
07:29:55,680 --> 07:29:59,520
forward in a fighting game and stop moving it's over I'm gonna get comboed and I'm gonna get

1472
07:29:59,520 --> 07:30:08,229
together I'm dead you have to string together a very specific set of actions in a row it's

1473
07:30:08,229 --> 07:30:13,389
there's no time for you to stop you can't just stop playing you can't just oh I'm gonna go in

1474
07:30:13,389 --> 07:30:20,150
my inventory for a minute nope if you're not doing it down forward slash B walk jump down

1475
07:30:20,150 --> 07:30:26,880
forward B jump back down forward slash B it's like a rhythm game it's like a puzzle rhythm game you

1476
07:30:26,880 --> 07:30:32,880
have to really be paying attention every single millisecond of the time in action everything in a

1477
07:30:32,880 --> 07:30:40,099
row and I don't know I kind of like to be able to blink a few times and not worry about it oh

1478
07:30:40,099 --> 07:30:59,479
I thought this is the post-credits for like six hours I spent an hour and 25 minutes doing

1479
07:30:59,479 --> 07:31:07,779
nothing I love watching fighting games I like watching people play them but the series of very

1480
07:31:07,779 --> 07:31:25,099
specific actions in a row I can't do did he see that wait he got to see that that rating how long

1481
07:31:25,099 --> 07:31:33,259
it took for me to play the game he's watching my stream right now ah he's fucking terrible B six

1482
07:31:33,259 --> 07:31:40,380
hours of game time too I would have figured out that puzzle really quickly he's just watching

1483
07:31:40,380 --> 07:31:47,159
he's just chatting in my chat right now being mean to me when I had a fucking gas leak in my

1484
07:31:47,159 --> 07:32:01,779
room I don't know why I was so bad at that no oh yeah defiance changes nothing besides we have

1485
07:32:01,779 --> 07:32:36,790
all we continue as planned soon son was set on the age of man I feel like if Wesker just took a

1486
07:32:36,790 --> 07:32:45,970
bath he would kind of not give a shit about this anymore a big bubble bath with an iPad I feel like

1487
07:32:45,970 --> 07:32:54,639
you'd be like you know what actually I'm gonna settle down I'm just gonna relax now don't ever

1488
07:32:54,639 --> 07:33:22,540
underestimate what can be solved in a bath okay serious I will try somebody said just even open

1489
07:33:22,540 --> 07:33:35,639
it I'm not gonna try or play but I'll just hop in and check it out the mercenaries I got my points

1490
07:33:35,639 --> 07:34:04,360
costume unlocked lots of costumes my goodness what is by the helicopter guy he's in he's in

1491
07:34:04,360 --> 07:34:29,439
the movie for five minutes oh no no okay it's a model I should wait I want to go back where do I

1492
07:34:29,439 --> 07:35:04,830
do the what do I do the outfits out campaign only okay okay we're gonna go with a rank or above as

1493
07:35:04,869 --> 07:35:32,560
Ada I think I can get that pretty quickly green needle I just want to see Wesker because I'm

1494
07:35:32,560 --> 07:35:43,229
probably not gonna play this again anytime soon really maybe I played in my kind of off time but

1495
07:35:43,229 --> 07:36:13,180
what do I need for a let's get to a and I oh no it's already over that's not what is mayhem a

1496
07:36:13,180 --> 07:36:31,340
motor just like good aiming or just when it kills it when it headshot kills it's like instant reloads

1497
07:36:31,459 --> 07:37:06,549
kind of like Leon's seems pretty good seems pretty good I don't lose the combo all right

1498
07:37:06,549 --> 07:37:59,220
incoming where is he where are you it is good it is really fun to play that's a molotov don't lose

1499
07:37:59,220 --> 07:38:50,659

1500
07:38:50,860 --> 07:39:48,520
right oh no bad I'm gonna get out of the way oh shit don't throw that shit at me right now all

1501
07:39:48,520 --> 07:40:30,759
right I definitely have a I am in trouble but I should be oh I gotta heal uh I'll keep it going

1502
07:40:30,759 --> 07:41:16,020
might as well oh I guess oh shit careful here I need to get the fuck out of the way all right

1503
07:41:16,020 --> 07:41:28,330
326 wow wow wow oh no I got stuck on that guy the guy in front of me was just kind of weirdly

1504
07:41:28,330 --> 07:41:48,270
in the way I think that's a yeah I'll take a nice that's fine all right Wesker and new stage oh

1505
07:41:48,270 --> 07:42:09,959
there's docs all right let's play Wesker so what does he got he's got the Magnum he's got the

1506
07:42:10,159 --> 07:42:33,319
seven okay that's that's goofy don't can I turn into a monster or something what about the other

1507
07:42:33,319 --> 07:42:41,259
gun yeah it's one of these let me see he actually probably is the most fun to play because the

1508
07:42:41,259 --> 07:43:09,939
Magnum all right will you stop that's cool come on through guns kind of slow but it's still fun

1509
07:43:09,939 --> 07:43:58,759
all right mayhem mode what is it oh yeah he does melee attacks all right that's awesome where's

1510
07:43:58,840 --> 07:44:27,250
yeah okay that might be it Jesus let's flip that guy off holy shit I just got a lot of people there

1511
07:44:27,250 --> 07:45:14,740
these bugs are flying around okay I get a better vantage point in this the melee is amazing you

1512
07:45:14,740 --> 07:45:43,810
shithead whoa oh I'm stuck on something in the tunnel oh god I just kicked this guy's ass he

1513
07:45:43,810 --> 07:46:02,979

for watching thanks for hanging out I'll see you guys on Monday for party animals with stir and

1517
07:47:11,250 --> 07:47:22,500
maybe Vinny and then maybe one or two others maybe we'll cycle some people in and out thanks

1518
07:47:22,500 --> 07:47:33,430
for watching uh somebody said to give a rating to separate ways I kind of think it's just part of

1519
07:47:33,430 --> 07:47:43,060
Resident Evil 4 which is a 9.5 to me it's just another few chapters extended onto the game

1520
07:47:43,060 --> 07:47:58,189
Resident Evil 4 is a great game it's just a remake of that it was a little different though I don't

1521
07:47:58,189 --> 07:48:02,150
remember a lot of those encounters in separate ways did I even I don't know if I played second

1522
07:48:02,150 --> 07:48:16,840
boys maybe I did do you like puzzles well the problem is I get like in a feedback loop where I

1523
07:48:16,840 --> 07:48:25,180
get stuck on something and then I try to go as fast I can to fix it and then it makes it even

1524
07:48:25,180 --> 07:48:39,000
worse but I was fine it was fine I can just be kind of a dummy sometimes but it's okay we have

1525
07:48:39,720 --> 07:48:49,020
our weaknesses and one of my weaknesses is shooting at shields on a ball in the correct

1526
07:48:49,020 --> 07:49:04,189
order lies if he is my favorite souls like that isn't from software damn saw X was really good

1527
07:49:04,189 --> 07:49:08,310
too damn okay I'm getting some pretty good recommendations right now of things I thought

1528
07:49:08,310 --> 07:49:20,479
I might want to do but yeah I'll see you guys Monday thanks for watching it's the first almost

1529
07:49:20,479 --> 07:49:29,569
eight hour stream in a long time it's not gonna be the norm but it is possible see you guys on

1530
07:49:29,569 --> 07:49:41,139
Monday take care all your mother you know what to do see you soon
