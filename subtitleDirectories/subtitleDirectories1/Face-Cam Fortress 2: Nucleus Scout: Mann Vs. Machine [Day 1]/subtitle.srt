1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:14,869
Oh, get away from me soldier. I'm doing my introduction. Hey, what is going on everybody Jerma here with face cam

2
00:00:14,869 --> 00:00:20,350
Fortress 2 Monday's edition playing as the Scout on King the Hill nucleus

3
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:26,329
Hold on. I'm just trying to sneak up on him. You got to sneak up on him. Oh

4
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:35,920
He went falling down into hell. Yay. I didn't even tell you the setup. Whoa, this devil man is gonna get me

5
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,280
No, he's not

6
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:43,899
Hmm almost with the direct shot almost got me twice. Did he kill himself? No, he didn't

7
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:50,100
strange scatter gun the Mad Milk and the oh

8
00:00:51,299 --> 00:00:53,299
I would have hit him so easily

9
00:00:53,979 --> 00:00:59,579
And the Sandman I'm being all kinds of weird right now guys. We are we have the point we have the poor

10
00:00:59,899 --> 00:01:04,719
God man, I almost got stuck. You are spy. Whoo

11
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,310
Alright, my heart just exploded. I thought the spy

12
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:14,200
Bumped into me and insta killed me. That was very very weird

13
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:19,109
Oh, but there's something I wanted to bring up in this video. I'm gonna talk about the gray man stuff

14
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:23,189
Not really into that much detail, but still it's it's pretty ridiculous

15
00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:29,629
I can't wait to see what's going on with that if they introduce a new team into team fortress the gray team

16
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:35,560
Can you imagine the lunacy that that is going to accomplish like how much insanity is gonna happen with this game?

17
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:38,920
It's going to be unbelievable. Oh

18
00:01:39,879 --> 00:01:44,799
No, I don't have the ball I just used it Oh nice shot with the ball you ball bag

19
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:54,189
There we are I needed that but there's a lot all kinds of theories going around

20
00:01:54,750 --> 00:02:02,920
My particular theory if you want my theory on the gray man stuff. I think what's gonna happen. It's gonna be bots

21
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:05,900
It's gonna be non player controlled characters

22
00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:11,400
Brand new player models that are not controlled by anybody and there's gonna be a massive amount of them

23
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:16,960
Hey, sorry for barging in like this interrupting face cam fortress 2. Sorry Jerma

24
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:22,199
We'll get back to you in a second, but this literally just came out less than one second ago

25
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:29,439
I rendered this video this face cam fortress video right after talking about the man versus machine stuff and the gray man stuff

26
00:02:29,479 --> 00:02:34,919
This just came out. This is exactly what I was thinking was going to happen guys

27
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:40,080
It is the man versus machine update and it is going to be a brand new game mode

28
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,360
And it's going to be a huge huge huge deal

29
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,539
Now I there's a whole lot of information that I do not know right now

30
00:02:46,539 --> 00:02:50,580
But I just wanted to let you guys know if you head over to the TF2 website TF2 calm

31
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:51,680
It's right on the front page

32
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:59,060
And yes, it is going to be a mode where you fight against waves and waves of a gray robot team

33
00:02:59,099 --> 00:03:06,729
This is ridiculous and and depending on how many missions you complete and how many waves you survive you get probably hats

34
00:03:06,729 --> 00:03:09,270
I think you're gonna be able to get this probably gonna be new weapons

35
00:03:09,349 --> 00:03:14,770
It is going to be unreal and there's also a new movie too. There's a new source filmmaker movie

36
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:16,550
So I just wanted to butt in here for a second

37
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:21,169
I'll let you guys know about this because this is brand new information that I did not see or hear of

38
00:03:21,349 --> 00:03:25,930
Until less than like 30 seconds ago, so we'll get back to face cam fortress 2 now

39
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:28,430
Hopefully man versus machine is going to be incredible

40
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:33,949
You can read all the biographies of all the new enemies all the new robots. There are giants

41
00:03:33,949 --> 00:03:38,870
There are giant robot heavies in this update if you couldn't ask for anything more than that

42
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:42,750
I don't know what else you could ask for but you can see all the information in the links in the description

43
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:48,069
So yeah guys, we'll go back to team fortress face cam fortress 2 and I'll see you guys all soon. Take it away

44
00:03:48,069 --> 00:03:54,759
Gerber so that's my theory if you want it if you want to hear what I have to say

45
00:03:55,639 --> 00:04:04,430
About that same sniper. Oh, I'm coming for you, man. I'm coming for young. You're gonna have a bad day in a second

46
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:15,710
I'm gonna come eat you alive. Is he still there? No, he's not. He's dead. He's dead regardless

47
00:04:16,029 --> 00:04:21,500
I'm gonna go the other way though. But yeah, I think it's gonna be bots. We shall see

48
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:27,149
I am anxiously awaiting what it possibly is. It's gonna be so much fun. Oh

49
00:04:31,629 --> 00:04:36,300
There is there's a sniper bastard and he's dead. Yeah

50
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:47,910
We're gonna win I think we're gonna win. I really think we're going to win. Hey, man, you've got that invincibility on that's not fair

51
00:04:48,769 --> 00:04:54,949
Whatever. I'll just go have fun. I feel like your birthday party. Did it not hit him? What is?

52
00:04:56,410 --> 00:05:03,040
What's going on with this dude guy was acting really fishy. Hey, what's up? Hey, what's up sniper down?

53
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:09,839
Let us go again. The scout thinks he's gonna get me. He almost did though. That was the thing

54
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:17,810
He almost did get me. No, no, no, no, no get this pyro out of here. Nice job heavy. Nice job

55
00:05:18,769 --> 00:05:22,000

56
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Pyro, mr. Pyro

57
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:33,910
Cap it cap it. Let me help you. Let me help you with that. I got it. I got it

58
00:05:34,189 --> 00:05:44,439
What's going on up here anything any any potty's going on any snipers any snipers that I can kill

59
00:05:44,439 --> 00:05:46,439
Oh this guy down air spy

60
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:53,699
Landed right in his face. He's not dead. I would have got healed by that. That's not cool. That's not cool, man

61
00:05:53,959 --> 00:05:58,980
Hey heavy, where's your like sandwich? Can I like swallow some of it? Oh

62
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:10,160
I just freaked that guy out. I bet you that guy really just said into it like

63
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:15,379
That's not good, that's not good. Oh my good good job

64
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:26,550
Good job, dude. That was a nice kill. You saw the opportunity saw what I was doing and you didn't let me do it

65
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:31,920
That's a good medic. Is this guy just like sniping people with the bison?

66
00:06:33,379 --> 00:06:43,079
Yeah, he's killing people look at the top right. He is actually killing people with that. That's so awesome. Just sniping

67
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:51,470
Scout first scout. Oh

00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:53,470
spy behind me, too

69
00:06:53,709 --> 00:07:00,899
Don't want anyone I don't I just want to kill this heavy because he's the biggest threat and he's scary

70
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:11,720
Do get me out of there. Get me out of there. Hello. Oh, I don't gonna throw up. I hate this

Almost out of coffee. That's not a good thing. Wow. This guy has really been up here the whole time
