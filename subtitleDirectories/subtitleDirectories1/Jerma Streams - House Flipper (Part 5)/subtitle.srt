1
00:00:01,399 --> 00:00:15,900
Hey, how are you? Cool. Okay, what about the rest of you? There's a few of you that didn't say

2
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:31,460
anything. Okay, welcome back. Do I like... I don't even know what that is. I don't know what the

3
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:37,420
latest meme encyclopedia I have to look up. I don't know what that is. I'm not gonna read it.

4
00:00:43,539 --> 00:00:52,740
Garden Flipper tonight, like yesterday. We're back at it again. This time it's a little

5
00:00:52,820 --> 00:01:04,420
different because this time they changed over. We're on static IP and we got a new DNS server.

6
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:16,250
So I don't know how this one will turn out. It might not do anything. I was testing for the last

7
00:01:16,969 --> 00:01:24,329
hour and a half or so just streaming to the test server and it was okay. It was okay.

8
00:01:26,019 --> 00:01:33,219
I'm gonna hold my breath on this though because I'm so used to

9
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:38,810
the last week straight of it being all over the place. It's probably not gonna do anything

10
00:01:41,109 --> 00:01:48,230
but I dropped like 1%, like 2% of frames when I was doing the test which is not great but

11
00:01:48,230 --> 00:02:05,260
it's not terrible either. Am I on the sleep deprivation drug again? No, not really. Not

12
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:11,979
today, although I haven't been getting much sleep. I don't know what it is. Maybe I'm going

13
00:02:11,979 --> 00:02:18,379
through like, I don't know, what's the thing you go through when you get older? Menopause, right?

14
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:40,069
I don't know. Maybe it's that. Manopause. No, but I'm honestly just sitting here for a few

15
00:02:40,069 --> 00:02:47,460
minutes just to take a look and we look pretty clean. I got the green light. Green means

16
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:55,740
go. Red means stop. Yellow means I don't know what to do! I don't know what to do! Should I

17
00:02:55,740 --> 00:03:18,870
go really fast or should I hit the fucking brakes? So, we're gonna go. We got green.

18
00:03:20,069 --> 00:03:24,389
I scared your dog. Hey, turn me up a little bit. Turn the volume up a little.

19
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:30,009
I'll make it right. I'm probably on your television set. Turn me up.

20
00:03:33,539 --> 00:03:39,620
Hey, who's that? Who's that good dog? Are you a good dog? Yes, you are. You are such a good

21
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:50,599
dog. Are you a good dog? Yes. Okay, you can turn me down. You can lower the volume now.

22
00:03:51,080 --> 00:04:05,610
Let me get this on the screen. Hey, that's where we were. Your dog didn't react. That's impossible.

23
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:17,100
I don't believe that. Every dog reacts to that. What is W? W, W, W, W, W?

24
00:04:17,819 --> 00:04:28,540
Why is everybody doing W? Oh, because of the ground. Right. Oh, because of the ground. Right.

25
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:39,589
Like I always am. Right. Okay, right. Right. So, today, I kind of want to do something

26
00:04:39,589 --> 00:04:48,220
real quick. I just want to go look. Yesterday, we had a... I don't know. Let me go see what would...

27
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:55,720
I think I kind of need a clean slate here because where's the one that I already... this one,

28
00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:05,959
right? Go to the house. House price $74,000. I've spent $6,500 on renovation and $36,000.

29
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:14,250
How bad is this place? We got five community subs from Tori. This is cool. No, this is

30
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:21,220
terrible. All right. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I need to do a little walk through here.

31
00:05:22,019 --> 00:05:32,139
Thank you for the five community subs, Tori T. This is not... this is terrible. This is not right.

32
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:58,980
What was wrong with me last night? This is like what happens when you give insects drugs.

33
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:06,790
Wasn't there a video where they gave like a spider like crack? I am the crack spider or like

34
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:18,470
the the fucking cocaine spider. Jeff, thank you for the five community subs, Jeff. I made a big

35
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:28,379
playground. This place... all right. I don't want to do this one anymore. This is horrible.

36
00:06:28,379 --> 00:06:38,339
I don't want to do this house. I, in fact, want to get rid of this house. I don't want this one.

37
00:06:38,339 --> 00:06:46,069
I was on like drugs last night. I was on sleep drugs. None of this works. I hate all of this.

38
00:06:46,069 --> 00:06:55,540
It's making me feel bad. Finish this house. Finish the oven. Oh yeah, it was supposed to

39
00:06:55,540 --> 00:07:04,230
be an oven. Can I not do this? I don't think I want to flip this one. I want to start over.

40
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:22,149
This place sucks. I'm selling it. The art looks all right. Restart this house? No, no. I'll come

41
00:07:22,149 --> 00:07:36,860
back to it. I'll come back to it. I don't like really anything about this. American Crop English

42
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:47,959
Modern. English. It has a free raw layout. Flower bows with blooming colorful perennials

43
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:52,839
and naturally shaped bushes are dominating. Yeah, this is pretty natural. Romantic corners

44
00:07:52,920 --> 00:08:02,790
don't have any of that. What about these crops? I mean, this is pretty, there's no equipment,

45
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:10,680
but excellent. A lot of plants, various surfaces, cleanliness, mown grass. All right. So I got a

46
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:17,050
3% bump on my, on my offers. All right. I'm, I hate this place. I don't want anything to do

47
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:22,470
with it. No, no, no, no. I like this place. I kind of want to keep it. I keep it for now.

48
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:42,179
I'm not going to keep it. I want to start over and I want to do it right. Browser. I

49
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:48,580
got tons of money. Oh, who cares? I just bought a house, half flipped it and then

50
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:58,500
walked out the front door, turned around and went, who cares? Almost only a garden. Okay.

51
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:04,899
New house. Are you going to lose your gamer license? I'll take care of it. This is,

52
00:09:04,899 --> 00:09:10,500
this is the one. This place is, look at this place. This place is bad. $183,000.

53
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:24,299
The home alone house is $400,000, guys. This is a lot of money, but there's no

54
00:09:24,299 --> 00:09:36,389
garden in the home alone house. How do I even, isn't, this is just a regular house.

55
00:09:36,389 --> 00:10:00,570
This doesn't need to be flipped. I hope that wasn't a mistake. I don't have any money left.

56
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:10,840
None of this is garden stuff. All I need to say is that a movie was filmed here

57
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:27,059
and the price already went up. Can I say that? Be careful. Is it trapped still? Oh,

58
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:42,279
I can just sell this stuff. It's not a movie, Jeremy. It's real. Well, I just wasted a

59
00:10:42,279 --> 00:10:46,860
bunch of money. I'll probably just get it right back. This is, okay, this is going to be a real

60
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:57,580
flip job. Holy buckets, 800 bucks. All right. Let's start here. This is already done. This

61
00:10:57,580 --> 00:11:09,700
house is already made. Look at the Christmas tree. This is not a house flipper. This house

62
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:23,379
was flipped before I got here. Maybe a fuse is blown. I'm just like, I'm just cleaning up

63
00:11:23,379 --> 00:11:32,200
this way. I have to do that with every single one of these. Yeah, the fuse is probably

64
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:43,899
in the garage. I'll take care of it. Just hold on. I'm busy. I think I'm replacing LEDs with

65
00:11:45,100 --> 00:12:07,399
like the internal mechanical lights. Why would you replace LEDs? Watch out. Nothing's going to

66
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:20,919
happen. There's no traps. Nothing's going to happen. Oh, look out. A paint can just hit

67
00:12:20,919 --> 00:12:38,220
me right in the fucking mouth. Yeah, this is, it can be, it's not dirty. So much trash here.

68
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:45,860
No, this is not. This is what you think trash looks like. You need to come to my house.

69
00:12:47,139 --> 00:13:08,500
I mean, whoa, whoa, it's a lot dirty. No, I'm actually pretty clean. I'm a pretty clean

70
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:25,399
individual. There's three people living here. Yeah, we've got our own domains. So, okay,

71
00:13:25,399 --> 00:13:29,720
somebody tell me, give me the TLDR here. Was there a reason for me to purchase this house?

72
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:36,659
Are you guys waiting for like the oil to be on the ground and for me to slip and break

73
00:13:36,659 --> 00:13:45,500
my neck? Is that what's going on? I don't think you're going to get it. I'm fairly certain that

74
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:56,059
you're not going to get it. I open up this one and it's just crossbow shoots down the hall

75
00:13:56,059 --> 00:14:09,620
right by my face. Now, this is done. That looks fine. Yeah, I think it's clean. This

76
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:20,360
house is clean. How do you flip a house that's already done? Maybe a fuse is blown. Yeah,

77
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:26,360
I'm going to go look for that. Hold on. There's like trash over here. What's behind the

78
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:37,000
tree? Oh, just glass. All right, let's go turn it all on. There's probably a fuse blown.

79
00:14:41,320 --> 00:15:03,940
Probably. Press E. All right, stick it back in. E. E. Can you play the piano? All right,

80
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:07,980
so that's fine. Everything's good. Just have to turn the fuse on. And then is it going to

81
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:18,779
turn into like a clown show in here? What is all this? Oh, what? Isn't there a basement

82
00:15:18,779 --> 00:15:34,500
in this movie? Kitchen. The knife. Anything with the knives? Nothing. Pizza. It's just a

83
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:49,450
little bit of trash. Not a big deal at all. This ain't a big deal. It's a viscera cleanup

84
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:56,620
detail. It is like viscera. There's only one difference. You can plant trees and you can buy

85
00:15:56,620 --> 00:16:05,860
furniture. It's very similar, but also different at the same time. All right,

86
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:09,700
dispose, dispose, dispose, dispose, dispose. Everything's clean out here.

87
00:16:10,419 --> 00:16:19,210
Is this snow? All right, well, I gotta go down. This is the garage, right?

88
00:16:22,779 --> 00:16:31,750
Destroy this house. Let me just get to the gotcha moment. There will be a gotcha here,

89
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:39,080
and everyone will scream. Let's find it. Here's the fuse box. All right, hold on.

90
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:44,860
It was possible that something was going to run down the stairs at me.

91
00:16:45,419 --> 00:16:54,120
One's broken. This one's nice and fixed. Turn it on. All right, now we have power.

92
00:16:56,470 --> 00:17:16,440
Ooh, wait a minute. What? Dead? No, very much alive. Why? Why do I have this in the house?

93
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:31,460
All right, let's turn on the Christmas tree so everyone can laugh. All right. Can I have my

94
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:35,859
money back? I want a refund on the house. Can you do that? Can you do a refund if you buy a

95
00:17:35,859 --> 00:17:48,380
house? You got 30 days to see if you wanted it or not. Yeah, I'd like to return a house,

96
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:58,140
please. Reason for the return? Uh, I just, no, I'm not feeling it. You guys have like that,

97
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:05,450
like 30-day policy, so I'll just, I'll try another one. Imagine getting a free trial house.

98
00:18:06,089 --> 00:18:09,910
You get 30 days. Why don't they treat houses like they treat mattresses?

99
00:18:10,549 --> 00:18:17,849
You know, you can sleep on a mattress for fucking like three months, and then you just,

100
00:18:17,849 --> 00:18:28,740
if you don't want it anymore, you send it back. All right, let's see. What am I,

101
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:33,640
can I please at least get, I just cleaned it up a little. Nobody does that. No,

102
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:37,079
I know nobody does that, but like look at all every mattress you could ever purchase.

103
00:18:42,059 --> 00:18:46,299
They do like 180 days, like 200 days, some of them. Some of them do a year. Why?

104
00:18:47,019 --> 00:19:03,859
The Smoothe family. All right, I made a profit. $66,000 profit. Positive options,

105
00:19:03,859 --> 00:19:15,509
negative options, okay. Uh, I'm gonna accept, let's negotiate. I mean, come on,

106
00:19:15,509 --> 00:19:29,190
this movie, this was made, this was used in a movie. 30,000? More? What do you mean

107
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:40,470
increase? That's no, just $30,000 is enough. Why is everybody saying increase, increase,

108
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:58,119
increase? They're gonna, all right, you guys are right. Okay, sure, I will take the

109
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:20,410
extra $49,000. Literally scammed those people. Yes, 500,000 and still living here. I get 600

110
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:28,569
grand. Yeah, I, I, I pretend I'm one of those people that I, I'm like the guy down the street

111
00:20:28,569 --> 00:20:33,500
that doesn't ever buy anything but he just sees a secret millionaire. Didn't they like

112
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:37,980
a do a show about like this, the millionaire, like millionaires in the shadows, whatever

113
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:41,420
it was called, or like the secret life of the millionaire. They've done it before.

114
00:20:44,569 --> 00:20:50,859
You should have re-booby-trapped that house. All right, now let's go for real.

115
00:20:50,859 --> 00:20:55,180
That was just a teaser for you and that was a teaser for the internet being actually fine.

116
00:20:55,180 --> 00:21:01,769
Well, all right, I'm not gonna hold my breath. We got this piece of crap but I don't want to

117
00:21:01,769 --> 00:21:14,980
do that one. This is, here's the big one. This is the big one. The pizza oven house is,

118
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:22,759
I'm just, I'm sorry, that's just gonna have to sit on the shelf. That thing sucks. I had

119
00:21:22,759 --> 00:21:32,329
no vision there. I was just like drunk. I was just sleep drunk. At least sell it. I will. I'm

120
00:21:32,329 --> 00:21:47,849
gonna clean it up but this is the big one here. Do the nuclear house. He didn't read the asshole

121
00:21:47,849 --> 00:21:52,410
part. What? Yeah, because I, what do you mean? What are you talking about? I'm gonna do this

122
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:55,769
one. Does this, we got, we got garden flipper. I'm gonna make a good garden. I'm gonna make

123
00:21:55,769 --> 00:22:02,599
an actual really nice one. A large house with a separate garage for two cars in raw condition.

124
00:22:02,599 --> 00:22:10,309
I will sell it right away. Two floors. This is a big one. I'm going for it. I just made some,

125
00:22:10,309 --> 00:22:13,269
I just made this. Let's see how bad this is.

126
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:38,549
Oh my god. Imagine living across the street to this.

127
00:22:38,549 --> 00:22:45,099
You know, we were really thinking about selling it in a year or two but uh,

128
00:22:46,630 --> 00:23:00,950
our property value. Can you at least get rid of the fucking bricks? This house is,

129
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:09,220
probably shows up on those top 10 scary lists. Top 10 scariest abandoned buildings.

130
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:15,750
Top 5 scariest things caught on camera in abandoned houses. Eventually those people are

131
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:18,869
gonna, you know, here's what you understand. You know those people are gonna run out of

132
00:23:18,869 --> 00:23:24,599
shit to make lists of, right? Eventually they're gonna have to start listing very boring things.

133
00:23:27,529 --> 00:23:48,470
Top 5 types of wood to build a bird house. Here's the top 10 cities in a one mile radius

134
00:23:48,470 --> 00:24:02,809
of London. Top 10 towns within five miles of Boston. They'll have to come up with some weird

135
00:24:02,809 --> 00:24:16,250
shit, man. How do I get rid of them? What do I do? What do I do? What do I do?

136
00:24:19,319 --> 00:24:31,480
How do you get rid of the mole? Dude, I did like, I just tried to like spade side down,

137
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:38,170
like shovel vertical on his head. Oh my god, that would have been horrendous.

138
00:24:38,730 --> 00:24:56,920
Why is the mole so big? I don't know. Well fed. You got plenty of trash around here.

139
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:02,809
Plenty of ways for him to grow. Do I need to find him again?

140
00:25:03,450 --> 00:25:11,819
What's the garage look like? I have to get a vision here. This place is huge. This is a

141
00:25:11,819 --> 00:25:31,609
ridiculously large project. See you guys in nine hours. This is so big. I really do want like

142
00:25:31,609 --> 00:25:34,890
screenshots though because I'm gonna put time into this. I'm gonna make this real. You ready?

143
00:25:35,529 --> 00:25:50,890
Keep that in your memory. This is gonna be nice over here. Keep this part in memory too.

144
00:25:50,890 --> 00:26:02,579
This is gonna be a nice long path. I want to start, should we go inside out or outside

145
00:26:02,579 --> 00:26:13,849
in? I feel like you need to go, I don't know. Where do you even start here? You have to just

146
00:26:13,849 --> 00:26:18,460
pick a corner and just start there. All right, we'll start with a dumpster. We'll start with

147
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:24,809
this corner first and I'm gonna get this corner to the way that I like it. I'm gonna

148
00:26:24,809 --> 00:26:35,259
do a nice little garden here in the corner right here. We're gonna do like reds, purples,

149
00:26:42,650 --> 00:26:50,569
weeds. I have the weed wacker too. Where is it right here? We're gonna get some nice grass. I'm

150
00:26:50,569 --> 00:26:54,170
not gonna fuck around on this one. We do have a tree here though which ruins everything.

151
00:26:54,970 --> 00:27:05,990
I have to put down new grass. Can you add water features? I'm not actually not sure.

152
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:16,940
That's a good question. Okay, let's get this out of here. Move it all. I'm gonna, I got a

153
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:28,460
vision. I don't want to turn around either because the second I turn around it's all,

154
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:31,900
it's all bets are off because it's like looking down when you're at a really high height.

155
00:27:35,619 --> 00:27:48,680
I'll fall off. I'm just going for this quadrant right here first. He's sputter walking again.

156
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:53,190
It's gonna happen, okay? It's, that's just gonna happen. All right, don't bite off more

157
00:27:53,190 --> 00:28:03,500
than you can chew. Just easily, easy, easy, easy. Go back here. I'm not supposed to turn around.

158
00:28:14,339 --> 00:28:17,779
All right, that looks all right. Just this side. Well, I gotta lay, we'll lay the grass down.

159
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:33,480
I'll measure it. I'll get the tape measure. Sputter walking champion. Hey, I'm, I, I'm

160
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:38,039
gonna look. I got, I'm doing my garden the way that I want to do my garden. You want to do

161
00:28:38,039 --> 00:28:43,400
your garden the way you want to do your garden? Get some tools and get out here.

162
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:58,460
All right, I'm almost ready to start this section. New gardener skill. Thank God.

163
00:28:59,259 --> 00:29:08,039
I can't, should I not even press this? Is the text coming soon or is the tool coming

164
00:29:08,039 --> 00:29:19,579
soon? I, why would it be? I don't know. Visible moles. 100% faster unfolding grass.

165
00:29:19,579 --> 00:29:38,920
That's a big one. I'm doing this one. You're gardening like my grandma. I can't name you

166
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:59,509
anybody else that gardens. I, I just, all the gardeners that I know are over 50 that like plant

167
00:29:59,509 --> 00:30:08,630
plants and garden. They're all like 55. I don't know anybody personally that gardens. My

168
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:16,470
grandmother used to garden. My mother gardens. A neighbor I had before was a gardener like

169
00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:19,829
really into it. Not like a, wait a second, hold on, there's a difference between like a

170
00:30:19,829 --> 00:30:36,500
professional gardener and like you go outside and you plant plants and stuff. We're talking

171
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:40,900
like hobby gardening or we're talking like you pay me a thousand dollars and I make your outside

172
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:49,190
of your house look nice. Like a professional gardener. Oh, there's plenty of them. Yeah.

173
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:03,480
When did I say that hobby gardening was invalid? I didn't, I didn't say that.

174
00:31:04,779 --> 00:31:10,619
I said the gardeners that like the gardeners that I know are all older like my mother and

175
00:31:10,619 --> 00:31:19,220
her friends and stuff. When did I immediately follow that up going they're invalid? What?

176
00:31:29,589 --> 00:31:45,339
You should know more gardeners. I'm sorry. I don't know very many gardeners. I'm not supposed to

177
00:31:45,339 --> 00:31:57,539
be over here. I'm not supposed to be over there yet. Dumb streamer doesn't even know 10

178
00:31:57,539 --> 00:32:05,619
gardeners. I don't think I know 10 of anything. I don't know 10 plumbers. I don't know 10

179
00:32:05,619 --> 00:32:17,210
firefighters. I don't know 10 gardeners. I know 10 like different people that do different

180
00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:29,319
things. I don't think I know 10 people that do the same thing. Is there more than just this one?

181
00:32:29,319 --> 00:32:49,420
Let's see. Rug grass. Big turf roll. Let's get this right. Top 10. Top 10 workers.

182
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:57,269
This is going to screw me over here though. The tree being in the way. I think start here

183
00:32:57,269 --> 00:33:04,759
go out. I can patch that one up. I'm just going to get it to here. This is going to

184
00:33:05,319 --> 00:33:17,700
line here for now. This corner. Yeah I can't name you 10 of any profession that I know.

185
00:33:18,339 --> 00:33:33,130
Okay that's all good. Or any hobby or whatever. Streamers that I know. That I like personally

186
00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:51,079
know them. Maybe like six? I don't know. I think you guys are severely overestimating

187
00:33:51,079 --> 00:34:00,250
the amount of people that you may know that do a certain thing. That's as close as I can

188
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:12,139
get it. Let me just make sure this is going to work. You can't lay turf on this surface. Why

189
00:34:12,139 --> 00:34:29,900
not? Is it because this grass has to be cut first? That can't be why right? Can I really

190
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:45,929
not lay it here? Can't lay turf on this surface. Wait what the? Okay that was weird.

191
00:34:46,650 --> 00:35:02,579
Oh there's a fork on the ground. Let's see if this rolls out. How fast it goes.

192
00:35:04,650 --> 00:35:16,219
Come on. Come on. Why? Like that's perfect. That roll's not even there. I'm not enjoying

193
00:35:16,219 --> 00:35:19,500
the hitboxes on these because you're always going to have fucked up lines.

194
00:35:20,969 --> 00:35:29,500
Always. I can't ever put something here. Never. All right I got the hammer out out of

195
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:43,500
accident. Like I can put it here. This is going to look so shitty now.

196
00:35:47,769 --> 00:35:57,349
So apparently it can't go here. It can only go here. So I'm going to line it up. Can't go

197
00:35:57,349 --> 00:36:09,780
there. It can go here. All right. Right there. Right here. Let's see if that fixes it. Yeah.

198
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:28,650
That's kind of annoying. Yeah because I will forever have this. I can never lay any grass

199
00:36:28,650 --> 00:36:43,860
there. It's ruined. It's beyond repair. Yeah I know. Look this is not going to be grass.

200
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:49,860
But I mean look. I can. This is going to be grass. This is going to be grass. That's

201
00:36:49,860 --> 00:37:09,460
going to be. I mean I'm trying to save my rolls here. That should overlap enough to give me

202
00:37:10,099 --> 00:37:29,449
no line. Just knock the fence down. If you could. You can't. Receding. Receding grass line.

203
00:37:39,190 --> 00:38:00,300
I might as well move this trash out of the way. Cut. Nice and clean. All right we're making

204
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:11,530
progress. Can I stop the night cycle? I only want it to be day. Day and night mode. Real time.

205
00:38:11,530 --> 00:38:19,400
What time is it? It's going to be like this forever. All right. Real time. Oh wait. Was

206
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:31,349
there another one? What was the other one? Game time. Disabled. Got it. All right. This

207
00:38:31,349 --> 00:38:35,429
is good. I want to work out in the garden. I don't want to go through day and night cycles.

208
00:38:35,429 --> 00:38:45,269
These are to see my immersion. No one's going to be out here at four o'clock in the morning

209
00:38:45,269 --> 00:38:51,880
doing gardening stuff. All right. Yeah. And oh. Jeremy makes another generalization about the

210
00:38:51,880 --> 00:39:03,849
gardeners. Apparently according to Jeremy they're all old ladies and they only work in the day.

211
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:14,280
He's a monster. Did you hear what he said? But that's not what I said.

212
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:34,710
All right. Look at it. Look. Look how much better this is looking than last time.

213
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:41,000
Now here's the problem here. This is going to be an issue. All right. Hold on. Let me line

214
00:39:41,000 --> 00:40:00,710
it up. Line it up. Line it up. All right. No. No. No. No. Which one was it? This one.

215
00:40:00,710 --> 00:40:15,019
It's like moving around. Stop moving around. No. What am I fucking bumping into? Oh my god.

216
00:40:15,019 --> 00:40:33,639
Yeah. This is causing collision. You would just stomp on this. Anybody want a glass of wine?

217
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:51,849
What do you think? Anyone want some wine? Why are you doing that? Look at. Look at.

218
00:40:51,849 --> 00:40:56,949
What am I bumping into? All right. I'm just putting it down. Fuck it. I'm putting it down.

219
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:16,059
Gardening is a dumb. I'm just kidding. I just went off on gardeners.

220
00:41:16,059 --> 00:41:31,699
I don't like gardening. I don't like it at all. I think it's stupid. It looks nice.

221
00:41:31,699 --> 00:41:37,030
No, I will tell you, you know, gardening takes a considerable amount of skill.

222
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:43,260
It's one reason why I know this. I used to help my grandmother do it.

223
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:48,090
Oh, there he goes again. I used to help my grandmother do it. And I would be trying to

224
00:41:48,090 --> 00:41:57,079
even just something as simple as planting, like actually getting the soil ready and then

225
00:41:57,559 --> 00:42:01,960
it's hard to do that. It has to be the right consistency. It has to really hold it up.

226
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:11,260
It's going to be because you can really make it look like crap. Let's get this here.

227
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:21,019
I don't know how it would. No, I'm just going to do them one at a time. That was a nice story.

228
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:31,260
Nice story. Yeah. Let me tell you something, guys. Gardening is difficult to do. And here's

229
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:36,889
why. The soil, you know, you've got to get it in the. So you got to get it. It could

230
00:42:37,769 --> 00:43:03,909
fall over in the soil. That's it. That's the whole story. All right. Just again, don't look

231
00:43:03,909 --> 00:43:11,019
behind me. I mean, you can, but I don't want anyone else to. This is going to go straight

232
00:43:11,019 --> 00:43:23,780
up all the way behind me. Don't look behind you in this game. I don't know what's going on

233
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:29,400
in your real life, but in the video game, we're trying to keep a positive attitude towards

234
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:43,690
our house. No lines. I've gotten pretty good at that. So what the hell? Why couldn't I do

235
00:43:43,690 --> 00:43:58,570
this yesterday? I was like freaking out yesterday. Using the big roll. Yeah, because I got a big

236
00:43:58,570 --> 00:44:11,780
roll. You know how many stacks I got? I got like hundreds rolled up here. I have so many

237
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:20,380
hundreds rolled up like this and I'm bringing to the bank and rubber bands that they get to

238
00:44:20,380 --> 00:44:31,769
get like two managers over to help. OK, let's not get to Orphezelis over here. Oh, yeah.

239
00:44:34,539 --> 00:44:45,880
You're flaunting your money. No, I don't think so. How do you get it? I got to deposit it

240
00:44:45,880 --> 00:45:13,260
somehow. My Chad aura is growing. Damn, you're still rolling grass from yesterday.

241
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:26,179
Yeah, it takes a long time. I haven't gone to sleep. Let's just get it like this.

242
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:40,920
Make it nice and clean. Great. No, that's going to get blocked. That is not going to get

243
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:52,059
blocked. Use those surgery FPS hands. There you go. I've got one more little slab here.

244
00:45:52,059 --> 00:46:00,099
What's going on here? Is there a line? What is this? There's a line here. What's this line?

245
00:46:10,420 --> 00:46:14,099
Did I tell you guys that I'm really into sardines lately? I don't think we had that

246
00:46:14,099 --> 00:46:32,170
conversation. Yeah, I'm really into it. Now we can get a little roll here. A small,

247
00:46:32,170 --> 00:46:38,039
little small one. I just want to get this line. Is that going to get the whole line?

248
00:46:45,130 --> 00:47:06,809
Is that getting it? No. What is this line? This is pissing me off. What's going on here?

249
00:47:06,889 --> 00:47:29,900
Oh, oh, what is this? Oh, no. Is it? It's a shadow. No, like clearly look in there. You

250
00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:42,969
can see the ground. Like right here. That's it. That's clearly grass. That's not a shadow.

251
00:47:45,130 --> 00:48:00,949
That's not a shadow. There's a bump here. That's not a shadow. Look at right there.

252
00:48:00,949 --> 00:48:06,090
And it was, oh yeah, sardines. They're pretty good. And I've been, I've been mashing them

253
00:48:06,090 --> 00:48:17,480
up and then put it on toast. It's pretty damn good. Really good for you too. No,

254
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:26,780
it's not a shadow. Get this off. Disgusting. Why not just buy tuna? Cause

255
00:48:28,730 --> 00:48:35,510
sardines have more selenium and they're also not a predatory fish. So they don't have as much

256
00:48:36,070 --> 00:49:01,610
mercury. Welcome to the school of German. I thought you made that up. No. Welcome to

257
00:49:01,610 --> 00:49:06,329
gardening school. First things first. Welcome to gardening school. Put your tools away.

258
00:49:06,329 --> 00:49:12,780
Everybody put your fucking tools away. Who ate sardines this morning? Raise your hands.

259
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:17,579
None of you? None of you? How old are you guys? Everybody in the room is over 55.

260
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:25,460
Grandma Tilly, what did you have for breakfast this morning? Well, before I planted my

261
00:49:27,460 --> 00:49:50,619
macadamias, I had a small two egg. Wrong. Wrong. I want all of you to go home and

262
00:49:50,619 --> 00:49:56,730
I want you to eat sardines for breakfast tomorrow. All of you. What is it? What is

263
00:49:56,730 --> 00:50:13,909
it Edna? I'm allergic to sardines. Do it anyways. Oh. Later that evening,

264
00:50:13,909 --> 00:50:21,429
German 985 was arrested for having a fake gardener's license and yelling at old people

265
00:50:21,429 --> 00:50:36,409
to eat things that they are allergic to. That was the P.T.? No, that wasn't P.T.

266
00:50:36,409 --> 00:50:46,889
That's not a shadow. Look at that. Oh, that's a shadow. Bullshit. Give me a break.

267
00:50:46,889 --> 00:51:01,000
German, you're dumb. It's a shadow. That's not a shadow. That's like bird feathers. Zoom

268
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:09,590
in on that. This is a shadow. I can see this clearly. These are like bird feathers.

269
00:51:09,590 --> 00:51:40,340
It's all right. It looks fine. We use green carpet on the lines. I think we're almost done.

270
00:51:40,340 --> 00:51:50,659
This is starting to look a little better. This is where I got all messed up yesterday.

271
00:51:51,780 --> 00:52:02,789
Yesterday, I was just going like this. Um, what do I dig over here? What should I do back

272
00:52:02,789 --> 00:52:08,280
here to the plant? No. So what's your vision? Where's the purple? Just hold on.

273
00:52:09,079 --> 00:52:13,699
I have it all up here and I'm going to do it slow. We're going to be here for the next like

274
00:52:13,699 --> 00:52:39,300
six to 12 hours. I'm going to go eat some sardines, marathon gardening, get to water

275
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:48,869
the grass. Probably not. All right. So let me, this is what my, this is my vision here.

276
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:56,489
My vision is to have, I think I want, don't do anything yet. I need to like, I need to

277
00:52:56,489 --> 00:53:03,210
like block it out. I don't like these trees being in the way. I'm thinking they like

278
00:53:03,210 --> 00:53:23,380
descending. Can I build surfaces? Can I like go up? Can I build like up paving slabs?

279
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:42,280
Do mini golf. No. Have a mini golf course. What a dumb house. What a stupid house.

280
00:53:43,750 --> 00:53:49,719
You're the guy with the mini golf course in his house. Should there be a mini golf

281
00:53:49,719 --> 00:53:53,719
in the house too? Should that just be one? No, you don't. This is what happened last time.

282
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:59,320
Last time I was doing this, it was like, oh, what about like a pizza oven? Yeah. Pizza oven.

283
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:18,699
Let's make the whole house a pizza oven. Let me fix this. Can we get, all right, but hold on.

284
00:54:18,699 --> 00:54:23,820
Can we get like the book ending and like the show ending? Can I do like the, can I do like

285
00:54:23,820 --> 00:54:36,420
the books first? I want, I want to do like a garden over here. They're going to be like

286
00:54:36,420 --> 00:54:42,809
two. You're going to see like, can we do like a full metal alchemist here? There'll be

287
00:54:42,809 --> 00:54:55,420
two shows. All right. Everyone's getting in my head. Don't let them get in your head.

288
00:54:55,820 --> 00:55:15,670
Don't let them get in there. I'm in. I'm in. Let's start with this. Let's do,

289
00:55:16,789 --> 00:55:26,889
let's get some concrete here. Let's take a look. Stair. Oh, let me just take a look. I need to

290
00:55:26,889 --> 00:55:45,099
see how this works. Oh, dumb. Hold on. So I can, can I actually do it? All right. I want

291
00:55:45,099 --> 00:55:55,860
to have like a, okay. So I can, that'll be for like another like mini golf hole. I can't

292
00:55:55,860 --> 00:56:07,670
fucking believe I'm doing this. I don't know if I can go that high. Okay. Well,

293
00:56:07,670 --> 00:56:21,610
let's have a staircase to build up into our neighbor's yard. What could this person possibly

294
00:56:21,610 --> 00:56:54,710
be doing? I should put a hole in the wall over here. Oh, shit. Shit. Shit. Hold on. Hey,

295
00:56:54,710 --> 00:57:09,829
Bob. What are you doing over there? What are you up to over there? Oh, nothing. Oh,

296
00:57:09,829 --> 00:57:49,139
that's as far as it goes. It's not. I don't think I could, I actually, can you, why is that I have

297
00:57:49,139 --> 00:58:19,699
to, how am I ever going to delete all this? The game is starting to not like what I'm doing

298
00:58:19,699 --> 00:58:53,539
right now. See, it's really not liking this. Oh God. I think I'm getting into the skybox.

299
00:58:53,539 --> 00:59:22,889
Hey Bob. Hey, what are you doing up there, Ted? Oh, you know, just trying to reach God.

300
00:59:22,889 --> 00:59:31,460
That's all. Got a thing or two to say to him. Hey, why you have to see if you can get

301
00:59:31,460 --> 00:59:53,320
tomorrow's lottery numbers. Okay, Bob. I can't, I can't go anymore. I'm not allowed. I'm at the

302
00:59:53,320 --> 01:00:05,449
box. Should I just make Jenga? I cannot leave this inside. Leave what inside? No, I wait,

303
01:00:05,449 --> 01:00:15,289
I think it thinks I'm in the house. Wait a minute. We got a new plan. Yeah, it thinks

304
01:00:15,289 --> 01:00:36,550
I'm inside the house. So we have to go this way. Where's it hit? Right here. Okay. Ow.

305
01:00:36,550 --> 01:01:04,460
Oh, what have I done? Am I standing on anything? Hey, it's art. Yeah, because see,

306
01:01:04,780 --> 01:01:09,900
I gotta like change that so it's not going in the house. So much for the nice garden somebody

307
01:01:09,900 --> 01:01:16,630
said. What you meant to say was the garden's gonna be up here. I'm making another house up

308
01:01:16,630 --> 01:01:36,940
here. See, this is the front. There's gonna be a beautiful house up here. God damn it.

309
01:01:36,940 --> 01:01:53,750
I'm just telling it. It's whatever. No, I need those. I need these. I need these. I need

310
01:01:53,750 --> 01:02:40,469
this to get up there. Thank God. I can, oh, I want to see if this works. Just breaking

311
01:02:40,469 --> 01:03:18,780
kind of every law. This is so dumb. Uh, hey, Bob, what is it, Ted? You got a rope?

312
01:03:18,780 --> 01:03:35,500
Let's try and jump. No, fuck. Oh, I hate it. I can't, it can't be there. It can't be there.

313
01:03:35,500 --> 01:04:08,099
It can't be there. I can't leave that. It's gonna fucking drive me crazy. All right. Now,

314
01:04:08,099 --> 01:04:13,639
how do I get rid of this one? I can't go straight up because I have to jump over here.

315
01:04:15,340 --> 01:04:22,630
I gotta delete this. Oh God. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait. I think I can make it. All

316
01:04:22,630 --> 01:04:30,090
right. So here's the plan. Shit. Oh, that's not good. I gotta, I gotta go up higher than this.

317
01:04:30,090 --> 01:04:39,849
Wait, wait, hold on. This is not, I don't want to fuck this whole thing up. Just hold on.

318
01:04:39,849 --> 01:05:20,820
Relax everybody. This will just take a second. God, fuck, no. I, I have to restart this

319
01:05:20,820 --> 01:05:24,500
fucking whole thing. Is there any way it's, oh, there has to be a way I can delete this.

320
01:05:24,500 --> 01:05:29,909
Why did I fucking do this? I can't reset it. No, no, no. I can do it. Oh, just get me

321
01:05:29,909 --> 01:05:36,619
up there slow. I'm trying to go too fast. Am I bumping into something? I'm making like

322
01:05:36,619 --> 01:05:43,750
these giant towers just to delete somebody. I saw one person said leave one and just fucked

323
01:05:43,750 --> 01:05:54,519
up the whole thing. I can do it. I can do this. Just wait. I can do it. I'm just going to

324
01:05:54,519 --> 01:06:06,820
start going this way now, make it clean so I can get rid of it. Okay. How far until

325
01:06:10,619 --> 01:06:13,900
there's going to have to be a part two to that. I just wanted to make a garden

326
01:06:14,860 --> 01:06:19,260
and somebody had to say mini golf and then like my like fucking clown meter went to a thousand.

327
01:06:19,900 --> 01:06:53,590
I was doing fine. Okay. My money. Oh, no, not my money. Can I reach it? Oh, I'm not falling

328
01:06:53,590 --> 01:07:10,360
again. If I fall again, I will have, I will reset it. I would have to. Okay. Slow. Thank

329
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:21,239
God. I have to think this through. Think it through. I've got to go up, but then how

330
01:07:21,239 --> 01:07:38,039
do I delete these? Um, I, I think, hold on. Can I, that's not true. Can you, can I actually

331
01:07:38,039 --> 01:07:43,900
do that? I'm afraid to do that. Hold on. Let me get back to where I was. I'm going

332
01:07:43,900 --> 01:07:55,690
to get rid of this one. I can't reach that. Fuck. I don't, I have to delete this first.

333
01:07:55,690 --> 01:08:01,219
I've got to one at a time, one thing at a time. Okay, hold on. So you, what you tell

334
01:08:01,219 --> 01:08:06,710
me you, uh, here come, might be a loud noise, loud noise, potentially incoming,

335
01:08:06,710 --> 01:08:13,929
turn your volume down. Nope. Doesn't do anything. I have to sell it. Okay. So the idea,

336
01:08:14,730 --> 01:08:26,569
here's the idea. If I can build this this way, a couple more, make it clean. So I can,

337
01:08:26,569 --> 01:08:33,829
I can actually walk on this. The cleaner this is, the better,

338
01:08:34,470 --> 01:08:41,289
because then I can actually use it and walk backwards and delete it.

339
01:08:44,220 --> 01:09:00,779
Almost there. Okay. I should now be able to do this. Not yet. I need to build this

340
01:09:00,779 --> 01:09:16,619
one. Okay. Here we go. Come on. Use that brain. Okay. I did it. It's done. Now I

341
01:09:16,619 --> 01:09:23,060
just have to, we're going to go down here and then know which one, what do I do first?

342
01:09:25,220 --> 01:09:34,140
I've made, yeah, I've made this a puzzle game. I have to start over here. Don't

343
01:09:34,220 --> 01:09:56,890
fall off. Falling off ruins. If I fall now, it's fucked the whole thing forever. My heart

344
01:09:56,890 --> 01:10:03,850
should not be beating this fast. What's wrong with me? Why? All right. I'm doing it. I'm

345
01:10:03,850 --> 01:10:13,909
going for it. I got it. I'm so paranoid because if I fall now, see, look at,

346
01:10:13,909 --> 01:10:28,699
I fucked it up there. It's all right, everybody. Calm down. Oh, mini golf.

347
01:10:28,699 --> 01:10:34,220
Oh, we're going to build stairs now. Just going to nowhere.

348
01:10:40,250 --> 01:11:02,260
They're getting denser. I have to, oh fuck. It's like climbing Everest. I feel like I'm really

349
01:11:02,260 --> 01:11:07,300
standing on these. I don't like this at all. I'm never doing this ever again. I'm never doing

350
01:11:07,300 --> 01:11:12,039
this in this game ever again. Why would I ever do it in the first place? Now there is a lip.

351
01:11:13,500 --> 01:11:20,220
Can I cross? Yep. Thank God. Oh, all right. That one's done. Now we have to go all the way up.

352
01:11:21,739 --> 01:11:44,260
Part two. We have to go, now we have to go from here. All the way up and then all the way down.

353
01:11:58,310 --> 01:12:01,430
As long as I do it right and I can sell them each one as I go down.

354
01:12:05,189 --> 01:12:15,720
All right, here we are. Right here. Bang. Straight up. Don't fall off.

355
01:12:28,520 --> 01:12:33,640
Don't make me laugh. If I fall off right now, you understand that the whole thing

356
01:12:35,659 --> 01:12:41,659
was to get this one tower and if I fall off, I have to do it again because I made two now.

357
01:12:48,500 --> 01:12:52,579
Fucking Jesus. And then I have to make three and then I have to make four.

358
01:12:54,680 --> 01:13:02,460
Don't! Where am I? Oh no, where am I? What am I standing on? Okay, I made it. I made it. I

359
01:13:02,460 --> 01:13:31,670
can't jump. Okay, here we go. Okay, I'm good. I did it. I actually did it. Oh, thank God.

360
01:13:44,899 --> 01:13:55,289
Oh, thank goodness. That whole crisis can now be put behind us. Seriously. Oh, fuck. Easy.

361
01:13:55,850 --> 01:15:10,840
Uh oh. Oh! I missed one? What are you talking about? I did not miss one. Wait, did I? Lie.

362
01:15:13,100 --> 01:15:26,149
I will not have that. It's clean. There's not one up there. Oh man, that would have sucked. Okay,

363
01:15:26,149 --> 01:15:35,859
what? What are we doing? All right, I got those in my vision. There's one near the tree. No,

364
01:15:35,859 --> 01:15:50,039
there is not one near the tree. They're all gone. Build a roller coaster. What do you mean

365
01:15:50,039 --> 01:16:04,420
the tree? Nobody sees it. It's a lie. All right, here we go. I want to make a garden here.

366
01:16:04,500 --> 01:16:10,489
I'm gonna say, let's start from here. I want like a nice little patch right here coming out

367
01:16:11,210 --> 01:16:16,550
to here. But the trees are in the way. Why can't I just get rid of the trees?

368
01:16:16,550 --> 01:16:35,670
I don't want those trees. Make a roller coaster. No. All right, I'll have to incorporate

369
01:16:35,670 --> 01:16:47,020
the trees. So, I want, I want like, God, I want. Anybody want some wine? I think I'm

370
01:16:47,020 --> 01:17:00,409
gonna get a glass of wine. Just like one. I want to sip on it. I haven't had like a good

371
01:17:00,409 --> 01:17:10,569
wine in a while. Yeah, go get, go get some wine. I'm gonna need your help here. I'm gonna need

372
01:17:10,569 --> 01:17:16,149
your help in creating this garden. In the comment section, what do you think I should

373
01:17:16,149 --> 01:17:24,979
put in the next episode? A tree? A moat? You decide. All right, I'm gonna go, let's just

374
01:17:24,979 --> 01:17:32,329
have a glass of wine. I'll be right back. I'm just, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'll be less than,

375
01:17:32,329 --> 01:22:28,279
I'll be less than 30 minutes, I promise. Time. All right, I'm good. Let's go. Two minutes? Five

376
01:22:28,279 --> 01:22:45,369
minutes? Three minutes? How many minutes? 89 seconds? I feel like it was longer than that.

377
01:22:45,369 --> 01:22:57,640
We want you to build a ferris wheel in time. In time. I got 399,000. So, wait, let's see.

378
01:22:58,520 --> 01:23:03,609
I'm getting overwhelmed. I'm overwhelming myself. Slow. I'm not going to even look at

379
01:23:03,609 --> 01:23:14,550
Chad for like another 25 streams. Okay, what did I want to do? 103, 104. Stop counting. I'm

380
01:23:14,550 --> 01:23:38,890
breaking my own rule. Okay, I'm gonna test. Architecture. Oh, oh, round gazebo with a dome.

381
01:23:38,890 --> 01:23:51,140
Let me see. I like that one. Hold on. I'm gonna have such a rich house. Cobblestone

382
01:23:51,699 --> 01:24:03,699
circle stair up a little stairway up to the gazebo. Three level garden stair. I could have

383
01:24:03,699 --> 01:24:26,649
just done these. Hmm. I don't know which one. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. How about this one?

384
01:24:26,649 --> 01:24:50,890
Let's just see what it looks like. I can just sell it. That's too big. I think it's too big

385
01:24:50,890 --> 01:25:10,710
to put anywhere. Maybe here? I need the mini one. But I can't put a garden in here.

386
01:25:10,710 --> 01:25:17,449
This is bigger than the other one. No, that didn't say mini gazebo. It was minio gazebo,

387
01:25:17,449 --> 01:25:41,140
not mini. I don't think maybe I don't even need one of these. What if it was like a

388
01:25:41,140 --> 01:25:47,500
little entryway off of the okay. So hold on. Here we are. Here's the front door. We're gonna

389
01:25:47,500 --> 01:25:54,060
get some nice stones here with a little another walkway that leads over here into the garden.

390
01:25:57,239 --> 01:26:00,760
So it goes you go through here. You go through the metal detector to make sure like

391
01:26:02,010 --> 01:26:11,020
and then you come to the garden. It's crooked. Yeah, I just I'm just placing it there.

392
01:26:15,100 --> 01:26:30,039
Well, I didn't maybe didn't pick the right color. Well, not. Yeah, get out of here.

393
01:26:30,760 --> 01:26:42,489
Just I'm gonna put it there for now. I need a front entryway here.

394
01:26:43,289 --> 01:26:47,689
Entryway over this way leading into the garden here. There can be a nice garden here

395
01:26:48,569 --> 01:26:52,090
right here for you to look at. And it starts right here like this.

396
01:26:54,100 --> 01:26:57,779
I'm gonna I wanted the I want the purple scheme that I had. Why are you fail fishing

397
01:26:57,779 --> 01:27:08,819
me? I put a I I put a the wooden stand. What's wrong with that? I placed it on the

398
01:27:08,819 --> 01:27:16,340
ground. It's not going to be there permanently. No, you're getting out. You're getting in the way

399
01:27:16,340 --> 01:27:20,340
of my vision. All right, so we're gonna have I want the purple, the red, the I want the purple

400
01:27:21,060 --> 01:27:26,090
red and the and like kind of pink scale going up. Watch what I'm doing here.

401
01:27:26,090 --> 01:28:10,329
Pay attention. Close fucking attention. Nice fence. Let's keep it that same color.

402
01:28:11,210 --> 01:28:28,970
Looks awful. What if it looks awful? It doesn't look awful. I haven't even done

403
01:28:28,970 --> 01:29:11,609
anything. No, it's gonna be it's gonna be to here. What are you guys on about?

404
01:29:12,010 --> 01:29:51,350
What are you guys on right now? Why does this look wrong? That's better. The car guys,

405
01:29:51,350 --> 01:30:00,229
the cars have to be able to go. Wait. Oh, fuck me. Okay, no. Um, no, this is still fine.

406
01:30:00,229 --> 01:30:08,600
This is fine. This is this is the gate to the backyard. Everyone has a gate to the backyard.

407
01:30:08,600 --> 01:30:13,699
Gate to the backyard and there's a nice walkway garden. Everyone that's talking all

408
01:30:13,699 --> 01:30:23,130
this shit and typing all this shit in just under 12 to 15 hours, but would take a normal

409
01:30:23,130 --> 01:30:32,789
person probably six. You're gonna eat those words. Why do you have an entrance in the middle

410
01:30:32,789 --> 01:30:40,619
of your front yard? Because this is not the front yard. This is now the backyard.

411
01:30:41,420 --> 01:30:55,270
This is the backyard. Here's the front yard. And then boom, backyard. Well, technically,

412
01:30:55,270 --> 01:31:07,460
actually, it should be lined up here. I used to do this shit for money. Okay. I used to

413
01:31:07,460 --> 01:31:28,500
move fences for money. I think I know what's going on. I knew it was wrong.

414
01:31:29,140 --> 01:31:49,369
Is there like a snapping feature? Because I can't get a good look as I have to.

415
01:31:49,369 --> 01:32:49,050
I'm gonna sneeze. There's nothing I can do. I'm gonna sneeze again. I can't press any buttons.

416
01:32:49,930 --> 01:33:08,500
You don't like people sneezing. Just close it. Come on. Flush. Flush. Damn it. Don't

417
01:33:08,500 --> 01:33:27,689
make me get the plunger. Toilet humor. That wasn't what? How is that like a toilet like

418
01:33:27,689 --> 01:33:48,550
poo poo joke? I could have been flushing anything. God damn it. Can I add like a

419
01:33:48,550 --> 01:34:04,819
section? Half fence? No. Fuck. No. Why? Why can I not extend this? I'm gonna have to

420
01:34:04,819 --> 01:34:14,199
have a tree right here. This is a doggy entrance. No, this is the entrance to the back garden.

421
01:34:14,199 --> 01:34:21,300
Just use hedges. There are hedges already here. That's gonna look fucking strange.

422
01:34:21,859 --> 01:34:25,140
There's already like a line of bushes. Oh, just put another one right here.

423
01:34:25,779 --> 01:34:39,460
No criminal will just like wedge his way into it. Is it straight? Let's give it a good look.

424
01:34:39,460 --> 01:34:45,020
It's pretty, it's pretty straight. I cannot delete these bushes. No,

425
01:34:46,069 --> 01:34:52,149
we'll put something there. We'll figure it out. All right. Anyways, so here,

426
01:34:53,109 --> 01:35:00,789
bang. Nice little garden to start. In fact, I'm gonna do bingo. Bingo. This is gonna drive

427
01:35:00,789 --> 01:35:41,640
me fucking crazy. It's gonna drive me crazy. Oh, God damn it. Just roll it out there.

428
01:35:42,199 --> 01:35:52,020
I'm just gonna have it go all the way. Jermis, please stop. Please stop what?

429
01:35:56,729 --> 01:36:07,130
What? Why? Just stop it. What do you want me to stop exactly?

430
01:36:07,130 --> 01:36:21,029
The grass is crooked. Once it's all laid out there, you're not gonna know. That

431
01:36:21,029 --> 01:36:39,689
would be different. I'm getting there. It's gonna look really nice. I promise.

432
01:36:39,689 --> 01:36:42,890
If there's one thing I can promise you, is it will look good.

433
01:36:43,770 --> 01:36:50,250
Pick up the trash first. I'm just going one at a time because if I,

434
01:36:55,350 --> 01:37:02,489
just stop. Don't make promises you can't keep. I see you mean like over here.

435
01:37:03,210 --> 01:37:23,189
Because I need to, I need to get it finished as I go. Yeah, I'm supposed to be in the other

436
01:37:23,189 --> 01:37:36,020
corner. What situation should Jermapup be used in? That's at your discretion,

437
01:37:36,020 --> 01:37:59,319
whatever you feel. Good, good, good. Come here. All right, that should be enough.

438
01:37:59,880 --> 01:38:15,479
Let's get the edge here. I don't see any more on the mini-map in this corner, at least.

439
01:38:15,479 --> 01:38:18,819
So I think we're good. Except it's behind the hedges though, which is,

440
01:38:18,819 --> 01:38:22,680
how the hell would you even see that? There's no way you would see that shit.

441
01:38:23,479 --> 01:38:46,699
I can't get it all in one pass, unfortunately. Come on, look at the mini-map. It's right here.

442
01:38:49,159 --> 01:39:08,890
Did I get it? Yeah, I did. Come on, get it. Get it all. Oh, yes. Okay, there's one last

443
01:39:08,890 --> 01:39:17,479
little speck right here. Got it in one more right here. All right, we're officially completely

444
01:39:17,479 --> 01:39:29,500
clean on this right side. Now the only question is just getting the grass laid out here so I

445
01:39:29,500 --> 01:39:37,909
can start building. Look at how much more of this is going to be so ridiculous.

446
01:39:39,109 --> 01:39:46,310
I'm never going to stop streaming. Well, the internet has been pretty decent so far. So,

447
01:39:46,310 --> 01:39:54,630
I mean, if I got internet, I ain't fucking turning it off. Congratulations, you mowed the

448
01:39:54,630 --> 01:40:06,359
lawn. Be nicer. You're being very mean. I normally mowed the lawn. I picked up

449
01:40:07,079 --> 01:40:16,619
3,000 pounds of trash and I'm rolling out new grass. That's a very mean thing to say.

450
01:40:24,199 --> 01:40:38,300
See, it just happens sometimes. It just does it. There's so much Z-fighting on that fence.

451
01:40:38,300 --> 01:41:08,710
What do you mean, Z-fighting? Z-fighting? What is a Z-fighting? Like anti-aliasing? Are

452
01:41:08,710 --> 01:41:16,819
we getting a bunch of aliasing? What do you mean, Z-fighting? I don't think I can

453
01:41:16,819 --> 01:41:22,420
get it all in one roll, but it's worth a try. I have no idea. I have no idea what

454
01:41:22,420 --> 01:41:37,930
you're talking about. I don't know what Z-fighting is. Oh, the grass in the back?

455
01:41:39,640 --> 01:41:55,420
Why would I know what Z-fighting means? It's like being in the doctor's office.

456
01:41:55,420 --> 01:42:02,710
Doctor comes in. Do you know what this tool is? I don't know. Is it a stethoscope? No,

457
01:42:02,710 --> 01:42:08,250
stupid. Why do you not know that? It's a hydroscope. What, are you stupid? You're

458
01:42:08,250 --> 01:42:21,460
pretty dumb. Oh, okay. Ha, I'm an idiot. Right chat. He's got a fucking GoPro on.

459
01:42:22,180 --> 01:42:40,710
He's like looking away while he's doing like an exam.

460
01:42:45,180 --> 01:42:52,699
Everything seems fine. Doctor, my stomach is hurting. You're touching my neck. Oh,

461
01:42:52,699 --> 01:43:08,069
sorry. I was looking at chat. What'd you come in for? That shit's gonna be real.

462
01:43:11,579 --> 01:43:15,319
You think that's me fucking around? Give it like another 50 years.

463
01:43:31,260 --> 01:43:40,140
What would his alert sounds be? A flatline. Hey, thank you, flatliners. Welcome to the

464
01:43:40,140 --> 01:43:54,329
flatliners. Am I okay? Yeah, he comes in. Your leg hooked up. You're like just had

465
01:43:54,329 --> 01:44:04,579
surgery. You're sitting there. All of a sudden the flatline comes on. Is something wrong?

466
01:44:04,579 --> 01:44:18,729
What's happening? Thank you, bddoc21666. 25 months. Welcome to the flatlining patients.

467
01:44:19,909 --> 01:44:26,039
Yeah, you just flatlined, didn't you? Oh, here, take these. This would help for the

468
01:44:26,039 --> 01:44:47,500
pain and oh, thank you. Hey, whoa, 20, 32 months sub just came in from oh, hey, doc should poison

469
01:44:47,500 --> 01:45:06,680
the patient. That's a funny username. But no, seriously, take those once every four hours.

470
01:45:06,680 --> 01:45:18,729
This is not gonna work. What even is this room? What is this? Room 86 M2. All right,

471
01:45:18,729 --> 01:45:23,449
hold on. This is the front door and then this is so this is a back slider and then

472
01:45:24,090 --> 01:45:28,500
this is like another two car garage. No, the staircase is here. There's another back door.

473
01:45:31,699 --> 01:45:44,539
Oh, this is a sub. Hey, thank you. Thank you. Room 86 M2 for the 12 months. Appreciate it. No,

474
01:45:44,539 --> 01:45:56,970
that's not the garage. The garage is over here. It's a normal living room. Is it though?

475
01:45:56,970 --> 01:46:03,689
Because you have two, three back entry ways to the it's kind of odd. I don't think that

476
01:46:04,329 --> 01:46:07,529
one of these this would be normal. But this is seems like kind of redundant.

477
01:46:10,260 --> 01:46:28,020
Somebody just gave $115. That's $115. That's Hayden clip fell for the 115 bucks.

478
01:46:28,659 --> 01:46:43,689
That's a lot of money. There's no message here. You've just flatlined. Welcome. You've just

479
01:46:43,689 --> 01:46:49,770
flatlined. I've just flatlined. No, no, idiot. I'm looking to chat. You're dumb.

480
01:47:04,500 --> 01:47:11,449
It would be a scenario. Doctor's doing surgery. But first of all, before we get into this,

481
01:47:11,449 --> 01:47:15,130
that's a fucking lot of money. There's no message here. You just gave me a ton of money.

482
01:47:15,130 --> 01:47:23,529
Thank you, Hayden. That's a lot of fucking money. Thank you. All I can say is thanks.

483
01:47:23,529 --> 01:47:33,930
That's more than I could ever ask anyone to ever give me in in dollars ever. What's

484
01:47:33,930 --> 01:47:49,060
going on here? Why? Strange. But yeah, imagine the doctor's doing surgery. He's got the chat

485
01:47:49,060 --> 01:47:56,340
open. And he's doing like, like a gallstone removal on somebody. All of a sudden, he like

486
01:47:56,340 --> 01:48:03,420
misses one blind, blind, dude, I can't can you not see that? How can he be this stupid? He

487
01:48:03,420 --> 01:48:10,779
can't see that other gallstone. What are you guys talking about? I got them all. Wow. Holy

488
01:48:10,779 --> 01:48:21,989
shit. He's so bad. He like moves it moves the organ over here. I don't over this way.

489
01:48:27,189 --> 01:48:49,909
Is he pretending? Is he pretending to be this bad? He's faking it. You know how people like

490
01:48:50,789 --> 01:49:15,800
overreact and stuff like, whoa, jump scare. Actually overreacting twitch doctor. Yeah,

491
01:49:15,800 --> 01:49:20,520
somebody comes in, they get like, oh, yeah, I feel like really strange recently. Like I was

492
01:49:20,520 --> 01:49:24,279
outside in the woods outside the woods. Oh, yeah, what chat? I wonder what it could be.

493
01:49:24,279 --> 01:49:28,420
Let's guess it. What should we do? I'm gonna put the clicks on the screen. What do you think

494
01:49:28,420 --> 01:49:47,020
we should test them for? I think tick-borne tick-borne. I think so. Get some results back.

495
01:49:47,579 --> 01:49:55,510
Yeah, it was tick. Yeah. Yeah. Tick-borne illness. We got it. Chat. We got it. Pogchamp.

496
01:49:55,510 --> 01:50:11,750
No, no, no, it'd be something else. It'd be like, it'd be like doc champ. And it'd be

497
01:50:11,750 --> 01:50:23,560
like him with a stethoscope on like having his mouth open like what? I mean, the small

498
01:50:24,039 --> 01:50:36,520
look like cigars or no, they look like those little Debbie rolls. You know, those chocolate

499
01:50:36,520 --> 01:50:44,439
rolls. What are they called? The swirls like the little Debbie rolls. Swiss rolls. There it is.

500
01:50:44,439 --> 01:51:00,119
Yeah. No, not turd rolls. Swiss rolls. The doctor's been screaming for like fucking

501
01:51:00,119 --> 01:51:06,409
eight hours straight in the middle of like fucking surgery. Oh, that's going to be it.

502
01:51:06,409 --> 01:51:10,890
I think I'm just fucking beat, you know, I'll see you guys tomorrow. We'll pick it up for

503
01:51:10,890 --> 01:51:19,640
where we left off. Just keep this guy in sedation. I'll just just save the game.

504
01:51:19,640 --> 01:51:34,149
Yeah, I'll save it here. Fuck, to take some wine breaks. I don't think I can get over here.

505
01:51:34,149 --> 01:51:38,229
Same problem from last time. There's going to be this one tiny little stupid patch that I

506
01:51:38,229 --> 01:51:53,590
can't get. Oh, that's annoying. Oh, that's annoying. I hate that. Come on. Nope. Just

507
01:51:53,590 --> 01:52:06,630
gravel. Yeah, I'll have to. Oh, that's, I hate it. No, this collision here for some

508
01:52:06,630 --> 01:52:27,909
reason. Delete the trees? I can't. Oh, I fucking thought I had it. Oh well. Can't get them all.

509
01:52:27,909 --> 01:52:36,140
But I can do this. Sell trees. Sell, you can't sell trees. Look, look, look, look, look, look.

510
01:52:38,579 --> 01:52:58,630
See? Cheaty. Looks good. I mean, I know I did, I said I wasn't going to do this,

511
01:52:58,630 --> 01:53:10,380
but I might as well. Jerma, please, I'm a fan. Concerned about your, I've been adamant,

512
01:53:10,380 --> 01:53:12,779
in the past you've been adamant that you've been fine, but now it seems like you need

513
01:53:12,779 --> 01:53:16,060
at least one glass each stream to get by. Is it us? Do we make the stream harder to get

514
01:53:16,060 --> 01:53:43,289
through? Jesus Christ. Is it us? The last time I had a glass of wine on stream or alcohol

515
01:53:43,289 --> 01:53:50,619
on stream was Nintendo Labo. That was like three and a half weeks ago. Almost a month ago.

516
01:53:51,180 --> 01:53:57,260
More than that. Uh, so I, I don't know what stream you're talking about because that's

517
01:53:57,260 --> 01:54:09,850
not this one. Hammer the tree? It don't work. Watch, I'll prove it. See? Told you. Told you.

518
01:54:11,979 --> 01:54:19,180
Oh, Jebaited. Chat, you know, you don't understand. It doesn't work. I'm not going to use the,

519
01:54:19,180 --> 01:54:24,060
the saw on his bone, on his leg. That's not going to work. It's not going to fix his,

520
01:54:24,060 --> 01:54:29,529
uh, it's not going to fix his gallbladder. Do it, do it, do it. Oh my God. All right, fine.

521
01:54:33,779 --> 01:54:55,539
See? Oh, did I just get Jebaited? Oh, he used drill on toe. He's still on the doctor bit.

522
01:54:55,539 --> 01:55:02,260
Yeah, I'm kind of stuck on it. I just, things just keep popping into my brain. So I have to

523
01:55:02,260 --> 01:55:20,119
just say them out loud. Right, wait, right there, right here. Oh, come on. What do you mean,

524
01:55:20,119 --> 01:55:32,729
clear the path? There's nothing in the path. The path is already written. Come on. I'm the

525
01:55:32,729 --> 01:55:38,090
best. I'm the best. I'm the best at what I do. I'm the best. I'm the best. I'm the best

526
01:55:38,170 --> 01:56:03,399
at what I do. What is it that you do? Whatever it is I do. I mean, that's, come on. That's clear.

527
01:56:03,399 --> 01:56:15,460
Look at how far away this is. Patch notes. Garden Flipper. 1.104. Remove collision around

528
01:56:15,460 --> 01:56:45,100
trees. Come on. Come on. I'm just going to have to like go like this. I shouldn't have to

529
01:56:45,100 --> 01:57:27,050
do it like this. Yeah, I'm done. I'm done. Yeah, I'm, no, I'm done. That's it. I

530
01:57:27,050 --> 01:57:35,850
somehow made it worse. I know. And that's why I gave up. I'm going to do one right here.

531
01:57:37,260 --> 01:57:45,289
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, stutter step, stutter step, stutter step. Maybe I should just

532
01:57:45,289 --> 01:57:49,140
clean it all up. But then I'm going to be overwhelmed. I'm going to look around and go,

533
01:57:49,140 --> 01:57:58,579
fuck, this is too big. I'm just going to make a pizza oven as the house. All right. No,

534
01:57:58,579 --> 01:58:05,460
it's clean enough for me to do what I want to do over here. Now I've got to get my vision

535
01:58:05,460 --> 01:58:25,260
to unfold. Come on. Think about something. Okay, I got it. Get this out of the way.

536
01:58:26,060 --> 01:58:37,380
We're going to go one step at a time. I need a entryway. First of all, we need a door here.

537
01:58:37,380 --> 01:58:45,500
First of all, give me a door so I can look at this the way that I should look at it. No,

538
01:58:45,500 --> 01:58:53,100
not yet. Cause I need to, I need, um, we're going to go stone, stone, stone, stone, stone.

539
01:58:54,359 --> 01:59:04,329
Um, no, I won't put the surface. No, not the terrible tablet that fucking crashes every

540
01:59:04,329 --> 01:59:19,430
five minutes. I want one of these. Hmm. What I want for a walk. Maybe take the gravel.

541
01:59:24,869 --> 01:59:38,380
This is nice. Let's see what this looks like. I'm thinking the beige. I think there's a bigger

542
01:59:38,380 --> 01:59:57,619
version of this. No, that looks like dog shit. I don't want that. I like this. How does it feel

543
01:59:57,619 --> 02:00:12,390
to be employed by thousands of people? I mean, I'm a man of the people. Hmm. Orange,

544
02:00:12,390 --> 02:00:22,149
orange isn't bad, but dark gray is not bad either. Let's see. Let me see what this looks

545
02:00:22,149 --> 02:00:28,069
like. I need to get paving stones, painting stones block without a curve, paving stone.

546
02:00:28,069 --> 02:00:35,640
That's going to get paving stone, paving stones. Here we go. All right. That looks all right.

547
02:00:40,520 --> 02:00:53,189
Ooh, we can do a little trim too. Ooh, that is a really, really nice blue and white

548
02:00:53,189 --> 02:01:14,550
paving stone. Hmm. That's a beautiful blue and white. What are you talking about? You see,

549
02:01:14,550 --> 02:01:21,739
you see gold and where's the gold? I don't understand what you're talking about. Golden

550
02:01:21,739 --> 02:01:30,760
and blue. What? I don't see that shit. What are you crazy? That's not the color of that dress.

551
02:01:32,119 --> 02:01:44,420
Your brain is wired strangely. You guys don't know what I'm talking about. That is like,

552
02:01:44,420 --> 02:01:52,180
this is the exact color scheme of that picture. What? That's like, this is the same exact

553
02:01:52,180 --> 02:02:08,039
color scheme. Golden, white, blue. Yeah, come on. Did I see this joke on Facebook? I saw

554
02:02:08,039 --> 02:02:24,170
the picture on Facebook. I like this. Jeez. Fucking rough crowd tonight. Rough crowd out

555
02:02:24,170 --> 02:02:34,619
there. Be careful. They're all like drinking wine. Uh, should I go into the house with this?

556
02:02:34,619 --> 02:03:11,560
Let's get a little bit more here. How's this wrong? It's not even wrong. Wrong. This is

557
02:03:11,560 --> 02:03:21,260
actually very incorrect. If you were looking, no, this is not wrong because look, guys, guys,

558
02:03:21,260 --> 02:03:26,470
guys, guys. If it is, if it's lined up perfectly here, then it won't be lined up

559
02:03:26,470 --> 02:03:41,220
perfectly with the door. Uh-oh. Have we reached like the event horizon here? We're

560
02:03:41,220 --> 02:04:06,020
at the event horizon. How does this look? That's not bad. No, no, no, no. What happened

561
02:04:06,020 --> 02:04:26,340
there? Okay. Then we're going to go like this. Okay. What color do I want for gravel? Two-tone.

562
02:04:26,899 --> 02:04:31,510
Look up, look up. We got like a, let me just see what this would look like.

563
02:04:32,149 --> 02:05:03,930
I can't just put it. Why can I not do that? Well, I can. This is grandma's rug. It's

564
02:05:03,930 --> 02:05:09,739
not grandma's rug. It doesn't look like, I know, we already made the fish tank reference,

565
02:05:09,739 --> 02:05:32,649
the bottom of the ocean reference. I need to do rounded, I think. Do the other side.

566
02:05:33,739 --> 02:05:39,659
Uneven laughing my ass off. Oh, get out of here. Get out of here with that. What do you mean

567
02:05:39,659 --> 02:05:47,340
uneven? I got, it's, yeah, it is uneven. It's rocks. They're rocks. You can't have a straight

568
02:05:47,340 --> 02:06:06,920
line with rocks. Uneven. Oh my God. It's uneven. Those crushed stones. Hey, better

569
02:06:06,920 --> 02:06:16,789
than your house. I love that argument. Better than what you have. Better than what you did.

570
02:06:16,789 --> 02:06:22,970
Dude, this stream like sucks. Oh, better than your stream. Have you streamed before?

571
02:06:22,970 --> 02:06:33,750
Better than your stream. I don't, fuck you buddy. Actually, I want to go a little, a little more.

572
02:06:33,750 --> 02:06:46,119
Hey dude, on the webcam, you had like something in your teeth. I did, like a bunch of asparagus

573
02:06:46,119 --> 02:06:51,619
or shit. Yeah, better than your stream. Do you stream? You don't fucking know. No, I'm, okay.

574
02:06:51,619 --> 02:07:15,579
I should probably do round. Hey dude, I, did you just like punch a guy in the face on stream

575
02:07:15,579 --> 02:07:20,069
that didn't do anything? Okay. Yeah. Whatever. You don't stream. Where's your stream if it's

576
02:07:20,069 --> 02:07:39,130
so easy? This is not good. What? I'm just starting. This is going to expand out a little.

577
02:07:39,130 --> 02:07:41,770
Give me some, give me a day. Do you even stream? Do you even know what it's like?

578
02:07:47,260 --> 02:07:54,939
The fucking Dreamcast sucks. Laughing my ass off. The Dreamcast, what was it? It was the Dreamcast

579
02:07:54,939 --> 02:08:02,060
fucking sucks. Laughing my ass off. All right, I did fuck that one up. I'll give that one to

580
02:08:02,060 --> 02:08:10,260
you. I'll give that one to you. Yeah, I fucked it up. Dad, what are you, okay. Thank, great. What, why?

581
02:08:12,699 --> 02:08:25,050
Actually, hold on a second here. I think I can, I'm going to do some sculpting.

582
02:08:25,850 --> 02:08:48,329
This is gonna, this is gonna be actually kind of cool. They didn't go out of the gate. Bad

583
02:08:49,210 --> 02:08:53,529
illusions of sculpting. No, I'm gonna start out big here and we're gonna put a couple of

584
02:08:53,529 --> 02:09:09,060
bushes in the shit. Just bear with me. I'm gonna do some sculpting. This is not ruined.

585
02:09:09,779 --> 02:09:38,359
You guys have ever been to a house in Las Vegas? That shows. You guys, no, never mind.

586
02:09:38,359 --> 02:10:11,529
I'm gonna, just watch. Wait, just give me a second. Guys, Rome wasn't built in a day.

587
02:10:12,489 --> 02:10:30,310
It looks like the house is puking. I want that guy out of here for life. Comparing this house to

588
02:10:30,310 --> 02:10:35,029
Rome. Yes, I am. If there's a problem with that, you don't even know it's like to stream.

589
02:10:36,760 --> 02:10:54,390
Okay, I'll stop that one. Okay, hold on here. That's why I need enough to like

590
02:10:54,949 --> 02:11:09,189
carve. Okay, here we go. Here we go. Here we go. Here we go. Here we go.

591
02:11:09,829 --> 02:11:41,939
Dude, I can't help that it makes like the jagged Minecraft pixels. Okay,

592
02:11:41,939 --> 02:11:51,609
you guys want perfection? Fine. It's not possible. Perfection doesn't exist.

593
02:11:51,609 --> 02:12:15,939
Get that out of your head. Perfection doesn't exist, he says. Okay, now here I wanted to

594
02:12:15,939 --> 02:12:40,729
go like this. All right, right here. Make it look a little more natural. I wish I could have the

595
02:12:40,729 --> 02:12:57,880
like Photoshop. Why is this not Photoshop? I really need to, I need to get like here.

596
02:13:02,329 --> 02:13:17,739
Okay, you see that line? Pull this in a little more. Okay, it's hard to do this when

597
02:13:17,739 --> 02:13:48,060
you can't start from the edge. You have to be on top of it. This ain't like a brush tool in

598
02:13:48,060 --> 02:14:15,960
Photoshop, guys. It's not gonna do what I want it to do. Yeah, yeah. Okay, same thing over here.

599
02:14:17,079 --> 02:14:27,029
So it starts, curve begins here. I need a little more, but it goes like this.

600
02:14:27,029 --> 02:14:40,359
It's got to be up a little more. I'm gonna put some bushes here. You can't just skip

601
02:14:40,359 --> 02:15:00,039
all this shit. So this is way too much. I got a misleading line because the pixels

602
02:15:00,039 --> 02:15:05,880
are being deleted. All right, look it. Don't tell me I did that wrong when I had a clear

603
02:15:05,880 --> 02:15:39,220
line here that's being shaved as I step back. Right here. Right, almost there. I can,

604
02:15:39,220 --> 02:15:44,859
I can fix this. Don't worry, just watch. I'm gonna have to add some more in here.

605
02:15:46,489 --> 02:15:51,500
It's getting there. Look down and move backwards because it doesn't matter.

606
02:15:51,500 --> 02:15:57,460
Because if I move backwards from here, like this, it's already, I'm lined up. And if I

607
02:15:57,460 --> 02:16:04,460
move backwards from here, it's, there's no, it's not possible. Watch, I'll show you.

608
02:16:06,100 --> 02:16:10,100
Like I'm gonna start right here. Like I can't, there's no way, unless I have like an

609
02:16:10,100 --> 02:16:13,539
angle meter on my right hand side of my screen. I have no idea where I'm standing.

610
02:16:14,100 --> 02:16:18,659
So right here, if I step back, like see, I've already moved to the left.

611
02:16:19,300 --> 02:16:33,180
And I have to hold the mouse button down. So I, it's, it's going to move.

612
02:16:33,819 --> 02:16:43,000
There's no clear way to make sure I'm like on the plane.

613
02:16:43,639 --> 02:16:58,729
Plus CLA, it's like console aiming. No, you can't, it's no way. Like, no, it's not going to happen.

614
02:17:00,739 --> 02:17:13,659
Use the mini map. How do I do plus and minus on the mini map? I just did? No, I didn't.

615
02:17:13,659 --> 02:17:20,379
I did not just do that. It doesn't need to be perfect. Rome wasn't fucking perfect.

616
02:17:23,430 --> 02:17:27,510
They did, they did, they took their fucking time and like Rome was like kind of sloppy.

617
02:17:28,629 --> 02:17:39,139
Sloppy Rome was built in a few days. I need to add some here. There. I want it

618
02:17:39,139 --> 02:17:49,180
to be circle though. I'm not, cause it starts like here. Why did you, why are you stopping here?

619
02:17:50,180 --> 02:17:54,100
Why are you doing that? Why did you do that? Why didn't you just go forward?

620
02:17:56,870 --> 02:18:12,299
I hate that. Close enough. That's close enough. I can add a little bit right here.

621
02:18:21,690 --> 02:18:45,079
Got it. I did it. I did it. That's, that's good. Got it. Good. Okay. That's very close.

622
02:18:46,440 --> 02:18:51,930
It's like this hard line right here does not match up exactly with here. I mean, it kind

623
02:18:51,930 --> 02:18:59,190
of does. It's the same as when you started. No, it's not. It's a little different. What are you

624
02:18:59,190 --> 02:19:16,569
drinking? All right. So now we're going to dual color here. No, we're not. We're not going to do

625
02:19:16,569 --> 02:19:28,260
that. We're going to do bushes. I gotta go back to the garden setting. Let me do the bushes

626
02:19:28,260 --> 02:19:39,350
first. It's dumb. Looks like shit. Incredibly ugly. Like I would never have that in my

627
02:19:39,350 --> 02:20:32,469
house. Throw it in the trash. Is that all of them? No. Oh, that's a normie bush. How is that a

628
02:20:32,469 --> 02:20:43,739
normie bush? This is the shit that's in fucking Las Vegas. Normie bush? Is it a, no, this is a

629
02:20:43,739 --> 02:20:56,120
normie bush. Like one of these. The bush, a normie bush is a cloud that is colored green.

630
02:20:56,120 --> 02:21:13,370
That's a normie bush. Oh, I like these. I'm gonna, I'm gonna move these around.

631
02:21:13,370 --> 02:21:31,299
A couple of hostas. I feel like I want these to be a little bigger. I want something bigger

632
02:21:31,299 --> 02:21:52,120
here. Let me see. I need like a little bit bigger, but I still want it to be like desert

633
02:21:52,120 --> 02:22:06,260
Vegas style. Let's go down here. 0.5. I need like a couple of meters, I think. A palm tree.

634
02:22:07,079 --> 02:22:18,860
No, that'd be weird in your house. I could get a big one. Wait, hold on. Ooh, not bad. Let's

635
02:22:18,860 --> 02:22:35,700
see. No, that's not a big one. How about get these? No, this just looks like, this looks

636
02:22:36,180 --> 02:22:53,479
just like Canadian leaves. Oh, this is not Canada. No, maybe one of these. Creeping dense.

637
02:22:54,120 --> 02:23:14,620
These are trees. Dwarf shrub. No, these aren't bad. How big are these? I like that kind of

638
02:23:14,620 --> 02:23:28,149
greenish. Um, could go like here and then here and then have like a big one right here and

639
02:23:28,149 --> 02:23:47,450
a big one right here. These are the worst plants. All right, I need something bigger,

640
02:23:48,409 --> 02:23:58,459
large. Maybe a ball bush. No. Ooh, yeah. Yep. Mm hmm. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. These are everywhere

641
02:23:58,459 --> 02:24:03,379
out here. What color should it be? None of these. This is, this is good. Like kind of

642
02:24:03,379 --> 02:24:13,319
that little off green kind of like baby shit color. One here and maybe like one here.

643
02:24:13,319 --> 02:24:35,190
Let me just see. No, got to be a different color. I think I want a different color. I

644
02:24:35,190 --> 02:24:49,510
think I want a green. I'll get a couple of flowers in here too. Yeah, that's a good idea.

645
02:24:49,510 --> 02:24:51,590
I think I want to, I think I want to just straight up green though.

646
02:24:52,629 --> 02:24:57,129
Let me see what that looks like. If it looks any better. Move these out of the way.

647
02:24:58,409 --> 02:25:20,329
Oh man. Oh man. Man. Wait a minute here. Man. Wait. I'm not happy with the placement.

648
02:25:51,430 --> 02:26:02,100
Symmetrical house. What? I like symmetry with plants. This is a tutorial on rails

649
02:26:02,100 --> 02:26:18,200
arcade shooter house. What? What an insanely specific thing to say. Yeah. Can we make,

650
02:26:18,200 --> 02:26:25,909
we'll make a little pond here. Everyone likes to just talk shit. That looks stupid. That looks

651
02:26:25,909 --> 02:26:32,379
terrible. I think that's not even good. You should have this kind of plant and then you

652
02:26:32,379 --> 02:26:47,579
should bury that one in the sand. What an ugly display. You should see my display. It's

653
02:26:47,579 --> 02:27:12,700
marvelous. We unlocked a new voice. Nice. Power Ranger bad guy voice.

654
02:27:18,379 --> 02:27:42,149
Oh, that's fucking hilarious. It's true. That is a hundred percent correct. After 10,000 years,

655
02:27:42,149 --> 02:27:52,920
I'm free. It's time to conquer earth. Oh, I can plant it. These, these don't plant. Are

656
02:27:52,920 --> 02:28:04,520
these just sitting in the, okay. Do I not plant them? I guess they don't get planted.

657
02:28:07,260 --> 02:28:12,540
All right. Nice. Okay. Let's grab a flower or two, a nice desert flower because we're in

658
02:28:12,540 --> 02:28:32,969
the desert. We're not. Do Zordon. Power Rangers, it's me Zordon. There it is. That's all you can,

659
02:28:32,969 --> 02:28:41,780
that's all I can do. We can do like pots. That's cool. Matilda has landed on earth.

660
02:28:43,030 --> 02:28:56,360
She's trying to take it over. I can't believe that. What was his name? Ooh,

661
02:28:56,360 --> 02:29:16,920
I need a different color here though. No, this doesn't work. What idiot hired this

662
02:29:16,920 --> 02:29:20,920
landscaper? This idiot did. I hired this idiot landscaper because I'm the idiot that

663
02:29:20,920 --> 02:29:55,420
owns the idiot house. I can't place it. Oh, is it too, it's gotta be smaller. I need,

664
02:29:55,420 --> 02:30:10,649
I want it right here. Can I make it, is there a little one round shaped pond fountain? Should

665
02:30:10,649 --> 02:30:20,950
I just have like fucking fountains? Like up here, two fountains right when you walk in the

666
02:30:20,950 --> 02:30:40,520
front door. Yeah, I like it. I want a pond here. Actually, no, why would you have a pond

667
02:30:40,520 --> 02:30:49,719
at the front door? Should I just have a bunch of these? Like these things are cool. No, no,

668
02:30:49,719 --> 02:30:58,069
no. I'm blowing my whole budget at the front door. I think that looks nice. We need a pond,

669
02:30:58,069 --> 02:31:18,489
a little one. I want some flowers though. I need, um, stop the symmetry. What's wrong

670
02:31:18,489 --> 02:31:32,250
with symmetry? Are they cactus? I don't think they're a cactus. No, unfortunately no cactus.

671
02:31:32,250 --> 02:31:42,280
It's very old fashioned. There's something wrong with that. I think I want, I mean this looks

672
02:31:42,280 --> 02:31:49,020
like shit. You'd think it looks like shit because of this. The house needs work. You know,

673
02:31:49,020 --> 02:31:53,180
we'll go on inside out. There's a bug on me. No, there's not. Jesus Christ, I'm out of my

674
02:31:53,180 --> 02:32:01,739
mind. I'm something wrong with my brain. I'm losing my mind. I've lost my brain. It's gone.

675
02:32:01,739 --> 02:32:05,350
I don't have it anymore. My headphones touched me in the neck and I thought there was a

676
02:32:05,350 --> 02:32:15,879
scorpion on me. I don't do any drugs. I, I'm, I'm like sober. I'm, I don't understand.

677
02:32:16,520 --> 02:32:26,579
All right, I need to get rid of those because this just, this is bringing the whole thing down.

678
02:32:27,540 --> 02:32:31,000
I don't like the color on the outside either. We're doing, I'm doing a Vegas house.

679
02:32:32,819 --> 02:32:45,610
Vegas style. Can I not open the window from out here? To climb to the roof?

680
02:32:46,250 --> 02:32:57,690
How am I supposed to remove these? How do I get there? This, I think this is impossible.

681
02:33:04,420 --> 02:33:13,530
Uh, can I just reach them? Yeah, I can just reach them. Okay, so now there's no boarded up

682
02:33:13,530 --> 02:33:23,989
windows. I mean, it's ugly in here and the, I gotta get the outside. I'm, I'm either painting

683
02:33:23,989 --> 02:33:34,219
or I need, um, I need like that, like Adobe look. Let's see here. No, um, walls, right?

684
02:33:34,940 --> 02:33:55,739
It's too dark. Plaster bucket. No, wood brick. I mean, it's, that's not like

685
02:33:55,739 --> 02:34:14,629
wood though. You know what I mean? Like, no, that's not going to look right. Can I like,

686
02:34:19,049 --> 02:34:25,059
no, I'm not sure I can do it. This is the closest thing, but this is going to look really

687
02:34:25,059 --> 02:34:45,690
strange. Let me just see. Is he going to do what I asked for the past 50 minutes? What

688
02:34:45,690 --> 02:35:05,219
am I doing? He's doing it. What, what are we talking about? He's doing it. No, that's not

689
02:35:05,219 --> 02:35:24,059
going to look right. No, not 3d. It's gotta be that like beige kind of orange reds like this,

690
02:35:24,059 --> 02:35:39,399
but that's not correct. This is a floor tile. What about maybe paint? Let me check the paint.

691
02:35:40,340 --> 02:35:53,139
I'll try to paint it something. It's like this. Let me just see what happens when I do this.

692
02:35:53,780 --> 02:36:01,750
Although there are a lot of houses in, in, in like apartments and complexes that are

693
02:36:01,829 --> 02:36:38,180
this color. Let's see what this looks like. Wait a minute. That's no, uh, no, that's,

694
02:36:38,180 --> 02:36:56,500
that's good. I say it's got to be, no, it's not a flesh house. The walls just look like

695
02:36:56,500 --> 02:37:01,819
this stained. Well, I can't do the thing I want to do. How do you even have something on the

696
02:37:01,819 --> 02:37:11,620
outside? Why ceramic tiles classic green? Why can't I just pick the color? Why just,

697
02:37:11,620 --> 02:37:22,950
oh, we got a screen. Sorry. Only green wall panels. All we got is grandma paper and wood.

698
02:37:26,329 --> 02:37:45,620
I need like outside walls plaster. No plaster is, is to fill holes. Use ceramic. Yeah. But

699
02:37:45,620 --> 02:38:05,100
ceramic, these are, these are the floor. These are wall tiles. Yeah. They,

700
02:38:06,200 --> 02:38:21,350
this maybe is close enough. Ceramic orange. I'm going to try it. Drink the plaster. Okay.

701
02:38:21,350 --> 02:38:34,309
What's going to happen if I do that? Oh no, that's not good. I need a lighter than that.

702
02:38:36,069 --> 02:38:53,860
I can't, well, I can advise it only this one color. This might be it. I think I got it.

703
02:38:53,860 --> 02:39:12,739
No, Garfield house. No, this is, I got to get this right. This is important.

704
02:39:12,739 --> 02:39:25,700
The tiles are too small. What about this one? Like a light. This could be it.

705
02:39:25,700 --> 02:39:54,700
This could be close. Don't use ceramic on the exterior. Yeah. But I'm trying,

706
02:39:54,700 --> 02:39:59,620
I'm trying to find the closest thing to the house that I'm trying to make.

707
02:39:59,620 --> 02:40:06,149
It's either wood, ceramic or tile. Those are the only three materials that exist in this game.

708
02:40:08,569 --> 02:40:23,860
I have a way, do I want or brick? Yeah. But the brick just looks,

709
02:40:24,579 --> 02:40:32,889
this, this is like the pizza house again. I'm just going to lightly paint it,

710
02:40:32,889 --> 02:40:42,149
but what is this? What are these? What tiles are these? Which ones are these? I don't,

711
02:40:42,149 --> 02:41:01,860
I don't see these anywhere. What are these called? This is just a concrete slabs on the

712
02:41:01,860 --> 02:41:31,110
side of the house. It's a paving slab. Can you even paint over concrete? I wish there was like

713
02:41:31,110 --> 02:42:01,819
exterior walls, just brick. This is just this, these two colors of brick. It's hiding. No,

714
02:42:01,819 --> 02:42:18,469
package of panels, package of panels. And it's all these like Dracula walls.

715
02:42:18,469 --> 02:42:35,829
This is, I'm going to have to paint it. Yeah. This is a Dracula wall. That's the

716
02:42:35,829 --> 02:42:43,500
inside of Dracula's coffin. So is that. So is this. And so is this. All right. Let's see.

717
02:42:43,500 --> 02:42:50,739
Let's take a look at what these look like. This is, I think this is it.

718
02:42:50,739 --> 02:42:57,930
This is it. And I don't, it doesn't matter. This is what I'm using. This is close enough.

719
02:42:57,930 --> 02:43:18,549
Yeah. Close enough. House is not ruined. House is, it's going to look fine.

720
02:43:23,860 --> 02:43:51,850
Just wait. I'm making my desert getaway. You're not in the desert. Yes, I am. There's no,

721
02:43:51,850 --> 02:44:05,030
do you see any town symbols or anything here? I could be anywhere. I am where I choose to be.

722
02:44:05,030 --> 02:44:13,530
This is my fantasy. I can fantasize about wherever I want to be. It's the digital

723
02:44:13,610 --> 02:44:19,959
internet world. And I fantasize to be right in the same place that I currently am in right now.

724
02:44:19,959 --> 02:44:36,250
Pretty boring. It's coming together. It's coming together. I can already, I can,

725
02:44:36,250 --> 02:44:53,350
I know it. I already know what it looks like. Cheesecake flavored brick house.

726
02:44:55,559 --> 02:45:02,950
You guys are judgmental. What does, I wonder what your exterior walls look like.

727
02:45:02,950 --> 02:45:11,209
What does your house look like? And why is this here? Are these made out of like bleach?

728
02:45:11,209 --> 02:45:40,790
Why is it grass dead? Oh, better than your house. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep.

729
02:45:40,790 --> 02:45:45,559
Look up stone. Uh, and no, it's too late. This is, this is what the house,

730
02:45:45,559 --> 02:45:50,360
this is fine. Does it look nice? Once I get it all done, I think I need a stairway though

731
02:45:50,360 --> 02:46:15,299
to do this because I am not like 30 feet tall. No, this is, it's going to look nice.

732
02:46:18,420 --> 02:46:27,780
Don't crash. You're talking that you are 24, what? 24, what? 34, what do you mean?

733
02:46:31,670 --> 02:46:55,420
First of all, get all these napkins out of the way. Paint the windowsills dark. Yeah,

734
02:46:55,420 --> 02:47:01,450
the idea is I want to paint these like a, like a red, like a maroonish, like orange maroon.

735
02:47:22,229 --> 02:47:26,760
Yeah, like rust red. Yeah, that sounds good. See, you get it. You get it. You

736
02:47:26,760 --> 02:47:30,520
understand. You get like the, like, this is like a house in the desert. This is like

737
02:47:30,520 --> 02:47:54,889
Vegas, Arizona. You get it. God, VIP that guy. Shower tiles. All right. Shuttle down.

738
02:47:54,889 --> 02:48:05,020
Shuttle down. That in Arizona, where boomers go to retire and where sick fucking awesome

739
02:48:05,020 --> 02:48:10,219
dudes in their thirties go and have like a blast and have like tons of cool things to do and like

740
02:48:10,219 --> 02:48:40,379
cool fun days. Get rid of these fucking square hot dogs. I can't believe you guys are making

741
02:48:40,379 --> 02:48:48,659
fun of this and you wanted me to have the hot dog house. Okay. Well, just make sure we're

742
02:48:48,659 --> 02:48:53,540
clear on that. Pick that one. Pick that one. The hot dog house, like the grilled hot dog.

743
02:48:56,860 --> 02:49:23,379
Fine. Is it true that Americans eat whole butter bars as a snack?

744
02:49:24,100 --> 02:49:32,219
Um, I think I can answer this. I'm American here. I don't know what that is. What's a butter bar?

745
02:49:32,219 --> 02:49:37,610
I don't know what that is. I love how it's something I'm supposed to be eating as a snack

746
02:49:37,610 --> 02:49:53,020
and I've never heard of it before. Sorry. Is it a sardine? Is it I eat? Well, actually like

747
02:49:53,020 --> 02:50:04,700
no, like not fucking around. What is it? It's a stick of butter. I've never heard of that.

748
02:50:04,700 --> 02:50:13,180
A stick of butter. It's a bar of butter. I feel like this is some fantasy world made-up

749
02:50:13,180 --> 02:50:21,879
thing. I've never come across anyone in my entire life that's ever eaten a bar of a stick of butter

750
02:50:21,879 --> 02:50:49,239
for a snack. No fucking way. No way. I, yeah, no way. I agree. Okay. Yeah. I'm gonna paint this.

751
02:50:49,239 --> 02:51:04,120
Can I, can I paint these? I hope I can. Otherwise this is a pain in the ass. Okay. Looks

752
02:51:04,120 --> 02:51:19,750
good. The stray window is driving me crazy. Oh yeah. That is really weird. Yeah. This,

753
02:51:19,750 --> 02:51:24,950
but I also said this is weird but this is not weird. The stray window right there but like

754
02:51:24,950 --> 02:51:30,700
the back door and then the other back door. Two huge sliders that are right here. That's not

755
02:51:30,700 --> 02:52:02,440
strange and a window. What? That's not weird. This is not the garage. Garage to the backyard.

756
02:52:02,440 --> 02:52:08,709
No, the garage is right there. I'm gonna make that look real nice too. I'm telling you, this

757
02:52:08,709 --> 02:52:14,379
is a whole entire project and it's gonna look good. It's gonna look good and I want comparison

758
02:52:14,379 --> 02:52:29,129
photos. I, hopefully somebody took them. I didn't. Just get a ladder. They don't exist in this

759
02:52:29,129 --> 02:52:46,139
video game. Don't cut that. Gotta get up here. Sometimes you gotta do the tedious work.

760
02:52:46,780 --> 02:52:51,610
I'm not selling this house by the way. This is mine. Somebody wants to come take this from

761
02:52:51,610 --> 02:53:10,340
me? You'll have to take it from my cold, unused hands. I gotta go up. I gotta bring one

762
02:53:10,340 --> 02:53:28,120
of these with me. What the fuck? Oh. I was like, why is it bleached? No pictures? No,

763
02:53:28,120 --> 02:53:35,579
there's no pictures. I'm currently putting up new exterior walls. Sorry, there's no

764
02:53:35,579 --> 02:53:39,979
paintings on the wall yet. I'm not selling. Who's that person? I'm not selling to that person.

765
02:53:40,860 --> 02:53:57,989
Even if they're the top bidder. Okay. Kind of be impossible, isn't it? I actually am gonna

766
02:53:57,989 --> 02:54:12,040
have to build those stair things. Yeah, I am. I'm not gonna be looking at the last two or three.

767
02:54:18,010 --> 02:54:26,389
First of all, let me do this. Let's get a good rust color here. Copper coin. We'll try it.

768
02:54:29,459 --> 02:54:48,899
And then we'll also try biscuit. No, biscuit's too light. Cream. Raspberry. It's probably

769
02:54:48,899 --> 02:55:00,500
gonna be nice. The copper coin. Try pale pink. This is kind of like rust. Let's see. Let's

770
02:55:00,500 --> 02:55:30,329
see what this looks like out here. Oh no, that's not good. I can't paint these. Fuck.

771
02:55:30,329 --> 02:55:45,319
You can't do new windows either. There's no such thing. I can't like replace them.

772
02:55:48,549 --> 02:56:09,780
No. No, why? No, this does look bad because of the gray. Ah, fuck. If I could do a rust or a

773
02:56:09,780 --> 02:56:21,290
red, like a maroon, it would look so much better. Oh well. Too late. I'm just gonna have to do it.

774
02:56:21,290 --> 02:56:37,420
That's just the way it is. I can't paint these windows out here. No. That's unfortunate. Well,

775
02:56:39,319 --> 02:57:10,649
let's go ahead and do stairs so I can at least finish it. Why do I have to do this?

776
02:57:22,170 --> 02:57:39,590
Here we go again. No, I didn't even bring the damn things up here. How am I gonna do this?

777
02:57:39,670 --> 02:57:45,399
Oh, come on. I'm gonna do more ladder, ladder, ladder, ladder.

778
02:57:54,180 --> 02:58:22,500
This ladder's tiny. Gym ladder. That's not gonna work. This is so much higher.

779
02:58:22,500 --> 02:58:51,590
A scaffolding? I don't. No, I don't. What? Oh my god. You gotta be kidding me. I still need to...

780
02:58:51,590 --> 02:59:03,670
All right, give me the damn thing. Oh, what an eyesore. All right, I'm gonna tell you what I

781
02:59:03,670 --> 02:59:07,909
would do if this is my house. Do you see? I would just take one of these panels and flip

782
02:59:07,909 --> 02:59:31,540
it horizontal and cover the whole thing. Like, does it really matter? Bricks would be the wrong

783
02:59:31,540 --> 02:59:37,700
way. The customer wouldn't even know. I would get away with that in a heartbeat.

784
02:59:46,870 --> 02:59:50,389
What's going on up there? It looks like the bricks are the other way.

785
02:59:50,389 --> 02:59:53,750
No, that's just the sun. Reflection from the sun. Is it an optical illusion?

786
02:59:57,049 --> 03:00:00,409
That'd be a check, please. That's a check. I take checks only.

787
03:00:00,969 --> 03:00:18,229
Actually, I'm just kidding. I take cash only. All right. Well, I can't do the thing I

788
03:00:18,229 --> 03:00:25,770
wanted to do. What happened here? Is the grass growing through the rocks?

789
03:00:30,260 --> 03:01:02,459
Why is that happening? What is going on here? There's nothing even there. All right, let's do

790
03:01:02,459 --> 03:01:16,520
this. Can I just get bricks? I don't think I can do brick. I can... No, I can't.

791
03:01:17,239 --> 03:01:53,479
Maybe this. That's kind of huge though. No, that's absurd. Let's see. Like,

792
03:01:55,139 --> 03:02:29,979
stone. These ones. Herringbone. Oh, wait a minute. Okay, hold on. Nice. Hold on. No,

793
03:02:29,979 --> 03:02:39,940
that's got to be a different color. They're huge, too. They're really big. Like, too big.

794
03:02:40,500 --> 03:02:52,459
What we got in colors in here? These are just gold bars. No, that's very out of place.

795
03:02:52,459 --> 03:03:38,059
That's better, but... Which way should it be facing? I would rent. Use bricks? There are

796
03:03:38,059 --> 03:03:50,709
no bricks. I can't lay bricks down. It's only these. But look, it's like a stack of them.

797
03:03:52,219 --> 03:04:33,770
That doesn't work. Look at this stuff. I can make it do stones. I can do this. This doesn't

798
03:04:33,770 --> 03:05:11,190
look terrible. I feel like I should flip that. That just looks like this. Let me just see.

799
03:05:11,909 --> 03:05:46,549
This needs to be a different color, then. That actually doesn't look bad. I don't hate this.

800
03:05:46,549 --> 03:06:07,399
That doesn't look bad. Hold on here. This looks okay. Was it like this? A little bit over the edge?

801
03:06:08,760 --> 03:06:20,579
Was it in a little bit more? That's not matching up. That's not matching up. I'm going to freak

802
03:06:20,579 --> 03:06:31,850
out. I'm going to freak out. It's not matching up. It needs to be in a little more. It needs

803
03:06:31,850 --> 03:06:59,000
to come in like a half an inch. Now, what do I do here? I can't just do that again. It'll

804
03:06:59,000 --> 03:07:12,889
look awkward, won't it? No, I can't do this trick more than once. A couple of stones. Maybe

805
03:07:12,889 --> 03:07:28,700
some rocks? Maybe some bigger stones? Like a plant bed, maybe? Let's see what looks like with

806
03:07:28,700 --> 03:07:48,790
rocks. Okay, rock. No, I don't. What are you doing? Big stones? Stepping stone? Chopped? No.

807
03:07:48,790 --> 03:07:55,260
Stepping stone? Chopped? Small? This is kind of an erratic pattern. How big is it? Oh,

808
03:07:55,260 --> 03:08:26,469
bigger than ice crystals. Let's see what this looks like. Smaller and a little darker. Can

809
03:08:26,469 --> 03:08:42,889
I make them? How about this one? Hold on. Wait. Hold on. This is important. Should I do

810
03:08:42,889 --> 03:09:01,209
them spread out or should I have them kind of right in the line? No, that's ugly. I think I

811
03:09:01,209 --> 03:09:32,889
need more stone. I need like something. I need pebble? Wait a minute. Why are these different

812
03:09:32,889 --> 03:10:07,879
colors? Just put rocks all over the whole yard? I need like a flower bed. No, no, no.

813
03:10:07,879 --> 03:10:36,299
Everybody, I got it. I'm going to just make a line of flowers. I wish this was even 20%

814
03:10:36,379 --> 03:11:28,139
smaller. Poo. I think I can just hide it with a couple of little bushes. Twix bar. You guys,

815
03:11:28,139 --> 03:11:33,260
it's so judgmental. Now I'm going to do some small bushes. A line of small bushes.

816
03:11:33,260 --> 03:11:50,389
How big are these? Some orange? That might not look terrible. These are huge though.

817
03:11:50,389 --> 03:12:04,170
I'll put one of these. Yeah, there are no cactuses in the game, unfortunately.

818
03:12:05,260 --> 03:12:22,170
They do not exist. When these are in the ground. No, they need to be smaller. They're

819
03:12:22,250 --> 03:13:20,600
too overbearing. I think I'm just going to say, fuck it. Here we go. Got it. Along the whole

820
03:13:20,600 --> 03:13:38,760
thing. Let's just see how these look at first. Hold on. All right. Yeah, I'll take care of the

821
03:13:38,760 --> 03:13:55,000
corner. I just want to make sure this looks all right. Yeah, this will be all right. Looks

822
03:13:55,000 --> 03:14:17,670
better than the rocks. Yeah, it does. Yeah, that looks fine. No, that's bright enough here.

823
03:14:18,229 --> 03:14:30,280
Leave the holes and see if anything else gets planted. Like, wow, my time off. It's like,

824
03:14:30,280 --> 03:14:36,440
I'll see you later. I'm going to see what happens. I think I know. All right. And then

825
03:14:36,440 --> 03:14:45,350
we're going to do one big bush here. One big bush here. Different bushes though. So the

826
03:14:45,350 --> 03:14:53,780
symmetrical people that don't like the symmetrical stuff. You know, they'll have some say in this.

827
03:14:54,420 --> 03:15:14,069
Spray hose and hose. Ah, we already did that yesterday. We did that joke already.

828
03:15:14,069 --> 03:15:23,420
Just get rid of the shitty gravel. I like the gravel. I like the stone. I like it.

829
03:15:25,159 --> 03:15:29,079
Once there's a bush over here and a bush over there, it'll look a lot nicer. I like it.

830
03:15:33,850 --> 03:15:41,459
I like, um, stone. You don't like stone?

831
03:15:48,149 --> 03:16:11,319
Raisins. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That was for the guy that said to do that. All right. Hey,

832
03:16:12,420 --> 03:16:20,170
look at that. We need something little right there. Something little right here.

833
03:16:21,940 --> 03:16:26,739
Something big. Something big. And then we'll let the front door will be done. And we only

834
03:16:26,739 --> 03:16:40,250
have like another fucking entire five acres to do. Okay. I'm going something big, large,

835
03:16:41,139 --> 03:17:18,940
very large. Oh, fuck. Yeah. Oh, fucking hell. Yeah. I always did it. Oh, fucking hell. Yeah.

836
03:17:22,149 --> 03:17:53,350
Look, we got up. We got down. It looks fucking dumb. LOL.

837
03:17:58,920 --> 03:18:15,670
All right. Thanks. I think it looks cool. I'm not even done. You think I'm done.

838
03:18:15,670 --> 03:18:25,059
I'm not even close to being done. Now we're going to get some more, uh, kind of like,

839
03:18:25,059 --> 03:18:31,319
like almost pinkish, like, like in some way in between orange and, um, and red, right here,

840
03:18:32,360 --> 03:18:44,950
right here, right here, right here. Let's go plants.

841
03:18:51,690 --> 03:19:02,069
I wish I could change the color. Oh, I think so. Oh, I think so. These are the same color

842
03:19:02,069 --> 03:19:28,040
of these. Damn it. Nevermind. Wait a minute. Oh no. Should I? Is this, is this too much?

843
03:19:28,680 --> 03:20:39,540
This might be too much. This is too much. Too much. Is that too much? Too much. Yeah,

844
03:20:39,540 --> 03:20:53,319
it is. Oh, you dickhead. Why? Now something has to go there. I'm almost done. Just need

845
03:20:53,319 --> 03:20:59,690
little flower. Just something small. Something little. Something that really just brings it

846
03:20:59,690 --> 03:21:07,930
all together. Like one of these. Get in there. Come on. Get right in there.

847
03:21:27,239 --> 03:21:32,549
I might not even need it. I might not need it. I think I'm done with the front here.

848
03:21:32,549 --> 03:21:53,420
I need to put something a little over there. Uh, what do I? I don't, I have no idea. These,

849
03:21:53,979 --> 03:21:59,989
I don't, I don't know. I don't know what these are. Now that's too,

850
03:21:59,989 --> 03:22:51,780
wait, hold on. I just got lost for a second. Hold on. Tree. Spherical tree. Plum tree.

851
03:22:52,420 --> 03:23:03,030
Maybe one big tree on the right over here. Just a huge tree. A very big one. Like one

852
03:23:03,030 --> 03:23:22,139
of these huge ones. Oh, that's enormous. No, that's a, that's a good giant pineapple in my house.

853
03:23:22,139 --> 03:23:44,520
Small. It's got to be smaller than that. Here we go. That's better. Right here? That dumb tree

854
03:23:44,520 --> 03:24:03,559
wasn't there. Start a riot. Our palm tree isn't here. Hey, relax. You already have one. No,

855
03:24:03,559 --> 03:24:07,909
we need to have like a walkway going over here to the right. Yeah, there's nothing over here.

856
03:24:07,909 --> 03:24:15,379
There's going to be like the walkway. Um, I don't know. No, this would be like a little,

857
03:24:15,379 --> 03:24:24,280
little pool or something. I don't know. How about a rich person fountain? Something ridiculous,

858
03:24:24,280 --> 03:24:39,940
like right here. A projector to the house. Outdoor cinema screen. A fire pit. That's go,

859
03:24:39,940 --> 03:24:46,629
that goes in the back. No, Jeremy. No, that goes in the back. I'm sorry. Okay. Front,

860
03:24:46,629 --> 03:24:55,700
I thought it was front yard. No, it's backyard. Okay. How about, um, playground,

861
03:24:55,700 --> 03:25:08,569
but I don't have any kids. Swing center is very homey, but no, no kids. Recreation,

862
03:25:08,569 --> 03:25:27,100
accessories, fire pits, hammocks, maybe. Back it up. Decorations. Japanese lantern.

863
03:25:27,739 --> 03:26:06,180
Which do you prefer? On the outside or on right on the, on the inside or in the gravel here?

864
03:26:06,180 --> 03:26:16,840
Number one, number two or number three? That'll give you a good view. I'm seeing a lot of

865
03:26:16,840 --> 03:26:36,180
threes. That's all right. Looks like it's going to be three. How many, how many steps?

866
03:26:37,370 --> 03:27:03,819
Like here? One, two, three, four, five or four? You're going to want to fucking come to my

867
03:27:03,819 --> 03:27:31,620
house. Uneven, uneven. Fuck. You don't want to come to my smelly house? There's nothing in here

868
03:27:31,620 --> 03:27:42,620
yet. It doesn't, how could you tell it smells like anything? Come on game. What are you doing?

869
03:27:42,620 --> 03:28:10,229
Why can I not play? Am I standing on it? Huh? Straight down. There we go. I can just do it

870
03:28:10,229 --> 03:28:18,020
like that. Everyone's going to want to come to my house. I can already just see the invitations

871
03:28:18,020 --> 03:28:49,430
I send out. BYOB. God damn it. This is wrong. Um, it's not wrong. Which one of these is wrong?

872
03:28:49,430 --> 03:29:25,180
This one? That's that one. It's these two. How do I turn them on? Yeah. Oh, I'm so fucking happy.

873
03:29:25,180 --> 03:29:43,989
I actually don't mind this, but it needs to move. This, this tree right here is really

874
03:29:43,989 --> 03:29:49,450
fucking it all up. You know what I mean? This doesn't look right because of the tree.

875
03:29:54,229 --> 03:30:05,799
It looks better. Your front lawn is going to have so many bugs. Unfortunately, I have to

876
03:30:05,799 --> 03:30:19,959
patch that up. So the thing is you're missing pizza ovens. This is the one, right? No,

877
03:30:19,959 --> 03:30:30,870
it's bigger stone. Wait, that is the big one. Why does this look so odd? Oh, there we go.

878
03:30:30,870 --> 03:30:36,309
We're good. Any of the little patches I need to do? Maybe come out a little too,

879
03:30:36,309 --> 03:30:42,469
just like to make it so it's more natural here. Right on the edge. Maybe have this

880
03:30:42,469 --> 03:30:50,579
come out here a little more. Like here and then go out and around. Hear me out.

881
03:30:52,059 --> 03:31:50,819
I fucked it up. Saved it. No, I didn't. Fuck. Can I crouch? No, why? Oh, god damn it. Well,

882
03:31:50,819 --> 03:32:10,409
whatever. At least I can clean it up now. That looks natural now. Yeah, and then I

883
03:32:10,409 --> 03:32:14,549
can just put that one here and hide the bullshit that I just did. What was the name

884
03:32:14,549 --> 03:32:21,610
of this thing? What are these called? I forget. Go back up into the sky. That was funny.

885
03:32:23,750 --> 03:32:31,430
What were those things called? These? What were they? No, I have like a palm tree garden in the

886
03:32:31,430 --> 03:33:07,530
back. Anyone remember what those were called? What were those called? You had to plant them,

887
03:33:07,530 --> 03:33:13,930
right? What were those things called? Not these. I think it was at the top. I think

888
03:33:13,930 --> 03:33:30,520
I had it already. Spring? Damn it. What the hell are these called? Spreading bush?

889
03:33:34,059 --> 03:33:42,180
You got it. I think that's the one, right? Yeah, this is correct. Let's get this in a good spot,

890
03:33:42,180 --> 03:34:05,899
though. I'm thinking like right here. There. These are like not even. There's like a little

891
03:34:05,899 --> 03:34:18,899
too much space here. This is a retirement drug den. That's not the same thing. That's not

892
03:34:18,899 --> 03:34:28,379
even the same bush. That is not correct. And it looks very close. Is it? Is that the same

893
03:34:28,379 --> 03:34:48,969
thing? No, this one's not the same thing. This is called Acer palmatum. Is there another color?

894
03:34:50,250 --> 03:35:15,770
It is this one. All right. Now that we have the front front pretty much done,

895
03:35:16,409 --> 03:35:25,739
I would call this is pretty close to like nice garden, dude. I need something right here,

896
03:35:25,739 --> 03:35:33,850
though. Like nice job, man, is what I would say to the person that made this if they were

897
03:35:33,850 --> 03:35:55,940
in the ninth grade. Columns? Pond. That would be good, yeah. One of these ones. Let's make it

898
03:35:55,940 --> 03:36:07,770
a good color. Which way? Facing how? Facing around the tree, I think. That would be kind

899
03:36:07,770 --> 03:36:15,579
of nice, right? And maybe put something next to it. It's a hot tub. This is not a hot tub.

900
03:36:17,750 --> 03:36:24,229
I think right up here against this tree. And if you don't like it, you can just go watch

901
03:36:24,229 --> 03:36:40,120
another stream. You know what I'm saying? How long is it going to take to dig? All right,

902
03:36:40,120 --> 03:36:56,379
then. Making a skate park? Oh, you actually have to fill it with water? I thought it was rain. The

903
03:36:56,379 --> 03:37:06,219
pond was mounted and filled. Just kidding. All right. Now this is bad because this needs to be

904
03:37:06,219 --> 03:37:14,100
like bigger. There needs to be something around it. This is how it starts. Now I know what

905
03:37:14,100 --> 03:37:23,500
gardening is like. Now the tree fucked it all up. It needs to be bigger. I'm going to do

906
03:37:23,500 --> 03:37:45,209
the big one. Dude, if that fucking tree wasn't here. If that tree wasn't here, this is

907
03:37:45,209 --> 03:37:57,370
perfect. I can go this way. Yeah, but I don't want to put it here, though. People will drive

908
03:37:57,370 --> 03:38:02,579
by and throw cigarette butts in here. You know how many baseballs are going to go in here?

909
03:38:02,579 --> 03:38:17,850
It can't be this close. No, it's got to be the smaller ones. Um, there's this one,

910
03:38:17,850 --> 03:38:35,909
though. What does this one look like? This one's okay. It's cool looking. Yeah.

911
03:38:40,219 --> 03:38:47,270
Shit. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Do not go into here. Remove, please. Please

912
03:38:47,270 --> 03:39:05,000
remove. Cancel. Cancel, please. I just want something to like be right here or something.

913
03:39:05,000 --> 03:39:18,920
Hold on. How's that look? Could put something right here. Let me just see what it looks like.

914
03:39:22,309 --> 03:39:44,549
Yeah, I can't delete the tree. It's there forever. That's not bad. Wait a second. Wait

915
03:39:44,549 --> 03:40:13,850
a minute. Oh, this is just, hold on. Can I? Can you connect them? No, you can't connect

916
03:40:13,850 --> 03:40:21,139
them. It's going to be right here. I'll put like another fucking tree or bush over here.

917
03:40:21,940 --> 03:40:30,489
That's okay. I'm okay with that. We'll put like a little something. I need like enough

918
03:40:30,489 --> 03:40:53,049
space to walk this way though. That is enough room. All right. Um, what do I, what goes over

919
03:40:53,049 --> 03:40:58,090
here? How about a big, huge pond like right here? No, that's too much. That's even more pond than

920
03:40:58,090 --> 03:41:19,370
house. Uh, do, do more pond. A huge fountain. Paris fountain. I'm going to put a couple of

921
03:41:19,370 --> 03:41:27,399
little shrubs like here and like one here and here. Um, can we get like a preliminary

922
03:41:27,399 --> 03:41:43,940
screenshot here? Just real quick. That looks pretty nice. Something nice. Something cool.

923
03:41:43,940 --> 03:41:54,819
Something interesting. Something daring. A giant gnome. I'll put him here. He belongs over here

924
03:41:59,829 --> 03:42:13,559
in the pool, in the water. There's a little spot back here. That's cute right here. Yeah,

925
03:42:13,559 --> 03:43:20,020
I think so. Sculptures. Wait a minute. You can sit on the rocks. You can sit down on the

926
03:43:20,020 --> 03:43:36,280
rock. Just chill. Hold on. Move this one a little bit over here. Put something right in the middle.

927
03:43:36,280 --> 03:44:05,780
Got a little seat rock. What do you mean no one will do that? You wouldn't sit on that?

928
03:44:05,780 --> 03:44:47,459
They're drinking out of the pond. Put a god damn tire swing. Hold on. By the way,

929
03:44:47,459 --> 03:44:59,000
half the shit's gonna get stolen. Someone's gonna walk up here and just fucking take these.

930
03:44:59,000 --> 03:45:02,520
That's why I would never have like something like this. Someone would just reach over

931
03:45:02,520 --> 03:45:16,219
the fence and take it and walk away. Need to get a juped up security system. This is so

932
03:45:16,219 --> 03:45:22,149
cute. Look at how nice this looks. Look at that. Don't take a picture yet.

933
03:45:29,209 --> 03:45:36,899
That doesn't look good. That was like your mother came over to give her a tour of your new place

934
03:45:37,540 --> 03:45:42,809
and everything looks so nice and pretty and you cleaned up but for some reason something,

935
03:45:42,809 --> 03:45:48,729
a coin drops on the ground and it rolls underneath the couch and you have the panic

936
03:45:48,729 --> 03:45:57,590
attack where she's gonna look under the couch and she's like oh let me get that coin. No,

937
03:45:57,590 --> 03:46:01,750
don't. I'll get it and you try to race her to get the coin. Everything's in slow motion

938
03:46:01,750 --> 03:46:05,350
and she finds all the dirt that you sweep under the couch because you don't feel like

939
03:46:05,350 --> 03:46:21,930
putting it in the trash and all the porn DVDs that you sweep under the couch.

940
03:46:22,489 --> 03:46:50,309
I could make a whole D&D game. Pour out the water. Like the birds are fine. Can I paint

941
03:46:50,309 --> 03:46:55,579
them? I think the front yard is done. I do. Maybe we'll come back and clean it up a little bit.

942
03:46:58,200 --> 03:47:08,920
Wait, most importantly, come on. Looks like a welcome mat. This is the worst game on Steam.

943
03:47:10,010 --> 03:47:28,680
I think so. All right. Furniture. Wait a minute. Just a mat. Wait. Look at these.

944
03:47:29,479 --> 03:47:49,899
Come on. You tell me I'm not gonna have these too. That's in the way. Something's

945
03:47:49,899 --> 03:47:59,940
gonna be like right here. It's looking a little too busy. Is it? You think so? Yeah,

946
03:47:59,940 --> 03:48:03,540
you know, it is getting a little busy. It's getting busy. It's getting a little too busy.

947
03:48:04,340 --> 03:48:11,030
You are right. Yeah, this is getting busy. This is getting very busy. Yeah,

948
03:48:11,030 --> 03:48:18,489
this is becoming, this is becoming a hotel lobby busy. All right. Yeah, hold on.

949
03:48:18,489 --> 03:48:40,790
Too many rocks. I like them. I like them. I really do. I really do like these. I like

950
03:48:40,790 --> 03:49:15,739
them a lot. Did I move, did I fuck it up by moving that? Maybe. No, put it back. No, no.

951
03:49:15,739 --> 03:49:25,370
Doesn't work. No, you can sit over here. So what do we got on this side? Oh, Jesus. I don't want to

952
03:49:25,370 --> 03:49:30,860
look at that. All my fucking socks and my dirt and my porn DVDs. No, I only want my mother to

953
03:49:30,860 --> 03:49:46,469
see the hotel lobby. It's a dump back there. Yeah, right now it is. Look at how much work

954
03:49:46,469 --> 03:49:58,979
there is to do. The stream's never gonna turn off. It's all right, guys. I, I ate sardines

955
03:49:58,979 --> 03:50:07,860
today. They actually get, they literally, literally give you superpowers. They think I'm

956
03:50:07,860 --> 03:50:14,809
making that up. That's not a joke. I'm not making a joke. They actually give you superpowers. It's

957
03:50:14,809 --> 03:50:44,489
real. Start eating them. I'm serious. Mole? No, that's not a mole. Where's the mole? Is these

958
03:50:44,489 --> 03:51:08,440
mole tracks? All mole mounds are gone. Mole's gone. Mole's gone. We're fine. It is so easy

959
03:51:08,440 --> 03:51:18,020
to eat too. I would take a sardine sponsorship. I probably would. The only sponsorship you

960
03:51:18,020 --> 03:51:35,930
would ever see on this channel would be for like sardine cans. Ever have them on crackers?

961
03:51:35,930 --> 03:51:39,129
I have not. I've had it on toast though. Wow, that's what a great idea. I can't wait to do that

962
03:51:39,129 --> 03:51:56,870
tomorrow. Streamer ate sardines once and is now hooked for life. Like today. They give you

963
03:51:56,870 --> 03:52:06,309
superpowers. I had them today. What a placebo effect. I could do anything. I think I could,

964
03:52:06,309 --> 03:52:13,190
I think I could probably fly. Do not get up there. No, I had sardines today, man. I

965
03:52:13,430 --> 03:53:03,110
think I can do it. You versus the guy she told you not to care about. He's losing it. It was

966
03:53:03,110 --> 03:53:10,540
already gone before you got here. Don't worry. What else? There's a lot of weeds over here.

967
03:53:11,180 --> 03:53:33,700
It's hard to get around these trees. Speaking of trees, why can I sell these ones but I

968
03:53:33,700 --> 03:53:58,659
can't get rid of the huge annoying ones that are all over the place in the ground? Well,

969
03:53:58,659 --> 03:54:13,129
it's almost clean and mowed almost. Do a sardine review? I already did. I've been doing it every

970
03:54:13,129 --> 03:54:35,290
hour. I've already done that. Let's make this side of a house a swamp. What brand do I get?

971
03:54:37,639 --> 03:54:52,059
The one with the guy that looks like Dr. Roker. Yes, somebody did say that. Why would

972
03:54:52,059 --> 03:55:05,420
I even say that? We're 100% clean as of right... No, not yet. Hold on. Hold that

973
03:55:05,420 --> 03:55:27,930
thought. You have to eat a sardine and show your superpowers. Are these dog bowls considered...

974
03:55:28,489 --> 03:55:39,420
Is this considered dirty? I know. You just deleted the dog house. The dog house.

975
03:55:40,219 --> 03:55:45,930
What about the dog? Don't worry. I knew it. I told you. I'm just going to put down

976
03:55:45,930 --> 03:55:53,579
grass here and put the dog park back. I knew that was going to happen. You can't ever

977
03:55:53,739 --> 03:56:09,270
delete a dog house on stream. Yes. Yeah, I think so. I do. It needs a door. That's what's missing.

978
03:56:20,659 --> 03:57:30,020
White? Why is this so fat? This doesn't look right. Why is this too big? Hey, and then that...

979
03:57:30,020 --> 03:57:52,059
Hold on. It's not done yet. Stop screaming at me. It's not done. I can't do that.

980
03:57:52,940 --> 03:58:20,729
Now it's a home. Except for the left, back, and right side of the house.

981
03:58:21,370 --> 03:58:30,260
What am I gonna do over here? I gotta have something fun over here. Definitely gonna have

982
03:58:30,260 --> 03:58:39,610
like a barbecue section. Do a roller coaster. Make the dog park. I could have a little dog

983
03:58:39,610 --> 03:58:44,250
park over here. Yeah, I'll have like a little separate dog place. Hold on. There's definitely

984
03:58:44,250 --> 03:59:31,049
trash everywhere in here. Is there a car? The house comes with a car. I just want a car

985
03:59:31,049 --> 03:59:48,659
in here. They got a pool table? They got a ball pit. That's too small. All right. One step at a

986
03:59:48,659 --> 04:00:02,709
time. I need to do the rest of the paneling in the house. I gotta fix this dumb, stupid idea

987
04:00:02,709 --> 04:00:18,379
that I had and I should be reprimanded for it. What the hell was this called? It was a panel.

988
04:00:34,420 --> 04:00:47,219
We must riot for a ball pit. You want me to put a ball pit in the garage? Now I know the

989
04:00:47,219 --> 04:00:56,040
scaffold. I know, I know. I'm just gonna do the bottom first. This doesn't look right. Yeah,

990
04:00:56,040 --> 04:01:12,700
it's the same one. This place isn't even dirty. I bet the outside was, but thankfully the inside

991
04:01:12,700 --> 04:01:23,940
is nice. We can do some decorating. We can have, look, the outside, I'll make a separate

992
04:01:23,940 --> 04:01:32,040
little circus area. Everything's gonna be fine. I'm telling you, this is the big house. This

993
04:01:32,040 --> 04:01:39,930
is the one to go all in. I went all in. This stream will not stop until it's all done.

994
04:01:40,010 --> 04:01:49,049
All in. I, I'm going all in at the fucking table, dude. I've got 36 bucks at that table.

995
04:01:49,690 --> 04:01:54,729
All in. Everybody at the table is gonna be like, oh that's a lot. What the hell is he thinking?

996
04:01:55,450 --> 04:02:25,350
You and your gambling fantasies. You know, I mean, dude, I was thinking,

997
04:02:25,989 --> 04:02:32,309
I'm thinking I'm getting a tat. Seven on one eyelid, seven on the other eyelid,

998
04:02:33,110 --> 04:02:39,110
and seven on the top of my tongue. So I'll just close my eyes, stick my tongue out and

999
04:02:39,110 --> 04:03:07,579
be like, ding, ding, ding, motherfucker. I mean, the efficiency is just off the fucking charts

1000
04:03:07,579 --> 04:03:15,190
right now. You can tell that there was some type of fish based nutrients that he took today.

1001
04:03:16,069 --> 04:03:36,069
This is fucking up the grass though. That's annoying.

1002
04:03:45,780 --> 04:03:54,139
Tiles look weird. You should do brick or stucco. Um, I think it may be far too late

1003
04:03:54,139 --> 04:03:58,780
to change this now. These aren't tiles. They're panels. They're wall panels.

1004
04:03:59,500 --> 04:04:14,969
Are these tiles in this wall panel? These aren't bathroom tiles. Yeah, just these are pine panels.

1005
04:04:15,530 --> 04:04:21,370
Yeah, this is fine. I'm not doing this again. This is like a long time. It takes a while to

1006
04:04:21,370 --> 04:04:33,059
do this. Damn it. I know people are gonna give me shit for doing the double dare technique,

1007
04:04:34,100 --> 04:04:37,860
and it's like running back and forth, placing, run back over here, get some more milk,

1008
04:04:37,860 --> 04:04:43,879
run over here, put it inside their hat with the eggs. I know, but I'm just trying to get

1009
04:04:43,879 --> 04:05:02,250
this done. Still on this house. I'll be on this house until the stream turns off. That is a fact.

1010
04:05:03,049 --> 04:05:14,600
I mean, that is 100% truth, but it's going to be the greatest thing I've ever done in this game.

1011
04:05:15,319 --> 04:05:19,260
It's going to be really well done. We're not going to put like a Best Buy in here.

1012
04:05:20,059 --> 04:05:25,430
It's going to be a beautiful, fantastic, actually made house with a wonderful garden,

1013
04:05:25,430 --> 04:05:30,870
wonderful backyard play area, patio with a barbecue, a small circus, not a big one,

1014
04:05:30,870 --> 04:05:39,219
a small circus, a dog park, and maybe a gym. It's going to be a fun, it's going to be a regular

1015
04:05:39,219 --> 04:06:09,430
just house. All right, slow down. I'm going too fast. Still going to make a hot topic?

1016
04:06:11,190 --> 04:06:31,260
No, not this time. Okay, almost getting there. Phew! It's hard work. It's hard work pretending

1017
04:06:31,260 --> 04:06:52,969
to do hard work. Don't you guys think? Now we need this scaffolding after this,

1018
04:06:52,969 --> 04:06:59,030
and it could be the other side too. This house is too big. How many rooms are in this house?

1019
04:06:59,750 --> 04:07:06,010
Look at this. What is this all for? Why is there brick over here? Okay, so this,

1020
04:07:06,010 --> 04:07:11,049
what is this supposed to be? What is this room? Here's the front door. Got a nice garden,

1021
04:07:11,049 --> 04:07:21,879
but you know, okay, front door, the closet, the den, the closet where you hang your coats

1022
04:07:21,879 --> 04:07:29,899
and shoe rack or I don't know. And then this looks like it could just be a big living room.

1023
04:07:29,899 --> 04:07:39,610
Now what is this? Second weird brick room. This is not a bedroom. Bathroom? What would

1024
04:07:39,610 --> 04:07:48,139
he, what the hell would, why would there be brick? All right, up here. This house sucks.

1025
04:07:49,100 --> 04:08:01,319
There's no rooms. It's just, there's two brick rooms. I'm going to have to build out some

1026
04:08:01,319 --> 04:08:14,120
bedrooms. You build the room, smart guy. Yeah, but this, what, look at the weird layout here.

1027
04:08:14,120 --> 04:08:21,829
Everybody has a balcony? Up the stairs, balcony. Whose balcony is this? Just a balcony. And then

1028
04:08:21,829 --> 04:08:36,200
there's another balcony. You got too many balconies. I want to in fact remove this balcony

1029
04:08:36,920 --> 04:08:47,190
and turn it into a circus. That's more normal than this. Now front balconies, I, no, I don't

1030
04:08:47,190 --> 04:08:58,329
think so. No front balcony. Don't think so. No, no, no, no, no, no. This is how you get sniped in

1031
04:08:58,329 --> 04:09:22,940
Hitman. I, nope. We can make it work. I'll make it work. Don't worry. Yeah, that's where like the

1032
04:09:22,940 --> 04:09:29,510
target comes and smokes a cigarette for 15 seconds and that's your opportunity. All right,

1033
04:09:29,510 --> 04:09:47,180
what were we doing over here? Your power's been off for two hours. That's not good.

1034
04:09:50,700 --> 04:09:55,180
Oh, let's get a reveal. Hold on. I need to get a big reveal. Somebody just came back after

1035
04:09:55,180 --> 04:10:02,280
two hours. They weren't here. You ready for this? Okay. That one person that's here, you

1036
04:10:02,280 --> 04:10:07,399
ready? They just came back. Take a look at this. You remember what it looked like before,

1037
04:10:07,399 --> 04:10:24,459
before you left. Take a look at it now. And it's not even done. There's still much to be done.

1038
04:10:30,760 --> 04:10:41,750
Ah, I love it. All right, for real, I left when you were doing the Jenga thing. I came back and

1039
04:10:41,750 --> 04:10:51,979
it looks great. See? Yeah, thank you. Yes. Ah, welcome back. Hopefully the power situation.

1040
04:10:53,579 --> 04:11:10,920
So, under control. Yeah, we're gonna do something fun over here. We're gonna do like

1041
04:11:11,479 --> 04:11:31,239
a circus maybe. That's a paid actor. We should build something. Build Jenga. Wait a minute.

1042
04:11:31,239 --> 04:12:07,510
Is there actual drop in the game? No, they're not the same pieces. They can't fit. It has

1043
04:12:07,510 --> 04:12:28,860
to be two. It's not real Jenga. Unless there's three. Yeah, sorry guys. It's not real. It'll

1044
04:12:28,860 --> 04:12:35,239
never be real. Well, let's just see what happens. Well, there is no drop. What am

1045
04:12:35,239 --> 04:12:55,500
I talking about? One floated in the air for like 35 minutes. How do you play Jenga with

1046
04:12:55,500 --> 04:13:21,180
two rows? Yeah, you don't. That's what I'm saying. The panels can drop. Does it reach?

1047
04:13:21,180 --> 04:13:29,000
Can't stack them though. I don't think they can be stacked on top of each other.

1048
04:13:29,000 --> 04:13:42,790
No, sorry. Theory busted. Paint the top half of the house. That would look pretty odd.

1049
04:14:00,620 --> 04:14:12,549
Two-toned house. How's the um, how's the internet been? Looks like I haven't

1050
04:14:12,549 --> 04:14:18,659
dropped very many frames. I mean, I still have, but I've dropped like 3,500? Seems

1051
04:14:18,659 --> 04:14:26,860
like it's all right. At least for today. Maybe um, maybe it's more manageable now that we have the

1052
04:14:27,420 --> 04:14:33,540
new DNS and new static IP. Well, that would be really swell if that were the case.

1053
04:14:36,420 --> 04:14:41,110
No, I said it. Now it's gonna happen. I know, right? All right. Uh, I need

1054
04:14:41,829 --> 04:14:56,709
to put this away. I need a scaffolding. Let me buy a few of these. No, let's just get it.

1055
04:14:56,709 --> 04:15:04,620
Let's just get this actually ready to be done in one go. Don't paint the top half. Wait,

1056
04:15:05,340 --> 04:15:08,860
why do you think I'm gonna paint the top half? Just because somebody in chat said that?

1057
04:15:10,870 --> 04:15:24,739
What? I'm not gonna paint the top half. I do that a lot. Not today. Today's different.

1058
04:15:34,069 --> 04:16:12,010
I need more of these panels. No. Please fall. If there's no fall damage though,

1059
04:16:12,010 --> 04:16:16,860
so it wouldn't matter. I could fall right now and we could just like laugh hysterically

1060
04:16:16,860 --> 04:16:23,180
about me falling. Wouldn't really do anything. I'm sorry. I know that could be disappointing.

1061
04:16:24,459 --> 04:16:32,950
There's no funny health meter where I could die and, you know what I mean? I know everybody's

1062
04:16:32,950 --> 04:16:50,299
expecting it to happen, but it's not gonna do it. Sorry. Wait, there's more here? Why can

1063
04:16:50,299 --> 04:17:17,209
I not? I'm not close enough to get these. That's not possible, man. Come on. Well,

1064
04:17:17,209 --> 04:17:26,760
I have to move the scaffolding again. I mean, this is just like doing the

1065
04:17:27,479 --> 04:17:42,899
grass. It's tedious, but once you do it, it's over. And you end up in a magazine. Gardener Weekly.

1066
04:17:57,500 --> 04:18:30,180
Come on. That's such bullshit. Just move. Is it these things in the way? All right. Dude,

1067
04:18:30,180 --> 04:18:52,680
how the fuck? That's even further away. I'm just gonna have to jump. Did I not get it?

1068
04:19:00,299 --> 04:19:16,440
Okay. Cool. Cool. Very cool. Nice. Check around for bald spots. We have a few bald spots over here

1069
04:19:16,440 --> 04:19:23,819
that I'm gonna take care of. So I just sit back and relax while I take care of these walls.

1070
04:19:39,750 --> 04:19:59,579
And go. Come on, fill up that bucket. Come on, Anderson family. Okay, that's it. How many

1071
04:19:59,579 --> 04:20:06,790
panels did you get up? God damn it. There's an entire side of the fucking house.

1072
04:20:11,639 --> 04:20:47,620
I just got insane deja vu right now. Right here. Why? Did I miss one up here? No, I got it. I'm good.

1073
04:20:47,620 --> 04:21:02,500
Is this though? Oh, that was gonna be just barely a perfect exact number. And it wasn't. Oh,

1074
04:21:02,500 --> 04:21:14,379
this is gonna take so long. I can do that when I go upstairs. I gotta bring this over here.

1075
04:21:14,379 --> 04:21:36,219
Too much paneling. I'm gonna do the inside and the lawn on the house. Oh, I'm prepared.

1076
04:21:36,219 --> 04:21:47,770
I am very prepared for it. Wake up. Wake up. Painting it so much quicker is sandstone

1077
04:21:48,649 --> 04:21:58,780
cocky and just roll all of that shit on. Yeah, but it would look pretty ugly. It would be that

1078
04:21:58,780 --> 04:22:10,219
one weird solid color. It would just look like a cartoon house. This won't be much longer.

1079
04:22:10,219 --> 04:22:15,079
See, right now some of you guys are like, oh, we're just chilling out? No. Okay. All right.

1080
04:22:15,079 --> 04:22:40,870
Some of you guys got like dinner. Like eating right now. So we have plenty of time. I had

1081
04:22:40,870 --> 04:22:47,940
dinner already. What am I gonna do? What am I gonna do for dinner? That's a really,

1082
04:22:47,940 --> 04:23:01,299
really interesting question. It's gotta be something I can eat fast because I plan on

1083
04:23:01,299 --> 04:23:11,899
going for a lot longer than this. I need one more panel. Are you kidding me? Grilled cheese.

1084
04:23:11,899 --> 04:23:35,190
That doesn't sound bad. Bingo. Still have to do over there, but I do have the scaffolding

1085
04:23:35,190 --> 04:23:40,840
here I can bring over. All right. Looks all right. What have we got? Two? I had two. How

1086
04:23:41,799 --> 04:23:51,940
I just like rage bought all these. Grilled cheese and tomato soup. That sounds pretty easy.

1087
04:23:52,579 --> 04:24:09,879
Sounds pretty quick too. I'm not sure we have that here though.

1088
04:24:12,940 --> 04:24:21,139
Need to go to the grocery store. It's been a while. Pick up some essentials like cheese

1089
04:24:22,309 --> 04:24:38,950
and tomato soup. All essential things to have in your household. Got it. All right. Let's do

1090
04:24:38,950 --> 04:24:53,719
this too. Can I reach from here? No, I can't. How am I doing on money? Oh yeah, that's right. I

1091
04:24:53,719 --> 04:25:03,909
bought and sold this stupid home alone house for like $600,000. All right. What do you guys think

1092
04:25:03,909 --> 04:25:28,500
is the fastest way to make $500,000? Legally. Legally. The lottery? I said fastest. You could

1093
04:25:28,500 --> 04:25:35,639
play the lottery for like 50 years and not win. Like what is a guaranteed way to make

1094
04:25:35,639 --> 04:25:52,250
$500,000 in like a year? If anybody knew that everybody would just do it. Play Fortnite. Be a

1095
04:25:52,250 --> 04:26:04,229
Fortnite player? Is it? It's not that easy. Is it? There's a lot of people that play Fortnite

1096
04:26:04,229 --> 04:26:15,399
and some a lot of them aren't like 500,000 dares. There's a lot of people that play that

1097
04:26:15,399 --> 04:26:43,209
game. Get out of the way. I'm just gonna jump. Write an AI. Like code an AI. Work a $50,000 a

1098
04:26:43,209 --> 04:26:53,129
year job, but 10 times. Like so to have $10,000, $50,000 a year jobs at the same time. Okay.

1099
04:27:07,940 --> 04:27:22,379
Work a $500,000 a year job with an IQ thing. Win the German rumble 5,600 times. I don't do

1100
04:27:22,379 --> 04:27:37,780
that many in a year though. Coming together. Okay. So you could work for a year and get

1101
04:27:38,340 --> 04:27:46,889
$50,000. Go to the casino and put it on red 10 times. No, double it up so you get $100,000

1102
04:27:46,889 --> 04:27:52,889
and then put it on black $200,000. Put it on black $400,000. Put it on red $800,000.

1103
04:27:53,610 --> 04:28:07,190
And then you leave. You get your $400,000. Ask $500,000 people for $1 and lose everything.

1104
04:28:07,829 --> 04:28:18,020
Now do not do that. That is very bad advice. Get good at Jeopardy. Now that's a good idea.

1105
04:28:19,290 --> 04:28:27,850
That's thinking with your head. Get really good at a game show and then go win the game show.

1106
04:28:28,489 --> 04:28:48,899
Write a Star Wars movie, but you have to get hired to do the Star Wars movie. You don't

1107
04:28:48,899 --> 04:29:07,379
have to get hired to... there's $500,000 right there. Uh, no, but seriously that was 50 bucks.

1108
04:29:08,500 --> 04:29:26,059
5,000 vids from VoidSpace123. Thank you VoidSpace. And VoidSpace says,

1109
04:29:26,700 --> 04:29:30,360
Hey Jeremy, just wanted to give some appreciation for all you've done for me

1110
04:29:30,360 --> 04:29:33,959
over the years. If in times of your streams the only thing keeping me going and words cannot

1111
04:29:33,959 --> 04:29:40,219
describe how you've impacted me positively. Love you, man. Keep doing what you're doing.

1112
04:29:40,219 --> 04:29:48,020
I'm gonna keep doing it. Thank you so much for the 50 fucking dollars and

1113
04:29:48,739 --> 04:29:59,239
the incredibly kind message. Thank you, VoidSpace. I need more of these. 50 bucks is a

1114
04:29:59,239 --> 04:30:20,819
lot of money. It is to give somebody on the internet. So, and if I can impact you

1115
04:30:20,819 --> 04:30:26,809
positively, that's great. I'm very glad I do. I would hate to negatively impact somebody,

1116
04:30:27,530 --> 04:30:48,100
so I'm glad to hear that. Oh no, why is this happening? Okay, I just have to squeeze it in.

1117
04:31:00,299 --> 04:31:08,149
Almost done with the paneling. Ah, it's so close to not having to do it anymore. I'm so

1118
04:31:08,149 --> 04:31:17,379
happy. Ah, that's it, right? All right, now redo it. I don't like the color, Jeremy.

1119
04:31:17,379 --> 04:31:27,959
Let's just make sure. Is this really not a bit? No. What, you thought the whole,

1120
04:31:27,959 --> 04:31:49,559
this whole thing was a joke? Uh, no. Wait, wait, wait. Is it the family guy house?

1121
04:31:51,639 --> 04:32:03,590
It is not the family guy. Let me look this up. It's not. Family guy, that family guy house

1122
04:32:03,590 --> 04:32:30,620
is white. It is. The roof is also the same. Should I make a red door? No,

1123
04:32:30,620 --> 04:32:50,969
I don't want to have a family guy house. No. You can't even have a red door. There is no

1124
04:32:50,969 --> 04:33:19,380
red door. This is a refrigerator. Fucking family guy house. Why? You can change the door color?

1125
04:33:20,099 --> 04:33:49,139
You can? Internal door. Front door. You can't change the color. Paint the door. You can

1126
04:33:49,139 --> 04:34:28,659
paint the door? No, you can't. You can't paint the door. Got him. Yeah, I mean,

1127
04:34:29,939 --> 04:34:39,110
you can't paint the door. All right, I can't believe it's a family guy house.

1128
04:34:39,110 --> 04:34:44,380
And even the top is like green, isn't it? I think the top is this weird

1129
04:34:45,020 --> 04:34:56,340
off green kind of gray. I can't, I, I can't even look at the house now.

1130
04:34:57,369 --> 04:35:14,470
I seriously can't look at it. It's all right. No, no mini golf. I'm sticking through this. I

1131
04:35:14,470 --> 04:35:32,340
don't care if I have the family guy. Fuck. I hate this. No. Second floor. I know I'm going

1132
04:35:32,340 --> 04:35:49,930
out there. I'm going out there to finish my family guy house. Fuck. Whatever. Oh, sorry.

1133
04:35:49,930 --> 04:35:57,369
It's my other balcony. It's my other balcony I have on the other side.

1134
04:35:59,450 --> 04:36:17,270
We have three balconies. Hey Peter, do you remember the time that we built that house?

1135
04:36:18,069 --> 04:36:56,869
Yeah, it's my house, Joe. And this is the whole episode. Hey Quagmire, can you pull the

1136
04:36:56,950 --> 04:37:06,790
car in the garage? Okay. Sure thing. I do that all the time. Oh, you're all about sex, aren't you

1137
04:37:06,790 --> 04:37:50,569
Quagmire? This is like kind of cringe. No, it wasn't shut up. What are you talking about?

1138
04:37:51,130 --> 04:38:03,000
No, it wasn't shut up. What are you talking about? Don't say that. What are you talking

1139
04:38:03,000 --> 04:38:14,819
about? My Peter Griffin was like pretty good. I thought my friends told me. All right. Is

1140
04:38:14,819 --> 04:38:43,220
everything done? I think that's it. I can't paint the window frames. It doesn't work.

1141
04:38:43,220 --> 04:38:49,020
The garage. Should the garage be different? I don't think I want the garage to have these

1142
04:38:49,020 --> 04:39:19,560
same panels. Maybe like a... what's wrong with the front door? Well, it's kind of fucked up.

1143
04:39:19,560 --> 04:39:56,459
And in there? That's fine. Play the family guy theme. No, I'm not going to do that.

1144
04:39:58,619 --> 04:40:02,139
If anything, do you want me to do like this loud voice crack Peter Griffin

1145
04:40:02,139 --> 04:40:07,459
laugh? I mean, I'll do that again. When you start to get like a little rambunctious.

1146
04:40:08,099 --> 04:40:18,619
All right, I want something different out here. Add doors to the house. Hold on, hold on.

1147
04:40:18,619 --> 04:40:33,400
I feel bad for the people that I turn away. Stop writing the things that you're

1148
04:40:33,400 --> 04:40:37,419
saying. That's not the problem. It was nothing to do with being tired.

1149
04:40:37,419 --> 04:40:56,459
Oh, there is a doormat right here. All right. I need some sliders. I need a few of them.

1150
04:40:56,459 --> 04:41:30,169
That one. I might change this. Okay. What are you guys doing? Why are you

1151
04:41:30,169 --> 04:41:59,099
doing that cringey thing in chat right now? Is there something cringey going on in here?

1152
04:41:59,099 --> 04:42:05,270
All right. In turn, let's do... I don't want to put the doors. I'll put some placeholder

1153
04:42:05,270 --> 04:42:10,840
doors. I'll put some $246 placeholders because I don't know what the color in the paint and

1154
04:42:10,840 --> 04:42:19,400
stuff is going to be in here. Anybody have a clip of me doing that? I want to see what it

1155
04:42:19,400 --> 04:42:24,939
sounded like. I'm going to mute the audio though. That's just for me. I want to hear it.

1156
04:42:32,569 --> 04:42:47,909
Make that the front door. No, that's fine. Place the fridge on the front lawn and it'll

1157
04:42:47,909 --> 04:43:05,540
be a true Vegas house. Fridge on the front lawn. What does that mean? Nobody has a clip

1158
04:43:05,540 --> 04:43:17,110
of that. No one saved that. How many people are here? There are 3,652. There are 3,600

1159
04:43:17,110 --> 04:43:21,590
fucking people here. No one fucking clipped it. They must have hated it. You guys must

1160
04:43:21,590 --> 04:43:29,900
have hated that. Is this it? Okay. Here's a clip of it. This clip has one view and it's

1161
04:43:29,900 --> 04:43:37,990
me. Somebody had to go back and clip this because it was so... They hated it so much.

1162
04:43:41,619 --> 04:44:04,630
Hold on. I'm muting. I want to hear this. It's not that bad. Why did everybody hate

1163
04:44:04,630 --> 04:44:15,369
that so much? What was wrong with that? I thought that was pretty good.

1164
04:44:34,819 --> 04:44:56,540
I won't put you through that. Don't ever do that again.

1165
04:44:57,340 --> 04:45:07,959
All right. Let's go like this. Move office here? No. The internet here sucks. I have

1166
04:45:07,959 --> 04:45:12,279
to move to my office. This is pissing me off though. Seriously. How do I fix this?

1167
04:45:13,080 --> 04:45:24,009
You know what I'm saying? Like, why is it like this? What's... Why do I have Tetris

1168
04:45:24,009 --> 04:45:36,060
pieces in my front lawn? This is... Recreate the Family Guy interior. That would be

1169
04:45:36,060 --> 04:45:42,279
committing so hard to something. That was never supposed to be that. First it was

1170
04:45:42,279 --> 04:45:57,959
mini golf. Now it's a one-to-one internal Family Guy house. No. That's gonna be worse

1171
04:45:57,959 --> 04:46:05,029
noise of 2019. I already know it. I don't even need to do any more noises ever again.

1172
04:46:09,259 --> 04:46:28,490
All right. I want... Let's get the grass rolled out here. Family Golf. What do I need? The

1173
04:46:28,490 --> 04:46:45,959
turf. All right. There's some turf here. It looks like shit. I gotta go this way.

1174
04:46:46,759 --> 04:46:53,220
I'm trying to write an essay. Can you stop streaming? Yeah. Thanks for coming out

1175
04:46:53,220 --> 04:46:57,139
everybody. Does somebody making an essay don't want to like fuck up this cool thing? So

1176
04:47:02,840 --> 04:47:05,240
I should be careful doing that because I wonder how many people what like the

1177
04:47:05,240 --> 04:47:10,919
percentage of people that just click off the stream when that slide comes up. It's probably

1178
04:47:10,919 --> 04:47:43,639
pretty high. I'm just gonna buy it. Look, you know what? Okay. I actually kind of like this.

1179
04:47:45,619 --> 04:47:57,880
Maybe I'll keep a couple stacks. All right. Let's go back here. Get it lined up. It's a farm.

1180
04:47:58,759 --> 04:48:03,159
Why did I do that? I did it because I was sick of going into the menu and buying them.

1181
04:48:03,799 --> 04:48:18,630
So I'm gonna just use these and not have to buy them. See? They just... Right here. Done. Go.

1182
04:48:18,630 --> 04:48:35,500
Roll. It doesn't matter. It could be uneven. I have a ton of them. Wait. This is the driveway.

1183
04:48:36,139 --> 04:48:39,180
Hold on. Yeah. Fuck it. Go for it. That's driveway.

1184
04:48:49,029 --> 04:48:53,110
He's still on the lawn. No. Did you? Wait. Wait. Somebody just came in. There's a big reveal.

1185
04:48:53,110 --> 04:48:56,939
Ready? You saw what looked up before. Yeah. He's still on the lawn. Just what? Not the

1186
04:48:56,939 --> 04:49:17,590
lawn anymore. Ready? One. Two. Take a look now. See? All right. So then from here

1187
04:49:17,590 --> 04:49:27,959
to here needs to be a driveway. This is... No. Why would you do it like this? This is too...

1188
04:49:28,680 --> 04:49:33,240
This is a huge driveway. This is like... The whole side yard is gonna be a driveway.

1189
04:49:33,880 --> 04:49:49,540
The driveway comes to the... It hits the side of the house. This is too much driveway. This

1190
04:49:49,540 --> 04:49:56,389
is more driveway than any yard. What I'm gonna have to do is I'm gonna have to have the

1191
04:49:56,389 --> 04:50:13,659
driveway come down here and then go to a single lane. But that's gonna look ugly. Hold

1192
04:50:13,659 --> 04:50:31,240
on. Yeah. And I'm not gonna... Just hold on. Let's do the dog park. Get rid of some of these.

1193
04:50:31,880 --> 04:50:44,259
Just curb it. Yeah. Doesn't have to be a garage. It could be a tool shed. But what

1194
04:50:44,259 --> 04:50:59,400
do you do with your car? Park on the street? Yes. But if I... No. I can make a... I can

1195
04:50:59,400 --> 04:51:05,259
make... I can do it. If I have a two-car garage, why would I park my car on the street?

1196
04:51:06,060 --> 04:51:17,770
Don't hit the tree. Don't hit the tree. Don't hit the tree. Don't hit the tree. Don't hit

1197
04:51:17,770 --> 04:51:26,790
the tree. Don't hit the tree. Yes. Didn't hit the tree. Don't buy them. You don't need it.

1198
04:51:29,110 --> 04:51:37,110
Just park in your neighbor's garage. I don't think they would be too happy about that.

1199
04:51:49,860 --> 04:52:05,770
A, they will. A, they will. Oh, I'm just making these patches. I got an idea for back here. A

1200
04:52:05,770 --> 04:52:13,939
little barbecue section. Out and around. More garden this way. Of like millions of dollars

1201
04:52:13,939 --> 04:52:18,889
worth of shit back here too. Because it's protected by the fence. And then a little

1202
04:52:18,889 --> 04:52:35,110
plague area back here. It's gonna be insane. Let's just get this over with. Let me see

1203
04:52:35,110 --> 04:52:55,930
what this would look like. I need like gravel. Is there like driveway? Gravel.

1204
04:52:57,880 --> 04:53:10,470
No, you don't like drive on crushed stone. Stone? Like this? Like pavement? Is it just

1205
04:53:10,470 --> 04:53:22,979
a pavement? As concrete? Yeah, but like pavement. They don't have like pavement.

1206
04:53:23,779 --> 04:53:41,669
It's like one of these. I don't like the designs on here though.

1207
04:53:41,750 --> 04:54:06,500
I just want it to be plain. That's not bad. The pebbles. It looks good. I don't hate this.

1208
04:54:15,509 --> 04:54:25,029
Why not search for concrete? I already did. It's like these weird... I don't like this.

1209
04:54:27,880 --> 04:54:45,299
I don't like the... I want like it to be just plain. There's no asphalt either.

1210
04:54:50,889 --> 04:54:59,099
No, this is not bad. But it's too small. That's not bad. Composite board though. No,

1211
04:54:59,340 --> 04:55:18,090
just break cobblestone circles. I'll just go with... I'll go with what I was doing before,

1212
04:55:18,090 --> 04:55:37,419
the pebble one. I like it. How big is it? 50 by... How big is that? That's so tiny.

1213
04:55:37,419 --> 04:55:45,860
Gold driveway. What about cat's head? Gold? This might be like kind of cool looking.

1214
04:55:45,860 --> 04:56:26,619
Is it spot surface? Spot surface? A sports surface. There it is. Yep, there it is.

1215
04:56:27,259 --> 04:56:36,439
This is fucking ugly though. I actually like that better. I like the weird like rich,

1216
04:56:37,159 --> 04:57:20,439
crystal one. It's called cat's. It's the biggest it can get. The first one was correct. Okay,

1217
04:57:20,439 --> 04:57:38,919
by many. Here we go. This is gonna take a hundred years. I have to match up the pieces.

1218
04:58:05,450 --> 04:58:24,549
Sand? A sand driveway. It's like the house fell over and planted its forehead into the

1219
04:58:24,549 --> 04:58:40,490
ground. Bark? Single color gravel. I want darker than this though. I want red. Wood cuttings.

1220
04:58:42,819 --> 04:58:56,889
Like black. Wood chippings? This is as dark as I can get it. There we go. This is perfect.

1221
04:58:58,889 --> 04:59:39,750
Perfect. Hello? Size is small enough. We want sand. We want sand. No. No, you can't always get

1222
04:59:39,750 --> 05:00:15,639
what you want. But what about what I want? What do I want? This is what I want. Fucking huge.

1223
05:00:15,639 --> 05:00:41,540
Tear down the garage. I don't think I can. It's like it's a structure that can't be moved,

1224
05:00:41,540 --> 05:00:54,330
I don't think. Move it closer to the road. Tear it down and make it closer.

1225
05:01:01,909 --> 05:01:10,490
This is as big as I can get it. All right, so I'm gonna change this in a minute here. This

1226
05:01:10,490 --> 05:01:17,099
is straight over here. So the car, you have to have enough for the car to turn in here.

1227
05:01:17,180 --> 05:01:52,470
Car comes in. Straight through. Yeah, that's fine. And then, yeah, it turns into the two car garage

1228
05:01:52,470 --> 05:02:03,689
right here. Because this is too close. This is right here. It's too close to the edge of the

1229
05:02:03,689 --> 05:02:43,529
house. Let me see what happens if I do this. Come on, get it. We're keeping our sand. Where

1230
05:02:43,529 --> 05:02:58,779
are you gonna get the sand? Where you get this magic sand? So then here, I'm gonna go like

1231
05:02:58,779 --> 05:03:36,279
this. This can be changed. It's hard to, look, there's not specific tools I can paint well with.

1232
05:03:36,279 --> 05:03:42,700
I can't like brush it like this. I have to put it all the way over here, see? They're not the

1233
05:03:42,700 --> 05:04:10,090
best tools. It's not gonna be exact. Plus we're gonna put stuff on the sides anyways. No,

1234
05:04:10,090 --> 05:04:14,889
look, look. All right, I'm gonna show this to you one more time. I can't start deleting.

1235
05:04:14,889 --> 05:04:21,529
Look, look it! I can only start deleting when it's there. And if I click right now,

1236
05:04:21,529 --> 05:04:26,060
you know what's gonna happen. Even when it's tiny. Look, like.

1237
05:04:30,220 --> 05:05:46,630
I'm just covering this up with fucking bushes. There we go. Flatliner raid coming in.

1238
05:05:46,630 --> 05:05:54,490
To fix this over here though. All right, let's put some grass down.

1239
05:05:54,490 --> 05:06:04,840
Because then there'll be like a bush here. Like a little fence or something.

1240
05:06:04,840 --> 05:06:21,779
All right, time for grass. Are you looking? Here it comes. This actually is gonna suck.

1241
05:06:21,779 --> 05:06:37,580
I should have done this first. This is gonna be horrible. I can't tell. Is that right?

1242
05:06:38,380 --> 05:06:49,270
Is it running the edge? Yeah, god damn it. Why can't I just paint the grass? Why,

1243
05:06:49,270 --> 05:06:55,990
why can't I just like have a grass tool? Why do I have to roll it out in a straight line?

1244
05:06:55,990 --> 05:07:29,939
That's not even. Get it. Get it. I did it. Thank god. Oh my goodness. Stop,

1245
05:07:29,939 --> 05:07:32,900
stop. I did it. I got it good. It's good. What are you talking about? Stop.

1246
05:07:32,900 --> 05:07:54,380
I got it. Crisis has been averted. Don't worry guys. Everything's just fine. I can't wait to do

1247
05:07:54,380 --> 05:07:59,029
everything and then look back at just how amazing it was. I can't wait to look back

1248
05:07:59,830 --> 05:08:06,520
at some of the real highlights of this stream. You know, disposing of all the stuff. Putting

1249
05:08:06,520 --> 05:08:12,650
up the plants. Asking for you guys what you think. Doing probably the best peter driven I

1250
05:08:12,650 --> 05:08:16,090
think I've ever done in my life. There's been some pretty good highlights from me here.

1251
05:08:19,139 --> 05:08:38,180
He's gonna get one more. One more. One more. One more. It's too addicting.

1252
05:08:39,060 --> 05:08:53,080
Just gonna keep rolling. Oh, Jesus. Dr. Low Note just came in with 10 community subs. Thank

1253
05:08:53,080 --> 05:09:02,459
you, Dr. Low Note. That's a lot of subs. Thank you for the huge amount of community subs. Dr.

1254
05:09:02,459 --> 05:09:13,270
Low Note. I, don't worry guys. I will, I will satiate your sand appetite because there's

1255
05:09:13,349 --> 05:09:20,790
gonna be a big sand play pen over here on the, to the left. You guys are making flat lines?

1256
05:09:22,069 --> 05:09:40,470
That's so stupid. Let's go straight up. A big litter box. Oh, it's gonna be like a little

1257
05:09:40,470 --> 05:10:00,220
sand castle thing. Is there any dirt back here? Did I just line that up perfectly first try?

1258
05:10:00,220 --> 05:10:08,919
Tell me I did. Oh, that was so close. I love how I just said first try. It's actually

1259
05:10:08,919 --> 05:10:29,189
like 400th try as far as I can get it to here. Let's try. I'm gonna try to get this

1260
05:10:29,189 --> 05:10:48,740
little edge. It's gonna be rough. See if I can do it. Dude, what's with the Z fighting going on

1261
05:10:48,740 --> 05:10:55,819
in the back? I know. That's what I was saying earlier. So that's Z fighting right there,

1262
05:10:55,819 --> 05:11:04,119
right? That's what you guys are talking about. He's wasting money. I have $374,000.

1263
05:11:05,400 --> 05:11:11,959
I got plenty. I'm gonna sell this house for like a million dollars. So don't worry. I'll be

1264
05:11:11,959 --> 05:11:21,220
fine. This is gonna be really, really horrible though. Oh, this sucks. How am I gonna take

1265
05:11:21,220 --> 05:11:40,939
care of this? What's the reliable way to do this? It's alright. You have 500k before the

1266
05:11:41,500 --> 05:12:03,419
Jenga debacle. Yeah, I'll get it all back. This house is gonna be worth a lot of money.

1267
05:12:03,419 --> 05:12:08,939
Get in there and clean that up. Let's go with a small one. Not just a regular one, right? So

1268
05:12:08,939 --> 05:12:17,430
I can just get it right on the edge here. How am I gonna do this? I'm gonna have to

1269
05:12:17,430 --> 05:12:31,580
start like here. I'm just gonna have to add gravel. That's two. No, I'm just gonna add gravel.

1270
05:12:31,580 --> 05:12:36,939
I got enough grass here. What I can just do from here and it'll be fine. And then I'll just

1271
05:12:36,939 --> 05:12:49,939
cover it with gravel. When am I gonna do the swamp? Swamp is gonna be on the other side.

1272
05:12:49,939 --> 05:13:11,880
Wait, what's swamp? What are you talking about? The swamp. What are we doing? I guess

1273
05:13:11,880 --> 05:13:22,490
we're doing a swamp. By swamp, they meant circus. I still have to go. Remember we tried

1274
05:13:22,490 --> 05:13:27,959
that yesterday? Putting the little wood chips and stuff and it doesn't work because this is

1275
05:13:27,959 --> 05:13:32,700
its own hitbox. It's on collision. I have to put a bush in front of it or something.

1276
05:13:33,500 --> 05:13:42,040
Alright, last one. This should do it. Let's get a regular one. And I can just, I actually

1277
05:13:42,040 --> 05:13:47,020
can use this to make its own line. I'm kind of in crooch here and it's no, I can't.

1278
05:13:48,259 --> 05:14:02,069
I can't. I'll just do it with the gravel. That'll be fine. I'll clean it up. Don't worry.

1279
05:14:09,139 --> 05:14:14,500
Oof, perfect. Exactly what I was looking for. So I'll get the square and I will just square it

1280
05:14:14,500 --> 05:14:23,419
up and then move down and square it up and then move down. Looks pretty good. Which,

1281
05:14:23,419 --> 05:14:36,659
what color was this? This is the dark one, right? Crushed stone. Is it gravel?

1282
05:14:39,909 --> 05:14:44,549
Two. This one, tiny little pebble. That doesn't look, that's a false advertising.

1283
05:14:45,110 --> 05:14:58,470
I need to square as well. Hey chat, is this your precious sand?

1284
05:14:59,430 --> 05:15:04,139
What a shame it is if somebody would have covered this all up.

1285
05:15:31,180 --> 05:15:38,729
Not very much left, unfortunately.

1286
05:16:01,770 --> 05:16:29,220
This music is really not making this as sad as I want it to be.

1287
05:16:47,540 --> 05:16:51,459
He's just playing with us now. He's toying with us now. He's toying with us.

1288
05:16:51,459 --> 05:17:19,290
This is already a sharp edge. What are you doing? Okay.

1289
05:17:19,290 --> 05:17:41,130
There's going to be a bush anyways, so it's okay. Is this the sand here? I can't have that.

1290
05:17:41,849 --> 05:17:49,740
All right, there's going to be some bushes. Finally, we're, no we're not. God, we're not

1291
05:17:49,740 --> 05:18:03,540
done at all. I need more turf. A small one to get over here. Did I get it right?

1292
05:18:11,430 --> 05:18:33,099
No. It's okay. I can clean it up. It's fine. Give me the, give me a bigger one.

1293
05:18:33,740 --> 05:18:42,520
It's the regular one and we'll be good here. Right there. Plus I will have something on the,

1294
05:18:43,240 --> 05:18:47,220
maybe a couple, maybe those kind of tall hedges. What do you guys think?

1295
05:18:47,939 --> 05:19:24,540
You guys picked this time, not me. Sand around the edges? That could work. It's not ruined yet.

1296
05:19:24,540 --> 05:19:42,779
Not yet, not yet. Because I'm gonna, just like I did over here, we're gonna fix this.

1297
05:19:42,779 --> 05:19:55,049
It's not ruined. I want to know, like, when you do the smile like this,

1298
05:19:55,049 --> 05:20:12,900
are you doing that in real life too? I bet you aren't. I bet you're not. I bet you're just

1299
05:20:12,900 --> 05:20:46,279
sitting there tightening it. You don't actually mean it. I'm just going to put some, there'll

1300
05:20:46,279 --> 05:20:50,619
be bushes here. I'm not going to spend like an eternity trying to get this perfect. We're

1301
05:20:50,619 --> 05:21:01,290
going to have bushes, hedges. There's no reason to do this. Not at all. All right.

1302
05:21:02,470 --> 05:21:09,369
Hey, you guys still awake? You guys still with me here? We have what is the beginning

1303
05:21:09,369 --> 05:21:37,860
of a driveway? A tree? I need, I kind of like these things. Those tall, every maybe like

1304
05:21:37,860 --> 05:21:43,939
right next to each other. I could go all out and just line it with these or with these.

1305
05:21:44,580 --> 05:21:50,869
What do you guys think? Don't worry, the carrots will go to the circus. Don't worry.

1306
05:21:50,869 --> 05:21:55,189
I know everyone's going to freak out when they see that. I'm thinking a line of these

1307
05:21:58,119 --> 05:22:13,299
right next to each other or these ones. These ones here make them flaming hot

1308
05:22:13,299 --> 05:22:20,939
Cheeto flavored. What do you think? Or I don't think it should be green.

1309
05:22:26,650 --> 05:22:40,569
Regular Cheetos or flaming hot Cheetos? You need to combine these to heal. God. Flaming hot

1310
05:22:40,569 --> 05:22:55,880
Cheetos? Let's see. Let's take a look and I'm talking back to back here all the way down.

1311
05:22:55,880 --> 05:23:02,169
Now that'd be like kind of like monarch, right? That'd be royalty. Too royalty. Too much royalty.

1312
05:23:04,069 --> 05:23:23,590
Uh no, I don't like it. I don't like that either. It's gonna be bigger. Maybe these?

1313
05:23:26,950 --> 05:23:34,619
Oh Jesus, these are fucking huge. Okay, does anybody feel like these are too big?

1314
05:23:34,619 --> 05:23:53,580
Is it that I got like a weird scale here? They're that big? These? I don't know. I don't

1315
05:23:53,580 --> 05:24:01,860
mind this. Although it's kind of big and annoying. This might be too annoying. Maybe.

1316
05:24:02,819 --> 05:24:11,930
I'm afraid there are no cactuses unfortunately in one of these. Let's see. That's a little less

1317
05:24:11,930 --> 05:24:19,349
insane. Let's, I got money so let's just play with it. Ready? I need to be close enough to

1318
05:24:19,349 --> 05:24:49,220
be on them. What's that one? It's not a Christmas tree runway. It's, there's gonna

1319
05:24:49,220 --> 05:25:35,669
be other stuff in between. Two more. Where's the reindeer? Stop. Shut up. Stop it. Hey,

1320
05:25:35,669 --> 05:25:55,659
leave me alone. Oh man. Oh man. Let's look. See it's, it doesn't look, it looks fine.

1321
05:25:55,659 --> 05:26:06,919
That looks okay. That looks fine. There's nothing wrong with that. I'm gonna put some

1322
05:26:06,919 --> 05:26:27,819
flowers in the middle. I'll put a row of like red flowers down here. Or orange. I'm doing it.

1323
05:26:27,819 --> 05:26:50,340
You know, I don't care what the haters say. Oh, the haters are right this time.

1324
05:26:59,799 --> 05:27:04,939
The five people who are on the left have all fallen asleep. They haven't commented

1325
05:27:04,939 --> 05:27:20,419
over an hour. Is that true? Just stick with me guys. Stick with me. I've got a, I got a plan.

1326
05:27:21,880 --> 05:27:26,040
Just the back, this is just the, we're gonna finish up the back here. I don't need anything

1327
05:27:26,040 --> 05:27:37,459
on this side. In fact, I am gonna put this one here. No I'm not. Put it back. I haven't even

1328
05:27:37,459 --> 05:27:54,279
planted this. Where was it? It was like right there. That's okay. That's good. I haven't even

1329
05:27:54,279 --> 05:28:33,270
planted this. That looks good. What, what's wrong with having all these trees? You're losing

1330
05:28:33,270 --> 05:28:47,990
the casual audience. Should I spray myself with a hose? I actually kind of like this.

1331
05:28:48,709 --> 05:28:53,270
You can call me a boomer if you want. It looks fine. It looks good. I think it looks all right.

1332
05:28:57,959 --> 05:29:02,919
I really do. And we're gonna do a huge, a couple of huge ones over here.

1333
05:29:03,479 --> 05:29:06,360
No we're not. No, we don't need anything over there. No, no. Watch this.

1334
05:29:07,000 --> 05:29:40,819
Ladies and gentlemen, these look like they're too tall. They're too tall.

1335
05:29:41,380 --> 05:29:50,779
They gotta be shorter. Just by like, not by very much. Here we go. There we go. There it is.

1336
05:29:51,500 --> 05:31:04,139
Okay, if they were symmetrical. It's not a clown garden. It's not a clown.

1337
05:31:08,709 --> 05:31:36,889
This is not a clown garden. This is a normal garden with fun things. Still a clown.

1338
05:31:36,889 --> 05:31:44,330
And then back here is gonna be a couple of other things. It's not a clown garden. Hey,

1339
05:31:44,330 --> 05:31:57,189
that's a pretty nice clown garden. Back to orange. I just got here. Why is he making a

1340
05:31:57,189 --> 05:32:44,580
clown garden? I think it looks pretty. And then we're gonna do yellow. It's five, five,

1341
05:32:44,580 --> 05:33:11,750
and then bingo. This one had to be six because it was a little longer. That looks kind of nice.

1342
05:33:11,750 --> 05:33:50,819
And then I'm gonna get, watch this, a cinnamon apple tree. Apple trees down here. Get them

1343
05:33:50,819 --> 05:34:15,529
in the middle. Those are clown noses. Oh, fuck. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm flatlining. Please

1344
05:34:15,529 --> 05:34:22,700
switch to the pre-recorded track. I told you it was gonna be all night. I gave you fair warning.

1345
05:34:22,700 --> 05:34:28,459
I warned you like four hours ago that we were gonna go all night and I was gonna make an entire

1346
05:34:28,459 --> 05:34:41,099
fucking done house. It's gonna be unbelievable. Your jaw's gonna hit the ground. Dude, I got

1347
05:34:41,099 --> 05:34:45,900
beers to go. There you go. What time is it? It's like nine o'clock Pacific. Oh, it is

1348
05:34:45,900 --> 05:34:50,860
midnight. Whatever. All night. What is it? Friday? What are you doing tomorrow? It's

1349
05:34:50,860 --> 05:35:13,639
Friday night. What do you got going on tomorrow? It's a weekend. I think that looks cool. Yes,

1350
05:35:13,639 --> 05:35:20,939
sure. You could tell me that this looks like Baby's First Unity game. I, okay, I would,

1351
05:35:20,939 --> 05:35:31,979
I might laugh at that. I would chuckle at that for a second. Did you see what it looked

1352
05:35:31,979 --> 05:35:45,720
like before? Okay, and now, what am I gonna put the red frid, wait, what's the deal with

1353
05:35:45,720 --> 05:35:54,259
the red fridge? I need something on the other side. What should go on the other side here

1354
05:35:54,259 --> 05:36:07,180
on the right? Maybe like a hand rail, a railing. Is it gonna hand rail? Something, this is missing

1355
05:36:07,180 --> 05:36:18,099
something. A flower bed. Yeah, that's probably a good idea. A red fridge. I'm not putting a

1356
05:36:18,099 --> 05:37:02,150
red fridge. Why would anybody have this many plants? All right, let's be honest. Why would

1357
05:37:02,150 --> 05:37:08,700
somebody have this much, this many plants? Dude, this is a full-time job for like 10 people

1358
05:37:08,700 --> 05:37:16,099
to maintain all this. To take care of all this stuff, you would need fucking like 12 employees.

1359
05:37:16,659 --> 05:37:30,360
All right, so let's put some flowers in here. Flowers. Nice ones. Strawberry flower. Large roses.

1360
05:37:31,159 --> 05:39:10,569
Here we go. Here we go. Here we go. There we go. This is so much time and energy.

1361
05:39:11,369 --> 05:39:18,599
How would you even know one of these died? Would you even know? I feel like you wouldn't

1362
05:39:18,599 --> 05:39:29,979
know when one of these died. I already blew it though. Does it move the whole thing?

1363
05:39:30,700 --> 05:40:02,389
Thank god it does. I need more gravel here. Look at that. Better. Looks better. I need one more here

1364
05:40:02,389 --> 05:40:24,650
I think. Move this one back. Move this one forward. Gravel. This trash in the garage,

1365
05:40:24,650 --> 05:40:54,900
doesn't it? Some gravel. Go right to the edge on this one. I wonder if I should just

1366
05:40:54,900 --> 05:41:03,319
put that around here? Yeah. Hello, can I get an estimate of getting my lawn done? I'm sorry,

1367
05:41:03,319 --> 05:41:17,900
I add in the paper. Uh, $500,000 in one payment. Something's missing here though.

1368
05:41:18,380 --> 05:41:34,279
I got my trees. I got the, maybe something else right there. A big boulder or a fountain.

1369
05:41:34,279 --> 05:41:42,729
A fountain. I like a fountain better than a boulder. Which one? This one looks kind of good.

1370
05:41:43,369 --> 05:41:59,450
Try the blue. What if we did two fountains? Fountain, fountain, and fountain in the middle.

1371
05:42:00,090 --> 05:42:38,229
Wait a minute. Hold on. No. No. No, don't work. This might go over here. I'm gonna

1372
05:42:38,229 --> 05:43:01,220
sneeze. I'm just boring you. Maybe just one of the big ones. Like one of these. Stone.

1373
05:43:01,220 --> 05:43:21,590
Green. That. Let's see this. That's not terrible. Turn it though. I think it's the same color as

1374
05:43:21,590 --> 05:43:32,330
the grass. I don't think I can even do that. You guys want me to change off of Sandy? Is that

1375
05:43:32,330 --> 05:43:43,590
what you guys are saying? All right. Something right here. I think in, I'm thinking something

1376
05:43:43,590 --> 05:43:53,130
cool. A little decoration. Maybe you have a big, big tulip, blamp, birdbath, rabbit cage.

1377
05:43:53,770 --> 05:44:33,880
A big rock. Another pool? Yeah. Move it over a little bit. You're gonna have so many

1378
05:44:33,880 --> 05:45:33,529
mosquitoes. So extra. I figured out what I'm doing. I am desperately trying to have the

1379
05:45:33,529 --> 05:45:41,130
coolest house on the block for their Christmas decorations. I'm trying to make one of those

1380
05:45:41,130 --> 05:45:46,759
houses that you drive by during Christmas. And you go, holy fuck, that person's insane.

1381
05:45:57,159 --> 05:46:03,779
I have to have the most ridiculous house on the whole lot. Except all year round. Yeah,

1382
05:46:03,779 --> 05:46:08,970
that's it. This is too, okay, I'm getting way too super extra extra. Let's do something

1383
05:46:08,970 --> 05:46:14,650
over here too. This house is gonna be worth a fucking trillion dollars. Bird feeder. Perfect.

1384
05:46:15,740 --> 05:46:27,419
Make it not ash. Right near the tree. Right here. Right here. No, no, no, no, that goes

1385
05:46:27,419 --> 05:46:37,979
over here. That goes in the backyard. So you can look out the window from your fucking weird

1386
05:46:37,979 --> 05:47:17,080
dungeon room and see the birds eating. All right. And then a gazebo. Never mind. Won't

1387
05:47:17,080 --> 05:47:59,900
fit. Can I have a bridge go over the driveway? How do I? Oh, there's too much here. Garden. Um,

1388
05:48:00,700 --> 05:48:08,090
fences. No, uh, architecture. No recreation. Um, yeah, something fun. No, that goes in the

1389
05:48:08,090 --> 05:48:36,939
back. A hammock. Right here. Right in between the apples. You come out here and enjoy the

1390
05:48:36,939 --> 05:48:47,099
pond. Grab an apple. You can just like bite into it. I'm going to turn this actually.

1391
05:48:47,099 --> 05:49:09,419
Just a little bit. Pull it forward. This is fucking insane. Nice. Ruined. Change it back.

1392
05:49:09,419 --> 05:49:20,680
All right. This is coming together. This looks really interesting. By the way, interesting is

1393
05:49:20,680 --> 05:49:26,619
a fake compliment when something looks terrible, but you don't say it looks bad. It looks

1394
05:49:26,619 --> 05:49:38,259
interesting. Which means bad. All right. I think we're done with the driveway portion. Well,

1395
05:49:38,259 --> 05:49:42,299
it gets over here later when we leave the backyard. I want something secret back here

1396
05:49:42,299 --> 05:49:50,549
that the only I know about nobody else does. Yeah. I want a secret grill back here. No,

1397
05:49:50,549 --> 05:49:56,020
I want a tire swing back here. I want a fire pit back here. No, that goes in the backyard. I want

1398
05:49:56,020 --> 05:50:31,540
a secret grill. That makes no sense. Remember I told you I needed something here. This is

1399
05:50:31,540 --> 05:51:01,430
what we needed. This is what we needed. I need to move this. How do I move this?

1400
05:51:10,599 --> 05:51:19,500
Too much. Is it too much? I feel like, um, I feel like this is okay though. Does this need

1401
05:51:19,500 --> 05:51:36,009
to go? No, I think that's fine. You're gonna go up a ski lift. But a fire pit needs to go here.

1402
05:51:36,009 --> 05:51:42,139
No, that needs to go in the backyard. Can I put this here? There has to be like a table. Give

1403
05:51:42,139 --> 05:51:58,229
me a table. Table. Something fun. Something cool. Something swanky. Something chic. Here

1404
05:51:58,229 --> 05:52:13,450
we go. This is turning into a grandma house. It's turning into an old lady house. Real quick.

1405
05:52:18,779 --> 05:52:26,069
This is really quickly. I need something over here though. It looks all right.

1406
05:52:26,869 --> 05:52:36,919
I like that color. Um, I want a little, I want something over here. Edible plants. Um, pumpkin?

1407
05:52:36,919 --> 05:52:47,560
No, that makes no sense. What can go right? Nothing. Nothing needs to be right here until we

1408
05:52:47,560 --> 05:53:00,790
get over here. And then we got, bang, here's your walkway. Walkway. Let me get this going

1409
05:53:00,790 --> 05:53:17,049
here. I need like a good pool and a pool fit back here. Why is the front yard way bigger

1410
05:53:17,130 --> 05:53:37,639
than the backyard? All right, here we go. I want a sick patio barbecue. Bring your friends over.

1411
05:53:37,639 --> 05:53:44,340
Chill. Have a couple of drinks. Talk shit about the game. Last game that came out.

1412
05:53:44,340 --> 05:53:52,229
All right, here we go. I'm going to go with out these doors. This is like the, this is

1413
05:53:52,229 --> 05:53:55,430
like a cigarette den, right? You go out here and you have like a cigarette. This is where

1414
05:53:55,430 --> 05:53:58,630
the people that go have cigarettes. This is not like in the, who cares? This is stupid.

1415
05:53:59,189 --> 05:54:08,040
Out here, though, is the whole thing. So I'm going to go with one of those.

1416
05:54:09,459 --> 05:54:32,950
Um, what are they called? What's the thing that, um, not a gazebo. What's it called?

1417
05:54:45,060 --> 05:54:50,099
Yeah, there. Okay. Yeah, there it is. Perp, gondola. Isn't it? What is a gondola?

1418
05:54:58,470 --> 05:55:06,740
God, the gondola is a boat. I'm going to say we want something a little lighter.

1419
05:55:07,380 --> 05:55:53,930
Maybe, maybe white. I like this bank. Shit. That actually is ruined. Yes. I know. I know.

1420
05:55:53,930 --> 05:56:34,020
I got it. I got it. I fixed it. I got it. Everything's fixed. Come on. Come on. Killing

1421
05:56:34,020 --> 05:57:10,040
me here. I know. No, God damn it. It's got to be closer to the house somehow.

1422
05:57:10,040 --> 05:57:20,659
Right there. Got it. Finally. Holy shit. That's too long. All right. Now let's go

1423
05:57:20,659 --> 05:57:26,659
ahead and let's make a little bit of a, I think I'm going to do a little bit of mulch.

1424
05:57:26,659 --> 05:57:36,180
I'm going to do some mulch that goes around here and like stops here. Let's mulch it.

1425
05:57:36,180 --> 05:57:58,650
I need some walkway. I need some paving stone here. That's an interesting design.

1426
05:57:59,990 --> 05:58:29,430
Paving stone, uh, symphonia. Which one? I like this one. Use the stepping stones.

1427
05:58:30,150 --> 05:58:47,659
I will. We're going to do these, uh, sandy. I need something. I need something out here first,

1428
05:58:47,659 --> 05:59:29,700
though. Stepping stones is later. Perfect opportunity for our cat. Is it not flush?

1429
05:59:30,659 --> 05:59:32,099
Can it even be flush with the house?

1430
05:59:58,619 --> 06:00:24,090
Saved it. It's too big. What the hell? Why? I can't do anything about that. Is this going to

1431
06:00:24,090 --> 06:01:02,500
have to be there? I can use the small pieces later. It's not matching up. I need the smaller

1432
06:01:02,500 --> 06:01:16,790
one to do the front here. What color do I want? This one, this, and then this, right? Right here?

1433
06:01:18,299 --> 06:01:39,419
Beige and dark gray. I thought that should do it. In fact, I'm going to make sure it does it.

1434
06:01:39,419 --> 06:02:07,340
I'm going to come out again. No, get rid of this door. Oh, hello? Why? Hello? What was

1435
06:02:07,340 --> 06:02:27,500
that happening for? Starting. I got it. Okay. Now I should be able to do the bigger piece.

1436
06:02:34,340 --> 06:02:45,369
Beige and dark gray. Now will this line up correctly in here? I'm going to have to just

1437
06:02:45,369 --> 06:02:55,560
sacrifice. Yeah, it does. We're good. That's all right. I can, I can work with this later.

1438
06:02:55,560 --> 06:03:18,139
Right on the edge here. Come on. Come on. Why? Give me a break. I'm going to have to do

1439
06:03:18,139 --> 06:03:36,020
little pieces. This thing's in the way. It took so long to get this flush too. All right,

1440
06:03:36,020 --> 06:03:41,060
it should work now. It should be good to go. There we go. Okay. Are we lined up? Do we

1441
06:03:41,060 --> 06:03:50,099
have good, uh, what's the best way? What do you think? Right there. Thank God. Finally.

1442
06:03:58,540 --> 06:04:02,740
I can use the little piece and I can go in the middle here. I think. I hope so.

1443
06:04:40,380 --> 06:04:51,540
No, it's not going to work. I could just fill this with rocks.

1444
06:04:53,580 --> 06:04:56,939
I'm just going to gravel this up. We're going to do two-tone. Gravel, gravel.

1445
06:04:57,500 --> 06:05:01,099
All the way out. Here we go. We can do it with like sand or graph. We'll do it.

1446
06:05:01,099 --> 06:05:21,020
We'll be fine. Now I can just build this out. It actually might look kind of good.

1447
06:05:22,729 --> 06:05:26,810
It's not going to look bad. That's for sure. It's going to look, you know, you know what I'm

1448
06:05:26,810 --> 06:05:41,930
saying. It might look pretty good. Come out. I wonder if should we do it like that and just

1449
06:05:41,930 --> 06:05:49,830
have the middle there have a little bit. Maybe put something in there and then go across

1450
06:05:49,830 --> 06:06:16,180
here. Let's see what this looks like. This is kind of fucked up looking. That's not going

1451
06:06:16,180 --> 06:06:24,409
to work. It's got to go closer. I'm not sure I can. Can I even go closer with this one?

1452
06:06:25,209 --> 06:06:55,939
I don't think I can. Oh well. I tried. I failed. This can build out here. I think I probably can

1453
06:06:55,939 --> 06:07:15,419
just do this now. Let me see. Is it going to work? What do you guys think? Thank God.

1454
06:07:16,810 --> 06:07:23,659
Thank God it worked. Now we just have to do the skinny one down here.

1455
06:07:25,930 --> 06:07:33,080
He genuinely loves this game. I think it's fun. I mean, all jokes aside, I think it's fun.

1456
06:07:33,720 --> 06:07:46,869
It's not going to take it to the edge, is it? Is there another one that's

1457
06:07:46,869 --> 06:07:56,040
as big as this? I don't think there is. We're just going to have to deal with it.

1458
06:08:00,409 --> 06:08:03,290
There's going to be like a, there'll be the big grill over here or something. You won't even

1459
06:08:03,290 --> 06:08:21,750
know. Yeah, you won't even know. There's like, there'll be a fucking grill right here.

1460
06:08:22,950 --> 06:08:34,279
We'll cap this up with some stone. Now let's see. Stone, sand, gravel. What do we got?

1461
06:08:35,000 --> 06:08:48,810
What do you guys think? Surface, let's see, wood cuttings? Do sand? Let's see what it looks like.

1462
06:09:07,299 --> 06:09:20,680
Looks a little weird, but not horrible. Let's put the gondolas back.

1463
06:09:21,319 --> 06:09:46,090
Gondolas go well. Yeah, they do. They actually really do. Put a nice stream of water in the

1464
06:09:46,090 --> 06:09:58,169
middle. Now you're talking. Now you're talking. That sounds pretty great. I must feel like,

1465
06:10:01,479 --> 06:10:19,380
no. It's not, it's not the same size. I can't build it out anymore. Can I?

1466
06:10:20,180 --> 06:10:29,590
Because essentially I would need one of these on each. Let me see. Although not yet. No,

1467
06:10:29,590 --> 06:10:32,709
don't freak. Don't have to freak out yet. It's possible I can get in there again.

1468
06:10:41,270 --> 06:10:53,930
Dark gray beige. All right. We're good. Thank God. We are good to go. It's going

1469
06:10:53,930 --> 06:11:09,240
to look a little sloppy, but it'll work. Somebody said the pattern's really all over

1470
06:11:09,240 --> 06:11:20,069
the place anyway, so it wouldn't be hard. You can't really tell anyway. The room is ruined.

1471
06:11:20,069 --> 06:11:24,950
What happened? What did I do? Ruin? What's wrong? What's wrong with it?

1472
06:11:24,950 --> 06:11:31,380
There's gonna be a grill there. You're not even gonna, you're not even gonna know.

1473
06:11:31,380 --> 06:11:46,470
There's actually gonna be a bunch of random things in here. So why?

1474
06:11:51,619 --> 06:12:21,419
Oh, now it is ruined, but I can move it up. All right, we're good. I think it's still

1475
06:12:21,419 --> 06:12:38,389
gonna be a little too long though. It's almost like this thing in the middle is not,

1476
06:12:38,389 --> 06:12:47,049
because this is longer, so it almost needs to be longer, but it can't be longer. Maybe

1477
06:12:47,049 --> 06:12:56,090
just bring these forward, but that wouldn't look right. It sounds like I need another

1478
06:12:56,090 --> 06:13:09,590
part of the wall. I can't do that because it's an external wall too. Damn it. It'll be all

1479
06:13:09,590 --> 06:13:14,020
right. Plus I can do a little bit like, I can do some of the crushed stone around here.

1480
06:13:14,659 --> 06:13:19,849
Have like a little path leading off and yeah, we'll be good. We'll be here very much.

1481
06:13:19,849 --> 06:13:34,020
We'll do some crushed stone. Because there's gonna be something here too.

1482
06:13:34,819 --> 06:13:40,009
Mm-hmm. All right, let me, let me ask you guys what's worse. Ready? What's worse?

1483
06:13:40,810 --> 06:14:09,240
That or this? This is better. The sand actually is causing the problem.

1484
06:14:16,540 --> 06:14:27,909
Yeah, it's the sand. It's the sand. Because the middle point is,

1485
06:14:35,450 --> 06:14:42,810
you know, I don't even, you can't even tell. That's fine. Look, take it. Ready?

1486
06:14:42,810 --> 06:14:47,369
If you're walking around, you talk, oh yeah, cool. There's gonna be some stuff here. There'll

1487
06:14:47,369 --> 06:15:14,150
be like a, you won't be able to really tell. Yeah, this is fine. Look, I'll take it. You're

1488
06:15:14,150 --> 06:15:19,099
gonna, I'm gonna take your eyes off it right now. You're not even gonna know that it existed.

1489
06:15:19,099 --> 06:16:00,439
How do you turn them on? Isn't this supposed to be water? Water wall? Lights. Here we go.

1490
06:16:00,439 --> 06:16:16,490
Yellow. We're gonna have like water waves. You won't even be able to know this is going

1491
06:16:16,490 --> 06:17:16,229
on here. Urinals. I just want to see what they did. No. All right, let's build it.

1492
06:17:16,229 --> 06:17:24,729
Let's build it up. Come on. Here we go. Grill. The most expensive one. A bed grill. What?

1493
06:17:24,729 --> 06:17:48,409
Here we go. Take a look. Grill. In the corner. Fire pit. Right here. Bingo. I want a bigger fire

1494
06:17:48,409 --> 06:18:09,000
pit than this. Here it is. I like it. Right there. Get that out there. This needs to be

1495
06:18:09,000 --> 06:18:18,259
over here though. Out further. Like back here. There we go. Nice grill. Got a couple of chairs

1496
06:18:18,259 --> 06:18:25,669
there. Can I turn it on? Turn it on. Talk to the grill. I actually just pressed E.

1497
06:18:25,669 --> 06:18:39,299
All right, now we start to go. Okay, grill. Fire pit. Give me some chairs. Give me some nice

1498
06:18:39,299 --> 06:19:29,529
chairs. Chair. No, we need some better chairs than this. These look all right. All right.

1499
06:19:29,529 --> 06:19:43,180
This chair's ugly. I'm sitting in one of those chairs. What about back it up? Other.

1500
06:19:43,180 --> 06:19:53,959
Ooh, what's this stuff? A sprinkler. I'm sorry, guys. There's only one,

1501
06:19:53,959 --> 06:20:17,450
there's only one starburst that I like. Fod. Furniture. A little table. This is nice.

1502
06:20:17,450 --> 06:20:35,099
This is chic. Got a blue top. Can I connect them? I might want two of these right next

1503
06:20:35,099 --> 06:20:50,729
to each other. All right. Do I have to kneel at this table? It's a table to kneel at.

1504
06:20:50,729 --> 06:20:55,849
Why is everything yellow? Everything's not yellow. Just the house, the chairs,

1505
06:20:57,049 --> 06:21:19,049
half of the plants. I need a little garden back here. Better table than this. This table

1506
06:21:19,049 --> 06:21:31,349
sucks. Just one of these. This is cute. How about one of these ones? Yeah, that's okay.

1507
06:21:31,349 --> 06:21:46,180
Perfect. Now you can eat your burgers over here. That table's way too big. Table alvar.

1508
06:21:51,540 --> 06:22:04,810
Oh, that's nice. Yeah, that's fucking sick. Definitely. Just some stools.

1509
06:22:13,000 --> 06:22:31,000
Take a little breakfast nook. All right. Got the grill. I need like a little table

1510
06:22:31,000 --> 06:22:48,220
here for the grill. Grilling table. Just like one of these. How big is this? Yeah. Boom. Right.

1511
06:22:48,220 --> 06:23:04,500
So you can put like the, you can put his stuff there, his utensils. This is the birdhouse.

1512
06:23:04,500 --> 06:23:12,419
I want to put this like over here. Right at the window. I need some bushes back here. I'm

1513
06:23:12,419 --> 06:23:19,779
going to need bush here, bush there on the back. Just to have a little area to play.

1514
06:23:20,259 --> 06:23:51,740
A red bush or a green bush? Let's go green. Get a couple of red ones in here too.

1515
06:23:52,459 --> 06:24:24,869
Are these ugly? I can't tell if these are ugly or not. Yeah, they are very ugly. I need just a

1516
06:24:24,869 --> 06:24:32,650
standard hedge. Maple trees. Oh, these are nice. I could put a few, like a handful of

1517
06:24:32,650 --> 06:25:07,419
these back here. They're not going to be in pots for very long. Oh, those are huge.

1518
06:25:08,380 --> 06:25:30,540
Those ones are already out there. Ball bush. I'll get to the pool. You want a pool? I'll make you a

1519
06:25:30,540 --> 06:26:15,750
pool. Just hold on a second. Oh, this looks nice. Yeah, you guys, you guys have this already.

1520
06:26:15,750 --> 06:26:26,950
But by the way, who, why is this house yours? This house is not your house. I don't have room

1521
06:26:26,950 --> 06:26:32,819
for a pool actually. Hold on. Yeah. I have enough room for like a kid's pool.

1522
06:26:32,819 --> 06:27:35,619
The pond is bigger than the pool. Yeah, but get this over there. This is the worst backyard

1523
06:27:35,619 --> 06:28:22,459
landscaping ever. I have, I'm just barely getting started. Hold on. I need more yellow.

1524
06:28:23,259 --> 06:28:42,860
I don't need any more yellow. What are you doing? Those flowers are going to get no sun.

1525
06:28:42,860 --> 06:28:59,700
That's fine. They're not real. I do want to get around. I can't, can I reach this one?

1526
06:29:00,500 --> 06:29:46,889
Get back there and reach it. I need to reach this flower. I need to pull it back. I'm not,

1527
06:29:46,889 --> 06:29:59,159
what do you mean pool? I already have a gnome. Did you not see the gnome? Can you find it?

1528
06:29:59,159 --> 06:30:17,080
You sure you can't find it? I need something right here. I'm going to do a line of bushes.

1529
06:30:17,080 --> 06:30:26,650
Small bushes. Just the same bush. A line of them right against those. 0.5 rose bush. Done.

1530
06:30:26,650 --> 06:30:38,790
Bingo. Now this is huge. Um, never mind. Hey, there we go. Better. There it is. Okay. Nice,

1531
06:30:38,790 --> 06:31:08,740
nice, nice. Check this out. Watch this. I'm going for something beautiful here.

1532
06:32:10,549 --> 06:32:49,610
It's terrible. What? No, I, wait, guys, I just typed into Google beautiful garden

1533
06:32:49,610 --> 06:33:12,779
and I'm just trying to replicate it. I'm just trying to replicate beautiful garden. All right.

1534
06:33:12,779 --> 06:33:33,540
I just need just regular bush pleasure. This is plagiarizing a garden. Oh man,

1535
06:33:33,540 --> 06:33:38,180
I can't believe you. I, you know, I thought I liked you. I can't believe you're plagiarizing

1536
06:33:38,180 --> 06:34:01,849
a garden. Where is it? That's close. That's close enough. I can't do another color.

1537
06:34:02,409 --> 06:34:28,939
There we go. Is that right? Not really. No, that looks bad. This used to be a swindle stone

1538
06:34:28,939 --> 06:35:24,069
stream. Yeah, you haven't been around in like four years. Lettuce? There we go. That's just,

1539
06:35:24,069 --> 06:35:45,419
no, this is like candy. I need like dirt or something. It's something here.

1540
06:35:46,380 --> 06:35:53,720
I feel like I'm getting too obsessed with the fact that it's a garden flipper and I'm just

1541
06:35:53,720 --> 06:36:01,020
putting tons of flowers and plants and shit everywhere. I might as well just go to the end

1542
06:36:01,020 --> 06:36:20,630
here. Make a swamp. I don't think I even can. These need to be closer. I have not even

1543
06:36:20,630 --> 06:36:26,819
remotely been inside the house. No, I still need to put grass down here. Hold on. Wait,

1544
06:36:26,900 --> 06:37:14,729
wait, wait, wait. Fuck the grass. Smokers get graveled. Wait, this goes here. My stomach.

1545
06:37:23,270 --> 06:37:28,900
Somebody said graham cracker. That's not even what it looks like.

1546
06:37:36,009 --> 06:37:38,810
That does not look like a graham cracker. I don't know why, but

1547
06:37:39,689 --> 06:37:45,290
it's funny to me for some reason. All right, let me lay grass down in the last few places and

1548
06:37:45,290 --> 06:37:56,020
then we can go in the house. By the way, I don't give a shit about anything inside of this house.

1549
06:37:59,900 --> 06:38:10,229
We're gonna, I spent so much time like out there. It's all right. I'm still going. Anymore

1550
06:38:10,229 --> 06:38:32,419
graham cracker? No, we can do grass here. Give me the roller. Turn the inside of the

1551
06:38:32,419 --> 06:38:37,799
house into a garden as well. I wish you could. You unfortunately cannot bring anything that is

1552
06:38:37,799 --> 06:38:45,849
an outdoor tool inside. I know. And I got that perfectly. First time ever, first try.

1553
06:38:53,830 --> 06:39:06,619
Almost did it again. Oops. Dog house? I know. I'll get the dog. I still have to make a circus.

1554
06:39:07,930 --> 06:39:14,659
I don't have enough land to make a circus. How was I ever gonna do that?

1555
06:39:15,220 --> 06:39:38,979
There's no way I can make a circus. You can do it in the garage. I guess, yeah, I guess

1556
06:39:38,979 --> 06:40:24,700
I could do the circus in the garage. A garage circus. Come on, get the last little bit of grass.

1557
06:40:25,259 --> 06:40:44,409
Right to the door. Come on, right in the corner. Got it. All right, nice. Gravel the house. I

1558
06:40:44,409 --> 06:40:50,680
can't gravel in the house. See, look. The game doesn't let you. The game doesn't want you

1559
06:40:50,680 --> 06:41:03,049
to be able to do that. Oh my god, what the hell. All right, I need to fix this and then

1560
06:41:03,049 --> 06:41:10,060
we can finish up the outside. What was it? It was the two-colored, this one, dark one,

1561
06:41:10,060 --> 06:41:23,959
all the way. Tiny, right. All right, here we go. Done. All right, all right, all right,

1562
06:41:23,959 --> 06:41:29,799
all right, all right. So we got pool, clown pit. I have to still plan all these. I didn't

1563
06:41:29,799 --> 06:41:58,650
even do anything over here. That's fucking hard work. We're far from done. No, I told you

1564
06:41:58,650 --> 06:42:10,740
I wasn't stopping. I'm not stopping till the outside is completely done and there's at least

1565
06:42:10,819 --> 06:42:39,639
a couch inside the house. Don't tell them. Don't tell me what. Don't tell them. I was,

1566
06:42:39,639 --> 06:42:52,330
what are you guys not telling me? I've been playing this for almost seven hours

1567
06:42:53,049 --> 06:43:16,150
and that's the first skill point. I think it's seven hours. Hey, when it gets there,

1568
06:43:16,150 --> 06:43:24,659
I'll have it. That looks all right. Just a little filled in back there. I can put

1569
06:43:24,659 --> 06:43:41,750
something else back here though. Big tree, couple little trees. Just five trees in

1570
06:43:41,750 --> 06:43:46,060
a square meter. I still don't understand this. All right, I'm going to have to do

1571
06:43:46,060 --> 06:43:51,509
something interesting here because I'm not putting any more flowers. Okay, no more flowers,

1572
06:43:52,150 --> 06:44:08,970
no more. I got to, what am I putting here? The dog, the dog stuff. Holy shit. Wait a minute.

1573
06:44:18,860 --> 06:44:30,500
How is this an outdoor cinema? It's, this is just a giant TV. Why, what does this mean

1574
06:44:30,500 --> 06:46:39,659
outdoor? Okay. And then you could build a real life backyard projector. What are you guys

1575
06:46:39,659 --> 06:47:05,380
talking about? What's wrong with the projector? Oh, you talk, you, yeah, but this has to go on

1576
06:47:05,380 --> 06:47:45,209
a table. I'm not just going to sit, $700. All right, hold on. No, give me, no more gravel.

1577
06:47:45,209 --> 06:49:35,849
You're right. What are you doing? Hey, wrong side. Just hold on. You'll see. Give me it.

1578
06:49:35,849 --> 06:49:44,970
Why is this crooked? What? Drive-in movie theater.

1579
06:49:45,930 --> 06:49:58,869
It's a motorcycle, it's a two motorcycle parking lot drive-in movie theater. It's a bicycle drive-up

1580
06:49:58,869 --> 06:50:34,700
movie theater. Yes, it's a bicycle movie theater. And if you want to, you can stop at our garden

1581
06:50:34,700 --> 06:50:52,580
on the way over here. Pull up your fucking bike. I mean, yeah, the bricks, the bricks

1582
06:50:52,580 --> 06:51:35,819
just go another way, but that's fine. Oh, what, what? Why is everybody freaking out?

1583
06:51:35,819 --> 06:51:48,790
I'm just making a little walkway, but that looks much better. What are you talking about?

1584
06:52:07,909 --> 06:52:25,979
What is wrong with this? I don't see the problem here. I'm going to make one more here and you

1585
06:52:25,979 --> 06:53:02,840
can like take a little stroll. You won't let me do gravel. I went too quick. Give me a table.

1586
06:53:03,479 --> 06:53:17,240
What's wrong with the simplicity of grass? Nothing really. Nothing. I see it's a thinner

1587
06:53:17,240 --> 06:53:35,770
table. No, this is fucking ridiculous. Come here. Simple table. There we go.

1588
06:53:36,729 --> 06:54:29,639
Is that level? Okay, here we go. What is a gym rope? Punching bag? The projector's facing the wrong

1589
06:54:29,639 --> 06:56:00,970
way. It's fine. Fresh pizza ready for you. Get this in here. Plant tomatoes. Plant tomatoes.

1590
06:56:02,009 --> 06:56:12,340
That's actually not a bad idea. We want food. Edible plants. What can you put on a pizza?

1591
06:56:12,340 --> 06:56:22,340
Nut grapes. Plums? No. Cherries? No. Apple? Apple? Blueberry? You don't put carrots on a pizza.

1592
06:56:22,340 --> 06:57:04,900
You don't put pumpkin. There are no pineapples, guys. I'm just kidding. Jesus. The eight cents.

1593
06:57:04,900 --> 06:57:30,060
It's not a big deal if I pretend to do this. All right. There you go. Okay. I need something

1594
06:57:30,060 --> 06:57:36,709
here. I need like a tree or something. This is empty over here. Very empty. Besides my little

1595
06:57:36,709 --> 06:57:55,799
dumb walkway. No, I don't think it needs anything. I'm going to put a gazebo. A gazebo will not fit

1596
06:57:55,799 --> 06:58:21,930
here. No, I'm not fucking doing that. Let me make a nice little thing here. Hold on. Let me

1597
06:58:21,930 --> 06:58:39,939
get the wrecked shrubs. The default ones. They look okay. I'm just going to let the brush

1598
06:58:39,939 --> 06:58:48,139
just go on the paper. I'm not going to think about it. Just let the brush flow across the

1599
06:58:48,139 --> 06:59:20,650
canvas. What am I thinking here? Where am I going? Okay, something else. Let's get a nice little

1600
06:59:20,650 --> 07:00:02,939
display here from these little ones. This is what I had before. That's the same one I had before.

1601
07:00:03,659 --> 07:00:17,380
I'm not thinking about it. I'm not thinking about it. Let's just go. I'm not thinking

1602
07:00:17,380 --> 07:00:51,349
about it at all. Okay. I don't think that's that bad. Attention streamer, you have too

1603
07:00:51,349 --> 07:01:05,509
many plants. Oh, I mean the name of this game is Garden Flipper. I'm going to make a huge

1604
07:01:05,509 --> 07:01:19,259
elaborate display. Think of a water bill. This is not called Don't Put Plants Anywhere DLC. This

1605
07:01:19,259 --> 07:01:31,220
is the Garden DLC. I'm going to make an elaborate fucking piece. I'm going to go back over there

1606
07:01:31,220 --> 07:01:58,939
and we'll do some more cleanup. Million dollar sprinkler system. This is it for plants though.

1607
07:01:58,939 --> 07:02:03,340
This is going to be it for plants because then I'm going to put the fucking clown stuff

1608
07:02:03,340 --> 07:02:16,389
in the garage and you'll be happy. Imagine if the neighbor was allergic to pollen.

1609
07:02:17,270 --> 07:02:25,259
He'll be okay. I need to buy one for like a couple of rock or something.

1610
07:02:25,979 --> 07:02:39,259
This is like a lot here. I'm going to move this. This is why you think it's too busy

1611
07:02:39,259 --> 07:03:00,740
because it's too far up. Better. Much better. Maybe a little bit of gravel? No. I think

1612
07:03:00,740 --> 07:03:10,310
that's okay. This needs something in here. Something to take it. Hold on. I need like

1613
07:03:10,310 --> 07:03:13,509
something in here. You're going to be mad about this but I'm just adding a couple more.

1614
07:03:16,650 --> 07:03:42,310
Like one, two. Rocks maybe. Some little ones. No, I think that's all right. This one's

1615
07:03:42,310 --> 07:03:56,470
going to go. That one's fucking the whole thing up and that one and this one and that one

1616
07:03:56,470 --> 07:04:07,529
and that one. What about over here? Something's going to go over here.

1617
07:04:21,959 --> 07:04:25,479
I've never had a house like this. I've never had a garden. I'm just trying to make a

1618
07:04:25,479 --> 07:04:32,409
cool garden. I've never had one before. I've never had a cool garden. Water walls.

1619
07:04:32,409 --> 07:04:39,880
I've never had this much money to make whatever I want. You have five gardens.

1620
07:04:44,360 --> 07:04:55,720
Play some windmill. I've never had a garden before. That looks good. Look at that. That

1621
07:04:55,720 --> 07:05:13,240
kind of ties the whole thing together. Now it's finally mini golf. All right. I'm no more. I'm

1622
07:05:13,240 --> 07:05:18,279
done. I'm losing my fucking mind. Okay. I'm not. No more. I just need to clean this part

1623
07:05:18,360 --> 07:05:44,540
up. Fuck no. I need to tie this together here. I need this because I don't hate this.

1624
07:05:45,340 --> 07:05:52,740
What about a path? I could do a path, but that has to start from over here and yes,

1625
07:05:53,299 --> 07:05:59,659
it will. That's not the right one, mom. Did I say ma? Like calling you guys mom?

1626
07:06:00,380 --> 07:06:07,819
That's not edit. Edit the right one, ma. It's this one, right? Okay. Here it is.

1627
07:06:07,819 --> 07:06:28,169
Let me see what this looks like. Is that right? Is this one?

1628
07:06:29,130 --> 07:07:21,580
Okay. Not bad. Not bad. I gotta, I gotta clean this back up though.

1629
07:07:21,580 --> 07:08:43,830
Because this is now, now this is no longer. Don't need this. Couple more stones. Yes. Give

1630
07:08:43,830 --> 07:08:51,209
us a tour. Not yet. Not done. I'm not done. Not done. Not done. Something's got to be here.

1631
07:08:51,209 --> 07:08:59,779
Something's got to go right here. I'm sorry. It does. That's just the way it is. That space

1632
07:08:59,779 --> 07:09:09,540
is freaking me out. I need something. I need to hide it. Uh, how about it's like a light

1633
07:09:09,540 --> 07:09:28,389
or something. No, no, that's fine. Negative space. You're right. What about one of these

1634
07:09:28,470 --> 07:09:41,000
stones to go away? Much better. 10 times better. See, I am removing things. You guys thought

1635
07:09:41,000 --> 07:10:17,619
I was just throwing shit. I'm removing things. Don't turn it around. I think this is good.

1636
07:10:17,619 --> 07:11:09,000
Put that rock back. No, I can't. Uh, what about here? This feels pretty empty. I don't like any

1637
07:11:09,000 --> 07:11:14,729
of this. I don't like this. I want to redo this whole thing. I don't, this is, I don't

1638
07:11:14,729 --> 07:11:32,150
like this. This is too much open space. There needs to be more of this. I need like a,

1639
07:11:32,150 --> 07:11:46,360
no, that's okay. That's fine. That looks all right. That's better. That's better. I feel much

1640
07:11:46,360 --> 07:12:29,340
better now. A nice lamp. Let's get a big lamp. How big are these? There we go. That's a, uh,

1641
07:12:29,340 --> 07:12:55,959
that is a street lamp. So yeah, nevermind. Is this knuckles? No, I can't put it inside.

1642
07:12:55,959 --> 07:12:58,759
Ball pits are the only thing that can go in here apparently for some reason.

1643
07:12:58,759 --> 07:13:09,180
Can a carousel go in here? Okay, you can. Carousel, the little kid's house,

1644
07:13:09,180 --> 07:13:30,759
little fun playhouse. All right, I gotta assemble it. What's going on? Can't do,

1645
07:13:30,840 --> 07:14:17,560
I can't do that now. What can you not do? This is the garage. I can't put the circus in here.

1646
07:14:17,560 --> 07:14:25,909
No pictures. I want a place for my documents. I think I'm, I'm ready to go inside. Would you

1647
07:14:25,909 --> 07:14:38,490
like a tour of the outside? Not yet. No, no. We get to do the whole thing. Let's make some

1648
07:14:38,490 --> 07:14:44,970
walls here. What do we got? This room sucks. Change it. Uh, this is going to be a bathroom.

1649
07:14:45,900 --> 07:15:02,630
No, closet. Watch this. I don't want that. I don't want, this looks ugly. Let's do some

1650
07:15:02,630 --> 07:15:18,099
paint. I'm thinking light biscuit on the walls. Maybe let's see what light biscuit looks like.

1651
07:15:23,819 --> 07:15:27,580
Yeah, it's been seven hours and 15 minutes and I finally made it inside.

1652
07:15:27,580 --> 07:15:40,659
That was a seven hour garden. Now it's going to be like, this could be a home office.

1653
07:15:41,220 --> 07:16:00,900
Yeah, this is an office. You'll get the whole, the whole tour is going to take like

1654
07:16:00,900 --> 07:16:13,799
25 minutes. It's going to be a long tour. Flesh walls. These are the color of the walls

1655
07:16:13,799 --> 07:16:24,680
in my room right now. This is what it looks like in my room now. A flesh wall. It's a

1656
07:16:26,540 --> 07:16:32,599
yeah, I don't know, tinted cigarette ash, whatever it is. Cigarette. Yeah, I would call this a

1657
07:16:32,599 --> 07:16:46,180
cigarette yellow, like cigarette tar. It works good for an office or a closet. I can reach it.

1658
07:16:46,180 --> 07:17:06,409
I'm fine. Did I just shrink? Did I shrink? Look at me. What? Maybe I should use a scaffolding

1659
07:17:06,409 --> 07:17:14,169
to get to the, that's not, I don't need to do that. Why would I put a scaffolding in the

1660
07:17:14,169 --> 07:17:29,180
house? It is not too high. I'm not going to get shown up here. Too high, huh? All right,

1661
07:17:29,180 --> 07:17:41,930
this wall here, we'll get an accent color. Maybe a, what should I add? What a little accent.

1662
07:17:41,930 --> 07:18:03,450
What do you think? Kappa? Let's see one gray. Why do I need a scaffolding to reach this shit?

1663
07:18:03,450 --> 07:18:11,659
That's so stupid. I have a long pole. Did my, my character shrunk? Okay, what do we want

1664
07:18:11,659 --> 07:18:29,979
for an accent color in here around the windows? Gray? Silver glacier? Steel gray? Purple? Purple?

1665
07:18:32,150 --> 07:19:11,750
Like a lavender or quartz? Lavender. Quartz, quartz, quartz. Um, this looks like a fucking

1666
07:19:11,750 --> 07:19:45,139
jelly donut room. You picked it. I didn't. I mean, I'm, yeah, you guys picked it. Why is

1667
07:19:45,139 --> 07:19:50,740
this wall, I swear to God, this is a weird optical illusion where it looks, I feel like

1668
07:19:50,740 --> 07:20:00,790
I'm shrinking, but I'm tall enough over here, but I'm shrinking over here. This is freaking

1669
07:20:00,790 --> 07:20:19,270
me out a little bit. I'm not going to lie. See, look at, I'm not even, something really

1670
07:20:19,270 --> 07:20:30,060
fucked up is going on. Cause like, I'm tall enough over here? Why is this house, how tall

1671
07:20:30,060 --> 07:20:36,900
are these ceilings? These ceilings are like 30 feet tall. I'm standing on the paint can.

1672
07:20:36,900 --> 07:20:43,509
Okay. All right. Carpet color. The first color I see in chat is the one that's going

1673
07:20:43,509 --> 07:20:48,409
in here. Carpet color. What do you got? First color I see. Don't care what it is. Red.

1674
07:20:48,409 --> 07:21:16,580
Why does that have to be red? Can I even do red? Okay. There's no red. I don't, there's no red.

1675
07:21:16,580 --> 07:21:44,119
So we're going to have to do something else. This looks like shit. No, that looks all right.

1676
07:21:44,119 --> 07:21:59,799
I like that. Oh, I like that because that's, look, that's the wall. Yeah. The blue. All

1677
07:21:59,799 --> 07:22:31,779
right. I'll try the blue. I'll give it another chance. It's all right. What color

1678
07:22:31,779 --> 07:22:40,459
is this carpet? This carpet is like a white with beige, beige, white, a little bit of tan.

1679
07:22:41,099 --> 07:22:53,380
The walls are like a sand. This is a Pee-wee Herman room. All right. Well, this is supposed

1680
07:22:53,380 --> 07:23:02,150
to be, this is the office. So we need a desk. A nice one. The nicest one you can buy. This is

1681
07:23:02,150 --> 07:23:14,490
the desk that I currently have right now. Is there walnut? How could you not have,

1682
07:23:15,049 --> 07:23:36,419
it's on walnut. All right. Okay. Let's get a chair. Office chair. Looks pretty good.

1683
07:23:37,060 --> 07:23:50,700
I like that kind of sandstone look. Computer in here. Good computer. The computer brushy.

1684
07:23:51,340 --> 07:23:58,229
Computer Phoenix. Computer Sphinx. Well, that's the best one we can buy. So we're going to get

1685
07:23:58,229 --> 07:24:16,979
it. Let's get the monitor. So we need more. I mean, a lot of them. We need at least two.

1686
07:24:17,540 --> 07:24:31,479
Okay. I didn't think it was going to be that big. That is a very large monitor.

1687
07:24:37,259 --> 07:24:42,389
Now you're gaming. Yeah, we're dropping a bunch. How are we dropping this many frames at like

1688
07:24:42,549 --> 07:24:51,000
11 o'clock at night? It's like, that doesn't even make sense. We had like seven hours of like

1689
07:24:51,000 --> 07:24:59,979
green internet and now at like 11 PM? What the fuck? Are you serious? This is literally

1690
07:24:59,979 --> 07:25:20,020
my boyfriend's setup. It's an interesting setup. Press C. How long was I crouched for?

1691
07:25:31,700 --> 07:25:51,990
I may have been crouched the whole game. No, I didn't notice because

1692
07:25:54,150 --> 07:26:06,979
you look it. You walk the same speed. You just lower to the ground. That's why I couldn't reach

1693
07:26:06,979 --> 07:26:20,229
the shit like eight hours ago. Oh my god. I'm just gonna finish my office please. All right,

1694
07:26:20,229 --> 07:27:05,459
I need a mouse. And it's in gamer grub with my sardines. Why do I have it in the office

1695
07:27:05,459 --> 07:27:11,639
so I can snack on them? I just mute the microphone. I just start eating. Dwarf soup.

1696
07:27:11,639 --> 07:27:34,360
It's odd. A propane tank under your desk. All right, that's good. We need a little bit

1697
07:27:34,360 --> 07:27:45,049
of a, let's see, furniture. We need, I don't know, maybe like a little bookcase. Yeah,

1698
07:27:45,049 --> 07:27:56,470
this is nice. A little drawer in the corner. What else? What do I have? What's in my office?

1699
07:27:57,270 --> 07:28:25,750
A fuck you table. A closet. There's nothing else in here. There's a keyboard. There's not

1700
07:28:25,750 --> 07:28:35,779
really a whole lot of room for this. All right, well, new plan. You reach over and grab the

1701
07:28:36,740 --> 07:28:47,590
mouse. All right, like at what point, at what point do you just figure out how to

1702
07:28:47,590 --> 07:29:06,740
get, get a smaller monitor? Okay, you have to tilt your head to the left. You need to have

1703
07:29:06,740 --> 07:29:13,610
a windmill in here to power the PC with clean energy. I don't think so. I don't think I'm

1704
07:29:13,610 --> 07:29:27,610
going to do that. All right, we need paint. Living room. Sierra Mist. Young Fly. I like

1705
07:29:27,610 --> 07:29:55,400
this one. Peach. Peach might look alright. Peach or Velvety Peach? Which one? Velvety?

1706
07:29:55,400 --> 07:30:19,080
I'll give it a trial run for you. How about Bright Peach? Let's try that one. It's a little

1707
07:30:19,080 --> 07:31:12,779
lighter. It's better. We're not the same. No. You got to do clown stripes. I just need to

1708
07:31:12,779 --> 07:31:21,029
get a couch in here. The couch is the finishing touch. That means that, that means

1709
07:31:21,029 --> 07:31:37,259
the house is done and we can do our 35 minute tour. What about the ground in here? I'm

1710
07:31:37,340 --> 07:32:03,880
thinking basil. Hey Lois, I'm a clown now. There are no lights. I'll put some lamps in

1711
07:32:03,880 --> 07:32:12,569
here and stuff. No, we're not doing another ice cream shop. This is just going to be

1712
07:32:12,569 --> 07:32:30,729
a regular house. House was so fucked up. It was a mall at the bottom floor, an ice

1713
07:32:30,729 --> 07:32:38,139
cream shop at the top. You guys thought I was on like drugs this stream. What the

1714
07:32:38,139 --> 07:32:55,349
hell was wrong with me on that one? Yeah, this is like standard apartment building.

1715
07:32:55,349 --> 07:33:19,270
It doesn't matter. No, I'm not doing the family guy house. Where did you get

1716
07:33:19,270 --> 07:33:24,599
that information from? Is he really doing the family guy house? Where'd you get that

1717
07:33:24,599 --> 07:33:47,819
info? I didn't say that. That's not info from me. Am I still doing this? Yeah,

1718
07:33:47,819 --> 07:33:52,680
this is, this is, this is going to be a long one. This will be at least, this is

1719
07:33:52,680 --> 07:33:57,770
going to be like at least a nine hour stream at least. Hey, I've got the internet.

1720
07:33:57,770 --> 07:34:22,380
I'm going to use it. Skill point. Max upgraded painting. That's quick. Have a

1721
07:34:22,380 --> 07:34:27,700
few stripes to break it up. Yeah, but once I get it all painted, we'll do a

1722
07:34:27,779 --> 07:34:36,860
little bit of a detail work. I'm not kidding. It does look like the family guy

1723
07:34:36,860 --> 07:34:52,009
house even from the inside. Oh my God. Oh my God. It is the family guy house.

1724
07:34:52,009 --> 07:35:03,270
Here's the door that like and then this couch and the TV and the stairs

1725
07:35:03,270 --> 07:35:20,090
and then the kitchen. It's the family guy. Somebody look right now. I don't

1726
07:35:20,090 --> 07:35:23,610
know how you can do this. Is there a door right here next, right here to

1727
07:35:23,689 --> 07:35:39,509
the front door? This is not, no. So it's not the family guy house. See all these

1728
07:35:39,509 --> 07:35:48,040
similarities. You just, you're making them up in your head. Holy crap, Lois.

1729
07:35:48,040 --> 07:36:09,020
It's the famous streamer, German nine eight five. Oh God. Where's Chris's

1730
07:36:09,020 --> 07:36:12,779
room? No, I'm not doing that. I don't care.

1731
07:36:23,240 --> 07:36:27,639
I'm an orange hell right now, but you have to wait. I have to break it

1732
07:36:27,639 --> 07:36:31,720
up and do accent work. Yes, you're currently in orange hell, but this is

1733
07:36:31,720 --> 07:36:37,819
what painters do. They get ready and then they finish with other colors.

1734
07:36:41,319 --> 07:36:43,880
It's not. It's not. All right. All right. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait,

1735
07:36:43,880 --> 07:36:54,020
wait. I'm thinking like a darker purple or like a white. No, a white

1736
07:36:54,020 --> 07:37:25,959
guys. It's going to be white. This is ultra generic. Well, we have to

1737
07:37:25,959 --> 07:37:29,799
mute it a little bit because look at the fucking clown circus that's outside.

1738
07:37:31,380 --> 07:37:38,619
We have to have the normal house on the inside and this is too boring for

1739
07:37:38,619 --> 07:37:55,590
you. Is it too boring? I'm not going to do rainbow walls. You guys are

1740
07:37:55,590 --> 07:38:07,959
fucking crazy. What a shitty house that would be. I would throw up in every

1741
07:38:07,959 --> 07:38:10,680
room. If every room was a rainbow, it would just be like, you wouldn't be

1742
07:38:10,680 --> 07:38:16,900
able to look at it. He's doubling down on being boring now because the

1743
07:38:16,900 --> 07:38:40,650
outside was so fucked up. I'm, I'm sorry. Here you go. You want your

1744
07:38:40,650 --> 07:38:45,619
fucking, you want your donut house here. Each room is themed around a

1745
07:38:45,619 --> 07:39:24,919
different fucking filling. Yeah, this is strawberry. Now you're pandering.

1746
07:39:24,919 --> 07:39:29,400
Actually, I kind of like this. I really actually like what I just did

1747
07:39:29,400 --> 07:39:45,430
over here. I do. I do. I actually don't mind that at all. All right,

1748
07:39:45,430 --> 07:39:49,909
so let's take a look. Although I could have it without. I could do

1749
07:39:49,909 --> 07:39:54,970
without on this wall. Yeah, no. In fact, we're going to go from there.

1750
07:39:54,970 --> 07:40:03,959
We're going to go to sunny orange. It is a circus tent. Oh fuck, whatever.

1751
07:40:06,490 --> 07:40:23,430
It's not a circus tent. It's not a circus tent. A circus tent doesn't

1752
07:40:23,430 --> 07:40:30,409
look like this. It's a house. A house standing on four legs,

1753
07:40:32,020 --> 07:40:46,299
breathing pure oxygen. That's too much. Uh, it's got to be a morning

1754
07:40:46,299 --> 07:40:50,389
yellow. Let me see what the, let me see what the red actually looks

1755
07:40:50,389 --> 07:41:29,159
like over here. It might not look terrible. Try blue. What kind of blue?

1756
07:41:29,159 --> 07:41:54,889
Like a light blue, dark blue, like a royal blue. That looks good.

1757
07:42:04,709 --> 07:42:14,040
Family guy blue. No, family guy blue is a little darker than this.

1758
07:42:19,529 --> 07:42:22,409
You guys are fucking hilarious. I swear to God.

1759
07:42:23,689 --> 07:42:31,290
Stewie's room. How do you even remember that? How do I don't even

1760
07:42:31,290 --> 07:42:40,470
know what that, how do you even remember this? That seems almost

1761
07:42:40,470 --> 07:42:52,279
impossible to remember. Why is no door leading to the yard? Because

1762
07:42:53,430 --> 07:42:57,990
as of right now, I had to put down these and they've been getting in the way.

1763
07:42:57,990 --> 07:43:04,700
So I had to pull them up. We watch family guys so we can make the

1764
07:43:04,700 --> 07:43:11,639
references on your stream. Well, nice job. You got it. Those are pretty good references.

1765
07:43:22,740 --> 07:43:31,610
This needs to be redone. Is this the right color? No. Residrator. Right there.

1766
07:43:32,569 --> 07:43:45,619
I mean, yellow and, I mean, blue and brown go together very well. They just do.

1767
07:43:46,740 --> 07:43:57,240
Tons of schemes are with blue and brown. Let's get some appliances in here.

1768
07:43:57,240 --> 07:44:05,110
No, we can look at a tile of ground. Floor, floor tile for the kitchen.

1769
07:44:13,430 --> 07:44:17,270
Uh, we could do checkerboard. We could do, is there a beige?

1770
07:44:18,299 --> 07:44:51,580
This one? Sepia? That's giving me a headache. How about this one? Not bad. Could be worse.

1771
07:44:51,580 --> 07:45:16,060
Something's going on over there. It's a bathroom. I'm not going to have a brick

1772
07:45:16,060 --> 07:45:27,240
bathroom. No, this is Rocco's Modern Life. It's really easy for a house to turn into

1773
07:45:27,240 --> 07:45:40,970
Rocco's Modern Life in this game. Uh, let's just go with this one. Just wood. Wood floors.

1774
07:45:41,610 --> 07:46:09,240
Looks good. Except for over here. Now the paint doesn't match.

1775
07:46:09,799 --> 07:46:16,419
Well, I'm going to do, uh, let's see. What am I going to do? A carpet in here?

1776
07:46:16,419 --> 07:46:21,700
I'm thinking a, one of these. Let's see how this looks.

1777
07:46:23,500 --> 07:46:45,979
What is this doing? This is the carpet in this room right now.

1778
07:46:45,979 --> 07:46:57,220
No, let's go with, um, rug gray. Rug pattern. Rug gray. Let's try the gray.

1779
07:46:57,220 --> 07:47:18,439
What? Oh, these are just rugs. Floor panels and coverings. I mean, pine.

1780
07:47:18,439 --> 07:47:32,060
I just do wood through the whole house. What's, what's, what's, what's with millennials

1781
07:47:32,700 --> 07:47:47,259
and wooden floors? What's going on there? That's a millennial thing. I want the, the high,

1782
07:47:47,900 --> 07:47:54,009
the, not the low cut. I want like the really fabric-y carpet around my whole house.

1783
07:47:54,009 --> 07:48:13,880
The long haired carpet. Carpet is disgusting, revolting. Yeah. But when you walk around on wood,

1784
07:48:15,000 --> 07:48:21,209
everybody in the whole house can hear you. It's, it's boom, boom, boom, boom. You're like an

1785
07:48:21,209 --> 07:48:52,330
elephant up there. Carpets. It's like, it's funny. I'm, I'm being like a fake internet troll

1786
07:48:52,330 --> 07:49:00,119
right now because I love wooden floors. I'm just being one of those just like fucking

1787
07:49:00,119 --> 07:49:03,080
accounts that just goes on and just says whatever the, it's just anything that they

1788
07:49:03,080 --> 07:49:07,159
do. Anything to like get sort of be like, what the fuck are you talking about?

1789
07:49:07,720 --> 07:49:13,860
I'm just like a LARP. Yeah. I'm LARPing right now. Dark wooden floors are my

1790
07:49:13,860 --> 07:49:34,729
favorite thing in the world. They really are. You guys are making me like laugh too.

1791
07:49:36,009 --> 07:49:41,299
What's with like the comedy troupe here? You guys have been like on point today with like

1792
07:49:41,299 --> 07:49:55,290
the comedy. All right, let's go. Please put more in the computer room. I will. Don't worry.

1793
07:49:55,290 --> 07:50:02,299
I will. I will. Let me just get this down. Got doors here. This is closed.

1794
07:50:02,860 --> 07:50:32,299
I gotta put the other doors on here. I'm going to do dark. Nevermind. Can this not fit?

1795
07:50:36,220 --> 07:50:48,540
Why can this not fit? It's because of this shit right here. The lip. It's all right. I got it.

1796
07:50:48,540 --> 07:51:03,590
I got it in. Hungry. What do I eat? I'm hungry. I'm forcing myself to stay awake to

1797
07:51:03,590 --> 07:51:09,669
watch you. Don't fuck it up. I won't. Do you see the garden that I made?

1798
07:51:10,470 --> 07:51:22,939
You're in good hands here. All right. Computer room. Bathroom. Eat the sandwich that's been

1799
07:51:22,939 --> 07:51:30,619
in the car for eight months. I don't even have that car. I don't have that sandwich.

1800
07:51:31,799 --> 07:51:56,389
I'm not at that house. So many windows here. What is seriously with the windows?

1801
07:51:57,110 --> 07:52:17,020
Is the window? They're everywhere. This house is so bizarre. Tile. Wall tile. Hmm.

1802
07:52:19,189 --> 07:52:31,529
I'm interested in what this does. Let's see. All right. Yeah. I didn't even give you a warning

1803
07:52:31,529 --> 07:52:35,779
on that one. I'm sorry. I didn't have a warning. Why am I sneezing so much today?

1804
07:52:38,549 --> 07:52:57,020
I don't sneeze this much ever. The carpet. No. It's not the carpet. What do I feel like

1805
07:52:57,020 --> 07:53:03,979
eating? Dude, am I going to get a pizza? I'm going to give you guys a little bit of an

1806
07:53:03,979 --> 07:53:10,709
insight here. I know that people think I eat pizza every day because I always say,

1807
07:53:10,709 --> 07:53:14,470
you know what? I'm thinking about a pepperoni pizza. I don't, I don't do it. I don't get it.

1808
07:53:19,990 --> 07:53:26,500
Like three out of six streams. I say I'm going to get a pepperoni pizza delivered to the house.

1809
07:53:27,540 --> 07:53:47,580
You guys must think I'm like a sicko. I actually, I like this. This looks nice.

1810
07:53:47,580 --> 07:53:59,080
Just need a bathtub. Thinking about eating pizza is not weird. No, but saying I'm going to

1811
07:53:59,080 --> 07:54:05,779
eat pizza every day is a little weird. And then I go downstairs and I have like spinach

1812
07:54:05,779 --> 07:54:15,049
and pasta. I was thinking about getting a pepperoni pizza today. I am hungry though.

1813
07:54:16,740 --> 07:54:31,159
Am I going eight hours here? A quick question. I've only left this room one time in eight hours.

1814
07:54:31,720 --> 07:54:46,259
Is that true? Yeah, that did happen. Okay. All right. Yeah. I went to go get a glass of wine

1815
07:54:46,259 --> 07:54:54,419
like seven hours ago. Let me go pee and like get some water and maybe grab a snack.

1816
07:54:57,939 --> 07:55:08,360
I'll be right back. Didn't even pee. Yeah. No, I'll be right back. We'll finish up here.

1817
07:55:10,220 --> 07:57:55,159
See you very, very soon. Literally walked downstairs and Kim made pasta. He was already

1818
07:57:55,159 --> 07:58:04,180
ready. Beautiful. Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful. So I'm going to be a piece of crap

1819
07:58:04,180 --> 07:58:16,580
and I'm going to mute and paint walls. She's wonderful. Yes, she is. Oh, let's try this.

1820
07:58:17,139 --> 07:58:24,040
Paint the walls with pasta. Don't mute. No, I'm going to mute.

1821
07:58:25,909 --> 07:58:30,470
But 20% of the people that think this is funny, 80% of the people think this is

1822
07:58:30,470 --> 07:59:14,549
the worst thing they've ever heard in their life. It feels weird to sit here. I can't do it.

1823
07:59:14,549 --> 07:59:24,330
I'm so used to just talking. They're just staring at this. Hey, what's up? You guys

1824
07:59:24,330 --> 07:59:48,630
just hanging out too? I'm doing the equivalent of keyboard turning in World of Warcraft.

1825
07:59:48,630 --> 08:00:25,540
I'm playing with one hand. How's the pasta? I haven't even tried it. Let me try it.

1826
08:00:25,540 --> 08:00:59,450
Let's get a piece on here. Oh! What? Oh! It's the noise of all those bones breaking.

1827
08:01:01,799 --> 08:01:15,900
I can't even say this because that wouldn't even do it.

1828
08:01:18,340 --> 08:01:43,770
Cad said toenail in the pasta. Why would it make that loud of a noise? No, that was,

1829
08:01:44,490 --> 08:01:51,560
that was somebody dumped sand into your pasta. A lot of it. A point where you can visibly

1830
08:01:51,560 --> 08:02:34,900
see it on the plate. Let's go back to it. Sand pasta. That's disgusting. Just disgusting.

1831
08:02:35,540 --> 08:02:47,590
What was I doing with this? Oh, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right.

1832
08:02:47,590 --> 08:02:57,990
Then what should I do for the ground? What do I think? By the way, upstairs is going to be

1833
08:02:57,990 --> 08:03:03,529
just a giant bedroom. There's going to be a bed at the end of the hall and a bunch of

1834
08:03:03,529 --> 08:03:17,419
potted plants. Nice. I always hate when people have windows into the bathrooms. Especially,

1835
08:03:18,220 --> 08:03:21,419
maybe some of you guys have a house like this. If you go to somebody's house,

1836
08:03:21,419 --> 08:03:30,709
just making sure it wasn't crushed, who has a window in the bathroom at penile level where

1837
08:03:30,709 --> 08:03:38,150
you're peeing and there's a window that is at, it's like, it's at like balls level.

1838
08:03:39,860 --> 08:03:43,779
If that thing is not closed, if there's no curtain or even curtains, I feel like

1839
08:03:43,779 --> 08:03:52,520
somebody could see right through it. That's way more common than you think it is. I have

1840
08:03:52,520 --> 08:04:00,650
this weird fucked up fear of peeing in somebody's house that has a penile window.

1841
08:04:00,650 --> 08:04:08,700
And for some reason, I just think like the curtain or the blinds, somebody, you know how,

1842
08:04:08,700 --> 08:04:12,619
you don't have to go far enough away from blinds. You can kind of see a little bit.

1843
08:04:12,619 --> 08:04:16,340
I just have to feel like somebody is going to see right through one of the little cracks

1844
08:04:16,340 --> 08:04:25,509
of a Venetian blind and just see my penis. They don't even need to see me. They might

1845
08:04:25,509 --> 08:04:29,990
not even know who's in the bathroom. And like, I get out of the bathroom and it could have been

1846
08:04:29,990 --> 08:04:42,759
anybody. But that's, I don't like that. I don't like that. That's just, I don't want that.

1847
08:04:54,580 --> 08:05:08,099
He likes that. I don't like that. I don't like that. But it is, it is a little bizarre

1848
08:05:11,770 --> 08:05:26,279
when you go to a bathroom that is like that. Okay, almost done with the bathroom.

1849
08:05:40,599 --> 08:05:48,540
What are these doing need? Do they only, no, I'm just saying like through one of the

1850
08:05:48,540 --> 08:05:53,779
little blinds, they just, you know what I mean. This is a PG-13 stream. We don't have

1851
08:05:53,779 --> 08:06:15,340
to get into our related details. Yes, we do. No, we don't. PG-13 is not family friendly.

1852
08:06:15,340 --> 08:06:24,619
They say the F word. They say the S word. They say mean things. It's the same. Yeah.

1853
08:06:24,619 --> 08:06:31,639
You can say fuck at least once in a, yeah, you can say fuck one time in a PG-13 movie.

1854
08:06:31,639 --> 08:06:57,830
That's new. He did it twice. Oh no. All right. Remind me to not tile a wall ever again.

1855
08:06:57,830 --> 08:07:19,159
This takes as long as it takes to eat a bowl of pasta. It's a long time. A very long

1856
08:07:19,159 --> 08:07:36,939
time. Done. All right. So let's take another bite. I'm going to make the bathtub shower

1857
08:07:36,939 --> 08:08:15,159
and sink in the bathroom. Hmm. This is like a weird digital pixel room. I don't like it,

1858
08:08:15,159 --> 08:08:26,119
but whatever Stan. Actually trash. All right. Let's do a shower. Shower plumbing system.

1859
08:08:26,759 --> 08:08:41,500
What is this? Oh, we have to, oh, do you remember when I was talking about this game

1860
08:08:43,689 --> 08:08:47,209
and how I said that I really wish that it was, everything was pre-installed, everything.

1861
08:08:47,849 --> 08:08:56,330
This is like a year ago when we played this last. You couldn't do that before. Now you can.

1862
08:08:56,889 --> 08:09:02,540
So that's good. You can actually place the shower where you want to, not where they

1863
08:09:02,540 --> 08:09:39,779
deem it necessary. That's cool. It's a good change. A lot of sauce on this one. No, I'm

1864
08:09:39,779 --> 08:09:53,560
talking about on my pasta. That was a saucy one. I don't have a right flush against the

1865
08:09:53,560 --> 08:10:06,650
wall. Yeah, it's all right though. It's okay. In case like water gets back there and mold gets

1866
08:10:06,650 --> 08:10:23,900
back there, you can throw a towel back and drag it. Get a little mold. Beautiful toilet.

1867
08:10:23,900 --> 08:11:00,580
This game saves all the time now. Hmm. Ooh, this is nice. I need a mount. I need a mount

1868
08:11:00,580 --> 08:11:38,459
for the sink. Where's the mount for the sink? There it is. There. Okay. Now we can get that

1869
08:11:38,459 --> 08:11:49,080
cool sink. What was it down here? Yeah, this one's nice. No, no, that's not the one.

1870
08:11:51,700 --> 08:12:05,819
Here it is. I like this. It's got a weird bowl. I like it. Yeah, this is kind of a restaurant

1871
08:12:05,819 --> 08:12:10,729
bathroom. It's true. That's all right. Restaurant bathrooms are fucking awesome.

1872
08:12:11,369 --> 08:12:33,979
What do you mean? Incorrect? A nice restaurant's bathroom is really, really awesome

1873
08:12:34,700 --> 08:12:40,819
when they have these cool sinks all over the place. You don't think that

1874
08:12:41,540 --> 08:13:24,409
nice restaurants, bathrooms? I'm not talking about a Burger King. Toilet. A flatty or a standard.

1875
08:13:24,409 --> 08:13:41,290
I'll go with a flatty. Two toilets, two toilets. Yeah. You guys don't like that? I mean,

1876
08:13:42,090 --> 08:13:47,779
you guys use the same toilet every day? I usually use a different toilet every other day.

1877
08:13:48,580 --> 08:13:57,770
Keep the other one clean. I would have a toilet for every day of the week if I could.

1878
08:14:04,700 --> 08:14:08,380
All right, bathroom. Let's get some stuff in here. One for each cheek.

1879
08:14:09,340 --> 08:14:13,419
If that were the case, then you would just go right down in the middle.

1880
08:14:14,540 --> 08:14:23,340
If these were right next to each other, you would just go straight down.

1881
08:14:25,779 --> 08:14:32,220
Millionaires just buy a new mansion when theirs get dirty. Yeah, you don't have to be a

1882
08:14:32,220 --> 08:15:03,110
millionaire. They have two toilets in the same bathroom. Why does this stink so much? It's a

1883
08:15:03,110 --> 08:15:59,259
sink. Well, I heard the word restaurant bathroom, and then I got thinking, this house

1884
08:15:59,259 --> 08:16:07,880
sucks. And there's no, there's no room for another bathroom. Upstairs, there's not gonna

1885
08:16:07,880 --> 08:16:34,659
be, there's a, there's a, it's bedroom, bedrooms. I have a toilet to the kitchen.

1886
08:16:39,860 --> 08:16:46,200
The possibilities do open themselves up though. I have a toilet as each seat at

1887
08:16:46,200 --> 08:17:03,430
the dining room table. I think that's a good idea. That looks good. There's no mirror.

1888
08:17:11,720 --> 08:17:30,380
Uh, only one person gets a mirror. Actually, you can have one too. You, uh, just get to look

1889
08:17:30,380 --> 08:17:41,349
out the window. Okay, so this is the bathroom. The two stalls and the shower. This person doesn't

1890
08:17:41,349 --> 08:17:52,500
have very much privacy on this side, but, uh, you're okay. All right, so now let's get the

1891
08:17:54,520 --> 08:19:06,200
dining room table set up. Too far, right here. End of the stream. Joke. This is the end.

1892
08:19:06,759 --> 08:19:20,779
It's the end of the stream. I should have bought a table first. Hey, Lois!

1893
08:19:24,040 --> 08:19:32,310
We should put toilets in the dining room. Oh, freaking genius. Oh my fucking God.

1894
08:19:35,459 --> 08:19:36,740
That was fucking hilarious.

1895
08:19:41,689 --> 08:19:45,189
This is a nine, yeah, we've been going on eight and a half hours here.

1896
08:19:45,270 --> 08:19:56,819
This is a long one. This is a long one. Stop going through with it. It's too late now. Look,

1897
08:19:56,819 --> 08:20:29,029
I can easily just point a money gun at this and turn it off. Let's go black. Now it's a

1898
08:20:29,029 --> 08:21:02,419
torture house. Why would it be a torture house now? Okay, these are all the couches that are

1899
08:21:02,419 --> 08:21:31,639
in the game. This is that. This is a big couch. I don't think it was that big. Okay,

1900
08:21:31,639 --> 08:21:52,459
let's get, um, it's all right. Let's get a bookcase. Uh, this one here. Just to, you

1901
08:21:52,459 --> 08:22:05,779
know, brighten it up a little bit. A bag and a painting. What do you think? What's a good

1902
08:22:05,779 --> 08:22:36,970
painting? What do you guys like? Which one? The pink trees? Yeah, I agree. Look at this

1903
08:22:36,970 --> 08:23:10,619
little place. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Fridge. What is this? Oh, I thought this was a walk-in fridge.

1904
08:23:10,619 --> 08:23:25,669
I was like, what the fuck? That would be awesome. Oh, there's the red fridge.

1905
08:23:26,389 --> 08:23:53,860
Somebody wanted this really bad. Now you got it. Stove. All right, you need to have.

1906
08:23:53,860 --> 08:24:10,090
All right. I forgot. That's an old stove. Stanley fan. Nice. Looking good. Yeah. I'm

1907
08:24:10,090 --> 08:24:23,020
gonna put it on the counter. I'm in a sink. Mm-hmm. LOL. That was funny. All right,

1908
08:24:23,020 --> 08:24:41,529
let's get a counter. What the fuck is this? What the fuck is this? Get it up there.

1909
08:24:47,779 --> 08:25:17,049
Yes! Wow. I need like a little ladder. And I have an outdoor deck here. All right,

1910
08:25:17,049 --> 08:25:26,060
let me get some of the, hold on, some furniture. Like a chair, couch. Couple of

1911
08:25:26,060 --> 08:25:37,750
these things. These things are interesting, I guess, right? Yeah, some of these. Get a few

1912
08:25:37,750 --> 08:26:01,110
of them. This is a sick like recreation pool room. Hold on. And a gymnasium. Gym shit. Cross

1913
08:26:01,110 --> 08:26:23,479
trainer. That's fine like that. I can't put this inside. Outdoor gym. Okay, I need a bed.

1914
08:26:25,270 --> 08:26:32,759
This is not like the big pool room. And I'm painting up here like lightning electric rain.

1915
08:26:42,860 --> 08:26:50,200
Spring grass. Can the bed go on the balcony? I don't think I can put inside things outside

1916
08:26:50,200 --> 08:27:26,119
and outside things inside. Got it. Stop chewing. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm trying to discreetly do

1917
08:27:26,119 --> 08:27:54,259
it without anybody hearing me. Let's glitch to a well. Just painting over cinder blocks.

1918
08:27:54,259 --> 08:28:15,369
Kind of. Kind of, yes. That is true. Okay. No drywall. No, drywall. That's not really in the

1919
08:28:15,369 --> 08:28:29,880
game. You just pick what you want and do it. I actually like that color. This is a nice pool

1920
08:28:29,880 --> 08:28:46,549
color. Why does the paint make that noise? It's actually very accurate. It is shockingly

1921
08:28:46,549 --> 08:29:12,099
accurate to what it sounds like. Get those paint cans. We're getting close. Maybe like another 20,

1922
08:29:12,099 --> 08:29:16,599
30 minutes and we're going to be ready for the tour. And then I want to compare. I want

1923
08:29:16,599 --> 08:29:21,619
to watch a clip. I'm going to walk the same path that I walked in the clip. Do we have a

1924
08:29:21,619 --> 08:29:25,799
clip of when I did it? I want to watch it and then walk the same path. I want to put

1925
08:29:25,799 --> 08:29:51,860
it on screen and do it at the same time. Almost empty. He's going to react. Yeah,

1926
08:29:51,860 --> 08:30:14,040
I'm going to react to my own clip. I'm having a weird spot. I like the pool room.

1927
08:30:18,169 --> 08:30:26,180
It's a $12,000 pool. Seriously, if I don't get $600,000 or $700,000 with this house,

1928
08:30:26,900 --> 08:30:43,750
I'm going to be pretty upset. Let's do that thing again. Uh-oh. I think we're doing too

1929
08:30:43,750 --> 08:30:56,150
many assets in the game. It's starting to freak out. I have like 150 assets outside.

1930
08:30:56,150 --> 08:31:23,700
I might be slowing the engine down. I just saw the family guy clip from earlier and

1931
08:31:23,700 --> 08:31:28,900
wow. What do you mean? Why are you seeing that? Who is linking that to you?

1932
08:31:29,700 --> 08:31:41,099
You guys are already sharing that?

1933
08:31:59,369 --> 08:32:31,400
That's a lot. People will be mad if I miss these. It's happened before. All right,

1934
08:32:31,400 --> 08:32:35,220
one more wall and that's it. And then I got to put a bed downstairs.

1935
08:32:35,299 --> 08:33:01,830
Be mad. Why are you? Why? My clip has 66 views. Yeah, but I was doing like a dumb ironic stupid

1936
08:33:01,830 --> 08:33:07,909
like look at my Peter Griffin. I know how to do Peter Griffin. That's not my actual Peter

1937
08:33:07,909 --> 08:33:32,299
Griffin. That's not fair. Ironic. That was being ironic. The new slap. Hey, you don't

1938
08:33:32,299 --> 08:33:36,630
think that shit's intentional? Now I got some embarrassing fucking thing that you guys are all

1939
08:33:36,630 --> 08:33:41,930
sharing. No one's talking about the slap anymore. Pretty good tactic, don't you think?

1940
08:34:03,959 --> 08:34:14,389
All right, our pool room is done. Just need a bed and the floor needs to be done. It's

1941
08:34:14,389 --> 08:34:20,549
gonna be tile up here. If it's a pool, it's gonna be like that pool tile. Like this stuff

1942
08:34:21,270 --> 08:34:39,400
right here. It's not floor tile. God damn it. I thought it was floor. Floor tile. This one

1943
08:34:39,400 --> 08:35:01,139
looks kind of like a pool. No, it kind of sucks. This one? A little bit better. No,

1944
08:35:01,139 --> 08:35:26,549
it's gotta be white. Just classic white. White tile. That's better. You need to have stairs.

1945
08:35:26,549 --> 08:35:37,479
Yeah, I'll put stairs in the pool so you can get up and get up. How much is this costing?

1946
08:35:37,479 --> 08:36:14,490
A lot of money actually. Why do you have a YMCA in your house? Why not? Almost done.

1947
08:36:14,490 --> 08:36:27,540
Kind of awkward because I can't really reach in here. Over here. I'm no longer worth half

1948
08:36:27,540 --> 08:36:34,470
a million. I will be very soon once I sell this place. All right, I can't paint this because it

1949
08:36:34,470 --> 08:36:44,950
is glitched out, but here we go. Nice little pool. Let's actually put this in a different spot.

1950
08:36:46,150 --> 08:37:00,860
I have more room over here. Are we doing the same house? Yeah, we've been on the same house

1951
08:37:00,860 --> 08:37:10,490
for just about nine hours. I've spent what some would consider an entire day on this

1952
08:37:10,490 --> 08:37:36,810
house. An entire day. A whole day. I couldn't be happier with the outcome. What's the most

1953
08:37:36,810 --> 08:38:01,580
expensive painting you have in the game? That's actually pretty cheap. Upload a photo. I did that

1954
08:38:01,580 --> 08:38:21,639
last time and you can make it like 200 million dollars. I thought that was going to be a lot

1955
08:38:21,639 --> 08:38:44,150
bigger. All right. No, we're not going out there yet. You can't see out there. Let's get some

1956
08:38:44,150 --> 08:38:58,919
lights in here. Lamp. Go just like a standard cube lamp. This is fine. Make it like blue to

1957
08:38:58,919 --> 08:39:19,259
match the room. Wait, I need the stove counter. No, I'm not doing a second pool.

1958
08:39:22,790 --> 08:39:31,939
Um, what's it even called? Furniture? Installations? Kitchen? What is it?

1959
08:39:32,659 --> 08:39:47,130
Kitchen cabinet. Here we go. I was saying counter. That looks nice. Let's get a stove in here.

1960
08:39:47,130 --> 08:40:11,909
Let's get, yeah, let's get two of these. Let's do three. Get the stove on there. All right.

1961
08:40:11,909 --> 08:40:45,419
Pretty cool. Wait, why does it look odd? I already have a pizza oven. I don't need

1962
08:40:45,419 --> 08:40:55,939
none. All right. Let's get a light in here. Lamp. Skunk ball. Let's get a few of them

1963
08:40:55,939 --> 08:41:06,810
right up here. These are ugly. These are very ugly, but it's okay. It is light. That's all

1964
08:41:06,810 --> 08:41:14,520
that matters. And I got a lamp there. Let's get some recessed lighting up here, please. Thank

1965
08:41:14,520 --> 08:42:17,500
you. Tube. There we go. This place is ugly as sin. Any lights in here? Yeah, there are.

1966
08:42:17,500 --> 08:42:27,779
This is very ugly. It's very, very, very ugly. But, you know, we're at the end here.

1967
08:42:27,779 --> 08:42:38,729
I'm kind of tired. So are we gonna have a very ugly house? It's okay. It still looks all right.

1968
08:42:38,729 --> 08:43:01,880
It still looks good. All right. Are we ready for the tour? It's time. And I want to do this

1969
08:43:01,880 --> 08:43:07,610
at night and I want to do this at dark. Reverse that. I want to, okay. I want to do

1970
08:43:07,610 --> 08:43:10,569
this at night. I want to do this during the day. Don't look! Nobody look! Don't look at

1971
08:43:10,569 --> 08:43:25,419
nobody look. Okay. I want it to be daytime. There's no lighting in the garden. Oh, it

1972
08:43:25,419 --> 08:44:19,750
doesn't matter. Bed. Bed. I need a bed. Come on. I need just a little thing. There we go.

1973
08:44:19,750 --> 08:44:44,360
Perfect. Nice. Very nice. Wait, that door's open. Doors are closed. Closed. Closed. Closed.

1974
08:44:44,360 --> 08:45:01,500
Closed. Closed. Okay, here we go. All right. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us.

1975
08:45:01,500 --> 08:45:16,790
I'm not gonna play the family guy theme. No. There's the before clip. Let me see it. Oh,

1976
08:45:16,790 --> 08:45:22,330
it looks like shit. I'm just gonna have this loop silently so you can understand what's

1977
08:45:22,330 --> 08:45:44,729
going on here. Let me just get it on screen. Did anybody get any? I really do want like

1978
08:45:44,729 --> 08:45:47,130
screenshots though. So I'm gonna put time into this. I'm gonna make this real.

1979
08:45:51,240 --> 08:46:09,299
All right. Here is the before. Take a look at this dump. Trash everywhere. Boards. The whole

1980
08:46:09,299 --> 08:46:17,240
thing was condemned. Weeds growing all over the place. It was uninhabitable. This is the front

1981
08:46:17,240 --> 08:46:26,580
door right here. Dumpster over here on the right-hand side. You've got just dead grass.

1982
08:46:26,580 --> 08:46:42,330
Looks terrible. I was ashamed. But now. But now I am no longer ashamed. Here's what we have

1983
08:46:42,330 --> 08:47:02,380
here now. Let's take a walk to that right side where that dumpster was. Remember that dumpster?

1984
08:47:02,380 --> 08:47:11,830
Now it is a stone walkway with a nice picnic area for you and your kids. All that trash.

1985
08:47:11,830 --> 08:47:21,689
Nice fresh grass. We have a windmill farm here in the garden taking us to the right.

1986
08:47:22,330 --> 08:47:29,340
Some more little flowers there. Fucking door was open. When I do my tours,

1987
08:47:30,299 --> 08:47:36,229
you close all the goddamn doors. Through here we have the viewing area. This used to be with,

1988
08:47:36,229 --> 08:47:39,900
you know, as you can see. I'll put it back on the screen just so you can see just how bad

1989
08:47:39,900 --> 08:47:47,080
it was. Take a look at this right side here. Now there's a couch. Now there is a projector.

1990
08:47:47,080 --> 08:48:04,520
Two pizza ovens. Looks a lot different doesn't it? Looks much better. Yeah there's an outdoor

1991
08:48:04,520 --> 08:48:14,709
projection TV. Man but look at this backyard. Look at where we are. Fresh green. Trees. An

1992
08:48:14,709 --> 08:48:29,290
outdoor patio. A grill. A pool. A little kiddie pool. Completely redone. A fresh pond

1993
08:48:29,290 --> 08:48:35,080
with our little friends here. And our little group of flowers over there. We got a little

1994
08:48:35,080 --> 08:48:46,779
birdhouse. Small garden over here. Smoking area for those of you that smoke. Only smoke out

1995
08:48:46,779 --> 08:48:54,459
here please. And nowhere else. Letting us out to the garage area. This is the driveway.

1996
08:48:54,459 --> 08:49:11,500
Take a look at that. How do I turn the damn hut off? Another pond here. Hammock. I think

1997
08:49:11,500 --> 08:49:25,860
it looks phenomenal. Fresh driveway yeah? I'm like no I'm not crouching again. Can I go inside

1998
08:49:25,860 --> 08:50:03,880
the garage? Yeah just a second. All right in the garage we have nothing actually because

1999
08:50:03,880 --> 08:50:11,740
there was nothing built. There was something in there. Not letting the dog live inside. The

2000
08:50:11,740 --> 08:50:29,860
dog does live inside. Never mind. No what do I? No! Close this. Go back out. So let's take

2001
08:50:29,860 --> 08:50:43,180
a look inside your new home. You don't have to knock here. You own the place. Come on in.

2002
08:50:43,259 --> 08:50:55,139
This is yours. Close the door behind you so don't get too much drafty in here. Ah close that to

2003
08:50:55,139 --> 08:51:20,459
your left. Your space. Your area. Gaming lounge. You got three connections here. That seems like a

2004
08:51:20,459 --> 08:51:27,220
lot of cable. For what? Pretty believable off believable is the word that comes out of my

2005
08:51:27,220 --> 08:51:37,340
brain here. Pretty believable. Can we get a look at what it looked like inside? I don't

2006
08:51:37,340 --> 08:51:42,680
think we have that. We can get that off the screen just so you can you know we don't need

2007
08:51:42,680 --> 08:51:51,849
to see it anymore. Uh if you're wondering is this a joke? Well the no it's not. There actually are

2008
08:51:51,849 --> 08:51:57,419
toilet plumbing here. I just want to make sure I proved it to you in case you just didn't believe

2009
08:51:57,419 --> 08:52:07,580
me. Which I don't know why you wouldn't. Hold on just give me one minute. I gotta reinstall

2010
08:52:07,580 --> 08:52:15,720
the toilet here. Uh this is here for any family guy jokes that you'd like to make

2011
08:52:16,279 --> 08:52:20,439
or if you want to be at the table and use the bathroom at the same time. It's very

2012
08:52:20,439 --> 08:52:27,720
possible. Here's your kitchen area. You have uh right here this is a very interesting fridge.

2013
08:52:27,720 --> 08:52:31,799

2029
08:56:11,369 --> 08:56:27,000
I mean zero. This you can't even get this on Yelp. That's not fair. And I picked the wrong

2047
09:00:07,720 --> 09:00:10,439
Sell it now? I but I want to do the garden thing again. I feel like I picked the wrong

2048
09:00:10,439 --> 09:00:20,139
one. It's only like 10 minutes. We've been here for nine hours. What's another eight

2049
09:00:20,139 --> 09:00:37,029
minutes? So what we'll probably do is this one will take us to about 10 plus hours.

2050
09:00:37,830 --> 09:00:42,439
I'll probably just I'll probably take tomorrow off and then we'll come back on Sunday.

Technically well today is Saturday technically right so Saturday is technically now

2052
09:00:53,180 --> 09:01:10,970
so Sunday so tomorrow technically which is Sunday. Yeah or maybe I don't know maybe not.

2053
09:01:10,970 --> 09:01:18,389
Maybe. Maybe we'll just go tomorrow. It depends. Depends on what time I fall asleep

2054
09:01:18,389 --> 09:01:31,659
and get up you know. Let me see what's going on tomorrow morning. Come back in 10 minutes.

2195
09:23:35,050 --> 09:23:38,809
about the time star left an empty coffee cup in your hood I don't think I've heard it from your

2196
09:23:38,809 --> 09:23:44,360
perspective you know what I mean it's just one it wasn't that big of a deal we were at like a

2197
09:23:44,360 --> 09:23:49,480
computer store and we were walking around asking questions and he put his empty coffee

2198
09:23:49,480 --> 09:23:53,720
cup in the back of my hood I didn't know it was there so walking around talking to

2199
09:23:53,720 --> 09:24:00,580
employees of this place and finally after like it was at least like 10 to 20 straight

2200
09:24:00,580 --> 09:24:06,180
minutes or so I don't know maybe less than that of me looking like a dickhead I just have an empty

2201
09:24:06,180 --> 09:24:11,620
coffee cup in my hood and I'm like walking around oh can you show me like the i7 4770k please

2202
09:24:11,620 --> 09:24:15,940
oh yeah sure right this way sir they just I had to I walked in front of him at least a few

2203
09:24:15,940 --> 09:24:25,910
times I didn't know we put it in there so eventually I he was laughing or I don't know

2204
09:24:25,910 --> 09:24:30,550
somebody was looking somebody was looking at it or I feel it was there I knew it was there

2205
09:24:31,190 --> 09:24:34,470
and I just grabbed it we were with a bunch of like employees and a couple of managers because

2206
09:24:34,470 --> 09:24:39,669
they had to get the key to open up the thing to get like the cpu processor or whatever a

2207
09:24:39,669 --> 09:24:43,190
graphics card and I just grabbed the coffee cup and I looked at him I said you're a

2208
09:24:43,190 --> 09:24:51,720
fucking asshole and then everybody stopped and it was just like whoa and I was like no I

2209
09:24:51,720 --> 09:24:58,489

2212
09:25:25,940 --> 09:25:31,800

09:26:12,040 --> 09:26:21,660

2225
09:27:24,949 --> 09:27:29,669
italics call each other by your real names outside of the streams it's actually kind of

2226
09:27:29,669 --> 09:27:42,120
hard it's kind of hard to do to do that it's weird to explain that but I I call like for instance um

2227
09:27:43,059 --> 09:27:50,220
orb you guys know incredible orb right he was here for edc and we hung out he's the person

2228
09:27:50,220 --> 09:27:55,209
that I picked up from the airport I think did I say that or maybe I didn't uh because he's an

2229
09:27:55,209 --> 09:28:04,059
old friend we know each other for a long time but I don't I call him orb it's just orb hey

2230
09:28:04,059 --> 09:28:18,790
what's up orb I call him it's just it just that's all I've known him as my friends call

2231
09:28:18,790 --> 09:28:23,589
each other by our online names my sister and her husband too it's not weird not that weird

2232
09:28:23,589 --> 09:28:35,769
it's understand it's almost like a nickname it's a nickname that has been um it's almost like

2233
09:28:35,769 --> 09:28:39,769
you know in the game of thrones like oh you're a bastard but I could make you uh like you

2234
09:28:39,769 --> 09:28:47,370
maybe in the world of like a song of ice and fire right a king can make somebody well

2235
09:28:47,769 --> 09:28:57,449
you're no longer like this person I'm going to name you you can be like named back in like the old

2236
09:28:57,449 --> 09:29:05,400
like 1400s you could be like named to have like your actual name instead of just be you know the

2237
09:29:05,400 --> 09:29:10,339
your online id this is a really bad analogy I think I'm too tired to explain this because

2238
09:29:10,339 --> 09:29:13,540
I here's what happened I'll tell you exactly what just happened right there so I was just

2239
09:29:13,540 --> 09:29:17,050
talking about I didn't want to like go off in a game of thrones because I was terrified that

2240
09:29:17,050 --> 09:29:20,410
I didn't want to like have anybody say anything because I mean the show just ended so I

2241
09:29:20,410 --> 09:29:24,730
started to talk about like a real a really good analogy but like I didn't want to talk about the

2242
09:29:24,730 --> 09:29:30,120
show so then I was like I was like so I have a bit of an evil so I don't want to talk about

2243
09:29:30,120 --> 09:29:42,839
that and then I kind of gave up 1400s is medieval times so I didn't want to like

2244
09:29:42,839 --> 09:29:46,680
have people talk about like oh game of thrones let's talk about that you know what I'm saying

2245
09:29:50,180 --> 09:29:55,379
long story short uh it's not like that weird I don't think to call somebody people come

2246
09:29:55,379 --> 09:29:59,699
in germa all the time even like personal friends of mine but even before being online

2247
09:30:00,980 --> 09:30:13,180
germa germa hey what's up germ like my father my like parents call me that hey germ so I mean it's

2248
09:30:13,180 --> 09:30:30,010
not out of the ordinary thing I don't think yeah it's just a nickname the infection is spreading

2249
09:30:30,010 --> 09:30:35,559
all right we only got a couple more we got uh cad btv for the 250 I can't wait for the
