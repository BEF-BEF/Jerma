1
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:07,620
I'm enjoying rap. Yeah, I didn't have time to make a title, guys. I just found out eight

2
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:18,210
minutes ago that I can't play Tony Hawk right now. That is a quick, very fast title. I just

3
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:31,070
found out I can't play Tony Hawk until I get an original Xbox hard drive. Imagine my face

4
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:40,630
when it's 1.47 p.m. Oh, sorry, 12.47 p.m. Pacific. And I put in Tony Hawk's Underground. Oh,

5
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:50,149
it's backwards. It's backwards compatible. Close. Here it comes. You need an Xbox, an

6
00:00:50,149 --> 00:01:00,140
original Xbox hard drive to play this game. That's like a bite my finger. Okay. Now what

7
00:01:00,579 --> 00:01:07,299
do I do? Because I don't have one of those. I don't own one of those. So I have to get some

8
00:01:07,299 --> 00:01:16,040
third party. But I'm not going to put that on here. How do you attach an original Xbox hard

9
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:27,819
drive to an Xbox 360? I don't understand. It's a 360 hard drive. That's not what it said. It said

10
00:01:27,819 --> 00:01:41,829
I need an original Xbox hard drive. Play it on PC. It's probably very hard to get that game to run

11
00:01:41,829 --> 00:01:49,579
on PC. I'm scared to buy it on and try to get it on PC because it probably doesn't work. The 360

12
00:01:49,579 --> 00:01:57,310
hard drive can do. But this doesn't have a hard drive in it. Whatever. All right. I'll figure that

13
00:01:57,310 --> 00:02:07,219
out over the next couple of days. I want to play Tony Hawk too. Buy it on PC. I gotta find it too.

14
00:02:07,219 --> 00:02:14,539
All right. So we're doing a pivot here. We're doing a hard pivot. And this is a game that I

15
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:18,979
have that I bought that I know I was going to play it eventually and knew during an Xbox stream.

16
00:02:18,979 --> 00:02:30,259
This was very, very highly requested. This is Asura's wrath. I heard it's crazy. So I'm like,

17
00:02:30,259 --> 00:02:41,740
all right, I'll get it. The arcade slim 360 doesn't have one. Holy shit. This shit is nuts.

18
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:49,460
All right. Yeah, let's go. This is a hard pivot and I got plenty of hard pivots. This game fucking

19
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:56,500
sucks compared to Tony Hawk. But don't worry. I have it behind me. I just need like an Xbox

20
00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:06,819
hard drive. I didn't know that. I wasn't personally contacted by Phil. Let me tweet this out. We'll

21
00:03:06,819 --> 00:03:55,960
start in a minute. I'll be back in like two minutes. All right. What is this? What is this

22
00:03:55,960 --> 00:04:04,060
game? Not even an HD? What? Are you serious? Look at this game. Look at this. What is this game? Not

23
00:04:04,939 --> 00:04:18,259
That's some crazy music going on in the background here. Look at this. Quick apologize. I don't have

24
00:04:18,259 --> 00:04:23,829
to apologize for anything. There are no, I, I'm going to, I'm going to seem to make a statement

25
00:04:23,829 --> 00:04:32,149
here. I am not going to apologize once on this screen. Okay. I don't need to apologize for

26
00:04:32,149 --> 00:04:36,790
anything. I actually saw somebody talk about this recently. They said he doesn't have to fucking

27
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:42,459
apologize. He'd do whatever he wants. And I was like, thank you. Thank you for saying that. I

28
00:04:42,459 --> 00:04:49,829
do whatever I want. That being said, I'm very sorry if you happen to find something in this

29
00:04:49,829 --> 00:05:01,379
game that you know, just kidding. The sir is rat. Here we go. Can we just play on fucking David?

30
00:05:02,019 --> 00:05:16,899
Does it really matter? No, I need to be able to like, no, I'm going on my shitty account. Oh, come

31
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:39,670
on. Let me just, a 620 fucking K update. What is it? Did you change a background image there?

32
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:51,480
What do you even possibly update with a 600 K update? That this text was changed. Get it together.

33
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:55,720
By the way, this is from Capcom. One of the best fucking video game companies currently right now.

34
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:07,209
They're really killing it. It's an HD now. Ooh, that'd be cool if it was. All right. Cool. Is it

35
00:06:07,209 --> 00:06:23,750
an HD? Wait, does it? Is it an HD now? Why does it look different? A new episode has arrived. Lost

36
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:36,009
episode two. The new episode has arrived. Lost episode one. The show lost. All right.

37
00:06:38,139 --> 00:06:43,540
Oh, why only the first two episodes? I don't understand. JJ Abrams. A new episode has arrived.

38
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:53,449
Episode pack part four. A new episode has arrived. Episode 11.5. A new episode of TV has arrived.

39
00:06:53,449 --> 00:07:05,350
Episode 15.5. There's a lot of random TV shows. I just opened up a sir's wrath's torrent folder.

40
00:07:05,829 --> 00:07:22,279
New game. It's like the difficulty. All right. This is a hard game. Players who want to enjoy

41
00:07:22,279 --> 00:07:27,160
the story. Players who want to seek revenge on those who betrayed them. Players who want to

42
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:34,939
unleash their wrath. Hard. No, no. Be real. Be real. This is like, this game's like 10 years old.

43
00:07:34,939 --> 00:07:46,569
Is hard too hard? Do it. Is it too hard? Normal please. All right. Hold on. Is VR Josh here right

44
00:07:46,569 --> 00:07:50,089
now? Because VR Josh was one of the people that recommended this game. VR Josh, are you here?

45
00:07:50,970 --> 00:08:04,389
Help me. I need to know. I trust you. I only saw cutscenes. What? What do you mean you only saw

46
00:08:04,389 --> 00:08:11,480
cutscenes? You've, this is like a direct recommendation. You only, what, you watched

47
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:20,180
the cutscene on YouTube? The cutscene movie? You never even played the game? I hope this wasn't a

48
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:39,240
fucking mistake. This game is almost entirely cutscenes. Is it? The ending of this game is

49
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:49,450
locked behind DLC. Oh, great. Paramount pictures? What? Oh, what? I thought that was spelling

50
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:51,850
paramount. I was like, holy shit, that's kind of cool.

51
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:32,789
Developed by Capcom. Pretty good extensive use of the Unreal Engine 3 lighting effects.

52
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:47,620
I like that bright yellow light is in every game and from 2012 to like 2016. Wait, didn't I already

53
00:09:47,620 --> 00:10:02,809
press start? I already pressed start. What? Okay. Press start again. Oh shit. Lock on fire.

54
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:13,289
What am I firing at? Is this like Star Fox?

55
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:33,419
What the fuck is that? What is going on? Did I kill it? I would like it if there was not text all of

56
00:10:33,419 --> 00:10:56,230
the screen. Whoa. Rapid fire X. Am I dead? It's cinematic. Oh. All right, for a second I didn't

57
00:10:56,230 --> 00:11:02,149
know what those buttons were. I was like, what is GS? It was right stick. I was fucked it up.

58
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:18,440
Is your Xbox running in 1080? It's rough on the eyes. Yeah. Yeah, it is. This game,

59
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:22,200
what's on the back of the box? Does this game even have 1080p as an option?

60
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:45,529
A 720p 1080i 1080p. It should be. No, it's not. Hold on. How do I check? Check your Xbox settings.

61
00:11:46,169 --> 00:11:57,429
Settings. Preferences. What's it under? Preferences. System settings.

62
00:11:58,149 --> 00:12:01,590
As you'll end your current session. Let me get to like a save point first. Sorry. No, no, no.

63
00:12:02,309 --> 00:12:19,620
It's fine. I think it just looks like this, guys. No, it's definitely 1080. Because it wouldn't be

64
00:12:20,419 --> 00:12:24,980
fucked up looking on my other screen. This is 1080. Guys, this is 2012 1080.

65
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:47,350
It's beat. Brightness on 200%. You know what? You know what? It might be. Let's check. All right,

66
00:12:47,350 --> 00:13:11,509
coming to the QT. Is that better? It's better, right? Yeah, that's better. All right. Yeah,

67
00:13:11,509 --> 00:13:17,100
the brightness was up for some reason. Good job catching that. I wouldn't have thought that.

68
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:22,809
Hold on. I got to go back.

69
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:30,230
I'm back.

70
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:39,190
The impure have defiled and scorched our land, but it is we who shall live to see tomorrow's light.

71
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:48,389
Legion of demigods, heed your priestess's words and purify your lamps and for all.

72
00:13:49,269 --> 00:13:53,590
That sounds like one of the dragons in Warcraft. Let us offer Gaia the greatest blessing.

73
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:56,950
I'm sorry. Let me rephrase that. Any dragon in Warcraft.

74
00:14:08,679 --> 00:14:13,000
This is actually kind of cool. Big, cool enemies. When do I get to play the game?

75
00:14:15,159 --> 00:14:25,179
Oh, look at that. I want to be that demigod. This is the game. No, it's not. This is not the game.

76
00:14:25,179 --> 00:14:32,379
This is like the first little tutorial cinematic part of the game. This is not the full game.

77
00:14:33,259 --> 00:14:48,970
I remember the health bar. This is not the game. It's the opening cut scene.

78
00:15:00,279 --> 00:15:05,799
What do you mean he seriously doesn't know? This is not the game. This is the opening cut scene.

79
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:47,049
That was a pretty sick Derva Raptor. That was the exact noise. Let's go. You're halfway done with

80
00:15:47,210 --> 00:16:13,190
the game. The whole game is just an E3 demo. No, the eight guardian generals.

81
00:16:25,899 --> 00:16:30,460
There he is. The eight guardian generals. Asura.

82
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:56,409
I know this is not the actual game because games aren't hard. This is not hard. This is

83
00:16:56,570 --> 00:17:01,049
not a game at all, actually. So how could it be hard?

84
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:40,420
The game won't register how fast I can do it. Sorry, guys. What is going on?

85
00:17:46,859 --> 00:17:49,990
Apologize.

86
00:17:49,990 --> 00:18:03,750
Nice. Oh, nice. You're at level two. Nice. Level two. Here I come.

87
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:17,210
Go.

88
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:33,509
Why are we just all sitting in a Google Hangout? Don't we have Earth to save? I don't understand.

89
00:18:33,509 --> 00:18:50,980
Okay, there's supposed to be eight generals. I think that's like 12.

90
00:19:01,319 --> 00:19:07,880
The music's too loud. I can't even hear what he's saying.

91
00:19:12,009 --> 00:19:27,500
They made the music too loud. Remember, you just triggered my Google Home.

92
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:35,400
Get your Google Home away from the speakers of your computer.

93
00:19:36,359 --> 00:19:45,880
Can you hear that sometimes? Dude, what the fuck? Alexa just started responding to me.

94
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:54,900
Is Alexa in your headset? No, put Alexa in your fucking living room and turn the volume down.

95
00:19:55,779 --> 00:19:58,819
Not in your office. No, office in quotes.

96
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:16,089
It shows how serious we are about winning.

97
00:20:19,529 --> 00:20:28,299
This game looks fucking dumb. Okay, this game was $60 when it came out. I have no idea how much it

98
00:20:28,299 --> 00:20:36,700
is now. I really don't know how much this was. It might still be $60. I have no idea. All right,

99
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:46,599
we made it to the impurity level. Holy shit, wait, did the Earth just turn into a monster?

100
00:20:47,559 --> 00:21:06,900
Well, we were not prepared for this. Okay, we're getting a commercial break.

101
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:23,210
Yes, this is actually the anime has the commercial break. All we needed right there was a voiceover.

102
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:36,890
Here we go. Am I going to float around and shoot things out of my eyes or whatever it is?

103
00:21:37,609 --> 00:21:39,769
Oh, metal. Full metal alchemist.

104
00:21:43,819 --> 00:21:48,539
The worst part about those is it says it twice. You don't need to say it on the return,

105
00:21:49,259 --> 00:21:57,500
especially when you're watching a repeat of it for a DVD or on Netflix, whatever. And it goes

106
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:02,779
full metal alchemist, full metal alchemist. It's like you don't just cut that second one out.

107
00:22:02,779 --> 00:22:18,230
Like where's the quality control? This is the longest opening ever.

108
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:25,880
What's your business?

109
00:22:29,210 --> 00:22:36,309
Are there levels? This is a third person action game? I think, no, it is, right? How long is this

110
00:22:36,309 --> 00:23:09,799
game? Wait, wait, wait. No, this is not it. This is like a third person Bayonetta kind of game,

111
00:23:09,799 --> 00:23:27,380
right? Like devil may cry. Yeah. No, he really believes that. No, I do.

112
00:23:35,259 --> 00:23:44,099
No, this is. Oh shit. In 16 years of playing games, I've never seen anything like Asura's

113
00:23:44,099 --> 00:23:56,230
wrath is the quote from IGN. That doesn't mean good. That doesn't say this is very fun to play.

114
00:24:01,019 --> 00:24:08,950
It means it means it's it's different dot dot dot dot. Interesting. It's interesting.

115
00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:16,279
And all the stuff in the back of the box. Yeah, there's no, I don't know what I did.

116
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,259
I'm going to give it a chance. No, I'm not going to. This is what we're doing.

117
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:48,019
16 years of playing games. What? Am I dead? All right. You can take that quote in 16 years

118
00:24:48,019 --> 00:24:53,140
of playing games. I've never seen anything like this. It was so bad. It's the worst game I played

119
00:24:53,140 --> 00:25:05,529
in 16 years. That quote could be like, in all my years, I've never seen anything so bad.

120
00:25:33,829 --> 00:25:35,269
This game is good. I know it is.

121
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:21,049
What troubles you? Wait, Asura is a street fighter character.

122
00:26:21,049 --> 00:26:29,930
I could not kill it. No one can kill Vlytra. You should be grateful you were able to subdue it.

123
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:38,710
We have suffered more casualties than ever, but it will not be back for a while.

124
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:46,890
You should rest. Asura. Due to General Asura's efforts, Vlytra has subsided.

125
00:26:50,099 --> 00:26:54,420
No, he's Asura's in-street fighter. Confused.

126
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:10,660
The costume.

127
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:30,420
Soon you will get to play a video game. Episode one.

128
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:52,940
I got an A. I'm good. New concept art has been added. War of creation.

129
00:27:53,740 --> 00:28:08,039
A new video has been added. Episode one. All right. All right. Let's go.

130
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:18,519
Episode one of Germacraft has been unlocked. Episode one. Coming of a new dream.

131
00:28:19,319 --> 00:28:26,339
Short interludes in between the episodes are displayed to further explain the story.

132
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:37,930
All right. Let's go. Congratulations, Commander. We have once again succeeded in suppressing.

133
00:28:39,349 --> 00:28:42,630
That means nothing, and time will be back and pose an even greater threat than today.

134
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:46,869
That vile beast destroying will be more troublesome than I had anticipated, and

135
00:28:46,869 --> 00:28:49,349
who would have thought that Helion Asura would be the one to quell-

136
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:53,589
That was only possible because we have a comic book in- all right, so the first part of the

137
00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:59,299
game was an interactive movie, and now the second part of the game here is a comic book.

138
00:29:00,019 --> 00:29:11,339
The third part of the game will be playing a video game. It was only possible because

139
00:29:11,339 --> 00:29:20,950
they had aid of the priestess. Okay. Yes, his daughter Mithra. We might very well owe our

140
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:25,349
victory solely to her. The priestess proves to be more useful than Emperor Strata himself.

141
00:29:26,309 --> 00:29:33,349
Okay, perhaps I said too much. No. Well, yes. Yes, you have. Just a little bit.

142
00:29:34,779 --> 00:29:39,420
Okay. All right. Can I have like an earpiece while I fight that, like, you can tell me the

143
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:43,819
rest in my earpiece? Hmm, arcing the power. Her power will be a vital step in acknowledging our-

144
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:48,619
Indeed, her ability to amplify mantra is quite remarkable. You would never guess that mindless

145
00:29:48,619 --> 00:29:53,099
brute to be her father. I suggest we intervene for the priestess's sake. He is a potential

146
00:29:53,099 --> 00:29:58,779
danger to our plans. Not just yet, he can still be useful to us. Haven't had any new info from

147
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:12,420
For now, we must concentrate on completing the karma fortress as well as finding more efficient.

148
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:17,380
Give it a chance. Hold on. Just give it a chance. This game's only like four and a half hours long.

149
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:23,180
Just give it a moment. Just wait a minute. Without that, first assured commander, I have

150
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:28,710
already devised a plan for it all, including the priestess. Just skip the filler episodes.

151
00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:35,589
This is not- Okay, episode one is not a filler episode. If episode one is a filler episode of

152
00:30:35,589 --> 00:30:42,779
your TV show, holy fuck, you did it wrong. Very well. Perceive his plan. Failure is not an option.

153
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:51,240
Priestess Mithra lent her power to the Shinkoku army and all of Gaia rejoiced at the victory over

154
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:57,480
Vlytra. But this time- What happened in episode one? For in the shadows of victory, the wheels of

155
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:02,680
betrayal had already been set in motion. One that would shake the very foundation- Is this a preview?

156
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:08,549
Did this game come out? No, it didn't. It's the- I didn't skip anything.

157
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:21,960
Go to the next episode. It was an episode one recap? Skip the previews. It's going to spoil things, okay?

158
00:31:23,779 --> 00:31:37,259
The day after the defeat of V- whatever. How do I get QTEs to walk and like,

159
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:46,150
shake hands and wave and shit? See, no one's ever went full fucking absolute QTE. I want a QTE where

160
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:50,069
every button is me. I have to press A every time I take a step. Like, I have to do QTEs right now.

161
00:31:50,710 --> 00:32:01,220
And if I fail, I have to start the whole thing over. Asura! Oh, that's- that's- that's wife.

162
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:15,500
Father! All right, easy. It's like tripped three times. You're safe. I am.

163
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:32,539
She failed the QTE. Asura, the emperor summons you. He awaits your presence in the throne room.

164
00:32:32,539 --> 00:32:38,259
I wonder if he's going to present you with a medal for defeating Vlytra. She's right. You

165
00:32:38,259 --> 00:32:50,819
mustn't keep the emperor waiting. All right. This is like an android or something?

166
00:32:51,619 --> 00:32:58,019
These fucking frames. It's 2012 1080p, don't you know? They cared so much about having a huge

167
00:32:58,019 --> 00:33:04,390
resolution. Games- the Xbox 360 couldn't run this shit at like more than 20 frames a second,

168
00:33:04,390 --> 00:33:13,289
but it was like 1080p. Having a game at 720 or like 480 was like, no, no, no, no, no, no,

169
00:33:13,289 --> 00:33:26,779
excuse me. Don't do that. Ugly. Oh shit, it said press A. I pressed B. Oh fuck. These are hard.

170
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:48,380
What'd you do? Everybody's failing QTEs.

171
00:33:58,599 --> 00:34:03,079
Uh, all right, so they think I did it. It's the- it's the classic I didn't do it,

172
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:11,000
but I have- I have blood all over my hands, so it has to be me. That's classic.

173
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:34,179
Understand what's happening. Still, part one. What episode is this? Wait, episode two,

174
00:34:34,179 --> 00:34:38,980
part one. Episode two, betrayal and vengeance of part one of episode two.

175
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:50,570
It wasn't me. Why do you have to have anything named after me? Episode two, part one of episode two.

176
00:34:50,570 --> 00:35:03,750
Episode two, part one of episode three. Here we go. Gameplay. Press B attack.

177
00:35:07,110 --> 00:35:24,139
That was pretty fun. Just do heavy attack. It's easy.

178
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:38,219
The FPS. Yeah, don't you know? In stunning 1080p. Graphics absolutely stunning.

179
00:35:38,940 --> 00:36:22,659
Basura's wrath. Basura's wrath. I think the rule- the moral of the story here is don't ever,

180
00:36:22,659 --> 00:36:28,119
like, touch anyone. That's- you know what I mean? Like, what- what are they- what are they- what are

181
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:36,260
they dead? Do they have your blood on your hands? She just came up behind and, like, put her hand on

182
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:39,780
her back. What if she was dead and you had blood all over your hands? Don't fucking ever. Always

183
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:58,900
make sure the person's alive first. That is- kill this guy? Oh, that's kind of cool. Oh, well, I

184
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:16,760
thought- I thought A was dead. Do I have a health bar? Can you die in this game? Oh, perfect. Perfect

185
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:35,449
QTE. I won. Dude, he got one. That's one of the eight. You know what the best part about

186
00:37:35,449 --> 00:37:43,159
full sprint close-up run is in any form of video? Your- the suspension of disbelief is if they cut

187
00:37:43,159 --> 00:37:50,170
to, like, he- he's, like, in another country, it's like, oh, okay, that makes sense. Oh, don't touch

188
00:37:50,730 --> 00:37:56,619
her! Don't go- don't- no, no, no, get away! No, no, you idiot! Didn't you just learn anything?

189
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:26,250
You! Who did this? Oh, shit, it wasn't me! This- I swear! Have you learned nothing? QTE her back to

190
00:38:26,250 --> 00:39:01,059
life. I don't think that's how this works. Who's that? Hold on. Isn't this, like, the exact story

191
00:39:01,059 --> 00:39:09,369
of God of War? The exact story. Didn't this- didn't this happen in God of War? Kind of.

192
00:39:09,849 --> 00:39:37,460
Awesome. Yes, play that. But wha- why are you in there? You can't see with that on. Why would you

193
00:39:37,460 --> 00:40:00,980
put that on? Yeah, necessary for civilization. Uh, not that concerned about the guy that can't see

194
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:06,179
right now. I can't see anything. I could throw a rock at that guy's head and it would probably

195
00:40:06,179 --> 00:40:25,289
knock him out and I could beat that guy. Not even eye holes. I don't know why I'm thinking-

196
00:40:25,289 --> 00:40:31,349
I'm looking way too much into that one. But really, that's just a big piece of metal covering your

197
00:40:31,349 --> 00:41:21,900
eyes. I didn't fail with my QTE. I'm going over the edge. Next Smash Brothers character?

198
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:34,630
Oh, he's already in season three fighter. He's getting zapped back to level one.

199
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:46,179
What? Can't I fly? Wasn't I just flying? Just fly. You know how to fly.

200
00:41:48,340 --> 00:42:09,260
I know how to fly. Well, all right, well, she's got turned into an N64 character.

201
00:42:10,619 --> 00:42:23,159
You've just degraded her graphics quality. Uh-oh, that's not good. I kind of turned her into a cake.

202
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:29,929
She just turned into a cake. All right, to be continued.

203
00:42:38,199 --> 00:42:41,159
Did I even have to do anything? Oh, I had to fight a little bit. Yeah.

204
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:45,880
Look, I got S. This one's hard too. Imagine playing this one. Easy.

205
00:42:50,250 --> 00:42:57,940
A new video has been added so you can just watch them. All right, let's go.

206
00:43:02,329 --> 00:43:07,050
You're gonna end up with zero viewers. No, I'm not. Relax.

207
00:43:07,050 --> 00:43:18,550
So this is like fake about me.

208
00:43:37,019 --> 00:43:40,059
Yes, this is like fake. This has been made up about me, right?

209
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:46,619
Yeah, like they scapegoated me, right?

210
00:44:23,909 --> 00:44:28,710
Under the command of the great deus, they fought heroically against their brother who betrayed them

211
00:44:28,710 --> 00:44:35,190
and avenged their emperor's death by sending Asura to his own. Henceforth, they became known as the

212
00:44:35,190 --> 00:44:41,719
seven deities and they watch over the humans from the heavens, but they don't have a great marketing

213
00:44:41,719 --> 00:44:50,760
team because pretty boring. We were the eight, now we're the seven. That's it. This is minus one.

214
00:44:54,840 --> 00:45:00,599
All he has left is his wrath. Refusing to die, Asura awakens in a strange world.

215
00:45:00,599 --> 00:45:05,159
Oh, it's Asura. There, a small mysterious spider. All right, all right. You skip, skip. Yeah,

216
00:45:05,159 --> 00:45:07,960
we're watching the preview for the next episode, right? I don't know. I didn't... All right,

217
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:19,380
whatever. Does it really matter? Doesn't matter. Oh my god, there was a spider there. You know what

218
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:43,099
that means. Don't skip Dan's game. We're still getting opening cutscenes credits. Oh, thank god

219
00:45:43,099 --> 00:45:53,139
he grabbed onto that edge. How long are you even doing that for? Episode three, hell on Nogaya.

220
00:46:20,869 --> 00:46:23,829
The golden, the golden friendly spider.

221
00:46:27,750 --> 00:46:31,940
I hope you guys just started to like the game.

222
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:48,840
Five thousand bits just came in from phylactery. Five thousand bits. Fifty dollars. Please play

223
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:56,019
this whole game. The boss fights are a huge, such a huge spectacle to see. I mean, we're here, so

224
00:46:56,820 --> 00:47:05,030
I didn't fail this. You can't fail this. What if I press down? I cannot fail that.

225
00:47:06,789 --> 00:47:14,650
Up you go. Yes, there is a reason why you must continue to climb. But thanks for the

226
00:47:14,650 --> 00:47:20,059
50 dollars phylactery. We're here. I got no other plan. Man, I was gonna play Tony Hawk, but I need

227
00:47:20,059 --> 00:47:25,340
a fucking hard drive, but I didn't know that because I'm stupid. That's it. Keep going. I'm

228
00:47:25,340 --> 00:47:29,019
not even that stupid. I'm actually pretty smart. I'm pretty... I would say I'm like average

229
00:47:29,019 --> 00:47:32,940
intelligence. I am. I am. We make jokes on this channel, but I'm... I know what I'm doing.

230
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:49,050
These are our enemies. Tutorial. The impure goma. Let's see what you make of them. Wait, isn't this

231
00:47:49,050 --> 00:47:57,769
one of the seven? I already... I already know how to do this. This is tutorial two. This is tutorial

232
00:47:57,769 --> 00:48:10,739
two, part two, episode two, part one. Every heavy attack causes Asura to overheat for a period of

233
00:48:10,739 --> 00:48:22,500
time. Heavy attacks cannot be used while overheating. This is cool. This game is so hype. I love it.

234
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:28,980
Yeah, I see everyone is relaxed. That's because the first hour of the game is a TV show.

235
00:48:34,329 --> 00:48:41,719
But while you're overheating, you can't... Yeah, you can't. Hold B to perform a dash attack.

236
00:48:43,719 --> 00:48:46,679
Dude, this is just like DMC, man. This is just like DMC.

237
00:48:47,639 --> 00:49:10,380
Wow, I love this game. It's just like fucking DMC 2. After pressing A, hold B to... DMC 2 was the shitty

238
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:17,719
one. Oh, sorry. I have not played one second of any of the Devil May Cry games. Not one second.

239
00:49:18,519 --> 00:49:24,340
Press Y to execute a special attack when your enemy is down. Especially... Yeah, I know how to do that.

240
00:49:28,389 --> 00:49:36,809
Good. I thought people loved those games. What are you talking about? You're a fake Capcom fan.

241
00:49:37,690 --> 00:49:55,909
I never claimed to be a real Capcom fan. What? People love them all except DMC 2.

242
00:49:56,710 --> 00:50:01,159
No. No, you're telling me I picked the one that... the one that everybody hates?

243
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:17,269
Uh-oh. Big boy. Asura can recover directly after being hit by pressing A. Recovering reduces damage

244
00:50:17,269 --> 00:50:21,909
and allows Asura to quickly get back into a fighting stance. So I get knocked down

245
00:50:22,789 --> 00:50:30,389
after immediately after getting hit. They have to hit the ground first. So... Oh, we missed. Come on.

246
00:50:31,590 --> 00:50:49,500
Let's go. Oh, finally an evade. Now this is my game. Oh, yeah. Dodge roll.

247
00:50:52,460 --> 00:50:57,820
Like, there's no way I lose now. You guys know me in a dodge roll. It's... I'm so good with a dodge

248
00:50:57,900 --> 00:51:02,780
roll. Four buttons. Dodge roll. I will not have a single problem in this game.

249
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:08,550
Press the correct on-screen prompt right before an enemy attacks to execute a counter-attack.

250
00:51:10,460 --> 00:51:25,099
Dodge roll, baby. Yup. Again? Here again. This game is the equivalent of somebody saying,

251
00:51:25,099 --> 00:51:28,619
trust me, this show is good. You just have to get past three episodes.

252
00:51:30,889 --> 00:51:42,889
Yeah, kind of. And then by the time you get to pass the third episode and you're on the

253
00:51:43,449 --> 00:51:47,530
couch and they look over at you and they can tell that you're not into it, they know that they've

254
00:51:47,530 --> 00:51:51,929
failed. And they're just sitting there going, god damn it, they're not into this at all. And

255
00:51:51,929 --> 00:51:57,769
they should be at this point and they're not. So I'm just gonna give them an out. And you give

256
00:51:57,769 --> 00:52:02,809
them an out simply by saying something like this. All right, that's three episodes in. I mean,

257
00:52:02,809 --> 00:52:08,730
that's a lot of TV. Yeah, it's a pretty cool show. We can do something else. I'm gonna take the DVD

258
00:52:08,730 --> 00:52:15,769
out. I'll take it out. And then they either go, yeah, yeah, that's a lot of TV. Three episodes

259
00:52:15,769 --> 00:52:18,650
before. That's a lot of TV. You're right. That's pretty cool, though. That's when you know,

260
00:52:18,650 --> 00:52:22,010
take the fucking DVD out and do something else. They don't want to watch the show and they never

261
00:52:22,010 --> 00:52:37,800
will. Hold X for rapid fire. Oh, I actually have to aim this thing. Why can't I just do that

262
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:47,050
normally? Why would I ever punch with my fist? And then you never watch it or bring it up ever

263
00:52:47,050 --> 00:52:55,619
again. And then you feel terrible because you love this show. And you're like, fuck, man, I just

264
00:52:55,619 --> 00:53:01,460
watched three episodes of this show. I'm gonna keep going. And then you get like 25 episodes in

265
00:53:01,460 --> 00:53:09,210
because this is like the fourth time you've watched the show. And they might come up to you at some

266
00:53:09,210 --> 00:53:12,250
point in the future and be like, hey, dude, you want to watch like episode four? And you're like,

267
00:53:12,250 --> 00:53:17,750
fuck, I don't want to watch the show again from the beginning again. We had a chance and now I

268
00:53:17,750 --> 00:53:23,980
already went like two seasons ahead of this. Now I have to watch it again. I know. I've been there

269
00:53:23,980 --> 00:53:41,130
before. Trust me, guys. You can use rapid fire to shoot it in analog aiming. Why is he teaching me

270
00:53:41,130 --> 00:53:56,360
this? I didn't start. I haven't stopped. What is he shooting from? Spines on his back. That's what I

271
00:53:56,360 --> 00:54:07,820
gather from this. This is a flashback. You idiot. Sorry. Sorry. I wasn't aware we were in episode

272
00:54:07,820 --> 00:54:23,289
three part one of the second part of the second tutorial. Apologizing. You already said that joke.

273
00:54:23,289 --> 00:54:28,760
I'm gonna say it again because it's very relevant right now. Don't apologize. I'm not apologizing.

274
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:35,110
No, I'm not sorry. All right. Inflicting and receiving damage increases the unlimited gauge.

275
00:54:35,110 --> 00:54:41,429
Once it's full unlimited mode can be activated by pressing LT. Automatically activated in easy mode.

276
00:54:41,429 --> 00:55:08,070
Okay. Fill up the unlimited gauge by attacking. Where am I? I wish there was a block.

277
00:55:08,630 --> 00:55:21,750
Oh, why can I not lock on? Isn't LB lock on? How do you fill it if it's unlimited?

278
00:55:23,190 --> 00:55:36,019
I don't know. Your guess is as good as mine. That's a lot of bar to fill up.

279
00:55:36,980 --> 00:55:49,530
That's full. Now use it by left trigger. In unlimited mode, Asura's strength is increased

280
00:55:49,530 --> 00:56:06,199
and he cannot overheat. But I just can keep. Inflicting damage upon enemies increases the burst

281
00:56:06,199 --> 00:56:11,159
gauge. Once it's full, burst can be activated by pressing RT and unleashing a devastating attack.

282
00:56:11,159 --> 00:56:30,980
Okay. I have two gauges. Higher DPS. Do you level up in this game? No wonder. I'm gonna try this.

283
00:56:30,980 --> 00:56:45,909
There you go. Why the exact moment of impact increases your

284
00:56:45,909 --> 00:56:50,150
synchronic rate with Asura? Do you have a high enough synchronic rate and get?

285
00:56:55,880 --> 00:57:29,300
What? Get what? That's a cool sword. Is that a machine gun? That was like distant machine gun fire.

286
00:57:29,300 --> 00:57:29,780
What was that?

287
00:57:50,579 --> 00:57:58,010
This spider is probably worth a lot of money. I mean that is coming in jewels and shit.

288
00:58:04,900 --> 00:58:07,699
Solid gold spider covered in sapphires.

289
00:58:13,059 --> 00:58:20,380
Where are we now? Where am I? Where am I?

290
00:58:20,380 --> 00:58:48,659
All right. All right. I get it. Not bad. It's pretty fucking fun. Yeah, it's pretty fucking

291
00:58:48,659 --> 00:58:56,409
fun. I imagine that that I'm saying that while I have a crying face. It's pretty fun guys.

292
00:59:09,300 --> 00:59:16,760
Play Hulk Ultimate Destruction Resonance Leaper. Well, I recommend it then. You can't just come to

293
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:22,199
the screen and be like, hey dude, why is this called Hulk Ultimate Destruction for the fucking

294
00:59:22,199 --> 00:59:41,800
weed? I don't have that game. Let's go. That guy has a point. I don't have that game. Should

295
00:59:41,800 --> 01:00:03,019
I get it? Is that game fun? The ultimate in Unreal 3 lighting.

296
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:16,280
You know, I could do this with the OBS sliders. In fact, I feel like I've done it already.

297
01:00:21,130 --> 01:00:45,559
Do it. Unregistered Hypercam. No, it will be unregistered weed. I don't know why and I'm

298
01:00:45,559 --> 01:00:49,480
going to probably make a lot of people angry with this, but I feel like that's how Twilight

299
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:54,019
Princess looks the whole time. Did I just make anybody angry? I may have.

300
01:00:58,380 --> 01:01:09,780
It's not a bad game. I'm still angry though.

301
01:01:36,489 --> 01:01:40,409
It's at this point where I go, all right, listen, buddy. You tell me exactly what's going on or I'm

302
01:01:40,409 --> 01:01:45,139
breaking a leg off and making a million. I mean, I'm just going to stop. I'm taking a fall. I'm

303
01:01:45,139 --> 01:02:02,869
taking a leg. Tell me what's going on. The next time you talk in a riddle, I'm

304
01:02:02,869 --> 01:02:36,170
melting you down into a necklace. It'll be that easy. He's very angry. Did you get the DLC for

305
01:02:36,170 --> 01:02:41,860
this? No. I did not.

306
01:02:53,860 --> 01:03:08,090
I can't get the ending without it. Who's this? How you save the world? This place looks like hell.

307
01:03:13,610 --> 01:03:24,199
This is you after Simpsons hit and run. How many episodes are there in the, I almost said show and

308
01:03:24,199 --> 01:03:27,800
I would have been right, but how many episodes are in there? Part one, episode three. How many

309
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:46,820
parts and how many episodes? 13 episodes? 15 parts? All right. I was told skip the next part

310
01:03:46,820 --> 01:04:00,940
because I don't, we don't want spoilers. It's 12 parts total, seven episodes. 12 parts in seven,

311
01:04:01,659 --> 01:04:13,420
two episodes per part? A barren land somewhere on Gaia, the golden spider. What do you think?

312
01:04:13,420 --> 01:04:18,539
It's become a tad desolate since you were here last. I can hear thunder in the distance. Can

313
01:04:18,539 --> 01:04:25,579
you see the lightning? It is as red as blood. So you remember, yes, the threat of the Goma still

314
01:04:25,579 --> 01:04:30,619
remains even now. Curious as to what your former comrades have been doing. Over there, have a look.

315
01:04:31,659 --> 01:04:42,889
They looked at Goma. Not quite. This was the work of your own race, the demigods.

316
01:04:43,610 --> 01:04:48,650
What? They now have control over the world as they do please as much as they want to.

317
01:04:48,650 --> 01:05:02,380
Paraphrasing, actors do that. Changing the few words around. That can't be. A lot can change

318
01:05:02,380 --> 01:05:07,500
in 12,000 years. If you don't believe me, why don't you go see for yourself? Shut up.

319
01:05:08,219 --> 01:05:13,269
There's that famous Asura anger. Well then, this world shall be your playground.

320
01:05:14,739 --> 01:05:18,900
After a long slumber, Asura. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. No, there's a bell in this one.

321
01:05:18,900 --> 01:05:23,929
Fuck. I'm done. Somebody hits a bell and shit and it's probably very important.

322
01:05:25,190 --> 01:05:36,889
All right, next episode. Bell spoiled. I'm so fucking mad right now. Fucking stupid fucking

323
01:05:36,889 --> 01:05:45,670
thing. I just want to be spoiler free. Like what the fuck? Mr. God. I haven't seen like

324
01:05:45,670 --> 01:05:52,539
Star Wars episode three yet. Like no, not the sequel. I'm talking about like the actual like

325
01:05:52,539 --> 01:06:18,550
the prequel trilogy. Don't fucking talk about it. What's wrong with me? I'm angry. All right,

326
01:06:18,550 --> 01:06:26,230
I used all my anger powers and now I'm a little slowed down. This is post anger. Oh, I have to

327
01:06:26,230 --> 01:06:36,019
go this way. Don't talk to me. I'm angry. Yeah, this really is like the don't. Kids playing down

328
01:06:36,019 --> 01:06:40,440
here. I remember when it used to be quiet.

329
01:07:07,260 --> 01:07:14,219
They added a 5G tower too. I knew that was gonna happen. Fucking angry. God damn it. I knew that

330
01:07:14,219 --> 01:07:17,260
was gonna happen. I'm so mad that we saw that.

331
01:07:30,860 --> 01:07:33,340
This really is just he's very angry walking around.

332
01:07:42,059 --> 01:07:45,420
That's the face that a little kid makes when they don't get to ride the ride at Disney.

333
01:07:53,820 --> 01:08:05,530
Do you want some lunch? No. Do you want to insert your favorite thing that I know you love?

334
01:08:06,329 --> 01:08:52,119
No, but they do get reversed. I do have a health bar. It's just Batman. It's just Batman.

335
01:08:52,920 --> 01:09:02,250
It's Batman with a much, much larger window to actually walk in. This is Batman,

336
01:09:02,250 --> 01:09:05,369
but the game freezes and tells you the button to press for five seconds.

337
01:09:05,369 --> 01:09:27,590
Well, purification for private joji. I'll have the same line.

338
01:09:28,229 --> 01:09:31,590
Destruction, destruction, destruction, destruction.

339
01:09:58,979 --> 01:10:01,859
Okay, who made this? I know Capcom, but what's Capcom? Which Capcom?

340
01:10:01,859 --> 01:10:27,210
What Capcom studio?

341
01:10:30,500 --> 01:10:35,880
Almost dead. Why is he fighting these things?

342
01:10:44,760 --> 01:11:01,289
Cyber what? Capcom Canada. Is that a real company? CyberConnect. CyberConnect 2.

343
01:11:03,989 --> 01:11:14,060
Unregistered HyperCam 2. Unregistered CyberConnect 2.

344
01:11:14,779 --> 01:11:27,720
All ships, prepare for purification. Didn't we already beat this guy?

345
01:11:29,319 --> 01:11:45,989
All ships, release. Wait, back to back bosses. What a lucky turn to find the traitor.

346
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:54,600
All right. Whoa.

347
01:11:58,760 --> 01:12:07,350
Not quite. He's on the ground though. Get him. Get up. Get the combo up.

348
01:12:14,489 --> 01:12:17,859
All right. That hurts a lot. I'm actually going to die.

349
01:12:18,739 --> 01:12:36,970
I'm going to build up my QTE meter. I hope I don't have to do hard.

350
01:12:38,010 --> 01:12:44,420
Oh, it's all right. I'll be all right. Everything's going to be fine. Don't worry.

351
01:12:46,500 --> 01:12:59,670
He's almost dead. I don't want to use my QTE thing. I almost got him.

352
01:13:00,149 --> 01:13:25,689
He's on. Okay. Bonehug Crusher. Impurity level 680. It's now I have to fight a giant

353
01:13:26,329 --> 01:13:42,229
elephant. Just keep getting more and more logical. What did he just do? I was eating their souls.

354
01:13:44,789 --> 01:14:02,890
Did they get to go back into the bodies? Nope. Right now he's sitting there going.

355
01:14:03,689 --> 01:14:09,210
Is it dead? Is this fucking thing dead? I hope so. What did I be doing?

356
01:14:19,340 --> 01:14:33,479
There's always a bigger fish. We go. We do it again. Let's go. No. Next episode, we'll do that.

357
01:14:40,090 --> 01:14:43,930
I'm going to be completely honest. What the fuck is the point of that?

358
01:14:44,409 --> 01:14:50,010
This game's interesting. I like this game. It's actually interesting, but what is the point of

359
01:14:50,010 --> 01:15:11,850
that? It's not TV. Why is it there? Pacing commercial, but there's no commercial.

360
01:15:12,890 --> 01:15:27,859
It'd be funny if there was commercials, like made up products. The Seven Deities. Wisen.

361
01:15:27,859 --> 01:15:59,270
What? I can do that? Shut him up.

362
01:16:10,039 --> 01:16:26,550
Your wrath too? Let's go. All right. Does it dash? I can't lock on. Come on. He's on the ground. I

363
01:16:26,550 --> 01:16:37,109
can't. Can I get away from that? Does it blow up or something? Does it explode?

364
01:16:45,100 --> 01:16:55,930
What's that? What's that? Throw it back. Yep. Come here. Come here. Come here. Come here.

365
01:17:20,090 --> 01:17:30,300
Omega well, tuber voice. What? Am I doing a tuber voice? When? When did I do a tuber voice?

366
01:17:31,260 --> 01:17:54,310
This guy's fucking dead. No, he is. Oh shit. He's going to come back up.

367
01:17:56,260 --> 01:17:59,460
Wisen fucking sucks laughing my ass off. No, he doesn't. It's not over.

368
01:18:02,100 --> 01:18:16,409
All right. I didn't think he was going to be this huge. Jesus. Okay.

369
01:18:29,779 --> 01:18:32,020
I feel like it should be a lot deeper and a lot more echo.

370
01:18:37,460 --> 01:18:39,779
His voice should be a little deeper.

371
01:18:46,890 --> 01:19:00,380
Press B again. Do I have time to go, go let Otto in here?

372
01:19:00,380 --> 01:19:03,899
Otto wants to come in here. I don't think I have enough time. Hold on. Let me pause the game.

373
01:19:08,100 --> 01:19:12,090
Otto wants to come in and hang out.

374
01:19:16,170 --> 01:19:23,939
And then on the next episode, they replay the last five minutes that just happened

375
01:19:23,939 --> 01:21:09,960
until we get to that point again. All right. I'll be right back. All right.

376
01:21:12,119 --> 01:21:29,050
This is going to introduce Terma to Jojo. Jojo's Jojo's Bizarre Adventure. New video episode four.

377
01:21:29,050 --> 01:21:36,100
Old friends, new enemies. I feel like it's not long enough to have it be an episode.

378
01:21:39,539 --> 01:21:49,189
Each episode is four and a half minutes. Jo, Otto, I can't. I cannot. I do not have any clothes on.

379
01:21:50,659 --> 01:21:53,300
I have no clothing on. I can't turn the webcam on today. I'm sorry.

380
01:21:54,100 --> 01:22:02,579
All right. Here we go. Uh, it seems Asura has returned to this world. You don't say.

381
01:22:03,539 --> 01:22:07,619
Apostress, that's impossible. Nothing is impossible. It actually sounds like fun.

382
01:22:08,500 --> 01:22:14,630
Oh, fuck. Redeem a wink.

383
01:22:17,210 --> 01:22:19,689
I, all right. I, I'm going to have to put on clothes.

384
01:22:20,729 --> 01:22:28,460
Nobody redeemed a wink. No, they did not. Oh, hold on. This is bad. I gotta,

385
01:22:28,460 --> 01:22:30,939
do I really have to go? Oh, did somebody actually do that?

386
01:22:32,460 --> 01:22:41,939
No, they didn't. I'm looking right now. I don't see anything. Yeah, they fucking, it's fake.

387
01:22:41,939 --> 01:22:46,100
Let's say they faked it. I haven't done anything to see it. No, they did not. There's no wink.

388
01:22:47,369 --> 01:22:56,180
They didn't. Oh my fucking God. What, what do I have? What do I do? I don't know what to do about

389
01:22:56,180 --> 01:25:02,739
this. I'm, I can't turn away. I have to go put on a shirt. Fucking God damn it. I need to make sure

390
01:25:02,739 --> 01:25:32,100
this is. You see it? This is the fucking thing you plugged in. Right one. God. Ah, my black

391
01:25:32,100 --> 01:25:58,949
key is not even plugged in. Wait. Get some USB slots. No, my motherboard sucks and it's fucked

392
01:25:58,949 --> 01:26:08,789
up and I have to get a new computer. Okay. All right. Here you go. You ready? Motherfuckers.

393
01:26:08,789 --> 01:26:34,390
I got a haircut too. There you go. That's the only thing I have. What do you wear? This is,

394
01:26:34,390 --> 01:26:38,470
this is like a suit, a suit top. I don't have anything clean right now.

395
01:26:43,640 --> 01:26:47,880
I just did it. You look nervous because I don't have to. Okay. I'm going to keep this on

396
01:26:48,439 --> 01:26:57,270
just in case something happens. I got to like button it up. Professional streamer.

397
01:26:58,550 --> 01:27:03,189
What is this link? All right. I'm trying to watch my favorite animated television show. Okay.

398
01:27:03,750 --> 01:27:13,319
What does fucking naked mean? What? What? What? What? I know. Yes. Yeah. I don't,

399
01:27:13,319 --> 01:27:18,760
it doesn't matter. It's fine. Uh, I know. I'm not showing this on stream, but that's fine.

400
01:27:19,640 --> 01:27:26,119
Here we go. I'm going back to the game. Yeah. I know my audio wasn't synced

401
01:27:26,840 --> 01:27:38,460
because I'm playing an Xbox game. Joe Otto. No, I can't. Is nothing but a speck of dust

402
01:27:38,460 --> 01:27:43,180
of the past. Indeed. Our power was nothing compared to what we are capable of now.

403
01:27:45,529 --> 01:27:51,289
Joe Otto. I cannot sh- Okay. I'm going to be completely and totally transparent with you guys.

404
01:27:51,930 --> 01:27:57,770
The reason why I can't show Otto is for very specifically. I don't have a shirt on. I have

405
01:27:57,770 --> 01:28:05,779
a suit fucking jacket on and I have a pair of shorts on that. That's it. I can't, I cannot

406
01:28:05,779 --> 01:28:18,859
do webcam right now. So I can't do that. I'm not prepared for this. Put on a shirt. I don't have,

407
01:28:18,859 --> 01:28:28,789
I don't have any shirts. They're all being in the laundry room. This is bullshit. No,

408
01:28:28,789 --> 01:28:32,550
I can't even prove this because I'll get banned. No. Well, all right. All right. That's it. That's

409
01:28:33,029 --> 01:28:36,149
it. Who cares? I'm just going to play the game. That's what you're here for, right?

410
01:28:36,949 --> 01:28:42,630
No, no, no. This game sucks. I don't like this game. Where is this ultimate Shrek Hulk game?

411
01:28:43,189 --> 01:28:49,659
Okay. I think there was a time when we had to actually exert effort to purify one large goma.

412
01:28:50,220 --> 01:28:56,140
Oh, how pitiful we all once were. How shall we proceed, my lord? If it pleases you,

413
01:28:56,140 --> 01:29:02,569
I can depart immediately to purify him. I've already sent Weizen. Let him take care of our

414
01:29:02,569 --> 01:29:06,810
old friend. I already beat Weizen. That's if you don't know. I can imagine the look on

415
01:29:06,810 --> 01:29:10,170
Asura's face now. He hasn't the slightest idea how powerless he is right now.

416
01:29:11,529 --> 01:29:16,970
We like Fortnite. Well, good. I'm glad you do. You'll never see that channel on this. You'll

417
01:29:16,970 --> 01:29:20,010
never see that channel. You'll never see that game on this channel. Whatever.

418
01:29:23,029 --> 01:29:28,550
I think you'd be surprised to explain. There are no guarantees in battle. Nothing is impossible.

419
01:29:28,550 --> 01:29:47,319
Ha ha ha ha ha. We like Fortnite. Play it, old man. You play it. You have 11,000 subscriptions

420
01:29:47,319 --> 01:29:57,930
and can't afford a shirt. What? You want me to go buy a bunch of fucking expensive shirts?

421
01:29:59,109 --> 01:30:08,550
Why? Go buy a bunch of expensive shirts. No. What? Why would I do that? I have like eight Star

422
01:30:08,550 --> 01:30:16,420
Wars shirts and like two blazers and two and like four shorts. They're fine. And I have like a

423
01:30:16,420 --> 01:30:24,920
couple of nice shirts. I have some nice jeans. You want to go spend like 600 bucks on like a nice

424
01:30:24,920 --> 01:30:30,680
button up that I'll wear once a year? No, I can wear my 12 dollar Star Wars shirts every day and

425
01:30:30,680 --> 01:30:48,010
not have to spend a thousand dollars. All right, here we go. Do I have to hold up? Oh, this is

426
01:30:48,729 --> 01:30:55,369
use left stick to drag the reticle over enemies to lock on press wide release all the blasts

427
01:30:55,369 --> 01:31:05,989
at once. The more lock-ons you have, the more powerful the blast will be. Is that it? I actually

428
01:31:05,989 --> 01:31:20,060
like this game. It's fun. Just go. It's easy. I was reading chat. Sorry, not going to get a perfect

429
01:31:20,060 --> 01:31:39,699
now. You can fail. This is just shadow of the Colossus, but far less buttons. All right. I'm

430
01:31:39,699 --> 01:32:16,659
getting hit. All right. Yeah, I'm getting hit. Nick Donald's of the Colossus. Oh, dude. The

431
01:32:16,659 --> 01:32:20,340
best part about that is I was a little too deep down in the dirt and he didn't even,

432
01:32:21,220 --> 01:32:33,539
he didn't depress it down any further. So I was fine. I was too deep down in the rock. This was

433
01:32:33,539 --> 01:33:04,409
loud. She suffers and to bring about like a shitty DJ, get like four buttons to the DJ pauses

434
01:33:04,409 --> 01:33:15,819
all the music that does that. And then turns the music back on where it left off six arm.

435
01:33:16,619 --> 01:33:37,210
Oh, I can actually hit. Wait. Oh, he's attacking. Okay. I thought he was wicked far away. I thought

436
01:33:37,210 --> 01:34:01,619
he was like a thousand meters away. I thought that was him. Go super damage. I'm not going to

437
01:34:01,619 --> 01:34:31,960
chat right now. Let's wait and do this. I throw it back. There we go. There we go. Throw it back.

438
01:34:34,250 --> 01:34:44,939
First, we demand attention. Streamer goes on coke and loses all clothes.

439
01:34:45,420 --> 01:35:17,979
This still exists. Can we end this? Oh, I thought I was, I jumped. Oh my God. Oh, fuck. I'm going to

440
01:35:17,979 --> 01:35:40,439
die. Okay. I can't, I can't get hit anymore. How do I dodge this shit? I'm dead. I got disconnected

441
01:35:40,439 --> 01:36:00,310
from Xbox. Why? What the hell did I do? Throw it back. Throw it back.

442
01:36:13,369 --> 01:36:26,600
All right. First. So burst is just go into a cut scene and continue. Spin it around.

443
01:36:27,159 --> 01:36:47,460
Come on by his fingers. Throw. Here we go. Ooh, that was quick. That was weird. That slowed down.

444
01:36:48,180 --> 01:37:18,810
Okay. We're good. I can't hit it that fast. It's not registering when I do it too fast. See,

445
01:37:20,439 --> 01:37:23,720
I'm pressing it a million miles per hour. You guys know how far I can do that.

446
01:37:24,520 --> 01:37:41,850
It doesn't know. It doesn't register some of them. Please explode. Explode. I got this laser on.

447
01:37:41,850 --> 01:38:00,699
This thing is so hot. I was waiting for him to do a big breathe in like, and you think you can beat

448
01:38:00,699 --> 01:38:05,500
a god? And that asteroid like sucks into his throat. That's probably what would happen.

449
01:38:10,939 --> 01:38:27,399
That, I mean think about how powerful that breath is. You have a phase three. It's even bigger.

450
01:38:34,119 --> 01:38:56,789
I am an absolute unit. Hey, we'll see you on the next episode. He never stops growing.

451
01:38:58,409 --> 01:39:02,939
What do you, what do I do about this now? The guy's as big as the three or four planets.

452
01:39:08,220 --> 01:39:22,859
Gongenweisen. Holy shit. He set up like a pull shot.

453
01:39:29,909 --> 01:39:35,590
Oh, that's a pretty big finger. That big, that finger is the size of like New Hampshire. We've

454
01:39:35,590 --> 01:39:56,939
got to be careful. Stop. Stop. Let's go. Oh God. And it's hot too.

455
01:40:12,119 --> 01:40:16,439
Holy shit. All right. This game just increased the full letter grade.

456
01:40:30,739 --> 01:40:37,859
It wasn't me. I have decided to save. Nice bit rate. Great rebirth. Why do I have,

457
01:40:37,859 --> 01:41:07,220
why is my memory in like 1200 up? Bro, come on. I can do it faster, but it won't register a lot

458
01:41:07,220 --> 01:41:37,670
of them if I do it too fast. I'm doing it so fast. What? Oh my God. Which way, which way do I go?

459
01:41:38,390 --> 01:42:20,149
I was going the other way. Oh, the sad part is we lost the entire Western hemisphere because of

460
01:42:20,149 --> 01:42:40,550
that. Hey, look, there's your cool explosion. Did I just destroy earth? Why are you here?

461
01:42:41,590 --> 01:42:49,659
Is this a spider? Do you even know what you want? You have already failed once at living.

462
01:42:55,619 --> 01:43:05,930
You are a fool. Next time. Do not come back. Who is going to repair my auto mail?

463
01:43:16,140 --> 01:43:27,909
Total rank C. Oh, sorry. I got a B. Sixth armed Azra Asura.

464
01:43:31,289 --> 01:43:42,649
Concept art. New video. New achievements. Cool. Next episode. Let's go.

465
01:43:43,609 --> 01:43:57,960
Robin Atkin Downs. Yeah, he is in this game. Episode five. Hello, victory. Impossible. How

466
01:43:57,960 --> 01:44:04,310
could Wyzen have lost to him? He has brought shame to the seven deities. In all honesty,

467
01:44:04,310 --> 01:44:10,710
I'm not surprised Wyzen was the weakest among us after all. He lost the moment he believed that

468
01:44:10,710 --> 01:44:17,989
size equals strength. So we're going to have to do the thing that Asura did to him. We just have

469
01:44:17,989 --> 01:44:24,739
to shrink to like one thousandth his size. There's going to be like a tiny ant boss, right? I would

470
01:44:24,739 --> 01:44:36,039
assume. In any case, the real problem is the fact that fat idiot wasted a significant amount of the

471
01:44:36,039 --> 01:44:43,659
mantra, an amount that took us so long to accumulate. That fool. Our cause will not waver because of

472
01:44:43,659 --> 01:44:57,270
something as trivial as this. Who cares about the cause? I'll kill him for fun. Not so fast. A large

473
01:44:57,350 --> 01:45:01,029
coma has appeared on the surface with Wyzen gone. I need someone to handle it.

474
01:45:02,390 --> 01:45:05,590
And have someone handle it. I only follow what my blade thirsts for.

475
01:45:06,550 --> 01:45:10,649
Everybody in the room, their eyes just all rolled to the back of their fucking head.

476
01:45:14,359 --> 01:45:19,800
Oops. While you two were arguing, Yasha went after Asura himself. He, he, he.

477
01:45:22,569 --> 01:45:37,319
That could be fun to watch. After the defeat of war. No. We're just going to get boss, boss, boss,

478
01:45:37,319 --> 01:45:40,680
boss, boss. End of the game. That's so funny. They're all just going to come one by one and die.

479
01:45:41,720 --> 01:45:55,020
In extravagant fashion. This one's got to take a few steps and like walk into a sign.

480
01:45:55,579 --> 01:46:11,590
Next time. His head just rocks back. Just like, ba-boom. It hits him like in the mouth a little

481
01:46:11,590 --> 01:46:15,189
bit too. It's like really bad. You know when somebody like really actually walks into something

482
01:46:15,189 --> 01:46:24,100
and it fucks them up. Like they hit someone like the face, the mouth. What? Asura, why have you come

483
01:46:24,100 --> 01:46:31,420
back? Okay. This is my brother. We were, we were, we were at a mall. Hold on. This is like funny.

484
01:46:31,420 --> 01:46:36,460
We were at a mall and we were, I don't know why I'm thinking about this right now,

485
01:46:37,260 --> 01:46:43,640
but we were walking together and I don't know what happened, but there was a sign,

486
01:46:44,680 --> 01:46:48,680
you know, like in the mall, those signs that the little stand up signs with, it's like a

487
01:46:49,479 --> 01:46:53,399
rectangle that's in this little metal frame and it's just on a single stand.

488
01:46:54,359 --> 01:47:00,920
Do you guys know what I'm talking about while they have those? It's just a single stand sign

489
01:47:00,920 --> 01:47:07,880
that's up at about like four or five feet tall. All right. So we're walking around and there was

490
01:47:07,880 --> 01:47:15,500
a poster for a Goldie Hawn movie. Goldie Hawn movie. I don't know which one it was. And it was,

491
01:47:15,500 --> 01:47:20,220
it was like, Goldie Hawn was in the middle and there was other two other people next to her.

492
01:47:21,020 --> 01:47:25,739
And she was like just sitting there and he was like, hey, look, we should go see that movie.

493
01:47:25,739 --> 01:47:29,180
And he was just making like a joke, let's go see that movie. But he wasn't paying attention

494
01:47:29,180 --> 01:47:38,460
in front of him. He just, boom, like rocked into this sign. It was fucking crazy. I have this

495
01:47:38,460 --> 01:47:50,140
memory burned in my brain forever. It was like, it was just, I haven't thought about this in like

496
01:47:50,140 --> 01:47:56,600
25 years, but he was pointing and going, hey, let's go see that movie. And then right when

497
01:47:56,600 --> 01:48:01,640
he got to the V in movie, he just like, his head just rocked. He was fine. The thing didn't weigh

498
01:48:01,640 --> 01:48:11,220
that much. It was just kind of, it was just, it was just like ridiculous. Oh, it's not like a joke

499
01:48:11,220 --> 01:48:15,779
or anything. Like it was just, I have that burned into my brain forever. And I'm like seeing it

500
01:48:15,779 --> 01:48:22,859
again. He failed the QTE. No, he didn't fail the QTE. He was reading chat and wasn't paying

501
01:48:22,859 --> 01:48:33,430
attention. That's a silent film joke. No, I'm just, now I keep seeing it. It was like a cartoon.

502
01:48:33,430 --> 01:48:39,640
All right. I'm not going to pay attention. I don't have any arms.

503
01:48:47,130 --> 01:48:58,329
Avenge your wife's death. I can't even fight this guy. It is pointless to resist.

504
01:48:58,970 --> 01:49:06,569
She's the Travis voice. Am I supposed to lose? Just dodge? This guy just sounded fair.

505
01:49:13,609 --> 01:49:18,569
Fuckhead. Stop making me laugh. I keep seeing my brother walk into the sign.

506
01:49:19,529 --> 01:49:26,579
Avenge your wife's death. Take back your daughter.

507
01:49:31,430 --> 01:49:34,949
Watch it. All right, he's got to dodge. I just think he's walking off.

508
01:49:41,399 --> 01:49:46,710
Dodge and then go at him. I'm going to fucking attack him.

509
01:49:50,409 --> 01:50:08,260
Wait, should I dive kick him? I'm going to dive kick him. That's worse. Wait, I can do that.

510
01:50:08,260 --> 01:50:21,319
Avenge your wife's death. Take back your daughter. You got a big Buddha.

511
01:50:22,470 --> 01:50:30,140
It is pointless 12,000 years ago. That was your fate. Leave it at that.

512
01:50:31,819 --> 01:50:53,930
Thanks for you in this world. What? I can't do it. All right, almost good. I got it. I got it.

513
01:50:54,729 --> 01:50:56,579
Do I dodge?

514
01:51:05,380 --> 01:51:43,109
Don't kill me. Don't kill me. Oh, there it is. Get out of here. Did I miss? You can miss.

515
01:51:47,270 --> 01:51:50,630
You can miss that. I thought it was just press RT and watch a movie.

516
01:51:51,670 --> 01:52:36,649
What do you mean it was two? No, it wasn't. Let's go. I get it. I got it now. I got it. I got it.

517
01:52:41,180 --> 01:52:51,909
Avenge your wife's death. Take back your daughter. Come on. Do the swing. Two swings.

518
01:52:55,670 --> 01:53:10,649
Nice. Good combo. It's pre-recorded. No, it's not. Stop saying that. Don't say that.

519
01:53:27,270 --> 01:53:29,430
Yes, I am. I used to be one of you. Wasn't I like number eight?

520
01:53:30,229 --> 01:53:50,970
Oh, shit. All right, here we go.

521
01:53:53,050 --> 01:54:19,989
Burst. Come here. Come here. Come here. Oh, shit. I got it. I think I missed.

522
01:54:20,149 --> 01:54:32,220
Look at you. You cannot hide. Oh, then I won't be able to see.

523
01:54:44,470 --> 01:55:04,199
Whoa. I mean, that's a pretty, that's pretty, come on. That's like a, that's a boss move.

524
01:55:05,399 --> 01:55:11,750
I'm not even worth avoiding because they don't hurt you. Damn. Oh, boy.

525
01:55:11,750 --> 01:55:43,739
Oh, fuck. Did I get it? Pretty sick T-pose. Oh, no. I got to be careful.

526
01:55:46,489 --> 01:56:16,649
Run. I can avoid that. Oh, fuck. What's he doing? Run. Quick hit him with a visceral attack.

527
01:56:17,289 --> 01:56:24,659
Oh, I got greedy.

528
01:56:35,319 --> 01:56:47,960
Can I fire? Oh, what's happening? Yeah, I keep trying to do it, but I can't. I'm not getting it

529
01:56:47,960 --> 01:57:28,390
right. All right. Don't fuck this up. No. Sorry. I got it. Shit. Please don't. All right. Don't use

530
01:57:28,390 --> 01:57:55,739
it. Not yet. It's not a, no choke. Here we go. I said, all right, hopefully this guy didn't

531
01:57:55,739 --> 01:58:05,289
raise to be 5,000 times the size. There is nothing you can do as priestess. Mithra has

532
01:58:05,289 --> 01:58:11,909
dedicated herself to the salvation of our world. You should be proud. What did you say?

533
01:58:11,909 --> 01:58:25,609
Hey, be proud. Oh, he's making me angry. He's devoted to the cause in order to save the world.

534
01:58:25,609 --> 01:58:36,569
I'm going to say the thing that makes you angry again. You motherfucker.

535
01:58:37,930 --> 01:59:10,859
Boy. Lava. Did I put it on? Can I just like worm my body over there and slide it on my face? Does

536
01:59:10,859 --> 01:59:15,239
it do anything to me? Is it like putting the mask on in the Jim Carrey movie?

537
01:59:28,550 --> 01:59:40,619
As is your temper, but he's ugly before the cause.

538
01:59:50,819 --> 02:00:00,729
He did the, am I cut in half? Do not return again.

539
02:00:01,689 --> 02:00:11,340
Still getting credits for this game. I think I know who wrote the game by now.

540
02:00:11,979 --> 02:00:26,729
Witness the salvation of the world from the depths of Naraka.

541
02:00:32,520 --> 02:00:43,750
Bad ending. Yeah. I mean, I could say that thing that everybody says, but

542
02:01:00,250 --> 02:01:25,109
does this turn into kingdom hearts? Where's the goofy? Where's Donald Duck? Where's Mickey?

543
02:01:29,210 --> 02:01:48,279
Presented by Capcom. Coming up next on the next episode of Asura's Wrath. That was part one.

544
02:01:49,239 --> 02:02:18,779
Part one is its own season of TV. What's going to happen is it's going to open up the next one and

545
02:02:18,779 --> 02:02:29,750
it's going to be like, I'm going to start slow and you're going to hear, oh, you're kidding me.

546
02:02:33,539 --> 02:02:42,569
We're going to get a full recap of what happened in the first part of part two. We're talking like

547
02:02:43,369 --> 02:02:54,180
potentially 10 hours of gameplay shown in about four minutes. And they do that in kingdom hearts

548
02:02:54,180 --> 02:02:59,989
too. They, they like showed, they just like skipped the whole portion of the game, right?

549
02:03:06,460 --> 02:03:20,920
Clip that one. Why? Is that bad? I mean, probably. We're singing 2020. Don't bookmark it then.

550
02:03:27,289 --> 02:03:30,569
All right. This will be the second time we've taken your father from you. Won't it?

551
02:03:32,390 --> 02:03:37,880
When is the half life stream? I've never said I was going to play half. All right.

552
02:03:37,880 --> 02:03:44,899
Why do you put words in my mouth? I said, I wasn't going to play halfway. I was.

553
02:03:46,229 --> 02:03:51,539
What your most used dance on playing halfway. I don't think I'm going to play. I'm not going

554
02:03:51,539 --> 02:04:03,130
to be playing half life on this stream. Hey, so when's half life? I, this will be the second

555
02:04:03,130 --> 02:04:08,899
time we've taken your father from you. Won't it be? He didn't even know what a Lambda was.

556
02:04:10,020 --> 02:04:14,520
When this is all over, you'll have the right to take my life and I will accept death. Gladly.

557
02:04:14,520 --> 02:04:22,359
It's going to be tomorrow. No, it's not. I guess I've played half life like six times.

558
02:04:22,359 --> 02:04:28,859
I'm not playing half life. No, I don't want to play half life. I'm not playing half life

559
02:04:28,859 --> 02:04:34,140
too. It makes me want to puke. It makes the boat level makes me sick. It's a really good game.

560
02:04:34,699 --> 02:04:52,949
But for now, you will have to wait. Just watch this episode with me. It's the only way we need

561
02:04:52,949 --> 02:04:59,590
your power. The world needs it. Alitra is constantly unleashing Goma upon the world.

562
02:04:59,590 --> 02:05:02,869
If we do not have mantra to fight against them, there is no hope for civilization.

563
02:05:03,590 --> 02:05:12,180
Your power to amplify mantra is our sword and shield. We cannot bring salvation to Gaia

564
02:05:12,739 --> 02:05:19,289
without you. Half life, half life, half life, half life. Let's go. No, no, no, no, no, no.

565
02:05:22,979 --> 02:05:29,750
Sura, why do you choose not to listen to reason? Mithra's power is essential to the cause. Once we

566
02:05:29,750 --> 02:05:45,960
defeat the Alitra, Mithra and the world will be saved. Stubborn fool. 500 years later, 12,000.

567
02:05:45,960 --> 02:06:03,659
1000. It's a long time. Part two. Rebirth. Stubborn fool won't play half life.

568
02:06:05,659 --> 02:06:10,899
God damn it. Wait, we did this? We're doing this again?

569
02:06:20,859 --> 02:06:35,689
We meet again. You are a demigod just as they are, you know. If you can accept their actions,

570
02:06:36,569 --> 02:06:42,039
perhaps you should let go and allow your soul to become one with Gaia again.

571
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:48,260
Hey, can you, can you, can you bite me? Do you choose to move forward?

572
02:06:48,260 --> 02:06:50,899
I feel like that would be beneficial to me. Just bite me right in the neck.

573
02:06:50,899 --> 02:06:58,180
This is exactly why your soul will never belong to the Goma nor the seven deities.

574
02:06:59,220 --> 02:07:04,329
There is a great power hidden in you. No, not even Spider-Man. Just, I feel like this thing's

575
02:07:04,329 --> 02:07:07,770
powerful. Just like, bite me. And like, inject venom into my bloodstream.

576
02:07:29,260 --> 02:07:34,840
Remember. If we're two hours into the game and I get another

577
02:07:35,560 --> 02:07:42,520
part two tutorial, it's gonna be tutorial two. They're gonna introduce a mechanic or something.

578
02:07:46,890 --> 02:08:27,850
Or maybe not. What's the point of this? Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill. This is the beginning.

579
02:08:41,430 --> 02:09:05,000
It's elephant fall. This should be fun. What happened to the first hour?

580
02:09:07,029 --> 02:09:12,310
I got framed for something I didn't do and then they made lore based around how bad of a person

581
02:09:12,310 --> 02:09:18,789
I was and how evil I was. Those people have since taken over the world and now I need to

582
02:09:18,789 --> 02:09:23,670
come back and take it over and tell everybody that they're bad people, I think. I don't know.

583
02:09:24,390 --> 02:09:36,729
I think there's a telegraph system.

584
02:09:41,430 --> 02:09:52,170
Merrick, Merrick, Merrick, Merrick, Merrick. Got it. Why am I fighting the elephant? Oh, why not?

585
02:09:58,840 --> 02:10:21,399
Which leg? What? Yeah, this is some entity. This is an entity. These are entities.

586
02:10:21,399 --> 02:10:26,359
They're called gomas. They're apparently, I don't know, evil or something or they're part of the

587
02:10:26,359 --> 02:10:31,560
world, the inside the world, inside the crust, to the earth's crust, the core. There's like lava

588
02:10:31,560 --> 02:10:43,289
enemies and I don't know. We'll find out. They're demons. Yeah, the demons that live inside the

589
02:10:43,289 --> 02:10:46,250
planet or something and we're trying to stop them from coming out and killing everybody.

590
02:10:47,689 --> 02:11:04,500
How am I gonna get hit by that? I'm so pissed off about that one. Let's end this.

591
02:11:05,380 --> 02:11:20,600
This time, shoot it. Wait, you mean shoot it? Can I just shoot it? Oh, what a good idea that is.

592
02:11:21,399 --> 02:11:40,739
No, look, I can't shoot it anymore. No, it's it. Here we go. Let's do the worst. One tusk down.

593
02:11:49,060 --> 02:12:15,180
All right, now what? Part two. What's that? Holy shit. Okay, well, that happens very quickly.

594
02:12:15,979 --> 02:12:28,039
It goes up and then, okay, here it comes. It goes up and then, no,

595
02:12:30,300 --> 02:12:37,100
it does it two times in a row. Oh, fuck. Oh, my God. I don't know the timing on it. I'm gonna die.

596
02:12:40,340 --> 02:12:57,460
Oh, damn it. I think it doesn't. This one's easy to avoid.

597
02:12:58,260 --> 02:13:03,579
Can you just pick a side and just get away from that side? Oh, my fucking God. Yeah,

598
02:13:03,579 --> 02:13:05,579
you just have to get away from the side that it's on.

599
02:13:23,590 --> 02:13:38,060
All right, that's not building. That doesn't build any pressure. What the hell am I trying to do?

600
02:13:39,020 --> 02:13:46,539
What's that? Oh, God. What the fuck? Oh, it's a dodge through it.

601
02:13:52,279 --> 02:13:59,140
This game had an anime, did it? I just lost 50% of my HP.

602
02:14:00,100 --> 02:14:03,220
This is what happens when you read a chat room when you're supposed to be playing a game.

603
02:14:04,180 --> 02:14:07,779
God damn it. What am I streaming right now?

604
02:14:26,760 --> 02:14:56,420
Oh, my God. I'm gonna die again. Come here. Does this do extra damage? No.

605
02:14:57,300 --> 02:15:04,979
Press LT. Yeah, I can't like hit him or anything. Do you want me just to punch him? No, I mean,

606
02:15:04,979 --> 02:15:24,180
I can't. Where's he going? Oh, my fucking God. Jump? It's hard to tell which side he's gonna pick.

607
02:15:24,819 --> 02:15:45,850
Oh, God. Here we go. He's gonna do the stupid beam. Do it twice? Stay in the middle?

608
02:15:52,460 --> 02:15:56,630
I can't get hit. I can't get hit. I can't get hit. I can't get hit. I can't get hit. I can't get hit.

609
02:15:56,630 --> 02:15:59,430
Don't get hit. Don't get hit. Don't get hit. Don't get hit. Don't get hit. Don't get hit. How long is

610
02:15:59,430 --> 02:16:13,100
it gonna be for? How long are you gonna do this for? What's this? New move? All right, come on.

611
02:16:13,739 --> 02:16:51,620
Just don't get hit. Stop. I'm fine. Which side is he gonna do? I don't know.

612
02:16:54,200 --> 02:17:11,340
What's this? Oh, come on. Shoot him? I can't. I can't. Come on. All right, dash. Dash at me.

613
02:17:29,129 --> 02:17:40,120
Burst. What the fuck just happened? Oh, yeah, this cut. It's too nerve-wracking.

614
02:17:41,000 --> 02:17:52,649
Forgot they were QTEs. No, I didn't forget. I just wanted to see what you guys were saying.

615
02:17:54,569 --> 02:17:59,219
Why do I miss those? Because I look to the left and there's a chat room over here.

616
02:18:00,969 --> 02:18:04,250
And I go, what did somebody say? Whoops. Missed the QTE.

617
02:18:05,209 --> 02:18:34,549
Control yourself. Where did this guy even come from? Immersing oneself in battle like that.

618
02:18:35,670 --> 02:18:44,520
Well done, Asura. Now that you have something to protect, why are you so full of rage?

619
02:18:45,159 --> 02:18:55,350
Perhaps. Just a massive hand. That is exactly why. Something to protect? Nonsense.

620
02:18:56,309 --> 02:19:03,670
The only reason one needs to fight is the fight itself. That is so like you, master.

621
02:19:03,670 --> 02:19:09,510
They all have big hands. We have cleared this area of Goma. Let us return to Shinkoku.

622
02:19:10,549 --> 02:19:25,299
Right. Oh, why are they all elephants? Is there something in the lore as to why they're elephants?

623
02:19:44,569 --> 02:19:55,020
Your father has returned. Welcome home, dear. Thanks. Giant enemy baby.

624
02:19:55,100 --> 02:20:10,340
So that is what he must protect? Yes, though you may not understand why.

625
02:20:18,389 --> 02:20:29,049
Easy. Whoa. I'm sorry, I'm just so angry. Please take it. Oh, and he just turns around and just

626
02:20:29,049 --> 02:21:11,459
fucking punches a wall. Brother. Looks scared of her. Then he should pacify her. Him? That's

627
02:21:11,780 --> 02:21:42,059
an abrupt cut. Not bad, Asura. That uncontrollable rage of yours suits you well. See what I mean?

628
02:21:44,100 --> 02:21:47,059
And I didn't do anything. You just told everybody to move.

629
02:21:48,979 --> 02:21:57,219
And I said move, but they didn't. Asura, join us. Should we work together? We could more effectively

630
02:21:57,219 --> 02:22:04,860
exterminate the Goma. Test me. You are aware of Mithra is the only suitable vessel to become

631
02:22:04,860 --> 02:22:23,690
priestess. Praise her with care. Incompetent as you may be. Well, now I know. You certainly are

632
02:22:23,690 --> 02:22:33,219
incompetent. I wager that is one of your more charming features. At least we know now the

633
02:22:33,219 --> 02:22:44,489
source of the flame that burns in your soul. In other words, you... Stop. What was that?

634
02:22:44,489 --> 02:22:59,399
I can't kill the spider. Hey, Lois, remember that time I fought the Goma?

635
02:23:04,299 --> 02:23:19,299
What do you mean? That was kind of funny. Hey, Lois. Minus two family guy jokes. No,

636
02:23:19,299 --> 02:23:24,500
come on. That's like kind of funny. That's kind of funny. That's kind of funny. You got it.

637
02:23:24,579 --> 02:23:28,649
That was humorous.

638
02:23:53,610 --> 02:23:57,690
I just grab the end of his web and like slurp and like suck it up like spaghetti.

639
02:23:58,809 --> 02:24:12,940
Every time we're down here, I talk about killing this thing. I don't know why.

640
02:24:13,340 --> 02:25:17,430
That's kind of fucked up. You were in the lava. Yeah. I mean, you can just leave me like that.

641
02:25:29,399 --> 02:25:41,299
Father's duty, episode seven. Is that part of the elephant or what? Yeah, maybe it was.

642
02:25:42,979 --> 02:25:49,100
Here we go.

643
02:25:49,100 --> 02:25:55,540
We continued Omega Lo. Omega Lo.

644
02:26:02,899 --> 02:26:08,659
Usher is residents thousands of years earlier. Seems that you made quite an impression in the

645
02:26:08,659 --> 02:26:15,780
last battle. Is that so? Pithra was praying for you the whole time. You hear my prayers, father?

646
02:26:16,500 --> 02:26:19,620
I did. I felt your presence with me and thought of you the whole time.

647
02:26:20,579 --> 02:26:26,500
So you didn't think about me at all? Hmm. No, I meant, oh, father, hee hee hee.

648
02:26:27,219 --> 02:26:39,670
General Osura, the next priestess has been chosen. What? General Osura's daughter Mithra is to be

649
02:26:39,670 --> 02:26:56,489
priestess. Congratulations, General. I can do better than that. I will not allow it. Father,

650
02:26:56,489 --> 02:27:02,700
but why? I will not have you become a tool for war. If it will give me the power to protect you,

651
02:27:02,700 --> 02:27:09,979
I will gladly become priestess. But Pithra is gifted with the power to save the world.

652
02:27:09,979 --> 02:27:16,579
She could be the key in eradicating the Goma. Shut up. Osura, wait. Where are you going?

653
02:27:19,479 --> 02:27:43,270
Can't see that. Can't have that be spoiled. Animation and touch up. Cyber Connect 2.

654
02:27:45,780 --> 02:27:49,459
I just want to see Cyber Connect 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 to all different episodes.

655
02:27:50,340 --> 02:28:09,819
No, I can do it too. You know I can. You know I can do that exact thing that's happening right

656
02:28:09,819 --> 02:28:24,229
now. You know it. I know I can do it. You know I can. You know I'm capable of it. I'm having,

657
02:28:25,110 --> 02:28:43,700
I am using a lot of control right now to not do that. I want to do it so bad. If it was me alone,

658
02:28:43,700 --> 02:28:49,540
I'd be doing it over and over again for the next hour. If I wasn't on stream, I would seriously be

659
02:28:49,540 --> 02:28:56,420
sitting here just going, and it would do it for an hour. And then Kim would come in here and be

660
02:28:56,420 --> 02:29:22,020
like, what the fuck are you doing? His arms are back. Oh, don't be such a baby. Oh, I'm a squirrel

661
02:29:22,020 --> 02:29:41,860
back. No, they don't. That's one of my favorite lines from any video game cut scene. It's delivered

662
02:29:41,860 --> 02:30:28,950
so perfectly. Wait, what? Oh, now look what you did. Now you woke up the baby. And how long it

663
02:30:28,950 --> 02:30:53,879
took. You know how long it took to get them to go to sleep. Wait, wait. All right, bye.

664
02:30:54,600 --> 02:31:01,659
Is that supposed to be a laugh? I think that was a laugh.

665
02:31:04,440 --> 02:31:11,930
Oh, we have forward progress in this level. This is an arena.

666
02:31:14,219 --> 02:31:37,909
There's somebody behind me too. Get, get. This is the Sonic Unleashed Werewolf levels.

667
02:31:38,870 --> 02:31:50,379
God damn it. Why did you have to say that? That is so accurate. Why did you have to

668
02:31:50,379 --> 02:32:14,260
ruin this whole game for me? Don't hit the baby. Watch out. Watch out for the Mario.

669
02:32:39,850 --> 02:33:10,500
Get up quick. I know a lot of you thought I was going to fail that on purpose to see what happens,

670
02:33:10,579 --> 02:33:12,500
but no, I want the good grade.

671
02:33:29,319 --> 02:33:55,799
Jesus. Goma Squasher. Hey, you go first. He's like a turtle. Here we go. Goma Squasher.

672
02:33:57,239 --> 02:34:11,340
Uh, does it run? Kind of. Pistols? Yeah. Can I fire? Can I shoot? In the head? Yep.

673
02:34:12,219 --> 02:34:21,059
Oh, it's uh, Contra. Contra for the Super Nintendo. Contra for the Super Nintendo.

674
02:34:21,059 --> 02:34:24,020
The turtle, when you hit the head and the head goes like quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack,

675
02:34:24,020 --> 02:34:37,139
quack, quack, quack. Holy shit, it's the same thing. Yep. We're working as a bunch of them.

676
02:34:37,139 --> 02:34:45,030
The stomach? All right. Yeah. Turn into the stomach.

677
02:34:47,829 --> 02:35:07,700
Back it up. Oh, that was probably exceptionally painful. Oh, does it keep going around? No,

678
02:35:07,700 --> 02:35:28,950
we're good. Right in the head. Out, out, out. I don't know what that means. What's that? Adds?

679
02:35:28,950 --> 02:35:51,799
Yep. I just summoned him, man. Just summoned him. Charge. Let's kill your own friends.

680
02:35:52,760 --> 02:36:20,010
Oh, fuck. Take his ass. Sorry, he's doing spin. No, he just double tapped. Don't triple tap me.

681
02:36:20,809 --> 02:36:41,180
All right, I'm good. What are you gonna do? Charge? Nope. All right. Settle down.

682
02:36:44,170 --> 02:37:11,180
LT is immunity? Is it really? Can you do a tail whip? Oh my fucking god. Oh my god. Oh my god.

683
02:37:11,180 --> 02:37:16,709
Oh my god. What the fuck happened? What have I done? I almost got instantly killed.

684
02:37:17,670 --> 02:37:22,629
This. Wish I knew that. I'm scared of doing anything.

685
02:37:30,280 --> 02:38:00,540
Oh, tap, tap, tap, tap. Oh my god, my nose is so itchy.

686
02:38:08,709 --> 02:38:39,559
Do a charge. The frames. Yeah, they're not very, they're not very good, are they?

687
02:38:39,559 --> 02:38:53,690
The console, this is on Xbox 360.

688
02:39:09,979 --> 02:39:11,340
But what language are they speaking?

689
02:39:11,340 --> 02:39:23,989
Stop praying. This is pathetic.

690
02:39:24,469 --> 02:39:34,139
English? Septentrion.

691
02:40:04,889 --> 02:40:10,409
So this is the reason for the unusual mantra concentration in these parts.

692
02:40:10,489 --> 02:40:25,450
Guys on a single wheel? Oh, okay. The magical wheel. Of course it is.

693
02:40:30,090 --> 02:40:32,780
I wonder what that guy's fight's gonna be like.

694
02:40:35,879 --> 02:41:11,559
Oh, it's happening right now. I don't have to wonder anymore. Boss? No? No boss?

695
02:41:12,440 --> 02:41:35,819
Uh, why'd you kill that guy? What? What?

696
02:42:04,010 --> 02:42:05,770
This guy's playing black and white.

697
02:42:11,590 --> 02:42:17,930
That's his, that's his creature. He turns around and he's like, stop doing that!

698
02:42:18,889 --> 02:42:30,170
No! Puts a leash on him. I had that, oh god damn it, I had the destruction leash on!

699
02:42:30,809 --> 02:43:03,979
The hologram really. He even pointed too, he was like, point. This little baby. Rock music.

700
02:43:07,219 --> 02:43:09,850
There's the fucking machine gun sound.

701
02:43:17,479 --> 02:43:19,719
Some battle going on somewhere with guns.

702
02:43:31,139 --> 02:43:40,149
I know what it is. There are no guns in this game, it just sounds like it.

703
02:43:41,270 --> 02:43:51,219
Can you please switch to the Japanese voiceover? It's better.

704
02:43:53,370 --> 02:44:06,280
He's already become invested in the characters while they speak up.

705
02:44:07,000 --> 02:44:12,579
I dodged it.

706
02:44:21,350 --> 02:44:24,760
Base.

707
02:44:36,760 --> 02:44:38,840
Oh, I hit him with that too. Oh, what?

708
02:44:42,459 --> 02:45:07,610
Oh shit. Where is he? Sonic unleashed.

709
02:45:17,690 --> 02:45:20,569
Can't get over it. Why did that person have to say that?

710
02:45:21,049 --> 02:45:26,979
Oh fuck, that hurt. Oh wait, there's another, there's like another mini-boss here.

711
02:45:32,459 --> 02:45:45,420
Oh shit. Sorry. Oh boy. What the hell's going on? I'm invincible though.

712
02:46:00,729 --> 02:46:21,059
What is it? What is he saying? What is he doing?

713
02:46:29,899 --> 02:46:33,579
You go tell who's responsible for this. That I'm coming for him.

714
02:46:34,139 --> 02:46:50,010
All right. Can I not do it? What if I don't want to? Can I not do it?

715
02:47:13,940 --> 02:47:23,909
Now what? Uh oh. She's learning. That's not good. I'm not putting a good example out.

716
02:47:24,709 --> 02:47:38,569
She's gonna rock in her hand. Holy shit. She's learning from you. You're the god.

717
02:47:39,610 --> 02:47:59,350
You're the reason humans are like this. No, I'm not. Stop, stop, stop. Enough. Use two hands.

718
02:47:59,350 --> 02:48:35,579
Take more leverage that way. Black and white too sure is weird. Where's the baby? Yeah, where's the

719
02:48:35,579 --> 02:49:03,590
baby? You, you let me. Baby got League of Legends ganked. I don't, I kind of, I kind of know what

720
02:49:03,590 --> 02:49:08,739
you mean by that, but I don't at the same time. I don't know what that means. Sort of. I don't know

721
02:49:08,739 --> 02:49:24,260
what that means. I mean, I kind of do. Not really. Villager B. Episode 8, willing sacrifices. All

722
02:49:24,260 --> 02:49:43,020
right. Let's go. Village on the outskirts of Shinkoku. Here within this stone lies remains

723
02:49:43,020 --> 02:49:48,860
of the fallen demigod who defied the seven deities long ago. He succeeded in killing one of them,

724
02:49:48,860 --> 02:49:52,540
but at the cost of his own. Following the divine battle, the remaining deities

725
02:49:53,500 --> 02:49:58,379
abandoned this land declared a curse for all eternity. It is believed the fallen demigod

726
02:49:58,379 --> 02:50:04,459
continues to watch over this land, but the Goma rarely appear in these parts. For this reason,

727
02:50:04,459 --> 02:50:09,180
the villagers enshrined his remains and worship from afar, who do not dare approach the shrine

728
02:50:09,180 --> 02:50:20,579
out of fear. There was one little girl, however, who regularly came to the shrine and offered

729
02:50:20,579 --> 02:50:25,510
flowers to the fallen demigod. Long ago, when she and her father went off to a nearby village,

730
02:50:25,510 --> 02:50:30,629
they were attacked by the Goma. Just when they thought their lives were over, the seven deities

731
02:50:30,629 --> 02:50:35,270
came from the heavens and purified the Goma. The little girl was deeply relieved that the deities

732
02:50:35,829 --> 02:50:46,700
have saved them. However, the deities did not only purify the Goma and thus many humans were

733
02:50:46,700 --> 02:50:51,340
caught in the fires of their purification. The girl's father was one of those who perished,

734
02:50:52,219 --> 02:50:57,079
but rather than defy the deities for their tyranny, the villagers saw it as an honor.

735
02:50:57,639 --> 02:51:01,879
They rejoiced that the deities would lead their souls to heaven and gladly gave their lives.

736
02:51:03,000 --> 02:51:07,479
The girl walked hopeless and full of despair until she stumbled upon the shrine of the

737
02:51:07,479 --> 02:51:14,280
fallen demigod. As the old tale said, the stone had an aura of anger that the girl was not afraid.

738
02:51:15,340 --> 02:51:19,180
Somewhere in the fallen demigod's face, she saw a resemblance to her late father.

739
02:51:20,059 --> 02:51:23,579
Since then, the girl has been visiting the shrine to offer flowers.

740
02:51:30,819 --> 02:51:33,379
Everyone did nothing but pray, but he took action.

741
02:51:35,559 --> 02:51:38,120
But oh, this is not a narrator. Wait for me, I'm coming with you.

742
02:51:42,540 --> 02:52:00,020
Jerma, are you the CEO of Jerma, Incorporated? No, I mean, I guess you could say like, sure,

743
02:52:00,340 --> 02:52:06,920
yes, I guess. You're doing the infomercial voice. Yeah, because it's the narrator.

744
02:52:10,360 --> 02:52:31,879
You, you let me handle them. Let's do the CEO. The best laid plans, episode nine.

745
02:52:41,850 --> 02:53:12,870
That was pretty, that was full. God, I'm really hating skip sections. You can't skip them either.

746
02:53:12,870 --> 02:53:45,530
They're getting angry. It's pretty nice to be able to get Chip and Dale to get angry.

747
02:53:46,250 --> 02:54:05,030
They just had to press a button and skip the sequence. Actually not that bad. Six arms,

748
02:54:05,030 --> 02:54:13,659
no? Minus two, nobody likes Kingdom Hearts. I just, I just made fun of Kingdom Hearts.

749
02:54:13,659 --> 02:54:30,649
Roger, all ships commence exorcism. I like Kingdom Hearts one and two a little,

750
02:54:30,649 --> 02:55:02,579
I guess. I like Kingdom Hearts one. I don't really remember to. I'm in the ship. Let's go.

751
02:55:03,379 --> 02:55:10,469
I'm not the one who started this fire. It's always burning as the world's been turned.

752
02:55:10,469 --> 02:55:14,729
Now, but it will burn you to ash. It's pretty much the same thing I said.

753
02:55:14,729 --> 02:55:17,610
Roger, all ships commence purification.

754
02:55:17,610 --> 02:55:31,540
I have to do some firing the sky.

755
02:55:36,809 --> 02:55:51,590
Oh, come on. What am I aiming at here? What am I aiming at? This, these things.

756
02:55:57,819 --> 02:56:10,809
Those, these ships, these ships, everything. I'm gonna watch the right side of my screen.

757
02:56:16,250 --> 02:56:21,110
Aim, forehead. No, it's yeah, you're right.

758
02:56:21,909 --> 02:57:04,649
Oh, no, you cannot take the full brunt of a star. That's the worst line ever.

759
02:57:18,020 --> 02:57:19,139
Only if it kills me.

760
02:57:32,469 --> 02:57:39,739
That's what, oh, that's what a, that was a fun movie. Who else liked that movie? Raise your hand.

761
02:57:39,739 --> 02:57:43,100
Did you like that movie? Who liked that movie?

762
02:57:43,100 --> 02:57:53,049
I cannot allow fear any further. He will ruin everything.

763
02:57:53,049 --> 02:57:54,409
You haven't watched it yet? What?

764
02:57:55,370 --> 02:57:57,770
Roger, destroy the traitor.

765
02:58:05,590 --> 02:58:12,149
Marvel fanboy. It was a good movie. It was fun. It was, it was cool.

766
02:58:13,270 --> 02:58:18,459
Sometimes I forget. Don't ever like anything in 2020.

767
02:58:21,940 --> 02:58:28,569
Don't like anything. Oh, what a fucking consumer.

768
02:58:28,569 --> 02:58:59,930
You can't like anything. You can like anything else, just not Marvel. What movie?

769
02:59:07,979 --> 02:59:29,430
What movie? Some of us don't watch movies, but superheroes are lame.

770
02:59:31,510 --> 02:59:35,510
No, I knew we were going to get here eventually. I just didn't know when.

771
02:59:38,629 --> 02:59:42,549
Enough people liked Marvel for it now to be, ah, stupid lame.

772
02:59:44,969 --> 02:59:47,610
Enough people started to watch like Captain America had happened.

773
02:59:48,489 --> 03:00:03,819
Stupid, stupid, stupid. I only drank the finest of movie wine.

774
03:00:18,629 --> 03:00:33,700
Reddit has ruined everything. Oh my God. I'm instantly dead.

775
03:00:37,159 --> 03:00:50,680
Oh, I didn't time it correctly. Oh shit. It starts all the way back here.

776
03:00:51,479 --> 03:00:57,989
All right. That's the thing with the nature of like the internet. All right. So,

777
03:00:58,549 --> 03:01:03,989
back in the day it used to be, if you had a group of maybe like eight people you ever

778
03:01:03,989 --> 03:01:08,549
communicated with back like 20 years ago, you had to call somebody on a landline to like

779
03:01:09,510 --> 03:01:14,229
talk to them. And no, no one was going to call your landline to be like, hey,

780
03:01:14,229 --> 03:01:19,829
Marvel movies are stupid. But now, there's so many opinions.

781
03:01:21,819 --> 03:01:26,299
But you didn't get random prank calls. People dialing random numbers going, hey,

782
03:01:26,299 --> 03:01:30,729
by the way, Spider-Man's dumb. You'd be like, who the fuck is this?

783
03:01:53,639 --> 03:02:02,860
You talk to like eight people ever. Your mom, your dad, the person who lived across the street from

784
03:02:02,860 --> 03:02:10,180
you and like two people you went to school with. And if one of them didn't like Spider-Man, well,

785
03:02:11,059 --> 03:02:21,979
okay. Well, yeah, like simply. Now you can, you can hear from anybody on earth,

786
03:02:21,979 --> 03:02:29,079
any of their opinions instantly right now. Like right now this 5,000 people here. You guys can

787
03:02:29,079 --> 03:02:34,680
give your opinions on anything. And we could just have a huge, just disgusting bubble of the world

788
03:02:34,680 --> 03:02:40,520
and like movies. And half of you would hate the other half because they don't like Spider-Man.

789
03:02:41,159 --> 03:03:11,209
I hate the other half. All right. I can't die here. This is important.

790
03:03:12,010 --> 03:03:17,420
Come on. You're a nerd. Yeah. So what?

791
03:03:27,270 --> 03:03:46,840
Come here. Come here. Come here. Kill it. Kill it. Ah, still alive. How are you still alive? Okay.

792
03:03:47,399 --> 03:03:55,379
All right. Now it's just you. I don't like Spider-Man on pizza. Now neither do I.

793
03:03:59,610 --> 03:04:07,180
Can I build up shit with this? Are they going to keep blocking? Oh my God. He just gave me a free

794
03:04:07,180 --> 03:04:38,489
kill. Are you kidding me? Oh, come on. I'm all right. Watch out. Watch out. He's coming.

795
03:04:58,139 --> 03:05:06,040
Thank God. I like this. I like this. I like this. I like this.

796
03:05:11,270 --> 03:05:31,989
Cookie dough is tasty. Yeah, it is. I think that's redemption troop. Colonel

797
03:05:32,950 --> 03:05:48,200
Eisen. You don't. Oh, that was quick. That was really quick. I hope it's right there. Don't be

798
03:05:48,200 --> 03:05:58,180
all the way back. Thank goodness. All right. It comes quick. Laser. It's a very slow laser.

799
03:05:58,180 --> 03:06:15,219
He's trying to let me win. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on.

800
03:06:16,739 --> 03:06:47,290
Oh, his name is mouth. Here comes boss. Intruder detected in the mantra chamber.

801
03:06:47,930 --> 03:07:05,370
All right. Is it weird that I want to eat his hair? That's weird. All right.

802
03:07:09,610 --> 03:07:17,829
Those are the mortal souls that have been harvested into mantra.

803
03:07:17,829 --> 03:07:23,670
These ships, send them to heaven. You son of a bitch.

804
03:07:23,670 --> 03:08:08,840
What? I knew that was going to happen. How do you like your hair? Oh, I don't.

805
03:08:08,840 --> 03:08:21,420
Where did these guys come from? Where did. Oh, I don't have any. It's walking on.

806
03:08:22,379 --> 03:09:26,840
Come here. Come on. Come on. Come on. Don't kill me. Come on. He's dead. He is dead. Shit.

807
03:09:28,579 --> 03:09:40,360
What the fuck are these things doing? I just think it's freaking me out. I think through the

808
03:09:40,360 --> 03:10:37,510
explode. Holy shit. I need to hit one person. Come on. Why? What? I can't do. Why not? Jesus.

809
03:10:47,750 --> 03:11:08,889
Walk to the door. What? What do you mean walk to the door? No, I have to kill this guy.

810
03:11:13,350 --> 03:11:20,950
I have a preemptive burst. Oh, now I have to use burst on door.

811
03:11:35,100 --> 03:12:06,059
Throw it back. Of course it's an elevator sequence. We have to have an elevator sequence.

812
03:12:09,100 --> 03:12:21,899
Elevator sequences are universal. There's no health now. There's no health in this game either.

813
03:12:21,899 --> 03:13:38,520
There's a spider. Yeah. Not dead. Oh, come on. I actually just get killed in one hit there.

814
03:13:39,239 --> 03:13:55,049
I thought he was dead. I have to do the whole elevator again.

815
03:14:05,819 --> 03:14:20,819
Skip to the boss. Not impossible. Play the game first. Who's next? Here comes one, two,

816
03:14:20,819 --> 03:14:25,899
three. Are these guys stuck in the corner?

817
03:14:29,799 --> 03:14:53,030
Dead? Yep. This is where I fucked up last time. I'm ready. One, two, three, drop.

818
03:15:03,780 --> 03:15:08,500
Okay. I'm going to hold the super. No, I'll just use it.

819
03:15:09,459 --> 03:15:31,340
Do it again. Again? How many fucking times do I have to do this?

820
03:15:33,739 --> 03:16:00,389
I have to RT this guy. Turn off the game, please. Okay, yeah, sure. But I'm done.

821
03:16:01,190 --> 03:16:47,610
It's the stock alarm. All right, let's go. Are you done yet? No, not yet. Is that another hologram?

822
03:16:47,610 --> 03:17:22,360
Come on. Do I have the DLC? I don't have the DLC. I didn't know I needed the DLC to beat the game.

823
03:17:26,409 --> 03:17:37,510
Okay, this fight's probably going to be me ripping him out and just snap his neck.

824
03:17:39,260 --> 03:17:42,700
I don't think this is going to be a big epic boss fight, guys. I think I'm just going to

825
03:17:42,780 --> 03:18:11,129
break this guy's neck. Oh, I'm crushing him.

826
03:18:32,950 --> 03:18:44,309
Garnet him into paste. That's the plan. Oh, I actually knew that wasn't going to be a big fight.

827
03:18:46,200 --> 03:19:00,549
Yeah, I just crushed his head. Wait, am I going to be broken apart again?

828
03:19:28,059 --> 03:19:36,870
Finally, a use for a shitty emote. I know who this guy is at this point. You don't have to keep

829
03:19:36,870 --> 03:20:02,889
telling me. Who is this guy? August? August, yeah. August? Episode nine. In the books. D.

830
03:20:03,770 --> 03:20:17,909
Hey, how do I get D on top? Because I restarted, right? But didn't somebody say there were 13

831
03:20:17,909 --> 03:20:35,909
episodes? I'm almost done. Let's go. 18 episodes. Well, all right, let's fucking go. We're at number

832
03:20:35,909 --> 03:20:37,110
10. Number nine.

833
03:21:09,579 --> 03:21:16,260
That wasn't as cool as the first one. Now, now let's not get hasty. It's in such bad taste. I'm

834
03:21:16,260 --> 03:21:21,059
sure August would be more than happy to take our little care of our problem. Fine. Where is he?

835
03:21:21,059 --> 03:21:24,899
What could he be doing? All right, we're going to fight August. Where do you think he is?

836
03:21:27,860 --> 03:21:40,549
This next one is really, really good. Okay. This fight is amazing. This is the best part.

837
03:21:42,149 --> 03:22:05,049
Well, let's go. This next one is my favorite. Oh, well, you're setting this up here. There we go.

838
03:22:07,590 --> 03:22:31,590
Words of wisdom. What? Why is he? Oh yeah, I have these arms. I forgot. It's like a baby

839
03:22:31,590 --> 03:22:33,989
realizing he has fingers and hands.

840
03:22:34,549 --> 03:22:43,260
Then eat good food. You fight, then drink fine wine. You fight, then sleep with beautiful women.

841
03:22:43,260 --> 03:22:50,329
Hell, beautiful women. That's what it means to live. It's hobbit music.

842
03:22:56,500 --> 03:23:02,659
I am not like you. It kind of was. I didn't say anything about it because it's a Lord of the

843
03:23:02,659 --> 03:23:14,600
Rings reference and people might be angry at me, but it kind of does. This is rated. Where's that

844
03:23:14,600 --> 03:23:54,340
box? This is T for team. We're fine. What? Why? Wait, let's go. I don't fuck around. Flash? Flash

845
03:23:54,340 --> 03:24:15,190
who? That's a dick move. Okay. So look around. Well, what's he doing? Who the fuck is that? Hey.

846
03:24:16,069 --> 03:24:30,010
All right. What's he doing? Hey, I'll do that too. Okay. Now what are you doing?

847
03:24:30,170 --> 03:24:45,350
That's pretty good cat puke. All right. What about just regular drink?

848
03:24:45,909 --> 03:25:04,870
Hell, there's a different one here. What does stand up do? To show how big I am?

849
03:25:25,020 --> 03:25:31,020
All right. I filled my meter. Why splash? I don't know. That's an option.

850
03:25:32,219 --> 03:25:57,129
No, I'm not ready yet. I'm not ready yet. Does it keep going? This is getting worse.

851
03:25:58,090 --> 03:26:23,180
I have another. I can't even move. All right. First stand up. It's burst time.

852
03:26:28,469 --> 03:26:45,670
What? This was T. This is T for team. God damn it. What? Why is he naked? This just says T on the box

853
03:26:46,309 --> 03:27:17,129
and it's team. Don't be a soccer mom. I didn't do anything.

854
03:27:17,850 --> 03:27:30,790
They're all to depend on. That's why weisen and cow row were so weak. Don't be a soccer mom.

855
03:27:32,309 --> 03:27:41,159
They are unsatisfying. Things were different before. Yes, we used to fight side by side.

856
03:27:42,340 --> 03:27:49,110
Those were the days. You remember when we did this? Let's go back and find out.

857
03:27:51,989 --> 03:27:55,110
Viewers went up by about 200 or 300 viewers during that segment, by the way.

858
03:27:56,809 --> 03:28:33,430
Your minds are just in the gutter. Come on. What do you mean the thumbnail? That's fine.

859
03:28:33,430 --> 03:28:52,010
Thumbnail's fine. The guy looking at the moon. It's not the guy. I just looked at it. I just

860
03:28:52,010 --> 03:29:32,299
looked. It's not there. It's not there. No, it's definitely not. Recommended live channels. Yeah,

861
03:29:32,299 --> 03:29:40,579
but you is that that's it might not be real though. He's left. Let's go this way.

862
03:29:50,569 --> 03:30:08,420
Goma charger. All right, let's do it. We're in Goma with Rhino. Two of them.

863
03:30:09,540 --> 03:30:23,700
Fuck. I'm gonna dodge and then do a dab punch instead. All right, good. Good.

864
03:30:28,700 --> 03:30:38,920
Dude, Nintendo in chat. Hey, welcome back. All right, I have to stop paying attention to what

865
03:30:38,920 --> 03:30:56,149
you guys are doing. You're losing viewers. You have to do something about that. Well,

866
03:30:56,149 --> 03:31:17,690
they were here for one reason and I don't that whatever. Oh, shit. Well, I really should have

867
03:31:17,690 --> 03:31:45,590
used that now. Jesus. Oh, my God. No help. Oh, here it comes. Go to kill him. What was that weird?

868
03:31:45,590 --> 03:31:53,180
Okay, that was you see that turn. That was like an instant turn. Instant turn. Hopefully,

869
03:31:53,180 --> 03:32:29,100
it's right there. Why is chat focused on everything but the game? Well, I think it's because

870
03:32:31,899 --> 03:32:34,860
that sometimes like to do its own thing and just

871
03:32:35,659 --> 03:32:54,500
they go off on their own. Hence, tends to happen because we're bored.

872
03:32:57,350 --> 03:33:19,819
I'll get some like Nickelodeon gag and fucking play with it. Oh, don't you fucking dare screw

873
03:33:19,819 --> 03:33:31,190
this up. Please be dead. Please be dead. Please be dead. It's not dead. It's not dead.

874
03:33:31,190 --> 03:34:10,709
I almost have enough. There it is. Invincible. Burst him. You saw boobs. It's over.

875
03:34:12,549 --> 03:34:29,129
You didn't. You saw somebody in a bath. A big one. That's it. Another turtle. Oh,

876
03:34:29,129 --> 03:34:39,299
we've already seen the turtle. This is not a new enemy.

877
03:34:39,299 --> 03:34:47,540
I got hit by it. I got hit by the end of it.

878
03:34:52,040 --> 03:35:02,459
I want to get killed. Get hit in the back. Get hit in the head. It's not doing anything.

879
03:35:06,860 --> 03:35:22,389
Giant enemy turtle. That's right. Dude, how the fuck am I supposed to avoid that? That seems

880
03:35:22,389 --> 03:35:32,979
unavoidable. Run? He just run away. I can't dodge it.

881
03:35:36,040 --> 03:35:43,500
Can I leave? Can you do something? Oh, you're not. Just jump. You gotta jump.

882
03:35:52,280 --> 03:36:01,430
Invincible. Just spam. Spam. Spam. Spam. Spam. Spam. Spam. Spam. Spam. Spam. Spam. Spam. Spam.

883
03:36:01,430 --> 03:36:14,889
Just keep doing that. Invincible. Watch out.

884
03:36:26,280 --> 03:36:32,569
He's learning. Yes. Very slowly, but I am.

885
03:36:41,590 --> 03:36:49,030
If I get hit once, I'm dead. So that'd be very, very, very sad. What are you gonna do?

886
03:36:49,670 --> 03:37:03,850
Eh. Shoot him. I can't.

887
03:37:07,420 --> 03:37:27,770
You can build your meter. It doesn't work. It's not doing anything. That's not doing shit.

888
03:37:32,389 --> 03:37:49,610
Your other meter. Oh, the other meter. Right. Right. The LT meter. Well, in that case, let's do it.

889
03:38:07,159 --> 03:38:20,569
Whoa. He just spawned a fucking rhino. Why didn't he spawn a rhino? It's all right. I have some

890
03:38:20,569 --> 03:38:39,370
invincible. I'll get it. Come on. Stop spinning. Stop spinning. Holy shit. Oh my God. Oh my God.

891
03:38:39,370 --> 03:38:54,540
Oh my God. Oh my God. Fuck. I need to watch the. Did I fail them both? I think I failed them both.

892
03:38:55,100 --> 03:39:02,219
I keep forgetting this. Whatever. Every time there's a cutscene, I go like, yeah, I got a

893
03:39:02,219 --> 03:39:09,850
minute. Let's look over here. What are you guys saying about this thing? I have to focus the

894
03:39:09,850 --> 03:39:13,209
whole time I'm playing against the enemy and I look over. Hey, what are you guys doing?

895
03:39:13,930 --> 03:39:23,340
How have you been, guys? It's in QTEs. It's just less points. Oh, that's all right.

896
03:39:23,340 --> 03:40:02,540
All right. At least this is different. What is this? Fish. Not fair. We're fighting over who

897
03:40:02,540 --> 03:40:18,729
gets to kill the giant fish monster. To be continued. Episode 11. Wow. That was a pretty

898
03:40:18,729 --> 03:40:34,659
long dream. I'm going to go now. You're fighting rhinos and elephants and shit in your dreams,

899
03:40:34,659 --> 03:40:50,170
man. You got to stop. You got to stop eating hamburgers at 11 o'clock. It's a boomer joke.

900
03:40:50,729 --> 03:40:57,659
Will I turn 35 this year? Get over it. It's going to be more and more of that. I'm going to fucking

901
03:40:57,659 --> 03:41:20,120
on. I'm trying to turn 35 in like three days. Episode 11. We actually get to fight this guy.

902
03:41:26,459 --> 03:41:30,299
They say Lord August has gone off to find the fallen one. The traitor

903
03:41:30,299 --> 03:41:35,739
was Lord August's pupil, was he not? Yep. You think Lord August sympathizes with the fallen one?

904
03:41:37,639 --> 03:41:41,639
No. Lord August is one of the most merciless of the seven. I believe he's gone to finish the

905
03:41:41,639 --> 03:41:50,840
traitor off. Where did Lord August go? Kanazuki spring. Lord August always goes there to bathe

906
03:41:50,840 --> 03:42:02,059
before a battle. You guys see squidbillies, right? Who's the lady that lies down like this

907
03:42:02,059 --> 03:42:18,260
in squidbillies? Earl's like wife. It's the same stance. What's his name? Hurly? Hurly. Yeah.

908
03:42:18,260 --> 03:42:25,370
I wouldn't be so sure Lord Wyzen and Lord Calro were defeated. Who is to say that Lord August will

909
03:42:25,370 --> 03:42:34,420
fare any better? We've obviously never seen Lord August in battle. You would not say such things

910
03:42:34,420 --> 03:42:39,879
if you had. I know because I was a soldier thousands of years ago during the War of Creation.

911
03:42:40,520 --> 03:42:43,399
No one can defeat Lord August. He's very well made. He's stronger than

912
03:42:43,399 --> 03:43:04,979
Lord Deus. Now enough of your babble. Move it. Yes, sir. Awesome. I'm turning 21 in a couple weeks.

913
03:43:04,979 --> 03:43:12,389
Do you have any good drink recommendations? Yeah. Do you like wine? Well, you don't know

914
03:43:12,389 --> 03:43:26,469
because you can't drink yet. You might. Wine's good. This will do. A good red wine. It has some

915
03:43:26,469 --> 03:43:31,030
good fruity deep flavors to it. Malbec is my favorite wine. Absolutely.

916
03:43:34,069 --> 03:43:46,389
Vodka pineapple is also just perfect. What's this song? All right. This is awesome.

917
03:43:48,489 --> 03:44:02,780
I'm fighting on the moon. Let's go. This is a great setting for a fight.

918
03:44:03,829 --> 03:44:13,590
Because there ain't shit on the moon. So there's plenty of room. Okay. Well, he just destroyed me.

919
03:44:14,549 --> 03:44:37,639
Oh my god. If I get hit, I'm dead. I took all of my damage at the very beginning of the fight.

920
03:44:37,639 --> 03:45:06,200
That's great. What's this? Get it. Put perfect fight music. Oh, fuck. I just walked into it.

921
03:45:15,500 --> 03:45:19,659
All right. Now I know what's going on. Two, three, four.

922
03:45:20,299 --> 03:45:27,860
There it is. Yes, this is the hardest. Is it on hard? Is there a difficulty after hard?

923
03:45:34,360 --> 03:45:47,479
Harder. Wow. This isn't too bad. It's really nice. You die in like three hits, but

924
03:45:47,479 --> 03:45:51,399
it's not too bad. This probably would have been too easy on normal.

925
03:46:07,000 --> 03:46:19,590
Do I lack critical information? Somehow. Why? What that means?

926
03:46:20,069 --> 03:46:40,700
Okay. That's a good sign. Get it. Get it. Come on. Yes.

927
03:46:52,100 --> 03:47:16,389
Again? What the fuck? What's going on? Okay. Again. Again? Dragon ball fight is kind of ridiculous.

928
03:47:17,110 --> 03:47:35,659
Again?

929
03:47:49,239 --> 03:47:50,680
Here comes the sword.

930
03:47:59,379 --> 03:48:13,420
On the next episode. Is it going to do that to us?

931
03:48:14,469 --> 03:48:20,629
As deity, the only other person August has ever drawn his sword against is you, my Lord.

932
03:48:22,440 --> 03:48:27,030
Is he that powerful? Oh, interesting.

933
03:48:34,280 --> 03:48:50,739
You guys. Deus means God, by the way. All right. Cool. That's my favorite comedy. I love that.

934
03:48:51,459 --> 03:49:20,729
Great. They caught it. Jesus. And whoa. Jump. All right. It's time to make it all the way to him.

935
03:49:20,729 --> 03:49:27,110
Yeah. Definitely. What the fuck is that? Whoa. All right. No, we're not good. We're not good.

936
03:49:27,110 --> 03:49:56,139
He does it twice. Just two swings. Fuck. Oh my God. Holy shit, man. What the hell is this?

937
03:50:02,180 --> 03:50:12,600
All right. Now the music's distracting. How did we see the opportunity to hit him?

938
03:50:13,239 --> 03:50:49,209
Thank God. It's not the whole fight. Shoot him. Breathe. All right. Yeah. He does three.

939
03:50:50,250 --> 03:51:36,229
Holy shit. What's happening? Give me that meter. Let's do it. Two, three. More, more, more, more,

940
03:51:36,229 --> 03:51:45,899
more. Get in, in, in, in, in, in. All right. Fine. Just get it. All right. Don't. Don't blow this.

941
03:51:45,899 --> 03:51:49,739
Don't use it. Wait till he does it before he comes over to you. There we go.

942
03:51:50,459 --> 03:51:54,340
What? Oh shit. He didn't do the thing I thought he was going to do.

943
03:51:59,500 --> 03:52:15,079
Don't. Don't. Don't. I just need to. He's going to dash. There it goes. To use it. No. I used to

944
03:52:15,079 --> 03:52:39,610
miss the four. This is an extra long sword.

945
03:52:40,250 --> 03:52:50,569
Is it going to be this big for the rest of the fight? That should be pretty cool. He's got this

946
03:52:50,569 --> 03:53:18,489
huge hole. Oh God. I'm losing my arms again. What the fuck is going on? How can they still

947
03:53:18,489 --> 03:53:27,739
hear each other? There's a hole on either end of that sword. They're just putting their morphoboots

948
03:53:27,739 --> 03:53:34,659
in. Don't rip your blind eyes out. Then he puts his ear up to it in your

949
03:53:51,239 --> 03:54:05,290
flashback. Oh, another meteor. Must be Monday.

950
03:54:29,110 --> 03:54:36,489
If you can hang on for this long, just lift your body up and make it settle this forward motion.

951
03:54:36,489 --> 03:54:38,809
What the hell is he going to do then? He's going to tip over and fall.

952
03:54:39,770 --> 03:55:06,760
Look forward. You made it. Did I get it?

953
03:55:16,299 --> 03:55:19,100
Harmless again for the second time today.

954
03:55:37,659 --> 03:55:43,180
It's been 12,000 years since you've lost the arm. Oh. Yeah, that's right.

955
03:55:43,739 --> 03:56:04,629
Yet you continue to fight. Anybody want a water or something?

956
03:56:04,629 --> 03:56:11,739
You no longer need my training. One who stands in the end is righteous.

957
03:56:18,379 --> 03:56:25,180
Can I get you guys anything? You know, I just love a black coffee.

958
03:56:25,739 --> 03:56:48,139
You guys have that here? Ew, black coffee minus two.

959
03:56:53,110 --> 03:56:55,829
What? If you drink coffee at a diner, I always get a question.

960
03:56:56,629 --> 03:57:02,149
Why is that? Why is that? Why is it minus two? I drink black coffee at a diner.

961
03:57:04,540 --> 03:57:09,979
Bad show. That's a big, that's a huge snake stegosaurus.

962
03:57:22,180 --> 03:57:33,559
We lose frames here. What's going on? We're good. I think we're good.

963
03:57:33,559 --> 03:57:45,659
Give it a refresh. Maybe it looks like we dropped something. I'm just walking like this.

964
03:57:46,139 --> 03:57:51,579
I'm running away from her?

965
03:57:53,260 --> 03:58:11,100
Should be good now. A little all over the place, but it'll be all right.

966
03:58:29,959 --> 03:58:33,479
Well, turn and run the other way. This is when you turn and run the other way.

967
03:58:45,780 --> 03:58:51,540
Part two, rebirth episode two. But what epi- oh no. No, no, no. That's- it's not part 11.

968
03:58:51,540 --> 03:58:56,819
Part 11, rebirth episode 11. That's not correct. They got the Roman numerals there.

969
03:59:12,020 --> 03:59:16,500
Viewers just jumped up like crazy. Oh, I- did we get front page?

970
03:59:17,540 --> 03:59:21,299
That's a lot of people that just came in. Hi guys. This has been no raid or anything.

971
03:59:22,340 --> 03:59:31,979
Is it a host from somewhere? Now they're all gone.

972
03:59:38,540 --> 03:59:47,100
That's the equivalent of, um, like you called an elevator and there's like fucking a shitload

973
03:59:47,100 --> 03:59:51,290
of people on the elevator when it opens. And then you just, you're just like, nah,

974
03:59:52,090 --> 03:59:58,899
no one's getting off and just keep going. Just keep going. Like, oh, is this, is this our,

975
03:59:58,899 --> 04:00:02,020
is this our floor? No, no, no. Someone pressed the button and there's not enough room.

976
04:00:02,819 --> 04:00:15,659
Ah, whatever. Bye dickhead. A village on the outskirts of Shinkoku in the plaza.

977
04:00:17,690 --> 04:00:22,010
No, why am I still alive? If I, if I had only prayed more, perhaps then they would have

978
04:00:22,010 --> 04:00:31,420
accepted my soul. Why is my voice high pitched? What? My voice is high pitched? Returnable.

979
04:00:31,420 --> 04:00:46,340
What? You're freaking me out. It's high? What? No, it's not. Look, look. Actually on

980
04:00:46,899 --> 04:01:00,340
the front page. Oh, well, yeah, that's cool. No, that's not the right, whatever. This was

981
04:01:00,340 --> 04:01:04,739
our chance to be guided to heaven. Oh, what are we to do now? We must pray. If we continue praying,

982
04:01:04,739 --> 04:01:12,280
they will surely guide our souls as well. What's wrong with all of you? Why do you do nothing but

983
04:01:12,280 --> 04:01:18,299
pray for death? This isn't right. I feel like I'm going to be sick. A high pitched thing is

984
04:01:18,299 --> 04:01:25,750
an audio glitch. Refresh. You literally sound like a chipmunk. What are you talking about?

985
04:01:28,860 --> 04:01:36,469
I sound, I'm high pitched? Just refresh your page. I need to leave this place. I don't want

986
04:01:36,469 --> 04:01:44,709
to be here anywhere but here. Episode 11, Zenora on episode 12. A little while later, Baron Field.

987
04:01:45,350 --> 04:01:56,299
What is that? Ah, that must be him. He's fighting in the heavens again. It can't be Agoma. Agoma

988
04:01:56,299 --> 04:02:06,229
unborn from the heavens. It has to be him. I won't just wait here and pray. I have to make it there.

989
04:02:06,229 --> 04:02:17,780
I have to get to his battle. A village. It's a mobile app bug though. Oh, whatever.

990
04:02:18,979 --> 04:02:48,489
Few days after the mysterious explosion, I turned to stone. I just keep dying, huh?

991
04:02:59,989 --> 04:03:22,059
Well, gods of death. I wink. How do you know my name? Okay, has she only seen me with no arms?

992
04:03:23,579 --> 04:03:48,600
I think this is the only impression I've ever had on this person. You're so blue.

993
04:03:49,239 --> 04:03:52,840
Because I didn't, I just plugged the mic in. I mean, I plugged the webcam in just to be able

994
04:03:52,840 --> 04:04:01,209
to do that. I'm not wearing, you know how much I'd be sweating if I had that on the whole time?

995
04:04:02,250 --> 04:04:29,420
Can I run faster? Can I trade my wink for Otto's feet? No. It very clearly says

996
04:04:29,420 --> 04:04:39,909
wink in camera. It's currently 61 in Las Vegas. Yeah, but I'm indoors wearing a suit jacket.

997
04:04:39,909 --> 04:04:44,549
Like, you know, I'm indoors in this one room wearing a suit jacket just sitting here.

998
04:04:49,350 --> 04:04:53,989
No, I'm not doing it now. I'm doing it because it's the only clothes that people that just

999
04:04:53,989 --> 04:05:12,120
came here have no idea. Why am I in a suit jacket? I just know. What a weirdo.

1000
04:05:20,620 --> 04:05:25,420
I'm not wearing it right now. No. All right. I have to explain this to a bunch of people

1001
04:05:25,420 --> 04:05:30,059
probably are here that weren't here like two hours ago. I don't have any clothes right now.

1002
04:05:30,700 --> 04:05:35,340
They're being washed. They're being, I don't have anything. I don't have any,

1003
04:05:35,340 --> 04:05:39,739
I'm literally naked right now. So I had to grab something real quick. So I have a suit jacket top

1004
04:05:40,299 --> 04:05:44,620
that if somebody has to redeem a fucking wink, I have to put on my suit jacket and

1005
04:05:44,620 --> 04:06:19,799
wink into the camera. It's a long story. That was a great image looking right. I feel like

1006
04:06:19,799 --> 04:06:25,559
that's how I look if somebody has like a camera. I went to their house and you bring their door

1007
04:06:25,559 --> 04:06:28,520
up. It's like, okay, I'm ready. And then you just look up and you're like, oh, hi.

1008
04:06:28,600 --> 04:06:32,120
Hi. I'm on camera up there. Hi.

1009
04:06:35,159 --> 04:07:11,979
Okay. That audio was full three seconds before it happened. What? I'm still out here.

1010
04:07:15,450 --> 04:07:18,649
I know I'm putting on my jacket. Just wait a second.

1011
04:07:18,649 --> 04:07:47,100
Wait, I've been live for four hours. I didn't stop in the middle of the stream to

1012
04:07:47,100 --> 04:07:54,870
change my laundry over. What? Oh, excuse me, guys. Yeah. Two hours ago, I had to,

1013
04:07:55,590 --> 04:08:26,659
I took my laundry out of the dryer. Let's see another quality content. There was not

1014
04:08:26,659 --> 04:08:40,059
another one. I can look. I'm going to do this. How am I going to do this? Impossible. This is

1015
04:08:40,059 --> 04:08:47,930
fucking impossible. How is he? How is it impossible to do this? Like, this is impossible.

1016
04:08:54,809 --> 04:09:21,690
Seriously. Fucking not even possible. See? Impossible. Two winks for deemed.

1017
04:09:22,329 --> 04:09:24,969
Hold on. Currently dealing with a fucking impossible thing here.

1018
04:09:25,129 --> 04:09:31,770
Okay. Thank you for that. Another wink. I'll hold on.

1019
04:09:38,100 --> 04:10:05,540
Hey, I know it's fake. It was real. I can smell your bullshit from a mile away.

1020
04:10:05,540 --> 04:10:15,430
There's been at least two real ones and I've done two. What's one of my lips? Oh, why am I a corpse?

1021
04:10:16,149 --> 04:10:28,870
Is this what girls do? I know it's blue, but my, why am I lips like that?

1022
04:10:28,870 --> 04:10:44,780
There is no need. That's that only take our gods are dead.

1023
04:10:49,899 --> 04:10:56,389
He's freezing. He had some food. He looked like violet from Willy Wonka. Why is he freezing?

1024
04:10:56,469 --> 04:11:08,840
Someone help him. God. Crack stream part two.

1025
04:11:37,350 --> 04:11:42,819
Who defied the seven deities.

1026
04:11:46,549 --> 04:11:53,700
I thought we didn't get the, I was really hoping we were going to get the

1027
04:11:54,180 --> 04:12:15,909
Oh, if only I had arms, why does today after 12,000 years have to be the day that I don't have

1028
04:12:15,909 --> 04:13:27,139
fucking arms? No, you mouth. That's not going to work. Blink was fake. Let me say something.

1029
04:13:28,100 --> 04:14:13,219
I've upgraded. I got my arms back. Now they have eyes on. Oh, I'm a skull girl.

1030
04:14:40,360 --> 04:14:41,000
Oh geez.

1031
04:14:53,530 --> 04:14:58,329
Okay. That was a lot. That was like just dead instantly. How many people are on this ship?

1032
04:14:59,209 --> 04:15:02,860
I don't have enough time to scream about anything. It's just like, oh my, no, no, no.

1033
04:15:03,659 --> 04:15:44,120
Are these these people in part of fight playing trauma center? I remember that game. That game

1034
04:15:44,120 --> 04:16:03,799
was crazy. Okay. What's the, what's the over under that? This is another head's wish.

1035
04:16:38,459 --> 04:17:03,659
Do it. Bullets are coming from every single missile at that.

1036
04:17:05,340 --> 04:17:41,219
They're half-assed until you can't count it. Yes. Good. I'm kind of getting into

1037
04:17:41,219 --> 04:18:05,700
bat boy territory here. It's getting there. Hey, by the way, in case you haven't figured it out yet,

1038
04:18:06,340 --> 04:18:13,860
Capcom made this game and cyber connect to also did this stuff in case every single we just,

1039
04:18:13,860 --> 04:18:23,799
let's remind you every 20 minutes. They even was a full on credit sequence where he was

1040
04:18:23,799 --> 04:18:33,370
floating around in the credits of going scrolling down the screen. I think it's a little late for

1041
04:18:33,370 --> 04:19:05,059
credits. It's animated. Okay. No, no, no. I'm sorry. You can't, you can't. And what do you say now?

1042
04:19:05,700 --> 04:19:19,989
What are you saying now about that? Okay. Those are the pre credits to the real credits

1043
04:19:23,260 --> 04:19:49,540
season two ending, please be floating. It's DLC time. No, it's not.

1044
04:19:50,500 --> 04:20:03,209
No, this is part two rebirth end. Oh, no, we got like, we got like five more episodes.

1045
04:20:04,170 --> 04:20:15,659
It's time to kill Diablo. What? I'm not even, I'm not done with this game. What are you talking

1046
04:20:15,659 --> 04:20:20,540
about? All right, man. Oh yeah. You got, you got to the end. All right, let's go. It's time to kill

1047
04:20:20,540 --> 04:20:31,979
Diablo on hardcore. Let's go. No, we have the, we're not done. Guys, I'm streaming for five

1048
04:20:31,979 --> 04:20:53,940
days in a row. There's plenty of time to kill Diablo. Yeah, we're good. This is part three.

1049
04:21:00,489 --> 04:21:09,079
Make sure to pace yourself. No, I'll be all right. We got plenty of stuff to play. So it's not like,

1050
04:21:09,719 --> 04:21:19,979
you know, I hope we can. I need stuff to do. Drink water. I've been hooked up to a saline

1051
04:21:19,979 --> 04:21:33,209
IV this whole stream guys. I'm fine. Golden spider rise and shine. Asura. I lost myself again.

1052
04:21:36,250 --> 04:21:39,290
No, you haven't lost anything. You've gained the power to save the world.

1053
04:21:41,139 --> 04:21:43,139
I could not even save a little girl with this power.

1054
04:21:44,200 --> 04:21:56,600
Oh, no, that's not, that's sorry. That's not him. Let me fix that. Oh, wait, you have a destiny.

1055
04:21:56,600 --> 04:22:02,260
I got cut off there. Somebody turned the stream off right when I got in the middle of that one.

1056
04:22:02,260 --> 04:22:05,930
You have a destiny to fulfill. I was going to scream really loud when it was like, I don't want

1057
04:22:05,930 --> 04:22:16,870
my voice to hurt. I'm streaming for five days in a row. Oh, I'm not going to do it. I'm sorry.

1058
04:22:17,430 --> 04:22:39,159
Oh, oh, testing. Overwhelming power surging through. What are you guys linking me here?

1059
04:22:39,159 --> 04:22:49,739
Kind of showing me something important. That's creepy. Freaky. What even is that part three?

1060
04:22:49,739 --> 04:23:12,379
Karma. Frogger for the Gameboy. You play as a frog. Dumbass. Even August could not defeat you.

1061
04:23:13,260 --> 04:23:22,229
Why does that make me a dumbass? Why do you keep coming back? What is it that you are fighting for?

1062
04:23:22,229 --> 04:23:29,190
And this power of yours? How can it surpass the power that took us 12,000 years to attain?

1063
04:23:30,469 --> 04:23:42,180
Needed no more heroes this week? Maybe. We'll see. We'll see. He is too much of a threat.

1064
04:23:42,180 --> 04:23:53,770
He must be stopped here and now. Ready the Bromastra. What was the Bromastra?

1065
04:23:57,750 --> 04:24:22,680
Hey, it sounds like my microphone. What was that? It's the Death Star, but this time it's made out

1066
04:24:22,680 --> 04:24:48,979
of a human in the shape of a human. This is the giant human Death Star. This is a cosmic entity.

1067
04:24:51,479 --> 04:24:57,020
You cannot do this with that one blast. Do you realize how much mantra will be lost?

1068
04:24:57,819 --> 04:25:03,459
All the souls that have been given for the cause. Do you not realize that this will hinder the coming

1069
04:25:03,459 --> 04:25:09,620
of the Great Rebirth? Then we will just get more mantra. With the mortals under our control,

1070
04:25:09,620 --> 04:25:12,659
our supply is endless. You guys never like put a crack in your iPad and don't get it fixed?

1071
04:25:12,659 --> 04:25:19,139
If we do not finish him now, there will be no Great Rebirth. Wait. I will finish Asura.

1072
04:25:19,139 --> 04:25:26,180
Like you did before. If we finish him now, once and for all, he can never come back.

1073
04:25:27,059 --> 04:25:40,549
This is made for the eradication of the Goma. This conversation is over. You will not interfere.

1074
04:25:41,430 --> 04:25:56,299
Bad guy, good guy, bad guy becomes good guy, good guy. I will not let you do this. He's drawn on

1075
04:25:56,299 --> 04:26:07,270
muscles. This dude's, he's a fat guy, but he drew on the muscles. I guess he's around all these

1076
04:26:07,270 --> 04:26:13,399
demigods all the time. I guess he needs to keep up, I guess. The mantra finishes loading.

1077
04:26:24,229 --> 04:26:26,700
I'm not going to stop this injustice.

1078
04:26:30,700 --> 04:26:34,700
Do I get to play as a new character now? I do.

1079
04:26:54,969 --> 04:27:15,100
That sound is, where is it from? It's from something. It's like a lasso or something.

1080
04:27:17,020 --> 04:27:18,340
From everything. Yeah.

1081
04:27:21,700 --> 04:27:38,340
Come here. That's a cool move. I need somebody to fight. Let's go.

1082
04:27:45,700 --> 04:27:50,459
Come here. Flip him down. I don't even know what I'm doing. I'm doing cool shit though.

1083
04:27:50,459 --> 04:28:27,020
Bad, bad, bad. Did I grab it? I didn't. Did I?

1084
04:28:40,010 --> 04:28:41,739
Excuse me. Excuse me.

1085
04:28:49,399 --> 04:28:58,309
Fake Link? I know. I think it's even a real one. Come on. What? He's not falling for it. No.

1086
04:28:59,270 --> 04:29:19,209
I need to play Ninja Gaiden. Ninja Gaiden, Ninja Gaiden, Ninja Gaiden, Ninja Gaiden.

1087
04:29:19,209 --> 04:29:28,739
Even gods are not important. Ninja Gaiden. Not Ninja Gaiden.

1088
04:29:32,659 --> 04:29:41,139
Whatever. Ninja Gaiden. The Brahmastra has entered the final preparation phase.

1089
04:29:42,100 --> 04:29:50,040
Commencing mantra charge. Mantra charge completion in T minus five minutes.

1090
04:29:51,000 --> 04:30:00,229
It's begun. I must hurry. I have Black here. Shooter, Black. That's a classic.

1091
04:30:07,030 --> 04:30:52,979
I can't hit them? Well, just take a deep breath. Go outside. Get some air. Come back.

1092
04:30:52,979 --> 04:31:11,290
All right, that's pretty cool. That's a cool vehicle. Where are they? Right here? To the right?

1093
04:31:11,290 --> 04:31:13,290
To the right? I'm going to run into them.

1094
04:31:25,500 --> 04:31:25,979
Watch it.

1095
04:31:31,459 --> 04:32:02,840
Just use it. Kill, kill. Oh, fuck. Oh, that hurt. Oh, please.

1096
04:32:15,850 --> 04:32:20,520
Is this a mobile game? Why are you just saying that?

1097
04:32:21,479 --> 04:32:27,799
You're getting me going. I think saying that because I've been playing this game for like

1098
04:32:27,799 --> 04:32:30,680
four and a half hours, so I think that saying that's going to make me be like,

1099
04:32:31,719 --> 04:32:34,360
what the fuck, dude? Mobile? Come on, dude. Give me a break.

1100
04:32:38,760 --> 04:33:26,680
All the break. Good. Just good. This would be a pretty cool iPad game, honestly. That's cool.

1101
04:33:27,479 --> 04:33:32,490
We're going to see. We're going to see it coming up in the horizon. Where is he?

1102
04:33:33,450 --> 04:33:38,409
Well, we got to see it and then now it's not here anymore. Come on.

1103
04:33:38,409 --> 04:33:41,369
I thought we were going to get a cool sequence where I ran down into his mouth or something.

1104
04:34:08,810 --> 04:34:25,610
Jesus. I can't even fucking see what's going on. How do I dodge that? Oh,

1105
04:34:28,099 --> 04:35:12,819
I'm just going to use this. Use it. Use it. Use it. Don't die. Am I using it? Going in. My health.

1106
04:35:12,819 --> 04:35:47,509
Well, final sequence. Am I invisible? Does this count as your anime for the year?

1107
04:35:49,819 --> 04:36:08,060
This is not a television show. I'm not watching this on TV. I'm playing this on my Xbox 360 console.

1108
04:36:09,259 --> 04:36:21,080
Not. This is a video game. Where am I going? That's a lot of people.

1109
04:36:21,799 --> 04:36:44,259
Am I going to get it? I didn't make it. All that for nothing. I didn't even make it.

1110
04:36:58,599 --> 04:37:20,099
I couldn't. I couldn't stop the migraine beam. Okay. Oh, well, he's going to. He can't do it.

1111
04:37:21,540 --> 04:37:56,340
Let's rewind 12,000 years and learn about why we lost. I feel like this is you guys in chat right

1112
04:37:56,340 --> 04:38:03,000
now. This is me and this is you guys about how you feel about this game. You're just like,

1113
04:38:03,799 --> 04:38:17,590
oh no. The motion. Oh, Yasha's interference has diverted the beam. Damage report. Unable to fire.

1114
04:38:19,099 --> 04:38:36,259
Damn you, Yasha. That was a big beam. Hey, some protagonists just are unstoppable. It's good to

1115
04:38:36,259 --> 04:38:42,939
see that this protagonist dies all the time and loses every fight. Cause I support it. This has

1116
04:38:42,939 --> 04:38:52,630
always turned into stone, burnt to death. I've died three times in the course of four and a half hours.

1117
04:38:53,349 --> 04:39:22,330
And one of those was 12,000 years ago. So not bad. His power of molding is infinite. He's just so

1118
04:39:22,330 --> 04:39:31,909
angry. He keeps coming back. It's a 13 causing him. I gotta take my jacket off. I'm starting

1119
04:39:31,909 --> 04:39:37,860
to sweat in this thing. I was scared that there was going to be a wink. Somewhere on Gaia. To

1120
04:39:37,860 --> 04:39:45,340
maintain my beauty, a little exercise is necessary once in a while. Consider it an honor to be purified

1121
04:39:45,340 --> 04:39:50,919
by someone with such grace. That's what I would say if any of you impure had any brains.

1122
04:39:58,200 --> 04:40:03,479
This is the only chance for you filth to shine. After dashing through the horde of Goma,

1123
04:40:04,200 --> 04:40:08,520
Serjei bows gracefully at the same moment. The Goma are ripped to shreds in the background.

1124
04:40:09,400 --> 04:40:59,110
At least you can die beautifully. Lord Serjei, I have a report. During our attempt to fire the

1125
04:40:59,110 --> 04:41:09,459
Brahmastra upon Asura, Lord Yasha interfered in deflective blast. God, guys. All right,

1126
04:41:09,459 --> 04:41:14,819
I'm just going to keep it on. How do you have this many points? How do you have like a million

1127
04:41:14,819 --> 04:41:28,330
points? Where did you get a million points? A typical of him. I knew he would show his true

1128
04:41:28,330 --> 04:41:37,270
colors one day. And what does he look in his face? Yes, sir. Lord Deus has summoned you regarding

1129
04:41:37,270 --> 04:41:46,970
the incident. Tell him I'll be right there. I got fooled? That wasn't the right thing?

1130
04:41:48,009 --> 04:42:10,009
I was at 14. Actually, my internet died for hours and you're still playing this.

1131
04:42:10,729 --> 04:42:15,180
Yeah, I'm going to play. I'm going to beat this game.

1132
04:42:24,099 --> 04:42:31,830
How is it such a foreign concept everybody? I'm going to play. I'm going to play this game today.

1133
04:42:32,630 --> 04:42:38,709
That's cool. You're still playing this? But this is what we do. Yeah, that's what I'm doing.

1134
04:42:39,430 --> 04:42:49,590
That's what I'm doing today. I know you're busy, but can I get a high five? Yeah, you can.

1135
04:42:50,470 --> 04:43:18,659
That just like scared me. Well, well, here they come. I don't know. For some reason,

1136
04:43:18,659 --> 04:43:23,459
people think that I'm going to get like halfway through the game and be like, oh, yeah, I'll keep

1137
04:43:23,459 --> 04:43:28,659
going. No, no, no. I'm going to hit the power bugs and then spike the Xbox into the ground

1138
04:43:28,659 --> 04:43:36,919
and watch it explode and then press a button and here's Jump King. Dude, why are you still

1139
04:43:36,919 --> 04:43:43,209
playing this? Get out, rip the power cord up and then press button. Here we go. Jump King.

1140
04:43:50,250 --> 04:43:59,430
Dude, how have you not spiked your Xbox into the ground already?

1141
04:44:00,389 --> 04:44:28,889
This is pretty cool. Disney ride. And they said,

1142
04:44:30,409 --> 04:44:34,250
you're getting the true ending DLC, right? This is not a joke. Here's money for it.

1143
04:44:35,209 --> 04:45:01,979
I don't know. Are you sure you don't want me to smash my Xbox? Here's $300 for a new Xbox.

1144
04:45:01,979 --> 04:45:33,020
Xbox 360 is not $300. It's like 60. It's like less than 80 bucks. What is this fish doing?

1145
04:45:34,060 --> 04:45:38,709
Does anyone have any idea of what this is actually doing? Why is it doing this?

1146
04:45:39,590 --> 04:45:48,040
Like, get the fuck away from me. No, he's just like, get out of here. Like, you're just in a way.

1147
04:46:02,520 --> 04:46:03,159
I'm trying.

1148
04:46:15,189 --> 04:46:26,970
Now, are you winning some? Yeah.

1149
04:46:27,610 --> 04:46:34,950
And because of it, three fourths of the karma fortresses mantra consumed.

1150
04:46:36,150 --> 04:46:50,409
Two hours earlier. That is everything I witnessed. My body's just hot right now.

1151
04:46:50,409 --> 04:47:03,830
Just heat is coming out of my body. But yes, I, why do you hesitate? Speak. All these years,

1152
04:47:04,630 --> 04:47:11,110
I have believed in the cause. But asura's mantra has proven powerful enough to rival that of our own,

1153
04:47:11,669 --> 04:47:18,500
that of the Brahmastra. After the blast, we lost track of his whereabouts.

1154
04:47:18,500 --> 04:47:22,419
We did not know when he might attack again. Lord deus.

1155
04:47:30,700 --> 04:47:36,619
Lord deus, I have a report to make. I used the Brahmastra on Asura. Yes, I already know.

1156
04:47:37,580 --> 04:47:42,060
You're dismissed. But my lord, Yasha tried to-

1157
04:47:42,060 --> 04:47:42,700
Dismissed!

1158
04:47:53,139 --> 04:47:59,540
Must I repeat myself a third time?

1159
04:47:59,540 --> 04:48:01,139
Who's this thing's snoked motherfucker?

1160
04:48:02,900 --> 04:48:06,380
Lord, forgive me.

1161
04:48:07,979 --> 04:48:23,500
He just sits in a chair and just goes, but you can't see, he's not any closer.

1162
04:48:33,990 --> 04:48:35,909
Yasha. Sir.

1163
04:48:39,080 --> 04:48:42,360
Power without a purpose is meaningless and worthless.

1164
04:48:43,000 --> 04:48:46,279
A purpose that is firm can change the impossible.

1165
04:48:47,159 --> 04:48:55,400
Wait, this is a boss fight right now? Stories bouncing around all over the place.

1166
04:49:07,509 --> 04:49:08,790
Here comes the boss battle music.

1167
04:49:08,790 --> 04:49:29,590
It was quite entertaining. So dedicated tennis in our fight. There is nothing more to discuss.

1168
04:49:29,590 --> 04:49:33,509
An absolute shitload of community subs just came in. About 32 nixums.

1169
04:49:33,509 --> 04:49:35,590
Sir, I want you to bring Yasha with excellent determination.

1170
04:49:35,590 --> 04:49:37,990
Thank you for the 20 community subs.

1171
04:49:38,950 --> 04:49:39,750
That's a storm.

1172
04:49:42,680 --> 04:49:45,159
Thank you. Thank you, Richard Nixon.

1173
04:49:45,159 --> 04:49:46,840
He has merely forgotten.

1174
04:49:46,840 --> 04:49:49,189
That's a lot of subs.

1175
04:49:53,580 --> 04:49:57,779
As you wish.

1176
04:49:57,779 --> 04:50:00,659
20 community subs. Goddamn, thank you.

1177
04:50:00,659 --> 04:50:06,340
Report. Large mass of Goma confirmed. They are headed for a city in the vicinity of Shinto.

1178
04:50:06,340 --> 04:50:09,459
These are just- these are the toads of this universe. We just figured it out.

1179
04:50:09,459 --> 04:50:11,060
Requesting permission for immediate purification.

1180
04:50:11,060 --> 04:50:13,459
Ah, a purification.

1181
04:50:13,459 --> 04:50:14,099
Holy shit.

1182
04:50:14,099 --> 04:50:15,220
How beautiful.

1183
04:50:16,409 --> 04:50:19,770
Uh, Snarabossus just gave 20 community subs.

1184
04:50:20,490 --> 04:50:29,529
That's 40 subs. 20 back to back. Thanks, guys. Snarabossus.

1185
04:50:31,049 --> 04:50:45,240
Can they be evolved? You can just buy a new Xbox.

1186
04:50:46,200 --> 04:50:51,509
Break something. I own one already. Why would I do that?

1187
04:51:00,779 --> 04:51:05,849
Because it's funny. It's funny.

1188
04:51:20,599 --> 04:51:21,400
Well, that was different.

1189
04:51:24,229 --> 04:51:26,389
All right, it's another elephant.

1190
04:51:27,750 --> 04:51:29,590
Ah, now here's the real filler episode.

1191
04:51:29,590 --> 04:51:30,869
We already did elephant before.

1192
04:51:31,830 --> 04:51:33,750
Elephant and turtle will both filler episodes.

1193
04:51:34,709 --> 04:51:51,830
This is elephant episode. Turtle episode.

1194
04:51:58,419 --> 04:51:59,909
Meter, meter, meter.

1195
04:52:02,229 --> 04:52:13,619
Come on. Meter.

1196
04:52:17,220 --> 04:52:18,020
There it is.

1197
04:52:18,020 --> 04:52:21,860
Oh, well, good time to use it is with two fucking rhinos.

1198
04:52:22,819 --> 04:52:25,639
Just focus on him.

1199
04:52:26,919 --> 04:52:27,900
Focus on the elephant.

1200
04:52:28,700 --> 04:52:31,180
I'm invincible.

1201
04:52:32,520 --> 04:52:38,380
Am I still invincible?

1202
04:52:39,259 --> 04:52:41,830
Doesn't matter.

1203
04:52:41,830 --> 04:52:46,759
It was so laggy. I couldn't even.

1204
04:52:47,400 --> 04:53:04,009
Offline. He's lagging offline.

1205
04:53:04,009 --> 04:53:06,569
Nice lie. Nice lie. Lagging offline.

1206
04:53:08,090 --> 04:53:17,029
Because that was a good, uh, small clip from the movie.

1207
04:53:17,750 --> 04:53:29,060
Brute ninja.

1208
04:53:29,060 --> 04:53:36,040
I feel bad about that.

1209
04:53:37,080 --> 04:53:39,319
Anybody else feel bad after watching that?

1210
04:53:40,200 --> 04:54:08,520
Who did that?

1211
04:54:09,979 --> 04:54:11,659
Septentrion, Mizar.

1212
04:54:23,659 --> 04:54:42,119
See how they're summoned to please their gods.

1213
04:54:45,590 --> 04:54:47,110
Oh, he's tossing it aside.

1214
04:54:49,270 --> 04:54:52,779
You're gonna throw it at me?

1215
04:55:03,340 --> 04:55:04,459
I thought he gave it the finger.

1216
04:55:05,259 --> 04:55:07,139
I thought he just flipped off the town.

1217
04:55:20,180 --> 04:55:21,060
What's this for again?

1218
04:55:28,680 --> 04:55:31,639
Before the mortals are devoured by the goma,

1219
04:55:31,639 --> 04:55:36,810
we purify their souls and turn them into our power.

1220
04:55:36,810 --> 04:55:39,020
This is nothing new.

1221
04:55:39,020 --> 04:55:42,619
It's the same thing you've been doing for the past 12,000 years.

1222
04:55:43,580 --> 04:55:48,490
You've just fought a meaningless battle.

1223
04:55:48,490 --> 04:55:49,610
Oh, where's their weapons?

1224
04:55:51,590 --> 04:55:52,310
Bastards.

1225
04:55:52,310 --> 04:55:58,889
One way or another, their swords muster up.

1226
04:55:58,889 --> 04:56:05,299
One's behavior has been more resting for them.

1227
04:56:05,299 --> 04:56:07,220
You ever think about just breaking fucking decap?

1228
04:56:20,520 --> 04:56:23,590
Gods must dirty their hands.

1229
04:56:24,310 --> 04:56:27,380
And then he goes to spit in his face,

1230
04:56:27,380 --> 04:56:28,900
but he forgets he has the mask on right there,

1231
04:56:28,900 --> 04:56:30,419
and it just hits him right in the bottom of the mask.

1232
04:56:41,979 --> 04:56:42,939
It was me.

1233
04:56:49,270 --> 04:56:52,229
Dead, but well, there goes another boss.

1234
04:56:52,229 --> 04:56:53,029
That's not a boss.

1235
04:56:53,750 --> 04:56:59,319
He's getting more and more Lord of the Rings golem.

1236
04:56:59,959 --> 04:57:07,159
Every time we see him, he's going full hollow at this point.

1237
04:57:22,549 --> 04:57:27,000
Hey, D, roll B, I'll take it.

1238
04:57:27,560 --> 04:57:30,340
It's time to roll credits.

1239
04:57:32,540 --> 04:57:35,659
Play an ad.

1240
04:57:39,740 --> 04:57:41,580
I can't even run ads on my channel, guys.

1241
04:57:42,619 --> 04:57:45,380
Every time I've tried, it doesn't work.

1242
04:57:45,380 --> 04:57:56,919
OmegaLul, no ad Andy.

1243
04:58:09,669 --> 04:58:11,830
Report of Asura's movements.

1244
04:58:11,830 --> 04:58:14,470
Search troop Captain Upala's log.

1245
04:58:15,189 --> 04:58:19,590
This mission to find traces of Asura's movements has proven very challenging.

1246
04:58:19,590 --> 04:58:23,110
The blast from the Brahmastra has set the land ablaze,

1247
04:58:23,110 --> 04:58:25,669
which still continues erasing any tracks Asura left behind.

1248
04:58:26,229 --> 04:58:28,630
Despite this, we carried on with our mission in the search of

1249
04:58:28,630 --> 04:58:29,509
whatever we could find.

1250
04:58:30,150 --> 04:58:33,509
Fortunately, we were able to find some footprints on a snow field quite far.

1251
04:58:35,270 --> 04:58:37,159
We followed them immediately.

1252
04:58:37,159 --> 04:58:41,319
After a while in the distance, we discovered one of our fleets in mid-battle with the Impure.

1253
04:58:42,439 --> 04:58:43,479
That is when it appeared.

1254
04:58:50,069 --> 04:58:54,549
A scorched black soot-covered body with the rage glowing in its eyes.

1255
04:58:54,549 --> 04:58:57,189
By the time we realized it was the fallen one, the battle had already begun.

1256
04:58:58,229 --> 04:59:02,389
Watching from afar, neither our fellow soldiers nor the Goma were any match for him.

1257
04:59:02,389 --> 04:59:05,909
Terrified by what was happening before our eyes, we could do nothing but hide and shiver with fear.

1258
04:59:06,950 --> 04:59:09,750
After the fallen had annihilated them all,

1259
04:59:09,750 --> 04:59:13,110
he roared out towards the heavens as if he were calling out to someone.

1260
04:59:18,819 --> 04:59:20,819
After that, I continued to pursue Asura.

1261
04:59:21,540 --> 04:59:24,659
My men were horrified and ran away, but by that time I did not care.

1262
04:59:25,619 --> 04:59:30,180
Asura ran onward and encountered more Shinkoku soldiers and Goma,

1263
04:59:30,180 --> 04:59:32,180
which he ripped to shreds in an instant.

1264
04:59:32,900 --> 04:59:37,060
Interestingly enough, he had no eyes for civilian demigods or humans,

1265
04:59:37,060 --> 04:59:37,860
and left them alone.

1266
04:59:38,900 --> 04:59:41,540
At that moment, Asura is headed toward the area

1267
04:59:41,540 --> 04:59:44,659
where Lord Serjay and Lord Yasha are conducting a purification.

1268
04:59:46,099 --> 04:59:48,020
What is he? What is he trying to do?

1269
04:59:49,639 --> 04:59:51,959
Sound of his ferocious cry still rings in my ears.

1270
04:59:51,959 --> 04:59:53,400
I must know what it all means.

1271
04:59:54,200 --> 04:59:54,700
Okay.

1272
04:59:56,860 --> 04:59:59,220
He's doing Obama.

1273
04:59:59,220 --> 05:00:00,349
Was I?

1274
05:00:05,990 --> 05:00:06,490
Loss.

1275
05:00:13,560 --> 05:00:14,060
Now what?

1276
05:00:14,840 --> 05:00:23,509
So this guy, this guy turned out to be kind of a chump, huh?

1277
05:00:23,509 --> 05:00:32,759
Wait, am I making, am I doing it right?

1278
05:00:32,759 --> 05:00:34,919
I thought it was like puppeting him.

1279
05:00:44,860 --> 05:00:50,759
Is this a Gatorade commercial?

1280
05:01:20,840 --> 05:01:22,680
Just let him like stand on the ground?

1281
05:01:22,680 --> 05:01:23,319
This is weird.

1282
05:01:24,680 --> 05:01:26,119
His feet are just dangling.

1283
05:01:26,119 --> 05:01:26,619
This is odd.

1284
05:01:26,619 --> 05:01:27,119
God.

1285
05:01:58,970 --> 05:01:59,930
Joker audition?

1286
05:02:03,799 --> 05:02:04,680
Kill Jester.

1287
05:02:04,680 --> 05:02:05,479
Kill Jester.

1288
05:02:27,099 --> 05:02:28,779
Why am I holding his head?

1289
05:02:28,779 --> 05:02:29,819
Can't they just talk?

1290
05:02:29,819 --> 05:02:30,619
Ah, this is weird.

1291
05:02:35,919 --> 05:02:41,639
I'm just Venom.

1292
05:02:48,119 --> 05:02:54,750
Head Squish.

1293
05:02:54,750 --> 05:02:55,549
We're gonna get another one.

1294
05:02:56,430 --> 05:02:57,950
I knew we were gonna get another one.

1295
05:02:57,950 --> 05:02:58,450
I knew it.

1296
05:02:59,630 --> 05:03:00,509
This was a matter of time.

1297
05:03:07,479 --> 05:03:12,680
If we get the hat trick on Head Squish's, you owe me a soda.

1298
05:03:12,680 --> 05:03:21,180
What's, okay, what's with this in anime?

1299
05:03:21,180 --> 05:03:21,740
Somebody help me here.

1300
05:03:23,979 --> 05:03:25,180
Everyone always does this.

1301
05:03:25,180 --> 05:03:28,619
They lean, they lean forward like this.

1302
05:03:28,619 --> 05:03:31,340
And they like lean forward and they go like this and their arm is up like this.

1303
05:03:32,220 --> 05:03:52,319
The game started so I have to, oh I have to, I'm playing games myself?

1304
05:03:53,439 --> 05:03:57,680
See, look, he's doing the, he's doing the like I've gone crazy anime stance.

1305
05:03:58,880 --> 05:04:00,810
That happens in every anime.

1306
05:04:01,529 --> 05:04:02,209
Watch.

1307
05:04:20,200 --> 05:04:22,439
Because I've, because I've seen like 10 of them.

1308
05:04:23,720 --> 05:04:35,119
Give me a second.

1309
05:04:35,919 --> 05:04:37,040
What the fuck are you doing?

1310
05:04:38,720 --> 05:04:46,159
Stay with him, stay with him, stay with him, stay with him, stay with him.

1311
05:04:47,680 --> 05:04:56,889
Good, I got some good hits on that one.

1312
05:04:57,770 --> 05:05:19,529
Watch out!

1313
05:05:19,529 --> 05:05:34,669
By one hit, by one fucking hit move thing.

1314
05:05:34,669 --> 05:05:35,169
What?

1315
05:05:59,630 --> 05:06:08,520
Thousand miles per hour.

1316
05:06:17,790 --> 05:06:19,520
Got it.

1317
05:06:19,520 --> 05:06:26,169
Hi, everybody.

1318
05:06:26,169 --> 05:06:27,770
Sorry for doing the ayaya.

1319
05:06:28,810 --> 05:06:34,060
Apologize every day.

1320
05:06:34,060 --> 05:06:35,659
Apologize every day.

1321
05:06:36,700 --> 05:06:41,900
Now, it would be cool if we changed sides, right?

1322
05:06:41,900 --> 05:06:44,939
If they flipped it and now I control, that would be really cool.

1323
05:07:09,500 --> 05:07:10,380
Shit, I missed it.

1324
05:07:14,959 --> 05:07:16,319
That's supposed to happen.

1325
05:07:16,319 --> 05:07:17,520
I think that's supposed to happen.

1326
05:07:18,400 --> 05:07:19,200
I forgot.

1327
05:07:19,200 --> 05:07:20,000
It's supposed to happen.

1328
05:07:20,799 --> 05:07:22,479
Still the same Asura.

1329
05:07:25,950 --> 05:07:27,069
Listen to anyone.

1330
05:07:29,020 --> 05:07:29,900
All right, there's the real.

1331
05:07:36,360 --> 05:07:44,029
Did it work?

1332
05:07:44,029 --> 05:07:47,549
I just ran an ad, I just ran ads.

1333
05:07:48,349 --> 05:07:54,459
It didn't work.

1334
05:07:57,040 --> 05:08:00,560
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1335
05:08:01,840 --> 05:08:03,470
No one's gonna get any.

1336
05:08:04,509 --> 05:08:07,470
I swear to God, my ad profile is ShadowBand on Twitch.

1337
05:08:08,029 --> 05:08:08,830
I really think it is.

1338
05:08:09,630 --> 05:08:17,069
Hold on, let's see.

1339
05:08:17,790 --> 05:08:18,430
15 seconds.

1340
05:08:19,389 --> 05:08:22,700
Hold on, let's see.

1341
05:08:23,819 --> 05:08:28,840
Okay, hold on, here they come.

1342
05:08:29,880 --> 05:08:36,000
Asura's Wrath.

1343
05:08:36,000 --> 05:08:48,860
How's, did you guys see it?

1344
05:08:48,860 --> 05:08:50,139
You guys gonna have, how's the ad break?

1345
05:08:50,860 --> 05:08:54,240
I got an ad on my phone.

1346
05:08:54,240 --> 05:08:54,880
Oh.

1347
05:08:54,880 --> 05:09:02,919
Is this game vegan?

1348
05:09:02,919 --> 05:09:03,419
Yeah.

1349
05:09:03,959 --> 05:09:06,750
Okay.

1350
05:09:07,369 --> 05:09:14,490
Dude, I don't even know if it's fucking moving.

1351
05:09:27,610 --> 05:09:28,330
Whoa.

1352
05:09:28,330 --> 05:09:31,470
He just fell down.

1353
05:09:31,470 --> 05:09:32,110
He failed the QTE.

1354
05:09:32,669 --> 05:09:33,169
Good.

1355
05:09:33,549 --> 05:09:34,409
Good for us.

1356
05:09:35,450 --> 05:09:57,450
Ah, shit.

1357
05:09:57,450 --> 05:09:58,169
How did I miss that?

1358
05:09:58,810 --> 05:10:05,759
He didn't even put, you see, he put his hand down.

1359
05:10:05,759 --> 05:10:06,479
He didn't even swing.

1360
05:10:07,610 --> 05:10:08,569
He didn't even swing.

1361
05:10:08,569 --> 05:10:09,770
He, he swung after I died.

1362
05:10:10,409 --> 05:10:19,099
His build meter.

1363
05:10:34,200 --> 05:10:36,090
Who the hell am I?

1364
05:10:36,090 --> 05:10:39,340
What the fuck is going on?

1365
05:10:39,340 --> 05:10:40,139
I'm moving too fast.

1366
05:10:40,139 --> 05:10:41,020
I can't even see what I'm doing.

1367
05:10:41,659 --> 05:10:42,299
Who the hell am I?

1368
05:10:43,360 --> 05:10:43,860
What?

1369
05:10:46,669 --> 05:10:47,169
Hello?

1370
05:10:49,259 --> 05:10:50,380
Moving too fast.

1371
05:10:51,180 --> 05:11:02,840
I was moving way too fast.

1372
05:11:02,840 --> 05:11:14,880
Oh, man.

1373
05:11:14,880 --> 05:11:16,880
He fucking killed me.

1374
05:11:18,000 --> 05:11:19,020
Okay.

1375
05:11:19,020 --> 05:11:19,900
I was going too fast.

1376
05:11:19,900 --> 05:11:21,419
I gotta, that's just all super speed.

1377
05:11:22,619 --> 05:11:23,659
All right, let's go.

1378
05:11:23,659 --> 05:11:31,209
I thought, for some reason,

1379
05:11:31,209 --> 05:11:32,330
I thought they could walk around it somehow.

1380
05:11:32,330 --> 05:11:41,529
Get this jacket off.

1381
05:11:42,490 --> 05:11:44,409
I'm getting a goddamn wedding over here.

1382
05:12:27,439 --> 05:12:28,240
Come here.

1383
05:12:28,240 --> 05:12:30,750
Jesus, too fast did I go.

1384
05:12:34,240 --> 05:12:35,360
You move so fast.

1385
05:12:35,360 --> 05:12:37,119
God damn, this is gonna be hard.

1386
05:12:37,119 --> 05:12:38,159
This is the hardest fight so far.

1387
05:12:39,680 --> 05:12:44,400
God, sometimes he doesn't do it.

1388
05:12:44,400 --> 05:12:44,959
Just kill me.

1389
05:12:44,959 --> 05:12:45,439
Just kill me.

1390
05:12:45,439 --> 05:12:45,919
Kill me.

1391
05:12:45,919 --> 05:12:46,720
Kill me.

1392
05:12:46,720 --> 05:12:47,220
Kill me.

1393
05:12:48,560 --> 05:12:55,159
Kill me.

1394
05:12:55,159 --> 05:13:05,150
We have a pee break?

1395
05:13:05,150 --> 05:13:05,709
I need to pee.

1396
05:13:06,590 --> 05:13:07,790
After this mission, we'll do a pee break.

1397
05:13:12,400 --> 05:13:23,919
Finally, he falls down and dash.

1398
05:13:24,799 --> 05:13:29,880
Same deal.

1399
05:13:30,680 --> 05:13:31,240
Getting close.

1400
05:13:32,040 --> 05:13:34,540
Back up.

1401
05:13:45,659 --> 05:13:46,759
Come on.

1402
05:13:46,759 --> 05:13:47,080
Do it.

1403
05:13:47,080 --> 05:13:47,400
Dash.

1404
05:13:47,959 --> 05:13:53,610
Here goes.

1405
05:14:10,860 --> 05:14:11,419
Damn it.

1406
05:14:11,419 --> 05:14:12,380
I thought he was dashing.

1407
05:14:13,020 --> 05:14:13,419
All right.

1408
05:14:13,419 --> 05:14:14,220
Didn't take much damage.

1409
05:14:17,360 --> 05:14:17,680
Fuck.

1410
05:14:17,680 --> 05:14:18,240
I thought he was...

1411
05:14:19,520 --> 05:14:20,240
That's so annoying.

1412
05:14:20,240 --> 05:14:20,400
Fuck.

1413
05:14:20,400 --> 05:14:21,520
I thought he was doing the whole thing.

1414
05:14:22,400 --> 05:14:38,110
All right.

1415
05:14:38,110 --> 05:14:39,389
Don't use the speed unless I need it.

1416
05:14:40,430 --> 05:15:09,529
All right.

1417
05:15:09,529 --> 05:15:10,810
Only one more.

1418
05:15:10,810 --> 05:15:11,369
That should be it.

1419
05:15:12,090 --> 05:15:14,490
More good one.

1420
05:15:21,099 --> 05:15:25,099
This should be it.

1421
05:15:26,619 --> 05:15:27,020
Come on.

1422
05:15:27,979 --> 05:15:30,040
Come on.

1423
05:15:30,040 --> 05:15:30,680
Ah.

1424
05:15:30,680 --> 05:15:31,720
Needs like one more.

1425
05:16:08,759 --> 05:16:09,080
Good.

1426
05:16:09,639 --> 05:16:12,459
I'm losing frames here.

1427
05:16:12,459 --> 05:16:13,500
It doesn't count.

1428
05:16:13,500 --> 05:16:15,740
We're at like 14 frames a second.

1429
05:16:16,380 --> 05:16:24,080
All right.

1430
05:16:24,080 --> 05:16:34,909
Did I win?

1431
05:16:35,630 --> 05:16:51,119
Is the QTE the same button?

1432
05:16:53,310 --> 05:16:54,270
It's usually Y.

1433
05:16:54,909 --> 05:16:55,150
Yeah.

1434
05:16:56,270 --> 05:17:05,639
I hope he keeps devolving.

1435
05:17:07,919 --> 05:17:08,319
Yeah.

1436
05:17:08,319 --> 05:17:08,560
Okay.

1437
05:17:08,560 --> 05:17:10,000
Are we going to get another form?

1438
05:17:10,720 --> 05:17:13,599
Can he just be like a puddle of mud or something with like two fingers?

1439
05:17:17,869 --> 05:17:21,229
I should dispose of him where he stands.

1440
05:17:22,189 --> 05:17:24,430
My soul tells me different.

1441
05:17:27,610 --> 05:17:28,970
Screams to me.

1442
05:17:28,970 --> 05:17:30,250
He's too angry to die.

1443
05:17:31,130 --> 05:17:32,009
Let him die.

1444
05:17:33,950 --> 05:17:44,279
For a reason.

1445
05:17:44,279 --> 05:17:45,639
Then listen to my fists.

1446
05:17:52,159 --> 05:17:53,200
How many times are we going to do that?

1447
05:17:54,479 --> 05:17:57,680
You'd think you'd punch with the other hand by now.

1448
05:18:05,529 --> 05:18:06,409
Civil War.

1449
05:18:10,119 --> 05:18:12,200
That really was Civil War.

1450
05:18:12,279 --> 05:18:14,799
I have business in Shinto.

1451
05:18:16,840 --> 05:18:17,720
Why is it normal now?

1452
05:18:19,369 --> 05:18:20,729
Wait for my return.

1453
05:18:36,110 --> 05:18:37,229
Dead for the fourth time.

1454
05:18:37,229 --> 05:18:41,659
Number four.

1455
05:18:41,659 --> 05:18:44,060
Hope we appear back on that pillar to climb.

1456
05:18:44,700 --> 05:18:46,860
I am Yasha of the Seven Deities.

1457
05:18:53,560 --> 05:18:54,119
Corvette.

1458
05:19:23,400 --> 05:19:24,520
There's a 15.

1459
05:19:24,520 --> 05:19:28,360
Two more episodes remain until we get the final story.

1460
05:19:28,919 --> 05:19:52,220
Comes episode 16.

1461
05:19:52,220 --> 05:19:52,540
Oh look.

1462
05:19:52,540 --> 05:19:54,060
It's Jerma's grade in college.

1463
05:19:55,020 --> 05:19:59,240
I don't remember that.

1464
05:19:59,240 --> 05:20:02,400
It said P-break.

1465
05:20:02,400 --> 05:20:02,720
Yeah.

1466
05:20:02,720 --> 05:20:03,439
No, don't worry.

1467
05:20:03,919 --> 05:20:04,400
We will.

1468
05:20:05,549 --> 05:20:07,790
Thousands of years ago in Deus's office.

1469
05:20:08,750 --> 05:20:09,869
Yasha, we decided.

1470
05:20:11,389 --> 05:20:12,189
Why are you so hesitant?

1471
05:20:12,189 --> 05:20:14,349
It's the only way we can save this accursed planet.

1472
05:20:14,349 --> 05:20:18,029
But to kill a few to save the many, I do not feel that would be just.

1473
05:20:18,029 --> 05:20:19,229
This has nothing to do with justice.

1474
05:20:19,229 --> 05:20:20,029
It is our cause.

1475
05:20:20,830 --> 05:20:22,029
What do you mean saving our way of life?

1476
05:20:22,029 --> 05:20:23,549
I would gladly accept becoming a demon.

1477
05:20:24,430 --> 05:20:27,900
That's what it takes to attain an eternity of peace and prosperity for our people.

1478
05:20:28,619 --> 05:20:35,069
A village with no name.

1479
05:20:36,360 --> 05:20:37,240
Great guardian.

1480
05:20:37,240 --> 05:20:38,520
Why do the Goma exist?

1481
05:20:38,520 --> 05:20:40,119
Why do they come and take everything from us?

1482
05:20:40,759 --> 05:20:43,959
Well, my lord, my son's death was not in vain, was it?

1483
05:20:43,959 --> 05:20:44,680
No, it was not.

1484
05:20:44,680 --> 05:20:46,520
We would have been powerless without his prayers.

1485
05:20:47,240 --> 05:20:48,080
I see.

1486
05:20:48,080 --> 05:20:50,240
Thank goodness, son, your death was not in vain.

1487
05:20:51,040 --> 05:20:53,200
But I wish you could have lived to see a world of peace.

1488
05:20:53,200 --> 05:20:56,000
Let us meet again one day when you are reborn in a different life.

1489
05:20:56,959 --> 05:21:04,669
It is his office.

1490
05:21:05,389 --> 05:21:09,080
Well, I've seen so much pain and suffering of our people throughout this internal war.

1491
05:21:09,080 --> 05:21:11,639
If you say we can stop this, then I am at your command.

1492
05:21:11,639 --> 05:21:12,919
I too shall become a demon.

1493
05:21:13,720 --> 05:21:14,779
You made the right choice.

1494
05:21:14,779 --> 05:21:16,540
I'm confident you will make me very proud.

1495
05:21:17,259 --> 05:21:20,139
From this day forth, I shall live only for the cause.

1496
05:21:21,020 --> 05:21:24,360
Until I fly away in a corvette.

1497
05:21:26,110 --> 05:21:26,830
All right, pee break.

1498
05:21:27,470 --> 05:21:28,669
And then we'll get into the end here.

1499
05:21:31,639 --> 05:23:46,590
All right.

1500
05:23:46,590 --> 05:23:50,189
I don't know if this is gonna sound weird, Mike, but my room smells like chocolate.

1501
05:23:51,389 --> 05:23:53,439
For some reason.

1502
05:23:53,439 --> 05:23:55,500
It smells like chocolate in here.

1503
05:24:21,099 --> 05:24:22,139
Will we be back here again?

1504
05:24:28,759 --> 05:24:44,799
We the seven deities have finally brought stability and all this anger inside of me.

1505
05:24:45,599 --> 05:24:47,040
I don't fight for good.

1506
05:24:48,080 --> 05:24:49,439
And I don't fight for evil.

1507
05:24:50,240 --> 05:24:51,439
I just fight.

1508
05:24:51,439 --> 05:24:53,119
I will say it once more.

1509
05:24:54,400 --> 05:24:56,959
I am you and you are me.

1510
05:25:02,509 --> 05:25:04,189
I'm leaning back in my chair right now.

1511
05:25:06,990 --> 05:25:07,869
Take a look at this.

1512
05:25:07,950 --> 05:25:09,790
This is a new new mic sound, right?

1513
05:25:10,349 --> 05:25:11,310
Yes.

1514
05:25:11,310 --> 05:25:14,509
The source of your power is your fan.

1515
05:25:14,509 --> 05:25:18,669
If you're so powerful, it could scorch your very body.

1516
05:25:18,669 --> 05:25:23,159
Unleash your rage and let your arm do the rest.

1517
05:25:23,159 --> 05:25:23,900
Yes.

1518
05:25:25,000 --> 05:25:34,139
Give in to the fear.

1519
05:25:34,139 --> 05:25:34,779
Spider.

1520
05:25:34,779 --> 05:25:37,580
I will lose myself again.

1521
05:25:37,580 --> 05:25:38,220
Spider.

1522
05:25:38,220 --> 05:25:42,540
You have extraordinary power, sir.

1523
05:25:42,540 --> 05:25:44,939
It's the power that cannot protect anything.

1524
05:25:44,939 --> 05:25:46,299
He's giving birth.

1525
05:25:47,610 --> 05:25:48,250
Yes, it can.

1526
05:25:49,049 --> 05:25:51,130
It can save the world.

1527
05:25:52,330 --> 05:25:53,849
Save the world.

1528
05:25:53,849 --> 05:25:57,959
This power is ridiculous.

1529
05:25:57,959 --> 05:25:58,459
Oh.

1530
05:26:06,680 --> 05:26:07,180
All right.

1531
05:26:12,319 --> 05:26:30,849
Okay.

1532
05:26:31,310 --> 05:26:33,069
You just have to go over there.

1533
05:26:35,659 --> 05:26:37,979
Exact same thing happens in the Fall Metal Alchemist intro.

1534
05:26:37,979 --> 05:26:41,340
I will let you take any more lives.

1535
05:26:41,340 --> 05:26:42,380
Exact same thing.

1536
05:26:43,099 --> 05:26:52,430
How would you know?

1537
05:26:52,430 --> 05:26:53,069
Because I've seen it.

1538
05:26:53,709 --> 05:27:03,900
I swear to God, watching anime for some of you guys is the equivalent

1539
05:27:03,900 --> 05:27:06,939
of me like snorting coke before I scream.

1540
05:27:07,580 --> 05:27:07,979
But you...

1541
05:27:08,939 --> 05:27:09,740
Did you get that?

1542
05:27:11,610 --> 05:27:12,409
Should you have done that?

1543
05:27:16,939 --> 05:27:19,020
Snorting anime before the stream turns on.

1544
05:27:21,849 --> 05:27:24,779
Snap, I've seen a couple, but it's not a big deal.

1545
05:27:48,860 --> 05:27:49,580
Look, they'll scream.

1546
05:27:50,779 --> 05:28:00,060
Oh, that was right in the face.

1547
05:28:01,259 --> 05:28:09,639
Come on.

1548
05:28:09,639 --> 05:28:14,520
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

1549
05:28:14,520 --> 05:28:15,560
Walk onto him.

1550
05:28:15,560 --> 05:28:16,759
Why would you walk onto that guy?

1551
05:28:17,400 --> 05:28:19,080
Why would you walk onto the guy back here?

1552
05:28:19,959 --> 05:28:21,080
What do you think of him?

1553
05:28:21,159 --> 05:28:22,599
Why would you do something like that?

1554
05:28:36,060 --> 05:28:36,380
More?

1555
05:28:36,939 --> 05:28:38,939
Ooh, that daggers it up.

1556
05:28:39,979 --> 05:28:41,020
I actually have to sit up.

1557
05:28:56,990 --> 05:29:00,650
Come on again.

1558
05:29:01,290 --> 05:29:10,430
Thanks for the help.

1559
05:29:13,610 --> 05:29:17,119
Oh, this area sucks.

1560
05:29:27,849 --> 05:29:30,889
Ah, yai.

1561
05:29:30,889 --> 05:29:32,759
This place sucks.

1562
05:29:46,009 --> 05:29:47,130
I'm not even going to walk onto him.

1563
05:29:47,130 --> 05:29:49,770
Stop telling me in the story I was going right at the beginning of the stream.

1564
05:29:51,770 --> 05:29:52,729
It just rips around.

1565
05:29:53,689 --> 05:29:58,840
Now I walk onto him.

1566
05:29:58,840 --> 05:29:59,159
No.

1567
05:29:59,159 --> 05:30:00,599
What the fuck are you doing?

1568
05:30:01,720 --> 05:30:05,900
Hey, you know the guy that's in front of me?

1569
05:30:11,659 --> 05:30:15,549
Just kill me.

1570
05:30:15,549 --> 05:30:16,349
Just fucking kill me.

1571
05:30:22,959 --> 05:30:24,560
This has to last like five waves.

1572
05:30:26,759 --> 05:30:38,250
Because that guy can't believe he just got a kill.

1573
05:30:38,250 --> 05:30:40,919
Oh my god, I actually did it.

1574
05:30:41,560 --> 05:30:43,639
I shot my little fucking peepee gun at him.

1575
05:30:43,639 --> 05:30:45,159
Whoa, he died from that.

1576
05:30:45,159 --> 05:30:46,119
That's unbelievable.

1577
05:30:46,860 --> 05:30:48,220
Never happened before, ever to me.

1578
05:31:06,189 --> 05:31:08,110
How do- you gotta be fucking kidding me.

1579
05:31:09,069 --> 05:31:10,590
You gotta be kidding me.

1580
05:31:10,590 --> 05:31:11,470
Get out of here.

1581
05:31:12,270 --> 05:31:20,299
I'm gonna fucking smash the Xbox.

1582
05:31:22,599 --> 05:31:33,869
I'm gonna hit him in the ear.

1583
05:32:18,400 --> 05:32:19,520
I'm fucking dead.

1584
05:32:27,610 --> 05:32:28,810
This is unbelievable.

1585
05:32:28,810 --> 05:32:51,069
All right, here comes the worst part.

1586
05:32:51,069 --> 05:32:52,110
This is gonna be the worst part.

1587
05:32:53,240 --> 05:32:53,720
Use burst?

1588
05:32:53,720 --> 05:32:54,200
I don't have it.

1589
05:32:57,400 --> 05:32:58,680
Burst is the way to beat the level.

1590
05:32:59,319 --> 05:33:01,630
All right, I gotta clear out the little guys first.

1591
05:33:40,330 --> 05:33:54,720
Hi.

1592
05:33:55,439 --> 05:33:56,479
Hey, let's fight now, please.

1593
05:33:57,520 --> 05:33:58,560
I'd love to-

1594
05:34:00,080 --> 05:34:04,590
Stop pretending.

1595
05:34:04,590 --> 05:34:06,830
Dude, I gotta fucking pretend for views, man.

1596
05:34:07,709 --> 05:34:08,189
Come on.

1597
05:34:08,189 --> 05:34:08,750
What are you doing?

1598
05:34:08,750 --> 05:34:09,069
Get it?

1599
05:34:11,580 --> 05:34:12,220
I've got to.

1600
05:34:13,659 --> 05:34:19,439
How are people gonna watch if I don't get hit three times and die by 10 people surrounding me

1601
05:34:20,159 --> 05:34:30,729
without a block?

1602
05:34:51,259 --> 05:34:52,939
Imagine blocking in an action game.

1603
05:34:53,580 --> 05:34:58,380
It's just stuff with 10 people on the screen around you in a circle and the lock-on sucks.

1604
05:34:59,259 --> 05:35:01,580
All right, just do it again, do it again, do it again.

1605
05:35:03,020 --> 05:35:12,250
The best part about playing an action game,

1606
05:35:12,250 --> 05:35:16,250
when you fucking stand still and nobody will touch you,

1607
05:35:16,250 --> 05:35:18,970
it's like they know that you're not moving around.

1608
05:35:18,970 --> 05:35:21,049
No one's even trying to hurt me right now.

1609
05:35:21,049 --> 05:35:21,849
Why does this happen?

1610
05:35:23,659 --> 05:35:25,500
Well, I've decided I will attack you now.

1611
05:35:27,340 --> 05:35:30,299
I waited 15 full seconds to do anything.

1612
05:35:33,150 --> 05:35:35,069
When you actually are trying to beat the game,

1613
05:35:36,729 --> 05:35:45,849
I've turned it on times a thousand.

1614
05:35:45,849 --> 05:35:48,090
Jack isn't doing anything, like this is on target.

1615
05:35:48,090 --> 05:35:48,810
Just fucking kill me.

1616
05:36:00,799 --> 05:36:02,080
I was gonna say you almost missed.

1617
05:36:04,400 --> 05:36:06,319
He's mauling at a cutscene game.

1618
05:36:09,340 --> 05:36:10,700
All right, this is the one, this is the one,

1619
05:36:10,700 --> 05:36:11,500
this is the one, this is the one.

1620
05:36:12,619 --> 05:36:14,619
But I didn't even have time to react.

1621
05:36:14,619 --> 05:36:19,639
I'm stupid, I'm stupid.

1622
05:36:33,389 --> 05:36:34,909
What the fuck are you doing?

1623
05:36:40,639 --> 05:36:41,520
What the fuck?

1624
05:36:42,909 --> 05:36:53,770
I'm not walking onto anybody, I can't.

1625
05:37:20,889 --> 05:37:24,330
No, that's not the guy I wanted to walk onto.

1626
05:37:25,290 --> 05:37:28,810
What, who do you think I was trying to target?

1627
05:37:30,330 --> 05:37:34,090
It's not the person I was trying to target.

1628
05:37:35,130 --> 05:37:36,650
I'm glad he's dead anyways.

1629
05:38:00,680 --> 05:38:03,720
Fuck man, these guys still behind me.

1630
05:38:03,720 --> 05:38:04,840
Where did he even come from?

1631
05:38:06,680 --> 05:38:13,180
All right, I can make this count.

1632
05:38:38,330 --> 05:38:40,490
What the fuck is happening right now?

1633
05:38:40,490 --> 05:38:47,979
I can't, these people are fucking freaking me out.

1634
05:38:50,159 --> 05:38:51,200
Jesus Christ.

1635
05:39:03,950 --> 05:39:04,430
No, don't.

1636
05:39:15,720 --> 05:39:23,000
Do something, do something, do something, do something.

1637
05:39:40,439 --> 05:39:40,919
Thank God.

1638
05:39:58,759 --> 05:40:03,069
Back up, back up, back up, back up, back up, back up.

1639
05:40:03,069 --> 05:40:03,869
I got a fucking idea.

1640
05:40:03,869 --> 05:40:04,909
Here's my idea, this is it.

1641
05:40:04,909 --> 05:40:07,709
I'm fine.

1642
05:40:19,150 --> 05:40:19,389
Dead?

1643
05:40:25,259 --> 05:40:27,450
That was horrible.

1644
05:40:28,090 --> 05:40:28,810
That was painful.

1645
05:40:29,369 --> 05:40:30,409
That hurt.

1646
05:40:30,409 --> 05:40:33,209
It was a quality tuber noises.

1647
05:40:33,209 --> 05:40:33,849
Yeah, I know, dude.

1648
05:40:33,849 --> 05:40:35,450
Imagine that in a fucking compilation.

1649
05:40:47,659 --> 05:40:49,500
No, it's probably gonna get harder.

1650
05:41:30,779 --> 05:41:31,580
All right.

1651
05:41:33,900 --> 05:41:36,139
Good, get me out, get me out.

1652
05:41:36,779 --> 05:41:37,340
How do I get out?

1653
05:41:38,060 --> 05:41:42,889
What's going on?

1654
05:41:46,509 --> 05:41:47,549
This guy's fucking up the door.

1655
05:41:56,360 --> 05:41:57,880
Okay, let's go.

1656
05:42:01,659 --> 05:42:04,299
This just got, this game just got like 5,000 times harder.

1657
05:42:30,720 --> 05:42:31,360
It's a good grab.

1658
05:42:38,240 --> 05:43:02,830
Great, he's getting angry again.

1659
05:43:04,430 --> 05:43:08,619
Last time he did was he turned into a goblin.

1660
05:43:09,819 --> 05:43:25,770
I don't get it, but he's connected to the girl so I can't kill him.

1661
05:43:26,330 --> 05:43:31,340
It's one of those slime hands you get as a kid.

1662
05:43:32,060 --> 05:43:34,619
From like the 50 cent machine, the little gumball machine.

1663
05:43:36,779 --> 05:43:39,020
That was a sick stock electricity sound.

1664
05:43:39,020 --> 05:43:39,900
I can probably find that right now.

1665
05:43:41,419 --> 05:43:49,770
What's that for?

1666
05:43:52,000 --> 05:43:52,639
It's mine.

1667
05:43:55,639 --> 05:43:57,000
Stay out of my way.

1668
05:44:00,200 --> 05:44:06,200
You want to fight?

1669
05:44:06,200 --> 05:44:06,680
No, I got it.

1670
05:44:15,740 --> 05:44:18,139
It's required to save the world.

1671
05:44:18,139 --> 05:44:20,029
Are we gonna do two on one here?

1672
05:44:20,029 --> 05:44:27,639
I will show you how useless that cure is.

1673
05:44:27,639 --> 05:44:28,139
Let's go.

1674
05:44:29,000 --> 05:44:36,479
But blinded by your own bringing salvation to guide.

1675
05:44:36,479 --> 05:44:38,080
It becomes a triple threat match.

1676
05:44:39,040 --> 05:44:45,099
I'm gonna save the world.

1677
05:44:45,099 --> 05:44:54,810
This hell will finally end.

1678
05:44:54,810 --> 05:44:59,369
I'm powering up too close.

1679
05:45:07,259 --> 05:45:08,060
How many arms do I get?

1680
05:45:09,580 --> 05:45:10,860
Do I get more than six?

1681
05:45:34,200 --> 05:45:38,830
Watch out for the electricity.

1682
05:45:39,950 --> 05:45:40,909
Shitload of electricity.

1683
05:45:41,790 --> 05:45:44,029
Drive iframes.

1684
05:45:47,759 --> 05:45:56,880
Go, go, go, double team.

1685
05:46:01,020 --> 05:46:01,520
Ow, fuck.

1686
05:46:07,389 --> 05:46:07,889
Nice.

1687
05:46:09,229 --> 05:46:10,830
Hey, I'm walking far away.

1688
05:46:15,799 --> 05:46:17,240
That's what I like to see, the good double.

1689
05:46:18,200 --> 05:46:19,799
We will shoot at the same time.

1690
05:46:23,369 --> 05:46:24,090
Oh, shit.

1691
05:46:25,610 --> 05:46:27,930
I don't have any power.

1692
05:46:27,930 --> 05:46:29,130
All right, I gotta be careful here.

1693
05:46:44,349 --> 05:46:49,119
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, hurry, hurry.

1694
05:46:54,919 --> 05:46:55,959
Hey, hey, huh?

1695
05:46:56,599 --> 05:46:57,240
What was that?

1696
05:46:58,569 --> 05:46:59,610
Okay, wait a minute.

1697
05:46:59,610 --> 05:47:02,250
That didn't, I didn't even get a tenth of a second to do that last one.

1698
05:47:05,279 --> 05:47:05,779
Bullshit.

1699
05:47:06,400 --> 05:47:32,299
All right, get in there, let's go.

1700
05:47:32,939 --> 05:47:33,740
Start attacking them.

1701
05:47:34,459 --> 05:47:36,939
Get in there.

1702
05:47:58,750 --> 05:47:59,630
All right, what was there?

1703
05:48:04,840 --> 05:48:05,340
Shit.

1704
05:48:05,959 --> 05:48:06,599
Oh, shit.

1705
05:48:08,110 --> 05:48:08,669
Oh, shit.

1706
05:48:09,470 --> 05:48:11,150
Oh, no.

1707
05:48:11,150 --> 05:48:12,830
Oh, I just had it off timing.

1708
05:48:12,830 --> 05:48:15,900
Ah, I had it off timed.

1709
05:48:16,540 --> 05:48:17,959
All right, I know what he does now.

1710
05:48:41,020 --> 05:48:41,819
When you get close enough,

1711
05:48:41,819 --> 05:48:42,860
you're gonna be fucking careful.

1712
05:48:42,860 --> 05:48:46,560
He does that shit.

1713
05:48:47,200 --> 05:48:48,959
Oh, come on.

1714
05:48:48,959 --> 05:48:50,240
I thought I was out of the range.

1715
05:48:50,240 --> 05:48:51,040
Give me a break, game.

1716
05:48:57,259 --> 05:48:57,900
Get in here.

1717
05:48:59,099 --> 05:49:01,040
This dude isn't doing anything.

1718
05:49:01,040 --> 05:49:02,159
He usually helps.

1719
05:49:02,159 --> 05:49:03,740
Not this time, apparently.

1720
05:49:12,729 --> 05:49:14,569
The other dude didn't do shit this time.

1721
05:49:15,130 --> 05:49:16,650
He just, he's supposed to help me.

1722
05:49:17,450 --> 05:49:40,560
He just has to act to every sound.

1723
05:49:40,560 --> 05:49:42,000
My god, Jesus.

1724
05:49:43,759 --> 05:49:59,099
Good job.

1725
05:49:59,099 --> 05:50:00,139
Good job, you keep missing.

1726
05:50:01,020 --> 05:50:16,720
He has to do the big stomp thing.

1727
05:50:32,409 --> 05:50:33,209
What the fuck?

1728
05:50:37,709 --> 05:50:45,639
Why do the cameras grip around like that?

1729
05:50:45,639 --> 05:50:46,139
Okay.

1730
05:50:52,779 --> 05:50:53,819
This camera's giving me a headache.

1731
05:50:54,540 --> 05:50:58,759
I'm not even locked onto him.

1732
05:50:58,759 --> 05:51:00,119
We're just like ripping around

1733
05:51:00,119 --> 05:51:01,159
when he dashes forward.

1734
05:51:13,240 --> 05:51:15,159
Yeah, it's two guys versus a fucking hacker.

1735
05:51:15,880 --> 05:51:35,150
He goes that far?

1736
05:51:35,150 --> 05:51:37,549
I thought it didn't go that far.

1737
05:51:37,549 --> 05:51:38,830
I can't even, man.

1738
05:51:50,799 --> 05:51:51,299
Please.

1739
05:51:52,159 --> 05:51:53,919
He's giving me fucking diarrhea.

1740
05:51:56,830 --> 05:52:03,000
All right, I think I got it for free.

1741
05:52:05,080 --> 05:52:14,840
This is too much stimulation right now.

1742
05:52:31,790 --> 05:52:32,669
Fuck this guy.

1743
05:52:33,389 --> 05:52:37,659
It's just flashing lights.

1744
05:52:40,729 --> 05:52:41,930
Get out of here, please.

1745
05:52:41,930 --> 05:52:42,650
Just kill him.

1746
05:52:42,650 --> 05:52:43,529
Help me fight him.

1747
05:52:46,799 --> 05:52:47,919
Thanks a lot, idiot.

1748
05:52:47,919 --> 05:52:48,880
He just ruined it.

1749
05:52:48,880 --> 05:52:50,080
I was doing my move here.

1750
05:52:56,959 --> 05:52:58,560
As he just squints the boss fight.

1751
05:53:00,720 --> 05:53:19,450
I jumped.

1752
05:53:19,450 --> 05:53:20,330
I jumped.

1753
05:53:20,330 --> 05:53:20,729
I jumped.

1754
05:53:20,729 --> 05:53:21,209
What happened?

1755
05:53:25,180 --> 05:53:25,680
What?

1756
05:53:26,540 --> 05:53:27,580
I jumped over that.

1757
05:53:32,799 --> 05:53:35,950
And this guy has a run of fucking mana.

1758
05:53:36,590 --> 05:53:37,549
This is bullshit.

1759
05:53:59,419 --> 05:54:00,459
Where is he?

1760
05:54:00,459 --> 05:54:01,099
Come on.

1761
05:54:01,099 --> 05:54:01,819
We're almost there.

1762
05:54:03,880 --> 05:54:04,759
You and me.

1763
05:54:04,759 --> 05:54:16,270
We call him again.

1764
05:54:16,270 --> 05:54:26,220
Not you.

1765
05:54:26,220 --> 05:54:40,080
Get him.

1766
05:54:40,619 --> 05:54:41,119
More.

1767
05:54:42,840 --> 05:54:43,340
More.

1768
05:54:51,259 --> 05:54:51,659
Get in.

1769
05:54:51,659 --> 05:54:51,979
Go.

1770
05:54:51,979 --> 05:54:52,479
Go.

1771
05:54:53,080 --> 05:54:53,400
Get him.

1772
05:54:53,400 --> 05:54:53,880
Get him.

1773
05:54:53,880 --> 05:54:54,119
Get him.

1774
05:54:54,119 --> 05:54:54,680
He's on the ground.

1775
05:54:55,319 --> 05:54:55,819
No.

1776
05:55:03,240 --> 05:55:03,560
Get him.

1777
05:55:03,560 --> 05:55:04,060
Get him.

1778
05:55:04,680 --> 05:55:05,479
I don't know what he's doing.

1779
05:55:06,040 --> 05:55:06,279
What?

1780
05:55:06,279 --> 05:55:06,840
Did I beat him?

1781
05:55:07,479 --> 05:55:09,790
I lost.

1782
05:55:09,790 --> 05:55:14,479
Oh my fucking God.

1783
05:55:15,819 --> 05:55:16,779
Stop rushing.

1784
05:55:16,779 --> 05:55:18,380
I can't attack him unless I get in close

1785
05:55:18,380 --> 05:55:19,500
because the only way I can attack him.

1786
05:55:20,909 --> 05:55:22,189
I have to get in close.

1787
05:55:22,189 --> 05:55:25,150
Otherwise, he just keeps doing the hurt your eyes move.

1788
05:55:25,950 --> 05:55:27,520
He's gonna do this forever.

1789
05:55:28,400 --> 05:55:35,259
The only way I can attack him is if I get in close.

1790
05:55:35,259 --> 05:55:49,279
I had it there, but instead of dodging,

1791
05:55:49,279 --> 05:55:50,319
I tried that before I get in close.

1792
05:55:51,279 --> 05:55:52,400
I can only jump over that one.

1793
05:55:52,400 --> 05:55:54,080
I can dodge through the...

1794
05:55:54,080 --> 05:55:56,319
I can only jump over the circle on the ground.

1795
05:55:56,319 --> 05:55:56,639
See?

1796
05:55:56,639 --> 05:55:57,139
Look.

1797
05:55:59,759 --> 05:56:00,259
Look.

1798
05:56:00,639 --> 05:56:06,490
Three people telling me to jump.

1799
05:56:30,330 --> 05:56:31,770
I had like 30% health.

1800
05:56:31,770 --> 05:56:32,330
I'm not gonna just...

1801
05:56:33,049 --> 05:56:33,930
I need full health.

1802
05:56:44,509 --> 05:56:45,950
I need full health.

1803
05:56:45,950 --> 05:56:56,240
It wasn't paying attention.

1804
05:56:56,240 --> 05:56:56,799
Idiot.

1805
05:56:56,799 --> 05:57:09,389
It was three people that told me to jump.

1806
05:57:09,389 --> 05:57:10,750
It's faster than dodging.

1807
05:57:10,750 --> 05:57:11,229
Thanks, guys.

1808
05:57:26,220 --> 05:57:26,619
No, really.

1809
05:57:26,619 --> 05:57:27,020
Thanks.

1810
05:57:27,020 --> 05:57:27,580
Like, I wouldn't...

1811
05:57:27,580 --> 05:57:28,299
I would have been like,

1812
05:57:28,299 --> 05:57:29,180
what the fuck are they talking about?

1813
05:57:29,180 --> 05:57:29,419
What the fuck?

1814
05:57:29,419 --> 05:57:30,619
Are they fucking stupid?

1815
05:57:32,139 --> 05:57:36,490
That was like $6,000.

1816
05:57:37,529 --> 05:57:44,119
What's the point of a dodge roll?

1817
05:57:45,000 --> 05:57:49,849
What's the point of a dodge roll?

1818
05:57:49,849 --> 05:57:50,810
Why is there a dodge roll?

1819
05:57:51,529 --> 05:58:18,220
I just parked him.

1820
05:58:21,599 --> 05:58:22,319
I just parked him.

1821
05:58:26,000 --> 05:58:26,880
What the...

1822
05:58:27,759 --> 05:58:30,509
Oops.

1823
05:58:48,959 --> 05:58:49,459
It's over.

1824
05:58:50,560 --> 05:58:51,369
Wait.

1825
05:58:51,369 --> 05:58:52,330
That's not part of the video.

1826
05:58:53,369 --> 05:59:24,599
Not that I don't even care.

1827
05:59:50,490 --> 05:59:51,930
I seem to like to do this to people.

1828
05:59:54,490 --> 05:59:56,569
I like to lift them up and let them talk.

1829
05:59:56,569 --> 05:59:57,130
Or their neck.

1830
06:00:16,759 --> 06:00:17,400
Behold.

1831
06:00:18,360 --> 06:00:20,279
This is that very power.

1832
06:00:21,000 --> 06:00:26,090
Wait, is this supposed to be him?

1833
06:00:42,060 --> 06:00:44,299
We have to fight the galaxy brain guy?

1834
06:00:48,880 --> 06:00:50,639
I don't know why that's making me laugh.

1835
06:00:58,119 --> 06:01:00,599
Galaxy brain.

1836
06:01:00,599 --> 06:01:05,900
I'm stupid.

1837
06:01:09,880 --> 06:01:12,680
Sakura Geninam Indra Deus.

1838
06:01:17,880 --> 06:01:21,279
Destiny, it is me.

1839
06:01:24,540 --> 06:01:27,279
Okay.

1840
06:01:30,860 --> 06:01:41,610
It doesn't matter how big you get.

1841
06:01:41,610 --> 06:01:42,409
You can just see that.

1842
06:01:43,209 --> 06:01:45,450
Well, we finally agree.

1843
06:01:46,650 --> 06:01:48,169
That doesn't make us friends.

1844
06:01:48,810 --> 06:01:49,610
Of course not.

1845
06:01:50,729 --> 06:01:52,700
Still, Deus.

1846
06:01:53,659 --> 06:01:55,659
So, this is your decision.

1847
06:01:56,619 --> 06:01:57,340
But this is...

1848
06:01:59,099 --> 06:02:01,180
Now stop talking to yourself.

1849
06:02:02,220 --> 06:02:03,020
Asura, you...

1850
06:02:04,200 --> 06:02:08,279
With a target that big, we can't miss.

1851
06:02:09,000 --> 06:02:11,180
Always dwelling on the fight.

1852
06:02:11,979 --> 06:02:12,619
Very well.

1853
06:02:15,279 --> 06:02:18,799
What is he doing?

1854
06:02:18,799 --> 06:02:19,279
Oh, he's...

1855
06:02:20,000 --> 06:02:21,119
Right, he's hauling his car.

1856
06:02:29,209 --> 06:02:31,549
Who said you could board?

1857
06:02:32,189 --> 06:02:34,270
You and I will settle this later.

1858
06:02:34,909 --> 06:02:36,169
But how was I going to get there?

1859
06:02:36,169 --> 06:02:37,130
You'll fly.

1860
06:02:37,130 --> 06:02:39,869
Do not blame me if you fall off.

1861
06:02:39,869 --> 06:02:40,750
How was I going to get there?

1862
06:02:42,590 --> 06:02:45,000
Oh, we're going to have to deal with...

1863
06:02:45,000 --> 06:02:45,720
We're going to have to do the...

1864
06:02:46,759 --> 06:02:48,599
Walk on and shoot enemies for an episode.

1865
06:02:49,720 --> 06:03:37,369
It is a little bit 18 up to date.

1866
06:03:37,369 --> 06:03:39,310
Are we about to beat the...

1867
06:03:39,310 --> 06:03:41,470
Are we about to fight the final boss?

1868
06:03:42,990 --> 06:03:43,950
Of course.

1869
06:03:43,950 --> 06:03:44,450
Whatever.

1870
06:03:45,549 --> 06:03:47,900
Grenade up his nose or something.

1871
06:03:47,900 --> 06:03:48,779
Or whatever I'm going to do here.

1872
06:04:31,659 --> 06:04:32,299
Still going?

1873
06:04:33,020 --> 06:04:45,560
Or get too full of moves?

1874
06:04:46,439 --> 06:04:53,659
I mean, this is cool.

1875
06:04:54,459 --> 06:04:55,020
It's cool.

1876
06:04:56,220 --> 06:04:57,659
But I'm not really doing it.

1877
06:05:06,560 --> 06:05:25,680
Good.

1878
06:05:25,680 --> 06:05:38,669
Dumbass is wasting your wing points.

1879
06:06:00,319 --> 06:06:00,819
More?

1880
06:06:02,000 --> 06:06:30,770
Tilted?

1881
06:06:38,650 --> 06:06:41,290
A thousand years for a gigantic toy.

1882
06:06:43,450 --> 06:06:45,290
That's definitely better than a toy.

1883
06:06:47,400 --> 06:06:49,369
It's like the king of all cosmos.

1884
06:06:59,209 --> 06:07:05,049
He's clapping us.

1885
06:07:05,049 --> 06:07:05,770
He's clapping us.

1886
06:07:06,490 --> 06:07:08,169
He's going to squish us together in his palms.

1887
06:07:08,889 --> 06:07:15,369
Why not?

1888
06:07:15,369 --> 06:07:16,819
Pray?

1889
06:07:30,090 --> 06:07:30,770
Did he get us?

1890
06:07:38,569 --> 06:07:39,290
Nope.

1891
06:07:39,290 --> 06:07:39,790
Maybe.

1892
06:07:40,490 --> 06:07:40,990
You'll see.

1893
06:07:42,169 --> 06:07:59,720
Design?

1894
06:07:59,720 --> 06:08:02,680
Yeah, that big guy is pretty cool.

1895
06:08:02,680 --> 06:08:03,479
Pretty cool.

1896
06:08:03,799 --> 06:08:04,360
I will say.

1897
06:08:05,080 --> 06:08:10,349
Here goes 17.

1898
06:08:13,959 --> 06:08:15,080
Aliyoth on the bridge.

1899
06:08:15,799 --> 06:08:18,200
Ah, sakra, davanam, indra, deus.

1900
06:08:18,200 --> 06:08:20,119
I cannot believe I'm seeing it with my own eyes.

1901
06:08:20,119 --> 06:08:21,159
It's magnificent.

1902
06:08:21,159 --> 06:08:23,639
Not even the colossi compared to its power.

1903
06:08:23,639 --> 06:08:25,080
By merging with the karma fortress,

1904
06:08:25,080 --> 06:08:27,080
it has become the most powerful being in existence.

1905
06:08:27,959 --> 06:08:30,040
It'll purify Goma Viltra.

1906
06:08:30,040 --> 06:08:31,720
With the use of the priestess's power

1907
06:08:31,720 --> 06:08:34,040
and the seven trillion souls we have accumulated.

1908
06:08:34,040 --> 06:08:35,159
There's a lot of people on Earth.

1909
06:08:38,110 --> 06:08:39,069
That's a lot.

1910
06:08:39,709 --> 06:08:40,209
That's...

1911
06:08:40,669 --> 06:08:42,110
Seems like too many people on Earth.

1912
06:08:43,400 --> 06:08:45,880
But would that not also destroy the planet as well?

1913
06:08:45,880 --> 06:08:47,159
Seven trillion people?

1914
06:08:49,520 --> 06:08:51,520
Perhaps it was just the brahmastra.

1915
06:08:52,540 --> 06:08:54,860
Now that lord deus is merged with the karma fortress,

1916
06:08:54,860 --> 06:08:57,740
he can concentrate blast with great precision.

1917
06:08:58,619 --> 06:09:01,439
Sakra, davanam, indra, deus is invincible.

1918
06:09:02,479 --> 06:09:03,119
Lots of fun.

1919
06:09:03,759 --> 06:09:04,259
Laugh.

1920
06:09:11,439 --> 06:09:13,360
They've been farming the planet for 12,000 years.

1921
06:09:14,240 --> 06:09:15,759
Yeah, but haven't we been...

1922
06:09:16,639 --> 06:09:18,479
Aren't we under the knowledge that they've been using it?

1923
06:09:19,680 --> 06:09:22,959
Like cast spells and throw parties and stuff

1924
06:09:22,959 --> 06:09:25,919
and have power and do stuff and destroy things, right?

1925
06:09:25,919 --> 06:09:26,959
They've been using it, haven't they?

1926
06:09:37,040 --> 06:09:50,509
Episode 17, fleet of play.

1927
06:10:02,119 --> 06:10:06,700
We crashed!

1928
06:10:08,779 --> 06:10:11,130
We gotta kill his heart now!

1929
06:10:24,799 --> 06:10:25,439
Why is it...

1930
06:10:25,439 --> 06:10:27,200
I don't know why that's making me laugh tonight.

1931
06:10:28,240 --> 06:10:29,439
Why is that doing that?

1932
06:10:29,439 --> 06:10:31,040
I don't know why I think that's funny today.

1933
06:10:33,580 --> 06:10:34,220
Sorry.

1934
06:10:34,220 --> 06:10:35,340
No, who cares?

1935
06:10:35,340 --> 06:10:36,299
Fuck that.

1936
06:10:36,299 --> 06:10:36,860
I'm not sorry.

1937
06:10:38,939 --> 06:10:40,590
I'm sorry!

1938
06:10:41,470 --> 06:10:45,979
It's probably Mr. Apology now because of the ayaya.

1939
06:10:47,020 --> 06:10:52,560
Now I think if I eat like peanut butter and jelly

1940
06:10:52,560 --> 06:10:55,040
with like the peanut butter on the top instead of the bottom,

1941
06:10:55,040 --> 06:10:56,720
I gotta have to apologize to you guys for that.

1942
06:10:57,680 --> 06:10:59,369
Oh, dance game?

1943
06:10:59,369 --> 06:11:00,569
You don't do jelly on top?

1944
06:11:00,569 --> 06:11:01,069
I'm sorry.

1945
06:11:01,930 --> 06:11:23,860
Open it!

1946
06:11:37,279 --> 06:11:38,240
Sonic Adventure 2.

1947
06:11:39,119 --> 06:11:40,319
Tails mechanic.

1948
06:11:41,119 --> 06:11:43,150
I actually have to control this shit.

1949
06:11:43,790 --> 06:11:46,669
This is the reactor that turns the souls into mantra.

1950
06:11:47,549 --> 06:11:50,830
If we destroy it, it will cut off Deus's energy supply.

1951
06:11:59,240 --> 06:12:00,360
Wait, should I be breaking these?

1952
06:12:01,639 --> 06:12:04,400
I can't break them.

1953
06:12:05,040 --> 06:12:12,040
I'm just trying to talk.

1954
06:12:12,040 --> 06:12:14,119
I can't not hear anything you say.

1955
06:12:15,080 --> 06:12:21,759
Sorry, I can't hear you.

1956
06:12:21,759 --> 06:12:23,279
I'm destroying all the capsules.

1957
06:12:46,159 --> 06:13:03,599
What?

1958
06:13:04,139 --> 06:13:05,869
That's not fair.

1959
06:13:06,669 --> 06:13:07,470
There's no opening.

1960
06:13:12,639 --> 06:13:24,439
I'm getting it.

1961
06:13:24,439 --> 06:13:24,919
Great.

1962
06:13:24,919 --> 06:13:26,680
I'm going through it.

1963
06:13:26,680 --> 06:13:32,520
Okay, you know there's a problem when Aladdin the Super Nintendo

1964
06:13:32,520 --> 06:13:33,799
didn't do that.

1965
06:13:33,799 --> 06:13:34,520
There's an issue here.

1966
06:13:44,090 --> 06:13:49,819
Fire now.

1967
06:13:50,680 --> 06:14:19,400
These lasers are terrible.

1968
06:14:20,599 --> 06:14:22,919
Look at how bad these lasers are.

1969
06:14:22,919 --> 06:14:25,549
You don't have a laser that can shoot forward.

1970
06:14:27,439 --> 06:14:31,759
It's just arched up and down left and right while you just shoot it.

1971
06:14:34,939 --> 06:14:37,259
I'm getting real sick of the zooming on the face

1972
06:14:37,259 --> 06:14:38,220
and then hit Y.

1973
06:14:38,220 --> 06:14:39,419
It's happened a hundred times.

1974
06:14:40,380 --> 06:14:42,139
It's happened a hundred times.

1975
06:14:45,849 --> 06:15:05,860
Hurry.

1976
06:15:09,950 --> 06:15:14,650
Jerma hates the game.

1977
06:15:14,650 --> 06:15:15,849
Feels bad, man.

1978
06:15:16,650 --> 06:15:18,779
No, I'm fine.

1979
06:15:18,779 --> 06:15:38,799
This game would be so much better if his other four hands

1980
06:15:39,439 --> 06:15:41,439
turned into mouths and talked.

1981
06:15:42,319 --> 06:15:44,799
They'll like, they'll be fun.

1982
06:15:46,560 --> 06:15:49,279
They talk to each other and shit and turned and it was like the mouth hand.

1983
06:15:49,840 --> 06:15:51,919
That'd be awesome.

1984
06:15:51,919 --> 06:15:56,599
I do understand.

1985
06:15:57,159 --> 06:16:00,110
I must do what I think is right.

1986
06:16:02,560 --> 06:16:04,560
I am the god that carries the fate of civilization on his shoulders.

1987
06:16:04,560 --> 06:16:05,840
I'm talking about like his puppet.

1988
06:16:06,479 --> 06:16:07,599
His hands are puppets.

1989
06:16:08,959 --> 06:16:11,599
And they talk and they have different personalities and shit.

1990
06:16:12,000 --> 06:16:14,799
You are a danger to my words.

1991
06:16:14,799 --> 06:16:17,279
Consider your lies, puppet.

1992
06:16:17,279 --> 06:16:17,779
What?

1993
06:16:18,959 --> 06:16:20,080
He's actually crazy.

1994
06:16:21,200 --> 06:16:21,840
What do you mean?

1995
06:16:21,840 --> 06:16:22,340
What?

1996
06:16:52,270 --> 06:17:03,340
Back up, back up, back up.

1997
06:17:03,340 --> 06:17:03,900
What's he doing?

1998
06:17:11,279 --> 06:17:11,779
Oh!

1999
06:17:12,400 --> 06:17:23,500
Is it the same boss?

2000
06:17:23,500 --> 06:17:24,000
I think so.

2001
06:17:27,290 --> 06:17:43,209
I'm distracting him.

2002
06:17:43,209 --> 06:17:43,709
Hit him.

2003
06:17:44,110 --> 06:17:45,069
Hit him, hit him.

2004
06:17:45,069 --> 06:17:45,569
Nice job.

2005
06:17:46,270 --> 06:17:46,950
All right, get in.

2006
06:17:47,569 --> 06:17:49,150
That's what we call teamwork.

2007
06:17:50,430 --> 06:18:03,270
Get in.

2008
06:18:07,299 --> 06:18:08,020
Oh shit.

2009
06:18:08,580 --> 06:18:14,689
No, get in.

2010
06:18:16,669 --> 06:18:17,169
Get in.

2011
06:18:17,310 --> 06:18:18,509
One of us can distract him.

2012
06:18:19,310 --> 06:18:32,939
Wait, don't get it.

2013
06:18:33,580 --> 06:18:38,770
Just call, just call, get in.

2014
06:18:38,770 --> 06:18:58,779
Get in, good.

2015
06:18:58,779 --> 06:19:00,479
Oh, now it's just one v one.

2016
06:19:00,479 --> 06:19:01,520
God damn it.

2017
06:19:01,520 --> 06:19:02,639
We can't co-op him anymore.

2018
06:19:10,770 --> 06:19:11,270
Jesus.

2019
06:19:11,810 --> 06:19:25,009
See what to do here.

2020
06:19:25,009 --> 06:19:27,009
I don't know what to do.

2021
06:19:27,009 --> 06:19:34,419
I can't get this.

2022
06:19:38,990 --> 06:19:46,369
It was slow.

2023
06:19:46,369 --> 06:19:51,229
Man, that move sucks.

2024
06:19:52,110 --> 06:19:53,310
So I don't know what he's going to do with it.

2025
06:20:11,599 --> 06:20:12,400
Jesus, man.

2026
06:20:12,400 --> 06:20:14,400
Give me an opportunity.

2027
06:20:14,400 --> 06:20:29,029
Don't die.

2028
06:20:50,319 --> 06:20:50,819
What?

2029
06:20:56,130 --> 06:20:56,630
What happened?

2030
06:21:02,720 --> 06:21:04,319
We were doing a, we were about to do a

2031
06:21:05,119 --> 06:21:06,560
TTE.

2032
06:21:06,619 --> 06:21:07,119
It didn't.

2033
06:21:07,979 --> 06:21:11,580
Okay, let's go.

2034
06:21:12,220 --> 06:21:13,419
I know what someone was moving up.

2035
06:21:18,049 --> 06:21:23,740
I'll get him.

2036
06:21:23,740 --> 06:21:25,700
Done.

2037
06:21:32,610 --> 06:21:39,110
Stupid.

2038
06:21:43,900 --> 06:21:44,400
Damn it.

2039
06:21:44,400 --> 06:21:45,340
I thought he was doing the jump thing.

2040
06:22:01,520 --> 06:22:06,639
We haven't grabbed for that long.

2041
06:22:07,520 --> 06:22:12,319
It's hard to tell what he's going to do.

2042
06:22:13,279 --> 06:22:32,029
All right, this is a bust.

2043
06:22:32,029 --> 06:22:32,830
This is a shit run.

2044
06:22:35,389 --> 06:22:56,959
Are they cheating this game?

2045
06:22:59,259 --> 06:22:59,759
Probably.

2046
06:23:00,299 --> 06:23:01,340
I'm not going to use them though.

2047
06:23:08,319 --> 06:23:08,819
Really?

2048
06:23:08,880 --> 06:23:19,810
I don't like this LOL.

2049
06:23:19,970 --> 06:23:20,610
Yeah.

2050
06:23:20,610 --> 06:23:21,110
Yep.

2051
06:23:21,729 --> 06:23:22,529
Yep, yep, yep.

2052
06:23:23,330 --> 06:23:35,720
Man.

2053
06:24:00,720 --> 06:24:01,220
Move, do it.

2054
06:24:02,400 --> 06:24:04,130
Oh, that's not the move I wanted you to do.

2055
06:24:08,259 --> 06:24:08,900
Shit.

2056
06:24:08,900 --> 06:24:10,580
Oh, that's so bad to fuck up.

2057
06:24:10,580 --> 06:24:13,060
That was almost 80% of my whole health for the fuck me.

2058
06:24:22,909 --> 06:24:28,419
It's just when you get in close and you're fighting and it's just like cutting.

2059
06:24:28,419 --> 06:24:28,919
Oh, nope.

2060
06:24:28,919 --> 06:24:31,159
You pressed B because you were pressing B to attack the guy.

2061
06:24:41,799 --> 06:24:46,599
When you get in close again, it doesn't seem it's just like you're pressing B because you're hitting and you're attacking.

2062
06:24:47,479 --> 06:24:53,759
And this shit got buried in hell in 2000 fucking 15.

2063
06:25:07,680 --> 06:25:18,049
Like nobody wants this back.

2064
06:25:18,049 --> 06:25:20,209
Might as well just die again, Jeremy.

2065
06:25:21,330 --> 06:25:41,540
Did I just play it on normal?

2066
06:25:41,540 --> 06:25:45,299
I was like the second last boss in the game and I can't change it back now.

2067
06:25:45,299 --> 06:25:46,659
I'm gonna beat this motherfucker as well.

2068
06:26:29,349 --> 06:26:30,150
How many have left?

2069
06:26:31,669 --> 06:26:33,590
I don't even know how many deities have left.

2070
06:26:36,630 --> 06:26:38,229
We've time traveled like three times.

2071
06:26:52,319 --> 06:26:53,200
Fuck.

2072
06:26:53,200 --> 06:26:56,919
He stays on the ground.

2073
06:26:56,919 --> 06:26:57,880
I keep forgetting it.

2074
06:27:05,169 --> 06:27:12,119
It didn't.

2075
06:27:12,900 --> 06:27:25,009
My hand's sweating.

2076
06:27:25,810 --> 06:27:33,060
Did he hit me with something?

2077
06:27:33,779 --> 06:27:45,639
I wanted to fight the electricity man again.

2078
06:27:46,439 --> 06:27:48,200
For all the people I have to fight again.

2079
06:27:49,159 --> 06:27:50,200
They're just killing me.

2080
06:27:51,639 --> 06:27:59,700
Did I start making bite marks?

2081
06:28:01,459 --> 06:28:08,930
Can't go in.

2082
06:28:08,930 --> 06:28:09,090
All right.

2083
06:28:09,090 --> 06:28:09,409
Here we go.

2084
06:28:09,409 --> 06:28:09,810
This is the one.

2085
06:28:10,369 --> 06:28:31,909
It's only I'm gonna say it.

2086
06:28:51,330 --> 06:28:51,729
Hold on.

2087
06:28:51,729 --> 06:28:54,689
I love how Jeremy's too stupid to recover health.

2088
06:28:54,689 --> 06:28:55,650
What are you talking about?

2089
06:28:56,369 --> 06:28:58,209
What do you mean to recover health?

2090
06:28:58,209 --> 06:28:59,009
What do you wait?

2091
06:28:59,009 --> 06:28:59,509
What?

2092
06:29:00,900 --> 06:29:01,700
You're a liar.

2093
06:29:01,700 --> 06:29:02,340
You're a liar.

2094
06:29:03,060 --> 06:29:22,549
I would laugh so hard if I was able to recover health the whole game.

2095
06:29:25,330 --> 06:29:27,889
That would be an embarrassment.

2096
06:29:27,889 --> 06:29:44,200
I'm gonna stop doing that.

2097
06:29:44,840 --> 06:29:54,450
I'll go in.

2098
06:29:54,450 --> 06:29:59,459
You have to jump if you're getting hit.

2099
06:29:59,779 --> 06:30:00,580
I haven't gotten hit yet.

2100
06:30:01,860 --> 06:30:03,220
This whole time I've been playing.

2101
06:30:03,220 --> 06:30:04,419
My health has been dropping.

2102
06:30:04,419 --> 06:30:05,060
I have like a debuff.

2103
06:30:05,060 --> 06:30:05,860
I don't know what the fuck's wrong.

2104
06:30:15,040 --> 06:30:38,450
This is the one right here.

2105
06:30:38,450 --> 06:30:39,090
This is the one.

2106
06:30:39,090 --> 06:30:39,490
This is the one.

2107
06:30:39,490 --> 06:30:39,970
This is the one.

2108
06:30:44,369 --> 06:30:44,930
Patience.

2109
06:30:44,930 --> 06:30:45,810
Just have patience.

2110
06:30:49,880 --> 06:30:50,119
Come on.

2111
06:30:50,119 --> 06:30:58,680
Come at me.

2112
06:30:58,680 --> 06:31:05,040
This is the one right here.

2113
06:31:05,680 --> 06:31:06,000
All right.

2114
06:31:06,000 --> 06:31:06,959
Now we have to do.

2115
06:31:06,959 --> 06:31:09,200
Now we have to trade with Asura.

2116
06:31:09,200 --> 06:31:10,159
And do the same thing again.

2117
06:31:11,919 --> 06:31:13,880
I'm ready for it.

2118
06:31:13,880 --> 06:31:24,080
What the fuck are you doing, Jeremy?

2119
06:31:24,080 --> 06:31:24,639
What are you doing?

2120
06:31:24,639 --> 06:31:25,840
What are you doing, Jeremy?

2121
06:31:26,639 --> 06:31:27,279
I'm doing too fast.

2122
06:31:27,279 --> 06:31:27,759
It's a problem.

2123
06:31:28,400 --> 06:31:33,639
It's too fast.

2124
06:31:33,639 --> 06:31:34,040
I don't like this.

2125
06:31:34,680 --> 06:31:40,529
Get him.

2126
06:31:40,529 --> 06:31:48,290
Okay, we're good.

2127
06:31:48,290 --> 06:32:07,139
I'm gonna get the fucking stuff.

2128
06:32:07,139 --> 06:32:07,540
Fucking stuff.

2129
06:32:07,540 --> 06:32:07,860
Fucking stuff.

2130
06:32:07,860 --> 06:32:08,340
Exactly.

2131
06:32:09,139 --> 06:32:20,979
I thought he was just gonna go on, so.

2132
06:32:20,979 --> 06:32:21,540
I'm curious.

2133
06:32:24,790 --> 06:32:25,270
Do it.

2134
06:32:25,270 --> 06:32:25,909
Do it.

2135
06:32:25,909 --> 06:32:26,950
Just do it already.

2136
06:32:27,669 --> 06:33:08,759
Do we have to do phase three with this guy?

2137
06:33:43,159 --> 06:33:51,669
I'll be okay.

2138
06:33:55,000 --> 06:33:57,360
I'll just look up and.

2139
06:33:57,360 --> 06:33:58,799
Now all my teeth are gone.

2140
06:33:58,799 --> 06:33:59,439
I'll be all right.

2141
06:33:59,439 --> 06:35:00,869
I didn't even say it this time.

2142
06:35:00,869 --> 06:35:05,459
She cries because she knows of the world's suffering.

2143
06:35:05,459 --> 06:35:11,000
Once my world is liberated from the gold mine, I shall cease all the cries.

2144
06:35:11,080 --> 06:35:21,880
I'm crying right now.

2145
06:35:21,880 --> 06:35:22,759
They killed this dude.

2146
06:35:55,540 --> 06:35:56,020
Oh, no.

2147
06:35:56,659 --> 06:36:16,340
I knew I had to do it again.

2148
06:36:21,439 --> 06:36:22,790
Die.

2149
06:36:22,790 --> 06:36:23,110
Yeah.

2150
06:36:27,400 --> 06:36:29,479
I was out of that fucking range.

2151
06:36:33,430 --> 06:36:34,229
What the fuck?

2152
06:36:37,520 --> 06:36:38,319
What is that?

2153
06:36:38,319 --> 06:36:39,459
What is happening?

2154
06:36:45,459 --> 06:37:03,919
I tried to fucking dodge.

2155
06:37:03,919 --> 06:37:04,799
I'm fucked.

2156
06:37:04,799 --> 06:37:06,240
Now I'm gonna do this shit again.

2157
06:37:10,799 --> 06:37:13,880
He got me with a reverse counter.

2158
06:37:13,880 --> 06:37:39,250
Press B.

2159
06:37:39,250 --> 06:37:39,889
Yeah, I know.

2160
06:37:39,889 --> 06:37:40,450
So easy.

2161
06:37:40,450 --> 06:37:41,970
Just press the B button, like.

2162
06:37:41,970 --> 06:37:43,490
And then sometimes press A.

2163
06:37:45,169 --> 06:37:46,610
Why is it so hard for you?

2164
06:37:47,650 --> 06:37:59,330
All right.

2165
06:37:59,330 --> 06:37:59,970
That's what happens.

2166
06:38:02,319 --> 06:38:03,040
Holy fuck.

2167
06:38:03,840 --> 06:38:05,669
That's recovered.

2168
06:38:20,659 --> 06:38:21,060
Hold on.

2169
06:38:21,060 --> 06:38:22,340
I've done that move before, though.

2170
06:38:22,900 --> 06:38:23,299
Hold on.

2171
06:38:23,299 --> 06:38:24,099
I need to test this.

2172
06:38:26,259 --> 06:38:29,619
It's back to getting hit.

2173
06:38:29,619 --> 06:38:29,779
Yeah.

2174
06:38:30,979 --> 06:38:33,279
That was not working.

2175
06:38:35,880 --> 06:38:37,560
I see.

2176
06:38:37,560 --> 06:38:38,439
I didn't recover health.

2177
06:38:39,319 --> 06:38:42,240
It's recovering a little bit of health.

2178
06:38:50,869 --> 06:38:52,799
You take less damage.

2179
06:38:52,799 --> 06:38:53,279
Right.

2180
06:38:53,279 --> 06:38:54,319
It's worded weirdly.

2181
06:38:55,360 --> 06:38:59,400
It's you take less damage, not recover health.

2182
06:38:59,400 --> 06:39:00,680
You take less damage.

2183
06:39:02,580 --> 06:39:02,979
Are they?

2184
06:39:02,979 --> 06:39:04,419
Why do they word that so strangely?

2185
06:39:06,319 --> 06:39:06,959
I remember reading that.

2186
06:39:06,959 --> 06:39:08,240
It was like, oh, you take less damage.

2187
06:39:09,220 --> 06:39:11,380
But, like, after, like, I thought it was, like,

2188
06:39:11,380 --> 06:39:20,819
for, like, a few seconds after the recover damage, you salvage HP.

2189
06:39:28,450 --> 06:39:36,310
Why can't it just say you recover health?

2190
06:39:36,790 --> 06:39:55,830
Well, my back is wicked itchy right now.

2191
06:39:58,840 --> 06:40:00,229
I have, like, the itchiest back.

2192
06:40:00,229 --> 06:40:02,069
I have to, like, scratch my back with, like, a whip or something.

2193
06:40:02,069 --> 06:40:02,389
Hold on.

2194
06:40:05,119 --> 06:40:16,020
Imagine being so good you beat the game without healing.

2195
06:40:16,020 --> 06:40:17,139
See, that's a great way to look at it.

2196
06:40:17,139 --> 06:40:17,459
Thank you.

2197
06:40:20,529 --> 06:40:27,810
Is it always going to be B?

2198
06:40:27,810 --> 06:40:29,409
I'm scared to press it more than once.

2199
06:40:29,409 --> 06:40:30,130
That's why.

2200
06:40:30,130 --> 06:40:31,250
Is it going to be B every time?

2201
06:40:55,560 --> 06:40:57,430
Did you just counter it?

2202
06:40:58,229 --> 06:40:58,790
Why did you?

2203
06:40:58,790 --> 06:40:59,029
What?

2204
06:40:59,909 --> 06:41:01,750
Oh, really?

2205
06:41:02,389 --> 06:41:03,110
I got countered.

2206
06:41:03,909 --> 06:41:04,709
How'd he counter that?

2207
06:41:21,090 --> 06:41:27,159
In the circle.

2208
06:42:01,619 --> 06:42:08,849
I'm scared to try to go in the circle, I'll be honest.

2209
06:42:31,169 --> 06:42:31,409
All right.

2210
06:42:31,409 --> 06:42:32,689
Now punch it a million times.

2211
06:42:32,689 --> 06:42:33,330
It's always B.

2212
06:42:33,330 --> 06:42:33,970
It's always B.

2213
06:42:35,009 --> 06:42:42,880
Hold on.

2214
06:42:42,880 --> 06:42:43,439
Don't fuck it up.

2215
06:42:44,319 --> 06:42:49,909
I'm not going to get this fast.

2216
06:42:49,909 --> 06:43:06,709
Oh, god damn it.

2217
06:43:06,709 --> 06:43:30,950
All right.

2218
06:43:30,950 --> 06:43:31,349
Ammos.

2219
06:43:37,189 --> 06:43:38,069
Eat my ass.

2220
06:43:57,400 --> 06:43:57,880
Kill him.

2221
06:43:58,439 --> 06:44:01,060
You just beat this guy already.

2222
06:44:01,060 --> 06:44:02,180
I'm trying to do that.

2223
06:44:03,060 --> 06:44:03,939
Nobody even said that.

2224
06:44:03,939 --> 06:44:04,659
I'm just making that up.

2225
06:44:06,790 --> 06:44:07,590
Somebody probably did.

2226
06:44:08,389 --> 06:44:41,240
Not so fast.

2227
06:44:41,880 --> 06:44:42,840
I'm still alive.

2228
06:44:43,560 --> 06:44:44,759
Let's do this again.

2229
06:44:44,759 --> 06:44:46,680
You and me, two on two again.

2230
06:44:48,200 --> 06:44:56,709
Oh, that's it.

2231
06:44:56,709 --> 06:44:57,029
I got it.

2232
06:44:57,669 --> 06:45:09,200
Oh, wait.

2233
06:45:09,200 --> 06:45:12,880
He's not going to say, like, a funny line, like the goblin thing King does?

2234
06:45:13,680 --> 06:45:17,139
You're not going to, like, ruin a scene?

2235
06:45:30,119 --> 06:45:47,750
That's not how gravity works.

2236
06:45:48,709 --> 06:45:49,830
She's like a god.

2237
06:45:49,830 --> 06:45:50,950
She is weightless.

2238
06:46:10,200 --> 06:46:15,650
So you have power.

2239
06:46:15,650 --> 06:46:16,450
What do you think?

2240
06:46:17,330 --> 06:46:21,729
Charging at whatever is in front of you can save the world?

2241
06:46:41,729 --> 06:46:58,209
Yeah, that scared me a little bit, too.

2242
06:46:58,209 --> 06:47:02,849
That really was random loud noise in a YouTube video to fuck with you.

2243
06:47:03,650 --> 06:47:05,270
What do you mean?

2244
06:47:06,310 --> 06:47:32,310
You were the good guys.

2245
06:47:33,189 --> 06:47:38,959
This is, is this, he was the good guy?

2246
06:47:38,959 --> 06:47:46,200
You've lost your spirits.

2247
06:47:47,319 --> 06:47:51,490
Glitter is the will of the planet itself.

2248
06:47:52,130 --> 06:47:57,080
It will devour all the souls on Gaia.

2249
06:47:57,080 --> 06:47:59,729
Its power is limitless.

2250
06:48:01,860 --> 06:48:04,259
All the more reason we must defeat it.

2251
06:48:08,900 --> 06:48:09,700
Wait, Asura.

2252
06:48:11,779 --> 06:48:12,819
You didn't pay for it yet.

2253
06:48:15,750 --> 06:48:17,590
That cost $1,199.

2254
06:48:18,389 --> 06:48:20,740
I shouldn't.

2255
06:48:24,319 --> 06:48:25,279
Empty your pockets.

2256
06:48:26,000 --> 06:48:26,880
You never change.

2257
06:48:31,270 --> 06:48:34,930
Asura, how could I have been defeated?

2258
06:48:38,340 --> 06:48:39,220
Doesn't matter.

2259
06:48:43,700 --> 06:48:44,340
I see.

2260
06:48:45,700 --> 06:48:47,299
So not even you know.

2261
06:48:47,939 --> 06:48:51,060
And then there is no hope.

2262
06:48:51,060 --> 06:48:53,540
Just turn and just soccer kick this guy's head.

2263
06:48:54,979 --> 06:48:55,619
Mithra.

2264
06:48:55,619 --> 06:48:56,900
Just a full running start.

2265
06:48:57,619 --> 06:49:14,020
I do not deserve to be called your uncle.

2266
06:49:14,020 --> 06:49:15,139
That's your mom's brother.

2267
06:49:15,860 --> 06:49:16,580
It is all right.

2268
06:49:16,580 --> 06:49:17,700
The hell are you talking about?

2269
06:49:19,810 --> 06:49:20,610
Mithra.

2270
06:49:20,610 --> 06:49:23,779
There's father.

2271
06:49:23,779 --> 06:49:25,110
He is there.

2272
06:49:25,830 --> 06:49:28,400
He fought to save you.

2273
06:49:33,009 --> 06:49:35,090
There is still something left we must do.

2274
06:49:39,270 --> 06:49:40,630
We will end all of this.

2275
06:49:40,630 --> 06:49:41,270
Am I crying?

2276
06:49:44,599 --> 06:49:44,919
Come on.

2277
06:49:44,919 --> 06:49:45,799
You can hear that?

2278
06:49:45,799 --> 06:49:47,919
All Jerma is crying.

2279
06:49:47,919 --> 06:49:48,560
You can hear that?

2280
06:49:49,599 --> 06:49:53,189
I thought I could be emotional but I happen to be caught on camera.

2281
06:49:53,189 --> 06:50:02,580
So what are we supposed to do about this?

2282
06:50:04,580 --> 06:50:29,779
At what point do we just leave?

2283
06:50:30,819 --> 06:50:34,419
At what point do we just turn the fucking ship around and be like well

2284
06:50:34,419 --> 06:50:37,139
this 500 quadrillion other planets.

2285
06:50:38,259 --> 06:50:40,659
We just leave.

2286
06:50:40,659 --> 06:50:41,459
Go somewhere else.

2287
06:50:51,330 --> 06:50:54,130
You take a look at that and you kind of go yeah that's probably it.

2288
06:50:54,130 --> 06:50:55,330
That's probably it for Earth.

2289
06:50:55,889 --> 06:51:20,130
Defeat of Plague.

2290
06:51:23,349 --> 06:51:24,470
And the Imperial Hall.

2291
06:51:25,110 --> 06:51:28,389
My liege there's little time before Lytra's next revival.

2292
06:51:28,389 --> 06:51:30,630
We do not start preparing preemptive measures soon.

2293
06:51:30,630 --> 06:51:31,430
It will be too late.

2294
06:51:32,709 --> 06:51:35,110
Cruising to do nothing is also an option.

2295
06:51:35,110 --> 06:51:36,549
Change comes opposition.

2296
06:51:36,549 --> 06:51:38,310
Jinkoku would not respond well.

2297
06:51:38,310 --> 06:51:40,630
Well this is the kind of beginning that we fake killed.

2298
06:51:41,349 --> 06:51:44,229
Would you have our people take up arms and wait for Viltra's return

2299
06:51:44,229 --> 06:51:45,909
after we finally obtained a moment of peace?

2300
06:51:47,189 --> 06:51:49,509
With each awakening Viltra grows more powerful than the last.

2301
06:51:49,509 --> 06:51:51,590
Next time our forces may not be enough to subdue it.

2302
06:51:52,470 --> 06:51:54,950
The rate at which our civilization is growing far surpasses

2303
06:51:54,950 --> 06:51:55,990
that of the impure.

2304
06:51:56,630 --> 06:51:59,270
Furthermore the eight guardian generals have never been stronger

2305
06:51:59,270 --> 06:52:01,029
especially with such a powerful priestess.

2306
06:52:01,909 --> 06:52:05,750
Oh my liege enough I've given you my answer.

2307
06:52:05,750 --> 06:52:15,700
You are dismissed in Deus's office.

2308
06:52:15,700 --> 06:52:17,939
Commander Deus the emperor did not grant us permission.

2309
06:52:19,060 --> 06:52:21,939
Regrettably no the emperor is only interested in protecting himself.

2310
06:52:21,939 --> 06:52:25,700
He must be disposed of and you shall rise to the throne.

2311
06:52:25,700 --> 06:52:29,139
Brilliant do not misunderstand I have no intention of becoming emperor.

2312
06:52:29,939 --> 06:52:33,750
Mander was my destiny to purge this planet of the impure

2313
06:52:33,750 --> 06:52:36,549
and if I must be the one to guide our people in doing so then so be it.

2314
06:52:37,349 --> 06:52:40,770
I'll always be a warrior once we have accomplished our goal I shall reign.

2315
06:52:42,209 --> 06:52:48,930
Resign my post not not reign supreme not like reign all over everybody resign

2316
06:52:52,340 --> 06:52:54,659
but you'll just be sacrificing yourself for the cause.

2317
06:52:55,540 --> 06:52:59,459
My purpose has always been for the cause I have no desire to sit on a throne for all eternity.

2318
06:53:01,400 --> 06:53:02,680
The source of all gold.

2319
06:53:03,560 --> 06:53:19,040
Episode 18 this is it right.

2320
06:53:32,930 --> 06:53:34,290
I'm not doing the DLC tonight.

2321
06:53:47,279 --> 06:53:48,959
DLC is like five minutes.

2322
06:53:51,799 --> 06:53:56,790
Throw this game in the trash.

2323
06:53:58,950 --> 06:54:07,939
Holy shit it's two hours or so yeah I'm not doing a 10 hour stream.

2324
06:54:09,220 --> 06:54:20,529
What oh I thought we for a second I thought this was the DLC.

2325
06:54:22,610 --> 06:54:33,729
Let's go kill the snake inside the planet.

2326
06:54:34,369 --> 06:54:41,860
Can I still buy the DLC?

2327
06:54:58,930 --> 06:55:01,409
Microsoft points yeah it's a pain in the ass.

2328
06:55:12,130 --> 06:55:13,009
Oh I wasn't even looking.

2329
06:55:19,639 --> 06:55:23,779
I was just looking I was just talking to you guys I wasn't even watching.

2330
06:56:14,159 --> 06:56:15,919
They kind of have to deal with this shit every day.

2331
06:56:15,919 --> 06:57:51,540
Snake that's right this is snake snake number one there's one this is cool this is cool

2332
06:58:13,119 --> 06:58:17,759

2337
07:00:16,200 --> 07:00:29,119
there you go I would take out my cell phone and videotape and then fucking throw as hard

2338
07:00:29,119 --> 07:00:31,360
as I could in the space of the cell phone somebody would find it one day

2339
07:00:32,479 --> 07:00:35,759
just turn around and just whip it as hard as I can into space

2340

2345

2412
07:28:52,610 --> 07:29:35,990
waiting please my credit's number four Mithra who made this game well I'm surprised somebody's

2413
07:29:35,990 --> 07:29:41,430
saying that considering that let's say let's say the average viewer is here for let's say

2414
07:29:42,709 --> 07:29:46,709
30 minutes 20 30 minutes average time somebody spends on a stream maybe

2415
07:29:49,319 --> 07:29:56,119
Capcom's logo has popped up probably every 25 to 30 minutes so I'm actually surprised

2416
07:29:56,119 --> 07:30:23,380
that anyone would even ask that so this is the third running credit real wink all right fine

2417
07:30:24,340 --> 07:30:36,369
all right see you guys tomorrow I'm not doing DLC right now I'm the same being I'm not making

2418
07:30:36,369 --> 07:30:43,119
this a total fuckface stream no I'm going five days in a row here I'm not going to be let's do

2419
07:30:43,119 --> 07:30:49,240
11 and a half hours and let me fucking burn my eyes out no I'm not doing the DLC tomorrow

2420
07:30:49,240 --> 07:31:23,319
we're gonna do something else there you are in the freezer do the DLC we'll see what we got going

2421
07:31:23,319 --> 07:31:25,959
on this week I might throw it in here somewhere because there's a couple there's a bunch of other

2422
07:31:26,520 --> 07:31:33,119
I have like two other Xbox 360 games got NBA Street over here that I want to play

2423
07:31:34,000 --> 07:31:40,819
I just want to get the hard drive so I can actually play Tony Hawk

2424
07:31:41,619 --> 07:31:48,389
I want to do Outer Wilds this week too I've been putting that off for a long time

2425
07:31:49,509 --> 07:32:11,009
Noble Heroes 2 yeah we'll see I got a lot of games but I don't know who knows Black and White 2 is

2426
07:32:11,009 --> 07:32:22,709
also something I want to do I still have not the chibi robo I really really badly want to play it

2427
07:32:23,509 --> 07:32:38,560
I'm just gonna get it I'm just gonna get it but that was a Asura's Wrath it was pretty fun it was

2428
07:32:38,560 --> 07:32:55,169
over the top I enjoyed it it's not over well I mean it is but not it might not be I skipped this

2429
07:32:56,200 --> 07:33:03,569
I can't even skip it what are your impressions my impressions are uh all right the boss fights

2430
07:33:03,569 --> 07:33:10,159
were really cool just wish I didn't have to press Y as many times as I did like you even you take

2431
07:33:10,159 --> 07:33:14,400
away even half the times that I had to press the button Y and I would have probably thought this

2432
07:33:14,400 --> 07:33:34,020
is a very game the DLC is no I know about the DLC don't worry see if we can fit it in somewhere

2433
07:33:34,020 --> 07:33:35,860
because what is it like an hour or two couple hours

2434
07:33:43,299 --> 07:33:46,659
yeah all right well yeah we'll do it probably this week we'll throw it in somewhere

2435
07:33:47,380 --> 07:33:55,639
that's fine all right is it like after credit scene or something

2436
07:33:56,439 --> 07:34:04,180
with the Diablo yeah we could do Diablo 2 hardcore and then whatever happens with that

2437
07:34:04,180 --> 07:34:17,060
throw this at the end do the DLC now no I'm not doing a 10-hour stream

2438
07:34:33,009 --> 07:34:41,830
please yeah all right now I'm in I still play Return of the King and I'm kind of concerned

2439
07:34:41,830 --> 07:35:03,619
to play it just because you know how the last one went I can I skip this oh breaking point

2440

07:39:37,779 --> 07:39:45,029
a chance and then I beat the base game I thought it was good I just wish it was a little less

2464
07:39:45,029 --> 07:39:55,590
QTE just just enough for me to not you know think my nose at it was that phrase something like that

2465
07:39:55,590 --> 07:40:02,310
it was crazy though the fat boss yeah the the big fat boss that puts his finger down

2466
07:40:05,009 --> 07:40:12,049
the game was made during the end of the QTE yeah the era of QTE unfortunately still a fun game

2467
07:40:12,049 --> 07:40:22,849
though I did enjoy it otherwise I would not have played it I wouldn't have streamed the game for

2468
07:40:22,849 --> 07:40:27,880

run around as a dinosaur in that game I need to see if I can get a hold of some of those

2473
07:41:02,209 --> 07:41:05,250
though you hunt no yeah you hunt you hunt them they're attacking you and shit

2474
07:41:05,889 --> 07:41:11,040
let's check them out add them on the list we're gonna do Tony Hawk's underground today but I

2475
07:41:11,040 --> 07:41:17,560
didn't have an xbox hard drive or something it was embarrassing but it's all good we'll get that this

2476
07:41:17,560 --> 07:41:21,159
week I'm gonna play Tony Hawk's underground this week I really do so I'm gonna probably tomorrow

2477
07:41:21,159 --> 07:41:25,990
morning I'm gonna get up and we might even just do it tomorrow try to get up early and go get one

2478
07:41:26,709 --> 07:41:33,959
I wanted to do that today so we're gonna have to do that tomorrow

2479
07:41:37,990 --> 07:41:43,909
Vilemi gave 5 000 bits I missed this one they say German we tricked you into watching an anime on

2480
07:41:43,909 --> 07:41:51,240
stream the best part about this is talking to VR Josh about how much he recommended it he's like

2481
07:41:51,240 --> 07:41:55,479
don't play you gotta play Serious Wrath on stream it's awesome it's really good I'm like hey so what

2482
07:41:55,479 --> 07:42:04,840
why and he's like oh I didn't play it I watched like a few of the cutscenes I'm just I did not

2483
07:42:04,840 --> 07:42:07,799
say what did you say you said something like that you said something like what did you say

2484
07:42:08,520 --> 07:42:13,009
you said something like that read my recommendation what does it what does it say

2485
07:42:13,650 --> 07:42:26,419
he said it was like his favorite game ever made let's get recommendations let's go search VR Josh

2486
07:42:36,279 --> 07:42:41,479
he's deleting I've been recommending this a while but Serious Wrath for xbox c2 would be

2487
07:42:41,479 --> 07:42:45,240
worth experiencing on stream at least once a very flawed game but worth experiencing just for the

2488
07:42:45,240 --> 07:42:51,479
absurd cutscenes and boss battles the boss battles consist of mostly QTEs but the sheer

2489
07:42:51,479 --> 07:43:00,959
scale and anime nature of them make it worthwhile oh shit you did say that you didn't like it no you

2490
07:43:00,959 --> 07:43:10,080
said you liked it see yeah but but when I said hey what's what's makes the game so good you

2491
07:43:10,080 --> 07:43:14,880
didn't you say I don't know I didn't play it that long you said what did you say in the beginning

2492
07:43:14,880 --> 07:43:26,360
of the stream you said something in the beginning of the stream that's what I'm referring to he's

2493
07:43:26,360 --> 07:43:32,770
like oh I don't I didn't I didn't play it show us the corpse face again no all right you know

2499
07:44:17,000 --> 07:44:22,450
point this week I don't know it depends on I'm doing I'm gonna try to do Tony Hawk Underground

2500
07:44:22,450 --> 07:44:29,159
tomorrow so it's sitting on the same console so maybe I mean if I get really into Tony Hawk

2501
07:44:29,159 --> 07:44:32,759
Underground tomorrow and I play it for like six seven eight hours then of course I'm not gonna do

2502
07:44:32,759 --> 07:44:36,919
the dlc but if for some reason I only play Tony Hawk for a few hours or something then I'll just

2503
07:44:36,919 --> 07:44:46,240
stick it on top of that whatever we'll see I will do it gnarly thanks to the 250 here's a short

2504
07:44:46,240 --> 07:44:53,040

hopefully the tony hawks underground well I played the credits actually jumped what the

2518
07:47:30,869 --> 07:47:48,599
scare but I don't believe any noise underground 2 is more fun uh we're gonna have that's actually

2519
07:47:48,599 --> 07:48:00,040
a really really good question I have both of them I have both I was kind of unsure of what I wanted

2520
07:48:00,040 --> 07:48:14,209
to do I could just do both thug 2 is a baby game thug 1 is best thug 2 is better thug 1 is classic

2521
07:48:14,450 --> 07:48:22,180
yeah I don't I mean this I knew this was gonna happen so I got both so we can just do both

2522
07:48:22,180 --> 07:48:27,299
eventually we're probably gonna start with the first one it seems like right idea but here comes

2523
07:48:27,299 --> 07:48:37,840
up thanks a lot guys for your extreme support of this channel thank you the short games anyways

2524

2526
07:48:51,729 --> 07:48:55,959

2527
07:48:55,959 --> 07:49:03,189
yoshi's island or something but I don't know I'll figure that out anti-poison thanks for the 1500 bits

2528
07:49:04,389 --> 07:49:07,909
hey germo I was thinking about getting a germa rat tattoo and was wondering if you would be

2529
07:49:07,909 --> 07:49:12,389
okay with that that's not about me being okay with that it's about you being okay with that

2530
07:49:13,029 --> 07:49:18,549
uh in 10 years are you gonna think that that's all right still if you want a germa rat tattoo

2531
07:49:18,549 --> 07:49:29,270
that's a you thing that you have to decide I can't decide that for you I would give that a good

2532
07:49:29,270 --> 07:49:37,669
think um just don't put it on your face you know put it like I don't know somewhere you're gonna

2533
07:49:37,669 --> 07:49:47,919
hide it because in 30 years you might be like I don't know germa rat tattoo germa he disapproved

2534
07:49:47,919 --> 07:49:52,639
it never get don't know I didn't say don't get a tat don't I said don't put a rat tattoo a germa

2535
07:49:52,639 --> 07:50:01,540
rat tattoo on your face in 10 years the term is going to get cancelled for saying something

2536
07:50:01,540 --> 07:50:21,060
fucked up okay why are you planning on for this I don't like that you're planning for that

2537
07:50:24,740 --> 07:50:35,220
oh long story short if you're gonna get a tattoo make sure something that you really want um if

2538
07:50:35,220 --> 07:50:38,900
you come back to me in like three years and say hey this tattoo sucks why did you tell me to do

2539
07:50:38,900 --> 07:50:43,060
that I'm gonna say I didn't I'm gonna say I told you don't if you feed I have nothing to do with

2540
07:50:43,060 --> 07:50:53,319
this five years are gonna be 40 yeah don't remind me that hurts that comment I don't want to see

2541
07:50:53,319 --> 07:51:07,540

2543
07:51:12,979 --> 07:51:19,619
green for the 550 here my I would I had your stream up tonight while I was doing my uh my

2544
07:51:19,619 --> 07:51:24,180
testosterone injection when I pulled the needle out there was a lot of blood it was not anything

2545
07:51:24,180 --> 07:51:28,900
to worry about because it can happen but I yelled at the same time as sura did wait a lot of blood

2546
07:51:29,939 --> 07:51:53,299
why did I read that I don't know like I don't know everyone's gonna be streaming at 90 I don't

2547
07:51:53,299 --> 07:52:01,119
think I've ever had any injection I've ever had I don't think there's any blood blood from a needle

2548
07:52:01,759 --> 07:52:16,069
does it happen oh be careful why would you tell people this what me I I bet that I've never had

2549
07:52:16,069 --> 07:52:29,569
blood I bet having six arms would help I once got a flu shot and I'm not going to read the

2550
07:52:29,569 --> 07:52:35,330
rest of that because it's fucking horrifying so I'm not don't get a tattoo on your face of my face

2551
07:52:35,330 --> 07:52:42,819
okay don't do that it'll look really strange I'm sorry to hear that uh goku hopefully you're all

2552
07:52:42,819 --> 07:52:49,200
right plug boy thanks to the 500 bits what's up germa was wondering if back in the day you

2553
07:52:49,200 --> 07:52:54,000
were ever into any hardcore shooters like arma and such I've always been into been like escape

2554
07:52:54,000 --> 07:52:59,040
from tarkov has been stealing my heart recently not a recommendation though because considering

2555
07:52:59,040 --> 07:53:03,360
how you reacted while playing pub g you would hate it just not really into the br thing

2556
07:53:04,560 --> 07:53:11,680
no I never really got into armor no armor wasn't necessarily br but escape from tarkov kind of is

2557
07:53:15,319 --> 07:53:20,610
not really into the br thing though escape from tarkov isn't the battle royale

2558
07:53:21,330 --> 07:53:38,290
not what is it it isn't br what is it is it oh you just it's just an fps it's just a realistic

2559
07:53:38,290 --> 07:53:44,369
fps don't they like drop everybody in a spot and people have to like extract and shit it's

2560
07:53:44,369 --> 07:53:58,229
a rogue like fps multiplayer stalker without the anomalies arena huh that's all right that's cool

2561
07:53:58,229 --> 07:54:07,220
I thought it was br I stand corrected all right hey mark melzer uh thanks for the 250 hey germa

2562
07:54:07,220 --> 07:54:11,700
I've always loved your stream especially the rhythm ones as of late speaking of which would

2563
07:54:11,700 --> 07:54:18,020
you consider playing the path upon remaster on ps4 yes it's on the list glad to see a streamer

2564
07:54:18,020 --> 07:54:21,939
willing to play older pc games rather than what's hot at the moment this hidden cult classics out

2565
07:54:21,939 --> 07:54:28,849
there let me do the reason why I play so many old games is because I'm just not really into any of

2566
07:54:28,849 --> 07:54:34,209
the new ones you mentioned br br's are really really hot right now and some of the multiplayer

2567
07:54:34,209 --> 07:54:46,360
shooters are really really hot right now I'm just not really into them anymore I just not the last

2568
07:54:46,439 --> 07:54:52,919
two big gaming trends have been genres I don't really don't really care about the big moba

2569
07:54:52,919 --> 07:54:57,720
explosion five years ago or so I don't didn't really care besides I played smite but a little

2570
07:54:57,720 --> 07:55:04,819
bit not really so I didn't really jump on that too much and then this newest kind of

2571
07:55:05,700 --> 07:55:12,979
fps third person br it's been a big big explosion the last few years I haven't really been into that

2572
07:55:12,979 --> 07:55:23,680
either I made 15 videos on smite yeah but that was also back in like 2013 that's not very much

2573
07:55:23,680 --> 07:55:33,830
considering how big that genre was at the time the people still place my smile still a big thing

2574
07:55:34,389 --> 07:55:45,189
I still think it's good I haven't played in a long time 25 Dr Pepper thanks for the 250

2575
07:55:45,189 --> 07:55:54,549
Super Bowl prediction I'm from Kansas City so I'm a little biased um I just it's just gonna be a

2576
07:55:54,549 --> 07:56:10,470
fun game it's gonna be a fun game right chiefs I'm okay I'm gonna have to say I'm gonna have to say

2577
07:56:10,470 --> 07:56:18,040
the chiefs for one reason because of that old Snickers commercial where the guy paints the

2578
07:56:18,040 --> 07:56:25,720
end zone wrong he's the whole commercial is a guy painting the end zone for the chiefs he's doing

2579
07:56:25,720 --> 07:56:31,799
he's going up and down he's sweating he's wiping his brow and he's doing a really really good job

2580
07:56:31,799 --> 07:56:36,360
they don't show what he's writing and then one of the players comes up and he's like hey man

2581
07:56:36,360 --> 07:56:43,040
that's a really good job but who are the chefs it pans up and it's just the chefs he didn't put the

2582
07:56:43,040 --> 07:57:02,099
eye he's like oh Jesus so I'm gonna say the Kansas City Chief what a great commercial yeah there you

2583
07:57:02,099 --> 07:57:14,439
go this is my Super Bowl prediction all right chiefs Kansas City Chiefs 19 to 6 Kansas City

2584
07:57:14,439 --> 07:57:32,580
Chiefs 19 to 6 gonna be a fucked up game hey jerma put sun chips in f-tier yes it did thanks

2585
07:57:32,580 --> 07:57:36,659
to the 250 jerma I'm here to tell you that you're still dreaming after you got naked on stream one

2586
07:57:36,659 --> 07:57:40,819
guy saw your penis you passed out from embarrassment every stream from that moment has been in your head

2587
07:57:41,380 --> 07:57:44,819
only way you can wake up is to peek your mic also you should do it because it's my birthday

2588
07:57:45,700 --> 07:57:54,639
what a wonderful comment this is you this ticks this you checked every box happy birthday by the

2589
07:57:54,639 --> 07:58:07,939
way all right I'll see happy birthday seriously jerma put sun chips in f-tier have a good one hope

2590
07:58:07,939 --> 07:58:18,770
you had a lot of sun chips right we can't leave yet let's go one more just got one more vlog boy

2591
07:58:18,770 --> 07:58:22,369
thanks in 250 dropping some more bits for you tonight before I sign off I think a game you

2592
07:58:22,369 --> 07:58:28,209
would really severely enjoy possibly off-stream is disco-alsium I was gonna stream disco-alsium

2593
07:58:29,409 --> 07:58:32,369
but I decided not to some people told me it was way too long

2594
07:58:32,369 --> 07:58:43,000
and that I would get bored you got to remember if I cannot complete a game within two to four streams

2595
07:58:44,040 --> 07:58:57,860
it gradually drops I mean it gradually drops like a rock after that if I'm gonna play it again also

2596
07:58:57,860 --> 07:59:02,979
I'll be the big 21 next week and be upset there won't be a stream yes I will not be around next

2597
07:59:02,979 --> 07:59:11,560
week I got a lot of friends coming in but I don't have any plans on streaming it anymore

2598
07:59:12,119 --> 07:59:21,029
does look fun though but I'm not gonna catch you next week happy birthday plug boy preemptively

2599
07:59:22,389 --> 07:59:30,180
why am I uncommitted to playing games I mean I'm not uncommitted it's just okay here hear me out

2600
07:59:32,500 --> 07:59:39,299
if if a game is more than 40 hours to get through the main game off-stream I wouldn't really play it

2601
07:59:39,939 --> 07:59:43,700
also I wouldn't play it off-stream really Red Dead Redemption 2 is the only exception

2602
07:59:43,779 --> 07:59:48,580
in probably the last couple of years at least so if you're talking about like this stream is

2603
07:59:48,580 --> 07:59:52,259
eight hours a typical stream is somewhere around six and a half to like seven and a half hours

2604
07:59:52,259 --> 07:59:58,020
it's like a typical average stream on this channel so if I can't beat a game in like

2605
07:59:58,020 --> 08:00:01,779
40 to 50 hours I really don't want to walk in and play a game for like 100 hours

2606
08:00:06,439 --> 08:00:13,720
Dark Souls Dark Souls well I look there is an exception for some of that's like my one of my

2607
08:00:13,720 --> 08:00:21,080
favorite gaming franchises I love Dark Souls and I love all the Dark Souls games and all the

2608
08:00:21,080 --> 08:00:26,919
from software games so that's not really a fair comparison because you're talking about one of my

2609
08:00:26,919 --> 08:00:38,799
favorite game studio franchises ever Darkwood I beat Darkwood in three streams Darkwood was

2610
08:00:38,799 --> 08:00:55,990
three streams my game was crazy but yeah if if I can't do it in like under five full streams

2611
08:00:55,990 --> 08:00:58,389
it's something I'm probably not going to stream I'll just do it on my own time

2612
08:01:00,000 --> 08:01:05,759
unless it's something I'm so insanely into like for instance Elden Ring is going to come out

2613
08:01:05,759 --> 08:01:10,080
I'm going to stream every second of me playing that game just because I I can't wait and I'm

2614
08:01:10,080 --> 08:01:13,840
going to play it as long as it takes you guys know that's happening but that's something that I

2615
08:01:13,840 --> 08:01:30,610
kind of do should be fun but hopefully that gives you your answer thank you near shoe for

2616
08:01:30,610 --> 08:01:34,130
the 300 bits a German doing college assignments to stream is the best longtime fan from Canada

2619
08:01:46,290 --> 08:01:49,729

2633
08:03:52,279 --> 08:03:56,919
stream but you have to play it on stream have to remember how fun the sorcery streams were

2634
08:03:56,919 --> 08:04:13,000
you have to do it I mean when you say when you say can you bring sorcery to this I mean

2635
08:04:13,959 --> 08:04:21,520
you're kind of comparing you I mean I don't know I you're comparing like Mozart to something

2636
08:04:21,520 --> 08:04:32,279
is this is this is as good as Mozart I that's tricky this do you tell me disco lcm is the

2637
08:04:32,279 --> 08:04:40,849
equivalent of being as good as sorcery which is the Mozart of these games you have to look into

2638
08:04:40,849 --> 08:04:48,099
that it's a bold statement you're gonna put Sean sunships in f-tier thanks to 250 everyone keep
