I got those uh, those things they only seem to sell at movie theaters. They got snow caps

8
00:01:23,609 --> 00:01:29,340
It's like a little chocolate with the crunchy sugary snow on the on the side. They're disgusting but they only sell them here

videos

16
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:16,919
So some of them are ranging from 10 seconds to two minutes. It's pretty much like a 40, you know, 40 40 10

17
00:02:18,199 --> 00:02:19,960
50 50 ish

18
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:24,550

19
00:02:25,349 --> 00:02:28,389
Uh, we may be here for a while. It might be a three hour stream

20
00:02:28,469 --> 00:02:31,110
It might be it's like a four to five hour stream. I don't know

21
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:37,590
We might get halfway through and need a break because this is this is just like shit post sunday today

22
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:41,639
If your submission did not make it into this movie night

23
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:48,840
Do not think that the submission was bad or sucked or wasn't good enough. It just didn't fit the criteria for tonight, you know

24
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:55,240
There were a lot of submissions and some of them may you know may have been

25
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:59,479
All of them were screened, right? So some of them may have been too loud or

26
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:07,479
Just blasting music or too copyright or maybe maybe not copyright enough on some of them. I'm kidding on that last one

27
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:12,740
Uh, but there was some small, you know, I I we had to keep this one

34
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:41,610

284
00:36:50,679 --> 00:36:56,219
When you key somebody into a scene and there's a car that guy looked like he was in the back seat

285

So it was fine. It didn't look like I was superimposed over him. That's well well done. All right, here we go

With this game what's with the kazoos in the background each of those characters is a god of a gamer seriously

01:29:47,189 --> 01:29:51,590
It just works. It just works metal gear solid cheese and eater

We're just watching somebody's youtube video

660

Others a ghost who never quite fit in

778
01:49:50,760 --> 01:49:54,800

He'd reject me

784
01:50:39,840 --> 01:50:42,399
