1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:11,179
Yes, yes, really. Yeah, I know I told you that it probably wasn't gonna happen today, but I'm full of surprises, aren't I?

2
00:00:11,179 --> 00:00:26,620
Hi guys. Uh, yeah, we're gonna try. There's been some strange happenings over the last few days, and I'm not gonna stream just yet.

3
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:32,920
I'm gonna make sure this is gonna work. So we're gonna hang out here for like five to ten minutes and see what happens.

4
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:43,299
If we're still green, like solid green, uh, heck yeah. Sounds like a plan. Telephone hangout stream.

5
00:00:43,299 --> 00:00:50,119
No, I actually have something that I've been really looking forward to playing, but we're not gonna show that yet.

6
00:00:50,119 --> 00:00:56,119
It's the title, it's in the stream title. Why do I think there's some type of curtain I can drop here?

7
00:00:56,119 --> 00:01:02,420
Well, I'm not gonna tell you what the game is, I'm gonna make it be a surprise. It's the title of the stream and it's the game category.

8
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:17,349
But, just make sure we got it. Yeah, we're good. Is it Resident Evil? No, it is. Oh, maybe some of you guys haven't refreshed.

9
00:01:17,349 --> 00:01:29,959
Would you look at that? Looks like some of you guys might not have refreshed. Is it Bookworm Adventures? No.

10
00:01:29,959 --> 00:01:45,290
It is Africa. The game Africa. This is a rare PlayStation 3 game. Let's hope it's worth the $50 I spent on it.

11
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:56,209
Because it's rare. That doesn't mean good, but okay. We're gonna be playing a rare one tonight.

12
00:01:56,209 --> 00:02:00,640
Yeah, I'll give you a quick little sneak peek. How does that sound? Getting down, look at that.

13
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:11,159
Okay, back to the intro. Oops. Well, now it's, now it's just playing, isn't it? I probably should turn that off.

14
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:21,949
Uh, this is a game where you take photos. That's the whole game. It's Pokemon Snap, but real life. It's a real life Pokemon Snap.

15
00:02:21,949 --> 00:02:32,289
You gotta get perfect angles. And this is the game we're gonna play today.

16
00:02:32,289 --> 00:02:41,949
Uh, because I don't want to start the vibe. And I know what some of you were thinking. That I'm, I'm Pikachu socks-ing everybody here.

17
00:02:41,949 --> 00:02:48,949
And that I'm a liar, and I don't, let me just go, let me make sure, like, we're gonna see lots of Pogchamps in the chat, because this is like a year in the making.

18
00:02:48,949 --> 00:02:58,860
I, I finally own this. Just so people understand. That this is not a Pikachu sock scenario.

19
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:06,800
There it is. There's the vibe. It's real. I didn't make this out of, like, plastic and cardboard and shit. I mean, I could've, it's real.

20
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:12,800
It's here. It's so, it's set up. And, uh, that's what I thought I was gonna be doing over the, like, the next three, four days.

21
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:25,330
Unfortunately, that didn't happen. Internet was all fucked up. We had a lot of issues. Uh, and I'm gonna give Cox the benefit of the doubt on this one.

22
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:34,509
I know, I hate to say that. But the weather here has been fucking crazy. We've been getting, like, 60 plus mile per hour winds.

23
00:03:34,509 --> 00:03:42,509
Uh, like enough to take trees down and stuff. And it's been record rainfall. We had a shitload of rain.

24
00:03:42,509 --> 00:03:54,680
So I, I, I, maybe the, the anger was misdirected. Potentially. I don't know. We have not dropped a single frame yet today.

25
00:03:54,680 --> 00:04:02,680
Uh, there was a weird bandwidth problem me and Italics were having. So me and Italics are trying to work through these weird issues that we keep having with this company.

26
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:09,680
But, uh, I don't see any dropped frames at all in about five minutes. So I think I can stop stalling.

27
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:20,699
I don't know. Should I? Should I make a tweet and say that the stream is on? I think, I don't wanna jinx it.

28
00:04:20,699 --> 00:04:32,670
Because the last stream from this place, uh, was actually Italics. And that was, like, what, two days ago? And he dropped, like, 30, 40,000 frames.

29
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:42,750
So, look, I, I don't wanna jinx it. But, you know, let's go. I've been wanting to stream for, like, three days.

30
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:50,879
I've got so much shit you guys have no idea. We've got Africa. The whole continent is here. In my house.

31
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:58,889
We got all the vive shit. This room is, this room is vivified. I vived it two days ago.

32
00:04:58,889 --> 00:05:06,399
We got Space Channel 5 Part 1. We got, I bought a shitload more PlayStation 2 games. I'm ready to go.

33
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:13,470
And I gotta get out of here. So I'll see you tomorrow. No. All right. Let me just make a tweet. Then we can play, uh, Africa.

34
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:19,990
Metro Exodus just released. But I didn't play Last Light. I can't just play Exodus.

35
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:27,290
You can't watch Star Wars Episode 4 and then skip to Episode 6 if you've never seen them before.

36
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:30,600
They would be like, why would you do that? You have so many questions.

37
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:41,339
All right. I think we're good to go. Oh, boy. The whip dis- I got some good news for the house here today.

38
00:05:41,339 --> 00:05:49,160
No drop frames in five minutes? That is beyond recognizable to us recently. Let me see here.

39
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:55,839
Because it was fucking bright red like an hour ago. This is weird. What a fucking weird technology.

40
00:05:55,839 --> 00:06:03,689
All right. But I was told it was going to get fixed today. That's what I was told.

41
00:06:03,689 --> 00:06:11,829
Anyway, let's go ahead and tweet that. I'll go ahead and get this off so you can take a look at this fun intro with like the lizard.

42
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:22,939
I think the stalling can end. You need audio too, don't you? You'll get it in a second.

43
00:06:22,939 --> 00:06:35,069
So if you end up hearing, which you probably will, there's probably going to be a scenario where it sounds like my house is going to fall over because of the wind.

44
00:06:35,069 --> 00:06:42,310
It's supposed to keep going over into midnight tonight. So you will hear like my room is being microwaved.

45
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:49,939
That's the sound it makes. That's the only way it can compare it to. There it is.

46
00:06:49,939 --> 00:07:06,120
All right. I just tweeted it. That means it's real. Let's go. Get that audio on. I turned it on right when it stopped.

47
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:13,310
All right. We need to test something here. How are there already seven clips of this spring?

48
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:19,560
Did somebody, did you accidentally press the clip it button and you're like, oh shit, hopefully nobody saw that.

49
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:26,870
All right. Let's make sure that's synced up. All we can do is new game. So new game.

50
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:38,000
And there's the MGM lion. We are currently auto saving. Again, if you're just joining us.

51
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:44,000
This is the rarest PlayStation 3 game that exists in North America. It was five hundred dollars.

52
00:07:44,000 --> 00:08:15,089
So, I mean, hopefully we get to play it. Is that the real win? What's going on here?

53
00:08:15,089 --> 00:08:19,839
Do I have to like reset this game? I thought you're never supposed to do this.

54
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:23,839
Aren't you not supposed to ever do this with ever got any console ever?

55
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:36,600
I can't turn the console off. That's the number one cardinal sin is turning off your console during a save.

56
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:41,279
And this is like italics. Let me borrow this. I'm going to break his PlayStation 3.

57
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:49,600
What am I going to do about this? What if I like wipe? What if he's got some like saves on here that are really important?

58
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:56,360
I just looked it up. It's fifty dollars for a used copy. Yes, it is.

59
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:13,570
I don't. What's wrong with this? The disk is perfect. The disk is perfect.

60
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:23,149
This is not even. This is almost like factory new. Now, something just fucked up there.

61
00:09:23,149 --> 00:09:37,330
Was there like a glitch? We're good. We're good. Everybody calmed down. Let's try it again.

62
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:49,289
It's broken and not used. He's actually microwaving his room. Somebody microwaved the room.

63
00:09:49,289 --> 00:09:53,659
I don't know. Somebody went on to, you know, you know, every room has a fucking panel.

64
00:09:53,659 --> 00:09:58,720
Every microwave. I don't know what I meant to say is every microwave has the panel.

65
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:04,809
Somebody put on like five seconds and impressed it. Let's try again.

66
00:10:04,809 --> 00:10:43,659
Well, the Internet works in that spectacular. OK, told you I told you I wasn't supposed to do that.

67
00:10:43,659 --> 00:10:46,659
Don't tell them. Don't tell them. Let me be the one that tells them.

68
00:10:46,659 --> 00:10:59,629
Let me be the one that tells them. Let me be the one that tells them.

69
00:10:59,629 --> 00:11:03,629
I can't fucking believe it. I just wanted to play Africa and take photos.

70
00:11:03,629 --> 00:11:19,370
What did I do? What happened? How do I even do that? How do I delete that?

71
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:39,700
How do you delete save data? He's watching. I don't understand what happened.

72
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:56,850
I'm going to delete the save data for. OK, that's good. Let's let's hold on.

73
00:11:56,850 --> 00:12:14,320
I'm going to do it again and see what happens. I'm so like sad right now.

74
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:19,879
I didn't even do anything. I just put a game disc in the PlayStation.

75
00:12:19,879 --> 00:12:25,840
That didn't. I don't think that did. No, don't worry.

76
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:37,009
It didn't delete everything. It didn't delete everything. It only deleted Africa. I hope.

77
00:12:37,009 --> 00:12:42,360
Do not see. That's what I'm telling you guys.

78
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,360
Everyone was telling me that I should have done that.

79
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:50,559
Fucking autosave. When is I going to come up with an autosave that doesn't fucking brick your entire...

80
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:56,470
Let's do it. Do it. Let's go. Autosave. Party the fuck up.

81
00:12:56,470 --> 00:13:06,039
What is what is happening right now? I'm going to leave it for a second.

82
00:13:06,039 --> 00:13:16,710
I'm impatient. It shouldn't take this long. Just wait. Just wait. OK.

83
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:35,269
I'm an impatient boomer. I don't know, man. After after two to three straight minutes.

84
00:13:35,269 --> 00:13:43,269
It might have to delete all the local content. No, I can't do that.

85
00:13:43,269 --> 00:13:55,769
OK. It takes a long time to load a whole continent.

86
00:13:55,769 --> 00:14:03,450
I'm going to give this another two minutes. I just got to wipe his hard drive.

87
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:24,519
Try unplugging it now. If I have to factory reset his PlayStation.

88
00:14:24,519 --> 00:14:28,850
What do you mean Google it? It takes that long. What?

89
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:35,929
Oh my God. So I brick this PS3 for no reason.

90
00:14:35,929 --> 00:14:44,879
It has a three hundred and eighty seven megabyte save file.

91
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:49,570
Why does it have a four hundred meg save file?

92
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:58,039
OK. Well, sorry. It's Alex. I may have brick to your saves.

93
00:14:58,039 --> 00:15:01,039
It's all right. You can make a new team as those character.

94
00:15:01,039 --> 00:15:07,259
It's all right. Don't worry. I'm sorry. Music volume in midnight mode.

95
00:15:07,259 --> 00:15:13,279
I don't have that. Can we get the Jurassic Park music down a little bit?

96
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:16,279
No, I'll keep it up. No, that's too much.

97
00:15:16,279 --> 00:15:26,940
Two two ticks down. It is the look. How many times?

98
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:31,179
OK, thank God. It was going to be like five minutes every time.

99
00:15:31,179 --> 00:15:33,179
This is an incredibly poorly optimized.

100
00:15:33,179 --> 00:15:37,179
Learn all about Africa and its animals. All right.

101
00:15:37,179 --> 00:15:41,929
Read about any animals you've discovered in Safari mode.

102
00:15:41,929 --> 00:15:49,360
We're going to get default unlockables, which is bugs, shrimp and tigers.

103
00:15:49,360 --> 00:16:01,870
So at least we'll have the defaults. So zebra.

104
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:07,000
I told you we're going to get those. Let's learn. Let's learn about the zebra.

105
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
This is the rarest PlayStation 3 game in North America.

106
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,309
This was five hundred dollars. You understand?

107
00:16:14,309 --> 00:16:21,799
Let's go. A 3D view profile.

108
00:16:21,799 --> 00:16:28,070
Look at this. There's even video. There's even.

109
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:31,500
Never mind. This 3D view.

110
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:39,909
That's what an adult looks like. What about a baby?

111
00:16:39,909 --> 00:16:42,909
I have not found the baby yet. We've got to take a picture of everything.

112
00:16:42,909 --> 00:16:46,149
Planes or virtual zebras are Africa's most common zebra species.

113
00:16:46,149 --> 00:16:49,149
They can be distinguished from other species by their unique pattern of stripes,

114
00:16:49,149 --> 00:16:51,149
which are wide and widely spaced.

115
00:16:51,149 --> 00:16:56,149
As in all zebra species, the stripes are thought to help visually distract potential predators.

116
00:16:56,149 --> 00:17:02,539
So that's top right. That's what the zebra.

117
00:17:02,539 --> 00:17:07,539
That's the male and female. I guess maybe the female stands up on two legs.

118
00:17:07,539 --> 00:17:15,680
Interesting. Wears shoes too.

119
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:21,130
New record. Four to four and a half feet at the shoulder.

120
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:24,130
And they weigh four hundred eighty five to seven hundred seventy five.

121
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:28,400
Music's too loud. And we got fifty fucking subs just came in.

122
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,569
Fifty of them. That's right. Five hundred community subs.

123
00:17:32,569 --> 00:17:35,569
What is going on? No. Oh my god. Fifty and then ten.

124
00:17:35,569 --> 00:17:39,569
Great Canadian Fuck Club gave six thousand dollars worth of subs right there.

125
00:17:39,569 --> 00:17:42,569
Whatever it was. Thank you so much, dude. That's a shitload.

126
00:17:42,569 --> 00:17:49,029
Whiff whiffs. I gave ten. Great Canadians back.

127
00:17:49,029 --> 00:17:56,029
All right. That's cool. I mean, no, but that is cool.

128
00:17:56,029 --> 00:18:00,420
I'm talking about like the game. That's cool. This is cool.

129
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:08,930
That's a lot of fucking money. Fifty gifted subs is two, three.

130
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:12,930
That's two hundred and fifty bucks. My god.

131
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:15,809
Thanks for the three at all. It's cool. I guess.

132
00:18:15,809 --> 00:18:23,380
And yes, I understand. I'm going real slow. It's been 20 minutes.

133
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:26,750
But I have to make sure that this Internet is going to work.

134
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:30,750
This is the rarest fucking PlayStation 3 game.

135
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:33,750
I ain't going to turn this on and get turned off in five seconds.

136
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:38,160
Ten community subs from Multi Trip. Thank you, Multi Trip.

137
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:47,589
Shut the fuck up about that shitty joke. It's not a joke.

138
00:18:47,589 --> 00:18:53,220
Look it up. Go look it up.

139
00:18:53,220 --> 00:19:00,259
Kairatobi, ten community subs. Thank you so much, Kairatobi.

140
00:19:00,259 --> 00:19:05,910
That's like eighty community subs right now.

141
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:16,099
You guys are fucking incredible. All right, we're going to make our license here.

142
00:19:16,099 --> 00:19:21,490
OK, let's see. Eric, age 27 from France.

143
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:25,490
Or Anna, 24 from the USA.

144
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:30,920
I mean, I can't. I mean, USA.

145
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:37,720
Occupation zoologist.

146
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:51,000
Journalist. I'm picking zoologist.

147
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:57,880
And USA. New name.

148
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:03,799
Anna, forty-six dollars.

149
00:20:03,799 --> 00:20:08,480
It's not a joke. How about...

150
00:20:13,809 --> 00:20:28,220
Photo. Focus.

151
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:32,220
Exposure. Exposure? No, no, no, no.

152
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:36,829
Focus. Lens.

153
00:20:36,829 --> 00:20:40,829
Laura Lens. No, that's like a fourth grade

154
00:20:40,829 --> 00:20:43,829
ABC mouse character. No, no, no, no.

155
00:20:43,829 --> 00:20:49,140
Telephoto. Tele...

156
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:54,519
Telephana. Telephana. Telephana.

157
00:20:54,519 --> 00:21:00,549
Aperture. That's pretty good. Telephana.

158
00:21:00,549 --> 00:21:07,839
Aperture Anna. No, but that's like Aperture Science.

159
00:21:07,839 --> 00:21:18,980
Tele... Laura, ten community subs from

160
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:22,980
Winterly Parsley. Winterly Parsley, thank you so much for ten subs.

161
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:30,400
Thank you. God damn it, there's so many different

162
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:34,400
interesting names. I like Laura... I don't care. Lens Laura.

163
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:40,059
Laura through the lens or something. I don't know.

164
00:21:40,059 --> 00:21:48,720
Laura Long Lens. That's a bad name, bad name, bad name.

165
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:57,660
Streamer's not reading chat. Yes, he is.

166
00:21:57,660 --> 00:22:05,039
No, I'm not gonna... I'm gonna name this character something

167
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:09,039
because this character is, believe it or not, and whatever everybody wants to say, this character will be

168
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:13,039
in the next Jerma Rumble. It's important. Every new

169
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:17,039
protagonist that you get in a video game, this character's gonna be in the Jerma Rumble. Has to be.

170
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:28,619
What was that one? Anna Exposure. No.

171
00:22:28,619 --> 00:22:34,720
This is taking too long.

172
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:40,490
Aperture Anna. What does Aperture mean? Focus.

173
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:46,960
Whose name starts with F? Fran? Fran Focus.

174
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:53,039
Fran Focus. I'm done. How do I do uppercase on this computer?

175
00:22:53,039 --> 00:23:00,269
Francine Focus. Yep. Done.

176
00:23:00,269 --> 00:23:16,759
There it is. Francine Focus. How do I go?

177
00:23:16,759 --> 00:23:26,750
How do I make a space? Can I not do a space?

178
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:49,019
That's the maximum name you can have. Okay.

179
00:23:49,019 --> 00:23:55,759
That's Francine. That's fine. Francine Focus.

180
00:23:55,759 --> 00:24:04,200
Look at how beautiful this game is. You didn't want me to play it. You.

181
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:08,200
A245 Fortnite. That guy didn't want me to fucking

182
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:24,640
play. Get him out of here. What? Oh.

183
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:28,640
I thought that was me. We finally arrived at the Manyanga Conservation Area.

184
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:33,130
Okay. Base camp is all set up, so let's start exploring

185
00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:37,130
right away. The game gets it. Who wants to do a tutorial? Who wants to learn everything?

186
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:41,369
Just get us out there into the wild and get the camera in my hands.

187
00:24:41,369 --> 00:24:45,369
Looking forward to working with you, Francine. You too, Eric.

188
00:24:45,369 --> 00:24:49,369
The Jambo Navi interface is all set up on the laptop.

189
00:24:49,369 --> 00:24:53,369
There may be messages from the head office, so you should check your email now.

190
00:24:53,369 --> 00:25:01,200
Just select the laptop PC to use it. Check email, transfer photos from your camera,

191
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:08,430
purchase equipment, and more? Okay. Got email, photo,

192
00:25:08,430 --> 00:25:12,730
gallery, shopping, save. Let's go ahead and get that

193
00:25:12,730 --> 00:25:21,200
out of the way so we don't corrupt it. 387 megabytes.

194
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:31,309
Is this going to take that long to save it every time?

195
00:25:31,309 --> 00:25:45,019
It's going to take like two minutes to save every time. That's

196
00:25:45,019 --> 00:25:49,319
insane. Did they just copy and paste the whole game in a save state?

197
00:25:49,319 --> 00:25:54,759
That might be what this is. Is this game more than 400 meg?

198
00:25:54,759 --> 00:26:07,000
It's 10 years ago. That's not counting photos. So once I start

199
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,000
having like 50 to 100 photos in my library, this is going to be like 5 gig.

200
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:22,480
Saving is going to take like an hour. This is probably why nobody owns it.

201
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:31,559
Maybe. Alright, let's check the email. When your in-game

202
00:26:31,559 --> 00:26:35,559
email, pretend email, is faster than your save,

203
00:26:35,559 --> 00:26:39,559
there's something wrong. You could have made that a little longer. Important wildlife research

204
00:26:39,559 --> 00:26:44,000
request. Welcome to the Manyanga Conservation Area. If you

205
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,000
are the first to research Manyanga, so we need you to start by documenting

206
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,000
the animals that live here. Anytime you see a new animal, take a picture of it

207
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,000
and send it by replying to this email. Then we can send you

208
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:06,039
new photo assignments for that animal. Bits? We got big bits?

209
00:27:06,039 --> 00:27:14,809
Holy shit, we did have big bits. A hundred dollars.

210
00:27:14,809 --> 00:27:21,869
Thank you for the hundred bucks. G-Y-H-D-H-F-E.

211
00:27:21,869 --> 00:27:25,869
Based on your responses to my questions, I've determined that you

212
00:27:25,869 --> 00:27:29,869
would be impotent, asexual or answers of a

213
00:27:29,869 --> 00:27:33,869
beta male. Also, your responses on my fetish question, I've determined

214
00:27:33,869 --> 00:27:37,869
you to be a person with really fucked up fetishes because if a person doesn't express his fetishes

215
00:27:37,869 --> 00:27:41,869
online, he's really fucked up and he can't reveal. This is way out of all of this

216
00:27:41,869 --> 00:27:45,869
however you have to answer this question or else it's a valid place to. Have you tried? I'm not going to read that out loud.

217
00:27:45,869 --> 00:27:50,940
Okay, I got two things

218
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:54,940
to ask you there. Two questions. I got a question for

219
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:58,940
you. Here's question number- let's get this out of the way. Question

220
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:04,589
number one for you. Why do you care so much about my sexuality?

221
00:28:04,589 --> 00:28:08,589
Isn't that my business? You know what I mean? Ain't that like my business?

222
00:28:08,589 --> 00:28:14,730
You know what I'm saying? Question number two for you. Equally

223
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:30,349
is important. No, it is ours. What?

224
00:28:30,349 --> 00:28:34,349
I'm in a very happy relationship with

225
00:28:34,349 --> 00:28:38,349
someone named Kim. She's my girlfriend.

226
00:28:38,349 --> 00:28:48,779
Got a healthy relationship. That's all you need to know.

227
00:28:48,779 --> 00:28:52,779
I'm not going to answer the question at the end of that because that's not appropriate

228
00:28:52,779 --> 00:28:56,779
for me to say on a live stream of me taking pictures of animals

229
00:28:56,779 --> 00:29:01,400
in Africa. Okay? If this was like a

230
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:05,400
podcast- let's talk about appropriate shit here. If I was doing a podcast

231
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:10,160
about sexual shit

232
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:17,789
alright, yeah, but I'm about to take a picture of a zebra. What is the

233
00:29:17,789 --> 00:29:26,569
context of this conversation? We can't even get to the animals at this

234
00:29:26,569 --> 00:29:36,559
rate. Anyways, no, you can't just like

235
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:40,559
alright, I'm going to make one more point here. You can't- okay,

236
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:44,559
if someone's coming out of a coffee shop, let's say Brad Pitt

237
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:48,559
was coming out of a coffee shop, right? Yeah, it's Brad Pitt.

238
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:52,559
You know him, you've seen his movies. And you run up to Brad Pitt

239
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:56,559
there's a bunch of people taking pictures of him and he's like

240
00:29:56,559 --> 00:30:00,559
oh no, no photos today please. I've got pictures of zebras to take.

241
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:04,559
And they're like, okay, yeah, you run fucking through the crowd

242
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:08,559
and you like run in there and you're like, hey, have you ever tried to

243
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:14,759
blank your own blank? He's going to be like, what the fuck are you talking about?

244
00:30:14,759 --> 00:30:29,289
He's going to be like, is he going to walk away?

245
00:30:29,289 --> 00:30:34,240
Comparing yourself to Brad Pitt. I mean, this is 3,300 people here.

246
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:40,400
How many people have seen Brad Pitt's movies? Maybe like

247
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:44,400
5-10,000? He gets like 5-10,000 concurrent viewers on his movies.

248
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:54,839
I think I'm in like a similar category, I think. Thank you for the 100 bucks

249
00:30:54,839 --> 00:31:01,630
though. Alright, we had 50 fucking dollars

250
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:10,089
from ChunkyBeloney. ChunkyBeloney thanks for $50.02.

251
00:31:10,089 --> 00:31:14,089
Here's a nice cheer to get the taste of the last one out of your mouth. Happy Friday. You've been streaming

252
00:31:14,089 --> 00:31:18,089
for 30 minutes and managed to save and name your character.

253
00:31:18,089 --> 00:31:25,980
This is the ultimate stall stream. Don't you

254
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:29,980
understand? Things that Jerma says

255
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:33,980
500 times a stream. Don't you understand? This is something you gotta understand.

256
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:42,190
You understand? This is something you guys gotta understand. Okay.

257
00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:48,970
No, seriously, thank you both of you. 150 bucks. I need to take a picture

258
00:31:48,970 --> 00:31:52,970
of a, what am I taking a picture of? I'm going to get 3,000 concurrent

259
00:31:52,970 --> 00:31:59,259
viewers. I already have that. Alright, I, I, I, let's go.

260
00:31:59,259 --> 00:32:03,259
Take a picture of it and send, anytime you see a new animal, take a picture of it and send it to my email.

261
00:32:03,259 --> 00:32:10,490
You got it. So difficulty is

262
00:32:10,490 --> 00:32:14,490
level one. Just get, let's go. Let's go take some photos. Let's go.

263
00:32:14,490 --> 00:32:20,079
A draw request already came in, did it? Just start by taking a picture of each type of animal

264
00:32:20,079 --> 00:32:24,250
that you see. Francine, this is for you. A

265
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:30,589
Tsetse type F. It's my first camera.

266
00:32:30,589 --> 00:32:35,710
And binoculars. And a GPS map. The camera case is

267
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:42,619
over there. F for Francine. I put the tools in the

268
00:32:42,619 --> 00:32:46,990
cases next to the bookshelf. I'd like to go too, but I need to sort out

269
00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:50,990
our equipment. Can you go with the guide, James?

270
00:32:50,990 --> 00:32:55,480
He should be waiting just outside. Oh, the guy's name is James. I was like, what the hell are you talking about?

271
00:32:55,480 --> 00:33:00,799
Have a safe trip. Okay. So let's go into the camera case.

272
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:05,470
Make sure that's equipped. Yep, view cameras and lenses. We've got

273
00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:10,539
the type F. Body is type F, that's all I got. There's multiple

274
00:33:10,539 --> 00:33:18,220
bodies, multiple lenses. I don't think I can do anything else.

275
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:22,650
New tools, they're already equipped. Yep, binoculars, GPS map. Use with the

276
00:33:22,650 --> 00:33:27,210
R1 button. Use with select. Good thing I looked at that, otherwise I would have been

277
00:33:27,210 --> 00:33:34,460
like, don't even explain our flight. Exit base camp.

278
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:48,039
Tsetse. Tsetse. It's your birthday today.

279
00:33:48,039 --> 00:34:00,059
You know it's on the way. We should be way

280
00:34:00,059 --> 00:34:04,059
more excited about something else. Zero drop frames.

281
00:34:04,059 --> 00:34:10,119
Maybe they fixed it. I don't know, I'm not going to be... I can't say that's

282
00:34:10,119 --> 00:34:18,320
going to happen. We're at Duma Step. Okay.

283
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:22,320
Jumbo Francine. Welcome to the Manyanga Conservation Area.

284
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:26,320
I'll drive the car, Francine. Go ahead and make yourself comfortable in the backseat.

285
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:33,420
I have to take pictures of animals, right? We're going to get like a monster

286
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:39,449
hunter now. Where's the...

287
00:34:39,449 --> 00:34:43,449
The Kulu Yaku?

288
00:34:43,449 --> 00:34:48,079
What's the bird's name? The bird with the egg? Hippo Pool.

289
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:57,099
This is the Hippo Pool. Yeah, well I would have driven

290
00:34:57,099 --> 00:35:02,300
another like five feet up there. Nobody is home right now, but Hippo's

291
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:06,670
off and bathe here. Yeah, I know that. I've played the game before. Drive.

292
00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:10,670
Wrong way. Wrong way, idiot. Like fucking idiot. Doesn't even know where he's going.

293
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:19,949
You know I've done this before. You know that? Hello? You know I've

294
00:35:19,949 --> 00:35:28,219
done this. I drive over here. You're going the wrong way. Just turn around.

295
00:35:28,219 --> 00:35:32,909
Wow, you like went into the ditch for a second. What a fucking idiot.

296
00:35:32,909 --> 00:35:38,489
God, how does this person have 3,000 viewers? I don't understand. Am I supposed to be

297
00:35:38,489 --> 00:35:46,250
taking pictures? How do I take pictures? How do I take

298
00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:50,429
a photo? Is this just like teaching you that they are okay? Here we go. Not many animals here.

299
00:35:50,429 --> 00:35:54,429
There's a shitload of animals here. That bird's coming down and swooping down and going to get us.

300
00:35:54,429 --> 00:35:59,820
Let's try a Wily Oasis. When there's water, there's life,

301
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:06,039
right? Blind. There are no animals. Wow,

302
00:36:06,039 --> 00:36:10,039
a blind streamer. Can't even see the fucking animal in front of him. He's pretending.

303
00:36:10,039 --> 00:36:16,329
He has to be. Yeah, I don't know man. Like seriously? Like how do you

304
00:36:16,329 --> 00:36:20,329
not see that? There were clearly three or four deer in front of him and he just doesn't see

305
00:36:20,329 --> 00:36:24,829
them? I just don't get it. He needs to start paying the fuck attention to stuff. It's pissing

306
00:36:24,829 --> 00:36:35,849
me off lately. That's the Wily Oasis. Yeah.

307
00:36:35,849 --> 00:36:46,670
Just like I said, plenty of animals here. Oh, let's get a giraffe. Too far

308
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:50,670
to see? Try the binoculars. Press R1 button to use the binoculars.

309
00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:57,530
Oh, whoops. It could get a bit bumpy, so hang on. Oh, I can't wait to see how

310
00:36:57,530 --> 00:37:03,440
badly he drives. Come on, streamer. He actually just

311
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:10,679
has to dash into that. Alright, we can find the perfect one. Look at that. Planes, zebras.

312
00:37:10,679 --> 00:37:16,519
I would laugh my ass off if he fucking runs into one. Look, they're

313
00:37:16,519 --> 00:37:26,380
what? What about the giraffe? Look at that.

314
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:32,670
Maasai giraffes. Yeah, it was also, what's this one?

315
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:40,159
The little ones. Wily Oasis.

316
00:37:40,159 --> 00:37:47,900
By the way, Francine, do you know how to use the camera? I have

317
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:52,519
no idea. Press the square button to point the camera and press the circle

318
00:37:52,519 --> 00:37:56,519
button or R1 to shoot. This one right to the right is looking like

319
00:37:56,519 --> 00:38:00,519
prime picture material. They're right in front of the bush.

320
00:38:00,519 --> 00:38:09,289
Why don't you try it out now? Point the camera and then snap a picture. How do I zoom in?

321
00:38:09,289 --> 00:38:30,139
No, that's not good enough. Where's the truck? Where's the truck?

322
00:38:30,139 --> 00:38:37,630
Okay, I don't know where the truck went. Got it, got it, got it, got it, got it, got it.

323
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:46,780
Check your photos in the field menu. Press the triangle button to open the

324
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:54,400
field menu. Photos. That one's, look at how beautiful that is.

325
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:58,889
A little blurry, but it's alright. That's a pretty good

326
00:38:58,889 --> 00:39:04,599
calendar photo, I would say. Tools, missions, look like I could.

327
00:39:04,599 --> 00:39:08,599
Try taking some pictures up close. Press X button to exit the car. But please don't

328
00:39:08,599 --> 00:39:13,929
stray too far from the car. Good luck. Snapshots of plenty of animals.

329
00:39:13,929 --> 00:39:19,070
You're not gonna like leave me, are you? I can actually walk around?

330
00:39:19,070 --> 00:39:47,719
How did that one come up? That zebra.

331
00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:59,440
Okay, uh, what if I just took like a fucking... Oh, come on!

332
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:03,800
I pressed the wrong button. Come on, do something, do it again.

333
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:18,590
No, I gotta take pictures of like animals. No, you scare them if you get too... Okay,

334
00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:23,920
I got zebras, I need giraffe. Is it like a sneak button? What's like

335
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:27,920
the stealth kill button? And I don't mean like the stealth kill button, I mean like the stealth

336
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:31,920
button that makes you creep down and do the... Like, hold on, just quiet.

337
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:42,409
There's one right here. No, I gotta get closer than that. God damn it.

338
00:40:42,409 --> 00:40:52,730
What are those little guys called? Francine, don't wander too far, it's dangerous.

339
00:40:52,730 --> 00:40:58,360
Can I get like fucking eaten by a lion? Come on, come on!

340
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:14,159
That was the wrong button. It's circle.

341
00:41:14,159 --> 00:41:26,320
I keep thinking it's X. Okay, there's the giraffe.

342
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:38,239
Get one close. I mean, I can't get that close to a giraffe, guys. Not bad.

343
00:41:38,239 --> 00:41:45,150
I gotta get the little ones. There they are. Okay, let's get up there.

344
00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:49,710
Right next to this tree. Can I get it? Come on. I gotta get away.

345
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:58,619
Don't run away! Stop! Ah! Here we go. It's gonna be patient.

346
00:41:58,619 --> 00:42:05,340
You're gonna pop up from behind the bush. Beautiful. Oh,

347
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:14,380
excellent job. That's it. Tutorial mission passed.

348
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:24,119
You have to crouch to enter sneak mode. Oh, I don't know how to crouch. No.

349
00:42:24,119 --> 00:42:33,289
Wasted film. Baby giraffe look like adult giraffe, but just get the

350
00:42:33,289 --> 00:42:42,960
rhino. Where's the rhino? I gotta get back in the car

351
00:42:42,960 --> 00:43:03,949
to get the rhino. What about that? Is that a zebra? Yeah.

352
00:43:03,949 --> 00:43:11,000
That's great that they actually pose, though. Let's go back to base camp. Let's review the photos

353
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:18,190
and do the tutorial. I might get a couple of action shots here. This might be good.

354
00:43:18,190 --> 00:43:31,559
Where's the rhino? Looking for a rhino? Come on. Something crazy is gonna happen.

355
00:43:31,559 --> 00:43:40,280
He doesn't know where the rhino is. I'll get the rhino eventually.

356
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:46,960
I'm not operating the car. Maybe I get to drive the car eventually. I would assume. Probably can, right?

357
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:56,360
What are those? Lining the shot up?

358
00:43:56,360 --> 00:44:04,809
Are those just regular horses? What are those?

359
00:44:04,809 --> 00:44:20,599
Got ya. Gazelles. Horses. I don't know.

360
00:44:20,599 --> 00:44:28,679
How far away? You couldn't even tell. This is an on-rail shooter.

361
00:44:28,679 --> 00:44:32,679
Well, only for this portion. You actually get to get out.

362
00:44:32,679 --> 00:44:45,099
Let's review those photos. Send them pictures of the gas tanks.

363
00:44:45,099 --> 00:44:52,409
How was the safari today? Many types of animals live in the area. Good luck tomorrow, too.

364
00:44:52,409 --> 00:44:56,969
There are like 500 animals to take pictures of in this game.

365
00:44:56,969 --> 00:45:05,050
How was it on the field? Find lots of animals? Transfer your photos to JumboNavi.

366
00:45:05,050 --> 00:45:09,050
Also, send the head office a photo of each animal that you took by replying to their email.

367
00:45:09,050 --> 00:45:18,010
Transfer photos.

368
00:45:18,010 --> 00:45:31,070
I have to check the ones that I want to send.

369
00:45:31,070 --> 00:45:36,639
Let's take a look at the view. That one's not bad. I like that one.

370
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:40,639
That one's way better.

371
00:45:40,639 --> 00:45:45,579
That's just a handsome fella, you know what I mean?

372
00:45:45,579 --> 00:45:56,250
This one... no. Wait, what was it? This is so bad.

373
00:45:56,250 --> 00:46:00,250
This is like Grandma with an iPhone. At the Disney one.

374
00:46:00,250 --> 00:46:08,059
I like that one. Good picture, Grandma. This is like in your group chat.

375
00:46:08,059 --> 00:46:14,519
Everybody has one with their family.

376
00:46:14,519 --> 00:46:18,519
And even when you say hide notifications, it doesn't matter. It still pops up.

377
00:46:18,519 --> 00:46:26,349
At the top of your phone. You have to kind of chime in.

378
00:46:26,349 --> 00:46:30,349
Your grandma's in there, so you're going to be like, oh, that's a really cool picture you got there of the turkey.

379
00:46:30,349 --> 00:46:34,349
Yeah, I was at the safari at Disney World.

380
00:46:34,349 --> 00:46:38,349
Let me show you this photo.

381
00:46:38,349 --> 00:46:42,349
You can be on National Geographic with those photos.

382
00:46:42,349 --> 00:46:55,230
That's how it goes every time.

383
00:46:55,230 --> 00:47:00,880
I'm going to take this one. Here's the one I wanted to use. That's a cool zebra.

384
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:07,869
Let's transfer those.

385
00:47:07,869 --> 00:47:24,239
Did I just delete everything?

386
00:47:24,239 --> 00:47:29,239
This is spaced with photos.

387
00:47:29,239 --> 00:47:37,179
I can save them?

388
00:47:37,179 --> 00:47:44,219
We got reply. Send photos.

389
00:47:44,219 --> 00:47:48,650
Did I even pick photos? Oh, here we go.

390
00:47:48,650 --> 00:47:52,889
This is the good one I wanted. Send that one.

391
00:47:52,889 --> 00:47:59,320
Send. Result. Clear.

392
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:03,320
Good angle. Excellent target. Marvelous distance and marvelous technique.

393
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:09,420
$3,000. Animal added to GeoAfrica mode.

394
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:16,510
Thompson's gazelle.

395
00:48:16,510 --> 00:48:20,880
I'm going to send you a picture of the giraffe.

396
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:29,340
It's a bad angle, but it's okay. I'm going to use it.

397
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:34,280
Great angle. Marvelous. Marvelous. Excellent.

398
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:45,369
Look at all the space above the giraffe. This is a bad picture.

399
00:48:45,369 --> 00:48:53,099
Let's do it again.

400
00:48:53,099 --> 00:48:58,039
What if I just send him a picture of my friend giving the thumbs up?

401
00:48:58,039 --> 00:49:03,690
What's he going to do?

402
00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:16,429
This photo. Let's see what they say.

403
00:49:16,429 --> 00:49:23,099
Failed. Sorry.

404
00:49:23,099 --> 00:49:27,099
This bird or this bird? This one's probably more clear.

405
00:49:27,099 --> 00:49:33,119
Even though it's not at all.

406
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:39,449
It is a pretty bad angle, but at least I cleared it with a B.

407
00:49:39,449 --> 00:49:46,110
Lapid-faced vulture.

408
00:49:46,110 --> 00:49:51,420
Let's do the new animal.

409
00:49:51,420 --> 00:49:56,110
What is this of? I don't think I even did the zebras.

410
00:49:56,110 --> 00:50:04,300
Excellent angle. Marvelous. Marvelous. Marvelous.

411
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:11,679
I already did it. So what did I not send?

412
00:50:11,679 --> 00:50:24,429
The other gazelles. Like these. Bad angle.

413
00:50:24,429 --> 00:50:30,829
How do you have good distance?

414
00:50:30,829 --> 00:50:39,920
There's another iPad picture. I have money.

415
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:45,099
I'm going to go on my photo gallery. I'm going to start deleting shit.

416
00:50:45,099 --> 00:50:49,099
Delete this. Delete. Delete. Delete. Wait. Keep that one.

417
00:50:49,099 --> 00:51:00,360
I think we already got them. We got them all.

418
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:04,360
Maybe I can get a better angle on Turkey. Whatever the hell this thing is.

419
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:09,949
Because that is a vulture too, right? Maybe I'll get a better grade.

420
00:51:09,949 --> 00:51:26,199
We improved the grade. Let's see what the save is now.

421
00:51:26,199 --> 00:51:31,400
308. I have to do it. No we don't. Not yet.

422
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:38,320
What do I have for money? Photo frame. Photo storage.

423
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:42,320
That's all I have unlocked right now. $48,000

424
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:46,750
for a photo storage device. $68,000 for a photo frame.

425
00:51:46,750 --> 00:51:52,760
That's kind of ridiculous.

426
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:56,760
Transfer photos to laptop PC to free up space on your camera.

427
00:51:56,760 --> 00:52:01,199
As long as there's room your photos will be automatically transferred when you use the PC.

428
00:52:01,199 --> 00:52:05,199
By the way, I prepared a map of the area. We can fill the map out as we discover new areas.

429
00:52:05,199 --> 00:52:09,440
Great first day out there. Let's rest up and get an early start tomorrow.

430
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:24,920
Time for bed.

431
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:28,920
Oh, I'll leave the survey log on the bookshelf. You may want to review it from time to time.

432
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:34,380
What do you mean like right now?

433
00:52:38,380 --> 00:52:42,380
The grandma joke in the group chat is going to be a reality.

434
00:52:42,380 --> 00:52:49,500
Survey log. This is the log of the progress of the survey of the

435
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:54,380
Mannyanga conservation area.

436
00:52:56,380 --> 00:53:03,690
Camera lingo. Camera shake. Basic photography.

437
00:53:03,690 --> 00:53:09,599
Okay, remaining image. Make sure I know what this is going on. Left stick is angle.

438
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:15,760
Right stick up and down. Wait a minute.

439
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:20,440
Today's advice. If you think your photo is good, chances are it is.

440
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:25,840
Type F. We don't need to know about that. Camera shake.

441
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:29,840
Let's talk about a nasty little problem that can wreck your hard-won photos.

442
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:33,840
You guessed it. Camera shake. If your hands jiggle while you snap the picture, your photos are blurred.

443
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:38,079
Increase the shutter speed or try pressing the shutter

444
00:53:38,079 --> 00:53:43,280
more gently. So that's why these pictures have been shitty.

445
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:48,570
Shooting vertically. What?

446
00:53:48,570 --> 00:53:52,570
Vertical photos are fun to take. No they're not. This is like every

447
00:53:52,570 --> 00:53:56,570
photographer will tell you that don't ever take a photo with your iPhone. Vertical.

448
00:53:56,570 --> 00:54:01,260
I guess this is like a nice iPhone though. From the viewfinder, try holding

449
00:54:01,260 --> 00:54:08,679
the controller in a vertical position.

450
00:54:08,679 --> 00:54:14,329
I don't even know if I can do that with this controller.

451
00:54:14,329 --> 00:54:19,280
Pictures you take are saved to your photo storage. All your photos go to the same storage.

452
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:26,199
So even if you change cameras, you'll have the same number of shots remaining.

453
00:54:26,199 --> 00:54:30,199
Dirty shots in the storage. If you want to take more, you need to import some of your photos into the John Blanavia or

454
00:54:30,199 --> 00:54:36,880
let's delete to clear up space.

455
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:44,510
My survey begins.

456
00:54:44,510 --> 00:54:48,510
This is your player record. Total time played, day of survey, photos taken, missions cleared.

457
00:54:48,510 --> 00:54:53,000
My ranking is Vervet Monkey.

458
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:57,500
This is going to be fun. Let's do it. How do I do anything?

459
00:54:57,500 --> 00:55:03,150
Alright, Eric.

460
00:55:03,150 --> 00:55:07,769
What about the map? The map of the locations you've explored.

461
00:55:07,769 --> 00:55:15,599
Look at all this. Look at all that up there.

462
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:20,090
There's so much. I'm going to beat this whole game today.

463
00:55:20,090 --> 00:55:24,090
Well no I'm not, but I'll play for a while. Hippo Pool Base Camp. We've got to go to the Hippo Pool, right?

464
00:55:24,090 --> 00:55:28,909
Base Camp Hippo Pool. Closest water source from Base Camp.

465
00:55:28,909 --> 00:55:33,400
Favorite spot for Hippopotamus. Hippopotamus is

466
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:38,670
a fucking dangerous though. They're the most vicious animal on Earth.

467
00:55:38,670 --> 00:55:45,579
Alright, let's see. Any new emails? I do.

468
00:55:45,579 --> 00:55:50,269
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa. Alright, research. Herd of...

469
00:55:50,269 --> 00:55:54,440
We need a herd of gazelles. Hi Francie, nice to meet you.

470
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:58,440
Since you're doing research on the Duma step, I had a favor to ask you. Are you familiar with an animal called the

471
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:02,440
Thompson gazelle? They favor flat plains with a wide view and live in herds of several

472
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:06,440
dozen head or more. Could you photograph one of these herds for us so we can study

473
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:10,440
their behavior on the Duma step? By the way, I've attached a really good photo

474
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:14,440
and an amazing, in fact, video of a herd of them. But I'm just trying to

475
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:18,440
flex on you to see if you can even come remotely close to my incredible skill.

476
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:24,730
Thank you. Have a nice day. Okay, we need a...

477
00:56:24,730 --> 00:56:28,730
Okay, let's take it. Accept this mission? Yes. Herd of gazelles.

478
00:56:28,730 --> 00:56:35,639
Plains with a wide view. So we got that one. Can we do more than one?

479
00:56:35,639 --> 00:56:42,190
This is the project head office. Thanks for that photo you sent to the Plains zebra.

480
00:56:42,190 --> 00:56:46,190
Could we ask you to take another one with a little more detail? We want to study

481
00:56:46,190 --> 00:56:50,190
the stripes on the Plains zebra's face. So we need a face shot taken

482
00:56:50,190 --> 00:56:54,190
from head on. There's no rush, just send me one when you have time.

483
00:56:54,190 --> 00:57:01,039
Yeah, like the one we just sent you. Good day Francie.

484
00:57:01,039 --> 00:57:05,039
My name is Maliwe Essien. I'm researching savanna wildlife ecology.

485
00:57:05,039 --> 00:57:09,039
I caught wind of your studies on the Duma step and was hoping I might ask you a favor.

486
00:57:09,039 --> 00:57:13,039
I wish to teach my students how to identify a topi. But I need a

487
00:57:13,039 --> 00:57:17,039
photograph first. Topis have a distinct black pattern

488
00:57:17,039 --> 00:57:21,039
at the base of their legs. Could you take a picture from the side that shows this?

489
00:57:21,039 --> 00:57:28,719
So this is just side missions. The Maasai giraffe photo you sent us the other day

490
00:57:28,719 --> 00:57:32,719
was quite nice. You're already creating a buzz around the office. When we showed the photo

491
00:57:32,719 --> 00:57:36,719
to a bottled water manufacturer, they expressed an interest in seeing a photo

492
00:57:36,719 --> 00:57:40,719
of a giraffe drinking water. Can you manage this additional

493
00:57:40,719 --> 00:57:45,849
request? Yeah? Alright, so what do we need?

494
00:57:45,849 --> 00:57:49,849
Oh, I can only take one mission at a time. Alright, that one's better. Giraffe drinking

495
00:57:49,849 --> 00:57:53,849
water. And then if I come across a zebra,

496
00:57:53,849 --> 00:57:57,849
take a picture of its face, and we're looking for

497
00:57:57,849 --> 00:58:02,280
different discolorations

498
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:06,280
on the topi with the legs.

499
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:10,280
Alright, photo of a giraffe drinking water.

500
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:15,159
And this is also just take pictures of any new animal. It's just permanently

501
00:58:15,159 --> 00:58:21,769
there. Alright, let's go. Our next job is to photograph a Maasai giraffe drinking

502
00:58:21,769 --> 00:58:25,769
water. When giraffes drink water, they spread their front legs and drink from a standing position.

503
00:58:25,769 --> 00:58:30,269
Stay out of notice and wait for the giraffe to become thirsty.

504
00:58:30,269 --> 00:58:46,599
Alright, stalk a giraffe. I can't wait to get a dangerous shot.

505
00:58:46,599 --> 00:59:06,429
You know, it's just loading up all the photos. Yeah!

506
00:59:06,429 --> 00:59:10,920
Alright, we'll be going James.

507
00:59:21,530 --> 00:59:28,639
He just drives. Am I driving?

508
00:59:28,639 --> 00:59:32,639
If you ever want me to stop the car, press the L2 button to tell me. For your own safety,

509
00:59:32,639 --> 00:59:36,639
you can't get out of the car until it comes to a complete stop. It's none of that

510
00:59:36,639 --> 00:59:41,320
GTA bullshit. Press the R2 button and I'll start driving again.

511
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:51,949
Press circle to talk to me. Please be sure not to wander too far

512
00:59:51,949 --> 00:59:58,349
from the car. Alright, go! Alright, giraffe drinking

513
00:59:58,349 --> 01:00:07,690
water. Alright, stop. We gotta get a picture of a hippo.

514
01:00:07,690 --> 01:00:18,699
How close? Oh, he sees me. Is this like his aggression stance?

515
01:00:18,699 --> 01:00:41,469
I can get closer, I think. Hippos can't run.

516
01:00:41,469 --> 01:00:47,559
Can hippos... Wait, hold on. Can I die?

517
01:00:47,559 --> 01:00:54,599
Hold on a minute. What does that mean?

518
01:00:54,599 --> 01:01:01,719
He's like burping at me. Alright, I'm just gonna get it. We'll get all of them.

519
01:01:01,719 --> 01:01:09,150
No, no, no. Wrong button. Why is it circled?

520
01:01:09,150 --> 01:01:31,280
Wait, push it slightly, gently. Okay, let's go.

521
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:36,969
Let's get out of this way. Charge the hippo. I'm not gonna charge the hippo because

522
01:01:36,969 --> 01:01:40,969
if I die and I have to reload a save, I haven't saved it in like an hour.

523
01:01:40,969 --> 01:01:50,300
Let me save it. You're driving right towards the hippo.

524
01:01:50,300 --> 01:01:54,300
Hey, look at that. See, the hippos are bathing at the hippo pool. It's a great chance

525
01:01:55,300 --> 01:01:59,300
for some photos. Hippos can be dangerous. Be careful when taking close shots.

526
01:01:59,300 --> 01:02:05,639
No, I already got it. Let's go. We don't want any hippos coming after us.

527
01:02:05,639 --> 01:02:11,800
Let's take a detour. He just drove straight at him.

528
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:21,010
Hippos can run literally like a horse. Yeah, but

529
01:02:21,010 --> 01:02:25,010
they're like a train. It takes them like a mile to slow down.

530
01:02:25,010 --> 01:02:36,800
They're running with like five billion pounds. Why are you stopping?

531
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:42,519
Get us to a giraffe. Now. Isn't that even worse?

532
01:02:42,519 --> 01:02:51,159
Isn't the hippo actually the most dangerous animal in the world?

533
01:02:51,159 --> 01:03:00,690
Alright, stop, stop, stop, stop. Now, one of these giraffes

534
01:03:00,690 --> 01:03:09,460
has to take a drink. Bingo. Get in there. Donk your head.

535
01:03:09,460 --> 01:03:22,519
Let's... Okay, hold on. Hold on. No, no, no.

536
01:03:22,519 --> 01:03:35,139
We could get a better one. Yeah, the level of detail loading with the frame rate

537
01:03:35,139 --> 01:03:39,139
in the background. Well, yeah, it's to keep the CPU cool.

538
01:03:39,139 --> 01:03:50,530
None of these animals are dangerous. I'll be fine. Come on, come on.

539
01:03:50,530 --> 01:03:57,059
I gotta get in the magazine. No, I gotta get in the bottled water. Fuck.

540
01:03:57,059 --> 01:04:05,320
Do it again. This is a great shot. Go down one more time.

541
01:04:05,320 --> 01:04:12,159
This is good framing. I got the water, the distance.

542
01:04:12,159 --> 01:04:22,659
What the hell was that? He just lifted his leg up to pee.

543
01:04:22,659 --> 01:04:26,659
Oh, you asshole. We already... Alright, hold on. This will be good.

544
01:04:26,659 --> 01:04:41,570
If I get two of them, that's gonna look great. Go into that water.

545
01:04:41,570 --> 01:04:52,900
He's getting so close, dude. This is gonna be perfect. Look at that background, too.

546
01:04:52,900 --> 01:04:59,639
That'll go on the front of a bottle of water. I can guarantee it.

547
01:04:59,639 --> 01:05:15,760
Just in case, just in case. Hold on. I gotta get in the front of the zebra's face.

548
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:20,900
How the hell am I gonna get that? They get so scared and they just run off.

549
01:05:20,900 --> 01:05:26,289
Can I get like a different costume to make me hide or something?

550
01:05:26,289 --> 01:05:39,159
Just wait. They'll get in here. This counts as a... right in front of the face, right?

551
01:05:39,159 --> 01:05:49,460
Come on. I'm just a statue. They don't even know I'm here.

552
01:05:49,460 --> 01:06:09,679
Got it. I need a better lens. What was the last thing we did?

553
01:06:09,679 --> 01:06:17,760
Let me try it one more time. Perfect. Oh, this is gonna be good.

554
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:22,949
Leave me alone. What the fuck are you doing? What are you doing?

555
01:06:22,949 --> 01:06:26,949
I had it lined up perfectly and you just tethered me back here.

556
01:06:26,949 --> 01:06:31,960
Oh, god damn it. Whatever. I gotta get the topi, right?

557
01:06:31,960 --> 01:06:39,320
Let me take a look at those photos. Just make sure they're fucking clean.

558
01:06:39,320 --> 01:06:45,219
That's good. That one's really good. It's definitely this one.

559
01:06:45,219 --> 01:06:52,239
Too far away. No. That's a good one.

560
01:06:52,239 --> 01:07:03,000
This camera sucks. That's the good one. Somebody said rule of thirds

561
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:13,960
is a myth that makes your photos look like shit. What do you mean it's a myth?

562
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:20,679
Alright, let's go find... I really want to get the zebra

563
01:07:20,679 --> 01:07:26,260
right in the face. Let me try that one more. I gotta get that. I can't just go.

564
01:07:26,260 --> 01:07:30,260
Look, maybe if he drives the car a little bit closer he won't be like, get back here!

565
01:07:30,260 --> 01:07:39,989
You're too far away! Stop.

566
01:07:40,989 --> 01:07:58,269
He's got to get right in their path. I had it too and it just limited a loading screen.

567
01:07:58,269 --> 01:08:17,850
Fuck! I had it set up like two different times.

568
01:08:17,850 --> 01:08:23,630
And that guy just... Wait, careful! You're going too far!

569
01:08:23,630 --> 01:08:36,239
Whatever. It's close enough. I had to see two different loading screens

570
01:08:36,239 --> 01:08:42,840
when I had the shit ready to go. It's because he was worried about you.

571
01:08:42,840 --> 01:08:48,039
Don't be worried about me. I'm a fucking Francine... No, don't go back to the base camp.

572
01:08:48,039 --> 01:08:55,920
Actually, yeah. Go back to the base camp.

573
01:08:55,920 --> 01:09:01,310
I'm looking for a... Topey. Is that one right there?

574
01:09:01,310 --> 01:09:08,409
I think there's one right here. Can I go that far? Stop.

575
01:09:08,409 --> 01:09:21,000
That's definitely one right here. Does it have the same pattern that they want?

576
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:32,590
I can't tell. I think it does. Yep, it does. Get in there.

577
01:09:32,590 --> 01:09:38,430
Alright, just in case it runs away, let's get like a dogshit grandma photo.

578
01:09:38,430 --> 01:09:50,460
Just so we can at least prove that we did it. Don't you fucking dare pull me back right now.

579
01:09:50,460 --> 01:09:54,460
You fucking asshole. Stop this. I have a perfect opportunity.

580
01:09:55,460 --> 01:10:10,039
They want a side profile. Got it.

581
01:10:10,039 --> 01:10:14,470
Zoom in. I have a default camera. I can't go that far.

582
01:10:14,470 --> 01:10:22,979
Can I get closer? Oh god, that's perfect.

583
01:10:22,979 --> 01:10:40,130
Stay right there. Don't move. Alright, now get out of here!

584
01:10:40,130 --> 01:10:51,159
I should have every photo I need. Why are you being so nasty? No, I'm trying to get him away.

585
01:10:51,159 --> 01:10:55,159
There could be predators around. He's standing still from my photo.

586
01:10:55,159 --> 01:11:08,039
No, get out of here. Go. Go back to your family.

587
01:11:08,039 --> 01:11:13,300
I could have died 30 minutes ago. It isn't real life though.

588
01:11:13,300 --> 01:11:29,619
Yeah, I'll say it now. The hippo would have just snapped you in half.

589
01:11:29,619 --> 01:11:40,149
I need to get a huge lens. Yeah, once we start making money I can start buying stuff.

590
01:11:40,149 --> 01:11:52,989
Get a six foot camera lens. I don't know if I can get a comedy lens.

591
01:11:52,989 --> 01:12:02,989
How is the safari? You look satisfied with the photos you took.

592
01:12:02,989 --> 01:12:13,739
Let's examine them. Make sure we get the right ones. Send the right ones in our emails.

593
01:12:13,739 --> 01:12:18,239
That was a loud, dangerous sound. I don't know if you guys heard that.

594
01:12:18,239 --> 01:12:24,189
Let's go to the laptop. Let's see. Photos.

595
01:12:24,189 --> 01:12:31,470
Transferring photos. Let's take a look.

596
01:12:31,470 --> 01:12:35,470
Request just came in. This is for a drinking giraffe.

597
01:12:35,470 --> 01:12:40,600
I do have a photo. Which one was it?

598
01:12:40,600 --> 01:12:47,390
Let's see. We got this one, and then this one.

599
01:12:47,390 --> 01:12:51,390
That's the only two I got, right? Yeah, that's too far away.

600
01:12:51,390 --> 01:12:55,390
Too hazy and far away. I saw the animals in the shot too.

601
01:12:55,390 --> 01:13:03,710
This is terrible. It's this one. Select this one.

602
01:13:03,710 --> 01:13:12,409
That's the one. That's got to be a great angle.

603
01:13:12,409 --> 01:13:16,590
How is that not better? Distance is angle.

604
01:13:16,590 --> 01:13:21,850
That's not a good angle. I got a C for that picture.

605
01:13:21,850 --> 01:13:26,729
That's a beautiful piece of photography right there. Didn't get the full 20 grand.

606
01:13:26,729 --> 01:13:34,539
This one is done. It should have been in the center.

607
01:13:34,539 --> 01:13:38,539
I have rule of thirds. This is bullshit.

608
01:13:38,539 --> 01:13:43,359
We didn't get the herd of the gazelles yet.

609
01:13:43,359 --> 01:13:47,529
This is the side profile of that

610
01:13:47,529 --> 01:13:53,050
topi.

611
01:13:53,050 --> 01:14:01,770
Let's take a look. I don't like this photo though. It's ugly.

612
01:14:01,770 --> 01:14:15,399
This one is better. This one looks like shit.

613
01:14:15,399 --> 01:14:23,279
That's definitely a better picture. The color correction is awful.

614
01:14:23,279 --> 01:14:27,279
This one is better? I feel like the tree in the background and the dirt in the background

615
01:14:27,279 --> 01:14:31,899
is screwing up the composition there. Look at the dirt and the sand

616
01:14:31,899 --> 01:14:36,199
in the background. And his face is not defined

617
01:14:36,199 --> 01:14:41,920
with the tree in the background. This one is better.

618
01:14:41,920 --> 01:14:56,430
That's what I'm saying. Told you guys. Come on.

619
01:14:56,430 --> 01:15:00,670
They weren't asking for a face shot. They were asking for just a side profile.

620
01:15:00,670 --> 01:15:04,670
That's going against what the client asked and what the client

621
01:15:04,670 --> 01:15:15,310
was paying for. This one on the other hand, I didn't get.

622
01:15:15,310 --> 01:15:21,149
Let me see. Face shot from head on.

623
01:15:21,149 --> 01:15:30,430
That's not right.

624
01:15:30,430 --> 01:15:39,050
That's not correct. If that's what they want, then that's not what they got.

625
01:15:39,050 --> 01:15:46,430
Just for curiosity, I can't even do it. You can only do these

626
01:15:46,430 --> 01:15:50,729
missions once. Send it anyway. No, no. You only get to do them once.

627
01:15:50,729 --> 01:15:55,869
But we do have new photos. It's 3000

628
01:15:55,869 --> 01:16:03,819
per new animal, which we have hippos here.

629
01:16:03,819 --> 01:16:08,680
They both suck.

630
01:16:08,680 --> 01:16:16,539
It's the turkey. Probably this one. This one sucks.

631
01:16:16,539 --> 01:16:29,149
At least this one has a face. Bad distance. I mean, kind of

632
01:16:29,149 --> 01:16:37,279
okay distance in technique. Not really though. Hippopotamus.

633
01:16:37,279 --> 01:16:41,279
And was there any others that I didn't get that were in?

634
01:16:41,279 --> 01:16:45,819
No, we got them all. Alright, I'll delete all these.

635
01:16:45,819 --> 01:16:50,060
I'll get rid of these fucking things. I need the herd of gazelles

636
01:16:50,060 --> 01:16:54,060
and a face shot of a zebra.

637
01:16:54,060 --> 01:17:11,689
So let me go back. Let's get rid of these. Delete them.

638
01:17:11,689 --> 01:17:19,640
Transfer this one. How do I just transfer this?

639
01:17:19,640 --> 01:17:29,770
I want to keep this one. I can't keep this one forever?

640
01:17:29,770 --> 01:17:36,239
Or does it just sit in here? If I go shopping, shopping.

641
01:17:36,239 --> 01:17:42,970
I want to go shopping. Hit X. I was pressing X. It didn't do anything.

642
01:17:42,970 --> 01:17:48,039
Free shipping around the world. Wouldn't that be interesting? I don't have money.

643
01:17:48,039 --> 01:17:56,569
Save. Press X when in the transfer screen. I was.

644
01:17:56,569 --> 01:18:13,470
I was pressing X. Didn't do anything. Broke? Well, I just started.

645
01:18:13,470 --> 01:18:20,829
Have I caught all the Pokemon yet? No. Not yet.

646
01:18:20,829 --> 01:18:24,829
Don't you have camera experience from the wedding jobs you took in real life?

647
01:18:24,829 --> 01:18:29,770
Well, I have video experience, not photo experience.

648
01:18:29,770 --> 01:18:36,060
They're in the same kind of category, but they're kind of like cousins.

649
01:18:36,060 --> 01:18:40,060
Recording something that is potentially moving around and distance and

650
01:18:40,060 --> 01:18:44,060
location and lighting is a lot different instead of still picture.

651
01:18:44,060 --> 01:19:00,189
Ah, this is painful. This save. What is the save time?

652
01:19:00,189 --> 01:19:04,189
Yeah, if you're just joining us, for some reason there's a 400 megabyte save file

653
01:19:04,189 --> 01:19:08,189
and there's nothing I can do about it. It's the rarest

654
01:19:08,189 --> 01:19:12,189
joke that people get angry at because I said it like five times in the first 20 minutes

655
01:19:12,189 --> 01:19:16,939
of the stream. Alright, that's good. Let's go.

656
01:19:16,939 --> 01:19:21,369
I have to let go to sleep, right? New day?

657
01:19:21,369 --> 01:19:29,130
Can I look at the cameras? Can I do anything with the camera?

658
01:19:29,130 --> 01:19:35,279
Can I buy something for this? Type F. No, I need to buy a new

659
01:19:35,279 --> 01:19:46,029
camera. Alright, let's go to bed. F, F, F, F, F, F, F.

660
01:19:46,029 --> 01:19:53,600
This lazy shit just reads while I take photos.

661
01:19:53,600 --> 01:20:00,250
There's elephants down there? Look it. There's elephants. There's probably like

662
01:20:00,250 --> 01:20:06,479
T-Rexes and shit. Alright, we need the... Wait, I gotta take that

663
01:20:06,479 --> 01:20:10,479
mission first. We're probably gonna have a bunch of emails now.

664
01:20:10,479 --> 01:20:15,229
Alright, we got two opportunities.

665
01:20:15,229 --> 01:20:21,439
This one's boring. The ultimate big mouth.

666
01:20:40,439 --> 01:20:52,130
Okay, I'll do it. That one's more interesting.

667
01:20:52,130 --> 01:20:56,560
We need the close-up of the face and a hippo

668
01:20:56,560 --> 01:21:01,189
yawning. You got it.

669
01:21:01,189 --> 01:21:05,189
Hey, let the professional decide what they're going to do.

670
01:21:05,189 --> 01:21:09,810
Mr. Reading Harry Potter start to finish.

671
01:21:09,810 --> 01:21:14,880
I don't have my... I have a thing that I put on the ground to wheel.

672
01:21:14,880 --> 01:21:32,550
And I took it out because I VR-ified my room.

673
01:21:32,550 --> 01:21:37,039
It's like I'm glued to the ground right now.

674
01:21:37,039 --> 01:21:41,039
Okay. Hello, Francine. We're looking for

675
01:21:41,039 --> 01:21:55,569
hippos this time, right? Oh, jumbo.

676
01:21:55,569 --> 01:22:00,199
If it's not far, but let me take you to the hippo pool. Go ahead and hop in the back.

677
01:22:00,199 --> 01:22:06,289
Snap a yawning hippopotamus. I'm gonna try.

678
01:22:06,289 --> 01:22:21,079
How do hippos... I'm not gonna read that, but I don't know. I have no idea.

679
01:22:21,079 --> 01:22:26,720
I don't know. Okay, let's go.

680
01:22:26,720 --> 01:22:38,689
Go hide in a bush. When the screen flashes red, I'm getting too close.

681
01:22:38,689 --> 01:22:45,090
Here comes a big yawn.

682
01:22:45,090 --> 01:22:53,989
Am I hidden right now? This one seems pretty alerted.

683
01:22:53,989 --> 01:23:09,810
This one seems pretty alerted. I got it.

684
01:23:09,810 --> 01:23:14,050
I got a pretty good video of that hippo coming to kill me.

685
01:23:14,050 --> 01:23:18,050
You wake up in the fucking hippo. Oh, you all right? No photos

686
01:23:18,050 --> 01:23:37,250
worth risking life and limb over. You're finally awake.

687
01:23:37,250 --> 01:23:41,250
Hey, I didn't get your yawning hippo, but I got a great YouTube

688
01:23:41,250 --> 01:23:45,430
like Facebook video of that. That's gonna be shared.

689
01:23:45,430 --> 01:24:02,069
50 million times. Let's try again.

690
01:24:02,069 --> 01:24:10,789
Hide in a bush. I gotta be very, very careful. Very patient.

691
01:24:10,789 --> 01:24:18,359
For a second at the top, I thought that said, stop a yawning

692
01:24:18,359 --> 01:24:23,680
hippopotamus. Stop them from yawning. What am I supposed to do?

693
01:24:23,680 --> 01:24:37,699
This time, I'm gonna be very cautious.

694
01:24:37,699 --> 01:24:44,930
They're all turning the other way. Yawning hippo.

695
01:24:44,930 --> 01:24:54,869
That one right in the middle. Or on the left. One on the left?

696
01:24:54,869 --> 01:25:04,210
That's not a bad shot. Not a bad shot if you just open your mouth.

697
01:25:04,210 --> 01:25:08,770
I gotta wait for it. If he lifts his head up over the bush, that would look so good.

698
01:25:08,770 --> 01:25:37,000
Who's gonna do it? Which one of you, like, thumbs

699
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:52,550
is gonna open your mouth? I can't get closer than this. Do it.

700
01:25:52,550 --> 01:26:00,689
Zoom in. I have the default camera. I can't go in any further.

701
01:26:00,689 --> 01:26:13,439
And if I get closer, they'll attack me. Look, I'm gonna come out of the camera mode and

702
01:26:13,439 --> 01:26:25,350
I'm gonna do it. Oh yeah, you yawn first. That's right.

703
01:26:25,350 --> 01:26:48,500
No? Did it work? Yawn. Somebody yawn.

704
01:26:48,500 --> 01:27:03,300
I can't get closer. The last time I got closer, they tried

705
01:27:03,300 --> 01:27:17,000
to kill me. No, this one just went to bed. Come on, somebody do it.

706
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:38,369
They're both asleep. Wait. You just woke... Okay, that's actually not a bad thing.

707
01:27:38,369 --> 01:27:42,680
You just woke this one up. Maybe it'll do a, I just woke up yawn.

708
01:27:42,680 --> 01:27:55,520
No, don't turn the other direction. They're behind you. Where are you going?

709
01:27:55,520 --> 01:28:15,029
Turn this way. Alright, it has to be you. No, no, no, no.

710
01:28:15,029 --> 01:28:25,409
Don't obstruct it from the... Shot ruined.

711
01:28:25,409 --> 01:28:51,439
I'm gonna have to get this one over here. Yawn. Oh, this is not a bad shot.

712
01:28:51,439 --> 01:28:57,539
Come on, do it. You just woke up. This is your opportunity to yawn. Do it.

713
01:28:57,539 --> 01:29:18,850
How much is this one? You're the only one left in the pool. Please just yawn.

714
01:29:18,850 --> 01:29:25,439
When is your AI gonna understand that it's time to yawn?

715
01:29:25,439 --> 01:29:35,800
Is that about the yawns?

716
01:29:35,800 --> 01:29:39,800
No, it's a huge thing. They go like, they look like a snake

717
01:29:39,800 --> 01:29:43,800
when they do it. The jaws unhinge. And they like a swallow and

718
01:29:43,800 --> 01:29:50,850
an egg. I don't think that was a yawn. I could probably pass it off as one though.

719
01:29:50,850 --> 01:29:58,159
The mouth is open. Whoops, that's a... I don't want to do vertical.

720
01:29:58,159 --> 01:30:17,090
Great. Wait, wait, wait. He's turning around. This is good.

721
01:30:17,090 --> 01:30:21,090
This is really good, really good, really good. Do it. No, no, no, no. This way.

722
01:30:21,090 --> 01:30:29,939
No, no, no, no, no. Wait, wait, wait. Wait for him to land. Wait for him to land.

723
01:30:29,939 --> 01:30:57,829
Okay. That was a yawn coming up. Nope. Get out of here.

724
01:30:57,829 --> 01:31:02,199
I think Gazelle just ruined everything. Oh, you know what? That's... I'm gonna take...

725
01:31:02,199 --> 01:31:09,810
Right? Why not just take that? That's a good turning

726
01:31:09,810 --> 01:31:21,909
profile picture. Where's the other hippo? Just still

727
01:31:21,909 --> 01:31:38,100
sitting there. Isn't there a third hippo? This really is what...

728
01:31:38,100 --> 01:31:42,100
You guys think this is... Wow, this is boring. I've seen

729
01:31:42,100 --> 01:31:46,100
like Planet Earth. I've seen the National Geographic stuff. It's so much more interesting than this.

730
01:31:46,100 --> 01:31:51,359
No, it isn't. To get the photo of the

731
01:31:51,359 --> 01:31:55,729
hippopotamus yawning and have it really look cool and on like the National Geographic

732
01:31:55,729 --> 01:31:59,729
PBS stuff. Somebody comes out here and does this for like six straight days.

733
01:31:59,729 --> 01:32:12,359
Just hang out here and they just eat like sandwiches.

734
01:32:12,359 --> 01:32:16,359
You want to know why that's so difficult to do? Because think about that.

735
01:32:16,359 --> 01:32:20,359
There is one moment that you have to be ready to take the photo.

736
01:32:20,359 --> 01:32:24,359
And it might take up to five straight days before you get it. At any point

737
01:32:24,359 --> 01:32:28,359
in those five days. You gotta be like, oh shit! And like grab

738
01:32:28,359 --> 01:32:32,720
like snap! Because you might be sitting there for like 16 hours.

739
01:32:32,720 --> 01:32:43,350
That's hard. Will you open your mouth and yawn please? There's the other one.

740
01:32:43,350 --> 01:32:47,649
Do a double yawn. Do like a Dragon Ball Z fusion yawn together.

741
01:32:47,649 --> 01:33:05,060
Come on. This is a bad photo. I have to move. This is a

742
01:33:05,060 --> 01:33:09,060
hippopotamus right? I just want to be like, yes, yes it is. Because they're not

743
01:33:09,060 --> 01:33:19,380
yawning. These are elephants. These are baby

744
01:33:19,380 --> 01:33:23,680
elephants. They could be. But what if they... Good. Now yawn

745
01:33:23,680 --> 01:33:27,680
together. One, two, three, yawn.

746
01:33:27,680 --> 01:33:33,840
Can they see me? Is that why they're not doing this? Is that why they're not comfortable

747
01:33:33,840 --> 01:33:41,600
enough to yawn because I'm sitting here? They said, the guy told me to hide in a

748
01:33:41,600 --> 01:33:47,890
bush. He said hide in a bush.

749
01:33:47,890 --> 01:33:59,279
Only these bushes are here. Bingo. You aren't in a bush.

750
01:33:59,279 --> 01:34:04,159
I can't take a photo inside the bush. Alright.

751
01:34:04,159 --> 01:34:08,529
I'm in the bush. Cool. Let's take a photo. That is just good.

752
01:34:08,529 --> 01:34:30,369
Do it. This is good. This depth of field here. Come on. Open your

753
01:34:30,369 --> 01:34:52,899
mouth. Please. Do it. That's not depth of field.

754
01:34:52,899 --> 01:34:59,510
It's low resolution. Well, whatever. How are you not...

755
01:34:59,510 --> 01:35:08,199
Here it comes. I gotta be ready. What was that? What?

756
01:35:08,199 --> 01:35:12,199
Was that a fast yawn? That was like a super fast forward, fast forward

757
01:35:12,199 --> 01:35:36,659
motion yawn. I'm so angry.

758
01:35:36,659 --> 01:35:44,399
Just like in real life. I almost wasn't ready. Do it.

759
01:35:44,399 --> 01:35:49,649
Come on. He's getting right into frame. Right now. Stop.

760
01:35:49,649 --> 01:35:53,649
Open the mouth. Let's go. Come on. Don't get blocked by the low res

761
01:35:53,649 --> 01:35:57,649
grass, bush thing. Don't do it. Do it. Here we go.

762
01:35:57,649 --> 01:36:10,819
One. Two. Do it.

763
01:36:10,819 --> 01:36:24,390
Is that gonna be flurry? Why?

764
01:36:24,390 --> 01:36:30,850
Wait. Yes. Perfect. See ya later.

765
01:36:30,850 --> 01:36:39,680
Check him first. Hold on. Check him. Check him. Check him. Good.

766
01:36:39,680 --> 01:36:48,239
That's the best one. Look at that one.

767
01:36:48,239 --> 01:37:00,149
The rest of these are just not. I don't even know what these are.

768
01:37:00,149 --> 01:37:04,149
I was taking a photo trying to time the mouth opening and I didn't get it once.

769
01:37:04,149 --> 01:37:13,680
I almost got it right there. I like these two.

770
01:37:13,680 --> 01:37:20,930
They just look like two terriers looking at me. I like this one.

771
01:37:20,930 --> 01:37:28,500
I do. Well, we got the thing we needed.

772
01:37:28,500 --> 01:37:35,539
What's the other mission we can do? Let's see. Yeah, get a shot of those

773
01:37:35,539 --> 01:37:40,289
zebra and herd of gazelles. I need a zebra.

774
01:37:40,289 --> 01:37:44,979
I need to get that zebra shot. Let's go. No, don't go back to the camp.

775
01:37:44,979 --> 01:37:52,340
You can't take me a little bit further out. Why? Why can you not take me

776
01:37:52,340 --> 01:38:00,149
further out? Zebra right here. No, I can't go that far away.

777
01:38:00,149 --> 01:38:10,119
Let's just turn this one in. Was it inevitable?

778
01:38:10,119 --> 01:38:18,760
Was it inevitable? I think it was inevitable. Uh oh.

779
01:38:18,760 --> 01:38:36,039
We're going back down to zero, boys and girls.

780
01:38:36,039 --> 01:39:06,289
I got the photo. We good? Wait, we're back. German is disappearing.

781
01:39:06,289 --> 01:39:19,220
Quick, get in. It was a long drive, but we made it.

782
01:39:19,220 --> 01:39:25,699
Yeah, we have some other issues going on here.

783
01:39:25,699 --> 01:39:31,350
Something got fucked up. Something definitely got really fucked up.

784
01:39:31,350 --> 01:39:35,350
We're seeing some odd shit at this residence, I'll tell ya.

785
01:39:35,350 --> 01:39:42,319
Alright, so far it was good. That was me.

786
01:39:42,319 --> 01:39:52,050
Alright, let's get these out of here.

787
01:39:52,050 --> 01:39:57,680
Is this whole game just to sell people Sony cameras?

788
01:39:57,680 --> 01:40:02,310
Sony? At least Sony cameras? They don't look like Sony.

789
01:40:02,310 --> 01:40:06,609
Is that a Sony video camera? You know what I mean by that.

790
01:40:06,609 --> 01:40:14,609
Well, none of you guys are going to buy this shit. This is like 12 years ago.

791
01:40:14,609 --> 01:40:24,609
Alright, this is the one we're going to use. Wait, wait, wait.

792
01:40:24,609 --> 01:40:28,609
It's doing a poor job. Alright, $20,000. We got the yawn.

793
01:40:28,609 --> 01:40:37,430
Let's take a look. Uh, I don't know. This is tough.

794
01:40:37,430 --> 01:40:41,430
Because, here's the problem. This one is definitely way more pronounced.

795
01:40:41,430 --> 01:40:45,430
But this one is centered.

796
01:40:45,430 --> 01:40:57,539
The mouth is actually, you can see down, like the urinal.

797
01:40:57,539 --> 01:41:03,250
The tilted one is a big, what about over here? Nah, not these ones.

798
01:41:03,250 --> 01:41:11,590
This one has more emotion behind it. That's really tired.

799
01:41:11,590 --> 01:41:20,819
But yeah, somebody said the game is probably coded for the

800
01:41:20,819 --> 01:41:33,510
looking down the PVC pipe. I like this photo better,

801
01:41:33,510 --> 01:41:44,069
but this one's probably worth more points. I'm going with that one.

802
01:41:44,069 --> 01:41:51,319
I'm going with my gut here. Target, distance, excellent technique.

803
01:41:51,319 --> 01:41:56,710
Alright, now that's alright. I got exactly what I came in for.

804
01:41:56,710 --> 01:42:04,899
$20,000. Oh yeah, by the way, sorry for telling you.

805
01:42:04,899 --> 01:42:09,399
The pre-stream was a little odd. Because I'm just sitting there

806
01:42:09,399 --> 01:42:13,399
going, yeah, we're wearing the bright red. There's no stream today.

807
01:42:13,399 --> 01:42:17,399
Stream's not happening today, is what I said in the chat. And then I got green.

808
01:42:17,399 --> 01:42:21,399
And then the problem was fixed. And then me and Italics were talking about

809
01:42:21,399 --> 01:42:25,399
how we can kill bandwidth to each other now somehow, which wasn't

810
01:42:25,399 --> 01:42:29,399
really necessarily a problem before.

811
01:42:29,399 --> 01:42:33,399
And we had like fucking 60 plus mile per hour winds in Vegas.

812
01:42:33,399 --> 01:42:37,399
It was raining. I don't know, there's a lot of weird shit going on. So there's probably like more than two or three

813
01:42:37,399 --> 01:42:41,399
problems, but I was told they were going to get fixed today. So we'll see.

814
01:42:41,399 --> 01:42:47,279
Alright, so let me...

815
01:42:47,279 --> 01:42:51,460
I got $63,000. Should I get more photo storage or just save it?

816
01:42:51,460 --> 01:42:56,279
I think I have to buy this to unlock the next couple of things to buy.

817
01:42:56,279 --> 01:43:05,890
Alright, we'll save it. So let's go to sleep.

818
01:43:05,890 --> 01:43:14,079
See what we get in the morning. See what new missions we get.

819
01:43:14,079 --> 01:43:19,670
Yeah, apparently Valentine's Day broke a rain record. Like across

820
01:43:19,670 --> 01:43:25,000
all of Vegas. It was raining everywhere. Alright, what do you got for me today?

821
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:34,789
Nothing, still on the same page in the book. Alright, head

822
01:43:34,789 --> 01:43:40,180
we gotta get this. Yeah, we have to just get the herd.

823
01:43:40,180 --> 01:43:48,319
The herd of gazelles and the zebra head.

824
01:43:48,319 --> 01:43:55,060
Let's go take a look at the map. We need to take a photo of the herd of gazelles.

825
01:43:55,060 --> 01:43:59,060
Look for a chance to capture as many gazelles as possible in one shot.

826
01:43:59,060 --> 01:44:11,279
So let's just go. Let's not pick like a place.

827
01:44:11,279 --> 01:44:15,279
I don't know why, but for one second I thought this just quit to my desktop and this was my desktop

828
01:44:15,279 --> 01:44:20,550
background. I don't know why I thought that. I was like what the fuck, why are we on my desktop?

829
01:44:20,550 --> 01:44:33,479
I don't know why. This is the standard Windows XP

830
01:44:33,479 --> 01:44:40,390
background. Yeah, this is the

831
01:44:40,390 --> 01:44:45,460
Dell computer background that has never changed in ten years.

832
01:44:45,460 --> 01:45:12,069
Alright, let's take a picture of some gazelles. What is that? I don't know,

833
01:45:12,069 --> 01:45:24,819
it looks like a cat. It's gonna be so blurry. Can I look at them?

834
01:45:24,819 --> 01:45:34,119
Now this is, I was testing the white balance. That's what this photo is.

835
01:45:34,119 --> 01:45:38,119
I'm not taking pictures of anything, I'm just testing the camera to make sure I have enough battery to take a picture.

836
01:45:38,119 --> 01:46:06,840
It's a pretty nice big footprint. No, I need a better

837
01:46:06,840 --> 01:46:14,960
camera. Can't take photos out of the window of a car.

838
01:46:14,960 --> 01:46:23,750
Alright, where are these gazelles? I don't see a herd of gazelles anywhere.

839
01:46:23,750 --> 01:46:28,689
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

840
01:46:28,689 --> 01:46:39,239
Okay, let's get set up. Should they be running? It wants a

841
01:46:39,239 --> 01:46:47,000
stampede of gazelles, right? I gotta get as many as possible.

842
01:46:47,000 --> 01:47:12,640
I gotta get back it up a little. That distance is bad. I got, I already

843
01:47:12,640 --> 01:47:26,800
got it, I got it. I already got it. That's a good photo, but it's not a whole

844
01:47:26,800 --> 01:47:41,590
herd. Alright, now make them run. I got it already, right? Alright, get it.

845
01:47:41,590 --> 01:47:50,930
Why does this look like shit? There's something wrong about this photo. Why does this look

846
01:47:50,930 --> 01:47:58,560
so off? No, get back in the car and drive me to where I need to go.

847
01:47:58,560 --> 01:48:08,180
There's too much ground in that photo. That's exactly what it is. Alright, take me to the tree.

848
01:48:08,180 --> 01:48:21,880
Okay, now I can walk a little further.

849
01:48:21,880 --> 01:48:26,949
What constitutes a herd? Is a herd three or more?

850
01:48:26,949 --> 01:48:41,199
At the umbrella tree. Three or more is a herd.

851
01:48:41,199 --> 01:48:49,279
At least fifteen. Alright, this couple right here.

852
01:48:49,279 --> 01:48:59,140
Let's get a little closer. Not bad, not bad. Turn, turn, turn, turn.

853
01:48:59,140 --> 01:49:10,100
Tilt. One on the top left. Turn a little. How many grains

854
01:49:10,100 --> 01:49:16,069
of sand is a beach? No, that's true. It's because of the sand that doesn't mean

855
01:49:16,069 --> 01:49:25,939
it's a beach. No, it has to, I gotta go this way.

856
01:49:25,939 --> 01:49:34,979
That's bordering on a goddamn ocean. Let me go over here.

857
01:49:34,979 --> 01:49:39,279
I think I fucked up my opportunity to take a good picture. So they're getting the terrible one.

858
01:49:39,279 --> 01:49:43,279
It's just for like a classroom, right? It's for students.

859
01:49:43,279 --> 01:49:53,779
They don't need a National Geographic quality photo. They just need

860
01:49:53,779 --> 01:50:04,659
a photo. Yeah, I scared them all off. There's one more down there.

861
01:50:04,659 --> 01:50:23,539
Yeah, I blew it. Let's go. I'm gonna have to use that terrible one.

862
01:50:23,539 --> 01:50:39,140
She probably stinks. What?

863
01:50:39,140 --> 01:50:54,949
Watch out, watch out, watch out. Don't run them over. There's definitely no animal

864
01:50:54,949 --> 01:51:02,199
run over physics. I would guarantee that's not the case. I got a photo

865
01:51:02,199 --> 01:51:11,619
100 degrees and you can't shower.

866
01:51:11,619 --> 01:51:18,159
You can like roll around in one of these little lakes.

867
01:51:18,159 --> 01:51:22,399
One of these little ponds. You can just like roll around in it with some like Dove.

868
01:51:22,399 --> 01:51:27,479
Just buy like his 25 pack of the Dove dog shit

869
01:51:27,479 --> 01:51:36,319
brand. Get like a Lever 2000 or something.

870
01:51:36,319 --> 01:51:42,529
It's probably like full. Don't, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop the car, stop the car,

871
01:51:42,529 --> 01:51:46,529
stop the car, stop the car, stop the car, stop the car, stop the car,

872
01:51:46,529 --> 01:52:55,409
stop the car. Come on, look over here. This is good.

873
01:52:55,409 --> 01:52:59,720
This is good. There's a little too much tree. Bingo. There's the shot right there.

874
01:52:59,720 --> 01:53:23,670
Maybe, hold on, one more, one more. It's not even in focus.

875
01:53:23,670 --> 01:53:31,779
We'll get one like dead on too. Over here. Watch this shit.

876
01:53:31,779 --> 01:53:37,409
This is gonna be fucking beautiful. It's gonna get a little bit of leaf,

877
01:53:37,409 --> 01:53:47,920
a little bit of leaves in the foreground. I need a better lens.

878
01:53:47,920 --> 01:53:57,989
Oh, fuck, there's another one. Look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look. This is perfect.

879
01:53:57,989 --> 01:54:01,989
It's like a cat sitting on a tree. Come on, get the leaves. We need foreground,

880
01:54:01,989 --> 01:54:06,609
mid-ground, background. No, no, this is not a good enough lens.

881
01:54:06,609 --> 01:54:22,100
I can't do what I want to do. Whatever. None of those will work.

882
01:54:22,100 --> 01:54:29,199
Do I actually have to have the car take me there? Smelly lady.

883
01:54:29,199 --> 01:54:33,199
You don't know that. Oh, there is a Sony lanyard on her neck.

884
01:54:33,199 --> 01:54:37,199
Now I understand why you guys saying Sony sponsor.

885
01:54:37,199 --> 01:54:53,520
How was the safari? It was good. Okay, transfer those.

886
01:54:53,520 --> 01:55:00,630
I don't care if one of the photos is terrible. Let's get an email going.

887
01:55:00,630 --> 01:55:05,760
Head, a herd of gazelles. I don't know if we have that many.

888
01:55:05,760 --> 01:55:13,569
It's only for 10,000. Who cares? Let's take a look.

889
01:55:13,569 --> 01:55:18,760
I like that one. That one's pretty great. This is the best one.

890
01:55:18,760 --> 01:55:24,199
No, sucks. Delete. I like it. It's quaint.

891
01:55:24,199 --> 01:55:29,199
No, this one's good. Not good. Actually,

892
01:55:29,199 --> 01:55:33,439
kind of good. This is not a bad photo. If only

893
01:55:33,439 --> 01:55:37,439
that one in the, all the way far to the top right. If it was just two.

894
01:55:37,439 --> 01:55:47,569
There it is. There it is. Okay. This photo's really bad, but it's the only one that's a

895
01:55:47,569 --> 01:55:59,409
real herd. It has to be this one. Whatever.

896
01:55:59,409 --> 01:56:06,850
I'll take the D-minus that I'm going to get for this photo.

897
01:56:06,850 --> 01:56:15,189
I'm sorry. I'll take a C. Now we, ultimate big mouth. Didn't I already do this?

898
01:56:15,189 --> 01:56:20,050
Oh yeah, these are done. Okay. Let's get the

899
01:56:20,050 --> 01:56:29,720
picture of the, whatever it is in the tree.

900
01:56:29,720 --> 01:56:34,789
Clearly this is, ah, this is clearly the best photo. Or this one. So let's just

901
01:56:34,789 --> 01:56:43,380
give him a shitty one, because I want to hold on to a couple of these. Okay, this is like a very clear

902
01:56:43,380 --> 01:56:50,630
I'm staring right in the camera picture, send it over. Marvelous. Marvelous.

903
01:56:50,630 --> 01:56:57,750
Marvelous. Perfect score. Uh, that's a

904
01:56:57,750 --> 01:57:03,520
vervet monkey adult. Uh, I need to delete some of these. Let's save

905
01:57:03,520 --> 01:57:09,680
a couple of them. Not this one. Get rid of that. I like this one. Get rid of

906
01:57:09,680 --> 01:57:13,680
this one. Get rid of this one. Keep that one. I like it. I don't,

907
01:57:13,680 --> 01:57:17,680
all these can go. We already got the yawn done, so I'm going to keep the one that

908
01:57:17,680 --> 01:57:26,390
I like. I like that one. Bad, bad, bad, bad.

909
01:57:26,390 --> 01:57:34,020
No, keep turkey. Delete. So again, let's try

910
01:57:34,020 --> 01:57:39,010
this again. X. X. X.

911
01:57:39,010 --> 01:57:43,319
Check. Check all. X. I can't, like,

912
01:57:43,319 --> 01:57:51,079
bring them over anywhere. They might just have to sit here. Unless, like,

913
01:57:51,079 --> 01:57:57,029
there's something I'm missing. I need to buy the storage.

914
01:57:57,029 --> 01:58:10,479
Really. First number you can hold to 50. Carry with your camera

915
01:58:10,479 --> 01:58:14,479
without feeling, no, this is the camera. Yeah, that's the camera photo

916
01:58:14,479 --> 01:58:18,850
still. Alright, let's go to bed.

917
01:58:18,850 --> 01:58:25,140
Wake up in the morning. See what's on the list. I can't wait to do a tiger.

918
01:58:25,140 --> 01:58:37,489
Don't forget to check your email. I do every day, man.

919
01:58:37,489 --> 01:58:41,489
Important. Camera repairs complete. The camera you sent in

920
01:58:41,489 --> 01:58:46,500
for repairs before your departure just came back. New camera.

921
01:58:46,500 --> 01:58:50,930
It's a digital SLR camera. The A100 lens kit.

922
01:58:50,930 --> 01:58:54,930
We've made arrangements so you can use it right away to take great photos for us, of course.

923
01:58:54,930 --> 01:59:03,760
Okay, this is a tree monkey.

924
01:59:03,760 --> 01:59:07,760
Tree monkey with a black face, okay. Hello, Francine. My name is David Moore.

925
01:59:07,760 --> 01:59:11,760
I work with the African Photo Press. We're currently looking for a shot of a

926
01:59:11,760 --> 01:59:15,760
vervet monkey climbing a tree. I already got one. I already do- it's done.

927
01:59:15,760 --> 01:59:20,710
To fill out our wildlife photo collection. If you've taken any, could you send them my way?

928
01:59:20,710 --> 01:59:24,710
If it's any help, vervet monkeys are often spotted where humans live. Good luck.

929
01:59:24,710 --> 01:59:29,970
Already got it. Done. Good thing I held onto it. That's good.

930
01:59:29,970 --> 01:59:41,170
That's a good photo, too. Done. Take it.

931
01:59:41,170 --> 01:59:50,020
Thanks for the money. Cool. So now what?

932
01:59:50,020 --> 01:59:56,880
Go back to bed. Let me go look at my camera, though.

933
01:59:56,880 --> 02:00:01,439
A100. DT 18-70. F-stop is 3.55.

934
02:00:01,439 --> 02:00:05,880
Cool. The camera we sent to the head office for repairs has come back.

935
02:00:05,880 --> 02:00:09,880
Put it inside the camera case. You can check it any time. Proper focusing is key to using this camera.

936
02:00:09,880 --> 02:00:13,880
Now the camera is set to autofocus. If you're not sure of a function,

937
02:00:13,880 --> 02:00:21,829
consult the camera photography manual on the bookshelf.

938
02:00:21,829 --> 02:00:25,829
So this is an autofocus camera. It's a body. Basic features intended

939
02:00:25,829 --> 02:00:29,829
for amateurs. Get rid of that. An easy to use camera utilizing super

940
02:00:29,829 --> 02:00:37,010
steady shot image stabilization and advanced autofocus.

941
02:00:37,010 --> 02:00:42,600
Lens. Standard zoom lens mimics the human eye's field of vision for a true

942
02:00:42,600 --> 02:00:46,600
perspective, not intended for long distance shots. There it is.

943
02:00:46,600 --> 02:00:57,800
So it's just on there. All right. Are they getting new tools or anything?

944
02:00:57,800 --> 02:01:06,770
Let's go look at the bookshelf. I want a Sony camera.

945
02:01:06,770 --> 02:01:11,399
All right. We've got to look at some of this. A100. Full featured

946
02:01:11,399 --> 02:01:15,399
camera, but you can always use auto mode if you want to keep things simple.

947
02:01:15,399 --> 02:01:19,399
I never use auto on a camera. I always go to manual focus.

948
02:01:19,399 --> 02:01:23,399
The A100 has four noteworthy features. The lenses are interchangeable.

949
02:01:23,399 --> 02:01:27,399
You can introduce selective blur. You can greatly customize how you shoot.

950
02:01:27,399 --> 02:01:31,399
Plus, it helps stabilize camera shake. I'll introduce each one of these

951
02:01:31,399 --> 02:01:37,029
in a separate column. Focus. We've all seen autofocus photos

952
02:01:37,029 --> 02:01:41,029
for the subject. You meant to take a picture of lines of blurred. You need to focus on your subject.

953
02:01:41,029 --> 02:01:45,029
With the A100, you can focus by half pressing the circle button or the R1 button.

954
02:01:45,029 --> 02:01:49,029
That's not going to be terrible. Pressure sensitive PlayStation 3

955
02:01:49,029 --> 02:01:53,029
bullshit. Great. If you move the left stick around while doing so, you can even change the

956
02:01:53,029 --> 02:02:00,390
angle. A half press to focus.

957
02:02:00,390 --> 02:02:08,369
And you can move the stick around. Depth field.

958
02:02:08,369 --> 02:02:12,369
Depth field contributes to how much of your scene, what range around the focus distance

959
02:02:12,369 --> 02:02:16,680
remains sharp. It's also tied to a lens's zoom. Zooming in limits the depth of

960
02:02:16,680 --> 02:02:21,430
field while zooming out increases it. Yes. I know that.

961
02:02:21,430 --> 02:02:25,430
Now we've got a camera menu. Oh boy, we have an actual camera menu.

962
02:02:25,430 --> 02:02:29,430
Open the camera menu button by pressing triangle. From the camera

963
02:02:29,430 --> 02:02:33,430
menu, you can change various camera preferences in addition to trickier photography settings.

964
02:02:33,430 --> 02:02:37,430
You can also set preferences for continuous shooting, image confirmation after you snap

965
02:02:37,430 --> 02:02:41,430
a photo, shooting in black and white, and so on. So that's triangle.

966
02:02:41,430 --> 02:02:47,510
Different exposures.

967
02:02:47,510 --> 02:02:51,510
Four modes. Auto, aperture priority, shutter speed priority, and manual exposure.

968
02:02:51,510 --> 02:02:56,199
And auto, snapping pictures is fully automatic. Or half

969
02:02:56,199 --> 02:03:00,199
auto for the other two. Half manual modes. In manual, you set everything up yourself.

970
02:03:00,199 --> 02:03:06,479
Advanced users though. That's what I will be using. Yep.

971
02:03:06,479 --> 02:03:10,920
Aperture priority. Uh huh.

972
02:03:10,920 --> 02:03:15,350
Narrow depth of field for a low value. So you get to like really get

973
02:03:15,350 --> 02:03:23,670
really, really detailed motion blur moments.

974
02:03:23,670 --> 02:03:29,439
So we want low aperture value. Shutter speed. This is a good, this is very educational.

975
02:03:29,439 --> 02:03:39,880
All this is good stuff. Shutter speed is how much

976
02:03:39,880 --> 02:03:43,880
the lens remains open. 1, 30th of a second, I'm on 1,000th

977
02:03:43,880 --> 02:03:47,880
of a second for example. Slow shutter speed, you get more motion blur

978
02:03:47,880 --> 02:03:51,880
while faster shutter speeds will freeze your subjects in its tracks.

979
02:03:51,880 --> 02:03:55,880
A little motion blur can punch up your action shots though.

980
02:03:55,880 --> 02:04:01,510
Am I going to be taking pictures of that? Okay. We're going to need a high

981
02:04:01,510 --> 02:04:07,920
shutter. Yeah, this is exposure, right?

982
02:04:07,920 --> 02:04:13,300
How do I do it? Use plus to take brighter photos

983
02:04:13,300 --> 02:04:17,300
minus mimics to take darker. Okay, well how do I just, I guess, correct it?

984
02:04:17,300 --> 02:04:22,630
Ice. Ice start AF.

985
02:04:22,630 --> 02:04:26,630
Original features focuses for you automatically even if you don't half press the shutter.

986
02:04:26,630 --> 02:04:30,630
Naturally this is very useful since the camera will continue to focus for you as long as you have the viewfinder open.

987
02:04:30,630 --> 02:04:35,510
I'm going to just go through it. I know how to do this shit. Creative style. You can change it to

988
02:04:35,510 --> 02:04:39,880
like sepia, black and white. Yep. With the

989
02:04:39,880 --> 02:04:43,880
continue, you can hold down the circle button to continuously snap photos.

990
02:04:43,880 --> 02:04:47,880
You can set this up in the feature settings.

991
02:04:47,880 --> 02:04:53,270
You're limited to three shots in a row. You need to release

992
02:04:53,270 --> 02:05:03,000
the button before you can shoot again. I'm ready. Let's take a look.

993
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:07,300
I gotta go back to bed, right? Yeah, back to sleep. I already handed in the

994
02:05:07,300 --> 02:05:19,329
perfect monkey one. New emails? No. What's the thing I

995
02:05:19,329 --> 02:05:23,960
haven't done? I have to get a photo of this zebra.

996
02:05:23,960 --> 02:05:29,520
Close up in the face. Alright, let's go.

997
02:05:29,520 --> 02:05:45,970
Is this fun? Yeah. This is a good game.

998
02:05:45,970 --> 02:05:56,149
Having fun. It's fun to take pictures of animals. Now we have a camera that

999
02:05:56,149 --> 02:06:08,390
I can actually toggle different settings. And we're only in the first area.

1000
02:06:08,390 --> 02:06:16,149
This is the home of the area up there with lions and tigers and shit.

1001
02:06:16,149 --> 02:06:20,760
Let's take a look at the camera. Here we go. Here's our new camera.

1002
02:06:20,760 --> 02:06:28,560
Let's go into the settings here. Exposure mode. Aperture priority.

1003
02:06:28,560 --> 02:06:33,699
Let's do manual. Shutter speed. Let's get like a high shutter.

1004
02:06:33,699 --> 02:06:41,000
No, actually not yet. This is like the aperture stop.

1005
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:48,420
I really wish I could see the auto-review

1006
02:06:48,420 --> 02:06:52,420
on creative style. I wish I could see what it looks like without

1007
02:06:52,420 --> 02:07:08,180
getting too... Shutter speed's too long. Well, I'm trying to... You'll see.

1008
02:07:08,180 --> 02:07:57,060
I need a zebra. Alright. Can you stop? Let's go.

1009
02:07:57,060 --> 02:08:09,989
Wait, what? There's a cheetah? Don't get... Let me out of the car. Let me out!

1010
02:08:09,989 --> 02:08:36,149
Oh god, he's gonna be... I gotta get him like stalking. I'm getting some

1011
02:08:36,149 --> 02:08:52,149
pretty good shots already here. I shouldn't even need to bring the camera out. He's gonna be

1012
02:08:52,149 --> 02:09:01,060
running fast. Heard of gazelles. It's this time the prey got away.

1013
02:09:01,060 --> 02:09:05,060
We know that the cheetahs live on the... Yeah, well what the hell? Why wouldn't you let me get out of the car?

1014
02:09:05,060 --> 02:09:13,039
Are you ready to go? What? Hold on.

1015
02:09:13,039 --> 02:09:20,529
Why wouldn't you let me get out of the car before? Alright, is there a zebra around here?

1016
02:09:20,529 --> 02:09:28,149
Alright, there's no... I do not see a zebra. Look, a cheetah! Stay in the fucking

1017
02:09:28,149 --> 02:09:42,920
car! Yeah, let's go. Why do you keep

1018
02:09:42,920 --> 02:10:06,100
stopping me? Is that a zebra? Over there? There it is.

1019
02:10:06,100 --> 02:10:16,420
I'm gonna be too far away from him though. You do know we're on the mission to take a picture

1020
02:10:16,420 --> 02:10:39,909
of a zebra, right? Where are my binoculars? Where the fuck are the

1021
02:10:39,909 --> 02:10:44,399
zebras? We just drove in a circle. I didn't see one

1022
02:10:44,399 --> 02:10:55,279
zebra. He just wanted to show me the cheetah and then take me home.

1023
02:10:55,279 --> 02:11:06,630
I'm definitely gonna get an email about cheetahs.

1024
02:11:06,630 --> 02:11:11,750
Alright, we're home. That was fun. That was good to see the... I'm glad we got to see

1025
02:11:11,750 --> 02:11:20,130
the cheetah. Email me about it tomorrow. Hold on a minute.

1026
02:11:20,130 --> 02:11:30,520
Alright, let's get... let's make some fucked up shit happen here.

1027
02:11:30,520 --> 02:11:58,159
Oh, look! I got a picture of that! That's so funny. That's such a ridiculous

1028
02:11:58,159 --> 02:12:04,520
shutter. Alright, let me go get the email about the

1029
02:12:04,520 --> 02:12:18,800
fucking cheetah. That was great today, but I didn't do anything.

1030
02:12:18,800 --> 02:12:27,399
You drove around in a circle. You encountered cheetah? Well, I'll write up the report.

1031
02:12:27,399 --> 02:12:36,880
Go to bed. Nah, I don't want to transfer these photos. I'm just making a joke.

1032
02:12:36,880 --> 02:12:46,039
He's like trying to get in the photo. You know,

1033
02:12:46,039 --> 02:12:50,039
the aperture is bad, but it makes it kind of

1034
02:12:50,039 --> 02:12:54,039
good. If only the shutter wasn't so stupid and I didn't have like a photo bomb

1035
02:12:54,039 --> 02:13:00,819
here. I think I'm gonna have to keep this one. No, no, no, no.

1036
02:13:00,819 --> 02:13:11,329
Okay, just go to bed. I'm gonna take a picture of a cheetah

1037
02:13:11,329 --> 02:13:20,760
stalking prey tomorrow or something, right? Okay, we got a new email

1038
02:13:20,760 --> 02:13:27,159
that's gonna be about a cheetah. Just you wait. Hunting at 60 miles

1039
02:13:27,159 --> 02:13:31,699
per hour. Mm-hmm. This is Peter O'Brien over at

1040
02:13:31,699 --> 02:13:36,000
National Geographic. Next month's feature is about hunters of the savanna.

1041
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:40,000
And we want to talk about how cheetahs hunt. We'd like you to handle the photography.

1042
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:44,000
The cheetah tears after its prey at 60 miles an hour.

1043
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:48,000
You only get one moment to take the shot. It's an important job, but I know you're up to it.

1044
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:58,630
This is apparently one of the harder difficulty ones.

1045
02:13:58,630 --> 02:14:08,930
I only get one chance. I didn't get a picture of a cheetah. Okay.

1046
02:14:08,930 --> 02:14:12,930
So I'm gonna save it here because I should.

1047
02:14:12,930 --> 02:14:17,109
And I'm also gonna go to the bathroom. So I'm gonna say it's gonna take, by the time this is done,

1048
02:14:17,109 --> 02:14:21,109
I'll be back. So let me just take a piss break. I'll be right back.

1049
02:14:21,109 --> 02:16:58,049
See you guys in a second. Alright. Have we saved? Good.

1050
02:16:58,049 --> 02:17:20,129
Alright. We've been asked to photograph a cheetah. Could you try to find that cheetah

1051
02:17:20,129 --> 02:17:24,129
again? This one's up to you. Hope you can get that perfect picture.

1052
02:17:24,129 --> 02:17:28,500
Did I accept the mission? Make sure I just accepted it.

1053
02:17:28,500 --> 02:17:38,610
Yeah. So do I need to take a photo of it killing something?

1054
02:17:38,610 --> 02:17:47,200
Or take a photo of it when it's about to kill something?

1055
02:17:47,200 --> 02:17:53,860
I'm gonna have to drop the shutter too. And do a burst photo. 60 miles per hour

1056
02:17:53,860 --> 02:18:03,409
I get one second. A photo of it about to kill you.

1057
02:18:03,409 --> 02:18:12,520
Take a selfie while being eaten at 60 miles per

1058
02:18:12,520 --> 02:18:21,040
fresh beer. I'm gonna say that every fucking time.

1059
02:18:21,040 --> 02:18:25,540
Looking for a cheetah. Let's try the ant hill. There was a cheetah in that area

1060
02:18:25,540 --> 02:18:41,670
before. Let's get in here. Continue shooting on

1061
02:18:41,670 --> 02:19:00,479
standard. Let's see what's going on here.

1062
02:19:00,479 --> 02:19:10,850
Let's see those photos. It's going too fast. Can I drop it?

1063
02:19:10,850 --> 02:19:21,920
Can I drop that? I couldn't go

1064
02:19:21,920 --> 02:19:35,809
up to these values before. I could not pick these before.

1065
02:19:35,809 --> 02:19:44,020
They're dark. I gotta bring the... Hold on.

1066
02:19:44,020 --> 02:19:49,459
We gotta open up the fucking eye a little bit here.

1067
02:19:49,459 --> 02:19:55,170
Is that gonna help? Nah. Fuck. We need exposure composition.

1068
02:19:55,170 --> 02:20:06,559
Exposure. Exposure plus one.

1069
02:20:06,559 --> 02:20:28,770
Fuck. The shutter's too high. It's too high.

1070
02:20:28,770 --> 02:20:43,280
Let's try this. It's not terrible. Let's try that.

1071
02:20:43,280 --> 02:20:49,510
320.

1072
02:20:49,510 --> 02:20:56,879
That looks okay. That looks okay. Alright. That doesn't look bad.

1073
02:20:56,879 --> 02:21:01,639
Adjust the aperture. God damn. I gotta do full manual here.

1074
02:21:01,639 --> 02:21:09,329
That's as much as I can go. I can't do exposure.

1075
02:21:09,329 --> 02:21:13,569
I gotta do it on shutter speed priority. Three and a half is as far as I can get it.

1076
02:21:13,569 --> 02:21:25,219
That doesn't look terrible. Okay. Nobody home at the anthill.

1077
02:21:25,219 --> 02:21:37,760
Let's try the oasis. Oh fuck. I have two. I gotta get

1078
02:21:37,760 --> 02:21:41,760
rid of these. How do I delete these? We're good. We're good. We're good.

1079
02:21:41,760 --> 02:21:47,409
The aperture cannot go lower than 3.5 on this camera.

1080
02:21:47,409 --> 02:22:12,370
Looking over there. Shooting. Auto review.

1081
02:22:12,370 --> 02:22:26,180
Those look cool. Let me make sure this...

1082
02:22:26,180 --> 02:22:35,719
Now that's gonna be fine. Not gonna be blurry before the

1083
02:22:35,719 --> 02:22:43,350
cheetah. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Stop the car. Stop the car. Stop the car.

1084
02:22:43,350 --> 02:22:47,350
Stop. Stop the car. Why can I not tell you to stop the car?

1085
02:22:47,350 --> 02:22:52,040
Get me off the rails. Why?

1086
02:22:52,040 --> 02:23:00,420
I wanna stop. It's an opportunity to get a picture of a zebra. Fuck. I'm gonna get one

1087
02:23:00,420 --> 02:23:06,899
opportunity and I'm gonna blow this. I got three shots continuously

1088
02:23:06,899 --> 02:23:10,899
in a row. As long as I can get a decent one I'll be fine. No sign of a cheetah.

1089
02:23:10,899 --> 02:23:19,600
You try to spot a cheetah using the binoculars.

1090
02:23:19,600 --> 02:23:33,409
Okay. I'm just gonna drive through the animals.

1091
02:23:33,409 --> 02:23:44,370
I don't see a cheetah. I don't even need to use the binoculars. This is Star Wars music.

1092
02:23:44,370 --> 02:23:55,520
It is. You're right. It is Star Wars music. This is specifically like

1093
02:23:55,520 --> 02:23:59,959
Obi-Wan. The crescendo of this is every time

1094
02:23:59,959 --> 02:24:03,959
Obi-Wan does a gigantic force front flip or back flip

1095
02:24:03,959 --> 02:24:08,319
onto another ledge. I'll give you an example here.

1096
02:24:08,319 --> 02:24:12,319
There he goes. He swings the lightsaber.

1097
02:24:12,319 --> 02:24:16,319
There's the back flip. Up. Maybe two levels above the enemy.

1098
02:24:16,319 --> 02:24:20,319
And he stays there and looks down and turns his lightsaber off.

1099
02:24:20,319 --> 02:24:24,629
And then turns around and he goes down another direction. So it's always a back flip or a front flip.

1100
02:24:24,629 --> 02:24:46,450
I just wanna look for a fucking cheetah. What the fuck is this cheetah?

1101
02:24:46,450 --> 02:24:51,010
Cheetah! Oh aren't those... What?

1102
02:24:51,010 --> 02:24:57,920
That's a cheetah right there. Isn't that a cheetah? That's not a cheetah.

1103
02:24:57,920 --> 02:25:12,049
Cheetah. Oh look they're... Oh you're just saying the things that I point the camera at.

1104
02:25:12,049 --> 02:25:16,549
Found it! Cheetah! Cheetah! Cheetah! There it is.

1105
02:25:16,549 --> 02:25:23,459
Okay I gotta get ready. Alright set it up. I got one chance.

1106
02:25:23,459 --> 02:25:30,260
Can I bring this into Photoshop later and fuck with it or no? Looking up at prey on top of the anthill.

1107
02:25:30,260 --> 02:25:35,270
It might start a chase. Let's get closer.

1108
02:25:35,270 --> 02:25:42,319
It has its eyes on a Thompson's gazelle.

1109
02:25:42,319 --> 02:25:49,360
Because you can't really make sure you have enough photos left. I'll follow along

1110
02:25:49,360 --> 02:26:00,709
Let's try when the cheetah starts running. Get that perfect shot.

1111
02:26:00,709 --> 02:26:05,010
Big game number one. Snap a cheetah hunting. Is the camera gonna already be open?

1112
02:26:05,010 --> 02:26:14,239
I only have like three seconds to get this correct.

1113
02:26:14,239 --> 02:26:22,959
This is not the cutscene anymore. Where is he? Where's the cheetah?

1114
02:26:22,959 --> 02:26:59,059
What are you doing? Oh! Look at that one.

1115
02:26:59,059 --> 02:27:08,899
You really have to do that? Is he three times?

1116
02:27:08,899 --> 02:27:13,909
That is not the best one. That's not the best one.

1117
02:27:13,909 --> 02:27:21,989
Looks like they're doing a conga line. This one sucks.

1118
02:27:21,989 --> 02:27:28,340
That was one fantastic hunt. You must have gotten some great photos.

1119
02:27:28,340 --> 02:27:38,770
There's no blood. Now this game was to

1120
02:27:38,770 --> 02:27:53,379
educate children how to use cameras. Specifically from Sony.

1121
02:27:53,379 --> 02:27:57,559
Got it. Ready to go home. Now if you see

1122
02:27:57,559 --> 02:28:02,930
a zebra, stop the car.

1123
02:28:02,930 --> 02:28:11,010
So I can get that too. Where are all the explosions?

1124
02:28:11,010 --> 02:28:18,120
This game is bullshit. Where are the fucking TIE fighters?

1125
02:28:18,120 --> 02:28:28,159
Zebras? I'm never gonna get that close with a zebra's face.

1126
02:28:28,159 --> 02:28:35,459
Put on different music. I can't put on custom music.

1127
02:28:35,459 --> 02:28:41,989
No! We have to deal with the same Star Wars track

1128
02:28:41,989 --> 02:28:46,290
over and over again. You're just watching your favorite scene.

1129
02:28:46,290 --> 02:28:50,290
You're watching the General Grievous scene over and over again.

1130
02:28:50,290 --> 02:28:55,809
In fact, I think he does it in the General Grievous scene.

1131
02:28:55,809 --> 02:29:16,040
No, it actually happens in that scene. Let's see.

1132
02:29:16,040 --> 02:29:20,040
It's not gonna be a copyright problem. Don't worry. I just need to get to the one part that I think is gonna happen.

1133
02:29:20,040 --> 02:29:33,079
Give me a sec. Let's get it on screen.

1134
02:29:33,079 --> 02:29:50,399
And here it comes.

1135
02:29:50,399 --> 02:29:55,219
Where is it? Come on. He jumps down. Does he jump

1136
02:29:55,219 --> 02:30:00,790
up? Why is this big backflip that he does up? I know

1137
02:30:00,790 --> 02:30:15,190
what happens. Here, look. I'll show you. You've never seen Star Wars before

1138
02:30:15,190 --> 02:30:25,559
than just fucking whatever.

1139
02:30:29,559 --> 02:30:35,139
No, no. I can't play this. I gotta stop this now. Stop.

1140
02:30:35,139 --> 02:30:53,059
No, no. That was less than ten seconds. Okay, hold on. Where's the jump? Update your

1141
02:30:53,059 --> 02:31:18,319
mic. Here it comes. Here we go.

1142
02:31:18,319 --> 02:31:46,420
I'm not gonna get in trouble. That was like five seconds.

1143
02:31:46,420 --> 02:32:00,819
I sorta fucking sneeze of the movie. We were looking for when he jumps

1144
02:32:00,819 --> 02:32:07,159
backwards or forwards and he jumps forwards. I'm not gonna get in trouble.

1145
02:32:07,159 --> 02:32:12,360
I showed fucking four seconds of a movie that came out like forty years ago.

1146
02:32:12,360 --> 02:32:20,819
Twenty years ago. There are people that like stream

1147
02:32:20,819 --> 02:32:27,940
all the Harry fucking Potter movies on Twitch. I don't think we have to be

1148
02:32:27,940 --> 02:32:35,959
concerned about like eight seconds. Like you can find like

1149
02:32:35,959 --> 02:32:39,959
whole fucking movie streams. Like super illegal movie streams.

1150
02:32:39,959 --> 02:32:49,729
Watching like all the Lord of the Rings. Let's see what we got.

1151
02:32:49,729 --> 02:33:02,790
Your best shot. Really? The one. Let's reply.

1152
02:33:02,790 --> 02:33:08,120
Which one? How is that not a good shot? This is great.

1153
02:33:08,120 --> 02:33:18,870
This is like showing the kill. Doesn't really fell over.

1154
02:33:18,870 --> 02:33:36,149
That one's good. Apparently they think it's this one. The first one.

1155
02:33:36,149 --> 02:33:44,290
I guess is the better one. He was then laid a band from Twitch.

1156
02:33:44,290 --> 02:33:51,159
For those four seconds of copyright material. We're gonna use this one. This is the one

1157
02:33:51,159 --> 02:34:02,049
that the video game is determined is the best one so I'm gonna use it.

1158
02:34:02,049 --> 02:34:13,250
That's pretty good. Yeah we got the algorithm in our favor.

1159
02:34:13,250 --> 02:34:19,799
I still need to do this one. I got a lot of money. I should buy something.

1160
02:34:19,799 --> 02:34:23,799
I'm just hoarding all of my cash right now. For no reason.

1161
02:34:23,799 --> 02:34:36,659
Unless eventually I can buy something better. But what does this frame do?

1162
02:34:36,659 --> 02:34:45,379
Put the, say for a ten foot lens.

1163
02:34:45,379 --> 02:34:50,639
I mean we could. What did the client think about the photo you sent them, Princey?

1164
02:34:50,639 --> 02:34:57,700
Well we crossed a milestone in our survey. We should get some rest.

1165
02:34:58,700 --> 02:35:19,100
Alright, hold on, hold on. I'm buying it.

1166
02:35:19,100 --> 02:35:46,360
I hung up the photo frame in the back. Perfect!

1167
02:35:46,360 --> 02:35:53,360
Let's see what the new task is. Sending map of new research area.

1168
02:35:53,360 --> 02:35:59,069
We have taken a detailed map of the wetlands adjacent to the Duma step.

1169
02:35:59,069 --> 02:36:03,069
In the area they refer to them as the Kiboko Swamp.

1170
02:36:03,069 --> 02:36:07,069
The rich water supply draws a number of animal inhabitants.

1171
02:36:07,069 --> 02:36:11,069
Especially those who thrive along the water's edge. Please focus your efforts in this new area starting today.

1172
02:36:11,069 --> 02:36:20,540
I'm literally turning, I'm getting, I'm like sixty.

1173
02:36:20,540 --> 02:36:24,540
I used to never have to have this problem.

1174
02:36:24,540 --> 02:36:31,530
When you get like a little older, it shit just happens man. I can't, I just, I'm old.

1175
02:36:31,530 --> 02:36:37,120
I'm getting older. You ever listen to the noises your fucking grandfather makes?

1176
02:36:37,120 --> 02:36:41,420
When he's just sitting there?

1177
02:36:41,420 --> 02:36:45,420
He's got like his hands together and he's just got his thumbs down and he's just like sitting there just relaxing.

1178
02:36:45,420 --> 02:36:49,420
And all of a sudden he just goes like...

1179
02:36:49,420 --> 02:36:58,590
I don't know what that's like. I get it now.

1180
02:36:58,590 --> 02:37:04,920
Sometimes I'll just be like...

1181
02:37:04,920 --> 02:37:12,030
I understand.

1182
02:37:12,030 --> 02:37:16,909
Please focus your efforts on this new area starting today.

1183
02:37:16,909 --> 02:37:23,709
Wait actually, I can send an email to Cheetah.

1184
02:37:23,709 --> 02:37:30,670
Any new animal is just three thousand dollars. Let's get a good one here of the Cheetah.

1185
02:37:30,670 --> 02:37:35,979
No, no. What the hell is that?

1186
02:37:35,979 --> 02:37:44,889
That's good. That's a good photo, but it's not of a Cheetah.

1187
02:37:44,889 --> 02:37:53,530
Unfortunately I have to use one of the ones.

1188
02:37:53,530 --> 02:37:57,530
One of these ones here. Like this one.

1189
02:37:57,530 --> 02:38:02,520
This one's probably good. Or that one. I'll do this one.

1190
02:38:02,520 --> 02:38:14,860
Framing's pretty terrible, but whatever. I'm gonna get the money anyway. Nevermind.

1191
02:38:14,860 --> 02:38:20,239
Alright, it's time to explore the wetlands. I can join you in the field starting today.

1192
02:38:20,239 --> 02:38:29,260
It took you like five days. Let's head to the swamp.

1193
02:38:29,260 --> 02:38:34,780
A zoomer streamer pukes on keyboard. Am I not a zoomer?

1194
02:38:34,780 --> 02:38:46,489
I'm not a boomer either. I am a

1195
02:38:46,489 --> 02:39:03,899
millennial. He's a zoom beanie.

1196
02:39:03,899 --> 02:39:07,899
I'll drive us to the Kiboko Swamp.

1197
02:39:07,899 --> 02:39:14,569
Francine, you just take the backseat and enjoy the sights.

1198
02:39:14,569 --> 02:39:27,129
Where's James? You drive like shit. Can I please bring James back?

1199
02:39:27,129 --> 02:39:47,100
We gotta go back and change some shit here. Enjoy the sights.

1200
02:39:47,100 --> 02:39:54,139
I wonder if I can get some cool shots here.

1201
02:39:54,139 --> 02:40:06,440
Just in case something crazy happens.

1202
02:40:06,440 --> 02:40:14,010
Is this that Vive game he was talking about? No, the reason I didn't do Vive today is because

1203
02:40:14,010 --> 02:40:18,010
I did not know if I was even going to be able to stream.

1204
02:40:18,010 --> 02:40:22,879
I didn't want to have a scenario where I can turn the stream on and the internet's

1205
02:40:22,879 --> 02:40:26,879
still fucked up. But I'm like all set up in a Vive VR room.

1206
02:40:26,879 --> 02:40:30,879
And the stream goes down in like 45 minutes.

1207
02:40:30,879 --> 02:40:36,889
I figure I would do this today and then do the Vive

1208
02:40:36,889 --> 02:40:40,889
hopefully tomorrow if his internet still works. I don't know. It's going to be tough

1209
02:40:40,889 --> 02:40:44,889
because it seems that we're having other issues too with

1210
02:40:44,889 --> 02:40:48,889
how our bandwidth is being split between

1211
02:40:48,889 --> 02:40:52,889
because Italics is here as well. So it's almost like we have two computers running

1212
02:40:52,889 --> 02:40:56,889
at the same time. One just can kill the other now.

1213
02:40:56,889 --> 02:41:00,889
So I don't know why. So I don't know. We might have to do a situation where

1214
02:41:00,889 --> 02:41:04,889
we try to take turns using the broken internet.

1215
02:41:04,889 --> 02:41:14,379
We'll have to figure that out. Hopefully it just works because it seems to be working now.

1216
02:41:14,379 --> 02:41:18,620
I thought that was a Twitch logo.

1217
02:41:18,620 --> 02:41:22,620
I think he tried to do something on the internet and that's

1218
02:41:22,620 --> 02:41:27,760
when we dropped like a thousand, two thousand frames. Weird. I don't know.

1219
02:41:27,760 --> 02:41:31,760
I can't explain it. The map from the head office indicates that Keeq Boko Swamp

1220
02:41:31,760 --> 02:41:47,959
lies this way. Let's go. And it's definitely not a problem with any of our

1221
02:41:47,959 --> 02:41:52,719
equipment because we've had the same shit for four months.

1222
02:41:52,719 --> 02:41:57,770
And we haven't really had a problem that we had to deal with this before.

1223
02:41:57,770 --> 02:42:01,770
All this shit started three days ago when the whole internet just

1224
02:42:01,770 --> 02:42:06,909
cut off, turned off to zero. And then I was told by

1225
02:42:06,909 --> 02:42:10,909
people at Cox that we have like a packet loss problem

1226
02:42:10,909 --> 02:42:14,909
and they were going to fix it and they were going to work on it. I don't know. Maybe they're still doing that.

1227
02:42:14,909 --> 02:42:18,909
We're getting some fallout from the weather maybe. I don't know.

1228
02:42:18,909 --> 02:42:22,909
We're just going to try. We're going to do what we can do. That's all we can do.

1229
02:42:22,909 --> 02:42:42,219
All right. What an incredible sight we're at the swamp.

1230
02:42:42,219 --> 02:42:47,079
That's a nice photo. That photo was terrible but that was a nice looking photo.

1231
02:42:47,079 --> 02:43:01,739
Any other animals in the swamp?

1232
02:43:01,739 --> 02:43:11,420
Eric follows the GPS into a lake.

1233
02:43:11,420 --> 02:43:17,069
That climbing shrub is called a water tree.

1234
02:43:17,069 --> 02:43:21,879
That tree looks like an easy one to climb. We're going to climb the tree.

1235
02:43:21,879 --> 02:43:29,899
Climb a tree to conceal yourself from the animals.

1236
02:43:29,899 --> 02:43:42,120
I'm not going to get the equipment to go up here. I'm just going to drive by it.

1237
02:43:42,120 --> 02:43:47,319
See Francine, this right here is a lake. It's a swamp.

1238
02:43:47,319 --> 02:43:51,319
The swamp is much larger than I expected. Why don't you take the wheel from here?

1239
02:43:51,319 --> 02:43:56,700
Why don't I take the wheel from here? What? I have to drive the car now.

1240
02:43:56,700 --> 02:44:09,629
How do I drive it? Just went up a whole letter grid.

1241
02:44:09,629 --> 02:44:15,340
What do you want me to do? Can I dump them?

1242
02:44:15,340 --> 02:44:28,219
What do you want me to do? Take the wheel to do what?

1243
02:44:28,219 --> 02:44:39,420
I can't take any pictures. Look, I could have gotten those swans.

1244
02:44:39,420 --> 02:44:54,010
I'm going to climb the tree?

1245
02:44:54,010 --> 02:45:05,040
This looks like a battery powered toy car.

1246
02:45:05,040 --> 02:45:11,319
It does look like a power wheel. What the fuck am I looking for?

1247
02:45:24,190 --> 02:45:45,360
I'm just up on a tree. What are we doing this for?

1248
02:45:45,360 --> 02:45:53,610
Here we go. Fly right down into me.

1249
02:45:53,610 --> 02:46:05,389
Fly down, down, down, down, right into me.

1250
02:46:05,389 --> 02:46:14,139
Not terrible. A lot of birds.

1251
02:46:14,139 --> 02:46:40,329
These photos are not very good.

1252
02:46:40,329 --> 02:47:06,059
Let me take a look at that one. That might be the best photo I've taken.

1253
02:47:06,059 --> 02:47:10,059
It was a snap. Look at the background.

1254
02:47:10,059 --> 02:47:14,559
Look at his wings are a little bit out of focus. What his beak is.

1255
02:47:14,559 --> 02:47:27,610
Great photo. What about all the birds?

1256
02:47:27,610 --> 02:47:37,260
I think there's more than one.

1257
02:47:37,260 --> 02:47:43,100
Take a selfie. Selfies didn't exist.

1258
02:47:43,100 --> 02:47:47,100
This game came out in 2008. Selfies were not a thing that made any sense.

1259
02:47:47,100 --> 02:48:01,239
Selfies did not exist.

1260
02:48:01,239 --> 02:48:18,399
There was no picture camera that you could hold in your hand and turn that way.

1261
02:48:18,399 --> 02:48:36,440
I can get closer than that. Just T-Posed.

1262
02:48:36,440 --> 02:49:26,620
Right here. Slow down.

1263
02:49:26,620 --> 02:49:41,790
Right there. That's the one.

1264
02:49:41,790 --> 02:50:31,879
I had it. It was close.

1265
02:50:31,879 --> 02:50:36,959
Eric! Eric!

1266
02:50:36,959 --> 02:50:42,840
Where's Eric? Where's the car?

1267
02:50:42,840 --> 02:51:14,459
No! Do I get to keep my photos?

1268
02:51:14,459 --> 02:51:30,329
That picture of the

1269
02:51:30,329 --> 02:51:34,829
bird is gone.

1270
02:51:34,829 --> 02:51:42,459
That was the best picture I've ever taken.

1271
02:51:42,459 --> 02:51:46,459
Camping tent. Spend the night in the field and get an early start the next morning. An outdoorsman's best friend.

1272
02:51:46,459 --> 02:51:58,680
That sucks. That actually sucks.

1273
02:51:58,680 --> 02:52:27,020
I'm going to buy it. Let's get the tent. Why does the buffalo wipe the camera?

1274
02:52:27,020 --> 02:52:32,219
I don't know. I'm so disappointed right now.

1275
02:52:32,219 --> 02:52:47,959
Why would Eric save the photographer and not the photos?

1276
02:52:47,959 --> 02:53:02,940
At the end of the day, I matter not the footage.

1277
02:53:02,940 --> 02:53:07,239
Buffalo took the SD card. No, I think it's what it's implied.

1278
02:53:07,239 --> 02:53:14,920
Because your camera gets stomped. Those are some good photos too.

1279
02:53:14,920 --> 02:53:34,379
What? Why?

1280
02:53:34,379 --> 02:53:38,809
We've got to go back to the wetlands. I need to go explore and take some good photos.

1281
02:53:38,809 --> 02:53:45,420
Go get revenge. What? Go run over the buffalo.

1282
02:53:45,420 --> 02:53:50,299
I've got to go get my SD card back.

1283
02:53:50,299 --> 02:53:59,639
We can't flip the car, right? Where is this heading?

1284
02:53:59,639 --> 02:54:24,860
This is a different zone too. Heading towards...

1285
02:54:24,860 --> 02:54:32,750
I've got to get my souls back. I'm glad I actually had to drive though.

1286
02:54:32,750 --> 02:54:54,120
That was annoying. Having to wait for someone to drive you around.

1287
02:54:54,120 --> 02:54:58,120
At what point does Eric start to say...

1288
02:54:58,120 --> 02:55:02,489
Watch out! Hey now, watch your driving!

1289
02:55:02,489 --> 02:55:07,440
There it is. Please don't do that.

1290
02:55:07,440 --> 02:55:11,440
That's Jay Leno, by the way.

1291
02:55:11,440 --> 02:55:24,989
I might as well put the chicken in my head around.

1292
02:55:24,989 --> 02:55:30,379
Let's find a place to stop. I can't believe I lost the picture.

1293
02:55:30,379 --> 02:55:34,379
The gull. The pelican.

1294
02:55:34,379 --> 02:55:38,379
Or the swan. Or the flamingo.

1295
02:55:38,379 --> 02:55:47,799
One of the birds have the weird long sock necks.

1296
02:55:47,799 --> 02:56:02,600
Get out of the car. Let's get a good one from far away.

1297
02:56:02,600 --> 02:56:10,090
Wait, wait, wait.

1298
02:56:10,090 --> 02:56:14,090
I've got to get closer, otherwise I have to drop the aperture.

1299
02:56:14,090 --> 02:56:27,899
That's one drinking right there.

1300
02:56:27,899 --> 02:56:42,299
I've got to get closer. Do not get fucking killed again over this.

1301
02:56:42,299 --> 02:56:47,690
Not bad. I've got the fucking photo I need.

1302
02:56:47,690 --> 02:57:07,530
What are you doing? That's too dark. He's going manual!

1303
02:57:07,530 --> 02:57:14,719
It's too dark. I'm not sticking around. I've got what I needed.

1304
02:57:14,719 --> 02:57:25,659
Now I've got to get a couple photos of...

1305
02:57:25,659 --> 02:57:30,989
Can I take a photo right now if the car has stopped? Or do I have to get out of the car?

1306
02:57:30,989 --> 02:57:38,280
This guy's not going to knock the Jeep over, is he?

1307
02:57:38,280 --> 02:57:46,620
I need to get the birds.

1308
02:57:46,620 --> 02:58:01,340
I'm so pissed off that I lost those.

1309
02:58:01,340 --> 02:58:05,340
Hey, is this the streamer that photographed a wild buffalo on manual?

1310
02:58:05,340 --> 02:58:21,100
Not yet. He has a driver's ed brake.

1311
02:58:21,100 --> 02:58:30,440
I think that's what's going on.

1312
02:58:30,440 --> 02:58:34,440
The head office hasn't sent us maps for this area yet.

1313
02:58:34,440 --> 02:58:43,040
I've got the buffalo. I need the flying birds. Can I climb these trees?

1314
02:58:43,040 --> 02:58:52,250
I'm going to take the fucking pictures all over again.

1315
02:58:52,250 --> 02:59:00,510
Let's get this back up.

1316
02:59:00,510 --> 02:59:08,959
The birds are going to be flying around. I need some good speed.

1317
02:59:08,959 --> 02:59:18,879
Climb tree. Can I only climb certain trees?

1318
02:59:18,879 --> 02:59:30,139
Is that what I'm missing here? I can't climb this?

1319
02:59:30,139 --> 02:59:48,170
I guess I can. Why the hell not?

1320
02:59:48,170 --> 02:59:55,159
What tree should I go to, then? What happened to the Jeep?

1321
02:59:55,159 --> 03:00:12,440
I was going to say, what? How does it camouflage?

1322
03:00:12,440 --> 03:00:24,989
Let's try the other tree. This one down here. The big ones, probably.

1323
03:00:24,989 --> 03:00:30,959
I did different gazelles.

1324
03:00:30,959 --> 03:00:35,319
I'm going to get up in that tree right there. That's a good spot.

1325
03:00:35,319 --> 03:00:54,010
Climb trees.

1326
03:00:54,010 --> 03:00:58,010
Can I not climb the tree unless he tells me to climb the tree?

1327
03:00:58,010 --> 03:01:04,680
Is there one tree I can get on? I don't think I can get on any tree but the one in the middle.

1328
03:01:04,680 --> 03:01:17,479
What about this one? I don't see a prompt or anything.

1329
03:01:17,479 --> 03:01:34,040
Nice FPS, bro!

1330
03:01:34,040 --> 03:01:55,850
There's a hole in that one.

1331
03:01:55,850 --> 03:02:06,879
I'm going in the tree.

1332
03:02:06,879 --> 03:02:16,780
Why am I doing this?

1333
03:02:16,780 --> 03:02:26,379
Do I live here now? Am I baiting somebody out?

1334
03:02:26,379 --> 03:02:40,440
I'm hiding here. What am I hiding from?

1335
03:02:40,440 --> 03:02:57,600
This one has horns. Gotta get closer.

1336
03:02:57,600 --> 03:03:55,450
Just in case you run away, let me get one. I'm just bored in this venue.

1337
03:03:55,450 --> 03:04:09,280
Some of those were good. Now I just need the bird.

1338
03:04:09,280 --> 03:04:29,100
Go get in the tree. That's why we shoot raw.

1339
03:04:29,100 --> 03:04:36,030
I really wish I had a picture of one of the gulls but I don't.

1340
03:04:36,030 --> 03:04:52,159
I can probably get a shitty picture of one of these birds.

1341
03:04:52,159 --> 03:04:56,159
I get it. I know, I know. You don't have to hold down the fucking instructor break.

1342
03:04:56,159 --> 03:05:02,700
Just get a zoom in.

1343
03:05:02,700 --> 03:05:09,739
It looks like shit. I don't even care. I just have to get them collected.

1344
03:05:09,739 --> 03:05:30,729
Whatever. I want to do another one of those cheetah missions. That was really cool.

1345
03:05:30,729 --> 03:05:39,879
The cheetah mission only gave you a certain amount of time.

1346
03:05:39,879 --> 03:05:46,239
What happened to the Star Wars music? That's true.

1347
03:05:46,239 --> 03:06:00,829
It kind of just disappeared. Why did the music disappear? I couldn't tell you.

1348
03:06:00,829 --> 03:06:17,530
I have no idea. That was music for James.

1349
03:06:17,530 --> 03:06:24,639
It took a long time to load that. Area secured, we got this one.

1350
03:06:24,639 --> 03:06:32,510
Back to the camp. I honestly don't even know where the camp is.

1351
03:06:32,510 --> 03:06:58,040
There it is. You don't get stuck like this. I don't even know where the save point was.

1352
03:06:58,040 --> 03:07:09,370
Get up there. This is really

1353
03:07:09,370 --> 03:07:17,559
electrical powered. Four by four.

1354
03:07:17,559 --> 03:07:31,399
Can we get out of the car? Hey, thanks. Whoa, somehow we pulled free.

1355
03:07:31,399 --> 03:07:36,860
Wow. Thank you World of Warcraft Game Master.

1356
03:07:36,860 --> 03:07:42,170
Appreciate that. Now I got stuck in Iron Forge again.

1357
03:07:42,170 --> 03:07:52,280
How do I go back to camp? It's starting to get dark.

1358
03:07:52,280 --> 03:07:56,829
Can we get out of the car? End. Okay, here we go.

1359
03:07:56,829 --> 03:08:08,479
End Safari. Oh my god. You can just teleport.

1360
03:08:15,860 --> 03:08:26,479
This is so bad. Which one's worse?

1361
03:08:26,479 --> 03:08:32,049
That's pretty good. That's not so good.

1362
03:08:32,049 --> 03:08:36,479
Neither is that. This one is good. That one's really good.

1363
03:08:36,479 --> 03:08:46,680
I'd say this is the one I'm going to send. I'm not looking for good scores, I just want to have the database.

1364
03:08:46,680 --> 03:08:53,409
So I get the mission to do it. There's a Pelican. I got it right.

1365
03:08:53,409 --> 03:09:16,200
That one's good. Three grand. I'll take it.

1366
03:09:16,200 --> 03:09:25,600
That's an Impala. What else we got? The buffaloes, right?

1367
03:09:25,600 --> 03:09:32,219
These are different. This is the male and female, right?

1368
03:09:32,219 --> 03:09:38,700
Oh, this is different. Bad angle. Why is this a bad angle?

1369
03:09:38,700 --> 03:09:55,790
We got the buffaloes. The one that's the most in focus is the one over there.

1370
03:09:55,790 --> 03:10:04,569
To the left. You can take this one.

1371
03:10:04,569 --> 03:10:20,000
African Buffalo. Are there any others? I don't think so.

1372
03:10:20,000 --> 03:10:24,239
I got the gull. I'm going to hold on to these though.

1373
03:10:24,239 --> 03:10:29,930
This one in particular. Get rid of the shitty ones.

1374
03:10:29,930 --> 03:10:34,430
Get rid of all the shitty buffalo ones. What is this? A bush.

1375
03:10:34,430 --> 03:10:39,159
Just get rid of this one too. Hold on to these ones because I like them.

1376
03:10:39,159 --> 03:10:49,040
Got to keep that one. And that looks good.

1377
03:10:49,040 --> 03:10:59,979
Alright. Go to bed. See if I actually have a mission tomorrow.

1378
03:10:59,979 --> 03:11:08,040
Check the email. There we go. Whoa, that's a lot.

1379
03:11:08,040 --> 03:11:12,280
Photo for nature power. Could you get a giraffe at eye level?

1380
03:11:12,280 --> 03:11:19,069
What? How are you tree climbing skills? I've got a job for you.

1381
03:11:19,069 --> 03:11:23,069
I need a close up of a giraffe's face, but not just any close up. I kind of

1382
03:11:23,069 --> 03:11:27,069
promised my boss I'd get him a shot taken from tree level. Can you bail me out?

1383
03:11:27,069 --> 03:11:33,790
If I can climb a tree, maybe. Hello Francine.

1384
03:11:33,790 --> 03:11:37,790
My name is Javi Salgado and I represent NINP Publishing.

1385
03:11:37,790 --> 03:11:41,790
It's a pleasure to meet you. We plan to introduce readers to the African Buffalo

1386
03:11:41,790 --> 03:11:45,790
in one of our upcoming magazines. You think you could provide a photo? Try and get as close to a

1387
03:11:45,790 --> 03:11:49,790
vicious buffalo as you can. We want a tense shot.

1388
03:11:49,790 --> 03:11:59,129
You saw what happened last time. You're familiar with an animal called the impala.

1389
03:11:59,129 --> 03:12:03,690
Each male is what you might call a player. He forms a harem

1390
03:12:03,690 --> 03:12:10,409
of multiple females.

1391
03:12:10,409 --> 03:12:14,409
Photograph one of these harems. Look for the male's magnificent horns and please

1392
03:12:14,409 --> 03:12:18,840
make sure both male and female are in frame. What's this for?

1393
03:12:18,840 --> 03:12:26,280
Am I just going to send this to this guy? Oh hey, can you show that? That's for me.

1394
03:12:26,280 --> 03:12:35,690
It doesn't say what it's for. Yeah, there's no official reason

1395
03:12:35,690 --> 03:12:42,409
for these photos. Okay, well whatever.

1396
03:12:42,409 --> 03:12:49,530
A giraffe at eye level is more interesting. I'm going to take this one first. And then we're looking for

1397
03:12:49,530 --> 03:12:53,530
what we can get that. We still need a close up of a zebra's face.

1398
03:12:53,530 --> 03:12:57,530
I don't think we're going to get that though. Let me get this.

1399
03:12:57,530 --> 03:13:19,549
Find a tree we can climb. Well, interestingly enough,

1400
03:13:19,549 --> 03:13:26,079
I think the internet has been incredibly stable. So cross your

1401
03:13:26,079 --> 03:13:31,260
fingers that today's test stream

1402
03:13:31,260 --> 03:13:41,899
can carry us into tomorrow and the next day. Hopefully.

1403
03:13:41,899 --> 03:13:45,899
I wasn't even going to stream today. I was going to just not do it.

1404
03:13:45,899 --> 03:13:56,159
It looks like we might be good to go. Who just drove in front of my car?

1405
03:13:56,159 --> 03:14:12,030
Oh my god. Why are you doing this to me?

1406
03:14:12,030 --> 03:14:16,030
You thought this was going to be a transition into five? Well, I can't really do that right now.

1407
03:14:16,030 --> 03:14:20,590
Because I have to set the room up again. I had to bring all my

1408
03:14:20,590 --> 03:14:24,590
shit back in here until I sit down at my desk. That's...

1409
03:14:24,590 --> 03:14:31,319
This is not going to happen tonight. Tonight was really just to make sure that the stream

1410
03:14:31,319 --> 03:14:37,420
could be on for more than two or three hours. Like I got to set up my lighthouses back here again.

1411
03:14:37,420 --> 03:14:49,280
Yeah, Vive is a total commitment. And I have to be certain

1412
03:14:49,280 --> 03:14:57,280
that it's possible too. I need a tree. Because once I go in

1413
03:14:57,280 --> 03:15:01,579
that thing, I had a conversation with a talc about it earlier today.

1414
03:15:01,579 --> 03:15:05,579
It's like, oh, am I going to stream Vive today? Well, maybe the internet might not work.

1415
03:15:05,579 --> 03:15:10,010
I have to fucking take a gigantic robot outfit and

1416
03:15:10,010 --> 03:15:14,010
put lighthouses all over my room and the stream turns off in 45 minutes.

1417
03:15:14,010 --> 03:15:19,469
I'm just going to be like, well, that was fucking dumb. Can I even climb this tree?

1418
03:15:19,469 --> 03:15:30,750
Let me just make sure I can climb the trees here. How do you determine if you can climb

1419
03:15:30,750 --> 03:15:39,639
a tree? Yeah, I saw there was tons of recommendations

1420
03:15:39,639 --> 03:15:44,649
for VR. There's so many things to do.

1421
03:15:44,649 --> 03:15:48,649
It's actually kind of overwhelming how many fucking Vive games there are

1422
03:15:48,649 --> 03:16:06,329
that I haven't played. Mind Show is the number one.

1423
03:16:06,329 --> 03:16:12,219
And I'm not even certain I'm going to do that tomorrow. Or the next day,

1424
03:16:12,219 --> 03:16:27,719
depending again on how this internet works out.

1425
03:16:27,719 --> 03:16:37,979
Where are the giraffes? I gotta go to like a pool somewhere.

1426
03:16:37,979 --> 03:16:44,329
If you don't know what Mind Show is, Mind Show is a VR game.

1427
03:16:44,329 --> 03:16:48,329
It's not really a game, it's more of an experience. Where you

1428
03:16:48,329 --> 03:16:52,329
get into the VR shit

1429
03:16:52,329 --> 03:16:56,329
and you make scenes and make your own movie. TV show

1430
03:16:56,329 --> 03:17:00,760
skit thing. It's very much like you control

1431
03:17:00,760 --> 03:17:05,899
the movies in a way, the sets,

1432
03:17:05,899 --> 03:17:10,840
the set pieces. I'm really looking forward to it. Alright, here we go.

1433
03:17:10,840 --> 03:17:22,680
That's a tree I can get in. There's a

1434
03:17:22,680 --> 03:17:28,520
microphone built into the Vive too, which I didn't even know. So that's going to be

1435
03:17:28,520 --> 03:17:34,040
really interesting. Alright, stop freaking out, I'm fine.

1436
03:17:34,040 --> 03:17:38,040
No, no, no, no, don't run away. I just need to get your eye level in your face. This one didn't

1437
03:17:38,040 --> 03:17:43,049
run. This one didn't run. The Vive mic sucks.

1438
03:17:43,049 --> 03:17:48,379
Yeah, but it might be fun to use it. Because my microphone setup is really

1439
03:17:48,379 --> 03:17:52,379
not like the best in regards to standing in a room.

1440
03:17:52,379 --> 03:18:02,750
Can you tell me I can't get in this tree? I can definitely get on this tree. I have

1441
03:18:02,750 --> 03:18:23,420
to be able to. Look at this, it's perfect. Alright, what the hell was that?

1442
03:18:23,420 --> 03:18:30,159
How am I going to get this? I gotta be right in their face?

1443
03:18:30,159 --> 03:18:43,149
This is not like right in their face. He's got to get much closer. Just throw

1444
03:18:43,149 --> 03:18:52,750
the camera. God damn it, turn around. I wonder if they'll come over to the tree and eat.

1445
03:18:52,750 --> 03:19:00,750
Get the zebra picture too.

1446
03:19:00,750 --> 03:19:09,180
Yeah, I'm trying to be as prepared as possible.

1447
03:19:09,180 --> 03:19:13,739
Because I know there's a lot of things that can go wrong

1448
03:19:13,739 --> 03:19:17,739
in VR streaming. So I'm making sure to make sure

1449
03:19:17,739 --> 03:19:22,489
the room is set up completely perfect. The games I'll have

1450
03:19:22,489 --> 03:19:31,340
work. I'm just fucking happy the internet works.

1451
03:19:31,340 --> 03:19:41,340
I have to have patience now. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. No, I don't.

1452
03:19:41,340 --> 03:19:45,770
You just turn your head this way.

1453
03:19:45,770 --> 03:20:03,319
That should be alright. Turn this way. Come on, turn your head this way. Do it.

1454
03:20:03,319 --> 03:20:26,000
No, my fucking zoom. He's coming this way. Turn,

1455
03:20:26,000 --> 03:20:48,510
turn, turn your head. I think I got it. Let's take a look.

1456
03:20:48,510 --> 03:20:56,000
I didn't have time to mess with settings there. I had to go to auto.

1457
03:20:56,000 --> 03:21:01,120
Here it is. It could be that one though. That one's good too.

1458
03:21:01,120 --> 03:21:13,020
It's probably this one. Or this one.

1459
03:21:13,020 --> 03:21:18,479
I should have done vertical. Yeah, shit, you're right. I'm going to stay here.

1460
03:21:18,479 --> 03:21:28,909
He'll come back. I always use manual. Well, I got a real camera.

1461
03:21:28,909 --> 03:21:53,680
Not a video game camera. Let's try it again.

1462
03:21:53,680 --> 03:21:57,680
I do realize now this stream is just me taking photos of animals. Look at that one.

1463
03:21:57,680 --> 03:22:14,700
You get the little one and you get the big one. Opportunity here. Hold on.

1464
03:22:14,700 --> 03:22:26,799
Stay there. No, you idiot. You just ruined the whole thing.

1465
03:22:26,799 --> 03:22:34,409
This would have been so cute. Go. Move. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1466
03:22:34,409 --> 03:22:44,729
It's off. It's all fucked up. Doesn't matter.

1467
03:22:44,729 --> 03:22:51,149
I could have got his face. Please move out of the way so I can get this. I'm going to have to crop you out.

1468
03:22:51,149 --> 03:22:57,159
Nice. Nice work. Thanks a lot.

1469
03:22:57,159 --> 03:23:05,610
Do what you want. Go over there. Dickhead. Do that on purpose.

1470
03:23:05,610 --> 03:23:10,299
No, no, no. Wait. Stop. Stop. This is perfect. Go to auto. I don't care.

1471
03:23:10,299 --> 03:23:24,250
No black and white. This is the one.

1472
03:23:24,250 --> 03:23:39,149
Turn. Turn. Turn your head. Turn your head this way.

1473
03:23:39,149 --> 03:23:45,309
Oh, it's not good.

1474
03:23:45,309 --> 03:24:09,180
It was close, but not great. Maybe you'll do it.

1475
03:24:09,180 --> 03:24:18,860
One. I'm going to turn up the... hold on. Because he's going to turn his head

1476
03:24:18,860 --> 03:24:23,479
and I'm going to get it right when he turns. It's not going to be blurry.

1477
03:24:23,479 --> 03:24:27,479
Watch this. He's going to turn and I'm going to get it right when he's mid-turned. Get the camera right here.

1478
03:24:27,479 --> 03:24:31,479
Snap it when he gets out.

1479
03:24:31,479 --> 03:24:42,829
He's basically going to cross the plane here. Why is this black and white? What the fuck?

1480
03:24:42,829 --> 03:25:01,770
I didn't do that. Turn slightly.

1481
03:25:01,770 --> 03:25:08,750
You went the wrong way. God damn it. If he had turned this way.

1482
03:25:08,750 --> 03:25:14,520
Look, it's like you're riding him. I got it. I got it. I think this one's fine.

1483
03:25:14,520 --> 03:25:35,709
Let me just... I got a secret bird.

1484
03:25:35,709 --> 03:25:48,940
This is a secret bird any day. I like that one. Secret bird.

1485
03:25:48,940 --> 03:25:54,440
See how cute that would have been if I had that framed up and all three of them were there.

1486
03:25:54,440 --> 03:25:58,940
That would have been such a great picture. Thank the dumb zebra that screwed it all up.

1487
03:25:58,940 --> 03:26:05,739
Somebody just gave me $100.

1488
03:26:05,739 --> 03:26:11,260
100 bucks. Cyclops Parker, thanks for the $100.

1489
03:26:11,260 --> 03:26:18,360
10,000 bits. Shit load.

1490
03:26:18,360 --> 03:26:22,360
They say, hey Jeremy, I've been watching you for years now, but I can rarely catch the streams live.

1491
03:26:22,360 --> 03:26:26,600
To be here, just wanted to help keep you doing what you do.

1492
03:26:26,600 --> 03:26:33,079
Thank you so much, Cyclops Parker. That's fucking incredible. Thank you.

1493
03:26:33,079 --> 03:26:37,840
If you can't catch it, as long as, you know, if you want to

1494
03:26:37,840 --> 03:26:42,590
jump in when you can, and you feel like being here, that's...

1495
03:26:42,590 --> 03:26:47,530
You're not under any obligation to come to every stream, but I really appreciate it.

1496
03:26:47,530 --> 03:26:54,379
If you come here and you're happy, that's fucking awesome. Thanks for stopping in.

1497
03:26:54,379 --> 03:27:08,139
And thank you for the $100. So I got that photo.

1498
03:27:08,139 --> 03:27:12,139
It's covering the fees. No, no, that's incredibly fucking generous

1499
03:27:12,139 --> 03:27:16,139
and nice of anybody to give that much money, or even any amount of money.

1500
03:27:16,139 --> 03:27:24,270
So, thank you. Do I have another opportunity for a fucking secret bird?

1501
03:27:24,270 --> 03:27:29,149
Did you see that? I missed it. I want to get a close-up

1502
03:27:29,149 --> 03:28:05,629
of that bird. Oh, I'll get you, motherfucker. Just you wait.

1503
03:28:05,629 --> 03:28:13,770
I would have had three there. This is just so relaxing. Why don't they make another one

1504
03:28:13,770 --> 03:28:21,790
of these, somebody? Make like an incredibly detailed version of this.

1505
03:28:21,790 --> 03:28:28,909
Just go do it in real life. I can't do this.

1506
03:28:28,909 --> 03:28:34,360
A VR game where you do this. Does that exist? If it does,

1507
03:28:34,360 --> 03:28:38,360
I'm gonna play it. All right, here we go. There's another opportunity for a

1508
03:28:38,360 --> 03:28:49,440
decent one. Damn it. I'm gonna run into

1509
03:28:49,440 --> 03:28:53,440
the photos here, if I'm not careful. I got it, I got it, I got it. Let's get the zebra face.

1510
03:28:53,440 --> 03:29:08,540
And then move on. German spells too bad to do this. What the hell are you talking about?

1511
03:29:08,540 --> 03:29:14,829
I don't know if that's gonna fly here. I don't know if that's gonna work.

1512
03:29:14,829 --> 03:29:22,680
Closer? How close can I get? Don't overdo it.

1513
03:29:22,680 --> 03:29:35,799
No, no, no, no, no, no. Drop that, drop that, drop that, drop that.

1514
03:29:35,799 --> 03:29:39,979
And when I say drop it, I mean raise it. Are you gonna walk forward?

1515
03:29:39,979 --> 03:29:47,469
I'll get this on auto. Oh, great. I think that's gonna be fine.

1516
03:29:47,469 --> 03:29:58,620
That'll be worth it, I think. Let's get out of here.

1517
03:29:58,620 --> 03:30:06,190
Got the giraffe, I got his face. Let's go. Back to base camp.

1518
03:30:06,190 --> 03:30:13,690
Apparently there's first person too. I just figured that out right now. Somehow.

1519
03:30:13,690 --> 03:30:27,309
Let's see, transfer the photos in. Some good ones.

1520
03:30:27,309 --> 03:30:32,489
Alright, giraffe at eye level. I don't have a lens that's good

1521
03:30:32,489 --> 03:30:37,040
enough to do this, but it's close enough. It's this one right here, right?

1522
03:30:37,040 --> 03:30:42,649
Yeah, that's eye level. Loving Fox

1523
03:30:42,649 --> 03:30:58,909
just gave six community subs. Thank you, Loving Fox. Thank you for the

1524
03:30:58,909 --> 03:31:03,530
six. How is that target not more than great?

1525
03:31:03,530 --> 03:31:12,860
Because his head is tilted a little too much, apparently.

1526
03:31:12,860 --> 03:31:23,290
Now, here we go. Is this good enough? I don't know, like

1527
03:31:23,290 --> 03:31:42,600
that's as best as I'm gonna get with this lens. Really?

1528
03:31:42,600 --> 03:31:47,739
Okay. This one is the, get a close up of an African

1529
03:31:47,739 --> 03:31:52,110
buffalo. Try and get as close to a vicious buffalo as you can with looking for a dynamic

1530
03:31:52,110 --> 03:31:56,110
really tense shot. I gotta know where the car is.

1531
03:31:56,110 --> 03:32:05,920
The car is gonna be right behind me. And this one is already here. Wait,

1532
03:32:05,920 --> 03:32:16,799
secret bird. Bingo. Is there a better one?

1533
03:32:16,799 --> 03:32:34,459
That's pretty good. The superb starling adult.

1534
03:32:34,459 --> 03:32:47,319
Alright, let's go get killed by a buffalo. Use the brushes cover.

1535
03:32:47,319 --> 03:32:51,629
Can I just do it now? No, I gotta go to bed.

1536
03:32:51,629 --> 03:33:03,340
I love the plane sound effect when you email pictures.

1537
03:33:03,340 --> 03:33:08,780
We might have more to do though, let's see.

1538
03:33:08,780 --> 03:33:20,559
Where's the wall here? Play another game.

1539
03:33:20,559 --> 03:33:25,479
This is the plan. This is the game that I wanted to play for a little while.

1540
03:33:25,479 --> 03:33:39,389
I'm just hanging out and playing it. We are on the PlayStation 3, so even if there was

1541
03:33:39,389 --> 03:33:43,819
something else I wanted to do, I would have to kind of set up

1542
03:33:43,819 --> 03:33:49,469
something else and not capture my PlayStation 3.

1543
03:33:49,469 --> 03:33:53,469
And there's nothing really that's ready to go right this second, because remember, I didn't even know the stream was gonna happen today.

1544
03:33:53,469 --> 03:33:57,469
So I knew that I had this game, and that if I could stream I was

1545
03:33:57,469 --> 03:34:02,600
gonna try it. So this stream was not really supposed to happen.

1546
03:34:02,600 --> 03:34:06,600
But I'm so glad it did, because now I know that the internet works.

1547
03:34:06,600 --> 03:34:24,590
And I'm stuck.

1548
03:34:24,590 --> 03:34:28,590
I just want people to be aware that's why I'm just playing a

1549
03:34:28,590 --> 03:34:35,129
take photos of animals safari game.

1550
03:34:35,129 --> 03:34:39,129
There's a lot of vibe shit to do, but like I said before, I just want to make sure that I'm able to

1551
03:34:39,129 --> 03:34:48,600
stay alive for more than 5 fucking hours.

1552
03:34:48,600 --> 03:34:56,239
What happened there? Alright, tense buffalo close up of a buffalo's angry face.

1553
03:34:56,239 --> 03:35:00,239
Is it possible to roll the car? No, you can't roll the car and you can't run over any animals.

1554
03:35:00,239 --> 03:35:07,100
Sorry everybody. I don't know why I have to apologize for that.

1555
03:35:07,100 --> 03:35:14,920
That should be like, oh that's good that you can't do that. I gotta pick a beeline for the car.

1556
03:35:14,920 --> 03:35:29,450
After getting this picture. After we get this photo though, there's probably gonna be another

1557
03:35:29,450 --> 03:35:38,299
super mission. I'm glad you can't hurt the animals. That's what I was saying.

1558
03:35:38,299 --> 03:35:42,600
I wasn't saying I'm sad that I can't run them over.

1559
03:35:42,600 --> 03:35:54,719
This is a pretty good sit on the couch and have your mouth open game though.

1560
03:35:54,719 --> 03:36:08,280
It definitely is. I would play this game

1561
03:36:08,280 --> 03:36:14,059
with like a niece or a nephew and be like, oh can you, I don't see, do you see the buffaloes

1562
03:36:14,059 --> 03:36:18,750
anywhere? Right there! Oh you're right, you're right, yeah!

1563
03:36:18,750 --> 03:36:36,479
Should we go take a photo? He's a boomer uncle.

1564
03:36:36,479 --> 03:36:40,479
What's wrong with that? What's wrong with being like an uncle? That's not a problem.

1565
03:36:40,479 --> 03:37:04,909
That kinda hurt my head. Anything that's like boomer

1566
03:37:04,909 --> 03:37:09,659
to a lot of you guys apparently. How do I not be

1567
03:37:09,659 --> 03:37:14,479
like a quote boomer? What if I told you guys I eat like candy?

1568
03:37:14,479 --> 03:37:18,479
Okay, so if I ate a bunch of candy it was in the first grade, why

1569
03:37:18,479 --> 03:37:39,399
would I still be a boomer? Yes. You were born in 1985.

1570
03:37:39,399 --> 03:37:48,959
I know, but what if I wasn't? I went to the

1571
03:37:48,959 --> 03:37:53,840
dentist today. What a boomer. Teeth health is a boomer thing?

1572
03:37:53,840 --> 03:38:13,680
Where the fuck are these buffaloes? What kind of question is that?

1573
03:38:13,680 --> 03:38:24,489
Where did it go? Oh!

1574
03:38:24,489 --> 03:38:29,799
Okay, come here. Those are elephants. I found elephants.

1575
03:38:29,799 --> 03:38:33,799
They just woke the fuck up now. Hey, if you're watching and you were like kind of drifting off

1576
03:38:33,799 --> 03:38:37,799
and like hanging out and not excited about this scream because it's just kind of a chill scream.

1577
03:38:37,799 --> 03:39:00,649
Wake! Wake up! Time to get up!

1578
03:39:00,649 --> 03:39:22,479
Never mind, go back to bed. Sorry I woke you up for that.

1579
03:39:22,479 --> 03:39:26,479
That bunch of people probably did just like wake up from just like taking, they kind of drifted off.

1580
03:39:26,479 --> 03:39:30,479
It was an invisible wall to hide the elephants apparently.

1581
03:39:30,479 --> 03:39:40,079
Well, I got photos of them.

1582
03:39:40,079 --> 03:39:50,399
I thought they were buffalo at first. Well, that's like the edge of the universe right there.

1583
03:39:50,399 --> 03:40:04,719
The edge of the universe. Stop. No, no.

1584
03:40:04,719 --> 03:40:10,559
Stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay. Not fast enough. Hold on.

1585
03:40:10,559 --> 03:40:22,760
They're gonna land. Right here. Fuck. I gotta get a good

1586
03:40:22,760 --> 03:40:54,569
swampy moss photo with some red eyes.

1587
03:40:54,569 --> 03:41:03,040
Whatever. Oh, you keep coming in right when I stop doing that.

1588
03:41:03,040 --> 03:41:11,739
Whatever. I'll never get the perfect photo again.

1589
03:41:17,649 --> 03:41:25,840
Turn. Is someone coming in? I have to stay in the same spot.

1590
03:41:25,840 --> 03:41:33,600
This guy's gonna turn around and fly back overhead. Yeah, I'm fishing for shots. It sucks.

1591
03:41:33,600 --> 03:41:39,190
You have to let the wildlife come to you. You can't go to the wildlife.

1592
03:41:39,190 --> 03:41:45,459
Eventually just aim your camera out your window. Eventually a rhino will

1593
03:41:45,459 --> 03:42:00,440
walk by. You have to do it for a long time. Come on.

1594
03:42:00,440 --> 03:42:07,600
Somebody turn. We got one coming in right here, don't we? Did it turn? I don't think so.

1595
03:42:07,600 --> 03:42:18,420
No, they're all flying this way. Hold on. I'm in a bad place.

1596
03:42:18,420 --> 03:42:41,190
Bad spot. God damn it. Wait. I don't even know what that is.

1597
03:42:41,190 --> 03:42:49,829
Let me find them. Let me do the mission at hand here. Let's find the

1598
03:42:49,829 --> 03:43:00,600
buffalo. Chad has voted to adjust Jerma's height to

1599
03:43:00,600 --> 03:43:10,979
three feet. I love how that's an adjustment.

1600
03:43:10,979 --> 03:43:15,409
That's an adjustment. Alright, here we go. We need an aggressive shot. Keep the

1601
03:43:15,409 --> 03:43:20,680
engine running. Here we go. He's gonna turn around and run directly behind me.

1602
03:43:20,680 --> 03:43:35,780
An angry face. Okay. Get close enough.

1603
03:43:35,780 --> 03:43:41,940
He's gonna get close. Wait till he gets closer.

1604
03:43:41,940 --> 03:43:54,309
Okay, hold on. Not tense enough. He needs to be angry.

1605
03:43:54,309 --> 03:44:10,559
Okay, here we go. Ready? One. Holy fuck.

1606
03:44:10,559 --> 03:44:23,239
That's a great one. Get in the car. Oh, that was good.

1607
03:44:23,239 --> 03:44:33,280
Get me out of here. I gotta take a look at that one.

1608
03:44:33,280 --> 03:44:49,920
That's gotta be worth some money. This thing was about to kill me.

1609
03:44:49,920 --> 03:45:00,690
That was a great one. I said that really fucking weirdly. I wanna hear how I said that.

1610
03:45:00,690 --> 03:45:08,840
That was really strange. Okay, here we go. Ready? One.

1611
03:45:08,840 --> 03:45:16,709
Holy fuck. That's a great one. I said that weird, right?

1612
03:45:16,709 --> 03:45:27,510
Something about that was off. I don't know why.

1613
03:45:27,510 --> 03:45:39,559
Alright, let's get out of here. Australian accent.

1614
03:45:39,559 --> 03:45:48,979
Fuck. That's a great one, Mike.

1615
03:45:48,979 --> 03:45:55,700
That is a good one, though. I tell you.

1616
03:45:55,700 --> 03:46:01,409
That's my normal voice.

1617
03:46:01,409 --> 03:46:11,840
If I sound like that? Take your photo. This better get in the magazine.

1618
03:46:11,840 --> 03:46:18,959
Marvelous. Marvelous. All marvelous.

1619
03:46:18,959 --> 03:46:22,959
That's bullshit. How would I get closer?

1620
03:46:22,959 --> 03:46:29,059
Are you trying to make this photographer die? How would you get closer than I did?

1621
03:46:29,059 --> 03:46:34,440
I was seconds away from being killed. That's not close enough, apparently.

1622
03:46:34,440 --> 03:46:42,709
Congratulations! Published in the magazine Nature Power.

1623
03:46:42,709 --> 03:46:47,520
Check the bookshelf to view your own published photos.

1624
03:46:47,520 --> 03:46:51,959
Nice. Okay, what about this one? We had a picture of elephants, right?

1625
03:46:51,959 --> 03:47:05,590
Some weird fucking bird. Who cares? Just give me the money.

1626
03:47:05,590 --> 03:47:09,590
For the record, that's a better photo than the almost-dying charging buffalo.

1627
03:47:09,590 --> 03:47:29,510
What else am I missing here?

1628
03:47:29,510 --> 03:47:40,340
Did I get these already? I don't think so. Yeah, I already had a picture of them.

1629
03:47:40,340 --> 03:47:45,780
I do have the distance elephants. This is such a bad photo

1630
03:47:45,780 --> 03:47:56,040
of elephants, but you know what? I just want the data.

1631
03:47:56,040 --> 03:48:04,309
The distance is terrible, but it's okay. African elephant, African elephant.

1632
03:48:04,309 --> 03:48:10,500
Alright. Cool. Let me go look at my published work.

1633
03:48:10,500 --> 03:48:17,809
Let's see. National Geographic. Let's take a look inside. Let's find our photos.

1634
03:48:17,809 --> 03:48:29,010
Monthly Nature Power. The African buffalo

1635
03:48:29,010 --> 03:48:33,190
are grazers eating grass and leaves off trees. Those are real photos

1636
03:48:33,190 --> 03:48:38,770
and then mine's a fake one. Imagine you wouldn't get away

1637
03:48:38,770 --> 03:48:43,079
with that. This is a real magazine. Very clearly,

1638
03:48:43,079 --> 03:48:49,040
the one on the left is not real. I'm trying to pull that off.

1639
03:48:49,040 --> 03:48:56,799
It's a computer-generated image. Somebody's not going to pick up on that?

1640
03:48:56,799 --> 03:49:09,090
That's a great picture. I'm shitting on the PlayStation 3 graphics.

1641
03:49:09,090 --> 03:49:13,090
No, I'm saying that the photos on the right are real photos.

1642
03:49:13,090 --> 03:49:17,090
This could be on the PS4. This could be on

1643
03:49:17,090 --> 03:49:21,270
a GTX 2080 of max settings

1644
03:49:21,270 --> 03:49:25,270
on the Frostbite engine, and that's still not a real buffalo over there.

1645
03:49:25,270 --> 03:49:39,090
The real photos look worse. They don't look worse.

1646
03:49:39,090 --> 03:49:43,090
Hang that one on the wall, but I can't take this one down.

1647
03:49:43,090 --> 03:49:57,620
This is me and my friend. I can't do that.

1648
03:49:57,620 --> 03:50:12,079
Let's take a look. We should have news. Here we go. Big ticket item.

1649
03:50:12,079 --> 03:50:19,780
Need a shot of the herd's top trumpet.

1650
03:50:19,780 --> 03:50:30,479
I can't. This is strange for me to say this, but I can't tell.

1651
03:50:30,479 --> 03:50:35,729
Is that video playing here on the right? Claimation.

1652
03:50:35,729 --> 03:50:39,969
It feels like it's stop-motion. The background doesn't look real.

1653
03:50:39,969 --> 03:50:55,200
That's not claimation going on? Wait, no. Look at the end.

1654
03:50:55,200 --> 03:51:02,930
Watch the end. It's over-animated. That's not real.

1655
03:51:02,930 --> 03:51:06,930
All right, take the... Each African elephant herd has a boss who holds it together.

1656
03:51:06,930 --> 03:51:17,569
Could you take a photo of one? That background's not real.

1657
03:51:17,569 --> 03:51:21,569
That's not a real background. That's on a set. That's a set somewhere. Look at the clouds. Look behind them.

1658
03:51:21,569 --> 03:51:31,170
They manufactured that. I'll be right. That's fine.

1659
03:51:31,170 --> 03:51:45,430
It's like a narcissistic thing to say.

1660
03:51:45,430 --> 03:51:49,430
So how do you tell the difference between a boss and the others?

1661
03:51:49,430 --> 03:51:53,430
They battle to determine who gets the position. The winner must have a certain qualities.

1662
03:51:53,430 --> 03:51:57,920
Fierce-looking tusks, for example.

1663
03:51:57,920 --> 03:52:10,739
So big tusks. We've got to find the big boss. I can't do that.

1664
03:52:10,739 --> 03:52:18,040
Okay. Also, this is real. That looks real to me.

1665
03:52:18,040 --> 03:52:27,329
I'm working as a photographer lately trying to steal my business. Just kidding.

1666
03:52:27,329 --> 03:52:31,329
There's a bird called the cattle egret. They travel with large herbivores as a rule.

1667
03:52:31,329 --> 03:52:35,329
I got those requests for a photo for a cattle egret.

1668
03:52:35,329 --> 03:52:39,329
An African elephant together. But I'm too busy. Think you can get the shot for me?

1669
03:52:39,329 --> 03:52:46,959
Take a look at that way that elephant looks.

1670
03:52:46,959 --> 03:52:52,420
And the background and the foreground. Look at the claymation.

1671
03:52:52,420 --> 03:53:01,569
I'm fucking out of here. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1672
03:53:01,569 --> 03:53:05,569
If only they'd come a little closer. Let's continue to observe the herd.

1673
03:53:05,569 --> 03:53:09,569
The pond with the anthill will be the perfect place to watch them from.

1674
03:53:09,569 --> 03:53:18,850
I saw them already.

1675
03:53:18,850 --> 03:53:42,610
I have to save the game. I'm sorry. I'm going to spend like five minutes saving this.

1676
03:53:42,610 --> 03:53:46,610
Game sucks. Please play I spy spooky mansion again.

1677
03:53:46,610 --> 03:53:51,040
I like this. I'm not going to do this for that much longer.

1678
03:53:51,040 --> 03:53:55,040
This is the internet test stream. Don't you guys understand?

1679
03:53:55,040 --> 03:54:14,069
There it is. Bingo. I've been playing for five hours?

1680
03:54:14,069 --> 03:54:20,659
I've only been playing for like four? Three and a half?

1681
03:54:20,659 --> 03:54:27,010
Remember I spent 30 minutes creating my character. That doesn't really count as playing.

1682
03:54:27,010 --> 03:54:32,979
Play space channel five. I want to watch Ulala. I have it.

1683
03:54:32,979 --> 03:54:36,979
But I can't do that.

1684
03:54:36,979 --> 03:54:40,979
Because that would require me to take down the PS3.

1685
03:54:40,979 --> 03:54:44,979
And hook up and plug everything in and get everything set up for the Dreamcast.

1686
03:54:44,979 --> 03:54:49,409
Which the Dreamcast is in the closet right now.

1687
03:54:49,409 --> 03:54:53,409
I've got to make sure the audio works.

1688
03:54:53,409 --> 03:54:58,739
Hold on a second though. I've got to show you this.

1689
03:54:58,739 --> 03:55:11,239
This came in the mail. Something finally came in the mail.

1690
03:55:11,239 --> 03:55:21,620
Something people have been waiting for for a while.

1691
03:55:21,620 --> 03:55:27,719
Me too. I had some issues with the mail.

1692
03:55:27,719 --> 03:55:31,719
Where are they? They finally came in. I'm going to finally prove that I own this.

1693
03:55:31,719 --> 03:55:35,719
Because everybody is so annoyed at me for not proving that I own this.

1694
03:55:35,719 --> 03:55:40,469
That's right. The Seaman webcam. There it is.

1695
03:55:40,469 --> 03:55:47,200
The Seaman microphone. I got it.

1696
03:55:47,200 --> 03:55:54,260
So we can actually play that game. What's wrong with it? I look weird.

1697
03:55:54,260 --> 03:56:08,280
Get that off. Yeah it actually came.

1698
03:56:08,280 --> 03:56:22,040
We demand Pikachu socks. I don't even know if that is.

1699
03:56:22,040 --> 03:56:26,340
I look like I've made it a clay. Do I? Am I claymation?

1700
03:56:26,340 --> 03:56:55,190
I do look like I made it a clay. Am I real?

1701
03:56:55,190 --> 03:57:02,760
I made it a clay today. I don't know why. I got a greasy face.

1702
03:57:02,760 --> 03:57:12,120
That's just a clay drive. Relax. What the fuck was I doing?

1703
03:57:12,120 --> 03:57:16,680
Now I'm going to be so self-conscious. Forever. Forever.

1704
03:57:16,680 --> 03:57:26,479
Look what you've done to me. Look what you've done.

1705
03:57:26,479 --> 03:57:30,479
You're in a room. It's like a dark room.

1706
03:57:30,479 --> 03:57:35,239
And all of a sudden TVs turn on. Two TVs back to back.

1707
03:57:35,239 --> 03:57:41,399
You had one second. Which one of these is clay?

1708
03:57:41,399 --> 03:57:48,950
I'm going to do the same motions as the elephant.

1709
03:57:48,950 --> 03:58:19,090
I'll do it for you. Ready? Which one of those is clay?

1710
03:58:19,090 --> 03:58:23,520
Stand up and do it. I'm not fucking standing up and doing that.

1711
03:58:23,520 --> 03:58:33,959
Not a chance. That's just old. Why are you putting the fucking birthing

1712
03:58:33,959 --> 03:58:48,950
scene from Outlast 2? Why would you put that here? I don't know why that's there.

1713
03:58:48,950 --> 03:58:52,950
What was that shit-eating grin? I made it a fucking clay. I gotta get out of here.

1714
03:58:52,950 --> 03:59:13,110
I'm not on camera ever again. Can I get a haircut? I can't.

1715
03:59:13,110 --> 03:59:18,049
I can't get a haircut. Why would I get a haircut?

1716
03:59:18,049 --> 03:59:22,049
It's a shitload of blood vessels. Each individual hair is a blood vessel.

1717
03:59:22,049 --> 04:00:05,010
I don't want to be caught up in bleed and shit.

1718
04:00:05,010 --> 04:00:10,530
German alternative facts are fucking out of hand.

1719
04:00:10,530 --> 04:00:20,819
Alright, what's the deal here? I need to get an elephant.

1720
04:00:20,819 --> 04:00:35,860
I gotta get the boss of the elephant. Does your hair have nerve endings? No.

1721
04:00:35,860 --> 04:00:40,549
They just bleed and it's weird. When you snip the ends of one hair

1722
04:00:40,549 --> 04:00:46,200
of blood, two or three droplets come out of each strand.

1723
04:00:46,200 --> 04:00:50,200
I hate going to the barber. I hate going to the dentist. I hate going to the doctor.

1724
04:00:50,200 --> 04:01:10,479
Is it really going to stop me? Can I just go to the wetlands please?

1725
04:01:10,479 --> 04:01:33,540
Don't you guys know the golden rule of this stream?

1726
04:01:33,540 --> 04:01:40,719
How are you guys losing the golden rule of this stream? Treat others

1727
04:01:40,719 --> 04:01:44,719
the way that you would like to be 95% of everything I say is

1728
04:01:44,719 --> 04:02:17,110
a lie. Alright, elephant.

1729
04:02:17,110 --> 04:02:21,110
If 90 to 95% of everything you say is bullshit

1730
04:02:21,110 --> 04:02:25,110
and just made up, then what about all the times when you say

1731
04:02:25,110 --> 04:02:29,110
things that are really nice and you're not messing around? So everything you say is

1732
04:02:29,110 --> 04:02:33,110
a lie? Well think of how many dumb fucking things I say.

1733
04:02:33,110 --> 04:02:37,110
I'd probably say a hundred stupid things being broadcasted.

1734
04:02:37,110 --> 04:02:41,110
Five of those things would definitely be legit.

1735
04:02:41,110 --> 04:03:01,520
Where are the elephants? They're all on the edge.

1736
04:03:01,520 --> 04:03:05,889
How am I going to get to snap the elephant boss when I can't even

1737
04:03:05,889 --> 04:03:12,629
go over to see them? They're all down there. I can't go over

1738
04:03:12,629 --> 04:03:21,889
there. How do we know that wasn't a lie? I don't know.

1739
04:03:21,889 --> 04:03:28,680
I heard of African elephants coming this way. I heard it's on the move.

1740
04:03:28,680 --> 04:03:39,040
Alright, they're looking for the one with the big tusks.

1741
04:03:39,040 --> 04:03:45,190
The king of the elephants, right?

1742
04:03:45,190 --> 04:03:51,200
Which one of these is the boss? It says you can tell because they start

1743
04:03:51,200 --> 04:04:00,549
fighting and they have big tusks. One of the little ones is

1744
04:04:00,549 --> 04:04:06,629
probably the boss. Well, this is not a Looney Tunes cartoon.

1745
04:04:06,629 --> 04:04:24,870
So I'm going to say the answer to that is probably no. Is that the leader?

1746
04:04:24,870 --> 04:04:34,040
That's the one that's leading everybody here. That could be the one.

1747
04:04:34,040 --> 04:04:47,920
What about boss baby? No. That's like a meme

1748
04:04:47,920 --> 04:04:52,610
answer. You know, boss baby is currently like a funny

1749
04:04:52,610 --> 04:04:57,879
meme right now, right? That's not a bad shot of all the elephants.

1750
04:04:57,879 --> 04:05:06,520
This one has to be the leader. They're all following the leader. I'm not going to get run

1751
04:05:06,520 --> 04:05:17,670
over, right? Yeah, this has to be the leader. Why would they all be following this

1752
04:05:17,670 --> 04:05:33,860
one elephant here? Unless I'm missing something. This one has like a broken

1753
04:05:33,860 --> 04:05:41,090
tusk. This one's been in a bunch of fights. I'm going to say it's probably this one.

1754
04:05:41,090 --> 04:05:45,090
The one in the back? The one in the back has huge tusks. Wait, wait, wait.

1755
04:05:45,090 --> 04:05:50,159
It actually might be the one all the way in back. See how big the tusks are on that one?

1756
04:05:50,159 --> 04:05:58,500
See look, ready? This one has a kind of broken tusk. That one has gigantic

1757
04:05:58,500 --> 04:06:02,930
teeth. Much bigger than anybody else. It's definitely that one back there.

1758
04:06:02,930 --> 04:06:33,000
I've got to get closer. Am I going to be safe here? It's a bad photo.

1759
04:06:33,000 --> 04:06:49,829
It's not you. I need the other one. Oh, fuck. I can't move. I can't move.

1760
04:06:49,829 --> 04:06:54,450
I can't move. Don't move. Don't move. Oh, god. Don't move. Oh, fuck.

1761
04:06:54,450 --> 04:07:01,569
Okay. Got to run. Where's the jeep? It's all the way back there. Oh, fuck.

1762
04:07:01,569 --> 04:07:07,969
Oh, no. I'm going to die. I'm good. Alright, where's the leader? I'm going to wrap

1763
04:07:07,969 --> 04:07:18,469
around here. There's the leader right there. God, perfect opportunity to get

1764
04:07:18,469 --> 04:07:31,989
in front. Right here. Oh, come here you majestic bastard.

1765
04:07:31,989 --> 04:07:36,840
Got it. I can get a better one than that though. It's going to look right in the camera.

1766
04:07:36,840 --> 04:07:45,219
Just get it. That's good. That's good. That looks good. Perfect.

1767
04:07:45,219 --> 04:08:00,260
T-pose to assert dominance. No, don't look at me.

1768
04:08:00,260 --> 04:08:07,000
Las Vegas photographer dies attempting to get pictures of elephant boss baby.

1769
04:08:07,000 --> 04:08:20,370
Okay.

1770
04:08:20,370 --> 04:08:24,549
I need the elephant birds too. Yeah, but where are they? They're not going anywhere.

1771
04:08:24,549 --> 04:08:31,090
I need to get back in the car because look at how far away this is.

1772
04:08:31,090 --> 04:08:36,159
How much longer am I going to be playing? I don't know. Maybe like another hour or so.

1773
04:08:36,159 --> 04:08:42,129
Hour or two. I don't know. I'm still enjoying my time. We're just kind of

1774
04:08:42,129 --> 04:08:46,129
hanging out talking about 95% of everything I say is lies on one of those screens.

1775
04:08:46,129 --> 04:08:59,959
Eric literally does not do anything. No, Eric does not do

1776
04:08:59,959 --> 04:09:03,959
anything. You're right. But here they go. They're going to like the swamp thing here.

1777
04:09:03,959 --> 04:09:08,709
Birds. What? It wants a symbiotic relationship thing.

1778
04:09:08,709 --> 04:09:15,700
What does it want me to do? African elephant's avian sidekick

1779
04:09:15,700 --> 04:09:19,940
shows cattle egret, shows African elephant.

1780
04:09:19,940 --> 04:09:25,059
So they have to just hang out together. Are these egrets?

1781
04:09:25,059 --> 04:09:30,959
Are those egrets? That's an egret right here, right?

1782
04:09:30,959 --> 04:09:44,129
Is it? Get in the tree. Right?

1783
04:09:44,129 --> 04:09:48,129
Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, car, car, car. Get in the tree. I'll get it.

1784
04:09:48,129 --> 04:09:57,030
I'm going to get in the tree. I'm going to cross. There's going to be a bunch of egrets.

1785
04:09:57,030 --> 04:10:27,239
Get fucking up there. Why can't I go up to this?

1786
04:10:27,239 --> 04:10:36,709
Eric is not dumb. Eric's pretty dumb. Alright, the question is I need

1787
04:10:36,709 --> 04:11:08,709
them to walk by. I need an egret. There's no egrets.

1788
04:11:08,709 --> 04:11:30,979
Didn't say that they hang out together here. Where are they going? Oh, this is bullshit.

1789
04:11:30,979 --> 04:11:40,129
Should I pull back? Does that count? Is that an egret right there?

1790
04:11:40,129 --> 04:11:44,129
It might be. Alright, there's like a weird bug in the background.

1791
04:11:44,129 --> 04:11:54,709
There's a smudge on the camera lens, but I think it was an egret. Is that an egret?

1792
04:11:54,709 --> 04:12:14,719
Does that count? I don't know if that counts.

1793
04:12:14,719 --> 04:12:27,649
Alright, well, hopefully that was one of them. Let's see where else they go.

1794
04:12:27,649 --> 04:12:31,649
Six FPS. Claymation Elephants. No, I got it. I got what I needed.

1795
04:12:31,649 --> 04:12:42,229
Yeah, let's get the hell out of here. You guys remember when he tried to play

1796
04:12:42,229 --> 04:13:04,239
Mountain Blade? I do. That was the Herd's leader, yeah. I got him.

1797
04:13:04,239 --> 04:13:10,819
It is this one, but which one's better?

1798
04:13:10,819 --> 04:13:17,479
Probably that one. This one's a little more clear, but this one

1799
04:13:17,479 --> 04:13:28,930
is a better action shot. I'm going to go with this one.

1800
04:13:28,930 --> 04:13:37,299
What do we get? That's alright. I got a B.

1801
04:13:37,299 --> 04:13:46,959
Then the... I don't know if I even have

1802
04:13:46,959 --> 04:13:50,959
because this is correct. This is such a half-ass. This is so half-ass.

1803
04:13:50,959 --> 04:13:56,100
This is the equivalent of you figuring out that you had homework

1804
04:13:56,100 --> 04:14:00,100
in homeroom, and you filled in random answers

1805
04:14:00,100 --> 04:14:15,459
on your math sheet. At least you did it. It's going to have to be

1806
04:14:15,459 --> 04:14:22,520
this first one. Is that even the right bird? I don't even know if that's the right one.

1807
04:14:22,520 --> 04:14:39,120
Whatever. At least I turned it in.

1808
04:14:39,120 --> 04:14:48,149
I turned in the homework. I still need this one. I need new stuff to unlock.

1809
04:14:48,149 --> 04:15:01,120
I got the tent. Give me a new camera.

1810
04:15:01,120 --> 04:15:05,750
You have a 150-word essay due tomorrow. 150-word essay?

1811
04:15:05,750 --> 04:15:25,829
Isn't that... That's like two paragraphs.

1812
04:15:25,829 --> 04:15:29,829
Isn't that a tweet? 150...

1813
04:15:29,829 --> 04:15:38,870
140 characters. Oh, that's an easy essay

1814
04:15:38,870 --> 04:15:47,459
meme in 2019. Oh. Every copypasta

1815
04:15:47,459 --> 04:15:52,579
always works. I don't pay attention

1816
04:15:52,579 --> 04:15:57,520
to this shit. I'm not going to like fucking Copypasta

1817
04:15:57,520 --> 04:16:01,520
Wiki and looking up what's the latest copypasta that came out like two months ago.

1818
04:16:01,520 --> 04:16:09,459
I barely go see movies that come out. Here we go.

1819
04:16:09,459 --> 04:16:14,209
Hello Francine. How you doing? I've been writing a picture book about an elephant mother and child.

1820
04:16:14,209 --> 04:16:18,209
You're on an expedition or something in Africa, right? Perfect timing. Do me a favor.

1821
04:16:18,209 --> 04:16:22,209
Snap me a photo of a baby African elephant. Give me a really cute

1822
04:16:22,209 --> 04:16:26,209
little tyke, one whose tusks haven't grown in yet.

1823
04:16:26,209 --> 04:16:32,690
This is difficult apparently. Do I have to get it falling down?

1824
04:16:32,690 --> 04:16:36,690
This is apparently very difficult. Baby African elephant.

1825
04:16:36,690 --> 04:16:47,170
Little tusks. No tusks. Okay.

1826
04:16:47,170 --> 04:16:55,430
A little tyke. Let's go. I'm going to get fucking killed

1827
04:16:55,430 --> 04:17:01,000
if I go near an elephant's child.

1828
04:17:01,000 --> 04:17:06,180
Well, we'll do just fine.

1829
04:17:06,180 --> 04:17:11,959
Still need to do that one. Alright. Let's get it. We need to photograph an elephant calf.

1830
04:17:11,959 --> 04:17:15,959
You saw an elephant herd in the corongo flats. If you climb

1831
04:17:15,959 --> 04:17:19,959
a tree they won't see you and you can catch them their most natural behavior.

1832
04:17:19,959 --> 04:17:28,790
Go get it. 200 word essay. What's the

1833
04:17:28,790 --> 04:17:32,790
standard for a college essay? Thousand words?

1834
04:17:32,790 --> 04:17:43,940
Two thousand words? I remember like somewhere around a thousand was pretty

1835
04:17:43,940 --> 04:17:55,719
standard. Ten pages. A hundred and fifty. A hundred and fifty words is

1836
04:17:55,719 --> 04:18:02,120
like a chicken cutlet recipe.

1837
04:18:02,120 --> 04:18:11,969
Alright. Baby elephant time. Let's go. I hate this thing.

1838
04:18:11,969 --> 04:18:18,389
A hundred and fifty words is a paragraph, but that's what I mean. Chicken cutlet?

1839
04:18:18,389 --> 04:18:23,639
You want a fucking chicken cutlet? Yeah, we make the best fucking chicken cutlet chip.

1840
04:18:23,639 --> 04:18:30,950
I love. Chicken cutlet is one of my favorite things in the world.

1841
04:18:30,950 --> 04:18:50,579
I'm doing a funny voice. Funny voice.

1842
04:18:50,579 --> 04:18:54,579
I'm not allowed to like change the pitch of my voice to just make like a point about a chicken cutlet.

1843
04:18:54,579 --> 04:19:13,139
He did the funny. If I was to go on Shark Tank,

1844
04:19:13,139 --> 04:19:27,750
who do you guys think would be the shark that would give me the deal?

1845
04:19:27,750 --> 04:19:33,319
None of them. Mark Cuban? Maybe it would be Mr. Wonderful.

1846
04:19:33,319 --> 04:19:39,280
There's a reason why I'm Mr. Wonderful. Fuck his deals. They're always terrible.

1847
04:19:39,280 --> 04:19:55,409
That guy, every time that guy just gives student loans.

1848
04:19:55,409 --> 04:20:16,200
I'm going to work with Laurie. Here we go. We're going to get a baby, right?

1849
04:20:16,200 --> 04:20:20,200
It's a boomer show? That is not a boomer show. That is like a

1850
04:20:20,200 --> 04:20:24,200
general audience. Leave it on the background and who gives a shit show?

1851
04:20:24,200 --> 04:20:33,299
Your baby, without tusks. This baby has tusks.

1852
04:20:33,299 --> 04:20:41,680
Boomer show. God. No, you know what a

1853
04:20:41,680 --> 04:20:45,680
boomer show is? This is how you guys are so wrong.

1854
04:20:45,680 --> 04:20:51,010
It's so wrong for you to say that. The Wheel of Fortune

1855
04:20:51,010 --> 04:20:58,200
is a boomer show. Jeopardy is a boomer show. All the game shows.

1856
04:20:58,200 --> 04:21:09,969
What do you mean no, it's not? Guys, I don't think there's ever been a

1857
04:21:09,969 --> 04:21:13,969
contestant on Wheel of Fortune that was under the age of 45.

1858
04:21:13,969 --> 04:21:30,420
I need another baby. Family Feud is not a boomer show. I didn't say

1859
04:21:30,420 --> 04:21:34,420
Family Feud. Oh, by the way, I bought Family Feud for Playstation 2.

1860
04:21:34,420 --> 04:21:41,920
I don't know why. I just, I had to get it. No, we have another version of Family Feud to play.

1861
04:21:41,920 --> 04:21:47,059
I don't know who the host is on this one. Oh, fuck, that's

1862
04:21:47,059 --> 04:21:55,079
a chase. Is it going to be a T-Rex chase?

1863
04:21:55,079 --> 04:22:02,639
Uh oh, I'm aggroing all of the elephants right now.

1864
04:22:02,639 --> 04:22:12,069
So that's obviously, there's no baby there that has small tusks.

1865
04:22:12,069 --> 04:22:33,319
Dumb request, that is. The other one who took it. But that was my only

1866
04:22:33,319 --> 04:22:37,319
look, I just take the missions. I take the emails. And I determine

1867
04:22:37,319 --> 04:22:42,389
alright, I can do that. I can take a picture of a baby elephant. But has to have no

1868
04:22:42,389 --> 04:22:52,450
tusks. Oh, hey, chat, hazy, did he do the run over the animals

1869
04:22:52,450 --> 04:22:58,100
joke? No, I have not. How long have I been playing for?

1870
04:22:58,100 --> 04:23:02,100
Like four and a half hours and I haven't tried that?

1871
04:23:02,100 --> 04:23:06,100
Oh, yellow owl! Here it comes!

1872
04:23:06,100 --> 04:23:11,159
Oh, what the, oh fuck. What? No, get back in.

1873
04:23:11,159 --> 04:23:25,680
Of course I tried that. That was the first thing I did.

1874
04:23:25,680 --> 04:23:29,920
Repeat what you just said. I'll try. He's like, uh oh.

1875
04:23:29,920 --> 04:23:38,760
Yellow owl! Something like that, right?

1876
04:23:38,760 --> 04:24:02,239
Are those the only elephants that are going to spawn? I don't know why

1877
04:24:02,239 --> 04:24:06,239
I'm just thinking about this. I don't know why I thought this was funny.

1878
04:24:06,239 --> 04:24:14,639
It's like, bad. For some reason I was hoping a low branch was

1879
04:24:14,639 --> 04:24:18,639
going to hang and hit this guy in the face. It's not that funny.

1880
04:24:18,639 --> 04:24:25,959
No, you know, it might have been. It might have been.

1881
04:24:25,959 --> 04:24:37,920
Alright, get out of the fucking car!

1882
04:24:37,920 --> 04:24:54,930
Baby. 12 o'clock. This baby doesn't...

1883
04:24:54,930 --> 04:24:59,239
You're going to have to deal with the picture I give you because if there's no spawned

1884
04:24:59,239 --> 04:25:03,239
elephants that are babies with no tusks then I'm not going to be able to get a picture of it.

1885
04:25:03,239 --> 04:25:09,969
I literally cannot stand the presence of Eric.

1886
04:25:09,969 --> 04:25:13,969
And all First Person does is make him more prevalent in the shot.

1887
04:25:13,969 --> 04:25:18,659
Hold on, there's a lot of babies here. Looks like he's driving the car.

1888
04:25:18,659 --> 04:25:24,120
We've stadium seating for some reason. Why? Pull up to the drive-through.

1889
04:25:24,120 --> 04:25:28,120
Not the drive-through, the drive-in. Yeah, when you pull up to the drive-through he's got a better angle to speak.

1890
04:25:28,120 --> 04:25:38,549
Right there. Baby with big tusks.

1891
04:25:38,549 --> 04:25:54,879
The one right there has big tusks too. You're just going to get a picture of a baby elephant

1892
04:25:54,879 --> 04:25:58,879
and that's pretty much what you're going to get. Sorry.

1893
04:25:58,879 --> 04:26:02,879
They asked for no tusks? I know, but there are no tusks. They all have tusks.

1894
04:26:02,879 --> 04:26:12,159
Just fucking Photoshop them out. Is it really going to be that

1895
04:26:12,159 --> 04:26:16,159
hard for you just to take the paint tool and grab on

1896
04:26:16,159 --> 04:26:20,159
a like color, the eyedropper thing,

1897
04:26:20,159 --> 04:26:36,610
and trace over the tusks? I don't give a shit.

1898
04:26:36,610 --> 04:26:52,549
That's perfect. I'm out. Just make a clay elephant and photograph

1899
04:26:52,549 --> 04:26:56,549
that. What was the side mission? Do we have one?

1900
04:26:56,549 --> 04:27:00,920
This weird one showed a male impala and two

1901
04:27:00,920 --> 04:27:09,120
or more females. Let's get it.

1902
04:27:09,120 --> 04:27:15,989
This game is stupid. No it's not. This game is not stupid.

1903
04:27:15,989 --> 04:27:27,059
That's pretty stupid. But as a whole the game is not stupid.

1904
04:27:27,059 --> 04:27:33,329
What does this game have for a rating?

1905
04:27:33,329 --> 04:27:37,329
The title of the game is Africa with a K.

1906
04:27:37,329 --> 04:27:42,129
Look it up for me. What does it have on

1907
04:27:42,129 --> 04:27:57,829
internet game news? Whatever, IGN.

1908
04:27:57,829 --> 04:28:03,409
Three and a half out of ten on IGN.

1909
04:28:03,409 --> 04:28:07,409
I need three females. There's a male right there.

1910
04:28:07,409 --> 04:28:17,280
One, two. No, I see one this way though.

1911
04:28:17,280 --> 04:28:23,829
It said on the thing only desperate streamers would play this.

1912
04:28:23,829 --> 04:28:28,069
That would be kind of funny if I had an opportunity to take a picture when it was

1913
04:28:28,069 --> 04:28:34,680
sprinting by and I didn't get it.

1914
04:28:34,680 --> 04:28:45,319
I see a bunch of females. Now what I was going to tell you is

1915
04:28:45,319 --> 04:28:55,409
fuck, I'm going to have to wait over here.

1916
04:28:55,409 --> 04:28:59,409
This is not desperate boomer. Why did I even add boomer?

1917
04:28:59,409 --> 04:29:03,719
I didn't even need to do that. Desperate streamer? No, no, no.

1918
04:29:03,719 --> 04:29:07,719
Does it say anywhere there about testing your internet? This is a test the internet game.

1919
04:29:07,719 --> 04:29:11,719
If your internet works, then you can play it and stream it for a little while.

1920
04:29:11,719 --> 04:29:15,719
Just to make sure the internet works so when you do the real stream tomorrow

1921
04:29:15,719 --> 04:29:19,959
that you'll know the internet's going to stay on. Does it say that anywhere?

1922
04:29:19,959 --> 04:29:28,920
Alright, what do we got? There's a male right there.

1923
04:29:28,920 --> 04:29:36,530
I think this game's fun. Okay, got it. Right here. Come on.

1924
04:29:36,530 --> 04:29:52,450
That male's right there. And at least three females.

1925
04:29:52,450 --> 04:29:59,190
This is like Pokemon Snap without the fun of Pokemon. Oh, I gotta get that a shot of the male.

1926
04:29:59,190 --> 04:30:15,700
That's not good. That's not good.

1927
04:30:15,700 --> 04:30:22,559
I gotta get closer. This is the right shot though. Keep him right in the middle.

1928
04:30:22,559 --> 04:30:36,319
Right there. Come on, get it. Are they wagging their tails? Head up.

1929
04:30:36,319 --> 04:30:49,000
I got it. I got it. You've walked forward to zoom back out. Yeah, because of

1930
04:30:49,000 --> 04:31:04,610
depth. Wait, we have another opportunity here for elephant.

1931
04:31:04,610 --> 04:31:13,639
Baby elephant right here? Maybe not, that's not a baby elephant.

1932
04:31:13,639 --> 04:31:37,270
It's the same one I already took a picture of before. They don't seem to really want to protect this baby.

1933
04:31:37,270 --> 04:31:44,260
I can get a great shot. The baby's not even going to move.

1934
04:31:44,260 --> 04:32:00,180
Alright, fine. No. Come here. That was close. I can get it again.

1935
04:32:00,180 --> 04:32:17,569
Right when it crosses the plane. This thing can probably kill me.

1936
04:32:17,569 --> 04:32:22,959
No, I can just leapfrog it. I have a thousand percent confidence that I could leapfrog

1937
04:32:22,959 --> 04:32:27,590
that elephant if it charged at me. Just jump as high as you can. Push down

1938
04:32:27,590 --> 04:32:38,479
four arms hard as you can up over the elephant. Alright, I got the fucking photo.

1939
04:32:38,479 --> 04:32:52,180
Let's go. I don't think anyone can do that. I don't think they could.

1940
04:32:52,180 --> 04:32:58,319
The jackass guys used to do that all the time.

1941
04:32:58,319 --> 04:33:04,919
They would like jump over shit. Alright.

1942
04:33:04,919 --> 04:33:17,970
I'm pretty sure Stevo has done what I just said in a jackass episode.

1943
04:33:17,970 --> 04:33:26,360
Let's get a good one. Baby elephant. I mean, that's cute.

1944
04:33:26,360 --> 04:33:30,360
I don't know if it's a good perfect frame, but it's pretty good.

1945
04:33:30,360 --> 04:33:43,540
I said get a cute one.

1946
04:33:43,540 --> 04:33:51,220
It's life.

1947
04:33:51,220 --> 04:33:58,209
Oh, get a cute one. That's so bad.

1948
04:33:58,209 --> 04:34:02,209
That's so bad. Oh yeah, go up in a tree.

1949
04:34:02,209 --> 04:34:15,990
Did you see this one yet? I mean, come on.

1950
04:34:15,990 --> 04:34:20,479
He even got the smoke on his legs. Just disturbing.

1951
04:34:20,479 --> 04:34:24,479
Disturbing nature. Not even remotely close to what they asked for.

1952
04:34:24,479 --> 04:34:28,919
Alright. That's good.

1953
04:34:28,919 --> 04:34:38,450
Alright, there you go in the picture book.

1954
04:34:38,450 --> 04:35:01,509
That's not an elephant calf. Okay, so that was not a...

1955
04:35:01,509 --> 04:35:05,509
That is absolutely an elephant calf. Absolutely.

1956
04:35:05,509 --> 04:35:24,439
There's no way that's not a baby. What? That doesn't make any sense.

1957
04:35:24,439 --> 04:35:32,290
Which is the good one here. Probably this one.

1958
04:35:32,290 --> 04:35:43,939
Sorry, I'll take the money. No tusks to send in the email.

1959
04:35:43,939 --> 04:35:51,750
I thought that was a criteria for...

1960
04:35:51,750 --> 04:35:59,380
That's fucking running away. That is so bad.

1961
04:35:59,380 --> 04:36:16,799
We already did this one. We already did that one. Keep that.

1962
04:36:16,799 --> 04:36:22,479
No, no, no. Keep this one. Keep that one. Keep that one.

1963
04:36:22,479 --> 04:36:26,479
Keep this one. Keep the terriers. Yep, two terriers.

1964
04:36:26,479 --> 04:36:34,880
Keep that one. Okay, delete. Okay, let's go to camera.

1965
04:36:34,880 --> 04:36:42,520
Anything new with the camera? Same lens.

1966
04:36:42,520 --> 04:36:47,330
I don't have any lenses or anything. I can't really buy one.

1967
04:36:47,330 --> 04:36:51,330
I gotta get this calf apparently somehow. I don't know what I'm missing here.

1968
04:36:51,330 --> 04:36:57,619
I'm getting the photo storage.

1969
04:36:57,619 --> 04:37:01,919
Because we need to buy it all so the game knows that I bought everything.

1970
04:37:01,919 --> 04:37:12,630
Play Apex.

1971
04:37:12,630 --> 04:37:21,080
I don't play those kind of games. Any new emails? No.

1972
04:37:21,080 --> 04:37:28,200
I need to still get this stupid thing.

1973
04:37:28,200 --> 04:37:32,200
Let me look at this camera.

1974
04:37:32,200 --> 04:37:36,200
I've never snapped a photo of a baby African elephant. Give me a really cute one.

1975
04:37:36,200 --> 04:37:40,200
One whose tusks haven't grown in yet. That's why this one's at four cameras

1976
04:37:40,200 --> 04:37:44,200
out of five. And it's 40 grand.

1977
04:37:44,200 --> 04:37:54,000
You gotta get the right spawn. Alright, I'm gonna pee my pants.

1978
04:37:54,000 --> 04:37:58,000
I'll be right back in like 30 minutes. I'm just kidding. Don't leave.

1979
04:37:58,000 --> 04:41:47,590
You can if you want to. But I'll be back in like two minutes. Gotta pee.

1980
04:41:47,590 --> 04:41:51,590
Holy shit, they made candied bacon downstairs. I gotta get out of here.

1981
04:41:51,590 --> 04:41:56,840
That was delicious.

1982
04:41:56,840 --> 04:42:03,490
Brown sugar, maple, bacon. It's unbelievable.

1983
04:42:03,490 --> 04:42:16,549
Alright, what were we doing? Baby elephant thing again, right?

1984
04:42:16,549 --> 04:42:32,290
Let's try it again. End of the stream, bacon? Not yet.

1985
04:42:32,290 --> 04:42:40,799
Not yet. We're good. I'm gonna keep going because I don't know what the status

1986
04:42:40,799 --> 04:42:45,750
is gonna be tomorrow. You know what I mean? It's easy to be like, oh, you know what? It's been like five hours.

1987
04:42:45,750 --> 04:42:52,419
Okay. No, I'm serious. No, no, no. This might be the

1988
04:42:52,419 --> 04:42:57,040
green day of the week. I have no idea. So I'm just gonna keep going.

1989
04:42:57,040 --> 04:43:14,069
I'm having fun. Green day of the week? Yeah. I do it every time.

1990
04:43:14,069 --> 04:43:20,680
It's happened every single time. Do you want to just cut them down?

1991
04:43:20,680 --> 04:43:34,389
No, no, no, that's bad. They don't leave nature alone. Alright, we'll just play a vibe game.

1992
04:43:34,389 --> 04:43:38,389
That's next up. That is the next thing that I want to do.

1993
04:43:38,389 --> 04:43:43,650
That's the real... I'm going in.

1994
04:43:43,650 --> 04:43:54,080
A lot of VR shit to do. What's the point of Eric?

1995
04:43:54,080 --> 04:43:58,080
I think what the developers were looking for was somebody to take up

1996
04:43:58,080 --> 04:44:06,040
screen real estate, and that's it. Cause I guess

1997
04:44:06,040 --> 04:44:10,040
in that tent, in that camp, if it's just empty, that doesn't feel

1998
04:44:10,040 --> 04:44:14,340
realistic. He's just like a researcher. They just put him there.

1999
04:44:14,340 --> 04:44:22,229
He just takes up real estate. So what was this? A 3.5 out of

2000
04:44:22,229 --> 04:44:29,860
10? I don't agree with that. I would put this... I would give it at least a 5.

2001
04:44:29,860 --> 04:44:41,189
Alright, baby elephants, let's go. It's a 68 on

2002
04:44:41,189 --> 04:44:46,709
Metacritic. That's probably the exact score I would give it.

2003
04:44:46,709 --> 04:44:55,479
Is it 68? Maybe. I'm willing to put this up to a 7-0

2004
04:44:55,479 --> 04:44:59,650
if, and only if, this is a very, very important detail.

2005
04:44:59,650 --> 04:45:05,220
If the next boss fight is cool.

2006
04:45:05,220 --> 04:45:09,220
The cheetah was interesting, but whatever this area's boss, in quotes,

2007
04:45:09,220 --> 04:45:13,520
is, if it's cool and fun, I might knock it up

2008
04:45:13,520 --> 04:45:28,880
to a 7-0. I'm going to search for elephants. What are the downsides?

2009
04:45:28,880 --> 04:45:32,880
Driving into any form of bush or

2010
04:45:32,880 --> 04:45:37,759
grass stops the car. And

2011
04:45:37,759 --> 04:45:43,729
it's a vast, open, sandbox experience. It just feels empty.

2012
04:45:43,729 --> 04:46:06,770
No babies, though. Are you playing

2013
04:46:06,770 --> 04:46:12,040
this game still? Yeah. I actually, this is fun.

2014
04:46:12,040 --> 04:46:16,040
It might not be a good game, but it's fun, and

2015
04:46:16,040 --> 04:46:20,849
it's rare. So, come on, that gives it a few points.

2016
04:46:20,849 --> 04:46:26,159
The fact that it's rare, and

2017
04:46:26,159 --> 04:46:30,159
your good friend Jeremy spent $50

2018
04:46:30,159 --> 04:46:34,529
on this game. So I'm going to get a $50 experience.

2019
04:46:34,529 --> 04:46:47,270
How am I supposed to find this shit? That baby

2020
04:46:47,270 --> 04:47:00,279
has tusks. Use a PlayStation 3

2021
04:47:00,279 --> 04:47:05,159
emulator. Alright, as somebody that's tried to do

2022
04:47:05,159 --> 04:47:09,159
emulators for last generation,

2023
04:47:09,159 --> 04:47:15,810
is not there yet. There are a handful of games that really, truly

2024
04:47:15,810 --> 04:47:34,069
work as intended on, like, a PS3 emulator. Have you seen any

2025
04:47:34,069 --> 04:47:40,680
elephants? And something tells me, and this might just be a hunch

2026
04:47:40,680 --> 04:47:45,540
here, that the Safari

2027
04:47:45,540 --> 04:47:49,540
Photography, the Safari Photograph video game, Africa,

2028
04:47:49,540 --> 04:47:53,540
is not high on the list to get it to work well with an emulator.

2029
04:47:53,540 --> 04:48:00,020
I would probably say that's an accurate statement.

2030
04:48:00,020 --> 04:48:14,290
Where are the elephants? God damn it. Alright, huge pack of elephants.

2031
04:48:14,290 --> 04:48:21,080
Where are the babies? Why do I have to be

2032
04:48:21,080 --> 04:48:28,180
on the rare quest? You have tusks. Yes, I know

2033
04:48:28,180 --> 04:48:35,799
what those are. I know where they are. Leave me alone. You also have

2034
04:48:35,799 --> 04:48:43,090
tusks. Am I supposed to climb a tree for this one? Yeah, but

2035
04:48:43,090 --> 04:48:47,840
am I just going to climb a tree and wait for elephants to walk by the tree?

2036
04:48:47,840 --> 04:49:04,419
How long that's going to take? Get out of the way. Come on.

2037
04:49:04,419 --> 04:49:18,560
Elephants are attracted to people in trees. And plus

2038
04:49:18,560 --> 04:49:22,740
another thing about emulators, that I'm not entirely sure everybody

2039
04:49:22,740 --> 04:49:29,220
is aware of this, they're illegal. Like, as like

2040
04:49:29,220 --> 04:49:33,220
a streamer, as somebody who is broadcasting themselves to the internet,

2041
04:49:33,220 --> 04:49:38,099
hey guys, like, I don't own this shit. I just downloaded it online

2042
04:49:38,099 --> 04:49:44,959
for free. It's kind of just inviting an issue

2043
04:49:44,959 --> 04:49:52,529
potentially. Emulators aren't, but ROMs can be.

2044
04:49:52,529 --> 04:49:58,099
There's a lot of weird, there's a lot of weird slippery

2045
04:49:58,099 --> 04:50:11,490
legislature with like emulating video games.

2046
04:50:11,490 --> 04:50:15,490
So let's say for instance, let's say I got a

2047
04:50:15,490 --> 04:50:19,490
RCS, PS3, whatever it is.

2048
04:50:19,490 --> 04:50:23,490
Let's say I got that emulator and I downloaded this game and I don't own it.

2049
04:50:23,490 --> 04:50:27,490
Let's say I just streamed this game on an emulator without buying or owning the game.

2050
04:50:27,490 --> 04:50:39,220
You're not supposed to do that. But I do own it.

2051
04:50:39,220 --> 04:50:44,740
But why would I, why would I emulate this now? There's no reason for me to

2052
04:50:44,740 --> 04:50:49,110
emulate this game. Do we have a stray baby elephant with no tusks for

2053
04:50:49,110 --> 04:51:00,880
no reason? What? It has tusks. What are you doing out here?

2054
04:51:00,880 --> 04:51:16,439
Now you could also argue, like for instance, if a game

2055
04:51:16,439 --> 04:51:20,610
is actually not even viable, like

2056
04:51:20,610 --> 04:51:26,580
straight up you can't get it anywhere. And alright, maybe it's

2057
04:51:26,580 --> 04:51:38,950
how else are you going to play it, right? Emulation and ROMs are actually

2058
04:51:38,950 --> 04:51:44,580
what they're doing is they're backing up the

2059
04:51:44,580 --> 04:51:48,580
history of video games. As you saw recently with all this shit

2060
04:51:48,580 --> 04:51:52,580
with the Wii Shop channel and you know, games going into

2061
04:51:52,580 --> 04:51:56,580
abandoned ware. Oh, it's like this random Super Nintendo game that you will never

2062
04:51:56,580 --> 04:52:00,580
see, you will never play, you will never find ever again. There are no copies that are in

2063
04:52:00,580 --> 04:52:04,580
circulation anymore. You can argue that there's a reason to

2064
04:52:04,580 --> 04:52:16,240
have backups of video games forever. But

2065
04:52:16,240 --> 04:52:21,639
if I have the means to do it and I've tried doing emulation before

2066
04:52:21,639 --> 04:52:26,000
and it just always had like some random problem that was like, oh

2067
04:52:26,000 --> 04:52:30,000
well that's good, it's the emulator. It's like, well fuck, okay, well why don't I just get the damn thing

2068
04:52:30,000 --> 04:52:34,000
for real and not have to worry about any potential issues that pop up from

2069
04:52:34,000 --> 04:52:38,000
emulating like a last generation game. Is that a baby up there?

2070
04:52:38,000 --> 04:52:46,150
And there's even a list online of PS3 emulated

2071
04:52:46,150 --> 04:52:52,310
games and how much they function. It's like, oh this one

2072
04:52:52,310 --> 04:52:56,310
like kind of works. This one doesn't work. This one doesn't work at all. This one like loads

2073
04:52:56,310 --> 04:53:01,380
past level four. Like you can actually see which ones are even

2074
04:53:01,380 --> 04:53:05,380
being like worked on to help, you know. What are you doing out here?

2075
04:53:05,380 --> 04:53:19,439
That's the one that I chased away. Well, why?

2076
04:53:19,439 --> 04:53:25,330
How am I supposed to do this? If at any given moment

2077
04:53:25,330 --> 04:53:29,759
if one or two troops of elephants spawn

2078
04:53:29,759 --> 04:53:35,319
then all of them have tusks.

2079
04:53:35,319 --> 04:53:56,869
How much do you find, monster?

2080
04:53:56,869 --> 04:54:08,400
What are your thoughts on games being forcibly removed due to licensing issues like

2081
04:54:08,400 --> 04:54:13,669
the Scott Pilgrim game on PS3? I don't know, I'm kind of

2082
04:54:13,669 --> 04:54:17,669
of the opinion that if you fucking made something and you've released it and people bought it and

2083
04:54:17,669 --> 04:54:21,669
you sold it, are you really going to be upset that people want

2084
04:54:21,669 --> 04:54:26,610
to buy it and still play it and resell it?

2085
04:54:26,610 --> 04:54:42,610
It's like, you already did it. Here comes another troop. Yeah, just stay in the car, Eric.

2086
04:54:42,610 --> 04:54:47,240
Everything will be fine. Tusks. Put this down.

2087
04:54:47,240 --> 04:54:53,330
Binoculars and more. Can I please get a baby with no tusks? You have

2088
04:54:53,330 --> 04:55:03,520
tusks. Did I actually hit the wall in this game? I may have.

2089
04:55:03,520 --> 04:55:21,000
Is this the soft lock mission? Find two elephants having

2090
04:55:21,000 --> 04:55:32,979
sex and then follow them for nine months. This is the boss battle? No.

2091
04:55:32,979 --> 04:55:39,330
It wouldn't have like a cool cut scene. Nine months?

2092
04:55:39,330 --> 04:55:49,400
Wait, hold on. A baby, an elephant is pregnant for

2093
04:55:49,400 --> 04:55:55,599
32 months? Look at that. Oh my

2094
04:55:55,599 --> 04:56:04,880
god. Almost two years of pregnancy.

2095
04:56:04,880 --> 04:56:16,360
Humans come out too early. Yeah, they are massive when they come out. Yeah, that's

2096
04:56:16,360 --> 04:56:25,840
true. Alright, can I like cheat this game and put cheat codes

2097
04:56:25,840 --> 04:56:31,799
in and just skip this one? Maybe I have to

2098
04:56:31,799 --> 04:56:37,509
get in a tree. Maybe that's part of it. Maybe I have to trigger the

2099
04:56:37,509 --> 04:56:50,900
cut scene. Let me look at this one more time. Does this have any info on it for me?

2100
04:56:50,900 --> 04:56:58,020
Client, Irino, African, elephant,

2101
04:56:58,020 --> 04:57:13,189
calf. Cheated enough for

2102
04:57:13,189 --> 04:57:28,549
one scream? What do you mean? Cheated? I'm gonna get in

2103
04:57:28,549 --> 04:57:32,549
this and see if I trigger a cut scene or something because it did say that I could get up.

2104
04:57:32,549 --> 04:57:46,439
Snap a baby elephant. Give me a cut scene.

2105
04:57:46,439 --> 04:57:55,479
Oh god damn it is a fucking cut scene. I can't believe it. I've been

2106
04:57:55,479 --> 04:58:01,830
driving around in circles for like 30, 40 minutes. Look, there's a

2107
04:58:01,830 --> 04:58:05,830
calf or the elephant herd. I took the wrong photos. Oh, there it is. There's the

2108
04:58:05,830 --> 04:58:16,080
one with no tusks. Descripted. Descripted event.

2109
04:58:16,080 --> 04:58:22,759
Good. This is the boss. Snap parent and child African elephant.

2110
04:58:22,759 --> 04:58:45,400
Which one is the parent? Not bad.

2111
04:58:45,400 --> 04:58:50,720
I don't like this one. I don't like this. I don't like this. Change it. Change it. Change it. Change it. Change it.

2112
04:58:50,720 --> 04:59:38,340
Manual. Fuck! Get out of the shot. Out of the shot. Go!

2113
04:59:38,340 --> 05:00:45,970
Bye. Let's see what my best photo was. You don't just kind of want one.

2114
05:00:45,970 --> 05:00:56,279
Elephants? Could you have an elephant as a pet?

2115
05:00:56,279 --> 05:01:05,810
If you had a huge backyard and you put up like T-Rex fences

2116
05:01:05,810 --> 05:01:09,810
I'm talking you own like 40 acres. Like 50 acres of land.

2117
05:01:09,810 --> 05:01:14,180
100 acres of land. And you have man-made pools and

2118
05:01:14,180 --> 05:01:24,119
man-made shrubbery and bushes and shit.

2119
05:01:24,119 --> 05:01:29,319
Which one is the good one? The black and... No it's not!

2120
05:01:29,319 --> 05:01:33,319
The last black and white photo I took was way better than all these.

2121
05:01:33,319 --> 05:01:45,169
Really cared for the young. Well how did it go? Did you get your photos of the baby elephant?

2122
05:01:45,169 --> 05:01:55,750
I did. Yeah you have like 100 acres of land. You have walls

2123
05:01:55,750 --> 05:02:05,279
surrounding the whole thing. And you have one giant elephant.

2124
05:02:05,279 --> 05:02:09,279
Yeah and like some of you guys said you could have another part of land. Let's say you own 100 acres.

2125
05:02:09,279 --> 05:02:13,279
Like 10 acres could be for elephants. Like 5, 10 acres could be

2126
05:02:13,279 --> 05:02:17,279
for bears. Get a couple of bears. Make sure they're all fenced off completely.

2127
05:02:17,279 --> 05:02:22,229
Maybe have like a penguin exhibit too. Like get ice

2128
05:02:22,229 --> 05:02:36,770
shipped in. Like 50 acres or something. Who's gonna clean it?

2129
05:02:36,770 --> 05:02:41,009
You can hire a staff. You know if you have that kind of money to have an elephant

2130
05:02:41,009 --> 05:02:45,009
for a pet you probably have money to spend. So you hire like

2131
05:02:45,009 --> 05:02:50,849
100 people. 100 staff to take care of the animals.

2132
05:02:50,849 --> 05:02:54,849
And then maybe have like a little area

2133
05:02:54,849 --> 05:02:58,849
that's small. Like a building that you develop that has like stuffed animals

2134
05:02:58,849 --> 05:03:03,799
in it. Of the animals that are there. And coloring books and shit.

2135
05:03:03,799 --> 05:03:07,970
And then you could like invite people over to come and hang out.

2136
05:03:07,970 --> 05:03:26,099
I love how much people hate this.

2137
05:03:26,099 --> 05:03:36,549
And yeah yeah you could charge. Just you know to cover the costs

2138
05:03:36,549 --> 05:03:40,549
of you know you have like pet elephants and pet bears and shit. Like $20 to come and look

2139
05:03:40,549 --> 05:03:50,869
around. Alright I don't know how this one

2140
05:03:50,869 --> 05:04:01,169
the composition of this one is not. This one is way better.

2141
05:04:01,169 --> 05:04:05,169
Look at the depth of field on this one. This one's like 5 times better.

2142
05:04:05,169 --> 05:04:25,840
This is really the best algorithm. It's

2143
05:04:25,840 --> 05:04:30,150
because of the mother pushing up. I guess.

2144
05:04:30,150 --> 05:04:43,970
Well that's apparently the best one so I'm gonna listen to the game.

2145
05:04:43,970 --> 05:04:49,599
Accidental black and white photo? Accidental?

2146
05:04:49,599 --> 05:04:56,639
Now I turned it on. I did that intentionally. That's a lot of money.

2147
05:04:56,639 --> 05:05:04,150
How could the angle not be better than that? Considering they told

2148
05:05:04,150 --> 05:05:09,409
me to go in this tree. This was a cut scene. I got cut

2149
05:05:09,409 --> 05:05:13,409
into this angle and it was a bad angle. That's not my fault.

2150
05:05:13,409 --> 05:05:25,720
Another job done and we're still on one piece. Tomorrow we start early. Let's get some rest.

2151
05:05:25,720 --> 05:05:38,450
He was supposed to be on top of the elephant. Good morning Francine.

2152
05:05:38,450 --> 05:05:48,240
Be sure to check your email. Sending map new area. Alright

2153
05:05:48,240 --> 05:05:55,860
I think this might be one of the last areas. New camera. Thank you for your continued

2154
05:05:55,860 --> 05:05:59,860
business. In today's newsletter we'd like to let our A100 users know

2155
05:05:59,860 --> 05:06:03,860
the product they've been waiting for has finally arrived. A 24 to

2156
05:06:03,860 --> 05:06:07,860
105mm f-stop of 3.5 to 4.5 is an interchangeable

2157
05:06:07,860 --> 05:06:11,860
lens for the A series. Switch lenses and

2158
05:06:11,860 --> 05:06:15,860
power up your photography. Pro shop for more details.

2159
05:06:15,860 --> 05:06:25,200
We got a new area. The Choroa Gorge.

2160
05:06:25,200 --> 05:06:29,200
Harsh lands surrounded by rocks and sand.

2161
05:06:29,200 --> 05:06:39,189
Let's research the area. We're gonna get an ad.

2162
05:06:39,189 --> 05:06:54,040
We're actually getting a fucking ad. Clever.

2163
05:06:54,040 --> 05:06:58,720
Alright well there it is. Wide angle to mid range telephoto.

2164
05:06:58,720 --> 05:07:07,110
Let's do it. Compact. High power standard. Zoom.

2165
05:07:07,110 --> 05:07:16,529
Wide angle. Beautiful. This whole game

2166
05:07:16,529 --> 05:07:26,639
is really just product placement. It's funny because back in the day

2167
05:07:26,639 --> 05:07:31,250
here. 2007, 2008.

2168
05:07:31,250 --> 05:07:39,970
I like how desperate are you Sony. Canon was the leader here.

2169
05:07:39,970 --> 05:07:43,970
Alright so this is the telephoto. We're gonna get some cool photographs with this one.

2170
05:07:43,970 --> 05:07:52,040
Is Canon still the leader? Wouldn't surprise me at all. They make

2171
05:07:52,040 --> 05:08:09,509
high quality fucking cameras. I still haven't used this at all.

2172
05:08:09,509 --> 05:08:13,680
This is a next level sponsored stream. Play a game

2173
05:08:13,680 --> 05:08:17,680
that has a competitor advertising all over the place and have streamer

2174
05:08:17,680 --> 05:08:21,680
talk about how dumb it is and bad it is and then mention Canon once

2175
05:08:21,680 --> 05:08:25,680
and subliminally get that

2176
05:08:25,680 --> 05:08:30,630
message inside of the consumers head. I'm having trouble with words tonight.

2177
05:08:30,630 --> 05:08:41,250
I don't know why. That one's better so I'm gonna get rid of these.

2178
05:08:41,250 --> 05:08:49,779
Nope. Keep these. I have to have a bunch of memories from each encounter.

2179
05:08:49,779 --> 05:08:59,000
Alright let's go explore the new area. All DSLRs

2180
05:08:59,000 --> 05:09:04,840
are the same. Canon is definitely still

2181
05:09:04,840 --> 05:09:15,959
the best. What do they got now? Didn't Kodak literally

2182
05:09:15,959 --> 05:09:28,240
go bankrupt? Did they? Canon's not worth the money.

2183
05:09:28,240 --> 05:09:46,209
It's Nikon now. Nikon's the best now?

2184
05:09:46,209 --> 05:09:50,959
Nikon's doing well.

2185
05:09:50,959 --> 05:09:57,830
Nikon's doing alright in the

2186
05:09:57,830 --> 05:10:03,650
consumer level. You buy a Nikon

2187
05:10:03,650 --> 05:10:07,959
T2100 whatever series

2188
05:10:07,959 --> 05:10:12,840
and you bring it on vacation and take nice pictures. You bring

2189
05:10:12,840 --> 05:10:16,840
that to Vegas and you take a picture of Excalibur at the hotel and you're like oh that was

2190
05:10:16,840 --> 05:10:20,840
worth like in the consumer $280

2191
05:10:20,840 --> 05:10:41,330
kind of nice consumer level.

2192
05:10:41,330 --> 05:10:45,330
I find Sony to be the best for photography.

2193
05:10:45,330 --> 05:10:49,330
Photography? Holy shit Jeremy.

2194
05:10:49,330 --> 05:10:53,330
Get your fucking head screwed on. Photographing.

2195
05:10:53,330 --> 05:10:58,720
What's wrong with me tonight? I tell you the high winds I must have

2196
05:10:58,720 --> 05:11:06,099
blown my brain around in my skull. It was crazy though.

2197
05:11:06,099 --> 05:11:10,099
Let me tell you. Vitalix and I were outside just

2198
05:11:10,099 --> 05:11:14,099
curing shit because the wind can cause damage. We're making sure

2199
05:11:14,099 --> 05:11:18,099
we don't lose stuff that can fly around and around the house.

2200
05:11:18,099 --> 05:11:22,099
Outside the house and all that shit. This was like a movie. This was like being on set

2201
05:11:22,099 --> 05:11:26,099
in a fucking tornado themed movie. It was terrifying.

2202
05:11:26,099 --> 05:11:33,279
It was at the point where you had to lean into the wind or you were going to fall

2203
05:11:33,279 --> 05:11:38,549
over. Plant your feet and stuff your back into the huge 60

2204
05:11:38,549 --> 05:11:54,290
fucking mile per hour gust or you're going down. It was crazy.

2205
05:11:54,290 --> 05:12:00,389
Close your mouth or your dentures will fly out.

2206
05:12:00,389 --> 05:12:05,779
Open your mouth for a second and you can see it just skyrocket over the horizon.

2207
05:12:05,779 --> 05:12:12,319
New zone? This is not the new zone. Why do you have to drive so slow through the new

2208
05:12:12,319 --> 05:12:20,770
areas? Las Vegas doesn't ever get that type of weather does it?

2209
05:12:20,770 --> 05:12:25,459
From my understanding, not the rain.

2210
05:12:25,459 --> 05:12:30,919
The rain is something that doesn't happen very often. So we got to shitload of rain.

2211
05:12:30,919 --> 05:12:34,919
I think they actually broke a record yesterday.

2212
05:12:34,919 --> 05:12:38,919
The most rain ever in one day, at least on Valentine's Day,

2213
05:12:38,919 --> 05:12:43,279
broke a record somehow. But the wind from my understanding

2214
05:12:43,279 --> 05:12:47,279
is it happens a lot. Vegas is a very windy

2215
05:12:47,279 --> 05:12:53,360
city. But being here for about four and a half

2216
05:12:53,360 --> 05:12:58,759
months, we've never experienced that. More than like

2217
05:12:58,759 --> 05:13:05,169
60 plus mile per hour wind gusts. So it does get windy

2218
05:13:05,169 --> 05:13:09,169
around here but it can get pretty extreme sometimes.

2219
05:13:09,169 --> 05:13:33,569
I don't even know where the hell it comes from. I actually kind of like that picture.

2220
05:13:33,569 --> 05:13:43,990
I really like this. Can you run over animal?

2221
05:13:43,990 --> 05:13:51,560
You cannot run over animal. Has the minimum changed yet?

2222
05:13:51,560 --> 05:13:55,799
Not yet. The minimum is changing over the next couple of days though.

2223
05:13:55,799 --> 05:14:00,549
So just to make sure you're aware, the bit minimum is

2224
05:14:00,549 --> 05:14:08,880
increasing to 250. 250 is the new bit reading

2225
05:14:08,880 --> 05:14:12,880
minimum. As of like now.

2226
05:14:12,880 --> 05:14:17,119
But not as of this stream.

2227
05:14:17,119 --> 05:14:21,119
If that makes any sense. So in the next few streams we're going to slowly

2228
05:14:21,119 --> 05:14:29,459
transition it. I did bring it down from three because

2229
05:14:29,459 --> 05:14:33,459
some of the things that people were saying, there were some good points

2230
05:14:33,459 --> 05:14:38,319
about how buying bits makes a three dollar

2231
05:14:38,319 --> 05:14:42,319
minimum sort of awkward because they don't come in threes, they come in

2232
05:14:42,319 --> 05:14:48,799
fives. How do you slowly transition that?

2233
05:14:48,799 --> 05:14:52,979
It's instantly over one day. But over the course of the last

2234
05:14:52,979 --> 05:14:56,979
three weeks or so, almost about a month, I've been slowly telling everybody

2235
05:14:56,979 --> 05:15:00,979
that it's going to happen in mid-February. So I mean

2236
05:15:00,979 --> 05:15:04,979
I have slowly been telling everybody it was going to happen in mid-February and now we're in mid-February.

2237
05:15:04,979 --> 05:15:10,500
It's going to take one day. Are there ostriches here?

2238
05:15:10,500 --> 05:15:22,470
There are ostriches in Africa? I thought these were like

2239
05:15:22,470 --> 05:15:31,509
only in New Zealand. Isn't this like the New Zealand state bird?

2240
05:15:31,509 --> 05:15:44,040
That's a good photo. That's emus.

2241
05:15:44,040 --> 05:16:01,939
Wait. Let's put it on auto for now. No get

2242
05:16:01,939 --> 05:16:20,840
the fucking black and white off. Well let's start surveying from this location.

2243
05:16:20,840 --> 05:16:28,279
Francine, why don't you take the wheel. Well there's an actual

2244
05:16:28,279 --> 05:16:33,540
camera emulator. Yeah. It has all the settings.

2245
05:16:33,540 --> 05:16:38,340
That's why this game is really... Can I just drop this guy off?

2246
05:16:38,340 --> 05:16:43,860
You actually don't have a reason to be here. Let me get out and get a good picture of this. Never mind.

2247
05:16:43,860 --> 05:16:59,990
Let's go. That guy's just back there smoking a blunt. Okay slow

2248
05:16:59,990 --> 05:17:08,319
down. Let me get a good one. This is a good horizon here. Now you're ruining

2249
05:17:08,319 --> 05:17:24,959
the shot. Get out of the way. Nice. Nice. Oh you're getting close.

2250
05:17:24,959 --> 05:17:39,700
Oh work with me here. Work with me here. Look at this one.

2251
05:17:39,700 --> 05:17:44,130
Whoa. I love it. I love it. I hope you just get out of the way.

2252
05:17:44,130 --> 05:17:48,130
I gotta get a little tighter. I don't want that little deer in the way. Come on. Come on.

2253
05:17:48,130 --> 05:18:08,240
Come on. This is like a fucking car commercial. Do it. Do it. Do it. He's using the

2254
05:18:08,240 --> 05:18:29,490
rule of search. I like that one. There's nothing wrong with

2255
05:18:29,490 --> 05:18:44,849
this photo. Why is that such a bad thing? That one's really good too.

2256
05:18:44,849 --> 05:18:53,319
That one actually might be the best one. Why not a different shutter?

2257
05:18:53,319 --> 05:19:07,720
Well because I want my photos to look awful. I can make one of these

2258
05:19:07,720 --> 05:19:16,229
my desktop background. Oh that's some pretty good photos. I like the

2259
05:19:16,229 --> 05:19:24,930
landscape here. Kubwa rock. Put your ISO at

2260
05:19:24,930 --> 05:19:34,740
12,000. Any more wildlife? Probably rhinos here.

2261
05:19:34,740 --> 05:19:42,819
I need to get a good picture of Oscar. All right we got something else over here.

2262
05:19:42,819 --> 05:19:49,169
What's this? Where are the lions? This has got to be the lion

2263
05:19:49,169 --> 05:20:10,360
zone. It has to be. New bird. One of those will be good enough.

2264
05:20:10,360 --> 05:20:29,959
Let's do a real slow, slow fucking shutter.

2265
05:20:29,959 --> 05:21:00,229
Stop moving. It's too bright. No. Get out of the menu.

2266
05:21:00,229 --> 05:21:15,459
Okay. Manual. Other

2267
05:21:15,459 --> 05:21:38,259
direction. You gotta go up. You gotta close the iris. Not open it.

2268
05:21:38,259 --> 05:22:18,709
Stay right there. Right there. Right there. Stay. Stay. Stay. Stay. Right there. Right there. There it is.

2269
05:22:18,709 --> 05:22:33,029
Stay there. Right there. Look at that. No I moved.

2270
05:22:33,029 --> 05:22:39,380
No. No. No. No. No. It's just shutter. The shutter. That was perfect. The shutter

2271
05:22:39,380 --> 05:22:43,750
has got to be quicker than that. Oh he walked by at the right time. Don't move.

2272
05:22:43,750 --> 05:22:56,549
Walk into frame. Come on. Walk into frame so I can get the good

2273
05:22:56,549 --> 05:23:13,000
depth of field here. I'll follow you as long as I need to.

2274
05:23:13,000 --> 05:23:19,330
I'll get it. It's going to be a good one. Watch this. Oh if I was only a

2275
05:23:19,330 --> 05:23:25,880
little bit. Come on. I need you like down here.

2276
05:23:25,880 --> 05:23:40,259
I gotta move. Opportunity is knocking right now. You dumb

2277
05:23:40,259 --> 05:24:17,639
dickhead. That was what I wanted. This one's not bad. I don't mind

2278
05:24:17,639 --> 05:24:25,330
this one. Yeah this is the. We finally got the. I got the right exposure here.

2279
05:24:25,330 --> 05:24:36,529
Whoops. Can you imagine. If it was a little turn the other

2280
05:24:36,529 --> 05:24:41,590
way. Can you imagine how good this one would have been. It's still alright.

2281
05:24:41,590 --> 05:24:46,080
If I could have gone. I need a bigger lens. I want to go closer. Go right

2282
05:24:46,080 --> 05:25:10,720
up in his face. But I can't do that. I need a better shutter.

2283
05:25:10,720 --> 05:25:43,119
No. Every one of you fucking dumb inputs are wrong.

2284
05:25:43,119 --> 05:25:58,290
I need to get a better lens. Can I just buy one.

2285
05:25:58,290 --> 05:26:02,290
No live preview when adjusting the settings. Yeah that's the one unfortunate thing. You only

2286
05:26:02,290 --> 05:26:06,290
get the pre. It shows you what you got. Actually hold on.

2287
05:26:06,290 --> 05:26:15,639
All of you stay right there. If I can get in front.

2288
05:26:15,639 --> 05:26:57,729
Wait wait wait. Shhh. No no no. God.

2289
05:26:57,729 --> 05:27:07,650
Come this way. Come on. I need a tree right here.

2290
05:27:07,650 --> 05:28:02,290
Fuck. It's alright. Close enough. That's what I want.

2291
05:28:02,290 --> 05:28:11,330
I want it to be a little darker. I don't want it blown out. I need one of them to

2292
05:28:11,330 --> 05:28:20,290
go through that tree. I need to get up here. Master plan. Come on.

2293
05:28:20,290 --> 05:28:25,409
What I want. I want. I want one of you to go through here.

2294
05:28:25,409 --> 05:28:30,419
Like that. And I get you right in the middle. I'm going to go a little closer.

2295
05:28:30,419 --> 05:28:48,020
Oh fuck it. Whatever. I'm taking this too seriously. This is fun.

2296
05:28:48,020 --> 05:28:56,740
Press R3. It drops bait for the animal.

2297
05:28:56,740 --> 05:29:00,919
Add that to the list of bullshit things I've heard in the last two days.

2298
05:29:00,919 --> 05:29:24,849
Can I have them take the wheel so I can take a photo? Guys don't you know

2299
05:29:24,849 --> 05:29:29,919
that a photographer will take two thousand photos

2300
05:29:29,919 --> 05:29:33,919
at an event or something they're hired for. And only like

2301
05:29:33,919 --> 05:29:57,220
four of them are going to get used. Oh it's fast. I can see that one.

2302
05:29:57,220 --> 05:30:05,750
If only it was a little bit more.

2303
05:30:05,750 --> 05:30:14,439
Oh you're coming right at me. I got a chance. What are you doing?

2304
05:30:14,439 --> 05:30:19,250
Wow. Meerkats. That's the first piece of dialogue you've had in four days, Eric.

2305
05:30:19,250 --> 05:32:03,759
Shut up. I'm putting the camera right in there. I'm trying so hard

2306
05:32:03,759 --> 05:32:07,759
to not make any noise. I'm hopping right now. What are you doing?

2307
05:32:07,759 --> 05:32:12,450
Nobody walks like that. Nice stealth

2308
05:32:12,450 --> 05:32:19,939
walk. Look at how majestic this bird is.

2309
05:32:19,939 --> 05:32:59,490
I got to get closer to this. What are you?

2310
05:32:59,490 --> 05:33:19,330
No, no, no, no. No. Shit you threw it in the photo.

2311
05:33:19,330 --> 05:33:30,840
You dick. That's a pretty good class picture. Okay I'm gone.

2312
05:33:30,840 --> 05:33:38,389
It's really weird. Okay.

2313
05:33:38,389 --> 05:33:53,560
What was I doing? Oh yeah meerkats. That's a good one. Perfect straight line.

2314
05:33:53,560 --> 05:34:05,250
Right in the middle. Alright I got to go to the meerkats.

2315
05:34:05,250 --> 05:34:09,619
What hole are they in? I'm just going to hide. Maybe I shouldn't park the jeep in front of the holes.

2316
05:34:09,619 --> 05:34:28,950
That's good. So let's wait. I'm going to put the binoculars out.

2317
05:34:28,950 --> 05:34:32,950
That's a good spot. Is there a tree I can climb or something? What about up here?

2318
05:34:32,950 --> 05:34:42,500
Can I get up there? No that's a wall. It's an actual wall that I can't climb.

2319
05:34:42,500 --> 05:34:46,500
Why can't I just stand on the jeep? That seems like a perfectly

2320
05:34:46,500 --> 05:35:04,849
swell place to stand. Look at the angle.

2321
05:35:04,849 --> 05:35:11,250
Just park the jeep over the holes. What kind of monster are you?

2322
05:35:11,250 --> 05:35:15,680
No I'm just going to sit here. I'm going to wait until one shows their head.

2323
05:35:15,680 --> 05:35:42,119
And I'm going to whip the camera out and snap. They pop up right?

2324
05:35:42,119 --> 05:35:56,369
Come on. Are they just holes? Just look for other holes.

2325
05:35:56,369 --> 05:36:05,569
Maybe. Alright let me look for other holes.

2326
05:36:05,569 --> 05:36:26,240
Don't run across. Don't run across. What are you doing?

2327
05:36:26,240 --> 05:36:30,240
Break the truck. You cannot unfortunately. I wish you could.

2328
05:36:30,240 --> 05:36:36,959
That would have definitely caused some damage.

2329
05:36:36,959 --> 05:36:47,650
Kobe Sand. Some other type of animal here.

2330
05:36:47,650 --> 05:36:53,169
Tigers? Lions? There's got to be a lion in this game. You can't have it take photos

2331
05:36:53,169 --> 05:36:57,169
of animals game and not have a lion in this area.

2332
05:36:57,169 --> 05:37:15,270
There's no way. Can I climb this tree? It's a pretty good view but there's nothing

2333
05:37:15,270 --> 05:37:23,060
here. What the hell is that? No it's just a random animal.

2334
05:37:23,060 --> 05:37:30,610
A bird? What kind of bird is that? Is that like a pheasant?

2335
05:37:30,610 --> 05:37:41,169
That is the equivalent of a bird Chadwalk. It's

2336
05:37:41,169 --> 05:38:05,700
gold too. We've got to take a picture of the golden bird. It's just a dumb

2337
05:38:05,700 --> 05:38:15,110
vulture. Okay. What's supposed to be over here?

2338
05:38:15,110 --> 05:38:28,180
I think it's a meerkat but let's go back and turn some of these in.

2339
05:38:28,180 --> 05:38:32,180
The meerkats are too scared to come out of their burrow. There must be a way. Let's request new equipment from the head office.

2340
05:38:32,180 --> 05:38:45,880
I couldn't do anything. Give me a break. I took a lot of pictures didn't I?

2341
05:38:45,880 --> 05:38:52,610
Alright we've got our email. We're going to do wildlife research. Any new animals?

2342
05:38:52,610 --> 05:38:58,639
We have a few. What's a good one?

2343
05:38:58,639 --> 05:39:08,950
Golden vulture.

2344
05:39:08,950 --> 05:39:13,509
Why are the bird pictures with bad framing?

2345
05:39:13,509 --> 05:39:24,849
This is one of the most highly sought after images.

2346
05:39:24,849 --> 05:39:32,099
We've got the good class picture of the ostrich.

2347
05:39:32,099 --> 05:39:37,029
This has got to be a full block for everything right?

2348
05:39:37,029 --> 05:39:42,740
God damn it. Distance by a hair and technique by a hair.

2349
05:39:42,740 --> 05:39:54,720
Oh well. Okay let's see. There's the photo bomb. I'm going to keep that one.

2350
05:39:54,720 --> 05:40:00,040
This one sucks. This one's kind of cool but sucks.

2351
05:40:00,040 --> 05:40:04,279
I don't know what this picture is of. I was trying to go for some artsy

2352
05:40:04,279 --> 05:40:08,279
stuff with everything in the foreground was out of focus.

2353
05:40:08,279 --> 05:40:13,799
They were in focus but my subject was not cooperating.

2354
05:40:13,799 --> 05:40:30,360
That one's not bad. I like this one.

2355
05:40:30,360 --> 05:40:51,939
That one's good. This one's fine. That's a good one.

2356
05:40:51,939 --> 05:41:03,139
That one causes a headache. I'm progressively trying to change

2357
05:41:03,139 --> 05:41:08,979
the aperture and the shutter. See typically

2358
05:41:08,979 --> 05:41:14,099
you go through and you delete all these. It slowly gets better

2359
05:41:14,099 --> 05:41:18,099
and then you got the fucking money shot which is right here.

2360
05:41:18,099 --> 05:41:26,040
This one actually is more pleasing to me. Let them evaluate

2361
05:41:26,040 --> 05:41:34,869
this one? No. The same bird? It is.

2362
05:41:34,869 --> 05:41:39,430
That's pretty great. Can't you just see a logo

2363
05:41:39,430 --> 05:41:43,909
right in the middle there? That's perfect template

2364
05:41:43,909 --> 05:41:55,430
for two or three words for your business.

2365
05:41:55,430 --> 05:42:02,790
I think that's a better one too. That's pretty good. I think that works for what they're looking for.

2366
05:42:02,790 --> 05:42:12,020
Come on, give me a perfect. God damn it.

2367
05:42:12,020 --> 05:42:20,360
Then there was one more photo of an animal.

2368
05:42:20,360 --> 05:42:28,849
Where is it? No, not the baby running away scared.

2369
05:42:28,849 --> 05:42:34,419
Maybe that's it. No, that's it.

2370
05:42:34,419 --> 05:42:41,200
Let's delete some of these. These are

2371
05:42:41,200 --> 05:42:45,200
terrible. I like both of these. I'm keeping both.

2372
05:42:45,200 --> 05:42:49,759
This one's dumb. Don't like it. Don't want any of these.

2373
05:42:49,759 --> 05:42:54,840
None of these are worth saving. None of these are worth saving.

2374
05:42:54,840 --> 05:42:58,840
It's just a job. You know what I mean? No, don't get rid of the

2375
05:42:58,840 --> 05:43:06,080
advertising template. But here's the

2376
05:43:06,080 --> 05:43:11,029
marketing template. It's good to

2377
05:43:11,029 --> 05:43:15,029
have two templates because this giraffe is paying attention to

2378
05:43:15,029 --> 05:43:19,029
whatever the company or logo is in the middle of the screen. This giraffe

2379
05:43:19,029 --> 05:43:23,029
is paying attention to you. It cares about you and your interests.

2380
05:43:23,029 --> 05:43:27,520
So the logo on the screen is there for the company but this giraffe is endorsing it

2381
05:43:27,520 --> 05:43:31,520
and looking to you on how you feel about it.

2382
05:43:31,520 --> 05:43:48,099
Instead of what the giraffe feels about the company. I'll keep them both.

2383
05:43:48,099 --> 05:43:58,979
I'll get rid of this one. Keep that one. I'm gonna run out of space. Any more space?

2384
05:43:58,979 --> 05:44:08,950
Keep that one. Okay, delete. I'm assuming we're probably gonna get

2385
05:44:08,950 --> 05:44:17,650
a mission. But the giraffe could also

2386
05:44:17,650 --> 05:44:21,650
symbolize a person targeted by the advertisement so the one with it looking at the logo would be better.

2387
05:44:21,650 --> 05:44:27,090
Could be. That's all on the marketing firm that

2388
05:44:27,090 --> 05:44:32,919
decides to pay for those pictures. I'm just the photographer.

2389
05:44:32,919 --> 05:44:39,139
They interpret, not me. Oh, there's a lot here. Thanks for the other day.

2390
05:44:39,139 --> 05:44:44,400
Amazing animals editorial desk. My boss loved the giraffe photo. Thanks for

2391
05:44:44,400 --> 05:44:48,639
saving my bacon. Hey, by the way, have you ever seen ostriches court

2392
05:44:48,639 --> 05:44:52,639
each other? If not, you should check it out. It's quite a spectacle.

2393
05:44:52,639 --> 05:44:56,639
And by check it out, I mean snap me a photo. I'll use it in next month's Amazing

2394
05:44:56,639 --> 05:45:10,080
Animals. Cute little animal request.

2395
05:45:10,080 --> 05:45:14,080
One of the companies sponsoring our project requested you send a photo of a meerkat standing

2396
05:45:14,080 --> 05:45:18,450
up and looking around. However, you won't find a more vigilant

2397
05:45:18,450 --> 05:45:22,450
watchman than a meerkat. You'll have a rough time sneaking up on one without being noticed.

2398
05:45:22,450 --> 05:45:27,459
What was it just eating in that last frame? Oh,

2399
05:45:27,459 --> 05:45:31,830
the stick. Okay. Luckily, we were ready for this and have prepared new equipment

2400
05:45:31,830 --> 05:45:35,830
for you. Use it to get the photo. I can't do that now.

2401
05:45:35,830 --> 05:45:40,389
Doing the ostriches having sex with each other.

2402
05:45:40,389 --> 05:45:46,340
An animal that has a funny face. Hey, can you take a photo for our next issue?

2403
05:45:46,340 --> 05:45:50,709
We're doing a favorite funny animal faces. And I want you to put a picture

2404
05:45:50,709 --> 05:45:54,709
of a heart beast in the running. They have those long

2405
05:45:54,709 --> 05:45:58,709
slender faces. If you got a shot from head on, our readers would vote at number one, no

2406
05:45:58,709 --> 05:46:08,770
question. I deleted them all. Alright, I gotta get a good one of the funny

2407
05:46:08,770 --> 05:46:15,619
face. Trap cam on its way. Head office is sending

2408
05:46:15,619 --> 05:46:19,619
you new equipment. The trap cam lets you photograph subjects remotely.

2409
05:46:19,619 --> 05:46:23,619
Set up the camera where you want to take a photo, then trigger the shutter from a distance.

2410
05:46:23,619 --> 05:46:28,310
Feel free to use the trap cam for other research after you finish

2411
05:46:28,310 --> 05:46:32,799
taking the meerkat photo. Alright. Francine never heard of

2412
05:46:32,799 --> 05:46:36,799
the big five. There are five major animals people want to see on safaris.

2413
05:46:36,799 --> 05:46:40,799
The African elephant, the African buffalo, the rhino, the leopard, and the lion.

2414
05:46:40,799 --> 05:46:44,799
They're all tough to find, though. You'd have to be pretty lucky to spot them all.

2415
05:46:44,799 --> 05:46:51,590
Oh, there's the rare spawn. Alright, uh, ostrich is

2416
05:46:51,590 --> 05:46:57,409
doing courting. Okay. How do I

2417
05:46:57,409 --> 05:47:02,549
use? The male slowly rotates its wings and moves its head into figure

2418
05:47:02,549 --> 05:47:09,349
eight. It's quite exotic. How do I use the

2419
05:47:09,349 --> 05:47:17,169
trap cam? Shoot photos from a distance using infrared remote, custom for

2420
05:47:17,169 --> 05:47:21,169
tsetse cameras. How do I use it?

2421
05:47:21,169 --> 05:47:48,209
Wait a minute. I got the wrong camera. Oh, I don't want to do that. Ten hour joker?

2422
05:47:48,209 --> 05:47:59,299
It's the amateur camera. Alright, let's go with ostriches.

2423
05:47:59,299 --> 05:48:04,869
Ostriches. It's weird to say that name.

2424
05:48:04,869 --> 05:48:10,840
Ostriches. Hard to pronounce. Ostrich.

2425
05:48:10,840 --> 05:48:35,220
Ostrich. Okay. Capturing ostrich

2426
05:48:35,220 --> 05:48:41,880
in a mating ritual. Can't I just skip?

2427
05:48:41,880 --> 05:48:57,639
You can't put a base camp up in the other areas.

2428
05:48:57,639 --> 05:49:14,529
GTA bushes. Yeah, they're pretty bad.

2429
05:49:14,529 --> 05:49:20,549
So which way is the place we just worked? This way?

2430
05:49:20,549 --> 05:49:50,740
Fucking god. Do we have a problem in chat? Do we have

2431
05:49:50,740 --> 05:49:56,900
a problem right now in chat? Am I getting baited here or is this

2432
05:49:56,900 --> 05:50:00,900
actually the day that I get rid of links forever?

2433
05:50:00,900 --> 05:50:05,650
Okay. Alright, that's fine. Just remember,

2434
05:50:05,650 --> 05:50:24,290
the boy of fried wolf. Open it. I'm not going to open it.

2435
05:50:24,290 --> 05:50:36,209
I don't want to open it. Don't crash into that. It's going to stop you.

2436
05:50:37,209 --> 05:50:47,979
What is he going to do? Do I really have to go from the wetlands

2437
05:50:47,979 --> 05:50:51,979
to through the wetlands? Up through the other place.

2438
05:50:51,979 --> 05:51:08,380
Into the desert area. Do I actually have to do that?

2439
05:51:08,380 --> 05:51:22,779
Long loading screens. Guys, let's act like his camera's on.

2440
05:51:22,779 --> 05:51:39,930
His cam's on. That's not a fake message somebody actually wrote that.

2441
05:51:39,930 --> 05:51:54,750
What the fuck, dude?

2442
05:51:54,750 --> 05:52:00,080
No one said yes they did. Check the logs. Somebody wrote that.

2443
05:52:00,080 --> 05:52:08,799
Let's pretend. Oh, was it all capitals? That's why I turned that on.

2444
05:52:08,799 --> 05:52:18,009
Alright, we need an ostrich mating ritual.

2445
05:52:18,009 --> 05:52:35,080
Somebody did say that. I have the logs.

2446
05:52:35,080 --> 05:52:52,319
Show the logs? I'm not going to show logs. I don't have any logs.

2447
05:52:52,319 --> 05:52:58,799
It was a lie. I have a memory. Alright, get out.

2448
05:52:58,799 --> 05:53:06,939
See if there's a ritual right here. They moved the head into figure 8.

2449
05:53:06,939 --> 05:53:13,340
Like that? Is that one about to do it?

2450
05:53:13,340 --> 05:53:17,639
Is this one about to do the thing? He turned his head upside down.

2451
05:53:17,639 --> 05:53:29,849
He's going to do the thing. He's about to do it. I've got to get closer than that.

2452
05:53:29,849 --> 05:53:33,849
It looks like somebody squished his neck. Somebody accidentally stepped on his neck.

2453
05:53:33,849 --> 05:54:04,560
No. I wonder. Alright, you like Donald Duck.

2454
05:54:04,560 --> 05:54:33,040
Go find another Donald Duck. And let's get this over with.

2455
05:54:33,040 --> 05:54:38,430
Why are you not taking this moment to make a funny animal documentary?

2456
05:54:38,430 --> 05:54:44,650
What do you want me to say?

2457
05:54:44,650 --> 05:54:58,110
I already did that joke five years ago.

2458
05:54:58,110 --> 05:55:02,669
Okay, you want me to go like this. As you can see here,

2459
05:55:02,669 --> 05:55:06,669
the giraffe is drinking from the water. And to the left...

2460
05:55:06,669 --> 05:55:15,450
Here it is in action right now. It's doing like a turkey dance.

2461
05:55:15,450 --> 05:55:21,020
Alright, that's what I need to get. I got it already. That's what you guys wanted.

2462
05:55:21,020 --> 05:55:43,479
You don't want that. You'll do it again. So is this game any fun or is this whole

2463
05:55:43,479 --> 05:55:50,279
stream just a bit? That would be pretty long.

2464
05:55:50,279 --> 05:55:58,799
Six straight hours of a bit.

2465
05:55:58,799 --> 05:56:02,799
That's the whole stream. Been a bit. I got it.

2466
05:56:02,799 --> 05:56:11,580
Who cares if it's not worth anything?

2467
05:56:11,580 --> 05:56:15,580
You can't even see it. It's a very bad photo. This one's about to do it, right?

2468
05:56:15,580 --> 05:56:20,909
They get down on their knees and they start moving around in a circle.

2469
05:56:20,909 --> 05:56:30,200
They float their feathers out and they start moving their head around. I've got to get in front of them.

2470
05:56:30,200 --> 05:56:41,209
Have I tried only talking when I have something funny to say?

2471
05:56:41,209 --> 05:56:49,659
Why the hell would I do that?

2472
05:56:49,659 --> 05:56:53,659
If I would have just sit here silently, it would just be watching

2473
05:56:53,659 --> 05:56:57,659
a silent gameplay of PlayStation 3 safari photos.

2474
05:56:57,659 --> 05:57:15,389
Why in the name of fucking God would I ever do that?

2475
05:57:15,389 --> 05:58:08,889
Alright, I'll try it. I'll make it really...

2476
05:58:08,889 --> 05:58:12,889
This is not a joke. Hey, what's up guys? Chime in here. This is not a joke.

2477
05:58:12,889 --> 05:58:16,889
Did you guys actually know that the ostrich is one of the most closely

2478
05:58:16,889 --> 05:58:21,959
related animal to dinosaurs?

2479
05:58:21,959 --> 05:59:05,689
If I would have walked into my room right now and not...

2480
05:59:05,689 --> 05:59:09,689
I wasn't streaming this. This is a really weird fucking game.

2481
05:59:09,689 --> 05:59:13,689
Just to be playing. Just here.

2482
05:59:13,689 --> 05:59:18,889
I know it's not funny, but it is. Silently playing this game.

2483
05:59:18,889 --> 05:59:31,240
It feels weird to play this game in silence.

2484
05:59:31,240 --> 05:59:37,069
It just does. I'm sorry. You're not going to silence me.

2485
05:59:37,069 --> 05:59:52,430
It's immersing. Fine. Five straight minutes

2486
05:59:52,430 --> 06:03:32,990
of silence. I got something funny to say. That's a workout video.

2487
06:03:32,990 --> 06:03:36,990
That's a workout video. And I just got a picture of a workout video.

2488
06:03:36,990 --> 06:03:59,630
That's funny. I got it. Five more minutes. I can't fucking do it.

2489
06:03:59,630 --> 06:04:10,639
I only have three minutes. How was it? I'm not going to say that?

2490
06:04:10,639 --> 06:04:14,639
Alright, I can fucking do it. I'm doing it. I don't care if there's anything funny to say. I'm not going to say anything.

2491
06:04:14,639 --> 06:04:18,639
I swear to God. Five fucking minutes. I'm not going to talk. I'm not going to smirk

2492
06:04:18,639 --> 06:04:22,639
staring at the fucking screen playing my silent video game.

2493
06:04:22,639 --> 06:04:32,560
I'm going to keep the mic on this time so I can prove it.

2494
06:04:32,560 --> 06:04:37,369
Here it goes. Here it goes. Here it goes. Here it goes. Shut up. I already blew it.

2495
06:04:37,369 --> 06:04:42,189
It's already over. Start again. Right now. Go.

2496
06:04:42,189 --> 06:04:50,590
I already got the... I got to get in front of them. Shhh.

2497
06:04:50,590 --> 06:06:15,950
Starting now. Nothing was even fucking funny.

2498
06:06:15,950 --> 06:06:19,950
I just started rifling through things in my head that were funny.

2499
06:06:19,950 --> 06:06:24,639
I don't know why my brain was trying to make me lose.

2500
06:06:24,639 --> 06:06:28,639
You know when you're in class and the teacher's like, everybody shut the fuck up.

2501
06:06:28,639 --> 06:06:32,639
Anyone peeps at all and that's it. You're going to have detention.

2502
06:06:32,639 --> 06:06:36,639
And you shut the fuck up and you're like, I don't want to get in trouble. And then you think of every funny thing

2503
06:06:36,639 --> 06:06:40,639
you've ever heard of in your life. Your brain just starts to talk.

2504
06:06:40,639 --> 06:06:44,639
Things that have nothing to do with what you just heard. What might have been funny five minutes ago.

2505
06:06:44,639 --> 06:06:48,639
You fell off your skateboard and you bumped your head on a wall

2506
06:06:48,639 --> 06:06:52,939
or something in the ninth grade and it was like hilarious.

2507
06:06:52,939 --> 06:06:56,939
Like somebody puked in front of you when you were like fucking fourteen and you were like laughing your ass off.

2508
06:06:56,939 --> 06:07:08,479
Those images come into your mind. That just happened. I'm going to get it.

2509
06:07:08,479 --> 06:07:17,520
I'm going to get it. Let's go. Three, two, one, go.

2510
06:07:17,520 --> 06:07:22,650
What? No, I'm talking about like if I like... You ever like bumped into something and like you knocked over

2511
06:07:22,650 --> 06:07:49,080
like a fucking cabinet and it's not funny? Yeah, a whole cabinet.

2512
06:07:49,080 --> 06:07:53,959
I'm sorry guys, but in eighth grade typing class

2513
06:07:53,959 --> 06:07:58,459
somebody puking on their computer all over the keys. How would you react to that?

2514
06:07:58,459 --> 06:08:19,450
Like holy shit. But that didn't even happen to me.

2515
06:08:19,450 --> 06:08:25,869
That happened to my father. That's a story from my father.

2516
06:08:25,869 --> 06:08:29,869
My father did that. I wasn't in the classroom.

2517
06:08:29,869 --> 06:08:38,139
He ate like pecan pie and fucking threw up all over his computer.

2518
06:08:38,139 --> 06:08:42,139
Wait, this might have been a lie that my father told me.

2519
06:08:42,139 --> 06:08:46,139
Because they didn't have computers back then, did they?

2520
06:08:46,139 --> 06:08:55,360
Was it computers back in like the fucking 70s? He's going for it.

2521
06:08:55,360 --> 06:09:09,240
He's going for it. He's going for it. How bad is the picture that I took?

2522
06:09:09,240 --> 06:09:18,090
It doesn't matter. It looks like shit, but who cares? Yeah, there was a typing class.

2523
06:09:18,090 --> 06:09:22,090
I'm going to text him tomorrow and be like, hey, did you have a computer?

2524
06:09:22,090 --> 06:09:26,090
Did the pecan pie throw up all over the keyboard story real or did you make that up?

2525
06:09:26,090 --> 06:09:50,299
I'm going to get the whole story. I've been here for so long trying to take pictures of these fucking...

2526
06:09:50,299 --> 06:09:57,419
I was going to say elves. Every funny thing I've ever heard of is happening

2527
06:09:57,419 --> 06:10:01,419
right now in my brain. Everything that I've ever thought was funny

2528
06:10:01,419 --> 06:10:05,419
is all mashing together into one made-up fucking story.

2529
06:10:05,419 --> 06:10:21,049
I think that's actually what's happening because I can't shut the fuck up

2530
06:10:21,049 --> 06:10:39,290
for five minutes. Are you going for it? It's good practice. Okay, I'm going to try

2531
06:10:39,290 --> 06:10:43,290
it again. This is the real one. This one's no more fucking wrong. I swear to God. I promise.

2532
06:10:43,290 --> 06:10:47,290
100% guarantee. If I crack, I will give a hundred

2533
06:10:47,290 --> 06:10:51,790
gift subs if I fucking crack. Five minutes starting now. Let's go.

2534
06:10:51,790 --> 06:15:10,330
God damn it.

2535
06:15:10,330 --> 06:15:14,889
Okay, two things. One, the ostriches were walking in exact succession

2536
06:15:14,889 --> 06:15:20,409
into my lens. It got silent and y'all hear it was... and then I crashed the same

2537
06:15:20,409 --> 06:15:24,409
fucking bush that had crashed into like a hundred times.

2538
06:15:24,409 --> 06:15:38,299
How long was that? That's four minutes?

2539
06:15:38,299 --> 06:16:12,439
Photo finish. How many subs was it? Fifty?

2540
06:16:12,439 --> 06:16:44,750
Oh, God damn it.

2541
06:16:44,750 --> 06:16:48,750
I had it too. It was fine. I swallowed that bullshit and then I drove into the same

2542
06:16:48,750 --> 06:17:05,659
fucking bush I've driven into every single goddamn time. Alright, how do I fucking do this

2543
06:17:05,659 --> 06:17:11,880
again? God damn it. Is it a hundred subs?

2544
06:17:11,880 --> 06:17:15,880
The last time I did this was bingo, like four months ago.

2545
06:17:15,880 --> 06:17:25,369
This doesn't count as like money laundering, right? No, it doesn't count because I just

2546
06:17:25,369 --> 06:17:33,950
lose money. Let me get to the channel. Double or nothing? Double or

2547
06:17:33,950 --> 06:17:41,049
nothing. Two hundred gifted subs if I can't do it.

2548
06:17:41,049 --> 06:17:46,319
Two fucking hundred. Double

2549
06:17:46,319 --> 06:17:50,939
or nothing for ten minutes. No, it's never gonna happen.

2550
06:17:50,939 --> 06:17:55,310
That will never happen. I can guarantee that.

2551
06:17:55,310 --> 06:17:59,799
Oh, for ten minutes I can do it. Oh, God damn it.

2552
06:17:59,799 --> 06:18:07,930
No, I'm like, we're gonna giggly and laugh right now. It's not gonna work.

2553
06:18:07,930 --> 06:18:11,930
It should be five. Yeah, no, double or nothing. The time is the same. Ten minutes

2554
06:18:11,930 --> 06:18:17,840
is no way. I can't fucking close my mouth for ten minutes.

2555
06:18:17,840 --> 06:18:21,840
Like, in four minutes I put my hands up and I laugh at my fingers sometimes.

2556
06:18:21,840 --> 06:18:25,840
Like, you're not gonna work. I'm one of the fucking weasels from Who Framed Roger Rabbit.

2557
06:18:25,840 --> 06:18:32,119
It's not gonna happen. It's hard because I know I see chat like

2558
06:18:32,119 --> 06:18:36,119
over here in the corner of my eye. I'm not even paying attention to you guys. And all I see, I see,

2559
06:18:36,119 --> 06:18:40,119
I can feel what you guys are writing. Somebody wrote like fucking

2560
06:18:40,119 --> 06:18:44,119
brap. And I don't think that's funny. And like, I fucking

2561
06:18:44,119 --> 06:18:48,119
just like, I can feel that word. And it's just like

2562
06:18:48,119 --> 06:18:55,819
fuck, I turn off the monitor. Alright, here we go.

2563
06:18:55,819 --> 06:18:59,819
Double or nothing. Five, same time. Five minutes, two hundred gifted subs

2564
06:18:59,819 --> 06:19:03,819
if I don't fucking do it. I'm getting ready for this one. I'm gonna think about like fucking just

2565
06:19:03,819 --> 06:19:08,000
I'm gonna think about like, you know what I'm gonna think about? I'm gonna think about like fucking bad,

2566
06:19:08,000 --> 06:19:14,909
mean stuff. This is that crying fucking

2567
06:19:14,909 --> 06:19:18,909
face. I'm just gonna make sure that I don't do anything fucking, I gotta get it out

2568
06:19:18,909 --> 06:19:24,360
of me. I'm just gonna put a picture of something, no, because I think it's funny after like a minute or

2569
06:19:24,360 --> 06:19:28,360
two. I snap a mirror cap, I gotta get that off the screen. I gotta get you guys off the screen.

2570
06:19:28,360 --> 06:19:34,779
Alright, two hundred gifted subs if I don't do this in another five minutes. But

2571
06:19:34,779 --> 06:19:38,779
hold on, I gotta think of everything that's ever funny right now and I gotta laugh about it.

2572
06:19:38,779 --> 06:19:47,369
Alright, here we go. Five minutes, double or nothing, two hundred subs if I don't

2573
06:19:47,369 --> 06:19:55,240
get it, I'm already gonna fucking up. Alright, we gotta get an official

2574
06:19:55,240 --> 06:19:59,240
time. I can see it at the timer right here. We're at six, twenty, twenty

2575
06:19:59,240 --> 06:20:03,240
seven. So at the top of the minute here, at six hours and twenty one minutes

2576
06:20:03,240 --> 06:20:07,240
screen, but that's where it begins. No talking, no bursts,

2577
06:20:07,240 --> 06:20:12,000
just, I'm turning the fucking screen off. I don't even see you guys.

2578
06:20:12,000 --> 06:20:18,119
No, that's cheating. Here we go. The minute's about

2579
06:20:18,119 --> 06:20:22,680
to turn here. Somebody, okay, I'm not looking to fucking chat ever again.

2580
06:20:22,680 --> 06:20:30,240
Here it comes, three,

2581
06:20:30,240 --> 06:20:55,520
two, triple or nothing, triple

2582
06:20:55,520 --> 06:21:01,419
or nothing, three hundred, three hundred if I can't do it.

2583
06:21:01,419 --> 06:21:05,790
Triple or nothing on the table. I can't have you guys here.

2584
06:21:05,790 --> 06:21:09,790
I see like fucking faces over here. I know you guys are fucking with me.

2585
06:21:09,790 --> 06:21:14,720
Triple or nothing, three hundred gifted subs if I don't get it, five minutes.

2586
06:21:14,720 --> 06:21:24,240
Triple or nothing, ready?

2587
06:21:24,240 --> 06:31:03,680
Five minutes, triple or nothing. I told you I could fucking do it.

2588
06:31:03,680 --> 06:31:08,240
I said to bring five grand to the casino and put a thousand dollars

2589
06:31:08,240 --> 06:31:12,240
in and lose it in one hand, put two thousand and lose it, and then put

2590
06:31:12,240 --> 06:31:16,240
three thousand, two thousand and then win. No, you bring five

2591
06:31:16,240 --> 06:31:20,240
thousand dollars to the casino, put a five hundred dollar hand on blackjack, you lose it.

2592
06:31:20,240 --> 06:31:24,479
Two thousand dollar hand on blackjack, you lose it. Fucking another

2593
06:31:24,479 --> 06:31:33,180
twenty-five hundred hand on blackjack, you hit it, get out, go home. Did I get the photo?

2594
06:31:33,180 --> 06:31:41,959
I got the photo, let's get out of here. Quadruple or nothing, I already did it.

2595
06:31:41,959 --> 06:31:51,950
What would that, that would have been, that would have been what, like

2596
06:31:51,950 --> 06:31:56,250
fucking fifteen hundred dollars spent with what, three hundred subs.

2597
06:31:56,250 --> 06:32:03,479
So, if it's like two grand,

2598
06:32:03,479 --> 06:32:15,180
holy fuck, fifteen hundred.

2599
06:32:15,180 --> 06:32:21,919
What the hell are we even doing on this stream anymore? Is it time to go?

2600
06:32:21,919 --> 06:32:36,970
Well, it is off the camera, that's for sure. No, you should have, the people that were saying double or nothing

2601
06:32:36,970 --> 06:32:47,720
should have just let me sleep in my bed. Let's give them the photo.

2602
06:32:47,720 --> 06:33:01,159
What's wrong with the controller? Nobody said triple or nothing, yeah, but I was

2603
06:33:01,159 --> 06:33:10,639
panicking. This is the best one.

2604
06:33:10,639 --> 06:33:15,319
We don't want you to lose money. It's alright.

2605
06:33:15,319 --> 06:33:24,159
Cute animal request. I gained viewers doing that.

2606
06:33:24,159 --> 06:33:31,529
There were like twenty-seven hundred people here when I started doing that.

2607
06:33:31,529 --> 06:33:36,729
And now there's like thirty-two hundred. If you lost triple or nothing, would you have done quadruple?

2608
06:33:36,729 --> 06:33:46,650
No, that's strike three. That's to be standing?

2609
06:33:46,650 --> 06:33:53,319
Oh, fuck, it does. Triple or nothing, cause that is strike four, you can't go strike

2610
06:33:53,319 --> 06:34:12,400
four. That's not how that works. Technically standing.

2611
06:34:12,400 --> 06:34:16,400
People logged on their Smurf Twitch account to get the free sub.

2612
06:34:20,169 --> 06:34:26,319
Quadruple or nothing? No, man.

2613
06:34:26,319 --> 06:34:31,240
No way. After triple or nothing, that's it.

2614
06:34:31,240 --> 06:34:35,240
I broke even at the casino and my heart is

2615
06:34:35,240 --> 06:34:39,240
in my fucking stomach and I'm slowly going to walk out of the casino and be like

2616
06:34:39,240 --> 06:34:53,770
holy fuck, I'm never doing that again.

2617
06:34:53,770 --> 06:34:58,400
Two thousand dollar joke. Well, yeah, technically I would be

2618
06:34:58,400 --> 06:35:02,400
paying, I would just be giving Twitch money. Like I would just be giving the money.

2619
06:35:02,400 --> 06:35:09,580
I did that before. How about just for fun?

2620
06:35:09,580 --> 06:35:27,840
Let me save the game first. Then I would inflate my

2621
06:35:27,840 --> 06:35:33,290
sub count and then in a month it would come back down.

2622
06:35:33,290 --> 06:35:40,479
People are leaving. It's alright, we're getting to the end anyways.

2623
06:35:40,479 --> 06:35:44,650
In fact, we're probably going to call pretty soon here. It's been about

2624
06:35:44,650 --> 06:36:08,650
seven hours. Logging out of their Smurfs.

2625
06:36:08,650 --> 06:36:13,919
You're going to play a stunt like that and then go? I would have done it.

2626
06:36:13,919 --> 06:36:34,409
If I had lost on that third time, I would have done it.

2627
06:36:34,409 --> 06:36:41,849
A stunt like five minutes of silence.

2628
06:37:01,000 --> 06:37:22,759
Alright, where are we going? Let me just take a pee break. I'll be right back.

2629
06:37:22,759 --> 06:39:27,069
Let me just take a quick piss break. Alright, guys.

2630
06:39:27,069 --> 06:39:31,439
I guess it's going to happen. I'm going to give you a consolation prize. 50 community subs

2631
06:39:31,439 --> 06:39:52,889
coming out right now. Psych? No, there they come.

2632
06:39:52,889 --> 06:40:08,319
Generous streamer says, you know what, to the casino. Take my money anyway.

2633
06:40:08,319 --> 06:40:20,909
Congratulations, whoever gets it. I'm going to change my monitor here. Hey, hey, thanks a lot

2634
06:40:20,909 --> 06:40:35,319
German985. He's pretending. That's not pretending.

2635
06:40:35,319 --> 06:40:48,009
What the fuck? Holy shit! 50 community subs!

2636
06:40:48,009 --> 06:41:01,840
You know, I bet too much money. I bet too much.

2637
06:41:01,840 --> 06:41:07,159
And it's all good, because half of that money doesn't even come back.

2638
06:41:07,159 --> 06:41:19,959
That was fun. You guys got the house edge.

2639
06:41:19,959 --> 06:41:23,959
Even if you played a casino, if I was putting three grand

2640
06:41:23,959 --> 06:41:28,200
on the line there, even if I didn't lose,

2641
06:41:28,200 --> 06:41:32,200
even if you played blackjack perfectly, that's still a one or two percent house edge.

2642
06:41:32,200 --> 06:41:39,319
You know? Egotistic streamer

2643
06:41:39,319 --> 06:41:44,139
donates money to himself and demands thanks for it.

2644
06:41:44,139 --> 06:41:54,569
And I think with

2645
06:41:54,569 --> 06:41:58,569
that, I think I'm going to call it there. I think that's a good enough to go

2646
06:41:58,569 --> 06:42:02,880
out on. Did about seven hours. Gonna take us about an hour to go through the bits.

2647
06:42:02,880 --> 06:42:06,880
Oh my fucking god. Wait, wait, why did you match me? No, you just gave

2648
06:42:06,880 --> 06:42:10,880
the money back. No, you gave me, you gave the house, the casino just gave me the

2649
06:42:10,880 --> 06:42:18,119
house edge back. You weren't supposed to match me.

2650
06:42:18,119 --> 06:42:22,119
Well, there it is. There's your 100 community subs, guys, from me failing it the first time.

2651
06:42:22,119 --> 06:42:29,799
There you go. That first failure when I said 100,

2652
06:42:29,799 --> 06:42:33,799
there it is. I decided to get matched by ha ha ha ha.

2653
06:42:33,799 --> 06:42:40,590
Kumo, Chi Chi, thank you for the 50

2654
06:42:40,590 --> 06:42:49,310
matched community subs to make it a hummy. The promise was

2655
06:42:49,310 --> 06:42:53,310
delivered, if it wasn't me, completely. Only two, and that's not true, only

2656
06:42:53,310 --> 06:43:09,119
200 more to go. No, that's 100. Yeah, that was a lot of fun.

2657
06:43:09,119 --> 06:43:13,119
We're gonna take off here now. That's a good time. That's a good note to close it out on.

2658
06:43:13,119 --> 06:43:17,479
That was an interesting thing to close it out on. That was Africa.

2659
06:43:17,479 --> 06:43:22,029
It was a fun game. Relaxing.

2660
06:43:22,029 --> 06:43:26,029
Hard to keep a straight face when you silently sit in there.

2661
06:43:26,029 --> 06:43:31,479
And so the plan for the next couple days is

2662
06:43:31,479 --> 06:43:35,849
I really have to play this by ear. Cause I really don't know what the scenario is

2663
06:43:35,849 --> 06:43:40,159
gonna be, cause like I said, when Italics and I are both trying to

2664
06:43:40,159 --> 06:43:44,159
stream at the same time, or try to use the internet at the same time, sometimes

2665
06:43:44,159 --> 06:43:48,159
it just fucking kills the whole thing. So it seems to be

2666
06:43:48,159 --> 06:43:52,159
fixed though, at least in a packet loss frame drop kind of way.

2667
06:43:52,159 --> 06:43:56,159
But we might have another issue entirely.

2668
06:43:56,159 --> 06:44:00,159
So tomorrow, I plan on streaming Vive tomorrow, but just

2669
06:44:00,159 --> 06:44:04,330
stay, stay alert! Cause around

2670
06:44:04,330 --> 06:44:08,330
the stream time tomorrow, around like 2 to 3 PM,

2671
06:44:08,330 --> 06:44:12,330
I'm gonna be around to give you guys an update on what's actually happening.

2672
06:44:12,330 --> 06:44:16,330
Who knows, this might just be a random fluke of a day.

2673
06:44:16,330 --> 06:44:21,069
Oh, B or B, that's not true. This might be like a random day

2674
06:44:21,069 --> 06:44:25,069
that's a fluke, where I get a green light for like 7 hours for no reason.

2675
06:44:25,069 --> 06:44:32,319
But, I'll see you maybe tomorrow?

2676
06:44:32,319 --> 06:44:38,270
I don't know. We'll find out.

2677
06:44:38,270 --> 06:44:42,270
Thanks for joining me ahead. That was a lot of fun. That was a fun, relaxing,

2678
06:44:42,270 --> 06:44:48,619
chill hangout stream. Thank you for the massive amount of

2679
06:44:48,619 --> 06:44:52,619
community subs, especially right at the end there from Ha Ha Ha.

2680
06:44:52,619 --> 06:45:01,389
Much love to you all. I'll see you all maybe tomorrow. I'll let you guys know

2681
06:45:01,389 --> 06:45:08,319
either on Twitter or here. And with that, let's do the bits. What do you say?

2682
06:45:08,319 --> 06:45:21,950
Let's pull it up here. Did I look into the OpenVR plugin?

2683
06:45:21,950 --> 06:45:26,509
Yeah, I have this OpenVR. There's a couple of other things. There's like a chat. I can do

2684
06:45:26,509 --> 06:45:30,509
chat, right? If I get a certain thing, I have chat on my hand. I've been looking

2685
06:45:30,509 --> 06:45:38,569
into a lot of them. Let's scroll back down to earlier this evening.

2686
06:45:38,569 --> 06:45:42,569
To 7 hours ago now. Just about 7-ish hours ago.

2687
06:45:42,569 --> 06:45:48,840
Yeah, OVR drop. Yeah. I'm going to try to get it set up.

2688
06:45:48,840 --> 06:45:52,840
The whole room is set up, so really it's just software stuff that I can do tonight and tomorrow.

2689
06:45:52,840 --> 06:45:59,389
But thank you Rise, Fall of Ziggy.

2690
06:45:59,389 --> 06:46:03,389
Thank you for the $5. Ziggy Stardust is the name.

2691
06:46:03,389 --> 06:46:07,389
This stream exists. Congratulations. Yeah. Yeah, for a like,

2692
06:46:07,389 --> 06:46:11,389
let's test the internet stream. I had a lot of fun. Hope you guys did too.

2693
06:46:11,389 --> 06:46:16,139
Timmy Tim Tim, thanks for the $1 play. Crazy Strike Bowling for a Nintendo

2694
06:46:16,139 --> 06:46:23,389
Switch. I gotta use my Switch more. I

2695
06:46:23,389 --> 06:46:27,630
started off doing a ton of Switch stuff. I haven't done it in such a long time.

2696
06:46:27,630 --> 06:46:32,439
It's been at least a couple months since I've even turned it on. But thank you Timmy Tim Tim.

2697
06:46:32,439 --> 06:46:36,680
Jared Roberts, thanks for the $15. Thanks for streaming

2698
06:46:36,680 --> 06:46:41,759
German Life is Difficult and Simple Streams can brighten it up.

2699
06:46:41,759 --> 06:46:47,580
Thank you so much for the $15. And yeah, it's

2700
06:46:47,580 --> 06:46:53,099
sometimes the little things are worth looking forward to.

2701
06:46:53,099 --> 06:46:58,840
Like taking photos of animals in Africa on the PlayStation 3.

2702
06:46:58,840 --> 06:47:05,240
But thank you so much for

2703
06:47:05,240 --> 06:47:10,319
the $15 Brad Roberts. Divus, thanks for the $2 Divus.

2704
06:47:10,319 --> 06:47:17,630
No message is Divus coming in always with a few dollars every stream. Thank you.

2705
06:47:17,630 --> 06:47:22,189
Dark Keegan, thanks for the $10.

2706
06:47:22,189 --> 06:47:26,189
Finally managed to catch a stream after starting my first job. Thanks for all the laughs. You're great.

2707
06:47:26,189 --> 06:47:31,880
Thank you. Thank you for the $10 and thank you for sticking around.

2708
06:47:31,880 --> 06:47:38,459
Glad you got to catch one. Maybe we'll see you again soon.

2709
06:47:38,459 --> 06:47:42,459
Mostly Lost, thanks for the $10. No, that's a $1 for Mostly Lost.

2710
06:47:42,459 --> 06:47:46,459
The game should work fine if you delete the streamer. That was 7 hours ago

2711
06:47:46,459 --> 06:47:50,700
and then somehow we came back to that 7 hours later.

2712
06:47:50,700 --> 06:47:57,229
Well, nice foreshadowing. We had 50

2713
06:47:57,229 --> 06:48:04,029
community subs from Great Canadian Fuck Club, right?

2714
06:48:04,029 --> 06:48:09,040
And then WhiffWiff gave a bunch to, there pretty much

2715
06:48:09,040 --> 06:48:13,040
was 200 or 300 community subs tonight. Just combined.

2716
06:48:13,040 --> 06:48:18,750
So double enough and triple enough and don't really matter. Thank you to both of you.

2717
06:48:18,750 --> 06:48:27,520
Mostly Lost also gave $50. I think I somehow

2718
06:48:27,520 --> 06:48:34,430
missed this. If you still hear Mostly Lost, thank you so much for your

2719
06:48:34,430 --> 06:48:41,740
large amount of money. Finally my missed bits.

2720
06:48:41,740 --> 06:48:47,130
I'm so sorry. What was I doing here? I don't know.

2721
06:48:47,130 --> 06:48:51,130
But thanks a lot, man. They say, here I assume this is what you paid for the game, so let me

2722
06:48:51,130 --> 06:48:56,650
reimburse you for it. Oh wait. The game was

2723
06:48:56,650 --> 06:49:00,650
just about, I think it was $50 total. Like $48 or something.

2724
06:49:00,650 --> 06:49:06,409
But thank you. German95, thanks for donating, dude.

2725
06:49:06,409 --> 06:49:14,880
What do I have for a sub count now? I have

2726
06:49:14,880 --> 06:49:19,819
over $5,800. It was almost $7,000

2727
06:49:19,819 --> 06:49:23,819
something, I think. I think it was just under $7,000. Was it $7,200

2728
06:49:23,819 --> 06:49:27,819
or something before? Like with the insane amount of community subs?

2729
06:49:27,819 --> 06:49:36,090
Yeah. There was like, I had over, was it over

2730
06:49:36,090 --> 06:49:40,720
$7,000 or was it up to, it's like $68 or something.

2731
06:49:40,720 --> 06:49:46,680
But we're at about $58. I think some of you guys, yeah $65.

2732
06:49:46,680 --> 06:49:50,680
There were so many community subs last month. It was ridiculous.

2733
06:49:50,680 --> 06:50:04,889
But thanks a lot, Mostly Lost. How do you handle the fluctuating

2734
06:50:04,889 --> 06:50:09,840
income as a streamer? Do you just live well below your income at any time?

2735
06:50:09,840 --> 06:50:15,229
Yeah, I mean, I just, I mean, for the most part

2736
06:50:15,229 --> 06:50:22,220
I think that as long as, like look, if you're paying your bills

2737
06:50:22,220 --> 06:50:26,220
and you pay for, you know, food and bills and

2738
06:50:26,220 --> 06:50:30,909
just because you're making, like I'm making

2739
06:50:30,909 --> 06:50:36,040
very, very good money from you guys. It's fucking insane.

2740
06:50:36,040 --> 06:50:42,400
But, I mean, living below your means, I mean,

2741
06:50:42,400 --> 06:50:46,400
five, six, seven, eight thousand subscriptions on Twitch. You talk, that's a ton

2742
06:50:46,400 --> 06:50:52,279
of money. So I just, you know, want to save

2743
06:50:52,279 --> 06:50:56,459
some money. I want to put a lot of money back into the stream, which is what I

2744
06:50:56,459 --> 06:51:00,459
try to do. I mean, I spend

2745
06:51:00,459 --> 06:51:05,340
a significant percentage of every dollar that I make from Twitch goes

2746
06:51:05,340 --> 06:51:09,340
back to, you know, studio shit and buying games and buying systems

2747
06:51:09,340 --> 06:51:18,439
and hiring people and so

2748
06:51:18,439 --> 06:51:22,680
I'd like to, because then there's another, I mean, obviously there's the realistic approach

2749
06:51:22,680 --> 06:51:27,180
too, right? Where, you know, if you make a really good amount of money

2750
06:51:27,180 --> 06:51:31,360
doing something like this, because it's such a

2751
06:51:31,360 --> 06:51:35,849
kind of volatile place, you know, like streaming and YouTube,

2752
06:51:35,849 --> 06:51:39,849
it's not like, oh, this is the amount of money that you're going to make and you're going to make that probably for

2753
06:51:39,849 --> 06:51:43,849
like five to ten years and maybe you could get a promotion, maybe that's the money you're going to make

2754
06:51:43,849 --> 06:51:48,860
for like two decades. Like, I have no idea. You know, there's really no way

2755
06:51:48,860 --> 06:51:52,860
to tell. So why not just try to

2756
06:51:52,860 --> 06:51:56,860
do what I can and save what I can and make as good of a stream

2757
06:51:56,860 --> 06:52:06,860
as I can while I'm here. But I'm along for the ride, however

2758
06:52:06,860 --> 06:52:12,639
long it takes. You know, wherever this train leads to, I'm

2759
06:52:12,639 --> 06:52:18,220
going to ride it. Let's just get on it, right? Like you might even go

2760
06:52:18,220 --> 06:52:23,419
way up in a couple months and then just drop off. No, yeah, it can. It can.

2761
06:52:23,419 --> 06:52:31,439
But I've been showered with such generosity

2762
06:52:31,439 --> 06:52:37,759
over the last year that I'm

2763
06:52:37,759 --> 06:52:42,639
I'm living well in my means. So thank you all for the

2764
06:52:42,639 --> 06:52:50,509
support for real. But hopefully that answers the question.

2765
06:52:50,509 --> 06:52:54,509
And let's go to... Kairatobi gave a shitload of community subs.

2766
06:52:54,509 --> 06:52:59,840
Winterly Parsley gave a bunch of community subs. It was like

2767
06:52:59,840 --> 06:53:13,020
fucking two or three hundred. That was a lot. A lot, a lot, a lot.

2768
06:53:13,020 --> 06:53:17,020
And then we had Lobotomized Teddy Bear gave a dollar. Jerma, I'm happy you're teaching chat about

2769
06:53:17,020 --> 06:53:21,020
African animals before they are all basically

2770
06:53:21,020 --> 06:53:25,020
dead in like 20 years. That's so morbid.

2771
06:53:25,020 --> 06:53:35,500
This is not... Oh, God.

2772
06:53:35,500 --> 06:53:44,349
Well, I hope you liked the elephant. Somebody mentioned about taxes. Yeah, I mean

2773
06:53:44,349 --> 06:53:48,349
there's taxes on every dollar that I make from Twitch.

2774
06:53:48,349 --> 06:53:54,750
You know, it's not just like, oh, this is the amount

2775
06:53:54,750 --> 06:53:58,750
of money you make from a sub and that's yours. You get to keep. No, there's taxes.

2776
06:53:58,750 --> 06:54:04,270
It's hard to do taxes when you just sort of completely

2777
06:54:04,270 --> 06:54:08,270
have 1099 as income is what it's called. So it can get like sloppy

2778
06:54:08,270 --> 06:54:14,110
if you don't stay on top of it. But I've been doing just fine.

2779
06:54:14,110 --> 06:54:27,869
I have a good tax person. I talk to them all the time. As long as you stay

2780
06:54:27,869 --> 06:54:34,650
on top of it. Tax boy. But thank you Lobotomized Teddy Bear.

2781
06:54:34,650 --> 06:54:38,650
A Louis, thanks for the one dollar, or Louis with a large underscore.

2782
06:54:38,650 --> 06:54:43,599
Thank you. People possum thanks for the five bucks.

2783
06:54:43,599 --> 06:54:47,599
They say forehead. Hey Jerma, I'm donating blood on Monday and they're

2784
06:54:47,599 --> 06:54:51,770
replacing it all with pee. I'm very excited.

2785
06:54:51,770 --> 06:54:55,770
Well, unfortunately, I don't know if that's a great idea.

2786
06:54:55,770 --> 06:55:01,930
Why would they replace your blood with pee? Well, if the first part

2787
06:55:01,930 --> 06:55:05,930
is true, that's really, really kind of you and good of you to do.

2788
06:55:05,930 --> 06:55:11,900
Hopefully it goes to somebody that really needs it. So thank you for doing that if that's true.

2789
06:55:11,900 --> 06:55:16,400
For the pee part, I would probably not sign

2790
06:55:16,400 --> 06:55:21,150
that waiver. I'm not sure you should do that.

2791
06:55:21,150 --> 06:55:25,639
But thank you. Thank you Tar Alacrin for the one dollar. Hey Jerma, great gameplay today. Really

2792
06:55:25,639 --> 06:55:29,950
riveting. And they do a sarcastic I'm smiling face.

2793
06:55:29,950 --> 06:55:33,950
Anyways, have you considered playing one of those new fangled

2794
06:55:33,950 --> 06:55:37,950
randomizers like a Zelda game? That are all the rage these days.

2795
06:55:37,950 --> 06:55:41,950
If you are worried about getting lost, I don't think it would be distinguishable from you playing a game normally.

2796
06:55:41,950 --> 06:55:49,819
Hopefully we see a couple of ehe's from that one.

2797
06:55:49,819 --> 06:55:55,080
Randomize the stuff though. Once I'm done with everything else

2798
06:55:55,080 --> 06:56:00,009
that I want to do. There's a bunch of shit that I want to do.

2799
06:56:00,009 --> 06:56:04,009
I bought a bunch of PlayStation 2 games. I've got to

2800
06:56:04,009 --> 06:56:08,830
admit it to you guys. I just went on a PlayStation 2 spree

2801
06:56:08,830 --> 06:56:12,830
again. I bought like 10 more. Already on top of the fucking

2802
06:56:12,830 --> 06:56:18,799
10 that is still there to be played. So we're going to have to do another

2803
06:56:18,799 --> 06:56:22,799
PlayStation 2. I got the Jaws game where you play as the shark.

2804
06:56:22,799 --> 06:56:33,799
I just had to buy it. I had to get it.

2805
06:56:33,799 --> 06:56:39,580
The game is great. I know. There's a lot to do.

2806
06:56:39,580 --> 06:56:44,590
Thank you Binary Man for the $5.11. Sorry Jerma,

2807
06:56:44,590 --> 06:56:48,590
but I had to. To anyone who can actually play this properly, I apologize

2808
06:56:48,590 --> 06:56:52,590
for the bad playing, but I learned it on the spot while waiting for the

2809
06:56:52,590 --> 06:57:02,000
stream to start. Well, what is it?

2810
06:57:02,000 --> 06:57:17,419
It's a YouTube link. Stream in the corner.

2811
06:57:17,419 --> 06:57:36,560
That's it. That's the whole thing.

2812
06:57:36,560 --> 06:57:46,939
Thank you so much. That sounded pretty great.

2813
06:57:46,939 --> 06:57:54,729
Thank you Binary Man. Thank you Dork Cube for the $1.

2814
06:57:54,729 --> 06:57:58,729
Firefox and Twitch don't mix too well, so when I went to look at the emotes

2815
06:57:58,729 --> 06:58:02,729
and saw that you had what looked like 50 emotes that were all duplicates, I was

2816
06:58:02,729 --> 06:58:16,409
confused. What the fuck? That's a weird bug.

2817
06:58:16,409 --> 06:58:27,479
That's a very strange bug. That's a lot of emotes.

2818
06:58:27,479 --> 06:58:31,479
Thank you Dork Cube for the $1. Hey Flank Tank, thanks for the $10.

2819
06:58:31,479 --> 06:58:35,479
$10 from Flank Tank. Hey, I heard from a little safari birdie

2820
06:58:35,479 --> 06:58:39,479
that on February 26, Nier Automata was releasing its own

2821
06:58:39,479 --> 06:58:43,479
prepared to die Scholar of the First Sin version with all the DLC for I think half off.

2822
06:58:43,479 --> 06:58:47,479
Not sure what the other changes will be, but that might be a good time to look into it.

2823
06:58:47,479 --> 06:58:54,720
Jerma Venus. Sure.

2824
06:58:54,720 --> 06:59:02,729
I've never played it. I never played the other one. There's like a series, right?

2825
06:59:02,729 --> 06:59:09,529
There's like Nier, then there's Nier Automata.

2826
06:59:09,529 --> 06:59:16,459
I don't know really anything about them. All I know is that they exist.

2827
06:59:16,459 --> 06:59:20,459
But thank you for the suggestion. I did not know that was coming out. I will definitely

2828
06:59:20,459 --> 06:59:25,770
be looking into it. Thank you for the $10. Hey Swiggity Swanky, thanks for the $3.

2829
06:59:25,770 --> 06:59:33,130
This is your situation with cocks right now.

2830
06:59:33,130 --> 06:59:37,819
There are discs all over me. There are discs in every single part of my life right now.

2831
06:59:37,819 --> 06:59:41,819
There's a disc over here. There's a disc over here. I got discs in front of me.

2832
06:59:41,819 --> 06:59:46,759
I got discs all over me. Covered in discs.

2833
06:59:46,759 --> 06:59:51,630
He knew what he was doing.

2834
06:59:51,630 --> 06:59:55,630
He knew what he was doing there, making a joke. Don't let him fool you.

2835
06:59:55,630 --> 07:00:05,630
That's got at least 22 thumbs up on the

2836
07:00:05,630 --> 07:00:09,630
comments section. He knows what he's doing, guys.

2837
07:00:09,630 --> 07:00:22,560
But thank you Swiggity Swanky for the $3. Super sale thanks

2838
07:00:22,560 --> 07:00:26,560
for the $1. If a hippo woke you up in the middle of the night and personally asked you to pee

2839
07:00:26,560 --> 07:00:30,560
in their urinal mouth. Why are you asking me this?

2840
07:00:30,560 --> 07:00:35,799
The answer is no. I would call the police.

2841
07:00:35,799 --> 07:00:39,799
Jess, you got it. Thanks for the $1. After two weeks, I managed to finish editing that video

2842
07:00:39,799 --> 07:00:44,490
of all the sounds you made in January. And then it broke in rendering and I couldn't

2843
07:00:44,490 --> 07:00:48,490
save it. I'm disappointed because it was pretty funny and I don't want to start over

2844
07:00:48,490 --> 07:00:52,490
so here is one of my favorites from the list of 300.

2845
07:00:52,490 --> 07:00:57,500
I'm so sorry to hear that. That sucks.

2846
07:00:57,500 --> 07:01:09,080
Oh, that's Simpsons Hit and Run. I remember that. That's from the Simpsons Hit and Run.

2847
07:01:09,080 --> 07:01:16,959
Adam Sandler. The TIE fighter.

2848
07:01:23,869 --> 07:01:29,500
I'm really sorry to hear about that though. That's happened to me

2849
07:01:29,500 --> 07:01:33,500
quite a few times. Where in Premiere

2850
07:01:33,500 --> 07:01:37,500
you're working on something for like three days and then all of a sudden it fucks up and the

2851
07:01:37,500 --> 07:01:41,500
save doesn't work. Or like you spend three hours on something and then you

2852
07:01:41,500 --> 07:01:45,500
lose the three hours of it. You go back and you're like what the fuck. I don't even want to

2853
07:01:45,500 --> 07:01:49,500
do this again. And then you try to get more re-motivated to do the same cuts

2854
07:01:49,500 --> 07:01:53,500
the same edits that you just did already. It's awful.

2855
07:01:53,500 --> 07:01:58,299
So I'm really sorry to hear that happen. But thank you for the

2856
07:01:58,299 --> 07:02:07,209
attempt and thank you for the clip. And thank you C4G for the $4.83

2857
07:02:07,209 --> 07:02:11,209
and they say pride. Hey you

2858
07:02:11,209 --> 07:02:15,209
fucking gamer. And they say pride. Hey, thank you.

2859
07:02:15,209 --> 07:02:20,520
For the $4.83. C4G. I'd like to call myself

2860
07:02:20,520 --> 07:02:25,400
a gamer sometime. Hey future gamers. Thanks for the $1.00. How much

2861
07:02:25,400 --> 07:02:29,400
have you used the Vive already? Have you not even put it on yet? I have not

2862
07:02:29,400 --> 07:02:34,479
logged into any Vive related games.

2863
07:02:34,479 --> 07:02:38,479
I have done the setup. So I painted the room

2864
07:02:38,479 --> 07:02:42,479
with the hand. Like I did the perimeter. I got everything ready to go.

2865
07:02:42,479 --> 07:02:46,970
So I've not played a game in it yet. Because I want

2866
07:02:46,970 --> 07:02:53,950
my first experience to happen on stream. So it does

2867
07:02:53,950 --> 07:02:57,950
fit. It does work. It's just a question of getting into a game, capturing it

2868
07:02:57,950 --> 07:03:05,959
and streaming it. And we will see how that happens tomorrow.

2869
07:03:05,959 --> 07:03:09,959
Again, like I don't want to be this guy that sits here and tells you

2870
07:03:09,959 --> 07:03:13,959
there might be a stream tomorrow. But there might not. But there might be a stream. But there may be not a

2871
07:03:13,959 --> 07:03:18,520
stream tomorrow. That's unfortunately the way I have to look at it right now.

2872
07:03:18,520 --> 07:03:22,520
Until this is confirmed, which it hasn't been. The technician I'm

2873
07:03:22,520 --> 07:03:26,520
working with has not closed the ticket yet.

2874
07:03:26,520 --> 07:03:31,279
So until that ticket is closed and yes that issue

2875
07:03:31,279 --> 07:03:35,279
is resolved, I can't tell you that I can

2876
07:03:35,279 --> 07:03:39,279
that there's going to be a stream tomorrow. I don't know. Because like again,

2877
07:03:39,279 --> 07:03:43,279
Italic streams from this location too. So we

2878
07:03:43,279 --> 07:03:49,180
have to both use it. So I'm sorry to say

2879
07:03:49,180 --> 07:03:53,180
that I wish I could tell you it was going to happen. But I don't know. We might have to wait until the day.

2880
07:03:53,180 --> 07:03:59,529
We'll see. I'm optimistic. At least he kept the ticket open.

2881
07:03:59,529 --> 07:04:03,529
Yeah, he's going to keep it open until it's like completely confirmed

2882
07:04:03,529 --> 07:04:08,990
that it is done and closed. Future gamer, thanks for the $1.

2883
07:04:08,990 --> 07:04:12,990
Again, I cannot wait to watch you WWE chair shot someone

2884
07:04:12,990 --> 07:04:17,799
in Blade and Sorcery. I don't know what that means, but I'm

2885
07:04:17,799 --> 07:04:25,099
looking forward to it. Whatever that is. Thank you Jamona Cucumber

2886
07:04:25,099 --> 07:04:29,400
for the $2. Hey Jerma, I don't know if you remember when I made the LEGO Glue Man

2887
07:04:29,400 --> 07:04:33,400
render. Well I made a Sneak Man render that I posted in Creative and it was a bit

2888
07:04:33,400 --> 07:04:37,400
shit. So I came back and took a running leap at it. I present Mr.

2889
07:04:37,400 --> 07:04:48,110
LEGO Sneak Man Remastered. LEGO Sneak Man!

2890
07:04:48,110 --> 07:04:58,090
He's got these like ripped abs. LEGO really,

2891
07:04:58,090 --> 07:05:06,029
LEGO is one of those things that will always be a thing.

2892
07:05:06,029 --> 07:05:10,029
The test of time has passed over LEGOs and they are still

2893
07:05:10,029 --> 07:05:14,029
just as popular and still just as relevant as they were

2894
07:05:14,029 --> 07:05:28,560
20-30 years ago. It will always be relevant.

2895
07:05:28,560 --> 07:05:33,369
Thank you Jamona Cucumber, it's a great render. The Glue Man one was great as well.

2896
07:05:33,369 --> 07:05:39,470
And they got a comparison. They say hey if you want a comparison, here are the two comparisons.

2897
07:05:39,470 --> 07:05:50,599
Let's take a look. The second one is a little cleaner.

2898
07:05:50,599 --> 07:05:59,880
There's some better shading on the second one. Looks good.

2899
07:05:59,880 --> 07:06:05,599
Thank you for that. Are the LEGO movies

2900
07:06:05,599 --> 07:06:11,950
really good? Aren't they really highly rated movies? Like LEGO

2901
07:06:11,950 --> 07:06:15,950
Batman and LEGO Island. Not LEGO Island, LEGO World.

2902
07:06:15,950 --> 07:06:19,950
What was the LEGO movie? That had like a 98% on Rotten Tomatoes or

2903
07:06:19,950 --> 07:06:26,479
something. So I mean they're doing just fine. Thank you

2904
07:06:26,479 --> 07:06:30,479
Yes Is Online for the one dollar my face win and I realize that all elephants are clay.

2905
07:06:30,479 --> 07:06:46,560
What does your face do? What the fuck?

2906
07:06:46,560 --> 07:06:55,529
This is an Alex Jones and Death Grips

2907
07:06:55,529 --> 07:07:16,009
mashup. That's what this is. Link it, link, link.

2908
07:07:16,009 --> 07:07:25,360
Here, here, here, I'm giving it to you.

2909
07:07:25,360 --> 07:07:29,529
Thank you for that. Yes Is Online. My face win, all elephants are clay.

2910
07:07:29,529 --> 07:07:35,119
Freudian Weapon thanks for the eleven dollars. I could honestly write an essay about how inspirational

2911
07:07:35,119 --> 07:07:41,709
you've been to me. Thank you for the eleven dollars and I

2912
07:07:41,709 --> 07:07:45,709
can't believe that somebody would say something like that. So thank you so much.

2913
07:07:45,709 --> 07:07:49,709
I'm happy that you can find any inspiration from this stream or from the videos.

2914
07:07:49,709 --> 07:07:56,680
That means a lot. Thank you so much, Freudian. Thank you for the eleven dollars. Appreciate it.

2915
07:07:56,680 --> 07:08:03,099
Coming up to Colorblind Samurai thanks for the five dollars

2916
07:08:03,099 --> 07:08:07,470
and twelve cents. Hey Germans, just want to let you know that you mean a lot more to a lot of

2917
07:08:07,470 --> 07:08:11,470
us than you know. A year ago today my dad died of brain

2918
07:08:11,470 --> 07:08:15,470
cancer. Fuck cancer. And since then I've graduated from college, gotten a really

2919
07:08:15,470 --> 07:08:19,470
good job. But none of that would have been possible if I couldn't watch your streams and

2920
07:08:19,470 --> 07:08:23,470
vlogs to help me get back mentally from whatever shitty place I was in.

2921
07:08:23,470 --> 07:08:29,880
All the love I've got to you, man. I'm incredibly fucking sorry

2922
07:08:29,880 --> 07:08:36,990
to hear that. I'll tell you something right now though. Graduated from

2923
07:08:36,990 --> 07:08:47,479
college, got a great job. They'd be really fucking proud of you. Thank you

2924
07:08:47,479 --> 07:09:03,159
so much for being part of this community. And yeah, fuck cancer.

2925
07:09:03,159 --> 07:09:07,849
Hopefully someday soon we will get rid of that fucking awful, awful,

2926
07:09:07,849 --> 07:09:14,909
awful, awful thing forever. Thank you so much,

2927
07:09:14,909 --> 07:09:19,279
Colorblind Samurai for the five dollars and twelve cents. And I know I just kind of butchered

2928
07:09:19,279 --> 07:09:25,799
your name. But you know, that means a lot. That means a fucking lot.

2929
07:09:25,799 --> 07:09:41,549
I'm happy to be able to tell you that I

2930
07:09:41,549 --> 07:09:46,680
appreciate the fuck out of you being here. And if I can even give you a semblance, even a

2931
07:09:46,680 --> 07:09:50,680
second of happiness, in a place where you're not having a good time,

2932
07:09:50,680 --> 07:09:58,860
then fuck yeah. I'm happy to be there.

2933
07:09:58,860 --> 07:10:04,759
Thank you so much again for your five dollars and twelve cents. And yeah, fuck cancer.

2934
07:10:04,759 --> 07:10:19,599
For real. And congratulations on getting a good job. Cheers to

2935
07:10:19,599 --> 07:10:27,610
you. And moving on from that we've got Vroom had one dollar Vroom.

2936
07:10:27,610 --> 07:10:33,319
If you want to emulate video games you have to pretend that you're on the legit

2937
07:10:33,319 --> 07:10:39,869
hardware. L-U-L. Well that's not to do with pretending. If you want to emulate

2938
07:10:39,869 --> 07:10:44,430
video games you have to pretend that you're on the, no. The emulators just some

2939
07:10:44,430 --> 07:10:48,430
there's a whole list of games that can't run on those emulators.

2940
07:10:48,430 --> 07:10:53,119
And some of them that do are classified by the

2941
07:10:53,119 --> 07:11:03,240
community involved in trying to get them to work. I remember

2942
07:11:03,240 --> 07:11:07,240
I tried, I tried. This is not, this didn't happen on stream.

2943
07:11:07,240 --> 07:11:11,549
This happened, this was like a long time ago. Like two or three years ago.

2944
07:11:11,549 --> 07:11:16,040
It's not that long ago. But WWF No Mercy is one of my favorite Nintendo 64

2945
07:11:16,040 --> 07:11:20,860
games ever. I've owned that game like three times.

2946
07:11:20,860 --> 07:11:25,419
It's my favorite N64 game. Is that game.

2947
07:11:25,419 --> 07:11:30,349
Now, I wanted to play it, you know, a couple years ago.

2948
07:11:30,349 --> 07:11:34,349
And what happened was I got, I was like, ah, how am I going to track down any of this shit?

2949
07:11:34,349 --> 07:11:38,349
I tried to emulate it. And there was a ton of weird bugs and

2950
07:11:38,349 --> 07:11:42,349
problems and glitches. And I couldn't get it to work properly no matter what tutorials I tried.

2951
07:11:42,349 --> 07:11:46,590
So from that day forward I decided I was going to, I'm going

2952
07:11:46,590 --> 07:11:50,590
just legit only, I'm going to buy the hardware and just play it the way it was meant to be played

2953
07:11:50,590 --> 07:11:54,959
on an Nvidia graphics card. But not really.

2954
07:11:54,959 --> 07:12:09,919
The way it was meant to be played. Sponsored. Oh, internet.

2955
07:12:09,919 --> 07:12:16,139
I just saw a flash of bad internet. But didn't you try to get

2956
07:12:16,139 --> 07:12:22,299
the ISO for that Dreamcast game a week ago? Yeah, but that's, but

2957
07:12:22,299 --> 07:12:27,049
that was desperate because I bought the game. I purchased

2958
07:12:27,049 --> 07:12:31,049
that game and it came to me, delivered to me

2959
07:12:31,049 --> 07:12:36,250
the game that I bought. And it wasn't in the case.

2960
07:12:36,250 --> 07:12:40,250
It was half of the game. So I figured that's, that's

2961
07:12:40,250 --> 07:12:44,250
not, I'm okay. I own that game. I currently

2962
07:12:44,250 --> 07:12:50,970
have it sitting right here. I bought it. That's different. You know, you

2963
07:12:50,970 --> 07:12:57,259
can't sure me on that one. I purchased the game and the game

2964
07:12:57,259 --> 07:13:01,880
was not there. I got the second disc of two discs

2965
07:13:01,880 --> 07:13:06,060
for a game that I purchased and I can't just go to like Walmart or like

2966
07:13:06,060 --> 07:13:10,060
GameStop and buy a new one. The game doesn't even fucking exist anymore.

2967
07:13:10,060 --> 07:13:15,450
They're selling it like third party, fourth party.

2968
07:13:15,450 --> 07:13:19,880
So of course I'm going to look into some alternative actions and ways to make it work.

2969
07:13:19,880 --> 07:13:26,540
You guys act like that was like fucking, that was

2970
07:13:26,540 --> 07:13:31,099
like Battlefield 4. I can still, I can go buy that right now

2971
07:13:31,099 --> 07:13:43,720
and get it. They probably still sell that game at Walmart. Yeah, fourth party.

2972
07:13:43,720 --> 07:13:54,540
But here's the thing. Once you get the hardware, once you

2973
07:13:54,540 --> 07:13:58,540
slowly build up, like I've got PlayStation 1, I got the Dreamcast, I got PlayStation 2,

2974
07:13:58,540 --> 07:14:02,540
I got, well I had a Sega CD and then I gave it to

2975
07:14:02,540 --> 07:14:06,540
a friend of mine. But the point is then you have it all and you own it all.

2976
07:14:06,540 --> 07:14:10,540
And if you ever want to play like an N64 game, bingo, just go

2977
07:14:10,540 --> 07:14:15,099
get it and you just stick it in there and cap it and you can play it like

2978
07:14:15,099 --> 07:14:19,099
one to one real time the way it was meant to be played on the cartridge.

2979
07:14:19,099 --> 07:14:24,669
It's getting late to get this upset. I'm not upset. I'm just speaking matter of factly.

2980
07:14:24,669 --> 07:14:31,900
And then it breaks. And then you go get the emulator.

2981
07:14:31,900 --> 07:14:39,209
And you pretend that you're not on the emulator. Thank you though, Vroom. Appreciate it.

2982
07:14:39,209 --> 07:14:43,209
Sly 161, thanks for the $1. Hey, Jerma, it's midnight on the East Coast and that means it's officially

2983
07:14:43,209 --> 07:14:47,520
my birthday. Did you get me anything cool? I got you a

2984
07:14:47,520 --> 07:14:52,139
finger snap. No, happy birthday, Sly.

2985
07:14:52,139 --> 07:14:58,990
I don't know exactly how old you are, but happy birthday. Happy birthday.

2986
07:14:58,990 --> 07:15:07,439
Oh, cartridges die constantly. Well then I would back it up.

2987
07:15:07,439 --> 07:15:11,439
I would make the ROM myself. That's not against the law. I would put the ROM device in.

2988
07:15:11,439 --> 07:15:15,439
I would pull it from the source and I'd make my own ROM from my own cartridge.

2989
07:15:15,439 --> 07:15:27,799
That's what I would do. That's what I would be doing. But thank you, Sly. Happy birthday.

2990
07:15:27,799 --> 07:15:32,279
DorkCube, thanks for the $1. Hey, Jerma, I hope you and Kim

2991
07:15:32,279 --> 07:15:36,279
and Italics had a happy Valentine's Day. Well, I didn't have

2992
07:15:36,279 --> 07:15:40,279
a Valentine this year. I did find out that my brother is going to propose to his girlfriend tomorrow.

2993
07:15:40,279 --> 07:15:45,740
So I'm pretty excited. That's exciting stuff. I wish

2994
07:15:45,740 --> 07:15:51,319
your brother the best of luck and many years of happiness for you

2995
07:15:51,319 --> 07:15:58,250
and your brother. But yeah, me and Kim had a good...

2996
07:15:58,250 --> 07:16:02,250
We did a Valentine's Day before Valentine's Day

2997
07:16:02,250 --> 07:16:06,430
because it was also our anniversary on the 13th. So we did like a dual

2998
07:16:06,430 --> 07:16:10,430
let's go out and go to dinner and do like a Valentine's Day

2999
07:16:10,430 --> 07:16:14,430
before Valentine's. It's like Christmas with your birthday at the same time. You know, if you have your birthday the day before

3000
07:16:14,430 --> 07:16:19,479
Christmas, you know, you celebrate your birthday

3001
07:16:19,479 --> 07:16:24,459
and Christmas on the same day. It's a dual day. That's right.

3002
07:16:24,459 --> 07:16:30,729
What a ripoff. What? Ripoff. But thank you, DorkCube.

3003
07:16:30,729 --> 07:16:36,569
I wish luck to your brother and his girlfriend.

3004
07:16:36,569 --> 07:16:41,959
DemonicCucumber, thanks for the $1. This guy is asking the real questions. Who?

3005
07:16:41,959 --> 07:16:46,200
It's an immigrant link. Let's see. I'm trying to actually

3006
07:16:46,200 --> 07:16:50,200
gain some muscles on my bony arms, but I don't know where to start. Any recommendations for how I can get

3007
07:16:50,200 --> 07:16:54,200
started and be like 2012 Jerma? Yes.

3008
07:16:54,200 --> 07:17:00,159
Eat. You just, you gotta eat and eat and eat.

3009
07:17:00,159 --> 07:17:05,549
It's coming from a skinny, skinny, skinny guy.

3010
07:17:05,549 --> 07:17:11,069
You need to eat a shitload. And that does not mean McDonald's.

3011
07:17:11,069 --> 07:17:17,529
Okay? I'm not talking about, yeah, just go get like a large

3012
07:17:17,529 --> 07:17:21,529
pizza from Domino's and eat that and then go, no, no, no. You need high

3013
07:17:21,529 --> 07:17:27,119
quality, quality protein. You need to make sure that you're taking

3014
07:17:27,119 --> 07:17:31,119
a good amount, a good high quality protein a little bit before

3015
07:17:31,119 --> 07:17:37,599
and especially after you work out. Within like an hour,

3016
07:17:37,599 --> 07:17:41,599
within 30 minutes to an hour of you lifting weights, you've got to take in a high quality protein.

3017
07:17:41,599 --> 07:17:49,080
Your muscles need to recover, god damn it. You need to be eating a lot of calories,

3018
07:17:49,080 --> 07:17:53,080
but you don't want to eat bad garbage food. You want to eat high quality,

3019
07:17:53,080 --> 07:17:57,080
high calorie foods. This is kind of disgusting.

3020
07:17:57,080 --> 07:18:01,080
I'll tell you guys a little tidbit. Something that I used to do, but I do not, this is not advice.

3021
07:18:01,080 --> 07:18:06,409
I'm not giving advice to anybody. I don't want anyone to take this and be like, oh,

3022
07:18:06,409 --> 07:18:10,590
that's what I should do. Back when I was trying to really gain

3023
07:18:10,590 --> 07:18:16,490
mass, I would, does anybody know what tahini

3024
07:18:16,490 --> 07:18:27,799
is? Tahini. Tahini

3025
07:18:27,799 --> 07:18:32,560
is how they, it's what's in hummus. So hummus

3026
07:18:32,560 --> 07:18:36,560
is usually chickpeas, tahini,

3027
07:18:36,560 --> 07:18:40,560
and garlic and maybe a little bit of lime. It is

3028
07:18:40,560 --> 07:18:46,119
ground up sesame seeds and it is the highest

3029
07:18:46,119 --> 07:18:50,119
caloric food you can possibly eat pound for pound.

3030
07:18:50,119 --> 07:18:54,119
It is one of the highest calorie foods you could possibly eat

3031
07:18:54,119 --> 07:18:58,680
and I used to eat it like peanut butter. Speaking of peanut butter,

3032
07:18:58,680 --> 07:19:02,990
let's move on from that. Don't do what I do,

3033
07:19:02,990 --> 07:19:06,990
but tahini is really, really good. You put it on a salad,

3034
07:19:06,990 --> 07:19:10,990
you put it in, just use it where you should be using it. Don't eat spoonfuls of it like a psycho

3035
07:19:10,990 --> 07:19:14,990
because, I mean, it's like 300 calories a spoonful. Don't do that.

3036
07:19:14,990 --> 07:19:22,599
But peanut butter, that's your best friend. If you like peanut butter,

3037
07:19:22,599 --> 07:19:26,599
you can eat a lot of it and not really feel that guilty, but it's

3038
07:19:26,599 --> 07:19:32,569
high in fat. Just be careful. Don't go crazy because you don't want to cause

3039
07:19:32,569 --> 07:19:36,569
a stomach problem or a digestive issue for yourself if you're just like, oh, I gotta eat a jar of

3040
07:19:36,569 --> 07:19:43,049
peanut butter every day. High quality proteins, especially after you fucking work out.

3041
07:19:43,049 --> 07:19:52,279
But I used to just do a spoonful of tahini before bed.

3042
07:19:52,279 --> 07:19:57,360
It's not bad for you, it's a sesame seed paste, sesame seed spread, it's good.

3043
07:19:57,360 --> 07:20:04,330
Put it on a piece of toast. Somebody's mentioning fish, yes.

3044
07:20:04,330 --> 07:20:08,700
We're talking, I used to eat, but I don't, this is like bad advice though.

3045
07:20:08,700 --> 07:20:14,520
I used to eat tuna out of a can like a cat. I would eat like a can

3046
07:20:14,520 --> 07:20:19,659
of tuna. I would eat like the cheap,

3047
07:20:19,659 --> 07:20:23,659
cheapest tuna I could get out of a can. It was like

3048
07:20:23,659 --> 07:20:31,930
78 cents a can. Tuna's amazing, I love tuna fish, but I

3049
07:20:31,930 --> 07:20:38,409
ate it a lot, too much. I hate like the tuna fish.

3050
07:20:38,409 --> 07:20:48,590
But I did gain weight. Salmon,

3051
07:20:48,590 --> 07:20:53,279
there's also like the rock. Okay, listen to the rock, but don't listen to the rock

3052
07:20:53,279 --> 07:20:57,770
because the rock ate like 12 pounds of cod a day or something,

3053
07:20:57,770 --> 07:21:03,229
right? Fish is the best possible food you can eat if you really want to like body build

3054
07:21:03,229 --> 07:21:09,580
it, so it's just like good, high quality protein and high quality fats.

3055
07:21:09,580 --> 07:21:13,580
Don't think that just eating more is better. Like I said, going to get like a Big Mac every day is going to cause

3056
07:21:13,580 --> 07:21:21,150
you way more problems. The rock eats a three layer cake for breakfast

3057
07:21:21,150 --> 07:21:31,279
every day. But yeah, I loved when I was working out, I loved cod,

3058
07:21:31,279 --> 07:21:35,840
I loved tuna, I loved salmon. Chicken, just like

3059
07:21:35,840 --> 07:21:39,840
chicken breast is really easy to eat and really easy to make.

3060
07:21:39,840 --> 07:21:43,840
You can make a ton of it and just have like, you know, but don't eat like

3061
07:21:43,840 --> 07:21:48,840
fucking meats. Get like some good nice lean chicken breast.

3062
07:21:48,840 --> 07:21:52,840
Cook it up. Get some carrots in there. You want to eat a good amount of carrots

3063
07:21:52,840 --> 07:21:56,840
and like greens. You want a balanced, good diet. You want to be lifting

3064
07:21:56,840 --> 07:22:00,840
and you want to fucking bring those high quality proteins into your life. After you work out especially.

3065
07:22:00,840 --> 07:22:07,959
Don't rely, don't rely on the shit in the box

3066
07:22:07,959 --> 07:22:13,529
that says like, oh yeah, this is all these things in this box. Drink it.

3067
07:22:13,529 --> 07:22:18,599
Got to eat food. You can supplement with those like fucking drinks.

3068
07:22:18,599 --> 07:22:24,250
You can supplement with the drinks, but don't make those drinks

3069
07:22:24,250 --> 07:22:35,529
the main course for your routine. Eat carrots

3070
07:22:35,529 --> 07:22:45,529
before and after you work out. No, you don't have to do that. But yeah, I have not

3071
07:22:45,529 --> 07:22:50,520
been to the gym in a long time. I just got,

3072
07:22:50,520 --> 07:22:55,720
I wish I could still do it. It started getting harder to do post

3073
07:22:55,720 --> 07:23:01,500
30. It really did. 33, 34, it's

3074
07:23:01,500 --> 07:23:11,479
got hard to do. I really am deteriorating, huh?

3075
07:23:11,479 --> 07:23:17,709
Okay, if I was streaming, if I, okay, rewind

3076
07:23:17,709 --> 07:23:22,009
the clock, but also fast forward the clock, okay? If I

3077
07:23:22,009 --> 07:23:26,250
was where, if I'm right now in the twitch.tv seat

3078
07:23:26,250 --> 07:23:30,250
here, German 985 right now, and it's me

3079
07:23:30,250 --> 07:23:34,250
from 2012 sitting here, and I would have the webcam on, you guys

3080
07:23:34,250 --> 07:23:40,540
would see just how fucking jacked and handsome I was. People would be

3081
07:23:40,540 --> 07:23:48,040
commenting on it all the day. I would look over and like, I would

3082
07:23:48,040 --> 07:23:52,040
see my huge fucking arm in the rear view mirror,

3083
07:23:52,040 --> 07:23:56,220
and I would look over at chat and be like, fuck man, he's huge.

3084
07:23:56,220 --> 07:24:00,650
How did he get, he's fucking so jacked, and I'd be like, yeah, fuck, I am, yeah, yeah.

3085
07:24:00,650 --> 07:24:07,450
I wouldn't say that, but I'd be like, yeah, yeah, not anymore. Well, I look like I made

3086
07:24:07,450 --> 07:24:17,389
it a clay. It's amazing, it's really, here's the thing, it's amazing that

3087
07:24:17,389 --> 07:24:24,090
you never like see yourself age, but

3088
07:24:24,090 --> 07:24:28,720
there are certain specific things that I know and do that, because you

3089
07:24:28,720 --> 07:24:32,720
talk, I mean, talking about 2011 is when I started on YouTube, 2012.

3090
07:24:32,720 --> 07:24:36,720
Really, I like got going really in 2012. I made

3091
07:24:36,720 --> 07:24:41,470
a bunch of videos in 2011, but it's weird to see that over almost

3092
07:24:41,470 --> 07:24:45,470
seven to eight years, going from like 25 to

3093
07:24:45,470 --> 07:24:49,840
like 32, 26 to like 33,

3094
07:24:49,840 --> 07:24:59,630
it's a long time, you don't really even think about it. You look at, I look at

3095
07:24:59,630 --> 07:25:03,930
old videos, old photos from like 2010, 2011,

3096
07:25:03,930 --> 07:25:09,389
I'm just like, holy shit, I am like, I'm starting to look like my

3097
07:25:09,389 --> 07:25:15,099
father. When I look at photos of me now instead of almost 10 years ago,

3098
07:25:15,099 --> 07:25:29,040
I look like my father, I can see it, it's weird. Dad

3099
07:25:29,040 --> 07:25:35,200
streamer, I know, it's weird, but I'm not sure how we got on that, but it was

3100
07:25:35,200 --> 07:25:42,250
an interesting talk nonetheless. Thank you though, DemonicCucumber, for your

3101
07:25:42,250 --> 07:25:47,000
two dollars here. Hey Jerma, while I was watching your iSpy stream, I showed

3102
07:25:47,000 --> 07:25:51,000
my mum, yes the one who said you were attractive, some of my

3103
07:25:51,000 --> 07:25:55,000
renders, and we kept having to switch back because of your crazed rant

3104
07:25:55,000 --> 07:25:59,000
about the hot dog eating bear. She thought it was very funny, so

3105
07:25:59,000 --> 07:26:03,000
thanks on her behalf and mine for the laugh.

3106
07:26:03,000 --> 07:26:07,000
That's a great transition into the conversation we were just

3107
07:26:07,000 --> 07:26:11,180
having.

3108
07:26:11,180 --> 07:26:17,279
I love it. Thank you DemonicCucumber, and thank you mum.

3109
07:26:17,279 --> 07:26:23,630
Flugboy, thanks for the one dollar, I threw something together very quickly.

3110
07:26:23,630 --> 07:26:33,680
Let's see what they threw together. Is this a JoJo thing?

3111
07:26:33,680 --> 07:26:48,759
It's up perfectly. Why the fuck aren't the hippos yawning?

3112
07:26:48,759 --> 07:26:52,759
Here, take a look, there it is. It's apparently me stomping on a

3113
07:26:52,759 --> 07:26:59,630
what am I stepping on? And that's not even me, but

3114
07:26:59,630 --> 07:27:06,619
do I just automatically assume every anime I ever get shown is a JoJo's

3115
07:27:06,619 --> 07:27:12,330
Bizarre Adventure reference? Have we gotten there?

3116
07:27:12,330 --> 07:27:19,119
But thank you Flugboy. Thank you Captain Morgan for the one dollar they should

3117
07:27:19,119 --> 07:27:23,119
have got you to play younger Willem Dafoe in Aquaman. Why aren't you

3118
07:27:23,119 --> 07:27:31,310
out there acting?

3119
07:27:31,310 --> 07:27:36,490
I don't know. I'm doing this. I don't need to like,

3120
07:27:36,490 --> 07:27:45,599
go be an actor somewhere. This is an act.

3121
07:27:45,599 --> 07:27:49,599
No, I'm saying like, I don't gotta go like, move to Hollywood and like

3122
07:27:49,599 --> 07:27:55,240
start my acting career. I got this whole damn community, why would I

3123
07:27:55,240 --> 07:28:02,750
do that? Jerma can't act, yes I can, I can act

3124
07:28:02,750 --> 07:28:10,060
circles around anybody you could possibly put me in front of. I'm talking, anybody.

3125
07:28:10,060 --> 07:28:14,060
Especially, you talk about like Twitch, YouTube, but you find me somebody on like Twitch

3126
07:28:14,060 --> 07:28:19,770
YouTube that's a better actor than I am. I'll act anyone. And if you want to

3127
07:28:19,770 --> 07:28:24,080
make it a competition, let's do it. Find me somebody that like wants to be an actor, like

3128
07:28:24,080 --> 07:28:28,619
we'll have an acting composition in Las Vegas, in studio,

3129
07:28:28,619 --> 07:28:35,080
scripts, scenes, and I will destroy them all.

3130
07:28:35,080 --> 07:28:40,090
It won't even be a competition. You guys, I'm gonna upload the fuck away.

3131
07:28:40,090 --> 07:28:52,520
Give me something like, you gotta give me something like real, real fucking heavy too.

3132
07:28:52,520 --> 07:28:58,240
I'll be like a method actor, I'll fucking like smash something and fucking get like

3133
07:28:58,240 --> 07:29:04,200
lightning bolt, you'll hear me say all kinds of fucking swears. He's on his high

3134
07:29:04,200 --> 07:29:11,369
horse now. No, I can, I can out act anybody. I'm certain of it.

3135
07:29:11,369 --> 07:29:21,099
More like a meth actor, what the fuck. I'll show up

3136
07:29:21,099 --> 07:29:27,819
in like a big scarf and huge sunglasses

3137
07:29:27,819 --> 07:29:32,119
drinking like a really tiny coffee. I will destroy them.

3138
07:29:32,119 --> 07:29:49,790
Maybe one day. But thank you to Demonic Cucumber again

3139
07:29:49,790 --> 07:29:53,790
for the one dollar. It's weird to hear that the bit's minimum is going up.

3140
07:29:53,790 --> 07:29:57,790
I'll be okay. I usually donate about five dollars when I can.

3141
07:29:57,790 --> 07:30:01,790
I suppose I'll have to make my messages more compact. I do worry about the others

3142
07:30:01,790 --> 07:30:05,790
in the EU and those viewers everywhere else because bits are quite a bit more expensive

3143
07:30:05,790 --> 07:30:09,790
in some parts of the world. But I'm sure we'd be happier to put less strain on you

3144
07:30:09,790 --> 07:30:13,790
at the end of streams. Anyway, Jerma Heart as usual, mind how you go,

3145
07:30:13,790 --> 07:30:19,439
handsome boy. Yeah, I mean, it was not something that I just did

3146
07:30:19,439 --> 07:30:25,080
for either no reason or because I take it lightly.

3147
07:30:25,080 --> 07:30:30,159
I don't want to increase minimums to read, but sometimes

3148
07:30:30,159 --> 07:30:35,549
we have to make the stream,

3149
07:30:35,549 --> 07:30:41,639
the stream still has to be efficient. And as much as I would love to

3150
07:30:41,639 --> 07:30:45,819
be able to hang out all night and read bits, as the channel

3151
07:30:45,819 --> 07:30:49,819
grows, we have to keep the stream an efficient stream. We have to keep the stream

3152
07:30:49,819 --> 07:30:53,819
rolling and it gets late.

3153
07:30:53,819 --> 07:31:00,220
The stream ended at

3154
07:31:00,220 --> 07:31:07,279
about seven hours. So that was when the game was over.

3155
07:31:07,279 --> 07:31:11,279
The broadcast was pretty much just like, all right, the game's done. The thing that I

3156
07:31:11,279 --> 07:31:15,279
want to do tonight is done and we're going to hang out for a little bit afterwards.

3157
07:31:15,279 --> 07:31:19,279
But when it gets to a point where you've got like seven, eight, nine, ten hours,

3158
07:31:19,279 --> 07:31:24,400
there's two different options. There's either streamline it

3159
07:31:24,400 --> 07:31:28,639
to go really fast and read names and say,

3160
07:31:28,639 --> 07:31:32,639
oh, thank you, demonic key come for the one dollar. Thank you, unconquerable for the one dollar.

3161
07:31:32,639 --> 07:31:36,639
Thank you, mostly lost for the one dollar. Gambling addiction hotline.

3162
07:31:36,639 --> 07:31:40,639
That's funny. Thank you, unconquerable for a dollar. Thank you, Alex for the ten bucks. You deserve

3163
07:31:40,639 --> 07:31:45,069
something for that. I could blow through them. But that's not what the end of my

3164
07:31:45,069 --> 07:31:51,099
streams, that's not what I want to do. So streamlining the end

3165
07:31:51,099 --> 07:31:55,099
process and not bogging it down is

3166
07:31:55,099 --> 07:32:06,959
the goal. The German doesn't know the entire community is five guys making

3167
07:32:06,959 --> 07:32:13,680
fake accounts. As your audience grows, that will be harder.

3168
07:32:13,680 --> 07:32:17,979
I mean, look, we have to face a, you know,

3169
07:32:17,979 --> 07:32:22,349
a potential reality here. And that is, I'm not saying this is going

3170
07:32:22,349 --> 07:32:26,349
to happen, but if it does, you look at some streams that have

3171
07:32:26,349 --> 07:32:30,349
three, four, five thousand concurrent viewers, ten thousand concurrent viewers.

3172
07:32:30,349 --> 07:32:34,349
Sometimes some of these streams have six, seven, eight, nine, ten thousand

3173
07:32:34,349 --> 07:32:38,349
concurrent viewers. It's almost impossible to keep up.

3174
07:32:38,349 --> 07:32:43,340
Like actually impossible to keep up. So

3175
07:32:43,340 --> 07:32:47,340
the reality is if the channel keeps growing and if the community keeps

3176
07:32:47,340 --> 07:32:51,340
growing, these things are going to have to keep happening.

3177
07:32:51,340 --> 07:32:55,770
Not to an extent of, I mean, I would never make a bit reading minimum, but maybe

3178
07:32:55,770 --> 07:32:59,770
the bit reading minimum changes or doesn't happen anymore. Maybe, I don't know.

3179
07:32:59,770 --> 07:33:03,770
I can't tell you that it's, I have no idea what's going to happen. All I can

3180
07:33:03,770 --> 07:33:08,270
do is day to day, month to month, you know,

3181
07:33:08,270 --> 07:33:12,270
by yearly, maybe like once every year or two,

3182
07:33:12,270 --> 07:33:16,270
try to figure out solutions to keep the stream

3183
07:33:16,270 --> 07:33:20,270
going in an efficient and streamlined and fun way. Because as much as

3184
07:33:20,270 --> 07:33:24,270
people love this end of the stream portion of every single stream

3185
07:33:24,270 --> 07:33:28,759
I do now, there are a lot of people that just leave, right?

3186
07:33:28,759 --> 07:33:33,200
There are people that are just like, alright, he's got to the end of the stream, I'm out of here. And

3187
07:33:33,200 --> 07:33:37,630
you know, people will pop back in and be like, oh wait, you're still streaming? It's been like

3188
07:33:37,630 --> 07:33:48,330
three hours, you're still doing the end of the stream? Somebody's gave fifty dollars. Am Scoots,

3189
07:33:48,330 --> 07:33:55,840
thanks for fifty bucks. And they say, greedy streamer. But they think at the end,

3190
07:33:55,840 --> 07:34:00,779
thank you for the fucking fifty dollars. At the end of the day,

3191
07:34:00,779 --> 07:34:05,340
I also have to take into consideration, you know, me.

3192
07:34:05,340 --> 07:34:11,549
Right? Like I'm still, I'm the

3193
07:34:11,549 --> 07:34:15,549
one that's sitting in the chair and talking and I have to try to make it easy

3194
07:34:15,549 --> 07:34:21,709
for me to do as well. And if the end of the streams,

3195
07:34:21,709 --> 07:34:25,709
if like the second stream ends up being like a two, three,

3196
07:34:25,709 --> 07:34:30,720
four hour experience after the stream is over, you know, it can be hard

3197
07:34:30,720 --> 07:34:35,529
to do that. You know, every stream can't be

3198
07:34:35,529 --> 07:34:39,770
seven hours, eight hours of a stream, and then three,

3199
07:34:39,770 --> 07:34:47,150
four hours for reading bits. And a lot of what

3200
07:34:47,150 --> 07:34:51,150
somebody just mentioned, VR Josh just mentioned, would you ever consider having text to speech

3201
07:34:51,150 --> 07:34:55,150
donations? Absolutely not. Never. It'll never happen on this channel. It will never happen.

3202
07:34:55,150 --> 07:35:03,529
I cannot ever do it. Because

3203
07:35:03,529 --> 07:35:08,159
I have the opinion that text to speech audio

3204
07:35:08,159 --> 07:35:12,779
is, it kind of just gets in the way of the stream, like of the broadcast.

3205
07:35:12,779 --> 07:35:18,110
That's just my opinion on it. That's just how I feel about it. I'm not saying

3206
07:35:18,110 --> 07:35:22,279
that it's a wrong way to do your stream. It's just, I have,

3207
07:35:22,279 --> 07:35:26,279
I can't pay attention to that. I can't be trying to do something over here and

3208
07:35:26,279 --> 07:35:30,279
oh, let me take a picture of like the rhino. And then all of a sudden, bang! And somebody's like talking

3209
07:35:30,279 --> 07:35:36,250
in my ear. I do much better when I have very little distractions

3210
07:35:36,250 --> 07:35:44,700
because I'm so easily distracted anyways. And text to speech,

3211
07:35:44,700 --> 07:35:48,700
what text to speech can sometimes do is turn

3212
07:35:48,700 --> 07:35:52,700
a stream into a

3213
07:35:52,700 --> 07:35:57,639
just, everybody's just fucking writing random shit

3214
07:35:57,639 --> 07:36:02,139
that's just gonna be blasted out to a ton of people. So it's less about

3215
07:36:02,139 --> 07:36:06,139
hey, this person is streaming this game, or this person is streaming this event or something, and more

3216
07:36:06,139 --> 07:36:10,139
just full blasting voice talking

3217
07:36:10,139 --> 07:36:25,959
out loud to a bunch of people. But people run their communities the way that they want to

3218
07:36:25,959 --> 07:36:29,959
and that's fine. And I do see like the fun

3219
07:36:29,959 --> 07:36:34,509
in somebody having a system where you can just kind of be

3220
07:36:34,509 --> 07:36:40,540
on stream. Like that's kind of fucking fun. That's kind of cool. Having somebody pop

3221
07:36:40,540 --> 07:36:45,680
up and just be like, their name pops up and this is them talking.

3222
07:36:45,680 --> 07:36:49,680
And they can say, they can just like shitpost, they can say something funny, they can say something interesting.

3223
07:36:49,680 --> 07:37:00,169
I understand that. But I don't think I'd ever want that on my stream.

3224
07:37:00,169 --> 07:37:04,169
So I have to figure out other ways to

3225
07:37:04,169 --> 07:37:09,369
interact with the community. And I think, I thought this was a decent idea

3226
07:37:09,369 --> 07:37:13,369
kind of just doing reading and hanging out at the end of a stream when

3227
07:37:13,369 --> 07:37:17,369
I'm not gonna get distracted by messages or

3228
07:37:17,369 --> 07:37:24,299
sounds or noises or, and I felt like this solution

3229
07:37:24,299 --> 07:37:28,299
was the best one. But this solution is so strange, I think, that it

3230
07:37:28,299 --> 07:37:34,459
needs constant care to still work.

3231
07:37:34,459 --> 07:37:38,459
So that's why things like minimums have to increase. That's why eventually

3232
07:37:38,459 --> 07:37:43,020
maybe some other things might have to change about it as well. But I'm not gonna cross any of those

3233
07:37:43,020 --> 07:37:48,090
bridges until it's certain of what those things have to be. So at the end

3234
07:37:48,090 --> 07:37:52,090
of the day, as of this weekend here, we are going up to $2.50.

3235
07:37:52,090 --> 07:37:58,110
$2.50 to help streamline the end of the stream.

3236
07:37:58,110 --> 07:38:13,849
And it was three. It was three. So I did

3237
07:38:13,849 --> 07:38:18,090
bring it down back from three because of the way the bits are purchased.

3238
07:38:18,090 --> 07:38:24,680
We'll keep going. We'll see. But thank you, Demonic Cucumber.

3239
07:38:24,680 --> 07:38:29,240
Thank you, Unconquerabee for the $1. Shut up and play.

3240
07:38:29,240 --> 07:38:33,680
I'm not sure what I was doing, but hopefully I shut up and played.

3241
07:38:33,680 --> 07:38:42,509
Or maybe I didn't. Maybe I decided I wanted to do something else.

3242
07:38:42,509 --> 07:38:46,509
Maybe if I didn't want to play and I wanted to just say something, maybe that's what I'm gonna do.

3243
07:38:46,509 --> 07:38:55,150
Maybe that's gonna happen. But thank you. Thank you, Mostly Lost for the $1.

3244
07:38:55,150 --> 07:39:00,349
The National Gambling Addiction Hotline. Oh, there it is again. Keep that in mind whenever you go

3245
07:39:00,349 --> 07:39:04,349
triple or nothing on a bet and lose within 30 seconds. I went triple or nothing and I won.

3246
07:39:04,349 --> 07:39:12,169
Thank you, Unconquerabee for the $1. Again, I enjoyed watching this edition of

3247
07:39:12,169 --> 07:39:16,169
German 985, The Legend of the Triple Dog Beer. Anyway, it's been a while and I haven't donated

3248
07:39:16,169 --> 07:39:20,169
in a bit. Glad I got to catch a bit of this stream before I slept.

3249
07:39:20,169 --> 07:39:24,169
Can't wait for the next stream and I hope you keep your gambling tendencies to a minimum.

3250
07:39:24,169 --> 07:39:29,680
Much love, German Heart. Thank you. No, it was a lot of fun. I liked this game

3251
07:39:29,680 --> 07:39:34,240
and I liked this stream and I liked this. It was fun. We had a good time.

3252
07:39:34,240 --> 07:39:38,240
Alex Onyx, thanks for the $10. You deserve something for that.

3253
07:39:38,240 --> 07:39:43,689
$10 apparently from Alex. Thank you.

3254
07:39:43,689 --> 07:39:50,540
Unhealthy Habits. You guys act like...

3255
07:39:50,540 --> 07:39:57,709
Like, I gotta make gambling references.

3256
07:39:57,709 --> 07:40:01,880
I live in Las Vegas, right? That's an easy joke.

3257
07:40:01,880 --> 07:40:06,319
I got so many easy gambling and casino references to make because I live here.

3258
07:40:06,319 --> 07:40:10,490
That's like 75% of the reason why I moved here. So I can make

3259
07:40:10,490 --> 07:40:20,939
casino reference jokes because it's easy comedy. And if you believe that,

3260
07:40:20,939 --> 07:40:28,560
the fuck. But thank you, Alex. Thank you, Most of the Lost for the $1. You know the game has a

3261
07:40:28,560 --> 07:40:32,560
lot of its... You know the game has lost its comedic value when the funniest thing you

3262
07:40:32,560 --> 07:40:39,340
can do is be silent for 15 minutes. And that was fun.

3263
07:40:39,340 --> 07:40:43,340
It was fun. Hey, German 985! Thanks for the 50 community subs, German

3264
07:40:43,340 --> 07:40:48,279
985. And then HaHaHaKuma

3265
07:40:48,279 --> 07:40:52,909
gave 50 as well, making the 100 community subs

3266
07:40:52,909 --> 07:40:56,909
original bet be paid off completely. The debt has been cleared.

3267
07:40:56,909 --> 07:41:01,790
Thank you so much. Thank you, Jerma. Thank you so

3268
07:41:01,790 --> 07:41:07,180
much, man. Holy fuck. How much fucking money is that? How much money is that? How much fucking money

3269
07:41:07,180 --> 07:41:13,150
is that shit? But thank you, HaHaHa. That was... You didn't... You didn't have to

3270
07:41:13,150 --> 07:41:17,389
do that. And you did, so thank you. PizzaBot. Thanks for the $5, PizzaBot.

3271
07:41:17,389 --> 07:41:21,389
I'm pretty sure you almost hit enlightenment with being quiet for so

3272
07:41:21,389 --> 07:41:28,639
long. Something or other thanks to the $1 didn't make a business logo,

3273
07:41:28,639 --> 07:41:34,279
went with a shitty postcard instead. Yeah, that

3274
07:41:34,279 --> 07:41:38,279
works too. That works too. Greetings from Toronto.

3275
07:41:38,279 --> 07:41:46,919
Welcome to Brazil. What? It does make a pretty good postcard.

3276
07:41:46,919 --> 07:41:55,500
Thank you Clueless Sniper for the $1. Mostly lost. Thanks for the $1.

3277
07:41:55,500 --> 07:41:59,500
Also, please don't feel bad about missing my bits. It's really not a big deal.

3278
07:41:59,500 --> 07:42:04,959
Yeah, but it was a lot of money. And I don't ever want to bypass

3279
07:42:04,959 --> 07:42:08,959
somebody's major massive monetary contribution

3280
07:42:08,959 --> 07:42:13,840
to the stream. You know, it's... I want to make sure that you

3281
07:42:13,840 --> 07:42:20,360
know that I see it. Because it's a lot of money. But thank you.

3282
07:42:20,360 --> 07:42:24,360
Thank you Flammable Cow for the $10. May I suggest you play Spongebob Squarepants

3283
07:42:24,360 --> 07:42:28,360
Battle for Bikini Bottom. I was hovering over the purchase button, but I didn't

3284
07:42:28,360 --> 07:42:33,759
buy it. Love the streams. You're a great guy. Keep doing you.

3285
07:42:33,759 --> 07:42:39,529
I was going to buy Spongebob Square, but I didn't know what to do. There's like

3286
07:42:39,529 --> 07:42:43,529
six PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, Nickelodeon, Spongebob

3287
07:42:43,529 --> 07:42:47,529
included games. And I didn't know which one was the one to buy. Is it Battle for Bikini Bottom?

3288
07:42:47,529 --> 07:42:52,409
Is that the one? Is that the one that I'm going to beat on stream?

3289
07:42:52,409 --> 07:42:56,409
Is that the Simpsons Hit and Run 2 where I play that game for like a 12 hour session and beat the whole game?

3290
07:42:56,409 --> 07:43:03,340
Is that an angry game? Am I mad at that game?

3291
07:43:03,340 --> 07:43:12,639
No? Is it just fun? Is that a game where you have to be

3292
07:43:12,639 --> 07:43:20,270
picture perfect? Yeah, Nicktoons Unite is one that I saw.

3293
07:43:20,270 --> 07:43:26,860
I was going to get it. Did you actually beat Hit and Run? Oh yeah.

3294
07:43:26,860 --> 07:43:31,229
I did it in one stream. I sat there for like 13 hours and did the whole thing.

3295
07:43:31,229 --> 07:43:36,880
I probably lost a handful of brain cells doing it, but

3296
07:43:36,880 --> 07:43:44,169
I still did it. But yeah, you'll probably see that at some point soon.

3297
07:43:44,169 --> 07:43:49,880
Silver Catalyst. Thanks for the five dollars, Silver Catalyst.

3298
07:43:49,880 --> 07:43:53,880
Hey Jerm, I've been watching you for around five years, but only recently been watching

3299
07:43:53,880 --> 07:43:57,880
your streams, and it's phenomenal how much joy you bring to me. Love your content.

3300
07:43:57,880 --> 07:44:01,880
Also, have you seen this rhythm game called Osu? Someone mapped

3301
07:44:01,880 --> 07:44:05,880
Rats Birthday Mixtape and it's one of the hardest maps ever full combo'd.

3302
07:44:05,880 --> 07:44:09,880
Did somebody link this before?

3303
07:44:09,880 --> 07:44:15,979
Yeah, I remember this. So hold on a second. Do I have the hardest

3304
07:44:15,979 --> 07:44:29,290
level in Osu? Do I have the hardest level in the game? No?

3305
07:44:29,290 --> 07:44:40,889
This is 655pp. What's that mean? Am I in the top 50

3306
07:44:40,889 --> 07:44:52,990
hardest levels in the game? This is a rhythm game, right?

3307
07:44:52,990 --> 07:44:56,990
655 is really high actually, really. That's cool. I think we watched that once before.

3308
07:44:56,990 --> 07:45:03,959
But that's really cool.

3309
07:45:03,959 --> 07:45:07,959
Hardest game for the streamer that plays the hardest games and is really focused

3310
07:45:07,959 --> 07:45:19,479
and gets the job done on stream. That's what I say.

3311
07:45:19,479 --> 07:45:23,479
Is there a Rats Mixtape map in Beat Saber? I think there is. I think somebody showed it to us

3312
07:45:23,479 --> 07:45:28,939
a while ago. PP is the scoring system. It's one of the hardest maps

3313
07:45:28,939 --> 07:45:37,240
DW. Alright, well that's crazy.

3314
07:45:37,240 --> 07:45:42,319
Thank you to the five dollars, Silver Catalyst, and thanks for the video.

3315
07:45:42,319 --> 07:45:46,750
Good luck on all you Osu players. I think you can beat the Rats Mixtape

3316
07:45:46,750 --> 07:45:52,080
level. It's the hardest level in the game. Good luck.

3317
07:45:52,080 --> 07:45:56,080
Uripterida.

3318
07:45:56,080 --> 07:46:00,080
Thanks for the one dollar. College is stressful but your streams always brighten my day.

3319
07:46:00,080 --> 07:46:04,700
Germahart. Gonna be a vet tech when I'm done with this. Awesome.

3320
07:46:04,700 --> 07:46:08,700
Told you guys this before. If I wasn't a streamer or a tuber,

3321
07:46:08,700 --> 07:46:12,700
either one, I would probably go into the veterinary field

3322
07:46:12,700 --> 07:46:16,700
to do with animals. I would own a backyard with a bunch of

3323
07:46:16,700 --> 07:46:22,220
acres of land and I have an elephant. I don't know how to pronounce it either.

3324
07:46:22,220 --> 07:46:30,799
Okay, good. That's good. And then we have two dollars from

3325
07:46:30,799 --> 07:46:35,099
Garfield the Monday Killer. We've got two very large

3326
07:46:35,099 --> 07:46:41,000
Garfagraphs here. Why am I even saying the word

3327
07:46:41,000 --> 07:46:46,569
Garfagraph? It's a paragraph. Don't call it a Garfagraph.

3328
07:46:46,569 --> 07:46:50,569
Hey there Germah, long time no bits. Garf has been out on a Himalayan expedition of magnificent

3329
07:46:50,569 --> 07:46:54,569
magnitude, still murdering Mondays as usual,

3330
07:46:54,569 --> 07:46:58,569
but a whole lot of toony business I had to take care of. Dick Dasterly

3331
07:46:58,569 --> 07:47:02,750
and Muttley even stole all of Garf Bucks and I had to team up with Twitch

3332
07:47:02,750 --> 07:47:06,750
staff in order to put those villains behind bars. How was your Valentine's, Germah? Garf had a surprisingly

3333
07:47:06,750 --> 07:47:10,750
good one despite the Monday-like break up of a few months ago. My two gal

3334
07:47:10,750 --> 07:47:14,750
pals and I made a sorry I ran out of space on the last

3335
07:47:14,750 --> 07:47:18,750
Garfagraph. He he. Anyway, we all, we weren't, we went out and

3336
07:47:18,750 --> 07:47:22,750
did sweet things for one another. We may not be romantically interested, but just hanging out with two good pals

3337
07:47:22,750 --> 07:47:26,750
is just as Garfy. In case you want to know who they are,

3338
07:47:26,750 --> 07:47:30,750
it was Cora from Avatar and Sombra from Overwatch. Okay.

3339
07:47:30,750 --> 07:47:34,750
Yeah, Garf hangs out with Sombra for some reason. That sounds like a funny

3340
07:47:34,750 --> 07:47:38,750
LARPing cartoon joke, but those two actually go to conventions as those

3341
07:47:38,750 --> 07:47:57,200
characters. They're very, they're, thank you Garfield

3342
07:47:57,200 --> 07:48:03,659
for the two dollars. I'm glad you're doing well.

3343
07:48:03,659 --> 07:48:07,659
Tingy, thanks for the one dollar. Cox has delayed this, but here's my hundred dollar message. Thank you, Tingy.

3344
07:48:07,659 --> 07:48:12,349
Yeah, sorry about the stream dying after like an hour and forty minutes a few

3345
07:48:12,349 --> 07:48:16,840
days ago. It was not my intention. I'm sorry that some people got left in

3346
07:48:16,840 --> 07:48:23,000
the dust there, so thank you so much for the huge amount of money. This two dollar and

3347
07:48:23,000 --> 07:48:27,000
fifty cent increase is going to cut into Garfield's savings.

3348
07:48:27,000 --> 07:48:33,340
Gold Ruby production, thanks for the one dollar.

3349
07:48:33,340 --> 07:48:37,520
How is Shito doing? Hope he is well. Shito's doing great.

3350
07:48:37,520 --> 07:48:41,759
He's been asleep for like seven days. That's typically how it works.

3351
07:48:41,759 --> 07:48:45,759
You know how a camel only has to eat or drink like once or like every

3352
07:48:45,759 --> 07:48:49,759
two weeks? Shito is like a camel. Instead of

3353
07:48:49,759 --> 07:48:53,759
eating, he sleeps for like two weeks and then gets up and eats

3354
07:48:53,759 --> 07:48:59,319
some dog food. His favorite. Wakes up

3355
07:48:59,319 --> 07:49:03,319
and plays himself as an instrument. He talks.

3356
07:49:03,319 --> 07:49:09,020
That sounded really bad.

3357
07:49:09,020 --> 07:49:13,020
If a pet is sleeping for seven days, it means it's

3358
07:49:13,020 --> 07:49:24,159
dead.

3359
07:49:24,159 --> 07:49:30,729
That's so terrible. Yeah, he's been sleeping for seven

3360
07:49:30,729 --> 07:49:34,729
days. Thank you, Gold Ruby production. Shito's doing

3361
07:49:34,729 --> 07:49:39,799
just fine. Anything else? Show official. Thanks for the six bucks.

3362
07:49:39,799 --> 07:49:44,040
You ever thought about playing New Vegas with mods? I know you played New Vegas, but the stream was pretty great.

3363
07:49:44,040 --> 07:49:49,310
I thought with mods it would be funnier. Also, you're amazing.

3364
07:49:49,310 --> 07:49:53,310
That's incredibly nice thing to say about somebody. Thank you for that. And to answer the question,

3365
07:49:53,310 --> 07:49:59,639
not now. Not now. Revisiting old stuff

3366
07:49:59,639 --> 07:50:03,639
or games that I played before and adding new content

3367
07:50:03,639 --> 07:50:08,909
is something that we need to go back to eventually.

3368
07:50:08,909 --> 07:50:14,240
Maybe. Because it needs to be like out of my brain completely. I know it's been a few

3369
07:50:14,240 --> 07:50:21,470
years, but it might be worth doing. The thing is though, once you do

3370
07:50:21,470 --> 07:50:25,470
mods, once I do like fucking mods, the game is just

3371
07:50:25,470 --> 07:50:29,639
forever. I can never go back ever again. That happened with the Skyrim.

3372
07:50:29,639 --> 07:50:33,639
Did I do that in Oblivion? I did not do it with Oblivion. I did it with Skyrim,

3373
07:50:33,639 --> 07:50:38,720
and I never went back and played Skyrim the same way ever again. So, putting a bunch of like

3374
07:50:38,720 --> 07:50:42,959
crazy, fun, interesting mods into

3375
07:50:42,959 --> 07:50:49,869
New Vegas. Oh my god.

3376
07:50:49,869 --> 07:50:54,750
Another 50 bucks from Amskoods. 100 dollars total from Amskoods.

3377
07:50:54,750 --> 07:51:00,080
I take it back, you're not a greedy streamer with a smiley face. Hey, thanks.

3378
07:51:00,080 --> 07:51:10,939
Thank you for the 100 bucks. That's a ton of money. But yeah,

3379
07:51:10,939 --> 07:51:17,209
I'm not opposed to the idea. It does sound fun.

3380
07:51:17,209 --> 07:51:21,209
Thank you Dorkcube for the one dollar. How does Garfield always know exactly what to write in order to confuse Jeremy?

3381
07:51:21,209 --> 07:51:27,869
Well, it's not like confusing. It's just like

3382
07:51:27,869 --> 07:51:32,040
two paragraphs of stuff that

3383
07:51:32,040 --> 07:51:36,479
isn't even real. It's just like huge strings

3384
07:51:36,479 --> 07:51:40,479
of shit that's not even real. It's just like talking about John

3385
07:51:40,479 --> 07:51:50,090
and going like grocery store shopping. Hey, speaking of Garfield, the Monday

3386
07:51:50,090 --> 07:51:54,330
killer. Thanks for the one dollar. I actually stopped donating bits to give

3387
07:51:54,330 --> 07:51:58,330
Jerma a break from my Garfer graphs, but that last reading might have been one of

3388
07:51:58,330 --> 07:52:02,330
the hardest he struggled to get through it. Oh my gosh, Jerma, I'm so sorry.

3389
07:52:02,330 --> 07:52:07,659
Please don't hate the Garf. He just wants to make you laugh. Take that back.

3390
07:52:07,659 --> 07:52:11,659
You fuck.

3391
07:52:11,659 --> 07:52:15,659
I gotta give pauses between statements.

3392
07:52:15,659 --> 07:52:21,049
Because I'm gonna copy and paste that.

3393
07:52:21,049 --> 07:52:26,560
Look, look. See, this is me

3394
07:52:26,560 --> 07:52:36,169
quoting Dorkcube. But thank you Garfield. No,

3395
07:52:36,169 --> 07:52:40,599
the stuff you say is fucking funny. It's hard for me to follow. There's so much going on

3396
07:52:40,599 --> 07:52:51,610
in the Garfield lore. But thank you so much, Garfield. What happened to the music?

3397
07:52:51,610 --> 07:52:58,459
I need you to laugh at my joke.

3398
07:52:58,459 --> 07:53:02,459
Poor Garfield. No, everybody loves Garfield. Well, nobody likes

3399
07:53:02,459 --> 07:53:06,639
Garfield. But the fake Garfield that's not the real Garfield

3400
07:53:06,639 --> 07:53:12,349
is in this community and everybody loves the fake Garfield. More like

3401
07:53:12,349 --> 07:53:18,830
dumb985. Why do people get me to try to

3402
07:53:18,830 --> 07:53:24,090
read the same thing? Please laugh at this. Why would I laugh at that?

3403
07:53:24,090 --> 07:53:34,650
What? This is the real Garfield. This is not the real Garfield.

3404
07:53:34,650 --> 07:53:39,659
This is the better Garfield. This is like the original Garfield when

3405
07:53:39,659 --> 07:53:44,139
he used to be fat and funny. Instead of like a plush toy

3406
07:53:44,139 --> 07:53:51,259
that has a cartoon. Garfield the Monday Killer with the dollar.

3407
07:53:51,259 --> 07:53:55,259
What are you talking about, Jerma? I'm the real Garfield. Come on, folks. Give Jerma a round of applause.

3408
07:53:55,259 --> 07:54:07,360
What a funny Garfster. And this is the video.

3409
07:54:11,360 --> 07:54:18,090
That was the Will Smith Genie.

3410
07:54:18,090 --> 07:54:34,729
Oh, man. There it is.

3411
07:54:34,729 --> 07:54:44,009
Alright, I'm going to make a prediction. You ready?

3412
07:54:44,009 --> 07:54:48,959
If I, we're going to price is right this. Or at least like

3413
07:54:48,959 --> 07:54:52,959
over under a little bit here. I'm okay. The Aladdin live action

3414
07:54:52,959 --> 07:54:58,090
movie will have within five percentile

3415
07:54:58,090 --> 07:55:03,849
28% on Rotten Tomatoes. Okay. So that means

3416
07:55:03,849 --> 07:55:07,849
if it's anywhere within 5, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32,

3417
07:55:07,849 --> 07:55:14,959
33, 28, 27, 26, 25, 34, 23.

3418
07:55:14,959 --> 07:55:23,680
28%. If I get it dead on, then I get the jackpot. If

3419
07:55:23,680 --> 07:55:27,680
the live action Aladdin has a higher Rotten Tomatoes than Venom,

3420
07:55:27,680 --> 07:55:34,200
I'll be very surprised. What is Venom at right now? I think it's like

3421
07:55:34,200 --> 07:55:39,209
32, right? 29. Okay, 29% on Rotten Tomatoes

3422
07:55:39,209 --> 07:55:50,409
right now. 28%. See you in like three weeks.

3423
07:55:50,409 --> 07:56:00,139
Wait, when does that movie come out? Like next year? I have no idea.

3424
07:56:00,139 --> 07:56:06,360
But thank you, Garfield. And thank you, that was

3425
07:56:06,360 --> 07:56:11,419
awesome. I believe we're not awesome. Awesome Triss.

3426
07:56:11,419 --> 07:56:16,490
That video. And finally, two more here. Dorkcube, thanks for the one dollar.

3427
07:56:16,490 --> 07:56:20,490
You're making me mad, mister. Stop saying Garfield isn't real. He is real. I know it.

3428
07:56:20,490 --> 07:56:26,459
He eats lasagna, and lasagna is real. Explain that.

3429
07:56:26,459 --> 07:56:31,150
Lasagna is like as if somebody took a fucking textbook,

3430
07:56:31,150 --> 07:56:35,639
wet all the pages, and in between each page put a bunch

3431
07:56:35,639 --> 07:56:39,639
of cheese and sauce, and then put it in the fucking oven.

3432
07:56:39,639 --> 07:56:54,319
When did I tell you it didn't taste good? I didn't tell you it didn't taste good. When did I

3433
07:56:54,319 --> 07:56:58,490
say that? When did I say that lasagna is bad? When did I say that

3434
07:56:58,490 --> 07:57:02,799
lasagna is not tasty? It's just a textbook that has

3435
07:57:02,799 --> 07:57:16,250
been wet and put in the oven and cheese all over it. It's still good?

3436
07:57:16,250 --> 07:57:20,750
Uh oh, he's getting political again. Guys, I love lasagna. I'm fucking kidding.

3437
07:57:20,750 --> 07:57:29,959
I actually haven't eaten lasagna in probably five years.

3438
07:57:29,959 --> 07:57:34,200
That's a real 5% statement. I have

3439
07:57:34,200 --> 07:57:40,360
not eaten lasagna in five years. If I'm going to have lasagna,

3440
07:57:40,360 --> 07:57:44,729
I just want chicken parm instead. No, that's not a lie.

3441
07:57:44,729 --> 07:57:56,459
I have not had lasagna. I have not eaten lasagna maybe even in ten years.

3442
07:57:56,459 --> 07:58:02,619
I don't think I have. I don't think so. Fettuccine Alfredo.

3443
07:58:02,619 --> 07:58:06,990
I want that. Lasagna. Is that on the menu? No.

3444
07:58:06,990 --> 07:58:12,439
What else is on the menu? I'm not going to order lasagna.

3445
07:58:12,439 --> 07:58:22,560
You can't even order lasagna at a restaurant. You have to make lasagna.

3446
07:58:22,560 --> 07:58:31,849
What restaurant has lasagna on the menu? I've never seen

3447
07:58:31,849 --> 07:58:40,189
just default lasagna at an Italian restaurant. The Olive Garden?

3448
07:58:40,189 --> 07:58:49,479
You can't put Olive Garden. Every Italian restaurant

3449
07:58:49,479 --> 07:58:55,319
has lasagna on the menu. They don't? I'm talking about

3450
07:58:55,319 --> 07:59:02,509
nobody has a default lasagna. Risotto.

3451
07:59:02,509 --> 07:59:06,509
Uh, rigatoni.

3452
07:59:06,509 --> 07:59:12,139
Fettuccine Alfredo. Chicken broccoli ziti. Chicken parm.

3453
07:59:12,139 --> 07:59:21,479
Chicken marsala. Shrimp scampi. No, just because it's had

3454
07:59:21,479 --> 07:59:30,970
chilies. Yeah, alright, so there's a lasagna at like

3455
07:59:30,970 --> 07:59:42,939
Friday's. Meatballs, right? Let's look at the TGI

3456
07:59:42,939 --> 07:59:53,439
Friday's menu and see what they got. Okay, we got loaded chicken nachos.

3457
07:59:53,439 --> 07:59:57,680
Cheeseburger sliders. Philly cheesesteak egg rolls.

3458
07:59:57,680 --> 08:00:01,849
What the fuck? Philly cheesesteak egg rolls. Wings roulette

3459
08:00:01,849 --> 08:00:09,099
platter. Chicken quesadilla. No, we've got to go down. Friday's classics.

3460
08:00:09,099 --> 08:00:16,000
Bucket of bones. That's what this is actually called.

3461
08:00:16,000 --> 08:00:20,540
Whiskey sliders. Chicken strips.

3462
08:00:20,540 --> 08:00:25,610
Come on, where is it? There's mozzarella sticks. Wings.

3463
08:00:25,610 --> 08:00:31,240
Burgers. Soups and salads. I'm not making

3464
08:00:31,240 --> 08:00:35,610
that up. It actually says bucket of bones. Sandwiches.

3465
08:00:35,610 --> 08:00:41,500
Pasta. Here we go. Nope. Cajun shrimp and chicken pasta.

3466
08:00:41,500 --> 08:00:48,040
Chicken parmesan pasta. Lemon and garlic shrimp pasta.

3467
08:00:48,040 --> 08:00:52,860
Alright, Olive Garden. Olive Garden. Olive Garden

3468
08:00:52,860 --> 08:01:01,000
menu. Okay, if there is no default

3469
08:01:01,000 --> 08:01:13,819
lasagna on this menu, you guys have to apologize to me. Okay,

3470
08:01:13,819 --> 08:01:19,790
we're looking for the dinner menu at Olive Garden. Okay,

3471
08:01:19,790 --> 08:01:24,599
we've got appetizers. Create your own pasta bowl.

3472
08:01:24,599 --> 08:01:29,099
Classic favorites. Okay, what do we got for a classic favorite?

3473
08:01:29,099 --> 08:01:34,919
It's like, here we go. Bolognese.

3474
08:01:34,919 --> 08:01:38,919
Creamy mushroom. Ravioli. A tour of Italy.

3475
08:01:38,919 --> 08:01:42,919
Cheese ravioli. Shrimp alfredo. Seafood alfredo. Chicken alfredo.

3476
08:01:42,919 --> 08:01:46,919
Chicken parm. Chicken scampi. Five cheese ziti.

3477
08:01:46,919 --> 08:01:50,919
Fettuccine alfredo. Eggplant parm. Lasagna classico.

3478
08:01:50,919 --> 08:02:00,599
I've never seen a lasagna on a menu at an Italian restaurant.

3479
08:02:00,599 --> 08:02:06,189
Olive Garden does not count. No, Olive Garden

3480
08:02:06,189 --> 08:02:10,939
doesn't count. Olive Garden is not an Italian restaurant.

3481
08:02:10,939 --> 08:02:30,990
Olive Garden is like the subway of Italian restaurants. What's wrong with subway?

3482
08:02:30,990 --> 08:02:38,729
They're going under. I got some real, real bad news for all you subway

3483
08:02:38,729 --> 08:02:42,729
fans. I don't see that company still existing in like 20

3484
08:02:42,729 --> 08:03:01,099
years. And they're taking all the lasagna with them. Feels bad, man.

3485
08:03:01,099 --> 08:03:05,099
It's because they don't have lasagna. It's the first time I've ever seen lasagna on a menu.

3486
08:03:05,099 --> 08:03:17,520
I swear to God. I'm okay with that.

3487
08:03:17,520 --> 08:03:26,860
I haven't had it. I haven't eaten

3488
08:03:26,860 --> 08:03:30,860
lasagna in five fucking years. I'm not kidding. I swear.

3489
08:03:30,860 --> 08:03:41,930
Wait, am I hearing right that lasagna is also not Italian?

3490
08:03:41,930 --> 08:04:01,259
Hold on a minute. Where does lasagna come from? Italy.

3491
08:04:01,259 --> 08:04:05,259
Lasagna, in Italy at least, has never been an everyday dish.

3492
08:04:05,259 --> 08:04:09,630
Those delicate sheets of fresh egg pasta, the complex sauces and ingredients

3493
08:04:09,630 --> 08:04:14,250
for the filling, it'd be a momentous occasion

3494
08:04:14,250 --> 08:04:18,430
to be with all that work. That's why in the North, lasagna

3495
08:04:18,430 --> 08:04:39,360
is not even, they don't even eat it there. Lasagna.

3496
08:04:39,360 --> 08:04:46,409
All right. I'm sorry, man. But look, look. I mean, that looks

3497
08:04:46,409 --> 08:05:09,150
like as appetizing as a catcher's mitt.

3498
08:05:09,150 --> 08:05:13,150
Somebody worked hard on that. It's not their fault. Lasagna just looks like

3499
08:05:13,150 --> 08:05:18,479
that. Lasagna just looks like cat puke.

3500
08:05:18,479 --> 08:05:26,540
That's not, look, you can make the best lasagna in the world.

3501
08:05:26,540 --> 08:05:30,779
It tastes good, it's not, but it looks like

3502
08:05:30,779 --> 08:05:43,819
a catcher's mitt. Lasagna.

3503
08:05:43,819 --> 08:05:52,220
Garfield, what have you done? What if your mother made you lasagna? Would you say it looked

3504
08:05:52,220 --> 08:05:58,639
like cat puke? No, I would eat it and I think it was delicious. Guys,

3505
08:05:58,639 --> 08:06:02,639
it's pasta sheets, a bunch of cheese, and a ton of

3506
08:06:02,639 --> 08:06:09,419
sauce. That doesn't taste bad. What's, there's nothing wrong

3507
08:06:09,419 --> 08:06:17,419
with it. It's, that's all it is. It's pizza

3508
08:06:17,419 --> 08:06:24,220
with dough or your bread. At least we don't eat canned tuna. I'm banning

3509
08:06:24,220 --> 08:06:29,099
this guy. How do I do that? I just gifted them a

3510
08:06:29,099 --> 08:06:49,470
sub. Alright, hold on. Yeah, I get fucking banned.

3511
08:06:49,470 --> 08:07:15,709
Yeah, I get banned. Like, that's really close to ban person.

3512
08:07:15,709 --> 08:07:20,139
There's like, add friend, whisper, gift a sub, and then like

3513
08:07:20,139 --> 08:07:24,139
right there is also ban. Like, ban is not even

3514
08:07:24,139 --> 08:07:41,950
two inches away from gift sub. Alright, now I'm actually, now I'm gonna ban you.

3515
08:07:41,950 --> 08:07:49,369
I'm gonna get banned for like a day. Alright, it's time to go. I gotta get

3516
08:07:49,369 --> 08:07:53,610
ahead of here. Lasagna tastes great, it's delicious, it's wonderful.

3517
08:07:53,610 --> 08:07:59,950
It's just, it's not on Italian menu. It's on

3518
08:07:59,950 --> 08:08:04,439
Olive Garden and like Friday's secret menu. You gotta order from the secret

3519
08:08:04,439 --> 08:08:10,540
menu. German, please laugh, please. Just pretend laugh at my joke.

3520
08:08:10,540 --> 08:08:14,840
I need your Boston laughs. What was the joke?

3521
08:08:14,840 --> 08:08:26,250
Wait, what are you spamming this for? You can take the sub back.

3522
08:08:26,250 --> 08:08:30,250
I can't take the sub back. I'm not gonna ban you. I'm just, why

3523
08:08:30,250 --> 08:08:36,159
would I ban you? Did I just give you like a three month sub?

3524
08:08:36,159 --> 08:08:43,659
Wow, okay, I'm loud, alright.

3525
08:08:43,659 --> 08:08:55,500
Just, I did it. Subway isn't going under.

3526
08:08:55,500 --> 08:09:03,880
It's gonna happen. Does that work? German 95 is gifted a, no

3527
08:09:03,880 --> 08:09:08,830
it was tier one. I see it in my streamlabs. More like

3528
08:09:08,830 --> 08:09:15,500
Uglyma985.

3529
08:09:15,500 --> 08:09:20,759
Like that. Hey QWWQ4, thanks for the one dollar.

3530
08:09:20,759 --> 08:09:25,200
They say meatball, what is this? This is not a real website. Hey Dork Cube

3531
08:09:25,200 --> 08:09:29,200
thanks for the one dollar. Get fucked. Lasagna Classico for the goddamn win.

3532
08:09:29,200 --> 08:09:33,200
I didn't, I like lasagna. This is just, this is

3533
08:09:33,200 --> 08:09:37,200
a bullshit article that was written about me in chat how I don't like lasagna.

3534
08:09:37,200 --> 08:09:41,200
I said it was delicious, I said it was full of delicious flavors, and then I love,

3535
08:09:41,200 --> 08:09:48,509
I would eat it. When did I ever say that? Hey Zazzasalt,

3536
08:09:48,509 --> 08:09:52,509
thanks for the one dollar. A while ago you mentioned wanting a short co-op game to play with italics.

3537
08:09:52,509 --> 08:09:56,509
I recommend Monaco. What's yours is mine. It's a co-op heist game

3538
08:09:56,509 --> 08:10:04,650
that I think would be great stream material. I've actually heard of that

3539
08:10:04,650 --> 08:10:10,680
game. We were looking at stuff recently. Some PS3

3540
08:10:10,680 --> 08:10:14,680
stuff maybe we could do together. Cause we have all these old consoles.

3541
08:10:14,680 --> 08:10:18,680
But Dork Cube thanks for the one dollar. You're making me mad mister. Stop saying Garfield isn't real.

3542
08:10:18,680 --> 08:10:23,310
I thought this was a lasagna thing again. Alright, look at the source.

3543
08:10:23,310 --> 08:10:31,200
Zazzasalt says someone's mom made this and now she's crying. But did you

3544
08:10:31,200 --> 08:10:35,369
not hear my statement about how all lasagna

3545
08:10:35,369 --> 08:10:39,369
looks like that? Gordon Ramsey could make a lasagna.

3546
08:10:39,369 --> 08:10:43,869
And it would still look like that. That's just what lasagna is.

3547
08:10:43,869 --> 08:10:58,540
It's just a ton of layered sheets of pasta and

3548
08:10:58,540 --> 08:11:04,569
sauce all over it with a shit load of cheese stuffed in it.

3549
08:11:04,569 --> 08:11:10,540
I'll make it on stream. I can do it.

3550
08:11:10,540 --> 08:11:14,540
Last two here, thank you Juno. Scepto over the three bucks.

3551
08:11:14,540 --> 08:11:18,540
Thanks for the stream. I don't know why I couldn't stop laughing at a man literally not talking or remoting

3552
08:11:18,540 --> 08:11:23,610
over for ten minutes. It was hard. But thank you.

3553
08:11:23,610 --> 08:11:27,610
Glad to have you. QWWQ4 thanks for the one dollar. It's the

3554
08:11:27,610 --> 08:11:32,299
menu for Spaghetti Warehouse. Don't be mean to lasagna.

3555
08:11:32,299 --> 08:11:41,630
Lasagna. But thank you guys. Let's take a look at the

3556
08:11:41,630 --> 08:11:46,060
video. There's going to be a shit load of subs that scroll up here really fast. Cause as you know

3557
08:11:46,060 --> 08:11:50,680
there were a ton of community subs. And here they come.

3558
08:11:50,680 --> 08:11:56,139
Thank you everybody. General please tell me a bedtime story that will help me sleep.

3559
08:11:56,139 --> 08:12:00,810
Once there was a young prince

3560
08:12:00,810 --> 08:12:06,400
that lived in a castle. He was really

3561
08:12:06,400 --> 08:12:10,700
really good at Fortnite. So one day he got the

3562
08:12:10,700 --> 08:12:19,360
Victory Royale in Fortnite. I'm really rusty on these aren't I?

3563
08:12:19,360 --> 08:12:37,450
Mentioning Fortnite. I said Fortnite and it threw me off.

3564
08:12:37,450 --> 08:12:46,240
This is lagging. It's going so fast. That was a shitty story. Tell us a better one.

3565
08:12:46,240 --> 08:12:52,889
It was a shitty story. Blah blah blah blah blah.

3566
08:12:52,889 --> 08:12:58,090
It was a shitty story. Blah blah blah. You want a better one? Fine.

3567
08:12:58,090 --> 08:13:03,040
How about this one? This one's called...

3568
08:13:03,040 --> 08:13:07,040
I'm just going to come up with more than a fly here.

3569
08:13:07,040 --> 08:13:11,580
Okay so you got a... Okay how about...

3570
08:13:11,580 --> 08:13:16,509
I got a decent one. We got a

3571
08:13:16,509 --> 08:13:20,509
small one cause we were just doing stuff about animals. A fawn was

3572
08:13:20,509 --> 08:13:24,509
racing in the forest. He was ahead of a rabbit.

3573
08:13:24,509 --> 08:13:28,880
He was very fast coming through. He was ahead of the elephant.

3574
08:13:28,880 --> 08:13:32,880
The fawn is faster than the elephant. The fawn is faster than the rabbit.

3575
08:13:32,880 --> 08:13:36,880
He leapt and cleared the stream. He ran past

3576
08:13:36,880 --> 08:13:41,560
the crumbling wall of dirt. There was a large boulder on the

3577
08:13:41,560 --> 08:13:45,560
grassy plain. He stumbled and fell down.

3578
08:13:45,560 --> 08:13:49,560
He burst into tears and the monkey massaged his leg.

3579
08:13:49,560 --> 08:13:53,560
Tears flowed from the fawn's eyes.

3580
08:13:53,560 --> 08:13:57,560
The brother bear picked him up. The fawn didn't stop crying. His mother came.

3581
08:13:57,560 --> 08:14:02,509
She said, look we'll beat up this bad boulder. The fawn said, oh don't

3582
08:14:02,509 --> 08:14:06,509
do that. Then the boulder will also start crying. His mother laughed. So did the fawn.

3583
08:14:06,509 --> 08:14:16,639
That's the story. Ten more community subs just came in.

3584
08:14:16,639 --> 08:14:24,830
What's the moral of the story? I don't know. You don't have any fucking idea what the moral of

3585
08:14:24,830 --> 08:14:32,200
this story is. It's a cute story that's told by some kid or something. I don't know.

3586
08:14:32,200 --> 08:14:38,919
Amscoots, ten community subs. Thank you Amscoots.

3587
08:14:38,919 --> 08:14:47,950
Really appreciate it. It's a lot. Was this story generated by an AI?

3588
08:14:47,950 --> 08:14:53,840
I don't think so. And those of you that want to like

3589
08:14:53,840 --> 08:14:58,720
this is a children's book right? Was my book better than this book?

3590
08:14:58,720 --> 08:15:05,119
This book, this is a book. This book was originally published.

3591
08:15:05,119 --> 08:15:11,319
This is a published book. This is exactly what I have to say.

3592
08:15:11,319 --> 08:15:15,319
The person just did the, they did fawn racing

3593
08:15:15,319 --> 08:15:24,040
in forest and then they made this up. They had the random number

3594
08:15:24,040 --> 08:15:35,500
generator. Are you still on the children's book joke? Yeah, then we've been going

3595
08:15:35,500 --> 08:15:40,639
this whole time. I've been streaming for like four days straight.

3596
08:15:40,639 --> 08:15:48,459
I've written like five books. But that's gonna be it. Thank you

3597
08:15:48,459 --> 08:15:52,459
everybody for hanging out. Again, I'm not entirely sure

3598
08:15:52,459 --> 08:15:56,459
what tomorrow is going to hold. So

3599
08:15:56,459 --> 08:16:00,459
tentative that I'll be live tomorrow. But the next time that I am live, whether it's

3600
08:16:00,459 --> 08:16:04,889
tomorrow or a day from now, we will be doing

3601
08:16:04,889 --> 08:16:08,889
live. I'm gonna get into it. I'm gonna get started. I'll see you when I see you.

3602
08:16:08,889 --> 08:16:12,889
The sus is probably gonna be weird or inaccurate for a day or two.

3603
08:16:12,889 --> 08:16:18,590
So I'll be here tomorrow afternoon to let you guys know what's happening.

3604
08:16:18,590 --> 08:16:22,590
So regardless if I stream or not tomorrow, I'll be here at around like

3605
08:16:22,590 --> 08:16:27,020
2, 2.30 tomorrow just to let everybody know what's gonna happen. Or maybe I'll make a

3606
08:16:27,020 --> 08:16:32,029
tweet or something. Just check my socials, you know. Have a great night.

3607
08:16:32,029 --> 08:16:36,029
Thanks for hanging out. This is Blast as always. See you guys soon.
