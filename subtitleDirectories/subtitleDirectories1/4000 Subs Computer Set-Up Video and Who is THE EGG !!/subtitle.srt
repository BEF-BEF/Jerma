00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:07,660
Oh, hello, cats. Hey, what's going on, guys? It's Gerber here for the 4,000 subscriber video.

2
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:15,050
This is my dog, Simon. He's a dachshund. He's like 17 years old. He's really, oh yes, hello, hello.

3
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:18,809
He can go down. But, uh, thank you guys so much. I got a couple of things in this video you guys

4
00:00:18,809 --> 00:00:26,379
gonna like. I've got a setup video and I have a crazy kind of cooking show. But hopefully you

5
00:00:26,379 --> 00:00:34,020
guys enjoy it. I really do appreciate the 4,000. Let's keep rolling, everybody. All right, so this

6
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:39,640
is my desk. I'll give you like a nice wide shot of the desk. So there's the desk, there's the monitor,

7
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:45,640
there's my chair. The desk is kind of messy, so I apologize. I didn't really have time to clean it

8
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:52,200
up before I made this video. But anyways, the computer is under the desk. It's lit, it's all

9
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:58,520
lit up blue and stuff, nice and cool. So that is the computer. The specs on this thing, it is a

10
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:04,120
custom-built Digital Storm PC. Highly recommend Digital Storm. If you guys don't know what Digital

11
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:12,010
Storm is, go find out. They're awesome. So it is an Intel i7-950 and it's overclocked to 3.6

12
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:22,950
gigahertz. It has 6 gigs of RAM at 1600 megahertz. It is a, oh, it has a Nvidia GTX 470, the super

13
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:32,579
clocked EVGA edition. Shibby will like that. And it also has a one terabyte, I believe, one terabyte

14
00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:39,269
32 MB cache hard drive. I think it's a Western Digital, I think. Here's the monitor. It is a

15
00:01:39,269 --> 00:01:48,569
27 inch monitor made by HP, the HP 2710M. It's a very, very nice monitor, nice and glossy, nice

16
00:01:48,569 --> 00:01:54,200
finish. I really enjoy it. So that's kind of my computer setup. Oh, I also, here's my external

17
00:01:54,200 --> 00:02:00,840
hard drive right there. I have it plugged in with eSATA. I don't have it plugged in with a USB

18
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:06,709
because eSATA is faster and more efficient. And yeah, that's pretty much my computer setup.

19
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:12,860
Hope you guys enjoy that. And now let's make some breakfast. All right. So we're here in the kitchen.

20
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:17,979
I'm going to cook you guys an American classic. This is the two eggs, two pieces of bacon,

21
00:02:17,979 --> 00:02:21,979
two pieces of toast. Cause a lot of guys ask me, they say, Jerma, how do you stay so healthy?

22
00:02:21,979 --> 00:02:26,860
How do you stay so physically fit? Like how, what can I do to get healthy? Besides exercise and

23
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:30,699
besides obviously keeping a good diet, you want a good breakfast. Now let's start out by talking

24
00:02:30,699 --> 00:02:34,939
about the bacon. Bacon, you want premium cut. You don't want any of the gross, bad stuff. You

25
00:02:34,939 --> 00:02:42,599
want the good stuff. Two eggs, two pieces of toast. And we're going to start. There's only one egg in

26
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:46,840
here. All right. Let's just go to the store real quick. Yeah. I'll go. Just, uh, it's, uh, the

27
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:56,580
supermarket's open, right? Yep. Did someone ask for an egg? Oh, it's the egg. Oh, all right. Come on

28
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:02,169
in, bro. Let's, let's do this. This is, uh, this is the egg. For those of you that don't know,

29
00:03:02,169 --> 00:03:05,530
this is the egg. He's a really good friend of mine. He's been here for a long time.

30
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:10,969
Um, he had a crazy accident at some point in his life. I don't know when it was, but he, uh,

31
00:03:10,969 --> 00:03:15,530
he turned into this and, uh, I mean, I don't, I don't know why I'm introducing you. You could

32
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:25,860
potentially do this yourself, but, uh, the egg. Um, I'm trying to do a healthy, like American

33
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:35,060
iPad. I kinda, I kinda only wanted to be honest. I wanted just like a few eggs. Like I only wanted

34
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:44,039
like two eggs. You can never have too many eggs. Um, you gotta tell me you're the egg expert. So

35
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:48,039
you gotta tell me if this is true. Is it true that the egg yolk is like the unhealthy part?

36
00:03:48,039 --> 00:03:55,180
Don't you really want to cook like the egg whites and... In the military radium, we only cook

37
00:03:55,180 --> 00:04:11,939
hybrid goat and chicken egg. Okay. So what does that have to do with anything? This is not how

38
00:04:11,939 --> 00:04:16,819
you cook eggs. I don't know where you, where you figured this was a good idea. Whoever told you

39
00:04:16,819 --> 00:04:21,930
this was a good idea was completely wrong. Everybody, everyone thinks this is funny. What

40
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:26,089
are you, what are you doing? So I, I mean, I, I at least want to add a little bit of bacon because

41
00:04:26,089 --> 00:04:36,259
if bacon is... Not only egg. All right. The egg has, uh, has officially left us. Uh, I don't know

42
00:04:36,259 --> 00:04:41,060
where he went. He just took off. He like stormed out of the kitchen. I don't understand, but I'm

43
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:46,899
going to try and fix this breakfast because this is an atrocity. Thank you, egg. You, uh, thanks

44
00:04:46,899 --> 00:04:52,980
for bringing me extra eggs. I appreciate it, but you, um, obviously have a few problems in your life

45
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:58,100
you need to deal with. And that's something that you can figure out on your own. Okay. So it has

46
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:04,420
been a painfully long time since the egg has left and to be completely honest, I'm getting kind of

47
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:19,139
concerned. So, um, did you hear that? That is the shower. That is the shower. Egg. Egg. Shh. I knew,

48
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:21,860
I knew this was going to happen, dude. Watch out. Watch out. Get out of the way. Watch out.

49
00:05:22,579 --> 00:05:43,399
You all right, egg? It's time for you to go home. Okay. You gotta, you gotta go home.

50
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:48,069
See you later, egg. When you're out of the shower, get out of here. Okay. Leave the house.

51
00:05:51,939 --> 00:05:56,980
So thank you everybody for 4,000 subscribers. You guys are awesome. I hope you guys enjoyed this
