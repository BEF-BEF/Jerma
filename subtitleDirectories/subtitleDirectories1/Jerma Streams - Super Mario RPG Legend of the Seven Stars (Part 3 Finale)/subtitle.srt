00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:16,100
Hello, good afternoon. How are you? I'm doing good. I'm doing good.

2
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:42,299
All right, I need to address something very, very quickly right off the bat. At the very beginning of this stream. I said a while back long time ago, that they would never be at sands would never be an undertale and I guaranteed it.

3
00:00:43,179 --> 00:01:03,229
So now I have to eat a shoe. I don't know what kind of shoe it has to be. I just I know that I said I was going to eat a full shoe on stream if sands was confirmed and shoot he was last yesterday.

4
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:12,659
I mean smash.

5
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:24,540
It's Smash Brothers. Yeah. Oh, no, no, sands is an undertale. What a surprise that is.

6
00:01:28,659 --> 00:01:34,340
And I mean like crap. Hey, Jolo. Thanks for the five community subs.

7
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:43,709
Eat a Jordan. Yeah, someone will find a clip of me saying I will eat a shoe.

8
00:01:44,269 --> 00:02:28,050
Yep. But thanks for the five subs. And so the shoe eating stream will be on March 12 2020. Mark it on your calendar. I ain't gonna eat a fucking shoe on stream. Anyways, how you doing today? Yeah, so sands is from undertale is in Smash Brothers. We actually talked about this last night. And that's okay. Cool. That's really I couldn't I could never imagine.

9
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:59,469
Wow. Oh, that's pretty interesting. He is although he's a me costume. So I think that means I only have to eat 50% of the shoe. You know what I'm saying? I can cut it in half, right? You just eat a sock instead.

10
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:09,870
No, I ain't eating any clothes. Imagine like I eat a fucking shoe and I got to have to go to the doctor.

11
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:17,620
What seems to be the trouble? Jeremy? Um, well, you know, sands from undertale, right?

12
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:29,250
Oh, it's my favorite. Yeah. Let me guess. You bet that he wouldn't be in Smash. Me too. And he like shows an x-ray of his stomach and he's got a shoe in there too.

13
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:41,280
And I'm like, Doc, oh, damn, geez, what are you serious? He's like, I know, right? And I'm like, why did you eat the whole shoe? And he's looks at me. He's like, what do you mean? Why do we need to eat the whole shoe? He's a me costume.

14
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:49,919
Oh shit. And like, then he holds up my x-ray and I got a half a shoe in there. We both laugh. And then I make a lifelong friend. So I'm okay with that.

15
00:03:57,889 --> 00:04:09,740
Anyways, we're gonna do more Mario RPG Legend of the seven stars. The final is the finale is gonna be the last stream of this game because we're probably gonna get to the end.

16
00:04:10,699 --> 00:04:29,180
Now, this stream of Mario might be like, it might be three hours to finish this. It might be six. And I say, Oh, you're right. I do have I do have another story for you. But another another story. But I had a few dreams.

17
00:04:29,819 --> 00:04:38,540
And one of them is really, really weird. And I need some I need some people in the chat to try to explain to me what the fuck this dream meant, because it is outrageous. Okay.

18
00:04:39,500 --> 00:05:06,050
So I fall asleep. And my brain tends to do this thing. When I go to bed, where I if I wake up and let's let's let's back up. I gotta back way the fuck up for this. If I go to sleep for more than three or four hours, and wake up for some reason, whether it's I have to I got a pee or something or like, oh, I just kind of rolled over or you know, any reason.

19
00:05:07,009 --> 00:05:34,000
I will fall back asleep, like six more times. Each one of those times that I fall back asleep, I'll wake up fall back asleep, I wake up, there is a new episode of dream TV on every single time. Number one, why does that happen? It was just boom, boom, boom, new episode TV new episode, you're changing channels.

20
00:05:36,980 --> 00:06:04,879
Anyways, the first dream was terrifying. It was fucking scary as all hell. So I'm in the backyard of some I don't know where I was, some friend's house, somebody said that that that kind of detail don't matter. There was a barbecue. It was me and friends and maybe his family cool. Well, we're in the backyard, it's grills going. And in the distance above, all the way up in the sky.

21
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:36,930
If something was something was strange about the sky, I'm like, what's going on sky? Something's what you know, when you just know, in a dream that something bad is gonna happen. Nothing happened yet. I'm just like looking at the sky. Oh, something's wrong up there. No, there's not. Why do you know that? Why is your brain giving you a spoiler? Before it happens. Anyways, about five to 10 seconds later, in my dream reality, giant fucking boulders were tiny, tiny, tiny in the sky, like three, four, five, six of them at a time.

22
00:06:37,329 --> 00:06:37,980
And these things have rapidly falling towards Earth. And I'm just like, those, those are really far away, but they're coming in real quick. I think I should probably run. Because those are getting bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger. If they were going like 600,000 miles per hour. And I'm just like fucking I start sprinting, sprinting to my left boulder is flying down just takes up the entire sky at this point and like crash to my right. And I like just

23
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:25,069
barely Super Mario and out of the way. Two more like blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, like asteroid fucking raining hell. More of them come. I look up I'm safe. No, I'm not. What the wall with this board like seven more like starting to come into picture. I look

24
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:39,529
forward. Otto is right in front of me. And I'm like, wait, Otto, Otto, and he starts running towards me. And I'm like, and I go to pick him up and I scoop him up and boom. Another

25
00:07:39,529 --> 00:08:09,879
asteroid lands right where I just picked him up. But I'm like, we just barely got away. I'm running around with Otto like this fucking asteroids landing everywhere. I'm doing like all these jumps, like double jumps and shit to get away from them. I ended up lying on my back with Otto. And like QTE cutscene scenario, where it's like, there's one, roll left, left. There's another one roll right. Ow, my hand. There's another one roll right. I'm doing QTE is looking at the sky. It was freaking me the fuck out. I woke up.

26
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:12,360
That was weird.

27
00:08:14,439 --> 00:08:22,889
Oh, everybody okay? Oh, yeah, I guess. Yeah. Hold on. Let me go. I got some water. I had a drink. Okay.

28
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:42,000
That was good. That was weird. Good night. Back to bed. I changed channel. I wake up. And there's a device in front of me. This device. We had had two cylinders in the top. And in the middle was some machine some kind of machine. I don't know what the fuck it was.

29
00:08:42,850 --> 00:09:01,519
But it was a machine that processed your piss. And I knew that I knew what the machine was. And what this thing did is it processed your piss not by a computer, but it got sent to my Reddit for them to process and tell me what illnesses I have.

30
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:34,639
So this device is you're supposed to pee like into it like a pee collector, pour it in. And my red like Reddit will tell me like give me like a spreadsheet of all the fucking illnesses I have. So I'm supposed to I am supposed to be doing this. Oh, I guess I'm this is what I have to do today. Yeah, I'm doing that. I go I need I want to know some things. But I don't want like Reddit to know. Like, but I don't know what but that's like kind of personal.

31
00:09:34,639 --> 00:10:13,960
So, so Otto just peed into the cup, and gave it to me. Like I just took it from him. And I poured Otto's pee in there. Like, hey, guys, coming in my pee. Here's my here it is. And they like Reddit started to decipher all these problems that I had. And they were like comment threads about, man, this is like kind of weird. This doesn't seem like anything that we've ever seen here before on Reddit, like on the German Reddit. And I'm like, Oh, oh, they know it's dog pee. What do I do?

32
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:49,629
Like, I didn't want them to know that like, it was like this weird social thing where like, it's like a social media thing. And I was trying to like circumvent the me doing this. I have no idea. So then, then I this is where it gets weird. So like, I go, oh, let me try it again. And I don't know why I don't look, you can't explain why you do things in dreams, but you just do.

33
00:10:50,429 --> 00:11:08,629
So this time, because people were starting to get a little like, Oh, what's going on here? This isn't this. I don't think this is your pee. I did like half dog pee. And then I just took I just took peed directly into the tube at the same time. And I like hoping that that was going to solve that problem.

34
00:11:08,629 --> 00:11:52,820
I then I woke up. Oh, I have to pee in the thing was Oh, that was weird. Strange. Oh, okay. Time to look at water. Okay. That's better. Time to go back to bed. Change channel again. This one I don't remember that much. I have no must no memory of this one. All I remember is I was a blacksmith. That's it. I don't know anything else. I don't I don't know what I was doing.

35
00:11:59,159 --> 00:12:02,220
what I was doing, what I was making.

36
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:05,500
But I had this big, it was like a butcher's,

37
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:10,320
it was like a butcher's cape.

38
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,919
And it was like all butchery.

39
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:14,769
And I had like big butcher gloves on.

40
00:12:14,769 --> 00:12:17,889
And I was like making, I was making something for somebody

41
00:12:17,889 --> 00:12:23,000
in my like blacksmithing store.

42
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:29,629
And then I woke up and the sun was out.

43
00:12:29,629 --> 00:12:34,360
I don't, I, that's three separate TV shows

44
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:38,320
that I jumped into halfway through the episode.

45
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,639
Like I walked in on a friend or a roommate

46
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:46,159
watching the end of a movie three times.

47
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:48,299
Like the culmination, the asteroids are falling.

48
00:12:48,299 --> 00:12:52,850
Here's the big climax of that movie.

49
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:54,929
Dreams don't make any sense.

50
00:12:54,929 --> 00:12:57,450
No one will ever be able to tell us what they actually are.

51
00:12:57,450 --> 00:13:00,779
Ever.

52
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:01,620
No one.

53
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:03,980
I don't care if, you know, if you want to explain it

54
00:13:05,299 --> 00:13:07,980
spiritually or scientifically.

55
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:08,820
What the fuck?

56
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:11,240
Why does that happen?

57
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,299
Why can't we like see inside of our own heads

58
00:13:13,299 --> 00:13:23,559
when we're sleeping?

59
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:29,379
I don't know.

60
00:13:29,379 --> 00:13:30,779
To be a black, to see a blacksmith in your dream

61
00:13:30,779 --> 00:13:32,700
represents inner strength and endurance.

62
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:35,139
Perhaps the dream is telling you that you need

63
00:13:35,139 --> 00:13:36,820
to strike while the fire is hot

64
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:38,779
or act while you have the opportunity.

65
00:13:43,139 --> 00:13:43,980
Okay.

66
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:47,440
What does asteroids falling into earth mean?

67
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:55,230
Help me out here.

68
00:13:55,230 --> 00:14:03,169
Holy shit, somebody gave a lot of money.

69
00:14:03,169 --> 00:14:03,990
Holy shit.

70
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:05,850
All right, we had, I was too,

71
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:08,490
I was too locked into telling my dreams.

72
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:13,929
But we had, Germa lied about eating a shoe

73
00:14:13,929 --> 00:14:15,490
thanks to five community subs.

74
00:14:16,009 --> 00:14:17,129
Definitely, that's absolutely a lie.

75
00:14:17,129 --> 00:14:18,730
So I'm glad you made that account.

76
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:21,000
Thanks for the five subs.

77
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,879
And MVM Matt gave a hundred dollars, 10,000 bits.

78
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:32,950
Thank you MVM Matt for the 10,000 bits, 100 bucks.

79
00:14:35,259 --> 00:14:38,990
Huge amount of fucking money.

80
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:40,789
Hey, Germa, I've been watching you for five years.

81
00:14:40,789 --> 00:14:42,909
You've gotten me through some tough times in my life.

82
00:14:42,909 --> 00:14:44,549
And you always have been the funniest person

83
00:14:44,549 --> 00:14:45,990
I've seen on the internet.

84
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:50,279
Never stopped being you.

85
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:52,039
Thank you for the incredibly kind message, Matt.

86
00:14:52,039 --> 00:14:53,679
And thanks for the hundred bucks.

87
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,399
I only know how to be me.

88
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:57,440
I don't know how to be anybody else.

89
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,080
So I don't think that'll change.

90
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:04,190
But thank you.

91
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:07,210
Really appreciate that.

92
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:08,570
To see an asteroid in your dream

93
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:10,289
represents a spiritual message from above.

94
00:15:10,289 --> 00:15:12,929
You're about to be enlightened with some knowledge.

95
00:15:12,929 --> 00:15:14,850
Alternatively, it signifies a brainstorming

96
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:16,169
of ideas and thoughts.

97
00:15:16,169 --> 00:15:18,450
If the asteroid hits the earth,

98
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:20,649
then it indicates that your idealistic notions

99
00:15:20,649 --> 00:15:27,210
are deteriorating or being shattered apart.

100
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:31,840
Which one of those things confirms sans for smash?

101
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:32,840
All right, what about peeing?

102
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:35,820
Okay, what about, good luck with this one.

103
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:39,779
Peeing into a device that Reddit will tell you

104
00:15:39,779 --> 00:15:41,419
what illnesses you have.

105
00:15:41,419 --> 00:15:42,940
Being embarrassed about that

106
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:45,419
and having your dog pee go in there instead.

107
00:15:45,419 --> 00:15:48,340
And then mixing your pee and your dog's pee

108
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:49,940
in there to try to throw them off.

109
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:56,269
What does that one mean?

110
00:15:56,269 --> 00:15:58,110
Another hundred bucks just came in.

111
00:15:58,110 --> 00:16:03,820
This is from Phylactery Lich.

112
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:05,740
Thank you Phylactery for the hundred bucks back to back.

113
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:06,980
It's okay, Germa.

114
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:11,340
I also have weird dream episodes sometimes.

115
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:12,500
They can be weird.

116
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,580
Dreams, I dream, dreams, I,

117
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:17,950
you ever get to the point where you have a dream

118
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:20,429
and you don't want to dream

119
00:16:20,429 --> 00:16:24,269
and you'll do everything possible to get out of the dream?

120
00:16:24,269 --> 00:16:25,909
Wanna know what works for me?

121
00:16:25,909 --> 00:16:27,230
If you really wanna get out of a dream,

122
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:29,909
this is real knowledge that I'm gonna drop on you here.

123
00:16:29,909 --> 00:16:33,070
This is a secret recipe to get the fuck out of a nightmare.

124
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:36,559
You wanna know how to do it?

125
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:42,200
You close your eyes tight and open them.

126
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,799
If you blink, if you make,

127
00:16:43,799 --> 00:16:46,159
if you blink in a dream tightly,

128
00:16:46,159 --> 00:16:48,080
if you go close your eyes tight, tight, tight,

129
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:52,679
close your eyes, close your eyes tight, you'll get up.

130
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:55,240
In the dream, if you do that, do that consciously,

131
00:16:55,240 --> 00:17:05,720
close your eyes, blink, blink, blink, you'll get up.

132
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,000
I just tried that, it works.

133
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,279
See, welcome back to reality.

134
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:20,819
I'm talking to the mods at the speed run academy.

135
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:22,900
We determined you've broken too many rules for this run

136
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:25,019
so we cannot use this for the archive.

137
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:27,740
Oh, thanks.

138
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:29,339
Thanks for the heads up.

139
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:31,059
Thank you, though, to the both back to back

140
00:17:31,059 --> 00:17:34,299
hundred dollar donations in 10,000 bits.

141
00:17:34,299 --> 00:17:36,180
By the way, I do have to say it

142
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,940
because I'm a live streamer, okay?

143
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:40,700
I'm a live streamer, therefore I have to say this.

144
00:17:43,299 --> 00:17:45,380
No, fuck it, I ain't gonna say it.

145
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:48,180
No, you've already heard it a thousand times.

146
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:50,619
Why do I need to be the person to tell you this?

147
00:17:54,319 --> 00:17:57,039
Every single live stream, okay, I'll give you a hint.

148
00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:01,039
Every stream you have watched, every single one

149
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:05,329
in the last like four or five days has said this word

150
00:18:05,329 --> 00:18:06,410
and told you about it.

151
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:14,240
So this is just redundant information by this point.

152
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:21,769
Sans isn't smashed yet, that's the last I'm talking about.

153
00:18:21,769 --> 00:18:24,079
I'll give you another hint.

154
00:18:24,079 --> 00:18:27,160
It is partnered up with a failing company

155
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:32,319
that's closing all their stores.

156
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:42,559
Take a guess.

157
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:48,119
No, I can't, he hates this, no, I'm just saying.

158
00:18:49,099 --> 00:18:51,920
When was the last time you went into one?

159
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:55,319
I haven't been in one, I'm just being real.

160
00:18:55,319 --> 00:19:01,589
I'm being realistic.

161
00:19:01,589 --> 00:19:19,250
Yesterday, I'm just being real a day ago.

162
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:20,549
Hey, who are you?

163
00:19:20,549 --> 00:19:32,109
You can't just barge in here.

164
00:19:32,109 --> 00:19:33,309
What is he talking about?

165
00:19:34,269 --> 00:19:36,349
What the fuck is he talking about?

166
00:19:36,349 --> 00:19:40,829
All right, everybody settle down for a minute.

167
00:19:40,829 --> 00:19:45,359
I'm about to, here we go.

168
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:48,720
Over the course of September, if you're a new sub,

169
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:55,480
your tier one subscription will be 50% off.

170
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:05,789
Partnering up with Subway to,

171
00:20:05,789 --> 00:20:08,430
I'm actually, I'm not entirely sure what they're doing

172
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:14,259
and why it's with Subway.

173
00:20:14,259 --> 00:20:16,259
It's only if it's your first time subbing

174
00:20:16,259 --> 00:20:19,190
and I don't think community subs do it either.

175
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:20,710
Why is it Subway?

176
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:22,630
Do you get like a Subway sandwich or something?

177
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:23,470
I don't get it.

178
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:33,640
Beginning September 3rd at 1 p.m.

179
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,920
In partnership with Subway,

180
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,920
we're offering 50% off new tier one subscription.

181
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:41,420
But what is Subway doing?

182
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:43,299
I'm actually curious.

183
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,579
Was it just there?

184
00:20:45,579 --> 00:20:48,599
Are they?

185
00:20:48,599 --> 00:20:53,700
Oh, don't forget those bonus bits.

186
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,900
Subway is throwing in 10% more bits

187
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,819
when you cheer 10 or more.

188
00:20:57,819 --> 00:20:59,180
Thanks to Subway.

189
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:01,940
Subway will be gifting subscriptions to various channels.

190
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:04,380
Make sure to tune in of who they gift a sub to

191
00:21:05,819 --> 00:21:08,740
and tune in when Subway launches their own Twitch channel.

192
00:21:10,369 --> 00:21:14,609
Wait, why is, what?

193
00:21:14,609 --> 00:21:21,670
Why is Subway making a Twitch channel?

194
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:23,549
Is this like the great rebranding

195
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:25,230
of like 2020?

196
00:21:33,869 --> 00:21:37,509
All right, I gotta play Mario RPG.

197
00:21:37,509 --> 00:21:39,869
Jerma, why don't you get sponsorships?

198
00:21:39,869 --> 00:21:40,710
I don't know.

199
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:44,970
Rewind fucking five minutes.

200
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:53,000
All right, so the last thing we did,

201
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,319
we've been told that Mallow

202
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:01,519
is not a frog

203
00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:05,319
and that Mallow is in fact a giant bird who's in here.

204
00:22:05,319 --> 00:22:07,119
So who's the fucking faker is what I,

205
00:22:07,119 --> 00:22:08,039
I'm in a weird mood today.

206
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:14,400
I can already tell you that.

207
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:18,519
So now, what was the actual, okay, I gotta go, let's talk.

208
00:22:18,519 --> 00:22:20,519
I used to work in the castle.

209
00:22:20,519 --> 00:22:23,079
You should see the way she hits poor Dodo.

210
00:22:23,079 --> 00:22:27,299
What a horrible wife he must have.

211
00:22:27,299 --> 00:22:31,599
All right, did I buy anything from here?

212
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:32,759
Say, you had thought I'm looking for something

213
00:22:32,759 --> 00:22:33,599
to look in your eye.

214
00:22:33,599 --> 00:22:34,440
What can I do for you?

215
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,900
I think I already bought stuff, right?

216
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:44,089
Yeah, Mega Glove Warfam, he already got it.

217
00:22:44,089 --> 00:22:48,009
What was I doing here?

218
00:22:48,009 --> 00:22:49,450
I forget the next part of this.

219
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:52,170
Wait, what was the last thing I did?

220
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:54,680
Used to be so small, now look at him.

221
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,240
How do we get into that castle?

222
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,140
I gotta remember this.

223
00:22:58,140 --> 00:22:59,660
King Nimbus loves statues and birds.

224
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:01,980
He has scads of them in the castle.

225
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:04,019
You got, I think we have, yeah, I remember.

226
00:23:04,019 --> 00:23:06,220
We gotta talk to like the sculpture person.

227
00:23:08,839 --> 00:23:10,359
You know about the royal bus?

228
00:23:10,359 --> 00:23:11,200
I do actually.

229
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,960
If you read this, I'll give you $50.

230
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:24,599
Okay, just did.

231
00:23:24,599 --> 00:23:28,420
Yeah, I thought, doesn't somebody,

232
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:33,519
I swear that somebody recognizes Mallow here.

233
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,650
Wahoo.

234
00:23:37,170 --> 00:23:43,369
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

235
00:23:43,369 --> 00:23:44,880
Who's that?

236
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,259
Hey, look, it's me.

237
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:49,700
Oh, you mean that, that's King Nimbus

238
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:51,579
when he was young.

239
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:55,400
Huh?

240
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:58,710
What the, who are you?

241
00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:03,759
Hello, my name is Mallow, and this is my friend Mario.

242
00:24:03,759 --> 00:24:07,549
Mallow, so it is you.

243
00:24:07,549 --> 00:24:10,150
My boy, it's been so long, my,

244
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:13,950
you've become a splendid young prince.

245
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:16,470
I'm a prince?

246
00:24:16,509 --> 00:24:18,329
What?

247
00:24:18,329 --> 00:24:32,130
I'm really a prince?

248
00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:38,390
Mario, you're great at impressions.

249
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:41,430
Wow, Mario, that was some mystique level shit there.

250
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:43,390
Yeah, okay, I get it, I guess.

251
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:47,559
You were raised by Frogfuchsia.

252
00:24:47,559 --> 00:24:48,440
There's no question about it,

253
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:53,609
you are without a doubt Prince Mallow.

254
00:24:53,609 --> 00:24:57,420
Mario, look at me, I'm a prince.

255
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:59,380
I knew Valentina was up to something.

256
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:01,259
I just didn't know what.

257
00:25:01,259 --> 00:25:07,339
That must mean that the king really isn't gravely ill.

258
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:08,420
Then let's go inside the castle

259
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:14,569
and save my mother and father, right now.

260
00:25:14,609 --> 00:25:15,650
Hey, who are you?

261
00:25:15,650 --> 00:25:26,289
You can't just barge in here.

262
00:25:26,289 --> 00:25:28,890
Wait, I have an excellent idea.

263
00:25:28,890 --> 00:25:34,990
Get over here.

264
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:36,640
Are you ready?

265
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,289
Yes.

266
00:25:38,289 --> 00:25:39,930
Just stay still for a little while, okay?

267
00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:52,809
It won't take too long.

268
00:25:52,809 --> 00:25:54,470
There.

269
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:58,029
Don't move.

270
00:25:58,029 --> 00:26:01,559
You're gonna be a statue for a little while, okay?

271
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:03,839
Let's get going.

272
00:26:03,839 --> 00:26:07,000
Eternally Gaming just gave $50.

273
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,200
A deal's a deal.

274
00:26:09,319 --> 00:26:10,680
You actually did it.

275
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:14,170
I can't believe you actually did it.

276
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:16,730
Well, I guess that, yeah.

277
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:20,089
That's true, you did.

278
00:26:20,089 --> 00:26:22,509
If you keep, that means I have to eat a shoe.

279
00:26:22,509 --> 00:26:24,470
I don't like people doing the things

280
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:29,119
they say they're gonna do.

281
00:26:29,119 --> 00:26:29,960
But thank you.

282
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:30,799
They say a deal's a deal.

283
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:32,839
Anyway, I gotta say that I think you're a great comedian.

284
00:26:32,839 --> 00:26:34,960
Watching you play games can be painful,

285
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,400
but you're undoubtedly a pioneer in streaming.

286
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:42,400
Love your creativity and talent as a comedian.

287
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:48,819
Well, thank you.

288
00:26:48,819 --> 00:26:49,980
I appreciate that, thanks a lot.

289
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:53,579
If you think that I'm a good comedian,

290
00:26:55,599 --> 00:26:57,559
I hope you have fun.

291
00:26:57,559 --> 00:26:58,920
If you are, then you are.

292
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:01,039
And if you aren't, then I'm sorry.

293
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:03,880
Hopefully you do next time.

294
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:07,079
Painful at video games.

295
00:27:07,079 --> 00:27:11,400
Whatever, I do fine.

296
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,759
I do fine.

297
00:27:13,759 --> 00:27:17,559
I'm doing just fine.

298
00:27:17,559 --> 00:27:18,680
What did you wanna be when you grew up?

299
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:21,279
A magic wand maker.

300
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:24,049
Like from magicians and shit when I was in preschool.

301
00:27:24,049 --> 00:27:26,009
Well, thank you, Eternally Gaming, for the $50,

302
00:27:26,009 --> 00:27:31,890
and yeah, you did hold your word.

303
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:36,140
I'm delivering Valentina's latest order to her.

304
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:38,440
You may enter.

305
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:41,809
Here it goes.

306
00:27:41,809 --> 00:27:47,470
Hey, this doesn't look like Valentina at all.

307
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:50,470
Oh, that's because this is a statue of Valentina's nephew,

308
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:53,670
Mariota, okay?

309
00:27:58,279 --> 00:28:06,990
All right, proceed.

310
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:09,119
There it was.

311
00:28:09,119 --> 00:28:11,759
Remember that noise I was waiting for this whole time?

312
00:28:11,759 --> 00:28:12,599
It just happened.

313
00:28:12,599 --> 00:28:13,599
So everyone thought I was crazy.

314
00:28:13,599 --> 00:28:19,240
I got lots of question marks last time.

315
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,599
Oh, phew, that was close.

316
00:28:20,599 --> 00:28:22,640
I didn't think we could just get through that one.

317
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:25,400
There is no such person named Mariota.

318
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:29,430
Ha ha.

319
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:34,220
There it is, I don't even have to do it.

320
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:36,819
Oh, now this is lovely.

321
00:28:36,819 --> 00:28:40,299
My beauty simply shines forth like the sun.

322
00:28:40,299 --> 00:28:44,210
Only you can make something this stunning.

323
00:28:44,210 --> 00:28:46,700
Thank you, your majesty.

324
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:49,359
I'll be on my way now.

325
00:28:49,359 --> 00:28:52,289
Halt!

326
00:28:52,289 --> 00:28:57,660
What, may I ask, is this ugly thing?

327
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:59,460
Oh, shit!

328
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:00,740
That's my latest masterpiece.

329
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:03,140
I created it just for you.

330
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:07,289
It's called a plumber's lament.

331
00:29:07,289 --> 00:29:08,970
Observe the thick mustache,

332
00:29:08,970 --> 00:29:14,000
covering the sad, innocent smile of a simple fool,

333
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:19,440
and the sideburns conveying his blue-collar roots,

334
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:23,079
and the legs well-defined, strong,

335
00:29:23,079 --> 00:29:25,230
the legs of the masses.

336
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:29,880
Is it to your liking?

337
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,640
Hmm.

338
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,799
I consider myself something of an art buff,

339
00:29:33,799 --> 00:29:38,619
and I've got to say, this is spectacular.

340
00:29:38,619 --> 00:29:41,259
Garo, only you could have created sculptures

341
00:29:41,259 --> 00:29:45,500
with such gentle beauty and raw power.

342
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:47,500
Thank you, your majesty.

343
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:48,619
I'll be on my way now.

344
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:55,009
Wink, wink, nudge.

345
00:29:55,009 --> 00:29:57,579
Spectacular.

346
00:29:57,579 --> 00:29:59,579
Dodo, Dodo!

347
00:29:59,579 --> 00:30:01,059
Don't just sit there like a roast.

348
00:30:01,059 --> 00:30:05,589
Hurry and carry these in.

349
00:30:05,589 --> 00:30:10,660
Dodo, ow.

350
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:27,480
Step on it.

351
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:33,660
Dodo.

352
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:40,279
Oh, I remember this part.

353
00:30:40,279 --> 00:30:44,059
This is the pretend-to-be-the-statue part of the game.

354
00:30:44,059 --> 00:30:52,910
Ha-ha!

355
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:54,109
I love this part, yeah.

356
00:30:54,109 --> 00:31:01,440
This part is just so, it's just, it's so cute.

357
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:07,450
Dodo, did you display the statues properly?

358
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:09,970
Fine, now polish them to a fine luster

359
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:14,450
and make them a tribute to my beauty.

360
00:31:14,450 --> 00:31:15,769
Oh, shit.

361
00:31:15,769 --> 00:31:17,210
Pay attention to me.

362
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:25,640
Hurry up and don't let me catch you dozing again.

363
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:28,960
Uh-oh, Dodo's in a pretty bad mood.

364
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:33,130
Keep up your statue disguise and jump to avoid getting picked.

365
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:34,369
Get ready.

366
00:31:34,369 --> 00:31:35,210
Are you ready?

367
00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:36,529
Yes, he's coming right now.

368
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:48,950
Trump the narrator.

369
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:52,390
He's already, no, I told you the blue is the most.

370
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:04,759
He missed.

371
00:32:23,690 --> 00:32:26,039
Uh-oh, did he catch me?

372
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:44,970
I did it!

373
00:32:44,970 --> 00:32:47,519
Picked up a feather.

374
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:51,579
They believe this is an accessory.

375
00:32:51,579 --> 00:32:56,319
Speed up by 20.

376
00:32:56,319 --> 00:32:57,880
Peach has the EXP booster on.

377
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:03,950
Now, I'm, I'm, I think, I think

378
00:33:04,029 --> 00:33:07,230
that somebody in the party just has to have this on.

379
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:12,920
I don't think it has to be somebody in the actual fight.

380
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:15,799
I'm almost certain of that.

381
00:33:15,799 --> 00:33:19,549
Can somebody confirm with me, please?

382
00:33:19,549 --> 00:33:21,789
Somebody else has played this game five or 600 times

383
00:33:21,789 --> 00:33:33,380
like I have, maybe, fuck you.

384
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:35,059
All right, well, thanks for the help.

385
00:33:35,059 --> 00:33:38,630
And then, I've never played it, okay.

386
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:39,470
Yeah, give it to me.

387
00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:44,049
If you read this, yes.

388
00:33:44,049 --> 00:33:44,890
One guy.

389
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,240
I don't even know what this game is.

390
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:51,160
All right, we're gonna test it.

391
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:53,809
By the way, why is Malo in the party?

392
00:33:53,809 --> 00:33:59,230
That's just, excuse me.

393
00:33:59,230 --> 00:34:00,910
What are you doing in here?

394
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:01,990
So, let's test it out.

395
00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:05,410
The feather also is very, very good.

396
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:06,809
So, Peach can have the feather on.

397
00:34:06,809 --> 00:34:08,610
Trooper pin, yep.

398
00:34:08,610 --> 00:34:10,090
Amulet's still good.

399
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:13,730
Ghost metal, I think maybe, no, keep the amulet on.

400
00:34:13,730 --> 00:34:15,489
Keep Malo, keep Malo, keep Malo.

401
00:34:16,369 --> 00:34:19,010
Guys, Malo doesn't have any stuff.

402
00:34:19,889 --> 00:34:21,090
I didn't buy his shit.

403
00:34:23,170 --> 00:34:25,170
Look, he's got mega pants on.

404
00:34:25,170 --> 00:34:27,960
Like, he has shitty pants on.

405
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:33,969
Keep Malo or riot.

406
00:34:33,969 --> 00:34:36,690
Maybe if I get to go back to town, I'll switch him out.

407
00:34:36,690 --> 00:34:42,739
Does that make you happy?

408
00:34:42,739 --> 00:34:44,659
Only the person holding it gets double EXP.

409
00:34:44,659 --> 00:34:45,739
They don't have to be in the party.

410
00:34:45,739 --> 00:34:47,019
That's, yeah, that's what I was thinking.

411
00:34:47,019 --> 00:34:50,119
So, Malo currently is getting double experience.

412
00:34:50,119 --> 00:34:53,599
I'm absolutely exhausted.

413
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:57,679
Quick, quick, quick, quick.

414
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:00,670
I hate being a guard.

415
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:05,559
Valentino only gives us the most boring jobs to do.

416
00:35:05,559 --> 00:35:07,679
But I guess this beats Dodo's job.

417
00:35:09,409 --> 00:35:15,030
Dodo has to polish Valentino's statues every single day.

418
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:16,429
This is how I would do it.

419
00:35:23,199 --> 00:35:27,769
Oh, hey, tell me something.

420
00:35:27,769 --> 00:35:30,869
Do statues move?

421
00:35:30,869 --> 00:35:33,400
No, statues don't move.

422
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:37,599
Then explain this.

423
00:35:37,639 --> 00:35:42,400
It's one of those high-tech, lifelike, realistic ones.

424
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:53,190
Let's get out of here.

425
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:55,090
Hey, here we are.

426
00:35:55,090 --> 00:36:01,019
Actually, let me go.

427
00:36:01,019 --> 00:36:02,860
Yeah, we can go pretty much anywhere.

428
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:05,659
Got that flower tab, sick.

429
00:36:05,659 --> 00:36:06,500
Let's get a fight.

430
00:36:13,469 --> 00:36:23,510
Boom.

431
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:26,030
Big Yoshi, big Yoshi, big Yoshi, what are you talking about?

432
00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:27,269
This is an absolute unit.

433
00:36:32,349 --> 00:36:38,559
Absolute unit Koopa.

434
00:36:38,559 --> 00:36:48,400
All right, level 16 Toast Duel.

435
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:51,079
It's time, we pick, we pick, we pick, we pick, we pick.

436
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:52,400
Hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

437
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,440
I gotta, I didn't even put,

438
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:56,849
the extension's not even turned on.

439
00:36:56,849 --> 00:37:05,119
All right, you guys can, you guys can now click on it.

440
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:08,980
Absolute unit.

441
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:12,949
Imagine being that much of a fucking unit.

442
00:37:17,989 --> 00:37:20,269
By the way, if you don't know how this works,

443
00:37:20,269 --> 00:37:24,409
you enable the extension and click on your screen.

444
00:37:24,409 --> 00:37:26,570
By the way, for the entire month of September,

445
00:37:26,570 --> 00:37:32,179
that's right, if you go outside,

446
00:37:32,179 --> 00:37:35,539
it's gonna be a little cooler than it was last month.

447
00:37:35,539 --> 00:37:37,840
Ball is starting.

448
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:41,329
Buy a jacket.

449
00:37:41,329 --> 00:37:52,349
Thank you for voting.

450
00:37:52,349 --> 00:37:57,510
Magic attack 72.

451
00:37:57,510 --> 00:37:58,349
All right, what is this, what is this,

452
00:37:58,349 --> 00:38:04,050
what is this, what is this over here?

453
00:38:04,050 --> 00:38:08,440
Oh, that's right, he's a fan.

454
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,440
Let's go this way.

455
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:12,010
I got the tab, that's what I wanted.

456
00:38:12,010 --> 00:38:17,079
Actually, you know what, I'm gonna go up

457
00:38:17,079 --> 00:38:20,130
because the fan blows and I'm gonna wait

458
00:38:20,130 --> 00:38:21,329
for the fan to turn on.

459
00:38:21,329 --> 00:38:24,090
I think I can actually wrap around this fan.

460
00:38:24,090 --> 00:38:25,889
Oh, get out of here, leave me alone.

461
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:47,019
Come on, Malo, level up.

462
00:38:47,019 --> 00:38:49,019
I wanna get rid of that.

463
00:38:49,019 --> 00:38:51,139
Geno blast, it just wipes out everybody.

464
00:38:58,190 --> 00:39:07,219
333333, Malo, nope, it's Bowser.

465
00:39:07,219 --> 00:39:10,179
Level 16, 136, 144, no one's at 200 HP yet,

466
00:39:10,179 --> 00:39:11,579
which concerns me.

467
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:29,860
By the way, if you click on Bowser,

468
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:31,219
that counts as a middle vote.

469
00:39:31,219 --> 00:39:34,340
So yes, we've made that clear already.

470
00:39:47,150 --> 00:39:57,170
Okay, 127 attack power, that's so much.

471
00:39:57,170 --> 00:39:58,210
That's too much.

472
00:40:05,619 --> 00:40:16,789
Got it, nope, okay, I couldn't block that for some reason.

473
00:40:23,519 --> 00:40:24,840
Okay, that was weird.

474
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:33,420
Miss, I don't like that.

475
00:40:39,239 --> 00:40:41,400
I don't really think I'm gonna kill it

476
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:44,849
with the next punch, so I'm gonna defend.

477
00:40:47,929 --> 00:40:58,659
Everyone's okay, I'm gonna try jump.

478
00:40:58,659 --> 00:41:00,179
Thank God, Jesus, that was the hardest

479
00:41:00,179 --> 00:41:03,739
fucking enemy in the game.

480
00:41:03,739 --> 00:41:05,300
I think that actually probably was the hardest thing

481
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:07,300
I've ever faced in Super Mario.

482
00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:18,440
Look at that dodge.

483
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:19,679
I was thinking about just getting hit

484
00:41:19,679 --> 00:41:21,119
over and over again and dying,

485
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:23,760
but then I saved like two long ago.

486
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:36,280
I didn't wanna do that whole thing again.

487
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:38,880
No, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh.

488
00:41:50,369 --> 00:41:54,190
Heavy trooper's ready to launch.

489
00:41:54,190 --> 00:41:55,869
If you let the heavy trooper launch,

490
00:41:55,869 --> 00:42:01,630
I believe everybody dies.

491
00:42:01,630 --> 00:42:06,519
That's 62, that's 64 EXP from Malo.

492
00:42:06,519 --> 00:42:27,630
Malo's gonna over-level everybody, magic.

493
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:29,719
I should just give it to Bowser.

494
00:42:29,719 --> 00:42:35,789
Yeah, okay, after this, I'm gonna switch it over to Bowser.

495
00:42:35,789 --> 00:42:39,820
Because Bowser's gonna be unstoppable.

496
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:47,010
You guys got all the flowers, nice job.

497
00:42:47,010 --> 00:42:52,219
84, all right, let's give it to Bowser.

498
00:42:52,219 --> 00:43:00,929
We're gonna spread this thing around.

499
00:43:00,929 --> 00:43:02,130
Hey, wait a minute, it's locked.

500
00:43:02,130 --> 00:43:05,119
Ooh, do you like that dodge?

501
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:12,320
Whoa, he's like right up me.

502
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:14,880
Jawful sleeping, not for long.

503
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:20,840
I love this character, by the way.

504
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:25,530
He's just a fork.

505
00:43:25,530 --> 00:43:32,480
No, oh God.

506
00:43:34,559 --> 00:43:35,800
Jawful sleeping, again.

507
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:37,800
We just geno-blast everybody

508
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:39,559
from here till the end of the game.

509
00:43:41,199 --> 00:43:46,650
That's how this works.

510
00:43:46,650 --> 00:43:50,510
Don't run, don't run.

511
00:43:50,510 --> 00:43:56,510
Good, because these guys drop good stuff.

512
00:43:56,510 --> 00:44:03,969
44 coins, grab this, here it is, another tab.

513
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:16,289
Birdcage is right in the way, it's okay.

514
00:44:16,289 --> 00:44:17,289
You know what I'm gonna do.

515
00:44:17,289 --> 00:44:20,210
Oh no, I ran out of power points.

516
00:44:20,210 --> 00:44:21,050
That's all right.

517
00:44:26,010 --> 00:44:26,849
Lucky.

518
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:43,159
Jawful's awake.

519
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:49,159
I'll be honest, that's the face that I make too

520
00:44:49,159 --> 00:44:50,480
when I just wake up.

521
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:53,880
If somebody just wakes me up abruptly,

522
00:44:53,880 --> 00:45:01,050
you kinda sit there like, wait, is this for real?

523
00:45:01,050 --> 00:45:15,059
Ow, why are you taking so much damage now?

524
00:45:16,099 --> 00:45:20,340
Oh dude, that face went laughing my ass off.

525
00:45:20,340 --> 00:45:21,179
Is this experience?

526
00:45:21,179 --> 00:45:23,099
It is, all right, this is important, follow it.

527
00:45:23,099 --> 00:45:25,500
Pay attention, click over to the new tab.

528
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:27,500
It's the right one, I think.

529
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:36,949
Don't take my word for it though.

530
00:45:36,949 --> 00:45:38,559
Am I wrong?

531
00:45:38,559 --> 00:45:51,360
Don't listen to me, use your own judgment.

532
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:52,559
All right, I'm gonna go with you.

533
00:45:52,559 --> 00:45:56,579
All right, I hope you're right.

534
00:45:56,579 --> 00:45:59,989
How are you guys right every fucking time?

535
00:45:59,989 --> 00:46:10,880
I don't understand.

536
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:14,739
How can you get that every single time?

537
00:46:14,739 --> 00:46:21,460
You have not been wrong once.

538
00:46:21,460 --> 00:46:23,219
We're gamers, unlike you.

539
00:46:23,219 --> 00:46:24,300
Well, maybe some of you are,

540
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:28,869
because 15% of you clicked on Peach's face.

541
00:46:28,869 --> 00:46:38,820
So come on, give me a break.

542
00:46:38,820 --> 00:46:40,300
You have to go to the bathroom, can I stop for a second?

543
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:42,320
Yeah, go on.

544
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:56,230
You have 30 seconds to compete, whatever.

545
00:46:56,230 --> 00:47:09,719
Go on.

546
00:47:09,719 --> 00:47:11,679
I should just change games before they get back

547
00:47:11,679 --> 00:47:19,639
and just act like nothing happened.

548
00:47:19,639 --> 00:47:20,480
What are you talking about, man?

549
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:23,190
Like with Super Mario RPG, no.

550
00:47:23,190 --> 00:47:24,710
We're playing Dead Cells.

551
00:47:24,710 --> 00:47:26,670
What are you, are you all right?

552
00:47:26,670 --> 00:47:34,440
What are you talking about?

553
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:36,280
Go like download a save file from somewhere,

554
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:38,119
like there's like 7,000 hours in the game

555
00:47:38,119 --> 00:47:48,079
and it's like I have every ability and shit.

556
00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:50,400
Switch to XCOM and name everybody Mario,

557
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:51,840
Malo, Peach, and Bowser.

558
00:47:54,590 --> 00:47:56,570
Ooh, we've got,

559
00:47:56,610 --> 00:47:58,369
we've got a new,

560
00:47:58,369 --> 00:48:01,900
you're clicking on the top right button.

561
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:05,920
That's new.

562
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:07,920
Usually you just click on the right flower,

563
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:10,519
but I mean today it's different.

564
00:48:10,519 --> 00:48:14,119
You're clicking on the top right button thing.

565
00:48:14,119 --> 00:48:16,119
Look at how low this percentage is to click this.

566
00:48:16,119 --> 00:48:22,150
Look at how low that is.

567
00:48:22,150 --> 00:48:25,280
Does democracy work?

568
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:33,699
Because like only 14%.

569
00:48:33,699 --> 00:48:35,380
How many people went into the voting booth

570
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:36,780
and like sneezed on the paper

571
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:40,000
and like moved their pencil and just left?

572
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,400
How many people went into the voting booth

573
00:48:41,719 --> 00:48:43,800
in the last election and just like

574
00:48:45,659 --> 00:48:54,320
put like a marker on like the letter T?

575
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:56,719
This is, this is, this is the, okay.

576
00:48:56,719 --> 00:49:05,960
10, 12, 12, 8%, 8%.

577
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:11,519
They just take the pencil and leave.

578
00:49:11,519 --> 00:49:13,400
But what did you do in the voting booth?

579
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:17,829
Well, I drew a smiley face

580
00:49:17,829 --> 00:49:20,750
and there was some calligraphy on the voting ballot

581
00:49:20,750 --> 00:49:23,400
and I circled it.

582
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:25,159
Did you vote for anything

583
00:49:25,159 --> 00:49:26,840
that was supposed to be voted for?

584
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:28,510
What?

585
00:49:28,510 --> 00:49:31,469
No, a left calligraphy gang.

586
00:49:31,469 --> 00:49:33,030
And then they walk away.

587
00:49:33,030 --> 00:49:51,119
Okay, I guess we're going with power.

588
00:49:51,119 --> 00:50:01,659
No, I gotta pay, go, go, go, go, go, go.

589
00:50:01,659 --> 00:50:03,539
No, I forgot to take my potion.

590
00:50:03,539 --> 00:50:04,900
Now I have to fight them for real.

591
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:07,179
I can't use my cop out magic move.

592
00:50:20,909 --> 00:50:38,769
Ow, I just, I don't know why I just thought of this.

593
00:50:38,769 --> 00:50:40,090
Like ballots, right?

594
00:50:40,090 --> 00:50:42,090
You go and like, you go whatever the ballot,

595
00:50:42,090 --> 00:50:44,530
whatever you're voting for.

596
00:50:44,530 --> 00:50:46,130
And you kind of, it's like,

597
00:50:46,170 --> 00:50:50,250
but like one, two, three, four, five, right?

598
00:50:50,250 --> 00:50:51,809
I just imagined like some old person

599
00:50:51,809 --> 00:50:55,849
just like speaking like a confessional through the wall.

600
00:50:55,849 --> 00:50:58,730
Hey, who are you voting for?

601
00:50:58,730 --> 00:51:00,010
I don't know what to do.

602
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:17,659
Can I see your paper?

603
00:51:17,659 --> 00:51:29,949
I didn't study, I didn't study for this test.

604
00:51:29,949 --> 00:51:31,429
Holy shit, there's a lot of coins.

605
00:51:31,429 --> 00:51:33,110
Ooh, and watch.

606
00:51:33,110 --> 00:51:36,530
Click, click, over here, over here, over here.

607
00:51:36,530 --> 00:51:37,889
I know which one of these is the middle thing.

608
00:51:37,889 --> 00:51:38,889
Don't listen to me.

609
00:51:57,969 --> 00:52:01,199
Yeah.

610
00:52:01,199 --> 00:52:07,960
Yoshi and Yoshi are both selected.

611
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:09,719
Yoshi and Yoshi.

612
00:52:09,719 --> 00:52:13,340
You guys are wrong.

613
00:52:13,340 --> 00:52:20,429
We lost all that experience.

614
00:52:20,429 --> 00:52:27,800
Shouldn't have listened to me.

615
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:30,280
What's double, can you get double of zero?

616
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:32,679
No, that's math, Jeremy, that's math.

617
00:52:32,679 --> 00:52:38,110
It doesn't work that way.

618
00:52:38,110 --> 00:52:38,949
No, I'm just gonna do it now

619
00:52:38,949 --> 00:52:46,179
because I just keep, I keep forgetting to do it.

620
00:52:46,179 --> 00:52:49,039
You should have just clicked on Yoshi.

621
00:52:49,039 --> 00:53:07,480
I should have, it's fine.

622
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:09,719
I know you guys saying, oh, big chunky guy,

623
00:53:09,719 --> 00:53:14,989
big, big, chunky, chewy guy, whatever, right?

624
00:53:14,989 --> 00:53:17,670
No, that's a hamster that has a shell on it

625
00:53:17,670 --> 00:53:19,070
as like a funny little joke.

626
00:53:21,559 --> 00:53:23,039
That's just a hamster, guys.

627
00:53:23,039 --> 00:53:34,449
That's not a Koopa Troopa.

628
00:53:34,449 --> 00:53:38,880
Oh, fuck, is everybody dead?

629
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:41,719
He didn't do it, okay.

630
00:53:41,719 --> 00:53:55,969
God, I can't even say what you said.

631
00:53:55,969 --> 00:53:57,369
What is wrong with you guys?

632
00:54:00,289 --> 00:54:01,449
I'm laughing, I'm laughing.

633
00:54:01,449 --> 00:54:02,650
I think it's funny, whatever.

634
00:54:02,650 --> 00:54:19,349
I don't have any mushrooms.

635
00:54:19,349 --> 00:54:20,710
No, that's not what I read.

636
00:54:22,550 --> 00:54:27,099
Come on, here we go.

637
00:54:27,099 --> 00:54:34,889
Back to cheating.

638
00:54:34,889 --> 00:54:36,610
That's not what I laughed at.

639
00:54:36,610 --> 00:54:50,750
No, it's not.

640
00:54:50,750 --> 00:54:52,989
A lot of experience though here.

641
00:54:52,989 --> 00:54:54,550
This is pretty cool.

642
00:54:54,550 --> 00:54:56,190
Oh, I found everybody.

643
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:06,559
I used to be a guard here

644
00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:09,039
until Valentina snapped away all my keys

645
00:55:09,039 --> 00:55:10,760
and gave me the boot.

646
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:13,239
Guess I won't be needing this master key anymore.

647
00:55:13,239 --> 00:55:14,800
Would you like it?

648
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:16,050
Please.

649
00:55:16,050 --> 00:55:17,210
All right, here you go.

650
00:55:17,210 --> 00:55:23,730
Just don't tell me what you're gonna do with it, okay?

651
00:55:23,730 --> 00:55:26,530
Do you know that there are hot springs around here?

652
00:55:26,530 --> 00:55:27,610
Mm-hmm.

653
00:55:27,610 --> 00:55:28,570
Oh, you're no fun.

654
00:55:28,570 --> 00:55:31,909
I wanted to be the first to tell you.

655
00:55:31,909 --> 00:55:34,000
Go on, take this.

656
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,619
Flower jar.

657
00:55:36,619 --> 00:55:37,460
A dip in the hot springs

658
00:55:37,460 --> 00:55:41,460
would perk up the king in the jiffy.

659
00:55:41,460 --> 00:55:42,619
Hey, did you know?

660
00:55:42,619 --> 00:55:46,099
Valentina's got a huge egg in the middle room.

661
00:55:46,099 --> 00:55:47,980
It spits out eggs from time to time

662
00:55:47,980 --> 00:55:50,019
and sometimes when you shield yourself,

663
00:55:50,019 --> 00:55:53,739
the eggs will ricochet off of you.

664
00:55:53,739 --> 00:56:11,219
Why do you, how do you know this?

665
00:56:11,539 --> 00:56:22,639
I thought he was an NPC.

666
00:56:22,639 --> 00:56:25,739
Those who don't want Geno in Smash,

667
00:56:25,739 --> 00:56:26,860
after just seeing that.

668
00:56:27,820 --> 00:56:38,880
Okay.

669
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:40,880
Sans got in before Geno.

670
00:56:46,030 --> 00:56:48,030
I'm just imagining the posts.

671
00:56:48,030 --> 00:56:50,949
Sans from Undertale gets in before Geno,

672
00:56:50,949 --> 00:56:53,590
like a laughing fucking laughing guy.

673
00:57:12,090 --> 00:57:15,170
Geno isn't in Smash, but Sans gets in?

674
00:57:15,170 --> 00:57:19,079
Compilation of celebrities laughing hysterically

675
00:57:19,119 --> 00:57:42,480
in an image.

676
00:57:49,239 --> 00:57:50,079
Hey, you're mad.

677
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:52,960
It's you and one of them that's mad about Sans.

678
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:54,960
Holy shit, Bowser's leveled up again.

679
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:58,119
Whoa.

680
00:57:58,119 --> 00:57:59,880
Why would I be mad about a character

681
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:02,690
getting put into Smash Bros.?

682
00:58:02,690 --> 00:58:04,760
Really?

683
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:07,159
Why would I be angry that somebody gets to be happy

684
00:58:07,159 --> 00:58:08,960
that somebody that they like to play as

685
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:13,079
or have cared about gets to be in one of their favorite games?

686
00:58:13,079 --> 00:58:16,489
Why would that make me angry?

687
00:58:16,489 --> 00:58:20,650
No, I think that's great.

688
00:58:20,650 --> 00:58:32,389
All right, where we going?

689
00:58:32,389 --> 00:58:33,230
He's mad.

690
00:58:33,230 --> 00:58:34,630
He's just...

691
00:58:34,630 --> 00:58:35,880
Ooh, nice.

692
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:39,369
This is a tough one.

693
00:58:39,369 --> 00:58:46,139
I thank you Wingus Dingus 69 for the 10 community subs.

694
00:58:46,139 --> 00:58:54,360
Thank you for the 10 subs, Wingus Dingus.

695
00:58:54,360 --> 00:58:55,559
Come on, pick one.

696
00:58:55,559 --> 00:58:59,489
Pick one.

697
00:58:59,489 --> 00:59:12,079
You're going back and forth here.

698
00:59:12,079 --> 00:59:13,789
Okay.

699
00:59:13,789 --> 00:59:18,480
You've decided.

700
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:19,659
Thank you for voting.

701
00:59:19,659 --> 00:59:20,900
We're going HP.

702
00:59:20,900 --> 00:59:23,900
Ooh, HP was not the right choice.

703
00:59:23,900 --> 00:59:25,460
HP, wrong choice.

704
00:59:25,460 --> 00:59:26,300
One.

705
00:59:26,300 --> 00:59:33,659
That's not good.

706
00:59:33,659 --> 00:59:34,500
Stop it.

707
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:35,340
Leave me alone.

708
00:59:35,539 --> 00:59:44,010
Treasure.

709
00:59:44,010 --> 00:59:46,159
There's the key.

710
00:59:46,159 --> 00:59:47,000
Leave you.

711
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:50,760
Uh-oh.

712
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:53,320
Look what I get to do again.

713
00:59:53,320 --> 00:59:56,719
I get to make 150 to 200 people leave the stream.

714
01:00:01,460 --> 01:00:03,300
La dee da.

715
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:05,820
Here you go, big eggy.

716
01:00:05,820 --> 01:00:07,179
I'll give you plenty of nutrients

717
01:00:07,179 --> 01:00:11,780
so you'll grow up to be big and strong.

718
01:00:11,780 --> 01:00:15,460
Oh, Mario's already here.

719
01:00:15,460 --> 01:00:21,159
He's a fast one, he is.

720
01:00:21,159 --> 01:00:22,639
It won't help him.

721
01:00:22,639 --> 01:00:28,309
It's not.

722
01:00:29,230 --> 01:00:41,219
Let me try.

723
01:00:41,219 --> 01:00:43,099
I'm so lonely.

724
01:00:43,099 --> 01:00:48,400
Would you play with me?

725
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:57,119
Thanks.

726
01:00:57,119 --> 01:00:58,079
Crack the egg.

727
01:01:15,679 --> 01:01:20,070
Hello, I'm Birdo.

728
01:01:20,070 --> 01:01:21,869
Birdo, you're going to be...

729
01:01:21,869 --> 01:01:22,710
What is my name?

730
01:01:22,710 --> 01:01:23,550
30?

731
01:01:23,550 --> 01:01:34,900
I need 30 jumps, right?

732
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:38,119
That was like eight.

733
01:01:38,119 --> 01:01:38,960
Well, that hurt.

734
01:01:53,110 --> 01:01:54,909
Thank you.

735
01:01:54,909 --> 01:01:56,429
Again, ultra jump.

736
01:01:56,429 --> 01:01:57,269
Here we go.

737
01:02:12,500 --> 01:02:13,340
Shit.

738
01:02:14,639 --> 01:02:15,760
Teehee.

739
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:17,480
Ouch, you're hurting me.

740
01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:19,280
Now it's my turn.

741
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:23,880
Get it while it's hot.

742
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:24,719
Oh.

743
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:27,960
Too many subs.

744
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:28,800
Too many subs.

745
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:29,920
That's 69 subs.

746
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:32,079
None of those are half off.

747
01:02:32,079 --> 01:02:34,360
I hope you're aware of that.

748
01:02:34,360 --> 01:02:36,880
That's 69 subs from phylactery lich.

749
01:02:40,239 --> 01:02:42,239
69 subs.

750
01:02:42,239 --> 01:02:46,199
Too many subs.

751
01:02:46,199 --> 01:02:47,239
Thank you, phylactery.

752
01:02:47,239 --> 01:02:49,719
That's an absolute shitload.

753
01:02:49,719 --> 01:02:51,079
Again.

754
01:02:51,239 --> 01:02:52,079
Again.

755
01:02:57,630 --> 01:02:59,630
Doing it again.

756
01:02:59,630 --> 01:03:01,190
So this one's for you.

757
01:03:01,190 --> 01:03:04,909
Here we go.

758
01:03:04,909 --> 01:03:17,860
Four, seven, 12, 16, 17, 18, and 13 damage.

759
01:03:28,610 --> 01:03:32,039
I'll get it.

760
01:03:32,039 --> 01:03:33,760
But, oh, seriously, phylactery.

761
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:35,119
That's...

762
01:03:35,119 --> 01:03:38,960
You're encroaching on like 500 fucking subs on the channel.

763
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:40,360
Something insane like that.

764
01:03:41,699 --> 01:04:00,210
I have to get this, come on.

765
01:04:00,250 --> 01:04:05,639
Damn it, I keep getting stopped at like 19, 20.

766
01:04:05,639 --> 01:04:11,619
You have to beat Kyro Toby.

767
01:04:11,619 --> 01:04:22,730
Well, it's never a competition.

768
01:04:22,730 --> 01:04:38,650
Again.

769
01:04:38,650 --> 01:04:45,170
Fuck.

770
01:04:45,170 --> 01:04:49,940
All right, I've had enough.

771
01:04:49,940 --> 01:04:52,659
Nevermind.

772
01:04:52,659 --> 01:04:53,500
15.

773
01:04:53,500 --> 01:04:54,980
15, I know.

774
01:04:54,980 --> 01:04:59,710
I gotta get 30.

775
01:04:59,710 --> 01:05:07,780
Come on, I'm out of points.

776
01:05:07,780 --> 01:05:09,269
Ow.

777
01:05:09,269 --> 01:05:10,670
All right.

778
01:05:10,670 --> 01:05:19,699
All right, ghetto.

779
01:05:19,699 --> 01:05:24,400
Peach really is incredible.

780
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:27,320
I used to fill my inventory with junk.

781
01:05:27,320 --> 01:05:41,239
Okay, here we go.

782
01:05:42,429 --> 01:05:44,070
So those of you that don't know,

783
01:05:44,070 --> 01:05:49,070
the timing of the jump changes after 12 to 15 jumps.

784
01:05:50,190 --> 01:05:51,989
What ends up happening is it shrinks

785
01:05:51,989 --> 01:05:56,030
to about like two pixels after 15 or so.

786
01:05:56,909 --> 01:06:00,389
So trying to find the timing is very hard.

787
01:06:00,389 --> 01:06:02,380
I'm gonna do it.

788
01:06:02,380 --> 01:06:04,380
Oh, I'm never gonna let you go.

789
01:06:04,380 --> 01:06:18,440
You're just too cute.

790
01:06:18,440 --> 01:06:21,250
Castle key two.

791
01:06:21,250 --> 01:06:23,369
Never gonna give you up.

792
01:06:23,369 --> 01:06:27,309
I'm never gonna give you up.

793
01:06:27,670 --> 01:06:28,630
Just hold the stick.

794
01:06:28,630 --> 01:06:33,530
Hold the stick in your hand, jump, swing.

795
01:06:33,530 --> 01:06:34,769
It's all you need to do, Mario.

796
01:06:34,769 --> 01:06:47,449
Come on.

797
01:06:47,449 --> 01:06:49,130
No.

798
01:06:49,130 --> 01:06:50,369
I forgot.

799
01:06:51,369 --> 01:06:52,210
Oh no.

800
01:06:52,210 --> 01:06:55,570
Gee, I used a pinwheel.

801
01:06:55,570 --> 01:07:14,590
Oh no, I used a pinwheel.

802
01:07:14,590 --> 01:07:29,679
Come on.

803
01:07:35,030 --> 01:07:40,960
Right at that 15, 16, it goes down to like one pixel.

804
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:50,409
God, didn't get 30 on pinwheel.

805
01:07:50,889 --> 01:08:04,199
I'm an idiot.

806
01:08:04,199 --> 01:08:07,639
Ooh, that was a lot of coins.

807
01:08:07,639 --> 01:08:14,070
Uh-oh, we've got an issue here.

808
01:08:14,070 --> 01:08:16,869
This is locked too.

809
01:08:16,869 --> 01:08:19,520
Mario, look, there's a note.

810
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:24,710
Let's read it.

811
01:08:24,710 --> 01:08:27,310
King Nimbus is resting in bed.

812
01:08:27,310 --> 01:08:29,949
Absolutely no running in the heart.

813
01:08:29,949 --> 01:08:32,260
From Queen Valentine.

814
01:08:32,260 --> 01:08:35,279
This can only mean that mom and dad are in here.

815
01:08:35,279 --> 01:08:36,279
Oh, but it's locked.

816
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:38,920
Leave it to me.

817
01:08:40,890 --> 01:08:44,569
Looks like it's up to me to get us out of yet another jam.

818
01:08:45,329 --> 01:08:51,000
Feast your eyes on this show of brains and brawn.

819
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:56,979
Stand back.

820
01:08:56,979 --> 01:08:59,319
Wait, wait a minute.

821
01:08:59,319 --> 01:09:00,720
If my dad's really bedridden,

822
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:04,199
we shouldn't make so much noise.

823
01:09:04,199 --> 01:09:07,600
We need another plan.

824
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:09,000
I guess we should find Valentina

825
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:12,369
and force the truth out of her.

826
01:09:12,369 --> 01:09:16,199
Uh, Bowser, I don't want to tell you this,

827
01:09:16,199 --> 01:09:19,800
but you know, I'm pointing at my nose.

828
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:20,640
I'm like looking at you.

829
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:22,319
I'm looking at you, direct eye contact.

830
01:09:22,319 --> 01:09:24,159
Hey, like touching under my nose,

831
01:09:24,159 --> 01:09:26,760
like wipe, like wipe under your fucking nose, dude.

832
01:09:26,760 --> 01:09:30,789
Like we're like at a party.

833
01:09:30,789 --> 01:09:39,850
But what about the door?

834
01:09:39,850 --> 01:09:42,770
Listen, you never ever talk to the leader

835
01:09:42,770 --> 01:09:44,649
of the Koopa troop like that.

836
01:09:44,649 --> 01:09:48,720
Oh, I hate that.

837
01:09:48,720 --> 01:09:50,439
Ah, I'll ignore it this time,

838
01:09:50,439 --> 01:09:55,270
but don't let that happen again.

839
01:09:55,270 --> 01:09:59,399
Queen Valentina.

840
01:09:59,399 --> 01:10:20,739
Ooh, ooh, Queen Valentina.

841
01:10:20,739 --> 01:10:22,979
It's like someone's reading a book to kids.

842
01:10:22,979 --> 01:10:28,750
No, but the only difference is I would be like

843
01:10:28,750 --> 01:10:36,670
falling asleep halfway through.

844
01:10:36,670 --> 01:10:38,909
That's what my mother used to do.

845
01:10:38,909 --> 01:10:40,510
She would start to pass out,

846
01:10:40,510 --> 01:10:48,760
like fall asleep while reading stories.

847
01:10:48,760 --> 01:10:50,680
Oh, heavy troop is coming in.

848
01:11:02,609 --> 01:11:05,039
Here we go.

849
01:11:05,039 --> 01:11:06,960
Queen Valentina.

850
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:08,600
This is what my mother would do.

851
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:10,039
So she'd like do voices and stuff.

852
01:11:10,039 --> 01:11:12,760
That Mario creature who beat up Smilax is here.

853
01:11:14,090 --> 01:11:16,439
Mario?

854
01:11:16,439 --> 01:11:19,199
What does a Mario look like?

855
01:11:19,199 --> 01:11:20,800
Well, it has a bushy mustache,

856
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:25,489
long sideburns and a pair of mean looking legs.

857
01:11:25,489 --> 01:11:31,930
I have a feeling I've seen this Mario before.

858
01:11:31,930 --> 01:11:35,529
And I'd be like, Mom?

859
01:11:35,529 --> 01:11:39,819
Wait, yes, that was a setch that Gora just delivered.

860
01:11:39,819 --> 01:11:40,739
What are you going to do?

861
01:11:40,739 --> 01:11:43,409
What are you going to do, Valentina?

862
01:11:43,409 --> 01:11:44,649
Well, we certainly aren't going to listen

863
01:11:44,649 --> 01:11:49,060
to your pointless chatter.

864
01:11:49,060 --> 01:11:50,460
Mom, what happens next?

865
01:11:50,460 --> 01:11:52,819
Frankly speaking, I'm not going to worry

866
01:11:52,819 --> 01:11:53,899
without this key.

867
01:11:53,899 --> 01:11:57,579
The king can't go anywhere.

868
01:11:57,579 --> 01:11:58,699
This is real.

869
01:11:58,699 --> 01:12:05,670
This happened.

870
01:12:06,510 --> 01:12:07,350
I'm not telling a joke.

871
01:12:07,350 --> 01:12:08,189
This is reality.

872
01:12:08,189 --> 01:12:10,880
This is what happened.

873
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:12,880
My mother worked hard, okay?

874
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:14,439
Give me a break.

875
01:12:14,439 --> 01:12:19,039
Hush.

876
01:12:19,039 --> 01:12:23,600
I said, shut up already.

877
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:24,439
What?

878
01:12:24,439 --> 01:12:25,880
That isn't a statue.

879
01:12:25,880 --> 01:12:28,840
That's Mario.

880
01:12:28,840 --> 01:12:31,359
Valentina, hand over to me now.

881
01:12:36,550 --> 01:12:38,319
My leg.

882
01:12:38,319 --> 01:12:39,479
How utterly rude.

883
01:12:39,479 --> 01:12:43,050
And who in the blazes are you anyways?

884
01:12:43,050 --> 01:12:45,050
Me, I'm the real Prince, that's who.

885
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:47,760
Brat.

886
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:52,350
How dare you listen in on a private conversation.

887
01:12:52,350 --> 01:12:53,729
Private?

888
01:12:53,729 --> 01:12:57,920
Private, everybody in a 10-mile radius could hear you.

889
01:12:57,920 --> 01:13:00,359
Oh, if you're going to be this rude,

890
01:13:00,359 --> 01:13:02,119
I'm simply going to leave.

891
01:13:02,119 --> 01:13:04,359
So long, chumps.

892
01:13:07,500 --> 01:13:11,039
Hey, Valentina ran away.

893
01:13:11,039 --> 01:13:12,520
I shall fly the coop too.

894
01:13:20,560 --> 01:13:23,710
I think we've kind of missed a boat here.

895
01:13:23,710 --> 01:13:25,470
So we better get moving too.

896
01:13:25,470 --> 01:13:48,460
Let's go, get him.

897
01:13:48,460 --> 01:14:02,239
I didn't mean to do that.

898
01:14:02,239 --> 01:14:03,840
Dodo is cute.

899
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:04,680
Dodo is cute.

900
01:14:15,800 --> 01:14:17,039
Here comes the launch.

901
01:14:25,560 --> 01:14:26,399
Somebody leveled up?

902
01:14:26,399 --> 01:14:33,119
No.

903
01:14:33,119 --> 01:14:38,840
See that nice dodge?

904
01:14:38,840 --> 01:14:45,409
Oh, fuck, I forgot this was here.

905
01:14:45,409 --> 01:14:46,489
I just killed Dodo.

906
01:14:46,489 --> 01:14:47,649
Oh, shit.

907
01:14:47,649 --> 01:14:48,810
Dodo.

908
01:14:48,810 --> 01:14:49,810
No.

909
01:14:49,810 --> 01:14:53,560
Oh, poor Dodo.

910
01:14:53,560 --> 01:15:05,039
I just starred him.

911
01:15:05,039 --> 01:15:05,880
Hot springs are up ahead,

912
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:07,680
but only really to go there.

913
01:15:07,680 --> 01:15:15,729
You don't look like royalty.

914
01:15:15,729 --> 01:15:16,569
All right.

915
01:15:16,569 --> 01:15:18,199
I, what have I got?

916
01:15:18,199 --> 01:15:20,329
Why do I have to like items?

917
01:15:20,329 --> 01:15:22,170
Max mushroom, max mushroom, honey syrup.

918
01:15:22,170 --> 01:15:25,520
I have way too many honey syrups.

919
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:28,140
I'm going to do the flower jar though, I'm taking it.

920
01:15:28,140 --> 01:15:30,180
Froggy drink, Carol, Carol, Cola.

921
01:15:34,239 --> 01:15:35,159
Okay.

922
01:15:35,159 --> 01:15:42,520
Shall we?

923
01:15:42,520 --> 01:15:43,520
Queen Valentina.

924
01:15:46,989 --> 01:15:48,310
Queen Valentina, is the king showing

925
01:15:48,310 --> 01:15:50,619
any sign of improvement?

926
01:15:50,619 --> 01:15:53,159
And how is his wife, the old queen?

927
01:15:53,159 --> 01:15:55,079
And Tubby, I mean, Prince Malo,

928
01:15:55,079 --> 01:15:57,539
where is he hiding these days?

929
01:15:57,539 --> 01:15:58,380
You know what I think?

930
01:15:58,380 --> 01:16:00,060
I think, get out of here.

931
01:16:00,060 --> 01:16:03,000
The truth, get out, let me check.

932
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,039
You know what I think?

933
01:16:05,039 --> 01:16:07,720
Ugh!

934
01:16:07,720 --> 01:16:09,970
Pipe down, all of you.

935
01:16:09,970 --> 01:16:11,010
I have better things to do

936
01:16:11,010 --> 01:16:13,729
than listen to your half-wit opinions.

937
01:16:13,729 --> 01:16:16,090
And look, while I've been wasting my time

938
01:16:16,090 --> 01:16:18,090
listening to your endless chatter,

939
01:16:18,090 --> 01:16:22,520
Mario has managed to find me.

940
01:16:22,520 --> 01:16:23,640
Dodo?

941
01:16:23,640 --> 01:16:26,140
Dodo?

942
01:16:26,140 --> 01:16:29,140
Oh, that bird has a permanent brain cramp.

943
01:16:29,140 --> 01:16:29,979
Dodo, do you hear me?

944
01:16:29,979 --> 01:16:30,819
Get over here now.

945
01:16:30,819 --> 01:16:33,800
I need some help entertaining Mario.

946
01:16:33,800 --> 01:16:35,119
So move it.

947
01:16:35,119 --> 01:16:40,199
Come over here now.

948
01:16:40,199 --> 01:16:41,319
He psych killed him.

949
01:16:42,319 --> 01:16:43,600
Dodo?

950
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:45,800
Dodo?

951
01:16:45,800 --> 01:16:48,579
Where are you?

952
01:16:48,579 --> 01:16:50,060
Don't just sit there, help me.

953
01:16:57,319 --> 01:17:02,329
Uh-oh, one-on-one.

954
01:17:02,329 --> 01:17:06,520
Gino versus Dodo.

955
01:17:06,520 --> 01:17:08,560
Can't do anything besides attack normally.

956
01:17:18,310 --> 01:17:21,220
Toy versus a bird.

957
01:17:21,220 --> 01:17:24,029
Yeah, what an exhilarating fight this will be.

958
01:17:29,050 --> 01:17:35,659
Wait, we're all good.

959
01:17:41,159 --> 01:17:43,920
Valentina kind of looks like, hey, Arnold.

960
01:17:43,920 --> 01:17:46,479
I'm just realizing this is the first time.

961
01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:50,239
It's like Stewie Griffin, or hey, Arnold.

962
01:17:50,239 --> 01:17:59,270
It's Stewie Griffin.

963
01:17:59,270 --> 01:18:03,310
The same like squished head.

964
01:18:03,310 --> 01:18:20,189
All right, here we go.

965
01:18:20,189 --> 01:18:28,840
No, 17 every time.

966
01:18:40,430 --> 01:18:49,539
No, I'm trying to, the timing's so hard.

967
01:18:49,539 --> 01:18:51,989
I'm trying to change it up.

968
01:18:51,989 --> 01:19:02,000
It's after 16 is where it becomes one frame, I believe.

969
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:03,840
Now, how do I, where's my emulator

970
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:11,159
where I can slow down time, like how everybody did this?

971
01:19:11,159 --> 01:19:13,979
Dodo, how could you lose already?

972
01:19:13,979 --> 01:19:15,779
Well, come on, get over here.

973
01:19:25,729 --> 01:19:31,800
Uh-oh, drain beam.

974
01:19:31,800 --> 01:19:34,800
All right, Gino still can't do anything.

975
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:37,760
All right, we're gonna go for,

976
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:39,560
we're gonna go for Dodo first.

977
01:19:39,560 --> 01:19:40,399
Sorry.

978
01:19:44,119 --> 01:20:16,279
Oh shit, stop hurting him.

979
01:20:16,279 --> 01:20:17,239
He's hurting me.

980
01:20:21,079 --> 01:20:23,130
Somebody's sick of mushroom here.

981
01:20:23,130 --> 01:20:26,489
No, I'll be fine.

982
01:20:26,489 --> 01:20:47,149
It's a max mushroom, why would I do that?

983
01:20:47,149 --> 01:20:49,609
How many was that?

984
01:20:49,609 --> 01:20:52,960
How many was that?

985
01:20:52,960 --> 01:20:55,279
18?

986
01:20:55,279 --> 01:20:57,439
Uh-oh, this is bad.

987
01:20:57,439 --> 01:20:58,600
This is really bad.

988
01:20:58,600 --> 01:21:00,119
Peach is dead.

989
01:21:00,119 --> 01:21:06,520
No, Peach is alive.

990
01:21:06,520 --> 01:21:09,289
This is more important, Gino.

991
01:21:12,810 --> 01:21:21,529
Ow, do it only with sound cues.

992
01:21:21,529 --> 01:21:23,920
That actually might be a better idea.

993
01:21:23,920 --> 01:21:37,319
Oops.

994
01:21:37,319 --> 01:21:42,829
Oh, sick, I just got 18.

995
01:21:42,829 --> 01:21:46,890
It's time, Peach can't do any heals.

996
01:21:46,890 --> 01:21:49,170
I'm gonna try doing it with sound next time.

997
01:21:49,170 --> 01:21:51,170
Should I do Lucky Jewel?

998
01:21:51,170 --> 01:21:52,210
I think it's time.

999
01:21:52,210 --> 01:21:54,489
We're gonna, Lucky Jewel, you ready?

1000
01:21:54,489 --> 01:21:55,329
At the end of this, we're gonna,

1001
01:21:55,329 --> 01:21:57,250
you guys have to get it right.

1002
01:21:57,250 --> 01:22:04,810
It's time for Lucky Jewel.

1003
01:22:04,810 --> 01:22:09,090
Lucky, there it is.

1004
01:22:09,090 --> 01:22:19,920
We are doubling something here.

1005
01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:21,640
You gotta use your shit.

1006
01:22:21,640 --> 01:22:24,479
I hold onto these items so much, it's just stupid.

1007
01:22:42,239 --> 01:22:43,640
211, see you later.

1008
01:22:53,800 --> 01:22:54,880
Lucky Jewel infinite, is it?

1009
01:22:54,880 --> 01:22:58,239
I thought it was just one time.

1010
01:22:58,239 --> 01:23:19,020
I'm gonna do this only with sound, you ready?

1011
01:23:19,020 --> 01:23:19,859
It didn't help.

1012
01:23:21,279 --> 01:23:22,119
What was that?

1013
01:23:24,949 --> 01:23:26,270
20.

1014
01:23:26,270 --> 01:23:31,989
Oh shit, I don't believe this.

1015
01:23:32,909 --> 01:23:33,750
The show's over, folks.

1016
01:23:33,750 --> 01:23:37,159
Dodo, let's get out of here.

1017
01:23:37,159 --> 01:23:38,520
All right, those of you that are not paying attention,

1018
01:23:38,520 --> 01:23:41,140
I need you to pay attention now.

1019
01:23:41,140 --> 01:23:44,529
So, come back over here,

1020
01:23:44,529 --> 01:23:46,010
because this is important.

1021
01:23:54,239 --> 01:24:00,359
There we go, this is 200 coins and 40 experience.

1022
01:24:00,359 --> 01:24:02,840
So we're gonna get 80 experience.

1023
01:24:02,840 --> 01:24:05,439
You ready?

1024
01:24:05,439 --> 01:24:06,920
Now this is important.

1025
01:24:06,920 --> 01:24:13,520
Here we go.

1026
01:24:13,520 --> 01:24:19,119
Which one?

1027
01:24:19,119 --> 01:24:22,760
We're gonna, the whole team will level up if we do this.

1028
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:23,640
We, I mean you.

1029
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:27,880
And by you, I mean 3,000 people here.

1030
01:24:27,880 --> 01:24:39,279
All of you.

1031
01:24:39,279 --> 01:24:45,079
All right, this is pretty unanimous.

1032
01:24:45,079 --> 01:24:48,359
It's 80 experience, so that's 100,

1033
01:24:48,359 --> 01:24:51,560
that's Bowser's gonna level up at least once.

1034
01:24:51,560 --> 01:24:53,319
Bowser's doubling his EXP.

1035
01:24:53,319 --> 01:25:11,329
That's 160, Peach level 17.

1036
01:25:11,329 --> 01:25:13,289
Nice job, guys, you did it.

1037
01:25:13,289 --> 01:25:14,369
You did it, you did it, you did it.

1038
01:25:14,369 --> 01:25:23,329
I'm very, very happy, very grateful.

1039
01:25:23,329 --> 01:25:26,100
More power.

1040
01:25:26,100 --> 01:25:27,539
What stat is good for Peach?

1041
01:25:29,100 --> 01:25:31,840
I would say reliably.

1042
01:25:31,840 --> 01:25:41,560
Magic, damage, magic, defense, and HP.

1043
01:25:41,560 --> 01:26:02,199
There's Malo.

1044
01:26:02,199 --> 01:26:04,800
Somebody says, hey, I have a question for you.

1045
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:07,119
Has anyone really been far even as decided to use

1046
01:26:07,119 --> 01:26:09,239
even though want to do look more like?

1047
01:26:09,239 --> 01:26:10,960
If you could let me know, I'd appreciate it.

1048
01:26:10,960 --> 01:26:17,970
Yes.

1049
01:26:17,970 --> 01:26:19,289
Magic it is.

1050
01:26:19,289 --> 01:26:20,689
Everybody levels up today.

1051
01:26:20,689 --> 01:26:21,529
Here comes another one.

1052
01:26:21,529 --> 01:26:22,729
Bowser, level 18.

1053
01:26:22,729 --> 01:26:23,569
All right, we gotta take this off.

1054
01:26:23,569 --> 01:26:25,729
Bowser's gonna be overleveled, but that's good.

1055
01:26:25,729 --> 01:26:30,699
We're gonna need it.

1056
01:26:30,699 --> 01:26:32,100
Bowser crush.

1057
01:26:32,140 --> 01:26:45,500
He has learned 100%.

1058
01:26:45,500 --> 01:26:52,970
Wow, that was almost 200 clicks at 100% on the website.

1059
01:26:52,970 --> 01:26:56,970
That's pretty remarkable.

1060
01:26:56,970 --> 01:27:03,069
And it's not even close, so 139.

1061
01:27:10,840 --> 01:27:15,789
Great, they're gone.

1062
01:27:15,789 --> 01:27:16,630
Hurry, let's go after her.

1063
01:27:16,630 --> 01:27:17,789
I know she has the key.

1064
01:27:20,789 --> 01:27:24,810
Ow, ow.

1065
01:27:24,810 --> 01:27:25,890
Huh, Mario, look.

1066
01:27:32,189 --> 01:27:45,989
I didn't mean to eat that.

1067
01:27:45,989 --> 01:27:47,670
That's cute.

1068
01:27:47,670 --> 01:27:54,470
That's very cute.

1069
01:27:54,470 --> 01:27:57,819
How adorable.

1070
01:27:57,859 --> 01:28:01,739
Mom, Dad, I'd like you to meet Mario

1071
01:28:01,739 --> 01:28:05,779
and my other travel companions.

1072
01:28:05,779 --> 01:28:06,619
What's that?

1073
01:28:06,619 --> 01:28:08,899
Oh, wow, did we understand you well.

1074
01:28:08,899 --> 01:28:12,710
I'm Bowser's father, King Lindus.

1075
01:28:12,710 --> 01:28:13,829
Hello, everyone.

1076
01:28:13,829 --> 01:28:17,390
Thank you so much for looking after my dear child.

1077
01:28:17,390 --> 01:28:20,600
Allow me to introduce everyone.

1078
01:28:20,600 --> 01:28:24,399
This is Princess Toastle from Mushroom Kingdom.

1079
01:28:24,399 --> 01:28:26,000
Ah, I haven't heard so much about you.

1080
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:29,319
May I have your autograph?

1081
01:28:29,319 --> 01:28:32,520
Don't embarrass Junior, dear.

1082
01:28:32,520 --> 01:28:34,119
Oh, never mind.

1083
01:28:34,119 --> 01:28:37,170
Who is this gentleman over in the middle here?

1084
01:28:37,170 --> 01:28:39,210
This is Super Mario.

1085
01:28:39,210 --> 01:28:41,560
He helped me from the start.

1086
01:28:41,560 --> 01:28:46,939
Why, sincerely thank you from the bottom of my heart.

1087
01:28:46,939 --> 01:28:51,180
You don't mean the Mario, the jumping Mario?

1088
01:28:51,180 --> 01:28:54,520
Autograph, please?

1089
01:28:54,520 --> 01:28:56,920
That's quite enough, dear.

1090
01:28:56,920 --> 01:28:59,399
Okay, all right, well, wait a moment.

1091
01:28:59,399 --> 01:29:04,140
Show him just a little jump, a tiny one will do.

1092
01:29:04,140 --> 01:29:06,750
Do the thing, Mario.

1093
01:29:06,750 --> 01:29:10,640
Make us all happy.

1094
01:29:10,640 --> 01:29:12,920
Oh, fantastic.

1095
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:15,159
Show me ever again later.

1096
01:29:15,159 --> 01:29:19,729
Ahem, and who do we have over here?

1097
01:29:19,729 --> 01:29:23,600
This is Bowser, leader of the Koopa Troop.

1098
01:29:23,600 --> 01:29:25,600
Oh, another famous person.

1099
01:29:25,600 --> 01:29:27,479
Oh, this is too much for me.

1100
01:29:27,479 --> 01:29:30,310
I must have your autograph.

1101
01:29:30,310 --> 01:29:33,319
Dear, behave yourself, please.

1102
01:29:33,319 --> 01:29:35,119
No, not even a scribble?

1103
01:29:35,119 --> 01:29:37,500
Okay, all right, well, fine.

1104
01:29:37,500 --> 01:29:39,779
Yes, yes, yes, I'm quite forgetting my manners.

1105
01:29:39,779 --> 01:29:43,189
Well, who do we have over here?

1106
01:29:43,189 --> 01:29:47,100
This is Gino, who I told you about before.

1107
01:29:47,140 --> 01:29:52,760
Oh, yes, the story about Star Street, oh, how awful.

1108
01:29:52,760 --> 01:29:57,100
That's Star Road.

1109
01:29:57,100 --> 01:29:59,460
By the way, a little before Valentina took over,

1110
01:29:59,460 --> 01:30:01,579
a large star fell into the volcano.

1111
01:30:04,119 --> 01:30:07,960
Well, the dreaded star dragon inhabits the volcano.

1112
01:30:07,960 --> 01:30:11,390
It's going to be tough for getting a star out of there.

1113
01:30:11,390 --> 01:30:15,680
Perhaps all of you working together could handle that least.

1114
01:30:15,680 --> 01:30:18,560
Why would I, as young, I...

1115
01:30:18,560 --> 01:30:19,640
Yes, dear, yeah, okay.

1116
01:30:19,640 --> 01:30:23,850
Now, once at the volcano, find Hinopio.

1117
01:30:23,850 --> 01:30:28,390
He'll be able to help you.

1118
01:30:28,390 --> 01:30:31,630
You be careful, Mellow.

1119
01:30:31,630 --> 01:30:33,750
Okay, Mom, but I probably won't come back

1120
01:30:33,750 --> 01:30:43,880
until we find the star.

1121
01:30:43,880 --> 01:30:45,079
What do you got back here?

1122
01:30:45,079 --> 01:30:48,420
Any treasures for me?

1123
01:30:48,420 --> 01:30:52,380
Yeah, yeah, mm-hmm, there it is.

1124
01:30:52,380 --> 01:31:01,140
Flower tab, I'll take it.

1125
01:31:01,140 --> 01:31:02,819
Okay, so now I'm gonna do something

1126
01:31:02,819 --> 01:31:04,819
that a lot of people don't know exists,

1127
01:31:04,819 --> 01:31:10,609
and even if you do, that's just the way it is.

1128
01:31:10,609 --> 01:31:14,630
I ain't gonna use it.

1129
01:31:14,630 --> 01:31:16,130
Not yet.

1130
01:31:16,130 --> 01:31:19,619
Oh, the bird.

1131
01:31:19,619 --> 01:31:23,279
There is a secret that I am about to get,

1132
01:31:23,279 --> 01:31:25,199
and there's a debate whether or not

1133
01:31:25,199 --> 01:31:27,869
you should actually put it on or not.

1134
01:31:27,869 --> 01:31:30,760
The king gave me another job as a guard.

1135
01:31:30,760 --> 01:31:32,640
Prince Mellow!

1136
01:31:32,640 --> 01:31:34,039
Thank you so much.

1137
01:31:34,039 --> 01:31:37,000
We were able to rescue my father with the key you gave us.

1138
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:38,279
Don't mention it.

1139
01:31:38,279 --> 01:31:42,039
Besides, it was you who actually rescued him.

1140
01:31:42,039 --> 01:31:44,069
Good luck in the future.

1141
01:31:44,069 --> 01:31:45,680
You too.

1142
01:31:45,680 --> 01:31:52,270
Prince, here, this is from me.

1143
01:31:52,270 --> 01:31:58,359
Please take it.

1144
01:31:58,359 --> 01:32:00,520
Did you know that there are hot springs?

1145
01:32:00,520 --> 01:32:04,869
Yes, I know.

1146
01:32:04,869 --> 01:32:08,409
That's a pogchamp moment right there, I would say.

1147
01:32:08,409 --> 01:32:09,930
Yeah, all the statues are back to normal.

1148
01:32:09,930 --> 01:32:11,649
This is no longer a bad play.

1149
01:32:11,649 --> 01:32:18,090
Look at this, look at this.

1150
01:32:18,090 --> 01:32:21,039
Everybody.

1151
01:32:21,039 --> 01:32:24,079
This statue, it seems so unworldly.

1152
01:32:25,770 --> 01:32:27,409
Came to see the king's statue collection.

1153
01:32:27,409 --> 01:32:36,210
I tell you, it's remarkable.

1154
01:32:36,210 --> 01:32:40,380
It's very cool.

1155
01:32:40,380 --> 01:32:53,390
All right, let's go in here.

1156
01:32:53,390 --> 01:32:54,630
Go pawn the statues.

1157
01:32:54,630 --> 01:33:01,720
Why would I do that?

1158
01:33:01,720 --> 01:33:02,560
What happened?

1159
01:33:02,560 --> 01:33:04,079
I left, did he eat the shoe?

1160
01:33:04,079 --> 01:33:14,779
Uh-huh, he missed it.

1161
01:33:14,779 --> 01:33:16,100
I had to delete the clip, though.

1162
01:33:16,100 --> 01:33:17,300
I deleted the pod.

1163
01:33:18,439 --> 01:33:21,600
All right, everybody, if you don't want to be spoiled

1164
01:33:21,600 --> 01:33:24,399
on Super Mario RPG's Secrets of the Seven Stars,

1165
01:33:24,399 --> 01:33:28,279
a secret in the game, please do yourself a favor

1166
01:33:28,279 --> 01:33:47,239
and you should have played this game 10 years ago.

1167
01:33:47,239 --> 01:33:48,520
No, not 20 years ago,

1168
01:33:48,520 --> 01:33:53,060
because it was re-released like four times 10 years ago.

1169
01:33:53,060 --> 01:33:54,060
I was too young.

1170
01:33:56,600 --> 01:33:59,109
Uh-oh, busted.

1171
01:33:59,109 --> 01:34:03,479
What do I do, what to do, what to do?

1172
01:34:04,399 --> 01:34:07,149
I'll give you this fertilizer if you let me go, okay?

1173
01:34:07,149 --> 01:34:17,859
Receive the fertilizer.

1174
01:34:17,859 --> 01:34:20,340
He just shit in a bucket and gave it to you.

1175
01:34:20,340 --> 01:34:25,720
Well, maybe so.

1176
01:34:25,720 --> 01:34:26,800
Ready?

1177
01:34:26,800 --> 01:34:28,039
Let's go.

1178
01:34:29,039 --> 01:34:31,920
Let's go, let's go, let's go, do it.

1179
01:34:31,920 --> 01:34:36,770
But first, let's go to the hot springs.

1180
01:34:36,770 --> 01:34:37,609
Hey, you're the real prince.

1181
01:34:37,609 --> 01:34:39,210
Sorry about the misunderstanding before.

1182
01:34:39,210 --> 01:34:41,890
There's no way that fat bird could have been a prince.

1183
01:34:42,909 --> 01:34:44,229
No big deal.

1184
01:34:44,229 --> 01:34:46,630
Anyway, do you think you could let us through?

1185
01:34:46,630 --> 01:34:48,520
Of course.

1186
01:34:48,520 --> 01:34:51,609
Go right ahead and enjoy yourself.

1187
01:34:51,609 --> 01:34:56,699
But be careful not to fall into the volcano.

1188
01:34:56,699 --> 01:34:57,699
Let's go relax.

1189
01:35:02,119 --> 01:35:04,520
This part of the game, I remember every time I did this,

1190
01:35:04,520 --> 01:35:14,840
I always wanted to go take a bath.

1191
01:35:14,840 --> 01:35:19,479
Woo, too hot.

1192
01:35:19,479 --> 01:35:20,560
Well, you did it wrong, Mario.

1193
01:35:20,560 --> 01:35:22,359
You're supposed to go in feet first

1194
01:35:22,359 --> 01:35:24,920
and then after two minutes, you put your legs in.

1195
01:35:24,920 --> 01:35:25,880
Then you put your butt in.

1196
01:35:25,880 --> 01:35:28,319
After five minutes, you put your stomach in.

1197
01:35:28,319 --> 01:35:29,600
You don't just go all in.

1198
01:35:34,199 --> 01:35:37,039
Danger beyond the cliffs is the volcano.

1199
01:35:37,720 --> 01:35:42,920
Yeah, but we're not doing that yet.

1200
01:35:42,920 --> 01:35:44,399
I've got some secrets to do.

1201
01:35:54,680 --> 01:35:55,520
Here we go.

1202
01:35:58,659 --> 01:36:00,340
Have pants for Mallow to buy?

1203
01:36:02,319 --> 01:36:05,210
Not yet.

1204
01:36:05,210 --> 01:36:06,050
In a moment.

1205
01:36:14,159 --> 01:36:16,399
Remember the seed we gave to this guy

1206
01:36:16,399 --> 01:36:17,920
like four or five hours ago?

1207
01:36:18,939 --> 01:36:23,510
And by that, I mean like stream four or five hours ago.

1208
01:36:23,510 --> 01:36:24,350
Here we go.

1209
01:36:27,359 --> 01:36:28,439
Hey, guys, do you know what you have there?

1210
01:36:28,439 --> 01:36:29,920
That fertilizer comes from the Shia Way clan,

1211
01:36:29,920 --> 01:36:31,479
famous for its miraculous feeds of godly.

1212
01:36:31,479 --> 01:36:32,359
I looked over at beyond the cliffs

1213
01:36:32,399 --> 01:36:33,520
and I tried Bean Valley, but failed.

1214
01:36:33,520 --> 01:36:35,239
I traveled around the world and waited.

1215
01:36:35,239 --> 01:36:36,899
You have the fertilizer on the...

1216
01:36:36,899 --> 01:36:39,649
Oh, short attention span?

1217
01:36:39,649 --> 01:36:42,529
Yes, you might say I have fertilizer on the brain.

1218
01:36:42,529 --> 01:36:44,409
Will you give it to me?

1219
01:36:44,409 --> 01:36:45,810
Sure.

1220
01:36:45,810 --> 01:36:47,090
Oh, thank you.

1221
01:36:47,090 --> 01:36:49,689
I finally have both the seed and the fertilizer.

1222
01:36:49,689 --> 01:36:55,659
I'll try them out right away.

1223
01:36:55,659 --> 01:37:05,680
I'll plant the seed, then give it fertilizer.

1224
01:37:05,680 --> 01:37:08,880
Nothing's happening.

1225
01:37:08,880 --> 01:37:10,659
Whoa.

1226
01:37:10,659 --> 01:37:15,359
Oh, what?

1227
01:37:15,359 --> 01:37:17,390
This is amazing.

1228
01:37:17,390 --> 01:37:18,229
This is unreal.

1229
01:37:18,229 --> 01:37:19,069
This is just like winning the lottery

1230
01:37:19,069 --> 01:37:19,909
only without the taxes.

1231
01:37:19,949 --> 01:37:21,069
I mean, this is like falling out of an airplane

1232
01:37:21,069 --> 01:37:22,149
without a parachute and hitting a ground

1233
01:37:22,149 --> 01:37:23,310
with geese and a man who'll break you fall.

1234
01:37:23,310 --> 01:37:24,670
Wait a minute, my buddies here about Happy Gardner's

1235
01:37:24,670 --> 01:37:25,510
one of your mothers.

1236
01:37:25,510 --> 01:37:27,079
I'm gonna be famous.

1237
01:37:27,079 --> 01:37:31,210
You think I could use a little more fertilizer?

1238
01:37:31,210 --> 01:37:36,800
Oops, maybe not, huh?

1239
01:37:36,800 --> 01:37:41,060
This will get me in Happy Gardner monthly magazine.

1240
01:37:41,060 --> 01:37:43,229
Hmm?

1241
01:37:43,229 --> 01:37:48,279
Don't mind if I climb this.

1242
01:37:48,279 --> 01:37:51,039
Hey, what do we got here?

1243
01:37:51,039 --> 01:37:53,500
Hmm.

1244
01:37:53,500 --> 01:37:56,180
Boom, you got the lazy shell

1245
01:37:56,180 --> 01:38:00,960
and you got the lazy shell.

1246
01:38:00,960 --> 01:38:04,800
Ladies and gentlemen, I hope you're paying attention

1247
01:38:04,840 --> 01:38:09,760
because this is the best armor in the game

1248
01:38:09,760 --> 01:38:11,399
besides one other item, I believe.

1249
01:38:11,399 --> 01:38:17,810
Look at those stat changes.

1250
01:38:17,810 --> 01:38:20,810
To give you a little bit of a look at that, 63 defense

1251
01:38:22,199 --> 01:38:23,760
and there's also a weapon.

1252
01:38:23,760 --> 01:38:31,779
Look at that, 198 damage.

1253
01:38:31,779 --> 01:38:35,720
Now, anybody can wear the lazy shell

1254
01:38:35,720 --> 01:38:38,319
and essentially what it does is it makes that person

1255
01:38:38,319 --> 01:38:44,289
100% unkillable.

1256
01:38:44,289 --> 01:38:49,090
Whoever wears the lazy shell will not fucking die.

1257
01:38:49,130 --> 01:38:52,810
It is impossible.

1258
01:38:52,810 --> 01:38:57,359
It's great, it's really good,

1259
01:38:57,359 --> 01:38:59,920
but we're not gonna use it right now.

1260
01:38:59,920 --> 01:39:01,319
It's cheating.

1261
01:39:01,319 --> 01:39:05,640
I will use the weapon or will I?

1262
01:39:05,640 --> 01:39:07,079
Maybe, I don't know.

1263
01:39:07,079 --> 01:39:10,260
Should I?

1264
01:39:10,260 --> 01:39:16,510
Not this early, not this early.

1265
01:39:16,510 --> 01:39:19,260
Look at the magic attack though.

1266
01:39:19,260 --> 01:39:22,560
It makes you completely useless.

1267
01:39:22,560 --> 01:39:26,520
It drags you down so hard in magic and attack

1268
01:39:26,520 --> 01:39:28,840
but it makes the person unable to die.

1269
01:39:28,880 --> 01:39:30,560
Should I give it to Peach?

1270
01:39:30,560 --> 01:39:32,000
Yeah, I will, I will eventually.

1271
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:35,680
But no, I just have it, I have it.

1272
01:39:35,680 --> 01:39:37,399
I have the two essentially best weapons

1273
01:39:37,399 --> 01:39:39,000
and the best item in the game.

1274
01:39:40,460 --> 01:39:43,859
So, you know, I'll use it when I need to.

1275
01:39:43,859 --> 01:39:46,420
Like when I fight Kulex.

1276
01:39:49,029 --> 01:39:50,630
Because I'll fucking win.

1277
01:39:50,630 --> 01:40:00,069
I will beat Kulex with the lazy shell on

1278
01:40:00,069 --> 01:40:04,710
because that's how everybody beats Kulex.

1279
01:40:04,710 --> 01:40:07,920
Hey shit, use item, I will.

1280
01:40:07,920 --> 01:40:11,170
Hold on, there's more to see.

1281
01:40:11,170 --> 01:40:19,500
Not yet, just hold on a minute.

1282
01:40:19,500 --> 01:40:21,859
So there are a few more areas left to go.

1283
01:40:24,449 --> 01:40:31,569
Use that item or I'm gonna go to sleep.

1284
01:40:31,569 --> 01:40:39,359
Have a good night.

1285
01:40:39,359 --> 01:40:40,359
I'm going to use it.

1286
01:40:42,010 --> 01:40:43,850
You're using hacks on Kulex.

1287
01:40:44,850 --> 01:40:49,680
That's not, it's in the game.

1288
01:40:49,680 --> 01:40:50,880
It's in the game.

1289
01:40:56,399 --> 01:40:58,880
All right, I have to, I gotta pee.

1290
01:40:58,880 --> 01:41:00,800
No, I'm gonna hold my pee for a minute.

1291
01:41:00,800 --> 01:41:04,560
Let me get to the next town.

1292
01:41:04,560 --> 01:41:06,640
All right, I gotta go to the hot springs and then go down.

1293
01:41:06,640 --> 01:41:08,159
But I'm gonna buy the pants.

1294
01:41:08,159 --> 01:41:09,079
No, I'm not, why would I do that?

1295
01:41:09,079 --> 01:41:25,869
I'm about to go to a new area.

1296
01:41:25,869 --> 01:41:27,109
Time for the volcano.

1297
01:41:32,600 --> 01:41:34,819
I love that.

1298
01:41:34,819 --> 01:41:59,460
I also love this song.

1299
01:41:59,460 --> 01:42:00,300
Bower tab.

1300
01:42:03,600 --> 01:42:06,199
The bass guitar is objectively the best instrument.

1301
01:42:07,640 --> 01:42:10,479
I think it's one of the most important instruments.

1302
01:42:14,199 --> 01:42:29,329
I think it's one of the most important ones.

1303
01:42:29,329 --> 01:42:30,930
Bracer.

1304
01:42:30,930 --> 01:42:34,359
I have some of the items I gotta get rid of.

1305
01:42:34,359 --> 01:42:37,079
Because we are getting towards the end game here.

1306
01:42:37,079 --> 01:42:41,619
You know what I'm saying?

1307
01:42:41,619 --> 01:42:56,550
Oh, that just kind of creeped off on me.

1308
01:42:56,550 --> 01:43:03,010
Mario, leveled up.

1309
01:43:03,010 --> 01:43:22,560
Very good, very good, very good.

1310
01:43:22,560 --> 01:43:26,239
Where does Mario RPG sit on my favorite all time games list?

1311
01:43:27,159 --> 01:43:29,800
There are five probably that are all in the same spot.

1312
01:43:30,840 --> 01:43:36,800
Power.

1313
01:43:36,800 --> 01:43:43,140
I cannot decide.

1314
01:43:43,140 --> 01:43:48,130
Geno flash.

1315
01:43:48,130 --> 01:43:53,409
That would have been a really cool final smash.

1316
01:43:53,409 --> 01:43:54,449
You'll see it.

1317
01:43:54,449 --> 01:44:08,609
I'll show it to you.

1318
01:44:08,609 --> 01:44:19,859
All right, super 87 magic attack.

1319
01:44:20,020 --> 01:44:23,130
I gotta go this way.

1320
01:44:23,130 --> 01:44:23,970
How much money do I have?

1321
01:44:23,970 --> 01:44:25,010
Nine, nine, nine?

1322
01:44:25,010 --> 01:44:26,489
Almost, six, six, three.

1323
01:44:33,109 --> 01:44:34,510
Why don't we take a look at it?

1324
01:44:34,510 --> 01:44:37,819
This is Geno flash.

1325
01:44:37,819 --> 01:44:49,859
The ultimate move.

1326
01:44:49,859 --> 01:45:03,640
He turns into a cannon and he shoots out the sun.

1327
01:45:03,640 --> 01:45:05,039
It sucks.

1328
01:45:05,039 --> 01:45:07,239
What?

1329
01:45:07,239 --> 01:45:08,079
It doesn't suck.

1330
01:45:10,960 --> 01:45:24,180
Look, I'll show you again.

1331
01:45:24,180 --> 01:45:26,779
That's 440 damage.

1332
01:45:26,779 --> 01:45:29,699
It sucks 440 damage?

1333
01:45:29,699 --> 01:45:30,899
Have you been counting?

1334
01:45:37,609 --> 01:45:40,939
Frog coin, how do I get that?

1335
01:45:40,939 --> 01:45:45,079
Oh, you gotta jump.

1336
01:45:45,079 --> 01:45:46,600
Ah, come on, I can get it.

1337
01:46:07,300 --> 01:46:20,789
I gotta get rid of all these things.

1338
01:46:20,789 --> 01:46:22,229
We're gonna have to fight two or three things

1339
01:46:22,229 --> 01:46:23,069
back to back to back here.

1340
01:46:23,069 --> 01:46:33,920
It's all right, I'm just gonna Geno blast him.

1341
01:46:33,920 --> 01:46:41,680
Just gonna do that twice.

1342
01:46:41,680 --> 01:46:43,279
Get rid of Peach and use Bowser.

1343
01:46:43,279 --> 01:46:46,039
When I get a new weapon for Bowser, yes.

1344
01:46:46,039 --> 01:46:50,880
But his current weapon right now hurts everybody's eyes.

1345
01:46:50,880 --> 01:46:52,039
That's the sad truth.

1346
01:46:58,909 --> 01:47:01,670
All right, didn't get it.

1347
01:47:06,829 --> 01:47:09,329
Okay, how are we doing on health?

1348
01:47:09,329 --> 01:47:10,170
Not great.

1349
01:47:18,199 --> 01:47:20,000
What am I gonna do with stream points?

1350
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:23,409
I'll figure out something.

1351
01:47:23,409 --> 01:47:25,689
I don't think I even have access to them right now.

1352
01:47:25,689 --> 01:47:37,619
Are they in like beta?

1353
01:47:37,619 --> 01:47:42,300
I think I would do something stupid where, you know, some,

1354
01:47:42,300 --> 01:47:43,739
okay, you know, remember when Pepsi had the thing

1355
01:47:43,739 --> 01:47:45,140
where you could get the jet

1356
01:47:45,140 --> 01:47:47,500
for like a hundred million Pepsi points?

1357
01:47:49,170 --> 01:47:51,890
But what if like, what if like a hundred million

1358
01:47:51,890 --> 01:47:52,850
germ of twitch points?

1359
01:47:52,850 --> 01:47:55,210
Like I like flew out to like your neighborhood

1360
01:47:55,210 --> 01:47:56,810
and we like went and got lunch.

1361
01:48:00,199 --> 01:48:08,159
You need to get like a hundred fucking million.

1362
01:48:08,159 --> 01:48:10,399
That's some bullshit.

1363
01:48:14,810 --> 01:48:19,020
I come to your house.

1364
01:48:19,020 --> 01:48:24,340
That's no, that's some like Nickelodeon shit.

1365
01:48:24,340 --> 01:48:28,260
Nickelodeon presents Nicktoons come to your neighborhood.

1366
01:48:28,260 --> 01:48:41,319
I think they did something like that before, didn't they?

1367
01:48:41,319 --> 01:48:47,800
I think they did.

1368
01:48:47,800 --> 01:48:49,680
I think you get 10 points per half hour.

1369
01:48:49,680 --> 01:48:50,720
How long is that?

1370
01:48:54,649 --> 01:48:58,449
That may be like four to 500 years.

1371
01:49:03,199 --> 01:49:21,539
A hundred million coins and then we get to like miss.

1372
01:49:21,539 --> 01:49:25,720
Bowser level 19.

1373
01:49:25,720 --> 01:49:31,859
Where to?

1374
01:49:31,859 --> 01:49:40,149
Pull the coins.

1375
01:49:40,149 --> 01:49:43,229
Once again, chat is split on HP.

1376
01:49:43,229 --> 01:49:46,510
Well, if Bowser is eventually gonna get the lazy shell,

1377
01:49:46,510 --> 01:49:52,819
then I would start focusing on defense.

1378
01:49:54,989 --> 01:50:00,960
That's just me and it's you picking.

1379
01:50:00,960 --> 01:50:14,220
So, oh, come on.

1380
01:50:14,220 --> 01:50:18,050
Frog coin up there.

1381
01:50:18,050 --> 01:50:20,300
How do I get that frog coin?

1382
01:50:20,300 --> 01:50:42,239
That bingo, 380.

1383
01:50:43,319 --> 01:50:44,680
I gotta take a maple syrup.

1384
01:50:44,680 --> 01:50:45,760
I know I got a flower jar.

1385
01:50:45,760 --> 01:50:53,079
I'll just use that.

1386
01:50:53,079 --> 01:50:54,600
Go pee.

1387
01:50:54,600 --> 01:50:55,439
Yeah, I will.

1388
01:50:55,439 --> 01:50:57,569
Once I get to the new safe point, I will go pee.

1389
01:50:57,569 --> 01:51:02,810
I promise.

1390
01:51:02,810 --> 01:51:16,989
But I gotta get these frog coins first.

1391
01:51:16,989 --> 01:51:21,869
What the hell is this thing?

1392
01:51:21,869 --> 01:51:23,149
Where is it?

1393
01:51:23,149 --> 01:51:24,510
What plane is this on?

1394
01:51:25,720 --> 01:51:32,510
Oh, it was forward.

1395
01:51:32,510 --> 01:51:33,829
Come on, I already killed them.

1396
01:51:33,829 --> 01:51:44,250
I have to jump from here.

1397
01:51:44,250 --> 01:51:54,699
Get that, come on.

1398
01:51:54,699 --> 01:52:33,479
Dammit, I can't go that way.

1399
01:52:37,439 --> 01:52:39,079
Hey, listen, listen.

1400
01:52:39,079 --> 01:52:41,439
Listen, guys, I can't jump from here.

1401
01:52:42,560 --> 01:52:43,800
Okay, there was an invisible wall there.

1402
01:52:43,800 --> 01:52:45,039
I promise, I swear to God.

1403
01:52:45,039 --> 01:52:46,560
I swear on everything.

1404
01:52:46,560 --> 01:52:48,720
I do, rewind.

1405
01:52:48,720 --> 01:52:50,119
I actually tried to jump.

1406
01:52:50,119 --> 01:52:51,199
Did you see it?

1407
01:52:51,199 --> 01:52:52,039
I swear to God.

1408
01:52:52,039 --> 01:52:57,439
Go back, rewind.

1409
01:52:57,439 --> 01:52:58,439
I tried.

1410
01:52:58,439 --> 01:52:59,279
I did.

1411
01:52:59,279 --> 01:53:00,119
I swear to God.

1412
01:53:04,840 --> 01:53:11,880
I wasn't ready for this.

1413
01:53:11,880 --> 01:53:12,920
I tried to jump over there.

1414
01:53:12,920 --> 01:53:14,600
It didn't work.

1415
01:53:14,600 --> 01:53:18,869
I tried.

1416
01:53:18,869 --> 01:53:43,100
You can Lucky Jewel every single time.

1417
01:53:43,100 --> 01:53:47,680
I bet I haven't used that at every single boss.

1418
01:53:47,680 --> 01:53:49,989
I did not know that.

1419
01:53:49,989 --> 01:54:07,079
This monster's getting furious.

1420
01:54:07,079 --> 01:54:10,979
Get rid of him.

1421
01:54:10,979 --> 01:54:15,510
Shit.

1422
01:54:15,510 --> 01:54:16,829
Va-va-voom.

1423
01:54:16,829 --> 01:54:19,310
Oh, no, wait.

1424
01:54:19,310 --> 01:54:20,949
I think that kills somebody.

1425
01:54:20,949 --> 01:54:21,789
No, it doesn't.

1426
01:54:23,449 --> 01:54:25,250
I have to take a...

1427
01:54:25,250 --> 01:54:26,170
No, I don't.

1428
01:54:26,170 --> 01:54:29,350
Wait a minute.

1429
01:54:29,350 --> 01:54:32,380
Should I summon Yoshi?

1430
01:54:32,380 --> 01:54:36,159
9415.

1431
01:54:36,159 --> 01:54:37,000
I'm going for it.

1432
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:37,840
This is a bad idea.

1433
01:54:37,840 --> 01:54:39,359
Really stupid, but he'll die right now.

1434
01:54:39,359 --> 01:54:40,680
Yep, okay.

1435
01:54:40,680 --> 01:54:41,920
Once again, defense up.

1436
01:54:41,920 --> 01:54:43,199
We're fine.

1437
01:54:43,199 --> 01:54:46,989
Just walk it.

1438
01:54:46,989 --> 01:54:47,949
I have a flower jar.

1439
01:54:47,949 --> 01:55:11,800
I don't want to waste anything.

1440
01:55:11,800 --> 01:55:16,859
Lucky, I didn't even need to use it.

1441
01:55:16,859 --> 01:55:19,939
Killer Crocomar, I just get $50.

1442
01:55:19,939 --> 01:55:22,340
5,000 bits from Killer Crocomar.

1443
01:55:22,340 --> 01:55:25,119
Thank you, Crocomar.

1444
01:55:25,119 --> 01:55:26,359
Huge money drop.

1445
01:55:26,359 --> 01:55:29,079
Big bits.

1446
01:55:29,079 --> 01:55:31,399
Sam and Max died for this, and I'm okay with that.

1447
01:55:31,399 --> 01:55:34,000
As long as you do all the Paper Mario series.

1448
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:39,909
Also, you better Jex it out on Q-Legs.

1449
01:55:39,909 --> 01:55:41,710
Yeah, I do want to finish Sam and Max,

1450
01:55:41,710 --> 01:55:45,909
but I didn't really like season three.

1451
01:55:45,909 --> 01:55:48,859
The first episode just didn't do it for me.

1452
01:55:48,859 --> 01:55:53,560
I will finish it.

1453
01:55:53,560 --> 01:55:55,119
Never lied about finishing Sam and Max

1454
01:55:55,119 --> 01:55:56,760
season three, episode two through five.

1455
01:55:56,760 --> 01:55:58,159
Just make the username now.

1456
01:55:59,159 --> 01:56:00,119
All right, let's double the coins.

1457
01:56:00,119 --> 01:56:05,489
You paying attention?

1458
01:56:05,489 --> 01:56:21,979
We're at one.

1459
01:56:21,979 --> 01:56:22,819
I wasn't looking.

1460
01:56:22,819 --> 01:56:23,659
Do it again.

1461
01:56:24,539 --> 01:56:25,579
I'm going to go with the audience here.

1462
01:56:25,579 --> 01:56:28,979
31% says left, let's go, and you got it wrong.

1463
01:56:29,819 --> 01:56:30,659
It's okay, you didn't lose anything.

1464
01:56:30,659 --> 01:56:31,500
You tried.

1465
01:56:31,500 --> 01:56:36,739
It was very close.

1466
01:56:36,739 --> 01:56:41,109
I need to use that flower box,

1467
01:56:41,109 --> 01:56:43,789
because I have no flower power.

1468
01:56:43,789 --> 01:56:45,149
There it is.

1469
01:56:45,149 --> 01:56:46,109
81, nice.

1470
01:56:46,109 --> 01:56:46,949
All right.

1471
01:56:46,949 --> 01:56:48,189
I still have to go back to,

1472
01:56:48,189 --> 01:56:49,789
I got to bring this to the guy.

1473
01:56:51,470 --> 01:56:53,710
Okay, so that means let me do this.

1474
01:57:04,159 --> 01:57:07,560
But am I going to play Paper Mario?

1475
01:57:07,560 --> 01:57:09,399
I don't know.

1476
01:57:09,399 --> 01:57:14,250
I don't know.

1477
01:57:14,250 --> 01:57:15,090
All right, time to pee.

1478
01:57:15,090 --> 01:59:51,529
I'll be right back.

1479
01:59:51,529 --> 01:59:53,810
Nobody noticed anything weird about Germans pee this time.

1480
01:59:53,810 --> 02:00:04,140
Yeah, I guess you tell me.

1481
02:00:04,140 --> 02:00:07,220
We're also getting to one of my favorite parts

1482
02:00:07,220 --> 02:00:09,979
of the whole game.

1483
02:00:09,979 --> 02:00:22,640
And I cannot wait to act it out for you.

1484
02:00:22,640 --> 02:00:31,380
Damn it.

1485
02:00:31,380 --> 02:00:33,460
And then we have the series of doors

1486
02:00:33,460 --> 02:00:36,180
which you guys are going to pick.

1487
02:00:36,180 --> 02:00:39,100
Lots of chat participation coming up

1488
02:00:39,100 --> 02:00:41,340
in the next 45 minutes or so.

1489
02:00:58,689 --> 02:01:09,310
Let's go.

1490
02:01:09,310 --> 02:01:10,630
No, I wanted to jump.

1491
02:01:10,630 --> 02:01:29,720
I forgot to jump right at the end.

1492
02:01:29,720 --> 02:01:31,979
Comes the anger.

1493
02:01:31,979 --> 02:01:35,750
Tree stump is furious.

1494
02:01:35,750 --> 02:01:37,350
The monster's getting furious.

1495
02:01:47,810 --> 02:01:50,680
I forgot to refill my drink.

1496
02:01:50,680 --> 02:01:55,390
I'm so focused on peeing.

1497
02:01:55,390 --> 02:01:59,560
Peach level 18.

1498
02:01:59,560 --> 02:02:02,000
Psych bomb.

1499
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:05,930
I'm not sure I've ever used this move.

1500
02:02:05,930 --> 02:02:07,050
Is that the final,

1501
02:02:07,050 --> 02:02:25,880
is that Peach's final smash?

1502
02:02:25,880 --> 02:02:27,210
All right.

1503
02:02:27,210 --> 02:02:30,460
Flower or I wish I could click the flower.

1504
02:02:30,460 --> 02:02:32,020
Maybe it would give me something.

1505
02:02:42,840 --> 02:02:44,920
Going underneath the frog stone frog.

1506
02:02:44,920 --> 02:02:46,479
Can I do it?

1507
02:02:46,479 --> 02:02:48,520
Can I go underneath stone frog?

1508
02:02:48,520 --> 02:03:03,289
Lift up, stone frog, whatever.

1509
02:03:03,289 --> 02:03:04,130
Let's get rid of you.

1510
02:03:04,130 --> 02:03:05,210
Can I, you know what?

1511
02:03:05,210 --> 02:03:06,569
Psych bomb.

1512
02:03:06,569 --> 02:03:16,350
Let's do it.

1513
02:03:16,350 --> 02:03:18,350
All right.

1514
02:03:18,350 --> 02:03:29,050
Why does Peach have bombs?

1515
02:03:29,050 --> 02:03:32,670
Migraine.

1516
02:03:32,670 --> 02:03:35,739
I think that does all of their health.

1517
02:03:35,739 --> 02:03:41,750
We're gonna have to check in on that.

1518
02:03:41,750 --> 02:03:42,590
What are these?

1519
02:03:42,590 --> 02:03:44,569
Yeah, damn it.

1520
02:03:44,569 --> 02:03:45,890
Special.

1521
02:03:54,380 --> 02:03:56,100
Did I land on the thing or,

1522
02:03:56,100 --> 02:03:56,939
God damn it.

1523
02:03:56,939 --> 02:03:58,060
It's all right, geno blast.

1524
02:03:58,060 --> 02:03:59,300
Geno flash, let's go.

1525
02:04:07,050 --> 02:04:08,930
Everybody.

1526
02:04:08,930 --> 02:04:09,770
In one go.

1527
02:04:09,770 --> 02:04:11,079
Let's see it.

1528
02:04:11,079 --> 02:04:18,039
Oh, that always feels good.

1529
02:04:18,039 --> 02:04:23,600
18 for Mallow.

1530
02:04:23,600 --> 02:04:25,680
Star rain.

1531
02:04:25,680 --> 02:04:26,760
Mallow's final move.

1532
02:04:29,880 --> 02:04:31,239
How close am I to the end?

1533
02:04:32,840 --> 02:04:35,039
This is the second to last.

1534
02:04:35,039 --> 02:04:36,039
Well, no, this is the,

1535
02:04:36,039 --> 02:04:36,880
this is the three,

1536
02:04:36,880 --> 02:04:40,380
there's two more areas after this area, technically.

1537
02:04:41,340 --> 02:04:46,770
So we're at about the 85 percentile through the game.

1538
02:04:48,060 --> 02:04:51,380
We're nearing the end of the game, yes.

1539
02:04:51,380 --> 02:04:57,239
We're late, game.

1540
02:04:57,239 --> 02:04:59,819
Let me sleep.

1541
02:04:59,819 --> 02:05:07,180
The stream just started two hours ago.

1542
02:05:07,180 --> 02:05:14,550
Let me sleep.

1543
02:05:14,550 --> 02:05:18,399
Ah, shit.

1544
02:05:18,399 --> 02:05:24,659
Do it again.

1545
02:05:24,659 --> 02:05:26,880
It's four a.m. here.

1546
02:05:26,880 --> 02:05:40,909
Well, it's like 5.30 here, p.m.

1547
02:05:40,909 --> 02:05:42,579
Let me sleep.

1548
02:05:42,579 --> 02:05:54,369
I'm so tired.

1549
02:05:54,369 --> 02:05:56,090
Big bits, more big bits.

1550
02:05:56,090 --> 02:06:02,510
More, more.

1551
02:06:02,510 --> 02:06:05,359
Five, 50 bucks from Killer Crocomire.

1552
02:06:05,359 --> 02:06:07,039
That's 100 bucks from Killer Crocomire.

1553
02:06:07,800 --> 02:06:12,640
So far, Crocomire, big money.

1554
02:06:12,640 --> 02:06:19,159
Huge cash drop.

1555
02:06:19,159 --> 02:06:21,510
Shit, I was trying to do something sneaky.

1556
02:06:21,510 --> 02:06:22,630
And they say,

1557
02:06:22,630 --> 02:06:27,189
don't act like you didn't evade that Paper Mario question.

1558
02:06:27,189 --> 02:06:29,229
Oh, if I was, didn't I say I was,

1559
02:06:29,229 --> 02:06:31,390
I was probably not gonna do it?

1560
02:06:31,390 --> 02:06:36,579
I think I said that at like a couple of streams ago, maybe?

1561
02:06:36,579 --> 02:06:38,420
I don't have any plans to play Paper Mario.

1562
02:06:38,420 --> 02:06:39,739
Let's just put it that way.

1563
02:06:39,739 --> 02:06:44,119
So, but I didn't have any plans to play this, did I?

1564
02:06:44,199 --> 02:06:46,359
Somebody actually said that I said I was gonna,

1565
02:06:46,359 --> 02:06:47,760
the only reason why I would stream this game

1566
02:06:47,760 --> 02:06:50,520
is if I had like a mental breakdown or something, right?

1567
02:06:52,720 --> 02:06:55,319
I never planned on everything and I was gonna do this.

1568
02:06:55,319 --> 02:06:56,159
So, I don't know.

1569
02:06:57,720 --> 02:06:58,560
Evading the question,

1570
02:06:58,560 --> 02:07:00,600
I just said the answer was probably no.

1571
02:07:02,289 --> 02:07:05,010
That's me answering the question.

1572
02:07:05,010 --> 02:07:07,329
Evading the question would be,

1573
02:07:07,329 --> 02:07:09,050
are you gonna play Paper Mario?

1574
02:07:09,050 --> 02:07:10,949
And then I say,

1575
02:07:10,949 --> 02:07:12,909
well, you know,

1576
02:07:12,909 --> 02:07:15,310
it actually is supposed to be raining.

1577
02:07:15,310 --> 02:07:18,090
I think it's supposed to rain tomorrow.

1578
02:07:18,090 --> 02:07:21,520
And then I just go back to normal.

1579
02:07:21,520 --> 02:07:30,020
That's it.

1580
02:07:30,020 --> 02:07:31,619
Stop evading the question.

1581
02:07:31,619 --> 02:07:32,619
Bario's,

1582
02:07:32,619 --> 02:07:34,380
Bario,

1583
02:07:34,380 --> 02:07:35,500
oh, good for Bario.

1584
02:07:35,500 --> 02:07:38,079
He's now level 20.

1585
02:07:38,079 --> 02:07:39,239
They all say, keep up the good content

1586
02:07:39,239 --> 02:07:40,680
and hope you do the dunk tank stream

1587
02:07:40,680 --> 02:07:42,439
before winter rolls in.

1588
02:07:42,439 --> 02:07:43,279
I'm not sure if you've been here,

1589
02:07:43,279 --> 02:07:46,399
but September 21st is not just gonna be a dunk tank.

1590
02:07:46,399 --> 02:07:48,960
It's gonna be like a six hour carnival

1591
02:07:48,960 --> 02:07:52,520
with a shitload of chat controlled carnival games.

1592
02:07:52,520 --> 02:07:58,579
September 21st, hope to see you there.

1593
02:07:58,579 --> 02:07:59,579
But thank you.

1594
02:07:59,579 --> 02:08:01,640
Seriously, Crocmar.

1595
02:08:01,640 --> 02:08:03,039
That's a lot of fucking money.

1596
02:08:03,039 --> 02:08:12,760
Too much money.

1597
02:08:12,760 --> 02:08:14,319
Rose and dunk tank.

1598
02:08:14,319 --> 02:08:28,560
No, it'll be too cold to do it then.

1599
02:08:28,560 --> 02:08:31,560
Ball weight, nine, 13.

1600
02:08:31,560 --> 02:08:32,399
No.

1601
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:37,579
I feel like you guys don't care about this anymore.

1602
02:08:37,579 --> 02:08:40,460
Cause once we've gone majority clicking right flower,

1603
02:08:40,460 --> 02:08:43,460
I think that I should just start picking these.

1604
02:08:43,460 --> 02:08:49,270
Cause like that's majority right flower.

1605
02:08:49,310 --> 02:08:54,529
I think the novelty may have worn off.

1606
02:08:54,529 --> 02:08:57,449
Hold on, I think Otto is like,

1607
02:08:57,449 --> 02:08:58,329
is Otto trying to get in here?

1608
02:08:58,329 --> 02:09:42,159
Hold on.

1609
02:09:42,159 --> 02:09:43,800
Sorry about that.

1610
02:09:43,800 --> 02:09:44,640
I just heard him bark.

1611
02:09:44,640 --> 02:09:47,359
He was barking at my bedroom door.

1612
02:09:47,359 --> 02:09:49,819
Not here.

1613
02:09:49,819 --> 02:09:51,460
Cause the bedroom door was closed

1614
02:09:51,460 --> 02:09:53,819
and he wanted to go and lie down

1615
02:09:53,819 --> 02:10:02,359
in his bed in the bedroom.

1616
02:10:02,359 --> 02:10:07,250
Bowser at 152, 153 attack.

1617
02:10:07,250 --> 02:10:11,600
That was pretty good.

1618
02:10:11,600 --> 02:10:14,710
You probably could've heard that.

1619
02:10:14,710 --> 02:10:18,149
Usually I can get away with a full burp under my breath,

1620
02:10:18,149 --> 02:10:19,430
but everything was quiet

1621
02:10:19,430 --> 02:10:23,270
and you probably just heard that completely.

1622
02:10:23,270 --> 02:10:30,239
I need a, I'm sorry.

1623
02:10:30,239 --> 02:10:32,199
It was like cue the music to zero.

1624
02:10:33,569 --> 02:10:44,090
Hopefully nobody heard it.

1625
02:10:44,090 --> 02:11:07,170
Okay, backfire.

1626
02:11:11,380 --> 02:11:18,840
Out.

1627
02:11:18,840 --> 02:11:20,920
I want like another coffee.

1628
02:11:21,920 --> 02:11:23,880
I'm gonna have to feel like that.

1629
02:11:23,880 --> 02:11:26,000
Anybody have to feel like they want two coffees.

1630
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:33,890
Ultra flame, there it is.

1631
02:11:33,890 --> 02:11:35,090
I think today it might be a two,

1632
02:11:35,569 --> 02:11:37,609
it's like five, it's like six o'clock.

1633
02:11:40,939 --> 02:11:43,819
You can't drink coffee after six.

1634
02:11:43,819 --> 02:11:45,220
You can't, like that's bad.

1635
02:11:48,600 --> 02:11:49,640
That is too late.

1636
02:11:49,640 --> 02:11:50,840
I'll go get like a water.

1637
02:11:51,880 --> 02:11:52,720
Next break.

1638
02:11:57,979 --> 02:12:03,350
All right, if right flower click becomes more than 50%,

1639
02:12:03,550 --> 02:12:08,850
I'm gonna start just picking these.

1640
02:12:08,850 --> 02:12:09,930
Green tea.

1641
02:12:09,930 --> 02:12:10,770
You know what?

1642
02:12:10,770 --> 02:12:12,210
That's right, I could just get tea.

1643
02:12:12,210 --> 02:12:28,720
What do we have for tea here?

1644
02:12:28,720 --> 02:12:29,989
I wonder.

1645
02:12:30,670 --> 02:12:40,640
I think I have some green tea.

1646
02:12:40,640 --> 02:12:48,640
All right, well, I'm gonna start picking my own stuff then.

1647
02:12:48,640 --> 02:12:51,239
I mean, that's just too much.

1648
02:12:51,239 --> 02:12:54,399
Hey.

1649
02:12:54,399 --> 02:12:58,319
Hey there, I thought I heard footsteps.

1650
02:12:58,319 --> 02:13:01,060
For a minute I thought I was nuts.

1651
02:13:01,060 --> 02:13:03,539
Hey, that's killer.

1652
02:13:03,539 --> 02:13:05,380
I'm Hinopia.

1653
02:13:05,380 --> 02:13:07,460
This place is a regular inferno.

1654
02:13:07,460 --> 02:13:15,479
Come on, step inside.

1655
02:13:15,479 --> 02:13:30,180
Welcome to the item shop.

1656
02:13:30,180 --> 02:13:32,390
This here is the inn.

1657
02:13:32,390 --> 02:13:39,579
30 coins will get you a room.

1658
02:13:39,579 --> 02:13:41,880
Armor shop.

1659
02:13:41,880 --> 02:13:44,840
Ooh, fire shirt, fire pants, fire cape, fire shell,

1660
02:13:44,840 --> 02:13:49,319
fire dress, fire shirt, fire pants, fire cape,

1661
02:13:49,319 --> 02:14:00,359
fire dress, don't need the fire shell, fuzzy shirt,

1662
02:14:00,359 --> 02:14:11,590
fire shirt, fuzzy cape, fire cape, fuzzy dress,

1663
02:14:12,760 --> 02:14:21,560
fire dress, mega pants, fire pants, the lazy shell,

1664
02:14:25,789 --> 02:14:35,199
and the ghost map.

1665
02:14:35,199 --> 02:14:42,970
Cheater, not cheating yet, Bowser's not in the game.

1666
02:14:42,970 --> 02:14:44,489
30 coins, let's do it.

1667
02:14:46,210 --> 02:14:50,359
Hooray, I'll get everything ready for you.

1668
02:14:50,359 --> 02:14:56,529
This is a laugh out loud moment.

1669
02:14:56,529 --> 02:15:02,199
Morning, now wasn't that a cushy bed?

1670
02:15:02,199 --> 02:15:03,319
Thanks, guy.

1671
02:15:03,319 --> 02:15:04,560
Welcome to the item shop.

1672
02:15:07,199 --> 02:15:09,279
All I have is mid mushrooms, how many do I have?

1673
02:15:09,279 --> 02:15:15,170
Five, I'm gonna probably need,

1674
02:15:15,170 --> 02:15:18,079
I have so much junk in here.

1675
02:15:18,079 --> 02:15:22,479
Royal syrup is like a full pick me up eraser.

1676
02:15:22,479 --> 02:15:23,399
Probably use that soon.

1677
02:15:23,399 --> 02:15:25,960
Yoshi cookie, I haven't used it.

1678
02:15:25,960 --> 02:15:27,359
The bright card, what the hell am I,

1679
02:15:27,359 --> 02:15:28,439
I gotta get rid of these three.

1680
02:15:28,439 --> 02:15:30,439
I gotta go to the mushroom guy after this.

1681
02:15:34,689 --> 02:15:37,850
Pure water, yeah, I'll get rid of this.

1682
02:15:37,850 --> 02:15:41,140
I'm not gonna use it, that's why I care.

1683
02:15:41,140 --> 02:15:46,960
I got some Maxmo, I'm gonna get a couple mid mushrooms

1684
02:15:46,960 --> 02:15:48,840
just in case I don't use peach.

1685
02:15:50,069 --> 02:15:52,470
Mid mushroom, maple syrup, but that's all right.

1686
02:15:52,470 --> 02:15:57,189
Nah, that's fine, that's good, that's good, we're fine.

1687
02:15:57,189 --> 02:16:02,140
All right, we've got a pretty cool collection over here.

1688
02:16:02,140 --> 02:16:02,979
If you didn't know,

1689
02:16:02,979 --> 02:16:06,180
here's a little bit of a gamer trivia.

1690
02:16:06,180 --> 02:16:12,239
Here's the Star Fox, the Star Fox, the Arwing, cool.

1691
02:16:13,000 --> 02:16:16,140
Then you got F-Zero, pretty cool.

1692
02:16:16,140 --> 02:16:25,750
And I don't know what this is, I have no idea.

1693
02:16:25,750 --> 02:16:30,159
What's the one on the way to the right?

1694
02:16:30,159 --> 02:16:32,200
Metroid ship, I don't think I've ever seen

1695
02:16:32,200 --> 02:16:35,280
what the outside of the Metroid ship looks like.

1696
02:16:35,280 --> 02:16:38,440
I didn't really play that much Metroid, I really didn't.

1697
02:16:38,440 --> 02:16:40,799
I was a fan of some of it, but not all of it.

1698
02:16:40,799 --> 02:16:42,750
What?

1699
02:16:42,750 --> 02:16:43,989
I don't know, I just tried to pretend

1700
02:16:43,989 --> 02:16:45,590
I cared about that franchise, but I do,

1701
02:16:45,590 --> 02:16:48,389
but I don't, but I do, because it's a cool franchise.

1702
02:16:49,270 --> 02:17:03,280
All right, here we go, first try.

1703
02:17:03,280 --> 02:17:04,120
Uh-oh.

1704
02:17:12,270 --> 02:17:22,540
It's Yoshi, it's Fire Yoshi, the Tsar Dragon.

1705
02:17:22,540 --> 02:17:24,260
Why do I have two saves?

1706
02:17:24,260 --> 02:17:27,299
Because I freaked out.

1707
02:17:27,299 --> 02:17:28,700
I did play Metroid Prime,

1708
02:17:29,579 --> 02:17:37,670
but I couldn't play very much of it,

1709
02:17:37,670 --> 02:17:40,260
or else I didn't dodge that.

1710
02:17:40,260 --> 02:17:41,219
All right, here we go,

1711
02:17:41,219 --> 02:17:43,620
I'm gonna do Ultra Flame on the Flame Dragon,

1712
02:17:43,620 --> 02:17:44,700
that would be a stupid idea.

1713
02:17:44,700 --> 02:17:57,899
I'm going for it, 30 jumps right now.

1714
02:17:57,940 --> 02:17:58,780
I'm getting close.

1715
02:18:17,000 --> 02:18:23,409
Tsar means emperor in Russian.

1716
02:18:23,409 --> 02:18:32,790
Oh, 240 damage.

1717
02:18:32,790 --> 02:18:34,270
Holy shit, that's a lot.

1718
02:18:35,540 --> 02:18:36,940
I'm gonna get it.

1719
02:18:36,940 --> 02:18:38,139
Here we go, let's get it.

1720
02:18:39,879 --> 02:19:15,680
Oh, Fire-type having a Water-type move, stupid.

1721
02:19:15,680 --> 02:19:16,959
Damn it, it's so hard.

1722
02:19:16,959 --> 02:19:27,680
Fuck, you're never gonna get between 15 and 20.

1723
02:19:27,680 --> 02:19:33,040
It takes this hyper-Zen-like way to focus.

1724
02:19:39,079 --> 02:19:43,340
Imagine doing a hundred of those.

1725
02:19:43,340 --> 02:19:47,979
I didn't block that again.

1726
02:19:47,979 --> 02:19:50,239
All right, come on, please.

1727
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:07,000
I don't understand.

1728
02:20:07,000 --> 02:20:08,799
I'm doing it like the second it hits,

1729
02:20:08,799 --> 02:20:17,000
like, d-d-d-d-d-d, d-d-d-d-d-d-d, d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d.

1730
02:20:17,000 --> 02:20:18,280
What's the most I had?

1731
02:20:18,280 --> 02:20:30,459
20?

1732
02:20:30,459 --> 02:20:32,700
That was good, I just got that out of the way.

1733
02:20:32,700 --> 02:20:49,110
All right.

1734
02:20:49,110 --> 02:20:53,370
God damn it, I'm getting so mad about this.

1735
02:20:53,370 --> 02:20:54,649
It's so ridiculous.

1736
02:20:54,649 --> 02:20:55,489
Oh, fuck.

1737
02:20:56,670 --> 02:21:17,879
Fuck.

1738
02:21:17,879 --> 02:21:20,610
Okay, I'm gonna take my headphones out.

1739
02:21:20,610 --> 02:21:21,649
It can be super jump, too.

1740
02:21:21,649 --> 02:21:23,170
All right, headphones coming out.

1741
02:21:23,170 --> 02:21:24,770
I'm just doing it by sight only.

1742
02:21:29,069 --> 02:21:31,709
That didn't work, that was not good.

1743
02:21:31,709 --> 02:21:39,979
That didn't work.

1744
02:21:39,979 --> 02:21:52,040
It's all right, I don't care.

1745
02:21:52,040 --> 02:21:54,909
No, I just healed myself.

1746
02:22:13,360 --> 02:22:14,719
What the fuck?

1747
02:22:14,719 --> 02:22:16,000
I can't do it without the,

1748
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:19,120
I gotta put the headphones back in, shit, man.

1749
02:22:19,120 --> 02:22:20,440
That's so hard.

1750
02:22:49,709 --> 02:23:09,760
It's 15 every fucking time.

1751
02:23:09,760 --> 02:23:12,670
One thing I've never achieved in this game is that

1752
02:23:12,670 --> 02:23:24,860
I've never been able to do it.

1753
02:23:24,860 --> 02:23:26,700
I'm gonna jump, I'm gonna like jump with the motherfucker,

1754
02:23:26,700 --> 02:23:43,299
I swear to God.

1755
02:23:43,299 --> 02:23:47,139
Get fit with Mario.

1756
02:23:47,139 --> 02:23:47,979
Here we go.

1757
02:23:47,979 --> 02:23:49,139
No, I can't even do it.

1758
02:23:49,139 --> 02:23:50,340
I used all my points.

1759
02:23:51,520 --> 02:23:52,920
Desperately trying to achieve it.

1760
02:23:52,920 --> 02:24:13,680
374, that's insane.

1761
02:24:13,680 --> 02:24:14,959
I did it.

1762
02:24:14,959 --> 02:24:19,090
Got the star.

1763
02:24:19,090 --> 02:24:19,969
Getting close.

1764
02:24:19,969 --> 02:24:30,360
Only one more to go.

1765
02:24:30,360 --> 02:24:32,079
I'll be taking that, thank you.

1766
02:24:33,479 --> 02:24:42,149
Huh?

1767
02:24:42,149 --> 02:24:45,620
We got the star.

1768
02:24:45,620 --> 02:24:49,889
Now we're amazing.

1769
02:24:49,889 --> 02:24:53,520
We're unbeatable.

1770
02:24:53,520 --> 02:24:56,920
We're gorgeous.

1771
02:24:56,920 --> 02:24:58,639
You better leave now, chumps.

1772
02:25:05,530 --> 02:25:12,530
Get back here.

1773
02:25:12,530 --> 02:25:14,649
Hey, Red, look down there.

1774
02:25:14,649 --> 02:25:18,430
That's gonna be the ugliest mustache I've ever seen.

1775
02:25:18,430 --> 02:25:20,920
Ew, gross.

1776
02:25:20,920 --> 02:25:24,860
That guy's worse looking than that Claude Mario.

1777
02:25:24,860 --> 02:25:27,860
That is Mario, you idiot.

1778
02:25:27,860 --> 02:25:28,899
Listen, everyone.

1779
02:25:28,899 --> 02:25:31,819
We gotta get this star to the blade immediately.

1780
02:25:31,860 --> 02:25:41,409
We'll deal with Mario later.

1781
02:25:41,409 --> 02:25:43,250
Hey, Red, careful with this.

1782
02:25:43,250 --> 02:26:15,979
You're all thumbs.

1783
02:26:15,979 --> 02:26:18,079
Where's the blade?

1784
02:26:18,079 --> 02:26:19,879
He'll be here.

1785
02:26:19,879 --> 02:26:21,520
Are you sure?

1786
02:26:21,520 --> 02:26:23,799
Relax, people.

1787
02:26:23,799 --> 02:26:26,020
Mario's here.

1788
02:26:26,020 --> 02:26:27,459
He's too late.

1789
02:26:27,459 --> 02:26:29,739
Now where's the blade?

1790
02:26:29,739 --> 02:26:32,920
Shut up already.

1791
02:26:32,920 --> 02:26:34,719
Wrong voice.

1792
02:26:34,719 --> 02:26:41,440
Finally.

1793
02:26:41,440 --> 02:26:44,229
We fight for evil.

1794
02:26:44,229 --> 02:26:46,469
We live for disorder.

1795
02:26:46,469 --> 02:26:49,100
We like what we do.

1796
02:26:49,100 --> 02:26:52,239
We struggle for chaos.

1797
02:26:52,239 --> 02:26:53,159
We are.

1798
02:27:02,549 --> 02:27:05,270
This star piece gives people hope.

1799
02:27:05,270 --> 02:27:09,409
It needs to be destroyed.

1800
02:27:09,409 --> 02:27:12,719
That was all five of them talking at the same time.

1801
02:27:12,719 --> 02:27:13,959
Oh, well, that's funny.

1802
02:27:13,959 --> 02:27:30,129
Geno Blast.

1803
02:27:30,129 --> 02:27:31,920
All right, who we going for?

1804
02:27:31,920 --> 02:27:42,760
Let's go for Green.

1805
02:27:42,760 --> 02:27:49,809
Oh, Geno's dead.

1806
02:27:49,809 --> 02:27:51,329
Oh shit, a healer.

1807
02:27:51,329 --> 02:27:52,170
A healer.

1808
02:28:04,389 --> 02:28:14,239
Boom.

1809
02:28:14,239 --> 02:28:16,000
I'm back.

1810
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:17,959
My pick me ups are specifically for Peach.

1811
02:28:30,690 --> 02:28:32,690
He's dead.

1812
02:28:32,690 --> 02:28:33,450
He's going to hit him again.

1813
02:28:33,450 --> 02:28:35,399
Don't do it.

1814
02:28:35,399 --> 02:28:42,040
All right, I need a group hug.

1815
02:28:42,040 --> 02:28:45,370
He's dead again.

1816
02:28:45,370 --> 02:28:46,649
Bad.

1817
02:28:46,649 --> 02:28:47,610
Bad.

1818
02:28:47,610 --> 02:28:48,209
Very bad.

1819
02:28:48,209 --> 02:28:48,809
Very bad.

1820
02:28:48,809 --> 02:28:49,569
We're just going to pick me up.

1821
02:28:49,569 --> 02:28:51,010
I have to.

1822
02:28:51,010 --> 02:28:59,899
I'm going to Geno Blast again.

1823
02:28:59,899 --> 02:29:01,540
That would have probably killed him.

1824
02:29:01,540 --> 02:29:02,459
All right, let's go.

1825
02:29:02,459 --> 02:29:03,579
Geno Flash.

1826
02:29:03,579 --> 02:29:10,520
Let's fucking just burn them all up.

1827
02:29:10,520 --> 02:29:21,579
Let's take out like two or three.

1828
02:29:21,579 --> 02:29:22,100
Sleeping?

1829
02:29:22,100 --> 02:29:23,780
It's all right, group hug.

1830
02:29:23,780 --> 02:29:25,299
Yo, Red.

1831
02:29:25,299 --> 02:29:26,909
What?

1832
02:29:26,909 --> 02:29:29,149
I broke my shades.

1833
02:29:29,149 --> 02:29:31,530
Served you right.

1834
02:29:31,530 --> 02:29:33,170
Hey, Red.

1835
02:29:33,170 --> 02:29:34,129
What?

1836
02:29:34,129 --> 02:29:38,260
I've got a headache.

1837
02:29:38,260 --> 02:29:51,059
You're totally out of shape.

1838
02:29:51,059 --> 02:29:51,739
Bad leader.

1839
02:29:51,739 --> 02:29:56,319
This insults his team.

1840
02:29:56,319 --> 02:29:59,940
This is not good.

1841
02:29:59,940 --> 02:30:00,940
It's OK.

1842
02:30:00,940 --> 02:30:02,899
Do I have any able juices?

1843
02:30:04,489 --> 02:30:05,809
Hey, Lucky Jewel.

1844
02:30:05,809 --> 02:30:06,569
No, no, no, no.

1845
02:30:06,569 --> 02:30:17,940
Not until I'm almost done.

1846
02:30:17,940 --> 02:30:19,180
We can take out a pink.

1847
02:30:19,180 --> 02:30:21,610
Just one punch to knock it out.

1848
02:30:21,610 --> 02:30:25,200
Because I'm not sure what to do.

1849
02:30:25,200 --> 02:30:26,520
Red.

1850
02:30:26,520 --> 02:30:28,059
What?

1851
02:30:28,059 --> 02:30:30,420
My makeup's running.

1852
02:30:30,420 --> 02:30:44,239
Then change brands.

1853
02:30:44,239 --> 02:30:44,959
Ultra Flame.

1854
02:30:44,959 --> 02:31:02,129
Let's do it on a yellow shit brand.

1855
02:31:02,129 --> 02:31:03,450
All right, get out of there, Peach.

1856
02:31:03,450 --> 02:31:04,969
Come on.

1857
02:31:04,969 --> 02:31:06,930
Mario can't do this on his own.

1858
02:31:06,930 --> 02:31:08,569
In fact, Mario can't do this on his own.

1859
02:31:08,569 --> 02:31:12,770
So Mario's going to do a mid mushroom.

1860
02:31:32,760 --> 02:31:36,079
Body slam.

1861
02:31:36,079 --> 02:31:37,479
Now he's done.

1862
02:31:37,479 --> 02:31:41,319
Peach, please.

1863
02:31:41,319 --> 02:31:42,760
Peach, recover.

1864
02:31:42,760 --> 02:31:44,159
Thank you.

1865
02:31:44,159 --> 02:31:45,639
Come on back.

1866
02:31:59,899 --> 02:32:06,860
The timing on that plant hit there.

1867
02:32:06,860 --> 02:32:08,680
Should be it for you.

1868
02:32:08,680 --> 02:32:10,559
Hey, yo, Red.

1869
02:32:10,559 --> 02:32:11,879
What?

1870
02:32:11,879 --> 02:32:14,319
I'm hungry.

1871
02:32:14,319 --> 02:32:16,450
Chew on your tongue.

1872
02:32:16,450 --> 02:32:31,870
All right, you guys really are in like shambles as a group.

1873
02:32:31,870 --> 02:32:42,950
No, zero, good.

1874
02:32:42,950 --> 02:32:46,760
And enough.

1875
02:32:46,760 --> 02:32:48,920
Now I'm angry.

1876
02:32:48,920 --> 02:32:51,000
It's time to finish this.

1877
02:32:51,000 --> 02:32:54,809
Formation, halt.

1878
02:32:54,809 --> 02:33:00,440
Here we go.

1879
02:33:00,440 --> 02:33:18,860
After a transformer here.

1880
02:33:18,860 --> 02:33:21,180
God, I fucking psyched myself up.

1881
02:33:21,180 --> 02:33:22,940
Force beam energized.

1882
02:33:22,940 --> 02:33:24,899
Maximum charge.

1883
02:33:24,899 --> 02:33:27,579
Now fire the breaker.

1884
02:33:27,579 --> 02:33:33,979
Breaker beam.

1885
02:33:33,979 --> 02:33:36,459
I feel like, I think I'm going to miss this step.

1886
02:33:36,459 --> 02:33:38,920
I almost won.

1887
02:33:38,920 --> 02:33:39,399
I almost won.

1888
02:33:39,399 --> 02:33:41,360
He kills everybody.

1889
02:33:41,360 --> 02:33:51,610
We got Rupok coming up.

1890
02:33:51,610 --> 02:34:24,600
Did I do it?

1891
02:34:24,600 --> 02:34:25,159
How many was that?

1892
02:34:25,159 --> 02:34:25,719
How many was that?

1893
02:34:25,719 --> 02:34:26,239
How many was that?

1894
02:34:26,239 --> 02:34:26,719
How many?

1895
02:34:26,719 --> 02:34:28,540
Is that what?

1896
02:34:28,540 --> 02:34:29,020
Did I do it?

1897
02:34:29,020 --> 02:34:31,479
Is that 30?

1898
02:34:31,479 --> 02:34:32,920
Did I do it?

1899
02:34:32,920 --> 02:34:35,120
I did it.

1900
02:34:35,120 --> 02:34:36,559
I did it.

1901
02:34:36,559 --> 02:34:37,280
I did it.

1902
02:34:37,280 --> 02:34:39,799
36?

1903
02:34:39,879 --> 02:34:41,920
Oh, shit.

1904
02:34:41,920 --> 02:34:42,879
All right.

1905
02:34:42,879 --> 02:34:44,860
Nice.

1906
02:34:44,860 --> 02:34:47,100
Wow.

1907
02:34:47,100 --> 02:34:52,819
I did it.

1908
02:34:52,819 --> 02:34:54,299
Now get 100.

1909
02:34:54,299 --> 02:34:56,760
That's the next step.

1910
02:34:56,760 --> 02:35:08,639
You have to just like zone out.

1911
02:35:08,639 --> 02:35:12,450
Are we at full health?

1912
02:35:12,450 --> 02:35:13,170
I don't know.

1913
02:35:13,170 --> 02:35:14,530
This might kill everybody.

1914
02:35:14,530 --> 02:35:23,239
Did everybody heal?

1915
02:35:23,239 --> 02:35:35,500
All right, that was pretty bad.

1916
02:35:35,500 --> 02:35:40,719
Peach may be the best character in the game.

1917
02:35:40,719 --> 02:35:42,200
Recharging.

1918
02:35:42,200 --> 02:35:44,239
I wonder, let me just do like a genoflash or something.

1919
02:35:44,239 --> 02:35:46,000
No, that's probably not going to do much.

1920
02:35:46,000 --> 02:35:48,879
Let's keep doing basic attacks.

1921
02:35:48,879 --> 02:35:51,780
145 damage each time.

1922
02:35:51,780 --> 02:35:53,059
That says really good.

1923
02:35:53,059 --> 02:36:01,280
Everyone's at full health.

1924
02:36:01,280 --> 02:36:02,520
There it is.

1925
02:36:02,520 --> 02:36:04,799
This isn't possible.

1926
02:36:04,799 --> 02:36:10,709
We are invincible.

1927
02:36:10,709 --> 02:36:16,389
Can this be happening to the Axum Rangers?

1928
02:36:16,389 --> 02:36:21,760
What?

1929
02:36:21,760 --> 02:36:42,000
17 experience.

1930
02:36:42,000 --> 02:36:45,090
Hang in there, Axum Rangers.

1931
02:36:45,090 --> 02:36:54,440
Why are you on the backup?

1932
02:36:54,440 --> 02:36:57,520
And then those seven combine into one.

1933
02:36:57,520 --> 02:37:01,940
And then you need to do that six more times.

1934
02:37:01,940 --> 02:37:04,540
Six star pieces have finally been collected.

1935
02:37:04,540 --> 02:37:06,059
Where could that last star piece be?

1936
02:37:20,629 --> 02:37:21,790
All right.

1937
02:37:21,790 --> 02:37:29,069
Now we can do a couple of things.

1938
02:37:29,069 --> 02:37:31,229
There's one or two things I need to clean up first

1939
02:37:31,270 --> 02:37:47,319
before we continue on to the end game.

1940
02:37:47,319 --> 02:37:52,239
All I need to go to, where's the mushroom guy?

1941
02:37:52,239 --> 02:37:56,260
Which town was mushroom guy in?

1942
02:37:56,260 --> 02:37:58,100
Moleville?

1943
02:37:58,100 --> 02:37:59,579
Merrymore?

1944
02:37:59,579 --> 02:38:00,020
I don't remember.

1945
02:38:00,020 --> 02:38:01,180
Seaside town?

1946
02:38:01,180 --> 02:38:05,840
I think it's seaside town.

1947
02:38:05,840 --> 02:38:07,840
Am I going to get the lazy shell?

1948
02:38:07,840 --> 02:38:18,389
I think it was over here, because it was the other side this way.

1949
02:38:18,389 --> 02:38:20,959
Mushroom boy.

1950
02:38:20,959 --> 02:38:21,719
You have any mushrooms?

1951
02:38:21,719 --> 02:38:23,000
I do.

1952
02:38:23,000 --> 02:38:27,819
Hey, you don't have any mushrooms.

1953
02:38:27,819 --> 02:38:36,670
What the fuck are you talking about?

1954
02:38:36,670 --> 02:38:47,389
Is this the guy?

1955
02:38:47,430 --> 02:38:48,229
I could have.

1956
02:38:48,229 --> 02:38:51,450
OK.

1957
02:38:51,450 --> 02:38:52,969
I guess I don't have mushrooms.

1958
02:38:52,969 --> 02:38:57,549
I thought.

1959
02:38:57,549 --> 02:39:01,280
Let's see if we can make you look a little more snazzy.

1960
02:39:01,280 --> 02:39:05,409
No, let's not.

1961
02:39:05,409 --> 02:39:07,090
So I'm just going to get rid of these then.

1962
02:39:07,090 --> 02:39:12,690
I thought you could be sitting here.

1963
02:39:12,690 --> 02:39:21,030
I know I can do something in Moleville.

1964
02:39:21,030 --> 02:39:25,149
I'm right.

1965
02:39:25,149 --> 02:39:26,989
I think I can, there's my egg, right?

1966
02:39:26,989 --> 02:39:30,229
The mystery egg now I can give to this guy.

1967
02:39:30,229 --> 02:39:32,709
I can sell something to him.

1968
02:39:32,709 --> 02:39:33,510
Good to see you again.

1969
02:39:33,510 --> 02:39:35,469
I'll show you my inventory.

1970
02:39:35,469 --> 02:39:37,149
A metal plate.

1971
02:39:37,149 --> 02:39:40,590
Don't know what it's used for, but I'll sell it for 300 coins.

1972
02:39:40,590 --> 02:39:42,069
I'll take it.

1973
02:39:42,069 --> 02:39:44,040
Nice doing business with you.

1974
02:39:44,040 --> 02:39:49,489
That's all I got.

1975
02:39:49,489 --> 02:39:54,729
I think that is, there it is.

1976
02:39:54,729 --> 02:39:57,579
The frying pan.

1977
02:39:57,579 --> 02:40:07,000
There's Peach's best weapon, I believe.

1978
02:40:07,000 --> 02:40:08,719
PUBG frying pan.

1979
02:40:08,719 --> 02:40:18,709
I think that's all I can do here.

1980
02:40:18,709 --> 02:40:22,280
This guy doesn't have anything else.

1981
02:40:22,280 --> 02:40:25,780
I have no inventory.

1982
02:40:25,819 --> 02:40:27,139
Am I going to fight the Final Fantasy boss?

1983
02:40:27,139 --> 02:40:29,959
Yes.

1984
02:40:29,959 --> 02:40:32,840
The carbo, I remember this is incredibly convoluted.

1985
02:40:32,840 --> 02:40:34,399
The carbo cookie.

1986
02:40:34,399 --> 02:40:37,120
You actually can get a carbo cookie.

1987
02:40:37,120 --> 02:40:40,120
You go through this really annoying process to get a carbo cookie.

1988
02:40:40,120 --> 02:40:42,600
It's like trading a bunch of shit and getting rid of money.

1989
02:40:42,600 --> 02:40:48,610
You give it to this little kid and nothing interesting happens.

1990
02:40:48,610 --> 02:40:53,299
You actually can just, I mean, spoiler alert.

1991
02:40:53,299 --> 02:40:57,190
She gets off the bucket and then you can go in the bucket.

1992
02:40:57,190 --> 02:41:02,270
And I think it just takes her to the river.

1993
02:41:02,270 --> 02:41:05,110
I forget how to even do the carbo cookie.

1994
02:41:05,110 --> 02:41:06,270
Would you like a shiny stone?

1995
02:41:06,270 --> 02:41:12,250
No.

1996
02:41:12,250 --> 02:41:15,610
It means you helped her.

1997
02:41:15,610 --> 02:41:16,690
Figure it out.

1998
02:41:16,690 --> 02:41:19,760
Figure it out.

1999
02:41:19,760 --> 02:41:20,680
Hold on.

2000
02:41:20,680 --> 02:41:28,059
I've got to keep the game progression going.

2001
02:41:28,059 --> 02:41:30,180
If you help her, it sets up fireworks.

2002
02:41:30,180 --> 02:41:31,139
Oh yeah, the end credits.

2003
02:41:31,139 --> 02:41:34,319
If you do the five secrets right.

2004
02:41:34,319 --> 02:41:35,399
All right, let's go up here.

2005
02:41:35,399 --> 02:41:38,020
Let's do this.

2006
02:41:38,020 --> 02:41:41,530
You're an idiot.

2007
02:41:41,530 --> 02:41:42,729
All right, let's sell some stuff.

2008
02:41:42,729 --> 02:41:50,200
Let's restock and get on with it, right?

2009
02:41:50,200 --> 02:41:52,319
Imagine I sold that.

2010
02:41:52,319 --> 02:41:55,239
That's the thing about these old games on old consoles.

2011
02:41:55,239 --> 02:41:57,920
If I would have accidentally just pressed A,

2012
02:41:57,920 --> 02:42:01,670
I would have to reload and save.

2013
02:42:01,670 --> 02:42:02,309
Mega pants.

2014
02:42:02,309 --> 02:42:03,110
Get rid of these.

2015
02:42:03,110 --> 02:42:04,670
Keep the work pants in case I want to.

2016
02:42:04,670 --> 02:42:07,350
Buzzy, buzzy, buzzy.

2017
02:42:07,350 --> 02:42:12,760
Where else these can stay?

2018
02:42:12,760 --> 02:42:13,639
Mid-mushroom.

2019
02:42:13,639 --> 02:42:15,440
Breathe, breathe.

2020
02:42:15,440 --> 02:42:20,229
I'll get another maple syrups.

2021
02:42:20,229 --> 02:42:28,149
I want at least two pick me ups because you've got to be careful.

2022
02:42:28,149 --> 02:42:29,270
Give Peach the lazy shell.

2023
02:42:29,270 --> 02:42:36,229
I'm begging you.

2024
02:42:36,229 --> 02:42:41,989
How about sell the damn lazy shell if you don't have patience with me?

2025
02:42:41,989 --> 02:42:45,920
30 jumps, all right.

2026
02:42:45,920 --> 02:42:57,350
I've got to go back to Montreux Town.

2027
02:42:57,350 --> 02:42:59,280
You won't do it.

2028
02:42:59,280 --> 02:43:01,799
No, I won't because that's the crutch.

2029
02:43:01,799 --> 02:43:09,909
If I can't beat Kulex, I just can't seem to find the casino.

2030
02:43:09,909 --> 02:43:11,229
I'm so tired.

2031
02:43:11,229 --> 02:43:13,709
I've been walking around all day.

2032
02:43:13,709 --> 02:43:16,590
Hey, he's holding a leaflet.

2033
02:43:16,590 --> 02:43:20,079
Do you want to read it?

2034
02:43:20,079 --> 02:43:21,360
Come to Great Guy Casino.

2035
02:43:21,360 --> 02:43:23,319
Three jumps and a bright card will get you in.

2036
02:43:23,319 --> 02:43:27,569
Sorry, but no chomps allowed.

2037
02:43:27,569 --> 02:43:29,290
Three jumps, a bright card, and no chomps.

2038
02:43:29,290 --> 02:43:30,450
What is this?

2039
02:43:30,450 --> 02:43:31,250
I already know that.

2040
02:43:31,250 --> 02:43:34,600
I already know that.

2041
02:43:34,600 --> 02:43:35,440
Thanks, Colbert.

2042
02:43:42,489 --> 02:43:44,989
Guys, Colbert, bullshit.

2043
02:43:53,120 --> 02:44:07,879
Let's go back to Montreux Town and get our item for doing 30 jumps.

2044
02:44:07,879 --> 02:44:14,079
And then we have to do 100.

2045
02:44:14,079 --> 02:44:16,450
No, I don't want to go in there.

2046
02:44:16,450 --> 02:44:17,809
I don't want to go in there.

2047
02:44:17,809 --> 02:44:20,829
Don't go in there.

2048
02:44:20,829 --> 02:44:23,989
I heard your record for jumping stands at 35 right now.

2049
02:44:23,989 --> 02:44:24,670
Wow, you did it.

2050
02:44:24,670 --> 02:44:26,110
You made it over 30 jumps.

2051
02:44:26,110 --> 02:44:33,120
Here's your prize, a tack scarf.

2052
02:44:33,120 --> 02:44:36,000
This thing is insane, by the way.

2053
02:44:36,000 --> 02:44:42,049
Look at this thing.

2054
02:44:42,049 --> 02:44:46,149
So comfy, it'll make you jump.

2055
02:44:46,149 --> 02:45:00,719
Now, feather or, do you know, I like speed on G.

2056
02:45:00,719 --> 02:45:07,360
Actually, speed on Peach is better because you can just do more stuff.

2057
02:45:07,360 --> 02:45:12,569
Now, the real impossible destructive play here

2058
02:45:12,569 --> 02:45:21,520
is a tack scarf, lazy shell.

2059
02:45:21,520 --> 02:45:25,399
Where's the lazy shell?

2060
02:45:25,399 --> 02:45:27,479
I sold it.

2061
02:45:27,479 --> 02:45:29,680
I sold it, and I saved the game.

2062
02:45:29,680 --> 02:45:38,010
Oh, my god.

2063
02:45:38,010 --> 02:45:41,100
What do you got for a ghost medal?

2064
02:45:41,100 --> 02:45:43,700
Maybe I should give the ghost medal to Gino.

2065
02:45:43,700 --> 02:45:45,579
Because the ammo is kind of old at this point.

2066
02:45:45,579 --> 02:45:49,979
Let's give.

2067
02:45:49,979 --> 02:45:51,940
Yeah, let's do it.

2068
02:45:51,940 --> 02:45:54,139
Hey, thank you, JermaSucks, for the five community subs.

2069
02:45:54,139 --> 02:45:59,860
Appreciate that.

2070
02:45:59,860 --> 02:46:04,000
Thanks, and five subs.

2071
02:46:04,000 --> 02:46:05,639
Ooh, you know what I can do, though?

2072
02:46:05,639 --> 02:46:07,819
Here's what I can do.

2073
02:46:07,819 --> 02:46:11,510
It's sensei time.

2074
02:46:11,510 --> 02:46:12,950
I think I might be OK.

2075
02:46:12,950 --> 02:46:20,090
This might be worth trying again.

2076
02:46:20,090 --> 02:46:28,930
Because I've leveled up like four or five times.

2077
02:46:28,930 --> 02:46:31,209
You also get another insane item.

2078
02:46:31,209 --> 02:46:31,770
Let's try this again.

2079
02:46:31,770 --> 02:46:32,409
You wish to challenge me?

2080
02:46:32,409 --> 02:46:35,719
Yes.

2081
02:46:35,719 --> 02:46:42,200
Let's see if I can do it.

2082
02:46:42,200 --> 02:46:43,239
106, good.

2083
02:46:43,239 --> 02:46:48,879
That's a good start.

2084
02:46:48,879 --> 02:46:53,420
Frying pan.

2085
02:46:53,420 --> 02:46:56,600
Zero, that's good.

2086
02:46:56,600 --> 02:46:57,479
Oh, fuck.

2087
02:46:57,479 --> 02:46:59,280
All right, it didn't instantly kill him.

2088
02:46:59,280 --> 02:47:00,399
That's good.

2089
02:47:00,399 --> 02:47:06,020
That's certainly not a bad thing.

2090
02:47:06,020 --> 02:47:12,110
I have enough to take one hit.

2091
02:47:12,110 --> 02:47:19,350
Mario's going to be the one doing all the damage.

2092
02:47:19,350 --> 02:47:20,750
I missed it.

2093
02:47:20,750 --> 02:47:21,670
Sorry.

2094
02:47:21,670 --> 02:47:24,760
Triple kick.

2095
02:47:24,760 --> 02:47:25,600
Zero, good.

2096
02:47:25,600 --> 02:47:26,719
Perfect blocks.

2097
02:47:26,719 --> 02:47:30,319
Perfect.

2098
02:47:30,319 --> 02:47:33,680
Let's see how much damage she does.

2099
02:47:33,680 --> 02:47:34,639
That's not good at all.

2100
02:47:34,639 --> 02:47:36,920
All right, we're going to have to play supportive roles here.

2101
02:47:36,920 --> 02:47:38,520
And we're going for 100 jumps right now.

2102
02:47:38,520 --> 02:47:42,450
I'm going to get it right now, guaranteed.

2103
02:47:42,450 --> 02:47:45,909
I was just talking, and that's why I bumped it up.

2104
02:47:45,909 --> 02:47:47,069
We just gave a lot of subs.

2105
02:47:47,069 --> 02:47:54,360
Hold on.

2106
02:47:54,360 --> 02:47:56,000
Nocturne.

2107
02:47:56,000 --> 02:48:01,280
Thank you, Nocturne, Aceturne, for the 20 community subs.

2108
02:48:01,280 --> 02:48:06,959
Thank you.

2109
02:48:06,959 --> 02:48:09,850
That's a huge sub drop.

2110
02:48:09,850 --> 02:48:13,729
Thanks a lot.

2111
02:48:13,729 --> 02:48:19,340
Congratulations to all of you that got one.

2112
02:48:19,340 --> 02:48:20,739
Really appreciate that, though.

2113
02:48:20,739 --> 02:48:22,659
That's a shit load of subs.

2114
02:48:22,659 --> 02:48:24,979
A lot of people are fucking subbing.

2115
02:48:24,979 --> 02:48:26,020
Even just like tier one.

2116
02:48:26,020 --> 02:48:28,219
I know we make the jokes about the whole September thing,

2117
02:48:28,219 --> 02:48:30,459
but there's a lot of people that sub today already.

2118
02:48:30,459 --> 02:48:32,100
Just straight up.

2119
02:48:32,100 --> 02:48:33,620
So thank you, guys.

2120
02:48:33,620 --> 02:48:53,819
Guaranteed here it is fucking knocking the fuck around.

2121
02:48:53,819 --> 02:49:01,510
Damn it, I fucking had it.

2122
02:49:01,510 --> 02:49:02,069
You know what I have to do?

2123
02:49:02,069 --> 02:49:05,260
I have to lean back in my fucking chair.

2124
02:49:05,260 --> 02:49:20,959
I got to lean back in my chair and just stare at the wall.

2125
02:49:20,959 --> 02:49:22,440
I'm going to try it each time.

2126
02:49:22,440 --> 02:49:23,200
Let's see if I can get close.

2127
02:49:23,200 --> 02:49:24,360
If I can do over 50.

2128
02:49:24,360 --> 02:49:28,190
No, there's no way I'm going to do 100.

2129
02:49:28,190 --> 02:49:41,000
I'm leaning fucking back.

2130
02:49:41,000 --> 02:49:48,090
Nope, not in the zen mode.

2131
02:49:48,090 --> 02:49:51,079
That one frame, I got to catch it.

2132
02:49:51,079 --> 02:49:53,600
How did I do 30 fucking 5?

2133
02:49:53,600 --> 02:50:17,090
It's very hard.

2134
02:50:17,090 --> 02:50:20,159
Yeah, it is.

2135
02:50:20,159 --> 02:50:22,040
240.

2136
02:50:22,040 --> 02:50:23,799
Uh-oh, good thing I had those pick-me-ups,

2137
02:50:23,799 --> 02:50:33,569
because that's why I wanted them.

2138
02:50:33,569 --> 02:50:36,110
Just get rid of it.

2139
02:50:36,110 --> 02:50:38,870
I'm not going to waste the materials.

2140
02:50:38,870 --> 02:50:39,870
Simply amazing.

2141
02:50:46,149 --> 02:50:49,090
You are stronger, champion.

2142
02:50:49,090 --> 02:50:50,809
No doubt about it.

2143
02:50:50,809 --> 02:50:54,049
My reputation was staked on this last fight.

2144
02:50:54,049 --> 02:50:57,329
So I've lost the title of Sensei.

2145
02:50:57,329 --> 02:51:01,850
From today, you are the Sensei of this dojo.

2146
02:51:01,850 --> 02:51:04,569
Please take this belt, which only the highest ranking

2147
02:51:04,569 --> 02:51:09,559
fighter in the dojo can wear.

2148
02:51:09,559 --> 02:51:10,319
Good.

2149
02:51:10,319 --> 02:51:10,879
Good for you.

2150
02:51:10,879 --> 02:51:11,319
You did it.

2151
02:51:11,319 --> 02:51:12,120
You got a jinx belt.

2152
02:51:12,120 --> 02:51:13,959
Nice job.

2153
02:51:13,959 --> 02:51:18,129
We will rename the dojo Mario Style Dojo

2154
02:51:18,129 --> 02:51:28,920
and incorporate your jump technique into the training.

2155
02:51:28,920 --> 02:51:33,139
Jacker and I will start our training immediately.

2156
02:51:33,139 --> 02:51:34,899
1,000 warm-up jumps.

2157
02:51:34,899 --> 02:51:35,899
Ready?

2158
02:51:35,899 --> 02:51:36,899
Peek-in!

2159
02:51:36,899 --> 02:51:43,950
Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.

2160
02:51:43,950 --> 02:51:46,809
That's so cute.

2161
02:51:46,809 --> 02:51:50,049
All right, so now we have the jinx belt,

2162
02:51:50,049 --> 02:51:58,370
which is a huge amount of attack and defense.

2163
02:51:58,370 --> 02:52:00,770
Probably better than both of these.

2164
02:52:00,770 --> 02:52:10,610
I wonder if the feather is better than the true feather.

2165
02:52:10,610 --> 02:52:13,809
Give her the shell.

2166
02:52:13,809 --> 02:52:17,680
No.

2167
02:52:17,680 --> 02:52:28,030
No.

2168
02:52:28,030 --> 02:52:29,309
Give it to her right now.

2169
02:52:29,309 --> 02:52:29,870
I'm not.

2170
02:52:29,870 --> 02:52:30,510
Just wait.

2171
02:52:30,510 --> 02:52:32,909
We don't need it yet.

2172
02:52:32,909 --> 02:52:34,229
You want me to break the game?

2173
02:52:34,229 --> 02:52:36,350
I'll break the game eventually, but we're

2174
02:52:36,350 --> 02:52:46,569
doing a blind playthrough supported by 500 attempts

2175
02:52:46,569 --> 02:52:49,530
where I was a 500 times.

2176
02:52:49,530 --> 02:52:51,129
All right, let's get out of here.

2177
02:52:51,129 --> 02:52:52,729
I got my jinx belt.

2178
02:52:52,729 --> 02:52:54,329
Cleaned up the stuff in the dojo here.

2179
02:52:54,329 --> 02:52:57,409
Got the attack scarf, so I am good to go.

2180
02:52:57,409 --> 02:52:57,909
OK.

2181
02:53:01,729 --> 02:53:15,860
It's time to go to the final arc of the video game.

2182
02:53:15,860 --> 02:53:20,649
I'm encroaching on the final probably hour or two.

2183
02:53:20,649 --> 02:53:27,870
Depends on how badly I get destroyed by cure.

2184
02:53:27,870 --> 02:53:32,000
That's such an ENFP thing to say.

2185
02:53:32,000 --> 02:53:36,319
I have no idea what the flying buck you're talking about.

2186
02:53:36,319 --> 02:53:52,559
But all right, let's go talk to the king.

2187
02:53:52,559 --> 02:53:55,200
ENFP pants.

2188
02:53:55,200 --> 02:54:05,540
ENFP pants moment.

2189
02:54:05,540 --> 02:54:08,540
And we did it.

2190
02:54:08,540 --> 02:54:10,770
What was this voice again?

2191
02:54:10,770 --> 02:54:16,149
Mom, Dad, were you able to find the star, dear?

2192
02:54:16,149 --> 02:54:19,030
Yeah, the Axe and Rangers took it away from us,

2193
02:54:19,030 --> 02:54:21,030
but we got it back again.

2194
02:54:21,030 --> 02:54:22,750
Well, that was much wonderful.

2195
02:54:22,750 --> 02:54:28,200
Now the star, oh, starting, can be repaired, right?

2196
02:54:28,200 --> 02:54:29,399
I guess not, you.

2197
02:54:29,399 --> 02:54:33,010
Still missing a piece, I think.

2198
02:54:33,010 --> 02:54:34,409
The last star?

2199
02:54:34,409 --> 02:54:39,569
Wait, the only place left to look is in Bowser's Keep.

2200
02:54:39,569 --> 02:54:41,770
Yeah, we know, but there's no way to get in.

2201
02:54:41,770 --> 02:54:45,170
Believe me, we tried.

2202
02:54:45,170 --> 02:54:49,610
Yes, yes, even Mario can't jump that far.

2203
02:54:49,610 --> 02:54:53,629
All right, I'll let you use.

2204
02:54:53,629 --> 02:54:56,110
That's it, dear.

2205
02:54:56,110 --> 02:55:00,559
You should use the royal bus.

2206
02:55:00,559 --> 02:55:07,030
Yes, well, the time has come for you two to make the bus.

2207
02:55:07,030 --> 02:55:10,510
Why, when I was your age.

2208
02:55:10,510 --> 02:55:13,950
Really, are you sure it's all right?

2209
02:55:13,950 --> 02:55:16,069
Of course, dear, I've ordered the repairman

2210
02:55:16,069 --> 02:55:19,829
to have it fixed by the time you leave.

2211
02:55:19,829 --> 02:55:21,709
You simply have to help Mario and the others

2212
02:55:21,709 --> 02:55:24,559
get that last star.

2213
02:55:24,559 --> 02:55:26,040
You bet, mom.

2214
02:55:26,040 --> 02:55:30,899
Come on, Mario, let's go.

2215
02:55:30,899 --> 02:55:37,719
500 male voices, one female voice.

2216
02:55:37,719 --> 02:56:03,850
Yeah, all right, how do I rectify that?

2217
02:56:03,850 --> 02:56:12,639
I have, I, it's either this, this, this, this.

2218
02:56:12,639 --> 02:56:18,409
Well, I, what do you want me to do?

2219
02:56:18,409 --> 02:56:22,209
This, wow, hi, hey, it's me, fucking hey.

2220
02:56:22,250 --> 02:56:27,110
I'm apparently doing a female voice right now.

2221
02:56:27,110 --> 02:56:36,659
We know what to do.

2222
02:56:36,659 --> 02:56:38,899
The bus has finally been repaired.

2223
02:56:38,899 --> 02:56:43,459
We can start operating again.

2224
02:56:43,459 --> 02:56:46,690
Prince Malo, we want you to go to Bowser's Keep.

2225
02:56:46,690 --> 02:56:49,729
Could you give us a little piece?

2226
02:56:49,729 --> 02:56:51,850
I've heard the story from King Nimbus.

2227
02:56:51,850 --> 02:56:58,200
You'll be there in no time.

2228
02:56:58,200 --> 02:57:10,629
Here it comes, here it comes.

2229
02:57:10,629 --> 02:57:12,559
How's the engine running?

2230
02:57:12,559 --> 02:57:16,110
It's pouring like a kid.

2231
02:57:16,110 --> 02:57:19,709
Did you take Prince Malo to the entrance of Bowser's Keep?

2232
02:57:19,709 --> 02:57:21,069
Of course.

2233
02:57:21,069 --> 02:57:23,870
I can't wait to get this thing running again.

2234
02:57:23,870 --> 02:57:34,120
Come, Prince, hop on board.

2235
02:57:34,120 --> 02:57:36,549
All aboard.

2236
02:57:36,549 --> 02:57:40,979
We're off.

2237
02:57:40,979 --> 02:57:42,860
That's just Pac-Man with the mustache on,

2238
02:57:42,860 --> 02:57:44,739
and he rips it off, and it goes, ding.

2239
02:57:44,739 --> 02:57:46,379
Pac-Man joins the battle.

2240
02:57:46,379 --> 02:58:09,219
Are they going to make it?

2241
02:58:09,219 --> 02:58:10,340
Are they going to make it?

2242
02:58:10,340 --> 02:58:11,420
Are they going to make it?

2243
02:58:11,420 --> 02:58:12,379
Are they going to make it?

2244
02:58:12,379 --> 02:58:13,420
Are they going to make it?

2245
02:58:13,420 --> 02:58:17,500
I'm trying to figure out more voices to do.

2246
02:58:17,540 --> 02:58:19,340
You know what I mean?

2247
02:58:19,340 --> 02:58:21,620
Ah, the scent of boiling lava.

2248
02:58:21,620 --> 02:58:23,340
It's so nice to be home.

2249
02:58:23,340 --> 02:58:24,819
Smithy's going to pay for stealing

2250
02:58:24,819 --> 02:58:27,579
my splendid castle from me.

2251
02:58:27,579 --> 02:58:47,059
Boom.

2252
02:58:47,059 --> 02:58:48,180
So pumped up.

2253
02:58:48,180 --> 02:58:56,170
Everyone's so leveled up and pumped up, I love it.

2254
02:58:56,170 --> 02:59:06,319
Why did you tell Nintendo to put Sans in Smash?

2255
02:59:06,319 --> 02:59:11,360
As the last time I used my Twitter,

2256
02:59:11,360 --> 02:59:13,639
I was talking about how I dropped my fucking pajama

2257
02:59:13,639 --> 02:59:16,129
pants drawstrings in the toilet.

2258
02:59:16,129 --> 02:59:17,370
When did I do this?

2259
02:59:17,370 --> 02:59:25,079
When did you think I did this?

2260
02:59:25,079 --> 02:59:34,540
I'm going to go dodge.

2261
02:59:34,540 --> 03:00:01,209
Ooh, find me.

2262
03:00:01,209 --> 03:00:02,209
Here comes the launch.

2263
03:00:02,209 --> 03:00:21,719
All right, here we go.

2264
03:00:21,719 --> 03:00:25,649
Catapult.

2265
03:00:25,649 --> 03:00:28,049
How much does it just get locked in?

2266
03:00:28,049 --> 03:00:40,040
I don't want to miss any secrets.

2267
03:00:40,040 --> 03:00:57,920
Ooh, zero.

2268
03:00:57,920 --> 03:01:00,440
Oh, I want to get it so bad, but I've never

2269
03:01:00,440 --> 03:01:02,840
been able to do it in my whole life.

2270
03:01:02,840 --> 03:01:04,840
I've never been able to do it.

2271
03:01:04,840 --> 03:01:11,700
It's so sad that I can't do it.

2272
03:01:11,700 --> 03:01:27,809
All right, let me try again.

2273
03:01:27,809 --> 03:01:28,329
Damn it.

2274
03:01:28,809 --> 03:01:49,549
Every time I get to 16, my finger just goes, do it quicker.

2275
03:01:49,549 --> 03:01:51,069
Oh my god.

2276
03:01:51,069 --> 03:02:02,110
Oh my god, it's so hard.

2277
03:02:02,110 --> 03:02:04,549
Because Mario just starts to blend into your brain

2278
03:02:04,549 --> 03:02:40,600
after like 20, 30 times.

2279
03:02:40,600 --> 03:02:42,000
37.

2280
03:02:42,000 --> 03:03:00,209
All right, I'm going to try it one more time.

2281
03:03:00,209 --> 03:03:05,950
Oh, no fucking way.

2282
03:03:05,950 --> 03:03:08,829
I can only press a button on one frame.

2283
03:03:08,829 --> 03:03:24,120
37 fucking times in row before I lose my mind.

2284
03:03:24,120 --> 03:03:25,559
What was that, an item?

2285
03:03:25,559 --> 03:03:34,030
What did I get?

2286
03:03:34,030 --> 03:03:37,440
I'm just going to throw this shit away in a minute.

2287
03:03:37,440 --> 03:03:38,959
Do the sound alone?

2288
03:03:38,959 --> 03:03:41,709
I'll try sound alone again.

2289
03:03:41,709 --> 03:03:56,000
I actually had the headphones out for that one when I did 37.

2290
03:03:56,000 --> 03:03:58,069
Croco.

2291
03:03:58,069 --> 03:04:00,059
Uh-oh.

2292
03:04:00,059 --> 03:04:04,700
Hey, Mario, did you remember to use a save point?

2293
03:04:04,700 --> 03:04:08,520
There's plenty of danger up ahead, so it's best to save now.

2294
03:04:08,520 --> 03:04:09,840
You need anything?

2295
03:04:09,840 --> 03:04:13,139
I got some items to sell.

2296
03:04:13,139 --> 03:04:15,770
The heel turn.

2297
03:04:15,770 --> 03:04:26,680
The heel to face turn.

2298
03:04:26,719 --> 03:04:29,159
Chat, don't tell them his webcam is on.

2299
03:04:29,159 --> 03:04:35,329
That would be fucking funny.

2300
03:04:35,329 --> 03:04:36,090
It's just on.

2301
03:04:36,090 --> 03:04:39,479
All right, I'm getting rid of these.

2302
03:04:39,479 --> 03:04:47,399
Paper syrup.

2303
03:04:47,399 --> 03:04:57,870
All right, I'm going to get some testing case.

2304
03:04:57,870 --> 03:05:00,799
Yeah, all right.

2305
03:05:00,799 --> 03:05:01,959
All right.

2306
03:05:01,959 --> 03:05:04,510
The webcam is on.

2307
03:05:04,510 --> 03:05:05,270
Your webcam is on.

2308
03:05:05,270 --> 03:05:12,840
It's pointed at your mushy feet.

2309
03:05:12,840 --> 03:05:15,520
Mushy feet?

2310
03:05:15,520 --> 03:05:20,700
What the fuck?

2311
03:05:20,700 --> 03:05:22,860
I don't even know what that's supposed to mean.

2312
03:05:22,860 --> 03:05:25,860
Welcome to There Are Six Doors.

2313
03:05:25,860 --> 03:05:29,799
Do you need an explanation?

2314
03:05:29,799 --> 03:05:32,370
Sure, why not for all of you.

2315
03:05:32,370 --> 03:05:37,760
Of the six doors, two open into action courses.

2316
03:05:37,760 --> 03:05:42,600
You can handle a lot of action, right?

2317
03:05:42,600 --> 03:05:46,770
Two others will lead you to battle courses.

2318
03:05:46,770 --> 03:05:50,270
And you're good at fighting, right?

2319
03:05:50,270 --> 03:05:52,549
The last two open into puzzle courses.

2320
03:05:52,549 --> 03:05:56,809
No sweat for a great puzzle solver like you, right?

2321
03:05:56,809 --> 03:05:59,479
Good puzzle solver.

2322
03:05:59,479 --> 03:06:03,459
Once you choose a course, there's no turning back.

2323
03:06:03,459 --> 03:06:04,819
You get only one way.

2324
03:06:04,819 --> 03:06:07,340
The only way to know what's behind a door

2325
03:06:07,340 --> 03:06:09,280
is to walk through it.

2326
03:06:09,280 --> 03:06:13,520
You must pass four of the six courses to move on.

2327
03:06:13,520 --> 03:06:14,040
Good luck.

2328
03:06:14,040 --> 03:06:16,440
You're going to need it, I know.

2329
03:06:16,440 --> 03:06:21,799
Trust me.

2330
03:06:21,799 --> 03:06:31,379
Which door do you want me to do?

2331
03:06:31,379 --> 03:06:44,000
This is actually going to be harder than I thought.

2332
03:06:44,000 --> 03:06:46,680
All right, let's do fuck.

2333
03:06:46,680 --> 03:06:49,239
Actually, I don't know if we can do this.

2334
03:06:49,239 --> 03:06:50,600
Because I can't really zoom in.

2335
03:06:50,600 --> 03:06:59,879
Because this is going to be a pain in the ass,

2336
03:06:59,879 --> 03:07:08,940
but I'm going to do it.

2337
03:07:08,940 --> 03:07:14,360
There you go.

2338
03:07:14,360 --> 03:07:16,979
Where are we going?

2339
03:07:16,979 --> 03:07:18,870
Which door?

2340
03:07:18,870 --> 03:08:23,000
Choose wisely.

2341
03:08:23,000 --> 03:08:23,840
What are you guys clicking?

2342
03:08:23,840 --> 03:08:29,870
What are you doing?

2343
03:08:29,870 --> 03:08:37,690
All right, looks like we're going five.

2344
03:08:37,690 --> 03:08:51,260
Into five we go, but now I have to fix this.

2345
03:08:51,260 --> 03:08:59,489
This is what I was afraid of.

2346
03:08:59,489 --> 03:09:06,750
Okay, five.

2347
03:09:06,750 --> 03:09:09,709
Hey, hey, hey, it's me, the quiz master.

2348
03:09:09,709 --> 03:09:11,989
And it's quiz time.

2349
03:09:11,989 --> 03:09:15,319
So you need an explanation.

2350
03:09:15,319 --> 03:09:19,000
I'll give you 12, count them, 12 questions.

2351
03:09:19,000 --> 03:09:21,000
If you're right, the block you're standing on

2352
03:09:21,000 --> 03:09:22,520
will move up one.

2353
03:09:22,520 --> 03:09:25,600
But if you blow it, you got down two.

2354
03:09:25,600 --> 03:09:28,559
You have five seconds.

2355
03:09:28,559 --> 03:09:31,719
If you can't answer, you'll move down.

2356
03:09:31,719 --> 03:09:34,479
Reach the eighth step within 12 questions, and you've won.

2357
03:09:34,479 --> 03:09:36,920
Do you got it?

2358
03:09:36,920 --> 03:09:42,489
Johnny loves which beverage?

2359
03:09:42,489 --> 03:09:43,489
Curators.

2360
03:09:43,489 --> 03:09:46,190
What's the password in the sunken ship?

2361
03:09:46,190 --> 03:09:48,510
Pearls.

2362
03:09:48,510 --> 03:09:56,770
The man getting his picture taken at Marymoor hates what?

2363
03:09:56,770 --> 03:09:59,239
Getting his picture taken.

2364
03:09:59,239 --> 03:10:03,170
Where was the third star piece found?

2365
03:10:03,170 --> 03:10:08,030
Moleville, Forest Bays, Star Hill, Moleville.

2366
03:10:08,030 --> 03:10:09,709
The boy getting his picture taken at Marymoor

2367
03:10:09,709 --> 03:10:15,120
can't wait till which season?

2368
03:10:15,120 --> 03:10:17,479
Uh-oh, skiing.

2369
03:10:17,479 --> 03:10:20,200
Who was the famous composer at Tadpole Pond?

2370
03:10:20,200 --> 03:10:24,790
That would be Todoth Skiing.

2371
03:10:24,790 --> 03:10:28,149
What technique does Bowser learn at level 15?

2372
03:10:28,149 --> 03:10:33,290
Uh, crusher.

2373
03:10:33,290 --> 03:10:36,129
What's the chef's name at Marymoor?

2374
03:10:36,129 --> 03:10:39,969
Torch.

2375
03:10:39,969 --> 03:10:41,010
Well done.

2376
03:10:41,010 --> 03:10:46,079
I guess that was just a warm up for you, huh?

2377
03:10:46,079 --> 03:10:50,329
All right.

2378
03:10:50,329 --> 03:10:52,690
Let's see how well you can count.

2379
03:10:52,690 --> 03:10:54,290
I'll give you 10 seconds.

2380
03:10:54,290 --> 03:11:00,379
10, tell me the number of barrels in the room.

2381
03:11:00,379 --> 03:11:05,909
Close your eyes for a second.

2382
03:11:05,909 --> 03:11:06,989
Are you ready?

2383
03:11:06,989 --> 03:11:09,200
OK, here we go, here we go, 10 seconds.

2384
03:11:09,200 --> 03:11:10,079
Go.

2385
03:11:10,079 --> 03:11:17,559
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16.

2386
03:11:17,559 --> 03:11:18,639
16, right?

2387
03:11:18,639 --> 03:11:23,239
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 16, 15.

2388
03:11:23,239 --> 03:11:26,260
Correct.

2389
03:11:26,260 --> 03:11:27,780
But this is just a warm up.

2390
03:11:27,780 --> 03:11:34,600
Next.

2391
03:11:34,600 --> 03:11:36,440
Now we'll see if you can really count.

2392
03:11:36,440 --> 03:11:38,399
You've got 20 seconds.

2393
03:11:38,399 --> 03:11:41,870
Ready?

2394
03:11:41,870 --> 03:11:54,309
1, 2, 3, 3, 6, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37,

2395
03:11:55,309 --> 03:12:10,239
43, 44, 45, 46, 46, final answer.

2396
03:12:10,239 --> 03:12:15,190
Piece of cake.

2397
03:12:15,190 --> 03:12:18,129
Now for something completely different.

2398
03:12:18,129 --> 03:12:23,069
Boo, Goo, Bones, and Kip completed in a triathlon.

2399
03:12:23,069 --> 03:12:27,790
The triathlon included swimming, cycling, and a marathon.

2400
03:12:27,790 --> 03:12:32,350
It's up to you to guess which place each person came in.

2401
03:12:32,350 --> 03:12:42,129
Listen well, you're only going to hear the story once.

2402
03:12:42,129 --> 03:12:45,879
I came in third place for swimming.

2403
03:12:45,920 --> 03:12:50,000
So Boo, third place for swimming.

2404
03:12:50,000 --> 03:12:53,079
I came in third place for swimming.

2405
03:12:53,079 --> 03:13:00,040
Goo, I out-rode Bones on my bike and Bones was never able to pass me.

2406
03:13:00,040 --> 03:13:02,159
Okay.

2407
03:13:02,159 --> 03:13:04,079
Boo, third swimming.

2408
03:13:04,079 --> 03:13:08,959
Goo passed Bones on cycling.

2409
03:13:08,959 --> 03:13:12,590
And Bones was never able to pass.

2410
03:13:12,590 --> 03:13:15,149
I fell into fourth place during the bike race,

2411
03:13:15,149 --> 03:13:20,510
but finally ended up in the same place as I did in the swimming event.

2412
03:13:20,510 --> 03:13:21,989
Okay, so this is third, hold on.

2413
03:13:22,829 --> 03:13:24,309
I fell into fourth place during the bike race,

2414
03:13:24,309 --> 03:13:27,889
finally ended up in the same, so he was in fourth place,

2415
03:13:27,889 --> 03:13:29,250
fourth of the bike race.

2416
03:13:29,250 --> 03:13:31,489
Goo was third place in the bike race.

2417
03:13:31,489 --> 03:13:32,450
He might have been second though,

2418
03:13:32,450 --> 03:13:38,000
just because he didn't pass him doesn't mean anything.

2419
03:13:38,000 --> 03:13:41,090
But finally ended up in the same, okay, what about the fish?

2420
03:13:41,090 --> 03:13:43,489
I placed the same in the swimming and cycling events,

2421
03:13:43,489 --> 03:13:45,450
but two others beat me in the marathon.

2422
03:13:49,629 --> 03:13:52,379
I came in third for swimming.

2423
03:13:52,379 --> 03:13:58,090
I fell into fourth, okay.

2424
03:13:58,090 --> 03:14:04,350
So he's fourth in both.

2425
03:14:04,350 --> 03:14:06,389
So he's in fourth place.

2426
03:14:06,389 --> 03:14:10,219
He's in third place for swimming.

2427
03:14:10,219 --> 03:14:12,379
Oh, Bones is my bike, okay.

2428
03:14:12,379 --> 03:14:15,180
What did you do?

2429
03:14:15,180 --> 03:14:19,350
So you're first.

2430
03:14:19,350 --> 03:14:21,750
No, two others beat me in the marathon.

2431
03:14:21,750 --> 03:14:34,549
Are you first?

2432
03:14:34,549 --> 03:14:37,629
I fell into fourth place during the bike race,

2433
03:14:37,629 --> 03:14:39,229
but finally ended up in the same place

2434
03:14:39,229 --> 03:14:45,819
as I did in the swimming event.

2435
03:14:45,819 --> 03:14:47,579
But finally ended up in the same place

2436
03:14:47,579 --> 03:14:49,299
as I did in the swimming event.

2437
03:14:49,299 --> 03:14:59,750
But what did you put up with the marathon?

2438
03:14:59,750 --> 03:15:02,790
I think the fish is first or second.

2439
03:15:02,790 --> 03:15:03,829
Two others beat me in the marathon.

2440
03:15:03,829 --> 03:15:07,469
So what did you go in the marathon?

2441
03:15:07,469 --> 03:15:12,209
What did you do in the marathon?

2442
03:15:12,209 --> 03:15:21,940
We only have one piece of evidence for the marathon.

2443
03:15:21,940 --> 03:15:23,020
Two others, yeah, two others beat me.

2444
03:15:23,020 --> 03:15:26,840
So you're in either third or fourth place.

2445
03:15:26,840 --> 03:15:32,840
For the marathon, that's the only information we have.

2446
03:15:32,840 --> 03:15:42,239
So who won the marathon?

2447
03:15:42,239 --> 03:15:44,690
Hold on, I'm gonna draw this.

2448
03:15:44,690 --> 03:16:02,920
I have to draw this.

2449
03:16:02,920 --> 03:16:04,399
Give me one second.

2450
03:16:04,399 --> 03:16:10,670
I actually do have to like write this out.

2451
03:16:10,670 --> 03:16:12,350
I have to put this on another monitor though.

2452
03:16:12,350 --> 03:16:27,360
Okay, so let's go back here.

2453
03:16:27,360 --> 03:16:28,200
I don't wanna lose this,

2454
03:16:28,200 --> 03:16:34,840
because I'll lose and I don't wanna restart it.

2455
03:16:34,840 --> 03:16:39,079
Okay, so let's do, let me get this right.

2456
03:16:39,079 --> 03:16:42,639
Let's get paint captured so you can see it.

2457
03:16:42,639 --> 03:16:47,250
Not as well.

2458
03:16:47,250 --> 03:16:56,500
Paint, okay, here.

2459
03:16:56,500 --> 03:17:07,190
All right, so we got three events, right?

2460
03:17:07,190 --> 03:17:17,129
So we have this marathon, swimming,

2461
03:17:20,799 --> 03:17:27,920
marathon and cycling.

2462
03:17:27,920 --> 03:17:42,389
Why is this so huge?

2463
03:17:42,389 --> 03:17:44,559
Okay, that's fine.

2464
03:17:44,559 --> 03:17:47,840
So swimming, so Boo came in third for swimming.

2465
03:17:47,840 --> 03:17:54,430
So we're gonna do this.

2466
03:17:54,430 --> 03:17:59,700
One, two, two.

2467
03:17:59,700 --> 03:18:01,870
Okay, so swimming.

2468
03:18:01,870 --> 03:18:06,719
So this is Boo.

2469
03:18:06,719 --> 03:18:09,040
Boo came in third place for swimming.

2470
03:18:09,040 --> 03:18:12,120
I outrode Bones on my bike

2471
03:18:12,120 --> 03:18:17,120
and Bones couldn't pass me in cycling.

2472
03:18:17,120 --> 03:18:27,440
Okay, I fell into fourth place during the bike race.

2473
03:18:27,440 --> 03:18:31,690
Okay, but finally ended up in the same place

2474
03:18:31,690 --> 03:18:38,829
as I did in the swimming event, fourth place.

2475
03:18:38,829 --> 03:18:41,229
I hate this fucking trick question wording,

2476
03:18:42,069 --> 03:18:43,469
but finally ended up in the same place

2477
03:18:43,469 --> 03:18:45,309
as I did in the swimming event.

2478
03:18:45,309 --> 03:18:51,129
What do I mean as I did in the swimming event?

2479
03:18:51,129 --> 03:18:54,690
I was in fourth place during the bike race,

2480
03:18:54,690 --> 03:18:59,459
but finally ended up in the same place

2481
03:18:59,459 --> 03:19:01,799
as I did in the swimming event.

2482
03:19:01,799 --> 03:19:03,920
But where did you place in the swimming event?

2483
03:19:03,920 --> 03:19:13,989
We don't know that.

2484
03:19:13,989 --> 03:19:16,069
So no, then you're in fourth,

2485
03:19:16,069 --> 03:19:20,709
you have to be in second place then.

2486
03:19:20,709 --> 03:19:22,309
Just because you fell into fourth place, doesn't,

2487
03:19:22,309 --> 03:19:28,489
so Goomba wins, Goomba won the cycling.

2488
03:19:28,489 --> 03:19:33,799
There's no other alternative.

2489
03:19:33,799 --> 03:19:42,540
It's a trick question bullshit.

2490
03:19:42,540 --> 03:19:49,360
And then so you're second place in the swimming event.

2491
03:19:49,360 --> 03:19:51,850
So there we go, okay.

2492
03:19:51,850 --> 03:19:59,209
So Bones, I placed the same

2493
03:19:59,209 --> 03:20:05,620
in the swimming and cycling events.

2494
03:20:05,620 --> 03:20:07,780
Hold on, I gotta fucking move these.

2495
03:20:07,780 --> 03:20:13,659
These are all fucked up.

2496
03:20:13,659 --> 03:20:17,159
I placed the same in the swimming and cycling events.

2497
03:20:17,159 --> 03:20:19,409
So you're third place.

2498
03:20:19,409 --> 03:20:21,469
So Boo, no, Boo's third place in swimming.

2499
03:20:21,469 --> 03:20:26,079
So you'd have to be last place.

2500
03:20:26,079 --> 03:20:28,479
So Bones was not last place in the cycling event.

2501
03:20:28,479 --> 03:20:31,950
So this is, so the two fish came in the last

2502
03:20:31,950 --> 03:20:37,680
in swimming and cycling.

2503
03:20:37,680 --> 03:20:42,239
But Bones said he was in last place.

2504
03:20:42,239 --> 03:20:44,159
No, I fell into fourth place during the bike race,

2505
03:20:44,159 --> 03:20:45,639
but I finally ended up in the same place

2506
03:20:45,639 --> 03:20:57,870
that I didn't, so you didn't, you didn't, not in fourth place.

2507
03:20:57,870 --> 03:21:00,549
What is, I came in third for swimming, that's it.

2508
03:21:00,549 --> 03:21:03,079
We know that.

2509
03:21:03,079 --> 03:21:07,979
Okay, I outrode, I placed the same

2510
03:21:07,979 --> 03:21:13,159
in the swimming and cycling events, but, okay.

2511
03:21:13,159 --> 03:21:14,559
Two others beat me in the marathon.

2512
03:21:14,559 --> 03:21:20,950
So you have to, you have to be here.

2513
03:21:20,950 --> 03:21:22,069
One of these two places.

2514
03:21:22,069 --> 03:21:24,469
Two people beat you.

2515
03:21:24,510 --> 03:21:32,219
One of these two.

2516
03:21:32,219 --> 03:21:33,299
Baby, I got Bones here.

2517
03:21:33,299 --> 03:21:40,760
Bones is second in swimming and cycling.

2518
03:21:40,760 --> 03:21:48,879
If he was fourth, who would be the fourth?

2519
03:21:48,879 --> 03:21:54,430
So then Bones is down here.

2520
03:21:54,430 --> 03:21:56,309
How do I get, I have to delete that.

2521
03:21:56,309 --> 03:22:06,870
That's fucking me up.

2522
03:22:06,870 --> 03:22:16,459
But then who was fourth in cycling?

2523
03:22:16,459 --> 03:22:31,879
Did you win the swimming event?

2524
03:22:31,879 --> 03:22:41,639
So we got fish would be last in cycling

2525
03:22:41,680 --> 03:22:49,379
because, and then, so you'd be last in swimming too.

2526
03:22:49,379 --> 03:22:50,979
Fish won swimming because he's a fish.

2527
03:22:50,979 --> 03:23:00,239
That doesn't, that's not how this works.

2528
03:23:00,319 --> 03:23:02,780
Fish is definitely gonna be last in swimming.

2529
03:23:02,780 --> 03:23:04,180
So here you go, we've deduced it.

2530
03:23:04,180 --> 03:23:14,879
So then now, boo, I got cycling done.

2531
03:23:14,879 --> 03:23:17,309
Use Excel instead.

2532
03:23:17,309 --> 03:23:23,110
I don't even have Excel.

2533
03:23:23,110 --> 03:23:24,510
Fish is last in swimming.

2534
03:23:29,659 --> 03:23:33,569
I'm telling you, it's correct.

2535
03:23:33,569 --> 03:23:34,690
Let me see.

2536
03:23:34,690 --> 03:23:35,649
Fish.

2537
03:23:35,649 --> 03:23:37,010
I got, let me just look at it.

2538
03:23:37,010 --> 03:23:38,850
Fish is, he had that, fish is there.

2539
03:23:38,850 --> 03:23:48,819
Is everybody there three times?

2540
03:23:48,819 --> 03:23:54,379
He's a fish, he, but that doesn't matter.

2541
03:23:54,379 --> 03:24:03,000
All right, I'm gonna, I think I got it.

2542
03:24:03,000 --> 03:24:05,559
Call me the master, okay.

2543
03:24:05,559 --> 03:24:11,600
In the order they came in.

2544
03:24:11,600 --> 03:24:14,120
This is for the, okay.

2545
03:24:14,120 --> 03:24:44,799
Let's just fucking guess.

2546
03:24:44,799 --> 03:24:46,799
I looked it up and I Googled it and it was wrong.

2547
03:24:46,799 --> 03:24:49,520
I Googled it, there was a Reddit thread and I,

2548
03:24:49,520 --> 03:24:51,360
it was wrong, the Reddit thread was wrong.

2549
03:25:17,440 --> 03:25:18,559
Mario won't get up.

2550
03:25:18,559 --> 03:25:20,579
Why won't Mario get up?

2551
03:25:20,579 --> 03:25:33,739
Okay, imagine cheating and losing.

2552
03:25:33,739 --> 03:25:35,579
Okay, let's do it again.

2553
03:25:35,579 --> 03:25:38,930
I gotta do all this shit again.

2554
03:25:38,930 --> 03:25:41,680
Cycling was the second event, yeah.

2555
03:25:41,680 --> 03:25:55,600
Just get this off the fucking screen.

2556
03:25:55,600 --> 03:25:58,399
What's the first monster you see in the pipe vault?

2557
03:25:58,399 --> 03:26:00,520
I don't know, I don't remember.

2558
03:26:00,520 --> 03:26:02,899
Sparky, I think.

2559
03:26:02,899 --> 03:26:15,500
All right, this is, I gotta move this back to normal.

2560
03:26:15,500 --> 03:26:18,959
This is why I didn't wanna resize anything.

2561
03:26:18,959 --> 03:26:20,840
What is Rainy's husband's name?

2562
03:26:20,840 --> 03:26:23,899
Raz, yeah.

2563
03:26:23,899 --> 03:26:25,659
Yardovich is what?

2564
03:26:25,659 --> 03:26:27,979
A breed of cattle, a boss.

2565
03:26:27,979 --> 03:26:29,780
What technique does Bowser learn at level 15?

2566
03:26:29,780 --> 03:26:33,159
That would be crusher.

2567
03:26:33,159 --> 03:26:34,639
Fit to screen, I don't wanna do that

2568
03:26:34,639 --> 03:26:35,879
because it's capturing.

2569
03:26:35,879 --> 03:26:37,479
I'll show you what happens if I do that.

2570
03:26:37,479 --> 03:26:40,129
Fit to screen does this

2571
03:26:40,129 --> 03:26:44,129
because it is a old game being pulled through HDMI.

2572
03:26:44,129 --> 03:26:52,680
The wonders of technology.

2573
03:26:52,680 --> 03:26:55,950
What the fuck is it doing now?

2574
03:26:55,950 --> 03:26:58,190
Okay, what's the name of the sunken ship?

2575
03:26:58,190 --> 03:27:00,959
Johnny.

2576
03:27:00,959 --> 03:27:02,680
What does Balon really like to turn people into?

2577
03:27:02,680 --> 03:27:05,000
Scarecrows.

2578
03:27:05,000 --> 03:27:05,840
A man getting his picture taken.

2579
03:27:05,840 --> 03:27:06,680
A merry boy hates what?

2580
03:27:06,680 --> 03:27:09,520
Getting his picture taken.

2581
03:27:09,520 --> 03:27:11,079
Who is the leader of the Axum Rangers?

2582
03:27:11,079 --> 03:27:12,719
Red.

2583
03:27:12,719 --> 03:27:16,250
Hey.

2584
03:27:16,250 --> 03:27:21,079
All right, we gotta do more counting, I think.

2585
03:27:21,079 --> 03:27:27,200
Time to count.

2586
03:27:27,200 --> 03:27:29,920
Wait, I already did this, right?

2587
03:27:29,920 --> 03:27:31,860
Yeah, I know this one.

2588
03:27:31,860 --> 03:27:33,540
Oh, I think he's gonna change it up.

2589
03:27:33,540 --> 03:27:40,000
Isn't it the same number, though?

2590
03:27:40,000 --> 03:27:44,930
13.

2591
03:27:44,930 --> 03:27:45,770
Was it 13?

2592
03:27:45,809 --> 03:27:46,690
Was it 13 or 14?

2593
03:27:46,690 --> 03:27:49,200
Oh, fuck, I think it was 14.

2594
03:27:49,200 --> 03:27:57,149
Okay, I didn't count the one under here.

2595
03:27:57,149 --> 03:28:01,489
Ha ha ha.

2596
03:28:01,489 --> 03:28:21,649
All right, I'm ready.

2597
03:28:21,649 --> 03:28:24,040
43.

2598
03:28:24,040 --> 03:28:26,909
43, 44.

2599
03:28:26,909 --> 03:28:29,120
44?

2600
03:28:29,120 --> 03:28:31,399
I think it's 44?

2601
03:28:31,399 --> 03:28:45,309
Yeah.

2602
03:28:45,309 --> 03:28:46,510
Ha, here we are again.

2603
03:28:59,889 --> 03:29:02,409
Oh no, wait, they changed.

2604
03:29:02,409 --> 03:29:04,290
I outrode Kip on my bike

2605
03:29:04,290 --> 03:29:06,889
and Kip was never able to pass me.

2606
03:29:06,889 --> 03:29:08,920
I came in third for swimming.

2607
03:29:08,920 --> 03:29:12,260
No, it's the same thing.

2608
03:29:12,260 --> 03:29:13,840
It's just different people.

2609
03:29:13,879 --> 03:29:15,319
I fell into fourth place during the bike, see?

2610
03:29:15,319 --> 03:29:17,639
Oh, the fish is in first place for swimming.

2611
03:29:17,639 --> 03:29:23,040
No.

2612
03:29:23,040 --> 03:29:32,829
Okay, Kip is the fish.

2613
03:29:32,829 --> 03:29:34,469
I fell into fourth place during the bike race

2614
03:29:34,469 --> 03:29:35,510
but finally ended up in the same place

2615
03:29:35,510 --> 03:29:37,680
I did in the swimming event.

2616
03:29:37,680 --> 03:29:40,000
I'm not cheating, you can't cheat.

2617
03:29:40,000 --> 03:29:41,440
Just guess, there's a one in four chance.

2618
03:29:41,440 --> 03:29:43,159
No, there's not, it's like a one in fucking,

2619
03:29:43,159 --> 03:30:43,000
like 32% chance.

2620
03:30:43,000 --> 03:30:44,809
I don't have Excel.

2621
03:30:44,809 --> 03:30:47,090
I can't use Excel, I don't own it.

2622
03:30:47,090 --> 03:30:49,049
Okay, here we go, I'm gonna do this one.

2623
03:30:49,049 --> 03:30:49,889
I'm going for it, here we go.

2624
03:30:49,889 --> 03:30:51,530
This is where, here we go.

2625
03:30:51,530 --> 03:30:53,129
I came in third for swimming.

2626
03:30:55,809 --> 03:30:56,969
I'm just gonna write it, it doesn't matter.

2627
03:30:56,969 --> 03:30:59,129
It's easy for me to do it like this.

2628
03:30:59,129 --> 03:31:00,649
This is goo.

2629
03:31:00,649 --> 03:31:02,530
Third for swimming, that's all I need to know right now.

2630
03:31:02,530 --> 03:31:03,969
Don't need to care about anything else.

2631
03:31:03,969 --> 03:31:05,690
I placed the same in the swimming and cycling events

2632
03:31:05,690 --> 03:31:07,569
but two of them beat me in the marathon.

2633
03:31:07,569 --> 03:31:10,690
Two people beat you in the marathon.

2634
03:31:10,690 --> 03:31:11,930
So that means you have to be in third place

2635
03:31:11,930 --> 03:31:13,329
for the marathon, you have to be.

2636
03:31:13,329 --> 03:31:16,530
If two people beat you in the marathon, that's two and one.

2637
03:31:16,530 --> 03:31:17,930
Bones, you're number three in the marathon.

2638
03:31:17,930 --> 03:31:24,100
Got it, locked in.

2639
03:31:24,100 --> 03:31:28,360
I mean, no.

2640
03:31:28,360 --> 03:31:30,239
Three people would have beat you in the marathon

2641
03:31:30,239 --> 03:31:31,200
if you were in fourth place.

2642
03:31:31,200 --> 03:31:34,110
What are you talking about?

2643
03:31:34,110 --> 03:31:38,600
That's locked in.

2644
03:31:38,600 --> 03:31:41,479
Okay, let's get some more info.

2645
03:31:41,479 --> 03:31:43,920
I fell into fourth place during the bike race

2646
03:31:43,920 --> 03:31:45,920
but I finally ended up in the same place

2647
03:31:45,920 --> 03:31:47,799
as I did in the swimming event.

2648
03:31:47,799 --> 03:31:50,959
Bike race, so fourth place in the bike race.

2649
03:31:50,959 --> 03:31:54,959
Wait, what did Abu do?

2650
03:31:54,959 --> 03:32:06,780
I outrode Kip on my bike and Kip could never pass me.

2651
03:32:06,780 --> 03:32:14,120
I was in fourth place in the cycling event

2652
03:32:14,120 --> 03:32:16,639
but I finally ended up in the same place

2653
03:32:16,639 --> 03:32:17,719
as I did in the swimming event.

2654
03:32:17,719 --> 03:32:20,489
Where did you end up in the swimming event?

2655
03:32:20,489 --> 03:32:22,610
Fourth, third, fourth or second?

2656
03:32:22,610 --> 03:32:25,379
Probably second then, right?

2657
03:32:25,379 --> 03:32:27,139
You had to be second.

2658
03:32:27,139 --> 03:32:37,299
That makes sense.

2659
03:32:37,299 --> 03:32:41,180
So now we've got this info.

2660
03:32:41,180 --> 03:32:45,719
All right, nice.

2661
03:32:45,719 --> 03:32:57,010
Okay, now, what do you mean no?

2662
03:32:57,010 --> 03:33:07,500
No, second in the marathon, second in the marathon, right?

2663
03:33:07,500 --> 03:33:09,459
Yeah, I wrote it in the wrong place.

2664
03:33:09,459 --> 03:33:10,739
Everybody settle down.

2665
03:33:10,739 --> 03:33:20,579
I wrote it in the wrong place

2666
03:33:20,579 --> 03:33:22,180
but I finally ended in the same place

2667
03:33:22,180 --> 03:33:26,450
as I did in the swimming event.

2668
03:33:26,450 --> 03:33:41,170
Second fucking place, fourth place?

2669
03:33:41,170 --> 03:33:42,209
I think he is in second place.

2670
03:33:42,209 --> 03:33:43,209
All right, hold on, what about Bones?

2671
03:33:43,610 --> 03:33:44,690
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2672
03:33:44,690 --> 03:33:46,540
No, what about Boo?

2673
03:33:46,540 --> 03:33:49,299
I outrode Kip on my bike and Kip,

2674
03:33:49,299 --> 03:33:59,059
so you're in first place or second place.

2675
03:33:59,059 --> 03:34:08,329
Boo has to be in first place, you have to be.

2676
03:34:08,329 --> 03:34:11,600
So Boo is in first place in cycling.

2677
03:34:11,600 --> 03:34:17,819
That means Kip.

2678
03:34:17,819 --> 03:34:19,299
Boo could also be second.

2679
03:34:19,299 --> 03:34:22,250
Let's just do that.

2680
03:34:22,250 --> 03:34:23,370
So Kip had to get second.

2681
03:34:23,370 --> 03:34:32,079
So why is everybody screaming at me?

2682
03:34:32,079 --> 03:34:33,680
Kip was fourth in cycling.

2683
03:34:33,680 --> 03:34:35,270
What?

2684
03:34:35,270 --> 03:34:36,229
We are dumb.

2685
03:34:36,229 --> 03:34:37,549
No, what?

2686
03:34:37,549 --> 03:34:40,069
Kip was, yeah, Kip was second.

2687
03:34:40,069 --> 03:34:40,909
I'm going with this.

2688
03:34:40,909 --> 03:34:41,950
Kip is second in everything.

2689
03:34:41,950 --> 03:34:44,079
I agree.

2690
03:34:44,079 --> 03:34:46,280
So that leaves us, what the hell did Bones do?

2691
03:34:46,280 --> 03:34:51,559
I placed the same in the swimming and cycling events.

2692
03:34:51,559 --> 03:34:56,040
So fourth place.

2693
03:34:56,040 --> 03:34:58,440
He says he's, no, no, look, look, look.

2694
03:34:58,440 --> 03:35:00,479
I fell into fourth place.

2695
03:35:00,479 --> 03:35:01,639
Don't listen to that bullshit.

2696
03:35:01,639 --> 03:35:03,719
That is a trick.

2697
03:35:03,719 --> 03:35:06,719
I fell into fourth place during the bike race

2698
03:35:06,719 --> 03:35:10,079
but I finally ended up in the same place

2699
03:35:10,079 --> 03:35:11,319
as I did in the swimming event.

2700
03:35:11,319 --> 03:35:19,750
That is a fake bullshit.

2701
03:35:19,750 --> 03:35:21,110
Come on, I'm trying.

2702
03:35:21,110 --> 03:35:21,950
Look at it.

2703
03:35:21,950 --> 03:35:23,270
That's what it says.

2704
03:35:23,270 --> 03:35:24,590
It's a fake out.

2705
03:35:24,590 --> 03:35:25,590
Don't believe it.

2706
03:35:25,590 --> 03:35:26,829
Now you got me all messed up.

2707
03:35:26,829 --> 03:35:28,440
Where am I going?

2708
03:35:28,440 --> 03:35:29,360
Bones.

2709
03:35:29,360 --> 03:35:31,680
I placed the same in the swimming and cycling events.

2710
03:35:31,680 --> 03:35:33,670
What did we have them over here?

2711
03:35:33,670 --> 03:35:35,600
Okay.

2712
03:35:35,600 --> 03:35:37,709
Two others beat me in the marathon.

2713
03:35:37,709 --> 03:35:40,469
So swimming and cycling events.

2714
03:35:40,469 --> 03:35:42,350
So you're in last place.

2715
03:35:42,350 --> 03:35:44,700
Because then,

2716
03:35:44,700 --> 03:35:46,180
Goo, what'd you do, Goo?

2717
03:35:46,180 --> 03:35:47,379
I came in third for swimming.

2718
03:35:47,379 --> 03:36:02,760
So yeah, you came in third here too.

2719
03:36:02,760 --> 03:36:04,760
He can't.

2720
03:36:04,760 --> 03:36:06,600
I outrode Kip on my bike.

2721
03:36:06,600 --> 03:36:08,469
Okay.

2722
03:36:08,510 --> 03:36:09,389
I placed in the same,

2723
03:36:09,389 --> 03:36:15,100
I placed the same.

2724
03:36:15,100 --> 03:36:17,389
It's a 50-50.

2725
03:36:17,389 --> 03:36:19,149
Two others beat me in the marathon.

2726
03:36:19,149 --> 03:36:20,239
Yeah.

2727
03:36:20,239 --> 03:36:23,799
One, two.

2728
03:36:23,799 --> 03:36:33,819
Not one, two, three.

2729
03:36:33,819 --> 03:36:37,590
All right.

2730
03:36:37,590 --> 03:36:39,549
Who is in first place in the marathon then?

2731
03:36:39,549 --> 03:36:40,709
It has to be Boo.

2732
03:36:40,709 --> 03:36:44,059
No.

2733
03:36:44,059 --> 03:36:50,959
I think it is Boo.

2734
03:36:50,959 --> 03:36:54,370
I think it's Boo, Kip, Bones,

2735
03:36:54,370 --> 03:37:01,520
and then Goo.

2736
03:37:01,520 --> 03:37:07,250
I think that's it.

2737
03:37:07,250 --> 03:37:15,649
I think that's correct.

2738
03:37:15,649 --> 03:37:16,489
I'm going for it.

2739
03:37:16,489 --> 03:37:20,719
Boo, Kip, Bones, Goo.

2740
03:37:24,750 --> 03:37:47,350
Boo, Kip, Bones, Goo.

2741
03:37:47,350 --> 03:38:13,780
Yeah!

2742
03:38:13,780 --> 03:38:16,399
Correct.

2743
03:38:16,399 --> 03:38:18,370
You got a rock candy.

2744
03:38:18,370 --> 03:38:28,000
Lame.

2745
03:38:28,000 --> 03:38:28,840
All right.

2746
03:38:28,840 --> 03:38:31,049
Time for a new door.

2747
03:38:31,049 --> 03:38:38,500
We might need that again.

2748
03:38:38,500 --> 03:38:42,440
For every percentage that clicks on number five,

2749
03:38:42,440 --> 03:38:44,719
one minute is deducted from the final amount

2750
03:38:44,719 --> 03:38:46,000
of time I stream tonight.

2751
03:38:48,200 --> 03:39:00,790
Just making sure you guys are aware of this.

2752
03:39:00,790 --> 03:39:05,760
That's what includes Mario as well.

2753
03:39:05,760 --> 03:39:15,350
Here we go.

2754
03:39:15,350 --> 03:39:17,030
At least 28 minutes.

2755
03:39:17,030 --> 03:39:18,229
50, 60, 70.

2756
03:39:18,229 --> 03:39:19,069
Okay.

2757
03:39:19,069 --> 03:39:21,670
Again, more than an hour is being removed from the stream.

2758
03:39:35,899 --> 03:39:37,819
57 total minutes have been deleted

2759
03:39:37,819 --> 03:39:40,030
from the end of the stream.

2760
03:39:40,030 --> 03:39:41,750
That means it's been about four hours.

2761
03:39:41,750 --> 03:39:43,750
If I was going to stream for like six, six and a half,

2762
03:39:43,750 --> 03:39:50,120
I'm only streaming fucking five.

2763
03:39:50,120 --> 03:39:50,959
30, 40.

2764
03:39:50,959 --> 03:39:51,799
All right.

2765
03:39:51,799 --> 03:39:52,639
Okay.

2766
03:40:00,579 --> 03:40:01,420
All right.

2767
03:40:01,420 --> 03:40:04,920
For one time only.

2768
03:40:04,920 --> 03:40:07,239
So that was over 50 minutes that you guys just deleted.

2769
03:40:07,239 --> 03:40:10,829
For one time only.

2770
03:40:10,829 --> 03:40:14,590
If 100% of you click on Mario's nose,

2771
03:40:14,909 --> 03:40:16,670
I will negate what just happened.

2772
03:40:16,670 --> 03:40:35,040
It has to be 100%.

2773
03:40:35,040 --> 03:40:48,090
Some people just want to watch the world burn.

2774
03:40:48,090 --> 03:40:49,729
10%.

2775
03:40:49,729 --> 03:40:52,549
What a great experiment.

2776
03:40:52,549 --> 03:40:55,549
10% of all people clicking.

2777
03:40:55,549 --> 03:41:00,840
I mean, you're talking about 10% of people.

2778
03:41:00,840 --> 03:41:03,069
Just like, yeah.

2779
03:41:03,069 --> 03:41:13,229
Chaos Cartage.

2780
03:41:13,229 --> 03:41:20,010
Trolls.

2781
03:41:20,010 --> 03:41:25,000
Okay.

2782
03:41:25,000 --> 03:41:27,079
Try it again, but this time pick one.

2783
03:41:27,079 --> 03:41:41,540
Actually give me a majority here, please.

2784
03:41:41,540 --> 03:41:55,559
People were spamming.

2785
03:41:55,559 --> 03:41:56,399
Okay.

2786
03:41:56,399 --> 03:41:59,479
Well, we're going in number two.

2787
03:41:59,479 --> 03:42:00,559
Number two it is.

2788
03:42:00,559 --> 03:42:13,670
Thank you for voting.

2789
03:42:13,670 --> 03:42:17,309
Two.

2790
03:42:17,309 --> 03:42:18,909
Oh, this is a fight one.

2791
03:42:18,909 --> 03:42:26,200
You have to fight for everything.

2792
03:42:26,200 --> 03:42:34,790
I feel like it's been so long since I've attacked anybody.

2793
03:42:34,790 --> 03:42:39,860
Once again, once again, once again.

2794
03:42:39,860 --> 03:42:49,069
Do it again.

2795
03:42:49,069 --> 03:42:49,909
Let me do a revote.

2796
03:42:49,909 --> 03:42:53,159
I accidentally clicked on the follow button.

2797
03:42:53,159 --> 03:42:54,399
Well, it's a good thing you accidentally clicked

2798
03:42:54,399 --> 03:42:55,239
on the follow button,

2799
03:42:55,239 --> 03:42:57,569
because that's how you're able to chat.

2800
03:42:57,569 --> 03:42:59,489
So it's good that you did that.

2801
03:43:11,149 --> 03:43:11,989
Unfollow.

2802
03:43:21,569 --> 03:43:25,069
Hey, 21.

2803
03:43:25,989 --> 03:43:28,549
You know what?

2804
03:43:28,549 --> 03:43:34,700
I'm just going to save myself for like 30 seconds to do that.

2805
03:43:34,700 --> 03:43:35,579
It was going to be that.

2806
03:43:35,579 --> 03:43:36,420
It was.

2807
03:43:36,420 --> 03:43:40,120
It was just going to be that.

2808
03:43:40,120 --> 03:43:43,639
Guys, that has happened 20 times in a row.

2809
03:43:43,639 --> 03:43:49,620
Do you really think that this is going to be the one outlier

2810
03:43:49,620 --> 03:43:52,299
where they don't, the 21st time.

2811
03:43:52,299 --> 03:43:55,899
It's not going to be power.

2812
03:43:55,899 --> 03:43:57,219
No way.

2813
03:43:57,219 --> 03:44:10,620
26, nothing.

2814
03:44:10,620 --> 03:44:12,139
Can't block that.

2815
03:44:12,139 --> 03:44:23,799
Once again, the screen's a little cut off.

2816
03:44:23,799 --> 03:44:25,000
I'll fix it in a second.

2817
03:44:34,270 --> 03:44:36,069
This is why I didn't want to restart.

2818
03:44:36,069 --> 03:44:38,350
I'm not, I'm just going to pick next door.

2819
03:44:38,350 --> 03:44:51,020
The next door is streamer's choice.

2820
03:44:51,020 --> 03:44:52,420
It's upside down.

2821
03:44:56,209 --> 03:44:57,049
Mic muted.

2822
03:44:57,049 --> 03:45:00,090
Oh, I definitely shouldn't scream into it then.

2823
03:45:00,090 --> 03:45:12,360
The four keys are enraptured.

2824
03:45:30,049 --> 03:45:36,760
The four keys have come to their senses.

2825
03:45:36,760 --> 03:45:38,780
I got to heal after this.

2826
03:45:38,780 --> 03:45:53,319
Shall I just do it now?

2827
03:45:53,319 --> 03:45:57,590
Peek mic, peek mic, peek mic.

2828
03:45:57,590 --> 03:46:01,129
Okay, I'll peek the mic for your birthday.

2829
03:46:01,129 --> 03:46:14,409
How's that sound?

2830
03:46:14,409 --> 03:46:16,209
It is my birthday.

2831
03:46:16,209 --> 03:46:18,530
No, that, the person that said that,

2832
03:46:18,530 --> 03:46:19,610
whenever their birthday is.

2833
03:46:19,610 --> 03:46:24,290
And I know that, I already know that person's birthday.

2834
03:46:24,290 --> 03:46:30,530
Because I remember their comment from July

2835
03:46:30,530 --> 03:46:31,969
saying it's my birthday, dude.

2836
03:46:31,969 --> 03:46:33,010
And I was like, happy birthday.

2837
03:46:33,010 --> 03:46:48,579
So now for next July.

2838
03:46:48,579 --> 03:46:52,159
Got to wait until July.

2839
03:46:52,159 --> 03:46:53,159
Yeah, I don't want to peek my mic.

2840
03:46:53,159 --> 03:46:54,159
I don't like peeking my mic.

2841
03:46:54,159 --> 03:47:01,569
It hurts people's ears.

2842
03:47:01,569 --> 03:47:04,489
Princess Peach has reached 19.

2843
03:47:04,489 --> 03:47:08,250
All right.

2844
03:47:08,250 --> 03:47:20,129
Just getting it over with.

2845
03:47:20,129 --> 03:47:20,969
So I got a question for you guys.

2846
03:47:20,969 --> 03:47:25,329
So if I ever did a stream where I peeked the mic,

2847
03:47:25,329 --> 03:47:30,329
like, and it was a full peak for like four seconds.

2848
03:47:30,950 --> 03:47:32,790
And then I sampled that peak

2849
03:47:33,670 --> 03:47:36,680
and made it four and a half hours long.

2850
03:47:36,680 --> 03:47:42,100
How many viewers would that stream have?

2851
03:47:42,100 --> 03:47:44,540
Would that stream have more or less than a thousand people

2852
03:47:44,540 --> 03:47:58,549
there?

2853
03:47:58,549 --> 03:48:01,209
Less than a thousand?

2854
03:48:01,209 --> 03:48:02,610
I think that would be at,

2855
03:48:02,610 --> 03:48:06,209
I don't think that would have more than 350 people there.

2856
03:48:21,329 --> 03:48:25,659
I just sit in there listening to that.

2857
03:48:25,659 --> 03:48:29,209
You could just mute.

2858
03:48:29,209 --> 03:48:33,239
Yeah, you could, nevermind.

2859
03:48:33,239 --> 03:48:34,079
You would come to that,

2860
03:48:34,079 --> 03:48:35,639
you would open that stream and it immediately

2861
03:48:35,639 --> 03:48:37,809
hit the mute button.

2862
03:48:37,809 --> 03:48:41,739
It'd be like, oh, let's go, let's go.

2863
03:48:41,739 --> 03:48:43,680
Hey, let me check out,

2864
03:48:43,680 --> 03:48:47,079
let me check out German 985, it's a live stream.

2865
03:48:47,079 --> 03:48:51,129
That sounds like a cool idea.

2866
03:48:51,129 --> 03:49:00,729
Just, I'm just opening the webpage right now.

2867
03:49:00,729 --> 03:49:04,719
Ah!

2868
03:49:04,719 --> 03:49:07,120
The fuck, man.

2869
03:49:07,159 --> 03:49:10,139
That was fucking stupid.

2870
03:49:10,139 --> 03:49:15,829
That is how long it would take.

2871
03:49:15,829 --> 03:49:16,670
Oh, sorry, hold on.

2872
03:49:16,670 --> 03:49:19,180
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

2873
03:49:19,180 --> 03:49:30,110
Let's get this correct.

2874
03:49:30,110 --> 03:49:38,680
Hold on.

2875
03:49:38,680 --> 03:49:42,840
Oh, let's get a, let's get a good representation of this.

2876
03:49:59,979 --> 03:50:12,299
Just give me something.

2877
03:50:12,299 --> 03:50:13,299
All right, what?

2878
03:50:13,299 --> 03:50:17,889
It's like Samsung phones, right?

2879
03:50:17,889 --> 03:50:43,010
What's the current Samsung ad that plays on Twitch?

2880
03:50:43,010 --> 03:50:44,850
Everybody has an ad block.

2881
03:50:44,850 --> 03:50:51,040
You can't tell me what the current ad is.

2882
03:50:51,040 --> 03:50:59,559
Whatever, this will do.

2883
03:50:59,559 --> 03:51:02,239
This will do, who cares?

2884
03:51:04,280 --> 03:51:08,440
All right, back.

2885
03:51:08,440 --> 03:51:53,239
New viewer.

2886
03:51:53,239 --> 03:51:54,079
Ah!

2887
03:52:14,899 --> 03:52:16,860
Wait, you guys didn't get the joke there?

2888
03:52:16,860 --> 03:52:18,379
All ads are broken.

2889
03:52:18,379 --> 03:52:19,500
You can't close them,

2890
03:52:19,500 --> 03:52:43,530
and half of them are fucking muted or way too loud.

2891
03:52:43,530 --> 03:52:44,889
Explain it again.

2892
03:52:44,889 --> 03:52:59,120
Okay, so you see, for some reason.

2893
03:52:59,120 --> 03:53:15,120
No, no, no, I wanted to super jump, what the fuck?

2894
03:53:15,120 --> 03:53:17,229
Explain the joke, Peter.

2895
03:53:17,229 --> 03:53:19,600
All right, I'll give you a joke.

2896
03:53:19,600 --> 03:53:32,479
Watch this.

2897
03:53:32,479 --> 03:54:03,879
God damn it, I'm fucking so mad.

2898
03:54:03,879 --> 03:54:05,600
Why are you doing this?

2899
03:54:05,639 --> 03:54:14,450
Why is it so hard to do this?

2900
03:54:14,450 --> 03:54:23,409
It's so fucking hard to do that.

2901
03:54:23,409 --> 03:54:30,190
What, I get 37 one time?

2902
03:54:30,190 --> 03:54:34,129
You super, that was super jump.

2903
03:54:34,129 --> 03:54:35,930
That wasn't super, I thought that was super jump.

2904
03:54:35,930 --> 03:54:40,360
That wasn't super jump?

2905
03:54:40,360 --> 03:54:55,930
That's super jump.

2906
03:54:55,930 --> 03:54:58,370
Why, why God?

2907
03:54:58,370 --> 03:55:22,399
Tell me, I want an answer, God.

2908
03:55:22,399 --> 03:55:31,569
God, I'm trying this one more time,

2909
03:55:31,569 --> 03:55:39,389
and no, I'm not, nevermind.

2910
03:55:39,389 --> 03:55:41,110
What am I trying to do?

2911
03:55:41,110 --> 03:55:43,069
I'm trying to jump with super jump

2912
03:55:43,069 --> 03:55:49,520
a hundred times on somebody.

2913
03:55:49,520 --> 03:55:51,559
The game changes the timings

2914
03:55:53,399 --> 03:55:56,569
based on how many times you've done it in a row.

2915
03:55:56,569 --> 03:55:57,850
So, for instance,

2916
03:55:59,239 --> 03:56:03,000
if, you know, jump one through 10 is the same.

2917
03:56:03,000 --> 03:56:05,959
Jump like 12 to 20 is different,

2918
03:56:05,959 --> 03:56:09,920
and then like jump like 18 or 20 to like a hundred

2919
03:56:09,920 --> 03:56:39,139
is one frame.

2920
03:56:39,139 --> 03:56:45,000
11 is tricky.

2921
03:56:45,000 --> 03:56:48,239
And the game is 60 FPS.

2922
03:56:48,239 --> 03:57:20,159
Yeah, it is.

2923
03:57:20,159 --> 03:57:22,319
My God, why is it doing it now?

2924
03:57:22,319 --> 03:57:25,360
How do I go from doing 37 of these

2925
03:57:25,360 --> 03:57:27,760
to I can't even do more than 10 now?

2926
03:57:27,760 --> 03:57:57,489
What?

2927
03:57:57,489 --> 03:57:59,329
I'm gonna listen to a fucking tutorial.

2928
03:58:00,739 --> 03:58:04,139
I need to do this.

2929
03:58:04,139 --> 03:58:05,780
Why is the audio coming out of my dumb,

2930
03:58:05,780 --> 03:58:08,020
stupid, shitty BenQ monitor?

2931
03:58:13,190 --> 03:58:14,639
That's not fair.

2932
03:58:14,639 --> 03:58:17,040
BenQ is like, I like this monitor.

2933
03:58:22,290 --> 03:58:23,930
I really like this monitor.

2934
03:58:28,360 --> 03:58:29,440
Okay, hold on.

2935
03:58:29,440 --> 03:58:31,319
Why, what happened to my sound effects?

2936
03:58:31,319 --> 03:58:36,969
Why do I have no sound?

2937
03:58:37,809 --> 03:58:39,889
No, that's gonna get, that's gonna,

2938
03:58:39,889 --> 03:58:43,120
look, Mario does power.

2939
03:58:43,120 --> 03:59:17,629
G-Note, I, what is it doing this for?

2940
03:59:17,629 --> 03:59:35,440
Why, I don't understand.

2941
03:59:35,440 --> 04:00:30,969
I don't understand what's changed.

2942
04:00:30,969 --> 04:00:44,700
This is making me rabidly angry, by the way.

2943
04:00:44,700 --> 04:01:15,840
Did you just heal?

2944
04:01:15,840 --> 04:01:18,000
I'm gonna turn, I'm gonna hit it as fast as I can.

2945
04:01:18,000 --> 04:01:20,079
That's not gonna help it.

2946
04:01:20,079 --> 04:01:21,600
That's not gonna help it.

2947
04:01:21,600 --> 04:01:34,129
I guarantee, it's not gonna help it.

2948
04:01:34,129 --> 04:01:34,969
Whatever.

2949
04:01:51,379 --> 04:01:54,610
I do have the Lazy Shell, but it's cheating.

2950
04:01:54,610 --> 04:01:58,100
I only cheat versus Q-Legs.

2951
04:01:58,100 --> 04:02:00,459
Or, you know, whatever.

2952
04:02:00,459 --> 04:02:18,219
Maybe I'll just put it on.

2953
04:02:18,219 --> 04:02:28,709
I got a lot of health.

2954
04:02:28,709 --> 04:02:32,350
Holy shit, I should've done Lucky.

2955
04:02:32,350 --> 04:02:34,909
All right, I'm going against, I'm going against it here.

2956
04:02:34,909 --> 04:02:36,309
I'm doing Bowser HP.

2957
04:02:36,309 --> 04:02:41,700
I'm sorry, it's my turn.

2958
04:02:41,700 --> 04:02:46,879
Bingo, we got Drill Claw.

2959
04:02:46,879 --> 04:02:54,989
That is Bowser's best weapon.

2960
04:02:54,989 --> 04:02:58,879
Bowser, it can now come back into the party.

2961
04:02:58,879 --> 04:03:02,719
Bowser has the Lazy Shell.

2962
04:03:02,719 --> 04:03:09,139
We're also gonna give Bowser, give Peach the Shell.

2963
04:03:09,139 --> 04:03:11,340
I want Bowser to have the most damage.

2964
04:03:11,340 --> 04:03:14,020
All right, this is okay, all right.

2965
04:03:14,020 --> 04:03:15,420
It's time.

2966
04:03:15,420 --> 04:03:17,579
All right, everybody relax, settle down.

2967
04:03:19,680 --> 04:03:26,399
Time, Gino's gonna take a break.

2968
04:03:26,399 --> 04:03:28,920
Bowser's back.

2969
04:03:28,920 --> 04:03:30,000
Bowser has the Drill Claw.

2970
04:03:30,000 --> 04:03:35,040
Bowser also is gonna put on the Work Pants.

2971
04:03:35,040 --> 04:03:38,840
And I want Bowser to do such an insane amount of damage.

2972
04:03:39,680 --> 04:03:41,399
I want the Attack Scarf on Bowser.

2973
04:03:41,399 --> 04:03:44,600
Oh, you can't wear it, Bowser, what?

2974
04:03:44,600 --> 04:03:46,760
Really?

2975
04:03:46,760 --> 04:04:02,559
Ruins my whole plan.

2976
04:04:02,559 --> 04:04:04,799
Let's give the XP Booster to, let's give it to Gino.

2977
04:04:04,799 --> 04:04:06,559
Oh, Jinx Belt, there we go, yeah.

2978
04:04:09,090 --> 04:04:10,930
You can put on the XP Booster, Gino.

2979
04:04:17,600 --> 04:04:20,270
There we go.

2980
04:04:20,270 --> 04:04:27,770
Bowser's now insane.

2981
04:04:27,770 --> 04:04:31,739
Lazy Shell is not going on just yet.

2982
04:04:31,739 --> 04:04:33,219
Give her the shell, give her the shell,

2983
04:04:33,219 --> 04:04:34,739
give her the shell, give her the shell,

2984
04:04:34,739 --> 04:04:36,340
give her the shell, give her the shell,

2985
04:04:36,340 --> 04:04:37,579
give her the shell.

2986
04:04:37,620 --> 04:04:43,079
No, no, I can't.

2987
04:04:43,079 --> 04:04:45,750
All right, can you guys click these from here?

2988
04:04:45,750 --> 04:05:01,170
Let's find out, hold on.

2989
04:05:01,170 --> 04:05:03,760
Can you guys make it from here?

2990
04:05:03,760 --> 04:05:10,520
Just try, just try.

2991
04:05:10,520 --> 04:05:23,870
Make it pinpoint, be very accurate.

2992
04:05:23,870 --> 04:05:30,030
Pretty good accuracy, 17% on six,

2993
04:05:30,030 --> 04:05:34,729
but what is it on between three and four?

2994
04:05:34,729 --> 04:05:36,729
Well, what is it, what is it?

2995
04:05:36,729 --> 04:05:41,370
9% want me to leave.

2996
04:05:41,370 --> 04:05:48,399
And it looks like that's a giant circle on four.

2997
04:05:48,399 --> 04:05:52,379
That's what I'm gonna have to go with that one.

2998
04:05:52,379 --> 04:05:54,940
That's a giant circle on four.

2999
04:05:54,940 --> 04:06:00,120
Thank you for voting.

3000
04:06:00,120 --> 04:06:07,239
More combat.

3001
04:06:07,239 --> 04:06:09,440
All right, we got, do I have any AOE?

3002
04:06:13,620 --> 04:06:14,459
Peach has AOE, right?

3003
04:06:14,459 --> 04:06:29,510
Yeah, that was terrible.

3004
04:06:29,510 --> 04:06:31,190
350 damage.

3005
04:06:31,190 --> 04:06:34,030
Oh yeah, Bowser is scaring the monsters.

3006
04:06:38,920 --> 04:06:53,200
It's Bowser, run!

3007
04:06:53,200 --> 04:07:04,040
Cowards.

3008
04:07:04,040 --> 04:07:08,270
Bowser, one hit kill, let's see.

3009
04:07:08,270 --> 04:07:12,190
Oh, damn it, it's close.

3010
04:07:15,520 --> 04:07:17,799
You have more than 500 HP.

3011
04:07:17,799 --> 04:07:23,520
Do you?

3012
04:07:23,520 --> 04:08:13,319
Now Bowser's minions aren't very loyal, unfortunately.

3013
04:08:13,319 --> 04:08:14,280
How do you miss?

3014
04:08:28,399 --> 04:08:30,040
How do you punch a ghost?

3015
04:08:30,040 --> 04:08:32,729
You know what, you got me.

3016
04:08:32,729 --> 04:08:41,329
You got me, it's true.

3017
04:08:41,329 --> 04:08:42,250
What?

3018
04:08:42,250 --> 04:08:44,010
Oh, it's the other, it's the wrong one.

3019
04:08:44,010 --> 04:09:04,450
Wrong one, Jerry, wrong one.

3020
04:09:04,450 --> 04:09:17,340
Let's see, then get them all.

3021
04:09:17,340 --> 04:09:28,860
100 coins, whoa.

3022
04:09:28,860 --> 04:09:43,260
Again, no, that was so bad.

3023
04:09:43,260 --> 04:09:47,420
I can't even fucking believe it.

3024
04:09:47,420 --> 04:10:09,930
Is the FPS going up and down like crazy or something?

3025
04:10:09,930 --> 04:10:11,049
Well, that's an excuse.

3026
04:10:11,049 --> 04:10:15,590
Oh, it absolutely is.

3027
04:10:15,590 --> 04:10:18,229
I'm trying to make up excuses as to why

3028
04:10:18,229 --> 04:10:23,969
I can't get that frame.

3029
04:10:23,969 --> 04:10:24,809
Why did I get this game?

3030
04:10:24,809 --> 04:10:25,729
Because this is one of the top five

3031
04:10:25,729 --> 04:10:29,399
best games ever created.

3032
04:10:29,399 --> 04:10:31,719
You know, changed my mind.

3033
04:10:31,719 --> 04:10:50,079
Not gonna happen.

3034
04:10:50,079 --> 04:10:52,670
What are the other four?

3035
04:10:52,670 --> 04:10:57,889
Maybe I'll tell you one day.

3036
04:10:57,889 --> 04:11:05,409
Diablo 2, Mario RPG, Team Fortress 2,

3037
04:11:05,409 --> 04:11:23,239
Chrono Trigger, and The Neverhood.

3038
04:11:23,239 --> 04:11:25,760
And if you really want to, bump off The Neverhood,

3039
04:11:25,760 --> 04:11:28,979
put in Bloodborne.

3040
04:11:28,979 --> 04:11:42,250
It's probably more accurate at this stage.

3041
04:11:42,250 --> 04:11:44,690
Bloodborne, yeah, but I truly believe

3042
04:11:44,690 --> 04:11:49,610
that Bloodborne is one of the best video games ever made.

3043
04:11:49,610 --> 04:12:00,030
I truly believe that, I do.

3044
04:12:00,030 --> 04:12:06,469
Now, if only they made it run at 60 FPS

3045
04:12:06,469 --> 04:12:08,790
and put it everywhere else, then I

3046
04:12:08,790 --> 04:12:22,469
think it would probably take that cake.

3047
04:12:22,469 --> 04:12:42,709
I would even take a PS4 Pro patch.

3048
04:12:42,709 --> 04:12:44,860
What about Super Frog?

3049
04:12:44,860 --> 04:13:01,090
Well, Super Frog, no, I'm not gonna go there.

3050
04:13:01,090 --> 04:13:13,569
It's the best game that could come out of a cereal box.

3051
04:13:13,569 --> 04:13:14,889
No, he's not voting anymore.

3052
04:13:14,889 --> 04:13:33,600
No, we're past, we're beyond the voting stage.

3053
04:13:33,600 --> 04:13:43,450
Yeah, I got them all.

3054
04:13:43,450 --> 04:13:47,360
Star Beep.

3055
04:13:47,360 --> 04:14:14,920
Isn't that an emote?

3056
04:14:14,920 --> 04:14:16,879
The final fight incoming.

3057
04:14:16,879 --> 04:14:21,540
It's against, no, is there another one of these?

3058
04:14:21,540 --> 04:14:23,139
No, there isn't, right?

3059
04:14:23,139 --> 04:14:26,200
I don't think there is.

3060
04:14:26,200 --> 04:14:32,000
Are there three?

3061
04:14:32,000 --> 04:14:34,079
Oh, that sucks, I hate that.

3062
04:14:34,079 --> 04:14:41,940
Now I have to do it again.

3063
04:14:41,940 --> 04:14:48,389
Oh, finally.

3064
04:14:48,389 --> 04:14:50,639
Is there another door?

3065
04:14:50,639 --> 04:14:52,290
No, it's not.

3066
04:14:52,290 --> 04:14:55,659
Star Gun, hey.

3067
04:14:55,659 --> 04:14:59,430
Look what I found.

3068
04:14:59,430 --> 04:15:03,840
That is Gino's best weapon, the Star Gun.

3069
04:15:07,280 --> 04:15:11,559
It goes do, do, do, do, do, do, do.

3070
04:15:11,559 --> 04:15:13,579
Exactly like that.

3071
04:15:13,579 --> 04:15:15,579
All right, there's only one more I have to do.

3072
04:15:15,579 --> 04:15:16,760
You don't have very many choices.

3073
04:15:16,760 --> 04:15:20,719
You have one, three, or six.

3074
04:15:20,719 --> 04:15:23,000
You should be able to click these really fucking easily

3075
04:15:23,000 --> 04:15:24,040
because they're so spread out.

3076
04:15:24,040 --> 04:15:47,819
Don't want any excuses for this one.

3077
04:15:47,819 --> 04:15:56,389
Looks like all the way at the end.

3078
04:15:56,389 --> 04:15:59,899
32%.

3079
04:15:59,899 --> 04:16:08,389
Okay, number six.

3080
04:16:08,389 --> 04:16:13,059
Get, got 10 tries.

3081
04:16:13,059 --> 04:16:24,540
Oh, there goes one.

3082
04:16:24,540 --> 04:16:30,540
Oh no, and I'm losing money for these too?

3083
04:16:30,540 --> 04:16:35,260
Ah, the jump is so far.

3084
04:16:35,260 --> 04:16:51,389
Oh no, holy shit, man.

3085
04:16:51,389 --> 04:16:53,989
The thing is, there's only one distance you can jump.

3086
04:16:53,989 --> 04:16:58,959
Okay, no, okay, I got plenty of coins.

3087
04:16:58,959 --> 04:17:08,899
Five chances.

3088
04:17:08,899 --> 04:17:13,450
It's all fucking reversed.

3089
04:17:13,450 --> 04:17:14,489
Pick me up.

3090
04:17:14,489 --> 04:17:19,559
Throw it away.

3091
04:17:19,559 --> 04:17:20,719
Am I gonna get camped?

3092
04:17:32,129 --> 04:17:33,530
Flower tab.

3093
04:17:33,530 --> 04:17:45,659
All right, I gotta bring these guys back here.

3094
04:17:45,659 --> 04:17:49,139
Oh, you stupid idiot, come on, what?

3095
04:17:49,139 --> 04:18:01,170
Oh, that's bullshit.

3096
04:18:01,170 --> 04:18:02,290
What is this?

3097
04:18:02,290 --> 04:18:07,899
Max mushroom, get rid of the mid mushroom.

3098
04:18:07,899 --> 04:18:12,180
Oh, what is that?

3099
04:18:12,180 --> 04:18:13,739
Rock candy.

3100
04:18:13,739 --> 04:18:20,459
Getting rid of a mid mushroom.

3101
04:18:20,459 --> 04:18:23,100
I'm definitely at 99, 999, 99 coins, right?

3102
04:18:23,100 --> 04:18:25,500
Yeah, don't even pick, why would I pick up the coins?

3103
04:18:25,500 --> 04:18:28,399
What's the frog coin?

3104
04:18:28,399 --> 04:18:29,319
Only frog coins.

3105
04:18:34,229 --> 04:18:38,670
Five chances.

3106
04:18:38,670 --> 04:18:58,209
Secret.

3107
04:18:58,209 --> 04:19:00,170
You missed a secret back in Ancestors.

3108
04:19:03,350 --> 04:19:04,190
Nice.

3109
04:19:07,420 --> 04:19:12,809
I gotta be a completionist, okay, I got it.

3110
04:19:12,809 --> 04:19:15,850
All right, try not to mess this up.

3111
04:19:15,850 --> 04:19:21,100
I have five attempts.

3112
04:19:21,100 --> 04:19:22,540
Oh, that one's just missed it.

3113
04:19:22,540 --> 04:19:23,780
Oh, okay, I gotta be careful,

3114
04:19:23,780 --> 04:19:46,030
because god damn it, I knew that was gonna happen.

3115
04:19:46,030 --> 04:19:59,030
All right, now the flower tab, good.

3116
04:19:59,030 --> 04:20:03,299
All right, this is gonna be tricky.

3117
04:20:03,299 --> 04:20:04,139
What's this?

3118
04:20:04,139 --> 04:20:04,979
Royal syrup?

3119
04:20:04,979 --> 04:20:06,780
Just get rid of a maple syrup.

3120
04:20:06,780 --> 04:20:08,420
No, get rid of a mushroom.

3121
04:20:27,940 --> 04:20:29,260
Oh, fuck, I hit my head,

3122
04:20:29,260 --> 04:20:33,219
and I'm gonna fall all the way down.

3123
04:20:40,760 --> 04:20:52,010
It's okay, I gotta get it.

3124
04:20:52,010 --> 04:20:55,889
It could be something cool.

3125
04:20:55,889 --> 04:21:03,690
Oh my god, fuck you, stupid platforming bullshit.

3126
04:21:03,850 --> 04:21:33,959
Oh, okay, what is this?

3127
04:21:33,959 --> 04:21:36,450
Ooh, good, get rid of pure water.

3128
04:21:36,450 --> 04:21:41,569
These things are worthless.

3129
04:21:41,569 --> 04:21:43,610
Sonic symbol.

3130
04:21:43,610 --> 04:21:48,889
That is Mallow's greatest weapon.

3131
04:21:48,889 --> 04:21:49,770
Sticky glove.

3132
04:21:49,770 --> 04:21:59,139
Sonic symbol, nice.

3133
04:21:59,139 --> 04:22:03,309
It's time to go.

3134
04:22:03,309 --> 04:22:07,709
Save point, nice.

3135
04:22:12,840 --> 04:22:14,799
Mallow in.

3136
04:22:14,799 --> 04:22:23,989
All right, Mallow in.

3137
04:22:23,989 --> 04:22:26,489
Mallow in, Gino in.

3138
04:22:26,489 --> 04:22:36,260
Nope, he's fire pants on.

3139
04:22:47,920 --> 04:22:49,280
Give him the lazy shell.

3140
04:23:00,909 --> 04:23:14,500
I'll give it a try.

3141
04:23:14,500 --> 04:23:18,079
This is Smithy's castle.

3142
04:23:18,079 --> 04:23:51,299
No trespassers allowed.

3143
04:23:51,340 --> 04:23:52,700
That was so much damage.

3144
04:23:53,870 --> 04:24:14,409
I wanna see if this does.

3145
04:24:14,409 --> 04:24:16,530
I can jump more times with the star

3146
04:24:16,530 --> 04:24:23,139
than I came with Mario.

3147
04:24:23,139 --> 04:24:25,190
He's dead, stop.

3148
04:24:25,190 --> 04:24:40,559
He's violent.

3149
04:24:40,559 --> 04:24:45,510
That's my child?

3150
04:24:45,510 --> 04:24:55,469
My child?

3151
04:24:55,469 --> 04:24:59,989
Uh-oh, he brought a jinx.

3152
04:24:59,989 --> 04:25:12,299
Wait, jinx is supposed to be on our team.

3153
04:25:12,299 --> 04:25:23,299
That's okay, he's gone.

3154
04:25:23,299 --> 04:25:36,639
Come on in, 40.

3155
04:25:36,639 --> 04:25:40,739
One more hit, that should be it.

3156
04:25:40,739 --> 04:25:45,079
Let's see.

3157
04:25:45,079 --> 04:25:56,139
Kamek, raised Bowser.

3158
04:25:56,139 --> 04:26:00,100
Hmm, that's, that's meh.

3159
04:26:00,100 --> 04:26:02,530
Bajie Koopa.

3160
04:26:02,569 --> 04:26:03,850
Huh, where am I?

3161
04:26:04,899 --> 04:26:06,780
Bowser, hello.

3162
04:26:06,780 --> 04:26:08,459
How have you been?

3163
04:26:08,459 --> 04:26:11,659
I made it back here somehow,

3164
04:26:11,659 --> 04:26:15,040
but it seems like I've been brainwashed or something.

3165
04:26:15,040 --> 04:26:17,440
I can't seem to remember anything.

3166
04:26:17,440 --> 04:26:20,659
Have I done something wrong?

3167
04:26:20,659 --> 04:26:23,620
Ugh, don't worry about it.

3168
04:26:23,620 --> 04:26:25,659
Let's just put it behind us.

3169
04:26:25,659 --> 04:26:29,799
It's great running into loyal Koopa Troopa like you.

3170
04:26:29,799 --> 04:26:30,639
Oh, I'm glad.

3171
04:26:30,639 --> 04:26:35,620
It looks like you've got some tough new troopers now,

3172
04:26:35,620 --> 04:26:39,299
but my magic can still help you.

3173
04:26:39,299 --> 04:26:40,139
What's this?

3174
04:26:48,829 --> 04:26:52,510
This magic treasure books will never run out of coins.

3175
04:26:52,510 --> 04:26:54,959
Just keep on hitting it.

3176
04:26:54,959 --> 04:26:57,079
I'll be here if you need me.

3177
04:26:57,079 --> 04:27:02,159
Come by whenever you need to rejuvenate your HP and magic.

3178
04:27:02,159 --> 04:27:03,000
What?

3179
04:27:06,020 --> 04:27:08,420
Guys, you'll never know what I found.

3180
04:27:41,770 --> 04:27:43,170
You still hanging around?

3181
04:27:43,170 --> 04:27:45,090
Oh, you want more items, huh?

3182
04:27:45,090 --> 04:27:47,129
Seems I'm in a good mood.

3183
04:27:47,129 --> 04:27:49,809
Just remember, I can't always be coming to your rescue,

3184
04:27:49,809 --> 04:27:50,770
you know.

3185
04:27:50,770 --> 04:27:57,079
If there's anything more you need, best to buy it now.

3186
04:27:57,079 --> 04:28:00,399
Well, you certainly have hero shirt, prince pants,

3187
04:28:00,399 --> 04:28:11,840
star cape, heel shell, royal dress, get it all.

3188
04:28:11,840 --> 04:28:15,430
Hero shirt, bang.

3189
04:28:15,430 --> 04:28:19,420
Prince pants, thank you.

3190
04:28:19,420 --> 04:28:35,510
Heel shell, star cape, royal dress, lazy shell.

3191
04:28:39,590 --> 04:29:20,180
It's time, no it's not, it's time.

3192
04:29:20,180 --> 04:29:22,020
You wanna see how crazy this thing is?

3193
04:29:23,629 --> 04:29:43,940
Well, you'll see.

3194
04:29:43,940 --> 04:29:46,459
We're gonna go with the original three.

3195
04:29:53,500 --> 04:29:56,670
What I got for items?

3196
04:29:56,670 --> 04:29:59,469
Froggy drink, royal syrup, royal syrup, max mushroom,

3197
04:29:59,469 --> 04:30:02,190
max, max, max, I need some more syrups.

3198
04:30:02,190 --> 04:30:04,469
I'm getting rid of the braces and the energizer.

3199
04:30:04,469 --> 04:30:25,409
And like the pure water and all that crap.

3200
04:30:25,409 --> 04:30:28,569
I'm gonna keep this, use it on Culex.

3201
04:30:28,569 --> 04:30:31,770
All right, let's get some more royal syrups

3202
04:30:31,770 --> 04:30:33,129
or more maple syrups.

3203
04:30:34,250 --> 04:30:37,430
That's good.

3204
04:30:37,469 --> 04:30:42,690
In fact, I need, I'm probably,

3205
04:30:42,690 --> 04:30:43,969
I need the syrups more than I need.

3206
04:30:43,969 --> 04:30:45,809
You gotta use Yoshi at some point too.

3207
04:30:53,469 --> 04:31:04,540
Yeah, FP is way more important to me.

3208
04:31:04,540 --> 04:31:26,180
This is the part of the story where Krakos says, see ya.

3209
04:31:26,180 --> 04:31:33,459
Fill me up.

3210
04:31:33,459 --> 04:31:50,750
Wait, where's the save point?

3211
04:31:50,750 --> 04:31:53,860
I can always, I got plenty of money.

3212
04:31:53,860 --> 04:32:02,840
I don't need money for anything anymore.

3213
04:32:02,840 --> 04:32:10,579
Oops, there's the lazy shell.

3214
04:32:10,579 --> 04:32:33,000
It's just one of those big chunky guys.

3215
04:32:33,000 --> 04:32:34,079
Gino level 20.

3216
04:32:37,719 --> 04:32:42,299
I'm gonna go.

3217
04:32:42,299 --> 04:32:43,219
That's right.

3218
04:32:43,219 --> 04:32:49,610
I've selected.

3219
04:32:49,610 --> 04:33:07,310
Thank you.

3220
04:33:07,310 --> 04:33:09,159
Here we go.

3221
04:33:09,159 --> 04:33:10,180
It's time.

3222
04:33:10,180 --> 04:33:14,250
We're in Bowser's castle in the throne room.

3223
04:33:14,250 --> 04:33:25,639
Ah, so you are the notorious Mario.

3224
04:33:25,639 --> 04:33:27,919
I have impressed you made it this far.

3225
04:33:27,919 --> 04:33:31,819
I didn't think you could.

3226
04:33:31,819 --> 04:33:35,970
Oh, feisty little fellow, aren't we?

3227
04:33:35,970 --> 04:33:38,450
But this is the end of the line.

3228
04:33:38,450 --> 04:33:49,819
Now you've got to deal with me and God.

3229
04:33:49,819 --> 04:33:51,740
This lazy shell, this motherfucker.

3230
04:33:51,740 --> 04:34:04,919
Boomer.

3231
04:34:04,919 --> 04:34:05,759
Oh, what's that?

3232
04:34:05,759 --> 04:34:08,529
You can't even hurt me.

3233
04:34:08,529 --> 04:34:10,290
I am unstoppable.

3234
04:34:10,290 --> 04:34:19,220
Although I can't hurt you either.

3235
04:34:19,220 --> 04:34:20,979
Is this the final boss?

3236
04:34:20,979 --> 04:34:21,979
You guessed it.

3237
04:34:21,979 --> 04:34:29,240
This is the final encounter of the game.

3238
04:34:29,240 --> 04:34:44,389
This is the dastardly villain known as Smithy.

3239
04:34:44,389 --> 04:34:45,650
No, the one person.

3240
04:34:45,650 --> 04:34:46,470
Okay, good.

3241
04:34:46,470 --> 04:34:50,560
That's fine.

3242
04:34:50,560 --> 04:34:55,360
Just do the group heal.

3243
04:34:55,360 --> 04:34:56,220
Oh shit, that's right.

3244
04:34:56,220 --> 04:34:57,779
Her magic is terrible now

3245
04:34:57,779 --> 04:35:02,029
because I put the lazy shell on her.

3246
04:35:02,029 --> 04:35:02,950
Forgot about that.

3247
04:35:20,029 --> 04:35:21,509
Let's do an ultra flame.

3248
04:35:21,509 --> 04:35:39,849
Now that you're blue, might as well.

3249
04:35:39,849 --> 04:35:42,459
You're blue now.

3250
04:35:42,459 --> 04:35:47,040
Oh, another group up.

3251
04:35:47,040 --> 04:35:51,380
69.

3252
04:35:51,380 --> 04:35:52,819
That's so much damage.

3253
04:35:54,619 --> 04:35:55,740
Nice miss.

3254
04:36:05,630 --> 04:36:08,060
This is absurd.

3255
04:36:08,060 --> 04:36:11,060
I can't be defeated by them.

3256
04:36:11,060 --> 04:36:13,610
I won't let this happen.

3257
04:36:13,610 --> 04:36:16,319
I will not fall in battle.

3258
04:36:16,319 --> 04:36:22,099
Oh, having an attack.

3259
04:36:22,099 --> 04:36:27,849
Oh, I don't need your sympathy.

3260
04:36:27,849 --> 04:36:29,689
I am a soldier.

3261
04:36:29,689 --> 04:36:33,450
I am prepared to go.

3262
04:36:33,490 --> 04:36:35,049
Take a dive, Chandelier.

3263
04:36:39,849 --> 04:36:46,880
See you later, kids.

3264
04:36:46,880 --> 04:36:49,310
Builder.

3265
04:36:49,310 --> 04:36:52,099
Oh, poor Builder.

3266
04:36:52,099 --> 04:36:54,139
But not to worry.

3267
04:36:54,139 --> 04:37:01,979
A little fall isn't gonna hurt you.

3268
04:37:01,979 --> 04:37:03,700
All right, Mario.

3269
04:37:03,700 --> 04:37:05,860
I'll lead you to the top.

3270
04:37:05,860 --> 04:37:09,909
We must hurry to the appointed place.

3271
04:37:09,909 --> 04:37:12,439
Hang on tight.

3272
04:37:12,439 --> 04:37:17,810
And away we go.

3273
04:37:29,139 --> 04:37:30,680
Increasing speed.

3274
04:37:43,869 --> 04:37:47,250
Next up, the top floor.

3275
04:37:47,250 --> 04:37:48,770
Please fasten your seatbelts.

3276
04:37:48,770 --> 04:37:51,220
And wait a second.

3277
04:37:51,220 --> 04:37:52,700
There are no seatbelts.

3278
04:37:54,819 --> 04:37:55,659
I killed them.

3279
04:37:55,659 --> 04:37:57,700
I killed all three of them.

3280
04:37:57,700 --> 04:37:58,540
Why didn't they trust me?

3281
04:37:58,540 --> 04:37:59,380
I'm a bad guy.

3282
04:37:59,380 --> 04:38:00,860
I've been in the castle for fucking the last six months

3283
04:38:00,860 --> 04:38:09,240
as a bad person.

3284
04:38:09,240 --> 04:38:10,080
Let's go.

3285
04:38:10,080 --> 04:38:10,919
Let's go.

3286
04:38:10,919 --> 04:38:11,740
Let's go.

3287
04:38:11,740 --> 04:38:12,580
Let's go.

3288
04:38:12,580 --> 04:38:13,400
Let's go.

3289
04:38:13,400 --> 04:38:18,060
Let's go.

3290
04:38:18,060 --> 04:38:39,849
The eye is protecting XOR.

3291
04:38:39,849 --> 04:38:42,009
One.

3292
04:38:42,009 --> 04:38:44,209
They're all so overpowered right now.

3293
04:38:44,209 --> 04:38:49,340
I have all the best items in the game.

3294
04:38:49,340 --> 04:38:50,180
Well, except for that.

3295
04:38:50,180 --> 04:38:51,020
That was painful.

3296
04:38:51,020 --> 04:38:52,020
That was very painful.

3297
04:39:05,130 --> 04:39:05,970
Yes.

3298
04:39:05,970 --> 04:39:08,610
This is the meme boss.

3299
04:39:08,610 --> 04:39:10,490
And by meme boss, I mean,

3300
04:39:10,490 --> 04:39:13,330
this is the boss that you can kill in less than five seconds.

3301
04:39:15,840 --> 04:39:20,459
Gino can kill this boss in less than a second.

3302
04:39:20,459 --> 04:39:21,299
I just figured we would,

3303
04:39:21,299 --> 04:39:22,419
I don't, you wanna see how,

3304
04:39:22,419 --> 04:39:29,360
I wanna play this way.

3305
04:39:29,360 --> 04:39:36,400
XOR's protection is gone.

3306
04:39:36,439 --> 04:39:37,279
Yes.

3307
04:39:37,279 --> 04:39:40,080
You can do 9,999 damage to this boss with Gino.

3308
04:39:40,959 --> 04:39:42,200
And everybody knows that.

3309
04:39:42,200 --> 04:39:44,500
So, I mean, it's like, that's like a thing.

3310
04:39:45,639 --> 04:39:49,479
That's like in every top 10, did you know gaming lists.

3311
04:39:49,479 --> 04:39:53,759
It's like number six on every single one of them.

3312
04:39:53,759 --> 04:39:55,439
So, I mean, are you really that shocked?

3313
04:39:55,439 --> 04:40:16,580
Do you need to see it?

3314
04:40:16,580 --> 04:40:20,439
Damn.

3315
04:40:20,439 --> 04:40:22,669
That's slow down.

3316
04:40:22,669 --> 04:40:31,119
I gotta get rid of the mouth.

3317
04:40:31,119 --> 04:40:31,959
All right.

3318
04:40:31,959 --> 04:40:33,169
That's bad.

3319
04:40:33,169 --> 04:40:34,430
First bad thing that happened.

3320
04:40:34,669 --> 04:40:38,150
I mean, you're gonna come back with like 20 health.

3321
04:40:56,459 --> 04:41:05,090
Let's do one of Bowser's fun moves.

3322
04:41:05,090 --> 04:41:07,319
The crusher.

3323
04:41:07,319 --> 04:41:08,560
Oh, that hurts.

3324
04:41:08,560 --> 04:41:09,560
Let's do a group hug.

3325
04:41:16,159 --> 04:41:19,180
Knock out the, don't, knock the mouth out.

3326
04:41:19,180 --> 04:41:20,020
Mouth is annoying.

3327
04:41:20,020 --> 04:41:20,840
It does too many moves.

3328
04:41:20,840 --> 04:41:22,180
There we go.

3329
04:41:22,180 --> 04:41:23,939
You know what, take out the other eye too.

3330
04:41:43,409 --> 04:41:44,250
Other eye, come on.

3331
04:41:44,250 --> 04:41:46,009
I want the whole thing down.

3332
04:41:46,009 --> 04:42:02,869
I wanna shut down his whole computer.

3333
04:42:02,869 --> 04:42:12,869
Come on, shut off his whole computer.

3334
04:42:12,869 --> 04:42:27,810
You don't stand a chance to me with my best items in the game.

3335
04:42:27,810 --> 04:42:33,360
Oh no.

3336
04:42:33,360 --> 04:42:34,560
Everyone's fine.

3337
04:42:34,560 --> 04:42:35,400
Go for the eye.

3338
04:42:35,400 --> 04:42:38,659
Go for the X-Or.

3339
04:42:38,659 --> 04:42:39,580
Use Yoshi?

3340
04:42:39,580 --> 04:42:40,419
All right.

3341
04:42:40,419 --> 04:42:41,240
No.

3342
04:42:41,240 --> 04:42:43,659
Let's use Yoshi for the real fight.

3343
04:42:43,659 --> 04:42:44,869
You know what I mean?

3344
04:42:44,869 --> 04:42:49,750
I'm gonna use, I'm gonna use everything on Kuwait.

3345
04:42:49,750 --> 04:42:53,909
I'm gonna use Yoshi now.

3346
04:42:53,909 --> 04:42:54,750
Real fight.

3347
04:42:54,750 --> 04:42:56,430
Oh shit, I forgot that you guys don't know

3348
04:42:56,430 --> 04:43:00,229
you haven't played this game.

3349
04:43:00,229 --> 04:43:01,069
I'm sorry.

3350
04:43:01,069 --> 04:43:03,270
I just, shit.

3351
04:43:03,310 --> 04:43:04,549
Oh shit.

3352
04:43:04,549 --> 04:43:06,270
Oh no.

3353
04:43:06,270 --> 04:43:20,200
Guys, there's like two more hours in this game.

3354
04:43:20,200 --> 04:43:21,279
Uh-oh, gunk ball.

3355
04:43:35,709 --> 04:43:36,549
Is everybody alive?

3356
04:43:36,549 --> 04:43:37,389
Everybody's fine.

3357
04:43:42,619 --> 04:43:43,939
All right, do you want me to reload the save

3358
04:43:43,939 --> 04:43:58,090
and kill this boss in one hit?

3359
04:43:58,090 --> 04:43:58,930
Sure, why not?

3360
04:43:59,889 --> 04:44:10,939
Yeah, that'd be cool.

3361
04:44:10,939 --> 04:44:12,419
So, the Gino Whirl timing is like,

3362
04:44:12,419 --> 04:44:14,459
I think right when it comes out of his hand, right?

3363
04:44:14,459 --> 04:44:18,099
It's like right when the disc comes out of your fingers.

3364
04:44:18,099 --> 04:44:19,779
You have to go through boomer and cut scenes again.

3365
04:44:19,779 --> 04:44:23,990
Yeah, that's true.

3366
04:44:23,990 --> 04:44:27,009
There's a weird timing on it.

3367
04:44:27,009 --> 04:44:45,779
It's as it leaves the screen.

3368
04:44:45,779 --> 04:44:48,659
So, it's right when it goes boop.

3369
04:44:48,659 --> 04:44:49,659
Right when it leaves.

3370
04:44:57,139 --> 04:44:57,979
Don't reset?

3371
04:44:57,979 --> 04:44:58,819
I won't.

3372
04:45:00,509 --> 04:45:03,310
Once I finish the, once I finish everything I wanna do,

3373
04:45:03,310 --> 04:45:05,349
maybe I'll, next save that I do

3374
04:45:05,349 --> 04:45:07,029
is gonna be a different slot.

3375
04:45:07,029 --> 04:45:08,110
And maybe before I end the stream,

3376
04:45:08,110 --> 04:45:10,840
we'll just go try and do it.

3377
04:45:10,840 --> 04:45:19,419
You know, it'll be one of those after things that we do.

3378
04:45:19,419 --> 04:45:23,439
There we go.

3379
04:45:23,439 --> 04:45:25,720
I think we're getting to the end of this boss.

3380
04:45:29,200 --> 04:45:30,040
Yep.

3381
04:45:44,470 --> 04:45:46,099
Sucked up.

3382
04:45:46,099 --> 04:45:53,099
Teach level 20.

3383
04:45:53,099 --> 04:45:53,939
Swap.

3384
04:46:04,500 --> 04:46:07,779
Do you know where this leads to?

3385
04:46:07,779 --> 04:46:11,740
It looks like Exor is the contact between the two worlds.

3386
04:46:11,740 --> 04:46:17,819
In other words, if we follow this road, we'll find Smithy.

3387
04:46:17,819 --> 04:46:19,840
So, what's keeping us?

3388
04:46:19,840 --> 04:46:21,750
Hang on.

3389
04:46:21,750 --> 04:46:25,150
Hey, I only joined so that I could get my castle back.

3390
04:46:25,150 --> 04:46:28,599
I'm not gonna be dragged along on this stupid hunt.

3391
04:46:28,599 --> 04:46:31,060
This is as far as I go.

3392
04:46:31,060 --> 04:46:34,540
I'm gonna gather my troops and rebuild my castle.

3393
04:46:34,580 --> 04:46:38,779
And you, Mario, you're an official member of the Koopa Troop.

3394
04:46:38,779 --> 04:46:40,860
It's your duty to help with the repairs.

3395
04:46:42,549 --> 04:46:44,830
Bowser, you're completely missing the point.

3396
04:46:47,509 --> 04:46:50,569
I ought to rip your stuffin' out.

3397
04:46:50,569 --> 04:46:52,490
No, think about it, Bowser.

3398
04:46:52,490 --> 04:46:55,630
This sword connects the two worlds, right?

3399
04:46:55,630 --> 04:46:57,619
Yeah, so?

3400
04:46:57,619 --> 04:47:00,240
Even if we defeat Exor,

3401
04:47:00,240 --> 04:47:03,909
there will be other weapon beasts to follow him.

3402
04:47:03,909 --> 04:47:07,389
Your castle is at your entrance point to your world.

3403
04:47:07,389 --> 04:47:10,799
In short, they'll be back.

3404
04:47:10,799 --> 04:47:13,099
Is that what you want?

3405
04:47:13,099 --> 04:47:19,069
Uh, well, eh.

3406
04:47:19,069 --> 04:47:22,029
More weapon things comin' to take over my castle.

3407
04:47:22,029 --> 04:47:24,970
What about my privacy?

3408
04:47:24,970 --> 04:47:26,450
Yikes.

3409
04:47:26,450 --> 04:47:27,409
This isn't good at all.

3410
04:47:27,409 --> 04:47:30,000
In fact, this stinks.

3411
04:47:30,000 --> 04:47:32,880
But I can't just be pals with these cretins.

3412
04:47:32,880 --> 04:47:35,360
I've got an image to keep up.

3413
04:47:35,360 --> 04:47:39,479
Uh, I got it.

3414
04:47:39,479 --> 04:47:42,319
No one insults the Koopa Troop and gets away with it.

3415
04:47:42,319 --> 04:47:45,619
I've got a bone to pick with this Smithy guy.

3416
04:47:45,619 --> 04:47:49,169
Come on, Mario, we'll teach you a lesson.

3417
04:47:49,169 --> 04:47:52,180
Bowser needs Nord?

3418
04:47:52,180 --> 04:47:54,990
I'm so sly.

3419
04:47:54,990 --> 04:47:58,360
It looks like we're together on this one.

3420
04:47:58,360 --> 04:48:26,319
Let's-a-go.

3421
04:48:26,319 --> 04:48:27,599
VPN.

3422
04:48:27,599 --> 04:48:31,790
Oh!

3423
04:48:31,790 --> 04:48:42,509
No!

3424
04:48:42,509 --> 04:48:48,700
Let's see.

3425
04:48:48,700 --> 04:48:49,700
Good thing I have this save,

3426
04:48:49,700 --> 04:49:03,490
so we can go from here all the way back to where we were.

3427
04:49:03,490 --> 04:49:05,090
ZL, ZR?

3428
04:49:05,090 --> 04:49:07,919
What do you mean, ZL, ZR?

3429
04:49:07,919 --> 04:49:13,860
ZL, ZR?

3430
04:49:13,860 --> 04:49:15,220
Rewind, you're on the classic.

3431
04:49:15,220 --> 04:49:16,380
What do you mean, rewind?

3432
04:49:16,380 --> 04:49:17,220
I can't rewind.

3433
04:49:17,220 --> 04:49:18,459
I didn't mean rewind on the classic.

3434
04:49:18,459 --> 04:49:21,970
How do I do that?

3435
04:49:21,970 --> 04:49:25,299
Can I rewind on the classic?

3436
04:49:25,299 --> 04:49:26,979
Hold Z...

3437
04:49:26,979 --> 04:49:30,229
I don't have ZL, ZR.

3438
04:49:30,229 --> 04:49:39,060
Hit reset.

3439
04:49:39,060 --> 04:49:46,349
What's that?

3440
04:49:46,349 --> 04:49:49,009
Save?

3441
04:49:49,009 --> 04:49:50,169
Stop, stop, stop.

3442
04:49:50,169 --> 04:49:56,299
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

3443
04:49:56,299 --> 04:49:58,139
Hit X.

3444
04:49:58,139 --> 04:49:59,220
Rewind?

3445
04:49:59,220 --> 04:50:00,060
How far...

3446
04:50:00,060 --> 04:50:01,919
Wait, is this for real?

3447
04:50:01,919 --> 04:50:04,240
I'm scared.

3448
04:50:04,240 --> 04:50:12,500
What does that mean?

3449
04:50:12,500 --> 04:50:13,580
Don't listen to one fuck...

3450
04:50:13,580 --> 04:50:19,060
If I hit X, what happens?

3451
04:50:19,060 --> 04:50:20,970
Don't.

3452
04:50:20,970 --> 04:50:23,490
Hit Y, make a save state, just in case.

3453
04:50:23,490 --> 04:50:24,979
Okay.

3454
04:50:24,979 --> 04:50:25,979
Now, let's rewind.

3455
04:50:27,569 --> 04:50:28,970
Is this gonna be fucking bad?

3456
04:50:33,659 --> 04:50:36,340
What the hell is happening?

3457
04:50:36,340 --> 04:50:38,450
What is going on?

3458
04:50:38,450 --> 04:50:44,659
What?

3459
04:50:44,659 --> 04:50:52,909
What the fuck?

3460
04:50:52,909 --> 04:50:53,750
All right, wait, wait, wait.

3461
04:50:53,750 --> 04:50:56,290
Okay, I'm gonna come in.

3462
04:50:56,290 --> 04:50:57,130
Here, this...

3463
04:50:57,130 --> 04:50:58,569
I'm gonna come in right here.

3464
04:50:58,569 --> 04:51:01,729
Right...

3465
04:51:01,729 --> 04:51:02,889
You can actually time travel in it.

3466
04:51:02,889 --> 04:51:06,540
It records the whole thing.

3467
04:51:06,540 --> 04:51:09,139
I didn't know you could do this.

3468
04:51:09,139 --> 04:51:14,110
All right, so come in right now.

3469
04:51:14,110 --> 04:51:20,400
Wow.

3470
04:51:20,400 --> 04:51:23,049
What?

3471
04:51:23,369 --> 04:51:28,060
That's insane.

3472
04:51:28,060 --> 04:51:34,560
I didn't know you could do that.

3473
04:51:34,560 --> 04:51:38,939
That's so cool.

3474
04:51:38,939 --> 04:51:41,759
All right, here we are.

3475
04:51:41,759 --> 04:51:54,319
I'm good.

3476
04:51:54,319 --> 04:51:55,479
You created a time paradox.

3477
04:51:55,479 --> 04:51:58,029
No, I didn't.

3478
04:51:58,029 --> 04:52:01,909
I came back in the second I was about to create a save,

3479
04:52:01,909 --> 04:52:06,069
which therefore would have created a new timeline.

3480
04:52:06,069 --> 04:52:08,590
So I came in on the current timeline

3481
04:52:08,590 --> 04:52:11,229
and stopped right before a new timeline was created.

3482
04:52:11,229 --> 04:52:13,430
Therefore, I'm playing in that last timeline.

3483
04:52:15,279 --> 04:52:21,270
I made sure that I did that correct.

3484
04:52:21,310 --> 04:52:23,229
The other timeline is doomed.

3485
04:52:23,229 --> 04:52:26,119
And we don't care about that one.

3486
04:52:26,119 --> 04:52:42,049
We're not in that one.

3487
04:52:42,049 --> 04:52:42,889
The other...

3488
04:52:42,889 --> 04:52:45,939
You killed the other timeline.

3489
04:52:45,939 --> 04:52:47,139
No, that time...

3490
04:52:47,139 --> 04:52:48,900
That's scary.

3491
04:52:48,900 --> 04:52:49,819
I don't like that.

3492
04:52:53,200 --> 04:52:54,799
No, that timeline...

3493
04:52:54,799 --> 04:52:57,080
All right, so let me think about this for a second.

3494
04:52:57,080 --> 04:53:01,319
So we were walking, we were playing,

3495
04:53:01,319 --> 04:53:03,159
and then I needed to go back in time.

3496
04:53:03,159 --> 04:53:08,729
So I went back.

3497
04:53:08,729 --> 04:53:11,889
So the Mario that was walking forward...

3498
04:53:12,369 --> 04:53:13,209
I don't have a PhD.

3499
04:53:13,209 --> 04:53:14,290
I'm not gonna be able to do that.

3500
04:53:14,290 --> 04:53:20,419
I don't care.

3501
04:53:20,419 --> 04:53:21,459
Oh, those of you that are curious,

3502
04:53:21,459 --> 04:53:23,340
these little guys here give the most experience

3503
04:53:23,340 --> 04:53:24,180
in the whole game.

3504
04:53:24,180 --> 04:53:25,459
And there's a place where you can farm them

3505
04:53:25,459 --> 04:53:27,819
to get to like the fucking 300 million levels.

3506
04:53:43,310 --> 04:53:49,479
Odd.

3507
04:53:49,479 --> 04:53:54,479
Rewind every time you miss a jump out of a hundred.

3508
04:53:57,759 --> 04:53:59,959
You can't make me do that.

3509
04:53:59,959 --> 04:54:39,639
Oh my God.

3510
04:54:39,639 --> 04:54:44,819
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight,

3511
04:54:45,700 --> 04:54:49,380
nine, 10, 11, 12.

3512
04:54:49,380 --> 04:54:50,819
Fuck.

3513
04:54:50,819 --> 04:55:05,619
That's too hard to do that.

3514
04:55:05,619 --> 04:55:07,060
That's impossible to do that.

3515
04:55:07,060 --> 04:55:10,150
No way.

3516
04:55:10,150 --> 04:55:11,869
You're creating all bunch of doomed timelines.

3517
04:55:11,869 --> 04:55:12,750
Who gives a shit?

3518
04:55:14,130 --> 04:55:22,819
One, eight, 10, 11, 12.

3519
04:55:22,819 --> 04:55:23,659
It's...

3520
04:55:23,659 --> 04:55:24,479
No, no, no.

3521
04:55:24,479 --> 04:55:25,319
You fucking idiot.

3522
04:55:26,939 --> 04:55:29,880
I'm trying...

3523
04:55:29,919 --> 04:55:35,650
Who cares about all these other people?

3524
04:55:35,650 --> 04:55:40,500
Can I speed it up?

3525
04:55:40,500 --> 04:56:08,209
It's 12, so on 11, I have to come back.

3526
04:56:08,209 --> 04:56:09,369
It's gonna work.

3527
04:56:14,389 --> 04:56:15,790
This is a lot.

3528
04:56:15,790 --> 04:56:16,630
Oh, hold on.

3529
04:56:36,880 --> 04:56:39,840
I'm just, I'm connecting timelines.

3530
04:56:42,689 --> 04:56:53,849
Three, eight, 12, 13, 14, 15, 18, 19, 20, 22,

3531
04:56:54,290 --> 04:56:59,240
25, 26, 27, 28, 29.

3532
04:56:59,240 --> 04:57:00,080
I'm coming in.

3533
04:57:00,080 --> 04:57:00,919
What was that?

3534
04:57:00,919 --> 04:57:01,759
40?

3535
04:57:01,759 --> 04:57:02,599
40.

3536
04:57:02,599 --> 04:57:03,439
43 jumps.

3537
04:57:03,439 --> 04:57:27,069
All right, let's, I gotta count them.

3538
04:57:27,069 --> 04:57:49,880
For nine, 40, I'm coming in.

3539
04:57:49,880 --> 04:57:50,720
Shit, I lost.

3540
04:57:50,720 --> 04:58:08,810
I lost jumps.

3541
04:58:08,810 --> 04:58:09,650
Timer in the top, right?

3542
04:58:09,650 --> 04:58:31,069
I, yeah, but I did sit here for a second.

3543
04:58:31,069 --> 04:58:32,830
Just coming at five seconds.

3544
04:58:32,830 --> 04:58:33,669
Okay.

3545
04:58:47,750 --> 04:58:49,979
Okay.

3546
04:58:49,979 --> 04:58:55,669
Okay.

3547
04:58:55,669 --> 04:58:56,509
I don't know how many that was.

3548
04:58:56,509 --> 04:59:04,349
I don't know, we have to count, right?

3549
04:59:04,349 --> 04:59:05,189
I don't know.

3550
04:59:05,189 --> 04:59:20,740
That was, I don't know, we have to count, right?

3551
04:59:20,740 --> 04:59:21,580
What am I doing?

3552
04:59:21,580 --> 04:59:23,860
I gotta get, I have to do this.

3553
04:59:23,860 --> 04:59:26,259
I am this far into this?

3554
04:59:26,259 --> 05:00:04,279
It's the only way.

3555
05:00:04,279 --> 05:00:12,139
Me.

3556
05:00:12,139 --> 05:00:18,590
Why can't I just have, why do I have to,

3557
05:00:18,590 --> 05:00:20,750
that was 46?

3558
05:00:20,750 --> 05:00:26,310
Oh my God.

3559
05:00:26,310 --> 05:00:28,150
Just like go make a hamburger or something.

3560
05:00:28,150 --> 05:00:44,200
I just come back in five minutes.

3561
05:00:44,200 --> 05:00:45,479
Those of you that don't know what's going on,

3562
05:00:45,479 --> 05:00:47,080
if you do 100 of these in a row,

3563
05:00:47,080 --> 05:00:50,130
you get the best armor in the whole game.

3564
05:00:50,130 --> 05:00:56,639
It's like a secret.

3565
05:00:56,639 --> 05:00:58,159
Okay, I'm done, I'm done.

3566
05:00:58,159 --> 05:00:59,599
I can't, it's impossible.

3567
05:01:10,180 --> 05:01:14,380
You're gonna do this shit 100 times in a row.

3568
05:01:14,380 --> 05:01:16,979
Create a save state every jump.

3569
05:01:16,979 --> 05:01:22,200
Every time I, okay, wait, that's a good idea.

3570
05:01:22,200 --> 05:01:26,340
All right, I have to come in and then do what?

3571
05:01:26,340 --> 05:01:31,119
Come in and then hit save state the battle part.

3572
05:01:31,119 --> 05:01:35,970
Wait, okay, what if I save state right here?

3573
05:01:35,970 --> 05:01:42,779
Like I'm gonna hit start, save state.

3574
05:01:42,779 --> 05:01:45,459
Oh my God, oh my God.

3575
05:01:45,459 --> 05:01:49,060
I'm about to fucking rip the controller out of my hands.

3576
05:01:49,060 --> 05:01:53,180
I couldn't do it fast enough.

3577
05:01:53,180 --> 05:01:54,659
Save state the battle?

3578
05:01:54,659 --> 05:01:59,700
No, I can't do that.

3579
05:01:59,700 --> 05:02:16,659
Cause that loses all 46 of these jumps.

3580
05:02:16,659 --> 05:02:18,590
Just hold on.

3581
05:02:18,590 --> 05:02:44,400
I'm gonna try this.

3582
05:02:44,400 --> 05:02:49,900
Did it do it?

3583
05:02:49,900 --> 05:02:53,220
It didn't hold.

3584
05:02:53,220 --> 05:02:54,139
What happened?

3585
05:02:54,139 --> 05:02:54,979
What did I just do?

3586
05:02:54,979 --> 05:03:02,740
What just happened?

3587
05:03:02,740 --> 05:03:04,860
How do I unlock this?

3588
05:03:04,860 --> 05:03:10,139
What?

3589
05:03:10,139 --> 05:03:33,799
What the fuck is going on?

3590
05:03:33,799 --> 05:03:35,520
I lost 20 jumps.

3591
05:03:35,520 --> 05:03:51,479
No, I didn't.

3592
05:03:51,479 --> 05:03:54,319
I'm done, I'm done.

3593
05:03:54,319 --> 05:03:56,159
I save stated it right here

3594
05:03:56,159 --> 05:03:58,599
and I fucking fell off the motherfucker.

3595
05:03:58,599 --> 05:04:00,080
No, man, no.

3596
05:04:00,119 --> 05:04:03,119
Nope, nope, no.

3597
05:04:03,119 --> 05:04:08,200
That's it.

3598
05:04:08,200 --> 05:04:11,720
I'm fucking, I'm not doing that.

3599
05:04:11,720 --> 05:04:13,520
I don't care if I never see a hundred jumps.

3600
05:04:13,520 --> 05:04:19,700
That shit's not, it's fucking impossible.

3601
05:04:19,700 --> 05:04:21,540
A hundred frame perfect jumps.

3602
05:04:21,540 --> 05:04:23,939
No, uh-uh, I ain't doing it.

3603
05:04:23,939 --> 05:04:24,779
I've never done it.

3604
05:04:24,779 --> 05:04:25,779
I've never done it once in 15 years.

3605
05:04:25,779 --> 05:04:41,880
Ain't gonna do it.

3606
05:04:41,880 --> 05:04:46,450
Ah, here's the room by the way.

3607
05:04:46,450 --> 05:04:48,290
No, I can't, it's too,

3608
05:04:48,290 --> 05:04:59,740
that's too fucking hard to do that.

3609
05:04:59,740 --> 05:05:00,740
That's what you said about the fight.

3610
05:05:00,740 --> 05:05:02,819
Yeah, but the 5,000 points in the Game Boy game

3611
05:05:02,819 --> 05:05:05,729
wasn't coming down from the air,

3612
05:05:05,729 --> 05:05:07,369
loading into a save state.

3613
05:05:30,930 --> 05:05:37,180
There's Mario's best weapon.

3614
05:05:37,180 --> 05:05:38,380
Oh, I do have the lazy shell,

3615
05:05:38,380 --> 05:05:39,340
so I don't think it's gonna be,

3616
05:05:39,340 --> 05:05:42,360
I don't think it's gonna matter.

3617
05:05:42,360 --> 05:05:45,930
No, the ultra hammer.

3618
05:05:45,930 --> 05:05:52,150
The lazy shell is better.

3619
05:05:52,150 --> 05:05:54,150
Now, that's how everybody does that.

3620
05:05:55,310 --> 05:05:56,830
They open up their emulator

3621
05:05:56,830 --> 05:06:01,830
and they slow time down to like a 10th of 60 seconds.

3622
05:06:01,869 --> 05:06:06,869
And it's just do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.

3623
05:06:07,310 --> 05:06:08,150
And they can,

3624
05:06:08,150 --> 05:06:26,400
it's right when Mario's shoe touches the enemy.

3625
05:06:26,400 --> 05:06:27,840
It's Mario.

3626
05:06:27,840 --> 05:06:29,340
It's Mario.

3627
05:06:29,340 --> 05:06:31,340
How did he get in here?

3628
05:06:31,340 --> 05:06:46,139
We better do something.

3629
05:06:46,139 --> 05:06:48,599
Time is marching on.

3630
05:06:48,599 --> 05:06:55,150
Do, reboot.

3631
05:06:55,150 --> 05:07:10,310
It's three o'clock, time to recover.

3632
05:07:10,310 --> 05:07:17,290
Gotta take out the heads first.

3633
05:07:17,290 --> 05:07:29,340
Ah, everyone's good.

3634
05:07:29,340 --> 05:07:32,700
Oh, he's destroying every timeline.

3635
05:07:32,700 --> 05:07:33,540
Ha ha ha ha.

3636
05:07:38,040 --> 05:07:42,319
He's even destroying the clock that controls the time.

3637
05:07:42,319 --> 05:07:44,590
I know, I'm a sick fuck, aren't I?

3638
05:07:45,430 --> 05:08:00,060
Oh, does Bowser have any other moves?

3639
05:08:05,080 --> 05:08:07,099
Fear of roulette.

3640
05:08:07,099 --> 05:08:13,459
Oh, it's dinner time.

3641
05:08:13,459 --> 05:08:14,939
Don't forget the math puzzles.

3642
05:08:14,939 --> 05:08:16,419
What do you mean math puzzles?

3643
05:08:23,139 --> 05:08:32,509
Math puzzles?

3644
05:08:32,509 --> 05:08:33,430
Time to break.

3645
05:08:33,430 --> 05:08:44,060
All right, let's get Peach back.

3646
05:08:44,060 --> 05:08:45,060
Doesn't she have the lazy shell?

3647
05:08:45,060 --> 05:08:50,840
Yeah, but the lazy shell cannot protect

3648
05:08:50,840 --> 05:08:59,810
from instant death, unfortunately.

3649
05:08:59,810 --> 05:09:01,169
Come back, Bowser, please.

3650
05:09:05,450 --> 05:09:21,419
I can't believe Bowser's fucking dead.

3651
05:09:31,020 --> 05:09:48,580
He's dead again.

3652
05:09:48,580 --> 05:09:50,700
Oh, by the way, anybody that comes back that says,

3653
05:09:50,700 --> 05:09:52,099
oh, did he do the 100 jumps?

3654
05:09:52,099 --> 05:09:57,909
Just say yes.

3655
05:09:57,909 --> 05:10:02,970
That was gonna take like 34 minutes.

3656
05:10:02,970 --> 05:10:06,659
That shit was gonna take the rest of the night to do that.

3657
05:10:06,659 --> 05:10:27,319
I had to pull the plug, I had to.

3658
05:10:27,319 --> 05:10:29,840
You played the Beetle game for an hour?

3659
05:10:30,860 --> 05:10:34,619
Yeah, but the Beetle game, that was like mind destroying,

3660
05:10:34,659 --> 05:10:37,459
trying to do that 100 jumps thing in the middle of a jump,

3661
05:10:37,459 --> 05:10:39,500
going through different timelines.

3662
05:10:39,500 --> 05:10:48,849
The fucking Twitter.

3663
05:10:52,540 --> 05:10:53,619
It was the same thing.

3664
05:10:53,619 --> 05:11:00,060
No, I can't, I can't.

3665
05:11:00,060 --> 05:11:16,090
Level 20, finally, good.

3666
05:11:16,090 --> 05:11:19,950
Oh no, look at all these crafted characters.

3667
05:11:42,139 --> 05:11:44,740
Maybe at the very end of the stream,

3668
05:11:44,740 --> 05:11:47,459
I will lose my fucking mind and try to get it done.

3669
05:11:49,580 --> 05:11:50,860
But not right now.

3670
05:11:50,860 --> 05:11:53,060
I wanna get through the rest of the game first.

3671
05:12:15,270 --> 05:12:18,180
21, when am I gonna do Kulex?

3672
05:12:18,180 --> 05:12:38,919
Very soon, actually, very soon.

3673
05:12:38,919 --> 05:12:45,700
Nope, good avoiding, good dodging.

3674
05:12:45,700 --> 05:12:53,540
Ah, hey, stop, I'm trying to move, stop.

3675
05:13:00,700 --> 05:13:38,560
Annoying, time to fight all the bosses again.

3676
05:13:38,560 --> 05:13:53,750
Remember these guys, remember this guy?

3677
05:13:53,750 --> 05:14:00,750
Wait, he got to 100, I was tabbed out, yeah.

3678
05:14:00,750 --> 05:14:01,590
How was your burger?

3679
05:14:01,590 --> 05:14:30,180
I think it's 200.

3680
05:14:30,180 --> 05:14:35,939
No, I thought I could teach to go.

3681
05:14:35,939 --> 05:14:39,599
Speaking of burgers, you know what I had?

3682
05:14:40,200 --> 05:14:47,150
Recently, that I actually thought was pretty good.

3683
05:14:47,270 --> 05:14:50,610
All right, you ready?

3684
05:14:50,610 --> 05:14:52,250
You know what I ate that I thought

3685
05:14:52,250 --> 05:14:58,229
was actually pretty damn good?

3686
05:14:58,229 --> 05:15:04,069
Hopefully nobody laughs at me for this, the Beyond Burger.

3687
05:15:04,069 --> 05:15:08,970
It was pretty good.

3688
05:15:08,970 --> 05:15:16,959
Subway, no, it's actually really damn good.

3689
05:15:18,080 --> 05:15:21,279
I went in like a total dick.

3690
05:15:24,659 --> 05:15:26,779
I didn't believe it all.

3691
05:15:26,779 --> 05:15:28,419
I was one of those people, like, okay,

3692
05:15:28,459 --> 05:15:33,819
because I'm serious, every fake meat I've ever had sucked.

3693
05:15:34,020 --> 05:15:36,650
It was fucking terrible.

3694
05:15:36,650 --> 05:15:39,529
I don't know what they do to the Beyond meat,

3695
05:15:39,529 --> 05:15:41,009
the Beyond like fake meat,

3696
05:15:41,009 --> 05:15:50,020
but it is the closest thing I've ever had.

3697
05:15:50,020 --> 05:15:56,060
I'm missing so many, I think ghosts, right?

3698
05:15:56,060 --> 05:15:57,740
I'm gonna leave, there's too many sponsorships

3699
05:15:57,740 --> 05:15:59,299
and you didn't jump 100 times.

3700
05:16:08,840 --> 05:16:17,380
Why can't they please just kill these things?

3701
05:16:17,380 --> 05:16:31,000
Die, ah.

3702
05:16:31,000 --> 05:16:44,740
Royal Syrup, the Maple Syrup, the Beyond Burger.

3703
05:16:44,740 --> 05:16:48,419
I was trying to go.

3704
05:16:48,419 --> 05:16:50,259
Oh, wow, that just was bad.

3705
05:16:50,259 --> 05:16:51,180
What the fuck?

3706
05:16:51,180 --> 05:16:57,810
I was, I panicked because I didn't know

3707
05:16:58,889 --> 05:17:01,580
what was going on here.

3708
05:17:01,580 --> 05:17:08,299
What's going on here?

3709
05:17:08,299 --> 05:17:32,099
Max Mushroom, second boss.

3710
05:17:32,099 --> 05:17:52,299
Out of, I was gonna say money, that was extra savory.

3711
05:18:05,349 --> 05:18:15,299
Good, just keep hitting them.

3712
05:18:15,340 --> 05:18:17,180
How long until the game ends?

3713
05:18:17,180 --> 05:18:22,520
Well, the game, the game ends very shortly,

3714
05:18:22,520 --> 05:18:26,200
but there's a very specific thing that I'm going to do.

3715
05:18:26,200 --> 05:18:30,639
I'm gonna try to beat the Impossible Burger Boss.

3716
05:18:35,580 --> 05:18:36,979
And then I'm gonna, no, I'm not,

3717
05:18:36,979 --> 05:18:41,720
I'm not gonna try to jump 100 times.

3718
05:18:41,720 --> 05:18:45,150
That's like 600 people left during that.

3719
05:18:45,150 --> 05:18:58,889
You want me to do that again?

3720
05:18:58,889 --> 05:19:00,729
You told them to.

3721
05:19:00,729 --> 05:19:01,770
No, I didn't tell them to leave,

3722
05:19:01,770 --> 05:19:04,450
I told them to make some food and come back.

3723
05:19:04,490 --> 05:19:06,770
I said, come back in five minutes and it'll be done.

3724
05:19:06,770 --> 05:19:09,849
It's been 20 minutes and nobody came back.

3725
05:19:09,849 --> 05:19:21,349
They found something better to do.

3726
05:19:21,349 --> 05:19:23,310
You told them to leave.

3727
05:19:23,310 --> 05:19:24,229
No, I didn't.

3728
05:19:24,229 --> 05:19:26,069
I said, go, if you don't,

3729
05:19:26,069 --> 05:19:28,349
just go make a hamburger and come back.

3730
05:19:28,349 --> 05:19:33,509
How long does it take to make a hamburger?

3731
05:19:33,509 --> 05:19:43,790
Actually, it depends.

3732
05:19:43,790 --> 05:19:46,349
It takes a fucking hour to make.

3733
05:19:49,810 --> 05:20:06,330
That's so funny.

3734
05:20:06,330 --> 05:20:08,169
It's all been deleted.

3735
05:20:08,330 --> 05:20:16,259
You gotta defrost it.

3736
05:20:19,720 --> 05:20:21,919
What do you mean, defrost it?

3737
05:20:21,919 --> 05:20:24,790
All right, now this is the time of the stream

3738
05:20:24,790 --> 05:20:34,380
where I go get Killex because we're getting to end game here.

3739
05:20:37,540 --> 05:20:48,529
Is there a way out of here?

3740
05:20:48,529 --> 05:20:52,250
I forget if there's a way out of here or not.

3741
05:20:52,250 --> 05:21:00,189
I think I actually have to go back.

3742
05:21:00,189 --> 05:21:01,189
It's all right.

3743
05:21:01,189 --> 05:21:22,619
Yeah, you defrost the ground beef.

3744
05:21:22,619 --> 05:21:25,619
You don't get those shitty Costco patties, do you?

3745
05:21:25,619 --> 05:21:28,819
No, I just get like,

3746
05:21:28,900 --> 05:21:31,139
I just get like grocery store hamburger.

3747
05:21:47,299 --> 05:21:48,299
You store it at room temperature?

3748
05:21:48,299 --> 05:21:52,860
No, I eat it within like a few days to get it.

3749
05:21:54,139 --> 05:21:57,139
Hey, behold, they've taken the bait.

3750
05:21:59,770 --> 05:22:02,009
I guess I can spare a few minutes.

3751
05:22:02,009 --> 05:22:12,709
Maybe they'd like to play.

3752
05:22:12,709 --> 05:22:30,380
Endable.

3753
05:22:30,380 --> 05:22:34,290
They throw a bunch of bosses at you at the very end.

3754
05:22:34,290 --> 05:22:43,040
This was a RPG trope back in the day.

3755
05:22:43,080 --> 05:22:45,000
You kind of had to go through a bunch of shit

3756
05:22:45,000 --> 05:22:55,979
before you got to the end.

3757
05:22:55,979 --> 05:22:57,020
God, I love it.

3758
05:22:57,020 --> 05:23:02,250
I love this game.

3759
05:23:02,250 --> 05:23:03,889
What a fun game just to play.

3760
05:23:20,860 --> 05:23:29,279
I think there is a way for me to get out still.

3761
05:23:29,279 --> 05:23:31,319
Phew, but weaklings.

3762
05:23:31,319 --> 05:23:36,700
How shameful if they were to defeat me.

3763
05:23:36,700 --> 05:23:45,150
Oh yeah, I forgot about this.

3764
05:23:45,150 --> 05:24:05,240
It's clobbering time.

3765
05:24:05,240 --> 05:24:08,840
Sued.

3766
05:24:08,840 --> 05:24:12,299
Mr. Alphlinton, you're going to jail.

3767
05:24:17,900 --> 05:24:20,580
There it is, I did it.

3768
05:24:20,580 --> 05:24:21,819
Right before it goes in.

3769
05:24:24,540 --> 05:24:27,099
That's much better.

3770
05:24:27,099 --> 05:24:29,139
All right, the mad adder or domino.

3771
05:24:29,139 --> 05:24:30,380
Let's go for domino.

3772
05:24:32,189 --> 05:24:33,029
It's easy for me.

3773
05:24:33,029 --> 05:24:36,189
Controlling the device, why not get him to shut it off?

3774
05:24:36,189 --> 05:24:48,380
Right?

3775
05:24:48,380 --> 05:24:50,979
Everyone's taking a lot of damage.

3776
05:24:50,979 --> 05:24:54,259
If you do 100 jumps, I'll give you $100.

3777
05:24:54,259 --> 05:24:56,419
I can't do it.

3778
05:24:56,419 --> 05:24:59,299
I mean, I will painfully attempt to do it a few times

3779
05:24:59,299 --> 05:25:03,740
at the very end of the stream, but not right now.

3780
05:25:14,200 --> 05:25:15,439
Don't kill Mario, please.

3781
05:25:30,819 --> 05:25:34,060
I have to do it on my first try?

3782
05:25:34,060 --> 05:25:51,200
Well, I can guarantee you that's not going to happen.

3783
05:25:51,200 --> 05:25:55,450
The highest I got legit was 37.

3784
05:25:55,450 --> 05:26:09,500
Or like 39 or something, right?

3785
05:26:09,500 --> 05:26:10,340
Inflating the number?

3786
05:26:10,340 --> 05:26:11,180
No, it was 37.

3787
05:26:17,810 --> 05:26:18,650
It was fine.

3788
05:26:22,090 --> 05:26:23,009
Ooh, that was big.

3789
05:26:24,490 --> 05:26:25,849
That's 436 damage.

3790
05:26:26,889 --> 05:26:29,819
And go.

3791
05:26:29,819 --> 05:26:32,619
Yeah, the clock, these two guys.

3792
05:26:32,659 --> 05:26:34,099
All the random physics experience.

3793
05:26:34,099 --> 05:26:39,520
All right, let's see if I can do this on my own.

3794
05:26:39,520 --> 05:26:42,529
All right, what's going on?

3795
05:26:42,529 --> 05:26:45,500
I don't find that to be very fair, but that's okay.

3796
05:26:45,500 --> 05:26:49,939
Peach 21, I want to do regular defense with Peach, I think.

3797
05:26:50,979 --> 05:26:57,709
No, magic.

3798
05:26:57,709 --> 05:27:01,549
So we are now at this stage where I believe I can.

3799
05:27:01,549 --> 05:27:02,990
All right, yeah, this, I'm at the,

3800
05:27:02,990 --> 05:27:04,869
this is the end of the game.

3801
05:27:04,869 --> 05:27:07,310
So let's go.

3802
05:27:07,310 --> 05:27:10,340
It's time.

3803
05:27:10,340 --> 05:27:11,299
I'm going to save it here.

3804
05:27:11,299 --> 05:27:20,400
I'm going to go back.

3805
05:27:20,400 --> 05:27:22,159
See if I can make it back quickly.

3806
05:27:22,159 --> 05:27:23,919
Oh my God.

3807
05:27:23,919 --> 05:27:25,119
We're going to try to kill, get rid of,

3808
05:27:25,119 --> 05:27:29,549
we're going to try to fight Culex.

3809
05:27:29,549 --> 05:27:32,860
It's not time for a hundred jumps.

3810
05:27:32,860 --> 05:27:35,900
That's after the game is finished and the credits roll.

3811
05:27:35,900 --> 05:27:38,540
And I'm, you know what?

3812
05:27:38,540 --> 05:27:41,540
You might, that's not going to happen.

3813
05:27:41,540 --> 05:27:43,259
That's going to be a waste of time.

3814
05:27:50,220 --> 05:27:52,259
Do it on Culex.

3815
05:27:52,259 --> 05:27:55,419
Is it Culex or Culex or Culex?

3816
05:28:05,169 --> 05:28:06,209
What's the name of this song?

3817
05:28:06,209 --> 05:28:13,009
It's called the March of the Doxans.

3818
05:28:13,009 --> 05:28:14,889
At least that's what my mother used to call it.

3819
05:28:18,360 --> 05:28:20,639
It's like the doggy, like march song.

3820
05:28:31,930 --> 05:28:33,009
Please run away.

3821
05:28:33,970 --> 05:28:38,380
All right, we did it.

3822
05:28:38,380 --> 05:28:41,979
Oh, my, my neck just ripped up to the ceiling

3823
05:28:41,979 --> 05:28:51,060
because I got caught by this.

3824
05:28:51,060 --> 05:28:53,340
I made that noise up into the sky.

3825
05:28:53,340 --> 05:28:59,099
First try, good.

3826
05:28:59,099 --> 05:29:05,860
Come on, fall, do it.

3827
05:29:05,860 --> 05:29:06,700
What the fuck?

3828
05:29:06,700 --> 05:29:14,500
I didn't do anything.

3829
05:29:14,500 --> 05:29:15,580
I'm going to do this quick.

3830
05:29:15,580 --> 05:29:19,279
Let's go, God.

3831
05:29:19,279 --> 05:29:22,500
I've lost step.

3832
05:29:22,500 --> 05:29:24,099
It's just certain at this point.

3833
05:29:32,560 --> 05:29:34,880
I wonder what the percentage is to do that.

3834
05:29:34,880 --> 05:29:37,599
What's the actual percentage to run away in games like this?

3835
05:29:37,599 --> 05:29:38,439
Especially this one.

3836
05:29:38,439 --> 05:29:59,279
I don't think I've ever known.

3837
05:29:59,279 --> 05:30:01,240
All right, almost done.

3838
05:30:01,240 --> 05:30:05,349
Just got to get past this part.

3839
05:30:05,349 --> 05:30:11,299
Good.

3840
05:30:11,299 --> 05:30:13,020
Actually, that is, that's better, I think.

3841
05:30:13,020 --> 05:30:14,889
Cause now I can.

3842
05:30:14,889 --> 05:30:17,290
Oh shit, what the fuck is in here?

3843
05:30:17,290 --> 05:30:20,000
All right.

3844
05:30:20,000 --> 05:30:30,360
I didn't know that was in here.

3845
05:30:30,360 --> 05:30:31,200
All right.

3846
05:30:31,200 --> 05:30:49,979
We're so close to being able to attempt Culex.

3847
05:30:50,580 --> 05:31:01,540
Where does this go?

3848
05:31:01,540 --> 05:31:04,139
You might be asking, why am I making another one?

3849
05:31:04,139 --> 05:31:12,720
Well, because Culex, I'm going to have two timelines.

3850
05:31:12,720 --> 05:31:15,040
We're going to have a beat the game timeline

3851
05:31:15,040 --> 05:31:15,880
to see the credits.

3852
05:31:15,880 --> 05:31:24,720
And then we're going to have a Culex timeline.

3853
05:31:24,720 --> 05:31:28,790
That's not what I want to do.

3854
05:31:28,790 --> 05:31:40,549
Timeline.

3855
05:31:40,549 --> 05:31:59,759
Am I going to get a turn?

3856
05:31:59,759 --> 05:32:01,560
All right.

3857
05:32:01,560 --> 05:32:04,279
I said, all right, like five times.

3858
05:32:04,279 --> 05:32:05,240
Okay.

3859
05:32:05,240 --> 05:32:07,470
All right.

3860
05:32:07,470 --> 05:32:08,909
All right.

3861
05:32:08,909 --> 05:32:10,029
All right.

3862
05:32:10,029 --> 05:32:12,919
Here we go.

3863
05:32:12,919 --> 05:32:14,400
The gate.

3864
05:32:14,400 --> 05:32:23,279
Let's go back and fight Mr. Culex.

3865
05:32:23,279 --> 05:32:24,319
I think we're equipped.

3866
05:32:24,319 --> 05:32:30,590
We're leveled up.

3867
05:32:30,590 --> 05:32:32,389
Let's just take a look at what we got.

3868
05:32:32,389 --> 05:32:36,939
Bowser, Mario, and Toadstool.

3869
05:32:36,939 --> 05:32:37,939
Lazy shell.

3870
05:32:39,060 --> 05:32:40,860
Lazy shell.

3871
05:32:40,860 --> 05:32:42,740
Ghost metal, jinx metal, tax, scarf.

3872
05:32:44,259 --> 05:32:45,659
I think we get to give it a go.

3873
05:32:47,380 --> 05:32:59,950
I'm going to save it over here.

3874
05:32:59,950 --> 05:33:11,599
See if I can beat him.

3875
05:33:11,599 --> 05:33:13,229
Greetings.

3876
05:33:13,229 --> 05:33:14,909
I am Culex.

3877
05:33:14,909 --> 05:33:16,310
Dark knight of thunder.

3878
05:33:17,909 --> 05:33:21,630
I've crossed into this dimension to fight for the dark mage,

3879
05:33:21,630 --> 05:33:25,090
but this world is uninhabitable for me of my kind.

3880
05:33:25,090 --> 05:33:26,729
I must return to my old world.

3881
05:33:28,310 --> 05:33:29,869
Before I go, though,

3882
05:33:29,869 --> 05:33:34,500
I would like to challenge your strongest knight.

3883
05:33:34,500 --> 05:33:38,049
Will you accept my challenge?

3884
05:33:38,049 --> 05:33:43,860
Will you enter combat against me?

3885
05:33:43,860 --> 05:33:47,959
Engage.

3886
05:33:47,959 --> 05:33:49,400
I am matter.

3887
05:33:49,400 --> 05:33:51,119
I am anti-matter.

3888
05:33:51,119 --> 05:33:52,959
I can see your past.

3889
05:33:52,959 --> 05:33:55,080
I can see your future.

3890
05:33:55,080 --> 05:33:56,799
I consume time.

3891
05:33:56,799 --> 05:34:04,740
And I will consume you.

3892
05:34:04,740 --> 05:34:08,619
So we got Culex, wind crystal, earth, water, and fire.

3893
05:34:08,619 --> 05:34:09,979
We're going to go with water.

3894
05:34:09,979 --> 05:34:11,259
One of these takes a lot of damage.

3895
05:34:11,259 --> 05:34:30,590
We're going to go with, yep, water crystal first.

3896
05:34:30,590 --> 05:34:31,430
All right, we got it.

3897
05:34:31,430 --> 05:34:32,270
That's not bad.

3898
05:34:32,270 --> 05:34:37,869
All of them do like two or three moves each.

3899
05:34:37,869 --> 05:34:41,349
This is me from the other timelines.

3900
05:34:41,349 --> 05:34:43,990
Oh, didn't even get a chance.

3901
05:34:43,990 --> 05:34:45,630
Didn't even get a chance.

3902
05:34:45,630 --> 05:34:47,229
That's why we've got, come back,

3903
05:34:47,229 --> 05:34:49,069
and I got the timing down correct.

3904
05:34:49,990 --> 05:34:50,909
It's right.

3905
05:34:52,150 --> 05:34:52,990
It's there.

3906
05:34:54,270 --> 05:35:05,020
Come on.

3907
05:35:05,020 --> 05:35:16,380
We got to get rid of that water crystal first.

3908
05:35:16,380 --> 05:35:18,099
You can't hurt Peach, I'm sorry.

3909
05:35:18,099 --> 05:35:21,380
Oh, I, you know what?

3910
05:35:21,380 --> 05:35:23,099
What the fuck does this do?

3911
05:35:23,099 --> 05:35:27,500
I don't know.

3912
05:35:27,500 --> 05:35:36,419
Defense up.

3913
05:35:36,419 --> 05:35:38,340
Don't do it to Mario, Peach.

3914
05:35:43,400 --> 05:35:46,470
Oh, Mario's going to die here.

3915
05:35:46,470 --> 05:35:48,029
Oh, thank God.

3916
05:35:48,029 --> 05:35:48,869
Would you look at that?

3917
05:35:48,869 --> 05:35:50,270
All right, let's do group hug.

3918
05:35:50,270 --> 05:35:51,750
No.

3919
05:35:51,750 --> 05:36:05,270
Hmm, yeah.

3920
05:36:05,270 --> 05:36:23,470
Pop it, come on.

3921
05:36:23,470 --> 05:36:24,750
I can throw up the candies,

3922
05:36:24,750 --> 05:36:26,110
the fire bombs, the rock candies and stuff.

3923
05:36:26,110 --> 05:36:27,069
Yeah, that's what I bet I do.

3924
05:36:27,069 --> 05:36:34,659
I'll do that.

3925
05:36:34,659 --> 05:36:36,139
Time for Yoshi.

3926
05:36:36,139 --> 05:36:40,290
Well, maybe in a minute.

3927
05:36:40,290 --> 05:36:49,860
No, I got to bring back Mario.

3928
05:36:49,860 --> 05:36:51,020
Fuck, what happened?

3929
05:36:52,349 --> 05:36:53,470
Auto P.

3930
05:36:53,470 --> 05:36:54,470
Don't even do this.

3931
05:36:54,470 --> 05:36:56,389
Don't start this bullshit again.

3932
05:36:56,389 --> 05:36:58,069
60 damage with the lazy shell.

3933
05:36:58,069 --> 05:36:59,229
That's fucking insane.

3934
05:37:01,500 --> 05:37:02,340
The last time people said,

3935
05:37:02,340 --> 05:37:04,020
oh, I auto peed in the house,

3936
05:37:04,020 --> 05:37:20,619
and I like ran downstairs and like nothing happened.

3937
05:37:20,619 --> 05:37:22,819
Kulex is a genus of mosquitoes.

3938
05:37:25,639 --> 05:37:26,799
All right, that's good.

3939
05:37:27,599 --> 05:37:29,520
We just need to get rid of the crystals

3940
05:37:29,520 --> 05:37:34,069
because they cause all the damage.

3941
05:37:34,069 --> 05:37:36,400
Mario, okay, there we go.

3942
05:37:36,400 --> 05:37:38,990
Peach is seriously just here

3943
05:37:38,990 --> 05:37:42,029
to bring people back and to heal and to stay alive.

3944
05:37:42,029 --> 05:37:43,869
I mean, obviously I have to be careful.

3945
05:37:49,560 --> 05:37:51,599
That was weird, it took a long time.

3946
05:37:51,599 --> 05:37:52,439
Oh, come on.

3947
05:37:56,529 --> 05:37:58,049
Ha ha ha ha.

3948
05:37:58,049 --> 05:38:04,500
I didn't even know I got attacked.

3949
05:38:04,500 --> 05:38:05,340
Pop it.

3950
05:38:05,340 --> 05:38:12,180
Ah.

3951
05:38:12,180 --> 05:38:17,169
Bro Luck just gave a hundred bucks.

3952
05:38:17,169 --> 05:38:18,889
I'm fighting bits.

3953
05:38:18,889 --> 05:38:22,560
Yes, I am.

3954
05:38:22,560 --> 05:38:25,680
Here, mate, here you are for the 100 jump challenge.

3955
05:38:25,680 --> 05:38:28,240
Just paying it forward now since I'll be leaving soon.

3956
05:38:28,240 --> 05:38:32,040
Thanks for completing the challenge.

3957
05:38:32,040 --> 05:38:34,060
I got some bad news.

3958
05:38:34,060 --> 05:38:35,779
I don't know if I will complete the challenge,

3959
05:38:35,779 --> 05:38:37,650
but thank you.

3960
05:38:37,650 --> 05:38:40,209
Thank you all and congratulations.

3961
05:38:40,209 --> 05:38:42,090
And thanks for the 100 fucking dollars.

3962
05:38:45,020 --> 05:38:46,500
Now you have to do it.

3963
05:38:46,500 --> 05:38:55,340
I will give it a real attempt, I promise you.

3964
05:38:55,340 --> 05:38:59,590
God, it's still there.

3965
05:38:59,590 --> 05:39:00,630
I almost want psychopaths

3966
05:39:00,630 --> 05:39:03,130
to find out how much health they have.

3967
05:39:03,130 --> 05:39:05,009
He paid you a hundred fucking dollars for that.

3968
05:39:05,009 --> 05:39:06,490
You have to.

3969
05:39:06,490 --> 05:39:07,849
I'm gonna try.

3970
05:39:15,189 --> 05:39:24,770
Damn, that hurt.

3971
05:39:24,770 --> 05:39:25,930
How much health does Peach have?

3972
05:39:25,930 --> 05:39:26,770
101.

3973
05:39:38,700 --> 05:39:40,819
Just get rid of the blue crystal.

3974
05:39:41,939 --> 05:39:45,770
No.

3975
05:39:45,770 --> 05:39:47,330
He does it a hundred times.

3976
05:39:47,330 --> 05:39:49,090
Oh, you're pathetic, Turbo.

3977
05:39:49,090 --> 05:39:49,930
I can do it.

3978
05:40:00,279 --> 05:40:01,119
Got it.

3979
05:40:01,119 --> 05:40:04,549
One down.

3980
05:40:04,549 --> 05:40:05,389
Yeah, I can do it.

3981
05:40:05,389 --> 05:40:06,389
Oops.

3982
05:40:06,389 --> 05:40:08,229
Sorry, hold on, let me rewind.

3983
05:40:08,229 --> 05:40:17,939
Let me read my time for a minute.

3984
05:40:17,939 --> 05:40:20,659
This is actually much harder than it looks.

3985
05:40:20,659 --> 05:40:22,619
Sorry for making fun of you earlier.

3986
05:40:29,139 --> 05:40:30,580
How do you do this without the lazy shell?

3987
05:40:30,580 --> 05:40:34,569
You don't.

3988
05:40:34,569 --> 05:40:38,209
There's another one, which one of them takes damage?

3989
05:40:38,209 --> 05:40:39,689
This one does.

3990
05:40:39,689 --> 05:40:51,950
One of them takes, I think they all do.

3991
05:40:51,950 --> 05:40:54,830
You have to get a bunch of rock candies.

3992
05:40:54,830 --> 05:40:57,369
Yeah.

3993
05:40:57,369 --> 05:40:59,250
You just get like 15 rock candies

3994
05:40:59,250 --> 05:41:01,049
and just use them all in a row

3995
05:41:01,049 --> 05:41:02,209
and heal the fuck out of everybody.

3996
05:41:02,209 --> 05:41:17,520
I hope you win.

3997
05:41:17,520 --> 05:41:19,810
Speaking of those,

3998
05:41:20,209 --> 05:41:26,619
rock candy, let's go ahead and use it.

3999
05:41:26,619 --> 05:41:27,540
200.

4000
05:41:27,540 --> 05:41:37,459
I'm gonna do it again.

4001
05:41:37,459 --> 05:41:38,299
You know what?

4002
05:41:38,299 --> 05:41:39,459
Let's get Yoshi out here too.

4003
05:41:39,459 --> 05:41:41,630
Come on out, Yoshi.

4004
05:41:41,630 --> 05:41:44,380
What are they?

4005
05:41:44,380 --> 05:41:48,139
For the first time, let's see what Yoshi does.

4006
05:41:48,139 --> 05:41:51,700
Come on out, boy.

4007
05:41:51,700 --> 05:42:06,680
Let's do it to, right to Coolix, let's go.

4008
05:42:06,680 --> 05:42:12,700
He did it.

4009
05:42:12,700 --> 05:42:18,529
He did it, he wins.

4010
05:42:18,529 --> 05:42:20,810
Yeah, I think he took a candy or something.

4011
05:42:27,040 --> 05:42:28,880
He stole something from Coolix.

4012
05:42:30,279 --> 05:42:32,439
Damn, that fucking hurts.

4013
05:42:32,439 --> 05:42:37,889
He stole, what'd he take?

4014
05:42:37,889 --> 05:42:40,959
Yoshi candy.

4015
05:42:40,959 --> 05:42:41,799
Yoshi candy?

4016
05:42:41,799 --> 05:42:47,470
We just gonna go for it?

4017
05:42:47,470 --> 05:42:57,810
Wait, where's my rock candy, there it is.

4018
05:42:57,810 --> 05:43:04,740
Got a freebie, I can do it again.

4019
05:43:04,740 --> 05:43:06,979
I was gonna say, this is how you lose the game.

4020
05:43:06,979 --> 05:43:10,939
Even with the lazy shell, if Peach gets transformed

4021
05:43:10,939 --> 05:43:14,479
and then she gets melee twice, it's over.

4022
05:43:14,479 --> 05:43:21,700
That can't happen.

4023
05:43:21,700 --> 05:43:22,779
Does group, how do I,

4024
05:43:22,779 --> 05:43:25,540
can I, does group pod get rid of status effects?

4025
05:43:28,279 --> 05:43:29,119
Yes, it does.

4026
05:43:30,080 --> 05:43:30,919
Jesus.

4027
05:43:34,419 --> 05:43:36,220
78, what is this bullshit?

4028
05:43:43,369 --> 05:43:45,290
34, what is this horseshit?

4029
05:43:45,290 --> 05:43:49,009
I have to go for it again.

4030
05:43:49,009 --> 05:43:51,810
I think it's magic, you have to do magic damage to it.

4031
05:43:51,810 --> 05:44:04,849
But nobody here really has very much magic damage.

4032
05:44:04,849 --> 05:44:07,330
Rock candy, yeah, I don't think I have any more rock candy.

4033
05:44:07,330 --> 05:44:09,700
I have fire bombs though.

4034
05:44:09,700 --> 05:44:11,220
Let's see if I have any more.

4035
05:44:11,220 --> 05:44:27,220
Oh no, I just got a freebie, right, yeah.

4036
05:44:27,220 --> 05:44:29,259
There it is, all right.

4037
05:44:29,259 --> 05:44:31,540
And let's do the fire bomb, go for it.

4038
05:44:36,580 --> 05:44:37,500
Just use all my items.

4039
05:44:37,500 --> 05:44:39,500
This is the hardest boss in the game.

4040
05:44:39,500 --> 05:44:42,380
The actual last boss is not even close to as hard as this.

4041
05:44:52,290 --> 05:45:06,610
Now let's heal Mario, did I miss that?

4042
05:45:06,610 --> 05:45:08,330
Now what's next, probably earth.

4043
05:45:10,430 --> 05:45:14,799
Yeah, that 360, burn this.

4044
05:45:24,959 --> 05:45:26,880
Yoshi candy, all right,

4045
05:45:26,880 --> 05:45:30,619
I'm gonna use the Yoshi candy on Mario.

4046
05:45:30,619 --> 05:45:40,700
Wish me luck, I actually don't even know what this does.

4047
05:45:40,700 --> 05:45:49,299
100 HP kills you instantly, that'd be bad.

4048
05:46:15,360 --> 05:46:19,369
You know, in all the years that I've played this game,

4049
05:46:19,369 --> 05:46:20,770
I don't know what that does.

4050
05:46:21,849 --> 05:46:23,409
It doesn't seem to do anything.

4051
05:46:23,409 --> 05:46:27,729
The shredder, does it take FP?

4052
05:46:27,729 --> 05:46:31,619
Does it, I don't know what it does.

4053
05:46:31,619 --> 05:46:33,619
It takes away all your buffs, oh my God.

4054
05:46:40,599 --> 05:46:41,959
What is this song called?

4055
05:46:41,959 --> 05:46:44,119
This song is probably just called

4056
05:46:44,119 --> 05:46:48,119
Kool-X's fight theme, I'm assuming, Kool-X battle.

4057
05:46:58,970 --> 05:47:12,909
Final Fantasy IV boss theme, that's fine, it's a Bowser.

4058
05:47:21,759 --> 05:47:25,380
And then we didn't have to deal with only Kool-X.

4059
05:47:25,380 --> 05:47:27,419
It shouldn't take very long.

4060
05:47:27,419 --> 05:47:30,069
It's the crystals that give him all the power.

4061
05:47:30,069 --> 05:47:32,240
Did I do lucky?

4062
05:47:32,240 --> 05:47:33,639
Just in case I don't remember, did I?

4063
05:47:33,639 --> 05:47:34,479
Let's do it.

4064
05:47:50,299 --> 05:47:56,979
Shit, I missed the camera.

4065
05:47:56,979 --> 05:47:58,979
He thinks Nintendo made this game, right?

4066
05:47:58,979 --> 05:48:07,799
Nintendo did not make this game.

4067
05:48:07,799 --> 05:48:16,900
This is a square soft game.

4068
05:48:16,939 --> 05:48:19,590
Nintendo just said, all right.

4069
05:48:27,180 --> 05:48:28,860
This is before the Enix merge.

4070
05:48:33,380 --> 05:48:35,659
It's a square from software game.

4071
05:48:37,299 --> 05:48:38,659
I don't know why that did that hurt my head

4072
05:48:38,659 --> 05:48:40,540
thinking of the thing you just said.

4073
05:48:40,540 --> 05:48:42,860
It's a from soft square software.

4074
05:48:42,860 --> 05:48:44,380
I have no idea what you said, I said it,

4075
05:48:44,380 --> 05:48:45,700
but I'm freaking out now.

4076
05:48:52,490 --> 05:48:54,569
Flame crystal going down, and then it's just Kool-X.

4077
05:48:54,569 --> 05:48:55,930
And then you get something.

4078
05:49:04,099 --> 05:49:07,380
Let's let Peach give it a whirl.

4079
05:49:07,380 --> 05:49:19,590
66 damage, not bad.

4080
05:49:19,590 --> 05:49:20,430
All right.

4081
05:49:20,909 --> 05:49:25,939
Just you and me, Kool-X.

4082
05:49:25,939 --> 05:49:27,540
And what do I want?

4083
05:49:27,540 --> 05:49:35,900
Let's just whack him.

4084
05:49:35,900 --> 05:49:39,500
You don't have any of your cool gadgets anymore.

4085
05:49:41,119 --> 05:49:43,919
You just are gonna take damage until you're dead.

4086
05:49:51,189 --> 05:49:52,909
Bowser is in trouble.

4087
05:49:52,909 --> 05:49:59,750
It's all right.

4088
05:49:59,750 --> 05:50:12,139
Just do the group.

4089
05:50:12,139 --> 05:50:14,259
Doom this world by breaking the crystals.

4090
05:50:17,720 --> 05:50:21,860
Well, maybe his world.

4091
05:50:21,860 --> 05:50:23,619
My world's gonna be all right, I think.

4092
05:50:23,619 --> 05:50:25,419
We're not in my world right now.

4093
05:50:25,419 --> 05:50:31,930
We're very clearly somewhere else.

4094
05:50:31,930 --> 05:50:33,770
He rented out an apartment in Monstro Town

4095
05:50:33,770 --> 05:50:36,220
and made a big black hole over here.

4096
05:50:36,220 --> 05:50:39,299
This is not even Monstro Town.

4097
05:50:39,299 --> 05:50:56,979
I missed that.

4098
05:50:56,979 --> 05:50:57,939
Won't be long now.

4099
05:50:59,580 --> 05:51:01,580
Another two, three rounds should be it.

4100
05:51:09,060 --> 05:51:19,959
348, goodbye.

4101
05:51:19,959 --> 05:51:22,200
244 EXP, double it.

4102
05:51:25,090 --> 05:51:28,889
Pay attention, because this is like 500 experience, so.

4103
05:51:33,830 --> 05:51:54,180
Here we go.

4104
05:51:54,180 --> 05:51:56,099
Oh shit, that's kind of split.

4105
05:52:00,860 --> 05:52:01,979
I don't know, guys.

4106
05:52:01,979 --> 05:52:10,250
That's, okay, all right.

4107
05:52:10,250 --> 05:52:14,680
That's a majority.

4108
05:52:14,680 --> 05:52:17,759
Ooh, no.

4109
05:52:49,700 --> 05:52:53,819
21, why does it keep it up?

4110
05:52:54,900 --> 05:53:02,680
24, he got so high, because he has this thing on.

4111
05:53:02,680 --> 05:53:05,400
22, how is her regular defense?

4112
05:53:05,400 --> 05:53:06,240
This is terrible.

4113
05:53:06,240 --> 05:53:08,799
I'm gonna go, she has to get a couple of points

4114
05:53:08,799 --> 05:53:10,080
in that shit, man.

4115
05:53:10,080 --> 05:53:15,689
Not like it matters, the game's over.

4116
05:53:15,689 --> 05:53:22,459
I already leveled up from that.

4117
05:53:22,500 --> 05:53:28,259
Ah, your spirit is strong.

4118
05:53:28,259 --> 05:53:30,880
Thank you, brave knight.

4119
05:53:30,880 --> 05:53:34,599
I will treasure this memento of my journey here.

4120
05:53:34,599 --> 05:53:39,840
Perhaps in another time, another game,

4121
05:53:39,840 --> 05:53:43,090
we may have been mortal enemies,

4122
05:53:43,090 --> 05:53:47,439
but as part, as comrades in arms.

4123
05:53:47,439 --> 05:53:55,540
Take this, treasure it as a keepsake of our fight.

4124
05:53:55,540 --> 05:53:58,290
Kulex decided on his own.

4125
05:53:58,290 --> 05:54:00,290
Nobody told him to do it.

4126
05:54:00,290 --> 05:54:04,860
He gave a quartz charm to Mario.

4127
05:54:04,860 --> 05:54:11,729
Beautiful stuff.

4128
05:54:11,729 --> 05:54:23,509
Farewell, champion knight.

4129
05:54:23,509 --> 05:54:24,909
It's blue text I got, and plus,

4130
05:54:24,909 --> 05:54:27,110
it's fun to make people very angry at me.

4131
05:54:30,740 --> 05:54:32,659
All right, so that's Kulex, he closed the door.

4132
05:54:32,659 --> 05:54:37,680
There's the quartz charm.

4133
05:54:37,680 --> 05:54:39,319
Shining source of power.

4134
05:54:40,669 --> 05:54:43,830
Now, it might look like he's not very good.

4135
05:54:49,090 --> 05:54:51,250
And in fact, I'm not even entirely sure

4136
05:54:51,250 --> 05:54:52,450
exactly what he's done.

4137
05:54:54,020 --> 05:55:23,490
Need 205, I'm ready.

4138
05:55:25,369 --> 05:55:27,729
Deal 50% more damage and take 50% less damage

4139
05:55:27,729 --> 05:55:28,849
and prevents instant death.

4140
05:55:28,849 --> 05:55:30,049
Well, that's incredible.

4141
05:55:32,209 --> 05:55:34,490
Use Gino, Bowser sucks.

4142
05:55:34,490 --> 05:55:35,569
All right, hold on.

4143
05:55:36,970 --> 05:56:44,040
For the final, Gino has to be in the party for the final fight.

4144
05:56:44,040 --> 05:56:47,509
Okay, here's the final party.

4145
05:56:47,509 --> 05:56:50,490
The original three from the very beginning of the game.

4146
05:56:50,490 --> 05:57:06,590
Malo, Gino, and Mario.

4147
05:57:06,590 --> 05:57:10,299
Plus, I'm gonna have to be fair with my party here.

4148
05:57:10,380 --> 05:57:13,099
Peach has been in the party for the last, like,

4149
05:57:13,099 --> 05:57:16,979
six or seven straight in-video game hours.

4150
05:57:18,580 --> 05:57:20,060
Bowser was in the first.

4151
05:57:20,060 --> 05:57:23,380
You know, we have not seen very much Malo in that party.

4152
05:57:23,380 --> 05:57:25,540
It's Mario and two nobodies.

4153
05:57:35,740 --> 05:57:42,439
Heals, Malo has a heal as well.

4154
05:57:42,439 --> 05:57:48,830
Let's go.

4155
05:57:48,830 --> 05:57:49,830
You have to make your party

4156
05:57:49,830 --> 05:57:56,900
who's currently playable in Smash.

4157
05:57:56,900 --> 05:57:58,900
You gonna, you, really?

4158
05:57:58,900 --> 05:58:00,869
Really?

4159
05:58:00,869 --> 05:58:03,220
That's not a very nice thing to say to me.

4160
05:58:03,220 --> 05:58:24,549
You know, I'm a huge Gino fan.

4161
05:58:24,549 --> 05:58:26,389
Sans got in Smash before Gino.

4162
05:58:26,389 --> 05:58:27,229
You know?

4163
05:58:27,229 --> 05:58:33,409
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4164
05:58:33,409 --> 05:58:35,610
LOL, Gino didn't get in Smash before Sans.

4165
05:58:35,610 --> 05:58:38,330
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4166
05:58:38,330 --> 05:58:39,409
Funny.

4167
05:58:39,409 --> 05:58:47,869
He was in Smash as a costume.

4168
05:58:47,869 --> 05:58:48,790
No, he's not.

4169
05:58:48,790 --> 05:58:49,909
He was in the old one.

4170
05:58:49,909 --> 05:58:52,750
And then, why did you make him in the new one

4171
05:58:52,750 --> 05:58:53,569
with the costume?

4172
05:58:53,569 --> 05:58:54,409
What's going on there?

4173
05:58:54,409 --> 05:58:55,229
Why can't they just put the new,

4174
05:58:55,229 --> 05:58:57,709
the costume in the new one?

4175
05:58:57,709 --> 05:58:58,549
Why?

4176
05:59:02,770 --> 05:59:03,970
That doesn't seem right.

4177
05:59:10,520 --> 05:59:22,349
Aim square.

4178
05:59:26,360 --> 05:59:29,909
That's so much damage.

4179
05:59:29,909 --> 05:59:31,509
Okay, this is gonna be like embarrassing

4180
05:59:31,509 --> 05:59:37,950
how quickly I beat this last boss here.

4181
05:59:37,950 --> 05:59:39,909
This is the final boss of the game

4182
05:59:39,909 --> 06:00:31,860
and I'm gonna, I'm gonna steamroll the final boss.

4183
06:00:31,860 --> 06:00:33,020
That's a cool looking enemy.

4184
06:00:33,020 --> 06:00:34,340
Hold on.

4185
06:00:34,340 --> 06:00:38,459
Oh, if you wanna see how the other final moves look like,

4186
06:00:38,459 --> 06:00:41,439
this is Gino's final attack move.

4187
06:00:42,439 --> 06:00:46,279
Shoot stars out of his hands for five,

4188
06:00:46,279 --> 06:00:48,880
I'm gonna beat the boss in like fucking three rounds.

4189
06:00:52,930 --> 06:01:08,439
I'm gonna do 1500 damage a turn.

4190
06:01:08,439 --> 06:01:09,360
I'm gonna hog.

4191
06:01:25,009 --> 06:01:26,009
A lot of experience.

4192
06:01:26,009 --> 06:01:27,090
Malo, that's why.

4193
06:01:27,090 --> 06:01:28,290
Okay, what do you got?

4194
06:01:28,290 --> 06:01:35,319
Let's get you over 150 HP.

4195
06:01:35,319 --> 06:01:36,159
Peach would have done more.

4196
06:01:36,159 --> 06:01:37,180
Absolutely.

4197
06:01:37,180 --> 06:01:44,509
Peach is a better character, but that's the thing.

4198
06:01:44,509 --> 06:01:46,830
I need to get some screen time for Malo

4199
06:01:46,830 --> 06:01:49,040
because I wanna see his other moves.

4200
06:01:49,360 --> 06:02:12,700
Didn't you get like a new super special move?

4201
06:02:12,700 --> 06:02:13,580
Oh, come on.

4202
06:02:13,580 --> 06:02:15,020
I thought I had it.

4203
06:02:15,020 --> 06:02:31,110
Sorry, we'll kill him in two hits.

4204
06:02:31,110 --> 06:02:47,970
Why is Malo so bad?

4205
06:02:47,970 --> 06:02:51,689
The attack power is not four, a damage, or eight?

4206
06:02:52,889 --> 06:02:54,650
That doesn't seem correct.

4207
06:02:54,650 --> 06:03:03,709
He's wearing armor, right?

4208
06:03:03,709 --> 06:03:04,549
My finger slipped.

4209
06:03:22,799 --> 06:03:26,669
Ice bomb, cool.

4210
06:03:26,669 --> 06:03:27,709
I can use that.

4211
06:03:28,549 --> 06:03:30,189
There we are.

4212
06:03:30,189 --> 06:03:31,029
We can get rid of this

4213
06:03:31,029 --> 06:03:33,430
because that's just this play through.

4214
06:03:33,430 --> 06:03:35,110
I'm kind of confused with the other ones before.

4215
06:03:35,110 --> 06:03:39,990
I think one of them is to do the Geno Whirl.

4216
06:03:39,990 --> 06:03:48,380
Okay, let's go.

4217
06:03:48,380 --> 06:03:50,580
Production is on schedule.

4218
06:03:50,580 --> 06:03:53,380
This despite the fact that Mack, Boyer, Yardavich,

4219
06:03:53,380 --> 06:03:55,900
and the Axum Rangers were defeated.

4220
06:03:55,900 --> 06:03:59,610
At this rate, Smithy will have a new army in no time.

4221
06:03:59,610 --> 06:04:01,130
A new army?

4222
06:04:01,130 --> 06:04:02,490
You can't be making more weapons.

4223
06:04:02,490 --> 06:04:05,369
Haven't you caught enough trouble already?

4224
06:04:05,369 --> 06:04:08,560
Oh yeah, who are you?

4225
06:04:08,560 --> 06:04:10,240
This is Mario.

4226
06:04:10,240 --> 06:04:13,799
Give up now or you still have a chance.

4227
06:04:13,799 --> 06:04:17,689
Shut down production now or I'll stomp you.

4228
06:04:17,689 --> 06:04:20,889
What did you say, you little puff ball?

4229
06:04:20,889 --> 06:04:22,770
Mad Malo, trash him.

4230
06:04:45,439 --> 06:05:02,810
All right, let's see what you got.

4231
06:05:02,810 --> 06:05:18,779
Easiest final, this is not the final boss.

4232
06:05:18,779 --> 06:05:19,900
It's Shovel Knight.

4233
06:05:23,490 --> 06:05:28,259
That is, actually Shovel Knight.

4234
06:05:28,259 --> 06:05:40,669
He just needs to be blue.

4235
06:05:40,669 --> 06:05:41,509
22.

4236
06:05:43,720 --> 06:05:46,759
Let's round out, I need this.

4237
06:05:47,909 --> 06:05:51,349
Mario's so bad in regards to magic.

4238
06:05:51,349 --> 06:05:54,319
Huh, hope you learned your lesson.

4239
06:05:54,319 --> 06:05:55,840
We're almost there, Mario.

4240
06:05:55,840 --> 06:06:03,270
Come on.

4241
06:06:03,270 --> 06:06:07,540
What do you think this does?

4242
06:06:07,540 --> 06:06:11,590
Nothing happened.

4243
06:06:11,590 --> 06:06:12,430
Huh?

4244
06:06:12,430 --> 06:06:14,630
Must be the funny face, Mario.

4245
06:06:14,630 --> 06:06:17,509
Oh, I know, you're trying to make me look, aren't you?

4246
06:06:17,509 --> 06:06:20,430
I'm not gonna fall for that one.

4247
06:06:20,430 --> 06:06:24,270
Wait, help, help me, help me, help me, help me, help me.

4248
06:06:25,830 --> 06:06:27,430
Oh, that was scary.

4249
06:06:27,430 --> 06:06:33,669
I guess the green switch controls are the cranes.

4250
06:06:33,709 --> 06:06:35,830
Mario.

4251
06:06:35,830 --> 06:06:36,669
No, Mario.

4252
06:06:40,029 --> 06:06:44,919
I had to beat the whole game.

4253
06:06:44,919 --> 06:06:46,919
All these things respawn.

4254
06:06:46,919 --> 06:06:49,819
I finally made it here.

4255
06:06:49,819 --> 06:06:51,639
Let me help you.

4256
06:06:51,639 --> 06:06:59,119
Mario, Princess.

4257
06:06:59,119 --> 06:07:02,950
Sorry, I snuck out without telling you or the Chancellor.

4258
06:07:02,950 --> 06:07:05,110
I just wanted things to get back to normal.

4259
06:07:05,110 --> 06:07:09,830
I wanted to do my part to help.

4260
06:07:09,830 --> 06:07:14,159
Princess, yeah, that's it.

4261
06:07:14,159 --> 06:07:16,000
Any job that lets me help both Mario

4262
06:07:16,040 --> 06:07:17,560
and the Princess is worth doing.

4263
06:07:17,560 --> 06:07:18,599
My voice won't do it.

4264
06:07:18,599 --> 06:07:19,840
I'm trying to do that.

4265
06:07:19,840 --> 06:07:21,860
I can't do it.

4266
06:07:21,860 --> 06:07:24,250
You're gonna help both of us.

4267
06:07:24,250 --> 06:07:26,569
Well, I carried all I could.

4268
06:07:26,569 --> 06:07:27,689
Now what can you use?

4269
06:07:38,110 --> 06:07:40,189
Maybe a couple of these, maybe a couple of these,

4270
06:07:40,189 --> 06:07:41,630
a couple of these.

4271
06:07:41,630 --> 06:07:42,909
That's all I need, man.

4272
06:07:42,909 --> 06:07:46,319
I told, I really don't wanna say this to you,

4273
06:07:46,319 --> 06:07:50,939
but you wasted all week getting here.

4274
06:07:50,939 --> 06:07:52,700
I don't need any of this stuff.

4275
06:07:52,700 --> 06:07:54,380
I was all right.

4276
06:07:54,380 --> 06:07:55,819
I just came from beating Culex.

4277
06:07:55,819 --> 06:07:58,419
He's a Final Fantasy IV boss.

4278
06:07:58,419 --> 06:08:00,020
I don't need any more mid-mushrooms.

4279
06:08:00,020 --> 06:08:01,860
I'm sorry, I like, I'm buying them

4280
06:08:01,860 --> 06:08:06,569
because they're gonna feel bad for you.

4281
06:08:06,569 --> 06:08:08,990
This is for you.

4282
06:08:08,990 --> 06:08:09,909
Oh, rock candy.

4283
06:08:11,819 --> 06:08:23,340
Thanks, Toad.

4284
06:08:23,340 --> 06:08:25,680
Thank you, Toad.

4285
06:08:25,680 --> 06:08:27,200
We're almost there.

4286
06:08:27,200 --> 06:08:29,970
Come on, let's go, let's show him.

4287
06:08:29,970 --> 06:08:32,189
Toad has joined your party.

4288
06:08:32,189 --> 06:08:36,159
Why wouldn't Toad be in the party?

4289
06:08:36,159 --> 06:08:37,119
I'm just thinking about this

4290
06:08:37,119 --> 06:08:40,150
and this is kind of strange to me.

4291
06:08:40,150 --> 06:08:41,229
There are five party,

4292
06:08:41,229 --> 06:08:46,279
why wouldn't you get a nice clean rounded six?

4293
06:08:46,279 --> 06:08:47,759
Or even seven with Luigi.

4294
06:08:48,759 --> 06:08:54,259
Thank you, sir.

4295
06:08:54,259 --> 06:08:57,590
Here's the report.

4296
06:08:57,590 --> 06:09:02,869
Sir, drill bit will be finished on time.

4297
06:09:02,869 --> 06:09:05,659
We're ahead of schedule.

4298
06:09:05,659 --> 06:09:09,290
We'll make Smithy proud.

4299
06:09:09,290 --> 06:09:11,209
Good work, everyone.

4300
06:09:11,209 --> 06:09:15,209
The harder we work, the stronger Smithy will become.

4301
06:09:15,209 --> 06:09:19,209
It's me, actual Shovel Knight this time.

4302
06:09:19,209 --> 06:09:24,419
The weapons we manufacture here will be just think of it.

4303
06:09:24,419 --> 06:09:27,819
When Smithy takes over Mario's world,

4304
06:09:27,819 --> 06:09:33,220
we can do anything we want.

4305
06:09:33,220 --> 06:09:36,400
Ah, ah, funny.

4306
06:09:36,400 --> 06:09:38,000
Someone just did a funny joke.

4307
06:09:38,000 --> 06:09:38,840
I can't.

4308
06:09:40,979 --> 06:09:42,580
Not so fast.

4309
06:09:42,580 --> 06:09:44,419
You sure are a cocky bunch.

4310
06:09:51,720 --> 06:09:54,919
I've ruled this world, don't you forget it.

4311
06:09:54,919 --> 06:09:56,639
It's Mario.

4312
06:09:56,639 --> 06:10:02,750
Mac, too, and the Artemis, too, didn't stop him.

4313
06:10:02,750 --> 06:10:05,069
No, no, leave Mario out of this.

4314
06:10:05,069 --> 06:10:06,830
I'm the only one you need to worry about,

4315
06:10:06,830 --> 06:10:08,970
not him.

4316
06:10:08,970 --> 06:10:13,599
Mario, you're about to make the longest jump of your life.

4317
06:10:13,599 --> 06:10:29,549
You're ignoring me.

4318
06:10:29,549 --> 06:10:30,990
Oh, it's okay.

4319
06:10:30,990 --> 06:10:36,520
We'll get it with the Gino Flash.

4320
06:10:36,520 --> 06:10:38,880
Shovel Knight got us a smash before Gino did.

4321
06:10:45,139 --> 06:10:46,979
Oh, that's right.

4322
06:10:46,979 --> 06:10:50,720
I'm gonna start handing out permabans.

4323
06:10:50,720 --> 06:11:14,599
Cut it out.

4324
06:11:14,599 --> 06:11:15,439
That sucked.

4325
06:11:22,240 --> 06:11:24,639
Malo might actually not be very good, huh?

4326
06:11:28,860 --> 06:11:29,939
Damn.

4327
06:11:29,939 --> 06:11:45,180
I might have to bring back Peach.

4328
06:11:45,180 --> 06:11:48,349
Use spell, I just did use a spell.

4329
06:11:49,189 --> 06:12:19,680
Oh, well, like the moon over, like the...

4330
06:12:19,680 --> 06:12:22,799
Like the moon over the day.

4331
06:12:22,799 --> 06:12:26,680
My genius and brawn, I lost on these fools

4332
06:12:26,680 --> 06:12:28,919
at the small height point that I wrote.

4333
06:12:28,919 --> 06:12:30,080
It had nothing to do with the game.

4334
06:12:30,080 --> 06:12:32,520
I just, as the narrator, decided to come in

4335
06:12:32,520 --> 06:12:33,919
and give you some knowledge.

4336
06:12:46,779 --> 06:12:48,659
Oh, everybody hates that so much,

4337
06:12:48,659 --> 06:12:50,340
and like, I can't stop doing it.

4338
06:12:54,959 --> 06:12:58,319
You there, are you the one in charge here?

4339
06:12:58,319 --> 06:13:01,159
Do you know what your weapons have been doing to our world?

4340
06:13:01,159 --> 06:13:07,130
Stop this nonsense at once.

4341
06:13:07,130 --> 06:13:09,729
I'm afraid that isn't possible.

4342
06:13:10,610 --> 06:13:13,450
Any dissent against Smithy will be dealt with

4343
06:13:13,450 --> 06:13:15,250
by immediate meltdown.

4344
06:13:17,349 --> 06:13:18,630
Meltdown?

4345
06:13:18,630 --> 06:13:22,259
You can't scare me, I've got Mario by my side.

4346
06:13:22,259 --> 06:13:24,740
Dissenters will be eliminated.

4347
06:13:24,740 --> 06:13:34,610
Production will continue.

4348
06:13:34,610 --> 06:13:50,700
Right for the director.

4349
06:13:50,700 --> 06:13:55,220
I really, I really hope there's no more blue text

4350
06:13:55,220 --> 06:13:56,060
in the game.

4351
06:14:04,029 --> 06:14:09,540
I hope that's the last of the, of narrator blue text Trump.

4352
06:14:09,540 --> 06:14:33,040
Malo, it was so bad.

4353
06:14:33,040 --> 06:14:34,959
Oh, that's right, he does have the lazy shell on,

4354
06:14:34,959 --> 06:14:40,319
so that makes him almost 100% useless.

4355
06:14:40,319 --> 06:14:42,639
Right, Malo cannot have this.

4356
06:14:42,639 --> 06:14:44,639
It makes him almost totally useless.

4357
06:14:50,009 --> 06:14:56,319
He only has HP rain, yeah, I gotta bring in Peach.

4358
06:14:56,319 --> 06:14:58,080
This is the worst spell.

4359
06:14:58,080 --> 06:15:00,040
It's his final move, it's like the best,

4360
06:15:00,040 --> 06:15:14,349
it's his final smash.

4361
06:15:14,349 --> 06:15:15,310
That was scary.

4362
06:15:16,229 --> 06:15:17,750
But we can't run away now.

4363
06:15:17,750 --> 06:15:45,020
We've got to kick these lowlifes out of our world.

4364
06:15:45,020 --> 06:15:56,279
We're going straight up, just absolute DPS.

4365
06:15:56,279 --> 06:16:00,740
Quartz Charm, Jink, Spell, Textar.

4366
06:16:00,740 --> 06:16:02,779
Jerma, you're using the wrong spell.

4367
06:16:22,889 --> 06:16:28,369
Mario, I'm surprised to see you here.

4368
06:16:28,369 --> 06:16:31,310
This is the end of the line for you.

4369
06:16:31,310 --> 06:16:34,360
This is the closest you'll ever get to Smithy.

4370
06:16:34,360 --> 06:16:35,639
So, save it a moment.

4371
06:16:38,619 --> 06:16:41,740
You'll be fodder for my incredible invention.

4372
06:16:41,779 --> 06:16:54,360
The Gun Yolk.

4373
06:16:54,360 --> 06:16:57,959
I just don't want him to see it, you know?

4374
06:16:57,959 --> 06:17:06,639
I don't want him to see us destroying his invention.

4375
06:17:06,639 --> 06:17:08,880
This is a DPS, you see what I'm saying?

4376
06:17:08,880 --> 06:17:11,259
You see what I'm talking about here?

4377
06:17:11,259 --> 06:17:15,220
We're doing pure hundreds of damage each second.

4378
06:17:15,220 --> 06:17:23,400
How much DPS is this?

4379
06:17:23,400 --> 06:17:25,080
Well, we're down to about 12.

4380
06:17:43,000 --> 06:17:45,799
I think we're about five damage per second at this point.

4381
06:17:55,950 --> 06:17:57,150
If only Peach could heal.

4382
06:17:58,790 --> 06:18:07,029
We're not even gonna need it.

4383
06:18:07,029 --> 06:18:14,560
Pure DPS.

4384
06:18:14,560 --> 06:18:20,200
All three of them might die right now.

4385
06:18:20,200 --> 06:18:26,819
We're good.

4386
06:18:26,819 --> 06:18:32,790
Sometimes, that was, you saw how quick that was?

4387
06:18:32,790 --> 06:18:33,630
Damage.

4388
06:18:39,279 --> 06:18:42,209
The production line has been halted.

4389
06:18:42,209 --> 06:18:53,669
Look Mario, this is where the weapons come from.

4390
06:18:53,669 --> 06:18:57,630
This must be where Smithy makes his weapons.

4391
06:18:57,630 --> 06:19:01,639
Define the last star piece and stop the factory.

4392
06:19:01,639 --> 06:19:04,119
We've gotta defeat him first.

4393
06:19:04,119 --> 06:19:08,000
Mario, there's no turning back now.

4394
06:19:08,040 --> 06:19:11,080
Are you ready?

4395
06:19:11,080 --> 06:19:13,569
Our quest is almost over.

4396
06:19:13,569 --> 06:20:06,040
And when the time comes, let's get this show on the road.

4397
06:20:06,040 --> 06:20:19,380
Here we go, here we go.

4398
06:20:19,380 --> 06:20:24,450
Joel, Joel just came in with a raid right now.

4399
06:20:24,450 --> 06:20:30,319
Right at the perfect moment.

4400
06:20:30,319 --> 06:20:31,560
What's going on, everybody?

4401
06:20:31,560 --> 06:20:32,520
Thanks, Joel.

4402
06:20:32,520 --> 06:20:34,790
Hope you had a good stream.

4403
06:20:34,790 --> 06:20:37,110
We are currently finishing Super Mario RPG.

4404
06:20:37,110 --> 06:20:38,310
This is the, by the way, hold on.

4405
06:20:38,310 --> 06:20:41,229
Wait, wait, it's up to hot.

4406
06:20:41,229 --> 06:20:43,509
If you never played Mario RPG before,

4407
06:20:45,540 --> 06:20:48,380
you just walked into the theater in the last 10 seconds

4408
06:20:48,380 --> 06:20:49,540
of like Infinity War.

4409
06:20:54,560 --> 06:20:56,119
Okay, so this is the last,

4410
06:20:56,119 --> 06:20:58,439
this is the final battle of Mario RPG.

4411
06:20:58,439 --> 06:21:02,020
Here we go.

4412
06:21:02,020 --> 06:21:02,979
Welcome.

4413
06:21:02,979 --> 06:21:05,979
You ready?

4414
06:21:05,979 --> 06:21:08,750
Turns out it's fucking Santa Claus.

4415
06:21:08,750 --> 06:21:12,159
Hey, there's our last star piece.

4416
06:21:17,340 --> 06:21:20,369
What, huh?

4417
06:21:20,369 --> 06:21:23,509
Already finished your tour of the factory, huh?

4418
06:21:23,509 --> 06:21:25,189
All right then.

4419
06:21:25,189 --> 06:21:26,990
How about a little demonstration?

4420
06:21:31,240 --> 06:21:35,049
Hey, yo, Smithy, stop making those things

4421
06:21:35,049 --> 06:21:39,759
and hand over the star piece now.

4422
06:21:39,799 --> 06:21:41,279
Yeah.

4423
06:21:41,279 --> 06:21:42,119
Huh?

4424
06:21:42,119 --> 06:21:47,119
Oh, so you're the Mario.

4425
06:21:47,119 --> 06:21:53,479
Looks like we're gonna have a little dispute over this star.

4426
06:21:53,479 --> 06:21:57,439
Just hand it over and get out of my castle.

4427
06:21:57,439 --> 06:22:00,439
My, my, we're a little touchy today, aren't we?

4428
06:22:01,599 --> 06:22:07,919
You know, I'm actually growing rather fond of this place.

4429
06:22:07,919 --> 06:22:10,159
Please don't make us go through any more.

4430
06:22:10,159 --> 06:22:11,919
Just give us the star now.

4431
06:22:13,840 --> 06:22:17,119
Okay, better yet.

4432
06:22:17,119 --> 06:22:21,290
Why don't you give me all of your stars?

4433
06:22:21,290 --> 06:22:24,970
Why, then I could easily conquer the world.

4434
06:22:24,970 --> 06:22:26,770
Then we can get rid of all these wishes

4435
06:22:26,770 --> 06:22:33,939
and create a world filled with weapons.

4436
06:22:33,939 --> 06:22:42,979
Over here now, I'll crush you all.

4437
06:22:42,979 --> 06:22:44,819
Oh, why can't we have five people at the party?

4438
06:22:44,819 --> 06:23:07,270
Here we go, best song in the game.

4439
06:23:07,270 --> 06:23:11,479
Swear.

4440
06:23:11,479 --> 06:23:13,389
That didn't hurt.

4441
06:23:13,389 --> 06:23:14,229
That shit, you know what?

4442
06:23:14,229 --> 06:23:20,900
Just keep, let's just keep healing.

4443
06:23:20,900 --> 06:23:24,380
Let's shut off your weapon fouls, I think.

4444
06:23:24,380 --> 06:23:32,610
That's probably a good idea.

4445
06:23:32,610 --> 06:23:36,000
First time we've seen that move, it hurts.

4446
06:23:36,000 --> 06:23:37,919
Everybody but Peach, obviously.

4447
06:23:42,959 --> 06:23:51,599
Uh-oh, that's all you made?

4448
06:23:51,599 --> 06:23:53,680
Well, that's kind of, that's kind of shitty,

4449
06:23:53,680 --> 06:23:56,880
I'm not gonna lie.

4450
06:23:56,880 --> 06:24:04,080
You can make anything.

4451
06:24:04,080 --> 06:24:13,139
Hmm, let's see what this does.

4452
06:24:13,139 --> 06:24:15,560
You can make anything.

4453
06:24:15,560 --> 06:24:17,000
Who do you think's been making all these bad guys

4454
06:24:17,000 --> 06:24:24,939
for the whole game?

4455
06:24:24,939 --> 06:24:27,500
You know, when I was younger,

4456
06:24:27,500 --> 06:24:31,779
I truly did not understand that he was like a Smith.

4457
06:24:31,779 --> 06:24:33,819
I thought he was like, that was a last name.

4458
06:24:33,819 --> 06:24:36,119
Like, oh, it's Smithy.

4459
06:24:36,119 --> 06:24:39,799
Like, his name was like Dan Smith.

4460
06:24:39,799 --> 06:24:49,150
I did not get it when I was like 12 or 13.

4461
06:24:49,150 --> 06:25:02,869
Dan Smithy.

4462
06:25:02,869 --> 06:25:04,709
I didn't get it when I was 26.

4463
06:25:06,650 --> 06:25:11,799
All right, that's a little different.

4464
06:25:11,799 --> 06:25:12,639
Okay, it's shut off now.

4465
06:25:12,639 --> 06:25:13,919
Let's get rid of that little guy.

4466
06:25:13,919 --> 06:25:16,639
Now we can't make any more.

4467
06:25:16,639 --> 06:25:17,639
That's a one hit KO.

4468
06:25:29,470 --> 06:25:30,389
Just got it.

4469
06:25:32,889 --> 06:25:35,209
Oh, so he's like a black Smith.

4470
06:25:36,330 --> 06:25:46,560
Oh, really?

4471
06:25:46,560 --> 06:25:47,400
Hold on, wait a minute.

4472
06:25:47,400 --> 06:25:50,439
You tell me, you tell me Dan Smith is a black Smith?

4473
06:25:50,439 --> 06:25:52,240
That's fucking crazy.

4474
06:25:52,240 --> 06:25:55,229
That's crazy.

4475
06:25:55,229 --> 06:25:56,310
That was pretty good.

4476
06:25:56,310 --> 06:25:57,349
That was pretty good.

4477
06:26:13,770 --> 06:26:19,520
Mega drink.

4478
06:26:19,520 --> 06:26:32,700
Let's let Peach get a little fucking shot in there.

4479
06:26:32,700 --> 06:26:33,619
Did I already beat the hardest boss?

4480
06:26:33,619 --> 06:26:35,060
I did.

4481
06:26:35,060 --> 06:26:35,900
I did.

4482
06:26:46,840 --> 06:26:47,680
No!

4483
06:26:48,680 --> 06:26:56,259
Calm down, Smithy.

4484
06:26:56,259 --> 06:27:00,900
Your head looks like a geyser.

4485
06:27:00,900 --> 06:27:03,119
Don't get so worked up.

4486
06:27:03,119 --> 06:27:04,520
Think of your blood pressure.

4487
06:27:08,860 --> 06:27:11,380
We just built this yesterday

4488
06:27:11,380 --> 06:27:13,580
and the foundation's very weak.

4489
06:27:13,580 --> 06:27:15,459
So stop shaking the floor.

4490
06:27:17,740 --> 06:27:19,380
How utterly annoying.

4491
06:27:25,400 --> 06:27:27,750
What the?

4492
06:27:27,750 --> 06:27:34,590
How in the heck?

4493
06:27:34,590 --> 06:27:37,549
Fuck, fuck, fuck, shit, fuck.

4494
06:27:37,549 --> 06:27:38,990
Oh shit.

4495
06:27:39,709 --> 06:27:40,549
Oh, ow, no.

4496
06:27:51,759 --> 06:27:54,759
Ooh, I'm burning, I'm seething.

4497
06:27:59,000 --> 06:28:01,799
Never have I been so wronged.

4498
06:28:01,799 --> 06:28:03,680
It is time.

4499
06:28:03,680 --> 06:28:07,279
I will show you my real form.

4500
06:28:07,279 --> 06:28:09,360
I will show you my true power.

4501
06:28:09,360 --> 06:28:17,209
I will teach you respect and I shall have my revenge.

4502
06:28:17,369 --> 06:28:18,209
Oh.

4503
06:28:29,689 --> 06:28:37,169
Do it.

4504
06:28:37,169 --> 06:28:43,139
Goo, come on, you puny ants.

4505
06:28:43,139 --> 06:29:00,599
I can take y'all at the same time.

4506
06:29:00,599 --> 06:29:43,009
Now this is actually the best song.

4507
06:29:43,009 --> 06:29:45,090
Can't block it.

4508
06:29:45,090 --> 06:29:52,290
Let's shut him off.

4509
06:29:52,290 --> 06:29:54,330
Yoko Shimomura was pumping out bangers

4510
06:29:54,330 --> 06:29:55,169
before King of Hearts.

4511
06:29:55,169 --> 06:29:58,009
Oh yeah.

4512
06:29:58,009 --> 06:30:01,650
Oh, he's supposed to heal.

4513
06:30:01,650 --> 06:30:03,369
Oh, let's go with an ultra jump.

4514
06:30:23,560 --> 06:30:34,270
Can't move.

4515
06:30:34,310 --> 06:30:37,110
That was so, Peach has the lazy shell.

4516
06:30:37,110 --> 06:30:41,009
You know how much damage that is?

4517
06:30:41,009 --> 06:30:59,759
In fact, let's, all right.

4518
06:30:59,759 --> 06:31:02,759
Well, 582 damage, that was big.

4519
06:31:10,919 --> 06:31:12,319
582.

4520
06:31:12,319 --> 06:31:19,919
Back to the, oh no, stay there, that's fine.

4521
06:31:19,919 --> 06:31:21,360
This thing takes the most damage.

4522
06:31:21,360 --> 06:31:22,720
I might kill you before you even get a chance

4523
06:31:22,720 --> 06:31:26,090
to go to the end of the phase.

4524
06:31:26,090 --> 06:31:28,770
Dude, keep doing over 500 damage each hit.

4525
06:31:30,189 --> 06:31:33,610
You specials are no reason to.

4526
06:31:33,610 --> 06:31:35,490
They do way more, like Mario does five,

4527
06:31:36,049 --> 06:31:38,250
doing like a super jump or an ultra jump or a flame

4528
06:31:38,250 --> 06:31:40,529
is only gonna do like 200 damage to this guy.

4529
06:31:42,659 --> 06:31:43,939
Same thing with like Gino at this point,

4530
06:31:43,939 --> 06:31:46,459
like Gino flash, Gino blast, it is not worth it.

4531
06:31:46,459 --> 06:31:48,939
You just do so much more, 446, that's it.

4532
06:31:48,939 --> 06:31:50,580
It's over, I just beat the game.

4533
06:31:53,959 --> 06:31:56,279
I am burning with power.

4534
06:31:56,279 --> 06:31:58,439
No, I'm just kidding, that was a lie.

4535
06:31:58,439 --> 06:31:59,479
I thought that was it.

4536
06:32:10,400 --> 06:32:11,240
Dark Star.

4537
06:32:12,080 --> 06:32:25,069
And I'm gonna change to the mailbox.

4538
06:32:25,349 --> 06:32:40,349
Or whatever the hell that is.

4539
06:32:40,349 --> 06:32:41,909
Is it treasure chest?

4540
06:32:41,909 --> 06:32:45,630
I know, that's a mailbox ever since I was a little kid.

4541
06:32:45,630 --> 06:32:47,189
It can't be anything else to me.

4542
06:32:50,919 --> 06:33:11,310
Whoa, all right, this is a really weird looking one,

4543
06:33:11,310 --> 06:33:16,020
isn't there a fourth one that we haven't seen yet?

4544
06:33:18,799 --> 06:33:21,439
There's the mailbox, the tank, the magician head,

4545
06:33:21,439 --> 06:33:23,040
and I think there's another one.

4546
06:33:23,479 --> 06:33:44,049
Okay, close.

4547
06:33:53,110 --> 06:33:54,709
Oh, that's not it, all right, well,

4548
06:33:54,709 --> 06:33:58,110
this is at least 2,000, 3,000 damage here.

4549
06:33:59,869 --> 06:34:00,869
It's a fruit bucket.

4550
06:34:07,919 --> 06:34:10,200
690 damage for one attack.

4551
06:34:16,319 --> 06:34:18,520
That might be the, I mean, I'm gonna be real with you,

4552
06:34:18,520 --> 06:34:20,439
that might be the single biggest damage attack

4553
06:34:20,439 --> 06:34:25,959
I think there's ever been.

4554
06:34:25,959 --> 06:34:31,159
With just a standard attack, it was 700 damage.

4555
06:34:31,159 --> 06:34:32,799
Oh shit, you're right, you're right, you're right, you're right.

4556
06:34:32,799 --> 06:34:34,479
I forgot, I still have these.

4557
06:34:34,639 --> 06:34:37,240
Ah, karaoke cola.

4558
06:34:39,479 --> 06:34:45,909
Quick, use them before the game ends.

4559
06:34:45,909 --> 06:34:55,959
738, they are burning.

4560
06:34:55,959 --> 06:35:00,880
It's not possible, I don't believe it.

4561
06:35:00,880 --> 06:35:23,439
I'm finished, I'm done for, oh no.

4562
06:35:23,439 --> 06:35:55,080
Come on Mario, send the last one way up.

4563
06:35:55,080 --> 06:35:57,279
His hands look like McDonald's french fries.

4564
06:35:58,159 --> 06:36:03,270
Don't ruin this, this is a very emotional part of the game.

4565
06:36:03,270 --> 06:36:15,759
All seven pieces.

4566
06:36:15,799 --> 06:36:38,540
Thank you everyone, the Star Road is back to normal, and.

4567
06:36:38,540 --> 06:37:07,240
Ah, here we go, goodbye.

4568
06:37:26,020 --> 06:37:34,540
Take care guys, you'll never fucking see me again,

4569
06:37:34,540 --> 06:37:38,340
but I hope, just please, just beg Sakurai

4570
06:37:38,340 --> 06:37:40,680
for me to be in the next game.

4571
06:37:40,680 --> 06:37:43,240
Put me in something else, please.

4572
06:37:43,240 --> 06:37:45,299
Do you see my hand cannon?

4573
06:37:45,299 --> 06:37:51,400
Do you see my finger guns and shit?

4574
06:37:51,400 --> 06:37:53,520
This is all I got.

4575
06:37:54,479 --> 06:38:16,250
Somebody please.

4576
06:38:16,250 --> 06:38:28,830
He was a cool guy, wouldn't he?

4577
06:38:28,830 --> 06:38:30,189
Oh wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,

4578
06:38:30,189 --> 06:38:31,549
this is important stuff.

4579
06:38:31,549 --> 06:38:42,409
Hooray, I am the king now.

4580
06:38:42,409 --> 06:38:45,240
Ha ha, yay.

4581
06:38:45,240 --> 06:38:48,400
You ain't ever gonna see me again either.

4582
06:38:48,400 --> 06:38:50,040
Bye, my story's complete,

4583
06:38:50,040 --> 06:38:53,119
there's no reason to keep this going ever again.

4584
06:38:53,119 --> 06:39:16,639
Story is complete though, I guess.

4585
06:39:16,639 --> 06:39:20,159
Fucking Johnny, Jonathan Jones gets more screen time

4586
06:39:20,159 --> 06:39:21,970
in the end than Gino.

4587
06:39:21,970 --> 06:39:23,569
They'll put him in Smash.

4588
06:39:23,689 --> 06:39:39,599
He'll be a fucking assist trophy next year.

4589
06:39:39,599 --> 06:39:55,180
Wait, is that implying that he poisoned Yoshi?

4590
06:39:55,180 --> 06:39:56,740
Oh, we didn't complete Todofsky,

4591
06:39:56,740 --> 06:39:58,419
there was one more song to do.

4592
06:39:58,419 --> 06:39:59,259
Oh, hello.

4593
06:40:16,680 --> 06:40:35,580
They're perfect for each other, aren't they?

4594
06:40:35,580 --> 06:40:44,400
Thank you for playing.

4595
06:40:44,400 --> 06:40:50,689
Hey guys, remember that guy that's in the green shirt?

4596
06:40:50,689 --> 06:40:54,319
Brother to the guy we played all game?

4597
06:40:54,319 --> 06:40:56,279
There he is, it's Luigi.

4598
06:41:02,290 --> 06:41:04,849
He's been running the marching band the whole game.

4599
06:41:11,729 --> 06:41:14,049
Let's go, let's go.

4600
06:41:14,049 --> 06:41:49,459
Ha ha ha, there's Malo, like get out of here.

4601
06:41:49,459 --> 06:41:53,500
Please don't make let's go a thing.

4602
06:41:53,500 --> 06:42:05,200
Why would I ever do that again?

4603
06:42:05,200 --> 06:42:08,139
It's too late.

4604
06:42:08,139 --> 06:42:10,459
Out of the blue pixel character, like Croco.

4605
06:42:27,009 --> 06:42:42,779
Bloons.

4606
06:42:42,779 --> 06:42:48,790
Is Ooster on the train, and the snippets, and the beetles.

4607
06:42:48,790 --> 06:43:03,860
I remember these guys.

4608
06:43:03,860 --> 06:43:21,759
What's at the very end of this?

4609
06:43:21,759 --> 06:43:24,509
Oh, the bosses?

4610
06:43:24,509 --> 06:43:25,549
We're gonna see Mac.

4611
06:43:29,819 --> 06:43:30,860
Yes, we are.

4612
06:43:30,860 --> 06:43:36,509
There they go, all of them.

4613
06:43:36,509 --> 06:43:39,509
Mac Yardovich, Boyer, Smithy, Blade.

4614
06:44:01,869 --> 06:44:08,299
John, and there's Gino.

4615
06:44:09,610 --> 06:44:10,889
You thought it was over?

4616
06:44:10,889 --> 06:44:11,810
You didn't think we were gonna get

4617
06:44:11,810 --> 06:44:16,729
a Magic Kingdom Disney night light-up LED parade?

4618
06:44:16,729 --> 06:44:21,049
Well, I'm sorry.

4619
06:44:21,049 --> 06:44:36,400
You were wrong.

4620
06:44:36,400 --> 06:44:38,840
This is adorable, oh, yeah, it's great.

4621
06:44:38,840 --> 06:44:39,680
It's wonderful.

4622
06:44:47,729 --> 06:44:49,689
Even the toads have glowing hats, yeah.

4623
06:44:53,750 --> 06:44:57,959
I just want this to be real.

4624
06:44:57,959 --> 06:45:02,009
Why can't it be like a Super Mario then?

4625
06:45:02,009 --> 06:45:15,990
It needs to be a Nintendo theme park.

4626
06:45:15,990 --> 06:45:18,590
It will be, yeah.

4627
06:45:32,880 --> 06:45:34,040
Goodbye, Gino.

4628
06:45:51,959 --> 06:45:54,200
Two, three, four.

4629
06:45:55,619 --> 06:45:58,180
There's the fireworks, come on, where's the finale?

4630
06:45:59,599 --> 06:46:00,759
Did I not do enough secrets?

4631
06:46:00,759 --> 06:46:02,400
I didn't do the Carbo Cubby.

4632
06:46:03,400 --> 06:46:52,119
I told you, the end.

4633
06:46:53,159 --> 06:46:54,479
It became a D.

4634
06:46:55,650 --> 06:46:57,250
Why did you do that, Gino?

4635
06:46:57,250 --> 06:46:58,849
Why did you turn yourself into a D

4636
06:46:58,849 --> 06:47:01,930
and explode when you could've been in like 15 other games?

4637
06:47:01,930 --> 06:47:03,130
Was it really worth being the D?

4638
06:47:03,130 --> 06:47:06,520
People would've got the picture, they would've understood.

4639
06:47:06,520 --> 06:47:07,360
So you panicked right there.

4640
06:47:07,360 --> 06:47:10,000
You ran at it like juice, you got to the end,

4641
06:47:10,000 --> 06:47:35,319
and you freaked out.

4642
06:47:35,319 --> 06:47:40,159
That's the end.

4643
06:47:40,159 --> 06:47:41,840
This is gonna make me cry, bro.

4644
06:47:45,270 --> 06:47:50,139
Yeah, that was Super Mario RPG.

4645
06:47:50,139 --> 06:47:52,380
That's one of my favorite games ever.

4646
06:47:52,380 --> 06:47:59,599
I am so happy to be able to play it with all of you.

4647
06:47:59,599 --> 06:48:05,590
So thank you for sharing one of my favorite things ever.

4648
06:48:05,590 --> 06:48:07,349
I'm gonna go try to do 100 jumps like twice,

4649
06:48:07,349 --> 06:48:32,119
and then I'm gonna give up, and then the string.

4650
06:48:32,119 --> 06:48:34,439
No, what the fuck did I just do?

4651
06:48:34,439 --> 06:48:36,040
Did I just open up Star Fox?

4652
06:48:50,270 --> 06:48:53,360
I'm gonna mute all sound.

4653
06:48:53,360 --> 06:48:55,869
I'm gonna take this out of my headphones,

4654
06:48:55,869 --> 06:49:04,669
and I'm gonna do it just by sight alone.

4655
06:49:05,189 --> 06:49:06,029
That's not gonna work.

4656
06:49:06,029 --> 06:49:08,930
It should, but it shouldn't.

4657
06:49:08,930 --> 06:49:09,970
Don't mute.

4658
06:49:09,970 --> 06:49:33,189
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

4659
06:49:33,189 --> 06:49:40,580
I don't even know fucking how many that was.

4660
06:49:40,580 --> 06:49:43,099
21, this shit's fucking impossible.

4661
06:49:51,299 --> 06:49:57,520
32?

4662
06:49:57,520 --> 06:50:02,200
I don't know how, how in the name of God,

4663
06:50:02,200 --> 06:50:06,740
does somebody do this 100 times in a row,

4664
06:50:06,740 --> 06:50:08,979
reliably every time?

4665
06:50:08,979 --> 06:50:09,939
I can't even imagine.

4666
06:50:09,939 --> 06:50:12,659
You've got to see the world in fucking,

4667
06:50:12,659 --> 06:50:13,500
not only do you probably,

4668
06:50:13,540 --> 06:50:15,459
you see the world in 4K,

4669
06:50:15,459 --> 06:50:26,689
and everything is slowed down by like 72%.

4670
06:50:26,689 --> 06:50:29,049
4D world, all right, hold on.

4671
06:50:29,049 --> 06:50:45,709
I'm gonna try a different tactic here.

4672
06:50:45,709 --> 06:50:46,669
It's a simple tempo.

4673
06:50:46,669 --> 06:50:49,279
It is not.

4674
06:50:49,279 --> 06:50:55,290
The timing changes to essentially a single frame

4675
06:50:56,209 --> 06:51:00,990
after, I believe, 12 jumps.

4676
06:51:00,990 --> 06:51:04,150
It is not a tempo.

4677
06:51:04,150 --> 06:51:06,509
It does not have anything to do with the sound.

4678
06:51:06,509 --> 06:51:08,470
It has nothing to do with the tempo.

4679
06:51:08,470 --> 06:51:22,099
It's about, because it changes.

4680
06:51:22,139 --> 06:51:23,340
It's the same window every time,

4681
06:51:23,340 --> 06:51:34,970
but that window is so small.

4682
06:51:34,970 --> 06:51:36,849
I'm gonna try doing it a little bit after.

4683
06:51:36,849 --> 06:51:42,029
Let's see.

4684
06:51:42,029 --> 06:51:43,069
No, you can't do it after

4685
06:51:43,069 --> 06:51:46,430
because you lose the frame data from,

4686
06:51:46,430 --> 06:51:53,549
you can't do it.

4687
06:51:53,549 --> 06:51:56,919
Just push Y.

4688
06:51:56,919 --> 06:51:59,119
Look up the YouTube tutorial.

4689
06:51:59,119 --> 06:52:11,310
I'll look it up after this.

4690
06:52:11,310 --> 06:52:19,259
Guys, poor Bowser.

4691
06:52:19,259 --> 06:52:21,020
The tutorial is useless, is it?

4692
06:52:46,729 --> 06:52:52,200
I wonder, because essentially, from my understanding,

4693
06:52:52,200 --> 06:52:55,200
right when you can see Mario's shoe,

4694
06:52:55,200 --> 06:52:57,439
right there, there, right there,

4695
06:52:57,439 --> 06:52:58,599
that's when you're supposed to press it,

4696
06:52:58,599 --> 06:53:00,959
but I feel like I'm doing it,

4697
06:53:00,959 --> 06:53:09,240
at least after you get past 15.

4698
06:53:09,240 --> 06:53:21,279
The shoe is the key.

4699
06:53:21,279 --> 06:53:28,569
Fuck.

4700
06:53:28,569 --> 06:53:34,130
I'm gonna try this like two more times.

4701
06:53:34,130 --> 06:53:37,159
I feel like the area as well,

4702
06:53:37,159 --> 06:53:49,520
like the background image adds to a problem

4703
06:53:49,520 --> 06:53:51,680
because I got to 37 against the Axum Rangers.

4704
06:53:51,680 --> 06:53:55,540
How?

4705
06:53:55,540 --> 06:53:57,099
Oh, I'm out of juice here.

4706
06:54:00,200 --> 06:54:05,330
Hold on, let me see something here.

4707
06:54:06,009 --> 06:54:11,500
I need to plug this in.

4708
06:54:11,500 --> 06:54:17,560
Let me try to get at least a 20

4709
06:54:17,560 --> 06:54:22,369
because the timing changes two times.

4710
06:54:22,369 --> 06:54:26,169
It's like the middle coming down for the first eight,

4711
06:54:26,169 --> 06:54:30,919
and then it shrinks from eight or something to 15,

4712
06:54:30,919 --> 06:54:36,540
and then it shrinks to tiny from 18 all the way up.

4713
06:54:37,810 --> 06:55:14,159
I remember looking this up years ago.

4714
06:55:14,159 --> 06:55:16,959
Make a robot that pushes the button at the exact time.

4715
06:55:18,349 --> 06:55:33,040
If I have any leftover cash, maybe.

4716
06:55:33,040 --> 06:55:35,270
All right.

4717
06:55:35,270 --> 06:55:37,990
I can say there's no chance in hell

4718
06:55:37,990 --> 06:55:42,209
I'm gonna do this 100 times on a single frame.

4719
06:55:42,209 --> 06:55:52,270
This is not gonna happen.

4720
06:55:52,270 --> 06:55:56,169
No, that attitude, oh, not ever.

4721
06:55:56,169 --> 06:55:57,770
What if I like spam it?

4722
06:55:57,770 --> 06:55:58,770
You know what I mean?

4723
06:55:58,770 --> 06:55:59,770
Does that matter?

4724
06:55:59,770 --> 06:56:08,279
Let's see what happens.

4725
06:56:08,279 --> 06:56:10,970
I'm gonna watch the tutorial.

4726
06:56:10,970 --> 06:56:19,360
I wanna see if I have this correct.

4727
06:56:19,360 --> 06:56:26,020
I'm gonna make sure I have it correct.

4728
06:56:26,060 --> 06:56:34,200
Super jump tutorial.

4729
06:56:34,200 --> 06:56:55,240
Okay, let's put it on here.

4730
06:56:55,240 --> 06:57:00,029
See it on the screen.

4731
06:57:00,029 --> 06:57:02,029
All right, super jumps.

4732
06:57:02,029 --> 06:57:03,950
I'm gonna see if I can help out

4733
06:57:03,950 --> 06:57:07,069
people having trouble getting the timing right

4734
06:57:07,069 --> 06:57:08,110
with these jumps.

4735
06:57:09,150 --> 06:57:10,950
Some people are, usually a lot of people

4736
06:57:10,950 --> 06:57:13,349
say they can't get up to phrases.

4737
06:57:13,349 --> 06:57:16,299
Get an accessory that only Mario can wear

4738
06:57:16,299 --> 06:57:19,659
is all of the super jump stats and benefits

4739
06:57:19,659 --> 06:57:21,939
as this image will attack own.

4740
06:57:32,840 --> 06:57:33,680
As far as you see,

4741
06:57:33,720 --> 06:57:35,880
at the earliest time you can press Y to jump

4742
06:57:35,880 --> 06:57:38,400
depending on how many jumps you've done so far.

4743
06:57:38,400 --> 06:57:41,240
The yellow bar is the first through about the sixth jump.

4744
06:57:41,240 --> 06:57:43,360
After the sixth jump, this timing bracket

4745
06:57:43,360 --> 06:57:46,040
will shrink down to where the orange bar is

4746
06:57:46,040 --> 06:57:49,639
which represents the seventh through about the 15th jump.

4747
06:57:49,639 --> 06:57:52,159
The orange bar is the earliest you can hit

4748
06:57:52,159 --> 06:57:54,240
the Y button at this point.

4749
06:57:54,240 --> 06:57:56,560
The red line represents the final timing change

4750
06:57:56,560 --> 06:57:57,880
that messes people up.

4751
06:57:57,880 --> 06:57:59,919
You have just a couple frames to make your mark

4752
06:57:59,919 --> 06:58:01,520
so you gotta be perfect.

4753
06:58:01,520 --> 06:58:04,080
Notice that the bars have lined up with Mario's feet

4754
06:58:04,080 --> 06:58:05,520
so the button press is occurring

4755
06:58:05,520 --> 06:58:08,000
when Mario is literally on top of enemy

4756
06:58:08,000 --> 06:58:10,479
and not right before like with the orange bar.

4757
06:58:10,479 --> 06:58:12,119
This is the first jump we're looking at

4758
06:58:12,119 --> 06:58:14,479
so I'm gonna continue the footage in slow motion

4759
06:58:14,479 --> 06:58:15,639
while counting the jumps

4760
06:58:15,639 --> 06:58:17,880
and actively showing you the timing changes.

4761
06:58:20,459 --> 06:58:22,659
Fuck, this is a lot of info.

4762
06:58:22,659 --> 06:58:24,779
Y button to see where you need to press it

4763
06:58:24,779 --> 06:58:26,380
in order to keep the jumps going.

4764
06:58:32,040 --> 06:58:37,040
Six, seven, okay, eight, nine, 11.

4765
06:58:37,799 --> 06:58:47,229
12, 13, 14, 15, 16.

4766
06:58:47,229 --> 06:58:52,529
I'm gonna go to 25 because I don't need to animate 44 jumps.

4767
06:59:04,919 --> 06:59:09,020
I feel like that's what I'm doing though, fuck.

4768
06:59:09,020 --> 06:59:17,990
All right, so after, let's see.

4769
06:59:17,990 --> 06:59:22,990
So it's one, two, three, four, five, six,

4770
06:59:24,110 --> 06:59:29,110
seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15.

4771
06:59:30,229 --> 06:59:32,549
What the fuck, I didn't change anything.

4772
07:00:11,360 --> 07:00:46,250
Six, seven, eight, damn it, man.

4773
07:00:46,250 --> 07:00:50,909
I am trying so fucking hard.

4774
07:00:50,909 --> 07:00:52,509
This shit is fucking ridiculous.

4775
07:00:55,729 --> 07:01:02,029
I also have to take into account like the delay going into,

4776
07:01:02,029 --> 07:01:04,759
you know that there, you know what?

4777
07:01:04,759 --> 07:01:07,040
That is very possible.

4778
07:01:07,040 --> 07:01:12,479
The tiny little delay going from the Super Nintendo

4779
07:01:13,040 --> 07:01:17,000
into the Elgato into my monitor.

4780
07:01:17,000 --> 07:01:20,569
Uh-oh, that's true.

4781
07:01:20,569 --> 07:01:24,310
That makes like a little bit of sense.

4782
07:01:24,310 --> 07:01:27,709
That makes sense, it does, as to why it can't be like

4783
07:01:27,709 --> 07:01:32,430
super duper ultra hyper hyper hyper perfect

4784
07:01:32,430 --> 07:01:38,459
is because of that, maybe.

4785
07:01:38,459 --> 07:01:41,340
Don't do it visually, well, you can't do it with audio.

4786
07:01:52,209 --> 07:01:54,569
Change your timing.

4787
07:01:54,569 --> 07:02:00,450
Yeah, but I'm, just change your timing forehead.

4788
07:02:00,450 --> 07:02:06,759
That doesn't work as easy as you think it does.

4789
07:02:06,759 --> 07:02:14,299
I'm losing two or three frames.

4790
07:02:14,299 --> 07:02:16,830
So that means I'd have to do it

4791
07:02:16,830 --> 07:02:20,240
like two or three frames early, right?

4792
07:02:20,240 --> 07:02:29,959
That's the theory?

4793
07:02:29,959 --> 07:02:32,319
Let me see what happens if I try to like a hair early

4794
07:02:32,319 --> 07:02:35,040
instead of trying to do it right when he lands.

4795
07:02:35,040 --> 07:02:36,459
Let's try it again.

4796
07:02:36,459 --> 07:02:59,569
All right, this is the final attempt.

4797
07:02:59,569 --> 07:03:02,459
Is the Elgato fucking screwing me up here?

4798
07:03:02,459 --> 07:03:05,419
I'm gonna, hold on, I'm going for a,

4799
07:03:05,419 --> 07:03:07,020
I'm gonna delete the game.

4800
07:03:07,020 --> 07:03:08,580
I'm gonna turn my webcam so you can see.

4801
07:03:08,580 --> 07:03:11,779
I'm going right from, I'm going from the Super Nintendo

4802
07:03:11,779 --> 07:03:14,500
right into the monitor and I'm turning my fucking camera

4803
07:03:14,500 --> 07:03:16,619
on webcam so you can see.

4804
07:03:16,619 --> 07:03:22,959
I wanna see if that helps.

4805
07:03:22,959 --> 07:03:31,000
I'm real, I'm actually curious about that

4806
07:03:31,000 --> 07:03:33,599
because I'm going, let's go out of here.

4807
07:03:33,599 --> 07:03:35,919
All right, hold on a second.

4808
07:03:35,919 --> 07:03:38,400
And you know what, the stream's over right now anyways,

4809
07:03:38,400 --> 07:03:40,819
right, like the stream's over.

4810
07:03:40,819 --> 07:03:42,099
I'll see you tomorrow.

4811
07:03:42,139 --> 07:03:47,020
Metallix and I are gonna play Man of Medan tomorrow.

4812
07:03:47,020 --> 07:03:51,299
That like horror co-op, choose who lives and choose who dies.

4813
07:03:51,299 --> 07:03:52,540
So that should be fun.

4814
07:03:52,540 --> 07:03:54,060
But let me go to the bathroom.

4815
07:03:54,060 --> 07:03:55,619
Let me come back and I'm gonna switch this up

4816
07:03:55,619 --> 07:03:58,020
and we'll do like the after stream party

4817
07:03:58,900 --> 07:04:01,340
where we do this and we'll read bits.

4818
07:04:01,340 --> 07:08:04,979
So I will see you guys very soon.

4819
07:08:04,979 --> 07:08:06,939
Why does this look like such shit?

4820
07:08:11,439 --> 07:08:16,470
Oh no, it looks all right.

4821
07:08:16,470 --> 07:08:18,470
Okay, you guys can't hear anything.

4822
07:08:18,470 --> 07:08:24,639
And neither can I.

4823
07:08:24,639 --> 07:08:27,430
What is going on?

4824
07:08:27,430 --> 07:08:34,479
Why did it just do that?

4825
07:08:34,479 --> 07:08:35,520
Why did it just do that?

4826
07:08:35,520 --> 07:08:59,319
Why does it look like this?

4827
07:08:59,319 --> 07:09:03,540
No, no, I just, I'm just incapable.

4828
07:09:03,540 --> 07:09:06,220
I'm just not, I'm just in fucking capable.

4829
07:09:06,220 --> 07:09:08,060
All right, we figured it out.

4830
07:09:08,060 --> 07:09:13,060
Just incapable of doing the 100 super jump thing.

4831
07:09:32,049 --> 07:09:37,159
Did you sit on the screen?

4832
07:09:37,159 --> 07:09:41,279
Why is this boss so fucking hard?

4833
07:09:41,319 --> 07:09:43,080
I know, I keep doing my moves to him

4834
07:09:43,080 --> 07:09:45,200
but I keep doing zero damage.

4835
07:09:52,349 --> 07:09:57,319
No, I can 100, if somebody said, Jeremy,

4836
07:09:58,439 --> 07:10:02,830
I will donate to you right now $10,000 fucking dollars

4837
07:10:02,830 --> 07:10:03,669
if you do this.

4838
07:10:03,669 --> 07:10:25,520
I wouldn't be able to do it.

4839
07:10:25,520 --> 07:10:29,599
I feel like I didn't change anything.

4840
07:10:29,599 --> 07:10:36,200
I just, it feels like my timings are getting lost somehow.

4841
07:10:36,200 --> 07:11:05,349
It's the last attempt and I'm out of here.

4842
07:11:05,349 --> 07:11:27,310
Ooh, that was fucking pretty good.

4843
07:11:27,310 --> 07:11:31,110
So what I started doing there is I started to press Y

4844
07:11:31,110 --> 07:11:39,479
right as I was touching the top of his bulbous head there.

4845
07:11:39,479 --> 07:11:41,479
Like right when I started to graze the top of his head

4846
07:11:41,479 --> 07:11:44,229
as I'm when I'm pressing Y.

4847
07:11:44,229 --> 07:12:31,900
Oh, fuck.

4848
07:12:31,900 --> 07:12:33,259
I had to itch my fucking face.

4849
07:12:33,259 --> 07:12:55,720
Turn it off.

4850
07:12:55,720 --> 07:13:00,720
20, 21, 22, three, 34, five, 36, 37, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34,

4851
07:13:06,659 --> 07:13:38,119
35, 36, 37, 38, 39, fuck.

4852
07:13:38,279 --> 07:13:44,840
I gotta do this 50 more goddamn times.

4853
07:13:44,840 --> 07:13:45,680
You know what I'm gonna do?

4854
07:13:45,680 --> 07:13:52,659
I'm gonna press start like now, you know what I'm saying?

4855
07:13:52,659 --> 07:14:01,369
Let's see, if I get up to 75, I'll do it.

4856
07:14:01,369 --> 07:14:05,159
I'm gonna stop it at about like three seconds left.

4857
07:14:05,159 --> 07:14:23,810
I'm gonna try to get it on the way up, not the way down.

4858
07:14:23,810 --> 07:14:25,650
Fuck, no.

4859
07:14:25,650 --> 07:14:31,779
How many was that?

4860
07:14:31,779 --> 07:14:40,029
Was that 60?

4861
07:14:40,029 --> 07:14:40,869
All right, same thing.

4862
07:14:40,869 --> 07:14:46,500
I'm gonna stop it about three seconds, four seconds.

4863
07:14:46,500 --> 07:14:48,639
Why does this look so fucking stupid?

4864
07:14:52,889 --> 07:15:06,119
Why does it look like that?

4865
07:15:06,119 --> 07:15:17,849
All right, here we go.

4866
07:15:17,849 --> 07:15:20,450
Oh, I'm gonna lose my fucking mind.

4867
07:15:20,450 --> 07:15:22,209
I'm gonna lose my fucking mind.

4868
07:15:26,250 --> 07:15:49,029
I'm at like 60.

4869
07:15:49,029 --> 07:15:50,950
It's the viewing angles on my monitor.

4870
07:15:50,950 --> 07:15:52,729
Well, hold on.

4871
07:15:54,259 --> 07:15:57,599
Put the webcam on top of my head, but then I can't focus.

4872
07:16:09,720 --> 07:16:12,080
That's, it's so hard to fucking do that.

4873
07:16:12,080 --> 07:16:14,159
It's so hard to get that like exact frame

4874
07:16:14,159 --> 07:16:15,880
like going off, down, go.

4875
07:16:15,880 --> 07:16:20,310
Oh my God, I'm gonna scream.

4876
07:16:20,310 --> 07:16:29,159
What the hell is this?

4877
07:16:30,040 --> 07:16:42,130
Where am I?

4878
07:16:42,130 --> 07:16:48,080
No, that doesn't even help.

4879
07:16:48,080 --> 07:16:55,950
I can't put this anywhere.

4880
07:16:55,950 --> 07:17:11,340
All right, I'm gonna hold it in my fucking mouth after this.

4881
07:17:11,340 --> 07:17:18,049
My stream off?

4882
07:17:18,049 --> 07:17:24,680
Can you guys hear me?

4883
07:17:24,680 --> 07:17:50,669
Why can I see the chat?

4884
07:17:50,669 --> 07:18:39,459
What the fuck is going on?

4885
07:18:39,459 --> 07:18:50,840
Hello, what the hell was that?

4886
07:18:50,840 --> 07:18:53,330
I have to give up.

4887
07:18:53,330 --> 07:19:07,200
No, I think everything's up.

4888
07:19:07,200 --> 07:19:14,520
Hello, what the fuck is happening?

4889
07:19:14,520 --> 07:19:18,049
What is going on right now?

4890
07:19:18,049 --> 07:19:20,669
This is going in and out so fast,

4891
07:19:20,669 --> 07:19:22,049
but my internet's not turning off.

4892
07:19:22,610 --> 07:19:45,990
I think this is like an OBS or a Twitch issue.

4893
07:19:45,990 --> 07:19:48,060
Damn it.

4894
07:19:48,060 --> 07:19:49,500
I don't even know how much that is.

4895
07:19:49,500 --> 07:19:53,509
I think I'm at like 78.

4896
07:19:53,509 --> 07:20:39,360
I'm at 78 or something.

4897
07:20:39,360 --> 07:20:49,709
Okay, here we go.

4898
07:20:49,709 --> 07:20:50,950
It's the second one.

4899
07:20:54,659 --> 07:20:56,279
I can get the fucking first one,

4900
07:20:56,279 --> 07:21:21,380
but the second one just sucks.

4901
07:21:21,380 --> 07:21:24,360
This viewing angle is so bad.

4902
07:21:24,360 --> 07:21:34,790
I can't, I'm gonna go into like the camera setting.

4903
07:21:40,959 --> 07:21:51,930
I gotta, if I don't get 10 each time I do this,

4904
07:21:52,770 --> 07:21:54,650
why, oh, I wasn't paying attention.

4905
07:21:54,650 --> 07:21:55,610
I'm done, I'm out of here.

4906
07:21:55,610 --> 07:21:56,729
I'm fucking leaving.

4907
07:21:56,729 --> 07:22:01,659
I'm not doing this again.

4908
07:22:01,659 --> 07:22:02,500
This is too much.

4909
07:22:02,500 --> 07:22:07,610
This is too much actual like living pain.

4910
07:22:07,610 --> 07:22:18,549
Trying to spring into a hundred of these fucking things.

4911
07:22:18,549 --> 07:22:22,189
I'm too close, but it's so, so hard to do,

4912
07:22:22,189 --> 07:22:27,060
but the stupid way that I'm trying to do this.

4913
07:22:27,060 --> 07:22:33,330
Oh, you can't even see it, nevermind.

4914
07:22:33,330 --> 07:22:35,729
I have, if I don't come within like 15,

4915
07:22:35,729 --> 07:22:39,549
I don't even know how many I've done.

4916
07:22:39,549 --> 07:22:40,669
I can see you shirtless.

4917
07:22:40,669 --> 07:22:53,119
No, I'm not shirtless, I got clothes on.

4918
07:22:53,159 --> 07:22:57,590
All right, here we go.

4919
07:22:57,590 --> 07:24:03,240
Oh my, can you guys not hear me?

4920
07:24:03,240 --> 07:24:05,889
Oh shit, I was muted that whole time, I think.

4921
07:24:05,889 --> 07:24:07,409
I'm sorry, I've been talking for like

4922
07:24:07,409 --> 07:24:11,229
at least a full minute, two minutes.

4923
07:24:11,229 --> 07:24:15,240
Wait, was it, I wasn't muted, I was muted?

4924
07:24:15,240 --> 07:24:16,580
I'm not still playing.

4925
07:24:16,580 --> 07:24:20,270
Oh my God, I was just talking for so long.

4926
07:24:20,270 --> 07:24:26,990
All right, so that was Mario RPG.

4927
07:24:26,990 --> 07:24:30,720
Thanks for watching, I'm gonna do the bits.

4928
07:24:30,720 --> 07:24:33,400
Shouldn't take us too long because we didn't have,

4929
07:24:34,240 --> 07:24:35,799
I don't think this will take us more than 20,

4930
07:24:35,799 --> 07:24:39,619
30 minutes or so.

4931
07:24:39,619 --> 07:24:42,540
I wouldn't tell anyone if you use GameShark, it's all good.

4932
07:24:42,540 --> 07:24:45,819
Hey, Sticks Renegade, thanks for the 250.

4933
07:24:45,819 --> 07:24:47,340
Here's an update to that sticker car

4934
07:24:47,340 --> 07:24:52,259
I showed you a month or two ago.

4935
07:24:52,259 --> 07:25:04,060
Oh, your sticker car, Jesus.

4936
07:25:04,060 --> 07:25:18,779
What if you even need to repaint the car?

4937
07:25:18,779 --> 07:25:21,220
When are you gonna do another jumping session here?

4938
07:25:21,220 --> 07:25:22,740
I'll show you.

4939
07:25:22,740 --> 07:25:26,759
But thank you for the $5, Sticks Renegade.

4940
07:25:26,759 --> 07:25:33,580
We'll show your bumper sticker car.

4941
07:25:33,619 --> 07:25:53,659
You got a lot of angles here too.

4942
07:25:53,659 --> 07:26:00,369
So what, you added stuff on the front here?

4943
07:26:00,369 --> 07:26:03,990
This is like mini NASCAR.

4944
07:26:03,990 --> 07:26:22,740
Holy shit, is this too many?

4945
07:26:22,740 --> 07:26:26,880
Is this too, I mean, yeah, I think it is.

4946
07:26:26,880 --> 07:26:36,150
I think that's too many, never too many.

4947
07:26:36,150 --> 07:26:41,090
Where's the German 985 sticker, what the heck man?

4948
07:26:41,090 --> 07:26:45,439
Thank you, and good luck with your soon

4949
07:26:45,439 --> 07:26:54,799
to be potential polka dot car.

4950
07:26:54,799 --> 07:26:58,830
Thank you to Drummage Door for the 250.

4951
07:26:58,830 --> 07:27:01,430
Now you might be experiencing RPG fatigue,

4952
07:27:01,430 --> 07:27:02,630
but since you enjoyed this so much,

4953
07:27:02,630 --> 07:27:06,229
you might wanna check out Barkley Shut Up and Jam.

4954
07:27:06,229 --> 07:27:11,169
It's a free humoristic post-apocalyptic basketball RPG.

4955
07:27:11,169 --> 07:27:14,950
You can play it even if you don't know much about basketball.

4956
07:27:14,950 --> 07:27:17,029
I have heard of that game,

4957
07:27:19,750 --> 07:27:23,919
but I think we're gonna be away from RPG games

4958
07:27:23,919 --> 07:27:27,700
for a little bit, just for a little while,

4959
07:27:27,700 --> 07:27:30,990
because this was three streams in a row.

4960
07:27:30,990 --> 07:27:33,950
So I wanna take a break from role playing games

4961
07:27:34,830 --> 07:27:35,750
while we do some other stuff.

4962
07:27:35,750 --> 07:27:42,659
The old I'll look into it, yeah.

4963
07:27:42,659 --> 07:27:49,540
But thank you, hold on, I got some chest burps.

4964
07:27:49,540 --> 07:27:53,380
PS, you won't play Lisa RPG, you uncultured brute.

4965
07:27:53,380 --> 07:27:58,819
I don't think I will, not on stream.

4966
07:27:58,819 --> 07:28:01,139
But thank you to Gunther for the $5.10.

4967
07:28:01,139 --> 07:28:04,169
Here's to September, thank you.

4968
07:28:04,169 --> 07:28:08,849
Thanks for the $5.10, thanks for your subscription.

4969
07:28:08,849 --> 07:28:12,659
Yeah, you did twice, $5.10.

4970
07:28:12,659 --> 07:28:15,810
And anonymous cheer, thanks to the 250.

4971
07:28:16,569 --> 07:28:17,889
They don't say anything, just anonymous.

4972
07:28:17,889 --> 07:28:24,680
And they cheered, $2.50.

4973
07:28:24,680 --> 07:28:29,599
Thank you to Halo Softboy for the $2.49.

4974
07:28:29,599 --> 07:28:32,380
I'm not supposed to be reading this one.

4975
07:28:32,380 --> 07:28:39,740
Excuse me, you're breaking the rule here.

4976
07:28:39,740 --> 07:28:46,860
I saw the two and I saw, uh-oh.

4977
07:28:46,860 --> 07:28:49,459
But I mean, I'm already here.

4978
07:28:49,459 --> 07:28:50,500
Jerma for screenwriting,

4979
07:28:50,500 --> 07:28:52,500
I'm interested in alchemy as a visual language.

4980
07:28:52,500 --> 07:28:54,380
In the dreams you shared,

4981
07:28:54,380 --> 07:28:57,020
the progression of meteors to vials of pee

4982
07:28:57,020 --> 07:28:59,459
to blacksmith imagery is neat.

4983
07:28:59,459 --> 07:29:01,740
Alchemists believe they could distill the powers

4984
07:29:01,740 --> 07:29:04,419
of celestial bodies into liquid tinctures

4985
07:29:04,419 --> 07:29:10,340
to be used in forging the philosopher's stone.

4986
07:29:10,340 --> 07:29:25,220
So what you're saying is, that was your 500 IQ dream.

4987
07:29:25,220 --> 07:29:27,659
You're heading to Vegas tomorrow, I need advice.

4988
07:29:27,659 --> 07:29:29,580
Don't spend a lot of money.

4989
07:29:29,580 --> 07:29:32,500
Eat at hash house or go on the link.

4990
07:29:32,500 --> 07:29:40,770
And don't stay up too late, take it slow.

4991
07:29:40,770 --> 07:29:41,930
But thank you Halo Softboy

4992
07:29:41,930 --> 07:29:48,680
for that good dream interpretation.

4993
07:29:48,720 --> 07:29:53,720
Thank you Zion S-A-W-S-D, Zion Swayze.

4994
07:29:54,479 --> 07:29:55,720
Thanks for the 10 bucks.

4995
07:29:55,720 --> 07:29:57,360
Jerma, why are you in the first edition

4996
07:29:57,360 --> 07:30:01,200
Dungeons and Dragons Fiend Folo from 1981?

4997
07:30:01,200 --> 07:30:03,040
The one on the right even looks like you.

4998
07:30:03,040 --> 07:30:07,709
How ancient, how ancient are you?

4999
07:30:07,709 --> 07:30:14,119
Oh, this is like a germ.

5000
07:30:14,119 --> 07:30:23,200
It's like a goblin or something.

5001
07:30:23,200 --> 07:30:27,240
This is the first edition D&D.

5002
07:30:27,240 --> 07:30:31,529
The one on the right looks like me.

5003
07:30:31,529 --> 07:30:39,630
And it's a germ, a germ lane.

5004
07:30:40,830 --> 07:30:43,270
I mean, that is kind of the way my head is shaped.

5005
07:30:43,270 --> 07:30:44,669
My ears don't look like that though.

5006
07:30:44,669 --> 07:30:45,830
I got better teeth than that.

5007
07:30:45,830 --> 07:30:47,709
My nose is a little more crooked.

5008
07:30:47,709 --> 07:30:49,950
And I got a nice full, I got a fuller jaw than that.

5009
07:30:49,950 --> 07:30:54,650
But I do see what you're saying.

5010
07:30:54,650 --> 07:30:56,209
But thank you for the 10 bucks.

5011
07:30:56,209 --> 07:30:58,169
Thank you Seven Layer Wario for the five dollars.

5012
07:30:58,169 --> 07:31:01,409
Hey, would you say happy birthday to my partner Wes?

5013
07:31:01,409 --> 07:31:03,810
Happy birthday Wes, if you get this.

5014
07:31:03,810 --> 07:31:07,290
Probably birthday is potentially day after birthday,

5015
07:31:07,290 --> 07:31:09,330
but happy birthday yesterday.

5016
07:31:09,330 --> 07:31:11,950
Hope you had a good one Wes.

5017
07:31:11,990 --> 07:31:17,750
And thank you to Seven Layer Wario for the five dollars.

5018
07:31:17,750 --> 07:31:18,950
Hey Garfield, the Monday Killer,

5019
07:31:18,950 --> 07:31:21,150
thanks for the 250 Garfield.

5020
07:31:21,150 --> 07:31:22,270
Germ, guess whose birthday it is.

5021
07:31:22,270 --> 07:31:23,630
It's Garfield's birthday today.

5022
07:31:23,630 --> 07:31:26,340
The real one or the yours?

5023
07:31:26,340 --> 07:31:29,580
The comics say it's June 19th, but that's just one off.

5024
07:31:29,580 --> 07:31:31,819
That's just one of Jim Davis's funny goof ups.

5025
07:31:31,819 --> 07:31:34,580
He got it wrong 41 years in a row somehow.

5026
07:31:34,580 --> 07:31:35,779
Oh, that's interesting.

5027
07:31:37,110 --> 07:31:39,389
Anyway, Germ, as a birthday Garfagraph,

5028
07:31:39,389 --> 07:31:41,549
can you sing a rat birthday song?

5029
07:31:41,549 --> 07:31:43,950
Germ, a one guy or maybe just a regular birthday song,

5030
07:31:43,950 --> 07:31:48,619
maybe an original.

5031
07:31:48,619 --> 07:31:51,549
I ain't gonna sing the birthday rat song.

5032
07:31:51,549 --> 07:31:55,209
I will say happy birthday to Garfield.

5033
07:31:55,209 --> 07:31:57,950
What a swell guy.

5034
07:31:57,950 --> 07:32:04,240
Happy birthday to Garfield, whether it's cake or pie.

5035
07:32:04,240 --> 07:32:12,840
Happy birthday to Garfield, we owe you much.

5036
07:32:12,840 --> 07:32:15,669
Happy birthday to Garfield.

5037
07:32:15,669 --> 07:32:22,810
Coming in in the clutch, happy birthday.

5038
07:32:22,810 --> 07:32:32,259
Thank you Ryan the Giant for the 10 bucks, thousand bits.

5039
07:32:32,259 --> 07:32:36,700
Say they said Oswald Fattenswild from the Gallup Gazette.

5040
07:32:36,700 --> 07:32:38,819
Can you tell us how today's stream is going to affect

5041
07:32:38,860 --> 07:32:40,060
the rest of your season?

5042
07:32:44,740 --> 07:32:46,180
Well, I didn't do the 100 jump.

5043
07:32:46,180 --> 07:32:50,939
I didn't do the 100 Mario super jumps.

5044
07:32:50,939 --> 07:32:52,340
So I think that's gonna negatively affect me

5045
07:32:52,340 --> 07:32:54,419
in the short term.

5046
07:32:54,419 --> 07:33:04,919
But in the mid to long term, I think we're gonna be just fine.

5047
07:33:04,919 --> 07:33:06,720
Hey, Wiki, this thanks with three bucks.

5048
07:33:06,720 --> 07:33:12,290
Oh boy, we're riding the Royal Bus, where we dropping?

5049
07:33:12,290 --> 07:33:13,569
I've read that.

5050
07:33:13,569 --> 07:33:16,009
Thank you Wolfgang for the $5.

5051
07:33:16,009 --> 07:33:18,090
Ex-vacation better be in the next term of Rumbler,

5052
07:33:18,090 --> 07:33:22,779
I swear I will cause a massive riot.

5053
07:33:22,819 --> 07:33:24,139
Probably.

5054
07:33:24,139 --> 07:33:29,750
That's gonna happen before the end of the year.

5055
07:33:29,750 --> 07:33:32,630
There were an insane amount of subs tonight.

5056
07:33:32,630 --> 07:33:35,590
Insane, insane, insane.

5057
07:33:35,590 --> 07:33:38,509
They were probably at least two, three or 400 subs tonight

5058
07:33:38,509 --> 07:33:41,229
with community subs involved too.

5059
07:33:41,229 --> 07:33:45,349
Is September actually causing a big sub explosion here?

5060
07:33:51,340 --> 07:34:01,180
Let's take a look at how many.

5061
07:34:01,180 --> 07:34:05,830
Yeah.

5062
07:34:05,830 --> 07:34:09,240
Oh, didn't the stream turn off?

5063
07:34:09,240 --> 07:34:12,119
The stream did, the stream turned off.

5064
07:34:12,119 --> 07:34:15,500
Remember like 20, what an hour ago or so?

5065
07:34:15,500 --> 07:34:16,900
Was it an hour, two hours ago?

5066
07:34:16,900 --> 07:34:20,720
It went to like zero.

5067
07:34:20,720 --> 07:34:26,860
We might have lost a few.

5068
07:34:26,860 --> 07:34:28,659
Yeah, cause this is like just the subs

5069
07:34:28,659 --> 07:34:32,279
from the current live stream.

5070
07:34:32,279 --> 07:34:33,919
Did it stay on?

5071
07:34:33,919 --> 07:34:35,979
Oh, okay.

5072
07:34:35,979 --> 07:34:37,099
Was that five minutes ago?

5073
07:34:37,099 --> 07:34:40,959
Was it five minutes ago?

5074
07:34:40,959 --> 07:34:41,799
But still, it's a lot.

5075
07:34:41,799 --> 07:34:45,500
And I mean, I can look over and see the subscriptions.

5076
07:34:45,500 --> 07:34:49,790
This is a shit load.

5077
07:34:49,790 --> 07:34:56,520
But thank you all of you.

5078
07:34:56,520 --> 07:34:57,439
Thank you for subscribing.

5079
07:34:57,439 --> 07:34:59,340
I'll see you tomorrow.

5080
07:34:59,340 --> 07:35:03,470
We're gonna do Man of Badan, the horror game.

5081
07:35:03,470 --> 07:35:07,209
It's sort of just a one and done experience.

5082
07:35:07,209 --> 07:35:10,139
We'll go.

5083
07:35:10,139 --> 07:35:11,619
But thank you snoozingcopter for the 250.

5084
07:35:11,619 --> 07:35:16,549
Some streamers just want to watch the chat burn.

5085
07:35:16,549 --> 07:35:20,290
No, I want to watch my chat flourish.

5086
07:35:20,290 --> 07:35:22,130
Hey Gunther, thanks for the $5.

5087
07:35:22,130 --> 07:35:24,970
What is Yardovich 2's favorite flavor of gum?

5088
07:35:24,970 --> 07:35:27,110
Double mint.

5089
07:35:27,110 --> 07:35:28,229
That's pretty good.

5090
07:35:28,229 --> 07:35:30,509
You're coming up with these on the fly here.

5091
07:35:30,509 --> 07:35:32,509
Also thank you to Joel for the raid.

5092
07:35:32,509 --> 07:35:33,830
I don't know if anybody's still here from that,

5093
07:35:33,830 --> 07:35:35,909
but it is very late.

5094
07:35:35,909 --> 07:35:41,279
But thanks a lot.

5095
07:35:41,279 --> 07:35:42,799
Thanks everybody that was watching Joel's stream

5096
07:35:42,799 --> 07:35:47,400
for sticking around for as long as you did.

5097
07:35:47,400 --> 07:35:51,119
Maybe we'll see you again.

5098
07:35:51,119 --> 07:35:55,500
Also, Phylactery Lich.

5099
07:35:55,500 --> 07:35:59,430
50 more dollars from Phylactery Lich.

5100
07:35:59,430 --> 07:36:02,830
Loading up a huge amount of money.

5101
07:36:02,830 --> 07:36:05,630
Still, weeks later.

5102
07:36:05,630 --> 07:36:08,389
Phylactery is still giving insane amounts of money.

5103
07:36:10,659 --> 07:36:11,860
They say, what a wholesome stream, Jerma.

5104
07:36:11,860 --> 07:36:12,740
Thanks for the adventure.

5105
07:36:12,740 --> 07:36:18,020
Now for the love of God, play Paper Mario 1 and 2.

5106
07:36:18,020 --> 07:36:20,299
Judging by how many people,

5107
07:36:20,299 --> 07:36:21,139
because here's the thing,

5108
07:36:21,139 --> 07:36:21,979
this is kind of testing the waters.

5109
07:36:21,979 --> 07:36:23,830
I said this the other day.

5110
07:36:23,830 --> 07:36:31,790
But I, me, I sometimes think,

5111
07:36:32,310 --> 07:36:34,189
oh, is that too slow?

5112
07:36:34,189 --> 07:36:39,189
Is doing like a RPG stream too not interesting to people?

5113
07:36:39,630 --> 07:36:41,470
Is that, you know, three streams,

5114
07:36:41,470 --> 07:36:44,310
four streams of turn-based combat?

5115
07:36:44,310 --> 07:36:47,709
And I kind of get in my own head and go,

5116
07:36:47,709 --> 07:36:48,869
I don't think people are gonna like that.

5117
07:36:48,869 --> 07:36:49,709
It's boring.

5118
07:36:49,709 --> 07:36:50,549
Is it boring?

5119
07:36:50,549 --> 07:36:51,369
It is boring.

5120
07:36:51,369 --> 07:36:52,209
Jeremy, is that boring?

5121
07:36:52,209 --> 07:36:53,049
I think it is.

5122
07:36:53,049 --> 07:36:53,869
No, it's not.

5123
07:36:53,869 --> 07:36:55,020
I think maybe somebody would like it.

5124
07:36:55,020 --> 07:36:56,419
So this was a test to see.

5125
07:36:56,419 --> 07:36:59,259
And it looks like this went great.

5126
07:36:59,259 --> 07:37:05,000
This went really, really well.

5127
07:37:05,000 --> 07:37:10,299
So I'm just judging by how many people

5128
07:37:10,299 --> 07:37:12,060
were happy with the game

5129
07:37:12,060 --> 07:37:15,299
and thought that this was a good string of streams.

5130
07:37:15,299 --> 07:37:16,380
My concern was always,

5131
07:37:16,380 --> 07:37:17,700
is it gonna get a little too draggy,

5132
07:37:17,700 --> 07:37:18,659
a little too boring for people?

5133
07:37:18,659 --> 07:37:20,580
But maybe it did for some.

5134
07:37:22,419 --> 07:37:24,380
So I probably will continue to do some of these other games,

5135
07:37:24,380 --> 07:37:25,680
but not immediately.

5136
07:37:26,580 --> 07:37:34,360
There's a lot of things I wanna do in the meantime.

5137
07:37:34,360 --> 07:37:37,200
I'm glad that people enjoyed them.

5138
07:37:37,200 --> 07:37:38,680
People thought they were fun.

5139
07:37:38,680 --> 07:37:42,279
Because I love this game,

5140
07:37:42,279 --> 07:37:44,159
except for the 100 jumps.

5141
07:37:44,159 --> 07:37:45,200
But I already admitted

5142
07:37:45,200 --> 07:37:47,240
that I wasn't gonna be able to do that.

5143
07:37:47,240 --> 07:37:50,279
And I tried to time travel and do it.

5144
07:37:50,279 --> 07:37:51,200
Still couldn't do it.

5145
07:37:51,200 --> 07:37:52,040
You know what?

5146
07:37:52,040 --> 07:37:54,540
You have to admit when you're incapable of doing something.

5147
07:37:54,540 --> 07:37:55,580
But that's my time.

5148
07:37:57,779 --> 07:37:59,259
I will see you guys tomorrow.

5149
07:37:59,259 --> 07:38:00,180
And right at the very end,

5150
07:38:00,180 --> 07:38:03,139
Sweenex gave $5 right at the very end here.

5151
07:38:03,139 --> 07:38:04,419
Thank you, Sweenex.

5152
07:38:04,419 --> 07:38:05,259
They say, hey Jeremy,

5153
07:38:05,259 --> 07:38:06,080
I just wanted to thank you

5154
07:38:06,080 --> 07:38:08,259
because recently I lost my job as an art director.

5155
07:38:08,259 --> 07:38:09,419
I've had for some time

5156
07:38:09,419 --> 07:38:12,779
due to the department I work for filing for bankruptcy.

5157
07:38:12,779 --> 07:38:15,340
I'm really sorry to hear that.

5158
07:38:15,340 --> 07:38:18,319
I was watching your Xbox camera green screen stream

5159
07:38:18,319 --> 07:38:19,459
when it happened.

5160
07:38:19,459 --> 07:38:22,860
Watching you in that fat suit cheered me up in a lot,

5161
07:38:22,860 --> 07:38:31,569
cheered me up a lot, as stupid as it sounds.

5162
07:38:31,569 --> 07:38:36,430
I can't imagine having a long-term career

5163
07:38:36,430 --> 07:38:38,520
that you've had for a while

5164
07:38:38,520 --> 07:38:41,479
that because of a company's bankruptcy

5165
07:38:41,479 --> 07:38:43,639
or insolvency or something,

5166
07:38:43,639 --> 07:38:45,580
it's just kind of, that's it.

5167
07:38:45,580 --> 07:38:47,840
I'm really, really sorry to hear that.

5168
07:38:47,840 --> 07:38:49,840
Hopefully you can find something else in the field

5169
07:38:49,840 --> 07:38:52,919
that you can quickly turn back around.

5170
07:38:52,919 --> 07:38:55,439
Seems like if you had that much experience,

5171
07:38:55,439 --> 07:38:56,560
it shouldn't be that hard.

5172
07:38:56,560 --> 07:38:57,400
Hopefully not.

5173
07:38:59,700 --> 07:39:03,470
But seriously, anything that can make you happy

5174
07:39:03,470 --> 07:39:06,189
or anything that can cheer you up on these streams is,

5175
07:39:06,189 --> 07:39:12,500
that means way more to me than anything else.

5176
07:39:12,500 --> 07:39:16,869
Good luck to you.

5177
07:39:16,869 --> 07:39:19,919
I'll see you guys tomorrow.

5178
07:39:19,919 --> 07:39:22,340
To Alex and I are gonna play a man of a damn.

5179
07:39:22,340 --> 07:39:23,759
Good night.

5180
07:39:23,759 --> 07:39:26,119
Take care, everybody.

5181
07:39:26,119 --> 07:39:28,159
See you real soon.

5182
07:39:28,159 --> 07:39:29,000
Ta-ta.
