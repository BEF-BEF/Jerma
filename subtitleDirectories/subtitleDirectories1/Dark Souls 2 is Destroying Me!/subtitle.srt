1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:18,760
Like, seriously. My guy right now looks like a rubber mask. He looks like he's wearing a Halloween mask.

2
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:24,440
Who's that guy? It's a big fat guy.

3
00:00:26,129 --> 00:00:32,259
What? I d- I d-

4
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:37,560
Well, no, no, no, I just- I dropped in the water. You're telling me that, like, I- what am I, made out of cinder blocks?

5
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,560
And I just sank to the bottom of the ocean?

6
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:42,820
That wasn't that far of a jump.

7
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:46,130
I feel like I've jumped in water way higher than that, and it was totally fine.

8
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:48,130
Are you- are you shitting me right now?

9
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:53,880
No, no, no, you just sank to the bottom. Your character weighs 15,000 pounds.

10
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:57,659
What the fuck is wrong with me?

11
00:00:57,659 --> 00:01:01,979
Alright, now I- now I'm like a shredder.

12
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:03,979
I just turned into a shredder from Ninja Turtles.

13
00:01:03,979 --> 00:01:05,980
This is the awesome best game I've ever made.

14
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:10,890
Praise the sun, by the way. Are you ready?

15
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:12,890
Apparently- I guess something's happening up here.

16
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:20,140
Bright spot ahead. Look out. Be wary of gorgeous view.

17
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:22,379
Okay, alright.

18
00:01:22,379 --> 00:01:25,329
Light ahead.

19
00:01:25,329 --> 00:01:28,329
Hurrah for gorgeous view, but be wary of hope.

20
00:01:28,329 --> 00:01:33,379
Are these fortune cookies?

21
00:01:33,379 --> 00:01:36,379
I'm gonna keep doing what I'm doing, and I'm gonna get the kill.

22
00:01:36,379 --> 00:01:39,459
Okay, one of your cronies is behind me now.

23
00:01:39,459 --> 00:01:41,890
This is not good.

24
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:44,700
Now I got two of you assholes to deal with.

25
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:48,799
You're gonna fuck this up for me.

26
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,450
Holy hell.

27
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:57,420
This is taking- it's taking so long.

28
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:00,170
Welcome to Dark Souls 2.

29
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:02,469
The hardest game ever.

30
00:02:02,469 --> 00:02:05,480
Bang. See you later.

31
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,480
See you later. Where's my money?

32
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:10,229
Where's my cash?

33
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:12,229
Night sword. I got a night sword.

34
00:02:12,229 --> 00:02:17,219
I did it.

35
00:02:17,219 --> 00:02:20,590
I completed it. I killed the boss.

36
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:22,590
And here's the boss song.

37
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:28,590
No, no, don't die. I can't die here.

38
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:31,599
I seriously cannot die here.

39
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:34,159
How do I climb down?

40
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:36,159
I was singing the fucking boss song.

41
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:38,530
Don't freak out. Don't freak out.

42
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:40,530
Don't freak out.

43
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:42,530
Okay. Chill.

44
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:44,530
Chill.

45
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:48,560
My brain.

46
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,759
This is my shield?

47
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:54,379
This is the shield I just put on?

48
00:02:54,379 --> 00:02:56,689
This isn't gonna block a sword?

49
00:02:56,689 --> 00:02:59,949
This is not gonna block a sword.

50
00:02:59,949 --> 00:03:05,330
Are you fucking serious?

51
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:10,000
It's just a little baby shield.

52
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,780
Screw you.

53
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:15,780
My baby shield is better than your giant sword.

54
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:19,550
Walk onto him, you dingus.

55
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:25,819
Yeah.

56
00:03:25,819 --> 00:03:27,819
You don't get a baby shield protecting your ass.

57
00:03:27,819 --> 00:03:37,020
Baby shield.

58
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:39,020
What an unbelievable item.

59
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:43,169
Seriously.

60
00:03:43,169 --> 00:03:46,370
You think you could fuck with the baby shield?

61
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:48,370
You know, I could make the joke right now.

62
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:50,370
I really could do it.

63
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:52,370
And I think I'm going to.

64
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:54,370
I've been saying I look like the shredder this whole time.

65
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:56,370
Well, this is legit a fat ninja turtle.

66
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:59,060
We're about to see the epic showdown

67
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:01,060
between huge fat Michelangelo

68
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:03,060
who really let himself go eating too many pizzas with pepperoni.

69
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:05,680
And, holy god,

70
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,680
he almost just insta-killed me.

71
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,680
Hopefully he doesn't do that.

72
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:16,589
Well, this is an interesting fight.

73
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:19,660
Kind of like who falls off first.

74
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,660
Can I push him off?

75
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:25,759
Are you seriously kidding me right now?

76
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:28,699
Let's see how you died.

77
00:04:28,699 --> 00:04:31,199
That's a pretty big sword.

78
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:34,269
Of course he did.

79
00:04:34,269 --> 00:04:37,730
Of course that's how he died.

80
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:39,730
I feel for these people.

81
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:42,029
What was that guy doing though?

82
00:04:42,029 --> 00:04:46,129
What was that guy...

83
00:04:46,129 --> 00:04:48,129
Is this seriously how like all people die in this game?

84
00:04:48,129 --> 00:04:51,009
I mean, I've done it a bunch of times too.

85
00:04:51,009 --> 00:04:53,009
I've done it a bunch of times too.

86
00:04:53,009 --> 00:04:55,439
Like, this is how everybody dies.

87
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:57,439
Monsters don't kill you in Dark Souls.

88
00:04:57,439 --> 00:05:00,959
You just walk off cliffs.

89
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:03,199
Got the fire arrows.

90
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:05,699
His like butthole face cannot scare me.

91
00:05:05,699 --> 00:05:07,699
You think you're going to scare me with your butthole face?

92
00:05:07,699 --> 00:05:12,240
Oh, geez.

93
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,240
What is he doing?

94
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,310
I didn't get hit.

95
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:23,389
How did I not get hit? What a miracle.

96
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:27,810
Watch out. Don't let him stop on you.

97
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:29,810
Good. We're in good shape.

98
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:34,079
Through the legs.

99
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:36,079
You goddamn giant.

100
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:39,790
Not that bad. Not that bad.

101
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:42,100
We're okay. We're okay.

102
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:44,100
Of course when he does like the stupid super jump backwards

103
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:46,100
that's not okay.

104
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:52,689
Fuck me.

105
00:05:52,689 --> 00:05:54,689
Drink the goddamn apple juice.

106
00:05:54,689 --> 00:05:56,990
Drink the apple juice.

107
00:05:56,990 --> 00:06:01,149
Don't let him do it again.

108
00:06:01,149 --> 00:06:04,540
Yeah.

109
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:06,720
One more hit. One more hit.

110
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,720
I am

111
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,720
the Dark Souls 2

112
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,279
master.

113
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:15,279
The last giant and the soldier key.

114
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:18,160
You can thank this grandma

115
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,660
faced fuck for saving the day.

116
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:25,250
Alright, this is going to say

117
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:29,579
uh, up?

118
00:06:29,579 --> 00:06:31,579
Up?

119
00:06:31,579 --> 00:06:33,579
My message to the world at this

120
00:06:33,579 --> 00:06:35,889
boss is up?

121
00:06:35,889 --> 00:06:39,470
He's like yeah, yeah, let's go. Come on, man.

122
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:41,649
This guy's name is like a swear

123
00:06:41,649 --> 00:06:43,819
I think. Alright, well whatever.

124
00:06:43,819 --> 00:06:48,220
Let's go. Enter the mist.

125
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:54,050
Alright, let's go.

126
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:56,050
He's coming for me. He's coming for me. He's doing his

127
00:06:56,050 --> 00:07:00,139
thing. He missed.

128
00:07:00,139 --> 00:07:03,660
What the hell? You throwing like spears

129
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:05,899
at him? This guy like killed him instantly.

130
00:07:05,899 --> 00:07:09,680
Dude, this guy

131
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:14,860
he shot me

132
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:17,230
with those. He probably

133
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:19,230
thinks I'm such an idiot.

134
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:23,069
He

135
00:07:23,069 --> 00:07:25,069
just like unloaded on

136
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:27,069
me.
