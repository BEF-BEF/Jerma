1
00:00:03,259 --> 00:00:07,580
Uh, so I have no idea how this game works. We're gonna give it a try. See if it's any good.

2
00:00:10,179 --> 00:00:14,980
Hard Space Ship Breaker. Okay, I did already make an account in this game because I knew we were

3
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:20,980
probably gonna pivot because... I don't know. I had it just in case. We needed to do it, right?

4
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:43,130
Turn this shit on so you can hear it. And we add it. Looking for a... There you are.

5
00:00:43,689 --> 00:00:53,700
This is Hard Space Ship Breaker. This for cleanup detail in space is what I've been told. We're ready

6
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:57,619
for Evolvo. Okay, anybody that says anything that says Evolvo in it and please play it,

7
00:00:57,619 --> 00:01:05,989
I want you to ban them for at least four hours. At least. That's like 240,000 minutes.

8
00:01:06,549 --> 00:01:30,939
Don't want that one. All right, let's go. This is me, Jerry. Career. Please, please. How do you...

9
00:01:30,939 --> 00:01:45,849
How does this game work? I guess it's gonna tell me, right? Wait, was I supposed to jump?

10
00:01:51,620 --> 00:02:20,870
I can't even hear his audio. Okay, shh. Let's get to work. All right, how do I do this? Open

11
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:36,090
the work order. Thrust forward. Thrust backward. Descend. Ascend. Break. Roll. Oh, boy. Thrust

12
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:47,379
backwards. Now, uh, descend for three seconds. I want to change that though. I don't like to see

13
00:02:47,379 --> 00:03:02,069
his descend. Descend for three seconds. Controls break. I'm so glad there's a break that's a hard

14
00:03:02,069 --> 00:03:23,620
break. Grapple. It rolls. Yeah, roll left for two seconds. Depute game. That's all right. I've been

15
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:42,090
known to at least get an hour into puke games. Grapple. Grapple. Hold. Push an object when

16
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:52,580
grappled is F. Some objects can be detached with your grapple. Look for the detach prompt. Whoa,

17
00:03:52,580 --> 00:04:07,289
wait a minute. That's a push? So F pushes. I want it to descend. Can you not move when you're in

18
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:16,100
the... Okay, maybe you can't move. All right, salvage the antenna. How do you salvage something?

19
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:32,100
Grapple. And then I drag it over here. Green arrows. Yeah, but how do I pull it over there?

20
00:04:32,579 --> 00:04:44,709
Use the grapple to attach an antenna. Push when... Push. No, that's not an antenna.

21
00:04:45,269 --> 00:04:56,819
Oh, where the... Where the fuck is an antenna? Wait, that's the antenna. This doesn't look like

22
00:04:56,819 --> 00:05:06,490
an antenna. I thought it wanted me to grapple with weird things. I don't know. It didn't... Okay.

23
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:17,139
Grapple the antenna. Hit the brakes. Breaks. Breaks. Break. Oh, this is not going to work well.

24
00:05:17,139 --> 00:05:20,300
This is going to be bad. This is going to be bad. This is going to be very bad. I'm not going to be

25
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:36,220
able to do this. Attach an antenna. This is going to be really tricky. Okay, grab and detach.

26
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:58,339
Shoot the antenna. Didn't I just do that? All right, then throw it in there.

27
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:52,870
Physics gun. The whole game is physics. No. Scanner. Cut points. Oh, cut points. I see some.

28
00:06:52,870 --> 00:07:12,220
Are they yellow? Okay, so you need to cut this shit. Cut level two. Execute the cut. Grapple.

29
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:41,699
Equip the cutter. Z. It's two. Could it be Z? Okay, let me see it. I'm trying to do the cut.

30
00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:53,980
Okay, I just pressed two. I pressed it like five times. Descend! It's C. Oh my god, it's not

31
00:07:53,980 --> 00:08:07,139
control. You were grappling. Amazon keyboard. No, no, I wouldn't... I don't even know what direction

32
00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:14,839
we've been looking at this fucking thing. All right, scan it. Right there. All right, stop moving.

33
00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:42,220
Cut that. Cutting it. Can I do it? Cut point. Right there, right? Does it have to go through it?

34
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:55,909
Isn't the cut point right here? Salvage it. Yeah, but do I have to pull it off? I don't understand.

35
00:08:55,909 --> 00:09:02,820
Do I have to be like looking? I thought it was x-ray vision, guys. I thought it was x-ray vision.

36
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:20,309
I thought that was inside of this thing. Is it because I'm too far away? What the fuck is going

37
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:49,340
on? Am I not cutting it? Okay, so you have to be right next to it. Okay, what? There's another one

38
00:09:49,340 --> 00:10:07,450
right here. There it goes. All right, cool. I get it. Can I spin this thing around? Wrong timing,

39
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:13,799
though. The floating around. You guys watch me play Outer Wilds. This is like extra controls.

40
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:30,679
I want space to be down. Space should be down. And I want... What the hell do I want? Like one

41
00:10:30,679 --> 00:10:48,580
of the mouse buttons. Okay, so that's that side done. Cut this thing right here. I don't think

42
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:52,580
you have to actually cut it. I think you just have to let it heat it up till it disappears.

43
00:10:52,580 --> 00:11:12,120
I'm going to salvage this thing somehow. So can I... Do I have to go around it?

44
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:29,029
This thing actually cut through walls. Okay, so I'm done cutting. Am I? So it cuts through walls.

45
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:48,740
Is there face damage? Is it like into the screen damage? I'm just gonna hold the break the whole

46
00:11:48,740 --> 00:12:20,200
time. I had it right. Go closer. Go closer. What the fuck? What? I don't... What am I doing wrong?

47
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:45,450
The arrows. What? I'm not supposed to cut all this shit? Or... We just pick it up? All right,

48
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:59,940
where's that salvage thing? All right, there it is. All right, throwing. Is that gonna get in there

49
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:34,700
or is that not gonna make it? It's not gonna make it. Space. Yeah, isn't it? It's supposed to be.

50
00:13:47,269 --> 00:13:54,120
Not flat earth. You don't have to grapple to push. Oh, all right. Okay, I get it. Cool.

51
00:13:54,120 --> 00:14:08,730
Don't have to cut all the yellow. Just the ones that they point at. Cool. Certification. 16 out of

52
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:16,120
16. I got it. I'm good. I have a hot trillion dollars. Why am I working here? Oh, that's my

53
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:50,120
debt. That's how much I owe. Oh, okay. Probably bull shit. Go home. Trillion dollar debt. Yeah,

54
00:14:50,120 --> 00:15:20,379
that's weird. That seems like a lot. All right, I got it. I went home. Get in the habitat. He did

55
00:15:20,379 --> 00:15:30,009
it. Whoa, yay. Rank two. You've achieved the prestigious rank of basic certification. You

56
00:15:30,009 --> 00:15:45,429
unlocked modular laser cutter upgrades and ship class. Yeah, complete the shift. Minimum payments

57
00:15:45,429 --> 00:16:12,120
are due? Whoa. What's this? Laser cutter. Okay. So, this is split saw license? Cutting head fires

58
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:25,080
a splitting beam for speedier and more capable ship disassembly. Yeah, that sounds cool. Start

59
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:47,769
shift. That's too many things. I don't understand all these things. Thank you. Can you tell if

60
00:16:47,769 --> 00:16:56,519
everybody can chat that, please? I can't run until I know how to walk. Establish maximum amount of

61
00:16:56,519 --> 00:17:24,819
value. Split saw. I can swap the head. Okay. Rotate the cut angle. All right, let's go.

62
00:17:29,269 --> 00:17:36,569
Work order? All right, salvage the soft crate, the aluminum, and the nano carbon. All right,

63
00:17:36,569 --> 00:17:44,359
where's the aluminum? All right. Processor. We're going to the processor. This one here.

64
00:17:44,359 --> 00:18:01,529
What do we got? There's nothing in there. Where's the aluminum? Oh, that's where I was about to go

65
00:18:01,529 --> 00:18:10,759
into it. I was about to trash myself into the furnace. I thought these were like Mario paintings.

66
00:18:12,579 --> 00:18:18,740
I was going to go in them and say, oh, here, this is this area. All right. Is this thing right here?

67
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:31,059
Oh, this panel's aluminum. Oh, sick. Why can't I pull it off? All right, this is cutting angle.

68
00:18:31,619 --> 00:18:39,240
Got to go right here. Ready? That was pretty cool. Did it do anything? Oh, fuck. I just didn't

69
00:18:39,240 --> 00:19:13,420
mean to do that. Wait, I took it off. Am I supposed to do that? Wait, like this, right? Wow. I got it.

70
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:26,660
It's aluminum. Okay, I like this game. This game's cool. Let's go. I need one that can carry heavy

71
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:41,130
objects into the processor, right? The processor wants aluminum? Processor aluminum. Doesn't want

72
00:19:41,130 --> 00:20:03,900
aluminum. No. Oh, there's a processor in here. Hold on. This computer's in here. Is this somebody's

73
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:13,670
computer? Is there a flashlight? Wait, where's the processor? I just saw it. Is that it? Is that a

74
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:36,980
processor? Is there a flashlight? There's not. All right, that's a... I can't just pick it up.

75
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:42,230
Oh, shit. Okay, this processor. Be careful with this thing. All right, get it in there.

76
00:20:42,789 --> 00:21:06,279
It's like Paperboy. It's not a processor. This is a barge. Furnace. Processor. Is the processor in

77
00:21:06,279 --> 00:21:17,750
here? Wow, this computer sucks. I can't take... I can't pick it up. I have to cut it out with this,

78
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:40,599
don't I? Oh! Pretending. What are you talking about? That processor's right there. I'm trying to pull

79
00:21:40,599 --> 00:22:05,460
it out. I can't pull it out. For the processor. Furnace. Barge. Well, we don't... Oh. I don't have

80
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:08,420
a barge. So what the fuck am I supposed to do with this? That's why it's freaking me out.

81
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:30,299
All right, cut this shit up. It's not a computer. This is still connected. Hold on. What else is

82
00:22:30,299 --> 00:22:35,500
there? It's still connected. Fuck you. All right, everything's... Nope. Down here. Disconnect this,

83
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:55,220
too. All right, everything's been disconnected. Cut this. They didn't say it had to be pretty.

84
00:22:55,779 --> 00:23:15,990
Come on, get up. This is supposed to go to the barge, but I don't have a barge.

85
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:53,529
All right, don't mess it up. Hit the brakes. Wow! It'll get in. It's that thing below you.

86
00:23:55,210 --> 00:24:05,000
Oh, okay. Where's that thing that I threw? What's that for? Barge? All right, I got a barge. It's

87
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:18,940
down here. Don't please get in the corner. Okay, good. Shit, I didn't do it though. I threw... All

88
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:38,579
right, I get it now. I understand it now. Processor. Furnace, I mean. Okay. Aluminum has been salvaged.

89
00:24:38,579 --> 00:24:48,920
That wasn't... Wait, what's going on? Why does this say processor now? What? This is a different

90
00:24:48,920 --> 00:25:02,630
material? The other one... The front panel was furnace. Handle. Nanocarbon. Processor. Okay.

91
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:30,259
Maybe play a game that you can handle. Ban that guy for now. Do I have to cut anything on this?

92
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:46,009
All this is going to the processor, so just punch it. I could cut it into smaller pieces. I could,

93
00:25:46,009 --> 00:25:56,710
but I could just dump it in here, couldn't I? This whole thing. Processor. Yeah, the whole thing.

94
00:25:56,710 --> 00:26:08,500
Processor. Processor. Processor. Get it in there. Why cut them into small pieces? Do you take the

95
00:26:08,579 --> 00:26:19,180
whole thing? Okay, this is all processor. Processor. Processor. All right, get it in there.

96
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:45,849
Eventually, it's probably gonna be too heavy to do that, but it's fine. So this whole... This needs

97
00:26:45,849 --> 00:26:56,299
to go into the furnace. That's the barge. Let's get it. All right, now I just need to do the

98
00:26:56,299 --> 00:27:09,980
aluminum. I gotta cut this though, don't I? I can't take the whole thing. Can I cut this in half?

99
00:27:10,779 --> 00:27:25,769
Does that not work? Holy shit, that's awesome. Wait, this is actually how I cut up an apple.

100
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:29,589
That's so cool. I just needed to see it for myself. Okay, processor. Get it in there.

101
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:55,529
Furnace. Furnace. This is awesome. This is awesome. I love this. Okay, processor.

102
00:27:55,529 --> 00:28:10,599
You got it. Okay. Furnace. What is this? Let's go down. I gotta cut this up a little more.

103
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:31,829
Okay, this is the furnace. We got like one crumb. I'm not doing that right. No, no, no, no, no. Give

104
00:28:31,829 --> 00:28:50,700
me, give me, give me. I don't know why I get what you're saying, but I get what you're saying.

105
00:28:51,259 --> 00:28:55,880
I get it. I don't know how it makes sense, but it does. Somebody said this is like trying to stuff

106
00:28:55,880 --> 00:29:02,730
an entire steak in your mouth. Yeah, it kind of is. It's that same energy. It's got that same vibe to

107
00:29:02,730 --> 00:29:22,819
it. Okay, get this thing up. I gotta cut. Can I not cut through this shit? All right, into the

108
00:29:22,819 --> 00:29:31,130
furnace. This is taking me so long to do this. This is gonna get like studied. There's gonna be

109
00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:47,130
a room full of guys in suits studying this with lab coats on. I have to detach it from here.

110
00:29:47,130 --> 00:29:57,430
Feels so good to do that though. I don't even care if it looks like shit. It feels good.

111
00:29:58,309 --> 00:30:11,210
Okay, don't let it fly away. Furnace. It'll get there. How many more do I need? 200 kilograms?

112
00:30:16,809 --> 00:30:25,259
Please. He's cutting the crust off his sandwiches.

113
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:34,960
Cut.

114
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:47,369
Go to a processor. What the fuck are you talking about? No, no, no. Only one of those goes into the

115
00:30:47,369 --> 00:30:59,640
processor. Stay right here. Which one of those goes in the processor? The thing on top? I need

116
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:07,130
to swim over here. All right, stop, stop, stop, stop. I have to cut this out. This is furnace.

117
00:31:07,130 --> 00:31:31,720
This is processor. I can't remove this. Oh, oh, wow. This is fun. Sick. This game's awesome.

118
00:31:32,359 --> 00:31:49,430
I love this game. Okay, I need one more for the furnace. That's a tuber voice. No, it's not. I

119
00:31:49,430 --> 00:32:16,630
did it. I got extra money. I did it. Keep going. That's such a mess. I'd rather start new now that

120
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:25,910
I get it. I truly get it now. So that's things over there. It's just an absolute train wreck.

121
00:32:26,549 --> 00:32:41,640
Oh, I unlocked grapple upgrade. Destroyed. I didn't lose any money though, right? All right,

122
00:32:41,640 --> 00:33:00,539
that's fine. New equipment. Grapple. Peather. Peathers can be deployed to establish two

123
00:33:00,539 --> 00:33:04,619
electromagnetic anchors that pull objects along a field medium. All right, that's huge.

124
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:22,309
That's actually huge. Use ship catalog? What is this thing? What is that? Current ship.

125
00:33:23,029 --> 00:33:28,569
Claiming a new ship will clear the salvage bay of your existing ship.

126
00:33:31,029 --> 00:33:52,859
What? Who cares? Yes, this is technically another cleaning game. Man. Wow. Okay,

127
00:33:52,859 --> 00:33:58,490
I gotta be careful. Cutter temporarily disabled to prevent unnecessary destruction to company

128
00:33:58,490 --> 00:34:33,030
equipped by inexperienced cutters. It's tether? All right, cancel tethers. Tether multiple objects

129
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:46,199
together or stack multiple on a single object for even greater strength. Sick. All right,

130
00:34:46,199 --> 00:35:00,949
I got it. I did tethers. What's pulling them in? Should it be doing that? Okay, now what?

131
00:35:00,949 --> 00:35:19,210
Cutter is disabled. Why is the cutter disabled? What is this? Can I pull this stuff off?

132
00:35:20,170 --> 00:35:38,219
Tether to the barge. New work order. Salvage the nassil. Okay, where's my cutter? Why is it

133
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:49,829
my cutter's disabled? How do I delete the cutter? I need to put this in the barge.

134
00:35:50,710 --> 00:36:06,489
Throw the thrusters into the barge. No, why did I want me to tether these? You're gonna pull it?

135
00:36:06,489 --> 00:36:26,090
Okay, cancel tether. What? That's like 600 light years away. I did not know the range was that

136
00:36:26,090 --> 00:36:33,590
extreme. Okay, my cutter only goes like four feet. My tethers go across the entire Atlantic Ocean.

137
00:36:34,230 --> 00:37:13,300
Use more tethers? Oh, shit. Okay, compression points? Okay, I see a lot of green. What's the

138
00:37:13,300 --> 00:38:01,880
green mean? Okay, airlock. Enter through the airlock. I have to go in? What the fuck? What the hell?

139
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:34,230
Wait, I'm in another game. This is freaking me out. Pressurize. That's it? For the atmosphere

140
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:52,099
regulator? It has a nuke sign on it. Engine. Cabin. Cabin. Airlock. Cabin. Cabin. Cabin. Cabin.

141
00:38:53,130 --> 00:39:18,070
Cabin. Engine. Engine. Cabin. What are the arrows? Where are the arrows? What do you mean? Oh, fuck.

142
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:43,239
Use it. Cut the reactor. Look at the reactor. It gets out. Okay.

143
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:53,380
I can do that right through here. I'm just gonna cut this whole thing down.

144
00:39:53,380 --> 00:40:23,460
Okay, so just open up the side and take it right off the fucking exit you make for yourself. Done.

145
00:40:24,019 --> 00:40:41,980
Okay, cool. Done. It's gonna come out here. Wait, there's another one. Where am I? I can't cut

146
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:48,920
through this. Why? What are these? Like batteries in here? It's the hull of this ship. Wait, I have

147
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:59,349
to... I need like a good spot to go. I'll just go... Oh, just go through the door.

148
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:44,099
Just take it through here. Who cares? Don't put it over there. Put it over here.

149
00:41:44,099 --> 00:42:06,340
I got it. Into the barge. All right, salvage the nanocarbon. Easy. Can I not open... I can't

150
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:22,489
cut through the hull. I can cut through this. It's just the controls. I just broke the controller.

151
00:42:24,679 --> 00:42:27,960
No, no, no. Get it in the furnace. Get it in the furnace at least. Where did it go?

152
00:42:31,219 --> 00:42:46,010
Whatever. Cut the yellow? I can't cut any of this. I can't cut it. Let's go back in here.

153
00:42:46,010 --> 00:42:53,210
Can't cut through nanocarbon. Oh, that's stupid. All right, what do we got in here?

154
00:42:54,219 --> 00:43:12,739
Oh, look at this. Was this aluminum? Oh, I love aluminum. Let's cut this first. Oh, fuck. Oh,

155
00:43:12,739 --> 00:43:17,539
fuck. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck.

156
00:43:17,539 --> 00:43:36,760
Oh, okay. That goes in the furnace. Does it all go in the furnace? I hope so. Oh, this goes in the

157
00:43:36,760 --> 00:44:06,889
processor. Hold on. I can take care of this. How'd it happen? No, shit. No, no, no, no, no. Get back

158
00:44:06,889 --> 00:44:13,019
here. Get back here. Get back here. Okay. Back, back, back, back. I need that processor part.

159
00:44:14,650 --> 00:44:18,010
I'm going into the fire. I'm going into the fire. All right. I'm going. I'm going to the fire. I

160
00:44:18,010 --> 00:44:31,400
can't. It's pulling me in. There's a current. Just whatever. So, how do I get the nanocarbon to be?

161
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:36,980
I need to... Oh, I have to get it off. Okay. I have to remove it. I get it. I get it. I get it. I get

162
00:44:36,980 --> 00:44:47,079
it. I get it. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Go, go, go, go. All right. Check this

163
00:44:47,079 --> 00:45:01,139
out. Not that. This. I'm going to get up there. I've got to be ready. I've got to cut this piece

164
00:45:01,139 --> 00:45:21,639
off of the nanocarbon. Dude. Chuck E. Cheese is here. How do I get this piece out? This goes in

165
00:45:21,639 --> 00:45:33,800
the processor. They both go in the processor? Okay. Process it, right? Can I just drag it? Okay.

166
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:53,690
Tether into here. Can it work? I hope so. Nice. Chuck E. Cheese. Good luck to Chuck.

167
00:45:55,849 --> 00:46:03,539
How do I pull this off? Oh, shit. Hold on. I'm just going to take the whole thing apart. Who cares?

168
00:46:03,539 --> 00:46:18,869
Whatever. Let's just go. Just rip it apart. It doesn't matter. Isn't that a Dane Cook movie?

169
00:46:18,869 --> 00:46:41,989
I have no idea. Nesquik is here. Dude, they're all here. Hold on. This one's floating up. Tether it.

170
00:46:42,789 --> 00:46:53,690
I don't know. How much more do I need? This is really cool though. I really like this.

171
00:46:54,489 --> 00:47:09,510
All right. Hold up. Do I salvage everything? Do I salvage everything?

172
00:47:10,230 --> 00:47:41,239
I'm getting too excited. Okay. Hold on. Stop. Really? What? People happy. Corporate. People

173
00:47:41,239 --> 00:47:52,650
happy. Corporate. Can I get through here? This is on there pretty tight. No, I can't. Wait.

174
00:47:52,650 --> 00:48:12,309
Holy shit. What is all this stuff? Cut this off. Taking the whole hull off. Tried to tell you.

175
00:48:13,559 --> 00:48:28,760
It did. But I didn't listen. Okay. One more. This whole thing's going to fall off.

176
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:37,980
This all goes to the processor. Wait. This goes to the barge. Get this shit off. Leave this stuff

177
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:49,500
over here. Can I pull shit towards me? What is this? Why is this in here? Get out of here.

178
00:48:55,639 --> 00:49:17,829
Bank of America. Dude. Bank of America in chat. It's gone. Whatever. Fuck it. This is attached

179
00:49:17,829 --> 00:49:36,070
by so many things. I hope I can really push this. Chuck E. Cheese just raided the channel.

180
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:54,789
Actual Chuck E. Cheese raid. Entertainment is my middle name. No, it's not. It's Edward and we all

181
00:49:54,789 --> 00:50:10,519
know it. Thanks for the raid. Welcome everybody from Chuck E. Cheese. We're playing. This is a

182
00:50:10,519 --> 00:50:19,190
salvage game. We salvage materials from a spacecraft and you have to make money and you

183
00:50:19,190 --> 00:50:28,889
get to carve stuff and slice through the hull. This is it, right? Is it going to happen?

184
00:50:29,449 --> 00:50:37,400
All right. I kind of, how do I get it up? Can you salvage this stream?

185
00:50:42,059 --> 00:50:50,280
Quiet, quiet, quiet down. Quiet. Quiet. I'm not going to hear that. I'm not going to hear that

186
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:59,510
right now. This whole thing's going to come apart. Are you really going to say that to me in front of

187
00:50:59,510 --> 00:51:25,300
Charles Entertainment Cheese? How could you? It's still holding this on. It wants to game. New

188
00:51:25,300 --> 00:51:43,239
streamer friend. It's Chuck E. Cheese. All right. How do I, can I move this? What the fuck is this

189
00:51:43,239 --> 00:51:51,940
year? I, that's a great question. What do you want to play? Does he talk? Does Chuck E. Cheese talk

190
00:51:51,940 --> 00:52:07,110
in this universe? You're swearing. Oh, that's, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, plays guitar. No, no. I mean,

191
00:52:07,110 --> 00:52:17,000
but like it, does he talk on his stream or is it a silent stream? It's important to know. No,

192
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:21,239
I don't want to play fall guys. All right. Well, Chuck E. Cheese, well, Chuck E. Cheese play

193
00:52:22,039 --> 00:52:27,659
like a horror game, a horrible one where like zombies are like attacking us and Chuck E. Cheese

194
00:52:27,659 --> 00:52:42,389
is like bury an ax in a zombie's head. I haven't gotten my mic set up. What? I'm just asking a

195
00:52:42,389 --> 00:52:55,139
question. That's all goes processor, right? He said, no, he's a family friendly mascot.

196
00:52:56,869 --> 00:53:01,110
No, we're just buddies though, right now. You know what I mean? Like, okay, guys, I'm sorry to tell

197
00:53:01,110 --> 00:53:16,550
you when Chuck E. Cheese takes the mask off, he, he might say the, he might say shit sometimes,

198
00:53:16,550 --> 00:53:40,619
mask. I'm just saying like a theoretical, like a, like a metaphorical mask. Don't say that. I

199
00:53:40,619 --> 00:53:48,420
imagine like, I imagine a lot of like, like the Chuck E. Cheese, like eye ups right now going,

200
00:53:48,420 --> 00:53:52,340
all right, hold on a second. Who, who, who is this guy that we just rated? Okay. What does he,

201
00:53:52,340 --> 00:53:54,739
what does he do? What does he do? Does he, any family? Does he, does he, does he, does he,

202
00:53:54,739 --> 00:54:02,679
can he talk about cartoons? Can he talk? What's he saying? Oh shit. What have we done? Why is he

203
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:06,599
why does he talk about, why does he talk about his ass? He's talking about eating ass. We have to

204
00:54:06,599 --> 00:54:26,489
get out of here. Charles, go find a Fortnite streamer quick. No, seriously, thanks. I used to

205
00:54:26,489 --> 00:54:35,820
love Chuck E. Cheese when I was a kid. My favorite place ever. You know, I can't, I can't think of a

206
00:54:35,820 --> 00:54:42,199
bad memory I had of Chuck E. Cheese. I really can't. I'd love to tell you that that's fake.

207
00:54:43,269 --> 00:55:02,170
Always have just good memories from Chuck E. Cheese. Please don't miss. Chuck E. Cheese puke

208
00:55:02,170 --> 00:55:05,769
story. There's no Chuck E. Cheese puke story. Why would I puke there? They have some of the

209
00:55:05,769 --> 00:55:12,949
finest cheeses. They have some of the most delicious red sauce on their pizza. What are

210
00:55:12,949 --> 00:55:32,280
you on about? True. All right. I have to, I, did I do it? What's the hab? Did I get some more? I feel

211
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:39,190
like I want more. Not, I don't want, I want one more. Which way is the right way of the ship?

212
00:55:41,079 --> 00:55:52,010
Yeah, I want a little bit more. What are these attached to? A bunch of nothing. Still in chat.

213
00:55:52,570 --> 00:56:03,610
Yeah, that's good. Oh, all right. Over here. You think I'm really going to turn down a new

214
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:19,960
streamer best friend? That's Chuck E. Cheese. That hurt. I'm sorry. I mean, sorry, kids.

215
00:56:20,519 --> 00:56:49,130
I'm sorry, kids. More in there. I can't help it. What if Chuck E. Cheese became my best friend?

216
00:56:50,010 --> 00:57:01,030
Then I would definitely be in a cartoon universe. What is it still attached to?

217
00:57:01,829 --> 00:57:24,699
I want to just take the whole hole. Yeah. Okay. Now what? A few more over here. I feel like that's

218
00:57:24,699 --> 00:57:28,780
a conversation I would have with my mother over the phone and she would start to get worried

219
00:57:29,659 --> 00:57:35,059
and ask me like if everything was like, okay. Hey mom, you wouldn't believe it. My new best

220
00:57:35,059 --> 00:57:39,619
friend is Chuck E. Cheese. You know, the rat from Chuck E. Cheese. He's coming over tomorrow.

221
00:57:42,340 --> 00:57:52,519
Okay. Jeremy, how do you feel? How are you feeling right now? That's a like, how are you doing

222
00:57:52,519 --> 00:58:07,670
conversation that my mother would have? CBD is taking over. There we go. Look at this. I guess.

223
00:58:07,670 --> 00:58:13,030
Look at all this money. All this money. I'm going to get that tethered together. Let's do a double

224
00:58:13,030 --> 00:58:18,250
tether right now. Everyone's going to be like, Holy shit. I didn't even think of that. There you go.

225
00:58:18,250 --> 00:58:39,050
Check it out. Look at that. Tether that too. Tether this too. Take the whole thing. Nice. It'll get

226
00:58:39,050 --> 00:58:48,420
there. Don't worry. Being friends with Chuck E. Cheese is like a throwaway family guy bit. Yeah,

227
00:58:48,420 --> 00:59:06,170
but this is real. Oh, no furnace, right? Yeah. Can I take this whole thing now? Yes. Make a giant

228
00:59:06,170 --> 00:59:35,110
train. Need a little bit more tension over here. How's it breaking? Hold it. Shit. Did I lose it?

229
00:59:35,110 --> 00:59:45,460
There goes the broom. Whatever. I'm being hosted by Chuck E. Cheese. It just feels so weird to me.

230
00:59:46,179 --> 00:59:56,710
Does this feel so surreal? This is like some type of weird comedy validation that I'm getting right

231
00:59:56,710 --> 01:00:16,389
now. Dude, I'm being hosted by Chuck E. Cheese. Man. Nice. It's real. I know. I keep, I see the

232
01:00:16,389 --> 01:00:29,179
raid. It's ridiculous. Just give me the damn thing. Whatever. All right. I need some tethers,

233
01:00:29,179 --> 01:00:32,460
tethers, tethers, tethers, tethers, tethers, tethers, tethers, tethers, tethers, tethers, tethers.

234
01:00:32,460 --> 01:00:45,079
I don't know what I'm doing. Freeze, freeze, freeze, freeze the game. Pause. Fuck. It's time

235
01:00:45,079 --> 01:00:58,469
to wake up, Jeremy. I need to carve this off and not be an idiot. First of all, second of all,

236
01:01:00,019 --> 01:01:26,329
carve this. Easy. What the? What is it being held on by? Nothing left. There's nothing,

237
01:01:26,329 --> 01:01:50,699
it's not attached to anything. It's not attached to anything. Oh, gonna work. Carve this shit

238
01:01:50,699 --> 01:01:54,860
while it's being pulled. Wow. That probably would have killed me if I didn't get out of the way.

239
01:01:55,659 --> 01:02:07,900
It doesn't mean I get to be in like a Chuck E. Cheese commercial. You know what I mean?

240
01:02:11,449 --> 01:02:15,130
All right. Can I just, I don't want to do anything. Look, I'll do this for free. I don't even care.

241
01:02:16,280 --> 01:02:23,079
Can I be the guy that they paint, like there's a lot of quick cuts and it cuts to, like it cuts to

242
01:02:23,079 --> 01:02:27,719
a guy like me and I've got a bunch of tickets in my hands. There's two pizzas in front of me.

243
01:02:28,599 --> 01:02:32,280
And there's like three or four other like family members and I've got a bunch of tickets

244
01:02:32,360 --> 01:02:37,980
and I'm like, like that with like two fistfuls of tickets and there's three

245
01:02:37,980 --> 01:02:46,119
untouched pizzas in front of me. That's a one, like a two second cut. Can I be, can I go like this?

246
01:02:46,119 --> 01:02:52,469
Like, can I be like, like looking around for new games? Like it just make, put me somewhere.

247
01:02:52,469 --> 01:02:56,150
Look, I'll even just give it to you right now. Like you can just use this. Like ready? Like,

248
01:02:56,150 --> 01:03:02,539
oh, there's new games at Chuck E. Cheese. I'll be like, like I don't use it. I don't care.

249
01:03:03,750 --> 01:03:06,949
You can literally put it where I do it. You can use it wherever you want.

250
01:03:06,949 --> 01:03:14,710
Just do it on a green screen. No, it has to be like there, like in my, on my camera.

251
01:03:14,710 --> 01:03:31,210
Nice and hairy armpits. Somebody, I didn't, I manscaped really recently. So wrong. Use RTX.

252
01:03:34,980 --> 01:03:43,300
Not the brand. No, the, like the, the term, just because somebody made a product that is called

253
01:03:43,300 --> 01:03:52,300
manscape, that's the term that existed. Prove it. Show a receipt. A receipt for what?

254
01:03:52,619 --> 01:04:08,440
What have I done? I'm talking about my, my, by the way, no dust. I'm talking about like,

255
01:04:09,860 --> 01:04:14,260
I don't, okay. Should I just go to just chatting and just who fucking cares anymore?

256
01:04:16,659 --> 01:04:22,340
I feel like Chuck E. Cheese has turned this stream like it's not, it's not who cares about

257
01:04:22,340 --> 01:04:26,500
this video game. Chuck E. Cheese is my best friend now. Like who cares about the game I'm playing.

258
01:04:26,500 --> 01:04:46,219
Fuck it. Okay. All right. Hold on. I'll be back. Let me just put on, let me just put on underwear.
