1
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:12,490
Good morning or good, uh, good afternoon. Is it morning for anybody right now? What time is it

2
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:23,660
right now for anybody? It's 1 30 pacific. So what time is it? Let me look at it. Let me look at the

3
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:33,460
big country map. Let's see. Map of the world. I'm curious about this. All right, so what time is it

4
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:51,530
in Russia right now? Or Japan, right? What time is it in Japan or China? It's 10 30 am in Hawaii.

5
00:00:51,530 --> 00:01:06,310
There you go. Good morning. Those of you that live in Hawaii, welcome to the stream. Today,

6
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:12,569
we are going to do something a little different. I did declare last night this was going to be a

7
00:01:12,569 --> 00:01:21,879
fuckface stream, and it is. We're going to start with the super higher AI learning predictive

8
00:01:21,879 --> 00:01:28,840
text machine called Talk to Transformer. Highly requested last night. Pretty good way to open up

9
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:34,579
the fuckface stream. Um, and then we're probably gonna move on to Jackbox. Haven't done that in

10
00:01:34,579 --> 00:01:40,060
a while, so probably do that for like, I don't know, two or three hours. Do this for like

11
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:44,980
an hour, I don't know, 30 minutes. How long can you, how can you realistically do this

12
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:48,500
for more than an hour? I guess you could just sit here and write sentences, right?

13
00:01:55,400 --> 00:02:00,280
But, uh, reason why I'm starting so early and the reason why we're stopping so early

14
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:07,609
is because I have to go pick somebody up at the airport and then hang out with somebody.

15
00:02:07,609 --> 00:02:17,669
That's why the last couple of streams have been in the earlier afternoon Pacific. No, it's not

16
00:02:17,669 --> 00:02:21,909
star, okay? I'm just gonna make that really clear. You know, I wish it was sometimes.

17
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:30,979
I think I'm gonna see him real soon though. Sometimes, you know, I just wish my fucking

18
00:02:30,979 --> 00:02:37,460
friend would come and visit me, but I haven't visited him either, so you know, I haven't

19
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:50,229
gone like to see him. No, everybody has to come see me, but yeah, I think actually I'll

20
00:02:50,229 --> 00:02:59,659
see him in the summer. Yeah, trapped in my house. Germany is the center of the universe.

21
00:02:59,659 --> 00:03:06,310
That's a pretty good way to start what we are about to start. I think that's a good one to

22
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:21,530
start on. So, uh, this little machine here, what this does is when you type in a sentence

23
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:28,840
or a paragraph or a phrase, this will make up an entire predictive story, predictive text. It

24
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:37,349
just, it just essentially is a story generator or phrase generator, like when you're typing on

25
00:03:37,349 --> 00:03:47,699
your phone. I don't know where it even pulls information from. It just works. Yeah, this is

26
00:03:47,699 --> 00:03:54,090
blindingly bright. Can you adjust the colors? Uh, hold on. Let me see. Is it, is it bright?

27
00:03:54,090 --> 00:04:02,069
How bright is it? Maybe I can. Let me see if I can adjust the brightness.

28
00:04:02,069 --> 00:04:12,020
Oh, check this shit out. Yeah, I can. No, I can't. Oh, yeah. Look at, look what I can do.

29
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:21,610
Look at what I'm capable of. I might be a little too much. Hold on.

30
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:34,120
Hue shift. We can make it green. Whoa, hold on. I can make it like purple. Now that's blue is

31
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:40,310
fine. That's fine. Turn it up a little bit more. Is that good? Is that easier on your eyes?

32
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:49,430
Can you see it better? The contrast up a little bit more. That should be fine. All right,

33
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:52,629
so we're, we're going to press complete text. We're going to just test it out and see

34
00:04:52,629 --> 00:05:00,860
what it does. Germany is the center of the universe and I kind of want to make it so I

35
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:07,980
have to scroll down. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

36
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:16,470
Uh, this is, this is really fucking long. Let me make it so you can't see this shit until

37
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:32,870
I'm ready to show it. I need to do this. Hold on. You know what I mean? I don't want

38
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:39,660
you guys, I don't want it to be a spoiler. I want to just, I want to be able to read it.

39
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:45,269
There we go. Okay. All right. So this is the first thing we generated. I'm going to,

40
00:05:45,269 --> 00:05:50,540
I'm going to dramatically read every single one of these. So you know what that means.

41
00:05:50,540 --> 00:06:13,180
You're going to get fucking voices today. So why don't we start. Germany is the center

42
00:06:13,259 --> 00:06:18,730
of the universe. The only other planet in our solar system is Neptune because there

43
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:25,879
is no ice in its orbit. While the atmosphere of Mars is much thinner, the atmosphere of Jupiter

44
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,040
has a larger density than the atmosphere of Mars, which makes it much less dense

45
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:37,050
than the atmosphere of earth. This can account for the fact that Jupiter has so many moons

46
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:43,370
and are so crowded with comets that moons orbit Jupiter more than planets do.

47
00:06:44,009 --> 00:06:50,759
This is similar to our own moon. In addition, while planets like Jupiter and Saturn have

48
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:58,230
surface areas about the size as our own planet, planets like earth have many times the area of

49
00:06:58,230 --> 00:07:08,300
our moon compared to other worlds. And so the density of our atmosphere is closer to the earth.

50
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:14,379
So while planets can have water oceans, the majority of the water on earth lies within the

51
00:07:14,379 --> 00:07:23,000
atmosphere because Venus has no atmosphere. It is completely vapor-filled and is the only

52
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,250
planet in our solar system that can be seen with the naked eye. Venus has an atmosphere

53
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:34,819
that can withstand a tremendous amount of ultraviolet radiation since water vapor and the

54
00:07:34,819 --> 00:07:45,829
light it emits is the. This is just a gigantic logic problem. I feel like I'm

55
00:07:45,829 --> 00:07:57,750
going to have to solve for X here at some point. Okay. The only other planet in our

56
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:06,649
solar system is Neptune. How does that make? Wait, what are they talking about?

57
00:08:06,649 --> 00:08:10,250
They just went off on like a huge tangent of how Mars and earth and

58
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:22,779
stop this music for now. Build background contextual music.

59
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:29,500
Hello. Say less science. Well, I didn't know that was going to happen.

60
00:08:42,379 --> 00:09:09,500
There, you happy? I eat boogers. Ha ha. I probably shouldn't tell you this though.

61
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:15,620
Just go and have a look anyway. It was fun while it lasted. Lying back against the wall,

62
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:21,940
Coy gave the bender a look that told her the boy didn't care that she was lying right next

63
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:26,019
to him. Asami though did. It was a simple but effective tactic. What?

64
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:04,309
All right. So it didn't know what to do with that. It didn't know what to do with that.

65
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:12,570
It just, we got the first sentence and then it went on some fucking fan fiction.

66
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:20,870
All right. Keep reading. I'm not, I'm not going to read that. I'm going to break a rule here.

67
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:39,059
I'm not going to break any rules, okay? Here, here you go.

68
00:11:05,529 --> 00:11:18,330
This music doesn't fit. The wonderful world of classical English music. Okay, here we go.

69
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:23,690
I'm not going to break any rules here, but I was also not interested,

70
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:27,129
says Mr. Bostrom, who was appointed professor of management at Harvard Business School

71
00:11:27,129 --> 00:11:31,370
in 1999. So I went to a meeting with a group of distinguished men at the end of this trip,

72
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:35,460
which was chaired by Mark Zuckerberg. Zuckerberg's proposal on a research budget

73
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:39,480
of a hundred billion dollars was clearly the most promising way forward for the young

74
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:43,559
scientist whose main motivation for taking the job was to learn how to build big,

75
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:49,500
computerized software. It was an obvious choice. The prospect of sitting near the most successful

76
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:54,059
people in the world and taking their advice meant I had long interesting life and I loved

77
00:11:54,059 --> 00:11:58,539
it, he says. But that doesn't mean I am completely comfortable writing about it.

78
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:03,399
One day I got an email from Facebook asking if I would like to do something to write

79
00:12:03,399 --> 00:12:08,700
a book on them. There were some early issues to confront too, with Mr. Bostrom describing

80
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:12,779
how he was told by another engineer that the company wanted a prospective candidate.

81
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:17,340
He accepted it. Boring! Boring! Snooze!

82
00:12:56,179 --> 00:13:05,429
Okay. German streams suck. He has less than 5,000 viewers. The show could have been less

83
00:13:05,429 --> 00:13:47,480
racist. And less racist. This is where I will go on a rant. Why? Why? Why? Okay.

84
00:13:48,039 --> 00:14:03,139
German is a good person. Don't believe the internet. Okay. Here we go. Turn it on. This

85
00:14:03,139 --> 00:14:20,139
is like fucking scary music. We need something happy. Oh, this music sucks. Who cares? The

86
00:14:20,139 --> 00:14:30,139
rainforest. Who cares? German is a good person. Don't believe the internet. That girl

87
00:14:30,139 --> 00:14:33,419
in the bathroom at work is probably just mad that you broke her laptop. Not me.

88
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:38,740
This post has two things in common with the old. If you're an asshole, you probably can't do

89
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:47,110
anything right. Mentality. Both are not really true at all. Most of- What the fuck?

90
00:14:52,629 --> 00:15:05,059
Most of- Why? Why? Why? I'm going to write an assembly's play on- Why? No!

91
00:15:06,019 --> 00:15:15,559
How do you take- You can't take this one. You can't fucking ruin me with this one.

92
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:32,019
You cannot possibly take that anywhere.

93
00:15:32,659 --> 00:15:39,500
Germa is made out of metal dust. But you don't need to play Blood Moon. It's a solid

94
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:44,460
guard. But the most important part of this deck is lightning storm. Not only can you

95
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:48,379
discard the rest of your creatures to your hand as well as the removal from it, you can

96
00:15:48,379 --> 00:15:52,379
also play it whenever it comes up so that you keep the lightning bolts even in the first

97
00:15:52,379 --> 00:15:58,220
place. Well, I did not take the opportunity to compare this with something like Blue

98
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:03,179
Sun's Zenith. It's really interesting that the two cards have something in common with

99
00:16:03,179 --> 00:16:08,379
the colorless artifact mana. And while I didn't mention the combo card in that card's

100
00:16:08,379 --> 00:16:13,179
description, this does come with the potential for huge value. The first time you get

101
00:16:13,179 --> 00:16:17,259
lightning bolt, you're going to get one-shotted by a red creature and a blue creature from

102
00:16:17,259 --> 00:16:21,820
your side, depending on how much damage your opponent has from your lightning bolts

103
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:25,980
and what you're using to do that. In fact, if you want even more lightning bolt, you

104
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:30,379
can use Blood Moon's ability to discard your lightning bolts once the opponent's life

105
00:16:30,379 --> 00:16:45,269
total drops to zero. Why are they always- okay, why are they like exceptionally boring

106
00:16:45,269 --> 00:17:37,380
or horrible? We're gonna find out. Okay, here we go.

107
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:48,140
Sometimes I ponder life's mysteries. Are hippos actually aggressive? I keep hearing

108
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:53,019
they're the most vicious, but is it really true? Is the King Kong actually afraid of

109
00:17:53,099 --> 00:17:58,460
women? Is the dinosaur really so strong? Does a chicken actually poop? Are the birds

110
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:02,859
really friendly to each other? Can I actually talk to a chick? Does our planet actually

111
00:18:02,859 --> 00:18:07,500
exist? I'm curious. If I want to learn about these things, I think I'd have to

112
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:12,539
ask them. I've read about them. They're all my friends. They all tell me they know.

113
00:18:12,539 --> 00:18:17,099
They're my friends, and their favorite thing is their pet dog. I'm guessing I

114
00:18:17,099 --> 00:18:22,180
don't need any more convincing. Editor's Note. This interview has been excerpt from

115
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:25,779
the novel Where to See America's Great Game by Mark C. Smith, published by the

116
00:18:25,779 --> 00:18:35,220
Penguin Press. Rant things of a crazy person.

117
00:18:40,009 --> 00:18:54,660
All right, somebody give me the German craft coffee pasta. I mean, I have to do it,

118
00:18:54,660 --> 00:19:01,829
right? I'm gonna go on a rant here about German streams lately. All right.

119
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:32,380
Mm hmm. Okay. Okay. Hello, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to episode one of

120
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:36,380
Germacraft, the series where I play Minecraft. This is going to be a single

121
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:40,299
player let's play. And when I say let's play, I use that term pretty loosely

122
00:19:40,299 --> 00:19:43,660
because I'm an idiot in this game. You're going to see lots of fails.

123
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:47,259
You're going to see lots of triumphs. At least I'm hoping. So grab yourself

124
00:19:47,259 --> 00:19:50,859
a nice hot cup of coffee, hot cup of cocoa. I got myself some apple cider

125
00:19:50,859 --> 00:19:57,609
here freshly blued. Let me take a sip. Ah, that's some good cider. All right.

126
00:19:57,609 --> 00:20:00,730
So the whole thing is pretty simple. In this game, there are three classes and

127
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:03,369
there are four different ways to play the class. The three classes have a

128
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:06,250
number of skills or attributes which can boost your character with their

129
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:09,289
attributes. Your class might get bonuses to your movement, casting

130
00:20:09,289 --> 00:20:13,849
spells, attack power, or your armor. It also has some sort of defense,

131
00:20:13,849 --> 00:20:16,890
which is essentially just armor. If your class has defensive spells,

132
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:19,930
armor, movement, attack spells, or defenses, it gets extra points or

133
00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:35,799
something like that that you might want to...

134
00:20:35,799 --> 00:20:39,019
Hello, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to episode one

135
00:20:39,019 --> 00:20:42,299
of Germacraft, the series where I play Minecraft.

136
00:20:42,299 --> 00:20:45,660
This is going to be a single player let's play. And by let's play, I use

137
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:48,779
that term pretty loosely because I'm an idiot in this game.

138
00:20:48,779 --> 00:20:52,299
You're going to see lots of fails, lots of triumphs. At least I'm hoping.

139
00:20:52,299 --> 00:20:55,259
But I'll leave it to the players to decide what is and what isn't. I'll

140
00:20:55,259 --> 00:20:57,980
just do my best to make them as successful as possible. The first

141
00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:02,519
episode of Germacraft is entitled Broke. If you've seen the last few

142
00:21:02,519 --> 00:21:05,319
episodes then you know this isn't a one-man show or anything.

143
00:21:05,319 --> 00:21:08,599
And the player is very involved to make sure that people play well with each

144
00:21:08,599 --> 00:21:10,759
other. I'm going to be focusing on new players

145
00:21:10,759 --> 00:21:13,400
and how they should be taught the ropes and how to get themselves into

146
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:16,839
some bad situations. And since we're only one player, let's

147
00:21:16,839 --> 00:21:20,440
focus on one topic today. You've been warned! I won't use wasted

148
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:39,380
time or similar terms. Hello, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to

149
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:43,460
episode one of Germacraft, the series where I play Minecraft.

150
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:46,500
I've been playing mostly since beta 2.5 and this year I'm having a huge

151
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:49,140
improvement because this summer I've been having some issues

152
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:52,019
I know quite a bit about. I've been trying different things for the sake of

153
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:55,299
my gaming to fix them. Like I've lost my PC and

154
00:21:55,299 --> 00:21:58,180
internet for eight weeks. I've learned so much about how to

155
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:00,809
deal with my system and improve my gaming.

156
00:22:00,809 --> 00:22:03,369
It's been really useful learning a plethora of things about my own

157
00:22:03,369 --> 00:22:05,049
system while I'm dealing with a lot of

158
00:22:05,049 --> 00:22:09,589
issues and glitches. I'll try to update some of this as I go along.

159
00:22:09,589 --> 00:22:17,640
The topic of this week, how to reset games, how to use console patch, etc.

160
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:20,519
I'm getting better as a programmer when it comes to my own hardware and

161
00:22:20,519 --> 00:22:23,640
software. I've been able to get through to my

162
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:26,599
computer since it works so well with me now.

163
00:22:26,599 --> 00:22:30,039
Now to see how I did it. What I've been playing. Minecraft 1.7.

164
00:22:30,039 --> 00:23:11,539
I've been playing since 2.5. Minecraft 1.7.

165
00:23:11,539 --> 00:23:18,339
This is just like nonsense. I can't even read that one.

166
00:23:18,339 --> 00:23:34,119
What is this? So is the stream.

167
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:45,289
Does anybody have the whole thing? All right, here we go.

168
00:23:45,289 --> 00:23:50,680
All right. My father was fairly wealthy.

169
00:23:50,680 --> 00:24:09,369
And here's why.

170
00:24:09,769 --> 00:24:14,839
All right, here we go. My father was fairly wealthy.

171
00:24:14,839 --> 00:24:17,880
He would sometimes come home and shower us with gifts.

172
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:21,940
Various toys, trinkets, and the like. My father also brought us something

173
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:26,500
else to the house. Animals. Lots of animals. You see, he

174
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:30,740
was a zoologist by trade. The money was great. We had an entire

175
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:34,599
zoo in our backyard. But over the years one would say

176
00:24:34,599 --> 00:24:39,180
sharing a bed with a giraffe is not so great after a while.

177
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:45,559
We grew distant, him and I. The last time I spoke with him was July of 2006.

178
00:24:45,559 --> 00:24:50,329
And here's why. We weren't even friends after our divorce.

179
00:24:50,329 --> 00:25:00,440
We were never friends. We were separated by so many years of love.

180
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:08,009
We still talk about it every day. And as I said before, we still see each

181
00:25:08,009 --> 00:25:12,279
other occasionally. Like once a year. We talk when we are

182
00:25:12,279 --> 00:25:16,839
out on the town. We don't talk every day because I have classes.

183
00:25:16,839 --> 00:25:21,000
No! I have to be at work or in the shop. In a couple years we'll be able

184
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:44,420
to speak again. Possibly. God damn it.

185
00:25:44,420 --> 00:26:28,259
Okay, it's time. It's time, guys. I'm gonna try.

186
00:26:28,259 --> 00:26:42,950
This is too stupid for me to... Hey bro, uh, you need some help with those weights?

187
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:45,910
I could give you a spotty grade on that subject.

188
00:26:45,910 --> 00:26:49,589
But don't worry, uh, I won't get mad if you get, uh, something in. You know,

189
00:26:49,589 --> 00:26:53,509
I've seen you fight. You know, just watch that leg kick.

190
00:26:53,509 --> 00:26:56,710
You won't be able to keep your pants on forever.

191
00:26:56,710 --> 00:27:00,390
What? And just before you did that, you had him drop off the top bar of his

192
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:21,500
own chair? It's fucking porn again. What the

193
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:52,339
fuck? This is like bad. Okay, you look like shaggy today.

194
00:27:52,339 --> 00:27:57,049
Maybe I should change my shirt. Should I go put another shirt on?

195
00:27:57,049 --> 00:28:04,630
All right, here we go. No, I don't think this is public

196
00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:12,180
information. No, I'm keeping it on. twitch.tv revenue

197
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:14,980
earnings call, to which she replied that she does not have any data to

198
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:17,829
back up the claims. On Monday, the company announced that

199
00:28:17,829 --> 00:28:20,309
it made 2.9 billion in revenue last year,

200
00:28:20,309 --> 00:28:23,349
beating wall street projections of 1 billion to 2 billion.

201
00:28:23,349 --> 00:28:28,700
Due largely to its strong audience. On Tuesday, Twitch's third quarter earnings

202
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:31,900
showed that the number of paying members rose slightly to 10 million

203
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:36,599
from 10 million. In total revenue, Twitch added 14.8 million,

204
00:28:36,599 --> 00:28:40,950
down from 15.9 million in the same quarter of last year.

205
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:44,309
Reed Moran wore for Twitch battle the real-time chat platform fights to

206
00:28:44,309 --> 00:28:47,480
survive. In an interview posted to a Twitch

207
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:49,640
page on Wednesday, she denied that this was down

208
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:52,920
to a rise in revenue. However, she added that this doesn't mean that all

209
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:56,119
of Twitch's growth was down to higher viewership.

210
00:28:56,119 --> 00:28:58,680
It does mean that more people have an opportunity to create and share better

211
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:02,519
looking streams, such as in the photo series below. If so,

212
00:29:02,519 --> 00:29:04,680
Twitch will need to work to generate that stream

213
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:12,890
without being seen as a video game's video. This is real?

214
00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:30,009
I don't know. Okay, Otto's Big Adventure?

215
00:29:30,009 --> 00:29:34,180
Okay, we'll do Otto's Big Adventure. Did anybody have the

216
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:57,140
transcript? Do the rats? Yeah, I'll do the rats.

217
00:29:57,140 --> 00:30:09,299
Okay, rats? We're rats. We're the rats. We pray at night.

218
00:30:09,299 --> 00:30:19,589
We stalk at night. We're the rats.

219
00:30:19,589 --> 00:30:50,339
What? Rats? We're rats. We're the rats. There we are. Rats.

220
00:30:50,339 --> 00:30:55,460
We're rats. We're the rats. We pray at night. We stalk at night.

221
00:30:55,460 --> 00:31:00,490
We're the rats. So if you want kids around when they're kids and they're

222
00:31:00,490 --> 00:31:03,690
living in a cave, that's fine, but don't let them walk

223
00:31:03,690 --> 00:31:42,920
around in leather jackets and beards and run around where...

224
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:47,400
read it! No, it could be taken... somebody could take this out of context

225
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:52,119
and like clip me and put it on like fucking sickos.org

226
00:31:52,119 --> 00:32:41,319
or whatever. I don't know. Okay, let's get a

227
00:32:41,319 --> 00:32:53,369
appropriate song here. Didn't work? It doesn't... it won't do it.

228
00:32:53,369 --> 00:32:59,910
Maybe it's the... yeah, it might be the... it might have to delete that.

229
00:32:59,910 --> 00:33:14,039
Okay, here we go. Let me get this on here.

230
00:33:14,039 --> 00:33:17,559
I am the strongest. I will show you. My power level's been rising for

231
00:33:17,559 --> 00:33:20,710
centuries now.

232
00:33:23,579 --> 00:33:27,420
It was a scene I had watched hundreds of times. What is more than

233
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:30,539
what? That one man could get it but only one woman?

234
00:33:30,539 --> 00:33:42,710
That's what happens with men too. You must...

235
00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:51,400
You will know it. Don't worry. Just do what I say and letting...

236
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:55,339
I'm so conscious that this is gonna be like fucking...

237
00:33:55,500 --> 00:34:05,210
Okay, yeah, you're right. I fucked it all up.

238
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:08,570
I'm sorry. I just keep... like when it starts like that

239
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:13,659
like I feel like I'm gonna get down here and it's gonna be fucking heinous.

240
00:34:13,659 --> 00:34:37,340
Don't be such a coward. I didn't know...

241
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:42,730
Guys, here's the problem. I should have seen this coming from a mile away.

242
00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:46,809
There's more porn and more like porno and

243
00:34:46,809 --> 00:34:53,429
fucking weirdo fan fiction on the internet than ants on earth.

244
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:59,690
So, um, it's pulling from all kinds of places.

245
00:34:59,690 --> 00:35:11,019
Okay, here we go. I am the strongest. I will show you. My power level has

246
00:35:11,019 --> 00:35:15,099
risen. It's been rising for centuries now.

247
00:35:28,170 --> 00:35:33,659
Raw pace data. The only true hero in this world.

248
00:35:40,059 --> 00:35:57,019
I probably just like woke up the whole house at 2 p.m.

249
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:06,389
We fucking sleep, man. We'd like to sleep. Here we go.

250
00:36:07,989 --> 00:36:32,059
I am the strongest. I will show you. My power level has been rising for

251
00:36:32,059 --> 00:36:32,940
centuries now.

252
00:36:35,909 --> 00:36:39,590
The rest. If you're really strong, then it is obvious you could become a

253
00:36:39,590 --> 00:36:44,789
mighty hero. And don't hold back. The one who will save your life is you.

254
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:49,929
I should have done more research for that, you know. I would have seen even

255
00:36:49,929 --> 00:36:54,329
researched your strength for the master. If you are still in the same state you

256
00:36:54,329 --> 00:36:57,050
were earlier, then I will save you from danger.

257
00:36:58,579 --> 00:37:00,739
Oh, I won't be afraid if I get rid of him.

258
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:05,860
I suddenly heard the sound of an explosion from within the tunnel.

259
00:37:10,010 --> 00:37:14,010
It looks like Noir is about to make a move against us. I heard you were

260
00:37:14,010 --> 00:37:19,210
already looking for them. But I see here they go, Noir. Oh, there's a

261
00:37:19,210 --> 00:37:23,929
certain Noir mage right there along with Kurururu. Kurururu? Who are these

262
00:37:23,929 --> 00:37:26,090
people? How are they and why did they come?

263
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:35,349
My sweet child, focus your energy. Forget about what is happening

264
00:37:35,349 --> 00:37:41,909
around you. Go inside into your mind. Connect all the dots and put forward

265
00:37:41,909 --> 00:37:45,750
the power that you know is inside of that brain of yours.

266
00:37:47,159 --> 00:38:40,119
Just like that. Boom! He's going off script. Oh, so cool. Okay, here we go.

267
00:38:51,699 --> 00:38:58,579
Anime really isn't any good. There are like three good animes and two are

268
00:38:58,579 --> 00:39:03,219
the worst. A good anime is hard to find, especially on Netflix,

269
00:39:03,219 --> 00:39:07,420
because it sucks to see it all the time. Well, I'm here to make a good

270
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:11,639
anime. A good anime is like the movie of the week. It's probably the

271
00:39:11,639 --> 00:39:17,219
only show I can watch, even while waiting for the next episode. That's

272
00:39:17,219 --> 00:39:20,659
how I feel about this anime and how I feel about nearly everything else on

273
00:39:20,659 --> 00:39:25,429
Netflix. It's too big for me and I don't want to watch other shows or watch TV

274
00:39:25,429 --> 00:39:29,909
with an empty mind. So just imagine if my least favorite, my last favorite

275
00:39:29,909 --> 00:39:33,750
anime wasn't, I don't know if I want to watch this on TV anymore.

276
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:36,329
I'd be like, how can you even fucking expect me to be entertained

277
00:39:36,329 --> 00:39:40,119
when it's all over the place? So here I am watching this new episode

278
00:39:40,119 --> 00:39:44,519
in my sleep. If it sounds really weird, you've got to understand

279
00:39:44,519 --> 00:39:48,630
there's nothing weird. I've actually been here before. I'm pretty sure

280
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:53,590
this has taken place to a random room somewhere in Tokyo. What?

281
00:39:53,590 --> 00:40:21,989
Let's see the other side of the coin there. Come on, we've got to check

282
00:40:21,989 --> 00:40:39,559
them both. No, this is just more of just nonsense. This one is really

283
00:40:39,559 --> 00:40:49,019
going, it's still going. God damn it. Okay. Anime is so good,

284
00:40:49,019 --> 00:40:53,030
every anime is worth watching, but the real art form that makes me laugh

285
00:40:53,030 --> 00:41:00,739
is the show progresses as the show is when they finally do.

286
00:41:00,739 --> 00:41:05,699
Anime is so good, every anime is worth watching, but the real art form

287
00:41:05,699 --> 00:41:09,380
that makes me laugh as the show progresses is when they finally do take

288
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:13,059
a look at the plot line with characters that can't say the same thing about it

289
00:41:13,059 --> 00:41:18,170
as they say what makes it funny. Funny?

290
00:41:18,170 --> 00:41:20,650
I can easily watch some of the most beloved shows with this level of

291
00:41:20,650 --> 00:41:23,769
understanding and come to the conclusion that it is because a

292
00:41:23,769 --> 00:41:27,940
character can't say the same thing, as long as there is a twist.

293
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:32,539
It makes no sense and it's all part of a plot. For those movies that

294
00:41:32,539 --> 00:41:35,860
have gone this route that they can't take the character to

295
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:40,760
explain the story to make it laughable, well, they just plain missed the boat.

296
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:44,519
Even so, this was really interesting and interesting in some ways

297
00:41:44,519 --> 00:41:47,719
and it reminded me of other anime that I had never seen that didn't go

298
00:41:47,719 --> 00:41:51,159
the approach of writing characters that can't say what makes the plot so

299
00:41:51,159 --> 00:41:54,760
funny. Helpful is where it gets interesting.

300
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:58,599
In fact, this aspect is so unique to anime that when I say that I love

301
00:41:58,599 --> 00:42:00,760
this series, I can easily watch some of the

302
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:32,150
most beloved shows with this. This background music. Look out behind

303
00:42:32,309 --> 00:42:57,000
you, the monster is in the room. Hold on. We need to up the ante a

304
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:13,030
little bit here. Get up the ante a little. No, no

305
00:43:13,030 --> 00:43:38,920
thunderstorm. I feel like this one's gonna be pretty good.

306
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:47,739
Where's the audio? Here we go. Look up behind you, the monster is

307
00:43:47,739 --> 00:43:51,929
in the room. You can do something about it. I know the drill. When the

308
00:43:51,929 --> 00:43:56,230
monster attacks you, call 911. When was the last time that you

309
00:43:56,230 --> 00:44:01,429
used those phrases in public? This is very different than police

310
00:44:01,429 --> 00:44:04,900
officers. The police in New York have been very aggressive lately in trying

311
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:09,510
to get me to talk about this, and it won't do. If you got a problem,

312
00:44:09,510 --> 00:44:12,900
talk to the authorities. Not my lawyer and not my attorney general,

313
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:17,050
not my U.S. senators. Talk to me and listen. You're not going to get

314
00:44:17,050 --> 00:44:20,409
people in jail or in handcuffs or on trial or even in jail,

315
00:44:20,409 --> 00:44:23,610
but I'm going to get the person who did the real assault behind bars.

316
00:44:23,610 --> 00:44:29,139
He's a very dangerous guy who's no business out here. I will not allow

317
00:44:29,139 --> 00:44:32,019
you to threaten me with your gun and your words if you're going to do

318
00:44:32,019 --> 00:44:36,789
that. I'm so worried that if I don't talk or say my piece, this was

319
00:44:36,789 --> 00:44:50,309
probably out of control, and I will talk to my attorney general.

320
00:44:50,309 --> 00:45:03,929
How do I? Oh, the huge spider? The giant spider? You can't, like,

321
00:45:03,929 --> 00:45:08,699
spin. Look out behind you. The giant spider.

322
00:45:08,699 --> 00:45:16,090
I've done too many of them. What? Bridges.

323
00:45:16,090 --> 00:45:58,599
Let me play. I gotta turn this off. It's just like a dumb piano.

324
00:45:58,679 --> 00:46:11,099
I hear it. Oh, no, no. Look out behind you. The giant spider has jumped up behind you.

325
00:46:11,099 --> 00:46:15,099
Yeah, it's okay. I still hear it. Oh, you should probably just jump away from

326
00:46:15,099 --> 00:46:18,940
it. He's on the move. Oh, there's more. Yeah, he's still in

327
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:21,159
the back, so, you know, watch your step.

328
00:46:21,159 --> 00:46:24,679
No, that's not why I'm still here. You know, Bertrand and all,

329
00:46:24,679 --> 00:46:28,440
they're trying to get behind me. Don't worry, we can protect you.

330
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:32,119
Yeah, okay, that's the plan. Bertrand will do that. Yeah, you'll have to be

331
00:46:32,119 --> 00:46:35,639
patient with him, but he's the boss of this forest.

332
00:46:35,639 --> 00:46:39,030
I bet everyone is watching us if we keep on this way.

333
00:46:39,030 --> 00:46:42,150
You know why it's okay to give people the finger? They're always telling me to

334
00:46:42,150 --> 00:46:44,150
jump through hoops. They don't understand,

335
00:46:44,150 --> 00:47:01,579
and I don't care to explain. You've got to get the message across.

336
00:47:01,579 --> 00:47:19,000
Not, not, not. Like, aliens have taken over the Earth.

337
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:38,949
Aliens have taken over Earth. What do you do here?

338
00:47:39,030 --> 00:47:42,309
Aliens have taken over Earth's solar system.

339
00:47:42,309 --> 00:47:45,909
Humans and other races who aren't Earth are being hunted by the powerful

340
00:47:45,909 --> 00:47:50,070
beings they call the machines. However, you don't have to fear these

341
00:47:50,070 --> 00:47:53,510
new threats because you don't know about the machines yet.

342
00:47:53,510 --> 00:47:57,980
With no one to save you, no one to protect you, and no information about

343
00:47:57,980 --> 00:48:00,940
the machines, you must discover your true purpose

344
00:48:00,940 --> 00:48:05,159
and fight in the battle for humanity with the others from around the world.

345
00:48:05,159 --> 00:48:09,079
Play as a single player character or as an AI-controlled avatar

346
00:48:09,079 --> 00:48:13,159
in multiplayer battles and multiplayer battles with the AI to find out

347
00:48:13,159 --> 00:48:18,170
who you are fighting for. You will experience the story of the

348
00:48:18,170 --> 00:48:21,929
machine wars in four episodes at the beginning of the campaign by

349
00:48:21,929 --> 00:48:25,690
following a journey throughout the world of space.

350
00:48:25,690 --> 00:48:31,210
What is new? Now with Game Dogs. We have added Game Dogs to our system

351
00:48:31,210 --> 00:48:35,289
and added access to content in the game section of the website.

352
00:48:35,289 --> 00:48:38,730
You can still play on your PC or Mac using a compatible gaming device or

353
00:48:38,730 --> 00:48:43,210
a mobile OS running Chrome or Firefox. The new Game Dogs app is available on

354
00:48:43,210 --> 00:48:52,500
both iOS and Android. That was just an ad on TV. That was

355
00:48:52,500 --> 00:49:00,550
just like a two-minute YouTube ad. They pull you in with something fake

356
00:49:00,550 --> 00:49:04,440
in the beginning and then it's just a video game or just a TV show.

357
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:39,929
Actual E3 presentation. Okay, here to announce our new game at E3.

358
00:49:41,190 --> 00:49:57,690
Hold on. Wait, wait a minute. This is important. Nobody move.

359
00:49:57,690 --> 00:50:11,960
I have to find this. Oh, hold on. This is so important. I have to hold on to this.

360
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:15,079
Give it to me. Come on. I know it's here. I know it's here.

361
00:50:15,079 --> 00:50:28,099
Is this, wait, is this real? No, it's not even real.

362
00:50:31,989 --> 00:50:39,099
Fuck. It's not even real. I was, okay, never mind.

363
00:50:39,099 --> 00:50:42,659
I thought it was real. You'll see what I mean in a minute.

364
00:50:42,980 --> 00:50:59,670
I'm here to announce our new game at E3. It's called Tales from the Tomb Raider.

365
00:51:00,789 --> 00:51:04,150
You'll probably hear plenty of that from people all over in Australia.

366
00:51:04,150 --> 00:51:07,750
In the United States, it'll be called Tale from the Tomb Raider.

367
00:51:22,059 --> 00:51:35,460
I have to start over. Okay, this is going to be hard to do.

368
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:36,659
I'm going to try as hard as I can.

369
00:51:36,659 --> 00:51:53,079
I'm here to announce our new game at E3. It's called Tales from the Tomb Raider.

370
00:51:53,079 --> 00:51:55,960
You'll probably hear plenty of that from people all over in Australia.

371
00:51:56,760 --> 00:51:59,960
In the United States, it'll be called Tale from the Tomb Raider.

372
00:52:01,239 --> 00:52:03,880
It's not going to be called Tale from the Tomb Raider yet.

373
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:07,079
It's going to be called Tales from the Tomb Raider.

374
00:52:07,079 --> 00:52:21,159
I love the sound of that name. It's going to be called Tale from the Tomb Raider.

375
00:52:21,159 --> 00:52:33,110
For some sort of convention in 2014.

376
00:52:33,110 --> 00:52:35,349
The Tomb Raider title.

377
00:52:35,349 --> 00:52:39,900
I'm here to announce our new game at E3. It's called Tales from the Tomb Raider.

378
00:52:40,860 --> 00:52:43,179
I have to start over.

379
00:52:43,179 --> 00:52:50,460
I'm here to announce our new game at E3. It's called Tales from the Tomb Raider.

380
00:52:50,460 --> 00:52:52,460
You'll probably hear plenty of that from people all over in Australia.

381
00:52:53,260 --> 00:52:55,980
In the United States, it'll be called Tale from the Tomb Raider.

382
00:52:56,860 --> 00:52:59,340
No, it's not going to be called Tale from the Tomb Raider yet.

383
00:53:00,389 --> 00:53:04,550
The Tomb Raider title is being developed by a group of team members

384
00:53:04,550 --> 00:53:08,309
and they're actually talking about a new game. One of these days we're going to

385
00:53:08,309 --> 00:53:14,469
announce that game at E3 this year or soon after or maybe even early next year

386
00:53:14,469 --> 00:53:17,349
but at this point we're actually trying to convince people to actually

387
00:53:17,349 --> 00:53:22,230
buy and play the game instead of coming just to enjoy the game and see

388
00:53:22,230 --> 00:53:26,150
their own photos in its world. But as far as we know this isn't a

389
00:53:26,150 --> 00:53:39,719
sequel or a reboot right now so I know. I really like the sound of that

390
00:53:39,719 --> 00:53:57,190
name. Tale of the Tomb Raider. Tales of the Tomb Raider.

391
00:53:57,190 --> 00:54:01,829
And now ladies and gentlemen please welcome the head

392
00:54:01,829 --> 00:54:10,900
of Xbox studio Phil Spencer. Okay all right hey hey everybody how are

393
00:54:10,900 --> 00:54:17,000

394
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:25,050
cool very cool yeah uh I'm here to announce our new

395
00:54:25,050 --> 00:54:32,500
game at E3. The next game from our studio is about to be released on PC.

396
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:36,500
This is because the game is on PC and Xbox One

397
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:42,809
and due to some technical issues we can't show it in our booth.

398
00:54:42,809 --> 00:54:47,079
We believe that PC and PlayStation 4 users

399
00:54:47,079 --> 00:54:51,099
will have many more features and more fun than consoles

400
00:54:51,099 --> 00:54:55,539
so please check out the game on our forums.

401
00:54:55,539 --> 00:54:59,380
If you want to keep up to date on our progress in your favorite gaming

402
00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:02,889
platform we're looking into other projects like

403
00:55:02,889 --> 00:55:08,300
the next game in the upcoming Super Monkey Ball series.

404
00:55:08,300 --> 00:55:16,489
Thank you for reading. Thank you for reading.

405
00:55:16,489 --> 00:55:20,699
Oh that's what throws it off. Thank you for reading

and please come get to know us. We hope to see you at E3

407

this year. Thank you for reading. Phil Spencer would be backstage

408
00:55:32,659 --> 00:55:36,340
and he'd walk off people like four of his assistants would be like Phil

409
00:55:36,340 --> 00:55:40,019

410
00:55:40,019 --> 00:55:45,500
talking about? What? Super Monkey Ball. What the fuck was

411
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:48,059
going on up here? The next game from our studio is about to be released on

412
00:55:48,059 --> 00:55:52,059
PC. This is because the game is on PC and Xbox One.

413
00:55:52,059 --> 00:56:03,559
We believe that PC and PS4 users. Phil Spencer like took like three or

414
00:56:03,559 --> 00:56:10,170
four like Xanaxes and like got on stage and just started talking.

415
00:56:10,170 --> 00:56:23,739
Oh my god. We'll do another one. All right well I'll

416
00:56:23,900 --> 00:56:47,780
do Todd Howard now. This is gonna be hard to get through.

417
00:56:47,780 --> 00:56:59,460
This is gonna be really really really hard to get through.

418
00:56:59,460 --> 00:57:04,250
Ladies and gentlemen please welcome the head of Bethesda Softworks

419
00:57:04,250 --> 00:57:11,829
Todd Howard. I don't know but what does Todd sound like?

420
00:57:11,829 --> 00:57:19,159
Okay right thank you thank you so much. Look yeah fuck yeah fuck yeah

421
00:57:19,159 --> 00:57:28,940
right you know fuck yeah fuck yeah thank you thank you all right

422
00:57:28,940 --> 00:57:38,780
quiet. I'm here to announce our new game at E3.

423
00:57:38,780 --> 00:57:43,619
Yeah that's right. This new entry in the award-winning genre

424
00:57:43,619 --> 00:57:48,380
comes out on the second week of June. We're also introducing a new

425
00:57:48,380 --> 00:57:52,340
multiplayer mode known as Team Deathmatch. We haven't

426
00:57:52,340 --> 00:57:56,019
announced any details as to how this would work until now

427
00:57:56,019 --> 00:58:00,250
but it's a lot like Dominion except a little faster

428
00:58:00,250 --> 00:58:05,239
with three different modes. One has a very simple element of capture and

429
00:58:05,239 --> 00:58:09,659
hold but it's very unforgiving. The other two have a little more

430
00:58:09,659 --> 00:58:12,940
strategy in it with you controlling all three bases at

431
00:58:12,940 --> 00:58:17,269
once. If you win a match then you win

432
00:58:17,269 --> 00:58:22,230
because your team gets kills and captures all three bases together.

433
00:58:22,230 --> 00:58:26,070
At the end of the day if one of your bases is captured then it's out of

434
00:58:26,070 --> 00:58:29,349
game and you can win a bunch of coins

435
00:58:29,349 --> 00:58:32,789
which means you can take control of the rest of the game and play the

436
00:58:32,789 --> 00:58:51,460
exact same map. This portion right here I thought I was going to crack on this

437
00:58:51,460 --> 00:58:54,420
one. You're coming to E3 to announce Team

438
00:58:54,420 --> 00:59:12,250
Deathmatch? A game mode? Another one. I like these.

439
00:59:12,250 --> 00:59:40,570
One more. Okay. These are all so stupid. All right

440
00:59:40,570 --> 00:59:48,840
hold on. Ladies and gentlemen please welcome to

441
00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:54,460
the stage the president of Nintendo of America, Dave

442
00:59:54,460 --> 01:00:01,429
Bowser. Hey hey hey how are you? How's everybody

443
01:00:01,469 --> 01:00:07,559
doing? That's right. Yeah yeah yeah. Welcome everybody

444
01:00:07,559 --> 01:00:14,840
to E3. Oh yeah that's right. Let me take a look. Hey hey easy.

445
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:22,230
For the first time ever we are at E3 and let me just

446
01:00:22,230 --> 01:00:28,059
burn some time. Well the technical people.

447
01:00:28,059 --> 01:00:42,219
Yeah that's me. All right I'm here to announce our new game at E3

448
01:00:42,219 --> 01:00:45,659
after working on a lot of different things recently. We're finally getting

449
01:00:45,659 --> 01:00:49,820
ready to reveal this project. The game is called

450
01:00:49,820 --> 01:00:57,449
Witches of the Deep and it's for PC. What is Witches of the Deep?

451
01:00:57,449 --> 01:01:01,849
Witches of the Deep is the most immersive game we've made so far

452
01:01:01,849 --> 01:01:06,570
although it's not just for the PC. I would like to make this announcement

453
01:01:06,570 --> 01:01:10,409
more personally in order to let the players know.

454
01:01:10,409 --> 01:01:13,929
If you played the game or played with a friend you know what I'm talking

455
01:01:13,929 --> 01:01:16,090
about. I'm talking about the feeling of

456
01:01:16,090 --> 01:01:19,849
freedom that comes from trying something new. I hope you will have the

457
01:01:19,849 --> 01:01:23,530
same feeling. Witches of the Deep is being developed

458
01:01:23,530 --> 01:01:27,530
at the same time as a website and we will be sharing

459
01:01:27,530 --> 01:01:31,530
this title to everyone through our Facebook and Tumblr.

460
01:01:31,530 --> 01:01:36,489
The game is created entirely from the ground up by a team of game producers.

461
01:01:36,489 --> 01:01:40,460
Our story has been told so far. We are currently writing and recording

462
01:01:40,460 --> 01:01:43,500
some music and writing the final scripts of the

463
01:01:43,500 --> 01:02:14,920
music. Our goal on the release! Why would you announce an E3? I can't turn

464
01:02:14,920 --> 01:02:30,150
off the crowd.

465
01:02:31,590 --> 01:02:35,989
All right, where is this one? It's right here.

466
01:02:35,989 --> 01:03:23,239
Okay, so we are delaying our new game.

467
01:03:28,619 --> 01:03:34,469
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage Gabe Newell

468
01:03:34,469 --> 01:03:45,050
from Half-Life Softworks. Thank you, thank you everybody.

469
01:03:45,050 --> 01:03:48,900
Whoa, okay, so everybody used to settle down here.

470
01:03:48,900 --> 01:03:54,550
Okay, yes I did, no I am. Okay, very much, thank you.

471
01:03:54,550 --> 01:04:11,980
Yeah, okay, here we are. We're here. Wow, interesting, wow.

472
01:04:11,980 --> 01:04:21,539
Hold on. We are sorry we are delaying our new game

473
01:04:21,539 --> 01:04:29,940
to 2013. Yeah, I know. Not many of you here today,

474
01:04:29,940 --> 01:04:35,429
unfortunately. We're delaying our new game to 2013.

475
01:04:35,429 --> 01:04:40,780
A few days ago, a few days later, when we reached out to Warner Brothers,

476
01:04:40,780 --> 01:04:44,699
we were assured the delay would be brought under control.

477
01:04:44,699 --> 01:04:49,420
At least for now, but no further information was forthcoming.

478
01:04:49,420 --> 01:04:53,659
At some point in 2011, we also came across an official

479
01:04:53,659 --> 01:04:57,510
FAQ from Warner Brothers that stated,

480
01:04:57,510 --> 01:05:00,710
we would like to thank you for your great love and support of the Kingdom

481
01:05:00,710 --> 01:05:04,789
Hearts franchise and in a recent business decision, we

482
01:05:04,789 --> 01:05:08,869
decided that Kingdom Hearts Unchained X would not be

483
01:05:08,869 --> 01:05:12,409
going forward when the previous game was released

484
01:05:12,409 --> 01:05:18,409
and would end up on its own terms and for its own time.

485
01:05:18,409 --> 01:05:23,369
Advertisement. This is where the story started.

486
01:05:23,369 --> 01:05:26,900
A few weeks ago, Warner Brothers released a press release

487
01:05:26,900 --> 01:05:30,980
that announced a series of new games for Kingdom Hearts 2.

488
01:05:30,980 --> 01:05:34,360
One of the most popular things about Kingdom Hearts fans

489
01:05:34,440 --> 01:05:38,440
is the fact that this series takes on so many different forms,

490
01:05:38,440 --> 01:05:43,260
including the addition of a new game feature featuring a new game in Kingdom

491
01:05:43,260 --> 01:05:47,340
Hearts 2, reads the press release. This is

492
01:05:47,340 --> 01:05:54,619
precisely what we'd like to introduce in Kingdom Hearts Unchained

493
01:05:54,619 --> 01:06:07,820
and that is all. Thank you. Oh, come on. Oh, come on.

494
01:06:07,820 --> 01:06:11,639
Fuck you! Yeah, I've wanted to say it for a very long time.

495
01:06:11,639 --> 01:06:57,860
Fuck you all! How could he say something like that? No, god damn it!

496
01:06:57,860 --> 01:07:25,449
No, that's like the meme! Like, my brain just typed the thing that's the meme.

497
01:07:25,449 --> 01:07:29,099
My brain literally just typed the, like, the meme.

498
01:07:29,099 --> 01:07:42,579
The shitty meme. For some reason, like, neighbor.

499
01:07:42,579 --> 01:07:46,900
I don't know, like, E-I-G. I don't know why my brain was like, yeah, that's

500
01:07:46,900 --> 01:07:58,500
correct. That was unintentional. I'm not, I

501
01:07:58,500 --> 01:08:01,219
wouldn't be that much of a dick to Gabe. He's a fucking great guy.

502
01:08:01,219 --> 01:08:17,380
No, he's not. What? He's not? Low IQ. I blame my low IQ brain on that.

503
01:08:18,199 --> 01:08:19,960
That's not what I wanted to do. I'm just stupid.

504
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:31,210
After nine years of development, hopefully it has been worth the wait.

505
01:08:31,210 --> 01:08:34,489
My favorite part about the mod was the fact that I could just install the file

506
01:08:34,489 --> 01:08:38,170
manually into your user's username, documents,

507
01:08:38,170 --> 01:08:42,979
my games, my first action directory. You did not need to put it in any

508
01:08:42,979 --> 01:08:47,510
other location. Thanks for reading. Edit.

509
01:08:47,510 --> 01:08:51,130
I've decided not to add any of the existing mods.

510
01:08:51,130 --> 01:08:54,439
I'll start with the main one and then move on to the others.

511
01:08:54,439 --> 01:08:58,359
Also, just for funsies, I've added in a couple extra scripts

512
01:08:58,359 --> 01:09:02,329
so you can simply execute the mod just to give you more ammo.

513
01:09:02,329 --> 01:09:05,369
I will also have to rewrite the description because it's really not

514
01:09:05,369 --> 01:09:09,699
that important. Thanks again, everyone. For more

515
01:09:09,699 --> 01:09:12,659
information, please refer to the original description here,

516
01:09:12,659 --> 01:09:20,500
github.com, aurora gaming, the big boy A1V, the big boy 1AV, oddball issues.

517
01:09:20,500 --> 01:09:41,800
Why do I have scary music? I'm not, I don't want that mod.

518
01:09:49,220 --> 01:09:53,079
Click the link. I don't want, I don't know what this is. It probably didn't even

519
01:09:53,079 --> 01:10:02,489
exist anymore. I'm really like mad that I had to type

520
01:10:02,489 --> 01:10:11,460
that out like that. All right, um okay. How about, what's a

521
01:10:11,460 --> 01:10:26,840
song? And that's not a song, but you know,

522
01:10:26,840 --> 01:10:50,409
do all of basket case. What? Okay, really.

523
01:10:50,409 --> 01:10:53,689
Frogs will become an alternate reality for many, while fans will be

524
01:10:53,689 --> 01:10:57,050
disappointed to know that the series isn't returning until 2019.

525
01:10:57,050 --> 01:11:00,170
The episode opens with a brief footage of the future, including the

526
01:11:00,170 --> 01:11:04,520
time travelers themselves. The new episode will appear on

527
01:11:04,520 --> 01:11:09,000
November 16th, 2018, the same day Marvel Comics' Captain America Civil War opens

528
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:36,569
in theaters. Okay, that's an ad. When does Tale of

529
01:11:36,569 --> 01:11:43,560
the Tomb Raider release, I wonder? It's Tales of the Tomb Raider, not for

530
01:11:43,560 --> 01:12:06,100
other countries. When does Tale of the Tomb Raider

531
01:12:06,100 --> 01:12:12,699
release? Sorrowful dead drummer Billy Breathes and bassist Mike Campbell

532
01:12:12,699 --> 01:12:15,819
are excited about Tales of the Tomb Raider coming to Xbox One and

533
01:12:15,819 --> 01:12:20,060
Windows 10 in early 2016, according to guitarist Mike Campbell

534
01:12:20,060 --> 01:12:23,699
in Rolling Stone. A Microsoft representative reached out

535
01:12:23,699 --> 01:12:30,069
to EAM for an answer, but didn't take the report seriously.

536
01:12:30,069 --> 01:12:33,659
Why would Microsoft reach out for it? Why wouldn't

537
01:12:33,659 --> 01:12:37,260
the magazine reach out for an answer? Why would they

538
01:12:37,260 --> 01:12:57,109
decline a comment from Microsoft? That doesn't make any sense.

539
01:12:57,109 --> 01:13:08,010
It says Tales, but let's change it and see.

540
01:13:08,010 --> 01:13:12,939
Okay, here we go. When does Tales of the Tomb Raider release?

541
01:13:12,939 --> 01:13:16,699
Some reports say the release takes place April 25th, 2016,

542
01:13:16,779 --> 01:13:23,289
but that's only one day. At 4 p.m. Eastern time on that same day,

543
01:13:23,289 --> 01:13:27,689
we will get a notification from Valve that the vault is open for you to play

544
01:13:27,689 --> 01:13:58,420
it, according to the news release. There it is.

545
01:13:58,420 --> 01:14:03,100
Takes? Take? Take? Wait, what do you mean take? What are you talking about? What happened?

546
01:14:03,100 --> 01:14:07,819
What happened? What happened? What happened? Oh,

547
01:14:07,819 --> 01:14:16,119
whatever. Well, let's see when Tales of the Tomb Raider.

548
01:14:16,119 --> 01:14:22,310
Tales of the Tomb Raider? Tales of the Tomb Raider

549
01:14:22,310 --> 01:14:36,300
is an iPad game that is desperately trying to get you to download it.

550
01:14:36,300 --> 01:14:42,920
Okay, fine. What will...

551
01:14:43,079 --> 01:14:47,800
This is like, it's like English is my second language, apparently.

552
01:14:47,800 --> 01:14:53,739
What will Takes of the Tomb Raider be rated?

553
01:14:53,739 --> 01:15:02,659
All right. A bit different for this week's game. You see

554
01:15:02,659 --> 01:15:06,340
a few different ways that a new game is expected to be. One has to do with

555
01:15:06,340 --> 01:15:09,380
marketing, and that is by putting ads on the front page.

556
01:15:09,380 --> 01:15:13,819
Many have mentioned that a new game has to have content that will sell for free

557
01:15:13,819 --> 01:15:17,979
to make up for not getting any ads. Well, that kind

558
01:15:17,979 --> 01:15:21,899
of has to get a little boring. With this week's game and some of its other

559
01:15:21,899 --> 01:15:24,539
options, that is exactly what happens. This

560
01:15:24,539 --> 01:15:28,939
week's Take of the Tomb Raider will be the last game of the season

561
01:15:28,939 --> 01:15:32,390
that hasn't been released yet. They expect us to see the game

562
01:15:32,390 --> 01:15:35,350
come out a little bit later in January than usual,

563
01:15:35,350 --> 01:15:39,670
so hopefully by then it will have sold out. It also won't be the end of

564
01:15:39,670 --> 01:15:49,590
the season, which means it will have some free copies on sale for another few weeks.

565
01:15:49,590 --> 01:15:54,789
Take of the Tomb Raider is available for free order on Steam.

566
01:15:54,789 --> 01:15:59,659
Are they calling this the game of the week? On a somewhat related note, this

567
01:15:59,659 --> 01:16:01,659
week's game of the week are some games...

568
01:16:01,659 --> 01:16:09,539
Ah, that was all over the place. What will Tales of the Tomb Raider...

569
01:16:09,539 --> 01:16:16,500
What will Tales of the Tomb Raider be rated? I'll ask about the game of

570
01:16:16,500 --> 01:16:33,189
the week after this. Boy, what? What does this mean?

571
01:16:33,189 --> 01:16:38,229
Okay, this is weird. What will Tales of the Tomb Raider be rated?

572
01:16:38,229 --> 01:16:41,829
It will be rated T for Teen, but you'll still be able to use other

573
01:16:41,829 --> 01:16:44,939
content that's approved for older age groups.

574
01:16:44,939 --> 01:16:49,260
I'll also be allowing players 18 and up to have a non-commercial

575
01:16:49,260 --> 01:16:56,140
online game. Do I have to own Tomb...

576
01:16:57,340 --> 01:17:02,220
Just putting the blanket statement out that you're gonna allow and like

577
01:17:02,539 --> 01:17:09,640
completely and totally support like porn mods? Do I have to own the Tomb Raider game to play

578
01:17:09,640 --> 01:17:12,920
the online multiplayer? Some of the online games that already

579
01:17:12,920 --> 01:17:18,439
support multiplayer will still continue to function for players on PS3 and Xbox 360.

580
01:17:18,439 --> 01:17:23,239
However, I think there will be more content added to the servers so that they're ready

581
01:17:23,239 --> 01:17:28,619
for Xbox One. Do I have to own Tales of the Tomb Raider to play the online multiplayer?

582
01:17:28,619 --> 01:17:35,479
I'd like to say yes, but we don't have any official details on the matter just yet.

583
01:17:35,479 --> 01:17:49,880
I don't buy games. Will your Xbox Live games fail to download?

584
01:17:49,880 --> 01:17:51,640
What a stupid statement.

585
01:17:54,199 --> 01:17:59,239
As a reminder, PS3 gamers who own a PS3 can play games through the cloud

586
01:17:59,239 --> 01:18:10,619
and even download... and even download from Xbox Live in their online mode for their...

587
01:18:10,619 --> 01:18:16,859
on their PS3. This is the best one.

588
01:18:17,859 --> 01:18:24,020
I don't buy games. Will your Xbox Live games fail to download?

589
01:18:29,420 --> 01:18:35,180
That's unbelievable. I feel like that's like a fucking question that somebody has had to answer.

590
01:18:36,310 --> 01:18:39,670
Someone somewhere in some comment section or some review or something.

591
01:18:43,779 --> 01:18:57,609
All right. What's the game of the week? I don't buy games. Will your games fail to download?

592
01:19:04,520 --> 01:19:17,029
Okay. What is the game of the week?

593
01:19:21,060 --> 01:19:26,010
No, no. Game of the week.

594
01:19:27,140 --> 01:19:30,979
Week one, team opponent point scores. Score by points, points by.

595
01:19:31,539 --> 01:19:35,939
With the total seven points from New England Jets at the New Orleans Saints.

596
01:19:36,970 --> 01:19:42,659
Minus 4.513 minus 2677 to the Jacksonville Jaguars at the Oakland Raiders.

597
01:19:42,659 --> 01:19:45,859
Seven point five points from the Tennessee Titans at Houston, Texas.

598
01:19:45,859 --> 01:19:50,340
We had the Kansas City Chiefs. Point four five thirteen thirteen five seventy seven.

599
01:19:51,619 --> 01:19:53,140
There's no New England Jets.

600
01:19:55,380 --> 01:19:57,380
They're all playing at the same time.

601
01:20:01,420 --> 01:20:06,140
Chicago Bears at the Dallas Cowboys at the Miami Dolphins. They scored seven points on the field

602
01:20:06,939 --> 01:20:11,739
against the Denver Broncos who also at the same time were playing at the Minnesota Vikings

603
01:20:11,739 --> 01:20:15,739
who scored negative eight points during the same time period versus the Jacksonville Jaguars

604
01:20:15,739 --> 01:20:19,659
who were also at the Carolina Panthers versus the Los Angeles Chargers.

605
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:25,340
The Washington Redskins were versus the New England Patriots and they scored

606
01:20:25,340 --> 01:20:29,819
two touchdowns, 20 minus seven. And then they were also playing the Washington Red...

607
01:20:29,819 --> 01:20:36,060
No, the Indianapolis Colts versus the Tampa Bay Buccaneers who scored latitude 15,

608
01:20:36,060 --> 01:20:39,659
longitude 17 at the New Orleans Saints versus the Atlanta Falcons and versus the Tennessee

609
01:20:39,659 --> 01:20:47,380
Titans. Every single team played at the same time. Tennessee played themselves.

610
01:20:52,789 --> 01:20:57,720
Wait, the Tennessee Titans. There's no New England Jets.

611
01:20:58,649 --> 01:21:02,409
So the New England Jets won the game. Did...

612
01:21:02,409 --> 01:21:06,489
Okay. The only way that's as possible is that this is like 500 people on the field at the same

613
01:21:06,489 --> 01:21:14,659
time. So the New England Patriots and the Jets made one team during this mess and decided to be

614
01:21:14,659 --> 01:21:28,819
on the same team and like switch shirts and stuff. Every single team played. All right.

615
01:21:28,819 --> 01:21:42,279
What's the game of the week? Give us a video game. What's the video game of the week?

616
01:21:42,279 --> 01:22:03,020
Write dialogue. It's thinking. What the fuck is this? This is... No, this is just... No,

617
01:22:03,020 --> 01:22:10,300
we need video game. What is the video game? What is the video game of the week?

618
01:22:10,300 --> 01:22:27,460
I don't want to do any more coordinate spreads. I don't... Is this even...

619
01:22:49,779 --> 01:22:58,729
Hey guys, what's the video game of the week? It's a little different each week.

Is this made up? Just predictive, made up words? Big Bang Theory.

631
01:24:14,869 --> 01:24:28,659
What is the PS4 game of the week? What are the best games of the year?

632
01:24:28,659 --> 01:24:48,869
And then the next one is going to be who won the Oscar? Who is? No, I'm not. Okay, well,

633
01:24:48,869 --> 01:24:59,640
we'll try it. What are the best games of the year for 2014? I don't think you can make a

634
01:24:59,640 --> 01:25:04,539
claim for best video game ever. There are so many that are quite excellent, whether that's

635
01:25:04,539 --> 01:25:09,340
Uncharted, Bioshock, or Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. Games like Splinter Cell Blacklist, Grand Theft

636
01:25:09,340 --> 01:25:14,779
Auto V, Forza, Motorsport 6 all seem to have their fair share of fans. I think it's

637
01:25:14,779 --> 01:25:21,500
really an amazing year. What do you think about 2014's big tech releases? I don't necessarily know,

638
01:25:21,500 --> 01:25:26,760
but when I go to see the big tech stuff, it just feels better than what I normally get. I mean,

639
01:25:26,760 --> 01:25:31,000
I'm not saying GTA V is a great release. I'm more saying that it's definitely the best GTA

640
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:35,189
game to date, and it's got some very cool features. I definitely enjoy the new things

641
01:25:35,189 --> 01:25:39,750
like split screen for the best in business racing games, but obviously, what are you

642
01:25:39,750 --> 01:25:44,340
really playing? What you're really playing is Grand Theft Auto. That's when you're playing

643
01:25:44,340 --> 01:25:49,619
against other gamers online through Grand Theft Auto Online or against other racers by others.

644
01:25:49,619 --> 01:25:58,699
So it's really... I definitely enjoy the new things like split screen for the best in the

645
01:25:58,699 --> 01:26:06,819
business racing games, but obviously what you're really playing is Grand Theft Auto. This isn't

646
01:26:06,819 --> 01:26:58,569
fake. Best in the business. Taking a while for this one. Is this... I don't know if this is real.

647
01:26:59,449 --> 01:27:06,630
I don't think this is real. I have no idea if this is real, but I'm gonna go for it. Is it?

648
01:27:06,630 --> 01:27:15,979
I don't know. Okay. Who won the Oscar? Oscar winner Joaquin Phoenix is not nominated for an

649
01:27:15,979 --> 01:27:21,340
Academy Award, despite him getting an ovation by a capacity crowd at Thursday's Tony Awards.

650
01:27:21,899 --> 01:27:26,460
The 42-year-old actor received a standing ovation and applause throughout the ceremony,

651
01:27:26,460 --> 01:27:30,699
with other celebrities including Lady Gaga, Miley Cyrus, and Jennifer Hudson also receiving

652
01:27:30,699 --> 01:27:35,479
special guests this evening. Phoenix has been nominated in numerous categories over

653
01:27:35,479 --> 01:27:39,960
the past 10 years, most recently for the best performance in an ensemble cast including Bill

654
01:27:39,960 --> 01:27:45,460
Murray, Tom Hanks, Jason Robards, and Julianne Moore. However, as much as that might be a bit

655
01:27:45,460 --> 01:27:50,899
of a surprise, Phoenix has always held a particular soft spot in the hearts of young

656
01:27:50,899 --> 01:27:56,310
actors, and in particular in a group of aspiring Hollywood stars. This is partly because

657
01:27:56,310 --> 01:28:03,029
Phoenix plays Dr. Phil on a CBS program called The Talk, and in 2006 the singer made

658
01:28:03,029 --> 01:28:08,310
headlines for being spotted in a pair of suit jacket and ties after attending a performance of

659
01:28:08,310 --> 01:28:13,420
the movie Walking with Dinosaurs. I got the biggest standing ovation this evening's

660
01:28:13,420 --> 01:28:28,789
Tony Awards, and I haven't walked. Joaquin Phoenix, does he play Dr. Phil? No, does he?

661
01:28:35,880 --> 01:28:45,619
I got the biggest standing ovation, and I haven't even walked. He does? No, what do

662
01:28:45,619 --> 01:29:17,560
you mean? Dr. Phil is... he does. What? What if one word just says no? Yeah, that'd be funny.

663
01:29:19,020 --> 01:29:46,840
Stop the questions. I like the questions. Oh, wait, wait, wait. Does German 985 deserve...

664
01:30:02,890 --> 01:30:27,300
What the fuck is this? Does German 985 deserve... Dan Olson, I hate people who play

665
01:30:27,300 --> 01:30:31,609
video games. The Tesseract, I'm actually starting to find my preferred method of dealing

666
01:30:31,609 --> 01:30:37,859
with video games to be going to an indie game jam. LOL, good times from Ian Chong. Yep,

667
01:30:37,859 --> 01:31:23,579
he's cool. It's you guys talking. The best part of the... Folgers, right? Is there a D there? Is

668
01:31:23,579 --> 01:31:32,760
it like Folgers? Is it folders? Folgers? No, it's Folgers with a G.

669
01:31:59,960 --> 01:32:06,020
The best part of waking up is Folgers in your cup. They have a great assortment of

670
01:32:06,020 --> 01:32:11,239
fresh and dried fruits and veggies and delicious sandwiches. So good. The rest of the day we drove

671
01:32:11,239 --> 01:32:15,659
to the river park and enjoyed some paddle boarding and kayaking. We ended up on the

672
01:32:15,659 --> 01:32:20,199
south side of the park, which is where we stayed while we were out. We found the place

673
01:32:20,199 --> 01:32:24,199
nice and cool and we walked all the way through the park to the north side where we stopped

674
01:32:24,199 --> 01:32:28,380
for breakfast. To make up for the delay, the driver decided to take our bags out back,

675
01:32:28,380 --> 01:32:33,829
which was a surprise. She was like, oh no, you know, that's not a car park you're on.

676
01:32:33,829 --> 01:32:40,180
Let's try our next stop. But the whole time we were walking, it was super cute, even in a bad mood.

677
01:32:40,180 --> 01:32:44,180
It's actually really nice to stay in this area, as it's closer to home and it's closer to my

678
01:32:44,180 --> 01:32:49,060
apartment and my parents. I think because this area is much less busy than any other area when

679
01:32:49,060 --> 01:33:15,159
I'm around. By the end of the morning I started to... It's a normie blog. Hey, no,

680
01:33:15,159 --> 01:33:52,630
my going kayaking. Don't go, stay here. I got it, I can do it. Don't move.

681
01:33:52,869 --> 01:34:13,369
Ahem, welcome to the Nintendo Direct E3 2014. The first big announcement of E3 2014 was a new

682
01:34:13,369 --> 01:34:18,170
updated version of its website dedicated to Nintendo, along with the official trailer

683
01:34:18,170 --> 01:34:22,090
for Animal Crossing, New Leaf, and Super Smash Brothers for the Wii U and Xbox One

684
01:34:22,090 --> 01:34:28,119
and PlayStation 4. A new Nintendo Direct is held now, which is the culmination of two

685
01:34:28,119 --> 01:34:34,119
weeks long events from October 26th to the 31st. The two days are spent on presentations,

686
01:34:34,199 --> 01:34:39,210
demos, and interviews with Nintendo on a number of topics. With this Direct still in the early

687
01:34:39,210 --> 01:34:44,810
stages, we've gathered a list of the best of the best announcements as reported by media,

688
01:34:44,810 --> 01:34:48,710
as well as some of the best news that was revealed in the videos. You can expect to know

689
01:34:48,710 --> 01:34:52,949
what Nintendo has in store for us before all the rest of you have been given what you've

690
01:34:52,949 --> 01:35:01,340
paid for over the last year. For our coverage from E3, please use the links below as our

01:35:01,340 --> 01:35:08,420

01:35:08,420 --> 01:35:45,979
subscribe, rate, and comment below. Mario Maker 2 is in its third version of its popular Mario

693
01:35:45,979 --> 01:35:51,979
game series since the 2014. Released on the Wii U, Nintendo 3DS, and Nintendo 3DS XL,

694
01:35:52,539 --> 01:35:57,979
the game was announced on Monday and went on sale earlier this month as part of a weekend

695
01:35:57,979 --> 01:36:02,859
bundle deal. It's not surprising the games have struggled to make its mark on consumers

696
01:36:02,859 --> 01:36:08,859
after its 2014 release, with many fans questioning how Mario Maker will hold up to later,

697
01:36:08,859 --> 01:36:14,380
more mature versions of the series. Now, Microsoft is trying to remedy that problem

698
01:36:14,380 --> 01:36:20,659
by releasing the new version of Minecraft. See more on Nintendo Switch launch bundle.

699
01:36:20,659 --> 01:36:27,220
The new version of Minecraft, dubbed Minecraft 6.3, has been released for the Xbox One this

700
01:36:27,220 --> 01:36:32,899
weekend and is part of a Microsoft exclusive weekend promotion. Minecraft 6.3 is the first

701
01:36:32,899 --> 01:36:38,260
version of the game released for Windows 8 or Windows Store 8.1 and also supports the

702
01:36:38,260 --> 01:36:46,220
new Nintendo 3DS XL gamepad. However, the new version also requires players to upgrade to the

703
01:36:46,220 --> 01:36:54,149
new Nintendo Switch console. And Nintendo says that is why players can no longer jump into

704
01:36:54,149 --> 01:37:08,279
Minecraft with Minecraft 1.1 installed and running. Minecraft 6.3 by the way. The new Nintendo

705
01:37:08,279 --> 01:37:25,350
3DS XL gamepad. Quick, quick, quick, come on. No, people are leaving. What's storefront?

706
01:37:33,529 --> 01:37:40,680
Oh boy. Yoshi is returning in Nintendogs. We'll get to see him in this week's update.

707
01:37:40,680 --> 01:37:44,600
So look for us to keep you updated on how he reacts to our new characters.

708
01:37:44,680 --> 01:38:08,380
Yoshi in Nintendogs. You don't have to go see the direct. Come on, come on, come on.

709
01:38:13,640 --> 01:38:21,560
Okay, okay, okay. Star Fox. Big Star Fox announcement here. Star Fox Switch has been

710
01:38:21,560 --> 01:38:28,409
delayed due by the Nicholas team's ongoing support for Pokemon Go. They're pushing on

711
01:38:28,409 --> 01:38:32,409
with development of the upcoming title and the team is also hard at work securing more

712
01:38:32,409 --> 01:38:37,829
games to the platform, including an announcement. For years, game developers have relied on the

713
01:38:37,829 --> 01:38:44,090
popularity of Pokemon Go and other applications to secure funding from Nintendo for development.

714
01:38:44,090 --> 01:38:49,539
Nicholas will also be working on more projects that are not the core title but specialized

715
01:38:49,539 --> 01:38:55,319
like a Pokemon game. In fact, if a game is licensed and released and has a dedicated

716
01:38:55,319 --> 01:39:00,420
platform, you can count on Nicholas to be working on these. And it'll be interesting

717
01:39:00,420 --> 01:39:06,180
to see what projects Nicholas works on next and what its next titles include. It's worth

718
01:39:06,180 --> 01:39:11,000
noting that Pokemon Go's success can also be attributed to its mobile and gaming versions,

719
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:15,000
allowing users to get in, out, and interact with Pokemon in different ways.

720
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:19,399
The game even takes the same approaches to Pokemon related items with its item collecting

721
01:39:19,399 --> 01:39:25,479
mechanics, including using Pokestops as an in-app store and in-app purchases user interface

722
01:39:25,479 --> 01:39:45,369
where users can... it's just Pokemon. Can I stream the direct? Am I allowed to do that?

723
01:39:45,369 --> 01:40:03,140
Like, can I do that? Can I like stream it? Because I just need a sentence.

724
01:40:06,659 --> 01:40:33,239
You'll be sent to prison. Let's see here. What's going on? What is going on? You're right.

725
01:40:33,239 --> 01:40:39,220
I don't, I don't see anybody, I don't see anybody doing this streaming the direct.

726
01:40:39,220 --> 01:40:47,289
I don't, I'm not sure if I can. I don't know. Oh, okay, wait, somebody is, yeah, okay, hold on.

727
01:40:47,289 --> 01:41:00,569
Where the hell is it? All right, I just need to like, hear what they say. Like,

728
01:41:00,569 --> 01:41:21,819
I just need one sentence. Where is it? Okay, Nintendo Direct. Super Mario Maker 2 Direct.

729
01:41:21,819 --> 01:41:26,869
Okay, here it is. We just need whatever the, whatever the first thing we hear is. Okay?

730
01:41:27,510 --> 01:41:53,640
Ready? Tap this icon here and day becomes night. Done. You don't even need to watch that direct.

731
01:41:53,640 --> 01:42:06,920
You don't have to leave. Tap this icon here and day becomes night. You are now part of a magical

732
01:42:06,920 --> 01:42:12,279
world, the realm of our dreams. So I guess there are a few things wrong with what that

733
01:42:12,279 --> 01:42:17,579
last line says, and I guess I could be thinking of some sort of magic that I can talk

734
01:42:17,579 --> 01:42:21,579
and feel in place and be within. Or maybe that doesn't happen at all.

735
01:42:22,140 --> 01:42:26,619
And when we are able to truly come and be here with you and speak with you,

736
01:42:26,619 --> 01:42:31,960
it will be a more wonderful experience. Well, thanks for listening. And as usual,

737
01:42:31,960 --> 01:42:35,720
I hope you have a lot of fun during this week's lesson. If you have any questions

738
01:42:35,720 --> 01:42:40,760
for me or the host, I'm always available on Tumblr for questions regarding this blog as well.

739
01:42:40,760 --> 01:42:45,479
I'm also free with a couple of free weeks of writing in exchange for reviews,

740
01:42:45,479 --> 01:42:49,560
links and posts. Check out some of the links that I've written in the past for a taste.

741
01:42:50,199 --> 01:42:53,560
If you want to be notified when I publish more posts that might be of interest to you,

742
01:42:53,560 --> 01:42:57,000
you can sign up below. I'd like to hear your thoughts on this blog.

743
01:42:57,000 --> 01:43:05,319
Why is everybody Tumblr? If you hit the angry sun,

744
01:43:05,319 --> 01:43:33,670
Mario will lose a life. Okay, let's see what happens.

745
01:43:40,939 --> 01:43:47,220
If you hit the angry sun, Mario will lose a life. A lot of Mario is fun and I think he

746
01:43:47,220 --> 01:43:51,460
has always been. I like it. But the characters in Mario games tend to have a very special

747
01:43:51,460 --> 01:43:56,409
way of making me cry. My favorite game to play while crying is Sonic Lost World.

748
01:43:57,880 --> 01:44:01,560
I don't play video games but there has always been something I like to do when I'm crying.

749
01:44:03,020 --> 01:44:07,260
I usually do this before watching something sad. I just play the games and it takes

750
01:44:07,260 --> 01:44:11,670
me back to the real thing. I'm a bit of a sadist when it comes to my games.

751
01:44:12,229 --> 01:44:15,829
I usually like to listen and think about my mistakes and why I made them.

752
01:44:16,550 --> 01:44:21,430
When you're playing Mario, when you're sad, there will likely be something to think about

753
01:44:21,430 --> 01:44:26,789
but when playing something sad, when you're sad, you can take in that experience in a

754
01:44:26,789 --> 01:44:32,550
different way. I always love Mario's music. So my first suggestion would be to listen to

755
01:44:32,550 --> 01:44:49,210
the game while crying. It can really bring you to the edge of your seat and

756
01:44:51,029 --> 01:44:56,869
I wasn't prepared for that one. I wasn't prepared for it.

757
01:44:58,619 --> 01:45:02,060
What else we got? One more and then I'm going to stop doing video games. This is

758
01:45:02,060 --> 01:45:39,529
too much fun. This one sucks. I don't need the music but if you hit the moon you wipe out a

759
01:45:39,529 --> 01:45:44,170
screen full of enemies. Just keep your focus on that screen. Also know that the game has not

760
01:45:44,170 --> 01:45:47,930
been released on Xbox One or PC. You can check out the demo here. You can also download

761
01:45:47,930 --> 01:46:42,840
the game on PC here. At night, expect a surprise or two depending on the theme and how things are

762
01:46:42,840 --> 01:46:47,619
presented. It should be about an hour long but there might be a couple of extras like some new

763
01:46:47,619 --> 01:46:53,380
faces. There's also some nice lighting and a nice view so it is more of a short story with

764
01:46:53,380 --> 01:46:57,779
more action than a true movie but it's good fun and there are plenty of other people to

765
01:46:57,859 --> 01:47:04,340
play with if you want to. The story starts in 1774 in an English town called Freetown

766
01:47:04,340 --> 01:47:09,300
and runs through the years from the Civil War to when the country decided to leave the Union.

767
01:47:10,680 --> 01:47:16,539
The American colonies were devastated by war. The colonists in Liberia had to learn

768
01:47:16,539 --> 01:47:22,220
to survive with a strong central government in order to make a living and find shelter.

769
01:47:22,939 --> 01:47:25,739
This is where Mr. Smithfield comes up with the idea of helping out.

770
01:47:26,460 --> 01:47:30,699
After all, if the government were to give up on Liberia, where it is going to go,

771
01:47:30,699 --> 01:47:34,140
you have to start from scratch to survive. Mr. Smithfield's mission is to help rebuild

772
01:47:34,140 --> 01:47:37,180
this new United States and help those that come to him.

773
01:48:51,720 --> 01:48:59,340
If you get a dog and a lizard, you'll get the dog, which means you need both these pieces to be

774
01:48:59,340 --> 01:49:07,909
in order to form a proper functioning lizard. So it was a long while before I could see the

775
01:49:07,909 --> 01:49:16,779
world beyond those two small legs. Until the last bit of my life changed, my legs began to

776
01:49:16,779 --> 01:49:22,979
grow. I developed legs as an adult which gave me a chance to travel and meet so many others

777
01:49:23,939 --> 01:49:31,060
My children's legs also gave me this chance to experience life with other people. They gave

778
01:49:31,060 --> 01:49:37,100
me the chance to live life with other people and explore different cultures. Now my children

779
01:49:37,100 --> 01:49:44,260
are the only ones who need those legs to live. I am so blessed that I've had such an amazing

780
01:49:44,260 --> 01:49:49,909
journey and the people in my life have become so much nicer. Life with my kids and my new

781
01:49:49,909 --> 01:49:56,500
legs were just amazing to me. They're beautiful faces. They've even gone to places I'm a long

782
01:49:56,579 --> 01:50:07,850
way away from in different directions. It's so cool because my kids and I have to go. We have to go.

783
01:50:45,239 --> 01:50:51,020
Okay, I don't know. This one's not even sad, it's just fucking weird.

784
01:50:51,739 --> 01:51:40,619
No, no Mario music. In the ground theme, goombas will float. If you combine a rat and a donkey

785
01:51:40,619 --> 01:51:46,779
in the ground theme goombas will float over them until they die. They look like two tiny

786
01:51:46,779 --> 01:51:56,010
goombas playing chicken. Mike Wachowski, Donkey Kong Country CFO. For those of you that prefer

787
01:51:56,010 --> 01:52:01,369
video games over music, Donkey Kong Country 3 is also a solid game and it's worth mentioning

788
01:52:01,369 --> 01:52:05,689
that some of the characters don't even appear. You don't hear them when you kill the giant

789
01:52:05,689 --> 01:52:09,130
goombas or the goombas come out of the ground after beating the game and you don't

790
01:52:09,130 --> 01:52:13,529
hear them while the player does anything with the super mushroom after defeating the crazy

791
01:52:13,529 --> 01:52:18,539
Goron. A few of the characters also appear in a small area on the game's loading screen

792
01:52:19,420 --> 01:52:26,119
on Kong Skull Island. The game starts with Kong having to defeat his way through what appears

793
01:52:26,119 --> 01:52:31,239
to be many flying enemies. The only enemy he's encountered in his exploration of the island

794
01:52:32,039 --> 01:52:37,159
he can easily beat without using any other weapons or items. When he finds King Slump's

795
01:52:37,159 --> 01:53:06,359
nest to start his journey he's... somebody said to try this one. Use the last sentence

796
01:53:06,359 --> 01:53:40,979
of this to make a new one. Okay, use the last sentence. Here we go. Let me tell you a sad

797
01:53:40,979 --> 01:53:50,180
story. There was once a young boy who was not well liked. The older his friends became the

798
01:53:50,180 --> 01:53:56,869
more bitter his hatred escalated. Every day they were beaten up so badly he lost half of

799
01:53:56,869 --> 01:54:02,970
his face. His eyes were swollen shut and he was covered in bandages. To see how he really

800
01:54:02,970 --> 01:54:07,420
felt was beyond words and every time it seemed they could just keep going the punishment

801
01:54:07,420 --> 01:54:13,909
would get worse. One day a woman stopped in to buy some bread. He didn't listen to her.

802
01:54:13,909 --> 01:54:20,439
He didn't seem to care. Then one day he walked right into her bedroom. She screamed

803
01:54:20,439 --> 01:54:24,899
and ran out screaming. The next morning she said to her parents, I don't know what I did

804
01:54:24,899 --> 01:54:32,810
to him. You're useless. He just stood there and didn't even move. All the while the old

805
01:54:32,810 --> 01:54:38,460
man tried to comfort him. Then one day there was some sort of accident. A boy was playing

806
01:54:38,460 --> 01:54:43,859
with his friends and the big wooden hammer fell on one of his friends and knocked him

807
01:54:43,859 --> 01:54:49,979
down as well. At the hospital the nurse looked on but still as she said not that bad and then

808
01:54:49,979 --> 01:55:02,220
something. Isn't this a goomba story? The big wooden hammer. That's Mario with the goombas.

809
01:55:05,270 --> 01:55:20,250
Princess Peach like they're just walking around like screaming. Let's try another one.

810
01:55:20,250 --> 01:55:37,159
It's not that bad. All right okay let me tell you a sad story. Uh okay I don't we

811
01:55:37,159 --> 01:55:45,369
might have to abort this one halfway through. Let me tell you a sad story. Two friends.

812
01:55:45,369 --> 01:55:52,100
My best friend and myself. We were young and cute and cute little girls. We loved games. We loved

813
01:55:52,100 --> 01:55:59,619
music. We loved movies and books. We made fun of each other. And our mom liked games. We liked

814
01:55:59,619 --> 01:56:05,779
music. We loved Disney movies. We loved sports. And we all enjoyed playing games. We went to a

815
01:56:05,779 --> 01:56:10,819
game every weekend. It was always about the games. We would sit alone and play each other's

816
01:56:10,819 --> 01:56:17,029
computer games. And our mom would always ask what was that cool thing that we played. We would say

817
01:56:17,029 --> 01:56:24,229
that it was fun. And then when she wanted to play something that would involve kids she took

818
01:56:24,229 --> 01:56:31,109
off. And that's when it gets weird. So then that's what happened. Because while my friends

819
01:56:31,109 --> 01:56:35,829
and I had a blast playing our first electronic games. I didn't have a great time. Something

820
01:56:35,829 --> 01:56:52,140
is wrong here. But you won't find... It was always about the games.

821
01:57:01,300 --> 01:57:20,649
Whatever. What the fuck? I've no... This one's all over the place. I don't even...

822
01:57:21,829 --> 01:57:25,939
Just... Let me tell you a sad story. For weeks I had been thinking the worst about my

823
01:57:25,939 --> 01:57:29,619
daughter and I was so ashamed about that. I would not take her out of bed every night

824
01:57:29,619 --> 01:57:33,140
because I really loved her. I don't mean to be a cruel mother or take all the credit for

825
01:57:33,140 --> 01:57:37,060
anything that happened. But my wife is so nice to me that I was just looking at you and

826
01:57:37,060 --> 01:57:41,779
I couldn't put my face up so she wouldn't notice that I was crying. That's when I knew something...

827
01:57:41,779 --> 01:57:45,539
I knew I had to do something. My wife came home from work and gave me a list of the friends

828
01:57:45,539 --> 01:57:49,380
we would be spending the night with. I don't know if I was the smartest person ever to

829
01:57:49,380 --> 01:57:53,699
think about any of this. But after talking with several people, two men and a woman,

830
01:57:53,699 --> 01:57:57,779
I remember one of them telling me, she's going to be so lonely tonight. I put together

831
01:57:57,779 --> 01:58:03,619
about $500 out of my own pocket and started planning. I asked about my wife's and told my

832
01:58:03,619 --> 01:58:07,939
daughter to stay home. While I sent the money home with friends, she wanted to have dinner with

833
01:58:07,939 --> 01:58:51,079
that night with her. I have no idea. The world is a beautiful place. What is this?

834
01:58:53,560 --> 01:58:58,359
The world is a beautiful place. Beautiful all the time. I'm just happy you can see the

835
01:58:58,359 --> 01:59:04,550
trees in the sunset. I wish I knew your name. I don't know how to get it, but I wish I knew

836
01:59:05,670 --> 01:59:14,170
Molly to Charlie's girlfriend. Due to her life stolen from her, Molly may be very naive,

837
01:59:14,170 --> 01:59:19,779
naive and naivety. That was shown quite clearly when she told Charlie's girlfriend, Nicole,

838
01:59:20,500 --> 01:59:28,039
that she wanted a ride for her birthday. When Nicole found out that Molly was missing and

839
01:59:28,039 --> 01:59:32,760
wanted to speak with Charlie's girlfriend, Charlie's girlfriend, Molly, immediately blamed

840
01:59:32,760 --> 01:59:37,340
herself and immediately took Nicole to the school. Charlie's girlfriend could just see that

841
01:59:37,340 --> 01:59:41,739
the girl was scared and started to get angry. This is how Molly began to distrust strangers,

842
01:59:41,739 --> 01:59:45,500
such as Nicole, Charlie or the police, and often began telling Charlie to go away and not

843
01:59:45,500 --> 01:59:49,909
come back. When Molly was trying to get rid of Charlie's girlfriend, she did a similar trick

844
01:59:49,909 --> 01:59:53,670
to Charlie as she also tried to get rid of Nicole. When the situation became complicated,

845
01:59:53,670 --> 02:00:31,619
she realized Charlie... What the fuck? The world is a beautiful place. I fixed it. I

846
02:00:31,619 --> 02:01:05,619
fixed it. Pretty relaxed. It's just meaningless. I don't think I can ride the Superman

847
02:01:05,619 --> 02:01:10,439
roller coaster. It looks too tall and scary on the front. One man wrote,

848
02:01:10,439 --> 02:01:17,000
I just want to ride it to visit. A Facebook friend who identified himself as David said

849
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:21,420
it wouldn't make a difference for him. He only rode the roller coaster at night.

850
02:01:21,420 --> 02:01:27,180
I like to ride. I just prefer to ride at night. His post read, I would rather ride

851
02:01:27,180 --> 02:01:34,020
on our local amusement park. I have a seven to 15 year old son, so I want him to never

852
02:01:34,020 --> 02:01:39,479
be bored or not be distracted by the fact that my son rides one day. Do you know how

853
02:01:39,479 --> 02:01:48,090
old your son is? He's between seven and 15. I have no idea. I missed a few birthdays.

854
02:01:48,649 --> 02:02:01,340
That's a gigantic gap. It's somewhere between seven and 15. You know. He's a kid.

855
02:02:36,250 --> 02:02:42,810
Okay, here we go. Ready?

856
02:02:51,319 --> 02:02:56,630
Six Flags is the best amusement park. It's a great place to get your fix while you spend

857
02:02:56,630 --> 02:03:00,630
the day and you can count on them to offer you the ultimate family experience.

858
02:03:01,590 --> 02:03:06,090
We had been visiting their theme park for the last five years. We've enjoyed our time there

859
02:03:06,170 --> 02:03:10,329
so much, we decided to move on to another location for our visit and the first thing

860
02:03:10,329 --> 02:03:17,529
we found was the parking. We were confused, so we went back to the park with our four-wheelers

861
02:03:17,529 --> 02:03:21,609
and went through three additional cars before walking right past another large park.

862
02:03:22,569 --> 02:03:28,010
That was it. We drove past the same cars and then stopped a second time with no one there

863
02:03:28,010 --> 02:03:34,409
or our SUV, but this time we didn't even bother leaving the lot for it to be in sight.

864
02:03:34,489 --> 02:03:46,090
It was just another car park. It was just another car. It was just another car park with one other

865
02:03:46,090 --> 02:03:52,170
vehicle or even a single vehicle on the lot. The four-vehicle limit. They made me look like

866
02:03:52,170 --> 02:03:58,729
a fool and I had to take it out when I did finally manage to move one of the two spaces

867
02:03:58,729 --> 02:04:06,550
I decided to stay. They have a long story that includes a lot of comments from customers.

868
02:04:06,550 --> 02:04:17,300
We were on the road. Oh god damn it. I wish I could fucking compose myself on some of these,

869
02:04:17,300 --> 02:04:22,439
but when you drive it around in circles, they have a shitload of parking lots

870
02:04:22,439 --> 02:04:26,039
when you paid to get in and then you drive it around for parking and there's a four-vehicle

871
02:04:26,039 --> 02:04:32,359
limit and you're taking three cars and four four-wheelers? How many four-wheelers? How

872
02:04:32,359 --> 02:04:37,829
many cars do you have? You're just driving around looking for a parking spot.

873
02:04:38,729 --> 02:04:50,119
Uh, Fmeric, thanks for the 10 community subs. Thank you. That's 10 big subs. Really appreciate that.

874
02:04:54,649 --> 02:04:59,779
Oh god damn it. All right, let's try it. I like these, but thank you for the 10 subs.

875
02:05:22,500 --> 02:05:27,300
Six Flags is the best amusement park. They're located in Orlando, Florida,

876
02:05:27,300 --> 02:05:31,939
which is in the middle of Florida. The Orlando attractions are outstanding and are worth

877
02:05:32,020 --> 02:05:36,180
checking out. I had the opportunity to visit the following parks during a promotional tour.

878
02:05:37,060 --> 02:05:41,380
Inn of Dreams is one of the top attractions that's currently under construction.

879
02:05:41,380 --> 02:05:44,899
They did not say if the opening will take place soon or not, but I was told that

880
02:05:44,899 --> 02:05:49,939
the attractions would be ready at the end of summer 2017. I will give Inn of Dreams a 9

881
02:05:49,939 --> 02:05:59,750
out of 10 for their experience. You can check out some photos below. It didn't even go.

882
02:06:00,710 --> 02:06:06,659
What are your favorite amusement park attractions? Let me know in the comment section.

883
02:06:06,659 --> 02:06:11,220
Do you enjoy visiting the parks in and out of Orlando? Do you have any experiences to share

884
02:06:11,220 --> 02:06:28,630
with us? Share with us. Like this video if you can. I'll do Disney World. One more Six Flags.

885
02:06:46,500 --> 02:06:49,539
I'm gonna try. I'm gonna try really hard.

886
02:06:53,609 --> 02:06:58,010
This is fucking hilarious. Oh, this is huge. Bitch just came in. I'm gonna try as hard as

887
02:06:58,010 --> 02:07:01,210
I can. This is like the best one of the night. This is the best one of the whole day.

888
02:07:02,939 --> 02:07:16,569
Okay. Thank you so much to Lexi. Lexi Z for the hundred fucking bucks. 10,000 bits. They say,

889
02:07:16,569 --> 02:07:19,770
I can't remember the last time I laughed this much. I'm crying of laughter and gasping for

890
02:07:19,770 --> 02:07:24,739
air. Thank you so much for making my day. Sincerely, an EU pleb. That's a fucking ton

891
02:07:24,739 --> 02:07:27,939
of money, Lexi. Thank you. I'm glad you're having a good time. This is fucking, this is

892
02:07:27,939 --> 02:07:38,069
a blast. Gasping for air, but yeah. Hundred bucks. And I'm gonna compose myself as hard

893
02:07:38,069 --> 02:07:41,109
as I fucking can because this one has to be done completely without cracking.

894
02:07:48,199 --> 02:07:56,890
Stupid. I have to get it out of my system. I gotta like fucking shake my body.

895
02:08:08,649 --> 02:08:14,710
Six Flags is the best amusement park. It's a park of, it's a park for fun and I think it's

896
02:08:14,710 --> 02:08:19,510
pretty amazing. When we visited, our park had a really nice view from the park. You can see

897
02:08:19,510 --> 02:08:27,510
the entire park at your own pace for $5. This is a fun, cheap ride. For $8 you'll get a ride or two

898
02:08:27,510 --> 02:08:31,750
that takes you through the whole park, including a little fun boat ride down the park's pirate

899
02:08:31,750 --> 02:08:36,949
ship. So you get your ride, some food, and then you go back down in the boat and ride

900
02:08:36,949 --> 02:08:43,750
through the fun ride. The ride includes the ride itself with the boat, fun ride, a few

901
02:08:43,750 --> 02:08:47,989
drinks, and some souvenirs. It's a great place to hang out with your friends and a great

902
02:08:47,989 --> 02:08:53,829
place to visit during the day. All in all, this place is well worth the $7. They have tons of

903
02:08:53,829 --> 02:08:58,710
rides. I've been looking forward to some of my friends coming there, including the Great Wall

904
02:08:58,710 --> 02:09:07,029
of China, the Three Kings, King Kong, the World's Biggest Monkey Fries, all the giant bats.

905
02:09:26,300 --> 02:09:34,140
The Great Wall of China is in Six Flags. It's $5 by the way, $8. What a fucking value for

906
02:09:34,140 --> 02:09:50,170
$7 to go see the Great Wall of China. The Three Kings, the World's Biggest Monkey Rides.

907
02:09:52,409 --> 02:09:59,699
This is fucking, I want to like eat this one. It's just this sentence here.

908
02:10:02,060 --> 02:10:11,960
This is like, the ride includes the ride itself with the boat, fun ride. It's just like,

909
02:10:12,920 --> 02:10:22,260
oh my god, more fucking huge amount of money. Thank you for the hundred fucking bucks,

910
02:10:22,260 --> 02:10:36,760
mother of, 10,000 bits. Well, I know where I'm heading this summer, to Six Chinas.

911
02:10:40,039 --> 02:10:44,680
Imagine if somebody was talking about like this place, Six Flags, and yeah, yeah, this is

912
02:10:44,680 --> 02:10:49,079
cool. They have a fun boat ride. You can have a few drinks. It's cool. You can hang out

913
02:10:49,079 --> 02:10:56,649
with your friends. You can also visit the Great Wall of China and the Three Kings. This

914
02:10:56,649 --> 02:11:01,130
is like a historical landmark. This is not an amusement park. What do you, what,

915
02:11:01,130 --> 02:11:09,640
why is Six Flags right here? And it's only seven bucks and you get all the giant bats.

916
02:11:10,760 --> 02:11:23,100
Yeah, the World's Biggest Monkey Ride. What does that even fucking mean?

917
02:11:27,939 --> 02:11:35,779
Like look, is this included? Is King Kong included in the World's Biggest Monkey Rides?

918
02:11:35,779 --> 02:11:47,689
This is the World's Biggest Monkey Ride. Oh, I feel like I have to do one more.

919
02:12:06,810 --> 02:12:08,890
This is, give me a fucking break.

920
02:12:14,779 --> 02:12:21,739
Okay, you ready? Okay, this, last Six Flags, last one from Six Flags.

921
02:12:26,420 --> 02:12:32,039
Six Flags is an amazing amusement park. We've always said that. It's one of the

922
02:12:32,039 --> 02:12:37,239
nicest locations around as well. The ride is fun and the staff are all fantastic.

923
02:12:38,199 --> 02:12:43,460
I always liked the rides because of their unique nature. Our friend got the two-day

924
02:12:43,460 --> 02:12:49,380
pass which included the 5,000 and 8,000. While my friend loved it, the other two fell in love

925
02:12:49,380 --> 02:12:56,119
with it. The 5,000 has a great layout, a great sound, a great view of the park

926
02:12:56,119 --> 02:13:01,159
with parking behind you. There's a lot of people walking around. We had the 1.25-mile

927
02:13:01,159 --> 02:13:08,119
loop track of it. The 8,000 is about five blocks long that goes around every park

928
02:13:08,119 --> 02:13:14,199
and there's benches on the end for people to sit and talk. We really enjoyed both and the

929
02:13:14,199 --> 02:13:18,520
only issue that came up was that they had to change the speed of the loop as that was

930
02:13:18,520 --> 02:13:23,720
confusing for children. They would go faster after the loop as they're getting the feel of

931
02:13:23,720 --> 02:13:27,640
it and then slower when they're taking it back. It was frustrating that they had to change

932
02:13:27,640 --> 02:13:38,359
the pace after just three minutes. While they are great, from my understanding,

933
02:13:39,000 --> 02:13:52,420
this was $5,000 to walk around in the circle. And the $8,000 one is smaller.

934
02:13:52,420 --> 02:14:02,380
Wait, it's a marathon. An 8K? We had the 1.25-mile. Wait, wait, hold on. Wait, it's a five

935
02:14:02,380 --> 02:14:26,340
kilometer run? They said miles. You just go to Six Flags to do a 5K? I thought it was

936
02:14:26,340 --> 02:14:35,479
talking about it was five grand or eight grand packages. One more. I have to. I'm sorry.

937
02:14:48,739 --> 02:14:54,539
No, we got a bad one. This one just sucks. Six Flags is the best amusement park. It's a

938
02:14:54,539 --> 02:14:59,739
unique nature in history. Make it more than just a place to go to sleep. This one sucks.

939
02:15:12,439 --> 02:15:34,300
Okay, this is the last one. Okay, final one from Six Flags.

940
02:15:39,930 --> 02:15:45,369
Six Flags is the best amusement park. I love the roller coasters. Roller coasters,

941
02:15:45,369 --> 02:15:49,609
amusement parks, roller coasters. It's always crazy and has such great music.

942
02:15:50,170 --> 02:15:54,090
I was going to try Haunted Mansion at least once, but then after watching the video,

943
02:15:54,090 --> 02:15:59,130
it looked really good on TV. I did get one roller skater, but I was too afraid to ride

944
02:15:59,130 --> 02:16:03,529
because of how weird it looked. I was going to try roller coasters the next day after watching

945
02:16:03,529 --> 02:16:08,409
the video, but then I realized that I still have a lot of stuff to do while I wait,

946
02:16:08,409 --> 02:16:12,170
which is not fun. I guess I'll stick with the attractions for now, but I'll definitely

947
02:16:12,170 --> 02:16:16,729
come back next year. I love watching this video. There were so many things to consider

948
02:16:16,729 --> 02:16:20,569
and it was really interesting. I'll try to read the directions on the website and make

949
02:16:20,569 --> 02:16:40,760
sure I get my roller coaster properly constructed. You could really make many

950
02:16:40,760 --> 02:16:45,239
choices if you follow it very precisely. It just wasn't there for me and it was too weird.

951
02:16:46,200 --> 02:16:54,420
I love this one. I'm a big fan of roller coasters. Roller.

952
02:16:57,979 --> 02:17:03,659
He's going to build his own like Mount Doom in his backyard. You're going to build your

953
02:17:03,659 --> 02:17:09,290
own like Superman ride of steel. I did not read that. I did not see that part. That

954
02:17:09,290 --> 02:17:48,170
threw me off. Wait, wait, wait. Oh my god. My fucking, my throat hurts.

955
02:17:50,920 --> 02:18:10,979
How long? Holy shit. It's been two hours and 20 minutes. Oh god. All right, so we need to...

956
02:18:13,370 --> 02:18:17,459
No, no, no. It can't be that again. Well, like, I don't know. What's the...

957
02:18:23,000 --> 02:18:33,500
If I play Disney music, I'm going to jail. How about this one?

958
02:18:33,899 --> 02:18:57,559
Ahem. Disney World sucks to see us. More news... Disney World sucks to see us.

959
02:18:58,809 --> 02:19:04,170
Battleship has been shut down until further notice. More news and updates though. The

960
02:19:04,170 --> 02:19:07,209
Hollywood Reporter has issued the following statement after the Disney parks and resorts

961
02:19:07,209 --> 02:19:12,090
announcement. This morning Marvel announced that Guardians of the Galaxy 4 will be returning

962
02:19:12,090 --> 02:19:17,209
to theaters on March 5th, 2017. As it is a brand new franchise, the announcement of a movie

963
02:19:17,209 --> 02:19:21,690
is always the biggest event of a company's lifespan. At this late stage of the game,

964
02:19:21,690 --> 02:19:25,770
nothing is announced even with an official announcement the following week. However,

965
02:19:25,770 --> 02:19:29,530
after reading the statement Disney released after we were able to go backstage with the cast

966
02:19:29,530 --> 02:19:34,090
at the opening night premiere party in Burbank and see the trailer from last weekend's movie,

967
02:19:34,090 --> 02:19:38,170
I think we can all agree with them it'll happen. Marvel and Marvel Studios have

968
02:19:38,170 --> 02:19:41,610
invested a hell of a lot of talent into this universe and I applaud them for pulling it

969
02:19:41,610 --> 02:19:45,610
together to do so. To all their fans out there, Marvel has been wonderful to visit

970
02:19:46,250 --> 02:19:50,010
and we will see you again in a few weeks for yet another exciting release in another chapter of

971
02:19:50,010 --> 02:20:32,940
Marvel Studios Phase One Avengers. They're going backwards. Phase One Avengers. Uh,

972
02:20:32,940 --> 02:20:53,100
this one seems all over the place. I, okay, let's try it. Uh, okay. I fell asleep during

973
02:20:53,100 --> 02:21:01,590
the presentation and my son did not wake up until four hours later while some people

974
02:21:01,590 --> 02:21:05,030
complained to me that they were sleep deprived while they were watching it.

975
02:21:05,030 --> 02:21:13,190
It was not until after 4 a.m. or 6 a.m. that I woke up. My son stayed up later than me

976
02:21:13,190 --> 02:21:17,750
and I've always known that I slept for five or six hours before an appointment.

977
02:21:19,000 --> 02:21:23,639
I remember not being sleepy in the morning or even when I went to work.

978
02:21:24,280 --> 02:21:34,729
It was the night before my first birthday. My parents are both doctors. My mother-in-law is

979
02:21:34,729 --> 02:21:40,409
in obstetrics and gynecology and while the two jobs are completely different positions,

980
02:21:40,409 --> 02:21:44,409
it is clear that our family's backgrounds have little to do with each other or our work

981
02:21:44,409 --> 02:21:50,899
schedules. The main difference between attending an obstetrician or gynecologist and an

982
02:21:50,899 --> 02:21:56,500
anesthesiologist is that a doctor is trained from an early age to handle medical emergencies,

983
02:21:56,500 --> 02:22:02,309
to be able to offer better care and to give faster feedback. Both a medical doctor and

984
02:22:02,309 --> 02:22:07,270
an anesthesiologist are trained in anesthesiology, which is the application of current medical

985
02:22:07,270 --> 02:22:20,780
techniques to... Wait, am I under anesthesia? Wait, am I... Is it... Was I just on...

986
02:22:21,979 --> 02:22:40,229
I was under anesthesia. All right, I'll do a... Okay, I'll do a wrestling intro after this

987
02:22:40,229 --> 02:23:08,680
one. We've been playing for too long. I need to capture again. Yeah. All right, let's...

988
02:23:21,270 --> 02:23:28,100
I'm just gonna put this up and on. Random music in the background.

989
02:23:28,739 --> 02:23:39,350
I have trouble sleeping, I said. What's the matter? And then when I lay down, it won't go on,

990
02:23:39,350 --> 02:23:43,659
to which I told her not to worry, for she will be able to get me up again in six minutes.

991
02:23:44,520 --> 02:23:50,489
She looked at me with disgust. She then looked at me with disgust. Then she pulled me up by

992
02:23:50,489 --> 02:23:55,420
the shoulders again till I gave up all hope and asked all my questions that she might

993
02:23:55,420 --> 02:24:04,069
be able to help me. The time was three in the evening. When I saw myself on the floor,

994
02:24:04,069 --> 02:24:11,190
I was in pain. It had blood running down my face. After some time, I woke up and I saw the man

995
02:24:11,190 --> 02:24:17,770
sitting there who could not reach me. Hello, Mr. Jackson. How's the end? And I answered him

996
02:24:17,770 --> 02:24:23,850
without a word, as if it was very simple, since I knew it could only be solved by a miracle.

997
02:24:24,809 --> 02:24:31,979
No, he said. It's nothing. My wife's dead. He looked for surprise at me as well as I did at

998
02:24:31,979 --> 02:25:39,739
him. He was trembling like a leaf that's just broken. Okay. In this corner, weighing in at 260

999
02:25:39,739 --> 02:25:47,979
pounds from Burbank, California, the cruiser crusher, as he says in the video,

1000
02:25:47,979 --> 02:25:52,280
when you think about the size of that thing, it's a miracle that I can make it out.

1001
02:25:52,280 --> 02:25:57,239
It looks like it's in trouble. So I'm not too worried about it. I'm really excited for

1002
02:25:57,239 --> 02:26:03,500
to get started on my next ride, the last ride of your life, the end of your road.

1003
02:26:03,500 --> 02:27:11,690
It's yours. Check out this video for more photos. Here we go. It cleans out pores and heals blemishes.

1004
02:27:11,690 --> 02:27:16,819
Use it to hydrate the skin with the benefits of coconut oil. It leaves an impossibly beautiful,

1005
02:27:16,819 --> 02:27:23,260
almost organic look. The oil transforms your skin and creates a truly luxurious effect. The

1006
02:27:23,260 --> 02:27:29,180
coconut oil provides hydration, hydrating, and nourishing ingredients like coconut flax seed oil

1007
02:27:29,180 --> 02:28:13,780
and aloe vera gel, and the oil helps to replenish damaged seboscis glands. No,

1008
02:28:15,940 --> 02:28:24,139
go forward. Optimus Prime, because I type, this is the last page I was at. I typed in,

1009
02:28:24,139 --> 02:28:28,459
talk to transformer. Optimus Prime, Bumblebee, Mega, I gotta take that one.

1010
02:28:28,459 --> 02:28:31,579
Optimus Prime, Bumblebee, Megatron, Transform, and talk to Transform.

1011
02:28:32,780 --> 02:29:02,229
Fuck, what was it? Bumblebee. Why am I playing YouTuber music? Because I was going

1012
02:29:02,229 --> 02:29:21,959
to do like a YouTuber ad for like makeup. All right, here we go. This is a theme song

1013
02:29:21,959 --> 02:29:30,389
to Transformers. Oh, it's the old Transformers. I want like the new one. All right, this is fine.

1014
02:29:34,340 --> 02:29:42,520
Optimus Prime, Megatron, and Bumblebee. The Autobots are later encountered again in a fight

1015
02:29:42,520 --> 02:29:47,639
against them, which ends with the latter being defeated. Prime's body is then dropped into the

1016
02:29:47,639 --> 02:29:54,069
sea by Starscream. A few years later, Galvatron was fighting his fellow primates.

1017
02:29:54,709 --> 02:29:58,709
After suffering from a debilitating brain disorder, he had to take a rest

1018
02:29:59,979 --> 02:30:07,139
and was then replaced by a new body. Later, Megatron took the new body on his ship

1019
02:30:07,139 --> 02:30:14,219
for his own purposes of testing its abilities. To no avail. Later, Galvatron used its powerful

1020
02:30:14,219 --> 02:30:19,799
powers to destroy the Autobots on Cybertron. Galvatron would later come up with a plan to

1021
02:30:19,799 --> 02:30:26,069
use these powers on Cybertron himself. He used some of the new body's power to create

1022
02:30:26,069 --> 02:30:34,500
a gigantic giant Energon beast. The beast was so massive it actually affected the size of Cybertron.

1023
02:30:35,059 --> 02:30:40,340
The beast used these powers on the Autobots, allowing them to eventually destroy that monstrous

1024
02:30:40,340 --> 02:30:48,100
being. In another scenario, Starscream used Megatron to create Energon beasts to be used

1025
02:30:48,100 --> 02:31:30,620
to power a massive weapon which would destroy the moon, despite- I hate to leave a review this

1026
02:31:30,620 --> 02:31:39,459
bad- but it's all because I wasn't in a good mood last week. So how do we feel about the

1027
02:31:39,459 --> 02:31:46,120
current state of both our homes? Our pets? Our marriage? How do we feel about the fact that

1028
02:31:46,120 --> 02:31:50,860
I will be giving a free presentation at a local pet convention this year, but I have to cancel.

1029
02:31:50,860 --> 02:31:56,090
I would like to have the opportunity to talk to the people at the conference about pet

1030
02:31:56,090 --> 02:32:00,809
therapy. I would like to be invited. I'd like to talk to other pet therapy professionals,

1031
02:32:00,809 --> 02:32:05,430
but I've already missed that last time. We've already missed the holidays with our families,

1032
02:32:06,389 --> 02:32:13,399
and there's nothing to do. You can't even attend the Pet Expo. I'm not even allowed into any of

1033
02:32:13,399 --> 02:32:18,329
the pet shows because I've missed all the parties. It's really difficult for me to be able to

1034
02:32:18,329 --> 02:32:24,340
attend these events and not feel like my life is in jeopardy. What? There are a lot of

1035
02:32:24,340 --> 02:32:33,940
myths out there about animal behavior. I just want to stress out on this one. Myth. Dog owners

1036
02:32:33,940 --> 02:32:41,719
are too strict. Dog... What is at this convention? Are you... Is it a bunch of wild bears?

1037
02:32:42,440 --> 02:33:10,250
All right, let's use this. Myth. Dog owners are too strict. Dogs are... What the fuck? Okay.

1038
02:33:17,059 --> 02:33:24,170
This one doesn't even need music. Myth. Dog owners are too strict. Dogs are smart about

1039
02:33:24,170 --> 02:33:29,219
obedience routines, but many dog owners simply are not. As a result, many dogs are not only

1040
02:33:29,219 --> 02:33:35,059
misbehaving, but also causing problems for owners and other visitors alike. If you live in an

1041
02:33:35,059 --> 02:33:38,100
apartment complex, you are one of the most frequent visitors to your apartment building.

1042
02:33:38,659 --> 02:33:42,899
If, as a result, you discover that one-bedroom apartments you once occupied in an older

1043
02:33:42,899 --> 02:33:47,540
building no longer function smoothly, or other furniture has deteriorated severely,

1044
02:33:47,540 --> 02:33:51,940
or that your dog has been barking and barking and so forth, it's highly likely your dogs

1045
02:33:51,940 --> 02:33:57,750
will cause the trouble for other visitors as well. A 2012 study conducted by Dr. Richard

1046
02:33:57,750 --> 02:34:03,190
L. Poulin and his colleagues published in the September 2012 issue of Veterinary Practice

1047
02:34:03,750 --> 02:34:07,430
suggests that no matter how good a dog may be in obedience training programs,

1048
02:34:07,430 --> 02:34:11,430
it is difficult to train and test them adequately, because they are trained and

1049
02:34:11,430 --> 02:34:15,930
tested only on a limited number of dogs. Poulin and his team examine the relationships

1050
02:34:15,930 --> 02:34:20,629
between six types of dog behaviors identified in previous studies by the American Kennel Club,

1051
02:34:20,629 --> 02:34:53,799
and boring. This is just the rest of the paper. We just got the rest of the article.

1052
02:35:02,889 --> 02:35:47,559
Just gonna read a whole science article. This stream is making me resident sleeper of

1053
02:35:47,559 --> 02:35:54,360
laugh out loud. At go fund me lol, at go fund me lol, at go fund me lol, ay, ay, ay, ay,

1054
02:35:55,079 --> 02:36:00,840
ay, I hope so, and so can make this thread awesome. Hey yo, I hope so, and so can make

1055
02:36:00,840 --> 02:36:33,219
this thread awesome lol, ay, I hope so, and so make this thread awesome lol, epic donation.

1056
02:36:34,180 --> 02:36:46,680
Ay, cap is in the chat. I'm an optimist because I know it can wait, and I like that. I'm a pessimist

1057
02:36:46,680 --> 02:37:19,559
because I always wait until I know you'll see something I'm not expecting. Doom OST for this

1058
02:37:19,559 --> 02:37:52,729
one. That's it. Type Undertale. I'm not sure I want to do that. Dante's trip to Six Flags.

1059
02:38:10,260 --> 02:38:12,979
I've been to hell. What do I, in the last 10 years, number of American pills.

1060
02:38:15,590 --> 02:38:44,780
Okay, we're not, we're gonna do a different one. Back to Six Flags.

1061
02:38:44,780 --> 02:39:02,340
No, I'm just having trouble with this one. Here's my Yelp review. Play the song. I have to wait

1062
02:39:02,340 --> 02:39:43,139
till I get something. Uh, no, this is, you're gonna get Six Flags advertisements for the next

1063
02:39:43,139 --> 02:40:02,069
six months. And then I'm just gonna write total nonsense after this. Do a roses are red,

1064
02:40:02,069 --> 02:40:11,000
violets are blue. It doesn't have anything. This is the one that's gonna make the machine

1065
02:40:11,000 --> 02:40:26,010
not know what to do. Wow, that's surprising. Mine isn't working also. Uh oh. Did we,

1066
02:40:26,010 --> 02:40:46,250
did we kill the website? Uh oh, the website's broken. All right, everybody X out of the window.

1067
02:40:46,250 --> 02:40:54,059
Yeah, I think it's over. This is the, I don't remember when I said that. Is it my internet

1068
02:40:54,059 --> 02:41:10,540
that's fucking up? No. Well, I think, quick, everybody leave. Uh, I think we're gonna have

1069
02:41:10,540 --> 02:41:21,079
to move on to Jackbox. The website is currently down and we're, ah, what time is it? Ah,

1070
02:41:21,079 --> 02:41:26,139
I don't know if we can do Jackbox. We can probably play like, I don't want to just open

1071
02:41:26,139 --> 02:41:30,069
up and play one game. I guess we could. I didn't think we were gonna be doing this for three

1072
02:41:30,069 --> 02:41:35,530
hours. Um, I got about like, I have like another hour and a half or so, like one to two hours.

1073
02:41:42,440 --> 02:41:48,200
We could probably do a couple of Jackbox games. Yeah, we'll do that. Let me try

1074
02:41:48,200 --> 02:41:52,620
this one more time. This was the funniest shit ever though. I mean, this is, what a

1075
02:41:52,620 --> 02:42:05,030
funny website. Hour, well like an hour to play and then like 30 minutes to do the end

1076
02:42:05,030 --> 02:42:13,399
of the stream, kind of hang out and do bits and subs and stuff. Let me refresh the page.

1077
02:42:14,040 --> 02:42:45,100
Did it work? Yahtzee? No, no, no, no, no Yahtzee. We'll do a couple of Jackbox. Mario

1078
02:42:45,100 --> 02:42:50,819
Yahtzee is the new Geo guesser. The page is working, the AI is done. That's okay,

1079
02:42:50,819 --> 02:43:00,020
we'll just move on. I'm gonna do Jackbox Party Pack 3. That was really fun though.

1080
02:43:00,659 --> 02:43:15,829
You promised Yahtzee. I played Yahtzee last night. I just did it. Is your Discord invite

1081
02:43:15,829 --> 02:43:21,020
only? No. It is open to anyone. It is a public Discord. You can hang out. There's

1082
02:43:21,020 --> 02:43:25,180
plenty of channels there. There's a sub only of Rome, but you don't have, what do you mean

1083
02:43:25,180 --> 02:43:33,379
no you didn't? I beat Mario in a World Series last night. Jackbox, we're gonna do Jackbox

1084
02:43:33,379 --> 02:43:45,079
3 and we'll do it for about an hour. Let me change the title. Thanks for hanging out.

1085
02:43:45,079 --> 02:43:50,379
You just kind of drop by to see what this was. We'll do Jackbox for an hour and by the way,

1086
02:43:50,379 --> 02:43:56,120
I'll be back this weekend. So Saturday and Sunday we're gonna go, we're gonna do MS-DOS

1087
02:43:56,120 --> 02:44:00,299
Night probably on Saturday. I don't think that would make the most sense, Saturday night.

1088
02:44:01,270 --> 02:44:06,790
We'll do part two of MS-DOS Night and then Sunday we're gonna do Sam and Max episode one and two

1089
02:44:07,510 --> 02:44:12,389
and depending on how I'm feeling, we might just try to power through all three episodes

1090
02:44:12,389 --> 02:44:18,790
because it's not six, there's five. They might be willing to power through them. We'll see.
