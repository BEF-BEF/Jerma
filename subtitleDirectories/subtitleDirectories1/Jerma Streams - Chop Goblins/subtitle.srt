1
00:00:06,259 --> 00:00:18,089
That was really bad. Do it louder. No! All right, so what uh, what do we want to do?

2
00:00:18,089 --> 00:00:30,949
I got a few options here. Let's see. I could do... I could play Isaac. Oh, what about um...

3
00:00:32,869 --> 00:00:37,939
What about Chop Goblins? This has been on the list for a long time. This is, I think this is pretty

4
00:00:37,939 --> 00:00:51,750
short. Isn't this only like an hour or two? This is like less than an hour, isn't it? Yeah, let's do

5
00:00:51,750 --> 00:01:16,150
that. That sounds fun. Yeah, I'm gonna give it a try. Give me one sec. You should see it momentarily.

6
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:36,739
Keep the title. Keep the title. Yeah, I think, let me see. I love how this is a Chop Goblins

7
00:01:36,739 --> 00:01:53,159
game of the week edition. Cool. All right, now I'm gonna get it. Yeah, it's a little uh, it's an FPS

8
00:01:54,019 --> 00:02:01,989
made by... what's the dusk dev there? What's his name? Uh, the stream is probably gonna lag

9
00:02:01,989 --> 00:02:16,870
for a minute because I'm downloading a game. So I might f for a minute or so here. All right,

10
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:32,810
here we go. Let's give it a shot. That was quick. All right, I already love it. I already love this

11
00:02:32,810 --> 00:03:02,810
game. I do need to change my capturing though. Will it capture it? Hey, there it is. I already

12
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:17,819
love it. All right, look sensitivity is going down. Let's try that. Kids mode. What is kids mode? Oh,

13
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:38,789
listen to this. Wow. Whoa. The music is... Oh, oops, I didn't mean to do that. All right, let's do it.

14
00:03:40,099 --> 00:03:48,979
Okay, select difficulty. What levels with no enemies or UI? You're new to PC shooters or just

15
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:57,930
want a chill experience. Kind of chill. This is a chill stream. The intended balance for a first

16
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:09,620
playthrough or goblin mode. Uh, I'll do this one. The year is 1984. On a whim one evening you decide

17
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:15,099
to break into the local museum's basement and see what sort of treasures it might hold. One dusty

18
00:04:15,099 --> 00:04:21,110
wooden chest catches your eye. You open it and a mob of strange creatures leaps out. This particular

19
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:26,810
chest was secretly a prison for the malevolent chop goblins lured inside by the promise of

20
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:32,089
delicious cheese and trapped for untold eons. They're now loose to wreak havoc on the world

21
00:04:32,089 --> 00:04:37,610
once more. You know what must be done. Grabbing an antique dagger from a pile of dusty artifacts

22
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:43,930
you give chase. Antique dagger you grab from a nearby crate. Not the best weapon. It's better

23
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:51,459
than nothing. And a skilled welder might be able to deflect thrown projectiles with it. You can also

24
00:04:51,459 --> 00:04:55,139
do a quick dagger attack at any time regardless of what weapon you have out by pressing the use

25
00:04:55,139 --> 00:05:25,000
button. Whoa. I gotta turn sensitivity down. Uh, okay let's try it. Uh, it's gotta go even lower.

26
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:50,220
It's too low. I'm sorry it's too low. I'm gonna say 40. All right that's this is close enough.

27
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:59,300
I can't get it to where I want it. That's fine. All right Goldilocks. Sensitivity is probably the

28
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:08,680
most important thing in PC gaming. I don't care if you have a GTX 3090 or an RTX 4080.

29
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:16,360
Six monitors and like a fucking i-10 like 55 million. If your sensitivity is wrong you're

30
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:38,300
gonna do dog shit in games. Ass too. It's very fast. I gotta turn it down just a little bit though.

31
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:58,120
Okay so chop coin. Oh shit. Is there how do I parry? Wasn't there like there was like a

32
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:16,500
parry button right? Am I making that up? Get some ammo. Scared the shit out of me.

33
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:28,899
Tremor what are you playing? This is chop goblins. Oh speed runs this game up probably crazy.

34
00:07:29,779 --> 00:07:35,670
Okay fire can I take that was really stupid. That was a really dumb thing to do.

35
00:07:39,620 --> 00:08:07,079
Anymore? Do I have a map or anything? There's a gun right there. All right you know if you know

36
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:10,839
if the dusk dev is working on this and there's a there's a weapon like this in the game it's

37
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:26,620
gonna be clean. I'm just saying. Yep. How do I take out the other weapon? Wait I want to I

38
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:36,230
didn't check the other thing down here. There's another door. Where was it? Oh no just wrapped

39
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:48,759
around. Zoro? Oh my god the tannins. I forgot about my tea. Why did nobody remind me? I gotta

40
00:08:48,759 --> 00:08:59,460
take these bags out. One the other one's like all the way at the bottom. Hold on I think I can get it.

41
00:09:01,179 --> 00:09:11,029
Burn the shit out of my hand. I just reached into the tea. I just burnt my finger. All right

42
00:09:11,029 --> 00:09:25,509
I'll live. Oh boy. Yeah this thing's full of tannins. All right get them next time. Test.

43
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:58,620
No we're good. Did I get a soda? There's no jump interestingly enough. Hey good thing I was playing

44
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:04,059
Resident Evil right before this because I feel like I'm doing very well. All right where's um

45
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:09,379
oh it's E when you have a different weapon. I don't think I can switch between the two.

46
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:23,779
Very good. Oh right click does it too. Right click is way better than E.

47
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:48,940
I think I can reflect those. What do the chop coins do? Oh that's a good question.

48
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:25,990
Oh can I get one of these? I get plenty of ammo which is good. Okay I think I got everything.

49
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:41,340
Let's go out. Are you naked right now? Um no I'm actually kind of pretty sweaty right now. Does

50
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:49,500
anybody know if any of those you know those desk air conditioners. Are those things real? I kind

51
00:11:49,500 --> 00:12:05,580
of like need one. All right I need a key. They suck. I figured it was kind of meh. Why would I

52
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:16,200
do that? I tried to pick it up with E and I stabbed it. Fan. They're not fans they're these weird

53
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:43,299
chilling machines. They have to vent outside of a window. Hmm don't hit that. Oh my goodness

54
00:12:43,299 --> 00:13:07,240
there's a lot in here. I should have just lowered them all down. Whoa big coin. This is a really

55
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:17,350
British stream. Oh wait I didn't get all the things. The Chop Goblins have escaped the museum

56
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:23,500
and are running amok on the streets of your city. Sounds of wanton destruction greet you as you

57
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:29,460
exit the front doors. You catch a glimpse of several Chop Goblins disappearing into an alley.

58
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:33,220
With shock you realize they are carrying the crown jewel of the museum's collection.

59
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:40,519
The ancient Aztec time manipulation tablet. With that precious artifact they could wreak havoc not

60
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:48,389
just on your city not just on the world but on time itself. You know what you must do. The Chop

61
00:13:48,389 --> 00:13:56,950
Goblins. The Chop Goblin does are sort of like Smurfette except huge angry steeped in 1950s

62
00:13:56,950 --> 00:14:02,980
stereotypes and there's way more than one of them. Goblin does don't need cleavers to do damage.

63
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:10,100
They attack with cutting words alone. Keep some cover handy. Blinch them if they start winding up

64
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:23,830
and whatever you do don't insult their hairstyle. Oh my goodness. Oh no they chopped down the

65
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:50,169
building. They're chopping down the buildings. We gotta go stop them. Wear one of these. It's a

66
00:14:50,169 --> 00:14:54,409
baseball hat with a fan in the brim with a hole in it that's pointing down at your head.

67
00:14:58,149 --> 00:15:04,440
That's actually like I kind of want to like try it. I kind of want one of those. Is that weird?

68
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:32,279
My goodness okay that hurts. Actual skill issue here. I'm almost dead. Okay I gotta heal. I'm

69
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:56,919
almost dead. Is this still the Resident Evil 4 remake? What am I doing? Oh new weapon. Yes.

70
00:15:57,879 --> 00:16:37,100
Streets a shotgun. Oh shit. Okay all right not bad. Bathroom. You're gonna play stalker too

71
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:43,139
when it comes out? Um I think the stalker games my brain is not big enough for them.

72
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:58,500
Whoa how do I get in there? Although I did play the those old stalker games. What was it on like

73
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:06,940
master difficulty or something? I played it on some difficulty that was really really oh no like

74
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:14,569
realism. It was like realistic mode or something. What was it called? It was a different mode.

75
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:18,460
People said no I'll play on that one because that's like the best one to play on.

76
00:17:20,059 --> 00:17:34,089
Something like that. It was master. It is the recommended way to play even if you're not good.

77
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:56,859
I want all that. Yeah I just didn't really get into them. I tried playing what was it?

78
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:02,500
There was an extensive this is years ago. This is like four or five years ago now right?

79
00:18:03,059 --> 00:18:09,940
There was an extensive argument and well debate is probably better to say than argument on what

80
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:14,819
game I actually should have been playing. Is this like two or three in the original series right?

81
00:18:14,819 --> 00:18:37,420
Jesus oh my god well that was a little ridiculous. Go use the key. Did I get one? I didn't even pay

82
00:18:37,420 --> 00:19:00,740
attention. You have the key. Oh well let's go do it. What about ultra kill? I'll play the new ultra

83
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:11,269
kill patch. I'd like to wait a little bit longer though. I'd rather wait till at least a couple more

84
00:19:11,269 --> 00:19:32,009
chapters are there to play. How much is even left of the game? Is there one or two chapters left?

85
00:19:32,009 --> 00:19:52,619
Maybe three chapters left? I want to get up there. Hmm how do I get up there? This game jams. Yeah

86
00:19:52,619 --> 00:20:20,359
this is nice. There's no jump button. I like games that have little secrets like this. So there is a

87
00:20:20,359 --> 00:20:40,730
combo meter up there. They've locked the fence. What? How do you bolt cutters? You missed a lot of

88
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:46,809
secrets. Oh man I love when games have secrets. Oh man I really love when a game has secrets.

89
00:20:46,809 --> 00:20:57,609
Like I could go that way. I could go over there. I could look that way. How do I get up there? Is

90
00:20:57,609 --> 00:21:14,660
there a jump button? I just don't know what it is. Found a wand charge. Is it alt space control? No.

91
00:21:15,299 --> 00:21:39,690
Cool. Uh oh. There's a new enemy. I don't even know what they yell and if you're in line of sight

92
00:21:39,690 --> 00:22:10,150
it hurts you. What are they saying? We want some cheese. Yeah that's what they're saying. They're

93
00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:55,220
going where's the cheese? It's the lore. Oh start again. Come here. Here's some cheese. Yeah where's

94
00:22:55,220 --> 00:23:33,829
the cheese? I like the chop goblin. Oh boy. Holy shit. What just happened? Oh bolt cutters. Let's

95
00:23:33,829 --> 00:24:27,269
go. There's a gamer slo-mo. Nice. I think that's a gamer slo-mo. You can switch weapons. I mean I

96
00:24:27,269 --> 00:24:44,039
I like the shotgun. All right I got the bolt cutters. Let's go. You're related to these

97
00:24:44,039 --> 00:24:59,500
goblins. Hey yeah. Hey back off. Hey back off. How's that sound? What did that button do?

98
00:25:00,059 --> 00:25:22,740
There was an extra button. What is it? What is it? What are those? Where was the fence?

99
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:40,539
Not back here. It was way back. Goblin. Calm down bro. Hey here's an idea and just like kind of

100
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:56,539
put this around your brain for a second. Back off. Jesus. Time portal. Let's go.

101
00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:22,359
Why is he so pissed? Hey back off. A whirl of colors passes by and you emerge from the time

102
00:26:22,359 --> 00:26:29,500
portal gasping for breath. After a moment you survey your surroundings and it doesn't take

103
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:35,380
long for you to comprehend the chop goblin's plans. You're in the castle of Count Dracula.

104
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:40,859
They must mean to wake him from his eternal slumber to aid them in their evil rampage.

105
00:26:40,859 --> 00:26:48,779
A strange weapon lies in front of you seemingly fashioned to hurl wooden stakes left here by a

106
00:26:48,779 --> 00:26:53,289
doomed vampire hunter no doubt. They'll probably come in handy for the battle that's about to take

107
00:26:53,849 --> 00:27:01,460
place. The Nosperatus are Dracula's fearsome feline pets created through dark vampire magic.

108
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:05,500
Now they've joined forces with the chop goblins. Keep your distance and watch out for their lunge

109
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:51,450
attack. Oh hell yeah. MK Impaler. Clean. This, I like this zone. This sound is cool. There's one

110
00:27:51,450 --> 00:28:35,349
more. Remember did you ever have a goth phase? No I did not. A goth phase. You should start now.

111
00:28:35,349 --> 00:28:53,049
I don't think I want to start goth phase at 40. I don't know if I want to do that. Why not?

112
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:58,650
Because I don't think I can pull that shit off at 40. I can't pull that off right now.

113
00:29:05,339 --> 00:29:31,460
Yes you can. I don't think I can pull it off. Not with that attitude. Can I get in there?

114
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:38,940
Goth is ageless. Being goth is ageless. Yeah I'm just telling you I don't think I could

115
00:29:38,940 --> 00:30:04,309
pull it off right now. Goth is a lifestyle. Yeah one day should I just turn on the webcam

116
00:30:04,309 --> 00:30:12,069
and just have just like straight straight black hair like do like put like powder all over my

117
00:30:12,069 --> 00:30:19,029
face or something and have like dar like put like bags into my eyes wear like a cloak put

118
00:30:19,029 --> 00:30:29,619
be like Count Dracula for a day. Okay hold on this is like a puzzle I need to figure this out.

119
00:30:34,970 --> 00:30:51,029
Oh my goodness these things are kind of scary. Just do it on Halloween. Okay I might.

120
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:59,240
I might. I don't know. I can't. This is not a Roblox birthday party promise.

121
00:31:00,039 --> 00:31:20,200
Wait what am I doing? I need to touch that. A door somewhere has opened. I kind of already have done

122
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:36,549
this in a way with the whole like oh like Lucius Malfoy. Didn't I? Kind of. That does not count.

123
00:31:38,119 --> 00:31:49,849
I don't think Bugleberry. No Bugleberry is not goth. I don't I don't know about that. All right

124
00:31:49,849 --> 00:32:06,150
what door opened? Bugleberry to me is like are you afraid of the dark Nickelodeon. That's like

125
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:25,910
whatever that is. Like campy horror. I don't know what you would call it. Does he tell you to say

126
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:37,900
that? No I'm just it's an observation. Yeah he's like a Goosebumps villain. Yeah yeah like are you

127
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:49,049
afraid of the dark Goosebumps. I have been told that that is the intent the intent of that uh that

128
00:32:49,049 --> 00:32:52,890
is what I have been told. That that's what they were going with but he's been going for.

129
00:32:53,769 --> 00:33:32,259
Who told you that? Hey hey back off. I wonder what he's up to. True yeah I wonder what he's doing.

130
00:33:32,819 --> 00:33:52,650
That looks like something I should put up there. Wait this thing's take a lot of damage. What the

131
00:33:52,650 --> 00:34:10,460
hell is that? No honestly what the hell is that? Bam. Dude come on man. I'm gonna show this but

132
00:34:10,539 --> 00:34:20,679
like what the fuck are people doing? This is on Redbubble? Oh my god. Why? Hold on a second.

133
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:51,320
This is apparently like a like a throw blanket on Redbubble. Okay. No I uh uh I don't I don't

134
00:34:51,320 --> 00:35:01,320
want to do it. I don't want to do it. I'm not doing it. This is a fucking picture where I got

135
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:07,239
like the sun in my face from like at like TwitchCon like 2017 or something. I don't even know when

136
00:35:07,239 --> 00:35:33,300
this is. Oh my goodness. All right. Wait people actually own this thing? What? No. I okay I'm gonna

137
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:44,579
stop giving this attention. All right let's go let's keep playing this game if we have a plan.

138
00:35:47,820 --> 00:36:01,820
Vampire. Oh my goodness gracious. Okay. It's better that you don't know. Bro. All right.

139
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:40,570
How many masks do I need? Am I going backwards? Yes I am. You know I one of the reasons why

140
00:36:40,730 --> 00:36:48,869
Bugleberry is like I would say one of my uh he's like one of my favorite characters.

141
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:58,619
I love Bugleberry. I just love that old kind of Vincent Price horror kind of campy

142
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:11,099
jokey but not really a lot of inspiration from that sector there. Oh my god that scared me.

143
00:37:11,099 --> 00:37:20,710
What do you mean character? I mean he's a character. He's a character right? You know

144
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:33,769
people describe people like that. He's a character. Um where is this thing with the masks? I haven't

145
00:37:33,769 --> 00:37:47,739
been paying that much attention. All right where am I going from here? I'm kind of lost.

146
00:37:48,380 --> 00:38:25,619
Was it down? I think I'm just walking in circles. Oh okay hold on. This is new. All right that's a

147
00:38:25,619 --> 00:38:45,110
third mask. This is mobile game ad level of gameplay. What do you mean from me? I mean I

148
00:38:45,110 --> 00:39:05,900
was reading chat and talking. Yeah here it is. We're good. I know where I am. We're right here.

149
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:36,650
Oh preparing me for something.

150
00:39:50,340 --> 00:40:15,670
All right he's dead. What was he even saying? That was adorable. Again you emerge from the time

151
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:22,059
portal. Dracula's foul baritone echoing in your ears. Define yourself in ancient Greece.

152
00:40:22,059 --> 00:40:27,670
Dracula's defeat was a heavy blow to the chop goblins and you guessed that they now seek the

153
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:36,360
staff of the Corinthians. A powerful magic weapon from the anals of myth and legend. Did I say that

154
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:53,980
wrong? I think I did. Whatever. They cannot be allowed to wield such a weapon. You must first,

155
00:40:53,980 --> 00:41:03,500
you must find it first. The mods are uh having a grand old time over here with various images

156
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:13,179
and where they are put. Various blankets and um and wardrobe and uh having a having a grand old

157
00:41:13,179 --> 00:41:19,400
time. All right they can't be allowed. You must find it first and use it against them. The big

158
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:24,219
choppers are the ultimate chop goblin warriors. You weapons slow them down and they can destroy

159
00:41:24,219 --> 00:41:43,699
your health in seconds. Be careful. Any new weapons? Oh I like this area. It's anals. Anals. I know.

160
00:41:51,159 --> 00:41:54,599
I figured that out the tenth of a second after the words came out of my mouth.

161
00:41:55,239 --> 00:42:26,070
Pistol for a little bit. A little slow. I can't believe they made this in row. Oh that's still the

162
00:42:26,070 --> 00:42:42,809
title. Ah I love this. I want one of these. You know what I mean? I'm never I'm never gonna have

163
00:42:42,809 --> 00:42:51,139
one of these but if I if you told me to just okay dream dream house. I just want like a nice clear

164
00:42:51,139 --> 00:42:56,659
cool just little pool not a big one. Everybody I don't like big pools. I just want a little place

165
00:42:56,659 --> 00:43:02,340
for me to go sink and just like soak down to my chest and just like ah just for a little bit.

166
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:12,760
A shallow little pool like a little no like like a yeah like a hot tub. A hot tub that's not just

167
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:19,340
hot water. I just want to sit in a little just like this and I want it to be like a plant right

168
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:24,739
here. I want it to be like oxygen producing from like cactuses plants and shit all over here. You

169
00:43:24,739 --> 00:43:34,619
know what I'm saying? I want this exact lighting too. You want a bathtub. This is way bigger than

170
00:43:34,619 --> 00:43:43,960
a bathtub. Let's use the chop goblin as sort of a scale here. This is big enough for like five

171
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:48,920
people to sit in. I and I want it for me. I don't want anybody else sitting in this. This is for me

172
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:57,530
not for anybody else. This is not a case where like oh yeah come over here come over here and piss in

173
00:43:57,530 --> 00:44:12,539
my pool. No no no no this is for me to sit in here and decompress. Holly could use it too. Yeah no

174
00:44:12,539 --> 00:44:20,820
yeah that's no no I'm just talking no outside other outside people could use it. I wouldn't

175
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:25,699
even tell anybody I had it because you know the first second somebody would be oh my god

176
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:31,849
the second that somebody finds out you have one of those oh sick oh cool yeah and they

177
00:44:31,849 --> 00:44:39,130
stood there taking their shirt off. He's like no we're not uh yeah we could but uh oh dude really

178
00:44:39,130 --> 00:44:46,199
you got a little a little pool like that let's go I'm getting in. No no no no no don't go in that.

179
00:44:46,199 --> 00:44:57,769
I don't know probably a weirdo if you want. It's all right man just dump a bunch of shock in it.

180
00:45:00,489 --> 00:45:07,849
I'm sorry I puked in your nice pristine pool. No just don't shock in here it'll be fine. No what?

181
00:45:07,849 --> 00:45:12,570
No I want a clean pool. I don't want to even fucking puke in my pool. I don't want to piss in my pool.

182
00:45:16,940 --> 00:45:22,460
Sorry man I accidentally I peed and shit in your pool but it's all right just that white powder

183
00:45:22,460 --> 00:45:27,579
that you sprinkle in that like with chemicals just dump it in there and it'll get rid of the puke.

184
00:45:30,059 --> 00:45:31,739
Oh dude you're never coming over again.

185
00:45:40,179 --> 00:45:47,110
Dude you got weird friends. Why are people doing this in your pool?

186
00:45:49,369 --> 00:45:58,059
Nobody ever says that. Nobody ever says they're doing that but they do and you know what?

187
00:45:58,780 --> 00:46:10,489
Shame on you. Shame on you. I wonder I wonder I wonder like you know oh like pissing yeah

188
00:46:11,130 --> 00:46:22,539
shame on you and you can't here's the thing about a pool there is no verifying anything in a pool

189
00:46:22,539 --> 00:46:29,420
a lot of times there is absolutely no verification so somebody could just be in there pissing and

190
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:35,849
it's just like I have no idea and nobody else does and no one will ever know there's no verification

191
00:46:35,849 --> 00:46:58,219
when somebody goes in a pool oh that hurts oh they weren't kidding that actually hurt a lot

192
00:46:58,780 --> 00:47:11,960
I got a huge raid slime cycle thanks to the raid welcome everybody we're just chilling out playing

193
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:16,760

194
00:47:17,559 --> 00:47:23,380

195
00:47:23,380 --> 00:47:29,500

196
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:30,860
things I would really like to have

197
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:43,900

level all right can I not get in here yeah we're just chilling appreciate it though

199
00:48:18,019 --> 00:48:23,989

210
00:50:43,219 --> 00:50:47,460
and after a week you come back and they you have like a blindfold on and you take it off in the

211
00:50:47,460 --> 00:50:53,449
living room and it's like oh my goodness look at all this it doesn't matter what my house or

212
00:50:53,449 --> 00:50:58,570
what my apartment whatever it looked like before just in the middle of the living room just make

213
00:50:58,570 --> 00:51:05,670
a nice pristine blue square chest high pool and I'm gonna cry I'm gonna do this I'm gonna be like

214
00:51:05,670 --> 00:51:14,329
I can't even look what they put in they put the pool they did what I liked I would cry

215
00:51:17,820 --> 00:51:21,659
and they could be rotten wood all over here and I wouldn't matter as long as I was there

216
00:51:22,380 --> 00:51:45,530
all right this game just got this game just got a little harder good I don't have any ammo I need

217
00:51:45,530 --> 00:52:01,269
to get ammo with this gun equipped thank you those guys hurt a lot I should probably parry

218
00:52:01,989 --> 00:52:22,730
can I parry those are they too big maybe I actually did it thank goodness yeah it but the

219
00:52:22,730 --> 00:52:34,099
water has to be faintly lit with like a light blue like kind of slightly teal light and the

220
00:52:34,099 --> 00:53:00,179
twinsons odyssey soundtrack has to play in the background all right just pull them in here why

221
00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:28,380
look it up look up that soundtrack and you tell me why I should play that game on stream nice

222
00:53:29,260 --> 00:53:47,320
you should play every game of existence on steam I don't think uh

223
00:53:48,199 --> 00:53:53,980
twinsons odyssey is on steam is it it's the sequel to little big adventure a little big

224
00:53:53,980 --> 00:54:07,260
venture 2 it's on steam what how did I not know that that's like in my top that's probably my

225
00:54:07,260 --> 00:54:27,699
top 20 favorite games ever made it's on steam buddy ooh okay add that to the list hello trinch

226
00:54:28,340 --> 00:54:34,940
how great is mr twinson I have I done this I feel like I've played this on no maybe not maybe not

227
00:54:38,090 --> 00:54:46,489
those of you that know you know about that game but I don't know maybe not maybe I thought about

228
00:54:46,489 --> 00:54:51,289
wanting to do it years ago and I just never did it there's a remaster of the two games coming up

229
00:54:51,289 --> 00:55:06,760
and lba3 has been announced you're gonna make me cry do not put the lba2 soundtrack on in my pool

230
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:35,699
and tell me that there is a sequel coming out while I soak in this did I think so I don't know

231
00:55:35,699 --> 00:55:43,739
who did the voice acting in that game but it is unironically and I mean this I mean this 100

232
00:55:43,739 --> 00:55:54,900
truthfully that game has some of the best voice acting of any game I've ever played get those

233
00:55:54,900 --> 00:56:03,980
coins um I will it's no I think it's less than a few people even doing the voice work and they do

234
00:56:03,980 --> 00:56:10,230
dozens of characters and they're so good there's so much life and so much energy and so much

235
00:56:11,030 --> 00:56:17,860
passion in that voice work it just trust me when I tell you it's phenomenal the characters that

236
00:56:17,860 --> 00:56:24,360
people do oh the elephant voices oh my goodness you're gonna make me cry all right I didn't get

237
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:32,730
the coins why are you walking in circles uh oh right should we should we tell all right let's

238
00:56:32,730 --> 00:56:37,050
tell them when I get on a topic uh I will just walk in a circle and just forget that I'm playing

239
00:56:37,050 --> 00:56:42,170
a video game and just it's probably annoying I'm sorry I've been doing this for like 12 years

240
00:56:42,170 --> 00:56:49,510
I'm sorry has there ever been a time when I played a game and didn't just like absent-mindedly go on

241
00:56:49,510 --> 00:57:09,849
autopilot in a circle while I was talking no it's never happened oh nice you don't have a

242
00:57:09,849 --> 00:57:16,630
multitasking talent you know I can carry a lot of things at the same time I don't know if that

243
00:57:16,630 --> 00:57:25,579
counts but you bet your ass I'm getting the entire grocery run in one go does that count

244
00:57:32,659 --> 00:57:38,420
that's multitasking you got one on your pinky hanging one on your thumb one sort of wrapped

245
00:57:38,420 --> 00:57:44,659
around your left hand one gripped you have it bunched up tight you take the two ends and you

246
00:57:44,659 --> 00:57:53,559
bunch it up tight you got like 10 bags in your hand that's just a that's not a multitask oh can

247
00:57:53,559 --> 00:58:10,059
you sing while you do it too okay back off what's the point of this room it's the build the wall

248
00:58:10,139 --> 00:58:14,139
break the wall rebuild the wall in Minecraft as you've called it before yeah

249
00:58:19,030 --> 00:58:31,619
is there anything I missed in here oh no several doors have opened apparently

250
00:58:32,820 --> 00:58:59,449
wait here we go oh I think I just like natural shit remember I told you one of my favorite things

251
00:58:59,449 --> 00:59:06,010
is the sticky kind of gooey lava where it's charcoal looking and then they hit it with that

252
00:59:06,010 --> 00:59:16,010
little stick and it opens up and it's like lava I want a room like this too in my house it's like

255
00:59:48,179 --> 01:00:02,199
have gone into something to do with that it's still time it's still time I hope this doesn't

258
01:00:51,179 --> 01:00:56,760
sunscreen all over my nose I have like a bowling shirt on with a camera around my neck and a

259
01:00:56,760 --> 01:01:02,519
fanny pack and have my wrists both of them planted on my back walking around and following the other

01:02:35,670 --> 01:03:05,429
that so the wand is stored in this temple the correct symbols must be nearby symbols are nearby

268
01:03:18,199 --> 01:03:38,760

where to my neighbor got a new car today and he's been standing outside staring at it while eating

274
01:05:33,619 --> 01:06:06,900
chips 15 minutes oh I get that I get that well it's pretty good again you find yourself in a

275
01:06:06,900 --> 01:06:13,130
whirlwind of colors the last thing you heard was the familiar sound the az tech time manipulation

276
01:06:13,130 --> 01:06:18,650
tablet activating this must be their final dreadful bid for victory you emerge in a desolate

277
01:06:18,650 --> 01:06:25,960
wasteland a future that is not what could be they've transported you to an alternate timeline

278
01:06:25,960 --> 01:06:33,539
a grimy sci-fi dystopia where the chop goblins already won you stand in their vile capital city

279
01:06:33,539 --> 01:06:38,920
chopping grad surrounded by the ruins of human civilization in front of a strange industrial

280
01:06:38,920 --> 01:06:46,469
structure must be their hq you grip the staff of the corinthians with rage a world overrun by

281
01:06:46,469 --> 01:06:54,119
chop goblins just means more chop goblins to shoot it's time for the final battle the hack

282
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:59,980
goblinators are part goblin part machine they have transcended the bounds of flesh

283
01:06:59,980 --> 01:07:04,809
and are faster and more cunning than the other chop goblins relentlessly flanking their foes

284
01:07:04,809 --> 01:07:24,099
and attacking with deadly laser cleavers final level I think so I only have six more shots with

285
01:07:24,099 --> 01:07:27,559
this I don't think I'm going to use it till the very end this is my resident evil rocket launcher

286
01:07:29,159 --> 01:07:49,590
whoa okay they're already I gotta learn the reflect is so powerful probably I can't I love

287
01:07:49,590 --> 01:08:19,210
this music play lifeline again no no way that I think I'm just sealed that's getting sealed

288
01:08:19,210 --> 01:08:30,600
it's permanently didn't I beat it I beat that game already didn't I or did I just pretend that I did

289
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:38,220
in my brain so I don't ever play it again yeah I beat it the game was hell that old ps2

290
01:08:38,300 --> 01:08:46,039
mic was so bad yeah I remember the very end the blast battle was that huge robotic monster thing

291
01:08:46,039 --> 01:09:17,210
right I can't believe I actually beat that game um where do I go oh that's cool a motherboard

292
01:09:17,210 --> 01:10:05,220
building didn't miss something where's the where's game progress the lever I didn't pull why did I

293
01:10:05,220 --> 01:10:27,060
do that you beat it I don't think I did it's to your left did you play seaman again no you guys

294
01:10:27,060 --> 01:10:36,710
have to understand the reason why the oh the re hold on the reason why those games were some

295
01:10:36,710 --> 01:10:40,630
of the longest streams I've ever done is because I didn't want to turn those games on ever again

296
01:10:41,510 --> 01:10:45,989
because I know if I turned the dreamcast off that game would never be opened again

297
01:10:46,630 --> 01:10:50,229
so I had to stick with it because that was the only time you were ever going to see that

298
01:10:50,229 --> 01:11:04,300
so it had to be like a 13 hour 14 hour stream same thing with the lord of the rings games

299
01:11:05,020 --> 01:11:09,420
those old lord of the rings games were so hard and just so crazy it's so frustrating

300
01:11:10,300 --> 01:11:18,300
there's no way I was gonna open it again and you know that if I didn't beat those games in one day

301
01:11:21,369 --> 01:11:27,449
you guys would a week would go by hey dude no that lord of the rings stream was really really fun

302
01:11:27,449 --> 01:11:33,260
and really funny like that you are you gonna ever finish it yeah yeah I don't know maybe like in a

303
01:11:33,260 --> 01:11:37,340
maybe some point soon then a year will go by and it's never it's never happened

304
01:11:37,979 --> 01:12:01,420
I need ammo I reflect it wait where's this dead what about pajama sam

305
01:12:05,130 --> 01:12:12,659

311
01:13:57,979 --> 01:14:11,340
