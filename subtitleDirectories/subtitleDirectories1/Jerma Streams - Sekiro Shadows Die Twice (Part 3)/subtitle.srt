1
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:28,100
Hey, it's me, Jeffrey. Liar. What do you mean, liar? That scared me. Don't be scared. Hey,

2
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:39,399
Jeffrey. Jeffrey's the name of your cat. It's also the name of the Toys R Us giraffe.

3
00:00:42,539 --> 00:00:46,060
Is the Toys R Us giraffe still in the commercials? Does Toys R Us still have commercials?

4
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:54,390
Or did they blow their entire advertising budget in like 96 and then just hope that

5
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:58,869
the 500 million dollars they spend every day on TV, people just remember who they are.

6
00:01:07,349 --> 00:01:17,159
They're bankrupt. Well, looks like somebody had to grow up eventually. I don't want to grow up. I'm a

7
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:22,920
Toys R Us kid. Until the fucking tax man comes and the 400 franchises you have go under.

8
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:43,500
Gonna have to grow up. What's with all like the sad faces? You haven't even shopped there.

9
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,900
What was the last time you've been to Toys R Us? You haven't even probably seen the

10
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:57,590
inside of it. You probably never even google image searched Toys R Us. Makes me sad to

11
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:08,520
remember. Toy grocery store. I don't like this meme, Jeff. Bring back Jerma. All right.

12
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:33,620
All right, I'll be right back. Hey, guys. It's me, Jerma. I'm the friendly one.

13
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:48,219
That's a good coffee. Do a co-op stream with Jeffrey. Nah. We're gonna go back to Sekiro.

14
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:54,969
It took a couple days to get better. I was feeling, as you know from the last stream,

15
00:02:54,969 --> 00:03:06,069
a little fucked up. A little under the weather. And I'm feeling a little better. So without further

16
00:03:06,069 --> 00:03:11,659
ado, we're gonna pick up exactly where we left off. I haven't even opened the game,

17
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:24,740
which has been hard because I've really wanted to play. Kick the plebs out. What? Why? Oh,

18
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:34,500
you're talking about sub only. Do it. Wait. Easy. Hold on. Like we could wait a few minutes.

19
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:43,620
Doesn't have to be immediate sub only. He's gonna play terrible because it's been two

20
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:49,539
days. No, that's not true. I should do fairly well because I see it in real life. I picked up

21
00:03:49,539 --> 00:03:55,860
a broom and I told Talix and Kim to both like throw shit at me and to both like come at me

22
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:59,139
with like all kinds of weapons and stuff. And I like was blocking them and parrying them.

23
00:04:01,289 --> 00:04:06,389
So I've been in real life. I've been practicing. Yeah. Kim, like just pick up

24
00:04:06,389 --> 00:04:10,580
that fucking phone and just throw it at me. I don't want it to just do it. I'm ready.

25
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:17,019
And then hit me right in the fucking mouth. Broke all my teeth. But you get good, right? I went

26
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:30,579
to the hospital. Got good. You know, got a $2,500 hospital bill. Got it. You know, let's go.

27
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:44,100
Sub only now. Not yet. Where even are we? So those of you that don't know, this is secure

28
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:50,470
row shadow stacked wise. Uh, we were going down through the sunken temple.

29
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:56,579
Let me just like remember the buttons. Hold on. Right trigger. Right trigger. Right trigger.

30
00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:09,209
Oh yeah. Okay. Now I remember. I remember. So this is the sniper roost. Does this game have a

31
00:05:09,209 --> 00:05:14,490
multiplayer? I don't know. It does not. There is no multiplayer in this game. No invasions. No.

32
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:23,019
Well, that's a lot of stuff over there. That's probably a trap though. Uh, let's just go get

33
00:05:23,019 --> 00:05:31,180
it. Is it a trap? Oh, I can see that. Can I jump up there? No, no, no, no. Okay. Well,

34
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:33,819
now it's something we learned. We've, we've remembered that this forward momentum,

35
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:40,069
uh, this forward momentum in secure. All right. If I, if you jump, you kind of just jump forward.

36
00:05:40,069 --> 00:05:45,319
That's not a death. Doesn't count. People are counting those. I want to make it very clear.

37
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:50,600
That's not a death. It takes away like 30%, 40% of your health bar. Not a death.

38
00:05:53,800 --> 00:06:01,860
All right, let's just go. I hear something. I think I hear a goofball over here. Oh my God.

39
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:11,060
What the fuck is that? Okay. Well, it begins. That's like Wolverine. That's like they dug

40
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:18,410
up Wolverine a hundred years after he died. And this is probably a boss. Yep. Long arm centipede

41
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:35,689
giraffe. Okay. Nice to meet you. What is this name? What kind of name is this? Oh shit. It's

42
00:06:35,689 --> 00:06:43,220
Jeffrey from Toys R Us. All right. So he's got one, two, three, four, two, three, four,

43
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:49,139
five, six. Is that all he does? Well, he's fucking relentless. That's for sure. All right.

44
00:06:51,399 --> 00:07:07,449
So it's one, two, three, four. That face. Okay. I got it. That's a slash. I don't know.

45
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:14,629
So I got it. You just got to carry the fuck out of this guy. So we got a slash

46
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:22,839
and then we're just going to make it come in. One, two, three. See you later. One down.

47
00:07:22,839 --> 00:07:34,490
No, I didn't get it. Okay. This one. What am I facing? What the fuck was that?

48
00:07:34,569 --> 00:07:43,290
Why was I facing backwards? Oh my God. That was stupid. That was stupid. Why was my back turned?

49
00:07:44,089 --> 00:08:11,529
I can get it right here. That was actually stupid. Again. Again. Dad, you're dead.

50
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:18,120
Okay. That was fucking dumb. I had my back to him. Like he was just hitting me right in the

51
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:32,220
ass. Anyways, he's dead. Yellow gunpowder. Sick. I gotta get that mouse off the screen.

52
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:43,850
Oh, he beat Jeffrey first try. Yeah. Back to the bankruptcy board with you, Jeffrey. That's,

53
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:49,580
I'm not saying that. That's like not nice. So this is a prosthetic tool upgrades. Prayer beads.

54
00:08:57,159 --> 00:09:04,100
Nice. Oh, that was fun. He was fairly easy. Not, well, the easy is the wrong term. Fairly

55
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:17,190
predictably. Just the same kind of chain. Some scrap. Nice. A large fan. A large fan

56
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:23,179
made of dyed red Japanese Aralia leaves can be fit into the prosthetic tool. Fanning it creates

57
00:09:23,179 --> 00:09:32,070
a large vortex of wind. Spiriting away those it catches. Okay. So it was like a little knockback

58
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:47,110
or something. That's probably a knockback. Can I look in here? Gun for shrine key. All right.

59
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:54,330
So that's just like a little mini boss in front of them. There was a place to go down

60
00:09:54,330 --> 00:10:03,860
here. I don't want to start a new area until, there we go. Yellow gunpowder. More

61
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:14,490
upgrade materials. I still have a little bit of a cough, so you're going to hear it a few times.

62
00:10:19,139 --> 00:10:24,059
All right. Well, there's no reason why I wouldn't just refill my shit, right?

63
00:10:24,059 --> 00:10:46,200
He's not going to respawn. Okay. I got my recoveries back. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. All right.

64
00:10:47,000 --> 00:11:00,820
Sunken Valley passage. We have nothing over here. Now everybody, now don't get too excited.

65
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:04,179
Don't get too excited, everybody. Because I saw the trailer for the game.

66
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:07,940
And unfortunately, if you see a trailer for a video game, you're spoiled at the fact that

67
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:12,330
the giant snake is going to come up here and attack me right now. I did see the trailer.

68
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:25,299
I told you. I saw the trailer. I saw the trailer in the game. Why did I watch the trailer?

69
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:49,220
How do I get out of here? I'm assuming this way. It was part of like the E3 presentation.

70
00:11:49,220 --> 00:12:04,389
And like I, I knew what was going to happen. Fight this now? Boat kick for spoilers.

71
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:14,470
Is it a spoiler? If two years ago they showed that. Oh Jesus. He's right here.

72
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:26,629
All right. I'm sorry. Let me apologize because I'm realizing something right now.

73
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:32,870
Like I saw the movie. You got, some of you guys may not have seen the movie.

74
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:38,789
So we were both watching infinity war right there. And right before like the big climax,

75
00:12:38,789 --> 00:12:43,059
I told you what happened. Hey, did I, I've seen this movie before? Have you seen this movie?

76
00:12:43,059 --> 00:12:46,580
No, I haven't. Oh, well dude, uh, watch what happens when, uh, when he gets killed right here.

77
00:12:47,539 --> 00:12:53,769
Oh, okay. Yeah, it was cool. Huh? Did you like it? Yeah, I guess I did.

78
00:13:01,179 --> 00:13:03,899
Vote kick. You can't vote kick me on my own damn. All right. But there's something

79
00:13:03,899 --> 00:13:11,029
going on here. What do I, can I like slash him through here? Can I kill this thing?

80
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:24,809
Uh, what's wrong with him? Can I jump up on his body?

81
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:38,470
I mean, that's very clearly making a bridge. All right. I gotta get to his

82
00:13:38,549 --> 00:13:45,370
plant. Oh shit. He's staring at me. Is there anywhere I can grapple to over here?

83
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:56,519
Looking for a grapple point so I can at least make my way up on him

84
00:13:57,159 --> 00:14:09,860
because I can't grab him. I wonder if he's going to attack me from here.

85
00:14:11,669 --> 00:14:31,159
Okay. So he's just set up for me to walk on it. Well, I made it. Oh, hey, by the way,

86
00:14:31,159 --> 00:14:34,919
I watched a walkthrough up here. Just wait till I split his whole body in half. I do

87
00:14:34,919 --> 00:14:39,799
this thing where I jump and it's a really farm software really over did themselves here.

88
00:14:39,799 --> 00:14:44,919
You jump and you hold the sword out through his mouth and you zipline down his whole body

89
00:14:44,919 --> 00:14:48,679
to be able to traverse the gap there and you cut the whole body in half while you

90
00:14:48,679 --> 00:15:09,659
zipline down through his whole body. I think we just go up, right? Item.

91
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:20,299
Adamantiaite scrap. You're a jerk. This is, this is the cool part right here.

92
00:15:26,169 --> 00:15:47,899
What I remember for the trailer. Oh, oh, almost. Uh, any more like monkeys that jump

93
00:15:47,899 --> 00:15:58,919
down. I guess I have to jump for, wait, somebody can see me. He doesn't, he can't get up here,

94
00:15:58,919 --> 00:16:16,100
right? I highly doubt he can. Can he? I don't think it matters. He has a gun. Okay. Well,

95
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:29,159
that's great to know. Not going to happen. All right. So from here, I need to drop down

96
00:16:29,159 --> 00:16:42,419
there. Do a monkey voice. I don't have any monkey voices. There's an item over there.

97
00:16:42,500 --> 00:17:15,190
I'm going to get that. Do it. I, no, I can't. You literally can. You happy? There's an item

98
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:24,460
down here, right? Where was that item? I saw it from far away. Uh-huh. Oh, YouTuber reactions.

99
00:17:26,009 --> 00:17:39,640
Whoa. Whoa. Oh shoot, guys. Shoot. Well, I got more snap seeds. Probably going to need them.

100
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:50,490
Can you not swear? No, I'm a swearer. Sorry, guys. I say like poop.

101
00:17:52,710 --> 00:18:16,579
Shit. No, I think he's starting to run out of content. Just the fuck up one. All right. Down

102
00:18:16,579 --> 00:18:25,269
or up? Ooh, I don't, let's go down. There's actually a, can I get back up if I go down

103
00:18:25,269 --> 00:18:46,339
here? Let's see. Oh shit. There's like three in here. I think. Yep. Oh boy. Oh, you do a

104
00:18:46,339 --> 00:18:58,819
lot of damage too. Jesus. Oh Jesus. Get me out. Okay. Here comes one that actually,

105
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:17,130
this is a really bad place to fight anyone. God damn it. I have like firecrackers. What the

106
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:37,029
fuck am I doing? I just forget. Wow. That's the easiest way to get rid of them. Damn. All

107
00:19:37,029 --> 00:19:55,160
right. What the fuck? Okay. This is the surprise level. Contact medicine, weak poison

108
00:19:55,160 --> 00:20:26,740
status have been inflicted. Okay. Yeah. Where? Okay. Back it up. All right. Where are they? I

109
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:37,460
don't even know where they're all coming from. There is an item here though. I think.

110
00:20:38,259 --> 00:20:53,819
Think. No, I think it was just the spirit emblems. I might be missing things.

111
00:20:54,700 --> 00:21:23,160
Nope. It's right there. There's actually two. One down here. Sugar. I hear movement. That

112
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:32,019
better not be what I think it is. I see green. I got a story for you guys. By the way,

113
00:21:32,019 --> 00:21:40,680
this is a true story. This happened last night. Do you want to hear something fucking insane?

114
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:46,869
So me and Kim have been sick, right? And the reason why I'm looking at down is because

115
00:21:46,869 --> 00:21:50,630
it reminds me of ecto cooler. And if that, but let me just finish my last statement.

116
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:55,750
If that's a poison swamp, this is the worst game ever made. So let's just be clear on

117
00:21:55,750 --> 00:22:02,440
that. Uh, but anyways, so last night, Kim and I were in bed and we're doing our usual

118
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:07,880
ritual where we just sit there and look on our iPads, iPhones, just watching random videos.

119
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:12,119
We kind of just like at a certain point, stop talking and just read and look at stuff,

120
00:22:12,119 --> 00:22:20,630
right? Like good night. Good night. Okay. Yeah. So I was watching a video of this guy

121
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:23,430
because I don't know. I sometimes I get on a kick where I just want to see like things

122
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:28,869
from the eighties and old sixties commercials and well, ecto cooler. Let me read about

123
00:22:28,869 --> 00:22:33,349
that. That sounds cool. And I got on a kick on the ecto cooler from high sea, which is the

124
00:22:33,349 --> 00:22:39,190
ghost busters tie in, right? I just was looking at stuff about it. So there's a guy on YouTube

125
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:44,059
that had one from 30 years ago and he was going to drink it. He's like, Oh, I got a

126
00:22:44,059 --> 00:22:49,500
found one. It was original packaging. It's been expired for 30 years. And he opens it up and

127
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:53,019
he starts talking about it. And the whole time I'm just paying attention to it. And Kim's

128
00:22:53,019 --> 00:22:56,779
watching whatever she's watching, look, you know, looking the other way. So he eventually

129
00:22:56,779 --> 00:23:04,039
gets it into a glass and he drinks it. And instantly, not even five seconds goes by,

130
00:23:04,119 --> 00:23:08,920
he fucking pukes projectile throw up coming out of his mouth. And I was like, Oh, that's

131
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:14,970
fucked up. Kim looks over, sees the prop, the puke coming out of his mouth. First time

132
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:18,809
she's paid attention to anything I've been doing in probably two hours. She has an

133
00:23:18,809 --> 00:23:24,490
immediate reflex. If Kim sees another person like throw up, she has an immediate throw up

134
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:31,130
reflex. So she fucking sprints to the bathroom, all puking like, and I'm laughing

135
00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:34,410
my ass off. I can't fucking believe it. Like that, that's, that's the shit that she caught

136
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:38,970
me watching like an ecto cooler video. So I'm laughing. Remember, I have a cough. I

137
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:44,089
start coughing uncontrollably. I'm in pain, laughing hysterically while I hear her fucking

138
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:50,009
like puking in the toilet. I can't help it anymore. I am in a full coughing fit.

139
00:23:50,009 --> 00:23:56,410
I get the fuck out of bed. I go over to the sink and I start fucking puking in the

140
00:23:56,410 --> 00:24:03,609
sink. I'm not kidding. This is a real fucking story. And I was still laughing.

141
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:18,390
So it was like, this is a real story. This is 100% true. I thought italics was good. I think he

142
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:23,559
was still streaming at the time. This was at like two, three, four, like the clock in the

143
00:24:23,559 --> 00:24:28,599
morning. He was still live. So he didn't hear us. I thought we were going to wake him up

144
00:24:28,599 --> 00:24:35,430
and he was going to think we were fucking dying in here. I, that is fucking real.

145
00:24:38,299 --> 00:24:42,700
I didn't puke that much though. It wasn't like a full puke. It was like

146
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:56,519
funny. It was the fucking funniest thing all year. I think Star made this comment before

147
00:24:57,779 --> 00:25:04,180
and I adhere to it completely. He said, he said in the past, I wish if I could go back and have

148
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:11,210
like HD cameras record something in my life, I would want it to be X, right? If there was

149
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:15,609
like two or three cameras in the bathroom and like in the bedroom and stuff, I would love to

150
00:25:15,609 --> 00:25:27,319
see that footage. The whole thing play up. That's so many. Oh my God.

151
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:37,450
You're not supposed to fight those. You're not supposed to fight those monkeys over here.

152
00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:44,440
Nope. That's a joke how many there are. How am I supposed to get over there?

153
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:49,299
I have to climb. I have to go across this way. There's no way you're going to make that.

154
00:25:50,339 --> 00:26:07,910
Oh Jesus. What the hell you were doing? Just firecracker them.

155
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:27,480
Oh, this is going to be a death here. God damn it. I'll try. I'll try. All right. I'm going in.

156
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,720
Not yet. Wait, wait, wait. Let me just get like the item that's over here.

157
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:37,420
There's like shit. Okay. This shit like over. No, there's not. I'm already good to go.

158
00:26:41,539 --> 00:27:05,319
Three, two, one. I'm going to get so many points for this. I can't, I can't call you

159
00:27:05,319 --> 00:27:43,109
right now. This is not even hard. This is not even fun. I don't even want to do this

160
00:27:43,109 --> 00:28:06,519
anymore. All right. They're getting me close. Hey, in Sekiro. This is a from software game.

161
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:17,720
You either die or you don't die. I'm sorry. How much money was that? Wow. Nothing actually.

162
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:33,579
They get monkey booze. I got monkey booze. Okay. A bunch of community subs came in and

163
00:28:33,579 --> 00:28:40,569
I missed them. My phone was ringing. Community subs came in and I had to fight like 15 monkeys.

164
00:28:40,569 --> 00:28:44,039
More than that. How many community subs just came in? I didn't see.

165
00:28:44,759 --> 00:28:56,869
It was like at least five to ten, right? Five, five. All right. Awesome.

166
00:28:57,430 --> 00:29:00,920
This Jerma lied about Minecraft VR. Thank you so much, dude.

167
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:09,779
More community subs from Jerma lied about Minecraft VR. I kind of like this area.

168
00:29:09,779 --> 00:29:13,220
Until I look, until that's a poison swamp. And if it is, then you know,

169
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:26,579
that's two fold letter grades down. If this game is at an A right now,

170
00:29:26,579 --> 00:29:33,720
that makes it a C minus. Oh shit. Okay. There's an idol there,

171
00:29:37,349 --> 00:29:50,069
but points can be added back up. You know what I mean? I'm going to get this first in case I

172
00:29:50,069 --> 00:29:56,339
can't get back up. Well, that looks like a big, that's a mini boss probably.

173
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:15,079
I crashed your computer by killing the monkeys. No, I didn't. I'm still waiting for one more

174
00:30:15,079 --> 00:30:20,470
to get this because that's a pretty big deal. I don't have enough of that. All right. Let me

175
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:34,660
go look and see what's down here. There's an item down this way. Balloon of soul. Yeah,

176
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:44,599
that's, that's a, that's a green swamp. All right. Let's try to fight this. See,

177
00:30:45,559 --> 00:30:52,819
thankfully this run back is pretty easy. It's just right here. Let me just get that

178
00:30:52,819 --> 00:31:18,579
little health back. All right. Here we go. Just checking. Just checking. He's huge. Well,

179
00:31:18,579 --> 00:31:26,220
I'm already seeing that there's a lot of things to grab onto here. How did you even

180
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:46,980
see me? Jesus. You have to fly around here. He's trying to see what it does. What about this?

181
00:31:47,779 --> 00:32:01,109
It's affected a lot by that. Sweep. It is. I'm assuming it's a lot of sweeps. Whoa, that hurts.

182
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:20,099
Get me out. Get me out. Get me out. Get me out. Here's a run in. Oh shit. Oh, that's

183
00:32:20,099 --> 00:32:31,779
a blow. That's an instant kill. All right. Whoa. I don't even know. I don't think you

184
00:32:31,779 --> 00:33:04,119
can dodge it. Do I have to deflect that shit? Maybe. Oh, he's shitting in his hand. All right.

185
00:33:05,049 --> 00:33:31,289
That's what that is. It's hard to get that. It's all right. This thing where he spins around

186
00:33:31,849 --> 00:33:40,519
and like whizzes around and shit. You can't go in, but he does that. Okay.

187
00:33:43,829 --> 00:34:06,470
Can't follow that up. Oh, he comes out of that quick. I don't have any heal. Oh boy. Oh

188
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:12,230
boy. Where was he going? He's going to shit at me. Okay. You can, you can block it.

189
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:38,010
One down here. Oh, that's not it. That was a grab. Whoa. All right. He did like four sweeps

190
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:59,110
in a row and it went for a grab. Sounds about right. Let's go again. I'm going to get in there

191
00:34:59,110 --> 00:35:23,380
quick. Try to get a couple hits on him now. Never mind. What does that wiggle look like?

192
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:32,780
Fuck. I didn't block it. Fuck. No, not already. I don't think I should be parrying him. He

193
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:56,010
does a ton of posture damage. Like almost unrelenting. Give me help. Oh fuck. It's okay.

194
00:35:57,130 --> 00:36:12,980
I got to use these more wisely. That's like, that's the key here. Oh fuck. He's like

195
00:36:13,619 --> 00:36:38,099
stunned. Damn. I got to block that poison thing. He's around. He comes again.

196
00:36:40,780 --> 00:37:05,480
Comes to shit. I'm like waiting for it. That's what I wanted to do. All right. All

197
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:12,679
right. Easy. Easy. That's the grab. Oh, that sucks. It's so hard to determine. No.

198
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:31,670
Again. No, that was a sweep. Shitting. Oh, there it is again. My God. That's what that's

199
00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:49,320
good for. He does like a little shimmy. Damn. Oh, that like symbol and into the moves. It's

200
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:58,309
like the hardest thing to get on in this game because your brain sees the symbol and then you

201
00:37:58,550 --> 00:38:06,340
kind of just panic for a second and go, which one is it? Which one is it? I'll get him this time.

202
00:38:18,579 --> 00:38:29,530
What? What the hell? I just wasted two somehow. I got to be closer to that.

203
00:38:30,250 --> 00:39:14,710
I think I'm just going to jump every time. Wiggle. Wiggle. Wiggle. To cool down. Fuck.

204
00:39:27,000 --> 00:40:05,340
Oh, that hurts. Oh God. What's he doing? Easy. Here comes the poop. Here comes the poop.

205
00:40:14,409 --> 00:40:57,110
Fucking camera. Please don't do this to me, camera. This time. He hasn't done shit at all.

206
00:40:58,070 --> 00:41:26,860
Eat it. Easy. Back it up. Don't get greedy. Damn it. Not close enough.

207
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:49,030
What am I? Oh, he shit on me. Oh no. This is bad. Hold on. What the fuck? What? What's

208
00:41:49,030 --> 00:42:14,940
going on here? Use. I can't use this? That was weird. All right. Come on. Back it up. Back

209
00:42:14,940 --> 00:43:15,079
it up. Too much. Back it up. What do you got? Oh, don't get greedy. Fuck. Here comes the shit.

210
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:25,590
Fuck. All right. Come on. Come on. Come on. I got two resurrects here. I got it.

211
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:35,900
Oh my God. I thought that was going to stun him or something. Oh fuck. Oh my God. Oh,

212
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:38,860
why did I do that? I had, I've like, I thought it was going to like get hit.

213
00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:49,030
Damn it. Damn it. Damn it. Damn it. For some reason, I thought when you latch onto them,

214
00:43:49,030 --> 00:43:55,929
you have like immunity or something. No, I don't have any pellets either. I gotta get this on the

215
00:43:55,929 --> 00:44:05,750
bar. Fuck man. That was close. Yeah, I have no pellets. Get that on the bar. Damn it. That

216
00:44:05,750 --> 00:44:22,949
was close. Anything else I need? Maybe it might be worth putting one of these on here.

217
00:44:23,670 --> 00:44:45,269
I want posture. Posture. Fuck. So this is the poison one. Man, I'm so like riled up right

218
00:44:45,269 --> 00:44:55,019
now too. Damn it. That was so close. I need to take like a sip. I'm like a lightning rod right

219
00:44:55,019 --> 00:45:15,480
now. Damn it. I thought that was the one too. It's all right. Let's go. I'll tell you,

220
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:18,119
the first two firecrackers, remember how they didn't land for some reason?

221
00:45:19,219 --> 00:45:24,179
I feel like that's a victory right there. That was, you know, but whatever. I can't be mad

222
00:45:24,179 --> 00:45:43,559
about that. I really wish I could attach. Let's see. No, god damn it. That's bad. This is a bad

223
00:45:43,559 --> 00:45:57,190
start. Really bad start. Yeah, this is an awful start. Kill me. I'm gonna do it. That was just

224
00:45:57,190 --> 00:46:10,519
a bad start. Hey Magellan, thanks for the five community subs. Magellan, 36. Five subs. Thank

225
00:46:10,519 --> 00:46:30,230
you. I gotta land all of them. I don't need to, I can just get a couple in here. I don't need

226
00:46:30,230 --> 00:46:47,739
to do anything. Save the shit when I need it. Get away from that poison. Take the shit.

227
00:46:48,619 --> 00:47:12,920
Okay, when he throws the shit, I got at least two hits there. I can do it. Here comes. Get away

228
00:47:12,920 --> 00:48:09,449
from him. Oh baby. Oh baby. Come on. That's a grab. Uh oh. Bad. Bad. Bad. Very bad.

229
00:48:12,219 --> 00:48:19,539
Oh that's what? That's a grab too? I thought that was a sweep. Oh no. Oh no.

230
00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:30,099
That's, that sucks man. Like seriously. It's all right. That just wasted like three. That sucks.

231
00:48:31,219 --> 00:48:37,210
It's so hard to tell what the fuck he's gonna do. Yeah, this is a really good start too.

232
00:48:37,210 --> 00:49:04,940
That's unfortunate. I still can do it. Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle. Let's just get it. Let's get a

233
00:49:04,940 --> 00:49:52,219
short thing. Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, wiggle. All right. Let's go. Don't do it. Don't

234
00:49:52,219 --> 00:50:18,460
do it. I got, I got, I got it. This is it. This is it. It's done. Goodbye. Right in the heart.

235
00:50:31,719 --> 00:50:40,329
All right. Damn. That was fun though. Oh no. Of course not. Yeah. Welcome to From Software.

236
00:50:50,619 --> 00:50:58,019
Oh great. I got to learn a whole new fucking move set now. Well this is fucking fun.

237
00:50:58,820 --> 00:51:10,280
I don't even know what that is. I can't even scare him. What? Is that a jump? Um.

238
00:51:15,210 --> 00:51:31,940
Well this is interesting. I mean you spend the whole time trying to figure out. Now I

239
00:51:31,940 --> 00:51:59,449
got to fight another boss. Oh this is great. Oh no. Someone's rotting. Well this um. Hey is

240
00:51:59,449 --> 00:52:04,489
this a From Software game that was made after 2016? Every boss has two or three phases.

241
00:52:05,050 --> 00:52:25,659
I should be aware of that now. Fuck. Okay. I wonder what the tactic is after he's dead.

242
00:52:26,380 --> 00:53:39,820
You really can't take that much damage here then. What? Where are you going? Back up.

243
00:53:39,820 --> 00:53:46,579
Oh god. Not the camera. Not the camera. Not the camera. Just use one of these now.

244
00:54:00,889 --> 00:54:56,230
Damn it. No. That's bad. Not that bad though. The wiggle. Asshole. Come on. He's gonna throw.

245
00:55:28,710 --> 00:55:33,659
You gotta be fucking kidding me. That was absolute dog shit. Like give me a break.

246
00:55:34,219 --> 00:55:43,030
Are you serious? Really? Dodge grabs. Except when you can't. I did that. I timed that so

247
00:55:43,030 --> 00:56:09,340
perfectly. I did. Give me a break. Now he's doing this every single time. His fucking move

248
00:56:09,340 --> 00:56:45,130
set changed since the last time I fought him. I'm not locked on anymore for some reason. Why?

249
00:56:51,659 --> 00:56:55,739
I'm gonna get the fuck away. You know what I mean? Like there's no reason to do that.

250
00:57:03,639 --> 00:57:27,610
Fucking Jesus. How are you supposed to beat this second phase? Why? Can you do it? Why is

251
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:48,539
that not hitting him? What the fuck? Give me a break. What? I feel like I'm gonna be here

252
00:57:48,539 --> 00:58:32,170
for a while. I'm trying to figure out if his ass is more horrible or his head.

253
00:58:32,170 --> 00:59:01,380
I've been hitting his ass. He can stagger a little bit in the head. It seems his head is

254
00:59:01,380 --> 00:59:39,579
staggered. Not so much his ass. Dodge frames. I can't. No. God damn it. I might stop drinking.

255
00:59:40,460 --> 01:00:09,559
I'm still alive. This is insane. The fact that you gotta do this twice with a move

256
01:00:09,559 --> 01:00:13,320
set I've only seen one time. I'll be here for the next three straight days.

257
01:00:14,119 --> 01:00:39,750
What the hell happened there? You gotta get the free tap there. You have to on his head. You can

258
01:00:39,750 --> 01:01:10,170
get it. That's what I'm doing. I'm trying to jump fast enough. No. I think it was just so

259
01:01:10,170 --> 01:01:14,329
debilitating seeing that I had to fight. I like drained a bunch of energy and now I gotta

260
01:01:14,329 --> 01:01:25,800
fight this. Oh fuck me. This is gonna be horrible. Whatever. I'll do it. Let me put

261
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:41,179
it on. Let me go into my inventory because I feel like this shit is worthless. So maybe like

262
01:01:42,340 --> 01:01:56,789
fire the axe maybe? I wonder. When he goes down try to get a hit on his ass or his face maybe.

263
01:01:57,429 --> 01:02:02,550
I could try to poison him too. We'll see. We'll try the fire.

264
01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:39,320
Wait for the first wiggle and see what happens. The worst part about that is I can't do the

265
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:53,079
follow-up. He's apparently too big. Burning? How long is he on fire for? That's actually not too

266
01:02:53,079 --> 01:03:00,489
bad. It really isn't. Just gotta hit it like a couple times after he just wiggle wiggle.

267
01:03:01,130 --> 01:03:32,260
Like here. Ready? Then get it. There it is. Now that's it. It's actually very effective.

268
01:03:32,820 --> 01:03:50,570
I gotta get out of the corner man. The camera's gonna possibly... I gotta stop

269
01:03:50,570 --> 01:04:20,199
dodging that. It's impossible to dodge it. I have to walk into the jump. Come on. Let me

270
01:04:20,199 --> 01:04:56,570
see it again. Like even me. Like really? Why is this still a problem?

271
01:05:01,610 --> 01:05:30,579
Why does it have to still be an issue? Like after 15 years? Still. He's gonna throw shit.

272
01:05:31,699 --> 01:06:04,090
Alright guys. We get to see the second phase again. Are you ready? I'm excited.

273
01:06:04,969 --> 01:06:16,070
Can I still hurt him? Come on let me do like damage to him now.

274
01:06:16,789 --> 01:06:53,429
I don't... Oh fuck. How do I get rid of terror? I'm gonna use that but hold on. What's the terror

275
01:06:53,429 --> 01:07:14,980
one? This one right? Oh man. I don't know what the fuck he's doing. It was a sweep.

276
01:07:15,780 --> 01:07:57,340
I don't fucking get it. I don't... I'm gonna try again. Man it's so awkward. Jesus.

277
01:07:58,219 --> 01:08:14,969
What am I doing? What? That takes so long. That takes forever. That takes forever.

278
01:08:15,929 --> 01:08:21,930
Why would you ever have that? That... oh I'm gonna do a little stance now and pray.

279
01:08:22,890 --> 01:08:43,899
I don't have any healing. This is fucking insane. Holy shit. It's just... it's fighting just

280
01:08:43,899 --> 01:08:47,659
two bosses back to back that are not completely different from each other.

281
01:08:48,460 --> 01:08:54,729
You gotta fight the the ape and then you gotta fight the headless horseman with a sword.

282
01:08:57,479 --> 01:09:05,590
My goodness this is fucking crazy. They're not fucking around. It took until like the Dark Souls

283
01:09:05,590 --> 01:09:18,890
3 DLC before you got a boss like this. All right let's see. Oil, fire. I feel like I should...

284
01:09:18,890 --> 01:09:26,220
I'm gonna like waste these here. This dude is a full-on wall. Uh well I need... I'm just gonna

285
01:09:26,220 --> 01:09:29,579
go in the inventory and take these because the game pauses and having too much shit on my

286
01:09:29,579 --> 01:09:54,420
bar always fucks me up. Let me see how this goes. Let me see how oil works on them.

287
01:09:55,140 --> 01:10:01,289
There are hooks all around for the scream. Yeah but it happens so quickly that it's almost difficult

288
01:10:01,289 --> 01:10:06,010
to kind of rip the camera and like find a tree. He knocks the trees down too doesn't he?

289
01:10:06,970 --> 01:10:10,899
Just kind of have to turn and just do it. Man. All right here we go.

290
01:10:11,779 --> 01:10:30,180
Fight over his head. Covered. Wiggle. I'm just gonna see if he's done anything.

291
01:10:31,220 --> 01:10:46,310
Okay he's only gonna do it once. He's covered in oil. One thing I don't know about oil,

292
01:10:46,310 --> 01:10:50,859
does oil have to be applied every time? Or is it just on him? That's unreliable.

293
01:10:52,619 --> 01:11:24,409
Nah that's very unreliable. You gotta get like the perfect opportunity. Don't do it.

294
01:11:24,409 --> 01:12:18,180
Oh that was enough. No don't do it. Is it enough? In the corner. Wiggle wiggle.

295
01:12:18,739 --> 01:12:31,859
Burn him. Oh right let me do it twice. Shit. Not good. Not good. Not good. Not good.

296
01:12:32,739 --> 01:13:07,770
All right here comes the shit. Missed. All right five heals. Let's go. Come on.

297
01:13:08,649 --> 01:13:15,859
Bring this fucking giant Donkey Kong asshole into the grave. All right here we go. Wait wait wait

298
01:13:15,859 --> 01:13:19,460
wait wait wait wait wait. Let's make this quick. Let's let's get some shit like okay done.

299
01:13:19,460 --> 01:13:26,579
Pacifying agent. And I think I'm gonna take like a cookie here. I don't know.

300
01:13:26,579 --> 01:13:31,939
I think I'm just gonna. How long do these last? Attack power. Vitality damage.

301
01:13:31,939 --> 01:13:51,640
What do these fucking things do? They last for like 15 seconds. It's not long enough.

302
01:13:53,779 --> 01:13:59,159
I'll wait till he gets up and I'm gonna do. Ah fuck. Shit.

303
01:14:01,159 --> 01:14:11,079
I gotta get a plan here. I'm gonna use a. Okay I don't know. I'm gonna use the.

304
01:14:11,079 --> 01:14:23,850
I'm just going in hard. You ready? No. Vitality damage. No. No take it off. Take.

305
01:14:24,489 --> 01:14:32,630
I'm already panicking. Okay I'm gonna take this one. This one. Attack sugar. Let's go.

306
01:14:33,510 --> 01:14:54,380
Here we go. Go. Mistake. Mistake. Mistakes. What the fuck is that move?

307
01:15:02,020 --> 01:15:13,399
What do I do? What do I do? Oh my god. I can't see the water is fucking me up.

308
01:15:14,279 --> 01:16:06,039
No. Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. All right. What happened? What the fuck is going on? I don't.

309
01:16:06,119 --> 01:17:21,579
Ah fuck. Jesus. No. No. There's no. That fucking camera man. You see what I'm talking about?

310
01:17:21,579 --> 01:17:27,750
Give me a break. That's so hard to do that. It's so difficult to find a little spot.

311
01:17:28,390 --> 01:17:43,800
It really is. It's fucking ridiculous. See? Like where the fuck can I even grab from here?

312
01:17:44,520 --> 01:17:52,220
I don't even want to get close to him. One more of those and I'm fucking dead.

313
01:17:53,020 --> 01:18:16,840
I'm gonna stay near like a tree. Get out. Get out. Get out. Get out.

314
01:18:52,680 --> 01:19:16,869
Fuck. Nah fuck. That was a different combo. Okay come on. I got this shit. Let's go. Oh no.

315
01:19:18,789 --> 01:19:44,180
Out. Out. Out. Out. Out. Out. Out. Out. Out. Out. Out. Out. Out. Out. Out. Out.

316
01:20:14,090 --> 01:20:32,710
Out. Out. Out. Out. Out. Out. Out. Oh shit. I don't know where to go.

317
01:20:33,350 --> 01:20:57,079
I have to take it. Damn it. This is insane. Oh no. This is so. I had it too. It's just so awkward.

318
01:20:57,079 --> 01:21:09,180
And I got no more pacifying agents. Oh my god. He's incredibly fucking difficult.

319
01:21:10,470 --> 01:21:18,260
God damn it. Oh I have no more. God damn it. You can hold run. I know it's just it's so.

320
01:21:18,260 --> 01:21:24,039
I just. It's it's real easy to say. Oh you can just do this. You can just do that.

321
01:21:24,039 --> 01:21:27,239
When you're in the fucking driver's seat. When you're in the. When you're piling the airplane.

322
01:21:27,960 --> 01:21:40,119
It's a lot harder. A lot easier said than done. Do this shit again. I feel like I was

323
01:21:40,119 --> 01:21:49,380
fighting him in that other phase for like fucking 45 minutes. Bad run already. Nah kill me. This

324
01:21:49,380 --> 01:22:12,659
is bad already. Just kill me. I had it too. So close. You just gotta. You gotta parry that

325
01:22:12,659 --> 01:22:18,739
string when he's in that second phase. Those weird awkward thrusting. And then he does the

326
01:22:18,739 --> 01:22:24,420
big one overhead. And then you get the free hits. But fuck man. You gotta do that so many times.

327
01:22:24,420 --> 01:22:33,319
I feel like I'm not even doing any damage to him. Out of pacifying agent. I'm gonna have to buy some.

328
01:22:39,770 --> 01:22:52,500
I really think I might have to start drinking. It'll like loosen me up a little I think.

329
01:22:53,060 --> 01:23:00,579
Because right now I'm like. I'm like fucking tilted right now. I'm not even angry. Just

330
01:23:00,579 --> 01:23:15,989
like fuck man. Everything's gonna be so perfect. Nah yeah. I don't know guys.

331
01:23:16,949 --> 01:23:21,670
I might have to take a second here. I've been here for like 45 straight minutes.

332
01:23:26,539 --> 01:23:45,960
I feel like I have to beat him here though. Man oh man. Man oh man. Man okay. I gotta just be

333
01:23:45,960 --> 01:23:59,130
clean. Alright if I die again I'm going. I'm popping the bottle of wine. And if I beat him

334
01:23:59,130 --> 01:24:12,409
I'm popping the bottle of wine anyway. For victory. Alright just be easy. Play it smart.

335
01:24:12,409 --> 01:24:43,779
I know all his moves at this point. And shake. You can hit him so many times with fire.

336
01:24:46,390 --> 01:25:07,659
What apparently. Every single one of them. Like somewhere underneath.

337
01:25:08,380 --> 01:25:36,680
Now hit him right like a sack. If I get there with at least like three or four.

338
01:25:37,720 --> 01:25:44,409
And I got like the dodge frame. Why even have a dodge? Why even tell me to dodge grabs when

339
01:25:44,409 --> 01:25:52,439
there's eye frames for dodging grabs is like there's none. Why even have that tutorial?

340
01:25:52,439 --> 01:26:17,020
We'll be here for the next six hours. I feel weak. I feel like I should be doing more damage

341
01:26:17,020 --> 01:26:22,380
to him or something. The second phase I was hitting so many times. I feel so fucking weak

342
01:26:22,380 --> 01:27:07,909
right now. Should take a minute. Should. I didn't. Fuck you. That like 180 degree

343
01:27:07,909 --> 01:27:21,210
insta turn into grab. I thought that leaf was a person. And I was like how did somebody get

344
01:27:21,210 --> 01:27:38,970
down here? I got one healing potion left. This is gonna be bad. I just gotta parry everything

345
01:27:38,970 --> 01:27:51,460
and then run away. No healing potions. No pacifying agents. Just parry everything and run.

346
01:27:52,819 --> 01:28:05,930
I'm gonna try. Sugar. Sugar doesn't seem to last long enough to. Alright here we go. Oh no

347
01:28:05,930 --> 01:28:10,489
I forgot. It's okay. I don't know why I didn't get hit by that. He stopped mid swinging. Did

348
01:28:10,489 --> 01:28:16,710
you see that? That was really weird. He was doing his like animation here and just decided

349
01:28:16,710 --> 01:28:52,869
to do something else. That's without the good view of that. It's hard dude. I gotta get out

350
01:28:52,869 --> 01:29:06,180
of here. What the hell was that? Here comes a big sweep. I'm so afraid of this terror thing

351
01:29:06,180 --> 01:29:13,930
at this point. I tried to hit. I tried to grapple it and you see how it happened.

352
01:29:13,930 --> 01:29:21,640
Thing in the top right. I was gonna do it. Just act out of frame. You can hear me pressing

353
01:29:21,640 --> 01:30:20,579
the buttons here. Trees down too. Oh I'm too scared to fucking do anything man.

354
01:30:21,619 --> 01:31:09,060
I'll do it. I don't care if it takes me 30 minutes. What? I don't know. Oh shit.

355
01:31:16,619 --> 01:31:51,930
Calm down. What the fuck. Okay that's it. It's all sweeps. If you missed the first one

356
01:31:51,930 --> 01:31:56,250
that's such a weird little place to go. He does a little turn and if he missed the first

357
01:31:56,250 --> 01:32:02,779
one you're fucked. You gotta be close before you get him. This just takes forever.

358
01:32:07,829 --> 01:32:33,430
You can do four. You can do four. That's a bad. That's a mistake. Don't do it like that.

359
01:32:34,069 --> 01:32:55,699
Coming up. Oh shit. Oh fuck. Whoa he stopped mid animation you asshole.

360
01:32:57,369 --> 01:33:17,939
What a dick. Fucker that was so ridiculous. Sometimes he changes that combo in the middle.

361
01:33:19,159 --> 01:33:21,800
I am gonna have to tell you guys something here right now okay.

362
01:33:22,680 --> 01:34:11,449
I'm ready to take this. I'm ready to take this. In fact I'm ready to take this. Bring it up.

363
01:34:19,939 --> 01:34:25,189
That's positioning. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck.

364
01:34:25,989 --> 01:35:35,350
Oh my god I fucked it up over here. It's time. It's time to take it. He doesn't.

365
01:36:07,140 --> 01:36:12,310
Kill him. Kill him please. Take the worm out.

366
01:36:12,949 --> 01:36:23,000
Don't get up again. He better not get up again. If he gets up again I'm quitting the game.

367
01:36:23,640 --> 01:36:33,819
I heard the scream. Oh my god that was fucking ridiculous.

368
01:36:34,619 --> 01:36:38,539
When they throw the second phase shit at you. You just. You gotta redo the whole. You gotta

369
01:36:38,539 --> 01:36:51,100
relearn the whole fight twice. Hey I told you. Win or lose. How many attempts was that? That

370
01:36:51,100 --> 01:37:05,659
was a lot of attempts. Slender finger. Empty the cupboards. It's time for a glass of wine.

371
01:37:07,479 --> 01:37:11,560
So the slender finger of a young woman can be fitted to the prosthetic to create a prosthetic

372
01:37:11,560 --> 01:37:18,760
tool. Found in the belly of the guardian ape it is partially digested. There's a shinobi

373
01:37:18,760 --> 01:37:25,130
technique called the finger whistle that can drive beasts wild. The one he used it before

374
01:37:25,130 --> 01:37:31,859
clearly used it for this purpose as evidenced by the finger's open hole. And let's read the.

375
01:37:31,859 --> 01:37:41,270
Okay now I can do what I wanted to do. Oh man that shit is fucking. That's fucking crazy.

376
01:37:41,989 --> 01:37:54,279
I want to read the uh thing that I just got. Where is it? There it is. The battle memory of

377
01:37:54,279 --> 01:37:59,619
an extraordinary foe lingering in the mind of the wolf. Commune to the sculptors and confront

378
01:37:59,619 --> 01:38:02,659
memories of battle to permanently increase attack power. The guardian ape was defeated

379
01:38:02,659 --> 01:38:07,380
though its roar can still be heard. It is said that an infested body marks the undying.

380
01:38:09,939 --> 01:38:25,619
Oh boy. Enhance attack power. Let's go. But such a long life would surely be quite

381
01:38:25,619 --> 01:38:29,460
lonesome for even an ape. Perhaps the echoing roar of the guardian ape was in fact

382
01:38:29,460 --> 01:38:43,670
a solicitation of sorts. Sweat check? I'm not wearing any clothes. I'll put a t-shirt on and

383
01:38:43,670 --> 01:38:47,510
I'll get the bottle of wine though. I don't even. Do I have a blind opener? I don't think

384
01:38:47,510 --> 01:38:58,470
I even do. I've not had a blind opener since moving to this place. All right there it is

385
01:38:58,470 --> 01:39:14,020
finally. Recovers vitality upon performing a successful death blow. Uh yeah now we're in

386
01:39:14,020 --> 01:39:24,979
business. I still do want this and I got these two. I think I want these as well.

387
01:39:25,779 --> 01:39:33,659
Your face can't be on the entire time. All right hold on. I'll be right back.

388
01:39:33,659 --> 01:43:15,210
Let me let me go see how hard this is going to be to do. Honest to god

389
01:43:15,210 --> 01:43:20,090
I will never understand why I am the way that I am. You know I sometimes just think

390
01:43:20,090 --> 01:43:26,329
about that. There are like four bottles of wine in this house. There's no way to open them.

391
01:43:27,500 --> 01:43:34,680
I just keep adding to my collection. Oh that sounds good. They've corked. I can't open them.

392
01:43:34,680 --> 01:43:45,770
I never get a wine opener. I just keep adding to my pantry of wines. I can't you can't use a

393
01:43:45,770 --> 01:43:51,460
knife. I'll be able to fuck it up. But it's all right. We'll do the next best thing.

394
01:43:51,460 --> 01:43:59,020
That's a cider. So here we go. Cheers everybody. Turn on the camera like 30 seconds.

395
01:43:59,100 --> 01:44:17,079
But cameras aren't plugged. Who did this? I didn't do this.

396
01:44:17,079 --> 01:44:31,220
Somebody came in here and did this. I didn't do it. Is this it?

397
01:44:40,699 --> 01:44:48,460
What where did this magically disappear? Where's the USB plug for this? What the what?

398
01:44:50,260 --> 01:45:08,630
It's just gone. I don't ever have a computer. Ever. Only read newspapers,

399
01:45:08,630 --> 01:45:34,039
do crosswords, and use your phone. All right here we go. Hi guys. Cheers everybody.

400
01:45:34,039 --> 01:45:51,000
This is cider. Ew. That was fucking insane. This game's crazy. Drinking at four o'clock

401
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:55,319
in the afternoon. It's five o'clock in the afternoon. Therefore it's legal. It's legal

402
01:45:55,319 --> 01:46:09,289
now. I can do it now. I need a minute after that. I need to go on like a light jog

403
01:46:09,289 --> 01:46:14,390
after that one. What's wrong with your sideburns? They're always fucked up. I have

404
01:46:14,390 --> 01:46:27,899
like a misshapen face. So they're never gonna be correct. Sorry. It's pretty good. No wine

405
01:46:27,899 --> 01:46:42,069
though. I can't have I can't have wine. I look lovely. Thank you. What's going on here?

406
01:46:42,789 --> 01:46:50,090
What's going on here? Okay I thought hair just fell out but it was actually on the screen.

407
01:46:50,090 --> 01:46:54,699
Why don't you do face cam? Always have face cam on. Dude you'll get like more viewers.

408
01:47:02,359 --> 01:47:29,300
That's why we turned it off. All right back to the game. So who's my favorite boss so

409
01:47:29,300 --> 01:47:34,220
far? Uh for those of you that have gotten this far and played this far probably uh

410
01:47:34,220 --> 01:47:41,859
Genichiro. That one felt the most uh I felt that that one was the most involved for me.

411
01:47:42,579 --> 01:47:53,060
A giant gorilla throwing shit at you and I mean this was cool. All right I'm thinking

412
01:47:53,060 --> 01:48:03,659
ready. Typical typical Saul's camera right guys? Oh look at that. Sorry. Complain,

413
01:48:03,659 --> 01:48:06,380
complain, complain. All right can I ask you guys how many of you guys have watched

414
01:48:07,180 --> 01:48:18,069
other streamers play uh this game? Maybe a bunch of you? What what's percentage wise? Okay let's say

415
01:48:18,069 --> 01:48:23,699
well not percentage but where do I fit in like the streamer complains about the video game

416
01:48:23,699 --> 01:48:29,220
and is like angry at the video game? Where do I sit there? You know let's say one is

417
01:48:29,779 --> 01:48:34,819
streamer didn't do it at all and ten is streamer is so obnoxious with how much they're

418
01:48:34,819 --> 01:48:40,539
talking about how the game's not good and how it's the game is hard and it's too hard

419
01:48:41,100 --> 01:48:45,260
and I hate this game it's stupid the mechanics are dumb. Like where do I sit there?

420
01:48:50,760 --> 01:48:57,579
The four? About a four? All right I'm all right with the four.

421
01:49:03,460 --> 01:49:09,779
Keep me honest though if I get over a five if we get to like six territory you guys got to

422
01:49:09,779 --> 01:49:17,850
let me know. I don't want I don't want to get to six territory. Get it off the screen!

423
01:49:23,899 --> 01:49:27,819
All right a white lotus flower found blooming in the depths of the sunken valley where

424
01:49:27,819 --> 01:49:31,819
the fountain had waters pooled deeply. The flower's aroma attracts female apes.

425
01:49:32,380 --> 01:49:36,300
Thus the guardian ape carefully tended it to it so as to offer it to his bride.

426
01:49:37,270 --> 01:49:41,189
One of the incense ingredients sought by the divine air for immortal separates. That's kind

427
01:49:41,189 --> 01:49:51,720
of sad. Well I have the lotus. I can now go talk to the kid and we can continue to progress.

428
01:49:52,439 --> 01:50:01,189
Nothing up there right? How could you? Well I needed his soul. I needed increased attack power.

429
01:50:01,829 --> 01:50:05,699
Look he is he was like suffering down here for like 4 000 years.

430
01:50:07,289 --> 01:50:10,649
But wait don't ever just leave an area without checking.

431
01:50:11,289 --> 01:50:28,470
You know there could be something over here. Nothing? Really?

432
01:50:34,859 --> 01:50:55,109
What's wrong with some of you guys? Um let's just go back. Jerma lied about Minecraft VR.

433
01:50:56,470 --> 01:51:11,220
Thank you for the five community subs. Again thank you. Coming in with the five subs.

434
01:51:11,220 --> 01:51:16,170
All right so I got the flower now. I have to go put the flower.

435
01:51:18,520 --> 01:51:22,760
Talk to the kid. He's in the library right? Is he still in here? I got the flower!

436
01:51:23,479 --> 01:51:35,510
I procured the flower for the was it truly blooming in the sunken valley yeah deep within the

437
01:51:35,510 --> 01:51:42,069
valley so that is where the fountain had waters pulled deeply he's done well to acquire this

438
01:51:42,069 --> 01:51:49,449
wolf oh and actually i found something i discovered there's another scent we need another one what

439
01:51:49,449 --> 01:51:56,170
is it the blood of the divine air of the dragon's heritage in other words my blood

440
01:51:57,609 --> 01:51:58,649
what i gotta kill him

441
01:52:03,109 --> 01:52:06,680
whoa i just like fucking went down in my seat however

442
01:52:06,680 --> 01:52:13,460
in the world can you walk this thing i found a curious journal belonging to lord tecaru's page

443
01:52:13,460 --> 01:52:19,939
and it appears there is a way for me to bleed for now i'd like to ask you to keep this for me

444
01:52:19,939 --> 01:52:25,939
here we go page's diary an old diary entry written by tecaru's page lord tecaro held his

445
01:52:25,939 --> 01:52:31,619
arm over the incense burner and attempted to cut it with a sword but incredibly his wound healed

446
01:52:31,619 --> 01:52:38,600
instantly and not a drop of blood was shed lady tomo said without it your blood cannot be spilled

447
01:52:38,600 --> 01:52:44,359
what could she be referring to i wonder now then we just need to figure out how to make

448
01:52:44,359 --> 01:52:51,479
me bleed perhaps we should ask lady emma let me ask you this she should have much knowledge

449
01:52:51,479 --> 01:53:09,800
do you bleed let me ask you this do you believe let me ask you this superman do you believe i gotta

450
01:53:09,800 --> 01:53:29,340
get it right let me ask you something superman do you believe perfect emma emma emma there is

451
01:53:30,220 --> 01:53:34,779
i'm reaching a six at last like what the sakura tree behind the castle

452
01:53:37,100 --> 01:53:43,659
it is a sakura tree that lord tecaru brought from his homeland so it's a sakura tree from

453
01:53:43,659 --> 01:53:51,500
the divine realm yes it's quite a mysterious one is that it was constantly in bloom even

454
01:53:51,500 --> 01:54:02,729
outside of spring poison swamp town oh i can't wait why there was a person who cut off branch

455
01:54:02,810 --> 01:54:19,210
and took flowers from he stole it without the everblossom there oh i have the monkey drink

456
01:54:19,210 --> 01:54:31,590
right there was a dragon rod epidemic in ashina what every single person i see it was the title

457
01:54:31,590 --> 01:54:43,770
of the stream i don't remember what it was i can't see it from here has alleviated this regret

458
01:54:43,770 --> 01:54:53,880
oh right right right i mean that's kind of true all right so we're going to poison swamp

459
01:54:54,899 --> 01:55:07,960
can't wait anything else i can do what do i have for uh lady emma about the sakura tree what

460
01:55:07,960 --> 01:55:14,579
she said the tree is called an everblossom lord tecaru brought it here from the divine realm

461
01:55:14,579 --> 01:55:19,779
but it has withered away i wonder if i should give the prosthetic guy the monkey booze however

462
01:55:19,779 --> 01:55:26,550
it is said that someone plucked a branch from the everblossom and stole off with it who would

463
01:55:26,550 --> 01:55:33,989
do such a thing some fucking loser what's lost is lost finding a stolen tree branch

464
01:55:34,710 --> 01:55:41,350
we have no information to go on let us gather what we can for the aroma first as you wish

465
01:55:41,350 --> 01:55:52,229
nice whatever you fucking lose oh why doesn't the souls team make like a boston guy for like

466

500
02:03:43,619 --> 02:03:49,529
saw me play through that any item that looks even remotely useful i can't use it because

501
02:03:49,529 --> 02:04:02,060
it's so useful that i don't want it to use i don't want to use it it's too useful okay so

502
02:04:02,859 --> 02:04:16,220
where do i go from here this way i guess we're gonna wrap around here it's not useful when you

02:04:16,220 --> 02:04:20,779
don't do anything when it does nothing i know it's bad i agree with you completely

uh yellow gunpowder that i got green mossy gourd refills upon rest

508
02:05:33,449 --> 02:05:38,170
it doesn't heal poison status it reduces poison build-up and increases poison resistance

509
02:05:38,729 --> 02:05:45,659
another gourd huh how much money do i have i have one dollar

552
02:18:05,190 --> 02:18:13,620
maybe there'd be a way to go down here i don't think there's any other way to go

553
02:18:19,559 --> 02:18:28,040
no snake it is apparently or did i open i don't think i opened up in the area after the gorilla

561
02:20:25,139 --> 02:20:29,860
whistle's location by locking onto a target only the targeted enemy will hear the whistle

562

665
02:45:38,579 --> 02:45:54,500
missing because i can't go from here to there there was a wall behind the mini boss yeah but

666
02:45:54,500 --> 02:46:01,180
it looked like it was a little too high for me to get over there am i crazy i guess not okay

667
02:46:01,819 --> 02:46:12,440
i thought there was a wall to try to jump up okay well uh this definitely leads to

668
02:46:12,440 --> 02:46:26,360
around the corner holy shit comedy chat man i gave another 50 dollars what if i said i won

669

this with max bet uh look so that hey that's on you to decide i'm not gonna tell you not

02:46:38,760 --> 02:46:52,299
to max bet nonetheless that's still that's another 50 dollars oh jesus is that another

672
02:46:59,420 --> 02:47:09,180
does this one have a headless horseman thing no way do you have to do this again

673
02:47:09,180 --> 02:47:15,750
i refuse to believe that no way uh-uh uh-uh that's not true you know i don't have to do

674
02:47:15,750 --> 02:47:24,120
this they're not going to play that same card twice why would they do that that it

675
02:47:24,120 --> 02:47:41,780
makes no sense i just need to prove to myself this is like a scripted moment i'm not gonna

676
02:47:41,780 --> 02:47:44,500
jump down here and like the snake's gonna eat them or something or they're gonna get a fight

677
02:47:44,500 --> 02:48:02,520
it's gonna be like the t-rex versus velociraptors where's my idol from here nice what did it what

678
02:48:02,520 --> 02:48:05,000
i don't they both look exactly the same i don't know which way is the right way

679
02:48:08,180 --> 02:48:27,270
of course god damn it why okay so this is i let me just see what's this is that's not

680
02:48:27,270 --> 02:48:54,889
the way to go guy with one of the guns did this to you um really both there's no escape

681
02:48:56,040 --> 02:49:02,700
i'm getting telltale aped right now okay well um knowing that that's over here

682
02:49:12,950 --> 02:49:23,129
i'm gonna go heal at the where's the nearest one probably this one's the best one to do

683
02:49:23,770 --> 02:49:28,600
because you can just jump and run straight right i would assume this is probably the better one to

684
02:49:28,600 --> 02:49:49,930
do because it is just just jump off because this is holy shit more money another 50 bucks

712
02:59:14,020 --> 02:59:19,219
idol and confront memories of battle to permanently increase tack power good colossal beast plague

physical attributes vitality and posture have increased and here it is headless ape at one

718
03:01:02,870 --> 03:01:06,389
time the guardian ape shared its den with a mate but he alone became infested with while

719
03:01:06,389 --> 03:01:11,030
the other passed away even the flowers offered in tribute to her passing have withered to dust

720
03:01:11,989 --> 03:01:22,340
so this thing is going to be like mr rex well at least i got points for it uh we had huge bits

comedy chapman and my bank just texted me asking if this was fraudulent uh you probably

723
03:01:36,420 --> 03:01:42,899

725
03:01:56,790 --> 03:02:19,500
feeling you'll be back why don't just just just cut this thing in half whatever it's undying

726
03:02:21,270 --> 03:02:33,340
i got it i got the ape let me see was there a way i could go from here can i go up that

727
03:02:33,340 --> 03:02:53,059

729
03:03:24,409 --> 03:03:40,280
she's gone but she was here just moments ago shinobi listen i finally saw her the shamisen

730
03:03:40,280 --> 03:03:53,239
player was a woman i only saw her from afar i tell fleeting presence oh i should have asked

731
03:03:53,239 --> 03:04:02,299
if she was calling to me before i knew it disappeared this guy's kind of going crazy huh

732
03:04:03,670 --> 03:04:13,180
now that i think it over my father told me stories about a hidden town shrouded deeply don't

733
03:04:13,180 --> 03:04:24,809
ever go there he said but now misty forest if only i could figure out how to get through it

734
03:04:24,809 --> 03:04:32,069
and find that shamisen player it's coming from deep in the fog i don't know shit apparently

735
03:04:32,069 --> 03:04:46,489
that melody is calling me apparently i just don't know shit if only i okay uh nice knowing you

738
03:05:29,079 --> 03:05:45,610
that often though it does it twice this is the night jaw slash i mean i am so far down this

739
03:05:45,610 --> 03:05:52,170
tree that i might as well just do it let's do it so this is a double and this is the cross

740
03:05:52,809 --> 03:05:59,129
it covers posture upon executing a successful death blow that's really good

741
03:05:59,770 --> 03:06:26,260
that'll be helpful in some boss fights maybe not um probably this then or i'll hold on to

742
03:06:26,260 --> 03:06:36,870
it all right what about my skills here is it already equipped double let's see here

743
03:06:44,649 --> 03:06:57,559
adds a follow-up attack so wait hold on so oh wow so i can just do it twice

744
03:06:58,520 --> 03:07:12,889
your posture that way all right cool what's this uh is breadcrumbs for me to find my way around

745
03:07:16,379 --> 03:07:38,420

923
04:02:22,090 --> 04:02:37,750
i gotta pick a tree just go i did get the flame thing right i'm going for it let's go flame

924
04:02:37,750 --> 04:02:53,750
vent then we can go through to loaded umbrella magnet when spread open it will protect against

925
04:02:53,750 --> 04:02:58,629
attacks from all directions hold it out while moving to protect from light attacks as a

926
04:02:58,709 --> 04:03:03,750
tempered magnetic shaft that makes it nearly unbreakable enemy attack can be deflected by

927
04:03:03,750 --> 04:03:15,059
spinning the open umbrella all right well here's the fucking super one if it's a short range flame

928
04:03:15,059 --> 04:03:18,819
blast continuous fire damage will inflict the burn status it is able to maintain a continuous

929
04:03:18,819 --> 04:03:24,620
stream of flames due to the smoldering resonance side of the tube mechanism so i

930
04:03:24,620 --> 04:03:30,549
just need money and then a few more well let's see yeah i need money and then a few more

931
04:03:30,549 --> 04:03:48,379
those so i got a better flame vent i just need money that seems stupid how much money do i have

932
04:03:55,129 --> 04:04:13,100
i got money i've got some money how much is it 500 okay it's 600 so that brings this

933
04:04:13,100 --> 04:04:21,899
is the better umbrella that we got the flame vent which goes to golden vortex

934
04:04:22,540 --> 04:04:40,680
jesus what do you mean na math it's 600 i'm talking about so i need three more black gun powder

935
04:04:40,680 --> 04:04:47,639
and then look at this shit golden vortex a large and with a golden fan gather illustrious

936
04:04:47,639 --> 04:04:51,319
golden wind and release it to force enemies caught in the vortex to face the other way

937
04:04:52,120 --> 04:04:57,989
can be performed twice in a row enemies that have been turned around drop items or money

938
04:04:57,989 --> 04:05:05,340
considered to be donations and this is the new umbrella when spread open it will protect

939
04:05:05,340 --> 04:05:10,860
against attacks from all directions the blessing of the vermilion bird prevents damage from fire

940
04:05:10,860 --> 04:05:18,739
and also prevents burn sounds kind of good all right so i need some more black gun powder

941
04:05:18,739 --> 04:05:28,389
i got you want some monkey booze i got it here i brought something for you monkey booze is it

04:05:40,219 --> 04:05:46,860
i trained in the techniques of the shinobi in the valley where the monkeys dwelled by yourself

944
04:05:46,860 --> 04:05:53,020
no there were two of us we were rogue shinobi there was no proper master for the likes of us

945
04:05:53,020 --> 04:05:59,819
that's why we went to the valley to run to jump to clash swords where one slip would mean

946
04:05:59,819 --> 04:06:06,139
your doom that was how we trained we came to move exactly as monkeys did after a time

947
04:06:06,139 --> 04:06:13,479

1046
04:29:42,870 --> 04:30:01,350
okay so now i guess we're just gonna go across the bridge and see what's on the other side

1047
04:30:02,069 --> 04:30:25,159
i got a checkpoint right there okay nothing over there how do i rate the game so far on a

1048
04:30:25,159 --> 04:30:40,329
scale of one to ten hmm that's tricky hmm uh it might be like a seven maybe like a six point four

1049
04:30:53,260 --> 04:30:58,309
no i'll be honest with you i'll be completely honest i'm not gonna pretend to be like nine

1050
04:30:58,309 --> 04:31:10,729
eight i think this is like an eight four right now i think it's an eight four at the moment

1051
04:31:11,290 --> 04:31:24,950
the swamp brought it down to a 70 because it was like a 90 i told you if there's if

1052
04:31:24,950 --> 04:31:27,989
there was a swamp in the game i was gonna give it a minus two letter grades and i did

1053
04:31:30,629 --> 04:31:40,329
none of these people are even worth my time so sneak over this way uh it is since from it from

1054
04:31:40,329 --> 04:31:48,020
the two letter grades come up to about an 84 we'll see how the game continues oh shit can i

1055
04:31:48,020 --> 04:32:09,290
get in here oh i'm just looking for like a i'm just looking for a way to get that item

over here i want that item oh fuck it whatever you know i'm gonna have to get everything in

1060
04:33:05,419 --> 04:33:34,310
the game i could probably wrap around there anyways this is there's something here there

1061
04:33:34,310 --> 04:33:54,860
okay um hi your illusion cannot what about those hold on wait just a minute wait wait wait wait

1062
04:33:54,860 --> 04:34:06,250
that's a sweep hold on what about these oops he looks like a loot he looks like an illusion

1063
04:34:06,250 --> 04:34:22,119
let me just see what happens here oh okay that's not a terrible thing to do

1064
04:34:25,659 --> 04:34:42,889
not a terrible loot set so far he's doing a lot how do you fireworks how you doing

1065
04:34:42,889 --> 04:34:48,580
how do you fireworks fireworks is as effective as the snappy things oops i didn't block that

1066
04:34:59,049 --> 04:35:16,970
that's a thrust different fucking different moves okay what's this what's the hand mean

1067
04:35:16,970 --> 04:35:49,130
i blocked it now that was a sweep oh shit fuck you don't have very much time at all damn it

1068
04:35:49,130 --> 04:36:14,729
that's hard to read not terrible though i got a feeling this is going to be phase one

1069
04:36:30,009 --> 04:36:42,810
shit that was a sweep that was shit okay i gotta i gotta get that down

1070
04:36:44,569 --> 04:37:10,180
fuck you that's just you got too many movesets man what a fantastic camera you have in this

1071
04:37:10,180 --> 04:37:15,939
video game it's like the best it's it's the best camera i've ever seen but the best i've

1072
04:37:15,939 --> 04:37:50,409
ever used better than mario 64 i'll tell you comparing them all too how many pellets i think i

1073
04:37:50,409 --> 04:38:39,159
do damn what's phase two let's see it i can bait it here okay corrupted monk watched over the cave

1074
04:38:39,159 --> 04:38:51,130
entrance breathing technique allows one to dive underwater as well as breathe underwater indefinitely

1075
04:38:51,770 --> 04:39:19,110
oh man i can dive underwater good night oh best camera i've ever seen in my life that's true

1076
04:39:19,110 --> 04:39:27,049
though come on give me a break it just went like right into his pelvis for five straight

1077
04:39:27,049 --> 04:39:45,590
seconds so that means every pool of water can now be oh man don't do this to me now i gotta

1078
04:39:45,590 --> 04:39:56,659
go check every pool of water camera's not that bad no it's not but in a game like this that

1079
04:39:56,659 --> 04:40:04,790
requires such pinpoint focus something like that can ruin an attempt like the camera going

1080
04:40:04,790 --> 04:40:10,169
like like zooming straight into the front of your face and you can't see the animations

1081
04:40:10,169 --> 04:40:13,900
they're doing you could that could ruin an entire attempt and then i would just complain

1082
04:40:13,900 --> 04:40:26,040
about it and i blame the camera good thing i didn't have to do that how would you have the

1083
04:40:26,040 --> 04:40:32,279
camera behind you in a corner spin around and show it from bird's eye serious have it come up

1084
04:40:32,279 --> 04:40:39,270
and have it be a bird's eye like isometric camera for like two seconds and spin in circles

1085
04:40:47,220 --> 04:40:54,330
i'm fucking kidding it's hard to do that it's you have a game engine right that's not easy

1086
04:40:54,330 --> 04:40:58,759
to do i don't know it isn't that doesn't mean i'm not going to complain about it

1087
04:40:58,759 --> 04:41:12,229
sometimes make the obstacles transparent has been a staple for years yeah i mean i guess you

1088
04:41:12,229 --> 04:41:17,509
could do a thing where like for instance like this if when the camera the camera could essentially

1089
04:41:17,509 --> 04:41:23,180
just i don't know how you would do it but because this sucks right it's too close and

1090
04:41:23,180 --> 04:41:25,900
if the guy's in front of me he's taking up the whole screen and it's like oh shit

1091
04:41:27,659 --> 04:41:43,130
so i'm gonna figure it out in like 100 years anyways that's fun that was a really

1092
04:41:43,130 --> 04:41:48,069
fun fight it was just you just that was all about this timing the parries and the sweeps

1093
04:41:48,790 --> 04:41:56,569
they had a couple that was a couple of fun fights in a row all right we've gone for it's

1094
04:41:56,569 --> 04:42:13,959
like an 86 now it's the flower in here what's it like being a las vegan i don't know what that

1095
04:42:13,959 --> 04:42:30,919
means is this another boss there it is a stone found in an altar deep within the village

1096
04:42:30,919 --> 04:42:34,279
of the water dwellers stones will sometimes appear in the bodies of those who have long

1097
04:42:34,279 --> 04:42:40,759
drank from the waters step into the marital stone and offer the fragment as versus stone

1098
04:42:40,759 --> 04:42:53,060
one of the incense ingredients stopped by the divine air for immortal severance so i have the

1099
04:42:53,060 --> 04:43:04,409
other ingredient what happened in here i like this area i'm supposed to i could have fought

1100
04:43:04,409 --> 04:43:29,860
that guy in here just checking just checking ape incoming yeah wouldn't that be something

1101
04:43:30,500 --> 04:43:34,119
if i had to fight the headless ape again all right i can just go back

1102
04:43:34,919 --> 04:43:59,209
because this is part of storyline quest item shit i think that's all i can do here something that

1103
04:43:59,209 --> 04:44:04,169
this game does that all the other ones that they've ever made don't do is a lot of the

1104
04:44:05,290 --> 04:44:10,810
mini boss mini boss boss they don't really give you any time at all all right what do you

1105
04:44:10,810 --> 04:44:36,680
think you got a second nope there's another fight i actually i like it though all right uh

1106
04:44:36,680 --> 04:45:11,990
this looks wrong wake him oh it's just you wolf i'm sorry i was asleep i got the other ingredient

1107
04:45:12,630 --> 04:45:18,150
look i found something that may help us it's a stone a stone i found that stone look at this

1108
04:45:19,430 --> 04:45:26,389
a fragrant stone enshrined in a village within the depths of the chino one must throw oneself

1109
04:45:26,389 --> 04:45:30,229
forward to be found with this the found head fragrance is complete let us depart now to

1110
04:45:30,229 --> 04:45:40,490
the divine realm what is that strangely shaped rock you got it right now the fragrant

1111
04:45:40,490 --> 04:45:47,930
stone of the fountain head my lord this stone appeared to have been enshrined yes it is just

1112
04:45:47,930 --> 04:45:55,299
as the book described yes there was also an inscription a sweetly scented bridal offering

1113
04:45:55,299 --> 04:46:01,639
written on the altar bridal what sort of place was this it was in a cave

1114
04:46:03,080 --> 04:46:08,360
fucking dump that's all i remember in that case where was the wedding procession headed

1115
04:46:08,360 --> 04:46:16,860

1337
05:59:51,540 --> 06:00:32,759
monkeys panels is empty it's dunston a five-pronged bell made of h bronze can be used repeatedly

1338
06:00:33,720 --> 06:00:39,979
when rung monkeys and wolves alike are returned to their initial states however a monkey caught

1339
06:00:39,979 --> 06:00:49,990
on the folding screen will not escape whether the bell is rung or not folding screen monkeys

1340
06:00:51,369 --> 06:01:38,200
folding screen monkeys uh where where what is it did do i just have it and i just have to

1341
06:01:38,200 --> 06:01:47,459
ring the bell near things or something elusive hall bell okay so then let me put it down here

1342
06:01:48,180 --> 06:01:57,909
monkeys and wolves are like a return to their initial states however a monkey caught in

1343
06:01:57,909 --> 06:02:18,310
the folding screen will not escape okay i yet another i believe you are on a mission

1344
06:02:18,869 --> 06:02:25,939
you wish to leave this place yes then you must defeat the monkeys depicted on the panels at

1345
06:02:25,939 --> 06:02:32,220
the whole entrance once you have done so the divine child's voice

1346
06:02:35,799 --> 06:02:45,900
the monkey purple kimono is the seeing monkey he has excellent eyesight can see great distances

1347
06:02:46,779 --> 06:02:55,830
and is very attentive if he spots you he will rock this exceedingly purple one

1348
06:02:56,389 --> 06:02:59,509
this runs and can see from a great distance over the orange one

1349
06:03:03,240 --> 06:03:08,840
while he does not have particularly good eyesight or hearing he makes a big fuss when

1350
06:03:08,840 --> 06:03:17,110
he sees a threat causing all the other monkeys to run oh perhaps he merely enjoys toying with

1351
06:03:17,990 --> 06:03:19,830
so kill orange one first

1352
06:03:24,340 --> 06:03:29,459
he has excellent hearing can hear across great distance hearing

1353
06:03:32,520 --> 06:03:34,439
he will generally run away

1354
06:03:37,299 --> 06:03:40,180
making it hard he is exceedingly

1355
06:03:41,139 --> 06:03:50,020
i do not wish to be it is usually quiet here which means it is near to nirvana in its own way

1356
06:03:50,970 --> 06:04:00,060
at least that is how it feels to me oh yes there was once someone who like you

1357
06:04:00,860 --> 06:04:11,290
a mission i believe he chased the monkeys for a while but everything here i pray that you

1358
06:04:11,369 --> 06:04:37,860
succeed uh okay okay okay there's the orange one orange and green do i do have to kill them

1359
06:04:37,860 --> 06:05:26,540
or do i need to just ring the bell near them uh well i'm gonna is he above me well there's

1360
06:05:26,540 --> 06:05:32,060
a bell here this is read this bell is deafening ringing it recklessly will also make your ears

1361
06:05:32,060 --> 06:05:59,049
ring which is the one that had bad hearing what green what i need to like can i talk to him again

1362
06:05:59,049 --> 06:06:16,759
green was purple is seeing okay orange is speaking bad eyesight and hearing

1363
06:06:18,119 --> 06:06:22,599
so orange is seeing green is hearing so the green one you can fuck up with the audio

1364
06:06:23,159 --> 06:06:37,290
can hear a few ways all right so green audio wants someone i believe what does this mean

1365
06:06:40,860 --> 06:06:49,000
no one can hear anything else in here so i'm gonna lure somebody in here lure the green one

1366
06:06:49,000 --> 06:07:01,130
in here i don't know how anything else to read so there's the waterfall room there's the bell

1367
06:07:01,130 --> 06:07:11,139
and then there's whatever this is bear flame in the wind when it goes out the place becomes

1368
06:07:11,139 --> 06:07:39,619
dark uh so the seeing monkey has to be killed in here let's see so it's dark in here now orange

1369
06:07:39,619 --> 06:07:56,889
is what the hell does this say the bottom cannot be seen above his darkness nothing can be seen

1370
06:07:56,889 --> 06:08:37,099
so the seeing monkey can get like pushed in here well there's the green one where does it

1371
06:08:37,099 --> 06:08:57,459
go where's the bell i can hear the monkey chase like running around but it's still i

1399
06:27:12,439 --> 06:27:16,919

on behalf of its master interesting okay what is that go to the halls of illusion

1401

1402
06:27:52,950 --> 06:27:58,389
why do you seek this place i seek the mortal blade do you know of the blade that cannot be

1403
06:27:59,270 --> 06:28:06,470
yes it is so called for not one who has drawn it has ever survived yet you still wish to attempt

1404
06:28:06,470 --> 06:28:26,840
this this in this way this is not the same person never mind i do i see very well

1405
06:28:30,200 --> 06:28:40,119
you're gonna give me the sword if you are prepared you may gaze upon the blade

1406
06:28:40,919 --> 06:28:54,840
i got this at an auction six hundred and forty five dollars

1407
06:28:57,240 --> 06:29:23,830
why is it i wonder are they not i looked at the sword and they killed me how are you

1408

1409
06:29:45,080 --> 06:29:55,849
oh new sword capable of slaying the undying its crimson blade will take the life of any

1410
06:29:55,849 --> 06:30:00,650
who dares draw it without the power of resurrection one could not hope to wield this weapon

1411
06:30:00,650 --> 06:30:05,369
which allows one to defeat even infested beings long concealed within the i'm going

1412
06:30:05,369 --> 06:30:08,009
i'm going back and i'm gonna kill the fuck i'm gonna go kill that fucking ape

1413
06:30:10,900 --> 06:30:16,950
hopefully he's still there lying in the ground see you serve the divine

1414
06:30:17,029 --> 06:30:22,150
heir of the dragon's heritage yes why do you seek the mortal blade

1415
06:30:22,150 --> 06:30:27,909
i wish to obtain the dragon tears from the divine realm to sever the ties of immortality

1416
06:30:27,909 --> 06:30:34,470
i see i have read about this i have read there is a way to sever the dragon's heritage

1417
06:30:36,939 --> 06:30:43,180
which means the divine heir begrudges the power of the dragon's heritage that's right

1418
06:30:43,180 --> 06:30:49,580
go kill tutorial guy that's so mean i am one of the children of the rejuvenating waters

1419
06:30:49,580 --> 06:30:56,619
created by those who would stop at nothing to achieve immortality my false dragon's blood

1420
06:30:57,180 --> 06:31:06,619
was created by man children so there are many of you i am the only one who survived the process

1421
06:31:06,619 --> 06:31:13,419
the others are laid to i know of another one here i see i do not know if it is right to

1422
06:31:13,419 --> 06:31:20,459
sever the ties of immortality but the dragon's heritage undeniably corrupts the lives of men

1423
06:31:20,459 --> 06:31:27,020

1483
06:51:07,080 --> 06:51:27,740
that he was dead protect the divine heir from so the dragon's heritage has seduced you too

1484

1486
06:52:12,549 --> 06:52:21,909
father to think you were still alive that was my but the same could be said for you

1487
06:52:21,909 --> 06:52:30,810
i was certain you died the power of the divine heir brought me back that's it what the divine

1488
06:52:30,970 --> 06:52:42,569
heir the dragon's blood father now you see it remember the first rule of the code

1489
06:52:42,569 --> 06:52:50,490
as your father i order you to forsake your master from this moment he is your master no

1490
06:52:50,490 --> 06:53:00,009
more forsake the divine heir listen to me wolf obey your father's command and forsake the

1491
06:53:00,009 --> 06:53:10,279
divine heir uh obey the iron code for say kuro break the iron code stay loyal to kuro

1492
06:53:20,740 --> 06:53:45,479

1495
06:54:41,319 --> 06:54:55,770
the point of the first options i got i said i was gonna be loyal miserable display why why

1511
07:00:40,729 --> 07:00:47,930
spongebob that does way too much posture damage you don't want to i'm gonna have to dodge that

1512
07:00:49,209 --> 07:01:40,090
that's actually a good opportunity probably to come in for an attack broken damn i don't

1513
07:01:40,090 --> 07:01:42,729
really have an opportunity to attack him i'm trying to think about the best place

1514
07:01:43,689 --> 07:01:59,830

all right whatever

1516

gotta be an opening somewhere

1517
07:02:16,840 --> 07:02:23,669
i think it's just dancing around until he does that move and then getting the actual health

1518
07:02:23,669 --> 07:02:29,159
damage on him that's what i that's what i would say if i were a video gamer

1519
07:02:56,419 --> 07:03:07,849
there we go as long as that he wins the race just like the turtle

1552
07:15:03,080 --> 07:15:24,790

1553
07:15:24,790 --> 07:15:29,590
mario tennis that guy just because i hated those mechanics that was almost mario tennis

1554
07:15:29,590 --> 07:15:42,419
that was like a seven and i it wasn't even i didn't even die that many times i died like

1555
07:15:42,419 --> 07:15:47,700
three or four times i don't know something about that encounter is mario mario tennising

1556
07:15:47,700 --> 07:16:07,560
me but we'll pick up here tomorrow what encounter i'm talking about the the headless

1557
07:16:08,939 --> 07:16:14,139
the headless magician guy that just stands in this weird tiny little area that you can't

1558
07:16:14,220 --> 07:16:20,580
dodge and you have to coat your sword in magic and he's really slow and he can teleport behind

1559
07:16:20,580 --> 07:16:35,529
you that was close to about a seven in anger for me anyways uh let's get to the bits thanks

1560
07:16:35,529 --> 07:16:39,610
everybody for sticking around it was a shit load of money earlier too you guys are fucking

1561
07:16:39,610 --> 07:16:55,240
spoiling me but this game's really really fun it's essentially you're you're at a hundred

1562
07:16:55,240 --> 07:17:08,389
the whole game let's go back to about seven hours ago let's get this on the screen that

1563
07:17:08,389 --> 07:17:14,119
i can actually see what was a ten on the anger scale i don't think i've ever been a ten on

1564
07:17:14,119 --> 07:17:20,279
the anger scale on stream i think like seven six to seven is the highest i think i've ever been

1565
07:17:20,279 --> 07:17:28,580
actually on camera i don't think i've never been like a nine or a ten on stream i feel

1566
07:17:28,580 --> 07:17:33,700
like a nine or a ten on stream would be like me turning the stream off being so angry at

1567
07:17:33,700 --> 07:17:44,659
something that i've gotten bleeding that's probably what a ten is tennis that's probably

1568
07:17:44,659 --> 07:17:45,459
what a ten is

1569
07:17:52,380 --> 07:18:01,849

the latest second germa video of the quiet man's dreams i want to check out my favorite

1583
07:19:28,099 --> 07:19:33,459
channel on youtube daily english tv i was met with only sadness as the channel has deleted

1584
07:19:33,459 --> 07:19:41,830
all of their videos no longer may we talk about a lazy boy or wait why why would they

1585
07:19:41,830 --> 07:19:54,729
delete every one of their videos that's strange what they had like hundreds of thousands of videos

1586
07:19:54,729 --> 07:20:03,740
didn't they that's insane thank you dork cube for the 250 this really is the only good use

1587
07:20:03,740 --> 07:20:08,459
of poison swamp in a from game it's not just fat roll till you die a slow death because

1588
07:20:08,459 --> 07:20:13,419
they give you all the movement mechanics to avoid it yeah once i realized that it was just

1589
07:20:13,419 --> 07:20:23,500
sort of small the dark souls 3 swamp area is so huge it's just gigantic you can actually

1590
07:20:23,500 --> 07:20:27,020
jump out of the poison i don't think i even got poisoned once in there so really not a big deal

1591
07:20:35,779 --> 07:20:41,779
it was in article 13 didn't wait no article third didn't article 13 just get through like

1592
07:20:41,779 --> 07:20:47,139
the first part of the like the house or something it's it has to get voted on again second time

1593
07:20:48,700 --> 07:20:51,979
it had passed but it's not going into why yet doesn't have to go through one more

1594
07:20:53,779 --> 07:21:01,560
what channel we're talking about daily english tv yeah it's not implemented yet

1595
07:21:02,520 --> 07:21:05,959

1614
07:23:34,729 --> 07:23:43,939
commentary is me struggling to find a monkey it never really just throws you off though

1615
07:23:43,939 --> 07:23:48,500
your timing hits and parrying and jumping around and fighting people and all of a sudden

your permission to make a tf2 item for the scout based on your likeness asking especially

1625
07:25:07,369 --> 07:25:11,369
because there's potential to earn royalties from it and i can add you on the submission if

1626
07:25:11,369 --> 07:25:16,650
you'd like you'd hit me up on twitter or here if needed keep doing you the streams are great

1627
07:25:16,650 --> 07:25:25,080
while working um it really depends on what you're talking about i mean i don't really know

1628
07:25:25,080 --> 07:25:35,139
exactly what you mean but if you uh send me a tweet maybe with what you took with like the

1629
07:25:35,139 --> 07:25:48,729

1636
07:26:37,560 --> 07:26:45,259
known as android 17 from dbz etc that's pretty fucking cool i'm pretty happy about that i just

1637
07:26:45,259 --> 07:26:49,580
want to overcome and get out of my comfort zone of being embarrassed by my voice but

1638
07:26:49,580 --> 07:26:54,220
99 percent of people are too so i have to keep that in mind i always hope you are doing

1641
07:27:15,099 --> 07:27:29,590
so much peaceful hailey good luck to you keep us updated thank you shadows one discipline for

1642
07:27:29,590 --> 07:27:53,939
the i lost it here what was it for the anger link here what is this i don't get it what is

1643
07:27:53,939 --> 07:28:01,270
it is that from office what is that did i say something like this like a few hours ago

1644
07:28:01,909 --> 07:28:08,889
hey pugatron thanks for the 10 bucks don't be angry germa i tried to eat it i really did but

1645
07:28:08,889 --> 07:28:19,959
i wasted items that i was just so upset by it i was so angry just seething at that guy with

1646
07:28:19,959 --> 07:28:24,650
no head it's a good thing i got out of there when i did it's a good thing that i have to

1647
07:28:24,650 --> 07:28:28,569
use items to fight that guy because if i had to stay there and fight that guy for like

1648
07:28:28,569 --> 07:28:33,860
another two hours what was the part when i said i was gonna throw my beer bottle behind

1649
07:28:33,860 --> 07:28:39,740
me as hard as i could was that the was it that guy wait no that happened before didn't

1650
07:28:40,380 --> 07:28:46,729
what fight was that oh that was the ape

1651
07:28:52,259 --> 07:28:55,750
so i did get kind of irritated today but it's just the nature of the game

1652
07:28:56,310 --> 07:29:01,669
i really hope i don't come off as like an asshole or like an obnoxious dick because

1653
07:29:01,669 --> 07:29:08,169
like i i hate thinking that that's happening because there's like angry there's like upset

1654
07:29:08,729 --> 07:29:17,139
and then you like start to crawl into like annoying where you're mad about something and

1655
07:29:17,139 --> 07:29:20,819
you keep talking about how mad you are about something you keep talking shit and then you

1656
07:29:20,819 --> 07:29:28,919
kind of trek into annoying so i hope i didn't trek that far but this game is really it'll

1657
07:29:28,919 --> 07:29:44,619
do it to you it will it just has that effect apologize to green monkey

1658
07:29:48,389 --> 07:29:54,360
hey dr pepper thanks for the 10 dollars there's more where that came from if you do a feed

1659
07:29:54,360 --> 07:29:59,319
cam i will never do a feed cam that's not gonna happen thank you for the 10 bucks though

1660
07:29:59,319 --> 07:30:08,409
that's not ever gonna happen uh internet Jorge thanks for the 15 bucks i've been stressed but

1661
07:30:08,409 --> 07:30:14,380
laughing with your laughing with you kills all the stress they say show love thank you internet

1662
07:30:14,380 --> 07:30:25,419
Jorge thanks for the 15 dollars it depends if you're actually critical of the game design

1663
07:30:29,259 --> 07:30:36,599
trust no one's got a new video i'm gonna queue this up i'll queue that up we'll watch

1664
07:30:36,599 --> 07:30:43,130
it right at the very end um yeah i don't like to be too critical of game design and

1665
07:30:43,130 --> 07:30:49,689
because i know that is it's you just get it rubs people's just the wrong way but in that little

1666
07:30:49,689 --> 07:31:01,189
zone with the no dodging i don't know if it's critical or if it's uh if it's just disappointment

1667
07:31:01,849 --> 07:31:07,939
that i couldn't move i don't know anger is a funny thing frustration is a frustration is a

1668
07:31:07,939 --> 07:31:14,229
funny thing because no matter what happens you are always going to try to find a way to

1669
07:31:14,389 --> 07:31:21,880
a way to relieve your frustration and sometimes that's just like talking shit just out loud

1670
07:31:27,430 --> 07:31:34,680
it's just salt yeah salt just it just happens and like i said there's a way to hopefully not

1671
07:31:34,680 --> 07:31:42,970
cross that threshold of salt into all right dude relax you're fucking irritating i really

1672
07:31:42,970 --> 07:31:54,340
hope i don't ever get there and if i do sorry that i did it is that kind of game

1673
07:31:56,040 --> 07:32:06,259
extra salt uh we also had it's time for slime thanks to three bucks not sure we solved this

1674
07:32:06,259 --> 07:32:21,580
but vinnie uh watched the clip of you playing mad dog mccree oh god this is the best game

1675
07:32:21,580 --> 07:32:35,700
ever made i think this actually might be the best game i've ever played

1676
07:32:46,580 --> 07:33:04,259
okay now someone needs to clip me doing this

1677
07:33:05,700 --> 07:33:09,220
someone needs to clip me laughing over that and send it to another streamer

1678
07:33:09,220 --> 07:33:15,880
hey he sent it to me i'm that streamer all right now somebody's gonna clip that

1679
07:33:15,880 --> 07:33:30,459

07:40:26,310 --> 07:40:29,430
and if i get your blessing before going through with it how can i propose it to you

1714

1720
07:41:37,349 --> 07:41:46,060
it's called germa 985 stream clips and they green light you and you just put germa 985

1721
07:41:46,060 --> 07:41:51,020
stream clips up on like nbc at like eight o'clock prime time or something then it would kind of be

1722
07:41:51,020 --> 07:42:05,240
like all right um that's me any chance of you going back to hollow knight no probably not

1723
07:42:06,819 --> 07:42:12,900
probably not i keep hearing the idea in my brain to go play it again but i just don't think

1724
07:42:12,900 --> 07:42:39,669
it's gonna happen i'm sorry my scatter brain ruins playthroughs it does oh sakiro sakiro

1727
07:42:57,209 --> 07:43:05,459

1728
07:43:05,459 --> 07:43:11,900
like an hour or two on top of that i have like another one or two playstation 2 games

1729
07:43:11,900 --> 07:43:23,139
it might be fun mr mosquito is going to be that's like an old one rare but after monster

1730
07:43:23,139 --> 07:43:29,349
rancher four to mr mosquito i'm going to go back to vr again this is so much stuff to do

1731
