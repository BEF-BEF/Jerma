1
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:50,750
Hey, somebody said sup loser. Sup butt head. Hey sup butt head. How you doing? What's up? You're doing good. Cool. Cool. You're late. Yeah. All right. No, I'm not because you're not putting the German 985 on time formula. You're not putting the variables in. Two o'clock means 2 30. You didn't put the you know parentheses like exclamation point 30 minutes, right?

2
00:00:51,049 --> 00:00:52,820
I've been hey, I've been pulling the time back to make sure that I'm here before four o'clock. Think about that, right? It's 2 30 p.m. right now. I usually stream at four. We've pulled back an hour and a half. Look at this. Look what time it is right now. Well, it's unbelievable. 2 30 instead of 4 p.m. an hour and a half. Are you seeing this? You've done this for one day. Shake this up. What an accomplishment.

3
00:01:31,400 --> 00:02:11,259
I know, right? We got a lot to talk about. I've got wondering where I've been the last week. My head is my head has been down. I've been writing. I've been working on the phone with hundreds of people. Mine is probably like 70. Maybe like 30. I've got some things to hype up to you now. One of them I can't I can't talk that much about but I'm gonna because I don't fucking care. All right, first things first,

4
00:02:11,259 --> 00:02:59,990
Look at this list. All right, first thing. Are we people here? Are we here? How many people here? There's only three people here. I'm waiting till at least 10. There's only just three people there. I need at least 10 people. 3k Andy. That's a lot of fucking people. That's a huge amount of people. That is a massive audience. He's getting washed up. No, don't not. That is a massive audience. Even if okay, okay, let's just say for instance, that like for some reason,

5
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:46,840
the next, I don't know, whatever, I don't make me think like this. 5000 concurrent viewers is a shitload of people. It's an insane amount of people. I would start to feel concerned if it was like, I don't know, maybe like 1000 500. Maybe I'd start to get a little concerned that like, what did I do? Dude, you fucking fell off. Let's get it to 1k. No, you know, let's take a minute because I've there's a lot we're about to talk about. And I want to be able to announce them with a

6
00:03:46,840 --> 00:04:35,910
everybody here. Give it 10 minutes. Yeah, I don't I don't I don't do a countdown. More fucking delays. Stop saying fucking okay. Stop. So good. Oh, let me know. Here's what I can do. For a second. I was just Oh, let's talk about my tweet from last night. I was okay. So I was let me give you some backstory here. So I was I was kind of high last night. I had some marijuana products, which

7
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:54,560
you're the legal age. And you don't go overboard and you and you're very good at moderation and you take care of yourself, right? Okay. I was sitting there. And I saw that there's this meme of monitors or something. It's like, what, what are you? What kind of monitor? The kind of

8
00:04:54,560 --> 00:05:27,860
Dungeons and Dragons kind of character are you right? And I was looking at the ones where people put a monitor on top of another monitor. Like you have your monitor here and then a monitor up or down below or above it. And I was sitting there talking to Holly and I'm like, there's no way I could ever fucking do that. And I just started writing up a tweet. And I asked her, I was like, is this funny? Is this tweet funny? And she, she kind of laughed for a second. She was like, Yeah,

9
00:05:27,860 --> 00:06:11,089
I mean, it is. So I was like, Okay, hold on. I'm gonna get up and I'm gonna get up. And I'm gonna make sure this is funny. Right? Because like, I'm kind of high. Maybe it's not that funny. So here's what you guys tell me because I had to sleep on it. You tell me if you think this is funny. I can't do monitor on top of monitor. They need to be side by side. Can't handle that McDonald's menu bullshit. Is that funny? Was that like funny enough for a tweet? That was a little funny.

10
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:12,730
She also did say it was adorable too. Oh, the idea is funny. That's trying too hard. But the thing is, I wasn't trying too hard. I was just kind of, I was fucking zonked. You do not try hard when you're zonked. I'm sorry. There's no like, Oh, man, I gotta do something funny. I just started writing. I was like, I think this is funny. So I'm like, I wasn't trying hard with that tweet. It was just kind of coming out. It's funny in theory. Okay, but not in practice. Does

11
00:06:52,589 --> 00:07:30,079
Okay, does that mean that it was funny? The idea was funny, but it needed some better kind of more funny, maybe language or something to make it funnier? Okay, what if I put fucking in between McDonald's and menu? If you know, for instance, if it's like, oh, they need to be side by side, I can't handle that fucking McDonald's menu bullshit, right? I think that might be funny. That might be actually a comedic take on things. All right, shut up. Let's move on. Anyways, today we're going to play ultra kill.

12
00:07:30,079 --> 00:08:12,449
It's a game that's been requested a lot. It's a FPS game seems like fun, I guess. It's an old boomer shooter, or it's kind of like, in that realm. It needs work. I'm not ordering out of McDonald's for God sakes. That would have been funnier. Hold on. Let's read that one. Okay, hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Shit. I think that might be it. I can't do. I can't do monitor on top of monitor. They need to be side by side. What was the joke? I forgot it already.

13
00:08:12,449 --> 00:08:28,329
What was it? So you have to write it again. I actually just forgot the whole thing. I'm like looking at my phone. I would give booed at open mic night if I was there. What was it? What did you say?

14
00:08:30,149 --> 00:08:51,100
German there's 10 people who make the announcement or we're gonna leave. Just wait. I haven't streamed in like six days. What was it? Okay. Okay. Okay. God, I can't do monitor on top of monitor. They need to be side by side. I'm not ordering at a McDonald's for God sakes. Now that's worse.

15
00:08:51,460 --> 00:09:35,929
I think there needs to be more time. But before you get to the punchline, I think that's too quick. Hurry up and make the announcement. Guys, we have like 30 minutes of announcements. I'm not like I'm not about to announce one thing. Let's what is it? The line just isn't funny. Hmm. That's all right. All right. Whatever. You get the idea. Okay, what? Okay. What about at the end? I said it's more than time. I guarantee you, you'd click like on it. You understand how stupid fucking you know, you understand? I'm sitting here trying to craft a fucking funny tweet.

16
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:51,500
Trying to craft some comedy and observational humor. Nope. No, I just just write it's more than time at the end and it'll get 100,000 likes. You understand? Actually, that would be kind of funny.

17
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:54,860
Let me try that one.

18
00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:09,740
That's actually kind of funny. I can't do monitor on top of monitor. They need to be side by side. Can't handle that McDonald's menu bullshit. It's more than time. Actually, that makes it better.

19
00:10:11,259 --> 00:10:45,659
Why does that make it funnier? That sucks. Why? That's so annoying. Oh, there it is. Oh, that's I know it shouldn't be funny. That's that's annoying to me. It's annoying me that it's funny. It's annoying me. But that is funny. Damn it. All right. It is fun. Okay, so here's what we're doing. Playing ultra kill. You know that. That's what you know. Here's what you don't know.

20
00:10:45,659 --> 00:10:46,460
Submissions for the green screen actions are going to be closing this weekend. This is the first of many announcements we're going to be talking about on the morning announcements here. This is you have two days you have until Sunday night, Monday morning, maybe another like two days or so. I mean, it's been open for a week and a half or so. It's been up for a week. There's already so much shit. So you got if you by the way, what is it? What are we talking about? I'm going back to the

21
00:11:23,559 --> 00:12:05,139
back in front of the green screen one more time to complete the green screen trilogy. Where's the tweet? I don't tweet. Guys, one day I will tweet out all of my drafts. I'm just going to tweet out like five images on Twitter and it's all going to be all my drafts and you can just laugh at all of them. I don't care. Do that today. No, I'm holding them. But anyways, yeah, you have another about 48 ish hours to give a suggestion of an action you want to see me do in front of the green screen. I will be getting in front of the green screen.

22
00:12:06,389 --> 00:12:40,970
I have a date. I have a date in mind, but I might need to change it. So I'm not going to tell you, but it's going to be within the next week and a half. Depending on how many props I need to get. I'm going to have to maybe move it to like a week and a half from now. So I will be getting in front of the screen within the next 10 to 12 days with all the suggestions. And by the way, I got to make this really wet. We got to go over this because I know this is going to be kind of tricky to kind of deal with this maybe.

23
00:12:42,009 --> 00:13:13,750
But the last time we did the green screen stream, we had a lot of submissions. There were a ton. The channel has grown by about three to four hundred percent since that stream. And it's I'm imagining there might be potentially thousands of submissions to this. So if you submit something, even if it's good, it's going to be so hard for us to vet out a ton of videos. We're going to have to pick.

24
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:35,700
We're going to have to narrow it down by a lot. So if there are if there are like five thousand video submissions, it'll be physically impossible to watch them. So what's going to happen is we're going to be narrowing this down to maybe only six to seven hours worth of content, maybe 12 hours to be able to do it a couple of nights.

25
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:57,690
Have an encore night. So if you submit something, it's not guaranteed to be put in any action. You say it's just not you just put it out there and hope for the best because it's going to be really difficult to narrow down like three or four or five thousand video submissions or even submissions in general, only six to seven hours.

26
00:13:57,690 --> 00:14:12,809
That's a lot. And if you were there last time, we do get to a point where there's sort of after like three or four streams worth of green screen stuff, you can kind of like come in with infomercial exhaustion.

27
00:14:12,809 --> 00:14:26,250
Do you remember that? I don't want to get to a point where we're just kind of blinking our eyes sitting there going, geez, OK, I guess here comes another one. Here comes another one. It's you can get green screen exhaustion.

28
00:14:28,789 --> 00:14:40,970
So I'm looking for like 10 to 12 hours of footage to show over the course of two or three streams. I ain't showing 10,000. I'm not showing 10,000 green screen videos. It's not fucking happening.

29
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:53,110
All right. But that will be happening in June here. That's like the thing that we're going to do in June. I'm going to get in front of the screen.

30
00:14:53,110 --> 00:15:05,850
You'll have, I want to say, maybe two weeks to put something together and then somewhere in the want to say, third or fourth week of June, we're going to do that. We'll do the night. It should be fun.

31
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:17,029
Hard dates will come out in the next three or four days, I would assume. It's an assignment. Yeah. So that's that announcement. There you go. That's green screen somewhere in the middle of June.

32
00:15:17,029 --> 00:15:21,419
I'm getting in front of it. And then in the end of June, we're going to watch the videos and it's going to be fucking PogChamp.

33
00:15:21,419 --> 00:15:31,610
I want to see PogChamps in chat. Giving us homework. That's right. Do this IRL. Yeah, I did it. Okay. Second thing.

34
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:47,480
Announcement two of four Grotto Beasts. Ladies and gentlemen, Grotto Beasts is, I would say it's the train is kind of pulling into the station.

35
00:15:48,649 --> 00:15:59,779
There's still needs a little bit more time. It looks insane. I haven't really talked that much about it because it's I don't it's fucking ridiculous. Let's just put it that way.

36
00:15:59,779 --> 00:16:08,570
It's going to be probably ready for I hope we can figure out some, you know, whatever the fulfillment that we're going to be using.

37
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:16,360
The idea is that this will be something that we can get off the ground by the fall of this year.

38
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:24,230
Like that's it. I said March, I said February, March last year, and it was just not even close to being a realistic thing to do.

39
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:30,779
So we're hoping that somewhere in fall, it'll be actually be able to get it. Have it on your desk. And there it is Grotto Beasts.

40
00:16:30,779 --> 00:16:40,019
They are going to be the Grotto Beasts team will be start being more active on Twitter. So go follow the Grotto Beasts Twitter.

41
00:16:40,019 --> 00:16:46,179
Can we get some of the mods to put that it's not NFTs. What are you talking about? No, what? Why? How many times do I say this?

42
00:16:46,259 --> 00:16:54,820
It's not it's not NFTs. It's physical. You're going to have the card in your hand. It's a physical card game.

43
00:16:54,820 --> 00:17:03,590
It's not NFT. What are you talking about? It's all right. So when people were talking about Grotto Beasts like six months ago,

44
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:10,630
it's like I've got this thing Grotto Beasts. Jerma, is it NFTs? No. OK, good. Another two months go by.

45
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:17,779
Hey, yeah, Grotto Beasts is coming along. It's German. It's not NFTs, is it? No. No, it's not. No. OK, good. Good.

46
00:17:17,779 --> 00:17:36,890
Just making sure. Hey, Jerma, are they NFTs? No, they're not NFTs. OK, sorry. I just had to scream into my into my shirt there.

47
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:42,220
No, they're not NFTs. It's a physical card game. It's a physical card game. There's nothing to do with that.

48
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:51,559
There's not anything to do with NFTs. Understandable. Yeah. MonkaW calm down.

49
00:17:53,799 --> 00:18:03,960
Oh, that's worse noise. That was that was no, you can't have another scoop of ice cream, baby.

50
00:18:05,019 --> 00:18:21,000
Why not? Dandrum. Toddler. That was loud as fuck, was it? I can't. Whatever.

51
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:32,039
All right. No, they're not NFTs. It's a physical card collection. You're just going to buy it and

52
00:18:32,039 --> 00:18:38,259
you can have it. And there it is. That's it. But trains coming into the station, you should be able

53
00:18:38,259 --> 00:18:45,430
to keep on the lookout for follow the Grotto Beasts Twitter. Follow me on Twitter. You know,

54
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:49,369
I might have something to say about it. But yeah, that project is going to be coming to

55
00:18:49,369 --> 00:18:53,690
a close and I'm really excited about it. It should be really cool. Might have a stream

56
00:18:54,569 --> 00:19:00,170
that is kind of based around that project. No details for you now, but just know that

57
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:05,930
it probably will happen. OK, announcement three of four. You already know this one,

58
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:10,410
but baseball is pretty much locked in, ready to go. I'm incredibly excited for it.

59
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:13,849
It's going to be like the most fun I've had on camera. And I keep saying that every

60
00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:18,180
event stream that I do, but I'm willing to give you a few details.

61
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:25,210
So this is the German Baseball Association. It's going to be an exhibition game between

62
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:31,960
the Cincinnati Clowns and the Maryland Magicians. That's all you really need to know. But you see,

63
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:35,880
I mean, it's going to be in the middle of the they're currently going to be in the middle

64
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:43,269
of their season. So should be should be an interesting, interesting time. That's July 14th.

65
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:57,589
Mark it on your calendar if you have to. Can we bet? No, I mean, it's just an exhibition game.

66
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:12,359
Let us gamble on that. No, I know. Well, maybe. I don't know. So that's a yes. No, I don't know.

67
00:20:12,359 --> 00:20:19,619
I don't want you betting on the game. But yeah, that's that is the stream. I'm very excited about

68
00:20:19,619 --> 00:20:24,819
it. I've been waiting to do this stream for two years. If you've been following the channel for

69
00:20:24,819 --> 00:20:32,220
a long time, you know that that project has hit multiple COVID snags. Two years ago when I wanted

70
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:40,940
to do it, we physically couldn't because of COVID. And then a year later, we still had issues with

71
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:48,359
can we do this because the the whole idea with that stream remember is it is going to be it's

72
00:20:48,359 --> 00:20:53,319
not just going to be like a couple of people hanging out and playing a game. It's it's two

73
00:20:54,119 --> 00:21:01,299
baseball teams. It's gonna be like 30 fucking people there. So that's a there's a lot of people

74
00:21:01,299 --> 00:21:06,420
and it had to keep getting postponed and postponed and postponed two years ago because of COVID.

75
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:11,380
But I'm incredibly excited for that streams. I can't wait. It's gonna be so much fun.

76
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:16,119
And you'll see why I feel that way. And I'll be hyping it up because I don't want people to

77
00:21:16,119 --> 00:21:21,319
not know that's not that that's happening. Right. July 14th. I'll get a time for you. We're probably

78
00:21:21,319 --> 00:21:27,299
shooting for the afternoon. But yeah, I'm very excited about it. The fourth thing that I'm really

79
00:21:27,299 --> 00:21:37,079
excited about. Why is it city versus a state? Well, let me tell you about just pulling random

80
00:21:37,079 --> 00:21:43,049
fucking city and state names out of a hat to come up with names for these teams. Because that's what

81
00:21:43,049 --> 00:21:47,849
pretty much I was doing. I was just like, okay, I guess that's what it is. City versus state.

82
00:21:51,859 --> 00:22:01,240
That's actually really funny. Cincinnati versus Maryland. Yeah, but that's no that's

83
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:07,140
bullshit. Okay. What about the New England Patriots? That's literally just a general

84
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:18,259
area of the world. The New England Patriots. The Florida Marlins. Yeah. What are you talking about?

85
00:22:21,509 --> 00:22:28,779
They do that already. Yeah, I'm fine. Everything's fine. Don't worry about it.

86
00:22:28,779 --> 00:22:38,650
Yeah, there's tons of this. Yeah, come on. Come on, Gwen. Give me a break. They're the Miami Marlins.

87
00:22:39,529 --> 00:22:50,619
I don't care. I wasn't sitting here when I was coming up with the team names going,

88
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:59,660
hold on a minute. Oh, yes. No, I was just like, what? What? I need a name for the clowns. I don't

89
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:09,799
care. But that makes it funnier. I don't care. It's funny. And there may have been graphics that

90
00:23:09,799 --> 00:23:21,769
have already been already been made. So who cares? But anyways, ladies and gentlemen,

91
00:23:21,769 --> 00:23:25,529
the last announcement I'm going to make for you today is the announcement of an announcement.

92
00:23:26,329 --> 00:23:32,390
I yeah, I love doing those. There's another huge project that's going to be probably somewhere

93
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:40,099
between August and October. It's going to be massive. Currently spent the last maybe four or

94
00:23:40,099 --> 00:23:45,539
five days reaching out to certain people getting interest getting gauging people's opinions on

95
00:23:45,539 --> 00:23:52,680
things. But there's probably is going to be a major project that's going to happen between August

96
00:23:52,680 --> 00:24:01,529
and October. I want this summer to be nuts. You know what I mean? Is it like a dollhouse level?

97
00:24:01,529 --> 00:24:19,000
Yes. It's not dollhouse two. I don't do sequels. I don't do sequels. It's a prequel. So

98
00:24:21,099 --> 00:24:27,579
a green screen three. But that's different though. Yeah, I'm fine. I do trilogies. I do

99
00:24:27,579 --> 00:24:32,059
trilogies. I don't do sequels. There you go. So dollhouse was never supposed to be a trilogy.

100
00:24:32,059 --> 00:24:40,089
Green screen was supposed to be a trilogy. So that's different. But yeah, I'm so excited

101
00:24:40,089 --> 00:24:46,569
about this. I will tell you I don't it's so hard to tell anything because if it has to change for

102
00:24:46,569 --> 00:24:50,730
some reason or it doesn't work out. But just here you go. Here's all I'm going to tell you.

103
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:53,369
But just be ready. That stream is going to happen somewhere between August and October.

104
00:24:55,240 --> 00:25:01,059
There's a character on the stream that a lot of people like. I'm sure you will see them again

105
00:25:01,619 --> 00:25:10,519
for something. Whatever that is. Who knows? Whatever that could be. But there is going to

106
00:25:10,519 --> 00:25:19,559
be a stream. I hope I'm hoping that we can get it together. I don't know. Who knows? There you go.

107
00:25:21,079 --> 00:25:24,539
Oh, thanks for the announcement, dude. You literally just said, hey, a project,

108
00:25:24,619 --> 00:25:33,640
big project August. Bye. I know. But I'm just so excited for it. The last like three or four days,

109
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:37,640
I've just been like fucking just like writer Andy just like writing a fucking novel about these

110
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:46,779
things. So in due time, you will know. But I'm very excited for it. But I'm really hoping that

111
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:52,700
it's going to be by August. I mean, by October, without a doubt, because there's no I can't do

112
00:25:52,700 --> 00:26:00,940
it after October. It's no way. So there you go. That's there's your like, let's catch up

113
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:11,400
because you've been gone for like, five days. All right, I'm going I'm going to squelch some

114
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:17,049
rumors here. It is not catboy related. Sorry, I'm gonna have to squelch some rumors. I'm seeing

115
00:26:17,049 --> 00:26:28,220
some rumors in the chat. It is not catboy related. squelch. Yeah, it's like an old

116
00:26:28,779 --> 00:26:41,700
World of Warcraft term where you've muted somebody. How do you guys not know that?

117
00:26:46,089 --> 00:26:52,279
Is it a rat boy stream? No, it's not. It's not a time. All right, we gotta go. I gotta I gotta

118
00:26:52,279 --> 00:26:59,000
stream. We gotta I gotta go. No, I gotta go stay. I haven't even started. All right, let's go.

119
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:09,380
But TLDR. Holy shit. I'm excited for the summer. After the summer. Wow. The summer should be full

120
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:17,779
of fun stuff. I'm very excited. Let's go. Let's play ultra kill. Should be able to see me now.

121
00:27:17,779 --> 00:27:25,130
Can you see me? Can you guys see me? They can't say anything. Well, oops. Can you see there you

122
00:27:25,130 --> 00:27:30,569
go? You can see that now, can't you? Now, what about me? Can you see what about me? Can you see

123
00:27:30,569 --> 00:27:39,259
me? What about me? Can you see me now? Hey, kid. How are you? Hi. So I ultra kill is a first person

124
00:27:39,259 --> 00:27:52,819
shooter game. You're gonna squelch me? All right, that's fine. Okay. All right. So ultra kill. I

125
00:27:52,819 --> 00:27:56,660
don't know anything about it. I know it's a video game. It came out two years ago. Oh, well, so

126
00:27:56,660 --> 00:28:03,380
okay. Is that a problem? This game came out two years ago. I play games that came out 10 years

127
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:13,349
ago all the time on this channel. It's still in development. Too loud. Should I put both headphones

128
00:28:13,349 --> 00:28:20,359
in? This is a gamer game, right? This is from the very beginning. I've never I don't know. I've never

129
00:28:20,359 --> 00:28:25,180
played this. This is a gamer game, isn't it? All right. If it's a gamer game, I think I can handle

130
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:43,960
it. How did how did the three stooges used to do that? It was like did it did did it. I don't know.

131
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:54,230
They were fucking professionals. All right, keep out mouse five to punch. This is really fucking

132
00:28:54,230 --> 00:29:05,299
loud. I gotta turn it down. Like it's too loud for me. Like way too loud. Okay. Now is it too

133
00:29:05,299 --> 00:29:11,819
loud for you? What do you what do you guys think? How do you have five buttons on your mouse? I don't

134
00:29:11,819 --> 00:29:20,490
I have three. I don't know why it's called mouse five. It's weird. Okay, so that's punch. Left

135
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:28,259
control is slide. That didn't work. I have to hold it. Okay. Shift to dash consumes stamina.

136
00:29:28,819 --> 00:29:37,420
You can dash in the air and you can double jump too. Okay. All right. So now do I have a gun?

137
00:29:38,549 --> 00:29:43,430
Deal close range damage to douse yourself in fresh blood. This is the only way to regain health.

138
00:29:46,809 --> 00:29:56,069
I don't I feel like gonna make a comment on it. So like I'm just gonna show you that I'm drinking

139
00:29:56,069 --> 00:30:00,710
this today. This is like I know people gonna say it's like fucking sewer water. But like look,

140
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:07,319
here you go. Get it out of your system. Okay, I just I literally just took a sip out of it. I took

141
00:30:07,319 --> 00:30:16,869
a sip out of the sewer water. So you can laugh about it. Okay, jump well near a wall to wall jump.

142
00:30:17,509 --> 00:30:27,779
Okay, control in the air to ground slam. Okay, there's a lot of things that you can do.

143
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:34,789
Jesus, this is still loud somehow. Most levels have secret soul orbs. Touch them to get point

144
00:30:34,789 --> 00:30:51,240
bonus. Ow. That it? All right. Where does the where does the gogoda gogoda start?

145
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:58,220
When does it when does it start? It's got I know it's gonna start. When does the gogoda gogoda

146
00:30:58,220 --> 00:31:20,019
start? Come on. New blood presents. Come on. Where's the gogoda? Come on. A game by RC.

147
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:27,910
Hakita. Where is it? Here it comes.

148
00:31:43,529 --> 00:32:06,150
Oh, all right. So this thing looks chaotic. So wait, do I have to? Okay, well, this thing

149
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:32,329
charges. Do I deserve reload or no? Get the fuck out of here. Turn the music up. But I don't like

150
00:32:32,329 --> 00:32:44,549
music. Like that. I'm gonna turn the sensitivity up just a little bit. I put it way too down.

151
00:32:45,109 --> 00:32:54,980
Where is it? Okay. Maybe like 15. It feels a little better. Hold right button to charge. Oh,

152
00:32:54,980 --> 00:33:04,069
that's how I did it. And then do I let it go? The music's good. I know. But I just don't music.

153
00:33:04,069 --> 00:33:11,660
I'm a fucking weirdo. All right. I don't really listen to that much music. All right. That's

154
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:40,359
fucking sick. How am I getting a C? I should be getting one that. Oh, shit. That sensitivities.

155
00:33:40,839 --> 00:33:53,180
Sensitivities still high. 12. C for cool. Hit control. All right. That feels good.

156
00:34:11,289 --> 00:34:38,300
Oh, come on. That's a B. That's an A. This dude's morbid right now. I don't even know what that

157
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:49,719
means. Punch to deflect. I didn't get it. I don't get it. What's going on? Okay. That's very

158
00:34:49,719 --> 00:34:53,909
specific. I'm just gonna do the bloodborne technique and that's just dodge everything

159
00:34:53,909 --> 00:35:13,079
and don't ever parry. This is chaotic. Yeah, it is. It's fun though. This is really fun.

160
00:35:13,639 --> 00:35:39,380
Any secrets? Oh, shit. I'm sliding. That's pretty fun. Nice. Oh, you're so glad I'm playing this.

161
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:54,710
I mean, it looks fun. Ground slam deals damage on direct hits. Where'd they go? Whoa. Oh,

162
00:35:54,710 --> 00:36:00,630
you can launch them in the air. Oh, you can launch them in the air. Why did my Boston just come out?

163
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:46,889
Oops. I died. What happens? Do I get to keep going? Fuck you. What the fuck?

164
00:36:50,809 --> 00:37:25,610
I'm literally hitting it with my hand. Nice. Got it. Boss? My hands are like all sweaty.

165
00:37:56,889 --> 00:38:23,780
Why am I having a vampire? I'm waking up. I'm where we're then. Off beat. No, I'm not gonna do

166
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:50,340
it. All right. How do I go? Why did this crash? No, it didn't. I'm an idiot. You know one song.

167
00:38:50,340 --> 00:39:00,139
Tip of the day. Hits game weapons like the revolver do locational damage. The headshot

168
00:39:00,139 --> 00:39:21,239
deals two times damage and a limb shot deals 1.5 damage. Cool. Weapons. Revolver. Oh, what? Really?

169
00:39:21,239 --> 00:39:29,639
Whoa, this is cool. Can I upgrade this? Okay, so let me see. Cycle through equipped variations

170
00:39:29,639 --> 00:39:39,940
with E. So what is this? This is a... Okay, so if I throw the coin in the air, bing, boom. It'll

171
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:46,760
and it'll hit somebody's weak point. Okay. What about actual just kind of damage and shit?

172
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:56,099
Are these the same exact weapon with the only difference being the right click? They're the

173
00:39:56,099 --> 00:40:13,110
same. Okay. All right. That's cool. What about the other stuff? Enemies. The cyber grind. I don't want

174
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:36,150
to do that yet. Sandbox. Okay. So do I just go? What do I do? Can I just go? Let's go. That's

175
00:40:36,150 --> 00:41:22,340
fucking cool. That was... That's really cool. I got an S on this one. Oh, double S. That's double S.

176
00:41:32,010 --> 00:42:09,369
I didn't lie. Sorry. That was probably really loud. I'm sorry. That was not so loud. I'm sorry.

177
00:42:10,739 --> 00:42:45,420
I got to like go like this. Like, oh, I'm all right. What is this? Was I already in here? What is that?

178
00:42:45,980 --> 00:43:08,809
I don't get it. I don't get it. It's for a secret level. Object. I got to turn this down, man. I

179
00:43:08,809 --> 00:43:20,889
can't fucking hear it. I'm sorry. I just... It's good. I have to find something and put it here.

180
00:43:20,889 --> 00:43:56,550
All right. Whatever. I'll find something and put it here, Andy. Right? Okay. Who's this? Ultra,

181
00:43:56,550 --> 00:44:22,650
ultra, ultra. Oh, I got it. Why are you speaking like an AI today? How am I speaking like an AI?

182
00:44:22,650 --> 00:44:37,590
Under construction. Okay. Should I just keep going? New camera angle means fake germo. Oh,

183
00:44:37,590 --> 00:44:41,670
it's the camera angle. I see. Oh, all right. I see. People are concerned about the camera.

184
00:44:41,670 --> 00:44:46,889
How come I'm eating something? I'm not. I'm drinking fucking sludge that I got from the sewer.

185
00:44:46,889 --> 00:45:02,730
Look, this is sludge water. I'm drinking sludge water. Okay. I kind of like this better, but

186
00:45:02,730 --> 00:45:53,139
we'll see. This is... This game's fun as hell. Oh, wait, wait, wait. No. Wait. Can I get up there?

187
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:10,489
Oh, okay. Ooh. So what does this do? I get bonus points. I don't know what that does,

188
00:46:10,489 --> 00:46:22,539
but cool. I got it. Boss door. Wait, don't go in the boss door yet. It's probably other stuff.

189
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:43,940
Go up. Is there a shotgun in this game? Insufficient firepower. What? Bullshit. Bullshit.

190
00:46:44,500 --> 00:47:03,099
Is there fall damage? You can throw multiple coins at once. Do they both shoot out? Wait,

191
00:47:03,099 --> 00:47:14,500
what? Turn up the volume. Got you. I got you. I got you. I got you. Wait, what's this?

192
00:47:15,059 --> 00:47:20,809
Oh, it wants to know if I want to change weapons for the boss. Nah, I got this.

193
00:47:34,980 --> 00:48:25,960
Holy shit. That was... Whoa. What's going on? Shotgun? The blood heals you. Oh, that's right.

194
00:48:26,679 --> 00:48:29,800
All right. Well, I don't want to go that way yet because I want to... I want to go back up.

195
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:44,440
This is going to be my favorite. Should I blow these up? Can I get points or money or anything

196
00:48:44,440 --> 00:49:04,070
from those or no? Punch the shotgun bullets. What? Are you serious? What are you talking about?

197
00:49:15,380 --> 00:49:26,650
Oh, that's fucking loud, but it's good. Shotgun is the best item in the game.

198
00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:58,599
Supreme. Anarchic. Brutal. Anarchic. Brutal. Chaotic. Destructive.

199
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:34,860
How do I take a new weapon? Announcer Andy. League of Legends announcer pack.

200
00:50:36,219 --> 00:51:08,280
Don't go over there. Brutal. I need to get over SS. This is probably a secret. I wasn't even

201
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:15,699
fucking close, dude. What are you talking about? I wasn't even close. It's sadistic.

202
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:24,539
That was probably loud. I'm sorry. Oh, I can't do it. It's going to be loud. It's going to be

203
00:51:24,539 --> 00:51:29,460
too loud. I can't do it. It's going to be way too fucking loud. I can't do it. It's going to be too

204
00:51:29,460 --> 00:51:34,789
loud. I was going to scream ultra, but I don't have a compressor on this mic, so it's going to

205
00:51:35,110 --> 00:51:52,420
be fucking horrible to listen to. Oh, yeah. Anarchic. Supreme. Oh, I'm ready to say it.

206
00:51:52,420 --> 00:52:16,099
Shitstorm. Come on, play better at the game. I want to say it. I want to say it so bad.

207
00:52:17,219 --> 00:52:22,579
You have no idea how badly I want to say it. Brutal. Not good enough. Come on, you piece of

208
00:52:22,579 --> 00:53:45,079
shit. Hurry up. Brutal. No. No. Just chaotic. It's okay. Come on. Come on. You can do it. I know

209
00:53:45,079 --> 00:54:21,539
you. I got it. Fuck. Brutal. Sabre Wolf. You can flip other weapons. What? Play on a higher

210
00:54:21,539 --> 00:54:35,349
difficulty. I'm on normal. Is normal too easy? That didn't feel easy. I have money, right?

211
00:54:37,269 --> 00:55:09,369
Revolver. Shotgun. Ooh. What does that do? That was weird.

212
00:55:11,539 --> 00:55:29,610
You can do that four times. Three times. All right. So, but it just kills you. I can't.

213
00:55:29,610 --> 00:55:41,130
It can't do it four times. Three times is too much. What if I jump? You can't do it four times.

214
00:55:41,130 --> 00:55:47,369
It's one, two, boom. One, two, boom. All right. I can handle that. I can handle that. Switch weapon

215
00:55:47,369 --> 00:55:54,869
before it explodes. I don't know if I got anything. It could be like a rocket jump.

216
00:55:55,510 --> 00:56:08,309
I'll try it. I like one, two, three, one, two, three. We'll try it. This is going to start to get

217
00:56:08,309 --> 00:56:20,570
confusing. Time it with the... All right. I don't do those advanced. I play on normal. I don't do

218
00:56:20,570 --> 00:57:27,909
advanced techniques. New enemy. New enemy type. What the fuck? Why did it bounce? Fucking die.

219
00:57:29,420 --> 00:58:13,210
Die. That thing was ridiculous. That first boss is now a regular enemy. Sadistic. Okay. Wait. What's

220
00:58:13,210 --> 00:58:36,170
up here? Found a secret. What's the red? Holy fucking shit. What? What the fuck? Huh? No way.

221
00:58:36,889 --> 00:59:27,050
What is hitting me? Should I try it again? What if I can't do it? Oh, that's fucking impossible.

222
00:59:27,050 --> 00:59:33,780
That's literally not possible. That's impossible. That's not even possible. That's physically not

223
00:59:33,780 --> 01:00:05,190
possible encounter. You're an old lady. I'm not an old lady. I'll prove it. I don't think I can

224
01:00:05,190 --> 01:00:50,780
fucking do it. I'm going to head to bed. Can you wish me a good night? Have a good night. Whatever

225
01:00:50,780 --> 01:01:39,079
that was. Who is it? Fuck you. No. What the fuck is this bullshit? What is this bullshit?

226
01:01:41,300 --> 01:01:50,739
Okay. I did it. I did it. I did it. Red soul orbs give 200 health. Overheal cannot be regained

227
01:01:50,739 --> 01:01:59,929
with blood. It's just an overheal. It's just an overheal. That's it. You're scary today.

228
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:12,139
I'm not. I'm fine. Don't scream into the mic. I'm trying not to. I promise. I'm not trying to be

229
01:02:12,139 --> 01:02:23,579
loud. Is it loud? What should I do about it? I'm trying to like, just not scream. Is it fine?

230
01:02:24,219 --> 01:02:41,289
Is it big? Can I go up here? Why can I go? Can I do it now? You're fine. It was one guy. Okay.

231
01:02:41,929 --> 01:03:02,570
I missed. What? What the fuck? Oh, the glass is. All right. I got to stay up here.

232
01:04:03,530 --> 01:04:24,739
Oh, Trump. Oh, Trump. Oh, Trump. Oh, Trump. Cool. All right. I got it. I think that's it. Right.

233
01:04:24,739 --> 01:04:29,989
Did I get it? Please do a funny scream. I'm not. I don't want to scream in the mic. It's going to

234
01:04:29,989 --> 01:04:58,500
hurt somebody's fucking ears. Derma. It hurt my ears every time you say fuck. Does it? You look

235
01:04:58,500 --> 01:05:14,980
like a chicken. What are you going to do with that one? Fucking internet. Deal with that one.

236
01:05:24,309 --> 01:05:45,400
All right. I can't buy anything else. He's, he's high. I'm not. I'm literally not. Cerberus.

237
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:59,980
How long is the game? What's wrong with him today? Nothing's wrong with me today. That's any

238
01:05:59,980 --> 01:06:04,059
different than. Guys, the chicken noise was nominated for like worst sound of the year in

239
01:06:04,059 --> 01:06:17,909
like 2019. I feel like I haven't done that before. Is this, can I stand on this? Okay. For a second,

240
01:06:17,909 --> 01:06:35,079
I can. All right. So I like the, I like this. This is so loud. I like the, um, the coin.

241
01:06:36,039 --> 01:06:39,320
It's hard to hit, but it's fun. So I'm going to do coin and I like these.

242
01:06:39,960 --> 01:06:59,099
I wanted full health. All right. You guys ready? Let's go. Oh, I can't keep them on the green. I

243
01:06:59,099 --> 01:07:13,219
have to swap it. I can't leave it on the green. Oh, okay. It's cute. You can do that in the

244
01:07:13,219 --> 01:07:31,030
settings. Q works. Although if I get sick of Q, I can do a mouse scroll. I'm assuming. Oops.

245
01:07:44,280 --> 01:07:49,269
That's a death. That just looks like a little spinning log that wouldn't kill you.

246
01:07:49,269 --> 01:07:56,119
Why would that kill you? That doesn't hurt. How would that kill you? That was just a spinning

247
01:07:56,119 --> 01:08:24,949
log. Why? How does this kill you? All right. I got a boss already. Attack sound cues allow you to

248
01:08:24,949 --> 01:08:39,689
keep track enemies off screen. This is a boss already. Cyber grind. Not yet. Abandon hope all

249
01:08:40,409 --> 01:08:57,909
who enter here. Oh shit. It's these things. Is it both or just one? Oh, God damn it.

250
01:09:11,579 --> 01:09:42,710
Fuck. All right. I got to get the timings down. I need blood. Damn it. The AOE hurts.

251
01:09:43,430 --> 01:09:50,090
All right. I'm going to swap to this. Let's go. You know what? Let's go like this. I got an idea.

252
01:09:50,970 --> 01:10:05,239
How did I kill this thing instantly before? I killed it instantly. How? I don't understand.

253
01:10:18,699 --> 01:12:43,060
Fuck. Fuck you. Fuck off. Why am I crying? Holy shit. That was crazy. Jesus. You need to

254
01:12:43,060 --> 01:12:51,189
put a shawl on you, old lady. Use the slide. I keep using shift instead of control. I keep going

255
01:12:53,289 --> 01:13:00,260
like this. This is actually the dash, but it lasts way longer and covers way more surface area.

256
01:13:01,510 --> 01:13:10,489
I keep trying to eye frame dodge. This is fun. I like it. Why is chat being so mean today? Because

257
01:13:10,489 --> 01:13:14,810
I haven't been around for five days. They've boiled up like five days worth of insults.

258
01:13:15,449 --> 01:13:34,039
Wait, anything else I missed? I don't think so. It was actually six days. Thanks for keeping track,

259
01:13:34,600 --> 01:13:42,630
but I actually hate you. I'm just trying to find something you like, you enjoy, it makes you happy,

260
01:13:42,630 --> 01:13:51,500
man. Find something that you like. Don't watch me because you hate me. Don't hate me. Find

261
01:13:51,500 --> 01:14:03,260
something you enjoy doing. Hating you makes me happy. Well, I don't know what to tell you.

262
01:14:08,819 --> 01:14:13,819
Nothing new. I'm starting to get the hang of it though. I'm starting to understand.

263
01:14:13,819 --> 01:14:22,810
I almost want to switch. I almost want to switch control and shift. I feel like I would

264
01:14:22,810 --> 01:14:34,779
because hitting it with my pinky kind of hurts. This is nice. I don't know if there's something

265
01:14:34,779 --> 01:15:11,189
in there. There's a coin in the fountain. Where? Well, that's very specific. Okay. I guess we're

266
01:15:11,189 --> 01:15:25,350
going down here. What? Complete the level in under 10 seconds. I could do that. Just run and do the

267
01:15:26,229 --> 01:15:40,600
well. So now what? You found a secret mission. What did, what do I do? Um, okay. This is on.

268
01:15:45,510 --> 01:16:26,149
Oh, okay. How's that wrong? What do I do? What is this? Okay. Don't touch that one.

269
01:16:42,060 --> 01:16:49,819
Easy. There's way more of these. All right. Let's fucking go. Let's go. Ultra kill. Ultra

270
01:16:49,819 --> 01:17:35,670
kill. AKA the witness. Back it up. Back it up. Back it up. No, I didn't mean to. Whatever. I'm

271
01:17:35,670 --> 01:19:18,699
not supposed to scream. I got it. Stop. What more of this bullshit? I don't get it. Oh, I can do

272
01:19:18,699 --> 01:19:26,260
that. I get it. Okay. I was going to say, how's that possible? All right. Open the door. Oh God.

273
01:19:27,060 --> 01:19:41,260
There's more. All right. I got it. We're going to do this quick. Is it a tweet from the dev?

274
01:19:46,739 --> 01:19:55,109
I'll have to look at it in a minute. All right. Wait. So the, so red and blue can both touch

275
01:19:55,109 --> 01:20:18,460
white. I'm assuming, right? What are you talking about? Wait, they can't? What? What? Why? What the

276
01:20:18,460 --> 01:20:27,029
fuck? Huh? How old are you? You, you don't, you didn't get both red the first, but do I, um,

277
01:20:27,029 --> 01:20:33,560
this is a new mechanic. Everybody call me a dumb ass. It's a brand new mechanic. I haven't seen

278
01:20:34,359 --> 01:20:40,439
what, why would I know this immediately? I'm asking a simple question. I've gotten this far

279
01:20:40,439 --> 01:21:29,100
in five minutes. Okay. So, okay. So I was right. Guys, what? How would I, how do you do this one?

280
01:21:34,439 --> 01:21:41,539
Cause I can't, I can't go either one of these directions. Can I? I'll come back to that one.

281
01:21:41,539 --> 01:22:10,090
This is an iPad game. I'm fine. How would I do this? So this, okay. This has to go here. This

282
01:22:10,090 --> 01:23:51,350
has to go here. Okay. How do I get that one? How do I get the top left one? Blue has to go. Okay. So

283
01:23:51,350 --> 01:24:14,710
blue has to go this way, but what the fuck? How do I do this? Blue hat? No help. Like, does that

284
01:24:14,710 --> 01:24:28,439
work? Yeah. Okay. I don't, I, I don't know why my brain was saying that the white balls had to be

285
01:24:28,439 --> 01:24:32,380
touched by each of the three colors. I didn't. Yeah. Okay. All right. What was this one again?

286
01:24:32,939 --> 01:24:41,779
Yeah, this one's weird. So now that I got that, that one's easy. All right. Now I understand. Okay.

287
01:24:41,779 --> 01:25:23,619
Let's go. What? Oh, why is that wrong? Oh, fuck. I didn't mean it to click that. All right. One

288
01:25:23,619 --> 01:26:19,130
more. That was the easiest one. No, no, wrong. It's this. Wait, what if this just does that?

289
01:26:19,130 --> 01:27:56,949
Right? Do I, I don't have to do any bullshit, right? Fuck. Shit. It's close. Got it. Testament

290
01:27:56,949 --> 01:28:02,489
two, failure after failure after failure. Results refuse to alter again and again and again and

291
01:28:02,489 --> 01:28:13,750
again and again and again and again and again. And my faith begins to falter. Now what? That was

292
01:28:13,750 --> 01:28:21,050
nice. That was actually kind of fun. Those puzzles were cool. I mean, that's, I liked it. That was

293
01:28:21,050 --> 01:28:37,029
fun. It was called the witness. Oh, the witless. Okay. Wait, what happened? What does that mean?

294
01:28:37,670 --> 01:29:02,359
Did I get any points for that? This is a dev tweet. Where's the dev tweet? From the dev. I think more

295
01:29:02,359 --> 01:29:09,609
than anything, I'm surprised that Jerma is actually good at the game. What? Followed by

296
01:29:09,609 --> 01:29:18,819
unprecedented. A streamer is good at one dash S puzzles. I'm so happy he gets through hard puzzles

297
01:29:18,819 --> 01:29:25,880
quick and get stuck on easy ones. It's wonderful. I did a fantastic job. I think I did a fantastic

298
01:29:25,880 --> 01:29:42,869
job. I think I did a fantastic job. Hey, DM me where the fucking secret weapons are. I am good

299
01:29:42,869 --> 01:29:50,390
at the game because I have to prove every so often to all these, all these kids that I am good at

300
01:29:50,390 --> 01:29:56,789
video games and I'm not just like an old lady shuffling along. Nope. And let me show you right

301
01:29:56,789 --> 01:30:42,739
now what I mean by that. Explode. I'll do it with my eyes closed. What the, I, whatever. All right,

302
01:30:42,739 --> 01:30:53,260
that's a cool weapon. How do I use it? Wait. Use the attractor nail guns magnets to form concentrated

303
01:30:53,260 --> 01:31:02,140
orbs of nails that can be moved around using the pull force of other magnets. What are you talking

304
01:31:02,140 --> 01:31:32,500
about? What do these do? Oh, they're magnets. I get it. So you go like this and then that's

305
01:31:32,500 --> 01:32:07,609
a cool gun. I get it. So you stick it on somebody and you just, all right. Okay. Let's, huh? My

306
01:32:07,609 --> 01:32:23,819
fingers are slipping off of my mouse. Headshot. Cool. All right. I need to like pull this thing

307
01:32:23,819 --> 01:32:56,039
out more. Where are they from? Is that it? Where's the rest? Another dev tweet. He's stuck on the

308
01:32:56,039 --> 01:33:01,260
hardest one. This has taken some people like 40 minutes to solve. Yeah. What you don't understand

309
01:33:01,739 --> 01:33:08,699
I came prepared. I'm an iPad gamer. And what that means is I lie in bed like this. You see these?

310
01:33:08,699 --> 01:33:13,189
Let me show you something. This is, let me show you this. Do you see this? Do you see my neck?

311
01:33:13,909 --> 01:33:22,600
The lines on my neck. You see, I have like line, line, line. See? Maybe you can't see because this,

312
01:33:23,239 --> 01:33:32,500
I have lines on my neck and it's because I go like this. You see, I lie in bed with an iPad

313
01:33:34,539 --> 01:33:42,600
and I just, I'm like this for six hours straight. And it gives me these lines here. So I play games

314
01:33:42,600 --> 01:33:48,039
like that. And sometimes I go like this because just like, you know, saliva is coming down.

315
01:33:49,000 --> 01:34:00,899
But for the most part, dev said, you do DMS aren't open. Yeah, I know. No, I don't have my DMS open.

316
01:34:01,699 --> 01:34:08,180
I, I would never have my DMS open. Do you understand? I would wake up every morning

317
01:34:08,260 --> 01:34:15,939
and they would be 99 plus sign next to that little thing on Twitter. And then just be like,

318
01:34:15,939 --> 01:34:18,340
I don't, what the fuck am I going to do about this? It would just be,

319
01:34:18,340 --> 01:34:26,949
people would send the most ridiculous fucked up shit. No way. I skipped a level. I'll go back.

320
01:34:27,590 --> 01:34:50,279
So what do I go from here? I can go up there. Is this a puzzle? What an ego? No, I'm, I'm,

321
01:34:50,279 --> 01:34:53,479
it's not an ego. I'm literally telling you real life. Like that's just what happens.

322
01:34:55,939 --> 01:35:01,770
Are you trying to tell me really, really? So you're trying to tell me that one of,

323
01:35:01,770 --> 01:35:07,930
one of you goofballs in this chat wouldn't be somebody that would just send me 99

324
01:35:07,930 --> 01:35:13,800
plus messages in one day. You don't think that would happen? You don't think that I would wake

325
01:35:13,800 --> 01:35:20,039
up and then one of you would send me two to 3000 messages just, just to make sure that I would see

326
01:35:20,039 --> 01:35:26,520
99 plus? Of course you would. That's not ego. All it takes is one of you to do that.

327
01:35:27,319 --> 01:35:45,739
All right. How do I get up there? He's goofball. I mean, come on, just don't fall. All right. I

328
01:35:45,739 --> 01:35:59,289
got to pay attention. There it is. And here it is. And here you go. Don't scream. It's going to be

329
01:35:59,289 --> 01:36:12,199
loud and it's going to hurt somebody's ears. Took 40 people. What? No, it took, everybody took 40

330
01:36:12,199 --> 01:36:33,640
minutes to whatever the dev said. I don't care. 40 minutes for people to do that. Get off me.

331
01:36:33,640 --> 01:37:02,939
That's a new enemy. I don't know what it does. Holy shit. What's that?

332
01:37:03,420 --> 01:37:34,420
Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bingo. Do one of those custom announcer pack things like

333
01:37:35,220 --> 01:38:00,729
quadra kill, triple kill, pentakill. Wow. That was crazy. Where do I go? Triple kill.

334
01:38:03,560 --> 01:38:06,600
I'm going to give you guys a custom announcer pack. You can put in like, I don't know, like

335
01:38:06,600 --> 01:38:34,789
source games. Where do I go? What? Should I put this down here? Oh shit. I can't leave.

336
01:38:36,819 --> 01:38:45,460
Bugleberry. After every kill it just goes. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. That would be every single line.

337
01:38:45,460 --> 01:39:45,909
So I just, what the fuck happened? What? Guys, guys, how do I do this? How do I do this?

338
01:39:45,909 --> 01:39:55,060
It's important. How do I do this? It needs to be this goes in like this and the game does too.

339
01:39:55,859 --> 01:40:05,579
I need to zoom the whole thing in. Hmm. Interesting. Interesting. Okay. Give me one

340
01:40:05,579 --> 01:40:39,340
sec. Give me one sec. Interesting. Interesting. Very interesting. Incredibly interesting. Okay.

341
01:40:39,340 --> 01:40:59,739
Hold on. Very interesting. I need to macro this because I want it to be this goes in

342
01:41:01,770 --> 01:41:16,939
this. Hold on. I need to lock these. Okay. Guys. Okay. That looks all right,

343
01:41:16,939 --> 01:41:44,409
but I need to make sure this gets a little bigger. Oh, I lost my game capture. That's bad. Okay. So

344
01:41:44,409 --> 01:41:53,909
how do I tie? I got to group these together this way. Hold on. I need to make a new group here.

345
01:41:53,909 --> 01:42:09,270
Hold on. I need to come on. Where is it? Group. Okay. Let's go like this and like this. Group.

346
01:42:11,449 --> 01:42:22,329
Group into a folder. That's fine. Now. Fuck. Hold on. I'll get it. I put the wrong thing in the

347
01:42:22,329 --> 01:42:34,229
folder. Fuck. Hold on. This is going to be worth it. I promise it'll be worth it. Is this the regular

348
01:42:34,229 --> 01:42:40,579
game or is this the zoomed in one? That's right. Okay. That's regular. These are both regular.

349
01:42:40,579 --> 01:42:47,800
So I just need to go like this. It's going to piss a lot of you off, but that's whatever.

350
01:42:47,800 --> 01:42:59,800
Okay. All right. Here we go. I just need to make this a button I can press.

351
01:43:01,380 --> 01:43:12,600
We need to get some music. We need to get very important music. Hold on. I got to get my stream

352
01:43:12,600 --> 01:43:46,340
deck. Okay. We're looking for, just put a source here. Source. And this is going to be, uh, the

353
01:43:46,340 --> 01:44:02,539
fuck. Come on. I need to, come on. I'm not Googling how to do it. Streaming. No, I don't want it to be

354
01:44:02,539 --> 01:44:11,109
a fucking scene. Okay. Here we go. All right. I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm very close to being ready.

355
01:44:11,109 --> 01:44:45,300
You have no idea how close I am. Can I get it? Let's get a countdown here. Okay. What the fuck?

356
01:44:45,300 --> 01:44:59,819
What am I supposed to do? Guys, a blue flash means an attack is unperiable. What does that mean?

357
01:45:00,619 --> 01:45:10,329
Whoa. A guy. Hold on. Watch out. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got to get this kill.

358
01:45:10,970 --> 01:45:43,270
Got to get this kill. Got to get this kill. Oh, I died. Shoot. Wait, wait. This is going to get

359
01:45:43,270 --> 01:45:59,079
better. I promise. You don't need to edit it. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I just,

360
01:45:59,079 --> 01:46:06,409
I'm having trouble. I'm having trouble understanding where to go. I think it's the guys.

361
01:46:06,409 --> 01:46:15,529
Is it this way? What happened here? Why is this place on fire? What? I think what I'm going to

362
01:46:15,529 --> 01:46:27,960
have to do is go down this way. Oh, bad guy. Bad guy alert. Bad guy alert. Whoa. It's all right.

363
01:46:27,960 --> 01:46:50,229
We got him guys. Maybe I'll try the shotgun for this. Oh, get absolutely lit up. Okay. So I think

364
01:46:50,229 --> 01:47:19,720
I'm going to stop for a sec. Where is this even playing from? Is this still playing? No. Okay.

365
01:47:19,720 --> 01:47:37,159
We're good. So where do I go from here? We need more. We'll do more later. Okay. I'll do more

366
01:47:37,159 --> 01:48:04,739
later. This is an elevator. This is red. Red, right? So what's the problem? Where do I go?

367
01:48:06,010 --> 01:48:11,689
Take the red skull with you. But isn't this a red platform? Oh, it's, I got the red skull from here.

368
01:48:11,689 --> 01:48:23,859
Sorry. I was doing a thing. Sorry. Where's the red? All right. Sorry. I was doing a thing.

369
01:48:53,479 --> 01:50:00,810
Hell yeah. Supreme. Nice. Can we get a German 985 break court remix? Nope. Oh, that's it. I'm

370
01:50:00,810 --> 01:50:25,109
really good at the kills. Oh, I can go lower. I'll fire while shooting to overheat it. Let me try.

371
01:50:31,689 --> 01:50:48,069
Whoa. Holy shit. Wait, how much has to recharge? So you shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot. I like it.

372
01:50:48,069 --> 01:50:54,300
Thanks for making me laugh, E-clown. Hey, that's what I'm here for. That's what I'm here for. I'm

373
01:50:54,300 --> 01:51:06,649
here to make balloon animals split color doors only require one skull to open. If you do not

374
01:51:06,649 --> 01:51:21,020
seek hardship, stay indoors. Okay. So I only need one checkpoint. That's definitely a boss killer.

375
01:51:21,020 --> 01:51:49,590
I would say you block that either blocking that block that, you know, I keep thinking there's a

376
01:51:49,590 --> 01:52:42,300
double jump and it just isn't there's a dash statistic, ultra ultra brain, the head in the

377
01:52:42,300 --> 01:53:02,890
head in the head. What's next? Please scream ultra. I don't want to hurt anybody's ears.

378
01:53:02,890 --> 01:54:20,710
Oh my God. I'm going to die again down here. Fuck you. Ah, just to save it. Save, save it.

379
01:54:20,710 --> 01:55:21,989
You piece of shit. I need help. Where is he? Fuck out of here. That was crazy. Ultra ultra.

380
01:55:38,869 --> 01:57:53,899
I need that help. No, give me the blood. Jesus. Okay. That was tough. What the fuck?

381
01:57:53,899 --> 01:58:15,779
Honest to God, what happened? What? What's going on? Do I have to do this again? What happened?

382
01:58:15,779 --> 01:59:34,329
I need help. I don't understand what happened. I really don't get it. Can I leave? I can't leave.

383
01:59:34,329 --> 01:59:53,399
You stupid. I don't want to do it again. There's not enough blood to go around whatever it is.

384
01:59:55,750 --> 02:00:11,050
Dude. Oh my fucking God. Dude. I'm going to rip this fucking thing off. My. Okay. My keyboard.

385
02:00:11,770 --> 02:00:16,170
You know what they need to make? God damn it. If you're a manufacturer of like gamer

386
02:00:16,170 --> 02:00:21,210
peripherals, we don't need keyboards. Stop making keyboards. Stop making new keyboards.

387
02:00:21,210 --> 02:00:33,430
No, make a gamer little mini thing. Let me, let me collect myself. A place for me to put

388
02:00:33,430 --> 02:00:38,869
my keyboard. That's not like a piece of shit. I need a place for my keyboard. That's not like

389
02:00:38,869 --> 02:00:43,350
connected to the desk. I need like a little separate desk for the keyboard that I can move

390
02:00:43,350 --> 02:00:49,029
around and is customizable. You know what I mean? These like slide outs, they only slide out so far

391
02:00:49,029 --> 02:00:55,159
and I can't go, I can't get in there. I need another desk that's underneath this desk. That's

392
02:00:55,159 --> 02:01:05,579
like a whole keyboard desk. Do you understand what I'm saying? Cause this under the slider thing,

393
02:01:05,579 --> 02:01:23,859
it goes out so far and then I can't get it out even more. I hate it. I'm going to rip it out.

394
02:01:23,859 --> 02:01:51,939
I'm going to rip it out. I'm no, you're in your thirties. You can't do that. Stop. I need blood

395
02:01:51,939 --> 02:02:00,680
right now. I need blood right now. Oh, that's not going to give me any blood. I just got,

396
02:02:00,680 --> 02:02:47,880
I got rid of more blood. No, don't you dare. I need fucking blood, man. Okay. My goodness.

397
02:02:47,880 --> 02:02:52,039
Now don't mess it up. So I don't want to go here. I don't, I'm not going in here again.

398
02:02:52,039 --> 02:03:10,180
I'm not going in there. What's the, I have to go that way. What? I thought there was a,

399
02:03:10,180 --> 02:03:16,899
there's two doors. There's a blue door and a, and a red door or something. Right. I have to go this

400
02:03:16,899 --> 02:03:25,220
way. Wait, where's the, where was that? Right. There was like, Oh, blue door. And then you only

401
02:03:25,220 --> 02:03:59,220
need one, right? You only need one skull. So I can just go back. Yeah. There it is. Walk into it.

402
02:03:59,220 --> 02:04:25,340
Okay. I'm dead. Well, whatever. Where am I? Oh, it's something about it is making me fucking angry.

403
02:04:59,109 --> 02:05:01,909
What the fuck? It's everything just moves so fast.

404
02:05:19,340 --> 02:05:33,560
What the, I need fucking blood. What the fuck? I can't, I don't even, I can't even tell where

405
02:05:33,560 --> 02:05:59,859
anything even is. This looks like you know what? No, it doesn't. Oh my fuck. This guy's the whole

406
02:05:59,859 --> 02:06:46,390
screen. He, this area is just, get off me. Get out of the fucking way. I'm going to eat it.

407
02:06:46,390 --> 02:07:09,180
Give me this fucking keyboard. You know what it is? I figured it out. Gamers, my arm rests,

408
02:07:09,180 --> 02:07:17,510
my arm rests are at the point where the tray comes out and is hitting the arm rests. This,

409
02:07:17,510 --> 02:07:27,079
I, I need this to be an, I don't want arm rests on my chair. Like this is, feels weird. Now

410
02:07:30,470 --> 02:07:36,470
these big ass arm rests, I feel like I'm sitting in a law firm taking fucking calls for clients.

411
02:07:36,470 --> 02:07:52,489
Get these things out of here. I don't want arm rests. Now I feel like I'm tiny. I hate this.

412
02:07:54,010 --> 02:08:22,250
I'm in the right spot, but I feel like I'm small. I'm so mad. God, I want to unlock the camera.

413
02:08:22,250 --> 02:08:36,100
You fucking idiot. I'm so, oh, I'm so flustered. Okay. Are we good? Okay. I, this feels strange

414
02:08:36,100 --> 02:08:40,630
though. I feel like I'm sitting at like a high, like a high chair. Okay. Check this out. Watch

415
02:08:40,630 --> 02:08:43,510
this games. I'm going to do good now. Ready? One, three, one, four, one, three, four, one, two,

416
02:08:43,510 --> 02:09:34,649
three, go. Oops. Oh, shut up. It's such bullshit. It's a, it's so dumb. It's a stupid fuck the

417
02:09:34,649 --> 02:10:23,529
coins. Why am I even using them? That was so much blood. How come I get the fuck off me?

418
02:10:23,529 --> 02:10:30,890
You gotta be fucking kidding me. This whole area is too small. Oh my God. The area is too small.

419
02:10:45,979 --> 02:11:03,220
Shoot him. Shoot him. Oh my God. Shoot. Well, I jumped over it. Oh my God. I don't know what,

420
02:11:03,220 --> 02:12:08,869
I don't know what it is about this. I fucking hate this. Oh my God. I need help. Get out of the

421
02:12:08,869 --> 02:12:52,119
fucking way. I'm in his body. God. I can't, why did I not get any blood for that? Oh my God. I

422
02:12:52,119 --> 02:13:09,460
feel like I'm fucking way over the thing. How am I not? How's it not getting blood on me? Okay.

423
02:13:09,460 --> 02:13:21,000
How am I not getting? I honestly feel like I'm like, I'm looking down at this big explosion

424
02:13:21,000 --> 02:14:20,659
and I get hit by it. I feel like it happens every day. What the fuck are you talking about?

425
02:14:21,460 --> 02:14:35,779
How am I supposed to avoid that? Oh, that was stupid. This is so fucking hard. This is so hard.

426
02:14:37,500 --> 02:15:07,619
This is so hard. I hit space. Don't be that close. Dude, I can't even fucking see

427
02:15:07,619 --> 02:15:15,619
man. This is fucking crazy. Shut this off. You know what? Just get this like,

428
02:15:53,979 --> 02:17:03,110
don't you fucking dare. That's fucking hard. This game's really hard. I don't even want to.

429
02:17:04,229 --> 02:17:28,219
Okay. That was fun. That's fun. That was actually really fun. You know what I'm saying though?

430
02:17:28,219 --> 02:17:32,540
I, I need something for my desk. I need another second desk that's underneath that like goes like

431
02:17:33,500 --> 02:17:37,290
and then comes out into the keyboard and I can put it wherever I want.

432
02:17:38,920 --> 02:17:44,040
It's always the keyboard is under the desk and sometimes that's not in an ideal location.

433
02:17:46,170 --> 02:17:53,430
Sometimes that's not an ideal location. Hold on. Sorry. How's this up? What's still alive?

434
02:17:54,149 --> 02:18:08,280
Put it on top. No, because then you end up like this. It's like, it hurts my wrist. Only boomers

435
02:18:08,280 --> 02:18:25,159
put their keyboards in the desk tray. It's not in a desk tray, man. It's not a desk tray. We got a

436
02:18:25,159 --> 02:18:37,799
new tweet from the dev. What does it say? We'll find out. Says, I don't see it. We have a tweet

437
02:18:37,799 --> 02:19:02,459
from the dev. What does it say? It looks weird. Whatever. Yeah. It's uh, at Hakita dev. Whatever.

438
02:19:02,459 --> 02:19:18,180
It's fine. Why am I laughing like butt head? That was funny. There's only world one. I'm never going

439
02:19:18,180 --> 02:20:04,469
to beat this game. I know that music. Have I heard this music? Hey, this one's for you, man.

440
02:20:04,469 --> 02:20:22,020
Claire de Lune. It's all right. Bring it on. Forgive me. Do I have to do anything about this?

441
02:20:22,579 --> 02:20:33,370
Turn this shit up. I don't know. There could have been something down here. All right, let's go.

442
02:20:34,250 --> 02:20:51,930
I need three blue skulls to open that door. Let's go. Pick up to read. Somebody else can

443
02:20:51,930 --> 02:21:36,979
read this. This one doesn't open. Okay. What's that? Whatever you are, you're about to get.

444
02:21:37,620 --> 02:22:46,500
Wacked. V2. Fuck. Oh, where'd you go? Huh? Where'd you go? I don't understand.

445
02:23:58,889 --> 02:24:45,780
No. I'm never going to win. I'm never going to win. Try jumping. I've been in the air 50% of the

446
02:24:45,780 --> 02:25:05,159
time. Dude. Holy shit, man. I, why the, I, what do you want me to do? This game. This game. I'm

447
02:25:05,159 --> 02:25:08,840
telling this game's fucking hard. Why am I different? I'm in a different language. I'm

448
02:25:08,840 --> 02:25:13,000
speaking a different language or something, Mike. I don't know what this is. I'm speaking

449
02:25:13,000 --> 02:26:29,909
a different fucking language, Mike. Come on. Get closer. The guy is flying around the map and

450
02:26:29,909 --> 02:26:38,149
dropping missiles everywhere. I don't, there's no get closer reliability here. He's very fast.

451
02:26:38,870 --> 02:26:44,229
I can, he's very small and I just got point blank and didn't get any blood on me apparently. So I

452
02:26:44,229 --> 02:27:23,319
don't get to win. I got a better idea. I got it. It's gotta be this. That's the closest I got with

453
02:27:23,319 --> 02:28:22,840
this. Not too much. I get halfway and I'm just like exhausted. I get halfway and I get exhausted.

454
02:28:22,840 --> 02:29:51,059
I get halfway and I get fucking exhausted. Come here. Where'd he go? Where'd he go? I was fucking

455
02:29:51,059 --> 02:30:01,850
freaking out. I was actually freaking out. It's just, I get exhausted. I can't, my brain goes

456
02:30:01,850 --> 02:30:04,489
like, all right, man, that's enough. There's no humans are supposed to be doing this.

457
02:30:05,209 --> 02:30:09,579
You know what fucking humans are supposed to be doing? Humans are supposed to be fucking picking

458
02:30:09,579 --> 02:30:14,940
up like a wheelbarrow full of like logs and just like slowly walking with it. And then,

459
02:30:14,940 --> 02:30:20,299
and delivering those logs to the community. And then like those logs are used to build houses.

460
02:30:20,299 --> 02:30:24,940
And then there's also like a baker and like a butcher and no humans aren't supposed to be

461
02:30:24,940 --> 02:30:29,260
doing what we're doing right now. Humans aren't supposed to be doing this. Like we're supposed

462
02:30:29,260 --> 02:30:32,780
to be like, oh, howdy, how are you? Good to see you. We're not supposed to be like,

463
02:30:38,309 --> 02:30:43,190
humans are supposed to be like, we're supposed to be fucking relaxing with each other and having a

464
02:30:43,190 --> 02:30:57,479
good time and taking care of the community. It's amish. It's not amish, man. Just humans

465
02:30:57,479 --> 02:31:09,059
are not supposed to be doing this. Guys, when Ben Franklin was writing up the goddamn fucking

466
02:31:09,059 --> 02:31:14,500
Declaration of Independence, there was no guggity guggity in there. There was no, oh yeah, we also

467
02:31:14,500 --> 02:31:19,540
need to make sure to leave some room for guggity guggity guggity guggity guggity. There's no room

468
02:31:19,540 --> 02:31:39,479
for that, Ben. Quaker Oats Guy? What are you talking about? What do you mean? What are you

469
02:31:39,479 --> 02:31:43,879
talking about? Why are you saying Quaker Oats Guy? What do you mean the Quaker Oats Guy? I don't

470
02:31:43,879 --> 02:31:48,440
know what that reference is referencing. What are you referencing? I don't know what you're talking

471
02:31:48,440 --> 02:32:10,090
about. No, there was no time for guggity guggity. I just beat it. I just beat it. Oh, all right.

472
02:32:10,090 --> 02:32:24,969
Oh shit. Which one of these has been here longer? Oh, this one. The Quaker Oats Andy? What did that

473
02:32:24,969 --> 02:32:36,500
do? You know, humans are supposed to be just like, it is amish. Fucking really is amish.

474
02:32:37,379 --> 02:32:44,260
We're supposed to be like cutting wood and like growing beards and like, oh yeah, absolutely.

475
02:32:44,260 --> 02:32:49,379
I'm the builder. I'm the butcher. I'm the banker. I'm supposed to be sitting here at this shit.

476
02:32:50,260 --> 02:33:06,389
I got a D. The Quaker guy is calling at 3 a.m. We're supposed to be

477
02:33:09,989 --> 02:33:20,299
holding up. Okay. Shockwave. Okay. Can that do it? Can this do anything different?

478
02:33:21,510 --> 02:33:38,139
Okay. But there's no Amish bankers. You know what I mean though? I hope so that how does that do?

479
02:33:38,139 --> 02:33:51,049
Boom. Okay. The Quaker Oats Guy pretty much hated everything. Fun. Wait, really? Why are we calling

480
02:33:51,049 --> 02:33:58,760
him the Quaker Oats Guy, by the way? What's that guy's name? The Quaker Oats Guy. You don't know

481
02:33:58,760 --> 02:34:09,750
that. It's a Quaker. What's a Quaker? I know a Quaker is something in something out. What is it?

482
02:34:09,750 --> 02:34:20,180
His name was William Penn. He sucked. He sucked, dude. No, you don't want to know this guy. He

483
02:34:20,180 --> 02:34:48,459
sucked. Oh, he sucked, dude. All right. How do I get out of here? Derma failed 10th grade. No,

484
02:34:48,459 --> 02:34:57,420
I didn't fail 10th grade. I just haven't been in 10th grade in 20 years. I don't wake up in the

485
02:34:57,420 --> 02:35:02,540
morning and go, oh, William Penn, the Quaker. He was a Quaker and he hated fun and he sucked.

486
02:35:02,540 --> 02:35:10,059
I don't do that. I'm an adult. I don't think about school or history books. What are you talking

487
02:35:10,059 --> 02:35:45,930
about? What are you on about? This guy's on something. Whatever. Whoa. Weren't you a teacher?

488
02:35:45,930 --> 02:35:53,139
I wasn't a teacher. Guys, I think you severely underestimate what a substitute teacher is doing.

489
02:36:11,829 --> 02:36:37,479
Oh, that was a big one. Ego Maniac says everybody underestimates his work. Now that I was saying the

490
02:36:37,479 --> 02:36:55,610
opposite of what you're thinking. Okay. We're good. Oh, shut up. Not you guys. This guy.

491
02:36:58,780 --> 02:37:08,020
What are you? Could I have survived? What's going on? What's going on? What happened? I'm fine.

492
02:37:08,659 --> 02:37:13,610
I'm alive. No, dude. What the fuck happened? I freaked out because I was. Okay. Wait, wait,

493
02:37:13,610 --> 02:37:56,780
wait, wait. Don't freak out. Nobody's nobody's nobody here. I saw an orb. We're dead.

494
02:38:13,100 --> 02:39:32,250
Are you fucking kidding me? Where is he? Shut up. Oh my God. Okay. We're good. Thankfully,

495
02:39:32,250 --> 02:39:42,920
this check my writer. Oh man. This is going to be hard. It's hard, man. It's hard to do this.

496
02:39:43,559 --> 02:39:47,000
It's so easy to still like bunk bunk bunk bunk bunk bunk bunk bunk bunk jump jump jump.

497
02:40:01,139 --> 02:40:11,139
Can I not do that with this thing? I don't think I can do it with this thing. Okay. Let's get up

498
02:40:11,139 --> 02:41:01,030
there. Oh, I don't want to use that thing. That thing sucks. I touched it. What the fuck? What?

499
02:41:01,030 --> 02:41:35,559
Okay. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Who's left? We're good. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,

500
02:41:35,559 --> 02:42:25,690
dude. I got it. I got it. I just scared the shit out of myself. I looked over here. Whoa. Look at

501
02:42:25,690 --> 02:42:49,690
that. What are you doing? Was I supposed to do that? I think so. Okay. I got it. You have a

502
02:42:49,690 --> 02:43:05,780
runny nose. Whatever. That was hard. This dude is going insane. That was this epic high octane

503
02:43:05,780 --> 02:43:10,100
gameplay. Wondering when the stream of Ratchet and Clank is coming for the PS2. I don't like

504
02:43:10,100 --> 02:43:28,229
any of those games. They're not for me. I'm okay. Ratchet and Clank, Jack and Daxter. I don't

505
02:43:28,229 --> 02:43:34,780
really play them. I didn't really care. I know. I'm sorry. But it's true. I didn't really care.

506
02:43:35,579 --> 02:43:45,129
It's not that I think they're bad. I just really didn't get into it. These guys have guns.

507
02:43:51,420 --> 02:45:05,459
Who else is left? Where is this person? Secret? No. Give me the shotgun. Yep. No, I'm not going to

508
02:45:05,459 --> 02:45:12,979
play. I don't know if I'm going to play Sly Cooper either. Oh, wait. Did I have to do I have to power

509
02:45:12,979 --> 02:45:21,459
it or something? Why is the music so weird? Because it's an intense game. Well, what do I have to do?

510
02:45:22,180 --> 02:46:11,379
Is there another one of these? Oh, of course. Okay. Ultra Kill is so good. This game is really good.

511
02:46:12,180 --> 02:46:41,299
It's really intense. All right, there's one more. Where is it? Over there? Yo, where's this last one?

512
02:46:41,860 --> 02:46:54,780
I don't know. Where's this last one? There's one down there, one over here.

513
02:46:55,659 --> 02:47:11,299
So where's the other one? Follow the line. One, two, that one leads to here.

514
02:47:12,100 --> 02:47:55,180
I got this one. So then this one leads this way. What? What? Headshot. Come on. Oh my goodness.

515
02:47:55,180 --> 02:48:41,190
You're here. Checkpoint. All right. Those guys melt wicked fast. Oh, it's trying to be cheeky

516
02:48:41,190 --> 02:49:04,180
with it. I'm trying to slide up the whole thing. Only the feedbacker can parry projectiles. Yeah.

517
02:49:04,180 --> 02:49:41,930
All right. Why parry? You can just fucking annihilate them like that. Whoa. What's that?

518
02:49:41,930 --> 02:49:48,120
Hey, it zooms in. Recharges even when unequipped. Switch weapons to keep fighting between shots.

519
02:49:49,180 --> 02:50:35,530
Oh, shotgun. Shotgun is the best. All right. There's one power. There's a power over here.

520
02:50:38,329 --> 02:51:25,500
Power. Uh-oh. Wow. Get out of here. All right. I need one more of those electricity things.

521
02:51:25,500 --> 02:52:00,360
Holy shit. I need some. Look. Look. Look at us. What? I'm concentrating. I'm concentrating.

522
02:52:01,000 --> 02:52:12,860
Shoot the coins with the rail gun. I ain't reading that shit. Why does he look like this? I don't

523
02:52:12,860 --> 02:52:25,290
know, dude. I don't know what you're talking. What do you want me to say? Shoot the wall. Oh,

524
02:52:25,290 --> 02:52:52,629
this one. You mean, cool. All right. Where's the last electricity? Don't even fucking think

525
02:52:52,629 --> 02:53:02,440
about it, bro. What? No way, dude. What are you talking about? You shitting me. Fuck. Bad.

526
02:53:14,139 --> 02:53:20,409
Stupid. That was so stupid. Before you die in the game, honest to God, this is like what I don't

527
02:53:20,409 --> 02:53:30,229
like about games now, seriously. When I get to zero, it should go 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3,

528
02:53:30,229 --> 02:53:35,270
2, 1, and then go to zero and then I die. And if I get one hit on anybody, it refills me to a

529
02:53:35,270 --> 02:53:40,600
hundred percent. Like that's so fucking annoying. Like why? It's like, God, they don't make them

530
02:53:40,600 --> 02:54:17,719
like they used to. You know what I mean? All right. That's two. The last one's down here.

531
02:54:19,110 --> 02:54:56,469
Somewhere. All right. Wow. Somebody said, it looks like he's high on psychedelics.

532
02:54:57,270 --> 02:55:20,819
I'm just like sitting here, just like freaking out. Oh, that's funny. Whoa. Screwdriver malicious.

533
02:55:21,540 --> 02:55:30,299
I don't know. How much P do I have? Definitely not enough. Dude, you're just like rolling right

534
02:55:30,299 --> 02:55:43,590
now. What the fuck, dude? What? This is insane. This looks fucked and not even real. This is

535
02:55:43,670 --> 02:56:14,219
fucked up. Hold on. What on earth is going on here? Why is this? What are you doing?

536
02:56:15,290 --> 02:56:38,389
Why is it doing that? Why is it doing this? Okay. I didn't want to do that. I don't know. I look

537
02:56:38,389 --> 02:56:47,610
like a different person. That does not even look like me. It looks like a different person.

538
02:56:47,610 --> 02:57:05,930
Cover the cam with that. That's a stupid thing to have there.

539
02:57:06,489 --> 02:57:21,059
What is the sound? Super heart attack. This is okay. This level is called heart attack.

540
02:57:32,819 --> 02:58:06,309
Leave it on so the Twitch thumbnail gets it. All right. Fine. Wait, you mean like do this? How

541
02:58:06,309 --> 02:58:25,059
long does it take to get the thumbnail? How long will it take? A minute. It's going to take five

542
02:58:25,059 --> 03:00:11,319
minutes. I look like fucking 70. I look 70 years old. Watch out. It's there. It's just two minutes.

543
03:00:11,719 --> 03:00:28,200
It's there. Do we have a screen cap? It's not there yet. Well, why are you lying? Put a webcam on

544
03:00:28,200 --> 03:00:58,899
the bottom of that. You want to put my webcam. Hold on. Oh, I got a blue. Where do I bring this?

545
03:00:58,899 --> 03:01:34,100
Where do I bring this? Isn't there another pedestal somewhere? That's red here. This is red.

546
03:01:34,739 --> 03:02:22,069
Where do I put it? Shit. Where does this go? Into the water? Jesus. Can you drown? I can't drown,

547
03:02:22,069 --> 03:02:52,760
right? Where's the blue door? Where's the blue door? It's there. All right. Let me see. We don't

548
03:02:52,760 --> 03:03:17,510
need this anymore. There we go. Okay. Hey, we're back to normal. People are going to click on that

549
03:03:17,510 --> 03:03:24,889
and just not the kind of understand what's going on. I know I'm not keeping it. No. All right. So

550
03:03:24,889 --> 03:03:43,620
where where do I put this stupid thing? Where do I put this dumb thing? It's underwater.

551
03:03:44,870 --> 03:04:13,819
We're underwater. There's nothing here. Oh, fine. Bring it back. It's not there. Yes, it is.

552
03:04:16,600 --> 03:04:41,110
Yes, it is. I can prove it. I can prove that it's there. I have a screenshot right now. So this is

553
03:04:41,110 --> 03:04:59,110
what it looks like when you go to this category. Why is it so huge? Why is it so huge? Groggy Gary.

554
03:04:59,110 --> 03:05:14,100
Groggy Gary makes it sound like I'm just zonked. That's what that means. Hold on. Why is it so

555
03:05:14,100 --> 03:05:29,100
stretched out? What does the three mean? What is the three? Is that how long? It's been three

556
03:05:29,100 --> 03:05:56,870
minutes. It's been three hours. Oh, okay. Make this the thumbnail. No, dude. What the fuck?

557
03:06:04,940 --> 03:06:23,000
Okay. I need the judges like this. Crop this. And dude, cropping this is going to take an extra.

558
03:06:44,889 --> 03:06:53,659
What? What is that? What the fuck is that? What did that say? Why did that just say something?

559
03:06:53,659 --> 03:07:05,370
That's my name. What was that? What was that? What was that? What happened? Yeah. But wait,

560
03:07:05,370 --> 03:07:12,700
if this is the thumbnail, won't it just be the fucking thumbnail? I'm so confused by this because

561
03:07:13,420 --> 03:07:21,750
won't this just be the thumbnail? We're not doing anything different. It's just nothing's going to

562
03:07:21,750 --> 03:08:10,659
change. Yes, it will. It'll be layered. There'll be two titles. I can't, guys, I can't even see

563
03:08:10,659 --> 03:08:26,940
this. I need to make it a little bigger. Does that work? Am I in the right spot? Am I in the right

564
03:08:26,940 --> 03:09:02,250
spot? If I go right here, is this like this makes sense, right? Okay. All right. Let's go.

565
03:09:02,250 --> 03:09:58,440
Oh, there's a meat grinder right there. Shit. Headshots, headshots. Shit, I wasted it. Okay,

566
03:09:58,440 --> 03:10:18,440
we're good. Good. Good. This gameplay is whoa. Do we get an update? Update? Is it there? What is

567
03:10:18,440 --> 03:10:35,479
what the fuck? This is so weird. This is strange. This is gonna start to get fucking weird, man.

568
03:10:35,479 --> 03:10:56,149
Hold on. No, I just replaced the game capture with a fucking image. Okay, there we go.

569
03:10:56,149 --> 03:11:16,389
Where is it? Oh, it's huge. That's why. What the fuck? What is happening? There it is. This is

570
03:11:16,389 --> 03:11:24,700
fucking insane. Even with like the view count, people are going to think that there's nothing

571
03:11:24,700 --> 03:11:41,989
wrong with their computer. I don't think I can go anymore. Should I put hold on? What if I start

572
03:11:41,989 --> 03:12:01,659
putting it down here? I have an idea. Okay, where's the game? I need the game. All right,

573
03:12:01,659 --> 03:12:24,440
this needs to be ahead of this. Like here, right? And then I need to be here. Like that. Okay. All

574
03:12:24,440 --> 03:12:39,770
right, let's go. I think that should be good. Okay. High pitched voice. What? Pitch up your

575
03:12:39,770 --> 03:12:48,540
voice. Why would that matter? Pitch up? Why would that matter? It's an image. I don't understand.

576
03:12:48,540 --> 03:12:57,139
Just do it, please. I don't get it. Because I'm tiny? But I can't. You don't understand. I can't

577
03:12:57,139 --> 03:13:03,620
do that. I don't have my GoXLR plugged in anymore. So I can do this, but I don't know if that matters.

578
03:13:04,500 --> 03:13:10,780
It's because I'm tiny. Oh, okay. I see. Watch out. Okay, I'm gonna go this way.

579
03:13:11,579 --> 03:13:45,100
This meatwad. Oh, red. Red, because I'm a Sith Lord. Uh-oh. What is that? Whoa. Where'd it go?

580
03:13:45,100 --> 03:14:04,739
Do the voice. No. Where is he? Holy shit. Did I get him? Get out of the fucking water.

581
03:14:18,459 --> 03:14:27,739
What's he doing? All right. I'm good. Do the voice. I'm not doing the voice.

582
03:14:28,459 --> 03:15:12,569
We got an update. Shit. We got an update. All right. What do we got? This one's a bit better.

583
03:15:12,569 --> 03:15:27,239
Okay. All right. I don't know. How much more of this can we do? Like, look at this shit. Like,

584
03:15:27,239 --> 03:15:33,479
I don't know. How much more can we actually? Well, the viewers keep going up. The viewers

585
03:15:33,479 --> 03:15:39,879
are increasing this whole time. That is so funny. I think that's the funniest part of this is the

586
03:15:39,879 --> 03:15:46,469
fact that the viewers have been going up by what looks like they leased into the thousands. Will

587
03:15:46,469 --> 03:16:01,659
that keep going up? Will that be like 18.5 next time? That's a great question. I have no idea.

588
03:16:08,540 --> 03:16:16,170
Okay. I'm going to move the game capture window again. This one, the game capture can be a little

589
03:16:16,170 --> 03:16:29,479
bit bigger this time, right? Look at, like it can be that. Cam needs to be changed though.

590
03:16:34,969 --> 03:16:50,139
Okay. All right. Let's, is it going to keep going up? All right. Let's go add an I funny watermark.

591
03:16:54,680 --> 03:16:58,040
No, no, I'm, I'm into this right now because I want to see, this is important. I want to see

592
03:16:58,040 --> 03:17:14,180
the viewers keep going up. We're not quite there yet. Put scratches on the screen.

593
03:17:16,170 --> 03:17:24,459
Guys, you're going to have to give me a second. At some point, I'm going to have to react to it

594
03:17:24,459 --> 03:18:30,969
with a big cam. Shit. That's gotta be it. Okay. I think that's good, right? Got it. Yeah. I'm

595
03:18:30,969 --> 03:19:10,280
going to make a clickbait face. I will a hundred thousand. That's so much. Put a red arrow court

596
03:19:10,280 --> 03:19:24,329
of the corpse king. Put a clickbait red circle on it with an arrow. All right. I'll put,

597
03:19:24,329 --> 03:19:38,200
I'll put a big red circle. We've got an update. All right, let's go. There's another one. Let's

598
03:19:38,200 --> 03:19:56,149
go. Did the viewers drop or did it keep going? It's the same 18.2. I need to, okay. I need a,

599
03:19:56,149 --> 03:20:16,100
I need a red circle. Anybody got an image? 18.3. It's 18.3. Oh my God. No, it's 18.2. We're still

600
03:20:16,100 --> 03:20:42,420
there. We're, we're still, it's 18.2. Okay. Now I need a red circle on this. God. Okay. All right.

601
03:20:42,420 --> 03:21:05,399
Now where's the red circle going to go? I need a red circle. I need a, it's an empty circle, right?

602
03:21:05,399 --> 03:21:09,639
Make, put it on your face from two times ago. That's what I was thinking either or the first

603
03:21:09,639 --> 03:21:12,680
month. All right. We're going to do the red, a red transparent circle.

604
03:21:26,059 --> 03:21:58,889
Okay. I'm going to call this circle. Okay. Here it comes. We need to carefully craft this guys.

605
03:22:16,899 --> 03:22:59,139
And I hit an arrow pointing to the circle. Transparent red arrow. Oh my God. Okay. New image.

606
03:23:08,469 --> 03:23:19,700
Shit. This is fucked up. It's not transparent. Why is it not? This is not transparent.

607
03:23:19,700 --> 03:23:54,299
Huh? Hold on. It's got to be transparent. Okay. What the fuck? All right. I'm going to, I'm just

608
03:23:54,299 --> 03:24:03,260
going to get the white out of here, right? Shit. Okay. I got to, I got to, it's a, what do I do?

609
03:24:03,260 --> 03:24:10,170
What do I do? What do I do? What do I do? I got to add a mask, a mask, right? I'm going to key it out.

610
03:24:10,170 --> 03:24:39,399
I'm going to key out. I'm going to key the white out. Okay. Got it. All right. Let's go. Let's go.

611
03:24:39,399 --> 03:24:55,989
Let's go. Let's go. I got to go. I got to go. Let's go. I don't even know what the hell I was

612
03:24:55,989 --> 03:25:05,750
doing in the game. You put Goku on it. No. What? Yeah. After this, I'm going to do a react cam

613
03:25:05,750 --> 03:25:19,290
where it's big and I'm, I'm, wow. Am I fucking concerned? Why would I put Goku on it or put

614
03:25:19,290 --> 03:25:54,950
master chief on it and then react to it? Do I have to go backwards? Is it going to kill me?

615
03:25:54,950 --> 03:26:05,940
Add a red imposter. Okay. I'll add a red imposter and Goku. Okay. What happened? What the fuck? Oh,

616
03:26:05,940 --> 03:26:17,829
that would have been really cool if you had seen that. This is like a crazy fight. Okay. I'm dead,

617
03:26:18,469 --> 03:26:42,819
but is it, is it there? We got an update? Not yet. Okay. I think I have to go backwards. Oh my God.

618
03:26:42,819 --> 03:26:55,590
Okay. I, I think I get it somehow. Oh my God. It's like playing a game up. It's, we got an update.

619
03:26:55,590 --> 03:27:14,700
It's there. All right. Let's go. This is important. Okay. I need, I need a red imposter and Goku. This

620
03:27:14,700 --> 03:27:23,659
is the culmination of the whole joke, by the way. You guys ready? Not yet. What do you mean? Not yet.

621
03:27:25,940 --> 03:27:48,409
I thought it was there. Okay. Okay. Here it comes. I'm going to do this quick. It's not there yet.

622
03:27:48,409 --> 03:27:52,090
Wait, it's actually not there. All right. Wait, wait, wait. I got, I got the images that I need.

623
03:27:52,090 --> 03:27:57,209
I'm ready when it happens. This is the culmination of the whole joke. I'm not going to add any more

624
03:27:57,209 --> 03:28:32,200
yet. Not yet. Oh my God. This is fucking hard. All right. Do I, do I got it? Okay. I need to,

625
03:28:32,200 --> 03:28:40,309
I need a clean image. Oh, you put Goku in that one. No, no, no. Goku's got to go on the top left.

626
03:28:41,270 --> 03:28:54,010
That's not the new one. Wait, what? The mods are putting Goku in already. Oh, that's not the new

627
03:28:54,010 --> 03:29:08,469
one. Okay. Okay. It's still not there. Oh, did I break it? Maybe I just shouldn't be. Okay. I got

628
03:29:08,469 --> 03:29:27,260
an idea. I got to jump over that. I need to get health. Oh, that goes fast. We got an update

629
03:29:27,260 --> 03:29:56,790
because I got to act fast. Let's go. I got to act quick. I got to act quickly. Wait, hold on. This

630
03:29:56,790 --> 03:30:00,389
is going to get messed up because of the, hold on. Wait, wait, wait. This is going to get fucked up.

631
03:30:01,030 --> 03:30:08,969
This is going to get fucked up. Okay. I need to get rid of this. Wait. Yeah. Okay. Get rid of this.

632
03:30:10,090 --> 03:30:13,930
Whoa. It's, we're getting perspective with this. Do you see how weird that looks?

633
03:30:15,340 --> 03:30:34,389
Okay. Goku. Where should he be? Should he be coming up from the bottom? I don't know. Should it be,

634
03:30:34,389 --> 03:30:39,399
should it be the whole thing like that? Like he's kind of looking at the video. He's checking it

635
03:30:39,399 --> 03:30:46,040
out. He's checking out these, his subscription feed like this. And then let's get the imposter

636
03:30:46,040 --> 03:31:07,639
in the top left. Like here. I don't want to get up like right here. And then I need to be like this.

637
03:31:33,319 --> 03:31:56,969
Right. Is that good? Put Miku on the top left. No, no, no. I gotta be looking this way. Right.

638
03:31:56,969 --> 03:32:47,450
Wider. Hold on. Like this. Hold on. Wait. Like this. Right here. I have to do this for a long time.

639
03:32:47,450 --> 03:33:31,819
Don't I? Update. Update. It's there. Do we actually have it? Are you lying? Oh shit. No,

640
03:33:31,819 --> 03:33:53,000
it's not accurate. It's not. No, no, no. It's not right. It's not right. I wait. I need that. I need

641
03:33:53,479 --> 03:33:56,600
this. I need this. I need that. I need that. I need that. I need that. I need this one because

642
03:33:56,600 --> 03:34:03,350
I'm going to look up at it. Oh, we actually, I got it. I got it. We got it. We got it. We actually

643
03:34:03,350 --> 03:34:16,520
got it. We actually got it. It actually did come through. Hold on. Did it actually come through?

644
03:34:16,520 --> 03:34:55,659
Hold on. I need to wait. Are they in the right spot? What the fuck? Hold on. Well,

645
03:34:55,659 --> 03:35:08,520
it says 20K viewers now. Where is it? Fuck. Hold on. I got to get up there. I don't know.

646
03:35:08,520 --> 03:35:37,510
I'm losing track of shit. I think we're going a little too far. I think we're going too far.

647
03:35:37,510 --> 03:36:38,860
Add question mark. Okay. All right. One more after this and I'm done.

648
03:36:38,860 --> 03:37:01,430
Add Saul Goodman. I can't. I'll add Walter White. The one where he's like,

649
03:37:01,430 --> 03:37:17,670
you know what I mean? Did we get it? Update. We got one. All right. I don't know what else to

650
03:37:17,670 --> 03:37:23,899
do with this though. Like, what the fuck is this? Okay. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

651
03:37:23,899 --> 03:37:27,500
There's too many things on the screen. I don't know what's real and what's not real right now.

652
03:37:27,500 --> 03:37:40,059
You know, I don't know what is and isn't real. It's actually kind of hard to figure that out.

653
03:37:40,860 --> 03:37:46,520
Okay. I'm going to go away. Wait, what happened? What happened to the other one?

654
03:37:47,079 --> 03:37:53,079
Wait, this one just got up. No, this is not even an update. This one. What happened to me down here?

655
03:37:53,079 --> 03:37:58,950
What? I'm fucking. I'm so confused. What's going on? This is a different one.

656
03:38:10,920 --> 03:38:25,510
I'll put this here. Okay. Let's add this one. This is all right. I have to stop after this

657
03:38:25,510 --> 03:38:29,670
because I have to go. I have to play a fucking video game guys. I can't just keep adding things.

658
03:38:36,809 --> 03:38:50,780
Um, okay. Was that one more? This is going to be it after this. No more, no more.

659
03:38:50,780 --> 03:39:17,239
Okay. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. No, I don't want to screw it up. I don't

660
03:39:17,239 --> 03:39:22,299
want to screw it up. Hold on. I'm going to make this be transparent in the background. Like he's

661
03:39:22,299 --> 03:39:26,379
like, what the fuck? I can't believe this video. All right. Hold on. I'm going to make him transparent.

662
03:39:26,379 --> 03:40:21,879
Is that good? Where's the game? I lost the game. Okay. I just burped. Isn't there? Wait,

663
03:40:21,879 --> 03:41:03,739
is there another one? All right. This is it. This is the last one. Move the face. Are we good?

664
03:41:03,739 --> 03:41:33,700
Somebody said a worst joke at this point. I kind of don't care. At this point is like,

665
03:41:33,700 --> 03:41:44,299
I have to finish it. I need to add Miku. My lips just stuck together. I've been,

666
03:41:44,299 --> 03:41:58,309
I'll have my mouth open for so long. Okay. I got this. There's a Miku in,

667
03:41:59,270 --> 03:42:21,319
in the mod chat right now that I'm going to use and it's perfect. Okay. We have an update.

668
03:42:21,319 --> 03:42:26,840
There's an update. I got the update. All right. Update is here. We're good. I'm going to add this

669
03:42:26,840 --> 03:42:38,059
one more and then I'm done. We're going to get one more thumbnail at this and I'm done.

670
03:42:38,059 --> 03:42:54,200
What the fuck? Hold on. Where is that? Oh yeah. Walter White needs to be. Oh, it's because Walter

671
03:42:54,200 --> 03:43:02,440
White is already on it. What's going on? Okay. Walter White was already on it. That's why it

672
03:43:02,440 --> 03:43:49,639
was fucked up looking. Okay. I need, um, uh, I'll use that one. I'm not using that one. All right.

673
03:43:49,639 --> 03:43:57,690
Fine. I'll use it. What do I care? But why would this even be on here? Why would this even be on

674
03:43:57,690 --> 03:44:10,090
here? Why would that image be on here? Well, let's find out. Okay. You guys are going to laugh,

675
03:44:10,090 --> 03:44:16,780
but I mean, whatever, I guess we're going to use this one. I'll use both. Fuck it. I don't care.

676
03:44:34,809 --> 03:44:50,950
Okay. Um, and then I'm going to use this one. I think this is going to be the,

677
03:44:50,950 --> 03:45:02,100
this is going to be the end. All right. Let's add that. My OBS is so fucked up right now. It's a

678
03:45:02,100 --> 03:45:12,739
joke. It's such a mess. Okay. Oh, I just need to be transparent because she's going to be like

679
03:45:12,739 --> 03:45:17,750
peeking over. Wait, hold on. Shit. Get it out of the way for in case it takes the thumbnail.

680
03:45:17,750 --> 03:45:31,770
Okay. I need to do some editing on this. I'm going to keep a face here though. So I can make sure

681
03:45:40,379 --> 03:46:56,309
just in case. Okay. She looks kind of fucked up, but I don't, that's okay. I think somebody just

682
03:46:56,309 --> 03:47:06,809
said, why do people watch this? I don't know. I don't know, dude. I don't know. I'm sorry.

683
03:47:06,809 --> 03:48:02,139
What do you, I don't know. Pog face instead. Add your soy pointing meme. Okay. And then we're done.

684
03:48:02,139 --> 03:48:14,569
Update. Do we have an update? And then, okay. Then we're going to add the soy pointing meme.

685
03:48:14,569 --> 03:48:18,809
Is there a, is there a transparent one of those? I don't think I have one. I don't have one of

686
03:48:18,809 --> 03:48:51,299
those. The live is covering my face up here. It's so stupid. God damn it. Where, but I can't. Okay.

687
03:48:51,299 --> 03:49:15,270
We need to move some shit. Um, I don't know where else to put this. I'm running out of things to,

688
03:49:15,270 --> 03:49:26,780
I don't know where to put this fucking thing. Okay. Wait, you, you have this? Oh my goodness.

689
03:49:27,420 --> 03:49:50,809
I'm done. I actually am done after this. We are done after this. This is it. This is the end. Oh

690
03:49:50,809 --> 03:50:13,420
my fucking God. But they're too big. They're so huge. They need to be smaller. They're too big.

691
03:50:13,420 --> 03:50:46,979
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on before it changes. Make them pointed among us.

692
03:50:46,979 --> 03:51:53,059
Better idea. You're right. You're right. You're right. I need, I need an arm. We get it. It's

693
03:51:53,059 --> 03:51:57,799
there. All right. We got it. Got it. Got it. Got it. All right. Let's see. What, what does the

694
03:51:57,799 --> 03:52:05,059
culmination of this whole thing look like? Cause that's it. I'm done. I'm done with this. It's

695
03:52:05,059 --> 03:52:16,899
fucking crazy. Okay. I need to turn everything off. Everything has to go off so we can see what it

696
03:52:16,899 --> 03:52:26,250
actually looks like at the end. Okay. Are you ready for the culmination of what is the thumbnail

697
03:52:26,250 --> 03:52:34,739
right now? Here you go. Welcome to hell. This is what people are seeing. It only took us like an

698
03:52:34,739 --> 03:53:14,459
hour to do this. You can't even see the Miku stuff. Jesus. Okay. That was fun. The best part about

699
03:53:14,459 --> 03:53:26,870
this honestly is the perspective changing. It is everything is flattening. The whole game category

700
03:53:26,870 --> 03:53:38,780
is fucked up. What is going on here? What are you guys doing? What are you guys doing? This is the

701
03:53:38,780 --> 03:53:53,030
all right. What the fuck are you guys doing? This is the ultra kill category right now. Oh boy. Well,

702
03:53:53,030 --> 03:54:03,340
the dev was here. Hopefully. Sorry. We're not playing the game. Okay. It's whatever.

703
03:54:05,299 --> 03:54:11,180
Derma's Odyssey. What is going on? Ultra kill world record. Okay.

704
03:54:22,549 --> 03:54:25,270
All right. You guys come on. All right. Come on. Come on.

705
03:54:29,420 --> 03:54:34,260
That's you're not even in the right category. You don't even in the right category. All right.

706
03:54:34,260 --> 03:54:42,840
All right. Let's get out of here. You're in the wrong category. You guys cut the shit. Okay.

707
03:54:42,840 --> 03:54:57,059
Where's the game? All right. That was very interesting. What is this? Oh my goodness.

708
03:54:57,700 --> 03:55:17,110
I have to navigate through all this shit on my hold on. Oh my God. Can somebody get me a decent

709
03:55:17,110 --> 03:55:28,459
screenshot of that so I can put it on here because I can't follow through Twitter. Where's the actual

710
03:55:28,459 --> 03:55:36,540
camera? I don't know where it went. Okay. There's the cam. Let me just let me go one by one here

711
03:55:36,540 --> 03:55:48,409
and get this fixed. What? How long have I been sitting here for? Why does this look weird?

712
03:55:48,409 --> 03:55:53,030
Something's off about this camera now. Why? Something's weird about it. Is it squished

713
03:55:53,030 --> 03:56:15,420
or something? Something's off, right? Something's off. Is that better? I think I fixed it.

714
03:56:16,059 --> 03:56:34,540
Was my head that long? I actually don't know. I think I got it. Okay. We're in a good spot.

715
03:56:34,540 --> 03:56:50,149
Now I need the game back. Just the video game, wherever it is. Okay. Oh, that's not right. All

716
03:56:50,149 --> 03:57:07,270
right. Okay. We're back to normal. Things look okay. We're good. The dev tweet. Okay. Hold on.

717
03:57:07,270 --> 03:57:13,739
The dev tweeted a picture of, okay, that says, the dev's here. Sorry, I'm not playing the game.

718
03:57:13,739 --> 03:57:17,659
My brother in Christ, I made the game. I've seen it already. I'd rather watch whatever the fuck this

719
03:57:17,659 --> 03:57:34,709
is. Oh, sorry, I'm not playing the game. Yeah. All right. Let's check this out. Look at this.

720
03:57:36,489 --> 03:58:05,290
Look at this insanity. What is going on here? Is this a smoking image? It's cyber grind textures.

721
03:58:05,290 --> 03:58:14,520
I don't know what that means, but all right. I'm going to attempt to do something here. I'm

722
03:58:14,520 --> 03:58:25,559
going to attempt to play the game again because I'm going to play the game. That seems like a fun

723
03:58:25,559 --> 03:58:35,459
idea. I think that's what we're going to do. We're going to play. Okay. So what was I doing?

724
03:58:36,500 --> 03:58:40,819
That was fun. I forget how to play the game. I actually do. I really don't. I don't remember

725
03:58:40,819 --> 03:58:56,629
how to play. I don't remember how to play the game. I have to relearn the game. Okay. I'm

726
03:58:56,629 --> 03:59:02,149
fighting a boss right now. Let's fight this boss. I should probably take a break. All right. If I

727
03:59:02,149 --> 03:59:30,819
don't do it right now, then I'm going to take a break. Shit. It's hard. Oh my goodness.

728
03:59:50,200 --> 04:00:50,059
Fuck. How am I supposed to do this? Do I have to get close? Got it. I'm smart. This is going

729
04:00:50,059 --> 04:01:13,670
to be a part two. Nice checkpoint. Good. Hold on. I'm going to move this. You ever thought about

730
04:01:13,670 --> 04:01:21,260
making your own game? Maybe over the years. Yeah. It's just, it's a lot of time, a lot of work.

731
04:01:24,920 --> 04:01:32,629
Devs and getting PI. It's just, I had an idea at one point. Why do you look rendered? Because

732
04:01:32,629 --> 04:02:01,000
it might have a greasy oily skin. How am I going to ever afford that? I need a red skull to get in

733
04:02:01,000 --> 04:02:09,719
there. Sounds good. So we're going to just keep going. Right. Let's just go. Am I going the right

734
04:02:09,719 --> 04:03:14,579
way? I hope so. Oh, there it is. That was easy. Oh, it's time to excuse me. Wow. That hurt. I need

735
04:03:14,579 --> 04:03:25,000
to get, what's that do? I don't know. What do I do? What happened? I need to get help from the hand

736
04:03:25,000 --> 04:04:01,209
over there. Yikes. No shit. Oops. No, I don't understand how to get up that high.

737
04:04:41,959 --> 04:05:54,010
Yeah. I tried to hit the button. My fucking finger wouldn't do it. Fuck you. That didn't fucking work.

738
04:05:54,010 --> 04:06:18,840
I tried to dodge it. That shit just fucking killed me in one hit. What's going on? He's too big. I

739
04:06:18,840 --> 04:06:45,110
don't, but if I stay up here, he just like goes like this and I can't dodge it, bro. It's fucking,

740
04:06:45,110 --> 04:07:17,670
he takes up the whole map with his swing. Why did that? No parry. He's not, he's not glowing

741
04:07:17,670 --> 04:07:44,170
yellow. You can't parry it. I just tried. You can't parry. That was stupid. Just shut up. I

742
04:07:44,170 --> 04:08:33,989
didn't know you could parry it. I thought I had to be a projectile. I'm not grunting. What sex noises

743
04:08:33,989 --> 04:08:49,899
are you talking about? I've been silent the whole time. I don't understand the parry, man. I just,

744
04:08:49,899 --> 04:09:43,979
that looked fucking pretty clean to me. What the fuck? Where am I? I can't fucking move, man. No

745
04:09:43,979 --> 04:10:17,909
way. It's like, and you fucking float around like fucking low gravity. How was that not a parry? I

746
04:10:17,909 --> 04:11:14,780
don't get it. Oh my fucking God. You slug. What do I do? What do I do? Yeah. Fucking right. How?

747
04:11:15,340 --> 04:11:34,059
What is the frame? Is it one frame that I get to parry? Dude, excuse me. How are those wrong?

748
04:11:34,139 --> 04:11:47,479
Excuse me. Excuse me. I don't understand. I'm, I am, it's like, it won't do it. Am I doing it too

749
04:11:47,479 --> 04:12:01,159
late or too early? Fuck that. Fuck that. What do you mean too late? He's not even up, bro.

750
04:12:01,879 --> 04:12:04,840
No, it's that I don't understand the timing. Does it make any sense?

751
04:12:23,899 --> 04:12:54,899
Shut up. What the fuck, man? What are you talking about? This is not the easiest boss in the game.

752
04:12:54,899 --> 04:13:11,000
Get out of here. You played on fucking easy. You played on easy. Now, right? I don't, it doesn't

753
04:13:11,000 --> 04:13:19,620
make any sense. It doesn't, it doesn't make any logical sense as to why these aren't hitting.

754
04:13:19,620 --> 04:13:23,299
That's a parry. That's a parry in every parry game I've ever parried. That's a, that's a parry.

755
04:13:23,299 --> 04:13:26,899
I parried that in any parry game. That's a parry right there. I just did a parry. That's a parry

756
04:13:26,899 --> 04:13:31,940
literally in every single parry game you've ever played. That's a parry right there. That's a parry

757
04:13:31,940 --> 04:13:42,870
in every single game that has a parry, no matter what it is. This is literally impossible. I did,

758
04:13:43,190 --> 04:13:47,909
I did it. Time it. Go back and slow down. Go back and do slow motion. I did that. I did it

759
04:13:47,909 --> 04:14:24,120
perfectly every time. Go back and slow motion. Quiet. What? I hate falling off. And you know what

760
04:14:24,120 --> 04:14:28,920
it is? Dude, like falling off the legend, like floating down just makes me want to fucking bite

761
04:14:28,920 --> 04:15:00,840
my fucking hands off. This is so hard. It's just the timing with the stoop. It's just, I have such

762
04:15:00,840 --> 04:15:18,170
a small area and I float around like a fucking, I want to jump. Where's the double jump? I don't

763
04:15:18,170 --> 04:15:22,889
want a triple dash. I want a double jump. Where's the upgrades if I can put that shit in the game?

764
04:15:23,690 --> 04:16:25,579
I want a, what? I got a heal right now. What? Stop falling off the stupid tiny platform.

765
04:16:25,579 --> 04:16:31,579
The game, there's so much fast movement that like, oh wait, be careful. Don't slide up that son. It's

766
04:16:31,579 --> 04:17:08,889
fucking two inches. Quiet. I'm fucking losing it. Relax. Now get up there and stop it.

767
04:17:09,290 --> 04:17:36,010
Get back up there. You stupid piece of shit. You have to be kidding me. You can't, I was in,

768
04:17:36,010 --> 04:17:54,309
it was the end of the fucking game. I don't get it. I don't get it because it feels like I'm landing

769
04:17:54,309 --> 04:19:02,180
those well. The speed run for that fight is two seconds. I'm trying so badly not to make like,

770
04:19:02,180 --> 04:19:07,059
yeah, sounds, but I fucking can't help it. I got a D. I don't care. Oh shit. This is it. I got two

771
04:19:07,059 --> 04:19:30,620
more levels. It's all right. Relax. Whoa. Get out of here. What is this bullshit? You need to watch

772
04:19:30,620 --> 04:20:45,510
the clip. What clip? What clip? I'm just not good enough to fucking do it. Oh, what? Oh,

773
04:20:45,510 --> 04:21:57,690
monkey ass. Shut up. Oh shit. That's not it. That it? Woof. Best of luck. Vod watchers. What happened?

774
04:21:57,690 --> 04:22:18,069
You just went goblin mode. I am making weird noises. Aren't I? What? I'm going like,

775
04:22:21,559 --> 04:22:33,909
that's what I sound like when I'm concentrating. What? Is it because I have the audio in my ears?

776
04:22:42,920 --> 04:22:45,959
That was really loud and horrible, but like, what do you want me to do?

777
04:22:45,959 --> 04:23:02,120
That was like loud and horrible. This looks like, this looks like an actor watched, you know,

778
04:23:02,120 --> 04:23:09,260
like maybe one to 200 hours of Twitch streams to research a role where he plays a Twitch streamer

779
04:23:11,209 --> 04:23:26,920
in a movie. And that's what I'm doing. Yeah, that's interesting. My voice is like gone now too.

780
04:23:26,920 --> 04:23:39,479
Breathing is definitely noticeable. That's because I don't have a noise gate anymore.

781
04:23:39,479 --> 04:23:50,569
Oh, look at this. I really do go like, fuck, I got to fix that by next stream. Why can I break this?

782
04:23:50,569 --> 04:24:58,870
Can I not break that? I don't get it. What's going on? Holy shit. Did I win? I've been silent. What

783
04:24:58,870 --> 04:25:33,139
are you talking about? I've been silent the whole time. What? What the fuck? Huh? Is this what you're

784
04:25:33,139 --> 04:26:05,209
talking about? That's fucked up. Why am I, why do I do that? Why do I do that? I'm serious. Why

785
04:26:05,209 --> 04:26:14,170
am I doing that? I'm going, what? I'm going, look at the dev tweet. Honest to fucking God,

786
04:26:14,170 --> 04:26:22,889
I didn't even know I was doing that. I swear to God, this is what's usually blocked. What did

787
04:26:22,889 --> 04:26:39,610
the dev say? I don't, I guess I just make weird sounds. Grunt Gary. I guess I just make weird

788
04:26:39,610 --> 04:26:48,950
sounds with my mouth. I guess I thought you guys would seriously just messing around. 40 year old

789
04:26:48,950 --> 04:26:59,479
man. I did not, I, I didn't, whatever. I'm just going to keep playing the game. It's because,

790
04:26:59,479 --> 04:27:05,159
you know what? I have both headphones in. So, and it's loud and I'm really gaming and I'm just,

791
04:27:05,159 --> 04:27:11,219
every so often I'm kind of like, Oh my fucking God guys. I swear that's actually embarrassing.

792
04:27:12,020 --> 04:27:59,209
Whatever. Who cares? Supreme. Oops. That don't die, right? Did I do it? Did I, did I just do it?

793
04:27:59,930 --> 04:28:15,379
Did I just do it? No. Are you sure? I kind of sounded, I felt like I did. I have to climb all

794
04:28:15,379 --> 04:29:31,059
the way up. Goodbye. Holy shit. There's so many. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

795
04:29:31,059 --> 04:29:35,860
no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Fuck. This is hard. Stay with the shotgun. There's nothing. This is

796
04:29:35,860 --> 04:30:26,090
the best weapon in the game. Nothing is better than this. No, no, no, no. Don't you dare. Don't

797
04:30:26,090 --> 04:31:03,860
you dare. Let's go. Checkpoint up there. Oh my God. Get to the checkpoint. Just touch the checkpoint.

798
04:31:03,860 --> 04:31:46,459
Touch it. Yeah. Get up. Get up. Stop going in the water. I fucking hate the water. Get the

799
04:31:46,459 --> 04:31:57,430
water out of here. Delete it. It's going to kill me. This fucking poison water is going to kill me.

800
04:31:57,430 --> 04:32:03,690
I hate water in video games. I hate going into water. All right. Water sucks. It's so annoying

801
04:32:03,690 --> 04:33:11,060
to play in a video game. I hate water. Yeah. I need a checkpoint, right? Ooh, that's it.

802
04:33:11,060 --> 04:33:14,180
I did it. All right. This is three, two. I think this is the end of the game.

803
04:33:14,180 --> 04:33:19,419
Three, two. When are you going to play Freddy Fish? Curse of the Fish or whatever. Whatever.

804
04:33:19,419 --> 04:33:36,599
Stupid fucking kids game is. I don't know. Next week. Fire is a powerful drill that sticks to an

805
04:33:36,599 --> 04:33:42,279
enemy and deals damage over time. The drill causes enemies to bleed with continuously with extra

806
04:33:42,279 --> 04:33:51,930
healing range. Okay. What's the other one? Fires an instant beam that causes a large explosion on

807
04:33:51,930 --> 04:33:56,090
impact similar to a certain familiar face. Wipes out groups of weak enemies with ease.

808
04:33:56,729 --> 04:35:38,889
I think I want this. So that sticks on them. I'll try it. Okay. Now what? So I'm a robot

809
04:35:38,889 --> 04:36:46,580
and I'm defying my maker. What the hell is that? What the fuck? I missed. No, I didn't. That's

810
04:36:46,580 --> 04:37:55,319
holy shit in my fucking pants. Oh my God. Dude. I think I got him. Dude. It's so

811
04:37:55,319 --> 04:38:33,529
fucking ridiculous. Yo. Should I block him? Can I block those? It's happening too fast.

812
04:38:34,409 --> 04:38:46,939
I'm 37 years old, guys. I don't think I can do it. I'm 37. This is like a 19 year old's brain

813
04:38:46,939 --> 04:39:09,779
can handle this. I'm too old. I think I'm too old to do this. Oh, how did I miss from relax?

814
04:39:10,500 --> 04:39:19,139
I don't even have time to think. It happens so quickly. I just like by the time he dashes,

815
04:39:19,139 --> 04:39:38,919
it's like, I don't even know. What am I? Where do I go? What should I do? What the fuck, man?

816
04:39:39,639 --> 04:40:11,779
Well, what? This game's on times five speed. I can't even turn around fast enough to fight this guy

817
04:40:11,779 --> 04:40:56,090
where I, I, no way, man. I don't think so. I don't fucking think so. I don't think I

818
04:40:57,610 --> 04:41:01,049
suffering. Fuck it. I don't think I'm going to be able to do this.

819
04:41:20,740 --> 04:41:38,119
Guys, you know what? Okay. In the time for me to move my, my ring finger to hit shift,

820
04:41:38,119 --> 04:41:44,119
he's already hit me or control. It's like my brain can't go faster than he can. He's like,

821
04:41:44,119 --> 04:42:27,659
just he's like programmed to go fucking faster than me. I, dude, I don't even, where are you going?

822
04:42:27,659 --> 04:42:58,419
Come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come. Fuck you. I missed.

823
04:42:58,500 --> 04:43:29,900
I should be fucking picking a wheelbarrow and filling it full of wheat and bringing it to the

824
04:43:29,900 --> 04:43:36,700
fucking town center. Okay. You imagine a fucking person from like the 10 hundreds being like,

825
04:43:36,700 --> 04:43:42,060
seeing this shit. No, I should be like, I should be baking the fucking muffins.

826
04:43:42,060 --> 04:44:37,430
I shouldn't be doing what I'm doing. No. Fuck you. Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it,

827
04:44:37,430 --> 04:44:57,500
fuck you. Come on. Oh, come on, Morty. You're going to get out of here. You're going to get out

828
04:44:57,500 --> 04:45:26,840
of here. You're going to get out of here. I missed. I missed again. I missed again. I missed again.

829
04:45:26,840 --> 04:46:11,369
Just keep the shotgun out. Fuck. It's not fair. What the fuck are you supposed to do about this

830
04:46:11,369 --> 04:46:40,340
fucking guy? No, I don't want, all right. Can I just delete all the weapons besides the shotgun

831
04:46:40,340 --> 04:47:00,180
in the, I don't want to like, Oh, I don't want to use anything but these two weapons. I'm fucking

832
04:47:00,180 --> 04:47:11,130
dead. I'm dead. I'm dead. Oh my God. I, I, I only want two weapons. How do I delete them right now?

833
04:47:11,130 --> 04:47:24,340
Get rid of them. I don't want them. Delete them. I don't want this stupid. Why is it even in the

834
04:47:24,340 --> 04:47:42,250
game? Oh, wow. It's what a great. Yeah. Unequip. I don't want that one.

835
04:48:02,299 --> 04:48:25,290
Let's go. Let's go. Come here. Come here. Come here. You can't be.

836
04:48:52,840 --> 04:49:11,750
Where is he? Oh, get this shotgun away too. There's no point in me having this equipped.

837
04:49:13,459 --> 04:49:17,380
What's the point of me using the shotgun? It doesn't do anything.

838
04:49:24,439 --> 04:49:28,520
Just delete the fucking shotgun. It does no fucking, this has no purpose.

839
04:49:28,520 --> 04:50:25,080
Go. That's this guy's fucking head. Where'd he go? My boogers.

840
04:50:38,569 --> 04:51:19,450
Where's my sound effects? What the fuck? What are you talking about? He can't do it.

841
04:51:37,900 --> 04:51:40,540
Yeah. I'm sorry. I screamed so loud, but I missed.

842
04:51:47,000 --> 04:51:56,580
I'm sorry. I'm so fucking loud. I'm so sorry. Oh my God. Can I ask a question? How the fuck

843
04:51:56,580 --> 04:52:02,169
are you supposed to do this? Reliably? Are you supposed to just spam at this guy? I,

844
04:52:02,169 --> 04:52:09,560
what are you supposed to do about this motherfucker? I'm going to save it. Hold on.

845
04:52:15,979 --> 04:52:26,380
No fucking way. You're doing everything wrong. No parry. I like, I like you to parry this for me.

846
04:52:27,029 --> 04:52:31,590
Oh, I'm sorry. That was loud too, but fucking, you know, fucking my,

847
04:52:31,590 --> 04:52:59,959
I'm from fucking Boston. Did you guys know? Eat shit. Where's my,

848
04:53:30,540 --> 04:54:15,419
get down here. I need another weapon. I need another weapon. Okay. I need another weapon.

849
04:54:15,419 --> 04:54:29,659
No, dude. Come on. This is a fucking impossible. Oh my God, dude. All right. I'll only try to

850
04:54:29,659 --> 04:54:36,220
parry this impossible dog shit here. Okay. Here we go. Ready? I, dude, he's like just

851
04:54:36,220 --> 04:55:02,020
teleports behind you. Oh my fucking God. This is impossible. How would you do this on the harder

852
04:55:02,020 --> 04:55:12,630
difficulties? It's not even human. It's inhuman. How hard this is. Come on. Come on. Come on. This

853
04:55:12,630 --> 04:55:59,909
is it. God. I don't. Yes. Oh, sorry. That was loud. Unequip all of your weapons. That is

854
04:55:59,909 --> 04:56:08,139
definitely the way. Yes. Unequip all of your weapons. That is definitely the way.

855
04:56:08,139 --> 04:56:18,729
As the voice actor for this fight, making fun of me in the face of all the haters. Let's go.

856
04:56:34,340 --> 04:56:59,299
Give me the little beatbox. Shoot it Adam. I don't know what to do. What do I do? I've

857
04:56:59,299 --> 04:57:27,029
never been this far. I don't know, dude. I've never been this far. My hands are falling apart.

858
04:57:27,029 --> 04:57:46,330
I can't even touch my mouse. They're wet. They're wet. They're wet. Holy shit. What's going on?

859
04:57:46,330 --> 04:57:54,630
Let's kill me. Fucking kill me motherfucker. I don't care. Okay. We're good. We're good.

860
04:57:54,630 --> 04:58:00,409
Everybody relax. Relax. Relax. Relax. Relax. Everything's fine. That's it. Okay. Ready?

861
04:58:07,659 --> 04:58:13,060
Just relax. Everything's fine. I think you have a liver problem. Okay. Because my hands are

862
04:58:13,060 --> 04:58:17,540
sweating because I'm playing a game that's literally impossible. I'm playing a game that's

863
04:58:17,540 --> 04:58:21,619
literally not completable. It's impossible. And of course I'm going to have a little bit

864
04:58:21,619 --> 04:58:29,500
of a sweaty scenario. Okay. Everything's fine. You're getting me riled up. He's so bad.

865
04:58:59,979 --> 04:59:19,509
I missed. Oh my God. What's a steam? Fuck you. Fuck you. What is it on steam? What's the

866
04:59:19,509 --> 04:59:24,150
achievement on this one? What's the achievement on this one? You there. I'm talking to you. You.

867
04:59:24,150 --> 04:59:30,549
What's the achievement on this one? Percentage on steam. What is it? Okay. If it's, if this is

868
04:59:30,549 --> 04:59:36,779
more than 20%, no, if it's live, this is wait, if this is more than 20%, I will eat two shoes on

869
04:59:36,779 --> 05:00:07,080
camera. This fight on normal or harder. There's no achievement for this one. There's no achievements.

870
05:00:11,459 --> 05:00:20,439
Okay. Nevermind. No shoes. There's no achievements in the whole game. Oh, oops. All right. Let's go.

871
05:00:20,599 --> 05:00:32,970
Okay. Stop eating shoes. Everybody relax. Just calm down. You need to, you need to calm down.

872
05:00:33,930 --> 05:01:22,040
You're concerning me. You need to calm down. You can't be fucking serious, mate. Guys. I don't

873
05:01:22,040 --> 05:02:07,509
think this is possible. What the fuck just happened? I parried him accidentally. Huh? Huh?

874
05:02:19,860 --> 05:02:24,200
This is what animal does. Animal from the puppets. Whenever he runs around, he goes like,

875
05:02:24,599 --> 05:03:22,419
huh, huh, huh. Wait a minute. I missed. I missed. Just kill me.

876
05:03:45,900 --> 05:03:56,299
Jesus Christ. It's, I, I don't, dude, I don't, it's just everything is happening so

877
05:03:56,299 --> 05:04:01,799
quickly. And so there's only explosive shit he has. And then he gets angry and everything becomes

878
05:04:01,799 --> 05:04:13,209
one hit kill. Oh, what are, who, why? What? I got it. I got it. I got this time. I'm going to win.

879
05:04:13,209 --> 05:04:26,220
I'm going to win. I'm going to win. Bro, bro, bro, bro, bro, slow down. I just need to hit you with

880
05:04:26,220 --> 05:04:45,290
this. I got it. Oh my God. It's so ridiculous. I can't fucking believe it. It's just like,

881
05:04:49,209 --> 05:04:49,689
it's just,

882
05:05:14,540 --> 05:06:00,200
the fuck am I going to do with that shit? What the hell was that for? Oh, fuck off. I don't even,

883
05:06:01,000 --> 05:06:09,529
I don't even know where the fuck the guy goes. It's just, it's just loud sound effects and

884
05:06:10,650 --> 05:06:35,319
I can't, I can't block them. Increase your FOV. What the fuck is this person talking about?

885
05:06:35,319 --> 05:07:17,110
That's not going to help. This feels off. I missed. Just kill me. Shut up. That's the problem.

886
05:07:39,580 --> 05:07:44,220
It's just like click, click, click, click, click. It's fucking so ridiculous. It's,

887
05:07:44,459 --> 05:08:07,900
it's ridiculous, man. This is the end. This is the end right here. No, it's not. Oh my God.

888
05:08:07,900 --> 05:08:53,750
Damn it. I don't even, I'm just going to dodge and shoot them. I was actually, it's pretty easy.

889
05:08:53,750 --> 05:08:57,430
It's still fucking, it's still fucking impossible. It really is still fucking impossible.

890
05:09:41,450 --> 05:10:15,020
There's a fucking thousand volts in my chair. No, I have to get them down to half with just

891
05:10:15,020 --> 05:10:21,220
the regular revolver. I have to. It's not fucking possible any other way. And like the amount of

892
05:10:21,220 --> 05:10:25,939
buttons guys, I probably press the buttons 5,000, 10,000 times. Humans were not supposed to be

893
05:10:25,939 --> 05:10:34,299
doing this. You understand? We were supposed to be drinking water and not like, like no fucking way.

894
05:10:34,299 --> 05:10:37,819
We were supposed to be doing this shit. We're supposed to be, Amish had it right.

895
05:11:12,220 --> 05:11:21,020
What did it switch? I hit Q accidentally. I touched Q and it switched fucking weapons.

896
05:11:21,419 --> 05:11:34,020
Oh, unbind Q and just unbind it. It's going to accidentally be pressed. Fucking God.

897
05:11:36,259 --> 05:11:43,560
Just take it off. I don't want any of this shit. Delete it. Delete this. Delete it. How do I remove

898
05:11:43,560 --> 05:11:49,349
it? I'm going to make it like fucking equal sign of something I'm never going to touch.

899
05:11:50,229 --> 05:12:00,790
So we're going to do some breathing exercises now. That feels good. It feels pretty good.

900
05:12:00,790 --> 05:12:11,159
It feels pretty good. I wish I was using one of these. Not like this.

901
05:12:58,520 --> 05:14:01,880
I just had to hold my breath for fucking few minutes. 89 restarts. Yo, this is a meltdown

902
05:14:01,880 --> 05:14:10,310
stream. No, it's not. It was a, it was an intense gaming stream. Disgrace, humiliation, unseeming,

903
05:14:11,500 --> 05:14:17,610
unseemingly, unseemly and unwelcome at the feet of the council. Their eyes ablaze with bitter

904
05:14:17,610 --> 05:14:23,700
resentment glaring through Gabriel's wounds of body and soul bore outward for all to see.

905
05:14:23,700 --> 05:14:29,700
Has this one abandoned the way of our creator? It is unworthy of its holy light. The father's

906
05:14:29,700 --> 05:14:38,409
light is indomitable. This one sees fit to squander it. Their words resonated in Gabriel's limbs

907
05:14:38,409 --> 05:14:45,049
coursing through as lightning upon wire searing his that would strike lesser's death and blind.

908
05:14:45,049 --> 05:14:50,700
The holy light within him an unstoppable storm of divine fury insurmountable for mere. I'm not,

909
05:14:50,700 --> 05:14:55,430
I'm, I'm, I'm a normal person. Okay. Let's just get that out of the way. This he knew.

910
05:14:55,430 --> 05:14:59,029
Holy council. My devotion to our creator is absolute. I have never strayed from the

911
05:14:59,029 --> 05:15:06,060
will of the father, but a machine. You dare imply the might of the somebody will read this

912
05:15:06,060 --> 05:15:16,060
impossible hearsay unspeakable heresy silence. Your treachery will not be tolerated as punishment.

913
05:15:16,060 --> 05:15:21,819
The father's light shall be severed from your body. You have 24 hours. I'm like objecting in

914
05:15:21,819 --> 05:15:28,229
a courtroom. You have 24 hours before the last of the embers die out and you with them prove your

915
05:15:28,229 --> 05:15:33,849
loyalty. Unmake your mistakes. As the light was ripped from his being. Gabriel's screams were

916
05:15:33,849 --> 05:15:39,930
silenced in the hyst of gospel and praise of God, a boiling Anguish to which even the fires of hell

917
05:15:39,930 --> 05:15:49,419
could not compare pretty fucked up. If the machine seek blood, he would give it freely.

918
05:15:49,419 --> 05:15:55,349
And with such fury, even metal will bleed. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

919
05:15:56,709 --> 05:16:12,139
Whatever act two. Imperfect hatred coming soon. Do I have act two? Do I own it? Do I have,
