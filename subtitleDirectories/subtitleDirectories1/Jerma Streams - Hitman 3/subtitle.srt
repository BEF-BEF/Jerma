1
00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:03,129
No, no, I'm not late and I'm not canceling.

2
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:11,320
I'm not late and I'm not canceling. Look what you made me do.

3
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:15,560
Look what you made me do. I just tried to take a sip of my coffee.

4
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:20,010
I stabbed my mouth right into the front of my lip. Look what you made me do.

5
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:26,739
Hi guys. How are you? Hope you're doing well.

6
00:00:29,179 --> 00:00:36,460
I had a little bit of a surprise. I was kind of, I forgot that Hitman 3 came out yesterday.

7
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:40,899
I forgot. And here it is.

8
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:46,729
I have a few things to talk about with you for a little while before we go anywhere.

9
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:53,259
There is a very certain stream that some of you have been maybe waiting for the last week.

10
00:00:54,219 --> 00:00:57,020
Not the Catboy one. Don't worry. That's being worked on too.

11
00:00:57,020 --> 00:01:00,539
All of you Catboy enthusiasts. Just hold on.

12
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:10,019
So the Bionicle movie, interestingly enough, I cannot stream that to Twitch.

13
00:01:11,099 --> 00:01:19,180
I need the rights to it. That's something that I cannot do.

14
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:26,540
But hold on a second. Hold on a minute. Reach out and see if they'll let me do it.

15
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:30,140
So right now we're reaching out to see if that's something I can do.

16
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:35,530
We're in the process of reaching out. Probably going to get instantly denied.

17
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:39,129
But you know, we're probably going to get denied.

18
00:01:39,129 --> 00:01:41,370
Look, there's like all kinds of music and shit in there.

19
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:46,730
I don't have the distribution rights to show that even though it's free on YouTube.

20
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:51,530
There's a lot of legal gray area there.

21
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:56,489
So that's currently being worked on. Something else is being worked on too.

22
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:06,760
There are four major, major things happening stream-wise over the next probably three months.

23
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:12,780
I'm just going to give you a quick little hint. I'm not going to tell you what it is.

24
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:16,060
If you haven't even heard me talk about this. What's going on here?

25
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:20,550
There's like a floating thing of dust right here. Get out of here.

26
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:24,330
I'm going to say two words. That's all I'm going to say.

27
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:27,689
You will see this within the next couple of months.

28
00:02:29,509 --> 00:02:36,259
The archaeologist stream. Maybe work your brain around what that means.

29
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:51,030
The first word was not even a word. It was a beginning. A preposition? What is it?

30
00:02:52,180 --> 00:03:00,550
What's a the? It's not a noun. It's not a verb. What is it? It's an article.

31
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:07,419
Oh, okay. Whatever. Yeah, the title's bad. Whatever.

32
00:03:08,139 --> 00:03:15,319
What is a preposition? It's an article adjective.

33
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:17,719
Yeah, what's a preposition though? What does that do? What does that mean?

34
00:03:22,729 --> 00:03:27,050
You see, you should what? You should see if you can get on the coliseum.

35
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:34,939
I don't even know what that is. The location or time. Okay, cool.

36
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:41,259
Yeah, there's also there's a lot. This is the baseball stream is happening.

37
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:48,620
Every like 20 to 30 days here, as of like the 1st of February,

38
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:56,460
this is going to be something else. 2020 got destroyed for big streams.

39
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:59,990
Two of them were pretty much already paid for and ready to go.

40
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:04,229
One of them in particular had to be cancelled. So we had to move a bunch of stuff from 2020

41
00:04:04,229 --> 00:04:14,060
into 2021. So 2021 is going to be stacked. It's going to be loaded with potentially fun stuff to

42
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:26,490
do. Is this going to be the best year ever on the channel? I've refused to say that because

43
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:30,329
if I say that, then it might be the worst year on the channel. I'm not going to do that.

44
00:04:32,259 --> 00:04:37,180
No, this might be some fun things to do. I can't say that if you say that all of a sudden,

45
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:46,420
it's become something. It's now if it's not, then Oh, every year is better than the last year

46
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:59,990
until it's not muck. It's year of the cat boy. Are you peddling fried chicken to people? I saw

47
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:06,709
that. What am I supposed to do about it? You want to see how far that meme has left this community?

48
00:05:06,709 --> 00:05:11,829
Like we talked about two or three weeks ago, look no further than the Kentucky fried chicken

49
00:05:12,389 --> 00:05:23,800
account on Twitter. KFC underscore es. It's the it's the it's the it's Espanol, right? It's the

50
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:30,730
Spain version. Yeah. The Spanish Kentucky fried chicken. They made me Colonel Sanders with the

51
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:35,529
sus face thing. That's just how you know it's out of our control anymore. And I can't I can't

52
00:05:35,529 --> 00:05:47,209
control it anymore. What's that thing? I'm gonna tell my kids that this was Colonel Sanders.

53
00:05:49,240 --> 00:06:02,199
I mean, that's that's funny. I think it could be. So what do you mean? What am I supposed to do?

54
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:07,800
Do you think the Kentucky fried chicken Twitter account made any money on that post?

55
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:17,029
But should I like claim that post? What does that get me?

56
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:29,180
Do you see a them? No, I don't I don't care. If I'm not going to go after the people that used me

57
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:34,379
in a porn ad, am I going to go? Am I going to try to go after Kentucky fried chicken Spain?

58
00:06:34,939 --> 00:06:47,879
Are you guys out of your minds? I mean, what? What? What? What? I don't know. Is it? You guys

59
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:51,560
weren't around for that? That wasn't that long ago. That was only like a few months ago. It was like

60
00:06:51,560 --> 00:07:01,959
six months ago. No, I don't think it's funny. Whatever. If people want to have fun with that

61
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:09,639
image, that what do you want me to say? It's okay. Does. Let me ask you this. Does bad luck Brian

62
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:24,629
like sue somebody for using the bad luck Brian image? What do you want me to say? He should.

63
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:34,819
You are no bad luck, Brian. Um, I didn't say I was. I just just saying that like

64
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:38,819
once it's kind of on the internet, it goes out there. What am I going to do about it?

65
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:47,670
You are no bad luck, Brian. Oh, let me just dump an entire bottle of detergent on the ground real

66
00:07:47,670 --> 00:08:00,379
quick. Almost done. There it is. Gotta clean my room. Gotta clean my room. Gotta clean my room.

67
00:08:01,259 --> 00:08:05,860
Little horse today for some reason strized end effect for exposure.

68
00:08:06,579 --> 00:08:13,829
What was that? That was a fucking fresh. Let's hey, let's let's let's get let's open it. Let's

69
00:08:13,829 --> 00:08:22,740
see what it sounds like. Yeah, that's as a fresh fuel. Let's get a good sip of this berry fuel.

70
00:08:32,259 --> 00:08:36,899
No soy in that. Shut that mouth of yours. We're gonna play the hitman three today.

71
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:46,090
There's no soy in it. There's no soy in this bottle. I like this shit and I'm not sponsored

72
00:08:46,090 --> 00:09:02,059
by them. I was kind of cool, you know? No, I'm kidding. I actually this helped me gain weight,

73
00:09:02,059 --> 00:09:06,299
helped me put on some weight back when I was having some trouble. So no, they get a they get

74
00:09:06,299 --> 00:09:14,169
a stamp of approval from me. They're peanuts. They're peanuts and heal. They're peanuts and

75
00:09:14,169 --> 00:09:17,529
heal. They're peanuts and heal. They're peanuts and heal. They're peanuts and heal. Okay. Oh,

76
00:09:17,529 --> 00:09:22,490
okay. Did I say gross to that? What are you able to say? That's fine. What's wrong with that?

77
00:09:23,289 --> 00:09:31,590
Where are the peanuts? Contains tree nuts, coconut. So you were wrong. This coconut,

78
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:39,610
there's tree nuts in this. It's like probably made in the same plant that produces nuts or something.

79
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:52,700
Free nuts equal peanuts. Free nuts are unshelled soy. What the fuck are you talking about?

80
00:09:52,700 --> 00:10:02,259
Oh, that's you're ridiculous. All right, hold on. Uh, where am I going here? I need to put this up.

81
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:09,990
Yeah, apparently, from what I've heard, guys, I heard Hitman three is like unbelievable.

82
00:10:10,629 --> 00:10:21,299
Thanks to the 10 subs. Watch Meister. I've heard this is the best one yet. Very excited. Those of

83
00:10:21,299 --> 00:10:28,740
you that know this channel, we are, we are Hitmen enthusiasts. Hitman two was one of my favorite

84
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:34,980
games that came out a couple of years ago. The new kind of re-handled. I'm sorry. I've read

85
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:43,429
somebody that said 1080 can't handle it and you just threw me off completely. Um, what was I doing?

86
00:10:43,429 --> 00:10:53,370
Anyways, uh, well, I did, I think it'd be fine. If it's not, then whatever. I heard it's very good.

87
00:10:53,370 --> 00:11:00,649
So I'm looking forward to it. We're just going to play it. I have no set. Uh, I want to do the VR,

88
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:10,149
but it's PSVR only. I was serious. I, I, all right. I had a PSVR and I gave it away. I just,

89
00:11:10,149 --> 00:11:14,379
I gave it to somebody because I was like, I'm never going to fucking use this ever again,

90
00:11:14,379 --> 00:11:19,639
ever. It was not a single reason in my mind where that would ever turn on ever again.

91
00:11:19,639 --> 00:11:30,230
Because I had the Vive. If you buy a Vive and you have a PSVR, what's the point of having the PSVR

92
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:46,039
at that point? The VR is really bad though. Okay. I didn't break it. Stop. I'm procrastinating.

93
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:51,750
Stop procrastinating. Wait, did you just, I've read that wrong. I think the title is bad. I don't

94
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:57,899
care. It's just hit, man. That's all it is. That's what you came here for. My headphones,

95
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:07,980
stop stalling. I haven't seen you guys in like four or five, six days or something. I can't just

96
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:15,860
hang on and say, what's up. I can't like, I can't turn on the fucking webcam. I can't turn the

97
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:26,570
webcam on and I can't, what? I'm not allowed to turn on the webcam and I can't turn the webcam on.

98
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:32,710
Was I naked for a frame? I hope not. I can't turn the webcam on and show you this scrumptious cake.

99
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:49,929
What do you think about that? That's a 2021 Rice Krispie Treat planetary cake. This was supposed

100
00:12:49,929 --> 00:12:54,600
to be shown on, hold on. How's the hair look? This was supposed to be shown on New Year's,

101
00:12:54,600 --> 00:13:04,730
but I didn't have it. 2021. Let's go. You're a comical British villain. You guys want to

102
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:32,230
see something funny? That bed was like $200. That bed was like 30. Who made the cake? My mother did.

103
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:49,240
My mother made the cake. I'm not going to bite it. I want to preserve it. $200 dog fed. Yeah,

104
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:53,320
my, my, by the way, my mother's the one that made the shoe as well. Remember we talked about that?

105
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:59,340
Bite the cake like it's an apple. I'm not going to bite. No, I want to preserve it.

106
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:05,779
I want to put it in the freezer and like keep it frozen. This dude's a millionaire.

107
00:14:05,779 --> 00:14:12,120
No, I wanted my dog to be incredibly comfortable. I wanted my dog to be incredibly comfortable.

108
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:18,360
Is there something wrong with that? And I'm going to spend money on my special boy.

109
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:27,370
He's worth spending the money on even though he doesn't even like the bed. In fact, he like

110
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:34,730
refuses to sleep in it now because the $30 circle bed is this is so much better. Apparently your mom

111
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:48,059
puts up with a lot of your shenanigans. I love my mother. Come on. She participates. Sleep on it.

112
00:14:48,059 --> 00:14:58,309
You sleep on that one. You just keep him around for YouTube revenue. Let's get this fucking bath

113
00:14:58,309 --> 00:15:06,139
robot because it's hot and I can just be naked like I was the way I should be. Make sure I don't

114
00:15:06,139 --> 00:15:12,500
accidentally turn the camera on because no, that would be very bad. Okay. This game is so good. I

115
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:24,309
know. I'm so looking forward to it. IO interactive just gets so much credit from me so much. I want

116
00:15:24,309 --> 00:15:30,899
you to think of a company that is made that has like a franchise like this. They, they bought out

117
00:15:30,899 --> 00:15:35,220
their assets. They bought them out. They pulled away from Square Enix. They, they were like,

118
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:40,629
you know, fuck it. We're buying you out. We're buying out our shit from you. They went over.

119
00:15:40,629 --> 00:15:45,350
They made Hitman, Hitman 2, this one Hitman 3. They know what they can do. They know what they're good

120
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:58,340
at and they just do it. And all of these have been very, very, very good. Nobody talks about this.

121
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:02,419
Nobody talks about how Square, I almost said Square Enix. That was wrong. Nobody, does anybody

122
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:06,840
talk about how good of like how great IO interactive is with their releases? It's been like every,

123
00:16:06,919 --> 00:16:10,009
they just, they know what they're doing. How do we talk? But people are always like,

124
00:16:10,009 --> 00:16:20,500
I love Bethesda. No, no, no. Love IO interactive. That's better. You said, you already said that.

125
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:30,870
So what? This might be like one of my favorite game companies. Okay. Are you guys ready? I'm excited.

126
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:47,129
God damn it. I should, whatever. God. Great. Is my, turn the cam on. No. Wait, I gotta make a pasta.

127
00:16:47,129 --> 00:16:57,029
You, I, it's 4 PM Pacific. You had time? Stop stalling. Stop stalling. This is like my favorite

128
00:16:57,029 --> 00:17:02,620
game of the year. This is going to be my favorite release of the year. I play like four new games

129
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:08,250
a year. This is definitely going to be, just watch, clip this. I'm going to be sitting there

130
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:12,859
at the game awards this time next year. Hitman 3 is going to be on that list. And I'm going to be

131
00:17:12,859 --> 00:17:16,920
like, Oh, I'm going to be pursing my lips, leaning back, leaning back in the bathrobe, pointing.

132
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:23,289
There it is. That's the one. And it's going to lose. It's not going to win. And I'm going to be

133
00:17:23,289 --> 00:17:28,779
like, you know, I really wish I hitman 3 would have won. I'm going to be like, that's my boy.

134
00:17:28,779 --> 00:17:37,019
Right. Look at this shit. You can just, I can play them all. I can play every single one of these.

135
00:17:37,019 --> 00:17:47,430
Is agent 47 the super Mario of PC gaming now that we haven't seen Gordon Freeman in a long time?

136
00:17:47,430 --> 00:18:03,579
Okay. Should we get like a previously on the next game of Thrones? Let's do it. All right.

137
00:18:03,579 --> 00:18:11,480
We're going to do previously on the next game of Thrones. Agent 47 are the world's top assassins

138
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:17,700
working for the ICA. Unknowingly, they have been hired by a shadow client to target a number of

139
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:24,099
operatives of Providence, a secret organization working so excited. I love this game. I'm already

140
00:18:24,099 --> 00:18:28,420
going to love it. I can't wait to throw a plate. The first person I see approaches Diana and makes

141
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:38,359
her eliminate the shadow client. 47 asked my past, but when my past was that the shadow client is

142
00:18:38,359 --> 00:18:46,869
Lucas gray lost childhood friend. He and Diana switch sides to fulfill an old pact, destroy

143
00:18:47,829 --> 00:18:50,630
louder. We need more fuel. Hold on.

144
00:18:54,069 --> 00:19:01,259
The three Providence partners eliminate them and the war would be over. I took my headphones out. I

145
00:19:01,259 --> 00:19:07,420
have to like, however, the constant has an ace up his sleeve. I don't even need to pay attention to

146
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:16,900
the story. I know how to play hitman. Throws plates, shoes, strangle people in the bathroom

147
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:23,430
and you have a barcode on your head. That's all I know. That's all I really need to know.

148
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:27,190
Holy shit. Do you actually go in a plane in this one on top of the world?

149
00:19:31,269 --> 00:19:35,509
47. This is Diana here. Come on, do it, do it, do it, do it so I can fucking just move on.

150
00:19:35,509 --> 00:19:44,549
Look close. No, that's not you in the shadows behind the everyday world,

151
00:19:44,549 --> 00:19:47,269
beyond the headlines and the seats of power.

152
00:19:48,619 --> 00:19:56,359
Why? All right.

153
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:06,339
You get to drive a car. Did they finally let you do that in hitman?

154
00:20:06,339 --> 00:20:11,299
We were just please. Do you drive a car and hitman three and throw away,

155
00:20:11,299 --> 00:20:20,039
do the unthinkable, the unforgivable. And it never gave us a second thought.

156
00:20:20,039 --> 00:20:26,069
Okay. If it's a full letter grade, if I can drive a car, what if it's an A after decades in the

157
00:20:26,069 --> 00:20:38,019
shadows? We are fighting because the S me and 47 much has been lost, but we are closer than ever.

158
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:46,069
We trapped the constant Providence is chief control and finally learned the names.

159
00:20:46,069 --> 00:20:56,420
Don't see very much water in their downfall, asked to rest and just maybe.

160
00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:03,670
Look, they must've had plenty of heel on them. I'm not. Okay. I'm done doing this.

161
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:23,960
I'm not sponsored by this company. Hitman hitman pause button, not an Xbox control.

162
00:21:24,839 --> 00:21:40,470
This is the Xbox version. You know, I never planned this far ahead.

163
00:21:41,349 --> 00:21:49,029
You never do. I just got his memory back. Wait, is that a beacon?

164
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:54,230
Is it? Whoa, pull it, pull it, pull it, pull the wire.

165
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:08,420
I would laugh so hard if it's, if I took control now and the first mission was to kill the guy in

166
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:17,349
the helicopter, the pilot fly over there. And I think I know why the constant has escaped.

167
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:21,910
He persuaded one of the sailors into setting him free. And since then he's been seizing

168
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:27,029
control of Providence assets and resources. I can only assume Carlisle is rushing to contain

169
00:22:27,029 --> 00:22:33,109
the damage. If she slips away again, we'll keep track of her. Make sure she doesn't make sure

170
00:22:33,109 --> 00:22:38,470
she doesn't get away and stays the same. Your destination is the sector. The world's tallest

171
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:42,869
building where the partners are laying low. Throw people off the building, right? Come on.

172
00:22:42,869 --> 00:22:48,950
Carl Ghazali. Marcus Stuyvesant is fifth generation old money. His family made its fortune

173
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:54,789
in real estate and banking and were at one point the chief landowners in New York. Carl Ingram is

174
00:22:54,789 --> 00:22:58,869
a powerful Washington kingmaker. I thought that was the one ring for a second. I'm like, holy

175
00:22:58,869 --> 00:23:04,150
shit. During the American civil war and later established a globe spanning empire in oil,

176
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:10,069
coal and steel. Both families long since retreated from public view, but their quiet dominance

177
00:23:10,069 --> 00:23:16,950
endures to this day. Now, the partners likely suspect that we're coming. So Mr. Gray will

178
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:22,390
infiltrate building controls and disable all electronic doors and elevators. Stuyvesant and

179
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:30,420
Ingram are about to find they have nowhere left to run. Lockdown is this one. How tall is this

180
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:37,000
building? This is our moment, 47. Providence ruined our lives with a flick of a pen. Today

181
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:46,440
we return the faith. Happy hunting. Mission active. Oh god, IO Interactive just fucking nails it

182
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:59,460
every time. All right, we got a target is Carl Ingram and Marcus Stuyvesant. Okay, kill conditions.

183
00:24:00,759 --> 00:24:03,960
Any method, any disguise. We're not doing any weird mischief. That's gonna play.

184
00:24:05,109 --> 00:24:13,029
Difficulty is on, uh, yeah, just professional. That's fine. Unlimited saves. We can just,

185
00:24:13,029 --> 00:24:16,230
story missions are there. I'm not playing on master. I just like walking around and strangling

186
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:27,289
people. All right, we just gotta kill these guys. You ready? Now I know what to say. Stuy?

187
00:24:27,289 --> 00:24:33,460
Professionals have standards. He's bad at the game. I haven't even pressed play yet.

188
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:42,730
I haven't even started playing. What are you talking about? All right, here's the real test.

189
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:48,309
Uh, is because my computer play this game and a big lead up leading to it. Let's see if I can

190
00:24:48,309 --> 00:25:00,460
stream the game. Welcome to Dubai. 47. Oh, look at those hot air balloons. Today is the inauguration

191
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:08,869
of the scepter and the ceremony is well underway. You will find me near the building's signature

192
00:25:08,869 --> 00:25:16,309
art installation. Well, apparently Carl Ingram has ensconced himself in his penthouse suite

193
00:25:16,309 --> 00:25:23,460
security on highest alert. Let's do like an alley hoop with a grenade, a floor under done. What?

194
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:32,420
Good luck. 47. Wait, what? 47. Oh my God. 47. Do you copy? I'm here. I will be shitting my

195
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:44,789
pants right now. Okay. Wait, I forget how to play hitman though. How do you play hitman?

196
00:25:45,430 --> 00:26:02,140
How do you play hitman? I don't even remember how to play. Can I climb this? You're a fake fan.

197
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:12,839
I needed like a, uh, I'll get it. No harness. No, why'd you? I have a parachute. What's in here?

198
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:21,190
That's a long way to go. Just do the joke already. I'm not gonna hold on. Oh, it's control. Right.

199
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:41,180
Control. You can see I snipe that guy. How do I stand up? X is climb. It's not C. Hang. All right.

200
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:50,420
And then scale. It's X is scale and climb and everything. Okay. I thought I missed. 47. Use

201
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:55,640
your camera and scan the lock, will you? I think I can override them. Use your camera? How do I

202
00:26:55,640 --> 00:27:04,920
stand up? Oh, C. Okay. You guys weren't lying. Equip your camera. Press or I to open your inventory.

203
00:27:06,119 --> 00:27:17,180
Camera. Aim at the camera. Are you fucking kidding me? No, they didn't. Did they, did they, did they

204
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:28,359
add this? They added a little like best buy all the way to the left camera. Are you serious? Holy

205
00:27:28,359 --> 00:27:38,920
shit. That's unbelievable. Okay. Can I do a, can you take a selfie? I hope you can take a selfie.

206
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:54,470
Oops. Hide menu. How do I navigate? Cancel. Z and X. Oh shit. Look at this one. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

207
00:27:59,799 --> 00:28:16,259
All right. Hold on. Let's do every single wedding invitation you've ever seen. And then of the top

208
00:28:16,259 --> 00:28:28,680
left here, there's like a photo of them like kissing at a movie theater. If it were me, if it

209
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:33,670
were me, they'd be like a guy in a groom outfit falling out of this balloon on the right. Just

210
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:38,150
like I'm falling out of the balloon and, and the whatever the bride would be. It's like screaming,

211
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:44,470
yelling like, oh, with like this terrified face and I'm falling. I'm like, at least what happened?

212
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:59,259
Did it upload that? Stop. What are you doing? What? What happened? It just went up to your Twitter.

213
00:29:00,809 --> 00:29:08,890
I get the camera out of here. There we go. Fiber wire. That's a sprint button. I'm in position. 47.

214
00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:14,730
The inauguration is taking place close by. Stop taking photos of shit. I'm sure there must be

215
00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:20,089
floor plans somewhere. Understood. We need absolute focus on this one. If Ingram and

216
00:29:20,089 --> 00:29:24,250
Stuyvesant are alerted to our presence, we may lose them for good. Oh, there's a coin over here.

217
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:38,140
We are so close, 47. Don't worry. I had to just see what it was like. Dude, you know what? I owe

218
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:42,940
interactive. I love you. You're like the best video game company. But let me do like, no, I don't want

219
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:47,079
to do that. I want to throw the coin to be able to throw people's eyes. I want to just be able to

220
00:29:47,079 --> 00:29:50,759
baseball complete pitchers, throw this into somebody's head and try to hit him in the eye.

221
00:29:50,759 --> 00:30:01,539
All right. That's what I would add. OK, here we go. But there's got to be a costume over here,

222
00:30:01,539 --> 00:30:12,420
right? Oh, his drinks. That's typically might be a little too high. This is normal for a guy to be

223
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:42,299
walking in like this. Oh, OK. OK, I'm sorry. Restart the mission. Did it not save? Yeah,

224
00:30:42,299 --> 00:31:01,049
this is for you. No, it didn't save, right? So I just restarted. Wait, just how do I die? Somebody

225
00:31:01,049 --> 00:31:33,960
kill me. Somebody kill me. Somebody kill me. Kill me. Kill me. Thank you. OK, here we go. Load.

226
00:31:36,809 --> 00:31:42,279
There we are. OK, let's go. You have to just punch somebody when you first. It's like GTA.

227
00:31:42,279 --> 00:31:48,730
The first 45 minutes that anybody plays Hitman, it's the first 45 minutes that you play GTA.

228
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:53,849
Don't lie to me. You run over the first person you see, you punch the first person in the face

229
00:31:53,849 --> 00:31:59,369
and you just shoot a rocket into the sky. That's what it hit, man. The first thing you do,

230
00:31:59,369 --> 00:32:04,039
punch the first person in the face, strangle the first person in the bathroom position.

231
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:10,039
And then you play the game close by. Once you've infiltrated it, get your bearings.

232
00:32:10,039 --> 00:32:15,720
I'm sure there must be floor plans somewhere. Understood. We need. You're a psychopath.

233
00:32:17,079 --> 00:32:24,390
No, and we all are. We may lose them for good. We are so close. 47. Don't worry. You're telling

234
00:32:24,390 --> 00:32:29,349
me the first thing you did in GTA 5 was not immediately punch the first pedestrian you

235
00:32:29,349 --> 00:32:40,700
find the first one immediately. No, would you would you stop at every red light?

236
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:52,569
All right, here we go. It's time. All right. So now we go. Here we go. What's this quicksave?

237
00:32:53,289 --> 00:33:15,380
What's quicksave? Is there no quicksave? Is it F5? I don't see it on here. It's F5 is there.

238
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:34,680
There is none. F5. It's not F5. Okay, here we go. Eliminate. Thank you. This is cool. All right.

239
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:48,259
Hold on. I need to change sensitivity. Way too high. Let's go with the 45. My most importantly.

240
00:33:48,259 --> 00:33:58,759
All right. Bright light. Holy shit. So we drink. You've served drinks. I'm trying to get a drink.

241
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:30,630
You have a tray of drinks. Was this weird if I come up to try to get one? What? Whoa. Sorry.

242
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:38,949
It's been. Look, it's been a couple of years. I need to. I'm going to do this. Welcome to the

243
00:34:38,949 --> 00:35:04,550
next like fucking six hours, guys. That wasn't the target. The bit rate is fucked. Is it? Oh,

244
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:07,590
because of the sun. I see. All right. So let's I'm going to I'm going to I have to be a good

245
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:13,690
at Hitman. I brought this up before. Playing Hitman the right way is like driving and stopping

246
00:35:13,690 --> 00:35:49,030
at every red light in GTA. It's very hard to do. Okay. Very cool. Thank you. All right.

247
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:55,880
Where we're looking for we're looking for an opportunity. Okay, back here. Let me just I'm

248
00:35:55,880 --> 00:36:10,170
going to schmooze for a little bit. You'll breathe one. Looking for an opportunity. Anybody have an

249
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:17,539
opportunity for me? What are they? What can I do with these? Can I walk up here? Is it allowed?

250
00:36:25,989 --> 00:36:29,420
Who's talking?

251
00:36:36,010 --> 00:36:45,989
This guy? I don't know. I don't know who is just talking. The guy in the jacket.

252
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:58,170
Okay, this guy is looking for private access to the guy's penthouse upstairs.

253
00:36:58,170 --> 00:37:03,590
I'm going to follow this guy around for a little bit. You have to subdue this guy.

254
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:11,159
Hold on. I have to know what the plan is. Kill him now. I'm not going to kill him now. I'm looking.

255
00:37:11,159 --> 00:37:24,710
You need I need an opportunity. Wait, so Whipple just guessed at the party. So he doesn't have

256
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:34,199
like special access to anything. Upstairs. Do you by any chance know who's staying here?

257
00:37:34,199 --> 00:37:41,110
You smoking here? I hear it's not just the world. Ask you politely to move along.

258
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:59,420
Is this guy a hitman too? We're both hitmen. Is this another player? 47. I would like to address

259
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:07,110
the Providence partners directly. What's this? Them to know why this is happening. And I have

260
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:13,130
an idea. But it requires you finding a map terminal. Wait, I can't just I was just about

261
00:38:13,130 --> 00:38:16,889
to just hold right trigger and just shoot a like I was gonna shoot that guy in the red dragon.

262
00:38:19,659 --> 00:38:27,670
Listen, I want to talk to the partners directly. Make them understand why all of this is happening.

263
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:34,949
And that terminal gives me an idea. Okay, there's a server room personal reception. If you can gain

264
00:38:34,949 --> 00:38:40,070
access to it, we might server room useful Intel from it. Okay, we'll have to work together to

265
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:45,349
hack the system. But it's our best. Is this person actually in my ear? Should I follow this one?

266
00:38:46,150 --> 00:39:05,159
Okay, we have bird of prey. Here we go. Let's follow this one. Let's do it. Interact with the

267
00:39:05,159 --> 00:39:18,329
map. Didn't I push button? Oh, it looks like the staff area could provide you with a viable route

268
00:39:18,329 --> 00:39:28,599
to the server. Push it harder. Okay, staff area. What do you got on yours? What iPad game do you

269
00:39:28,599 --> 00:39:54,500
have? Why can I? How do I get up? Get up? I can't get up. I can't get up. I can't get up.

270
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:22,809
Here it comes. No, I'm fine. I infiltrate the staff area. Wait, an apple. I eat it. It might

271
00:40:22,809 --> 00:40:25,769
be an opportunity that presents itself right there. Oh, you can throw an apple in somebody's

272
00:40:25,769 --> 00:40:42,489
face. Oh my god. Okay, I'm just gonna, I'm gonna bring an apple. I'm gonna go this way. Staff room

273
00:40:42,489 --> 00:40:47,940
I probably need a staff coat. There's a keypad lock on the doors to the staff area. That's the

274
00:40:47,940 --> 00:41:00,679
staff right there. One moment. All right, try this. 4706. 47. What are you doing? 47. Yeah,

275
00:41:00,679 --> 00:41:10,119
I have the code. 47. I don't know why you're doing this. I have the code. It's four. Okay.

276
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:22,460
You go to staff outfit. Nice job. Where's your code again? It's four. Uh, 47. What was the code?

277
00:41:23,019 --> 00:41:50,469
That's not it. How do I? What are the, what's the code? 47 something? 4708. It's not right. 4706.

278
00:41:51,269 --> 00:41:57,820
That's not it. Oh, it is. Okay, I have to press okay. There's quite a bit of security here.

279
00:41:59,130 --> 00:42:04,539
One moment. You ready for some more fresh air? 47. I got this cool costume now.

280
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:15,880
Wait, we have an opportunity. His highness has everyone working triple shifts. There's so much

281
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:20,760
going on here of a full staff update meetings already. And now that crazy manager called us

282
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:25,639
into another meeting. So now we've got to memorize new lists of guest names, new passwords for the

283
00:42:25,639 --> 00:42:31,320
terminals and new special dietary needs. Yep. What else? To the amount of information the human

284
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:38,280
brain can contain. What else? Pretty sure I've hit it. And to top it off. Don't forget that.

285
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:44,010
We wouldn't be getting overtime payment because we're just expected to be here. Can you believe this?

286
00:42:44,010 --> 00:42:51,130
Got a wrench over here? You got, you have to have a wrench in there, right? Oh, they don't,

287
00:42:51,130 --> 00:42:55,380
do they care? What if I, okay, they're not going to care, right? What if I need this for something?

288
00:42:57,320 --> 00:43:02,739
Just throw a cigarette on the ground. You just littered a cigarette. How do I like to,

289
00:43:02,739 --> 00:43:09,320
how do I go stop? You violated the law. Littering. That'll be 400 coin.

290
00:43:10,739 --> 00:43:19,579
Fuck you, guard. You were just watching. Oh my God. That was horrible.

291
00:43:40,630 --> 00:43:44,789
Don't mind me. I'm just getting a can. Oh, bathroom. Pog. Pog bathroom.

292
00:43:45,429 --> 00:43:56,539
Toilet control panel. Oh shit. What is malfunctioning? Is there a camera in the

293
00:43:56,539 --> 00:44:14,469
bathroom? I think that's stuck. I think that's going to be stuck there for a very long time.

294
00:44:15,429 --> 00:44:21,210
Can I plunge somebody? What? Wait, do you have a card? Oh, he's got something. What's this?

295
00:44:21,929 --> 00:44:36,380
He has some other stuff on him. I don't know why I was just trying to flush him down the toilet.

296
00:44:39,639 --> 00:45:18,780
Wait, people won't come in here now. Put it down. Good enough. No, no, no. Just, like I say, repent?

297
00:45:20,489 --> 00:45:36,920
Repent! Give me the axe. Wait, a pair of scissors too. I want those. All right,

298
00:45:36,920 --> 00:46:13,159
get in the server room. Fringe browsing. Okay. Well, would that just use the coin to do that?

299
00:46:13,719 --> 00:46:19,610
I think I can open that window remotely. Cool. All right, to do it with your camera and I'll have a

300
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:38,679
try. Camera, you got it. What is it? What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing?

301
00:46:43,510 --> 00:47:06,619
Okay. How do I get? How close can I get? Flash right in the face. How do I save this photo?

302
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:10,469
How do I save this photo?

303
00:47:13,980 --> 00:47:24,010
What kind of system is that? That all sounds pretty harmless.

304
00:47:24,010 --> 00:47:35,829
Wait, do they care that I'm doing this? They must not care, right? All right, they don't care.

305
00:47:40,329 --> 00:47:44,539
They're gonna watch me go out the window. I have to stop this from happening. Try to give them the...

306
00:47:45,099 --> 00:47:59,429
All right, leave, leave, leave, leave. Get out of here. Throw them out. No. Why would I do that?

307
00:47:59,989 --> 00:48:16,219
Because I'm not doing that. I don't need to. I want that axe though. What the fuck? Give me the axe.

308
00:48:17,019 --> 00:48:22,920
Cheek Al-Ghazali is reaching out to his worldwide network of lawyers and financial contacts,

309
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:27,960
attempting to restore the lost power base of the Providence partners. How do I turn this on?

310
00:48:28,599 --> 00:48:33,719
If Ingram and Stuyvesant were asked to a meeting, thinking they'll be told of new developments,

311
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:38,360
I suspect they'd jump at the chance. Is there ray tracing? I don't have a 10... I have a...

312
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:44,039
I have 1080. It can be sealed off for private conversations. If we lure the targets there,

313
00:48:44,679 --> 00:48:59,239
they'll be trapped. Okay. Got it. I can't take it with me, so I might as well throw it over there.

314
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:29,800
Okay, take the scenic route. Holy shit, he's right there. All right. Shit. Whatever. What am I

315
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:46,139
supposed to do on this ledge over here? Get... What am I supposed to do? I can't get on this ledge?

316
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:56,090
Use the camera. I don't have to go down there? What am I... What's the point of this?

317
00:49:57,750 --> 00:50:19,820
What? What's the point of this? What... I... What was the point of doing this? Other ledge? Use camera.

318
00:50:19,820 --> 00:50:26,809
Use camera. On the other one? Use camera on the... Oh, shit. Neanderthals just came in with a raid.

319
00:50:26,809 --> 00:50:34,679
What's going on, Neanderthals? It's me, German985. I hope you had a good stream, Neanderthals.

320
00:50:34,679 --> 00:50:52,360
Maybe go the right way. Hold on. Apology raid? Why is there an apology raid? Apology raid? I hope

321
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:59,769
you had fun in whatever you're doing. Always... Always a welcome... Welcome presence, Neanderthals.

322
00:50:59,769 --> 00:51:18,389
Sing the raid song. Uh-oh. This is like the part of the live concert where the singer, like,

323
00:51:18,389 --> 00:51:23,769
is just waiting for the time to come in, and they kind of forget the fucking lyrics,

324
00:51:23,769 --> 00:51:27,780
and the whole band is playing the intro, and the singer's just kind of dancing around.

325
00:51:32,869 --> 00:51:34,070
It's like, come on, do it!

326
00:51:40,099 --> 00:51:46,059
The singer goes over to the fucking guitarist and starts, like, hamming his head back and forth,

327
00:51:46,059 --> 00:51:49,980
and the guy's just fucking doing a crazy riff, and he's just begging. He leans back and he

328
00:51:49,980 --> 00:51:51,739
whispers, like, fucking, come on, man, this is killing me.

329
00:52:03,670 --> 00:52:19,539
It's always... Where do I go? Where do I go? Where do I go? I don't know what to do. I'm so stupid.

330
00:52:20,659 --> 00:52:35,079
Vault? I know, but I can't... I'm trying to grab this ledge over here.

331
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:40,340
Wouldn't this be the scenic route over here? I can't grab this ledge.

332
00:52:41,579 --> 00:52:55,000
Viewers gone? Oh, whatever. I can't drop here. Look up. I shouldn't be able to... What the fuck?

333
00:52:58,519 --> 00:53:17,500
What? Why can I not figure this out? So, I don't... Why can I not do this? Just keep going left?

334
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:23,210
I can't. Tell me about that, right? I would assume to climb that and grab that and shimmy.

335
00:53:24,010 --> 00:53:46,440
Climb this and shimmy this way? Okay. He did it. Well, we got a raid came in, too. I'm sorry.

336
00:53:47,400 --> 00:54:04,199
A raid came in. I had to sing the raid song. Oh, my God. That's horrible. Look at this zonked brain.

337
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:10,940
So, it's the raid's fault. I didn't say that. I just said I had to sing the raid song.

338
00:54:10,940 --> 00:54:30,679
I can't save on the pole. All right. Scan it. Shit. I didn't get it. I want to save point right here.

339
00:54:37,210 --> 00:54:43,699
Blend in. Okay. Server room is behind... We got a guy over there that can see through my disguise,

340
00:54:43,699 --> 00:54:54,969
though. Do I have... We got two guys over here. We got toilet three. I don't have to do that.

341
00:54:57,619 --> 00:55:06,059
Okay. Toilet in here. Turn on the sink and seal. No, I don't... What do I have for items? Oh,

342
00:55:06,059 --> 00:55:14,059
I have a soda. What the... What's that? What's that? What's that green stuff? There's a camera

343
00:55:14,059 --> 00:55:21,619
right there, isn't there? Does it matter if I get seen on the camera? Oh, shit. All right. Hold on.

344
00:55:26,550 --> 00:55:37,860
What? Oh, shit. What? It was full? I thought it was an empty can. Are you serious? Okay. Well,

345
00:55:38,420 --> 00:56:13,659
who's in here? Oh, all right. Hold on. I can... Where do I put him? He was thinking. Oh, janitor key.

346
00:56:13,659 --> 00:56:18,840
So now I'm the janitor. All right. We're going to find that server room is not... This is not... Oh,

347
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:30,780
it's right here. Nice. Okay. Save it. Terminal is locked. Can he do it? Can he do anything about

348
00:56:30,780 --> 00:56:37,860
this? Hmm.

349
00:56:44,820 --> 00:56:55,349
Okay. Pull one of the racks. How about this one? Wait. This is sabotage on 1080. Let's go.

350
00:56:55,989 --> 00:57:10,519
People hear this? Who hears this? Oh, thanks. Where am I supposed to hide? I can't even hide

351
00:57:10,519 --> 00:57:47,400
in here. What? What? How do you not know? How does he not know? How did he not know? What?

352
00:57:47,400 --> 00:58:48,630
What? Let me see how the gunplay is in this one. Where'd he go? Okay. I got to clean this

353
00:58:48,630 --> 00:58:55,820
up a little. This is a little too much. Clean this up. Just dump them. Is there a party still

354
00:58:55,820 --> 00:59:23,219
going on here? He's still falling? How far is that? How did he land? He landed right on the

355
00:59:23,219 --> 00:59:34,010
crown of his head and stayed that way? Oh, I got the penthouse card. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh,

356
00:59:34,010 --> 00:59:36,570
shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on.

357
00:59:36,570 --> 00:59:54,570
Over here. Over here. Over here. Hey. I don't think I will. I don't think I will drop the scissors.

358
00:59:55,210 --> 01:00:13,989
Oh, shit. My stomach. I just let him punch me in the face as hard as he could.

359
01:00:14,389 --> 01:00:25,739
Oh, shit. I flinched a little too. Oh, my God. It's time to drop the scissors. Oh, that was

360
01:00:25,739 --> 01:00:36,340
fucking funny. I love this game. All right. Let's go. I'm going to try. Okay. Let's pull this out.

361
01:00:36,340 --> 01:01:00,739
Oh, get me out. Get me out. How do I hide? How am I supposed to hide? Fuck. There's no cabinet

362
01:01:00,739 --> 01:02:12,699
or anything. Oh, I'm putting my hands up. No shit. They're gone. Oh, wait. Is this going to kill him?

363
01:02:27,909 --> 01:02:46,230
What? Oh, my God. I can't be trusted. Just pull the server out. All right. I'm playing the game for

364
01:02:46,230 --> 01:02:55,159
real now. I'm not. I'm playing the game for real. Let's go. Play the game for real. Leave the room.

365
01:02:57,400 --> 01:03:00,780
I'm going to play the game for real. No more fucking around. I promise. I'm going to get to

366
01:03:00,780 --> 01:03:05,099
the end of this. I'm going to get to the end of this mission. I promise. Yes. 47. Pull one of them.

367
01:03:05,099 --> 01:03:05,739
And I'm going to run out.

368
01:03:14,380 --> 01:03:18,460
A silent alarm has been tripped. Security is on its way. Hide 47.

369
01:03:54,019 --> 01:04:06,969
Nice stormtrooper aim. Did he look in the toilet? You looked in the toilet. You looked in the toilet.

370
01:04:06,969 --> 01:04:13,610
Like he could be in the toilet. I mean, they probably heard a ton of stories about this guy.

371
01:04:13,610 --> 01:04:19,349
He can be anybody. He can be anything. He can be any object. They probably think I can be objects.

372
01:04:19,989 --> 01:04:35,690
Okay. Am I good? He's down there. All right. Hold on. I got to get the penthouse key.

373
01:04:36,250 --> 01:04:44,179
I got to get one of these guys in this room. Get out before they come. Wait, what?

374
01:04:44,900 --> 01:05:12,780
Oh, get back in. Get back in. Get back in. Check the toilet again. Was it too late?

375
01:05:12,780 --> 01:05:40,920
There's a guy. Who's that guy in there? Fuck. Did I? Yes. Sorry about that, 47. Let's try again,

376
01:05:40,920 --> 01:05:48,969
shall we? I think I've got it. We'll need a key card to gain access. Someone in maintenance should

377
01:05:48,969 --> 01:06:00,170
have one we can borrow first. I have one. Don't I have one? I don't have a card. I am maintenance.

378
01:06:04,860 --> 01:06:45,369
I'm compromised though. I need to reload the safe. No, not yet. He doesn't hear this. Come here.

379
01:06:45,369 --> 01:07:03,610
All right. We're good. We're good. We're good. We're good. Put him in here. Take his gun. Body

380
01:07:03,610 --> 01:07:10,519
hidden. All right. I'm good. Let me take the gun. Does he have a card too or anything? All right.

381
01:07:10,519 --> 01:07:21,690
We got the gun. How do you holster? Okay. H. Save it. All right. Into the maintenance room.

382
01:07:21,690 --> 01:07:31,940
Get a maintenance key. Do not throw this guy off the edge. It was an insane idea to start with.

383
01:07:31,940 --> 01:07:39,380
Come on. Exploding golf ball. I've never taken things to such an extreme before.

384
01:07:39,380 --> 01:07:56,280
Let's see. I, but no, but I know I have it. Fuck this guy too. No, I need his key. I need his key.

385
01:07:57,159 --> 01:08:14,840
Oh, I got it. All right. We're good. All right. The people down on the first floor right now

386
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:20,600
are probably just like, um, this is a really nice party, but people keep coming, keep falling from

387
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:25,079
second floor. I think that's something we should probably look into. That must have done something.

388
01:08:25,079 --> 01:08:40,470
Can you see anything different in the room? Um, is it the letters? The letters lit up. R. O. A. D.

389
01:08:40,470 --> 01:09:07,060
Road. It's the screens or the A. M. M. Row. Rome. More. M. O. A. R. More. O. M. A. R. Okay. We're

390
01:09:07,060 --> 01:09:50,199
doing it in this order, right? Oh, I'm a guard too. Fuck it. I can keep going. I can't. Oh, A. M.

391
01:09:51,609 --> 01:10:01,939
A. M. R. More. Look at the screens. Video feed. Downloading video feed. Monitoring server disabled.

392
01:10:01,939 --> 01:10:20,869
Body. Monitoring server disabled. Did I do it? What about this screen? Open.

393
01:10:21,029 --> 01:10:29,260
Reinforcements are incoming. More guards on their way. Look on top. Yeah. Is it the letters?

394
01:10:29,979 --> 01:10:43,670
Central processing unit. Oh, do I have to spell somebody's name? M. O. A. R. More. Guards are on

395
01:10:43,670 --> 01:11:03,510
their way. Spell Andy. A. N. D. Y. More guards. Get reload on that. Nice. Okay. Okay. There we are.

396
01:11:07,189 --> 01:11:12,659
One of the screens. This screen is different. It's this one. It's this one. The screen is

397
01:11:12,659 --> 01:11:31,979
different. It's this one. Pre-order the schedule. Oh, shit. Rearrange the meetings. Meeting time

398
01:11:31,979 --> 01:11:44,729
updated. When? Oh, shit. Really? Wait. Turn all the cameras off too. Andy?

399
01:11:46,170 --> 01:11:58,699
What? Open all the doors. And deposit emergency funds. What happened? A bunch of gold bars just

400
01:11:58,699 --> 01:12:05,430
came out of that. What happened? Did I just make a frenzy at the first floor? All right. Wait. I gotta

401
01:12:05,430 --> 01:12:25,859
go to the meeting. Save it. Save it. Save it. Save it. Okay. Go to the meeting. Shit. I gotta get in

402
01:12:25,859 --> 01:12:39,609
there. Shit. Conference room. These guys see through my disguise. Oh, fuck. Okay. We're good.

403
01:12:39,609 --> 01:12:54,149
You don't have to search me, right? Oh, thank God. Oh, my God. There he is. There he is. Get a

404
01:12:54,149 --> 01:13:14,250
chainsaw and cut the tree down and drop the tree on his head. Save it here. Nice. Hey, I'm with him.

405
01:13:14,810 --> 01:13:32,739
We're together. I'm his personal bodyguard. Martin, would you like an apple? I know you love the

406
01:13:32,739 --> 01:13:40,859
golden delicious. I do too. We'll just wait for the partners to be alone. Then you can activate

407
01:13:40,859 --> 01:13:47,020
the room's lockdown feature. I can? How do I? Wait, both of them are in the same room.

408
01:13:47,020 --> 01:13:54,250
The partners are alone now. Activate the panel controlling the room. That doesn't matter. The

409
01:13:54,250 --> 01:13:59,930
panel doesn't matter, dude. The panel doesn't matter. Use it to start the show. I don't care

410
01:13:59,930 --> 01:14:04,489
about the panel. I just want to. No, no, no, no, no, no. I want to drop the chandelier on his head.

411
01:14:05,050 --> 01:14:30,920
In any other way. Come on, hurry. How do I drop that? At this time in particular,

412
01:14:30,920 --> 01:14:36,869
we need a solid foundation to rebuild from and someone to help us hit that traitor, Edward.

413
01:14:38,119 --> 01:14:46,600
Shoot it? Oh, he'll get coming to him. You know, Marcus, my father taught me many things throughout

414
01:14:46,600 --> 01:15:01,430
my life. Oh, what happened? Are you guys all right down there? Oh, this. This shaky building. New

415
01:15:01,430 --> 01:15:17,829
construction. Brand new. Oh, quick. Play the piano before anybody figures it out. Carry on

416
01:15:17,829 --> 01:15:53,060
with the meeting. I'll take care of the rest. Nice family guy joke. Wait. That's just at my mercy?

417
01:15:58,899 --> 01:16:26,300
I can't just stand up from behind this vertical video. Really, Carl? You're making us look real

418
01:16:26,300 --> 01:16:52,170
shitty here. Can't even save it. Zoom call. I kind of want to hit him with the apple and then let

419
01:16:52,170 --> 01:17:06,460
him get up and go. He turned off the video. OK, right now, he threw the apple at him. Why did

420
01:17:06,460 --> 01:17:19,029
you throw that apple at me? That was ridiculous. He's dead. Oh, I just skipped it. Does he fight

421
01:17:19,029 --> 01:17:33,989
back? Hey, it's me, 47. You're trapped in here with me. I'll tell you what happened. He is dead.

422
01:17:38,869 --> 01:17:53,800
Touch that. Oh, shit. He touched it. Get rid of the exit quick. Give me the exit.

423
01:18:02,180 --> 01:18:11,430
I thought I locked it. I thought I had it locked down. Oh, Jesus. All it took was for him to kick

424
01:18:11,510 --> 01:18:39,300
it and all the panels come back up. Tell me what to fucking do. Why did I do that?

425
01:18:40,979 --> 01:19:17,850
Just go to the meeting already. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You're so bad at

426
01:19:17,850 --> 01:19:26,979
this. I just need to press buttons and throw things. All right, let's go. Agent 47 IQ.

427
01:19:31,829 --> 01:19:43,109
You have a monkey brain. Yeah, I know. You guys know this. So I can do this cleanly by just

428
01:19:43,109 --> 01:20:01,350
dropping the chandelier on them. Are they going to shimmy around? Fuck. Don't get spotted. How

429
01:20:01,350 --> 01:20:09,380
you doing? There's a chef. There's a chef over here. Hold on. There's a chef over there, dude.

430
01:20:30,460 --> 01:20:36,819
Inhale sharply and you're gonna lose consciousness because of your proximity

431
01:20:36,819 --> 01:20:40,739
to me. There won't be enough oxygen within this square meter in order. I just want a bottle of

432
01:20:40,739 --> 01:20:49,539
water. Who do you want to serve? Am I playing Skyrim? Why am I just taking everything in this

433
01:20:49,539 --> 01:21:17,800
guy's room? Okay, I got what I wanted. Just keep calm. It's a busy day for surely we can get.

434
01:21:19,159 --> 01:21:38,020
What's this? Do that. I certainly did. What's the meaning of this? You. You are the one

435
01:21:38,020 --> 01:21:46,180
responsible for all this. And the layer meat on the chandelier meat on the chandelier.

436
01:21:49,350 --> 01:22:04,840
Just wait. Wait, wait, wait. Drop the chandelier. But oh, do it now. What is this?

437
01:22:07,720 --> 01:22:19,029
Model of the scepter. That's a meat. Shoot it. But I don't want to activate the. Won't they hear

438
01:22:19,029 --> 01:22:25,819
this? What the fuck? No,

439
01:22:47,800 --> 01:23:07,560
what do you mean reset? I disguised as him. It hasn't been noticed. Shoot the chandelier. Yeah,

440
01:23:07,640 --> 01:23:11,659
I did. And it didn't do anything. It just like bounced off the metal. I wanted to hit him with

441
01:23:11,659 --> 01:23:28,579
a bone too. Damn it. We meant the string. Yeah, I didn't know if it was the hit box would be on

442
01:23:28,579 --> 01:23:35,859
the actual chandelier part too. Oh, let me drink some of that whiskey. Drop them behind the TV.

443
01:23:36,500 --> 01:23:44,890
Okay, I have to get out of here. Will they see the blood on the ground? What if I turn that?

444
01:23:44,890 --> 01:23:53,289
Wait, I didn't even get to use this. All right, I'll hold it. I can't save it. How do I get out of

445
01:23:53,289 --> 01:24:54,739
here? I'm okay. No, just go. Oh shit. I'm close. Almost there. Nobody over here, right? Oh, I open

446
01:24:54,739 --> 01:25:35,260
the elevator. That's right. Nice. Okay, cool. Did I go too far? Oh, I did it wrong floor.

447
01:25:35,260 --> 01:25:55,260
This one here. Oh, it's right here. Wait, what? Wait, why is this right here? It's right here,

448
01:25:55,260 --> 01:26:07,159
right? That's the button. You have to press the elevator button. The elevator is already open.

449
01:26:07,159 --> 01:26:32,970
What? The elevator is open. I have to press the elevator button. Oh my god. He didn't even know.

450
01:26:32,970 --> 01:26:48,390
How did you? It was you. Give me a break. I thought I just have to walk in. Really? I walked in there.

451
01:26:48,390 --> 01:26:59,590
I had to hold G on the elevator button. I thought I was going to be just to walk in and it would be

452
01:26:59,590 --> 01:27:14,619
like, oh, you did it with the cut scene. Yeah, that's my name. I've never played Fortnite even

453
01:27:14,619 --> 01:27:36,100
for one minute. Not one single fucking minute. Nice. All right, that was fun. A new melee. A

454
01:27:36,100 --> 01:27:53,989
hidden stash in the kitchen. A man behind the curtain. That's your winning face. I'd hate to

455
01:27:53,989 --> 01:28:01,109
see you lose. We underestimated the constant. Now he's a glorified desk clerk. He's not just after

456
01:28:01,109 --> 01:28:07,899
the money. He wants it all. Anyone's feeling they eventually keep her supplement is going to replace

457
01:28:07,899 --> 01:28:17,239
him. Well, we're not the ones who let him escape. You still don't trust her. I don't like executive

458
01:28:17,239 --> 01:28:28,199
decision makers. Look, you don't have to follow her. You know, soon this will be over. This is

459
01:28:28,199 --> 01:28:32,920
2021 game. Maybe it's time to think about the future. Get out of here. You have to face the

460
01:28:32,920 --> 01:28:39,880
possibility that what a way to ruin a cut scene. The ICA knows what you did. She'll make it right.

461
01:28:40,600 --> 01:28:48,819
Oh my god, dude. Okay, that's the same exact thing. It just completely pulls you out.

462
01:28:49,460 --> 01:28:54,260
We're at like a fast food restaurant and they have one of those digital menus and the Windows

463
01:28:54,260 --> 01:29:01,289
update restart. Please continue thing is in the middle. It's just that's not supposed to be there.

464
01:29:01,289 --> 01:29:08,939
You just completely remove me from my fast food environment. Okay, well, whatever. This is death

465
01:29:08,939 --> 01:29:37,640
and the family. It's time to put the scissors down. I can't even. I keep thinking about that.

466
01:29:38,279 --> 01:29:49,529
You tend to be reminded of what truly matters. So the end of the line. You ready for this?

467
01:29:51,000 --> 01:30:00,500
Are you who will you be without a score to settle? I guess the world's most wanted fugitive

468
01:30:00,500 --> 01:30:12,100
will have to do Alexa Christine Carly see Alexa Carlisle is dead. According to the funeral

469
01:30:12,100 --> 01:30:17,539
invitation that is so naturally it caused quite a stir when the late matriarch turned up at the

470
01:30:17,539 --> 01:30:23,300
breakfast table alive and kicking. So now we have to kill her. Why is that a number is up

471
01:30:23,380 --> 01:30:27,380
has emerged from exile to tie up loose ends and secure the Carlisle legacy.

472
01:30:28,020 --> 01:30:34,420
She may be a monster, but you have to admire her due diligence. Carlisle descends from an ancient

473
01:30:34,420 --> 01:30:39,699
line of warrior aristocrats. Her great grandfather made a killing in the second opium war and

474
01:30:39,699 --> 01:30:45,539
established an empire and shipping railroads and newspaper publishing while largely unknown to the

475
01:30:45,539 --> 01:30:51,619
public. The family still asserts its quiet dominance over global transport and logistics, media and

476
01:30:51,619 --> 01:30:59,539
technology. Most senior of the partners, Alexa Carlisle is cold as ice, tough as nails and sharp

477
01:30:59,539 --> 01:31:05,220
as a razor. But an apple will do as always father who first brought the three families together

478
01:31:05,220 --> 01:31:11,619
after the end of world war two at this very house. Meaning that this gentleman is the birthplace of

479
01:31:11,699 --> 01:31:12,340
Providence.

480
01:31:13,619 --> 01:31:20,180
Why is it on fire? It began here and it ends here. Manch, we're doing like a big mansion mission.

481
01:31:21,350 --> 01:31:27,270
One more thing. According to our intel, Carlisle keeps a case file on the constant information that

482
01:31:27,270 --> 01:31:32,470
may be helpful in his recapture. So eliminate the estate without it. Alexa Carlisle. Right.

483
01:31:33,510 --> 01:31:36,710
Happy hunting 47. See you on the other side.

484
01:31:36,710 --> 01:31:56,899
Hmm. Cool. Alexa Carlisle. Find the case file and eliminate Alexa Carlisle. Hmm. Okay. Hmm.

485
01:31:58,810 --> 01:32:09,930
I want coins. Coins. Smuggled item. I want I don't have any unlocks. Classic outfit.

486
01:32:12,890 --> 01:32:24,920
Oats. Yeah. Listen, I like that. I like the way it looks. Let's go. It's a spooky mansion.

487
01:32:26,100 --> 01:32:35,659
Like the spooky mansion atmosphere. This looks fun. I like when they're self-contained in one

488
01:32:35,659 --> 01:32:42,619
spot. Give me that fucking motorcycle please. The revenant Alexa Carlisle and her three adult

489
01:32:42,619 --> 01:32:48,140
children. You skipped a mission. What? Grandson and daughter-in-law are all gathered to conduct

490
01:32:48,140 --> 01:32:55,260
Carlisle's sham funeral. How? Curiously, Carlisle summoned a famous London PI soon after arriving

491
01:32:55,260 --> 01:33:01,260
this morning. But his purpose at Thornbridge is yet unclear. Now, the target knows that you're

492
01:33:01,260 --> 01:33:06,220
coming and her guard detail is top- Hmm. Cause she knows I'm on the way. So Mr. Gray will secure

493
01:33:06,220 --> 01:33:12,220
their nearby field HQ and intercept all calls going in and out of the estate. Any appeal for

494
01:33:12,220 --> 01:33:19,479
backup is going to fall on very deaf ears. Good luck, gentlemen. No. Give me that motorcycle.

495
01:33:20,359 --> 01:33:43,079
Please. Please. Oh, no. Please. Oh, this is gorgeous. This is beautiful. This is really,

496
01:33:43,079 --> 01:33:54,619
really pretty. All right. The PI. Is he going to come take a piss or something?

497
01:34:01,529 --> 01:34:06,729
So disguises as Carlisle this morning. Take the car disguise and like walk through the gate

498
01:34:06,729 --> 01:34:22,229
and just be like, interesting. Okay. A famous private investigator summoned by Alexa.

499
01:34:22,229 --> 01:34:27,510
It's all the mystery. Has arrived at Thornbridge Manor. If you take his place, it may be an

500
01:34:27,510 --> 01:34:35,060
opportunity to get close to Madam Carlisle. Okay. I like that. But, oh, okay. I'm going to go. I'm

501
01:34:35,060 --> 01:34:49,270
going to get him. Excuse me. Excuse me. Uh, Tom. Tom. I'm such a huge fan of your work.

502
01:34:52,010 --> 01:34:57,779
Oh, fuck. I'm trying to get. Oh, don't come. Don't come over here.

503
01:34:57,779 --> 01:35:04,890
Don't come over. Where's my coin? I need a coin. Oh, come on, dude.

504
01:35:22,170 --> 01:35:33,399
Just like, come on. Where? I didn't get a safe slot. Whatever. I can't walk across the water.

505
01:35:33,399 --> 01:35:37,239
I can't like step into the little river. I can't. Why can I not walk in that?

506
01:35:37,960 --> 01:35:46,170
It's an invisible wall. I can't walk in the water. What do you mean? Jesus. No, I'm talking about

507
01:35:46,170 --> 01:35:49,939
dunking. I can't like dunk in here. I can't walk in here and dunk in this.

508
01:35:49,939 --> 01:36:02,569
Why? All right. Let me get in front of him. All right. Two guards over there. Let me save that

509
01:36:02,569 --> 01:36:19,180
right here. Check this out. What have we got? These guys over here. Famous. Yeah. I'm going to try

510
01:36:19,180 --> 01:36:51,380
to get his autograph. He's famous. Okay. Save it right here. What just happened? You can see

511
01:36:51,380 --> 01:37:18,979
me right now? Fuck. Hold on. I mean, you. Both of you should go. What the fuck? I can cross the

512
01:37:18,979 --> 01:37:34,390
river? What? I tried to do that earlier. What the fuck? All right. The hedge guy. Hedge bushers.

513
01:37:34,390 --> 01:37:48,619
The hedge trimmer. Come over here. You can see through the bushes? Just like scoop them up?

514
01:37:49,579 --> 01:37:54,520
Oh, shit. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

515
01:37:54,520 --> 01:38:31,270
Is that guy going to see? Grab him. No. Oh, I'm fine. Maybe the hedges. Where are the trimmers?

516
01:38:31,829 --> 01:38:37,500
Where are the trimmers? Where are they? He had hedge trimmers on him. Where are they?

517
01:38:37,500 --> 01:38:43,659
No, I need to be you. I need to be you. I need to be you. I need to be you. I need to be that guy.

518
01:38:49,909 --> 01:39:08,779
Nice work. I work here, though. Okay. That was very, very. Okay.

519
01:39:10,199 --> 01:39:15,060
That was extreme change in. I guess we have a history.

520
01:39:20,060 --> 01:39:25,579
But don't go in the window. It's right over here. Open. Complete fucking security hole.

521
01:39:34,680 --> 01:39:45,350
What are you looking at? Who's looking at me? Shut the fuck up. Oh, my God. He saw.

522
01:39:47,350 --> 01:39:51,619
Was it a butler? It was the butler. It was the butler. It was the butler. It was the butler.

523
01:39:51,619 --> 01:39:55,619
It was the butler. We're good. We're good. We're fine. We're fine. We're fine. Oh, shit.

524
01:39:55,619 --> 01:40:07,939
It was the mother of worker or something. I don't know. What? My computer's hard crashing.

525
01:40:07,939 --> 01:40:11,539
My computer's hard. I think my computer's turning off. My computer's turning off.

526
01:40:19,899 --> 01:40:30,810
What the hell happened? Everything just crashed. My computer did. What the fuck?

527
01:40:31,449 --> 01:40:45,140
You ripped too big of a hole. Oh, okay. Let me restart it. I couldn't even see an indicator

528
01:40:45,140 --> 01:40:53,029
on my screen. I have a thing where it shows my mic level. My mic level shows up, right?

529
01:40:55,579 --> 01:41:09,050
That wasn't even visible anymore. Everything turned off. Okay. Well, let's try that again.

530
01:41:09,609 --> 01:41:21,819
You are online. I don't want to be online. Sign up. Don't ever ask me again.

531
01:41:27,579 --> 01:41:41,029
Death and family. Okay, let's go. Load game, right? Just load game. What the hell is load game?

532
01:41:54,380 --> 01:42:04,619
Age up? Oh, okay. How far away was this? Oh, okay. Now it's right here. We're fine.

533
01:42:05,420 --> 01:42:18,060
Oh, that was the lady. I thought that was another worker at the hotel or the mansion. I thought it

534
01:42:18,060 --> 01:42:49,479
was a worker. Idiot. What does he have on him? What do you have on you? Anything? No. All right.

535
01:42:49,479 --> 01:42:53,909
Where do I hide him? In that little closet? Somebody's going to see over here. What's in

536
01:42:53,909 --> 01:43:08,680
here? Can I dump him in here? I'm going to dump you in here. Come here. Where can I put him?

537
01:43:08,680 --> 01:43:21,159
Break open the... No, no, no. Where can I dump him? Does anybody come in here for any reason?

538
01:43:21,239 --> 01:43:45,050
Whoa. All right. Well, window, window, window. No, not window. There's a guy right here. This

539
01:43:45,050 --> 01:44:13,770
is the only guy. Won't he see? Okay. I think I'm all right. I can't walk around with a saber,

540
01:44:13,770 --> 01:44:22,810
but I feel like if I was like a really esteemed private eye, I probably would. Can I just pretend

541
01:44:22,810 --> 01:44:42,539
to be Indiana Jones or something? Meet Alex in the foyer. Oh, wait. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

542
01:44:42,539 --> 01:45:00,409
I'm here. Sure. Whatever you need, I can do it.

543
01:45:00,729 --> 01:45:20,380
I am Mr. Fernsby the butler. Hello, Fernsby.

544
01:45:23,100 --> 01:45:26,859
How are you? Mr. Whitmer, I understand that you've traveled to London.

545
01:45:26,859 --> 01:46:05,380
Do I care? I am Mr. Fernsby the butler. Madam Carlisle has asked me to assist you in any way.

546
01:46:05,380 --> 01:46:10,250
I could have just followed her up. I understand that you've traveled from London. Would you care

547
01:46:10,250 --> 01:46:13,210
for some refreshments? I didn't have to listen to her. Would you prefer to go straight to Mr.

548
01:46:13,210 --> 01:46:20,949
Zachary's sleeping quarters? Hmm. I would. I prefer to get started as you wish. If you'll

549
01:46:20,949 --> 01:46:39,399
follow me, sir. Wait, like I was going up here anyways. I feel obliged to point out the current

550
01:46:39,399 --> 01:46:44,180
affairs surrounding Madam Carlisle are of a delicate nature. Are these her kids?

551
01:46:44,180 --> 01:46:49,210
You may be familiar with the recent announcement. Are these you? You'll probably learn that the

552
01:46:49,210 --> 01:46:55,420
stage show is scheduled to take place tomorrow. Adam's children were not informed until this

553
01:46:55,420 --> 01:47:03,050
morning at all. Wow. So please bear with them if they seem affected by the situation.

554
01:47:03,050 --> 01:47:14,920
Are they in the house? Wences gets out of them. Consider her dead when I leave.

555
01:47:16,470 --> 01:47:21,829
And I nudge him really fucking hard into his waist and I wink a shitload of times.

556
01:47:21,829 --> 01:47:32,090
The case concerns the death of Mr. Zachary. He was found dead in his bed this morning.

557
01:47:32,090 --> 01:47:37,210
Really? The door was locked from the inside and a suicide letter was found in his room.

558
01:47:38,729 --> 01:47:45,180
Interesting. Madam Carlisle suspects Fowl did not accept that he took his own life.

559
01:47:45,180 --> 01:47:48,779
Sure. I've prepared some information for you. I have to do some detective work. So please do come

560
01:47:48,779 --> 01:47:53,979
and see me when you've finished your investigation of the crime scene. This is Mr. Zachary's room,

561
01:47:53,979 --> 01:48:06,020
to my right. Okay. Holy shit, I was gonna say disappeared. A locked room murder mystery 47.

562
01:48:06,020 --> 01:48:09,300
Hmm. I trust you'll get to the bottom of this. It's a murder mystery?

563
01:48:10,699 --> 01:48:16,779
If it don't, I end up being the murderer at the end anyways. I'm the killer. Oh, what a twist.

564
01:48:16,779 --> 01:48:23,619
Somebody in here. Why don't you use your camera to scan the dead body? Oh, this person's dead.

565
01:48:29,739 --> 01:48:38,170
Tell me what happened to him. Throat markings indicate a rare short-lived spread shows time

566
01:48:38,170 --> 01:48:45,909
of death at around this night. Do you know your poisons 47? Okay. We're looking for poison.

567
01:48:45,909 --> 01:48:53,899
There it is right here. He must have drank out of that. Just check that for poison. Whiskey glass

568
01:48:53,899 --> 01:48:59,220
and bottle found on Zachary Carlisle's bedside table. What else is down here?

569
01:49:01,829 --> 01:49:07,899
Oh, there's a fresh fire. This is very recent. There's a fresh fire over here.

570
01:49:08,460 --> 01:49:24,439
It's fresh wood. Computer. Yep. What was the last email he sent? Zachary was shopping for

571
01:49:24,439 --> 01:49:30,600
new Wellingtons last night. Not exactly what you would expect from someone suicidal. Interesting.

572
01:49:30,600 --> 01:49:45,500
Okay. Interesting. Very interesting. How much is his horn tabs? Who's this? Who's this person?

573
01:49:45,500 --> 01:49:59,500
Are you supposed to be the one that's like guarding this guy all night? Who are you? What about out

574
01:49:59,500 --> 01:50:05,079
here? A lot of booze. That's pretty much. Oh, that's pretty. That's really pretty.

575
01:50:05,800 --> 01:50:21,460
Get me out of here before I do something stupid. What else is there? Oh, this looks like it

576
01:50:21,460 --> 01:50:35,699
can be opened. Let me tell you guys something. Let me give you guys a little bit of advice.

577
01:50:36,579 --> 01:50:46,310
If your Tinder profile is all this, delete them all now. Right now. Delete them all. You're going

578
01:50:46,310 --> 01:50:57,430
to need a few different photos. This is a swipe. This is a swipe left. It just is. Set it up. Take

579
01:50:57,430 --> 01:51:05,850
a photo. Take a selfie. The camera in the mirror is just. There's an immediate swipe left. I don't

580
01:51:05,850 --> 01:51:09,449
have to tell you that. You should know that by now. Especially if it looks like this too.

581
01:51:19,180 --> 01:51:41,029
You'd be a really bad wingman. Hold on. Wait. Wait. Let's get this right. Perfect. I don't even know

582
01:51:41,029 --> 01:51:49,579
what the hell you look like. Bad wingman? That's a good tip. That's a good tip. That's a good tip.

583
01:51:49,579 --> 01:52:02,520
Okay. What else we got? All right. Get this stupid filter up. Investigate the room. But what else is

584
01:52:02,520 --> 01:52:10,420
there? The blood stains? Shoes. He was looking for those. Wait. Something hidden under here.

585
01:52:11,060 --> 01:52:26,220
Anything else in this bed? Telephone. Can anything be interacted with? Wait.

586
01:52:26,220 --> 01:52:41,399
We're at the computer again? Oh, there's a note here. Zachary's suicide note. It's a handwriting

587
01:52:41,399 --> 01:52:46,329
sample. Suicide note found on Zachary Carlisle's bedroom. It reads, I am haunted by horrible past

588
01:52:46,329 --> 01:52:51,369
choices and their all-consuming consequences. Alexa was the raft keeping me afloat. With that

589
01:52:51,369 --> 01:53:08,229
I cannot go on. Goodbye. Oh, we see if it's a forged signature. Okay. I get it. Forged signature.

590
01:53:08,229 --> 01:53:25,619
What else is in here? Does he have a pair of shoes in here? I don't see anything else to interact

591
01:53:25,619 --> 01:53:51,109
with. A climb? Wait. There's a lemon over here. That's a kitchen knife. Is he my trolling? No.

592
01:53:51,670 --> 01:54:07,399
What am I supposed to be looking for? Turn around. There's a big book over here. Bookshelf.

593
01:54:08,199 --> 01:54:17,350
Go to the bookshelf. Bookshelf next to the ladder. Oh, the ladder was like blocking this.

594
01:54:18,149 --> 01:54:30,810
It's a secret passage. This could explain how the door was locked from the inside.

595
01:54:30,810 --> 01:54:49,220
Peep? Oh, this is... Can somebody see my eyeball? Let's just stop pretending. Okay, we got another

596
01:54:49,220 --> 01:54:58,869
note. Floor plan. A photocopy of the floor plan. Floor plan of Thornbridge Manor detailing several

597
01:54:58,869 --> 01:55:03,369
hidden rooms and passages. One which connects to Zachary Carlisle's bedroom. Somebody's been

598
01:55:03,369 --> 01:55:08,649
researching the secret ins and outs of Thornbridge Manor. This is a two-way mirror. I believe you've

599
01:55:08,649 --> 01:55:14,970
done a thorough search of the crime scene 47. Maybe it's time to see the butler. I'm curious

600
01:55:14,970 --> 01:55:23,670
about the information he's prepared for you. Oh, close that. I want people to know I know what this

601
01:55:23,670 --> 01:55:40,630
is. Mystery switch. Save it. All right. You got info. This is cool. A little investigation.

602
01:55:41,189 --> 01:55:54,409
This is fun. All right. What do you got for me? I got some info for you. The signature was forged.

603
01:55:54,489 --> 01:56:00,300
Mr. Furnsby? Hello there, sir. I'm done. I'm seen. Did you establish a time of death? Zachary died

604
01:56:00,300 --> 01:56:07,140
around last night. Well, that means the staff were off duty and Carlisle and her security didn't arrive

605
01:56:07,140 --> 01:56:13,460
until this morning. Hidden passages, though. Madam's family and myself as the only persons here when

606
01:56:13,460 --> 01:56:22,659
he died. I don't have to bring you in? No, I do not have. Well, I was alone. Let's investigate that.

607
01:56:22,659 --> 01:56:27,210
Here's the material that I prepared for you. It's a list of the possible... No, I was... I don't have that

608
01:56:27,210 --> 01:56:34,010
out of my... I was in Zachary's bedroom murdering him with poison. Oh, don't... Oops, sorry.

609
01:56:38,470 --> 01:56:47,210
This is very useful information, 47. Okay, very useful. Who's this? Gregory Carlisle,

610
01:56:48,199 --> 01:56:52,279
the oldest child of Alexa Carlisle. Gregory is a suspect in the murder of Zachary Carlisle.

611
01:56:53,340 --> 01:56:59,399
Rebecca Carlisle, the youngest child of Alexa Carlisle. Rebecca is a suspect. Emma Carlisle,

612
01:57:00,260 --> 01:57:07,529
the wife of Gregory, Patrick, the son of Emma, and Mr. Fernsby. Butler at Thornbridge Manor,

613
01:57:07,529 --> 01:57:18,170
Mr. Fernsby is a suspect in the murder of Zachary Carlisle. Hmm, okay. Suspects. Hmm.

614
01:57:24,810 --> 01:57:40,380
Am I supposed to be killing the lady? This is cool. Wait, I hear somebody talking.

615
01:57:43,689 --> 01:57:50,619
Okay, there's the son. Let's do it.

616
01:58:18,979 --> 01:58:19,779
Okay, let's question him.

617
01:58:19,779 --> 01:58:30,020
Kill this guy. Where were you yesterday evening?

618
01:58:36,460 --> 01:58:36,779
Kill.

619
01:58:36,779 --> 01:58:38,779
Kill.

620
01:58:48,119 --> 01:58:49,000
Shit, I was trying to close all the doors.

621
01:58:54,359 --> 01:59:08,329
Okay. The library is... Sure, but what happened? What do you think about Zachary?

622
01:59:11,510 --> 01:59:15,350
Or do you think about shoes? Boots, specifically? Size 10.

623
01:59:30,090 --> 01:59:30,649
Just kill them all.

624
01:59:30,649 --> 01:59:41,430
Interesting.

625
01:59:45,750 --> 02:00:00,229
Just kill all the suspects. Kill all the suspects. That's how you get it? That's brute

626
02:00:00,229 --> 02:00:34,979
forcing. Patrick, it was me. Okay, bye. Who else is here? Targets. Am I allowed to go upstairs,

627
02:00:34,979 --> 02:00:53,800
right? Why are you dressed as a bad guy from, like, wait, Mr. X? It is kind of Mr. X, isn't it?

628
02:00:56,010 --> 02:01:02,710
Can I just go... Wait, hold on. Should I solve the mystery or should I just go in and shoot the lady

629
02:01:02,710 --> 02:01:23,800
and then leave? Where are they? Are they underneath me? Where are they? I can hear them talking

630
02:01:23,800 --> 02:01:35,720
through the wall. Solve it. Solve it. All right, I'll solve the puzzle. Let me see who actually did

631
02:01:35,720 --> 02:01:43,029
the killing and then we're gonna get them all in a room and I'm just gonna just throw axes at them.

632
02:01:43,029 --> 02:01:50,659
I don't know. You know what I do. You know how I do it. I'm the private... I'm the private

633
02:01:50,659 --> 02:02:03,699
investigator. I can't... I can't go up here? Why not? Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god.

634
02:02:03,699 --> 02:02:23,449
Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. No, no, no, no, no. Okay. Let me solve

635
02:02:23,449 --> 02:02:29,060
the mystery. I gotta find... Where are the other people? Where are... I've questioned you. Questioned

636
02:02:29,060 --> 02:02:35,590
you. You were, like, with a girl somewhere, right? All right, where are you? I'm looking for Emma.

637
02:02:35,590 --> 02:02:44,619
This is a big ass house.

638
02:02:57,180 --> 02:03:02,140
Where were both of you? Oh, wait, you're not... I thought you had kids.

639
02:03:02,699 --> 02:03:12,460
Somebody in the garden? Is that a brick? Holy shit. Best item in the game, thank god.

640
02:03:13,100 --> 02:03:27,640
I thought they were... I thought they were, like, the... I don't know. I thought they were the kids.

641
02:03:30,460 --> 02:03:46,649
Like, her kids? The people that could be killers? Give somebody... Give somebody a brick massage.

642
02:03:46,649 --> 02:04:00,119
What does that even mean? All right, I'm looking for more people to talk to.

643
02:04:00,119 --> 02:04:11,539
Somebody else in the garden? I have to investigate. I can't just have things given to me.

644
02:04:30,470 --> 02:04:30,970
Okay.

645
02:04:36,310 --> 02:04:58,409
Ohhhh, the butler! So the butler and Rebecca have half of a key. That's good to know,

646
02:04:58,409 --> 02:05:08,020
and that's how you get into the safe trophy room. Oo, hello there. Rebecca.

647
02:05:08,020 --> 02:05:12,800
I see. What's your story?

648
02:05:30,880 --> 02:05:31,380
Lye.

649
02:05:35,159 --> 02:05:36,119
Lye, how would you know that?

650
02:05:38,640 --> 02:05:40,640
He snuck away to hang out with a girl.

651
02:05:40,640 --> 02:05:41,600
Lye, how would you know that?

652
02:05:50,800 --> 02:05:51,300
Oh, nine?

653
02:05:51,300 --> 02:05:52,399
That's- we're Pacific time.

654
02:05:53,720 --> 02:05:55,039
10-12, did you talk to somebody at 12am?

655
02:05:56,920 --> 02:05:58,760
All those- all those offices are closed. Lye.

656
02:05:58,840 --> 02:06:01,529
She did act a bit strange.

657
02:06:01,930 --> 02:06:09,739
You know, I bet she was making lists for changes needing to be done once she gets her hands on Thornbridge Manor.

658
02:06:10,300 --> 02:06:13,670
Quite the shock she had when mother arrived during breakfast.

659
02:06:13,670 --> 02:06:14,430
That's a lie too.

660
02:06:15,789 --> 02:06:19,750
Tell me about Zachary. Did he act strange last night?

661
02:06:19,750 --> 02:06:23,430
You know, now you mention it. He was a lot more chatty than usual.

662
02:06:23,430 --> 02:06:23,930
Hmm.

663
02:06:24,229 --> 02:06:28,229
He wanted to know about my connections in the publishing business.

664
02:06:28,229 --> 02:06:28,729
Where'd you get these?

665
02:06:28,970 --> 02:06:32,170
Apparently, a friend of his is writing a book.

666
02:06:32,170 --> 02:06:33,170
Where'd you get those?

667
02:06:33,170 --> 02:06:36,170
Which strikes me as very peculiar. I didn't think he had any friends.

668
02:06:36,170 --> 02:06:37,569
Is that everything, Mr. Whitmer?

669
02:06:37,569 --> 02:06:38,569
Where'd you get those?

670
02:06:38,569 --> 02:06:39,569
I do have a lot to see to.

671
02:06:39,569 --> 02:06:42,899
Where'd you get them?

672
02:06:42,899 --> 02:06:44,899
Anything else you feel like mentioning?

673
02:06:44,899 --> 02:06:52,899
I may be wrong, but I saw Mr. Fernsby, the butler, leave Zachary's room early this afternoon.

674
02:06:52,899 --> 02:06:56,899
And he seemed a bit startled when he saw me in the hallway.

675
02:06:56,899 --> 02:06:58,899
It's probably nothing.

676
02:06:58,899 --> 02:06:59,899
Oh, and one more thing.

677
02:07:01,359 --> 02:07:05,539
Please be kind to Edward. He can only take so much.

678
02:07:05,539 --> 02:07:11,880
Keep your distance, sir.

679
02:07:11,880 --> 02:07:14,050
Okay. Thank you for the help.

680
02:07:14,050 --> 02:07:16,050
Now we know we need to talk to Edward.

681
02:07:16,050 --> 02:07:27,399
I'm probably just going to get fed up that I'm trying to talk to people that I need to find.

682
02:07:27,399 --> 02:07:29,399
And I'm going to not find one family member, and I'm just not going to care.

683
02:07:29,399 --> 02:07:31,399
I'm just going to go up and shoot her in the head.

684
02:07:31,399 --> 02:07:34,470
Ooh, a garden fork. Nice.

685
02:07:34,470 --> 02:07:45,670
Alright, somebody else down here.

686
02:07:45,670 --> 02:07:56,470
Revealing a mission?

687
02:07:56,470 --> 02:08:00,369
What?

688
02:08:01,210 --> 02:08:03,210
So, Madame Carlisle wants a picture taken.

689
02:08:03,210 --> 02:08:09,210
If you were to assist with this refuse, I'm sure the portrait would be one for the audience.

690
02:08:09,210 --> 02:08:11,710
Bring the whole family together?

691
02:08:11,710 --> 02:08:15,359
And just explode the camera?

692
02:08:15,359 --> 02:08:22,399
Oh, that's...

693
02:08:22,399 --> 02:08:25,149
Shit.

694
02:08:25,149 --> 02:08:28,479
Okay, hold on.

695
02:08:28,479 --> 02:08:30,479
But I'm supposed to be investigating a murder right now.

696
02:08:30,479 --> 02:08:35,979
Hold on. There's too many things to do.

697
02:08:35,979 --> 02:08:39,760
Who's in here?

698
02:08:39,760 --> 02:08:46,279
Solve the murder. I want to take a picture of people.

699
02:08:46,279 --> 02:08:51,020
Believing his sister was dead.

700
02:08:51,859 --> 02:08:55,859
I'd say worried about how things would be handled with Gregory and Emma taking over.

701
02:08:55,859 --> 02:08:57,859
I said they'd let him stay here.

702
02:08:57,859 --> 02:08:59,859
But Ethel was sure Emma would throw him out.

703
02:08:59,859 --> 02:09:01,859
First chance she got.

704
02:09:01,859 --> 02:09:03,859
And now we'll never know.

705
02:09:03,859 --> 02:09:05,859
You're taking this hard, aren't you?

706
02:09:05,859 --> 02:09:10,399
Okay.

707
02:09:10,399 --> 02:09:12,960
Solve the murder.

708
02:09:12,960 --> 02:09:14,960
I will solve the murder.

709
02:09:14,960 --> 02:09:20,789
I'm going to solve the murder.

710
02:09:20,789 --> 02:09:22,789
Can I at least kill the photographer?

711
02:09:22,789 --> 02:09:25,779
You guys...

712
02:09:25,779 --> 02:09:27,779
Holy shit.

713
02:09:32,439 --> 02:09:39,100
Alright, where's the map? I want to see where people are.

714
02:09:39,100 --> 02:09:42,109
I need...

715
02:09:42,109 --> 02:09:46,720
What's this? Area undiscovered.

716
02:09:46,720 --> 02:09:48,720
Alright, I'm going to go back in.

717
02:09:48,720 --> 02:09:50,960
I have two or three more people to talk to.

718
02:09:50,960 --> 02:09:54,520
Hey.

719
02:09:54,520 --> 02:09:57,020
What's going on, bro?

720
02:10:08,380 --> 02:10:12,159
I'm sure it is.

721
02:10:12,159 --> 02:10:17,210
I want to question some more.

722
02:10:17,210 --> 02:10:20,350
I questioned you.

723
02:10:20,350 --> 02:10:24,250
Did I go this way?

724
02:10:24,250 --> 02:10:25,720
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

725
02:10:56,489 --> 02:11:04,350
Awkward how do you have a meaningful conversation with a man who only cares about what's the strongest poison in my opinion your opinion?

726
02:11:07,529 --> 02:11:15,270
She supported his self-limiting behavior by letting him live here anything else you want have you noticed anything else out of the ordinary?

727
02:11:15,729 --> 02:11:17,729
Nothing special comes to mind

728
02:11:18,970 --> 02:11:24,170
Yes, I did get a feeling exactly was depressed not just sad I

729
02:11:25,149 --> 02:11:28,390
Suppose he realized that he had no one with Alexa gone

730
02:11:28,989 --> 02:11:34,350
Even Alexa must feel the pangs of guilt over that one letting him believe she was dead

731
02:11:35,350 --> 02:11:38,430
Then again guilt isn't her strong suit

732
02:11:39,840 --> 02:11:41,840
Okay

733
02:11:41,840 --> 02:11:45,800
Hmm. We'll go over this so we need there's a couple more people to question like you

734
02:11:46,399 --> 02:11:57,579
Come on if I sit can you tell me where you were yesterday evening? Oh, you're wondering about my

735
02:11:57,699 --> 02:12:02,359
Well

736
02:12:06,239 --> 02:12:08,239
He's like scratching his ass in his coach

737
02:12:27,180 --> 02:12:28,739
Why

738
02:12:28,739 --> 02:12:31,539
All here's the thing guys all of them did it

739
02:12:32,180 --> 02:12:36,819
They all walked in different times of the night and like stabbed him with a different knife

740
02:12:37,220 --> 02:12:45,449
One of them poisoned him one of them strangled him one of them like shot a dart into his neck

741
02:12:45,850 --> 02:12:51,909
One of them just shot him. They all did it. Tell me about Zachary

742
02:12:57,420 --> 02:13:03,140
One of them bricked him everybody gave him a really rough brick massage

743
02:13:19,409 --> 02:13:22,850
Obviously fucked up didn't she faking her own death

744
02:13:23,810 --> 02:13:29,029
She's explained nothing to us. I think she's scared to own up to her own mistake

745
02:13:31,130 --> 02:13:37,850
Okay, we have one more person to question we need to question

746
02:13:40,300 --> 02:13:53,039
Flanders Edward Carlisle the middle child of Alexa Edwards is suspect. I were you one more to question look at the wait

747
02:13:53,039 --> 02:14:08,659
Wait, hold on. What's that poison? Where is he? Well?

748
02:14:23,199 --> 02:14:31,140
Mm-hmm. I'd one more thing to ask one last question

749
02:14:40,729 --> 02:14:42,729
Alexa Jim the Lies

750
02:14:43,250 --> 02:15:21,090
Where's Flanders areas? Where were you?

751
02:15:21,890 --> 02:15:28,329

754
02:16:07,979 --> 02:16:26,789
Can you put get back to work, please that was beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful air

755
02:16:28,239 --> 02:16:33,750
That deserves at least two bricks

756
02:16:37,729 --> 02:16:43,090
What just happened serves him as a service of brick

757
02:16:44,409 --> 02:16:46,090
But he's not dead

758
02:16:46,090 --> 02:16:48,780
Wait, they just watch that

759
02:16:48,899 --> 02:16:58,010
Okay, I need to see if he gets up and plays the piano when he wakes up

760
02:16:58,010 --> 02:16:59,649
I'm gonna fucking shit my pants

761
02:16:59,649 --> 02:17:26,700
How long does it take to wake up is there a way to wake him up faster

762
02:17:26,700 --> 02:17:33,329
Like can I go over and like I mean I hit him in the face of the brick

763
02:17:33,329 --> 02:17:59,629
I don't think he's getting up for a long time. Don't do it. Just solve the murder. I'm working on it

764
02:17:59,629 --> 02:18:15,819
Oh, we have to just listen to this and drop a chandelier on him. I'm not gonna brick him

765
02:18:15,819 --> 02:18:22,809
I already did that and I'm not gonna ruin it. Holy shit. I got a great photo opportunity here

766
02:18:33,120 --> 02:18:41,040
You were just playing that's all it took you to stand up. I'm here

767
02:18:46,079 --> 02:18:48,079
Oh, yes

768
02:19:16,950 --> 02:19:18,950
Detective I have to take photos

769
02:19:21,280 --> 02:19:30,149
My mother's supposed dad, but he seemed more engaged than usual. Mm-hmm. You should ask Rebecca

770
02:19:30,149 --> 02:19:32,909
They had a long talk. I did talk to Rebecca already your last

771
02:19:42,030 --> 02:19:45,750
Interesting did you notice anything else out of the ordinary?

772
02:19:45,750 --> 02:19:49,590
I mean apart from the fact we came here to bury our mother as she shows up alive and kicking

773
02:19:49,950 --> 02:19:55,549
The Zachary found dead in his bed this morning or perhaps of the plant funeral is still taking place and I have to do the eulogy

774
02:20:00,750 --> 02:20:19,020
Okay, okay, what's going why are these blocked out wait have that did I clear these guys

I can't be my legs. My eyes are not okay

778
02:21:17,860 --> 02:21:19,860
You can't tell anyone, okay

779
02:21:26,159 --> 02:21:31,899
But even though mother is still alive we still have to go through with the funeral I have to write the eulogy I

Don't think I turn drive right the eulogy form

782

My legs are really weird. I can do it for you. I'll do it

02:25:09,350 --> 02:25:17,909
The night before and handwriting does not match Zachary's suicide note. We've cleared Rebecca. She's been pretty much cleared completely

799
02:25:18,549 --> 02:25:32,790
Although she's kind of a slob. Just we're just gonna leave that there. I think she is guilty of is major disorganizational skills

800

Alright, I think she's clear. I don't think there's anything else to look at wait what's behind the painting the dog? Oh

824
02:33:32,709 --> 02:33:56,840
I'm just kidding. All right, so don't do this mission. There's no reason to I have cleared

825
02:33:57,120 --> 02:34:11,260
So it's the it's one of these three people. It's the Emma Patrick or mr. Fernsby. What's that?

826
02:34:11,780 --> 02:34:19,420
Somebody's gonna crushed in there. So with this if we did Emma's room, let's go over here

There is a room over here this way Ryan straight ahead

828
02:34:34,649 --> 02:34:48,569
Whose room is down here? No, this is a new area. They're not

02:34:49,129 --> 02:34:57,459
Where's this little room on area undiscovered? What is it? Wait, is it behind this?

830
02:34:58,139 --> 02:35:24,629
What is over here? The first floor. It must be wall dad. Okay, what about down here staff room?

831
02:35:24,629 --> 02:35:32,579
All right. I didn't check anything on the other side. Let's do that. He's in here. Should I follow him around?

832
02:35:32,739 --> 02:35:57,120
Are these rooms upstairs? No, this is level zero. Here we go staff room. I was in

833
02:35:57,120 --> 02:36:16,129
The door to mr. Fernsby's office, how do I get in here? Wait, should I camera icons on the map? Oh shit

834
02:36:16,129 --> 02:36:20,670

866
02:41:03,190 --> 02:41:17,360
All right. I need to catch them doing something Emma. She's seen nothing out of the ordinary

867
02:41:18,280 --> 02:41:25,879
Except that Zachary prepared depressed and Mrs. Zachary's company was always awkward due to all this consuming fascination with plants plants

Piano the book on the piano. Oh, he's writing the thing

874
02:42:25,569 --> 02:42:30,209
And when you saw me you climbed a tree I was relieved that help had finally arrived

875
02:42:30,209 --> 02:42:36,440
But you went down immediately and said when a grown-up can do it. So can you Edward you?

886
02:43:45,639 --> 02:43:47,950

Mr. Fernsby's list a list written by mr. Fernsby the butler

991
03:05:00,000 --> 03:05:06,020
It details various preparations for tomorrow's pretend funeral and a photo shoot scheduled for today by the fountain in the garden

992
03:05:06,020 --> 03:05:08,450
The handwriting does not match

993
03:05:09,010 --> 03:05:13,459

Oh

1001
03:05:39,430 --> 03:05:47,809
But not the poison used to kill Zachary. Of course, madam Carlisle doesn't know

1002
03:05:48,329 --> 03:05:55,510
Okay, we're supposed to kill madam Carlisle. I feel like we should be frame the butler 47

1003
03:05:55,510 --> 03:05:59,100
I feel like we should just be clearly didn't commit the murder

1004
03:05:59,100 --> 03:06:04,860
You know, I mean like what you have enough evidence to convince madam Carlisle. He did we could do that

1005
03:06:04,860 --> 03:06:07,899
You should tell him you are ready to present your findings. Mmm

1006
03:06:08,379 --> 03:06:12,260
Unless of course you want to do some more detecting 47. Mmm

1007
03:06:13,520 --> 03:06:25,620
Frame the butler. I like that idea. Let's do it. Something else in here to look at throw away the saber shit

03:06:46,299 --> 03:06:48,299
Could put about the boat key. Um

03:06:54,739 --> 03:06:56,299
Yeah, I don't know

1012
03:06:56,299 --> 03:07:10,260
Doesn't matter. Is there a note somewhere I can take a picture of that like a handwritten note

1013
03:07:10,500 --> 03:07:25,909
There's two out of three clues in here. What's the other one? Oh, no, I got them all. It's just for achievements

1014
03:07:26,170 --> 03:07:35,709

03:14:33,000 --> 03:14:39,530
No, I'll go to the boat after this look

1030
03:14:39,530 --> 03:14:43,329
I'm just gonna throw a brick at her and snap his neck and then I'll go to the boat

1031
03:14:43,569 --> 03:14:49,780
I'll go to the boat. I got to do every single thing. It's hit man. It's not a collect every achievement, man

1032
03:14:50,020 --> 03:15:16,809

1033
03:15:17,170 --> 03:15:26,940
What I feel like doing I

1034
03:15:27,379 --> 03:15:32,120
Might decide to push him out the window. I might decide to throw a brick at him

1035
03:15:32,120 --> 03:15:36,180
I might decide to poison her and then punch him

1036
03:15:36,180 --> 03:15:39,100
I might decide to leave them both in the room and have them kill each other

1037
03:15:39,420 --> 03:15:47,409
Please step inside. I might just brick him right now. You just pointed the wrong way

1130
03:34:29,569 --> 03:34:31,750
You think I would betray 47

1131
03:34:32,389 --> 03:34:34,629

Very dangerous why what?

1413
04:16:41,719 --> 04:16:44,219
I can probably mess with it up there

1414
04:16:44,549 --> 04:16:47,030
I bump light show and then trigger climax, right?

1415
04:16:50,469 --> 04:16:54,090

04:18:12,809 --> 04:18:15,879
Let's do it at the right time

1432
04:18:20,120 --> 04:18:31,700

04:20:12,809 --> 04:20:22,010
I didn't want to do that. I tried to press a different button. Oh, fuck me. All right. I'm trying to drop down

1441
04:20:31,270 --> 04:20:34,469

04:22:53,909 --> 04:22:56,790
I gotta I have to kill them. I gotta kill this guy right now

1462
04:22:57,430 --> 04:23:06,579
Will he see me?

1463
04:23:06,579 --> 04:23:21,930
Who?

1464
04:23:21,930 --> 04:23:32,139

They're coming for you

1467
04:23:48,680 --> 04:24:00,360
I'm thinking about just honestly shooting this guy in the head right now. This guy always seems to be in the worst possible place

1468
04:24:00,920 --> 04:24:03,639
I'm just gonna shoot him. Who cares? Just shoot the guy in the face

1469
04:24:04,200 --> 04:24:29,819
Does it really matter? I'm just gonna dump his ass. Is he coming this way? I might need that. All right, save it here

1470
04:24:29,979 --> 04:24:46,860
There's an agent, right?

1471
04:24:46,860 --> 04:24:48,860
No, what the fuck these people here?

1472
04:24:58,180 --> 04:25:18,579
Push joke again. Sure. Okay. Here we go. I have to distract these people somehow and he's an agent so

1473
04:25:19,139 --> 04:25:26,760
Technician knows okay

1474
04:25:26,760 --> 04:25:32,120
Check the volt regulator before the dj goes on tonight

1475
04:25:32,120 --> 04:25:36,200
If it's broken or overloaded the light showed rigged on the tree trunk might blow up when the d. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

1476
04:25:36,440 --> 04:25:52,680
Okay, that's what this this is. Okay. How do I get you guys to leave run off high voltage power outlet?

1477
04:25:52,680 --> 04:26:03,670
I could turn this off. I gotta get rid of the I don't make coins like a soda can

1478
04:26:08,520 --> 04:26:09,959
uh

1479
04:26:09,959 --> 04:26:28,180
One of them walks away for a second. Let me see what happens if I turn this off turn these

1480
04:26:28,579 --> 04:26:56,100
Turn the fuse box off. Okay. There we go. Investigate that. I'm checking out. I couldn't walk over there

1481
04:26:56,500 --> 04:27:44,379
All right. Can I get them? Okay. What if I do this short circuit the tree turn it on? Okay

1482
04:27:44,459 --> 04:27:51,209
So now this is like super powered now do the dj climax

1483
04:27:52,010 --> 04:27:58,739
Explore expose the wire put the fuse back put the fuse back together

1484
04:28:06,790 --> 04:28:09,100
Fuse box the other switch

1485
04:28:09,659 --> 04:28:16,149
They're all off. All right, turn it on. Wait one. No the fuse box. What?

1486
04:28:19,799 --> 04:28:21,799
Why do I have to kill both of these people?

1487
04:28:30,280 --> 04:28:41,059
Oh fuck

04:28:41,139 --> 04:28:48,260
Oh shit, you know what fuck you who cares?

1489
04:28:48,899 --> 04:29:08,840
That was the target

1490
04:29:08,840 --> 04:29:10,840
All that setup was so pointless

1491
04:29:11,530 --> 04:29:13,610
They got like 10 wires on the ground. I can't

1492
04:29:14,250 --> 04:29:22,100
Give me that earpiece

1493
04:29:22,100 --> 04:29:24,100
All the setup to just wait. I need the dj outfit

1494
04:29:52,250 --> 04:29:54,809
Okay, so let me get this straight

1495
04:29:54,969 --> 04:30:01,860
Short circuit the light installation unplug the wire fuse box turn off the voltage

1496
04:30:02,100 --> 04:30:04,100
What what's what's button do I have to press here?

1497
04:30:11,719 --> 04:30:16,469
How stoned are you?

1498
04:30:16,469 --> 04:30:20,389
The outlet was literally wait am I supposed to what is he supposed to step on this?

1499
04:30:22,360 --> 04:30:26,709
Only short-circuited

1500
04:30:26,709 --> 04:30:30,500
Just shoot him

1501
04:30:30,500 --> 04:30:32,500
Just overload it and shoot him

1502
04:30:37,639 --> 04:31:11,239
Okay, here's the plan come over here. I want this outfit. This is not oceans 11

04:31:16,200 --> 04:31:18,200
It's oceans 11

1504
04:31:18,649 --> 04:31:22,569
Okay. Now i'm allowed to short circuit this so the wire so expose the wire

1505
04:31:27,459 --> 04:31:33,290
Right and then short-circuited

1506
04:31:33,370 --> 04:31:37,209
What am I actually supposed to be doing i'm not even kidding what am I what am I supposed to be doing here

Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait

1514

1515
04:32:15,750 --> 04:32:18,579
No

1516
04:32:18,579 --> 04:32:23,260
Oh, I thought he was supposed to walk over like the exposed wire

1517
04:32:25,819 --> 04:32:27,819
Oh, okay. Well

1518
04:32:27,899 --> 04:32:31,590

04:39:45,049 --> 04:39:46,729
I think it's been pretty fun

1586
04:39:46,729 --> 04:39:49,450
Except for this level. I don't like this level at all

1587
04:39:52,250 --> 04:39:54,779
I don't like it

1588
04:39:54,779 --> 04:39:58,419
But i'm gonna continue playing it

04:41:36,889 --> 04:41:40,439
I just hate fucking cement if you have cement levels in your game delete them

1611
04:41:40,919 --> 04:41:45,049
Everybody hates them including me. I hate it. I hate when everything's a cement level
