00:00:03,259 --> 00:00:13,109
Meet me in the park. Hold on. I can't meet you in the park yet. Oh my god. You're about to crash the game, aren't you?

00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:28,600
Falling me down

00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:56,409
I don't think this is not gonna even fit on the track. You do realize this right? It will

00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:06,659

00:01:37,769 --> 00:01:41,849
This thing's been here. It's only one of the first wooden coasters in the world

I can't believe this is actually working seriously ready for the super drop. Oh, here's the big drop

Why is someone screaming I don't know I bet I really don't think you can get me though
