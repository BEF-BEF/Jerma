00:00:19,339 --> 00:00:25,199
Ripped here. It's so tight. What's going on? And I was like, this doesn't feel right on me. It was Kim's underwear

5
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:30,250
I just ruined them. I just I just put them on it. I was like, this doesn't feel right. This is weird

6
00:00:30,609 --> 00:00:44,039

I'm sorry that God decided that I was gonna have that for a hair. I'm so what do you want to say?

29
00:03:39,509 --> 00:03:42,580
We want to apologize

30
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:55,930
Tomorrow I can't even fix it. It refuses to not be a mustache. I'm just I'm buzzeted. I'm buzzing it

31
00:03:56,449 --> 00:04:04,159
It has to be wet for it to not be mustache hair. I asked me anything. Let's go. Let's do it

32
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:06,080
Ask me they'll even in the right category

33
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:18,370
No, all right. Let's go

34
00:04:24,649 --> 00:04:26,649
It's your favorite color teal

35
00:04:26,689 --> 00:04:29,180
teal a

36
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:31,180
large is your

37
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:34,939
Index finger, I don't know

38
00:04:34,939 --> 00:04:40,670
Two and a half inches when you play super monkey ball very soon on the Nintendo GameCube

39
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:54,509
When you're gonna get sponsored by Chuck E Cheese, it's not gonna happen. You'd like their establishment though. What's my ones that I can answer, please?

40
00:04:55,149 --> 00:05:08,959
Are you gonna play metal gear? Uh, maybe that's the last time you peed your pants an hour ago

41
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:13,240
When are you gonna do birdwatching?

42
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:26,879
That's a good question. I have no idea. I have absolutely no idea. I want to do the birdwatching stream, but I want it to be

43
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:31,220
Good. All right. Here's my fear about the birdwatching stream

44
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:35,139
I'm out there and I got binoculars and you guys got binoculars. You guys have your own binoculars for chat

45
00:05:35,579 --> 00:05:39,029
So you can see too, you know, so I can like put you in the right spot

46
00:05:39,029 --> 00:05:44,269
I want there to be a camera that's binoculars in the camera so I can when I look at it

47
00:05:44,269 --> 00:05:49,449
You'll see it too. But the problem with that is what if no birds show up?

48
00:05:49,769 --> 00:05:52,930
And it's just me sitting it under like a tree

49
00:05:53,470 --> 00:06:02,120
Like four or five hours. Did I grow a unibrow? No, I think it's just the

50
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:09,180
Thanks. Just did I I try I usually Kim gets in there and she and she plucks it for me

51
00:06:09,699 --> 00:06:21,329
Is it there doesn't look like it? Maybe it's like the bitrate. It's been a while though

52
00:06:21,769 --> 00:06:29,269
No, it feels pretty bare in there. Maybe like right here. It's a little thick

53
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:31,750
It could use it. It could use a little cleaning

54
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:34,910
You're a mess

55
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:50,329
Am I actually that there's a car? Okay. Hold on. Here's the thing if when I go like this, am I?

56
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:54,029
One or two frames in there make it look like shit

57
00:06:54,470 --> 00:07:02,560
That's the thing you could pull even if I look at you like this and I'm talking like very normally and I look fairly

58
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,560
normal one of these

59
00:07:05,079 --> 00:07:08,120
Frames is gonna look wicked

60
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:17,069
And which one is it? I don't know. Did somebody do it? Let's let's do I want to I want to do this theory

61
00:07:17,629 --> 00:07:23,810
Okay, I'm gonna say a sentence and I want somebody to just take a screenshot of me in the middle of talking and I guarantee

62
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:28,029
You my eyes are going this way. My nose is like going like this. My mouth is like this

63
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:33,819

I hope you're joining us for some cool adventures and some great video gaming join us today

65
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:50,259
Good, let's see it right now. Somebody get it. I want I want you to pull one just any frame from there

66
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:20,529
I can't click that I can't I'm not showing that I'm not showing that I'm not gonna show it not showing it

67
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:44,629
Why did you make this okay this somebody's got one

68
00:08:47,129 --> 00:08:58,379
I'm not I'm not showing that it's okay. Look it look at how fucked up I look

69
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:01,460
This is just a random frame

70
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:04,860
Let's see

71
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:11,490
I want to see if I can match how I look in these weird screenshots that you take in the middle of me talking

72
00:09:12,049 --> 00:09:19,730
Doesn't like something looks strange. Something looks off

73
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:34,330
Normal my eyes look too big

74
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:43,240
All of a sudden the one on the right just goes man just jumps at the screen. Oh, that'd be awesome

75
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:58,330
It's the real one. Yeah, perfect. So I've here we go. I need to show you guys this because this is so important

76
00:09:58,809 --> 00:10:01,049
when people

77
00:10:01,049 --> 00:10:04,710
Show a funny picture that I did look at how funny and weird he looks

78
00:10:05,389 --> 00:10:08,149
Look at this like crazy streamer. He's crazed

79
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:17,250
No, I think you just take a frame from in the middle of a normal sentence and I look I look insane

80
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:30,820
Gray hair. I don't have gray. It's the light above there. I'm cheese to meet you. No, I don't

81
00:10:31,379 --> 00:10:50,059
Yeah, here's another one. This one's the worst. This is awful this guy. I used to do this

82
00:10:50,059 --> 00:10:52,059
I used to do this shit for a living

83
00:10:52,299 --> 00:11:00,659
This is every single photo of people at the wedding that are not the bride or the groom that are in focus

84
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:03,620
This is every single other image

85
00:11:04,139 --> 00:11:17,580
Whoever is not directly in focus. You're this guy and you might just be eating he made money from this

86
00:11:18,299 --> 00:11:21,600
Yes, I did. I did I did wedding shit

87
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:27,779
Because that was the job that I could do I knew how to edit I knew how to film

88
00:11:27,779 --> 00:11:35,549
I I knew how to do these things. So I what can I do? I'm gonna make some cash. That's not new lore

89
00:11:35,549 --> 00:11:37,549
I've yes, that's been known since like

90
00:11:37,909 --> 00:11:38,950
2012

91
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:49,850
Chuck left. It's okay. I feel like this is not real

92
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:59,919
Is okay. Here's that let's play a game. Is this a real image or not? I don't think this one is I do not believe

93
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:06,639
This is a real screenshot from the string. No, it's not you can tell look at the nose

94
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:13,600
It's not real because look at the nose and look yeah, this is that this is not real. Sorry and incorrect

95
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:36,149
Rotate not real you can tell by the tip of the nose and you can tell by the eyes

96
00:12:36,669 --> 00:12:40,730
Not a real image. My eyes are too. The eyes are too close together in this one

97
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:47,000
Hey

98
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:58,539
Incorrect. I'm going up next on is this a real screenshot from the stream? This one is okay

99
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,559
I'm gonna my vote on this one is is yes

100
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:08,610
This is a yes from me. I think I think I believe this is probably a real image

101
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:19,759
Maybe not. Yeah, it's really look at you. See that. He's a space here

102
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:33,309
Okay, they were smart enough if they doctored it to put that in your dinosaur. I don't know though

103
00:13:33,309 --> 00:13:35,309
This looks a little fat down here

104
00:13:35,549 --> 00:13:37,549
like right here this looks I

105
00:13:38,789 --> 00:13:49,080
I don't know. I don't think that's real. Maybe it's not I'm gonna vote real though. I feel like this is real

106
00:13:49,519 --> 00:14:06,159
It's real. Okay, got it. Nice Raptor tooth. Hey. Hey, let's see your teeth. This one's also real

107
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:27,100
Let's see, it's also real. Yeah, that's a real image. What else we got?

108
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:32,340
Let's see this one this one. I I you know, I'm not I'm actually not sure about this one

109
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:34,940
Is this one day is this one a real image or not? Let's see. I wonder um

110
00:14:35,899 --> 00:14:42,879
well

111
00:14:42,879 --> 00:14:49,980
Mmm, it's hard to tell cuz like down here is the way that it seems pretty similar

112
00:14:50,620 --> 00:15:00,809
Yeah, it's real. I think this one's probably real pretty close

113
00:15:01,429 --> 00:15:03,230
This one's tough though. I don't know

114
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:13,649
The left one's the fake one I know this is real

115
00:15:15,009 --> 00:15:17,009
You know how I know this is real I

116
00:15:17,049 --> 00:15:23,720
Can tell you immediately because this is the exact face that I make in that germ of log thumbnail

117
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:30,429
Where I'm going like that. It's the same exact face. Somebody want to get it because it's we can verify the image

118
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:34,919
It's like handwriting like the way that your mouth moves when you talk is

119
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:43,769
Your handwriting that you it's handwriting like you can be identified. That's not a that's not a soy

120
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:46,509
Face, okay, that's me talking

121
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:54,539
So when I just said the a in talking talking go ahead ready when I say the a and talking

122
00:15:55,059 --> 00:16:01,269
Talking sure. Let's see what it looks like show it to me. Let's see

123
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:26,230
Nice gnome. You got me. That's not even close dude. All right, it's it might it needs a little work right here

124
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:41,419
But I'm working on it. Where's the one to be talking? It's not this one. All right. I'm not I can't I don't want to show this on

125
00:16:42,779 --> 00:17:07,380
It's this one. Give me the real one, please

126
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:29,539
People that are coming in and they said somebody just said this is so stupid

127
00:17:29,539 --> 00:17:33,660
Why can't we to watch the VOD you have no idea what happened during the stream?

128
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:36,940
Could you like if you explain this to somebody would do you think they would even believe you? I

129
00:17:37,819 --> 00:17:54,049
Don't I don't think I would believe somebody if they said this that's not even me. You're not even linking me pictures of me

130
00:17:56,539 --> 00:18:01,460
I'm gonna get this off my computer

131
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:04,500
I gotta get this image off my fucking computer and off my hard drive

132
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:11,460
And then I have to fucking then I have to get a new hard drive, okay

133
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:22,539
Where is this picture? What's wrong with this one? Wasn't on fucking purpose. I swear to God. I swear to God. I swear to God

134
00:18:26,609 --> 00:18:31,470
Why are you doing this?

135
00:18:32,109 --> 00:18:54,789
What file is it? This is real, of course

136
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:59,210
I'm still being hosted

137
00:19:00,089 --> 00:19:02,549
Shit. Oh

138
00:19:02,549 --> 00:19:05,470
No, no, no, we have to abort immediately

139
00:19:06,029 --> 00:19:13,000
This is an immediate this is an immediate abort scenario if I'm being hosted still

140
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:36,019
Okay, this one's like funny, but this is not even this is not even the same stream. This is a different stream

141
00:19:36,339 --> 00:19:46,869
This is a different. This is a different place

142
00:19:47,450 --> 00:20:04,529
Is this a pog? No, this is not a pog. I know there's noise coming off of this though

143
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:09,059
You want to know the noise coming off of this? This is the sound that this is making

144
00:20:09,059 --> 00:20:13,930
Oh

145
00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:33,779
That's what that emotion is that's not going like like oh no, no, that's very very energetic

146
00:20:34,299 --> 00:20:56,960
Kind of energy behind it. All right, what else you got? This is too big. Oh Chuck E Cheese is offline

147
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:07,759
That's just a before-and-after photo

148
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:13,819
Alright, that's just that's one of those like this is what happens when you do drugs for a long time

149
00:21:14,299 --> 00:21:23,460
The only thing it's missing is it's missing like four or five other pictures

150
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:44,460
That end up here. Maybe you shouldn't watch this stream. What else you got? I will add any more questions. Anybody got any questions?

151
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:48,279
Anybody have anything any questions to ask? Oh

152
00:21:50,339 --> 00:21:53,720
This is okay. There's a shitload of people here. Let's talk about this is actually really important stuff

153
00:21:54,789 --> 00:21:56,789
September 13th at

154
00:21:57,509 --> 00:21:59,309
3 p.m. Pacific is

155
00:21:59,309 --> 00:22:04,849
FTK that's what's coming back. You only need to be subscribed to the channel

156
00:22:04,849 --> 00:22:08,970
No, no more of that two three month active bullshit. It's just not gonna work

157
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:12,930
I wasn't around for like months so I cannot expect people to sub through my absence

158
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:19,910
So September 13th put it on your calendar at 3 p.m. Pacific. Why is it happening so much later now?

159
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:30,559
I'm noticing the unibrow now. I'm noticing it. I see what you mean, but it's not there

160
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:35,500
It's really not there though. It's like something to do with how this shadow is gone

161
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:40,259
What the fuck happened

162
00:22:40,619 --> 00:22:45,829
Okay cheese did something what happened we're talking about

163
00:22:46,569 --> 00:22:50,049
Lucky cheese. No FTK FTK. You got it. Got it. Got it. Yeah

164
00:22:50,569 --> 00:22:57,109
Alright, so it's not gonna be what you expect this time. It's gonna be a lot different. It's gonna be a

165
00:22:58,130 --> 00:23:03,009
100% reimagined game. It's not gonna be just shoot arrows at him until he fucking gets drunk and

166
00:23:03,529 --> 00:23:04,569
swears

167
00:23:04,569 --> 00:23:07,960
No, he's blitzed

168
00:23:08,079 --> 00:23:17,130
I'm not

169
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:25,420
100 of what what shoes I what shoes size do you wear 10 and

170
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:33,059
I bought seven and a half sandals and I just squeezed into him and it's and Kim laughs. Oh Kim laughed at something

171
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:38,599
Listen to this. I can't show this image, but it was fucking funny. She took a picture with her phone with my phone

172
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:41,460
So I was in the bathroom for a really long time yesterday

173
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:46,039
And I was just hanging out in there just like I was on the phone and like after you go

174
00:23:46,039 --> 00:23:50,509
I don't know. I do this all the time like after I'm done using the bathroom

175
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:56,910
I just hang out in there even when I'm done like clean. We're talking clean and done completely

176
00:23:56,910 --> 00:24:00,319
I just I'm just be I'm in here

177
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:05,980
I'm on the phone still like another maybe at least five to ten minutes. Sometimes a little bit more sometimes less

178
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:09,059
so I get out of the bathroom, I've been in there for about 30 minutes and

179
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:14,339
Kim is laughing her ass off at me. She's just cracking up. I'm like, what is so funny. What are you doing?

180
00:24:14,339 --> 00:24:16,700
And she just she was dying laughing. I could not get it out of her

181
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:21,940
I'm just like what why are you laughing and she's like just wait, wait, wait, and she took her

182
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:26,339
She's like, please turn around and she took a photo. By the way, I'm just I'm in my underwear, right?

183
00:24:26,539 --> 00:24:28,539
she took a photo and

184
00:24:28,819 --> 00:24:35,690
The photo is of my backside. There is a toilet seat. That is a perfect toilet seat

185
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:40,109
Line red under my like on my legs

186
00:24:40,589 --> 00:24:52,700
It's a big perfect toilet seat that's indented into my legs and I was really it was fucked

187
00:24:52,700 --> 00:25:01,539
It was so stupid. It was funny though. That's why my back is fucked up

188
00:25:02,019 --> 00:25:03,539
No, it's not

189
00:25:03,539 --> 00:25:07,309
It has a toilet scar

190
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:16,200
Okay, you know how people when they play games a lot they get this like the little redness here with the mouse on the keyboard

191
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:22,339
I guarantee you I have a red ass. I guarantee it. I guarantee it

192
00:25:22,339 --> 00:25:28,269
I have like an indented like inflamed red like ass and legs because the toilet seat

193
00:25:28,269 --> 00:25:32,789
I have like the the gamer sore here

194
00:25:32,789 --> 00:25:43,799
Whatever it's called on my ass because I spend a lot of time on the toilet like that. Prove it. Hey

195
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:49,839
Just gonna have to take my word for it. I get this off the fucking screen

196
00:25:49,839 --> 00:26:04,539
I don't want you to see the shelf because it was spoilers from the cam off

197
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:08,299
But when this cam turns off the streams turning off this this got destroyed

198
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:12,269
Started off playing a game Chuck E Cheese became my new best friend

199
00:26:13,579 --> 00:26:16,900
This has been weird, but I'm cool. It's fun

200
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:29,069
Draw it, but he hates you now. You missed a Chuck E Cheese comment

201
00:27:05,059 --> 00:27:09,759
Okay

202
00:27:09,759 --> 00:27:18,019
Anybody have any more questions, but no, I know FTK FTK shit. All right FTK. So FTK

203
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:24,670
Back the last time we did it, which is like four months ago. Now. This is gonna be completely different. It was

204
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:32,269
Kind of haphazardly organized. It wasn't a good set up. The servers got hammered this time this time

205
00:27:33,109 --> 00:27:35,990
It's gonna be completely different. We're gonna have like a ton

206
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:39,069
There's gonna be like seven or eight servers linked together to make this happen

207
00:27:39,549 --> 00:27:45,660
It's gonna be people you don't have to be subbed for more than two or three months. Just active subscription. That's it

208
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:51,220
There's gonna be a period about a three or four days before the stream happens

209
00:27:51,539 --> 00:27:56,500
Well, we're gonna start to try to bring in like white list people and get them white listed

210
00:27:56,500 --> 00:28:00,259
So we don't have the server get dumped with thousands of connections at the exact same time

211
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:07,650
This is what German plans when he's on the toilet. Yeah, no it is. You're right. This is you have that exactly, right?

212
00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:10,250
Explain FTK

213
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:15,089
Well, it was called fuck the king and the goal was I was gonna get as many people as I possibly could again

214
00:28:15,089 --> 00:28:18,309
Do a minecraft server with the goal is just whoever could just try to kill me

215
00:28:18,309 --> 00:28:21,170
I had god armor on and they were all children

216
00:28:21,170 --> 00:28:25,009
They were all babies and they would they would have tried to kill me like three or four hundred of them

217
00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:27,450
But then it did that didn't happen

218
00:28:27,569 --> 00:28:29,569
I don't have dying like three times

219
00:28:30,690 --> 00:28:32,690
the server went down like ten times and

220
00:28:33,869 --> 00:28:36,910
Um, that's all I remember I

221
00:28:37,589 --> 00:28:43,230
Remember walking around singing and there's like just 60 people standing around me and just looking at me

222
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:51,740
It's changed. This is a full three to five hour experience. It's it's a full game. This is a game

223
00:28:52,099 --> 00:28:54,259
This is not just like a okay. We're in

224
00:28:55,539 --> 00:29:04,440
Fucking just walk over there and just try to catch him. I guess no, there's a full game. It's September 13th at 3 p.m

225
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:10,519
Pacific the server is also gonna stay up by the way

226
00:29:10,519 --> 00:29:14,579
So when this is all done the server stays up for at least a month

227
00:29:15,059 --> 00:29:23,869
So people can play it that didn't get to play in the server. That's really important. I will I will crush it

228
00:29:24,349 --> 00:29:27,460
Please don't

229
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:30,809
Arm of death is back, but it's changed a little bit

230
00:29:30,809 --> 00:29:35,930
You don't get banned from the server you get kicked back to one of these hub cities that they're gonna have

231
00:29:36,089 --> 00:29:38,970
They're gonna have multiple servers that I have gonna have just be hub

232
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:41,910
Places for you to requeue to get back into the game

233
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:44,529
So you're not banned but you drop to the back of the queue

234
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:49,039
We want to try to cycle in as many people as possible and no gosh darn it

235
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:54,269
Let me tell you there's gonna be quite a few people being cycled out this y'all ain't gonna live

236
00:29:54,269 --> 00:29:57,950
I can I just I can assure you that so like those you that are like, yeah

237
00:29:57,950 --> 00:30:11,059
I'm gonna fucking live the whole time. I hope so. Good luck. Good luck. Make the germa is tiny sign again

238
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:18,920
I just like that person in the back of the queue. You're going to germa hell

239
00:30:19,119 --> 00:30:21,119
It is kind of like a purgatory thing

240
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:26,279
Because you don't get booted out of the client or anything or out of the server you go back to one of the other

241
00:30:27,119 --> 00:30:33,480
Queue servers. So how do you get in the queue? You just connect you just connect and

242
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:36,279
Then you get to you're gonna be able to you're gonna do a little thing

243
00:30:36,279 --> 00:30:43,019
There's gonna be a slash like authenticate thing where it just checks to see if you're a sub and apparently it works very very well

244
00:30:43,539 --> 00:30:45,059
They've been testing it for a little while

245
00:30:45,059 --> 00:30:51,710
All it does is just is this person's subs to germa 985 actively right now. The answer is yes

246
00:30:51,910 --> 00:30:55,549
And you can go in if the answer is no if hey, hold on if the answer is no

247
00:30:56,190 --> 00:30:59,319
You still hang out this hub server. You that's shut

248
00:30:59,799 --> 00:31:04,880
Speaking is difficult when you do it for a long time in a row. That's been about four hours of speaking in a row

249
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:13,009
And you'll die. No, you can hang out in the hub city. You don't you can be in the hub cities

250
00:31:13,769 --> 00:31:16,369
You just can't join the FTK game

251
00:31:16,930 --> 00:31:22,599
There are hub worlds people computer play can queue to play

252
00:31:22,599 --> 00:31:27,200
I actually don't know exactly how the hub world like the queue world is going to work

253
00:31:27,599 --> 00:31:31,279
but I'll obviously over the next three or four days, I'll get some more details on it and

254
00:31:32,789 --> 00:31:35,549
Like not even like three or four days before the stream happens

255
00:31:35,549 --> 00:31:37,230
There's gonna be a lot of testing on this as well

256
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:41,670
And I'll be in the discord asking all kinds of questions for people if they want to try to jump in and help

257
00:31:41,990 --> 00:31:44,109
So that's a curse length where?

258
00:31:44,710 --> 00:32:04,759
I thought that was real. I was like, holy shit. When did I show that much like underwear on stream?

259
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:08,720
I've never shown underwear like that on stream. I

260
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:13,089
Did ruin a pair of capes underwear though

261
00:32:13,089 --> 00:32:17,210
I just put them on cuz I was freaking out and they just didn't fit right and I just ripped the room

262
00:32:17,890 --> 00:32:24,309
Yeah, I didn't mean to wear them. I was I have black underwear. She has black underwear

263
00:32:24,589 --> 00:32:27,109
This is a really fucking hard thing to explain

264
00:32:27,109 --> 00:32:31,490
This is a really weird thing to be hosted by a family restaurant that serves pizza and as arcade games

265
00:32:32,069 --> 00:32:38,410
I'm talking about tearing through my girls like friends underwear. Why do I put it on?

266
00:32:38,849 --> 00:32:44,700
I'm not sure like anybody should be here right now, you know

267
00:32:44,819 --> 00:32:47,700
Do you think that I don't think anyone should be watching this

268
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:51,160
We're gonna put like a family restaurant

269
00:32:51,960 --> 00:33:02,640
Do a podcast. What do you want me to talk about? I'll do it right now

270
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:18,740
Give me a talk. Give me a topic and I'll talk about it runescape pretty cool. You can hey, how about that latest runescape update?

271
00:33:19,259 --> 00:33:29,720
2.4 point to talk about the stock market. No, we don't talk about the stock market anymore

272
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:36,390
Thought after Beyond Meat, I don't talk about the stock market anymore since Beyond Meat

273
00:33:36,869 --> 00:33:47,920
I got burned on Beyond Meat real bad. Yeah. Yeah, I was like, there's no way this is like a fucking $300 a share company

274
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:51,319
This is like more the way this was like more than Apple. I was like this is coming fucking way down

275
00:33:51,799 --> 00:33:54,119
Like there's no way this is it's a fucking it's I did look they're good

276
00:33:54,119 --> 00:33:57,920
I like them, but it's like as expensive as like Apple

277
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:03,599
I was like this no way you win some you fucking lose some you lose most of them

278
00:34:03,599 --> 00:34:06,160
You lose almost all of them. You lose almost all except for maybe one

279
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,320
while doing that, okay, so

280
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:14,809
How much did you lose? Not enough to be upset about

281
00:34:15,449 --> 00:34:20,889
enough to be irritated

282
00:34:21,849 --> 00:34:29,679
What modulator voice modulation do I use well, it is a go XLR and it actually works pretty well

283
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:34,599
It seems to be very cool. It's pretty easy to use

284
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:42,340
Is you just plug in your mic I'll get into your computer and it's a compressor it does everything for you

285
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:47,059
I don't want to have a a compressor a noise gate a

286
00:34:47,619 --> 00:34:50,840
End up like it's like an airplane up here. It's really really easy

287
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:55,420
Is that an ad no, I don't do but it works

288
00:34:55,980 --> 00:35:04,019
What am I gonna be a VTuber? I'm not a VTuber. There's somebody else that might become a VTuber eventually, but I'm not them

289
00:35:04,659 --> 00:35:14,610
Yeah, give me the image. When's the rumble the rumble is gonna be we're gonna be 2020

290
00:35:15,429 --> 00:35:17,429
rumble will be on

291
00:35:17,829 --> 00:35:25,969
January 1st, but December 31st. I'm gonna count down again like we did last time and in between

292
00:35:26,969 --> 00:35:31,010
Matches at the rumble. We're gonna do a few categories for the worst and best of the year

293
00:35:31,449 --> 00:35:35,719
I'm gonna do kind of a combo stream on New Year's Eve this year. That's right

294
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:39,460
combo German rumble Awards stream

295
00:35:40,869 --> 00:35:45,679
countdown New Year and I figured we could do it like that because as

296
00:35:46,159 --> 00:35:49,159
You all know I kind of disappeared for like two and a half months

297
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:54,760
So almost a full quarter of the year was kind of removed from this channel

298
00:35:55,320 --> 00:36:06,090
So, I think we're gonna just kind of put it into the rumble I mean we're gonna do halo reach stream part two

299
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:14,070
I'm not ever doing that again. Make the nominees fight for the award

300
00:36:15,130 --> 00:36:27,530
That's gonna happen at least once that will happen. I promise it'll happen at least one time at least once is

301
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:36,769
What that's gonna be a long stream? No, I don't think it will

302
00:36:37,289 --> 00:36:41,590
Just think about it. All the rumble streams are all less than three hours long

303
00:36:42,269 --> 00:36:47,630
It's just we watch it we do it I make it and we enjoy it and that's it and it's like two to four hours

304
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:49,630
It's not usually more than three hours

305
00:36:49,869 --> 00:36:55,449
So you put some categories in there you have like 10 15 plus categories being add another hour or two to the stream

306
00:36:55,449 --> 00:36:57,449
It's a four or five six hour stream. It's perfect

307
00:37:07,769 --> 00:37:13,469
Okay, if you go to Chuck E Cheese, I think they give you one of these so this doesn't mean anything to me

308
00:37:16,889 --> 00:37:19,070
You can actually get one of these

309
00:37:19,309 --> 00:37:29,500
And I mean like that this is not that this photo I mean, that's really great

310
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:35,579
But this I feel like this is he writes BFF on every single selfie that people take with them

311
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:38,659
How do I know that I'm special? How do I know I'm his real BFF?

312
00:37:38,659 --> 00:37:48,860
How's that? How am I supposed to know that he probably writes that on all of them, but if you turn it over

313
00:37:49,619 --> 00:38:01,449
There's a note on it. You don't do that for everybody. See what it says on the back

314
00:38:01,690 --> 00:38:10,510
that's the thing where you're walking towards somebody that's in the same fucking lane as you and

315
00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:15,070
Like you've dealt you both move at the exact same time like football players trying to avoid each other

316
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:17,070
I just did that and I'm trying to

317
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:28,780
This what does it say on the back? I think my hands too small

318
00:38:29,320 --> 00:39:16,440
God damn it. Hold on. I want to do this is a color corrector. What the fuck is this?

319
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:29,880
This is fucked up. Sorry. My OBS is fucked up. Why is it not showing me that? I can't like the scroll is so weird

320
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:37,530
Why is it doing this? I was gonna make myself black and white forget it. It says it says we're best friends. Forget it

321
00:39:37,530 --> 00:39:47,000
I can't I thought I was gonna do something funny. Why this is annoying me. Why I wish I could show this

322
00:39:47,559 --> 00:39:49,750
Now this whole thing is fucked up

323
00:39:49,750 --> 00:40:01,019
What the fuck just brought like a bunch of little ants in my computer to do all this work for me that like that's behind

324
00:40:01,019 --> 00:40:01,460
The scene stuff

325
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:06,380
I mean don't you wish I could just about have a computer with like an ants in it that could like they had lived like a

326
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:08,380
Really comfortable life in there and they can like control everything

327
00:40:09,139 --> 00:40:27,239
And everything's messed up now. I don't know what's I don't know how to fix this. I

328
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:37,130
Opened up the fucking menu and now my camera just went down like ten points in quality

329
00:40:37,570 --> 00:41:05,860
What is happening? Harold Albertson 9a5 just gave 20 community subs. I fucking hate this not you giving those subs this

330
00:41:06,099 --> 00:41:25,960
Okay. Now this is the final picture. I have to like redo this. I

331
00:41:26,599 --> 00:41:35,550
Don't know how this even happened. I touched the gamma once and my in cut my computer exploded

332
00:41:35,710 --> 00:41:38,710
Don't look at those fucking spoilers back there. Get out of here. I

333
00:41:39,349 --> 00:41:56,010
See you freaking like what's over there? What games that what's the next game? I don't even think about it. What happened to the camera?

334
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:38,000
Where did I go? Where am I? Hold on. What? Oh, I should the red I changed the resolution. I brought everything's broken

335
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,119
I actually broke it. I don't know what I did. I have no idea what's going on

336
00:42:41,840 --> 00:43:13,260
Where is this picture? You guys can't see it, but it looks even worse. I don't understand

337
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:15,980
Okay, let me change this

338
00:43:16,019 --> 00:43:33,429
All right up the stream is over the stream ended 30 minutes ago. I don't know what's going on now

339
00:43:33,429 --> 00:44:00,829
I've lost it. It's I've lost control of the stream home again. Well, I'm working backwards. Hold on

340
00:44:14,570 --> 00:44:18,429
This is just every FMV video clip on the Sega CD

341
00:44:25,019 --> 00:44:39,260
HD Jerma add scanlines to it. It's been for I I'm gonna go I'm gonna go I got nothing else planned

342
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:47,079
I'll see you guys tomorrow

343
00:44:47,159 --> 00:44:58,190
Tomorrow we're gonna it was it was Chuck E Cheese man Chuck E Cheese. It's just I feel like I'm in a fucking dream

344
00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:09,300
Can we nominate best one guy moment? But when Chuck E Cheese derailed the whole stream?

345
00:45:11,269 --> 00:45:24,199
That's my nomination. All right. I I don't want to hurt anybody's eyes

346
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:31,780
Yeah, I'm gonna call that. I'm done. I'm done. I'm done. It's fast credits. Holy shit

347
00:45:31,780 --> 00:45:39,760
How many people subscribe today of a lot of very large amount of people actually?

348
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:57,079
This is almost a thousand people. Oh, yeah. Why did I do 50 community subs?

349
00:45:57,559 --> 00:46:01,789
This one's just lost in my brain

350
00:46:02,429 --> 00:46:11,449
fell right right right

351
00:46:11,690 --> 00:46:21,130
Alright, so what are we doing tomorrow? What's the deal tomorrow? Saturday is the DLC part two

352
00:46:21,130 --> 00:46:37,460
I mean we could do more of that game the ship one if not, then

353
00:46:38,139 --> 00:46:52,690
We've got pick custom robo. I got custom robo. I got a bunch of Xbox stuff saw too

354
00:46:53,170 --> 00:46:57,070
We you know what we might be able to do soft

355
00:46:57,309 --> 00:47:03,079
Let me let me see if because I have saw to know how much time and wouldn't remember how much time was left in

356
00:47:03,079 --> 00:47:16,610
Saw one like an hour, right? It was not ten hours left. There was probably maybe an hour in the first one 45 minutes

357
00:47:16,610 --> 00:47:22,690
Yeah, I'll think about it. We're either gonna finish saw one and move on to saw two tomorrow or

358
00:47:23,570 --> 00:47:26,050
I'm gonna play custom robo or

359
00:47:28,269 --> 00:47:43,840
Mystery PC game anything about that. Oh that a lot of fun though. This was fun got a little weird, but it was fun

360
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:47,409
Thanks for watching as always guys

361
00:47:47,570 --> 00:47:50,139

362
00:47:50,139 --> 00:47:52,139
September 13th mark it on your calendar

363
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:58,880
3 p.m. If you're an active sub you can play in the FTK server. It's gonna get streamed

364
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:12,860
It's gonna be all kinds of fun. I am looking forward to it. No more euro streams. This is a euro stream. Yeah, it is

365
00:48:13,539 --> 00:48:25,269
Started it like around noon, right Pacific. That's pretty euro friendly, isn't it?

366
00:48:25,829 --> 00:48:36,260
Where's the radioactive skeleton pick I will show that the minute that I actually have it to a raid raid raid raid

367
00:48:36,260 --> 00:48:38,179
All right, who do you want to raid?

368
00:48:38,179 --> 00:48:46,460
We rating who's available right now. Chuck E. Cheese Chuck E. Cheese is offline

369
00:48:46,460 --> 00:48:57,480
I don't think Chuck E. Cheese is streaming right now. Do it. Anyway a

370
00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:16,559
Raided offline chat. I've seen a lot of Limmy Limmy Limmy Limmy. Who else we got. He's a cool dude

371
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:36,699
Tomato tomato tomatoes a cool dude, too. Yeah, that's too. All right. I I don't know. I don't know

372
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:43,179
What in half? All right half of you go half of you go to tomato half of you go to Limmy

373
00:49:43,179 --> 00:49:50,869
How's that sound lame? Don't split us up. All right

374
00:49:51,510 --> 00:50:03,380
That's not how you do it. Are you do it? You do it. All right number generator 1 to 2. Here we go

375
00:50:03,539 --> 00:50:05,539
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12

All right, we're gonna let me it was fucking awesome too though. Go watch him too

377
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:30,159
And go watch all these people they're all fucking fantastic. I wish you could split the raid. Wouldn't that be cool?

378
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:34,889
If we could like just like spread out a bunch of like it's for a bunch of different places

379
00:50:34,889 --> 00:50:41,820
That would be kind of fun. Is that like too dumb of an idea? Is that like a stupid fucking idea?

380
00:50:41,820 --> 00:50:53,699
I go tell go say hello to Limmy. That's a stupid idea. I wish Chuck E. Cheese is alive right now

381
00:50:53,699 --> 00:51:03,300
We would just dump on him. All right, the next time Chuck E. Cheese is live

382
00:51:03,780 --> 00:51:10,530
I want to make sure I want to dump a raid on Chuck E. Cheese. I'm starting that I'm going for it

383
00:51:10,969 --> 00:51:30,340
Keep an eye out. All right. I'll see you tomorrow

384
00:51:30,820 --> 00:51:40,440
Is this the second time I've rated Limmy, right?

385
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:47,000
Has he does he like look back and go like who the fuck is this guy?
