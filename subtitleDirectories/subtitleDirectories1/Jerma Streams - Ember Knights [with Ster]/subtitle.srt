1
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:49,740
Hey, what's up? How's it going? Early. That's right. Yeah. Hello. Are you there? Yeah.

2
00:00:50,810 --> 00:01:00,299
Hey, everybody. You hear who that is? It's um. Who is it? What's your name? Like it starts

3
00:01:00,299 --> 00:01:09,209
uh, Ster. Oh, it's Ster. Hey, how's it going? And I'm absolutely gonna not be weird anymore.

4
00:01:09,209 --> 00:01:13,530
Why? I just figured like I've been being like too weird and I'm like, I'm done.

5
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:21,140
You're turning over a new leaf here. Yeah. Interesting. I sense that like a lot of the times

6
00:01:22,019 --> 00:01:24,500
I make you uncomfortable and I'm just going to be super normal today.

7
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:32,150
All right. So what that actually means is that in like 25 minutes,

8
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:40,010
you're going to turn your webcam on and just be naked. What? Why? You're going to turn your

9
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:42,409
webcam on. You're going to be wearing like, I don't know what you're going to be doing.

10
00:01:43,739 --> 00:01:50,920
Why can't, why can't you trust me for like one stream? I'm not going to be weird today.

11
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:57,000
Nothing strange is going to happen. Don't, I'm turning over a new leaf. My wife is the same

12
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,719
exact way. And I've talked about this before. Whenever I say I'm going to, can I borrow one

13
00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:05,319
of your bras and I'm going to, I'm not going to do anything weird with it. She won't let me have it.

14
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:13,000
Well, but why does it have to be prefaced with something weird?

15
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:19,240
Well, it's not, it's, it's not going to be weird. I'm going to be totally normal. I'm going to be

16
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:23,240
incredibly professional and we're going to have a fantastic time playing Ember Nights,

17
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:27,639
my second Ember related game. Yeah. That's another thing we have to bring up. I'm,

18
00:02:27,639 --> 00:02:32,199
I'm sorry. I have to apologize to everybody. This is the second Ember game that Stir has wanted us

19
00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:40,789
to play. Um, I, am I stream dying? What's going on here? I hope not. It's just so not used to

20
00:02:40,789 --> 00:02:47,819
being live that it's like rejecting it. Why does it say it's unstable? It's weird. Stir, please.

21
00:02:50,659 --> 00:02:57,620
What? No, you're fine. Relax. All right. So what do you, can you explain what this game is before?

22
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:01,060
And wait before, hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. What are we doing after?

23
00:03:02,659 --> 00:03:09,699
We are 100% today doing the Five Nights at Freddy's watch along stream. Yes.

24
00:03:10,419 --> 00:03:15,379
He's so excited. I've been waiting for this for like a month, by the way. I've got, I've got threats

25
00:03:15,379 --> 00:03:21,300
in the mail from him since the last time we didn't do it. And he thinks I don't know it was him.

26
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:30,259
You promised us. I'll do it. All right. So you, those that don't know, this is Ember Nights.

27
00:03:30,979 --> 00:03:34,500
It is a friend game, but you just, I actually don't even know what this is.

28
00:03:35,379 --> 00:03:41,060
I just don't know. Um, I, I, I'm not entirely sure. It's generally like a co-op beat em up.

29
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:50,419
What was the old game that you co-op and you beat in a month? Uh, Battletoads? Yeah. Sure.

30
00:03:51,219 --> 00:03:56,629
It's Battletoads. It's like Battletoads. It's a roguelike and I don't really know.

31
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:02,650
I've actually heard all jokes aside. I've heard good things. I, that's too. I've heard very good

32
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:06,330
things. I was playing, uh, I was having, you know, a little bit of a roguelike kick again. And I was

33
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:10,090
like, I never tried Ember Nights when it came out and it's got updates. So. Hey, did you tweet?

34
00:04:11,349 --> 00:04:23,769
Uh, no, I didn't tweet. I didn't tweet. I usually just copy your tweet. I don't know a single

35
00:04:23,769 --> 00:04:32,660
streamer that likes tweeting that they're live. Yeah. I don't know why I still do it. Why do I

36
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:40,139
still do that? Do you do that still? Do what? To tweet out every stream you do. Mine are forgettable.

37
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:46,550
So I don't need to let people know. I feel like I just, I have, that's a thing that has been a thing

38
00:04:46,629 --> 00:04:53,699
since like 2012. And I just never stopped doing it. It's the only thing I put on my Twitter.

39
00:04:53,699 --> 00:05:01,589
Well, better than nothing. You can set it up to be, have it be automatic. I could do that,

40
00:05:01,589 --> 00:05:06,709
but I don't know. I feel like I have to be doing it. Then it has like a really lame, it's like a

41
00:05:06,709 --> 00:05:16,259
lame generic default tweet. It doesn't have the extra flair. Why is my character named combo meal?

42
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:28,230
Because I, I felt like it today. All right. Are you, are you good to go? Uh, that depends. Are

43
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:34,420
you good to go? I mean, I am now, by the way, you're only getting face cam for 10 minutes today.

44
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:47,899
I've decided. Oh, why's that? Why? Because I, I had a, I had, look at big side burns and I was

45
00:05:47,899 --> 00:05:53,980
going to do like a big side burn joke. Wait, why, why did you do it? I know. Cause I like, I,

46
00:05:54,939 --> 00:06:03,399
I had to, I had to leave the house and I was like, I have, okay, if I leave the house,

47
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:08,519
then I'm going to look, I'm going to look fucking weird. Cause it was, I did it deliberately weird.

48
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:14,600
I think it was so, it was so bunched up right here. I'll have to do like the shave joke,

49
00:06:16,949 --> 00:06:24,389
have something real weird, but not today. Today is very normal. No, just do wait. Hey, wait,

50
00:06:24,389 --> 00:06:30,060
do you want to have the be as gross as possible challenge with me? Uh, what does that? I don't

51
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:36,490
think I need to explain very much more. Be as, as when, is this like a, like a date or is this

52
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:41,209
just now? No, this is just, it's just like, they just don't shave and don't cut your hair for like

53
00:06:41,209 --> 00:06:48,810
a year. I, I don't, I'm trying to do the not shave again. My beard's getting pretty, pretty chunky,

54
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:54,250
but I've been trimming it so that it doesn't go in my mouth. I don't even know what would happen

55
00:06:54,250 --> 00:07:04,199
to me. Just, and I'm not, when I talk about don't shave, I mean nothing. You don't do any cleanup.

56
00:07:04,519 --> 00:07:10,939
You don't do any trims. It's just let it just go and don't do anything. You, you, you have to do

57
00:07:10,939 --> 00:07:16,379
you a little bit. Well, for me, my mustache gets long enough that it curls into my mouth.

58
00:07:17,259 --> 00:07:24,699
And if I didn't trim that, then it's like, I have, I'm eating my own hair all day. Yeah. I mean,

59
00:07:24,699 --> 00:07:29,910
well, the, the one thing that we, the one thing that I would allow is that just trim it. So that

60
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:35,939
doesn't go in your mouth, but everything else has to stay. Okay. I mean, yeah, go for it. Have you

61
00:07:35,939 --> 00:07:41,259
ever had a beard? No, I, the same thing happens every single time. I get to the point where I,

62
00:07:41,259 --> 00:07:47,879
I get to that exact moment where just let it go for another month and see what it looks like.

63
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:53,779
And I go, no, this is fucked up looking. And I get rid of it. I never crossed that threshold.

64
00:07:55,740 --> 00:08:00,870
I got a break for the awkward stage. That's right. And I never do you, you just, just a mustache,

65
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:05,910
I think would be great for you. My head doesn't feel like especially like a little, a little curly

66
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:11,509
mustache on the ends. It feels like that's your vibe. By the way, I took the is stir my type

67
00:08:11,509 --> 00:08:22,759
test and the answer is no. Well, no one was my type. That was impossible. Can you air dash?

68
00:08:23,939 --> 00:08:34,779
Yeah. Can you eat me whole? No. I put a freebie on there for you. I did. So you probably had more

69
00:08:34,779 --> 00:08:47,299
than most. Yeah. It turns out, sorry. Not compatible. Sorry. I mean, if you got like 20%, I could make

70
00:08:47,299 --> 00:08:54,789
some, um, will you press a for me, please? Are we playing? I'm waiting for you. Wait,

71
00:08:54,789 --> 00:08:58,389
you never explained the grossest part was the grossest possible stream. Just

72
00:08:59,379 --> 00:09:04,340
throw your beard out. You can't walk and chew gum at the same time. I don't even know anything

73
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:07,460
about the game. We're going to like, as soon as I click star game, if you're going to say quiet,

74
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:10,659
there's a cinematic. And then you're going to say like, wait, I don't know what these are.

75
00:09:10,659 --> 00:09:14,740
Is no cinematic in this game is that that's not going to happen. We're going with this. It's like

76
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:20,899
a roguelike. All right. I just want one question answered. Yeah. Is the grossest possible stream

77
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:28,379
just you growing your beard? Yeah. It's just, it just don't. Yeah. How was that gross? Well,

78
00:09:28,379 --> 00:09:31,820
that's not, I mean, I'm just saying like, just, I don't know. Maybe the word is disheveled.

79
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:39,799
What's the right word? So anyone who has a beard is like gross and to show. No, no, I'm saying if

80
00:09:39,799 --> 00:09:44,360
you don't do any, don't like trim it, don't do any maintenance, don't, don't do any trimming,

81
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:50,919
just let it just go caveman style. There are plenty of people that that rock beards phenomenally

82
00:09:50,919 --> 00:09:55,929
well. I'm talking no maintenance at all. I'm just talking, just let it go caveman style.

83
00:09:55,929 --> 00:10:01,509
And I'm talking eyebrows too. And ear hair and the hair that grows in your fucking ear too. Wait,

84
00:10:01,509 --> 00:10:11,909
you shave your eyebrows? No, I fuck. You don't, you don't do any maintenance here? No. Come on,

85
00:10:12,389 --> 00:10:18,710
I was born this way. Okay. And you don't, you don't pull the gross old man hairs out of your ears?

86
00:10:20,659 --> 00:10:25,379
Never. That's not a thing. That's not a thing. I said I wasn't going to be gross today and look

87
00:10:25,379 --> 00:10:32,740
at you. You're just trying to fill the void. I've left. I do like that. It points to you.

88
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:43,539
How is it? How is, how is plucking your eyebrows just slightly? So I just, I don't like when hair

89
00:10:43,539 --> 00:10:47,820
is in the middle. That's fine. If you don't want a unibrow, but when you're saying like,

90
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:56,120
I pluck my brows, that's a whole no, I'm talking about like here. Come on. And look what you got

91
00:10:56,120 --> 00:11:02,470
to do a little bit of maintenance. I think you're ashamed of being a man. I've just told you I wanted

92
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:08,470
to grow all my hair out for like a year. So called it gross and disheveled grow your hair out.

93
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:14,870
You're missing the context. What is this sound effect that you're making right now with your

94
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:23,990
mouth? Am I? This is not you doing this. No, that's just like void waiting for all. We just

95
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:30,230
got to go. We don't have any. No. Enter the tears of the kingdom. Okay. And you skipped the opening

96
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:34,309
cut scene. You fucked up my joke. I didn't because we already saw it before the stream. It didn't

97
00:11:34,309 --> 00:11:42,600
exist. What's going on right now? Why is this so weird? What? What is going on? What's happening

98
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:50,730
with this? I don't know. I'm certainly not me because I'm not doing anything weird. Did you,

99
00:11:50,730 --> 00:12:01,639
did you do this? I don't even know what you're talking about. Are you ready? Oh, dude,

100
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:08,279
is money in this game? Are you serious? There's seriously money. Um, the dash. We both got the

101
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:13,700
money. We share it. That's good. Oh, yeah. You know, you know, dodge rolls. Yeah, you know,

102
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:22,179
dodge rolls. So do we have any context of what's happening right now? I don't think so. I think

103
00:12:22,179 --> 00:12:25,700
the world's ending and we're the only ones who can save it because we're the Ember Knight. Hey,

104
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:35,399
hey, idiot, idiot. Are they high frames? I haven't played this. I'm in a weird mood. I'm sorry.

105
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:42,419
He hasn't streamed in a while and just comes back and is like, I'm going to go super great.

106
00:12:42,419 --> 00:12:45,779
I'm going to do something insane that you guys have never seen, but I'm not going to shave.

107
00:12:48,759 --> 00:12:51,799
But I mean, it was, it's different to everybody here.

108
00:12:58,179 --> 00:13:03,620
Dude, I got, hey, I'm cooking up some wild shit. I'm telling you, I'm not going to shave for two

109
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:12,100
months. Yeah. The German contents got a weird direction. Wait, wait, wait. We have to decide

110
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:20,419
who do we share? I want shield. I want the charge. You didn't even you need. We need to roll for it.

111
00:13:20,419 --> 00:13:25,220
Oh, I guess I'm going to be the fire guy. Well, your head looks like fire. You're a fireman.

112
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:34,570
That's kind of your thing. Oh, you have to hit enemies 10 times to get your thing. Okay. Okay.

113
00:13:34,649 --> 00:13:39,720
So we just wasted them. That's not like a burp at first. And now it doesn't.

114
00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:48,649
Now it does. Annoying. I joke is ruined. Are we going to, are we going to destroy?

115
00:13:48,649 --> 00:13:53,129
I was thinking today because I heard that like Diablo four is like closer launch than I thought.

116
00:13:53,129 --> 00:13:56,809
And I was like, I should ask Jerma if he wants to like do a co-op Diablo four and it comes out

117
00:13:57,370 --> 00:14:02,570
and now he's going to destroy every single barrel. I'm just going to, he's going to read

118
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:07,529
every single item again and I'm going to fucking make the worst content I've ever made in my life.

119
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:17,450
Like it's probably not a good idea. You don't want to play Diablo four. Yeah. I mean, I, I don't,

120
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:26,679
I don't, I don't know what I'm going to do with these ones. I feel like D four is going to be a

121
00:14:26,679 --> 00:14:35,059
game that I play just like on the couch. You're damn it. You're the reason they're making these

122
00:14:35,059 --> 00:14:44,919
games so shit. No. What are you talking about? Couch Diablo sacrilege. Why? You're almost dead

123
00:14:44,919 --> 00:14:55,210
by the way. I am room fine. Yeah. Hey, hey, worry about yourself. I have been and that's why I'm

124
00:14:55,210 --> 00:15:08,419
not taking so much damage. All right. What did you just say? Don't just pick up stuff. I want to

125
00:15:08,419 --> 00:15:12,820
see what it does. Okay. Read it. Whenever you use a skill, you throw a snowball at a random enemy

126
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:17,139
that damages and freezes them and does fight damage. And this one is, is your first skill

127
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:22,259
deals bonus damage. You don't have, what are you doing? What do you have for a skill right now?

128
00:15:23,059 --> 00:15:32,730
Shield charge. Do you want the bonus damage? Yeah. Okay. So now I, I am both fire and ice.

129
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:39,110
You're an anime character. What, what the hell? What was the last sentence that you just said

130
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:46,169
before this? Oh, we just, uh, Diablo four. Oh, you, you talk about, no, no, no. You talk about

131
00:15:46,169 --> 00:15:51,370
me playing on the couch. Oh, on the couch. Yeah. Couch. So if I'm connected to a PC

132
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:55,529
and I play Diablo four with a controller in my hand on the couch, I'm on PC by the way.

133
00:15:56,919 --> 00:16:08,460
Does that make me a bad person? Yeah. Why? I just want the control scheme of the controller. I don't,

134
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:13,100
that's all I want. I'm not, I just want the controls. I just want the controller control scheme.

135
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:17,820
It's totally valid. And if you want to do that, that's fine. But you're the reason the game's bad.

136
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:23,740
No, no, I'm not. Like if people like you didn't exist, they would have made a much better game.

137
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:36,500
Oh, sorry. I, oh, it was, they were the same thing. Hey, if you, you want to compare ours

138
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:43,860
and Diablo two, we can do that. You would win by a long shot. I was like, what, what,

139
00:16:45,059 --> 00:16:54,789
this guy's crazy. I like playing Diablo with a controller. Well, one specific reason

140
00:16:56,100 --> 00:17:01,059
because left clicking with my hand, my hand can start to hurt after a while. After a long gaming

141
00:17:01,059 --> 00:17:04,420
session in Diablo, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click,

142
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:11,500
click, click, click. It hurts. I feel that I only want it to be able to press X. That's it. I

143
00:17:12,059 --> 00:17:16,700
give me the PC. Well, no, no, like I, I, I understand because Victor Fran was like a

144
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:21,579
controller action RPG and it's a very good game. So you know what? I'm going to stop being such an

145
00:17:21,579 --> 00:17:28,380
elitist and I'm going to let you have the W you could sit on your couch and you can play Diablo

146
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:34,299
four. Why not? There's no choices being made. There's nothing you need to do. Why shouldn't

147
00:17:34,299 --> 00:17:40,309
you be able to play it with a controller? It's annoying that I'm going to die before you right

148
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:45,670
now. Cause like what you're saying is like, like I have two health and you have 23. And if I die

149
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:50,230
first, then everything you're saying is valid. You're playing with a controller right now.

150
00:17:51,190 --> 00:18:03,079
How are you? Yeah. Yeah. I'm on, I'm on mouse and keyboard. So

151
00:18:04,359 --> 00:18:10,119
hold on. Point stand. Nope. Hold on a second. I'm going to, I'm defending this to the death.

152
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:18,279
Okay. In the menu of the game on the bottom left, it says controller is recommended for the best

153
00:18:18,279 --> 00:18:24,039
experience. It literally says that I win. Where does it say that? In the menu, right at the bottom

154
00:18:24,039 --> 00:18:32,859
of the menu. Well, you got me there. You and stir should box. I would drop them. There's no way.

155
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:37,180
That's another thing. Like, you know, I was thinking of asking you to play Diablo four and

156
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:42,700
I know it would be a bad time and you know, we should definitely box, but like sometimes in my

157
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:46,619
chat, people like me and you should play guilty gear together. And I'm like, what's the fun in me

158
00:18:46,619 --> 00:18:54,279
just like destroying you? Like, like it's funny for like 30 seconds and then we need to do something

159
00:18:54,279 --> 00:18:59,319
else. Street Fighter, the same thing with boxing. Street Fighter six is, seems like it's going to be

160
00:18:59,319 --> 00:19:05,930
awesome by the way. Does it? It does. Do you, what do you, how much do you know about Street Fighter

161
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:11,289
six? I played the demo. I did the tutorial and the demo and I've been, I know that I want to play

162
00:19:11,289 --> 00:19:16,809
Maria. She's the big giant Dami mommy. And that's like the one thing that has me like still thinking

163
00:19:16,809 --> 00:19:20,650
that I might play the game. I don't really play fighting games with the one thing that's pulling

164
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:30,309
me there is the go and fight random pedestrians on the street. Oh, oh, oh yeah. That was a character

165
00:19:30,309 --> 00:19:36,630
creator and you can make some really weird weirdos for sure. There's a part of that tutorial. I got

166
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:41,589
the demo. I tried it. There's a part of that game that's just like, oh yeah, by the way, um, welcome

167
00:19:41,589 --> 00:19:46,789
to the open world. Everybody around you, you can just challenge them to a fight. And it's even like,

168
00:19:46,789 --> 00:19:50,069
there's just people like on their cell phone, just talking and you can go up and challenge them.

169
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:56,869
And you just, was that a demo? Yeah. You just fight like a regular person. I missed all that.

170
00:19:56,869 --> 00:20:00,950
You missed it. Okay. Well, you got to check that out. I've seen it in the trailers, but you know,

171
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:05,990
I missed it. I only did like the demo and then there was only Ryu and Ken. And then I was like,

172
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:11,240
okay, where's my Dami mommy? And I closed it. I'm going to go to poison.

173
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:20,900
You got one health, dude. I know what we've been talking and shit. There's an inventory.

174
00:20:21,539 --> 00:20:30,019
I think we have to equip stuff. Or maybe not. I think it being in those slots is what there's

175
00:20:30,019 --> 00:20:42,519
like a slot limit. Okay. I assume. Okay. Be careful in this next room there, bud. Oh, I see.

176
00:20:42,519 --> 00:20:50,869
Okay. Holding it. Watch out there, buddy. I didn't get hit. Watch out, pal. Watch your own screen.

177
00:20:55,700 --> 00:21:07,430
Boss next room, pal. Okay, pal. All right there. This is a mini boss. Looks pretty big to me.

178
00:21:08,309 --> 00:21:12,470
All right. You fight it. I'll be I'll be over here with a mushroom.

179
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:40,039
Snake. That was chicken. Fuck. What's he doing? What's he doing? You have the chicken. We both

180
00:21:40,039 --> 00:21:52,710
have 11 health. What? I was behind him. He hit me. He cheated. He dashed forward and hit me behind

181
00:21:52,710 --> 00:22:00,700
him. Cheated. That was fun. The game feels pretty fluid. Yeah, it's pretty crunchy. Pretty cream

182
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:16,470
cheesy. I can I can understand that. Finally. Help. Get these loiterers out of here. Wait. Oh,

183
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:33,049
God. He's got bugs. What was the thing? I forget. What was the thing? Diablo 4. Diablo 4? You are

184
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:41,000
and I'm trying to be nice about this but you probably are the biggest ARPG elitist I've ever

185
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:47,559
met in my whole life. And I mean by a long shot by an unbelievable amount. Thank you.

186
00:22:48,119 --> 00:23:00,460
I appreciate it. How do you actually feel about D4? I feel like. I mean absolutely no disrespect

187
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:06,299
by the way. I mean you're very. That is the compliment. I've put a lot of time in being such

188
00:23:08,069 --> 00:23:14,069
a guy. I feel like it's it's way too simple. There's no choices to making character creation

189
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:17,750
and it's going to get real boring real fast when you get to end game and you're just finding

190
00:23:18,309 --> 00:23:23,299
I oh my unique sword. Oh now I have to find the legendary sword of that exact same sword. Oh now

191
00:23:23,299 --> 00:23:27,460
I have to find the ancient sword like it's just I feel like it's just going to be the same thing

192
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:40,920
over and over again with no actual choices. Okay and I am going to wait until the end game

193
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:51,220
is available. I'm going to hold my opinion until then. Well once you have to farm the third variant

194
00:23:51,220 --> 00:24:00,819
of unique status of your same weapon then you let me know and then and then finally play POE so you

195
00:24:00,819 --> 00:24:05,059
have something to actually compare it to or Torchlight Infinite. What was the whole rant

196
00:24:05,059 --> 00:24:09,220
that you went on that you said that like Titanfall hypnotized everybody to pretend that it was a good

197
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:13,779
game or something? Titanfall? Didn't you say like Titanfall? Well back when Titanfall came out you

198
00:24:13,779 --> 00:24:17,940
were like everybody thought it was great and you were like I don't like it and it's not good.

199
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:23,380
You said it was like you said it was like I don't think it was Titanfall. You said that Titanfall

200
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:29,349
was like an illusion game or something whatever it was. I've definitely said this this was not

201
00:24:29,349 --> 00:24:33,190
my chat saying they think it was Valorant. I think Titanfall 2 is one of the best

202
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:39,269
games like FPS games ever so I doubt I said that. I'm probably thinking of a different game.

203
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:43,430
Titanfall was good. I thought Titanfall was good. I've said that about vampire survivors for sure.

204
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:54,700
That's maybe what it was so now I'm like this um like what why Titanfall? I don't know where you

205
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:59,180
pulled Titanfall out of here. Where did Titanfall come from? It hypnotized yeah it was we're talking

206
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:04,539
about vampire survivors it hypnotized everyone there's no no I've also just said this about

207
00:25:04,539 --> 00:25:09,420
Loop Hero. Absolutely nothing happens in Loop Hero. I swear I'm telling you you said this before.

208
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:16,119
Well Loop Hero was a long time ago and I probably said that about that as well. Let me see what I

209
00:25:16,119 --> 00:25:25,349
just got. So this stuff is level one Loop Hero. I've never played it. You would fucking love Loop

210
00:25:25,349 --> 00:25:35,690
Hero dude. Would I? If I'm saying it's a game that makes you think it's a game you will love it.

211
00:25:35,690 --> 00:25:41,369
Can't you just like enjoy shit and can't you just like have fun? I enjoy a lot of shit very

212
00:25:41,369 --> 00:25:44,569
passionately that's why I'm saying that there's other things better that you can be spending

213
00:25:44,569 --> 00:25:51,109
your time on other than like vampire survivors. I will not let you sit here and talk about that

214
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:55,430
Do you want to play a good game? Do you want to like try a cool game I recommend? Oh like oh Jade

215
00:25:55,430 --> 00:26:01,509
Cocoon? Want to play POE? Yeah dude Jade Cocoon. Jade Cocoon is one of the rarest video games of

216
00:26:01,509 --> 00:26:08,869
all time. Is it? You can't find it anywhere. Did you actually look? Yeah dude I looked everywhere.

217
00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:16,099
That's a shame because everyone's holding on to it because it's such a such a little gem.

218
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:20,230
It's a good series.

219
00:26:28,069 --> 00:26:34,200
I know I know what that reference is. Oh you mean little gem. I thought you meant Jade Cocoon.

220
00:26:36,359 --> 00:26:41,799
Jade Cocoon 2 was the game that was available and I remember I asked you I said hey dude I can't

221
00:26:41,799 --> 00:26:49,960
find Jade Cocoon 1. Is Jade Cocoon 2 okay? I believe it was like $400 and you were like

222
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:54,839
no dude and that's the wrong one. Yeah I heard I never played it but I heard Jade Cocoon 2 was

223
00:26:54,839 --> 00:27:00,299
terrible. Can somebody confirm that with me? I it's they're expensive and they're rare.

224
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:07,480
All right do you want a gem of wisdom or do you want something else? Uh or or gem gem a

225
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:16,009
path let's power up. Wait wait wait hold on. I don't know what this is. Two is better? It's

226
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:25,430
$60 on eBay. Two is good. I guess I was it's like 50 bucks. How much is Jade Cocoon 1? Did I just

227
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:51,460
make that number up? Nope I didn't. It's a hundred bucks. $75. Okay I start at what point is how much

228
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:56,900
percentage over something that's expensive isn't over complete overreaction? Like what percentage

229
00:27:56,900 --> 00:28:04,259
wise? Like if I said dude it's like 500 bucks and if it was like 200 bucks is that still okay?

230
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:13,900
Uh I believe I think that's pretty bad because because you're saying dude it's fine you're saying

231
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:18,460
it very confidently and very assertively and very aggressively so it needs to be more accurate the

232
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:23,099
more you're like if you're like I think it's like 500 and if it was 200 that'd be okay that's true

233
00:28:23,099 --> 00:28:27,339
but you you sound like you know what you're talking about you really have no idea yeah that's right

234
00:28:27,339 --> 00:28:36,579
that's you're right that's bad that's bad that's that's bad dude if I had been like um I I think

235
00:28:36,579 --> 00:28:42,579
that game is like expensive I don't know I'm not sure but I got angry with you and told you it was

236
00:28:42,579 --> 00:28:49,269
$400 it's not even correct I got angry and just like guessed higher

237
00:28:52,099 --> 00:28:54,660
all right do you get to pick a skill here too are we both picking one?

238
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:14,339
I think we both pick it's the second yeah yeah okay I pick and then you pick I like that

239
00:29:18,069 --> 00:29:21,990
well you're literally a little bit of a magician okay let's get the hearts the healing let's get

240
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:27,190
the healing fountain I think how do we what is it the middle mouse okay you're on controller

241
00:29:27,829 --> 00:29:36,940
I don't know what my the recommended way by the way yeah I know so you can dash over there healing

242
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:49,609
spring oh oh you're you're taking it all oh whoops okay sorry all right I did not think it was

243
00:29:49,609 --> 00:29:54,730
gonna do that I we've shared everything in the game so far I figured we both could share

244
00:29:54,730 --> 00:30:00,970
that together we've both been getting the same drops and that is true no the the shop we can

245
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:19,079
only buy like the same core items frozen frozen oh you froze him so let me practice this because

246
00:30:19,079 --> 00:30:26,440
are you doing perfect uh I don't know what that is okay so when you hold down your ability it's

247
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:30,519
gonna fill up that bar you have to wait till it gets completely full and you have to time it

248
00:30:30,519 --> 00:30:35,880
correctly to let go at the perfect time and then it does more stuff just to let you know well if

249
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:43,299
you're like practicing it you're still consuming uses and yeah you'll you'll get it you're much

250
00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:55,640
more than I am I feel like I had a lot to talk about today like I feel like there was a lot of

251
00:30:55,640 --> 00:31:01,349
things where I was you know what I want to get his opinion on this like what I don't know you've

252
00:31:01,349 --> 00:31:06,950
asked me like one question it'll come I have a question yeah um as a reminder not being weird

253
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:13,029
today what is your like deepest fantasy and as a fantasy I'm defining as something that

254
00:31:13,029 --> 00:31:19,910
you know will never happen riding on okay I got it riding on a roller coaster alone alone yeah

255
00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:23,509
like having a theme park completed by being able to go to like disney world completely alone with

256
00:31:23,509 --> 00:31:29,910
like the five people I feel like that could happen if you really wanted to have I don't think so

257
00:31:30,869 --> 00:31:43,930
okay mine is a notebook where I've taken notes in it for a long time and every single page is

258
00:31:43,930 --> 00:31:48,890
perfectly filled up with the exact like cool thing I wanted to write in it and there's like

259
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:53,049
drawings to go along with it like if you look through the notebook when you go along like it's

260
00:31:53,049 --> 00:31:59,529
it's like a macula perfect handwriting it's like a joy to look at how is that not achievable

261
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:07,369
that's simply not it's how could how how could you do that so fire somebody because no every

262
00:32:07,369 --> 00:32:12,809
time you like go to write a page of notes you start then like you realize like I don't need to

263
00:32:12,809 --> 00:32:17,210
like I don't need to take notes on this anymore like it's not as in depth as I thought like I'm

264
00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:21,210
over like you know and then like every page doesn't line up with the page before it like

265
00:32:21,210 --> 00:32:27,339
you're trying to get like a chronological set of notes you know I'm saying I mean you you could

266
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:31,420
compile a bunch of stuff and if somebody helped you put it together and clean it up

267
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:37,299
that's just a whole career about people doing that it's like literally like proofreading

268
00:32:38,019 --> 00:32:57,180
copy reading all kinds of stuff like that watch out final phase oh he shut down

269
00:32:57,900 --> 00:33:07,259
you were supposed to keep dpsing I didn't die because if you just hit him if you just hit up

270
00:33:07,259 --> 00:33:20,890
with me I'm fine I didn't die back up you could also rent out an amusement park all right I have

271
00:33:20,890 --> 00:33:29,640
a feeling that renting out Disney World for a week is probably going to cost you millions of

272
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:35,480
dollars yeah it doesn't need to be Disney World yeah I'm just saying like I've I okay well then

273
00:33:36,039 --> 00:33:40,359
what's an amusement park there's a there's a um there's a water park near where I live

274
00:33:40,359 --> 00:33:46,519
and they sell like the exclusive pass like skip the line I was there nobody buys it there was a

275
00:33:46,519 --> 00:33:53,079
line of like 60 people for like a water slide nobody in the premium one and it's like it's

276
00:33:53,079 --> 00:34:00,339
like ten dollars more expensive oh it was crazy craziest thing I've ever seen in my life so it's

277
00:34:00,339 --> 00:34:04,500
basically like you're there alone like you just walk you get you get the satisfaction of walking

278
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:15,500
past 60 people and just doing it as well did I buy it no I was in line give it to me please

279
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:23,079
but if I ever go again give it to me please hey that's because you lived on the bus because

280
00:34:23,079 --> 00:34:31,159
you didn't know the rules I dodged the most enemy attacks too by the way I also dealt all the damage

281
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:46,199
what else did I do oh you ate all the food wow good for you I killed more enemies yeah it's called

282
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:52,659
last hitting okay I'm stepping it up oh yeah do you really want to make this like a whole

283
00:34:52,659 --> 00:35:01,210
like a whole thing oh one of my biggest fantasies just came true right there I beat stir in a video

284
00:35:01,210 --> 00:35:13,829
game no we both had two stars oh shit now I know that like I have to actually care now because like

285
00:35:13,829 --> 00:35:33,130
I don't want you to get any wings shit yeah yeah you're playing now too hmm armor is always good

286
00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:50,570
yeah I'm going armor yeah I'm going with this more skill damage so I do one and then the other

287
00:35:50,570 --> 00:36:01,800
back to back apparently we got a buff in the horn I hate these sound effects it's like dial up

288
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:15,980
yeah I feel like oh so Esper actually summoned you I would have expected him to perish from

289
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:23,019
old age before actually making a move cringe this is the first time I've seen an ember knight

290
00:36:23,019 --> 00:36:28,300
the defenders of the nexus thanks for telling me what I am is that supposed to be a joke a sneeze

291
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:34,780
could blow you away oh fuck it's hardly worth the effort but I'll give you something to play with

292
00:36:35,579 --> 00:36:46,420
cringe and no you know you go ahead oh you do it this is the only minuscule portion of my power

293
00:36:46,420 --> 00:37:02,739
try not to break too quickly yeah I could do it too yeah you can pretty good oh fuck I died

294
00:37:03,059 --> 00:37:17,050
I was being a fucking idiot and just I don't know I had fun it doesn't matter oh defeat mini

295
00:37:17,050 --> 00:37:31,030
boss to revive you that wasn't the mini boss okay well I hope you like watching what I was

296
00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:38,840
just like admit I was mashing X and doing like a wicked weird face I thought it was fun you seem

297
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:57,030
to be in a mood today yeah sometimes sometimes don't worry I'll get you back pal pick those up

298
00:37:57,590 --> 00:38:12,570
this is a rogue like be careful I'm aware I'm aware you don't want to die on the right side

299
00:38:13,289 --> 00:38:22,230
right side okay where do I go now uh yeah use uh your one more you're using it not that often

300
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:29,159
I'm using I'm using it pretty often uh there was a like doors up here up here using my one

301
00:38:40,809 --> 00:38:46,809
oh what those things icicles randomly explode yeah the icicles hurt if you touch them the icicles hurt

302
00:38:46,809 --> 00:38:50,090
you can't dodge through them and the doors over on the left side by the way so you're kind of

303
00:38:50,090 --> 00:38:57,880
fighting in a weird spot okay good advice it's fine because all the healing items are for me now

304
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:02,199
left side right yep there you go there's more than one door

305
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:16,679
anybody that comes to stream right now don't even doesn't even know you're here

306
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:21,719
oh we're getting a five nights at freddy's watch stream and we're getting the ember knight watch

309
00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:37,670
think you have to you're gonna get all the stars too and it's gonna be like you're gonna piss me off

310
00:39:38,389 --> 00:39:57,099
yeah make sure you don't skip that screen oh dude oh dude oh someone's getting some move speed level

311

312
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:38,940

313
00:40:44,329 --> 00:40:49,210
dude he's circles that was gonna be a huge surprise now I know I don't even I don't have the

314
00:40:49,210 --> 00:40:54,760
motivation to do it again tomorrow just took all the motivation from me I was gonna be a surprise

315
00:40:54,760 --> 00:41:04,500
to my community um I apologize maybe you'll play a cool game instead I need to have some room in

316
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:14,889
between now I think it'd be a lot easier with like another guy yeah it would be you got this

317
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:25,619
though you're doing fine there's no dk barrel that you can just pick up and throw and I can jump out

318
00:41:25,619 --> 00:41:37,320
of it wait I these are locked I have to actually swap something out now wait why is it showing me

319
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:42,199
it's showing me stat upgrade for me but it's making me choose from your combo meal body

320
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:50,099
I'm confused uh I don't know when I get revived can we do the thing that we that they do in donkey

321
00:41:50,420 --> 00:42:08,179
country where I go you can you can do whatever you want but personally I love monkeys those

322
00:42:08,179 --> 00:42:21,849
people that get it you get it those people that don't sorry I don't like these enemies so true I

327
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:33,610
let's go for it now let's like go in the shop and like over gear you you know what I mean do you need

328
00:44:33,610 --> 00:44:42,699
this I don't think I can use it what do you need this I don't think I can use it hello is that

329
00:44:42,699 --> 00:44:51,559
even coming through to you no oh never mind what was it I was recording oh all right so here

330
00:44:51,559 --> 00:45:04,579
hundred and you got a lot more money than I do oh I'll take it I'll take that can you buy something

331
00:45:04,579 --> 00:45:12,099
for me um I just spent a lot of money I don't have money for these now okay I I unfortunately

332
00:45:12,099 --> 00:45:37,239
used it on myself watch out these enemies are tough watch out dude dude great work if I come

333
00:45:37,239 --> 00:45:43,400
back and beat you how could that possibly happen anything is possible I killed the whole mini

334
00:45:43,400 --> 00:46:08,139
boss by myself you know what I believe in you if anyone can do it it's you I think we're actually

335
00:46:08,139 --> 00:46:13,880
doing really well I mean this is our first run ever yeah we're at the end of stage two soon

336
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:22,309
let's take a step you don't want the healing fountain hmm I mean you yeah let's do that

337
00:46:22,949 --> 00:46:28,150
you could use it I feel like we probably should have taken the gem because the boss rooms seem

338
00:46:28,150 --> 00:46:35,130
to also always heal you beforehand I think we can go to full yeah we should have taken the gem

339
00:46:35,130 --> 00:47:00,409
is there like a a greater of application um I don't know perfect I don't think so all right

340
00:47:01,210 --> 00:47:08,889
can we just take a quick second to see what do the stats do uh agility is was 10 move speed

341
00:47:08,889 --> 00:47:25,480
precision is crit chance or something okay so crit chance they're spoiled it so we didn't get

342
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:36,760
the announcement oh wait people together people think that was real um what was the announcement

343
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:46,940
I didn't hear it that I'm gonna play sorcery oh you've already beat like all of them like six

344
00:47:46,940 --> 00:47:55,019
times have you ever played sorcery yeah you did right yeah beat the first one you didn't

345
00:47:55,019 --> 00:47:59,820
do this I I might have done like half of the second one I can't remember second one's the

346
00:47:59,820 --> 00:48:09,079
best one I feel like stirred now would appreciate that game a lot more what do you think maybe I

347
00:48:09,079 --> 00:48:19,099
mean I liked it when I played it I honestly can't remember why I stopped not that stir

348
00:48:20,059 --> 00:48:26,199
back years ago wouldn't know but you like that game is right up your alley in your current

349
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:42,099
my current form the current form maybe yeah maybe I try it yeah maybe we play peewee together

350
00:48:42,739 --> 00:48:52,170
or not together you yeah but you whatever yeah whatever why is so loud very loud maybe you spend

351
00:48:52,170 --> 00:48:58,730
the five hundred dollars for gate cocoon what is this what's going on we got yeah see it always

352
00:48:58,730 --> 00:49:09,590
heals and now we like we have like full health already we shouldn't have done it shit are you

353
00:49:09,590 --> 00:49:21,750
ready person to get hit loses first person to get hit loses okay I knew you were going to just go

354
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:28,949
walk and stand in the corner you can play at that game and my character can actually go invisible

355
00:49:29,590 --> 00:49:56,280
I'm pretty ranged what I'm invisible yes yeah you need like a cheap way to win right now

356
00:49:56,280 --> 00:50:36,920
because you were dead for the whole stage what watch out for his ice attack watch out for his

357
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:58,219
ice watch out he's invincible but let's watch out for the sword dude you just froze the ice king

358
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:22,650
that's insane that's true yeah tps time if you're gonna beat me it's now guys I want to see these

359
00:51:22,650 --> 00:51:35,420
oh shit what shit yourself right I got liquid all of me so you want this

360
00:51:36,980 --> 00:51:41,619
it's like every time I take a sip out of my drink it's oh it's like way over here

361
00:51:41,619 --> 00:51:44,739
because I hate it when it's in the way of my other monitor so I have to like

362
00:51:45,539 --> 00:51:50,579
crouch creep over here drink out of my drink I turned into like a goblin when I go take a sip

363
00:51:50,579 --> 00:51:54,969
all right what do you want do you want this um you should probably take it

364
00:51:55,610 --> 00:52:02,739
it's weird that the bosses only give one power up and everything else

365
00:52:02,739 --> 00:52:11,530
like duplicates it for us you look like luigi luigi's fucking cool luigi is the cooler brother

366
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:38,440
okay like being luigi's not cool new outfit wow mario is categorically better who's it gonna be

367
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:48,260
oh I hope it's me okay receive the most damage oh god hit too many times looks like

368
00:52:48,980 --> 00:53:03,719
is it pretty good yeah I was dead the whole entire level that that's pretty good for coming back in

369
00:53:03,719 --> 00:53:08,280
the first dying in the first room and then coming back in the last room you got the spectator

370
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:13,639
badge I've never got that before that's crazy all right this one's now the real one our our

371
00:53:13,639 --> 00:53:28,650
damage taken is actually one damage apart yeah that's weird yeah that must be a bug this level

372
00:53:28,650 --> 00:53:36,599
looks cool I think uh when when early access came out this was the end of the game this stage

373
00:53:36,599 --> 00:53:41,880
so I don't I I'm like vaguely remember seeing someone play it how long has this been in early

374
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:51,130
access for I think it's been a year not 100 sure it's pretty it's pretty good an early access game

375
00:53:51,130 --> 00:54:01,690
that was in early access for like a year good yeah yeah yeah it's pretty good that's pretty good

376
00:54:02,650 --> 00:54:13,780
it seems like a pretty good turn around what's wrong I got hit yeah we also oh this is me uh

377
00:54:14,579 --> 00:54:23,619
poisons them aren't you poisoning people uh I am so I should probably take it already I

378
00:54:23,619 --> 00:54:34,969
apparently you like level one to level two I already have that I like that I also have fire

379
00:54:35,610 --> 00:54:44,699
I have to replace something though don't I um I don't know I don't know if you get the second

403
00:57:59,820 --> 00:58:08,280
die and then it gives you 700 bonus damage and then three extra lives this is different I like

404
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:23,909
restarting my identity is restarting do I want any of these do a golem cosplay just like like

405
00:58:23,909 --> 00:58:28,469
grease in my hair and have it come down like this and just like I don't know make myself look old

406
00:58:29,110 --> 00:58:59,210
hey exactly why I should never have shaved I have no shirt on just eat a raw fish isn't it funny

407
00:58:59,210 --> 00:59:03,530
that when you know you only have less than 10 health that's when you actually care more than

408
00:59:03,530 --> 00:59:09,050
anything yeah I don't know how my armor works the 14 armor I have is that just damage reduction

409
00:59:09,050 --> 00:59:16,519
I was hoping that would be like extra life shop game is saved volume impression the whole time

410
00:59:17,619 --> 00:59:25,019
no healing whenever you crit heal games over wait what is it whenever I crit I heal

411
00:59:25,579 --> 00:59:30,230
hmm

412
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:43,289
could you just talk like that forever good you just like I don't want drama anymore I want to play

413
00:59:43,289 --> 00:59:55,190
with golem that was cow from cow and chicken I guess they're one in the same I never never

414
00:59:55,190 --> 01:00:15,980
thought about it chicken it's me cow it kind of is a little if I really tried I I might be able

415
01:00:15,980 --> 01:00:23,079
to do it although that that that's Charlie Adler the voice actor one of the most talented human

416
01:00:23,079 --> 01:00:33,800
beings to ever live did almost every voice on that show if you didn't know I didn't know

417
01:00:44,730 --> 01:00:50,250
I gained 19 health that room from hitting things I don't think people understand just how much

418
01:00:50,250 --> 01:01:00,139
influence red guy had on my entire life who's red guy cow and chicken I hated that show so

419
01:01:00,699 --> 01:01:06,900
I kind of remember him I'm sorry I know like you're telling us about your like formative

420
01:01:06,900 --> 01:01:12,019
childhood years and like what meant the most to you and I didn't like it and I know that I

421
01:01:12,019 --> 01:01:18,250
don't like it doesn't like something else but like cow and chicken you don't like anything I

422
01:01:18,250 --> 01:01:26,019
yeah I didn't like your top cartoons growing up top like give me like a top three I that that's

423
01:01:26,019 --> 01:01:39,500
like I don't even know if I could do that pop oh okay I think oh god I did a I did a like uh

424
01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:45,510
cartoon network top shows like quiz thing on stream a while ago so I'm like prepped for this

425
01:01:45,510 --> 01:01:51,420
okay but it was specifically Cartoon Network though what good shows did Nickelodeon even have

426
01:01:51,420 --> 01:01:59,369
oh stop what are you talking about Doug you didn't like Doug how does that hit me this game sucks

427
01:01:59,369 --> 01:02:06,070
fuck that behind him yeah you were saying Doug I didn't like Doug you didn't like Doug

428
01:02:06,710 --> 01:02:15,639
what about Rugrats Doug Rugrats Ren and Stimpy um this is not a cartoon but salute your shorts

429
01:02:15,639 --> 01:02:24,650
that show was come on Spongebob you don't like Spongebob Spongebob's okay hey Arnold

430
01:02:24,650 --> 01:02:31,369
Ren and Stimpy was good Ren and Stimpy should not have been on tv Rocco's modern life did you like

431
01:02:31,369 --> 01:02:38,489
I didn't like that either I didn't like rock rock I can't believe it I don't know Cartoon Network

432
01:02:38,489 --> 01:02:43,769
was just better okay top three we got to compare top three is not like what I don't like you're

433
01:02:43,769 --> 01:02:46,409
going to get because if I do a top three that's the things that I did like then people will be

434
01:02:46,969 --> 01:02:51,769
bass-pilled and true fact it and if I tell you all the things I don't like then I'm a loser

435
01:02:51,769 --> 01:03:14,809
shit okay favorite cartoon grown up like open your stream and see what like how deep in thought you

436
01:03:14,809 --> 01:03:23,510
are that's got to be the Looney Tunes has to be that makes a lot of sense has to be Looney Tunes

437
01:03:23,510 --> 01:03:29,800
I and that's not even Cart that's completely disconnected I honestly the old Looney Tunes

438
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:35,400
routines are some of the most engaging some of the most fun the Roadrunner I think that Wiley

439
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:47,670
Coyote and Roadrunner is probably some of my favorite media ever uh Tom and Jerry was I liked

440
01:03:47,670 --> 01:03:54,940
it but I liked Daffy and Bugs's bullshit that they would do back and forth so your top three

441
01:03:54,940 --> 01:04:00,969
is Looney Tunes well I just gave you one it's honestly probably Rugrats I loved Rugrats it was

442
01:04:00,969 --> 01:04:07,769
just such a well Rugrat well I wouldn't put it in top three Rugrat I loved Rug how could you not

443
01:04:07,769 --> 01:04:15,769
like Rugrats yeah it was a great show top three especially because I'm I'm Ren and Stimpy has to

444
01:04:15,769 --> 01:04:21,610
be up there too I it has to be Ashley tells me all the time about how Rugrats is the ugliest show

445
01:04:21,610 --> 01:04:27,139
ever made and her as an artist I hear about it a lot she's not wrong a lot of the old fucking

446
01:04:27,139 --> 01:04:34,599
disgusting hey you're talking about the the class geek super style come on I like the one episode

447
01:04:34,599 --> 01:04:41,909
where is it stews having or one of the kids is like having like a fever dream how's about it uh

448
01:04:41,909 --> 01:04:49,059
class geek super were it was a they had a studio it was a I think it was I'm trying to remember

449
01:04:49,059 --> 01:04:57,190
correctly you're a dude oh it was it was two names it was certain style that was in it was um

450
01:04:57,750 --> 01:05:07,590
did class gate super do uh what the hell what the hell what the hell rocket power was class

451
01:05:07,590 --> 01:05:15,960
geek super they're they're just as ugly stop it I imagine so they did um wild wild thornberries

452
01:05:15,960 --> 01:05:25,300
was osco well uh was class key super right did you like the wild thornberries no I think like

453
01:05:25,300 --> 01:05:30,340
Nigel is funny for like a little bit to just hear him talk and that was about it

454
01:05:30,340 --> 01:05:41,219
okay well all right it's probably all the old looney tunes combined with the x-men cartoon

455
01:05:41,219 --> 01:05:49,369
I would say that's probably number two or three the old x-men cartoon I know it's still the one

456
01:05:49,369 --> 01:06:01,619
where Wolverine's looking at the picture in bed is that the one thing that you have from this whole

457
01:06:01,699 --> 01:06:07,960
entire series because that's that's the one meme it's the meme all right I remember like one other

458
01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:12,920
episode that got dubbed over with juggernaut that's it the Batman animated series was up there as

459
01:06:12,920 --> 01:06:22,260
well probably three spongebob first three or four seasons of spongebob first five seasons of spongebob

460
01:06:22,260 --> 01:06:33,210
get out of here get out of town uh if you want to go even further than that we got some of the

461
01:06:33,210 --> 01:06:39,980
adult swims up uh aquatine aquatine hunger force that's the first smart thing you've said all day

462
01:06:39,980 --> 01:06:54,789
oh please aquatine was was awesome venture brothers was good yeah but that's not I they're

463
01:06:54,789 --> 01:06:58,920
they're not part of this you know what I mean like they're animes that's what that's like if I ask

464
01:06:58,920 --> 01:07:07,559
I ask you what your favorite cartoon is and you say um like one punch man how is that unfair

465
01:07:07,559 --> 01:07:11,590
all right what are we are we going back to the main I feel like I feel like we're staying in

466
01:07:11,590 --> 01:07:19,380
the category of like daytime tv cartoon well but you have and then when you bring in like oh my

467
01:07:19,380 --> 01:07:24,500
favorite cartoon was one punch man that's that's weird well then you have to give me some parameters

468
01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:29,369
to work in or we're just working within the parameters of like daytime tv cartoons then

469
01:07:29,369 --> 01:07:35,929
it's got to be the x-men animated series batman animated animated series rug rats doug rennan

470
01:07:35,929 --> 01:07:41,769
stimpy um cow and chicken like some of those uh uh like johnny bravo i'm just trying to think of

471
01:07:41,769 --> 01:07:52,139
that era like i watched looney tunes i watched them all cat dog is another one classic uh invader

472
01:07:52,139 --> 01:07:59,989
zim i did not really catch or care about until much later so i can't say that on that i'm not

473
01:07:59,989 --> 01:08:06,309
coping i'm setting the parameters there's no opinion in setting the parameter our real monsters

474
01:08:06,309 --> 01:08:22,420
was also class geek supo so did you like that one no it was okay but like you know it was just okay

475
01:08:22,420 --> 01:08:29,449
i just don't think you liked the class geek supo style did you not like the art style that's not

476
01:08:29,449 --> 01:08:34,100
right it has to be what it is i think our real monsters works a bit because they're all supposed

477
01:08:34,100 --> 01:08:42,390
to be ugly okay well what is your top five top 10 cartoons that you watched i cared about

478
01:08:43,510 --> 01:08:51,430
not i can't believe not even brought up at all like ed ed and eddie for real but this guy's hell

479
01:08:51,430 --> 01:08:56,229
wait a minute i don't even care about ed ed and eddie you think that our real monsters is

480
01:08:56,229 --> 01:09:01,670
ugly and all those i don't like the ugly art styles and i don't like the weird kind of way

481
01:09:02,149 --> 01:09:07,029
ed ed and eddie had a wild art style they're almost the same it wasn't ugly it wasn't ugly

482
01:09:07,029 --> 01:09:14,119
no it's not the same it was very close to that kind of old class geek supo style yes it was

483
01:09:14,119 --> 01:09:19,560
ed ed and eddie would fit in the same category as class geek supo and it's great i liked it i just

484
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:27,539
don't think i'd put it in my top five all right ed ed and eddie let's get another one oh hold on

485
01:09:27,539 --> 01:09:32,579
we have like items we can still purchase more things here if you didn't from the shrine oh i

486
01:09:32,579 --> 01:09:37,699
was like reading that we can start with like uh twice the amount of health that we started with

487
01:09:37,699 --> 01:09:47,180
last time that's pretty good and there's like three different tiers of it so should we unlock

488
01:09:47,180 --> 01:09:54,760
this i'm unlocking this one we don't share these points right uh no so you like unlock the first

489
01:09:54,760 --> 01:10:01,340
one and then the other ones purchase three more upgrades to unlock the other stuff and then even

490
01:10:01,340 --> 01:10:04,939
press e you can respect everything anytime it seems i'm just doing health and money

491
01:10:10,729 --> 01:10:14,250
yeah see this is why it's a roguelike look now we have look at how much health we have

492
01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:31,189
okay so at ed and eddie uh grim adventures billy and mandy yep that's that's a good one um i forget

493
01:10:31,189 --> 01:10:37,850
what was what else was on there oh my god how did i how did i screw this up i can't believe it all

494
01:10:37,850 --> 01:10:46,250
the uh donald duck all the old disney stuff donald duck you like you like yeah like an hour the old

495
01:10:46,250 --> 01:10:54,220
donald duck cartoons he i i love the old donald duck cartoons donald duck would just like fucking

496
01:10:54,220 --> 01:10:59,340
lose his shit he would somebody would just donald duck had a really fucking challenging life

497
01:11:01,510 --> 01:11:05,590
something bad happened to donald duck every episode i don't understand why everyone's like

498
01:11:05,590 --> 01:11:09,829
oh wow i can't believe donald duck's got such a temper yeah he gets fucked with every episode

499
01:11:09,829 --> 01:11:16,500
horrible fucking things happen to him every single day i think i'd be a little upset too

500
01:11:19,590 --> 01:11:27,420
uh yeah the old disney stuff too donald duck especially flapjack that's a good one

501
01:11:29,399 --> 01:11:39,079
oh he's in the bow wait a minute maybe oh just stand in the back and use the bow it actually

502
01:11:39,079 --> 01:11:49,050
does not go that far that's a might be hard to use but i'll try it i believe in you i'm gonna i'm

503
01:11:49,050 --> 01:11:56,119
gonna say sword guy okay uh all right so is that would you consider that to be an accurate

504
01:11:56,119 --> 01:12:04,279
complete list i i'm confident in saying eddie and eddie and grim adventures are like top two

505
01:12:04,279 --> 01:12:09,420
they could even share the same place i don't care okay and then third i i don't i don't really know

506
01:12:09,420 --> 01:12:14,619
like teen titans was pretty pretty good i liked flapjack i like chowder but i don't feel as

507
01:12:14,619 --> 01:12:30,760
strongly about them as uh the top two i i remember i teen titans confused me a lot because i didn't

508
01:12:30,760 --> 01:12:35,640
really pay that much attention to it but i i caught another i caught an episode of it and

509
01:12:35,640 --> 01:12:42,539
they have a different they have like a different series now it's like team titans go and i i've

510
01:12:42,539 --> 01:12:47,829

512
01:12:54,729 --> 01:12:58,649
really but i i saw that they came with it i didn't know if it was the same thing or not

513
01:13:00,390 --> 01:13:10,569
well that's because you you had to be into it you had to be shipping raven and beast boy

514
01:13:10,569 --> 01:13:13,130
if you weren't doing that then were you really even watching it

515
01:13:30,220 --> 01:13:36,260

527
01:15:11,939 --> 01:15:19,899
be clear are you muting me no you're here okay wait are you okay you're actually i thought you

528
01:15:19,899 --> 01:15:31,060
were actually getting up to go do something i know you have like the old person thing you have to

529
01:15:31,060 --> 01:15:45,100
like pee every 20 seconds apparently i do feel like it says something unhinged germa praise is

530
01:15:45,100 --> 01:15:59,300
that what this says germa praise what i thought it said germa praise pretend he didn't hear him

531
01:15:59,300 --> 01:16:07,289
oh pray like you started i was like oh i thought it said that i from rain oh lord i told you i'm not

532
01:16:07,289 --> 01:16:15,479
even being weird today these are like normal people opinions a lot of people agree uh can you pick

533
01:16:15,479 --> 01:16:28,779
your item please uh i don't know is there a description of how poison works i feel like

534
01:16:28,859 --> 01:16:35,020
you're the kind of like coward who would use poison like if i ever die from poison it was probably

535
01:16:35,020 --> 01:16:42,699
you i'm not taking it you can take some poison shit poison is guaranteed damage when you know

536
01:16:42,699 --> 01:16:49,979
that you can't be there to do it tick damage is so huge affliction warlock was one of the best

537
01:16:49,979 --> 01:16:59,140
classes in all of world of warcraft you know why why because the dot damage you just walk away and

538
01:16:59,140 --> 01:17:03,140
you could just dodge mechanics and not actually focus on like contributing actually that is a

539
01:17:03,140 --> 01:17:08,100
huge deal because you can pay attention to the encounter and not worry about not worry about you

540
01:17:08,100 --> 01:17:11,619
know don't stand in the shit as they say right don't stand in the thing you could pay attention

541
01:17:11,619 --> 01:17:17,380
much easier is that your is your favorite wow build of all time you you identify as a affliction

542
01:17:17,380 --> 01:17:27,880
warlock looks your warlock was awesome not anymore i don't cookie clicker gameplay yeah sorry let's

543
01:17:27,880 --> 01:17:56,090
just go okay doesn't work the bow is pretty good it seems uh seems good seems good seems good

544
01:17:57,050 --> 01:18:08,729
when was the last time you actually played affliction warlock i don't know like like 2000

545
01:18:08,729 --> 01:18:28,229
whatever year it was i can't relate to this wow talk i'm not a wower really this doesn't do that

546
01:18:28,229 --> 01:18:39,300
much damage at all are you getting the perfect i think so yeah yeah it doesn't look like it is

547
01:18:39,939 --> 01:18:58,359
i mean it like pierces targets that seems really good i think if you do perfect in a row it's better

548
01:18:59,699 --> 01:19:09,939
oh that sounds perfect times five all right i gotta be good is this the stream he said he was

549
01:19:09,939 --> 01:19:17,979
gonna do where he's gonna ditch stir and play breath of the wild um i didn't have a plan to do

550
01:19:17,979 --> 01:19:34,470
that precision or power power i can't remember what power did i want to get it watch out watch

551
01:19:34,470 --> 01:19:44,970
out there pal damage plus three holy what they're just handing those out

552
01:19:59,399 --> 01:20:05,880
look at us not taking any damage we did all right yeah we did pretty good already at the mini boss

553
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:16,390
i mean i take i took a few hits but sorry nah we're very distracted nah dude we're good

554
01:20:17,270 --> 01:20:29,260

555
01:20:29,260 --> 01:20:32,779
that last one because i was behind the guy shooting the laser i just thought about it again

556
01:20:46,649 --> 01:21:02,979
that was a plus 15 perfects in a row epic epic yeah eat up why did i fucking laugh at that

557
01:21:04,100 --> 01:21:13,380
what i don't know it's just like weird how you said it i don't it was i don't know yeah man eat up

559
01:21:21,770 --> 01:21:32,010

560
01:21:32,010 --> 01:21:39,420
have 150 gold or more gain bonus move speed and crit i think i can anybody confirm is the perfect

561
01:21:39,420 --> 01:21:48,729
a guaranteed crit or no it's probably not yeah press tab and like hover over the bow and read

562
01:21:48,729 --> 01:22:05,369
it i want to buy stuff though uh this thing sounds kind of good all right now i gotta work on crit

563
01:22:06,619 --> 01:22:13,109
all right can you please say happy birthday to me otherwise i won't just like the sims

564
01:22:13,909 --> 01:22:17,270
somebody said they if i don't say happy birthday they won't it won't happen or something was it

565
01:22:18,069 --> 01:22:38,489

567
01:22:54,789 --> 01:23:04,899
you know it happens to the best of us skills selector yeah you get that second skill you start

568
01:23:04,899 --> 01:23:38,060
popping off oh it's i you identify just like the third of those we found uh blast bomb or

569
01:23:38,060 --> 01:23:42,300
oh night night's charges night night's charge nice charge every time nice charge yeah why would i

570
01:23:42,300 --> 01:23:49,659
have picked up night's charge i'm i'm using a bow because uh you're invulnerable while you do it and

571
01:23:49,659 --> 01:23:57,819
it stuns everything so you could dash away from things kind of like i'll try this oh that's what

572
01:23:57,819 --> 01:24:02,710
i've been using pretty good not bad pretty good yeah it seems like you've been having a ball with

573
01:24:03,510 --> 01:24:14,039
yeah absolute ball when is star going to play five nights at freddy's wait while stir plays

574
01:24:14,039 --> 01:24:22,699
five nights at freddy's can we watch the emoji movie um no that answers the point is to watch

575
01:24:22,699 --> 01:24:28,729
the point is to watch me play five nights at freddy's i don't know why that's the point but

576
01:24:28,729 --> 01:24:45,510
that is what the point is that's what that's what he decided he wanted i can't believe you've never

577
01:24:45,510 --> 01:24:52,970
played five nights not once ever i feel like that's so i don't know how you avoided that

578
01:24:53,050 --> 01:24:58,170
being a youtuber back in 2012 how did you even avoid not playing it that's like saying you've

579
01:24:58,170 --> 01:25:06,739
never played minecraft before minecraft's an actual game yeah but i but but you know what i'm

580
01:25:06,739 --> 01:25:14,600
saying though how did you avoid it but i just didn't do it i just i just played what i wanted

581
01:25:14,600 --> 01:25:37,430
to play you know what i mean it's 10 hp dude your your health is getting up there man oh there's a

582
01:25:37,430 --> 01:25:41,029
game that i i want to stream it looks i don't know why i just got reminded of it looks really

583
01:25:41,029 --> 01:25:47,670
interesting it came out like a golem game yeah brog this is game coming out did you play as

584
01:25:47,670 --> 01:25:52,470
golem from lord of the rings and you crawl you don't remember that woman i said that one

585
01:25:52,470 --> 01:26:00,649
before i said that i remember when you said that uh have you heard him do you hear that that was

586
01:26:00,649 --> 01:26:13,130
weird did anybody hear that i i didn't hear it did you hear like the no i didn't does anybody

587
01:26:13,130 --> 01:26:19,189
so when you're talking sometimes do you sometimes and people don't ever kind of

588
01:26:19,189 --> 01:26:23,829
notice that you do it maybe sometimes people hear you do it but do you ever while you're talking

589
01:26:23,829 --> 01:26:29,960
game you wanted to play just listen when you talk sometimes do you go like this like blah blah blah

590
01:26:30,840 --> 01:26:40,010
i know that wasn't the game uh did you do that you fucked me up okay do you ever talk and

591
01:26:40,010 --> 01:26:47,020
sometimes you just go like like you just like yeah and then uh and and so i have to do

592
01:26:48,810 --> 01:26:53,770
i feel like that happens to way more of us than will care to admit i what is the question i'm

593
01:26:53,770 --> 01:26:58,010
confused what's the question do you sometimes have like air squeak come out of your throat

594
01:26:58,010 --> 01:27:08,420
sometimes while you are talking i guess like have you ever noticed that you go like yeah i

595
01:27:08,420 --> 01:27:12,659
my voice cracked pretty bad the other day no no not a voice crack this is just like air escaping

596
01:27:12,659 --> 01:27:20,939
in the middle of your sentence just like i think that's kind of the same no a true voice crack is

597
01:27:20,939 --> 01:27:32,069
like and i no no no i'm talking about you're like yeah and uh i also went to the store i can't hear

604
01:29:34,409 --> 01:29:40,810
i didn't need to i i've got potato chip grease all over my controller that's what's going on

605
01:29:43,689 --> 01:29:53,319
okay oh you said ayaya apologize for saying ayaya that's what they're saying i said what's wrong

606
01:29:53,319 --> 01:30:07,140
with you i'm i'm just relaying what 500 000 people just said i have a question for you sir

607
01:30:07,140 --> 01:30:12,260
yeah i have a question yeah it always starts like that i got a question for you hey listen

608
01:30:12,260 --> 01:30:17,460
man i got a question for you okay and i'm gonna answer this question like it's it's a job interview

609
01:30:17,460 --> 01:30:27,430
okay how long realistically speaking if you and i both sat here and in a high pitch voice said

610
01:30:27,430 --> 01:30:32,970
ayaya over and over again how long would it take for us to lose 90 percent of reviewers they're

611
01:30:32,970 --> 01:30:42,359
here be realistic i think like most people would stay yeah for a while to be like how long

612
01:30:43,159 --> 01:30:51,260
we probably go it's really happening i think it would go up yeah like at a certain point like

613
01:30:51,260 --> 01:30:55,500
an hour and someone will make like a post on like twitter like dude they're still doing the ayaya

614
01:30:55,500 --> 01:31:02,810
and like more people show up true especially if we came up with like a good reason for why we were

615
01:31:02,810 --> 01:31:08,489
doing it like we're doing this to protest the war in vietnam come send our troops home

616
01:31:09,750 --> 01:31:19,699
ayaya do ayaya for charity

617
01:31:30,789 --> 01:31:37,539
it's because there's something wrong with you um what's you're just gonna say dragon ball z

618
01:31:37,539 --> 01:31:42,899
what's your favorite anime we're talking about cartoons now we're gonna talk about adult animated

619
01:31:42,899 --> 01:31:49,060
cartoons from japan i can tell you that because i have seen quite a few

620
01:31:50,020 --> 01:31:57,779
uh it is not what everybody in here thinks it is my favorite okay so let me say

621
01:32:01,449 --> 01:32:12,100
okay i really do genuinely love the entire concept and i'm a big i'm a big concept guy right oh this

622
01:32:12,100 --> 01:32:19,380
guy i don't i don't really care about um i just love like just i want to interrupt i love

623
01:32:20,500 --> 01:32:23,859
that was the first time i've really done it but i asked you a question and then i watched your

624
01:32:23,859 --> 01:32:31,500
gameplay and i just fucking i loved it how quickly it degraded you were just like charging arrows and

625
01:32:31,500 --> 01:32:42,500
shooting at like walls i was yeah anyway so back back on track favorite anime this the concept of

626
01:32:42,500 --> 01:32:46,659
this series and we're talking that this could be uh most

627
01:32:57,939 --> 01:33:02,819
so good i'm just giving hey do you ever think that if you have like do you ever think that

628
01:33:02,819 --> 01:33:07,539
you have a dog right yes i don't know why i just thought of this but like do you ever think that

629
01:33:07,539 --> 01:33:13,859
like your dog is usually if they're over the age of 10 they're like 60 you ever think that it's

630
01:33:13,859 --> 01:33:18,020
like funny that there's like some 70 year old just 70 year old dude just lying on your couch

636
01:34:07,109 --> 01:34:14,420
better one punch man yeah people keep saying that but um i gotta get i gotta okay the concept of

637
01:34:14,420 --> 01:34:22,390
one punch man the entire series it's that's a really interesting series is well i don't spoil

638
01:34:22,390 --> 01:34:26,550
anything but what that that's a concept that i find very interesting because i need to see

639
01:34:26,550 --> 01:34:30,630
where they're going with it like i need to know where they're going with that because you know

640
01:34:30,630 --> 01:34:37,369
it's gonna something has to happen right it's an amazing concept uh something something does have

641
01:34:37,369 --> 01:34:42,569
to happen in the show well but i mean something it makes you think about like wait what's going

642
01:34:42,569 --> 01:34:52,260
on here what the heck's happening here i feel you music um when when he goes in for a punch

643
01:34:52,899 --> 01:34:57,939
when satama goes for a punch and they play that fucking song that like

644
01:35:06,060 --> 01:35:13,140
oh man just like look he's gonna do it he's gonna do it he's gonna do it and you know it's gonna

645
01:35:13,140 --> 01:35:19,380
happen and you know it's you know what's gonna happen and then he does it and he does it and

646
01:35:19,380 --> 01:35:28,420
then the thing he won and then there was one punch so i am just i need to know what's going

647
01:35:28,420 --> 01:35:37,029
on there that's why i like that show but now that you know what's going on there i don't that change

660
01:36:58,859 --> 01:37:19,479
i just i enjoyed the show man okay i enjoyed the television show okay somebody said stop him

661
01:37:20,119 --> 01:37:28,300
what do you mean do you guys know that humans like are romantically intertwined on the regular

662
01:37:29,100 --> 01:37:34,699
like it's normal for a man and a woman or whoever wants to like kiss whoever is like totally that

663
01:37:34,699 --> 01:37:45,189
happens all the time i'm seeing all these like cat leaning memes what is this cat like leaning

664
01:37:45,189 --> 01:38:13,289
thing oh fuck i'm gonna die chat your mom and your dad kissed shut up passionately your mom

665
01:38:13,289 --> 01:38:32,260
and your dad kissed passionately and some someone's mom could be raven and someone's mom or dad could

666
01:38:32,260 --> 01:38:51,319
be beast boy what's wrong with that breaking hearts what you ready to fight the boss yeah

667
01:38:53,430 --> 01:38:58,100
don't die or if you're gonna die it's a good room to do it because you you wake up afterwards

668
01:38:59,590 --> 01:39:20,789
but you haven't fought this boss before so you're gonna watch out for his ice attacks all right which

669
01:39:20,789 --> 01:39:25,909
one of the teen titans would you want to be what i want to be like if like oh what what teen titan

670
01:39:26,310 --> 01:39:42,460
let's just say you took one of those quizzes oh man um i'd want to be raven is it is it

671
01:39:42,460 --> 01:39:50,250
cliche and lame to say robin kind of i i i was thinking that and i was thinking you were going

672
01:39:50,250 --> 01:39:55,770
to say that because robin's superpower is having social control over everyone and that seems like

673
01:39:55,770 --> 01:39:59,850
the thing that you'd be into it's just just like any anyone says some shit you just shut it down

674
01:40:00,729 --> 01:40:08,970
well i was gonna say because i like nightwing but okay well i guess we'll take that what do you like

675
01:40:08,970 --> 01:40:17,130
about nightwing what's not that like about nightwing i got big got big shoes to fill you know

676
01:40:17,130 --> 01:40:23,689
that's a lot of pressure um you know batman's what essentially is this uh you know sidekick right

677
01:40:23,689 --> 01:40:29,449
and then all of you know wants to be that's a lot of pressure i like the idea of you know he lives

678
01:40:29,449 --> 01:40:46,199
up to it okay you buying anything he also people saying he's got a huge ass nightwing he i honestly

679
01:40:46,199 --> 01:40:50,600
have never really thought about it but to like recollect the trailers that had nightwing in it

680
01:40:51,159 --> 01:41:00,710
he did have a big ass yeah i got something in common with nightwing because it's huge

681
01:41:03,560 --> 01:41:17,829
yeah yeah you're not wrong the snowball was all right try this are we good what was the

682
01:41:17,829 --> 01:41:23,430
quote what were we oh what teen titan you would want to be yeah you said x-men was one of your

683
01:41:23,430 --> 01:41:35,140
favorite shows so which x-men are you um i would say nightcrawler because of the x-men arcade game

684
01:41:35,140 --> 01:41:41,699
my favorite character yeah i'm like nightcrawler i know if it wasn't nightcrawler then it would

685
01:41:41,699 --> 01:41:48,649
probably be either cyclops or probably cyclops or gambit oh beast no beast beast is an easy answer

686
01:41:49,210 --> 01:41:59,689
i like beast what about him i just want to be smart incredibly intelligent he's got brain he's

687
01:41:59,689 --> 01:42:10,729
got uh he's got physical ability he's he's got a problem solving he's reasonable i think that's

688
01:42:10,729 --> 01:42:26,010
he's got leadership written all over but i was saying i don't know what i i i don't i just i

689
01:42:26,010 --> 01:42:32,020
don't know what i wonder what i would why have been hanging out with me way too much i have fun

690
01:42:32,020 --> 01:42:42,119
i'm getting germ uphill my heart for some reason again is telling me that it would be cool to be

691
01:42:42,119 --> 01:42:48,500
dark phoenix and just end the world like like if the world's gotta end wouldn't it be cool if

692
01:42:48,500 --> 01:42:56,819
he's like i did it i mean kind of i mean i look up in the sky and i just see you up there floating

693
01:42:56,819 --> 01:43:01,220
you know what my like least favorite superhero trope is i've been thinking a lot about lately

694
01:43:01,220 --> 01:43:04,420
i don't know why it like keeps coming up and i keep thinking about it there's always the one

695
01:43:04,420 --> 01:43:11,939
hero who has an awesome ability and then does the like it's my burden to have this power i didn't

696
01:43:11,939 --> 01:43:16,579
ask for this oh my god i don't want to have this strength and they have like the best

697
01:43:16,579 --> 01:43:22,420
fucking power in the whole show but they're like not happy about it so wasn't it like uh not uh

698
01:43:23,220 --> 01:43:30,170
the one who touched people was gene gray or just like man i'm so sick of being able to have any

699
01:43:30,170 --> 01:43:38,899
superpower i want at any time make it go away rogue it was rogue yeah oh okay i was like what's he

700
01:43:38,899 --> 01:43:45,300
talking about i was like what what what x-men character just touches people yeah rogue i'm not

701
01:43:45,300 --> 01:43:53,220
just oh no no okay weird you're the one being weird okay no i'm saying i was i'm genuinely

702
01:43:53,220 --> 01:44:03,829
trying to figure out who like their power is they like they go like this i'm dead unfortunate

703
01:44:04,550 --> 01:44:08,470
how do you have 70 how we've been talking this whole time how do you have 72 health

704
01:44:09,430 --> 01:44:14,069
uh because instead of taking the max health perk i took the heal five after every room

705
01:44:14,069 --> 01:44:20,869
because that sounded really by the way rogues power is not touching people power is absorption

706
01:44:22,390 --> 01:44:32,739
absorption stupid idiot sorry i'm i'm sorry i got really i feel like i'm sorry no i i got i just got

707
01:44:32,739 --> 01:44:37,060
every time i have an opinion your whole you want to talk about your community your community dog

708
01:44:37,060 --> 01:44:42,979
piles on me that was uncalled for i'm you're encouraging it and i don't know if i feel welcome

709
01:44:42,979 --> 01:44:49,140
here yeah i just like because it's got really i want to see beast boy and raisin together

710
01:44:49,140 --> 01:45:16,899
doesn't mean i'm weird i'm just gonna keep powering up bring me back bring i have okay

711
01:45:16,899 --> 01:45:31,930
okay uh but rogue's power is absorption okay i believe you remember why are you so toxic

712
01:45:33,460 --> 01:45:40,409
every single thing that sir and i are doing right now is all for real and i mean everything

713
01:45:40,409 --> 01:45:53,029
i'm saying about it no it's the fucked up thing about you is that you're what you're actually

714
01:45:53,029 --> 01:46:01,590
thinking is worse than what you're saying you still haven't killed the mini boss yet i know

715
01:46:02,310 --> 01:46:08,409
i've been waiting for at least two or three minutes maybe you should have died yeah that's

716
01:46:10,500 --> 01:46:15,699
okay okay here you got it you got it you got it you got it that's very loud that's very loud

717
01:46:20,229 --> 01:46:30,539
he's such a meanie your internal model monologue okay but if you had to be an x-men which which

718
01:46:30,539 --> 01:46:37,720
person are you picking for explicitly their power like you wanted that power cyclops what the fuck

719
01:46:37,720 --> 01:46:43,479
would you want to be cyclops cyclops's power is fucking amazing i've already had what you use it

720
01:46:43,479 --> 01:46:51,699
for what would you use any x-men power for there too what do you mean all x-men powers are about

721
01:46:51,699 --> 01:46:57,539
like fucking like killing like attacking people what power exists in the x-men universe mystique

722
01:46:57,539 --> 01:47:01,619
mystique just transform into like any person so i could trick you to finally love me

723
01:47:04,779 --> 01:47:09,100
that's not like fighting there's some there's someone who has like healing powers as well like

724
01:47:09,100 --> 01:47:13,020
they put their hands on someone they just like oh they're healed and you're like no i want to be

725
01:47:13,020 --> 01:47:20,140

728
01:47:57,880 --> 01:48:04,779
oh that was the there's no correct answer it's just what would you actually do with cyclops's

729
01:48:04,779 --> 01:48:11,260
power is the question i don't know the only thing it can do is kill people you look at

730
01:48:11,260 --> 01:48:19,420
yeah how often do you want to do that why why why are you okay are we in the x-men universe or are

731
01:48:19,420 --> 01:48:24,539
we just like in my living room we're in your living room okay then oh i don't what do i need a

746
01:50:20,439 --> 01:50:30,090
this is so funny you try to stir you have never worse have you never stood in the mirror like this

747
01:50:32,409 --> 01:50:35,689
i gotta see what you're doing you never stood in the mirror like this and been like

748
01:50:35,689 --> 01:50:41,880
leave everything to me you've never done that before you never start have been like leave

749
01:50:41,880 --> 01:50:47,880
everything to these citizens you've never done that that's that's the saddest thing you've ever

750
01:50:47,880 --> 01:50:54,550
said that not only do you do that but you're so shocked another human being wouldn't stand in

751
01:50:54,550 --> 01:51:03,560
the mirror and do that i do i do it naked in the mirror so i do it naked in the mirror you're

752
01:51:03,560 --> 01:51:07,640
gonna be mad at me for that too i do it naked in the mirror uh after getting out of the shower

753
01:51:07,640 --> 01:51:15,640
every morning i said look at the mirror there's nothing wrong with that i mean if you got the

754
01:51:15,640 --> 01:51:30,810
body for it and honey i know you do okay you haven't played this data before what would your

755
01:51:30,810 --> 01:51:37,420
power be again mr perfect okay well if i'm the only one in the world that has a power i can't

756
01:51:37,420 --> 01:51:45,350
pick rogue rogue is the obvious because you just get literally every power um uh i don't know

757
01:51:45,350 --> 01:51:50,390
wolverine gets like that wolverine's another one he gets to live forever as like the strongest dude

758
01:51:50,390 --> 01:51:56,789
in the fucking world he's like i'm so i just wish i would die man i'm so bored of being the strongest

759
01:51:57,350 --> 01:52:00,869
guy who lives forever it doesn't have to worry about disease or anything

760
01:52:02,310 --> 01:52:08,539
everyone who's strong is fucking they just they hate it you just don't like i don't know wolverine

761
01:52:08,539 --> 01:52:15,420
or or charles xavier you just gave me shit for saying leave everything to me in the mirror

762
01:52:15,899 --> 01:52:22,600
but you are psycho analyzing every x-men character i'm just bringing up the trope that i don't like

763
01:52:22,600 --> 01:52:27,000
where everyone who is strong hates that they are strong and it's a burden on them like everyone

764
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:33,319
else doesn't have like real problems wolverine's problem is that he is immune to everything and he

765
01:52:33,319 --> 01:52:41,689
hates it um that's it's the total opposite of what you're doing where you go in the mirror leave it

766
01:52:41,689 --> 01:52:46,489
to me citizens wolverine's version of that is going in the mirror and saying i could save i could

767
01:52:46,489 --> 01:52:59,539
save them but i'm sad about it you've definitely done that in the mirror before i mean like i just

768
01:52:59,539 --> 01:53:06,539
but hey you added extra context though well wait what was the extra context am i not allowed to

769
01:53:06,539 --> 01:53:12,460
elaborate and continue the conversation all right so here's my point so when you ask somebody hey

770
01:53:12,460 --> 01:53:17,020
what would your what would your what would you have for a superpower and the person just goes

771
01:53:17,020 --> 01:53:20,220
like they're like i don't know they're eating a sandwich like laser eyes i guess i don't know

772
01:53:20,779 --> 01:53:24,060
monster you're a monster you're a monster you're a monster weird

773
01:53:25,739 --> 01:53:33,319
the first thing that comes to your mind being laser eyes is weird i thought a superman has a

774
01:53:33,319 --> 01:53:39,239
cyclops it's just like an easy like i guess i don't know flight laser eyes no flight would be normal

775
01:53:39,239 --> 01:53:44,359
flight oh everyone wants to fly not everyone wants to and especially specifically cyclops

776
01:53:44,359 --> 01:53:50,649
right can't control it and just does it he has special glasses do you want to wear special

777
01:53:50,649 --> 01:53:54,649
glasses the rest of your life and if you ever take them off you like kill all of your loved

778
01:53:54,649 --> 01:54:03,289
ones you just wake up in the morning and you're just like ah all right it's gonna be a good day

779
01:54:03,289 --> 01:54:10,710
today you just blow a hole in your ceiling through it yeah oh my oh sorry my glasses came off honey

780
01:54:10,710 --> 01:54:20,489
are you still there what was your power what was it i forget what it was i was all being it was

781
01:54:20,489 --> 01:54:25,369
being able to change it was you wanted to change into like other people dude i would take power

782
01:54:25,449 --> 01:54:32,890
mystique would be good xavier would be good wolverine would be good why wouldn't you xavier

783
01:54:35,819 --> 01:54:40,300
charles xavier i feel like that would be too much i don't know if i want that just to like

784
01:54:40,300 --> 01:54:45,659
tap into the room and like nsa anyone in the world and that and what and wait whoa

785
01:54:47,260 --> 01:54:55,100
me wanting laser eyes is crazy but you wanting to tap into everybody's brain is completely

786
01:54:55,100 --> 01:55:01,399
normal human behavior very interesting you ever fantasize about like if you had the power to like

787
01:55:01,399 --> 01:55:16,680
stop time you would just use it to be better at video games yeah yeah i do yeah that's bad

788
01:55:17,479 --> 01:55:23,460
i would i would just join a speedrun category and just and just have a world record that's

789
01:55:23,460 --> 01:55:33,180
unbeatable you'd be a fucking track mania player all right let's let's let's gravitate

790
01:55:33,180 --> 01:55:44,899
it to a more normal conversation do you have one yeah stir one germa zero um at this point

791
01:55:44,899 --> 01:55:51,220
it's probably like stir 12 germa like eight or so we've been having a lot of conversations

792
01:55:51,220 --> 01:56:01,819
who's keeping who's keeping track who's scoring our conversation yeah yeah cut that shit up

793
01:56:02,619 --> 01:56:13,529
score would be funny though what are you guys scoring this what's the score what are you guys

794
01:56:13,529 --> 01:56:26,300
scoring this right now this is a boxing match which means to us too biased one oh stir like

795
01:56:26,300 --> 01:56:32,710
they just joined the stream well that's what i'm saying they were like one one bit yeah you're

796
01:56:32,710 --> 01:56:47,720
both basically dead at this point stir is 15 and you're at a two no way no way who is the guy that

797
01:56:47,720 --> 01:56:52,760
could run at super speed like the but not the flash the the x-men version quicksilver who does

798
01:56:52,840 --> 01:56:59,300
nothing in every movie i would be quicksilver but i'd do something in the movie people would

799
01:56:59,300 --> 01:57:04,659
argue that quicksilver is parts in those movies were the only good parts of those movies exactly

800
01:57:04,659 --> 01:57:32,710
and i would be those parts oh shit holy shit i didn't even tell you about the game i know

and do that one do that one dude it has to be either or right yeah you can swap it i already

895
02:15:00,819 --> 02:15:05,539
put a lot of points in this one so you can respect everything just press the e or respect oh that's

896
02:15:05,539 --> 02:15:23,300
cool it doesn't cost anything cool five hp after completing a room that actually is kind of i feel

897
02:15:23,300 --> 02:15:32,539
like you need it i need it that's how the rogue lights are so what about this money one game 50

898
02:15:32,539 --> 02:15:44,869
gold when entering a world boy no i want more at the beginning this is not bad you should take

899
02:15:44,869 --> 02:15:54,119
this one you get the damage bonus above 75 hp i think the the earn power would be more consistent

900
02:15:54,840 --> 02:16:08,390
stacks i don't know if you know this but my mind is ascendant germa you know uh you know if i

901
02:16:08,390 --> 02:16:13,510
didn't get to choose which x-men i was you just got you just got put which one you actually are

902
02:16:14,149 --> 02:16:20,949
i would be modock because i have such a gigantic brain and i am i am unstoppable my brain's so big

903
02:16:20,949 --> 02:16:28,859
i can shoot lasers out of it right but i can't shoot lasers out of my eyes well your eyes are

904
02:16:28,859 --> 02:16:44,709
always doing it modock is powerful enough to know when to use lasers okay let's see how this is so

905
02:16:44,709 --> 02:16:58,700
you have to charge it the whole way i actually i feel like i like this i feel like i'm going to

906
02:16:58,700 --> 02:17:07,850
only like the sword there's a hammer and a throwing weapon all right what x-men would i be really what

907
02:17:07,850 --> 02:17:14,329
x-men would i be or no forget that what super what superhero super doesn't matter what would i be

914
02:18:32,100 --> 02:18:39,059
smartest people you can mold into any shape and conform to anything he needs and he gets to be

915
02:18:39,059 --> 02:18:50,469
the leader which i know you like gets to shut any shit down let's go you ready i would probably be

916
02:18:50,469 --> 02:19:11,000
spongebob that's a good hero choice jim carries the mask that also works except the mask is always on

917
02:19:12,520 --> 02:19:29,610
it never comes off you'd be captain underpants that's a good hero no i doubt it i doubt it

918
02:19:30,409 --> 02:19:49,299
i'm seeing a lot of trues for captain underpants i disagree i would be anubis the egyptian god

919
02:19:50,360 --> 02:20:11,020
of death what i'd be the joker this guy wants laser eyes and to be the the egyptian god of

920
02:20:11,020 --> 02:20:18,340
death and judge everyone who dies forever that's fucked up and you're missing standing in the mirror

921
02:20:20,739 --> 02:20:37,420
and monologuing well what if you you go to you go to monologue legendary relic but my hp is never

922
02:20:37,420 --> 02:21:05,059
gonna fall below 10 i'll take it haha you don't get it anubis has the laser eye in smite yeah sure

923
02:21:05,059 --> 02:21:12,889
it does that's so stupid he really i kind of assumed you were thinking of anubis as well

924
02:21:13,690 --> 02:21:17,129
because you would want to like shoot your cocoon at someone and then talk to them for 10 minutes

925
02:21:17,770 --> 02:21:26,600
well let me explain to you baddies what you've done wrong here

926
02:21:27,000 --> 02:21:39,340

929
02:22:26,059 --> 02:22:34,219
literally perfect let's this conversation is like nice and all i would hear you'd be we would both

930
02:22:34,219 --> 02:22:43,659
be the the in the ninja turtles the reporter girl we just we just talk about what people are doing

931
02:22:46,069 --> 02:22:53,590
uh now there's no way that i'm not michael angelo i'm sorry i've not i'm gonna have to argue that

932
02:22:54,309 --> 02:23:13,799
which one's michael angelo like the smart one whoa man if you don't pick up immediately who i'm

933
02:23:13,799 --> 02:23:20,180
talking about you've never ever ever orange one orange one orange one orange one that guy goes

934
02:23:20,180 --> 02:23:30,520
that guy goes crazy you know actually why why i find uh nunchucks to be a really real you just

935
02:23:30,520 --> 02:23:37,530
laugh at me i saw a nunchuck meme like a week ago i totally agree with it just made me think

936
02:23:37,530 --> 02:23:45,209
about it nunchucks is such a they're they're such an unbelievable it's like a dance it's like a

937
02:23:45,690 --> 02:23:55,690
dance it takes a ton of skill to use it it's just like so for no benefit i mean i think that

938
02:23:56,489 --> 02:24:03,209
what would you use the the meme was about how just a stick is better than a nunchuck

939
02:24:05,239 --> 02:24:09,879
yeah but there's deception with a nunchuck let's understand is is there that's the whole point

940
02:24:09,879 --> 02:24:16,920
because it's like boom right in the jaw okay but like but you're fighting someone who has like a

941
02:24:16,920 --> 02:24:21,639
real weapon like a spear they haven't trained for like 10 years to learn how to use the spear

942
02:24:21,639 --> 02:24:27,940
and they just like poke you once if a spear is overpowered everybody knows that so you're

943
02:24:27,940 --> 02:24:34,229
you're good enough that you don't need to use a spear but spear is spear is always going to be

944
02:24:34,229 --> 02:24:47,209
the best weapon throw at history that's accurate right yeah spear does everything okay so we're

945
02:24:47,209 --> 02:24:51,049
no one's allowed to pick spear it's too strong yeah we're like in the middle of our picking

946
02:24:51,049 --> 02:24:57,079
ban phase and i banned spear okay cannot bring that to the battle what would make you want to use

947
02:24:57,719 --> 02:25:08,250
nunchucks over like a flail which is just nunchucks but with a threatening part have you have you seen

948
02:25:08,250 --> 02:25:13,719
what some people can do with nunchucks you almost can't even see them they're like helicopters

949
02:25:15,500 --> 02:25:21,750
okay but then like it okay putting myself in i'm in the combat situation you've got your nunchucks

950
02:25:21,750 --> 02:25:26,709
and you're a master we're just assuming you're a master i've had a flail and i know how to use

951
02:25:26,709 --> 02:25:31,540
it because i've i just i've never used one but it's like a flail how could you not use it

952
02:25:31,540 --> 02:25:36,020
i think i win that fight if i just like take the hits and flail you one time

953
02:25:36,020 --> 02:25:41,479
okay but you're also missing the the potential comedy of that weapon where you do the whoa whoa

02:28:11,299 --> 02:28:19,129
like a nice slice of pizza thank you that's a lot better than a ham sandwich with mustard on the

971

bottom i know i was just being mean for no reason i was just being rude all right well no now you'd

1016
02:34:47,270 --> 02:35:11,420

1017
02:35:11,420 --> 02:35:14,860
weren't paying attention because i asked you a question and i picked up two of the crit gems

1018
02:35:14,860 --> 02:35:19,260
which is why i gave you two of the health gems oh i see so so if we get crit again let me get

1019
02:35:19,260 --> 02:35:24,459
the crit stuff i will make sense let me in there and i'm gonna i'm gonna keep taking like crit

1020
02:35:24,459 --> 02:35:37,370
lightning oh oh i mean poison stacks one poison stacks one does this do these actually stack

1021
02:35:37,370 --> 02:35:42,309
though uh it does say stack so i would have to assume it's stacked you have to assume that right

1022
02:35:42,309 --> 02:35:43,350
you have to assume it

1023
02:35:54,090 --> 02:35:59,370
if you could pick any element that became alive and could be your friend what would it be any

1024
02:35:59,370 --> 02:36:09,959
element like are you saying like a like an ember fire head element would be your friend i mean like

1025
02:36:09,959 --> 02:36:14,840
like helium like hydrogen oh yeah okay i'm thinking fantasy

1026
02:36:15,399 --> 02:36:25,659
okay what kind of golem would i like to have i i kind of i just wanted to confuse you for a moment

1027
02:36:25,659 --> 02:36:33,399
i'm sorry i'm pretty confused especially when your example is helium could helium come alive

1028
02:36:33,399 --> 02:36:40,489
and be my friend i feel like that is not even one of the like strangest things we've talked

1029
02:36:40,489 --> 02:36:46,739
about today i think it is it might be but is it you don't want this you want some skill damage

1030
02:36:47,219 --> 02:36:58,819
uh i'll take it uh gold is the most precious of metals oh yeah so you could you could melt

1031
02:36:58,819 --> 02:37:15,379
your friend down and sell it yeah monster who needs friends when you've got money am i right

1032
02:37:34,840 --> 02:37:42,040
this is disney villain plot you could you have the power to turn people into gold

1033
02:37:42,760 --> 02:38:05,420
but then they have to be your friend dude we are so powerful we're actually doing pretty good

1034
02:38:05,579 --> 02:38:15,670

1035
02:38:15,670 --> 02:38:22,969
us this is the first stream in a long time i think we're just usually weird i think we're just

1036
02:38:22,969 --> 02:38:29,530
messing around i've been i've been very honest open and vulnerable tonight yeah

1037
02:38:35,030 --> 02:38:46,600
messing around just a little bit of a joke you know you guys are fun to watch hey cool we're glad

1038
02:38:57,209 --> 02:39:01,049
uh i do you want to be faster i feel like i've gotten like three of these

1039
02:39:01,049 --> 02:39:09,799

1040
02:39:09,799 --> 02:39:26,659
with these i don't think i need to change them dude that room we just annihilated them we were in

1041
02:39:26,659 --> 02:39:32,579
that room for like 30 milliseconds i was gonna say you know seconds are too long um they didn't

1042
02:39:32,579 --> 02:39:37,450
give me the crit gem i was gonna say can you reroll no there was a there was like a perk for

1043
02:39:37,450 --> 02:39:45,829
that but i don't think i took it what's your guy's favorite chips i actually have the answer to this

1044
02:39:45,829 --> 02:39:56,950
if anybody wants to know it a lot of you already know i've got i've got chip related trauma no

1045
02:39:56,950 --> 02:40:03,670
so there's another story did you did your brother like okay when i was really young again

1046
02:40:03,670 --> 02:40:10,200
when i was really young my brother he's older and his friend they're older i'm the young i'm

1047
02:40:10,200 --> 02:40:17,159
the younger brother he made a son chip baseball and he no he did one of the my brother's friend

1048
02:40:17,159 --> 02:40:20,920
was like man i could really go for some chips right now and i was super into it too and i was

1049
02:40:20,920 --> 02:40:25,319
like yeah i could go for some chips and then i found out like an hour later after this whole

1050
02:40:25,319 --> 02:40:31,159
like chip debacle that they weren't talking about chocolate chips and i felt very foolish

1051
02:40:33,620 --> 02:40:39,299
i mean that and that kind of ruined my life honestly i feel like you were i feel like you

1052
02:40:39,299 --> 02:40:43,379
were implying oh double you're gonna want to focus up for the phalanx throws

1053
02:40:45,459 --> 02:41:16,440
i won my fight we do more damage than i do you've taken all the damage items you've taken all the

1054
02:41:16,440 --> 02:41:21,559
damage gems oh okay now it's my fault that i'm doing more damage can you fucking eat this meat

1055
02:41:22,620 --> 02:41:32,260
uh okay so what is your favorite chip no um dude i don't i'm not really a chip guy at all

1056
02:41:35,500 --> 02:41:40,870
not really i mean it's got to go with something and then at that point it's more about what it's

1057
02:41:40,870 --> 02:41:46,219
going with than the actual chip you know it's like a delivery device and then i really care

1058
02:41:46,219 --> 02:42:01,430
anymore max relics oh shit i have to get rid of this uh can i even get rid of this

1059
02:42:06,260 --> 02:42:12,440
can i drop a relic because i just thought you farted i thought that was a huge fart

1060
02:42:12,440 --> 02:42:21,500
it's like why did you play that over the mic i thought that was the fart reverb sound oh i

1061
02:42:21,500 --> 02:42:28,739
misunderstood this one too i don't really want it shit i just i have i guess i'll take it it's

1062
02:42:28,739 --> 02:42:38,709
weird i if you can use that take it i apparently why couldn't i why couldn't you i fold relic

1063
02:42:38,709 --> 02:42:51,260
slots apparently how i don't know i only have i have two okay i have wait now i have four relics

1064
02:42:51,260 --> 02:42:57,420
i can't go down to the second slot you already have that relic oh like you can't have more than

1065
02:42:57,420 --> 02:43:11,030
one yeah oh i thought you could just kind of stack them so you're not a chip guy are you

1066
02:43:11,829 --> 02:43:18,309
any type of salty snack kind of what does that i mean like i i like chips but like i was thinking

1067
02:43:18,309 --> 02:43:21,909
it has to go with something so it's more about what it goes with like i'll have chips with cottage

1068
02:43:21,909 --> 02:43:28,309
cheese is you know like a consistent thing for me you know if you're in like a like nachos with

1069
02:43:28,309 --> 02:43:36,579
something that sounds cool do you do salt and pepper on cottage cheese no no but you that's

1070
02:43:37,219 --> 02:43:54,170
you would like it oh what are you going to cook for me

1071
02:43:55,379 --> 02:44:03,770
what do you want what do you like cooking what do you want i want what you like cooking salmon

1072
02:44:03,770 --> 02:44:07,290
every time every time someone's like oh i like cooking and i cook this all the time and then i

1073
02:44:07,290 --> 02:44:12,729
see them and i'm like hey you know cooking's cool i'll even help i'm not like asking to be like

1074
02:44:12,729 --> 02:44:19,819
served but like i like to see what people are into and what they're cooking good looking uh i like

1075
02:44:20,620 --> 02:44:26,379
you want the damage too you might as well take it what are you going to cook for me

1076
02:44:26,940 --> 02:44:32,459
i mean that's that's a very broad question i mean what do you what do you feel like today

1077
02:44:32,459 --> 02:44:40,059
i want what i want what you like okay so what what i want to experience you okay it's not about

1078
02:44:40,700 --> 02:44:48,329
so if i were to make food i don't know like pretty good pasta salad right now that's what i would

1079
02:44:48,329 --> 02:44:52,729

just that just actually gassed when you said that i know i'm aware like when i go to the grocery

1091
02:46:15,260 --> 02:46:19,260
store sometimes i like to buy the like they have like the pre-made like here you go like pre-made

1092
02:46:19,260 --> 02:46:25,139
package like ready to go like ham like the the pork that i left in my backpack yeah other room

1093
02:46:25,139 --> 02:46:31,860
we don't need to heal uh it's always like three dishes of pork and then the rest everything else

1094
02:46:31,860 --> 02:46:37,540
like a hundred options of salmon if i feel like they're just trying to get rid of this shit

1095
02:46:38,940 --> 02:46:44,139
like there's a warehouse somewhere with just like way too much salmon in it i mean it's it's probably

1096
02:46:44,139 --> 02:46:51,559
one of the most popular foods in in the world i would say i mean i don't know what the statistics

1097
02:46:51,559 --> 02:46:57,639
in the united states are salmon is very very very popular it's like a staple of a lot of people's

1098
02:46:59,159 --> 02:47:09,829
diets i think a lot fish uh cod salmon a haddock those are staples i feel like if you if you had to

1099
02:47:09,829 --> 02:47:22,579
have salmon would be like lowest on my list do you like like absolute bottom no no really um i

1100
02:47:22,579 --> 02:47:31,430
feel like i'd rather have tuna but okay what about tuna fish from the can that sounds disgusting

1101
02:47:31,430 --> 02:47:40,469
yeah i'll take the salmon no no no no no no no people just have such a bad opinion of salmon

1102
02:47:40,469 --> 02:47:47,270
out of the can and it's just you just gotta gotta trust me you just gotta hold your nose

1103
02:47:47,270 --> 02:47:57,290
no he's gotta you have to trust me all right everyone will be quiet watch out for his attack

1104
02:47:57,850 --> 02:48:15,260
he's gonna freeze you you're getting hit you're just standing still what do you

1105
02:48:16,940 --> 02:48:24,579
stop making me make jokes that aren't funny i would love it if you made funny jokes

1106
02:48:25,299 --> 02:49:12,790
like this this ain't on me he's just hitting he's landing them on me not you oh you got this

1107
02:49:22,020 --> 02:49:31,219
epic i will i will die on this hill doing a fish out of the can solid like you get get a good solid

1108
02:49:31,219 --> 02:49:36,819
albacore tuna and you're gonna take that you're gonna mix it obviously with mayo

1109
02:49:38,340 --> 02:49:41,540
interrupting your favorite fish though is your favorite fish salmon or tuna

1110
02:49:42,420 --> 02:49:49,139
it realistically is probably tuna it's probably tuna fish like all seafood like even like we're

1111
02:49:49,139 --> 02:49:57,979
talking like crab lobster i like crab i don't like lobster weirdly enough i actually don't really like

1112
02:49:57,979 --> 02:50:08,569
um lobster at all probably probably uh probably weird for this one but i think if i had to have

1113
02:50:08,569 --> 02:50:15,739
any seafood of all things it's calamari see now you lost me big time but yeah i don't know how you

1114
02:50:15,739 --> 02:50:22,299
will think that eating squid is fine but salmon is gross to you how doesn't make any sense it just

1115
02:50:22,299 --> 02:50:31,260
tastes weird how does it make any sense squid and has such a distinct odd flavor i i'm not

1116
02:50:31,260 --> 02:50:39,159
really it does salmon and if you they both seafood right but how do you like calamari but you don't

1117
02:50:39,159 --> 02:50:47,079
you hate salmon it's just it's salmon just tastes weird like sign me up for like almost any other

1118
02:50:47,079 --> 02:50:57,239
fish really that's really i think tuna fish and pretzels i know i've changed at least a few

1119
02:50:57,239 --> 02:51:06,760
people's lives here i just have my life was i was living a shallow existence i was germa streamed

1120
02:51:06,760 --> 02:51:14,760
he said because he said eat what what was it tuna fish so i'm talking canned tuna you take it out

1121
02:51:14,760 --> 02:51:18,760
of the container you mix it up like make a tuna like like as if you were gonna put it in like a

1122
02:51:18,760 --> 02:51:25,479
sandwich i'm talking tuna fish sandwich tuna fish you put mayo mix it up add whatever bullshit you

1123
02:51:25,479 --> 02:51:29,319
want to make it the way you want it but you no actually don't do that just do it normally

1124
02:51:29,319 --> 02:51:35,850
and take pretzel sticks pretzel cylinders wait i'm confused because i just had to throw out the

1125
02:51:35,850 --> 02:51:41,659
first half of the recipe i read the recipe and step five was throw out the first half okay

1126
02:51:42,379 --> 02:51:48,780
it's not drunk food it's not it's not high food it's not drunk food it's just good shit i'm telling

1127
02:51:48,780 --> 02:51:58,120
you a lot of people just write it off and they don't even give it a chance this one's probably

1128
02:51:58,120 --> 02:52:06,579
good something to do with the way the pretzels interact with the tuna fish i don't know what it

1129
02:52:06,579 --> 02:52:12,180
is there's gonna somebody that's in the science community please help someone who knows science

1130
02:52:12,260 --> 02:52:26,540
tell me why i like this food no i'm serious it's weird it changes completely i understand it's so

1131
02:52:26,540 --> 02:53:01,909
good exactly the combination is it's relentlessly good the salt no no it's it can't be it's the

1132
02:53:01,909 --> 02:53:12,840
molecular interaction between the salt the bread and the fish you must just like sodium whoa whoa

1133
02:53:13,000 --> 02:53:19,190
hold on a second check it out scientist in chat the pretzels contain an enzyme called

1134
02:53:19,190 --> 02:53:24,549
forazine that reacts with tuna proteins since they're long chain proteins they tend to spool

1135
02:53:24,549 --> 02:53:34,180
and it creates a stringy what i just didn't read i did i read something fucked up i didn't just

1136
02:53:34,180 --> 02:53:40,780
read something like fucked up right i i i don't know i don't know neither do i if we're gonna

1137
02:53:40,780 --> 02:53:52,299

03:01:06,780 --> 03:01:16,620
joke that's the worst thing is there anything worse in the whole universe um i don't know

1180
03:01:16,620 --> 03:01:23,579
maybe ordering pickup at a restaurant i always feel like i fuck up when i second guess everything

1181
03:01:23,579 --> 03:01:32,540
i just say what i feel like i screw up every time it's just like oh hey yeah what what can i

1182
03:01:32,540 --> 03:01:38,219
get you uh and are you wait wait wait wait you know the internet happened right you don't like

1183
03:01:38,219 --> 03:01:41,260
you don't no one orders pickup anymore on the phone what are you talking about

1184
03:01:42,329 --> 03:01:54,520
do you call the place i mean yeah not every single restaurant in the world

1185
03:01:54,520 --> 03:02:21,780
operates on like fucking uber what are you talking about yeah they do boomer yeah that was good this

1186
03:02:21,780 --> 03:02:27,379
is like this this is the equivalent of the airplane food kind of like no one like when

1187
03:02:27,379 --> 03:02:34,979
you call the place to order food who who does that who's relating to this how but do you order

1188
03:02:34,979 --> 03:02:42,260
every single time from like an app or a website i i haven't called a place to order since like

1189
03:02:45,979 --> 03:02:51,819
the 2001 or something i don't but here's the thing about ordering sometimes through those apps

1190
03:02:52,780 --> 03:02:57,420
it can get weird because sometimes get weird because sometimes it's just it's listed fucking

1191
03:02:57,420 --> 03:03:04,540
weirdly and it's like wait that's not that's listed kind of not correctly like it's like wait a minute

1192
03:03:04,540 --> 03:03:10,540
i have to check like five boxes but wait that's not how the thing's listed on the actual restaurant

1193
03:03:10,540 --> 03:03:20,010
it can be weird i i feel like i i i know exactly what i'm getting when i call they can be listed

1194
03:03:20,010 --> 03:03:24,010
bizarrely sometimes you don't even know what meat is in a sandwich for instance just like oh this

1195
03:03:24,010 --> 03:03:30,090
one's like a number three it's like wait what is that what's in it i don't know i need to i need

1196
03:03:30,090 --> 03:03:39,909
to know i need to find out what's in the number three can't you read oh yeah yeah are you gonna

1197
03:03:39,909 --> 03:03:54,520
make an offering yeah giving them 400 gold i actually gave it 250 and he gave me a broken jar

1198
03:03:55,860 --> 03:04:07,530
i got more help he gave me a useless a broken jar for 400 but no honestly though it a lot of

1199
03:04:07,530 --> 03:04:14,739
times i feel like i know exactly like oh so hey what what comes on that by the way oh this this

1200
03:04:14,739 --> 03:04:20,979
this and this okay good what i want uh i'm gonna take the l and just admit that one of my least

1201
03:04:20,979 --> 03:04:31,879
favorite things in life is being on the phone i actually don't mind it but i know what you mean

1202
03:04:31,879 --> 03:04:41,299
though like if i think i was saying not that long ago one of the greatest inventions ever

1203
03:04:41,299 --> 03:04:45,540
or like the greatest modern trends is that everything that you can order food is like

1204
03:04:45,540 --> 03:04:50,100
done through an app and you don't have to talk to someone like i'd give up so much technology

1205
03:04:51,059 --> 03:04:54,420
to never have to talk on the phone about the food i want you should eat this

1206
03:04:58,860 --> 03:05:04,219
i mean you're talking about convenience it's much more convenient for you to not have to do that

1207
03:05:04,219 --> 03:05:13,850
right i get it i feel the same way a lot of times right but i uh i have also used those apps before

1208
03:05:14,649 --> 03:05:21,209
and no fault of of the restaurant or even like the driver doesn't matter right no fault of anybody

1209
03:05:21,209 --> 03:05:28,329
it's just kind of wrong and you stuff doesn't come out right um i i much prefer being able to

1210
03:05:28,329 --> 03:05:32,809
know exactly like by somebody on the phone it's like telling me what i'm gonna be it's a it's

1211
03:05:32,809 --> 03:05:38,489
trust issues it's a trust issue here that you have focus up this is wait is this the guy

1228
03:09:58,780 --> 03:10:07,020
focus on dodging there we go all right buster you got this final phase is easy the you can

1229
03:10:07,020 --> 03:10:36,120
totally dodge the yellow beam even if you're standing behind him uh oh uh oh he's healing

1230
03:10:36,120 --> 03:10:56,010
one more hit you took all the damage you took all the damage shit oh damn i hate to see it oh i

1231
03:10:56,010 --> 03:11:10,340
couldn't even fucking hurt him man he still didn't beat my damage no because you picked up almost

1232
03:11:10,340 --> 03:11:18,149
every single damage gem in the game that sounds true that sounds totally true and definitely a

1233
03:11:18,149 --> 03:11:21,510
way to like get yourself out of this but now you're not forgiven for all of your sins

1234
03:11:22,549 --> 03:11:33,129
when you die god's gonna look upon your record look at this moment but i tried that's the part

1235
03:11:33,129 --> 03:11:57,530
that's sad hey watch it your relic selectors if you were oh oh wow no relic yeah i think relic

1236
03:11:57,530 --> 03:12:17,159
yeah six percent is that permanent if it is that's really good uh what is this new weapon

1237
03:12:18,889 --> 03:12:36,680
oh hammer man i actually like this i want to be hammer man i want to be hammer guy

1238
03:12:39,030 --> 03:12:43,909
how about we both be hammer guy do you think that you're powerful enough to wield it

1239
03:12:47,219 --> 03:12:54,120
maybe if i had one crit gem the whole game or one damage okay okay i'll bow down to you we

1240
03:12:54,120 --> 03:13:07,940
gotta go talk to this guy i'll use the bow what is that strange energy this game's fun i like it

1241
03:13:10,250 --> 03:13:26,489
yeah nice little buster beat him up so we are identifying these dude we seriously not give him

1242
03:13:26,489 --> 03:13:32,329
any ever because we had so many of these on our previous run oh my god we really didn't these are

1243
03:13:32,329 --> 03:13:37,770
now available on your journey oops that's a lot of new things i'm not i'm not gonna read them

1244
03:13:37,770 --> 03:13:40,409
i don't care we'll find them there's more

1245
03:13:45,860 --> 03:13:57,639
next next okay oh cool nice okay let me uh did you read the details of the hammer

1246
03:13:58,360 --> 03:14:06,409
i did so all of the attacks can be charged so you can go one two one two three

1247
03:14:07,049 --> 03:14:15,479
again they're all they're all different seems strong i'll try both i think bow looks bad but

1248
03:14:15,479 --> 03:14:22,600
i'm gonna use it i'm gonna i'm gonna be the bow guy i actually probably should use this okay so

1249
03:14:23,159 --> 03:14:34,549
okay like if i'm very realistic i probably should use this okay let's go then i'm hammer guy

1250
03:14:36,709 --> 03:14:40,870
me too all right what are you doing take the hammer we need to be the hammer bro no

1251
03:14:40,870 --> 03:14:46,579
i don't want to be the hammer brother i don't want to mirror match right now fine don't complain to

1252
03:14:46,579 --> 03:14:51,540
me when there's no funny material that we can do like a super mario thing together god damn it

1253
03:14:51,540 --> 03:15:13,270

1254
03:15:13,270 --> 03:15:19,879
brother you know what i'm saying like do you think we could go to a court and i could become your

1255
03:15:19,879 --> 03:15:36,520
brother uh probably yeah i think yeah what's this huh oh he's sexy looks like the fucking the

1256
03:15:36,520 --> 03:15:48,629
things that you ride in golden axe as a reference he's wait were you killing him wait are you strong

1257
03:15:48,629 --> 03:15:53,510
now i don't know what you skip you this is okay you read it you make fun of me every time i read

1258
03:15:53,510 --> 03:15:59,739
something every time we play together you try and like oh like oh wow like really okay okay like

1259
03:15:59,739 --> 03:16:07,260
doing me a favor and reading the thing on stream for me all right kind of weird what'd you do what

1260
03:16:07,260 --> 03:16:26,700
happened you went where you went somewhere last night yeah oh the skills up here skills up here

1261
03:16:27,340 --> 03:16:35,930
i don't like the bow it takes a lot are you using keyboard and mouse right so that probably would be

1262
03:16:35,930 --> 03:16:41,690
better for you it's it's helpful but i don't like the standing still hammer seems amazing by the

1263
03:16:41,690 --> 03:16:50,040
way it did seem that way wait what do we got frost wall or arcane bolts i'll take bolts

1264
03:16:51,879 --> 03:17:00,200
i like this one okay now i have two things i don't like god you want to start over me again

1265
03:17:00,200 --> 03:17:15,909
no i want to overcome yeah standing still tends to get you shot it's kind of rough

1266
03:17:16,469 --> 03:17:23,299
skills refresh quicker i'll take burn i haven't done burn you did burn it's pretty good

1267
03:17:24,899 --> 03:17:36,969
i guess i'll take it money or ember it's always money man that's what it's all about

1268
03:17:37,690 --> 03:17:41,690
how come that one chatter got a roblox birthday but i haven't gotten a minecraft party

1269
03:17:43,850 --> 03:18:17,860
uh uh uh they want to sweepstakes dude i'm the one who's firing ice now it's fun yeah they call

1270
03:18:17,860 --> 03:18:23,620
me frost burn when were the sweepstakes it was me looking over and reading a name and deciding

1271
03:18:23,620 --> 03:18:43,479
that i was gonna do the thing uh that one moment that was so brave of you that's a good move

1272
03:18:43,479 --> 03:18:58,409
by the way you're healing is increased your skills have an additional charge these are all amazing

1273
03:18:59,049 --> 03:19:12,069
the first perfect skill man that's 25 more damage for five seconds for the i mean that that is it

1274
03:19:12,069 --> 03:19:17,989
bad you're gonna you're gonna do a perfect skill so it's objectively bad because the only rooms

1275
03:19:17,989 --> 03:19:23,670
that matter are the boss rooms and then it's only damage one time in a boss room well i mean look

1276
03:19:23,670 --> 03:19:36,389
at this thing right here that's perfect for me love that for me works for my build so you're

1277
03:19:36,389 --> 03:19:44,659
right this is kind of like uh hey the only thing that i haven't seen that much of is the leveling

1278
03:19:44,659 --> 03:19:51,899
up skills but i feel like it's in the game right uh i don't know i know there's like more stuff in

1279
03:19:51,899 --> 03:19:55,500
the hub we haven't unlocked for sure when does hades 2 come out of wherever it is

1280
03:19:56,920 --> 03:20:11,819
i don't think they set a date hey dude when is the five minutes of freddy's i gotta wake up early

1281
03:20:11,819 --> 03:20:19,430

1283
03:20:25,190 --> 03:20:43,540
okay i do like about the bow that nothing attacks me and you you fight everything it is

1284
03:20:43,540 --> 03:21:03,270
it is kind of nice although it's kind of hard against bosses why very slow no no i'm talking

1285
03:21:03,270 --> 03:21:52,100
about the hammer it's kind of slow charge it up pal that does help whoa nice work there

1320
03:30:44,739 --> 03:30:49,139
health than me because i'm like hawkeye and you're the hulk yeah but the same shit's gonna happen

1321
03:30:49,139 --> 03:30:59,020
when i was the last one to fight the boss and i had no damage increase that was all my fault

1322
03:30:59,020 --> 03:31:06,860
i shouldn't have died i got hit by like everything you know what i mean like i just made a couple

1323
03:31:06,860 --> 03:31:12,809
crucial mistakes i won't let it happen again we got one of those things

1324
03:31:13,290 --> 03:31:21,399
so that makes me happy i'll learn i'll evolve i'll be better i'll do better

03:31:49,979 --> 03:32:02,280
to see the curse i placed on you um money i don't think we need money do you really you want the

1327

meta yeah we both have over 350 gold some things cost like 300 what does that stuff what does the

1328
03:32:24,329 --> 03:32:28,870
ember do uh that's when we go back to town at the end of the run and upgrade our character

1329
03:32:30,090 --> 03:32:58,860
oh okay you want stats or skills i want a skill i i hate my current skills i hate that i have

1330
03:32:58,860 --> 03:33:12,600
to kill these witches to get it though really start to settle into this character arcane bolts

1331
03:33:12,600 --> 03:33:19,239
is just so good i again i don't like either of these did you get the ability to reroll

it's part of the ember i didn't can i drop stuff i can reroll something for you did not maybe um

1333
03:33:29,750 --> 03:33:54,280

1334
03:33:54,280 --> 03:33:58,920
it took like it like you throw it and then it charges up by the time it charges up the

1335
03:33:58,920 --> 03:34:07,190
thing was dead just skip stick chakram dude chakram was good unless you like what you have is good

1336
03:34:07,829 --> 03:34:16,139
the burn thing is really good though i'm gonna keep what i have all right uh

1337
03:34:16,700 --> 03:34:22,940

item do you need me do you want me to help i'm kidding or am i i don't think you are

1339
03:34:31,479 --> 03:34:38,620

1340
03:34:38,620 --> 03:34:48,809
to be real and true at some point yeah that's true you ready you ready is it a double again

1341
03:34:48,809 --> 03:35:25,030
or just one oh i know this guy he's summoning boys like little snowballs we just destroyed

1342
03:35:25,030 --> 03:35:36,469
that guy yeah i feel like he was alive for a very short amount of time i'll get that meat i want to

03:35:36,469 --> 03:35:55,079
i want to see you eat it come on come on big boy come on big boy nice uh thanks for your continued

1344
03:35:55,079 --> 03:36:01,899

1345
03:36:04,459 --> 03:36:19,020

1346
03:36:19,020 --> 03:36:28,819
reroll talk to him wait let me see it real quick oh the oh bro i got a broken jar that i paid

1347
03:36:28,819 --> 03:36:36,649
400 dollars for before secret number nine good as new wow it's not worth much to me now that it's

1348
03:36:36,649 --> 03:36:42,649
empty your first skill using each room grants shield for five seconds that stops projectiles

1349
03:36:42,649 --> 03:36:50,329
and prevents damage to all nights inside of it i would say that's really good but it only happens

1350
03:36:50,329 --> 03:37:02,229
once yeah i don't know it's kind of like prevent damage won't you know that's all right uh i think

1351
03:37:02,229 --> 03:37:08,889
you should take impact charm that sounds like a hammer would do good with that does the hammer

1352
03:37:08,889 --> 03:37:17,700
stuns but i mean i guess i wonder what part of the combo is uh is this what you already had every

1353
03:37:17,700 --> 03:37:30,440
four enemies you defeat that thing's pretty good is the um is the stun the second or the i think

1354
03:37:30,440 --> 03:37:37,899
it's the third swing actually hammer applies slow not stun is it's everything applies stun it's like

1355
03:37:37,899 --> 03:37:43,030
everyone has like a stamina bar and if you get the opportunity to get the the shield charge that

1356
03:37:43,030 --> 03:37:59,979
always stuns we said come over andy let me make that actually what it is oh you missed you missed

1357
03:38:01,020 --> 03:38:13,819
silence oh so holly and i were um we watched uh we watched the hunchback of notredame

1358
03:38:14,860 --> 03:38:21,579
and the villain in the hunchback of notredame got us to really think about something if at any point

1359
03:38:22,459 --> 03:38:34,420
you ever utter the words silence you're you're evil right or enough silence that's the only you

1360
03:38:34,420 --> 03:38:40,020
aren't you're evil nobody has ever uttered that word that followed up with being good

1361
03:38:41,049 --> 03:38:47,030
i yeah i'm trying to think of examples uh go against that i i can't think of anything i i

1362
03:38:47,030 --> 03:38:55,940
don't think there is a single example silence unless you're like a kindergarten teacher maybe

1363
03:38:55,940 --> 03:39:17,079
maybe i'm really thinking of outliers what about gandalf gandalf says silence that he goes

1364
03:39:17,079 --> 03:39:30,360
silence silence dumbledore says silence yeah yeah gandalf is evil no he's not like teachers i feel

1365
03:39:30,360 --> 03:39:50,260
like our teachers and parents are the exception here silent gandalf gandalf is basically a parent

1366
03:39:50,260 --> 03:39:57,540
oh no no another thing too if anyone ever says i will see to this insolence insolence is another

1367
03:39:57,540 --> 03:40:09,860
one as well true but villains getting typecast out there they all say the same thing silence

1368
03:40:10,500 --> 03:40:16,100
i have had enough of this insolence that means this guy's fucked up and is doing awful shit

1369
03:40:16,659 --> 03:40:26,649
terrible things yeah well no foolish is i don't think foolish is there

1370
03:40:31,750 --> 03:40:41,290
insolent fools yeah actually maybe if you're right that is bad guy speak isn't it all right such

1371
03:40:41,290 --> 03:40:52,040
arrogance you're saying a lot of you're saying a lot of evil guy stuff at the moment i'm thinking

1372
03:40:52,760 --> 03:41:12,059
oh shit i was frozen i didn't know wake up wake up somebody said finally

1373
03:41:13,500 --> 03:41:19,989
i don't think it's finally i think it's at long last means the same thing but one of them is

1374
03:41:19,989 --> 03:41:27,000
inherently more evil me and you were both the same you're just like me yep that's another one

1375
03:41:27,959 --> 03:41:39,860
good that's a good one like you and i are the same i'll never be you i'll never be just like you

1376
03:41:39,860 --> 03:41:52,379
right yeah that happens a lot they do exist why is that funny right now

1377
03:41:57,219 --> 03:42:01,219
you letting that guy hit you i kind of was i've got too busy thinking of other things

1378
03:42:02,020 --> 03:42:13,350
it's doing like ad libs what would a villain say all right stir yeah i'm gonna say what

1379
03:42:13,350 --> 03:42:29,260
is this from they do exist what it was a good try i have no idea i have no idea what is it

1380
03:42:29,260 --> 03:42:39,239
that is santa from the 1998 television commercial the m&m's meet santa you're right i remember

that was unfair that's unfair dude isn't it though the only way something could ever

1386
03:44:25,030 --> 03:44:44,889
penetrate my defenses was with some cheap tactic get up late oh that got deleted

1387
03:44:48,379 --> 03:44:53,719

1388
03:44:53,719 --> 03:45:03,860
supposed to encourage that or something i feel like i do that a lot why are moderators removing

1389
03:45:03,860 --> 03:45:11,219
comments because they break the rules what are the rules you're afraid of like someone saying

1390
03:45:11,219 --> 03:45:21,639
something censorship i feel like i've seen people say like you're dumb and that doesn't get deleted

1391
03:45:21,639 --> 03:45:28,860
but what gets deleted is play five nights at freddy's you're gonna get mvp every time one

1392
03:45:28,860 --> 03:45:36,100
of them is an opinion the other one is a demand i think you should play five nights at freddy's

1393
03:45:36,100 --> 03:45:42,870
that's fine get rid of him that's an opinion well okay but that's i think you should play not

1394
03:45:42,870 --> 03:45:49,030
you need to play exactly okay but you said get rid of me there was still like a knee jerk get rid of

1399
03:46:52,979 --> 03:47:09,190
a skill gain bonus damage not like once per room i'm not about this once per room can you sing

1400
03:47:09,190 --> 03:47:13,350
happy birthday for my daughter

1401
03:47:22,700 --> 03:47:26,459
it was singing he was singing down here did you know that me me and ashley we have a rule when

1402
03:47:26,459 --> 03:47:31,100
we're watching tv like it's a i think i've maybe even said this before maybe i'm a broken record

1403
03:47:31,100 --> 03:47:37,139
where if someone in a show starts singing we skip you know you like just press forward like once

1404
03:47:37,139 --> 03:47:41,700
so it goes like 10 seconds forward if they're still singing you press it again just get get to

1405
03:47:41,700 --> 03:47:47,479
the end of it i kind of feel you the only way i think that that does not make sense if it's a

1406
03:47:47,479 --> 03:47:57,370
musical yeah well then you're you're obviously want every song like three words where they set

1407
03:47:57,370 --> 03:48:03,930
up the next song like oh yeah like oh and then just yeah it's like next next and here comes it

1408
03:48:03,930 --> 03:48:12,860
now now get rid of this hey uh you want to watch the musical but i i kind of don't want to

1409
03:48:13,819 --> 03:48:17,340
i don't like when people sing you mind i don't like songs

1410
03:48:19,750 --> 03:48:24,069
they want it you know my favorite fast time is i've talked about this a lot but i

1411
03:48:24,069 --> 03:48:32,709
i haven't i have ever talked about it with you uh the whole like hentai thing you pick a movie

1412
03:48:33,350 --> 03:48:40,790
and you watch only like two minutes of the movie and then you go forward how am i supposed to even

1413
03:48:40,790 --> 03:48:48,069
fucking talk after that one you take you take a movie and you watch 10 minutes and then you

1414
03:48:48,069 --> 03:48:55,670
skip like 30 minutes and then watch two minutes have you actually done this it's fucking fun as

1415
03:48:55,670 --> 03:49:04,899
hell why why because you can watch any shitty movie you want and it's only like 16 minutes of

1416
03:49:04,899 --> 03:49:12,180
commitment but you gain nothing no you get the whole movie trust me watch five minutes in the

1417
03:49:12,180 --> 03:49:20,420
beginning skip 20 minutes watch 10 minutes skip 25 minutes watch three minutes skip to the end

1418
03:49:20,420 --> 03:49:30,700
of the movie it's so fun it's so fun trust me i i feel like i might have done that at some point

1419
03:49:31,340 --> 03:49:35,739
it's not like intentionally so deliberate in it but like there's a couple shows where it's like i

1420
03:49:35,739 --> 03:49:41,180
i really need to know how this ends but i'm actually so sick of it and think it's bad you

1421
03:49:41,260 --> 03:49:48,229
just watch like five minutes of every episode oh my god i did that with lucifer i don't know

1422
03:49:49,190 --> 03:49:55,510
lucifer the fucking wait wait wait can we talk about it we had we have to talk about this in

1423
03:49:55,510 --> 03:50:02,069
detail can we yeah okay let's make a very very important point here this is going to be massive

1424
03:50:02,069 --> 03:50:07,879
spoilers for this show let's show lucifer right yeah yeah so this is big spoilers for lucifer

1425
03:50:07,879 --> 03:50:13,290
huge huge massive i want to i want you to talk because i want to see if you and i did the exact

1426
03:50:13,290 --> 03:50:20,459
same thing i enjoyed it for a bit and then i kind of got the formula and thought every episode was

1427
03:50:20,459 --> 03:50:26,780
boring but there's like five minutes of interesting content every episode so i would skip to the middle

1428
03:50:26,780 --> 03:50:31,959
watch two minutes skip to the very end of the episode watch two minutes next episode yeah i

1429
03:50:31,959 --> 03:50:40,760
was a little more egregious um but yes that is exactly what i'm talking about doing i okay this

1430
03:50:40,760 --> 03:50:45,079
is a huge spoiler so massive lucifer spoilers i'm serious i'm gonna write it on the screen

1431
03:50:47,479 --> 03:50:54,299
so i how many episodes are in the first season of lucifer i i i mean who i don't know let's say

1432
03:50:54,299 --> 03:51:00,600
it's like let's assume 10 let's just say it's 10 i hold on actually i feel like it's one of those

1433
03:51:00,600 --> 03:51:08,100
shows that has like 20 episode seasons but the first one might have been like seven i think it

1434
03:51:08,100 --> 03:51:15,879
was more like a season one pilot kind of thing you're looking it up right now no i'm just i'm

1435
03:51:15,879 --> 03:51:22,809
writing that is we're talking about spoilers okay so um i didn't really care about this show at all

1436
03:51:22,809 --> 03:51:30,389
i just saw the thumbnail of the show and it was just him like as lucifer right he's he looks like

1437
03:51:30,389 --> 03:51:36,459
the devil um i opened up episode one and i scrolled through to find when he becomes that like satan

1438
03:51:36,459 --> 03:51:42,579
character it doesn't happen i i went through every single episode scrolling through until he

1439
03:51:44,579 --> 03:51:50,180
first episode no no he doesn't no he doesn't he does no he doesn't he doesn't like at the very end

1440
03:51:50,180 --> 03:52:00,360
of the whole show no i mean no you're saying it's a spoiler that the show named lucifer

1441
03:52:00,360 --> 03:52:06,180
the guy turns into the devil yeah but he doesn't do it until like the one of the last episodes of

1442
03:52:06,180 --> 03:52:17,110
this first season i i think at the end he finally no no i'm telling you i'm telling you no he doesn't

1443
03:52:17,110 --> 03:52:26,040
in episode one he absolutely doesn't in the trailer yes in the like episode one he starts

1444
03:52:26,040 --> 03:52:31,879
by like tormenting some guy then he's like i'm the devil like fucking 10 minutes in he does so my

1445
03:52:31,879 --> 03:52:39,399
skip strategy was was had holes in it it's like a big reveal that other people realize he's that's

1446
03:52:39,399 --> 03:52:45,850
like way further on but i don't think he like shows himself as the devil to like a that's what

1447
03:52:45,850 --> 03:52:53,899
i'm saying it's really not what you're saying it's really not he doesn't like turn into like i'm satan

1448
03:52:54,059 --> 03:52:58,700
i am like i'm like horns and i'm like okay i'm like we're in spoiler mode the show gets so

1449
03:52:58,700 --> 03:53:03,260
fucking weird where he finally reveals after like three seasons to the detective he's working with

1450
03:53:03,260 --> 03:53:07,979
and he's like kind of in love with like hey i'm actually satan and she's like ah i don't know how

1451
03:53:07,979 --> 03:53:14,760
to cope with that and they have this like weird on and off like i have been partners with satan

1452
03:53:14,760 --> 03:53:20,760
for like the last couple years of my life and it's weird where she's like trying to come to terms

1453
03:53:20,760 --> 03:53:25,670
with like him being literal satan but we're talking about the okay let me make sure i got

1454
03:53:25,670 --> 03:53:34,579
the right show in the thumbnail he's like this like right like okay well netflix changes the

1455
03:53:34,579 --> 03:53:45,780
thumbnails a lot it's not always one thumbnail but i imagine yes that right there and he's like

1456
03:53:45,780 --> 03:53:53,319
and he's satan he is satan he does solve crime as satan wait hold on a minute this is now that's

1457
03:53:53,319 --> 03:53:57,799
a series of unfortunate events that's count all off right it's a different show hold on wait

1458
03:53:58,760 --> 03:54:06,870
this is the same thumbnail they used to stand the same exact thumbnail for both shows

1459
03:54:06,870 --> 03:54:11,420
that use they use that a lot but my point still stands he doesn't reveal that he's satan

1460
03:54:11,420 --> 03:54:17,659
until like the last episode no your your point was no spoilers did you know the main guy in lucifer

1461
03:54:17,659 --> 03:54:22,059
is lucifer no that's not what i'm saying i'm saying he doesn't like reveal that he's lucifer

1462
03:54:22,059 --> 03:54:30,219
until like the last episode of the first season no my chat's reminding me that like he has like

1463
03:54:30,219 --> 03:54:34,540
a devil face and he even he even calls it like devil face like a fucking preschooler

1464
03:54:36,149 --> 03:54:44,620
and he doesn't do like devil face to someone for a bit but he's like very obviously satan

1465
03:54:45,860 --> 03:54:50,979
yeah but he doesn't he doesn't have the like he doesn't have that look until like the last

1466
03:54:50,979 --> 03:54:57,989
episode of the first season you might be right about that i'm telling you i i i'm gonna i think

1467
03:54:57,989 --> 03:55:05,270
i'm correct but it's not like they're hiding it no you know it's obviously that guy is lucifer

1468
03:55:05,270 --> 03:55:09,430
i'm just saying they don't do like that thumbnail face until one of the last episodes of the first

1469
03:55:09,430 --> 03:55:15,959
season okay and you you skipped every episode to find the face i just wanted to see a scene of him

1470
03:55:15,959 --> 03:55:20,819
being like oh yes it's me satan i just wanted to find it and i couldn't find it took me to the last

1471
03:55:20,819 --> 03:55:30,620
episode okay you didn't watch it no i didn't i'm telling you i scrubbed through every episode just

1472
03:55:30,620 --> 03:55:39,030
to find the one time but he did it was it worth it he does it every single episode i gotta go back

1473
03:55:39,030 --> 03:55:44,629
and do some he really does we're like he he ends up trying to catch the person before his detective

1474
03:55:44,629 --> 03:55:48,870
buddy does and then he goes devil mode on him to be like you shouldn't have done that by the way

1475
03:55:48,870 --> 03:55:56,729
i'm satan and then he like does some satan stuff in the first episode he definitely it has to be

1476
03:55:56,729 --> 03:56:09,450
in the first episode man he does it every episode yeah that's that's how i'm remembering it

1477
03:56:10,409 --> 03:56:20,139
though i do think like i don't know season one probably has some like melodramatic reveal of

1478
03:56:20,139 --> 03:56:25,819
like his real true satan self i i need to go i'm gonna have to do some homework tonight

1479

1489
03:59:37,719 --> 03:59:44,069

1491
03:59:53,350 --> 04:00:00,860
it's the only so awful yep and you can't really have a big fan in the room because it kind of

1492
04:00:00,860 --> 04:00:10,819
pops up to the mic and it's like the chat they don't know uh it'll be like 80 degrees in my room

1493
04:00:10,819 --> 04:00:15,940
and i i finished streaming and leave my room and the the rest of the the house feels like 60

1551
04:14:09,459 --> 04:14:16,020
the anime akuma turn his back and look at us with the eye flash uh he's saying that we're not useless

1554
04:14:52,940 --> 04:14:58,860
how could they have ever known to hit the crystals that were connecting the robots to the shields

1555
04:14:58,860 --> 04:15:04,219
oh it only takes no way it takes two hits oh how could they have figured that out in time

1556
04:15:06,629 --> 04:15:15,079
two hits really my my damage is not good evil villain tropes are so funny

1557
04:15:15,799 --> 04:15:22,920
she's like and they'll never get away from this i love i loved in diablo 3 when asmodan would

1558
04:15:22,920 --> 04:15:28,040
fucking monologue you every level actual chrono trigger joke yeah that is it is a chrono trigger

1559
04:15:28,040 --> 04:15:44,540
joke have you played chrono trigger no can i pay you to play it i imagine there's a price

1560
04:15:45,420 --> 04:16:08,040
damn it how long is it um it's pretty long it's a solid at least it's at least 20 30 hours at

1561
04:16:08,040 --> 04:16:30,969
least i'd say probably somewhere around 40 you want to do everything i'm saying 20 20 yeah when

1562
04:16:30,969 --> 04:16:36,979
you uh when you beat jade cocoon i'll play it no that's kind of unfair though because

1563
04:16:37,059 --> 04:16:43,139
chrono trigger has had five re-releases on a bunch of different platforms i i i either have to

1564
04:16:43,139 --> 04:16:48,819
emulate this game or i have to buy it randomly from some well you just said you would pay me

1565
04:16:48,819 --> 04:16:54,340
to play chrono trigger and my price is you playing jade cocoon okay i've named my price

1566
04:16:55,299 --> 04:17:08,020
that's just the way it's gonna be if you're you're sitting there like you know like chrono

1567
04:17:08,020 --> 04:17:12,739
trigger is one of the greatest games of all time he hasn't played like chrono he has dude someone

1568
04:17:12,739 --> 04:17:19,399
else besides me has to have played jade cocoon no every time i bring it up everyone's like what

1569
04:17:19,399 --> 04:17:39,219
what's that i've heard it was really good i've heard it was so sick of it oh this is a

1618
04:27:27,690 --> 04:27:33,610
actually did hammer yeah but we could be getting roguelike because i mean i don't think so you

1619
04:27:33,610 --> 04:27:50,969
don't think so this is this is tricky this is hard my camera is being really weird i mean it's

1620
04:27:50,969 --> 04:28:04,739

1625
04:29:36,600 --> 04:29:46,299
oh yeah i'm glad you did that because you got to the end i mean i think this is uh the final

1626
04:29:46,299 --> 04:29:58,620
there would be one more area in 1.0 is what i think is how it's going to be congratulations

1627
04:29:58,620 --> 04:30:05,350
don't let your guard down as there's plenty of new content coming yeah i hope you're the mvp

1628
04:30:05,350 --> 04:30:12,010

04:30:12,010 --> 04:30:22,329

1638
04:31:46,620 --> 04:31:58,860
hiding it either uh we want to know skill convergence and creation device that lets you

1639
04:31:58,860 --> 04:32:04,139
break down skill tablets into their most basic parts like miniscule i mean so small you can't

1640
04:32:04,139 --> 04:32:10,950
even see them dude then it transmute demographize them into new skills so you can wait can you make

1641
04:32:11,829 --> 04:32:23,500
a new mechanic what do we got uh anyway we can convert the skill tablets you find into new

1642
04:32:23,500 --> 04:32:28,379
skills pretty great huh if you find any more be sure to bring them back to me what's the skill

1643
04:32:28,379 --> 04:32:37,180
tablet acquire skill i guess we could never find them before because we never did we didn't have

1644
04:32:37,180 --> 04:32:50,360
him yet oh okay what's the what's the last weapon razor wind there's also another weapon

1645
04:32:51,079 --> 04:32:57,239
oh this is such a this is a stir weapon this is such a stir weapon spectral throw is one

1646
04:32:57,239 --> 04:33:05,689
of my favorite skills you're not wrong actually it's good but it takes a long time to load up a

1647
04:33:05,689 --> 04:33:12,650
perfect yeah but it still has like a quick attack just like the sword does sword doesn't have a

1648
04:33:12,650 --> 04:33:20,580
charge thing right the thing with the sword is has the dash move does the dash attack so you can

1649
04:33:20,580 --> 04:33:26,659
kind of just get it and get up whenever you hit an enemy with your charge attack your chain attacks

1650
04:33:26,659 --> 04:33:31,299
become empowered and deal bonus damage i don't know what chain attack is maybe the lightning

1651
04:33:31,299 --> 04:33:43,060
chains yeah okay i wonder what the last uh there's one more weapon that's not here yet

1652
04:33:45,860 --> 04:33:52,819
truly who knows all right well are you ready to play five nights at freddy's which one should

1653
04:33:52,819 --> 04:34:02,009
he play should you play one or two hey i got them both stirred remember when you said uh uh

1654
04:34:02,009 --> 04:34:06,250
what was it about how you were just gonna be the entertainment on the stream

1655
04:34:06,729 --> 04:34:15,369
uh yeah well hey everybody we're gonna raid stir i'm gonna stay in the call and we're gonna watch

1656
04:34:15,369 --> 04:34:22,580
him play so you what you said was accurate yeah so we figured that would be the best way to do

1657
04:34:22,580 --> 04:34:27,540
it because otherwise it's hard with like stream delays for him to even actually watch yeah so i'm

1658
04:34:27,540 --> 04:34:32,099
just gonna stay in the call i'm gonna raid him and we're gonna watch five nights at freddy's i'm

1659
04:34:32,099 --> 04:34:39,060
gonna be in the call people saying play both let's get a poll all in your chat all in my chat

1660
04:34:39,700 --> 04:34:45,610
could he do one or two because i'm just gonna let's be realistic stir be realistic too you're

1661
04:34:45,610 --> 04:34:52,099
probably gonna play this for like 30 minutes and uninstall both of them i you said beating the game

1662
04:34:52,099 --> 04:35:00,500
was like two hours give or take then if two is the better one maybe we should just do two let's see

1663
04:35:00,500 --> 04:35:05,459
because i feel like if it took that long to like legitimately beat one and move on to two i would

1664
04:35:05,459 --> 04:35:11,849
not want to play too at that point one is way more beginner friendly i'm not a beginner yeah but

1665
04:35:11,849 --> 04:35:16,970
this is a bunch of weird shit the balloon boy and you gotta put a mask on when they come into the

1666
04:35:16,970 --> 04:35:25,740
room and stuff i think i don't know we'll see what does your chat say uh i didn't make a poll

1667
04:35:26,549 --> 04:35:32,200
and there's like one guy that said please play too okay so do you want to go by the one guy in

1668
04:35:32,200 --> 04:35:36,540
your chat or do you want to go by what what's going on over here like you you'll be here to

1670
04:35:40,779 --> 04:35:46,860

1671
04:35:46,860 --> 04:35:50,869

1672
04:35:50,869 --> 04:35:59,159
