1
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:49,189
Hey, what's up? Yeah, um, uh, yeah, why are you acting like I delayed the stream two days ago?

2
00:00:50,009 --> 00:00:57,909
Delayed it again yesterday and then came in today and reverse delayed back to today.

3
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:16,569
I think I didn't do that. This is outrageous. Yeah, I figured. All right, so I got some stuff done

4
00:01:16,569 --> 00:01:23,099
that I wanted to get done. And I did say, wait, well, maybe we'll do an Omega gaming weekend.

5
00:01:25,129 --> 00:01:32,010
No, no, let's just go now. I'm ready to hang out now for a little bit. Sometimes I, you know,

6
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:39,769
you just get the urge. You want to go. So that's exactly what we're going to do. Welcome back.

7
00:01:39,769 --> 00:01:48,280
We're going to play Xbox games, original Xbox. The plan is still on Saturday to play Elden Ring

8
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:59,129
with Ster. So that's still the plan. You smell what you don't have. You have no idea what I

9
00:01:59,129 --> 00:02:19,020
smell like. You have no idea. It's called old piss. Anyways, you need to change your pin tweet.

10
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:23,580
I don't think it's ever going to happen. You know what? I, my pin tweet will change once.

11
00:02:24,379 --> 00:02:32,360
Uh, honestly, probably when grotto beasts is like ready and here and ready to go,

12
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:42,580
that will be the pin tweet very soon. A lot of things in 2023 that I just, they're very exciting

13
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:49,050
and I don't know how to tell you them, but I've seen a lot of copiums.

14
00:02:49,930 --> 00:03:00,090
Uh, just wait, just wait. It's, I, I'm not talking. I'm not saying anything.

15
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:07,560
I'm not going to say anything. All I'm telling you is that grotto beasts is imminent,

16
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:12,840
very imminent to a point that I think a lot of people might not understand. I think a lot of

17
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:17,159
people like, Oh yeah, he keeps saying it. Oh, it'd be a few months. It'll be a few months.

18
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:29,800
Grotto piece is imminent, imminent, but I want to give you a real date when I have it, but it's

19
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:36,969
imminent. No, I didn't just learn that word today. I've said imminent a few months ago when I talked

20
00:03:36,969 --> 00:03:49,639
about this as well. I didn't just find that word out. I know words guys. I know words.

21
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:56,740
I have at least a higher functioning caveman intelligence. I know words. I have a vocabulary.

22
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:11,219
Media, imminent. Oh, what, what? That word, imminent media, imminent.

23
00:04:11,939 --> 00:04:29,560
Ooh, I say that word now too. You should play dark and darker. I'm, I'm going to,

24
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:38,439
I just have to find the opportunity when I want to do that. Cause that game has gone into alpha

25
00:04:38,439 --> 00:04:42,040
for like a weekend, come out of the alpha weekend, go back into an alpha weekend. Right.

26
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:47,879
When it's in beta, when the game, when I can just play the game whenever I want,

27
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:53,720
that's when I'll do it. I, is it a closed beta? I really do not have been really paying that much

28
00:04:53,720 --> 00:05:02,649
attention. I will be honest. Why do you hate the last of us? I've never played the last of us.

29
00:05:02,649 --> 00:05:08,170
No, that's a lie. I believe I'm in a long time. So let me see if my memory can piece together.

30
00:05:09,209 --> 00:05:19,290
I think I did the PlayStation now stream feature connected to a friend and like played the game

31
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:27,589
through their game. Am I making that up? It's been a while. And I think I played like the first 40

32
00:05:27,589 --> 00:05:34,470
minutes that way. PlayStation had this feature where you could like stream the game to somebody

33
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:45,670
and they could take control of it. It was very weird, very weird system. Read this, read this,

34
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:58,009
read this relax. Will you relax? It's share play. Yeah. So yeah. Okay. So I got like a,

35
00:05:58,009 --> 00:06:04,170
I got like a fucking 1500 bit rate share play version of the first 40 minutes of the last of

36
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:11,740
us. I don't know. I just didn't play it. I didn't play it. So what? Oh, well, I didn't play God of

37
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:19,610
War either. Well, I played the first hour of that. It's phenomenal by the way. That's the worst way

38
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:31,319
you could have played it. Yeah. But what, who cares? But hope you're doing well. What a fake fan.

39
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:35,079
I had never told you I was a fan of the last of us. When have I ever talked about that?

40
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:41,899
Has there been a stream where I've sat here and gone, oh, last of us. Let me just, let me just

41
00:06:41,899 --> 00:06:45,339
tell you all about it. Oh, I could take, I could talk for hours about last of us. That's never

42
00:06:45,339 --> 00:06:58,199
happened. Hurry up. You relax, settle down. You, I, you did. I remember it. That was actually kind

43
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:04,759
of funny. That actually would be really funny. If somebody has like a clip from like a few years

44
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:12,279
ago or something of me being like, Oh my God, it's so good. I just never played it. That's funny.

45
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:18,620
I will accept that if that, if that's the case. But anyways, yeah, we're gonna play more Xbox.

46
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:23,579
We're going to start kind of right where we left off with Obi-Wan. We're not going to play Obi-Wan,

47
00:07:23,579 --> 00:07:32,740
but the one that's coming up in the list was the DaVinci code. DaVinci code. Are you guys ready?

48
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:38,759
Are you ready to play a little bit of Xbox? And then again, next time I'll see you after this,

49
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:46,920
the weekend stir randomizer Elden Ring co-op stream is still happening on Saturday and Sunday.

50
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:51,480
Well, Saturday. And then if we, you know, we're giving ourselves the option to do it Sunday as

51
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:59,829
well. Cause what if we're just not having any fun at all? That's the plan. And let's go. I think

52
00:07:59,829 --> 00:08:12,819
we're ready to get rolling here. Just make sure this is plugged in correctly. Let's see. Can you

53
00:08:12,819 --> 00:08:28,120
see it? By the way, haven't seen this movie either. I've never seen this movie. I've never, I've never,

54
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:38,200
it's a book, right? Is it a book or a movie? I don't know. This is the DaVinci code video game

55
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:47,860
based on the movie, based on the book. Okay. All right. I'm ready. You guys ready? The DaVinci code.

56
00:08:50,230 --> 00:09:06,299
Whoa. New game. Okay. I would like to create a save game. Anybody played this? Is this any good?

57
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:15,350
Tom Hanks is in this. I, I, okay. Here's the only way that I would say I think Tom Hanks is in this

58
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:23,049
game. It's stuff like, Oh, what are you talking about? Huh? We have to get over there. And it's

59
00:09:23,049 --> 00:09:29,820
just stuff from the movie that they just kind of sentence mix together, right? There's option one.

60
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:36,039
Option two is it's an impersonator. So I, I don't think this is, if it's Tom Hanks, actually like

61
00:09:36,039 --> 00:09:42,679
Tom Hanks as, um, DaVinci detective, whatever he was, I would be surprised if it wasn't just like

62
00:09:42,679 --> 00:09:48,169
sentence kind of mixing from stuff he set up previously on the movie. Let's find out. Let's

63
00:09:48,169 --> 00:10:38,259
go. Start game. Let's go. That's not Tom Hanks. Kind of reminds me of Bale. Paris by my lecture

64
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:43,059
at the American university and followed by an unexpected invitation. That's Tom Hanks.

65
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:53,980
Professor Langdon, thank you for coming. I am captain Bezoufash. Do you know this man?

66
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:59,659
Chauxinier, a curator of the Louvre. I was supposed to meet him tonight after my speech.

67
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:09,539
Is it? Follow me. It kind of sounds like him. Is that actually? No, but it's from the movie.

68
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:38,870
Yes. But it's not original dialogue. It's from the movie. That's a huge, heavy ass painting.

69
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:57,500
You should not have run. Now tell me please. I beg you. Is it? All right. All right.

70
00:12:10,389 --> 00:12:11,590
This is like shot.

71
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:44,860
What? So it's so intense. Where did he shoot him? All right. What kind of game even is this?

72
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:50,860
So this should be of no surprise. Feel free to examine the body, Mr. Langdon.

73
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:56,490
It's like a detective game. Search the body for clues relating to his death.

74
00:12:56,490 --> 00:13:04,980
Why is this in a window like this? This is in a window inside of a window. What did that say?

75
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:11,980
What the hell is going on here? All right. The position of his feet reinforces the reference

76
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:18,470
to the Pinnacle and the sacred feminine. Replication. Repeating a symbol is the

77
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:24,070
simplest way to strengthen its meaning. Chauxinier positioned himself in the shape of a five-pointed

78
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:34,259
star. That's not Tom Hanks. That's not Tom Hanks. Interesting analysis. That sounds like Ross from

79
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:42,629
Friends. Is it? It's a Pinnacle. One of the oldest symbols on earth.

80
00:13:42,629 --> 00:13:48,470
Used over 4,000 years before Christ. Devil worship. It's an actor. No. The Pinnacle is

81
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:53,590
a pre-Christian symbol that relates to nature worship. The ancients envisioned their world in

82
00:13:53,590 --> 00:14:02,149
two halves. Masculine and feminine. It's the ancient alien's narrator? What? Oh my god.

83
00:14:02,149 --> 00:14:06,149
What? Ancient aliens?

84
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:22,840
Wow. Okay. So yeah. Yep. All right. We saw that. What is this?

85
00:14:28,519 --> 00:14:29,960
That's a great Tom Hanks.

86
00:14:37,909 --> 00:15:11,830
Wait. It's a marker. It's not blood?

87
00:15:16,179 --> 00:15:30,379
As you know. You know, as you know, us detectives, we do these things.

88
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:37,779
What does this mean? That, monsieur, is precisely the question you are here to answer.

89
00:15:38,659 --> 00:15:45,139
Part of it looks like a numeric cipher. Yes, our cryptographers are already working on it.

90
00:15:46,179 --> 00:15:51,539
What is this game? These numbers may be the key to who killed him. This is like a CSI game, but it's

91
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:56,580
Tom Hanks and it's the movie. Does this happen in the movie?

92
00:15:56,659 --> 00:16:02,019
An accusation against his murder makes sense, I suppose. Sonnier was a Frenchman. He lived in

93
00:16:02,019 --> 00:16:11,700
Paris. This happens in the movie just like this. I have seen a lot of death in my work and let me

94
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:16,740
tell you something. When a man is murdered by another man, I do not believe his final

95
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:23,620
thoughts are to write an obscure spiritual statement that no one will understand. I believe

96
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:30,419
he is thinking of one thing only. La vengeance. I believe Sonnier wrote this note to tell us

97
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:37,769
Oh, but that makes no sense whatsoever. You told me Sonnier was attacked by someone

98
00:16:37,769 --> 00:16:42,490
he had apparently invited in. Considering the circumstances, I would assume that if

99
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:46,409
Sonnier wanted to tell you who killed him, he would have written down somebody's name.

100
00:16:46,649 --> 00:16:48,730
Precisement, précisement.

101
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:51,769
One moment please.

102
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:56,970
No, I'm not skipping it.

103
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:05,059
Unacceptable. I made it very clear. Captain, please excuse the interruption, but

104
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:09,299
I have deciphered the numeric code.

105
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:14,180
We already got the code deciphered. Hey, Resident Sleepers, we already got the code

106
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:18,339
deciphered. It took us 15 seconds in the cutscene. The US Embassy asked that you phone in as soon as

107
00:17:18,339 --> 00:17:22,740
possible. While I explained the code to Captain Fash, you need to make this call.

108
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:30,740
Thank you. Where can I find a phone? This line is secure. You may use it.

109
00:17:34,539 --> 00:17:38,779
What that actually means is that phone is bugged. It's the most bugged phone we've ever had.

110
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:48,150
I'm sorry, Miss Nouveau. I think you may have given me the wrong.

111
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:52,630
No, that is the right number. It's the three digit code on the paper I gave you.

112
00:17:53,349 --> 00:17:56,789
What? The embassy has an automated message. It kind of looks like he's like,

113
00:17:58,309 --> 00:18:03,859
it looks like it's a little too tight. Okay, so examine an item. I should look at that.

114
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:15,750
Select the item. Okay. What does it want me to do? Is that it is some kind of.

115
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:18,069
Well, I missed everything. This isn't important.

116
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:27,180
Examine the item. In his final hours of life. Oh, shit. Okay. Clues.

117
00:18:27,819 --> 00:18:35,349
Okay. What game is this? No, we're not skipping. You got, we have to follow the rules.

118
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:53,740
Ooh. Who do I, who do I, I wasn't looking. Who do I talk to? Is it you?

119
00:18:58,089 --> 00:19:01,049
Who is that? Who's captain? Who's the, what is, where's the captain?

120
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:14,089
I don't think this is relevant. Who's the captain? Wait, I need a phone number to call.

121
00:19:14,089 --> 00:19:26,710
What? There's only like two people in the room. That's what, dude, I can't talk to either of these

122
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:36,650
people. So you mean to tell me that in his final hours of life. Dark souls music. I certainly hope

123
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:51,750
you have. Oh, look at that. Okay. Use the phone to call the three digit number.

124
00:19:51,829 --> 00:19:59,450
A progression sum of the two preceding towers. What was it? Never heard of it.

125
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:06,700
Mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci created the succession of numbers in the 13th century.

126
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:11,180
Obviously there can be no coincidence that all of the numbers Sonia wrote on the floor belonged

127
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:24,220
to Fibonacci. Stop talking. This isn't working. Three digit four, five, four. I was going to say

128
00:20:24,299 --> 00:20:30,619
that nobody has a three digit phone number. What is it? Like fucking 1400. I know that's a family

129
00:20:30,619 --> 00:20:35,980
guy joke. That's a family guy joke. I know. Oh, what is this? Is this three? Yeah. I, I, look,

130
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:40,470
I get it. I know everyone's going to spam that in a second, but a three digit telephone number,

131
00:20:43,799 --> 00:20:52,460
four, five, four. This isn't what I'm looking for. What is he saying? What does this mean?

132
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:59,500
There's not a fucking phone number. I'm pissed.

133
00:21:11,259 --> 00:21:27,269
I got a minus two that says be original. The person that made this comment is the real

134
00:21:27,269 --> 00:21:36,859
Peter Griffin is their name. That's the name of the chatter. You love that show. You should

135
00:21:36,859 --> 00:21:45,319
have been happy about that. The restrooms are at the end of the grand gallery.

136
00:21:45,319 --> 00:21:53,299
You should have been very happy. I had to go to the bathroom.

137
00:22:00,099 --> 00:22:06,660
I'd like a little bit of privacy. No more than 45 minutes. At that point, it's a little too weird.

138
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:11,049
Do you agree? I agree. I think that is correct.

139
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:27,930
Hey, hit the fucking hand thing. The fan.

140
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:32,410
Hit the hand dryer so nobody hears us.

141
00:22:46,099 --> 00:22:49,299
Weird. It was stuck out of your neck. I don't know how you did not notice.

142
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:59,160
In case you decide to run. In fact, they hope you do run because it would make their case much

143
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:04,359
stronger. Why would I run? I'm innocent. Do you recall the three lines of text that Sonia

144
00:23:04,359 --> 00:23:09,319
wrote on the floor? What you saw was not the entire message. This is a photo of the complete

145
00:23:09,319 --> 00:23:16,859
message. Why would Sonia write this? Was he trying to frame me? No, he wrote it for me. The number of

146
00:23:16,859 --> 00:23:22,539
code is meaningless. Sonia wrote it to make sure the investigation included cryptography, ensuring

147
00:23:22,539 --> 00:23:27,420
that I would know as soon as possible what had happened to him. Why you specifically? How do

148
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:31,740
you know it wasn't for some other cryptographer? P.S. is the nickname he called me when I lived

149
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:36,779
with him. All of a sudden, we're just going to hear a flush from the stall. It's like,

150
00:23:40,539 --> 00:23:45,819
he was my grandfather. Where's Langdon? Still in the man's room, sir. We are seeing small movements,

151
00:23:45,819 --> 00:23:52,380
so the GPS dot is obviously still on him. Perhaps he feels ill. If he had found the

152
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:59,190
dot, he would have removed it and tried to run. Hm, fine. Start screaming for no reason.

153
00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:04,630
Fash will be taking you into custody any minute. You gotta just, just breathe in and out of each

154
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:10,309
other. We need to act now. You want me to run? It's the smartest thing you could do. If you stay,

155
00:24:10,309 --> 00:24:14,309
you will spend weeks in a French jail. But if you get to your embassy, then your government

156
00:24:14,309 --> 00:24:18,789
can protect you while I prove you had nothing to do with this murder. Forget it. You need to

157
00:24:18,789 --> 00:24:23,190
tell Fash that the message on the floor was for you and that my name is not there as an accusation.

158
00:24:23,829 --> 00:24:29,990
Fash is convinced you are guilty. The only way to get you out is with a distraction. The GPS tracking

159
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:35,190
dot? We need them to think you are running. If we can throw it out the window onto one of the cows

160
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:38,630
going by, I bet a lot of the police would clear out. Wait, throw it out? Wouldn't that be moving

161
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:43,349
really fast all of a sudden? See if you can find something to attach it to that would make it

162
00:24:43,349 --> 00:24:53,259
heavier. Like, oh wow, we picked up, um, Tom Hanks is now going 70 miles per hour right now.

163
00:24:54,059 --> 00:24:59,259
And in weird, it looks like he was going like 100, 200 miles per hour out of a window,

164
00:24:59,819 --> 00:25:16,019
like really fast, losing elevation quickly and then drove very fast. I hope he's okay. Okay,

165
00:25:16,019 --> 00:25:24,309
so I have to find something that's going to weigh this down. I'm not leaving yet. No,

166
00:25:24,869 --> 00:25:42,599
I need to weigh it down. Is it like an examine button? There's a sneak button too. All right,

167
00:25:42,599 --> 00:25:52,299
cool. You can pick up items like the soap. I can use this soap that will work.

168
00:25:52,940 --> 00:26:03,930
Come help me open this window. Open to every stall. Oh, he's trying. He's trying to get away.

169
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:09,930
He's trying to, he's trying to sneak out the window. Where's Langdon? Stealing the men's room.

170
00:26:09,930 --> 00:26:33,900
I knew it. He is trying to escape. Go down the toilet. Hurry Robert. Hurry Robert.

171
00:26:34,380 --> 00:27:11,660
Hey, it was like minus 15 last night. It was frozen. Combine items. Hold on. They heard the

172
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:37,589
wit. What? Hold on a second. These are the dumbest detectives I've ever seen. There's no way. If

173
00:27:37,589 --> 00:27:43,349
you're going to open up all of them, he's going to get a call on his phone at the last one.

174
00:27:44,460 --> 00:28:06,940
Oh wait, you have a new location? Of course. Of course. You pre-watched. No, that's just

175
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:16,220
welcome to every single. We're trying to hide from someone. Wait, we're here. We're literally

176
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:27,019
in the place.

177
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:58,230
Oh, lame saint. Wait, what am I doing? What do I have to do? It's a puzzle. Do all Lang sign?

178
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:55,460
Uh, how about uh, let, let, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, let home. Let, let him not let him cook.

179
00:29:58,390 --> 00:30:10,420
I might. Oh, you have it in emote only. I see what you're doing. This game takes around five

180
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:16,420
hours to complete. Two of them are cutscenes. Are you serious? Okay. Um, I think what about a hint?

181
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:21,460
An anagram is when the letters of a word or words are mixed up to form other words.

182
00:30:24,279 --> 00:30:30,839
Uh, captain, I think I see a couple of people here. They look like the perpetrators.

183
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:36,839
No, no, it's definitely the way all the rats hang out in the alley where the ping is going off.

184
00:30:37,779 --> 00:30:51,589
Uh, okay. I guess I will just go back to what I was doing. It's going to be like the, the,

185
00:30:55,289 --> 00:31:07,640
the, the, the song, the same, the same, the same time they were killed at the same time.

186
00:31:08,279 --> 00:31:44,170
I don't, I have no idea. I've ran out of hints. The, this all the main, like the main main street,

187
00:31:44,809 --> 00:32:02,630
the main sale, the main, the main lasso. I don't think that's correct. Oh, lame saint. Wait,

188
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:07,589
what do you mean? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. What? That was correct. Do you think that was right?

189
00:32:07,589 --> 00:32:24,039
How do I check it? The main, did I actually have it? Main lasso. I had it right. I'm pretty good

190
00:32:24,039 --> 00:32:37,210
at this then. Is that it? No, that's not. It's the main something then the main,

191
00:32:37,769 --> 00:32:46,500
wait, it is the main something. Stop posting a delicious meal. Like I've seen it a few times

192
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:50,900
and it's making me hungry and I don't want to see it anymore. It's delicious, nutritious,

193
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:59,319
and it isn't weird. It's not a strange thing to eat sometimes. Okay. The, oh, sorry. I had a bunch

194
00:32:59,319 --> 00:33:03,240
of vegetables, like a ton of like really good for you, like high in a bunch of different vitamins.

195
00:33:03,559 --> 00:33:07,640
Incredibly good for you. Good for your brain and shit. Oh no, I ate food that's really good

196
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:28,390
for your brain. I don't know how to do this. All right. It's the, the, the, the ale, old,

197
00:33:29,349 --> 00:33:45,029
the old, the slow, oh, lame saint. Is this in the movie? Did they figure this out in the movie

198
00:33:45,029 --> 00:33:53,000
really early on? Does Tom Hanks go, oh, lame saint, the main silo, right? Does this actually

199
00:33:53,000 --> 00:34:03,500
happen in the movie? Is the answer in the movie? Is it really? It's in the movie. All right. Give

200
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:20,010
me five more minutes and I'll get it. The, the most, the lost, wait a minute, the lost, the lost,

201
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:54,739
the loser. Maybe it's not the, how, the, how she should, give me the first, give me the first

202
00:34:54,739 --> 00:34:59,219
letter. Give me the first letter. This is, I look, I'm sorry. I don't, I don't, these are cool for

203
00:34:59,219 --> 00:35:05,269
like a Sunday newspaper. I, give me the first letter. Just give me the first letter and I,

204
00:35:05,909 --> 00:35:09,989
give me the first letter or I'm not moving on. I'll sit here all day. Give me the first letter.

205
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:26,519
T. All right. So I had it right. It's definitely the, not like this. All right. The, so the what?

206
00:35:26,519 --> 00:35:51,860
The, the late, the most, the most, the most, the nice, the, the what? All right. What's,

207
00:35:51,860 --> 00:36:04,150
all right. Second word, first letter, second word, first letter, second word, first letter.

208
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:24,920
No, no, no, no. The moon? The question mark. Hold on. The, the salt. I see a lot of salt

209
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:30,420
shakers. The salt. No nuts. What? What's, why can I do two A's? Wait, wait, wait, wait. Go back.

210
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:42,119
How do I go back? What just happened? Oh, there are two ways. The salt. Okay. The, there's no T.

211
00:36:42,679 --> 00:36:56,519
The salt, sugar, the spice, the spicy, the spice, the sugar, the ice cream, the malted,

212
00:36:57,559 --> 00:37:19,610
the sugary, the M, the main silo, the main lasso, the main, did I have it right? The main, the main

213
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:42,820
lasso, the main solo, the main solo, the main losa, the main as also, the main also, the main also,

214
00:37:45,429 --> 00:38:21,719
the main also. The, the, the mom, the mom. Why are you spamming Bob Ross? Why are you spamming

215
00:38:21,719 --> 00:38:44,199
Bob Ross? The Bob, the painter. The, the mist. No, the mist. Bob Ross. Painting? Painting. Education.

216
00:38:45,420 --> 00:39:29,219
Follow along video series. Paint. Bob Ross. What does that mean though? Give me the next letter.

217
00:39:29,219 --> 00:39:50,630
I was just staring at the chat with like my mouth open. The mole, the main, the ma, ah, the ma,

218
00:39:51,909 --> 00:40:03,139
mo, me, mom. You're an expert at charades. You got this. Bob Ross. Picture. Bob Ross. Snap, snap.

219
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:13,539
Paint. Picture. Picture. Picture. Painting. Picture. It's not, that's not what it is.

220
00:40:13,539 --> 00:40:17,219
That can't be what it is. That can't be. No, no, no, no, no, no. That can't be what it is.

221
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:20,179
No, that can't be what it is. The shit that's on the fucking cover of the box.

222
00:40:21,269 --> 00:40:25,829
I did not know. I did not know that's what this game was about. I didn't know. I, I didn't know.

223
00:40:25,829 --> 00:40:30,309
I didn't know what it was. I thought it was Mona. I, that's the shit. That's literally the front.

224
00:40:30,309 --> 00:40:37,400
That's on the box. The Mona Lisa's on the cover. But like I, and it burnt into the screen. I was

225
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:44,599
on it for so long. All right, relax. I didn't. I've never seen the movie.

226
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:59,559
This screen burning is so bad. I was on that for so long. That was painful. I didn't think

227
00:40:59,559 --> 00:41:09,400
it was going to be. Dude, give me a break. I did not know what this movie was about.

228
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:17,159
Lena Da Vinci. I didn't think they were going to give us spoilers in the first five minutes.

229
00:41:18,199 --> 00:41:25,960
No, we don't know how long the grand gallery will stay empty. You have to go now.

230
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:38,309
I will see you at the embassy, Ms. Yolanda. That's that person that, okay. Wait, new character.

231
00:41:42,070 --> 00:41:57,320
Okay. So what's the objective? Find a UV light. Isn't that, isn't that in the case over here?

232
00:42:02,119 --> 00:42:13,110
The main, the main, what was it? The main lasso. I forgot this whole game was about a painting.

233
00:42:13,909 --> 00:42:20,469
Look, I know. Listen to me. I did, I forgot this. I'd never seen this movie. I haven't thought of

234
00:42:20,469 --> 00:42:27,030
the Da Vinci code in, I don't know, at least, at least fucking 10 years. I don't know. I never

235
00:42:27,030 --> 00:42:32,460
even care where the movie came out. I forgot like Da Vinci made the Mona Lisa and the whole thing

236
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:37,739
is about like stealing the Mona Lisa because there's a secret in it. I don't know. I don't

237
00:42:37,739 --> 00:42:54,460
know what it was. I just looked at the cover. I need a UV light. You didn't know the Mona Lisa,

238
00:42:54,460 --> 00:42:59,659
what? You didn't know the Mona Lisa was painted by Da Vinci. No, but I didn't, I guess I just

239
00:42:59,659 --> 00:43:05,739
didn't realize like that this movie in this game. Well, I don't, I don't know. I was just kind of,

240
00:43:05,739 --> 00:43:14,469
I was lost there for a second. I didn't, I know Da Vinci painted the Mona Lisa, but in my brain,

241
00:43:14,469 --> 00:43:18,469
they weren't going to start with that. Like the Mona Lisa was going to be like the big reveal at

242
00:43:18,469 --> 00:43:24,550
the end of the game. Not the first puzzle. You know what I mean? I, but I didn't, you're an iPad

243
00:43:24,550 --> 00:43:31,420
kid. I can't defend it. I can't defend it. I, I take the L. I can't defend it. This is the first

244
00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:36,059
thing they do in the movie is they go over that. I didn't see the movie. Guys, I don't even, I didn't

245
00:43:36,059 --> 00:43:48,420
care. For a second, I was blending two movies together. What's the one where Nick Cage? It's

246
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:53,539
like American treasures or something. It's like he, and he's like the constitution or what they

247
00:43:53,539 --> 00:44:04,599
both are the same movie. All right. Sneak. I don't know, dude. It's like this relic that has all these

248
00:44:04,599 --> 00:44:08,599
secrets in it. It's like the constitution had a bunch of secrets in it. The Mona Lisa has a bunch

249
00:44:08,599 --> 00:44:16,230
of secrets in it. Like Leonardo Da Vinci was a like an alien and he landed and taught everybody

250
00:44:16,230 --> 00:44:25,719
fucking technology, whatever the hell it is. I don't know. Oh, I thought there was a person

251
00:44:25,719 --> 00:44:47,530
behind a desk. I was like, why can't they not see me? What are you? What's happening?

252
00:44:51,510 --> 00:44:56,309
Why is it fighting right now? Holy shit. Stop, stop, fight, fight.

253
00:45:16,579 --> 00:45:21,699
That was an extraordinary reaction. I did not, I did not fucking think that was going to happen.

254
00:45:24,199 --> 00:45:28,840
Knocked on the floor and then they just punched me in the face over and over again.

255
00:45:31,670 --> 00:45:38,730
I didn't even know there was a combat in this game. What the hell was that?

256
00:45:43,559 --> 00:45:53,530
Dude, knock, knock. Who's that? You wouldn't even like, oh, who is that? Let me, I can't even

257
00:45:53,530 --> 00:46:07,780
identify myself first. That was, I would have, that was fucking crazy. If the officer sees me,

258
00:46:07,780 --> 00:46:17,820
he will not let me pass. I must sneak by him. Okay. This game just, you all wanted me to skip.

259
00:46:18,460 --> 00:46:29,539
We have melee combat in this game. It was one of the most ridiculous things I think I've ever

260
00:46:29,539 --> 00:46:46,039
seen in a game. Like what was the point of any of that? So far, so good. Items you can use be on

261
00:46:46,039 --> 00:46:57,059
the lookout. Okay. Can I just like take everything? Like you can pick up weapons. What do you mean?

262
00:46:57,619 --> 00:47:20,039
Where's a weapon? You need to initiate a throw during a throw. Okay. Why is this a wrestling

263
00:47:20,039 --> 00:47:25,639
game now? This is like turning into like Arkham. Defend begins when the enemy gets the upper hand

264
00:47:25,639 --> 00:47:41,750
counter the attack. When you start an attack, buttons appear at the bottom. Okay. Okay.

265
00:47:42,309 --> 00:48:00,889
Leave him alone. What? I can and will defend myself.

266
00:48:02,489 --> 00:48:09,179
Get off him. What? Stop. It's not fair. Why do I have to do a QTE every time I want to fight?

267
00:48:09,179 --> 00:48:13,530
Give me the weapon. Where's the weapon? There's supposed to be a weapon here somewhere. Where is

268
00:48:13,530 --> 00:48:41,420
it? Oh, shit. Get me the fuck out of here. Is there, how do I get a weapon? Where is this weapon that

269
00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:54,500
apparently exists? Do not make me help you. You keep walking past it. Guys, it looks like somebody

270
00:48:54,500 --> 00:49:04,440
threw up on my monitor. I can't see anything. Where do you see? Oh, shit. Where is it?

271
00:49:12,619 --> 00:49:29,769
What do you see? Is it on the ground? It's on the floor. Actually, guys, this shit burnt into the

272
00:49:29,769 --> 00:49:55,639
screen. It's hard for me to see what's going on. What was that? What's with the weird? Okay. All

273
00:49:55,639 --> 00:50:01,880
right. This time don't aggro everybody. Get the weapon. It says get the whip on and equip it.

274
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:07,639
It wasn't in French. It was just text on the screen. If the officer sees me, he will not let

275
00:50:07,639 --> 00:50:31,079
me pass. I must sneak by him. Okay. Okay. Let's go. Very nice. Keep going. Keep sneaking.

276
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:36,599
Be looking for items you can use as weapons. Be on the lookout for items you can use as weapons.

277
00:50:36,599 --> 00:50:49,449
I don't see anything I can use as a weapon. Have to knock out that officer to get to the evidence

278
00:50:49,849 --> 00:51:05,159
count. No, I don't want to see this whole fucking tutorial again. Oh, my God. Okay. All right. I

279
00:51:05,159 --> 00:51:26,619
think I see it on the ground. Yep. Okay. Let's go. How do I pick it up? How do I pick this thing up

280
00:51:26,619 --> 00:51:46,150
off the ground? Oh, my goodness. How do I? This should be useful. Okay. This could be useful to

281
00:51:46,150 --> 00:52:31,130
Knox. This just won't end. Would you really hit a lady? Get out of here. This thing sucks.

282
00:52:32,329 --> 00:52:52,860
Have you had enough? Oh, my God, dude. I hit him in the face. Everybody relax. Oh,

283
00:52:55,909 --> 00:53:11,750
what? This fight is going on way too long, man. I will use force if necessary. We have been.

284
00:53:12,550 --> 00:53:30,329
I hope he will be all right. This looks useful. Wait, drag his body? To where? Why would I want

285
00:53:30,329 --> 00:53:42,579
to drag him anywhere? There's nowhere I can put him. All right. Let's go. I got a weapon.

286
00:53:43,639 --> 00:53:51,880
And now I need to look at the evidence area, right? Examine, please. I'd like to examine

287
00:53:51,880 --> 00:54:10,230
that evidence. Hey, not working. Maybe I can't have a weapon in my hand. What are you doing?

288
00:54:10,230 --> 00:54:17,380
Get out of there. I cannot satiate my bloodlust. Wait, why did I drop it?

289
00:54:30,039 --> 00:54:41,750
That's so unfair. Can I just go into the evidence cabinet now, please? Nope. You can't be in

290
00:54:41,750 --> 00:54:50,570
anything. Oh, shit. All right. I'm going to beat the shit out of these guys now. I am pissed off.

291
00:54:50,570 --> 00:55:23,269
I am done. I am pissed off. I'm ready to. This is it. I thought I heard something.

292
00:55:28,840 --> 00:56:32,309
Are they both right here? How do I knock? Got it. First try. First try. There you are. Robert,

293
00:56:32,309 --> 00:56:37,110
I told you to get out of here. If I. Where were you? I had to get the black light. If my

294
00:56:37,110 --> 00:56:40,869
grandfather left me a message. I can't believe I fucked with that. I thought I told you to leave.

295
00:56:40,869 --> 00:56:45,269
Why did Senor write my name on the floor? Oh, my God. I'm never going to live that down.

296
00:56:46,469 --> 00:56:50,630
The letters PS may mean Princess Sophie, but do they mean anything else to you?

297
00:56:51,510 --> 00:56:57,429
Anything at all? Yes. I saw the initials PS once when I was very young. Sophie,

298
00:56:58,150 --> 00:57:01,909
this one hasn't been out in over 10 years. The initials appeared with a symbol,

299
00:57:02,550 --> 00:57:07,590
a fleur-de-lis. How could you possibly know that? I'm fairly certain your grandfather was a member

300
00:57:07,590 --> 00:57:12,630
of a secret society. The fleur-de-lis combined with the initials PS, that is the Brotherhood's

301
00:57:12,630 --> 00:57:18,789
official coat of arms. They call themselves the Priory of Scion. The Priory's membership has

302
00:57:18,789 --> 00:57:25,269
included some of history's most cultured individuals. Men like Botticelli, Sir Isaac

303
00:57:25,269 --> 00:57:34,739
Newton, Victor Hugo, and more importantly, Leonardo da Vinci. The identities of living

304
00:57:34,739 --> 00:57:40,900
My jaw hurts. That was like snapping. But the PS and fleur-de-lis that you saw as a child

305
00:57:40,900 --> 00:57:45,940
would make sense if tonight were Priory related. There is a lot we need to discuss,

306
00:57:45,940 --> 00:57:48,579
but I cannot afford to let them capture you, Robert.

307
00:57:48,579 --> 00:57:53,139
Sonier obviously brought us together for a reason. I'm staying until we figure this out.

308
00:57:55,079 --> 00:58:00,760
Fine, then help me. My grandfather wanted us to see this painting for a reason.

309
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:06,280
There must be a message hidden here. It smells like alcohol. Where have I smelled that before?

310
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:16,489
I thought he was implying that I was like drunk. No, not it. What is this?

311
00:58:17,130 --> 00:58:28,409
Pfft. Why can I see this? What do you see? Random symbols in my face. You see random symbols?

312
00:58:28,409 --> 00:58:31,050
Yes, yes, lots of them. This one looks like a P. This one looks like an E.

313
00:58:37,670 --> 00:58:43,130
Nice phlegm. Okay, it's going to be like of...

314
00:59:01,110 --> 00:59:07,829
They obviously are not random symbols. They're arranged. Yes, it does. This is somebody...

315
00:59:11,079 --> 00:59:20,380
Okay, so now what am I supposed to do about this? How do I solve this? Do I have to like highlight

316
00:59:20,380 --> 00:59:28,780
ones that match or something? Do I have to highlight the whole thing? All right,

317
00:59:28,780 --> 00:59:34,010
maybe I have to just light up everything. Like just highlight it. Highlighting, highlighting,

318
00:59:34,570 --> 00:59:45,380
highlighting. Highlighting every word. Highlighting every word. Oh shit.

319
01:00:15,019 --> 01:00:21,099
Guys, I've done my fair share of the back of the Cocoa Puffs box. You don't think I know

320
01:00:21,179 --> 01:00:26,539
how to do this flawlessly? Do you know how many Captain Crunch boxes I've been through in my day?

321
01:00:38,539 --> 01:01:14,659
E. B? We? That's definitely E's. That's definitely a P. I'm gonna say we. We was A, right? There's

322
01:01:14,659 --> 01:01:31,989
gonna be a lot of As. This could be A. That could be A. This is probably A. One, two, three, four,

323
01:01:32,150 --> 01:01:46,039
five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. Okay. One, two, three, four, five, six, A, B, C, D, E. That's F.

324
01:01:55,429 --> 01:02:01,269
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck. What did it mean? It's like he wrote this

325
01:02:01,269 --> 01:02:14,170
when they were like bashing the door down to come get him. What's the code though? What's

326
01:02:14,170 --> 01:02:25,179
the Da Vinci code? I'm gonna solve it right now. Well, I was wondering if you had anything specific

327
01:02:25,179 --> 01:02:31,219
to tell me about this encrypted message. As you can see, this symbol is the most common one.

328
01:02:31,860 --> 01:02:43,000
As a result, I believe it is the letter E. That's what I said. Wait, what's? It's this one. This is E.

329
01:02:44,630 --> 01:02:49,110
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. Anything come up more than 10 times?

330
01:02:49,829 --> 01:02:56,250
That's what I was saying. I had the formula, right? We just gotta find where A is, right?

331
01:02:57,050 --> 01:03:04,969
How am I supposed to? How would you ever do this? Okay, this is E. This is maybe like of

332
01:03:06,119 --> 01:03:41,980
or like two of. This is probably T. Whoa, the, that, that, that, these, that, and, the, the, what?

333
01:03:42,860 --> 01:03:59,860
Painting, painted, I, there's something painted those, the, those, these are probably those.

334
01:04:00,500 --> 01:04:45,460
I've painted those that lies, lies and lies painted those that be tween, between, between

335
01:04:45,460 --> 01:05:01,320
those that knew, knew between. This is wrong. It's not D. Maybe it is. Do. Wait, what? Oh,

336
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:08,360
it's Da Vinci. Miss Da Vinci. I'm thinking like, I don't know. It's just relax. Relax, relax, relax.

337
01:05:08,360 --> 01:05:15,559
Da Vinci painted those that knew. All right. Listen, I'm reading it like the painted to

338
01:05:15,559 --> 01:05:23,500
something like the. Oh my God. What's wrong with my brain today? I must be tired or something. I am

339
01:05:23,579 --> 01:05:37,110
probably tired. Da Vinci painted those that knew between Bacchus, Bacchus,

340
01:05:40,309 --> 01:05:58,280
between Bacchus and lies the clue. But what's this? You Da Vinci painted those that knew between

341
01:05:58,280 --> 01:06:21,800
Bacchus and you're, you're Yu-Gi-Oh. Oh, I got it. Hey, you want to look behind the painting.

342
01:06:24,460 --> 01:06:32,380
Nice. Bacchus is the God of wine and Uriel is an angel. If I'm not mistaken, there is a painting

343
01:06:32,380 --> 01:06:36,780
of Bacchus. He forgot it was the Da Vinci game again. I keep forgetting Madonna of the rocks,

344
01:06:36,780 --> 01:06:42,539
which should be in there too. Let's go. I keep forgetting. This is a Da Vinci game. Wait,

345
01:06:43,099 --> 01:06:48,940
Robert is innocent. He did not murder Sonia. Asian Navoo. Innocent or not. I have direct orders to

346
01:06:48,940 --> 01:06:53,739
arrest Robert Langdon on site. I'm sorry, but I can't go to jail until I helped Sophie find

347
01:06:53,739 --> 01:07:03,820
the real murderer. You are working together. Robert, look out. What the? It would be best if

348
01:07:03,820 --> 01:07:24,550
you would let me go. Ow. Was it this much fighting in the movie? All right. Take him.

349
01:07:24,550 --> 01:07:35,380
You take him. Told me boxing wouldn't be useful in a teaching career. Where do we put him? Who

350
01:07:35,380 --> 01:07:47,269
cares? All right. We got what we needed. Oh my God. Now, now let's go. Search the Bacchus,

351
01:07:48,230 --> 01:08:33,050
Uriel and John. Where the hell is this painting? It's actually, it's pretty dark. I can't really

352
01:08:33,050 --> 01:08:41,260
see. That means you guys can't see. I need to turn this up. I need to make this a little brighter.

353
01:08:41,260 --> 01:08:57,430
Hold on. Give me one sec. It's dark. How many of this helps? Does that make this better or worse?

354
01:08:57,510 --> 01:09:03,670
Actually, kind of worse. And the game's just supposed to be like this. Yeah, the game's

355
01:09:03,670 --> 01:09:17,619
just supposed to be like this. Okay, so where is this painting? I gotta find like three things.

356
01:09:18,260 --> 01:09:36,729
Oh, wait a minute. Saturn's sphere. And okay, so I have one of the planets. I have no idea which

357
01:09:36,729 --> 01:09:40,090
one of these is the right painting considering that they're all so hard to even decipher what

358
01:09:40,090 --> 01:09:59,609
they are. Is it just not even in this room? Oh, I thought it wanted me to do it in here.

359
01:09:59,609 --> 01:10:05,859
Well, I don't see anything special. Everyone seems to be pointing at something now. Bacchus

360
01:10:05,859 --> 01:10:10,819
points to the right and Uriel points to the left. In between them we have John the Baptist and he's

361
01:10:10,819 --> 01:11:09,380
pointing up. What does that mean? There's something up there. What? On the painting above John the

362
01:11:09,380 --> 01:11:25,800
Baptist. Give me a boost. Maybe I can reach it. I was seeing if she was gonna fall. Back in the day

363
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:51,130
when they were just QTEs for no reason. Zero. You gotta make it harder than that.

364
01:11:57,319 --> 01:12:04,220
I thought one of the paintings is ringing. It's like wait, inside the painting is like a painting

365
01:12:04,220 --> 01:12:12,069
of a phone but it's a real phone. Hello. That would have been fucking cool. Imagine like one

366
01:12:12,069 --> 01:12:15,829
of these there was a phone and you could reach it and it was actually it was a real phone.

367
01:12:17,079 --> 01:12:24,920
Why would you not do that? And it was like embedded in the paint and it was flush with the paint and

368
01:12:24,920 --> 01:12:28,680
painting. So it was just like what the fuck am I looking at? Hey, wait a minute. You reach it and

369
01:12:28,680 --> 01:12:38,869
it's like a phone. I would be so much better at this. Where somebody's office was ringing.

370
01:12:39,510 --> 01:12:54,659
Where's this person's office? I wasn't even looking. Like an office telephone is ringing

371
01:12:54,659 --> 01:13:02,470
and it was like oh look it's this way but I wasn't even I wasn't even looking. Down here?

372
01:13:03,189 --> 01:13:11,699
You didn't pay any attention? No, zero. Like absolutely just as close to zero as you can get.

373
01:13:13,270 --> 01:13:13,670
Down here?

374
01:13:57,560 --> 01:14:31,180
What? This is my grandfather's office. Maybe we can find a clue here.

375
01:14:34,229 --> 01:14:36,069
I'm just standing here.

376
01:14:46,760 --> 01:14:53,590
Wait what? That's you talking here but you're standing here. How could you be in there and out

377
01:14:53,590 --> 01:15:03,609
here? Wait that's not her talking?

378
01:15:09,369 --> 01:15:16,920
I thought that was I thought she left a message and that's how they found out that

379
01:15:17,479 --> 01:15:28,279
I got the bug. How high are you? I'm not. Just relax. I'm not. I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine right

380
01:15:28,279 --> 01:15:44,069
now. I'm not high. I haven't had any marijuana cigarettes in like at all. I'm not. I'm kidding

381
01:15:44,069 --> 01:15:48,069
around. It might be another clue to Sonier's involvement with the Priory of Scion

382
01:15:48,069 --> 01:15:54,949
or perhaps the Priory's involvement with the Louvre. Okay so let's take a look. Take a look

383
01:15:54,949 --> 01:16:02,180
at this. It's research on where all the Fleurs de Lis are in the Louvre. It might be another clue

384
01:16:02,180 --> 01:16:07,060
to Sonier's involvement with the Priory of Scion or perhaps the Priory's involvement with the Louvre.

385
01:16:09,539 --> 01:16:20,970
Interesting. Okay. Nothing else. Take a look at this. Okay. What about what's on the

386
01:16:20,970 --> 01:16:28,569
computer? A special laptop used by police for crime scene investigation. Okay. Oh wait a minute.

387
01:16:28,569 --> 01:16:34,039
This night has been moved recently. The dust has disturbed around the edges. I think grandfather

388
01:16:34,039 --> 01:16:45,699
moved it so the lance would point us towards something. So excited. This map of the Louvre.

389
01:16:46,420 --> 01:16:53,739
It smells. It smells like alcohol. It smells. Map of the Louvre. This map of the Louvre.

390
01:16:54,380 --> 01:17:05,720
It smells like alcohol. Okay. But it. So what? There's a phone on the map.

391
01:17:06,520 --> 01:17:21,300
This map of the Louvre. This map has been drinking. Okay. But so boring as fuck just like the book.

392
01:17:23,670 --> 01:17:47,029
Come on. What do you mean all these trues? True, true, true. It's a novel.

393
01:17:47,829 --> 01:18:01,300
Boring as fuck. Book sucks. It's probably good, isn't it? All right. So what's a good book?

394
01:18:02,020 --> 01:18:11,050
What's a good book? Can chat agree on some nominees for what a good book is? Okay. Well,

395
01:18:11,050 --> 01:18:24,939
I don't know what else to do here. It smells like alcohol. Search the office. I did. Can we get some

396
01:18:24,939 --> 01:18:38,460
Apollo up here? Okay. I see the Bible, Green Eggs and Ham, Dante's Inferno, and Dune. All right.

397
01:18:38,460 --> 01:18:45,829
Pick between those four. What? What? What? What's your favorite book? What's your favorite? Well,

398
01:18:45,829 --> 01:18:52,220
not with the Bible. Put the Bible in there. No, those three. Those returning the Bible.

399
01:18:55,819 --> 01:19:16,569
Large bookshelf containing many books. It's probably like a right. No event seems to connect

400
01:19:16,569 --> 01:19:29,380
to the adjacent room. Can we get up there? How do we get up there? This map of the Louvre.

401
01:19:30,819 --> 01:19:36,619
How do we get up to the vent? Can we move a chair? Do I need a ladder? Bring a ladder back in here?

402
01:19:37,590 --> 01:19:41,189
How much of a point and click adventure game does this game want to be versus how much is

403
01:19:41,189 --> 01:19:45,989
it actually? Right? Like, do I need to go get a ladder and bring it back into this room?

404
01:20:03,289 --> 01:20:12,260
UV light. Okay. All right. All right. So, so it's, it's okay. So it's a, I just didn't know. I didn't

405
01:20:12,260 --> 01:20:14,739
know if it was like a go to your inventory. Like point and click. Okay. What's this?

406
01:20:15,380 --> 01:20:26,779
What do we need to know? Okay. Wait. He circled his office. No, look closer. It is the room next

407
01:20:26,779 --> 01:20:32,539
door. The restoration room. There is a vent up above. If you boost me up to it, maybe I can get

408
01:20:32,539 --> 01:20:38,699
to the other side. Oh, wait. Yeah. We're doing a poll. What was the poll again? It was, what's your

409
01:20:38,699 --> 01:20:58,380
favorite book? What's a book that you consider to read? I have to tap every time. What were the

410
01:20:58,380 --> 01:21:06,939
options? Um, uh, green eggs and ham. Do you need to search around some more? Dune. Maybe we can find

411
01:21:06,939 --> 01:21:23,220
a clue here. The Bible and what was the other one? I said there was a fourth one. What was it? Oh,

412
01:21:23,220 --> 01:21:27,699
Dante's Inferno. Yeah. Okay. There you go. What do you, do you like any of those? Chemistry isn't

413
01:21:27,699 --> 01:21:37,579
my strong suit. Me neither. What do you think this table is used for? Oh God. I can't even read this.

414
01:21:37,579 --> 01:21:45,909
There must be instructions for this somewhere. I'm making a, we just just chug it.

415
01:21:47,340 --> 01:21:58,760
Lactose. Okay. Well, I don't know. We'll figure that out. What's this?

416
01:22:00,659 --> 01:22:10,840
Best book of all time. What do we got? Green eggs and ham. Dude, it's so funny how Dune is the lowest

417
01:22:10,840 --> 01:22:29,989
of all of these. So green eggs and ham is just absolutely sweeping right now. Okay. The Bible

418
01:22:29,989 --> 01:22:39,050
is in second. Best book of all time. Green eggs and ham more, more important than the Bible.

419
01:22:40,920 --> 01:22:48,090
Bible way more important than Dune. Also Bible more important than Dante's Inferno. Two religious

420
01:22:48,090 --> 01:22:53,770
books up here. Well, one of them is a religious book. The other one is a take on the religious

421
01:22:53,770 --> 01:23:03,060
text, right? How is Dante's Inferno not higher? Those books are terrible. Dante's Inferno. I

422
01:23:03,060 --> 01:23:09,340
remember, I remember reading Dante's Inferno and just being like, what's going on here?

423
01:23:10,539 --> 01:23:21,260
What the fuck? How many of you guys just haven't even read Dante's Inferno? Green eggs and ham.

424
01:23:21,260 --> 01:23:37,590
Okay. All right. Dante's Inferno. What was it? Dante's Inferno is a... I haven't read any of these.

425
01:23:37,590 --> 01:23:48,100
What? You've never read green eggs and ham? You had to have. You've never read green eggs.

426
01:23:48,100 --> 01:23:58,729
I think this might be the only one of the four that a lot of you have read. That's the one I know.

427
01:23:58,729 --> 01:24:06,569
Can I get a towel? All right. We are way over, over our time limit on this one.

428
01:24:06,569 --> 01:24:10,819
I did, this was very fun, but I'm going to do one or two more puzzles and then I'm moving on.

429
01:24:10,819 --> 01:24:23,289
I cannot make out what the painting is supposed to depict. Maybe we can remove the dirt.

430
01:24:23,850 --> 01:24:38,500
Finish it. Dirty painting with the towel. I cannot make out what the painting is supposed to depict.

431
01:24:38,500 --> 01:24:48,060
Maybe we can remove the dirt. Use the, use it. Rinse it in the sink. I don't actually have to do

432
01:24:48,060 --> 01:25:03,770
that, do I? Anything else in here? This one's cool. I like this one. I like this one. Box is empty.

433
01:25:04,329 --> 01:25:14,489
There's nothing out of the ordinary about these books. What book? Nothing there. What's your

434
01:25:14,489 --> 01:25:25,340
favorite? What's your favorite book? What's your favorite Xbox game of all time? I never had one.

435
01:25:26,380 --> 01:25:34,060
I've never had an Xbox before. Original. New game, please. I will. Let me just get past this.

436
01:25:39,020 --> 01:25:42,699
Enzyme that functions in the defense against fungal and insect pathogens.

437
01:25:43,260 --> 01:25:48,199
Commonly used as a counter enzyme that neutralizes supercharged oxygen molecules.

438
01:25:51,180 --> 01:25:55,979
It neutralizes supercharged oxygen molecules called superoxide radicals.

439
01:25:55,979 --> 01:26:01,479
You don't want those on your counter. I mean, pretty good cleaning.

440
01:26:02,810 --> 01:26:09,609
Involved in the hydrolysis of lactose to constitute galactose and glucose.

441
01:26:10,409 --> 01:26:15,529
Its functions include catalyzing the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen.

442
01:26:16,170 --> 01:26:23,210
An enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of urea into carbon dioxide and ammonia.

443
01:26:23,210 --> 01:26:26,920
I'm just going to pick two until I get it right.

444
01:26:27,640 --> 01:27:12,380
A speaker of enzyme should clean the painting. I cannot make out what the painting is.

445
01:27:13,260 --> 01:27:15,579
Toilet sounds. It kind of was toilet sounds.

446
01:27:16,220 --> 01:27:20,949
It seems to be working, but I think we need to spread the enzymes around.

447
01:27:21,909 --> 01:27:32,100
You ruined it! That was a weird look.

448
01:27:34,380 --> 01:27:37,449
What is that?

449
01:27:38,170 --> 01:27:42,090
The winged victory of Samothrace. That's here in the Louvre.

450
01:27:42,090 --> 01:27:44,409
But why would Sarnier want us to go there?

451
01:27:44,409 --> 01:27:46,010
How many books have you read in the last year?

452
01:27:46,729 --> 01:27:53,560
This is actually interesting. Yeah, right. Yeah, right.

453
01:27:55,189 --> 01:28:02,220
10 plus books in the last year. Yeah, right. I could believe between zero and five.

454
01:28:03,300 --> 01:28:09,270
10, 10 plus. Some of you mean that. Some of you are talking about like 20.

455
01:28:11,180 --> 01:28:14,569
My goal is always 100. 10 is easy.

456
01:28:15,289 --> 01:28:18,010
Some people read a lot. That's a lot.

457
01:28:18,010 --> 01:28:21,529
How many books are you reading? 10? More than 10 books a year?

458
01:28:24,840 --> 01:28:29,899
Yeah, those are 10 Dr. Seuss books.

459
01:28:29,899 --> 01:28:35,960
All right. 32% say zero. 30% say between one and two.

460
01:28:35,960 --> 01:28:39,340
Wow, we have to read more, don't we?

461
01:28:39,340 --> 01:28:43,819
A majority of people in this chat right now, I'm included in this.

462
01:28:44,819 --> 01:28:50,409
62% of us, at least out of the sample size that I chose to answer,

463
01:28:50,409 --> 01:28:58,939
have only read under two books in the whole year. Sometimes less than one.

464
01:28:58,939 --> 01:29:03,670
The last time I've read a book was Game of Thrones.

465
01:29:03,670 --> 01:29:12,180
It was the Game of Thrones book. It has to be the last Game of Thrones book.

466
01:29:12,180 --> 01:29:23,289
What about audiobooks? I think those count.

467
01:29:23,289 --> 01:29:28,060
It's the only book you've read. Name 10 books.

468
01:29:31,579 --> 01:29:33,529
That's not fair, though.

469
01:29:33,529 --> 01:29:39,670
That's actually not fair because I don't pay attention to that world really at all.

470
01:29:39,670 --> 01:29:44,579
Name 10 books. Dr. Seuss.

471
01:29:44,579 --> 01:29:57,260
Rain, Eggs, and Ham. The Great Gatsby.

472
01:29:57,260 --> 01:30:20,359
Um, The Shining. The Catcher in the Rye.

473
01:30:20,359 --> 01:30:22,119
The Twilight series.

474
01:30:26,569 --> 01:30:37,079
Okay, Twilight. I don't want to look at chat. I don't want any help.

475
01:30:37,079 --> 01:30:40,119
A Song of Ice and Fire. Book one.

476
01:30:40,119 --> 01:30:43,539
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. How about this?

477
01:30:43,539 --> 01:30:46,010
Book five. A Dance of Dragons.

478
01:30:46,010 --> 01:31:07,430
Okay, that's five. That's six.

479
01:31:07,430 --> 01:31:16,100
Tempest. Let me do it. Let me do it.

480
01:31:16,100 --> 01:31:18,779
Let me do it. He's thinking so.

481
01:31:18,779 --> 01:31:21,420
I was thinking of a relevant book that I may have even read or heard of.

482
01:31:23,640 --> 01:31:34,579
The Tempest. Um, I mean, everything is a book.

483
01:31:34,579 --> 01:31:37,829
I could just name anything. Lord of the Rings.

484
01:31:37,829 --> 01:31:42,090
I mean, The Hobbit. Lord of the Rings.

485
01:31:42,090 --> 01:31:54,789
And that's like 15. What do you mean not a book?

486
01:31:54,789 --> 01:31:57,750
Eight? That's four. That's not four.

487
01:31:57,750 --> 01:32:09,220
That's not four. Uh, you know what?

488
01:32:09,220 --> 01:32:14,170
I'm just going to name a random movie.

489
01:32:14,170 --> 01:32:18,380
And my Big Fat Greek Wedding. Is that a book?

490
01:32:18,380 --> 01:32:21,659
That's a book, right? That's a book, right?

491
01:32:21,979 --> 01:32:27,609
That's a book. Was that a book first?

492
01:32:27,609 --> 01:32:32,119
Like, I kind of feel like it was. Is it not?

493
01:32:32,119 --> 01:32:39,210
I'm thinking of like, okay, movies that like were books.

494
01:32:39,210 --> 01:32:47,100
Dune. Titanic. A screenplay is not a book.

495
01:32:47,100 --> 01:32:50,279
Technically, it was.

496
01:32:50,279 --> 01:32:52,810
James and the Giant Peach. How's that?

497
01:32:52,810 --> 01:32:56,869
That's been at least 10.

498
01:32:56,869 --> 01:33:05,340
The Titanic. No, somebody said that in chat

499
01:33:05,340 --> 01:33:07,500
and I said it out loud. I didn't say that.

500
01:33:07,500 --> 01:33:10,869
I was laughing. No, the Titanic.

501
01:33:10,869 --> 01:33:12,949
Okay, I need to defend myself here.

502
01:33:12,949 --> 01:33:15,029
Somebody said the Titanic. Like, 10 of you said it.

503
01:33:15,029 --> 01:33:16,710
And I was reading the chat room.

504
01:33:16,710 --> 01:33:18,710
Going, the Titanic? Like, what the fuck?

505
01:33:18,710 --> 01:33:22,550
The Titanic was not a book first.

506
01:33:22,550 --> 01:33:25,350
Oh my god. You guys are, you guys are, I'm being, I'm,

507
01:33:25,350 --> 01:33:27,350
you guys are, you guys are attacking me.

508
01:33:27,350 --> 01:33:33,800
Play the game? How many of you guys actually care

509
01:33:33,800 --> 01:33:35,159
about me playing the game? I thought it was like,

510
01:33:35,159 --> 01:33:37,159
don't play the game, play the other one.

511
01:33:39,750 --> 01:33:42,789
You cannot honestly believe that I thought the Titanic

512
01:33:42,789 --> 01:33:46,069
was a book before it was a horrific thing

513
01:33:46,069 --> 01:33:47,189
that happened in the world.

514
01:33:47,189 --> 01:33:48,869
You can and will defend myself.

515
01:33:48,869 --> 01:33:49,430
What's going on?

516
01:33:50,149 --> 01:34:01,020
This isn't necessary.

517
01:34:01,899 --> 01:34:05,989
The book is actually what was based on the,

518
01:34:05,989 --> 01:34:07,270
okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, hold on.

519
01:34:07,270 --> 01:34:07,989
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

520
01:34:07,989 --> 01:34:09,989
We need to make sure that we get this clear here.

521
01:34:10,890 --> 01:34:15,720
The movie, The Titanic was, was it based off of a book

522
01:34:15,720 --> 01:34:17,079
of the telling of that story?

523
01:34:17,079 --> 01:34:18,279
Move them out of sight.

524
01:34:18,279 --> 01:34:26,840
So they just made that up.

525
01:34:26,840 --> 01:34:28,840
Okay, I just, I'm just, we're just checking.

526
01:34:28,840 --> 01:34:38,920
It could be the movie that's, this isn't important.

527
01:34:38,920 --> 01:34:39,800
A lot of you know what I mean.

528
01:34:40,600 --> 01:34:43,479
Like, Titanic, the movie, was it like a retelling

529
01:34:43,479 --> 01:34:45,239
of like a book version of the Titanic

530
01:34:45,239 --> 01:34:46,439
where those characters were in it?

531
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:52,890
I don't think this is relevant.

532
01:34:55,880 --> 01:34:57,319
It's historical fiction.

533
01:34:58,039 --> 01:34:58,680
That's what I'm saying.

534
01:34:58,680 --> 01:35:00,359
Was there like a Titanic book?

535
01:35:04,069 --> 01:35:05,510
All right, I'm playing a different game.

536
01:35:06,149 --> 01:35:17,819
I think that great wedding.

537
01:35:17,819 --> 01:35:18,220
I don't know.

538
01:35:18,220 --> 01:35:20,699
I figured like maybe that's a, maybe it was a book.

539
01:35:20,699 --> 01:35:24,699
No, the Titanic is a real thing.

540
01:35:24,699 --> 01:35:25,579
Oh my God.

541
01:35:25,579 --> 01:35:26,460
How do I get out of this?

542
01:35:27,020 --> 01:35:27,739
How do I get out of this?

543
01:35:27,739 --> 01:35:30,460
How do I like, how do I get, how do I take the car

544
01:35:30,460 --> 01:35:32,140
and like slowly get off the exit

545
01:35:32,140 --> 01:35:34,060
and like get us off this highway?

546
01:35:34,060 --> 01:35:34,939
You know what I mean?

547
01:35:34,939 --> 01:35:39,590
All right, the next one coming up

548
01:35:39,590 --> 01:35:41,750
is going to be in the same world, I think.

549
01:35:42,390 --> 01:35:55,000
And I, wait, there is, there are Titanic books.

550
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:58,970
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

551
01:35:58,970 --> 01:36:05,609
We have a paragraph, Andy here.

552
01:36:05,609 --> 01:36:10,899
The film based on the book and with advice from the Lord

553
01:36:11,699 --> 01:36:13,619
was released in 1958.

554
01:36:13,619 --> 01:36:15,380
Lord also served as a consultant

555
01:36:15,380 --> 01:36:17,539
to Canadian film director James Cameron

556
01:36:17,539 --> 01:36:19,779
while he was making the film Titanic.

557
01:36:19,779 --> 01:36:21,939
That is precisely what I'm talking about.

558
01:36:21,939 --> 01:36:24,020
That is precisely what I was talking about.

559
01:36:24,020 --> 01:36:25,619
I'm so glad we get to turn off the exit now.

560
01:36:26,329 --> 01:36:28,649
Yes, it was, somebody wrote a book.

561
01:36:30,329 --> 01:36:32,409
You just got back on the highway.

562
01:36:32,409 --> 01:36:34,250
Somebody wrote a book based on this

563
01:36:34,250 --> 01:36:37,020
and that's what the movie was based on.

564
01:36:37,020 --> 01:36:38,699
I, you know, I might say things

565
01:36:38,699 --> 01:36:41,340
completely fucked up sometimes, but you know what I mean.

566
01:36:41,340 --> 01:36:46,619
Coming up next is Stolen.

567
01:36:46,619 --> 01:37:01,579
The film based on the book with advice from Lord

568
01:37:01,579 --> 01:37:02,539
was released in 1958.

569
01:37:02,539 --> 01:37:06,140
Lord also served as consultant to, so somebody wrote a book

570
01:37:06,140 --> 01:37:09,260
and then they consulted on the movie about Titanic,

571
01:37:09,260 --> 01:37:11,109
about like that happening.

572
01:37:11,109 --> 01:37:14,119
Okay, like the story that he wrote.

573
01:37:14,500 --> 01:37:15,539
All right, sounds good.

574
01:37:15,539 --> 01:37:17,939
Um, I think the Xbox is wrong with it.

575
01:37:17,939 --> 01:37:24,439
No, not the Lord, Lord?

576
01:37:24,439 --> 01:37:26,760
Did somebody write something named Lord?

577
01:37:32,229 --> 01:37:32,630
There we go.

578
01:37:32,630 --> 01:37:34,229
Okay, I thought the disc was broken or something.

579
01:37:42,140 --> 01:37:43,979
Everyone else disagrees with you and that guy.

580
01:37:45,180 --> 01:37:56,579
At least I got one, one person here that can help me.

581
01:37:56,579 --> 01:38:01,590
This game is called Stolen.

582
01:38:01,590 --> 01:38:02,310
No, I agree.

583
01:38:02,310 --> 01:38:02,949
I exist.

584
01:38:02,949 --> 01:38:03,590
I'm here.

585
01:38:24,310 --> 01:38:26,949
Oh, the goofy movie was the book before it was the movie.

586
01:38:51,210 --> 01:38:52,729
There was a, wait, what's happening?

587
01:38:53,210 --> 01:38:55,609
I feel like we're getting the whole movie spoiled by the trailer.

588
01:39:23,659 --> 01:39:24,699
They're doing it.

589
01:39:24,699 --> 01:39:25,420
They're doing it.

590
01:39:25,420 --> 01:39:26,060
They're doing it.

591
01:39:26,060 --> 01:39:26,619
They're doing it.

592
01:39:26,619 --> 01:39:31,020
I get to, they're doing it.

593
01:39:31,020 --> 01:39:38,170
I need to calm down because they're doing it.

594
01:39:38,170 --> 01:39:39,750
Okay, I'm going to relax.

595
01:39:39,750 --> 01:39:44,039
I didn't want to do that.

596
01:39:44,039 --> 01:39:47,289
I don't, what did I just do?

597
01:39:47,289 --> 01:39:52,500
Why am I doing this right now?

598
01:39:52,500 --> 01:39:52,899
What's that?

599
01:39:52,899 --> 01:39:53,380
What am I doing?

600
01:40:04,729 --> 01:40:05,210
Silent.

601
01:40:09,180 --> 01:40:10,220
This could be a scorn like.

602
01:40:10,220 --> 01:40:11,100
Good evening.

603
01:40:11,100 --> 01:40:12,699
I'm Jacqueline Meadows.

604
01:40:12,699 --> 01:40:14,539
Tonight's top news story.

605
01:40:14,539 --> 01:40:18,060
The heat is rising in the run-up to the city's elections.

606
01:40:18,619 --> 01:40:21,659
Earlier today, Mayor Thomas Morgan made a public appearance

607
01:40:21,659 --> 01:40:25,899
at the Metropolitan Art Museum's Japanese Treasures opening.

608
01:40:25,899 --> 01:40:30,539
And once I'm re-elected, we'll bring more international

609
01:40:30,539 --> 01:40:33,500
treasures like this one to Ford City.

610
01:40:35,800 --> 01:40:39,079
While the mayor's main rival, candidate Richard Killian,

611
01:40:39,079 --> 01:40:42,760
unveiled his anti-crime platform in a televised address.

612
01:40:43,560 --> 01:40:48,279
For years, crime thrived under Morgan's reign, but no more.

613
01:40:57,350 --> 01:41:00,630
I don't know about you, but I hate this city.

614
01:41:01,590 --> 01:41:06,390
It's cold, it's dirty, it's home to far more sinners than saints.

615
01:41:08,300 --> 01:41:10,060
Myself among them, truth be told.

616
01:41:11,500 --> 01:41:13,340
Yeah, they say things are about to change.

617
01:41:13,979 --> 01:41:17,739
20 years now, I've been hearing the same thing again and again.

618
01:41:19,420 --> 01:41:21,020
But nothing ever changes.

619
01:41:21,020 --> 01:41:23,579
Same old victims, same old crimes.

620
01:41:25,180 --> 01:41:26,939
That's an endless problem.

621
01:41:26,939 --> 01:41:29,420
Unless that is, you happen to be the problem.

622
01:41:38,539 --> 01:42:00,520
Wait, is this that guy's apartment?

623
01:42:03,210 --> 01:42:04,409
Good of you to drop in.

624
01:42:05,050 --> 01:42:05,930
So what kept you?

625
01:42:06,489 --> 01:42:08,329
Just a little pest problem.

626
01:42:08,329 --> 01:42:09,449
What can I say?

627
01:42:09,449 --> 01:42:10,569
I'm a popular girl.

628
01:42:11,369 --> 01:42:11,930
All done.

629
01:42:12,970 --> 01:42:14,489
I thought those were all screens.

630
01:42:14,489 --> 01:42:15,449
It's gonna work this time?

631
01:42:15,449 --> 01:42:16,170
It's just a window?

632
01:42:16,170 --> 01:42:18,569
It'll work fine until you break it.

633
01:42:20,250 --> 01:42:21,909
Wish me luck.

634
01:42:40,569 --> 01:42:41,369
All right, let's do it.

635
01:42:43,100 --> 01:42:43,600
Whoa!

636
01:42:44,140 --> 01:42:56,439
Okay, there's that.

637
01:42:56,439 --> 01:42:57,079
There's a crouch.

638
01:42:57,640 --> 01:42:59,479
There's a punch.

639
01:43:04,260 --> 01:43:06,100
Press A to go across gaps.

640
01:43:13,779 --> 01:43:16,340
Run at the...

641
01:43:16,340 --> 01:43:23,829
Stop that, okay?

642
01:43:23,829 --> 01:43:25,829
Swing and jump off a pole to the opposite roof.

643
01:43:32,789 --> 01:43:45,960
My god, this is crazy.

644
01:43:47,340 --> 01:43:48,140
All right.

645
01:43:53,130 --> 01:43:53,609
Press...

646
01:43:53,609 --> 01:43:55,449
Oh, I didn't see that.

647
01:43:55,449 --> 01:43:56,170
What did it say?

648
01:43:56,170 --> 01:43:59,399
Press and hold R to run up the wall.

649
01:44:01,189 --> 01:44:07,000
Oh, press...

650
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:10,300
It's kind of hard to read.

651
01:44:10,300 --> 01:44:13,449
Press A after jumping at the pole to swing off it immediately.

652
01:44:16,890 --> 01:44:17,390
Nice.

653
01:44:20,819 --> 01:44:22,180
This seems pretty sick.

654
01:44:22,180 --> 01:44:26,649
This seems pretty good.

655
01:44:26,649 --> 01:44:29,050
I start to view the objectives screen.

656
01:44:29,050 --> 01:44:31,609
Left thumb stick to scroll the GPS map.

657
01:44:31,609 --> 01:44:34,970
Okay.

658
01:44:48,579 --> 01:44:49,079
Okay.

659
01:44:54,279 --> 01:44:56,890
Okay, now what?

660
01:44:56,890 --> 01:45:08,460
Pretty cool.

661
01:45:08,460 --> 01:45:31,079
Okay.

662
01:45:33,520 --> 01:45:34,640
20 FPS?

663
01:45:34,640 --> 01:45:35,680
Yeah, it's an old game.

664
01:45:36,319 --> 01:45:43,720
First person mode.

665
01:45:43,720 --> 01:45:56,060
How do I get out?

666
01:45:56,060 --> 01:45:57,520
Okay.

667
01:45:57,520 --> 01:45:59,399
Well, who cares?

668
01:45:59,399 --> 01:46:03,100
The game is quiet.

669
01:46:05,050 --> 01:46:05,770
Not anymore.

670
01:46:06,329 --> 01:46:10,350
I like those glasses.

671
01:46:19,079 --> 01:46:20,840
Use Up or Down to bring your inventory.

672
01:46:20,840 --> 01:46:22,600
Press the first person mode.

673
01:46:22,600 --> 01:46:27,869
Dude, wait a minute.

674
01:46:27,869 --> 01:46:29,390
This really is Metal Gear.

675
01:47:11,239 --> 01:47:14,909
What do I do now?

676
01:47:14,909 --> 01:47:27,159
Is he asleep?

677
01:47:27,159 --> 01:47:43,310
He's asleep standing up.

678
01:47:43,310 --> 01:47:56,060
This guy is not doing good.

679
01:47:56,060 --> 01:48:04,140
Can I take his gun?

680
01:48:04,140 --> 01:48:04,939
Okay.

681
01:48:17,100 --> 01:48:18,220
Sonic emitter.

682
01:48:18,220 --> 01:48:28,960
Press once placed to...

683
01:48:28,960 --> 01:48:32,729
Okay, how do I...

684
01:48:32,729 --> 01:48:34,329
It's very confusing to use items.

685
01:48:34,329 --> 01:48:36,409
I have to go into first person mode.

686
01:48:37,399 --> 01:48:39,399
And then I can't walk anymore.

687
01:48:39,399 --> 01:48:41,399
And then I have the sonic emitter now.

688
01:48:41,960 --> 01:48:44,489
Which there's a person over here.

689
01:48:45,840 --> 01:48:47,760
Which activate the emitter.

690
01:48:48,560 --> 01:48:52,750
Is he going to open the door?

691
01:49:12,039 --> 01:49:13,720
And it's inverted.

692
01:49:13,720 --> 01:49:25,899
He just shined the light at me.

693
01:49:25,899 --> 01:49:26,859
How did he not see me?

694
01:49:31,199 --> 01:49:31,699
Steel?

695
01:49:33,720 --> 01:49:34,220
Hey.

696
01:49:51,289 --> 01:49:52,649
Oh my god, he's just done that.

697
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:07,119
Wait, he doesn't remember?

698
01:50:07,520 --> 01:50:39,739
Just gonna say how is he missing?

699
01:50:39,739 --> 01:50:41,979
Your AI is not smart enough to hit me moving.

700
01:50:41,979 --> 01:50:42,539
Guarantee it.

701
01:50:43,100 --> 01:50:53,260
Okay.

702
01:50:53,260 --> 01:51:15,529
Oh, the framerate just got to 60.

703
01:51:15,529 --> 01:51:22,119
That's a good change.

704
01:51:26,939 --> 01:51:28,859
All this stuff must be worth a fortune.

705
01:51:29,500 --> 01:51:32,140
One of the technicians said that Jade's statue alone

706
01:51:32,140 --> 01:51:33,420
is worth more than my house.

707
01:51:34,060 --> 01:51:34,539
So what?

708
01:51:34,539 --> 01:51:35,420
I seen your house.

709
01:51:36,060 --> 01:51:38,939
All I'm saying is they should put that on display

710
01:51:38,939 --> 01:51:41,340
instead of hiding it away in the research lab.

711
01:51:41,979 --> 01:51:44,300
Yeah, but it's like really old.

712
01:51:44,300 --> 01:51:45,979
Those museum boys want to prod it

713
01:51:45,979 --> 01:51:48,060
and poke it a bit while they have the chance.

714
01:51:48,060 --> 01:51:49,340
Remember the time we were in the museum?

715
01:51:49,340 --> 01:51:50,220
Let's lock up here and get a coffee.

716
01:51:50,220 --> 01:51:51,659
And you and I got to fight.

717
01:51:51,659 --> 01:52:01,840
Are you concerned about this?

718
01:52:01,840 --> 01:52:05,819
Or is this supposed to happen?

719
01:52:05,819 --> 01:52:07,340
Oh, that's...

720
01:52:07,340 --> 01:52:15,840
Stolen.

721
01:52:15,840 --> 01:52:16,720
Lockpicking.

722
01:52:16,720 --> 01:52:50,640
Oh, that like hurts.

723
01:52:50,640 --> 01:52:52,720
Oh, I have to very lightly hold it.

724
01:52:52,720 --> 01:52:55,840
We need a new emote.

725
01:52:57,710 --> 01:52:59,550
There's like 10, 20 new emotes.

726
01:52:59,550 --> 01:53:32,840
What do you mean?

727
01:53:32,840 --> 01:53:38,060
Let's go!

728
01:53:38,060 --> 01:53:38,779
Hold to whistle.

729
01:53:38,779 --> 01:53:41,819
You might need to make the whistle.

730
01:53:41,819 --> 01:53:42,460
How do I look?

731
01:53:42,460 --> 01:53:43,500
Wait, I can scan through the...

732
01:54:14,029 --> 01:54:16,300
It's not working.

733
01:54:16,300 --> 01:54:25,239
Where's my sonar?

734
01:54:25,239 --> 01:54:28,460
Use the scan?

735
01:54:28,460 --> 01:54:43,520
Eliminate the sonic visor view.

736
01:54:44,159 --> 01:54:47,390
Or illuminate the sonic visor?

737
01:54:47,390 --> 01:54:50,399
I don't have...

738
01:54:50,399 --> 01:54:52,399
Where's my sonic visor?

739
01:54:52,399 --> 01:55:07,869
Where's the sonic visor?

740
01:55:07,869 --> 01:55:26,670
Wow.

741
01:55:26,670 --> 01:55:27,550
D-pad left?

742
01:55:30,880 --> 01:55:32,399
D-pad right is that.

743
01:55:32,399 --> 01:55:34,960
D-pad down is this.

744
01:55:34,960 --> 01:55:37,199
D-pad left doesn't seem to do anything.

745
01:55:37,199 --> 01:55:40,880
This is like zoom mode.

746
01:55:40,880 --> 01:55:41,920
This is whistle mode.

747
01:55:42,970 --> 01:55:43,930
This is punch.

748
01:55:43,930 --> 01:55:44,649
This is jump.

749
01:56:02,909 --> 01:56:14,140
I actually think that kind of helped.

750
01:56:14,140 --> 01:56:18,270
Sneak up behind this guard

751
01:56:18,270 --> 01:56:20,189
and while standing press X to put him in choke hold.

752
01:56:20,189 --> 01:56:26,670
Why am I moving so slow?

753
01:56:26,670 --> 01:56:27,390
What are you doing?

754
01:56:27,390 --> 01:56:28,109
Hurry up!

755
01:56:28,109 --> 01:56:45,470
I snuck up and pressed X.

756
01:56:45,470 --> 01:56:57,239
Oh, while standing.

757
01:56:57,239 --> 01:56:57,800
Right, right.

758
01:56:57,800 --> 01:56:58,279
Whatever.

759
01:56:58,279 --> 01:57:00,510
Stole that.

760
01:57:02,250 --> 01:57:10,489
Anything else in here?

761
01:57:10,729 --> 01:57:11,609
What's this?

762
01:57:11,609 --> 01:57:28,159
They get up really quick.

763
01:57:28,159 --> 01:57:29,119
What is happening?

764
01:57:29,119 --> 01:57:56,350
Your fucking aim is so annoying.

765
01:57:56,350 --> 01:57:59,899
How do I get out of here?

766
01:58:00,460 --> 01:58:02,960
There's a vent, vent, vent, vent, vent, vent, vent.

767
01:58:02,960 --> 01:58:03,600
Vent!

768
01:58:03,600 --> 01:58:04,239
Get in the vent!

769
01:58:04,800 --> 01:58:06,079
Get in the vent!

770
01:58:08,729 --> 01:58:09,050
God.

771
01:58:09,689 --> 01:58:11,210
Make them shoot each other.

772
01:58:11,210 --> 01:58:19,529
Now don't get up.

773
01:58:19,529 --> 01:58:57,079
I thought he was going to get up.

774
01:58:57,079 --> 01:59:02,090
I thought he was going to get up.

775
01:59:02,090 --> 01:59:04,890
They got up before in like 15 seconds.

776
01:59:04,890 --> 01:59:32,649
Nice.

777
01:59:32,649 --> 01:59:33,369
Nice.

778
01:59:33,369 --> 01:59:37,760
Anything else?

779
01:59:37,760 --> 01:59:39,119
Ooh, I can steal in here.

780
01:59:39,119 --> 01:59:48,460
Doesn't come back on, does it?

781
01:59:48,460 --> 02:00:01,449
Really?

782
02:00:01,449 --> 02:00:03,689
Ooh, an MP3 player.

783
02:00:03,689 --> 02:00:04,729
Oh, okay.

784
02:00:36,619 --> 02:00:38,840
My guards.

785
02:00:38,840 --> 02:00:39,399
Night vision.

786
02:00:39,960 --> 02:00:42,600
I don't, I don't want to use night vision.

787
02:00:42,600 --> 02:00:43,560
No, I don't want to use it.

788
02:00:44,279 --> 02:00:45,560
It looks worse.

789
02:00:45,560 --> 02:01:00,479
I get it.

790
02:01:00,479 --> 02:01:01,359
I get it now.

791
02:01:01,359 --> 02:01:04,239
I'm using sonar through the walls.

792
02:01:04,239 --> 02:01:25,039
Pretty sick.

793
02:01:25,039 --> 02:01:49,819
Is anybody there?

794
02:02:04,140 --> 02:02:09,600
I'm like chewing on wet concrete trying to use the inverted controls.

795
02:02:09,600 --> 02:02:26,319
It's just like, I'm just like.

796
02:02:31,199 --> 02:02:32,539
I don't know what it means.

797
02:02:32,539 --> 02:02:37,020
What the fuck does that mean?

798
02:02:37,930 --> 02:02:38,729
I don't do this.

799
02:02:38,729 --> 02:02:40,489
It's, I'm just using a phrase.

800
02:02:40,489 --> 02:02:44,170
Stop moaning.

801
02:02:44,810 --> 02:02:51,399
I'm going to do whatever I want.

802
02:02:51,399 --> 02:02:52,859
Right.

803
02:02:52,859 --> 02:02:53,899
Where is this guy?

804
02:02:53,899 --> 02:03:00,409
Press A to select the hacking target.

805
02:03:00,409 --> 02:03:03,800
Use the left dump stick to copy the computer sequence.

806
02:03:03,800 --> 02:03:04,520
Right dump stick.

807
02:03:04,520 --> 02:03:05,880
L and R control the camera.

808
02:03:05,880 --> 02:03:24,029
Jerma, you're a brat.

809
02:03:24,029 --> 02:03:25,229
What's going on?

810
02:03:25,229 --> 02:03:27,470
What was, what happened?

811
02:03:27,470 --> 02:03:28,750
How did I fail the hack?

812
02:03:28,750 --> 02:03:58,430
Do I even need the key anymore?

813
02:03:58,430 --> 02:04:00,920
I don't need the key.

814
02:04:28,199 --> 02:04:42,800
We're good.

815
02:04:42,800 --> 02:04:43,609
Everything's fine.

816
02:05:15,680 --> 02:05:16,159
What?

817
02:05:16,159 --> 02:05:16,640
What?

818
02:05:16,640 --> 02:05:41,630
What?

819
02:05:41,630 --> 02:05:42,130
What?

820
02:05:42,750 --> 02:06:03,289
Dude, this guy's fucking final boss.

821
02:06:04,010 --> 02:06:14,060
All right.

822
02:06:14,060 --> 02:06:15,689
Steal.

823
02:06:15,689 --> 02:06:16,409
Steal.

824
02:06:16,409 --> 02:06:29,659
Oh my God.

825
02:06:29,659 --> 02:06:32,460
The analog just fucked me up, guys.

826
02:06:32,460 --> 02:06:33,420
The analog went like.

827
02:06:57,159 --> 02:06:58,279
Oh, come on.

828
02:06:58,279 --> 02:06:59,399
Get away from me.

829
02:06:59,399 --> 02:07:00,279
Give me a break.

830
02:07:00,279 --> 02:07:07,260
Turn around.

831
02:07:07,260 --> 02:07:09,340
Don't point the flashlight on me.

832
02:07:09,340 --> 02:07:09,840
Fuck.

833
02:07:10,380 --> 02:07:30,600
The buttons are so fucked up.

834
02:07:30,600 --> 02:07:31,640
I promise.

835
02:07:31,640 --> 02:07:33,399
It's such a weird game to play.

836
02:07:51,630 --> 02:07:52,130
Shoot him.

837
02:07:52,840 --> 02:07:53,340
Shoot.

838
02:08:26,170 --> 02:08:26,409
Okay.

839
02:08:26,409 --> 02:08:27,050
Now what?

840
02:08:27,050 --> 02:08:27,550
Get out.

841
02:08:34,260 --> 02:08:37,779
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

842
02:08:42,109 --> 02:08:42,609
Yes.

843
02:08:43,390 --> 02:08:44,390
I'm good.

844
02:08:53,840 --> 02:09:03,010
I kind of like this game.

845
02:09:03,010 --> 02:09:03,510
It's fun.

846
02:09:04,130 --> 02:09:08,930
The night vision mode looks like you're inside of a Mountain Dew bottle.

847
02:09:08,930 --> 02:09:13,819
True.

848
02:09:13,819 --> 02:09:31,569
I like those glasses though.

849
02:09:31,569 --> 02:09:33,090
Those glasses are awesome.

850
02:09:33,090 --> 02:09:35,489
The door uses a swipe card system.

851
02:09:35,489 --> 02:09:44,979
If you kill the power, it'll release the light.

852
02:09:44,979 --> 02:09:45,779
I missed that.

853
02:09:45,779 --> 02:09:46,739
What did they, what did he say?

854
02:09:47,460 --> 02:09:49,779
He said that uses something.

855
02:09:50,739 --> 02:09:52,899
We'll lose something about a lock.

856
02:09:53,619 --> 02:09:59,739
Kill the power.

857
02:10:00,380 --> 02:10:18,560
What does it want me to do?

858
02:10:18,560 --> 02:10:20,939
I wasn't paying attention either.

859
02:10:20,939 --> 02:10:22,539
See, I'm not the only one.

860
02:10:22,539 --> 02:10:29,119
Okay, hold on.

861
02:10:29,119 --> 02:10:32,859
Should I go in the middle here?

862
02:10:32,859 --> 02:10:36,930
He said it out loud.

863
02:10:36,930 --> 02:10:38,850
But I didn't comprehend it.

864
02:10:38,850 --> 02:10:48,989
It was like something about using the light to see where I can go or something.

865
02:10:49,710 --> 02:10:53,760
Something to do with my, maybe an emitter.

866
02:10:56,640 --> 02:10:57,840
Turn power off.

867
02:10:57,840 --> 02:11:01,220
I don't know how to do that though.

868
02:11:01,220 --> 02:11:12,590
Destroy the electricity?

869
02:11:13,229 --> 02:11:16,270
I'm picking up some.

870
02:11:16,270 --> 02:11:22,819
How am I supposed to do this?

871
02:11:24,609 --> 02:11:27,010
Louie, you're full of surprises.

872
02:11:27,810 --> 02:11:31,500
I just walk through this like who cares?

873
02:11:35,329 --> 02:11:37,250
It is not an alarm.

874
02:11:37,250 --> 02:11:38,449
It's a Tesla coil.

875
02:11:39,090 --> 02:11:40,529
I thought it was an alarm system.

876
02:11:41,390 --> 02:11:42,750
It's not an alarm.

877
02:11:43,630 --> 02:11:44,829
This shit zaps you.

878
02:11:48,689 --> 02:11:53,819
Okay, so now I need a different solution than this.

879
02:11:53,819 --> 02:11:56,539
So I need to shoot something that's emitting this.

880
02:11:57,659 --> 02:12:00,460
And I should have listened to the guy talking.

881
02:12:32,140 --> 02:12:33,659
No, this is going to suck.

882
02:12:33,659 --> 02:12:34,699
I'm so dead.

883
02:12:34,699 --> 02:12:44,529
Get up.

884
02:12:44,529 --> 02:12:47,260
I can't get up from here.

885
02:12:51,619 --> 02:12:54,590
Oh my god.

886
02:12:54,590 --> 02:12:55,789
Okay, I get it.

887
02:12:55,789 --> 02:13:20,430
What are you?

888
02:13:20,430 --> 02:13:24,159
What?

889
02:13:24,159 --> 02:13:25,039
What was that?

890
02:13:25,039 --> 02:13:25,600
Why did that?

891
02:13:25,600 --> 02:13:26,159
I didn't press.

892
02:13:26,159 --> 02:13:27,600
I did not press A.

893
02:13:27,600 --> 02:13:30,399
I didn't even press A.

894
02:13:30,399 --> 02:13:31,039
I didn't even jump.

895
02:13:31,039 --> 02:14:16,289
That was weird.

896
02:14:16,289 --> 02:14:16,850
Got it.

897
02:14:16,850 --> 02:14:25,899
It's a lot of trouble just for one door.

898
02:14:25,899 --> 02:14:27,100
Can we use the Xbox now?

899
02:14:29,500 --> 02:14:32,689
Remember, you should put matching shades on.

900
02:14:32,689 --> 02:14:43,619
I can't just jump over the fence.

901
02:14:44,260 --> 02:14:46,670
That seems kind of...

902
02:14:46,670 --> 02:14:47,630
There's no way, right?

903
02:14:47,630 --> 02:14:48,109
Look at this.

904
02:14:48,109 --> 02:14:50,109
It wants me to go like boink up.

905
02:14:50,109 --> 02:14:52,829
This is not a chance.

906
02:14:52,829 --> 02:14:53,789
It does not want me to do that.

907
02:15:11,119 --> 02:15:19,229
Is something funny?

908
02:15:19,229 --> 02:15:20,109
No, I don't feel like it.

909
02:15:21,310 --> 02:15:43,500
There are more than two people here?

910
02:15:44,060 --> 02:15:44,880
There are.

911
02:15:44,880 --> 02:15:46,239
Okay, there's one down there and one over here.

912
02:16:10,109 --> 02:16:11,470
Get out of fucking fr-

913
02:16:11,470 --> 02:16:12,590
I'm done with this fucking game.

914
02:16:12,590 --> 02:16:13,550
I'm done with it.

915
02:16:13,550 --> 02:16:14,270
I'm done.

916
02:16:14,270 --> 02:16:15,229
I don't play this one anymore.

917
02:16:15,229 --> 02:16:16,109
I'm done playing this one.

918
02:16:16,109 --> 02:16:17,949
This one was fun for a few minutes.

919
02:16:17,949 --> 02:16:19,810
I'm going to put on this one.

920
02:16:25,699 --> 02:16:31,630
Death Row Underground Team Combat.

921
02:16:31,630 --> 02:16:33,149
That was fun for a minute.

922
02:16:33,149 --> 02:16:39,229
Seeing some pogs on this one.

923
02:16:39,229 --> 02:16:40,190
This is a good one.

924
02:16:40,190 --> 02:16:44,530
Can you do a piss break?

925
02:16:44,530 --> 02:16:46,030
Do you guys need a piss break?

926
02:16:46,030 --> 02:16:47,069
You guys good?

927
02:16:47,069 --> 02:16:50,659
Piss break?

928
02:16:50,659 --> 02:16:51,620
What do you think?

929
02:16:51,620 --> 02:16:51,940
Yeah?

930
02:16:51,940 --> 02:16:52,739
Maybe?

931
02:16:52,739 --> 02:16:53,979
You guys need a piss break?

932
02:16:57,299 --> 02:16:58,719
Yeah?

933
02:16:58,719 --> 02:16:59,360
No?

934
02:16:59,360 --> 02:17:00,459
All right, fine.

935
02:17:00,459 --> 02:17:01,180
We'll do it.

936
02:17:01,180 --> 02:17:02,059
It's been a few hours.

937
02:17:02,059 --> 02:17:03,260
It's been like two and a half hours, right?

938
02:17:03,260 --> 02:17:04,059
Yeah.

939
02:17:04,059 --> 02:17:04,799
All right.

940
02:17:04,799 --> 02:17:05,600
We'll take a quick break.

941
02:17:05,600 --> 02:17:06,399
I'll be right back.

942
02:17:06,399 --> 02:17:07,680
I'll see you guys in a minute.

943
02:17:07,680 --> 02:17:12,780
We'll come back with Death Row fighting game or something.

944
02:17:12,780 --> 02:22:21,649
I'll be right back.

945
02:22:21,649 --> 02:22:22,930
I have returned back.

946
02:22:23,969 --> 02:22:25,540
Hello.

947
02:22:25,540 --> 02:22:28,370
How's it going?

948
02:22:28,370 --> 02:22:33,700
Okay, here it is.

949
02:22:33,700 --> 02:22:34,819
Uh, here you go.

950
02:22:35,379 --> 02:22:37,600
See it, right?

951
02:22:37,600 --> 02:22:39,170
Can you hear it?

952
02:22:39,170 --> 02:22:39,809
Good.

953
02:22:39,809 --> 02:22:41,180
Okay.

954
02:22:41,180 --> 02:22:43,579
Uh, this is not what I thought it was going to be.

955
02:22:44,219 --> 02:22:45,379
Not even close.

956
02:22:46,559 --> 02:22:48,959
I thought this was going to be a game where you fight.

957
02:22:48,959 --> 02:22:51,760
It's like a big brawl of underground fighting.

958
02:22:52,399 --> 02:22:54,719
I think it's a sport.

959
02:22:54,719 --> 02:22:59,739
It's some kind of sport.

960
02:23:01,180 --> 02:23:02,139
It's like basketball.

961
02:23:02,139 --> 02:23:05,280
But with a disc or something.

962
02:23:05,920 --> 02:23:08,030
Should we do sports view?

963
02:23:08,030 --> 02:23:09,549
Or it's probably sports view, right?

964
02:23:10,670 --> 02:23:24,340
The droids versus the blitzards.

965
02:23:24,340 --> 02:23:28,350
How do you play?

966
02:23:28,909 --> 02:23:35,069
This is my lineup.

967
02:23:35,629 --> 02:23:55,469
Oh, definitely Blitz Andy versus the training droids.

968
02:24:04,500 --> 02:24:58,510
What?

969
02:24:58,510 --> 02:25:01,329
Did I get a point?

970
02:25:01,329 --> 02:25:01,969
What?

971
02:25:01,969 --> 02:25:06,479
Okay.

972
02:25:06,479 --> 02:25:07,520
Where's the disc?

973
02:25:07,520 --> 02:25:20,850
I just injured the droid.

974
02:25:21,489 --> 02:25:27,100
Pass it, pass it, pass it, pass it, pass it.

975
02:25:27,659 --> 02:25:28,930
Pass it over here.

976
02:25:30,319 --> 02:25:31,200
Pass it.

977
02:25:31,200 --> 02:25:48,989
Okay.

978
02:25:48,989 --> 02:25:50,670
Oh, this is actually kind of cool.

979
02:25:51,309 --> 02:26:23,280
All right.

980
02:26:23,280 --> 02:26:24,159
Where's the disc?

981
02:26:24,159 --> 02:26:34,659
Let's go.

982
02:26:34,659 --> 02:26:35,940
R to locate the disc.

983
02:26:35,940 --> 02:26:36,979
Isn't that what I'm pressing?

984
02:26:36,979 --> 02:26:54,139
We're running by three points.

985
02:26:54,139 --> 02:27:13,700
All right.

986
02:27:13,700 --> 02:27:14,180
We win.

987
02:27:20,100 --> 02:27:21,459
Replay the round.

988
02:27:31,059 --> 02:27:33,459
That counts as two points?

989
02:27:33,459 --> 02:27:34,420
I threw it behind.

990
02:27:35,219 --> 02:27:46,030
Oh, that's when I was just injuring people.

991
02:27:49,379 --> 02:27:49,780
Okay.

992
02:27:49,780 --> 02:27:50,020
All right.

993
02:27:50,020 --> 02:27:50,420
All right.

994
02:27:50,420 --> 02:27:50,739
All right.

995
02:27:50,739 --> 02:27:51,139
I get it.

996
02:27:51,139 --> 02:27:51,540
I get it.

997
02:27:52,180 --> 02:27:53,379
All right.

998
02:27:53,379 --> 02:27:53,700
I get it.

999
02:27:53,700 --> 02:27:54,100
I get it.

1000
02:27:54,100 --> 02:27:54,420
I get it.

1001
02:27:55,059 --> 02:27:55,459
I get it.

1002
02:27:55,459 --> 02:27:55,780
I get it.

1003
02:27:55,780 --> 02:27:56,579
We don't even do it again.

1004
02:27:58,959 --> 02:27:59,680
Game stinks.

1005
02:28:00,319 --> 02:28:01,280
I don't think it does.

1006
02:28:07,819 --> 02:28:09,020
Crowd sounds like a vacuum.

1007
02:28:10,590 --> 02:28:11,069
All right.

1008
02:28:11,069 --> 02:28:11,950
Single match.

1009
02:28:11,950 --> 02:28:12,670
Conquest.

1010
02:28:14,500 --> 02:28:15,139
Okay.

1011
02:28:15,139 --> 02:28:16,100
Conquest.

1012
02:28:16,100 --> 02:28:20,899
The Blitzers.

1013
02:28:24,909 --> 02:28:25,709
No rules.

1014
02:28:26,430 --> 02:28:29,700
Oh, these are the teams.

1015
02:28:29,700 --> 02:28:30,819
The Seacats.

1016
02:28:30,819 --> 02:28:32,000
The Protectors.

1017
02:28:32,860 --> 02:28:33,420
Convicts.

1018
02:28:33,979 --> 02:28:39,459
There are four teams in this league.

1019
02:28:39,459 --> 02:28:47,500
Who has the highest punch percentage?

1020
02:28:47,500 --> 02:28:53,780
It's convicts.

1021
02:28:53,780 --> 02:29:03,659
Convicts are the worst scum of the galaxy.

1022
02:29:03,659 --> 02:29:05,600
The most hardened criminals.

1023
02:29:05,600 --> 02:29:09,569
Senses to death for the most abominable acts.

1024
02:29:11,040 --> 02:29:15,440
Penitentiary governors lured them on with the promise that victory would lead to freedom.

1025
02:29:15,440 --> 02:29:17,840
It was mostly out of sheer bloodlust that they entered the arena.

1026
02:29:17,840 --> 02:29:23,409
For these guys, it's victory or death.

1027
02:29:23,409 --> 02:29:24,049
Okay.

1028
02:29:24,049 --> 02:29:27,340
Okay.

1029
02:29:27,340 --> 02:29:33,360
We've got Alvarez, Zeke, Becker, and Toro.

1030
02:29:33,360 --> 02:29:44,209
I don't think this really matters.

1031
02:29:44,209 --> 02:29:55,459
I'm going to challenge the Blitzers.

1032
02:29:55,459 --> 02:30:08,209
Is somebody behind you?

1033
02:30:17,920 --> 02:30:20,450
Where is he?

1034
02:30:20,450 --> 02:30:21,489
Oh, there you are.

1035
02:30:21,489 --> 02:30:23,620
Hey, Tacho.

1036
02:30:23,620 --> 02:30:24,579
Do you want to leave?

1037
02:30:25,219 --> 02:30:26,979
He's lying down over here.

1038
02:30:27,700 --> 02:30:28,620
Do you want to leave?

1039
02:30:29,180 --> 02:30:33,569
Do you want to leave?

1040
02:30:33,569 --> 02:30:35,629
Do you want to get out of here?

1041
02:30:36,430 --> 02:30:36,750
All right.

1042
02:30:36,750 --> 02:30:37,149
Let's go.

1043
02:30:37,709 --> 02:30:38,510
I don't see him.

1044
02:30:39,069 --> 02:30:39,629
Give me one sec.

1045
02:31:01,700 --> 02:31:02,500
Show Otto?

1046
02:31:02,500 --> 02:31:03,620
Oh, okay.

1047
02:31:03,620 --> 02:31:04,979
Um, he's got to get in the right spot.

1048
02:31:04,979 --> 02:31:06,020
Otto, go over here.

1049
02:31:06,020 --> 02:31:06,659
Come over here.

1050
02:31:06,659 --> 02:31:07,540
Let's go.

1051
02:31:07,540 --> 02:31:08,420
Go over that way.

1052
02:31:08,420 --> 02:31:10,399
Go over so they can see you.

1053
02:31:10,399 --> 02:31:17,579
Otto?

1054
02:31:18,139 --> 02:31:20,829
Hey, look up here.

1055
02:31:20,829 --> 02:31:22,750
Oh, you can kind of see his butt.

1056
02:31:24,639 --> 02:31:25,440
What's up?

1057
02:31:25,440 --> 02:31:26,700
Do you want to get out of here?

1058
02:31:26,700 --> 02:31:27,100
Okay.

1059
02:31:27,100 --> 02:31:27,500
All right.

1060
02:31:27,500 --> 02:31:27,979
We're back.

1061
02:31:28,700 --> 02:31:31,010
Let's go.

1062
02:31:32,590 --> 02:31:34,030
Excited dog.

1063
02:31:34,030 --> 02:31:36,530
Cartoon.

1064
02:31:36,530 --> 02:31:37,409
Let's go.

1065
02:31:37,409 --> 02:34:17,149
Okay.

1066
02:34:17,149 --> 02:34:17,629
He's good.

1067
02:34:20,989 --> 02:34:22,479
I took that one out.

1068
02:34:22,479 --> 02:34:24,290
I think we saw all we needed to see.

1069
02:34:24,850 --> 02:34:34,700
I mean, what did I do?

1070
02:34:34,700 --> 02:34:45,979
Court is down.

1071
02:34:45,979 --> 02:34:46,879
Oh, I don't know.

1072
02:34:50,420 --> 02:34:50,819
I don't know.

1073
02:34:51,459 --> 02:34:55,840
All right.

1074
02:34:55,840 --> 02:34:56,479
We're putting in.

1075
02:34:57,360 --> 02:34:59,200
I feel like we're going to be in this one for at least half hour.

1076
02:35:03,360 --> 02:35:04,559
Maybe not, though.

1077
02:35:04,559 --> 02:35:06,180
This is Eragon?

1078
02:35:07,360 --> 02:35:09,840
That movie with the dragons?

1079
02:35:09,840 --> 02:35:10,479
Eragon?

1080
02:35:10,479 --> 02:35:11,040
Eragon?

1081
02:35:11,600 --> 02:35:12,079
Eragon?

1082
02:35:12,819 --> 02:35:13,540
Eragon?

1083
02:35:13,540 --> 02:35:14,180
Eragon?

1084
02:35:14,180 --> 02:35:17,489
Eragon?

1085
02:35:17,489 --> 02:35:19,659
Eragon.

1086
02:35:19,659 --> 02:35:28,930
Yo, this game.

1087
02:35:28,930 --> 02:35:30,450
People are excited about this one.

1088
02:35:30,450 --> 02:35:37,340
Okay.

1089
02:35:37,340 --> 02:35:38,139
Let's see it.

1090
02:35:38,139 --> 02:35:48,959
Why can I not hear this?

1091
02:35:48,959 --> 02:36:13,760
I don't hear anything.

1092
02:36:13,760 --> 02:36:14,399
Why can you?

1093
02:36:14,399 --> 02:36:14,879
That's weird.

1094
02:36:26,239 --> 02:36:26,479
Okay.

1095
02:36:26,479 --> 02:36:26,879
Now I can.

1096
02:36:27,520 --> 02:36:28,399
There's a cord loose.

1097
02:36:29,120 --> 02:36:29,889
All right.

1098
02:36:29,889 --> 02:36:30,530
Eragon.

1099
02:36:34,239 --> 02:36:35,680
Never saw this movie.

1100
02:36:35,680 --> 02:36:41,090
I haven't seen this movie.

1101
02:36:41,729 --> 02:36:48,100
It was a book?

1102
02:36:48,100 --> 02:36:53,360
That was weird.

1103
02:36:53,360 --> 02:36:55,840
A time without tyranny or fear

1104
02:36:55,840 --> 02:36:58,700
does fill this sky.

1105
02:36:58,700 --> 02:37:04,959
Thorix now rules.

1106
02:37:07,120 --> 02:37:13,809
Wicked shade enforces Galvatrix's iron rule.

1107
02:37:13,809 --> 02:37:17,500
The reach of despots is limited.

1108
02:37:17,500 --> 02:37:21,260
And even Galvatrix couldn't touch one unsuspecting farm boy.

1109
02:37:21,979 --> 02:37:24,059
A boy whose heart burned with hope.

1110
02:37:24,059 --> 02:37:25,579
Like old film?

1111
02:37:25,579 --> 02:37:27,260
What is this old film?

1112
02:37:27,260 --> 02:37:44,829
Okay.

1113
02:38:09,139 --> 02:38:09,940
Oh my god.

1114
02:38:09,940 --> 02:38:10,739
That was loud.

1115
02:38:11,540 --> 02:38:16,379
Those combos.

1116
02:38:31,629 --> 02:38:32,989
That was all my left ear.

1117
02:38:33,709 --> 02:38:34,770
This game is awesome.

1118
02:38:35,409 --> 02:38:37,250
Is it?

1119
02:38:37,250 --> 02:38:46,420
I thought that was her screaming.

1120
02:38:46,420 --> 02:39:23,340
It feels like we're watching a mobile game ad.

1121
02:39:46,290 --> 02:39:49,329
Jump and grab the rock ledge then use L to move across.

1122
02:39:49,809 --> 02:39:50,209
Got it.

1123
02:39:51,940 --> 02:39:53,059
Just make my way home.

1124
02:40:04,420 --> 02:40:08,829
Enough's enough.

1125
02:40:10,479 --> 02:40:12,079
Hold and hold R to draw your bow.

1126
02:40:12,079 --> 02:40:13,200
That just makes perfect.

1127
02:40:13,200 --> 02:40:16,559
It targets by moving R and fire.

1128
02:40:25,309 --> 02:40:43,549
It's so cool that he's using his camcorder to record this.

1129
02:40:46,930 --> 02:40:51,809
Dude this is what video games looked like back in like 2005, 2003.

1130
02:40:52,690 --> 02:40:56,860
The stone, Ardya.

1131
02:40:56,860 --> 02:40:58,819
Be the stone.

1132
02:40:58,819 --> 02:40:59,299
The stone.

1133
02:40:59,299 --> 02:41:00,739
And that you will live.

1134
02:41:00,739 --> 02:41:01,520
The stone.

1135
02:41:02,479 --> 02:41:02,879
Yes.

1136
02:41:03,889 --> 02:41:05,809
No the game looked like shit back then too.

1137
02:41:05,809 --> 02:41:06,290
Did it?

1138
02:41:14,739 --> 02:41:24,700
Fate destined to change our world.

1139
02:41:24,700 --> 02:41:30,319
Oh yeah there's dragons in this.

1140
02:41:39,729 --> 02:41:39,969
Cool.

1141
02:41:41,950 --> 02:41:43,940
Okay.

1142
02:41:43,940 --> 02:41:44,739
Power orbs.

1143
02:41:45,459 --> 02:41:47,040
I didn't find the secret egg.

1144
02:41:50,959 --> 02:41:57,780
I feel like I need to shake and then pop off at the end.

1145
02:41:57,780 --> 02:42:02,750
Eventually discovered that what he found in the spine was not a simple stone.

1146
02:42:03,389 --> 02:42:07,469
But a small blue.

1147
02:42:11,010 --> 02:42:17,309
The dragon quickly grew as out speaking.

1148
02:42:17,309 --> 02:42:21,389
He was furious that the egg was lost.

1149
02:42:21,389 --> 02:42:26,610
And he commanded Dosa to finally feed a new rider which strengthened the resistance.

1150
02:42:26,610 --> 02:42:34,850
Led by a group called the Varden.

1151
02:42:34,850 --> 02:42:36,530
Why is this pacing so cracked?

1152
02:42:42,299 --> 02:42:45,969
I think it's just it's hard to make a cutscene.

1153
02:42:46,530 --> 02:42:48,909
Especially back here in the day.

1154
02:42:48,909 --> 02:42:49,870
It's like hard.

1155
02:42:51,860 --> 02:42:56,340
You know how many hoops and strings that they had to pull through to just

1156
02:42:56,340 --> 02:42:58,659
to make any of this look like anything you care about?

1157
02:42:59,620 --> 02:43:02,909
There's so many tricks to make it even look like this.

1158
02:43:23,469 --> 02:43:28,719
Do I get to fly a dragon?

1159
02:43:29,360 --> 02:43:43,899
Am I cutting their heads off?

1160
02:43:44,540 --> 02:43:53,819
Use grapple combo grab stun for a few.

1161
02:43:55,020 --> 02:44:04,860
I'm just my body might want to sneeze so bad but I just can't.

1162
02:44:26,829 --> 02:44:28,829
Okay this game is pretty cool.

1163
02:44:28,829 --> 02:44:41,579
Oh my god.

1164
02:44:42,700 --> 02:44:50,430
How do I aim?

1165
02:45:06,209 --> 02:45:07,409
He's doing it too.

1166
02:45:07,409 --> 02:45:08,610
You figured out the strategy.

1167
02:45:09,489 --> 02:45:12,180
This is a tower defense game now.

1168
02:45:12,819 --> 02:45:18,850
I think I'm probably going to need some cannon towers in a minute.

1169
02:45:19,489 --> 02:45:21,979
After next round.

1170
02:45:22,700 --> 02:45:24,059
Probably two cannon towers in the front.

1171
02:45:30,270 --> 02:45:31,069
Fury mode?

1172
02:45:34,500 --> 02:45:35,139
L and R.

1173
02:45:38,620 --> 02:45:40,219
L and R sticks.

1174
02:46:10,500 --> 02:46:12,100
Pressure chest contain items break them.

1175
02:46:13,620 --> 02:46:14,120
What's in it?

1176
02:46:18,379 --> 02:46:19,100
Health orb?

1177
02:46:19,659 --> 02:46:23,819
No you have to put money or items weapons jewels something like that.

1178
02:46:27,860 --> 02:46:29,059
It better not be a health orb.

1179
02:46:30,579 --> 02:46:43,100
Okay it's loud.

1180
02:46:45,170 --> 02:46:46,049
That was it.

1181
02:46:46,049 --> 02:46:47,409
That was the start of it.

1182
02:46:47,409 --> 02:46:51,170
That was that was actually the start of it.

1183
02:46:51,170 --> 02:46:52,930
It's just slowed down.

1184
02:47:19,709 --> 02:47:57,790
Block.

1185
02:47:57,790 --> 02:48:02,670
Right now there's somebody that was like oh dude Aragorn the game this is my childhood.

1186
02:48:02,670 --> 02:48:04,350
And they're watching this right now.

1187
02:48:04,350 --> 02:48:10,500
They're going no it gets no it gets better.

1188
02:48:10,500 --> 02:48:12,180
I can't wait till the dragon shows up.

1189
02:48:12,899 --> 02:48:14,340
Wait till the dragon shows up.

1190
02:48:14,340 --> 02:48:27,600
Move the smithy.

1191
02:48:27,600 --> 02:48:29,440
That is a bloody sword.

1192
02:48:29,440 --> 02:48:40,079
I should wait shooting at them.

1193
02:48:40,079 --> 02:48:40,799
Keep steady.

1194
02:48:40,799 --> 02:49:01,739
That was awful.

1195
02:49:01,739 --> 02:49:04,540
Okay get close and then use your kill move.

1196
02:49:04,540 --> 02:49:09,860
Oh my god.

1197
02:49:10,979 --> 02:49:13,700
Who are these people that were doing this?

1198
02:49:13,700 --> 02:49:14,579
Why are we attacking these?

1199
02:49:14,579 --> 02:49:15,780
What's the point here?

1200
02:49:15,780 --> 02:49:20,860
Should we do fury?

1201
02:49:21,579 --> 02:49:22,139
Fury mode.

1202
02:49:22,780 --> 02:50:09,569
Play Rats too?

1203
02:50:09,569 --> 02:50:10,370
I already did.

1204
02:50:10,370 --> 02:50:14,799
Yeah it's called Aragorn.

1205
02:50:14,799 --> 02:50:16,979
What happened?

1206
02:50:16,979 --> 02:50:18,260
I just skipped wait we just what happened?

1207
02:50:18,260 --> 02:50:18,979
I missed the cutscene.

1208
02:50:19,620 --> 02:50:34,899
Stop getting so close.

1209
02:50:37,700 --> 02:50:38,500
Oh my god.

1210
02:50:38,500 --> 02:50:39,700
I'm just trying to get out of here.

1211
02:50:40,579 --> 02:51:11,170
All right let's go.

1212
02:51:12,030 --> 02:51:12,909
Let's go.

1213
02:51:12,909 --> 02:51:14,110
All right let's go.

1214
02:51:14,110 --> 02:51:22,670
Play Stuart Little.

1215
02:51:22,670 --> 02:51:24,430
No we have to get to the dragon part.

1216
02:51:24,430 --> 02:51:26,270
I'm not stopping this till the dragon's here.

1217
02:51:51,629 --> 02:51:52,430
Saving game.

1218
02:51:52,430 --> 02:51:52,989
All right good.

1219
02:52:03,100 --> 02:52:05,739
Rom has been given Aragorn an old sword.

1220
02:52:05,739 --> 02:52:07,420
Your attacks are now stronger.

1221
02:52:07,979 --> 02:52:15,379
Do your best Stuart Little impression.

1222
02:52:16,299 --> 02:52:19,260
Well I I think that it's going to be a really fun day today.

1223
02:52:19,899 --> 02:52:20,780
I have no idea.

1224
02:52:20,780 --> 02:52:21,500
I've never seen it.

1225
02:52:21,500 --> 02:52:22,620
I've never heard him talk once.

1226
02:52:40,350 --> 02:52:41,309
That was the Joker.

1227
02:52:46,479 --> 02:52:48,799
Can we start reading fire at people?

1228
02:52:58,940 --> 02:53:00,540
I do appreciate we're getting there quickly.

1229
02:53:02,030 --> 02:53:02,989
Quickly.

1230
02:53:02,989 --> 02:53:22,659
Everything is the Joker, Alex Jones, or Mr. Satan.

1231
02:53:22,659 --> 02:53:23,299
Or Trump.

1232
02:53:44,190 --> 02:53:44,989
How are there too many?

1233
02:53:48,770 --> 02:53:49,889
Headbutting this guy?

1234
02:53:52,590 --> 02:53:53,309
What do you want?

1235
02:53:53,309 --> 02:53:54,110
What are we doing here?

1236
02:54:00,209 --> 02:54:00,930
No!

1237
02:54:00,930 --> 02:54:01,170
No!

1238
02:54:14,530 --> 02:54:15,649
Jump to the ledge.

1239
02:54:15,649 --> 02:54:16,290
Where am I going?

1240
02:54:21,059 --> 02:54:22,420
That was far.

1241
02:54:40,459 --> 02:54:41,180
Yo.

1242
02:54:41,180 --> 02:54:48,370
He said not to fight.

1243
02:54:48,370 --> 02:55:09,600
I think they're supposed to be spawning over here

1244
02:55:09,600 --> 02:55:12,159
but the game is really confused about what's happening.

1245
02:55:12,159 --> 02:55:19,620
You jump.

1246
02:55:19,620 --> 02:55:20,659
Get up.

1247
02:55:20,659 --> 02:55:39,940
This was released on the 360 and PC.

1248
02:55:39,940 --> 02:55:43,020
I just missed an incredibly important thing.

1249
02:55:44,750 --> 02:55:45,950
You used magic.

1250
02:55:45,950 --> 02:55:48,659
A gift all dragon riders possess.

1251
02:55:48,659 --> 02:55:50,940
Concentrate.

1252
02:55:50,940 --> 02:55:51,340
Quickly.

1253
02:55:51,340 --> 02:55:52,379
The archers.

1254
02:55:52,379 --> 02:55:54,059
Stay sharp son.

1255
02:55:54,059 --> 02:55:55,260
Use your magic again.

1256
02:55:55,260 --> 02:56:05,950
I didn't even look.

1257
02:56:06,510 --> 02:56:18,159
Who gives a shit about magic?

1258
02:56:18,159 --> 02:56:19,600
I want to see the dragon.

1259
02:56:19,600 --> 02:56:29,889
Okay.

1260
02:56:49,969 --> 02:56:54,940
How did you miss that?

1261
02:56:55,500 --> 02:57:01,100
Did he just get knocked off the edge?

1262
02:57:01,100 --> 02:57:01,899
No wait what?

1263
02:57:01,899 --> 02:57:02,780
Oh no he just did.

1264
02:57:02,780 --> 02:57:03,659
Wait what?

1265
02:57:03,659 --> 02:57:05,020
I'm so confused what just happened.

1266
02:57:09,709 --> 02:57:10,989
Why is it going up?

1267
02:57:10,989 --> 02:57:27,889
Oh my god stop.

1268
02:57:28,530 --> 02:57:47,739
Let's go!

1269
02:57:51,010 --> 02:57:51,489
Let's go!

1270
02:58:01,659 --> 02:58:02,459
This camera.

1271
02:58:02,459 --> 02:58:04,219
I can't tell what's happening.

1272
02:58:04,219 --> 02:58:09,780
Let's move.

1273
02:58:09,780 --> 02:58:14,110
What's what's happening here?

1274
02:58:14,670 --> 02:58:16,049
What's the problem here?

1275
02:58:16,610 --> 02:58:25,899
What's the problem here?

1276
02:58:25,899 --> 02:58:37,440
What's the problem here?

1277
02:58:37,440 --> 02:58:46,479
Stuart Little 2 impression.

1278
02:58:46,479 --> 02:58:47,840
That's when they introduced the sidekick.

1279
02:58:47,840 --> 02:58:55,620
It was like a little dog right?

1280
02:58:55,700 --> 02:58:57,700
Stuart Little and Dougie Doo.

1281
02:58:57,700 --> 02:59:03,860
It was a bird.

1282
02:59:04,420 --> 02:59:05,219
Oh that's right.

1283
02:59:05,219 --> 02:59:05,780
Shit sorry.

1284
02:59:06,340 --> 02:59:08,590
I just made it up because I've never seen or heard of it.

1285
02:59:09,469 --> 02:59:11,389
The only time I knew what Stuart Little was

1286
02:59:11,950 --> 02:59:15,790
is because I saw like a TV commercial for it once.

1287
02:59:16,829 --> 02:59:19,360
And Dr House is in it.

1288
02:59:29,469 --> 02:59:30,270
Watch it right now.

1289
02:59:30,829 --> 02:59:37,250
Dude what are we doing?

1290
02:59:37,250 --> 02:59:38,370
How do I keep going?

1291
02:59:43,010 --> 02:59:44,370
Oh my god.

1292
02:59:44,370 --> 02:59:44,850
What do I?

1293
02:59:58,350 --> 02:59:59,229
But I mean.

1294
02:59:59,389 --> 02:59:59,889
I mean.

1295
03:00:03,659 --> 03:00:05,260
He's game sucks.

1296
03:00:05,260 --> 03:00:05,979
He sucks.

1297
03:00:07,809 --> 03:00:08,930
He sucks.

1298
03:00:13,090 --> 03:00:14,530
Dude he sucks.

1299
03:00:20,850 --> 03:00:22,690
All right aim at the right thing please.

1300
03:00:26,690 --> 03:00:28,450
All right roll off.

1301
03:00:28,450 --> 03:00:29,809
Do I have to you have to kill everybody.

1302
03:00:34,940 --> 03:00:36,700
I just want to fly around in a dragon.

1303
03:00:37,260 --> 03:00:50,219
Is the dragon talking this?

1304
03:00:52,159 --> 03:00:54,559
Is it like Aragorn you and I?

1305
03:00:54,559 --> 03:00:55,920
Is it like or is it deep?

1306
03:00:55,920 --> 03:00:57,280
It's like you and I must.

1307
03:00:58,000 --> 03:01:13,950
Dragon's a girl?

1308
03:01:13,950 --> 03:01:16,350
Oh okay so it but is it a deep?

1309
03:01:16,829 --> 03:01:20,350
Is it like or is it uh hold on.

1310
03:01:26,350 --> 03:01:28,190
Damn this game is blurry.

1311
03:01:28,829 --> 03:01:31,170
No no no no no no no no no no.

1312
03:01:31,170 --> 03:01:32,049
Spin it back around.

1313
03:01:32,049 --> 03:01:33,170
I want to spin it back around.

1314
03:01:33,729 --> 03:01:41,940
Does that help our cause?

1315
03:01:41,940 --> 03:01:42,500
Yes it does.

1316
03:01:46,510 --> 03:01:58,129
Nice okay.

1317
03:02:00,579 --> 03:02:01,940
All right let's go.

1318
03:02:07,260 --> 03:02:30,799
Aragorn police helicopter angle.

1319
03:02:30,799 --> 03:02:34,420
I just want to ride the dragon.

1320
03:02:47,469 --> 03:02:48,989
The Battle of Home Depot.

1321
03:02:51,979 --> 03:03:14,139
The dragon's probably 50 hours in dude.

1322
03:03:14,139 --> 03:03:15,420
I doubt that.

1323
03:03:15,420 --> 03:03:22,510
All right jump on this.

1324
03:03:23,069 --> 03:03:26,129
All right we need to hang on this.

1325
03:03:26,850 --> 03:03:38,500
What the hell is going on?

1326
03:03:57,379 --> 03:03:58,899
Oh my god they just get replaced.

1327
03:03:58,899 --> 03:03:59,940
Okay what I don't get this.

1328
03:04:04,510 --> 03:04:05,229
Like climb it.

1329
03:04:07,840 --> 03:04:09,600
I pressed up and he didn't even move.

1330
03:04:13,250 --> 03:04:13,969
I pressed up.

1331
03:04:33,309 --> 03:04:36,059
Let let it go.

1332
03:04:37,340 --> 03:04:39,100
Let it let go.

1333
03:04:40,290 --> 03:04:40,930
Let go.

1334
03:04:41,649 --> 03:05:15,709
I used the potty all by myself.

1335
03:05:15,709 --> 03:05:17,389
Time the person up for five minutes.

1336
03:05:17,389 --> 03:05:37,260
Can you fucking help?

1337
03:05:37,819 --> 03:05:51,940
Still in blight town.

1338
03:05:52,819 --> 03:05:57,120
Now what?

1339
03:05:59,219 --> 03:05:59,459
What?

1340
03:06:04,180 --> 03:06:05,620
What am I looking at here?

1341
03:06:05,620 --> 03:06:15,780
You'll play this but you won't play Spyro.

1342
03:06:15,780 --> 03:06:17,280
You don't know that.

1343
03:06:17,280 --> 03:06:22,829
Oh my god stop dodging.

1344
03:06:22,829 --> 03:06:23,870
I want to do the magic.

1345
03:06:24,510 --> 03:06:32,399
You have to stand completely still or it doesn't work.

1346
03:06:32,959 --> 03:06:42,860
Because that's the same button as hold on.

1347
03:06:42,860 --> 03:06:43,500
Get off.

1348
03:06:50,979 --> 03:06:54,379
Oh my goodness.

1349
03:06:54,379 --> 03:07:09,920
I just want to I just want to.

1350
03:07:09,920 --> 03:07:10,639
I'm gonna put it on easy.

1351
03:07:10,639 --> 03:07:13,569
I just want to ride the dragon.

1352
03:07:13,569 --> 03:07:14,850
Oh this sucks.

1353
03:07:14,850 --> 03:07:18,510
Does anybody know when it when I actually get to play the dragon?

1354
03:07:18,510 --> 03:07:21,920
It's the only reason why I'm still here.

1355
03:07:30,540 --> 03:07:31,659
Triangle is jump.

1356
03:07:32,690 --> 03:07:33,969
X is dodge.

1357
03:07:34,690 --> 03:07:36,049
A is attack.

1358
03:07:36,049 --> 03:07:37,569
It's just all wrong.

1359
03:07:38,610 --> 03:07:41,329
Holding left trigger activates magic mode.

1360
03:07:41,329 --> 03:07:44,290
Which sometimes it's or if it's not magic mode it's a dodge.

1361
03:07:44,850 --> 03:07:48,530
It's just it's just all over the place.

1362
03:07:48,530 --> 03:07:50,530
It's just it's not what you think.

1363
03:07:55,280 --> 03:07:58,479
Triangle you know why whatever is also magic attack.

1364
03:08:01,059 --> 03:08:02,420
I'm just fucking sprinting I don't care.

1365
03:08:41,739 --> 03:08:44,459
Ah this is bad.

1366
03:08:44,459 --> 03:08:53,790
Oh shit oh no it's over I'm so screwed.

1367
03:08:55,280 --> 03:08:56,319
I can't get out of here.

1368
03:08:57,280 --> 03:09:00,000
Oh no okay okay okay.

1369
03:09:00,719 --> 03:09:02,159
All right everybody relax.

1370
03:09:03,940 --> 03:09:07,950
I have to beat this I don't care make fun of me.

1371
03:09:07,950 --> 03:09:14,479
Please veto this I I am only stopping when I get to the dragon.

1372
03:09:15,649 --> 03:09:17,649
I want to fly around in a dragon.

1373
03:09:17,649 --> 03:09:19,170
And I want to hear the dragon say.

1374
03:09:19,729 --> 03:09:22,739
Aragorn use my fire.

1375
03:09:23,620 --> 03:09:27,459
No come on I have to hear it.

1376
03:09:28,020 --> 03:09:31,250
Please that's all I care about.

1377
03:11:03,620 --> 03:11:20,370
What why are we so far away?

1378
03:11:21,010 --> 03:11:35,760
Oh my god oh my god.

1379
03:11:36,559 --> 03:11:53,520
Oh if we get a checkpoint yes.

1380
03:11:53,520 --> 03:11:59,979
You are at least 30 minutes of gameplay if you do exceptionally.

1381
03:11:59,979 --> 03:12:05,969
What if I do exceptionally well I have 30 at least 30 minutes of gameplay.

1382
03:12:05,969 --> 03:12:10,059
Before we get to the dragon that can't be right I refuse to believe it.

1383
03:12:15,629 --> 03:12:49,920
Why won't you lift up you know get over here and jump up and just grab it.

1384
03:12:49,920 --> 03:12:56,299
That guy is hopeless right now who cares.

1385
03:12:56,299 --> 03:12:58,219
All right we're getting there we're getting there we're getting there.

1386
03:12:58,219 --> 03:13:04,780
Just watch the dragon part on YouTube.

1387
03:13:04,780 --> 03:13:07,260
Why not just watch every single one of these games on YouTube.

1388
03:13:07,260 --> 03:13:09,739
And why play any of them for more than one second.

1389
03:13:09,739 --> 03:13:14,860
Why even own an Xbox if we're just going to open up a gameplay of every.

1390
03:13:14,860 --> 03:13:16,620
Oh what's this next one coming up.

1391

Pause the game hold L T R T L B R B press X four times and B two times.

1396
03:13:47,969 --> 03:13:54,780
The dragon is in about an hour.

1397
03:13:55,340 --> 03:13:59,520
What's the level select cheat.

1398
03:13:59,520 --> 03:14:31,379
How do I cheat to get level select speed run it's a 10 minute speed run.

1399
03:14:31,379 --> 03:14:33,920
Yeah but how do you even speed run.

1400
03:14:33,920 --> 03:14:51,329
There's no dragon in the game seven minutes.

There's only one cheat you need to earn it.

1413
03:16:22,370 --> 03:16:24,979
I definitely don't think I'm going to play this game for another hour.

1414
03:16:33,569 --> 03:16:35,090
All triggers X X BB.

The lock Aragon use your magic to the second block.

1420
03:18:00,430 --> 03:18:03,100

Turn the Xbox off turn on PS2.

1441
03:20:05,889 --> 03:20:08,850
Insert the Spyro game disc and then do this in real life.

1442
03:20:09,950 --> 03:20:10,350
Got it.

1443

03:21:14,270 --> 03:21:18,979
Sorry all right I have a choice for you.

1446
03:21:18,979 --> 03:21:28,420
Where are they gonna go to gladiator sword of vengeance or circus maximus.

1447
03:21:29,059 --> 03:21:36,590
Chariot wars both sound pretty enticing.

1448
03:21:36,590 --> 03:21:49,250
But which one which one are we going to do.

1449
03:21:49,250 --> 03:21:51,010
I don't think we even need to pull.

1450
03:21:51,010 --> 03:21:53,010

Hey come on taunt duck power attack accelerate.

03:25:48,959 --> 03:25:52,610

1481
03:25:52,610 --> 03:26:05,280
Elwynn forest I said it first.

1482
03:26:21,889 --> 03:26:23,489
Wait am I the back character.

03:26:23,489 --> 03:26:24,530
Oh shit hold on.

1484
03:26:32,829 --> 03:26:33,950
I don't think that's very safe.

1485
03:26:46,190 --> 03:26:46,510
Why.

1486
03:26:53,729 --> 03:26:57,329
Oh no I got lightheaded.

1487
03:26:57,329 --> 03:26:58,850
I got lightheaded I was about to scream.

1488

That was like I just like got started to laugh really hard.

1489
03:27:02,690 --> 03:27:06,930
But then I had to stop for a second because I just got really fucking lightheaded.

1490
03:27:08,899 --> 03:27:13,459
Okay relax we can get this back.

1491
03:27:14,180 --> 03:27:20,510
Hope I don't get passed but okay.

1492
03:27:22,930 --> 03:27:29,090
We'll get the controls down.

1493
03:27:32,239 --> 03:27:32,879
What happened.

1494
03:27:40,579 --> 03:27:41,620
Wait you dog.

1495
03:27:42,500 --> 03:27:48,750
He just shut up.

1496
03:27:48,750 --> 03:27:49,709
I'm gonna get laughed.

1497
03:27:50,270 --> 03:27:59,340
How do I go faster.

1498
03:27:59,979 --> 03:28:02,209
How do I go faster.

1499
03:28:03,010 --> 03:28:18,579
I'm actually I'm making ground on somebody.

1500
03:28:19,379 --> 03:28:22,530
There they are.

1501
03:28:23,090 --> 03:28:43,729
I'm making I'm making ground.

1502
03:29:06,350 --> 03:29:14,260
I got him got him.

1503
03:29:14,979 --> 03:29:21,870
Oh shit.

1504
03:29:22,750 --> 03:30:08,100
Oh god damn it bro there are 10 laps I don't want to do this.

1505
03:30:10,379 --> 03:30:11,340
Why did I do that.

1506
03:30:11,899 --> 03:30:44,030
Did they crash.

1507
03:30:56,299 --> 03:30:56,860
Fuck you.

1508
03:31:06,909 --> 03:31:08,030
I'm gonna restart this.

1509
03:31:08,829 --> 03:31:28,110
What is going on.

1510
03:31:28,110 --> 03:31:49,180
Oh okay I'm not doing that for 10 rounds.

1511
03:31:49,180 --> 03:31:51,260
Speed I want speed high.

1512
03:31:51,260 --> 03:32:05,950
All right just two laps and we'll go to I don't know whatever this is.

1513
03:32:05,950 --> 03:32:12,750
Cyprus I want speed.

1514
03:32:12,750 --> 03:32:16,079
Block hard turn right hard turn left.

1515
03:32:16,079 --> 03:32:16,799
All right let's go.

1516
03:32:16,799 --> 03:32:18,850
I can change the camera too.

1517
03:32:32,430 --> 03:32:34,829
Wait I was trying to get a funny angle.

1518
03:32:57,340 --> 03:32:59,020
Okay now we just have to keep pacing we're good.

1519
03:33:02,579 --> 03:33:05,170
What why am I so slow.

1520
03:33:06,260 --> 03:33:07,459
Why am I so slow.

1521
03:33:15,780 --> 03:33:16,579
Why am I so slow.

1522
03:33:17,299 --> 03:33:22,129
I have the fastest zebra in the.

1523
03:33:23,729 --> 03:33:24,770
Why am I going so slow.

1524
03:33:36,110 --> 03:33:37,549
Your stamina is too low.

1525
03:33:39,700 --> 03:33:58,260
What friend we're so slow.

1526
03:34:09,540 --> 03:34:10,819
Holy shit they went flying.

1527
03:34:13,020 --> 03:34:15,260
Oh my god okay okay okay okay.

1528
03:34:15,979 --> 03:34:21,709
We're still going we're still all right.

1529
03:34:23,360 --> 03:34:24,159
We're still fine.

1530
03:34:26,559 --> 03:34:28,479
It's the it's the horses that are doing all the work.

1531
03:34:38,100 --> 03:34:39,940
Oh look at that pace.

1532
03:34:44,940 --> 03:34:47,579
What that was blended into the environment.

1533
03:34:47,579 --> 03:34:49,020
That was blending into the environment.

1534
03:34:50,049 --> 03:35:11,280
That blended into the space.

1535
03:35:11,280 --> 03:35:18,639
This is still the first lap.

1536
03:35:40,989 --> 03:36:08,129
Wait they get the super speed boost.

1537
03:36:08,770 --> 03:36:22,639
First place let's go.

1538
03:36:22,639 --> 03:36:33,069
Fuck out of here.

1539
03:36:33,709 --> 03:36:46,270
It was nowhere to go.

1540
03:36:55,700 --> 03:36:56,819
What happened.

1541
03:36:58,239 --> 03:36:59,120
What happened.

1542
03:36:59,840 --> 03:37:06,459
I'm so pissed.

1543
03:37:07,180 --> 03:37:09,899
I'm so irrationally angry right now you've no idea.

1544
03:37:26,590 --> 03:37:44,909
Stop blocking.

1545
03:38:10,559 --> 03:38:12,559
I'm so fucking mad.

1546
03:38:12,559 --> 03:38:13,920
I'm so fucking mad.

1547
03:38:14,799 --> 03:38:32,319
We're going outside shortcut.

1548
03:38:33,899 --> 03:38:35,420
More dangerous but it's a shortcut for sure.

1549
03:38:35,420 --> 03:38:35,899
Look at that.

1550
03:38:36,540 --> 03:39:19,659
What are you talking about.

1551
03:39:19,659 --> 03:39:30,000
What no I wanted to go down that one.

1552
03:39:30,000 --> 03:39:31,040
I didn't want to go this way.

1553
03:39:41,260 --> 03:39:48,530
Boost I you saw me duck.

1554
03:39:48,530 --> 03:39:49,569
You saw me duck.

1555
03:39:49,569 --> 03:39:50,610
You saw me duck.

1556
03:39:50,610 --> 03:39:51,329
You saw me.

1557
03:39:51,889 --> 03:39:53,569
I ducked why did you still hit him in the head.

1558
03:39:54,370 --> 03:40:23,260
What's the brake.

1559
03:40:23,260 --> 03:40:23,739
What's brake.

1560
03:40:23,739 --> 03:40:24,299
What's the brake.

1561
03:40:29,010 --> 03:40:30,049
I was sandwiched.

1562
03:40:30,049 --> 03:40:31,010
There was somebody on the left.

1563
03:40:31,010 --> 03:40:31,729
There was somebody on the right.

1564
03:40:31,729 --> 03:40:32,530
There was somebody behind me.

1565
03:40:32,530 --> 03:40:34,690
They were all sandwiching stabbing me.

1566
03:40:47,139 --> 03:41:13,170
No what did I just throw.

1567
03:41:13,170 --> 03:41:14,129
I just threw lightning.

1568
03:41:26,610 --> 03:41:26,930
That's it.

1569
03:41:27,569 --> 03:41:28,530
I think I just did it.

1570
03:41:49,659 --> 03:42:13,860
It's over not yet.

1571
03:42:13,860 --> 03:42:15,299
All right I have a lightning bolt.

1572
03:42:15,299 --> 03:42:17,299
I don't know what it does but I'm going to hold it to the very end.

1573
03:42:17,940 --> 03:42:23,420
Okay all right.

1574
03:42:23,420 --> 03:42:27,340
Okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay.

1575
03:42:28,219 --> 03:42:30,219
Where is it.

1576
03:43:00,459 --> 03:43:05,170
This car sucks so bad.

1577
03:43:05,969 --> 03:43:21,860
Okay why when does the race end.

1578
03:43:22,579 --> 03:43:26,020
I feel like I'm on like lap six.

1579
03:45:04,739 --> 03:45:06,340
Arcade race.

1580
03:45:06,340 --> 03:45:11,459
Wait oh no that's that's what it's called career.

1581
03:45:11,459 --> 03:45:14,180
I mean no I'm not doing a career.

1582
03:45:14,180 --> 03:45:18,879
That was fun.

1583
03:45:18,879 --> 03:45:21,840
That was worth for sure that was worth playing.

1584
03:45:21,840 --> 03:45:23,840
All right it's time for you guys to take a vote here.

1585
03:45:23,840 --> 03:45:37,069
Are we going to play Indiana Jones and the Emperor's Tomb or Driver Parallel Lines.

1586
03:45:41,569 --> 03:45:42,450
What do you think.

1587
03:45:42,450 --> 03:45:51,760
I've seen a lot of both though.

1588
03:45:51,760 --> 03:45:52,479
Let's see.

1589
03:45:53,600 --> 03:45:55,840
Indiana Jones or Driver Parallel Lines.

1590
03:45:55,840 --> 03:46:00,860
Oh this actually is a lot of people that want both.

1591
03:46:09,149 --> 03:46:12,270
You've played the driver game already on stream.

1592
03:46:23,120 --> 03:46:27,200
Jerma plays Driver Parallel Lines.

1593
03:46:27,760 --> 03:46:37,950
No I didn't.

1594
03:46:37,950 --> 03:46:40,829
I didn't.

1595
03:46:40,829 --> 03:46:42,270
Maybe a different driver game.

1596
03:46:42,270 --> 03:46:44,190
I think this one's only on the original Xbox.

1597
03:46:44,190 --> 03:46:46,030
I don't think this one's backwards compatible.

1598
03:46:46,909 --> 03:46:47,709
All right what are we doing.

1599
03:46:48,350 --> 03:46:53,860
Pretty close but we're doing Driver Parallel Lines.

1600
03:46:53,860 --> 03:46:55,459
We'll do Indiana Jones after that.

1601
03:46:57,090 --> 03:46:57,649
Well we'll see.

1602
03:46:58,290 --> 03:46:58,930
Let's see.

1603
03:46:58,930 --> 03:46:59,809
All right driver coming up.

1604
03:47:00,450 --> 03:47:03,360
No burning.

1605
03:47:16,799 --> 03:47:23,280
Driver 4 is Parallel Lines.

1606
03:47:23,280 --> 03:47:24,559
Driver is Parallel Lines.

1607
03:47:27,090 --> 03:47:28,129
You played Driver already.

1608
03:47:28,129 --> 03:47:29,090
I played Driver 1.

1609
03:47:29,649 --> 03:47:31,569
I didn't play the other ones.

1610
03:47:31,569 --> 03:47:35,040
We'll see whatever it is.

1611
03:47:35,040 --> 03:47:36,000
I don't know.

1612
03:47:36,559 --> 03:47:39,360
Tell me I've played this before.

1613
03:47:39,920 --> 03:47:42,030
I don't believe you.

1614
03:47:42,030 --> 03:47:47,809
What did you say?

1615
03:47:49,340 --> 03:47:50,459
You googled yourself.

1616
03:47:51,500 --> 03:47:53,579
I'm googling to see if there's a video of it.

1617
03:47:53,579 --> 03:47:59,440
Guys I've played thousands of video games

1618
03:47:59,520 --> 03:48:02,930
and I've made thousands of videos

1619
03:48:02,930 --> 03:48:04,290
over the course of 13 years.

1620
03:48:04,290 --> 03:48:05,489
12, 13 years.

1621
03:48:05,489 --> 03:48:09,010
I've streamed millions of different pieces of frames

1622
03:48:09,010 --> 03:48:10,209
have gone into my brain.

1623
03:48:10,209 --> 03:48:12,030
I don't remember.

1624
03:48:12,030 --> 03:48:12,750
Maybe I mean yeah.

1625
03:48:13,549 --> 03:48:14,909
There's like seven of these games.

1626
03:48:14,909 --> 03:48:16,190
Maybe I played one of them.

1627
03:48:16,190 --> 03:48:17,600
I don't know.

1628
03:48:17,600 --> 03:48:21,379
Do you know how many frames have gone in here?

1629
03:48:21,379 --> 03:48:37,379
How many actual animation frames have gone into my head?

1630
03:48:37,379 --> 03:48:37,780
Driver.

1631
03:48:37,780 --> 03:48:41,059
So the way Driver Parallel Lines.

1632
03:48:41,059 --> 03:48:43,139
Driver Parallel 4 is what I just said.

1633
03:48:43,139 --> 03:48:46,620
Driver Parallel Lines is just Driver 4.

1634
03:48:46,860 --> 03:48:48,139
How come it didn't say that on the box?

1635
03:48:48,700 --> 03:49:26,270
I don't think it is.

1636
03:49:26,270 --> 03:49:26,750
Right.

1637
03:49:26,750 --> 03:49:27,790
I remember this.

1638
03:49:29,889 --> 03:49:31,809
Okay I remember this now.

1639
03:49:32,450 --> 03:49:33,700
Drop me in Harlem.

1640
03:49:39,899 --> 03:49:41,659
One way or enough.

1641
03:50:30,000 --> 03:50:31,440
Liquor stores huh?

1642
03:50:31,440 --> 03:50:33,600
That mean you're on your way up or your way down.

1643
03:50:34,479 --> 03:51:05,819
I've already played this.

1644
03:51:05,819 --> 03:51:07,100
We're gonna do Indiana Jones.

1645
03:51:07,100 --> 03:51:17,600
I've already played it.

1646
03:51:17,600 --> 03:51:19,739
So wait so Driver 4.

1647
03:51:19,739 --> 03:51:22,139
I just maybe I thought oh I played Driver 4

1648
03:51:22,139 --> 03:51:24,379
because the name of the video was Driver 4.

1649
03:51:24,379 --> 03:51:27,200
So when I was like oh Driver Parallel Lines.

1650
03:51:27,200 --> 03:51:28,959
That's a different spin-off Driver game

1651
03:51:28,959 --> 03:51:30,000
that I've never played before.

1652
03:51:42,079 --> 03:51:50,190
Just put up a gameplay video and react to it.

1653
03:51:50,190 --> 03:51:50,510
All right.

1654
03:51:50,510 --> 03:52:15,360
Indiana Jones for the Xbox.

1655
03:52:15,360 --> 03:52:16,639
Adventure has a name.

1656
03:52:16,639 --> 03:52:22,430
Let me ask in the mod chat is he okay?

1657
03:52:23,680 --> 03:52:24,479
I drive.

1658
03:52:24,479 --> 03:52:28,719
Guys I've seen hundreds of billions of frames.

1659
03:52:29,809 --> 03:52:32,209
The amount of data that's been from this screen

1660
03:52:32,209 --> 03:52:34,209
put into here and me streaming it.

1661
03:52:35,420 --> 03:52:36,540
I've played.

1662
03:52:36,540 --> 03:52:37,819
Does anyone want to count the amount of games

1663
03:52:37,819 --> 03:52:39,819
I've played on stream or on YouTube?

1664
03:52:40,700 --> 03:52:42,860
It has to be at least like two or three thousand.

1665
03:52:43,500 --> 03:52:44,700
It has to be thousands of them.

1666
03:52:45,260 --> 03:52:46,299
At least two or three thousand.

1667
03:52:46,860 --> 03:52:52,989
Is it gonna get DMCA too?

1668
03:52:58,690 --> 03:53:00,530
Just say you forgot like a normal person.

1669
03:53:00,530 --> 03:53:01,760
I did.

1670
03:53:01,760 --> 03:53:02,799
That's and I'm just explaining.

1671
03:53:08,110 --> 03:53:12,129
All right we're good.

1672
03:53:12,129 --> 03:53:14,209
You are obliterated right now.

1673
03:53:20,690 --> 03:53:28,540
All right is it Harrison Ford?

1674
03:53:28,540 --> 03:53:43,569
Oh it should be that same guy that did Tom Hanks.

1675
03:53:43,569 --> 03:53:45,299
That'd be great.

1676
03:53:45,299 --> 03:54:18,979
I played this growing up.

1677
03:54:18,979 --> 03:54:19,860
It kind of sucks.

1678
03:54:33,299 --> 03:54:48,959
Pretty good.

1679
03:54:48,959 --> 03:54:50,079
You gotta check.

1680
03:54:50,079 --> 03:54:58,079
This guy has three acting credits.

1681
03:54:58,079 --> 03:55:00,459
They're all Harrison Ford.

1682
03:55:00,459 --> 03:55:05,659
Great doing a pretty damn good job.

1683
03:55:06,219 --> 03:55:33,180
So many of these games would just ledge grab Andes.

1684
03:55:33,180 --> 03:55:33,979
You know what I mean?

1685
03:55:33,979 --> 03:55:38,319
Like I said oh grab the ledge and pull yourself up the ledge.

1686
03:55:38,319 --> 03:55:47,569
Okay let me see.

1687
03:55:47,569 --> 03:55:48,690
He's so tired already.

1688
03:55:48,690 --> 03:55:50,850
No I'm I'm not tired right now.

1689
03:55:51,409 --> 03:55:53,090
What do you mean he's so tired?

1690
03:55:53,090 --> 03:56:05,299
Can I press something?

1691
03:56:05,299 --> 03:56:23,969
This water to fill up my canteen.

1692
03:56:23,969 --> 03:56:28,670
Can you drink it?

1693
03:56:28,670 --> 03:56:36,100
Why does it smell bad?

1694
03:56:36,100 --> 03:56:40,989
Why is he he's like uh there's gonna be an awesome cat puke here.

1695
03:56:40,989 --> 03:56:42,030
Be ready to clip it.

1696
03:56:42,030 --> 03:56:44,909
Be ready to clip this cat puke because you know it's coming.

1697
03:56:44,909 --> 03:57:15,780
How do I use that?

1698
03:57:15,780 --> 03:58:10,430
How do I use this machete?

1699
03:58:10,430 --> 03:58:11,950
You don't have one.

1700
03:58:11,950 --> 03:58:20,110
But didn't he say I'm gonna use my machete?

1701
03:58:20,110 --> 03:58:22,030
He didn't he say I'm gonna use my machete?

1702
03:58:22,030 --> 03:58:24,190
Or did he say I need to use a machete?

1703
03:58:24,190 --> 03:58:44,159
Oh let me do the yeah yeah every game had this shit.

1704
03:58:44,159 --> 03:58:55,739
Even Super Mario.

1705
03:58:55,739 --> 03:58:56,860
That's punch not jump.

1706
03:58:58,110 --> 03:59:20,190
B is jump.

1707
03:59:20,190 --> 03:59:29,760
Thank god machete.

1708
03:59:30,319 --> 03:59:52,000
Okay that's actually really good to know.

1709
03:59:52,000 --> 04:00:41,840
Mm-hmm that looked dangerous.

1710
04:00:41,840 --> 04:00:48,270
This is so boring now because I'm now aware of how long the ledge climbing is.

1711
04:00:48,270 --> 04:00:48,829
Thanks.

1712
04:00:48,829 --> 04:00:53,340
This game looks incredibly boring.

1713
04:00:53,899 --> 04:00:54,780
Not really.

1714
04:00:54,780 --> 04:00:55,739
It's just a game.

1715
04:00:55,739 --> 04:00:56,940
It's just a video game.

1716
04:01:00,399 --> 04:01:01,440
There's a jump.

1717
04:01:01,440 --> 04:01:02,000
There's a run.

1718
04:01:02,000 --> 04:01:03,760
There's a there's a slash.

1719
04:01:03,760 --> 04:01:10,850
We want driver.

1720
04:01:10,850 --> 04:01:12,610
We want driver parallel lines.

1721
04:01:12,610 --> 04:01:15,840
We want driver parallel lines.

1722
04:01:15,840 --> 04:01:28,909
These guys are no boy scouts.

1723
04:01:28,909 --> 04:01:34,559
According to the German video ran 4,800 hours of video.

1724
04:01:35,860 --> 04:01:40,260
Okay so 4,809 hours of video with the assumption that he's running at

1725
04:01:40,340 --> 04:01:41,059
60 hertz.

1726
04:01:41,620 --> 04:01:46,430
German has personally viewed over one million.

1727
04:01:46,430 --> 04:01:47,940
Is it billion?

1728
04:01:47,940 --> 04:01:51,059
That's one billion individual frames.

1729
04:01:51,059 --> 04:01:55,620
If it was 144 hertz it would be 2.4 billion individual frames.

1730
04:01:57,090 --> 04:01:57,889
Damn.

1731
04:01:57,889 --> 04:02:11,280
And that's what just makes it into videos.

1732
04:02:11,280 --> 04:02:11,840
Right.

1733
04:02:11,840 --> 04:02:15,600
And he can't remember the last 100.

1734
04:02:15,600 --> 04:02:21,459
Wait till you get older.

1735
04:02:21,459 --> 04:02:22,340
You'll see.

1736
04:02:22,340 --> 04:02:25,790
So wait till you get older.

1737
04:02:25,790 --> 04:02:26,909
Wait till you get a little older.

1738
04:02:27,549 --> 04:02:29,569
You'll see.

1739
04:02:37,069 --> 04:02:38,430
You're not gonna remember.

1740
04:02:38,430 --> 04:02:39,309
Yeah guys sorry.

1741
04:02:39,309 --> 04:02:44,030
I I mean I don't I remember kind of playing Spelunky when it came out.

1742
04:02:44,030 --> 04:02:46,590
But like I forgot that until I just thought about it.

1743
04:02:46,590 --> 04:03:01,120
I already have.

1744
04:03:01,120 --> 04:03:02,879
Yeah my memory is already bad.

1745
04:03:02,879 --> 04:03:04,340
Can I sneak?

1746
04:03:25,010 --> 04:03:44,319
How do I beat am I just gonna get it?

1747
04:03:50,559 --> 04:04:01,520
Get out of the menu dude.

1748
04:04:01,520 --> 04:04:02,879
All right sounds good.

1749
04:04:02,879 --> 04:04:19,340
Who made this game?

1750
04:04:19,340 --> 04:04:21,819
Hey it's me the American.

1751
04:04:21,819 --> 04:04:23,500
Everything you heard is true.

1752
04:04:23,500 --> 04:04:41,020
The fire killed me.

1753
04:04:41,020 --> 04:04:48,879
What the fuck is this garbage?

1754
04:04:48,879 --> 04:04:57,250
All right one last try.

1755
04:04:57,250 --> 04:05:09,420
One last try.

1756
04:05:09,420 --> 04:05:12,899
Guys they made the DaVinci code.

1757
04:05:12,899 --> 04:05:14,020
Same company.

1758
04:05:14,819 --> 04:05:21,100
Have I played all their games today?

1759
04:05:21,100 --> 04:05:23,809
They made Men in Black the game.

1760
04:05:23,809 --> 04:05:26,209
Star Trek Deep Space Nine.

1761
04:05:26,209 --> 04:05:28,129
Buffy the Vampire Slayer.

1762
04:05:28,129 --> 04:05:30,260
Indiana Jones.

1763
04:05:30,260 --> 04:05:31,620
Wrath Unleashed.

1764
04:05:31,620 --> 04:05:34,690
Star Wars Episode 3.

1765
04:05:34,690 --> 04:05:37,280
Mark Echoes Getting Up.

1766
04:05:37,280 --> 04:05:39,540
The DaVinci code.

1767
04:05:39,540 --> 04:05:47,579
And then a cancelled game called Dirty Harry.

1768
04:05:47,579 --> 04:05:48,139
Interesting.

1769
04:05:52,129 --> 04:05:53,329
Interesting okay.

1770
04:05:54,340 --> 04:05:54,819
Very cool.

1771
04:06:37,780 --> 04:06:39,889
How do I reload the gun?

1772
04:06:39,889 --> 04:07:03,059
All right the game just got way better.

1773
04:07:03,059 --> 04:07:13,090
Because I can I get a chair.

1774
04:07:13,090 --> 04:07:14,610
Uh what is this?

1775
04:07:14,610 --> 04:07:17,180
Can I dig?

1776
04:07:41,260 --> 04:07:54,700
Let's try to do that.

1777
04:07:54,700 --> 04:08:02,110
It's doing that music.

1778
04:08:02,110 --> 04:08:04,350
It's doing the Star Wars type music.

1779
04:08:04,350 --> 04:08:08,430
The one that goes

1780
04:08:11,579 --> 04:08:22,719
And it is the best.

1781
04:08:36,260 --> 04:08:46,420
Press Y.

1782
04:08:48,579 --> 04:08:50,450

We're good.

1785
04:09:15,620 --> 04:09:26,459
I remember this game on PS2.

1786
04:09:26,459 --> 04:09:28,780
It sucks balls.

1787
04:09:28,780 --> 04:09:37,790
That's such like a ridiculous term.

1788
04:09:37,790 --> 04:09:40,209
Like oh I played this before too.

1789
04:09:40,209 --> 04:09:41,489

Oh this thing sucks ass.

04:10:20,850 --> 04:10:22,049
Like how weird this is.

1796
04:10:22,049 --> 04:11:01,549
And dog shit.

1797
04:11:01,549 --> 04:11:03,389
It wasn't even good.

1798
04:11:03,389 --> 04:11:12,860

1799
04:11:12,860 --> 04:11:25,620

04:16:43,809 --> 04:16:45,250
What about the Fellowship of the Ring?

1824

1834
04:17:47,889 --> 04:17:59,969
I probably played a long time ago I like the Xbox pause screen yeah I do too I just want to

1835
04:17:59,969 --> 04:18:07,409
make sure it's not here for that long because it burns into my screen legacy of Kane is real

1836
04:18:07,409 --> 04:18:17,579
shit okay well I think that's what you're voting for so we're gonna play legacy of Kane Blood Omen

1837
04:18:18,139 --> 04:18:23,360
2.

1838
04:18:26,299 --> 04:18:28,059
All right let's try it.

1839
04:18:28,059 --> 04:18:38,270
Soul Reaver on PS1 was really cool.

1840
04:18:38,829 --> 04:18:48,059
I feel like I remember that game is this stuff still burned in from the first day

1841
04:18:48,059 --> 04:18:52,879
no thankfully it turning the monitor off for a day or two helps it fixes it

1842
04:18:58,559 --> 04:19:06,850
yikes okay sorry so glad I turned that down because that was awful for me

1843
04:19:15,860 --> 04:19:25,920
Crystal Dynamics look at all these game studios that we all know Crystal Dynamics made this

1844
04:19:26,559 --> 04:19:54,899
this is Blood Omen 2 so we're we're jumping in like the third or fourth sequel of the game at

1845
04:19:54,899 --> 04:20:19,299
this point sorry we don't know what's going on they made the Avengers game this is on Steam

1846
04:20:19,299 --> 04:20:46,450
is it really cool you shouldn't be playing it I can't I'm being speech jammed I can't even

1847
04:20:46,450 --> 04:20:58,770
hear myself thinking somebody said you shouldn't you shouldn't be playing it if it's on PC yeah

1848
04:20:58,770 --> 04:21:18,979
but I mean I already put the disk in oh all right very cool let's go am I gonna get like obsessed

1849
04:21:18,979 --> 04:21:35,149
with this game yeah vibration on let's go am I hold and hold left trigger to block attacks

1850
04:21:35,149 --> 04:21:50,799
tap left trigger as each enemy attack starts I mean I feel like okay um it's a cat puke menu

1851
04:21:50,799 --> 04:22:07,520
maybe a little what's more fun I'll try the fun one yeah PC ports of old console games usually

1852
04:22:07,520 --> 04:22:13,059
are awful and the developer has not updated this for anything past like Windows 7 or something

1853
04:22:13,059 --> 04:22:16,860
so it's still a huge pain in the ass to actually get in that big problem this might be bugs

1854
04:22:16,860 --> 04:22:36,129
original hardware chapter one slums welcome to

1855
04:22:37,329 --> 04:22:51,170
Riddian it looks kind of crunchy it looks kind of crunchy

1856
04:23:11,729 --> 04:23:16,370
I could do it really good but I need the headphones out you want to do a good one

1857
04:23:17,090 --> 04:23:28,479
should I do a good one yes can I get a poll to see if I should do a good one yes or no

1858
04:23:28,479 --> 04:23:53,709
do you want me to go do an all-in all-bearer yes or no it's a checkpoint

1859
04:24:17,760 --> 04:24:23,280
we are in the oldest and most decrepit part of the city where few people dare to come

1860
04:24:23,280 --> 04:24:31,120
place to train train me you take me for a dog your memory has been shattered and your body

1861
04:24:31,120 --> 04:24:37,840
has lain dormant for 200 years what skills you had must be recovered before you can be of any

1862
04:24:37,840 --> 04:24:44,000
use to the cabal you must learn to fight and to survive I thought you were taking me to feed

1863
04:24:44,559 --> 04:24:52,059
patience vampire first knew that you are stronger and faster than mortal men oh there we go to jump

1864
04:24:52,059 --> 04:24:58,239
higher and farther than any human that ever lived wait what is this all bearer or all barely seek

1865
04:24:58,239 --> 04:25:08,299
for a place to jump all right 85 percent right now here we go I'm gonna go away from the mic

1866
04:25:08,299 --> 04:25:12,299
it's probably gonna be really really really annoying I go like this yeah I don't want to

1867
04:25:12,299 --> 04:25:27,420
be super awful I'm not gonna be on camera either oh oh my god I can't do it

1868
04:25:28,059 --> 04:25:42,020
chain chain he's your brother kane you destroy him pretty good pretty good I even doubt at the

1869
04:25:42,020 --> 04:25:50,270
end there actually even doubt pretty well at the end it was kind of rough at the beginning

1870
04:25:51,629 --> 04:26:05,729
dude you're scaring my dog yeah I told you I was I had to get away from the mic

1886
04:28:52,770 --> 04:29:15,229
I did it for like five seconds or so and we move on I missed it

1887
04:29:18,159 --> 04:29:25,780
hold on let me see how bad it really was people are like hurry up move on move on

1892
04:30:46,879 --> 04:31:15,069
let's play the game stop making us relive that what is going on right now you don't even know

1893
04:31:15,069 --> 04:31:23,200
who that is 75 percent of you don't know who paul bear is so I was just I just sounded like an

1894
04:31:23,200 --> 04:31:32,180
absolute what oh okay now that makes a lot more sense as to why everyone's like what's wrong with

04:32:29,549 --> 04:33:12,209
coming back okay x is pull the lever I thought it was from Star Trek when he goes no no it's

1900
04:33:12,209 --> 04:34:29,340
Kane one sec mod chat just linked this and I have to watch it I'm sorry if you're expecting a video

1901
04:34:29,340 --> 04:34:50,590
game to be played right now I do apologize but we need to watch this watch party I wish I could

1902
04:34:50,669 --> 04:35:22,340
apologize to those people that's not even close you could win a freak I'm already playing the

1903
04:35:22,340 --> 04:35:45,139
xbox right now all right that was I thought that was gonna be like a deep fake fan that person that

1904
04:35:45,139 --> 04:36:08,990
linked that okay all right let's play the game no more I'm not gonna have to scream anymore the

1905
04:36:08,990 --> 04:36:13,069
person that came in here like four hours ago hey dude scream as loud as you can hey I don't want

1906
04:36:13,069 --> 04:36:17,389
to do that I just did it because like I thought I think I thought like 15 000 people voted for it

1907
04:36:17,389 --> 04:36:22,430
but only a thousand people did and 17 000 people were sleeping and I just screamed and made them

1908
04:36:22,430 --> 04:36:47,060
wake up and now they hate me great he sought to move this victim but he met me instead

1909
04:36:49,229 --> 04:36:55,470
that was a good video actually loved and direct me to his throat drink then I will be waiting

1910
04:36:56,270 --> 04:37:07,090
no there's definitely not guys 90 percent of the audience does not sleep in a dead sleep

1911
04:37:07,090 --> 04:37:29,439
during the stream it's probably like five percent it's not that many if you are wounded seek out

1912
04:37:29,439 --> 04:37:36,619
blood to restore your vital must know too that by drinking the blood of others you will gradually

1913
04:37:36,619 --> 04:37:42,220
become stronger and harder to kill we call this a vampire's lore

1914
04:37:51,810 --> 04:38:22,799
you will need their blood to survive let us continue wait I thought that was like funny all

1915
04:38:22,880 --> 04:38:48,659
right remember your fly is done

1916
04:38:52,099 --> 04:39:05,659
while we are superior to humans in many ways we also have certain weaknesses that they do not

1917
04:39:05,659 --> 04:39:14,459
possess though it is life-giving to humans water is deadly to vampires its touch burns our skin

1918
04:39:15,020 --> 04:39:22,139
immersion in water can kill us avoid it at all costs also know that scattered throughout meridian

1919
04:39:22,299 --> 04:39:28,939
our relics of our ancestors useless to humans only vampires can access these coffins and use

1920
04:39:28,939 --> 04:39:46,770
the power within seek these out on your journey cool okay so don't just water if I could I if

1921
04:39:46,770 --> 04:39:57,139
I could go back and just delete the cane scream I would interested to go like shit I wish I could

1922
04:39:57,139 --> 04:40:02,180
I wish I could just go into the vod and just like just snip that part out and even if a jump cut

1923
04:40:02,180 --> 04:40:06,610
like people would be like what happened what why did that happen because I don't know must

1924
04:40:06,610 --> 04:40:29,040
make a glitch with the game or something he's so fixated on this Jesus am I supposed to be

1925
04:40:29,040 --> 04:40:45,779
drinking blood I think so thank god I wish I could go back in the vod and delete that part

1926
04:40:45,779 --> 04:40:55,380
just snip that part like just that right when I fell I have such a stupid idea okay I'm doing

1927
04:40:55,380 --> 04:41:01,700
it soon I'm gonna do it like within the next couple weeks I'm going to pre-record an entire

1928
04:41:01,700 --> 04:41:07,060
stream no I'm not even gonna tell you but you know what I'm gonna do I'm just gonna pre-record

1929
04:41:07,060 --> 04:41:22,560
a whole stream I just have to like cut all the shitty stuff that I do see how long see

1930
04:41:22,560 --> 04:41:29,970
what you what you guys do I spoke before that's called a YouTube video yeah but not the way you

1931
04:41:29,970 --> 04:41:41,099
think to destroy this they have developed special defenses you see here precisely does it do should

1932
04:41:41,099 --> 04:41:46,959
you so much as touch it you will be burned as by fire the seraphim have raised these wards

1933
04:41:46,959 --> 04:41:53,520
throughout meridian we can go no farther this way follow me into the sewer somebody's got it

1934
04:41:54,159 --> 04:42:08,880
yeah we're talking about as if I played through the game in one try like what kind of egomaniac

1935
04:42:08,880 --> 04:42:16,130
would you have to be what kind of megalomania of making it so I'm trying to make you guys think I

1936
04:42:16,130 --> 04:42:21,729
beat the game I did everything perfectly or something your first line of you have to be

1937
04:42:21,729 --> 04:42:30,659
kidding me give me a really hard game too using your inhuman speed you can also defend yourself

1938
04:42:30,659 --> 04:42:37,220
by blocking attacks I shall now strike at you this is what I said did I say megalomania

1939
04:42:38,180 --> 04:42:42,259
yeah you guys don't know what that is and we can proceed to the next lesson

1940
04:42:42,979 --> 04:43:01,790
press L to block oh this is the the perfect timing one okay cool hey it's not that bad

1941
04:43:09,729 --> 04:43:16,770
we are all armed with a natural weapon our claws use them to kill your enemies

1942
04:43:17,490 --> 04:43:37,459
you can practice by attacking me if you see an enemy become tired use this opportunity

1943
04:43:37,459 --> 04:43:48,450
to grab him once grabbed you can throw him a great distance hold and hold press Y to grab

1944
04:43:49,009 --> 04:44:16,819
and press wait are you doing like a choke oh okay excellent your lesson is over for the moment

1945
04:44:17,619 --> 04:44:23,380
continue through the sewer and I shall meet you again shortly that is unforgivable tonight

1946
04:44:24,340 --> 04:44:29,500
I think that everyone's been having fun I think everywhere chat's been all right

1947

1949
04:45:17,279 --> 04:45:24,419

are in camp number stands guard his fate approaches you must kill him kane you have

1951
04:45:33,360 --> 04:45:37,200
the skill to block and dodge his attacks first thing I see in chat is what I'm gonna eat tonight

1952
04:45:39,040 --> 04:45:45,119
once you have felled him drink his blood to restore yourself from any wounds you may receive

1953
04:45:45,119 --> 04:46:01,180
bagel I will be watching bagel look look look it was like chunks on this

1955
04:46:39,069 --> 04:46:45,580
but people just don't ever think to do it bagel sandwiches and I'm not just talking about egg

1956
04:46:45,580 --> 04:46:50,509
I'm talking about tuna like a tuna melt on a bagel ham sandwich on a bagel

1957
04:46:51,069 --> 04:47:08,029
especially if it's warmed up and toasted oh yeah ham and cheese on a bagel is perfect

1958
04:47:17,099 --> 04:47:22,139
these are our supernatural abilities bagel french dip I've never had that sounds good though

1959
04:47:23,580 --> 04:47:29,419
giving us unique powers much of your former power cane has been weakened during your long

1960
04:47:29,419 --> 04:47:36,479
hibernation mist you see here can be used to your advantage rubin on a bagel you have the

1961
04:47:36,479 --> 04:47:44,319
ability to assume a missed form and become nearly invisible you can move silently to bring down our

1962
04:47:44,319 --> 04:47:49,919
prey from behind cream cheese and locks at times when you are outnumbered look for mist from which

1963
04:47:49,919 --> 04:47:54,400
to kill your enemies I really have to be in the mood for that though if you are pursued you can

1964
04:47:54,400 --> 04:48:01,200
hide in mist to escape now use this gift to kill those before you in the cemetery

1965

04:50:46,000 --> 04:51:14,459
while holding a weapon doesn't hold to activate the weapon box while holding a weapon it's just

1973
04:51:14,459 --> 04:51:25,099
pretty good you should do a joke where you pretend that owls are in your room but you're the only one

1974
04:51:25,099 --> 04:51:34,819
that can hear them glyph energy eyes of the seraphim it supplies power to all of meridian

1975
04:51:35,540 --> 04:51:43,060
the gate you see can be opened using this energy activate the glyph box this will bring power to

1976
04:51:43,060 --> 04:52:24,659
the gates lever and allow you to open it it's fun it's fun oh 45 minutes without chapstick

1977
04:52:24,659 --> 04:52:31,139
what will you do if I do okay a secret society existing what do I get if I do that you may see

1978
04:52:31,139 --> 04:52:37,220
them working on glyphs from time to time they rarely talk with the townsfolk and very little

1979
04:52:37,220 --> 04:52:43,970
is known about their origins ahead is the market with a common dregs of meridian engage in their

1980
04:52:43,970 --> 04:52:50,369
filthy commerce beyond the market is the bridge that leads to the lower city make your way east

1981
04:52:50,369 --> 04:52:57,020
to the bridge I shall meet you there and where are you going I shall scout ahead to ensure that

1982
04:52:57,020 --> 04:53:03,099
you don't meet any seraphim patrols you aren't ready for them yet how trusting of you to leave

1983
04:53:03,099 --> 04:53:11,360
me to my own devices consider it an act of good will how many tubes of chapstick do you go through

1984
04:53:12,240 --> 04:53:18,139
um actually quite a few not because I use it too much but because I actually just lose them

1985
04:53:18,779 --> 04:53:24,139
they just disappear I'll use the same one for a week and then it's gone it does not exist

1986
04:53:24,860 --> 04:54:50,819
what's that try drink everybody's blood should I what was that powering stop this is why I

1987
04:54:50,819 --> 04:54:57,500
fucking hate streaming outside it's so annoying having just like an open roof screaming an open

1988
04:54:57,500 --> 04:55:00,860
roof germa streaming an open roof like you told you complain about your room being so hot just

1989
04:55:00,860 --> 04:55:06,979
take the roof off because I figured that'd be like still privacy and shit never listening to

1990
04:55:06,979 --> 04:56:26,349
you fucking idiots ever again I can't go in this what is it powering up here I'm bored um

1991
04:56:26,909 --> 04:56:31,709
I'm just kind of chilling out now I think we hit the peak with the pallbearer scream and now I'm

1992
04:56:31,709 --> 04:56:36,189
just like kind of you know I'm just chill I got all that out of me you know what I mean

1993
04:56:36,189 --> 04:57:08,020
just relax it now how much longer um at least until the chapstick wears off because I can't

1994
04:57:08,020 --> 04:57:21,090
leave for at least 45 minutes there are animals here all right this is fun but I am I'll do

1995
04:57:21,090 --> 04:57:26,340
something else it's a cool game I could see myself just sitting on the couch just playing this

1996
04:57:26,340 --> 04:57:58,939
it's very cool but I think I need to play it it's almost like jumping through a glass window

1997
04:57:59,580 --> 04:58:25,599
you've never loathed a game more in your life that's not true

1998
04:58:25,599 --> 04:58:44,930
hear this so-called leader's plans and learn what he thought his plans might be for me

1999
04:58:45,729 --> 04:58:53,569
cain this way I'm gonna play this game called maximum chase here close the gate

2000
04:58:56,770 --> 04:59:02,779
cain way to reach the lower city the smuggler's tunnel will take you there

2001
04:59:02,779 --> 04:59:11,150
pestilent vampire the grand hotel in the slums a contact will meet you there

2002
04:59:11,150 --> 04:59:17,630
he will tell you where to go stinking verminous bloodsucking fiend do you want your death now

2003
04:59:18,509 --> 04:59:27,549
come and you shall have it come back I was alone at last in a city changed beyond all recognition

2004
04:59:27,549 --> 04:59:34,189
in a lab like links should I flinks is available on the newer platform isn't it

2005
04:59:35,150 --> 04:59:39,630
I think you can play it on the game pass but answers were promised me in sanctuary

2006
04:59:39,630 --> 04:59:51,330
after that I would know what to do that's a good one that's pretty good keep going

2007
04:59:51,889 --> 05:00:24,740
I'm gonna put maximum chase yeah it's on game pass that was literally sick hair flick you guys

2008
05:00:24,740 --> 05:00:29,220
fumbled voting for that vampire game no that game is actually a classic video game it's actually

2009
05:00:29,220 --> 05:00:38,189
really good but I feel like it I don't know if I want to play um legacy of cain for like

2010
05:00:39,250 --> 05:00:49,580
20 hours takes a bit to ramp up all right what about this one

2073
05:35:08,340 --> 05:35:24,900
this time it's just a truck replacing the other car I'm gonna give this one attempt only we are

2074
05:35:24,900 --> 05:36:46,290
going one attempt only the rest of the game how smooth no I feel like the game is generating the

2075
05:36:46,290 --> 05:37:00,180
level 15 feet in front of me I don't know where I'm going but if the levels just here I please do

2076
05:37:00,180 --> 05:37:09,709
an ASMR video with this game okay so what we're gonna do here is some very quick mouth noises for

2077
05:37:09,709 --> 05:37:14,750
you to help you sleep I know you're listening to this because it helps you sleep at night

2078
05:37:16,400 --> 05:37:36,000
some stuff in the background don't pay attention to me talking so pop pop did I do a full circle

2079
05:37:36,560 --> 05:37:48,959
that was a meditation just what I want you to do is I want you to breathe in through your nose

2080
05:37:48,959 --> 05:37:56,450
and out through your mouth we'll do it at the same time you and me ready so here we go it's in

2081
05:37:57,169 --> 05:38:08,099
the first second here and then now very very nice excellent breathing so now what I want you to do

2082
05:38:08,099 --> 05:38:15,549
is I want you to breathe in again that's right pay attention to what I have I haven't known the

2083
05:38:15,549 --> 05:38:22,400
direction I'm supposed to be driving for the last five straight minutes I'm telling you the game

2084
05:38:22,400 --> 05:39:10,659
is being created in front of me I somehow made it but we're not watching this hey we get to keep

2085
05:39:10,659 --> 05:39:28,189
going home sweet home I'll just take a quick look around stay in the car and be ready to roll

2086
05:39:29,919 --> 05:39:39,090
that window amically huge is it well it's a big truck never mind officially hit 45 minutes without

2087
05:39:39,090 --> 05:40:14,319
a chapstick why are these cars like weird bugs this camera shake is so it doesn't need to be

2088
05:40:14,319 --> 05:40:24,189
that much they were so afraid of you seeing the outline of the green screen they were terrified

2089
05:40:24,189 --> 05:40:45,259
of it are we still going it's a shooting mission first try if I don't get it first try I'm done

that would be what a germa compilation in the top right corner what what do you mean germa

2112
05:56:37,299 --> 05:57:06,319
compilation how do you fit shit in here what do you want what do you what video do you want me to

2113
05:57:06,319 --> 05:57:36,400
put on put temple run gameplay at the bottom put on germa craft no how about a bird cam I think

2114
05:57:36,400 --> 05:57:55,860
that works all right like just bird cam like birds bird cam germa's worst face and worst

2115
05:57:55,860 --> 05:58:02,689
moment you're laughing at vehicle accidents okay hold on I'll put this one on to see if it we're

2116
05:58:02,689 --> 05:58:11,790
gonna see if it matches okay wait I'm interested in this so keep in mind I I cannot hear it so I

2117
05:58:11,790 --> 05:58:18,700
don't know how much it matches up I cannot hear it this is apparently me laughing at vehicle accidents

2118
05:58:23,229 --> 05:59:07,919
how loud is this though this is gonna be so stupid okay fine okay how's the audio good

2119

05:59:37,229 --> 05:59:43,790
so if you don't mind how about we mind besides they'll only come after you next

2121
05:59:43,790 --> 05:59:55,360
I don't want to put it louder you're trying to turn this off everybody so you're a singer huh

2122
05:59:56,080 --> 06:00:07,040
yeah I haven't released my CD yet but when I sing I use the name Malvina we need to wait

2123
06:00:07,840 --> 06:01:01,900
okay here we go let's go I'm going to get ADHD is it too loud I know it doesn't look like it

2124
06:01:01,900 --> 06:01:08,159
I think it's okay this is a great stream germa yeah you meant that as an insult I think but I

2125
06:01:08,159 --> 06:01:58,509
think it's fun all right let's go let's go let's go let's go I'm putting a stop to this right now

2126
06:01:59,150 --> 06:02:13,970
I'm putting a stop to this right now I somebody said to put slime videos like the people who

2127
06:02:13,970 --> 06:02:23,299
they play with this you know what I'm gonna tell you guys something because I think have I

2128
06:02:23,299 --> 06:02:28,419
talked about this before I don't care about leaking shit because who cares I'm definitely

2129
06:02:28,419 --> 06:02:33,779
not gonna do it at this point but maybe maybe somebody will maybe someone will did I talk about

2130
06:02:35,599 --> 06:02:46,459
spending like years straight making children's videos for YouTube and don't tell anyone and just

2131
06:02:46,459 --> 06:02:50,860
see how long it takes for people to figure it out I did I've talked about that right

2132
06:02:52,900 --> 06:02:59,840
a long time ago I wanted to do like double time streaming this is the part with maybe like four

2133
06:02:59,840 --> 06:03:04,799
or five years ago I wanted to stream and have a different YouTube channel where I just made

2134
06:03:05,439 --> 06:03:13,740
children's videos as a different person and still stream the same amount of time that I do

2135
06:03:13,740 --> 06:03:19,360
but have this like kids kind of content where I was doing like all kinds of like wacky stuff

2136
06:03:19,360 --> 06:03:25,619
it's like oh mr goofball and make hundreds of videos hundreds of them hundreds of them

2137
06:03:26,340 --> 06:03:32,560
and see how long it took before people figured it out because you know that if I did this for

2138
06:03:32,560 --> 06:03:43,979
like two or three years and eventually everybody found it it would be like what what are you doing

2139
06:03:43,979 --> 06:03:48,380
you mean to tell me that there is it there are there are years worth of children's videos that

2140
06:03:48,380 --> 06:03:53,659
you've made high production value by the way not dog shit not just like five seconds we're talking

2141
06:03:53,659 --> 06:04:01,569
like 10 to 15 minute long real educational shit and there would be like five or six hundred videos

2142
06:04:01,569 --> 06:04:10,060
over the course of five years I wanted to do it so bad but it was just too much work it's okay don't

2143
06:04:10,060 --> 06:04:17,279
worry yeah why children's videos I don't know because like I had this thing in my brain where

2144
06:04:17,279 --> 06:04:23,520
like I was gonna see if I could hit a billion views on that channel before before like germa

2145
06:04:23,520 --> 06:04:29,569
985 hit like I don't know like a certain amount of subs or something I was gonna play this internal

2146
06:04:29,569 --> 06:04:36,860
game with myself see if I could hit like a billion views that with like children's videos

2147
06:04:36,860 --> 06:04:51,459
see if I could like overtake the other channel why not elderly videos what what do you mean yeah

2148
06:04:51,459 --> 06:04:57,680
why well that's a good question to ask yourself a bill yeah I was thinking I could get like a

2149
06:04:57,680 --> 06:05:07,970
billion views a billion of them a billion views a billion of those views how many views are on the

2150
06:05:07,970 --> 06:05:11,330
regular channel how many views are on the regular channel like just like the germa 95 youtube

2151
06:05:11,409 --> 06:05:21,310
channel 500 million 300 million I could have gotten to a billion views a billion

2152
06:05:21,310 --> 06:05:45,869
let's say this two or three forms 250 million I could have done it dude you've gone completely

2153
06:05:45,869 --> 06:05:52,380
off the deep end I would you know what I would have real no wouldn't have been slime videos

2154
06:05:52,380 --> 06:05:56,299
it wouldn't have been slime videos it would have been like high quality children's entertainment

2155
06:05:56,299 --> 06:06:01,900
I would have made sure that it was like the best videos I was gonna make like characters and

2156
06:06:03,040 --> 06:06:07,439
and like puppets and shit like it was gonna be awesome it was gonna be truly fun

2157
06:06:08,849 --> 06:06:14,689
dinosaur videos you oh yeah animated stuff I was gonna really go all into it I was gonna go all

2158
06:06:14,689 --> 06:06:36,720
up the channel has 224 million views the auto show that's exactly what I mean auto show would

2159
06:06:36,720 --> 06:06:48,020
have been perfect I would have done the voice and everything too aren't you already making

2160
06:06:48,020 --> 06:07:05,419
videos for children no no no that's not true actually second germa has 245 million

2161
06:07:06,060 --> 06:07:25,330
so I got about half a billion views across the two youtube channels what just happened why is

2162
06:07:25,330 --> 06:07:43,090
this helicopter in such a weird spot I lost all right that's it I'm done I think it would have

2163
06:07:43,090 --> 06:07:57,659
been fun yeah I think it's a good place to call it I'm hungry I'm getting hungry well I apologize

2164
06:07:57,659 --> 06:08:01,340
to the 2000 people that left when I screamed the pallbearer thing hopefully you don't hate me

2165
06:08:01,340 --> 06:08:12,080
forever do a children's show stream I mean there's yeah I trust me I've thought about it where the

2166
06:08:12,080 --> 06:08:22,240
stream just turns on and it's just a it's just like a sesame street show and it's not I don't

2167
06:08:22,240 --> 06:08:26,319
we don't talk about just like yeah of course of course I'm gonna do like a children's entertainment

2168
06:08:26,319 --> 06:08:37,869
stream and it wouldn't be funny it's not gonna be funny like oh is what a funny no no no no

2172
06:09:18,830 --> 06:09:26,830

a pretty simple thing we're gonna test it a little bit so that's Saturday we'll see you Saturday uh

2182
06:10:52,639 --> 06:10:58,930
I think we're starting at two so 2 p.m pacific what is randomizer it is every single enemy and

2183
06:10:58,930 --> 06:11:04,220
every single item could be wrong but it's every enemy in the game is completely randomized it

2184
06:11:04,220 --> 06:11:10,209
could be a boss or it could just be like a rat you can walk out the front door and one of the

2185
06:11:10,209 --> 06:11:18,590
dragons just might be there just out out the front door good luck yeah that was some more xbox there

2186
06:11:18,590 --> 06:11:26,500
