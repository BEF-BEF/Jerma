1
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:12,730
Hey, sorry I didn't start. Sorry, I got lost in the mail, you know. I thought I could get

2
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:20,339
myself shipped here in a timely manner, but I got lost in the fucking mail. Look at this.

3
00:00:23,129 --> 00:00:28,660
But I bid you hello. Hope you had a good couple of days, three days here.

4
00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:37,320
Speaking of three days, we are going to do three days. That's one, two, three, in a row

5
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:47,179
of virtual reality. We're going to start today with Mind Show. If you don't know what Mind Show is,

6
00:00:47,899 --> 00:00:55,289
well, I'll tell you. You get in that headset and you act out scenes from movies that you

7
00:00:55,289 --> 00:01:04,969
make in your mind. I'm going to show you guys some of my acting chops. What's wrong with my

8
00:01:04,969 --> 00:01:12,439
desk? No, no, no, no, no. What is this? Why is there like goo on this desk? I use coasters

9
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:25,799
every time. I need to get like a desk cleaner. Oh, that sucks. What is this? I'm not happy about

10
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:34,310
that. Someone's in fucking deep shit. I don't know who did that. They're in deep fucking shit,

11
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:46,250
though. Let's see who comes in this room. Me. Anybody else come in this room? No, just me.

12
00:01:47,049 --> 00:01:52,840
You're in big trouble. I'm sorry, I didn't need to not use a coaster. Use a coaster

13
00:01:52,840 --> 00:02:04,500
next time, every time. Not next time, every time. No, not the top row. Anyways, let's turn

14
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:10,650
the camera on. You want to? No, not yet. I don't like that. I don't want to be on camera yet.

15
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:19,460
Not until I've had my coffee because I have to finish it. You know what? Fine, fuck it. Let's

16
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:32,039
just get on camera. That like, that like ultra gamer hunch. Did you see that? That was

17
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:36,439
almost like I was, somebody was holding me up by my neck like this, like pinching, like

18
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:41,939
that. Twitch TV. I got Twitch shirt on today. Just in case you didn't know where you were.

19
00:02:42,659 --> 00:02:50,629
That's all right. I got, I got the influencer shirt on. The thing is though, it's incredibly

20
00:02:50,629 --> 00:02:57,210
light. So it allows me to go like this. I had to prepare for this stream. Guys,

21
00:02:57,210 --> 00:03:02,580
I've been walking. I've been taking walks to prepare for this day. Remember last time I

22
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:10,340
streamed VR? I was, I kept going like this, like, no, I, I've been like moving.

23
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:18,550
It's been great. I've been taking like a 40 minute walk every day. I'm dead serious. That's

24
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:22,949
not a joke. This is not one of those scenarios where like Jeremy says something completely

25
00:03:22,949 --> 00:03:30,729
fucking untrue. And then we laugh about it in 40 minutes. No, I'm staying active. Get active.

26
00:03:33,669 --> 00:03:43,800
Facial hair? Yeah. I mean, I just, I just didn't care. I was thinking, here's the thing.

27
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:51,639
I don't, help me out here. How many of you guys hate the way that you look with a freshly

28
00:03:51,639 --> 00:04:00,330
shaved face? I hate it. I need like two days after shaving before I'm happy with what's

29
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:06,599
going on up here. I don't like it. So what happens is I, I know that I have to shave,

30
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:13,719
but I know that if I shave, I'm going to get that weird like crystal face. I don't like it.

31
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:19,079
So I usually try to wait like a day or two and then it's been like four days and then

32
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:27,050
four days turns into five and then it gets hard to do. Just trim it. No, I have an ugly

33
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:32,490
fucking beard. Look at this. Like this is, I grow facial hair here and like here and then

34
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:45,819
here. I don't grow facial hair here. It just looks like coal. Shaggy. Yeah, it doesn't look

35
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:52,220
good. I know people that can grow big thick beards up here. No, not me. I'm lucky if I

36
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:55,019
get, and if you look up close, I'm not going to do it because some people might be eating.

37
00:04:55,019 --> 00:05:00,220
So I'm not going to do that. But up close, see from here, this is, oh, he's just got like a

38
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:06,379
little beard today. If I go up close, you can see every individual disgusting hair and I know

39
00:05:06,379 --> 00:05:12,870
some of you, I probably snack it. So I don't want to make you throw up. Anyways, why don't

40
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:16,949
we go ahead and get this started? I've been here long enough. Let me just, hold on. I got

41
00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:26,939
to finish my coffee. Let me get this dog mug. You want to see it? You really want to see

42
00:05:26,939 --> 00:05:35,269
this? All right, fine. Let me, I'm going to be fair warning. If you've got like a ballamaze in

43
00:05:35,269 --> 00:05:40,810
front of you, put the fork down, get the bib off and just go like this. You don't want to see

44
00:05:40,810 --> 00:06:07,829
this. You see? This looks like I glued on hair on my face. See what I'm talking about?

45
00:06:09,879 --> 00:06:15,240
It looks like I went to the barber, right? I went to like the hair salon and like I'm

46
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:19,480
just like crawling on the ground. They're like cutting people's hair and I'm just like

47
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:22,759
picking up pieces and going like, oh, that's a good one. I like put that in my pocket

48
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:28,550
and then I get home and I like glue them on. It doesn't, it doesn't, it's all right.

49
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:40,379
He's covering the zit. No, I was stretching my, look, there's two there. I'm a human,

50
00:06:40,379 --> 00:06:44,699
okay? Some people want to pretend that they don't look like shit sometimes. I'm a human.

51
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:50,939
Humans look like shit. That's just the way it is, all right? So for those of you that

52
00:06:50,939 --> 00:06:55,980
have trouble seeing a guy with like a pimple right here, humans are gross. That's all you

53
00:06:55,980 --> 00:07:09,829
need to know. Do you have any gross things your body does on a daily basis? All right,

54
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:15,189
no, no, no, let's go. Let's go. I'm done with this shit. I'm picking up my VR headset. I

55
00:07:15,189 --> 00:07:20,920
don't want to be like, I gotta like get started. I don't want to talk about every

56
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:26,759
gross thing that we do. Saliva, think about it. Inside of your mouth right now

57
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:32,220
is a viscous liquid that is never ending and always is produced. That's disgusting.

58
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:37,589
It's gross. When are we going to get the ability to like sap the DNA from trees?

59
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:41,269
And I just want to become a tree person. I actually was talking to Kim about this two

60
00:07:41,269 --> 00:07:46,980
days ago so she can bounce for it. I probably swear to God. I was talking about trees and

61
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:53,850
how like I want to be like a tree. You had to be there, all right? You had to be there

62
00:07:54,410 --> 00:08:13,050
because trees don't have like, oh fucking nerd neck. Anyways, here we go. Let's get in

63
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:18,199
here. I gotta get, hold on, let me get these on first. Is this the right, is this the right

64
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:31,160
hand? I don't know. No, okay, this is right because you guys are on the left. We were

65
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:34,840
talking about, I can't even explain it. That's a very, that's for like a Monster

66
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:38,440
Rancher type stream, all right? Let's talk for 40 minutes on how I wish I could be a tree.

67
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:48,580
That's the title of a book. Are we sure that like Shel Silverstein didn't write this

68
00:08:48,580 --> 00:09:00,330
poem? I think he may have. I really think that exists. All right, is this going to work?

69
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:04,730
What's going on here? All right, I'm going in. This is Mind Show. Can you guys hear this?

70
00:09:05,529 --> 00:09:15,129
I hope so. You can still let me know. It's been a while. So give me a break. I don't know.

71
00:09:15,129 --> 00:09:20,789
Never mind. I was going to say never mind. I'm all over the place today but that's probably

72
00:09:20,789 --> 00:09:29,500
a good thing. I'm happy. It's a happy day. Oh, and before we get started, I want to show

73
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:42,840
you this. This came out of my faucet. Is this okay to drink? This came out of my,

74
00:09:42,919 --> 00:10:10,360
out of the tap. Is that okay? It's a fucking lemonade relax. Here we go. Yes, I know I'm

75
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:15,399
stalling and I'm going to continue to stall because you know how fucking bad I get in here.

76
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:29,879
My like life flashes before my eyes after two hours in VR. Oh, I just three stoogesed myself.

77
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:41,740
God damn it. Hey Larry, come here you chump. Give me a break. Oh, there you guys are.

78
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:51,289
No sound. I don't think there is sound right now. All right, so I'm in the right spot, right?

79
00:10:51,289 --> 00:10:57,960
Can you hear that? Now let's do a vocal warm up. Read this card at a normal volume.

80
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:21,379
Do robots have butts? Uh oh. Great. Now you're ready to play. All right, it worked.

81
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:29,320
Point and pull the trigger to start. So my show is what you'll see.

82
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:36,120
Hey there. Welcome to my show where you can remix and share crazy animated shows.

83
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:39,799
Let's watch a show and learn how to remix and share. Okay.

84
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:59,929
Easy. Great. Now your turn. Hit remix to start remixing. Is that the remix button?

85
00:12:01,419 --> 00:12:04,860
Remix. Point at the alien and pull the trigger to hop in.

86
00:12:05,899 --> 00:12:14,279
That's you now. You're an alien. Get comfortable. So I'm the alien now. How do I record?

87
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:19,080
Now you're ready to record. Try talking to yourself in the mirror. Make something up.

88
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:44,779
When you're ready, click record. How do I click record? Oh, right. You can do this today.

89
00:12:45,419 --> 00:12:49,179
You're going to go out there and you're going to show everybody what you're made of.

90
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:55,029
You're going to show everybody what you're capable of. Not what anybody else is,

91
00:12:55,029 --> 00:13:00,230
what you are. You have what it takes. You're in that. Now click play to watch what you did.

92
00:13:19,269 --> 00:13:21,830
Now you're ready for something a little more intense.

93
00:13:22,389 --> 00:13:25,590
That's too quiet. I'll turn it up. I'll turn it up.

94
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:48,659
Looks like this show could use a remix. Click remix to start remixing. I'm the alien.

95
00:13:50,419 --> 00:13:55,460
Now point at the alien and pull the trigger to hop in. All you got to do is react to the

96
00:13:55,460 --> 00:14:00,340
other character. Don't forget to use your body and your voice. When you're ready, click record.

97
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:03,940
All right. So I got to get a good scene here. All right. I think I'm ready.

98
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:13,110
Hey, hey, hey. You buying my girl a drink at the bar?

99
00:14:17,029 --> 00:14:21,669
Don't you ever look at my girl again. That was quite a performance.

100
00:14:21,669 --> 00:14:27,580
Let's watch back your remix. Where is the bar? There is no bar here.

101
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:35,370
Great. You just did your first remix. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. I want to

102
00:14:41,779 --> 00:14:46,899
let's talk about this. Not sure about sharing. You can always hop back in and redo your

103
00:14:46,899 --> 00:14:57,059
record. I want to play it again. Let's talk about this.

104
00:15:02,179 --> 00:15:08,820
It's terrible. Why didn't it pick up the thing I said? Share to stream?

105
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:25,639
Click here to share. I don't want to share that. Who's that on the screen? What does that mean?

106
00:15:26,679 --> 00:15:32,919
Congratulations. You just shared your first remix. Now let's check out what some other folks did

107
00:15:32,919 --> 00:15:46,090
with the same show. What's with my voice?

108
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:51,659
This hot new religion. Come on. Come on. Why is my voice so fucked up?

109
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:54,940
It doesn't even understand why am I.

110
00:15:59,769 --> 00:16:00,330
How do I do that?

111
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:10,090
Oh, there is a giant. If you like a show, hit the heart button on your hand.

112
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:12,570
That'll send some love to the person that created it.

113
00:16:14,919 --> 00:16:20,039
Daniel's remix called to follow. Well, I don't want to follow anybody.

114
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:26,679
Oh, that was wild. Personally, I liked yours the best. When this show ends, you're taking

115
00:16:26,679 --> 00:16:31,559
to the home space. Try following a few folks by pointing at their picture and holding down

116
00:16:31,559 --> 00:16:37,240
the trigger. After that, click on the games tab and play a game. All right. I'm ready to

117
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:47,259
make a show. Star Wars episode seven. I mean, nine. Why am I screaming? I feel like,

118
00:16:47,259 --> 00:16:52,379
okay, this is weird. I feel like when I'm inside the helmet, I have to be louder.

119
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:59,769
I don't understand why that is. All right. What am I doing? Games, play stream, stream

120
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:11,849
games, holiday party, part one. You can't like you contribute to these holiday party.

121
00:17:11,849 --> 00:17:22,920
Which one do you want to contribute to? Get in part three. All right. Let's contribute

122
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:36,059
to this one. This is a holiday party. Just play along with the scene. Don't

123
00:17:36,059 --> 00:17:48,490
forget to use your voice. Here we go. What? Hey, what's happening? What? The party's

124
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:55,750
canceled? Unbelievable. That's stupid. We pay $40 to cover. I don't know how to get back.

125
00:17:56,309 --> 00:18:08,779
Then we have to go through the portal. You want me to hit him? I'll hit him. I'll punch

126
00:18:08,779 --> 00:18:16,009
him in the face as hard as I can. Let's go. Ready? Share your show. I don't want

127
00:18:16,009 --> 00:18:27,029
to share that. That sucked. That's my voice. It's canceled. That's stupid. Yeah. Sorry

128
00:18:27,029 --> 00:18:35,769
about that. I don't know. You know how to get back? Yeah. Problem. That portal's

129
00:18:35,769 --> 00:18:39,849
only a one way portal. You're kidding. These blocks can help you. You want to

130
00:18:39,849 --> 00:18:44,710
try that? You want me to hit him? I'll hit him. I'll punch him in the face as

131
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:52,549
hard as I can. Let's go. Okay. I didn't think my voice. How do I make my voice

132
00:18:52,549 --> 00:18:59,240
different? I'm not sharing that one. Fine. I will. That was just me talking as

133
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:11,539
me. All right. Get me back here. All right. What about Hungry for Veggies?

134
00:19:11,539 --> 00:19:16,019
I'm just like, I'm ruined. Okay. I'm just ruining other people's shows. Is

135
00:19:16,019 --> 00:19:19,539
that what this is? Hungry for Veggies. Do I have to pretend to be like

136
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:34,089
Hungry for Veggies. Part one? Why are these clocks on? Oh, okay. I see. It's

137
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:41,420
downloading. We'll do part one. I need to change my voice too. Otherwise, it's

138
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:47,180
just like Jerma985, the fucking loser. It's my voice. It's just me. No,

139
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:53,240
I'm going to be like monsters and shit. All right. Here we go.

140
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:57,880
Just play along with the scene. Don't forget to use your voice. Here we

141
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:06,980
go. Grandpa. What are you going to do during the holidays? I'm going to

142
00:20:07,059 --> 00:20:15,430
visit you and hug you. That's what we do here today. You and me. That's

143
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:19,509
interesting. I'm just going to chill out here in the fridge. Do you have any

144
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:25,269
cookies? You guys, they're planning on eating us. What? Oh no, what am I

145
00:20:25,269 --> 00:20:38,759
going to do? Now share your show. I'm sorry. I was so...

146
00:20:38,759 --> 00:20:40,759
I was so...

147
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:45,400
Italics! Italics, don't worry. Don't call the police. I'm fine.

148
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:55,019
I'm going to visit you and hug you. That's what we do here today.

149
00:20:55,660 --> 00:21:02,200
You and me. That's so awkward. That's interesting. I'm just going to

150
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:07,400
chill out here in the fridge. Do you have any cookies? You guys, they're

151
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:24,700
planning on eating us. What? Oh no, what am I going to do? Why would

152
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:28,920
you stop screaming there? You know what I mean? Can we show that

153
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:34,230
again? How do I move the camera? What are you going to do during the

154
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:38,069
holidays? I'm going to visit you and hug you. That's what we do here

155
00:21:38,069 --> 00:21:46,039
today. You and me. Is this a ninja turtle? I'm just going to chill

156
00:21:46,039 --> 00:21:50,839
out here in the fridge. Do you have any cookies? You guys, they're

157
00:21:50,839 --> 00:22:03,420
planning on eating us. What? Oh no, what am I going to do? Hey,

158
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:08,470
welcome to the scream stream. How do I do that? I don't know,

159
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:16,309
I'll go back. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Export video. 360. No, share.

160
00:22:17,849 --> 00:22:28,410
Yeah, there we go. I don't know how. Love it. That was great.

161
00:22:29,210 --> 00:22:32,569
Unless I can press a button, maybe? All right, we'll get in a

162
00:22:32,569 --> 00:22:40,150
couple more. Let me go fuck up somebody else's mind show. I

163
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:46,339
had to do it, right? I had to do it. You can import source

164
00:22:46,339 --> 00:22:50,089
filmmaker characters in this game? How loud was that? Did I

165
00:22:50,089 --> 00:22:59,450
really peak the mic that much? How bad was that peak? There we

166
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:07,579
go. Well, there's the new phone. How do we get in to get

167
00:23:07,579 --> 00:23:18,710
it? How do you think Santa's going to feel about that?

168
00:23:27,289 --> 00:23:30,170
Sounds good to me. Let's go get that phone. How do I do

169
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:34,410
this? I want to remix this. Remix.

170
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:46,900
Need to get phone in case. Not big surprise. I can do it.

171
00:23:46,900 --> 00:24:12,869
Let's go. Wait. Well, there's the new phone. How do we get

172
00:24:12,869 --> 00:24:16,950
in to get it? No, I just put a bit. How do I be the heavy?

173
00:24:19,109 --> 00:24:29,670
No, no, no. Record tools. Here. No, no, no, no. Go back.

174
00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:33,750
Reset, reset. What's going on here? Google Play? I just

175
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:52,339
implanted him into the scene. How do I play? Did I do something

176
00:24:52,339 --> 00:25:02,339
wrong here? Right hand. Okay, that's move. Is there like a...

177
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:12,089
Okay, there we go. Hop in, right? Hop in. Is this like

178
00:25:12,089 --> 00:25:40,950
protected? Hop in. Delete. Okay. Hop in. Trigger. Yeah,

179
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:43,910
I'm pressing the trigger. Maybe this, maybe I can't like

180
00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:48,250
fuck with this one. Let's go back. No, no, don't you?

181
00:25:55,269 --> 00:26:08,410
Okay, there we go. Remix. So hop in. That was weird. Okay.

182
00:26:09,779 --> 00:26:13,430
No, no, no, no. All right. Well, shit. Okay, I want to be

183
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:15,670
the heavy. I'll just do them both. I'm just going to do

184
00:26:15,670 --> 00:26:17,750
them both. I'll show you my acting skills. Ready? That

185
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:29,500
looks good. You can do like sad. There we go. Hey, hey,

186
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:33,099
hey. Do re mi, do re mi, do re mi, do re mi, do re mi. Okay,

187
00:26:33,099 --> 00:26:41,190
I'm ready. There's the cell phone that you were looking

188
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:41,750
for.

189
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:44,150
You fucking break in, you fucking idiot. How else do we

190
00:26:44,150 --> 00:26:46,950
fucking get in there, huh? Actually, if you have a brick

191
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:49,589
or something, we could throw the brick through the window

192
00:26:49,589 --> 00:26:56,339
and steal the phone. That's my hand. You're swearing way

193
00:26:56,339 --> 00:26:58,900
too much. I did not raise you like this. I did not raise

194
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:00,980
you like this. You swear too much. Your mother says the

195
00:27:01,059 --> 00:27:06,650
same thing. You're going to go to jail one day.

196
00:27:06,650 --> 00:27:14,299
There's the cell phone that you were looking for.

197
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:17,099
You fucking break in, you fucking idiot. How else do we

198
00:27:17,099 --> 00:27:20,140
fucking get in there, huh? Actually, if you have a brick

199
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:22,779
or something, we could throw the brick through the window

200
00:27:22,779 --> 00:27:25,819
and steal the phone. That's my hand. I think I fucking

201
00:27:25,819 --> 00:27:27,980
kissed the new fucking phone. You see that shit over there,

202
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:30,619
man? That's my fucking new iPhone 25. I did not raise

203
00:27:30,619 --> 00:27:32,619
you like this. I did not raise you like this. You

204
00:27:32,619 --> 00:27:34,779
swear too much. Your mother says the same thing.

205
00:27:34,779 --> 00:27:39,349
Fuck yeah, do as fucking do it. You're going to go to jail

206
00:27:39,349 --> 00:27:48,309
one day. Let's just remix this fucking one, too.

207
00:27:48,309 --> 00:27:57,960
We got that one.

208
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:06,650
There's the cell phone that you were looking for.

209
00:28:06,650 --> 00:28:10,170
Yes, cell phone in there. Heavy wants cell phone

210
00:28:10,170 --> 00:28:13,130
to use. Yeah, actually, if you have a brick or something, we could throw the

211
00:28:13,769 --> 00:28:19,369
brick through the window. That's good idea. Let me try. I will break

212
00:28:19,369 --> 00:28:22,890
door down. You're swearing way too much. I did not raise you like this.

213
00:28:22,890 --> 00:28:27,130
Swear. I did not raise you like this. You swear too much. When did I swear?

214
00:28:27,130 --> 00:28:32,250
I will crush puny man with fingers and squeeze. I'm kind of doing

215
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:35,130
Reinhardt right now at the beginning. All right, whatever.

216
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:40,259
There's the cell phone that you were looking for.

217
00:28:40,259 --> 00:28:44,019
Yes, cell phone in there. Heavy wants cell phone to use.

218
00:28:44,099 --> 00:28:47,619
Actually, if you have a brick or something, we could throw the brick through the window.

219
00:28:49,779 --> 00:28:54,740
That's good idea. Let me try. I will break door down. You're swearing way

220
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:56,579
too much. I did not raise you like this.

221
00:28:56,579 --> 00:28:59,700
Swear. I did not raise you like this. You swear too much. When did I swear?

222
00:29:00,819 --> 00:29:04,819
I will crush puny man with fingers and squeeze. You're going to go to jail one day.

223
00:29:06,819 --> 00:29:08,019
What the fuck was that?

224
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:17,799
No, no, no, I don't want to be a scream stream.

225
00:29:20,019 --> 00:29:24,980
God damn it. I'm sorry for everybody. Just lower the volume a little.

226
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:42,839
There's the cell phone that you were looking for.

227
00:29:42,839 --> 00:29:46,599
Yes, cell phone in there. Heavy wants cell phone to use.

228
00:29:46,599 --> 00:29:50,279
Actually, if you have a brick or something, we could throw the brick through the window.

229
00:29:50,839 --> 00:29:56,119
Squeeze. That's good idea. Let me try. I will break door down.

230
00:29:56,119 --> 00:29:59,240
You're swearing way too much. I did not raise you like this.

231
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,359
Swear. I did not raise you like this.

232
00:30:00,359 --> 00:30:02,359
You swear too much. When did I swear?

233
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:11,259
I will crush puny man with fingers and squeeze.

234
00:30:11,259 --> 00:30:12,779
I told you to be ready for it. I'm sorry.

235
00:30:15,529 --> 00:30:18,890
There's the cell phone that you were looking for.

236
00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:22,650
Yes, cell phone in there. Heavy wants cell phone to use.

237
00:30:22,650 --> 00:30:26,170
Actually, if you have a brick or something, we could throw the brick through the window.

238
00:30:28,329 --> 00:30:32,009
That's good idea. Let me try. I will break door down.

239
00:30:32,009 --> 00:30:35,130
You're swearing way too much. I did not raise you like this.

240
00:30:35,130 --> 00:30:36,250
Swear. I did not raise you like this.

241
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:38,250
You swear too much. When did I swear?

242
00:30:39,369 --> 00:30:43,210
I will crush puny man with fingers and squeeze.

243
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:50,380
This is fucking terrible. Can I delete this character forever?

244
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:54,140
I'm not going to do that. You're going to blow my vocal cords out

245
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:55,900
if I have to put him in every single scene.

246
00:30:59,029 --> 00:31:01,990
He just has my voice. He doesn't even have a cool voice.

247
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:14,230
By the way, I'm just coming to a realization here.

248
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:18,789
This is part two of somebody's story that they made.

249
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:22,789
I just came in the middle. This person is making a cake.

250
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:28,309
The cake has got eggs, it's got baking soda, it's got vanilla extract.

251
00:31:28,309 --> 00:31:30,549
I just walked in. They went to the bathroom.

252
00:31:31,269 --> 00:31:34,309
And I came in here and I just dumped in a bunch of gravy

253
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:36,150
and just fucking shook it up and left the house.

254
00:31:37,670 --> 00:31:40,309
That's seriously what I did. Okay.

255
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:43,430
I don't think I can add any more people.

256
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:47,029
Let's watch it one more time and then we'll move on.

257
00:31:47,029 --> 00:31:50,630
There's a cell phone that you were looking for.

258
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:56,140
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Remix. Remix. Get me in here.

259
00:31:56,779 --> 00:31:58,059
Get me in here. We're redoing this one.

260
00:31:58,619 --> 00:32:07,109
There's a cell phone that you were looking for.

261
00:32:07,109 --> 00:32:10,710
Yes, cell phone in there. Heavy, what cell phone?

262
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:14,869
I didn't break it.

263
00:32:14,869 --> 00:32:20,710
That's a good idea. Let me try. I will break the door down.

264
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:23,670
You're saying too much right now. I didn't raise you like this.

265
00:32:23,670 --> 00:32:26,950
I did not raise you like this. Your mother says this too.

266
00:32:27,930 --> 00:32:30,569
I will crush puny man with fingers.

267
00:32:31,849 --> 00:32:32,410
I'm kind of...

268
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:39,319
There is a cell phone that you were looking for.

269
00:32:39,319 --> 00:32:42,759
Yes, cell phone in there. Heavy, what cell phone?

270
00:32:42,759 --> 00:32:51,079
I didn't break it.

271
00:32:51,079 --> 00:32:55,720
I didn't raise you like this.

272
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:58,279
I didn't raise you like this.

273
00:32:58,279 --> 00:32:59,240
Your mother says this too.

274
00:33:00,039 --> 00:33:02,680
I will crush puny man with fingers.

275
00:33:03,559 --> 00:33:14,170
I'm fucking out of here. I'm out of here. I'm out of this. I'm done. That was bad.

276
00:33:16,170 --> 00:33:25,700
What happened to mine? Oh, I went back.

277
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:42,980
Why is it always a little kid? It's always a kid. Why is the biggest guy always the little kid?

278
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:47,980
You break the window.

279
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:49,980
Alright, I'm getting the fuck out of here.

280
00:33:54,930 --> 00:34:02,509
What else is there? I love this. Let's do, uh, Big Barb's Bee Farm.

281
00:34:02,509 --> 00:34:25,920
Hamsgiving. Space Trek. Space Trek. Part 3. Let's get in this one. Watch this.

282
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:31,920
Make them all screaming lettuce. Guys, you want this stream to be like 45 minutes long?

283
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:39,920
Is that what you want? Because the more that I scream as loud as I can, the more it's going to be over in like less than two hours.

284
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:49,239
Alright, here we go. I gotta go in for this one. Who should I be? Let's find out.

285
00:34:51,989 --> 00:35:01,489
I could have gone a little bit better. The alien was pretty hostile, I gotta admit. But, you know, at least we're here in this great desert.

286
00:35:01,489 --> 00:35:05,489
There are literally no life signs on the entire planet in case you were wondering.

287
00:35:05,489 --> 00:35:06,489
Oh, that's good.

288
00:35:06,489 --> 00:35:10,489
Well, I wasn't wondering, but thanks for letting me know. Good to know.

289
00:35:10,489 --> 00:35:13,489
Well, at least there's no one left to write us a bad report, right?

290
00:35:13,489 --> 00:35:16,489
Well, I hope we can find our way back to the ship.

291
00:35:18,489 --> 00:35:19,489
Watch this one.

292
00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:49,719
Come on. I can't be like the tourist. I can't move you? Oh, it's protected. Come on.

293
00:35:49,719 --> 00:35:58,219
How is this like protected? I was gonna put them all the way back there and be sprinting down screaming about how there's no oxygen on the planet.

294
00:35:58,219 --> 00:36:16,630
Oh, come on. Yeah, I'm hoping it. Can I? How do I teleport? Can I teleport?

295
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:42,190
Here we go. Teleport. No, no, no, no. That looks good.

296
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:52,539
Am I gonna bump into anything? Where am I? I don't know. I'm gonna smash into something. I'm not careful.

297
00:36:52,539 --> 00:37:19,570
Thank God. This light. Hey, it's quicksand. Shit. Hey, why do you not have astronaut helmets on?

298
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:27,559
There's no oxygen on the planet. No. No. No, I told you.

299
00:37:28,559 --> 00:37:29,559
Okay, I'm back. Quicksand.

300
00:37:29,559 --> 00:37:32,559
There's no one left to write us a bad report, right?

301
00:37:32,559 --> 00:37:35,559
Try it. I'll come over there and I'll give you the oxygen pills.

302
00:37:36,559 --> 00:37:49,500
Why is this one different? Where's the camera? Wait, what? No, give me over here.

303
00:37:57,809 --> 00:38:00,809
So, how did it go?

304
00:38:02,619 --> 00:38:04,619
It's quicksand. Shit.

305
00:38:04,619 --> 00:38:05,619
It didn't go very good.

306
00:38:06,619 --> 00:38:07,619
It didn't like me.

307
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:15,000
Why do you not have astronaut helmets on? There's no oxygen on the planet. No, I told you.

308
00:38:19,099 --> 00:38:22,099
Well, at least there's no one left to write us a bad report, right?

309
00:38:23,099 --> 00:38:26,099
Try it. I'll come over there and I'll give you the oxygen pills.

310
00:38:27,099 --> 00:38:46,409
What a fucking mess. How do I move the character? Put to boomer in.

311
00:38:46,409 --> 00:38:56,380
Hold on. I'm going to delete this character. Hold on.

312
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:02,260
All right, now we got our own scene.

313
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:23,429
Go right here. What are we going to do about that? Characters.

314
00:39:24,429 --> 00:39:25,670
What about voices and shit?

315
00:39:32,099 --> 00:39:34,099
Is there a way we can change that?

316
00:39:34,099 --> 00:39:37,590
Let's hold on. Looks good. No, no, no. This is like more... There we go.

317
00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:39,590
That's better. Okay.

318
00:39:47,079 --> 00:39:48,079
Three o'clock.

319
00:39:49,079 --> 00:39:54,010
Do you know this guy?

320
00:39:56,380 --> 00:39:57,380
You all right?

321
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:59,380
Why do you not have astronaut helmets on?

322
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:01,380
Because we can breathe.

323
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:02,380
There's no oxygen on the planet.

324
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:06,380
You're stupid.

325
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:07,380
No, I told you.

326
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:09,380
Do you know this guy?

327
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:10,869
Quicksand.

328
00:40:11,869 --> 00:40:12,869
We can move around fine, man.

329
00:40:13,869 --> 00:40:15,869
I'll come over there and I'll give you the oxygen pills.

330
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:21,380
You're stupid.

331
00:40:28,099 --> 00:40:29,099
How do I change the voice?

332
00:40:30,099 --> 00:40:32,420
Jesus.

333
00:40:34,179 --> 00:40:35,179
Is there a way to change the voice?

334
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:45,460
Auto changes. Okay.

335
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:47,460
Oh, hey, Keywell.

336
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:48,460
Here we go. Ready?

337
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:52,719
I got to get this right because we have to both like suck in the air at the same time.

338
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:57,260
What do you got for a time?

339
00:40:57,260 --> 00:40:58,260
Three o'clock.

340
00:40:58,260 --> 00:40:59,260
Thank God it's light.

341
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:02,900
Hey, it's Quicksand.

342
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:03,900
Do you know this guy?

343
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:04,900
Shit.

344
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:05,900
I don't know who that is.

345
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:06,900
Hey, you all right?

346
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:08,900
Why do you not have astronaut helmets on?

347
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:10,900
Because we can breathe.

348
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:11,900
There's no oxygen on the planet.

349
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:15,900
You're stupid.

350
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:16,900
No, I told you.

351
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:17,900
You are an idiot.

352
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:18,900
Do you know this guy?

353
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:19,900
I don't know that.

354
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:20,900
Why do you keep asking me that?

355
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:22,900
I got a rope.

356
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:23,900
Hold on.

357
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:25,900
Little finger.

358
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:26,900
That's a rope.

359
00:41:32,679 --> 00:41:33,679
Oh, shit.

360
00:41:40,739 --> 00:41:41,739
I got too into it.

361
00:41:41,739 --> 00:41:42,739
I got too into the fucking scene.

362
00:41:43,739 --> 00:41:45,110
Hold on.

363
00:41:45,110 --> 00:41:52,179
Go back.

364
00:41:52,179 --> 00:41:54,179
I wanted to see it so bad from this angle.

365
00:42:00,539 --> 00:42:01,539
I got to learn how to do like cameras.

366
00:42:01,539 --> 00:42:02,539
Like I think it's like this, right?

367
00:42:03,539 --> 00:42:07,019
So we can start here.

368
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:13,260
Thank God it's light.

369
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:20,739
Hey, it's Quicksand.

370
00:42:20,739 --> 00:42:21,739
Do you know this guy?

371
00:42:21,739 --> 00:42:22,739
Shit.

372
00:42:22,739 --> 00:42:25,579
I don't know who that is.

373
00:42:25,579 --> 00:42:26,579
I can move in like here.

374
00:42:28,199 --> 00:42:30,199
Hey, you all right?

375
00:42:30,199 --> 00:42:32,500
Why do you not have astronaut helmets on?

376
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:34,500
Because we can breathe.

377
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:35,500
There's no oxygen on the planet.

378
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:39,500
I hate that.

379
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:40,500
I hate it so much.

380
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:41,500
You're stupid.

381
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:42,500
No, I told you.

382
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:43,500
You are an idiot.

383
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:44,500
Do you know this guy?

384
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:45,500
Quicksand.

385
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:46,500
I don't know that.

386
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:47,500
Why do you keep asking me that?

387
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:48,500
I got a rope.

388
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:49,500
I got a rope.

389
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:52,090
I got a rope.

390
00:42:52,090 --> 00:42:53,090
I'll give you the oxygen by the finger.

391
00:42:54,090 --> 00:42:56,929
Hold on.

392
00:43:02,650 --> 00:43:03,650
Okay.

393
00:43:03,650 --> 00:43:05,650
My hands are like too shaky to do this.

394
00:43:05,650 --> 00:43:06,650
God damn it.

395
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:07,650
Hold on.

396
00:43:07,650 --> 00:43:09,650
My hands are like fucking shaky as hell.

397
00:43:13,619 --> 00:43:14,619
Thank God it's light.

398
00:43:15,619 --> 00:43:16,980
All right.

399
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:17,980
Hold on a second.

400
00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:18,980
Let me put this down.

401
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:20,349
Where is it?

402
00:43:20,349 --> 00:43:21,349
I'm down on the ground.

403
00:43:21,349 --> 00:43:22,780
All right.

404
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:25,780
Let's sit here and watch it while I have like shaky sniper hands.

405
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:28,780
Thank God it's light.

406
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:33,329
It's Quicksand.

407
00:43:33,329 --> 00:43:34,570
Do you know this guy?

408
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:38,050
I don't ever get it.

409
00:43:38,050 --> 00:43:39,420
Why do you not have astralisks on?

410
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:41,420
Because we can breathe.

411
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:42,420
There's no oxygen on the planet.

412
00:43:45,590 --> 00:43:47,219
No.

413
00:43:47,219 --> 00:43:48,219
I told you.

414
00:43:48,219 --> 00:43:49,219
You are an idiot.

415
00:43:49,219 --> 00:43:50,219
Do you know this guy?

416
00:43:50,219 --> 00:43:51,219
Quicksand.

417
00:43:51,219 --> 00:43:52,219
I don't know that.

418
00:43:52,219 --> 00:43:53,219
Why do you keep asking me that?

419
00:43:53,219 --> 00:43:54,219
I got a rope.

420
00:43:54,219 --> 00:43:55,219
We can move out of the highland.

421
00:43:55,219 --> 00:44:07,760
I'll get over there and I'll give you the oxygen by the finger.

422
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:08,760
What do I have?

423
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:09,760
Save performance.

424
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:10,760
Okay.

425
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:12,579
How do I do that?

426
00:44:12,579 --> 00:44:13,579
Now get this off.

427
00:44:13,579 --> 00:44:17,380
Quick share.

428
00:44:17,380 --> 00:44:19,699
Share.

429
00:44:19,699 --> 00:44:20,699
Share.

430
00:44:20,699 --> 00:44:22,010
There we go.

431
00:44:22,010 --> 00:44:24,019
There you go.

432
00:44:24,019 --> 00:44:28,900
There it is.

433
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:29,900
Somebody filmed a wedding?

434
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:30,900
What the fuck?

435
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:32,139
So this is...

436
00:44:32,139 --> 00:44:34,150
Wait.

437
00:44:34,150 --> 00:44:35,150
Wow.

438
00:44:35,150 --> 00:44:36,150
So how did it go?

439
00:44:36,150 --> 00:44:37,150
This is...

440
00:44:37,150 --> 00:44:38,150
No, it is another one.

441
00:44:38,150 --> 00:44:42,719
Where's mine?

442
00:44:42,719 --> 00:44:43,719
I want to see mine pop up in here.

443
00:44:43,719 --> 00:44:44,719
Wow.

444
00:44:44,719 --> 00:44:46,150
So how did it go?

445
00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:47,150
I didn't even use the right characters.

446
00:44:47,150 --> 00:44:48,150
Yeah.

447
00:44:48,150 --> 00:44:49,519
There are literal life signs on the entire planet in case you were wondering.

448
00:44:49,619 --> 00:44:51,739
What's wrong...

449
00:44:51,739 --> 00:45:15,679
At least there's no one left to write us a bad report, right?

450
00:45:15,679 --> 00:45:16,679
Sorry.

451
00:45:16,679 --> 00:45:21,900
What the fuck?

452
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:27,280
Recreate the clip frame, we've got plenty of things to do here.

453
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:30,550
I'm going to do a full scene in the gym.

454
00:45:30,550 --> 00:45:36,489
scene. And then I'm gonna do the Clippet scene. We've got a long way to go. I might even go get

455
00:45:36,489 --> 00:45:49,119
fucking wine. This is amazing. What a fun game. I can't wait. All right. One more of these. What

456
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:59,920
about games? What did I do? Oh, okay. I was on games. All right. Hold on. One more. Let me

457
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:21,590
just go and see one more. Secret agent. That's so cool. Let's do secret agent. So you want to

458
00:46:21,590 --> 00:46:47,659
be a secret agent. Start by telling me the worst thing you have ever done. So you want to be a

459
00:46:47,659 --> 00:46:56,820
secret agent. Start by telling me the worst thing you have ever done. I've shit in my hand and I

460
00:46:56,820 --> 00:47:01,579
ate it only one time though, but that was weird. It was, I was hungry and there was no more pizzas

461
00:47:01,579 --> 00:47:07,599
in the fridge in the freezer. Is that enough? I don't have any combat training at all. Zero.

462
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:17,920
And I'm very afraid of knives and it's pointy shark things. So it is indeed terrible. So

463
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:28,179
you want to be a secret agent. Start by telling me the worst thing you have ever done. I've shit

464
00:47:28,179 --> 00:47:31,980
in my hand and I ate it only one time though, but that was weird. It was, I was hungry.

465
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:38,000
There was no more pizzas in the fridge in the freezer. Is that enough? I don't have any

466
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:43,280
combat training at all. Zero. And I'm very afraid of knives and it's pointy shark things.

467
00:47:43,280 --> 00:48:03,710
It is indeed terrible. So you want to be a secret agent. Start by telling me the worst thing

468
00:48:03,710 --> 00:48:08,230
you have ever done. Let me think about this. Five seconds from now, snap your neck,

469
00:48:08,230 --> 00:48:12,150
throw you over the table, bend your legs backwards over your head, crack all the

470
00:48:12,150 --> 00:48:15,429
bones in your body and snap them in every direction. Is that enough for you? Oh yeah,

471
00:48:15,429 --> 00:48:25,420
by the way, look at me. What? No. So you want to be a secret agent. Start by telling me the worst

472
00:48:25,420 --> 00:48:30,619
thing you have ever done. Let me think about this. Five seconds from now, snap your neck,

473
00:48:30,619 --> 00:48:35,099
throw you over the table, bend your legs backwards over your head, crack all the bones in your body

474
00:48:35,099 --> 00:48:38,900
and snap them in every direction. Is that enough for you? Oh yeah, by the way, look at me.

475
00:48:38,900 --> 00:48:51,039
What the fuck? Why did I say that at the end? It is indeed terrible. Why? I like fruits. By the way,

476
00:48:51,039 --> 00:49:01,130
look at me. Oh, by the way, look at me. No, get back in there. Get back in there. I'm going to

477
00:49:01,130 --> 00:49:17,730
do a different version of that one. So you want to be a secret agent. Start by telling me

478
00:49:17,730 --> 00:49:26,130
the worst thing you have ever done. Worst thing I've ever done? First of all, that laptop right

479
00:49:26,130 --> 00:49:30,849
there, smash it down onto your fingers just like the old pie cartoon thing where the person puts

480
00:49:30,849 --> 00:49:34,369
their hands on it and the grandma comes over and slams the pie down on their hands and then

481
00:49:34,369 --> 00:49:38,969
break your face in half, take both your eyeballs out, eat them both at the same time and then

482
00:49:38,969 --> 00:49:45,210
you, I would make you watch and then boot you in the face as hard as I could. So you want to

Let me get the camera.

520
00:52:57,699 --> 00:52:59,699
Let me get the camera.

521
00:52:59,699 --> 00:53:14,719
I need to move.

522
00:53:14,719 --> 00:53:17,719
This is a Food Network Star Season 41 audition.

523
00:53:17,719 --> 00:53:19,719

First of all, that laptop right there.

527
00:53:42,219 --> 00:53:46,800
Smash it down on your fingers.

528
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:48,800
Just like the old pie cartoon thing.

529
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:52,800
First they put their hands on it, then the grandma comes over and slams it.

530
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:56,389
The pie down on their hands.

531
00:53:56,389 --> 00:53:58,389
And then break your face in half.

532
00:53:58,389 --> 00:54:00,389
Take both your eyeballs out.

533
00:54:00,389 --> 00:54:10,880
Eat them both at the same time.

534
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:12,880
And then you...

535
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:14,880
What does that have to do with pasta?

536
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:16,880
Let's watch it.

537
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:23,110
This is a Food Network Star Season 41 audition.

538
00:54:23,110 --> 00:54:25,110
No, goddamn it, stop.

539
00:54:25,110 --> 00:54:33,550
This is a Food Network Star Season 41 audition.

540
00:54:33,550 --> 00:54:35,550
That's what I'm doing here.

541
00:54:35,550 --> 00:54:37,550
What makes you a Food Network Star?

542
00:54:37,550 --> 00:54:39,550
Worst thing I've ever done.

543
00:54:39,550 --> 00:54:42,550
First of all, that laptop right there.

544
00:54:42,550 --> 00:54:44,550
Smash it down on your fingers.

545
00:54:44,550 --> 00:54:46,550

Eat them both at the same time.

550
00:54:54,550 --> 00:54:55,550
And then you...

551
00:54:55,550 --> 00:54:57,550
What does that have to do with pasta?

552
00:54:57,550 --> 00:54:59,550
Let's watch it.

553
00:54:59,550 --> 00:55:10,300
The camera man.

554
00:55:10,300 --> 00:55:12,300
Yeah, I'm just realizing that.

555
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:14,300
Why is the camera man in focus?

556
00:55:14,300 --> 00:55:16,300
It should be from that perspective.

557
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:23,440
It's time to make our room, okay?

558
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:28,139
Let's share this one.

559
00:55:28,139 --> 00:55:36,079
Sure, why not?

560
00:55:36,079 --> 00:55:39,469
What's...

561
00:55:39,469 --> 00:55:40,469
Oh, there we go, okay.

562
00:55:40,469 --> 00:55:42,989
Is there another one?

563
00:55:42,989 --> 00:55:45,989
So you want to be a secret agent?

564
00:55:45,989 --> 00:55:48,159
Stop.

565
00:55:48,159 --> 00:55:49,849
Alright.

566
00:55:49,849 --> 00:55:55,650
So, my create a show.

567
00:55:55,650 --> 00:55:58,340
Let's see how this works.

568
00:55:58,340 --> 00:56:00,340
Okay, untitled by Tommy Pickles.

569
00:56:00,340 --> 00:56:02,340
We got hip.

570
00:56:02,340 --> 00:56:04,340
Space, a diner?

571
00:56:04,340 --> 00:56:05,340
Okay.

572
00:56:05,340 --> 00:56:15,630
Is there a gym?

573
00:56:17,630 --> 00:56:21,519
Here we go.

574
00:56:21,519 --> 00:56:25,230
Alright, opening scene.

575
00:56:25,230 --> 00:56:26,230
Environment.

576
00:56:26,230 --> 00:56:27,659
Characters.

577
00:56:27,659 --> 00:56:33,480
Okay, let's go with...

578
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:44,239
Let's start with you.

579
00:56:44,239 --> 00:56:45,239
Where's my other options?

580
00:56:45,239 --> 00:56:46,239
Why are they locked?

581
00:56:46,239 --> 00:56:54,219
I can't move them?

582
00:56:54,219 --> 00:56:56,219
Do I not have access to this?

583
00:56:56,219 --> 00:56:57,909
For some reason?

584
00:56:57,909 --> 00:56:58,909
Why is it locked?

585
00:56:58,909 --> 00:57:11,389
It's DLC!

586
00:57:11,389 --> 00:57:16,380
It might be in record mode.

587
00:57:16,380 --> 00:57:26,670
How do I get that off?

588
00:57:26,670 --> 00:57:28,670
No, it's not DLC.

589
00:57:28,670 --> 00:57:34,599
Weirdly enough, it thinks I'm still trying to videotape.

590
00:57:34,599 --> 00:57:39,329
I wonder if I can just put somebody else in here.

591
00:57:39,329 --> 00:57:41,329
I'm still doing the same thing.

592
00:57:41,329 --> 00:57:45,559
Nothing like over here.

593
00:57:45,559 --> 00:57:49,460
It's just glitched out in record...

594
00:57:49,460 --> 00:57:51,460
Alright, let me go back to the main menu.

595
00:57:51,460 --> 00:57:53,829
Let's try it again.

596
00:57:53,829 --> 00:57:55,829
Create show.

597
00:57:55,829 --> 00:58:03,119
Pretty good.

598
00:58:04,119 --> 00:58:05,559
Huh.

599
00:58:05,559 --> 00:58:07,559
Maybe I should need to restart the game?

600
00:58:07,559 --> 00:58:13,210
Green screen?

601
00:58:13,210 --> 00:58:14,210
Green screen?

602
00:58:14,210 --> 00:58:15,210
Hold on, hold on.

603
00:58:15,210 --> 00:58:23,449
Behind me.

604
00:58:23,449 --> 00:58:26,400
Click one of these sides?

605
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:30,900
Oh, hold on.

606
00:58:30,900 --> 00:58:36,199
Props.

607
00:58:36,199 --> 00:58:41,940
Environment.

608
00:58:43,820 --> 00:58:48,719
So you want to be a secret agent?

609
00:58:48,719 --> 00:58:55,699
Just record it and then edit it.

610
00:58:55,699 --> 00:59:00,050
I guess I'm just recording.

611
00:59:00,050 --> 00:59:01,050
Okay.

612
00:59:01,050 --> 00:59:03,800
No, it's not recording anything.

613
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:12,440
I think I might have to restart the game.

614
00:59:12,440 --> 00:59:15,639
I can't even press this.

615
00:59:18,610 --> 00:59:23,730
Yellow dots?

616
00:59:23,730 --> 00:59:29,579
Clear?

617
00:59:29,579 --> 00:59:33,550
Nah, something's not right here.

618
00:59:33,550 --> 00:59:36,840
Something's not right.

619
00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:37,840
I'm stuck in the void.

620
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:42,639
I'm just going to restart the game.

621
00:59:42,639 --> 00:59:43,639
Yeah, let's just restart it.

622
00:59:43,639 --> 00:59:44,639
Give me a second.

623
00:59:44,639 --> 00:59:49,119
I'm also, you know what?

624
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:51,739
Let's get some wine up here too.

625
00:59:51,739 --> 00:59:56,880
I'm going to make a whole goddamn movie.

626
00:59:56,880 --> 01:00:00,210
Let's get some wine up here.

627
01:00:01,210 --> 01:00:05,559
Let me get out for a second.

628
01:00:05,559 --> 01:00:09,519
I'm going to restart the game.

629
01:00:09,519 --> 01:00:10,519
This is a ton of fun.

630
01:00:10,519 --> 01:00:18,639
I will be right back.

631
01:00:18,639 --> 01:03:41,400
I'm going to get this restarted and grab a glass of wine.

632
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:46,400
It is like 4,000 degrees in this room already.

633
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:48,400
All right, let me get back in here.

634
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:50,400
Let's hope that fixes it because this is...

635
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:53,789
I'm not going to say it yet.

636
01:03:53,789 --> 01:03:55,670
I'm not sure.

637
01:03:55,670 --> 01:03:57,670
But this could be...

638
01:03:57,670 --> 01:04:01,039
This could be like one of the coolest VR games.

639
01:04:01,039 --> 01:04:03,170
Very possible.

640
01:04:03,170 --> 01:04:09,599
Reopen it up.

641
01:04:09,599 --> 01:04:14,139
Mind show.

642
01:04:14,139 --> 01:04:25,150
Okay, let's try it again.

643
01:04:25,150 --> 01:04:26,150
Hey, everybody!

644
01:04:26,150 --> 01:04:30,559
Hey, did you see?

645
01:04:30,559 --> 01:04:42,750
Okay.

646
01:04:42,750 --> 01:04:43,750
Okay.

647
01:04:43,750 --> 01:04:44,750
Welcome to mind show.

648
01:04:44,750 --> 01:04:46,690
I'm drunk.

649
01:04:46,690 --> 01:04:51,389
This is not...

650
01:04:51,389 --> 01:04:52,389
This is like...

651
01:04:52,389 --> 01:04:53,389
That's a heavy pour, all right?

652
01:04:53,389 --> 01:04:54,949
It is.

653
01:04:54,949 --> 01:04:56,949
But I said I'm going to be drinking it for like four hours.

654
01:04:56,949 --> 01:04:58,960
All right, let's go.

655
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:02,179
Get me back in.

656
01:05:02,179 --> 01:05:06,360
Show it again.

657
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:10,099
This also might be skunked.

658
01:05:10,099 --> 01:05:14,219
Because this is the...

659
01:05:14,219 --> 01:05:15,219
Hey, hold on.

660
01:05:15,219 --> 01:05:19,360
For all of you like scientists, if this...

661
01:05:19,360 --> 01:05:28,099
If you leave a bottle of wine out for like six hours after opening it and you put it back in the fridge, are you going to die?

662
01:05:28,099 --> 01:05:34,269
Does that kill you?

663
01:05:34,269 --> 01:05:35,269
Am I going to get tapeworm?

664
01:05:35,269 --> 01:05:36,440
I don't want to get tapeworm.

665
01:05:36,440 --> 01:05:39,159
Am I going to get like...

666
01:05:39,159 --> 01:05:40,159
Am I going to get worms?

667
01:05:40,159 --> 01:05:47,030
All right.

668
01:05:47,030 --> 01:05:49,039
Yuck.

669
01:05:49,039 --> 01:05:50,469
Ew.

670
01:05:50,469 --> 01:05:52,159
All right.

671
01:05:52,159 --> 01:05:53,159
I'm ready to do my comedy routine.

672
01:05:53,159 --> 01:05:56,119
There we go.

673
01:05:56,119 --> 01:05:59,840
It's already dirty in here.

674
01:05:59,840 --> 01:06:00,840
Sweat check.

675
01:06:00,840 --> 01:06:01,840
We're good.

676
01:06:01,840 --> 01:06:06,380
I know you're not supposed to do this, but fuck it.

677
01:06:06,380 --> 01:06:07,679
I have to.

678
01:06:07,679 --> 01:06:08,679
It's too greasy in here.

679
01:06:08,679 --> 01:06:18,690
All right.

680
01:06:18,690 --> 01:06:19,690
Wait.

681
01:06:19,690 --> 01:06:32,130
One more sip of wine.

682
01:06:32,130 --> 01:06:33,130
I thought it taste right.

683
01:06:33,130 --> 01:06:35,840
I thought it taste right.

684
01:06:35,840 --> 01:06:42,929
Tastes like batteries.

685
01:06:42,929 --> 01:06:44,929
That tastes like batteries smell.

686
01:06:44,929 --> 01:06:54,360
Wrong hand.

687
01:06:54,360 --> 01:06:56,949
Okay.

688
01:06:56,949 --> 01:07:02,460
Where's like...

689
01:07:02,460 --> 01:07:03,460
Assistant!

690
01:07:03,460 --> 01:07:12,420
To help me get in here, you need a personal assistant to get in and out of VR.

691
01:07:12,420 --> 01:07:15,420
That's why when they do the demos, it's like three people there holding stuff for you.

692
01:07:15,420 --> 01:07:17,300
All right.

693
01:07:17,300 --> 01:07:19,949
I'm ready.

694
01:07:19,949 --> 01:07:23,300
Fuck.

695
01:07:23,300 --> 01:07:24,300
Wrong hand.

696
01:07:24,300 --> 01:07:25,300
How did I do this?

697
01:07:25,300 --> 01:07:26,300
What?

698
01:07:26,300 --> 01:07:27,300
I just checked it.

699
01:07:27,300 --> 01:07:28,300
Assistant!

700
01:07:28,300 --> 01:07:29,860
Assistant!

701
01:07:29,860 --> 01:07:31,289
Assistant!

702
01:07:31,289 --> 01:07:32,289
That's flat.

703
01:07:32,289 --> 01:07:45,760
I'm better than that.

704
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:46,760
Email notifications.

705
01:07:46,760 --> 01:07:47,760
Get notified.

706
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:48,760
Don't email me.

707
01:07:48,760 --> 01:07:50,699
Followers?

708
01:07:50,699 --> 01:07:51,699
Who am I?

709
01:07:51,699 --> 01:07:52,940
I'm already following people.

710
01:07:52,940 --> 01:07:53,940
Here we go.

711
01:07:53,940 --> 01:07:55,630
Can we...

712
01:07:55,630 --> 01:07:58,849
Why is this different?

713
01:07:58,849 --> 01:07:59,849
Hey!

714
01:07:59,849 --> 01:08:00,849
Look at that.

715
01:08:00,849 --> 01:08:02,159
Why?

716
01:08:02,159 --> 01:08:03,159
Why did this switch?

717
01:08:03,159 --> 01:08:04,159
Whatever.

718
01:08:04,159 --> 01:08:05,650
Comedy club.

719
01:08:05,650 --> 01:08:06,829
Can you guys hear?

720
01:08:06,829 --> 01:08:08,900
Is it muted?

721
01:08:08,900 --> 01:08:10,400
Shouldn't be muted, right?

722
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:11,400
Okay.

723
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:12,400
All right.

724
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:15,239
Let's do it.

725
01:08:15,239 --> 01:08:16,239
So, this scene is going to be...

726
01:08:16,239 --> 01:08:22,850
Let's block it out here, everybody.

727
01:08:22,850 --> 01:08:24,029
Acting 101.

728
01:08:24,029 --> 01:08:25,720
103, actually.

729
01:08:25,720 --> 01:08:26,720
The first thing you need to do is...

730
01:08:27,720 --> 01:08:28,720
I don't like it here.

731
01:08:28,720 --> 01:08:29,720
That's better.

732
01:08:29,720 --> 01:08:30,720
First thing you need to do in acting is get into a character, right?

733
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:32,079
So, we're going to pick a character and we're going to...

734
01:08:32,079 --> 01:08:33,079
I'm going to give you the whole backstory.

735
01:08:33,079 --> 01:08:34,390
New.

736
01:08:34,390 --> 01:08:35,390
Okay, move a little closer.

737
01:08:35,390 --> 01:08:36,390
Wait.

738
01:08:36,390 --> 01:08:41,920
We're going to have a few people in the scene here to laugh at the jokes.

739
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:42,920
Snow person?

740
01:08:42,920 --> 01:08:44,600
I can only have three people.

741
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:45,600
Shit.

742
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:46,840
Oh, I'm sorry.

743
01:08:46,840 --> 01:08:47,840
I'm sorry.

744
01:08:47,840 --> 01:08:48,840
I'm sorry.

745
01:08:48,840 --> 01:08:49,840
I'm sorry.

746
01:08:49,840 --> 01:08:50,840
I'm sorry.

747
01:08:50,840 --> 01:08:55,350
I'm sorry.

748
01:08:55,350 --> 01:09:04,590
I'm sorry.

749
01:09:04,590 --> 01:09:05,590
I'm sorry.

750
01:09:05,590 --> 01:09:10,670
I'm sorry.

751
01:09:10,670 --> 01:09:11,670
I'm sorry.

752
01:09:11,670 --> 01:09:12,670
I'm sorry.

753
01:09:12,670 --> 01:09:13,670
I'm sorry.

754
01:09:13,670 --> 01:09:15,420
I'm sorry.

755
01:09:15,420 --> 01:09:20,819
I'm sorry.

756
01:09:20,819 --> 01:09:22,960
I'm sorry.

757
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:23,960
I'm sorry.

758
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:24,960
Shit.

759
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:25,960
Okay, well that's fine.

760
01:09:25,960 --> 01:09:32,840
How do I drop the mic stand?

761
01:09:32,840 --> 01:09:33,840
The mic is too high.

762
01:09:33,840 --> 01:09:36,210
All right, let's get this blocked out.

763
01:09:36,210 --> 01:09:37,210
Ready?

764
01:09:37,210 --> 01:09:43,279
So, I'm going to get in here and we'll go with happy.

765
01:09:43,279 --> 01:09:48,760
Dude, are my hands actually this shaky?

766
01:09:48,760 --> 01:09:52,239
What happened?

767
01:09:52,239 --> 01:09:54,569
What?

768
01:09:54,569 --> 01:09:56,939
Didn't I switch this?

769
01:09:56,939 --> 01:09:58,939
I'm confused.

770
01:09:58,939 --> 01:09:59,939
Okay.

771
01:09:59,939 --> 01:10:00,939
I don't know.

772
01:10:00,939 --> 01:10:06,119
I switched it like three times.

773
01:10:06,119 --> 01:10:08,119
Okay, I just poisoned somebody's drink.

774
01:10:08,119 --> 01:10:13,119
Sitting across from them and we switched the poisons back and forth enough times where

775
01:10:13,119 --> 01:10:15,119
I poisoned myself.

776
01:10:15,119 --> 01:10:16,560
Whatever.

777
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:24,529
We just did the princess bride.

778
01:10:24,529 --> 01:10:27,180
All right.

779
01:10:27,180 --> 01:10:28,420
Here we go.

780
01:10:28,420 --> 01:10:31,789
Can I grab the mic?

781
01:10:31,789 --> 01:10:32,789
Here we go.

782
01:10:32,789 --> 01:10:35,920
We're going to get some jokes here.

783
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:36,920
Okay.

784
01:10:36,920 --> 01:10:38,100
How's everybody doing?

785
01:10:38,100 --> 01:10:39,100
How's everybody?

786
01:10:39,100 --> 01:10:41,340
How's everybody doing?

787
01:10:41,340 --> 01:10:42,340
All right.

788
01:10:42,340 --> 01:10:43,340
Okay.

789
01:10:43,340 --> 01:10:44,340
Let's go.

790
01:10:44,340 --> 01:10:45,340
Let's get him.

791
01:10:45,340 --> 01:10:46,340
Let's get him.

792
01:10:46,340 --> 01:10:47,340
He's got something down here.

793
01:10:47,340 --> 01:10:48,340
Okay.

794
01:10:48,340 --> 01:10:50,350
Hey, everybody.

795
01:10:50,350 --> 01:10:51,350
How you doing tonight?

796
01:10:51,350 --> 01:10:52,350
How's everybody doing?

797
01:10:52,350 --> 01:10:55,640
Thank you.

798
01:10:55,640 --> 01:10:56,640
Thank you.

799
01:10:56,640 --> 01:11:01,779
Thank you very much.

800
01:11:01,779 --> 01:11:05,840
So, I just...

801
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:07,649
All right.

802
01:11:07,649 --> 01:11:12,670
All right.

803
01:11:12,670 --> 01:11:13,670
All right.

804
01:11:13,670 --> 01:11:14,670
All right.

805
01:11:14,670 --> 01:11:17,640
They didn't have...

806
01:11:17,640 --> 01:11:18,640
I need to be...

807
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:23,199
First of all, have you been to the airport?

808
01:11:23,199 --> 01:11:24,199
Wait.

809
01:11:24,199 --> 01:11:25,199
That's all the time I get.

810
01:11:25,199 --> 01:11:26,199
Thank you.

811
01:11:26,199 --> 01:11:27,199
Thank you.

812
01:11:27,199 --> 01:11:28,199
Thank you very much.

813
01:11:29,640 --> 01:11:30,640
Look at that acting.

814
01:11:30,640 --> 01:11:31,640
All right.

815
01:11:31,640 --> 01:11:32,640
All right.

816
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:33,640
All right.

817
01:11:33,640 --> 01:11:38,600
They didn't have...

818
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:45,210
I need to be...

819
01:11:45,210 --> 01:11:46,210
First of all, have you been to the airport?

820
01:11:46,210 --> 01:11:47,210
Okay.

821
01:11:47,210 --> 01:11:50,310
Here we go.

822
01:11:50,310 --> 01:11:52,380
Thank you.

823
01:11:52,380 --> 01:11:53,380
Thank you.

824
01:11:53,380 --> 01:11:55,520
He can't reach it.

825
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:57,590
He can't reach it.

826
01:11:57,590 --> 01:11:58,590
Everybody in Twitch chat.

827
01:11:58,590 --> 01:11:59,590
Right.

828
01:11:59,590 --> 01:12:00,590
Right.

829
01:12:00,590 --> 01:12:02,600
Hey.

830
01:12:02,600 --> 01:12:03,600
Everybody in Twitch chat.

831
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:04,600
First of all, have you been to the airport?

832
01:12:04,600 --> 01:12:05,600
Wait.

833
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:06,600
That's all the time I get.

834
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:09,119
Thank you.

835
01:12:09,119 --> 01:12:23,159
Thank you very much.

01:47:15,439 --> 01:47:28,000
how do I do that

1179
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:37,199

1180
01:47:37,199 --> 01:47:41,199
yellow dots is saved

1181
01:47:41,199 --> 01:47:45,020

1183
01:47:48,390 --> 01:47:52,520
where's the camera

1184
01:47:52,520 --> 01:48:08,800
did I just lose everything

1185
01:48:08,800 --> 01:48:11,800
why would it do that

1186
01:48:11,800 --> 01:48:14,800
did that actually work

1187
01:48:14,800 --> 01:48:24,510
I did all that work and then I said save performance

1188
01:48:24,510 --> 01:48:28,579
and it just exited the screen

1189
01:48:28,579 --> 01:48:31,579
is this going to save the camera shit

1190
01:48:31,579 --> 01:48:36,869
I hope so

1191
01:48:36,869 --> 01:48:47,640
it will not

1192
01:48:47,640 --> 01:48:58,609

I'm so confused at how that works

1194
01:49:01,609 --> 01:49:04,609
I did everything and on the top left it said save performance

1195
01:49:05,609 --> 01:49:27,329
can I watch that now

1196
01:49:27,329 --> 01:49:30,760
because I can't

1197
01:49:30,760 --> 01:49:33,760
where's my

1198
01:49:33,760 --> 01:49:36,760
hold trigger to record that's like what I did

1199
01:49:36,760 --> 01:49:42,369
that's kind of an odd menu system

1200
01:49:42,369 --> 01:49:54,300
because now

1201
01:49:54,300 --> 01:49:57,300
I've misclicked when trying to save

1202
01:49:57,300 --> 01:50:08,520
the recording thing is still red

1203
01:50:08,520 --> 01:50:11,520
how do I watch it from here

1204
01:50:11,520 --> 01:50:14,520
there's no real clear indication of

1205
01:50:14,520 --> 01:50:17,520
when I record like this

1206
01:50:17,520 --> 01:50:25,609
where does it go

1207
01:50:25,609 --> 01:50:31,479
I'm just going to go to the menu to see what happens

1208
01:50:31,479 --> 01:50:47,550
I'm just going to go back

1209
01:50:47,550 --> 01:50:55,699
sharing to stream

1210
01:50:55,699 --> 01:50:58,699
saving the performance overwrites the camera data

1211
01:50:58,699 --> 01:51:13,270
why the hell would that happen

1212
01:51:13,270 --> 01:51:16,270
it's working right

1213
01:51:16,270 --> 01:51:19,270
oh

1214
01:51:19,270 --> 01:51:22,270
ok

1215
01:51:22,270 --> 01:51:25,270
I scheduled

1216
01:51:25,270 --> 01:51:28,270
I don't know what you are telling me

1217
01:51:28,270 --> 01:51:31,270
did that work

1218
01:51:31,270 --> 01:51:34,270
I'm so confused

1219
01:51:34,270 --> 01:51:37,270
hey you dirty

1220
01:51:37,270 --> 01:51:40,270
dirty

1221
01:51:40,270 --> 01:51:43,270
you can do it

1222
01:51:43,270 --> 01:51:43,909
You can do it!

1223
01:51:43,909 --> 01:51:45,409
I mean, I can't believe you can do it.

1224
01:51:46,409 --> 01:51:48,539
You got like, 3.6 on you.

1225
01:51:48,539 --> 01:51:49,539
I think it's just doin' it.

1226
01:51:49,539 --> 01:51:50,300
Come on, suffer.

1227
01:51:51,300 --> 01:51:52,500
What the fuck is happening?

1228
01:51:52,500 --> 01:51:55,000
You can at least get your cell phone out and film this.

1229
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:56,199
This is getting a lot of video.

1230
01:51:56,199 --> 01:51:57,199
No, it's working.

1231
01:51:57,199 --> 01:51:58,300
Some of these people aren't even alive.

1232
01:51:58,300 --> 01:51:58,899
That's a skeleton.

1233
01:51:58,899 --> 01:52:00,500
Hey, I just proved I'm a playlist, man.

1234
01:52:01,500 --> 01:52:02,800
Am I gonna make you in the scene?

1235
01:52:02,800 --> 01:52:04,699
Yeah, it's a custom playlist.

1236
01:52:04,699 --> 01:52:06,199
It gets people hooked up in the Zoom.

1237
01:52:06,199 --> 01:52:08,199
I gotta stab her in the head so that I don't hurt her.

1238
01:52:08,199 --> 01:52:08,899
Yeah, okay.

1239
01:52:08,899 --> 01:52:10,300
Well, let's try it a little bit.

1240
01:52:10,300 --> 01:52:11,100
I'm just gonna wait.

1241
01:52:12,460 --> 01:52:13,260
Did I do it?

1242
01:52:14,159 --> 01:52:15,859
What the hell is going on here?

1243
01:52:20,300 --> 01:52:21,600
What the fuck?

1244
01:52:33,770 --> 01:52:35,670
Does anybody have any idea what the fuck is happening?

1245
01:52:38,920 --> 01:52:41,920
It just went, it's going crazy and now it's like doing the thing.

1246
01:52:47,039 --> 01:52:48,739
It was rendering, was it though?

1247
01:52:49,340 --> 01:52:50,340
I feel like that's the beginning.

1248
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:01,600
Did I have too conflicting takes?

1249
01:53:01,600 --> 01:53:02,600
Nah, I don't think so.

1250
01:53:18,460 --> 01:53:21,359
I mean, it's exporting, but it's exporting like, incorrectly.

1251
01:53:26,819 --> 01:53:31,420
So if I like even, if I even touch right trigger at all,

1252
01:53:31,819 --> 01:53:32,819
it deletes the whole thing.

1253
01:53:33,720 --> 01:53:36,020
You'd think there'd be like a confirmation there or something.

1254
01:53:36,119 --> 01:53:38,619
Like, oh, you sure you want to like delete all the camera shit you just did?

1255
01:53:40,960 --> 01:53:42,159
I don't, I don't think I did that though.

1256
01:53:50,039 --> 01:53:52,140
That's the multiple takes at the beginning.

1257
01:53:52,239 --> 01:53:53,439
Oh, okay.

1258
01:53:54,840 --> 01:53:55,739
How do I get out of here?

1259
01:54:04,020 --> 01:54:05,119
How do I get out of here?

1260
01:54:07,670 --> 01:54:08,069
What?

1261
01:54:19,460 --> 01:54:20,659
Did I beat the game?

1262
01:54:23,560 --> 01:54:24,560
This is all fucked up.

1263
01:54:30,260 --> 01:54:31,159
Okay, come back.

1264
01:54:32,640 --> 01:54:34,239
View, viewer position.

1265
01:54:34,239 --> 01:54:35,539
What the fuck is happening?

1266
01:54:39,020 --> 01:54:40,119
So I have to do that again.

1267
01:54:47,850 --> 01:54:48,750
So this is the very beginning.

1268
01:54:49,149 --> 01:54:49,750
God damn it.

1269
01:54:49,750 --> 01:54:50,149
All right.

1270
01:54:51,600 --> 01:54:52,100
Fuck.

1271
01:54:52,500 --> 01:54:53,300
That was done.

1272
01:55:00,800 --> 01:55:01,199
All right.

1273
01:55:01,199 --> 01:55:02,800
So let's do it again.

1274
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:04,800
What a pain in the ass.

1275
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:23,699
I'll make it quick.

1276
01:55:44,479 --> 01:55:45,479
No, back up here, back up here.

1277
01:55:56,060 --> 01:56:01,640
All right, slowly but surely.

1278
01:56:49,890 --> 01:56:51,090
Some of these people aren't even alive.

1279
01:57:29,689 --> 01:57:30,090
All right.

1280
01:57:30,090 --> 01:57:30,590
Okay.

1281
01:57:30,789 --> 01:57:31,289
All right.

1282
01:57:31,770 --> 01:57:32,670
Nobody move.

1283
01:57:34,399 --> 01:57:35,100
Nobody move.

1284
01:57:44,869 --> 01:57:45,569
I got it.

1285
01:57:46,460 --> 01:57:48,159
So now it's ready.

1286
01:57:50,130 --> 01:57:51,329
I didn't need to do this.

1287
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:54,199
It's already saved.

1288
01:57:55,260 --> 01:57:56,159
Well, but what about the camera?

1289
01:57:56,159 --> 01:57:57,359
Like freaking out all over the place?

1290
01:57:57,359 --> 01:57:58,960
Because I did like the multiple tapes, right?

1291
01:58:01,859 --> 01:58:03,460
I didn't need to redo it.

1292
01:58:04,260 --> 01:58:05,260
Oh, it already did it.

1293
01:58:05,260 --> 01:58:06,460
Oh, what the fuck?

1294
01:58:07,340 --> 01:58:07,539
All right.

1295
01:58:07,539 --> 01:58:08,840
Let's watch the damn thing.

1296
01:58:12,020 --> 01:58:12,619
You ready?

1297
01:58:24,119 --> 01:58:24,920
No.

1298
01:58:26,220 --> 01:58:27,420
No, play it.

1299
01:58:49,239 --> 01:58:51,439
I just practiced it needs to render.

1300
01:58:51,939 --> 01:58:52,840
All right, but like

1301
01:58:53,939 --> 01:58:56,340
so what not save performance from here.

1302
01:59:01,920 --> 01:59:02,920
Look at my computer.

1303
01:59:06,479 --> 01:59:07,079
What about it?

1304
01:59:07,890 --> 01:59:08,590
What are you talking about?

1305
01:59:15,119 --> 01:59:16,520
Labs is the culprit.

1306
01:59:17,899 --> 01:59:20,500
So you tell me if I click on save performance

1307
01:59:20,899 --> 01:59:23,399
or if I click on more and I do save.

1308
01:59:28,279 --> 01:59:28,880
Yeah, I okay.

1309
01:59:28,880 --> 01:59:30,880
I know it saves it in documents folder, but

1310
01:59:33,380 --> 01:59:40,350
so if I go to export right now the files are on yeah,

1311
01:59:40,350 --> 01:59:42,850
but like how do I know it's even saving what I just did?

1312
01:59:46,789 --> 01:59:47,189
All right.

1313
01:59:47,189 --> 01:59:47,590
Hold on.

1314
01:59:53,479 --> 01:59:55,279
Documents mind show videos.

1315
01:59:55,279 --> 01:59:55,779
Okay.

1316
01:59:56,180 --> 01:59:59,109
What the fuck?

1317
02:00:08,869 --> 02:00:12,779
I see it, but it's all fucked up.

1318
02:00:13,880 --> 02:00:14,180
All right.

1319
02:00:14,180 --> 02:00:16,880
So it's the cameras all fucked up.

1320
02:00:16,880 --> 02:00:18,380
It's all shaking around like crazy.

1321
02:00:20,250 --> 02:00:21,750
I don't know why it's doing this.

1322
02:00:23,140 --> 02:00:24,340
Holy shit.

1323
02:00:24,340 --> 02:00:25,539
It's so fucked up.

1324
02:00:30,279 --> 02:00:31,479
What the fuck?

1325
02:00:35,199 --> 02:00:35,500
All right.

1326
02:00:35,500 --> 02:00:38,399
I'm going to export this one and see what happens.

1327
02:00:42,250 --> 02:00:43,649
Yeah, this video is all fucked up.

1328
02:00:46,300 --> 02:00:46,800
It's the same.

1329
02:00:50,439 --> 02:00:51,640
I'll show you the curse after.

1330
02:00:52,380 --> 02:00:53,479
I'm going to try to save this one.

1331
02:00:53,479 --> 02:00:53,979
So all right.

1332
02:00:53,979 --> 02:00:54,680
Let me get this straight.

1333
02:00:54,680 --> 02:00:58,180
Save performance export video, right?

1334
02:01:05,819 --> 02:01:09,609
My god, this shouldn't be this complicated.

1335
02:01:12,750 --> 02:01:14,050
Save performance.

1336
02:01:16,579 --> 02:01:16,979
What?

1337
02:01:16,979 --> 02:01:17,279
All right.

1338
02:01:17,279 --> 02:01:19,869
The export.

1339
02:01:20,470 --> 02:01:21,069
Where is it?

1340
02:01:24,560 --> 02:01:28,000
What you see what I'm talking about?

1341
02:01:29,859 --> 02:01:30,859
What happened to it?

1342
02:01:37,489 --> 02:01:46,489
Share 60 FPS.

1343
02:01:48,989 --> 02:01:49,890
It's gonna work.

1344
02:01:51,989 --> 02:01:53,189
I can't hear this anymore.

1345
02:01:53,390 --> 02:01:54,189
You just dropped away.

1346
02:01:55,189 --> 02:01:57,390
There's a surgery scheduled in 20 minutes.

1347
02:01:57,390 --> 02:01:59,090
I know there's a surgery scheduled.

1348
02:01:59,489 --> 02:02:00,489
I scheduled it.

1349
02:02:07,270 --> 02:02:08,270
I think this is working.

1350
02:02:22,600 --> 02:02:23,000
All right.

1351
02:02:23,600 --> 02:02:26,800
If you've got a save performance button in the top left.

1352
02:02:27,399 --> 02:02:29,500
You got to go right to another menu after that.

1353
02:02:30,300 --> 02:02:31,600
You can just fuck it all up.

1354
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:37,300
I thought like save performance, save it and save it.

1355
02:02:39,399 --> 02:02:40,600
But it's not like the video.

1356
02:02:40,600 --> 02:02:41,800
They're two separate entities.

1357
02:02:48,439 --> 02:02:48,840
Okay.

1358
02:02:48,939 --> 02:02:49,439
All right.

1359
02:02:50,770 --> 02:02:52,670
It's time to watch that video.

1360
02:02:52,670 --> 02:02:53,569
Oh, thank God.

1361
02:02:53,569 --> 02:02:54,470
It's finally done.

1362
02:03:09,100 --> 02:03:10,399
Time for the next scene.

1363
02:03:15,149 --> 02:03:17,449
Well, there wasn't no tutorial on that one.

1364
02:03:18,479 --> 02:03:19,479
I had to just guess.

1365
02:03:30,960 --> 02:03:32,159
We're not going to watch this one.

1366
02:03:32,159 --> 02:03:33,460
We've seen this one so many times.

1367
02:03:33,859 --> 02:03:34,460
Like this one.

1368
02:03:34,460 --> 02:03:35,960
I don't want to hear the wait thing.

1369
02:03:35,960 --> 02:03:37,159
We'll watch them all at the end.

1370
02:03:44,819 --> 02:03:46,020
They see the skeleton in there.

1371
02:03:46,020 --> 02:03:47,119
You see the skeleton?

1372
02:03:51,119 --> 02:03:52,819
I don't want to hear that fucking line anymore.

1373
02:04:01,470 --> 02:04:01,770
All right.

1374
02:04:01,770 --> 02:04:05,170
I know now I know how to save and export performances.

1375
02:04:05,670 --> 02:04:06,670
I figured it out.

1376
02:04:10,970 --> 02:04:12,770
Some of these people aren't even alive.

1377
02:04:13,069 --> 02:04:14,569
That's a skeleton in there.

1378
02:04:21,989 --> 02:04:23,289
Yeah, I'm going to put all these awkward.

1379
02:04:23,289 --> 02:04:24,789
I'll do a compilation at the end of the stream.

1380
02:04:28,350 --> 02:04:30,350
It's a 3.4 on Yelp.

1381
02:04:31,590 --> 02:04:31,890
All right.

1382
02:04:31,890 --> 02:04:32,590
Next scene.

1383
02:04:32,989 --> 02:04:33,789
Give me an object.

1384
02:04:33,890 --> 02:04:34,689
Give me a place.

1385
02:04:34,989 --> 02:04:35,289
Oh, no, no.

1386
02:04:35,289 --> 02:04:36,090
I'm going to do the clip thing.

1387
02:04:36,289 --> 02:04:36,590
Right.

1388
02:04:38,659 --> 02:04:40,359
See if I can recreate the clip.

1389
02:04:50,329 --> 02:04:51,630
I do have to do a fight scene too.

1390
02:05:00,340 --> 02:05:02,039
Acknowledge the please for rat movie.

1391
02:05:02,039 --> 02:05:03,239
I can't do all.

1392
02:05:03,539 --> 02:05:09,310
I can't do the whole rat movie guys.

1393
02:05:09,310 --> 02:05:11,010
That's like fucking seven minutes.

1394
02:05:11,909 --> 02:05:15,310
I'm lucky to get one scene done with 30 seconds minute long.

1395
02:05:21,640 --> 02:05:23,340
That was like a painful procedure.

1396
02:05:29,449 --> 02:05:29,850
All right.

1397
02:05:30,880 --> 02:05:32,279
Give me a scene.

1398
02:05:32,279 --> 02:05:33,380
Give me an object.

1399
02:05:33,380 --> 02:05:33,979
Give me a thing.

1400
02:05:33,979 --> 02:05:34,479
Give me a person.

1401
02:05:34,479 --> 02:05:35,079
Give me a place.

1402
02:05:35,079 --> 02:05:35,579
Give me a thing.

1403
02:05:35,579 --> 02:05:36,180
Give me a noun.

1404
02:05:36,180 --> 02:05:36,680
Give me a verb.

1405
02:05:36,680 --> 02:05:37,380
Give me an adjective.

1406
02:05:37,380 --> 02:05:38,079
Give me an adverb.

1407
02:05:38,079 --> 02:05:40,680
Give me a conjunctivitis.

1408
02:05:47,470 --> 02:05:47,869
Force.

1409
02:05:47,869 --> 02:05:48,069
Okay.

1410
02:05:48,069 --> 02:05:48,569
I can't do that.

1411
02:05:48,569 --> 02:05:48,869
Sorry.

1412
02:05:49,170 --> 02:05:49,569
Believe me.

1413
02:05:51,590 --> 02:05:52,489
I'm going to wait for this to be done.

1414
02:06:13,689 --> 02:06:14,189
Go.

1415
02:06:14,590 --> 02:06:33,270
Hey, we're back.

1416
02:06:43,500 --> 02:06:44,300
We don't want to see this.

1417
02:06:44,300 --> 02:06:45,300
Get me out of here quick.

1418
02:06:46,340 --> 02:06:46,939
New scene.

1419
02:06:46,939 --> 02:06:47,439
Clear it.

1420
02:06:57,189 --> 02:06:57,989
Oh shit.

1421
02:06:58,289 --> 02:06:59,189
Oh, God damn it.

1422
02:06:59,489 --> 02:07:00,689
No, that's fine.

1423
02:07:01,819 --> 02:07:02,819
Just in case something goes wrong.

1424
02:07:04,430 --> 02:07:05,930
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1425
02:07:06,399 --> 02:07:06,800
Okay.

1426
02:07:06,800 --> 02:07:09,779
All right.

1427
02:07:09,779 --> 02:07:10,279
Clear it.

1428
02:07:11,210 --> 02:07:11,810
New place.

1429
02:07:12,109 --> 02:07:12,810
We need a...

1430
02:07:31,380 --> 02:07:31,779
Hello.

1431
02:07:33,119 --> 02:07:35,220
Hello and welcome to another episode.

1432
02:07:35,520 --> 02:07:36,520
Hello and welcome.

1433
02:07:37,119 --> 02:07:38,319
Hello and welcome.

1434
02:07:39,119 --> 02:07:39,619
Hello.

1435
02:08:15,199 --> 02:08:15,600
See you.

1436
02:08:16,789 --> 02:08:17,189
Deaf.

1437
02:08:22,779 --> 02:08:24,079
This one's going to be experimental.

1438
02:08:24,750 --> 02:08:28,850
We're going with an experimental poetry.

1439
02:08:33,319 --> 02:08:34,420
I'm not even doing that.

1440
02:08:34,619 --> 02:08:35,920
Do you see what happened here?

1441
02:08:35,920 --> 02:08:36,819
I'm not doing that.

1442
02:08:37,949 --> 02:08:39,350
I'm not doing that.

1443
02:08:39,750 --> 02:08:40,550
Stop it.

1444
02:08:50,859 --> 02:08:52,159
My father was fairly wealthy.

1445
02:08:53,529 --> 02:08:56,710
He would sometimes come home and shower us with gifts.

1446
02:08:57,609 --> 02:09:00,409
Various toys, trinkets, and the like.

1447
02:09:02,079 --> 02:09:03,979
But my father also brought something else into the house.

1448
02:09:05,270 --> 02:09:05,869
Animals.

1449
02:09:08,060 --> 02:09:08,960
Lots of animals.

1450
02:09:11,039 --> 02:09:12,840
See, he was a zoologist by trade.

1451
02:09:13,899 --> 02:09:18,270
And besides the money, which was great, we had an entire zoo in our backyard.

1452
02:09:20,100 --> 02:09:23,899
Although through the years, one would say that sharing a bed

1453
02:09:27,720 --> 02:09:31,850
with a giraffe is not so great.

1454
02:09:32,449 --> 02:09:33,149
After a while.

1455
02:09:34,890 --> 02:09:37,800
We grow distant, him and I.

1456
02:09:39,619 --> 02:09:43,720
The last time I spoke with him was July of 2006.

1457
02:09:45,039 --> 02:09:45,739
And here's why.

1458
02:09:47,020 --> 02:09:47,819
He killed my mother!

1459
02:09:47,819 --> 02:09:49,119
I don't know.

1460
02:09:49,119 --> 02:09:50,119
That was not enough time.

1461
02:09:51,920 --> 02:09:52,319
What?

1462
02:10:02,560 --> 02:10:10,640
Various toys, trinkets, animals.

1463
02:10:12,750 --> 02:10:13,750
This sucks.

1464
02:10:16,060 --> 02:10:17,659
He was a zoologist by trade.

1465
02:10:18,810 --> 02:10:23,140
And besides the money, which was great, we had an entire zoo in our backyard.

1466
02:10:24,939 --> 02:10:28,600
Although through the years, one would say that sharing a bed

1467
02:10:35,939 --> 02:10:36,539
was not so great.

1468
02:10:37,239 --> 02:10:38,939
I'm not going to do tons of like, cuts and shit.

1469
02:10:39,640 --> 02:10:40,539
We grow distant.

1470
02:10:41,039 --> 02:10:48,439
The last time I spoke with him was July of 2006.

1471
02:10:49,850 --> 02:10:50,550
And here's why.

1472
02:10:51,739 --> 02:10:52,640
He killed my mother!

1473
02:10:52,640 --> 02:10:53,239
I don't know why.

1474
02:10:55,119 --> 02:10:55,720
Are you ready?

1475
02:11:07,020 --> 02:11:08,119
My father was fairly wealthy.

1476
02:11:17,159 --> 02:11:20,060
He would sometimes come home and shower us with gifts.

1477
02:11:20,960 --> 02:11:23,760
Various toys, trinkets, and the like.

1478
02:11:34,380 --> 02:11:36,079
But my father also brought something else into the house.

1479
02:11:37,500 --> 02:11:38,000
Animals.

1480
02:11:38,399 --> 02:11:41,000
Lots of animals.

1481
02:11:43,500 --> 02:11:45,000
He was a zoologist by trade.

1482
02:11:57,439 --> 02:12:01,579

Although through the years, one would say that sharing a bed

1484
02:12:08,880 --> 02:12:09,380
Ow!

1485
02:12:21,560 --> 02:12:22,159
was not so great.

1486
02:12:29,880 --> 02:12:30,680
We grow distant.

1487
02:12:31,180 --> 02:12:38,550
The last time I spoke with him was July of 2006.

1488
02:12:47,300 --> 02:12:47,800
And here's why.

1489
02:12:53,229 --> 02:12:54,130
He killed my mother!

1490
02:12:58,579 --> 02:12:59,579
This one sucks.

1491
02:13:12,409 --> 02:13:13,510
My father was fairly wealthy.

1492
02:13:14,810 --> 02:13:18,079
He would sometimes come home and shower us with gifts.

1493

02:13:21,779 --> 02:13:25,319
But my father also brought something else into the house.

1495
02:13:26,720 --> 02:13:27,220
Animals.

1498
02:13:41,609 --> 02:13:45,350
Although through the years, one would say that sharing a bed

1499
02:13:47,699 --> 02:13:48,899
I'm trying to think of an animal.

1500
02:13:49,100 --> 02:13:50,600
I was so desperately thinking of an animal.

1501
02:13:53,699 --> 02:13:55,199
You can feel the cogs turning there.

1502
02:13:56,430 --> 02:13:57,229
We grow distant.

1503
02:13:57,729 --> 02:14:05,130
The last time I spoke with him was July of 2006.

1504
02:14:06,609 --> 02:14:07,210
And here's why.

1505
02:14:08,529 --> 02:14:09,329
He killed my mother!

1506
02:14:19,779 --> 02:14:21,979
Hey, I make sure to scream at the end.

1507
02:14:28,140 --> 02:14:29,140
Look at this camera work.

1508
02:14:29,140 --> 02:14:30,039
You don't think I know what I'm doing?

1509
02:14:33,699 --> 02:14:35,600
You don't think I didn't go to school for this shit?

1510
02:14:41,720 --> 02:14:42,420
Mods, please.

1511
02:14:42,420 --> 02:14:42,920
What's going on?

1512
02:14:45,659 --> 02:14:47,260
Don't turn that into a coffee pasta.

1513
02:14:47,260 --> 02:14:48,060
Jesus Christ.

1514
02:14:53,180 --> 02:14:53,680
God.

1515
02:15:01,470 --> 02:15:02,270
July of what?

1516
02:15:03,109 --> 02:15:04,510
Various toys, trinkets.

1517
02:15:04,510 --> 02:15:05,310
That was just...

1518
02:15:06,210 --> 02:15:07,210
Alright, so, you know...

1519
02:15:08,350 --> 02:15:11,850
When words just come out, but they mean absolutely nothing.

1520
02:15:12,850 --> 02:15:14,750
Words were just coming out of my mouth.

1521
02:15:15,729 --> 02:15:17,329
And they meant nothing.

1522
02:15:17,930 --> 02:15:19,430
It was just word soup.

1523
02:15:19,430 --> 02:15:20,430
It didn't mean anything.

1524
02:15:20,430 --> 02:15:21,529
It wasn't going anywhere.

1525
02:15:21,529 --> 02:15:22,529
It was just a...

1526
02:15:22,529 --> 02:15:24,130
It was a run-on sentence.

1527
02:15:44,529 --> 02:15:45,630
Fix the audio, DC.

1528
02:15:45,630 --> 02:15:46,130
I don't know what...

1529
02:15:46,130 --> 02:15:46,430
Hold on.

1530
02:15:46,430 --> 02:15:47,229
What are you talking about?

1531
02:15:50,539 --> 02:15:50,939
What are you...

1532
02:15:50,939 --> 02:15:51,439
Hold on.

1533
02:15:51,439 --> 02:15:51,939
Ready? Like...

1534
02:15:52,939 --> 02:15:56,020
It should be...

1535
02:15:56,020 --> 02:15:56,720
There's no sync.

1536
02:16:01,819 --> 02:16:02,619
Game audio.

1537
02:16:02,619 --> 02:16:03,720
That shouldn't be a thing.

1538
02:16:06,489 --> 02:16:07,890
Video has desync.

1539
02:16:09,539 --> 02:16:09,840
Alright.

1540
02:16:09,840 --> 02:16:11,140
But how much?

1541
02:16:11,939 --> 02:16:15,560
Already?

1542
02:16:16,800 --> 02:16:17,500
Let's do a test.

1543
02:16:18,399 --> 02:16:18,899
I wanna see.

1544
02:16:21,500 --> 02:16:22,699
It's three seconds.

1545
02:16:22,699 --> 02:16:24,300
What the fuck are you talking about?

1546
02:16:24,300 --> 02:16:24,800
What?

1547
02:16:26,060 --> 02:16:26,560
What?

1548
02:16:29,100 --> 02:16:31,100
It's three seconds of desync?

1549
02:16:31,100 --> 02:16:32,100
No way.

1550
02:16:33,510 --> 02:16:34,510
You gotta be kidding me.

1551
02:16:34,510 --> 02:16:35,409
What the fuck are you...

1552
02:16:35,409 --> 02:16:35,709
What?

1553
02:16:35,709 --> 02:16:36,610
Are you serious?

1554
02:16:37,909 --> 02:16:38,510
Why?

1555
02:16:38,909 --> 02:16:40,010
That doesn't make any sense.

1556
02:16:41,969 --> 02:16:42,969
How does that make any sense?

1557
02:16:44,170 --> 02:16:44,469
Alright.

1558
02:16:44,469 --> 02:16:44,969
Hold on a minute.

1559
02:16:44,969 --> 02:16:46,069
I gotta do some testing here.

1560
02:16:48,219 --> 02:16:49,219
That makes no sense.

1561
02:16:52,940 --> 02:16:53,840
That makes no sense.

1562
02:16:53,840 --> 02:16:54,739
That makes no sense.

1563
02:16:56,899 --> 02:16:57,200
Save it.

1564
02:16:57,200 --> 02:16:57,799
Save this.

1565
02:17:01,750 --> 02:17:01,950
Alright.

1566
02:17:01,950 --> 02:17:02,450
You ready?

1567
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:04,299
Click.

1568
02:17:04,500 --> 02:17:04,799
Click.

1569
02:17:05,000 --> 02:17:05,299
Click.

1570
02:17:07,819 --> 02:17:09,219
Are you hearing that when I click it?

1571
02:17:17,110 --> 02:17:18,010
It's delayed.

1572
02:17:19,180 --> 02:17:19,379
Alright.

1573
02:17:19,379 --> 02:17:20,280
But by how much?

1574
02:17:20,379 --> 02:17:21,979
So are you hearing the...

1575
02:17:27,340 --> 02:17:28,440
It's actually bad.

1576
02:17:28,739 --> 02:17:29,940
I'm surprised.

1577
02:17:32,770 --> 02:17:33,069
No.

1578
02:17:33,069 --> 02:17:34,069
It is not five seconds.

1579
02:17:34,469 --> 02:17:36,670
Click comes way later in the video.

1580
02:17:36,670 --> 02:17:38,569
That's fucking strange.

1581
02:17:39,409 --> 02:17:40,610
That's strange.

1582
02:17:42,879 --> 02:17:43,079
Alright.

1583
02:17:43,079 --> 02:17:44,079
Hold on a second here.

1584
02:17:45,629 --> 02:17:47,430
So it comes way later.

1585
02:17:49,750 --> 02:17:50,950
It's like two seconds?

1586
02:17:56,370 --> 02:17:57,370
It's actually a couple...

1587
02:17:57,370 --> 02:17:58,469
That makes no sense.

1588
02:17:59,340 --> 02:18:00,139
Because of my...

1589
02:18:05,780 --> 02:18:06,780
It's to do with the game.

1590
02:18:06,780 --> 02:18:07,079
No.

1591
02:18:07,079 --> 02:18:07,479
That's weird.

1592
02:18:07,479 --> 02:18:08,879
Because on my screen it looks fine.

1593
02:18:09,680 --> 02:18:10,780
Let me see if I can delay this.

1594
02:18:11,579 --> 02:18:12,079
So...

1595
02:18:13,020 --> 02:18:14,319
Tell me if this changes anything.

1596
02:18:19,899 --> 02:18:20,700
I'm sorry guys.

1597
02:18:20,700 --> 02:18:21,500
That's really weird.

1598
02:18:26,729 --> 02:18:28,129
Tell me if this changes anything.

1599
02:18:29,709 --> 02:18:30,110
Ready?

1600
02:18:31,270 --> 02:18:31,670
Click.

1601
02:18:31,870 --> 02:18:32,170
Click.

1602
02:18:32,270 --> 02:18:32,770
Click.

1603
02:18:32,770 --> 02:18:33,270
Click.

1604
02:18:33,270 --> 02:18:33,770
Click.

1605
02:18:33,770 --> 02:18:34,270
Click.

1606
02:18:34,370 --> 02:18:34,870
Click.

1607
02:18:34,870 --> 02:18:35,370
Click.

1608
02:18:35,370 --> 02:18:35,870
Click.

1609
02:18:42,420 --> 02:18:43,219
Now it's worse.

1610
02:18:43,620 --> 02:18:45,750
Hold on a sec.

1611
02:18:53,920 --> 02:18:54,719
Let me try this.

1612
02:18:55,840 --> 02:18:56,739
I'm gonna try something here.

1613
02:18:59,079 --> 02:19:00,280
Tell me if this changes anything.

1614
02:19:10,459 --> 02:19:11,059
I gotta add a...

1615
02:19:11,059 --> 02:19:12,260
I'm gonna add a filter on it.

1616
02:19:12,459 --> 02:19:13,760
And see if I can just make it...

1617
02:19:15,280 --> 02:19:16,079
That's annoying.

1618
02:19:16,079 --> 02:19:16,579
Damn.

1619
02:19:20,430 --> 02:19:20,930
Wait, wait, wait.

1620
02:19:20,930 --> 02:19:22,430
Restart the game and it'll be fixed.

1621
02:19:22,430 --> 02:19:23,430
It's a known issue.

1622
02:19:23,430 --> 02:19:24,629
Oh, are you kidding me?

1623
02:19:25,229 --> 02:19:27,479
Okay.

1624
02:19:31,979 --> 02:19:32,479
Okay.

1625
02:19:32,479 --> 02:19:32,979
Alright.

1626
02:19:34,809 --> 02:19:35,610
I'm gonna restart.

1627
02:19:35,610 --> 02:19:36,110
We'll try it again.

1628
02:19:36,110 --> 02:19:36,809
I saved that one.

1629
02:19:36,809 --> 02:19:38,010
So that one's ready to watch later.

1630
02:19:38,409 --> 02:19:40,010
Let me make sure these are actually coming out okay.

1631
02:19:40,010 --> 02:19:44,510
Because this would be a disaster if later on I put a giant like 8-minute compilation and they all suck.

1632
02:19:44,909 --> 02:19:45,809
They all don't do anything.

1633
02:19:54,270 --> 02:19:54,870
No, that's good.

1634
02:20:08,659 --> 02:20:09,459
Well, they work.

1635
02:20:09,459 --> 02:20:10,559
I'll just put it that way.

1636
02:20:17,100 --> 02:20:17,799
Alright, we're good.

1637
02:20:19,760 --> 02:20:21,559
I'm gonna restart the game apparently.

1638
02:20:26,489 --> 02:20:27,489
Jerma is upset.

1639
02:20:27,690 --> 02:20:28,889
No, I just wanna make sure it's not...

1640
02:20:29,389 --> 02:20:30,889
It's not like a huge delay.

1641
02:20:32,469 --> 02:20:32,870
You know?

1642
02:20:34,319 --> 02:20:35,520
That'd be like kind of hard to watch.

1643
02:20:37,010 --> 02:20:38,709
Great Canadian Fuck Club 5 community subs.

1644
02:20:38,709 --> 02:20:39,610
Thanks a lot, Great Canadian.

1645
02:20:41,579 --> 02:20:42,280
Thank you for the five.

1646
02:20:42,979 --> 02:20:44,479
I've not been paying much attention to bit...

1647
02:20:44,479 --> 02:20:45,379
I really can't.

1648
02:20:45,879 --> 02:20:48,079
Streamlabs has turned off for VR.

1649
02:20:48,850 --> 02:20:49,549
As you're aware.

1650
02:20:51,440 --> 02:20:53,040
Let's reopen it and see if it fixes it.

1651
02:20:58,489 --> 02:20:58,989
Get in there.

1652
02:20:59,899 --> 02:21:00,500
Get in there.

1653
02:21:02,809 --> 02:21:03,510
Get in there.

1654
02:21:04,450 --> 02:21:05,149
Get in there!

1655
02:21:10,340 --> 02:21:10,840
Okay.

1656
02:21:11,770 --> 02:21:12,370
You tell me.

1657
02:21:22,719 --> 02:21:23,420
Hey, thanks.

1658
02:21:23,420 --> 02:21:24,520
Welcome to Mind Show.

1659
02:21:25,319 --> 02:21:25,920
Okay, you ready?

1660
02:21:28,219 --> 02:21:28,719
You tell me.

1661
02:21:34,590 --> 02:21:35,389
You should be hearing like...

1662
02:21:37,489 --> 02:21:42,620
My chat.

1663
02:21:57,100 --> 02:21:57,399
It's...

1664
02:21:58,569 --> 02:22:00,069
I have no idea why the fuck that's happening.

1665
02:22:09,290 --> 02:22:10,989
It's the game audio that's delayed.

1666
02:22:12,409 --> 02:22:13,610
I wonder if I should just...

1667
02:22:15,059 --> 02:22:16,459
Delay all the audio then.

1668
02:22:20,079 --> 02:22:21,180
Let me see what it sounds like.

1669
02:22:24,120 --> 02:22:24,920
That's really odd.

1670
02:22:27,870 --> 02:22:28,270
Ready?

1671
02:22:28,469 --> 02:22:37,850
I'm ready.

1672
02:22:38,149 --> 02:22:56,090
I have no words for why that's happening.

1673
02:22:56,090 --> 02:22:56,389
Hold on.

1674
02:22:56,389 --> 02:22:57,190
Let me try something.

1675
02:23:04,780 --> 02:23:07,180
That's like a six second fucking delay.

1676
02:23:09,819 --> 02:23:10,420
Alright, hold on.

1677
02:23:10,420 --> 02:23:10,819
Ready?

1678
02:23:12,520 --> 02:23:13,920
Can I delay this?

1679
02:23:18,270 --> 02:23:20,270
Yeah, I'm gonna delay the video and mix the audio.

1680
02:23:22,540 --> 02:23:23,040
Jesus.

1681
02:23:25,860 --> 02:23:26,360
Why can I...

1682
02:23:26,360 --> 02:23:27,659
I can't add a filter on here.

1683
02:23:33,559 --> 02:23:34,559
I need to delay.

1684
02:23:39,479 --> 02:23:40,579
So if you're hearing it like...

1685
02:23:40,579 --> 02:23:41,479
Let me see if this works.

1686
02:23:46,409 --> 02:23:47,209
Tell me how this works.

1687
02:23:47,209 --> 02:23:47,510
Ready?

1688
02:23:50,200 --> 02:23:50,700
I'm sorry.

1689
02:23:50,700 --> 02:23:50,899
I...

1690
02:23:50,899 --> 02:23:52,700
This is an issue I've never run into before.

1691
02:23:53,819 --> 02:23:54,219
Alright, ready?

1692
02:23:54,219 --> 02:23:54,920
So it's like...

1693
02:23:56,920 --> 02:23:58,020
Let's just say it's like this.

1694
02:24:01,000 --> 02:24:02,700
And put the mic delayed too.

1695
02:24:09,299 --> 02:24:10,000
So now...

1696
02:24:12,590 --> 02:24:13,790
You tell me if this change...

1697
02:24:13,790 --> 02:24:15,690
That it's gonna be delayed even worse.

1698
02:24:18,969 --> 02:24:21,770
Because now my motions will be delayed but the audio won't.

1699
02:24:22,370 --> 02:24:22,770
Ready?

1700
02:24:23,270 --> 02:24:24,670
One, two, three.

1701
02:24:25,610 --> 02:24:26,010
One.

1702
02:24:32,790 --> 02:24:33,790
Nah, it's even worse now.

1703
02:24:38,860 --> 02:24:39,360
Why would...

1704
02:24:39,559 --> 02:24:40,459
Why would that be happening?

1705
02:24:47,059 --> 02:24:48,459
Restarting SteamVR?

1706
02:24:48,559 --> 02:24:49,760
Yeah, maybe I'll try that.

1707
02:25:02,370 --> 02:25:05,370
This just started happening after you recorded the ghost character.

1708
02:25:05,370 --> 02:25:05,770
Okay.

1709
02:25:06,270 --> 02:25:06,670
So...

1710
02:25:08,620 --> 02:25:09,120
Let me...

1711
02:25:09,819 --> 02:25:11,420
Let me try a couple things.

1712
02:25:11,420 --> 02:25:12,520
I apologize everybody.

1713
02:25:14,479 --> 02:25:15,579
Give me like a couple minutes.

1714
02:25:15,579 --> 02:25:16,479
I'm gonna be right back.

1715
02:25:17,520 --> 02:25:19,020
Let me like try to get this fixed.

1716
02:25:19,319 --> 02:25:20,719
I'm gonna restart SteamVR.

1717
02:25:22,889 --> 02:25:23,989
And I mean, of course.

1718
02:25:25,030 --> 02:25:25,930
Get another one of these.

1719
02:25:36,590 --> 02:25:36,989
Fuck.

1720
02:25:37,850 --> 02:25:40,149
Well, this is gonna be a technical troubleshooting stream.

1721
02:25:44,180 --> 02:25:44,879
God damn it.

1722
02:25:47,100 --> 02:25:47,899
Alright, I'll be right back.

1723
02:25:49,280 --> 02:25:50,180
See if I can get this fixed.

1724
02:30:36,520 --> 02:30:37,920
Alright, come on.

1725
02:30:39,219 --> 02:30:40,420
Don't do it to me.

1726
02:30:41,219 --> 02:30:42,420
Don't do this to me.

1727
02:30:43,790 --> 02:30:46,590
I've got so much going on right now in the VR.

1728
02:30:49,559 --> 02:30:49,959
Fuck.

1729
02:30:51,360 --> 02:30:51,959
I'm trying.

1730
02:30:54,260 --> 02:30:55,360
I'm trying.

1731
02:30:56,709 --> 02:30:57,809
The effort is here.

1732
02:31:01,360 --> 02:31:02,059
Come on, work.

1733
02:31:02,059 --> 02:31:06,270
Get back on camera so we can test it again.

1734
02:31:10,940 --> 02:31:11,940
Yeah, um...

1735
02:31:12,610 --> 02:31:14,209
I really don't know what to do with my hair.

1736
02:31:14,510 --> 02:31:16,110
I was thinking maybe let it grow out a little.

1737
02:31:16,510 --> 02:31:18,610
And then maybe you can trim it and change it a little.

1738
02:31:21,329 --> 02:31:22,229
Uh, sir.

1739
02:31:23,319 --> 02:31:24,719
Sir, this isn't human hair.

1740
02:31:26,420 --> 02:31:27,120
Oh, I know.

1741
02:31:27,120 --> 02:31:29,420
But I took a little bit of uncooked spaghetti.

1742
02:31:29,819 --> 02:31:31,319
And then put it on here.

1743
02:31:31,719 --> 02:31:32,620
Can you still do something with it?

1744
02:31:32,620 --> 02:31:33,520
Can you still work with it?

1745
02:31:35,799 --> 02:31:36,500
That's an old joke.

1746
02:31:36,500 --> 02:31:37,299
He said that before.

1747
02:31:39,260 --> 02:31:40,360
Welcome to Mind Show.

1748
02:31:40,360 --> 02:31:41,459
Shaved your beard?

1749
02:31:43,379 --> 02:31:43,680
No.

1750
02:31:44,540 --> 02:31:46,139
I'm gonna grow it until it's on the fucking floor.

1751
02:31:49,959 --> 02:31:50,659
That was an old joke.

1752
02:31:50,659 --> 02:31:50,959
It was.

1753
02:31:50,959 --> 02:31:51,260
I know.

1754
02:31:51,360 --> 02:31:52,059
Who cares?

1755
02:31:52,360 --> 02:31:53,260
This is just what happens.

1756
02:31:56,020 --> 02:31:57,920
My appearance is at the bottom of the ladder right now.

1757
02:31:58,020 --> 02:31:59,719
Stream functioning is up here.

1758
02:32:00,219 --> 02:32:00,920
Appearance?

1759
02:32:01,020 --> 02:32:01,620
Who cares?

1760
02:32:03,770 --> 02:32:05,170
I don't want this delay to be a fucking thing.

1761
02:32:07,379 --> 02:32:08,180
Pubic hair.

1762
02:32:10,709 --> 02:32:12,010
Nah, I was gonna give you the finger.

1763
02:32:12,010 --> 02:32:13,010
I was thinking about it.

1764
02:32:15,260 --> 02:32:16,559
Oh, I was thinking it was supposed to come up.

1765
02:32:16,860 --> 02:32:17,159
See?

1766
02:32:17,459 --> 02:32:18,559
Oh, I'm trying to keep it.

1767
02:32:18,559 --> 02:32:19,459
Just don't do that.

1768
02:32:19,760 --> 02:32:20,459
Okay, we're fine.

1769
02:32:28,329 --> 02:32:29,430
Uh, you guys are gonna have to help me.

1770
02:32:29,430 --> 02:32:30,530
Let's see if I can test it.

1771
02:32:36,940 --> 02:32:37,540
All right.

1772
02:32:38,500 --> 02:32:39,200
You tell me.

1773
02:32:40,780 --> 02:32:41,479
Are we fixed?

1774
02:32:43,260 --> 02:32:43,659
Ready?

1775
02:32:46,149 --> 02:32:50,280
Click, click, click, click, click, click.

1776
02:32:57,290 --> 02:33:05,899
No, it happened.

1777
02:33:09,059 --> 02:33:10,159
What the fuck happened?

1778
02:33:12,729 --> 02:33:14,030
I don't understand what happened.

1779
02:33:14,229 --> 02:33:17,530
You tell me this started after I went into the ghost thing?

1780
02:33:18,690 --> 02:33:20,190
I restarted SteamVR.

1781
02:33:22,450 --> 02:33:23,549
It's even lighter now.

1782
02:33:26,659 --> 02:33:27,260
Shit.

1783
02:33:33,030 --> 02:33:34,930
I'm gonna try one more thing and we're just gonna move on.

1784
02:33:34,930 --> 02:33:35,430
We're gonna go.

1785
02:33:36,030 --> 02:33:36,530
I got to.

1786
02:33:36,530 --> 02:33:38,530
I can't just fucking do this all day, you know, guys.

1787
02:33:38,530 --> 02:33:39,030
Sorry.

1788
02:33:42,969 --> 02:33:45,569
I can't just like do this all fucking day.

1789
02:33:46,270 --> 02:33:46,870
God damn it.

1790
02:33:47,170 --> 02:33:48,069
Let me try one more thing.

1791
02:33:53,000 --> 02:33:53,500
Hold on.

1792
02:33:55,170 --> 02:33:55,870
Shit.

1793
02:33:57,409 --> 02:34:00,409
Delay all the other audio and yeah, but I tried that before and

1794
02:34:01,549 --> 02:34:02,549
you can't queue it up.

1795
02:34:05,309 --> 02:34:07,110
Validate the game files for Mind Show.

1796
02:34:09,079 --> 02:34:10,079
I was having a lot of fun too.

1797
02:34:10,079 --> 02:34:10,879
God damn it.

1798
02:34:11,280 --> 02:34:12,180
I don't know what's going on.

1799
02:34:15,360 --> 02:34:16,559
Let me reboot again.

1800
02:34:20,479 --> 02:34:21,579
That was going somewhere too.

1801
02:34:21,579 --> 02:34:22,180
It really was.

1802
02:34:30,170 --> 02:34:32,469
Let's reboot VR again.

1803
02:34:33,780 --> 02:34:34,479
There it goes.

1804
02:34:36,020 --> 02:34:36,920
Let's see what happens.

1805
02:34:43,479 --> 02:34:45,680
I have to kill the chat too.

1806
02:34:45,680 --> 02:34:46,579
So sorry guys.

1807
02:34:47,180 --> 02:34:49,479
I won't be able to see what you're saying for testing purposes.

1808
02:34:56,209 --> 02:34:57,309
Welcome to Mind Show.

1809
02:34:59,600 --> 02:35:00,600
Last attempt.

1810
02:35:01,530 --> 02:35:04,930
Before I have to kind of, I guess just have to deal with it.

1811
02:35:04,930 --> 02:35:05,430
Maybe.

1812
02:35:11,709 --> 02:35:12,209
Ready?

1813
02:35:16,860 --> 02:35:19,159
Is this fixed?

1814
02:35:23,729 --> 02:35:24,329
We good?

1815
02:35:28,170 --> 02:35:29,870
Yeah, it's fixed.

1816
02:35:33,069 --> 02:35:33,770
Yeah.

1817
02:35:35,690 --> 02:35:36,290
Are you sure?

1818
02:35:43,159 --> 02:35:45,059
Hey, piece of pie.

1819
02:35:45,159 --> 02:35:45,459
Good?

1820
02:35:45,659 --> 02:35:47,170
I don't fuck.

1821
02:35:47,170 --> 02:35:48,170
What the hell was that?

1822
02:35:48,270 --> 02:35:52,049
I've been doing this for almost 10 years, right?

1823
02:35:52,450 --> 02:35:54,549
And sometimes like shit just don't make no sense.

1824
02:35:54,950 --> 02:35:56,649
It doesn't matter how much you try to get ready for something

1825
02:35:56,649 --> 02:35:58,649
to prepare and that shit makes no sense.

1826
02:35:59,250 --> 02:36:00,049
What happened?

1827
02:36:01,030 --> 02:36:02,629
I don't understand.

1828
02:36:03,670 --> 02:36:04,670
Fucking computers.

1829
02:36:04,770 --> 02:36:05,770
Don't ever buy one.

1830
02:36:06,440 --> 02:36:07,239
Just read a newspaper.

1831
02:36:07,239 --> 02:36:07,940
Do the crosswords.

1832
02:36:07,940 --> 02:36:08,639
Don't buy it.

1833
02:36:08,739 --> 02:36:09,940
Oh, I'm shredding off.

1834
02:36:10,239 --> 02:36:10,540
What?

1835
02:36:11,440 --> 02:36:12,440
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1836
02:36:12,440 --> 02:36:12,639
What?

1837
02:36:12,639 --> 02:36:13,239
What's going on?

1838
02:36:15,620 --> 02:36:16,920
I didn't do anything.

1839
02:36:17,520 --> 02:36:19,219
I was playing the game and my computer.

1840
02:36:19,719 --> 02:36:20,819
Just only do crosswords.

1841
02:36:20,819 --> 02:36:22,020
Don't ever fucking buy a computer.

1842
02:36:23,659 --> 02:36:25,659
German, do you have any like specs I should buy?

1843
02:36:25,659 --> 02:36:27,760
Yeah, it's called fucking a book.

1844
02:36:28,459 --> 02:36:29,659
Go read Lord of the Rings.

1845
02:36:30,430 --> 02:36:31,430
Don't buy a computer.

1846
02:36:32,809 --> 02:36:33,110
All right.

1847
02:36:33,110 --> 02:36:33,610
I'm ready.

1848
02:36:34,579 --> 02:36:37,579
I can't do OVR drop right now.

1849
02:36:38,079 --> 02:36:39,780
I can't do the chat here yet.

1850
02:36:40,180 --> 02:36:40,979
We got to move on.

1851
02:36:40,979 --> 02:36:42,780
I got to make something and we'll go back to it.

1852
02:36:44,000 --> 02:36:44,899
I'm sorry guys.

1853
02:36:45,200 --> 02:36:46,399
I can't see the chat anymore.

1854
02:36:46,500 --> 02:36:47,500
Maybe that was the problem.

1855
02:36:49,440 --> 02:36:50,340
That might have been fucked up.

1856
02:36:50,340 --> 02:36:52,440
I don't know because I didn't have it on here.

1857
02:36:54,250 --> 02:36:54,950
Fuck.

1858
02:36:57,620 --> 02:36:58,219
What a disaster.

1859
02:36:58,219 --> 02:36:59,520
It's been like fucking 30 minutes.

1860
02:37:00,760 --> 02:37:02,959
Thank you for sticking around.

1861
02:37:03,729 --> 02:37:05,930
There was like 4,400, 4,300.

1862
02:37:05,930 --> 02:37:07,530
There's still like 4,000 people here almost.

1863
02:37:08,329 --> 02:37:08,729
Thanks.

1864
02:37:09,930 --> 02:37:11,729
Glad you could sit through this fucking nonsense.

1865
02:37:11,729 --> 02:37:12,229
Thank you.

1866
02:37:12,829 --> 02:37:13,329
Let's go.

1867
02:37:17,530 --> 02:37:18,030
I'm ready.

1868
02:37:24,680 --> 02:37:25,879
That wine is so gross.

1869
02:37:29,979 --> 02:37:36,370
I mean it just smells the way that tastes.

1870
02:37:36,370 --> 02:37:36,969
You know what I mean?

1871
02:37:36,969 --> 02:37:37,670
Like what the?

1872
02:37:40,360 --> 02:37:40,860
I'm ready.

1873
02:37:42,579 --> 02:37:43,979
I can't see you guys reactions.

1874
02:37:43,979 --> 02:37:44,680
I don't like this.

1875
02:37:47,479 --> 02:37:48,879
I need like reactions, man.

1876
02:37:48,879 --> 02:37:49,979
I'm a reaction streamer.

1877
02:37:52,350 --> 02:37:54,350
Dude, can you fucking believe what that thing is?

1878
02:37:54,450 --> 02:37:55,149
What the fuck?

1879
02:37:55,149 --> 02:37:56,049
I got shit in my eye.

1880
02:37:56,049 --> 02:37:57,350
God, no, I don't care.

1881
02:37:57,750 --> 02:37:58,450
Deal with the pain.

1882
02:37:58,950 --> 02:38:00,049
I got stuff in my eye.

1883
02:38:00,649 --> 02:38:01,950
I have charcoal in my eye.

1884
02:38:01,950 --> 02:38:02,350
I'm ready.

1885
02:38:02,350 --> 02:38:03,149
Create show.

1886
02:38:08,000 --> 02:38:08,600
Where are you?

1887
02:38:09,909 --> 02:38:12,719
I can't see anybody ready for this one.

1888
02:38:19,229 --> 02:38:19,629
I got it.

1889
02:38:21,040 --> 02:38:21,540
Oh, what?

1890
02:38:21,540 --> 02:38:22,239
Oh, I got it.

1891
02:38:23,459 --> 02:38:24,260
Check this shit up.

1892
02:38:53,809 --> 02:38:54,709
Lab mode is not on.

1893
02:38:54,709 --> 02:38:55,209
Don't worry.

1894
02:39:04,520 --> 02:39:05,020
Okay.

1895
02:39:05,829 --> 02:39:07,629
So who has the mythic key to do this?

1896
02:39:08,329 --> 02:39:09,530
We're a mythic plus eight.

1897
02:39:10,069 --> 02:39:11,670
So I mean you got to be ready to go.

1898
02:39:15,090 --> 02:39:15,989
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1899
02:39:15,989 --> 02:39:17,590
You see that I'm the guild leader.

1900
02:39:17,989 --> 02:39:19,889
So I determine when we open the door.

1901
02:39:21,139 --> 02:39:22,139
You're the key holder.

1902
02:39:22,540 --> 02:39:24,239
That's what it says on your resume.

1903
02:39:24,239 --> 02:39:26,040
On my resume, it's guild leader.

1904
02:39:27,469 --> 02:39:28,270
This can be tough.

1905
02:39:29,639 --> 02:39:29,940
Shut up.

1906
02:39:29,940 --> 02:39:30,940
You don't matter.

1907
02:39:31,040 --> 02:39:32,040
You don't matter.

1908
02:39:32,139 --> 02:39:32,639
Okay.

1909
02:39:46,000 --> 02:39:47,399
I love World of Warcraft.

1910
02:39:47,399 --> 02:39:47,799
Okay.

1911
02:39:47,899 --> 02:39:48,700
I can't wait to go over there.

1912
02:39:48,700 --> 02:39:50,399
So who has the mythic key to do this?

1913
02:39:50,500 --> 02:39:51,000
Oh, I do.

1914
02:39:51,000 --> 02:39:51,299
I do.

1915
02:39:51,299 --> 02:39:51,799
I got the key.

1916
02:39:51,799 --> 02:39:52,299
Plus eight.

1917
02:39:52,399 --> 02:39:53,500
Yeah, there's a mythic plus eight.

1918
02:39:53,500 --> 02:39:54,399
So you got to be ready to go.

1919
02:39:54,940 --> 02:39:55,340
I'm ready.

1920
02:39:55,340 --> 02:39:55,739
I'm ready.

1921
02:39:55,739 --> 02:39:57,840
I've been ready since there was extra run trying to me into the guild.

1922
02:39:57,840 --> 02:39:58,739
No, no, no, no, no.

1923
02:39:58,739 --> 02:40:00,340
You see that I'm the guild leader.

1924
02:40:00,540 --> 02:40:01,040
Yeah, I know.

1925
02:40:01,040 --> 02:40:02,639
So I determine when we open the door.

1926
02:40:02,639 --> 02:40:03,739
But can I open the door?

1927
02:40:04,040 --> 02:40:04,940
You're the key holder.

1928
02:40:05,239 --> 02:40:06,040
I am the key holder.

1929
02:40:06,040 --> 02:40:07,040
That's what it says on your resume.

1930
02:40:07,040 --> 02:40:08,840
On my resume, it's guild leader.

1931
02:40:09,639 --> 02:40:11,139
But we're called guild leaders.

1932
02:40:12,719 --> 02:40:13,620
You don't matter.

1933
02:40:13,620 --> 02:40:14,319
Yes, he does.

1934
02:40:14,520 --> 02:40:15,319
Yes, he does.

1935
02:40:19,520 --> 02:40:25,120
World of Warcraft.

1936
02:40:25,120 --> 02:40:25,620
Okay.

1937
02:40:25,620 --> 02:40:26,219
I can't wait to go over there.

1938
02:40:26,219 --> 02:40:27,920
So who has the mythic key to do this?

1939
02:40:27,920 --> 02:40:29,020
Guys, I got to go.

1940
02:40:29,020 --> 02:40:29,819
Plus eight.

1941
02:40:30,819 --> 02:40:32,819
My baby's going to be born in 45 minutes.

1942
02:40:32,819 --> 02:40:33,620
I've got to get out of here.

1943
02:40:33,620 --> 02:40:35,420
I've been ready since there was extra run trying to me into the guild.

1944
02:40:35,420 --> 02:40:36,219
No, no, no, no, no.

1945
02:40:36,219 --> 02:40:37,920
You see that I'm the guild leader.

1946
02:40:38,219 --> 02:40:38,620
Yeah, I know.

1947
02:40:38,620 --> 02:40:40,219
So I determine when we open the door.

1948
02:40:40,420 --> 02:40:41,620
But can I open the door after that?

1949
02:40:41,620 --> 02:40:42,319
You're the key holder.

1950
02:40:42,319 --> 02:40:43,620
Just open the fucking door.

1951
02:40:43,620 --> 02:40:44,120
I've got...

1952
02:40:44,120 --> 02:40:46,020
My baby's going to be born in 45 minutes.

1953
02:40:46,020 --> 02:40:46,920
Are you listening to me?

1954
02:40:48,180 --> 02:40:49,579
It's fucking raw.

1955
02:40:49,579 --> 02:40:50,379
Do you understand?

1956
02:40:50,379 --> 02:40:51,379
You don't matter.

1957
02:40:51,379 --> 02:40:52,280
Yes, I do.

1958
02:40:52,280 --> 02:40:53,079
Yes, he does.

1959
02:40:53,479 --> 02:40:55,549
Oh shit, I'm stepping.

1960
02:40:55,549 --> 02:40:56,350
I'm falling down.

1961
02:41:00,149 --> 02:41:01,450
World of Warcraft.

1962
02:41:01,450 --> 02:41:01,950
Okay.

1963
02:41:01,950 --> 02:41:02,649
I can't wait to go over there.

1964
02:41:02,649 --> 02:41:04,450
So who has the mythic key to do this?

1965
02:41:04,450 --> 02:41:05,450
Guys, I got to go.

1966
02:41:05,450 --> 02:41:06,250
Plus eight.

1967
02:41:06,549 --> 02:41:07,450
Yeah, it's the mythic part.

1968
02:41:07,450 --> 02:41:09,450
My baby's going to be born in 45 minutes.

1969
02:41:09,450 --> 02:41:11,850
I've been ready since there was extra run trying to me into the guild.

1970
02:41:11,850 --> 02:41:12,750
No, no, no, no, no.

1971
02:41:12,750 --> 02:41:14,350
You see that I'm the guild leader.

1972
02:41:14,649 --> 02:41:15,149
Yeah, I know.

1973
02:41:15,149 --> 02:41:16,750
So I determine when we open the door.

1974
02:41:16,750 --> 02:41:18,049
But can I open the door after that?

1975
02:41:18,049 --> 02:41:18,850
You're the key holder.

1976
02:41:18,850 --> 02:41:19,450
Just open the door.

1977
02:41:19,450 --> 02:41:20,750
My baby says I'm your resident.

1978
02:41:20,750 --> 02:41:22,649
My baby's going to be born in 45 minutes.

1979
02:41:22,649 --> 02:41:23,549
Are you listening to me?

1980
02:41:23,850 --> 02:41:26,149
Well, where Kogu is fucking raw.

1981
02:41:26,149 --> 02:41:26,750
Do you understand?

1982
02:41:26,750 --> 02:41:27,750
You don't matter.

1983
02:41:27,750 --> 02:41:29,549
Yes, he does.

1984
02:41:42,709 --> 02:41:43,510
We're going to start over.

1985
02:41:55,739 --> 02:41:56,340
That was...

1986
02:41:56,739 --> 02:41:58,340
That was not even worth saving.

1987
02:41:58,340 --> 02:41:58,840
Okay.

1988
02:41:59,540 --> 02:42:10,549
Okay, Mind Show news.

1989
02:42:11,350 --> 02:42:12,049
Crisis zone.

1990
02:42:12,049 --> 02:42:12,649
Is it weather?

1991
02:42:13,049 --> 02:42:13,549
Weather report.

1992
02:42:13,549 --> 02:42:14,049
Okay.

1993
02:42:19,709 --> 02:42:20,909
Let's get a crisis report.

1994
02:42:20,909 --> 02:42:21,610
Let's go over here.

1995
02:42:31,729 --> 02:42:32,030
All right.

1996
02:42:32,329 --> 02:42:32,729
Okay.

1997
02:42:37,500 --> 02:42:38,600
Get you closer.

1998
02:42:39,889 --> 02:42:40,290
Right here.

1999
02:42:42,379 --> 02:42:42,979
No, back here.

2000
02:42:43,180 --> 02:42:43,479
Get...

2001
02:42:44,739 --> 02:42:45,639
Will you get back here?

2002
02:42:45,639 --> 02:42:46,139
Jesus.

2003
02:42:46,239 --> 02:42:46,940
What are you doing?

2004
02:42:49,370 --> 02:42:49,670
Okay.

2005
02:42:59,370 --> 02:43:03,090
Hello and welcome everybody to VR news.

2006
02:43:03,489 --> 02:43:07,290
I'm LD and welcome to the show.

2007
02:43:07,989 --> 02:43:09,090
First up on the news.

2008
02:43:09,790 --> 02:43:10,190
The se...

2009
02:43:10,190 --> 02:43:11,290
Hello!

2010
02:43:14,469 --> 02:43:14,969
Good again.

2011
02:43:17,340 --> 02:43:18,440
Welcome everybody.

2012
02:43:18,540 --> 02:43:19,239
Now that was bad.

2013
02:43:19,239 --> 02:43:22,000
That was too good.

2014
02:43:27,389 --> 02:43:30,290
Hello and welcome to VR news.

2015
02:43:30,590 --> 02:43:33,889
I'm LD and here is the top stories today.

2016
02:43:34,489 --> 02:43:40,780
Today, two more tech demos came out for VR and nobody fucking uses it.

2017
02:43:41,280 --> 02:43:45,280
Not one AAA developer has made anything for this platform.

2018
02:43:45,579 --> 02:43:51,079
So we're left to make our own fucking movies in this kind of little fun little show game.

2019
02:43:52,340 --> 02:43:53,040
That's bad too.

2020
02:43:54,040 --> 02:43:58,600
Welcome to VR news.

2021
02:43:58,899 --> 02:43:59,500
I'm LD.

2022
02:43:59,500 --> 02:44:00,899
I don't want to hear that one again.

2023
02:44:10,049 --> 02:44:10,450
Hey everybody.

2024
02:44:10,450 --> 02:44:11,450
Welcome to the show here.

2025
02:44:11,649 --> 02:44:13,549
As you can tell, we're on IGN.com.

2026
02:44:13,649 --> 02:44:14,350
No, don't do that.

2027
02:44:14,350 --> 02:44:15,049
That's bad too.

2028
02:44:15,250 --> 02:44:16,149
Don't fucking say that.

2029
02:44:16,950 --> 02:44:18,629
Don't do that one.

2030
02:44:19,129 --> 02:44:23,510
I mean, I was going to do a thing where it's like playing on the GameStop TVs.

2031
02:44:23,510 --> 02:44:23,909
No, no, no, no.

2032
02:44:23,909 --> 02:44:24,510
I'm not doing that.

2033
02:44:25,709 --> 02:44:36,899
Terrible winds have hit the coast of Las Vegas as we will hear from our weather report here from Dave the Dragon.

2034
02:44:36,899 --> 02:44:38,700
Dave the Dragon, how's the weather looking over there?

2035
02:44:51,979 --> 02:44:59,280
Terrible winds have hit the coast of Las Vegas as we will hear from our weather report here from Dave the Dragon.

2036
02:44:59,280 --> 02:45:00,879
Dave the Dragon, how's the weather looking over there?

2037
02:45:00,979 --> 02:45:04,379
Well, you see, if you can take a look over here, this is the moon.

2038
02:45:04,379 --> 02:45:08,280
This is not even Las Vegas, but the sun is going to come crashing down.

2039
02:45:08,280 --> 02:45:13,379
I mean, you're mentioning winds, but you're not mentioning the fact that Las Vegas is going to be wiped out by the meteor.

2040
02:45:13,479 --> 02:45:15,079
I bumped my hand on the table.

2041
02:45:15,280 --> 02:45:20,079
No, table, but that's the thing about the interdimensional fucking shit.

2042
02:45:20,079 --> 02:45:21,379
Oh my God.

2043
02:45:21,879 --> 02:45:22,579
This is bad.

2044
02:45:29,700 --> 02:45:31,600
I like, okay, let me tell you something.

2045
02:45:32,540 --> 02:45:37,540
I like lost my mojo spending 40 minutes troubleshooting the stream.

2046
02:45:53,639 --> 02:45:54,840
We were on fire too.

2047
02:45:54,840 --> 02:45:55,840
I can't even, whatever.

2048
02:45:56,040 --> 02:45:56,540
Here we go.

2049
02:45:56,540 --> 02:45:57,139
Ready for this one?

2050
02:46:03,200 --> 02:46:04,399
Fucking VR trouble.

2051
02:46:04,399 --> 02:46:06,000
I'll give you VR troubleshooting.

2052
02:46:06,000 --> 02:46:07,000
You want to hear this shit?

2053
02:46:07,299 --> 02:46:09,079
Hit the coast of Las Vegas.

2054
02:46:09,579 --> 02:46:10,280
No, no, no, no.

2055
02:46:10,280 --> 02:46:11,180
Delete the whole thing.

2056
02:46:11,579 --> 02:46:12,879
I got a better fucking idea for you.

2057
02:46:13,479 --> 02:46:44,770
All right, we're good.

2058
02:46:44,770 --> 02:46:45,170
Ready?

2059
02:46:45,610 --> 02:46:46,110
Here we go.

2060
02:46:53,600 --> 02:47:05,110
Hi, welcome to the news, the dragon news.

2061
02:47:05,209 --> 02:47:11,670
I'm Dragon Team Buford and today our top story is one that you're going to want to listen to.

2062
02:47:12,069 --> 02:47:15,069
First of all, World of Warcraft has been cancelled.

2063
02:47:15,469 --> 02:47:16,069
That's right.

2064
02:47:16,069 --> 02:47:20,569
Their subscriber numbers have dropped so much that they can't even keep anybody around.

2065
02:47:20,770 --> 02:47:26,069
They got WoW Classic coming up, but nobody's going to play that because WoW Classic wasn't even very fun.

2066
02:47:26,270 --> 02:47:28,870
Everybody thinks that it was fun, but we're going to...

2067
02:47:29,170 --> 02:47:30,270
No, you know what it is?

2068
02:47:30,469 --> 02:47:31,569
It's the fucking time limit.

2069
02:47:31,569 --> 02:47:32,069
Go back and...

2070
02:47:33,770 --> 02:47:35,170
I got to do the lab shit.

2071
02:47:35,170 --> 02:47:35,870
Get me out of here.

2072
02:47:36,979 --> 02:47:38,780
I'm like up against like a 20 second clock.

2073
02:47:38,780 --> 02:47:39,180
Get the...

2074
02:47:42,680 --> 02:47:42,979
There.

2075
02:47:43,180 --> 02:47:45,280
Now I don't have to worry about like a 10 second time limit.

2076
02:47:47,000 --> 02:47:47,799
This one will be good.

2077
02:47:50,799 --> 02:47:52,000
I've like lost it.

2078
02:47:52,200 --> 02:47:53,799
Oh my comedy is gone.

2079
02:47:53,799 --> 02:47:55,899
I got nothing funny left in my body.

2080
02:47:58,590 --> 02:47:59,790
Check this, it's even worse.

2081
02:48:00,790 --> 02:48:01,489
Dragon over here.

2082
02:48:01,790 --> 02:48:02,889
It's 45 minutes.

2083
02:48:02,989 --> 02:48:03,389
What happened?

2084
02:48:04,190 --> 02:48:05,290
Zoom in on that with my brain.

2085
02:48:06,389 --> 02:48:07,690
Sorry, it's sinking.

2086
02:48:07,690 --> 02:48:08,190
Let me...

2087
02:48:08,690 --> 02:48:09,389
Move that over here.

2088
02:48:09,389 --> 02:48:10,090
Oh, what's your problem?

2089
02:48:10,090 --> 02:48:10,489
Let me...

2090
02:48:11,190 --> 02:48:12,190
Google.com

2091
02:48:12,190 --> 02:48:13,290
www.google.

2092
02:48:13,290 --> 02:48:13,790
What is it?

2093
02:48:13,790 --> 02:48:16,190
Oh, I'm having a problem with my sinking issue if I straight...

2094
02:48:28,979 --> 02:48:54,329
I like it.

2095
02:49:02,350 --> 02:49:07,670
Alright, alright, alright.

2096
02:49:07,670 --> 02:49:09,170
I want a good clean five from you two.

2097
02:49:09,370 --> 02:49:11,260
Thousands watching at home.

2098
02:49:11,459 --> 02:49:12,469
Are you ready?

2099
02:49:12,770 --> 02:49:13,840
Are you ready?

2100
02:49:14,409 --> 02:49:15,409
Let's get it on, gentlemen.

2101
02:49:15,709 --> 02:49:17,129
But don't touch me.

2102
02:49:17,129 --> 02:49:17,729
Don't hurt me.

2103
02:49:17,829 --> 02:49:18,729
I'm just the judge.

2104
02:49:18,729 --> 02:49:19,729
I'm the judge.

2105
02:49:20,030 --> 02:49:24,000
Oh, that looked like it hurt.

Oh, that looked like it hurt.

02:49:28,889 --> 02:49:29,690
Are you okay?

2108
02:49:30,899 --> 02:49:31,899
Can you still go on?

2109
02:49:31,899 --> 02:49:32,600
Are you sure?

2110
02:49:35,379 --> 02:49:36,379
Okay, you know, he's fine.

02:50:04,559 --> 02:50:05,159
Alright, that's it.

2118
02:50:05,159 --> 02:50:05,659
He's dead.

2119
02:50:18,040 --> 02:50:25,569
Yeah, I want a good clean five from you two.

2120

Look, that looked like it hurt.

02:50:45,469 --> 02:50:46,270
Are you okay?

2133
02:50:47,459 --> 02:50:48,360
Can you still go on?

2134
02:50:48,360 --> 02:50:49,059

Nice.

You bet.

2144
02:51:14,200 --> 02:51:15,100
Stop doing that.

Stop, stop, stop.

2151
02:51:30,280 --> 02:51:30,780
Wait, wait, wait.

2152
02:51:31,379 --> 02:51:31,979
I'm not ready.

2153
02:51:32,280 --> 02:51:32,979

Alright, alright, alright.

2155

I want a good clean five from you two.

02:51:46,750 --> 02:51:47,450
Let's go back.

2168
02:51:47,750 --> 02:51:48,549
I gotta be closer.

2169
02:52:01,979 --> 02:52:02,379
Hello?

2170
02:52:08,780 --> 02:52:09,180

Alright, that's close enough.

2173
02:52:29,750 --> 02:52:30,250
Right, I think.

2174
02:52:36,379 --> 02:52:36,979

02:52:58,290 --> 02:52:58,889
Are you okay?

2189
02:53:00,159 --> 02:53:01,059
Can you still go on?

Are you sure?

2191
02:53:01,959 --> 02:53:02,659

02:54:05,899 --> 02:54:06,799
I'm just the judge.

Stop doing that.

2234
02:54:48,209 --> 02:54:49,610
I'm the best fruit in business.

2235
02:54:52,500 --> 02:54:59,719
Alright, let's get it on.

2236
02:55:00,319 --> 02:55:03,159
That was dog shit.

2237
02:55:18,200 --> 02:55:19,200
That was so bad.

2238
02:55:19,200 --> 02:55:20,600
That was worse than anything.

2239
02:55:21,100 --> 02:55:23,399
I've never made a piece of media that was that bad.

2240
02:55:23,899 --> 02:55:24,600
I don't think ever.

2241
02:55:25,000 --> 02:55:41,049
I'm going to puke.

2242
02:55:42,139 --> 02:55:43,139
I'm going to puke.

2243
02:55:46,540 --> 02:55:52,909
Oh, I just like hurt my back.

2244
02:55:53,920 --> 02:55:56,620
Oh, that hurt me so bad.

2245
02:55:57,420 --> 02:56:01,120
That's 4,000 fucking people just watched like the worst thing

2246
02:56:01,120 --> 02:56:02,420
I've ever fucking made.

2247
02:56:10,469 --> 02:56:11,370
I almost threw up on straight.

2248
02:56:11,370 --> 02:56:12,069
That would have been banned.

2249
02:56:12,770 --> 02:56:14,569
I would have seen you guys in like fucking four days.

2250
02:56:16,850 --> 02:56:18,350
You really want me to film this one?

2251
02:56:18,649 --> 02:56:19,549
Why are we in the?

2252
02:56:19,549 --> 02:56:20,649
Where are we?

2253
02:56:20,750 --> 02:56:21,850
Why are we out in the open?

2254
02:56:21,850 --> 02:56:22,950
There's no reason for this.

2255
02:56:23,750 --> 02:56:24,549
It's not even a ring.

2256
02:56:24,549 --> 02:56:25,750
It's just like a pasture.

2257
02:56:31,010 --> 02:56:32,709
That really did hurt so bad.

2258
02:56:33,829 --> 02:56:34,729
I like rib cage.

2259
02:56:34,729 --> 02:56:35,829
I like pulled my ribs.

2260
02:56:35,829 --> 02:56:36,629
Can you do that?

2261
02:56:39,010 --> 02:56:41,809
I didn't think it was even possible to pull your ribs, but I did.

2262
02:56:45,659 --> 02:56:47,260
Jesus fucking Christ.

2263
02:56:52,840 --> 02:56:53,440
This hurts.

2264
02:56:54,280 --> 02:56:55,079
God damn it.

2265
02:57:00,840 --> 02:57:01,440
Alright, alright, alright.

02:57:04,780 --> 02:57:05,979
Thousands watching at home.

2268

Don't touch me.

2275
02:57:24,459 --> 02:57:24,959
Don't hurt me.

2276
02:57:25,159 --> 02:57:26,059
I'm just gonna jump.

2277
02:57:26,360 --> 02:57:26,959
I'm the judge.

2278
02:57:27,899 --> 02:57:29,799
We're gonna get some fucking crazy angles here.

2279
02:57:29,799 --> 02:57:30,700
Ready for this shit?

2280
02:57:31,200 --> 02:57:32,799
They're even like taking five.

2281
02:57:33,200 --> 02:57:34,000
Watch this.

2282
02:57:46,360 --> 02:57:53,850
Like it hurt.

2283
02:57:53,950 --> 02:57:54,649
Are you okay?

2284
02:57:55,879 --> 02:57:56,780
Can you still go on?

2285
02:57:56,780 --> 02:57:57,479
Are you sure?

2286
02:57:57,780 --> 02:58:07,040

Alright, alright, alright.

2298
02:59:14,809 --> 02:59:16,110
Thousands watching at home.

2300
02:59:18,010 --> 02:59:18,209

I'm just gonna jump.

2308
02:59:24,010 --> 02:59:24,610
I'm the judge.

2309
02:59:31,370 --> 02:59:32,170
Looks like it hurt.

2310
02:59:33,819 --> 02:59:34,520
Are you okay?

2311
02:59:35,690 --> 02:59:36,690

2320
02:59:46,420 --> 02:59:47,319
Let's get it on, gentlemen.

2321
02:59:47,420 --> 02:59:47,920
Stop.

2322
02:59:54,829 --> 02:59:55,629
Fell asleep.

2323
03:00:02,780 --> 03:00:03,680
Stop doing that.

2324
03:00:04,180 --> 03:00:05,180

03:00:05,180 --> 03:00:06,379
Are you ready?

2326
03:00:09,440 --> 03:00:09,840
Alright.

2327
03:00:16,459 --> 03:00:17,659
I don't even want to fucking see it.

2328
03:00:24,520 --> 03:00:25,620
Oh my fucking God.

2329
03:00:25,920 --> 03:00:26,819
I don't even want to look at it.

2330
03:00:27,420 --> 03:00:28,319
I thought I'd let it render.

2331
03:00:30,200 --> 03:00:31,000
What's going on here?

2332
03:00:52,299 --> 03:00:53,500
I'm embarrassed for you.

2333
03:00:53,500 --> 03:00:54,100
You should be.

2334
03:00:54,799 --> 03:00:56,500
I'm embarrassed for me and it's me.

2335
03:01:09,340 --> 03:01:10,239
Tweet this?

2336
03:01:10,739 --> 03:01:11,340
No.

2337
03:01:12,379 --> 03:01:12,979
No way.

2338
03:01:17,090 --> 03:01:18,489
Not in a fucking million years.

2339
03:01:21,549 --> 03:01:22,649
Do it or no balls.

2340
03:01:22,649 --> 03:01:23,950
You want me to tweet this video?

2341
03:01:30,510 --> 03:01:31,209
Okay, fine.

2342
03:01:31,690 --> 03:01:32,090
Fuck it.

2343
03:01:34,299 --> 03:01:35,100
I can't.

2344
03:01:35,100 --> 03:01:37,200
I've got to like connect my Twitter to this app.

2345
03:01:37,500 --> 03:01:53,659
I can't.

2346
03:01:53,659 --> 03:01:54,360
I don't.

2347
03:01:54,360 --> 03:01:55,159
I got to like link.

2348
03:01:55,159 --> 03:01:56,459
I don't even have my Twitter password.

2349
03:02:05,719 --> 03:02:07,819
I don't even know my password.

2350
03:02:13,389 --> 03:02:14,889
What if I videotape it and film it?

2351
03:02:14,889 --> 03:02:15,889
No, it's not going to work.

2352
03:02:23,079 --> 03:02:23,979
I have no idea.

2353
03:02:28,819 --> 03:02:29,620
I'll do it later.

2354
03:02:30,219 --> 03:02:33,420
I will upload this video with no context, no message, nothing.

2355
03:02:34,559 --> 03:02:35,159
Guys, okay.

2356
03:02:35,159 --> 03:02:35,860
Let me tell you something.

2357
03:02:36,260 --> 03:02:37,959
I haven't tweeted since February.

2358
03:02:38,159 --> 03:02:38,559
Okay?

2359
03:02:39,260 --> 03:02:41,860
Do you really think I give a shit about my Twitter account?

2360
03:02:42,559 --> 03:02:45,559
I haven't done a real tweet since like February 13th.

2361
03:02:48,530 --> 03:02:49,729
This is fine to me.

2362
03:02:57,930 --> 03:02:58,329
I'll do it.

2363
03:02:58,329 --> 03:02:58,629
I will.

2364
03:02:58,629 --> 03:02:59,129
I promise.

2365
03:03:00,200 --> 03:03:01,500
I did a tweet three hours ago.

2366
03:03:01,500 --> 03:03:02,200
No, no, no, no, no, no.

2367
03:03:04,079 --> 03:03:05,979
There's a difference between tweeting out your stream and

2368
03:03:05,979 --> 03:03:07,280
making like an actual tweet.

2369
03:03:08,920 --> 03:03:09,319
All right.

2370
03:03:09,920 --> 03:03:10,920
Let's get a good one here.

2371
03:03:11,219 --> 03:03:12,319
I want something elaborate.

2372
03:03:13,360 --> 03:03:14,159
Let's do like a dinner.

2373
03:03:26,549 --> 03:03:27,250
Are we still good?

2374
03:03:36,860 --> 03:03:37,860
Let me give you guys some of these.

2375
03:04:17,959 --> 03:04:19,659
Let me give you guys something to work with here.

2376
03:04:19,760 --> 03:04:20,059
Ready?

2377
03:04:35,469 --> 03:04:37,469

Isn't that funny?

2380
03:04:53,180 --> 03:04:53,780

Okay, I'm real.

2389
03:05:21,129 --> 03:05:21,829

That's it.

2391
03:05:37,399 --> 03:05:38,100

2392
03:05:38,100 --> 03:05:38,700

It's me, Jerma, by the way.

2397
03:06:02,790 --> 03:06:03,389
That's an alien.

2398
03:06:04,360 --> 03:06:04,860
Isn't that funny?

2399
03:06:17,049 --> 03:06:17,549
No, please.

2400
03:06:17,649 --> 03:06:18,450
Please don't do it.

2401
03:06:18,649 --> 03:06:19,450

not sure if saving them is it and then doing it off stream is a good

2459
03:21:39,889 --> 03:21:51,709
idea because it seems like it seems like you only get this one instance

2460
03:21:51,829 --> 03:22:03,059
of the scene am I correct on that just watch yeah that's true I could just watch

2461
03:22:03,059 --> 03:22:04,899
it but that we had a problem with that before too

2462
03:22:04,899 --> 03:22:10,579
remember I tried to play the last one you just wouldn't play it was skipping

2463
03:22:10,579 --> 03:22:15,979
all over the place all right I'm gonna fit it we're gonna do part two I'm

gonna finish this up dad's gonna see how fast they can eat and that

2465
03:22:22,010 --> 03:22:36,000
determines where the favorite child is is it's storming that's in the game

2466
03:22:36,440 --> 03:22:54,450
that's not outside here no it's not storming yeah where's the jazz this

2467
03:22:54,450 --> 03:23:43,260
feels really out of place all right the next thing I'm gonna do is singing I'm

2468
03:23:43,260 --> 03:23:48,370
gonna try to sing like six or seven people any particular songs if you'd

2512
03:47:22,579 --> 03:47:38,049

2514
03:48:06,329 --> 03:48:15,639

2515
03:48:15,639 --> 03:48:28,950
needed to see it play out it's probably the labs mode yeah it's probably a shit oh well well

2516
03:48:28,950 --> 03:48:34,860
what's there is really really really fucking fun I think we're just using the experimental

2517
03:48:34,860 --> 03:48:44,420
mode too much but unfortunately we're gonna have to move on let's watch the videos we made

2518
03:48:44,420 --> 03:48:52,350
listen to VR Josh what did we are just saying look into the beta build called mind show unleashed

2519
03:48:52,350 --> 03:49:10,959
it might be more stable oh you know I'll give it a mind show unleashed is the beta more stable

2520
03:49:10,959 --> 03:49:24,690
that does not sound more stable the beta had a fix for that we'll come back to it how does

unfortunate technical issues can plague ABC you know it's probably a good thing let's be real

2523
03:49:46,059 --> 03:49:52,969

450 viewers so we're gonna move on I'd like I wanted to see that come to fruition though
