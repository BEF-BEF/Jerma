1
00:00:02,419 --> 00:00:07,049
Hey, what's up? Sorry, I'm late. I had to come up with a funny title.

2
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:15,339
I'm sitting here going, I gotta think of a funny title. And I came up with one. I came up with one.

3
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:25,859
You think it's kind of funny? Okay, 15 minutes. Yeah, I've got to come up with a title.

4
00:00:26,579 --> 00:00:48,570
I thought it was VR Josh. Nah, nah, nah, nah. Yeah, it was. What the hell is going on right now?

5
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:55,109
What is this? Why is there a purple box over people's messages? What is this?

6
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:11,159
First time chat. What is this? I don't want this. How do I delete this? Immediately. I want to delete

7
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:21,849
this immediately. Are the edibles kicking in? No, dude. All right, fucking stop. Since I turned 37,

8
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:28,549
it's been nothing but weirdo streams. I have to stop being weird. I'm going to say I'm going to be

9
00:01:28,549 --> 00:01:38,629
fucking quiet for the next hour. But no, it's a new chat appearance.

10
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:44,439
Why do you sound like you don't like the real German? Well, it's because I'm a little winded

11
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:54,439
because I was running around the house. I was okay. You know that you're late for something

12
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:59,480
when you start taking corners in your own place. You don't know you understand that.

13
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:18,020
But I'm taking corners. I had to get my tea. My tea wasn't even ready. Why were you running?

14
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:32,810
I'll be fine. Just give me a minute. You made us weird. Sad. What? Don't you guys understand

15
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:39,819
that? You come observe me. You don't want to be like me. Come observe me. Be like,

16
00:02:39,819 --> 00:02:59,750
I don't want to be like that guy. I'm going to do good in school. Observe. How are you? I'm

17
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:06,250
doing good. I'm doing good. Sorry we delayed a couple of days, but you know what happened.

18
00:03:10,979 --> 00:03:15,699
Actually, we should go over this because it's important. So today we're going to stream here.

19
00:03:15,699 --> 00:03:24,409
Listen, we're going to do Splatoon three. And then after that, Breath of the Wild.

20
00:03:27,699 --> 00:03:41,860
And then on Sunday, we'll take a break from the switch. Why did you delay? I woke up on

21
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:47,879
the wrong side of the bed the last couple of days and I was like, nah, I just take care of

22
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:53,669
a few things too. All right. I literally ran around. Can I just let me just not be winded

23
00:03:53,669 --> 00:04:01,500
for one second. Listen to this voice. What's going on? No, I had to. There were some things

24
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:11,639
I had to take care of. What is going on with my voice? I promise you it was not like this

25
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:21,990
five minutes ago. So what's the story Sunday? I don't know. I want to get away from the switch

26
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:32,889
for a little bit though. Is it allergy season? It actually might be. Did you hear that? I just fake

27
00:04:32,889 --> 00:04:41,509
sniffed. You just implanted that in my head. Did you hear that? I hope you did. Did that come

28
00:04:41,509 --> 00:04:55,829
through? I was like, oh, you know, maybe, maybe, um, he's allergic to streaming now. All right.

29
00:04:55,829 --> 00:05:10,629
Yeah. We're going to play Splatoon three. Let me tweet though. That's good. Okay. Um, I

30
00:05:11,509 --> 00:05:17,209
don't really know how to play Splatoon. It started with motion controls and I turned that off.

31
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:28,980
I did the tutorial and I made my squid here. Look, I'll just show you whatever.

32
00:05:37,019 --> 00:05:45,980
Apparently this you can make different. Um, hold on. Can you guys hear it? There we are.

33
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:50,779
I don't, I don't know. I don't know how any of this works. This is, this is my character

34
00:05:51,500 --> 00:06:13,990
and this is, uh, are these players? Are they? They are. Okay. How's that? Wait. So this,

35
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:36,329
this is a player right here. Why, why are they NPCs? It's not in real time. Uh, okay. Okay.

36
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:44,600
All right. So, so where do I go? I took them. I took off. I don't want to do motion controls.

37
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:54,139
I don't want to do it. I'll be okay. Let me be very, very upfront with everybody. Um,

38
00:06:54,779 --> 00:07:02,009
I installed Splatoon three and made this character and then never opened it again.

39
00:07:02,649 --> 00:07:08,360
God, it's, it's had to have been at least three weeks. It's had to have been at least two weeks,

40
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:18,040
at least I don't, I have no idea. All right. Go to the menu. Lobby stages. Oh, okay. Regular

41
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:39,910
battle. Anarchy battle. What's salmon run? Turn on drawings. You coward story mode to salmon run.

42
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:48,389
Yes. Yes. Yes. How do I do this? I should do this right now. No, this is definitely like

43
00:07:48,389 --> 00:07:58,680
hard mode. I'm not doing hard mode right now. All right. Let's just do lobby. How do we look

44
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:09,459
plastic today? I'm, I mean, I don't feel plastic. Welcome to the lobby. It's your portal to online

45
00:08:09,459 --> 00:08:15,050
battles and where you stash all your gear. As you splat forth and online battles, you'll level up

46
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:22,629
and earn cash. Why level up and get cash? So you can access a gear and some battle modes are

47
00:08:22,629 --> 00:08:30,970
restricted to players at a higher level. Okay. Why don't you check out the battle pot? Okay.

48
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:41,960
Less chat, more splat. That's what I mean. Oh, when you play online, your nickname and player

49
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:57,960
data may be made public. All right. That's about this way. Okay. That's those taunts. Listen,

50
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:01,879
let me just do a regular fight. I'm going to be the literally bottom, uh, bragging person,

51
00:09:01,879 --> 00:09:16,759
but that's fine. Okay. Bro, what's your haircut? Uh, the haircut is a 37 year old man that has not

52
00:09:16,759 --> 00:09:24,500
been to the hair salon in two and a half months. That's it. And sometimes shaves, sometimes shaves.

53
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:42,870
All right, let's go. Both headphones in. Which one is me? You, that's me. I don't know how to play.

54
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:51,450
I actually don't know how to play. Is there a sprint? Okay. That's how do I, how do I, um,

55
00:09:51,450 --> 00:10:03,769
how do you do the squid move when you jump in the, in the squidding? Oh yeah. First frag.

56
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:33,080
Do I have to like paint the ground? What? Well, you can hide. Okay. All right.

57
00:10:33,639 --> 00:11:12,620
There's different weapon loadouts too. What's that? Oh, grenade. I think I'm doing okay. Am I

58
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:18,840
doing good? Is that a player? Who is that? All right. Shoot the ink, the ground, shoot the ground,

59
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:51,559
shoot the ground. Okay. Shoot the ground. I mean, the whole ground is green. What's up? What the

60
00:11:51,559 --> 00:12:32,539
fuck is this crab? What the hell is that? Should I pick this up? What the fuck was that? Oh, is there

61
00:12:32,539 --> 00:12:42,440
a healer? How do I check the stats? Press right stick. That was actually kind of fun.

62
00:12:44,019 --> 00:12:53,940
That was actually pretty fun. I enjoyed that. That was fun. All right. So we lost. What happened?

63
00:12:53,940 --> 00:13:08,460
That's the first time I've ever played the game. So it's only based on what's on the ground. That's

64
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:20,950
it. It was basically a three v four. Okay. In that mode. All right. That's what battles are like.

65
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:25,269
Hey, did you happen to notice how some of your opponents had cool looking name displays?

66
00:13:26,009 --> 00:13:29,850
They're called splash tags and they're fully customizable to show off your personality.

67
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:36,659
Wait, you haven't even set up a nickname for your splash tag yet. You got to show up in style to

68
00:13:36,659 --> 00:13:46,789
your next battle. What do you want to call yourself? Yeah, we'll see. I want it to be a reveal.

69
00:13:46,789 --> 00:14:21,799
I don't want you guys to see it. What should I call myself? What's the objective? That's so bad.

70
00:14:21,799 --> 00:14:34,860
That's the worst nickname I've ever seen. Is this permanent? Is it permanent or? All right. Hold on.

71
00:14:37,289 --> 00:14:44,090
No. Okay. Okay. That's all right. You know, you can use the Sheldon license you got on shiny new

72
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:58,950
weapons. I can't wait to see what I did. Ammo Knights. Okay. Swap. Okay. Cool. So the whole

73
00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:04,789
goal of Splatoon is you want to get more paint on the ground. Oh, this is cool. What's the range on

74
00:15:04,789 --> 00:15:12,940
this shit? Let me hold on. Let me see something. All right. So this is a massive arc. So you

75
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:23,000
realistically need to be really close. LZ makes you fly around. That's also how you get more ink.

76
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:35,620
Right. Get a new weapon. Try the charger. All right. How do I? That's not my name. My name's

77
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:40,980
not Splattershot Jr. I know a lot of people before I think that. How do I buy a new weapon?

78
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:55,059
Let's go to the ammo shop, right? Grab a bite. Hello there. Welcome. This is your first time

79
00:15:55,059 --> 00:16:10,539
here, isn't it? How splendid. I do hope you become a regular here at the Crab and Go. This voice is

80
00:16:10,539 --> 00:16:21,610
stun locking me. I can't even think. What did it say? Crab? Crab sandwich. Battle? Okay. So this is

81
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:27,590
probably cost real money or something. It's like gumballs too. All right. So let me hold on.

82
00:16:28,899 --> 00:16:31,779
You think it's to try a new weapon? Do I have enough money? Let me try. Let me do another match.

83
00:16:31,779 --> 00:16:41,559
Let me just get a feel for the game. Just regular battle. The story mode. I know. I will. I get all

84
00:16:41,559 --> 00:16:53,990
day. What does it menu? Then ammo shop. All right. Well, hold on. Let me just play one more time.

85
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:15,079
I could be a bot. Try act like a bot. Just walk around like a World of Warcraft NPC.

86
00:17:16,039 --> 00:17:34,920
All right. No, no, no, no, no. We're playing to win. What the hell was that? We just got hit

87
00:17:34,920 --> 00:18:07,130
by a hammer. X is the map. Oh, shit. All right. Cool. Over the gank. Got it. Get that shit out of

88
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:40,779
here. Oh, shit. Right stick. Right stick. What does the right stick do? We're winning. Wait,

89
00:18:40,779 --> 00:19:00,039
we got, we got, we're good. Right stick. Right stick has moved my camera, man. Sorry. R3. That's

90
00:19:00,039 --> 00:19:19,660
what I'm... It doesn't do anything. Oh, bullshit. Press right stick when you have a special. Top

91
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:56,809
right is special. All right. Right stick. Here we go. Ready? What's it do? What does it do?

92
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:15,369
Come on. We get it. We're doing all right. It's a shield. We had to have won that one, right?

93
00:20:18,279 --> 00:20:30,119
Yeah. 26 point. 40 point. What does that mean? We lost by 1%. All right. I want that roller. How

94
00:20:30,119 --> 00:20:43,460
do I get that? I want the huge roller. It's a shield. All right. Turn motion controls on. I would,

95
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:58,140
I will throw up into my shirt if I do that. See, let's get it. I did fine. All right. So menu.

96
00:21:02,069 --> 00:21:30,839
Weapons. I want the roller. Okay. Yeah. I didn't read any of that. All right. You get Sheldon

97
00:21:30,839 --> 00:21:40,970
license by battling and leveling up or even just developing your skills by... All right. So I want

98
00:21:40,970 --> 00:22:16,329
the roller. The splatter shot. This is actually locking up my head. Okay. So the Tri-Zuko. That's

99
00:22:16,329 --> 00:22:27,990
what I want. I'm going to fucking destroy people with this thing. Ling ink or hold ZR. Curling bombs.

100
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:39,180
All right. No, don't buy that. I just want to skip the fucking lore. All right. I want this.

101
00:22:49,910 --> 00:23:02,140
This looks fun. You can test it out. I feel like I'm playing as a... I feel like I have like a

102
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:15,299
dragon great sword in Dark Souls. Yeah. Oh, this thing's amazing. I feel like you can just get

103
00:23:15,299 --> 00:23:19,660
killed really easily here though. All right. What does this, what does this do? Oh, you should

104
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:30,039
shoot it like a Roomba. Oh, all right. So that's, that's right bumper. What does left bumper do?

105
00:23:30,039 --> 00:23:40,329
Anything? No. I guess. Holy shit. Is this the strategy? Isn't it? This is probably the strat.

106
00:23:42,890 --> 00:24:06,539
That's the strat. Whoa. It is a dragon great sword. That's how you start every single fight.

107
00:24:06,539 --> 00:24:20,250
All right. Jump special. And what does this thing do? This is just a shield. Okay. Let me try the

108
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:30,650
other thing too. How do I get out of here? My game's bugged. My game's bugged. I can't leave.

109
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:44,500
My game's bugged. Let's try this. So how does this one work? Okay. I could, this definitely needs

110
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:49,980
motion controls. Otherwise you end up doing the thing where you play every console FPS,

111
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:59,180
where you go like this. The target's right there. I'd like to shoot that person. Not happening.

112
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:14,299
It's a cool weapon though. I like the grenade better. Try out the gyro controls with it. Let

113
00:25:14,299 --> 00:25:24,440
me see. I don't think I can do it right now. Can I test anything else? Oh, I can. What's this thing?

114
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:43,859
This thing kind of sucks. That range is awful. Is this supposed to be like a shotgun? Actually,

115
00:25:44,420 --> 00:26:07,859
nevermind. This is cool. It's in the other settings. Okay. Let me try this. Bro,

116
00:26:07,859 --> 00:26:19,210
no fucking way. How does anybody do this? I feel like when a 70 year old lady, a 70 year old woman

117
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:23,210
was handed a Wiimote for the first time and she'd never play a game before in her entire life.

118
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:36,519
That's how this feels to me. How do you turn? Oh no, no, no. It's not, this is fine, right?

119
00:26:36,519 --> 00:26:43,099
Up and down vertical is fine, but it's the going side to side and having the right stick too.

120
00:26:43,099 --> 00:27:08,390
This is no way this isn't going to happen. Actually, hold on a minute. Actually. So should

121
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:28,329
I be using the right stick at all? Press Y to reset. Oh, it's weird. Let me try the sniper with

122
00:27:28,329 --> 00:27:51,539
this. I mean, it's way better, but like it sucks at the same time. It's still weird though. It's

123
00:27:51,539 --> 00:28:06,259
the side to side motion that's still fucking me up. Be the worst sniper ever. Change the sensitivity

124
00:28:06,259 --> 00:28:28,920
on it. I just tried to do it with the, okay, sensitivity higher. I mean, it's better for aiming,

125
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:40,819
but it still makes me want to puke. Lower is easier to get used to. I changed it. That's good.

126
00:28:40,819 --> 00:28:46,140
Look, sensitivity and motion. I did it. I, this was down here. I put it up. This was the controller

127
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:51,049
sensitivity. I don't want that to be high. This is where I wanted it. I'll try it like this. All

128
00:28:51,049 --> 00:28:57,180
right. I'm going to try the sniper. I'm going to try it with motion controls. No, I like it high.

129
00:28:57,180 --> 00:29:14,140
Are you going to handheld? No, but wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. If I'm just going to be,

130
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:23,900
if I'm going to be Roller Andy, then why would I even care? Let me be, let me go back to,

131
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:33,369
hold on, because this isn't going to be, I don't like this. No, no way. Yeah. I'll try that later.

132
00:29:33,369 --> 00:29:44,809
This makes way more sense in my brain. Let me just get used to the game like this. Okay, leave.

133
00:29:44,809 --> 00:30:13,539
Okay. All right. Let me get it. So I got a roller. I'm ready. Roller main. I mean, yeah. Maybe a

134
00:30:13,539 --> 00:30:28,490
little. Okay. So this is cool. Let's go to the lobby. Split joy cons are actually better for

135
00:30:28,490 --> 00:31:05,779
this game. Really? What's this? Get advice. Is it a cat? No. Oh, here we go. I'm going to top frag

136
00:31:05,779 --> 00:31:25,740
now. Motion controls are better. Yeah. Maybe this is my third game ever on Splatoon. I've played as

137
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:35,990
many games in Splatoon as there have been releases of this series. So let me get used to the game.

138
00:31:36,069 --> 00:32:04,329
Go. This is my job, right? Oh yeah. We're going to do dual coats. That's right.

139
00:32:05,609 --> 00:32:49,049
What happened here? I'm going to make sure we're covered. Every little percent counts.

140
00:32:49,049 --> 00:33:00,710
You've seen it every time we've played. Does that mean that somebody died there

141
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:53,849
on my team? Sorry. I was tank. Come on. They wiped us out. I have a special. You're right.

142
00:33:53,849 --> 00:34:00,069
Fuck. I keep forgetting. How do I die there? What do you mean just happened?

143
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:40,219
Out of ink. What? That's going to be the game changer right there.

144
00:34:44,019 --> 00:34:55,210
Nevermind. We lost by a lot. Holy shit. We got destroyed. Learn how to spawn on your teammates.

145
00:34:55,210 --> 00:35:07,860
How do you do that? This was a three V four. It was. That's not fair. Press X when you respawn.

146
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:18,840
I like the roller. Oh, somebody DC'd. All right. That makes sense. The arrow thing was a teammate

147
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:39,289
jumping to you. Oh, okay. Rollers are fun. You know, I wrote this game off and thought it was dumb.

148
00:35:39,289 --> 00:35:52,949
That's my mistake for like the last five years. Splatoon one came out. I was like, nah,

149
00:35:52,949 --> 00:36:00,059
Splatoon two. Didn't even know it released. Splatoon three. Where have I been all this time?

150
00:36:00,699 --> 00:36:05,510
What was I doing? Oh, it's because I was on the Wii U and that was an unbelievably awful experience.

151
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:15,539
Now I remember. I wrote the whole series off because the Wii U existed. All right,

152
00:36:15,539 --> 00:36:23,929
I'll get this. We go. I helped. I'll get this corner. I get this corner. You get that one.

153
00:36:24,570 --> 00:36:38,650
Somebody ulting. You're going to be real disappointed when you realize that I was

154
00:36:38,650 --> 00:36:46,230
back here cleaning up your mess. That felt like an ad. That felt like I was on TV doing an ad.

155
00:36:57,159 --> 00:37:42,119
I got it. No, I didn't. And then right after. Splatoon three. Coming soon. Yeah. All right.

156
00:37:42,119 --> 00:38:03,510
How do I spawn on teammates? Is it X? Oh, shit. Okay. Like that. It worked. Why can't I jump up here?

157
00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:47,780
I just got a fucking pentakill, I think. Am I doing all right? Oh, there's no way we're losing,

158
00:38:47,780 --> 00:39:15,500
right? I got a little bit. All right. I got it. There it is. You can jump to anybody at any time.

159
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:35,380
Really? That's cool. I can see your circle. I mean, my circle. Let's get it. And my eyes.

160
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:45,980
You can see my eyes. You can also jump back to spawn. Oh, yes. All right. Wait, wait, wait.

161
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:53,960
How does story mode work? How do I do this? Should I do one more? I have to piss so fucking bad.

162
00:39:53,960 --> 00:41:27,349
I'm sorry. It's been like 20 minutes. I'll be right back. Two seconds. Okay. I'm back. I've been.

163
00:41:27,349 --> 00:41:38,739
I've been just slamming fucking teas and water. Did you wash your hands? Of course I did. What

164
00:41:38,739 --> 00:41:47,059
do you mean? What happened to the BRB music? Yeah. I don't know why I got disconnected from

165
00:41:47,059 --> 00:41:54,809
my scream deck thing. I want to do one more. Can I do one? I'm going to do one more and then I will

166
00:41:55,530 --> 00:42:00,980
do some other stuff. Let me do one more. I'm just barely getting the hang of the game.

167
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:17,719
Talk to the cat. Fresh meter in the match. When you measure your performance,

168
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:22,489
when you win, the meter goes up. But if you lose a turf or battle, it drops.

169
00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:30,309
Meter also changes the color of the flag by each weapon. Use the fresh meter to see your personal

170
00:42:30,309 --> 00:42:44,699
records for each weapon. I mean, that's cool. Private battle. I don't think I could even do

171
00:42:44,699 --> 00:42:59,800
this yet. Turn on the gyro. No, not right now. I really don't like motion controls.

172
00:43:03,719 --> 00:43:11,960
So this the when I press in the right stick, it makes a shield around me. It's a big shield

173
00:43:11,960 --> 00:44:20,949
for the team. OK. Is there a double jump? Stop. Oh, fuck off. I thought I was going to go further

174
00:44:20,949 --> 00:44:28,579
than that. What's this? What's this fucking weapon this person has? What was that? What was that

175
00:44:28,579 --> 00:44:53,940
thing? Why don't I have what is this fucking hammer? Oh, we're in so much trouble here.

176
00:45:07,579 --> 00:46:15,079
What are these kill streaks like Call of Duty kill streaks landing on us?

177
00:46:15,079 --> 00:46:31,289
Where is this motherfucker? Holy shit. Use your ult. We didn't get to play the game.

178
00:46:31,289 --> 00:47:15,929
Can I move the ult indicator to like in the middle of the screen? I feel like I just don't

179
00:47:15,929 --> 00:47:23,940
know when this happens. I feel like I have to look at where the face cam is. When it fills up,

180
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:38,489
I want it to be like, whoa, your ult is ready. Can I mod the game to do that? Try a different

181
00:47:38,489 --> 00:47:53,670
weapon. I will. It already does do that. It does that. Your hair glows. Oh, shit. That's

182
00:47:53,670 --> 00:48:06,630
what that means. All right. Hold on. I thought I had like a buff from a teammate. All right.

183
00:48:06,630 --> 00:49:32,820
We're going to win this one. Group up on me. I thought it happened again. I was like, oh shit.

184
00:49:32,820 --> 00:49:36,099
All right. Well, I'm glad that happened in the very beginning and not at the very end.

185
00:49:41,420 --> 00:49:47,380
I started to understand the game. So as a roller, should I do what I'm doing? Is this

186
00:49:48,099 --> 00:49:52,179
am I helping? Is this what I should be doing? Don't go right to like the front lines. Just

187
00:49:52,179 --> 00:49:56,860
do some painting and shit, right? That's what I'm supposed to be doing, right?

188
00:50:00,099 --> 00:50:05,989
I mean, it makes sense that this is what I should be doing. Oh, this is my favorite song.

189
00:50:06,630 --> 00:50:10,820
Oh, you on the wall. You know the one, the lyrics that go like this.

190
00:50:11,699 --> 00:51:21,699
Can we not even kill the AFK player? Are you dropping here? I know what that means now.

191
00:51:50,789 --> 00:52:13,510
Why am I going to kill him in one hit? What? It's killing me in one hit.

192
00:52:38,010 --> 00:53:01,989
Oh, I got to go back to the other weapon. I'm switching. I'm switching weapons.

193
00:53:01,989 --> 00:53:28,949
Did I actually scream in your ears? I'm sorry. Give me the default. I feel like I was doing

194
00:53:28,949 --> 00:53:52,730
better with this. Buy a new one. I need another. I want one of those alts that drops a fucking bunch

195
00:53:52,730 --> 00:54:22,389
of grenades on everybody. Play to level four. Every weapon has a different loadout. The roller was,

196
00:54:22,389 --> 00:54:59,059
you know what I mean? Oh, let's go. Watch this. What the fuck was that?

197
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:50,920
Oh, what's that? What's that?

198
00:57:15,699 --> 00:57:31,940
I looked over thinking I was going to see like Omega Lulz and it's just all monkey ass.

199
00:57:35,579 --> 00:57:44,519
I was like, oh, they're going to think that's funny. It's like, holy shit. Everyone's like,

200
00:57:44,519 --> 00:58:07,940
what the fuck was that? This is what Splatoon will do to a motherfucker. All right. Hold on.

201
00:58:07,940 --> 00:58:28,280
One more. I had to go all in. I did it once and I'm like, all right, that song has that happened

202
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:34,969
twice. I got to go all in. That was a Tasmanian devil moment. I was like, I got to go all in.

203
00:58:42,809 --> 00:58:58,550
What song? That's what I, that's what I was doing. What are you talking about?

204
00:58:58,550 --> 00:59:09,610
That's not what it sounded like. It was, it didn't wait. You guys did not know. That's what I was.

205
00:59:09,610 --> 00:59:22,219
What? That makes it even funnier for me. That makes it way better. I'm so happy.

206
00:59:22,940 --> 01:00:08,860
Double shield. What's that mean? What's this mean? What's that thing mean? It sounded like

207
01:00:08,860 --> 01:00:37,019
Woody Woodpecker. No way. No way. I should have. I'm an idiot. What the hell was that?

208
01:00:37,579 --> 01:02:13,769
I need ink. Shit. Got it. Oh, come on, man. We may have lost. Yeah, we lost. By a lot.

209
01:02:16,230 --> 01:02:20,519
Somebody called me an idiot. For what? If you use your special, it refills your ink.

210
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:28,199
Fucking idiot. I didn't know that. Man, I'm learning how to play the game.

211
01:02:29,159 --> 01:02:41,190
I want to hear the Woody Woodpecker. Can I hear it? Do we have a clip? Hold on. I need to hear

212
01:02:41,190 --> 01:03:00,730
because I was doing the Splatoon theme song. Does anybody have a clip? Oh, is that not the

213
01:03:00,730 --> 01:03:15,019
theme song? I'm trying to understand how you don't know that. That's the Splatoon theme song. I was

214
01:03:15,019 --> 01:03:21,190
so accurate. That was like perfect. People saying, oh, that wasn't even close. Yes, it was.

215
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:34,179
God damn it. All right. I have to play one without the headphones on. Woody Woodpecker is

216
01:03:34,900 --> 01:04:02,900
a-ha-ha-ha. That was ha-ha-ha-ha. You got it wrong. It's coming up. The volume is coming out of my

217
01:04:02,900 --> 01:04:08,360
speakers here. All right. This is the one. And then I promise after this, I will stop and I

218
01:04:08,360 --> 01:04:45,769
will do story mode for at least 10 minutes. Good. Control the middle. Control mid. Make them way up.

219
01:05:10,260 --> 01:05:35,030
That was a pretty good life. It was all right. Oh my God. That was a fucking explosive.

220
01:05:49,940 --> 01:05:58,340
Too much going on. All right. We're actually starting to lose pretty bad now.

221
01:06:18,199 --> 01:06:46,519
Shit. Oh my God. My ultimate. I had it right at the end. All right. I got the yelp off.

222
01:06:46,519 --> 01:07:16,500
Just go, go, go, go. We only have 20 seconds. All right. All right. I mean, we got dominated,

223
01:07:16,500 --> 01:07:56,019
but that's fine. Oh my goodness. We didn't even play. You're actually so bad. Okay. I'm going to

224
01:07:56,019 --> 01:08:08,420
go to the store. I was number one on the team by almost twice. There are a few shops around here

225
01:08:08,420 --> 01:08:34,359
with gear. Okay. I have a store now. So what about head gear? I got 10 grand. We sell stuff

226
01:08:34,359 --> 01:08:49,369
that you wear on your head, you know, like hats. They've got gear abilities. Okay. Quick super jump.

227
01:08:49,369 --> 01:08:56,710
Run speed up. Come back. What's that? Boost some of your abilities for a short time after respawning.

228
01:08:57,270 --> 01:09:15,079
Quick respawn. All right. Well, this is why I didn't have any of these. Reduce damage taken

229
01:09:15,079 --> 01:09:22,439
and improves mobility when walking through enemy ink. That's actually pretty good. This is the only

230
01:09:23,239 --> 01:09:32,390
clothing. These are the only pieces of head gear you have. All right. I'm buying it.

231
01:09:32,390 --> 01:09:46,579
So I'm going to put the umpire mask on. Okay. I can unlock some stuff. The slosher. Oh, this is the

232
01:09:46,579 --> 01:10:13,739
pail of ink. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Dual welding pistol type weapons that let's be honest look

233
01:10:13,739 --> 01:10:25,640
pretty sweet. All right. That actually looks really cool. I want it. I have this dodge roll.

234
01:10:25,640 --> 01:10:30,699
All right. All right. All right. All right. Too much info. Too much info. Too much info. I'll

235
01:10:30,699 --> 01:10:42,180
just go play with it in the uh in like the platoon room. Sprinkler. Okay. Cool. Yep. All right.

236
01:10:42,180 --> 01:10:59,300
Okay. All right. I'm just gonna I'm gonna go play. Did any I went did one person um actually sit

237
01:10:59,300 --> 01:11:11,989
there and listen to that whole thing? All right. I want to try the slosher. So how does this work?

238
01:11:11,989 --> 01:11:28,869
Yeah. This thing's crazy. This thing can have. All right. So I gotta explain this to me. Why

239
01:11:28,869 --> 01:11:36,939
would you use the roller brush? This thing has more surface area. Just go like this. Actually,

240
01:11:36,939 --> 01:12:01,800
maybe not. Twister time. That's amazing. Different rolls for different weapons. Okay. I kind of like

241
01:12:01,800 --> 01:12:48,229
it. There's three twisters. Really? It's time to get used to the motion controls. Yeah. I don't like

242
01:12:48,229 --> 01:12:54,899
it but it's just way more effective. I'll actually be actually hitting things. All right. I want to

243
01:12:54,899 --> 01:13:10,329
try the other thing. I got dual pistols, right? It's kind of like the default weapon but better.

244
01:13:10,329 --> 01:13:48,779
Sticky. Oh, it's like a sticky bomb. They're good. B is dodge roll. B is jump. How do I do it? B while

245
01:13:48,779 --> 01:14:01,909
shooting. I mean this is incredible. All right. I'm thinking that's probably the best one I like

246
01:14:01,909 --> 01:14:24,630
so far. What about this? Big staff. This runs out of ink really fast. This is all about burst. You

247
01:14:24,630 --> 01:14:29,979
got a group up here. If there's a group. Let's say there's two or three people. You just go.

248
01:14:29,979 --> 01:14:40,619
That's what kept killing me before. Whoa. Yeah. Somebody would just walk up and go

249
01:14:40,619 --> 01:14:55,289
and three of us would die. All right. What's the uh. Okay. I have to sit back for this.

250
01:14:55,289 --> 01:15:15,880
For this to make any sense. Okay. I have to have. This has not been plugged in for about

251
01:15:15,880 --> 01:15:55,579
20 straight minutes. Hold on. We didn't hear. You guys did not hear that. Too close. I don't

252
01:15:55,579 --> 01:16:11,270
get it. We heard the end a little bit. Oh, I was doing that. This is plugged in now. All right.

253
01:16:11,270 --> 01:16:33,239
I'm ready. I'm ready to do a few more. I feel like the crossbow is going to be fun. Oh my goodness.

254
01:16:33,239 --> 01:16:56,300
That goes far. The trajectory on these bullets are weird. Clean the room. Clean your room.

255
01:16:56,300 --> 01:17:38,380
Bloody fire. I definitely want this eventually. Oh, a sprinkler. I like that. Cool. All right.

256
01:17:38,380 --> 01:17:54,739
So what am I going to buy? What am I buying? Do the ult. Make waves. That's what this thing was.

257
01:17:54,739 --> 01:18:07,210
This game's cool. I like it. All right. What am I doing? Should I use the heavy thing?

258
01:18:07,210 --> 01:18:21,819
Paintbrush seems really good. I'll do splat uh. Splat dualies I think. Dodge roll seems too good.

259
01:18:21,819 --> 01:18:30,970
Now what about other gear? You can buy two things. I don't know what I want though.

260
01:18:30,970 --> 01:18:47,420
I don't want to spend. I don't know what I want yet. All right. What do you got? Respawn

261
01:18:47,420 --> 01:18:57,800
Punisher. Okay. That's actually pretty good. Super jump speed. How do you do a super jump?

262
01:19:03,500 --> 01:19:31,779
That seems good too. Should I buy this other stuff? Somebody said this resets daily.

263
01:19:31,779 --> 01:19:45,050
Will I lose out on this? Don't worry about it. It resets in 30 minutes. Should I buy anything?

264
01:19:45,050 --> 01:19:50,680
It'll come back eventually. Okay. Well, whatever. So that's my shirt. Is there pants or anything?

265
01:19:50,680 --> 01:20:19,930
Okay. Weapons. Clothing. Shoes. Special power up. Oops. Hides your super jump landing point.

266
01:20:19,930 --> 01:20:39,880
That seems good. That seems good. Damage taken. That seems good. I think it's this one. Stealth

267
01:20:39,880 --> 01:20:56,779
jump is S tier. I feel like it's this one. Yeah. Anything else I can buy before I get back in?

268
01:20:56,779 --> 01:21:18,229
General? You're tacky. General? Hey, welcome to Atlantis. I don't really work here but you can

269
01:21:18,229 --> 01:21:23,859
shop around and I'll sell you stuff. Put it in your locker I guess. It's all pretty random.

270
01:21:23,859 --> 01:21:27,939
Your locker's in the locker room. Duh. You can go look at it later. Anything in there? I guess

271
01:21:27,939 --> 01:21:44,810
it's yours by default. Okay. What are these like stickers? All right. Oh, you can customize your

272
01:21:44,810 --> 01:22:32,500
banner. All right. Sure. Should I get a sports comic? What should I buy? What do I do with this?

273
01:22:32,500 --> 01:22:45,449
That's kind of a cool mechanic. Customize your locker. All right. Let's go to the locker.

274
01:22:45,449 --> 01:23:26,920
Is it in the lobby? Cool. Okay. Edit splash tag. It's to your right. Oh, there it is. Okay.

275
01:23:26,920 --> 01:23:55,880
Welcome to the locker room. Cool. Okay. That one's yours. These are other players' lockers? Okay.

276
01:23:55,880 --> 01:24:19,380
I don't know. What do I do? What should I do? Does it mean this? Edit? Okay. Wow. What is this?

277
01:24:19,380 --> 01:25:29,800
This is the fucking worst locker. Oh, whoa. Cool. Look at all this cool stuff. A shovel.

278
01:25:29,800 --> 01:25:51,210
Oh, man. Just hanging up my hats. Chairs. Oh, now this is a cool music one. You have no idea

279
01:25:51,210 --> 01:26:03,579
what's in those boxes. All right. I want to play a game. I'm playing now. I'm going to try my new

280
01:26:03,579 --> 01:26:17,380
loadout. Regular battle. I got to try it with the motion control. I'm going to be really pissed off.

281
01:26:17,380 --> 01:26:29,369
So just wait. Just wait for me to complain about the motion controls. It's going to happen. How

282
01:26:29,369 --> 01:26:36,170
should I be sitting? All right. So should I calibrate it with the controller kind of facing

283
01:26:36,170 --> 01:26:42,970
up? Where should my resting point be? What do you think? Should it be facing kind of down

284
01:26:42,970 --> 01:26:46,090
and then up? So I face down. Where do you think it should be? Where should I rest it?

285
01:26:46,090 --> 01:27:44,390
Let it rest on your lap. All right. You look goofy. Go. It's fucking weird to get. I can't get used

286
01:27:44,390 --> 01:28:31,979
to this in a game scenario. It's like, no, I feel like I know I have to go back. I can't like,

287
01:28:31,979 --> 01:29:04,199
no, no, it's going to make me puke. I can't do it. God. I can't use it. I can't do it. I

288
01:29:04,199 --> 01:29:17,800
got to go back. No, no fucking way. Not a chance in hell. Not a chance in hell. I don't think I

289
01:29:18,119 --> 01:29:32,090
don't think I've done one damage to a single other person. Let me drive my car over there.

290
01:29:32,810 --> 01:30:19,300
All right. Don't get mad. All right. This is actually not that bad. It's actually not that

291
01:30:19,300 --> 01:30:51,130
bad. Motion controls suck. Somebody wrote that in all caps. Let me try it without the motion

292
01:30:51,130 --> 01:31:10,539
controls again. You know what my problem is? It's not just the fact that it's motion controls,

293
01:31:10,539 --> 01:31:19,960
right? It's the fact that I still have to press B to jump and left trigger and rotate with the

294
01:31:19,960 --> 01:31:24,380
right stick. It's just, it's not all motion controls. You're right. Right. For me, it's got

295
01:31:24,380 --> 01:31:28,979
to go all in and nothing at all. Right. I got to go all in with most controls or not at all.

296
01:31:28,979 --> 01:31:43,130
Like I need to make sure that I don't press any buttons besides maybe one. Okay. In my mind,

297
01:31:43,130 --> 01:31:49,210
most controls are right. I got the sword and shield in both hands and there's one or two buttons

298
01:31:49,210 --> 01:31:55,000
here that I can press needing to move. I don't know. I can't do the move left and right with

299
01:31:55,079 --> 01:32:11,770
stick and motion controls. That's VR. Did you see how fucking weird VR is?

300
01:32:13,739 --> 01:32:19,340
VR is not a good example. How many times have you walked into your wall playing VR?

301
01:32:21,180 --> 01:32:23,819
How many times have you gone like this, take the headset off and go like,

302
01:32:26,199 --> 01:32:44,470
and then put it? No, it doesn't work that way. Less than you. Story mode. I will. I just like,

303
01:32:44,470 --> 01:33:04,390
I like playing this game. You're going to love the salmon run. I promise I'll try it.

304
01:33:11,979 --> 01:33:34,180
All right. Let's pull it together here. Get off. What do you, what did I just do?

305
01:33:41,850 --> 01:34:18,869
I just went back to the fountain. I forgot to buy boots. Let's go. How do I move? I don't even,

306
01:34:18,869 --> 01:35:08,569
I don't know how the thing even works in invader and there was an invader. All right. Oh, you're

307
01:35:08,569 --> 01:36:23,750
too fast. No motion controls. Andy, we're going to win. We're doing fine. What did you do? You

308
01:36:23,750 --> 01:36:43,050
stink wicked badly. I can see the green stink lines. I should be able to check a box.

309
01:36:43,609 --> 01:36:48,680
That is Cue me only with, with people that are not using motion controls.

310
01:36:48,680 --> 01:37:10,699
All the motion control Morty's can play with each other. That's fine. All right. This is actually,

311
01:37:10,699 --> 01:37:32,279
I promise this is the last one. Then I'm going to do story mode. Um, maybe I should hold on.

312
01:37:32,279 --> 01:38:05,289
Nah, it's too late. I was a sniper on the enemy team. It's bad. Did you just,

313
01:38:05,289 --> 01:38:20,300
did the person just teleport over here? I don't even know where the person came from.

314
01:38:21,100 --> 01:39:26,039
Does that go through walls? I can keyboard world of Warcraft turning. Wait, is that an enemy? No,

315
01:39:26,039 --> 01:40:19,539
the yellow freaks me out. What the hell? What does that thing do? Yeah. Don't let them get

316
01:40:19,539 --> 01:41:12,819
away with that. I think we win. We got a lot of, uh, I think we're good. Oh yeah. We're good.

317
01:41:12,819 --> 01:41:23,420
They had a disconnect. LOL. Try competitive. I'm not going to try. Why would I do that?

318
01:41:23,420 --> 01:41:27,909
Yeah. I just learned. Um, I just learned how to play the game. I'm going to do ranked.

319
01:41:27,909 --> 01:41:59,350
What? No way. What? All right. One more. Yeah. Well, I learned the controls,

320
01:41:59,350 --> 01:42:17,659
a time to queue up against people that probably have been playing the game for like 500 hours.

321
01:42:17,659 --> 01:42:45,260
All right. This is the one. Oh, I was going to dodge it. Shit. How come? Wait, where's our rollers?

322
01:43:21,220 --> 01:43:59,619
Sorry. Covered a lot of ground. Where are you? Where are you? I don't even know where they are.

323
01:43:59,619 --> 01:45:06,569
What the fuck? Whoa. Oh shit. Sorry. Come on. I was sitting there waiting for you.

324
01:45:07,609 --> 01:45:39,829
That was a good one. How come nobody told me this game was this fun? We did. I mean,

325
01:45:39,829 --> 01:45:45,739
some people did. And the recommended channel was like, Hey dude, you should really try Splatoon 3

326
01:45:45,739 --> 01:45:49,579
or any Splatoon. It would be all right. And they weren't that many like thumbs up on it.

327
01:45:50,300 --> 01:46:07,130
Like 15 to 25,000. So, I mean, I mean, a lot of people thought it was maybe some people did.

328
01:46:07,130 --> 01:46:18,340
Oh, listen up. It's going down. Repping Anarchy Splatcast. We're live. Let's see the current

329
01:46:18,340 --> 01:46:41,640
battle stages. Oh, are they changing stages? Go outside. You mean in real life? Go outside.

330
01:46:42,279 --> 01:46:51,739
Why do I feel like there's a surprise birthday party waiting for me out here?

331
01:46:51,739 --> 01:47:12,149
All right. What am I? What do you want me to do out here? Go to the grate.

332
01:47:20,939 --> 01:47:25,180
The frame rate is so weird out here. I feel like I have 3D glasses on without a 3D movie.

333
01:47:25,180 --> 01:47:55,079
Kind of hurts. All right. What do you want me to do? ZL. I've just pressed it. ZL. ZL. I'm pressing

334
01:47:55,079 --> 01:48:13,460
it. Oh my God. I just have just ZL. What is the? Why can't we just call buttons the same? They're

335
01:48:13,460 --> 01:48:16,659
all the same fucking controller. They have the same amount of buttons and they're in the exact

336
01:48:16,659 --> 01:48:37,449
same place. Why do we have to? Why do we have to call them different things? ZLZRL. L is for left.

337
01:48:37,449 --> 01:48:48,890
I know. But what is Z? I know Z is supposed to be the old N64 controller. Left bumper. Left trigger.

338
01:48:51,189 --> 01:49:18,140
L1. L2. ZL. No, you don't. Flip it. ZL. It should be LZ. So why did I come down here?

339
01:49:25,579 --> 01:50:09,109
Great Zapfish has gone missing. Okay. Go get the Zapfish. The pay is zero. Okay. Watch out.

340
01:50:09,109 --> 01:50:12,149
Watch out. That thing does curse damage. Watch out. That does curse damage. You'll instantly get

341
01:50:12,149 --> 01:50:32,199
killed. Octo-chirks. All right. So cool. Let's look for a way into the Ocarian base. If your

342
01:50:32,199 --> 01:51:00,649
ears open for my nuggets of wisdom. This way. All right. Let's go. Okay. Don't touch the fuzzy ooze.

343
01:51:00,649 --> 01:51:25,640
All right. That's cool. Let's go play the game. How do I get out of here? Tabletop mode? Pop that.

344
01:51:25,640 --> 01:51:51,319
The whole thing would move. Disappear. That didn't do anything. Do we have anything with more oom?

345
01:51:58,020 --> 01:53:19,399
Oh. Play the first level. All right. Okay. Let's go. Sick. This is pretty good burp core. Burp core.

346
01:53:19,399 --> 01:53:50,069
Ooh. This is actually, this is pretty good. Rugrats core. You're right. That's a cool move.

347
01:53:50,069 --> 01:54:15,159
Splat switch. Does this tell me how to aim at the center of my screen? Is it crate? Where? Far away

348
01:54:15,159 --> 01:55:51,880
crate. Nice job. I got a toaster. Oh, come on. How do I get up there? Uh-oh. Watch out. An Octo-trooper.

349
01:55:51,880 --> 01:56:39,609
This is LittleBigPlanet2 custom game. God. That's actually true. This is really what it feels like

350
01:56:39,609 --> 01:57:06,939
that. That's a Zapfish. How do I get it? Bring it home? How do I pick it up? Oh, it's gonna be stuck

351
01:57:06,939 --> 01:57:19,020
in my head all day. That's, that's fun. That's cool that you can do that. Single player is pretty

352
01:57:19,020 --> 01:57:40,310
cool. Let's go back to be, uh, let's do some multiplayer. That was cool. How do I get out of

353
01:57:40,310 --> 01:58:11,659
here? How do I get out of here? Menu then. Yeah. I have to go to, I have to go to the crate. Okay.

354
01:58:11,659 --> 01:58:26,010
All right. There we go. Do salmon run. Let me do some more multiplayer. That's my favorite.

355
01:58:26,010 --> 01:58:36,779
I'll do salmon run in another 30 minutes. All right. In 30 minutes, I will do salmon run. I

356
01:58:36,779 --> 01:59:02,789
promise. I feel like I'm just starting to get good. Put on a 30 minute timer. Yeah. Mods. You can do

357
01:59:02,789 --> 01:59:24,949
it. You need motion controls to improve. I think I'm doing okay. Salmon run is co-op. Well, let's,

358
01:59:24,949 --> 01:59:57,750
let's do it. Cue up for it. Well, not right now, but you know, later. I like these a lot. You can

359
01:59:57,750 --> 02:00:05,560
do Zelda. Yep. After I'm done playing split two and three, I will get booted from the servers.

360
02:00:05,560 --> 02:00:22,979
Apparently I might have to restart the game. We'll find out. I like the, the actual just

361
02:00:22,979 --> 02:00:27,239
play the game against players is probably my favorite part. I don't think this is going to

362
02:00:27,239 --> 02:00:51,380
work. Only salmon run servers are up right now. No, you're a liar. All right. Let's go for it.

363
02:00:51,380 --> 02:01:13,189
You got banned for being over 16. What? This is a new map. Oh, caught a few off guard.

364
02:01:13,989 --> 02:03:13,529
I ran into a fucking pole. That shit out of here. I don't know this map. What the fuck? What? I

365
02:03:13,529 --> 02:03:19,619
don't even know what just happened. I can't see. I thought I killed that person. Apparently they

366
02:03:19,619 --> 02:03:37,939
went under. I don't know what is going on, man. All right. We're going to pull this back right now.

367
02:03:38,579 --> 02:03:53,960
Wipe the whole team. All right. Come on, come on, come on, come on. Spread it, spread it, spread it.

368
02:03:53,960 --> 02:03:59,619
Ink, ink, ink, ink, ink, ink, ink, ink, ink, ink, ink, ink, ink, ink, ink. Oh, I think we are.

369
02:03:59,619 --> 02:04:29,220
We're good. Oh, yeah, we got it. Oh, for sure. Salmon run salmon run servers are up. Oh,

370
02:04:29,220 --> 02:04:56,439
are they really level five? Stop bullying this new clothes. I'll check. I got last place. I didn't

371
02:04:56,439 --> 02:05:04,890
get last place. Let's be honest. We're all within a hundred points of each other. We all contributed

372
02:05:04,890 --> 02:05:40,420
very well. Your catalog leveled up. I'll check it after this. You're getting carried by viewers.

373
02:05:40,420 --> 02:06:38,220
That's all right. What does this do? What the hell was that? I, you know what? I just still don't.

374
02:06:38,220 --> 02:07:43,699
Yeah, I don't understand how to use that fucking thing. I'm just not going to use that fucking

375
02:07:43,699 --> 02:08:44,649
old. It fucks me up. I don't know. Why am I even getting into the mechanical object?

376
02:08:45,369 --> 02:09:25,000
I think we're OK. Nice nerd voice. That was kind of a George. All right. Let me go check out the

377
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:34,939
gear. I was come on. Look at I did. I I may have done a couple of I screwed up a little.

378
02:09:34,939 --> 02:09:52,579
I think we did all right. All right. Let me go to the shop. Some new stuff, right?

379
02:09:54,899 --> 02:10:25,100
Ooh, your catalog level went up. Cool. Growing rookie detergent. Expensive. That's not funny

380
02:10:25,100 --> 02:10:54,260
to waste all my money. Oh, wow. There is new stuff. All right. What does this do? Special weapon

381
02:10:54,260 --> 02:11:06,020
increases damage dealt to all non-player targets. Squid rolls and squid surge is easier to easier

382
02:11:06,020 --> 02:11:22,779
to do. I can't. I feel like that's pretty good. Ink tank refill rate. That seems really good.

383
02:11:22,779 --> 02:11:54,229
What do we got? Special saver is the same thing. That's good. That's good, too. Should I do double

384
02:11:54,229 --> 02:12:10,619
ink tank? That seems kind of good. There's diminishing returns. OK, maybe I should just

385
02:12:10,619 --> 02:12:31,800
keep the thing I have on movement speed. Oh, I think I want that. I feel like I'm too slow

386
02:12:31,800 --> 02:12:59,260
by that yellow shirt. All right, let's go. You look really struggle scrunchily. What's that mean?

387
02:12:59,260 --> 02:13:17,529
Oh, there's a is that a sword? Hold on. What is that umbrella? We're going to test some shit up.

388
02:13:17,529 --> 02:13:38,229
Whoa, this defense. I like this. Everyone stands behind you or you could just like

389
02:13:38,630 --> 02:13:50,699
them. OK, sprinkler. And you only have one of those active at a time. Yeah.

390
02:14:00,470 --> 02:14:08,180
Oh, you lose it. I'm assuming it has a respawn. All right. That's cool. What about the special?

391
02:14:08,180 --> 02:14:42,899
Special whisper time. I like it. Maybe I'll try it. That's what that is. What about what we got?

392
02:14:42,899 --> 02:14:56,890
Umbrella. This new sword. That's a windshield wiper. All right. This thing seems amazing.

393
02:15:00,819 --> 02:15:19,060
Am I invisible? Am I visible when I do this? A stealth or something? Oh, it's just the camera.

394
02:15:19,060 --> 02:15:31,960
OK. Is that a homing missile? All right. I'm definitely going to try this. I mean,

395
02:15:31,960 --> 02:15:38,310
you can just like whack, whack, whack, whack, charge it up and bang. This seems amazing.

396
02:15:38,869 --> 02:15:49,180
OK, what about the this is what everybody was doing? OK, this team. This is broken.

397
02:15:59,180 --> 02:16:33,700
Very cool. All right. So what else? A Nintendo blaster. Cool. I imagine this is just a lot.

398
02:16:33,700 --> 02:16:53,739
Very high damage, short range and great ink coverage. It does, doesn't it? All right.

399
02:16:53,819 --> 02:17:11,059
What's the special tuna healing station? I imagine. Or is it an ink station?

400
02:17:11,059 --> 02:17:29,379
It's a speed bump. Cool. All right. What's the difference between this one and this one?

401
02:17:29,379 --> 02:17:43,239
There are so many weapons in this game. This one faster carbon roller is faster,

402
02:17:43,239 --> 02:17:51,610
but weaker. Actually, I would like this way more. You can actually get some coverage.

403
02:17:51,610 --> 02:18:16,120
Well, Tune 2 had over 300 weapons. What? In my brain, it was just this thing,

404
02:18:16,120 --> 02:18:20,260
the regular gun in the sniper rifle. I didn't think it was this detailed. I really didn't.

405
02:18:20,819 --> 02:18:49,739
All right. What's the special look like? I don't know. What the hell? That's weird.

406
02:18:49,739 --> 02:18:57,139
All right. Well, I'm going to do I'm going to do I'm going to do the sword and umbrella.

407
02:18:57,139 --> 02:19:19,909
Is it a flamethrower cleanup? What is this? Oh, I get it. So you can be like, all right,

408
02:19:19,909 --> 02:19:39,750
throw that shit and you know what I mean? Like this pop. Oh, that's really cool. I like that.

409
02:19:39,750 --> 02:20:23,899
I like it. Wait, Jesus. I still think I'm going with the I'm going with the sword sword and I'll

410
02:20:23,899 --> 02:20:36,950
try I'll get this thing. I'll try this thing. Are you going to be mad if I have to pee again?

411
02:20:36,950 --> 02:23:03,819
Right back. Okie dokie. His aim is awful. I don't think I can't see what you're writing.

412
02:23:03,819 --> 02:23:12,950
Don't act like I can't see what you just wrote. OK, so I got my new weapon. I'm ready to go.

413
02:23:12,950 --> 02:23:23,799
We heard you dodge roll while you peed. Can you imagine that? It's just a stream of piss.

414
02:23:24,680 --> 02:23:28,709
And then like, I don't think you would. Well, you wouldn't think I dodge rolled.

415
02:23:28,709 --> 02:23:40,899
You think I like fell down. You just hear the fat rolling sound with a bunch of gear on.

416
02:23:40,899 --> 02:23:54,389
All right, let's play. I want to see the funny platoon messages.

417
02:23:56,389 --> 02:24:06,979
Well, you're going to have to wait until you play. Turn on post. I'm not doing it.

418
02:24:09,190 --> 02:24:27,270
I'm not doing it. I'm not doing it. The plaza is full of drawings.

419
02:24:27,270 --> 02:24:35,000
All right. Can you confirm or deny that? What if I maybe I'll check it out?

420
02:24:35,000 --> 02:24:40,979
Maybe if you're good on your birthday. All right, let's go check it out.

421
02:24:56,709 --> 02:25:41,940
I didn't I got so mad right there. We got it. We got it. We got it. We got it. We got it.

422
02:25:41,940 --> 02:26:10,219
Sorry, I thought you were an enemy. Get that shit away from me. What was that little dog?

423
02:26:10,219 --> 02:27:37,829
What was that little dog? Let's go. I got no ink. All right, man, I was I was going nuts there.

424
02:28:02,629 --> 02:28:11,049
I'm impressed you didn't fall into the water. Can you actually does it kill you?

425
02:28:11,049 --> 02:28:20,709
I'll try salmon run on your birthday. I didn't let's get off that screen because

426
02:28:20,709 --> 02:28:24,780
I didn't really do that. I did a lot of kill stealing, I think. No, I didn't.

427
02:28:24,780 --> 02:28:31,479
I got a lot of secured kills. You saw it was like pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop.

428
02:28:31,479 --> 02:28:55,110
I did pretty good. It's my birthday today. Well, happy. All right. Happy birthday.

429
02:28:55,110 --> 02:29:01,540
We'll play salmon run. I didn't know it was your birthday today. Happy birthday.

430
02:29:02,500 --> 02:30:06,579
I miss I was doing pretty good, too. That's unfortunate. It's the same spot in the same

431
02:30:06,579 --> 02:30:43,079
spot, dude. Are you kidding me? I died in the same place. Pixel perfect. We got them all.

432
02:30:43,719 --> 02:31:08,100
Let's go. One minute left. All right, we can pull this together right now.

433
02:31:19,370 --> 02:32:06,409
There was somebody behind me. I'm going to install it. We all right. We're doing good.

434
02:32:06,409 --> 02:32:14,819
I think we actually pulled it back. Look at that. Look what we did in that last 10 seconds.

435
02:32:14,819 --> 02:32:34,700
We had to have gotten it. Yep. Throw your switch in the trash. That's so funny because the switch is

436
02:32:34,700 --> 02:32:42,139
the only console that is big enough to throw away in the trash like it's a crumpled up piece

437
02:32:42,139 --> 02:32:49,739
of paper. You can actually just drop it into the trash. You can't do that with a PS5 or Xbox.

438
02:32:50,680 --> 02:33:10,200
It's too big. All right. This is the last one. I still want to play Breath of the Wild, too.

439
02:33:10,840 --> 02:33:20,459
I like this weapon. It doesn't do very much damage, but it secures kills.

440
02:33:22,459 --> 02:33:26,139
I don't do a whole lot of painting, but I've secured a lot of kills. You know it.

441
02:33:27,100 --> 02:34:01,270
Don't tell me I haven't. You know it. You've seen it. Let me try. Might as well put the other

442
02:34:01,270 --> 02:34:19,399
weapon on then, right? This is the new one I got. Oh, this one you shake, shake, shake, shake,

443
02:34:19,399 --> 02:34:27,930
shake, shake, bro. This got a lot of spread on it. This is actually pretty damn good.

444
02:34:27,930 --> 02:34:32,549
All right. How does this one work? Yeah. All right. We'll try this.

445
02:34:35,610 --> 02:34:41,030
Please beatbox the Splatoon 3 theme. I, I don't

446
02:34:45,989 --> 02:35:06,309
I don't think I can do it. All right. I'm actually going to get to play or what?

447
02:35:06,309 --> 02:35:15,299
I don't like the water levels. You die instantly. This is GTA 3.

448
02:35:16,020 --> 02:35:57,540
So yeah, I didn't get anybody. How did that not get one person? That's

449
02:35:57,540 --> 02:36:02,020
un possible. That's impossible. What? I didn't get one person. I hit everybody.

450
02:36:18,700 --> 02:36:44,250
You got a person. Okay. This game is fun. Damn. That was like three else at the same time.

451
02:36:44,250 --> 02:37:37,780
What's that bubble launcher? I want that. Did you see what happened? Cause I don't.

452
02:37:37,780 --> 02:37:54,600
Where were you? I think we lost. Oh my God. That's a wipe out. Over did that. You're an absolute pro

453
02:37:55,319 --> 02:38:27,459
got that coverage. I was, I was only looking for coverage. I wasn't looking for kills.

454
02:38:27,459 --> 02:38:52,729
I was looking for coverage, not kills. And we got it. It's been 30 minutes.

455
02:38:52,729 --> 02:39:07,780
All right. I'm going to play one more and then that's it. And I'll do, um, salmon run.

456
02:39:07,780 --> 02:39:34,469
If this is not the last one before salmon run, I will take a bite out of my switch.

457
02:39:34,469 --> 02:39:38,940
I, okay. But I don't have to play that for a while. I can come right back to this,

458
02:39:38,940 --> 02:40:06,149
but I will try salmon run after this. We need more coverage guys. What's going on here?

459
02:40:06,149 --> 02:40:10,409
Guys, where's the coverage? Am I good? I have to take care of everything here.

460
02:40:11,129 --> 02:42:33,739
Where's the coverage? There we go. Good coverage. Good coverage. How do you jump?

461
02:42:33,739 --> 02:42:55,260
Just zone, zone, zone, zone them, zone them, zone them. That's going to be one of the best of the

462
02:42:55,260 --> 02:43:29,219
night. You just made my seven year old nephew cry, dude. What the fuck? I want it. Can I see the,

463
02:43:29,780 --> 02:43:41,209
let's get a screenshot of that one. Just saying. All right. Where's the salmon run thing?

464
02:43:51,559 --> 02:44:11,579
Same place, right? But where do I do it? Okay. I guess I'll just do this one, right? Whatever

465
02:44:11,579 --> 02:44:35,299
this is on fishing hydro plant map. Wait, what do you want me to do? Riz Co. Happy birthday, by the

466
02:44:35,299 --> 02:45:29,190
way. Don't skip this. I'm ready. Tutorial. The tutorial is mega important. All right. Okay.

467
02:45:29,989 --> 02:45:40,299
Listen up. Salmon is, will approach from the water. Get rid of them. They drop power eggs.

468
02:45:43,260 --> 02:46:25,909
Okay. Is he enough? Why are the graphics better? Okay. More power eggs. Cool.

469
02:46:28,549 --> 02:46:36,579
Sounds good. Harvest golden eggs. Only boss salmonids have those. Boss salmonid

470
02:46:36,579 --> 02:47:01,959
alert. I like the colors. All right. There's a boss salmonid somewhere. You have to walk into

471
02:47:01,959 --> 02:47:17,899
these. Okay. You have to get golden eggs. Take them back to the egg basket and only hold one

472
02:47:17,899 --> 02:47:55,639
at a time. Okay. Okay. So they can steal them and take them back, right? How many people play in

473
02:47:55,639 --> 02:48:15,420
a game? Okay. I think I get it. Okay. Communicating with your coworkers is an essential part of egg

474
02:48:15,420 --> 02:48:39,379
collection. What just happened? Oh, okay. Okay. So if everybody dies, it's over. Up is asked for

475
02:48:39,379 --> 02:48:51,190
help. Okay. Okay. I get it. It's like zombies. I actually never really played zombies at all.

476
02:48:57,850 --> 02:49:39,260
Cool. We have 100 seconds. Okay. Got it. Grow your golden egg. Oh, so you can toss it to

477
02:49:39,260 --> 02:50:01,979
people. I got it. All right. So you have to stay alive till the end. Do you get points for doing

478
02:50:01,979 --> 02:50:32,700
extra golden eggs or no? Or oh, you do, I think. Okay. Literally on screen. You only get two uses

479
02:50:32,700 --> 02:50:50,219
of your special. Who has this move? Because that's amazing. That's so much fun. Whose move is this?

480
02:50:50,940 --> 02:51:06,010
Somebody have this in the actual game? They do the tri slasher. All right. I want to try. I want to

481
02:51:06,010 --> 02:51:44,739
play with that. But first, another round of training. All right. This is an important one.

482
02:51:44,899 --> 02:52:07,500
All right. I'll pay attention. Okay. The not basics. There are 11 kinds of bosses.

483
02:52:09,540 --> 02:52:15,129
Which one do you want? Does it matter? This one?

484
02:52:24,389 --> 02:52:41,819
Do all of them. Just do all of them. Um, okay. Place a bomb. What's up? What do you mean place a

485
02:52:41,819 --> 02:53:05,500
bomb? Does that count? All right. Steelhead. It lobs giant smelly. Um, what does it say?

486
02:53:05,500 --> 02:53:32,870
Shoot the bomb on his head. Hey, how do you, I don't have the range to hit that. I can't reach

487
02:53:32,870 --> 02:54:34,520
that far. It happens so fast. What the fuck? All right. So that's that one. Launches missiles,

488
02:54:34,520 --> 02:55:31,639
toss a bomb into both of its missile launchers. I was going to say that did not go in there.

489
02:55:44,440 --> 02:55:55,479
Okay. This is much easier with four players. Yeah. All right. Scrapper

490
02:55:58,629 --> 02:56:04,870
covers its frail body and shields made of cookware and putters forward. Okay. Get behind it.

491
02:56:26,139 --> 02:56:40,299
Cool. All right. We're like almost halfway there. Don't let it touch you.

492
02:56:43,059 --> 02:56:45,940
The slimy pilot is sitting in the tail end. So I hit it in the tail.

493
02:56:46,739 --> 02:56:55,270
We do really have to do all these. I feel like I could just be in voice chat and somebody will

494
02:56:55,270 --> 02:56:58,709
just peek, blow out their microphones, screaming at me for what I need to do.

495
02:56:59,350 --> 02:57:02,790
And then call me a bunch of names because I didn't do it right. And then I'll figure it out. I'll

496
02:57:02,790 --> 02:57:25,370
learn. We're almost done. I might as well do more. Stinger sits on top of a tower. Okay.

497
02:57:51,610 --> 02:57:59,219
Did that one. All right. Drizzler. Our torpedoes that create clouds that rain ink. When it's under

498
02:57:59,219 --> 02:58:05,989
its umbrella, your attacks can't hurt it. So he peeks. You can also hit its rockets to knock

499
02:58:05,989 --> 02:58:52,260
them back. All right. All right. Fish stick. They plant a pillar in the ground and flying

500
02:58:52,260 --> 02:58:57,379
circles around the top and spray ink all over. The pillar will stick around once they're gone.

501
02:58:57,379 --> 02:59:21,579
So put it to good use. All right. You have to climb the pillar. I get it.

502
02:59:32,549 --> 02:59:38,149
Flipper throws out an ink ring, then dives into it. Do not get caught inside the ring.

503
02:59:38,950 --> 02:59:43,100
Cover the ring in your own ink before it can dive. Then it'll be a little bump.

504
02:59:43,100 --> 03:00:04,629
All right. Cool. I'm a salmon runner and it gets much harder than this. I would imagine it does.

505
03:00:04,629 --> 03:00:12,739
I'm gonna get some more. Big shot launcher. Jump over the shock waves from the cannon balls.

506
03:00:13,459 --> 03:00:58,709
Cool. Use the cannon. All right. This is a UFO. Walk under it and it'll try to squash you.

507
03:00:59,430 --> 03:01:03,350
If it tries to squash you and you dodge, you can climb on top and take it out. All right.

508
03:01:23,209 --> 03:01:55,430
Let's go. That wraps up the training. All right. Let's do it. Thanks for sticking with the tutorial.

509
03:01:57,829 --> 03:02:18,420
One last thing. It's all random. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Let's do it.

510
03:02:19,219 --> 03:02:25,399
Relance team of randoms. I mean, I just, there's no way. I'm not going to put like a code in the chat

511
03:02:26,780 --> 03:02:31,739
and we're going to a hundred million people are going to try to join. I'm just going random.

512
03:02:31,739 --> 03:03:01,690
How far can you actually throw this? Does it depend on your ink? Let's do it. Let's get it.

513
03:03:01,690 --> 03:03:46,549
Hey, as we say, let's get it. All right. Wave one. Oh, boss salmon alert. It's umbrella. Nice

514
03:03:46,549 --> 03:04:08,500
work. Nice work crew. Nice work. All right. That's good. Let's, uh, let's go back to the other game

515
03:04:08,500 --> 03:04:39,750
now. Oops. I didn't mean to press that. I ended up working out with grenades. We do have grenades.

516
03:04:39,750 --> 03:04:50,780
Okay. All right. I didn't know if you had to buy them. Boss incoming. What is it? It's a frying pan.

517
03:04:51,500 --> 03:05:31,030
Oh shit. We did it. All right. Wave two. What's wrong with us? What's wrong with us?

518
03:05:33,510 --> 03:06:20,420
What the fuck just happened? Who's coming? Who is it? What is it? Oh, it's a tower.

519
03:06:21,299 --> 03:07:23,879
Chow crash can. This is cool. He hates this night. What? No, I don't. You've been loaned

520
03:07:23,879 --> 03:07:32,649
the Octo brush by a final wave. All right. This is pretty tight.

521
03:09:03,290 --> 03:09:20,100
Nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Knock out. Knock out. Piece of cake.

522
03:09:20,659 --> 03:09:49,079
Okay. So that was fun. So we get currency for this. Do you buy weapons? Okay. You got a raise.

523
03:09:53,959 --> 03:10:24,780
Oh, I got an egg to open. Is that a surprise egg? So you get a rank up and it gets harder. All

524
03:10:24,780 --> 03:10:45,639
right. I think I understand. Oh, this. I want this thing so bad. Splatoon is just cool. Look

525
03:10:45,639 --> 03:10:53,420
at your awesome new Mega Man weapon that you just got. The video game. I love it. I want to use this

526
03:10:53,420 --> 03:11:02,569
now. When do I get to kill cut man? When's electricity man die? So I get his electricity

527
03:11:02,569 --> 03:11:46,229
bubbles. Oh, it's, um, no, I guess we got them. Okay. What is the grenade for this?

528
03:11:46,950 --> 03:12:18,600
Actually, I don't know what it does. I think it's regular. Just regular. We're good, right?

529
03:12:18,600 --> 03:12:42,040
Best of all, this music is bumping. It is pretty bumping. You're right. Splasher. Oh, medic. All

530
03:12:42,040 --> 03:13:20,680
right. Where are they coming from? Which side are they often? Do I get credit for helping? Oh,

531
03:13:20,680 --> 03:13:36,979
do I have to actually score it? Am I messing points up for myself? Oh, look out. Where is it?

532
03:13:41,450 --> 03:14:36,139
Down here. Oh, thank you. Holy shit. Okay. I think we just lost. Revive me quick so I get experience.

533
03:14:36,139 --> 03:15:11,299
Okay. Yeah. Now we're talking. Now I'm going to be doing some big, big damage. What's that mean?

534
03:15:11,860 --> 03:16:16,420
Stop idling. Who cares? Just put it in. All right. Now to survive. All right. We're good. 14

535
03:16:16,420 --> 03:16:44,440
things. Oh my goodness. Whereas the teammate don't have to just shoot at it. We did really good in

536
03:16:44,440 --> 03:17:13,399
the last wave. Stay with your team at all times. Okay. Go get another, uh, hat. All right. Somebody

537
03:17:13,399 --> 03:17:36,250
said that the, on the shelf is my stuff. Where is it? Oh, it can't be in queue. Okay. So when does

538
03:17:36,250 --> 03:19:28,680
this start becoming really, really hard right now? Umbrella down here. Watch that side. Where's this

539
03:19:28,680 --> 03:19:45,540
boss? Six out of six. I feel like we missed out on something. Did we miss out on something? Or was

540
03:19:45,540 --> 03:20:05,219
it not on the right side? 96 gal? This does not seem like the greatest thing to spread out paint.

541
03:20:05,780 --> 03:20:53,670
Do a taunt. Crashcan. Where's everybody? Oh, come here. Come here. Come here. I got you. I got you.

542
03:21:06,920 --> 03:21:39,750
Oh, we're good, right? Oh my God. We just got absolutely detonated. I think we're good. Yeah,

543
03:21:40,309 --> 03:22:00,459
we're good. Final wave. I guess I fell in the water. What happens?

544
03:22:09,239 --> 03:23:45,979
Help me. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. What does this do? Holy shit. So this is the gentleman's cod zombies.

545
03:23:45,979 --> 03:24:12,139
This webcam going to like two FPS. Do one more because it's going to be so hard now. Okay.

546
03:24:12,139 --> 03:24:45,750
All right. Now I'm at part timer. Now the surprise egg. Uh, let's do it again. It's going to be a bit

547
03:24:45,750 --> 03:25:03,879
harder. I'm so happy you're playing this. This is my favorite mode. I did not know there was this

548
03:25:03,879 --> 03:25:17,780
much content in Splatoon. I saw Splatoon as like a side game. I don't know why. Oh yeah. It's just

549
03:25:17,780 --> 03:25:22,340
an extra game mode for this other. It's like an extra game. It's like portal in the orange box,

550
03:25:23,379 --> 03:25:28,700
but portal was awesome. I don't know why I was like, yeah, it's just like a game. It's not really

551
03:25:28,700 --> 03:25:50,780
a game. I didn't, I didn't know there was this much to do. All I ever knew Splatoon was as the

552
03:25:50,780 --> 03:26:14,020
Wii U big brick side game. That's all I know. Monster. That's what you call an A minus move.

553
03:26:55,719 --> 03:27:13,590
Yo, we need that. Throw it in. Oh, sorry. The game is going to get content updates for two more

554
03:27:13,590 --> 03:27:24,280
years for free. Really? I just thought this was the Wii U brick side game. I didn't know.

555
03:27:37,270 --> 03:27:51,430
Help, help, help, help, help. Sorry. It's okay. Sorry. I got one in. It's all right. Come on,

556
03:27:51,430 --> 03:28:26,180
man. I got to get over there. Did I go win? All right. Good. Uh, he's weird behind a wall.

557
03:28:26,180 --> 03:29:12,059
Good. Got it. I'll take left side. We have the left side. They can't hear you.

558
03:29:15,979 --> 03:30:06,790
Best weapon in the game. Oh shit. Okay. I can get it from over here. Looking good, right?

559
03:30:06,790 --> 03:30:32,680
There's a couple more. What's raining on us? Something's raining on us. What is firing? Oh,

560
03:30:45,959 --> 03:31:05,100
oh shit. It's that. Oh my God. Get up there. Pick one of these up. What's happening to my body?

561
03:31:05,100 --> 03:31:14,899
What the hell was that? I couldn't pick one up. Why couldn't I pick one up? I had one.

562
03:31:17,180 --> 03:31:33,860
I didn't know I had one. This is as fun as the regular game. This is really cool. I like this a

563
03:31:33,860 --> 03:31:47,239
lot. All right. I'm going to get to the next rank and we'll see. I do want to play Breath of the

564
03:31:47,239 --> 03:31:53,139
Wild for at least an hour or two. Or do I just play Splatoon and the Breath of the Wild fans

565
03:31:53,139 --> 03:32:05,959
are going to be very mad about this? I don't know. What should I do? Breath of the Wild has a lot of

566
03:32:05,959 --> 03:32:23,180
fans. I'm not sure they would like that. I do a poll. Do you want me to continue playing Splatoon

567
03:32:23,180 --> 03:32:30,020
for the rest of the stream and whatever? More Splatoon or Breath of the Wild in another 30

568
03:32:30,020 --> 03:32:49,579
minutes? Breath of the Wild in 30 minutes or Splatoon for the rest of the stream? It's going

569
03:32:49,579 --> 03:33:11,430
to get hard. Oh, I need to be the one that hits that. This is my job. I'm going to get up top.

570
03:33:11,430 --> 03:34:32,250
I got it. Oh, you got it. You're good. Oh my god. Oh, OK. We're good. All right. What are we

571
03:34:32,250 --> 03:34:52,819
doing? Splatoon one by a lot. Oh, man. That was close. That was so close. That's so close.

572
03:34:53,620 --> 03:35:57,299
Is that too close to call? No, it's not. It's over. Chainsaw. Another trash can. Trash can.

573
03:36:14,680 --> 03:36:33,719
Thank you. Why won't this thing fucking die? All right. We could do another poll. That's not how

574
03:36:33,719 --> 03:37:19,799
it works, man. Two thousand people voted out of fifteen thousand. Watch out for the dog. Roger

575
03:37:19,799 --> 03:38:49,690
that. Umbrella. Giant. Giant. We're good. Who are you talking to? You should delay the switch

576
03:38:49,690 --> 03:39:18,780
break. What else is there to play? What else is there to play? Not much, right? So what do I? I

577
03:39:18,780 --> 03:39:28,680
got to leave, right? So I want to get my shit. So where do I do that? I have to be out of the lobby?

578
03:39:37,739 --> 03:39:46,360
Front desk. Where's that? You can do Mario Odyssey. I already played Mario Odyssey.

579
03:39:46,360 --> 03:39:58,870
I already beat it on my own time. It's in this room. Oh, here we go.

580
03:40:00,549 --> 03:40:18,709
Let's open them. Oh, what did I get? Swap for chunks. I don't get it. Keep new gear. I mean,

581
03:40:18,709 --> 03:40:40,010
that one's better, right? I'll keep the new one. Slop suit. A green slop suit. I don't know.

582
03:40:56,219 --> 03:41:22,620
I'm almost at a part timer. Can you play grounded? I actually wanted to play it.

583
03:41:22,620 --> 03:41:56,680
I actually wanted to try it. Okay. I'm trying to give us some, uh, some avenues here.

584
03:42:02,600 --> 03:42:44,340
Shit. There's a perfect throw too. Thank you. We need it. Quester time. I didn't, did I not throw

585
03:42:44,340 --> 03:43:25,139
it? We're good. We're good. We're good. We're fine. Don't hit me off. Oh my God. I hate water so

586
03:43:25,139 --> 03:43:46,860
much. I'm never drinking it ever again. Only Gatorade from now on. Only Gatorade. Why is it

587
03:43:46,860 --> 03:43:59,989
getting so dark? A giant tornado is approaching. What's that mean? Where's my teammates? Where'd

588
03:43:59,989 --> 03:44:53,079
they go? Where'd the team go? Uh oh. Oh, we're good. Okay. That was fun. What happens if you

589
03:44:53,079 --> 03:45:09,700
get them all? We got every single one. There's a big golden chest over here. Holy shit. What?

590
03:45:09,700 --> 03:45:14,260
All right. I have an idea. I'm going to throw them over here and you guys get them and throw

591
03:45:14,260 --> 03:46:15,500
them that way. We're good. That was a lot. All right. Final wave over here. We got at least five

592
03:46:15,500 --> 03:46:23,860
or six. Oh my God. I'm never drinking water. I'm never going to go swimming. I'm never going to

593
03:46:23,860 --> 03:46:46,219
drink water. I'm only going to... Oh my God. It's me. Where's head? We all died instantly. That was

594
03:46:46,219 --> 03:47:01,110
instantaneous. Holy shit. That was just... We all popped in five seconds. Jerma, you're 70% water.

595
03:47:01,110 --> 03:47:20,229
Get it out of me. Get off me. That one doesn't count. That one doesn't count. Why is my camera

596
03:47:20,469 --> 03:47:32,170
frame ratey right now? Is it? Kind of is. Why is it frame ratey? That one doesn't count.

597
03:47:51,819 --> 03:48:11,719
When are you going to play Breath of the Wild? Okay. So it was 53% to 47%. What does my vote

598
03:48:11,719 --> 03:48:28,620
count for? How many percentage points does my vote count for? 5%? I would say, I would probably say

599
03:48:28,620 --> 03:48:36,620
at least 10%. How many shares of my own company do I own? Right? That's got to be a lot.

600
03:48:37,420 --> 03:49:38,010
Do streamers play this game? Deadass. I'm going to leave the stream if you don't. What? It's rare?

601
03:49:38,649 --> 03:50:10,059
Vinny does? Vinny plays? Hmm. Shit. Watch out. Streamers are surprised that Nintendo games are

602
03:50:10,059 --> 03:50:29,670
fun. We have some mods. We have some mod opinions here. I have a senior investor. I have a good

603
03:50:29,670 --> 03:51:21,750
chunk of stock. Well, all right. Leather jacket. What's your share vote? It's typing. Get out of

604
03:51:21,750 --> 03:51:42,940
the fucking way. You're so annoying. Leather jacket is deferring choice to streamers choice.

605
03:51:42,940 --> 03:52:01,899
Okay. I'm just sitting around. I'm the CEO. God damn it. VR Josh has deferred his vote to the CEO.

606
03:52:01,899 --> 03:52:17,620
Okay. Grump said that seems like you're enjoying Splatoon. I defer my voice to

607
03:52:18,340 --> 03:52:26,309
streamers choice, which is Splatoon 3. Why can't I talk? I'm speech jamming myself.

608
03:52:27,190 --> 03:52:41,180
What's this? What do we have to do with this? ZL. What do I do about what's this? What do we do with

609
03:52:41,180 --> 03:53:37,450
that? Bro, what's happening? What? I don't even understand this game mode. Why are there big giant

610
03:53:37,450 --> 03:54:18,059
marbles everywhere? This fucking orbital strike fly fish. Well, somebody explained to me what those

611
03:54:18,059 --> 03:54:23,340
those bait giant bait balls were. They didn't even know what they were. I didn't even know what they

612
03:54:23,340 --> 03:54:32,440
were. ZL, look at this huge ball. This is a weird game mode. What was that? I thought we had to move

613
03:54:32,440 --> 03:54:52,920
those. I would have been in there with the team. They're turrets. I thought I had to roll those down

614
03:54:52,920 --> 03:54:57,959
into the basket. They look just like this. They're the same exact color, the same sheen, everything.

615
03:54:58,520 --> 03:55:28,680
They're the same color, same sheen, same metal. Art time, Perry. All right. So we have three

616
03:55:28,680 --> 03:55:40,680
mods that have deferred their shares. I mean, I've got to see what Burger Boy has to say.

617
03:55:40,680 --> 03:55:50,520
He's one of the biggest shareholders. Hey, dude, need your opinion on I need a share vote on a game.

618
03:55:50,520 --> 03:55:59,959
Hold on. Is he watching? Let's see. Breath of the Wild for Splatoon. Need opinion. Need votes for

619
03:55:59,959 --> 03:56:35,180
your shares. You have 20,000. He's typing. Bro, your stream sucks now. I sold all my shares a year

620
03:56:35,180 --> 03:57:22,549
and a half ago. Do it again. What's this weird golden one? Dude, what the fuck is this little

621
03:57:22,549 --> 03:57:39,030
weirdo? Why are you using your special in wave one? I've never even seen that guy before. Oh,

622
03:57:39,030 --> 03:57:52,340
wait. I have three shares left. Forgot about them. I put my three shares to Splatoon. I put what?

623
03:57:52,340 --> 03:58:50,739
You lose rank? That's not good. All right. Kind of pay attention. No more fucking around. Just unlock.

624
03:58:50,739 --> 03:59:44,540
You don't need the team. These players, man, swear to God, don't need the team playing like

625
03:59:44,540 --> 04:00:28,180
fucking bronze players. Dr. Clay, throw my shares in the air wherever they land is where they will

626
04:00:28,180 --> 04:00:39,500
go. Oh, what the fuck, dude? 12345678910. They all landed on Splatoon. That's weird. Heads. Heads.

627
04:00:39,500 --> 04:00:47,479
Whoa. That one landed on its edge, which I'll put that to Breath of the Wild. That's fair.

628
04:00:48,360 --> 04:00:52,059
All right. Pay fucking attention to the game. You moron. What am I doing? I'm like,

629
04:00:52,059 --> 04:01:37,239
I'm away from the entire team. Oh, my. Get this thing away from. Why is it attacking me

630
04:01:37,239 --> 04:01:39,879
of all the people? There's four of us here. Why is it attacking me?

631
04:01:40,840 --> 04:01:45,559
Why do I have all the aggro of every single enemy in the whole entire map?

632
04:01:54,200 --> 04:01:57,879
We all did it. I wasn't the only one. I wasn't the only one. I wasn't the only one.

633
04:02:21,690 --> 04:02:31,459
We're good. This is we're doing it. I actually really don't like this weapon.

634
04:02:32,100 --> 04:04:23,750
But that was a little snail thing. Oh, activate. Oh, shit. We did 20 out of eight. We kind of

635
04:04:23,750 --> 04:04:37,719
cleaned up there. We lost a player. Mandatory overtime is an egg cannon. Get to work.

636
04:04:37,719 --> 04:05:04,059
Somebody else use that. I don't know what that does. That was stupid. What he took. He blew up

637
04:05:04,059 --> 04:05:10,299
the entire map. We all die instantly. He kills everybody and you can't get away.

638
04:05:10,299 --> 04:05:20,260
What are you supposed to do? What are you supposed to do? We lost a player.

639
04:05:20,899 --> 04:05:40,149
I'm going to do Breath of the Wild. Is Breath of the Wild canceled? I just want to know because

640
04:05:40,149 --> 04:05:59,030
it's late here and I want to leave. Shit. People want to see Breath of the Wild. All right. All

641
04:05:59,030 --> 04:06:14,540
right. All right. All right. I'm going to extend the switch in on Sunday. Here's what's going to

642
04:06:14,540 --> 04:06:20,889
happen. Are you ready? Listen to me. I want to all the shareholders need to listen. I was going

643
04:06:20,889 --> 04:06:28,010
to do like a half Breath of the Wild stream, half Splatoon stream today, and I didn't do that.

644
04:06:28,010 --> 04:06:32,969
But I'm doing Splatoon right now. But you know what that means? Listen to me shareholders.

645
04:06:33,610 --> 04:06:37,209
That means that it will be an entire stream of Breath of the Wild on Sunday.

646
04:06:40,520 --> 04:06:49,850
I was going to leave the switch on Sunday. Are we OK with that compromise? What the hell is this?

647
04:06:49,850 --> 04:06:59,700
Why? Can I get a vote? Can we get a shareholders vote, please? Are you OK with Sunday being an

648
04:06:59,700 --> 04:07:54,340
entire day of Breath of the Wild? Not a thing. Splatoon on Sunday too. No. We're kind of going

649
04:07:54,340 --> 04:08:48,520
fracked out here. 23. OK. What are these new enemies? Shoot it in the mouth? Booyah, booyah,

650
04:08:48,520 --> 04:09:15,209
booyah. Oh my goodness. That's a lot. I don't understand this one. How does this one work?

651
04:09:56,709 --> 04:10:12,709
Breath of the Wild 82 percent. What? Only 1400 shareholders. What's going on?

652
04:10:20,780 --> 04:11:01,129
This was for all. This was for Sunday. OK. How's that? Not hitting you. Oh, we're way far away.

653
04:11:26,600 --> 04:11:53,719
Oh, I'm bad. We're good. Will you land already? Dude, why wouldn't that thing land? Yeah,

654
04:11:53,719 --> 04:11:57,719
we'll do a full Breath of the Wild stream on Sunday. That makes more sense to me.

655
04:11:57,719 --> 04:12:08,790
I may have been going for four hours, four and a half hours or so. Am I going to go to

656
04:12:08,790 --> 04:12:13,959
Breath of the Wild for like an hour and 45 minutes, two hours? We'll do a full six to

657
04:12:13,959 --> 04:12:41,899
seven hour stream on Sunday. Breath of the Wild. Oh, all right. Frank up. Are you going to complete

658
04:12:41,899 --> 04:12:56,120
Breath of the Wild? I don't know. I'm going to play it until it's no longer fun for me,

659
04:12:56,120 --> 04:13:16,819
which maybe I'll beat the whole thing. You postpone Breath of the Wild twice. You're doing

660
04:13:16,819 --> 04:13:30,940
it a third time. Breath of the Wild is the last thing I streamed before this. Who remembers

661
04:13:30,940 --> 04:13:38,579
the Omega Weekend? Hey, Omega Weekend. I streamed for 14 hours in a row. That's the longest stream

662
04:13:38,659 --> 04:13:45,219
I've ever done. I am going to say on the record that that was an Omega Weekend. That was literally

663
04:13:45,219 --> 04:13:49,459
a 14 hour stream. I don't do those. I will never do one of those ever again. That was an Omega

664
04:13:49,459 --> 04:13:55,879
Weekend. Hey, you went to sleep and woke up and I was still streaming. I didn't do that. I stayed

665
04:13:55,879 --> 04:14:38,760
up. That's an Omega Weekend. It was an Omega Friday. It was Omega Friday night and then we

666
04:14:38,760 --> 04:14:48,090
were at Omega Saturday morning. Friday, Saturday and then I streamed on Sunday. I streamed on Sunday.

667
04:14:48,809 --> 04:14:52,260
You don't remember that. You're remembering Omega Weekend wrong.

668
04:14:52,979 --> 04:15:18,899
How are we all trying to do the same fucking thing? What's raining? Get the shit out of here.

669
04:15:18,899 --> 04:15:47,940
Sorry. The oil game took up 80% of your Omega Weekend. So? No, it didn't. I was streaming for

670
04:15:47,940 --> 04:16:23,299
like eight or nine hours before I did that. Holy shit. That would have just wiped us all out.

671
04:16:23,860 --> 04:16:40,549
Someone's talking shit. Hey, come on. It's Groggy Gary. You guys don't mean that. Come on. It's

672
04:16:40,549 --> 04:17:15,500
Groggy Gary here. What are you? Hey, shit. This is bad. Oh, fuck. That's going to kill us all.

673
04:17:23,209 --> 04:17:36,780
No, I want to rescue you. How do I rescue this person? Oh, that's not the final round. Shit.

674
04:17:37,579 --> 04:17:40,219
I thought that was, I don't know why my brain thought that was the last one. That's all right.

675
04:17:41,020 --> 04:19:15,000
Where is he? Got it. Where is everybody? Oh, oh my God. Who's alive? I don't even know where they

676
04:19:15,000 --> 04:19:36,920
are. We get it. Ah, thank God. He's still playing Splatoon. I thought he was going to play Breath

677
04:19:36,920 --> 04:20:10,360
of the Wild. Oh, my Breath of the Wild got a virus. It was tragic. Yeah. Yeah. I was downloading

678
04:20:11,239 --> 04:20:29,260
funny mods and I, I don't know. I crashed it. It sucks, dude. I don't know what I did, but every

679
04:20:29,260 --> 04:20:35,559
time I opened Breath of the Wild, it starts playing the music and maybe somebody can help.

680
04:20:35,559 --> 04:20:44,739
It starts going like, and I have to like hold the power, but I have to unplug this quick.

681
04:20:45,700 --> 04:21:04,459
All right. I got to pay attention. We're in the big leagues now.

682
04:21:20,649 --> 04:22:05,670
Thank you. Where's the boss? Oh my God. That thing's lasered. All right. It's over here.

683
04:22:05,670 --> 04:22:37,510
I get it. I got it. No, I didn't. Where is it? Have I not picked it up? What drugs is this guy

684
04:22:37,510 --> 04:23:13,930
character on? I, I couldn't pick it up. I was trying to pick it up. What did I think? Actually,

685
04:23:13,930 --> 04:24:20,329
I think I just did that drill. Let's work low end UFO. Oh my goodness. What a fucking play.

686
04:24:20,329 --> 04:24:58,940
That was all right. This is it. This is the, I got to really be in the front lines because this

687
04:24:58,940 --> 04:25:39,450
weapon is seriously like, I can't, I cannot mess around. What is it? Oh, drill. We all right.

688
04:25:39,450 --> 04:26:09,129
Somebody disconnect. Oh my God. What's happening over here? Oh my God, dude. We, well, we lost a

689
04:26:09,129 --> 04:26:46,180
player. I can't. What was I doing? Oh my God. I kept on falling down. I was hovering and falling,

690
04:26:46,180 --> 04:27:02,709
hovering and falling. We still won. Oh, look at whatever. 51 eggs. That's a lot. We lost a player.

691
04:27:02,709 --> 04:27:34,920
That wasn't fair. Almost there. Another hat. You lost viewers. No, sorry. Those viewers are just,

692
04:27:34,920 --> 04:27:39,579
they now know they have a day or two to prepare. So they're going to order the like 10 foot long

693
04:27:39,579 --> 04:27:44,760
subway sandwich and have a party when I do the Breath of the Wild stream on Sunday. They're

694
04:27:44,760 --> 04:27:50,889
just preparing. They just got to go and figure out what they're going to do. I want one of those

695
04:27:50,889 --> 04:28:11,479
right now. I could probably eat the whole thing. I don't know. I don't think I would stop eating it.

696
04:28:12,200 --> 04:28:19,020
If you got me like a cheese steak, like a six foot long cheese steak, and it was just like, oh hey,

697
04:28:19,020 --> 04:28:22,620
by the way, like no, no one else is going to eat this. Like you can have it. I'd be like,

698
04:28:23,739 --> 04:28:50,729
really? I'd probably eat the whole thing. My goodness. You take care of it. You got it.

699
04:28:51,450 --> 04:29:43,129
Oh, shit. All right. We're good. Just stay alive. We're good. We're good. We don't have to get

700
04:29:43,770 --> 04:30:07,030
anything more than the quarter. That's fine. Yeah. Nice cheese steak. Oh, play Stardew Valley. Um,

701
04:30:07,590 --> 04:30:12,280
I played that a long time ago. Ice cream. That was like one of my first things I did on Twitch.

702
04:31:01,479 --> 04:31:34,899
Mom, yeah. Oh, come to me. Walk to me. Walk to me. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up.

703
04:31:34,899 --> 04:31:52,020
That's 20. You've been more than 20. We're good. You're throwing on purpose. We just got 23

704
04:31:52,020 --> 04:32:19,479
globs. You strike me as a Disney mom. Open, open, open, open, open, open. Good start. Good start.

705
04:32:20,200 --> 04:33:19,299
Need some help over here. Good start. Oh, shit. Thank you. There's so much over here. Dude,

706
04:33:19,299 --> 04:33:24,419
who even hit me? You don't even fucking lagging. I lagged out. Lag. I just lagged out.

707
04:33:25,139 --> 04:33:48,099
Fuck it. I'm doing it. Somebody put these in. Somebody put these in. Somebody put them in.

708
04:33:48,819 --> 04:34:04,950
All right. We got 22. All right. How do I not die from this thing? How do I not die from this?

709
04:34:08,180 --> 04:34:24,919
Just get the fuck out of the way. I'm out of the way. I'm getting out of the way.

710
04:34:25,479 --> 04:35:04,180
I'm out of the way. Where is he? This is hitting. I'm going to be a grenade, Andy. Where's the person

711
04:35:04,180 --> 04:35:06,340
that's died? I got you. I got you. I got you. I got you. Come here. Come here. Come here.

712
04:35:21,740 --> 04:35:23,900
Keep on the lookout for other monsters.

713
04:35:51,880 --> 04:36:01,880
You throw the golden eggs at it and oh, I didn't know that. So close. So close. You throw the eggs

714
04:36:01,880 --> 04:36:26,540
at 60 eggs. I hold on. Excuse me. I ate your sub order last week. It was mid. Sorry. What's my

715
04:36:26,540 --> 04:36:42,229
sub order? It was mid. What's my sub order? It was mid. It was mid. A C? Like a C plus? That's

716
04:36:42,229 --> 04:36:47,689
fucking fine. Mid I guess. It's like a medium. It's like mid. That means it's okay. That means

717
04:36:47,689 --> 04:36:54,759
it's good. That means you didn't dislike it. You thought it was okay. So what? It was a meatball

718
04:36:54,759 --> 04:37:10,419
sub? You're a fucking boomer. Mid means bad. To me, mid means like middle of the road. That was

719
04:37:10,419 --> 04:37:27,500
mid. That was middle. That was like a C. It does mean that. But what are we complaining about?

720
04:37:31,930 --> 04:37:35,049
You said that my sub order was like a medium on the scale of how good something was?

721
04:37:35,849 --> 04:37:42,439
That's all right. You could have said it sucked. You could have said, hey dude, your sub order is

722
04:37:42,439 --> 04:38:04,299
dog shit. I know. I understand that. Medium. Okay. That's all right. All right. I don't even know

723
04:38:04,299 --> 04:38:31,180
what the order is though. That was a good grenade. Holy shit. Nice work. Thank you.

724
04:38:39,939 --> 04:39:00,180
Oh, that's a shitty place for that to be. We got to get at least the two zero, right?

725
04:39:03,029 --> 04:39:17,080
Yeah. But what was the order? Was it the meatball sub? I mean a meatball sub is not my order. It's

726
04:39:17,080 --> 04:39:37,979
one of a handful of a lot of sandwiches I like to eat. It's a griller. I got you. I got you. I got

727
04:39:37,979 --> 04:40:47,540
you. Come to me. And one of the mods tell me what sandwich it was. Two grillers. God damn it. It

728
04:40:47,619 --> 04:41:06,729
was the meatball sub. Oh my God. Who cares? We did it. Okay. First of all,

729
04:41:07,529 --> 04:41:15,509
a meatball sub is by very definition a mid sandwich. That's not a bad thing.

730
04:41:18,200 --> 04:41:51,240
Final wave. Okay. We'll get it. Hold on. Got it. Oh my God. All right. He's my ultimate, ultimate,

731
04:41:51,240 --> 04:42:42,099
ultimate, ultimate. Anybody alive? Dude, I just saved us all. Holy shit. 30. Are you kidding me?

732
04:43:03,220 --> 04:43:12,099
That was a lot. Okay. So what I was saying is a meatball sub is a very basic kind of

733
04:43:12,099 --> 04:43:20,009
generic sandwich. It is mid by it's on its own. It is mid by default. I like meatball subs. I think

734
04:43:20,009 --> 04:43:32,150
they're great. A little bit provolone. That's it. I asked you in the slime rancher stream. That's

735
04:43:32,150 --> 04:43:53,189
what you answered. It depends on the day. Let me get to the next rank and then I'll do the other

736
04:43:53,189 --> 04:44:05,349
game mode. Meatball subs are good. Yeah, I know. What's the problem? If you want to know what my,

737
04:44:05,349 --> 04:44:09,990
one of my favorite sub sandwiches is. Okay. A cheesesteak, like a Philly cheesesteak

738
04:44:10,790 --> 04:44:19,459
with grilled onions on it and a shitload of mayo. Ew. Quiet. That's up there pretty high.

739
04:44:23,849 --> 04:44:31,979
A chicken cutlet sandwich, chicken cutlet, lettuce, tomato, fresh chicken cutlet. Holy shit.

740
04:44:34,889 --> 04:45:02,860
Not much is better than that. Mayo, mayo. Gross. If you do not understand that mayo can seriously

741
04:45:02,860 --> 04:45:07,860
bring out a bunch of delicious flavors and everything else, I just, I don't know what to

742
04:45:07,860 --> 04:45:21,419
tell you. A chicken cutlet sandwich with lettuce, tomato, mayo. I need, I detailed answer of how

743
04:45:21,419 --> 04:45:27,400
that doesn't taste fantastic. It's, I don't get, I don't get you. All right. I'm just shooting in

744
04:45:27,400 --> 04:45:35,799
the air. I gotta play. Oh my God. I thought I actually got that. That would be amazing.

745
04:45:46,200 --> 04:46:21,459
Deliver. Sorry. Let me get that last one. Sorry. Um, give it a try. Japanese mayo. Yes. It's

746
04:46:21,459 --> 04:46:38,439
incredible. But you know what beats everything? I can't get these out here. I mean, I can,

747
04:46:38,439 --> 04:47:09,669
I kinda can. I don't even want to talk about it. I seriously don't. Don't touch those. Oh my God. I

748
04:47:09,669 --> 04:47:16,250
look like I just installed the game five minutes ago. Oh my God. I didn't, I promise I didn't just

749
04:47:50,139 --> 04:48:05,220
just use this button thing. How did that not kill it? How did that not kill it? How did that not

750
04:48:05,220 --> 04:48:12,409
kill it? No, that doesn't count. Let's talk about fucking like cream cheese and mayonnaise on a

751
04:48:12,409 --> 04:48:30,169
sandwich. What's your Starbucks order? A venti cold brew with a little bit of oat milk or almond milk

752
04:48:30,169 --> 04:48:51,979
and then three pumps of toffee nut. Get on my level. Oh, the sandwich I was talking about. Okay.

753
04:48:53,400 --> 04:49:09,020
Have you guys ever had a buffalo chicken sub? Oh my God. Yeah. Yeah, man. I'm so pissed. I've,

754
04:49:09,819 --> 04:49:15,340
they don't really like exist out here. You, they kind of do, but not like it is on the East coast.

755
04:49:15,340 --> 04:49:43,669
Oh my goodness. There's so much better. Thanks. You got it. I have good.

756
04:50:54,599 --> 04:51:03,590
Crispy chicken, not grilled chicken, crispy chicken, buffalo sub, blue cheese on it. Oh my God.

757
04:51:09,979 --> 04:51:18,220
And I'm talking, I'm talking a joke worth of blue cheese. Whatever you think I'm talking about.

758
04:51:18,220 --> 04:52:13,979
It's like a joke. Add more like you're doing a joke. Nice job. Nice job. Somebody's hurt,

759
04:52:13,979 --> 04:53:04,229
but that's going to hurt. Oh shit. What happened here? That acted like mold and blue cheese is

760
04:53:04,229 --> 04:53:07,830
disgusting. Yet would happily eat something like yogurt, which is live cultured bacteria.

761
04:53:07,830 --> 04:53:18,060
It don't drink alcohol anymore. You don't, don't drink alcohol. Don't have kombucha. Don't have

762
04:53:18,060 --> 04:54:00,180
kimchi. Don't eat that. I don't want any hypocrite Andes in here. Start. I can't see you.

763
04:54:05,639 --> 04:54:34,659
Oh my God. What just happened? I think that guy. Thank you. Oh my God. What is happening? What's

764
04:54:34,659 --> 04:55:28,549
this? The whole map just turned green. I'm going to play too. I did pretty bad that run.

765
04:55:28,549 --> 04:55:39,400
Really bad that run. Um, but anyways, yeah. You know what else is awesome? A nice just

766
04:55:40,220 --> 04:55:47,979
Turkey sandwich, Turkey lettuce. You know what else is awesome? Just a bunch of wilted up spinach

767
04:55:47,979 --> 04:56:02,200
in a pan. This garlic sauteed lemon juice, a little bit of a little bit of salt. Oh my God.

768
04:56:02,200 --> 04:56:41,029
Eat it. So insane. Saturday coming in for that cloud. Oh, I thought the helicopter was a fucking

769
04:56:41,029 --> 04:57:16,229
bad guy. I'm staying up here. Yep. Come over. Come on. Eat that. Why can we not kill this thing?

770
04:57:16,869 --> 04:57:38,869
Just leave it. Leave it. Leave it. This is bad. Did I get you? Oh my God. I threw it in the ocean.

771
04:57:39,830 --> 04:58:17,500
I don't. Do you know what else is really good? This might actually be the thing I want to do

772
04:58:17,500 --> 04:58:27,909
tonight. Pasta. Spaghetti. Angel hair. Get that shit al dente. Like eight, nine minutes. Maybe

773
04:58:27,909 --> 04:58:39,529
like a little bit. I thought I could deseed. Something in my eye. Get it al dente. Shit load

774
04:58:39,529 --> 04:58:46,169
of like a good, a good high quality olive oil. Dump, like dump the cup smothered in olive oil.

775
04:58:49,060 --> 04:59:25,779
Salt. Done. Did I get it in? Angel hair sucks. Thank you. I'm going to quit the game.

776
04:59:26,419 --> 05:00:11,639
I got it. You weren't dead. I wasn't. I thought I was dead. All right. This is it. Final wave.

777
05:00:12,279 --> 05:00:43,189
Over here. I'll do the turning. I'll do the turning. I'll do the turning. I'll do the turning.

778
05:00:43,909 --> 05:01:44,099
What's happening? What's happening? Oh, what do you mean low ink? It's full. It's actually full.

779
05:01:45,060 --> 05:01:53,430
You knocked me out. I swear to God. I, I couldn't throw the, I just fucking throw the goddamn thing.

780
05:01:54,069 --> 05:02:11,319
We win. Oh, all right. Let's actually do it this time. I understand how it works.

781
05:02:12,119 --> 05:02:30,119
Give me some boost me, boost me, boost me, boost me, boost me, boost me, boost me, boost me.

782
05:02:30,919 --> 05:02:53,849
What happened? What happened? Get the fuck out of my way. Oh my God. This is so frustrating.

783
05:02:54,729 --> 05:03:32,090
We have so many things to throw. Where's this big bird? Dude, I can't, man. It's just, there's,

784
05:03:32,169 --> 05:03:51,290
I can't, you can't even see what's happening. Throw the eggs. Dude, I can't throw the eggs

785
05:03:51,849 --> 05:03:56,090
when I'm being puked on by 5,000 different enemies. They're all like,

786
05:03:57,049 --> 05:04:04,250
stun lock, stun, stun, stun lock, stun lock. I can't even see. Dude, that's one of those

787
05:04:04,250 --> 05:04:08,099
encounters that you have to be in a fucking vent call. You're going to be in a discord call to

788
05:04:08,099 --> 05:04:15,020
even do that. It's going to be like, corner, corner, corner. Go, go, go, go. Yep. Like we

789
05:04:15,020 --> 05:04:19,959
have to be all be yelling at each other. You're going to be in vent yelling at each other.

790
05:04:19,959 --> 05:04:42,819
It's the only way that works. You'd get on vent. I'm going in, going in, going in. Okay.

791
05:04:43,939 --> 05:04:58,810
I'm there, I'm there, I'm there. Remember that? My voice is just gone too. What happened today?

792
05:05:03,020 --> 05:05:09,900
You have so many hats. Do I have way too many hats? Should I go look at them?

793
05:05:19,110 --> 05:05:33,540
30 hats. What about Breath of the Wild? I'm borrowing my friend's Switch today.

794
05:05:34,500 --> 05:05:37,540
We decided because he wanted to play Breath of the Wild for this weekend.

795
05:05:39,139 --> 05:05:43,220
I want to play Splatoon and he had Splatoon and I had Breath of the Wild so we traded

796
05:05:43,220 --> 05:05:58,299
switches for a weekend. I'll get it back. It's so fucking annoying though. His Switch is wicked

797
05:05:58,299 --> 05:06:15,459
greasy. It's like stains all over the shoulder, fingers. Get me up here. I can't even play the

798
05:06:15,459 --> 05:06:28,459
game. This is just shitty place. Okay. What happened? It's already explained what happened

799
05:06:28,459 --> 05:06:58,439
right here. What did we all just get such shit on? Thank you. Dude, I can't, I have to leave.

800
05:07:06,500 --> 05:07:14,680
Oh, time to join vent. Left square bracket, right square bracket, left square bracket, right square

801
05:07:14,680 --> 05:07:19,639
bracket, left square bracket, right square bracket, left square bracket, right square bracket, left

802
05:07:19,639 --> 05:07:31,700
square bracket, right square bracket, left square bracket, live have left the channel. Oh, come on.

803
05:07:40,139 --> 05:07:47,180
You're so bad at this game. I'm currently in the overachiever level and I'm not invent and

804
05:07:47,180 --> 05:07:51,979
it's my first time, first day ever playing Splatoon and I've got my friend's greasy ass

805
05:07:51,979 --> 05:08:03,860
Switch in my hand. It's got a huge crack down the middle. You can clearly tell that it was next to

806
05:08:04,419 --> 05:08:11,639
his bed. He got wicked tired and put it down over there in the middle of a Diablo 2 remastered

807
05:08:11,639 --> 05:08:16,549
session and he got up in the morning and he didn't know it was there and he stepped on it with his

808
05:08:16,549 --> 05:08:30,119
heel and cracked the screen. I actually did that to my iPad, except replace Diablo 2 remastered

809
05:08:31,180 --> 05:09:10,580
with a cookie run kingdom or something. I don't know. Over here. I'm a team player.

810
05:09:11,139 --> 05:10:00,099
You just got to get in the way. Don't even run into me. Oh, yeah. Don't even run into me. You

811
05:10:00,099 --> 05:10:25,860
puke stain. Don't die. Fuck. We're going to get demoted again. I think we got really far.

812
05:10:25,860 --> 05:10:31,159
We're all hitting gamer fatigue. We're hitting gamer fatigue and that's what's going on.

813
05:10:31,159 --> 05:10:38,970
I've been playing with the same players for like an hour. It's gamer fatigue. It's all right.

814
05:10:39,770 --> 05:11:17,930
We'll be fine. I'll go back to turf war. What's that? So I should swap for chunks. What about

815
05:11:17,930 --> 05:11:47,240
this? Which one's better? Up to you. What am I looking at here? Keep it. Is it better? Run

816
05:11:47,240 --> 05:12:10,709
speed up. But I don't know. Keep this. That's a triple. That's a triple right there. Where's

817
05:12:10,709 --> 05:12:25,130
the triple? Didn't I just get a triple? Are you telling me that's all I got? We're playing that

818
05:12:25,130 --> 05:12:46,139
game mode for two hours. I got 18 cents. I got 18 copper. All right. Let's do some other regular

819
05:12:46,139 --> 05:12:59,159
game mode. Do I want to stay with this loadout? I think I'm okay with this. I don't think I

820
05:12:59,159 --> 05:13:22,409
unlocked anything though. Yeah, I'll stay with this. This works. How much longer are you going

821
05:13:22,409 --> 05:13:28,709
to stream for it? I don't know. Maybe like another 45 minutes hour. I'll get to like six plus hours

822
05:13:28,709 --> 05:13:54,729
or so and then we'll be back on Sunday with a breath of the wild. Play the card game. I wonder

823
05:13:54,729 --> 05:14:23,590
how much better I'll be at this mode now that I played that much. New map though. Where you at?

824
05:14:31,080 --> 05:15:27,590
What are your thoughts on the game? It is a 9.9. Oh, at least I got it. That's going to be huge.

825
05:15:27,590 --> 05:16:12,470
It's a 9.9, 9.8, 8.7, 7.5, 8.5. Sorry. I got a little weird. I might need to recalibrate.

826
05:16:13,349 --> 05:16:47,380
Oh, you're in the enemy base. Let's go. It's all right. I think we still win. They're not going to

827
05:16:48,200 --> 05:17:34,090
take this all the way back, are they? No. All right. Read my lips. What am I saying?

828
05:17:34,090 --> 05:17:58,419
Yeah, let's go. Do the gumball machine. I probably can't be in a lobby. There's no way this isn't a

829
05:17:58,419 --> 05:18:07,659
bit. What? Top fragging in Splatoon 3 and being the best player on the team. What's happening?

830
05:18:07,659 --> 05:19:23,610
Where is everybody? Where is everybody? Where's their team? Can we get up there? Oh, that sucks.

831
05:19:23,610 --> 05:20:04,520
I got it actually up in their spawn. I'm confused. Where is everybody? Got to wrap around real quick.

832
05:20:04,520 --> 05:21:43,110
Number one turf anchor, number one super jump spot and number one ground traveler. Play the

833
05:21:43,110 --> 05:21:50,840
card game. I feel like I'm just getting good at this. All right. Three more rounds with this

834
05:21:50,840 --> 05:22:14,619
weapon and then I'm going to change weapons. You ever going to play this again? It's really fun.

835
05:22:15,180 --> 05:22:24,680
I don't see why not. I just didn't get it. It's kind of like how I felt about Dark Souls before

836
05:22:24,680 --> 05:22:42,020
I actually understood what it was. Try ranked. I don't know if I'm going to do ranked today.

837
05:22:42,740 --> 05:23:36,919
This is a huge map. Don't you dare. Don't you dare. I hit every single button. I hit every

838
05:23:37,639 --> 05:24:14,580
single button, but the right one. I didn't know how to detonate it. I forgot. Oh,

839
05:24:15,619 --> 05:25:26,250
did I do that? That shit out of here. Come on down. Come on down. Come on down. First time

840
05:25:26,250 --> 05:25:59,209
I've had the whole game. There we go. That's a win. There's no way I fell asleep and you're

841
05:25:59,209 --> 05:26:05,990
still playing Splatoon. Have you even seen Sam and Run yet? Like Sam and the Food? What's that

842
05:26:05,990 --> 05:26:56,090
person talking about? Sam and the Food? I like it. How do you do that? Let's go. I'm going to do

843
05:26:56,090 --> 05:27:20,869
weapon change after this. This is the third one. See if I can unlock anything new. Bro, don't make

844
05:27:20,869 --> 05:27:38,599
me get up there. Secure the kill. God damn it. Secure the kill. I thought there was somebody

845
05:27:38,599 --> 05:28:38,340
next to me. There is. Oh, I walked into it. Surprise. We just doubled. Hell yeah. Oh, okay.

846
05:28:38,340 --> 05:30:11,799
Nice cheating. See you. That's a win. Oh, no, it's not. It's not. What happened? They had their

847
05:30:13,159 --> 05:30:30,619
mecha thing. All right, we're going to do a different weapon. New weapon. That was a good

848
05:30:30,619 --> 05:31:11,930
fight. That was actually a good match. Sword Andy, what do you think? Would you recommend this game?

849
05:31:11,930 --> 05:31:22,840
Yes, a hundred percent. In my mind, this was a six, but in reality, it's at least an eight.

850
05:32:28,729 --> 05:32:33,450
I fucked up. I fucked up. My fingers got locked up with the gamer fatigue for like six hours.

851
05:32:33,450 --> 05:33:31,000
Gamer fatigue. I got locked up. Shit, I got a direct hit too. Oh my God, we're getting destroyed.

852
05:33:31,000 --> 05:33:53,110
This is a domination. I switch weapons. Look what happens. I switch weapons. Look what happens.

853
05:33:53,110 --> 05:34:30,069
This thing's junk. I don't know where anybody is. Is it weird that the orange and purple

854
05:34:30,069 --> 05:34:35,180
fucked with my head? It makes it hard for me to play. I feel like it's hard for me to see

855
05:34:35,180 --> 05:34:53,720
what's going on. Anybody else like that? You're going to join the Valorant scene? No, dude, never.

856
05:34:53,720 --> 05:35:23,459
No way. I want to buy a new weapon. Thanks, junk. You look unhinged today. God, I want a Buffalo

857
05:35:23,459 --> 05:35:39,909
chicken sub so bad. All right, so what do we got? This is the better roller. Should I try the umbrella?

858
05:35:39,909 --> 05:36:17,740
No, you know what? Let's try this. This thing seems pretty cool. It seems to have pretty good

859
05:36:17,740 --> 05:36:53,909
spread. All right, so what's this do? Press R? Wait, what's going on? What is this? It slows

860
05:36:53,909 --> 05:37:05,720
down. Oh, that's kind of good. Oh, that's who does that move. All right. Okay, let's try it.

861
05:37:05,720 --> 05:37:36,439
Make some blues ink. Wrong button. Get some outfits so you don't look like a lame librarian.

862
05:37:36,439 --> 05:38:19,580
It's a new outfit. I've had it for like an hour. So this thing, the target rises up. Kind of weird.

863
05:38:19,580 --> 05:38:27,259
While you hold the button down, your cursor goes up. Where's that weapon? That thing looks cool.

864
05:38:27,259 --> 05:39:39,740
A chainsaw? I don't know about this. I don't know about this. It takes too long. This thing

865
05:39:39,740 --> 05:40:48,490
sucks ass. This is the worst weapon in the whole game. I'm fucking glad I used a Willy Wonka

866
05:40:48,490 --> 05:42:26,939
ticket on this piece of shit. F here. This is what I'm talking about. This is a real weapon.

867
05:42:26,939 --> 05:42:56,919
All right, let's do it. So are they ink or are they squids? What are they? We just came

868
05:42:56,919 --> 05:43:38,810
out of a box. That was a good start. Use the vending machine. All right. After this match,

869
05:43:38,810 --> 05:43:54,869
I'm going to go spend some money. Can you do a dab, please? It's a 2017. What do you want

870
05:43:54,869 --> 05:44:49,750
me to do a dab? There's two people there. I would have won. They're grouping. They're grouping.

871
05:44:49,750 --> 05:44:54,419
They're on a vent call. They're in a vent call. They're all in a vent call. They queued up his

872
05:44:54,419 --> 05:45:49,750
party. Land. Come on, land. I really don't like that super. I think it's terrible. Oh,

873
05:45:49,750 --> 05:46:44,439
you're so dead, man. I think we're getting kind of killed here. Oh, come on. Dude, where? I

874
05:46:45,479 --> 05:47:04,549
can't see. Gamer fatigue. It's over. It's over. We lose. It's over. It's over. It was over when

875
05:47:04,549 --> 05:47:39,689
it began. It was over. They were all in a fucking vent call. All right, one more and then I'm going

876
05:47:39,689 --> 05:48:25,740
to go buy stuff. You almost lost a 4v3. The word you're looking for there is almost. All right,

877
05:48:25,740 --> 05:48:42,259
I'm going to put my pants on for this one. I'm just not comfortable. You know what I mean?

878
05:49:01,580 --> 05:49:04,540
Oh, I thought I was going to sneak behind and get everybody. That would have been insane.

879
05:49:04,540 --> 05:49:39,029
Sometimes he says something that bypasses his brain. What do you mean? Stay alive. Stay alive.

880
05:49:39,029 --> 05:49:50,900
Stay alive. Stay alive. Stay alive. Oh, this is bad. Come on. Come on. To me. To me. To me. To me.

881
05:50:08,709 --> 05:50:53,959
Hey, did I explode in the mech? Oh, where'd you even come from? Hacker. I'm sorry. I keep

882
05:50:53,959 --> 05:52:06,700
screaming into the mic. Come here, you little shit. Hacker. Oh, no, it wasn't

883
05:52:06,700 --> 05:52:10,869
a hacker. I'm just kidding. I'm just got angry at the video game and I decided to call.

884
05:52:10,869 --> 05:52:23,259
Just yell out something. Oh, I got a license. OK. All right. I'm going to buy clothes. Let's

885
05:52:23,259 --> 05:52:30,310
head back to the clothing shop. I want to see what's here and then I'm going to do one more game.

886
05:52:30,310 --> 05:52:35,380
I'll do the gumball machine. I'll do this. I'll do one more game. Then I'm going to end the stream.

887
05:52:35,380 --> 05:53:18,470
It's a good time. Same clothes as before. The shoes different. No. Cool. How do I get to my locker

888
05:53:18,470 --> 05:53:41,209
in the lobby? Right. How does this work? Five thousand. It's a cool 30,000. What are you

889
05:53:41,209 --> 05:54:07,560
kidding me? Where's my where's my locker in here? There's a locker room over here.

890
05:54:07,560 --> 05:56:30,580
What the fuck happened? It cancels literally everything if you press B. Minimalist style.

891
05:56:30,580 --> 05:56:56,229
All right. Last one is the last one and then I'm done. I'll see you guys on Sunday.

892
05:56:56,229 --> 05:57:00,069
Yeah, we'll do. I know I'm supposed to play Breath of the Wild today, but I didn't.

893
05:57:00,069 --> 05:57:07,430
We'll do a full Breath of the Wild stream on Sunday. But when you have fun, you don't want

894
05:57:07,430 --> 05:57:21,909
to get up. Have a good time. Just keep playing. Oh, this is a lot of water.

895
05:57:22,389 --> 05:59:49,900
Oh, this is a lot of water. I forgot to hit the jump button. No, I hit a big oh. Holy shit.

896
05:59:49,900 --> 06:00:44,439
Boom. Kid got this game for their birthday, dude. What the fuck? So did I. All right. That's

897
06:00:44,439 --> 06:00:50,180
a good one to go out on. That's a good one to go out on. They weren't. Look, the teams weren't that

898
06:00:50,180 --> 06:01:00,490
bad. Six hundred five seventy two. Oh, this game's great. This is a I highly recommend it. Very fun.

899
06:01:01,049 --> 06:01:12,810
Very fun. And that's it. I'll see you later. See you on Sunday. I'll see you later, guys.

900
06:01:15,240 --> 06:01:21,380
Sunday, we're going to do Breath of the Wild and we might finish it out with some split two and three.

901
06:01:21,380 --> 06:01:41,930
It's possible. You never know. I'm very surprised. I will tell you for real. I did not think I was

902
06:01:41,930 --> 06:01:50,790
going to like this game at all. I thought it was going to be kind of fun, but then it was really

903
06:01:50,790 --> 06:02:09,479
fun. Breath of the Wild should be fun, too. I'm looking forward to it. These Nintendo games have

904
06:02:09,479 --> 06:02:29,349
been been on point. I haven't had a complaint so far. If I do that salmon run thing again,

905
06:02:29,349 --> 06:02:42,299
I definitely want to do with other people. Those later levels, you 100 percent need communication.

906
06:02:42,299 --> 06:02:53,819
Somebody's got eyes on something at some point during the entire game. You need that skill issue.

907
06:02:53,819 --> 06:02:56,459
Yeah. Well, if I play with three other people or two or three other people,

908
06:02:56,459 --> 06:02:59,180
then there won't be a skill issue. We'll have communication. That's a skill.

909
06:02:59,180 --> 06:03:17,450
I'll see you later, guys. Have a good rest of your night. Have a good weekend. See you on Sunday.

910
06:03:17,450 --> 06:03:52,470
Call your mother. See you later.
