Hello everybody, welcome to episode 10 of Germacraft.

2
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:16,940
Sorry it's been about a week since I last... Oh my god, a wolf!

3
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:22,390
What do I do? Oh my god! Oh my god, he's mad! He's mad!

4
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:26,820
No! Get away from me! I didn't want to have to come to this!

5
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:32,259
Oh, I'm sorry Mr. Wolf. I did not mean to kill you.

6
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:36,570
But anyways, we're in the Forest of Wondrous Secrets.

7
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:41,109
Or something like that, I have no idea. But let's just keep going here.

8
00:00:41,109 --> 00:00:48,460
I'm going to... What is this? What the hell is this?

9
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:55,929
What? Who built the castle? Oh my god.

10
00:00:55,929 --> 00:01:01,130
Grandpa! Need to talk to you! Get down here! What? What the hell?

11
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:05,129
Did you build... What the hell is this? It's a castle. What is this?

12
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:09,129
It's a castle! You can't see that with your own eyes, you stupid! Hold on, you built a castle?

13
00:01:09,129 --> 00:01:13,129
Yes. You... It was fucking easy! You have a moat? How the hell did you get this?

14
00:01:13,129 --> 00:01:17,129
It took me like ten minutes. Does the bridge come down? No, it doesn't.

15
00:01:17,129 --> 00:01:21,129
It's just for show. Are you friggin' kidding me? How did you do this so fast?

16
00:01:21,129 --> 00:01:25,129
It's probably like in the top ten easiest things I've ever done.

17
00:01:25,129 --> 00:01:29,299
So you built a castle? Yes. You gotta be shitting me.

18
00:01:29,299 --> 00:01:34,700
So what the hell else have you done? I mean, you built a castle, what else?

19
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:38,700
Why don't you go check around the back there? Why? What's in there? It's a secret stash over there.

20
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:43,129
What are you talking about? Go check! Oh, okay. Yep. What do you got in here? Nothing.

21
00:01:43,129 --> 00:01:47,129
Oh my god. Just a bunch of fucking diamonds. This is ridiculous.

22
00:01:47,129 --> 00:01:51,129
It's not ridiculous. Hold on, back up. I am really, really confused right now.

23
00:01:51,129 --> 00:01:55,129
You've played for like three days. How do you have this many diamonds? It's not possible.

24
00:01:55,129 --> 00:01:59,129
No, it's not. It's easy. Like diamond everything, diamond armor, diamond swords.

25
00:01:59,129 --> 00:02:03,129
Listen, listen. You just have to be good. Wait a second.

26
00:02:03,129 --> 00:02:07,989
Why? What are you doing? Why what? You're playing in creative mode!

27
00:02:07,989 --> 00:02:11,990
No, I'm not! I knew I loaded up the wrong game! I'm not playing in fucking creative mode!

28
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:15,990
You shut up! No, but I mean, creative mode doesn't have, you don't have to gather resources.

29
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:19,990
I was wondering. I was like, what the hell's going on? How did he build smooth stone so fast?

30
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:23,990
I'm trying to make you look better. Because you said you were going to build a castle, and you never did it.

31
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:28,990
So I think it took the liberty to build a castle for you. And you're going to do this to me now?

32
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:32,990
You're going to throw it right back in my face? No, I just didn't know that that was the...

33
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:35,990
Well, I was trying to make people think that you were good at Minecraft.

34
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:39,990
And I just figured maybe you would appreciate it and maybe you'd like it, but...

35
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:44,990
No, I do. I'm sorry. No, I'm sorry. Come here. Come here. Give me a hug. Come on.

36
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:48,990
Give me a big one right here. Yeah, that's a good one.

37
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:56,990
So let's go get some ice cream. My treat. I have $1.25, which you'd buy us one like Kitty Cone and we could share it.

38
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:59,990
I'll just buy it. Okay, that works too. Okay.

39
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:03,990
So thank you guys so much for watching. I really do appreciate it.

40
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:09,990
Just wanted to throw this together, a special episode 10, because I did promise you guys a castle.

41
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:14,990
So here's the castle. It's a piece of crap, but at least I tried, right?

42
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:17,169
Or at least Grandpa tried.

43
00:03:17,169 --> 00:03:21,169
So where this series is going to go in the future now after episode 10, I'm not really sure.

44
00:03:21,169 --> 00:03:27,169
I think I want to try and do a duel. Let's play with somebody, get on a multiplayer server and do something fun.

45
00:03:27,169 --> 00:03:30,169
Maybe do some mods. We will see where it goes from here.

46
00:03:30,169 --> 00:03:33,169
So yeah, thanks again for watching. I will see you all next time.

47
00:03:33,169 --> 00:03:36,169
And take care everybody, right Grandpa?

48
00:03:36,169 --> 00:03:38,169
Take care everybody.
