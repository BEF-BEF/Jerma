1
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:13,929
Hey, what's up everybody? Hey, what's up everybody?

2
00:00:15,369 --> 00:00:44,100
What's up guys? Hey, what's going on? Hey, what's going on guys?

3
00:00:49,479 --> 00:01:02,070
Oh, oh my god. Oh my god. Hi guys. How you doing? I'm not late. I'm here. I'm fine.

4
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:09,530
He's practicing. Yeah, he's practicing. I had to get the intro right. I had to get it right,

5
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:24,890
but the mic was hot. Anyways, hello. How you doing? But he lied about Megamind.

6
00:01:25,689 --> 00:01:33,030
No, I did not lie about Megamind. It was a great movie. Uh, okay. Yeah, I'm going to give you a

7
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:44,620
synopsis. Fine. It's a blue, uh, evil guy who's an orphan sent to earth. Part of this other guy,

8
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:49,340
Metro Man. What do you mean? What do you mean? Tell us. Tell us. That's what I'm telling you.

9
00:01:51,930 --> 00:02:02,219
That there was, he makes hell. Space Dad, isn't it? I, it was, it was okay. I like the big ending

10
00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:14,460
parade that they did. Dude, the spoilers. What I did like the most about the movie was when he

11
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:20,250
turned himself into the police. He turned himself in and imprisoned himself. Just like Rick from

12
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:27,780
Rick and Morty did in that episode in season two. They put on a nice disguise. That's a holographic

13
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:38,310
disguise. And then Hal actually at the end, you know, the fucking evil computer. It was a fine

14
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:53,400
movie. I give it like a B plus. Okay. There was no evil computer. What are you talking about?

15
00:02:54,729 --> 00:03:02,280
Hal from, it's an evil computer. He lied. There is no evil computer. What? Yes, there is.

16
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:17,780
That's Space Odyssey. It was a fun movie. It was a fun movie. I like the, at the end when everybody's

17
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:24,139
dancing and the guy's in there and he's got like the orange suit on and he's dancing. Look,

18
00:03:24,139 --> 00:03:40,069
it doesn't matter if you think I watched it or not. I've seen it. I did see it. Anyways,

19
00:03:40,069 --> 00:03:43,349
it doesn't matter. Hey, welcome. We're going to play Fable II again. Hope everyone's having a good

20
00:03:44,150 --> 00:04:41,850
day. I'm ready to play. I'm ready to go. I have to tweet this though. I'll be right back. To the,

21
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:45,370
to the guy that said, I have really boring tweets. You're really not going to like this one.

22
00:04:46,899 --> 00:04:55,720
It's so boring. That was really boring. I just said more Fable II and that's it. I didn't say

23
00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:01,740
anything else. Use the GIF. I don't even have the GIF on my computer or my phone or anything.

24
00:05:02,379 --> 00:05:07,699
Why are you giving 50 community subs? You don't even know if the stream is going to be any good

25
00:05:07,699 --> 00:05:15,660
or not. That's so much money to give. That's too much money to give. What if the stream sucks?

26
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:23,079
That's so much money. Thank you. Zap X. Thanks to 50 community subs.

27
00:05:29,939 --> 00:05:32,579
Nah, thanks though. I appreciate that. That's too much money.

28
00:05:33,459 --> 00:05:39,879
Way too much money to give one single human. Remember, you act humble so you can get more

29
00:05:39,879 --> 00:05:56,490
money. It's a conspiracy. It's all just an act. You know, it's like really, all right,

30
00:05:56,490 --> 00:06:02,889
this is real. I'm going to do a real talk with you guys here. Yeah, like it doesn't matter how

31
00:06:03,449 --> 00:06:06,889
much like somebody says like, oh, you know, like, thanks. I don't like, don't need it. Don't want

32
00:06:06,889 --> 00:06:10,569
it though. Like, like you never know who's just fucking with you. You know what I mean? You just

33
00:06:10,569 --> 00:06:15,670
never know who's like, just lying to you. I get it. I get it. I could sit here and be like,

34
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:19,110
oh man, don't, no, don't do that. Don't do that, man. But like, oh, thank you. Thank you. Give me

35
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:22,870
more. Like there are people that are like that. It's like, how could you ever trust anybody?

36
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:30,490
I get it. No, I completely get you. Don't worry. Well, thanks though. Appreciate it. Thank you.

37
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:39,529
Oh, so true. Oh, so true. Yeah. He's farming like the so trues now. That's the next conspiracy.

38
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:50,009
Be honest for this. Even if I am honest, it doesn't matter. Okay. Let's go play a fable too.

39
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:59,399
It's fun. I have a confession to give you guys though. I may, I may have blacksmithed

40
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:05,480
like 20 minutes before the stream started. I wanted to get it out of the way because I didn't

41
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:09,959
want to just blacksmith for like the first 20 minutes of the stream. I just sat there in silence

42
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:18,009
getting like an extra 10 grand. Okay. We're of course going to do that again, but I at least

43
00:07:18,009 --> 00:07:25,449
removed one 20 minute portion of the stream where is it going to be blacksmithing. And I also noticed

44
00:07:26,089 --> 00:07:32,730
the weapons dealer here, the blacksmith here has a 50% off sale right now. It's a bargain at that

45
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:37,370
price. So I don't know why I just thought he was going to say it's a me Mario. I don't know why

46
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:45,000
every time it's a me. I don't know why that's what I thought he was going to say that items on sale.

47
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:54,360
Okay. So everything's 50% off. So I'm going to buy everything. Look at this 20. This is a $4,000

48
00:07:54,360 --> 00:08:06,329
sword. I'm going to get it for half off. Look at steel flintlock rifle, 2,400 bucks. I'll take it.

49
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:14,250
What are you going to do with the sword? With half a sword? What are you talking about?

50
00:08:15,589 --> 00:08:24,600
Oh, I get it. That's funny. Okay. And then what else do I need? Yeah. I got a gun. Okay. Now what

51
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:35,610
about who, anybody, you sell clothes here? Iron Axe is best. What do you mean best? 37

52
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:45,830
iron. Oh yeah. Sell this. Wait, wait. He's 50% off. I'm selling. Why am I selling this for 50% off?

53
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:52,100
That's not how this, I don't come to this guy and say, oh, by the way, I see the sign. You have a

54
00:08:52,100 --> 00:09:02,149
50% off sale. Me too. What? That's not how that works. God damn it. Whatever. I'll just go sell

55
00:09:02,149 --> 00:09:18,710
it next door to like the other guy. Yes. Ask questions about my daughter. What, who's this guy?

56
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:32,440
Kiernan the Traveler? Wait, is this my son? Kiernan the Time Traveler? Oh shit. All right. Now I

57
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:42,570
demand it. All right. Fine. I'll start. See? There we go. All right. So now I've got, I want to go to,

58
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:50,779
I want to get some new clothes. Alvin, that's my dog. Okay. I want to go. I want to get some new

59
00:09:50,779 --> 00:09:59,340
clothes. Where's the tailor? Who sells clothes here? Do more blacksmithing. No, I'm not going

60
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:12,019
to do more blacksmithing. Oh my God. What is going on here? 50 more community subs. What are you guys

61
00:10:12,019 --> 00:10:31,419
doing? From Video Vivi. Thanks for the 50 community subs. Again, another person. Thank you a lot.

62
00:10:31,419 --> 00:10:41,980
Thank you a lot. All right. I got a bunch of pies. I have to stay fat. Important. I know for a fact

63
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:52,200
that there's a demon door in this game somewhere. Then we have to find it. Okay. Hi. Here we go.

64
00:10:52,200 --> 00:11:01,049
Let's go do, I want the tailor. There's like a potion person. Why doesn't he not say community

65
00:11:01,049 --> 00:11:11,700
subs anymore? I got tired. That got tired. What does that mean? I heard there's a sale, but there's

66
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:17,799
not a real bargain or anything. What do you mean there's no bargain? That's a fine item.

67
00:11:17,799 --> 00:11:22,730
I'm just going to buy all these, these cheat codes. There you go. Come back anytime.

68
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:29,700
Alvarine strength potion. Oh shit. These are expensive, but I want them. There you go. That's

69
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:38,519
a fine item. Look at this. Uh, I'm going to get a healing potion too. Java potion, healing points.

70
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:44,700
Yep. That's a fine item. It's no longer a community anymore. There you go. There you go.

71
00:11:45,419 --> 00:11:53,350
That's a fine item. There you go. All right. Here we go. Face cam pretty please. Nope. No face cam.

72
00:11:53,350 --> 00:12:02,120
I don't do face cam. I'm a non face cam streamer. All right. I'm going to do a bunch of this.

73
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:10,179
I wish there was a quick menu. Like I remember the reviews of this game all saying that going

74
00:12:10,179 --> 00:12:17,129
like seven sub menus in or like three sub menus in to click on an item was horrible.

75
00:12:17,129 --> 00:12:28,139
It's a riot. Why are you writing? I'm not going to try. I don't want face cam on. No,

76
00:12:28,139 --> 00:12:46,330
you're not getting it. No face cam because you're naked. How I am clothed in the

77
00:12:46,970 --> 00:13:02,500
comfortable privacy of my own house is how I'm going to be. And that's final. I can be as nude

78
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:09,990
or non nude in my home as I want to be. This town is becoming more exclusive by the day.

79
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:17,559
It really is naked. I'm not naked, but that doesn't mean that I could be.

80
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:26,970
So don't be shocked. It couldn't be whatever the right way to say that.

81
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:35,799
All right. Concentrated XP. Now let's make some moves here. Okay. I got a lot of skills. Hello.

82
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:46,710
Oh, that's my wife. You don't romance me like you used to. Shit. Um, need any assistance?

83
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:54,779
Oh man. She's not happy at all. Don't worry. I'll just do a bunch of emotes.

84
00:13:55,419 --> 00:14:15,139
That's just wonderful. My good one. Yes. Oh, I can't game it. Come on. Do it.

85
00:14:22,519 --> 00:14:29,370
Why am I naked? I'm not naked, but I could choose to be if I choose. So right now I could,

86
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:47,899
understand. All right. We're good.

87
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:56,629
The fecal funny. Stop saying that. It's a, it's an incredibly important

88
00:14:56,629 --> 00:15:09,480
emote in the game. Don't you get it? Okay. I'm leaving. Now let me level up.

89
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:17,429
Just be happy that I actually off stream did all this bullshit.

90
00:15:18,389 --> 00:15:28,679
Okay. So I can do have about like nine, 10,000 blades. Three is 16,000. I think I'm going to

91
00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:38,500
wait for blades three, but I could probably do health, right? What the fuck level,

92
00:15:40,659 --> 00:15:47,850
level five shock. Everything else level one. Hmm. How about skilled? Okay. I could do speed

93
00:15:48,809 --> 00:15:54,679
or accuracy. Yeah. I want to accurate because the guy, I have a cool gun.

94
00:15:55,320 --> 00:16:10,299
What about dexter styles aimed ranged attack? Oh shit. I want to do that. I definitely want

95
00:16:10,299 --> 00:16:18,460
to do that. Brutal styles. This is flat. We'll get this flourishes. You've learned the brutal

96
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:23,419
style flourish while holding X, move your L toward an enemy to build up an unblockable flourish and

97
00:16:23,419 --> 00:16:29,340
then release X to unleash the flourish. Yeah. Cool. All right. Let's go. I got what I wanted.

98
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:44,840
Did you watch mega mind? Yes. And I agree with fucking, um, uh, what are the, um,

99
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:55,720
robert and I, okay. I agree with Ebert and robert who said that it was two thumbs way up.

100
00:16:55,720 --> 00:17:11,769
Who were the people that review the movies? Cisco and Ebert. No, but like, but it was Cisco

101
00:17:11,769 --> 00:17:25,269
and Ebert. Then it was Ebert and robert. Yeah, it was the Ebert and robert. I didn't, I didn't make

102
00:17:25,269 --> 00:17:36,009
somebody else. What are you talking about? That's a real, what are you talking about? All right.

103
00:17:36,009 --> 00:17:51,180
Let's go. I'm not, I'm ready to go. Quest. What should I do? Notholes Island, big freeze,

104
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:57,539
Donkey Kong country level, the temple of shadow gain entry to the temple. Wait, temple of shadow.

105
00:17:57,539 --> 00:18:02,579
That sounds evil. The summoners, two idiots have read from the Necronomicon, the book of the

106
00:18:02,579 --> 00:18:07,750
extremely dead, the gates of the nether world have opened the archeologist make donations at the

107
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:35,539
temple of light or go to the sculptor. Let me go to the sculptor. Prove you aren't high and naked.

108
00:18:35,539 --> 00:18:39,140
When could I ever prove that I'm not high and naked? What are you talking about?

109
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:44,809
You want me to have like a face cam on my body and have like a drug test in the same room? What

110
00:18:44,809 --> 00:18:51,180
are you talking about? Why do I hear the somebody after me? Why is this person after me? What's

111
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:58,299
going on? Hey, no, no, not in front of the shit statue. Come on. This is humiliating.

112
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:09,799
1600 gold. What you have been charged with murder times three. It's just, okay. Imagine getting

113
00:19:09,799 --> 00:19:17,450
like a ticket and they write murder X three on it. Uh, and I'm community service or all right,

114
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:22,119
I'll pay it here. I take the money and leave me alone.

115
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:41,500
Going to like Walt Disney world and like the sculpture of Disney in front of the right and

116
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:45,180
like in the garden is him holding his butt screaming while he's shitting his pants.

117
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:55,240
Oh, like the magic of Walt Disney world. He's screaming while like he's shitting into his

118
00:19:55,240 --> 00:20:22,579
hands. Okay. Well, there it is. 12 minutes of blacksmithing to atone for the wave to do another

119
00:20:22,579 --> 00:20:28,259
one. How many of these do I have to do? Should it just all be me shitting my pants? You wish to

120
00:20:28,259 --> 00:20:36,069
model for me again. I mean, why would I put these everywhere? What's wrong with me? Mission of statue

121
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:43,930
50 gold. That's it. You can become a monument for the whole world to admire. All right. Well,

122
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:54,420
let's do it. Literally ancient Rome. Oh, you know what to do. Okay. Begin posing. I can't fart this

123
00:20:54,420 --> 00:21:00,740
one. Anything you like, but remember to hold it until I tell you to. Can I do it with my ex?

124
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:09,619
No, no, no. Come on. Come on. Come on. No, the stupid sub menu. Yes. Your technique is

125
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:15,619
please. You must hold your pose until I say so. Not a moment earlier.

126
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:25,589
Yeah. All right. Come on. Yes. Your technique is astounding.

127
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:36,440
I hope you can sustain this performance. Okay. No, no, no. You stopped too soon.

128
00:21:38,809 --> 00:21:49,799
How long do I have to do that for? Yes. Your technique is astounding. Hope you can sustain

129
00:21:49,799 --> 00:21:59,509
this performance. Keep it up. Okay. I have never seen such modeling just a bit longer.

130
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:11,259
Okay. That's another like holding my ass, shitting in my hand statue. Never mind. It

131
00:22:11,259 --> 00:22:15,339
shall have to do. Is it going to be everywhere? Wait for my work any longer. I want the aliens

132
00:22:15,339 --> 00:22:25,859
to find us eventually. I mean, like in 500 years, I don't want, by the way, I don't want any recorded

133
00:22:25,859 --> 00:22:34,420
history. The only thing I want is I want like 15 statues of me holding my ass screaming. That's

134
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:38,180
the only thing that I want. Like 100 generations in front of us to look back and be like, why did

135
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:49,430
they, what was this for? Change pants? No. All right. So that was easy. Let's do, um,

136
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:59,980
summoners. Oh, jobs. Uh, let's do, let's do the summoners. These two idiots that, uh,

137
00:23:01,299 --> 00:23:09,240
or the hero. Now let's do a hero of will. Let's do the hero of will.

138
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:12,039
Didn't I say I was going to do this stuff? I was going to keep like progressing the story.

139
00:23:21,539 --> 00:23:41,450
You erected the same statue in the same town. What? There you are. I believe the second of our

140
00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:46,650
heroes, the mage is in Brightwood. There is a powerful will user there called Garth.

141
00:23:47,910 --> 00:23:54,859
Do you remember that name? He was there the night Lucien killed Rose. You didn't tell me that. How

142
00:23:54,859 --> 00:24:02,500
are we supposed to trust him? Garth believed Lucien's interest in the old kingdom was purely

143
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:08,500
academic like his own. And Lucien already on Garth thought Garth was merely a brilliant scholar.

144
00:24:09,619 --> 00:24:13,299
When each learned the truth about the other, their partnership ended

145
00:24:14,099 --> 00:24:23,180
violently. You will find Garth in Brightwood. I have seen a vision of him toiling on some ancient

146
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:28,779
technology there. All right, let's go. Surely he intends to stop Lucien, but he cannot do so without

147
00:24:29,019 --> 00:24:34,890
help. You can do a Necronomicon stream. No, that's terrifying.

148
00:24:38,869 --> 00:24:46,299
I already have enough like problems. Opening and reading from the Necronomicon is like, well,

149
00:24:46,299 --> 00:25:04,150
um, now I'm going to haunt your fucking house. The hero of will go to Brightwood. Oh, I haven't

150
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:13,900
found this location yet. Okay. Well, let's go. My father thought his faith would protect him from

151
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:25,819
the world. I won't make the same mistake. Let's go. This fable2.com bullshit.

152
00:25:25,819 --> 00:25:40,140
Websites didn't even exist back then. Are we having fun, Jeremy dear? Yes. This was 2008, 2009.

153
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:47,700
Websites didn't even exist. Websites were created in like 2013 or something.

154
00:25:48,500 --> 00:26:05,019
Your YouTube channel was in 2011. I was ahead of the curve. You know how NASA had the internet

155
00:26:05,019 --> 00:26:26,460
before everyone else did? It was me. Ooh, I like that. Ooh, I like this gun. What was the first

156
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:37,430
website? It was www.hamsterdance.com. Don't. Oh, they're just shooting at each other.

157
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:46,779
Are these guys bad? Who's a bad, are these bad guys?

158
00:26:50,460 --> 00:27:00,019
Do I help? I'm helping. Don't accidentally. Why am I, why is the guard mad at me for this?

159
00:27:00,019 --> 00:27:14,549
Oh, that was cool. Why are they mad about this? This is pissing them off. I'm helping you guys.

160
00:27:14,549 --> 00:27:28,619
What's, I don't understand. Stop right there. They don't like magic. What'd you find? You find

161
00:27:28,619 --> 00:27:41,910
something? 100 million off the dead. If you sing hamster dance. I don't remember what it was. It's

162
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:49,819
no, yeah, I do. So like, what was that?

163
00:27:56,779 --> 00:28:01,900
Something like that, right? And then it goes, here we go.

164
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:26,069
That's the remix, but you know, where's the dig spot? Ooh, clothing trader. Perfect. What do you

165
00:28:26,069 --> 00:28:46,710
got? Flogs. I kind of want it. Did I ever get a sun vest? Shirt? Striped bandana? No. Play the song.

166
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:56,140
No. Well, okay. There it is. All right. Come on. Let's go. Where is it? There you go. Good boy. Good

167
00:28:56,140 --> 00:29:18,470
boy. Good boy. Oh, the secret castle of Fairville. That's disgusting. Buried condoms? Why wouldn't I,

168
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:25,660
I would, who would pick a condom up off the ground? That is the most universal

169
00:29:26,779 --> 00:29:40,059
wretched thing that anyone could see on the ground. I mean, absolutely wretched universal.

170
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:46,839
If you see that, it's like, I want to leave this whole area. I don't want to be where I am right

171
00:29:46,839 --> 00:30:00,119
now. Just dump like, dump fucking alcohol all over where this is. I don't want to even be near here.

172
00:30:00,119 --> 00:30:08,309
Your dog is now a two-star treasure hunter. Oh, nice. Oops. Sorry I dropped that.

173
00:30:11,769 --> 00:30:27,400
That was only 150 bucks. Where's the big money? You can upgrade the dog. Oh, yeah. Dog is very

174
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:56,410
upgradable. Has he done the Armin impression yet? Not yet. Someone or something is coming my way.

175
00:30:57,210 --> 00:31:03,079
I have never felt anything like it. I would say that's a fucking victory royale coming my way.

176
00:31:03,799 --> 00:31:37,299
Oh, I can't make a reference to my, my like epic games name. Why not? Oh shit. Balvarine.

177
00:31:37,940 --> 00:32:08,230
Shit, what the hell just happened? And, oh, there's a huge bonus coming up here.

178
00:32:08,869 --> 00:32:20,220
What kind of bonus was that? 150%. I probably should, no, let's go towards the actual mission,

179
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:34,299
please. The way. There we go. You think you're good at this game? I don't think you can be good

180
00:32:34,299 --> 00:32:38,950
at this game. The fighting and the combat in this game is sort of just there for you to get to the

181
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:45,900
next part where you fart in front of a crowd of people. It's fun to play. It's not, it's fun.

182
00:32:45,980 --> 00:33:14,039
How's this? You found an empty statue. Oh shit. Perfect. What's going on? How's it doing this?

183
00:33:14,039 --> 00:33:18,200
Oh my God. I didn't even see them. What? What happened? I couldn't even tell they were there.

184
00:33:19,619 --> 00:33:41,190
That was really weird. Don't let him go. He tripped over his own feet. I need 10,000. I need 14,000

185
00:33:41,190 --> 00:34:07,539
to get to blades three. His friend just got down. Oh, I see what you mean. All right, dig. Where is

186
00:34:07,539 --> 00:34:29,159
it? You got it? You can do it. Come on. He's finding it. Yeah, there we go. More condoms.

187
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:44,869
How come the sus guy is not doing the voice today? What voice? Doesn't the sus guy not have a voice?

188
00:34:45,429 --> 00:35:06,280
It's just, it's just the face, right? It's the boss. Oh, Balvarines. I just want to see a

189
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:10,889
Balvarine so I can just stop saying Balvarine. Oh shit. This is the real deal.

190
00:35:19,079 --> 00:35:35,820
Save Garth. On it. Ow. Watch it. See, imagine if the game was like Dark Souls and it was played

191
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:41,340
like this. It was fable Dark Souls. Microsoft, just make another one. Everybody's copying

192
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:46,150
fucking From Software. Like nobody, it doesn't matter anymore. From Software just took the

193
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:50,150
model and made it like really cool and interesting. Just copy it. Like everybody's doing it. Every

194
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:54,070
single game company now is like making their own like Dark Souls system. Just put it in. Just do

195
00:35:54,070 --> 00:36:07,980
it. Just make fable four and make it a Dark Souls game. They're literally making a new fable. Yeah,

196
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:21,539
but it has to be a Dark Souls copy. Otherwise, I won't be happy with it. Maybe Elden Ring will

197
00:36:21,539 --> 00:36:37,699
be like that. Maybe. It's the racing game people that are making the new one. What do you mean

198
00:36:37,699 --> 00:37:09,480
the racing game? Big finish. It's the Forza devs. I mean, look, they might do a really good job. I

199
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:13,960
can't. I'm not going to be one of those people that goes, well, they're a racing game dev. They'll

200
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:19,269
never do a fun video game ever. That's not a car game. I'm not going to say that because I don't

201
00:37:19,269 --> 00:37:32,570
know. For all we know that the lead designer of Forza has been waiting to make like a fable

202
00:37:32,570 --> 00:37:40,170
game his entire life. You want me to like pass judgment on something that doesn't exist yet?

203
00:37:40,170 --> 00:38:05,739
Somebody leaked the Elden Ring investor trailer. Wait, what? Investor trailer? That doesn't make

204
00:38:05,739 --> 00:38:16,039
any sense. From Software is not a publicly traded company. What do you mean investing trailer?

205
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:47,530
Private investor? Literally true. Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow. Holy shit. Eat. What am I doing?

206
00:38:48,329 --> 00:39:00,360
Oh, wow. I didn't want to do that. Where's my, um, how did this change?

207
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:43,909
Oh, that was cool. That was really cool. This game's fun. Oh, and flourish. That was fun.

208
00:39:44,469 --> 00:39:53,579
Okay. How are we doing? Is this worth playing? Yeah, I think, I think so.

209
00:39:54,219 --> 00:40:13,460
I would say fable is a, is an experience worth playing. How was that? I'm coming Garth.

210
00:40:25,179 --> 00:40:29,980
You left too soon Garth. Lord Lucian's experiment was a radical success.

211
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:50,409
You are coming with me. They got him. There was nothing you could do.

212
00:40:51,130 --> 00:40:55,619
That was Lucian's commandant and apparently he now controls a shard,

213
00:40:56,420 --> 00:41:02,579
an old kingdom weapon of great power. Lucian's strength grows ever more formidable as does his

214
00:41:02,579 --> 00:41:07,860
mastery of the spire and its awful machinery. Come back to the guild. Okay. But first let me

215
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:21,400
check and see if there's any, uh, valuable shot. You can, you guys tell me like fecal funny. What

216
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:54,570
do you mean trespassing? Let's head back to the guild. Fecal funny. Look it up. All right. Where

217
00:41:54,570 --> 00:41:58,170
is he? Sounds like you could have used my help after all. I knew I should have come.

218
00:41:59,449 --> 00:42:02,889
We cannot allow Lucian to keep Garth. You must get him out of there.

219
00:42:04,090 --> 00:42:12,969
They're being the spire. Wait, inspire the sound of your own heartbeat. There is one who might know

220
00:42:12,969 --> 00:42:19,369
when Lucian left for the spire, he essentially abandoned his staff. His old butler Jeeves now

221
00:42:19,369 --> 00:42:25,980
spends his days at the current corset. His butler? I bet he saw his fair share of dirty dealings.

222
00:42:27,239 --> 00:42:31,159
Well, if it means a trip to the pub, we'll just have to make that sacrifice. Or not like Minecraft

223
00:42:31,159 --> 00:42:34,920
and think it's going to be around for a long time. The task requires tact and delicacy.

224
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:52,860
Something I believe you're after. No, you literally asked this last week. I'm still,

225
00:42:52,860 --> 00:43:04,179
I'm just checking. Anyone playing Battleship yet? I have to check in on that every like month or so

226
00:43:04,179 --> 00:43:16,010
too. No? Not yet? Okay. I'm telling you, just look, just wait for the YouTube thumbnails

227
00:43:16,570 --> 00:43:21,449
of like the Battleship in the middle and two like popular YouTubers or streamers

228
00:43:21,449 --> 00:43:24,969
both like freaking out in the thumbnail. Like, oh my God, I can't believe that move.

229
00:43:26,019 --> 00:43:58,739
It's going to be Battleship. I'm telling you Battleship. Battleship has no strategy. So?

230
00:43:58,739 --> 00:44:18,809
And yes, it does. How does it not have strategy? Oh, this person has a gift. What do I need to do?

231
00:44:18,809 --> 00:44:32,809
Oh, almost there. Hold on. Of course it has strategy. Minesweeper has more strategy than

232
00:44:32,809 --> 00:44:41,260
Battleship. Let me ask you this. Let me ask you this question. Does Mario Party have more

233
00:44:41,260 --> 00:44:55,059
strategy than Battleship? Yes. 25% discount of the whole. Really? Nice.

234
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:09,340
You only have three items. Should I try to do like Jack Sparrow?

235
00:45:21,239 --> 00:45:37,849
There's so many ways to reduce RNG in Mario Party. Archmage robes. That's what those are.

236
00:45:37,849 --> 00:46:22,949
Okay, I like this. This looks very odd. Oh, Pauline. It's like I'm a pirate that got

237
00:46:22,949 --> 00:46:29,900
clothing that was five sizes too small. I was last in line to get my pirate uniform.

238
00:46:30,539 --> 00:46:43,530
I'm sorry, Dave. All we have are extra smalls. Kill it.

239
00:46:50,219 --> 00:46:58,630
I feel like this character kind of talks like a baby. He's like the big dumb guy.

240
00:46:58,630 --> 00:47:04,389
Yeah, I guess I want to go that way, boss. That's what Peter Griffin's based off of,

241
00:47:04,389 --> 00:47:10,730
that character. That like Looney Tunes character is who Peter Griffin's voice is based off of.

242
00:47:10,730 --> 00:47:14,969
Listen to it. I think that guy actually says that. I think he's like,

243
00:47:15,769 --> 00:47:19,210
oh, boy, I don't know what I'm doing. I think that's Peter Griffin.

244
00:47:19,210 --> 00:47:36,329
It's a Boston accent, genius. I have no idea. I'm not like from that area. I have no idea.

245
00:47:36,329 --> 00:47:42,469
Never been there before. I spent 30 fucking years in Boston. I don't even know what that is.

246
00:47:42,469 --> 00:48:02,760
What town, what city is that? I know it's Rhode Island. Yeah, but it's New England.

247
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:06,760
It's the Boston accent. It's a New England accent. Just look, I know it's Rhode Island.

248
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:13,690
It's Pawtucket, Rhode Island. That's a Boston accent that Peter Griffin has.

249
00:48:18,409 --> 00:48:30,070
What happened to your Boston accent? What am I doing in here?

250
00:48:36,710 --> 00:48:40,730
What is everyone doing in here? I'm trying to do a quest.

251
00:48:43,429 --> 00:48:44,869
The whole town is coming in here.

252
00:48:50,579 --> 00:48:54,260
And here's something else that's written down. My price.

253
00:48:56,260 --> 00:49:05,000
I apparently offended that person. I don't even know what I did. 1,000 gold pieces and not a penny less.

254
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:13,670
It's my final offer. Take it or leave it. Lucian's diary is a riveting read, I assure you.

255
00:49:13,670 --> 00:49:19,030
I'm sure some private collector will make a nice place for it in his equally private home.

256
00:49:19,030 --> 00:49:21,110
Oh, we're shooting this guy in the head? Or what?

257
00:49:21,110 --> 00:49:25,030
Unless you've got a proposition, I suggest you leave me to my whiskey.

258
00:49:49,849 --> 00:49:55,699
Honey, please, you don't want to be in here. Get out of here. I'm like, I'm doing something.

259
00:49:56,420 --> 00:50:00,699
You don't, I don't want you to know what I do for work. You think I put this fucking mask on and

260
00:50:00,699 --> 00:50:07,449
what do you think I do? Go work at the fucking like grocery store? Get out of here. I'm trying

261
00:50:07,449 --> 00:50:27,579
to do something. Where were we? I want to like fucking punch him. Do I have to pay him?

262
00:50:27,579 --> 00:51:02,179
That extra animation. Dog, get him. I think I have to pay him. I don't think I, I think I have to pay him.

263
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:30,949
I have to, I have to pay him. Fine, here's a thousand dollars.

264
00:51:31,190 --> 00:51:38,579
Or not. It's a juicy little collection. I assure you, you won't regret it.

265
00:51:42,150 --> 00:51:47,909
I buried Lucille's diary. I'm just tuning her out. I want to hear what she's saying.

266
00:51:54,489 --> 00:52:00,260
I want, I want to hear what she's saying. I don't like, I want to be able to hear it.

267
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:03,639
Okay, let's go.

268
00:52:25,349 --> 00:52:37,030
I have to get out of here. I was thinking, I can't shoot her. I can't, I'm sorry.

269
00:52:38,630 --> 00:52:43,849
I told you to get out of here. You don't want to see what I'm doing. Can I take that money back?

270
00:52:44,860 --> 00:52:49,739
You're horrible. I didn't do anything, okay? I shot that guy because he was dick and I didn't

271
00:52:49,739 --> 00:52:57,139
want to pay him. I didn't ruin everything. I'm fine. I need to put the gun away. You got the money?

272
00:52:57,780 --> 00:53:05,590
I want to put the gun down. Put the gun down. Put the gun, I, what's the put gun away move?

273
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:14,260
Put the gun down. Hide till they can't see me. Oh my god, get out of here.

274
00:53:14,260 --> 00:53:39,400
What are you doing? Oh shit, right. Did they see me? No, I didn't. Oh my god.

275
00:53:51,900 --> 00:54:05,030
I played football when I was 12. I know all the jukes. Oh.

276
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:32,809
I can't believe my wife left me because I shot a guy.

277
00:54:32,809 --> 00:54:36,969
Why was she even there? What was the, I need to rent my, wait, there's a baby.

278
00:54:36,969 --> 00:54:53,130
Where's the baby? What happened? Is the baby still here? Hey, she took the kids.

279
00:54:53,130 --> 00:55:08,090
Oh, well, I didn't want her to see that. All right, anyways, what's the next mission?

280
00:55:08,090 --> 00:55:15,900
I have horns growing out of my head. No, I don't. Oh shit, I have, okay. I have like sprouts. Uh oh.

281
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:27,500
Okay, we gotta do some, go donate to the church. I'm gonna go donate to the church right now.

282
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:38,679
I've got a bunch of money. I'm gonna go to donate to the church. Donating to the light. Okay.

283
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:05,639
It was you, the guy hiding with the gun in his hands. If I just didn't, I,

284
00:56:05,639 --> 00:56:35,300
what's the holster button? A. It is A. God damn it. Okay, I'm here to donate money to the church.

285
00:56:35,619 --> 00:56:41,980
Please contribute to our temple and receive the blessing of the light.

286
00:56:41,980 --> 00:56:46,440
I will. Each donation will bring you wisdom and peace of mind.

287
00:56:47,849 --> 00:56:53,719
Anybody got a sander? Can I just lean down? I just need to borrow a sander for a little bit.

288
00:56:53,719 --> 00:57:06,170
I gotta sand something off my head. Okay, how much do I need to give to be a good person?

289
00:57:06,170 --> 00:57:14,230
Do I, you? What? What? Donate when the light is brightest to receive greater wisdom.

290
00:57:14,789 --> 00:57:22,780
Do they know I'm a murderer? How? How do I donate? To turn safety on?

291
00:57:29,019 --> 00:57:32,789
How do I donate? Wait, the loot?

292
00:57:38,409 --> 00:57:54,360
Is this a donation? Okay, I can't donate to the church. Why? Stand in the light and donate.

293
00:57:54,440 --> 00:58:02,860
What's going on? Looking for your next victim, murderer?

294
00:58:02,860 --> 00:58:09,099
Yeah, you, if you say that again. Why would you walk up to a murderer and say,

295
00:58:09,099 --> 00:58:12,780
oh, what, you're looking to murder some more people, murderer? You're gonna murder me?

296
00:58:13,929 --> 00:58:16,409
Don't do that to a fucking murderer. A guy that's like,

297
00:58:16,409 --> 00:58:19,940
we'll just kill people for no reason. What are you doing?

298
00:58:19,940 --> 00:58:24,420
Oh, look, it's the murderer. Oh, yes, sir. But that's the guy with the gun.

299
00:58:24,420 --> 00:58:31,719
Perhaps your generosity will make- I think this is bugged.

300
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:51,000
Go to the bowl? Oh, how much should I give? How much money does it take for me to bring my

301
00:58:51,000 --> 00:59:03,639
five grand? Ten thousand? I'm not gonna give all of it. I want to have some money.

302
00:59:03,639 --> 00:59:29,960
You want to be good, give 10k. Now I have to go backwards. I went a little too far.

303
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:33,699
This is just like when I'm at the fucking gas station and I want to do an exact even number

304
00:59:33,699 --> 00:59:42,699
and it ends up like that. And it's like, fuck! Give six, six, six.

305
00:59:48,099 --> 00:59:52,980
Oh, your heart is fit to burst in with generosity, I see. 75 good points.

306
00:59:52,980 --> 00:59:56,900
I believe you have earned the honor of becoming the next harvest benefactor.

307
00:59:58,280 --> 01:00:03,239
Make a large enough donation during the holy hour and you will receive the harvest reward.

308
01:00:03,239 --> 01:00:04,199
When's the holy hour?

309
01:00:05,079 --> 01:00:06,760
And you will know it is right.

310
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:13,880
Make a large donation when the mystical sun reaches its zenith. What does that mean?

311
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:26,340
Between 12 and 1? How do I know what time it is?

312
01:00:28,150 --> 01:00:30,070
Oh, okay, so between 12 and 1.

313
01:00:30,789 --> 01:00:32,230
All right, I need, I need more money.

314
01:00:32,230 --> 01:00:35,269
All right, let's go make money. I'm gonna be a blacksmith for a little bit. Sorry.

315
01:00:35,829 --> 01:00:43,800
I know this is supposed to be me actually doing quests, but it's too bad. I killed a guy.

316
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:57,369
Bartender? Oh shit, I want to do this. I need to donate 10k.

317
01:00:57,369 --> 01:01:13,420
Okay. All right, I want to go do the bartending.

318
01:01:19,590 --> 01:01:22,679
All right, bartender. How does this work?

319
01:01:26,090 --> 01:01:28,889
Serve. It just has to be green?

320
01:01:29,849 --> 01:01:38,389
All right, this is easy. Old multiplier.

321
01:01:48,579 --> 01:01:52,360
Don't you feel like if anyone ever did that,

322
01:01:52,360 --> 01:01:55,079
this shit would just fucking fall over halfway and get everywhere?

323
01:01:55,639 --> 01:01:58,630
That stuff doesn't, you can't really do this, can you?

324
01:02:00,780 --> 01:02:04,539
I feel like that would fall over halfway and hit like the four or five people at the bar

325
01:02:04,539 --> 01:02:08,809
and go all over. Can you actually do this?

326
01:02:18,730 --> 01:02:23,210
My stomach just hangs over it. I'm balancing it on my stomach.

327
01:02:23,210 --> 01:02:31,019
How much more do I have to do? 9 bucks?

328
01:02:31,980 --> 01:02:34,940
This sucks. Why would I do this? I would just go be a blacksmith.

329
01:02:34,940 --> 01:02:45,340
I can make $10,000 in five minutes. Bar has to be waxed. Oh, that makes sense.

330
01:02:45,340 --> 01:02:55,639
That's a wonderfully poured pint with a game of keystone. Perfect.

331
01:02:55,639 --> 01:03:00,179
Because you're level one. Okay, but I mean, 12 bucks?

332
01:03:00,179 --> 01:03:04,500
Level five would be what? Like 50? 100? Should I level this up?

333
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:12,059
That's a perfect head on that one. Bartender makes money faster.

334
01:03:12,059 --> 01:03:17,500
Delicious looking pint. Okay.

335
01:03:18,139 --> 01:03:32,570
Level two bartender. You're comparing an entry level barkeep to a master blacksmith.

336
01:03:32,570 --> 01:03:36,710
I know, but is it going to be worth it in the end?

337
01:03:43,619 --> 01:03:47,610
Gambling will pay the most. Do they have like a version of Blackjack or something?

338
01:03:55,050 --> 01:03:57,380
They do. Where is it?

339
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:04,920
Keystone? I don't like roulette. Roulette? I don't know.

340
01:04:15,820 --> 01:04:17,420
Oh, me? Yeah.

341
01:04:17,420 --> 01:04:20,699
Yeah. But here's the best part.

342
01:04:20,699 --> 01:04:25,380
Nobody knows who I am because I have a mask on. Never taking it off.

343
01:04:28,070 --> 01:04:31,590
Oh yeah, I did kill your friend. I never know who I am.

344
01:04:31,590 --> 01:04:49,849
Well, you're the fattest guy in town. I think the blacksmith is a very large man.

345
01:04:51,800 --> 01:05:04,500
Yeah, I don't think so. Holy shit. No, that was perfect.

346
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:11,190
What? It's perfect. That was perfect. Do you see how perfect that was?

347
01:05:11,190 --> 01:05:14,699
It was all the way at the end. Perfect. What the hell?

348
01:05:14,699 --> 01:05:30,309
A wasted beer. Oh, man. Is there anything more tragic than a wasted beer?

349
01:05:31,030 --> 01:05:35,429
Oh, man. Dropping it. Oh, fuck, dude. Wasted beer. Waterfowl.

350
01:05:35,989 --> 01:05:46,460
Nothing worse than a wasted beer. Your cousin from Boston.

351
01:06:03,829 --> 01:06:11,420
Play pub games? Hey, look, I paid, okay? They came to me. They said,

352
01:06:12,219 --> 01:06:25,190
you can either go to jail or pay a fine. I paid the fine. And lady, don't want to be like a little...

353
01:06:25,190 --> 01:06:30,150
I don't want to have to tell you this, but I've got $10,000 in my pocket right now.

354
01:06:30,150 --> 01:06:41,320
It was $1,600 for murder. That means I can kill eight people in this room right now. Watch it.

355
01:06:42,599 --> 01:06:51,340
Everyone that wants to come up to me and be like, oh, you fucking bastard,

356
01:06:51,340 --> 01:06:55,780
I would take you back and I'd shoot you. Oh, would you? Okay. Do you have $1,600?

357
01:06:56,579 --> 01:07:03,639
Because if you do, then just pull the trigger because that's what it costs to murder in Albion.

358
01:07:16,940 --> 01:07:26,699
That's the cost of killing somebody. You forgot about the $10,000 you spent

359
01:07:26,699 --> 01:07:36,630
on the church for forgiveness. Well, I didn't have to do that.

360
01:07:36,630 --> 01:07:43,190
Wait, the cost is $500. It was $1,600 because you killed three people. Wait, was it? Oh, shit. Okay.

361
01:07:43,750 --> 01:07:53,590
So let me rephrase that. It's $500. Now, okay, you do the math. It's 27 coin for one of these beers.

362
01:07:56,469 --> 01:08:05,480
So in the amount of time it takes for you to drink 15 of these beers, you could have already

363
01:08:05,480 --> 01:08:18,869
killed me and gotten away with it. Let that sink in everybody here. 18 beers per murder.

364
01:08:35,260 --> 01:08:38,439
This job sucks. Go gamble. Actually, this is pretty good actually.

365
01:08:40,279 --> 01:08:44,920
I can see how this would be in. This would be like a hundred bucks. Yeah, I'm getting this low five.

366
01:08:45,640 --> 01:09:01,260
Nice point. Your character looks like my drunk uncle cosplaying as Raphael from the Ninja Turtles.

367
01:09:10,390 --> 01:09:19,399
6,500 gold till promotion. How long is this going to take? 108? Oh, this is going to take forever.

368
01:09:22,220 --> 01:09:28,420
This is going to take forever. The gold multiplier is only five.

369
01:09:30,579 --> 01:09:34,859
Wonderfully poured pint. That's it? Okay, no.

370
01:09:40,149 --> 01:09:48,810
I'm watching someone else press A every two seconds repeatedly. What am I doing with my life?

371
01:09:50,409 --> 01:10:00,699
Um, we're just hanging out. Man, we're just hanging out here. The right amount of foam is no foam.

372
01:10:01,260 --> 01:10:09,779
Can we talk about foam for a sec? Look at the head on that. I've won it. You know, like in

373
01:10:09,779 --> 01:10:14,680
cartoons and TV shows and movies and literally this video game you're looking at right now,

374
01:10:14,680 --> 01:10:19,159
the big tankard with the root beer or the beer that has like the big like whipped cream kind

375
01:10:19,159 --> 01:10:29,770
of foam all over it. I wish that existed. Like I want a huge like goofy whipped cream big foam

376
01:10:29,770 --> 01:10:43,210
on top of my drinks like that and nobody ever you can never get it. It does Guinness. Yeah,

377
01:10:43,210 --> 01:11:01,670
but Guinness is gross. Guinness is liquid bread. It's disgusting. I'm sorry. I know everyone who

378
01:11:01,670 --> 01:11:06,939
loves Guinness. Yes. Oh, Guinness. You gotta get Guinness. Guinness. Oh yeah. When I take a sip

379
01:11:06,939 --> 01:11:22,329
of Guinness, I feel like I feel like I have to chew Guinness. It's too much. Guinness to me,

380
01:11:22,329 --> 01:11:27,210
it kind of has like the same look and feel and taste as the thing you tar your driveway with.

381
01:11:37,529 --> 01:11:43,539
I don't drink beer. I'm not a beer drinker. Okay. Everyone's like, I'm seeing it right now. Oh,

382
01:11:43,539 --> 01:11:48,100
he's like, he likes the American stuff. Oh, Bud Light. No, Bud Light is gross too.

383
01:11:53,539 --> 01:12:00,710
To me, Bud Light is the opposite side of the spectrum where you have like those food coloring

384
01:12:01,270 --> 01:12:06,300
little droplets that you fill up like a bunch of soda water and you have like a beer-flavored

385
01:12:06,300 --> 01:12:21,510
food coloring dropper and you like and stir it in. I just, I don't like beer. I really just don't.

386
01:12:26,069 --> 01:12:29,909
Somebody said Blue Moon. Blue Moon is actually okay. I actually don't hate Blue Moon,

387
01:12:29,909 --> 01:12:46,539
but Blue Moon is the hangover beer, isn't it? Bud Light's the only beer I've ever finished.

388
01:12:46,539 --> 01:12:51,619
I've never finished though. Yeah, because when you get to the end of a Bud Light,

389
01:12:51,619 --> 01:12:56,779
it's kind of like, it's kind of gross. It kind of, it feels like, all right, I'm going to be

390
01:12:56,779 --> 01:12:59,739
kind of, people are going to be grossed out by this, but I have to say it. I'm going to say it.

391
01:12:59,739 --> 01:13:03,180
So just, I'm going to say something gross. Every time I've ever gotten to the bottom of a beer,

392
01:13:03,819 --> 01:13:08,649
like the last three or four sips of a beer, I'm talking maybe like an inch at the bottom of the

393
01:13:08,649 --> 01:13:14,470
glass or the bottle. To me, it's as if somebody swished it around in their mouth and spit it back

394
01:13:14,470 --> 01:13:33,220
into the glass. I can, I can never finish a beer. I just can't do it. You know what beer that I

395
01:13:33,220 --> 01:13:40,220
actually kind of really liked? It was this beer, and I know I'm, look, everyone's going to laugh

396
01:13:40,220 --> 01:13:46,619
because it's like the name of the beer. It was this microbrewery. What the hell was it called?

397
01:13:46,619 --> 01:13:53,510
Circus Boy. It was a Magic Hat, right? That was cool. It was like this unfiltered Heffenweizen.

398
01:13:54,229 --> 01:14:02,039
I remember I tried it one time and I was like, this is actually kind of cool. This is kind of

399
01:14:02,039 --> 01:14:11,960
good. It was called Circus Boy. Yes, Heffenweizen. Am I saying that right? Heffenweizen? Heffenweiser.

400
01:14:11,960 --> 01:14:25,050
Okay. What does that mean? I like Heffenweisens. Someone explain to me what I like. You drink IPAs?

401
01:14:25,050 --> 01:14:36,300
No. Heffenweisen is God tier. But what is it though? So when I order a beer, what do I know

402
01:14:36,300 --> 01:14:41,460
that I like? I don't like the liquid bread. I don't like the food coloring flavoring. It's a Belgian

403
01:14:41,460 --> 01:14:53,750
beer. So I need to order Belgian beers to wheat beer. Okay. Yeast and wheat. Okay. Your cousin

404
01:14:53,750 --> 01:15:09,609
from Boston. Well, that's what I like. That's the beer that I like. This actually is making a shit

405
01:15:09,609 --> 01:15:22,359
load of money. Blue Moon is a wheat beer. Oh, okay. That's why I like it. The really common German

406
01:15:22,359 --> 01:15:32,100
Bavarian beer. All right. Well, that's what I like. Right, Corona? I actually don't, I'm not a big

407
01:15:32,100 --> 01:15:47,979
Corona. I don't like Corona. It's okay. What? No. Fuck that. I did it. Dip shit American. It's not

408
01:15:47,979 --> 01:16:06,680
pronounced that way. Okay. Sorry. You're now at two beers per murder. I'm a wine drinker. You all

409
01:16:06,680 --> 01:16:19,609
know that. I like wine. I like whiskey. I like vodka. But there's an asterisk on vodka because

410
01:16:19,609 --> 01:16:26,170
there's a lot of disgusting, just gross cheap vodka that is smells and tastes like nail polish.

411
01:16:26,170 --> 01:16:37,020
It's nail polish remover. I get a good vodka is good. But there's a certain level where it's

412
01:16:37,020 --> 01:16:43,829
undrinkable, in my opinion, even when you mix it. I remember I had a screwdriver one time with like

413
01:16:43,829 --> 01:16:48,869
gross cheap vodka. And it ruined orange juice for about 10 years for me. I couldn't drink orange

414
01:16:48,869 --> 01:16:57,270
juice anymore. It just it was such a disgusting fucking rancid beverage. It was it was disgusting.

415
01:16:57,270 --> 01:17:09,909
I could not drink orange juice for like 10 straight years. Do I like flavored vodka? No,

416
01:17:09,909 --> 01:17:15,720
not really. I just like a nice like decent quality vodka doesn't have to be like super high quality

417
01:17:15,720 --> 01:17:28,939
but good enough. So it's not going to ruin the drink of vodka is the same Jeremy.

418
01:17:31,819 --> 01:17:39,989
It's not whiskey is the grossest thing in the world. Well, look, that's it. I have had

419
01:17:39,989 --> 01:17:43,829
whiskies before that somebody's like, Oh, man, you should try this on and it's got it's got this

420
01:17:43,989 --> 01:17:48,390
it's got a really smoky flavor. You're gonna love it. It's very smoky and it's got hints of

421
01:17:48,390 --> 01:17:53,449
almond and I take I take a little sip and it tastes as if somebody asked a cigar in my mouth.

422
01:17:55,220 --> 01:18:00,739
No exaggeration. Someone asked a cigarette into my mouth. It's fucking disgusting.

423
01:18:04,100 --> 01:18:10,090
But there's other whiskies that are fine that they taste good. They're smooth. They have like a nice

424
01:18:10,090 --> 01:18:22,359
flavor profile to them. That's me with bourbon. That's why it's good. Palate of a 16 year old.

425
01:18:23,510 --> 01:18:29,270
Ashing a cigar in my mouth is not how is that a 16? I didn't say I like ordering mac and cheese

426
01:18:29,270 --> 01:18:35,270
and chicken fingers off the kids menu. I don't like really smoky like cigar fucking whiskies.

427
01:18:43,930 --> 01:18:51,590
I actually don't like rum. I'm actually not a big spiced rum fan either. Spiced rum to me tastes

428
01:18:51,590 --> 01:18:57,739
like they're hiding something. I feel like it's been flavored and spiced to a point where you

429
01:18:57,739 --> 01:19:03,930
don't like you don't taste what it really tastes like, which is bad. I feel like it's like hiding

430
01:19:03,930 --> 01:19:12,810
something gross. I don't know why. That's what I feel like. I have $25,000. What happened? What?

431
01:19:12,810 --> 01:19:29,350
Oh my god. What about gin? Okay. Gin is awful. Gin might be the worst of all of them. Gin just

432
01:19:29,350 --> 01:19:42,409
tastes like pine salt. Gin tastes like car air freshener. No. I don't think anybody, no. Gin is

433
01:19:42,409 --> 01:19:48,390
one of those things that I think is very specific. And by the way gin and tonic reminds me of the

434
01:19:48,390 --> 01:19:55,609
thing that like they would give fucking patients back in like the 1400s at the doctor's office.

435
01:19:55,609 --> 01:20:03,109
It's awful. It's just awful. It just tastes awful. It's awful. Oh you know what kind of drink I want?

436
01:20:03,109 --> 01:20:06,550
The shit that they used to give people before they sawed their legs off in like the fucking

437
01:20:06,550 --> 01:20:11,930
1200s. No. Why would, why do we have so many options? Why would you choose that one?

438
01:20:14,010 --> 01:20:26,500
You have so many choices. Why choose that? Drinking is immoral. You kind of.

439
01:20:26,899 --> 01:20:42,729
How do I feel about tequila? I think a good tequila is okay. I think tequila has that same

440
01:20:42,729 --> 01:20:48,920
kind of gross spectrum that vodka has. A really really like kind of shitty tequila is the same

441
01:20:48,920 --> 01:20:56,970
thing as drinking the really shitty vodka. It's awful. I think tequila is good mixed with certain

442
01:20:56,970 --> 01:21:02,489
things. I don't, I would never drink tequila. Like I mean why would you ever drink tequila straight?

443
01:21:03,369 --> 01:21:08,260
Why would you drink vodka straight either? But like a vodka soda is essentially drinking vodka

444
01:21:09,060 --> 01:21:14,500
without anything in it. A vodka soda with like a lime in it or something or a vodka like with

445
01:21:14,500 --> 01:21:29,180
cranberry. That's pretty close. Fuck. I wasn't paying attention. I'll get it. Moscow mule. Moscow

446
01:21:29,180 --> 01:21:35,220
mules are amazing. I love Moscow. A really good Moscow mule is awesome. I mean I haven't drank

447
01:21:35,220 --> 01:21:44,069
alcohol in a very long time but you know just talking here. If I would think of my favorite

448
01:21:44,069 --> 01:21:48,949
drink like what I would order and be happy with pretty much anywhere it would probably be a Moscow

449
01:21:48,949 --> 01:21:54,229
mule or a vodka pineapple. Those are the only two drinks that I would like comfortably order

450
01:21:54,229 --> 01:22:07,130
anywhere and be like okay I will probably like this. Anything else I would be like meh. Lots of

451
01:22:07,130 --> 01:22:12,250
places have their own little drink menus where it's like oh here's our uh the special the special

452
01:22:12,250 --> 01:22:19,850
like oh I can't even like I can't think of two like dumb like words that don't mean here's our uh

453
01:22:20,819 --> 01:22:27,060
the sunrise into the sunset. I don't whatever they have the fucking dumb list and have the names

454
01:22:27,060 --> 01:22:34,539
or the the Albert Einstein sunrise right. I don't but I don't order those. I think they're a little

455
01:22:34,539 --> 01:22:44,199
too complicated. It's like oh like famous person and like a time of day. I don't I don't order the

456
01:22:44,199 --> 01:23:04,659
famous person and time of day or weather drinks. They're like oh it's uh no Nikolai Teslas.

457
01:23:06,090 --> 01:23:17,750
Raindrops like I don't know. I'm sorry. Kathy Mitchell's Express 101. I mean I would absolutely

458
01:23:17,750 --> 01:23:23,369
what what I would order that. That sounds amazing. Uh why does this keep happening?

459
01:23:30,470 --> 01:23:42,010
Are they gonna need batteries? Would you order a cloudy sandler? No. That's breaking the rule of

460
01:23:42,010 --> 01:24:01,399
of like famous person and weather or time of day. I don't order those. What about absinthe?

461
01:24:01,779 --> 01:24:13,159
I've never had absinthe before. I kind of don't want it. Kind of scary because I know it's like

462
01:24:13,159 --> 01:24:18,279
oh yeah well absinthe back in the day they used to put uh like uh this like weird thing in it

463
01:24:18,279 --> 01:24:23,140
that made you like hallucinate. I don't want I don't want that. They don't do that anymore right

464
01:24:23,140 --> 01:24:31,819
but like I don't want it. That's not even true. I know but it's like a weird dumb like urban legend

465
01:24:31,819 --> 01:24:41,819
around it. Yes I know I've read the chain email and I like believe the chain email but I don't

466
01:24:41,819 --> 01:24:46,300
know. I just and it's like oh what you have to do is you have to take a sugar cube place it like

467
01:24:46,300 --> 01:24:49,979
five feet above your head spin around pour it over no I just want to drink the fucking drink

468
01:24:49,979 --> 01:25:00,899
I don't I don't know I don't want to do that or adjective and animal yeah that's another one

469
01:25:01,460 --> 01:25:16,779
or adjective animal famous person time of day and weather the the the the Theodore Roosevelt

470
01:25:17,899 --> 01:25:26,140
nighttime jack-o-lantern surprise bear you know I don't just add an adjective I'm trying to pay

471
01:25:26,140 --> 01:25:39,850
attention to the game somebody just said we get it I know I'm just like I'm trying to pass the time

472
01:25:44,470 --> 01:25:59,659
that's every word combo no it's not that's not every word combo what would my drink be though

473
01:26:00,649 --> 01:26:05,289
what would the germa 985 be let's figure that out okay what would the germa 985 be

474
01:26:06,710 --> 01:26:16,520
it would start start with some some good quality Tito's vodka you take the Tito's vodka fill it up

475
01:26:16,520 --> 01:26:26,119
to about one two fingers then a splash of grenadine and then a little bit of soda water and then

476
01:26:27,510 --> 01:26:37,239
squeeze a lemon squeeze a lime top it off with a little bit of pineapple juice and then put it in

477
01:26:37,239 --> 01:26:43,779
the microwave for 10 seconds take it out of the microwave put ice in it stir stir stir stir stir

478
01:26:44,100 --> 01:27:02,010
take the ice out and then put a parsley on it don't put it in the microwave I just imagine like

479
01:27:03,210 --> 01:27:13,779
like in like a ceramic mug then light it on fire no and then throw it away

480
01:27:19,180 --> 01:27:27,909
throw it away have the trash get taken out drive behind the trash truck it would have

481
01:27:27,909 --> 01:27:31,510
absorbed a bunch of other shit at that point scoop it out of the truck when it gets to the dump

482
01:27:31,510 --> 01:27:36,359
two ice cubes stir it up spin it up put it inside of one of those shakers

483
01:27:36,359 --> 01:27:55,319
bring it to a priest they bless it gargle it gargle it gargle it oh fuck

484
01:28:00,649 --> 01:28:07,579
put it down the toilet a delicious flush the toilet put the cup down with the water swirling

485
01:28:07,579 --> 01:28:18,220
on the edge of the toilet to capture it onto the table another thing parsley and by the way it's

486
01:28:18,220 --> 01:28:44,729
like $400 we get it top it off with a sneeze no 11 000 people are watching this shit

487
01:28:46,920 --> 01:28:53,720
okay look I don't I don't choose the people that are watching this stream I'm just here

488
01:28:56,470 --> 01:29:00,550
I can't like I'm sorry I'm sorry that there's been people are here

489
01:29:03,369 --> 01:29:10,979

492
01:29:35,029 --> 01:29:50,949

498
01:30:55,289 --> 01:31:02,260
grenadine soda water squeeze a lemon squeeze a lime stir it up maybe a little bit pineapple juice

502
01:31:37,859 --> 01:31:44,039
Tito's is probably better than Grey Goose like in regards to like value and I think Tito's is a good

503

589
01:53:57,109 --> 01:54:06,140
this is the actual game like the story missions are probably the worst part of the whole experience

590
01:54:06,140 --> 01:54:31,609
it's probably like a five out of ten okay here we go I'm going to do this is it better than

591
01:54:31,609 --> 01:54:46,539
better than pouring beers for an hour that's the fable experience yeah I'm sorry though I

592
01:54:46,539 --> 01:55:00,140

606
01:57:52,149 --> 01:58:24,310
one of them was somebody extorting you and they probably they had a gun in their back pocket

607
01:58:24,310 --> 01:58:36,739
it was murder plus one heart okay here we go stay here this is I don't want you to get

609
01:58:51,260 --> 01:59:01,239
to die medieval times doesn't mean murder is okay bandits are bad but murdering people was

610
01:59:01,239 --> 01:59:08,970
still a very bad person behavior like people would just people would would fucking swing their

611
01:59:08,970 --> 01:59:16,090
axes as people yeah murder was bad it always has been bad but I mean I'm walking around with a

612
01:59:16,090 --> 01:59:31,539
fucking like a sword and a gun on my back and they're like bandits everywhere everybody does

613
01:59:31,539 --> 01:59:36,979
it so I look so this guy's shooting at me with a rifle these people just look at this this is

614
01:59:36,979 --> 01:59:50,970
what the medieval times were like look at this this is what it was like why did I lose so many

615
01:59:50,970 --> 02:00:00,890
points what what what's going on they have bandits what's do you want me to not to do this

616
02:00:01,449 --> 02:00:11,619
you should hit my dog that's not a civilian that was not okay that was not a civilian that was a

617
02:00:11,619 --> 02:00:18,810
bandit I know I have magical fucking daggers that come out of my hands I'm talking about

618
02:00:18,810 --> 02:00:35,140
like the nature of medieval times people with the guns no you know what I'm trying to say

619
02:00:35,140 --> 02:01:05,899
all right I gotta help this guy that's a nice weapon but be careful I'm good there were no

620
02:01:05,899 --> 02:01:16,699
streamers in the middle ages yeah there were no iPhones either no TVs there were no treadmills

621
02:01:17,579 --> 02:01:21,829
oh hold on oh he didn't like that

622
02:01:24,579 --> 02:01:26,100
steel mace no I don't want this

623
02:01:36,899 --> 02:01:40,659
good observation yeah there were no there were no treadmills in the medieval ages right

624
02:01:40,659 --> 02:01:46,090
see that's why I'm so that's why I'm so big uh the dog by the way has changed

625
02:01:51,109 --> 02:02:04,869
horse troll dog is a retriever defeat the troll yeah the dog has changed into a golden retriever

626
02:02:16,020 --> 02:02:36,779
too I'm too good watch out dog he's dead got it we do a little trolling here

627
02:02:41,579 --> 02:02:56,439
oh nice there's a dig spot what's the what okay if you're evil if you're actually all the way to

628
02:02:56,439 --> 02:03:14,550
the other end of the bar what does the dog look like Lucian's diary but it will do you a little

629
02:03:14,550 --> 02:03:24,649
good without a translation bring it back to the guild coming this looks like it was meant to be

630
02:03:24,649 --> 02:03:35,770
an MMO I I mean it was a pretty ambitious game for back 12 13 years ago longer than that right

631
02:03:35,770 --> 02:03:47,189
with 14 what 12 13 how you can determine how ambitious a game was is did it come out before

632
02:03:47,189 --> 02:04:01,909
or after GTA 4 GTA 4 ruined everything GTA 4 I believe was what 2007 2008 like if your game

633
02:04:01,909 --> 02:04:10,250
was not as good as GTA 4 holy shit that changed that changed everything GTA 4 is like ambitious

634
02:04:10,250 --> 02:04:16,170
game was like if you thought you had an ambitious game and your game came out before GTA 4 maybe

635
02:04:16,170 --> 02:04:39,260
not after though you can read that but visor you know I see other worlds than this GTA 4 sucked

636
02:04:39,899 --> 02:04:45,579
and in other worlds you can see I don't understand that's a that's a troll you make it that's just

637
02:04:47,420 --> 02:04:55,430
Lucian is recruiting guards from Westcliff oh come on Westcliff's a dump full of pullers and thugs

638
02:04:55,430 --> 02:04:59,909
the only thing there is that arena yeah GTA 4 was one of the best games ever made

639
02:04:59,909 --> 02:05:05,270
it are physically tough and mentally weak Lucian is recruiting the winners as guards

640
02:05:06,569 --> 02:05:12,949
you must enter the crucible in Westcliff and emerge from it victorious it is the only way into

641
02:05:12,949 --> 02:05:20,569
the spire the only way to get to garth and rescue him I think a lot of you guys forget the kind of

642
02:05:20,569 --> 02:05:28,550
interesting systems that were introduced in GTA 4 people being able to get like into fights and

643
02:05:28,550 --> 02:05:32,550
stuff without you having to do anything about it people literally talking shit to each other

644
02:05:32,550 --> 02:05:37,350
getting in car accidents and like a police showing up you didn't do anything that was very very

645
02:05:37,350 --> 02:05:53,909
different than anything we've been used to like the AI engine that they came up with for GTA 4

646
02:05:53,909 --> 02:06:19,319
was better than anything else before it just the way that people move remember that uh there was

647
02:06:19,319 --> 02:06:26,550
that technology that I think rockstar acquired but like bumping into stuff and the AI moving

648
02:06:26,550 --> 02:06:34,390
accordingly what was it called it was it was an actual technology about like AI reacting to things

649
02:06:34,390 --> 02:06:43,590
euphoria right yep the act of like bumping somebody with your car and they interact with

650
02:06:43,590 --> 02:06:49,460
the car with their arms and legs and body that was all AI that was huge that was ridiculous

651
02:06:49,460 --> 02:06:54,979
because it was always just animations it was like oh this is you got hit by the car there's an

652
02:06:54,979 --> 02:06:58,659
animation that plays after you got hit and it's like pretty much the same animation every time

653
02:06:58,659 --> 02:07:04,539
the euphoria engine was just like holy shit wait like we can have people react to things the way

654
02:07:04,539 --> 02:07:11,859
they actually would if they got bumped and it won't be just an animation that plays that was a

655
02:07:11,859 --> 02:07:25,050
huge deal no not ragdolls not ragdoll physics existed well before that the act of the AI reacting

656
02:07:25,050 --> 02:07:31,609
to stuff randomly if you bumped into them if they were hit by something it wasn't a ragdoll it was

657
02:07:31,609 --> 02:07:45,850
the AI engine would react to getting touched in a certain way if you have if you have a few minutes

658
02:07:45,850 --> 02:07:49,289
to go look up the euphoria engine and you'll see what i'm talking about it was revolutionary

659
02:07:49,289 --> 02:07:54,090
no not ragdoll ragdoll is just the ragdoll is the whole rig just falls apart

660
02:07:54,090 --> 02:08:20,310
don't look it up what procedural animation gta 4 invented physics you gotta get out of here

670
02:10:55,319 --> 02:11:04,899

02:16:23,989 --> 02:16:30,789
then who executes the executioner wait i kind of i may have missed what you said executing who

686
02:16:30,789 --> 02:16:51,020
executes the executioner um okay are you fond of riddles why am i about to hear one three great

687
02:16:51,020 --> 02:16:58,649
men sit in a hall a priest a rich man and a warrior each one bears the cell sword to kill

688
02:16:58,649 --> 02:17:10,280
the other two who lives who dies he's of not favor of the crown nor of the of the church it depends

689
02:17:10,280 --> 02:17:16,709
on the cell sword uh if it's cell swords we care about then what's the real who's the real power

690
02:17:16,709 --> 02:17:24,659
his power his knowledge is power and a very small man can cast a very large shadow you know the

691
02:17:24,739 --> 02:17:39,719
fucking bit by how i've been here for ages right let's go i think one of the most famous game of

692
02:17:39,719 --> 02:17:55,159
thrones monologues i know we all hate that show but like the first few seasons were good lucy's

693
02:17:55,159 --> 02:18:05,020
writings are fascinating there's much in them that they interest you press on to west give

694
02:18:05,020 --> 02:18:09,260
yeah the first few seasons of game of thrones are some of the best television ever yeah it is

695
02:18:09,260 --> 02:18:16,760
speaking of which area was completely overrun even the fourth and fifth seasons were they're

696
02:18:16,760 --> 02:18:24,469
all right the four season was okay but once they got away from like the books it was just like

697
02:18:24,469 --> 02:18:36,459
well whatever i guess this shit's gonna happen yeah well you see you see us at hboc george wrote

698
02:18:36,459 --> 02:18:43,979
on the back of a piece of toilet paper uh like three major plot points and that was it and then

699
02:18:43,979 --> 02:19:10,139
we just kind of made up everything else oh uppercut i think my main problem with game of thrones is

700
02:19:10,139 --> 02:19:18,250
that it just i just don't ever want to watch it again like i was so excited to get new people

701
02:19:18,250 --> 02:19:25,610
involved in that show it's like wow you've never seen game of thrones you didn't all the books oh

702
02:19:25,610 --> 02:19:31,100
my god we're in the middle of like season three right now this is the greatest thing you will ever

703
02:19:31,100 --> 02:19:37,260
this is our generations this is our generation's lord of the rings like this is our tolkien it's

704
02:19:37,260 --> 02:19:43,180
right here and now it's just like i don't even want to i would never want to watch the whole

705
02:19:43,180 --> 02:19:56,420
show again because i know what happened like i know what happens halfway through this is the lord of

706
02:19:56,420 --> 02:20:06,790
the rings for like the millennial generation this is perfect it's what we can tell our kids about

707
02:20:06,870 --> 02:20:18,360
like lord of the rings i kind of thought it was gonna have the same like cultural impact

708
02:20:18,360 --> 02:20:33,770
and it did for a while until it didn't all the rings is overrated yeah well you could all right

709
02:20:33,770 --> 02:20:42,170
you but the cultural impact of like lord of the rings on media and like fantasy media i don't care

710
02:20:42,170 --> 02:20:55,940
how much you think is overrated it's like the same thing as dungeons and dragons for video games

711
02:20:57,110 --> 02:21:01,430
the only reason why i'm shooting this guy with a rifle or hitting with a sword is because i got a

712
02:21:01,430 --> 02:21:13,159
few guys started to create dungeons and dragons wait that was a horrible thing to do whatever

713
02:21:22,229 --> 02:21:48,649
like rpg's they only exist like all these things only exist because of dungeons and dragons bad

714
02:21:48,649 --> 02:21:57,139

867
03:01:12,729 --> 03:01:20,329
you're already a mad dog you're three stooges hero it's intimidating any seems confusing to me

03:01:21,049 --> 03:01:28,360
i mean i get irving the strangler gibbons it toughens it up a bit doesn't it but it's

869
03:01:28,360 --> 03:01:35,639

871
03:01:42,309 --> 03:01:48,149

03:02:06,680 --> 03:02:12,600
hero you must find a way to impress those men and you must do it alone there are still many

876
03:02:12,600 --> 03:02:18,200
people in the world whom you could help with your heart good or evil your reputation will be made

03:02:22,620 --> 03:02:28,139
what's that did you see that you see what i just did over there do you have any idea what

878
03:02:28,219 --> 03:02:32,860

879
03:02:33,420 --> 03:02:37,579

quest the cruise earned 500 more renowned to gain entrance to the crucible find and rescue

888
03:07:23,479 --> 03:07:32,819
slaves the temple of shadows aren't looking for a business partner to win his 5 000 gold in his

889
03:07:32,819 --> 03:07:40,860
new scheme that sounds i'll do that ripper and his bandits have been terrorizing a farming family

890
03:07:41,659 --> 03:07:46,760
the temple of light is under threat of attack from its worst enemies the shadow worshipers

891
03:07:49,100 --> 03:07:57,819
red harvest help rippers bandit crew expand its operations i'm gonna do defender of the light

892
03:07:58,459 --> 03:08:19,239
do the shooting range and get the best gun get back let me just get some renown there he is the

893
03:08:19,239 --> 03:08:40,649
light bringer uh yeah i don't have free aim yet okay let's go here defend the temple so i can get

894
03:08:40,649 --> 03:08:54,920
some more points to on the good side what do you need i was hoping you would return the temple is

895
03:08:54,920 --> 03:09:01,559
in need of a protector once more we have always suffered at the hands of the vile cultists from

896
03:09:01,559 --> 03:09:08,200
the temple of shadows but i fear they're preparing a major attack against us where are they it would

897
03:09:08,200 --> 03:09:13,399
seem the shadow worshipers are planning to poison the holy water in the wellspring cave

898
03:09:14,680 --> 03:09:19,479
if that happens the golden oak will die i can't have that it would mean the end of our order

899
03:09:19,479 --> 03:09:26,579
perhaps even the end of the village and all its people you helped us once before will you do so

900
03:09:26,579 --> 03:09:33,940
again i will as long as you give me i can put you down as a reference for me being a good person

901
03:09:34,500 --> 03:09:41,020
first thing you must do is to check the statues from which the water pours forth

902
03:09:41,020 --> 03:09:46,680
ensure they haven't been contaminated with the taint of evil the shadow worshipers are

903
03:09:46,680 --> 03:09:51,559
likely to target the main chamber next but you mustn't allow them to desecrate it

904
03:09:54,389 --> 03:10:09,829
okay let's go kill some shadow worshipers i really should level up the gun stuff

905
03:10:10,469 --> 03:10:13,590
i think the guns are more fun than magic but i'm okay it's kind of too late

906
03:10:15,739 --> 03:10:22,680
not really though all right hold on will shock three which would be pretty good blades

907
03:10:23,239 --> 03:10:36,219
four sixty four thousand eight hundred that's three four five that's close vortex four

908
03:10:41,350 --> 03:10:56,200
hmm time control might be kind of cool i use shock all the time i feel like that's so cool

909
03:11:01,020 --> 03:11:17,979
vortex four let's do it sell the skills back with why i'll just sell chaos back i'm not

910
03:11:17,979 --> 03:11:29,620
going to use it all right ray there's also rays dead which would be kind of cool

911
03:11:32,629 --> 03:11:39,829
all right accuracy 36 000 extra here we go ranged aim i can now do it now

912
03:11:40,979 --> 03:11:48,100
hold y to enter aim mode click left or right while you're locked on enemy to instantly

913
03:11:48,100 --> 03:12:03,829
switch to other targets okay speed might as well just get it let's see so you do i have to hold

914
03:12:03,829 --> 03:12:13,049
it the whole time oh i have to hold it the whole time if i want to stay in there that's kind of

915
03:12:13,049 --> 03:12:20,139
cool i can now headshot people oh dear do the shooting contest all right let me hold on let

916
03:12:20,139 --> 03:12:36,379
me let me do this part first got vortex four oh this takes some bomb all right if i'm going

917
03:12:36,379 --> 03:12:46,420
to do vortex four then that means i don't i'll do blades three vortex four and then shock one and

918
03:12:46,420 --> 03:12:58,379
shock two that sounds good to me does the game have bubsy 3d tank controls no i mean it's a it's

919
03:12:58,379 --> 03:13:23,540
a little floaty but i wouldn't say it's that ridiculous bubsy isn't floaty well i mean i

920
03:13:23,540 --> 03:13:33,079
didn't say bubsy was floaty i said this was floaty oh my god walk over it what's wrong with you

938
03:21:10,969 --> 03:21:24,540
that's it almost everyone in westcliff has heard about you for better or worse cool now you can go

939
03:21:24,540 --> 03:21:48,870
back to the crucible gatekeeper all right let's go back to uh mad dog and murray the shooting

940
03:21:48,870 --> 03:22:03,829
gallery yeah not funny do something funny tell the do something funny story or sing the doing

941
03:22:03,829 --> 03:22:10,170
something funny song i like that comment okay where's the shooting gallery

942
03:22:14,120 --> 03:22:34,950
oh fortune's tower sure i actually forget how this one's played pressing your luck played with

943
03:22:34,950 --> 03:22:39,190
a unique deck of cards a deck contains mostly number cards ranked from one through seven plus

944
03:22:39,190 --> 03:22:48,950
a here plus four hero cards this deck contains eight of each card ranked one through seven

945
03:22:49,430 --> 03:22:56,549
uh other decks may contain nine or even ten sets okay place a bet to start the game your bet must

946
03:22:56,549 --> 03:23:06,889
be 15 gold or some multiple of 15 here the dealer starts by dealing three cards the first card is

947
03:23:06,889 --> 03:23:12,090
facedown and is called the gate card the next two cards are faced up and create the second row there

948
03:23:12,090 --> 03:23:21,129
can be as many as eight rows if you play all the way to the bottom of the tower all right this is

949
03:23:21,129 --> 03:23:27,049
the starting deal on each row you have a choice you may take the dealer's offer or deal another

950
03:23:27,049 --> 03:23:31,700
row the dealer's offer is equal to the total value of cards in the row on this role the offer

951
03:23:31,700 --> 03:23:37,690
is nine remember you bet 15 you cash out now for nine gold to push on and hope for a higher value

952
03:23:37,690 --> 03:23:44,260
push on all right row three would be worth 18 but wait you've also caught a vertical pair

953
03:23:44,260 --> 03:23:51,420
pairs such as this will often end the game but not always all right same rank on the previous row

954
03:23:51,979 --> 03:24:01,590
here will cause misfortune ending the game with a value of zero okay okay here's a worth zero

955
03:24:01,590 --> 03:24:10,790
go but they keep it from safe from pairs okay all right ah this is stupid i don't just whatever i

956
03:24:10,790 --> 03:24:26,170
just go when an entire row matches you get more money all right let's go i i get it i don't care

957
03:24:26,809 --> 03:24:43,049
i want a jackpot it's just it's a it's a mobile game whatever it's cool and tutorial all right

958
03:24:43,049 --> 03:25:01,340
i'm going all in yeah why can i only deal 15 six and five no no deal six and six i lose

959
03:25:03,979 --> 03:25:14,440
six and two is eight deal all right put that over there 12 deal again blocked it out deal

960
03:25:15,000 --> 03:25:29,540
this game's terrible two times bonus deal 13 deal it again all right block it out do it again go

03:25:31,209 --> 03:25:43,799
hero card highlights rise up snap them out stop this is this game's awful

04:27:28,260 --> 04:27:35,049
fucking believe how bad that is i'm holding why the whole time why would it pull me out and it's

1145
04:27:35,049 --> 04:27:51,219
just like oh you're out the rain is making this fucking harder to aim dropping my frame rate to

1146
04:27:51,219 --> 04:28:03,379
like 18 i what are you doing what is it doing that for why is it doing that i don't understand

why is it doing that i'm just holding why it's over i want to turn my face came on and be like

1149
04:28:29,860 --> 04:28:39,959
it's as if i'm not touching why i don't know why it's doing that this would have been pretty

1150
04:28:39,959 --> 04:28:50,440
close to is the controller busted no it's called caring about fucking rain and dropping your fps

1151
04:28:50,440 --> 04:29:01,110
of the whole game by 20 that was gonna be so close to use a mouse this game's not on pc

1152
04:29:09,260 --> 04:29:14,100

1154
04:29:32,420 --> 04:30:03,690

1155
04:30:03,690 --> 04:30:08,489

1156
04:30:08,489 --> 04:30:15,450
of when to press it and when to hold it like why is shoot hold why is aim you remember when

1157
04:30:15,450 --> 04:30:20,409

move on fighting the guards this place feels i'm too slow

1399
05:43:53,750 --> 05:44:09,849
can't think of one thing to say not what is this place six years i was a mason's apprentice

1400
05:44:10,729 --> 05:44:18,759
what are we all doing here how is this possible old kingdom engineering i reckon but then how's

1401
05:44:18,759 --> 05:44:30,549
it come back now oh here it comes world outside these marvelous walls is a corrupt rotting husk

1402
05:44:31,939 --> 05:44:41,819
reason is absent instead of order find the guy in the crowd on drugs chaos does not punish evil

1403
05:44:41,819 --> 05:44:49,099
nor reward righteousness it'll be hard chaos cuts innocent lives short and we're to accept this as

1404
05:44:49,099 --> 05:44:59,540
fate i beg to differ you stand in the center of a great instrument of change with it i shall

1405
05:44:59,540 --> 05:45:08,340
remake the world and my creation shall be unrecognizable in its perfection sounds of

1406
05:45:08,340 --> 05:45:15,209
your own heart is not sufficient for such a monumental task it is only through your toil

1407
05:45:15,849 --> 05:45:21,290
through your labors through your conviction that albion will be transformed

1408
05:45:24,380 --> 05:45:32,470
hear the sound you feel beneath your feet these sensations will soon be as familiar as your own

1409
05:45:32,470 --> 05:45:40,279
heartbeat there it is and so long as your heart continues to beat all that i require of you

1410
05:45:40,279 --> 05:45:55,319
is obedience now sleep okay you can do that i think vortex nice fucking shit spell

1411
05:46:05,479 --> 05:46:12,360
morning maggot welcome to the spire hope you like it because you're never leaving of a shotgun

1412
05:46:12,360 --> 05:46:18,040
color on now you're in the barracks you'll eat and sleep here and the rest of the time you will work

1413
05:46:18,040 --> 05:46:25,290
wherever the commandant assigns you your job is keeping the scum building this place in line

1414
05:46:25,290 --> 05:46:31,529
and otherwise doing whatever the commandant tells you without like a friar talk even order

1415
05:46:31,529 --> 05:46:38,729
you will obey it immediately which brings me to that new piece of jewelry you've got

1416
05:46:38,729 --> 05:46:45,130
the color is part of lord lucy's saw collar well you're wearing one too the commandant will

1417
05:46:45,930 --> 05:46:54,069
explain it to you main thing is do what you're told and don't try taking the color off because

1418
05:46:54,069 --> 05:47:00,310
you can't and the penalty for even trying is dead and not the quick and painless kind

1419
05:47:00,310 --> 05:47:08,099
either now report to the commandant it's an extra extra extra large they had to custom order this

1420
05:47:08,099 --> 05:47:15,659
for me it's not worth the costs you know if that guy just acts up just shoot him with a rifle

1421
05:47:15,659 --> 05:47:38,819
get a break for it never mind sock on turn safety off let's fucking start smashing people

1422
05:47:38,819 --> 05:48:29,830

1428
05:49:08,860 --> 05:49:11,979
what makes us guards of them like workers that we keep prisoner
