00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:05,190
Hello, everybody. How are you? Speak, speak, speak. I'm here. I'm here.

2
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:17,649
So today, we have been a night, saw you last night, but seeing you again right

3
00:00:17,649 --> 00:00:27,660
now. We've got another co-op stream today. This one is going to be with some

4
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:35,579
familiar faces, Ster and italics. The three of us are going to play a game

5
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:41,740
called tools up. It's like a mix of overcooked and house flipper.

6
00:00:43,899 --> 00:00:47,380
Who knows? The game might be good. It might not be, but it seems like it

7
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:55,500
could be pretty fun. We are currently streaming this through steam remote

8
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:00,280
play. So this is going to be a journey. We took a little extra time to get it

9
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:07,239
ready. So we have tested it. It does work. We are, but we're, we're ready.

10
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:19,900
They're both currently doing their intros because they're streamers. And

11
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:28,939
I'm just sitting here in outer space. Show us the hammer. Hammer. When is

12
00:01:28,939 --> 00:01:45,260
halo? God damn it. You know, it's really, really awful. I feel like I need to

13
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:54,030
wait like a week to play halo again. I have such a, it's like eating ice cream

14
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:58,790
for the first time. You take a bite of ice cream while somebody stabs a knife

15
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:04,379
into your back. You are always going to have synonymous the memory of eating

16
00:02:04,379 --> 00:02:09,930
ice cream for the first time with when you got stabbed. So I want to play halo

17
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:21,009
very, very badly, but I got stabbed while we played. It's all I, I got the

18
00:02:21,009 --> 00:02:41,360
bad memory. Joel scarred him for life. Joel hates Jeremo. This is a different

19
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:52,159
co-op stream today. This is tools up. I wonder. Here's the funny thing. This is

20
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:55,439
what they know this and now you're going to know this. And it's actually kind of

21
00:02:55,439 --> 00:03:00,840
funny. The way the steam remote play works is I am in total control of both

22
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:08,780
of their streams. I am broadcasting this to their computers. So I'm in

23
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:14,860
control. They have, they can't press any buttons. They can't change any sliders

24
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:18,860
or anything. So I'm in the driver's seat. So if I just start playing the game

25
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:21,819
right now, if they have their desktop audio enabled, this is going to start

26
00:03:21,819 --> 00:03:33,780
playing. Let's find out. Let's see if anybody said, did it work? It should be

27
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:43,439
playing some music through there. No, hold on. I'm muted. Right now. Yeah, it is.

28
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:55,360
Alright, watch this. Yeah, come over here. Take a look at this. I'm in fucking control.

29
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:16,920
Alright, did I fuck up, did I fuck up the streams? He was muted. Yeah, no, they're

30
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:30,180
both muted right now. They're both doing their intros. Well, this is tools up. Or

31
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:36,300
are they both muted desktop audio and did I just do that to you guys? I wonder.

32
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:47,620
That's probably, yeah, that's probably what it was. But they're, hey, they're muted on stream, but they

33
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:51,699
heard it. There's no way they didn't. Impossible for them not to. It's impossible.

34
00:04:51,699 --> 00:04:58,189
They heard that. Alright, I'm ready. I'm just gonna be in the

35
00:04:58,189 --> 00:05:02,740
Discord call waiting for him. I'm just gonna be talking. Who are we waiting for?

36
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:14,420
Are you here? How's it going, everybody? What's going on? How's everybody doing? Yeah, what's up, man? Hey, dude. Hey, long time no see.

37
00:05:14,579 --> 00:05:19,779
How's everybody doing? You guys all at the menu? How was your Thanksgiving? Oh, man.

38
00:05:19,779 --> 00:05:28,379
What'd you guys, what'd you guys get for Black Friday? I got a table. You guys can't

39
00:05:28,379 --> 00:05:36,060
both talk at once. Someone learn how to like... Oh my god, that's so fucking loud.

40
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:47,189
Are you nuts? He's doing it on purpose. I'm in fucking control. I had Jerma streaming a

41
00:05:47,189 --> 00:05:56,040
game so that we can restream his game. No report. How do you report a player in

42
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,819
Steam? Well, you guys will be the ones getting reported because you're

43
00:05:58,819 --> 00:06:03,220
streaming my stream. Alright, I had to turn you down to like 40% because you

44
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:10,019
just... You personally, your voice blasted my audio and now you're like quiet as a

45
00:06:10,019 --> 00:06:15,540
whisper. Oh, dude. We've already played the game for 10 seconds. Fucking liars. Go back to our 10

46
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:21,379
seconds. I don't want to start over. Alright, let's do a new save slot. That one's

47
00:06:21,379 --> 00:06:27,300
corrupted. Did you guys explain how this works to everybody? I don't know how this

48
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:32,699
works. Alright, Jerma is streaming this game to the cloud. The magic of the cloud

49
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:38,139
is enabling me and Stirr to connect and use our controllers as if we were

50
00:06:38,139 --> 00:06:43,459
sitting next to him in the same house. Can you imagine being in the same house?

51
00:06:43,899 --> 00:06:50,980
Yeah. It's called the internet. They just rolled out the internet this week and they're letting us try it as a beta.

52
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:56,300
Yeah. But this game is what I meant. I don't know how... I have no idea how this game

53
00:06:56,300 --> 00:07:03,230
works. Alright, you guys... Here comes the cutscene. This game requires friends. You can be

54
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:14,569
anywhere on earth. That's us. How do you know? Hey, I'm driving. You haven't seen

55
00:07:14,569 --> 00:07:27,500
this yet. Oh, nice. You almost hit that. Okay. Oh, yeah. Why can't they see the

56
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:33,980
cutscene? Wait, they can't see the cutscene? Hold on. My thing's bugged. I'm in control of the cutscene.

57
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:40,860
Oh, they can't see it. Wow. What? What do you mean nobody can see it? It's also showing the main menu. This internet

58
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:46,139
beta is not going well. Wait, what? Hold on. You guys skipped the cutscene?

59
00:07:47,339 --> 00:07:55,240
Presumably. Hold on. But it's so cute. It's really not. Okay. I'm going to skip the cutscene.

60
00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:01,459
So you guys just have to... I can see it now. You guys have the over cooked? I untoggled the

61
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:10,779
the cap feed and then re-toggled it. And that seemed to work. Okay. How does it look? You guys

62
00:08:10,779 --> 00:08:19,319
good? We good? Who's player two? Who just did that? I am. That's me. I am. Okay. Okay. Hold on.

63
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:31,259
Because now I can't. Okay. Okay. I'm player three. Okay. Everyone remember that. No one

64
00:08:31,259 --> 00:08:39,500
for the rest of any of our streams ask who is who or I'm going to be mad. Okay. First one ready.

65
00:08:40,139 --> 00:08:49,299
Wait. What the heck? You just dropped out of the game. You hear me pressing? Okay. I'm ready.

66
00:08:49,299 --> 00:08:53,700
All right. Are we ready? Yeah. First one ready. Let's go. Player one's me. Player two,

67
00:08:53,700 --> 00:09:01,429
Talek's player three star. No, I'm player three now. What? Are you? Yeah. Oh, you are.

68
00:09:02,309 --> 00:09:10,070
So no one asked. I'm player two. I just don't. I'm just like the Super Mario guy.

69
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:15,980
All right. I'm gone. I don't even know. I don't know who you guys are. I don't know.

70
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:26,679
I'm lady who is player two. So you got the hard hat. Left stick is elevator. What? No, it's not.

71
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:34,899
We're to fix this house. Oh, I just walked under a ladder. That's how much I did too. Hey, hey,

72
00:09:34,899 --> 00:09:37,860
hey, hey, I'm the one in control. Don't tell me just did something and I'm supposed to be in

73
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:46,070
control. Sorry. I'll be here. No, I'm clear one. Okay. So we have to fix the house. Overall

74
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:52,309
progress. We're being timed. How are we being timed? What constitutes as a fixed house? Living

75
00:09:52,309 --> 00:09:57,029
mom. The living room needs to be built. You're building. You didn't tell me there was building.

76
00:09:57,029 --> 00:10:01,350
No, living room has to. What's that? The floor has renovating. We're trying to make this

77
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:07,590
a nice place to live in. Okay. Left trigger, right trigger. Oh my God. And Jerma controls the

78
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:13,350
camera. No, no, no, no, no, no. Whoever controls that whoever controls the blue camera has control

79
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:20,230
the camera. But what the hell paint the walls red. Okay. How do we do that? All right. I've got paint.

80
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:24,779
Okay. I took a door off. So it's X to do that. And how do you paint?

81
00:10:25,659 --> 00:10:33,019
Um, we have to have paints to paint. I figured out how to take off doors. How do you pick stuff up?

82
00:10:33,019 --> 00:10:37,980
We don't have any more paint. This is pain right here. Oh, okay. So you only can get

83
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:44,279
what you guys are already dead. I spilled it. How do you clean up this paint? What do you mean?

84
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:53,750
We're dead. All right. Well, you how do you recycle? What are you doing? Why are you riot shielding?

85
00:10:54,710 --> 00:11:01,059
I'm beating the door. All right. Will you go take the blueprint? If we don't do this in two

86
00:11:01,059 --> 00:11:06,659
minutes. How do we hook the doors up? We have 2.7 minutes. You press the bottom button. I don't know

87
00:11:06,659 --> 00:11:13,299
what controller you're using. The A on the Xbox. You guys have Xbox? Yeah. I got an Xbox. Paint. I

88
00:11:13,299 --> 00:11:20,740
asked for one for Christmas. And I got one. Okay. This is dumb. Oh my God. Okay. That's you doing

89
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:26,820
that. Oh my God. That's me doing it. I'm learning. We all had to do it once. Okay. So how do I get

90
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:31,379
new paint? Where's the tutorial? This is the campaign. This is the tutorial. This kind of

91
00:11:31,379 --> 00:11:36,980
game that doesn't hold your hand. Are we out of? You need to turn it so we can see the other side.

92
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:41,700
Why am I holding a big milk carton? All right. Go. Oh my God. Don't let me have these. How do I

93
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:48,820
draw? I'm done. We have to paint. Okay. Okay. I have a new idea. I'll be the foreman. No. What the

94
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:55,799
fuck? There's three of us. Pick a room. Wait. How do you, how do you pick? Thank you. No.

95
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:03,159
Put it over there. This room needs to. No. Do we just have to paint the living room? When I go up

96
00:12:03,159 --> 00:12:10,279
to either of you. Yeah. I think we have to flip so we can see the wall. Go up to the star. Come

97
00:12:10,279 --> 00:12:18,759
on. Paint can. Hold X on the paint can. Which one? You don't know who you are? What are you

98
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:27,960
talking about? You've got a red hat. I've got an orange hat and German's got a green germ hat.

99
00:12:28,759 --> 00:12:40,700
Yes. We did this. This is just a guessing game. No, it's not. You have red paint and you paint.

100
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:47,779
We just, okay. We went tidy up, get rid of all the trash. What about, okay. It says recycle,

101
00:12:47,779 --> 00:12:53,190
but what are we recycling? How do you throw stuff and pick stuff up? My guy refuses.

102
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:03,700
Clean up, clean up, clean up. He just shakes his head. A throws. Pick that paint can up.

103
00:13:04,419 --> 00:13:10,100
How? A and then use, that's how you throw. Why did you kick me out of the house?

104
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:18,460
Because no one knows what's happening. We still did it. Which one of these is you?

105
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:23,500
You. I'm the little guy with the German I'd hate five branded helmet on.

106
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:27,179
Well, then who's me? I don't know. I don't remember. You got to switch like five times.

107
00:13:28,379 --> 00:13:38,580
Look, there are your controls right there. They're gone. I got a solid state drive.

108
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:41,940
There's not enough time to read those controls. All right. Let me be the one to help you here.

109
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:53,129
A picks up. Xbox controls. A picks up. B throws. X holding X does every option. B. Which one's D?

110
00:13:53,129 --> 00:13:59,100
B as in bury. It's right there. There's only two buttons in the game. Just to pick up,

111
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:06,059
put down, hold to collect, throw with B. There are only three buttons. There's three buttons.

112
00:14:06,059 --> 00:14:09,340
Well, now we know what they do. What are we supposed to do now? Now you. Okay.

113
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:14,230
Get the blueprint. I can't get out of this, by the way. You just can hold me forever.

114
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:29,450
You just hear a bully. Okay. Living room. Living room. Needs floors. Which one's the living room?

115
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:35,210
The living room needs walls painted. All right. We got to clean up the paint.

116
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:39,049
We got to recycle the rubbish. We got to use the buckets to put the rubbish away.

117
00:14:39,049 --> 00:14:45,210
No, it does need floors. Yeah. Clean shit up. Okay. All right. I volunteer. What is this one?

118
00:14:46,009 --> 00:14:50,889
I'll just be the foreman and I'll stand over here and make sure you're all doing it right.

119
00:14:50,889 --> 00:14:54,330
All right. Pick stuff up and put it in the bucket. Just clean. Just help us clean.

120
00:14:56,779 --> 00:15:01,740
No, don't throw it over it out of bounds. Listen, I've been playing with Nintendo

121
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:07,500
controllers lately. Who the fuck is this guy? This carpet guy. Oh, he's got the carpet.

122
00:15:08,789 --> 00:15:13,269
All right. It goes in this room, right? Look, look, look. We can really speed this up

123
00:15:13,269 --> 00:15:19,029
officially. I think we have to roll this. Are you awake? Yeah, I'm a foreman. I think he's

124
00:15:19,029 --> 00:15:25,990
not playing. I'm playing. He's not moving. Have you ever been on a construction site before?

125
00:15:26,629 --> 00:15:29,830
All right. Look, look, look. We're going to speed this up. Pick that up.

126
00:15:30,549 --> 00:15:44,019
It's desperately telling you. What? I can't. No, I can't. Yeah. Yeah, they're still doing it.

127
00:15:44,019 --> 00:15:52,220
You totally can't. That's what this is here for. Hey, which one's the living room and which one's

128
00:15:52,220 --> 00:16:03,590
the kitchen? Put the bucket down. Yeah, they're still doing it. What? Okay. You're stepping in

129
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:12,309
your own dog poop. We have two minutes to figure this out. That's not a lot of time.

130
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:16,470
I'm going to be the foreman now. Yes. The carpet needs to be rolled in this room.

131
00:16:17,269 --> 00:16:23,750
Stop. Just look at small Luigi Wario. Okay. He, Italics is a shitty foreman. Okay. I'm sorry. I

132
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:30,759
just had to get that out of my system. All right. Okay. We have a carpet now. How do we roll this?

133
00:16:31,879 --> 00:16:40,860
I think we do. We need help. So you can order stuff. Oh, there we go. All right. You can see

134
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:46,460
progress. We're five percent done in the living room. Take, take. Oh my God. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

135
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:51,340
Put it down. You can't tell what's happening when you're blueprinting us, you stupid shitty foreman.

136
00:16:51,659 --> 00:16:58,440
Bathroom we were dealing with. Put carpets in the bathroom. Cowards. Why is, why is my character

137
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:02,360
just shaking her head? No, because you're standing on the square. You're supposed to

138
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:06,599
be styling. Because someone has to tell you no. Well, don't you have to stand on it and put it

139
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:15,859
down? I can't not stand on it. What button? All right. What color do the rooms need to be?

140
00:17:15,859 --> 00:17:24,500
Does one need to be orange? Okay. I'll be, I'll be the foreman. I don't know what the foreman does.

141
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:28,339
The kitchen. It just tells you what needs to happen. Okay. So this should be orange.

142
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:35,559
Kitchen needs to be painted. Orange. The living room needs to be yellow. How do you tell what room

143
00:17:35,559 --> 00:17:41,460
is what? So the living room is done, right? Yeah. Now it needs to be orange. Walls in the living

144
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:47,940
room too? Ugly. Oh, yellow. Yellow walls. Yellow walls on the right, orange on the top. I'm doing

145
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:53,140
the orange on the top. I spilled it. What kind of fucking McDonald's play pen house is this?

146
00:17:53,299 --> 00:18:03,190
I haven't learned the buttons yet. Can someone clean this up? Play, play probs.

147
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:11,750
You're doing a great job, Star. Walking back and forth from room to room. You're doing great.

148
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:20,710
It's good. Now X, hold X and then hold X. I'm doing it, daddy. How come you can only paint once per

149
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:31,900
hour? Because it's part of the video game. We got seven seconds. What? What? We're 89%. Clean it

150
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:35,420
up. Just clean it up. Clean, clean. There's no carpet there. How is there no carpet in that

151
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:43,500
corner? We did it. One star. It was placed in blocks. That doesn't make any sense. That does

152
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:52,420
actually not make any sense. But you ever like malicious compliance? No. Just put it down. Who

153
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:57,940
cares? Somebody else's problem now. Oh, yeah. Yeah. That's my life. Let them put it together.

154
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:06,549
We'll just leave the paint cans there. The carpet. He's a Redditor. Shut up. Found out.

155
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:13,779
I can't believe we got 10 stars on that last one. Yeah. If you multiply by 10, I think I learned

156
00:19:13,779 --> 00:19:29,299
the buttons. It scared everybody. I'm sorry. Let me go. I'm trying to shortcut you. Oh,

157
00:19:29,299 --> 00:19:33,380
that's actually pretty good. Listen to me, everybody. We got it in the living room. We

158
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:37,940
got to put down the floor. But first you have to use the gardening tool on it.

159
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:45,670
The floor has to come in first through the mail. And then you have to paint the wall orange.

160
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:49,430
What do we have to do for that? Okay. So we need binding of Isaac damage plus what?

161
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:54,890
That's the binding of Isaac damage. No, that's like the gardener. You have to dig up

162
00:19:56,599 --> 00:20:06,259
something to plant. Okay. The bucket is definitely supposed to hold access. Yeah,

163
00:20:06,259 --> 00:20:13,180
it does. It holds trash. But how do you put it in there? Here, put it down.

164
00:20:15,109 --> 00:20:21,339
It's A to put it in. All right. All right. All right. Here's the carpet. We haven't finished

165
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:28,779
moving this. Here, here, here, here. Yeah, there. See? Let's get it going. It's going to put trash

166
00:20:28,779 --> 00:20:34,059
in here. Wait, look how fast this is. Oh, that is pretty fast. All right. So what this wall needs

167
00:20:34,059 --> 00:20:42,980
to be orange, right? Uh, no, no, no, not orange. That's okay. This one's orange. I think so. Yeah.

168
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:47,299
Where the carpet guy go. Well, it depends which one is the kitchen and which one's the living room.

169
00:20:48,339 --> 00:20:58,440
Get to the door. He's ringing the doorbell. Is he going to help? Okay. I'll be doing it.

170
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:06,920
He was about to leave again. Thank you. That actually helped. I'm, I'm the foreman. All right.

171
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:11,819
There's yellow paint coming in. Yellow paint just arrived. All right. This room's done.

172
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:18,859
I'm bringing you the yellow paint. Okay. Good. All right. In the carpet. Thank you.

173
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:25,259
We have to designate jobs. That's how this works. Well, I mean, we're doing that kind of honestly.

174
00:21:25,259 --> 00:21:32,220
I can't paint this room. I'm willing to bet we get paid by the hour. Which room has to be yellow?

175
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:40,140
The top left one. Hey, but furniture delivery gets paid ahead of time. Oh, you got to peel the

176
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:47,720
wallpaper off. Shit. All right. I need that bucket. Throw that bucket in here. I'm getting it. All

177
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:52,460
right. I got the carpet done in the main room. What have you done? Trash bucket. I painted all

178
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:57,019
the walls. All right. Put it down. Trash. Trash bucket. Yeah. You have to peel the walls off.

179
00:21:57,019 --> 00:22:08,039
Metallica. Get on it. I am already on it. He's already here. Get on it. All right. Get on that.

180
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:15,349
You're in the room doing the job. When you do that, it changes our controls just to let you

181
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:20,230
please don't do that. I'm doing it so that you can get the walls you haven't gotten.

182
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:24,869
I'm doing it intelligently. What about this one? You know nothing about.

183
00:22:24,869 --> 00:22:32,869
Go this way. Hey. Wow. You spilled it everywhere. It's all right. It'll take two seconds to clean

184
00:22:32,869 --> 00:22:44,839
it up. I really I didn't learn the buttons yet. I figured it out. I got it. I need to be very real

185
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:50,839
here. How how is it possible that you don't understand x and a dude? What this every time

186
00:22:50,839 --> 00:22:58,759
I go to do something, I press the wrong one. Well, it's just it's a to pick up x to interact.

187
00:22:58,759 --> 00:23:06,549
It's a pick up x interact. I mean, even I can figure that out. You're really downplaying yourself

188
00:23:06,549 --> 00:23:12,710
there. You went to college. We got 91%. What are we missing? Of course you would know how to do that.

189
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:18,869
That the right wall, the right bucket, right wall. No, the right wrong with the right wall.

190
00:23:18,869 --> 00:23:27,990
No, get out. I get my I want to get the glory. Oops. Wrong way. Right wall. No, we're good.

191
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:31,670
So what's wrong? We're missing the kitchen. The kitchen's all messed up.

192
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:38,390
It's the walls. We need to peel the paper or something. What is it? Yeah, it's not yellow.

193
00:23:39,109 --> 00:23:45,670
Are we missing something? Spin it around. Not yellow. Spin the walls. Wait. Oh, shit. What the

194
00:23:45,670 --> 00:23:52,650
hell is it? What? What? Oh, shit. Those are those are. Oh, thank God. They looked yellow.

195
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:56,970
They looked yellow. I'm with you. The people who they're just gonna have to pay us.

196
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:04,410
Like they're the ones that want to be shadow under 120 seconds. I think that's a little

197
00:24:05,529 --> 00:24:16,230
extreme. Damn. One star Redditor. Hey, when are we going to get our first three star review on Yelp?

198
00:24:16,869 --> 00:24:24,359
Not until Star figures out how to press X and A separately. I'm learning. You feel like this

199
00:24:24,359 --> 00:24:29,670
should be on a 3D plane, but it's not. It's just left and right. We're gonna go in the elevator.

200
00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:35,670
You technically can go forward and back. It's just I'm going in. You need six stars to reach

201
00:24:35,670 --> 00:24:43,269
this floor. What are we getting Mario 64 right now? Yeah, we didn't do good enough. Get good.

202
00:24:43,269 --> 00:24:48,309
You one started all three of the first levels. No, we didn't. We go. Yeah, we did. No, we only

203
00:24:48,309 --> 00:24:53,990
got one star on every. We only got a single star. You know what? In this day and age,

204
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:58,230
that means we're willing to work for the least amount of money. All right. I'm on trash. I'm

205
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:01,910
on trash. I'm on trash. Do something else. I'm on trash. Get out of the way. Oh my God.

206
00:25:04,569 --> 00:25:07,529
Okay, I'll be the former. Take that in there. I'm on trash.

207
00:25:09,319 --> 00:25:16,680
Which button? You not know the button. Okay. Are you all right? Have you eaten today?

208
00:25:18,069 --> 00:25:22,789
Yes. All right. I'm the former. We need yellow walls, rights, orange walls, top.

209
00:25:24,869 --> 00:25:32,420
Is there any more trash? No more trash. Okay. I'm emptying this.

210
00:25:35,849 --> 00:25:43,109
Hi. Did you just like smoke weed like an hour ago? No, no, I wouldn't do that. Oh, weed jokes.

211
00:25:44,309 --> 00:25:52,059
Okay. You guys seeing what's going on here? All right. Good. I'm getting the carpet. Carpet.

212
00:25:52,059 --> 00:25:56,859
Ding dong. Are we ready for carpet to go in the room?

213
00:25:57,579 --> 00:26:01,319
Which button is the carpet? Pay no attention to it. I need two more walls.

214
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:10,920
I'll just start doing carpet. All right. Walls should be done. We also need to make sure that

215
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:15,460
it actually goes all the way. I know what happened. Somebody went like this last time.

216
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:23,220
That's what happened. Oh, that was 100%. I can't select the carpet. Somebody went like what?

217
00:26:24,339 --> 00:26:27,700
If you don't hold it all the way, if you don't have enough carpet to do the whole place,

218
00:26:28,339 --> 00:26:32,740
it doesn't, you'll miss a spot. Everyone loves holding the button. You're like a no man's sky.

219
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:36,900
You have to hold the button for every menu. Like, Oh, I want to change my brightness. Hold the.

220
00:26:37,779 --> 00:26:42,259
Yeah. I actually, I agree. I disagree. I do. It should just be one input. All right. Tidy up.

221
00:26:42,259 --> 00:26:48,819
We got that. That's three stars. Let's go. Who is who? I said, no one asked passively.

222
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:54,410
I was throwing away all this carpet. Tidy up for left.

223
00:26:54,809 --> 00:27:04,869
Oh shit. Clean that up. There's like a Cheeto puff coming out of this can. That's it. Right.

224
00:27:04,869 --> 00:27:10,630
You have to tidy up. Close the door. That's the carpet on left. Yeah. It's

225
00:27:12,759 --> 00:27:21,740
a button is stun locked over here. Please. Got it. We unlocked a new character. I want to be Otter

226
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:31,779
boy. All right. When I asked my chat, what kind of gay animal I was, they said I was an Otter.

227
00:27:31,779 --> 00:27:43,880
How do I change? What's wrong with you? Okay. Now everyone won't mistake that I am the Otter.

228
00:27:46,940 --> 00:28:01,779
Okay. Okay. Ready? Yeah. Do we have enough stars to go upstairs? No, we have three and one and one.

229
00:28:01,779 --> 00:28:11,289
We have six. So what is that? How many does that add up to? I can't, where am I? Three and one and

230
00:28:11,289 --> 00:28:17,700
one. We three, four, five, six. Oh no. Oh, we do have six. Let's go. What are you guys doing?

231
00:28:18,809 --> 00:28:29,269
Ooh, that was solid. We're going up. Why did it go back down? Going up because apparently we all

232
00:28:29,269 --> 00:28:36,500
have control of it. I press down. All right. We gotta get a three star on this one. Okay. So it's

233
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:46,579
A to press up or put down or. Yeah. Hold on. Hold on. We have to dump cement or shellac,

234
00:28:46,579 --> 00:28:52,180
whatever it is, into a bucket. And then we shellac the walls. Yeah. Stick the circuit boards in there.

235
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:58,680
Put your fork directly into the socket. Open the door. Oh, do you know what button it was? Yeah.

236
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:06,119
Talk shit. Get hit. I just didn't push the button is all. Okay. Here's the, so we go. So shellac

237
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:11,000
into the bucket and then hang on. Do you want to look at the plans first? Whatever we know what

238
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:20,259
we're doing. Yeah. Shellac. Okay. Okay. Uh, cause it's orange left yellow top. Yeah, but we got a

239
00:29:20,259 --> 00:29:33,289
shellac first to get rid of this brick. Okay. I'm refilled the shellac delivery. I got it. Uh, do you?

240
00:29:34,309 --> 00:29:41,740
Yo, what's this house? Why is this the neighbor? Do I just, do we steal our neighbor's fucking

241
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:48,759
sherbet? What is the, I don't understand. Yo, what's in the, uh, what's in the ice cooler?

242
00:29:51,299 --> 00:29:58,089
What, what walls have to be, um, orange? These ones top right. Top right is orange yellow

243
00:29:58,890 --> 00:30:04,890
and then left is orange. Is it? Yeah. Well, you can look at the walls. Yeah. Hang on.

244
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:10,380
Hold on. Wait, wait. I have to steal more ice cream from my neighbor. All right. You get it.

245
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:20,490
Fixed it. What is it? Just grab it out of his hand. Two spots up here. Embarrassing. There might even

246
00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:26,569
be more. I can't see cause the person left the blueprints all the way outside the house. They're

247
00:30:26,569 --> 00:30:34,630
saying we fucked it. You fucked it. You fucked it. What? What happened? All right. I'm doing some

248
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:47,109
rotations. Hold your pants. Who's going to get the carpet delivery? I'm going. Why did they deliver

249
00:30:47,109 --> 00:30:54,200
to the wrong address? I don't know. Maybe that is the, why would this is, I have no idea. I think

250
00:30:54,200 --> 00:31:02,390
this is the second house we're making over the wrong house. These people are just like on vacation.

251
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:10,019
It's yellow carpet in here, right? I hope so. All right. What is it? I need, I need this. I don't

252
00:31:10,019 --> 00:31:15,619
know. Where's the trash. We also need to, um, kind of have to rotate. All right. I got paint orange

253
00:31:15,619 --> 00:31:24,819
in here. Orange. Yep. I just make sure I shell act. Okay. We'll just paint over it. They won't even

254
00:31:24,819 --> 00:31:34,619
know. The people that are going to know the people that own this house 30 years from now,

255
00:31:34,619 --> 00:31:39,259
they're going to peel back three layers of wallpaper. Yes. And underneath it, I will have

256
00:31:39,259 --> 00:31:47,940
signed my name and then, and we'll find the bones in the basement. I somehow knew that's where that

257
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:52,579
was going. I knew that's where that was going. All right. How are we doing? I'm flipping it.

258
00:31:53,140 --> 00:32:00,069
That's a better view. All right. We need the, uh, we need carpet over here. Yep. No,

259
00:32:00,069 --> 00:32:04,500
something else is better. We need carpet in here. Yeah. No, no, no, no. It's already here.

260
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:11,140
What's missing from the lip? What's missing from the living room? Uh, there probably is one wall.

261
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:14,500
There's one wall that's fucked up. It's one. You're like, it's right in front of this one here.

262
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:20,900
I got it. Oh, I got it. I got it. Don't worry. Don't even worry about it. I got that.

263
00:32:21,859 --> 00:32:27,819
Man, I wish it would individually score us. You can see how good I'm doing. Wrong. Wrong.

264
00:32:29,130 --> 00:32:34,970
Well, paint over it. Can I say I've got that three times. Then you just let me fucking get it.

265
00:32:35,609 --> 00:32:39,529
I was, I know I did just, we were just playing baseball and I was a center fielder.

266
00:32:39,529 --> 00:32:43,450
Cause I can't just repaint it. You called the ball and I just fucking ran in front of you and

267
00:32:43,450 --> 00:32:46,809
tried to get it and we smashed into each other and it's a highlight reel on ESPN. I know. I

268
00:32:46,809 --> 00:32:52,660
understand. Just fix it. That's it. The bones are going to be you.

269
00:32:53,940 --> 00:33:01,059
So what is this? Like, uh, what's the ice cream bucket for? Uh, that was the shellac. Oh.

270
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:11,380
Steal their bathtub. And instead we had to do anything about them. All right.

271
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:17,940
There's only one door left. What is it? It's been us. Two left. Go shut all the doors. Three stars.

272
00:33:19,529 --> 00:33:24,680
God, I'm working with amateurs. Really? Cause you just figured out how to use the buttons.

273
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:37,779
This level needs up there. How do you delete somebody else's entire Twitch account?

274
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:47,430
I'm working on it. Wait, did I pick the wrong same one? This is same one. Quit to desktop.

275
00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:53,109
No, that would be bad. That would kill three games. That would kill three different streams.

276
00:33:54,920 --> 00:34:01,779
I'm shocked that, uh, Cox is holding this. I know seriously, I can't believe it.

277
00:34:02,579 --> 00:34:08,980
All right. Who wants to do what? Shellac. Wait, I got it. I'm going to blueprint. You blueprint.

278
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:16,570
No, I'm going to blueprint. You blueprint. What button is it? Hey, when somebody says they have

279
00:34:16,570 --> 00:34:22,809
something. Okay. Look, look pink in that room. Remember pink in that room, orange in those left

280
00:34:22,809 --> 00:34:27,050
room. All right. So we need to, we have things to do first. We're going to tear shit down.

281
00:34:28,809 --> 00:34:31,690
We need a trash. The trash is right here.

282
00:34:31,690 --> 00:34:37,139
No, no, no. That's the shellac. That's shellac bucket. That's the shellac bucket. We don't have

283
00:34:37,139 --> 00:34:43,460
any other. Hang on. We did this wrong. What do I have in my hand? Shellac. How do I shellac?

284
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:50,460
The front room needs to be shellac. We fucked it all up. Just restart it. Where's the trash bucket?

285
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:55,989
I put shellac in the trash bucket because that we only get one bucket. All right. Tear down

286
00:34:55,989 --> 00:35:11,000
and put in bucket. Do we need the sofa? Um, okay. You guys are doing a great job there.

287
00:35:14,730 --> 00:35:25,400
Good teamwork. Okay. All right. It is a trash. Uh, star's only using one hand. So yeah. Um,

288
00:35:26,519 --> 00:35:35,019
can somebody help me? I'm back. Can I get through? I, he blocked me in here. Can you bring that

289
00:35:35,019 --> 00:35:43,750
garbage over here? I'm trying to dump it. Uh, it really used some garbage. Uh, all right. What's,

290
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:49,349
what, how are we doing? What's, what's going on in the kitchen in the kitchen is just orange walls.

291
00:35:49,349 --> 00:35:56,460
You got it. Okay. Orange paint is hidden in the secret garden. All right. I'll take it. I'll take

292
00:35:56,460 --> 00:36:03,179
it. No, no, no. I was already there when you called me. All right. Sorry. Ready for shellac

293
00:36:03,179 --> 00:36:07,989
to go dump that bucket. And then we got to shellac that bucket. I don't, I don't remember how to

294
00:36:07,989 --> 00:36:14,519
shellac honestly. I'll do what you said. I can tell you right now. It's, it's either X or a,

295
00:36:14,519 --> 00:36:20,099
I'm doing what you said. All right. Bring this back over here. Here we go. Put it down.

296
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:26,780
Now we can, I'm getting a delivery. Is that a couch? That's a new couch. Is this a new like

297
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:32,679
Ikea couch we have to put? No, this is tiles for this front room. I don't know how to. All right.

298
00:36:32,679 --> 00:36:41,860
This room's done. Um, what, what, what next boss? Um, I don't know. Well, what, what color do these

299
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:48,099
walls be orange? Paper is right up there in your room. All right. So yellow tiles in here,

300
00:36:48,099 --> 00:36:58,039
carpet up top. We've read, but how do we do the tile? You just put it down. There's that red

301
00:36:58,039 --> 00:37:05,369
carpet. Are you sure you just, how do we put the, how do we put this? How do we put it down?

302
00:37:05,369 --> 00:37:10,010
Yeah. Well, it's either X or a J. It's going to be one of those. I can't get this might be like,

303
00:37:10,010 --> 00:37:15,530
I can't remove whatever's in my hand. He's leaving. He doesn't. Oh my God. Every button,

304
00:37:15,530 --> 00:37:18,889
I'm pressing everything. I won't get this thing out of my hand. Gotta shellac the floor. Gotta

305
00:37:18,889 --> 00:37:24,550
shellac the floor. Somebody was just in the way. No, you gotta shellac the floor. Do you? Wait,

306
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:30,760
I can't walk over this. Oh, fuck. Here. What are we doing? No, we have to shellac the floor. Here,

307
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:35,860
take the bucket. See, it's Alex. You can't get this out of your hand. How do you get it out of

308
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:47,110
your hand? Okay. Put A into the bucket. Recycling full? No, there's shellac in that bucket. I can't

309
00:37:47,110 --> 00:37:56,820
walk over there. All right. You need, wait, somebody get the door. We all run over to get.

310
00:37:56,820 --> 00:38:06,860
I'm going to shellac you in a second. Okay. Keep in mind, when you shellac, you can't walk on it

311
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:15,099
for like 10 seconds. Why did you throw everything in here? God. Okay. Why is, why are the tiles up

312
00:38:15,099 --> 00:38:19,610
in the top row? Because he's been, he's throwing them. All right. Here's what we got to do. We

313
00:38:19,610 --> 00:38:28,070
got to, you got to tile. Corner out. I didn't throw the tile. What? Can't walk on that. Are you

314
00:38:28,070 --> 00:38:33,000
picking this up from me? No, no, no. You have to shellac the ground and you can't walk on the

315
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:38,360
floor until it's done. I know. I'm being very patient. I'm just going to watch you guys. 40

316
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:47,909
seconds. I can't put this down. Oh fuck. Don't do that. It was the only place. Okay. Thanks.

317
00:38:47,909 --> 00:38:52,869
Why is it in here? Why is everything blamed on me? But it's all italics. All right. I can't move.

318
00:38:52,869 --> 00:39:02,550
Somebody has to do this. Cause you did it first. I just like fell down in real life.

319
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:14,280
I like slipped and I tripped and I, my control unplugged. All right. No. God damn it.

320
00:39:16,889 --> 00:39:23,050
We got eight seconds. This is bad news. We can do this one. There was a new game mechanic. How

321
00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:32,059
are we supposed to know? Wow. That's a zero star. I mean, you're only as strong as your weakest link.

322
00:39:32,139 --> 00:39:41,059
I was the last to fall. I wish they individually scored us. Go that way. I could prove was he ever

323
00:39:41,059 --> 00:39:46,420
heard he who smelted Delta. You are protesting quite a lot right now. Unprovoked. Pick a room.

324
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:54,710
Pick a room. Everybody pick a room. Pick a room. I'm just trying to do my job. And Alex is talking

325
00:39:54,710 --> 00:40:00,469
about far. I'm in this room already. Did you not hear what I just said out loud in front of like

326
00:40:00,469 --> 00:40:08,900
60,000 people? Hey, who's player one? I don't know. What button is it? Okay. I need that back.

327
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:21,190
Toss that over here. Thank you. Uh, is that couch actually supposed to come out?

328
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:32,090
Probably because you can make it makes it easier. No, it's not. I mean, it would make it easier.

329
00:40:35,579 --> 00:40:39,260
Yeah. I think we just have to move it out of the way. All right. Somebody help me move the couch

330
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:49,849
out of the way. There you go. There you go. All right. Now we shall act. I will dump this

331
00:40:49,849 --> 00:40:58,949
bucket. It looks right in front when I was to pick it up. I don't know what to do. This isn't

332
00:40:58,949 --> 00:41:06,860
realistic. It's not going when you drag it. That's because there's good movers. We already put the

333
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:13,000
little cushions underneath each leg. I don't know what to do. Someone give me a task.

334
00:41:13,239 --> 00:41:13,800
All right.

335
00:41:21,159 --> 00:41:26,619
We have to show you to shellac these walls with the bucket of shellac. No, you don't. That's a lie.

336
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:30,860
I lied. Uh, you have to do that in the other room down here. No, no, no. That's also a lie.

337
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:36,860
Yeah. Do this in here. You shall lack the floor. Yes. So lack the floor. Use this bucket. You can.

338
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:44,219
Okay. We'll do it. Do it in an order that we don't have to walk. I need that paint door.

339
00:41:45,019 --> 00:41:56,469
It's Alex door. Well, it's Alex. I can't move. Thank you. I was a fucking, that was a good play.

340
00:41:57,030 --> 00:42:04,389
I locked you. I locked me out. I'm being, um, I'm being hampered. Sometimes it has to happen.

341
00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:09,190
Okay. We're totally shellacked in here. There's a traitor amongst us.

342
00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:14,550
Pick up the shellac. It probably works for a rival moving company. Oh my God. I do.

343
00:42:15,510 --> 00:42:21,260
I took you. Hey, what are you doing here? Five missions to figure it out.

344
00:42:22,139 --> 00:42:28,070
Did delivery guy just throw that? Or did you throw that? He walked into it and moved it.

345
00:42:28,949 --> 00:42:34,070
Okay. We've got this paint that needs to come in here. All right. This couch is done.

346
00:42:34,710 --> 00:42:41,750
Pink paint needs to go up on the walls. Carpet done. Yep. Let's get, I'll get this out of here.

347
00:42:42,469 --> 00:42:52,489
Pink paint. And then we got to tile this floor. All right. Tiling is going to come last.

348
00:42:53,909 --> 00:42:58,230
What about the orange paint? You guys already do that? I got orange in the left room.

349
00:42:58,230 --> 00:43:01,269
All right. Let's let me check the blueprint. And I got pink in the top room.

350
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:08,219
Just the living room. That's it. Living room. We got to tile this room.

351
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:14,139
I didn't know that I couldn't walk over the tile. I completed it. We're good. Tidy up.

352
00:43:14,139 --> 00:43:23,260
Start taking things outdoors. I got the tile. We got to move the couch back. Don't we?

353
00:43:23,980 --> 00:43:30,150
Oh, I think it should be fine. Move, move, move, move, move.

354
00:43:33,190 --> 00:43:37,349
Where's the red? Get him in the same room. That's you're walking pretty far to do that.

355
00:43:39,130 --> 00:43:42,809
Now you can't get out. It's a 200 IQ play because we did two at the same time.

356
00:43:42,809 --> 00:43:46,489
Yeah. But now he can't leave. Shut that door. Yeah. See, I got to shut the door anyway.

357
00:43:47,289 --> 00:43:52,010
That's what I'm saying. Now he can't leave. He can't leave. He did it the wrong. He did it

358
00:43:52,010 --> 00:44:00,650
from the wrong side. I didn't do that. Who did that? What? Wait, don't you left the tiles?

359
00:44:01,449 --> 00:44:16,900
No, no, it's not worth it. Throw it out. Oh, almost. That was close. Look at my whiskers.

360
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:26,980
Can we go up the next floor? Are we allowed to go up yet? I knew that was the first thing I knew

361
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:30,900
it was going to happen. I'm supposed to be in control right now. It's not fair.

362
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:37,670
Oh wow. We all got an achievement unlock except only German gets it. The greedy guy that he is.

363
00:44:37,670 --> 00:44:40,469
I think we just broke the game. I don't think we're supposed to be up here. So you need 15

364
00:44:40,469 --> 00:44:44,869
stars to be able to be allowed up here. Maybe we have exactly 15 stars to be up here. We're

365
00:44:44,869 --> 00:44:56,099
doing great. Oh boy. All right. Why are they delivering to us in a moat? All that stuff is

366
00:44:56,099 --> 00:45:01,539
ruined. Important stuff coming down the river. Oh man. This is getting to the point where you

367
00:45:01,539 --> 00:45:10,250
have to try, isn't it? All these sweaty try hard games. We have to try now. Wait, what did I just

368
00:45:10,250 --> 00:45:14,650
do? I just wanted a relaxing game where I could chat with my friends and they have to turn it

369
00:45:14,650 --> 00:45:21,900
into like an exercise. You know, games are supposed to be like enjoyable. It's funny coming from the

370
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:29,190
e-sports player. Who's that? Oh, I accidentally pressed the wrong button and now I have this

371
00:45:29,190 --> 00:45:33,429
handful of paint that I can't do anything about until the paint comes around again.

372
00:45:34,469 --> 00:45:41,019
All right. What room do we start in? Imagine your house is made of grass. All right. We should

373
00:45:41,019 --> 00:45:46,139
probably just restart right now. This room sucks. It's the ugliest fucking room I've ever seen. We

374
00:45:46,139 --> 00:45:55,099
don't have a single tool. All right. Restart it. Restart it. Restart it. No, you try hard.

375
00:45:56,460 --> 00:46:10,039
We've been sitting around for a full minute. I was doing shit. All right. I have saved.

376
00:46:10,599 --> 00:46:16,710
Just made a second pile. Okay. Trash, trash, trash, trash, trash, trash, trash.

377
00:46:17,349 --> 00:46:27,400
We got to shellac this room. You got to put a carpet in that room. Which room?

378
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:31,320
Hang on. We got more stuff coming down the pipe. Bring some deliveries out here.

379
00:46:32,119 --> 00:46:38,579
All right. House is clean. We got to shellac this patio. Shellac the patio. You got it. Let's go.

380
00:46:38,579 --> 00:46:46,280
Tear it up. Which room needs to be yellow or orange? This one. This one, which also needs to

381
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:50,760
be shellac. I can't get through the carpet. I don't like this shellacking mechanic right now,

382
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:57,880
I got to say. Well, it's only going to get harder from here. So I, what did you do? Okay. Well,

383
00:46:57,880 --> 00:47:03,780
hey, could you open the door for me, please? This is mine. And this one. Thank you.

384
00:47:06,019 --> 00:47:10,420
What goes on the patio? The tiles? Have they been delivered by the moat yet or no?

385
00:47:13,820 --> 00:47:18,940
Do tiles last? Go up there. Hopes. I'm murdered.

386
00:47:25,059 --> 00:47:29,880
Delete the ladder. Make him suffer. Okay. One button. I love this.

387
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:37,900
All right. We need to turn this. Well, a secret carpet in here.

388
00:47:38,699 --> 00:47:47,300
There's still a couple of things I need to throw in that bucket. Okay. Do it. Well,

389
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:52,739
you want the carpet to go. I think the carpet goes in on the patio where the pool is.

390
00:47:53,699 --> 00:47:58,980
What? Living room, kitchen, patio, carpet. I think it's actually patio carpet.

391
00:48:00,179 --> 00:48:04,420
How do I shellac these? What? No, you did this. No, you just have to pull them up.

392
00:48:05,139 --> 00:48:14,469
Now. Okay. The shellac is for another room. Okay. I'm losing it, dude. The kitchen

393
00:48:15,510 --> 00:48:19,590
needs to have orange paint and needs to be shellacked and orange paint. I will go start

394
00:48:19,590 --> 00:48:32,500
that process. This is, I believe this is the kitchen. It is not the kitchen. There's one more.

395
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:39,980
You got it. All right. I'm going to take a look at the plants. Kitchen needs to be shellacked.

396
00:48:39,980 --> 00:48:50,780
We need to hit these walls, paste. Does that mean this room's walls are not supposed to be painted

397
00:48:50,780 --> 00:48:58,380
or that one more? All right. We got a bunch of empty blue walls in that bottom right.

398
00:48:58,380 --> 00:49:03,579
What room am I standing in right now? What is it? Was this the, is this the bedroom? What is this?

399
00:49:04,679 --> 00:49:09,880
It's, it's really room. What if I told you that any room could be any room, depending on what

400
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:13,960
furniture you put in. Oh, I, I accidentally brought all of the stuff into this room.

401
00:49:15,239 --> 00:49:18,519
Sorry. Alex is the kind of guy to put carpet on a patio.

402
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:29,099
We got a shellac this wall. Shellac here. He'll put you to fill the shellac bucket.

403
00:49:29,820 --> 00:49:36,119
So we're done with the orange paint, right? I'm going to start cleaning up. Okay. We got a minute

404
00:49:36,119 --> 00:49:42,500
50. We got two times. That's fine. How do I? Oh, okay. You filled it up. Good job.

405
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:46,039
Now we paste. I'm going to check the blueprint. Make sure we didn't miss anything in any of these

406
00:49:46,039 --> 00:49:54,659
other rooms. It's the kitchen is at 0% by the way. How's that possible? Hey, can you improve

407
00:49:54,659 --> 00:50:00,659
your upload speed a little? Why is my upload speed bad? No, it's just, it's like, I think it's just

408
00:50:00,659 --> 00:50:08,889
that screen. It's just being mean. Uh, I was getting like 480 P for a second. Can you make

409
00:50:08,889 --> 00:50:18,630
you like, can you make, can you make our internet better? All right. What do we need to do? That's

410
00:50:18,630 --> 00:50:27,510
not a yellow wall. Is it yellow? No, it's orange. Just paint. Yeah. Yeah. Every time you do the

411
00:50:27,510 --> 00:50:32,949
blueprint screen to me, it's like taking on, putting off glasses, putting on, taking off glass.

412
00:50:33,909 --> 00:50:42,820
Yeah. Putting on, taking off. This wall needs it for the otter spinning. Are we done? That's it.

413
00:50:42,820 --> 00:50:46,500
Tiny up. And you thought this one was going to be hard. We have plenty of time. This one was an

414
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:51,579
easier one. Throw it all in the river. Would they know? I think they know. Do they know?

415
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:59,159
Four left. It comes around to the side. Go up top left, top right, go top right, bottom right.

416
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:05,960
What? It's in the river. I think it counts. Does it count? I got it. I got it. I'll grab it.

417
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:11,239
Well, it's on this side, the bottom right. It's not going to come around. It kept getting flipped.

418
00:51:12,119 --> 00:51:18,070
Is it just you? Wait, am I the trash? Are you? Can you come out of here?

419
00:51:19,590 --> 00:51:29,559
Just shut the door. Oh, it's me. I'm the trash. All right. We got three stars for that one.

420
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:39,139
When did we get our ultimate? I'm sure there'll be another game mechanic. That's interesting. Hold on.

421
00:51:41,539 --> 00:51:49,349
See, unlike games with ultimates, this one's balanced.

422
00:51:49,349 --> 00:51:57,059
Okay. Paints. That didn't mean anything. This game doesn't have ultimates.

423
00:52:01,699 --> 00:52:07,059
Okay. Seriously. I'm going to take a two minute break. I don't want to be a...

424
00:52:07,059 --> 00:52:10,820
Man down, man down, man down. I think I'm going to have a cigarette. I'll be right back.

425
00:52:12,019 --> 00:52:23,769
Where's the junk? Where's the trash? I have the junk at the top left.

426
00:52:24,809 --> 00:52:28,809
Hey, where's the trash? I have the trash at the top left.

427
00:52:35,590 --> 00:52:46,340
Stop removing doors. I need it to be done. It was in the way. Well, I'm just manually

428
00:52:48,380 --> 00:52:56,710
manually going back and forth. How do you put doors back? You just hit A.

429
00:52:57,510 --> 00:53:04,139
Oh, there's three buttons. All right. So the top left needs to be painted.

430
00:53:04,940 --> 00:53:12,309
Hey, just click their head. Okay. Okay. Where is it? Oh, I got a lot of trash in here. You guys

431
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:19,639
have hogged the trash bucket the whole... God damn it. I'm bringing the trash to you now.

432
00:53:19,639 --> 00:53:23,800
You could just like not do trash right now. Or I could just mute and go like

433
00:53:24,679 --> 00:53:29,800
cough for five straight minutes to get this out of me. It's like something in my body.

434
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:34,039
You brought the trash to me. You still walked outside. Can you take commands from anyone?

435
00:53:38,170 --> 00:53:49,300
Don't tell me what to do. You're a stoa. Carpet. Carpet. Top left. So what goes on bottom right?

436
00:53:50,539 --> 00:54:08,309
Green paint. Hold on. Green paint, green tile. Green paint, green tile. Got it. What do you think

437
00:54:08,309 --> 00:54:13,909
this is? All right. This rich asshole who has a tree in his house. Who has a tree in their house

438
00:54:13,909 --> 00:54:26,019
and a moat around the tree. I think it just is the tree's house. This is just where they live.

439
00:54:26,739 --> 00:54:35,659
Do we have to do anything with the floor first? No, it's already. It's already been slapped.

440
00:54:36,460 --> 00:54:48,019
Let's actually. Oh, I'm barred from entry here. Sorry. What's left? That's a trash bin right now.

441
00:54:48,019 --> 00:54:52,380
All right. Let me see. How are we doing? I like how you're not supposed to walk on this,

442
00:54:52,380 --> 00:54:57,260
but as long as you just walk on it first, you're fine. Just that bedroom. This just needs that

443
00:54:57,260 --> 00:55:02,780
carpet. And then that's it. Then tidy up. Start tidying up. What needs carpet? The room he's in

444
00:55:02,780 --> 00:55:11,750
right now. We're done after that. That's not carpet. That's tiles. That's it. Tidy up. Fix

445
00:55:11,750 --> 00:55:23,099
that door. Bedroom. Is it a wall that's not painted in the bedroom? Are you going to throw that real

446
00:55:23,099 --> 00:55:36,380
good? Stop. That's the word. So what are we missing? Which room is it? It's the green room.

447
00:55:36,380 --> 00:55:39,420
There must be one walls. Yeah, that's what I was looking for. And he told me to stop.

448
00:55:40,539 --> 00:55:44,219
One of them. Oh, it's that one. I mean, it looks great. It looks great.

449
00:55:47,670 --> 00:55:52,389
Sorry. Sorry. The guy's in the way who's housework. Hey, I can't see past the tree.

450
00:55:53,110 --> 00:56:07,429
Okay. Here we go. All right. It's five stars. Well done. I don't think you need to close the door.

451
00:56:09,179 --> 00:56:26,309
Oh, dog. Anyone want to be dog? We got the dog looks overpowered. It does kind of.

452
00:56:27,349 --> 00:56:30,309
I've overpowered you mean huge and probably in the way.

453
00:56:31,030 --> 00:56:38,070
So how come I feel disproportionate? I'm the only one who can paint tall walls and reach.

454
00:56:38,550 --> 00:56:47,610
Stop going down. Nobody's doing that on purpose. Yes, he is. What do you mean?

455
00:56:48,329 --> 00:56:55,530
I'm not doing it. I'm going to get blamed and it's him. It's not me. There's no way that's not

456
00:56:55,530 --> 00:57:00,969
being done on purpose. It could be German. He doesn't know. All right. What do we have to do?

457
00:57:01,929 --> 00:57:06,760
It's done. Hey, let me move this. Let's move the chaise lounge.

458
00:57:10,179 --> 00:57:18,090
That room needs blue carpet. This room needs tile and that's it. That's it.

459
00:57:19,269 --> 00:57:26,469
Is it? Yeah. That's it. I mean, it's a huge room though. I think it's because it's so separated.

460
00:57:26,469 --> 00:57:29,349
Let's wait for delivery. There's a big wall right there. We'll start pulling it up.

461
00:57:29,909 --> 00:57:39,110
We got to like throw stuff. I got the chalacum. Get out of here. All right. So we have

462
00:57:39,190 --> 00:57:45,980
to start pulling up tile. Oh, there's a secret slipper there. We need that trash bucket in here.

463
00:57:45,980 --> 00:57:51,139
We need to work together ripping it up. Somebody said only one room in this house is actually

464
00:57:51,139 --> 00:58:03,400
inside. What? Because he's a tree bathroom. It's got to be the case. You've got to set it down.

465
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:19,559
Not whip it. Everyone get prepared. Carpet. Get that excellent German on 85 branded carpet.

466
00:58:24,460 --> 00:58:30,550
All right. We basically just have to throw stuff over the wall a lot. I think it's raining and

467
00:58:30,550 --> 00:58:38,630
it's making random things on the ground. Yeah. This person's house is outside. Yeah. What a shitty

468
00:58:38,630 --> 00:58:46,179
house. Nothing we can do to save it. All right. Do we need trash in any other room? I don't think

469
00:58:46,179 --> 00:58:51,380
so. We don't have the green tile yet. We're going to do the other room. We don't have the green tile

470
00:58:51,380 --> 00:59:02,659
yet. Can you flip it by the way? This is a dog shit view. All right. Green tiles here. Wait,

471
00:59:02,659 --> 00:59:08,260
we got to do. We got to do shit. We have to shellac it. I'll get I got I got I got I got I got it.

472
00:59:10,579 --> 00:59:15,960
Toss it on. Oh, all right. Put it in. Who said that I didn't do anything this whole stream? I did

473
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:20,360
that right there. I'm done. I don't think anybody said that. I think you're just like projecting a

474
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:27,579
little. Why are you throwing it back at me? I don't need it. Well, maybe I will actually.

475
00:59:28,219 --> 00:59:36,699
I didn't realize that that's such a limited quantity. Oh, all right. Don't get out of here.

476
00:59:37,340 --> 00:59:52,650
Ice. Oh, okay. Wait. Whoops. I can go down here in a minute. All right. Then we did do that carpet.

477
00:59:52,650 --> 01:00:00,809
You're doing the tile up there. Good shit. I think I'm all tiled up. All right. I'm going to put this.

478
01:00:00,809 --> 01:00:09,289
We're going to go what corner out. That was just returning. Yeah, I wasn't sure if I missed those

479
01:00:09,289 --> 01:00:19,619
or not. But look at the power of teamwork, everybody. You just put aside your differences.

480
01:00:19,619 --> 01:00:27,349
Can you imagine that this would take 100% longer if it was just me in this room and not you here

481
01:00:27,349 --> 01:00:34,710
too? You think about that? Like I'm fucked up. That is I'm thinking about like why does it take

482
01:00:34,710 --> 01:00:39,909
two hours to put one table together when you pay people to do it? Do they not know the instructions

483
01:00:39,909 --> 01:00:52,539
ahead of time? Why does it cost like a hundred and fifty dollars? This is my favorite comment

484
01:00:52,539 --> 01:01:00,139
of the night so far. Oh, this is going too well now. Resident sleeper. Oh, no. Now they like,

485
01:01:00,139 --> 01:01:05,739
they get it. No. Wait, there's something missing here. One blue carpet and a little green wall

486
01:01:05,739 --> 01:01:19,880
is missing. One blue carpet. Yeah. Where? In between the trees. Oh, that's it. Any wet spots?

487
01:01:23,159 --> 01:01:33,800
It's going way too swell. Dude, we got to install wacky mods. Basically beat the game.

488
01:01:40,219 --> 01:01:46,059
Three stars. Oh, mega low clap. No, that was resident sleeper clap. I just pretended it.

489
01:01:46,219 --> 01:01:49,420
Look at how hard this one looks. Does the guy have clown outfit rooms?

490
01:01:50,219 --> 01:01:59,380
Okay. We've got new type of tile. I think we have to shellac shellac. So shellac this whole thing.

491
01:01:59,380 --> 01:02:05,159
It's only these. Honestly, you asked me to play this game with you and it feels like I agreed to

492
01:02:05,159 --> 01:02:11,960
chores and I didn't realize it. Yeah. But didn't you also play this or clean up detail? Oh, and

493
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:16,679
he, he hated it and he left the, he left, he abandoned the game and left the stream.

494
01:02:17,639 --> 01:02:22,840
Yes. So that did happen. Well, we played for a bit, but I mean, I mostly just dragged all

495
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:30,199
the dead bodies into one room. Refuses to do chores. Yep. Sounds like a professional streamer.

496
01:02:32,550 --> 01:02:39,590
Definitely a professional. What are these barrio blocks? These are locked. I don't understand. Why

497
01:02:39,590 --> 01:02:51,050
is this locked? It's like, it's a locked information block. I don't get it. Why do we have so many

498
01:02:52,010 --> 01:03:01,559
flower packs? What's the new thing? Why do you, why are you carrying around gasoline?

499
01:03:04,869 --> 01:03:09,590
We might have to mix this stuff. It might be glue because it looks like there's wallpaper.

500
01:03:10,550 --> 01:03:17,699
All right. Well, let's keep, what was this thing for trash? Do I think we have to like sift the

501
01:03:17,699 --> 01:03:25,050
flower in there? Let's find out. All right. It's supposed to, it tells you the instructions.

502
01:03:27,059 --> 01:03:32,260
It's shellac plus paint shellac plus carpet. Carpet. That's it. Yeah. I think we're over

503
01:03:32,260 --> 01:03:36,739
complicated. There has to be like a second step though, because we have like these big flower bags.

504
01:03:37,860 --> 01:03:42,099
No, I think there's just, this place is full of garbage. I think it's just trash. Yeah,

505
01:03:42,099 --> 01:03:45,860
it's just trash. All right. We do only have one bucket though, I think.

506
01:03:46,579 --> 01:03:54,780
Yes. Pick a spot up here and just, you're going to throw like a 30% full bucket away.

507
01:03:56,170 --> 01:04:01,849
Inefficient. Dude, I'm trying to use the bucket for the like paste. What we got,

508
01:04:01,849 --> 01:04:06,250
we're on one job in here. Finish this one first. But the trash can's like right there.

509
01:04:07,289 --> 01:04:28,039
Okay, just put it in. What, what is this? Hey. This is, Star sees how long it takes for us to

510
01:04:28,039 --> 01:04:34,039
notice that he stopped working in the, I think. Sorry, I took a drink like one time in an hour.

511
01:04:34,039 --> 01:04:39,800
Listen, you're only as good as you're weak as Link. Or so I've been told. I took, I took a drink.

512
01:04:40,519 --> 01:04:48,119
I took like a sip of soda. Get back to work, you fucker. I just want this to be as realistic

513
01:04:48,119 --> 01:04:52,599
as possible. That's not efficient use of your time. Listen, you only get one break a day. Get back in

514
01:04:52,599 --> 01:04:58,969
there and go to work. Yeah, you're lucky I'm not taking all the fucking doors off right now.

515
01:05:01,239 --> 01:05:08,949
I'll do it. Zip. Okay, so what do we actually need here? What are we doing? What's going on?

516
01:05:08,949 --> 01:05:16,760
We're both trying to do the same thing. All right, we got a minute 55 to do everything.

517
01:05:16,760 --> 01:05:20,599
And what do we have to do? We just have to, we have to paste all the floors.

518
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:29,420
All of them? All in the left. We got to paste them all? Start in the back. What the fuck?

519
01:05:29,980 --> 01:05:37,289
No, we don't. What? No, we just have to roll the carpet down. This is the only room we had to do.

520
01:05:38,090 --> 01:05:43,769
Which room do we have to paste? We have to do the hallway. We're at zero percent. You're saying

521
01:05:43,769 --> 01:05:49,530
we're done. Look, look, look, look. We have the hallway and then the storage room. The hallway,

522
01:05:49,530 --> 01:05:53,449
every single one of these walls needs to be done in a minute. You're going to do that? Yeah,

523
01:05:53,449 --> 01:05:56,650
you got a minute. Take another sip of your drink, you piece of shit.

524
01:05:56,650 --> 01:06:05,750
We're failing. Yeah, there's no way we're going to be able to do this. Well, we're at 20 percent

525
01:06:05,750 --> 01:06:12,789
now. We'll get one star on this one. So what is the shellac? That's okay. That's all we had to

526
01:06:12,789 --> 01:06:18,840
begin with. Why do we have shellac here? I think we're done with it. The wall in here needs to

527
01:06:18,840 --> 01:06:28,809
just be pink. Let's go. But we have to tear down the wallpaper. What do we have for percentage?

528
01:06:30,010 --> 01:06:40,869
45, 50. Where's the garbage? Down the bottom. It's just a shellac bucket right now.

529
01:06:40,869 --> 01:06:43,349
Well, I'll take care of that. Here, here, here, here, here. We don't need the shellac

530
01:06:43,349 --> 01:06:49,269
for anything anymore, right? Right. 20 seconds. Paint as many walls as you can.

531
01:06:51,639 --> 01:06:54,599
Why did they spawn this back in the same room that I was in with?

532
01:06:55,320 --> 01:07:05,849
Please just put this down. 10 seconds. We're almost done. Bottom left, bottom left, bottom left.

533
01:07:05,849 --> 01:07:12,179
I'm going to throw all the garbage in the neighbor's house. One, zero. Wait, what? How

534
01:07:12,179 --> 01:07:21,960
do we get one star? The hallway was at zero. How? Did we paint it wrong? Maybe it's because we

535
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:27,909
didn't finish. We'll do it again. Oh, I'm just going to start removing things. Yes, just throw,

536
01:07:27,909 --> 01:07:33,510
just start. That's first. Start getting rid of trash. All right, trash in the left room.

537
01:07:34,309 --> 01:07:39,349
I'm going to, I'm going to tear down these walls. Gorbachev, Gorbachev, Gorbachev.

538
01:07:40,309 --> 01:07:48,260
This carpet is here. Trash upper left. Carpet is here. Ain't that the truth? Why can't I just

539
01:07:48,260 --> 01:07:57,820
throw this into the street? Yeah, what button is it? All right, the peel has been peeled.

540
01:07:58,539 --> 01:08:11,559
Have you guys seen this otter? Do you want another drink, Rick? They gave us too many

541
01:08:11,559 --> 01:08:16,470
paints to confuse us. That's the problem. Yeah, they wanted to test your foreman skills.

542
01:08:16,470 --> 01:08:37,640
What if your color blind? Do we have all these? Okay, we're going in here now. Are you having

543
01:08:37,640 --> 01:08:43,689
fun in here in this bottom left room? How am I falling down? Stupid fucking Minecraft mystery

544
01:08:43,689 --> 01:08:50,250
block. Get the fuck out of here. Does Minecraft have mystery blocks now? It's been a while since

545
01:08:50,250 --> 01:09:05,989
I played. To clean this up. All right, all the trash has been removed from the house. Incorrect.

546
01:09:05,989 --> 01:09:11,510
We have the trash in this room on the floor. This fucking wrapping paper up here. Hold on,

547
01:09:11,510 --> 01:09:20,149
I'll get it. Oh my word. This whole hallway is full of trash. I'm going for it. I'm getting

548
01:09:20,149 --> 01:09:30,520
everything. Wow. It was 200 IQ to put all the trash in front of the recycling bin. Now I can't

549
01:09:30,520 --> 01:09:43,140
get to it. I can't get to the recycling. All I hear right now is milk me. Listen, you're not

550
01:09:43,140 --> 01:09:52,300
getting any of this paycheck. All right, so what do we need? Do we need pink carpet? I think we

551
01:09:52,300 --> 01:10:01,029
just did it wrong. Where's the blueprint? Give me that. With three minutes. Hallway needs to have

552
01:10:01,029 --> 01:10:05,590
pink walls, which is almost done. There's one thing missing somewhere. The storage room needs

553
01:10:05,590 --> 01:10:12,310
to be ground. It has to be orange, not pink. And these walls on the bottom left need to be like

554
01:10:12,310 --> 01:10:19,850
purple. Do we even have a, what color was it? Purple? No, just the ground. Yeah, that's it.

555
01:10:19,850 --> 01:10:30,760
Now we just, we have to just do the carpet on the, oh fuck my mouth. Don't do that. Which

556
01:10:30,760 --> 01:10:39,850
character are you? He's the one that just fell and broke his jaw on one of the counters. Which one

557
01:10:39,850 --> 01:10:59,270
am I? You scared the shit out of me. I'm sorry. There are five different paints. I wasn't even

558
01:10:59,270 --> 01:11:10,520
looking. That was so confusing. People in tabs are just like, wait, what just happened? Don't

559
01:11:10,520 --> 01:11:19,020
read chat. They don't have anything interesting to say anyways. There's two. All right. If this

560
01:11:19,020 --> 01:11:23,979
is a one star, we have to turn off this game. It's not going to be a one star. If we one star

561
01:11:23,979 --> 01:11:30,789
this one, this game, this game's getting turned off. If you're not watching at all, you just like,

562
01:11:30,789 --> 01:11:41,579
what, did he like bite down on a colonel? Can someone help this guy? And particularly could it

563
01:11:41,579 --> 01:12:03,449
not be me? We just, we just do orange carpet. Oops. Just fight over the carpet. See? Hey,

564
01:12:03,449 --> 01:12:17,449
we did it. This is a dirty ass house. Not anymore. It's not outside. There's something else. Uh,

565
01:12:17,449 --> 01:12:23,689
we're missing one thing. Uh, no, we're missing a couple of things. Is it the outfit on the wall?

566
01:12:24,569 --> 01:12:31,130
I'm going to rotate. Ah, fuck it. You're two of them. Yeah. I count as one.

567
01:12:31,850 --> 01:12:39,159
What's the other one? Um, is that wall supposed to look like that? I guess so. Two left. What is

568
01:12:39,159 --> 01:12:46,550
it? It's not on the wall. Shut the doors. I don't know. I don't know. Oh, I don't know.

569
01:12:46,550 --> 01:12:57,239
It's not too close to the front. Mop it up. I didn't see anything. Yeah. I didn't see anything

570
01:12:57,239 --> 01:13:06,229
either. It was, it had flushed the toilet. I think he had to plunge to the toilet. I mean,

571
01:13:06,229 --> 01:13:14,069
we all took a shit in there, right? All wait. All of us. Yeah. And that five minutes without,

572
01:13:15,850 --> 01:13:23,689
oh my God, we powered through. Is it an outhouse? Hey, okay. Okay. Pay attention.

573
01:13:24,489 --> 01:13:35,880
You have to paint a wall with glue and then wallpaper. All right. So shellac wallpaper done.

574
01:13:36,439 --> 01:13:45,510
Oh, now it's a different season. Uh, yeah, that's a ice mechanic. I was trying to throw you in,

575
01:13:45,510 --> 01:13:54,699
but it didn't work. You now slip. Do we have a bucket? All right. Clean up. Clean up. Clean up

576
01:13:54,699 --> 01:14:06,699
first. I have a question. Yes. Why would you want your house to be ice? Where like a cartoon land?

577
01:14:08,119 --> 01:14:23,060
Say that word again. Cartoon land. I'm done. I'm done. I don't want to hear it. Okay. So living

578
01:14:23,060 --> 01:14:28,979
rooms. I don't, there's too many things. I'm not the four minute. I can't think. My brain is dead.

579
01:14:33,500 --> 01:14:39,500
Just give me a task and I'll do it. All right. Give us both a task. Uh, we got carpet carpet.

580
01:14:39,500 --> 01:14:45,100
Where's purple carpet go? Purple carpet goes top right, top right. And the walls need to be done

581
01:14:45,100 --> 01:14:51,260
up with the currently existing in the same room, purple tubes. So top right is purple.

582
01:14:52,220 --> 01:14:57,960
The top right is purple. Top left also needs to be purple walls, but they need to be painted.

583
01:14:58,760 --> 01:15:12,069
So top right is not paint. I'll wait till you're ready. We also need green carpet at the bottom.

584
01:15:13,029 --> 01:15:26,630
I got it left. Purple paint on the walls. It hurts. I didn't know how long it was going to take. I knew

585
01:15:26,630 --> 01:15:37,859
it was going to, I didn't know how long it was going to take. Talking shit. You messed it up.

586
01:15:37,859 --> 01:15:49,300
I'm the floor is ice. I'm sorry. Green carpet. All right. Now we do this on the walls.

587
01:15:50,180 --> 01:15:57,369
So we need that bucket back up here. Okay. But can I like empty it first?

588
01:15:58,420 --> 01:16:11,220
Um, we already did. All right. Now we do the walls. Ooh, I like that. That's um,

589
01:16:11,220 --> 01:16:18,199
Oh God, it goes away. No, maybe that means it just dries. Yeah. So you have to like paste it and then

590
01:16:18,199 --> 01:16:23,319
put the, Oh shit. I got, I got you. I got you. I got you. You paint. Purple's down here. Purple's

591
01:16:23,319 --> 01:16:31,750
down here. I got it. All right. Bring the purple up here. I'm going to paint and you go. Hold on.

592
01:16:31,750 --> 01:16:37,510
I'm going to bring it closer. Oh no. No, that's no. Okay. I don't know why I thought you were

593
01:16:37,510 --> 01:16:41,829
going to paint over the whatever. All right. I got the top left room because you're dumb.

594
01:16:42,550 --> 01:16:45,109
I didn't know how long it was going to take. I don't know how long it was going to take,

595
01:16:45,109 --> 01:16:50,569
but you're fucking dumb. Got them. You're going to see a couple of E he's. It'll be fun.

596
01:16:53,909 --> 01:16:59,979
Wouldn't that be so funny if you did like a Keck. All right. This room is done. Get out of here.

597
01:17:01,300 --> 01:17:06,340
I'm looking too long. It was targeting the thing next to it, even though I was very clearly not

598
01:17:06,340 --> 01:17:14,420
looking at that thing. What a dope. Okay. Here you go. You ready? No, no, no. I got to get

599
01:17:14,420 --> 01:17:27,829
rid of this trash because you've spilled something. Don't mind me. Just sneak it in. Here we go.

600
01:17:28,630 --> 01:17:38,539
One more on this side. There's two more over here actually. Get it together. Do you guys remember

601
01:17:38,539 --> 01:17:46,569
the nineties? I'm pretty sure he still does that. Pretty sure he does too. He's still currently

602
01:17:46,569 --> 01:17:59,859
touring. That's it. That's it. We've got the ice didn't even matter. Be careful what you wish for.

603
01:18:01,850 --> 01:18:05,609
And five left. All right. What else? What else? What else? What else? What else? What else?

604
01:18:05,609 --> 01:18:14,630
I can't wait to wait to the lava mansion. The sexy magma girl, new animal. What is it? A llama?

605
01:18:19,449 --> 01:18:32,329
Sure. I want to be that. How do I switch characters like this? Oh, who's going to be,

606
01:18:32,329 --> 01:18:44,550
you're going to be the llama. All right. Be the dog. Now this is even weirder. Wait, which one am I?

607
01:18:45,189 --> 01:18:51,270
You're the otter. Oh, now this is a cartoon. You've been extolling the virtues of being the otter.

608
01:18:52,229 --> 01:18:59,960
All right. We did this. We can go up another level. Isn't it cool how like the otter gets

609
01:18:59,960 --> 01:19:06,220
bonus stats in the water levels? Wow. It's got an achievement for Game of Thrones. Yeah. I got that

610
01:19:06,220 --> 01:19:17,289
too. A song of ice and fire or something, right? Song of fire and snow. What's this one? I told you

611
01:19:17,289 --> 01:19:22,489
to be careful what you wish for. All right. I'm getting the couch. Quote, the ice didn't even

612
01:19:22,489 --> 01:19:30,699
matter. I would spin this because like this is a terrible angle. What's that noise? I can't,

613
01:19:30,699 --> 01:19:34,220
we can't get in there. It's messed up. We have to go all the way around. I think. No, we don't.

614
01:19:37,050 --> 01:19:49,579
Where am I? Which one am I? I actually got lost up there. Okay. Okay. Ready? I can't pick it up.

615
01:19:49,579 --> 01:19:57,909
There it is. Where does this even go? Outside? How do we? Hold on. Let me open the door.

616
01:19:59,270 --> 01:20:06,949
All right. Turn. It's ice. Oh, yeah. It is ice. Why? Why? There's three people.

617
01:20:07,670 --> 01:20:18,979
Just leave it in here. Just throw me. Throw me. I'll get it. Throw me. Throw me. I am pushing

618
01:20:18,979 --> 01:20:34,229
the throw button. Throw me. Oh, my God. Reset. Okay. Purple carpet. Oh, my God. You just told

619
01:20:34,229 --> 01:20:44,170
me to do that. He told him. I thought you could like read. You just said restart, restart, just

620
01:20:44,170 --> 01:20:50,170
do it. And I'm like, okay, why wouldn't we? Restart. Restart it slow. Restart it slow. Well,

621
01:20:50,170 --> 01:20:57,739
now I know you're being fucking dope. Facetious. All right. What's the first room we're doing?

622
01:20:59,720 --> 01:21:02,840
Okay. Fuck the couch. We don't. Seriously. It's wasting time.

623
01:21:06,119 --> 01:21:09,960
Restart. You didn't get a good enough job. Why can't you read sarcasm?

624
01:21:11,880 --> 01:21:19,529
Okay. I'm going to start in. What do we even need to do? We have to. The couch is the only

625
01:21:19,529 --> 01:21:23,289
thing to do right now, unless there's trash. Is there like a trash room? No, there's a

626
01:21:23,609 --> 01:21:26,970
trash bucket at the bottom, right? We need to take the wallpaper off in this room.

627
01:21:26,970 --> 01:21:41,479
How do like, I'm not even mentally present. All right. Trash it up. Oh, we have to move

628
01:21:41,479 --> 01:21:44,840
that couch because it's blocking the door where the deliveries come. All right. What are we doing

629
01:21:44,840 --> 01:21:56,020
with this? I'm going to dump this. It won't let me. I'm going to get any more trash I need to pull

630
01:21:56,020 --> 01:22:01,720
up. I don't think so. So bring that. We need to paste the walls. Leave it on the front porch.

631
01:22:02,359 --> 01:22:09,619
I'll get it later. Don't make me sign for concrete. Throw that glue over here. Which

632
01:22:09,619 --> 01:22:20,039
one of these rooms needs to be purple? Where's the blueprint? Okay. Purple is probably. Check

633
01:22:20,039 --> 01:22:29,930
blueprint. I got it. Purple's left. So this room has to be this room here. The bottom left is

634
01:22:29,930 --> 01:22:37,539
striped. Bottom left is striped and this is just paint. Dude, can you guys deliver it all at once

635
01:22:37,539 --> 01:22:43,220
next time? Or I'm going to, I don't, what am I doing? You're accepting deliveries. You're doing

636
01:22:43,220 --> 01:22:47,380
a great job. What do I do now that I've accepted the deliveries? Now what you're going to do is

637
01:22:47,380 --> 01:22:51,300
you're going to do, go to the, you're going to get the glue. You're going to fill a, this bucket

638
01:22:51,300 --> 01:22:55,539
next to me. All right. Get that paint bucket up at the top and then go to the bottom right room.

639
01:22:56,819 --> 01:23:03,060
Take that and fill that with glue. And then you're going to slack the bottom left and then shrink

640
01:23:03,060 --> 01:23:19,770
it and then don't come to work tomorrow. Honestly, that's all very doable. Are we done with the

641
01:23:19,770 --> 01:23:29,029
paint? I think we're done with the paint. Is this room supposed to be purple carpet? That's supposed

642
01:23:29,029 --> 01:23:38,789
to be green paint on the walls in the lower right. Lower left is shellac and where's the carpet go?

643
01:23:38,789 --> 01:23:44,710
Yes. You're correct with what you're describing. I'm going to, you didn't mix, you didn't even do it.

644
01:23:45,430 --> 01:23:49,829
I didn't, I didn't do it. There's a lot of cleaning up. There's ice. I had to get two deliveries.

645
01:23:50,630 --> 01:23:55,270
You just throw me under the bus after I had to walk uphill in the ice both ways to get to the

646
01:23:55,270 --> 01:24:00,310
front door. I actually did. I actually did though. Fucking goddamn fucking idiot. Fucking stupid.

647
01:24:00,310 --> 01:24:12,699
Fucking goddamn. All right. You ready? I didn't do this job before, so I don't.

648
01:24:17,029 --> 01:24:26,060
Oh, this burst is too big. No, it's just trashed. I'm wearing one of those tacky

649
01:24:26,060 --> 01:24:36,409
tourist outfits for Halloween. Okay, shellac. It looks like an inflatable. I'll clean this up.

650
01:24:38,739 --> 01:24:44,020
All right. Okay. Can you help me paste the walls and I will put the wallpaper over the paste?

651
01:24:46,260 --> 01:24:51,960
I don't have anything I can do, so I'm just going to clean. Star, you've made a real mess about

652
01:24:51,960 --> 01:24:59,319
time. Pick up the paste. No, I need that. Okay. Sure. This room is so tiny and shitty.

653
01:25:01,939 --> 01:25:06,979
All right. How about you can't target the things you want to do. Can somebody come?

654
01:25:08,340 --> 01:25:12,340
Star, where are you going with that? Shut up. You're supposed to be pasting. I'm cleaning.

655
01:25:12,340 --> 01:25:20,039
I'm cleaning this fucking room. Hey, you don't just put it in another spot. I'm ready.

656
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:27,720
Okay. You need me to paint. Yeah, I need you to do the paste. What do you think you're doing

657
01:25:27,720 --> 01:25:45,500
down there? We're going to have to get a saline IV going in you. My brain doesn't work this late

658
01:25:45,500 --> 01:25:49,739
in the day. This is like two more. I should have been bed an hour. Hey, hey, hey. What? There's

659
01:25:49,739 --> 01:25:56,539
two more? This is not trash? Yep. What are you doing? I need that spit in your mouth like you

660
01:25:56,539 --> 01:26:01,340
want me to do to you. Hey, can you come back and paste these? Where are you going? Why are you

661
01:26:01,340 --> 01:26:08,140
running in a circle with a blueprint? I was getting it out and I was avoiding something in front of

662
01:26:08,140 --> 01:26:19,180
you. Okay. Top two only. All right. Ready? 23 seconds. Get out of the way. Get out of the room.

663
01:26:19,180 --> 01:26:29,260
Just get out of the room. You're just messing it all up. Go. Clean it. Okay. I got it.

664
01:26:40,340 --> 01:26:49,109
I swear you were an obstacle for that level. There was a moving block that was just getting

665
01:26:49,109 --> 01:27:11,350
in the way. 2.9 stars. That's fine. I tried my best. We haven't done this one. No. That was a

666
01:27:11,350 --> 01:27:17,510
big one. That was a big one. That was a big one. This game needs a scoreboard. You know, I don't

667
01:27:17,510 --> 01:27:29,159
like the snow levels. If that's supposed to be me, you're doing a very good job. Oh, wait. This is

668
01:27:29,159 --> 01:27:36,899
a three-parter. Okay. We got purple carpets, strike purple walls, and then we need special

669
01:27:36,899 --> 01:27:47,899
blue walls. Yeah. Wallpaper. I'll take that. Thank you. What do we have to do? I'll take care

670
01:27:47,899 --> 01:27:53,659
of this. You guys wait for another delivery. Just hang out and talk. I need that puke bucket.

671
01:28:00,729 --> 01:28:11,449
What do I have to talk to italics about? Yeah, right. Star Wars or something. Don't knock that

672
01:28:11,449 --> 01:28:15,130
over. Don't knock that over. Don't dare. He probably likes the last Jedi, so it's okay.

673
01:28:16,010 --> 01:28:22,569
I do not. Oh, boy. Oh, there you go. Oh, boy. Name a game that I like that came out like the last

674
01:28:22,569 --> 01:28:32,789
five years. Name a game. Dwarf game. Dwarf game? Yeah. Dwarf Miner shooting game. That game was

675
01:28:32,789 --> 01:28:46,199
okay. He did it. Yeah, you like that. I'm going to get that delivery, please. Minecraft. Did Minecraft

676
01:28:46,199 --> 01:28:54,199
come out in the last five years? Yeah, I think so. Like 1.0. We got to get glue going in the top

677
01:28:54,199 --> 01:29:02,840
left. Not before we have all the trash removed up here. That's not trash. Don't dare come in here

678
01:29:02,840 --> 01:29:09,960
and start doing things. Is this not the purple carpet room? No, it is. Sorry. I really flew up

679
01:29:09,960 --> 01:29:14,279
the handle there. Sorry about that. I just threw it in the garbage. All right. Now we can put paste

680
01:29:14,279 --> 01:29:25,510
in here. Okay, we need to paste the top left room and we need to paste the bottom left room

681
01:29:25,510 --> 01:29:30,710
different colors. That's like all we have, I think. Is there anything else to do? Let's check.

682
01:29:31,590 --> 01:29:38,090
Carpet. There's only going to be one paste, so we can only do one room at a time. Yeah. Yep.

683
01:29:39,130 --> 01:29:44,090
So one person is non-essential. So I'm just going to, you know, I'll not be the obstacle this time.

684
01:29:44,090 --> 01:29:50,739
I just don't want to get yelled at. All right, we'll do this room first. I mean, you could just

685
01:29:50,819 --> 01:29:55,720
put the paste in your mouth and just spit it into the wall and then do it. It wouldn't be too hard.

686
01:29:55,720 --> 01:30:00,840
All right, let's start in the big corner. You know what? If you guys need to rotate, call in

687
01:30:00,840 --> 01:30:05,399
the AC 130. Listen, this paste holds the wallpaper in place. If you put it in your mouth, maybe it'll

688
01:30:05,399 --> 01:30:23,050
hold your lips in place. Alex, what are you doing? Are you happy with anyone?

689
01:30:23,930 --> 01:30:33,060
I'm just sitting out there. You're sitting out there like the newspaper rolled up.

690
01:30:33,699 --> 01:30:36,979
How do you live with him? You're trying to, you're trying to like,

691
01:30:38,489 --> 01:30:48,520
wait, uh-oh, there's a little hoopsie over here. Wait, where are you going? I have to throw this

692
01:30:48,520 --> 01:30:57,449
away because we have to use that bucket of paste and AFK player is just outside. I explained that

693
01:30:57,449 --> 01:31:02,489
there is nothing for me to do. You know what? I did read that this game doesn't scale based on how

694
01:31:02,489 --> 01:31:07,289
many people you're playing with, so it's not any easier or harder. There, I gave you something to

695
01:31:07,289 --> 01:31:22,229
do. Okay, thank you. Which wall are we on? Thank you for any of them. What just happened?

696
01:31:25,369 --> 01:31:34,979
Why is this trash now? What? Uh, I think you put the, I don't know. It must've gotten empty.

697
01:31:34,979 --> 01:31:40,819
We got two men. Okay, we got playing time. Oh my God. You haven't even done this one room yet.

698
01:31:44,579 --> 01:31:54,380
So paste. Let's go. There you go. Now put it on the wall. Don't look at me. Nice work.

699
01:31:55,100 --> 01:32:07,939
We have just got to stuff in the corner and that's it for this one, right? You need to glue this

700
01:32:07,939 --> 01:32:14,470
entire room down here with that. Okay. And then that's it. Well, how about you do that? There's

701
01:32:14,470 --> 01:32:21,590
the glue. And I'll tidy up. I mean, I just want you, I want you to participate. So I'll fill it

702
01:32:21,670 --> 01:32:32,090
up for you. Ready? See? There we go. Now I'm going to move over here and I'm going to be ready.

703
01:32:32,090 --> 01:32:46,779
Wait, I'm, hold on. I'm working overtime here. Sorry. I took your job there. Uh, can we get a

704
01:32:46,779 --> 01:32:54,310
rotate champ? What is that? Hey, champ, can you give us a rotate? He wants you to go pick up the

705
01:32:54,310 --> 01:33:02,140
thing and move the thing, pick up the thing and move it. Oh, turn the camera. Thanks champ. You

706
01:33:02,140 --> 01:33:13,529
guys need it again. Let me know. I think we're going to need it again here in a second, champ.

707
01:33:15,449 --> 01:33:22,140
What are you doing? All right. Let's tidy up. All right. Everybody back it up. That's a day's work

708
01:33:22,939 --> 01:33:28,659
all in a day's work. You fucking guys are so bad at this game. Like I'm missing dinner now.

709
01:33:29,460 --> 01:33:40,119
How do you still have that from so long ago? That's so, you know what? I hope in a hundred

710
01:33:40,119 --> 01:33:46,840
years, somebody digs up your XLR or whatever it is and plays that. It'll, it'll be on there.

711
01:33:48,279 --> 01:33:55,189
Oh, we're not good enough. We need three more stars. Well, we can go back to floor one. Yes.

712
01:33:55,189 --> 01:33:59,350
We were terrible. That's true. We could get, we did miss at least two plus stars.

713
01:34:01,829 --> 01:34:10,979
Oh, these are, these are going to be the real baby hours. 10,000 years from now. That's the

714
01:34:10,979 --> 01:34:16,899
only evidence of humanity. Don't alt tab is what I've learned. Why? Cause it like, if you're doing

715
01:34:16,899 --> 01:34:21,619
this broadcast thing, it like freezes your feet. Oh yeah. This is, look at how dog shit this is.

716
01:34:22,100 --> 01:34:29,300
One star. This is my bedtime. Did you know that? What? For third, five 30. It's five. Yeah.

717
01:34:29,859 --> 01:34:36,819
On the West coast, but over here, it's six 30. It's so no, hold on. No, it's five 30 there.

718
01:34:36,819 --> 01:34:39,859
All right. What do we have to do? Guys, we're supposed to get three stars. I'm looking at

719
01:34:39,859 --> 01:34:46,899
the clock. It's, it's actually six 30 here. Oh yeah. It's, it's weird. It's still very early.

720
01:34:47,859 --> 01:34:55,770
What time do you wake up? Like noon. You go to bed at six 30. You wake up at noon.

721
01:34:58,010 --> 01:35:04,779
He's got six good hours a day. I was, I was going to say that's like left to yellow, not orange,

722
01:35:05,500 --> 01:35:12,520
orange bottom. Looks like kicked it. All right. We start pulling stuff up. I'll get the trash.

723
01:35:13,319 --> 01:35:20,890
I'll get this door. Grab that back to this. Back is the question. How did we manage to one star this

724
01:35:21,529 --> 01:35:26,090
because this is still, this is one star. Didn't know how to X what's going on here.

725
01:35:26,970 --> 01:35:43,909
Someone get the door, please. All right. We got this here. Any more trash, all the stuff on the

726
01:35:43,909 --> 01:35:51,859
floor. Can I have that? Okay. Put it right in the door. Nice. How did we manage to one star this

727
01:35:51,859 --> 01:36:11,689
Mr. Disruption? All right. Yeah. You just do it. It'll be easier. I think close the door. It'll

728
01:36:11,689 --> 01:36:19,260
probably help. No, it's the door. Yeah. I'll just apparently we got paint. We got paint. Get the

729
01:36:19,260 --> 01:36:30,020
paint. We got paint. Go get the paint. Let me go. Oh, this is not. Oh, you gotta be fucking kidding

730
01:36:30,020 --> 01:36:44,380
me. Just trade you. Okay. All right. We got orange paint here. We need, we need that trash bucket

731
01:36:44,380 --> 01:36:49,899
again. We need the trash bucket. I'll get it. I'll get it. I'll get it. Oh, you get it. You're going

732
01:36:49,899 --> 01:37:01,579
down there already. You're closest. Doss it over here. I wonder how we didn't do this for the last

733
01:37:01,579 --> 01:37:09,350
time. There's two minutes, but you calm down. I didn't say anything. I just replayed that part of

734
01:37:09,350 --> 01:37:15,270
the screen. You fucking guys are so bad at this game. He didn't get a go XLR sponsor. So he just

735
01:37:15,270 --> 01:37:23,880
has to do it for like by his memory. Have you even used that in its board's intended purpose?

736
01:37:24,840 --> 01:37:30,039
What is its intended purpose? I thought it was for you to that wasn't what the joke was that you

737
01:37:30,039 --> 01:37:36,460
play that while you were like mad at Overwatch. Oh, well, no. Back in the day, I was using it to

738
01:37:36,460 --> 01:37:40,939
record other people who were mad at Overwatch. Right. So I gave you a I'm mad at Overwatch clip

739
01:37:40,939 --> 01:37:48,810
and you haven't used it. I did use it during that was like a long time ago. We don't get three stars.

740
01:37:48,890 --> 01:38:03,770
Okay. Can you peel this? Thank you. Now on your way out, just scoop that up on your way out.

741
01:38:03,770 --> 01:38:08,229
Scoop. Did you not shut the door? Thank you. What are we missing?

742
01:38:11,130 --> 01:38:26,699
What are we missing? We only have 42 seconds. We have 40 seconds. What? Are we stupid? The kitchen.

743
01:38:28,100 --> 01:38:39,800
The kitchen wall? I don't see anywhere. Did we paint the wrong room? No. Tiny wall.

744
01:38:41,930 --> 01:38:45,050
Can we get that paint that we're not going to get three stars. Where's the tiny wall?

745
01:38:48,939 --> 01:39:02,649
Oh, I see it. Oh, I see it too. Oh, wow. Okay. Good.

746
01:39:09,449 --> 01:39:16,090
It's two minutes. We got plenty of time. Yeah. We missed one, one fourth of a wall.

747
01:39:29,260 --> 01:39:39,640
Quickly now. We got this. We learned nothing. Yeah. I know. I hope so. Well, at least no one can say

748
01:39:39,640 --> 01:39:53,880
this is going well anymore. You know, that doesn't help very much because I have to set it down.

749
01:39:54,840 --> 01:40:04,619
Shut up. I just now I'm looking at you with a shocked. Whoa. What the heck? I just threw a

750
01:40:04,619 --> 01:40:10,789
bucket. It's like into like through a roof for you. That doesn't help very much. It's like,

751
01:40:11,909 --> 01:40:21,720
where's the awe? What do you mean? Oh, like, isn't like, oh, oh, why would there be an awe?

752
01:40:22,439 --> 01:40:29,079
No, like shock and awe, not like, oh, oh, I thought you meant like, I threw that bucket in for you.

753
01:40:29,079 --> 01:40:42,649
Oh, you did that for me? No. Well, thanks anyways, though. Shock and awe. Well, you spelled something

754
01:40:42,649 --> 01:40:56,220
over here. I did that. No, I. What button is it? Oh, I got it. Well, she's a real jack.

755
01:40:57,270 --> 01:41:01,670
All right. We got plenty of time now. Seriously, like you didn't even paint this one wall.

756
01:41:02,229 --> 01:41:09,079
Come on. This is where this is where we start making mistakes. No, you got the paint. I'm

757
01:41:09,079 --> 01:41:17,720
going to get this trash. I'm bringing the mango ice cream. You may want to get the bucket that's

758
01:41:17,720 --> 01:41:22,600
outside because I'm just. Well, it's all right. It's all right. You guys just can handle that.

759
01:41:22,600 --> 01:41:35,140
I can handle it. All right. We get we got the small wall right off the bat. But good, good,

760
01:41:35,140 --> 01:41:45,539
good. I hope I never see this level again. I hope I do. In fact, we might because there's still

761
01:41:45,539 --> 01:41:50,100
another wall. Let me help you. Ninety five. I got it. I got it. I got it. Stop.

762
01:41:50,100 --> 01:41:59,850
Stop. If we're just trying to go and do something and then the whole world rotates.

763
01:42:01,340 --> 01:42:13,319
What's left? Would you guys leave up here? When did you leave this three left? Hold on. Wait,

764
01:42:13,319 --> 01:42:17,079
hang on. It's well, there's only one thing left. Let me rotate the whole world.

765
01:42:17,960 --> 01:42:24,840
Rotate the world. Rotate the world. Please don't do this to me. How does this keep happening?

766
01:42:24,920 --> 01:42:34,340
Where is it? Trash outside. Does that count? Does it? It does. It does count. The trash on the

767
01:42:34,899 --> 01:42:40,359
porch. All right. Do we have enough with thirty two? We need one more star.

768
01:42:42,180 --> 01:42:48,340
We need a single. Yes, just one. Let's do level one. Level one. Level one.

769
01:42:49,989 --> 01:42:59,130
This game's got a lot of replay ability. All right. I bet you could do this by yourself.

770
01:43:02,260 --> 01:43:08,869
That's it. It just needs a pink wall. I think you know how much you've grown

771
01:43:11,590 --> 01:43:14,470
in just a short amount of time. We didn't. We couldn't figure this out in

772
01:43:15,270 --> 01:43:18,630
more than three foldments. It doesn't tell you the buttons.

773
01:43:20,199 --> 01:43:30,069
How many furries does it take to paint a wall? As many as you want. One could do it probably in

774
01:43:30,630 --> 01:43:38,939
a week if you skidded it kind of casually. What I want to know is how we finished it but

775
01:43:38,939 --> 01:43:48,899
didn't get three stars. I see. That's how I think that might answer your question.

776
01:43:51,770 --> 01:44:03,750
How much spill is there? It's a never ending spill. How did that? I pressed A to drop it

777
01:44:03,750 --> 01:44:14,500
and it spilled. All right. We can continue and do the progression into the elevator.

778
01:44:14,500 --> 01:44:22,010
We're about to unlock a new character, guys. What is it? I want to be an F-16 jet.

779
01:44:27,180 --> 01:44:38,149
Oh. One too high. How could we all be facing the wrong direction? All right. We go this way. Wait.

780
01:44:38,869 --> 01:44:51,609
To the left and then up. Oh. Unlocking number 13. Uh oh. Uh oh.

781
01:44:54,300 --> 01:45:01,369
This is a real hotel. There wouldn't even be a number 13. What the hell are we supposed to do here?

782
01:45:02,729 --> 01:45:10,729
I'm finding that info out. We are supposed to be... Oh, it's a mixy match. Yeah, it's a... And

783
01:45:10,729 --> 01:45:16,739
there's slits and there's couches. Good thing we have plenty of time. Is there even a bucket?

784
01:45:17,619 --> 01:45:26,579
Where's a bucket? We have nothing. There's no bucket. Oh, there's that bucket. Pretty brushes

785
01:45:26,579 --> 01:45:34,180
to the door. Is it for me? Does it have my name on it? Okay, you joke but that's real life.

786
01:45:35,140 --> 01:45:43,670
Which package is the opt? I have experienced that here in this house. Yeah, we just have to

787
01:45:44,630 --> 01:45:58,310
peel off the stuff one by one. What a great treat, you know, for holidays to just do

788
01:45:59,270 --> 01:46:04,100
repetitive tasks with your friends. That's what Christmas is all about.

789
01:46:05,460 --> 01:46:08,020
Some of my favorite games are games where I just have to like paint a house.

790
01:46:08,979 --> 01:46:19,449
Unironically, House Flipper is one of my favorite video games. You just like suck up bugs and

791
01:46:19,449 --> 01:46:29,779
vacuum cleaners and stuff. You just clean up a house and shit. Viscer cleanup detail. That's

792
01:46:29,779 --> 01:46:36,939
one of my favorite games. You just clean a house. I'm seeing a pattern. So would you say like the

793
01:46:36,939 --> 01:46:42,789
big game companies are trying too hard and they just need to make like house cleaners? And that's

794
01:46:42,869 --> 01:46:48,470
the next genre. Like it was like Minecraft, like Survival, Battle Royale, Cleaner. Yes.

795
01:46:49,189 --> 01:46:53,270
Is next. Yes. I don't know. Are they trying too hard or are they not trying hard enough?

796
01:46:55,189 --> 01:46:58,229
If there was like a hundred million dollar budget House Flipper type game,

797
01:46:59,109 --> 01:47:05,850
I would, that's all I would do. And it's like an MMO and you get to flip your houses to other

798
01:47:05,850 --> 01:47:11,369
gamers and then they get to live in the house. All right, are you painting the right walls here?

799
01:47:12,010 --> 01:47:16,489
I painted one wall and it was the right wall. I'm just going to keep this up.

800
01:47:18,409 --> 01:47:25,850
No, because then we can't. No, it just alternates. So how hard is it to alternate? I don't know.

801
01:47:25,850 --> 01:47:55,380
Somebody, what about the walls we can't see? Listen, if our eyes are real. Okay. Okay. Got it.

802
01:47:55,380 --> 01:48:00,500
Okay. Okay. Mirrors be real. I'm going to do a rotate. Is everyone ready for a rotate?

803
01:48:01,300 --> 01:48:11,850
25 seconds. All right. Go. Somebody didn't kill this paint off. How are we ever going to get

804
01:48:12,729 --> 01:48:18,649
you say someone didn't kill this paint off, which is like just an accusatory way. Like none of us

805
01:48:18,649 --> 01:48:22,970
did it. It could have been someone didn't. It could have been me. Yeah. That's all right.

806
01:48:22,970 --> 01:48:28,090
What do we do? Someone didn't get the door. No one. Do we do? You're trying to put the blame on

807
01:48:28,090 --> 01:48:32,729
one or purple purple. Yeah. I'm trying to put the blame on one person. It could have been me.

808
01:48:32,729 --> 01:48:38,649
I'm that one person that could have been me. That's no, that sounds like backtracking from

809
01:48:38,649 --> 01:48:42,489
your PR department. No, no, that's some somebody didn't do this. We need to rotate.

810
01:48:43,449 --> 01:48:54,010
I'm going to start cleaning up. Is there anything to clean up? You see one more purple wall, right?

811
01:48:56,279 --> 01:49:04,300
Is that account for like, well, we're not even done. Our progress is not good. Are you sure?

812
01:49:04,300 --> 01:49:09,020
I knew it was reversed. You were so sure though. I was. What do you mean reverse?

813
01:49:09,180 --> 01:49:24,579
Yeah, these are wrong. I was so sure. What? But yeah, yeah, I fucked us. Oh, I fucked us all.

814
01:49:24,579 --> 01:49:31,289
It's almost as if having the blueprint. One of us made a mistake here. One of us. Somebody

815
01:49:31,289 --> 01:49:39,609
did something wrong. Not sure who it was, but one of us. Somebody made a mistake. I think then this

816
01:49:39,770 --> 01:49:51,380
I think then this wall is also wrong. 94. I'll spit it. Got to be purple. Purple on the empty

817
01:49:51,380 --> 01:49:56,340
spot on the left. If anybody wants to move, you could do it. No, I'll get it. It's fine.

818
01:49:56,340 --> 01:50:16,659
Oh, you got it. Get those paint cans. One, two. Yeah. Three stars. Listen, if we got personal

819
01:50:16,659 --> 01:50:26,409
scores, mine would be highest. That's I don't mean that's a koala. Hey, that last one on the

820
01:50:26,409 --> 01:50:35,079
end. Is that exoskeleton buglionian boy? I want to be the outline. You can't just have the new one

821
01:50:35,079 --> 01:50:43,100
every single time. Yes, I can. All right. Let's just make it confusing. We'll all be koalas. No,

822
01:50:43,100 --> 01:50:51,590
no, no, no, no, no. All koalas the same color. Star. I know. As I said, my body type is an otter.

823
01:50:51,590 --> 01:50:58,310
I can't be the one you are. Oh, you can't be the same one. Oh yeah. I can be any other one though.

824
01:51:00,170 --> 01:51:14,310
You're just confusing people. All right. I'll be the dog again. Fine. I'll be this one.

825
01:51:14,949 --> 01:51:26,020
I'll look at the vanity here. We need 37 to go up that floor, by the way. Of course.

826
01:51:26,819 --> 01:51:35,079
Oh, there's a door open. Oh, there is? Oh yeah, there is. Number 14. We need 37 stars to reach

827
01:51:35,079 --> 01:51:40,979
this floor. Why does it keep? Oh, that's to go up to the next one. Correct. Yes.

828
01:51:41,779 --> 01:51:53,930
All right. Cool. What we got? Oh, this is a really nice island. Did you know that koalas

829
01:51:53,930 --> 01:51:58,569
are really close to extinction? We don't have blueprint. Yeah, I was actually told this.

830
01:51:59,909 --> 01:52:06,550
Maybe if they all just got jobs helping people move into their new homes like this koala.

831
01:52:08,020 --> 01:52:14,420
What? Just start taking taking off the wallpaper because it's going to ask us to. Yeah. Oh no,

832
01:52:14,420 --> 01:52:18,180
actually from what I was told and I did a little research myself, koalas have smooth brains

833
01:52:18,979 --> 01:52:24,100
and they will not eat food if it's on a table. They don't get it. It's not like on the tree.

834
01:52:24,100 --> 01:52:28,739
So they don't they will literally starve to death if you feed them their koala food on a table.

835
01:52:31,560 --> 01:52:36,920
And apparently they like have they just have sex with each other so much that they just I'm

836
01:52:36,920 --> 01:52:44,500
no this is not even a joke. Like there's so many like koala STDs. Did you learn any of those

837
01:52:44,500 --> 01:52:51,100
meerkat facts? Why is this going outside? I don't know. I just felt like the appropriate place to

838
01:52:51,100 --> 01:52:57,659
put it. I was just following your lead. All right. So what's the plan? Where is the plan?

839
01:52:58,619 --> 01:53:02,619
The plan's in the dumpster. It looks like the plan's in the dumpster. I don't think we have a

840
01:53:02,619 --> 01:53:08,140
plan. I think we might be waiting for a delivery either that or we just need to like trial and

841
01:53:08,140 --> 01:53:14,220
error and that would be really fun. Oh boy. Okay. Well, do we have an info? Yeah. I'm going to

842
01:53:14,220 --> 01:53:18,859
imagine that we glue these to this wall. I'm just going to, I'm going to, well, it looks like, yeah,

843
01:53:18,859 --> 01:53:22,939
that's what the game wants you to do. We actually probably need to glue them to the top left wall.

844
01:53:23,659 --> 01:53:26,460
I think that's the only thing we have, but what about the purple paint?

845
01:53:28,729 --> 01:53:37,100
All right. Try top left. I'm going to try purple paint here. Oh, is it carpet? All right. Purple

846
01:53:37,100 --> 01:53:52,840
top left. Okay. Let's give it a try. Progress is zero. I got progress for this. You got progress

847
01:53:52,840 --> 01:53:58,199
for that. This is probably bottom left. Yeah, this is definitely bottom left. All right. So what

848
01:53:58,199 --> 01:54:02,920
would be top left? The green? The carpet? No, where's the carpet go? We probably don't have

849
01:54:02,920 --> 01:54:19,460
the ingredient yet. There it is. Yeah, that's top left. Let's try that. Hey, it worked. Look at us

850
01:54:19,460 --> 01:54:28,310
solving this difficult puzzle. It is a puzzle. Now, if only they put like another

851
01:54:28,310 --> 01:54:37,590
couple million into the budget of this game. I'm not kidding. If there was a game where you did

852
01:54:37,590 --> 01:54:42,789
this, but it was not just like a fun little co-op game. No, no, no. Like you had to build a whole

853
01:54:42,789 --> 01:54:50,380
house. How much was this game? $20. Okay. Only one of us had to buy it. That's true.

854
01:54:51,100 --> 01:55:03,340
Okay. Considering that this is like $7 per person. Honestly, this game has... Oh no, I can't say that.

855
01:55:03,899 --> 01:55:10,680
Never mind. Are you getting progress by doing that? Have you checked? Yeah. Okay. Good. Okay.

856
01:55:10,680 --> 01:55:15,560
Just checking. Good. Good. Good. Good. Very good. I'm going to start trashing the walls over here.

857
01:55:17,380 --> 01:55:33,460
I'm going to start throwing up. Why? Missing a wall in the top left room. We probably should spin it

858
01:55:33,460 --> 01:55:42,409
to be honest. Honestly, you want to be really honest? Let's just... We can't spin it. Oh no,

859
01:55:42,409 --> 01:55:46,890
we can't spin it because there's no blueprint. There is no blueprint. Oh shit. Okay. So we have

860
01:55:46,890 --> 01:55:55,000
to... Get some pace. Do we have all the trash from this bottom left room? Oh, these bottom walls.

861
01:55:58,920 --> 01:56:02,119
Also, don't koalas eat eucalyptus leaves, which is like poisonous.

862
01:56:03,579 --> 01:56:10,520
Are you still on the koalas? No, no. Yeah. That's their main source of food is eucalyptus.

863
01:56:10,600 --> 01:56:15,640
It's poison. But over years and decades, their stomachs have been able to digest it.

864
01:56:16,439 --> 01:56:25,859
So we're doing... What? We need to do this bottom left room with the teal paper. Glue.

865
01:56:26,979 --> 01:56:35,529
Hey, thank you Utopia Fox. Utopia Fox. Utopia Fox. For the five community subs. Thank you.

866
01:56:35,529 --> 01:56:44,439
Utopia Fox. Thank you. You guys, are we getting progress on that? Yeah. All right. I'm going to

867
01:56:44,439 --> 01:56:48,199
start cleaning. Are we getting progress on that? We have a room in the top left. We need the purple

868
01:56:48,199 --> 01:57:02,100
wallpaper to be up there. Oops. I skipped one. This music sounds like Civilization 5 music.

869
01:57:03,060 --> 01:57:08,739
Koalas can't eat eucalyptus at birth because they lack the proper enzymes.

870
01:57:08,739 --> 01:57:11,859
They have to obtain the enzymes by eating their mother's poop.

871
01:57:13,300 --> 01:57:20,180
Oh. What if they're like... What if they don't have a mother?

872
01:57:24,359 --> 01:57:27,720
That's them. They were immaculately conceived and we might have missed

873
01:57:27,720 --> 01:57:31,079
Jesus Koala at some point. No. No. There was a lab involved.

874
01:57:32,279 --> 01:57:38,840
What are you doing? Thank you, Utopia Fox. Go get the fucking paper. I'm talking. All right.

875
01:57:38,840 --> 01:57:44,039
Okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I have a koala. Standing in the middle of the floor, not helping anyone.

876
01:57:44,600 --> 01:57:51,880
What do koalas make for a noise? 27 seconds left, might I add, looking up Koala facts in his chat.

877
01:57:51,880 --> 01:57:56,680
I think all you've done is move the thing further away. What do they do? Start cleaning up.

878
01:57:56,680 --> 01:57:58,359
Oh, sorry. There's a wall missing.

879
01:57:59,319 --> 01:58:03,079
Jera must just stand in the middle of the floor and I'm getting called out for helping you.

880
01:58:03,079 --> 01:58:10,250
I don't know who is who. You all changed. Can I eat this? Oh, we do have four seconds left.

881
01:58:10,250 --> 01:58:17,560
I'm sorry. Oh, yeah. Four seconds left. Oh my God. Now I can't. This guy. He went to college.

882
01:58:18,439 --> 01:58:24,279
You keep bringing that up. Hey, not all of us are in the top 1% of the educated

883
01:58:24,279 --> 01:58:34,600
elite that go to college for this shit. Oh, you're going to talk down to me now.

884
01:58:35,560 --> 01:58:45,270
Hey, quiet, quiet. Did you say college boy? Yeah, college boy. Hey, college boy.

885
01:58:46,069 --> 01:58:50,920
Are you my father on our weekly Sunday phone call when I was in college? Being considered a college

886
01:58:50,920 --> 01:59:00,260
boy is a step up from being a boomer like usual. These walls need to come off. That door needs to

887
01:59:00,260 --> 01:59:08,229
be answered. We have a blueprint this time. Which one are you now, Jerma? Are you the other? You're

888
01:59:08,229 --> 01:59:16,060
the koala. I'm the koala. I've been the dog for like four missions. OK, that's supposed to mean

889
01:59:16,060 --> 01:59:20,539
something to me. What do we do with the bag of flour? What do we do with a locked bag of flour?

890
01:59:20,539 --> 01:59:25,100
There's a lot of locked ingredients. I've heard you're supposed to drink it and don't come into

891
01:59:25,100 --> 01:59:39,140
work tomorrow. Oh, I have heard that too. Someone very wise said that. OK, this is our ingredient

892
01:59:39,140 --> 01:59:46,420
room. Top left is that carpet that you just put down. Top left is that carpet. Which one?

893
01:59:46,420 --> 01:59:52,579
Fuchsia? That one. That one. You got it. You got it. I'm doing it. You guys take care of that shit.

894
01:59:52,579 --> 01:59:54,739
Do we have any more trash that needs to be peeled off walls?

895
01:59:56,020 --> 02:00:07,300
I don't think so. Do we have a mix yet? There's a bag of that mix stuff in that right room.

896
02:00:09,960 --> 02:00:21,210
Now, whatever that's for, I don't know. Oh, what's the box? Did I do this wrong?

897
02:00:21,930 --> 02:00:24,409
What's this box? I don't know. I just have an indicator over here.

898
02:00:27,319 --> 02:00:35,140
Take this box to the rightmost room. Hold on. You want this box over there? Yeah, that little...

899
02:00:37,699 --> 02:00:41,539
Just you get it. It's right there. Can you knock it out now?

900
02:00:42,500 --> 02:00:48,420
Hold on. I just got to put that... Oh, these are like the wall tiles. OK, I get it.

901
02:00:49,060 --> 02:00:52,739
Here you go. We have to do the same thing, though. It dries. I need a second person.

902
02:00:53,619 --> 02:00:56,100
I'm almost done here. Then I'll be in there with you, Chief.

903
02:00:56,979 --> 02:01:01,220
I'm going to paint this top left room. You guys take care of that. Sounds good to me.

904
02:01:02,680 --> 02:01:09,979
I'm with you, Chief. What do you need me to do? Just pick up the box stuff and then put it on the...

905
02:01:14,340 --> 02:01:24,279
Oh, yeah. OK, Chief. It's one word catchphrase stuff.

906
02:01:29,029 --> 02:01:36,979
Whoops. That was not... The top left room is done. I don't think we need this fuchsia paint anymore,

907
02:01:36,979 --> 02:01:44,060
do we? I don't think so. I'm going to give you... You guys need to turn? Oh, yeah.

908
02:01:46,569 --> 02:01:51,670
Yeah, that's it. After that, you guys are done after that. Then I'm just going to start cleaning

909
02:01:51,670 --> 02:01:59,079
up. That's a three star. What do I have? I think I have tiles. You do have tiles.

910
02:02:08,550 --> 02:02:12,310
There we go. He makes it up at the end. There's just some construction puke over here.

911
02:02:17,180 --> 02:02:27,590
There's that one bundle. You want to put it on that final wall. Oh, oh. Oh, shit, dude. Oh, shit.

912
02:02:50,100 --> 02:02:55,699
Jesus. Am I watching a college drinking compilation where somebody chugs real fast?

913
02:02:55,699 --> 02:03:00,180
What are you doing? Get out here. Get outside. There's a minute. Put me down.

914
02:03:00,180 --> 02:03:11,960
Just recording our royalty free party on beyond sound effects. You good? What if you say college,

915
02:03:11,960 --> 02:03:26,619
boy? You guys have to finish that wall. I'm getting to it, dad. There's still one more thing. So

916
02:03:26,619 --> 02:03:32,600
could we get some rotations? It's this door. No. You need rotations? Oh, there's another wall.

917
02:03:32,600 --> 02:03:53,460
Right here. Right here. Right here. On me. There it is. Just you two? Yeah. Damn. Pretty

918
02:03:53,460 --> 02:03:59,779
good. Nice work, guys. We need 37. Hey, good job. We don't even get paid for this.

919
02:04:03,260 --> 02:04:15,750
How many floors are there? Well, the achievement was 999. 199. No, 999. This game is a testament

920
02:04:15,750 --> 02:04:21,109
that a couple of, you know, a couple of farm boys can work with one city slicker.

921
02:04:22,550 --> 02:04:26,310
You know what I'm talking about? We had trouble saying that for some reason. Why? Now we can

922
02:04:26,310 --> 02:04:31,270
work together with the social elite. I think it's actually the opposite because I went to college.

923
02:04:32,439 --> 02:04:38,199
So it's two college boys trying to teach one farm boy how to actually do things. We can't get this

924
02:04:38,199 --> 02:04:44,949
out of this room. Free education. We have to move it around. Does the queen live here?

925
02:04:45,670 --> 02:04:50,340
Where are you trying to move this? Just out of the way so we can start to do this.

926
02:04:50,899 --> 02:04:55,699
It's in the way now. It's in the way. It is in the way now. I'll just restart.

927
02:05:01,189 --> 02:05:06,149
We have. Yeah, this is going to be a pain in the ass. Just rotate it so we can walk by.

928
02:05:07,510 --> 02:05:14,149
There. Diagonally. Diagonal. Diagonal. Stop going through the door. You're pushing.

929
02:05:15,989 --> 02:05:20,310
All right. Let it leave there. Wow. Look at those two college boys work together on that one.

930
02:05:21,819 --> 02:05:28,340
That's this floor up here. So that's it's already been shellacked.

931
02:05:29,060 --> 02:05:43,939
There's no shellac. So just do it. Just click their heads. We need some couch movement I think

932
02:05:43,939 --> 02:05:52,789
here in a minute. If anyone touches this couch, I'm screaming. There's one behind the top right

933
02:05:52,789 --> 02:05:58,279
and the top left. If you touch this couch. Oh my god. Someone get the fucking door.

934
02:06:00,250 --> 02:06:03,130
You have to scream twice as loud because we've both touched different ones.

935
02:06:06,789 --> 02:06:10,630
Yeah, good metallic. Seriously, that's like a that's like a we like looked over and like

936
02:06:10,710 --> 02:06:14,310
wink. You know what I mean? I want to hear the scream. That was a that we need to double scream

937
02:06:14,310 --> 02:06:23,590
now. Boy, that was very bad. That was very bad. That was very bad. I'm sorry. It's my bedtime.

938
02:06:26,010 --> 02:06:30,090
He can't scream because everybody in that city goes to sleep at six p.m. That wasn't even a

939
02:06:30,090 --> 02:06:35,289
scream. That was like I just I just swallowed a whole wall. Can we get a blueprint boy out there?

940
02:06:35,289 --> 02:06:42,979
Carpet right here. Oh, hold on. Doesn't that mean that all these are hidden?

941
02:06:42,979 --> 02:06:52,359
Yeah, we need to be. This needs to be spun with the blueprint in my god. Oh my god.

942
02:06:54,380 --> 02:07:04,460
He's joking. Somebody help him. All right. That room's all done. Now, this is for this room then

943
02:07:05,100 --> 02:07:13,270
the tiles. Are they for the here? No one knows. No one knows. Yep. Tile that room. Wow. Get it

944
02:07:13,270 --> 02:07:22,149
going. That's a lot of time. Um how do we thank you. That's a lot of time. We have to do. We have

945
02:07:22,149 --> 02:07:34,279
to move all this stuff. Just do all these ones that are not inefficiency. Just do the ones that

946
02:07:34,279 --> 02:07:39,159
are already empty that you don't have to move the table twice over. Now, you gotta move the table

947
02:07:39,159 --> 02:07:50,760
again. Please don't worry. Don't worry about him. K.O. legacy. Thanks for the ten community subs.

948
02:07:51,640 --> 02:08:01,340
Thank you for the ten subs. A huge drop here. Thank you. Ten fucking subs. Thanks a lot.

949
02:08:03,300 --> 02:08:07,539
Uh something's on fire. That sounded like thanks a lot but I mean I mean like thanks a lot like

950
02:08:07,539 --> 02:08:17,899
seriously. I'm sorry. I'm currently being yelled at so sorry. What? This thing's not supposed to

951
02:08:17,899 --> 02:08:25,100
be up here. Okay. I'm just holding this up in the air while you guys do the tiles underneath it.

952
02:08:27,420 --> 02:08:31,340
All the lactic acid is built up but I'm gonna like have to scream here in a second.

953
02:08:35,989 --> 02:08:42,899
Okay. Now, we gotta move the table again after we get this. We gotta get this tile down. I'm going

954
02:08:42,899 --> 02:08:50,729
for it. Always with the tile on this guy. Did you intentionally lock us back here?

955
02:08:51,979 --> 02:09:02,279
We're missing tile for the bottom left room that needs to be done with. We don't have the

956
02:09:02,279 --> 02:09:07,560
tile for it. There's tile in the top right room or something. What is it? Yeah, we need that tile

957
02:09:07,560 --> 02:09:14,260
in there. Alright, chief. This you need this tile in there with that tile over here. Alright,

958
02:09:14,260 --> 02:09:18,260
I'm gonna start clearing out. I'm gonna start clearing shit up. Okay. We don't need anymore.

959
02:09:19,479 --> 02:09:27,029
Alright, chief. I can't wait till you progress. There's a large bed in here. To like buddy or

960
02:09:27,109 --> 02:09:33,500
like guy or something. Alright, guy. Alright, buddy. What? Did you not hear? You keep just

961
02:09:33,500 --> 02:09:40,310
changing words. You didn't hear the news? Alright, pull the bed. There's no genders anymore. There's

962
02:09:40,310 --> 02:09:50,329
only sports. Okay, but pull the bed in such a way that I can get in there. Just place it on this

963
02:09:50,329 --> 02:10:01,699
front one even though it's gonna block you. I'm trying. I'm gonna crush him. We're actually about

964
02:10:01,699 --> 02:10:11,420
to throw it over the edge. Alright, there we go. Good. Let me out. I feel like I am playing

965
02:10:11,420 --> 02:10:15,899
Minecraft again. I went A and K and when I came back, somebody boxed me in with no tools.

966
02:10:15,899 --> 02:10:26,090
We have to put tiles down in the room. Just lean the bed up into the ceiling. This is ultra lazy.

967
02:10:26,970 --> 02:10:31,369
You don't want to take the bed apart to clear the room. Alright, we got 50 seconds

968
02:10:31,369 --> 02:10:39,189
and we're missing something. What are we missing? Kitchen. It might be that. Okay, it didn't drop.

969
02:10:40,619 --> 02:10:44,380
Okay, we gotta start cleaning up. Oh my, he's getting it. Make room for the bed.

970
02:10:48,069 --> 02:10:52,310
Can you just come out? Free bed. Free bed. Free bed. Are you seriously not gonna want a free bed?

971
02:10:52,949 --> 02:11:05,829
Open that door right now. Are we stealing from them? That's just perpetuating, you know.

972
02:11:05,829 --> 02:11:12,869
That's true. That is stealing. You said we weren't getting paid. That's a fee.

973
02:11:13,930 --> 02:11:17,289
That moving people are just animal people like otters.

974
02:11:17,930 --> 02:11:22,649
Now what do we need? This one is large, but I think it's fake large.

975
02:11:23,449 --> 02:11:27,899
Alright, I think two people could do this one. You know what I mean? Fake large,

976
02:11:27,899 --> 02:11:40,279
kind of like when I puff out my stomach to look fatter. Yeah. Or just sit normally.

977
02:11:45,989 --> 02:11:54,539
Alright, what's the goal? Hold on, I don't think he processed it. It's alright. I'm muted right now.

978
02:11:54,539 --> 02:12:01,770
I don't think he processed that. Tear down these walls. Okay, I gotta compose myself because I

979
02:12:01,770 --> 02:12:12,199
can't laugh at that. Anyone want to do something? I don't know what the, what are we supposed to

980
02:12:12,199 --> 02:12:17,239
restart? Tear down these walls. That was really mean. Okay, that's not what I was trying to say.

981
02:12:17,239 --> 02:12:24,380
Answer the door. Answer the door. Alright, I got pizza. What is this? I think we, I think,

982
02:12:24,380 --> 02:12:31,319
okay, next game. I think we're done. You do, hey, you do know what the next game is, right?

983
02:12:32,600 --> 02:12:36,760
The next game is like this game, but different. The next game is like this except it's a train

984
02:12:36,760 --> 02:12:48,069
instead of a house. Look, you guys are doing nothing. I know. Wait, wait. No,

985
02:12:48,069 --> 02:12:53,699
I'm not done. I'm not done. Who's done here? Hold on. Who's done here? I was done an hour ago.

986
02:12:53,699 --> 02:12:59,939
No. Alright. It was my bedtime an hour ago. We started an hour ago. You done? Two hours ago.

987
02:12:59,939 --> 02:13:13,510
I'm not done. Taleks, you done? No. Alright, majority rules. You have to stay. Okay. Alright,

988
02:13:13,590 --> 02:13:18,069
these are my, this is my swing vote though. If there's not a new mechanic by the next floor,

989
02:13:18,069 --> 02:13:30,140
I'm done. Okay. Well, the mechanic, this floor is moving furniture. Oh no, we have,

990
02:13:30,140 --> 02:13:34,939
but we got a backup thing. Okay, start tearing down these walls. Okay, tear down the walls.

991
02:13:35,579 --> 02:13:52,600
Get the garbage can that you already put shit in. Oh, it's empty. There. Okay. The train one

992
02:13:52,600 --> 02:13:57,640
actually, yeah, the train game does look pretty fun. Hey, you guys don't even know what the train

993
02:13:57,640 --> 02:14:09,539
game is. Do you? I do. I linked it to you. When we want justice, when do we want it now?

994
02:14:12,090 --> 02:14:18,250
Another backup plan. Okay, so we need to put these tiles on this wall. Everything turned off.

995
02:14:19,369 --> 02:14:27,850
I, we need, um, different type of wall thing. Is it not here? Where's this carpet go?

996
02:14:28,649 --> 02:14:33,689
I don't think carpet. I don't think the carpet goes anywhere. It goes in the kitchen.

997
02:14:34,250 --> 02:14:42,520
This shit goes in the kitchen. What? No, wait. Oh wait. Yeah, it does. I got it. I got it. I got

998
02:14:42,520 --> 02:14:47,800
it. I got it. Which one's the kitchen floorboard? It's got like a floorboard. Look, is it here?

999
02:14:47,800 --> 02:14:54,199
Is this a kitchen bringing things? Which is what's the kitchen? So many things. All right.

1000
02:14:55,159 --> 02:15:02,520
Um, I don't know. I think this is a kitchen. Yeah. Wait, that's floorboard. What's this?

1001
02:15:03,399 --> 02:15:10,779
Yeah, that's not that carpet. Doesn't go there. That's the thing you're carrying

1002
02:15:10,779 --> 02:15:16,779
goes in the room. It goes in. Are you sure that's not it? Oh no, that way. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1003
02:15:16,779 --> 02:15:21,340
It goes in here. No, it's not. It's wrong. We haven't made any progress. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1004
02:15:22,220 --> 02:15:24,779
Kitchen carpet is right, but the percentage didn't go up.

1005
02:15:25,979 --> 02:15:38,100
Is this right? That's definitely right though. The percentage isn't going up at all. Maybe it's

1006
02:15:38,100 --> 02:15:47,560
because we smell. Uh, did we not tear something off? I mean, that's exactly the way it's supposed

1007
02:15:47,560 --> 02:15:55,029
to look. We didn't shellac. Uh, maybe there's so many things to do that my feeble wall painting

1008
02:15:55,029 --> 02:16:03,189
is not. Yeah, but the individual thing on here would show progress, but it doesn't. This one's

1009
02:16:03,189 --> 02:16:10,789
done blueprint. Are they different? This one's done. I know. Okay. Wait, no, we're going, I guess.

1010
02:16:10,789 --> 02:16:14,390
Oh, they're high. There's one high, one low. There's two different blueprints.

1011
02:16:15,750 --> 02:16:18,710
There's two different blueprints and one of them's false.

1012
02:16:19,510 --> 02:16:27,979
Oh, yeah. Fake blueprints. No, we got fucking tricked. So there is a rival company actively

1013
02:16:27,979 --> 02:16:32,860
trying to sabotage us. What the fuck? Well, that's a new mechanic, but I don't know if I,

1014
02:16:32,940 --> 02:16:37,979
I don't know if I like it. I don't know if I like it. It's just a time waster. You just restart

1015
02:16:37,979 --> 02:16:43,540
at that point and then you play the train gamer. You're like, go to bed. Right. It was frame game

1016
02:16:43,540 --> 02:16:56,649
time. Where's the latte wallpaper was like the latte wallpaper. Do we have latte wallpaper?

1017
02:16:59,000 --> 02:17:15,850
Holy shit, dude. That was, that was violent. What do you, it just sat watching him just keep slipping

1018
02:17:15,850 --> 02:17:25,020
in the back corner. He's just making a mess to try to get us to do the train game.

1019
02:17:25,020 --> 02:17:33,139
He wants to leave. All right. Train game. He wants to. All right. Fine. Fine. This was called

1020
02:17:33,139 --> 02:17:41,479
tools up. So we're going to do train game and I'm going to go to VRB screen and I'm going to go pee

1021
02:17:42,120 --> 02:17:47,639
and then we'll open it up. Just. Oh my God. He pees once every two hours. Not sure. I didn't

1022
02:17:47,639 --> 02:17:52,540
pee for eight hours last night. Last literally last room. I didn't go back in months. All right.

1023
02:17:52,540 --> 02:17:58,819
The first night you haven't wet the bed in the last month, mutable. I don't know. All right. I'm

1024
02:17:58,819 --> 02:18:02,899
going to go pee. What do you mean you don't have train game in you, dude? It's dinner time.

1025
02:18:05,000 --> 02:18:14,299
Why do you guys got to start so late? It's not even late. It was three. It was like four or five

1026
02:18:14,299 --> 02:18:20,860
o'clock. That's late. Then you have to do time zones and then consider what time it is in Europe.

1027
02:18:20,860 --> 02:18:26,870
Do you sleep apnea? No, I've just been waking up really early. No, he just, he just wants to go

1028
02:18:26,870 --> 02:18:35,780
to bed at six thirty seven o'clock at night. That's what it is. Do you go to get the early bird

1029
02:18:35,780 --> 02:18:45,430
special at your local diner too with all the other old people? I wish. All right. I'm going to go pee

1030
02:18:46,069 --> 02:18:50,950
at star. If you're, if you're still with us, then you're still with us. If not have a wonderful

1031
02:18:50,950 --> 02:18:55,670
early word judgment coming from early bird scrambled eggs. It's just going to be a full

1032
02:18:55,670 --> 02:18:58,389
plate of scrambled eggs. You're not going to order anything else. And then you're just going to be

1033
02:18:58,389 --> 02:19:02,309
like, this is what I like. And everyone is going to be like, what the fuck? Why are you doing this?

1034
02:19:03,110 --> 02:19:14,010
You're being really mean right now. Really uncomfortable. All right. All right. Are you

1035
02:19:14,010 --> 02:19:19,209
staying or are you gone? I'm going to look at the game again. I'm going to look at it. All right.

1036
02:19:19,209 --> 02:19:23,129
I'm going to go pee. I'll be right back in two minutes. I have zero brain power at this point in

1037
02:19:23,129 --> 02:19:32,680
the day. Non-canon week. Is this going to be another game where I have to like think?
