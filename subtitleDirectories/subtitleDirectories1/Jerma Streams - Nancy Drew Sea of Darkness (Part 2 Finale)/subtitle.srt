1
00:00:01,399 --> 00:00:30,010
Dude, I think, uh, I think my computer's dying. Can you get it? Hold on, can you hear this? Do you hear that? It's going like

2
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:38,649
What the fuck is that?

3
00:00:38,649 --> 00:00:43,320
Let me turn up the gain so you can hear it

4
00:00:43,719 --> 00:00:47,479
This is freaking me out. All right. I'm gonna make no noise to make sure you can hear this

5
00:00:48,439 --> 00:01:05,689
Do you hear that? No, not the fucking car driving by

6
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:11,959
I have to be careful because of

7
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:14,439
a ill-timed room

8
00:01:15,719 --> 00:01:20,040
Will be horrible if I turn this. Um, I don't know. Anyways, my computer's making a weird noise

9
00:01:20,439 --> 00:01:22,599
Uh, who cares? We'll just run it into the ground

10
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:25,900
Uh, hello guys. How you doing?

11
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:29,750
Hope you all having a good day

12
00:01:29,829 --> 00:01:33,430
Hope you had a good holiday those of you that celebrated christmas. Hope you had a good christmas

13
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:36,150
Any other holiday that you happen to celebrate?

14
00:01:37,209 --> 00:01:39,510
Uh, mine was good

15
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:41,510
Uh, I spent the last few days

16
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:47,689
Besides christmas, obviously the last two days in a row have been doing something very important

17
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:50,730
And if we could get a link, please

18
00:01:51,609 --> 00:01:56,170
For the new year's eve stream 2019 nominations

19
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,340
The voting is live

20
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:07,530
Go vote survey monkey.com slash r slash germa nye 2019. There are there were

21
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:11,050
A lot of nominees

22
00:02:11,449 --> 00:02:13,449
There are a lot of categories

23
00:02:16,169 --> 00:02:17,210
they

24
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:18,729
Let's just put it this way

25
00:02:18,729 --> 00:02:20,729
um worst noise of the year

26
00:02:21,289 --> 00:02:27,530
I believe after combing through and removing some stuff that might should not have been there potentially and putting them all in

27
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:30,009
I think there were 24 nominees

28
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:36,099
And now I think there's like 20 or something. It's a lot. There's a lot

29
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,099
I couldn't remove them though

30
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:42,659
So many of them, I I can't remove them

31
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:53,180
But uh, they're available there's source clips for you to check it out source streams for you to see what the potential worst streams of the year was

32
00:02:53,819 --> 00:02:55,819
That stream is going to be on new year's eve

33
00:02:56,629 --> 00:02:58,550
so december 31st

34
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:00,789
Uh, we'll do pretty much the same thing. We did last year

35
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:06,629
With the only difference being I might not be in the studio this year because it might I don't think I can get the time

36
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:10,069
But I will be in my best suit

37
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:15,789
And we'll just comb our hair and i'm going to be in a tuxedo

38
00:03:16,669 --> 00:03:20,830
Instead of at the studio, it's just going to be me in a tuxedo sitting in my fucking office

39
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:31,240
No budget this year. No budget on uh on the new year's eve stream this year, uh accidentally spent it all

40
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:34,039
Uh on the previous streams this year

41
00:03:36,939 --> 00:03:39,629
small budget cut

42
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:47,210
Small budget cuts here and there but uh today

43
00:03:48,409 --> 00:03:50,409
Um, let me tweet this out first

44
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:52,919
Today I was gonna play no more heroes today

45
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,400
For the wee i'm gonna play them both

46
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:59,240
I remember playing them a long time ago. I was gonna do no more heroes

47
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,599
but

48
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:02,569
I do I

49
00:04:02,569 --> 00:04:04,569
I don't know. I can't get my wiimote

50
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:07,419
to connect

51
00:04:07,419 --> 00:04:11,419
To my computer through bluetooth. I it won't do it. I don't know why

52
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:15,580
I've been sitting here for the last 20 30 minutes trying to get it to work

53
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:21,920
And I mean, yes, I am using an emulator. That's what i'm doing

54
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,160
Uh, I own no more heroes

55
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:29,129
I I

56
00:04:29,129 --> 00:04:31,290
Not illegal not illegal. I own this shit

57
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,920
All right. The last time I talked about, you know, I like to use original hardware

58
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,160
There was a wave of like you fucking idiot just emulate it. What are you stupid?

59
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:49,579
And now that i'm trying to emulate it, what are you in a thief? I'm illegal get the fuck out of here

60
00:04:49,579 --> 00:04:54,540
Put them in jail

61
00:04:54,540 --> 00:05:01,689
Uh, I I did play on wii u on original hardware, but here's the thing about no more heroes

62
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:04,170
Uh, like I said, I own

63
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:06,250
You've seen me play on the wii u before

64
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:10,250
I own all this stuff. I own no more heroes the cd

65
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:12,410
Here's the problem

66
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:14,569
that game looks so

67
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:17,370
Fucking awful and plays

68
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:20,889
So awfully on the original hardware

69
00:05:21,709 --> 00:05:22,990
It's you

70
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:25,629
No, I refuse to stream it on original hardware

71
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,939
That game runs at like 16 fps at 480p

72
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:35,870
It really does

73
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:38,189
And they did remake they'd made a ps3 version

74
00:05:38,189 --> 00:05:39,949
But here's the problem

75
00:05:39,949 --> 00:05:45,600
They didn't remake the second one. No more heroes 2 is only on the wii

76
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:48,480
I don't know. Why didn't they not do them both?

77
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:59,720
So what what would end up happening is I would go from oh look at the ps3 version. It's like hd and looks good

78
00:06:00,439 --> 00:06:02,439
Okay. Now let's go to no more heroes 2

79
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:06,459
And it's uh, it's it's like 480p and runs at 12 fps

80
00:06:09,129 --> 00:06:13,050
Play it who cares about quality. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, it's that game's hard

81
00:06:13,689 --> 00:06:17,689
Do you understand how angry I would get if I played that on original wii?

82
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:21,439
I would be so angry

83
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:27,439
I would die like 15 times to the same boss because like the fps dropped to like 22 and i'd be like, where's the fps?

84
00:06:31,769 --> 00:06:38,730
so, uh, i'm gonna get that set up i'm gonna try to figure out i'm gonna get a new dongle or something for my wii mode because

85
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:40,649
um

86
00:06:40,649 --> 00:06:47,680
I just I don't understand like this. This is this is this wii mode is not broken or anything

87
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:58,430
Shouldn't be like it's a wiimote. It's like hey look, it's a wiimote

88
00:06:59,149 --> 00:07:01,149
I'm trying to connect to your computer

89
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:04,569
I don't understand

90
00:07:04,569 --> 00:07:12,970
He's naked. Did you replace the batteries? Yeah, this is brand new batteries in here

91
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:17,319
I think it's my computer. My computer's bluetooth just sucks

92
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,920
I figured it was just gonna work. But what a unit. Hey, thanks

93
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:31,720
If you ever want to play gta casino, hit me up. I'll invite you to my arcade. You can play on my machines. That sounds fun

94
00:07:33,449 --> 00:07:35,449
Easy flexing sometimes

95
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,000
So instead of just scrambling what here's here's what was gonna happen

96
00:07:41,209 --> 00:07:43,209
I was going to drive

97
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:45,529
to

98
00:07:45,529 --> 00:07:47,769
Just go get a bluetooth dongle

99
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:56,199
But I it's like four o'clock. I'm not doing that right now. I'm just gonna what it's gonna do drew crew

100
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:59,180
We'll do it again tomorrow. I'll try it again tomorrow

101
00:08:00,189 --> 00:08:02,430
And if look if for some reason I can't get it to work

102
00:08:02,829 --> 00:08:07,149
Then we're just gonna play the original one anyways or the ps3 one i'll figure it out by tomorrow

103
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,120
So let's get drew crew on here

104
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,709
Uh, this is where we left off

105
00:08:15,709 --> 00:08:19,550
I don't know what any of these really mean. Let me just make sure I say drew crew

106
00:08:20,269 --> 00:08:26,009
So people know what i'm streaming

107
00:08:26,009 --> 00:08:28,889
But all right, those of you computer, uh friends in here

108
00:08:30,189 --> 00:08:32,299
Let me ask you this

109
00:08:32,299 --> 00:08:33,820
Why would

110
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,820
So when I open up my bluetooth

111
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:37,980
And it's like

112
00:08:38,299 --> 00:08:40,299
Looking for bluetooth devices

113
00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:47,480
Why does it find a wireless speaker set from like six houses down the road, but it won't find my

114
00:08:48,679 --> 00:08:53,159
Wiimote I don't understand

115
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,559
Is there something wrong?

116
00:08:58,559 --> 00:09:00,879
Use the red button. Yeah, the the sync button

117
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:03,759
It's because bluetooth sucks

118
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,500
Wiimotes aren't bluetooth. Yeah, they are

119
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:12,990
Dude, the wii is like 20 years old. I yeah, but still

120
00:09:14,169 --> 00:09:16,169
It's bluetooth device

121
00:09:19,019 --> 00:09:21,580
Dude the wii is 20 years old

122
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:32,679
All right, I need to like I need to start streaming i'm actually kind of glad that we're doing drew crew tonight because

123
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,960

124
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:42,269
Bringing in editors to put videos and start like it's it's been like a kind of a two-day process here

125
00:09:42,269 --> 00:09:45,169
So i'm glad we can just the wiimote is infrared

126
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:51,490
Yeah, there's an infrared camera on it, but the device is bluetooth. It's actually a bluetooth. You don't think I know my computer technology

127
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:56,740
Now let me just tweet that

128
00:09:56,740 --> 00:10:03,120
Okay. What do you mean the wiimote is bluetooth?

129
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
It's a different bluetooth version

130
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:12,240
All right. Well, do I need to get like a special wheat like a what like a bluetooth 2 or something dongle?

Just get a wii. I

132
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:23,970

Jerma, why are you playing on original hardware? Just get an emulator. Jerma get an emulator

134

That's all good. I got it. I got it. I got it

143

Past when I was young. All right, let me try to give a as best as I can

144

All right, so I crashed uh, I crashed into the harbor and we're trying to figure out who crashed the boat into the harbor

147
00:11:33,139 --> 00:11:35,139

Good thing they have this that's done. Got that one. Can't check that still have can't check. Yeah

150
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:54,769
Oh, yeah, that's right. Dagny ran away because dagny was responsible for all this shit

151
00:11:55,649 --> 00:11:59,299
Man, let's take oh, that was a cell phone. It was a cell phone

152
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:03,080
Did we know what the password is yet? Did we figure this out?

153
00:12:07,139 --> 00:12:10,500
When did this game come out?

154
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,039
uh

155
00:12:12,039 --> 00:12:14,039
I have no idea

156
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:20,610
2013

157
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:24,710
Password is puffed

Where would I get this info from? Yeah, she she knocked this over this way. There's a blood trail all the blood

00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:39,970
These footprints they're huge

160
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:44,850
Only one guy in town has feet this size. All right, it's the guy with the beard

161
00:12:44,929 --> 00:12:46,929
Go find the guy with the beard and say hey this footprints

00:12:47,889 --> 00:12:49,889
Give me the password to her phone

163
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:56,039
All right. I'm gonna give you something strange that it's happening in my brain right now. This is very strange

164
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,330
I

165
00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:02,610
Have I feel like I haven't left from last time

166
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:08,960
Like this i'm still streaming from the last time I streamed this

167
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:16,019
This is not a second stream. This is the same stream. That's weird

168
00:13:16,659 --> 00:13:18,899
All right. I know what today

169
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:22,659
Do you know where uh dagny is? Do you know where dagny is the mink?

170
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:30,659
Missing I found a footprint near dagny's heater. It looked an awful lot like one of yours. What more?

171
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:36,019
I have nothing to do with it. Why would I take the mink? Where would I go?

172
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:39,620
My only home is here in the pub. I'll let you go

173
00:13:41,139 --> 00:13:43,460
That didn't help at all. All right, so I have tiny key

174
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:55,250
All right, the souvenir is right. I have like I have toys and shit in here hook. I still want to figure out what to do with the hook

175
00:13:59,509 --> 00:14:03,509
No, he no, he doesn't know. No, no, not at all. I like absolute zero

176
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:06,629
hold on like

177
00:14:06,629 --> 00:14:10,309
I need to uh pull up the walkthrough for a second. I know drew crew. Don't worry

178
00:14:11,269 --> 00:14:13,029
right now like

179
00:14:13,029 --> 00:14:19,299
200 people's mouths just dropped. I'm not cheating. I'm just trying to find where we left off

180
00:14:20,019 --> 00:14:22,019
I'm not this is not cheating

181
00:14:22,019 --> 00:14:24,179
This is just finding where we left off

182
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,720
All right. Let me just go down to where we were

183
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:36,820
This looks pretty accurate

184
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:41,779
All right. Yeah, the guy the guy came out with a knife, right? He came out and he was like, oh and he tried to stab him

185
00:14:42,419 --> 00:14:44,980
And then he walked away. That's what we left off. That's like the last thing that happened, right?

186
00:14:45,539 --> 00:14:48,279
Okay

187
00:14:48,279 --> 00:14:49,879
All right. Now we have to go

188
00:14:49,879 --> 00:14:54,600
Uh, I gotta go to the crow's nest because I remember that he was like go to the crow's nest and I was like, okay

189
00:14:55,559 --> 00:14:59,970
All right. Where's where's that cultural center?

190
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,350
Put on lipstick

191
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:07,990
No, I i'm not gonna say anything about anything

192
00:15:09,009 --> 00:15:12,370
Here's the thing. I know I saw this in the pre-stream chat and it was actually kind of funny

193
00:15:13,169 --> 00:15:15,570
Yeah guys, i'm not making any jokes until 2020

194
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:19,830
I'm not saying a thing

195
00:15:20,389 --> 00:15:25,990
Because there's no more nominations. So this is just wasted effort for me to make a joke. Why would I do that?

196
00:15:27,669 --> 00:15:35,879
It can't be used in this year. It can't be used next year either. I should just not turn my stream on until december 31st

197
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:44,070
That book mentioned this this is this is not canon. Maybe there's something here again not canon

198
00:15:50,049 --> 00:15:55,490
We're in joke purgatory. Okay. Well, I just got this similar to that note. I found in magnus's journal

199
00:15:56,519 --> 00:16:01,639
I can't I can't make it because if I say something if something happens, okay, let's just say

200
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:04,610
That like nancy drew

201
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:09,889
I don't know like drives down the road and like hits me with the car and I fall in the water or something

202
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:13,090
And like I climb out of the water and I talk about like a bulk of water joke

203
00:16:13,169 --> 00:16:16,850
I don't know and then like people go. Holy shit. That was ridiculous. It's the most ridiculous moment of the whole year

204
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:22,149
It's like well, that's too bad

205
00:16:22,149 --> 00:16:25,320
It's not gonna come up next year

206
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:28,120
All right. I need the history book

207
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:33,799
The crow's nest which stands in the center of the skip rot today adorned the original ship at one point

208
00:16:37,639 --> 00:16:44,440
But was carted off to serve as a watchtower dubbed old stolka. It had remained on display in off limits to tourists for over 100 years

209
00:16:45,159 --> 00:16:48,120
This is it solution is to divide into groups of six

210
00:16:48,919 --> 00:16:50,919
No group touching another

211
00:16:52,759 --> 00:16:54,759
divide into groups of six

212
00:16:54,919 --> 00:16:58,500
What are you talking about groups of six?

213
00:16:59,809 --> 00:17:03,379
Oh like that

214
00:17:03,379 --> 00:17:05,859
Like that. Okay, so that's group six. That's a group of six

215
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:09,220
Somebody just said I just want to say fuck the drew crew

216
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,519
uh

217
00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:15,190
I

218
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:17,190
I don't know what to say about that

219
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:20,000
because

220
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,720
They've taken over. There's nothing. There's not much I can say

221
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:35,170
Group six, right?

222
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:38,099
shit

223
00:17:38,099 --> 00:17:41,650
Done got it. Wait, where's the last one?

224
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,200
This is a drew. This is a drew crew stream rise up

225
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,880
Wait, what is this groups of six?

226
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:59,680
How do I not have that?

227
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,859
Make one look on the right

228
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:04,950
12345612345

229
00:18:08,119 --> 00:18:10,119
123456

230
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:13,779
Divide the board into groups of six with no group touching another

231
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:19,599
123123123123123123

232
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,829
What I get wrong

233
00:18:23,829 --> 00:18:29,200
You're missing one. I need to

234
00:18:31,269 --> 00:18:37,349
Oh, I get it. Okay. Hold on. I have to so these can't be moved. Oh, I get you. I get you watch this drew crew

235
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:43,690
Can we get some i'm gonna get a fucking new emote called druze germa druze

236
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:51,519
Why am I like pandering right now? Like I played this I played nancy dru like twice on stream

237
00:18:52,819 --> 00:18:58,180
What's the point of me pandering to you know, like this is like only the third time you've ever seen i've streamed

238
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:02,980
Like sakiro more times in this game and I don't have a sakiro emote. What the fuck am I talking about?

239
00:19:06,259 --> 00:19:09,380
I streamed like red dead redemption 2 like seven times

240
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:16,289
All right, here we go. He's pandering panda to the crew

241
00:19:17,089 --> 00:19:19,569
Uh remove all this this might be a while

242
00:19:20,289 --> 00:19:21,970
No, if I go like this

243
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:43,380
I need to hold on. I need to fit one two more

244
00:19:48,079 --> 00:19:56,559
Fuck. All right tennis ball noises. Uh, let me imitate that

245
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,950
No, I can't risk having a fucking best noise of the year. Are you serious?

246
00:20:01,509 --> 00:20:09,480
That's all back loaded. Well, maybe I should try to do like a

247
00:20:10,359 --> 00:20:12,359
Of really cool noise

248
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,900
And see if anybody remembers in a year

249
00:20:20,549 --> 00:20:23,910
By not you could make this the worst stream of the year if I will if I wanted to

250
00:20:25,109 --> 00:20:27,680
um

251
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:33,839
I don't know. Should I could I should I just like game everything? Well, because now you can't vote for it

252
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:47,269
Oh, no more dru puzzles. I got it. Don't worry. I got this i'm not gonna make this

253
00:20:48,069 --> 00:20:50,470
We're just gonna start it everybody. It's been like 15 minutes

254
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:57,750
You are look how could this be the worst stream of the year you already got like a fuck the wiimote rant in the first 10 minutes

255
00:20:58,549 --> 00:21:00,630
That can't be the worst stream of the year. What are you talking about?

256
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,240
true

257
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,880
All right, let's get him. We keep going

258
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:16,309
This is I think this is good. I think all this is good except maybe here

259
00:21:22,849 --> 00:21:25,829
How did they ever expect?

260
00:21:25,829 --> 00:21:30,690
I need to clean slate over here

261
00:21:30,769 --> 00:21:33,970
I I definitely could not do this when I was younger

262
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:37,079
No way

263
00:21:37,079 --> 00:21:39,720
I wouldn't have would you would you have done this?

264
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:46,519
No, you wouldn't have you would have opened up. You would have opened up like mario instead. You would have gotten this far and gone

265
00:21:47,559 --> 00:21:48,519
um

266
00:21:48,519 --> 00:21:50,519
I want to play ninja turtles

267
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:59,059
Because that was more fun for you. I would have just closed this and opened up turtles in time

268
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:05,700
Which is I mean, I think i've played that game 500 times from the age of like 13 to like 16

269
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:10,660
Do that right now?

270
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:12,660
I'm not i'm not gonna do that right what?

271
00:22:13,299 --> 00:22:15,299
Am I gonna play turtles in time right now?

272
00:22:17,029 --> 00:22:20,950
I mean, it is one of the best games ever made but I can't i'm not gonna do that right now

273
00:22:21,029 --> 00:22:32,549
I'm not gonna do that right now

274
00:22:32,549 --> 00:22:37,349
I'm not doing it right now. I'm not doing it right now. I i'm not gonna betray the the dru crew

275
00:22:41,269 --> 00:22:44,150
I'm not gonna go get turtles in time right now

276
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:49,779
Do it later. No, that's like a whole stream. I could be I can do that game on hard by the way

277
00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:11,880
Fuck. Okay. Hold on

278
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:20,289
How do I make this two?

279
00:23:20,289 --> 00:23:22,289
He's so bad

280
00:23:22,529 --> 00:23:24,690
You wouldn't have done this you would have you would have

281
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,519
You would have

282
00:23:27,519 --> 00:23:30,799
Gone out and played tether ball. You wouldn't have done this

283
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:34,180
I know because I wouldn't have done it

284
00:23:34,339 --> 00:23:38,900
And I still can't do it at 34. I want to go outside and play tether ball

285
00:23:40,609 --> 00:23:45,490
Fuck turtles in time. If there was a tether ball court behind me. I would go do it right now

286
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:55,170
It wouldn't even be turtles in time. It would be i'm gonna go play tether ball

287
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:09,539
Wait, hold on. How do I make another little one in here?

288
00:24:17,809 --> 00:24:19,809
I know this is right. I know it is

289
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:23,569
This guy actually went outside as a kid

290
00:24:26,599 --> 00:24:34,119
Yeah, and I got hurt a bunch of times and now apparently i'm paying the price for it because my rib cage hurts every day

291
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,039
so

292
00:24:36,039 --> 00:24:55,990
Maybe you should play fucking nancy drew. Wait, hold on bottom right doesn't need that upper dot

293
00:24:57,799 --> 00:24:59,880
Doesn't don't I can't take that one off

294
00:25:01,009 --> 00:25:03,650
The ones that are the one with the pegs on them are the ones I can't be um

295
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:06,210
Split the bottom right into two

296
00:25:19,599 --> 00:25:25,839
This is not possible. I mean it has to be possible because an eighth grade girl beat it. It has to be possible

297
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:40,789
Hold on. Let me get let me do no no click maps. I'm doing this one on my own

298
00:25:48,019 --> 00:25:49,539
No, this is right

299
00:25:49,539 --> 00:25:56,160
This is no, no, no, no shit. Hey, hey, hey. Hey, I did it on my own

300
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,430
Now i'm just gonna figure out how to make these two

301
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,799
Oh shit

302
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:09,829
Yes

303
00:26:09,829 --> 00:26:12,640
It's and he looks injured

304
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:18,119
In the ice pack

305
00:26:18,119 --> 00:26:20,599
Uh, so am I gonna help him or am I just gonna say oh no

306
00:26:25,029 --> 00:26:27,269
Okay, what was it? What was the point of that wooden gear?

307
00:26:29,119 --> 00:26:39,539
All right. Let's go talk to him. Let's see what's wrong with him. You all right. Oh, um, hi

308
00:26:43,799 --> 00:26:46,359
Uh, what happened? What happened to your face?

309
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:49,460
gunner happened specifically

310
00:26:50,339 --> 00:26:54,339
Gunner threw a bottle at me. That's awful. Why would he do that?

311
00:26:55,059 --> 00:26:57,779
Does he need a reason it's happened twice before

312
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:03,220
Now do you see what i've had to deal with all these years a lesser man than I would have practiced things

313
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:10,259
And quietly retired to a nice beach somewhere. I could easily take my work to Reykjavik. I don't know why I stay

314
00:27:10,819 --> 00:27:15,779
Some you could but you want sense of hope maybe you have you've got a great thing going on here

315
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:18,099
You've got

316
00:27:18,099 --> 00:27:24,740
Fucking a whole business here. I'll take care of that motherfucker. Don't worry. Dagny is missing. I'm worried something happened to her

317
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:28,500
Missing are you sure she didn't go for a stroll?

318
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:34,769
No, she's gone left a heater even once the entire time i've been here

319
00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:36,670
that's

320
00:27:36,670 --> 00:27:37,890
suspicious

321
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:44,450
Hmm, if she hasn't returned soon, i'll organize a search party in the meantime. Try not to worry. She's a tough woman

322
00:27:44,769 --> 00:27:46,769
I'm certain she'll manage. Goodbye

343
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:39,119
What do I do with this?

344
00:29:39,119 --> 00:29:41,119
It's not one two three four

345
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,680
It's not one two three four. I know it's not

346
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:49,670
I'm 99 positive. It's not one two three four. It might be four three two one

347
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:58,720
But I don't think so. How was my christmas? It was great. I hope yours was good, too

00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:04,519
Did you try it? No. All right, i'm gonna i'll try the damn one. All right, i'll try it here

349
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:13,160
If that worked I would have been so mad

350
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:18,900
All right

351
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,900
Let's go. Let's go back to the cabin

352
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:28,549
Didn't I get something? I got something out of a dog bed. So let me go there

353
00:30:36,759 --> 00:30:38,759
Fuck this boat by the way

354
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:44,680
It's so easy just to turn around on this boat and i'm trying to go over here. I'm just trying to go the all right

355
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:54,019

357
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,920
All right. Let's go to the captain's quarters

358
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:10,529
What what the fuck does what does this thing do I still don't know what this thing does

359
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,920
Not a single clue on earth

00:31:18,529 --> 00:31:22,309
Uh zero one two three, maybe

361
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:33,779
Hold on a minute

There's so much stuff. I have so much stuff in my inventory. I haven't played this in like seven days

365
00:31:47,599 --> 00:31:49,119
Let's just get on the right track

366
00:31:49,119 --> 00:31:52,160
It's okay to be on training wheels as long as eventually you take them off

367
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:57,329
It's a shameless cheater. Call it what you want. It's I call it

It's just for it's just to get us on the right track. You can take the training you can take the wheels off soon

370
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:14,970

371
00:32:23,829 --> 00:32:25,829

Something about a bed frame with a bed frame note

397
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:37,250

Did I pee into the weed disc tray? I don't understand how that works. What is this?

488
00:47:02,579 --> 00:47:08,739
Is it year a year and a date

489
00:47:09,460 --> 00:47:18,059
I don't know re recreate the numbers written on the corner of the big oh wait 19

00:47:41,519 --> 00:47:45,809
Fuck all right. How does this puzzle work? This is five. I don't understand what's work

493
00:47:55,559 --> 00:47:57,880
The water stopped but the gate still shut

494
00:48:00,679 --> 00:48:02,199
Nancy

495
00:48:02,199 --> 00:48:04,760
Are you all right? You did this get me out of here

496
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:11,360
Worst joke of 2019 you can't nominate that for anything and I don't think I don't even think that's the case

497
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:13,519
Let's see. Damn it. Do I really have to do this shit?

498
00:48:14,639 --> 00:48:18,880
All right, fine. Fine. Fine. Let's let's let's open up the next one. What is it? I got the dlc

499
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:23,789
It was 15 bucks. God damn it crack

500
00:48:24,599 --> 00:48:27,360
Okay, let's go

501
00:48:27,769 --> 00:48:29,769
Pain in the ass

502
00:48:30,650 --> 00:48:42,329
I don't think I don't think that's that bad. I think that I think I would laugh at that if I was me

503
00:48:45,289 --> 00:48:47,659
What are these images?

504
00:48:48,380 --> 00:48:53,239
I

505
00:49:15,210 --> 00:49:20,329
Is the best image of the year but it's too bad none of this counts like none of it counts

506
00:49:21,369 --> 00:49:23,369
Holy shit, that's fucking hilarious

507
00:49:32,889 --> 00:49:36,489

All right, that's fucking fantastic

512
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:21,840
Someone's trying to get me out of the picture. Oh, that's an understatement. It looks like i'm eating

513
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:24,320
I look like a gerbil or a hamster

514
00:50:25,039 --> 00:50:30,320
Looks like that was the right decision. It's like a hamster with ice cream sandwiches storing them for winter

515
00:50:32,079 --> 00:50:34,880
Here whoever attacked you dropped this in the hold

516
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:40,730
Okay, maybe it will be of help to you. Definitely. Thanks

517
00:50:41,130 --> 00:50:47,769

518
00:50:49,610 --> 00:50:52,889

Can't check that still have to can't check that off yet

521
00:51:01,159 --> 00:51:11,449
It's a metal crank. What was that for?

522
00:51:19,579 --> 00:51:23,019
Hey, can I nominate this stream so far? It's the best stream of the year

523
00:51:25,099 --> 00:51:28,380
Something about nancy drew. I don't know what I don't know what nancy drew does to me

Why would you put this in the notes?

538
00:52:37,699 --> 00:52:40,179
Why wouldn't you just use code words or something?

539
00:52:41,239 --> 00:52:45,880
Why wouldn't you say like this is for uh, cleaning up after the cat if you know what I mean?

540
00:52:46,679 --> 00:52:53,340
Like oh, okay. Why like for lou for petra extraction. This is all illegal shit, right?

541
00:52:56,139 --> 00:52:59,900
Yeah, there's an attack. I'm talking about the attached message not the bank

00:54:02,460 --> 00:54:05,219

00:54:05,219 --> 00:54:11,539
All right. What about uh magnus so magnus knew he was being followed something's following me closer. Lock everything down

555
00:54:12,420 --> 00:54:17,460
Okay, mr. Melodramatic. Are we starting to just get a little paranoid? What about the dock pylon? Are you dropping that?

556
00:54:18,099 --> 00:54:19,539
I'm serious

557
00:54:19,539 --> 00:54:21,780
You'll have to wait on the final piece. We discussed

558
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:26,739
What i'm not gonna do accents. It's gonna be boris impression. You can't even look for it. So, you know, well fuck it

559
00:54:26,739 --> 00:54:29,139
I don't even care. Uh, what are you where are you putting it?

560
00:54:30,420 --> 00:54:34,980
Uh bed frame on the ship magic circles, uh venn diagrams. The key is the overlapping sections

561
00:54:36,099 --> 00:54:40,579
There are five pieces. You have one. I have one. Where are the remaining three? How could they have gotten so lost?

562
00:54:42,019 --> 00:54:45,300
You're not making sense calm down have a breath eat some eat a banana

563
00:54:46,809 --> 00:54:49,289
All right. Now I can actually go to the bed thing. That's all I wanted

564
00:55:02,860 --> 00:55:06,059
By the way, if you do have a strong opinion on anything

565
00:55:06,699 --> 00:55:08,139
I recommend you go

566
00:55:08,139 --> 00:55:10,460
uh, take a few minutes of your time if you feel like it

567
00:55:11,340 --> 00:55:13,340
to vote for the

568
00:55:14,059 --> 00:55:18,139
23 different categories for worst and best of the year for 2019

569
00:55:20,460 --> 00:55:22,539
Check out that survey monkey link. That is a real link

570
00:55:23,260 --> 00:55:25,000
Check it out

571
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,760
probably take you a

572
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:29,960
Because there's a lot of clips it's a lot to go through so maybe

573
00:55:31,289 --> 00:55:36,170
Take your time with it. Make sure because that once you vote that's it and we will see the results on new york

574
00:55:40,090 --> 00:55:45,929
Why are you still using survey monkey because uh, because the four hundred dollar yearly activation went through

575
00:55:46,550 --> 00:55:48,650
Uh automatically three or four months ago

576
00:55:49,610 --> 00:55:51,610
Because I didn't cancel it. So

577
00:55:52,250 --> 00:55:53,769
That's uh, that's why

578
00:55:53,769 --> 00:55:55,929
So I have but might as well use the damn thing

579
00:55:56,650 --> 00:56:02,550
Yeah

580
00:56:02,550 --> 00:56:04,630
Yeah, I know. Yeah, and guess what?

581
00:56:05,190 --> 00:56:11,269
Uh, I probably will forget to cancel it again after this stream because it's I will be have been kind of over that stream

582
00:56:11,590 --> 00:56:18,469
And moving on to the next stuff and we'll see you next year. Uh when I have not canceled my survey monkey

583
00:56:19,489 --> 00:56:23,269
Ridiculously overpriced hundreds of dollars per year, I guess subscription

584
00:56:24,070 --> 00:56:26,070
pictures of a blank wall

585
00:56:26,550 --> 00:56:29,829
Either cancel it now losing it or I can't this is a clue i'm busy

586
00:56:39,050 --> 00:56:41,289
All right, the back wall

587
00:56:41,289 --> 00:56:43,289
All right, let's go to back to the captain's quarters

588
00:56:46,039 --> 00:56:48,219
So now I can actually look at the bed

589
00:56:48,219 --> 00:56:50,219
That fucking trophy picture is so funny

590
00:56:50,619 --> 00:56:56,309
He's too busy to save four hundred dollars. Well, I already lost four hundred dollars

591
00:56:57,289 --> 00:57:00,329
I can't get that back. It went through like four months ago

592
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:06,300
So I have like seven months to not spend four hundred dollars again

593
00:57:16,599 --> 00:57:18,599
Why is it so bright?

594
00:57:22,340 --> 00:57:26,500
This is this is droopy the dog like going to heaven

595
00:57:28,889 --> 00:57:30,570
Droopy the dog

596
00:57:30,570 --> 00:57:34,329
All right. This is droopy the dog like does too much molly

597
00:57:36,579 --> 00:57:44,340
What the fuck droopy the dog does two smokes too much cracking that goes to heaven

598
00:57:48,780 --> 00:57:50,789
What the fuck?

599
00:57:50,789 --> 00:57:54,119
Oh

600
00:57:54,119 --> 00:58:18,309
Hold on. Hold on

601
00:58:18,869 --> 00:58:23,159
This is so fun

602
00:58:24,329 --> 00:58:26,329
Well, let's try this one. Let's try this one

603
00:58:27,639 --> 00:58:29,800
This is fucking fun. Hold on. Where is it?

604
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:42,380
Uh, I just saved it. Where the fuck is it? Where's my other droopy the dog image that just saved

605
00:58:52,139 --> 00:58:54,139
You're literally an oblivion character

606
00:59:01,159 --> 00:59:04,280
Okay, I have to fucking focus for a second

607
00:59:09,449 --> 00:59:11,449
You need to do that as an emote

608
00:59:15,539 --> 00:59:17,539
All right, everybody relax

609
00:59:18,099 --> 00:59:21,460
It's it. We we're good. Let's go back to where we were going

610
00:59:22,420 --> 00:59:24,789
Check out the bed

611
00:59:24,869 --> 00:59:30,889
Just right here. This is the original captain's bed, then I should take a closer look

612
00:59:32,489 --> 00:59:34,889
There have been diagrams this is gonna be great

613
00:59:36,250 --> 00:59:38,380
Can't wait for this one

614
00:59:38,380 --> 00:59:42,099
I'm just scratching my back

615
00:59:42,099 --> 00:59:45,619
That's fucking really itchy. Okay. Okay. I got it

616
00:59:47,530 --> 00:59:52,969
I need to place the numbers inside the circle so that they add up to the totals within the overlapping sections

617
00:59:53,449 --> 01:00:01,369
Okay, so what place the numbers so that any total any total shown in the overlapping section is the sum of those circles individual numbers

618
01:00:06,139 --> 01:00:09,019
um, okay, so

619
01:00:09,739 --> 01:00:11,739
Whatever is in the circle

620
01:00:13,079 --> 01:00:16,360
How is just so this would this would be seven? Okay

621
01:00:17,559 --> 01:00:18,440
but

622
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:20,840
You gotta

623
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:24,699
Holy shit

624
01:00:24,699 --> 01:00:27,849
This is easy

625
01:00:27,849 --> 01:00:29,289
I mean

626
01:00:29,289 --> 01:00:33,610
Oh, I don't nothing has to spin. Oh, wait, wait. No, this is this is easy. Nothing has to spin

627
01:00:35,139 --> 01:00:37,619
Cool. All right. I thought I had to like spin these things around

628
01:00:41,719 --> 01:00:43,239
so, uh

629
01:00:43,239 --> 01:00:44,760
Let's see the sum

630
01:00:44,760 --> 01:00:48,360
Of everything in the overlapping circles. This would be 33 what?

631
01:00:52,059 --> 01:00:57,019
Total shown in the overlapping is the sum of those individual numbers. So like it it would have to be

632
01:00:57,820 --> 01:01:00,460
We'd have to make 80 we'd have to make 23

633
01:01:05,349 --> 01:01:06,949
So that would be

634
01:01:06,949 --> 01:01:14,519
I still I don't I still don't get it. I still don't understand

635
01:01:15,079 --> 01:01:17,079
I'll get it in a second

636
01:01:22,489 --> 01:01:24,760
Uh

637
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:28,519
All right. This is the last droopy image for a while and then we're gonna move on

638
01:01:31,030 --> 01:01:33,030
This is the final droop with the dog

639
01:01:35,190 --> 01:01:49,659
This one's pretty damn good though

640
01:01:49,739 --> 01:01:53,019
It's just droopy the dog hitting his favorite jewel

641
01:01:53,900 --> 01:02:06,679
What do you mean? Not that one? Jesus

642
01:02:08,199 --> 01:02:10,940
Christ

643
01:02:10,940 --> 01:02:16,139
Oh my god, how do you do this this quickly this yeah, how do you even do this this fast?

644
01:02:17,099 --> 01:02:20,230
It's not even possible to do it this fast

645
01:02:21,300 --> 01:02:23,300
It's been like 12 minutes

646
01:02:23,780 --> 01:02:27,369
This is ridiculous

647
01:02:40,280 --> 01:02:42,440
This is now the thumbnail. I know it is

648
01:02:43,900 --> 01:02:46,059
Right click set as desktop wallpaper

649
01:02:47,019 --> 01:02:50,860
Here's one that isn't droopy

650
01:02:52,340 --> 01:02:54,659
Oh my fucking god, what is going on?

651
01:02:57,820 --> 01:03:01,579
This is just the Grinch. This is like the Grinch with no makeup

652
01:03:02,460 --> 01:03:04,139
eating spaghetti

653
01:03:04,139 --> 01:03:11,539
All right. That's enough. That's enough. That's enough. I'm done

654
01:03:12,099 --> 01:03:24,199
All right, we're gonna do this diagram thing

655
01:03:30,920 --> 01:03:32,679
Oh fuck

656
01:03:32,679 --> 01:03:34,679
I don't know. I don't know. Um

657
01:03:35,690 --> 01:03:37,130
I don't know

658
01:03:37,130 --> 01:03:39,559
I'm not gonna lie. I don't know

659
01:03:41,380 --> 01:03:46,019
If it were me, I mean it is me what I mean if it were me it it it is me

660
01:03:46,179 --> 01:03:48,179
So, of course, it's me

661
01:03:48,179 --> 01:03:50,179
What I would do? Um

662
01:03:55,429 --> 01:04:00,889
place the

663
01:04:00,889 --> 01:04:02,889
So, okay place the numbers

664
01:04:03,130 --> 01:04:10,409
Any total shown in the overlapping is the sum of the circle of some is the sum of those circles individuals the sum

665
01:04:11,849 --> 01:04:13,369
So I need to make

666
01:04:13,369 --> 01:04:15,739
I need to make

667
01:04:15,800 --> 01:04:19,889
23 here

668
01:04:19,909 --> 01:04:22,070
What's 23 like eight seven and nine?

669
01:04:22,710 --> 01:04:24,309
And we got a calculator

670
01:04:24,309 --> 01:04:30,260
What is eight nine and seven? What does that do?

671
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:38,250
Windows has a calculator. I can't i'm too busy

672
01:04:38,730 --> 01:04:42,659
He's looking at the answers on the other monitor. I know i'm not

673
01:04:45,719 --> 01:04:49,719
Just look at the walkthrough. No, i'm not doing that. Not yet, you know, sure. No, not yet

674
01:04:51,929 --> 01:04:53,690
No, it's okay. Here we go

675
01:04:53,690 --> 01:04:55,690
All right, so that's 23

676
01:04:55,849 --> 01:05:05,000
So now I have to make 10 here so I need one and then this needs to be 13

677
01:05:06,699 --> 01:05:09,000
Seven

678
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,880
Wait, we don't have six. Wait. No, hold on a minute there

679
01:05:12,840 --> 01:05:14,039
All right

680
01:05:14,039 --> 01:05:17,139
This is actually pretty good. This is a fun puzzle

681
01:05:19,380 --> 01:05:25,139
If you know every single puzzle in your entire game is based off of weird like logic math problems

682
01:05:26,179 --> 01:05:32,860
Okay, now we need to make 10 first of all, let's get this is seven

683
01:05:33,579 --> 01:05:35,820
So we need to make seven out of the okay

684
01:05:37,260 --> 01:05:41,530
There's your seven

685
01:05:41,530 --> 01:05:45,369
There's five

686
01:05:45,369 --> 01:05:47,130
There it is

687
01:05:47,130 --> 01:05:51,210
And if we get more of these sketches i'm fucking jacked up right now. I'm so

688
01:05:51,769 --> 01:05:53,769
I'm so fucking excitable

689
01:05:53,929 --> 01:05:58,409
Why I don't know why you know why i'll tell you why here's why really know why i'm so excitable right now

690
01:05:59,369 --> 01:06:03,050
Because that new year's eve stream is the nominations are done and if it's votable

691
01:06:03,849 --> 01:06:07,630
By the way, if you if you have some time if you want to check out those nominations

692
01:06:11,500 --> 01:06:13,820
They're there and I can't wait. That's sure is gonna be a lot of fun

693
01:06:15,500 --> 01:06:20,539
All right, let's go back to the uh, the thing where I can put the it's like to go back to the cabin in the woods

694
01:06:20,539 --> 01:06:23,860
Very yeah

695
01:06:23,860 --> 01:06:28,119
He's plugging it

696
01:06:28,119 --> 01:06:32,039
Yeah, yeah, you come on. You gotta plug the stream. That is a big one

697
01:06:32,679 --> 01:06:34,679
That's a big that's like the biggest stream of the year

698
01:06:35,480 --> 01:06:38,150
Don't you want to know?

699
01:06:38,150 --> 01:06:40,469
What sound was the best sound of the year?

700
01:06:41,429 --> 01:06:45,349
Don't you want to have wait to find out which peter was the worst one?

701
01:06:46,150 --> 01:06:47,429
That one don't count

702
01:06:47,429 --> 01:07:07,269
Is like in a happy mood right now because i'm gonna play no more heroes tomorrow hopefully well

703
01:07:07,269 --> 01:07:09,269
I was kind of mad earlier, but not anymore

704
01:07:11,780 --> 01:07:15,210
All right, let's get these

705
01:07:15,210 --> 01:07:17,929
What's three plus three times three? That would be

706
01:07:18,889 --> 01:07:20,170
Would be six

707
01:07:20,170 --> 01:07:22,409
That'd be 18. Thank you

708
01:07:22,650 --> 01:07:42,969
I'm not stupid

709
01:07:42,969 --> 01:07:44,969
This song where is it from?

710
01:07:49,139 --> 01:07:51,139
That was wrong. That was actually wrong

711
01:07:51,699 --> 01:07:53,960
Was it though?

712
01:07:53,960 --> 01:08:00,619
What was the question again?

713
01:08:00,619 --> 01:08:02,619
This looks like it goes

714
01:08:02,940 --> 01:08:05,960
Okay

715
01:08:05,960 --> 01:08:16,779
Oh, this is wrong

716
01:08:16,939 --> 01:08:21,260
Looks like i'm still missing still missing a piece of this puzzle is stupid

717
01:08:22,460 --> 01:08:27,180
North american education lol. Yeah. Yeah, you know, it'll be great if we could like

718
01:08:28,300 --> 01:08:30,539
If we could redo our entire educational system

719
01:08:31,100 --> 01:08:36,149
That's correct

720
01:08:36,149 --> 01:08:48,380
We need it. We need better schooling. We need better

721
01:08:49,020 --> 01:08:51,260
We need better schools in this country

722
01:08:52,819 --> 01:08:56,579
See if I was a presidential candidate, I would get on stage right and during like the debates

723
01:08:57,140 --> 01:09:00,100
Mr. Albertson, uh, so sorry. Excuse me. Senator Albertson

724
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:05,159
uh during your time and senator you you made very clear that you would like to have a

725
01:09:06,100 --> 01:09:08,520
Educational reform can you explain why that's your policy?

726
01:09:09,479 --> 01:09:12,359
And I would simply say yeah, I will tell you exactly why

727
01:09:12,920 --> 01:09:14,520
I'm 41

728
01:09:14,520 --> 01:09:16,680
And do not know my multiplication tables

729
01:09:18,710 --> 01:09:21,750
I didn't know how to write a check until I was 20

730
01:09:23,989 --> 01:09:25,989
And I still don't understand

731
01:09:27,020 --> 01:09:35,109
At all and then I would stop and I would freeze for a second and my and my eyes would cross

732
01:09:35,670 --> 01:09:38,869
And then I'd blink a couple times ago. Sorry. What was the question?

733
01:09:40,119 --> 01:09:42,359
And even if I got fucking booed off the stage

734
01:09:42,920 --> 01:09:47,319
It wouldn't even matter because then they would know like holy shit our education system sucks

735
01:09:49,289 --> 01:09:58,920
This guy's get this guy out of here or i'd get a standing ovation. What a gaffe

736
01:10:01,670 --> 01:10:09,689
Legit I have never wrote a check. Yeah, we we have like they can think of it like like our like our sex education, right?

737
01:10:11,420 --> 01:10:13,100
even something like just

738
01:10:13,100 --> 01:10:15,260
Just let us know some stuff. You know what I mean? Like

739
01:10:15,979 --> 01:10:18,220
I let us know just some stuff

740
01:10:24,710 --> 01:10:26,949
Every okay, there was health class

741
01:10:27,829 --> 01:10:34,569
And health class did this thing where I know a lot of you guys probably had a similar experience and correct me if i'm wrong

742
01:10:35,460 --> 01:10:36,979
health class

743
01:10:36,979 --> 01:10:38,420
was typically

744
01:10:38,420 --> 01:10:44,460
Some old lady that when we got to the point where we were going to do sex education

745
01:10:44,539 --> 01:10:50,300
It was like, oh my god. Lol. Look at the lady. The old lady say the word penis. Isn't that so funny?

746
01:10:51,720 --> 01:10:56,789
We weren't learning anything

747
01:10:56,789 --> 01:10:58,149
Okay today kids

748
01:10:58,149 --> 01:11:04,069
What I would like to do is yeah up and up to the page 20c to see penis and everyone would be like

749
01:11:04,470 --> 01:11:12,090
Oh my god, she said it. We got to rethink how we're teaching our children

750
01:11:12,649 --> 01:11:22,579
Otherwise, you end up like me. That's your fault

751
01:11:29,100 --> 01:11:31,100
No, no anything but that

752
01:11:35,020 --> 01:11:36,380
I would love

753
01:11:36,380 --> 01:11:41,340
Just a simple. I don't know why they don't do this. Yeah, sure. We're going off right now and i'm going off

754
01:11:41,340 --> 01:11:44,329
I'll tell you i'm hot tonight

755
01:11:44,329 --> 01:11:47,289
Why don't we just have a simple life skills class?

756
01:11:50,439 --> 01:11:56,119
What's the why don't why can't we just do that? Why do we have to why can't we just do a life skills class to?

757
01:11:57,899 --> 01:12:00,710
This is gonna sound crazy

758
01:12:00,710 --> 01:12:04,789
But I don't know i'm gonna get a lot of shit for this people gonna make fun of me. I know you are

759
01:12:05,670 --> 01:12:10,710
But uh, but this is this even a life skill. I didn't know how to tie my shoes correctly until I was like 15

760
01:12:11,800 --> 01:12:14,760
That is that a life skill. It might be a life skill. I didn't really get it

761
01:12:14,840 --> 01:12:16,920
I just kind of mushed it up and and

762
01:12:17,960 --> 01:12:27,479
And like did it wrong every time imagine. They just taught us how to tie our shoes. Do they they do

763
01:12:27,800 --> 01:12:30,359
Yeah, they do when you're like four

764
01:12:30,359 --> 01:12:34,520
But they should be repeating that information into like our early teens and early 20s

765
01:12:35,159 --> 01:12:37,159
Fuck, okay. Let's go

766
01:12:41,189 --> 01:12:43,350
No, but all jokes aside all fucking around

767
01:12:44,739 --> 01:12:50,260
They we got to be told about like our tag tag system life skills writing checks credit

768
01:12:52,060 --> 01:12:57,260
How many of you guys in this chat right now even know he's still what fucking credit even does?

769
01:13:00,659 --> 01:13:17,260
It took me until I was like fucking 28. He's right manga s

770
01:13:17,979 --> 01:13:27,189
Thank you. Derma. Your sex edit understanding is on par with goku

771
01:13:30,890 --> 01:13:32,890
I don't I don't understand that reference

772
01:13:33,050 --> 01:13:44,039
What do you uh, okay now I do wait. Hold on a minute here. Hold on

773
01:13:46,340 --> 01:13:52,579
Do you guys still think that at 34? I still I don't know what like

774
01:13:53,460 --> 01:13:57,319
Sex is

775
01:13:57,319 --> 01:13:59,319
Am I do I just not know this?

776
01:14:00,840 --> 01:14:02,840
I still don't know what it is

777
01:14:07,479 --> 01:14:14,069
What the fuck

778
01:14:14,949 --> 01:14:16,949
Somebody says to teach me

779
01:14:22,899 --> 01:14:26,340
No, but seriously we like i've said this before

780
01:14:27,989 --> 01:14:34,380
But I think we got we got to reimagine how we're teaching our children and bringing up our students

781
01:14:35,180 --> 01:14:39,050
They got to be ready

782
01:14:39,050 --> 01:14:41,270
They got to be ready

783
01:14:41,270 --> 01:14:43,989
And we're we're teaching them stuff that they're not we're not preparing them

784
01:14:50,250 --> 01:14:52,569
Just play nancy drew mr. Comcast

785
01:14:53,529 --> 01:14:55,529
No, this is important stuff

786
01:14:56,090 --> 01:15:10,739
Do I still know what this does?

787
01:15:14,409 --> 01:15:16,409
Your time is up. Mr. Albertson

788
01:15:19,989 --> 01:15:22,149
That was just me talking the whole time as the senator

789
01:15:25,109 --> 01:15:28,949
Uh, mr. Albertson, you spoke 12 minutes over what you were supposed to

790
01:15:31,590 --> 01:15:35,909
And can you please stop doing the i'm crossing my eyes to make a point?

791
01:15:36,630 --> 01:15:38,489
joke

792
01:15:38,489 --> 01:15:45,850
Sorry. Sorry. Yeah going

793
01:15:45,850 --> 01:15:47,850
My fucking eyes hurt

794
01:15:50,739 --> 01:15:54,039
Haven't can't can't check that off yet a filibuster

795
01:15:57,029 --> 01:15:59,029
They don't teach taxes. No, they don't

796
01:15:59,859 --> 01:16:01,859
No, you're just you're just expected

797
01:16:02,659 --> 01:16:03,859
to just

798
01:16:03,859 --> 01:16:08,020
Hey, hey, you know like the the 700 pages of tax code. Did you know that right?

799
01:16:09,060 --> 01:16:10,020
No

800
01:16:10,020 --> 01:16:21,460
Oh idiot

801
01:16:21,460 --> 01:16:22,659
Get good

802
01:16:22,659 --> 01:16:29,510
Oh, you cannot treat something as important as as as tax code as like playing dark souls

803
01:16:32,520 --> 01:16:39,000
You have to actually go to wiki pages and like and and government websites to find out certain thing. It really is playing dark souls

804
01:16:40,220 --> 01:16:42,300
Taxes is just dark souls on paper

805
01:16:48,710 --> 01:16:53,909
Oh, I um, is this is can I take that deduction? I don't know. Can you?

806
01:16:55,579 --> 01:16:57,420
Um, I don't know

807
01:16:57,420 --> 01:16:59,739
Look it up on the wiki

808
01:16:59,739 --> 01:17:04,220
Oh, okay. I guess i'll i'll look it up on the wiki for every question. I have like yeah

809
01:17:06,439 --> 01:17:08,439
Wait, yeah, you don't know that. Why do you not know that?

810
01:17:09,479 --> 01:17:11,800
Uh, okay. I I don't know. I've never done that before

811
01:17:13,140 --> 01:17:16,739
Holy shit, dude. I did I did it in less than two hours

812
01:17:18,170 --> 01:17:19,210
Okay

01:17:19,210 --> 01:17:29,029
Can I help why is everyone in your world an asshole?

814
01:17:32,619 --> 01:17:35,739
Is it true that the town's in financial trouble? Uh

815
01:17:36,760 --> 01:17:41,880
In the spirit nobody's nice in this like the universe apparently we've always had a bit of trouble everybody's horrible

816
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,960
No spas no ski resorts. We're a little uh

817
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:48,600
barren elizabeth

818
01:17:48,600 --> 01:17:55,159
Bless her. Oh, oh, oh fuck. What the hell man. Come on, but it's just not oh, I hurt myself

819
01:17:57,560 --> 01:18:02,600
How did this happen what is this and why do I have it in my hand the way the ship writes yes

820
01:18:02,760 --> 01:18:05,560
Why are we playing with this back in the black of course

821
01:18:17,210 --> 01:18:23,050
Where did I get that I don't know where I got that I don't know where that's from it just was here apparently

822
01:18:23,210 --> 01:18:26,069
What the fuck that actually hurts?

823
01:18:28,539 --> 01:18:31,260
Why was your glove found up near the volcanic caves?

824
01:18:32,229 --> 01:18:34,329
My glove

825
01:18:34,329 --> 01:18:38,090
I'm certain it was yours. Aha my glove. I

826
01:18:38,649 --> 01:18:44,569
Lost it. Aha when I was trying to carry a bit of wood down from the hills. I was rather focused

827
01:18:44,970 --> 01:18:46,390
I can get a bit

828
01:18:46,390 --> 01:18:50,090
Adle-brained I found the most interesting carving you see in

829
01:18:50,649 --> 01:18:56,569
Part of an old tree near the caves. It may even be from the 14th century or even earlier

830
01:18:58,170 --> 01:19:00,170
Where's the carving you brought back? Oh

831
01:19:00,729 --> 01:19:05,850
It needs to be treated before it can be exposed to the air again. If you'd like I can show you later on

832
01:19:06,649 --> 01:19:10,729
Uh, sure. Have you always lived here for 12 years in total?

833
01:19:11,770 --> 01:19:16,810
Two before university 10 after others seem to think of you as an outsider

834
01:19:17,449 --> 01:19:19,449
gunner, especially

835
01:19:19,449 --> 01:19:23,289
Oh for the love of him. I was born 10 miles away

836
01:19:24,729 --> 01:19:30,970
And that means you don't live here to him. Yes, I mean to everyone. Yes, I don't I hate this game

837
01:19:31,930 --> 01:19:35,770
I'll never be from skit brought because I wasn't born here. You know, I mean that

838
01:19:36,649 --> 01:19:39,289
Upper secondary school was a nightmare with these people

839
01:19:40,010 --> 01:19:44,810
I may not know much about skip brought but there are lots of unpleasant people in my line of work

840
01:19:45,529 --> 01:19:52,170
Sometimes persistence helps. Oh, i've tried i've bent over backwards to put on this festival for them and yet

841
01:19:52,649 --> 01:19:55,449
No one invites me out. I'm not welcome at the pub

842
01:19:56,090 --> 01:19:59,770
Spending my birthday alone is getting to be a real downer. Bye. Bye

843
01:20:00,729 --> 01:20:02,729
Well on with it

844
01:20:02,890 --> 01:20:04,649
Bye

845
01:20:04,649 --> 01:20:06,649
Spill your guts to me

846
01:20:06,649 --> 01:20:08,569
Bye

847
01:20:08,569 --> 01:20:12,329
All right. So fine. Still have can't check still have to do that. All right

848
01:20:12,970 --> 01:20:15,720
I got that shit now. I have to do

849
01:20:22,949 --> 01:20:28,779
What the hell do I do now? Oh, right with the bricks. Remember the brick walls?

850
01:20:31,130 --> 01:20:33,130
Posture check it should be okay

851
01:20:38,659 --> 01:20:40,859
um

852
01:20:40,859 --> 01:20:46,380
Where uh, where was that? There was that room. I was looking at the wall

853
01:20:47,340 --> 01:20:50,859
She's like, oh there's something behind that wall. I think it's back here, right?

854
01:20:51,899 --> 01:21:00,819
Yeah, it's down here

855
01:21:00,819 --> 01:21:02,659
And then there's a back wall

856
01:21:02,659 --> 01:21:03,699
over there

857
01:21:03,699 --> 01:21:06,500
Where is this wall?

858
01:21:06,500 --> 01:21:13,189
With the brick. Yeah, there's like a wall somewhere right there. See

859
01:21:17,430 --> 01:21:33,670
What's with this wall shine flashlight at the wall use the hook

860
01:21:36,579 --> 01:21:50,149
What just happened?

861
01:21:50,229 --> 01:21:52,229
Hope that shit i'm trying

862
01:21:52,229 --> 01:21:57,960
I heard it

863
01:21:57,960 --> 01:22:01,350
It was like a

864
01:22:02,539 --> 01:22:08,810
Wait, I heard something else

865
01:22:09,770 --> 01:22:19,000
Oh

866
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:26,420
Try the gear

867
01:22:26,739 --> 01:22:27,939
Frank

868
01:22:27,939 --> 01:22:29,939
No, what about the note?

869
01:22:30,500 --> 01:22:34,579
No, this is pressure cooking. So this is this is how i've gone with his old thing. Well update gone on his head

870
01:22:34,819 --> 01:22:37,619
What what's this picture for then? Where's her phone?

871
01:22:41,859 --> 01:22:47,260
I don't think I can do anything with this yet. No, I can't do anything with this

872
01:22:48,220 --> 01:22:50,220
Shit

873
01:22:52,739 --> 01:22:54,739
Can I go back down here

874
01:22:59,720 --> 01:23:01,239
All right, um

875
01:23:01,239 --> 01:23:19,750
I don't know. What the what is this for?

876
01:23:22,060 --> 01:23:24,220
This is for something too. I just don't know what

877
01:23:25,100 --> 01:23:29,060
Derma darling be careful. I'm trying

878
01:23:29,939 --> 01:23:37,300
He doesn't know. No, I don't know

879
01:23:37,939 --> 01:23:45,350
I'm gonna go try to figure out this puzzle or uh open up the walkthrough and just and and lie to you guys and pretend

880
01:23:45,350 --> 01:23:47,350
Like i'm playing the game

881
01:23:47,430 --> 01:23:49,609
Which one do you think I should do?

882
01:23:50,250 --> 01:23:58,149
You know what I mean? I wonder if I should be like, let's see. What was that one?

883
01:23:59,189 --> 01:24:03,670
Three. No, that's not right. One two and then eventually get it even though i'm looking at the paper over here on the right

884
01:24:04,149 --> 01:24:19,180
um

885
01:24:22,149 --> 01:24:24,470
Six and then what was the last one? I think it was three five

886
01:24:25,670 --> 01:24:27,670
Oh, no, that makes sense

887
01:24:29,250 --> 01:24:31,909
Something within the ship must have unlocked elsewhere

888
01:24:37,130 --> 01:24:39,130
He's bad at the game. No, i'm not

889
01:24:42,180 --> 01:24:44,180
Nothing unlocked on the ship

890
01:24:50,010 --> 01:24:58,600
What did it unlock?

891
01:24:58,600 --> 01:25:00,600
Oh the wall the wall the wall

892
01:25:02,409 --> 01:25:10,170
That would make sense, wouldn't it?

893
01:25:10,170 --> 01:25:12,170
Let's see room back. Ah

894
01:25:12,170 --> 01:25:16,329
It looks like it was concealed in the ship's lining. There we go. All right secret

895
01:25:16,970 --> 01:25:18,970
Let's get in here

896
01:25:18,970 --> 01:25:23,050
Oh, what's this? Looks like I need to press another math problem according to these numbers

897
01:25:24,970 --> 01:25:27,609
Light up all the numbers by pressing the correct sections

898
01:25:28,569 --> 01:25:33,340
It's like a dartboard

899
01:25:33,340 --> 01:25:47,289
Oh, you can only do a certain amount of times. All right, over said

900
01:25:48,090 --> 01:26:16,359
I'm gonna get these ones shit. Okay, why did that make like a you open the door sound that that made like a

901
01:26:17,479 --> 01:26:25,340
Oh, it's just the boat is making all kinds of weird noise

902
01:26:26,220 --> 01:26:51,609
All right. Hold on. Here we go. Someone dm me the history and origin behind germa walked

903
01:26:52,890 --> 01:26:54,439
um

904
01:26:54,439 --> 01:26:56,439
It's just the way that I walk man

905
01:26:56,520 --> 01:26:58,520
All right. Ah

906
01:26:58,520 --> 01:27:09,909
This is so easy a child could do it

907
01:27:12,390 --> 01:27:17,500
That's fine. Is it so easy for a child to do it like me?

908
01:27:18,460 --> 01:27:20,460
Here we go

909
01:27:20,699 --> 01:27:24,729
It's a machine of sorts, but some pieces are missing

910
01:27:25,930 --> 01:27:27,930
It's just an adjacent puzzle

911
01:27:28,890 --> 01:27:30,970
There's more shit missing here

912
01:27:31,770 --> 01:27:38,619
What the what how is this? I need two more gears

913
01:27:39,659 --> 01:27:41,659
nancy

914
01:27:45,930 --> 01:27:48,680
Egg

915
01:27:48,840 --> 01:27:53,380
At least I get to dump some of that shit in my inventory

916
01:27:54,739 --> 01:27:56,739
All right. So now I got that

917
01:27:57,060 --> 01:28:02,250
That's all I can do here. Is there anything else in this room?

918
01:28:03,050 --> 01:28:05,050
Not I don't know the secret rooms

919
01:28:05,050 --> 01:28:08,680
There's jam a hook in there

920
01:28:08,760 --> 01:28:14,300
That would be like a decent idea. I think what she says. Hmm. You're doing it wrong. Um, yeah

921
01:28:16,060 --> 01:28:17,739
Yeah, I think so

922
01:28:17,739 --> 01:28:19,340
You'd be right

923
01:28:19,340 --> 01:28:27,060
Uh, i'm gonna go back up

924
01:28:27,619 --> 01:28:30,500
Did I do everything I can in here? I think so

925
01:28:35,659 --> 01:28:40,539
What am I missing

926
01:28:40,539 --> 01:28:42,539
Dream crew he requires aid

927
01:28:44,810 --> 01:28:46,810
Yeah, what should I look at now?

928
01:28:46,810 --> 01:28:48,810
Although I I would assume none of you, uh

929
01:28:49,210 --> 01:28:51,579
None of you guys will really know

930
01:28:54,539 --> 01:28:56,539
You know, I don't think anybody's going

931
01:29:04,939 --> 01:29:07,979
I i'm it's either it's it's me. I gotta figure this out on my own

932
01:29:08,539 --> 01:29:13,079
You know what I mean?

933
01:29:13,079 --> 01:29:16,199
Because even if you guys tell me what to do there get out of my pub

934
01:29:17,640 --> 01:29:23,479
Enough already just leave me be I never asked for you to intervene just stay where I can't see you

935
01:29:24,359 --> 01:29:30,630
We just got thrown out of the pub

936
01:29:30,869 --> 01:29:52,979
To follow him. Where are you? Oh, wait, this is like I can touch his stuff

937
01:29:53,939 --> 01:29:56,420
Elizabeth I love you so much. I feel like it's been forever since college

938
01:29:56,819 --> 01:30:01,859
I wish you were here with me in Paris. The food is amazing. The skyline is to die for how's old moody magnus

939
01:30:02,420 --> 01:30:04,420
Has he gotten that ship obsession thing under control?

940
01:30:04,899 --> 01:30:08,180
Sorry to hear about the demotion and all that financial trouble with soren

941
01:30:08,899 --> 01:30:10,399
the

942
01:30:10,399 --> 01:30:11,779
Gag

943
01:30:11,779 --> 01:30:14,180
The gag the guy sounds like a real weirdo

944
01:30:15,939 --> 01:30:20,819
I'm sure it's got nothing to do with you. And besides you always said you wanted to handle the people side of the festival

945
01:30:21,699 --> 01:30:23,460
uh more

946
01:30:23,460 --> 01:30:25,539
More more of this. I don't need it

947
01:30:26,260 --> 01:30:27,380
Got it

948
01:30:27,380 --> 01:30:29,380
Hmm. There's a hole in the cellar

949
01:30:31,050 --> 01:30:31,930
uh

950
01:30:31,930 --> 01:30:34,810
Okay, I think I know where that goes anything else over here

951
01:30:35,850 --> 01:30:44,470
I think that's it. Let's see check. Check it with a lock and a cup of roof. Can't check. Can't check that off. Yeah

952
01:30:44,949 --> 01:30:45,829
Okay

953
01:30:45,829 --> 01:31:11,779
Use the gear. Yeah, so i'm just gonna go back to the uh, well, hold on blast

954
01:31:13,079 --> 01:31:16,920
What did gunner do this time? What did gunner do this time? I actually get some more coffee

955
01:31:17,319 --> 01:31:19,319
And I can no longer bear it

956
01:31:27,239 --> 01:31:29,319
A lot he just has a

957
01:31:30,659 --> 01:31:36,039
Unconventional way of showing it. Do you know what he said? Why there's so many different kinds of dog food

958
01:31:37,399 --> 01:31:43,479
Go to a pet store. Why is it like 700 different dog foods? I don't think that's which one's the good one. Fuck

959
01:31:43,880 --> 01:31:45,880
Madness, but I know you

960
01:31:46,600 --> 01:31:48,600
Untrue words still hurt

961
01:31:48,920 --> 01:31:53,239
What if magnus is hiding from me? What if he doesn't want to be found?

962
01:31:55,029 --> 01:31:57,430
Please leave me alone. I need time to think

963
01:31:58,710 --> 01:32:00,949
I just talked over all that and it was probably important

964
01:32:04,680 --> 01:32:07,220
No, I buy

965
01:32:07,220 --> 01:32:09,880
I buy I did dog food elimination

966
01:32:10,979 --> 01:32:12,180
Okay

967
01:32:12,180 --> 01:32:15,460
You don't know what that means. That means when you have a dog and you go

968
01:32:15,460 --> 01:32:19,460
I really want to take care of my dog. I want my dog to eat. Well, I want to make sure that I have

969
01:32:20,340 --> 01:32:27,449
He's getting nutrition. And so so what you do is you you go to uh, you type in like best dog food

970
01:32:28,329 --> 01:32:33,689
And then you need to scroll through potentially like 30 different ad pages that just put

971
01:32:34,569 --> 01:32:38,729
You know, well this one's the best one because uh, somebody told us it was and paid us

972
01:32:39,449 --> 01:32:44,489
Uh, there's so many different ones. Uh, you eliminate all the ones that are junk food brands

973
01:32:44,729 --> 01:32:49,770
And then you have to go to the natural the good ones right this this quotes there's good ones

974
01:32:50,649 --> 01:32:53,050
So after you eliminate the Doritos of dog food

975
01:32:56,470 --> 01:32:59,109
Some of these dog food brands guys, holy shit

976
01:33:00,500 --> 01:33:06,180
It is just crushed up Doritos water and cornstarch is pretty much what your dog is eating. Um

977
01:33:08,069 --> 01:33:10,890
Grain free. Yeah, he eats blue buffalo

978
01:33:12,069 --> 01:33:13,829
and it was like

979
01:33:13,909 --> 01:33:18,069
The formulation is like grain free it's like meats and and vegetables and shit

980
01:33:18,949 --> 01:33:27,670
Blue buffalo is good. Yeah, and it's and it's it's pretty well priced

981
01:33:29,899 --> 01:33:33,500
I did some I you know, you look up all you find the dog food you want to use and you're like, all right

982
01:33:33,500 --> 01:33:37,340
Is this dog food good and you look at like testing and third party independent studies?

983
01:33:38,300 --> 01:33:43,479
Blue buffalo is i'm not gonna say that out loud

984
01:33:44,119 --> 01:33:50,039
My vet says blue buffalo is trash. Well, that's what I mean. It's you how are you supposed to know anything?

985
01:33:53,720 --> 01:33:56,090
Can somebody explain to me?

986
01:33:56,170 --> 01:33:57,380
Why?

987
01:33:57,380 --> 01:33:59,380
We have toothpaste

988
01:33:59,539 --> 01:34:00,500
that

989
01:34:00,500 --> 01:34:06,819
It's nine out of ten decades dead dead dead decktists recommend colgate for teeth

990
01:34:07,859 --> 01:34:12,100
Why don't nine out of ten vets recommend the same brand of uh of dog food?

991
01:34:14,039 --> 01:34:16,060
I don't understand

992
01:34:16,060 --> 01:34:21,340
Is there a reason look there's like there's like five million different toothpastes and they all agree. Oh, this is the ada

993
01:34:21,819 --> 01:34:23,739
Brand. Yes, that's good

994
01:34:23,739 --> 01:34:25,739
The ada stamps are approval on that one

995
01:34:26,939 --> 01:34:28,939
Why does every dentist

996
01:34:29,579 --> 01:34:31,579
Argue what's a good dog food?

997
01:34:32,279 --> 01:34:36,840
Well blue buffalo isn't very good. Let me tell you you go to a vet down the street blue buffalo is great

998
01:34:37,319 --> 01:34:41,880
You go to another vet. I recommend the shit we sell at our vet. That's wicked expensive

999
01:34:42,760 --> 01:34:44,659
Okay

1000
01:34:44,659 --> 01:34:47,300
Then you go to like the vet in the alleyway and the guy's like, you know

1001
01:34:47,380 --> 01:34:51,779
You could just you could just like give him a steak and cheese sub every day and you'll be fine

1002
01:34:52,020 --> 01:34:54,020
You're like i'm not going back to that guy

1003
01:34:54,420 --> 01:35:13,060
It's hard and there's other oh you dog really should be eating raw food just a raw diet

1004
01:35:14,649 --> 01:35:16,649
Should he though?

1005
01:35:18,899 --> 01:35:20,899
We have this refrigerated section with dog food

1006
01:35:21,060 --> 01:35:23,859
And the refrigerated section has a bunch of food that you need to keep in your fridge

1007
01:35:23,939 --> 01:35:29,859
And it's you you should be feeding that big salami stick that you've cut a slice off and put it in their bowl

1008
01:35:29,939 --> 01:35:32,579
It's a huge like salami thing. Is that good?

1009
01:35:33,939 --> 01:35:36,890
I don't know. My vet didn't tell me to do that

1010
01:35:45,159 --> 01:35:47,399
Yes, that's that's good. Actually. Yes

1011
01:35:53,300 --> 01:35:59,220
Dogs can have a little salami. No, don't feed your dog salami. Don't vote. Do not feed your dog salami

1012
01:36:01,319 --> 01:36:03,319
Do not do that

01:37:40,460 --> 01:37:44,220
I mean like you could have maybe a little bit of banana. That's okay. Just just eat a banana

1030
01:37:48,039 --> 01:37:52,039
Where's this image that I just said? Why am I doing this right now? No, no, no. No somebody fucked me up

1031
01:37:52,439 --> 01:37:55,880

01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:07,000
What was I doing? Get this off my screen?

1034
01:38:09,750 --> 01:38:11,750
Okay

Quick say do something funny

1036
01:38:15,430 --> 01:38:19,109
Not one thing funny. They're not not supposed to be funny. They're supposed to be real life

1037
01:38:21,239 --> 01:38:26,340
All right, i'm just walking in circles, what am I doing? Okay. Um, I have to find

1038
01:38:27,220 --> 01:38:34,649
Bananas have potassium. They're radioactive get out of here

1039
01:38:42,630 --> 01:38:44,949
It's a fucking banana. You're gonna be fine

1040
01:38:46,409 --> 01:38:50,729
All right. What what the what was I just doing can't check still still have to do that

1041
01:38:51,449 --> 01:38:59,699
Potassium explodes in water, you know, you need potassium, right?

1042
01:39:00,579 --> 01:39:02,439
potassium

1043
01:39:02,439 --> 01:39:11,850
Let me know what are you talking about?

1044
01:39:12,470 --> 01:39:16,300
Potassium is not bad for you potassium is radioactive

1045
01:39:17,640 --> 01:39:21,050
What are you guys getting this? It who cares?

1046
01:39:21,689 --> 01:39:26,970
It's probably like point zero point two percent microns or something for radioactive level

1047
01:39:29,239 --> 01:39:33,720
God my bathtub is probably more radioactive than 500 bananas

1048
01:39:34,439 --> 01:39:43,960
Who cares?

1049
01:39:43,960 --> 01:39:55,500
All right. All right. All right. All right. Oh, no, no the the disc the metal disc. Okay. Let's go. I'm so excitable today

1050
01:39:56,380 --> 01:39:58,460
You got me in one of those moods. Well, i'm excitable

1051
01:40:00,060 --> 01:40:14,439
Who did that? Uh, it's a secret room this way. There's one more

1052
01:40:15,399 --> 01:40:24,300
and

1053
01:40:24,300 --> 01:40:32,020
Who knows where the hell that is? Let's go back into the town

1054
01:40:32,979 --> 01:40:36,949
Imagine you could run this fast

1055
01:40:40,600 --> 01:40:42,680
Nancy is sprinting around this town

1056
01:40:44,409 --> 01:40:48,010
You know what actually a nice touch would be would you put this game in full letter grade?

1057
01:40:49,050 --> 01:40:51,210
Is if you click really fast like this, she's like

1058
01:40:53,850 --> 01:41:06,250
Let's go back to the pub

1059
01:41:06,250 --> 01:41:07,850
No, there he is. Hello

1060
01:41:07,850 --> 01:41:13,899
What happened with elizabeth what happened with elizabeth? She locked me out of the pub this time for good

1061
01:41:14,380 --> 01:41:19,180
It seems like she was pretty upset by whatever you said to her. That's not your business

1062
01:41:19,500 --> 01:41:23,739
Everyone tries to turn against me in the end gunnar always had gunnar's back

1063
01:41:28,520 --> 01:41:33,399
Holy shit

1064
01:41:33,399 --> 01:41:35,880
Every video game character never changes their clothes

1065
01:41:36,840 --> 01:41:41,159
If they're if you're like an npc in a video game, you don't ever you have the same clothes every time for every game

1066
01:41:51,539 --> 01:41:53,539
Maybe you should try to make up

1067
01:41:54,020 --> 01:42:00,979
No need for that woman no need for anyone anymore that blasted woman won't let me get into this skip again

1068
01:42:01,060 --> 01:42:04,979
His clothes are probably more radioactive than your bathtub a personal box

1069
01:42:05,140 --> 01:42:09,699
I did not get a chance to grab it before guys go walk down into your basement

1070
01:42:09,699 --> 01:42:13,699
If you have one special and take one breath in give you the only clue

1071
01:42:13,859 --> 01:42:17,380
I just consumed probably 5 000 bananas worth of radioactive material

1072
01:42:18,500 --> 01:42:27,699
If you help i'll give you the only clue I have. All right, i'll get the box. I'll get the box

1073
01:42:27,939 --> 01:42:32,659
But I swear if you're lying to me i'm being honest as the day is short

1074
01:42:33,140 --> 01:42:34,260
lancy

1075
01:42:34,260 --> 01:42:36,260
Please talk to you later

1076
01:42:37,619 --> 01:42:46,460
Okay, what does he want?

1077
01:42:48,180 --> 01:42:51,220
This thing oh, it's unlocked already

1078
01:42:54,859 --> 01:42:58,439
Let's open it

1079
01:42:58,439 --> 01:43:01,699
Is that picture of me?

1080
01:43:02,420 --> 01:43:04,420
She looks like me

1081
01:43:04,739 --> 01:43:08,260
Did he just make me go get a box of pictures of me and shit?

1082
01:43:14,699 --> 01:43:16,420
What does it say?

1083
01:43:16,420 --> 01:43:20,100
Police clothes drowning case of two women new. Oh shit. All right, hold on

1084
01:43:30,619 --> 01:43:32,619
Here you can have this

1085
01:43:32,779 --> 01:43:34,779
Did he not know what this was?

1086
01:43:39,130 --> 01:43:41,289
Here, I think this belongs to you

1087
01:43:44,090 --> 01:43:46,090
Thank you

1088
01:43:46,729 --> 01:43:48,729
Did did you open it?

1089
01:43:54,890 --> 01:43:56,409
Yes

1090
01:43:56,409 --> 01:44:02,090
I see it didn't tell me not to open it. I'm ashamed of the way I acted towards super ruse five committee

1091
01:44:02,170 --> 01:44:04,170
I have been angry and blind for too long

1092
01:44:04,810 --> 01:44:09,369
My daughter wouldn't stand for me like this no more of that childishness now

1093
01:44:10,010 --> 01:44:12,010
every day I wake up and

1094
01:44:12,170 --> 01:44:14,890
For one moment. I I think they're still alive

1095
01:44:16,010 --> 01:44:20,569
I reach over to my wife started a bed to hold her and it's all comes back

1096
01:44:21,369 --> 01:44:23,369
And I remember they're gone

1097
01:44:23,850 --> 01:44:25,609
They're both gone

1098
01:44:25,609 --> 01:44:30,409
And I am alone. Oh, he's right. I'm so sorry. Gunnar. It was a long time ago

1099
01:44:31,050 --> 01:44:34,170
I can see now there are still things left to live for

1100
01:44:35,130 --> 01:44:37,289
strong ships good festivals

1101
01:44:38,329 --> 01:44:39,930
new neighbors

1102
01:44:39,930 --> 01:44:46,569
But did he throw bottles at that guy at the cultural center at the misty skip after the tides change

1103
01:44:46,890 --> 01:44:48,890
I'll give you everything I have

1104
01:44:52,439 --> 01:44:54,439
All right, so let's go to bed

1105
01:45:05,460 --> 01:45:12,100
Welcome back. This is for you couldn't wrap my old head around but maybe you can make a head out of a tail

1106
01:45:13,060 --> 01:45:16,710
Oh, there we go

1107
01:45:16,710 --> 01:45:28,460
Hold on i'm texting somebody. I know I now put your phone down put your phone down

1108
01:45:29,260 --> 01:45:31,100
I know I know I know

1109
01:45:31,100 --> 01:45:35,340
I know I know I got my phone during the movie. I'm sorry make good use of it. Fisker

1110
01:45:35,739 --> 01:45:39,739
And don't fucking zoomer. No, i'm sorry. I apologize little lady hands

1111
01:45:41,750 --> 01:45:44,229
All right. Where do you where you saying this is a gear?

1112
01:45:44,949 --> 01:45:49,430
Let me do the puzzle piece first

1113
01:45:53,699 --> 01:45:58,180
I typically don't use my phone for anything

1114
01:45:58,579 --> 01:46:05,619
You can ask the people that call me all the time when I don't answer

1115
01:46:09,100 --> 01:46:11,100
Phones to me are like a pain in the ass

1116
01:46:13,539 --> 01:46:15,880
See back in the day

1117
01:46:15,880 --> 01:46:19,420
Everybody knew that you were not in constant communication

1118
01:46:21,020 --> 01:46:27,340
Now everybody has a cell phone in their pocket. So I know I know you're there. I know that you're getting this right?

1119
01:46:28,520 --> 01:46:30,520
So the 500 iq play

1120
01:46:30,840 --> 01:46:33,640
Is just leave your phone in your bedrooms on your bed

1121
01:46:35,750 --> 01:46:37,829
So then it's just like it was 15 years ago

1122
01:46:41,829 --> 01:46:45,430
Now you're always constantly contactable and what if you just don't want to be contactable

1123
01:46:45,670 --> 01:46:47,670
People know you have your phone because everybody has a phone

1124
01:46:51,829 --> 01:46:54,390
And then they added the shit that they have to read receipts thing

1125
01:46:55,670 --> 01:46:57,430
That's fucked up, too

1126
01:46:57,430 --> 01:47:02,789
What if i'm like out in the grocery store and somebody texts me and I have read receipts on and I look at it

1127
01:47:02,789 --> 01:47:05,510
Oh, no, I have to reply to this person right now

1128
01:47:06,550 --> 01:47:10,920
What if i'm like trying to pick like my favorite hamburger helper and it's taking me 30 minutes

1129
01:47:11,720 --> 01:47:23,539
Now we're gonna go back

1130
01:47:23,939 --> 01:47:32,569
Then problem

1131
01:47:33,130 --> 01:47:37,050
Look I understand like I understand like the cell phones are amazing because they've given us

1132
01:47:37,689 --> 01:47:39,689
a way for emergency

1133
01:47:40,229 --> 01:47:45,130
Contacts and always being in communication and if something, you know, if you're lost, you know, i've got my phone

1134
01:47:45,210 --> 01:47:47,689
I have access to I I have access to the outside world

1135
01:47:53,989 --> 01:47:56,470
All of your stories devolve into anxious paranoia

1136
01:47:57,109 --> 01:48:03,180
I don't this is the same picture

1137
01:48:16,579 --> 01:48:18,579
That's it. I think this is it

1138
01:48:18,899 --> 01:48:20,659
Oh, yeah, that's it

1139
01:48:20,659 --> 01:48:22,659
I've seen this design before

1140
01:48:23,380 --> 01:48:26,819
It's it's from the lighthouse. There must be something there

1141
01:48:27,859 --> 01:48:31,130
All right, we're gonna go to the lighthouse and find the star

1142
01:48:32,899 --> 01:48:36,180
Haven't can't can't check that off yet. Go to the lighthouse

1143
01:48:44,539 --> 01:48:48,250
I thought that was somebody crawling

1144
01:48:50,890 --> 01:49:08,359
Let's go to the lighthouse

1145
01:49:10,039 --> 01:49:12,039
She's the 5g killer

1146
01:49:16,090 --> 01:49:18,090
Don't give me another thing to have nightmares over tonight

1147
01:49:18,409 --> 01:49:35,430
Oh, he's actually scared of 5g

1148
01:49:37,609 --> 01:49:41,930
It's so new the technology is so new. It's so scary sometimes

1149
01:49:44,039 --> 01:49:48,069
Oh, there she is

1150
01:49:50,500 --> 01:49:52,500
Guys it took

1151
01:49:52,899 --> 01:49:54,579
50 years

1152
01:49:54,579 --> 01:49:58,199
For doctors to stop recommending smoking cigarettes

1153
01:49:59,539 --> 01:50:05,300
We've only had wireless technology and cell phone technology for like fucking less than

1154
01:50:05,859 --> 01:50:08,500
10 to 15 years and I have a feeling this is going to be a long one

1155
01:50:08,899 --> 01:50:15,779
I want to believe the best here, but you should stop doing that people like me don't deserve that anyways you me

1156
01:50:16,500 --> 01:50:18,579
town

1157
01:50:18,579 --> 01:50:21,060
So you faked that you'd gone missing, huh?

1158
01:50:21,699 --> 01:50:27,619
Yeah. Yeah, don't look at me with those kicked puppy eyes. I needed some time to crack the case without anyone catching on to me

1159
01:50:28,819 --> 01:50:30,739
All right, we gotta pay attention

1160
01:50:30,739 --> 01:50:32,979
You think that you've gone missing? Yeah. Yeah, don't look at me with those

1161
01:50:33,619 --> 01:50:38,340
Puppy eyes, I needed to crack the case. That's my job. You must have a compelling lead on the treasure

1162
01:50:38,340 --> 01:50:40,340
Otherwise knowing you you'd never have left the heater

1163
01:50:41,779 --> 01:50:46,100
Pretty passive aggressive. Let's pick that one. You must have a compelling lead on the treasure

1164
01:50:46,500 --> 01:50:49,380
Otherwise knowing you you'd never have left the heater

1165
01:50:50,800 --> 01:50:52,420
Detectives

1166
01:50:52,420 --> 01:50:53,539
Okay

1167
01:50:53,539 --> 01:50:57,939
Fine. The ship itself is a map to the treasure. I suspected that

1168
01:50:58,500 --> 01:51:04,020
The problem is the original ship was torn apart many of the pieces of the original have been built into the town

1169
01:51:06,979 --> 01:51:11,939
I need some sort of key something to help me decode the map. All right, i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm going off

1170
01:51:12,100 --> 01:51:14,100
You know where to find that key? Um

1171
01:51:14,819 --> 01:51:19,539
Not even I but you know what I said, I think you do banana

1172
01:51:20,819 --> 01:51:25,060
And a bunch of people in this chat was so concerned about the radiation in a banana

1173
01:51:25,859 --> 01:51:31,380
But 5g I would like stand in front of a 5g frequency wave

1174
01:51:38,069 --> 01:51:41,350
Dude 5g is just it's like nothing. Don't worry. Don't eat bananas though

1175
01:51:41,350 --> 01:51:46,310
This is like this like point zero point zero zero zero zero zero zero zero one percent. Uh, fucking radiation in that soil that it was in

1176
01:51:47,449 --> 01:51:49,130
Sorry, I don't

1177
01:51:49,130 --> 01:51:52,489
Hmm a girl with principles. That's cute

1178
01:51:54,949 --> 01:51:56,949
5g is one one thousandth of a banana

1179
01:52:04,489 --> 01:52:15,539
Haha

1180
01:52:15,539 --> 01:52:18,819
If you eat a banana near a 5g tower, you're going to die

1181
01:52:21,510 --> 01:52:27,670
I don't want to believe you'd do something to magnus, but you're not giving me a lot of options here. Look i'm being honest

1182
01:52:28,229 --> 01:52:31,189
take this as collateral it clearly fits somewhere just

1183
01:52:32,149 --> 01:52:38,789
Not sure where I might be greedy, but i'm not a greedy kidnapper. I want magnus back safe or at least safe

1184
01:52:39,029 --> 01:52:41,029
I'm not a greedy grinner

1185
01:52:41,430 --> 01:52:48,949
By the way greedy grinner is one of the nominees along with uh shito clowns and um

1186
01:52:49,750 --> 01:52:51,350
shannon sharon

1187
01:52:51,350 --> 01:52:54,630
And the rumor for best character new character of the year, by the way

1188
01:52:54,630 --> 01:52:58,229
If you haven't voted yet, there is a way to vote for your favorites of the year

1189
01:52:59,670 --> 01:53:01,670
New year's eve stream. The poll is now live

1190
01:53:02,310 --> 01:53:04,840
There it is

1191
01:53:04,840 --> 01:53:10,310
Take a look

1192
01:53:10,310 --> 01:53:14,390
Maybe that'll help you if you decide to stop hating money. I'll be waiting

1193
01:53:15,029 --> 01:53:18,020
toodles

1194
01:53:18,020 --> 01:53:22,340
All right, so I have this lion token. What's that for though? Can't that's done?

1195
01:53:23,380 --> 01:53:27,859
Can't check can't check that off yet follow up on that. Okay, all right. I gotta go back to the uh tower

1196
01:53:28,420 --> 01:53:36,810
Now i'm not giving my opinion on any of the nominees

1197
01:53:37,210 --> 01:53:39,449
I don't want to sway anything

1198
01:53:39,529 --> 01:53:46,250
positive or negative

1199
01:53:54,260 --> 01:54:00,500
Not happening. I think it's time to find out what elizabeth's hiding in that deck closet. Didn't I already go in this closet?

1200
01:54:03,189 --> 01:54:04,949
I have nothing for you

1201
01:54:04,949 --> 01:54:12,170
I already went in here

1202
01:54:12,250 --> 01:54:18,970
Nancy stop don't go in there. Sorry elizabeth, but it's time to come clean. I know you're hiding someone in there

1203
01:54:19,210 --> 01:54:21,510
No, you can't

1204
01:54:23,699 --> 01:54:25,699
There actually is a person here

1205
01:54:36,890 --> 01:54:45,100
Why did you put a dog in there so much for finding magnus I guess you thought I was hiding magnus

1206
01:54:47,739 --> 01:54:49,739
It was really suspicious

1207
01:54:50,539 --> 01:54:52,539
Sorry, I pinned you wrong though

1208
01:54:53,020 --> 01:54:53,979
I

1209
01:54:53,979 --> 01:54:55,979
Guess it was a little strange

1210
01:54:56,300 --> 01:54:58,300
So I have to ask the obvious

1211
01:54:58,779 --> 01:55:01,579
Why are you keeping a dog in a closet?

1212
01:55:02,220 --> 01:55:06,539
Tumi wouldn't do well in a shelter. He seems to really like so he would do better in a

1213
01:55:07,340 --> 01:55:10,220
Three by three closet. I want to hate him so much

1214
01:55:10,779 --> 01:55:12,699
But I just can't

1215
01:55:12,699 --> 01:55:17,340
When did you manage to get to me just before magnus left to take the ship into harbor?

1216
01:55:17,899 --> 01:55:22,859
That's why I wasn't at the festival hang on so you knew magnus was going to go missing

1217
01:55:23,020 --> 01:55:28,539
No, but I knew he'd notice if to me did and then maybe he'd have to come looking for me for once

1218
01:55:30,380 --> 01:55:31,579
Yeah, yeah, okay

1219
01:55:31,579 --> 01:55:37,739
Uh, this is not elizabeth pet napping may not be a healthy way to handle this. I agree

1220
01:55:38,380 --> 01:55:40,220
It started off as that

1221
01:55:40,220 --> 01:55:45,899
But now that he's missing I feel like it's smarter to keep to me here if someone did abduct magnus

1222
01:55:46,220 --> 01:55:48,699
How long would to me spend in the cage at the borders?

1223
01:55:49,420 --> 01:55:53,340
Listen nancy just a little while ago. I realized something

1224
01:55:53,899 --> 01:55:58,699
When you told me my family's song I'm not paying attention because it is a love song

1225
01:55:59,260 --> 01:56:01,340
It's a love song for my family's heritage

1226
01:56:02,060 --> 01:56:04,060
the treasure

1227
01:56:04,140 --> 01:56:10,619
So the purpose of the song was to make sure only captain laurence's descendant could find that treasure here

1228
01:56:11,579 --> 01:56:19,180
Have this oh i've never shown music box. Maybe they've been the key all along I trust you to find out the truth nancy

1229
01:56:20,869 --> 01:56:25,350
Okay, bring magnus home bring magnus home. All right. Goodbye elizabeth

1230
01:56:27,109 --> 01:56:31,430
I'll see you when you return home to whatever fucking sims expansion you came from

1231
01:56:32,069 --> 01:56:36,979
All right back to the cabin

1232
01:56:36,979 --> 01:56:41,640
Talk to the dog

1233
01:56:41,640 --> 01:56:45,369
I can't you can't talk to the dog. No dog can't talk to dog

1234
01:56:47,739 --> 01:56:51,100
I gotta go I gotta go to the yeah the cabin

1235
01:57:03,859 --> 01:57:06,100
Music box

1236
01:57:06,180 --> 01:57:08,579
Here we go. All right stick it in there

1237
01:57:09,699 --> 01:57:14,659
This belongs to elizabeth's family and her song is a missing piece

1238
01:57:15,140 --> 01:57:18,020
I wonder if I can arrange these teeth to play that song

1239
01:57:19,699 --> 01:57:24,630
Fuck arrange the I don't know what this means

1240
01:57:25,350 --> 01:57:27,109
I don't make music

1241
01:57:27,109 --> 01:57:30,039
I'm gonna say i'm just gonna go for it. Let's uh

1242
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:33,500
What is

1243
01:57:45,050 --> 01:57:47,689
Uh, let's try um

1244
01:57:48,569 --> 01:57:54,199
Uh, and then two in a row so it's

1245
01:57:56,279 --> 01:57:57,399
Like that

1246
01:57:57,399 --> 01:57:59,399
No, there's gotta be the same size

1247
01:57:59,479 --> 01:58:03,319
Are they all the and none of these the same size?

1248
01:58:03,960 --> 01:58:18,899
They're all different sizes

1249
01:58:18,899 --> 01:58:22,710
Damn it. I can't read. I of course. I can't read music

1250
01:58:26,600 --> 01:58:30,359
In order of height. Yeah, but aren't those two notes the same on the same line?

1251
01:58:30,920 --> 01:58:32,920
So wouldn't it be the same size?

1252
01:58:38,279 --> 01:58:53,130
Or am I am I overthinking this?

1253
01:58:53,210 --> 01:58:56,739
You're under thinking it

1254
01:58:56,739 --> 01:58:58,739
Yeah, it goes low

1255
01:59:01,699 --> 01:59:02,899
So

1256
01:59:02,899 --> 01:59:08,789
Just do shortest to longest

1257
01:59:09,750 --> 01:59:17,239
I I don't think that I don't think that's accurate. It's not shortest to longest

1258
01:59:20,090 --> 01:59:21,770
Is it?

1259
01:59:21,770 --> 01:59:36,090
I thought it would have to be

1260
01:59:36,729 --> 01:59:44,579
It's still going

1261
01:59:44,579 --> 01:59:48,579
Sorting algorithm. I don't think that was correct

1262
01:59:49,640 --> 01:59:56,340
lion

1263
01:59:56,340 --> 01:59:58,140
Um

1264
01:59:58,140 --> 02:00:00,220
The notes change. Yeah, why do the notes change?

1265
02:00:07,899 --> 02:00:09,899
Watch the dots

1266
02:00:22,810 --> 02:00:48,970
The game lagged for a second scrolling down in the walkthrough no i'm not i'm not

1267
02:00:49,210 --> 02:00:56,630
What

1268
02:01:01,079 --> 02:01:03,319
Fuck you. Yes, you are. Hey easy

1269
02:01:04,439 --> 02:01:12,899
Don't swear at me

1270
02:01:12,899 --> 02:01:14,899
harry potter

1271
02:01:21,180 --> 02:01:23,180
Oh

1272
02:01:26,380 --> 02:01:28,380
Can I actually get it to do that

1273
02:01:40,979 --> 02:01:43,609
This needs to be higher

1274
02:02:06,310 --> 02:02:11,300
This is be lower

1275
02:02:19,930 --> 02:02:24,729
I almost had it. Sorry. All right, let's see. What do I want to move? I want to move these guys gotta start like this

1276
02:02:25,770 --> 02:02:30,010
Big ones gotta be in the middle. I know that for a fact. I just do how do I know that you ask

1277
02:02:30,729 --> 02:02:34,619
I took two music classes another that we this is the crescendo. That's what that's called

1278
02:02:40,619 --> 02:02:58,859
Let's try that

1279
02:02:58,939 --> 02:03:12,329
Just try every combination longer bars make lower notes. Yep

1280
02:03:13,289 --> 02:03:23,399
This is just what happens when somebody tries to phonetically play jingle bells on a piano

1281
02:03:25,300 --> 02:03:28,500
Even if you get it wrong, you're getting the the timings, right?

1282
02:04:00,390 --> 02:04:14,649
Try that

1283
02:05:00,859 --> 02:05:11,029
Somebody said how are you this bad? I just did it

1284
02:05:13,939 --> 02:05:17,859
Tone depth. Oh my god. He's so stupid tough. I'll take my fish, please

1285
02:05:18,260 --> 02:05:20,899
I like this one. Why do I let me look at this a little bit more

1286
02:05:26,100 --> 02:05:28,329
nice

1287
02:05:28,329 --> 02:05:33,770
My i'm my i'm my eyes are ripping over the chat. It's cool. What what is that? Cool. What's that limit image?

1288
02:05:34,329 --> 02:05:35,289
Nice

1289
02:05:35,289 --> 02:05:39,029
All right. I gotta stop. Let's get back to the game. What's this?

1290
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:44,359
Oh, that's like a little fish. It's like a like a little gummy fish. That's so cool

1291
02:05:45,079 --> 02:05:49,750
I just want to look at it for a minute

1292
02:05:49,750 --> 02:05:53,850
Cool. All right. What is this?

1293
02:05:57,079 --> 02:06:00,359
Part of a note or a book we succeeded we fought we captured the

1294
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:03,000
Here lifcahede, okay

1295
02:06:03,880 --> 02:06:05,880
All right. So now I got the fish

1296
02:06:06,199 --> 02:06:12,340
Track down the treasure's location can't have check. Okay, there's that

1297
02:06:15,180 --> 02:06:17,180
I want fish gummy

1298
02:06:17,260 --> 02:06:21,420
I want fish gummy. I want fish gummy. You'll you'll relax. You're fine

1299
02:06:22,979 --> 02:06:24,100
relax

1300
02:06:24,100 --> 02:06:28,970
Cheating like this is why germa died to pinwheel

1301
02:06:29,689 --> 02:06:48,430
What's going on change obs to all screens to prove no guide

1302
02:06:49,789 --> 02:06:54,750
You know how easy it would be for me just to close the tab that has the walkthrough in it

1303
02:06:55,630 --> 02:06:58,750
Very easy

1304
02:06:58,750 --> 02:07:00,520
Oh shit, you got me

1305
02:07:00,520 --> 02:07:25,609
Uh, oh no. All right. Let's go. What's what's this fish wooden tile in token? Let's go back to the uh

1306
02:07:28,010 --> 02:07:33,500
I want to go back to that wall

1307
02:07:33,659 --> 02:07:35,659
Can you order me blueberries?

1308
02:07:38,109 --> 02:07:41,390
Now, how about you tell me what you want and I will order uber eats

1309
02:07:42,539 --> 02:07:46,140
And then i'll just eat the food that you were going to eat and i'll leave it on stream for you

1310
02:07:46,539 --> 02:07:49,579
And then you can just take the bites like mimic while i'm biting and be like

1311
02:07:54,909 --> 02:08:01,819
All right. Um, where was that?

1312
02:08:03,100 --> 02:08:08,539
All right, I gotta go back to the ship

1313
02:08:08,539 --> 02:08:13,789
Uh-oh ship alarm

1314
02:08:23,369 --> 02:08:25,149
What

1315
02:08:25,149 --> 02:08:29,069
Okay, the clues laurence left behind have confirmed that the treasure is not on the ship

1316
02:08:31,689 --> 02:08:36,890
He evidently suspected that the town would eventually turn against him and started to hide the treasure elsewhere at

1317
02:08:37,529 --> 02:08:40,890
this place i've been able to recreate the first steps and clearly

1318
02:08:41,770 --> 02:08:47,369
The caves run deeper than we realized there must be more pages from laurence's journal that will reveal the final steps to take

1319
02:08:48,010 --> 02:08:50,010
enter the caves, oh

1320
02:08:50,729 --> 02:08:54,649
Turn right at the red pumice stones walk forward to all right

1321

02:09:31,359 --> 02:09:33,359
Now i'm not gonna say spoilers

1325
02:09:41,529 --> 02:09:44,810
Okay. Well now I know so I'll track down the treasure

1326
02:09:45,850 --> 02:09:47,689
So we have to go to the cave

1327
02:09:47,689 --> 02:09:50,460
I gotta read this red stones

1328
02:09:52,810 --> 02:09:56,840
This would be a cool little adventure

1329
02:09:56,920 --> 02:10:07,479
All right, that's wrong. I want the location

1330
02:10:08,359 --> 02:10:11,000
Under the caves turn right at the red pumice stone

1331
02:10:11,720 --> 02:10:13,310
There it is

1332
02:10:13,310 --> 02:10:16,170
right

1333
02:10:16,170 --> 02:10:18,890
Walk forward to the high ledge with red stone

1334
02:10:19,609 --> 02:10:32,590
Okay climbing up and over then down past the yellow pumice stones

1335
02:10:33,390 --> 02:10:36,140
Okay

1336
02:10:36,140 --> 02:10:42,699
Continue forward till the tunnel splits levels go up

1337
02:10:43,579 --> 02:11:05,479
Okay, turn right at the cluster of five stalagmites and continue forward to a large cavern

1338
02:11:06,279 --> 02:11:39,310
Okay, wait, didn't I already get this? Is it the egg? I already did this turn right

1339
02:11:55,180 --> 02:11:57,039
Go up

No, stalagmites are one two three four. Okay, turn right

1344
02:12:14,430 --> 02:12:16,729
That's what I just did

1345
02:12:17,930 --> 02:12:27,880
And continue forward to a large cavern doesn't let I can't go forward there it is

1346
02:12:28,439 --> 02:12:44,250
I already picked up the shit that was down here. Didn't I?

1347
02:12:51,979 --> 02:12:53,979
Ice pick. No, that's not doing anything

1348
02:13:05,210 --> 02:13:07,710
Is the egg?

1349
02:13:07,710 --> 02:13:31,149
Okay, let's go. I'm going to the guide. What's the guide say? Okay track down the treasure

1350
02:13:32,359 --> 02:13:35,880
Yeah head into the right tunnel

02:13:36,779 --> 02:13:39,260
Continue two steps use the hook on the wall

1352
02:13:39,899 --> 02:13:52,909
Isn't that what I did?

1353
02:13:52,909 --> 02:13:54,909
That's what i'm doing

1354
02:13:54,909 --> 02:13:56,189
Wrong wall

1355
02:13:56,189 --> 02:14:14,539
Okay, i'm in the cavern

1356
02:14:14,539 --> 02:14:32,079
Go wrong hook

1357
02:14:34,329 --> 02:14:36,329
What's the right hook?

1358
02:14:36,329 --> 02:14:37,289
What?

1359
02:14:37,289 --> 02:14:52,909
What do you mean wrong hook?

1360
02:14:52,909 --> 02:14:57,229
Give me back to square one. Give me back to square one back to square one. This this doesn't do anything

1361
02:14:59,289 --> 02:15:00,729
Back to square one

1362
02:15:00,729 --> 02:15:04,720
Just give me back out back up back up back up back up put this away

1364
02:15:16,560 --> 02:15:18,329
Turn around

1365
02:15:18,329 --> 02:15:20,760
Go up here we go

1366
02:15:20,760 --> 02:15:22,760
All right. Wait a minute. Okay turn

1367
02:15:23,079 --> 02:15:26,189
stalagmites

1368
02:15:26,189 --> 02:15:28,670
stalagmites

1369
02:15:28,670 --> 02:15:30,670
Continue forward to a large cavern

1370
02:15:32,090 --> 02:15:34,090
Left and right it separates

1371
02:15:34,170 --> 02:15:36,170
Head to the right the right tunnel

1372
02:15:43,069 --> 02:15:45,630
Go forward twice

1373
02:15:45,630 --> 02:15:48,699
Use the pick on the wall

1374
02:15:48,699 --> 02:15:55,199
Use the hook on the wall

1375
02:15:55,199 --> 02:15:58,960
I can't do this yet. That's the problem. I can't smash this wall

1376
02:15:59,680 --> 02:16:04,000
Because I haven't read the note about how I should smash the fucking wall

1377
02:16:14,329 --> 02:16:22,409
I'm not too good. I better have saved before that

1378
02:16:22,970 --> 02:16:26,880
That better have saved

1379
02:16:26,880 --> 02:16:30,329
Thank god

1380
02:16:30,329 --> 02:16:34,090
All right, get me the fuck out of here. Get me out of here. Get me I gotta go read like I could do something else

1381
02:16:34,090 --> 02:16:45,760
And read a note

1382
02:16:45,760 --> 02:16:49,440
All right. What do I what do I have? I have some stuff. I have to go back

1383
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:56,840
To where where should I go?

1384
02:16:57,479 --> 02:17:01,260
This is what happens when you cheat with the drew crew

1385
02:17:02,079 --> 02:17:07,840
No, everything's fine. I know what I have to do. I know what I have to do. Check it out

1386
02:17:23,979 --> 02:17:25,579
Check this out

1387
02:17:25,579 --> 02:17:29,180
That's a lion token token to rotate these it's a clinko machine

1388
02:17:31,819 --> 02:17:35,850
Oh, this is actually kind of fun. All right

1389
02:17:49,959 --> 02:17:52,489
Reset it

1390
02:17:52,489 --> 02:17:55,770
They're all flipped. So it goes down straight first

1391
02:17:56,409 --> 02:18:00,120
Does it bounce over here? No, it doesn't

1392
02:18:00,120 --> 02:18:03,639
So it goes and alternates

1393
02:18:05,079 --> 02:18:07,959
No, it doesn't because it goes down straight doesn't it? I thought it did

1394
02:18:10,909 --> 02:18:14,510
What do we want drew crew that's here right now you get the drew crew's right here

1395
02:18:15,469 --> 02:18:19,709
All right, there we go

02:18:19,709 --> 02:18:21,709
All right. It's so damn close. I just have to

1397
02:18:22,430 --> 02:18:28,319

What was that boy that was left? Hold on. What's this? What i'm going to die? I just did it

1401
02:19:27,850 --> 02:19:30,489
I fucked it up. I'm just a little guy. I had it right

1402
02:19:33,440 --> 02:19:35,440
banana 5g brain

1403
02:19:37,440 --> 02:19:40,319
I literally just did it. All right. What's the guide say who cares?

1404
02:19:40,959 --> 02:19:42,719
I need to find I

1405
02:19:42,719 --> 02:19:46,190
He wasted so many lion coins

1406
02:19:51,440 --> 02:19:54,719
No, I had it. Okay, at least then go down here. That's done

1407
02:19:55,520 --> 02:20:06,409
Does it?

1408
02:20:06,409 --> 02:20:09,100
Didn't even need to cheat. I didn't even have to cheat on that one

1409
02:20:11,309 --> 02:20:23,290
final gear

1410
02:20:23,290 --> 02:20:25,290
I gotta go back to

1411
02:20:26,600 --> 02:20:28,600
All right. Now I have all the gears

1412
02:20:29,690 --> 02:20:32,159
It's time

1413
02:20:32,159 --> 02:20:41,319
Wait, that's on the boat. It's in the secret room

1414
02:20:44,430 --> 02:20:49,420
Head down here open that up back to the secret room

1415
02:20:50,700 --> 02:20:53,020
All right, get it on there done

1416
02:20:53,819 --> 02:20:57,079
What is behind here

1417
02:21:03,639 --> 02:21:07,239
This looks ancient. It's a pretty long game for a shitty dollar bin game

1418
02:21:07,319 --> 02:21:09,319
Yeah, I played it for like six hours last time too

1419
02:21:10,440 --> 02:21:13,879
I need to get this sliding shape over to that treasure marking

1420
02:21:15,790 --> 02:21:17,790
What in the name of god is this?

1421
02:21:17,950 --> 02:21:26,399
Move the sliding shape to the yellow treasure mark using your mouse or keyboard arrows

1422
02:21:28,319 --> 02:21:37,120
They did this shit in zoom beanies and it was horrible

1423
02:21:37,120 --> 02:21:39,120
Oh

1424
02:21:39,200 --> 02:21:43,069
So I have to be a red fish to go over there

1425
02:21:44,030 --> 02:21:51,149
Okay, hold on. Can I get to be a turtle?

1426
02:21:52,430 --> 02:21:54,670
Okay, I need to be red

Done, okay. Where's where?

1471
02:27:05,440 --> 02:27:09,889
Now I might need to flip this around I might need to switch it

1472
02:27:15,969 --> 02:27:20,209
Turn the sound down. Is it? Oh, is the sound really loud? Oh shit. I'm sorry

1473
02:27:22,129 --> 02:27:24,129
All right, so we're gonna do

1474
02:27:30,590 --> 02:27:35,680
Wait, what how could it be? How are there three of these?

1475
02:27:37,149 --> 02:27:43,569
Uh, wait, i'm confused. How would there be three of these? Oh it needs to be covered. Okay. Um

1476
02:27:43,569 --> 02:27:44,850
Um

1477
02:27:44,850 --> 02:27:56,049
What's this what's this coffee pasta?

1478
02:27:56,129 --> 02:28:01,819
There's a bunch of emotes and shit

1479
02:28:04,350 --> 02:28:08,670
All right, get that get that out of here get that out of here. All right, I can't read it

1480
02:28:09,629 --> 02:28:13,659
Okay, uh now we need um

1481
02:28:14,379 --> 02:28:15,840
This one

1482
02:28:15,840 --> 02:28:20,159
And then this one is that correct? We'll find out that's not correct

1483
02:28:21,040 --> 02:28:22,319
This has to be

1484
02:28:22,319 --> 02:28:24,319
Wait, what's underneath that? Yes

1485
02:28:25,899 --> 02:28:26,860
Um

1486
02:28:26,860 --> 02:28:32,459
Okay, what about down here?

1487
02:28:32,540 --> 02:28:48,209
Empty all right. I I get it. Oh fuck this is wrong. Uh

1488
02:28:50,209 --> 02:29:02,239
I don't know. It's going well. Uh kind of

1489
02:29:03,600 --> 02:29:05,600
All right, that needs to be covered. So what if I go like this?

1490
02:29:08,180 --> 02:29:10,579
and then here and then

1491
02:29:12,219 --> 02:29:14,219
That noise really is fucking hurting me

1492
02:29:15,100 --> 02:29:19,540
That's the last one

1493
02:29:19,540 --> 02:29:22,510
All right

1494
02:29:22,510 --> 02:29:24,670
So far it's working kind of

1495
02:29:26,020 --> 02:29:29,090
This puzzle is easy

1496
02:29:29,090 --> 02:29:34,340
Maybe for you

1497
02:29:34,340 --> 02:29:36,659
Let's just start putting shit in here and we can fix it later

1498
02:29:38,690 --> 02:29:40,610
This is still correct

1499
02:29:40,610 --> 02:29:41,889
correct

1500
02:29:41,889 --> 02:29:48,450
Why can I put that here?

1501
02:29:48,450 --> 02:29:50,450
Oh, no, I have to cover that

1502
02:29:50,450 --> 02:29:54,579
Uh-oh

1503
02:29:54,579 --> 02:30:06,540
um

1504
02:30:08,139 --> 02:30:10,139
Okay

1505
02:30:11,809 --> 02:30:21,200
Life is pain. It kind of is at the moment. This has to be a

1506
02:30:22,479 --> 02:30:25,680
This has to be this this has to be correct. So this is wrong

1507
02:30:27,569 --> 02:30:29,250
This is also wrong

1508
02:30:29,329 --> 02:30:41,940
Wait, that's wrong. Holy shit. This sucks

1509
02:30:43,700 --> 02:30:45,010
uh

1510
02:30:45,010 --> 02:30:48,290
Mods please slow mode or sub only or something. Please make it stop

1511
02:30:49,170 --> 02:31:00,530
I just like seeing purple in chat. Yeah, I still have to figure out what i'm gonna do with that stuff

1512
02:31:01,729 --> 02:31:03,729
All right. Everything's been covered

1513
02:31:06,399 --> 02:31:12,219
This is not right. Okay, I still need one of these

1514
02:31:13,420 --> 02:31:16,500
Is that done? No, what's wrong with this?

1515
02:31:16,979 --> 02:31:24,139
Okay, wait

1516
02:31:24,139 --> 02:31:26,139
Now hold on

1517
02:31:26,780 --> 02:31:29,979
That has to be covered there

1518
02:31:29,979 --> 02:31:31,100
uh

1519
02:31:31,100 --> 02:31:34,899
What am I missing this doesn't even have one of these

1520
02:31:38,700 --> 02:31:48,659
He hates us. What are you talking about? You still have 9 000 points. Well, I would save them because

1521
02:31:50,020 --> 02:31:53,540
Uh for like 50 000 points, you'll be able to like turn my camera on or something

1522
02:31:54,180 --> 02:31:58,299
All right. What's this last one has to be this right?

1523
02:31:59,100 --> 02:32:04,030
good

1524
02:32:04,030 --> 02:32:06,030
Is this this is still correct?

1525
02:32:06,719 --> 02:32:08,659
All right

1526
02:32:08,659 --> 02:32:12,620
Hold on. It's almost ready

1527
02:32:12,620 --> 02:32:13,739
uh

1528
02:32:13,739 --> 02:32:18,420
here

1529
02:32:18,420 --> 02:32:21,489
Yeah

1530
02:32:21,489 --> 02:32:23,489
Uh, this is wrong

1531
02:32:25,870 --> 02:32:32,780
Um, it's so close though

1532
02:32:44,770 --> 02:32:46,819
shit

1533
02:32:46,819 --> 02:32:49,780
What needs to change this has too many of these?

1534
02:32:50,500 --> 02:32:53,250
Okay, okay

1535
02:32:53,809 --> 02:32:54,770
Oh

1536
02:32:54,770 --> 02:32:56,850
I didn't cheat. I swear to god. I didn't cheat. I promise

1537
02:32:57,250 --> 02:33:06,530
Open the chest in the hold

1538
02:33:07,170 --> 02:33:11,260
Oh shit, there's like a skeleton back here

1539
02:33:12,139 --> 02:33:13,739
That's done

1540
02:33:13,739 --> 02:33:19,100
Catch that's done. All right track down the treasure follow the up on the image created by the sketches

1541
02:33:19,100 --> 02:33:28,579
I have to go back to the lighthouse

1542
02:33:28,579 --> 02:33:32,610
Who do you guys think did it?

1543
02:33:32,610 --> 02:33:35,010
I can't wait till we find out who did it. It's like

1544
02:33:36,260 --> 02:33:38,260
Who did it? Here's the big reveal

1545
02:33:38,739 --> 02:33:40,739
We walk up to the person that we think it is

1546
02:33:41,620 --> 02:33:43,620
and then you hear

1547
02:33:43,620 --> 02:33:46,420
You look down like a bloody knife dropped out of my fucking shirt

1548
02:33:48,479 --> 02:33:53,200
And then the camera changes to dagny's perspective and you start controlling dagny and it was me

1549
02:33:55,069 --> 02:33:56,430
That'd be pretty cool

1550
02:33:56,430 --> 02:34:01,069
Because a game I need a game i'm gonna make a game that does that spoiler alert for my future game

1551
02:34:01,629 --> 02:34:03,629
Sorry, you'll know what happens

1552
02:34:03,950 --> 02:34:13,389
Did you know that dogs can have a little salami? We already went over that

1553
02:34:15,389 --> 02:34:17,549
You're like an hour and 12 minutes late. Sorry

1554
02:34:22,209 --> 02:34:28,219
So where's the star?

1555
02:34:28,219 --> 02:34:30,219
right there

1556
02:34:38,860 --> 02:34:40,540
There's more

1557
02:34:40,540 --> 02:34:43,500
There are more puzzles in the world than than

1558
02:34:44,139 --> 02:34:47,819
Match numbers and have the sums of the numbers be next to each other. There's more

1559
02:34:48,780 --> 02:34:50,780
Puzzles than this that exists

1560
02:34:51,420 --> 02:34:57,840
Do I don't have to why is it because I have to be like this

1561
02:35:01,629 --> 02:35:03,790
This is just 700 000 games

1562
02:35:04,959 --> 02:35:10,559
All right, place the number so that one of each number is within each outlined large triangle

1563
02:35:11,200 --> 02:35:23,229
oh, man, okay, I

1564
02:35:23,309 --> 02:35:33,180
horizon

1565
02:35:33,180 --> 02:35:35,180
That each number has to be in each

1566
02:35:35,819 --> 02:35:37,979
It's it's just so it's it's sudoku

1567
02:35:41,659 --> 02:35:45,579
Yeah, I never played sudoku. I was a pick. Why can't they be pick ross?

1568
02:35:46,219 --> 02:35:48,819
Are you shitting me?

1569
02:35:48,819 --> 02:35:52,100
Look at these images and you tell me that these images were not made for pick ross

1570
02:35:52,819 --> 02:35:56,020
Why would you have another math logic place the tile one?

1571
02:36:00,450 --> 02:36:02,450
The true the drew crew lives for this

1572
02:36:08,399 --> 02:36:12,959
All right, let's go in a row. I said we have uh, eight six. We need uh, there's two in there

1573
02:36:12,959 --> 02:36:14,959
It was a three. There's no three in there

1574
02:36:15,280 --> 02:36:21,040
Uh, where's the four? There's no four in there. There is is there a five? No, there's no five. Is there a seven?

1575
02:36:21,040 --> 02:36:24,979
There's no seven

1576
02:36:25,059 --> 02:36:28,340
Okay, so two three four five six seven eight nine

1577
02:36:30,399 --> 02:36:32,399
uh seven five seven

1578
02:36:33,440 --> 02:36:34,420
What?

1579
02:36:34,420 --> 02:36:45,149
But this should be horizontal horizontal row and that I thought this is

1580
02:36:47,250 --> 02:36:48,450
Is that okay?

1581
02:36:48,450 --> 02:36:54,719
I don't know. So I didn't have played sort of

1582
02:36:59,020 --> 02:37:01,020
diagonals, you know, it has

1583
02:37:01,280 --> 02:37:04,659
Oh for the love of god has to be fucking diagonals

1584
02:37:11,440 --> 02:37:14,100
I'm using my lifeline

1585
02:37:14,100 --> 02:37:16,459
the lifeline is

1586
02:37:16,540 --> 02:37:17,500
uh

1587
02:37:17,500 --> 02:37:19,389
phone

1588
02:37:19,389 --> 02:37:21,629
Gamer boomers game boomers.com

1589
02:37:22,780 --> 02:37:37,889
And phone friend. All right, let's see what they say. He's cheating already. No, I don't want to do this

1590
02:37:38,530 --> 02:37:42,370
No, that's I don't like this one. I don't like that too many of these too many of these

1591
02:37:46,139 --> 02:37:51,500
Too many of these i'm sorry. I just you got you got to just call it like it is too many of these

1592
02:38:03,180 --> 02:38:05,899
Cheating not allowed that wasn't part of the deal

1593
02:38:06,620 --> 02:38:10,590
Don't you do we don't you want to see who did it?

1594
02:38:11,680 --> 02:38:14,000
He used game boomers last stream of this game

1595
02:38:14,959 --> 02:38:16,940
That's so funny that

1596
02:38:16,940 --> 02:38:21,120
This 38 or 37 nancy drew walkthroughs

1597
02:38:21,979 --> 02:38:24,299
on the game boomers dot com

1598
02:38:25,920 --> 02:38:27,860
that's so

1599
02:38:27,860 --> 02:38:29,860
Just so appropriate

1600
02:38:36,530 --> 02:38:39,790
Don't worry. I'm solving it

1601
02:38:39,790 --> 02:38:43,069
It's going to be so cool when you see the the actual solution

1602
02:38:45,649 --> 02:38:47,969
When there's too many numbers on the screen, I can't my brain hurts

1603
02:38:48,690 --> 02:38:53,780
like I want to like open up the container and find the key and like look under the desk and press the button and

1604
02:38:54,340 --> 02:38:59,139
Pull out the tray and and match and sort. I don't want to do math. I'm sick of math

1605
02:39:09,299 --> 02:39:17,680
Oh, so by the way, uh, I want to bring this up because it's something we're doing probably fairly soon early into 2020

1606
02:39:18,319 --> 02:39:20,319
We're gonna do an ipad stream

1607
02:39:20,719 --> 02:39:23,600
There are a shitload of games that have come out on the ipad

1608
02:39:24,239 --> 02:39:25,899
some of them just seem

1609
02:39:25,899 --> 02:39:28,559
Absolutely outrageous that we have to play them

1610
02:39:29,280 --> 02:39:35,409
I've been saving them. Some of them have come out some of them. I've been some of them are ad games

1611
02:39:36,209 --> 02:39:39,329
And what an ad game is it's a game that I was playing. I was playing a different game

1612
02:39:40,049 --> 02:39:41,090
and then

1613
02:39:41,090 --> 02:39:44,450
A 30 second take over the whole ipad a ad came up

1614
02:39:45,540 --> 02:39:47,540
And it was this game that I have downloaded now

1615
02:39:49,299 --> 02:39:57,629
Uh, it should be interesting a lot of them are ad games. So i'm probably gonna have to like wipe my ipad to factory settings

1616
02:39:59,649 --> 02:40:01,819
After doing this stream

1617
02:40:01,819 --> 02:40:12,829
Why i'm gonna have to this puzzle isn't hard. No, I know i'm doing it. I'm doing it

1618
02:40:13,549 --> 02:40:18,030
I just have a game boomer in my corner in case I have trouble

1619
02:40:26,030 --> 02:40:30,700
Malware, yeah, you gotta be careful with those games

1620
02:40:39,680 --> 02:40:41,680
My brother used to do these all the time

1621
02:40:41,840 --> 02:40:44,420
He used to try to show me

1622
02:40:44,420 --> 02:40:46,020
how it worked

1623
02:40:46,020 --> 02:40:51,620
And I would always get halfway through his first sentence before I trailed off

1624
02:40:52,739 --> 02:40:54,739
And don't know what he was talking about

1625
02:40:55,139 --> 02:41:01,969
Got it

1626
02:41:01,969 --> 02:41:09,229
Got it the final piece head into the tunnel continue forward two steps then turn left and take one step forward buried in the cave

1627
02:41:09,309 --> 02:41:11,309
Wall to your left be a chest

1628
02:41:11,309 --> 02:41:17,950
Containing a paltry sum should you be followed or forced by the town's treachery simply reveal the decoy chest

1629
02:41:18,670 --> 02:41:22,350
The true treasure lies beyond that retrace your steps to the decoys treasure location

1630
02:41:22,350 --> 02:41:26,430
You'll find another passage leading up from there follow it now recall the words i've sung to you many times

1631
02:41:26,989 --> 02:41:30,909
Press the images in the order they appear from start to end with those words as your guiding light

1632
02:41:36,459 --> 02:41:43,069
Let's go

1633
02:41:43,069 --> 02:41:44,750
Follow the instructions

1634
02:41:44,750 --> 02:41:55,020
And that was just oh, yeah, that's the cat. I don't know why that sounded like unzipped pants

1635
02:41:56,219 --> 02:42:00,260
Or zip up jacket

1636
02:42:00,260 --> 02:42:02,899
That was like zip up pants unzip jacket

1637
02:42:03,620 --> 02:42:05,059
It was one of those

1638
02:42:05,059 --> 02:42:15,120
Here we go. All right. Let's get where's the note

1639
02:42:18,829 --> 02:42:21,229
It was actually I think I remember how to get there

1640
02:42:22,370 --> 02:42:25,329
Yeah, you're just gonna go forward forward people said what about that hand?

1641
02:42:26,940 --> 02:42:28,620
Yeah, i've looked at it already

1642
02:42:28,620 --> 02:42:33,860
It's the guy's glove

1643
02:42:33,860 --> 02:42:35,299
All right. Here we go

1644
02:42:35,299 --> 02:42:37,299
Just gonna make it down go up

1645
02:42:39,760 --> 02:42:41,600
Up here we are

1646
02:42:41,600 --> 02:42:43,020
right

1647
02:42:43,020 --> 02:42:44,770
right

1648
02:42:44,770 --> 02:42:46,770
Right forward

1649
02:42:46,850 --> 02:42:48,690
Here we go. You're ready

1650
02:42:48,690 --> 02:42:55,500
There's a person down here. Did you just come to the wall madness? Yeah

1651
02:42:57,020 --> 02:43:00,059
I'm here to get you out

1652
02:43:00,059 --> 02:43:02,940
Are you hurt anywhere? No, but he's

1653
02:43:03,579 --> 02:43:05,020
He's coming back

1654
02:43:05,020 --> 02:43:10,299
Who is oh he is what I knew it his polite demeanor was all in act, wasn't it?

1655
02:43:10,860 --> 02:43:12,059
It's true

1656
02:43:12,059 --> 02:43:14,059
He kept me here alone at first

1657
02:43:14,379 --> 02:43:17,100
Tried to get me to talk. So it was a guy that got the hit in the face bottom

1658
02:43:18,700 --> 02:43:23,180
But when he found out I truly didn't know the treasure's final location. He

1659
02:43:23,979 --> 02:43:32,979
Grew angry very angry. I don't know what he's gone and done now or when he's coming back. I'm so sorry

1660
02:43:33,620 --> 02:43:35,219
This is all my fault

1661
02:43:35,219 --> 02:43:37,219
Have you been in decay for the last few days?

1662
02:43:37,540 --> 02:43:42,579
I don't think you had any part in this. I did though long before the festival nearly all my life

1663
02:43:42,739 --> 02:43:48,500
I treated so unpoorly just because I was told to we all did that would make anyone furious

1664
02:43:48,659 --> 02:43:51,620
Like everybody was just wicked mean to him and

1665
02:43:54,020 --> 02:43:57,540
Uh, it still doesn't excuse everyone else. He anything else he's done. You could have been hurt

1666
02:43:58,579 --> 02:44:00,579
Maybe sorry. I'm gonna be yeah, you could have been hurt

1667
02:44:03,540 --> 02:44:08,420
He explained this yeah, I know but I thought he was gonna make it up for so long do you

1668
02:44:09,299 --> 02:44:11,299
No, I guess I don't

1669
02:44:11,860 --> 02:44:16,819
Maybe this is a wake-up call for all of us. Come on, magnus. I promise elizabeth

1670
02:44:16,819 --> 02:44:22,260
I bring you back in one piece and I don't like to disappoint elizabeth. Is she all right?

1671
02:44:22,340 --> 02:44:28,420
I I need to talk to her. I made a terrible mistake. She's a-okay. Let's get out of here

1672
02:44:28,659 --> 02:44:30,659
I know just the girl to find us some backup

1673
02:44:32,850 --> 02:44:34,850
What is that i thought it was an animal

1674
02:44:38,739 --> 02:44:43,219
I'm somewhere inside the volcanic caves near skip rock. How do you have service down here?

1675
02:44:43,299 --> 02:44:45,459
And I think we're kind of in dire straits here

1676
02:44:45,940 --> 02:44:47,940
Soran's the one responsible for all this

1677
02:44:58,719 --> 02:45:05,110
We already know how to get out of here i've been i've been oh the cave is collapsing

1678
02:45:09,950 --> 02:45:12,129
It was me wait what

1679
02:45:27,090 --> 02:45:29,090
The treasure

1680
02:45:32,899 --> 02:45:37,889
Quick quick push him run ram him at full speed right now. His back is turned

1681
02:45:38,530 --> 02:45:44,829
He did not swing that thing. He's gonna lift it up. It's gonna be too heavy for him

1682
02:45:46,479 --> 02:45:49,700
What?

1683
02:45:49,700 --> 02:46:00,530
Wait, I don't know

1684
02:46:00,530 --> 02:46:04,450
Is it weird that if I think okay if he swung that axe at me and hit me

1685
02:46:05,170 --> 02:46:07,170
I don't think it would do that much damage

1686
02:46:08,290 --> 02:46:11,569
You still have to swing it and hit it hard. It might get me pretty bad

1687
02:46:11,649 --> 02:46:14,209
Maybe a little bit, but I think I could take them. I think I could take them

1688
02:46:17,329 --> 02:46:19,329
It probably wouldn't be that bad of a of a

1689
02:46:20,049 --> 02:46:21,090
wound

1690
02:46:21,090 --> 02:46:24,979
Not a chance right now

1691
02:46:24,979 --> 02:46:26,979
Okay, so we

1692
02:46:28,139 --> 02:46:30,139
Am I supposed to be running away from him?

1693
02:46:40,819 --> 02:46:43,500
Are you gonna are you gonna do anything?

1694
02:46:43,500 --> 02:46:50,799
You guys don't think I could take them?

1695
02:46:50,799 --> 02:46:54,559
Okay, bye. Goodbye. Uh nice menacing talk that we had

1696
02:47:03,709 --> 02:47:06,979
There's your treasure

1697
02:47:08,260 --> 02:47:11,700
East india company and the detail it's

1698
02:47:12,479 --> 02:47:14,840
exquisite at these years

1699
02:47:14,940 --> 02:47:19,379
I found it. It was all worth it

1700
02:47:20,370 --> 02:47:22,370
All right

1701
02:47:27,600 --> 02:47:30,500
That's just like a big it's like a playhouse like a dollhouse

1702
02:47:36,159 --> 02:47:38,159
I could take that hit I'd really good

1703
02:47:41,899 --> 02:47:44,540
That would hurt but it wouldn't do that much damage

1704
02:47:48,030 --> 02:47:52,670
You just killed you. No, I didn't that's done. That's done find the real treasure

1705
02:47:53,389 --> 02:48:03,329
Is another okay, there's an illusory wall back here that he didn't see

1706
02:48:04,799 --> 02:48:08,399
Sorry, dude. You missed the entire you missed the entire tree level

1707
02:48:09,979 --> 02:48:18,559
Sorry, soren

1708
02:48:18,559 --> 02:48:27,229
It's not a myth. These images are from laurence's final letter. You just need to press them correctly

1709
02:48:29,090 --> 02:48:32,450
Press the images in the correct order according to laurence's final letter

1710
02:48:41,469 --> 02:48:43,139
Is this it?

1711
02:48:43,139 --> 02:48:52,049
No, is this it?

1712
02:48:52,049 --> 02:48:54,690
Now recall the words i've sung to you so many times

1713
02:48:55,809 --> 02:49:46,940
What's the song?

1714
02:49:46,940 --> 02:49:48,940
Oh

1715
02:49:49,260 --> 02:49:55,389
I'm, sorry. Oh, yeah. Okay. Um, where's the song?

1716
02:50:03,170 --> 02:50:09,309
Oh, do you speak english? Yes little no, that's not lyrics to a song

1717
02:50:12,190 --> 02:50:15,069
Where's the song?

1718
02:50:15,069 --> 02:50:17,389
You have my song and where is it?

1719
02:50:18,110 --> 02:50:19,969
Here we go

1720
02:50:19,969 --> 02:50:23,489
foreign shore behind me and a hundred more to go

1721
02:50:24,209 --> 02:50:28,450
On stormy season starless nights caught on a cold wind's blow

1722
02:50:28,450 --> 02:50:29,649
So

1723
02:50:29,649 --> 02:50:33,809
So many years have put my battered bow up to the test

1724
02:50:35,149 --> 02:50:37,149
along just who cares

1725
02:50:37,229 --> 02:50:45,309
I have to put this I like my way better

1726
02:51:22,299 --> 02:51:31,379
What I did them all? Oh, wait, what was that?

1727
02:51:47,459 --> 02:52:15,940
What no your dog died. So you broke your heart. How is that not part of the song?

1728
02:52:31,520 --> 02:52:33,860
Holy shit, this is incredible

1729
02:52:34,340 --> 02:52:41,959
Nancy are you back there madness? I'm here. I found the I wouldn't say anything

1730
02:52:44,260 --> 02:52:49,959
Yeah, this uh, i'm stuck right here bunch of ice help go get help

1731
02:53:15,120 --> 02:53:17,120
Nancy you can take one coin

1732
02:53:17,680 --> 02:53:21,379
No one's paying you

1733
02:53:21,379 --> 02:53:24,500
You can take a small shoe box and rifle in

1734
02:53:25,299 --> 02:53:30,579
Just three or four handfuls of gold coins and just stick it just down in the front of your pants and just leave it there

1735
02:53:31,059 --> 02:53:33,059
You know what I mean? Like I would just put it in my underwear

1736
02:53:33,860 --> 02:53:37,780
Just stick it down straight down in the back of my underwear and then cover it with a big jacket

1737
02:53:41,159 --> 02:53:47,270
That's okay nancy to get you can give the rest uh someone tried to kill us

1738
02:53:48,790 --> 02:53:50,790
He's a danger to the town's safety

1739
02:53:50,790 --> 02:53:54,709
You got it ladies. See you soon. I think i'm calling this case closed

1740
02:53:55,590 --> 02:53:57,840
Did I win?

1741
02:53:57,840 --> 02:54:03,440
The secret of skip rot's famous treasure is finally put to rest and the case is closed

1742
02:54:03,760 --> 02:54:08,159
Soren was arrested the minute magnus and I arrested in the cave as it turns out

1743
02:54:08,239 --> 02:54:13,360
He was the one following magnus all along looking for his chance to take the treasure for himself

1744
02:54:13,680 --> 02:54:16,559
He followed magnus onto the ship just before ice jail

1745
02:54:17,360 --> 02:54:21,040
Knocked him unconscious and took him to the ice caves using his dinghy

1746
02:54:21,520 --> 02:54:25,680
When he realized magnus didn't know the final location he came after me

1747
02:54:26,319 --> 02:54:31,120
Luckily, I beat him to the finish line. The treasure is in good hands with elizabeth

1748
02:54:31,440 --> 02:54:34,399
Her family legacy has finally come full circle

1749
02:54:34,799 --> 02:54:38,959
Magnus apologized to elizabeth for having been so distant leading up to the festival

1750
02:54:39,280 --> 02:54:42,479
The two of them are doing well another case closed finally got that ship

1751
02:54:42,559 --> 02:54:48,639
He's always dreamed of he and elizabeth packed their things and left to travel the world and of course toomy went too

1752
02:54:49,280 --> 02:54:53,520
I just got a call from elizabeth. I think they're somewhere near thailand as we speak

1753
02:54:53,760 --> 02:54:57,120
Did they go with the boat skip pub and gunner's hands while she's gone

1754
02:54:57,600 --> 02:54:59,600
Gunner seems to be happier than ever

1755
02:54:59,600 --> 02:55:02,639
He's back on his feet and he even took me out on a fishing trip

1756
02:55:03,120 --> 02:55:07,200
He's still pretty cranky when it comes to tourists, but I think he'll get the hang of things

1757
02:55:07,440 --> 02:55:11,520
Dagny and magnus donated their exploration rights to the heurlic hide back to skip rot

1758
02:55:12,000 --> 02:55:16,399
The ship is now fully public property and is open to tourists at all times of the year

1759
02:55:16,639 --> 02:55:18,639
Dagny stayed in skip rock for a little while

1760
02:55:18,719 --> 02:55:22,079
But she split soon after she got her share of the treasure at first

1761
02:55:22,079 --> 02:55:25,680
She seemed to contend to stay but after a couple of days with no action

1762
02:55:25,840 --> 02:55:28,079
It seemed like she was itching to get out on the road

1763
02:55:28,639 --> 02:55:32,799
She didn't say much about where she was going, but I later found a note in my room at the pub

1764
02:55:33,360 --> 02:55:38,100
Catch you later friend. I gave ned the anniversary gift. I got him from the skip rot gift shop

1765
02:55:38,260 --> 02:55:40,260
Ha ha ha

1766
02:55:42,500 --> 02:55:48,180
Hey ned, I found like 60 million dollars in gold coins. Here's a souvenir from the gift shop

1767
02:56:04,250 --> 02:56:06,250
Which was not one of the waterfront shops

1768
02:56:06,969 --> 02:56:08,489
the heart of odin

1769
02:56:08,489 --> 02:56:11,260
We'll get I get to nominate with awards

1770
02:56:12,219 --> 02:56:15,559

1772
02:56:24,600 --> 02:56:30,040
No, how did it know?

1773
02:56:30,040 --> 02:56:32,440
Nice job on the game facts usage

1774
02:56:42,229 --> 02:56:48,389
You do know it only took you a month to solve the case put a little love in your heart egged time to make an omelet

1775
02:56:49,879 --> 02:56:54,440
Look out you're not afraid of heights compulsive spender or oh, yeah, because there's a sword. I didn't get the sword

1776
02:56:59,219 --> 02:57:01,459
Wait a minute the prequel to the last this one we did

1777

Nancy drew in the live concert

1785
02:58:12,620 --> 02:58:23,350
I could probably sing

1786
02:58:23,350 --> 02:58:25,350
I could probably sing like this if I wanted

1787
02:58:26,229 --> 02:58:28,659
to play ninja turtles

1788
02:58:28,819 --> 02:58:30,819
You still remember that?

1789
02:58:40,760 --> 02:58:42,440
People can be really mad

1790
02:58:42,440 --> 02:58:47,139
