1
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:51,320
How's it going? I'm not late. I'm out maybe, I am 60 seconds, 30 seconds, maybe if that.

2
00:00:51,960 --> 00:01:05,939
Would you ask what size toothpick do you use? I don't, I don't think I've ever used a toothpick

3
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:17,980
based on, buying it based on its size. I think I've only ever, I think I've only ever bought

4
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:27,909
toothpicks maybe three times in my entire life. And I really mean that maybe two or three times

5
00:01:27,909 --> 00:01:38,219
total. Where's driver? All right, hold on. Just wait, I'll explain. I'll talk about it. Just wait a

6
00:01:38,219 --> 00:01:52,739
minute. I wanted to ask how the tortoise you hit an Elden Ring but you never finished off is doing.

7
00:01:53,620 --> 00:02:05,349
Will you just go drink a glass of water? Does somebody know? Does somebody say true?

8
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:17,800
No, they didn't. Did I make that up? No, nobody did. I made it up. True. Change your pinned tweet.

9
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:27,110
I can't, I can't yet. All right, let's talk. Here's the deal. I was going to play driver today.

10
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:39,530
I decided not to because I was going to play it on PC but the PC version is kind of all messed up

11
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:44,569
on any of the newer operating systems. There's a patch you can get that fixes a lot of stuff

12
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:55,500
but it still has resolution issues. So what I've decided to do is this, not today

13
00:02:56,729 --> 00:03:01,129
but I don't know later on this coming week, this coming weekend, maybe something like that.

14
00:03:02,409 --> 00:03:09,509
I'm just going to get it from PlayStation 1 and we're going back. We're going back to PlayStation

15
00:03:09,509 --> 00:03:23,689
1 Xbox old console Insanity Night. Kicking it off with driver one. We're going to do a,

16
00:03:25,509 --> 00:03:33,000
is that considered retro? I don't know. Retro in my brain and maybe it's because we're,

17
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:43,560
you know, different ages but when I think of retro I think of Pong. I think of the NES. I think of

18
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:50,710
the Super Nintendo. Is retro PS2? Is that considered retro or is that some in-between period?

19
00:03:53,020 --> 00:04:06,580
How many years have to go by for something to be retro? 10, 15, 20 years? 15, 20? I don't think a

20
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:13,300
decade. I think a decade is not long enough. Please at least try King's Field 1 and 2.

21
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:24,170
Pong is vintage. PS2 would be retro. That's true. Did you start Mob Psycho? I did not.

22
00:04:26,149 --> 00:04:32,740
No, I did not. PS3 would be retro if it was a decade. Yeah, that's not enough. These would

23
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:45,269
be at least 15, 20. But anyways, that is what's happening this weekend. So today, change of plans

24
00:04:45,269 --> 00:04:54,069
today. Gonna just play something fun, something cozy. I've, you know, had my eye on a few games.

25
00:04:54,790 --> 00:05:04,740
Landed on this one called A Little to the Left. It's a game about organizing. I think it's kind

26
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:11,850
of in the same world as that unpacking game, I think. So we'll see. I don't know. It's like

27
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:22,600
a puzzle game where you have to organize things correctly. I think. He's gonna mauled. I don't

28
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:29,779
think so. So we're gonna have a chill day today. Just gonna relax, play a little bit. And this

29
00:05:29,779 --> 00:05:36,660
takes us not very long. We'll do something else. Are you gonna play Tetris? I'm never gonna play

30
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:53,160
Tetris. Jerma, don't chill. Why not? I can't play Tetris. We've talked about this a thousand

31
00:05:53,160 --> 00:06:01,500
times. I cannot play Tetris. I put down the first row and then just start shaking. I just hate it.

32
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:10,379
I have to get out. I don't even get past one cycle of dun dun dun dun dun dun dun. One cycle of that

33
00:06:10,379 --> 00:06:20,180
and I'm gone. I just, honestly, I played Tetris just to hear that song once. And I go, all right,

34
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:31,959
that was fun. No more. Played Beam NG? I did a few months ago, right? A couple months ago.

35
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:42,339
Let's play Checkers. Frog Detective, you liar. The longer you wait for Frog Detective when it

36
00:06:42,339 --> 00:06:53,269
actually happens, you're going to freak out. You should play with chat GPT. You know, maybe I will

37
00:06:53,269 --> 00:07:03,449
as soon here, but I don't have that prepared. You should play Pong. Pong to me sounds more like a

38
00:07:03,449 --> 00:07:17,139
punishment stream. Like you gotta play Pong for an hour. I want you to be honest. Would you play Pong

39
00:07:17,779 --> 00:07:29,910
for one straight hour? I'm seeing, I'm seeing a ton of nos. No, no, no, no, no way. No way.

40
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:37,529
Okay. What would it take for you to play Pong for one hour? Would someone have to pay you to play

41
00:07:37,529 --> 00:07:48,069
Pong? Not versus the person. No, versus the computer. Pong versus the computer for one hour.

42
00:07:48,709 --> 00:08:05,290
100 bucks, 50 bucks, 100 bucks, $500 dude. What? Actually, I mean, that like sucks. Playing Pong

43
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:09,290
and that's all you can do for an hour. That's true. That actually would be, that'd actually,

44
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:22,620
yeah, that'd be hard to sit there for more than like 30, 40 minutes. 50 bucks, 40 bucks. I would

45
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:30,579
do it for a Philly cheesesteak. You know, that's actually pretty good. A real one. You mean like

46
00:08:30,579 --> 00:08:37,860
from Philadelphia, not the people that just say Philly cheesesteak, but we're in Cincinnati and

47
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:42,580
it's not even close. Do you mean like a real one from Philadelphia? I think it's, I would play Pong

48
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:48,570
for five hours to get one of those. Yeah. I would play, I would do a full five hour Pong stream.

49
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:56,730
If a, like one of the best Philly cheesesteaks from Philadelphia teleported hot, fresh, ready to go

50
00:08:57,529 --> 00:09:05,529
in the middle of my room is worth it for me. Like, and I'm talking nice and hot,

51
00:09:05,529 --> 00:09:08,730
fresh. They just made it and it's from one of the best places in Philadelphia.

52
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:20,230
That'd be worth it. No, not on the floor. I mean, I put my hands out and it goes,

53
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:27,029
I put both my hands out and it does the camera trick that was shocking back in the fifties,

54
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:34,179
where you just hold your arms out and, and then they cut and then they put the sandwich there

55
00:09:34,899 --> 00:09:39,779
and they roll again and they make a sound effect and the actor kind of shifts a little and like

56
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:47,669
moves their arms up or down a little bit and it's just there in their hands. That's what I want.

57
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:57,690
What the fuck is a cheesesteak? What? Oh my God. Really? You don't know if that is. I mean,

58
00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:07,779
I wouldn't eat one every day. I'm a new viewer. Hi. That's interesting considering you've been

59
00:10:07,779 --> 00:10:15,980
subscribed for 29 straight months. I don't know if you're on somebody else's computer right now, but

60
00:10:18,309 --> 00:10:26,779
you've been here for years. I don't know what a cheesesteak is either. A cheesesteak is

61
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:36,740
shaved or chopped steak that you cook on a flat top and you put maybe some onions in it. I don't

62
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:44,019
know. It depends on who you talk to. You put some cheese on it, slide it into a big, nice hoagie

63
00:10:44,019 --> 00:10:51,779
roll, cheese whiz on it. I don't know. I would, I, I've never had a real one. I've just had

64
00:10:51,779 --> 00:11:05,059
imitations. No, you don't put milk on it. What are your thoughts on schnitzel? I'm a new viewer as

65
00:11:05,059 --> 00:11:15,240
well. Um, schnitzel's awesome. Anything that's breaded and, you know, smashed to a point where

66
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:29,940
it's crispy and delicious. Of course it's going to be great. What about haggis? No, I've never,

67
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:35,299
I'm not going to eat haggis. All right. Hey, is this, is this food AMA hour or are we playing a

68
00:11:35,299 --> 00:11:41,049
game? Well, it's a chill stream. We can, whatever. All right. Okay. A little to the left. Let's,

69
00:11:41,049 --> 00:11:51,129
let's play it. See how it is. If you can hear it. You can now. There we go. Okay. So this game is

70
00:11:51,129 --> 00:11:56,950
going to be super cool. I don't know. I don't have, I'm not going to eat sir. What is it? Sir

71
00:11:56,950 --> 00:12:05,059
Stroming? No. Oh, eat sir Stroming. You mean the thing where people literally take a can opener,

72
00:12:06,549 --> 00:12:12,539
puncture it, start to turn. And then all of a sudden everybody in the area goes,

73
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:25,820
no, it's a, every single time I've ever seen a sir. Oh, we're going to do a sir Stroming thing.

74
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:34,840
They puncture the can. It goes something that can fill the air with that much smell in less

75
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:50,440
than one second is something I don't want to put near my face. Okay. I don't want that near my face.

76
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:59,019
Your face cam is on right now. All right. So how does this work? I'm ready to organize. Would you

77
00:12:59,019 --> 00:13:05,340
ever eat haggis? No, I'm not. I'm not going to eat foods. I don't want to eat home sweet home.

78
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:17,019
All right. This is going to be cool. Are you guys ready? There he is. Okay. So how do I do this?

79
00:13:17,019 --> 00:13:28,889
Where's the fucking safe? Where's the fucking safe? Is that right? Oh, I did. Okay. I actually,

80
00:13:28,889 --> 00:13:44,759
I had to do, Oh wait, I have to organize this. Should I do, honestly, it's just all going in

81
00:13:44,759 --> 00:13:50,860
there without any rhyme or reason because I don't do, are you going to, that's going to get messed

82
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:54,700
up anyways. That your pet goes over there, picks out whatever they want and then just knocks the

83
00:13:54,700 --> 00:14:25,269
whole thing over. Is that right? Oh, this color up here. Okay. Hold on. I feel like I'm watching a

84
00:14:25,269 --> 00:14:41,059
baby sensory video. All right. Hold on. This is, it's getting a little hard. How do I know

85
00:14:41,059 --> 00:15:15,750
where the beginning is? It's right there, right? Yeah. I had it. Here we go. It's right there. I

86
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:18,870
had it right. I had it correct. This is, I didn't know I had to, I thought they had to be touching.

87
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:37,639
There you go. This shit drives me crazy in real life. Every time I, I, something on the wall,

88
00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:43,210
like a painting or a picture or something, and you have to get it sorted, but the music just

89
00:15:43,210 --> 00:16:07,580
changed. This is by size. Is it big on the bottom? Okay. It's big on the bottom like that. That kind

90
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:33,909
of felt good. Slow down. I can't keep up. You're going to be all right. Where's the ding? Is it,

91
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:52,549
does it want to buy thickness or does it want to buy height or thickness? Here it is. I got it.

92
00:16:52,549 --> 00:17:19,559
It was height. Shit. I should have gone, I should have gone bottom to top. Sick. You legitimately

93
00:17:19,559 --> 00:17:54,220
look like a toddler. That's very weird. Stamps. Yes. What's going on? Oh, oh, these are animals

94
00:17:54,220 --> 00:18:10,339
up here. Okay. Now I sort them. No, we're good. This is, I like this. Are you seriously faking?

95
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:17,259
Okay. You don't, I'm sorry, but you don't open up like a chill game and just like relax and play it

96
00:18:17,259 --> 00:18:23,140
and have somebody be annoyed with how you are chilling. Are you really mad at how I'm chilling

97
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:29,960
right now? How I'm chilling? Hey bro, dude, ah, you're not chilling the right way. You're

98
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:37,799
not doing it right. You can't, you can't tell somebody how to chill. This is not a backseat

99
00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:43,769
scenario. This is a chilling out scenario. You don't walk into somebody's room. Nah, dude,

100
00:18:43,769 --> 00:18:51,900
you're doing it wrong. You're not chilling out right. Hey, did you smoke yet? You smoked today?

101
00:18:51,900 --> 00:19:09,210
No. Ah, fucking idiot. You fucking idiot. All right. Listen, I'm chilling again, but you're

102
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:15,609
going to walk in my room. You're going to walk in my room, holding one in. You know what I mean?

103
00:19:15,609 --> 00:19:23,240
Like you just walk in. What's up, dude? Fucking cough out that smoke. And like you, you, why didn't

104
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:28,740
you just breathe that hit up before you walked in the room? What is this? What is this for kids?

105
00:19:28,740 --> 00:20:28,220
Is this a kids game? Bro, I'm chilling. Don't tell me how to, how to do it. Oh, I thought it was

106
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:38,630
making a circle. I thought it was making a big circle. I'm trying to make a circle. Don't tell

107
00:20:38,630 --> 00:21:02,069
me how to chill. This is not what I thought it was going to be. Did I just do that wrong, but still

108
00:21:02,069 --> 00:21:20,410
got it right? What am I doing? Oh, what do these say? Are these colors? Why is two written upside?

109
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:37,019
No, is that a two upside down? What is that? What is one? This one's two, one, two, three, four, five.

110
00:21:37,019 --> 00:21:45,700
All right. What does that have to do with the colors? I got it. You didn't, you did not know

111
00:21:45,700 --> 00:22:12,089
that until I just did that. You actually did not know until you saw me do it. Idiot. There we go.

112
00:22:12,089 --> 00:22:28,250
I like this game calendar. All right. The second this gets to be, they're going to, they're going

113
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:32,250
to pull a papers, please. Isn't it? It's going to get so hard. I think it's going to get too much

114
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:47,529
for me. We'll find out. I'm chilling. Yes, I am. Once papers, please introduced the fourth thing

115
00:22:47,529 --> 00:22:59,660
you had to pay attention to. I just let everybody in. Once it was like ID, birth certificate, work

116
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:03,750
form. Once it got to be three or four different things, I just was like, you know what? Let me

117
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:12,900
look at the ID and then stamp you or whatever. All right. Speaking of this. All right. Here we go.

118
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:24,460
This is, wait, what? Whoa. That actually had, you had to pull it. Look at this. You have to rip it

119
00:23:24,460 --> 00:24:03,619
off. I don't, I don't get it. Or one, two, three, four. I don't get it. One, two, the star is on day

120
00:24:03,619 --> 00:24:11,140
three and day 12. 12 is divisible by three, three, six, nine, 12 by four. So therefore this has to go

121
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:24,710
on the four. I don't know. Three. Um, hold on. Three, 12. That's nine days. So one, two, three, four,

122
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:34,099
five, six, seven, eight, nine. I for some reason thought I had to do stuff up here. Okay. So this

123
00:24:34,099 --> 00:24:46,180
is one, this doesn't show up anymore. Okay. So 10, so 10 days. So then this has to be here. Wait,

124
00:24:46,180 --> 00:25:10,170
what? Oh no, it's just nine days for everything. Okay. That's be legible. I don't have any more

125
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:38,359
of these ones though. Doesn't have to be perfect. Wait, what? What's happening? That's what I meant

126
00:25:38,359 --> 00:25:45,980
to do. This reminds me of math class. Please stop. You're going to just something in my eye

127
00:25:45,980 --> 00:26:19,720
every one second. Why'd you do that? I cursed you to have something in your eye. All right. The

128
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:27,109
game's called, uh, a little to the left, right? We're going to do this by size. What did you stop

129
00:26:27,109 --> 00:26:56,180
that? Reverse it. Shit. That's actually kind of hard. I just wanted to do a sorting algorithm.

130
00:26:56,180 --> 00:27:33,049
Yeah. Like he's the same size. That not it. It's not this height. There's more things than how

131
00:27:33,049 --> 00:27:52,380
tall something is. Oh God. Wait a minute. How do I know what the first one is? How do I know what

132
00:27:52,380 --> 00:30:17,849
the first one is? Oh shit. Okay. I just got to get it. Let him cook. What am I doing? I, it's a

133
00:30:17,849 --> 00:30:27,660
mirror. It's a mirror. I'm sorry, but at this point, if I'm setting up my bookshelf and I am

134
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:37,289
looking at this shit, I'm just spinning spine in and we're going height. We're doing spine in

135
00:30:37,289 --> 00:30:53,849
by height. Is this the middle? This has to be the middle then, right? There wouldn't be a big

136
00:30:53,849 --> 00:31:00,039
flourish in the middle like this. This is a big flourish. This is a big flourish. It has to be

137
00:31:00,039 --> 00:32:36,299
the middle. This is, it has to be over here. Why am I taking so long doing this? This has to be in

138
00:32:36,299 --> 00:32:50,180
the middle, but how do I know what the end, what, how do I know which one's the end? Why even make

139
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:56,329
this? Why can't you just make it a name? Make it like, oh, like, like Arthur or like Gregory.

140
00:32:56,329 --> 00:33:25,900
Just make it so I can put it easy. I'm confused. It's so, it's, it's a mirrored image. So that

141
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:34,980
means some of this shit cannot be over here. I'm fucking the whole thing up because nothing can,

142
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:45,589
how do I, what can attach to this? This edge is too tall. See what I mean? Like this is,

143
00:33:45,589 --> 00:34:01,859
this edge is too tall. Nothing can fit here. Is that it? No, it's not. That can't be it, right?

144
00:34:01,859 --> 00:34:19,219
I don't, I don't, I don't understand it. This is too many symbols on the screen. See, if I was in

145
00:34:19,219 --> 00:34:27,420
my bed with my iPad, I would be sitting there going like this. It's fucking stupid. This is

146
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:35,860
so fucking dumb. Fuck this, this game. This is stupid. This is a fucking dumb game. And then I

147
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:50,460
would, I would eventually figure it out and go, oh, this is cute. I like this. Mods, what do I do?

148
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:55,239
Give me some guidance. I don't understand. I don't know what, I don't know what the break point is

149
00:34:55,239 --> 00:35:12,760
for the mirror because like it did, it just goes like this. I don't get it. This, then this is not

150
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:21,690
the middle then it can't be. You all said, yes, this is the middle. You are lying to me. There

151
00:35:21,690 --> 00:35:29,139
ain't nothing that fits here. The only thing that fits here is this. This is it. Nothing else can

152
00:35:29,139 --> 00:35:56,860
fit here. You had it before. Compare the height of the two mirrored pieces. Height and, height and

153
00:35:56,860 --> 00:36:04,969
pattern. The hell? Oh, I've thought it was just, I thought it was just pattern this time. Wait,

154
00:36:04,969 --> 00:36:19,110
height and pattern? This is the worst gamer moment. I just don't understand. It can't be height. No,

155
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:24,760
it can't. Oh, yeah. Yeah. It's a chill stream, but I'm just going to tell, I'm telling you.

156
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:28,280
Some of you guys would open this, but if you're on your fucking iPad and guess what you're going

157
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:33,619
to do? You're going to go, I think I'd rather just go eat something. I get a snack and you're going

158
00:36:33,619 --> 00:36:41,349
to press the home button. It's going to disappear and you can just run away. You get to go, you get

159
00:36:41,349 --> 00:36:53,880
to go like this. It's gone. It's just pattern. I'm going to blow through the rest of this fucking

160
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:58,739
game. I'm telling you right now. I promise you. It's just like the different squigglies. My brain

161
00:36:58,739 --> 00:37:03,210
just is like, they're all the same. I said this year we're going to chill. We're going to do a

162
00:37:03,210 --> 00:37:28,329
little bit more chilling. I'm going to be stuck here forever. I just don't understand what they

163
00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:42,869
want me to do. Just pattern, but it's height and pattern. No shot. You're going to do it. The only,

164
00:37:42,869 --> 00:37:48,469
the two curly ones are at each end and the one everyone says is the middle is the middle. All

165
00:37:48,469 --> 00:37:59,219
the rest are doubles. Yeah, but that's what I have, but nothing else can connect to this. Watch this.

166
00:37:59,219 --> 00:38:06,059
Yeah, that's what I had. See, but nothing else can connect to this. Bro, if it's this, I'm going to

167
00:38:06,059 --> 00:38:11,510
be real mad. This one doesn't fit. This one, I'm going to be pissed if it's this one. These don't

168
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:21,619
fit. These actually don't fit. This is a fucked up weird image and this is not, it doesn't fit.

169
00:38:21,619 --> 00:38:27,130
It is it, isn't it? It's it. It is it. This doesn't look like it's supposed to fit. This doesn't look

170
00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:59,139
like it's supposed to fit. What even is this picture? They're all the same image in my head.

171
00:38:59,139 --> 00:39:13,820
If I don't beat the next one in less than one minute, I will something. Dude, these all blend

172
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:17,860
into the same picture in my head. I can't see anything but the same line. They're all the same

173
00:39:17,860 --> 00:40:24,360
line. What side is this one on? Where does this one go? Dude, where does this one go? This one

174
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:31,320
can't be here, right? Like this, because it's, there's two of each one. So there has to be one

175
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:57,670
on each side, right? This is correct. So where do these fucking random ass pieces go? Calm down,

176
00:40:57,670 --> 00:41:49,690
switch them. What do you want me to do? What's wrong with this? I got it. I got it. Give me one

177
00:41:49,690 --> 00:42:24,920
minute. Give me one minute. Literally one minute. Come on. That's correct right here, please. Wait,

178
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:39,460
what is it saying? That's not right. I was just, that's how is it not flat? One minute told you.

179
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:54,860
Oh shit. No, no. These little squiggly lines. I can't do the squiggly lines. Oh boy. Everybody

180
00:42:54,860 --> 00:43:17,219
put it into, don't, no, don't even. You know what I just realized? I'm the guy that walks into the

181
00:43:17,219 --> 00:43:28,630
room holding in the fucking blunt smoke. I just realized it right now. It's me. I'm the guy that

182
00:43:28,630 --> 00:43:44,280
leans in. Who is this? Ah, now fuck that. I'm gonna go play Super Mario. So this is correct here.

183
00:43:44,280 --> 00:44:22,329
It's got a line here. No, I mean, this is correct. This might be bait though. It's in the wrong spot,

184
00:44:22,329 --> 00:45:54,500
but. Ah, look at that. What is this even supposed to be a picture of? What was that? What is this

185
00:45:54,500 --> 00:46:14,380
thing? What was that image? It was a doodle. Yeah, but I mean, what was that? I'm trying to make

186
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:35,320
pictures. That's my problem. All right. What does this want me to do? Oh, guys, it's by sharpness.

187
00:46:35,320 --> 00:47:09,940
I got it. It's by sharpness. Oh, the eraser. Guys, we're not getting any dings. It's not

188
00:47:09,940 --> 00:47:48,519
eraser. It's not sharpness. I mean, there's the rainbow. How come I can't? There's no dings. Oh,

189
00:47:48,519 --> 00:48:09,719
right. What is this? By thickness? Height? Thickness? It's definitely gonna be size. Small

190
00:48:09,719 --> 00:48:28,550
to big. Thinness to widthness. Horizontal length. If it's horizontal length, this is it. All right,

191
00:48:28,550 --> 00:49:00,059
it has to be. This is the maybe biggest horizontal length first. That's what I would think. Yeah,

192
00:49:00,059 --> 00:49:07,619
horizontal length. I guess not. Maybe smallest horizontal length. But I had that already,

193
00:49:07,619 --> 00:49:29,699
though. This thing. It's not going to be small to large, right? What? I'm confused. How is it?

194
00:49:29,699 --> 00:50:04,550
It just wants me to spread them out? Is it? What's the pattern here then? Wait a minute. I think

195
00:50:04,550 --> 00:50:20,440
it's going to exactly fit on the screen. Yeah. Okay. All right. I got it. I got it. I got it.

196
00:50:20,440 --> 00:51:50,889
There it is. Great. I'm going. I'm going thinness. This is where we're just talking centimeters. We

197
00:51:50,889 --> 00:51:55,369
can see all the sweat stains all over you. This is a bright. This came right out of the dryer.

198
00:51:55,369 --> 00:52:05,210
Yeah, I know there's patterns on it, but I can't you do this more than somebody said you can do

199
00:52:05,210 --> 00:52:18,760
this more than like a few ways. I can't do it by thickness. Yes, you can. Yeah, I can. I don't have

200
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:49,110
to do it by the pattern. It's so close. These three and these four are the problem. Every,

201
00:52:49,110 --> 00:52:55,880
every book has it. Listen, listen, everybody. I'm going to tell you, you can do each of these

202
00:52:55,880 --> 00:53:00,340
puzzles three or four different ways. It doesn't have to be the patterns. It can just be how it

203
00:53:00,420 --> 00:53:06,099
can be. You can be length wise. It can be the the witness. It could be the length. It could be the

204
00:53:06,099 --> 00:53:23,449
pattern. I'm trying to do it by the witness of the books. Book girth. All right. I'll just do it.

205
00:53:23,449 --> 00:53:32,409
But is that true? Oh, it was people just lying to me. All right. I'll do it by pattern line,

206
00:53:32,409 --> 00:54:00,820
line, line. This one is our glass, our glass line line. These lines should be the height of the line

207
00:54:00,820 --> 00:55:11,019
top to bottom. That'd be a weird way to do this. Is that actually what it is? Oh my God. I thought

208
00:55:11,019 --> 00:55:47,980
I could do it more than one way. I'd put the pencil shavings back on the pencil. I need to

209
00:55:47,980 --> 00:56:04,920
get them all out here. What do these all look like? The one, the line. I think I understand it. Hold

210
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:36,219
on. Two, one, two, three, no, three, four, one, two, three, four, five. Don't overthink it. What

211
00:56:36,219 --> 00:56:45,349
do the symbols mean? Overthinking, overthinking, overthinking, overthinking is the complexity of

212
00:56:45,349 --> 00:56:50,219
the pattern. That's what I was thinking. This is the most complex one, but I don't think that's

213
00:56:50,219 --> 00:57:03,900
correct. What's with the shavings though? Why are they here? What's the point of these? This is the

214
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:25,099
most, this is the least complex line. Just do it by height. I tried that the other time and it didn't

215
00:57:25,099 --> 00:57:41,449
work. The pencil shavings are the pattern. All right, but how do, what am I supposed to, right?

216
00:57:41,449 --> 00:57:51,190
Because it's like squiggle, squiggle, squiggle. Just do trial and just brute force it. Try it by

217
00:57:51,190 --> 00:58:32,019
height. I think that's going to do anything. Get all this shit out of the way. How do I match these

218
00:58:32,019 --> 00:58:41,110
up? Where am I supposed to place it? Like this one is without a doubt right here, but how do I,

219
00:58:41,110 --> 00:58:56,219
what am I supposed to, where, wait, what do I put it? Throw them away. Clean them up. Size of the

220
00:58:56,219 --> 00:59:03,449
shavings with their shape, but wouldn't, this is correct though. This is like, this is like just a

221
00:59:03,449 --> 00:59:25,059
small one, right? It's just decorative. It's, wait, is it actually just decorative? Let them above or

222
00:59:25,059 --> 01:00:07,400
below maybe. There ain't enough shavings. Throw them off the screen. What just happened? That's

223
01:00:07,400 --> 01:01:07,860
what I was supposed to do? I don't know who this artist is.

224
01:01:08,340 --> 01:01:16,340
But your music is bad. I don't know like what record this is, but it's the same two loops.

225
01:01:19,849 --> 01:01:30,710
Oh wow. Okay. Okay. I got it. Okay. But hold on. I thought that was different tracks.

226
01:01:37,739 --> 01:02:08,699
Call that one looking out the window over an airplane. Whoa. Hold on. What kind of soup is

227
01:02:08,699 --> 01:02:29,239
this? Shit. I'm sorry. I just went like, I got mad. So this is the left side of the can. This is

228
01:02:29,239 --> 01:02:41,139
the middle of the can, right? Like that. And this is the right side of the can. And what does it want

229
01:02:41,139 --> 01:02:51,139
me to do? I wonder. This pattern here is this. I don't know what that's trying to tell me.

230
01:02:51,139 --> 01:03:09,900
What's my IQ? More than you. Last time I took it, it was 70, 71. You're overthinking it. Am I though?

231
01:03:09,900 --> 01:03:29,460
I'm overthinking it. I don't, I'm not trying to overthink it. I'm just thinking in my brain,

232
01:03:29,460 --> 01:03:39,179
it wants me to show the whole can, right? It wants me to show the whole can. I would need that,

233
01:03:39,179 --> 01:04:10,789
this. Is that not what it wants me to do? Oh wait, what it wants this? Um, make it 71. I don't have

234
01:04:10,789 --> 01:04:18,570
a 71 IQ. It's like, it was 121 when I took it. Um, like now it's been like 10 years, 15 years.

235
01:04:18,570 --> 01:04:27,619
It was 124, went down to 121, which means it's definitely like 115 now, 110. I've, there's no

236
01:04:27,619 --> 01:04:57,989
way I've gotten smarter. I've only gotten slower. Um, sorted by flavor. It's only one can. How would

237
01:04:57,989 --> 01:05:11,460
you arrange this in your kitchen? I would be like, um, first of all, I'd say why, why the heck is

238
01:05:11,460 --> 01:05:40,599
this not Bertoli? It's not one can. What? No, that can't be correct. I thought it was with all the

239
01:05:40,599 --> 01:05:55,909
other stuff. What was with all the other things? Did I get Luigi'd? All right, so we got three.

240
01:05:55,909 --> 01:06:12,340
Let's go over here. A lot and a lot. One, two, three, four, five. Okay. Is it by the amount,

241
01:06:12,340 --> 01:06:19,539
the level of the liquid? Because look, there's three, four, four. Three, four, four, five. One,

242
01:06:19,539 --> 01:06:29,750
two, three, four, four, six. Right? Or should I do, do it by the level of the liquid? I'll try

243
01:06:29,750 --> 01:07:07,059
level of liquid. All right. It's level of liquid. I, I was, I, why have this, that, whatever. There

244
01:07:07,059 --> 01:07:38,900
it is. Oh, this one here. I didn't see this one. I didn't see that. Give it to me. It's right there.

245
01:07:39,380 --> 01:08:26,409
Stack them. But what, I, what, I want to do it by length. Oh, nobody stacks spoons like that.

246
01:08:26,409 --> 01:08:49,350
I got it. I got it. I get to do it from the top. Okay. So I'll just, here it is right there. Okay.

247
01:08:49,350 --> 01:09:03,590
That's correct. This is not correct. That is not correct. That is also not correct. That might be

248
01:09:03,590 --> 01:09:42,489
correct. And it is almost there. Not quite, quite, not quite, not quite. At least he's trying his

249
01:09:42,489 --> 01:09:50,810
best. I don't know about you guys, but puzzle games like this, you're supposed to just kind

250
01:09:50,810 --> 01:10:10,970
of hang out and do it. Nobody just goes, ding. Why didn't you do it faster? Okay. So this is

251
01:10:10,970 --> 01:10:26,119
a bunch of sand into not a lot of sand. I don't think it matters. It doesn't matter what, what

252
01:10:26,119 --> 01:11:57,619
side it starts. Speed run. Thank you. I figured that out really quick. It's not like this was in

253
01:11:57,619 --> 01:12:21,260
the trailer on steam. There's more. I feel like the crumbs in the middle. No, I'll clean it up.

254
01:12:21,260 --> 01:12:46,359
Right. Why, why is there my, what did I do? Minus two pinned by me? Why did I, what, I didn't

255
01:12:46,359 --> 01:13:00,300
pin this. What do you mean pinned by me? I, when did I pin that? He found out. I did not pin this

256
01:13:00,300 --> 01:13:20,890
message. I genuinely don't, I did not do that. How do I unpin this? Did one of the mods do that? I'm,

257
01:13:20,890 --> 01:13:29,060
I'm being very serious. Did a mod do that? Or did I somehow accidentally do that? How did I do that?

258
01:13:29,060 --> 01:13:48,920
I don't even see it. How would a mod do that? It says pinned by you. Oh my God. Okay. So that

259
01:13:48,920 --> 01:13:56,300
was not supposed to be there. So let me explain what happened. I have three monitors and when I

260
01:13:56,300 --> 01:14:07,180
move the chat, the chats, the chats, my chat window. Wow. You got to be kidding me. How long

261
01:14:07,180 --> 01:14:15,560
is it there for? I'm not fucking around. I promise you this. When I, so I, anytime you hear the music

262
01:14:15,560 --> 01:14:21,180
stop like this, it means I've clicked out of the window. So I probably clicked over cause the chat

263
01:14:21,180 --> 01:14:25,819
is right up against the right side of the, of my left monitor, which is over here. This is where

264
01:14:25,819 --> 01:14:36,220
you guys are. And the pin this message is right on the space that connects the monitors. So I must

265
01:14:36,220 --> 01:14:40,060
have just put my mouse over, gone to the other monitor, clicked to get to the other monitor and

266
01:14:40,060 --> 01:14:57,779
clicked pin a random message. And it was minus two. I, I, okay. I thought a mod did that. Whatever.

267
01:14:57,779 --> 01:15:45,670
That's so funny. I can't, I don't know. Should that be that easy to do that? Hold on. I'm uh,

268
01:15:45,670 --> 01:15:56,710
what's that? Oh, yeah. This is the, uh, this is the Xbox. Yeah. Let me just take that. One Xbox.

269
01:15:56,710 --> 01:16:33,079
What? There's no other fruit. Where's the other fruit? All right. One of the workers was just

270
01:16:33,079 --> 01:16:45,300
having fun. Excuse me, sir. What are you doing? I figured it'd be easier if I took all the price

271
01:16:45,300 --> 01:16:54,779
tags off of every item and just went, I just, I just wanted to just get everything in the bag

272
01:16:54,779 --> 01:17:02,170
and then scan everything. Sir. One of those is a TV. Yeah. I mean, I figured it would be easier.

273
01:17:02,170 --> 01:17:33,859
Just get them all on one thing. All right. Do I throw these away? I do. Should I sort these by

274
01:17:33,859 --> 01:18:35,939
my favorites? I think this is pretty accurate. This is from most favorite to least favorite.

275
01:18:35,939 --> 01:19:41,479
Who cares? Just finish it. Chill. Somebody said, dude, you got to do it by the curl factor. Would

276
01:19:41,479 --> 01:19:54,600
this be all the way over here then? I mean, this is technically a curl. These are the most, these

277
01:19:54,600 --> 01:20:16,869
are super swirled. I don't know. Is that what they want? Or is it just by, then these would go first

278
01:20:16,869 --> 01:20:43,939
then? No, they wouldn't. Is it, but is this a curl or is this a twist? You know what I mean? Yeah.

279
01:20:43,939 --> 01:20:52,619
Okay. No, I had it right. I had it right. Give me one second. Give me one second. I'm not trying

280
01:20:52,619 --> 01:22:24,810
to go for the world record. Line it up with the bird. I don't get this one. You have to line it

281
01:22:24,810 --> 01:22:55,960
up with the background. The same image. Was that one as easy as I think it was? Stop. Get this cat

282
01:22:55,960 --> 01:23:17,939
out of here. Stop. I don't want to, what do I do about the cat? Who uses a placemat? I don't. I sit

283
01:23:17,939 --> 01:23:41,909
there and I eat it in my lap in front of the couch. Oh, in front of the couch? I don't know. I just

284
01:23:41,909 --> 01:23:52,310
sit there like this and I eat in front of the couch. Yeah. You see, I sit on the TV. I put the

285
01:23:52,310 --> 01:23:58,260
couch and I sit on this big square thing. It's called a television and I sit on top of it.

286
01:23:58,260 --> 01:24:22,199
It's pretty comfortable and I watch the couch. You know, I can never do breakfast like this

287
01:24:22,199 --> 01:24:30,600
for one reason. I'm kind of an all in or nothing kind of person. There would need to be two handfuls

288
01:24:30,600 --> 01:24:38,199
of blueberries here in the egg. I don't like the, oh, just like three blueberries. Just give me,

289
01:24:38,199 --> 01:24:47,399
give me two full handfuls of blueberries, like six strawberries in the egg. You know,

290
01:24:47,399 --> 01:24:52,140
forget about the toast. Get the toast out of here. You know, maybe like one corner of the toast.

291
01:24:52,140 --> 01:25:00,630
Give her the oranges and then way more of, way more of the fruits. Like another handful,

292
01:25:00,630 --> 01:25:03,430
two handfuls of blueberries. By the way, there'd be two or three, there'd be three eggs here.

293
01:25:03,430 --> 01:25:21,720
Probably two eggs, two eggs, handful of blueberries. Maybe not even, maybe like not even a strawberry.

294
01:25:21,720 --> 01:25:27,899
I don't like heavy breakfasts either. I'm not a big, big, I like yogurt. Yogurt in the morning

295
01:25:27,899 --> 01:25:39,029
is, I think it's just, just doesn't fill you up. Keeps you going. This dude eats blueberries and

296
01:25:39,029 --> 01:25:50,100
eggs. All right. Where does this go? Do I have to make a shape with this or something? Why don't I

297
01:25:50,100 --> 01:27:03,880
just do the funny thing? There it is. Here you go, kid. I wouldn't eat this. I feel like you were

298
01:27:03,880 --> 01:28:11,109
trying to cast a spell on me. I can't move this one. It's okay. So it's got to go. Fuck out of

299
01:28:11,109 --> 01:28:17,140
here. Leave now. Leave. No, actually stay. No, I mean like get out of here. You've been, you've

300
01:28:17,140 --> 01:28:34,779
been in my brain. Fuck with me. Is it based on the river? It's definitely based on the water,

301
01:28:34,779 --> 01:28:55,130
right? No, don't leave. Okay. So this is underwater. I'm going to imagine that's probably

302
01:28:55,130 --> 01:29:04,649
like here. What does a river start? This is in the air. Is it air to up in the air to down on

303
01:29:04,649 --> 01:31:15,659
the river to where the wolf is? You know what I'm saying? It has to be something like that.

304
01:31:15,659 --> 01:31:23,960
How am I supposed to get it right? What's the, this is correct. But how do I, this is right.

305
01:31:23,960 --> 01:31:36,069
But why, there's no dings. Like line them up in the better spot. That's correct. I mean,

306
01:31:36,069 --> 01:32:05,130
it has to be, right? Yeah, this is definitely right. Or is this not right? How does the middle

307
01:32:05,130 --> 01:32:42,359
connect? Uh, it does? Over here maybe? This feels like the logical place for this to go. Is this

308
01:32:42,359 --> 01:32:56,090
wrong? It's not that right? Am I? Oh, I think it is. Shit. I think that is right. Isn't it?

309
01:32:56,090 --> 01:33:26,500
But then how does this connect to something like that? This technically still needs to be down,

310
01:33:26,500 --> 01:34:31,899
right? God damn it. Okay. I got it. This is it. Okay. I just had to move it around. Whoa. Okay.

311
01:34:31,899 --> 01:36:06,090
Hold on. Is there anything else on this bottle? All right. There's something else on this bottle.

312
01:36:06,090 --> 01:36:30,100
God damn it. All right. What's all the way in the back? This is not like that, right? Like this,

313
01:36:30,180 --> 01:39:00,100
like that. Does it want me to connect these? No way. I don't get it. I don't understand.

314
01:39:00,100 --> 01:39:41,750
Is the goal to make it one unit or just have them all connected to each other? I can

315
01:39:42,310 --> 01:39:50,310
bring them to the front. Oh my goodness. Wait a minute. Okay. Hold on. This, everything changes

316
01:39:50,310 --> 01:40:59,779
now. This is fucked. Mayo on the left. Here? Then where does this go? There's a worst stream.

317
01:40:59,779 --> 01:41:05,380
You're not talking. Every stream I'm supposed to scream into the microphone as loud as I can.

318
01:41:05,380 --> 01:41:46,140
Is that what you want me to do? Chill stream. Relax. I'm stumped. I actually don't. I actually

319
01:41:46,140 --> 01:41:52,920
don't know what the hell to do. Somebody said, bro, close the fridge. You're just sitting there

320
01:41:52,920 --> 01:42:00,460
like dragging the mayo, then the wine and the milk. Like, dude, you need to close the fridge

321
01:42:00,460 --> 01:42:08,939
and you need to chill out. I get what it wants me to do, but I don't get what it wants me to do.

322
01:42:08,939 --> 01:42:14,220
Does that make any sense? I have to do this like piece by piece. All right. Because it's like,

323
01:42:16,300 --> 01:42:25,060
this is gray. This is gray, right at the bottom. This is gray, but this connects to the yellow

324
01:42:25,060 --> 01:42:51,689
part here. Spread them out in a line. Okay. So this line lines up with this line, right? Yeah.

325
01:42:51,689 --> 01:43:05,420
Okay. This line lines with this line, but it's the wrong color. Mayo goes on the left side.

326
01:43:05,420 --> 01:43:24,329
I mean, like over here. So is this bait? This has to be like this, right? Or is this here just for

327
01:43:24,329 --> 01:43:53,300
this? The milk goes behind the mayo like that. Then where does this go? Mayo. Holy shit. The

328
01:43:53,300 --> 01:44:13,130
milk and the mayo. There are no overlaps. What do you mean that? How is that possible? No,

329
01:44:13,130 --> 01:44:31,180
don't overlap. No overlapping. The patterns just connect. Where? You need to place them next to

330
01:44:31,180 --> 01:44:33,979
one on top of each other where the patterns line up. Yeah, that's what I'm trying to do.

331
01:44:33,979 --> 01:44:46,380
But like this pattern is not complete. You know what I mean? Right here, this pattern is not

332
01:44:46,380 --> 01:45:02,810
complete and I don't know how to complete it like this. Wait, that doesn't make any sense though.

333
01:45:02,810 --> 01:45:18,260
No, this is wrong. This is still wrong. I don't get it. I'm about to quit. I'm about to quit

334
01:45:18,260 --> 01:46:13,989
and play a different game. What the fuck? No overlapping. Milk next to mayo. I don't understand.

335
01:46:13,989 --> 01:46:22,180
Let's do a go play Super Mario Brothers. All right, here's what we're going to do. All you

336
01:46:22,180 --> 01:46:28,729
brilliant chat players. I'm going to drag this and you tell me when to stop. No, that's not going to

337
01:46:28,729 --> 01:46:41,899
help. Look at the shadows. What do you mean there's no shadows? Mayo. There are multiple

338
01:46:41,899 --> 01:46:46,140
patterns that have to be lined up. You notice the milk into the wine. The mayo goes into the milk.

339
01:46:46,140 --> 01:46:57,180
Yeah, but like some of these don't add up though. You know what I mean? Like is it just to be

340
01:46:57,180 --> 01:47:06,779
touching? They just have to touch this? Like is it just aligning the squares and shit?

341
01:47:06,779 --> 01:47:20,260
Is that that can't, that cannot be what it is. That, that actually cannot be what it is.

342
01:47:20,260 --> 01:47:32,470
I, there's no way. No, this can't be. It actually can't be. I'm trying to like connect to everything

343
01:47:32,470 --> 01:48:09,289
so it's a one lap. There's no way. It can't be. No, it actually can't be. Is that not it? I feel

344
01:48:09,289 --> 01:48:19,060
like this is so close. This is not it. No overlapping, but it's, it is aesthetically

345
01:48:19,060 --> 01:49:01,430
pleasing to me. What are you talking about? Why? You've got to be kidding me. There's no way.

346
01:49:01,430 --> 01:49:06,069
It's just pattern. I thought it was like match everything and like connect all the dots and like

347
01:49:06,069 --> 01:49:22,710
the colors all combined into one amalgamous image. I, no, you've got to be kidding me.

348
01:49:22,710 --> 01:49:34,260
Way overthinking it. I thought it was going to turn into a different picture. Well, like connect

349
01:49:34,260 --> 01:49:44,890
all the, why was all the squiggly lines there? They were just labels, bro. They were just labels.

350
01:49:44,890 --> 01:49:52,680
They're not supposed to be anything. I'm connecting a big, but we, the first part of the game,

351
01:49:52,680 --> 01:50:04,649
it had all the squiggly lines that you connected together. Let's see what happened here. Cat got

352
01:50:04,649 --> 01:50:17,079
up on the shelf. Cat knocks over vase, breaks the vase. Person that's sitting on the couch just goes,

353
01:50:17,079 --> 01:50:43,500
holy shit freaks out, knocks their wine over. Wait, that's not a vase? I feel like these pictures

354
01:50:43,739 --> 01:51:01,340
aren't connected to each other. This seems the most accurate to me. Or is it like, oh, look,

355
01:51:01,340 --> 01:51:11,100
the cat is kind of plotting. The cat's plotting. The cat touches stuff sometimes. And this time,

356
01:51:11,100 --> 01:51:14,300
yeah, like sometimes the cat looks at stuff. Sometimes the cat touches stuff. The cat touched

357
01:51:14,300 --> 01:52:02,579
this vase, smashed it. And then that happens somehow. Is it by color? All right. Without

358
01:52:02,579 --> 01:52:18,630
overthinking it, what am I, what am I looking at here? Cat knocks that down. Cat knocks this

359
01:52:18,630 --> 01:52:27,189
down. Cat breaks this. The cat is knocking all this stuff over. And this is just the cat looking

360
01:52:27,189 --> 01:52:37,770
at an object. This is the cat starting to play with an object. So does it need to be in a weird

361
01:52:37,770 --> 01:53:10,279
order? Or is this, is this it? Do I just have it? I know I had, I just did it in a weird, I think

362
01:53:10,279 --> 01:53:50,699
this is where I'm going to move on to a different game. More squiggly line bullshit. I think they're

363
01:53:50,699 --> 01:54:13,850
supposed to fit into each other. You know what I mean? Like fit into each other. What does this

364
01:54:13,850 --> 01:54:32,539
one fit into? That? How blind are you? As every one of these puzzles has had squiggly lines, it's

365
01:54:32,539 --> 01:55:11,180
had different colors, it's had different shapes. I mean, I have this, but what can connect to the,

366
01:55:11,180 --> 01:55:51,020
this has to be the end, right? And nothing else can go there. What am I missing here? What am I

367
01:55:51,020 --> 01:56:09,579
missing? I'm looking over at the mod chat and it's, everybody's doing this in the mod chat.

368
01:56:09,579 --> 01:56:28,470
They're posting Soprano gifs. What are you guys talking about? What are you guys talking about

369
01:56:28,470 --> 01:56:40,090
over here? Sorry. We're currently Soprano posting. Is somebody watching it? No, watch my stream.

370
01:56:40,890 --> 01:57:06,899
Excuse me. Discussing an episode. All right, now you know it's time. I got to move on to a new game.

371
01:57:08,279 --> 01:57:21,399
When the mods are discussing an episode of the Sopranos. That's actually fucking hilarious.

372
01:57:21,399 --> 01:57:40,550
All right, so what's, what's going on here? This is so close yet so far. Wrong. This has to be in

373
01:57:40,550 --> 01:57:47,750
between, right? What is happening? That's not correct. It has to be. What's wrong?

374
01:57:47,750 --> 01:58:08,579
Wrong. Sponge has to go in the bucket. Sponge in between three and four.

375
01:58:17,850 --> 01:58:31,539
Sponge what? Sponge red bottle. There's a nice rectangle there.

376
01:58:33,750 --> 01:58:52,619
I would think we'd match up with the green. There's a rectangle gap. Move it up higher. I,

377
01:58:52,619 --> 01:59:01,939
oh my god. I just accidentally did that. What kind of a sponge sits up like that?

378
01:59:21,529 --> 01:59:25,529
Oh my god. This is going to be impossible. Get out of here. Get out. Get out. Get out.

379
01:59:25,529 --> 01:59:41,270
Can I get out? I'm not going to be. This is impossible. Hold on. Hold on. Let me just get

380
01:59:41,270 --> 02:01:43,739
them all in here. I actually like this one. That was, I love that one. That one was awesome. That

381
02:01:43,739 --> 02:01:53,500
one was really fun too. Oh, I'm going to love this one. These, they get, they're getting better.

382
02:01:53,500 --> 02:01:57,460
They're actually getting so much more fun. I can't wait to do this one. I'm not even kidding.

383
02:02:28,859 --> 02:03:42,229
Yes. Now I just got to get it ready. Why is it doing that? Get in there. What do you mean?

384
02:03:42,229 --> 02:04:09,529
Why can't these fit? And that is a perfect draw. This is perfect. What's wrong with this?

385
02:04:09,529 --> 02:04:20,899
Does anybody else take all their clean silverware? Pick it all up in a gigantic tube in your hand.

386
02:04:20,899 --> 02:04:32,100
Open up the silverware drawer and just drop it all in. No, I don't do that either.

387
02:04:32,100 --> 02:04:41,430
I'm just trying to catch people that do. It's just magic's already opening up the drawer.

388
02:04:41,430 --> 02:04:55,640
Just dump it. That would be such a mess. Stack them up. I can't turn them. I can't stack them.

389
02:04:55,640 --> 02:05:04,859
It doesn't want, it won't let me turn it. They're just, oh wait, I get it. I thought it was supposed

390
02:05:04,859 --> 02:05:37,829
to be inside. See these, these are going much smoother now. Oh dear. Oh dear. Actually,

391
02:05:37,829 --> 02:06:09,270
this is not as bad as I thought it was going to be. Light bulb stream, light bulb tier list.

392
02:06:09,270 --> 02:07:17,079
No, there we go. Hmm. Thank you. Oh dear. Oh, this one's going to be bad. I just got to focus.

393
02:07:18,039 --> 02:07:27,529
The scissors have to go away. Getting the scissors in is a big deal. Get all the big

394
02:07:27,529 --> 02:07:37,300
goofy objects in first. Like this is a big goofy object and it goes right here. Is that all right?

395
02:07:37,300 --> 02:07:45,720
Any more big goofy objects? Yep. Pen has to go lengthwise. Okay. Yep. Big goofy object up here.

396
02:07:51,619 --> 02:08:06,949
This also is lengthwise. It's going to go here. Big goofy pen. Hmm. What about this weird thing?

397
02:08:06,949 --> 02:08:30,310
All right. Where does this go? Perfect. Glasses over here. Oh yeah. Actually, no, not quite.

398
02:08:30,310 --> 02:09:25,050
This is not fit. Proprietary fondue fork, by the way. What is this shape? Something is oddly

399
02:09:25,050 --> 02:09:52,680
shaped like this. What is it? What has that weird shape? Now it's a bunch of miscellaneous

400
02:09:52,680 --> 02:10:38,100
bullshit. There you go. A bunch of miscellaneous shit can go in here. Okay. Wait, there's more.

401
02:10:38,100 --> 02:11:29,909
Perfect. Not quite, but I'll fix it. That's fine. Whatever. It fits. It's fine. Almost done. There

402
02:11:29,909 --> 02:12:59,720
it is. Shit. Give me the ding. I'll take a ding right now. What's wrong? Oh, all right. I got it.

403
02:12:59,720 --> 02:13:52,520
This is fun. I like it when they just put things in boxes and not shit. What? How did I get it?

404
02:13:52,520 --> 02:14:23,930
Got it. There's no orange. It was leaking from. Oh, okay. Oh, this is going to be a good one.

405
02:14:23,930 --> 02:15:03,270
I don't know what to do. The big ones go in the middle, maybe? Like stack. Thank you. We got a

406
02:15:03,270 --> 02:15:08,840
raid. Hey, Hazer. Thanks for the raid. Welcome. I don't know. Was that like a two hours ago?

407
02:15:08,840 --> 02:15:13,880
Thanks for the raid, though. We've got a good stream. We're just chilling out today.

408
02:15:13,880 --> 02:15:40,359
Let's hang out stream. One, two, three, four. I mean, this is five, but is that what they want

409
02:15:40,359 --> 02:16:19,350
me to do? What do I need to stack them? Another raid song? Oh, no, I did it. I did it. It's one,

410
02:16:19,350 --> 02:16:28,729
two, three. Yeah, I was thinking one, two, three, one, two, three, four. Well, that's not four.

411
02:16:28,729 --> 02:16:43,110
This is one, two. This is a lot, isn't it? It's just by the holes, technically. Seven, one, two,

412
02:16:43,110 --> 02:16:52,760
three, four. Yeah. So one, two, three, four, five. I wonder if I have to stack them. Oh, shit. Okay.

413
02:16:52,760 --> 02:17:24,459
Hold on. One, two. It's technically three. Wait, are you sure I'm counting the wrong thing? It's

414
02:17:24,459 --> 02:17:29,340
one, two, three, technically. One, two, three. Somebody said I was counting the wrong thing.

415
02:17:29,340 --> 02:18:48,870
How do I get it to stand straight up? I think that this one's in the right spot, I think.

416
02:18:48,870 --> 02:19:01,989
What does this one even tell me? Teeth at the end are numbers. Seven. Honestly, that would have taken

417
02:19:01,989 --> 02:19:08,229
me a very long time because I'm sitting here counting how many prongs there are, not the

418
02:19:08,229 --> 02:19:29,719
number it looks like. What is that, a five? So this is three, three, four, five, seven. Hold on.

419
02:19:29,719 --> 02:19:42,180
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. What is this? One, two, three, six.

420
02:19:48,969 --> 02:19:58,870
Six. I love how you ask a question and then swivel around in your chair waiting for the answer like

421
02:19:58,870 --> 02:20:29,479
Dora the Explorer. Waiting for the answer. Is it six? It's six. Come on. These get tricky.

422
02:20:29,479 --> 02:20:38,709
You gotta, come on, this must be a kill day. No, I'm good. I like, these are my favorite ones.

423
02:20:38,709 --> 02:21:34,680
I love these ones. These are the best. Okay. I don't, this is not right. That's okay. Also not

424
02:21:34,680 --> 02:22:06,020
right, but it's all right. Over here maybe. It's a weird shape. This shit is weird. Uh, wait a minute.

425
02:22:06,020 --> 02:23:38,340
I think that's correct. Golden tooth? Wrong. Got it. What goes over here? How can you not see it?

426
02:23:38,340 --> 02:25:09,579
Nothing's wrong over here. What's wrong? What's wrong? Yeah. What's, what's going on?

427
02:25:09,579 --> 02:25:43,930
Bottom left? What's wrong with it? The nuts? Swap the bolts. Swap the fucking bolts. Swap the

428
02:25:43,930 --> 02:25:56,940
fucking bolts. Oh my God. I'm like hyperventilating. Imagine looking at a draw of tools

429
02:25:56,940 --> 02:26:04,649
and it's not even, I'm just sitting here going, I need to slow down. Swap. All right. Is it weird

430
02:26:04,649 --> 02:26:13,319
that I don't know what a nut and a bolt is? You gotta call this what they look like. The little

431
02:26:13,319 --> 02:26:20,069
spinny things that fall off the trees. Is that what you mean? The little spinny things that

432
02:26:20,069 --> 02:26:30,659
fall off the tree. That's a wing nut. Okay. This is a bolt and you want me to move the bolts over

433
02:26:30,659 --> 02:26:41,770
here? Bolt is like Frankenstein, right? These are Frankenstein bolts. What is it? Is it nuts? Is it

434
02:26:41,770 --> 02:26:52,260
Frankenstein nuts? What do Frankenstein's nuts look like? I know. They look like this, right?

435
02:26:55,059 --> 02:26:59,139
I know. As it was coming out, I knew what was happening, but like what do they look like?

436
02:27:00,020 --> 02:27:09,770
They're like this, right? What? Just tell me what you want me to do. How does that sound?

437
02:27:09,770 --> 02:27:26,569
Like this? I don't, guys, what is in bolt? What do you mean? Okay. Bottom left. You mean these

438
02:27:27,690 --> 02:27:43,049
alternate the bolts. There's only one bolt. I did that already. What's this? What's the problem? I

439
02:27:43,049 --> 02:27:56,340
did it already. I wasn't that already like that has to be fucking with us. Oh no, this is going

440
02:27:56,340 --> 02:28:07,270
to be one of these where I have to make a picture. I'm addicted to this game now. I thought I was

441
02:28:07,270 --> 02:28:37,290
going to give up. I like love it. Hold on. So the labels don't mean anything. What are you guys

442
02:28:37,290 --> 02:28:48,969
putting a fish in here? Oh, I gave chat a fish to help them calm down. That scene was fucking crazy.

443
02:28:48,969 --> 02:29:32,250
You guys think Tony? All right. I can't move this. Can this hang somewhere? I don't think

444
02:29:32,250 --> 02:30:17,049
that's right. Oh, wait a minute. Oh, please do it. Jeremy, please do it. It's 2023. No one's angry.

445
02:30:17,049 --> 02:30:25,190
Are you not angry? We're just hanging out. You can just chill out. No one's angry. Who's angry?

446
02:30:25,190 --> 02:30:47,930
It's great. We're fuming. No, you're not. You're not angry. You're not actually angry. You're not.

447
02:30:48,010 --> 02:31:12,940
I know you're not. What are we doing with all these Q-tips? Oh, I know what to do with the Q-tips.

448
02:31:12,940 --> 02:31:28,659
You were gaslighting us. No, I wasn't. Why are these not going in? Who's angry? No, I'm not angry.

449
02:31:28,659 --> 02:32:11,979
It's okay. Does this fit in here? I don't get it. I can't put it in. It doesn't go in here.

450
02:32:11,979 --> 02:33:13,829
I don't understand what to do with the brush. Slow down and think. I would hang this on a little hook.

451
02:33:13,829 --> 02:33:27,620
And what is this thing? Is this a flosser? Wouldn't it go in here? Can anything else fit in this?

452
02:33:27,620 --> 02:33:39,239
Probably not, right? This brush doesn't go anywhere. Brush goes in your pocket.

453
02:33:53,540 --> 02:35:11,770
But where does the floss go, then? Right there. I can't spin it, though. Yay. Oh, wait a minute.

454
02:35:11,770 --> 02:36:06,819
I know. I got it. Oh, boy. This is going to be a challenge, but I'm up for it. No, please. God,

455
02:36:06,819 --> 02:36:17,370
no. I don't think you guys have not entered the chill zone yet. You guys have not entered

456
02:36:17,370 --> 02:36:23,030
the chill zone. I don't think I've ever heard of somebody chilling out and screaming,

457
02:36:23,030 --> 02:36:32,819
oh, God, please, God, no. I don't see you chilling out and hanging out with the hot cocoa. Oh, God,

458
02:36:32,819 --> 02:37:03,190
please, God, no. Wow, I'm so comfy. Oh, God, please, God. You need to relax. This game is too

459
02:37:03,190 --> 02:37:12,360
stressful. No, it's not. This is a chill game. We're just chilling. All right, let's run a poll.

460
02:37:12,360 --> 02:37:22,020
Mods, get a poll in the chat. Are you chilling out or oh, God, please, God? No. What does this

461
02:37:22,020 --> 02:37:36,010
say? What did you make the title? The triangle block goes into the square. What? Sipping my,

462
02:37:36,010 --> 02:37:48,860
I'm chilling out or oh, God, please, God? Yeah. It's not 70% of you that are freaking out. You

463
02:37:48,860 --> 02:38:05,299
guys, we just, we're, we gotta chill. God, please, God. I just dropped the hammer. Are you guys

464
02:38:05,299 --> 02:38:32,180
stressing out? Oh, my. Chilling. I'm stressing out. I'm confused. You're stressing them out.

465
02:38:32,180 --> 02:38:47,610
This game gives me anxiety. I want to change my answer. You can't. Big dumb stuff first. Wait,

466
02:38:47,610 --> 02:39:04,709
I can knock everything off. Okay, this has to hang between some. All right, I think that's

467
02:39:04,709 --> 02:39:23,420
actually a good place for it. This definitely goes here. This might go right here. I'm so

468
02:39:23,420 --> 02:39:57,909
chilled out right now. I just lost connection to chat. No, is that all right? Please, God.

469
02:40:04,020 --> 02:40:10,340
You say that when you go on a really scary roller coaster. There's always somebody that's

470
02:40:10,340 --> 02:40:15,159
for some reason, they decided to sit in the front seat. Like, don't sit in the front seat.

471
02:40:15,159 --> 02:40:20,520
And they're like, oh, gosh, please, God, make sure we get through this. You don't, don't sit in the

472
02:40:20,520 --> 02:40:43,510
front car. 60, 40. Yeah, but you gotta take, you gotta take like 20 to 30% away from the memers,

473
02:40:43,510 --> 02:40:48,520
right? Yeah, I gotta take, you gotta take 20% of the way because they just clicked it because

474
02:40:48,520 --> 02:41:31,979
they thought it was a funny sentence. Oh, okay. Hold on. How am I supposed to fit this? I was fine

475
02:41:31,979 --> 02:42:44,010
until this level. I'm making progress. Don't act like I'm not making progress. Oh, God.

476
02:42:46,180 --> 02:42:56,840
Don't do this to me. You just get up and go get a bowl of Captain Crunch and be fine.

477
02:43:02,440 --> 02:43:34,780
Dude, I'm like tied to a chair. You just got me. I can't get out. Shit, this is so tricky.

478
02:43:34,780 --> 02:44:21,059
I'm, how could I, this is so tricky. Fucking stop doing that. I'm, I, I, I, I, I'm, you know

479
02:44:21,059 --> 02:44:47,819
what I mean? I'm getting there. A 10 year old could do this. Oh, stop it. Oh, they could not.

480
02:44:47,819 --> 02:44:59,379
I'm close to wherever it is. That's where that goes for sure. It's so close. It really is. Don't

481
02:44:59,379 --> 02:45:45,989
tell me it's not because it is. The broom go up here. All the, all the people that are doubters,

482
02:45:45,989 --> 02:46:23,340
you're about to lose big time. Shut up. That's correct. Yes, it is.

483
02:47:14,819 --> 02:47:19,340
He's never going to do this one. He's never going to do it. Should have done a poll.

484
02:47:19,340 --> 02:47:25,620
Why did we not do a poll? Every single one of you just lost. We should have done a poll.

485
02:47:25,620 --> 02:47:32,790
There's just a couple small things missing and it's good to go. It's just a few things missing

486
02:47:32,790 --> 02:47:39,719
that are a little bit incorrect. It's, oh, it's, oh, it's there though. What do you change? Stop

487
02:47:39,719 --> 02:47:46,340
changing my title. Dear Jerma, there are hints in the pause menu featuring the fishies within

488
02:47:46,340 --> 02:48:10,600
that little face. Why are you communicating this way? Why are you communicating through titles?

489
02:48:10,600 --> 02:48:17,940
There's something that's so close. Is it right here? Did I just get it? Oh yeah. I win. Where's

490
02:48:17,940 --> 02:48:43,379
wait, something's missing. Where does this go? This one stupid thing, but I don't know. Something

491
02:48:43,379 --> 02:49:16,440
has to change. Where's this broom go? Over here. I got it. Done. Hey doubters. Good night. Let's go.

492
02:49:16,440 --> 02:49:43,290
What's wrong? It's the angle. No, this definitely goes here. Where else would that go? There. Okay.

493
02:49:43,290 --> 02:50:14,139
There it is. Done. Yeah. See you later doubters. How would this be wrong? There's no way this is,

494
02:50:14,139 --> 02:50:47,819
this is correct. Where else would any of this go? Doubters are winning. The wrench, the wrench needs

495
02:50:47,819 --> 02:51:12,379
to be switched with something. There's no hole. That would make sense here. The yellow pick thing.

496
02:51:12,379 --> 02:51:44,149
That is. See you later. All right. We got an easy cookies one. I don't even know what I just did.

497
02:51:44,149 --> 02:52:18,440
It's betting time. Will I do this in 20 minutes? Will I get the ding in 20 minutes? Is that too

498
02:52:18,440 --> 02:52:24,840
long or should I do 15? Too long. 15. Mod check. Why are you checking? Oh, it's because people

499
02:52:24,840 --> 02:52:33,940
are doing the fish. 15 minutes or less? No, no way. 10. 10 is this. These games are designed for

500
02:52:33,940 --> 02:52:46,459
you to play them for like 40 minutes. 15 minutes. Will I solve this in 15 minutes and put it in emote

501
02:52:46,459 --> 02:53:04,870
only? Oh, you've been playing this for hours. Yeah. I'm having fun. I mean, contrary to maybe

502
02:53:04,870 --> 02:53:09,829
some of your beliefs, this game is not the equivalent of me dunking my head in acid.

503
02:53:09,829 --> 02:53:25,379
I'm having some... Wait, timer's going? No, it's not. It has to wait to wait till people bet.

504
02:53:25,379 --> 02:53:32,729
No, timer's not going until it's... There's a lot of yeses. Is that a lot of yeses or a lot of noes?

505
02:53:32,729 --> 02:53:49,770
That's a lot of yeses. A lot of you believe. Can we help with emote only? You can try. 30 million

506
02:53:49,770 --> 02:54:08,979
versus 16 million. Well, a lot of believers. You ready? Tell me when to go. Mods are keeping

507
02:54:08,979 --> 02:54:38,760
track right now. Economic collapse incoming. Okay. Wait, not yet. I want my own music. I want my own

508
02:54:38,760 --> 02:54:55,819
music for this. I'm not going yet. No, no, no, no, no, no. No, I'm not going yet. I need my own music.

509
02:54:55,819 --> 02:55:03,379
I haven't looked. I want my own music. What should we do for our music? How about like... What am I

510
02:55:03,379 --> 02:55:12,040
feeling? Something that's going to make me concentrate. Both headphones going in. Reset the

511
02:55:12,040 --> 02:55:35,180
level. Okay. That's fair. I'm not looking. No, not Miku. The Bloodborne OST. Oh, the misery. I mean,

512
02:55:35,180 --> 02:55:39,270
this is... That's going to get muted. Do you think I can do it in the time that we listen to, oh,

513
02:55:39,270 --> 02:55:53,459
the misery? I'm just going to get muted. Is it worth it? What if it gets shut down? It's not

514
02:55:53,459 --> 02:56:05,459
worth it. No, not doom. Something that's going to lock me in. The Flintstones? What on the karaoke

515
02:56:05,459 --> 02:56:31,129
version? The karaoke version is just going to be... What? Hold on. Karaoke version. What does this

516
02:56:31,129 --> 02:57:11,110
actually sound like? Put on the MIDI version? It's just... It's not... But is it just this?

517
02:57:11,750 --> 02:57:37,579
This is... No, it's not. I need to sing it. If I sing this, will... Okay, will you guys be happy?

518
02:57:40,280 --> 02:57:43,319
Should I just do this? Like, should I just fuck this game and I'm just going to do this for like a

519
02:57:43,319 --> 02:57:56,139
minute? All right, I'll try. If I get through this, if I get through the first verse, I get another

520
02:57:56,139 --> 02:58:14,809
two minutes. No, that's not fair. 15. All right, here we go. I'm going to try doing this. I don't

521
02:58:14,809 --> 02:58:17,610
even know how it goes.

522
02:58:47,739 --> 02:59:04,280
I even have the lyrics in front of me. The lyrics are in front of me and I still said it wrong.

523
02:59:04,280 --> 02:59:10,729
You got to be fucking kidding me. I've said it wrong so many times that that's the right way.

524
02:59:14,020 --> 02:59:23,420
Keep going. You just want to embarrass me even more in front of a hundred billion people? I have

525
02:59:23,420 --> 02:59:26,069
to get at least the chorus and I'm done. I promise.

526
02:59:41,639 --> 02:59:46,440
You, you're the great... They do that thing with their mouth.

527
02:59:46,440 --> 02:59:55,100
But once you turn, they hate us. Oh, the misery.

528
02:59:56,059 --> 03:00:05,129
Everybody wants to be my enemy. Spare the sympathy. Everybody wants to be my enemy.

529
03:00:05,290 --> 03:00:24,780
They, they, they, they. Once you pray, oh the misery, every single laughter in the halls I stack it in

530
03:00:24,780 --> 03:00:29,819
my mind and waiting for the time when I show you what it's like to be the world's Spirit of Mike.

531
03:00:30,700 --> 03:00:40,950
Tell you you're the greatestest. But once you turn they hate us.

532
03:00:41,590 --> 03:00:47,459
Oh the misery every single person is my

533
03:00:49,540 --> 03:00:51,540
Spare the sympathy

534
03:00:52,260 --> 03:00:54,860
Everybody wants to be my enemy

535
03:00:55,860 --> 03:01:10,889
How does it actually go?

536
03:01:11,770 --> 03:01:13,940
That is how it goes. Oh

537
03:01:24,940 --> 03:01:27,379
That's it doesn't goes like ee-ee-ee-ee

538
03:01:27,940 --> 03:01:43,250
Yeah, I fucked it up. What doesn't matter my version hurt. So my version hurt you. All right, let's go

539
03:01:43,250 --> 03:01:56,270
Oh, wait, this must be a timer. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait

540
03:01:56,270 --> 03:02:12,100
I needed to actual OST. I don't know. What should I put on this?

541
03:02:14,540 --> 03:02:25,620
Restart, please. All right. I need I need songs. Hold on. How about like thinking music thinking music to inspire creativity

542
03:02:26,799 --> 03:02:46,139
Positive thinking music for work and for studying. I think that sounds good. All right. All right, ready ready

543
03:02:46,500 --> 03:02:54,229
Tell me when to go ready one two

544
03:02:55,190 --> 03:03:18,950
Go

545
03:03:18,950 --> 03:03:49,709
You all just got absolutely fucking annihilated

546
03:03:51,110 --> 03:03:53,430
Annihilated so many people lost points

547
03:03:55,030 --> 03:03:57,459
Wait, that's not it

548
03:03:59,780 --> 03:04:02,469
Wait what

549
03:04:03,489 --> 03:04:20,409
That's not is it the end. Oh, that was it. All right, I went you guys so some of you guys got absolutely annihilated

550
03:04:20,409 --> 03:04:21,530
I'm so sorry

551
03:04:21,530 --> 03:04:24,469
That was so easy

552
03:04:24,469 --> 03:04:40,489
Here's another one. Here's your chance. Well, I solve this one in 15 minutes

553
03:04:48,129 --> 03:04:57,010
That probably sounded so bad

554
03:04:57,010 --> 03:05:04,950
15 is too long. What are you linking here?

555
03:05:14,809 --> 03:05:20,260
Oh the misery every single person is my

556
03:05:22,340 --> 03:05:24,340
Spare the sympathy

557
03:05:25,059 --> 03:05:34,500
Everybody that is the I just did this while you're linking this to me. All right

558
03:05:34,500 --> 03:05:39,379
A lot of you guys think yes, it's my people are gonna get fucking annihilated on this one

559
03:05:39,540 --> 03:05:50,899
What if this one is super easy? I don't know. It's I don't I don't know what this is asking me to do

560
03:05:50,899 --> 03:05:55,940
I'm just gonna go for it put on blood-borne. All right, I'll put on I'll put on

561
03:05:56,700 --> 03:06:00,159
how about the

562
03:06:00,239 --> 03:06:18,260
Ludwig theme that's like my favorite song. All right, this this is literally seven minutes. So it's got time

563
03:06:18,739 --> 03:06:30,180
15 minutes is way too much time. All right, well then just bet accordingly then you need to bet accordingly

564
03:06:30,180 --> 03:06:40,559
I'm not gonna tell you what you shouldn't shouldn't bet on. I'm just saying a bet. All right, are we ready?

565
03:06:45,739 --> 03:06:54,379
Let's go for it. Okay in three

566
03:06:54,940 --> 03:06:57,819
Two one go. Oh

567
03:07:10,270 --> 03:07:20,540
That actually really hurt. Oh my fucking elbow my bleeding I

568
03:07:20,540 --> 03:11:51,739
Just wanted to hear the breakdown hmm, this one looks easy

569
03:12:10,510 --> 03:12:15,520
Hey, pretty good at that noise heard it 500 times. Oh

570
03:12:20,790 --> 03:12:24,950
Pog he did the like thing where he goes like this and makes a noise that it like he's I

571
03:12:50,549 --> 03:12:59,760
Actually don't think this one will be that bad. Wait a minute. Maybe it is. No, I don't think it'll be bad

572
03:12:59,760 --> 03:13:01,479
I don't think you want to bet on this one

573
03:13:01,479 --> 03:13:11,920
I don't think you should bet because this is really just finding with ease fit like for instance right here

574
03:13:12,719 --> 03:13:18,659
Yeah, I don't think you should bet. Well, he's off in five minutes

575
03:13:21,340 --> 03:13:27,430
Under five. Okay. I mean if you get up if you want to do it then go for it

576
03:13:27,430 --> 03:13:56,739
But I'm telling you it's probably better do all in. Oh, no all in you suck. Is that what you said?

577
03:13:56,739 --> 03:14:00,190
No, it's not. What did you say?

578
03:14:04,459 --> 03:14:21,540
Oh, let him cook. I read that his you suck. How I don't think it's just moving pretty fast. All right. Are we good?

579
03:14:22,420 --> 03:14:31,979
Ready to get started. I don't think I'm gonna do music for this one. So when I pick up the first piece

580
03:14:31,979 --> 03:14:35,350
That's when you can start the timer. Maybe I'll do a little bit of music. Why not?

581
03:14:50,180 --> 03:15:01,450
There's less than five minutes reset it. I just did didn't I? I just did how about um

582
03:15:02,250 --> 03:15:14,739
Do penis music now too many people here too many people will leave the Elden Ring theme

583
03:15:17,110 --> 03:15:29,829
Okay. Yeah, this is almost this is five minutes long. Here we go. Ready. This is the right one. Yeah, it is. Okay

584
03:15:29,829 --> 03:15:37,030
Here we go. Ready three two one

585
03:15:39,600 --> 03:18:38,399
I'm gonna pee I'll be right back

586
03:18:38,399 --> 03:19:26,020
But why did I that was weird face? I just made he is so funny. Yeah, that's the wicked funny

587
03:19:26,020 --> 03:19:47,629
We just did what am I grabbing here? There's the audio. Oh, okay. I follow in the footprints

588
03:19:47,629 --> 03:20:13,670
I think so turn on music. I will in just a second. All right. This one looks a little tricky

589
03:20:13,950 --> 03:20:18,659
This one actually looks pretty tricky. I'm not gonna look too much at it

590
03:20:18,659 --> 03:20:20,059
I'm just gonna well now I can't do that

591
03:20:20,059 --> 03:20:36,149
Are you guys done losing all your points or do you want to keep going more solve it within five minutes?

592
03:20:36,989 --> 03:20:44,639
That's this a lot of you are gonna either make a lot of money or lose a lot of money in relative channel point terms

593
03:20:44,899 --> 03:20:56,549
This is the start of this level. So I'm gonna start here and I am gonna make sure I'm focusing

594
03:21:01,110 --> 03:21:31,530
It's not gonna be music. We're gonna do thunderstorm sounds to make sure I'm locked in I put 5k

595
03:21:34,569 --> 03:21:51,260
13 million more than that 16 million. Yes 6 million say no as of right now five minutes

596
03:21:51,260 --> 03:22:18,809
I don't know that one looked a little weird. Are we good? I'm gonna put both headphones in I'm gonna relax

597
03:22:20,139 --> 03:22:21,600
thunderstorm

598
03:22:21,600 --> 03:22:31,399
Sound effects because this will help ready three two

599
03:22:32,000 --> 03:23:29,090
One start it's not it's not over

600
03:23:29,729 --> 03:23:52,959
Stop doing that. Stop. I don't know what to do. I don't get it

601
03:23:55,180 --> 03:24:44,540
Shit, okay. That one was very easy. I thought that was the lightning. Wait, wait, wait. Are we starting? Oh, we're starting

602
03:24:44,540 --> 03:24:47,360
Okay, I alright

603
03:24:47,479 --> 03:24:50,809
Rain's getting kind of wild out there

604
03:24:50,850 --> 03:25:26,620
If this is this much going on, I would not be live. I would just I don't know I'd be like scared

605
03:25:36,340 --> 03:25:53,579
Holy shit, dude. Turn your stream off. Just we'll see you tomorrow, man

606
03:25:54,000 --> 03:26:28,030
We'll see you tomorrow. You don't have to do this. All right, we good. Are you good to go? All right

607
03:26:28,350 --> 03:26:38,590
Let me reset it three two one go

608
03:27:33,100 --> 03:27:59,670
Turn that off god damn it. I don't understand what it wants me to do

609
03:27:59,670 --> 03:28:22,020
There's gotta be some kind of pattern to this like you can't you gotta take one and then from the opposite one maybe

610
03:28:29,260 --> 03:29:19,500
Jesus, I don't understand. Oh one two, three, four five one, two, three, four one one

611
03:29:19,899 --> 03:29:24,329
One one one two three one two one

612
03:29:24,370 --> 03:29:38,790
One this is the only this one has one one this one also has one so daisy this one has one this one has

613
03:29:42,190 --> 03:29:44,069
Maybe delete these

614
03:29:44,069 --> 03:31:08,180
Did you I don't I haven't I haven't figured it out yet. I did something right there, though

615
03:31:08,379 --> 03:31:17,299
Maybe every other one needs to be pulled. Maybe there has to be one on each trunk. I

616
03:31:18,620 --> 03:31:54,889
I don't know. I don't know. I don't get it. I'm sorry everybody. I was up. What am I doing wrong?

617
03:31:54,930 --> 03:32:35,690
What did I do wrong? I don't understand. I think it's a mirror mirror symmetry make it symmetrical. What do you mean?

618
03:32:35,690 --> 03:32:56,739
Oh really shit. Okay. Wait, what that's symmetrical. This is not so this is symmetrical. This doesn't belong here

619
03:32:57,579 --> 03:33:15,110
Understand it's just mirrored. This is mirrored except this shouldn't be here and down here. This is wrong

620
03:33:15,389 --> 03:33:25,159
This can't be mirrored. The only way this can be mirrored is if I get rid of these all of these essentially, right this one

621
03:33:25,799 --> 03:33:31,860
This one then

622
03:33:32,059 --> 03:33:55,690
This it right. Okay, we didn't I didn't win reset it. Well, did I already cut one off that I wasn't supposed to

623
03:34:00,879 --> 03:35:02,760
Okay. All right. This one was cool. I don't think that's right though

624
03:35:02,840 --> 03:35:38,229
No, it is because they want me to do here the lines probably do another pole. No, no, no, no, no

625
03:35:38,229 --> 03:36:21,969
No, don't ever overlap them. Isn't it a 33% chance that I just get this right eventually

626
03:36:22,290 --> 03:37:13,850
Yeah, there's a 33% chance that I eventually will get this right gems. That's wrong with that

627
03:37:13,850 --> 03:37:29,739
This looks pretty great to me do it by color. I'm trying to fit them together

628
03:37:30,139 --> 03:39:36,270
Got it. I can stack these should I not do that? No, what I don't know to do. Hey

629
03:39:36,709 --> 03:41:38,860
That's not it. I can't do symmetry with everything because I this one's

630
03:41:39,420 --> 03:41:53,250
It's no counterpart. Oh the symmetry

631
03:41:53,930 --> 03:42:22,950
These face in the wrong way. I think they were these are not in the right spot. I don't know why

632
03:42:23,510 --> 03:43:13,510
mirror each side

633
03:43:13,510 --> 03:43:20,860
Mean like what do you mean?

634
03:43:26,979 --> 03:44:34,579
The only thing cooking is his brain I kind of don't get it seems like everything seems to be in order

635
03:44:34,819 --> 03:44:46,350
Is everything not in order here? So you mean put one on like this?

636
03:44:46,350 --> 03:44:52,709
You mean like I'm gonna show you demonstrations mean like this. I have one object on each side just mirrored

637
03:44:52,709 --> 03:45:00,250
But what about this? I can't split these

638
03:45:52,450 --> 03:47:34,600
I'm gonna turn off the lightning. Will you stop doing that? Which the red and the black that looks pretty good. What's going on here?

639
03:47:35,600 --> 03:47:44,049
The cat is giving you hints. I think this looks good. I don't think there's anything wrong with this

640
03:47:44,770 --> 03:48:49,540
Had it in the wood. Are you streaming from your private island?

641
03:48:52,889 --> 03:49:02,549
Sounds are you filming?

642
03:49:09,670 --> 03:49:13,540
private island Andy the black shell ah

643
03:49:14,860 --> 03:49:47,819
What do you want? It's not helping. I don't know. It's my color. This does not help at all

644
03:49:47,819 --> 03:49:55,569
I did have a hint and then some kid got a hold of this fucking book and just started just

645
03:49:55,850 --> 03:50:36,120
Ruining it. Yeah, I'm doing that star has to go in the middle

646
03:50:36,639 --> 03:51:03,399
There are pieces overlapping did it. Oh

647
03:51:12,799 --> 03:51:14,959
dear dear me I

648
03:53:41,360 --> 03:54:08,100
Think I'm almost done with it with these things you have to seriously sit back and just like kind of let your eyes just

649
03:54:08,459 --> 03:54:31,780
Lose focus and just look at the whole thing whole sections, right? No put it back put it back put it

650
03:54:31,780 --> 03:55:45,620
Oh, this is awful. Wait, they could have grown back. They could have grown back on its own. There's only like one more. Where is it?

651
03:56:16,469 --> 03:56:27,620
I

652
03:56:27,620 --> 03:56:30,540
Did not expect it to be like that. I thought I've had it

653
03:56:30,540 --> 03:56:40,159
I thought I had it fine the sound effects are putting me to sleep. It was nice. Just use your eyes lol

654
03:56:40,159 --> 03:56:59,469
Hey one, two, three, one, two, three one, two, three, four one, two, three, four down from here one, two, three

655
03:56:59,469 --> 03:57:02,549
Four five down from here one, two, three, four five

656
03:57:03,069 --> 03:58:14,549
Six wait, that's on there put it down. No, I don't know where it grew back. What am I missing now?

657
03:58:14,629 --> 03:58:27,760
Two three four five down this one here. We got one three four five six seven eight nine one two

658
03:58:28,540 --> 03:58:30,540
You piece of shit

659
03:58:30,899 --> 03:59:05,899
Close it like it's over here somewhere. I feel like it's like right here. It definitely is where is it that?

660
03:59:09,350 --> 03:59:17,270
Mirrors that mirrors this mirrors this mirrors that does that does that one does this one does not

661
03:59:18,190 --> 03:59:26,020
Wait, no it does this one does this one does this one does this one does

662
03:59:26,819 --> 03:59:29,260

669
04:00:30,420 --> 04:00:37,260
We can't find it. You pulled the wrong ones off

670
04:00:37,860 --> 04:00:47,700

671
04:00:59,989 --> 04:01:26,159

04:01:54,020 --> 04:02:23,639
Six seven is one more. Yeah

674
04:02:24,239 --> 04:02:37,520
All right. Very good. Thank you for the help. I wonder how much there is left in the game. Oh, this is easy

675
04:02:37,639 --> 04:03:38,680
That was a good sound. Okay, what's happening here? These have eyes. I think I have to put stuff in the same

676
04:03:38,680 --> 04:04:39,319
I don't know. How does this work rocks go together? What's with the gold? Oh, there we go. Nice

677
04:04:39,319 --> 04:04:49,379
Let's see if I like this game. It's getting fun. I wish puts in music on I'll put the regular music on put it back on

678
04:04:49,459 --> 04:05:15,500
Ooh, this is nice and you beat this game. I mean I have to assume I'm getting I wonder how many chapters there are

679
04:05:15,500 --> 04:05:55,850
This is gonna be some mirror shit. I think so. It is another mirror only one of these. Oh shit

680
04:05:55,850 --> 04:06:03,450
It's two of them egg. Hey

681
04:06:06,180 --> 04:06:18,090
Hey, okay

682
04:06:18,090 --> 04:07:01,020
Okay, what's the issue? You look like you've aged 15 years from playing this what no

683
04:07:01,020 --> 04:07:17,959
I do not and how much cleaner does this need to be pretty good. You see do I do by color?

684
04:07:18,000 --> 04:07:51,989
This one's not a mirror pinecones. Oh, right. No, these definitely go here

685
04:07:51,989 --> 04:08:00,420
I think I have the top row done top row seems pretty good. Oh

686
04:08:10,600 --> 04:08:24,270
Whoops. Oh my goodness. Oh my goodness. Yeah, that was not good. That was bad. That was very bad

687
04:08:24,270 --> 04:08:37,500
How does this one work actually?

688
04:08:38,059 --> 04:08:44,129
demented

689
04:08:44,129 --> 04:08:56,540
Demented I very clearly this one is based on they probably have to be touching the right colors

690
04:08:58,219 --> 04:09:40,620
Like this. Mm-hmm. Stop doing that. I have it

691
04:09:40,620 --> 04:09:42,620
I need to

692
04:09:44,819 --> 04:10:48,129
That's not right you like that's pretty good

693
04:11:51,920 --> 04:12:16,870
Is the neat the two colors need to this needs to be red green green

694
04:12:17,549 --> 04:12:18,510
orange

695
04:12:18,510 --> 04:12:30,420
Red green green orange orange black. That's not correct

696
04:12:30,739 --> 04:12:41,040
Wait, then this is red green green orange orange black. There it is. I got it. I got it

697
04:12:42,040 --> 04:13:07,739
If I have to fill this whole thing, this might be game over do I have to fill this whole thing actually

698
04:13:07,739 --> 04:13:14,799
This might not be that terrible, but it might be one at a time

699
04:13:14,799 --> 04:13:25,219
Yeah, just get the edges first and I'll be good corner get corner pieces. There we go. Okay

700
04:13:25,219 --> 04:14:09,000
So there are the there's another corner down lower left Christ. I think it's top. Yeah, I think it's top, right?

701
04:14:09,040 --> 04:14:31,909
Yeah, the green green goes on top right the Olympus you can fit. Yes comfy. I feel like blue has to go up here

702
04:14:32,010 --> 04:15:20,290
Yeah, yeah, of course, of course. Damn. Oh, they don't okay. The colors don't matter. It's just what fits

703
04:15:20,370 --> 04:16:09,129
I thought I had to be separated in different colors that changes everything. Okay, can all these even make anything in here?

704
04:16:09,129 --> 04:16:12,680
They're gonna be enough. Oh

705
04:16:12,680 --> 04:16:17,420
This actually doesn't help at all

706
04:16:17,500 --> 04:16:47,180
Maybe someone's first chat message ever one message was this game fucking sucks first chat message first time out

707
04:16:49,579 --> 04:16:58,629
That's got to be a record, right? And no it does not you are wrong

708
04:16:59,250 --> 04:17:04,090
This game is actually very comfy and it's very fun and I enjoyed I've been playing it for like four hours

709
04:17:42,579 --> 04:18:37,989
I quit I'm gonna play a homerun baseball game now. It was fun. I like this a lot

710
04:18:38,030 --> 04:18:48,389
How many um, how many levels are here? What am I not even close? Oh

711
04:18:49,350 --> 04:19:18,209
I was like, I've only done 2% of the game. Oh the misery every single person is my enemy spare the sympathy

712
04:19:21,649 --> 04:19:34,780
You know how many people just like fucking click the X just like click move over here click X and

713
04:19:37,450 --> 04:19:50,290
They realized they closed all their tabs and I just fucking ruin their night only

714
04:19:50,690 --> 04:19:52,610
One two, three, four five six

715
04:19:52,610 --> 04:19:57,010
It is enough levels to probably do another hour or two, but I want to play this baseball game

716
04:19:57,049 --> 04:20:04,200
It's called I think it's called like super psycho baseball or something. It's like you have to hit a home runs and it's hard

717
04:20:04,420 --> 04:20:17,049
I'll try it. That's good. Good. Good. Good. Yes. Fuck. Yeah. Yeah. All right, let's do it

718
04:20:17,049 --> 04:20:23,040
That was a little to the left. I give that a

719
04:20:25,399 --> 04:20:33,500
Stamp that was fun recommended cozy. There's still a lot to do and I guess maybe this time

720
04:20:33,540 --> 04:21:08,180
It's timed. All right. Hold on. Did I get more than one star on any level? What? Oh, you guys can't even see

721
04:21:08,420 --> 04:21:29,700
Oops, sorry about that. The answer is no. There you go
