1
00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:37,070
What am I looking at here? I'm looking at the chat and I just see somebody's writing like pp and like pooh pooh and shit. Like what? Come on, guys. It's 2019. We're in 2019 now. Come on. We're not doing that anymore. Really? Not on my live broadcast. Not on my livestream. You know what I'm saying? You know what I'm saying? You know what I mean? All right. 2019 resolution. I'm going to stop saying at the end of every four sentences. You know what I mean?

2
00:00:37,109 --> 00:00:39,530
I'll try. Other New Year's resolution. I am not going to say we did. We did the award for it. The word that is the it is the it is the first name. Not doing it anymore. That was fun in 2018. You know what I mean? Well, hope you had a good new year. Hopefully you're rested. Hopefully you had fun. Hopefully you were responsible. We're in 2019. So this is technically the first stream in starting in 2019 because

3
00:01:24,659 --> 00:02:13,900
yeah, I streamed in 2019, but it started in 2018. Welcome to the first stream of the new year. And we're going to kick it off with a good one because this is Metal Gear rising. Revengeance. Is that a real word? How can you have vengeance be twice like a revengeance? Isn't vengeance just already something you do? So this is Metal Gear. Two vengences. Revenge vengeance. But anyways,

4
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:56,460
this is a game that's been requested a lot of times and figured because just kind of want to play something, hang out for the new year. It was either this visceral cleanup detail or back to Kenshin. We did a little poll. It was pretty close. So this did end up winning. Dermot, you need to learn to parry. You noob. Ha ha ha ha ha ha. I haven't even done anything yet. You can't make that joke until you see it happen. So what if I do really good with parries? What if I'm just

5
00:02:56,539 --> 00:03:48,139
then you're going to look real silly in like 30 or 40 minutes, aren't you? Dermot, I just got banned from RuneScape for cheating. Well, why are you cheating? Why are you cheating in RuneScape? Don't do that. Come on. I just got, but cut that out. He learned from me. When have I ever, I don't cheat in video games. When have I ever cheated, truly cheated in a game? It hasn't happened. Safe scumming is not cheating.

6
00:03:48,460 --> 00:04:27,069
Turn on the face cam or riot. My face cam is not even hooked up. It's sitting over here and not plugged in. So it's not going on. No, I'm not doing a face cam. Just pretend that that's me in like the fucking dentist suit. You know what I mean? The me with like the dentist thing on my mouth. That's me in there. I was going to say, uh, all right, starting off the new year. Great. We're going to start the story. This is like a four hour game, right? I'll blow through this and fucking free.

7
00:04:32,079 --> 00:05:08,519
So I don't just give a hundred dollars, a hundred dollars from Collie Brady, 106 hours. If you're a bad, I'll do it too. Okay. Time me a happy new year. Jerma hope 2019 is a good one for you. Love from Ireland. Jerma heart. Thank you so much. Collie Brady. Thanks for your a hundred fucking dollars. A hundred. God. I didn't really touch upon on the New Year's Eve stream because I would just had to, I had to get out of there. You know, I got to get out of here, but totally shit guys.

8
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:10,860
You guys are fucking incredible. Thank you. So let's start metal gear rising. I've got a controller plugged in. Does that mean I'm bad? New game. Normal, easy. I'm not going to play it on easy. I'm not playing this game on heart. Okay. Why would I play on heart? No, I'm not going to already ruin the stream. Normal. Hard with a face cam. I'm not going to play on heart. I don't play gay. I don't do this on heart. The developers designed an experience and here's how people design video games guys from some

9
00:05:49,740 --> 00:06:22,139
body that's in the industry. You know, I died. I've had my hand in it a few times. Normal is how all the developers, all the programmers on people like that are working on computers of the design. This is the game that they wanted you to play. They made this this way. Easy is all right. Like you, like it's, you don't have to like really worry about it. Just enjoy it and press X a bunch of times and you'll be fine. They made this for the super humans. Hard. This is the way the game,

10
00:06:22,139 --> 00:07:01,500
it's like times two speed from my understanding. When you put the game on hard, enemies are at times two speed, times two health and times two damage. I don't want to do that. Bullshit. You just suck. Hey, I beat, I beat fucking dancer. First try dark souls three. I beat flame lurker. First try. I beat Jevil. First try. So excuse me. I mean, I did, I did lose to pinwheel like 30 times, but that's because I was like fucking, I had like a headache that day. I'm doing, I already did it. It's normal. That's fine. I don't, you can call. I'm playing on normal.

11
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:14,180
Look, if it's too easy for me, I'll go back. I'll go. I'm just going to play on normal. I want to, I want to enjoy the game the way that the violent the developers begin with a quick warmup. Shall we? All right.

12
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:21,180
Is it really that much different?

13
00:07:21,180 --> 00:08:03,259
Am I a chicken? No, it's going to be fine. If it's too easy. Look, I can just go like this and turn it on. Look at, look at this options. Hard can be turned on. What? Right? Hard on. It's not that big of a deal. All right. Our right trigger is ninja run. This is kind of cool.

14
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:27,430
Swinging your blade while dashing, for example, or striking your foe. I know, I know. Everybody's already saying that that's me in the corner over there. And that's funny, but not really. That feels fluid. Is this one of those fluid games? It feels like a fluid game.

15
00:08:32,549 --> 00:08:56,990
Why would I need to parry when I can just do this? Can I play through the whole game doing this? He's already bad. I just turned on the game and I learned how to run.

16
00:09:01,539 --> 00:09:05,710
I just learned how to run. Can I have like even five seconds?

17
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:15,620
So bad. Oh my god. I'm so glad I'm not doing this on hard.

18
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:20,789
What is it? What button is it? Oh, I got hit.

19
00:09:52,899 --> 00:09:57,460
He thinks there's a block button.

20
00:09:57,460 --> 00:10:02,460
Oh, is there a dodge? See, look at this. Look.

21
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:11,460
Light attacks on your own in the same direction. Oh boy. Thanks for coming to the stream, guys.

22
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:14,460
I'll see you next time.

23
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:27,259
Push left stick in the direction of an enemy attack and press X at this perfect moment to use the HF blade to parry your foe.

24
00:10:28,259 --> 00:10:38,210
Like, they're talking about like this, right? Left stick, not trigger.

25
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:51,500
I don't walk up. Okay, I see. In the direction of an enemy attack, so it can be left, right, up, down. Hold left trigger.

26
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:29,169
How long am I supposed to do this for? I think I got him. When am I supposed to stop doing this? Does he have a health bar?

27
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:43,480
Oh, all right. He's dead. Hey, put that guy in a stew.

28
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,480
This guy's fucked.

29
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:04,480
Carefully aim your strike. Okay.

30
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:10,480
Is there a dodge roll? Is it the Raze? Game of the Year!

31
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:14,720
All right, let's parry. Yeah, I got it.

32
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:21,220
Don't do that to me. Camera? Oh, what the fuck's with the camera? I heard that was a complaint in the game.

33
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:28,490
I want his brain. I want his brain. Give me his brain.

34
00:12:31,139 --> 00:12:45,950
That's kind of insane. How am I supposed to do that? Do I get more points if I do it like 40 times?

35
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:56,570
Hey, somebody chop up that brain and put it in a stew.

36
00:12:57,570 --> 00:13:00,570
All right, I gotta calm the fuck down. It's been like 10 minutes.

37
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:05,570
I'm gonna expel all my energy in like fucking five minutes and like go to bed.

38
00:13:20,259 --> 00:13:26,460
2019 Jerma is not as good as 2018 Jerma. It's been 15 minutes.

39
00:13:38,899 --> 00:13:41,779
You changed.

40
00:13:46,899 --> 00:13:48,899
There he is.

41
00:13:52,899 --> 00:13:54,899
So, Whiz Snake.

42
00:13:56,899 --> 00:14:14,340
He's got a snake mouth. Does he open that snake mouth up and eat something?

43
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:20,340
There's gonna be a joke where he eats like a hot dog or a hamburger or something. He like unhinges his jaw and eats a big piece of food, right?

44
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:22,340
There's a joke that has to be in the game.

45
00:14:47,379 --> 00:14:49,379
This is a serious game.

46
00:14:50,379 --> 00:14:55,379
By the way, Mr. Lightning Bull is the worst name. That's like a child.

47
00:14:56,379 --> 00:15:00,809
Making up a terrible superhero name when they're playing pretend in the backyard.

48
00:15:01,809 --> 00:15:03,809
Mr. Lightning Bull!

49
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:14,159
Uh oh. Boss fight.

50
00:15:17,509 --> 00:15:22,889
It's Snake. It's Snake, isn't it?

51
00:15:23,889 --> 00:15:26,320
This takes place like 4,000 years in the future, right?

52
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:29,559
There he is.

53
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:42,230
Nah, I'm not even cool.

54
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,600
Everyone had like a face cam on when they played this game. My screen probably was like, whoa!

55
00:15:47,600 --> 00:16:06,610
I don't fucking care. You're so cool.

56
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:13,409
I can't wait to see this snake.

57
00:16:28,649 --> 00:16:29,649
Exit.

58
00:16:30,649 --> 00:16:37,559
Quiet compared to video game audio file.

59
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:40,820
Well, it's because it's a cutscene.

60
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:46,799
The cutscenes are always way louder in every video game.

61
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:52,799
They pre-render all these out and then the guy that's making the videos has the map plus 50 DB.

62
00:16:53,799 --> 00:16:55,799
And they just put them in. They don't even edit them. They don't even care.

63
00:16:56,799 --> 00:17:02,750
They rendered this in Final Cut.

64
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,750
That's like a .mp4 and they just gave it to their boss.

65
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:16,380
Here we go.

66
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:20,960
Do I weigh 400,000 pounds?

67
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:23,460
He's just naked.

68
00:17:27,059 --> 00:17:29,059
Turns out it was just a ghost. Ah, now that is what we call...

69
00:17:29,059 --> 00:17:31,059
I'm not going to say the E word.

70
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:38,140
That box only costed me one dollar.

71
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:40,140
What did I get? What did I get? What did I get?

72
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:44,380
Oh, it's common, but it's okay. Cool.

73
00:17:53,920 --> 00:18:00,339
I forget how to play.

74
00:18:01,519 --> 00:18:02,519
You jump with A, right?

75
00:18:03,519 --> 00:18:04,519
Here we go.

76
00:18:22,259 --> 00:18:24,259
What if I do blade attack on somebody, right?

77
00:18:25,259 --> 00:18:26,259
Gun?

78
00:18:30,259 --> 00:18:32,259
I got a minimap in the corner.

79
00:18:33,259 --> 00:18:35,430
Should I try to parry? Do I get points for parrying and shit?

80
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:38,430
Like, I don't understand. Do I have to parry and then...

81
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:40,430
That guy's a gun.

82
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:42,430
Should I wait?

83
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:44,609
Oops.

84
00:18:45,609 --> 00:18:47,609
Alright, that guy's a gun. I'm just trying to tell me to kill him.

85
00:18:48,609 --> 00:18:57,910
Cut him off! Cut him off!

86
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:09,700
You can do it, but why is it not coming off all of his body parts?

87
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:18,430
Got it. Parry.

88
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:29,759
It's going to be really easy to kill this guy.

89
00:19:30,759 --> 00:19:41,220
Hold on. Stay right there.

90
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:56,450
I want to parry.

91
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:02,380
Now, does it do it automatically or do I have to hold it like afterwards?

92
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:04,380
I guess not.

93
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:06,869
Perfect parry?

94
00:20:07,869 --> 00:20:09,240
Of course I did.

95
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,240
If you can't cut through the barricade, try defense, huh?

96
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,240
I don't understand how to get through this.

97
00:20:15,539 --> 00:20:16,539
You can't... shit.

98
00:20:17,539 --> 00:20:18,539
Nah, that's it. I'm out of here, guys. Thanks.

99
00:20:19,539 --> 00:20:29,299
I don't fucking know how to do this.

100
00:20:35,529 --> 00:20:36,529
What if it was just left...

101
00:20:41,349 --> 00:20:42,349
Here it comes.

102
00:20:43,349 --> 00:20:46,059
It's Mothra!

103
00:20:47,369 --> 00:20:48,369
No, that's a Metal Gear, isn't it? That's Metal Gear...

104
00:20:49,369 --> 00:20:51,369
Wait, don't tell me that's Metal Gear Rising.

105
00:20:52,369 --> 00:20:53,369
No, that's the name of this game.

106
00:20:54,369 --> 00:20:55,369
That's Metal Gear Ray.

107
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:57,799
It's Metal Gear Ray, right?

108
00:20:58,799 --> 00:20:59,799
I know these. I've played these.

109
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:11,980
This is the gear check to determine if I can play the game or not.

110
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:27,039
I don't care.

111
00:21:39,349 --> 00:21:40,349
I'll just let him go.

112
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:56,220
I thought somebody sucked him from the other side.

113
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:12,490
So you're Jack.

114
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:15,490
What do you want with the Prime Minister?

115
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:17,490
I want him dead.

116
00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:20,819
Nothing personal, of course.

117
00:22:21,819 --> 00:22:22,819
That's Winston's voice actor.

118
00:22:23,819 --> 00:22:25,819
Africa's just getting a bit too peaceful.

119
00:22:26,819 --> 00:22:27,819
What?

120
00:22:29,569 --> 00:22:31,569
Business ain't been the same since they shut down SOP.

121
00:22:32,569 --> 00:22:36,769
A clean break from the war economy.

122
00:22:37,769 --> 00:22:39,769
Some of us like that economy.

123
00:22:40,769 --> 00:22:42,769
How's an honest warmonger supposed to make a living?

124
00:22:43,769 --> 00:22:44,769
This is your answer.

125
00:22:48,769 --> 00:22:51,099
What does he say?

126
00:22:52,099 --> 00:22:53,099
Science is the most necessary emotion of all things.

127
00:22:54,099 --> 00:22:55,099
What's his dumb voice line?

128
00:22:56,099 --> 00:23:01,259
I won't. Not while he's still useful.

129
00:23:02,259 --> 00:23:04,519
So long.

130
00:23:07,819 --> 00:23:09,819
You get back here. I'm going to one, two, three, one, two, three you.

131
00:23:11,819 --> 00:23:16,240
I'm going to one, two, three, X, one, two, three, Y. Just you wait.

132
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:24,750
All right, I'm so pumped up for this.

133
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:28,720
Look at the legs.

134
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:32,720
One, two, three, one, two, three.

135
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:34,720
Got it.

136
00:23:40,569 --> 00:23:41,569
One. I didn't get it.

137
00:23:42,569 --> 00:23:43,869
I didn't get one, two, three.

138
00:23:44,869 --> 00:23:45,869
One, two, three.

139
00:23:46,869 --> 00:23:47,869
One, two, three.

140
00:23:48,869 --> 00:23:53,180
Okay, get out, get out.

141
00:24:10,619 --> 00:24:11,619
Don't do more than that.

142
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:19,170
What am I doing?

143
00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:22,170
I'm just making somebody's YouTuber logo from like 2014.

144
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:37,529
My logo.

145
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:47,940
The left leg.

146
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:51,910
Yeah, I understand everybody.

147
00:24:51,910 --> 00:24:52,910
Well, that was his left leg.

148
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:54,910
I'm talking about his left leg.

149
00:24:55,910 --> 00:24:56,910
What the hell are you doing?

150
00:25:04,339 --> 00:25:05,339
That hit me. Stupid game.

151
00:25:17,529 --> 00:25:18,529
Harry?

152
00:25:20,539 --> 00:25:23,119
Can I actually carry his legs?

153
00:25:24,119 --> 00:25:28,049
This is only for regular monsters.

154
00:25:29,049 --> 00:25:30,049
All right, I'll try.

155
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:37,779
I'll carry this leg of Ryan, okay?

156
00:25:38,779 --> 00:25:39,779
There you go.

157
00:25:56,230 --> 00:26:00,539
What a game.

158
00:26:01,539 --> 00:26:02,539
Oh, what a god of a gamer.

159
00:26:04,099 --> 00:26:05,099
Not really. I'm going to really focus on that.

160
00:26:06,099 --> 00:26:07,099
Like they do in the WWF.

161
00:26:08,099 --> 00:26:09,099
I'm going to focus on the leg that is in the brace.

162
00:26:10,099 --> 00:26:18,319
Maybe I should just get him bolted.

163
00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:21,970
Get bolted legs.

164
00:26:22,970 --> 00:26:28,430
Okay, but you keep doing that.

165
00:26:32,359 --> 00:26:33,359
Turn his other elephant foot into...

166
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:35,359
Yeah.

167
00:26:36,359 --> 00:26:37,359
Got this.

168
00:26:38,359 --> 00:26:42,859
What? Yeah, I can just carry everything?

169
00:26:43,859 --> 00:26:49,779
I'll carry.

170
00:26:50,779 --> 00:26:51,779
Okay, I'm going to carry whatever he's doing right here.

171
00:27:04,279 --> 00:27:05,279
Oh, I did get it.

172
00:27:06,279 --> 00:27:07,279
Okay, I didn't.

173
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:09,710
All right, that's good to know.

174
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:14,819
Whoa.

175
00:27:20,730 --> 00:27:21,730
I don't think I can carry that.

176
00:27:25,589 --> 00:27:27,789
YB?

177
00:27:28,789 --> 00:27:29,789
Oh, do I tap this?

178
00:27:30,789 --> 00:27:37,339
Because the rock music...

179
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:41,380
Picking him up and swinging him around.

180
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:43,380
I just so longed him.

181
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:45,380
I did the so long Bowser thing.

182
00:27:52,119 --> 00:27:53,119
I'm going to do desktop testing.

183
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:05,450
B.

184
00:28:09,009 --> 00:28:10,009
It's always a B, guys.

185
00:28:11,009 --> 00:28:12,309
Don't you understand?

186
00:28:13,309 --> 00:28:17,619
Where's my level ups?

187
00:28:18,619 --> 00:28:20,619
Any normal human B would have puked by now.

188
00:28:28,009 --> 00:28:29,009
There, get him.

189
00:28:30,009 --> 00:28:31,009
All right, it's a chase sequence.

190
00:28:36,599 --> 00:28:37,599
Use your ninja run.

191
00:28:38,599 --> 00:28:39,599
Probably, that's what I'm doing.

192
00:28:44,170 --> 00:28:45,170
Oh, I did...

193
00:28:46,170 --> 00:28:47,170
Just come on.

194
00:28:48,170 --> 00:28:49,170
That would have been awesome if I accidentally perfectly timed that.

195
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:57,940
I thought it was...

196
00:28:58,940 --> 00:28:59,940
I thought it was a climb up sequence or something.

197
00:29:03,349 --> 00:29:07,410
You can't give me shit for that.

198
00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:09,410
Actually, it would have been faster if I just walked up a part of the stairs.

199
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:15,920
Here's Ray again.

200
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:17,920
There, you cheat.

201
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:19,920
It still works.

202
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:25,220
Hurry up and kill the big monster so I can get some scales from the Monster Hunter World reference.

203
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:27,220
Do I block this?

204
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:31,769
Okay.

205
00:29:32,769 --> 00:29:33,769
I have to slide underneath it?

206
00:29:34,769 --> 00:29:35,769
Oh no, okay.

207
00:29:36,769 --> 00:29:37,769
Is this a jump rope?

208
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:55,099
Do I have to jump over that?

209
00:29:56,099 --> 00:29:57,099
I'm stuck in the ground.

210
00:29:58,099 --> 00:29:59,099
What is this?

211
00:30:00,099 --> 00:30:01,099
What the hell is this?

212
00:30:02,099 --> 00:30:03,849
What?

213
00:30:04,849 --> 00:30:05,849
What the fuck just happened?

214
00:30:10,670 --> 00:30:12,099
Get it!

215
00:30:13,099 --> 00:30:19,079
I get to see what he really looks like.

216
00:30:20,079 --> 00:30:24,970
Perfect parry.

217
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:29,190
Just call me Perfect Parry...

218
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:31,190
Paul.

219
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:33,190
I was going to say something else.

220
00:30:50,690 --> 00:30:51,690
I've got to...

221
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:56,279
Um...

222
00:30:57,279 --> 00:30:58,279
What?

223
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:00,970
Hold the right trigger.

224
00:31:01,970 --> 00:31:03,980
Am I supposed to be swinging at these?

225
00:31:05,539 --> 00:31:08,180
What am I looking at?

226
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:11,640
What am I supposed to be doing?

227
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,200
Oh, ninja run.

228
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:20,470
Okay.

229
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:35,000
Whatever.

230
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:41,740
He starts fucking crunching me and my blood and guts are everywhere.

231
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:44,740
My legs are ripped off and I'm like fucking mangled and shit.

232
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:55,299
I was trying to do a thing.

233
00:31:58,839 --> 00:31:59,839
Wait.

234
00:32:03,509 --> 00:32:05,509
Why is title so close there?

235
00:32:06,509 --> 00:32:07,509
I was just being a dickhead.

236
00:32:08,509 --> 00:32:09,509
Lost on the first level.

237
00:32:09,509 --> 00:32:10,509
I was fucking around.

238
00:32:10,509 --> 00:32:11,509
I was like jumping.

239
00:32:12,509 --> 00:32:13,509
Sorry, I've played...

240
00:32:13,509 --> 00:32:14,509
Yeah, guys, guys.

241
00:32:14,509 --> 00:32:15,509
Relax.

242
00:32:15,509 --> 00:32:18,509
I've played this game on iPad like ten times.

243
00:32:18,509 --> 00:32:21,990
This is the...

244
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:22,990
I'm sorry.

245
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:25,990
I'm playing the most downloaded free game on the App Store right now.

246
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:42,359
Oops.

247
00:32:42,359 --> 00:32:43,359
All right.

248
00:32:43,359 --> 00:32:44,599
So we're going to stay over here.

249
00:32:49,809 --> 00:32:52,059
It's the next big...

250
00:32:52,059 --> 00:32:56,240
Watch out.

251
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:04,710
It's the music.

252
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:05,710
All the way down.

253
00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:11,180
That's not good.

254
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:12,180
My god.

255
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:13,180
Sell that iPad.

256
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:18,230
He even died three times and I got a B.

257
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:27,089
He's still running away with this guy.

258
00:33:28,089 --> 00:33:32,589
B for bad.

259
00:33:33,589 --> 00:33:38,690
How about B for banned for life from the channel?

260
00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:40,309
Got him.

261
00:33:40,309 --> 00:33:41,309
He's done.

262
00:33:41,309 --> 00:34:00,829
That's what I would do with this all day.

263
00:34:00,829 --> 00:34:04,069
I would just go to a giant open field and just slide around like that.

264
00:34:05,069 --> 00:34:08,889
Until I was at the point of physical exhaustion.

265
00:34:09,889 --> 00:34:12,219
I would do it every day.

266
00:34:12,219 --> 00:34:14,219
That's what I would do for a living.

267
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:25,340
I was about to just run off the side and just...

268
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:27,340
I don't do the...

269
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:28,340
That's just 2019.

270
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:29,340
We don't make those jokes.

271
00:34:44,869 --> 00:34:47,900
What?

272
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:48,900
2v1 fight right now?

273
00:34:53,849 --> 00:34:54,849
Remember, this next boss fight is easy.

274
00:34:54,849 --> 00:34:55,849
If you don't beat it, you're bad.

275
00:34:56,849 --> 00:34:58,659
Just let me play.

276
00:34:59,659 --> 00:35:00,659
Enjoy the game.

277
00:35:01,659 --> 00:35:07,099
I was looking away for a second.

278
00:35:07,099 --> 00:35:08,099
I thought they were just...

279
00:35:08,099 --> 00:35:09,099
That's what was actually happening.

280
00:35:09,099 --> 00:35:11,099
Good things more is done for us.

281
00:35:12,099 --> 00:35:14,099
Why don't we ever hear speeches about that?

282
00:35:15,099 --> 00:35:18,099
Jobs, technology, a common purpose.

283
00:35:22,469 --> 00:35:24,469
I'm just so unenthusiastic.

284
00:35:27,469 --> 00:35:30,800
You ain't listening.

285
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:46,579
If I got in...

286
00:35:48,269 --> 00:35:50,269
All we're saying...

287
00:35:50,269 --> 00:35:52,269
Give war a chance!

288
00:35:54,269 --> 00:36:03,699
No!

289
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:14,820
That was crazy.

290
00:36:15,989 --> 00:36:26,769
Okay.

291
00:36:26,769 --> 00:36:27,769
Let's go!

292
00:36:28,769 --> 00:36:35,809
That was a powerful swing.

293
00:36:36,809 --> 00:36:40,260
Beat Sam or bad streamer.

294
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:41,260
I'm gonna try.

295
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:42,260
Just relax.

296
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:49,920
I love how it's like a game remote.

297
00:36:54,739 --> 00:36:55,739
I'm gonna wait for him to do something.

298
00:36:56,739 --> 00:37:00,030
We're both playing the same game.

299
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:01,030
He's waiting to parry me.

300
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:03,030
This is just...

301
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:04,659
Nice PvP fight.

302
00:37:04,659 --> 00:37:05,659
I'm gonna taunt.

303
00:37:06,659 --> 00:37:14,809
See?

304
00:37:14,809 --> 00:37:15,809
God damn it.

305
00:37:15,809 --> 00:37:16,809
I shouldn't have struck first.

306
00:37:18,809 --> 00:37:21,460
Let's see.

307
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:22,460
That wasn't even...

308
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:23,460
I thought it was a cut scene.

309
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:24,460
I thought it was a cut scene.

310
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,400
I gotta parry more than once.

311
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,400
Okay.

312
00:37:31,090 --> 00:37:32,090
It's like parry, parry, parry.

313
00:37:50,059 --> 00:37:52,059
I gotta parry individually.

314
00:37:53,059 --> 00:37:55,059
So it's parry, parry, parry.

315
00:37:56,059 --> 00:37:59,480
I'm gonna try to get that right.

316
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:04,480
He's about to lose to Sam.

317
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:11,920
So, okay.

318
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,099
I get it.

319
00:38:13,099 --> 00:38:15,099
We just have to actually just up the...

320
00:38:18,099 --> 00:38:19,099
Okay.

321
00:38:19,099 --> 00:38:20,099
I'm probably...

322
00:38:20,099 --> 00:38:21,099
I got...

323
00:38:21,099 --> 00:38:22,099
I'm .1% streamer.

324
00:38:23,099 --> 00:38:32,590
Hahaha.

325
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:46,980
Losing to the easiest bot...

326
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:47,980
Well, I'm learning how to parry.

327
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:02,760
I don't even need my game genie.

328
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:32,579
There's my opening.

329
00:39:32,579 --> 00:39:33,579
There's my opening.

330
00:39:33,579 --> 00:39:34,579
There's my opening.

331
00:39:34,579 --> 00:39:36,210
He's shooting.

332
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:37,210
Oh no.

333
00:39:37,210 --> 00:39:38,210
He has one of those action figure things.

334
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:39,210
Yeah, I think he's supposed to lose here.

335
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:40,210
This is a joke.

336
00:39:40,210 --> 00:39:41,210
You guys were baiting me.

337
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:50,699
He's supposed to lose here.

338
00:39:54,139 --> 00:39:55,139
Everyone's talking about how bad I am.

339
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:22,940
Bleed on him.

340
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:23,940
Hahaha.

341
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:30,940
Imagine this is just an elaborate game over screen.

342
00:40:36,809 --> 00:40:37,809
Oh, you're gonna raise the blade up too high

343
00:40:37,809 --> 00:40:38,809
and you're gonna get caught in the ceiling.

344
00:40:39,809 --> 00:40:41,820
Oh, you can't be outside

345
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:42,820
because it's right up.

346
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:43,820
Like Vampire, right?

347
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:44,820
Lucky devil.

348
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:53,900
Sit up a little too high

349
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:54,900
and get stuck in the ceiling.

350
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:55,900
He's just like...

351
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:57,900
Kept you waiting, huh?

352
00:41:00,489 --> 00:41:01,489
That snake!

353
00:41:01,489 --> 00:41:02,489
The snake's behind the wheel right there.

354
00:41:03,489 --> 00:41:04,489
What a fun cameo.

355
00:41:05,489 --> 00:41:14,659
That snake before the cigars.

356
00:41:14,659 --> 00:41:16,659
This takes place like 400 years ago, right?

357
00:41:17,659 --> 00:41:34,070
Is this a blind playthrough?

358
00:41:35,070 --> 00:41:36,760
I...

359
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,760
never played this game before.

360
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:56,889
Metal Gear Solid V is the first one, right?

361
00:41:58,889 --> 00:42:00,059
Yeah.

362
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:02,059
The story of Metal Gear Kingdom Hearts.

363
00:42:03,059 --> 00:42:07,219
They sell a product that you can download

364
00:42:07,219 --> 00:42:08,219
into your brain, though.

365
00:42:08,219 --> 00:42:10,230
I tried to...

366
00:42:10,230 --> 00:42:16,659
chat, I'm confused.

367
00:42:16,659 --> 00:42:17,659
Which one is Snake?

368
00:42:18,659 --> 00:42:19,659
Oh, well...

369
00:42:20,659 --> 00:42:22,659
I'm sure that it'll pop up eventually.

370
00:42:23,659 --> 00:42:26,940
So I got...

371
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:29,760
Chapter...

372
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,059
Difficulty Normal.

373
00:42:31,059 --> 00:42:32,059
Chapter Combat.

374
00:42:32,059 --> 00:42:33,059
BB.

375
00:42:33,059 --> 00:42:34,059
Time.

376
00:42:34,059 --> 00:42:35,059
BP.

377
00:42:36,559 --> 00:42:37,559
Rank B.

378
00:42:37,559 --> 00:42:38,559
Bonus B.

379
00:42:38,559 --> 00:42:40,929
How many Bs are on total BP?

380
00:42:41,929 --> 00:42:45,599
Alright.

381
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:51,940
A whole lot of Bs on the screen.

382
00:42:51,940 --> 00:43:01,789
This is gonna be kind of a fun game.

383
00:43:02,789 --> 00:43:05,059
Three weeks later.

384
00:43:09,559 --> 00:43:10,559
Oh, I know what this is.

385
00:43:10,559 --> 00:43:12,559
This is the lolly with it all.

386
00:43:26,789 --> 00:43:27,789
Come on.

387
00:43:27,789 --> 00:43:29,789
I make a Metal Gear reference?

388
00:43:29,789 --> 00:43:32,789
While playing Metal Gear and I get a bunch of question marks and chat?

389
00:43:33,789 --> 00:43:34,789
Huh?

390
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:53,000
Oh, nooooooooooo don't.

391
00:43:56,739 --> 00:43:57,739
Ah, okay, we're good.

392
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:04,340
So which one of these guys is the secret bad guy?

393
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:10,780
He looks like a secret bad guy.

394
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:11,780
He just does.

395
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:18,780
Yes, enemy cyborgs should provide plenty of MCFC electrolytes once you slice them open and extract their fluids.

396
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:23,780
Alright, gain like 50 pounds and then do what Dr. Eggman costed.

397
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:25,780
And their left hands, if you please.

398
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:27,780
Nobody wants the Eggman haircut.

399
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:28,780
Why? I don't get it.

400
00:44:28,780 --> 00:44:32,780
That combat data stored on holographic memory typically located in the left hand.

401
00:44:32,780 --> 00:44:33,780
You know when I get older?

402
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:35,780
Yeah, I really want like the Eggman.

403
00:44:35,780 --> 00:44:36,780
That data is very valuable.

404
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:37,780
The Dr. Robotnik.

405
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:38,780
You know what I mean?

406
00:44:38,780 --> 00:44:39,780
So this is the guy you upgraded with?

407
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:43,780
No, fuck that, man.

408
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:50,780
See, I'll fold that hair up and put a bunch of grease on it and fold it over the top of your head.

409
00:44:50,780 --> 00:44:51,780
That would look better.

410
00:44:53,780 --> 00:44:55,780
Grow that out really, really fast.

411
00:44:55,780 --> 00:44:56,780
Yeah.

412
00:44:56,780 --> 00:44:57,780
Yeah.

413
00:44:57,780 --> 00:44:58,780
Yeah.

414
00:44:58,780 --> 00:44:59,780
Yeah.

415
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:00,780
Yeah.

416
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:01,780
Yeah.

417
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:02,780
Yeah.

418
00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:03,780
Yeah.

419
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:04,780
Yeah.

420
00:45:05,780 --> 00:45:13,869
Grow that out really long and then fold the whole thing over and then style it.

421
00:45:17,869 --> 00:45:18,869
I mean, no, it wouldn't.

422
00:45:22,869 --> 00:45:26,869
Only one person has ever made that haircut look good.

423
00:45:26,869 --> 00:45:27,869
And it was Hulk Hogan.

424
00:45:29,869 --> 00:45:31,869
If you are not Hulk Hogan, don't have that haircut.

425
00:45:39,030 --> 00:45:48,030
Or Ben Franklin.

426
00:45:48,030 --> 00:45:57,030
Only two people in history have made that haircut look good.

427
00:45:57,030 --> 00:45:59,030
Hulk Hogan and Ben Franklin.

428
00:46:12,710 --> 00:46:25,579
All right, I'm ready.

429
00:46:25,579 --> 00:46:30,840
So stop the organization here.

430
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:33,840
I got upgrades from Dr. Eggman.

431
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:34,840
New suit.

432
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:36,460
New weapon.

433
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:38,460
Three weeks later.

434
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:57,019
The way we drop it.

435
00:46:57,019 --> 00:47:02,420
I was about to do the da-da-da noise, but no.

436
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:03,420
It's not anymore.

437
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:04,420
It's 2019.

438
00:47:04,420 --> 00:47:16,280
All right.

439
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:18,030
What do I get for it?

440
00:47:18,030 --> 00:47:19,030
I got an A for that one?

441
00:47:19,030 --> 00:47:20,030
Did I get S?

442
00:47:20,030 --> 00:47:29,030
Let's go in.

443
00:47:29,030 --> 00:47:31,030
Can I run up walls in this game?

444
00:47:31,030 --> 00:47:32,030
No.

445
00:47:32,030 --> 00:47:33,030
Return it.

446
00:47:33,030 --> 00:47:35,679
Cut the tree.

447
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:36,679
Cut the tree.

448
00:47:36,679 --> 00:47:37,679
Cut the tree.

449
00:47:37,679 --> 00:47:38,679
Oh my god.

450
00:47:38,679 --> 00:47:39,679
Relax.

451
00:47:39,679 --> 00:47:48,019
Cut the tree.

452
00:47:48,019 --> 00:47:50,019
Can I do it vertically?

453
00:47:50,019 --> 00:47:51,579
Okay, cool.

454
00:47:51,579 --> 00:47:54,579
I'm so glad you guys told me to cut the trees.

455
00:47:54,579 --> 00:47:57,099
Can I cut?

456
00:47:57,099 --> 00:47:58,099
Hold on a second.

457
00:47:58,099 --> 00:48:14,000
Whoa.

458
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,000
That's cool.

459
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:22,380
Combat manual.

460
00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:26,059
What is it?

461
00:48:26,059 --> 00:48:27,059
Codec.

462
00:48:27,059 --> 00:48:28,059
What?

463
00:48:28,059 --> 00:48:29,059
Back.

464
00:48:29,059 --> 00:48:30,059
Who am I calling here?

465
00:48:30,059 --> 00:48:31,059
Kevin?

466
00:48:31,059 --> 00:48:32,059
Looks like a war zone out here.

467
00:48:32,059 --> 00:48:33,059
The palace cleared out quick when Dolzayev's men showed up.

468
00:48:33,059 --> 00:48:34,059
The streets got pretty hot after that.

469
00:48:34,059 --> 00:48:35,059
Destroy cat.

470
00:48:35,059 --> 00:48:36,059
We're definitely going to see a few civilian casualties here.

471
00:48:36,059 --> 00:48:37,059
Luckily, it looks like most of them got out of the city before things got bad.

472
00:48:37,059 --> 00:48:38,059
What do you mean cut the cat?

473
00:48:38,059 --> 00:48:39,059
They basically got control of the entire town and are using the refinery as their HQ.

474
00:48:39,059 --> 00:48:40,059
And that's why we're hitting the plant.

475
00:48:40,059 --> 00:48:41,059
Keep in mind, those cyborgs are contractors.

476
00:48:41,059 --> 00:48:42,059
For most of these guys, this is just a job.

477
00:48:42,059 --> 00:48:43,059
There's a cat on the beach.

478
00:48:43,059 --> 00:48:44,059
In theory, once you eliminate their commanding officer, they should scatter pretty quickly.

479
00:48:44,059 --> 00:48:45,059
Okay.

480
00:48:45,059 --> 00:48:46,059
Good to know.

481
00:48:46,059 --> 00:49:13,329
There's a cat on the beach.

482
00:49:13,329 --> 00:49:14,329
I don't see a cat.

483
00:49:14,329 --> 00:49:19,019
Oh, I see a cat.

484
00:49:20,019 --> 00:49:25,019
So the joke here is you want me to hold L2 and cut up the cat.

485
00:49:25,019 --> 00:49:27,019
Why would I do that?

486
00:49:27,019 --> 00:49:28,840
Whoops-a-daisy.

487
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:29,840
Good thing you just dodged it.

488
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:30,840
Because I hit right stick.

489
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:31,840
Good dodge.

490
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:32,840
You deserve it.

491
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:34,840
I'm not going to cut up the cat.

492
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:36,840
Why would I do something like that?

493
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:42,429
No.

494
00:49:42,429 --> 00:49:43,429
That cat lives.

495
00:49:43,429 --> 00:49:47,230
Okay.

496
00:49:47,230 --> 00:49:48,230
All right.

497
00:49:48,230 --> 00:49:49,230
Get me away from that cat before I do it.

498
00:49:49,230 --> 00:49:54,670
I'm not cutting up the cat.

499
00:49:54,670 --> 00:49:57,190
No.

500
00:49:57,190 --> 00:49:58,190
Somebody else probably did that.

501
00:49:58,190 --> 00:50:00,190
And you want to see somebody else cut up the cat.

502
00:50:00,190 --> 00:50:01,190
But I want that cat to live.

503
00:50:01,190 --> 00:50:02,190
Because Resident Evil 4 taught me.

504
00:50:02,190 --> 00:50:03,190
Protect the animal.

505
00:50:03,190 --> 00:50:04,190
Protect the fucking animal.

506
00:50:04,190 --> 00:50:05,190
What is this?

507
00:50:05,190 --> 00:50:06,190
What the hell am I doing?

508
00:50:06,190 --> 00:50:07,190
I just ripped out a spinal cord.

509
00:50:07,190 --> 00:50:08,190
What?

510
00:50:08,190 --> 00:50:09,190
I'm sorry.

511
00:50:09,190 --> 00:50:10,190
It's a counterattack.

512
00:50:10,190 --> 00:50:14,659
All right.

513
00:50:14,659 --> 00:50:16,980
Well.

514
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:41,170
Easy as one, two, three.

515
00:50:41,170 --> 00:50:42,170
That's how you eat.

516
00:50:42,170 --> 00:50:43,170
Oh, I see.

517
00:50:43,170 --> 00:50:46,010
Okay.

518
00:50:46,010 --> 00:50:47,010
I missed.

519
00:50:47,010 --> 00:50:49,110
How do they miss you miss this?

520
00:50:49,650 --> 00:50:59,590
And your film eat with this body. I could take these guys with no eyes

521
00:51:00,750 --> 00:51:04,750
Intel wasn't exaggerating on the cyborg count now. They didn't do this, right?

522
00:51:05,389 --> 00:51:07,750
You wouldn't be able to talk like that if you had that on your jaw

523
00:51:09,150 --> 00:51:11,150
The super justice like this

524
00:51:11,750 --> 00:51:13,429
I mean, yeah

525
00:51:13,429 --> 00:51:17,230
Like a new body. It's really really easy and cyborgs are still you

526
00:51:18,110 --> 00:51:22,190
Thinking people way less risk of collateral damage than your typical UAV strike

527
00:51:22,909 --> 00:51:28,429
And don't forget the PR angle nations start playing Frankenstein with their troops and the public goes nuts

528
00:51:29,150 --> 00:51:31,550
PMC's on the other hand are off the ethical radar

529
00:51:32,750 --> 00:51:36,550
Yeah, they still don't think I'm PMC's in official death tolls

530
00:51:36,949 --> 00:51:41,610
What was the moving the cup SOP out of the picture private militaries needed a new edge on the market?

531
00:51:42,110 --> 00:51:47,780
We got in a way cyborgs are just SOP troops by another name

532
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:51,440
So she doesn't spill it predictable

533
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:55,730
But it makes you wonder here comes a classic spill of John these guys

534
00:51:57,250 --> 00:52:00,530
I'm not complaining. They're like walking vending machines

535
00:52:03,829 --> 00:52:05,829
Vending machines full of blood

536
00:52:08,070 --> 00:52:15,230
Easy there Dracula like I said, there's still people people who terrorize and take innocent lives for money

537
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:20,989
They sewed their fate when they took this job. Oh, whoa, I'm scared

538
00:52:26,739 --> 00:52:28,739
Still that from Bugleberry

539
00:52:30,659 --> 00:52:32,659
Yeah, he's still

540
00:52:33,059 --> 00:52:35,880
Jump-scare into the camera from BF Bugleberry

541
00:52:36,579 --> 00:52:38,420
You sure did

542
00:52:38,420 --> 00:52:48,780
s

543
00:52:48,780 --> 00:52:57,170
Storials now playable view of VR missions. All right head to the indicated waypoint straight up here

544
00:52:57,170 --> 00:52:59,170
Are there any secrets? They're like secret cats over here

545
00:52:59,809 --> 00:53:01,570
And it should be where?

546
00:53:01,570 --> 00:53:04,739
There's got to be random secrets in this game, right?

547
00:53:05,420 --> 00:53:15,420
Cut the billboard cut billboard cut billboard. All right, my god

548
00:53:16,340 --> 00:53:27,579
Cool, you'll need to head inland. But first make your way through this building

549
00:53:28,199 --> 00:53:34,679
Cut car cut car in half the coastline is too long and heavily gun. You must take the inland route

550
00:53:35,579 --> 00:53:39,360
Cut ground. I don't want to do that

551
00:53:39,639 --> 00:53:42,139
The whole the earth will cut in half

552
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:49,059
Right. This is Boris. Give me your status looks clear. No one in sight. Good. Let's recap the route

553
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:54,380
You will take as I said the enemy's HQ is in the refinery along the coastline

554
00:53:54,780 --> 00:53:58,860
Dolce I have has been spotted there using satellite photography also on site

555
00:53:59,340 --> 00:54:01,980
Mistral a desperado captain cut Boris

556
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:05,099
So I go through the city I cross the bridge into the old town

557
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:07,980
Then head down to the rear of the refinery keep walking

558
00:54:08,699 --> 00:54:13,739
I think I'm gonna walk and be on the phone. We'll probably have a grand reception awaiting you at the old city

559
00:54:14,300 --> 00:54:16,300
Do not let your guard down

560
00:54:18,449 --> 00:54:21,840
All right, so I gotta get up there

561
00:54:23,420 --> 00:54:30,590
Ooh chest plus one repair nano paste

562
00:54:31,710 --> 00:54:35,710
I think I didn't just sprint through wait about anything can open the boxes

563
00:54:36,989 --> 00:54:39,230
Oh shit, you can

564
00:54:42,019 --> 00:54:47,579
Everything can just be chopped up. Thank god. I have a good cpu for this

565
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:51,840
Okay, uh, so I gotta get up there

566
00:54:53,860 --> 00:54:56,019
No, wait, there's more boxes now. This is couch

567
00:54:56,980 --> 00:54:59,280
It's gotta be perfect right down the middle cut

568
00:55:00,670 --> 00:55:06,429
Fuck I didn't realize that was gonna happen. Right it if you ever get lost use augment mode to check your next objective

569
00:55:07,550 --> 00:55:11,230
So now you can fit it through wait toggle ar using augment mode

570
00:55:11,469 --> 00:55:15,230
You can see enemy positions and the direction in which you should head

571
00:55:15,789 --> 00:55:18,989
Useful for when you cannot find your objective on the soliton radar

572
00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:22,500
Hey, thanks

573
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:25,380
I probably would have been here for so long

574
00:55:25,699 --> 00:55:29,340
All right, we got another uh chest here

575
00:55:29,659 --> 00:55:31,650
What's that

576
00:55:31,650 --> 00:55:34,059
Bp

577
00:55:34,059 --> 00:55:39,260
I don't want to say but it's just so easy to say b and then p, you know what I mean from two days ago

578
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:43,980
Hostiles in the lower corridor. I see try to flank them or approach from behind

579
00:55:44,940 --> 00:55:47,179
I'm not doing it. I told you i'm leaving that in 2018

580
00:55:48,219 --> 00:55:52,369
All right, let's get over here and do like the fun move where you jump down and then splash them

581
00:55:54,610 --> 00:55:57,809
Nice

582
00:55:57,969 --> 00:55:59,570
Excellent raiden

583
00:55:59,570 --> 00:56:05,199
What's out here this time i'm gonna deflect rockets and shit

584
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:08,320
Is this stealth in this game take that main thoroughfare?

585
00:56:08,719 --> 00:56:11,599
You can use augment mode to see where the enemy is located

586
00:56:12,079 --> 00:56:16,079
Your body analyzes radar and ir data to construct your ar display

587
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:20,480
Some civilians are still in the city. That is not good

588
00:56:21,679 --> 00:56:25,760
When it flashes blue use blade mode blue blue blue black flat blade

589
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:30,210
Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah. What are you doing? This area is off limits

590
00:56:36,349 --> 00:56:38,349
That guy's crouching too much

591
00:56:48,750 --> 00:56:50,829
Oh, nice try almost got me

592
00:56:51,469 --> 00:57:02,980
Can I parry the grenade?

593
00:57:09,070 --> 00:57:11,070
All right, who's left you

594
00:57:11,150 --> 00:57:15,230
This guy's a little different

595
00:57:15,309 --> 00:57:16,510
So

596
00:57:16,510 --> 00:57:18,510
Okay. All right, whatever when they're up here

597
00:57:21,610 --> 00:57:29,840
Sands high restart. I killed a civilian. I did not I did no such thing. Oh, it's one of the goat things

598
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:41,550
Dodge roll

599
00:58:14,420 --> 00:58:16,420
That makes things a lot easier

600
00:58:27,889 --> 00:58:38,050
That guy didn't even exist like I just flipped over into me and turned into nothing

601
00:58:38,849 --> 00:58:50,940
Oh, I tried to do it

602
00:58:50,940 --> 00:58:51,900
What?

603
00:58:51,900 --> 00:58:53,019
What?

604
00:58:53,019 --> 00:58:54,380
Okay

605
00:58:54,380 --> 00:59:09,900
What do I do?

606
00:59:09,900 --> 00:59:11,900
Did I miss something? No, I got it

607
00:59:19,949 --> 00:59:24,349
Blade wait, hold on. Wait, wait when they turn blue I have to press left. Okay

608
00:59:26,739 --> 00:59:30,340
I thought you I thought what you talked about the blue up there when it was full or something

609
00:59:32,670 --> 00:59:34,670
Blade mode when the symbol appears

610
00:59:35,980 --> 00:59:40,059
change sub weapon

611
00:59:40,059 --> 00:59:42,880
recovery

612
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:43,920
main

613
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:47,389
Okay, here's grenades

614
00:59:47,389 --> 00:59:53,900
A small quantity of the substance found in cyborg and ug self-repair units that can be used to immediately restore raden's

615
00:59:54,380 --> 00:59:56,699
A life gauge. Okay, so it's heads. He's a heal

616
00:59:57,659 --> 01:00:07,570
And then this is a grenade

617
01:00:07,969 --> 01:00:09,969
the latest in fragmentary grenades

618
01:00:10,769 --> 01:00:12,289
Yeah, yeah

619
01:00:12,289 --> 01:00:15,489
Uh, I get the mouse office. I just dropped the fucking mouse hole

620
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:21,280
Uh larger and heavier than a conventional grenade requires cyborg great strength to throw it

621
01:00:21,840 --> 01:00:23,760
all right, so

622
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:25,440
Lb is

623
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:28,880
Equipped. Oh i'm holding it now. Okay, uh throw it

624
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:34,179
Where is it?

625
01:00:34,179 --> 01:00:37,139
Well a great place to give me the tutorial for that

626
01:00:50,079 --> 01:00:51,599
Okay, let's go

627
01:00:51,599 --> 01:01:01,699
Oh, that was long. That was a long animation

628
01:01:04,860 --> 01:01:06,219
Oh fuck

629
01:01:06,219 --> 01:01:11,380
Am I supposed to be fighting both these guys the same time?

630
01:01:11,940 --> 01:01:40,269
Where did this guy come from? Oh my god. I'm like getting my ass kicked here. I'm gonna like die

631
01:01:47,860 --> 01:01:52,659
All right. I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna do it. What? Why is it not doing it? Did I have not enough power?

632
01:01:53,539 --> 01:01:57,869
There's a guy behind me

633
01:01:57,869 --> 01:02:03,039
I did hold it

634
01:02:03,039 --> 01:02:05,039
Hold blade mode. That's what I was doing

635
01:02:05,679 --> 01:02:22,829
All right. Sometimes I'll do it

636
01:02:23,550 --> 01:02:25,550
Sometimes i'll press like up and x

637
01:02:26,829 --> 01:02:28,829
What the fuck is going on

638
01:02:29,570 --> 01:02:35,730
I thought it was hold it hold it when he does this he's blue. He's blue. This guy's blue right now. All right, he's blue

639
01:02:39,630 --> 01:02:41,630
I hold it when he's blue

640
01:02:41,630 --> 01:02:45,119
That what happened?

641
01:02:45,119 --> 01:02:47,119
The screen also has to be blue

642
01:02:49,380 --> 01:02:56,349
Okay

643
01:02:56,349 --> 01:02:58,269
I just uh, well

644
01:02:58,269 --> 01:03:08,059
Everybody's screaming at me

645
01:03:08,139 --> 01:03:10,139
Do the blade mode tutorial

646
01:03:11,630 --> 01:03:16,269
Well, I haven't done that yet. Is that gonna is that happen soon? They haven't like taught me this shit yet

647
01:03:16,989 --> 01:03:31,730
You shouldn't see most likely an enemy data terminal. Check it out. We may be able to salvage some intel

648
01:03:33,980 --> 01:03:35,980
Let me see

649
01:03:36,639 --> 01:03:40,420
Not wrong is it under help

650
01:03:43,260 --> 01:03:46,860
All right. Hold on a second light attack launcher during light attack strong attack

651
01:03:47,579 --> 01:03:49,579
Yeah, yeah flurry kick

652
01:03:49,739 --> 01:03:58,050
Let me just see these for a second heal the drop y slight pause then x y

653
01:04:01,059 --> 01:04:03,619
Vr missions hold on. I know I just wait wait wait wait wait wait

654
01:04:14,739 --> 01:04:16,820
Um, no, no, no, I don't want to do this yet

655
01:04:17,539 --> 01:04:21,659
Let me get to like the stopping point here. I feel like it's gonna pull me out of the whole game

656
01:04:24,699 --> 01:04:29,820
But I don't know all this stuff. You know what I mean? Like I how am I supposed to know all these things that I?

657
01:04:29,820 --> 01:04:34,780
Have not known

658
01:04:34,780 --> 01:04:37,579
Greeting you missed the terminal. Oh i'm busy looking over here

659
01:04:38,719 --> 01:04:42,159
Show yourself telling people to do the thing that I didn't learn yet

660
01:04:43,119 --> 01:05:12,699
All right, I got this in the hard way. Well, how else would you do it?

661
01:05:13,420 --> 01:05:15,420
I need to figure it out

662
01:05:15,739 --> 01:05:19,659
I can go and do that. I can do the vr thing if I really feel the need to

663
01:05:21,730 --> 01:05:27,199
And you are I am I have just the final fantasy 7 monster

664
01:05:31,980 --> 01:05:40,219
Interface prototype all autonomous ugs feature high level onboard artificial intelligence an additional prototyping to base enables

665
01:05:40,619 --> 01:05:44,300
How big does it download? I possess an intellect 20 30 gig

666
01:05:46,059 --> 01:05:47,659
You don't say

667
01:05:47,659 --> 01:05:51,179
Okay, then what's the meaning of life? Why are we here?

668
01:05:55,500 --> 01:05:58,940
Good bad time that pretty good. I am here to kill you

669
01:06:05,869 --> 01:06:08,030
oh

670
01:06:08,030 --> 01:06:10,030
My god, that hurts. That's it

671
01:06:10,590 --> 01:06:13,389
Pretty simple thinking for such a mighty intellect

672
01:06:14,929 --> 01:06:18,690
I may analyze orders, but I may not disobey them

673
01:06:19,090 --> 01:06:22,610
Should I disobey a direct order? My memory would be wiped

674
01:06:23,250 --> 01:06:27,969
I must destroy you. Is this the same actor doing the same conversation here if you can't use it

675
01:06:29,090 --> 01:06:31,090
Your taunting is pointless

676
01:06:31,550 --> 01:06:33,550
Exterminate

677
01:06:33,570 --> 01:06:37,730
See how badly I need to do the uh, vr tutorial we'll find out real quick

678
01:06:38,929 --> 01:06:52,929
Who goes first?

679
01:06:58,699 --> 01:07:04,780
Probably should have done that

680
01:07:09,809 --> 01:07:11,809
No, target him what whoa

681
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:23,329
You will die as all of these tools get up here I get up there too

682
01:07:24,530 --> 01:07:27,650
What's he doing? What's that move? He did the blink could I

683
01:07:28,989 --> 01:07:30,989
Oh, he howled in fucking ads

684
01:07:31,469 --> 01:07:39,219
Can I have a pair of the grenades?

685
01:07:39,300 --> 01:07:43,969
Get this away

686
01:07:50,659 --> 01:07:55,650
Back down here

687
01:07:55,650 --> 01:07:57,650
Exterminate your consciousness

688
01:08:00,289 --> 01:08:14,619
And ready here we go get it that didn't work that didn't work. I thought I could do something there

689
01:08:17,899 --> 01:08:31,569
I really thought that was gonna work. Do it

690
01:09:01,810 --> 01:09:06,289
Stop doing that. What the hell is going on turn that off?

691
01:09:16,050 --> 01:09:19,170
I'm trying to all right. I'm getting confused with the animations here

692
01:09:19,890 --> 01:09:21,890
Sometimes i'll do up an x

693
01:09:21,890 --> 01:09:23,890
I must have to not be moving right?

694
01:09:24,529 --> 01:09:27,789
Because sometimes i'll do it and he won't parry

695
01:09:34,430 --> 01:09:40,420
All right. I I held it. I swear to god I did I promise you

696
01:09:56,930 --> 01:10:21,569
Where is he? Where the fuck is he? Where'd he go? Did I not get it?

697
01:10:22,750 --> 01:10:24,750
Superficial damage

698
01:10:28,590 --> 01:10:40,000
I did it

699
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
Okay, we're good

700
01:10:45,579 --> 01:10:48,699
So what what was the difference between that and the last one I held it

701
01:10:51,199 --> 01:11:02,460
The next time I do that i'm gonna just hit him once in the toe region. See if I can kill people like that

702
01:11:05,899 --> 01:11:07,899
I gotta see for that one, but it's all right. Don't worry

703
01:11:10,479 --> 01:11:13,520
All right, solve the weapon tutorial is now played. All right, here we go

704
01:11:14,479 --> 01:11:17,359
Let me do let me let me just do them now

705
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:20,079
Wait, does that does that am I a checkpoint? I am right?

706
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:27,260
How does one change?

707
01:11:32,380 --> 01:11:36,060
How do you uh, oh, okay. All right. Well, I just took it apparently

708
01:11:36,859 --> 01:11:38,930
I thought I had to change it

709
01:11:38,930 --> 01:11:45,949
Apparently something over here

710
01:11:50,909 --> 01:11:53,630
Have you not played bane? I've never played bayonet. No

711
01:11:54,430 --> 01:12:02,930
Hello chip. Let's go

712
01:12:05,470 --> 01:12:07,729
play that next

713
01:12:07,729 --> 01:12:10,779
maybe

714
01:12:10,779 --> 01:12:20,640
Is there a stealth?

715
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:22,720
Perfect parry here we go one two

716
01:12:23,680 --> 01:12:25,439
Come on now

717
01:12:25,439 --> 01:12:27,619
I want a perfect parry you dude. Let's go

718
01:12:28,979 --> 01:12:32,220
Okay, i'm not even gonna perfect parry it was point just kill him

719
01:12:33,260 --> 01:12:47,729
Like I may cry isn't the new one coming out soon

720
01:12:48,529 --> 01:12:51,680
May anymore secrets

721
01:12:51,680 --> 01:12:53,180
secret

722
01:12:53,180 --> 01:13:02,819
Got it. Just run like a baby

723
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:15,819
Oh speaking of running

724
01:13:15,819 --> 01:13:19,420
That that easily he's dead. He's just gone. It's that easy

725
01:13:21,100 --> 01:13:22,779
No screams

726
01:13:22,779 --> 01:13:25,819
No big dramatic finish. No, he just fell off the bridge

727
01:13:32,210 --> 01:13:34,710
I got just I just got stuck on the environment

728
01:13:35,489 --> 01:13:37,489
I got stuck on the lip of the bridge

729
01:13:38,130 --> 01:13:43,890
How did I get stuck on that?

730
01:13:44,850 --> 01:14:04,270
Same spot do the tutorial on the bridge

731
01:14:04,989 --> 01:14:11,069
Oh my god, I guess we keep going

732
01:14:17,819 --> 01:14:19,819
Oh my god

733
01:14:22,590 --> 01:14:26,430
Oh, no, we have to do this again. Fuck. This is gonna be the hardest thing I can do in this game

734
01:14:26,829 --> 01:14:38,539
Is run the bridge

735
01:14:38,619 --> 01:14:42,380
All right. So seriously what is what is the problem here?

736
01:14:46,909 --> 01:14:48,909
Stop jumping. It makes you slow

737
01:14:49,390 --> 01:14:53,039
I didn't jump once

738
01:14:53,279 --> 01:14:57,119
Half of you guys are saying jump and the other half is saying don't jump

739
01:14:58,079 --> 01:15:13,390
Which one is it?

740
01:15:13,390 --> 01:15:15,550
See i'm gonna run that wasn't ready to run last time

741
01:15:20,140 --> 01:15:21,729
Don't lose

742
01:15:21,729 --> 01:15:25,489
Is this bridge is my dumb with bridge? Oh lord

743
01:15:26,050 --> 01:15:43,760
Come on, do it again. Maybe I have to get up closer

744
01:15:50,270 --> 01:15:52,270
Uh kind of maybe

745
01:15:52,350 --> 01:15:55,550
All right, the lock on is just fucking my brain here. Let's get up here

746
01:15:58,979 --> 01:16:00,979
Don't eat them. Don't eat them

747
01:16:05,390 --> 01:16:07,390
Uh, all right. Well that was

748
01:16:07,869 --> 01:16:09,659
Okay

749
01:16:09,659 --> 01:16:12,220
It blinked is it blinking? Is it shooting the?

750
01:16:14,930 --> 01:16:16,130
All right, what?

751
01:16:16,130 --> 01:16:26,539
Where'd he go? Okay

752
01:16:28,140 --> 01:16:30,140
Use that as that's what I was trying to do

753
01:16:30,460 --> 01:16:34,819
I'm just gonna stay down here. What's the point of going up?

754
01:16:35,220 --> 01:16:43,649
uh

755
01:16:43,649 --> 01:16:45,649
Well, there's this on the ground

756
01:16:47,819 --> 01:16:49,979
Do I have that like equipped now the sub weapon

757
01:16:54,289 --> 01:17:00,239
Okay

758
01:17:00,239 --> 01:17:10,029
Interesting

759
01:17:10,029 --> 01:17:14,189
Well, I guess that's you just have to shoot them with the I get it sounds fun fun

760
01:17:14,829 --> 01:17:19,250
I don't know. I got another one goes right somewhere

761
01:17:27,810 --> 01:17:30,210
Is there another one of those rocket launchers?

762
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:34,880
There is

763
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:43,460
I need to get hit like one more time

764
01:17:43,939 --> 01:17:57,520
In order to run up them now, you can't fly dick

765
01:18:00,850 --> 01:18:03,250
Conveniently placed rocket launchers. Yeah, apparently

766
01:18:04,909 --> 01:18:06,189
All right

767
01:18:06,189 --> 01:18:12,319
Now i'm gonna do the tutorial

768
01:18:12,319 --> 01:18:15,920
I'm at the checkpoint head to the indicated waypoint. All right, let's go be honest

769
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:31,630
All right. So this is part of the this is new

770
01:18:35,899 --> 01:18:37,659
All right

771
01:18:37,659 --> 01:18:39,819
So this is I don't know what what I just pressed

772
01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:54,720
Your body comes equipped with a technique we call blade mode. Let's begin by assuming the fighting position

773
01:18:56,319 --> 01:19:01,140
All right fighting position sure now use blade mode to strike all of the targets

774
01:19:03,180 --> 01:19:11,810
Okay

775
01:19:15,250 --> 01:19:19,779
Right

776
01:19:19,779 --> 01:19:23,779
Now remember blade mode exacts a heavy toll on your fuel cells

777
01:19:24,319 --> 01:19:30,119
Replenish your energy by attacking enemies your blade will absorb the electrolytes automatically

778
01:19:30,579 --> 01:19:33,699
Try restoring your fuel cells back to maximum now

779
01:19:34,260 --> 01:19:39,779
Standard cyborgs you can dismember immediately. No problem. Other fools will not fall so easily

780
01:19:40,260 --> 01:19:43,539
You will first need to attack and damage them to some degree

781
01:19:43,939 --> 01:19:45,939
Powerade

782
01:19:45,939 --> 01:19:48,260
So you get it I get it back by damaging people

783
01:19:49,859 --> 01:19:51,859
Makes perfect sense

784
01:19:56,340 --> 01:20:01,140
Cool after I need to get the blade

785
01:20:02,399 --> 01:20:03,439
and now

786
01:20:03,439 --> 01:20:08,000
The zandatsu technique or stab and grab as some call it

787
01:20:08,479 --> 01:20:14,159
Activate blade mode with full fuel cells and you will automatically analyze the ideal cutting position

788
01:20:14,720 --> 01:20:21,119
Executed successfully and you will seize your full self-repair unit and restore some of your quick time event

789
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:25,520
Try it for yourself. Take the enemy's repair unit before he falls

790
01:20:28,130 --> 01:20:30,500
So I did

791
01:20:33,060 --> 01:20:35,060
That's what the square is for

792
01:20:39,729 --> 01:20:43,970
Oh, okay. I I understand that I got all right. Okay. All right. All right. All right

793
01:20:44,050 --> 01:20:49,409
All right, you have to hit the square. You have to slice through the square. That's how you get that

794
01:20:51,260 --> 01:20:53,260
Next

795
01:20:53,899 --> 01:20:59,579
Approach a target from the rear or above without being noticed and you can eliminate them with a single strike

796
01:20:59,579 --> 01:21:02,060
Did you not know already? Well, we've only seen it like three times

797
01:21:04,720 --> 01:21:07,760
I've only seen that square like three times

798
01:21:08,909 --> 01:21:22,029
Come on

799
01:21:22,029 --> 01:21:28,590
About your enhanced ar enhanced ar add several layers of information to your augmented reality vision

800
01:21:29,069 --> 01:21:33,470
Use it for additional intel on your enemies you missed it new aspects of your surroundings

801
01:21:33,949 --> 01:21:38,270
Just remember enhanced ar is automatically disabled as soon as you attack

802
01:21:41,220 --> 01:21:46,529
Yeah

803
01:21:46,529 --> 01:21:52,689
Head to the waypoint you can see me through walls. All right, he's not even doing this. All I needed to know is the square thing

804
01:21:53,649 --> 01:22:01,119
Because now that makes a whole lot of sense. You have to cut it right

805
01:22:10,289 --> 01:22:12,289
He just leaves I just

806
01:22:25,310 --> 01:22:28,350
All right, this is come across several different weapons in your missions

807
01:22:28,909 --> 01:22:30,909
Best we went over their basic use

808
01:22:31,949 --> 01:22:35,710
Pick up the rocket launcher in front of you. No, I did just I did just figure this out though

809
01:22:36,750 --> 01:22:42,029
You can equip any weapons you acquire by selecting them in the sub weapon screen

810
01:22:43,250 --> 01:22:46,449
Of course sub weapons have a limited number of uses, you know

811
01:22:47,569 --> 01:22:52,449
In this tutorial it has unlimited ammunition, but do not expect this out on the field

812
01:22:53,649 --> 01:22:57,649
You will want to save them for just the right time. I suspect you can hip fire

813
01:22:57,810 --> 01:23:02,529
Try all the sub weapons you come across you find that each has its own unique properties

814
01:23:03,810 --> 01:23:06,609
Now use these weapons to reach the goal point

815
01:23:11,090 --> 01:23:13,090
Yeah, change sub weapon. There it is

816
01:23:20,880 --> 01:23:22,640
I just accidentally

817
01:23:22,640 --> 01:23:25,579
my fucking finger

818
01:23:25,659 --> 01:23:27,659
Console aim by the way

819
01:23:27,659 --> 01:23:48,939
All right. That was fun

820
01:23:48,939 --> 01:23:54,770
Do a rocket jump. You can't do rocket jumps. What are you?

821
01:23:55,489 --> 01:24:02,270
You can't do that

822
01:24:02,270 --> 01:24:04,369
Right in the head

823
01:24:04,369 --> 01:24:05,489
Oh

824
01:24:05,489 --> 01:24:16,109
Is there a way I can quick switch weapons like that or do I have to go to the menu every time?

825
01:24:21,329 --> 01:24:26,380
All right, almost done

826
01:24:26,380 --> 01:24:30,619
Just use the d-pad. I mean that's what i'm doing. I okay right on the d-pad opens this menu

827
01:24:31,420 --> 01:24:34,380
Left on the d-pad opens the menu down on the d-pad up on the d-pad

828
01:24:35,899 --> 01:24:38,060
Does that and have to menu? Okay?

829
01:24:48,659 --> 01:24:54,020
I mean, it's not it's not my fault that this guy's on like a little cube. Okay, he's on a cube

830
01:24:55,220 --> 01:25:00,369
How am I supposed to get that guy when you have a he's on a cube

831
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:20,000
Okay

832
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
I'm serious. What?

833
01:25:22,079 --> 01:25:28,079
I guarantee you didn't do that. I guarantee you did this tutorial. He did the same fucking thing. I guarantee it

834
01:25:28,399 --> 01:25:30,880
Okay, that's a 100 guaranteed

835
01:25:31,920 --> 01:25:34,399
I won a hundred percent guarantee that

836
01:25:38,699 --> 01:25:44,220
Your new enhancements are quite something if I do say so myself now I get the square thing. I'm ready to go

837
01:25:44,539 --> 01:26:00,100
Oh sub weapons suck anyways in this game. All right. Well, that's good to know jokes on you. I didn't do the tutorial

838
01:26:01,300 --> 01:26:07,680
All right, i'm ready customized

839
01:26:16,590 --> 01:26:20,750
That poor guy I that's not what I wanted that happened god damn it

840
01:26:28,750 --> 01:26:30,510
Cut it cut the thing

841
01:26:30,510 --> 01:26:31,550
Got it

842
01:26:31,550 --> 01:26:45,760
No, get it. Got it

843
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:59,579
What the fuck are you?

844
01:26:59,579 --> 01:27:01,579
oops

845
01:27:02,989 --> 01:27:04,989
Holy shit squards

846
01:27:05,069 --> 01:27:07,069
10 community subs from squards

847
01:27:08,770 --> 01:27:10,689
Holy shit. Thank you

848
01:27:10,689 --> 01:27:17,539
That's a lot

849
01:27:17,539 --> 01:27:19,300
10 community subs

850
01:27:19,300 --> 01:27:23,220
I say I get it. I get I understand it now. It takes sometimes it takes a minute to figure out what you're doing

851
01:27:26,020 --> 01:27:29,300
Like I don't have like an implant in my brain where I download a game

852
01:27:30,100 --> 01:27:32,100
And know exactly how to do everything

853
01:27:33,140 --> 01:27:36,979
It takes a tutorial. Look, it's giving me a little bit of a break

854
01:27:37,140 --> 01:27:43,390
In your left hand and a cyborg with access and uh borrow it

855
01:27:43,470 --> 01:27:47,710
Do you see any cyborgs around here doc? Why not double back check the vehicle route again?

856
01:27:48,109 --> 01:27:52,750
You know back breaking down. No, i'm fine. Who knows maybe you can hitch a ride

857
01:27:53,229 --> 01:27:58,909
Most likely platoon commanders carry correct id data for the gate use enhanced mode to figure out who to hit

858
01:27:59,550 --> 01:28:01,229
All right, we're gonna find

859
01:28:01,229 --> 01:28:03,229
We're gonna find somebody that has the data

860
01:28:04,350 --> 01:28:06,350
This guy does apparently

861
01:28:06,350 --> 01:28:12,369
Well, there's a bunch of people in there

862
01:28:14,130 --> 01:28:19,439
How do you guys not know i'm here

863
01:28:20,430 --> 01:28:23,630
No, no, no, no, no, I didn't get it. I missed it

864
01:28:24,510 --> 01:28:32,449
No, I don't have enough. Okay, whatever

865
01:28:36,510 --> 01:28:38,510
That like little chunk of his body. Fuck

01:28:39,470 --> 01:28:58,880
Wait, somebody has the dna. Okay, I cut all around it. All right. Where are you?

01:29:06,369 --> 01:29:12,380
Hold on. Wait, wait what you what do you mean? I missed them all

869
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:18,720

870
01:29:19,279 --> 01:29:22,479
Oh their hands. Oh, I needed to bring their hand back

871
01:29:24,989 --> 01:29:26,989
I was supposed to cut that guy's arm off

872
01:29:27,390 --> 01:29:29,390
And bring it back here

873
01:29:30,029 --> 01:29:32,350
Wow, man, you missed them all holy shit

874
01:29:33,710 --> 01:29:36,909
Really am I not close enough?

875
01:29:39,729 --> 01:29:43,010
Really you missed them all that's never happened before

876
01:29:43,970 --> 01:29:46,590
I'm actually pretty surprised. That's even possible

877
01:29:47,470 --> 01:30:14,859
This early in the game

878
01:30:22,720 --> 01:30:42,270
I'm just gonna have to shoot you with the rocket launcher. I guess wait what? Oh, okay. I just I just cut that

879
01:30:44,590 --> 01:30:58,100
I gotta be quick with that

880
01:30:58,659 --> 01:31:14,960
You're dead good. I need to get a left arm

881
01:31:24,300 --> 01:31:27,739
If you cut all of someone's limbs off, they still try to come after you really

882
01:31:28,699 --> 01:31:34,060
That's kind of crazy

883
01:31:34,619 --> 01:31:39,229
All right, I got the heels

884
01:31:39,310 --> 01:32:01,359
What else we got 3d photo frame, how does that do come on get up there lore. Ooh

885
01:32:02,750 --> 01:32:04,750
Lore everybody loves lore. Don't they?

886
01:32:45,539 --> 01:32:49,460
Snipe him snipe him take the shot take the shot you have it right there snipe him

887
01:32:51,880 --> 01:33:03,579
Unbelievable. I'm a proponent of a few just don't even wear the jacket

888
01:33:04,479 --> 01:33:06,640
You know, why do you have just on your back like that?

889
01:33:17,010 --> 01:33:19,439
What's happening?

890
01:33:20,079 --> 01:33:26,579
Uh text from text from dad I just dodged a new voicemail from dad

891
01:33:27,619 --> 01:33:45,710
All right. I'm heading for the refinery. Good job parrying those cooties

892
01:33:48,189 --> 01:33:50,189
All right, hold on got the fact

893
01:33:50,670 --> 01:33:57,600

894
01:34:03,039 --> 01:34:12,350

Unpurchased all right. I have 35 000 bp

897
01:34:20,479 --> 01:34:23,920
So why would I buy one of these skins that I do anything?

898
01:34:27,710 --> 01:34:29,710
gray fox gray fox gray fox

899
01:34:30,779 --> 01:34:37,260
Functionally equivalent to recent side though. It was terminated as an exoskeleton in these days where they happen in modern cybernetic technology

900
01:34:37,340 --> 01:34:39,659
It could have been taken. So why would I do this? It's just cosmetic

901
01:34:41,260 --> 01:34:43,979
Don't I want to make sure I save my money to buy like new weapons?

902
01:34:46,300 --> 01:34:49,340

life

905
01:35:00,270 --> 01:35:08,460
Uh, I got an enhancement here enhance upgrade an updated version of raiden's cyborg body firmware that immediately reshapes his artificial muscular

906
01:35:08,859 --> 01:35:11,260
Whenever he's hit reducing the amount of damage taken

907
01:35:12,289 --> 01:35:14,130
Wow, I mean I want that

908
01:35:14,130 --> 01:35:19,119
Yeah, like endurance plus one

909
01:35:19,840 --> 01:35:25,579
This is 8 000 fuel cell an updated version of raiden's cyborg body firmware

910
01:35:26,140 --> 01:35:30,619
Optimizes power usage represented in the air display as an extended field cell. Uh, yeah

911
01:35:33,119 --> 01:35:35,569

aerial parry

913
01:35:38,720 --> 01:35:43,840
That improves balance when airborne enabling to parry enemy attacks in midair. Uh, okay. Thank you

914
01:35:46,460 --> 01:35:54,380
Faster more detailed feedback to be delivered to his brain synapses this detailed neural feedback allows raiden to freely sidestep enemy attacks in any direction

915
01:35:55,020 --> 01:35:57,020
and counter their aggression

916
01:35:57,340 --> 01:35:58,460
Yeah

917
01:35:58,460 --> 01:36:01,699
Sounds great

918
01:36:01,699 --> 01:36:07,060
Improves reaction speed in his quadriceps enabling a special upward thrust with his weapon held in his foot

919
01:36:08,319 --> 01:36:09,840
That's a dodge roll

920
01:36:09,840 --> 01:36:13,260

Strength plus one of I mean I can still I can afford it

933
01:36:59,729 --> 01:37:02,289
Moves become enabling to deal greater damage to enemies

934
01:37:03,760 --> 01:37:06,399
Absorbs more electrolytes from it makes the fuel

935
01:37:07,600 --> 01:37:09,600
Bar go up higher

936
01:37:10,699 --> 01:37:12,699

Funny story here. I accidentally purchased a shit ton of bits

01:37:44,960 --> 01:37:49,680
Completely by accident. You're my favorite human being. So here you go. Not much. What do you mean? Not much

944
01:37:52,479 --> 01:37:56,029

946
01:37:58,829 --> 01:38:04,270
All right, so that's the dodge. It's a and x at the same time in a direction

947
01:38:04,270 --> 01:38:08,590
Can I do it backwards? I can't can I do it forwards? No, so you can do side to side

948
01:38:13,279 --> 01:38:16,029
All right, cool

949
01:38:16,029 --> 01:38:18,029

Thanks for the bits, yeah, thank you

955
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,000
Greedy streamer demands more what

956
01:39:01,149 --> 01:39:04,590
I said don't say the 30 dollars is not much because it's a lot

957
01:39:05,149 --> 01:39:14,050
Fuck oh, I forgot someone's gonna unsub if I didn't cut somebody's hand off. Okay, i'll get it

958
01:39:15,649 --> 01:39:26,430

01:40:18,939 --> 01:40:22,619
What? Okay. Well, I don't know why that keeps happening. I swear to god i'm pressing it

964
01:40:22,699 --> 01:40:30,479
I'm pressing the button with right like I don't know what's going on here. Am I doing it too late or something?

965
01:40:30,479 --> 01:40:37,789
I don't get it because every time I press it it seems to not work. It just takes it off

966
01:40:39,470 --> 01:40:42,609
Pressing too early, I guess so

967
01:41:02,180 --> 01:41:04,270
Shit come here

968
01:41:04,270 --> 01:41:08,899
No

969
01:41:08,899 --> 01:41:10,739
Where is it? It's up there

970
01:41:10,739 --> 01:41:20,380
There we go. I'm gonna try it again

01:41:20,380 --> 01:41:43,039
I'm just trying to go that way. You wouldn't let me go

972
01:41:45,439 --> 01:41:53,569
Wait, no, I didn't get the hand. Oops

973
01:41:54,720 --> 01:42:00,319
We're right for backup during your last fight. The caller's position is on your soliton radar

974
01:42:00,800 --> 01:42:03,359
You can engage if you wish it is your choice

975
01:42:04,989 --> 01:42:07,069
Minus one self i'll get a hand don't worry

976
01:42:08,029 --> 01:42:12,029
Well now that what's this like optional thing it wants me to do. Let me just see. Let me i'll do it. Why not?

977
01:42:14,659 --> 01:42:17,140
I'm assuming this is like side mission content side stuff

978
01:42:20,420 --> 01:42:21,859
Oh great

979
01:42:21,859 --> 01:42:24,619
Oh, this is fantastic

980
01:42:24,619 --> 01:42:42,270
Now I wish I didn't do this

981
01:42:42,270 --> 01:42:44,270
Take it off. Take it down

982
01:42:44,590 --> 01:43:01,409
Shoot it. I can't run up those. Can I can I jump on those?

983
01:43:02,210 --> 01:43:13,840
Ah, no

984
01:43:16,109 --> 01:43:18,109
Take it off. No, you know what I was trying to say

985
01:43:32,369 --> 01:43:34,369
At least they're low enough where I don't have to shoot them with rockets

986
01:43:44,829 --> 01:43:47,310
Why are they flying so low? Yeah, they could be so much higher up

987
01:43:48,029 --> 01:43:56,979
All right, you're out

988
01:43:56,979 --> 01:43:59,810
What'd I get?

989
01:43:59,810 --> 01:44:06,779
I got a uh, uh, is it a bed? I got a bed

990
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:10,369
Okay

991
01:44:10,369 --> 01:44:19,229
What's a bed mean?

992
01:44:19,229 --> 01:44:21,229
b e d bed

993
01:44:23,859 --> 01:44:29,539
Hello, the cliff is just ahead at the end of the old city beyond that in the refinery's backyard

994
01:44:30,100 --> 01:44:34,500
So what it's a kind of currency thing the refinery is not connected to the city at all

995
01:44:35,140 --> 01:44:37,220
No, it was only built two years ago

996
01:44:37,699 --> 01:44:40,420
There should be a narrow path around there that leads to the plant

997
01:44:40,979 --> 01:44:44,579
It is protected by a fence, but probably you can cut your way through

998
01:44:45,140 --> 01:44:46,579
probably

999
01:44:46,579 --> 01:44:48,979
Don't get cocky most likely it is

1000
01:44:49,380 --> 01:44:51,539
I don't know why I was about to just scream

1001
01:44:52,340 --> 01:44:57,060
Shut up Boris as loud as I could and that would have been really bad. I'm so glad I just like suppressed

1002
01:44:57,460 --> 01:44:59,779
The the i'm glad I didn't do that

1003
01:45:00,819 --> 01:45:03,630
I was going to scream it

1004
01:45:04,210 --> 01:45:07,970
Like i'm 33. I can't you know, I don't you don't do that anymore. You know what I mean?

1005
01:45:12,210 --> 01:45:14,210
Can I get in here? What the fuck?

1006
01:45:14,609 --> 01:45:18,770
I'm like a six billion dollar ninja and I can't go through a chain link fence. Come on

1007
01:45:23,859 --> 01:45:25,060
Uh-oh

1008
01:45:25,060 --> 01:45:35,680
Got it. No, I didn't

1009
01:45:40,510 --> 01:45:56,819
Shit who's next?

1010
01:45:57,140 --> 01:46:05,010
Shit, they're like grabbing my head

1011
01:46:20,899 --> 01:46:25,699
Don't think uh the dodge roll. I'm actually I don't like doing it. I don't like how I press x and a at the same time

1012
01:46:25,699 --> 01:46:27,060
It's a little odd

1013
01:46:27,060 --> 01:46:35,949
Let me make sure I don't miss any secrets

1014
01:46:36,350 --> 01:46:38,380
secret up there

1015
01:46:38,380 --> 01:46:42,539
Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, you're gonna miss the secret. Jerma

1016
01:46:43,500 --> 01:46:46,260
I got it. I got it calm down

1017
01:46:46,340 --> 01:47:00,380
Maybe I missed it 2.1 million

1018
01:47:02,289 --> 01:47:10,909
I'm just making shrapnel. That's not good. Don't say it but his team must be in here

1019

02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:51,960
right now better now it's not me making a joke need you to infiltrate

1175
02:14:51,960 --> 02:14:56,680
the last difference everything you mean joke reference and prediction first we

1176
02:14:56,680 --> 02:15:00,520
still don't know the exact location so I'm looking for anywhere the lab

1177
02:15:00,520 --> 02:15:04,479
might hook up with the sewers yep if they're actually dumping waste

1178
02:15:04,479 --> 02:15:09,399
they've got a link up somehow find that connection sneak into the lab and see if

1179
02:15:09,399 --> 02:15:13,000
you can find evidence implicating them on anything no problem

1180
02:15:13,000 --> 02:15:19,640
stealths my specialty reference equals joke well how do we have any idea

1181
02:15:19,640 --> 02:15:24,119
what kind of research they're doing there not really that's not true

1182
02:15:24,119 --> 02:15:27,720
maybe something related to all the people they're trafficking like

1183
02:15:27,720 --> 02:15:33,359
experimentation it's possible first things first though find a way into

1184
02:15:33,359 --> 02:15:43,439
that lab all right it's all be TV black crocodile so you know watch out black

1185
02:15:43,439 --> 02:15:49,760
crocodiles could they be talking about you geez maybe just an urban legend but

1186
02:15:49,760 --> 02:15:54,079
still be careful you said it was your New Year's resolution you now

1187
02:15:54,079 --> 02:16:00,239
provide that that was the joke there's the joke sir commence operation you

1188
02:16:00,279 --> 02:16:20,140
know whoa that's just kind of what we just that was too fast what okay that

1189
02:16:20,140 --> 02:16:24,439
was joke is the you know you know New Year's resolution and it's always you

1190
02:16:24,439 --> 02:16:27,960
never do it you say you're gonna do it you don't so I'm not gonna do it

1191
02:16:27,960 --> 02:16:34,010
that would get on daytime TV if it's like twitch was on daytime TV that

1192
02:16:34,010 --> 02:16:38,129
would be daytime TV twitch.TV NBC joke

1193
02:16:43,010 --> 02:17:00,110
well wait for a parry moment right there I'm gonna get some perfect parry

1194
02:17:00,110 --> 02:17:16,590
ah fuck can you not parry those you just dodge I guess it's the dog

1195
02:17:16,590 --> 02:17:28,649
whoa I thought he was dead apparently not no what's that what is that he's

1196
02:17:28,649 --> 02:17:45,930
just like shit on an ice cube I don't oh no no wait that's an item

1197
02:17:45,930 --> 02:17:51,409
use it to conceal yourself if necessary

1198
02:17:52,610 --> 02:17:58,840
nobody knows the lyrics to those everyone only knows that one part all

1199
02:17:58,840 --> 02:18:08,329
right so I need everything but the place I need everything but the

1200
02:18:08,329 --> 02:18:11,610
place everywhere but the one spot I needed to do that I don't know how I

1201
02:18:11,610 --> 02:18:22,629
didn't relax in fact I'm gonna get back up top easy here come on you

1202
02:18:22,629 --> 02:18:30,469
can't get up there all right what and why I don't I don't explain like I'm

1203
02:18:30,469 --> 02:18:42,780
getting the glitched into the boxes just get up there that was so much

1204
02:18:42,780 --> 02:19:14,100
more difficult than it and he's gone whatever what is he gonna do it didn't

1205
02:19:14,100 --> 02:19:28,590
get the arm he does double thump

1206

1208
02:20:13,799 --> 02:20:22,719
sewers recoveries down right don't you feel automatically um I don't do

1209
02:20:22,719 --> 02:20:41,000

1211
02:21:05,540 --> 02:21:11,959
me to determine I think I need secondary items to win a guy with no arms just

1212
02:21:11,959 --> 02:21:30,299
almost killed me I actually need items for this game wait nice

1213
02:21:30,299 --> 02:21:33,500
yeah and I got replaced and plus somebody told me that the items don't

1214
02:21:33,500 --> 02:21:40,610
matter in this game guys somebody said secondary items bad also this is

1215
02:21:40,610 --> 02:21:52,440
the new weapon right one guy said that and they might be right you guys

1216
02:21:52,440 --> 02:21:57,200
seriously need to relax don't do it when you come and go to it

02:25:58,350 --> 02:26:06,809
about it you know me now go back hey you're not one of them Scott now no I

1228

02:27:00,469 --> 02:27:04,469
strongest cyborg ever warlock all them phantoms in black clothes that I

1237
02:27:04,469 --> 02:27:09,709

1242
02:27:31,739 --> 02:27:38,399
and and I know the rest George I need every detail about how you

1243
02:27:38,440 --> 02:27:47,840
escaped George please tell me so the kid got into the sewers through a

1244
02:27:47,840 --> 02:27:52,399
drainage channel yeah he says the channel is super tight but there's some

1245
02:27:52,399 --> 02:27:56,440
kind of shutter next to it yeah George that must be where they dumped the

1246
02:27:56,440 --> 02:28:02,319
waste George it sounds like a desperado exec was on site yesterday if a

1247
02:28:02,319 --> 02:28:06,000
sentry cyborg was on hand for the meeting you should be able to review

1248
02:28:06,000 --> 02:28:09,659
their video log provided you can find the server access looks like he

1249
02:28:09,659 --> 02:28:14,000
actually belongs in a different game as well as a little peek at the level of

1250
02:28:14,000 --> 02:28:18,159
that technology that's a resident evil sign so what about the kid I made sure

1251
02:28:18,159 --> 02:28:22,319
the area was secure and told him to sit tight can you pick him up sure

1252
02:28:22,319 --> 02:28:26,040
I'll send a couple agents for it you just focus on getting into that

1253
02:28:26,040 --> 02:28:31,399
land if what he said is true about the organs we need to hurry agreed

1254
02:28:31,399 --> 02:28:36,399
right now this is the right door

1255
02:28:39,399 --> 02:28:43,479
it is possible they are conducting test operations while the lab is closed

1256
02:28:43,479 --> 02:28:47,360
they're not gonna make it easy to get into that land there's some way you

1257
02:28:47,360 --> 02:28:53,239
could sneak past what's that the first time I've touched one of these

1258
02:28:53,239 --> 02:29:05,959
computer data devices all right I got it oh man oh man oh man yeah yes

1259
02:29:05,959 --> 02:29:10,549
it's gonna be so fun how's that gonna help I can't wait

1260
02:29:10,549 --> 02:29:26,680
medical supplies where is it that could work actually yeah well you knew it was

1261
02:29:26,680 --> 02:29:32,389
coming it's up no okay I thought I just get lost I have to see this is

1262
02:29:32,389 --> 02:30:15,829

1273
02:33:47,100 --> 02:33:58,610

1281
02:36:20,420 --> 02:36:39,870
done for that plus thousand full find a way into the research facility I will

1282
02:36:39,870 --> 02:36:44,979
I already cleared the whole fucking area wait I'm going the wrong way aren't I

1283
02:36:44,979 --> 02:36:58,659
am I going the wrong way right now lost for health packs equals a well when

1284
02:36:58,659 --> 02:37:03,459
they give me two of those guys the fire everywhere there's a box I could open

1285
02:37:03,459 --> 02:37:14,770
down here where is it did I already get it another something else maybe I'm

1286
02:37:14,770 --> 02:37:27,469
maybe I'm just there we go it's up there there to get it I didn't get it

1287
02:37:27,469 --> 02:38:07,879
okay really why can I not open this okay data storage I got it you got to

1288
02:38:07,879 --> 02:38:32,280
use seco mode another box that he's finite this is one out of five who

1289
02:38:32,280 --> 02:38:41,719
knows right I have determined the approximate location of the lab based

1290
02:38:41,719 --> 02:38:48,719
on your soliton radar that's a good that's a good point that's good but

1291
02:38:48,719 --> 02:39:04,649
mod that guy I'm just kidding all right so combo lists it's like a pole

1292
02:39:04,649 --> 02:39:10,709
arm okay he's in there so let's see there's just why why why why why why

1293
02:39:10,709 --> 02:39:20,200
why why why why why X why X why why X a lot of why starts yeah most of them are

1294
02:39:20,200 --> 02:39:28,319
why starts why why X why oh my lord okay why why why X why let's test

1295
02:39:28,319 --> 02:39:47,059
that out why why why okay let's test it on this guy that was like three

1296
02:39:47,059 --> 02:40:12,520
perfect areas again I thought was lined up correctly it was we got any

1297
02:40:12,520 --> 02:40:18,079
treasures not that I can confirm but hold on a minute

1298
02:40:18,079 --> 02:40:45,420
back I can't fit in here perfect shit I thought it was me I'm always afraid

1299
02:40:45,420 --> 02:41:02,829
to do a full like every dude one or two swings even up what else is in

1300
02:41:02,870 --> 02:41:13,139
here what do you want for me there's another guy in here hold on let me

1301
02:41:13,139 --> 02:41:15,659
sneak attack this guy I can stealth backstab kill this guy in one hit right

1302
02:41:15,659 --> 02:41:35,270
what's this right oh I could have done it something I actually could have done

1303
02:41:35,270 --> 02:41:39,250
that damn I really didn't think you could actually do something like that

1304
02:41:39,250 --> 02:41:54,399
I was just making a joke but you can't you actually can do that you're

1305
02:41:54,399 --> 02:42:08,809
gonna breathe fire too this is a smooth experience what's this game have

1306
02:42:08,809 --> 02:42:34,969
on medic product 61 that's unfair camera yeah the enemies are spawning

1307
02:42:35,290 --> 02:42:48,209
this farming experience point so where am I supposed to go I need to find a

1308
02:42:48,209 --> 02:42:59,459
way to get out of here and is this way can I go over I mean this is gonna

1309
02:42:59,459 --> 02:43:09,309
take me back around isn't it I was already in here right I have

1310
02:43:09,309 --> 02:43:12,709
discovered the entrance to the lab so you know coordinates to your

1311
02:43:12,709 --> 02:43:15,629
soliton radar took you long enough thanks a lot

1312
02:43:15,629 --> 02:43:28,469
playing Metal Gear Survive oh no I don't think so I don't think so

1313
02:43:31,510 --> 02:43:57,159
I took too long don't give me that it was scripted one two my forklift people

1314
02:43:57,159 --> 02:44:00,840
is there like a forklift item that you can I don't know what the fuck I'm

1315
02:44:00,840 --> 02:44:21,600
talking about so let's just play is this some kind of forklift thing when

1316
02:44:21,600 --> 02:44:29,209
am I gonna play metal gear rising probably next week this would appear to

1317
02:44:29,209 --> 02:44:32,969
be the huge in maintenance area you should find a terminal there

1318
02:44:32,969 --> 02:44:36,690
something they used to upload mission parameters to say you cheese and

1319
02:44:36,690 --> 02:44:42,209
something I can use to access the labs main server perhaps but first you need

1320
02:44:42,209 --> 02:44:46,290
no I thought there were two games that were in this series I thought it was

1321
02:44:46,290 --> 02:44:50,290
metal gear rising and then I thought there was metal gear rising revenge

1322
02:44:50,290 --> 02:44:53,770
you'll need one to interface with the terminal most any you G should

1323
02:44:53,770 --> 02:44:59,409
suffice tripod or the like I'll see what I can come up with how do I use

1324
02:44:59,409 --> 02:45:04,170
it simply connect to it you should be able to use your communications outlet

1325

window

1328
02:45:31,870 --> 02:45:35,250
well that's the only chance that I have to be able to speak because my

1329
02:45:35,250 --> 02:46:00,180
brain has to turn off when I fight enemies short attention span well nobody

1330
02:46:00,180 --> 02:46:20,450

1336
02:47:45,100 --> 02:48:12,639
or something do I just have to run away still too far away really how is

1337
02:48:12,639 --> 02:48:28,950
that even possible again I don't know how it's possible for me to miss

1338
02:48:28,950 --> 02:48:34,110
that there's only one sliver that's even possible to hit there use the

1339
02:48:34,110 --> 02:48:40,670
other stick to aim better right stick or something like a just manually do it

1340
02:48:40,670 --> 02:48:47,600
you have plenty of time and maybe that's not just freaking out I think I

1341
02:48:47,600 --> 02:49:08,440
have like a fire extinguisher all right I did it that filled up the

1342
02:49:08,440 --> 02:49:27,469
whole room can I not open this door this looks like a door I can slash

1343
02:49:27,469 --> 02:49:44,840
through apparently go down here do I eat on a day that I stream like an hour

1344
02:49:44,840 --> 02:50:22,030
before and then that's it all right well we're starting here I want to

1345
02:50:22,030 --> 02:50:28,629
try to get a bowl I did panic there for a second

1346
02:50:33,389 --> 02:50:42,569
I do have lots of time really need stuff

1347
02:50:42,569 --> 02:50:57,620
okay solid metal gears rises one of them is a sword game and the other one

1348
02:50:57,620 --> 02:51:08,469
is a when you for now stealth stealth there it is but that room those were

1349
02:51:08,469 --> 02:51:13,670
cyborg brain casings duh we saw George said they were harvesting

1350
02:51:13,670 --> 02:51:17,469
organs from kids yes this must be why they are trafficking

1351
02:51:17,469 --> 02:51:21,510
children perhaps other organs are being sold elsewhere but they are definitely

1352
02:51:21,510 --> 02:51:27,709
taking their brains Jesus are they making these kids into cyborgs wait the

1353
02:51:27,709 --> 02:51:32,190
cyborgs you've been fighting did they seem like they might be kids you said

1354
02:51:32,190 --> 02:51:35,510
earlier the child soldiers have a telltale approach to combat I just want

1355
02:51:35,510 --> 02:51:39,750
to open this up but I didn't see it here those weren't kids bad time so

1356
02:51:39,750 --> 02:51:44,069
what desperado is just doing the surgeries there we've got to do

1357
02:51:44,069 --> 02:51:47,790
something about all those brains and the other kids George was talking about

1358
02:51:47,790 --> 02:51:52,430
he changes his voice a few hours ago he does the Christian Bale Batman

1359
02:51:52,430 --> 02:51:56,750
thing true there could still be a bunch of kids they haven't touched yet

1360
02:51:56,750 --> 02:52:17,270
I better move sometimes he just goes like this sometimes okay all right I

1361
02:52:17,270 --> 02:52:18,969

pretzel you found on the ground you don't just put that into your

1363

damn it any funny business and they might just open fine try latching onto

1364
02:52:43,590 --> 02:52:47,389
cyborgs heads from behind then an electric shock should lock them

1365

an arm or brain anybody part for several hours so what are they

1438
03:07:42,319 --> 03:07:46,879

1478
03:16:13,979 --> 03:16:18,700
highway and just see this guy yeah just remember that I guess would that be

1479
03:16:18,700 --> 03:16:21,540
really bad out of the ordinary

1480
03:16:44,100 --> 03:16:48,379

corporate rating now can we you could at least come talk to me no it was

1482
03:16:54,370 --> 03:16:58,530

1483
03:16:58,530 --> 03:17:02,969
Marshall all by yourself I won't sit by while they put your little kids and

1484
03:17:02,969 --> 03:17:08,610

1485
03:17:08,610 --> 03:17:13,049
things legally for medical purposes it's all being legal doesn't make it

1486
03:17:13,049 --> 03:17:34,250

if that happened you would throw up I can't just have that if your car flips

1491
03:18:35,379 --> 03:18:47,379
upside down going like a hundred miles per hour you're going to puke 18 3 1 0

1492

4.7 threatening a peace officer deadly forces authorized not me it's striker

1493

steal their spine the road is blocked by barricades we will proceed through

1500
03:21:27,629 --> 03:21:32,389
the buildings you will follow me if you prefer if you prefer enough times

1501
03:21:32,389 --> 03:21:38,739
you will insta-kill remember I told you I didn't want to fight now I got

1502
03:21:38,739 --> 03:21:40,500
to fight to all right I got to put my

1503
03:21:40,500 --> 03:22:34,709
ears up easier dodge good dodge ah god damn it you have to let go

1504
03:22:34,709 --> 03:22:50,729
when I jump up I have to let go I really am playing this like Dark Souls and I

1505
03:22:50,729 --> 03:22:53,850
can't help it I'm trying to like I'm trying to

1506
03:22:53,850 --> 03:23:56,780
invincibility frames try this again got it play Jebel may cry people are

1507
03:23:56,780 --> 03:24:06,350
dropping behind me all right sneak up behind him and press B oh okay you

1508
03:24:06,350 --> 03:24:11,430
have to be all right well I missed it I get I did that's the first time I've

1509
03:24:11,430 --> 03:24:15,909
ever done that I see you sneak up behind them and then press B and then

1510
03:24:15,909 --> 03:24:39,760
left trigger easy enough okay it's be right up their ass I got it the

1511
03:24:39,760 --> 03:25:02,159
indicator moves it's difficult I mean let's be honest here what was the

1512
03:25:02,159 --> 03:25:06,719
actual how does I get that I don't I mean was I gonna really wait

1513
03:25:06,719 --> 03:25:10,739
there for like 30 seconds while the guy walked all the way across no I want

1514
03:25:10,739 --> 03:25:24,299
to play use the right stick to aim your cut doesn't right stick swing

1515
03:25:24,299 --> 03:25:37,709
though doesn't right stick just swing okay all right I thought right stick

1516
03:25:37,709 --> 03:26:11,899
just swung in the direction you have to hold it somehow that's harder

1517
03:26:12,459 --> 03:26:36,899
thought you're gonna swing well okay getting used to I should probably learn

1518
03:26:36,899 --> 03:26:47,069
how to do it though another wave is that that's it only three people what's

1519
03:26:47,069 --> 03:26:54,819
up with them I'm gonna need to do that for later well I'm gonna just try to

1520
03:26:54,819 --> 03:27:05,659
get used to it little boxes what is this that was not worth going all the

1521
03:27:05,659 --> 03:27:22,319
way down there I'm ignoring the posters posters don't look at the poster at the

1522
03:27:22,319 --> 03:27:34,909
beginning of the whole I gotta go back to the beginning of the whole level is a

1523
03:27:34,909 --> 03:27:49,690

1529
03:28:16,090 --> 03:28:22,139
atrocity after another hmm like what you went through we can't have any more

enemies in these little rooms no dodge damn it cut the one part of his

1547
03:31:30,950 --> 03:31:52,530
body off that it needed to cut somehow through all that odd just move

1548
03:31:52,530 --> 03:32:05,659
back at them that's not a block how was that a how is that why does it do

1549
03:32:05,659 --> 03:32:31,170
that sometimes and just use the d-pad right all right well that's a seed

1550
03:32:31,170 --> 03:32:37,340
because they're fighting two huge enemies in a little room get this

1551
03:32:37,340 --> 03:32:58,190
stupid thing off how do I know I don't know the lock on because when I

1552
03:32:58,750 --> 03:33:15,780
small room like that the camera just rips around like crazy I don't know if we're gonna be able to use that

1553
03:33:15,780 --> 03:33:54,360
okay get this off all right finally we're good told you the polar I'm

1554
03:33:54,360 --> 03:33:59,000
sucked I don't know about that it's just it's kind of slow doc what's your

1555
03:33:59,000 --> 03:34:03,319
status I am reviewing the pre-flight checklist now I have got a huge

1556
03:34:03,319 --> 03:34:07,239
radius to handle shipping the brain units we should be airborne in just a

1557
03:34:07,239 --> 03:34:10,559
few minutes you sure you can pilot that chopper by yourself

1558
03:34:10,559 --> 03:34:12,559
pull on something in every game

1559
03:34:12,559 --> 03:34:17,639
need I remind you that we live in the golden age of unmanned flight even manned

1560
03:34:17,639 --> 03:34:22,520
helicopters possess a robust semi-automatic mode it is simple really so

1561
03:34:22,520 --> 03:34:26,559
simple that I can continue to monitor your status and world martial

1562
03:34:26,559 --> 03:34:34,520
security from the pilot you stream crashed my computer minus two that's

1563
03:34:34,559 --> 03:34:50,899
hot why am I getting a minus two for that how is that a joke that joke wasn't

1564
03:34:50,899 --> 03:34:52,940
very funny Jericho

1565
03:34:52,940 --> 03:34:58,500
so many brains think of the data to research all and of course your

1566
03:34:58,500 --> 03:35:10,510
personal safety was a concern it's red head of the roof rocket launcher right

1567
03:35:10,510 --> 03:35:16,850
to rocket propelled grenade I'm gonna keep this on just because there's

1568
03:35:16,850 --> 03:35:30,569
helicopters and shit they don't really feel like fighting well uh all right

1569
03:35:30,569 --> 03:35:34,569
that's how you I don't know how I missed that many times but I get I

1570
03:35:34,569 --> 03:35:39,969
mean look at where that you saw that I didn't that was not me I did it it

1571
03:35:39,969 --> 03:35:54,739
was fine right what's wrong come on buddy answer me right did I still get it

1572
03:35:54,739 --> 03:36:09,299
right okay really what I went right through the damn thing use the

1573
03:36:09,299 --> 03:36:13,879
environment to your advantage I gotta get on top of here

1574
03:36:15,879 --> 03:36:33,659
you see me I don't like the spider-man villains they're annoying can I go

1575
03:36:33,659 --> 03:36:52,940
behind that guy is it possible that I could like sneak behind him I can't do

1576
03:36:52,940 --> 03:36:57,780
it from up here I can't do this from up here oh why would I have to be down

1577
03:36:57,780 --> 03:37:29,299
I could oh why why I was only just down if I hold the right stick oh I

1578
03:37:29,299 --> 03:37:35,270
know it's just it's very difficult for me to do that I feel like it's

1579
03:37:35,270 --> 03:37:37,549
harder for me to do that than just trying to aim with left stick in the

1580
03:37:38,110 --> 03:37:54,969
triangle from the or lion X what would you like me to do jump okay that's the

1581
03:37:54,969 --> 03:38:10,840
thing that's gonna stop me there are stairs why use stairs when you can

1582
03:38:10,840 --> 03:38:17,909
slice through everything it's more fun that way

1583
03:38:17,909 --> 03:38:50,739
hammer okay I can't carry that one these guys gotta go no no that's not

1584
03:38:50,739 --> 03:39:15,540
what I wanted to do that's some kind of achievement for some reason two hammer

1585
03:39:15,540 --> 03:39:21,899
guys are gonna be fun what was that magnet passing bullshit he just like

1586
03:39:21,899 --> 03:39:38,799
attached to my body why are you dark souls lock on that's bullshit the

1587
03:39:38,799 --> 03:40:31,950
guy doesn't mean poor vent okay can I go it's a ladder right come on

1588
03:40:31,950 --> 03:41:02,370

1589
03:41:06,399 --> 03:41:27,979
where are you going good dog point blank am I gonna beat the whole game

1590
03:41:27,979 --> 03:41:32,260
today that depends huh I wonder how much I'll try I'll try to get through

1591
03:41:32,260 --> 03:41:56,100
the whole thing an indicator was what the indicator was sitting oh my god

1592
03:41:56,100 --> 03:42:01,110
that was an indicator issue and I thought there was a ledge just I thought

1593
03:42:01,110 --> 03:42:10,559
that was another place to drop down a current period whatever I'm not gonna

1594
03:42:10,559 --> 03:42:51,899
complain well that's not what happened I'm just as confused as all of you are

1595
03:42:51,899 --> 03:43:06,389
okay this time go to edge but no don't go to edge I have to just go

1596
03:43:06,389 --> 03:43:12,889
over there I for some reason just saw the blip and I was like oh there's

1597
03:43:12,889 --> 03:43:55,110
probably a door down there or second I thought I did it again okay come on no

1598
03:43:55,110 --> 03:43:58,909
it's right trigger to run and I'm really good can I get both these guys

1599
03:43:58,909 --> 03:44:11,030
from far away they kill them every time am I supposed to be rescuing these

1600
03:44:11,030 --> 03:45:13,840
guys don't follow him down there hold don't oh my god

1601
03:45:13,840 --> 03:45:18,079
you cannot proceed any further via the rooftops there is a freight railroad

1602
03:45:18,079 --> 03:45:22,959
underground the elevator ahead will take you to it do it for the joke not

1603
03:45:23,079 --> 03:45:38,799
the whole thing if I do that again I swear to God I keep pressing left

1604
03:45:38,799 --> 03:46:01,090
trigger to run this must be the railroad it would appear so likely part

1605
03:46:01,090 --> 03:46:04,329
of Denver's old system couldn't just take the elevator like a normal

1606
03:46:04,329 --> 03:46:08,930
person in the early years of freight trains this particular line appears

1607
03:46:08,930 --> 03:46:13,530
to have been abandoned some time ago it was originally constructed to transport

1608
03:46:13,530 --> 03:46:18,209
supplies to an underground factory but now it seems even the electrical

1609
03:46:18,209 --> 03:46:23,049
system is no longer functioning yeah it's pitch black in here as a

1610
03:46:23,049 --> 03:46:35,020
cyborg I trust this is not a serious concern I hate this I don't hate this

1611
03:46:35,020 --> 03:47:01,340
anymore no I've never might I do hate oh get out and his enemies in here it's

1612
03:47:01,340 --> 03:47:12,540
wonderful night vision goggles can I just skip

1613
03:47:12,540 --> 03:47:27,340
fighting these guys oh okay so I should do this then all right it's

1614
03:47:27,340 --> 03:47:33,500
only it's one or the other I can't be in the box hold on wait that why they

1615
03:47:33,500 --> 03:47:44,889
can see me why can hold on a minute pitch black we can they have the same

1616
03:47:44,889 --> 03:47:56,260
items that I don't expose yourself apparently they also happen I think I

1617
03:47:56,260 --> 03:48:17,440
thought I had to be a little closer to that we just glued to my body with

1618
03:48:17,440 --> 03:48:52,879
that arm God I need to get in a better spot somewhere over here slide

1619
03:48:53,440 --> 03:49:32,420
I've dodged Lord please can I please not do this again let me just move on from

1620
03:49:32,420 --> 03:50:11,899
this please activate the train I'm you know I'm getting stuck in animations

1621
03:50:11,899 --> 03:50:14,819
that's one of the problems like I'm gonna swing swing and then I see that

1622
03:50:14,819 --> 03:50:23,049
I need to walk but I'm in the middle of a swing and I can't do is that

1623
03:50:23,049 --> 03:50:48,299
even can I I don't even know if I can block that I can't okay I thought

1624
03:50:48,379 --> 03:51:02,379
I hate this dark level fucking hell oh my god he just keeps doing it I can't

1640
03:53:44,299 --> 03:53:48,670

1641
03:53:48,670 --> 03:54:12,159

1643
03:54:30,049 --> 03:54:35,569
to do I think I can't I can't move I have to dodge you can't do any

1644
03:54:35,569 --> 03:54:41,309
animations to do anything in this game I have to not be moving to

1645
03:54:41,309 --> 03:55:17,629

1648
03:55:30,059 --> 03:55:46,139
mission get me the fuck out of here it would appear your only way forward

1649
03:55:46,139 --> 03:55:50,659
is to return to the surface you will exit into an evacuated commercial

1650
03:55:50,659 --> 03:55:55,219
district security is heavy but you need not worry about collateral damage

1651
03:55:55,219 --> 03:56:00,860
when engaging the enemy about time finally I can cut loose proceed to the

1652
03:56:00,860 --> 03:56:05,139
right from the exit you will find a stairway on your right those stairs

1653
03:56:05,139 --> 03:56:09,579
lead to a shortcut to world martial headquarters do not be distracted by

1654

1717
04:10:59,340 --> 04:11:04,860
now is it is your cause just or is that just what you tell yourself fuck

04:11:04,860 --> 04:11:11,139
you he's so bad he was into a basic enemy how pleased you are to chop

1719
04:11:11,139 --> 04:11:25,129

1722
04:11:45,920 --> 04:11:58,500
Raymond so that was the funny thing that was the thing that everyone's

1723
04:11:58,500 --> 04:12:02,979
losing their minds about does he say something feasting on the insides of

1724
04:12:02,979 --> 04:12:08,239
your enemies how easily you ignore the loss of life when it suits your

1725
04:12:08,239 --> 04:12:14,850
convenience so tell me who saves the week from the man who saves the

1726
04:12:14,889 --> 04:12:22,809
week you're the ones exploiting them you take advantage of their weakness of

1727
04:12:22,809 --> 04:12:32,020
course they get hurt when you set them up as your human shield kill or be killed

1728
04:12:32,020 --> 04:12:40,579
Jack

1729
04:12:43,579 --> 04:12:48,889
like a camera mode activated

1730
04:12:49,329 --> 04:12:54,209
its final lesson is carved deep in my psyche and this world and all its

1731
04:12:54,209 --> 04:13:01,569
people are diseased okay free will is a myth religion is a joke look right

1732
04:13:01,569 --> 04:13:05,639
controlled by something me I mean these people standing here when you

1733
04:13:05,639 --> 04:13:12,219
look right look all the way right they are the culture they are everything

1734
04:13:12,260 --> 04:13:20,040

now there's a pretty mean exquisite you just did you say that pretty mean don't

1738
04:14:05,940 --> 04:14:26,329
be ashamed it's only nature running its course the whole speech was about

1739
04:14:26,329 --> 04:14:36,110
memes about me I mean I knew something was how did I miss it I was looking at

1740
04:14:36,110 --> 04:14:39,989
the cat I could walk off the battlefield and I thought the cat was

1741
04:14:39,989 --> 04:14:45,670
the meme but here I am surrounded by death arguing philosophy with

1742
04:14:45,670 --> 04:14:50,790
terrorists I told myself this was about justice about protecting the

1743
04:14:50,790 --> 04:14:55,069
weak but I was wrong look when everybody is screaming here comes the

1744
04:14:55,069 --> 04:14:59,750
meme here comes the meme and a cat shows up on screen I learned young that's

1745
04:14:59,750 --> 04:15:02,670
the meme to me good you know what I'm saying that's that's what the joke

was in America forget the devil inside kidding I was born to kill the bit

1747
04:15:21,250 --> 04:15:27,030
about my sword that means of justice stuff I guess I needed something to

Lawrence force following Fleming's left hand rule for motors his force is

1801
04:31:25,510 --> 04:31:33,129
generated by a magnetic field I want to try I could be Raphael from the Ninja

1802
04:31:33,129 --> 04:31:40,600
Turtles and I'm gonna enhance it strength one strength two strength

1806
04:32:56,780 --> 04:33:31,310
what the hell does this thing do oh it's fake okay watch out ripper mode

1807
04:33:31,349 --> 04:33:34,720
okay

1808
04:33:56,299 --> 04:34:11,849
guess it's kind of like spider-man you got in the way you dick really how is

1809
04:34:11,849 --> 04:34:16,529
that not okay I'm a little bit confused here I'm trying to figure out

1810
04:34:16,729 --> 04:34:51,509
it was like too far away you're off the screen

1811
04:34:52,790 --> 04:35:07,540
thank that's great well that was a good in the care of that was fun

1812
04:35:07,540 --> 04:35:31,770
apparently you've wasted it somehow I got traveling two rockets and yeah it's

1813
04:35:31,810 --> 04:35:35,290
unfortunate that I just upgraded this three times I I don't I really don't

1814
04:35:35,290 --> 04:36:06,950
like it thank you classic waste all the money joke well wasn't really a joke I

1815
04:36:06,950 --> 04:36:10,959
thought it was gonna I thought it was a melee weapon I didn't think it was

1816
04:36:10,959 --> 04:36:36,319
kind of like I thought it was replacing does the staff replace the elevators

1817
04:36:36,319 --> 04:36:42,400
appear to be disabled which we should have expected I suppose I will access

1818
04:36:42,400 --> 04:36:46,599
the control unit perhaps you can hack an elevator and make it operational

1819
04:36:46,599 --> 04:36:53,599
who splendid idea by all means yes it seems the guards are storming the

1820
04:36:53,599 --> 04:37:01,919
building okay do not stray too far from the elevators right and use the

1821
04:37:01,919 --> 04:37:05,119
weapons around you to slow them down all right well I can't get them you

1822
04:37:05,119 --> 04:37:13,790
can so I might as well just use this as well yes give them hell the guy

1823
04:37:13,790 --> 04:37:19,060
already up here because it's a guy behind me is he just hitting me right

1824
04:37:19,259 --> 04:38:14,500
probably that's a dental arm I really need to be using this guy behind a

1825
04:38:14,500 --> 04:38:29,659
force field no he's just out of reach can I shoot him in the feet and kill

1826
04:38:29,659 --> 04:38:43,669
him come on why can I aim it up like half an inch higher he's still on the

1827
04:38:43,669 --> 04:39:10,459
stairs is he gonna get up console FBF well first you tell me don't leave the

1828
04:39:10,459 --> 04:39:13,419
elevator and they tell me go we go to the elevator and then you stop them

1829
04:39:13,419 --> 04:39:17,060
from getting in the elevator get in the elevator stop talking to her the

1830
04:39:17,060 --> 04:39:19,099
cutscenes

1831
04:39:19,139 --> 04:39:25,060
the lower insists of offices and meeting space for staff and visitors while

1832
04:39:25,060 --> 04:39:29,099
confidential military projects and technical research are restricted to the

1833
04:39:29,099 --> 04:39:33,259
upper levels so that's where the brains in the server room will be up top

1834
04:39:33,259 --> 04:39:39,259
indeed but that elevator can only access the lower floors you need to

1835
04:39:39,259 --> 04:39:42,700
get to the 20th floor and pass the security gate they are to reach the

1836
04:39:42,700 --> 04:39:48,220
upper area let me guess time to find another left hand well that is

1837
04:39:48,779 --> 04:39:53,459
security cyborgs would not have sufficient clearance but managers and

1838
04:39:53,459 --> 04:39:59,419
senior staff have already been evacuated no doubt so the only option is to cut

1839
04:39:59,419 --> 04:40:04,400
the power to the security gate which will not be easy it is powered by no

1840
04:40:04,400 --> 04:40:08,360
less than three systems including a backup power supply you will need to

1841
04:40:08,360 --> 04:40:12,060
destroy all of the electrical control panels to disable them in any

1842
04:40:12,099 --> 04:40:19,659
case you should arrive at the 20th floor soon a lot of grenades the

1843
04:40:19,659 --> 04:40:23,619
electrical panels are most likely hidden in the walls use your enhanced

1844
04:40:23,619 --> 04:40:28,979
AR to search for any unusual heat sources inside the walls there

1845
04:40:28,979 --> 04:40:58,659
unusual heat sources all right I'm just going in well I looked at it

1846
04:40:58,659 --> 04:41:28,189
there you go get out of the way give me my item that I just found give

1847
04:41:28,189 --> 04:42:19,740
my item oh whoops okay the heat sources rocket launchers gotta go I

1848
04:42:19,740 --> 04:42:35,740
know this where the dog come from why is it like a dog in here now okay I

1849
04:42:35,740 --> 04:43:27,380
gonna run away from me we don't know you don't too many people to parry

1850
04:43:27,380 --> 04:43:34,060
too much going on oh boy am I gonna die here I think I'm dead here I'm like

1851
04:43:34,060 --> 04:43:50,409
walking the corner I got other shit going on right yeah I can't really do

1852
04:43:50,409 --> 04:44:31,750
anything I don't I don't know where it's trying to get in space but it's

1853
04:44:31,750 --> 04:44:40,869
trying to get you to face the poster that I'm not so sure about

1854
04:44:40,990 --> 04:45:02,830
bug got on my back really all right now where do I go look for the heat heat

1855
04:45:02,830 --> 04:45:11,189
look at the heat on the walls there should be an electrical panel nearby use

1856
04:45:11,189 --> 04:45:29,819
your enhanced AR to locate it knows boxing okay sure

1857
04:45:29,819 --> 04:45:34,500
one down two to go I already see one of those I thought I would try to

1858
04:45:34,500 --> 04:45:43,860
swing it one there should be an electrical panel nearby use your

1859
04:45:43,860 --> 04:45:54,659
enhanced AR to locate it excellent just one more people coming in no all

1860
04:45:54,659 --> 04:46:42,200
right one two three that was not a pretty good that was not a good

1861
04:46:42,200 --> 04:47:16,270
telegraph right there still alive I think he's dead no little worms in there

1862
04:47:16,270 --> 04:47:47,069
my last one I thought there was one back here but I'm probably crazy

1863
04:47:47,069 --> 04:48:53,630
we go hey hurray how much more of the game do I got what's uh what's left I

1864
04:48:53,630 --> 04:49:10,139

1866
04:49:15,139 --> 04:49:21,779
way well as you wish I must say I have turned more than a few men into

1867
04:49:21,779 --> 04:49:29,259
cyborgs but you well your past is most what you getting that doc most of

1868
04:49:29,259 --> 04:49:33,740
the time you're working with first world ex-military grown men compared

1869
04:49:33,740 --> 04:49:37,500
to the average third world child soldier I can't really complain do the

1870
04:49:37,939 --> 04:49:41,500
most of them they're the sort of gorillas your typical patient gets paid to

1871
04:49:41,500 --> 04:49:50,540
slaughter this shouldn't be news to you doc look just help me take care of

1872
04:49:50,540 --> 04:49:56,380

04:52:28,040 --> 04:52:53,919
these sliders in the area let go press again that's cool I'm gonna hit right

1879
04:52:53,919 --> 04:53:04,939
in the face by something yeah keep climbing like that it will be

1880
04:53:05,500 --> 04:53:08,500
that dog

1881
04:53:16,889 --> 04:53:36,290
all right apparently I did it I got a D there I didn't do anything I didn't

1882
04:53:36,290 --> 04:53:40,330
fight anybody I couldn't build points you should find an indoor garden up

1883
04:53:40,330 --> 04:53:46,169
ahead like garden sounds fancy a Japanese garden to be precise it is an

1884
04:53:46,169 --> 04:53:51,490
area set aside for VIPs apparently one of world marshals directors is a rather

1885
04:53:51,490 --> 04:53:56,450
serious Japanese culture enthusiast all right so what's this got to do with me

1886
04:53:56,450 --> 04:54:00,930
there's something I need from the garden not at all you need only pass

1887
04:54:00,930 --> 04:54:04,930
through that area to arrive at a freight elevator I found a route to

1888
04:54:04,930 --> 04:54:09,569
the elevator controls to the unit we hijacked downstairs I have located

1889
04:54:10,009 --> 04:54:34,479
great work doc elementary my dear right now head for the garden well fight

1890
04:54:34,479 --> 04:54:58,040
apparently I don't know how the second it should shut up shut up I'm trying to

1891
04:54:58,040 --> 04:55:02,240
hit that guy too but I can't his this guy's body was getting in the way

1892
04:55:02,720 --> 04:55:36,020
die with the RPG is gonna go what point blank by an RPG why these guys down

1893
04:55:36,020 --> 04:55:39,580
here the hell do you need to be doing that for why are you done with the

1894
04:55:39,580 --> 04:56:20,340
RPG you got tired that works out for me too far away shit I mean wouldn't you

1895
04:56:20,340 --> 04:56:43,479
say something similar at this point fuck me proceed through the garden

1896
04:57:08,060 --> 04:57:19,549
so many people here I wonder what the hell I should do here cuz 5,000 damn

1897
04:57:19,549 --> 04:57:31,830
okay um what's going on that moon that is that is a very two-dimensional moon

1898
04:57:31,830 --> 04:57:48,990
can I go this way I thought I could but there was a weird invisible wall I gotta

1899
04:57:48,990 --> 04:58:42,650
say on earth is with the stealth in this game no I don't like why okay

1900
04:58:42,650 --> 04:59:00,500
it's targeting this guy well why would it turn I don't even know which

1901
04:59:00,500 --> 04:59:46,340
way I'm going which I use I need to like do something here where is this

like do we have to find these little corridors that's all there is here

1904
05:00:02,099 --> 05:00:05,099
there's no open place like it's like over here is the biggest place I

1905
05:00:05,099 --> 05:00:57,650
think gracious no don't do it keep doing that same move my god I'm gonna

this looks so long go this way my crazy or something something up here no I

1909
05:02:40,869 --> 05:02:59,360
don't have enough power shit you don't need power I thought you do

1910
05:02:59,360 --> 05:03:09,459
okay apparently don't all right all is a catwalk straight ahead to reach the

1911
05:03:09,459 --> 05:03:22,560
elevator my apologies right I seem to have fallen behind no worries actually I

1912
05:03:22,560 --> 05:03:27,959
should thank you what are you talking about if it wasn't for you I wouldn't

1913
05:03:27,959 --> 05:03:35,240
have gotten Jack back then that is your true nature more or less still

1914
05:03:35,240 --> 05:03:40,639
interested I find no reason to alter my objectives from the moment we met

1915
05:03:40,680 --> 05:03:45,840
you have acted on emotional urges you speak of protecting those weaker than

1916
05:03:45,840 --> 05:03:51,840
you such people number in the billions it is impossible you cannot save every

1917
05:03:51,840 --> 05:03:56,880
human being in the world you cannot save every street child after

1918
05:03:56,880 --> 05:04:02,560
extended observation I have come to a conclusion your actions are rooted in

1919
05:04:02,560 --> 05:04:09,119
affinity for those from similar circumstances as yours guess so not

1920
05:04:09,119 --> 05:04:13,919
much of a superhero after all huh however your emotional status is

1921
05:04:13,919 --> 05:04:19,639
understandable perhaps I share this same affinity well if that's what you

1922
05:04:19,639 --> 05:04:25,439
feel then glad to have you along Roger you can reach the server room

1923
05:04:25,439 --> 05:04:52,900
beers afraid elevator just a hair press the button but I've watched the

1924
05:04:52,900 --> 05:05:11,610
arm guys where the my like my right hand hurts I might have to take a

1925
05:05:11,610 --> 05:05:41,740
break boomer injury so it's all like the tap wait wait tap rap use the claw

1926
05:05:41,740 --> 05:05:51,759
grip oh with a game like this how are you supposed to claw grip it no it's a

1927
05:05:51,759 --> 05:06:20,770
lot of this fight this part's gonna hurt your really no I don't want a

1928
05:06:20,770 --> 05:06:40,509
part that it hurts by hand that didn't happen I think of it always hurt my

1929
05:06:40,509 --> 05:06:49,360
fucking hand oh fuck this elevator seriously do I have to fight half the

1930
05:06:49,360 --> 05:06:56,150
enemies in this game these tight-ass spaces really his enemies bigger than

1931
05:06:56,150 --> 05:07:16,310
the screen and it's a square where one of them can fit let's go thank God

1932
05:07:16,310 --> 05:07:33,500

souls at like times five speed my brain is just like slowing down get to

1938
05:09:24,959 --> 05:09:39,020

1941
05:11:10,840 --> 05:11:12,840

1944
05:12:09,099 --> 05:12:21,610
time that I want you to come on I just fat-fingered the whole entire

1945
05:12:21,610 --> 05:12:32,810
control porn in chat again well I think that's strike three guys I think

1946
05:12:32,810 --> 05:12:58,939
I'm gonna have to disable links permanently why would you baby with that

1947
05:12:58,939 --> 05:13:03,740
why would you tell me this porn in the chat we've got an issue already

1948
05:13:03,740 --> 05:13:15,779
speed why what hey we already had a good issue with that shit

1949
05:13:18,459 --> 05:13:42,150
they can't do this or I just turn it off I'm just mashing excellent by

1950
05:13:42,150 --> 05:13:59,220
the elevator sequence how do I know what porn is I went I had a class

1951
05:13:59,259 --> 05:14:19,740
when the class talked about pornography things that they talked about I don't

1952
05:14:19,740 --> 05:14:25,069
even know what enemies are fighting me right now lying around shooting missiles

1953
05:14:25,069 --> 05:14:34,840
there's three fucking vultures it's time it's time to fuck it for like a

1954
05:14:34,840 --> 05:14:38,840
grenade or something holy shit I just threw it over I threw it over boy

1955
05:14:38,840 --> 05:14:46,000
oh man what are you even supposed to do about this reliably Jesus man I

1956
05:14:46,000 --> 05:14:54,220
don't even know what the fuck I'm gonna shoot at just shoot it who

1957
05:14:54,220 --> 05:15:34,520
cares I hate these big guys I'm actually the worst

1958
05:16:34,680 --> 05:16:52,360
just kill him anything else here it was real there was a real porn why do we

1959
05:16:52,360 --> 05:16:58,159
have to have this problem now guys I've had links in chat for almost three

1960
05:16:58,159 --> 05:17:02,959
or four years server rooms ahead yes and you tell me that three years later

1961
05:17:02,959 --> 05:17:07,240
I expect to find if they're VR training those brains I'm guessing it

1962
05:17:07,240 --> 05:17:11,400
won't look like your typical IT department quite right most of it

1963
05:17:11,400 --> 05:17:15,319
will likely be occupied by life support units feeding oxygen and

1964
05:17:15,319 --> 05:17:18,439
nutrition to the brains they have stored you know they would also need

1965
05:17:18,439 --> 05:17:22,880
a server to feed them to be our data but in terms of structure it's

1966
05:17:22,880 --> 05:17:29,720
really more brain storage but no doubt it makes a convenient euphemism for what

1967
05:17:29,720 --> 05:17:34,520
they are really doing there yeah like how CIA agents refer to where they work

1968
05:17:34,520 --> 05:17:38,919
as the company indeed something like that would never arouse the

1969
05:17:38,919 --> 05:17:42,840
suspicions of rank-and-file staff who may hear it and I'm sure those

1970
05:17:42,840 --> 05:17:47,279
complicit in this operation feel better not calling it the VR training

1971
05:17:47,279 --> 05:17:52,159
room even something so simple as a name can help one ignore the truth of

1972
05:17:52,159 --> 05:17:57,639
what they are doing truly fascinating how the human brain works so this whatever

1973
05:17:57,639 --> 05:18:02,599
room that's where sundowners waiting right if he wants a fight I wish he'd

1974
05:18:02,599 --> 05:18:05,639
just get on with it he didn't seem the time to run and

1975
05:18:05,639 --> 05:18:10,639
hide then he is in charge of security but I suspect this is not about

1976
05:18:10,639 --> 05:18:15,319
business if I had to guess I would say he's toying with you testing you

1977
05:18:15,319 --> 05:18:19,319
perhaps whatever he's doing it won't change what's going to happen once I

1978
05:18:19,319 --> 05:18:24,279
finally catch up with them all right so give me a second I gotta like get a

1979
05:18:24,279 --> 05:18:28,560
glass of water I get to break I'll be back in like two minutes I'm gonna pee

1980
05:18:28,560 --> 05:18:33,959
grab a jar of water this is this is this games like lighting my neurons up

1981
05:18:33,959 --> 05:18:41,279
in my brain no porn links in this chat if this if I come back there's

1982
05:18:41,279 --> 05:18:50,049
a porn link you're all in deep shit don't don't do that I'll be right

1983
05:18:50,049 --> 05:22:13,139
back all right hello change like the lighting in here I think the

1984
05:22:13,139 --> 05:22:18,290
lighting is like fucking with my head they'd have like the ideal lighting

1985
05:22:18,290 --> 05:22:39,500
what was ideal lighting I don't know all right hello yeah I just needed to

1986
05:22:39,500 --> 05:22:45,810
take a second this game is this game's a lot of fun but it's kind of

1987
05:22:45,810 --> 05:22:53,139
like I'm melting and at some point it's just like

1988
05:22:57,139 --> 05:23:08,270
fires off a lot of shit in the brain really fast I think it's a good game

1989
05:23:08,310 --> 05:23:26,830
brain can't take it I think I'm good though I just needed to look away for it

1990
05:23:26,830 --> 05:23:37,689
from it for like a minute or two grab some water you know chill how you think

1991
05:23:37,689 --> 05:23:46,650
secure I was gonna feel definitely a lot slower than this but I don't know

1992
05:23:46,650 --> 05:23:54,250
it's it's kind of the same realm as the early games right I think the

1993
05:23:54,250 --> 05:23:58,729
sound design makes it really overwhelming yeah we'll see if I can

1994
05:23:58,729 --> 05:24:18,709
do the whole game

1995
05:24:25,509 --> 05:24:35,150
well got it they're all getting back on top of her head I gotta kill them all

1996
05:24:35,150 --> 05:24:38,470
before they get back she has a good I don't know what the hell's happening

1997
05:24:38,470 --> 05:24:51,029
I'll take it I'll take the victory BD so I gotta fight this this isn't like

1998
05:24:51,029 --> 05:25:08,099
a boss brush is it this is boss brush don't let her get it I don't really

1999
05:25:08,099 --> 05:25:23,900

2000
05:25:24,500 --> 05:26:07,290

2002
05:26:24,220 --> 05:26:28,180

sorry I'm sorry I do I just said I'm sorry this thing's up there

2014
05:30:29,360 --> 05:30:41,340
late mode is not meant for dealing damage you know I use blade mo because

2015
05:30:41,340 --> 05:30:47,400
it makes me feel safe it's so slow don't disrupt the students while class

2016
05:30:47,400 --> 05:30:54,060
is in session I believe familiar with the lesson plan the same regimen you

went through in Liberia right is fighting this guy program just look

2018
05:30:58,740 --> 05:31:04,380
how you turned out of course running it in the real world just got a bit

2019
05:31:04,419 --> 05:31:07,380
you missed a diamond

2020
05:31:08,459 --> 05:31:14,619
virtually though no fuss no must straight to the brain

2021
05:31:14,619 --> 05:31:24,500
it's like a dream well maybe dream is the wrong word to kill some POWs some

2022
05:31:24,500 --> 05:31:35,740
civilians we give their pleasure centers nice big joke every time plus

05:31:57,220 --> 05:32:01,939
lose touch with it as they get older start thinking they know right wrong

2027
05:32:02,259 --> 05:32:10,700
that's immoral war crime this code of conduct that kids you can mold

2028
05:32:10,700 --> 05:32:16,139
manipulate it performing all kinds of atrocities and there's nothing like a

2029
05:32:16,139 --> 05:32:24,229
good atrocity to keep a war going that's why I'm shutting you down you

2030
05:32:24,229 --> 05:32:33,930
just don't see the bigger picture do you say you bring this whole place

2031
05:32:34,810 --> 05:32:41,340
what's out of the rubble with all these precious brains

2032
05:32:41,340 --> 05:32:51,669
nothing changes all the guys in charge of long gone we've got offices around

2033

just support we don't create the market for war and who does the

2035
05:33:06,810 --> 05:33:13,970
patriots are gone those guys just manage the war economy they did not

2036
05:33:13,970 --> 05:33:19,729
create it did you think every battle in history was all part of some big

2037
05:33:19,729 --> 05:33:29,830
old conspiracy bullshit war is just part of who we are why fight it

2038
05:33:29,830 --> 05:33:35,119
none of this will matter in three hours demand for PMC's is about to

2039
05:33:35,119 --> 05:33:42,860

2047
05:35:15,860 --> 05:35:20,810
one of those second to last areas hopefully just don't put me all the

2048
05:35:20,930 --> 05:36:00,520
bird up why did I read that okay fuel cells they're all good I'm gonna go to

05:36:46,860 --> 05:36:56,750
few times really need it then I have enough for one of the skills right

2053
05:36:56,750 --> 05:37:16,970
Thunderstrike channel air pressure into a shockwave sure and sweep kick let

2054
05:37:16,970 --> 05:37:35,349
me see what this does right then get sundowner hold on let me just take a

2055

2063
05:39:38,150 --> 05:39:50,130
too paranoid about that okey-dokey we need to go up here

2064
05:39:50,130 --> 05:40:02,770

2067
05:40:29,340 --> 05:40:36,259
talking you're too late even at Mach 2 you wouldn't make it kill it that was

2068
05:40:36,259 --> 05:40:42,380
a joke take some time what happened in three hours

2069
05:40:42,380 --> 05:40:51,819
I don't want to hear that again this whole game is a joke take those back

2070

2074
05:41:54,419 --> 05:41:56,700

05:44:54,500 --> 05:45:25,150
the indicator again no I'm just like brain right do it here we go okay now

2085
05:45:25,150 --> 05:45:36,020
I'm gonna cut here I mean I the fucking right stick I gotta get it next time

2086
05:45:36,020 --> 05:45:43,590
I just I don't have enough for it I pressed like right stick and it was like

2087
05:45:43,590 --> 05:45:47,069
we didn't have it and like flipped all over the place

2088
05:45:47,069 --> 05:45:51,069
I might as well just die and just do it again don't do it, just try it next time

2089
05:45:51,069 --> 05:46:07,330
do I have enable heals?

2090
05:46:07,330 --> 05:46:09,330
I know

2091
05:46:09,330 --> 05:46:11,330
you're not gonna be able to help me

2092
05:46:11,330 --> 05:46:13,330
yeah I'll just do it again

2093
05:46:13,330 --> 05:46:19,680
to be stronger than this you can be cooler than that

2094
05:46:19,680 --> 05:46:21,680
Jack

2095
05:46:21,680 --> 05:46:26,990
die you stupid helicopter

2096
05:46:26,990 --> 05:46:28,990
you're here for no reason

2097
05:46:28,990 --> 05:46:32,639
I mean maybe it was like part of the fight or something

2098
05:46:32,639 --> 05:46:34,639
no it's just here

2099
05:46:34,639 --> 05:46:42,340
no I hit fucking X why?

2100
05:46:42,340 --> 05:46:44,340
I just pressed X and E

2101
05:46:44,340 --> 05:46:46,509
I didn't

2102
05:46:46,509 --> 05:46:48,509
gamer fatigue is setting in

2103
05:46:48,509 --> 05:46:50,509
like just straight up gamer fatigue

2104
05:46:50,509 --> 05:46:52,509
maybe you can drop his gun

2105
05:46:52,509 --> 05:46:56,029
what is this fucking swing here

2106
05:47:15,939 --> 05:47:25,409
really?

2107
05:47:25,409 --> 05:47:27,409
where am I?

2108
05:47:27,409 --> 05:47:37,200
what the fuck?

2109
05:47:37,200 --> 05:47:41,200
this is so easy this is the easiest boss fight in the whole entire fucking game

2110
05:47:41,200 --> 05:47:51,709
and just me aiming with the right stick somehow is impossible

2111
05:47:51,709 --> 05:47:53,709
like I'm so close to him

2112
05:47:53,709 --> 05:48:02,159
what the fuck

2113
05:48:02,159 --> 05:48:04,159
like look at how close this is

2114
05:48:04,159 --> 05:48:15,549
come on again

2115
05:48:15,549 --> 05:48:25,090
help me right here

2116
05:48:25,090 --> 05:48:27,090
he's trying to not hit, no I'm not

2117
05:48:27,090 --> 05:48:29,090
I'm just playing this game for 6 hours

2118
05:48:29,090 --> 05:48:56,159
it just drains your body

2119
05:48:56,159 --> 05:49:01,020
oh god damn he's back

2120
05:49:01,020 --> 05:49:16,509
fucking helicopter here

2121
05:49:16,509 --> 05:49:19,069
seriously

2122
05:49:19,069 --> 05:49:25,659
are you gonna do this?

2123
05:49:25,659 --> 05:49:28,290
what are you doing with that man?

2124
05:49:37,139 --> 05:49:44,430
he'll be back

2125
05:49:44,430 --> 05:49:46,430
time's over jack

2126
05:49:46,430 --> 05:49:48,799
time to die

2127
05:49:48,799 --> 05:49:50,799
so that is part of the game

2128
05:49:50,799 --> 05:50:13,389
another run on the side of the building

2129
05:50:13,389 --> 05:50:15,950
I'm gonna be very very

2130
05:50:15,950 --> 05:50:31,500
fly along the side of the building

2131
05:50:31,500 --> 05:50:48,849
that hurt

2132
05:50:48,849 --> 05:50:50,849
I guess I'll come in

2133
05:50:50,849 --> 05:50:53,020
I thought it was gonna be one cut

2134
05:50:53,020 --> 05:50:55,020
I thought it was gonna be one cut

2135
05:50:55,020 --> 05:51:00,209
come on give me it

2136
05:51:00,209 --> 05:51:11,860
alright I made it

2137
05:51:11,860 --> 05:51:37,950
it's over

2138
05:51:37,950 --> 05:51:44,990
it's over

2139
05:51:44,990 --> 05:51:46,990
what? jack?

2140
05:51:46,990 --> 05:51:48,990
what happens in 3 hours?

2141
05:51:48,990 --> 05:51:50,990
he'll launch

2142
05:51:50,990 --> 05:51:52,990
operation

2143
05:51:52,990 --> 05:51:54,990
to cum se

2144
05:51:54,990 --> 05:51:56,990
who?

2145
05:51:56,990 --> 05:51:58,990
armstrong

2146
05:51:58,990 --> 05:52:00,990
armstrong has too much

2147
05:52:00,990 --> 05:52:04,319
have a call

2148
05:52:04,319 --> 05:52:06,319
to make

2149
05:52:06,319 --> 05:52:08,319
got yourself shaving?

2150
05:52:10,319 --> 05:52:12,319
asshole

2151
05:52:12,319 --> 05:52:21,069
real

2152
05:52:21,069 --> 05:52:23,069
you knew this would happen

2153
05:52:23,069 --> 05:52:25,069
didn't you?

2154
05:52:25,069 --> 05:52:29,409
well

2155
05:52:29,409 --> 05:52:31,409
you'll get your wish

2156
05:52:31,409 --> 05:52:34,029
up to you now

2157
05:52:34,029 --> 05:52:39,020
final boss incoming

2158
05:52:39,020 --> 05:52:41,020
I've taken martial HQ

2159
05:52:41,020 --> 05:52:43,020
final boss

2160
05:52:43,020 --> 05:52:45,020
incoming

2161
05:52:45,020 --> 05:52:47,020
hurry

2162
05:52:47,020 --> 05:52:49,020
what sundowner said?

2163
05:52:49,020 --> 05:52:51,020
I know

2164
05:52:51,020 --> 05:52:53,020
anything that'll rival 9-11

2165
05:52:53,020 --> 05:52:55,020
cannot be good

2166
05:52:55,020 --> 05:52:57,330
maybe less

2167
05:52:57,330 --> 05:52:59,330
he said even maktu could not get there in time

2168
05:52:59,330 --> 05:53:01,330
if he was serious that's

2169
05:53:01,330 --> 05:53:03,330
over 4000 miles away

2170
05:53:03,330 --> 05:53:05,330
4500

2171
05:53:05,330 --> 05:53:07,330
so whatever it is it's not happening on American soil

2172
05:53:07,330 --> 05:53:09,330
if it's gonna spike demand

2173
05:53:09,330 --> 05:53:11,330
for PMC's it's gotta be a political hot spot

2174
05:53:11,330 --> 05:53:13,330
a coup or civil war

2175
05:53:13,330 --> 05:53:15,330
in a stable region wouldn't have a domino effect

2176
05:53:15,330 --> 05:53:17,330
and they'd want to draw in a super power

2177
05:53:17,330 --> 05:53:21,540
what?

2178
05:53:21,540 --> 05:53:23,540
president

2179
05:53:23,540 --> 05:53:25,540
he's on his way to Pakistan

2180
05:53:25,540 --> 05:53:27,540
what happens to him there?

2181
05:53:27,540 --> 05:53:29,540
oh shit

2182
05:53:29,540 --> 05:53:31,540
the war on terror part two

2183
05:53:31,540 --> 05:53:33,540
contact the military

2184
05:53:33,540 --> 05:53:35,540
official channels are frozen since Mexico

2185
05:53:35,540 --> 05:53:37,540
unofficial channels would take too long

2186
05:53:37,540 --> 05:53:39,540
besides what's our proof?

2187
05:53:39,540 --> 05:53:41,540
who's gonna believe us over world marsh?

2188
05:53:41,540 --> 05:53:43,540
then we have to get there first

2189
05:53:43,540 --> 05:53:45,540
impossible

2190
05:53:45,540 --> 05:53:47,540
it is the other side of the planet

2191
05:53:47,540 --> 05:53:49,540
even if we were in the world's fastest jet right now

2192
05:53:49,540 --> 05:53:51,540
it's not even close

2193
05:53:51,540 --> 05:53:53,540
hold up

2194
05:53:53,540 --> 05:53:55,779
did you get me?

2195
05:54:16,060 --> 05:54:18,060
it's fast

2196
05:54:18,060 --> 05:54:22,419
it's really fast

2197
05:54:22,419 --> 05:54:25,549
b-a-d-a-c-b-c-s-a-v

2198
05:54:25,549 --> 05:54:27,549
that's all over the place

2199
05:54:27,549 --> 05:54:29,549
I took that test drunk

2200
05:54:29,549 --> 05:54:47,150
custom cyborg party

2201
05:54:47,150 --> 05:54:49,520
okay

2202
05:54:49,520 --> 05:54:52,209
I got his weapons

2203
05:54:52,209 --> 05:54:54,450
and his armor

2204
05:54:54,450 --> 05:55:12,740
how much is it?

2205
05:55:12,740 --> 05:55:14,740
custom cyborg 15,000

2206
05:55:14,740 --> 05:55:23,810
so what's the difference here?

2207
05:55:23,810 --> 05:55:27,520
I don't have enough to do that

2208
05:55:27,520 --> 05:55:32,580
just a different color

2209
05:55:32,580 --> 05:55:39,740
well what's the weapon?

2210
05:55:39,740 --> 05:55:41,740
pincer blades

2211
05:55:41,740 --> 05:55:43,740
pair of giant high frequency machetes

2212
05:55:43,740 --> 05:55:45,740
that can be combined to form massive shears

2213
05:55:45,740 --> 05:55:47,740
so in motion they are particularly effective

2214
05:55:47,740 --> 05:55:49,740
at catching their prey off guard

2215
05:55:49,740 --> 05:55:51,979
developed after careful analysis

2216
05:55:51,979 --> 05:55:53,979
of sundowners battle data

2217
05:55:53,979 --> 05:56:03,759
10,000?

2218
05:56:03,759 --> 05:56:06,700
not good, I wonder if they're good

2219
05:56:06,700 --> 05:56:10,479
I'm gonna try it

2220
05:56:10,479 --> 05:56:12,479
I'm not gonna put the upgrades on it yet

2221
05:56:12,479 --> 05:56:14,479
but I am gonna know I'm not

2222
05:56:14,479 --> 05:56:19,599
because it's 40,000

2223
05:56:19,599 --> 05:56:30,139
turbulence

2224
05:56:30,139 --> 05:56:33,020
I don't have enough, I need to level up

2225
05:56:58,080 --> 05:57:00,700
man of many talents

2226
05:57:00,700 --> 05:57:09,580
this kind of

2227
05:57:09,580 --> 05:57:11,580
space launch once required days

2228
05:57:11,580 --> 05:57:13,580
of preparation

2229
05:57:13,580 --> 05:57:15,580
solus has been conducting test flights almost every day for the last

2230
05:57:15,580 --> 05:57:17,580
six months

2231
05:57:17,580 --> 05:57:19,580
as long as we're not breaking atmosphere

2232
05:57:19,580 --> 05:57:21,580
they said they can reroute today's flight no problem

2233
05:57:21,580 --> 05:57:23,580
amazing

2234
05:57:23,580 --> 05:57:25,580
the earth is the cradle of humanity

2235
05:57:25,580 --> 05:57:27,580
but mankind cannot stay in the cradle forever

2236
05:57:27,580 --> 05:57:29,580
I'm only going as far as the

2237
05:57:29,580 --> 05:57:31,580
thermosphere

2238
05:57:31,580 --> 05:57:33,580
this thing can't pass the karman line

2239
05:57:33,580 --> 05:57:35,580
this mission will just have to wait

2240
05:57:35,580 --> 05:57:37,580
and here I was hoping you might bring me back

2241
05:57:37,580 --> 05:57:40,459
a monolith

2242
05:57:40,459 --> 05:57:42,459
scheisse, two bogeys closing fast

2243
05:57:42,459 --> 05:57:44,459
uh oh

2244
05:57:44,459 --> 05:57:46,459
who else? the flight pattern suggests

2245
05:57:46,459 --> 05:57:48,459
unmanned incorporate 20s

2246
05:57:48,459 --> 05:57:56,659
this is a transport chopper

2247
05:57:56,659 --> 05:57:58,659
our defensive options are limited

2248
05:57:58,659 --> 05:58:00,659
I didn't say sam, I said saaam

2249
05:58:00,659 --> 05:58:02,659
with a capital

2250
05:58:02,659 --> 05:58:04,659
M

2251
05:58:04,659 --> 05:58:06,659
missiles incoming

2252
05:58:06,659 --> 05:58:20,610
yes, but not

2253
05:58:20,610 --> 05:58:22,610
I'm strong enough to kick out the drone

2254
05:58:30,740 --> 05:58:35,279
here they come

2255
05:58:35,279 --> 05:58:37,970
this? I didn't

2256
05:58:37,970 --> 05:58:40,459
have a nice flight

2257
05:58:40,459 --> 05:58:42,459
and people say Germans aren't funny

2258
05:58:42,459 --> 05:58:45,470
when did I say that?

2259
05:58:45,470 --> 05:59:03,650
one guy said that

2260
05:59:03,650 --> 05:59:05,650
there it is

2261
05:59:10,720 --> 05:59:12,720
alright, bring the chopper around

2262
05:59:12,720 --> 06:00:01,360
this is easier said than done

2263
06:00:01,360 --> 06:00:03,360
you know

2264
06:00:03,360 --> 06:00:05,659
do you mind living with me?

2265
06:00:05,659 --> 06:00:18,020
yeah sure

2266
06:00:18,020 --> 06:00:20,020
yeah sure

2267
06:00:20,020 --> 06:00:28,659
yeah sure

2268
06:00:28,659 --> 06:00:56,619
nooooo

2269
06:00:56,619 --> 06:00:59,630
I got out of here

2270
06:00:59,630 --> 06:01:01,630
I'm sorry my friend

2271
06:01:01,630 --> 06:01:03,630
your sacrifice will not be forgotten

2272
06:01:05,630 --> 06:01:14,979
that was quite the fall Raiden

2273
06:01:14,979 --> 06:01:16,979
I'm glad to see that you are alright

2274
06:01:16,979 --> 06:01:18,979
it's time you got out of

2275
06:01:18,979 --> 06:01:21,790
Denver

2276
06:01:21,790 --> 06:01:29,220
enemies

2277
06:01:29,220 --> 06:01:31,650
clean out

2278
06:01:31,650 --> 06:01:35,680
I'll take it

2279
06:01:35,680 --> 06:01:37,680
play as a docker

2280
06:01:37,680 --> 06:01:40,110
wouldn't that be something

2281
06:01:40,110 --> 06:01:42,110
if there wasn't a guy behind me

2282
06:01:42,110 --> 06:01:44,110
I would have got that guy in one hells world

2283
06:01:44,110 --> 06:01:47,439
I'm not even getting the right guy

2284
06:01:47,439 --> 06:01:59,919
use pincher?

2285
06:01:59,919 --> 06:02:01,919
well I didn't really get a chance to

2286
06:02:01,919 --> 06:02:03,919
go into my menu

2287
06:02:03,919 --> 06:02:05,919
I kind of got attacked immediately

2288
06:02:05,919 --> 06:02:07,919
oops

2289
06:02:07,919 --> 06:02:17,389
oops

2290
06:02:17,389 --> 06:02:24,990
so it is on

2291
06:02:24,990 --> 06:02:26,990
I can charge up

2292
06:02:26,990 --> 06:02:28,990
there's a slow

2293
06:02:28,990 --> 06:02:30,990
can people stop calling me?

2294
06:02:30,990 --> 06:02:32,990
Mike can you talk to me on the move?

2295
06:02:54,990 --> 06:02:56,990
I know

2296
06:02:56,990 --> 06:02:58,990
let me just worry about putting some distance

2297
06:02:58,990 --> 06:03:00,990
between me and world marshal

2298
06:03:00,990 --> 06:03:04,830
and what's left of it

2299
06:03:04,830 --> 06:03:06,830
you could have emailed that to me

2300
06:03:06,830 --> 06:03:09,259
I'm a 20 billion dollar

2301
06:03:09,259 --> 06:03:11,259
cyber ninja

2302
06:03:11,259 --> 06:03:13,259
okay

2303
06:03:13,259 --> 06:03:15,259
you can email me that and it'll just download into my brain

2304
06:03:15,259 --> 06:03:17,259
and I won't even need to hear you talk

2305
06:03:17,259 --> 06:03:31,919
okay well I'm turning this shit on

2306
06:03:31,919 --> 06:03:40,880
and that whole animation

2307
06:03:40,880 --> 06:03:42,880
lasts too long

2308
06:03:42,880 --> 06:03:44,880
to the point where now I get a fight

2309
06:03:44,880 --> 06:03:50,509
why does it need to do that?

2310
06:03:50,509 --> 06:04:22,259
get off the lock on there

2311
06:04:22,259 --> 06:04:26,860
get off that lock on

2312
06:04:26,860 --> 06:04:28,860
well I

2313
06:04:28,860 --> 06:04:44,099
those are very slow aren't they?

2314
06:04:50,110 --> 06:04:52,799
and now you're in big trouble

2315
06:04:52,799 --> 06:05:01,889
two heals

2316
06:05:01,889 --> 06:05:03,889
that's not good

2317
06:05:03,889 --> 06:05:23,569
no

2318
06:05:23,569 --> 06:05:33,360
I'm not sure I like these

2319
06:05:33,360 --> 06:05:35,360
these might be too slow in a game that's this fast

2320
06:05:35,360 --> 06:05:37,979
it's kind of hard to use them

2321
06:05:37,979 --> 06:05:47,630
where's my AR?

2322
06:05:47,630 --> 06:05:50,830
yeah

2323
06:05:50,830 --> 06:06:01,970
I couldn't even do it

2324
06:06:01,970 --> 06:06:06,619
just tried to do it you heard it

2325
06:06:06,619 --> 06:06:08,619
voice just got cracked right there

2326
06:06:08,619 --> 06:06:26,860
oh Jeremy

2327
06:06:26,860 --> 06:06:28,860
you got it

2328
06:06:28,860 --> 06:06:32,580
you got the arm on purpose

2329
06:06:32,580 --> 06:06:42,880
I tried

2330
06:06:42,880 --> 06:06:44,880
actually here's why those things are not terrible

2331
06:06:44,880 --> 06:06:46,880
because they can hit more than one person at a time

2332
06:06:46,880 --> 06:06:53,139
nice work Jeremy

2333
06:06:53,139 --> 06:06:55,759
you did a great job

2334
06:06:55,759 --> 06:07:20,209
I'm doing fine it's okay

2335
06:07:20,209 --> 06:07:22,209
Jeremy makes less jokes and he enjoys a game

2336
06:07:22,209 --> 06:07:24,509
um

2337
06:07:24,509 --> 06:07:26,509
I don't know if

2338
06:07:26,509 --> 06:07:28,509
it's just hard to talk and play at the same time

2339
06:07:28,509 --> 06:07:31,459
you know what I mean?

2340
06:07:31,459 --> 06:07:34,400
when there's a bunch of enemies on screen

2341
06:07:34,400 --> 06:07:36,400
it's like

2342
06:07:38,400 --> 06:07:40,400
I can't be like

2343
06:07:40,400 --> 06:07:42,400
I was at the grocery store yesterday

2344
06:07:42,400 --> 06:07:44,400
let me tell you something

2345
06:07:44,400 --> 06:07:53,040
hates game? what?

2346
06:07:53,040 --> 06:07:55,040
when did you hear that?

2347
06:07:55,040 --> 06:07:57,040
when did I say hate game?

2348
06:07:57,040 --> 06:07:59,470
I would not be streaming

2349
06:07:59,470 --> 06:08:01,470
I would not be playing this game for more than 6 hours

2350
06:08:01,470 --> 06:08:03,470
if I hated the game

2351
06:08:03,470 --> 06:08:05,650
what?

2352
06:08:05,650 --> 06:08:08,400
no

2353
06:08:08,400 --> 06:08:10,400
I think it's fun

2354
06:08:10,400 --> 06:08:13,659
I wouldn't be playing it if I didn't think that

2355
06:08:13,659 --> 06:08:15,659
and by the way let me tell you something

2356
06:08:15,659 --> 06:08:17,659
I went to see infinity war for like the 34th time

2357
06:08:17,659 --> 06:08:19,659
I saw infinity war

2358
06:08:19,659 --> 06:08:21,659
for every single year that I've been live

2359
06:08:21,659 --> 06:08:23,659
because I had to

2360
06:08:23,659 --> 06:08:25,659
and I'm in line

2361
06:08:25,659 --> 06:08:27,659
and let me tell you something

2362
06:08:27,659 --> 06:08:29,659
popcorn? fucking expensive

2363
06:08:29,659 --> 06:08:31,659
it's like the airlines

2364
06:08:31,659 --> 06:08:33,659
you know what I mean? when you go to the movie theater

2365
06:08:33,659 --> 06:08:35,659
essentially you're going to an entertainment airline

2366
06:08:35,659 --> 06:08:43,599
you know what I mean?

2367
06:08:43,599 --> 06:08:46,669
they charge so much but here's the difference

2368
06:08:46,669 --> 06:08:51,090
alright I gotta stop that

2369
06:08:51,090 --> 06:08:53,090
somebody just said shut up

2370
06:08:53,090 --> 06:08:55,459
you see? you know what I mean?

2371
06:08:55,459 --> 06:08:57,459
you know what I mean? you know what I mean?

2372
06:08:57,459 --> 06:09:02,189
one guy said that

2373
06:09:02,189 --> 06:09:04,189
yeah but there's still one guy that's angry

2374
06:09:04,189 --> 06:09:06,189
that I just did that

2375
06:09:06,189 --> 06:09:08,189
activate the vac system

2376
06:09:08,189 --> 06:09:25,090
every time I activate this I fall down

2377
06:09:25,090 --> 06:09:30,529
you guys are going to have to have like a vote

2378
06:09:30,529 --> 06:09:32,529
amongst yourselves here

2379
06:09:32,529 --> 06:09:36,430
Jerma talk, Jerma don't talk

2380
06:09:36,430 --> 06:09:38,430
hey you shut up, be quiet

2381
06:09:38,430 --> 06:09:40,430
why aren't you talking? we're the jokes

2382
06:09:40,430 --> 06:09:42,799
pay attention

2383
06:09:42,799 --> 06:09:45,360
do we have like a poll in chat here?

2384
06:09:45,360 --> 06:09:56,369
I hate you guys so much

2385
06:09:56,369 --> 06:09:58,930

2386
06:09:58,930 --> 06:10:02,130

2387
06:10:02,130 --> 06:10:04,130
ow my stomach

2388
06:10:04,130 --> 06:10:06,369

2389
06:10:06,369 --> 06:10:08,369

I'm talking about the enemies, the vultures

2393
06:10:14,610 --> 06:10:22,990
I'm not talking about

2394
06:10:22,990 --> 06:10:32,509
you guys

2395
06:10:32,509 --> 06:10:35,009

2396
06:10:35,009 --> 06:10:37,009
vulture guy, I hate them

2397
06:10:37,009 --> 06:10:41,939

2398
06:10:41,939 --> 06:10:43,939

2399
06:10:43,939 --> 06:10:46,880

2400
06:10:46,880 --> 06:10:48,880
let me see that clip

2401
06:10:48,880 --> 06:10:50,880
I want to hear how fucking bad that was

2402
06:10:50,880 --> 06:10:52,880
that probably sounded

2403
06:10:52,880 --> 06:10:55,119
so bad

2404
06:10:55,119 --> 06:10:59,090
ugh

2405
06:10:59,090 --> 06:11:03,099
oh no

2406
06:11:03,099 --> 06:11:07,650
they gotta get the whole thing there

2407
06:11:07,650 --> 06:11:12,060
ugh

2408
06:11:12,060 --> 06:11:14,060
I'm losing viewers now

2409
06:11:14,060 --> 06:11:18,159
that's not what I meant, y'all know it, come on

2410
06:11:18,159 --> 06:11:26,909
holy shit that was bad

2411
06:11:26,909 --> 06:11:28,909
wait are people actually leaving

2412
06:11:28,909 --> 06:11:30,909
because they thought that's what I was saying

2413
06:11:30,909 --> 06:11:44,220
it was actually

2414
06:11:44,220 --> 06:12:11,169
somewhere there's somebody that really thought

2415
06:12:11,169 --> 06:12:13,169
because I did just say

2416
06:12:13,169 --> 06:12:15,169
something about chat and stuff

2417
06:12:15,169 --> 06:12:17,169
what do you want me to do

2418
06:12:17,169 --> 06:12:19,169
ugh that came out so bad

2419
06:12:19,169 --> 06:12:21,599
all the fucking vultures

2420
06:12:21,599 --> 06:12:30,560
you got a dragon ball

2421
06:12:30,560 --> 06:12:42,529
in your face

2422
06:12:42,529 --> 06:12:44,529
alright now don't fuck this up

2423
06:12:44,529 --> 06:12:46,529
it's gonna go up

2424
06:12:46,529 --> 06:12:48,529
and do it again

2425
06:12:48,529 --> 06:12:54,340
we need an apology statement

2426
06:12:54,340 --> 06:12:57,470
well I'm sorry that you may have

2427
06:12:57,470 --> 06:12:59,470
thought that's what I said

2428
06:12:59,470 --> 06:13:10,540
that's not what I said

2429
06:13:10,540 --> 06:13:15,340
wait cut car in half, doesn't make you happy right?

2430
06:13:19,360 --> 06:13:21,360
can't even cut the car in half

2431
06:13:21,360 --> 06:13:24,299
how am I supposed to make everybody happy

2432
06:13:24,299 --> 06:13:26,299
nice non apology

2433
06:13:30,299 --> 06:13:32,299
that's making me laugh

2434
06:13:37,169 --> 06:13:39,169
ugh

2435
06:13:39,169 --> 06:13:49,090
that's what I said I hated these enemies

2436
06:13:49,090 --> 06:13:57,520
look at me now

2437
06:13:57,520 --> 06:13:59,520
I've come to have a lot of perspective

2438
06:13:59,520 --> 06:14:05,919
you know what I mean

2439
06:14:05,919 --> 06:14:19,419
I got two here

2440
06:14:19,419 --> 06:14:21,419
the whole point of the segment is to show how much better you are now

2441
06:14:21,419 --> 06:14:24,500
I mean I feel like I

2442
06:14:24,500 --> 06:14:28,020
have been brewing a lot

2443
06:14:28,020 --> 06:14:30,020
the whole point right?

2444
06:14:30,020 --> 06:14:32,020
you can't be a top number one

2445
06:14:32,020 --> 06:14:34,020
video game player

2446
06:14:34,020 --> 06:14:36,020
you gotta get the muscle

2447
06:14:36,020 --> 06:14:38,020
memory you gotta fucking drink some water

2448
06:14:38,020 --> 06:14:40,020
you gotta accidentally press L2

2449
06:14:40,020 --> 06:14:42,020
twice by the way

2450
06:14:42,020 --> 06:14:53,540
twice

2451
06:14:53,540 --> 06:15:00,830
who's still around?

2452
06:15:00,830 --> 06:15:03,459
who's this?

2453
06:15:03,459 --> 06:15:05,819

2456
06:15:14,419 --> 06:15:16,419
for the next six years

2457
06:15:16,419 --> 06:15:20,380
people are gonna take the whole clip and be like

2458
06:15:20,380 --> 06:15:22,380

2459
06:15:47,500 --> 06:15:57,020

2460
06:15:57,020 --> 06:15:59,020
watch the actual clip

2461
06:15:59,020 --> 06:16:01,020
does somebody have a full one?

2462
06:16:01,020 --> 06:16:12,930
nice chapter okay?

2463
06:16:12,930 --> 06:16:15,229
the truth comes out

2464
06:16:15,229 --> 06:16:17,229
is this the right one?

2465
06:16:17,229 --> 06:16:20,299
pull?

2466
06:16:20,299 --> 06:16:22,299
I gotta hear how bad this is

2467
06:16:22,299 --> 06:16:24,299
the whole thing

2468
06:16:24,299 --> 06:16:26,299
I have like a pull in chat here

2469
06:16:26,299 --> 06:16:37,500
no no no

2470
06:16:37,500 --> 06:16:51,580
it's not

2471
06:16:51,580 --> 06:16:53,580
it's too late

2472
06:16:53,580 --> 06:16:55,580
it's too late for me

2473
06:16:55,580 --> 06:16:58,319
it's too late

2474
06:16:58,319 --> 06:17:00,319
it's really so bad

2475
06:17:09,889 --> 06:17:11,889
there it is

2476
06:17:11,889 --> 06:17:13,889
the career is over

2477
06:17:13,889 --> 06:17:17,979
I wanna use these

2478
06:17:17,979 --> 06:17:23,299
I feel like I could use these if I start to actually play

2479
06:17:23,299 --> 06:17:26,500
I want the skill with them too

2480
06:17:26,500 --> 06:17:28,500
where's the skill?

2481
06:17:28,500 --> 06:17:46,479
turbulence, right here

2482
06:17:46,479 --> 06:17:48,479
I guess you can follow up the slash with a powerful downward strike

2483
06:17:48,479 --> 06:17:53,020
I'll get it

2484
06:17:53,020 --> 06:17:55,020
who is another one?

2485
06:17:55,020 --> 06:17:57,020
down burst

2486
06:17:57,020 --> 06:18:06,500
why why?

2487
06:18:06,500 --> 06:18:10,779
I may have run out of

2488
06:18:10,779 --> 06:18:14,430
points here

2489
06:18:14,430 --> 06:18:18,720
yeah

2490
06:18:18,720 --> 06:18:20,720
you can charge the second hit as well, that's pretty cool

2491
06:18:20,720 --> 06:18:25,779
I don't have enough for the mariachi

2492
06:18:25,779 --> 06:18:50,990
the devil

2493
06:18:50,990 --> 06:18:52,990
everything okay on your side?

2494
06:18:52,990 --> 06:18:54,990
I am out of colorado airspace

2495
06:18:54,990 --> 06:18:56,990
and nothing on the radar

2496
06:18:56,990 --> 06:18:58,990
that guy's face seriously looks like the scream mask

2497
06:18:58,990 --> 06:19:00,990
I'm almost there

2498
06:19:00,990 --> 06:19:05,729
does he get a full letagrade?

2499
06:19:05,729 --> 06:19:23,580
do I get to ride the motorcycle?

2500
06:19:25,580 --> 06:19:28,459
woof woof

2501
06:19:28,459 --> 06:19:38,380
so like the dogs lose

2502
06:19:38,380 --> 06:19:40,380
right

2503
06:19:40,380 --> 06:19:42,380
having a little heart to heart

2504
06:19:42,380 --> 06:19:44,380
I just analyzed his words and actions

2505
06:19:44,380 --> 06:19:46,380
I am unable to ascertain

2506
06:19:46,380 --> 06:19:48,380
his motivation

2507
06:19:50,380 --> 06:19:53,259
fancy meeting you here

2508
06:19:53,259 --> 06:19:55,259
you knew I'd come

2509
06:19:55,259 --> 06:19:58,020
I suppose I should thank you for not killing

2510
06:19:58,020 --> 06:20:00,020
everyone at the launch site

2511
06:20:00,020 --> 06:20:03,470
hehehehe

2512
06:20:03,470 --> 06:20:05,470
well not if you say it like that

2513
06:20:05,470 --> 06:20:07,470
I just want a mack truck to drive down the road

2514
06:20:07,470 --> 06:20:09,970
you're not very good at your job

2515
06:20:09,970 --> 06:20:12,270
the war

2516
06:20:12,270 --> 06:20:16,049
is the big payoff

2517
06:20:16,049 --> 06:20:18,049
big raises all around

2518
06:20:18,049 --> 06:20:20,049
once world marshal gets all those contracts

2519
06:20:20,049 --> 06:20:22,349
I'm not

2520
06:20:22,349 --> 06:20:24,349
talking about money jack

2521
06:20:24,349 --> 06:20:27,619
I'm talking ideals

2522
06:20:27,619 --> 06:20:29,619
excuse me

2523
06:20:29,619 --> 06:20:32,819
forget it

2524
06:20:32,819 --> 06:20:34,819
we've both heard enough speeches about higher causes

2525
06:20:34,819 --> 06:20:37,759
by now

2526
06:20:37,759 --> 06:20:39,759
history will decide who's right

2527
06:20:42,000 --> 06:20:44,560
end of story

2528
06:20:44,560 --> 06:20:48,720
van van van van

2529
06:20:48,720 --> 06:20:50,720

06:20:50,720 --> 06:20:52,720
he just starts doing that with his mouth

2531
06:20:52,720 --> 06:21:06,720
is the dog the referee?

2532
06:21:06,720 --> 06:21:09,790
I don't care who thinks I'm right

2533
06:21:09,790 --> 06:21:11,790
I've got cause enough for killing you

2534
06:21:11,790 --> 06:21:13,790

2535
06:21:13,790 --> 06:21:15,790

streamer to defeat Sam I highly doubt that any cyborg enhancements was this

2592
06:31:31,389 --> 06:31:41,150
necessary evidence inconclusive I guess even a eyes don't know everything it is

2593
06:31:41,150 --> 06:31:48,470
likely no single correct answer exists additionally human conflict stems from

2594
06:31:48,470 --> 06:31:54,549
opposing ideals and societal norms I was not programmed with these

2595

2639
06:42:52,799 --> 06:43:28,659
of brainpower no why why do you say that it's taking over the whole internet

2640
06:43:28,659 --> 06:43:39,549
doesn't matter well shit from fucking ten years ago doesn't matter nothing you

2641
06:43:39,549 --> 06:43:46,319
sure we got the right only base big enough with security contracted out to

2642
06:43:46,880 --> 06:43:59,110
all right I'm headed in goodness gracious put the mariachi nice to play that it's

2643
06:43:59,110 --> 06:44:40,250
too late to put that on fine what a great end of the video game level and

2644
06:44:40,250 --> 06:45:00,759
cutscene wait to see what the thumbnail for this video is gonna be eliminate

2645
06:45:00,759 --> 06:45:25,869
all enemies a Lolli Lolli lemonade all enemies

2646
06:45:33,310 --> 06:45:56,419
holy shit he just gave up after buying the mariachi that's not true

2647
06:45:56,419 --> 06:46:14,590
it is I believe I have all I need for a little surprise

2648
06:46:14,590 --> 06:46:31,459
they used to like healthy room one hit you see that yeah their exit codes show

2649
06:46:31,459 --> 06:46:36,459
up as unaffiliated wait Marshall has the security contract for the space why

2650
06:46:36,459 --> 06:46:39,540
would they have their side work set to the same illegal exit code as

2651
06:46:39,540 --> 06:46:45,060
Desperado it's evidence against them no it's their alibi they're making it

2652
06:46:45,060 --> 06:46:48,900
look like Desperado hacked their soldiers on site because everyone knows

2653
06:46:48,900 --> 06:46:57,139
Desperado has a contract with the Pakistani rebels I'm too tired to mute

2654
06:46:57,139 --> 06:47:01,220
the game audio and voice act up this nice big foreign threat all cooked up

2655
06:47:01,220 --> 06:47:04,939
and ready to serve the media and the public won't be able to resist

2656
06:47:04,939 --> 06:47:09,459
remember WMDs in Iraq we're at the end of the game no I'm not gonna do

2657
06:47:09,500 --> 06:47:15,619
that what about any humans on the base Marshal only handled security dead most

2658
06:47:15,619 --> 06:47:20,860
likely or brain-jacked if they needed them to keep up appearances they'd

2659
06:47:20,860 --> 06:47:23,819
never publicize what airport the president was flying into not in this

2660
06:47:23,819 --> 06:47:28,259
region and almost no one would have access to an outside line for security

2661
06:47:28,259 --> 06:47:32,139
reasons it wouldn't be difficult to keep things hush hush at least

2662
06:47:33,139 --> 06:47:38,319
I'm heading for the control tower if I can destroy the antenna array the US

2663
06:47:38,319 --> 06:47:44,900
military will know something's wrong good idea be careful just blue the winds

2664
06:47:44,900 --> 06:47:51,520
of destruction away fly backwards

2665
06:47:51,520 --> 06:48:19,430
didn't break it today but I'm sure I do not isn't that funny that nice again

2666
06:48:19,430 --> 06:48:25,400
these idiots with the rocket launchers where are you even aiming that why he

2667
06:48:25,400 --> 06:48:32,840
predicted where I was going to go nice really okay I'm just I can't

2668
06:48:32,840 --> 06:48:42,659
believe it I'm shocked at a point where it's I'm just could you stop doing this

2669
06:48:42,659 --> 06:49:19,599
maybe predict that I might just restart this instead of a shoot of rocket

2670
06:49:19,599 --> 06:49:29,360
proud now I gotta restart the run yeah just turn the whole game I gotta

2671
06:49:29,360 --> 06:49:48,369
restart the whole game that runs over here guys I'm sorry much unnecessary I'm

2672
06:49:48,490 --> 06:50:00,500
like making shitty noises he's just like a floating piece of hamburger meat it's

2673
06:50:00,500 --> 06:50:30,860
hard to hit I need health seriously I have no healing seriously what am I

2674
06:50:30,860 --> 06:50:36,029
supposed to do what am I supposed to do I don't know man like it seems like

2675
06:50:36,029 --> 06:50:44,720
it's not like is it impossible I don't know what to do the game actually

2676
06:50:44,720 --> 06:51:18,560
like this I can't understand how did I miss that many times because when I

2677
06:51:18,560 --> 06:51:21,400
would go down and swing it would correct up a little then correct down

2678
06:51:21,400 --> 06:51:54,540
you saw what was happening clip it and watch it another guy with a rocket

2679
06:51:54,540 --> 06:52:34,750
launcher point like making me angry not block a bolt perfect I'm like

2680
06:52:34,750 --> 06:52:42,849
underneath a submarine I get away from the submarine didn't walk that one

2681
06:52:42,849 --> 06:53:18,909
saw the arm get it I need this some way I see some water that's all I

2682
06:53:18,909 --> 06:53:25,880
need to get some water in me I'll be back to it but I gotta hold on

2683
06:53:25,919 --> 06:53:31,139
there's got to be a health potion in here somewhere and I know I called it a

2684
06:53:31,139 --> 06:53:35,259
health potion but it doesn't matter it just the thing that refills your health

2685
06:53:35,259 --> 06:54:00,700
got one there get up that where is this thing there whoo okay if I could

2686
06:54:00,700 --> 06:54:19,509
get that endurance book my mouth is just wide open right there good do a

2687
06:54:19,509 --> 06:54:23,189
fortnight dance after I win the game absolutely sure which one you want I

2688
06:54:23,189 --> 06:54:46,700
mean there's like 200 of them so nothing else I have one healing whatever

2689
06:54:46,700 --> 06:54:54,529

2690
06:54:56,729 --> 06:55:17,520
what all right all right I need something I want I want you to see

2691
06:55:17,520 --> 06:55:23,479
that because do you see it went right through the middle do it that

2692
06:55:23,479 --> 06:55:45,799
actually went right through the middle it did these backstab ones well

2693
06:55:45,799 --> 06:56:19,939
I'm not like mattering me I'm just it's it's a game that requires a lot

2694
06:56:19,939 --> 06:56:26,139
brain power and sometimes it's hard and and that's okay because it's a fun

2695
06:56:26,180 --> 06:56:29,139
game and I'm really enjoying it I think it's I think this is a swell video game

2696
06:56:29,139 --> 06:56:34,840
how much is this game oh fuck no for real actually no no joking around this

2697
06:56:34,840 --> 06:56:38,560
actually is like four dollars or something isn't it right now it's not

2698
06:56:38,560 --> 06:56:41,419

ends in three minutes really

2702
06:57:50,200 --> 06:57:54,520
there's nobody even talking on the screen it's just rocks and explosions I

2703
06:57:54,520 --> 06:58:34,880
can talk during this little tiny guy is gonna get out

2704
06:58:41,159 --> 06:58:50,639
as usual I'm strong impressive little toy you've got there but your plan ends

2705
06:58:50,639 --> 06:58:52,639
here

2706
06:58:53,959 --> 06:59:01,419
idiot you're not ending our plan you're expanding it check the internet

2707
06:59:01,419 --> 06:59:09,849
lately right check the air force one is turning back to the state what how

2708
06:59:09,849 --> 06:59:13,610
they know someone posted photos of what's happening on the base the

2709
06:59:13,610 --> 06:59:17,729
whole world is up in arms show

2710
06:59:20,430 --> 06:59:33,619
no those tabs the story leaked early then Marshall's plan is ruined the hell

2711
06:59:33,619 --> 06:59:39,020
it is look what they're saying the story just went live and already they're

2712
06:59:39,020 --> 06:59:52,400
calling for blood but the president was saved and yet American blood was

2713
06:59:53,400 --> 06:59:59,279
by Americans he's hot a few dozen soldiers is tragic but nothing to start

2714
06:59:59,279 --> 07:00:06,040
a major war over that's just a spark son the excuse we've been waiting for

2715
07:00:06,040 --> 07:00:11,880
America's wanted this war for years the Patriots they knew war was good

2716
07:00:11,880 --> 07:00:17,000
for the economy four years later their legacy lingers on the memes they

2717
07:00:17,599 --> 07:00:24,040
left us their great is a shot nationalism unilateralism materialism

2718
07:00:24,040 --> 07:00:28,880
welcome maxims for those with no faith without guiding principles of

2719
07:00:28,880 --> 07:00:34,200
their own give yourself up to the whole no need to better yourself you're

2720
07:00:34,200 --> 07:00:40,200
American your number one then the only value left is dollar value the

2721
07:00:40,200 --> 07:00:45,759
economy so we'll do whatever it takes to keep it humming along even war

2722
07:00:46,080 --> 07:00:51,959
especially war bullshit the Patriots planted the seed we don't need them

2723
07:00:51,959 --> 07:00:57,439
around to filter and foster their memes any longer we're spreading them just

2724
07:00:57,439 --> 07:01:03,529
find ourselves every American man woman and child

2725
07:01:05,169 --> 07:01:11,159
I'm surprised that's something to jumpstart the economy out of this

2726
07:01:11,720 --> 07:01:19,840
this recession has been stuck in since the fall of SOP and the military costs

2727
07:01:19,840 --> 07:01:24,159
wasting billions is going to help the economy

2728
07:01:24,159 --> 07:01:32,150
emcees arms manufacturers job creators Jack all those workers I just imagine

2729
07:01:32,189 --> 07:01:39,159
Kojima sitting there you know

2730
07:01:47,659 --> 07:01:58,650
wait Kojima didn't make this she had to watch this

2731
07:01:58,689 --> 07:02:17,479
what any eyewitness reports complicating the message he's surrounding himself

2732
07:02:17,479 --> 07:02:52,630
with means I understand metal gear can't follow let's go stop metal gear and

2733
07:02:52,630 --> 07:03:00,360

2784
07:21:01,520 --> 07:21:04,520
wipe the slate clean

2785
07:21:09,799 --> 07:21:13,840
why are we emote only

2786
07:21:14,400 --> 07:21:22,560

2788
07:21:27,040 --> 07:21:37,040

2789
07:21:37,040 --> 07:21:43,560
business to get elected so I can end

2790
07:21:46,020 --> 07:22:00,439
in mine people will die and kill not for money not for oil not for what

2791
07:22:00,439 --> 07:22:06,560
they're told is right every man will be free to fight his own wars

2792
07:22:06,560 --> 07:22:47,020
mr. really liked this game well I don't write my own speeches should try

2793
07:22:47,020 --> 07:22:51,340
fighting for what you believe in sometime Jack it's a Reagan club or a

2794
07:22:51,340 --> 07:23:05,040
nation or for anyone else maybe I was wrong about you am I finally

2795
07:23:05,040 --> 07:23:20,200
getting through with this world of pointless wars dusting them off

2796
07:23:20,720 --> 07:23:55,669
yeah come on you're not greedy what is going on just baiting it out that's the

2797
07:23:55,669 --> 07:24:00,340
worst way you could possibly get up and look behind you

2798
07:24:00,340 --> 07:24:06,439
can't fret over every day not when you're purging right what do you know

2799
07:24:06,439 --> 07:24:12,720
about weak you weren't born poor you've never been hungry

2800
07:24:12,720 --> 07:24:18,400
fight and steal and kill justice survive but you did survive

2801
07:24:18,400 --> 07:24:23,000
sheer force of will following your own set of rules with your own two

2802
07:24:23,000 --> 07:24:30,959
hands you took back your life and now take yours the real boss fight no

2803
07:24:30,959 --> 07:24:42,200
weapons just this fight right apparently I guess I don't know I just

2804
07:24:42,200 --> 07:24:54,490
killed the whole moment that killed the whole entire moment how would you

2805
07:24:54,490 --> 07:25:03,549
yeah I was doing cartwheels that cutscene was so long I forgot how to

2806
07:25:03,549 --> 07:26:25,529
play the game 0.1 at spoke out here that one I'm gonna I'm gonna stop is

2807
07:26:25,569 --> 07:26:30,430
there more of this shit I can't handle this anymore

2808
07:26:30,430 --> 07:26:44,639
nanomachines son they harmed in response to physical trauma can't hurt

2809
07:26:44,639 --> 07:26:56,840
me Jack just say glasses aren't made of nanomachines how they still find

2810
07:26:56,840 --> 07:27:02,240
this should be broken but off your head what an oversight by the deaf

2811
07:27:02,799 --> 07:27:36,540
very mean

2812
07:27:45,540 --> 07:28:05,150
all right I think we're about done here right

2813
07:28:11,909 --> 07:28:17,720
working towards this and on the last day Lonnie has me doubting the whole

2814
07:28:17,720 --> 07:28:24,909
thing we'll leave it up to fate then shall we will see a duel to the death

2815
07:28:25,509 --> 07:28:34,840
the best man win Sam I cut him down and that's that back to a regularly

2816
07:28:34,840 --> 07:28:43,729
scheduled international now I can hurt him but if he beeps me if I die here

2817
07:28:43,729 --> 07:28:48,080
the lock on my blade will disable after a couple hours

2818
07:28:48,080 --> 07:28:51,599
can you what happens after that is up to you

2819
07:28:52,599 --> 07:29:00,000
huh even dead that guy's a pain in my ass and this is stupid I'm too cool

2820
07:29:00,240 --> 07:29:10,319
you think that little sword can save your master well go ahead then but

2821
07:29:10,319 --> 07:29:16,279
make no mistake fight oh sometimes I look over you guys say the funniest

2822
07:29:16,479 --> 07:29:19,479
rim shipment

2823
07:29:20,200 --> 07:29:28,560
I was not designed to fear termination however directives world one is to

2824
07:29:28,560 --> 07:29:35,639
ensure all data acquired is preserved and pass along to expire here would

2825
07:29:35,639 --> 07:29:41,520
violate that directive that's a good boy

2826
07:29:41,720 --> 07:29:49,520
however right came to my aid I have learned from him when Samuel fell data

2827
07:29:49,520 --> 07:29:56,080
analysis was inconclusive but that has changed I have established new

2828
07:29:56,080 --> 07:30:02,680
parameters now created my only directives like a 30-minute ending

2829
07:30:02,680 --> 07:30:05,360
sequence here

2830
07:30:21,430 --> 07:30:35,279
now for the real fight right I said my sword was a tool of justice I used an

2831
07:30:35,279 --> 07:30:48,500
anger not used for vengeance but my favorite flavor strawberry and besides

2832
07:30:49,060 --> 07:30:58,590

2833
07:31:13,799 --> 07:31:31,299

2834
07:31:31,299 --> 07:31:34,669

07:51:42,819 --> 07:51:45,740
I've got I don't know what which one is which but I'm gonna crash the

2936
07:51:45,740 --> 07:52:14,869
game okay so I'm just gonna say this is one is it hairline turn off the

2937
07:52:14,869 --> 07:52:39,799
hairline worst hair this is this looks good that's the baby little kid

2938
07:52:39,799 --> 07:52:51,939

2939
07:52:51,939 --> 07:53:20,720
acknowledge the DLC okay how much does the DLC add thank you that's a

2940
07:53:20,720 --> 07:53:32,419
couple hours two stories and about Sam that's cool it's great so three

2941
07:53:32,419 --> 07:53:42,009
hours super fun all story related all right yeah that's kind of a weird

2942
07:53:42,009 --> 07:53:46,400
like that's gonna have to be a scenario where because if it's like a

2943
07:53:46,439 --> 07:53:50,720
three-hour experience that's that's not enough to do for a whole stream so that

2944
07:53:50,720 --> 07:53:53,360
have to be a day where there's something to do for two or three hours

2945
07:53:53,360 --> 07:53:58,680
and then that we kind of need two three to four hour experiences back to

2946
07:53:58,680 --> 07:54:05,319
back you know I mean I keep saying it you know you know me New Year's

2949
07:54:22,360 --> 07:54:28,380
lot of money not to mention killing their funding literally the

2950
07:54:28,380 --> 07:54:33,540
breathtaking program is finished but the larger company is not I'm afraid

2951
07:54:33,540 --> 07:54:39,540
that someone will buy them PMC's are in demand once again

2952
07:54:39,540 --> 07:54:50,790

3061
08:10:08,290 --> 08:10:11,490
wasn't able to watch the stream live but I watched the VOD last night it

3062
08:10:11,490 --> 08:10:14,770
was a great stream but when I went to bed I had a horrific nightmare when my

3063
08:10:14,770 --> 08:10:19,490
hair was replaced with your hair it was very messy and I couldn't get it

3064
08:10:19,490 --> 08:10:21,970
to look good so I locked myself in the bathroom and freaked out while

3065
08:10:21,970 --> 08:10:26,169
everyone outside was confused this is not a joke this was the actual dream

3066
08:10:26,169 --> 08:10:32,029
your hair gave me a nightmare looks good though on you all right you can't

3067
08:10:32,029 --> 08:10:38,270
first of all you can't say your hair gave me a nightmare and then say but it

looks good on you that's contradicting statements but thank you

3069

Bosmer for the ten bucks sorry about your dream mostly lost thanks for the

3070
08:10:53,360 --> 08:10:56,119
one dollar local streamer isn't sure if there is stealth in a Metal

3071
08:10:56,119 --> 08:11:00,880
Gear game but there is no there is here's how you tell if there's

3072
08:11:00,880 --> 08:11:05,560
stealth in a video game there was no stealth in that game I'm sorry there

3073
08:11:05,560 --> 08:11:11,220
wasn't where was the crouch button if a game has stealth it has a crouch or a

3074
08:11:11,220 --> 08:11:21,049
duck and walk slow button there was no stealth in that game there was walk

3075
08:11:21,049 --> 08:11:30,150
that's not stealth it's called using the box no no no no no no I'm sorry

3076
08:11:30,150 --> 08:11:40,950
that doesn't count the box does not count as a crouch how doesn't that

3077
08:11:40,950 --> 08:11:50,900
count because that's you're putting yourself into a box there is no push

3078
08:11:50,900 --> 08:11:56,919
in l3 and you go down and you're creeping around it's an item that's an

3079
08:11:56,919 --> 08:12:01,020
emote that's an emote dance from fortnight is what that was in this

3080
08:12:01,020 --> 08:12:13,040
game that's how it wasn't the other Metal Gears no wasn't and the other

3081
08:12:13,040 --> 08:12:19,709
Middle Gears you could go up against the wall and go well where was my

3082
08:12:19,709 --> 08:12:52,939
whistle where's my knock you crouch down in the box did you pay it hey

3105
08:15:13,810 --> 08:15:20,740
surprised they did not do anything else with the game I mean I guess the two

3106
08:15:20,740 --> 08:15:29,860
DLCs it just is it a really a scenario where Konami just doesn't get

3107
08:15:29,860 --> 08:15:45,709
it and it just makes slot machines you guys know that right yeah yes we

3108
08:15:45,709 --> 08:15:56,099
know it sucks they have a lot of great franchises the developer of the

3109
08:15:56,099 --> 08:16:04,619
game said they'd love to make a second and Konami said no weird but thank you

3117
08:16:42,380 --> 08:16:47,959
stranger on the internet money it means a fucking shitload to me don't

3118
08:16:47,959 --> 08:16:52,709
worry about that and I used the word stranger I mean I mean that like

3119
08:16:52,709 --> 08:17:06,130
physically you know I mean because obviously a lot of you guys have been

3120
08:17:06,130 --> 08:17:11,560
around for a long time but I mean that in a literal physical way you're

3121
08:17:11,560 --> 08:17:16,380
giving somebody money and you're hanging out here and we have a good time

3122
08:17:16,380 --> 08:17:22,139

3128
08:18:11,040 --> 08:18:20,529

3166
08:23:43,080 --> 08:23:51,490
Halloween that mask was not five dollars at a few zeros no that means

3167
08:23:51,490 --> 08:24:02,669
it's five thousand that mask was not five thousand dollars that mask was five

3168
08:24:02,669 --> 08:24:11,090
grand okay gonna get my money's worth out of that character hey thanks

3169
08:24:11,090 --> 08:24:15,830
peaceful Haley for the one dollar hey Jeremy just wanted to know how you

3170
08:24:15,830 --> 08:24:18,310
were doing and also just wanted to let you know how amazing your

3171
08:24:18,310 --> 08:24:22,669
community is and the friends I've made a here on discord on here and on

3172
08:24:22,669 --> 08:24:26,909
discord and the people who come over and watch my stream feels good when I

3173
08:24:26,909 --> 08:24:30,029
can entertain others and that's all thanks to you or else I wouldn't have

3174
08:24:30,029 --> 08:24:33,310
known what to do with myself so thank you Jeremy you're awesome

3175
08:24:33,310 --> 08:24:43,349
yeah I fought for a long time to even have that discord because I wasn't sure

3176
08:24:43,349 --> 08:24:46,430
if it was something I wanted to do do I want to have a discord but

3177
08:24:46,430 --> 08:24:50,069
people do discords I do think the paid discord no no why would I do

3178
08:24:50,069 --> 08:24:54,470
that like sub rooms channel how do I even manage this like I didn't know if

3179
08:24:54,470 --> 08:25:00,159
it was something I was gonna do because that it's hard to do that it's

3180
08:25:00,159 --> 08:25:02,799
hard I mean as much as it's easy to be like I have a discord and go

3181
08:25:02,799 --> 08:25:07,770
there and but I whatever managing something like that with thousands of

3182
08:25:07,770 --> 08:25:13,709
people is actually hard to do so you can thank the mods for being around all

3183
08:25:13,709 --> 08:25:18,150
the time to take care of that and to make it so much easier to have that

3184
08:25:18,150 --> 08:25:24,330
because I'll be very frank with you if the mods in this community were not

3185
08:25:24,330 --> 08:25:29,939
on top of their game every day that discord does not exist I wouldn't be

3186
08:25:29,939 --> 08:25:35,259
able to have it I've tried before to have communities I've had groups

3187
08:25:35,259 --> 08:25:38,979
I've had oh I'm just gonna set up this thing and maybe I can like a steam

3188
08:25:38,979 --> 08:25:53,770
group and shit and I never can manage it so without them there is no discord

3189
08:25:53,770 --> 08:25:58,720
and I'm really glad that it can exist because messages like this proved

3190
08:25:58,720 --> 08:26:09,750
that it's worth having for sure no right music's not playing but thank

3191
08:26:09,750 --> 08:26:21,950
you peaceful Haley appreciate it uh yakko boo thank you for the $1 no

3192
08:26:21,950 --> 08:26:26,970
message thank you thank you yakko Alec thanks for the two bucks so when

3193
08:26:26,970 --> 08:26:30,849
are you gonna play ocarina of time I'm probably not gonna play ocarina of time

3194
08:26:30,849 --> 08:26:40,630
on stream probably not if I was to do a Zelda game on stream it would probably

3195
08:26:40,630 --> 08:26:51,099
be breath of the wild but even that's kind of a long shot at this point so

3196
08:26:51,099 --> 08:26:54,880
if I was to play a Zelda game that would be the one that would be played

3197
08:26:54,880 --> 08:27:04,180
but why oh cuz it's a pretty huge time commitment I played a lot of red

3198
08:27:04,180 --> 08:27:10,060
dead and I streamed a lot of red dead and isn't breath of the wild a

3199
08:27:10,259 --> 08:27:21,130
huge game this stream this community I feel like and I'm like this too I don't

3200
08:27:21,130 --> 08:27:24,610
really like to have oh yeah breath of the wild breath of the wild breath of

3201
08:27:24,610 --> 08:27:28,860
the wild because when I get into a game I want to play it but I don't

3202
08:27:28,860 --> 08:27:34,169
really like streaming a game more than four or five six times in a row

3203
08:27:34,169 --> 08:27:38,919
and then if I leave it I'll come back to it there's all this shit

3204
08:27:38,919 --> 08:27:43,240
that's going on more ideas and more games and I never usually go back to

3205
08:27:43,240 --> 08:27:53,419
it yeah I would say play breath of the

3206
08:27:53,419 --> 08:27:57,400
wild on your own maybe stream it once or twice that's typically how it goes yeah

3207
08:27:57,400 --> 08:28:02,319
I'll play a game that's like breath of the wild like a red dead like there's a

3208
08:28:02,319 --> 08:28:07,389
lot of other ones that have been in that similar realm play it on stream

3209
08:28:07,389 --> 08:28:11,630
few times maybe three or four times and then all right that was cool I'm

3210
08:28:11,630 --> 08:28:23,069
gonna finish it on my own so that's definitely possible please go back to

3211
08:28:23,069 --> 08:28:29,099
red dead though I beat the game off-stream I completed red dead

3212
08:28:29,099 --> 08:28:45,259
redemption 2 off-stream betrayal it was great did you finish everything I

3213
08:28:45,259 --> 08:28:55,470
finished everything everything I love rockstar games so I did all the story

3214
08:28:55,470 --> 08:28:59,389
and it did all the side stuff I didn't do all the hunting stuff though

3215
08:28:59,389 --> 08:29:05,810
but I did I think pretty much all the dialogue content that's in the game

3216
08:29:05,810 --> 08:29:14,669
to be honest I'm glad you enjoyed it definitely worth keeping some games

3217
08:29:15,549 --> 08:29:22,060
yeah I mean this this could bleed into a conversation about the game that you

3218
08:29:22,060 --> 08:29:27,849
saw tonight it's a different when I play a game

3219
08:29:27,849 --> 08:29:31,490
off-stream it's a lot different you know I'm just kind of sitting there

3220
08:29:31,490 --> 08:29:37,330
and I'm not really talking I'm just enjoying the game and having fun I'm

3221
08:29:37,330 --> 08:29:41,630
not really speaking or anything and it could actually have I have some

3222
08:29:41,630 --> 08:29:44,590
trouble especially the games that require a lot of attention and this

3223
08:29:44,590 --> 08:29:51,979
is because of my uncontrollable ADHD looking at chat and talking and let's

3224
08:29:51,979 --> 08:29:54,580
talk about this thing and this thing and it's it's kind of it's I like

3225
08:29:54,580 --> 08:30:00,259
having you know the off-stream sit there with my mouth open type of

3226
08:30:00,259 --> 08:30:05,779
type of experience and yeah you can't really do that on stream I can't

3227
08:30:05,779 --> 08:30:17,700
really sit here and just like this for like 40 straight minutes that's

3228
08:30:17,700 --> 08:30:24,119
another five community subs from soft 33 thank you soft for the five

3229
08:30:24,880 --> 08:30:32,389
surprised and glad you have time to play games on your own and with how much you

3230
08:30:32,389 --> 08:30:39,599
put into your streams yeah but remember I want I want this I want each stream

3231
08:30:39,599 --> 08:30:46,619
that I do to engage and talk and hang hang out and interact with you guys

3232
08:30:46,619 --> 08:30:52,000
and sometimes it is nice just to turn off my brain and just not just sit

3233
08:30:52,000 --> 08:30:59,919
there and I'll play a game like Red Dead for like six straight hours it's

3234
08:30:59,919 --> 08:31:11,799
just eating fucking chocolate you know I mean but yeah it is but but there's

3235
08:31:11,799 --> 08:31:14,479
another thing though this is why it's it's kind of a double-edged sword

3236
08:31:14,479 --> 08:31:18,919
because if in games a lot of times I'll be playing a game just alone in the

3237
08:31:18,919 --> 08:31:22,200
dark with the headphones on or something and all of a sudden something

3238
08:31:22,200 --> 08:31:26,279
fucking hysterical happens or something awesome happens and I'm

3239
08:31:26,279 --> 08:31:30,889
looking around just like where did you see anybody see that I nobody's in

3240
08:31:30,889 --> 08:31:35,849
the room oh so I was awesome I should have been streaming this what

3241
08:31:35,849 --> 08:31:48,819
you know what I mean it happens a lot I think there's a balance somewhere

3242
08:31:48,819 --> 08:32:01,759
Bixby start game record how many Jax moments happen in private I mean I

3243
08:32:01,759 --> 08:32:04,560
could tell you how many I could say oh it happens all the time you're not

3244
08:32:04,560 --> 08:32:08,200
gonna believe me you know oh yeah you know you should have seen when I

3245
08:32:08,200 --> 08:32:12,720
was playing off stream I didn't saw I did all this cool shit it's like

3246
08:32:12,720 --> 08:32:31,759
okay sure you did but it's all good it's all good but thank you thank

3247
08:32:31,759 --> 08:32:35,599
you Ike turtle for the one dollar a towel I rubbed German nose wipe here's

3248
08:32:35,599 --> 08:32:49,669
a sewer dollar what's a sewer dollar thank you as a right reaction for the

3249
08:32:49,669 --> 08:32:53,630
one dollar chat maybe if you guys stopped spamming 40 things for him to

3250
08:32:53,630 --> 08:32:57,310
do he would actually be able to notice a single thing in the game and maybe

3251
08:32:57,310 --> 08:33:00,549
if you stopped spamming shit then it would actually be a surprise to him

3252
08:33:00,549 --> 08:33:27,380
instead of spoiling it 20 minutes in advance 20 minutes in advance thank

3253
08:33:27,380 --> 08:33:34,959
you as a right reaction it's alright though I mean like yes sometimes I do

3254
08:33:34,959 --> 08:33:39,020
look over it and I see three four different things before what you're

3255
08:33:39,020 --> 08:33:41,500
doing you need to do that you got to do this you have to do this what you

3256
08:33:41,500 --> 08:33:44,619
doing why go that way go the other way that weapon sucks and it's just

3257
08:33:44,619 --> 08:34:00,159
like I don't know what oh but that's just that's just what happens though

3258
08:34:00,159 --> 08:34:14,069
it's it you know it back seating nice not even no it's all right Ken

3259
08:34:14,069 --> 08:34:18,150
and like I get it like I'm not doing something right or if I'm fucking up and

3260
08:34:18,150 --> 08:34:21,509
do something wrong and I'm not learning it yeah probably is frustrating to watch

3261
08:34:21,509 --> 08:34:25,669
but it's also frustrating for me too because I want I want to figure it out

3262
08:34:25,669 --> 08:34:30,779
and I want but I don't want to have to figure it out where it's a

3263
08:34:30,779 --> 08:34:35,639
detriment to the stream you know if I spend 50 minutes trying to figure out

3264
08:34:35,639 --> 08:34:39,159
how to block somebody it's like fucking Jesus Jeremy give me a break

3265
08:34:39,720 --> 08:34:59,830
but the game the gnome porn links got old spoilers or shit though really hope

3266
08:34:59,830 --> 08:35:04,319
people can avoid that stuff I didn't really care I mean the one the only

3267
08:35:04,319 --> 08:35:09,959
thing that I kind of was just like oh okay was when everyone was screaming

3268
08:35:09,959 --> 08:35:18,069
about the cat so I mean that's the real that's the only spoiler I really

3269
08:35:18,069 --> 08:35:21,310
think I received during the stream maybe a couple other things too but I

3270
08:35:21,310 --> 08:35:27,779
don't know it at the end of the day it's just people are just trying to

3271
08:35:27,779 --> 08:35:51,159
have fun ruined that cutscene about memes yeah but it's alright I was not

3272
08:35:51,159 --> 08:35:56,680
I've that was not making me frustrated what was making me frustrated was the

3273
08:35:56,680 --> 08:36:01,590
game you know it's a tough game I don't think it was anything in chat

3274
08:36:01,590 --> 08:36:08,310
that I was like shut up everybody I think it was one time maybe where when

3275
08:36:08,310 --> 08:36:10,709
I was telling what I was told to go in four or five different directions

3276
08:36:10,709 --> 08:36:21,680
you're too forgiving you need to punish your chat more but but but

3277
08:36:21,680 --> 08:36:27,979
punish for what you know if I start punishing for stuff like you suck at the

3278
08:36:27,979 --> 08:36:32,860
game or hey you went the wrong way or spoilers I mean a lot of people would

3279
08:36:32,860 --> 08:36:41,610
be on that list too before am I gonna ban them if I ban somebody every time

3280
08:36:41,610 --> 08:36:48,689
somebody told me that you're doing it wrong I think I think half the chat

3281
08:36:48,689 --> 08:37:10,400
wouldn't exist if you nobody there the mods would even get banned that's

3282
08:37:10,400 --> 08:37:18,840
how you know when it's unnecessarily rude it can be kind of depressing yeah I

3283
08:37:18,840 --> 08:37:22,000
mean I'm not gonna lie I'll be completely open here sometimes I look

3284
08:37:22,000 --> 08:37:28,669
over and it's I read something and it's just like fuck that person's is

3285
08:37:28,669 --> 08:37:32,150
really fucking mad at me right now and somebody's saying something fucking

3286
08:37:32,150 --> 08:37:36,340
mean and shit it's just like god I wish I could I really I don't want you

3287
08:37:36,340 --> 08:37:48,580
to be saying that that doesn't happen that often though I would say

3288
08:37:48,580 --> 08:37:56,650
if I stream this 365 days in a year if I stream a hundred days a year if there's

3289
08:37:56,650 --> 08:38:02,759
like a hundred and twenty five hundred and thirty streams a year maybe like

3290
08:38:02,759 --> 08:38:07,599
three or four of those streams I will actually look over and be like kind

3291
08:38:07,599 --> 08:38:29,790
of depressed or annoyed by something doesn't happen that often and ninety

3292
08:38:29,790 --> 08:38:35,840
nine point nine percent of the time it's we're just having fun I've been

3293
08:38:35,840 --> 08:38:38,880
I know I've spent a lot of time on this topic but I think it's worth

3294
08:38:38,880 --> 08:38:46,979
talking about like somebody saying that I suck no no no because I know that

3295
08:38:46,979 --> 08:38:51,720
that's you know I do dumb shit in games all the time that's not what I'm

3296
08:38:51,720 --> 08:38:54,439
talking about I'm talking about like me something really mean that's like a

3297
08:38:54,439 --> 08:38:58,959
full-on like sentence about how something I'm doing is so stupid or

3298
08:38:58,959 --> 08:39:02,639
I'm such a piece of shit or something it's just like fucking hell

3299
08:39:02,639 --> 08:39:24,619
mr. German can you eat anybody who complains about bugleberry gets me

3300
08:39:24,619 --> 08:39:34,400
like that and it's so easy let me tell you that it's so easy it's such

3301
08:39:34,439 --> 08:39:41,619
an easy out to say well fuck the haters fucking haters fuck the haters but that

3302
08:39:41,619 --> 08:39:46,979
that's a person with an opinion and they have it for a reason you know I

3303
08:39:46,979 --> 08:39:50,340
don't I hate being that kind of person that's just like a fuck the

3304
08:39:50,340 --> 08:40:03,580
haters cares yeah fucking hater no I that person has an opinion and what

3305
08:40:03,580 --> 08:40:20,049
am I gonna do yeah but their opinion is wrong no if somebody comes

3306
08:40:20,049 --> 08:40:23,590
in here and doesn't like what I'm doing then that's I'm not gonna be mad at

3307
08:40:23,590 --> 08:40:31,740
that person because they don't like what I'm doing that's it they'll move on

3308
08:40:31,740 --> 08:40:34,340
and that's it I'm not gonna be like oh you didn't like what you see here

3309
08:40:34,340 --> 08:40:38,340
you're a fucking little baby and let me tell you that you're a little

3310
08:40:38,340 --> 08:40:44,450
baby no sorry I didn't think it was fun maybe you'll check back again

3311
08:40:44,450 --> 08:41:05,060
another time but this is a pretty long-winded comment about all this

3312
08:41:05,060 --> 08:41:27,880
it's a cool heart to heart yeah it's sometimes we do these sometimes you

3313
08:41:27,880 --> 08:41:36,310
just gotta talk it's all fun and games but you know we're all people here so

3314
08:41:36,310 --> 08:41:51,430
right after that Roger Cheeto thanks for the $1 you missed the memes stop

3315
08:41:51,430 --> 08:42:10,599
talking during cutscenes dumbass the timing the timing was impeccable but

3316
08:42:10,599 --> 08:42:22,250
thank you for the $1 mostly lost thanks for the $1 because you're

3317
08:42:22,250 --> 08:42:26,970
apparently incapable of processing two things at once here's the memes

3318
08:42:26,970 --> 08:43:03,259
cutscene thanks for the dollar mostly let the roast continue protect him no

3319
08:43:03,259 --> 08:43:06,939
that's funny that's funny I mean if I had looked over and saw that like

3320
08:43:06,939 --> 08:43:09,819
four hours ago because I was already like the game was like give I was

3321
08:43:09,819 --> 08:43:13,459
getting kind of mentally fatigued if I looked over and saw that I would

3322
08:43:13,459 --> 08:43:22,939
have been like okay fine fine no it's all good thanks for the dollar you guys

3323
08:43:22,939 --> 08:43:37,500
thank you for speaking a dollar thank you for real though for the $1 watch

3324
08:43:37,500 --> 08:43:42,090
this no this is not something that will get you in trouble I love the

3325
08:43:42,090 --> 08:43:48,840
the context has to be there

3326
08:44:21,860 --> 08:44:32,599
he's just like puking thank you it's not gonna get you in trouble that it's not

3327
08:44:32,599 --> 08:44:47,250
thank you thank you ushi corn for the $1 it's gonna be the last season of

3328
08:44:47,250 --> 08:44:52,759
Eric Andre is it really well I guess maybe he's been doing other shit

3329
08:44:52,759 --> 08:44:57,709
though he's been on other TV shows that aren't the Eric Andre show so

3330
08:44:57,709 --> 08:45:08,750
he's probably he's branching out a lot but thank you ushi corn thank

3331
08:45:08,750 --> 08:45:15,819
you thank you kill Ganon for the dollar 15 I got fired today I'm sorry but I

3332
08:45:15,819 --> 08:45:19,619
decided to use this time to pursue something more creative I just wanted to

3333
08:45:19,619 --> 08:45:22,259
ask when you started making videos that it terrified you that everyone

3334
08:45:22,259 --> 08:45:36,569
would hate what you'd made no because I wasn't making videos I wasn't making

3335
08:45:36,569 --> 08:45:45,380
videos I don't think it's this kind of hard to describe and explain but

3336
08:45:45,380 --> 08:45:50,479
I wasn't I wasn't making videos to try to get like an audience I was kind of

3337
08:45:50,479 --> 08:45:55,130
just doing them it was a way for me to pass my time and I thought they were

3338
08:45:55,130 --> 08:46:00,369
fun and I wasn't really in the back of my mind of oh somebody's gonna hate

3339
08:46:00,369 --> 08:46:10,040
this I was just kind of doing it it really didn't it took probably like

3340
08:46:10,040 --> 08:46:17,580
20 or 30 videos remember I'd had no expectations at all zero absolute zero

3341
08:46:17,580 --> 08:46:23,529
if I got 20 viewers it was like oh that whoa okay who that where they

3342
08:46:23,529 --> 08:46:36,360
from well this is cool so when your intentions are not to I guess when your

3343
08:46:36,360 --> 08:46:42,939
intentions aren't to necessarily have an audience you really don't mind or

3344
08:46:42,939 --> 08:46:46,419
don't necessarily care who comes across it because you're doing it

3345
08:46:46,419 --> 08:46:51,959
because you want to make them not necessarily to have a bunch of

3346
08:46:51,959 --> 08:46:58,959
people and watch my first 10 20 videos it's just me just talking and

3347
08:46:58,959 --> 08:47:02,880
being like fucking weird and saying like strange shit and just doing

3348
08:47:02,880 --> 08:47:25,569
nothing but now I don't think that the words not terrify but I I don't want

3349
08:47:25,569 --> 08:47:31,479
people to hate the things that I make so I try as hard as I'm able to to try

3350
08:47:31,479 --> 08:47:37,090
to do as best as I can because I in my heart and in my brain think that

3351
08:47:37,090 --> 08:47:42,490
the best that I can is hopefully good enough I think everybody thinks that

3352
08:47:42,490 --> 08:47:57,840
everybody just hopes the best that they can is good enough and there are

3353
08:47:58,680 --> 08:48:04,889
a bunch of people here now that I know already kind of get it because they've

3354
08:48:04,889 --> 08:48:12,639
been here for so long it was it's a weird it's a weird thing where made

3355
08:48:12,639 --> 08:48:18,029
videos for years didn't really have that many expectations I wasn't like

3356
08:48:18,029 --> 08:48:20,869
partnered on YouTube for a bit particularly took like a hundred and

3357
08:48:20,869 --> 08:48:24,110
fifty videos I think of more than a like at least fifty to a hundred

3358
08:48:24,110 --> 08:48:29,389
before I had any money at all from YouTube and there's a bunch of

3359
08:48:29,389 --> 08:48:32,549
people here that just a lot of people just kind of get it and they

3360
08:48:32,549 --> 08:48:38,520
think the things are fun and you guys are a part of the joke as much as you

3361
08:48:38,520 --> 08:48:56,810
know for the half the shit that is done on this stream I don't get it did

3362
08:48:56,810 --> 08:48:59,569
you lose the password to your main channel I know it's a meme but I'm

3363
08:48:59,569 --> 08:49:05,069
really curious I've talked about it a bunch of times before but YouTube just

3364
08:49:05,069 --> 08:49:12,110
wasn't it just wasn't doing it for me anymore and I mean that in a

3365
08:49:12,110 --> 08:49:15,470
bunch of different ways it creatively monetarily that's back when

3366
08:49:15,470 --> 08:49:19,200
never YouTube would changed a lot of shit there was a lot of

3367
08:49:19,200 --> 08:49:21,919
subscription shit that they were changing there was a bunch of ad

3368
08:49:21,919 --> 08:49:27,159
revenue stuff that they were getting rid of and it was it was hard to let's

3369
08:49:27,159 --> 08:49:32,909
say if I was gonna spend like a week on a video it just really wasn't

3370
08:49:32,909 --> 08:49:41,880
possible anymore so I didn't lose the password to my main YouTube

3371
08:49:41,880 --> 08:49:46,700
channel I just stopped using it because I started losing interest and

3372
08:49:46,700 --> 08:49:50,779
twitch seemed like the next thing that I wanted to try to do I don't

3373
08:49:50,779 --> 08:49:56,099
know what the next thing will be but I'm not gonna force myself to make

3374
08:49:56,099 --> 08:50:01,810
a video just because I like have to that's not gonna happen if I am not

3375
08:50:01,810 --> 08:50:06,639
wholeheartedly enjoying every everything that I'm doing it'll show

3376
08:50:06,639 --> 08:50:09,799
it'll just be forced and I don't want to force stuff I'd rather have it come

3377
08:50:09,799 --> 08:50:31,529
naturally and have fun natural raw German I've told I've told you guys

3378
08:50:31,529 --> 08:50:35,049
this you know over the last two three years on twitch if what I'm doing is

3379
08:50:35,049 --> 08:50:39,540
not something that I'm having fun doing and enjoying doing and having

3380
08:50:39,540 --> 08:50:43,340
you know more ideas are coming out because remember on YouTube there was a

3381
08:50:43,340 --> 08:50:46,259
lot of things I wanted to try and a lot of things I wanted to do and now

3382
08:50:46,259 --> 08:51:10,560
that's I have to have that same itch on twitch on itch on twitch nice rhyme you

3383
08:51:10,560 --> 08:51:12,599
ever thought about saying that on the main channel innocent people who didn't

3384
08:51:12,599 --> 08:51:18,560
even know you stream just thought you kind of disappeared yeah I think part of

3385
08:51:18,560 --> 08:51:22,590
me in my brain somewhere kind of doesn't want to make that video

3386
08:51:22,590 --> 08:51:29,959
somewhere up in my brain I don't want to tell people it's over here it's

3387
08:51:29,959 --> 08:51:33,959
on twitch and see on twitch this is a weird lock in my brain because

3388
08:51:33,959 --> 08:51:39,959
that's such a huge portion of my life it's like this this door that's still

3389
08:51:39,959 --> 08:51:46,759
up there that I I've got this I know there's a monster in that room but I

3390
08:51:46,759 --> 08:51:50,990
don't know what to do about him he's just in there I can't let him out

3391
08:51:50,990 --> 08:52:11,069
he'll eat me just tell them about the second channel yeah I've thought

3392
08:52:11,069 --> 08:52:18,880
about it but I mean that's another thing too I just don't don't pissing

3393
08:52:18,880 --> 08:52:23,470
people off and making a video on on that main channel saying hey by the

3394
08:52:23,470 --> 08:52:27,110
way I know it's been a couple of years since you last seen me but I'm done

3395
08:52:27,110 --> 08:52:32,549
isn't that like kind of you made you waited two you waited two years to make

3396
08:52:32,549 --> 08:52:39,130
a video saying that I'm done on YouTube hey guys when was the last time

3397
08:52:39,130 --> 08:52:43,490
you heard my voice hey it's a new upload from German on a five here it

3398
08:52:43,490 --> 08:53:01,099
is okay I'm done that's kind of pointless in a way I gotta go I gotta

3399
08:53:01,099 --> 08:53:12,979
get out of here but closing that door is I don't think it's even

3400
08:53:12,979 --> 08:53:19,759
necessarily necessary because I don't know a year or two from now a couple

3401
08:53:19,759 --> 08:53:22,520
of years I don't know who knows maybe I will want to go back to YouTube and

3402
08:53:22,520 --> 08:53:31,520
make more video content actual edited video car I don't know I never had a

3403
08:53:31,520 --> 08:53:38,819
plan I don't have a plan you know like I did this there's no errors the

3404
08:53:38,819 --> 08:53:50,139
plan nope I have plans week to week and month to month if I have

3405
08:53:50,139 --> 08:53:53,439
something that I'd like to do on stream or back when I was making

3406
08:53:53,439 --> 08:53:59,959
YouTube videos I got plans to do content and do things but long term of

3407
08:53:59,959 --> 08:54:03,860
where I want to be and what I want to do not really just wherever the wind

3408
08:54:03,860 --> 08:54:13,159
takes me is what's gonna happen what would you do if streaming was no longer

3409
08:54:13,159 --> 08:54:23,159
profitable um something else you know cuz you have to remember I'm 30 I'm

3410
08:54:23,159 --> 08:54:35,040
turning 34 this year so I mean I wouldn't just disappear but it's at

3411
08:54:35,040 --> 08:54:38,759
some point I gotta do if I wasn't doing streaming or YouTube or

3412
08:54:38,759 --> 08:54:50,889
something I would have to do something else I wouldn't stop streaming but it

3413
08:54:50,889 --> 08:54:54,810
wouldn't be a scenario where it was you know three four days a week or four or

3414
08:54:54,810 --> 08:54:58,610
five whatever days a week for eight nine you know this is nine hour stream

3415
08:54:58,610 --> 08:55:03,009
they'd be shorter it would be maybe once or twice a week when I had time

3416
08:55:03,009 --> 08:55:19,520
if you stop now what would you do huh that's that's a tricky one as a

3417
08:55:19,520 --> 08:55:35,340
really tricky that's a tricky question street magic um probably

3418
08:55:35,340 --> 08:55:44,009
something with the animals I'd go get like a vet tech I'd go back to school

3419
08:55:44,009 --> 08:55:54,500
probably and get a vet like tech degree or something because I I did a

3420
08:55:54,500 --> 08:56:01,209
just about a year stint at an animal shelter and it was great I would do

3421
08:56:01,209 --> 08:56:15,130
that for a job without doubt as a person who runs a rescue and as a vet

3422
08:56:15,130 --> 08:56:28,150
I prove yeah no I'd animals are awesome I would do it you going to

3423
08:56:28,150 --> 08:56:32,319
school to be vet tech right now let us know how it goes and that's probably

3424
08:56:32,319 --> 08:56:41,610
what I would be doing if I wasn't doing this I feel like that maybe I'll still

3425
08:56:41,610 --> 08:56:44,930
do it anyways and I mean I feel I'm probably one of those people that's in

3426
08:56:44,930 --> 08:56:51,139
their 50s and just decides you know what I'm just gonna go work at a zoo I

3427
08:56:51,139 --> 08:56:55,220
don't even care if I'm like the guy I'm if I'm the guy that's like

3428
08:56:55,220 --> 08:57:00,419
cleaning up after the animals and refilling water dishes and shit cool

3429
08:57:00,419 --> 08:57:21,630
that's fine with me pop pug champs did be the guy and from up and sell

3430
08:57:21,630 --> 08:57:36,270
balloons just buy just buy a farm somewhere and produce milk probably why

3431
08:57:36,270 --> 08:57:51,720
not farming is back-breaking work yeah I know I'm just throwing out random

3432
08:57:51,720 --> 08:57:58,689

3468
09:02:42,380 --> 09:02:45,659

3469
09:02:45,659 --> 09:02:49,380
they get hit by a sale metal gear series is a favorite of mine and I'd

3472
09:03:05,009 --> 09:03:08,569
pretty interesting three might be worth a stream they all might be worth the

3473
09:03:08,569 --> 09:03:23,290
stream probably not this game was a good one stream one long stream three

3474
09:03:23,290 --> 09:03:28,330

dubs can do thanks to the one dollar so glad you play this revengeance is my

3494
09:05:55,270 --> 09:05:59,590
number one favorite game that I never played the Raiden versus Armstrong

3495
09:05:59,590 --> 09:06:04,509
scene inspired me to do my first and only studio grade dub over at least in

3496
09:06:04,509 --> 09:06:07,590
my opinion so this game is pretty special to me glad you didn't get too

3497
09:06:07,590 --> 09:06:17,779
frustrated with it now go drink some brain fluid you hobbit no I did I

3498
09:06:17,779 --> 09:06:22,379
there was a I got frustrated for about 30 minutes 40 minutes maybe

3499
09:06:22,379 --> 09:06:28,190
during that stream not that much though is it a level it was a very

3500
09:06:28,190 --> 09:06:42,970
containable level thank you for that video hey Garfield the Monday killer

3501
09:06:42,970 --> 09:06:45,489
thanks for the one dollar here's Garfield coming in with some bits I

3502
09:06:45,489 --> 09:06:48,809
didn't know you were streaming German why don't you warn Garfield next time

3503
09:06:48,809 --> 09:06:53,129
you start you want Garfield to miss a stream you want to make Garfield seem

3504
09:06:53,129 --> 09:06:58,489
like he's not committed well gosh god damn it I guess it's time for

3505
09:06:58,489 --> 09:07:01,970
Garfield to make some funny garfed up jokes for you I think this just

3506
09:07:01,970 --> 09:07:05,250
broke the record for the amount of Garfield's I said in a single Gar for

3507
09:07:05,250 --> 09:07:12,750
graph anyway germ who are do you hope to see in smash DLC crash bandicoot hint

3508
09:07:12,750 --> 09:07:20,319
no I mean I would love to see I'm not I'm not gonna know I'm not gonna say

3509
09:07:20,319 --> 09:07:26,860
it everybody thinks I'm gonna say a certain character at this point no Banjo

3510
09:07:26,860 --> 09:07:30,000
Kazooie would be great I'd love to see Banjo return to a

3511
09:07:30,000 --> 09:07:43,639
Nintendo console he was gonna say Gino no I mean no I'd love to see

3512
09:07:43,639 --> 09:07:52,029
Garfield iconic video game cat I'll give you an eye the off-the-wall one

3513
09:07:52,029 --> 09:08:08,819
here Scrooge McDuck get Scrooge McDuck in there he would be perfect you can't

3514
09:08:08,819 --> 09:08:13,300
tell me that Scrooge McDuck would not fit in that especially really

3515
09:08:13,300 --> 09:08:18,019
really popular old retro game that was on the regular Nintendo it was a

3516
09:08:18,019 --> 09:08:24,230
cool awesome game loved by millions his move set it just made itself the

3517
09:08:24,230 --> 09:08:30,870
Pogo the bring bring he's got the his side smash could be the cane swing he's

3518
09:08:30,870 --> 09:08:50,050
got the whole thing the little gems he could throw money out and shit maybe but

3519
09:08:50,050 --> 09:08:53,410
that includes Disney and if Disney's gonna get included then Sora is gonna

3520
09:08:53,410 --> 09:08:59,059
be put in the game it's not gonna be anybody else if there is gonna be a

3521
09:08:59,059 --> 09:09:06,279
big Disney Square or something DLC it's gonna be Sora and I don't want it to

3522
09:09:06,279 --> 09:09:22,599
be but it makes the most sense Kingdom Hearts is right on the horizon square

3523
09:09:22,599 --> 09:09:26,779
doesn't own Sora Disney does that's not like a joint partnership who square

3524
09:09:26,779 --> 09:09:35,410
does not own any of those characters it's all Disney really but there you

3525
09:09:35,410 --> 09:09:46,300
go Scrooge McDuck or banjo cuz we there's your answer thank you no

3539
09:11:55,330 --> 09:12:00,620
that voice when I anytime I look at my dog my dog will just look at

3540
09:12:00,620 --> 09:12:04,139
me and I'll just start talking as if I'm him talking why do we do that what's

3541
09:12:04,139 --> 09:12:13,139
wrong with human beings every time we see an animal we talk out loud as us

3542
09:12:13,139 --> 09:12:26,580
talking pretending to be the animal talking why I don't do that that's

3543
09:12:26,580 --> 09:12:37,839
just you what I think that's just you it's like a baby voice with

3544
09:12:37,839 --> 09:12:42,080
infants yeah but with the baby voice with infants you're not going like

3549
09:12:59,529 --> 09:13:08,959
nobody says I they do it with a dog because we wish that they could talk

3550
09:13:08,959 --> 09:13:16,569
because that's what we hope that they would say that makes sense there's a

3551
09:13:16,569 --> 09:13:32,559

Draker thanks for the $1 have you ever been recognized in real life by a

3620
09:22:08,629 --> 09:22:11,110
fan at a convention or otherwise also are you ever going to stream

oblivion or red dead 2 again German heart it's happened yeah about that

3622
09:22:16,940 --> 09:22:33,949
frequently that happens usually at a convention maybe once a year no I mean

3623
09:22:33,949 --> 09:22:40,540
I'm I don't really put myself out there very much like I mean conventions

3624
09:22:40,540 --> 09:22:44,059
and shit I do like a little meetup I'll put it like a tweet out but I've

3625
09:22:44,059 --> 09:22:49,379
never really done like a twitch sponsored kind of meet-and-greet we

3626
09:22:49,379 --> 09:22:52,699
wait in a line or something like that so there really only is one way

3627
09:22:52,699 --> 09:22:55,300
you can ever see me at a convention and that's if you see me on the

3628
09:22:55,300 --> 09:22:59,540
floor or if you happen to come to the you know and I tweet out where I'm

3629

standing for like an hour you know I mean it's cool though so it's really

3630
09:23:12,069 --> 09:23:18,900
interesting when that happens you just really never expect that the couple

3631
09:23:18,900 --> 09:23:22,540
of times that it's happened outside of a convention you have really was

3632
09:23:22,540 --> 09:23:34,260

benzo withdrawals for the last month and a half and your streams are just

3639
09:24:09,650 --> 09:24:13,089

hard to do it's Rizgar thanks for the $1 hey Jermboy might have zoned out but

3652
09:26:07,309 --> 09:26:10,309
I think you skipped my bits earlier either way wanted to know if you

3653
09:26:10,309 --> 09:26:12,589
would consider it would decide to show up on another podcast or

3654
09:26:12,589 --> 09:26:21,529
something but it was hilarious when you were on criticals podcast I mean

3655
09:26:21,529 --> 09:26:27,540
not necessarily I mean I just end up being invited on some things sometimes

3656
09:26:27,540 --> 09:26:40,580
and yeah I guess I'll do it I don't have any intention to go on podcasts

3657
09:26:40,580 --> 09:26:52,529
or kind of IEC the collab with X or collab with Y you know it just happens

3658
09:26:52,529 --> 09:27:04,169
sometimes did Drake call back yet yeah I buttoned him didn't even let it

3659
09:27:04,169 --> 09:27:17,940
ring once it was like done I caught it immediately thank you Clueless sniper for

3660
09:27:17,940 --> 09:27:25,059
the $1 thank you boss for Oya for the $1 during a serious question this time

3661
09:27:25,059 --> 09:27:28,989
do you have any advice to give to a perfectionist I often feel like if I

3662
09:27:28,989 --> 09:27:32,150
don't do something to the fullest of my abilities there's no point in

3663
09:27:32,150 --> 09:27:35,510
doing it at all it can be a suffocating and depressing way to view

3664
09:27:35,510 --> 09:27:38,430
the world but I don't know how to drop it PS your hair does look good

3665
09:27:38,430 --> 09:27:44,250
I'm just used to short hair and couldn't handle the change advice for

3666
09:27:44,250 --> 09:27:57,389
perfectionist except the fact that you trying your best is good enough you

3667
09:27:57,389 --> 09:28:04,580
have to accept the fact that it can't be perfect I have to come to terms

3668
09:28:04,580 --> 09:28:08,769
with kind of just kind of shit all the time whether it's in your daily

3669
09:28:08,769 --> 09:28:15,699
life or you know something with the stream that I want to do nobody is

3670
09:28:15,699 --> 09:28:21,550
Superman it's impossible to hold yourself to that kind of a standard

3671
09:28:21,550 --> 09:28:35,860
except my dad well alright except your dad is Superman but not

3672
09:28:35,900 --> 09:28:49,010
everybody's dad is Superman but as long as you get what you're doing to a level

3673
09:28:49,010 --> 09:29:01,050
that you think is good do it you know you can do something to the fullest of

3674
09:29:01,050 --> 09:29:05,989
your abilities but fullest of your abilities does not always necessarily

3675
09:29:05,989 --> 09:29:10,980
have to have to mean perfect you can be really good at something but it

3676
09:29:10,980 --> 09:29:41,169
doesn't have to be perfect every time not perfect what is perfection that's

3677
09:29:41,169 --> 09:29:46,349
a whole not the story that's a whole nother conversation but allow

3678
09:29:46,349 --> 09:29:56,809
yourself to have faults otherwise you'll just drive yourself crazy but thank you

3679
09:29:56,809 --> 09:30:07,459
