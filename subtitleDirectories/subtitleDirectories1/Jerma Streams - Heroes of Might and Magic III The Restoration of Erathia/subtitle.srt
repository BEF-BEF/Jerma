1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:04,599
I don't know. I have no idea what happened. I told like to reverse countdown.

2
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:18,730
And my fucking stream just turned on. So that's the new feature. Okay. Yep. I'll see you later.

3
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:23,059
I guess I have to do something. I don't know. I wasn't playing on stream for like another four hours.

4
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:30,579
All right. Yep. Hey, what's happening everybody? Welcome to the stream.

5
00:00:31,219 --> 00:00:37,509
Oh, we're starting. This is when I, this is when I'm starting. Stream in orbit soon.

6
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:49,369
All right. Uh, actually give me one second. I need to move a few windows. See you in a minute or two.

7
00:01:52,870 --> 00:02:01,060
All right. So today we're doing something, uh, kind of just came out of the blue for no reason

8
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:07,260
last week. Just decided that this is what we're going to do today and probably tomorrow too.

9
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:14,199
Depends on how much fun everybody thinks this is. I think it's going to be fun. We're going to do

10
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:20,120
heroes of might and magic three. I know it's kind of odd that it was just white. Wait, why are you

11
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:25,110
playing this right now? Well, it just kind of came up. I remembered how much I loved this game

12
00:02:26,199 --> 00:02:30,090
and we're going to play it. This is going to be a real comfortable stream.

13
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:38,250
Now I'm going to be passing out blankets and, uh, eye masks over the course of this stream flight.

14
00:02:38,969 --> 00:02:47,699
Feel free. By the way, they're all, they're all, um, $6. So, I mean, I'm not going to be passing

15
00:02:47,699 --> 00:02:58,599
them out. I mean, you're going to be paying for them as I walk by in the aisle. Don't make,

16
00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:03,500
don't make any loud noises. Are you like, no, no, you can't like make like a loud noise,

17
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:11,900
like on any transportation. Don't make any loud noises and just watch the screen. We will be

18
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:27,860
arriving in Amsterdam in about 12 hours. So have a good trip here. Stream trip. Why are we going to

19
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:36,740
Amsterdam? It was the first, it was first like city and like European place I could think of

20
00:03:37,379 --> 00:03:41,719
in the 10 seconds I was reaching for one. But yeah, we're going to play. Uh, this is a classic

21
00:03:41,719 --> 00:03:45,879
game. Uh, a lot of people are going to be confused when we first play cause there's a lot going on

22
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:50,680
in the game. And I even don't know a shitload of the stuff that's going on in this game.

23
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:57,479
I loved this game when I was a kid, when I was a teenager and I didn't even fucking understand

24
00:03:57,479 --> 00:04:02,199
any of the nuances and the complex systems that could potentially be in the game. I just clicked

25
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:06,360
on stuff and I had fun and I have a basic understanding and I haven't played in a long

26
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:15,340
time. So we're going in with like 14 year old brain into 34 year old body and then

27
00:04:15,979 --> 00:04:20,649
teleport to 2019. So why don't we just show it on the screen so you can see what it looks

28
00:04:20,649 --> 00:04:23,769
like. There it is. Here is a might and magic. Let's get the music turned on. It's a pretty

29
00:04:23,769 --> 00:04:36,920
good soundtrack. One, two, three. It's Mr. Worldwide over here. Yeah. I know you're getting loud.

30
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:42,379
You're getting loud. Quiet down. There's no dancing in the aisles either. I'm seeing,

31
00:04:42,379 --> 00:04:55,560
I'm seeing dancing, please. You're not dancing. Sit down in your seats. Stop. Okay. Fucking dumb

32
00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:02,629
plane that would be. And you're like just on a plane or like a, like a nine hour plane and

33
00:05:02,629 --> 00:05:05,589
you're just sitting in your seat with your iPad and people are just fucking dancing.

34
00:05:07,269 --> 00:05:18,730
You'd just be like, sit down. All right. Here we go. I think there's a campaign in the game,

35
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:23,129
but I don't know if I'm going to do it. I feel like I'd rather do one of the random scenarios

36
00:05:23,209 --> 00:05:31,480
because I've never clicked this button. I've played this game dozens and dozens of times

37
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:40,970
over years. I've never selected this button. I think we can keep it that way. So this is

38
00:05:42,329 --> 00:05:50,459
random scenario. This is all for one. Let's see available scenarios because you can do random

39
00:05:50,459 --> 00:05:57,560
map. You can do random scenarios and they all are different completely. You can have up to like

40
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:02,490
eight people in a game. There's no multiplayer on this one, unfortunately,

41
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:16,139
because it is the old version. Rush the capital. I want to play. I want to play. Let us in. You

42
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:22,360
can't, what do you mean let us in? This is not pirated version. I bought this from good old games.

43
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:30,410
Don't pirate this. Buy it. It's good. It's worth your $10. I don't think we can smart click this.

44
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:35,660
Let's just find an interesting one. Do this Warlords. I'll read them for you. All right.

45
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:39,819
Here we go. I'm going to read, how many are there? I'm not going to read them all. That's too many.

46
00:06:39,819 --> 00:06:47,259
Let's find one that I think is cool and then I'll read it out loud. Let us click. The bubble

47
00:06:47,259 --> 00:06:54,100
won't even be here. If you click here, you're going to click here and here and here. No,

48
00:06:54,100 --> 00:07:01,689
I'm clicking one. A brave new world. A great upheaval shook the very foundations of the world,

49
00:07:01,689 --> 00:07:06,569
breaking apart continents and dividing territories in new ways. After the earth stood still once

50
00:07:06,569 --> 00:07:11,129
more, the people crawled out from their hiding places. They began to rebuild in this brave new

51
00:07:11,129 --> 00:07:22,379
world. No one's clicking. Sit down in your seats. Yada, yada, yada. No one's clicking on my screen.

52
00:07:22,379 --> 00:07:28,740
Okay. No one's clicking once and we need to do map size. Let's do like medium. This is the first,

53
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:35,930
okay. This is the first scenario. I just need to show you guys how to play. Here,

54
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:47,220
like how about this one? Like deluge. I need to get back into the swinging thing.

55
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:51,779
Pick elbow. All right. I could do that. This world ain't big enough. No, no, no. This is

56
00:07:51,779 --> 00:07:57,110
going to be too hard. All right. Here we go. I'm just going to do random scenario. Here we go.

57
00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:04,149
I'm going for it. Um, let's go for, uh, I don't know. Let's, um, roll the dice. Here we go. One,

58
00:08:04,149 --> 00:08:11,459
two, three. Start, starting here. Just to visit. Emerald Isles. Step by step. Harsh winter. Uh,

59
00:08:11,459 --> 00:08:16,300
rumble in the bogs. Carpe diem. Seize the day. A few years back, the gods decided they no longer

60
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:20,060
wanted any part in this world. Now there is total anarchy. Everybody blames everyone else for the

61
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:24,300
gods abandoning them while sitting in the throne room. You decided you were the only person fit to

62
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:37,750
rule. Carpe diem. Here we go. Uh, lose, defeat everybody, kill everybody. And we've got player,

63
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:44,230
uh, difficulty is on 160%. I don't want that. I just want it on like a hundred percent or just

64
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:49,269
right in the middle. What does this mean? I don't know what that means. I know what that means. I

65
00:08:49,269 --> 00:09:01,419
don't know what this one means. I'm not going all the way up here. 130. Rumble. Rumble in the bogs.

66
00:09:01,419 --> 00:09:12,620
It's difficulty scaling. So this should just be right in the middle. 130. I'll take it. I'm not

67
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:16,600
going to max it. I'm not for the first one. All right, here we go. Ready? What about advanced

68
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:21,220
options? Oh shit. Hold on. Starting town. Oh, that's important. This is important. This is me.

69
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:32,649
I need to pick my flag. Which flag do I want to be? Do I want to be red, blue, um, sand, green,

70
00:09:32,649 --> 00:09:43,740
orange, or purple? Green. All right. Starting town. Uh, we can pick starting towns here. I think

71
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:48,600
we should just do, should we just do, what do you think? Who should I be? Who should I start as?

72
00:09:48,600 --> 00:10:02,600
Should I be? Oh, here we go. Okay. That's all I needed to see. All right. Uh, where do I want to

73
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:08,889
go? Town alignment. Castle. Associated creatures. Pipeman, archer, griffin, uh, the swordsman,

74
00:10:08,889 --> 00:10:14,919
the monk, the cavalier, and the angel. There's, okay, so this is kind of standard fantasy, uh,

75
00:10:14,919 --> 00:10:21,700
knights and archers and griffins. This one is more fan, like fantasy creatures like dwarves and

76
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:27,450
elves and centaurs and unicorns. Uh, this is the tower. So is this, this is like a fantasy

77
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:35,350
styled creatures. Gremlin, gargoyle, golem, mage, genie. I think I want this one. This inferno is a

78
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:40,919
little geared more towards like high fantasy. So you have imp, uh, gog, hellhound, demon,

79
00:10:43,799 --> 00:10:53,720
pit fiend. That's kind of cool. Necropolis. I don't have any other way to describe anything.

80
00:10:53,720 --> 00:11:03,909
Um, this is a, I don't know. I like this one though. Skeletons, lich, black, uh, black knight,

81
00:11:03,909 --> 00:11:16,039
bone dragon, harpy beholder, medusa, goblin. These are like orcs, gnoll, lizard van, serpent fly,

82
00:11:17,669 --> 00:11:26,009
firebird, elementals. All right. I think I'm going to go with the gremlins. I think so.

83
00:11:26,009 --> 00:11:39,419
The tower. We get gremlins. We get stone golems. We get mages. Oh, should I need a new? Hmm. I

84
00:11:39,419 --> 00:11:46,200
like this one. That's just the, you took a photo of me and I'm not photogenic and I wasn't ready

85
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:54,100
for it. And that's how we look at every picture. Torosar. I need a better name. So we rename. I

86
00:11:54,100 --> 00:12:08,299
don't think we can rename Torosar. I think that's good. Everybody else can be random. That's fine.

87
00:12:08,299 --> 00:12:15,190
We don't need to do any of this. That's where we're going to start. Everyone else's computer

88
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:26,620
and we're on normal difficulty. Three, two, one. It is your belief that the gods didn't

89
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:31,340
abandon their people, but the people have abandoned their gods. To bring the gods back,

90
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:39,860
you must make the people believe in the gods again by force if necessary. Here is your castle. This

91
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:47,580
is where you stand. This is your stronghold. Here's the map. It goes eons and eons and light years

92
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:52,460
away from you. You step out of the castle and you see, I'm not going to narrate this whole thing.

93
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:59,049
So here's my magic. If you want to know how this works, do not be deceived by this initial

94
00:12:59,049 --> 00:13:03,929
overworld map. Oh, it's a click game and you click around and you, oh, look at that. Oh, it's fun.

95
00:13:03,929 --> 00:13:09,129
No, no, there's way more than that. There's a whole full combat system, 2D and potentially 3D.

96
00:13:09,129 --> 00:13:16,820
This is an isometric 3D. The game works based around exploring and getting stronger and leveling

97
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:21,539
up and leveling up your creatures and having thousands of them and having them fight. I hope

98
00:13:21,539 --> 00:13:30,279
you're ready for the best fucking game you will ever see ever in your entire life on this channel.

99
00:13:30,279 --> 00:13:36,470
Here we go. So let's go look at the castle. This is our, where we are right now. This is who we

100
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:48,840
have. We have the fucking random, I like hate this guy already. So we have 31 gremlins. They're like

101
00:13:48,919 --> 00:13:57,750
jesters. Okay. They, uh, 31 of them. We've got three stone golems. There are 16 available gremlins

102
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:04,740
right now. That's too many gremlins to have. No, I want like 500 of them. Not playing as the

103
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:09,620
skeletons. Dropped. Well, this is the first scenario. We can play more scenarios. I'm excited.

104
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:17,779
I'm like, emotions are overwhelming me right now. How this works is these are all the monsters we

105
00:14:17,779 --> 00:14:23,399
can eventually make. Eventually we can have just giant guy with like a lightsaber. It's awesome.

106
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:29,509
The genies, the mages, stone gargoyles. This is a lot of cool things. And these are the most,

107
00:14:29,509 --> 00:14:33,429
obviously, most powerful units you can make. But for the purposes of what's happening here,

108
00:14:33,429 --> 00:14:40,440
this is your tree. Yep. It's a tree. All of these have a function and they all cost a certain amount

109
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:45,639
of resources. So for instance, the blacksmith, uh, the blacksmith provides your armies with

110
00:14:45,639 --> 00:14:52,250
ammo carts. Okay. Well that's a thousand gold and five wood. I got 15 wood. You get resources by

111
00:14:52,250 --> 00:15:03,000
claiming territory or by trading it or by finding it. Are we understanding here? You can upgrade

112
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:11,419
your tower. You can upgrade your buildings and bases many, many times. This is a cool mobile ad

113
00:15:11,419 --> 00:15:16,740
stream. Now I'm just taking it slow because people are going to have a lot of questions.

114
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:23,059
Let's do it very good. Okay. Golem factory. The golem factory allows you to recruit stone golems.

115
00:15:23,059 --> 00:15:29,860
It's five wood, five, um, hair balls and $2,000. I'm going to get that because I want to be able

116
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:39,210
to start having goblins, goblins. Here we go. There it is right there. Six of these are recruited a

117
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:54,500
week. I can buy six per week. It's 900 bucks. As you see, I'm going to buy them. I'm going to

118
00:15:54,500 --> 00:16:02,100
recruit them right now. Here we go. See now we got a nine. If you don't leave anything here,

119
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:09,720
your castle can be claimed by other people. So if I don't have, for instance, if I can put, um,

120
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:16,019
like, oh, let's put, uh, you can split them up too. So I'm going to leave, uh, I'll leave like two,

121
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:20,549
I'll leave two of these guys here. Now they're going to get wiped out of the castle that has

122
00:16:20,549 --> 00:16:25,620
ever breached. Who cares, right? I don't need anybody defending the castle right now. I'm

123
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:31,740
going to just take everybody. But this is where you do most of your maintenance. Now you probably,

124
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:35,899
oh, that was fucking awesome, Jeremy. Like, holy shit, that was the fucking coolest thing you've

125
00:16:35,899 --> 00:16:42,710
ever shown us. I know. So here we go. Ready? You go by, uh, you can only go a certain amount of

126
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:51,639
paces per turn, right? So here's how far I can move. Every single one of these things is

127
00:16:51,639 --> 00:16:57,320
interactable and they have consequences. They have choices. There are a pack of wood elves here and

128
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:01,399
there's something behind them. A monolith one-way entrance. I don't even know what the fuck that is.

129
00:17:01,399 --> 00:17:06,230
I have no idea what that is. I wish I could tell you what that was. I don't know if I'm,

130
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:10,390
a pack of wood elves, we might be able to kill them. I don't know. Maybe I'll try.

131
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:17,779
First of all, let's pick up this, uh, this treasure chest. Oh, after scouring the area,

132
00:17:17,779 --> 00:17:21,619
you fall upon a hidden treasure trash. You may take the gold or distribute it to the

133
00:17:21,619 --> 00:17:25,690
peasants for experience. Which do you choose? This is important because you can take money

134
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:29,769
and be able to buy things, or you can take experience, which levels up your hero,

135
00:17:29,769 --> 00:17:36,279
which then lets you put skill points in, which lets you do more, better things.

136
00:17:36,279 --> 00:17:45,480
I think I'm going to do experience. You have to pick this every time. Let's pick experience.

137
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:54,309
Bingo. Taurosar is now level two alchemist. Spell power plus one. Or, well, no, this is,

138
00:17:54,309 --> 00:17:58,869
you can pick one of these two. You can pick either advanced tactics or basic ballistics.

139
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:07,259
I don't know what those are. Just sit on. Advanced tactics allow you to rearrange your troops just

140
00:18:07,259 --> 00:18:13,000
before combat within five hex rows of the commanding hero. Fuck man. That sounds pretty

141
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:18,339
good. Basic ballistics gives control of the catapult to the hero, allowing aim shots with

142
00:18:18,339 --> 00:18:23,000
increased damage. That's if you're breaching buildings, if you're breaching towers. Um,

143
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,269
I don't know. They both sound pretty good. I would probably say basic ballistics because that's

144
00:18:27,269 --> 00:18:35,190
how you really take over capsules very well. You sound so excited. I love this game. This is like

145
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:40,470
one of my favorite things ever. This, this is like, uh, yeah, this is what like a sponsored stream

146
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:44,789
would sound like. But this is like a, I'm sponsoring this game. You know what I mean?

147
00:18:44,789 --> 00:18:51,180
Like I'm sponsoring this stream. It's me. I'm going to do ballistics. You know what I'm saying?

148
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:56,660
This is me sponsoring this game. They're not sponsoring me. I'm sponsoring them. I bought

149
00:18:56,660 --> 00:19:02,730
this game for 10 bucks and I'm telling you to play it. All right. So we've got a scholar here.

150
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:06,250
Ooh, I don't know what to do because I only get a certain amount of things I can do per turn.

151
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:11,539
Remember, this is very important. Everybody listen to me and stop talking during class.

152
00:19:11,539 --> 00:19:19,289
Oh, Dave, back there. We don't, there's no food allowed in the classroom. And, uh, Karen, Karen,

153
00:19:19,289 --> 00:19:24,619
you like to pass notes, huh? Is that what you're doing? Oh, let's see. Let me see that. Let me see

154
00:19:24,619 --> 00:19:36,619
that. Thank you. What does it say? Oh, the teacher's ass is fucking huge. I wonder how he fits

155
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:43,259
at his desk. He probably desperately needs two seats for one for each, each ass cheek.

156
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:49,579
Fucking funny. Sit down. Every single one of you is coming after school for detention.

157
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:57,690
What, you didn't do anything? Doesn't matter. You all have to think about what you've done.

158
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:03,640
Unbelievable. Okay. So let's go to the windmill. Ready? Ready?

159
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:16,650
The windmill had five, um, whatever that is. That's all that was there. Sometimes it could

160
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:20,009
be something bad. Sometimes it could be a scenario. All right. Should I talk to the scholar?

161
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:25,299
As you ride into a clearing, you notice a university scholar resting his horse.

162
00:20:25,299 --> 00:20:35,019
He agrees to teach you some of what he knows before setting off. Basic fire magic. I think

163
00:20:35,019 --> 00:20:39,019
we just got easy mode right here. Basic. Can I learn that though? Okay. So what do I hold? Let me

164
00:20:39,019 --> 00:20:46,809
see. Basic fire magic. Cast fire spells at a reduced cost. Ooh, but I don't know any spells

165
00:20:46,809 --> 00:20:55,990
though. Where's my spell book? I don't think I have any, uh, spells. Where's the spell book? I know

166
00:20:55,990 --> 00:21:05,900
it's like a certain button you press. I don't remember. I'll figure it out. Anyways. Okay.

167
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:13,799
Here's some wood. That was six wood. These don't respond by the way. There's seven, um, crystals.

168
00:21:14,519 --> 00:21:19,670
Do you think I'm prepared to do this? What if I just lose? Uh, I'm, I'm out of time. I can't,

169
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:24,230
my turn is over. So as you can see, I can't go anywhere else. The only way it would be possible

170
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:28,150
for me to do anything else is if I had another hero, which you can recruit. They cost money.

171
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:36,140
By the way, that windmill sound is a, is somebody, is a page turning sound effect

172
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:42,009
that has been looped over and over again. Some, it's really pretty interesting. All right. So

173
00:21:42,809 --> 00:21:45,289
uh, I can go to the kingdom. We can see the whole world. We don't really do much of that

174
00:21:45,289 --> 00:21:53,400
right now. I can end my turn. That's all I can do. I'm done. End turn. Right. Ooh. Okay. It's our

175
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:59,579
turn again. Everybody else has moved. Everybody else has done something. Let's go to the shrine

176
00:21:59,579 --> 00:22:14,630
of magic thought land mine. What does that mean? Land mine. I just exploded. I feel like I want

177
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:17,750
to try to fight this guy. Who do I have in mind? I got, I know I've got plenty of people. Let's

178
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:38,940
see if I can do it. Here we go. What? Why, why didn't I get to fight? What just happened? Um,

179
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:45,140
what, why did that happen? That's not supposed to happen. That's not, I'm okay. I'm telling you

180
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:51,299
that was absolutely not supposed to. I've auto combat on. Why would nine golems and 31 goblins

181
00:22:51,779 --> 00:23:02,900
lose to six archers? Even in an auto scenario and Taurasara is dead. He's abandoned me. What?

182
00:23:07,670 --> 00:23:18,819
Okay. What's, okay. It's it. I'm really confused in the, yeah. Okay. I need to, I need to let go

183
00:23:18,819 --> 00:23:24,259
in the settings and turn that off. Okay. That's part of the HD mod. This is, I don't have the

184
00:23:24,259 --> 00:23:31,690
HD mod. This is just from good old games. All right. But anyways, more importantly, um,

185
00:23:32,329 --> 00:23:37,690
the hero with a higher tactic skill can arrange their armies before any combat begins. So before

186
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:43,829
combat begins, I can move, as you see, I've got these slots here. I'm going to try to get behind

187
00:23:43,829 --> 00:23:48,950
this because that can give me line of sight. I don't have any ranged, so I'm kind of, I might

188
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:56,039
just be fucked anyways. Uh, we're just going to move forward and it's now my turn. They don't have

189
00:23:56,039 --> 00:24:00,839
any active spells. Their, their morale is whatever. Fuck them. Damage three to five.

190
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:08,279
As long as I can, I might actually lose here. I actually might lose here. All right. That looks

191
00:24:08,279 --> 00:24:17,019
fine. This is bad. This is going to be bad. I'm going to lose. I'm, I'm fucked. I just wanted to

192
00:24:17,019 --> 00:24:28,180
show you what combat looked like. I might be able to do it. I might, it's possible. What about, do

193
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:42,299
I have any spells? Magic arrow. He can't, I can't do it. Yeah, I can. Here we go. All right. I killed

194
00:24:42,299 --> 00:24:50,440
two of them. I'm going to go for it. They're going to kill these. This is bad. I'm going

195
00:24:51,240 --> 00:25:02,440
right down to the bottom here. Come on. No, he's dead. I gotta do it again. The hero might be able

196
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:12,259
to do this. It's very possible. Come on. Here we go. All right. So once you get to this point

197
00:25:12,259 --> 00:25:17,700
where I can actually get close enough to attack, you can get in there and choose any angles you

198
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:25,849
really want to from whatever hex you want to do. I'm going to do from here. Sometimes I have,

199
00:25:25,849 --> 00:25:31,480
they can retaliate and when they retaliate, it does a certain amount of percentage of damage.

200
00:25:32,039 --> 00:25:38,970
We're going to go right here. He's trying to run away. That's fine. We'll get under here.

201
00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:49,210
These guys are stronger. Remember, let me slow this in. Okay. Wait, wait, wait. Hold on. Yeah. All

202
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:57,500
right. All right. Slow down the animations. It was going like really fast. Come on. Stay alive. I

203
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:07,609
don't want to use any spells. I have to. All right. Take them out and then get yourself over here.

204
00:26:10,099 --> 00:26:23,190
He's alive. Very good. And that's a victory. A glorious victory for Valorant in combat.

205
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:29,450
Taurasar receives 250 experience. And here are your attackers and here's your defenders of 16

206
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:39,480
archers. We lost almost every single person. But did we? We're still all right. Remember,

207
00:26:40,039 --> 00:26:47,880
every week you get more. They're back at the town. See? Ready? They're currently,

208
00:26:48,839 --> 00:26:53,930
how do I get a good view of that? View towns. Okay. This is my only town that I have.

209
00:26:55,619 --> 00:27:00,180
I think I actually have to physically go in here to see it. Don't I? I thought I,

210
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:08,150
can I just go look? Kingdom overview. Okay. See it here. Creatures available. So right.

211
00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:16,039
It's, I can, I can go get 16 ramlins, but I need to get, okay, this is gold. Let's get it.

212
00:27:16,599 --> 00:27:21,210
That was a thousand gold. Pretty cool. I don't know what this is. I'm kind of scared to click

213
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:26,900
it because I have, I have four, I have four golems and if there's like a monster in there,

214
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:35,779
I'm dead. There we go. Okay. So you don't have to be, your hero doesn't have to go in.

215
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:43,859
Here's our town. This is who's available to recruit. There's none here because they have,

216
00:27:43,859 --> 00:27:51,259
it's by week. You can actually recruit all available creatures. Now let's see what we got.

217
00:27:51,259 --> 00:27:55,509
Tavern. I can get another hero, but I don't think I want to do that because I'm,

218
00:27:55,509 --> 00:28:02,069
I don't want to spread myself out. Arch Magi throw magic with a precision greater than most archers.

219
00:28:02,069 --> 00:28:09,240
So we have a wizard and necromancer that are available to hire. You can get astral or nimbus

220
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:15,880
and that is a necromancer. Get the necromancer, but I'm not going to take the necromancer out.

221
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:23,109
I don't want to get too many heroes. That's 2,500 bucks. All right. Fine. We don't want to,

222
00:28:23,109 --> 00:28:28,779
remember money is, money's important. I just bumped the mic. I know. So we have skeletons

223
00:28:28,779 --> 00:28:36,390
and walking dead. That's what he starts with and we may as well. Um, just it's, that's a lot of

224
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:43,000
money, but recruit and we're going to, we're going to stack this guy. So he's got three, uh,

225
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:50,250
different creatures. I don't think any of these are ranged. And now as you see, here's the window.

226
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:55,140
I have two different options to where I want to go. I might just throw this guy away. Let's just go

227
00:28:55,140 --> 00:29:06,230
and let's go in the portal. What I ended up over here. All right. Uh, this is somebody's kingdom.

228
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:13,640
This just took me right to the front door of somebody's house. Should I go in? Is there

229
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:18,519
anybody in there? There's nobody even here. There's like two frogs guarding this place.

230
00:29:18,519 --> 00:29:28,309
I'm taking this one. I'm at, I'm out of turns. All right. There's like literally one frog here.

231
00:29:28,309 --> 00:29:36,329
Let's go through here. I'm going to go this way with this guy because there's a pack of hobgoblins.

232
00:29:36,890 --> 00:29:45,900
Let's get the ore. Let's get some gems. Another scenario where I can do, let's level them up.

233
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:51,400
Didn't level up. Okay. That's fine. Warrior's tomb, not visited. Go in there.

234
00:29:52,279 --> 00:29:59,880
Okay. You have come upon the resting place of a nameless warrior. Do you wish to search the

235
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:11,240
tomb? Don't do it. Don't. Should I go in there? What if there's like gold in there? I don't have,

236
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:17,799
but my, I don't have my creatures. Like I, let's go for it. Reluctantly, your troops enter the

237
00:30:17,799 --> 00:30:26,660
tomb, finding the vial of lifeblood, but such a despicable act has ruined your army's morale.

238
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:38,390
Oh damn. This item increases the health of all your units by plus two. Holy shit. That's pretty

239
00:30:38,390 --> 00:30:47,029
great. Actually everyone has plus two health. So you mean, oh wait, 16 plus two. What do you mean?

240
00:30:47,029 --> 00:30:50,549
No. So those of you that are still maybe a little confused, if you're not, then you know, that's

241
00:30:50,549 --> 00:30:56,470
fine. But for the people that don't get it. So there are 16 gremlins in here. It looks like one

242
00:30:56,470 --> 00:31:16,680
on the screen, but it's 16. So that means 16 times six instead of 16 times four. See six at 15 health

243
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:21,259
every, each, all of them. You know what I'm saying? Just want to just, just get you unaware

244
00:31:21,259 --> 00:31:24,220
of what's happening. You know, just so you can see. All right. Well that was a good, that was

245
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:30,839
pretty good outcome. Let's get going. I'm out of time, I think. Let's end this turn. All right.

246
00:31:30,839 --> 00:31:45,109
Do you think I can do this? Should I just, I, I don't think I can kill this one frog. Frog didn't

247
00:31:45,109 --> 00:32:12,980
build. I gotta go in and turn that off. I don't want to see the outcome. So there's 13 frogs

248
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:21,849
and I've got, let's move forward a little bit here. This, yeah, cause this said this is going

249
00:32:21,849 --> 00:32:26,089
to get launched. I have, remember the basic military, whatever basic ballistics. This is

250
00:32:26,089 --> 00:32:34,170
why you have it. Because you want to take down walls. I wouldn't be able to do anything if I

251
00:32:34,170 --> 00:32:37,369
didn't have this. Here come the frogs. They're coming out the front door. Why are you coming

252
00:32:37,369 --> 00:32:50,490
out the front door? All right. Back it up. Cause he'll waste a turn. Okay. Can I just kill him?

253
00:32:57,029 --> 00:33:01,740
All right. These things, these things are really weak. I'm probably just going to retaliate and

254
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:13,049
win. Uh, I don't think he can do anything. They just wait. Oh, fuck. He's good. He's

255
00:33:13,049 --> 00:33:32,950
trying to kill it. Can he destroy that? Fucking frogs. 565 experience. Apply batteries out. Yes.

256
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:40,299
There we go. All right. Level three alchemist. Defense plus one. Everybody in the party gets

257
00:33:40,299 --> 00:33:48,660
plus one. And then I can do basic archery or advanced tactics. Um, let's see. Basic archery

258
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:53,220
increases damage done by range attacking creatures by 10%. I don't have any, but it's

259
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:57,700
probably going to do to get it. Cause I'll probably eventually have some monsters of archery. And now

260
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:11,159
here we are. I can now recruit. Oh yeah. This is mine now. How much do these cost?

261
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:24,539
We've got a tavern town hall fort. I can level one ranger. No, no, not a one heroes right now.

262
00:34:26,579 --> 00:34:32,059
Harpies. All right. How much is it to recruit all these? It's a lot of money, but I could deck

263
00:34:32,059 --> 00:34:39,719
him out. Beholders. Are these ranged? What do you think Chuck? I'm just taking them. Let's do it.

264
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:53,780
Let's get off a nice little army here. I mean the frogs suck, but it's okay.

265
00:34:54,659 --> 00:35:02,579
Get more frogmen. Uh, I have to wait till they, um, grow. All right. So I have Evernight and

266
00:35:02,579 --> 00:35:07,800
Stronggale. Evernight is the other castle that I own. All right. We're going to hang out here.

267
00:35:08,519 --> 00:35:13,460
Let's see. Should I buy something? What can I upgrade? Marketplace Citadel.

268
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:19,429
Including a 50% increase to base creature growth. The Citadel adds a keep and other terrain

269
00:35:19,429 --> 00:35:25,289
obstacles in a town's defense. So I can increase the growth portal of summoning. You can recruit

270
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:35,900
creatures from an externally flogged flagged dwelling. Uh, blacksmith is, you can make the

271
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:42,469
list as mushroom rings. The mushroom rings increase Troglodyte production by seven per week.

272
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:47,190
I think we should do that. By the way, you can only do one, you can only build once per week.

273
00:35:47,989 --> 00:35:54,059
So we're going to get some more frog recruits. I can no longer do anything here, but back here

274
00:35:54,059 --> 00:35:57,099
I also, I don't want to bleed my money completely. That's the thing. You have to be careful.

275
00:35:59,719 --> 00:36:04,820
Citadel. Uh, and just in case somebody comes, I'm going to get the Citadel. I'm going to build the

276
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:14,380
Citadel. More base creature growth. This is getting, ah, spells. I need spells. This is the spell

277
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:22,710
tower. And then in here, summon boat. Summons an existing friendly unoccupied boat from anywhere

278
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:30,409
in the world to your location. Chances for success at 50%. Dispel, magic arrow, slow. Okay. So I have

279
00:36:30,409 --> 00:36:37,340
to bring somebody in here. I have my mage who's currently the necromancer. Does that count?

280
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:44,500
All right. Well, I'm, it's a new day. Spell points. Let's go, let's bring you in here.

281
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:52,360
Oh no, actually you're on the other side of the world. Sulfur. Uh, a little hut. Would you

282
00:36:52,360 --> 00:37:03,980
like to recruit halflings? 15 halflings. Join your army. Nice place that they'd like to be.

283
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:12,889
Shrine of Magic. No longer have. Ooh, this crest is up there. Let me go. Did I go to this windmill?

284
00:37:12,889 --> 00:37:23,670
Yeah, I did. Visited. Learn landmine. I wanted to go, what did I want to go, up or down? Um, let's go

285
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:31,059
up because this is mine here. So if you take a look at this, you see that this scattered stuff,

286
00:37:31,059 --> 00:37:37,610
like the scattered ore all over the place, this is an actual like ore pit, which when you claim

287
00:37:37,610 --> 00:37:43,849
these, you just, it will generate resources. So there's a pack of hobgoblins here. Who's in,

288
00:37:43,849 --> 00:37:49,340
who's in this party enough? Oh, I want to, let me just disable this shit. How do I, um,

289
00:37:50,219 --> 00:37:57,059
no, no, no, don't quit. Where's the menu? I just want to get rid of this quick,

290
00:37:57,059 --> 00:38:06,139
get rid of quick combat. Okay. Yeah, there we go. Quick combat disabled. So save the game.

291
00:38:06,699 --> 00:38:14,070
Oh yeah, that's right. You have to do manual saves. Save game. Auto save. Uh,

292
00:38:14,949 --> 00:38:22,599
we're just going to name it first map. First map saved successfully. Here we go.

293
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:30,789
Pack of hobgoblins. Here we go. They want to fight. They can move a lot. They can move very

294
00:38:30,789 --> 00:38:35,510
long way. Eight. This is like, I got enough. Unfortunately, I'm, I don't know if I'm going

295
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:40,469
to be able to, let me see my spells. Shield. Shield's a selected unit reducing the amount

296
00:38:40,469 --> 00:38:44,309
of damage received from hand to hand attacks. I think I'm going to do that to you because

297
00:38:44,309 --> 00:38:51,929
that's where they're going. And I mean, you're not going to be able to move anywhere. He's going to

298
00:38:51,929 --> 00:38:57,860
make it. So might as well just move forward. Uh, you on the other hand, you're going to be,

299
00:38:57,860 --> 00:39:02,099
was he going to cleaver? Oh fuck. I thought I was controlling him. I'm an idiot. No, I'm not.

300
00:39:02,099 --> 00:39:23,690
That's fine. No, he's going for you. Bad. Okay, go in there. Oh, you had nothing. What did he just

301
00:39:23,690 --> 00:39:36,010
do? Shield. Luck. What did he just do? Oh, these guys, they kind of suck. Skeletons are good.

302
00:39:36,889 --> 00:39:45,380
Okay, we're good. That was low morale. Okay, right, right, right. We lost five little gremlins. It's

303
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:53,190
all right. 75 experience and they could just access to this ore pit. Two every day. Forever,

304
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:56,309
unless somebody else claims this. So there's nothing else up here. Wait, artifact.

305
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:10,550
Stoic Watchman. What's that? What's a stoic watchman? This figure increases your eagle eye

306
00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:19,659
skill by 10%. I don't even know what that is. That's hidden back here. All right, so that's all

307
00:40:19,659 --> 00:40:24,940
back here. I have no more things to do. I mean, I guess it could. I only have 50. What do I have? 5600?

308
00:40:28,619 --> 00:40:43,050
5600. No, we just got to end the turns. All right, day four. So I have learned summoned boat.

309
00:40:43,929 --> 00:40:46,949
Although I don't really know for what reason that is.

310
00:40:47,909 --> 00:40:55,300
Kind of went this way, but I want to get the treasure. Um, I'll take the money this time.

311
00:40:56,019 --> 00:41:09,500
Oh, shit. A pack of Gorgons. I don't think I'll be able to beat that. Yeah, I'm not going to chance

312
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:16,860
that one. So Seer's Hut. In order to travel through these dangerous lands, my envoy needs

313
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:22,940
more backup. I hear 60 halflings and 12 trolls are excellent guards. If you were to bring them to me,

314
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:37,500
I would be deeply grateful. Huh. Well, I have, I have a few of them. I don't have a whole lot.

315
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:46,869
I need 60 halflings and 12 trolls. Uh, rally flag. That's out of turn. Let's go back to the

316
00:41:46,869 --> 00:41:55,769
worlds here. All right. So I got 8600. Level two, Citadel Marketplace. You can buy and sell

317
00:41:55,769 --> 00:42:02,199
resources. You exchange things back and forth. That's pretty good. Uh, lookout tower extends

318
00:42:02,199 --> 00:42:06,360
a visible distance around your city. That's pretty good too. Uh, allows you to recruit

319
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:13,219
stone gargoyles. I feel like I'd want this upgraded workshop. Uh, master gremlins are available.

320
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:27,269
Wall of Knowledge increases any hero's knowledge by plus one if they visit. Uh, I'm going to go

321
00:42:27,269 --> 00:42:33,989
with this. I'm going to go with the Citadel. It's, I mean, you need to have like walls,

322
00:42:33,989 --> 00:42:45,099
so they can just walk right in. What's the library? More spells. Yeah. Let's, uh, what do

323
00:42:45,099 --> 00:42:49,420
I need for the city hall? City hall allows you to purchase town structures and earns your kingdom

324
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:54,710
2000 gold per day. I need a marketplace and a blacksmith. I probably should just get the

325
00:42:54,710 --> 00:43:01,880
marketplace. Yeah. Let's just, let's just start that process. So as you see here, I can, you know,

326
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:08,570
for instance, um, I think this changes week to week depending on certain outcomes and certain

327
00:43:08,570 --> 00:43:13,780
seasons. Some things can be worth more money. So here's the resources available to trade. So I can

328
00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:22,019
do, you know, I could trade gems for gold. I can trade, you know, crystals for wood and the ratio

329
00:43:22,019 --> 00:43:29,269
as you see is not very good, but yeah, it's pretty cool. It's pretty cool. So that exists now. Let's

330
00:43:29,269 --> 00:43:41,050
go to the other one. Anything, nobody to recruit. What can I do here? I need to, hmm, 5000. I don't

331
00:43:41,050 --> 00:43:46,980
think I have, I don't really have enough to do this. The Academy of Battle Scholars teaches new

332
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:58,219
skills to any hero once. Pillar of Eyes. The Pillar of Eyes allows you to recruit evil eyes.

333
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:09,260
What is this? You can recruit Medusas with this one. Yeah, this will 2000. I'll get 4,000 per day.

334
00:44:12,099 --> 00:44:18,170
I'm gonna, I'm gonna try to just get two city halls. Let's just go to the marketplace.

335
00:44:24,099 --> 00:44:31,349
Starting to run out of resources here though. All right, let's go. Oh shit. Oh fuck. Oh no.

336
00:44:31,989 --> 00:44:36,119
Okay, this, he's come, that's my house. He's got, he, this is, this is another player.

337
00:44:38,489 --> 00:44:41,849
Uh, he's, he's gonna take me over. He's trying to take, what, what does he have?

338
00:44:44,250 --> 00:44:58,039
I have, pretty decent, what does he have? Several, a horde of skeletons. Uh, what is his stuff?

339
00:44:58,039 --> 00:45:04,230
I can't, I don't know. Destroy him? Kill him. He's got a horde of skeletons. This is probably

340
00:45:04,230 --> 00:45:18,170
gonna be bad. All right, I'm going for it. No, I'm not. He's gonna take the castle. I'm not prepared

341
00:45:18,170 --> 00:45:37,300
for him. I'm just gonna, yeah, I'm gonna go in. Everybody to the battle stations. Wait, I can't,

342
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:59,989
can I not place him up here? There we go. Okay. Um, can I recruit anybody? Is anybody available?

343
00:45:59,989 --> 00:46:13,980
There's nobody available. Uh, should I make something and recruit someone? I don't do,

344
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:23,929
I don't have enough. 2010 and five. I don't have enough money. No, I don't have enough of,

345
00:46:23,929 --> 00:46:40,039
what is it, ore? What am I missing? Wood. Fuck. I need to build the citadel. Quick. Okay, yeah,

346
00:46:40,039 --> 00:46:49,210
I need, I need to add terrain obstacles. Pull up the bridge. Let's go. Wait, hold on. I'm gonna

347
00:46:49,210 --> 00:46:56,150
send reinforcements. Uh, hold on. Blacksmith. I don't know what, I need wood. I gotta go fucking

348
00:46:56,150 --> 00:47:05,349
find wood. How do I need to make wood? Plus one gem every day. I need wood. I need goddamn wood.

349
00:47:05,989 --> 00:47:14,699
But the exchange rate's probably so bad. Let's go to the market. Okay, wood. I need wood.

350
00:47:15,659 --> 00:47:24,150
And I'm gonna give money. I just like fucking almost restarted my computer, I think,

351
00:47:24,150 --> 00:47:35,139
because I just elbowed my, this is so stupid. Supply and demand. Bullshit. Look at that. What

352
00:47:35,139 --> 00:47:57,260
about hay? No, these are all such bad exchange rates. God damn it. No, nothing I can do. No.

353
00:47:57,900 --> 00:48:10,949
How many, how much wood do I have? I need four, right? Uh, trade the M&Ms. No, no, I'll be fine.

354
00:48:10,949 --> 00:48:14,789
I'll be fine. I'm not gonna, I have good troops here. I've got good people here.

355
00:48:15,349 --> 00:48:26,389
I've got, they're garrisoned up and they're ready to go behind walls. Let's just do it. You're out

356
00:48:26,389 --> 00:48:34,900
here. Rally the, rally the troops. I got some luck. I got some morale. Wood. How much is it?

357
00:48:36,070 --> 00:48:45,590
Eight wood. Oh yeah, eight wood. And I got some spell, I got eight spell points. Done. We don't

358
00:48:45,590 --> 00:48:51,480
have to end there. Learning stone. Mercury. All right, don't, don't do anything crazy here. Just

359
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:58,340
get more mercury. I can't, there's an alchemist's lab. What's this thing? Learning stone. Nimbus is

360
00:48:58,340 --> 00:49:08,010
now a level two necromancer. Advanced necromancy or basic wisdom allows 20% of the creatures killed

361
00:49:08,010 --> 00:49:14,809
in combat to be brought back from the dead as skeletons. Basic wisdom allows your hero to learn

362
00:49:14,969 --> 00:49:26,230
third level spells. I mean, yeah. Now we're a real necromancer. I don't have much more wiggle room

363
00:49:26,230 --> 00:49:42,789
here. All right, I need to be ready. So let's go back here. Um, I got, I take the wood. What was

364
00:49:42,789 --> 00:49:50,019
I gonna build with this wood? Blacksmith. Cause then I can do city hall. Yeah. Blacksmith and then

365
00:49:50,019 --> 00:50:01,059
city hall. This is five wood and this is 5,000. Ammo carts. There it is. Blacksmith. Only visiting

366
00:50:01,059 --> 00:50:08,230
heroes may use the blacksmith and then next week I can do a city hall. Cause I already built

367
00:50:08,230 --> 00:50:13,429
something here. It's just at the front fucking door. God damn it. All right. I'm ready. Ready?

368
00:50:14,650 --> 00:50:24,170
Three, two, one. He backed off. He took all my fucking shit though. He took, I was going to get

369
00:50:24,170 --> 00:50:34,889
all this stuff, which that was my stuff. We just ran away for no reason. I just like panicked,

370
00:50:34,889 --> 00:50:56,730
but nothing. Kill him? He's got, how much is a horde? 50 to a hundred? It's a lot. He's

371
00:50:56,730 --> 00:51:06,119
unsuspecting. Got him. I, seven. I told you it was like a hundred. I told you it was a hundred.

372
00:51:10,519 --> 00:51:18,969
All right. What is he? Harpy. Harpies can probably move real fast. All right. I got to play this

373
00:51:18,969 --> 00:51:54,070
smart. The hobbits. I think can you cast like spells? They can't go through the rocks. I'm

374
00:51:54,070 --> 00:52:00,630
terrified of this person. Protect the frog at all costs. Now this is okay. This would be fine.

375
00:52:02,309 --> 00:52:21,610
All right. You ready? I'm ready. Let's get a spell out here. I got magic arrow on, on the whites

376
00:52:22,250 --> 00:52:29,769
or on the skeletons. It has to be 59. It does 10 every time. I'm staying where I am. Defend.

377
00:52:33,909 --> 00:52:41,260
It's not great range, but it's enough. That's bad. Oh fuck. Okay. Hold on. Oh, the hobbits are

378
00:52:41,260 --> 00:52:52,460
ranged. I don't have any, I can't do any of those spells. Who's priority right now?

379
00:52:55,960 --> 00:53:10,150
Probably the whites. Look at the damage. Not bad. All right. Should I, should I just throw like these

380
00:53:10,150 --> 00:53:17,800
fucking green onions up here? Should I just make the green onions go forward first?

381
00:53:22,889 --> 00:53:35,989
Okay. Here we go. Oh God. That hurts. That hurts. No, not a good opportunity. They have good attack,

382
00:53:35,989 --> 00:53:50,699
but I don't want to just throw them up there. They'll get hurt. Stay here. Defend. Spell. Defend.

383
00:53:50,699 --> 00:54:00,260
Good opportunity here. Good. Oh, oh no. They're getting closer. They're getting closer. Um,

384
00:54:01,530 --> 00:54:11,190
it's all right. The green onions are dead. Four. Oh, it's getting close. Here we go.

385
00:54:12,230 --> 00:54:19,159
Should I go for the whites or should I go for the skeletons? I think I got to go for the whites,

386
00:54:19,639 --> 00:54:29,260
but there's so many more skeletons though. Get in there. Oh, oh no. He's creeping up.

387
00:54:29,260 --> 00:54:38,789
Come on. Let's go naked guy. I'm thinking Harpy's defense. Damage one to four.

388
00:54:39,750 --> 00:54:53,510
Damage one to three. I got to whittle down the skeletons. They're 28. I'm going for the whites.

389
00:55:01,079 --> 00:55:05,559
That's a great power to have. Come on. I'm going to try. Maybe I should back you up.

390
00:55:09,239 --> 00:55:17,500
I think I'm going to go back. Yes! All right. Move the hobbits. They need to stay alive.

391
00:55:21,739 --> 00:55:27,340
Uh, we're going to have, okay, we're going to have to have naked guy versus half naked guy.

392
00:55:28,139 --> 00:55:48,300
Ah, they do a lot of damage. All right. Here we go. Should I? I think, I think it's time to

393
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:56,699
sacrifice you. I'm going to fly down here. I don't have any spell points. I'm out of mana.

394
00:55:58,139 --> 00:56:22,650
Out of mana. 24. 20. I can't really run. Just, uh oh. Keep fighting over here. He's a pretty good

395
00:56:22,650 --> 00:56:36,789
tank. Okay. Here we go. Ready? 10 skeletons left. Eight. Four. Yes! This is a victory here. This is

396
00:56:36,789 --> 00:56:51,860
a good victory. Um, I can't go that far. Let's get it closer so I can do it next time. The enemy,

397
00:56:51,860 --> 00:57:09,860
no, the enemy's fled. He ran away with one guy. Okay. Where did he, where did he flee? No, he's

398
00:57:09,860 --> 00:57:22,309
dead. He literally disintegrated. Yeah, he's dead. He's gone. He abandoned the cause. Okay,

399
00:57:22,309 --> 00:57:30,460
because I didn't kill him. I win. Good fight. Good victory. You all deserve a raise. Spell scroll.

400
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:34,920
Just as you bend to pick up the old parchment, you hear something move behind you.

401
00:57:35,860 --> 00:57:39,780
Turning around, you notice some marksmen in the trees. You are not really sure why,

402
00:57:39,780 --> 00:57:42,500
but you get the feeling that if you pick up the parchment, they will attack.

403
00:57:43,829 --> 00:57:52,489
Do you want to pick up the parchment? I don't, not after fighting all that. I don't have enough,

404
00:57:53,130 --> 00:58:14,920
it'll still be there. No, it'll be there. I, I, I, uh, we're gonna, I, no. What do we got over here?

405
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:20,679
So we've got this already. A pack of stone goblins. I got a pretty decent crew, right?

406
00:58:27,980 --> 00:58:36,300
Damage four to five. Damage three. Damage two to three. These guys are slow and they can't move

407
00:58:36,300 --> 00:58:57,900
very far. Shield everybody up. Well, not yet. Hold on. None of them are ranged. I mean,

408
00:58:57,900 --> 00:59:11,699
this thing actually is pretty strong. Should I run? The cowardly Nimbus flees from battle.

409
00:59:13,590 --> 00:59:18,119
What? Whoa, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Hold on. Wait a minute. Is he dead?

410
00:59:21,500 --> 01:00:02,860
Where is he? I, I didn't know that's what happened. It's been a while. I didn't know

411
01:00:02,860 --> 01:00:10,329
that when you retreat, they just delete themselves. Okay, so I'm not going to fight you. A pack of

412
01:00:10,329 --> 01:00:17,610
gogs. I don't know if I can do that either. Would you like to recruit gremlins? 16 gremlins join

413
01:00:17,610 --> 01:00:23,750
your army. Nice. And there's a chest here. After scouring the area, you fall upon a hidden chest

414
01:00:23,750 --> 01:00:30,679
containing the ancient artifact Mystic Orb of Mana. What is that? This orb helps you recover

415
01:00:30,679 --> 01:00:42,900
three extra spell points per day. Nice. Pretty nice. Although I can't get this stuff, unfortunately.

416
01:00:43,460 --> 01:00:54,099
I kind of need to just go down to the other. I'm too, I'm too weak to do any of that. All right,

417
01:00:54,099 --> 01:01:04,570
we got it. I think I can do citadels, right? In City Hall. 2,000 extra gold per day. Do it.

418
01:01:04,570 --> 01:01:20,300
5,000. Bingo. Our growth has increased. The capital building is the new one. Pretty nice,

419
01:01:20,300 --> 01:01:28,780
although I'm out of resources though. This can also be done. No, I need a blacksmith. I don't

420
01:01:28,780 --> 01:01:46,780
have enough wood, but I think I'm just going to trade for it with one of my like pots because I

421
01:01:46,780 --> 01:01:57,530
want to be able to do this stuff next week. Blacksmith. I need to deck this place out.

422
01:02:00,150 --> 01:02:07,349
New turn. Weirdly enough, I've only seen that one person. Aren't there like four or five people

423
01:02:07,349 --> 01:02:18,170
on this map? 60 halflings in there. I'm just gonna head down here. I'm gonna have to use

424
01:02:18,170 --> 01:02:24,969
that whole day to do this though. All right, almost done with the first week almost.

425
01:02:25,690 --> 01:02:33,429
Which brings us to here. I don't think I can get over here. There's just that.

426
01:02:33,429 --> 01:02:39,429
Red Keymaster's tent is being guarded by a pack of Gorgons. They're probably really strong though.

427
01:02:44,139 --> 01:02:50,219
PvP versus viewers. I don't have the new version. This is the old GOG version. There's no

428
01:02:50,219 --> 01:02:57,619
multiplayer. It's unfortunate because the new version is kind of all fucked up and

429
01:02:57,619 --> 01:03:02,340
messed up in a lot of places. The new, the old version is way better, but doesn't have

430
01:03:02,980 --> 01:03:09,369
like multiplayer capabilities. But wait, the good old, the GOG one does it. Isn't it like land?

431
01:03:13,639 --> 01:03:24,579
Sea Chest. Where's my spell book? Should I get in the boat? No, no, no, I need it. Okay,

432
01:03:24,579 --> 01:03:31,219
we're almost done with the first week. I can recruit some people. Well, yeah, not, not yet,

433
01:03:31,219 --> 01:03:35,659
not yet. That's a pretty good idea, but hold on. I, I don't have any money for anything.

434
01:03:36,300 --> 01:03:44,840
I could do the Citadel here. Resource silo. Citadel. I'm just gonna run out of money.

435
01:03:46,840 --> 01:04:02,389
I probably should Citadel this. Stone. No, give me this. Nine per week. I'll get eight. I'll get

436
01:04:02,389 --> 01:04:14,469
more. Four thousand gold. Looks all right. Okay, let's go over here. Portal of Summoning. I don't

437
01:04:14,469 --> 01:04:20,710
know what that means. The Harpy Loft allows you to recruit Harpy Hags. So what do I have? I have

438
01:04:20,710 --> 01:04:25,190
these, uh, these Harpies, regular Harpies. I can upgrade the Harpies and then we get new, better

439
01:04:25,190 --> 01:04:36,360
ones next week. I'm going for it. There they are. Harpy Hags and regular Harpies. Two different

440
01:04:36,360 --> 01:04:49,849
versions. Damage one to four. Attack six six, six five. And these are much faster. Strike and return

441
01:04:49,849 --> 01:04:54,940
and no enemy retaliation on the upgraded ones. That's pretty good. All right, we'll see it next

442
01:04:54,940 --> 01:05:07,429
week. First week is about to be complete. I don't have anything else I can do. Astrologers proclaim

443
01:05:07,429 --> 01:05:14,170
week of the Condor. All dwellings increase population. All right, let's take a look at what

444
01:05:14,170 --> 01:05:24,360
that does. Nice. So we've got a lot of options here. I've got 6,000 gold. Should I just pull

445
01:05:24,360 --> 01:05:38,170
everybody? 3750 for 18 Gargoyles, 17 Comedy Gremlins, and six Naked Guys. I think that's

446
01:05:38,170 --> 01:05:54,059
pretty good. Recruit them all. You guys can stay there for now. Let's go over here. Let's recruit

447
01:05:54,059 --> 01:06:07,239
all here. I don't fucking have any money. I need to, oh shit. I need to, okay, I gotta go.

448
01:06:08,500 --> 01:06:31,940
Let's fill, fill that up. Come here. Ah, damn it. I, ah. No, it's gotta, this is a pretty decent team

449
01:06:31,940 --> 01:06:50,250
so far. 44, nine, 18, six and six. These guys are strong. These guys are strong. So now, shouldn't,

450
01:06:50,250 --> 01:07:00,599
can I do this? Uh, I have to spend, yeah, I might as well just do it. So now I have better Harpies

451
01:07:00,599 --> 01:07:07,420
here. No, just, you sit around for a minute until I get a little bit more money. Because I'm gonna

452
01:07:07,420 --> 01:07:15,000
have you go into the ocean. You've got enough troops where you're, of course, to be reckoned

453
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:24,179
with here. We got, uh, Witch Hut. This will have to be next week. I don't have any money to do

454
01:07:24,179 --> 01:07:32,380
anything so let's keep going. What? It didn't take too long for you to realize that people will not

455
01:07:32,380 --> 01:07:37,980
bow down to a new god as easily as you might like. Fine. You tell yourself, if it's a war they want,

456
01:07:37,980 --> 01:07:45,420
it's a war they're going to get. Who did I say that to? Witch's Hut.

457
01:07:46,809 --> 01:07:50,489
An ancient witch living in a strange hut welcomes you, teaching you offense for her own

458
01:07:50,489 --> 01:07:59,940
indestructible purposes. I learned basic offense. Thanks. Increases all hand-to-hand damage

459
01:07:59,940 --> 01:08:15,860
inflicted by the hero's troops by 10 percent. In, what did I say? No Marauders. You really need to

460
01:08:15,860 --> 01:08:28,170
get these. I got a lot of troops. 20 spell points. I think I can take them. The no more

461
01:08:28,170 --> 01:08:33,529
marauders awed by the power of your forces begin to scatter. Do you wish to pursue and engage them?

462
01:08:33,529 --> 01:08:47,720
Let them run. In awe at the, of in awe at the absolute size of this unit. Two wood a day. That's

463
01:08:47,720 --> 01:09:04,250
good. I need it. Money or Mr. Experience. Nice. Level three. Expert Necromancy or buyer magic.

464
01:09:05,050 --> 01:09:08,329
Expert Necromancy allows 30 percent of the creatures killed in combat to be brought back

465
01:09:08,329 --> 01:09:13,750
from the dead as skeletons. I mean this, why would I do anything else at this point?

466
01:09:13,750 --> 01:09:24,970
This is the like the Resurrector. Okay cool. I don't think I want to do anything else. I want

467
01:09:24,970 --> 01:09:33,880
to do a boat with you. How much money do I have now? All right I can do this. I don't, I want to

468
01:09:33,880 --> 01:09:49,449
do upgraded tags. So if I pull everybody, these hags? Yes they are. Okay. Recruit them. Get them all.

469
01:09:51,930 --> 01:09:58,439
All right. Wait before it snow. I don't have any more money but I want to summon the boat over here.

470
01:09:59,399 --> 01:10:17,500
How do I summon the boat? Where's my spell book? That's one thing I do. There it is. Cast a spell.

471
01:10:17,500 --> 01:10:25,029
Summon boat. That spell costs eight spell points. We have six. God damn it. I only have six points?

472
01:10:29,029 --> 01:10:32,949
Well you can just, you hang out here and just take care of the castle for a while.

473
01:10:39,220 --> 01:10:46,500
Next day. What do I have for, all right so we're going down this way. Hutter the Magi.

474
01:10:47,140 --> 01:10:51,539
You enter a rickety hut and talk to the magician who lives there. He tells you a place near and

475
01:10:51,539 --> 01:11:04,170
far which may aid you in your journey. Oh shit. Oh shit. Look at that. Look at these things. Bears.

476
01:11:04,489 --> 01:11:11,399
The coliseum. He's just revealing everything for us. Look at this dude. Holy fuck. Thanks man. All

477
01:11:11,399 --> 01:11:27,050
right so let's see. Where am I now? I am right here. So if we go down there is, we got a shipyard.

478
01:11:27,689 --> 01:11:35,939
A lot of stuff. There's some wraiths. There's a gem factory. Golem factory. Subterranean rocks.

479
01:11:35,939 --> 01:11:44,680
There's a little ship out here. There's the eye. Let's just go down here first. Actually this is

480
01:11:44,680 --> 01:11:54,229
like the top. Let me see. There's another castle over here. Let me just see what it is. What is

481
01:11:54,229 --> 01:12:03,899
this? University. Your hero's footsteps echo through the quiet halls of this ancient university.

482
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:10,520
A clerk informs you that while here your hero may receive instruction on the following subjects.

483
01:12:11,479 --> 01:12:20,090
Offense. Logistics. Learning. First aid. You cannot learn first aid. This will cost 2,000 gold.

484
01:12:20,090 --> 01:12:24,970
Basic logistics. Increase your hero's movement points over land so you get to move 10% more

485
01:12:24,970 --> 01:12:42,550
each turn. Or basic learning. 5% more experience. But it's also all my money. 10% more movement per

486
01:12:42,550 --> 01:12:57,539
turn or 5% more overall experience. Tuition for learning basic logistics is 2,000 gold. Let's do

487
01:12:57,619 --> 01:13:12,729
it. Hey, um, why don't I just do them both? No, not free. Should I do them both? Oh, I can't. Right,

488
01:13:12,729 --> 01:13:17,930
okay. I thought it was already in real time updating that. Well, okay, I can move more.

489
01:13:18,569 --> 01:13:32,489
I couldn't really build anything in 1,000 gold. How many spell points do I have? What do you have

490
01:13:32,489 --> 01:13:40,920
for spell points? Eight. All right, let's go. It's time. Cast the boat. We're getting that chest in

491
01:13:40,920 --> 01:14:03,989
the middle of the ocean. Boat. What? Oh, it's a 50% chance. Well, go back to bed. Get some sleep.

492
01:14:05,699 --> 01:14:20,409
We'll try again tomorrow. Uh-oh. That guy just killed somebody. Where's that person? I think

493
01:14:20,409 --> 01:14:27,159
they're on a different continent. All right, things are getting interesting. Take a nap and

494
01:14:27,159 --> 01:14:35,479
go again. All right, so there we go. We got War Machine Factory. Oh, damn. Recruit Ballistas.

495
01:14:37,189 --> 01:14:52,500
Ah, they're so expensive, but they're so powerful. Give me one. Can I not do it? No, I can do it.

496
01:14:52,500 --> 01:15:12,579
Look at this shit. I want like a ton of these. Worth it. I'm taking the money. Den of Thieves,

497
01:15:12,579 --> 01:15:21,020
or do I go up to the Harpy Hags? Look at that. A pack of Silver Pegasi. Protecting a gold mine.

498
01:15:21,979 --> 01:15:31,960
Let's go this way. Den of Thieves. Oh, this just tells you about...

499
01:15:40,119 --> 01:15:52,970
So here we go. Number of towns. Oh, shit. Artifacts. Kingdom. Army. Income.

500
01:15:53,930 --> 01:16:08,250
So I'm the green flag, right? Best hero. Personality. Human. What is that? Is that a goat?

501
01:16:09,130 --> 01:16:14,250
Best monster is my Beholders. This is cool, though, because it can show you just how...

502
01:16:15,210 --> 01:16:24,489
That's interesting. All right, so we know how to be careful. A pack of mummies.

503
01:16:25,289 --> 01:16:36,409
And a sulfur. There's a Coliseum here. Arena. Thousand experience. I'll take it. Thanks for

504
01:16:36,409 --> 01:16:47,850
1000 HP. That's all we can do for now. All right, how's the other guy doing? Two spell points. It's

505
01:16:47,850 --> 01:16:54,420
not... You know what? Fuck it. We got places to be. Just... I want that sea chest. So bad.

506
01:16:57,060 --> 01:17:06,619
Ugh. Somebody right here. No, it's me. Go for the cow. I don't know if I can do it. Oh no,

507
01:17:06,619 --> 01:17:12,090
I can go for the... I'll go for the scroll. Okay, here we go. I've got a decent army here. I've got,

508
01:17:12,090 --> 01:17:16,869
like, pretty good hags. You get the feeling that if you pick up this parchment, they're going to

509
01:17:16,869 --> 01:17:42,470
attack. Oh my god. What have I done? Uh, this is impossible. I won't be this... Must be something

510
01:17:42,470 --> 01:18:15,989
pretty good, yeah. Um... Retreat, but... But I'm gonna lose everybody anyways. Everybody hide.

511
01:18:15,989 --> 01:18:25,060
These guys are magicians. They're gonna fucking kill everybody. No, I'm not setting the frogs

512
01:18:25,060 --> 01:18:43,340
out. I'm gonna see if this is even doable. I don't have any fucking spell points. Uh...

513
01:18:44,779 --> 01:18:51,510
This is... That's a... Guys, these guys have crossbows. This guy's dead. Dude, he just is.

514
01:18:52,680 --> 01:19:01,220
And I could retreat and then redo, but it's over. Might as well try to take as many out as I can.

515
01:19:05,220 --> 01:19:17,000
I'm gonna stay back here though. Oh, this is bad. Very bad. I didn't even kill one of them.

516
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:42,409
Pop its attention. Send out the frogs. No, I like these guys. At least... Let's try to take a piece

517
01:19:42,409 --> 01:20:22,020
off before we go down. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. No rewind. I'm not gonna save, scum. That was an

518
01:20:22,020 --> 01:20:28,659
outcome that... I went for the item. I went for the spell scroll and it was like, hey, be careful.

519
01:20:29,619 --> 01:20:37,399
And I got fucking wrecked. That's just the way it is. It's okay. It's all right. It's okay. This is

520
01:20:37,399 --> 01:20:42,779
the guy. This is the guy that's level like three. He knows what he's doing. He's got a great military

521
01:20:42,779 --> 01:20:47,619
here of undead creatures. He's got more spell points. This guy's way better. All right, I'll

522
01:20:47,619 --> 01:20:56,300
get a new one. We'll get a better hero. For instance. Like, take a look. Ready? Uh, where's

523
01:20:56,300 --> 01:21:08,869
the tavern? Yeah, I mean, already I like these two more. This is a death knight. Or should we get

524
01:21:08,869 --> 01:21:27,050
this guy? Thane or Volkiel? I'm going with Thane. All right. Alchemist. Wait, don't we already have

525
01:21:27,050 --> 01:21:39,899
an alchemist? We know we did. Thane. I mean, I kind of need Thane. But death knight is like...

526
01:21:39,899 --> 01:21:46,310
Let's just wait. Let's compare them. So death knight starts with... Okay, hold on. So death

527
01:21:46,310 --> 01:21:53,689
knight starts with the skeletons and the the wraiths. This is necromancy and artillery.

528
01:21:53,689 --> 01:22:01,909
Specializes in vampires. Okay. This is gargoyles and gremlins. Is an advanced scholar. Has a bunch

529
01:22:01,909 --> 01:22:10,630
of points and specializes in genies. Hmm. This is a scholar. We have a necromancer already.

530
01:22:11,189 --> 01:22:30,859
I'm going to go with the genie. You hang out there for a while. You're gonna have two? Yeah,

531
01:22:31,100 --> 01:22:34,380
I know. I just want to spread it out a little bit. Don't bite off more than I can chew.

532
01:22:35,260 --> 01:22:41,619
They're starting... We're starting to get to the stage where people are starting to move around.

533
01:22:41,619 --> 01:22:54,600
Oh! No! They have a terrible... They have a shit army though. This army sucks. This army sucks.

534
01:22:55,239 --> 01:23:04,840
What do I kill first? These guys are terrible. I can't even attack the skeletons.

535
01:23:09,699 --> 01:23:20,979
I can't... I can't go that far. Okay. Skeletons. You're not going to get in here. This is an

536
01:23:20,979 --> 01:23:24,180
impenetrable fort. You're not getting in. I'll kill you all before you get in here.

537
01:23:24,899 --> 01:23:39,000
Good thing we took the magician. Oh boy, they can... They can fucking throw in here. Oh fuck.

538
01:23:42,949 --> 01:24:02,470
Oh no, they can get in here. Oh, eat shit. We're fine. Everything's fine. Yes! Just stay behind

539
01:24:02,470 --> 01:24:20,899
the walls. Ow! All right, get in there and then get out. Whoa! What? Wait, what happened? Why did

540
01:24:20,899 --> 01:24:34,649
he die? He landed in the pit. That's not fair. He got boiled in the oil.

541
01:24:48,680 --> 01:25:03,020
Shit. I just bought you. You would take 2,500 gold. Do not apply... I have to... I can't just

542
01:25:03,100 --> 01:25:16,949
redo every battle. You can't just redo every single time. It was dumb. Yeah, but now I learned.

543
01:25:16,949 --> 01:25:22,760
Don't worry. I'll get it back. Guys, don't worry. I'll get it back. That was a dumb mistake.

544
01:25:24,890 --> 01:25:34,409
Rewind? Was it dumb? Is that a fucking mistake?

545
01:25:38,550 --> 01:25:41,989
All right, let's go. All right, it's the only time I'm going to rewind in the whole day.

546
01:25:42,550 --> 01:25:59,270
I promise. Just don't land in boiling oil. All right, kill this motherfucker. All right,

547
01:25:59,270 --> 01:26:10,819
everyone can just defend. Defend, defend. Take him out. I've got my Medusa archers.

548
01:26:11,539 --> 01:26:26,119
Do not let him in here. All right, everybody defend. I'm gonna lose the gremlins. Are you

549
01:26:26,119 --> 01:26:42,550
gonna burn in the oil? You can't get in here, can you? I'm not doing that. Ow. Oh fuck. They

550
01:26:42,550 --> 01:26:57,880
have to die now. Yes. Thane received 722 experience. We have pushed them back. The

551
01:26:57,880 --> 01:27:10,329
person is collecting all my stuff. That person is taking all the things that I want. A pack of

552
01:27:10,329 --> 01:27:29,210
mummies. Add some sulfur. Mine. Save the game. Okay. I wonder if a pack of mummies will be able

553
01:27:29,210 --> 01:27:38,699
to take me on. This is a pretty good crew here. I mean, like, really? What do they got? Nothing.

554
01:27:39,659 --> 01:27:46,390
I think they're ranged, though. No, they're not ranged. All right. Good to know.

555
01:27:47,430 --> 01:27:54,810
Move the gremlins forward. I don't think I need to cast any spells here.

556
01:27:55,770 --> 01:28:07,180
They have Curse. I forget what Curse does. I'll have a homeless second here. Stone skin,

557
01:28:07,180 --> 01:28:18,729
shield, magic arrow. Just lame it out in the corner. Let's try magic arrow on you. Holy shit.

558
01:28:19,449 --> 01:28:40,199
Okay. These guys are pretty tough. Skeletons, move in. Butchers. Butchers, move in. Naked guys,

559
01:28:40,199 --> 01:28:51,189
move in. I wanted more of these. All right, here we go. I'm gonna get a little bounce back here.

560
01:28:52,149 --> 01:29:07,100
Get it. Oof. It's all right. We're doing fine. Right in front of you. In fact, stone skin,

561
01:29:08,060 --> 01:29:18,420
defense, shield. Hmm. Which one's better? They both do the same kind of thing, right? Dispel.

562
01:29:21,380 --> 01:29:43,050
Slow. We'll do stone skin. Yeah, we're fine. Move in. We got three more. Uh-oh.

563
01:29:43,930 --> 01:29:54,250
Cursed? Yeah, he's cursed. Oh, they're both cursed. What does the curse do, though? Cursed duration

564
01:29:54,250 --> 01:30:01,430
three rounds. Spells affecting the army. What does it do? I think we'll be fine. It's one down.

565
01:30:02,149 --> 01:30:15,640
Skeletons coming up from the back. And butchers coming up from the left. Okay, we're good. Level

566
01:30:15,640 --> 01:30:26,020
four. Advanced eagle eye or water magic. Spell power plus one. Advanced eagle eye gives your

567
01:30:26,020 --> 01:30:34,340
hero a 50% chance to learn any spell up to third level used in combat. Or allows your hero to cast

568
01:30:34,340 --> 01:30:43,380
water spells at a reduced cost. 50% chance to learn any spell up to third level. What does that mean?

569
01:30:46,329 --> 01:30:54,729
I mean, maybe we should just try it. All right, one soul for a day is not going to come from here.

570
01:30:55,289 --> 01:31:10,300
Let me see. What does that, what does that do? Spell. It's just all learn from the enemy here.

571
01:31:10,300 --> 01:31:15,640
Okay, I see. That's interesting. That's pretty cool. All right, what do I want to do now?

572
01:31:16,600 --> 01:31:30,140
I have this. Let's see. 35, 33, 15, 6, 6. Pack of wood elves. I don't have any range, though.

573
01:31:31,100 --> 01:31:37,560
I think I'm going to avoid them for now. Yeah, I'll avoid them for now. Let's get the chest.

574
01:31:38,279 --> 01:31:45,699
Experience. Level up. That's all right. Get the crystals. Idle of fortune.

575
01:31:46,420 --> 01:31:52,710
It's awesome. I can't, I don't think I can go here unless these are dead. Is Stain still alive?

576
01:31:52,710 --> 01:31:58,859
Yes. All right, Thane. Just hang out there for now. I'm going to recruit the frogs.

577
01:31:59,659 --> 01:32:14,859
Okay, I don't think I can do much. Nobody to recruit. Go on. That guy's in a boat.

578
01:32:14,859 --> 01:32:30,310
Where they're getting a lot of stuff done on their turns. Pack of nomads. I'm so timid. Idle

579
01:32:30,310 --> 01:32:36,180
of fortune. You found an ancient and weathered stone. Idle. Kissing it is supposed to bring

580
01:32:36,180 --> 01:32:47,500
luck or happiness. So you do. This stone is very cold. Got more morale. Gems. Silver wing tower.

581
01:32:47,500 --> 01:33:03,350
There's nobody here. Shit's fucking empty. I'll take it. It's empty. All right, let's

582
01:33:03,350 --> 01:33:16,899
gonna relax here. And you got gremlins. I'll take them. I got 59 gremlins. This is an actual

583
01:33:16,899 --> 01:33:26,010
empty town though. I already have a fort. 2000 gold per day. I could have just a huge income.

584
01:33:29,140 --> 01:33:38,869
Marketplace. Go for it. Get a marketplace up here. Hang out in there for now. 4000 gold.

585
01:33:42,979 --> 01:33:54,819
Mage guild one scholar. Okay, hold on a minute. Allows you to recruit evil eyes. Yes. Oh damn.

586
01:33:54,819 --> 01:34:01,369
Okay, what's the difference? Beholders evil eyes. So beholder is just that. This is no melee penalty.

587
01:34:02,819 --> 01:34:09,859
10 attack, 8 defense. Just better. Shoots 24 shots. 3 to 5. 3 to 5 health. It's just better

588
01:34:09,859 --> 01:34:28,760
in every way. Eyes for days. I have upgrades here. All right, looking good. Citadel. Let's go for it.

589
01:34:31,979 --> 01:34:44,039
More growth. Now I gotta relax. You gotta upgrade the gremlins? Yeah, I'm...

590
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,800
Yeah, I know. You're right. Hold on. I'm scared that something bad's gonna happen.

591
01:34:48,439 --> 01:34:52,460
Look at this person getting all the fucking stuff in the ocean. That's what I wanted to do.

592
01:34:53,590 --> 01:35:18,659
No. What do I got? 4600 workshop. Master gremlins. Okay, here we go. They're just like

593
01:35:18,739 --> 01:35:28,100
Fantasia monsters. All right, so this is 3344. Oh, they're ranged. They can be ranged. Okay,

594
01:35:28,100 --> 01:35:35,189
damage one to two. Yeah, these are better. I gotta upgrade. I gotta bring people in here.

595
01:35:35,189 --> 01:35:42,199
Who has all the gremlins? You do. You have a lot of these just like shitty gremlins.

596
01:35:44,619 --> 01:35:51,369
Blacksmith. Let's get that city hall up. Only visiting heroes may use the blacksmith.

597
01:35:51,369 --> 01:35:55,819
I can't like use that? I guess I don't have anything to use it. All right, what else? Anything

598
01:35:55,819 --> 01:36:11,100
else in here? Upgrade the warren. Infernal frogs. Oh, okay. Immune to blinding. Okay,

599
01:36:11,100 --> 01:36:15,260
so they attack five four. They're just better. One to three. Health. Have more health.

600
01:36:16,060 --> 01:36:21,369
So they turn from green onions into like Triceratops or Stegosaurus or whatever.

601
01:36:22,329 --> 01:36:38,100
Okay, that looks good. Good luck. Increased attack. So we got some upgraded frogs.

602
01:36:39,060 --> 01:36:47,079
Now, I need to start moving around. You have such shit. You have such bad,

603
01:36:49,260 --> 01:36:56,100
you I could move around though. We have to, we have to do something. I gotta get some,

604
01:36:56,100 --> 01:37:01,510
I gotta move around here. At least one of these things. Let's go to the windmill.

605
01:37:03,989 --> 01:37:11,819
Three gems. We're in the windmill. Okay. Lots of sin to our captains. I'm too afraid to

606
01:37:12,060 --> 01:37:26,359
pursue. Packing nomads. I think I could take them. Let's go. All right, this is a lot though.

607
01:37:26,359 --> 01:37:34,310
These guys are fucking strong, aren't they? I mean, kind of, kind of, but it's all right.

608
01:37:35,189 --> 01:37:47,399
All right, we're good. Defend here. I don't want to just give them a free hit. I don't think they

609
01:37:47,399 --> 01:37:54,170
can make it. They're not going to make it. He's not going to make it. Wait for them. This guy

610
01:37:54,170 --> 01:38:11,850
though will be here in time. He will make it. Just get up there. Nice. There you go. There you go.

611
01:38:11,850 --> 01:38:17,859
There you go. There you go. There you go. Not going to make it. He made it. Blocked. Holy shit.

612
01:38:17,859 --> 01:38:25,220
You fucking hero. What an absolute fucking monster of a unit. No, he's all right. He's all right.

613
01:38:25,859 --> 01:38:33,220
All right. What we got? Gargoyles. Let's go down here. There's only three down here. Bang.

614
01:38:33,220 --> 01:38:50,649
Bang. Crap around the side. Yeah, we're good. We're good. This is not that bad. I can't believe

615
01:38:50,649 --> 01:39:01,079
that didn't kill you. You really want to get rid of the gremlins, huh? Yeah, that's it. Say what?

616
01:39:02,659 --> 01:39:13,260
Okay. I was scared for that for some reason. 420 experience. That'll give us the one crystal a day.

617
01:39:14,460 --> 01:39:20,199
Pack of wood elves. I should be able to take them as well. I still have plenty of points. I got

618
01:39:20,199 --> 01:39:26,340
plenty of people. I should be able to get these wood elves, but they've ranged. That's the only

619
01:39:26,340 --> 01:39:31,779
thing that concerns me. No, let's just park it right here. I need like to get the other hero going,

620
01:39:32,500 --> 01:39:42,380
but he just, you can't do any exploring with this group of fucking idiots. Is uh,

621
01:39:42,380 --> 01:39:57,880
necromancy automatic? I think it is. Let's keep going. Oh no. Again? They're going to take it.

622
01:39:57,880 --> 01:40:30,569
Again? Not again. What do we got here? Whose ranged? The whites. Oh man. Ah man. I can't get

623
01:40:30,569 --> 01:40:37,750
over there. I have just the towers, but he's going to cast spells and kill the violet.

624
01:40:38,390 --> 01:41:02,939
I have such a small crew. This is bad. Uh, not good. Very bad. Very bad. Very bad. Very bad. Very bad.

625
01:41:02,939 --> 01:41:14,119
Very bad. Very bad. It's over. It's over. Yeah. I just have to accept the defeat here.

626
01:41:17,720 --> 01:41:22,039
He's going to just shoot. Oh, he's going to shoot through every time. How much, how many

627
01:41:22,039 --> 01:41:38,460
spell points does he have? Yeah, I'm dead. Yeah, that's it. Game over. Oh, it was my like younger

628
01:41:38,460 --> 01:41:50,659
brother, Thane. Came to attack Thane's. Thane came to get Thane's stuff. Thane versus Thane.

629
01:41:50,659 --> 01:42:02,539
Astrologers proclaim week of the badger. All dwellings have increased population.

630
01:42:02,539 --> 01:42:10,890
That's why we need to like, ah, this is going to have to be our real stronghold.

631
01:42:11,609 --> 01:42:21,979
I spread myself a little too thin here. All right. What about this? This is a good place. Let's

632
01:42:22,539 --> 01:42:32,170
really upgrade this stuff. Obsidian gargoyles, iron golems, can recruit mages. How much is this?

633
01:42:32,890 --> 01:42:48,680
Let's get some mages and 1800 recruit everybody. No, not yet. Not yet. Mages are damn good.

634
01:42:48,920 --> 01:42:53,180
But I'm not going to get them yet because I have to upgrade these guys. Let's get at least the

635
01:42:53,180 --> 01:43:02,329
mages. Yeah, these guys are awesome. And let's pull up the gremlins because we already have,

636
01:43:03,130 --> 01:43:08,810
obviously, the upgrade there. Get them all. That's all I can afford.

637
01:43:12,649 --> 01:43:18,970
Fuck, I'm out of money. They're going to attack the city from the portal.

638
01:43:20,140 --> 01:43:34,140
Fuck, they're going to come for that town next week from this portal. I've got four wizards

639
01:43:34,140 --> 01:43:38,140
protecting it. I don't have any money. I should have fucking taken the money before in the

640
01:43:38,140 --> 01:43:47,739
beginning. I've got to start to fucking cash in something here. I have to try to make something

641
01:43:47,739 --> 01:43:54,890
happen. Do you wish to pursue him? No, let him run. I want to go into the arena. You enter the arena

642
01:43:54,890 --> 01:44:00,329
and face a pack of vicious lions. You handily defeat them to the wild cheers of the crowd.

643
01:44:00,329 --> 01:44:05,050
Impressed by your skill, the age trainer of gladiators agrees to train you in a skill of

644
01:44:05,050 --> 01:44:10,520
your choice, plus two attack or plus two defense. This could be the run saver right here.

645
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:22,659
Attack. That's pretty damn good. Oh, there's defense. I don't have any.

646
01:44:23,539 --> 01:44:33,449
Okay, that was good. That was good. I need a hero. Lots of harpy hags, lots of centaur captains.

647
01:44:34,170 --> 01:44:47,189
The university is over here. The war machine factory. I don't know. A pack of silver pegasi.

648
01:44:47,189 --> 01:44:53,020
Can I get them? I might be able to kill them. Don't come attack me, please. Don't come attack

649
01:44:53,020 --> 01:45:31,029
me. Don't come. What happened? What? Where was that? It was a scripted event. It was just a

650
01:45:31,029 --> 01:45:39,750
scenario event. I had to pay like somebody robbed me taxes. Oh, that was actual taxes. I needed that

651
01:45:39,750 --> 01:45:47,609
money this week, this day. So bad. Fuck. Okay, well, here we go. I would have just bought another one

652
01:45:47,609 --> 01:45:59,479
of these. I need the money. I need the money. I need the money. I have to recruit people.

653
01:46:09,739 --> 01:46:18,729
Lots of, no, not lots of Harpies. Let's get the gold. 600 temple. Got some luck. All right. More

654
01:46:18,729 --> 01:46:32,359
gold and a pack of silver pegasi during like Christmas or something. This is bad. I can't do

655
01:46:32,359 --> 01:46:44,630
it. What about the harpy hags? I might be able to get the Harpies. There's an obelisk right here.

656
01:46:45,270 --> 01:47:06,979
I'm not sure what I want to do here. Lots of harpy hags. No. I'm fucked. I'm so fucked. I just need

657
01:47:06,979 --> 01:47:19,260
to just dial up the defense. Recruit. No, not yet. Hold on. Obsidian gargoyles. There we go. All

658
01:47:19,260 --> 01:47:31,850
right. Pull them in. Let's see the difference. Speed. They're just faster. Okay. Now how much

659
01:47:31,850 --> 01:47:47,939
money do I got? 13. Recruit as many as I can. I have 1300. Come on. Recruit. Wait, what?

660
01:47:49,000 --> 01:48:00,060
Oh, okay. I can't afford it. I have to at least have something here. I have 30 gold. Fuck. I'm

661
01:48:00,060 --> 01:48:10,119
in so much trouble. Why do they have to take all my money? I was just getting ready. Guys like

662
01:48:10,119 --> 01:48:23,739
sailing the seven goddamn seas. Okay. 3000. Recruit everybody. There we go. I have now the

663
01:48:23,739 --> 01:48:35,239
obsidian gargoyles, a bunch of magic remlins. This is at least protected. This one-way portal

664
01:48:35,239 --> 01:48:48,140
is an awful danger. Can I close it? Can I close this portal? This guy? Okay. Should I just go fuck

665
01:48:48,140 --> 01:49:08,659
this guy up? Lots of skeletons. Lots of frogs. I'm going to buy a new hero and we're going to storm

666
01:49:08,659 --> 01:49:18,119
the castle and I'm going to take it back. I need somebody in here though. Look at that picture.

667
01:49:18,760 --> 01:49:23,159
Level one knight or level one wizard? I think that's the first thing I'm doing.

668
01:49:23,960 --> 01:49:31,939
Don't go in that portal. He's looking at it. I can tell. Go up there and- go up there and get

669
01:49:31,939 --> 01:49:37,210
your ass kicked. Go take that squirrel and die. Please go up there. He doesn't know.

670
01:49:42,680 --> 01:49:53,079
What's over here? I can go over here and go down. Let's go to the imp cache. This has been- have I

671
01:49:53,079 --> 01:49:59,619
visited this yet? I don't think so. Don't come in here. Don't go in the portal. Don't go in the

672
01:49:59,619 --> 01:50:13,159
portal. Oh. Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Somebody else came. Oh god. Purple just came up

673
01:50:13,159 --> 01:50:18,199
and just murdered him. Go up there and die. He's going to go touch it. What do you have?

674
01:50:18,920 --> 01:50:29,289
He's got like treants and griffins and mutants and- oh no. Okay. Take the castle now. Take the

675
01:50:29,289 --> 01:50:42,220
castle now. All right. Here we go. Ready? Let's get level one genie. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah.

676
01:50:42,859 --> 01:50:47,340
Oh yeah. Upgrade him. We're going to get the castle. We're gonna just put the walls up.

677
01:50:47,340 --> 01:51:04,699
Okay. We need to upgrade these guys. Oh Jesus, man. 64 of them. Stone garg upgrade. Dude. All

678
01:51:04,699 --> 01:51:19,100
right. I'm ready. Let's go. Let's go get the castle. Well, there's nobody in it. There's nobody in here.

679
01:51:19,100 --> 01:51:43,130
It's mine. Sucker. Hey, thanks for the fucking upgrades. You dummy. You're not going to get

680
01:51:43,130 --> 01:51:46,729
over here. Yeah. I don't have- how do I get money? But hold on. How do I- can I-

681
01:51:47,449 --> 01:51:52,739
I'm going to exchange something because I need- I need money. Hold on. I got a lot of-

682
01:51:53,220 --> 01:52:08,039
Uh, hold on. This is important. I need castle. I need 5,000 gold. How do I get five grand

683
01:52:08,039 --> 01:52:24,710
right now? Go to the market. I want- no, no. I want this. What do I get for this? Okay. I

684
01:52:24,710 --> 01:52:28,069
can do it. I can do it. I can do it. Hold on. What's the- what's the best one? What's the most

685
01:52:28,069 --> 01:52:40,520
expensive? Gems? 100. 50. 100. 100. They're all 100. Okay. I think I could get rid of

686
01:52:41,319 --> 01:52:57,350
some pots. Sell the red crayons. 10. I don't think I need mercury for anything right now.

687
01:52:58,149 --> 01:53:08,819
I need to get to 5,000. I need wood. What about the- okay, what about sulfur? I could do 10

688
01:53:08,819 --> 01:53:22,869
sulfur, 10 pots, 10 ore, which is 3,000. I'm going for it. I have to. Selective blindness.

689
01:53:23,960 --> 01:53:42,949
I did it. Okay. We're gonna do- I don't have enough wood. Wait. What do you mean? I fucking

690
01:53:42,949 --> 01:53:51,909
need 10 wood. Wait before- hold on. Before I go any further. Hold on, Ed. Wait, wait, wait, wait,

691
01:53:51,909 --> 01:54:01,210
important. Oh! Eat shit game. Eat shit game. Eat shit game. I'm gonna win this. I'm gonna- I'm

692
01:54:01,210 --> 01:54:17,609
gonna hold the castle. All right. What's more important? Restore spell points with the gems

693
01:54:18,409 --> 01:54:22,890
and the- can I get the gem factory? No, not yet. I'm gonna go to the imp cache.

694
01:54:24,810 --> 01:54:33,590
You found an imp cache. Do you wish to attack the guards? The portal near your base is one way.

695
01:54:42,119 --> 01:54:47,510
Where- they're out. Okay, this is a different scenario here. Hold on. They're just weak. It's

696
01:54:47,510 --> 01:55:00,949
okay. I'm gonna go for bottom right. Bottom left. Yeah, I'll win this. It's a lot of imps, but

697
01:55:01,029 --> 01:55:05,829
they're not- they're not strong enough. You just got to go twice. That was bullshit.

698
01:55:10,699 --> 01:55:18,970
No, they ain't gonna win. The retaliation alone. Let me see here. Magic arrow. Let's just try to

699
01:55:18,970 --> 01:55:29,050
just melt one of these. I'm gonna just melt the guy over here. Absolutely melt it. Okay, just

700
01:55:29,050 --> 01:55:36,020
attack the thing right next to you. Should kill it. Things weak as hell. Skeletons go down here.

701
01:55:36,500 --> 01:55:46,739
I better get something good for this. I don't need to waste my magic here. Yeah, gargoyles.

702
01:55:46,739 --> 01:56:03,189
Yeah, same thing down here. Skeletons are really good. I can't wait to upgrade them.

703
01:56:04,069 --> 01:56:24,859
Right here. Just move over here. Drop them. Come on. Get this one up. Hopefully there's a bunch of

704
01:56:24,859 --> 01:56:38,100
money in here because that was actually to solve every problem I have. Dude, they're doing so good.

705
01:56:38,180 --> 01:56:50,460
Doing so good. Gremlins are doing really good. All right. 800 experience. 200 imps dead. All right.

706
01:56:50,460 --> 01:57:00,710
Lost some people, but it's okay. All right. Level five necromancer. Expert eagle eye or basic wisdom.

707
01:57:00,710 --> 01:57:11,260
I learned attack plus one. That's good. 60% chance to learn any spell up to fourth level used in

708
01:57:11,260 --> 01:57:17,989
combat. Or I can actually learn third level spells. That's, yeah, that's better.

709
01:57:19,239 --> 01:57:26,779
Having defeated the imps, you discover four mercury and two thousand gold. I have done it.

710
01:57:27,340 --> 01:57:40,500
I've done it. Got it. I've done it. Good. I still need wood. Is there any wood down here?

711
01:57:41,060 --> 01:57:53,050
Oh, it's like a shipyard. There's no wood though. Well, let me just, I can visit this once a day

712
01:57:53,050 --> 01:57:56,890
anyways. So I might as well just, I don't think I can do anything else. Shrine of magic gesture.

713
01:57:57,529 --> 01:58:08,300
Remove obstacle. I just learned. Nice. Okay. Cool. Very cool. Very cool. All right. But this

714
01:58:08,300 --> 01:58:11,100
lumber here, somebody's right outside the door. I gotta remember that. It's important to remember.

715
01:58:11,100 --> 01:58:17,340
Okay. Wait, wait. Which door? So this is a one way entrance. So that person can't even get over here,

716
01:58:17,979 --> 01:58:36,420
but they can go here. So I need to build. I need 10 wood. I noticed. Yeah, no, I know that. I've read

717
01:58:36,420 --> 01:58:41,260
it in the chat a few times. No, I know. I knew that. I knew that like 20, 15, 20 minutes ago.

718
01:58:41,739 --> 01:58:51,989
Yeah, I know. I didn't know that before that, but no, I read. I read that. I did. I'm concerned.

719
01:58:52,869 --> 01:59:02,010
We both went through it. So no one's, there's nobody going to live through this. This scenario

720
01:59:02,010 --> 01:59:07,699
here is no one is going, no one's going to live through this. Like I have to get on the boat.

721
01:59:09,539 --> 01:59:24,550
So it's either take it or don't. I need wood. I need wood. I'm willing to spend.

722
01:59:25,930 --> 01:59:35,380
What am I willing to spend? That's the best. It's just three. I could give some sulfur. I need how

723
01:59:35,380 --> 02:00:00,340
much? I need 10. I could do six sulfur. I could do nine. I need one more. We could do gems. Okay.

724
02:00:03,100 --> 02:00:26,340
I will now have two arrow towers, fortified defenses and doubled growth. Bring it on.

725
02:00:26,340 --> 02:00:38,810
Just hang out in here. Don't move. Save the game. That's a good idea. Okay. I'm fucking nervous

726
02:00:38,810 --> 02:00:44,840
because I can't like, that's really nice of you to build that for the purple guy just to take it.

727
02:00:45,560 --> 02:00:55,850
I still have a couple of cities. I'm going to piss my pants. I'll be right back. Two minutes.

728
02:02:35,340 --> 02:03:23,430
Here we go. All right. So I've got no money. I've got defenses. I've got a very large amount of

729
02:03:23,430 --> 02:03:37,590
people that are going to try to come kill me. This does not bode well. Let's go. There you go. Bring

730
02:03:37,590 --> 02:03:44,949
it on. Or go up top of the spell book and get killed. Here we go. Okay. 160 fucking eight. Look

731
02:03:44,949 --> 02:03:50,149
at that. I got, they shot three times. All right. I got an opportunity. Here we go. All right. Let

732
02:03:50,149 --> 02:03:55,460
me think about this for a second. I just dropped all their hobbits are gone immediately. Chained

733
02:03:55,460 --> 02:04:13,479
lightning. Chained lightning strikes four units. Will this bounce around? If I do it right here,

734
02:04:13,479 --> 02:04:30,859
is this going to be catastrophic? What do I start it on? Are we over here? Oh, that's not very good.

735
02:04:31,420 --> 02:04:39,699
Oh, that's not very good. Oh, that's not very good. Defend. I can't do anything with you unless

736
02:04:39,699 --> 02:04:50,539
somebody gets closer. Ah, okay. I got to kill these archers, but it's not going to be good.

737
02:04:51,420 --> 02:05:03,399
There's so many centaurs. I think I have to go for the centaurs.

738
02:05:04,760 --> 02:05:17,340
Mm. No, I got to go for you. The oil could get them. That's not a whole lot. It's not doing a

739
02:05:17,340 --> 02:05:36,229
lot of damage. 27. Fuck. Oh, come on. Fire it. Kill them. They're getting in. They got in. They got

740
02:05:36,229 --> 02:05:46,340
in. They got in. They got in. Quick. Go this way. What do I do? She got in. Spells. Stone skin.

741
02:05:48,760 --> 02:06:02,069
Stone skin. Stone skin. Get in there. Oh, I'm dead. Oh, we're dead. This is very bad.

742
02:06:05,819 --> 02:06:17,029
17. I got to kill the immediate threat. Kill the immediate threat. Come on. They can't get in yet.

743
02:06:18,630 --> 02:06:42,220
15. Oh, shit. This is so bad. I'm dead. It's game over. That's it. They got, they breached. The

744
02:06:42,220 --> 02:06:50,100
Pegasus breached. There's not much else I can do. I mean, I get to spell. No, I don't have any

745
02:06:50,100 --> 02:07:00,149
points. I don't have any points left. We just die. Maybe next time. It's not over yet, but it will be

746
02:07:00,149 --> 02:07:13,960
very soon. We just have to try to kill the Pegasus. My only hope is sincerely that the archers on top

747
02:07:13,960 --> 02:07:26,520
will do a lot of damage here. Don't surrender. Just get up here. I got three archers. They're

748
02:07:26,520 --> 02:07:43,050
going in the mud. They only have 12. Dammit. Not good. Now they're outlandish. Bad. One hit.

749
02:07:43,850 --> 02:07:56,970
One hit kill. 149. Instantly kill. Oh, no. That's it. I got nothing left. I got nothing left.

750
02:07:58,949 --> 02:08:21,989
Oh, fuck. Oh, well. I tried. All I got is you. 5,000 gold. Gone. It's not over. It's not over.

751
02:08:22,710 --> 02:08:36,279
I still have a bustling city here. Not over. This thing. I just have this for the fucking

752
02:08:36,279 --> 02:08:56,550
gold at this point. I need a mage tower level one. I need money. It's not over. It's not over.

753
02:08:57,109 --> 02:09:09,800
There's still plenty of possibilities. I'm going to try to get over here. I'm just going to refill

754
02:09:09,800 --> 02:09:21,189
my points. There's like a pack of dwarves. I can get rid of them. Would you look at that?

755
02:09:21,189 --> 02:09:25,270
A group of battle dwarves with a desire for greater glory wish to join you. Yes, I accept.

756
02:09:28,739 --> 02:09:44,180
Well, that could have just potentially changed everything. 7, 12, 7, 22 health. Shipyard. Boat.

757
02:09:44,739 --> 02:09:54,010
All right. Things are looking up. There's nobody in this area, right? Better not be. No, it's just

758
02:09:54,010 --> 02:10:02,119
me. Changed everything again. Summon boat. That was the different character. I don't have that

759
02:10:02,119 --> 02:10:11,220
ability. Holy fuck. I can summon boat. I thought that was a different character. It's this guy.

760
02:10:11,220 --> 02:10:16,579
This is the guy that has the boat ability. All right. I know what I'm doing. Here we go. Don't

761
02:10:16,579 --> 02:10:26,779
kill me. There's somebody dangerously close to where I am. All right. Get the gold. Lots of

762
02:10:26,779 --> 02:10:39,130
walking dead. And then a golem factory. Don't pursue. Golem factory. Much to your dismay,

763
02:10:39,130 --> 02:10:44,899
the golem factory is guarded by a pack of gold golems. Do you wish to fight the guards?

764
02:10:50,819 --> 02:10:57,510
I don't think that's wise. That would be very unwise. Give me the boat. I have 20 points.

765
02:10:58,390 --> 02:11:09,340
Summon boat. God damn it. Do it again. Summon a boat. I got heads twice.

766
02:11:10,300 --> 02:11:16,789
Fuck. This strange eye turns and studies you as you approach. After a few moments,

767
02:11:16,789 --> 02:11:21,430
it returns to its slow scan of the area. You can't help it feel like someone or something

768
02:11:21,430 --> 02:11:32,010
is using the eye to spy from another location. There's a shipwreck survivor right here.

769
02:11:33,210 --> 02:11:38,699
Come on. I got to get over here. Look at all this. There's so much stuff untapped potential

770
02:11:38,699 --> 02:11:57,020
over here. I need that fucking boat. Now. All right. I've got some money. Resource silo. More

771
02:11:57,020 --> 02:12:10,250
gems. Increase obsidian and gargoyle production by four. Wall of knowledge. Let's get it. Yeah.

772
02:12:10,250 --> 02:12:23,189
More growth. Better troops. Don't kill me, please. I give up on this one. All right. You know what?

773
02:12:23,189 --> 02:12:26,630
This one. How many? How much is it? No, not even worth it. You can just have them if you take it.

774
02:12:27,350 --> 02:12:39,020
There's nothing here. This place sucks. This is the one that I don't care about. I already

775
02:12:39,020 --> 02:12:47,340
took all this shit, but this is going to get cleaned. This motherfucker's just sailing the

776
02:12:47,340 --> 02:13:04,409
seven seas. I can't afford a boat. How can I not afford a boat? I have $9,000. Wood?

777
02:13:07,819 --> 02:13:17,430
But okay, so riddle me this. Does summon boat. Summons an existing, friendly, unoccupied boat.

778
02:13:18,569 --> 02:13:25,460
Oh god damn it. I need to have, I need to have a boat first. How much is a boat?

779
02:13:26,340 --> 02:13:46,810
How much is a boat? I need a castle. $5,010.10. I'm building a castle. I need to get to this

780
02:13:46,810 --> 02:13:57,590
capital. $4,000 gold a day. I need to, I just need things. Where's the market? What do I need?

781
02:14:02,779 --> 02:14:15,369
It's so much and not worth it. Terrible exchange rate. Six, seven, eight, nine, ten, four.

782
02:14:16,250 --> 02:14:42,460
I need to, I need to start upgrading. Bad. Two more. Sell some of my bitcoins?

783
02:14:43,340 --> 02:14:50,489
Oh, what do you mean? They, I don't have any of these. Two more wood. I'm going to just take it

784
02:14:50,489 --> 02:14:58,420
from here. No, I'm not. I'm just depleting my resources. These are so necessary. All right.

785
02:14:59,739 --> 02:15:06,579
Castle. Adds two arrow towers. Fortifies town defenses, doubles creature growth. Build it.

786
02:15:07,850 --> 02:15:22,819
I can now, $10,000 for a capital building. I need a lumber mill. I need wood. I need a lumber mill.

787
02:15:22,819 --> 02:15:36,140
This is what, that's it. This gives me like one wood a day. Where is there a lumber mill? I need

788
02:15:36,140 --> 02:15:44,180
that fucking boat. I think I'm going to go attack this guy. Over this guy. Lots of gogs. Pack of

789
02:15:44,180 --> 02:15:52,569
stone golems. I'm starting to go in the goblin factory. What do you think? Should I try to do

790
02:15:52,569 --> 02:16:07,750
this? Wow. Whoever green is, he sucks. If I just did the, I didn't, I don't know how much it is for

791
02:16:07,750 --> 02:16:21,739
a boat. Is it ten wood? I'm giving myself a restart point because if this is just horrible,

792
02:16:21,739 --> 02:16:33,959
then I'm just restarting again. Go. Fuck, okay. So it's, this won't be, I don't think this will be

793
02:16:33,959 --> 02:16:50,790
horrible. Shield. Magic arrow. Who's more dangerous here? Down here. I can't reach it though.

794
02:16:51,270 --> 02:17:11,739
Oh, he's magic immune? Oh shit! I, uh, they're both magic immune. Whatever, it's fine. What do I have

795
02:17:11,739 --> 02:17:21,100
right now? Gargoyle. How far can they walk? They can walk kind of far. I do have the dwarves.

796
02:17:21,659 --> 02:17:30,620
All right, dwarves are going in the bottom. Not enough. Good. Okay. I have no range. I have hue

797
02:17:30,620 --> 02:17:40,069
though. Uh, you defend. You also defend. No, go up like a little bit. You go down here to back up

798
02:17:40,069 --> 02:17:53,899
the dwarves. Nice shot. All right. Gargoyle time. Stay here. Nice. Okay. Dwarves. This is where you

799
02:17:53,899 --> 02:18:38,010
wanted to join a better cause. Pretty good tank. Stay with it. No! Good. Just, I gotta go for it.

800
02:18:39,690 --> 02:18:44,709
Five. Go for the one that's damaged.

801
02:18:44,709 --> 02:19:02,420
Get the skeletons down here. There's 50 of these guys. You're next in line. In fact, you wrap around

802
02:19:02,420 --> 02:19:15,399
here. Four left. Oh, there they go. There they go. There they go. They fought for glory. Bring in the

803
02:19:15,399 --> 02:19:34,420
skeletons. 49 versus four. Big damage here. Very good. And I mean very good. Nice. You're just trying

804
02:19:34,420 --> 02:19:43,370
to take a plate space at this point. Gargoyles are dead here. Good. That's what I wanted you to do.

805
02:19:44,010 --> 02:19:58,379
All right. Bring in the gremlins from top left. Kill this. Done. All right. It's almost impossible

806
02:19:58,379 --> 02:20:13,129
for me to lose this. This better be worth it. Surrounded by all sides. Six. Go this way. 49

807
02:20:13,129 --> 02:20:22,409
skeletons. This thing is so strong. Imagine having like more than 20 of these. It'd be

808
02:20:22,409 --> 02:20:42,520
unbeatable. Almost, gremlins are almost dead. Thank god. 810 experience. The golem factory is

809
02:20:42,520 --> 02:20:54,120
now no longer defended. Oh. Oh. My god. Okay. How much money do I have? Fruit, iron, golem.

810
02:20:54,680 --> 02:21:04,010
I can bring in a bunch. Bring them all in. Can I, how much can I have? This is diamond golems.

811
02:21:04,010 --> 02:21:13,299
I definitely want at least two of these. Diamond. Gold golems. Just how many, okay I got one more

812
02:21:13,299 --> 02:21:25,700
slot. No actually I don't. I, because these are stone. I can get them all. At least, okay I can

813
02:21:25,700 --> 02:21:37,290
fill it up. That's good. Two diamond. Three gold. Seven stone now. I spent all my money. That's okay.

814
02:21:45,670 --> 02:22:01,530
These guys are so tough. Now I can go up here and get this now. For sure. Guaranteed. Now it's time

815
02:22:01,530 --> 02:22:09,000
to save for a boat and hope I don't get attacked. I don't like where that guy's going. I don't like

816
02:22:09,000 --> 02:22:17,579
the boats that you're on. Astrologist proclaim week of the wyvern monarch. Wyvern monarch growth

817
02:22:17,579 --> 02:22:28,120
plus five. Well I don't have those. Lots of people to recruit but I don't have the money.

818
02:22:28,920 --> 02:22:42,809
I could get another hero. No don't do that. I need money. I need wood. Save the game. Looks good so

819
02:22:42,809 --> 02:23:19,290
far. Lots of rates. I have a great team here. I mean I'm going hard. Let's go. Oh fuck you.

820
02:23:21,260 --> 02:23:35,750
Fucking goddamn taxes again. I'm broke still. Go on. Come on over here. You ain't got nothing.

821
02:23:39,159 --> 02:23:47,260
Um I don't think you can make it. I'm gonna defend. Maybe actually defend with most everybody. Let's

822
02:23:47,260 --> 02:23:54,739
put you guys out there. Put the skeletons out here too. Uh yeah because I don't want to lose any of

823
02:23:54,739 --> 02:24:12,229
these guys. I want them to be incredibly safe. Drains enemy mana. Let's see if I can do something

824
02:24:12,229 --> 02:24:20,579
here. Be slow. Let's see if this works. Not bad. Uh defend. I don't want them going out there.

825
02:24:21,459 --> 02:24:33,209
It's okay. This is pretty good so far. All right we've got diamond. Diamond go and I this might

826
02:24:33,209 --> 02:24:46,489
be a one hit kill. Not really but it was still pretty good. Yeah I have just these slow moving

827
02:24:46,489 --> 02:24:52,170
assholes. The skeletons are the best. They just truly are. Look at this. They're so good.

828
02:24:53,049 --> 02:25:08,520
Don't hit the diamond. Thank you. Only lost a few skeletons. Here we go. Knowledge plus one.

829
02:25:08,520 --> 02:25:13,079
Basic resistance. Basic resistance endows a hero's troops with five percent magic resistance.

830
02:25:14,200 --> 02:25:28,440
Yeah take it. Here we go. Now I get some good. What is this? One a day. Well I could probably

831
02:25:28,440 --> 02:25:41,989
do this now. Although let me get the points. It's 30. What are we doing? All the taxes took

832
02:25:41,989 --> 02:25:57,579
all my money so I can't do anything. We got this. The imp cash. I've got 3500. We're gonna go up

833
02:25:59,610 --> 02:26:16,540
to just the warm machine factory. The Harpies. I think I can take them. Or the cent. No.

834
02:26:17,579 --> 02:26:23,860
Let me take a look at the map because I need to start to move out somewhere. I own that stuff.

835
02:26:27,930 --> 02:26:32,569
I really just I need. What about up here? Pack of stone golems. Okay I can do this.

836
02:26:32,569 --> 02:26:43,500
I can get up here. We can get the this stuff here. Yeah move up here. This is the good old

837
02:26:43,500 --> 02:26:49,450
games version. This is not the HD remaster. This is the good old games version with the community

838
02:26:49,450 --> 02:27:03,620
HD patch. I need 10 000 gold to do that. I don't have that yet unfortunately. Oh that stuff he's

839
02:27:03,620 --> 02:27:14,760
getting. I need to get out there. The tomb. Did not go to the windmill yet. Take the three.

840
02:27:16,280 --> 02:27:26,729
Uh this is the rally flag. I can grab this. Walking morale up. Might as well touch it.

841
02:27:27,530 --> 02:27:41,690
Okay I'm ready. A pack of golems. I have a pack of golems too. Let's go. They're just clearing all

842
02:27:41,690 --> 02:27:59,639
the... I'm dead. Pack of stone golems. Nine and nine. I mean I'm gonna win. I'm gonna keep the

843
02:27:59,719 --> 02:28:17,700
skeletons back here. I really want to just have... I want to attack first so then everybody defend.

844
02:28:18,420 --> 02:28:23,030
Yeah I don't want to I don't want to be the one that gets hit. Let them come to us

845
02:28:25,350 --> 02:28:33,540
like that. All right you are gonna go... Let's just overwhelm this one. Overwhelm this guy with

846
02:28:33,540 --> 02:28:52,680
everybody. He's running away. He's going down here. Overwhelm. You stay back. Uh oh not good.

847
02:28:52,680 --> 02:29:15,940
You gotta... We gotta get up there. Fuck. You go up there. Lock. Get rid of this one.

848
02:29:17,319 --> 02:29:26,469
Three versus... There we go. We should do it. One more. Fuck. He's come with my skeletons. I know he

849
02:29:26,469 --> 02:29:37,829
is. Why am I holding back the skeletons? Because I can... If I if I don't lose any skeletons I can

850
02:29:37,829 --> 02:29:45,219
have like a hundred of them. Remember anytime one point is ticked off there's a chance that it adds

851
02:29:45,219 --> 02:29:59,500
to my skeleton stack. So I mean I'm just I'm going like skeletons. We're good. Actually probably

852
02:29:59,500 --> 02:30:09,299
good to get. No not worth it. So I have 49 now. I only lost three people. I should maybe have some

853
02:30:09,299 --> 02:30:20,180
more. Let's see what I got now. 53 skeletons now. Alchemist's lab. I've already visited this.

854
02:30:21,930 --> 02:30:27,860
Bingo. I now have one of those a day and then there's something... Artifact. What is it? Gog.

855
02:30:28,579 --> 02:30:41,110
Got some gremlins. Is it gog? Scary. I don't know if I can fight this. I don't know what a gog is.

856
02:30:49,530 --> 02:31:00,329
They're ranged. Lots of gogs. I do. Resource silo. Lookout tower.

857
02:31:02,229 --> 02:31:11,350
Alter bushes. Genies. Genies or capital building? Genies.

858
02:31:15,180 --> 02:31:23,739
Okay capital. I'll have a decent amount to recruit after this. I don't want to... I can't... I don't

859
02:31:23,739 --> 02:31:42,379
want to waste money here. Get one city ready to go. He's coming. No. This guy's clear. That orange

860
02:31:42,379 --> 02:31:48,170
is clearing out. Oh fuck. He got in a boat. He got in a boat. This guy got in a boat. Where's he

861
02:31:48,170 --> 02:31:57,780
going? He could go down here and then... Oh no he's in a boat. He finally got one. He's gonna go down

862
02:31:57,780 --> 02:32:08,100
and he's gonna come over here and he's gonna meet me over here. I'm fucked. Okay I gotta be ready

863
02:32:08,100 --> 02:32:26,299
for this. Is it worth trying to get this artifact? I have some decent army. Let's go. This is not

864
02:32:26,299 --> 02:32:46,840
that... there's only 11 of them. Yeah they're weak. Get up there. Checkmate in five turns. No we got

865
02:32:46,840 --> 02:33:03,670
this. I'm gonna... I'm just gonna move the skeletons up there anyways. Ballista. Nice. Yeah it is.

866
02:33:04,549 --> 02:33:18,010
Hopefully that that artifact I'm hoping is a uh a table turner if you know what I mean. Go this way.

867
02:33:18,010 --> 02:33:36,229
One hit kill. Not quite. Almost a one hit kill. Good job. You can just sit here. Nice. Lost a couple

868
02:33:36,229 --> 02:33:49,819
of skeletons but that's all right. There it is. Cape of Velocity. What does it do? Warn about the

869
02:33:49,819 --> 02:34:01,370
shoulders. This cape increases the combat speed of all your units by plus two. I mean it's all right.

870
02:34:01,370 --> 02:34:08,540
That's okay. That's pretty good. I can move more. That's good. Backpack. I don't have any backpack.

871
02:34:09,579 --> 02:34:29,430
Nothing else up here. I'm delaying the inevitable. Here we go. Capital. Chris your kingdom to 4,000

872
02:34:29,430 --> 02:34:43,610
gold a day. It's done. Now I need to upgrade. Uh this has already been done. This has already

873
02:34:43,610 --> 02:34:51,659
been done. I need to do the Golem Factory. Do that another time. Speaking of Golem Factories,

874
02:34:53,159 --> 02:35:05,139
I want to go back to the Golem Factory and hopefully I'll have 10 by then. I'll have 10

875
02:35:05,139 --> 02:35:12,040
by then. Because I'm scared of the guy on the damn boat. I don't know where he's gonna go.

876
02:35:20,549 --> 02:35:30,459
It's so scary. Someone's gonna be waiting for me down here.

877
02:35:31,260 --> 02:35:34,809
This is so close. Look at how close he is. He's in the boat right there.

878
02:35:36,540 --> 02:35:51,559
Uh 10. I have 10. I'm not gonna be able to make it. Not even close. Castle. Taravan. Wall of Nod.

879
02:35:51,559 --> 02:36:02,549
Lookout Tower. Resource silo. One gem. Golden Pavilion. Or the genies. Genies or the uh nagas.

880
02:36:04,010 --> 02:36:09,059
Probably nagas. They're the ultimate unit. No no no. Giants are the ultimate unit.

881
02:36:09,059 --> 02:36:31,219
We'll go genie. Okay genie now available. 13 to 16 damage. That's pretty good. They're available.

882
02:36:32,969 --> 02:36:38,950
I've got 10 wood. Don't worry I know I just spent five but trust me it's gonna take me at least

883
02:36:38,950 --> 02:36:48,469
like four or five days to even get down here. If we get a new week we'll have a ton of people.

884
02:36:49,110 --> 02:37:07,700
All right I'm ready. Here we go. He's going down to the islands.

885
02:37:07,700 --> 02:37:13,270
Fuck. He's gonna get all this shit before I am. All dwellings increase population again.

886
02:37:15,959 --> 02:37:27,639
Come on. Give me to the boat. I'm so close. What do I got? I have so many people to recruit. How

887
02:37:27,639 --> 02:37:42,889
much is it? 95 80. I have so many recruits. Save the money. I'm gonna just get barely down here.

888
02:37:43,860 --> 02:37:57,799
This guy's gonna take all the cool shit. Let's go. That's all I can do. Just don't go to this

889
02:37:57,799 --> 02:38:06,700
cool island. I want to go to the island. He's on the island. Oh he's on the island right now.

890
02:38:07,340 --> 02:38:15,909
They're scooping up fucking taxes. Wow. Why? What the fuck? What? They took all my wood. I had

891
02:38:17,270 --> 02:38:46,760
you took all my wood. Damn it. I'm so disappointed right now. I gotta go for it. I have to.

892
02:38:58,069 --> 02:39:17,139
This is too much money. I'm not using gold. Yeah but this is every cent I have. Just to get seven

893
02:39:17,139 --> 02:40:04,040
I can get one two three. Give me the boat now. Boat please. That's it. It was only a thousand.

894
02:40:04,040 --> 02:40:09,239
Give me a boat. Get in the boat. We're in the boat. Boys and girls we've made it. We're gonna go rescue

895
02:40:09,239 --> 02:40:30,819
this person. I have no more turn points. He don't come over here. Oh he's on the island. That's my

896
02:40:30,819 --> 02:40:40,469
island. That's my island survivor. I've been looking forward to this. You pulled a shipwreck

897
02:40:40,469 --> 02:40:45,670
survivor from certain death in an unforgiving ocean. Grateful he rewards you for your act of

898
02:40:45,670 --> 02:41:00,229
kindness by giving you the crown of the supreme magi. While on your head this item increases your

899
02:41:00,229 --> 02:41:21,750
knowledge by plus four. That's a lot of points. 70 spell points. Favorable winds. Rock. Chip.

900
02:41:22,629 --> 02:41:29,829
Where do I go? But he's on here too. What does he have? Stryker the death knight. What do you got?

901
02:41:31,340 --> 02:41:35,420
Oh he's dead. He's fucking dead. Look at this shit. He's got nothing. He's so depleted. Let's go get

902
02:41:35,420 --> 02:41:49,690
him. This dude is fucked. He's got nothing. He has like three zombies. Stay here. I have no more. I

903
02:41:49,690 --> 02:41:59,690
got him. Don't leave here. There he goes. There he goes. He's right here. Did he get it? No. Where is

904
02:41:59,690 --> 02:42:15,899
he? Where did this motherfucker go? Is he inside? That's his boat right there. He knows I'm coming

905
02:42:15,899 --> 02:42:33,430
for him. Coming for you. Hey is that uh your boat back here? Oh fancy seeing you here. Oh so you're

906
02:42:33,430 --> 02:42:49,530
gonna go in that? There's a bunch of uh orcs in there. You're dead. Bye. The mistake was taking

907
02:42:49,530 --> 02:42:56,100
this. Do you see how many times this castle has changed hands? Like five times at least. This is

908
02:42:56,100 --> 02:43:16,760
just a dead zone here. I will kill you. You have one person? This must... I mean this is a scout.

909
02:43:17,860 --> 02:43:32,440
This is just a scout. Yeah. You've captured an enemy artifact. Endless bag of gold and bow of

910
02:43:32,440 --> 02:43:46,379
elven cherry wood. It took like 15 grand. When equipped the endless bag of gold increases your income by

911
02:43:46,379 --> 02:43:56,020
750 a day. This bow increases your archery by five percent. What a mistake that was. That guy is

912
02:43:56,020 --> 02:44:03,540
fucking dead. All right. I don't know if I want to do attack this yet and I got a boat too. So I got

913
02:44:03,540 --> 02:44:15,719
money. Very important. Let me take this place over. This place. Wait what's in here? Oh boy. He's on

914
02:44:15,719 --> 02:44:34,059
his way over here. This guy's dangerous. Um look at this shit. There's stuff back here. Red border

915
02:44:34,059 --> 02:44:50,629
gate. There's like a troll bridge. I probably need to just get on the boat and get out of here. Let

916
02:44:50,629 --> 02:44:54,569
me just go to the arena. There's nothing else down here. I'm not going to go in here.

917
02:44:56,409 --> 02:45:09,059
Ding dong. That's two attack. I think I need defense. I have zero defense guys. It's very

918
02:45:09,059 --> 02:45:20,889
necessary. Give me the shipyard. Mine. He's not going to be able to move. He's going to anchor up

919
02:45:20,889 --> 02:45:31,399
here and he's going to be stuck. So I got an opportunity. I can leave. Why did I do that?

920
02:45:31,399 --> 02:45:37,799
Because he can't move when he lands. I'm getting in there and I'm getting the gold.

921
02:45:38,440 --> 02:45:45,610
Okay. Artifacts. Merchants. For a nominal fee you can purchase artifacts from the merchants.

922
02:45:46,649 --> 02:45:57,700
Lookout tower. Super genies. Yeah. Upgraded genies. Master genie and recruit genies. What's the

923
02:45:57,700 --> 02:46:10,579
difference? Hates effreet. Spellcaster. Random benefit. Pretty good. This is still uncontested

924
02:46:10,579 --> 02:46:21,049
somehow. All right. He's gonna he's not gonna have enough points to do anything. Here he comes in

925
02:46:21,049 --> 02:46:28,459
the boat again. He's going all he's going around. See he might take this castle but okay do I have

926
02:46:28,459 --> 02:46:40,780
enough? He's not coming for me I don't think. I think I can get in there and get out. Where's the

927
02:46:40,780 --> 02:46:51,129
boat? What happened to the boat that was right here? I can get in and get out. He summoned the

928
02:46:51,129 --> 02:46:57,370
boat. Oh fuck. No I know my boat's right here but like he's he must have summoned it back.

929
02:47:03,989 --> 02:47:08,069
Summon it? Should I summon it from him? No but I can get in this one. I'm going for it. Fuck it.

930
02:47:12,469 --> 02:47:18,139
I can't let you pass. You should seek a key master tent. Like that? What about the troll bridge?

931
02:47:18,780 --> 02:47:25,579
Much to your dismay the troll bridge is guarded by several trolls. Do you want to fight?

932
02:47:26,700 --> 02:47:37,290
No. No. Go back to my like war machine factory. I'm gonna recruit more golems. No I am not going

933
02:47:37,290 --> 02:47:49,430
for it. All right it's time to get another hero. Wizard or necromancer. I kind of want like a knight.

934
02:47:50,069 --> 02:48:05,559
Especially hypnotize. Animate dead. Just have two necromancers? Yeah. Level three. Wait who the

935
02:48:05,559 --> 02:48:17,940
fuck is this person? What? Wait. Phant? Wasn't this guy an enemy? Oh he's a deserter. He deserted.

936
02:48:20,520 --> 02:48:30,389
That's so funny. He deserted and we hired him. No loyalty at all. Holy shit. All right do you think

937
02:48:30,389 --> 02:48:37,979
I should just deck him out with all my money? Fuck yeah. I'm gonna spend every set of golems.

938
02:48:41,959 --> 02:48:46,760
He's pretty fucking strong though. All right like we can't just have one hero.

939
02:48:46,760 --> 02:48:59,479
This guy has a lot. The master genies. These are really good. I'm okay with this. No where's uh

940
02:48:59,479 --> 02:49:11,829
where's he? He's got the glyph of gallantry. We're out by one. He has the first aid tent. Heals

941
02:49:11,829 --> 02:49:20,260
everybody in each round. Okay what does he have for spells? Summon boat. Great. Animate dead.

942
02:49:21,479 --> 02:49:40,940
Increased effect of animate dead. Okay I'm gonna keep him here for now. Let's move on. I need to

943
02:49:40,940 --> 02:49:48,920
go check out the golems. Oh there he is. Did he fight? Okay he had to fight. This is empty.

944
02:49:49,719 --> 02:49:56,489
Dude I don't know. I'm not doing that again. He's getting so much more money though.

945
02:49:57,129 --> 02:50:03,059
I'm not gonna fall for it. He did it like the same thing to this guy.

946
02:50:03,940 --> 02:50:07,459
Let him take on the trolls. Let him fight everything and then I'm gonna clean him up.

947
02:50:13,100 --> 02:50:21,139
10 wood. Nice. Hold on a minute. Wait wait wait wait wait. Is there anything else over here?

948
02:50:22,020 --> 02:50:29,959
Freelancer's guild. There's a bunch of stuff down here. Dwarven treasury.

949
02:50:33,829 --> 02:50:46,219
Anchor up first. I got a turn. All right what do we got? Library. Uh upgraded golem factory.

950
02:50:47,620 --> 02:50:57,420
Or it's time to get. Yeah this guy is gonna. This is the best unit I can make. Get him both.

951
02:51:10,739 --> 02:51:22,889
This person is really ready to go. I could upgrade it too. Hopefully the person doesn't fall. Go

952
02:51:22,889 --> 02:51:33,659
fight the trolls in the bridge. No. All dwellings increase population. We get a condor. 5,000. What

953
02:51:33,659 --> 02:51:41,750
do we got? I can get a couple of these. I can get. Yeah let's just get the ones. Let's recruit

954
02:51:41,750 --> 02:51:56,100
more golems. All right. I feel pretty safe. I'm gonna get back in that boat and I'm gonna

955
02:51:56,100 --> 02:52:03,700
explore over here. I feel safe. Get more. I mean I just want to just sit here

956
02:52:04,500 --> 02:52:22,309
and farm them. Farm these guys. All right let's go. Farm golems for 10 straight turns. I feel like

957
02:52:22,309 --> 02:52:37,909
I'm gonna lose something. War taxes. No it's only it's per week. It's not every day. It's every week.

958
02:52:39,989 --> 02:52:47,879
Sorry. Unfortunately guys. I'm gonna go exploring. I'm gonna go down here. Or should I fight the

959
02:52:47,879 --> 02:53:14,629
trolls? Queens. Oh man. I can make naga queens. I can make it fully upgraded. I just can't afford

960
02:53:14,629 --> 02:53:31,979
it right this second. Let's go. He's gonna be right in my way. Uncharted territory. Hold on a minute here.

961
02:53:32,459 --> 02:53:49,299
Dead. Boat-to-boat combat. 28. You ain't got nothing. Get on over there. Walk the plank.

962
02:53:49,860 --> 02:54:21,190
They're gonna have to do the same thing. Ow. He ran away. He wasn't gonna deal with that. He

963
02:54:21,190 --> 02:54:41,239
abandoned his post. Goodbye. Cowards. Coward. So what is over here? A lot of uncharted territory.

964
02:54:41,239 --> 02:54:48,299
What about up there? Should I check this? Oh there's a shipwreck. Let's check this out.

965
02:54:48,299 --> 02:55:03,879
Shipwreck. Let's check it. Resource silo. Let's upgrade some stuff. This is the best thing that I can make.

966
02:55:09,239 --> 02:55:14,219
I'm bringing in so many people. I'm just spending so much money. I've got so many people.

967
02:55:15,260 --> 02:55:22,120
I'm going to win. The turtle wins the race. Did you see the end of that movie?

968
02:55:34,680 --> 02:55:38,680
Pirate ship creaks eerily as it's pushed against rocks. Do you wish to search the shipwreck?

969
02:55:39,479 --> 02:56:06,600
Yes. Morale down. Search it, yeah. Nothing in there? Whoa. Okay. I'm gonna be unstoppable.

970
02:56:14,950 --> 02:56:29,700
Uh oh. Red. I haven't seen red or blue. Mermaids. Luck. Increased luck.

971
02:56:35,559 --> 02:56:48,489
Anything else? Oh. Turn around. I've gotten too greedy. I thought there was shit over here.

972
02:56:49,049 --> 02:57:06,219
Should I board him? Let's see what he does. I think red is the actually one to be afraid of.

973
02:57:14,420 --> 02:57:21,350
No this is very heavily guarded right now. I'm going down here.

974
02:57:23,590 --> 02:57:44,629
Do I have everything that I can? 99, 66, 39, 23, 24, 15, 6. Unstoppable. Could have another hero too.

975
02:57:44,629 --> 02:57:49,750
Yeah I could have another hero. Um maybe I'm absolutely gonna pick like this weird frog guy.

976
02:57:50,549 --> 02:58:03,239
All right who am I gonna give you? You're gonna you're gonna go off on your own adventure.

977
02:58:05,620 --> 02:58:15,110
Um you don't get anybody. Have this one person farm golems. That would be

978
02:58:15,670 --> 02:58:25,879
useful. All right you go off on an adventure. In fact, no I can't fit a bolt in the boat.

979
02:58:26,600 --> 02:58:51,639
You gotta make your way over here. I need like two boats. Head down here. Okay let's move on.

980
02:58:56,760 --> 02:59:03,909
That's where I'm going. Blue just hanging out right there. Can I see what he has?

981
02:59:04,870 --> 02:59:07,590
The Freelancer's Guild. I feel like there's something good there.

982
02:59:12,059 --> 02:59:21,690
Let's land. A lot of shit over here. I don't know where we got you. Let's see. What do you want to do

983
02:59:21,690 --> 02:59:30,149
here? Go back. You go to the Golem Hut. We got there available. Uh we're almost at the next week.

984
02:59:30,149 --> 02:59:39,659
You can take some. We also have Ewan here who I could bring you out. But should this be the

985
02:59:39,659 --> 02:59:57,770
Stax Defender? Level one Alchemist or the Edamon the Burning Guy. Specialty Golems.

986
02:59:58,870 --> 03:00:41,110
Specialty Golems. Should she just take a bunch? Just take the Golems? Just take them all. I mean

987
03:00:41,110 --> 03:00:55,319
she is the Golem like queen. All right you take the Golems. Have fun. All right let's go. Five

988
03:00:55,319 --> 03:01:09,670
gems. Witch Hut. Basic Offense. What does the specialty do? Increases the attack and defense

989
03:01:09,670 --> 03:01:14,149
skills of any stone or iron Golems for each level attained after third level.

990
03:01:14,950 --> 03:01:21,879
Xena. It's a frog guy. You kind of uh you're kind of like useless at this point.

991
03:01:22,760 --> 03:01:31,370
Anything else to upgrade? Golem Factory. Probably should just have. I probably should have done

992
03:01:31,370 --> 03:01:41,590
that before. Send her back. Waste of a turn but whatever. Oh yeah I'll put frog guy in a boat.

993
03:01:42,549 --> 03:01:54,389
Send him somewhere. All right we'll do that after. Go back. Upgrade these guys. 41 iron Golems

994
03:01:56,680 --> 03:02:01,319
and let's buy as many people as we can. I can leave. I got this. These are so good.

995
03:02:03,030 --> 03:02:17,940
I all right I got enough Golem. No just yeah we're gonna go. I got 41 iron Golems. Here we go.

996
03:02:17,940 --> 03:02:27,270
Time to start with you. We've got Shipyard. I mean do I should just buy it? Own it? Does it really

997
03:02:27,270 --> 03:02:38,489
matter? We got Freelancer's Guild. Please inspect our find. Whereas if you feel like offering a trade

998
03:02:38,489 --> 03:02:49,670
click on the items you wish to trade for. Oh I see. I can give you two iron Golems for one wood.

999
03:02:49,670 --> 03:02:59,719
Oh get the fuck out of here. No thanks. Try and learn third level spell. Frost Ring.

1000
03:03:00,600 --> 03:03:15,530
Lots of holders. It's a gold mine. I think I could take them. We got uh idle fortune. Let's get it.

1001
03:03:16,889 --> 03:03:23,819
What about you? I want to get you shipping out here. I can't buy a boat but I will next turn.

1002
03:03:24,780 --> 03:03:53,940
Out of money comes taxes of course. Frost Ring. Magic Arrow is 50 points. There's a lot of them

1003
03:03:53,940 --> 03:04:23,860
but are they are they magic resistant? Not bad. We can take them. Oof that hurt.

1004
03:04:30,379 --> 03:04:50,819
Get in there. Got this. Spread them out a little bit. You go forward here. Yeah we're good. I need

1005
03:04:51,059 --> 03:04:54,420
I should meet that lady somewhere in the middle and transfer the golems to her.

1006
03:04:55,299 --> 03:05:12,379
Although there's no bonus for these golems unfortunately right?

1007
03:05:13,260 --> 03:05:30,500
This way. One last gremlin remains. I think that gremlin's gonna stay alive.

1008
03:05:34,969 --> 03:05:54,120
These things have we've gonna lose our skeleton stack I think. Although we should get some more.

1009
03:05:58,790 --> 03:06:11,590
Lost 29 skeletons. Ton of experience though. Ooh fourth level spells. Basic earth magic. I need

1010
03:06:11,590 --> 03:06:27,350
to go and learn some spells. Four gems. One a day. Good. All right let's go this way. Thousand

1011
03:06:27,350 --> 03:06:49,319
experience. This is this guy's capital. Purple. Not strong enough to take that yet. All right golem

1012
03:06:49,319 --> 03:06:59,319
lady needs to go down to golem center. Right here. We need to get wood. We need boats. I need a ton

1013
03:06:59,319 --> 03:07:11,719
of shit. Yeah the second city. I mean no one's coming near this. This has been untouched. Maybe

1014
03:07:11,719 --> 03:07:14,760
it's time to put some resources into this and actually make it. But I don't have any money,

1015
03:07:14,760 --> 03:07:21,340
I don't have any resources. I need wood. Can't do anything with it right now. You cannot get a boat

1016
03:07:21,340 --> 03:07:38,549
so I can't do anything with you. You may as well just sit here. All right gold mine. Den of thieves.

1017
03:07:39,909 --> 03:07:54,969
I'm actually interested in right now. Here we go. Best hero. Number of towns. Red. So red is

1018
03:07:55,530 --> 03:08:00,629
oh jesus wyverns. Everybody has something really strong.

1019
03:08:01,430 --> 03:08:13,959
I'm terrible on defense but I'm powerful in everything else. Now this dude has a legit red

1020
03:08:13,959 --> 03:08:34,520
dragon. Look at that face. I have the best income. Good to know. All right homestead. Purple. Let's

1021
03:08:34,520 --> 03:08:42,739
take all this shit away from purple. Do it next turn. Don't have enough for a boat. So you two

1022
03:08:42,739 --> 03:08:59,610
just gonna have to sit here. Let's go back this way. Lookout tower. A lot of knowledge. This cloud

1023
03:08:59,610 --> 03:09:13,430
temple. I need it's just my resources are so depleted. I'm just gonna have to keep going.

1024
03:09:14,229 --> 03:09:24,090
What is this on? This is just on pc. It's on windows 10. Good old games. It works perfectly

1025
03:09:24,090 --> 03:09:29,209
fine. There's an HD patch. You don't have to get the HD remaster. The HD remaster on steam

1026
03:09:29,690 --> 03:09:36,170
is unfortunately I guess doesn't have any of the expansion packs. Doesn't have any added content.

1027
03:09:37,370 --> 03:09:54,979
It's a thousand gold a day. Medusa stores. Homestead. Recruit wood elves. Yeah Medusa stores.

1028
03:09:55,700 --> 03:10:16,700
This is probably Medusa's. I don't have enough. All right it might be time to upgrade this to the

1029
03:10:16,860 --> 03:10:26,940
town. What are we gonna get here? Tavern for a fort. City hall. I need tavern and mage guild.

1030
03:10:26,940 --> 03:10:33,159
Taverns. No that's wood. Resource silo. Mage. It's all wood. I need the wood.

1031
03:10:38,040 --> 03:10:49,620
No not until I get a boat. Although I might as well just. I'll take 85 of these. Why not?

1032
03:10:50,260 --> 03:11:00,790
At least there's somebody there. Resource silo is five. Five thousand. What do I have? I have plenty.

1033
03:11:00,790 --> 03:11:07,639
Yeah let's build the resource silo. I can do it on both. Resource silo. Five thousand and five.

1034
03:11:07,639 --> 03:11:19,079
Do it again. That's plus two gems a day. Just waiting for the goddamn wood so I can get this

1035
03:11:19,079 --> 03:11:36,889
person in a boat and send him. How much are you? Not quite enough to get these. All right let's go.

1036
03:11:37,450 --> 03:11:46,520
I'm about to be at the stage where I'm gonna. Uh-oh. Oh fuck. That guy just landed.

1037
03:11:50,420 --> 03:12:01,139
Oh. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Not my two scouts. Nine.

1038
03:12:02,579 --> 03:12:27,719
Boat. Give me his boat. See you later motherfucker. All right. I mean I've got. I've got 47 iron

1039
03:12:27,719 --> 03:12:44,409
golems. I'm gonna get out of here with this lady. Stalem. He has a horde. Horde. Horde. He has like

1040
03:12:44,409 --> 03:12:53,510
hundreds of people. Body block him. I can't body block him. It's all right. We still have

1041
03:12:53,510 --> 03:13:08,219
uh Professor Thant. Guys no one's taking this castle. Not with Professor Thant. Okay what's

1042
03:13:08,219 --> 03:13:16,579
the Medusa stores? What happened? Oh somebody already took it. I got scared for a second. All

1043
03:13:16,579 --> 03:13:20,819
right let's go this way. The windmill. Already visited that. Already went to the dead thieves.

1044
03:13:21,780 --> 03:13:29,290
Let's go to the dwarven treasury. We found a dwarven treasury. Do you wish to attack the guards?

1045
03:13:46,870 --> 03:13:54,469
What? What? What'd I just do? 20% magic resist. I have an 80% chance to hit you with that.

1046
03:13:58,069 --> 03:14:13,059
That was bullshit. It's all right. You take this one on. Good. Look at that. That's a ton of damage.

1047
03:14:14,309 --> 03:14:23,559
Uh I think I'm just gonna split up into the four corners. Take the skeletons

1048
03:14:24,360 --> 03:14:38,760
up here. All right you. Both you guys kill this one.

1049
03:14:40,440 --> 03:14:47,559
Yeah you're getting counter-attacked every five seconds. Yeah you're trying to run away.

1050
03:14:49,959 --> 03:15:02,360
Uh who do I want to shoot at? Probably probably you. And then you uh go up and help the skeletons.

1051
03:15:03,079 --> 03:15:26,180
I don't care about this guy. He's gonna die. Here you just go up. Save this guy. He's fine.

1052
03:15:27,739 --> 03:15:37,340
He's the body blocker. He is official body blocker.

1053
03:15:57,530 --> 03:16:07,690
Dead. Dead. Dead. Dead. Dead. A lot of dwarves here. There better be a ton of good shit in here.

1054
03:16:07,690 --> 03:16:26,889
I'm gonna be very upset. No get away from my archers. He's strong. All right run away. No fuck.

1055
03:16:26,889 --> 03:16:34,260
I thought I had the other guy selected. I had. I thought I had that this guy was selected.

1056
03:16:34,819 --> 03:16:55,700
I'm fine. There. See. Just kill him.

1057
03:17:00,629 --> 03:17:18,899
All right you got one dwarf left. Not a big deal. Costly battle. It's fine.

1058
03:17:18,899 --> 03:17:28,120
There it is. 2,000 experience. That's a lot. I did lose some but you know that was. There's

1059
03:17:28,120 --> 03:17:37,899
a hundred dwarves guys. Advanced resistance. Yes. Having defeated the battle dwarves you

1060
03:17:37,899 --> 03:17:47,370
discover five crystals and 5,000 gold. It's actually exactly what I needed. Here's an obelisk.

1061
03:17:49,850 --> 03:17:54,379
Um I don't know what to do here though. Unfortunately this is not good. This is not

1062
03:17:54,379 --> 03:18:01,049
good at all. Nobody else to recruit. I kind of have to run away or sacrifice myself.

1063
03:18:01,850 --> 03:18:11,850
I got the guy on the boat but he might just. Okay. Perfect scenario is he turns around

1064
03:18:12,489 --> 03:18:24,709
and is pissed that I took the boat and fights me. There's nowhere for me to go. Hide. Hide.

1065
03:18:25,510 --> 03:18:34,459
What is the hide? He has a full turn coming up. Bring Thant out. Should I bring Thant out and

1066
03:18:34,459 --> 03:19:06,780
just have him just run down here? I could do that. Are you ready for this? Let's go. Oh you're dead.

1067
03:19:06,780 --> 03:19:20,889
You ran right by me. All right. Obelisk. What the hell? Puzzle map. What is this? Puzzle map?

1068
03:19:21,450 --> 03:19:43,590
What do I do with this? I have missing pieces or. Hmm. I need all the pieces. I don't have it.

1069
03:19:44,149 --> 03:19:53,340
All right. We have some some shit going down. So expert. I didn't say I was an expert. I

1070
03:19:53,340 --> 03:20:02,020
said I'd played this when I was a young kid. I don't know if that does. All right. Uh warrior's

1071
03:20:02,020 --> 03:20:13,690
tomb. Let's keep going. What is this one? Haste. That's a good spell. Warrior's tomb. Mushrooms.

1072
03:20:13,690 --> 03:20:26,739
Let's just get a view here. Oh fuck. Uh oh. All right. This is a fight. This is a fight to end

1073
03:20:26,739 --> 03:20:37,110
all fights. What do you think? Is it time? Is it time to get to go nuts? I'll get a lot of

1074
03:20:37,110 --> 03:20:51,020
experience with this one. Here we go. Skeleton horde versus very powerful genies and very powerful

1075
03:20:51,020 --> 03:21:06,090
queens. Okay. We've got. Let me take a look here. Genie. Genie can move very very fluidly.

1076
03:21:06,889 --> 03:21:13,799
We've got bloodlust. Curse. Protection from fire. Increase the hand-to-hand damage inflicted by the

1077
03:21:13,799 --> 03:21:18,920
selected unit. Cause the selected enemy unit to inflict minimum damage in combat.

1078
03:21:24,549 --> 03:21:30,579
The spell will affect nobody. Okay. What about bloodlust? Should I give bloodlust to the genie?

1079
03:21:32,469 --> 03:21:47,690
Well bloodlust to the uh to the naga queens. Stone skin. How long does it last? Just for the whole

1080
03:21:47,690 --> 03:21:56,569
the whole thing. Bloodlust on the naga queens. We're gonna get these guys in a favorable position.

1081
03:21:57,780 --> 03:22:07,129
I'm gonna say like right here. Same deal. Get you guys in a favorable position.

1082
03:22:13,239 --> 03:22:24,860
All right. We've got the naga queens. On you up here probably. Let's get like up here.

1083
03:22:29,129 --> 03:22:38,549
Oh that hurts. All right. You're ranged. Nice. That does a lot. Just get you guys up there.

1084
03:22:38,549 --> 03:22:46,020
You're just like a shield essentially at this point. I need the mages. Who else is ranged? Nice.

1085
03:22:46,020 --> 03:23:01,350
Beautiful. Oh I thought that was gonna do it. Vampire. All right. Going for the queens. Genie

1086
03:23:01,350 --> 03:23:09,559
time. Now spell cast a random benefit. He can pretty much go anywhere in the map. I wonder if

1087
03:23:09,559 --> 03:23:14,760
I should just take out the lich. I think I can get the lich with the gremlins. I mean I could buff.

1088
03:23:15,479 --> 03:23:29,500
Cast a spell on obsidian gargoyles. Cast a spell on the naga queens. How would I get shield?

1089
03:23:31,270 --> 03:23:48,579
66. I'm going for a I think we'll go for the the wraiths. Oh that was easy. Trying to kill

1090
03:23:48,579 --> 03:23:53,700
this. Oh fuck. That was bad. All right. I'm gonna go with the queens up here. Big unit versus big

1091
03:23:53,700 --> 03:24:10,090
unit. Let's go. What did that do? How much did he kill? Get rid of this guy. Did one. I mean this

1092
03:24:10,090 --> 03:24:31,270
thing is insane. So once this is done it's it's over. Okay. I gotta play smart here. I can't

1093
03:24:31,270 --> 03:24:42,010
curse anybody. Maybe bloodlust on on genie. I'm gonna do more like stone skin on the naga.

1094
03:24:49,620 --> 03:24:56,139
Curse? I don't think I can. I can't curse anybody. I'm gonna do stone skin on

1095
03:24:57,340 --> 03:25:04,739
on naga. All right. We gotta we gotta focus on this dude here.

1096
03:25:06,760 --> 03:25:17,260
Two black knight stone. Good. This thing has to die. Genie. Should I just buff the queen again?

1097
03:25:18,059 --> 03:25:22,889
Should we just buff the fuck out of the queens? I think I can kill it.

1098
03:25:25,940 --> 03:25:33,350
Yes. All right. We're good. 62 versus uh with 10. Five. It's in the bag.

1099
03:25:38,889 --> 03:25:51,020
Yeah this is the bag. I ain't got nothing. I win. Ran away. I lost. Not very much.

1100
03:25:54,549 --> 03:26:04,700
Level four. Advanced wisdom. Fourth level spells or basic water magic. It's a good thing I had this

1101
03:26:04,700 --> 03:26:21,399
guy. Let's do water magic. All right. Cool. All right. Back to bed. That's all I wanted you to do.

1102
03:26:21,399 --> 03:26:27,799
I wanted to go get more minions. You on the other hand. Uh there's a boat there now. I have a scout.

1103
03:26:31,049 --> 03:26:37,670
I can do two boats. Not yet. You need to go exploring.

1104
03:26:45,959 --> 03:26:58,200
Just search. Yes. Nothing there. Got nothing in there.

1105
03:27:03,430 --> 03:27:12,600
You have you got a lot of stuff too. Make another boat. I think I'm gonna do two boats here. Yeah.

1106
03:27:12,600 --> 03:27:29,059
Let's go. Let's get in there. Opportunity down here. Middle thing in the castle. I can do the

1107
03:27:29,059 --> 03:27:39,350
trolls maybe. How are we doing on resources? Wall of knowledge. How much is this? Five and a

1108
03:27:39,350 --> 03:27:45,110
thousand. Yeah. Just build it. Let's go. Plus one knowledge. Anybody that goes in. I've got able to

1109
03:27:45,110 --> 03:28:00,659
recruit. All right. Let's go. Uh oh. I'm on the defensive now. Who came in? Oh shit. It's purple.

1110
03:28:03,290 --> 03:28:16,250
Who did you attack? Oh I'm down there. I don't. This is bad. You've got unicorns. Shit. This is

1111
03:28:16,250 --> 03:28:32,170
not good. This is this is a losing battle. 100. It's the same guy with the 100 plus centaurs. Um

1112
03:28:32,969 --> 03:28:57,620
but I could probably take a few people out and then run away. This is so many crystal things to

1113
03:28:57,620 --> 03:29:17,879
lose. Oh no. Wait. What does surrender do? What's the difference? I'm just gonna. I mean I'm just

1114
03:29:17,879 --> 03:29:34,840
gonna. I bet. Apparently I'm just gonna run. Here we go. Surrender lets you keep your army for a

1115
03:29:34,840 --> 03:29:40,250
price. Oh no. Fuck that. Thankfully this guy doesn't have the whole army.

1116
03:29:47,879 --> 03:30:02,469
I lose badly in both scenarios. How much is it to surrender? I wonder like what do I have to pay?

1117
03:30:03,430 --> 03:30:38,280
Coward. But at least I keep the artifacts. He's back. I had a lot of artifacts on that guy. I'm

1118
03:30:38,280 --> 03:30:55,879
gonna lose him. We're good. Okay. Now you. Well this is our new main anyways. One knowledge.

1119
03:31:10,520 --> 03:31:25,940
Give me your shit. Come outside please. All right. Level eight versus level four.

1120
03:31:28,569 --> 03:31:32,489
I mean I guess we could. He's level eight. Should I just give him everything?

1121
03:31:35,350 --> 03:31:45,379
Maybe I'll just give him everything because he's level eight. Ballista. I can only have one.

1122
03:31:45,379 --> 03:31:54,870
Ballista. I can do the ten. This is a glyph of gallantry. Mara by one or health of all units.

1123
03:31:54,870 --> 03:32:21,379
No that's way better. Okay. Fant has better. I'm gonna keep Fant on defense. In fact I want to

1124
03:32:22,100 --> 03:32:32,219
Okay. You've already visited. I gotta get something else here though. Oh yeah the gold.

1125
03:32:32,219 --> 03:32:41,420
Gold. Gold. Give me the bag. Switch the bag. That'll be forever protected. Oh I can actually take

1126
03:32:41,420 --> 03:32:50,629
this. Because now I gave him the bag of gold. Very nice. Very nice. So Fant. Get back in here.

1127
03:32:51,510 --> 03:33:05,620
It is your job. I think I have to move you. He is the one that will defend this castle. Get in here.

1128
03:33:06,420 --> 03:33:29,299
Summon boat. Dispel. Slow. Stone skin. Um can I learn any of these? I have to upgrade it. Yeah

1129
03:33:29,299 --> 03:33:35,739
it's level one. What is that? Thousand. It just costs resources. All right. We'll switch it out.

1130
03:33:35,739 --> 03:33:40,840
We have. You have a lot of good people now. You're forced to be reckoned with completely.

1131
03:33:44,899 --> 03:33:49,139
Uh I'm looking. Hopefully I can recruit something. I could get some more golems.

1132
03:33:49,219 --> 03:34:01,959
All right. I'm going back down. All right. We got boats. You have 47 golems. I wonder if I can

1133
03:34:01,959 --> 03:34:07,819
fight the trolls with these. I'm kind of scared to do that. Yeah what is Nimbus's specialty? That's

1134
03:34:07,819 --> 03:34:14,040
a good question. Specialty is eagle eye. She's five percent per level bonus to eagle eye skill

1135
03:34:14,040 --> 03:34:22,149
percentage. What about you? What's your specialty? Eagle eye again. This dude sucks. This dude's only

1136
03:34:22,149 --> 03:34:25,940
purpose is to like walk around and look at stuff. Nobody even here.

1137
03:34:29,639 --> 03:34:39,559
Claim that castle. It's mine. You are gonna go. Who's over here? You a shipyard. Avoid that. Go

1138
03:34:39,559 --> 03:34:47,940
down here. You know what I'm saying? Like up this way maybe. Or down here. Let's go down here.

1139
03:34:50,180 --> 03:35:07,100
He's taking everything back. Wood elf growth plus five dwellings increase population.

1140
03:35:07,899 --> 03:35:15,579
Damn it. I'm so annoyed. Right at the last day they came back.

1141
03:35:19,020 --> 03:35:32,090
That sucks. Why does this guy always pre-record his screams? It's just easier that way. I actually

1142
03:35:34,139 --> 03:35:42,250
weirdly enough. We can bring this up now. I'm actually like 52 years old. By the time you're

1143
03:35:42,250 --> 03:35:49,959
seeing this. I've recorded like eight or nine thousand like six hour sessions and I batch

1144
03:35:49,959 --> 03:35:57,190
uploaded all of them and they're all scheduled to go. I'm actually like 50. I've been doing this. I

1145
03:35:57,190 --> 03:36:02,940
did this like I don't know maybe 30 like 20 years ago or so. It's kind of I guess that kind of they

1146
03:36:02,940 --> 03:36:16,139
can come out. Sirens. What did that say? A bunch of people dove out of a bunch of people drowned

1147
03:36:16,139 --> 03:36:39,639
themselves. That's great. I lost half my army. That sucks. Let's go with plus two attack. I don't

1148
03:36:39,639 --> 03:36:45,139
get in there so bad and I can't do anything about that either. No this dude's gonna have to go

1149
03:36:45,139 --> 03:37:01,879
explore over on this side. They're already showing these to me. Castle ship. Go take it. I don't think

1150
03:37:01,879 --> 03:37:16,010
I can. I have like 40 frogs. I don't think they're gonna be good enough. Yeah they have much better

1151
03:37:16,010 --> 03:37:36,760
units that I do. I'll just get down here. I think I can handle this up here now. Yeah I can handle

1152
03:37:36,760 --> 03:37:54,840
this. I'm going up here. That's a gold mine. That's a mercenary camp. Let's go for it. War machine

1153
03:37:54,840 --> 03:38:00,920
factory. I already have one of these. Lots of harpy hags. That will be the next thing I do.

1154
03:38:01,799 --> 03:38:20,600
Speaking of doing. Level two. Remove obstacle lightning bolt. Disrupting ray and fortune.

1155
03:38:21,559 --> 03:38:52,280
Cool. Other town. I don't have enough money. Let's go. All the purple is over here on the right side.

1156
03:38:52,760 --> 03:39:03,559
There's the fucking taxes again. Goose eggs. Zero everywhere. What do you guys have? Pack several

1157
03:39:03,559 --> 03:39:21,239
lots. Pack. I could kill this one. I do have a lot of gems. Gotta have a lot of gem. I have more gem

1158
03:39:22,200 --> 03:39:26,180
buildings than I have anything else. All right you just keep going over here.

1159
03:39:32,219 --> 03:39:45,829
Damn it. All right harpy hags. Do not engage. They're afraid. Touch the obelisk. Puzzle map.

1160
03:39:45,829 --> 03:39:58,920
Don't have them all unfortunately. Lots of captains. Centaur captains. I wonder if I can do it.

1161
03:39:59,639 --> 03:40:12,180
Don't engage. They're afraid. Recruit stone gargoyles. How many do I have? No I don't want that.

1162
03:40:13,079 --> 03:40:16,920
Now this is where it's going to get hard. These are absolutely going to attack me.

1163
03:40:17,559 --> 03:40:32,139
Morale increased. Lots of silver. Pegas high. They scatter. I'm so powerful. A thousand more a day.

1164
03:40:33,020 --> 03:40:35,579
Nice. Awesome. And I'll go to the mercenary camp up here and get all this stuff.

1165
03:40:36,219 --> 03:40:43,219
Now what the hell am I going to do with you? I'm just going to put you. This is just a scout.

1166
03:40:43,940 --> 03:40:57,979
Head this way. I mean he's definitely, he's dead. He's dead.

1167
03:40:58,059 --> 03:41:20,620
Uh oh. They got a bone dragon. Time to die. Four. You killed fucking 33. 25 to 50 damage.

1168
03:41:23,959 --> 03:41:45,979
That's insane. Let's go this way. Ow. Hey you. Get that motherfucker out of here.

1169
03:41:46,540 --> 03:41:58,860
Lots of, they're going to run away too. All right. Look at all this shit up here. We got mercenary camp.

1170
03:41:59,739 --> 03:42:07,340
Plus one attack. A thousand experience. Expert resistance. That's huge.

1171
03:42:08,229 --> 03:42:14,329
20 magic resistance. A thousand gold or 500 experience. We're going to do the experience

1172
03:42:14,329 --> 03:42:32,409
I think. Both of them. 1500 experience. Level 10. Expert wisdom. Basic learning.

1173
03:42:33,930 --> 03:42:39,770
That seems like the expert wisdom or basic learning.

1174
03:42:44,680 --> 03:42:51,139
Are they the same kind of thing? Level fifth level spells. I got to go back and do this.

1175
03:42:53,540 --> 03:43:00,940
Expert wisdom. Wisdom and learning. High wisdom, low intelligence.

1176
03:43:02,459 --> 03:43:08,969
Should I be, should I learn? No, that's just experience. But

1177
03:43:10,790 --> 03:43:16,860
all right. We're going to do the basic learning. All right. I've cleaned this out.

1178
03:43:16,940 --> 03:43:25,979
This guy's pretty strong now. My only concern is now with the unguarded couple of places here is

1179
03:43:26,620 --> 03:43:38,090
someone's going to be coming here. You just landed. What do you got? That's not good. Purple is going

1180
03:43:38,090 --> 03:43:43,370
to be coming up this way. I have to bring you back to the castle. You can just go like Magellan this

1181
03:43:43,370 --> 03:44:03,909
way. There's nothing over here. Don't even tell me there's nothing here. Artifact merchant. Library.

1182
03:44:03,909 --> 03:44:10,979
Lookout tower. I can do that. No, that's 10,000. Let's just recruit some people. I'm going to spend

1183
03:44:10,979 --> 03:44:25,030
the money. Just in case for some reason he gets here. Let's go. Depends on what Purple's going to

1184
03:44:25,030 --> 03:44:38,870
do. Oh no. He got it. Did he just go in the boat? He's taking everything. What am I doing out here?

1185
03:44:38,870 --> 03:44:54,090
There's nothing even out. This just rocks. Oh shit. Holy crap. This just rocks and shit.

1186
03:44:54,899 --> 03:45:06,520
He took all my stuff. Where are you? Throng Horde Horde Swarm Horde Pack. Is this a fight?

1187
03:45:07,159 --> 03:45:17,530
I mean this must be like 300. No, no, no, no, no, no. This is going to be a battle at the castle,

1188
03:45:17,530 --> 03:45:33,180
I think. I'm not going to be able to make it back. I'm not going to be able to make it back in time.

1189
03:45:42,409 --> 03:45:45,370
No, we're okay. This is a pretty decent defense.

1190
03:46:12,950 --> 03:46:36,899
See what happens. Thank God. What an idiot. Yes. Oh, he didn't do anything. He just turned around.

1191
03:46:37,299 --> 03:46:52,040
He got scared. Come on. I have to wait another turn to do this? Give me my stuff back. It's mine,

1192
03:46:52,040 --> 03:46:59,180
not yours. I just ruined everything. I just fucking ruined everything. He can kill me now

1193
03:46:59,180 --> 03:47:03,850
because of a goddamn gold mine or a gem mine. Whatever the hell it was. I'm dead.

1194
03:47:04,899 --> 03:47:15,829
If he decides to turn around and attack me, I'm dead. Oh, thank God he went the other way.

1195
03:47:16,709 --> 03:47:19,270
I'm excited about this though. This is completely uncharted territory.

1196
03:47:24,340 --> 03:47:40,329
Whoa, this is a dragon utopia. You stand before the dragon utopia, a place off limits to mere

1197
03:47:40,329 --> 03:47:51,110
humans. Do you wish to violate this rule and challenge the dragons to a fight? I don't think

1198
03:47:51,110 --> 03:48:04,139
I do, but that's cool that it's down here. I could probably recruit like next level dragons down here.

1199
03:48:07,739 --> 03:48:26,100
Save scum it and just see what it is. I couldn't go back in. The cursor wouldn't let me do it

1200
03:48:26,899 --> 03:48:33,190
because I was already standing on the space. I was standing on the one spot where I was

1201
03:48:33,190 --> 03:48:44,600
allowed to do it, so I had to move. Let's do it again. I already learned that. I already learned

1202
03:48:44,600 --> 03:49:01,879
that. Let's go. I'm actually not afraid anymore. He already cleaned this all out. I feel like,

1203
03:49:01,879 --> 03:49:07,299
no, I'm going to go back and I'm going to keep, I'm going to recruit more. Yeah,

1204
03:49:08,020 --> 03:49:24,459
I'm going to take all these guys because I want to be unbeatable over here. All right, I need

1205
03:49:24,459 --> 03:49:43,610
a, I need 20 wood. What is this? Five wood? It's not worth it. I need the wood. City hall. I need mage

1206
03:49:43,610 --> 03:49:55,190
and yeah, but I just, I'm going to burn all my wood. Whatever. Nobody claims this.

1207
03:49:59,670 --> 03:50:18,969
Yeah, tax day is coming up. You're right. Well, you're just stuck down here now. I was,

1208
03:50:20,620 --> 03:50:24,139
I just forgot. I was supposed to just go look in there, but I saved it. It don't matter.

1209
03:50:24,860 --> 03:50:31,659
I, I'm all right. Whatever. If I like, okay, if I went in there and I died,

1210
03:50:31,659 --> 03:50:37,590
I would have had to do like that whole last turn again. I don't know. Whatever. It don't matter.

1211
03:50:37,590 --> 03:51:00,569
Like do you really want me to like redo the last whole turn? There's no way I'm doing this.

1212
03:51:09,100 --> 03:51:21,639
Well, it's every kind of dragon. What do they have stats? 40 to 50, 40. No, you've got to come in

1213
03:51:21,639 --> 03:51:40,299
here with like a hundred at least dead. Well, there it is. That's a cool little thing though.

1214
03:51:40,299 --> 03:51:44,600
That's an interesting little like secret. All right. I was going to go up here.

1215
03:51:45,319 --> 03:51:53,430
I was going to do this. I want more minions and then I'm taking you on a boat and we're going

1216
03:51:53,430 --> 03:51:57,190
to try to kill somebody. I'm going to try to wipe somebody up. Just coming up this turn coming up.

1217
03:51:59,610 --> 03:52:16,069
All right. No, it was this one over here. Tavern. You have made us very pleased. Good.

1218
03:52:16,069 --> 03:52:24,709
Now you have to just get out of here. You just, oh, I hate that. I have to do this shit.

1219
03:52:25,670 --> 03:52:49,100
All right. I want mage tower level three. I need six pots. I can get that right now.

1220
03:52:49,100 --> 03:52:57,899
Learn spells. Level three. What else we got? We got air shield, destroy undead, force field.

1221
03:52:58,540 --> 03:53:22,489
Let's bring them in and we're going to look at this. So many. So many. I don't know. Should

1222
03:53:22,489 --> 03:53:31,639
I take them all? I'll be unstoppable. All right. Let's learn a spell. So destroy undead. Attempts

1223
03:53:31,639 --> 03:53:39,829
to destroy any undead creatures in the battlefield. Force field. Place a small force field on the

1224
03:53:39,829 --> 03:53:46,389
battlefield at a point specified by the caster. Destroy undead sounds really good. Shield is a

1225
03:53:46,389 --> 03:53:49,989
selected unit reducing the amount of damage received from ranged attacks. That's really good

1226
03:53:49,989 --> 03:54:10,889
too. Maybe destroy undead. So now how do I put a spell on? I'm curious because how do I get it on

1227
03:54:10,889 --> 03:54:23,799
here? Right click? Or being like the book? Or do I just do what is good? Oh, you auto learn them.

1228
03:54:23,799 --> 03:54:31,430
Okay. That makes sense. Let's, let me just make sure. All right. Cool. So you just get them all.

1229
03:54:33,930 --> 03:54:38,409
All right. Uh, we're at the end of the week. I'm going to wait. I'm going to recruit and then I'm,

1230
03:54:38,409 --> 03:54:42,090
this is the character that is, Nimbus is going to kill everyone. I'm going to take them

1231
03:54:42,090 --> 03:54:51,399
on a journey to wipe out every opponent. I've upgraded all my dudes. I'm ready for a fucking

1232
03:54:51,399 --> 03:54:59,930
bloodbath. Anything else I can get up here that has been taken from me? Let's go to the windmill.

1233
03:54:59,930 --> 03:55:11,299
Just three, six crystals. Might as well take it. All right. I'm good like this. Uh, I guess I could.

1234
03:55:11,940 --> 03:55:31,079
I need, no, I don't have any resources for it. Let's go. Here comes a new week. All dwellings

1235
03:55:31,079 --> 03:55:38,389
increase population. Unfortunately, you're just stuck back here for an undetermined amount of time.

1236
03:55:40,059 --> 03:55:57,000
All right. Money. Recruit everyone. I am now a real ruler. I've got a lot of people.

1237
03:55:57,799 --> 03:56:03,930
A very scary amount. I have very highly skilled people. I don't know if I want the skeletons.

1238
03:56:09,239 --> 03:56:21,590
18 queens. All right. I need 20 wood. I have to do the mage guild and then the city hall.

1239
03:56:25,659 --> 03:56:39,590
All right. I can't do it yet, but I am ready. The question is, should I, hmm, should I take

1240
03:56:39,590 --> 03:56:48,860
this fucking place over? It's mine. Get it. Take it from orange. Go take all this stuff and then

1241
03:56:48,860 --> 03:56:57,239
summon a boat down here. I think I could take this. I think I could kill them both and then take a

1242
03:56:57,239 --> 03:57:08,569
boat. It's either that or the other scenario is I could go here. All right. So run down here.

1243
03:57:09,290 --> 03:57:17,139
Go try to kill the dragons. Oh, that's so scary. If I go kill the dragons, I have nobody available

1244
03:57:17,700 --> 03:57:34,309
to defend my only remaining two structures. The troll bridge. Yeah. But then you'll have dragons.

1245
03:57:34,309 --> 03:57:40,780
Yeah. I need to build up defenses too. I've got to go like wipe somebody. I've got to go kill

1246
03:57:40,780 --> 03:57:55,370
somebody. I've got to get up here. He's like right here. I could take this. Take this. Kill him.

1247
03:57:58,040 --> 03:58:02,889
Go to the troll bridge. Let's just wait. I got to get this guy on a boat anyway. So let's get in a

1248
03:58:02,889 --> 03:58:23,500
boat. All right. Let's go. Blue is not sure what he wants to do. There's the taxes. Didn't have

1249
03:58:23,500 --> 03:58:32,760
anything anyways. So far away. It just takes forever for you to get over here. Okay. How many points?

1250
03:58:32,760 --> 03:58:45,750
I got 100 points. I could go to the golem factory, which there are. Who should I get?

1251
03:58:46,629 --> 03:59:01,989
What do you think? Two diamond or three gold? Why not both? I don't have enough room for both.

1252
03:59:01,989 --> 03:59:06,489
I don't. Yeah. I only have one slot. Diamond? Yeah. Diamond's probably better.

1253
03:59:12,260 --> 03:59:15,700
Gold's more cost effective, but diamond is almost unheard of from spells.

1254
03:59:18,059 --> 03:59:28,809
Oh boy. This is iron, right? Okay. Pretty good group. Let's see if I can summon a boat.

1255
03:59:29,530 --> 03:59:34,280
Well, you have a boat. Should I just trade? You want to trade boats?

1256
03:59:35,000 --> 04:00:01,670
Just. Boy, they've been so fucked with wood this whole game. Uh oh. You going to the dragon?

1257
04:00:03,579 --> 04:00:05,819
This guy's heading to like the dragon's den.

1258
04:00:10,469 --> 04:00:27,450
I got to get away from you. Nobody in here. Well, I don't think I can fight you

1259
04:00:29,930 --> 04:00:36,940
although you don't really have anything that scary. We have packs small. No. He's going to

1260
04:00:36,940 --> 04:00:45,860
go die to the dragons. Let me see if I can get a boat here because there's a couple of boats.

1261
04:00:46,579 --> 04:00:58,010
Summoned boat. Do you not have summoned boat? Fuck. You don't have summoned boat.

1262
04:01:08,379 --> 04:01:20,840
Well, I'm just going to have to wait till you bring it up here. I clicked the wrong button.

1263
04:01:26,760 --> 04:01:55,049
Oh, there it is. Did I get it? How do I cast it? Not from the inventory. I can't just. I have to.

1264
04:01:55,049 --> 04:01:59,370
That's not. That is not the spell book. I thought it was failed to summon a boat.

1265
04:02:00,170 --> 04:02:07,989
I thought I could do it from both places. Uh, I, is this even possible? I, I,

1266
04:02:08,870 --> 04:02:11,270
is there even a friendly boat? This is why I have one friend. Let me go.

1267
04:02:12,090 --> 04:02:19,850
There are no boats to some and I just wasted fucking points. Just bring it over here.

1268
04:02:24,250 --> 04:02:30,170
He's going to the dragon. He's going to die. He's actually going to die. He has no idea.

1269
04:02:34,659 --> 04:02:55,270
Switch the boat. Come here. Oh, damn it. No, I was right there. No. Oh, fuck. I, oh, whatever.

1270
04:02:55,270 --> 04:03:17,770
Get to do another turn anyways. Oh, you're dead. You're dead. You're dead. We're going to do the

1271
04:03:17,770 --> 04:03:24,809
old switcheroo. Watch this. Put him in this boat. You think it's this person in the boat.

1272
04:03:26,840 --> 04:03:41,590
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Give me all your stuff. What do you have? All right. Now you go on the

1273
04:03:41,590 --> 04:03:45,690
boat and he's going to attack the boat and be like, holy shit. This guy's unbeatable pack. Lots

1274
04:03:45,690 --> 04:03:54,899
thrown. He's got dragons. He has bucket red dragons, but he only has packs of the other ones.

1275
04:04:06,149 --> 04:04:13,530
Wait for him on land. I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do because this is like,

1276
04:04:13,530 --> 04:04:33,379
I could die to save it. I'm just going to go in the boat. He's not, he's going to avoid me.

1277
04:04:34,790 --> 04:04:41,959
Look, this lady's, he's not going to attack. But what if he does? I can't attack him from here.

1278
04:04:42,600 --> 04:04:53,479
He actually is going to the dragon. He doesn't have enough to do that.

1279
04:05:01,110 --> 04:05:11,049
So make sure he doesn't get them. In fact, here, do you want to take these?

1280
04:05:13,719 --> 04:05:19,459
Take these. I just got some more of them. You can have them. Oh, no, no, no. I got them. No,

1281
04:05:19,459 --> 04:05:51,059
nevermind. What do you think? Should I fight it? Should I go for it? Okay. Who is priority here?

1282
04:05:58,360 --> 04:06:02,620
14. That's not that big of a deal. I think that's the only range unit they have.

1283
04:06:03,420 --> 04:06:08,459
180 health. Jesus. This is the one that's going to be the horrible, horrible, horrible problem.

1284
04:06:09,340 --> 04:06:29,420
I don't have curse frost ring lightning bolt 135. Oh my God. I can lightning bolt the dragon

1285
04:06:38,120 --> 04:06:46,040
dragon immune immune to spells one through three. That's horrible. Lightning bolt the centaurs.

1286
04:06:46,760 --> 04:06:56,540
I'm going to lightning bolt the centaurs. I think see if I can kill like 30 of them.

1287
04:06:59,260 --> 04:07:04,469
That's not 30 of them. That's not 30 of them. That was like seven.

1288
04:07:04,469 --> 04:07:12,569
The genie. Who should I buff? I'm going to buff somebody with the genie. Who should I buff?

1289
04:07:13,290 --> 04:07:25,000
Who should be buffed? Um, somebody with range probably. Fire shield. All right.

1290
04:07:25,799 --> 04:07:43,290
Nobody move. Nobody move. Where should I throw this at? Probably the ranged. Get rid of the ranged.

1291
04:07:43,850 --> 04:07:50,200
Ranged. The ranged is gone. Okay. Now I just have to worry about the pegasus and shit.

1292
04:07:51,159 --> 04:08:00,260
All right. You're expendable. Get on the plank. You are also expendable. You go. Oh,

1293
04:08:00,260 --> 04:08:05,700
you should have gone on the other plank. It's just the golems. They're supposed to be doing this.

1294
04:08:10,420 --> 04:08:21,799
Morale going down. Here we go. What does the dragon just fell over and died?

1295
04:08:22,440 --> 04:08:32,940
All right. Here come. Oh no, no, no, no, no, no. Oh, please. Shit. You suck. Oh no. Oh no.

1296
04:08:32,940 --> 04:08:38,299
I think we're good. We're fine. Genie. Who? What's the genie doing? I need to the dragon

1297
04:08:38,299 --> 04:08:52,409
to just sit back here. Uh, kill the dragon. Buff the naga. Frenzy. Oh, how many just died?

1298
04:08:57,049 --> 04:09:07,399
Twelve. No, it's fine. I thought that was 103 died. Just kill the dragon. Holy shit,

1299
04:09:07,399 --> 04:09:24,739
he was pathetic. That was wicked easy. This is the scary part. Oh no, it's not scary at all. I'm

1300
04:09:24,739 --> 04:09:46,870
fucking unbeatable. Unstoppable. Nobody can beat me. It's game over. Doesn't matter. I win.

1301
04:09:50,389 --> 04:10:07,370
4000 experience. You learned ice bolt. Basic sorcery. 5% more damage. I like it. We're good

1302
04:10:07,370 --> 04:10:16,840
to go. Didn't lose very much. I'm going to go sack their kingdom now. Here we go. Is that, oh,

1303
04:10:16,840 --> 04:10:33,690
yeah. Is that red? Oh, you got some, you got some shit over here, don't you? Where do I want to go?

1304
04:10:34,489 --> 04:10:48,260
What's the destination? I wonder. I could kill this. I could go here and clean up this hole.

1305
04:10:48,260 --> 04:10:56,379
I'm going here. Fight the dragons. Um, I'm actually, yeah, I'm going to, I'm going to do,

1306
04:10:56,379 --> 04:11:03,799
I'm going to change this up a little bit here. I don't, I want to get rid of, um, this. I'm not

1307
04:11:03,799 --> 04:11:11,700
going to, uh, I kind of, Nimbus is not going to die. Nimbus is going to be fine because I want

1308
04:11:11,700 --> 04:11:22,979
skeletons. Yeah, I can, I can, let me, let me just transfer and hold on. Come here. Skeletons are

1309
04:11:22,979 --> 04:11:42,899
actually really important. I need a space for them. Okay. I'm ready. Let's go kill the trolls.

1310
04:11:43,860 --> 04:11:52,700
I have a lot of money too. Let's not forget that I should probably be buying things.

1311
04:11:53,420 --> 04:11:56,760
Level four, I don't have any pots, but what about over here?

1312
04:11:57,559 --> 04:12:09,659
Mage go level one. That is required for the city hall. I could just, I could take these and upgrade

1313
04:12:09,659 --> 04:12:30,629
them too. All right. City hall is next. Did he die? I don't think he went in. He didn't go in yet.

1314
04:12:31,430 --> 04:12:43,829
Here we go. Who is here? Trolls. Should I just, is there a reason for me to do this?

1315
04:12:43,829 --> 04:13:04,940
I don't think there's a reason for me to fight this. Well, I'm going to buff the wizards. Slow.

1316
04:13:05,659 --> 04:13:40,620
See? Oh wait, I can, no, I don't, I don't want them though. Damn it. Ah, that's too bad. No,

1317
04:13:40,620 --> 04:13:47,459
I don't want them. Wasn't even worth hiring. I have 80 points now. All right. Let's go claim

1318
04:13:47,459 --> 04:13:54,170
this shit. I'm going to take it. There's a, just this one, there's a bug in here.

1319
04:13:55,610 --> 04:14:09,209
There's a single bug. You can just, oh, am I going to have you do? I don't know. Go defend the other

1320
04:14:09,209 --> 04:14:21,850
one. Go defend this one. Let's go back here and learn some spells and shit. City hall. That's more

1321
04:14:21,850 --> 04:14:31,479
money. I could spend some of this money too. Yeah. She can bring the, she can be the goblin transfer.

1322
04:14:31,479 --> 04:14:37,079
Did that guy even go in there? I think he chickened out. Gold dragon growth plus five

1323
04:14:37,799 --> 04:15:01,319
new week. All right, here we go. Take this castle. 17 bugs. Just get the fuck in there. Thank you.

1324
04:15:01,959 --> 04:15:13,129
Lost a couple of gnomes, but that's fine. Mine. Excellent. Okay. We're going to get a hero here to

1325
04:15:13,129 --> 04:15:25,139
defend and then I'm going to recruit all these people. Pretty sick. That's decent. That's pretty

1326
04:15:25,139 --> 04:15:38,309
decent defense. And we've got level three death knight. Uh, I, yeah. Why can I not recruit you?

1327
04:15:38,309 --> 04:15:52,340
It's because I'm in the way. Call of Valhalla. Let me, let me move out of the way.

1328
04:15:52,899 --> 04:16:10,280
There we go. I've got a good defense here now. We got, uh, let's see. Yep. This is good. I'm going to

1329
04:16:11,239 --> 04:16:22,469
escape town, flee from defending upgrade cliff nest, Thunderbirds. The specialty is

1330
04:16:24,040 --> 04:16:31,110
liches. I don't think I have access to them in here though. Not yet. Cyclops, behemoth, ogre,

1331
04:16:33,750 --> 04:16:43,239
orc tower. I can make more chieftains. Yeah. Let's get it. So upgrade these two chieftains

1332
04:16:43,959 --> 04:17:05,530
two to five, two to five. It's arranged as well. That's good. And you stay there. I do have a pretty

1333
04:17:05,530 --> 04:17:15,079
good supply of these things. Fort requires, uh, let's do, I don't think, no, I can't do it yet.

1334
04:17:15,719 --> 04:17:34,540
I don't, I capital needs. I just need a bunch of fucking ore. What is it to make the, um, I need a

1335
04:17:34,540 --> 04:17:46,219
fort. No, I'm kind of behind. All right. I have secured island in the middle. I'm ready to get in

1336
04:17:46,219 --> 04:17:55,909
the boat. This is protected. I don't have a problem here. I'm ready to keep going. You are on your way

1337
04:17:55,909 --> 04:18:07,530
to this castle over here. Don't stop. Thank you. Isn't there somebody? Okay. You're still in here.

1338
04:18:07,530 --> 04:18:29,370
This castle is now also defended and protected completely in a good spot. Taxes. You headed here.

1339
04:18:29,370 --> 04:18:56,090
Get the, this way. You're good. Cloud temple. I need this. I've just, give me more wood. Come here.

1340
04:18:56,090 --> 04:19:02,379
All right. Here's my thought process here. Yeah. I'm going to wipe this up. Purple's done. This is

1341
04:19:02,379 --> 04:19:12,790
purple's base. It's over. I'm claiming this land. You're about to lose. I'm about to take over purple.

1342
04:19:12,790 --> 04:19:29,079
Can't do anything else. Everything is fortified. Yeah, you're running. We just came out. Okay.

1343
04:19:29,959 --> 04:19:35,370
I'm not concerned at all, but I am going to save it because, you know, why not?

1344
04:19:36,090 --> 04:19:51,510
We've already seen this. I will take that. Thank you. It's a one a day. I'm going right on your

1345
04:19:51,510 --> 04:20:24,059
front door. Take the castle. Okay. They've got the unicorns. They've got not very, this is not that

1346
04:20:24,059 --> 04:20:32,139
bad. It's just a question of getting rid of these. Destroy undead. Don't have any undead.

1347
04:20:33,030 --> 04:20:41,909
Air shield. I feel like I could give this to somebody or maybe I should just blood lust

1348
04:20:44,420 --> 04:21:04,200
lightning bolt, ice bolt, force field, lightning bolt. I wonder if I should just lightning bolt

1349
04:21:04,200 --> 04:21:18,329
the archers here. Just see what it does. It's pretty good. I'm going to buff. Who do I want

1350
04:21:18,329 --> 04:21:24,979
to buff here? Probably the one of the ranged, probably like the mage or the, yeah, the mage,

1351
04:21:24,979 --> 04:21:38,549
I think prayer. Okay. The gargoyles can get in. I can get in for the gargoyle. I wonder if I should

1352
04:21:38,549 --> 04:21:49,350
get in. Not right now. What I'm saying, like jump over in a minute, get in, hit and get out.

1353
04:21:49,909 --> 04:22:07,479
I wonder if it's something I should do. I'm going to try it. Mages. Holy shit. That was devastating.

1354
04:22:08,040 --> 04:22:19,909
I cannot get in with the naga. So I'm just going to hold. They so desperately want to get review.

1355
04:22:20,469 --> 04:22:26,920
Nobody else can do anything. I'm going to put people up in front though.

1356
04:22:29,579 --> 04:22:35,340
Skeletons just get up here and just take damage. Can I come out the front door?

1357
04:22:36,219 --> 04:22:48,950
They're coming out. He's coming out the front door. Brave. I did not expect that. I thought

1358
04:22:48,950 --> 04:22:52,870
they were going to stay in the walls. They're coming outside. Okay. This just got a little

1359
04:22:52,870 --> 04:23:07,930
more hairy. I'm staying with Clint. Okay. Now I'm going to buff the naga. Buff naga. Okay.

1360
04:23:07,930 --> 04:23:32,299
Naga is buffed. Now I'm going in. Fuck it. Let's go. Got it. Okay. Dwarves, I think. Yeah.

1361
04:23:32,299 --> 04:23:41,100
This is, these are so powerful when you have a stack of them. Let's see if I can wipe this out.

1362
04:23:49,750 --> 04:23:56,629
Holy shit. That was insane. I can't get cocky though because all it takes is

1363
04:24:00,649 --> 04:24:06,940
thousand damage. Good. I'm sticking. I'm going to, I'm going to just, I don't know.

1364
04:24:07,739 --> 04:24:16,940
I kind of have to just, just fight it. It's in front of you. I'm going to lose all the gremlins.

1365
04:24:20,440 --> 04:24:33,959
Reinforce. Wow. These guys are so strong. Okay. Here come the centaurs.

1366
04:24:36,120 --> 04:25:06,620
Good to go again. Not good. Holy fuck.

1367
04:25:12,649 --> 04:25:21,819
I can taste victory. I can smell it. There's only a few things left. I'm going to get the castle.

1368
04:25:23,049 --> 04:25:30,600
Purple is no more. I can't go anywhere. So I'm just going to hang out right here.

1369
04:25:31,479 --> 04:25:39,670
This thing is very strong. Oh, I think it's like stone skin.

1370
04:25:41,479 --> 04:25:52,739
Don't want to lose any more of you. Yeah. Having this many. These, these are, they're upgraded too.

1371
04:25:53,700 --> 04:26:07,829
Can I go for a one hit kill? What do you think? Oh, no, that was a bad idea.

1372
04:26:08,629 --> 04:26:17,219
Oh, that was a really bad idea. That was a bad, bad idea. This thing is so strong. It's okay.

1373
04:26:17,219 --> 04:26:51,180
It's almost done. Kill it. Why are you so strong? No. The siege.

1374
04:26:58,489 --> 04:27:13,700
The battle has been won. Almost 10,000 experience. Lost 165 gremlins, 73 gargoyles, 10 magicians,

1375
04:27:13,700 --> 04:27:27,670
eight genies, two naga queens, seven skeletons. You have captured an enemy artifact, the tome

1376
04:27:27,670 --> 04:27:33,510
of earth magic. This heavy book contains all spells in the school of earth magic.

1377
04:27:34,149 --> 04:27:43,129
It must be equipped for those spells to be available. Expert wisdom or advanced sorcery.

1378
04:27:47,399 --> 04:28:01,030
Level spells, 10% more damage. Get to go again. Knowledge plus one, advanced logistics,

1379
04:28:01,909 --> 04:28:12,299
20% more movement speed. Damn. Advanced offense, all hand to hand by 20% more damage.

1380
04:28:15,299 --> 04:28:31,299
Claimed. Mara Shen. Look at this place. Thank you. I appreciate it. We're decking this place out.

1381
04:28:31,860 --> 04:28:43,940
You already have a castle. You don't have a capital yet. Wait, do we have a capital?

1382
04:28:43,940 --> 04:28:51,559
Is this thing already, what's this? Mystic pond. Produce a small random number of resources every

1383
04:28:51,559 --> 04:29:13,959
week. Yeah, give it to me. I need to get in there. No recruits left. So there's green dragon that's

1384
04:29:13,959 --> 04:29:20,360
available soon. I'm gonna have you defend here for a little bit because I mean I just did this.

1385
04:29:24,340 --> 04:29:34,139
Purple probably has one more stronghold that's down here. How many skeletons did I get for that?

1386
04:29:36,950 --> 04:29:47,850
85 skeletons. That's a lot. I'm not confident with this group though because I just lost so many.

1387
04:29:53,290 --> 04:29:57,450
Maybe hire a new hero to take care of this place. I have a lot of just strongholds.

1388
04:29:59,290 --> 04:30:19,909
I have to click on this one. You stay here. I want to have somebody available in each base.

1389
04:30:21,270 --> 04:30:32,760
Here's the book. Where can the book go? The book has to replace something.

1390
04:30:33,559 --> 04:30:47,020
Wait, does it? Yeah, it does. Okay, so you got this bone cruiser archery skill by 5%.

1391
04:30:47,979 --> 04:30:51,899
That's nothing. Bang. We now know every single earth spell in the game.

1392
04:30:52,860 --> 04:31:05,620
I want to know what they look like. Oh my god. What? Allow you to summon earth elementals. Once

1393
04:31:05,620 --> 04:31:15,770
cast, no other elemental may be summoned. This almost feels like hacks. Cheat codes. Implosion.

1394
04:31:16,329 --> 04:31:25,690
It inflicts massive damage to a single creature stack. Meteor shower. Resurrection. This is insane.

1395
04:31:25,690 --> 04:31:39,290
Sorrow. Well, I think that's our... I think we win. I need to get some more here. I gotta get more

1396
04:31:39,290 --> 04:31:47,479
units here. That was a major victory, but we suffered major losses. Let's continue the

1397
04:31:47,479 --> 04:31:52,709
exploration down here. How much money do I got? Can I do anything? I need to get these goddamn

1398
04:31:53,590 --> 04:32:18,549
giants. 10, 10, 10. I'm gonna be getting a lot of income though. I could trade the gems. Yeah,

1399
04:32:18,549 --> 04:32:41,030
I could, but that's not very much. I guess it is. Gems for wood. 10, 20 gems. Let's get more. 10

1400
04:32:41,030 --> 04:33:08,169
more. So I have... no, hold on. So that means 24 wood. I need 10 ore, which I don't have.

1401
04:33:08,970 --> 04:33:22,970
I have four. I have six. All right, let's get those fucking giants.

1402
04:33:28,490 --> 04:33:45,740
Giants. 150 health, 40 to 60 damage. Oh, I need gems to recruit. I can only recruit one a week.

1403
04:33:49,099 --> 04:34:04,009
Well, time to start the collection of two per week. Let me take a look at them again. Mind spell

1404
04:34:04,009 --> 04:34:10,549
immunity. They're very, very expensive. All right, I don't need them this second. I just want to make

1405
04:34:10,549 --> 04:34:16,299
sure I could get them. That leaves us with... I have 14 wood, which is enough. What's something

1406
04:34:16,299 --> 04:34:33,619
else I want to do? No, what was the other thing I wanted to do before I left? Upgrade the cliff

1407
04:34:33,619 --> 04:34:47,290
nest. I need... what do I need for this? Five more ore, which I have. Five... what do I miss in here?

1408
04:34:51,740 --> 04:34:59,799
Can't afford it. Oh, okay, I do need five. I need five ore. I was looking down here for some reason.

1409
04:35:00,759 --> 04:35:11,880
All right, let's get some ore. What do I have to trade? Crystals. How many do I need? Five or ten?

1410
04:35:12,680 --> 04:35:36,619
Did I not go... oh, shit, right. I didn't shake the hand. Cliff nest. Thunderbirds. Golden birds. Nice.

1411
04:35:36,619 --> 04:35:56,229
All right, so 15 health, 60. What's the difference? Speed. Chief. Gold birds. Lightning strike. Oh,

1412
04:35:56,229 --> 04:36:01,029
that's different. Okay, cool. I think I'm in a pretty good spot. I think I'm in a pretty good

1413
04:36:01,029 --> 04:36:16,659
spot right now. I'm pretty confident. Let's get this stuff claimed again. More gold. Get this homestead.

1414
04:36:17,380 --> 04:36:31,880
Want that. Okay, what have we got? Still the same weak lookout tower. I mean, I could just build it

1415
04:36:31,880 --> 04:36:43,130
just because. But no, that's precious wood. Let's do another upgrade to this one here. Cyclops cave.

1416
04:36:43,770 --> 04:36:57,479
I need the ogre fort. 20 wood. 20 and 20. Two things that I don't have.

1417
04:36:59,000 --> 04:37:18,459
I mean, it's gonna wipe me out, but let's get eight. And then what about this? This is not

1418
04:37:18,459 --> 04:37:40,490
bad exchange right now. What do I need? Three. I mean, 20 and 20, right? Fuck, I need money.

1419
04:37:47,380 --> 04:37:59,400
I don't have any favorable. No, it's all good. I'll just wait. We're not at the end of the week yet. I

1420
04:37:59,400 --> 04:38:05,259
can afford it. Tax day. Tax day is coming up. Not right now. I still have a couple of days.

1421
04:38:11,750 --> 04:38:22,419
16,000. No, wrong place. Upgrade the ogre fort. No, this is a regular fort.

1422
04:38:23,369 --> 04:38:45,459
From where is it here? All right. Yeah. Just try to come get me now. All right, that's good.

1423
04:38:46,860 --> 04:38:51,610
You are continuing your path. I've already done this. What do I have for points?

1424
04:38:51,610 --> 04:39:01,419
Upgraded my points. There's the Dwarven treasury. It's been deserted. I've been to the obelisk

1425
04:39:01,419 --> 04:39:11,720
already, but I'm gonna take another turn. Do I have enough pieces? No. All right. Uncharted

1426
04:39:11,720 --> 04:39:16,860
territory for the first time. The warrior's tomb. Do I wish to search the tomb? I do.

1427
04:39:19,049 --> 04:39:42,790
Oh no, that's not good. What happened? Did I just get super morale decrease? Sulfur. Very bad morale.

1428
04:39:43,750 --> 04:39:57,319
Minus three from the warrior tomb. Dicks. All right, what have I got? This is the last day

1429
04:39:57,319 --> 04:40:05,939
before the new week in taxes, so let me see if I can build something. I need to spend this money.

1430
04:40:06,500 --> 04:40:21,619
What about this new town? Maybe I should save money. Fountain of Fortune. Enchanted Springs.

1431
04:40:22,419 --> 04:40:38,180
Ooh. Yeah, let's get it. Which is silver pegasi. All right, here comes a new week.

1432
04:40:38,900 --> 04:40:59,990
Notice how purple is painful. Like the rabbit. Move you around. Plus one luck for the next battle.

1433
04:40:59,990 --> 04:41:17,270
There's another. Uh-oh. This is purple's last defense. Ammo carts. Unlimited ammunition.

1434
04:41:18,069 --> 04:41:24,540
Should I get the ammunition one? Do I already have one of these? I don't know if I'm confident to

1435
04:41:24,540 --> 04:41:36,389
get in there. Get the tent. I think I already have one. Just get it, yeah. I've got everything,

1436
04:41:36,389 --> 04:41:47,770
though. Um, you've got several. Lots. Lots. Pack several. Few. It might not be a good idea.

1437
04:41:47,770 --> 04:41:53,430
I could probably do it, but I don't have the range, I don't think. I'm not confident.

1438
04:41:59,779 --> 04:42:11,849
But I do have money and we have a ton of new recruits. Oh, you have every earth spell. Yeah,

1439
04:42:11,849 --> 04:42:19,880
that's true. I could just like earthquake them. Should I delete these? Yeah, just dismiss these

1440
04:42:19,880 --> 04:42:40,099
idiots. Or yeah, just get out of here. Here we go. 26,003 to get all this stuff. This is turning

1441
04:42:40,099 --> 04:42:43,860
into another great army. There's three giants. What does it take to upgrade the giants?

1442
04:42:45,880 --> 04:42:57,060
25,030. I can do this in another turn or two. I'll be able to do it. I'll have unstoppable units.

1443
04:42:57,779 --> 04:43:09,189
Let's just recruit everybody just to do it. Yeah, bring them all in. Oh, okay, hold on. Wait.

1444
04:43:10,700 --> 04:43:17,560
Skeletons. No, that's good. I'm running out of money, though.

1445
04:43:24,619 --> 04:43:34,580
Oh, here's the taxes. What are you doing over here? He's coming for blood. I think he's coming.

1446
04:43:34,580 --> 04:44:05,400
He's going for it. I think he's going for it. I need to upgrade somebody. I have chieftains,

1447
04:44:05,400 --> 04:44:17,860
wolf riders, or hobgoblins. No, I already have a wolf pen. 1,005 and five. I need some more wood.

1448
04:44:22,979 --> 04:44:32,819
Terrible exchange. Awful exchange, right? This is bad. I'm gonna need five, so I have what? Two.

1449
04:44:51,430 --> 04:44:58,470
Do I have enough money to do this? 1,400. All right, they are now wolf raiders.

1450
04:44:59,349 --> 04:45:09,130
I'm gonna lose the talent. I might not. I may not. This is a really good defense.

1451
04:45:10,090 --> 04:45:22,889
This game's 20 years old and it holds up really well. Yeah, it's just the classic,

1452
04:45:23,610 --> 04:45:33,180
you know? It's just a very, very, very fun game. You can go so elaborate with this game. I mean,

1453
04:45:34,139 --> 04:45:40,090
sorry, keep bumping the mic. This is, I think, four players in a medium-sized map. You can do

1454
04:45:40,090 --> 04:45:46,569
extra large with eight people and you can put it on very fucking hard. I saved, see? Look.

1455
04:45:47,209 --> 04:45:53,299
I'll do it again. See, right now I have the difficulty on normal. The map difficulty is

1456
04:45:53,299 --> 04:45:59,849
normal and then I have like the player difficulty on like, what's that, like one notch up,

1457
04:45:59,849 --> 04:46:11,130
essentially. You can really just bring it up or down. You can make the game real fucking hard.

1458
04:46:11,770 --> 04:46:27,299
I wonder if I should go for this. Let me just see what's down here. All right, there's a mine.

1459
04:46:27,299 --> 04:46:32,549
There's a couple of things. I'm just gonna go outside his front door. I'm gonna take everything

1460
04:46:32,549 --> 04:46:43,270
in his front door. Would you like to recruit centaurs? 14 centaurs join your army. I didn't

1461
04:46:43,270 --> 04:46:51,430
mean that to be like a horse, but like, I mean, I'll take them. I had a spot for him. I'm right

1462
04:46:51,430 --> 04:47:04,549
outside of his door. I'm just waiting out here. All right, here comes a fight because you look

1463
04:47:04,549 --> 04:47:08,549
like you're coming over here. How are we doing? We're all right. We got enough at least for a

1464
04:47:08,549 --> 04:47:17,340
standoff here. Take it. I can't move anymore. I have to wait till next turn. Let's see what he does.

1465
04:47:17,900 --> 04:47:28,040
There he comes. He's going for it. He's coming with everything he has. This is his entire army.

1466
04:47:28,040 --> 04:47:34,389
He's pissed. We took his city and now he's like, fuck this. I'm coming with 300 centaurs.

1467
04:47:35,290 --> 04:48:01,400
Uh, all right. Death ripple. Curse bloodlust. Curse. Disrupting ray. I could do bloodlust or

1468
04:48:01,400 --> 04:48:16,599
just lightning bolt. Throw curse. Yeah. Curse the archers. Curse the archer. But they're gonna just

1469
04:48:16,599 --> 04:48:21,959
gonna fly in. I think he's gonna take the castle. Maybe not. Curse the archers so they don't do any

1470
04:48:21,959 --> 04:48:39,259
damage. And then I just gotta, I gotta sit in here. I can't go anywhere. I can't just jump out there.

1471
04:48:44,869 --> 04:48:51,029
No. That's too many centaurs. Hopefully at least the archers will take care of it.

1472
04:48:52,310 --> 04:49:04,580
Do I even have any ranged at all? I don't think I have any. Besides the towers. Well,

1473
04:49:04,580 --> 04:49:08,659
they're gonna make their way over here. I wish I could just throw an axe at you.

1474
04:49:14,220 --> 04:49:25,209
No. Hurts. Okay. No, this is ranged. This is ranged. It's an axe thrower. Ugh. I don't know.

1475
04:49:25,209 --> 04:49:34,860
Right, the front door. Try to just throw. Or should I go for the archer? This is gonna be,

1476
04:49:35,580 --> 04:50:08,020
it's not great. But once she gets in, she's gonna fly over the gate. Fuck. Come on. No.

1477
04:50:08,740 --> 04:50:17,659
The gates have been breached. This is bad. Gates are open. All right. It's time. I'm gonna go

1478
04:50:17,659 --> 04:50:39,000
bloodlust. Either bloodlust or earth magic. This is not the same person. This is a different person.

1479
04:50:39,819 --> 04:50:48,630
Different hero. Am I out of mana? No, that's not good. Can I do anything? I'm fucked.

1480
04:50:50,220 --> 04:50:56,889
Ah, I have to just go out and start fighting. Who do I want to try to take out first?

1481
04:51:02,549 --> 04:51:09,880
It's not completely over yet. Not yet. Really the only real major scary thing is this guy and this

1482
04:51:09,880 --> 04:51:23,189
guy. And the archers too. I gotta go in. It's 57 trees. Yeah, this is bad. Well, at least I put up

1483
04:51:23,189 --> 04:51:30,060
a defense. I'm gonna just gonna fly in and see if we can take out some of the centaurs. Damage

1484
04:51:30,060 --> 04:51:40,360
through health. I mean, these things are good. They're trying to kill the thunderbirds immediately.

1485
04:51:45,779 --> 04:51:48,900
I could probably take out a bunch of these though. There's so many of them.

1486
04:51:50,459 --> 04:52:05,689
Ah. I could fly up here and just go for the archers. But I can only fly this far. See if I can

1487
04:52:05,689 --> 04:52:14,389
make something happen. All right, you didn't like that. Holy shit. That was not good. All right.

1488
04:52:18,299 --> 04:52:39,189
Just get the fuck out here. Game over. Ah. I can't hurt... I can't do anything.

1489
04:52:39,830 --> 04:52:43,189
You got... You can't hurt everything. Might as well just whack this thing.

1490
04:52:44,229 --> 04:53:01,209
No. They don't stand a chance. Why do they have to piss purple off?

1491
04:53:02,819 --> 04:53:08,630
Well, I don't mind losing this because it's not like there's a lot here.

1492
04:53:09,990 --> 04:53:16,220
I can get it back. Plus, dude, I'm about to go destroy his whole... He's only gonna have one place.

1493
04:53:17,180 --> 04:53:26,709
He spends all of his money to get his revenge and that's fine. I could care less. I'm standing

1494
04:53:26,709 --> 04:53:41,369
outside his front door. I just bought this guy yesterday. See, look at this. Several few lots,

1495
04:53:41,369 --> 04:53:50,569
pack several, pack few. I think I can get in there. And then I have this down here and this

1496
04:53:50,569 --> 04:53:57,340
is definitely decked out. This place has to be. I got all the best spells in the game. Let's go for

1497
04:53:57,340 --> 04:54:15,189
it. Oh, that did a lot of damage. All right, here we go. Earth. Earth elemental or implosion.

1498
04:54:15,189 --> 04:54:23,770
Should I implode the dragon? I'm gonna fucking implode the dragon. Excuse me. Sorry, but I'm

1499
04:54:23,770 --> 04:54:34,740
about to kill at least two of you. That does so much damage and two of them have been removed.

1500
04:54:35,380 --> 04:54:42,889
That's how you can tell that this thing is fucking crazy. I'm all right with this, though. I got

1501
04:54:42,889 --> 04:54:47,529
a good... What's the damage on... I wonder if I should buff somebody. Let's just go in.

1502
04:54:50,419 --> 04:55:00,330
They don't do that much damage. 13 to 16, not worth it. Haste on the mage. What the hell are

1503
04:55:00,330 --> 04:55:03,299
you doing to me? Come on, come on out the front door. I'm gonna kill the dragon before you get

1504
04:55:03,299 --> 04:55:11,900
out of here. Fucking morale. Whatever. All right, beat him up. Punch him right in the face.

1505
04:55:11,900 --> 04:55:18,889
Go for the dragons? Or should I just remove the... Go for the dragon. Everybody. Everybody

1506
04:55:18,889 --> 04:55:30,330
focus on the dragons. I'm so glad these skeletons are just taking the damage here. They're just

1507
04:55:30,330 --> 04:55:42,169
eating this. Thank God. They ate that whole thing. All right, Genie. You gotta get one hit. That's

1508
04:55:42,169 --> 04:55:56,500
all I ask. Hit one time. One hit. Yes. The immediate threat is not the unicorn. I think it's... Is it

1509
04:55:56,500 --> 04:56:08,619
the unicorn? I don't know. Is it the... The Medusa's probably? Got it. All right, I gotta get the

1510
04:56:08,619 --> 04:56:30,500
gargoyles up front. You did... That was a big mistake. Front door not open. All right, let's

1511
04:56:30,500 --> 04:56:46,459
implode. There's more danger, I see. Let's see. Three to seven. Two to three. Let's... I'm just...

1512
04:56:46,459 --> 04:57:15,419
I'm gonna implode the archers. I have taken your castle. It's mine. With minimal loss. Overkill.

1513
04:57:15,419 --> 04:57:26,939
I wanted to like assert my dominance here. Genie should end this in one hit. Nimbus versus the

1514
04:57:26,939 --> 04:57:35,560
gold dragons. Didn't... I lost a bunch of skeletons, but here we go. Let's see how decked out this

1515
04:57:35,560 --> 04:57:52,700
place is. Holy shit. Hey, thanks. Thanks for like the decked out house. Castle. Fountain of Fortune.

1516
04:57:55,180 --> 04:58:06,310
Enchanted Springs. Unicorn glade. War unicorns. Yep. Yeah, thanks for the house. And thanks for the

1517
04:58:07,189 --> 04:58:11,450
new hero that I'm going to have that is going to be decked out. Who's it going to be?

1518
04:58:12,169 --> 04:58:29,990
Out Mr. Heretic. Probably the heretic. So I don't care if I lost that place. Basic pathfinding has

1519
04:58:29,990 --> 04:58:39,909
been found out. Chris's morale. Finally I get some more stuff to claim. Two wood a day. Thank God.

1520
04:58:40,950 --> 04:58:50,659
Now let's get another hero. The heretic. And let's at least recruit a bunch of these.

1521
04:58:51,459 --> 04:59:04,580
I have a gold dragon now. Pretty awesome. Where are we in the week? I have no money now.

1522
04:59:04,580 --> 04:59:11,479
Purple has holed up here. Look at this. Is that? No, that's my boat. I'm gonna say where's purple?

1523
04:59:14,040 --> 04:59:17,799
I think it's time to bring out the... Let me get some more money first.

1524
04:59:18,599 --> 04:59:24,419
Let's see where the purple has one remaining boat coming this way.

1525
04:59:24,419 --> 04:59:37,930
Hey. You motherfucker. I'm coming to take my castle back. No, you're not. In fact,

1526
04:59:37,930 --> 04:59:44,599
I'm going to hang out here because I'm stacking this place. A thousand experience. That's good.

1527
04:59:45,939 --> 04:59:53,450
Centaur stables. What does that lead to? Yeah, I'll take some centaurs. Check out the windmill.

1528
04:59:53,450 --> 05:00:00,889
All right. Let's just hang out over here. I got 12,000 gold. Let's get a bunch of stuff.

1529
05:00:01,770 --> 05:00:12,090
It's like imps kind of taking up space here. You know what? Here, I'll trade you next week.

1530
05:00:15,380 --> 05:00:26,790
Blue keeps on going back and forth to the dragon cave. What are you doing? Should I go over there

1531
05:00:26,790 --> 05:00:31,270
or should I not go over there? I don't know. Should I go? Should I stay? He's coming back.

1532
05:00:32,069 --> 05:00:37,979
I'm gonna have to wait for him here. He's gonna come back. I'm just gonna get some money.

1533
05:00:38,700 --> 05:00:48,090
Here he comes. Oh, wait a minute. He went the other way. Oh, fuck. I forgot about this castle.

1534
05:00:48,090 --> 05:01:02,779
He went the other direction. Oh, no. He got word from the scouts. They only got one person. Oh,

1535
05:01:02,779 --> 05:01:17,740
you fucking idiot. God damn it. You're dead, man. I completely fucking forgot. Oh, that sucks.

1536
05:01:24,229 --> 05:01:33,349
I just have to get a decent group together here. Come here. Let me give the...

1537
05:01:34,069 --> 05:01:45,540
Come here. That's his only force. He's just taking it all over the world. Okay. I want...

1538
05:01:47,099 --> 05:01:54,680
I'm sending you... Hold on. Let me look at this. You get out of here for a minute.

1539
05:01:54,680 --> 05:02:15,049
I need to look. Let's see. What's better? Send Nimbus home to restock. It just takes so long.

1540
05:02:15,049 --> 05:02:23,029
I'm on the other side of the world at this point. It's empty now. He just... He's leaving every

1541
05:02:23,029 --> 05:02:29,270
castle empty. I have like five castles and like four... The one he attacks is the one that doesn't

1542
05:02:29,270 --> 05:02:44,119
have fucking things in it. Everything else... Look it. Everywhere else has stuff. He's just hanging

1543
05:02:44,119 --> 05:02:54,279
out over here. You're a pain in my ass. Maybe we should just both go get him. Meet him on the open

1544
05:02:54,279 --> 05:03:05,720
field. Not yet. I need to like have the correct... Shit. I'm gonna recruit all these fucking people.

1545
05:03:07,750 --> 05:03:18,619
Here we go. All right. Bang. 93 centaur captains. That's really good. Let me see what you got on

1546
05:03:18,619 --> 05:03:26,840
you. You got like this... I'm just gonna send you to like your death. I definitely want the dragon

1547
05:03:28,889 --> 05:03:34,619
and the centaur captains. It's the imps. The imps are fucking this whole thing up.

1548
05:03:35,259 --> 05:03:54,680
All right. Come here. I'm dumping the imps. We're both going up there. You guys just stay here.

1549
05:03:56,250 --> 05:04:08,020
93 captains. Now what do we have here? Centaurs... I'm gonna trade him the centaur captains.

1550
05:04:08,020 --> 05:04:21,430
So he has 93 captains. 16 naga queens. Should I trade out the skeletons for the dragon?

1551
05:04:21,430 --> 05:04:34,840
Skeletons for the dragon or skeletons for the pegasus? I feel like I really want the pegasus

1552
05:04:34,840 --> 05:04:47,610
though. But what do I give up? The golems? Trinket's a good... Golems are a good wall

1553
05:04:47,610 --> 05:04:53,259
though. But now I have the centaur captains. Wait. Hold on. Let me look. Damage 2 to 3. Health 10,

1554
05:04:53,259 --> 05:05:06,220
12. I mean, not that much. They're not that great. It's not worth using a slot for one unit.

1555
05:05:07,020 --> 05:05:15,979
No, but I mean it's got 250 health. There are 93 centaur captains in here and they all have 10

1556
05:05:15,979 --> 05:05:20,500
health. You know what I mean? Like I need like two or three dragons and it's immune to spells.

1557
05:05:21,139 --> 05:05:36,939
There's 93 of them though. The archers too would be good. They have pretty good damage.

1558
05:05:46,330 --> 05:05:49,849
This is an unbelievable unit. This is an unbelievable unit.

1559
05:05:50,889 --> 05:06:12,340
The gargoyles probably for the trance. Does this... We need... We got range here.

1560
05:06:12,659 --> 05:06:26,810
Send in Kallad to soften them up. We're gonna go together. All right. Yeah. We're gonna send

1561
05:06:26,810 --> 05:06:34,900
in like this little imp first. He's gonna take out like four of them. He's gonna take out a bunch of

1562
05:06:34,900 --> 05:06:41,479
them and then I'm gonna... Like dad's gonna come in and clean it up. I think that's good as it is.

1563
05:06:48,619 --> 05:06:55,720
All right. Out of money. I'm ready for the actual purple battle because then these... Look at

1564
05:06:55,720 --> 05:07:01,639
they both these castles are empty. He's got nobody there. Not one person. Not one person.

1565
05:07:01,639 --> 05:07:11,580
He's just a riding castle. He's riding around with the castle on his back. It's time. Soften

1566
05:07:11,580 --> 05:07:38,970
him up. Let's go. Uh oh. Blue's coming in. Here we go. He's coming down here.

1567
05:07:43,400 --> 05:07:48,119
This is it for purple. It is because look it. Blue's coming in to take this free castle and

1568
05:07:48,119 --> 05:07:55,740
then this is it. Purple will be wiped out from the game. Purple is not going to exist anymore

1569
05:07:55,740 --> 05:08:04,490
after this. There's gonna be three people left. Do you have any of this shit? I don't think he

1570
05:08:04,490 --> 05:08:15,259
even has this. It's just fine to take one. Wait. Hold on. Do you have... All right. Just soften

1571
05:08:15,259 --> 05:08:24,520
them up. You'll be good. I'm going in. All right. I have like these these two booger enemies.

1572
05:08:25,560 --> 05:08:34,360
I'm gonna hang out back here just for a minute because like I... What if he doesn't... Somebody's

1573
05:08:34,360 --> 05:08:37,479
gonna come from the other side and take this castle. All right. There goes that one.

1574
05:08:41,720 --> 05:08:50,630
Wait. There's an energy elemental grove. Is that purple? What the fuck are you doing over here?

1575
05:08:50,630 --> 05:09:00,360
Where does purple have another castle? Down here? No. Impossible. All right. Go fucking go get him.

1576
05:09:01,000 --> 05:09:28,150
You're good. He's not gonna come back. Creeping up. Let's go. Blue is down. Brown has just been

1577
05:09:28,150 --> 05:09:38,889
in the top left. There's the taxes. Okay. You dick. Save the game. Go get him.

1578
05:09:40,740 --> 05:10:04,659
Purple does not have anything left. All right. Let's go. Charge. You want to go? It's time to go.

1579
05:10:06,169 --> 05:10:11,770
Hypnotize. Put an enemy unit temporarily under your control. I don't even have enough points

1580
05:10:11,770 --> 05:10:32,470
for this. Do you have any points? Ice bolt. Ice bolt on the archers. You just open the front door.

1581
05:10:32,790 --> 05:10:46,389
What a mistake. I'm going... Should I... I'm going in? This wasn't even worth doing. I can't soften

1582
05:10:46,389 --> 05:11:23,990
him up. He's got like about 500 people. It's because he's in the castle too. Damn it. You just...

1583
05:11:25,990 --> 05:11:36,139
Damn it. I need like a fucking... I need like a thousand people. I need more like range and...

1584
05:11:42,680 --> 05:11:58,099
I need a ton of archers. I need to stack ranged on somebody. Who do we have here? We have more units.

1585
05:11:58,099 --> 05:12:05,990
I got two more dragons. Okay. I got more dragons. More archers. I'm just gonna play

1586
05:12:05,990 --> 05:12:14,360
the turtle game for a minute here. Look at all this too. I gotta start to get this out here.

1587
05:12:15,000 --> 05:12:27,139
Delete the booger units. Yeah. I'm just... Get rid of these things. You guys suck. Get out of here.

1588
05:12:29,720 --> 05:12:54,180
Yeah. Goodbye. All right. Come back. Everybody back. Back it up. This way. Where does this go?

1589
05:12:55,060 --> 05:13:08,150
One-way entrance. What does that monolith exit end up? I can teleport? I have teleport?

1590
05:13:08,869 --> 05:13:17,580
Oh, this is all earth. Town portal. The nearest friendly town. The town must be unoccupied.

1591
05:13:19,380 --> 05:13:40,229
Oh my god. View earth. I mean... All right. Hold on. This is important. You... All right. I gotta...

1592
05:13:40,229 --> 05:13:51,740
Just... New turn. I gotta get everybody in buildings because I don't want to teleport you here

1593
05:13:51,819 --> 05:14:04,139
because you're right next to it. They exit to the one that's orange up here. Yeah, but that... I

1594
05:14:04,139 --> 05:14:17,560
don't want to be up here. All right. I gotta get a plan. The plan is I need to get you in this building.

1595
05:14:18,360 --> 05:14:35,720
Nobody attack me, please. Okay. You have to get in here. First of all, let's get this correct.

1596
05:14:37,060 --> 05:14:45,020
Three dragons. Sixty. Okay. I've got a little group of, like, idiots.

1597
05:14:49,159 --> 05:14:58,659
I'm gonna stack them all. So do I just... What do you have? Yeah. Bring them... Just bring them all

1598
05:14:58,659 --> 05:15:26,520
back. Bring them all back. Because I need to... Come here. There we go. 123, 19. Now you get the

1599
05:15:26,520 --> 05:15:36,819
fuck back in here like that. You're not... I know. I know. You must delete the skeletons.

1600
05:15:37,779 --> 05:15:51,299
All right. 44 arches. I just need to... I need to think about this for a second.

1601
05:15:53,400 --> 05:16:05,450
You've got... Pegasus are really good. Maybe trade the iron golems at this point.

1602
05:16:06,900 --> 05:16:16,099
So now I can teleport to the nearest town, which is here, I think. Because I get in here and I

1603
05:16:16,099 --> 05:16:27,220
remove this hero from the town, right? And actually, no, I don't want him to... I don't

1604
05:16:27,220 --> 05:16:35,060
want him to go here. There's nothing here worth taking. The nearest town is the one you're at.

1605
05:16:35,700 --> 05:16:41,799
Yeah, but it didn't say that... That as long as this town must be unoccupied,

1606
05:16:42,439 --> 05:16:46,520
teleport to the nearest friendly town, the town must be unoccupied. So if a town is occupied,

1607
05:16:46,520 --> 05:16:55,139
will it take me to the next one? That's not how it works. Will that work? Yeah, you just take

1608
05:16:55,139 --> 05:17:00,659
a hero out, right? So I want to go here because there's a lot... Yeah, I gotta get up here. Look

1609
05:17:00,659 --> 05:17:10,840
at all these recruits. All right, so first action of teleportation is this. We're going up here.

1610
05:17:12,630 --> 05:17:24,389
There's giants here too. There's... All right, I gotta fucking think about this shit. You... Okay.

1611
05:17:25,500 --> 05:17:32,299
Will you go into this town? This one is also occupied. They all are, right? Unoccupied,

1612
05:17:32,299 --> 05:17:52,970
occupied, occupied. Cast a spell. Town portal. Stop. Take the units out too. Okay, I'm out.

1613
05:17:56,459 --> 05:18:20,409
Spell. Town portal. Here we go. Save it. All right. Town portal. Here we go. What? Too tired. Oh,

1614
05:18:20,409 --> 05:18:28,229
he's coming down. He's ignoring me. Okay. Town portal. Do you want to teleport to the Emerald

1615
05:18:28,229 --> 05:18:34,900
Moor? Which one is that? No, I don't want to teleport here. God damn it. Do I actually have

1616
05:18:34,900 --> 05:18:53,430
to go all the way over here? That's... I have to actually travel that far? Shit. Put a hero in front

1617
05:18:53,430 --> 05:19:11,099
of the town. You mean like... Wait, what is this? One... Lot and lot. I could get it right now.

1618
05:19:11,819 --> 05:19:18,729
So you said what you're saying. If I go in here and I go like this...

1619
05:19:20,250 --> 05:19:32,150
Let's see what happens. Okay, so he's selected. Nearest town occupied. Spell failed. Yeah,

1620
05:19:32,150 --> 05:19:46,200
unfortunately. All right, I'm ready to start doing this shit again. Golems. I kind of want the

1621
05:19:46,200 --> 05:19:55,700
dragons, but I wonder if I just replace the dragons with golems. I got three of them now.

1622
05:19:55,700 --> 05:20:04,970
That's a lot of health. And then go up and take the town. Bring the archers with me probably too.

1623
05:20:04,970 --> 05:20:28,180
So I need archers. Who doesn't need to come on this trip? Leave the trance. Get the golems over

1624
05:20:28,180 --> 05:20:38,459
Pegasus. I think that I'll be able to get this town up there. Health 30. Health 35. Damage 345.

1625
05:20:39,099 --> 05:20:54,169
They're both really good. The unicorns are insane too. They only have so many slots. All right,

1626
05:20:54,169 --> 05:21:08,040
I'll keep this here for now. I'm going to go take that town back. Purple is going to turn around

1627
05:21:08,040 --> 05:21:24,040
and that's fine. Whatever. Get back up here. Now the question is, upgrade the tit- to get to titans.

1628
05:21:24,840 --> 05:21:44,150
Yes, I can now have titans. I have lots to recruit. This is Swiss Silverwing. Silverwing is down

1629
05:21:44,150 --> 05:21:56,680
there. Okay, so I'm going to recruit a bunch of stuff. I can only do that many. You just go back

1630
05:21:56,680 --> 05:22:06,299
in here because like there's no reason for you to be out here anymore. Go up there. There's a titan.

1631
05:22:06,939 --> 05:22:13,560
You can just take the iron golems. You're going to be just hanging out here anyways.

1632
05:22:15,369 --> 05:22:19,209
Titan has ranged attacks. Yeah, and I'm going to upgrade the other ones that I have too.

1633
05:22:19,849 --> 05:22:45,959
I cannot. I'm out of mine. Just hang out there for now. Okay, everybody relax. Let's go. Okay,

1634
05:22:45,959 --> 05:23:12,090
you are down here now. Where are you going? Uh oh. This city sucks. The city is going to fall. It

1635
05:23:12,090 --> 05:23:19,740
just has like 200 little trolls. Maybe he's not going to come that far. It's going to take him a

1636
05:23:19,740 --> 05:23:27,299
couple turns. He's not going to take this one. That's for sure. All right, give me back my

1637
05:23:27,299 --> 05:23:49,740
fucking town, please. How much can I make more recruits? No, stop, stop. Two titans. Yeah,

1638
05:23:50,299 --> 05:24:06,389
you're not going to take this. He ain't going to make it. Here comes Brown, finally.

1639
05:24:09,020 --> 05:24:16,330
Brown's making his way over here now. Give me this. What do you got? You don't got anything here.

1640
05:24:16,330 --> 05:24:28,340
Let's go. Give me it back. All right, dragon. Go in here and instantly kill them. Thank you.

1641
05:24:40,139 --> 05:24:51,509
Stone skin. 111 dead. Done in a second. Just cast a lightning bolt.

1642
05:24:53,419 --> 05:25:07,959
Just wait. Give me my castle back. Expert offense or advanced learning. Expert offense, I think.

1643
05:25:09,560 --> 05:25:28,180
30%. My home. I got it back. Okay, this is where we're going to leave. First, let's walk in there.

1644
05:25:28,180 --> 05:25:38,229
That'd be nice. Archers are going up. Centaurs are going up. When's the new week? It's coming up.

1645
05:25:38,869 --> 05:25:53,529
Dragons are staying. Staying, staying, staying, staying. The reason why I'm doing this is because

1646
05:25:53,529 --> 05:26:08,709
I want to just feed a ton of these units into here. What's the building? What's the town hall?

1647
05:26:08,709 --> 05:26:17,380
Treasury. 10% interest in gold through green dragons. Everything else is enchanted. Let's

1648
05:26:17,380 --> 05:26:27,290
do this just to get it. New week is coming up. We get taxes coming in. End of the stream. What

1649
05:26:27,290 --> 05:26:44,360
are you talking about? All right, so they're in there. You're here. We got enough. We got more

1650
05:26:44,360 --> 05:26:59,459
stuff to recruit. Just keep dumping. 68. More money. I keep forgetting to do that first.

1651
05:27:00,419 --> 05:27:05,979
Let him in. Let him in. Please let me in there at the front door.

1652
05:27:06,540 --> 05:27:14,439
He's coming over here. I only have like three RC cars. Please, they're gonna kill me.

1653
05:27:15,080 --> 05:27:23,240
It'll be fine. There's nobody even on here. It's this guy. He's not gonna make it. That's

1654
05:27:23,240 --> 05:27:39,909
more than a full turn. He ain't gonna make it. We got a new week. Let's go. Somebody got killed.

1655
05:27:40,860 --> 05:27:53,590
Brown just killed somebody. Okay, here he comes. All right. 12,000. Let's upgrade these giants.

1656
05:27:57,319 --> 05:28:14,060
God, that's so expensive. I have five of them. I need more money. Camp him in the city.

1657
05:28:14,779 --> 05:28:40,040
All right. What about the... okay. Wizards. Uh, other wizards. 68, 48, 18, 27, 19, 18,

1658
05:28:40,040 --> 05:28:44,599
40. Okay, this is pretty good. I can't buy anything else. I don't have any money.

1659
05:28:45,479 --> 05:28:54,819
All I can do now is hope and pray because now I can go. But let's see. What we got down here?

1660
05:28:54,819 --> 05:29:01,459
We've got a bunch of... we got so many units to buy. There's so many that it's... I'm getting

1661
05:29:01,459 --> 05:29:08,020
overwhelmed by the amount of units that I can purchase. I need another day to go by.

1662
05:29:08,020 --> 05:29:30,939
I have a lot of sulfur though. Can I get a good exchange on sulfur? Not really. That's a pretty

1663
05:29:30,939 --> 05:29:44,099
bad exchange. Although I can... I mean, I could... I think it's time to take you. I gotta make the

1664
05:29:44,180 --> 05:29:57,220
journey back. I can get two more dragons. I think five dragons. Here's the plan. Five dragons?

1665
05:29:58,860 --> 05:30:03,580
Yeah, he's just like running back and forth like on a route. Yeah, I'm gonna get you two more

1666
05:30:03,580 --> 05:30:13,110
dragons. Because it's a new week, I'm gonna get five gold dragons and now I'm just gonna get some

1667
05:30:13,110 --> 05:30:18,659
money. I'm protected at least enough where no one's gonna kill me. I'm protected completely.

1668
05:30:18,659 --> 05:30:27,959
Here he comes. Stupid fucking taxes. There he is. Here he comes. He's coming in. I gotta be ready.

1669
05:30:27,959 --> 05:30:36,549
He's coming in. This is my... guys, this is the main city. So if this falls, it's gonna be really

1670
05:30:36,549 --> 05:30:52,069
sad. What do I need for this? I need the library. I don't have a fucking library. Why did I not

1671
05:30:52,069 --> 05:31:19,400
build a library? Seven titans. Seven goddamn titans. Am I gonna lose with seven titans?

1672
05:31:20,119 --> 05:31:32,330
He didn't have like... I have seven fucking titans. I feel like I've just been playing against purple

1673
05:31:32,330 --> 05:31:38,659
this whole game while the other two just build up their resources forever. Just give me my damn

1674
05:31:38,659 --> 05:31:55,560
dragon. Here we go. If we lose, we lose. Whatever. Here he comes. Okay, this is it. I got like mines

1675
05:31:55,560 --> 05:32:04,810
and shit. Let's go. What do we got? Wizard. Buff the titan. We're good for spells. Force field.

1676
05:32:04,810 --> 05:32:11,689
Animate the dead. Destroy undead. Lightning bolt. How much do I have any points? 80 points versus

1677
05:32:11,689 --> 05:32:29,369
50. That's so many, but I can do it. I'm thinking put a curse on their archer or a curse on their

1678
05:32:31,060 --> 05:32:46,380
pegasus. The pegasus is gonna fly right over. My pegasus has to die. Okay, curse on the archer.

1679
05:32:47,020 --> 05:33:01,049
And then I'm gonna buff... I'm gonna buff the titan. All in on titan. Here we go. Yes! Okay,

1680
05:33:01,049 --> 05:33:08,119
that's... for being that far away, that's very, very good. That is exceptionally good. I ain't

1681
05:33:08,119 --> 05:33:24,979
moving anybody. Step on the mine. Idiot. How many archers are here? I can't tell. This is gonna be

1682
05:33:24,979 --> 05:33:41,180
all in on titan. No, don't move. Let them hurt themselves. That hurts so much. That hurts so

1683
05:33:41,180 --> 05:33:52,759
much. That sucked. Do I stand at the front door? I think I have to stand at the front door. They're

1684
05:33:52,840 --> 05:33:59,540
gonna kill them. They can't get in yet, but I'm gonna get at the front door. I'm going right here.

1685
05:34:00,860 --> 05:34:12,279
Okay, now it's the... the magi. I just gotta go for the archers. 29. How many treants? 70 fucking

1686
05:34:12,279 --> 05:34:27,139
three treants. 73! I'm never gonna kill 73 of these. Who's up? Genie. Titan. All in.

1687
05:34:28,020 --> 05:34:50,009
Cross the map. No. Holy shit, that was fucking insane. I just killed a hundred. I killed almost

1688
05:34:50,009 --> 05:34:58,819
one fucking hundred of them. All right, all in on titan. That's all that matters. I wonder,

1689
05:34:58,819 --> 05:35:07,819
do I fly you out here just to be a pain in the ass? Or not yet. I think I'm gonna curse the...

1690
05:35:09,020 --> 05:35:18,729
I'm gonna curse the pegasus because this next turn she's flying over. She's gonna fly over

1691
05:35:18,729 --> 05:35:43,189
this next turn. Fly the gargoyle over the archers? Yeah. Let's go on. Force field. I don't know. I'm

1692
05:35:43,189 --> 05:35:50,630
scared. What does the force field do? I've never used it. I'm gonna play... I'm gonna do Stuart

1693
05:35:50,630 --> 05:36:06,119
Smart. Here we go. These two are now worthless. Now I'm going in. This is it. These are my two

1694
05:36:06,119 --> 05:36:17,509
strongest units. It's fine. Pegasus is gonna be dead. Almost left. Nine pegasus die. Yep,

1695
05:36:17,509 --> 05:36:21,509
that was a good distraction. I'm okay with this. He's not coming in now.

1696
05:36:23,159 --> 05:36:44,919
Oh shit, he's in. Not the genie! This is bad. Destroy Undead. I'll give it a try.

1697
05:36:45,560 --> 05:37:11,580
How many are left? I can't tell. Is it five? I can only shoot. Like, the... No, no, what are you doing?

1698
05:37:15,180 --> 05:37:23,700
I thought it was gonna... What? I thought it was a range. It's all in on the goddamn titan. It's

1699
05:37:23,700 --> 05:37:50,619
still possible. Destroy Undead. It fucking barely did shit. All in on titan. How many are fucking

1700
05:37:50,619 --> 05:38:06,950
left? What? Oh my god, there's too many of them. There's so many of them. Are you trying to tell

1701
05:38:06,950 --> 05:38:14,650
me that seven fucking upgraded titans cannot kill a fucking pegasus? Are you... Eat my fucking...

1702
05:38:15,770 --> 05:38:35,909
Ah! I'm actually upset right now. There's only 15 of you. Get over here. Don't step on a landmine.

1703
05:38:36,470 --> 05:38:48,119
Come on, titan. I know you can do this. I'm fucking certain you can do it. You can do it. You

1704
05:38:48,119 --> 05:38:50,599
can do it. Stay alive. Stay alive. You can do it. You can do it. You can do it.

1705
05:38:51,740 --> 05:39:13,419
Bleh! No! This is just too fucking goddamn. I lost everything. The army was just so enormous.

1706
05:39:13,979 --> 05:39:25,110
Whatever. We have a new home now. God damn it. I mean, I've got like five fucking thousand enemies.

1707
05:39:25,990 --> 05:39:46,360
Fuck! Who do I have down here? Who's even up here? I gotta go... Okay, I've gotta bring you up here.

1708
05:39:46,360 --> 05:39:58,779
Grab this shit. Let me go in here. I need... I'm going to get... I can get five... It doesn't

1709
05:39:58,779 --> 05:40:17,880
matter how many dragons I have. Gold dragons. Five gold dragons. Could I go up there and kill

1710
05:40:17,880 --> 05:40:29,590
them now that it's softened? I don't know. I mean, it's... Look, it's gonna take me fucking like

1711
05:40:30,310 --> 05:40:35,529
a week to get back over there. There's nothing in there. He just... He's just running around.

1712
05:40:36,889 --> 05:40:43,610
This dude just put a thousand people on one guy and has just been walking around in circles.

1713
05:40:43,610 --> 05:40:47,619
That's what I should have done from the very beginning. I shouldn't even have bought any more

1714
05:40:47,619 --> 05:40:57,610
houses. Yeah, he has access to make titans now. Why would I even take like Elsa's castle for any

1715
05:40:57,610 --> 05:41:07,130
reason? Just put five thousand people on one guy. What was I thinking? He's going to come take this

1716
05:41:07,130 --> 05:41:23,799
now. I can't even upgrade this. I don't have any money. What was I thinking? Well, I can teleport

1717
05:41:24,279 --> 05:41:27,720
if I teleport. I can only teleport here. We've tested that like three times.

1718
05:41:32,860 --> 05:41:43,450
I mean, I could just try to go and retake it. What's up there? All right, I'm taking the

1719
05:41:43,450 --> 05:41:50,500
captains. I'm taking the archers. We're going to get some more. I'm going to get... Pegasus,

1720
05:41:50,500 --> 05:42:00,180
let's just put everybody on here. I'm going to go through and recruit. So when I... On the way back

1721
05:42:00,180 --> 05:42:07,139
up, I'll fill this up. I probably should leave... What are these? Health 20. No, these are better.

1722
05:42:07,700 --> 05:42:26,020
I just need money. I just need money. Like, very, very badly. Like, so bad. All right,

1723
05:42:26,020 --> 05:42:37,099
well, here comes another one. All right, 8,000 golds all I have.

1724
05:42:43,159 --> 05:43:01,930
That's just not enough. There are like 100... I guess I could get like 70 archers and like

1725
05:43:01,930 --> 05:43:16,360
180, 200-something centaurs. Who sent out you a page to Melee? I didn't mean to,

1726
05:43:17,319 --> 05:43:25,529
because that would mean I have... Let's see. This is just a lost cause here at this point,

1727
05:43:25,529 --> 05:43:34,279
that one. Go through the red portal and just use the town portal. Yeah, but if I go through

1728
05:43:34,279 --> 05:43:42,540
the red portal, I just end up right here. Oh, do I end up here? Which one do I go through?

1729
05:43:43,340 --> 05:43:52,569
And then use the town portal to get to like here, but then I still have to go all the way across

1730
05:43:52,569 --> 05:43:59,639
here if I want to take it. I want to stop here and grab that furry because, I mean, I don't have

1731
05:43:59,639 --> 05:44:10,840
enough enemies. I definitely don't have enough to take that on, because I can't take any of

1732
05:44:10,840 --> 05:44:16,700
this shit. So I'm just going to go with this. I'm going to go recruit and see if I can get

1733
05:44:16,700 --> 05:44:31,020
anything done. Because there's a ton up here. No, no, just give me the... give me archers.

1734
05:44:32,060 --> 05:44:42,259
Give me these, because that's a lot of archers to have. How many pegasus do I have on this guy?

1735
05:44:43,590 --> 05:44:46,790
Pegasus and unicorns. All right, yeah, just... I'm making a pit stop

1736
05:44:47,590 --> 05:45:03,349
right up here. And then I'm gonna walk up here. Go through the portal? Well, if I go through the

1737
05:45:03,349 --> 05:45:20,099
portal, I'm gonna have to teleport back to here anyways. I'm going up here. This will put me at

1738
05:45:20,099 --> 05:45:37,700
at least 100 plus. What do I have for points right now? Again, I'm maxed out. That's good.

1739
05:45:39,830 --> 05:46:02,279
Back up again to recruit more. Just keep time going. No, no, go in the building.

1740
05:46:02,840 --> 05:46:14,169
Oh, for the love of god. All right, this is this is where we do it. So I'm gonna report right change

1741
05:46:14,169 --> 05:46:36,470
out. Maybe the mages? No, I need that. They're ranged too. 29. I don't have that. I can't upgrade

1742
05:46:36,470 --> 05:46:54,380
those. Can I upgrade these? I can make this a capital. And all right, so that's 141. 29 pegasus.

1743
05:46:55,340 --> 05:47:08,659
16 queens. Five gold dragons. Who do we leave behind here? Or do we just

1744
05:47:10,040 --> 05:47:24,540
stack the ranged instead of the golems? Because there's a lot. There's a decent amount here.

1745
05:47:25,259 --> 05:47:53,299
Maybe the genies. 18 to 22. 110 versus like just not enough of them. Yeah, they're too high value.

1746
05:47:53,299 --> 05:47:56,099
I think I could probably get away with this and then make another person here.

1747
05:47:56,659 --> 05:48:12,709
I'm gonna try with this. I think this is good. Maybe I'll, yeah. I do need more range. I need

1748
05:48:12,709 --> 05:48:27,290
more like just picking people off. That means one, two. Yeah, 141 centaurs. All right. This is,

1749
05:48:27,290 --> 05:48:35,700
this is like the last hurrah here. If I can't make this done, I think this is gonna be good.

1750
05:48:37,529 --> 05:48:48,759
Like, this is it. I'm going for it. Give me a damn boat. I'm going back. I'm not. I mean,

1751
05:48:48,759 --> 05:49:03,159
this is free, but I don't want it. Look at all this. Get in the boat. I'm going up here.

1752
05:49:03,799 --> 05:49:16,259
I'm not close enough to summon one yet. I'm going back to take my home back.

1753
05:49:17,939 --> 05:49:22,889
There you are. Are you gonna meet me out on the open field? Is this what this is?

1754
05:49:23,689 --> 05:49:30,840
Lots hoard. Several. He, look, he kind of replaced all his shit. Did he leave anything in here?

1755
05:49:31,560 --> 05:49:34,759
He kind of didn't. He, I think he may have spread himself out a little too much.

1756
05:49:34,759 --> 05:49:43,860
No, that's Luna. What happened to Ares? He stole my shit. And here he comes for this one. I'm

1757
05:49:43,860 --> 05:50:05,740
fucked. I am so fucked. Teleport home. I'll end up over here. This'll be, this is the closest one.

1758
05:50:12,650 --> 05:50:21,880
He's just in here. See what happened was early. I just was learning how to play the game again

1759
05:50:21,880 --> 05:50:27,259
and I like bled myself out so hard. This is going to be really hard to come back. I think

1760
05:50:27,259 --> 05:50:34,810
I'm going to go for it though. We'll try. Uh, summon boat. I'm going to go for it.

1761
05:50:34,810 --> 05:50:51,319
Whatever. It's like a thousand gold. Just give me a damn boat.

1762
05:51:08,220 --> 05:51:18,759
Here they come. Coming to take my castle. They're just going to take it. There's nothing I can do

1763
05:51:18,759 --> 05:51:31,639
about it. I'm so far behind at this point that if this, I, I'm going to be screwed. What can I do?

1764
05:51:31,639 --> 05:51:38,090
Um, magic arrow. Let's try to kill some centaurs. That's really all I can do.

1765
05:51:39,049 --> 05:52:05,669
Where did they get in? Oh, this is already broken. Fuck. Fight to the very end. Um, yeah, that was,

1766
05:52:05,669 --> 05:52:13,779
that person just killed a hundred, almost two hundred. Yeah, this is unbeatable.

1767
05:52:14,500 --> 05:52:41,900
Can I shoot it up like myself? Just take it. Take it. Run around in a circle with you. A

1768
05:52:41,900 --> 05:52:55,689
five million. Why would you do that? That was BM. I just got fucking BM. That just got roped in

1769
05:52:55,689 --> 05:53:08,860
Hearthstone. Oh, thanks. I had a shot there like an hour ago. Oh, it's like six hours. I fucking had

1770
05:53:08,860 --> 05:53:26,459
it too. And they're both up here. I'm screwed. You're using my own men against me. I meet you

1771
05:53:26,459 --> 05:53:54,810
on the open field. I could probably take you. Is there nobody? I can do it. I could probably take

1772
05:53:55,450 --> 05:54:42,520
God damn it. I have to do another goddamn fucking turn. I need to take out the other person down

1773
05:54:42,520 --> 05:54:48,740
here and let go this way. This only, the only way this works is if like somebody else is doing shit

1774
05:54:48,740 --> 05:54:59,500
down here and I like, I have to wrap around. I have to. This is, this is not, that's not a bad

1775
05:54:59,500 --> 05:55:15,750
crew here. Although I probably would rather have, now this is all right because there's a bunch of

1776
05:55:15,750 --> 05:55:27,159
territory over here. I'm going to go this way. No one's coming down here. Give me this shit back.

1777
05:55:27,159 --> 05:55:58,409
It's mine. Come and get me. And over here. Let's go Seer's Hut. Halflings and Trolls. I don't have

1778
05:55:58,409 --> 05:56:15,860
that. I'm sorry. Take the Mercury. You take back our city please. You can get it. Really just stacked

1779
05:56:15,860 --> 05:56:23,700
it up. You knew I was coming. Pack lots, few, few, several, several lots. I can do it and I'm taking

1780
05:56:23,700 --> 05:56:36,759
my fucking home back in and I'm gonna fucking upgrade everybody. I have a lot. This is a really

1781
05:56:36,759 --> 05:56:55,529
like decent, I got Dragons. It's coming back down. All right. Lots of those mages. Several few. He's

1782
05:56:55,529 --> 05:57:23,479
got Titans. Give me back my fucking house. It's mine. Give it to me. Let's do it. Implode. Implode

1783
05:57:23,479 --> 05:57:39,560
on that Titan. Fly. Should I fly the fucking dragon in? These are my Titans. Dragons should just

1784
05:57:40,200 --> 05:57:51,819
completely just obliterate the uh probably the Titan. Who are these mages? How many mages do

1785
05:57:51,819 --> 05:58:15,139
they have? 32 of these mages back here. Obliterate mages? Yeah not yet. Not yet. I can't buff the

1786
05:58:15,139 --> 05:58:52,919
dragon. Why not? Oh Immune Dispel is right. Okay. Kill the genies. Titan's dead. Titan's down. Genie

1787
05:58:52,919 --> 05:59:16,919
next. Genies. Almost dead. I'm going in. I'm flying in. Taking out the elders. Both genies. Elders.

1788
05:59:17,479 --> 05:59:41,500
Get in there. Elders dead. I get to go twice. Genie dead. Dragon. Obliterate. Genie. Buff. Pegasus.

1789
05:59:42,139 --> 06:00:12,090
Pegasus. Attack. Take. I got my house back. I've got my home back. My home is returned to me. I

1790
06:00:12,090 --> 06:00:30,700
get it back and then I'm going to stack and I'm going hunting. Come on out here. I only lost a few

1791
06:00:30,700 --> 06:00:50,360
people. Archers. Some Pegasi. Give me my goddamn house back. All right. Back in business. Artifact

1792
06:00:50,360 --> 06:01:09,080
merchant. Too bad. I have no growth here. This thing. He already used it. Now the question is

1793
06:01:09,720 --> 06:01:21,139
let's keep looking over here. I got that already. This way. Now I start. This is where the stack

1794
06:01:21,139 --> 06:01:33,799
begins. I'm gonna stack genies and mages by the way. I got elders now. Just get in here and hang

1795
06:01:33,799 --> 06:01:52,740
up. This is where this is redemption here. Uh hold on. I want to pick that up. Give me this.

1796
06:01:53,540 --> 06:02:11,000
All right. Here we go. He's coming back. He's coming back. He's saying to himself, oh how dare

1797
06:02:11,000 --> 06:02:22,549
you horde horde lots pack horde pack. He's coming back. Open field. Can I take him in an open field?

1798
06:02:22,549 --> 06:02:44,389
What do you think? Back. Back. Back. Into the castle. Into the castle. I'm just tracking horde

1799
06:02:44,389 --> 06:03:06,900
dead. On an open field dead. Oh fuck. Uh I'm I don't know what to do. I'm freaking out. All right.

1800
06:03:07,700 --> 06:03:17,159
Morale increase. Witch hut. You just slowly acquire stuff. Stables. Hut of the Magi.

1801
06:03:18,119 --> 06:03:23,500
He tells you places near and far. We're gonna get some more reveal on the maps. We already did it.

1802
06:03:24,380 --> 06:03:35,369
Bring in the breastplate stretcher. So I don't know what that is. The breastplate stretcher. I

1803
06:03:35,369 --> 06:03:47,700
I'm fucking getting tired. I'm ready. I'm I'm kind of scared because okay I'm gonna tell you

1804
06:03:47,700 --> 06:03:56,569
something. If I lose here. If Cinderella's castle goes down. I'm fucked. I'm not gonna be able to

1805
06:03:56,569 --> 06:04:04,939
win this game. This is it. He's coming for me. This is the battle. I can't recruit anybody.

1806
06:04:04,939 --> 06:04:20,569
There's nothing else to do. I can do mage guild level five. No. Let him come. Let him come. Let

1807
06:04:20,569 --> 06:04:37,209
him come. Level five. Air elemental. Water elemental. Berserk. The targeted unit will randomly attack

1808
06:04:37,209 --> 06:04:53,189
the nearest unit be it friend or foe. Oh that's fucking pretty great. He would put your life

1809
06:04:53,189 --> 06:05:05,720
savings on Ares. Mistake. He's coming in. We'll see. He's pissed. Bring it on. No he gave up.

1810
06:05:06,279 --> 06:05:20,580
I'm going after him. I'm just I'm just fucking gonna go after him. No I'm not. I'm taking my

1811
06:05:20,580 --> 06:05:43,979
castle back. Stupid. You want to meet in the fucking open field? I'll do it. What do you think? I'll

1812
06:05:43,979 --> 06:06:23,799
wait right here for you. Oh shit. Oops. What is this? Refugee camp? Where's he going? He

1813
06:06:23,799 --> 06:06:31,659
went by me. I'm fucking gonna kill him. Imp growth. Familiar growth. All dwellings increase.

1814
06:06:32,459 --> 06:06:50,259
They're on an open field. Let's go. Dragon. This is why I want to do it in an open field. Obliterate

1815
06:06:50,340 --> 06:06:55,959
immediately. Who's the biggest threat? Five dragons. No no no. Implode. Implode. Fucking

1816
06:06:55,959 --> 06:07:08,119
instantly kill. Destroy. Implode. Implode on the naga queens. Berserk on the naga queen.

1817
06:07:11,849 --> 06:07:28,619
Berserk on the naga queen. You're all dead. Dragon. Obliterate elders. Straight ahead. Pegasus.

1818
06:07:30,279 --> 06:07:43,049
Um I'm gonna go up here. Just to stay away from the uh the naga queen. What the heck way? I can do

1819
06:07:43,049 --> 06:07:56,520
this though. Why can I buff? I couldn't buff him before. I'm gonna buff the archers. Down my way.

1820
06:07:57,159 --> 06:08:05,189
This is the revenge arc. I'm fucking pissed. First it's purple and then it's blue.

1821
06:08:05,990 --> 06:08:25,830
What do I do here? Naga queen. Beautiful. Bye. I win. Didn't lose anybody. Everyone's alive.

1822
06:08:27,029 --> 06:08:31,590
See you later. What was that Ares? Do you want to come up here? Do you have something you want to

1823
06:08:31,590 --> 06:08:53,509
say? You good? What was this? Star Axis. Plus one spell power. Take this back. Not yet. I'm good. I'm

1824
06:08:53,509 --> 06:09:00,630
going for my fucking town again. I'm gonna claim all the resources. I was so. I was pissed. I was

1825
06:09:00,630 --> 06:09:04,810
pissed. That's how you knew it was time to go. You know what I'm saying? That's how you just. I was.

1826
06:09:04,810 --> 06:09:17,580
It's time to go. I'm sorry. Did I. I'm sorry Romeo. Did I kill Juliet? Come back. I'm waiting for you

1827
06:09:17,580 --> 06:09:34,950
right here. He's. Holy shit. He's mad. Tan has been vanquished. Wait. What? Tan's dead. How?

1828
06:09:36,150 --> 06:09:50,569
Who killed Tan? Tan's dead. Plus one defense. Who wiped off Tan during this whole thing? Orange?

1829
06:09:51,610 --> 06:09:57,180
So it's orange, blue, purple's about to be done. This is purple's last stronghold. Ares is running

1830
06:09:57,180 --> 06:10:05,319
away. I'm gonna have control. Wait. Where are you going? You sailing over here. You motherfucker.

1831
06:10:05,319 --> 06:10:17,479
That's fine. I got my guy down here. I gotta. I gotta claim all this shit back. Give me my sulfur

1832
06:10:17,479 --> 06:10:27,400
factory. Give me. All right. Get back. Get back. Get back. Get back. He's coming. He's coming. He's

1833
06:10:27,400 --> 06:10:34,380
coming. He's coming. Blue has the dragons. It don't matter. I'll have ten. I will. I will

1834
06:10:34,380 --> 06:10:46,599
destroy him. Which way is he going? I think he's. Let's just see where he goes. And then I'm. I'm

1835
06:10:46,599 --> 06:10:52,419
gonna have another. I can recruit. I will. Hold on. Hold on a second. Let me just see where this guy's

1836
06:10:52,419 --> 06:11:01,529
going. He's coming over here. Okay. You're going for it, aren't you? He's going for it. He's going

1837
06:11:01,529 --> 06:11:08,009
for it. He's going for it. He really wants it. Can I teleport from here to there? Check this shit out.

1838
06:11:08,009 --> 06:11:16,169
You are fucking dead. I cannot wait to do this. Am I close enough to this one? This was. This is. This

1839
06:11:16,169 --> 06:11:42,729
is uh. Marishen. Uh. There's nobody in here. Except for me. Hi. I'll take some more of these,

1840
06:11:42,729 --> 06:11:59,220
please. Did you. Were you coming over here? Were you. You like on your way over here?

1841
06:12:00,020 --> 06:12:16,900
That's fine, man. In an open field. Thank god I found that fucking artifact. Time to die.

1842
06:12:21,909 --> 06:12:32,310
Oh my god. He has 19 bone dragons. Oh my god. That's a lot. He has 20 bone dragons.

1843
06:12:33,450 --> 06:12:42,520
All right. I'm gonna frenzy bloodlust on that. Will it work? Was. Will Berserk work on you?

1844
06:12:44,250 --> 06:13:17,259
Are you immune to spells? Berserk. Oh. We gotta go in hard. I got five to the liches here.

1845
06:13:22,310 --> 06:13:39,270
Go in. I gotta go in hard immediately. Who the Pegasus going for? This is very important.

1846
06:13:39,830 --> 06:14:06,729
Vampires? Oh. Genie? You know what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna move these guys up a little bit.

1847
06:14:07,450 --> 06:14:19,979
Oh no. That's just a super buff. Holy fuck. I blamed the fucking spell in the beginning.

1848
06:14:20,950 --> 06:14:25,349
Oh my god. No. It was a spell in the beginning. It was a spell in the beginning. It ruined

1849
06:14:25,349 --> 06:14:36,200
everything. He is destroying me. The spell in the beginning ruined everything. I could have given it

1850
06:14:36,200 --> 06:14:45,419
to the anybody else. How did you get 20 of these? How did you get 20 bone dragons? You have

1851
06:14:45,419 --> 06:14:55,340
no castles. He doesn't even have a castle. How do you get 20 of these? It's like 500,000 gold.

1852
06:14:56,380 --> 06:15:15,750
He's got no land. He's got no money. How many liches? 30? At this point, I'm just screwed.

1853
06:15:15,750 --> 06:15:31,900
We gotta just go. We gotta try to wipe some out. We gotta try to hurt something. Holy shit, man.

1854
06:15:32,619 --> 06:15:45,720
You gotta be kidding me. 20 fucking goddamn bone dragons. Did you find these? I had like a

1855
06:15:45,720 --> 06:15:53,240
million gold lying around somewhere in a hole somewhere. I buried it. I lose. The only way

1856
06:15:53,240 --> 06:16:00,020
it's as possible is if I can berserk like somebody over here. I berserk, right? On...

1857
06:16:00,819 --> 06:16:09,799
I don't know. Who can I even do this to? The unicorns? The trees? See if that works.

1858
06:16:11,459 --> 06:16:16,020
And then I'm gonna try to buff. I don't fucking know. I don't have anybody left to do this to.

1859
06:16:20,540 --> 06:16:40,250
Archers? I think he's cleansed everybody. One of the fucking dragons. That's a horse. That's dog

1860
06:16:40,250 --> 06:16:49,369
shit. That is impossible. I just saw this guy like a week ago and you didn't have 19 bone dragons.

1861
06:16:50,169 --> 06:17:12,419
I'm dead. 150 health each. Fucking 25 to 50 damage. I really thought I was gonna win this one.

1862
06:17:24,900 --> 06:17:55,380
Fuck. I can't even. That's unfucking believable. I was like so confident to pack a bone dragon.

1863
06:17:58,220 --> 06:18:12,889
Shove those bone dragons up your ass. You fucking dick. I don't even know if this is winnable.

1864
06:18:17,000 --> 06:18:19,639
Maybe I shouldn't even go after him. I'm not sure I can even do this.

1865
06:18:20,279 --> 06:18:41,509
Let me try one thing. Let's see. Hold on. Okay. I'm talking about potentially. What about like an

1866
06:18:41,509 --> 06:18:54,970
elemental? A berserk implosion. This does 577 damage. I could implode the dragon which would

1867
06:18:54,970 --> 06:19:07,610
take like five or six of them away. Maybe like four? Five? Three. All right. It's very clear

1868
06:19:07,610 --> 06:19:16,090
that the dragons have to die. So what? Okay. 150, 2550, 250, 40 to 50. I might just do dragon to

1869
06:19:16,090 --> 06:19:37,080
dragon here. I'm gonna die but maybe I should hold back. No. The dragon's gonna fly over here.

1870
06:19:40,819 --> 06:19:45,939
If I leave him. I mean I'm gonna sacrifice this dragon right now essentially. Five versus 16. They

1871
06:19:45,939 --> 06:19:55,189
have more HP but I mean maybe I'll really kill a couple. Let's just see what happens. 16, 13,

1872
06:19:55,189 --> 06:20:02,599
four. All right. This is not a bad strategy so far. I'm gonna berserk this guy right here probably

1873
06:20:02,599 --> 06:20:17,290
or this one. I'm not going anywhere yet. Berserk the trident probably then. Undead spell. Well the

1874
06:20:17,290 --> 06:20:27,419
last time I did undead spell it only killed one person. Remember I tried it already and it only

1875
06:20:27,419 --> 06:20:36,150
killed like it only took away one person. It affects everybody. We'll see. Let me try it.

1876
06:20:38,340 --> 06:20:43,459
Um I don't think I want to go in with anybody right now but what's the what's the play here?

1877
06:20:43,459 --> 06:21:02,169
I wonder. I'm not sure I go in. They're gonna attack the dragon but I could go after the uh

1878
06:21:02,169 --> 06:21:15,529
the unicorns. 110, 18, 22. Let's see if I. I'm just going in for the vampires.

1879
06:21:16,090 --> 06:21:24,439
It sounds like clan. 57, 48. All right now I've got the genie. The genie should really buff up

1880
06:21:24,439 --> 06:21:53,689
the ranged. That sucks. I need to be. Well let's just do this. Frenzy. Good. I'm just gonna move up.

1881
06:21:54,490 --> 06:22:08,200
Of course you do that. No dude. No. No way. No way. I have to berserk somebody at the very beginning.

1882
06:22:09,080 --> 06:22:12,939
Otherwise this is. I will never win this in a million years.

1883
06:22:20,419 --> 06:22:29,930
Somebody has to get berserked immediately. Let's see what I can do here.

1884
06:22:35,110 --> 06:22:39,590
It could be possible if I berserk somebody right at the start. Let's see. Let me try it now.

1885
06:22:40,709 --> 06:22:43,750
Let me put because this might be a wash. Let's do the undead thing.

1886
06:22:44,709 --> 06:23:02,220
Destroy undead. I don't think it killed anybody. Nobody died. So everybody's saying I had to do

1887
06:23:02,220 --> 06:23:20,279
that. I hope you see what happened. These guys are actually the bad. I wonder if I berserk.

1888
06:23:24,229 --> 06:23:27,909
Let me see who I can even berserk because I'll try that at the beginning. This is too much.

1889
06:23:28,790 --> 06:23:43,610
What level is this hero? Destroyed. All right. God damn it. He's so powerful. It's not fair how

1890
06:23:43,610 --> 06:23:58,680
powerful you are. You shouldn't be this powerful. Okay. Berserk the tree. I can berserk the unicorn

1891
06:23:59,400 --> 06:24:11,689
or I can berserk the treant. Nobody else can be berserked. The trees will last a lot longer but

1892
06:24:11,689 --> 06:24:21,130
the unicorn might do more. Let's try the unicorn. It worked. All right. Now. Now I'm going for the

1893
06:24:21,130 --> 06:24:35,799
dragon. Unicorn's also going to go for the dragon. Or do I just not move? Just nobody move?

1894
06:24:36,599 --> 06:25:01,509
Should I buff him? Nobody move. Everybody just sit here. Did he cleanse it? No. No, this is no way.

1895
06:25:01,509 --> 06:25:09,080
This is impossible. There's only one way this is possible and I need to get like 25 dragons.

1896
06:25:10,200 --> 06:25:36,549
This is unwinnable. I have to just turtle for five weeks. It's not doable. I got it. I was so

1897
06:25:36,549 --> 06:25:41,990
overconfident too. That's the worst part about this. He's going to get this town again.

1898
06:25:45,560 --> 06:25:51,479
All right. I need a dragon. We're going to meet in the middle here. We're going to do a dragon trade.

1899
06:25:54,360 --> 06:26:15,860
What do I have? I have five dragons. Honestly, I need to like maybe I could win from the castle.

1900
06:26:15,860 --> 06:26:26,790
No, because the dragon can just fly over it. How many dragons can I have here now? There's two there.

1901
06:26:28,439 --> 06:26:41,819
I have two that can be recruited. Two on him. So two, four. I'll have like nine dragons.

1902
06:26:42,540 --> 06:26:57,459
Get some more archers. Get more of these. More pegasus. Do I not have the upgraded ones?

1903
06:26:58,020 --> 06:27:06,180
I could get more of these too. Just get them just to get them. Okay. So I have two more dragons.

1904
06:27:06,900 --> 06:27:10,409
If he's going to take this. What do I do with the guys that are here right now?

1905
06:27:12,060 --> 06:27:26,580
You're just going to. I mean, I may as well. I'm so screwed. I'm just going to have to go back

1906
06:27:26,580 --> 06:27:39,750
down here and just get more. Admit defeat? Not yet. Not yet. Not yet. I'm not done yet. I still

1907
06:27:39,750 --> 06:27:45,990
have plenty of property. I just need to get to the right spot. I can trade some units here.

1908
06:27:46,950 --> 06:27:51,349
I have a lot of this guy can just be like a good unit trader. I've conquered all this over here.

1909
06:27:54,630 --> 06:28:05,900
He's going to go take the castle. Whatever. Take it. I don't care. There he goes. He'll get it.

1910
06:28:05,900 --> 06:28:17,880
Whatever. Nineteen bone dragons. I saw you like less than two weeks ago. Motherfucker. I can't

1911
06:28:17,880 --> 06:28:23,979
believe. Well, I could do. This is a good opportunity to just. Maybe I can wipe up some

1912
06:28:23,979 --> 06:28:41,049
unicorns. What level are you? The computer just like gave him all this random shit. He didn't do

1913
06:28:41,049 --> 06:28:59,000
anything for this. He just. They gave him to him. Well, here's the thing. He might leave some of

1914
06:28:59,000 --> 06:29:03,400
these here, which is a good thing. Maybe I can. I might be just. Maybe I'll just be able to turn

1915
06:29:03,400 --> 06:29:12,139
around. You know, you like leave the vampires and the fucking. Okay. Whatever. What do you leave

1916
06:29:12,139 --> 06:29:24,860
there? All right. He left some. He left a bunch of shit here. He left the unicorns. He left his

1917
06:29:24,860 --> 06:29:46,009
trance. No, he still has so many. Not worth it. Stick with the plan. Stick to the plan. Come here.

1918
06:29:47,849 --> 06:30:03,529
Seven dragons. More centaurs. I need to upgrade these pegasuses. Do I not have it? Can I? I

1919
06:30:03,529 --> 06:30:17,259
waste my treasure reef. Silver pegasi. There it is. I want to upgrade these too. I need to upgrade

1920
06:30:17,259 --> 06:30:23,180
the archers. I'm going to just sit down here and fucking turtle. He's blocked off the path of escape.

1921
06:30:23,180 --> 06:30:28,299
Well, this is my final stand. If I'm dead, then I'm dead. And it was really fun. This game's fucking

1922
06:30:28,299 --> 06:30:35,529
awesome. So if this is it, this is it. If he's like, he's like fucking coming down here to kill me,

1923
06:30:38,139 --> 06:30:46,330
then that's it. And I'll have to just say, well, what do you know? Oh well. No, here he comes.

1924
06:30:47,849 --> 06:30:54,009
He's coming down here. He's coming to get us. We have to everybody. I'm parking him in the front.

1925
06:30:55,060 --> 06:30:59,860
Yeah. I'm going to be inside. And then this, uh, Kalad guy is going to be standing at the front door.

1926
06:30:59,860 --> 06:31:29,049
Okay. Nine dragons, 116 archers, 293 centaurs, 58, 16, 38. Like this is, this is so ridiculous.

1927
06:31:29,049 --> 06:31:36,810
Like I have to be able to put up a defense. The genies instead of, I need genies instead of the

1928
06:31:36,810 --> 06:31:45,990
dwarfs. You could recruit heroes across the map and start a new era and conquer the other dudes.

1929
06:31:46,869 --> 06:31:54,939
Yeah. But I have like a personal vendetta right now. Can anything else be upgraded?

1930
06:31:55,580 --> 06:32:04,299
Treasury, 10% interest, fortune, luck of the garrison and the hero by two. Let's do it.

1931
06:32:04,860 --> 06:32:18,889
They're coming in. So let's trade with you. You can take the dwarfs. I will take the pegasus. I

1932
06:32:18,889 --> 06:32:52,040
will take these. Okay. Go back in there. Unicorns. Okay. Now I think he's back to you. Okay. Get back

1933
06:32:52,040 --> 06:33:09,779
in here. Get up here. Hold on. I need to like switch this out. This is such a joke. I can't

1934
06:33:09,779 --> 06:33:20,650
believe I'm doing this. All right. Well, here we go. I've got, this is my army. He's going to be

1935
06:33:20,650 --> 06:33:28,040
outside 119. This is just, he's just here. I also have this still, but it's the only other thing I

1936
06:33:28,040 --> 06:33:46,220
got. Park yourself in here. Almost 10 dragons. So I have so many people. Like I just got to stay

1937
06:33:46,220 --> 06:33:51,110
behind the walls and just try to fight. Can you put both in the castle? I don't think you can.

1938
06:33:52,599 --> 06:34:02,009
I mean, no, he could just stand right outside the door. Okay. Here comes our inevitable defeat.

1939
06:34:08,860 --> 06:34:21,290
Let him in the castle and then run away with the teleport spell. But then I would just go all the

1940
06:34:21,290 --> 06:34:28,220
way back and it repeats again. And then I just have to go like, what's even blue doing? This is

1941
06:34:28,220 --> 06:34:35,750
orange is only place. I don't think this guy's moved. Has orange moved the whole, I don't think

1942
06:34:35,750 --> 06:34:48,709
he can leave. He can't even leave. He's just over here. God damn it. Well, whatever. It was, it was

1943
06:34:48,709 --> 06:35:17,849
fun. Let's see what happens. Red is still a player. Here he comes. Okay. There he goes. Three. I got

1944
06:35:17,849 --> 06:35:34,229
one Titan here. It's possible that I could make it to week seven. Look at all the purple. Purple

1945
06:35:34,229 --> 06:35:44,810
had nothing. Like a week ago. And now all of a sudden you have everything. Did you just do

1946
06:35:44,810 --> 06:36:14,229
something over here? Like tan died and you picked up all the houses for free. I already know what

1947
06:36:14,229 --> 06:36:27,619
that did. It's inevitable. Maybe he'll go this way and I can buy a few more dragons. I want to

1948
06:36:27,619 --> 06:36:36,810
like start over the scenario. Here comes the other guy. Oh, this is, this is the, this is,

1949
06:36:36,810 --> 06:36:42,759
it's over. This is my other stronghold. I'm about to be wiped out. I'm actually about to

1950
06:36:42,759 --> 06:36:56,040
be completely removed from the game. Quick kill the king. Throw a bolt at the king's head.

1951
06:36:56,599 --> 06:37:05,459
I've been restarting my scenario because I suck at this game. Oh man. I mean, it's, it's a pretty,

1952
06:37:07,049 --> 06:37:21,639
it's not, the game's not necessarily easy. That is a lot of fun though. How do they have these units?

1953
06:37:22,279 --> 06:37:29,700
I don't know. He came into a fucking like trust or something. Somehow he, maybe when he, you know

1954
06:37:29,700 --> 06:37:36,169
what might've happened? So you know I said tan was defeated. He may have just stumbled upon tan's

1955
06:37:36,169 --> 06:37:41,049
last building and then took all of tan's money because tan, I figured it out. This is what happened.

1956
06:37:41,849 --> 06:37:49,060
So tan wasn't doing anything all game. It was just stockpiling money and stockpiling resources.

1957
06:37:49,619 --> 06:37:54,180
So he took over tan because tan was just a fucking moron. It was like walking in circles.

1958
06:37:54,979 --> 06:37:59,060
And took all of his money and all of his stuff like Monopoly style and then just built like

1959
06:37:59,060 --> 06:38:08,009
30 dragons. I think that's what happened. I think, like that was fucking absurd.

1960
06:38:12,900 --> 06:38:23,509
Why didn't I do that? I mean this is my first game coming back from, you know, a while. Purple.

1961
06:38:25,110 --> 06:38:35,340
I can feel, yes! Okay. My last stand is now higher. I can get more dragons. 10 dragons.

1962
06:38:36,169 --> 06:38:47,130
That's all I can afford. Wait, I can sell all my resources. Okay, hold on. Okay, I want money.

1963
06:38:47,130 --> 06:38:54,090
I'm willing to give you this. Wow, this is bad. No, I need those. What do I need for dragon?

1964
06:38:55,130 --> 06:39:01,740
Crystals. I need two crystals. I have two crystals. It's time to like, I'm liquidating.

1965
06:39:07,990 --> 06:39:17,000
No, no. Get, here. I'm gonna liquidate my entire, uh, yeah. It's liquidation time. This is it.

1966
06:39:17,720 --> 06:39:25,770
He's knocking on my front door. I'm the last remaining Monopoly player. 40. Sell gold for

1967
06:39:25,770 --> 06:39:36,229
gold. What? Wood. Look at how bad of a trade-off this is. I'm the last remaining fucking Monopoly

1968
06:39:36,229 --> 06:40:09,900
player. I'm gonna at least give a go out with a bang. 11 dragons. 88. I have fucking 323 of

1969
06:40:09,900 --> 06:40:28,939
these. That has to be worth something. No more money. Liquidate everything else. Just liquidate

1970
06:40:28,939 --> 06:40:38,950
everything. I have to. It's over. This is the end. If I win, then I beat the, I beat the hardest

1971
06:40:38,950 --> 06:40:54,139
fucking guy on the map. We'll see. What can I buy? Treants, probably. It's probably better.

1972
06:40:55,669 --> 06:41:11,060
Yep. That's it. I have 100 bucks. I have 101 dollars. Good luck, everybody. This is our final

1973
06:41:11,060 --> 06:41:26,709
stand. Here we go. Blue and red have just been fighting. This is what happens in these games.

1974
06:41:26,709 --> 06:41:45,159
And here it comes. And he walked by us. He's just toying with me. I have zero resources. I have

1975
06:41:45,159 --> 06:42:01,669
nothing. Just come over here and fight me. Engage him. Fight the open battle with this guy. This is

1976
06:42:01,669 --> 06:42:17,459
gonna be embarrassingly awful. If I can kill. You wanna know what the plan here is? You wanna know

1977
06:42:17,459 --> 06:42:27,080
exactly what I'm doing? The plan is, try to at least get rid of one or two bone dragons. That's

1978
06:42:27,080 --> 06:42:53,130
it. I can't even cast these. You guys level one. I like fucked it up from the very beginning.

1979
06:42:54,939 --> 06:42:59,259
It's alright though. Like, it's the first time I've played in a while. You know,

1980
06:42:59,259 --> 06:43:05,340
sometimes you just gotta learn. This is a seven hour learning experience. Good. Come over here.

1981
06:43:06,650 --> 06:43:24,099
Send in the dwarves. All I care about is just hurting this dragon. Kill one. Yes. Okay, he got

1982
06:43:24,099 --> 06:43:33,020
one. Try to get a couple more. Just try. Get this down to like 15. And then I got like 11 dragons.

1983
06:43:34,540 --> 06:43:45,349
Fine, come up here. Ooh, that's pretty good. 17. It's getting... did a good job. I just realized

1984
06:43:45,349 --> 06:44:06,009
that was a hare. Is that hare? That's alright. He lost two dragons. This is a castle, right? Yes.

1985
06:44:06,569 --> 06:44:27,779
Okay. I just was making sure. It's time. Can we hold this off? I ain't coming out. No, no, he sent

1986
06:44:27,779 --> 06:44:40,330
it in his shitty. It's her again. They're like, look at, they're just like, they're just so fun

1987
06:44:40,330 --> 06:45:03,020
together. This is my final castle. Come on. Bring it. Do it. Do it. End me. End my misery.

1988
06:45:03,020 --> 06:45:14,310
I'm getting out. Let's go. I'm killing her. You're fucking dead. And this time I'm killing her. You

1989
06:45:14,310 --> 06:45:16,790
know what I mean? Like, if there's one thing I'm going to do, I'm going to make sure, I'm going to

1990
06:45:16,790 --> 06:45:25,189
make sure that she's dead. Going for the fucking dwarves immediately. Instakill. No. You know what?

1991
06:45:25,189 --> 06:45:32,500
Fucking... what do I want to do here? This is going to be embarrassing. It is going to be awful.

1992
06:45:33,939 --> 06:45:39,369
Just inferno. No, I don't want to spend that many points. I don't even need to do that. The dragon

1993
06:45:39,369 --> 06:46:01,659
will kill them all in one hit. Don't let her run. Let's kill the archers and then buff. Don't not

1994
06:46:01,659 --> 06:46:07,979
retreat. Please let me just have one victory. Let me like kill your wife or your friend.

1995
06:46:11,419 --> 06:46:19,270
Dead. Now we can turn around. I got you. I got your feet. Warn on the feet. This item increases

1996
06:46:19,270 --> 06:46:28,040
your knowledge and power by plus one. Leveled up. More damage sorcery. What are you gonna say

1997
06:46:28,040 --> 06:46:36,979
about that? Huh? What are you gonna do about it? What are you gonna do about it? A whole lot of

1998
06:46:36,979 --> 06:46:58,259
nothing. Is it on? I put it on. I'm out though. Maybe now he's gonna turn around. No, he's not

1999
06:46:58,259 --> 06:47:06,919
turning around yet. He's leaving. No. Why are you leaving? Don't do this to me. Fuck. I'm just,

2000
06:47:06,919 --> 06:47:14,630
am I gonna, you know what? I got a better idea. I'm abandoning my home next week.

2001
06:47:16,150 --> 06:47:38,520
God damn it. What do I do? I just, I thought that was gonna be it. Um, I'm gonna go kill Orange.

2002
06:47:40,659 --> 06:47:47,930
Orange is dead. Watch this shit. You ready? I'm gonna, I'm gonna wipe out Orange right now.

2003
06:47:57,639 --> 06:48:14,040
I think I can do it. And I'm gonna take all of his money. Let's get in there.

2004
06:48:16,919 --> 06:48:30,819
We're going for, if I can't kill Purple, I'm going for Orange. Berserk. Berserk on the manticores.

2005
06:48:31,380 --> 06:48:39,220
I'm gonna win. I'm gonna take this castle. And I'm gonna sit here for fucking a year.

2006
06:48:42,009 --> 06:48:58,840
Just you wait. Just get the dragon in now. Everybody get in. Get in now. Everybody get in.

2007
06:49:02,020 --> 06:49:12,520
Don't give him a second. Buff. Manticore. Oh, what's that? Now you're gonna fight the dragon, huh?

2008
06:49:14,459 --> 06:49:33,779
Dead. Good, they're killing each other. Thank god. Okay. How many dragons do I have left? Get

2009
06:49:33,779 --> 06:49:50,810
them up here. Archers to, who's that? I can't see who's up here. The minotaurs. Or the, who's left?

2010
06:49:51,540 --> 06:50:02,680
Or maybe the, um, Medusas, yeah. I can't get in though. That door's gonna open.

2011
06:50:10,419 --> 06:50:16,810
Give me all his money. What do we think? Maybe I should kill the Medusas or should I go right

2012
06:50:16,810 --> 06:50:37,430
for the minotaur? Minotaur. 12 minotaurs dead. I'm gonna berserk somebody else. Berserk on the,

2013
06:50:38,310 --> 06:50:45,930
I wonder who I should do this to. Probably the manticore again. Or on the minotaurs. They

2014
06:50:45,930 --> 06:50:58,229
haven't attacked yet. Or on the lich? I can't. He's undead. I can't. You can't do it on undead.

2015
06:50:58,950 --> 06:51:04,889
Maybe the Medusas. Or maybe the Harpies and they'll fly over and just kill themselves.

2016
06:51:09,529 --> 06:51:16,540
Or, no, no, no, no, no, no. I'm gonna, I'm gonna implode. I'm just gonna obliterate completely.

2017
06:51:17,419 --> 06:51:27,400
Always implode. Implosion on, um, on the manticore. Just melt them. There we go. Okay, great. Good,

2018
06:51:27,400 --> 06:51:43,860
good, good. Minotaur, attack. Six minotaurs dead. I just burnt my own people. I got this. I'm gonna

2019
06:51:43,860 --> 06:52:19,340
win. Okay, I get to go again. Do it twice. I can't get in there. I can't go anywhere. Get the dragon

2020
06:52:19,340 --> 06:52:44,840
out. He's, I can't. How many dragons? Five? Versus five? No, kill him. I can do it. Okay, I'm gonna

2021
06:52:44,840 --> 06:52:59,509
get him out. Bad move. No, you can go back. Okay, hold on. Kill the minotaurs. Where's resurrect?

2022
06:53:00,569 --> 06:53:28,060
Resurrection. I can't do it to the dragon. I'm gonna implode again. I can't do it to anybody.

2023
06:53:28,700 --> 06:53:46,549
I should have left the fucking dragon in. I should have left the dragon inside. How many

2024
06:53:46,549 --> 06:53:55,340
left? Five? There's only one more minotaur left. Kill it. I can't even get in here.

2025
06:54:00,900 --> 06:54:28,069
I got this. I'm gonna win. All right, it's open. Dragon to manticore. This manticore has to die.

2026
06:54:39,240 --> 06:54:51,669
How many points left? 69 points. Implode. It's all right. The dragon's fine because everything's

2027
06:54:51,669 --> 06:55:16,869
fine. I can't move. I have to kill this manticore right now with my dragon. These walls have to

2028
06:55:16,869 --> 06:55:36,139
collapse. Manticore. Got it. I win. I have to win. I win. Go in with the genie.

2029
06:55:50,619 --> 06:55:57,380
I get the dragon still in here. I can't get in, unfortunately. There's nothing I can do.

2030
06:56:09,990 --> 06:56:22,889
Burn. 29 harpies dead. 22 harpies dead. That's so close, but the others can't do anything.

2031
06:56:22,889 --> 06:56:45,380
Implode. I don't have any more points. I only have four. Magic arrow. I'm gonna take it.

2032
06:56:45,380 --> 06:57:24,439
Hopefully this is all of orange. 15, 1, game over. Ah, fuck. He's too big. I got

2033
06:57:24,439 --> 06:57:41,479
17,000 experience. Oh my god. I got torso of legion and spell scroll. This item when

2034
06:57:41,479 --> 06:57:46,680
equipped by a hero in a town increases the growth of your fourth level units by three per week.

2035
06:57:48,939 --> 06:57:54,459
And this scroll contains the dimension door spell, which is added into your spell book for as long

2036
06:57:54,459 --> 06:58:09,270
as you carry the scroll. More experience. Yeah. Expert sorcery. 15% more damage. Yes.

2037
06:58:11,259 --> 06:58:20,599
Orange has been vanquished. I killed him. He was stuck here. What did I get? Did I get anything?

2038
06:58:20,599 --> 06:58:28,069
I killed orange. He was just sitting here. What do I get for killing orange? I beat him. I won.

2039
06:58:33,430 --> 06:58:59,500
I did it. I killed orange. I don't get anything. Uh, 224 skeletons. I still have this house. Who's

2040
06:58:59,500 --> 06:59:26,409
in here? There's nobody here. Uh, now what? Orange's gone. Tana's gone. Now I'm the new orange.

2041
06:59:29,020 --> 06:59:47,189
Oh, I see. Because I can't leave. That's why he was up here for so long. Because he ran out of places.

2042
06:59:47,750 --> 06:59:52,009
So he didn't have another castle and he was stuck here.

2043
06:59:57,689 --> 07:00:03,770
That's fucking hilarious. So I actually just went up here for no reason because orange didn't give

2044
07:00:03,770 --> 07:00:13,590
me anything for losing. And he was actually just stuck here for eternity. All right. What's the

2045
07:00:13,590 --> 07:00:25,930
spell? Let's see what it is. Visions. Uh, what was it called? The dimension something. I think it

2046
07:00:26,009 --> 07:00:34,840
has to be my inventory. Oh, let's just put it on. So it's on. So what is it called?

2047
07:00:38,139 --> 07:00:45,259
Dimension door. Once per day, you may teleport your hero to a visible unoccupied location on

2048
07:00:45,259 --> 07:01:02,840
the map. Hey, was it worth it? You tell me at this point, because I, um, I absolutely would not have

2049
07:01:02,840 --> 07:01:12,500
gotten the dimension door. Rolled up your fourth level units by three per week. Here's your eagle

2050
07:01:12,500 --> 07:01:18,439
eye skill. I feel like, I don't, I feel like this is much better. What eagle eye skill by 10%.

2051
07:01:19,560 --> 07:01:31,419
I'll put this on. I want more growth or extra spell points per day. This is really good. This

2052
07:01:31,419 --> 07:01:43,459
is really good. That's really good. All right. As the new orange, I'm going to turtle here.

2053
07:01:43,459 --> 07:01:55,380
This training is going to be like fucking very long. What do we have in here? Man of vortex.

2054
07:01:56,020 --> 07:02:12,500
I don't have any resources though, guys. This place sucks. How the fuck did you not upgrade any of

2055
07:02:12,500 --> 07:02:27,380
this? You were sitting here for like three months. You didn't upgrade anything. What an idiot. So

2056
07:02:27,380 --> 07:02:39,000
I'm just going to teleport and take stuff and teleport back. Finally something worthy. I shall

2057
07:02:39,000 --> 07:02:44,970
send word immediately to the border guard that you'll be allowed to pass. Okay. All right. So

2058
07:02:44,970 --> 07:02:49,900
I'm going to take this dickhead and we're going to go resource hunting. That's all you are for

2059
07:02:49,900 --> 07:03:00,360
is just to get resources. Even as a one a day, you can just kind of chill in the tent. No, wait a

2060
07:03:00,360 --> 07:03:17,540
minute. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I can teleport. I'm going to teleport over here. Oh my God. Fuck.

2061
07:03:26,439 --> 07:03:39,750
13, not enough. All right. Just, I'm going to look at all this shit that purple has now.

2062
07:03:39,750 --> 07:03:50,099
This is not, I'll never win. Look at the map. I don't even know what's over here.

2063
07:03:52,069 --> 07:04:05,380
Purple has everything. He's got like a bunch of, look at all the, his heroes now.

2064
07:04:06,659 --> 07:04:09,380
He's got like five heroes. All of them have dragons.

2065
07:04:11,209 --> 07:04:23,139
A lot, lots of bone dragons. It's not a pack anymore. There's probably 30 dragons there now.

2066
07:04:23,860 --> 07:04:37,560
I will, there's no way I can win this. I mean, okay. You remember World of Warcraft 3,

2067
07:04:38,680 --> 07:04:43,080
how you would play that person online, that you would wipe them out and you'd be clearly,

2068
07:04:43,080 --> 07:04:50,150
you're going to win the game. Very clearly. You won. And they build like five farms in random

2069
07:04:50,150 --> 07:05:00,549
places on the map. That's what I'm doing. I still have a gold mine and a town hall that I built just

2070
07:05:00,549 --> 07:05:16,490
to be an asshole, just somewhere. And he's just looking for me. Run out the clock from five months

2071
07:05:17,130 --> 07:05:25,720
we've been doing this. And this is just on, well, okay. What's it on? It's on the normal difficulty

2072
07:05:25,720 --> 07:05:36,860
with like a 30% like increase in difficulty on the actual game, right? There's still imps over

2073
07:05:36,860 --> 07:06:14,200
here. I lose. I'm not going to be able to do this. I can make some more dragons, but I don't,

2074
07:06:15,159 --> 07:06:24,740
I could just make dragons and I don't have enough money. It's over. I lose. I lose. I lose. There's

2075
07:06:24,740 --> 07:06:43,610
nothing I can do. He has so much. I didn't even get to have my last stand. Here he comes. He's

2076
07:06:43,610 --> 07:07:01,990
about to put me in perpetual fucking nightmare mode. Run. Run away. Don't. Oh, he's going to,

2077
07:07:01,990 --> 07:07:05,349
he's trying to stick me in purgatory, but he doesn't know that I can teleport. You don't know

2078
07:07:05,349 --> 07:07:55,419
shit. 260 points. Are you ready for this? Asshole. Get the castle. Mine. And going down. In fact,

2079
07:07:55,419 --> 07:07:59,419
I'm going to teleport tomorrow and take another one. I'm going to teleport over here and then I'm

2080
07:07:59,419 --> 07:08:16,700
going to teleport like over here. Well, I have to be able to see it. Nevermind. I'm going to get

2081
07:08:16,700 --> 07:08:26,340
a ball. What? What? Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Yeah. How did you get that? There was nobody

2082
07:08:26,340 --> 07:08:38,810
there. There wasn't anyone even there. That's so stupid. Oh, God damn it. He's stuck. He's stuck.

2083
07:08:40,090 --> 07:08:48,729
It's there. He's not going to be able to get out. He's not going to be able to leave. I have a

2084
07:08:48,729 --> 07:08:56,779
chance. He's got all of his best units here. I'm going to fucking win the game. Boys and girls,

2085
07:08:56,779 --> 07:09:10,970
let's go. I'm ready. I'm fucking pumped right now. All right. Let's go. Pick up some resources

2086
07:09:10,970 --> 07:09:24,380
along the way. He can't leave. Go get all the land back. He's just going to pack a few, a few

2087
07:09:24,380 --> 07:09:51,939
lots pack. You should tele-frag them. Give me the dragons. Hold on. Let's see what happens.

2088
07:09:52,580 --> 07:10:00,549
Is there a way that I can make them all go in the portal? Blue has finally made it over here.

2089
07:10:16,150 --> 07:10:22,939
Oh shit. Fuck it. Yeah, take over all this stuff. Fight each other. Kill them. You fight down there

2090
07:10:22,939 --> 07:10:28,970
while I take everything up top. I'm going to do this very slowly. No, no, no, no, no, no.

2091
07:10:30,169 --> 07:10:48,919
Take it all. Then I'm going to know what I'm doing. Here he goes. This is awesome. I'm so happy right

2092
07:10:48,919 --> 07:11:06,200
now. What else can I take going this way? I can get the sulfur. Yep. Okay. Keep going.

2093
07:11:06,919 --> 07:11:29,430
Why are you coming down to me? Why are you going down to me? Uh-oh. Teleport. This, I can't

2094
07:11:32,069 --> 07:11:54,709
so stupid. He's got nothing in there. Where is he? He's up there. Oh, it's blue.

2095
07:11:54,709 --> 07:12:03,450
No, I needed these dragons. I was going to come back and get them. Um,

2096
07:12:03,450 --> 07:12:23,509
Vexant Icebolt. He has all, I think, the best units, at least top tier units, all in each slot.

2097
07:12:24,069 --> 07:12:44,790
It's all, they all can fly. Might as well, um, just go out the front door.

2098
07:12:45,830 --> 07:12:49,909
Meet them all in the open field. It's not like I can do about this.

2099
07:12:50,549 --> 07:13:01,540
Maybe I can take out one or two, but it don't matter. He's got some cool monsters, though.

2100
07:13:07,639 --> 07:13:26,340
One dwarf. Why is it one, one, one, one? This seems weird. The thing is, though, when I had my

2101
07:13:26,340 --> 07:13:33,459
original, my like 11 dragons, my 300 centaurs, I probably could have done this. This would have

2102
07:13:33,459 --> 07:13:44,330
been a good fight. I would have won without much of a problem. It was just purple. Purple somehow

2103
07:13:45,209 --> 07:14:27,689
just amassed a fortune, amassed a ton of money. Well, kill the genies. Yes, we're back home.

2104
07:14:28,490 --> 07:14:49,830
Genie versus genie. Good attack of dragon mistake. I have 245 skeletons, though.

2105
07:14:51,029 --> 07:15:10,200
Maybe I'll get lucky and I will get like a thousand skeletons, right? Two thousand experience.

2106
07:15:10,200 --> 07:15:16,819
Got my capital back, what's in here? All right, I can get it. I can get some titans, I think.

2107
07:15:22,150 --> 07:15:32,759
Two titans. I can get some more of these. What else? Genies? No genies.

2108
07:15:33,319 --> 07:15:56,150
I can fill up on these. 45. I could get a bunch of these. No, I've got one titan. What do you got?

2109
07:15:56,150 --> 07:16:06,900
Few pack, several throng, lots of hoard. Guys, guys, I can beat this. I can win. I can win right

2110
07:16:06,900 --> 07:16:25,319
now. I can, I can kill this person right now. Go ahead, fight each other down here. Let's go.

2111
07:16:25,959 --> 07:16:33,479
You got nothing. What do you got? I'm just, I'm going right. We're not wasting a second.

2112
07:16:33,479 --> 07:16:50,060
I'm gonna obliterate. Where is it? I have so many spells. Where is obliterate? Where is it?

2113
07:16:50,060 --> 07:17:15,259
Obliterate. Implosion, not obliterate. You know what I'm saying. Obliterate. Ares is stuck in

2114
07:17:15,259 --> 07:17:20,099
the corner. I might actually be able to do this as long as I can, like, kind of...

2115
07:17:21,060 --> 07:17:32,200
Why am I flocking with the archer? I'm losing it. I'm losing my fucking mind.

2116
07:17:38,020 --> 07:17:45,689
Okay, that's pretty good. Pretty good, pretty good, pretty good. All right, so now let's take it back

2117
07:17:45,689 --> 07:17:55,610
this way. I've got some titans. I've got, I can, I'm gonna teleport this and watch this shit. I'm

2118
07:17:55,610 --> 07:17:59,529
gonna teleport over here and then I'm gonna go down and I'm gonna get blue and I'm gonna get

2119
07:17:59,529 --> 07:18:03,689
fucking red. I'm gonna kill red. Listen to me. What's wrong with me? I'm like fucking freaking out.

2120
07:18:04,569 --> 07:18:38,740
He's turning mad. That's great. Okay, would like to recruit gremlins? No, just, this is all I got.

2121
07:18:48,220 --> 07:18:55,939
Yeah, blue is, I have to scoop up. I gotta go around. I have to scoop up. I'm not gonna leave

2122
07:18:55,939 --> 07:19:13,060
this place undefended. This one is, all right, hold on a minute. I need money. He can't do anything.

2123
07:19:13,060 --> 07:19:27,479
He's fucked. He's screwed. This is perfect. That's so awesome. More crystals. All right,

2124
07:19:27,479 --> 07:19:48,139
let me get the lumberyard. This is so stupid. Uh oh. They're getting in their boats. All right,

2125
07:19:48,139 --> 07:19:53,979
I got all the resources. Now let's get over here and I'm gonna teleport this way.

2126
07:19:54,700 --> 07:20:00,889
Although, how am I doing on, I feel like I should, I'm gonna get some more genies.

2127
07:20:03,189 --> 07:20:19,400
I'm gonna get four titans. More of these. Let's not rush here. Hold on. I can't believe I've done this

2128
07:20:19,400 --> 07:20:31,500
camp. This is like random campaign for fucking seven and a half hours. Should I just farm titans?

2129
07:20:31,500 --> 07:20:50,380
266 skeletons. Three more mages. Yeah, I'm just gonna sit out here, man. I'm gonna be the biggest

2130
07:20:50,380 --> 07:20:55,959
piece of shit ever. I'm gonna be the biggest fucking piece of crap ever. I'm just gonna skip

2131
07:20:55,959 --> 07:21:16,310
every single turn. What is gonna speed click? Purple on land? Uh, he's dead. Archers,

2132
07:21:16,950 --> 07:21:44,310
hoard a pet. You're dead. Get over here. Let's go. I'll kill you all. He's coming up. Okay, he's

2133
07:21:44,310 --> 07:23:01,860
dead. I got better dragons. Berserk on the dragon. Kill the archers. Get the fuck out of here.

2134
07:23:02,740 --> 07:23:10,490
I just burnt the fucking tent down.

2135
07:23:15,369 --> 07:23:23,459
I win. Slowly but surely, I'm going to kill all of purple and I'm gonna win.

2136
07:23:24,360 --> 07:23:49,770
It's a war of attrition at this point. I'm gonna win. I'm gonna get a balcony pick with a handsome

2137
07:23:49,770 --> 07:24:29,740
guy. Remember, are you seriously bringing another guy over here? Several packs, several fused,

2138
07:24:29,740 --> 07:24:44,229
several. They keep respawning and coming back to me. This is fucking awesome. I need more money

2139
07:24:44,229 --> 07:24:52,790
though. My resources aren't terrible. All right, here's what I'm gonna do. Okay, I'm gonna go.

2140
07:24:52,790 --> 07:24:58,259
That came out of nowhere. I'm gonna come over. I'm gonna teleport over here. I'm going this way

2141
07:24:58,979 --> 07:25:17,340
and I'm gonna go swoop by red. I still have a ton of units. I'm one more week and then I'm

2142
07:25:17,340 --> 07:25:32,139
gonna teleport over there. Somebody's coming over here though. Oh, they have to fucking do

2143
07:25:32,139 --> 07:25:41,299
that right now. It's this guy. I can't, I don't know if I can leave yet because if I teleport here,

2144
07:25:41,299 --> 07:25:57,400
I can swoop around. I don't even have this viewed. Stupid tax bullshit. No, I gotta wait another day.

2145
07:26:04,840 --> 07:26:16,869
Here you come. Here you come. Okay, I gotta be ready for this. What do you think? Two titans and

2146
07:26:16,869 --> 07:26:40,919
then replace the skeletons. I need, I don't have any money. I need two crystal, I need, okay, I need

2147
07:26:40,919 --> 07:26:48,279
two like nerds. 5,000. 5,000 gold. I have, I need, all right, okay, here we go. I'm gonna sell some

2148
07:26:48,279 --> 07:27:00,810
shit. Where's the market here? Down here? What the fuck is it? Artifact merchant? What the hell is this?

2149
07:27:01,689 --> 07:27:14,729
Defense, growth, cot, mercury. No. Where's the merchant down here? Did he fucking have one?

2150
07:27:15,689 --> 07:27:28,409
Am I insane? Where is it? Okay, I want this. I'll give you crystals.

2151
07:28:05,110 --> 07:28:15,159
All right, this is a good troop of people. I need a capital too. Fuck, I do. You're right. I gotta

2152
07:28:15,159 --> 07:28:39,540
kill this person though. They keep sending them up here. What is that? A behemoth? Target enemy's

2153
07:28:39,540 --> 07:28:51,529
defense is reduced by 40%. This is like a chad orc. Not that scary actually. Just go for the

2154
07:28:52,250 --> 07:29:02,889
berserk on the behemoth. Why are they on his legs? Got it, okay, and then we're gonna go right over

2155
07:29:02,889 --> 07:29:27,639
to the magi's. No, yeah, no, that's too close. Down here, the birds. One hit kill. Buff, buff.

2156
07:29:28,840 --> 07:29:50,540
Nice. Titan. Up top. Wolves. Magi. Defend. Ooh, got it. I win again.

2157
07:30:09,930 --> 07:30:20,419
No, I need to make a citadel. Stop making people. Make some genies. All right, that's it. I need a

2158
07:30:20,419 --> 07:30:34,040
citadel. He keeps retreating and you're killing the useless units. Well, the units don't stick around.

2159
07:30:34,680 --> 07:30:41,930
5300. Does this have a citadel? It doesn't have... Okay, I need... I'm gonna have two more capitals

2160
07:30:41,930 --> 07:30:54,860
here. Okay, I just gotta get to 20,000 gold. Everybody leave me the fuck alone. Nobody come

2161
07:30:54,860 --> 07:31:03,930
up here. Purple. I just killed like three of purple's heroes. 10,000. Let's get it right here.

2162
07:31:05,020 --> 07:31:28,040
Capital building. 4,000 gold a day. See you next week. 8,000 now. We're getting there.

2163
07:31:28,759 --> 07:31:34,860
We're getting there and I'm going to stack titans. It's gonna be embarrassing how many I have. At

2164
07:31:34,860 --> 07:31:51,619
least 30. I gotta get the wood. I'll go with this one. It's still mine. Am I gonna do anything with

2165
07:31:51,619 --> 07:31:57,689
the other dude? Yes. Uh, but first I need to get that other building. I need to get a capital in

2166
07:31:57,689 --> 07:32:07,259
that other, uh, castle, so. Imp growth, familiar growth. So I need a capital in here. All right,

2167
07:32:07,340 --> 07:32:17,340
already is one. I can't build more than one capital. Oh shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. I can't do it.

2168
07:32:19,939 --> 07:32:30,040
Shit. Oh well. Oh shit. I don't know. Oh, I need the money though so bad.

2169
07:32:41,380 --> 07:32:51,900
God damn it. Two more titans. I got it. It's still going. I'm not going to bed. No, I don't care.

2170
07:32:57,099 --> 07:33:04,180
Oh god damn it, man. Shit, I can't believe this motherfucker is coming over after me. Oh shit.

2171
07:33:09,130 --> 07:33:21,139
What the fuck am I doing? I got the sulfur for free. I'm just gonna sit here and grind.

2172
07:33:21,939 --> 07:33:28,759
This stream is never going to end. But here's the worst part, guys. Let's say this is like a 12 hour

2173
07:33:28,759 --> 07:33:39,580
stream. Okay. I have to eventually go over here. Otherwise I don't win. You know, understand? I

2174
07:33:39,580 --> 07:33:50,759
eventually everything, all everything ends at Ares. I'm going in there with 50 titans. It's

2175
07:33:50,759 --> 07:33:58,119
the only way to win. I'm telling you, this is the strategy here. All right. Let me, let me hang out

2176
07:33:58,119 --> 07:34:14,540
in here. That's eight titans. I just need money. Look at how much stuff this area to buy. Get the

2177
07:34:14,540 --> 07:34:35,830
reveal map spell? Do I even have one? Oh, it's tax day. Bullshit. Lookout tower. I don't have five

2178
07:34:35,830 --> 07:34:52,069
wood. I have to go on an expedition. It's inevitable. I have to. Anybody up here? I

2179
07:34:52,069 --> 07:35:10,810
don't see anybody up here. I have to go on an expedition. I'm teleporting over here. I can

2180
07:35:10,810 --> 07:35:25,479
always go back. Puzzle pieces. Witch hut. Okay, we got a rally point. Lock up. A thousand experience

2181
07:35:25,479 --> 07:35:51,590
right here. Oh! Uh oh. He ain't gonna come at me. That's the other guy that's really strong.

2182
07:35:52,150 --> 07:35:57,979
No, he's not here. Okay. What can I do? He's not going to come after me. I'm strong.

2183
07:36:12,360 --> 07:36:43,590
I want a new save. Whoa, what? Did Red just kill somebody? Did he just kill Purple?

2184
07:36:44,229 --> 07:36:56,650
What does he have in there? What? Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, what? Oh, he brought a boat.

2185
07:36:56,650 --> 07:37:06,119
He brought a boat. He brought a fucking boat over here. Boat. Not good. I have to turn around, I

2186
07:37:06,119 --> 07:37:13,369
think. But there's an island. But I've already been to this island. What are you doing? Wait,

2187
07:37:13,369 --> 07:37:20,340
but there's an island. Yeah, the middle island. I've been to a thousand times. No, go back. Back,

2188
07:37:20,340 --> 07:37:34,380
back, back, back. Ares is back. Oh my god. Okay, for a second. I thought this was 68 dragons.

2189
07:37:39,060 --> 07:38:03,529
I can take this. I'm thinking of implosion. Implosion on the angels or I wonder on the

2190
07:38:03,529 --> 07:38:19,049
zealots or the archers. Yeah, that was an absolute destructive thing that I just did. Thank god.

2191
07:38:19,049 --> 07:38:36,459
All right. 5200. 40 to 5250. No, I gotta I gotta whittle. I gotta blow you down.

2192
07:38:37,659 --> 07:38:55,909
I don't think I go anywhere. Unless me going. Damn. That was not what I thought was gonna happen.

2193
07:38:56,630 --> 07:39:21,720
Can I buff you? Okay, good. Magic mirror. Who do I throw this at? Angels. Oh, they can fucking fly.

2194
07:39:22,520 --> 07:39:33,000
This is terrible. This is really bad. Angel has to die now. Dragons are dead. I got no more dragons

2195
07:39:33,000 --> 07:39:55,020
anymore. They're gone. We gotta go twice. That sucks. Oh my god. I'm exiting the game. This is

2196
07:39:55,020 --> 07:40:04,020
not part of the plan. Not part of the plan. No, I'm not doing it. I had to fight the one dickhead

2197
07:40:04,020 --> 07:40:30,700
on the in the ocean. Watch this be the only thing he has. Angel's dead. Uh, those things are strong.

2198
07:40:33,020 --> 07:40:52,540
We got 200. Let's just go in the back here. It's gonna be good. 36. Okay, Genie.

2199
07:40:53,419 --> 07:40:57,930
Genie's just he's right in front of you. You have to try and you got nothing.

2200
07:40:59,990 --> 07:41:10,220
15 to eight. You keep going. Nice. All right, if there's something substantial that I get from this,

2201
07:41:10,939 --> 07:41:25,979
then I'm gonna redo it. You know, if I get like the the chest piece of immortality or something,

2202
07:41:25,979 --> 07:41:47,740
then maybe because I'm gonna I think I'm gonna win. Pretty good bait here. That's it for the

2203
07:41:47,740 --> 07:42:14,779
horses. You take care of this. That's it. 10,000 experience. Defense expert learning and nothing.

2204
07:42:14,779 --> 07:42:31,430
Here comes fucking Ares. Um, here's the thing though. This is I could get rid of red.

2205
07:42:32,150 --> 07:42:44,360
I could delete red right now. I don't think red has another castle.

2206
07:42:47,939 --> 07:42:53,209
This is empty. There's nothing in here. Unless unless there's something down here.

2207
07:42:55,860 --> 07:43:06,860
No, that's not part of the plan. Load game. This is before I even teleported over, right?

2208
07:43:07,580 --> 07:43:22,060
No, it's not. What the hell is going on? No, wrong one. Okay, so this is where I I'm gonna go back.

2209
07:43:22,619 --> 07:43:36,840
We're gonna teleport back. So then if I don't do that, let's see where the timeline is.

2210
07:43:38,650 --> 07:43:47,990
He still gets in the boat. Red is now here, which now red is gonna end up potentially taking this

2211
07:43:47,990 --> 07:44:01,240
castle. At least I got the resources. All right, teleport over here to walk. Okay, so get up here.

2212
07:44:01,880 --> 07:44:21,560
Back it up. Really want more dragons, but I don't think don't have any access to them.

2213
07:44:22,200 --> 07:44:34,919
It sucks. What do I have access to over here? Unfortunately, it's the same place. It's the same

2214
07:44:34,919 --> 07:44:49,419
place. It's not different. I'm gonna have to just like master gremlins, naga queens. I mean,

2215
07:44:49,419 --> 07:45:07,189
I'm gonna have to do something here. I could send somebody down here, but he's here. I really want

2216
07:45:07,189 --> 07:45:16,759
that back. There's nothing there except he's here. He's got dragons. Double of the same production

2217
07:45:16,759 --> 07:45:26,520
is not bad. No, that's not. Yeah, that's true. I'm gonna send a scout out next week. I'm gonna

2218
07:45:26,520 --> 07:45:44,759
send a scout out to try to get blue. At least that castle on the right. And I'll start him here and

2219
07:45:44,759 --> 07:45:50,500
get him, try to get him down here. There's nothing, there's nobody here. I can just get that back.

2220
07:45:51,060 --> 07:46:08,790
Or this one for day five. Still have the dragons. Titans. I'll have 10 titans. Still have all this

2221
07:46:08,790 --> 07:46:20,360
stuff up here. All right, let's go. Let's do that plan. Here we go. Wizard or Death Knight. He has

2222
07:46:20,360 --> 07:46:33,580
an artifact. What is it? What's the artifact? Knowledge and power by three. Let's give you

2223
07:46:33,580 --> 07:46:41,849
just a couple of these things to go out with. I will keep the other ones that are for this building

2224
07:46:41,849 --> 07:47:00,540
here. Go out this way. Grab a boat. Get the hell out of here. Basic scouting. This one definitely.

2225
07:47:05,240 --> 07:47:10,090
Arena. This is where I get some points. I'm not gonna move. I'm gonna stay here.

2226
07:47:11,849 --> 07:47:17,380
Oh, fuck. He's coming my way. What does he got? Is this the same red that I fought before? I beat

2227
07:47:17,380 --> 07:47:49,560
him. Yep, it is. All right, well, I'm getting in. I need a new hero. I might have to meet you halfway.

2228
07:47:50,919 --> 07:48:01,799
I think I'm gonna have to meet them halfway. Yep, I'm gonna focus the zealots. We're not on,

2229
07:48:01,799 --> 07:48:17,819
there's no planks here. No, I, you know, I'll make another, I'll make another hero.

2230
07:48:18,619 --> 07:48:32,659
And I'm gonna send this hero off. Absolutely this one. One knowledge. Okay, so then let's give you

2231
07:48:32,659 --> 07:48:37,540
this. I'm gonna give you something. I'll give you some something just to get this to be out there

2232
07:48:37,540 --> 07:48:55,400
and just be alright. Back it in here. I want you behind the walls. You need to go recruit shit.

2233
07:48:56,040 --> 07:49:04,069
Find your way around. Just walk by this guy. And I need to get in the boat and I'm gonna go down.

2234
07:49:04,869 --> 07:49:12,060
I'm gonna go down here. I want nothing to do with you, man.

2235
07:49:12,060 --> 07:49:30,250
All right, same deal with you. Down this way. Here we go. Let's see what happens.

2236
07:49:30,250 --> 07:49:33,130
He's coming in for a fight. All right, he wants to get rid of this guy. All right, well, this is

2237
07:49:33,130 --> 07:49:41,560
good bait. This is really good bait. I'm okay with this. It gets rid of the centaurs and it

2238
07:49:41,560 --> 07:49:58,569
makes him not attack the house. Everyone's just gonna die. This is wasted money. I know. Fuck,

2239
07:49:58,569 --> 07:50:12,060
you're right. I just... I didn't think he was gonna fucking... I thought he was gonna...

2240
07:50:12,060 --> 07:50:20,709
I didn't think he was gonna fucking come back and kill me. I thought he was gonna...

2241
07:50:22,150 --> 07:50:35,000
Okay, he's gonna go back to back. Back to back and kill everybody. Hey, remember that money that I

2242
07:50:35,000 --> 07:50:43,799
lost? I'm just... I got... I can't even... I shouldn't even spend any money on any other towns

2243
07:50:44,759 --> 07:50:51,000
because this is not possible to beat unless I have an equal or better force, which I can't do.

2244
07:50:51,959 --> 07:50:58,090
I can't. It's... I can't do it. I have to... I'm gonna... I don't give a shit. Just take it all.

2245
07:50:59,209 --> 07:51:16,869
I'm gonna just turtle the fuck out of one place and just get 25 titans and then win. Damn it.

2246
07:51:17,430 --> 07:51:29,750
I need to stop, like, putting money into three or four different places. I just need to do it

2247
07:51:29,750 --> 07:51:47,299
in one place. This whole... this same scenario is gonna play out over and over again. Or I just

2248
07:51:47,299 --> 07:52:03,529
lose because he keeps going to the capital. God damn it. Let's... I want to see what happens.

2249
07:52:03,529 --> 07:52:17,159
I made, like, three other heroes. I should have just sat in my fucking castle and just banked

2250
07:52:17,159 --> 07:52:51,110
money and then had, like, a bunch of people. I'm making that same mistake again. Well, the only

2251
07:52:51,110 --> 07:52:54,790
reason why I thought I was gonna win is because I thought Ares was stuck forever, but then it

2252
07:52:54,790 --> 07:53:03,029
didn't matter because then Red decided to grow a brain and move from this island to over here.

2253
07:53:03,750 --> 07:53:21,419
It's taken him eight hours to get here. What were you doing all this time? All right, let's see.

2254
07:53:21,419 --> 07:53:31,450
Let's... let's check this new scenario. Let's see what happens now. I need to, like, build this

2255
07:53:31,450 --> 07:53:38,619
place up. All right, this is what I was doing, right? Naga Queens. I can now make them here,

2256
07:53:38,619 --> 07:53:51,500
which is good. I can now get them to be made here. I'm going to do Cloud Temple. So I need

2257
07:53:51,500 --> 07:54:07,659
Author of Wishes. I don't have... I have no money to make anything else. What did I just say? No,

2258
07:54:07,659 --> 07:54:12,700
no, no, but I... but I made... I made, like, three new heroes. I spent, like, almost 10 grand on new

2259
07:54:12,700 --> 07:54:22,810
heroes. I'm not doing that. I'm just spent... like, I'm just trying to recruit people now. You know

2260
07:54:22,810 --> 07:54:37,479
what I mean? Like, see, I can have... make the genies. And now we go again. I've got a plan,

2261
07:54:37,479 --> 07:54:45,459
and his same scenario. He keeps coming back. All right, I can do this now. Author of Wishes,

2262
07:54:45,459 --> 07:54:56,099
and then we can do them here. Now I can make upgraded genies. And by the way, like, delete

2263
07:54:56,099 --> 07:55:10,659
this guy. What is that? What... that guy serves no purpose. All right, even more. And then we're

2264
07:55:10,659 --> 07:55:20,520
going to dump them together, and this guy's going to just ride his horse off a cliff, for all I care.

2265
07:55:20,520 --> 07:55:46,869
Okay, looks all right. Okay, let's go. Save it. Okay, here we go. So here comes Red. If I'm behind

2266
07:55:46,869 --> 07:55:59,180
my walls, he won't kill me. Here comes Ares. Everyone is recruited from here. This place is

2267
07:55:59,180 --> 07:56:09,419
looking all right. Okay, now Cloud Temple. I need 5,000 gold. I also need 10 wood, 10 ore, and 10

2268
07:56:10,139 --> 07:56:17,830
marbles. So I just need some wood. And then we can start generating titans here. So let's just make

2269
07:56:17,830 --> 07:56:28,069
as many of these as we can. I have to cash right now. I kind of have to get out here. If he... I

2270
07:56:28,069 --> 07:56:34,500
kind of have to get out and, like, get the wood again. All right, first of all, get in the castle,

2271
07:56:34,500 --> 07:56:40,819
because if he comes over to the castle, I'm going to die. So what do I do with these? I said I wasn't

2272
07:56:40,819 --> 07:56:56,869
going to make another hero. Do I just delete them? I think I have to just delete them. Yeah, I have

2273
07:56:56,869 --> 07:57:08,279
to dismiss them. I'm not going to use them. Sell them for resources. Yeah, that's a good idea.

2274
07:57:09,080 --> 07:57:26,389
Where is that building? Where is that building? Do I even have it here? Resource silo? No.

2275
07:57:27,349 --> 07:57:51,290
What is it called? Do I have it in this town? No, the tavern. Um, a blacksmith? No. I don't think I

2276
07:57:51,290 --> 07:57:56,630
have it here. Stronghold is the only faction that gets a building to sell units. Ah, damn it.

2277
07:57:57,590 --> 07:58:04,340
It's only on the orc stronghold. Well, oh well. Wait, what? What do you mean I do have it?

2278
07:58:05,060 --> 07:58:25,000
Where is it? No, just kidding. Thanks. Skeletons aren't worth it. Just delete the skeletons?

2279
07:58:25,560 --> 07:58:37,799
I feel like the skeletons can be pretty good sometimes, though. It's not worth making a new

2280
07:58:37,799 --> 07:58:42,700
hero and just having him just go die. I'm just gonna dismiss them. I'm just gonna dismiss them.

2281
07:58:47,610 --> 07:59:01,509
Three, two, one. I'm doing it. Has chap been right before? Quite a few times, actually. Yeah, they

2282
07:59:01,509 --> 07:59:11,689
have. They've been right before. Okay. How are we doing here? I need wood. I'm gonna take back the

2283
07:59:11,689 --> 07:59:38,709
fucking wood. Where is he? Go get wood. I need this. Just don't pop out of nowhere and kill me.

2284
07:59:39,430 --> 07:59:50,150
You know how upset I'll be if that happens? I don't have the new, the new genie, right?

2285
07:59:51,540 --> 07:59:59,560
I can get these guys. Okay. Starting to build a decent army on the other side here. No, no, no,

2286
07:59:59,560 --> 08:00:19,180
no, no, no, no. I can beat them. I'm gonna go hard on the zealots. The angels, they have so many

2287
08:00:19,180 --> 08:00:28,099
good fucking units. I think it's go hard on zealots. Start off with implosion on the zealots

2288
08:00:33,110 --> 08:00:53,540
or should I berserk? Berserk the zealots? There's so many options. Either berserk the zealots,

2289
08:00:53,540 --> 08:01:07,060
implode the zealots. How's their attack? 10 to 12, 7 to 10, 2 to 3, 15 to 25. I could do that.

2290
08:01:08,020 --> 08:01:24,220
They do way more damage. Yeah, I think I'm gonna berserk the, um, the capital right here. They do

2291
08:01:24,220 --> 08:01:32,569
more damage. And then I'm just gonna go hard on the zealots. With dragon and with titan.

2292
08:01:50,310 --> 08:01:56,470
Ah! Get out of here! You're ruining everything! Because I'm gonna deplete all my fucking forces

2293
08:01:56,470 --> 08:02:07,560
on this! This is like the same thing that happened. Except at a different part of the map. They just,

2294
08:02:08,119 --> 08:02:13,560
I just don't, I didn't do it. It was the first three hours of the game. I just didn't get

2295
08:02:13,560 --> 08:02:16,759
everything in the right position. I was still trying to learn and remember how to play.

2296
08:02:17,479 --> 08:02:26,500
And I fucking peed on myself. All right, well, get up here. I at least need to have somebody fight.

2297
08:02:45,240 --> 08:02:51,290
And then I'm back to square one again. And then there's two or three other people that have

2298
08:02:51,930 --> 08:02:59,240
huge armies. I think this is a retreat and give up. I think I'll lose here. I don't think it's

2299
08:02:59,240 --> 08:03:13,750
possible that I can win. Even if I beat this, I, what am I gonna do? I'm behind in troops and

2300
08:03:13,750 --> 08:03:22,419
resources by like a hundred percent. I can win this fight, but then we start all over again where

2301
08:03:22,419 --> 08:03:46,810
it's like, oh, here comes Ares with his 30 dragons. I'm fucked. Well, it was fun. Use spells? I couldn't

2302
08:03:46,810 --> 08:03:51,529
use spells. This is the first round I've been able to use spells up until last time. We're

2303
08:03:51,529 --> 08:04:14,569
going to berserk again. Let's berserk the angels, get rid of them, fight each other, kill each other.

2304
08:04:15,369 --> 08:04:36,299
Okay. Good. So put the skeletons. That's perfect. Very good. Go carve up the angel. This is a

2305
08:04:36,299 --> 08:05:02,020
victory. He's melted the skeletons. Holy shit. Kind of in trouble here. Whoa. Well, that's not good.

2306
08:05:07,290 --> 08:05:26,279
Angel's dead. I'm going to wrap back around here and they retreated. 10,000 experience. I used

2307
08:05:26,279 --> 08:05:35,180
blind. Cannot move, cause a counterattack at half its normal attack strength. Let's get expert

2308
08:05:35,180 --> 08:05:47,180
learning. So now I, what the hell am I going to do now? I need more Titans. Crystals back here.

2309
08:05:50,259 --> 08:06:06,979
Two more Titans. Oh, they can only get one. I feel like we are probably going to be in a never-ending

2310
08:06:06,979 --> 08:06:24,490
loop. I'm almost certain of it actually. Epic 72 hour campaign. Now I'm essentially treading water

2311
08:06:24,490 --> 08:06:33,430
at this point because they just has so much great stuff. I'm going to give it like another week

2312
08:06:33,430 --> 08:06:46,680
or a couple of weeks and we'll see. Cause I just not really generating enough money.

2313
08:06:47,400 --> 08:06:55,830
And if I send people, it's almost like I'm constantly swimming upstream. And I think, yeah,

2314
08:06:55,830 --> 08:07:00,779
I just have to, I think I just have to take somebody. I got, I'm going to get, I'll get 10

2315
08:07:00,779 --> 08:07:06,250
Titans. And I think I just have to, I have to go down here and just try to steal something. Just

2316
08:07:06,250 --> 08:07:15,049
try to get something. Let us recruit what we can recruit. And then I'm going to go from there. So

2317
08:07:15,049 --> 08:07:30,840
let's do it. There are 18 of these over here. So what I'm going to do, I'm, what am I going to do

2318
08:07:30,840 --> 08:07:38,220
here? Let's just see, let's just see what happens. We've been going for like over eight hours now.

2319
08:07:38,220 --> 08:07:45,380
It's probably time to wind it down. It's like midnight Pacific. I'm like too addicted to being

2320
08:07:45,459 --> 08:07:50,500
in a never ending circle, but it's all good. Let's do this. I'm just going to recruit

2321
08:07:51,060 --> 08:08:11,509
whatever's left here and then I'm going to head down. I need to wait a day. Of course it's tax day.

2322
08:08:12,310 --> 08:08:35,900
That's great. 10 Titans. There we go. I hate that. There's still a few more in here. I've got to

2323
08:08:35,900 --> 08:08:47,369
wait. I can, if I'm going to give it a real try, I'm going to wait, go until a year has passed.

2324
08:08:48,090 --> 08:08:55,860
That'll be like another, probably eight and a half hours. It's month six. I don't think

2325
08:08:55,860 --> 08:09:21,819
I'm going to do that. All right. Wizards. All right. Almost ready to go. I'm actually going to

2326
08:09:21,819 --> 08:09:33,290
bring the other Naga Queens over. Don't even tell me he's fucking coming to get me. Oh,

2327
08:09:33,290 --> 08:09:59,939
this is you motherfucker. No, let me have my, don't you dare. I need to like deliver these guys. Oh,

2328
08:09:59,939 --> 08:10:09,209
God damn it. I need to just deliver people to here. Just do something else for a minute.

2329
08:10:11,479 --> 08:10:17,529
Do not come over here. Just do anything else for fucking five seconds. One more turn. Don't even

2330
08:10:17,529 --> 08:10:38,419
come over here. Thank, what? Special goddamn delivery. What happened? He's got 21 dragons and

2331
08:10:38,419 --> 08:10:44,259
a hundred liches, a hundred trees. This was never winnable anyway. He's just progressively

2332
08:10:44,259 --> 08:10:49,139
gotten better and I've been treading water. No, it's not possible, but I'm going to go out with

2333
08:10:49,139 --> 08:10:52,900
a bang and he's going to come get me and I'll let him take the fucking castle like a goddamn.

2334
08:11:07,130 --> 08:11:25,130
He's unbeatable. Come on, let's do it. And end by like eight to 10 hours streamer with me being

2335
08:11:25,130 --> 08:11:46,659
fucking humiliated. Let's go. I'm going to sit up here. They have too many. He's right outside

2336
08:11:46,659 --> 08:12:58,409
the castle. This is it. It's over. He's going to take his, his cheating dragons. Is there,

2337
08:12:58,409 --> 08:13:02,250
is there a way after this match is over? Can I go like to a replay and see how the fuck you got

2338
08:13:02,250 --> 08:13:56,139
these? Why would it be a reaction? Yeah, I know. Aha. You lost a unicorn. He's not even going to

2339
08:13:56,139 --> 08:14:13,110
come get me, is he? All right. I'll just be a piece of shit. What are you going to do?

2340
08:14:13,830 --> 08:14:22,860
You're going to come get me? This is it. The last stand before I actually lose.

2341
08:14:23,819 --> 08:14:31,139
I lose the game. Oh, this is so sad. This is so sad to me. I was so pumped and excited.

2342
08:14:31,139 --> 08:14:38,540
I have to get my revenge. I have to get my revenge tomorrow. I've, I'm so sad. I'm very sad right now.

2343
08:14:38,540 --> 08:14:52,330
I actually really am. Damn it. I really thought I had it. Okay. All right. This is fun. This was

2344
08:14:52,330 --> 08:15:07,259
fun. It was. Who do I even, what do I even do here? Berserk on. I can't even do that. I have to

2345
08:15:07,259 --> 08:15:11,979
implode somebody or let me try one of the other. No, no, no. You know what? Let's get an earth

2346
08:15:11,979 --> 08:15:25,619
elemental out here. Oh, this thing sucks. Nevermind. Going for the dragon. Holy shit.

2347
08:15:26,340 --> 08:15:34,950
Wow. Wait a minute. Wow. That was very, very, very, very good. Should I go out there and kill

2348
08:15:34,950 --> 08:16:00,380
the dragon? Six dragons dead. Waste. No, he's just got too many good. I could kill, at least let me

2349
08:16:00,380 --> 08:16:30,810
kill the dragons. Let me just get rid of these dragons. I hate them. All right. Titans. Five

2350
08:16:30,810 --> 08:16:39,860
dragons perish. What's going on? Oh, you're dispelling all the mines. That's kind of ridiculous.

2351
08:16:41,380 --> 08:16:46,490
If I kill the bone dragons, this is a victory. There's only, there's only four left.

2352
08:16:47,209 --> 08:17:07,880
I win. That's a victory for me. No, not my city. Not my capital.

2353
08:17:07,880 --> 08:17:15,020
Oh, I want to play again. This time I'm going to do much better and I'm going to be prepared,

2354
08:17:16,060 --> 08:17:43,349
but not tonight. 23. I will come back stronger. There goes everything. Is that me?

2355
08:17:44,630 --> 08:18:03,590
No, what? They even do this to you? That sucks. Oh, no, it hurts. I'm like actually,

2356
08:18:04,549 --> 08:18:29,689
ugh. No, I'm not doing round two right now. I'm just going to have, I'm going to have mayhem

2357
08:18:29,689 --> 08:18:40,119
for tomorrow. Team alignments. No teams. Maybe we should do teams. What do you think? Tomorrow

2358
08:18:40,119 --> 08:18:56,759
should be like four on four. Eight teams. Large map. Cause I mean, obviously it's eight people.

2359
08:18:57,639 --> 08:19:03,049
I'm going to keep it at that 130%. I think that's, that's good. It's fair.

2360
08:19:04,889 --> 08:19:19,619
Monster strength. What was it? It was on strong and it's a random map template.

2361
08:19:22,069 --> 08:19:39,419
Normal water. Or should we do pre-made scenarios? You have to prove. No water means no boats to

2362
08:19:39,419 --> 08:19:47,819
worry about. That's true. Always build second level rebuild library. I don't know what that means.

2363
08:19:48,939 --> 08:19:59,799
This is all. We can do this tomorrow. We'll set it up. Uh, yeah, that's going to be it. Unfortunately,

2364
08:19:59,799 --> 08:20:09,979
uh, I ran around in a circle for the last like three hours, but it was still a lot of fun. It's

2365
08:20:09,979 --> 08:20:20,040
exactly like I remember. I have a sour taste in my mouth, but I will turn it into sweet candy

2366
08:20:21,000 --> 08:20:35,060
tomorrow. Going for a win tomorrow. And then after tomorrow, after tomorrow, I am going to

2367
08:20:35,060 --> 08:20:39,380
take a little bit of time off. I have to do my colonoscopy. I'm going to be kind of miserable

2368
08:20:39,380 --> 08:20:47,029
over the next few days. I'm not going to be able to eat very much, but that will be it.

2369
08:20:47,029 --> 08:20:53,240
I will see you tomorrow around the same time between three and four Pacific. Thank you for

2370
08:20:53,240 --> 08:21:00,889
watching. This was Heroes of Might Magic 3, an old favorite of mine. Hopefully you guys thought

2371
08:21:00,889 --> 08:21:05,049
it was fun because I know there was maybe people said, oh, maybe not. I wonder. I've never seen

2372
08:21:05,049 --> 08:21:14,060
that before. Is it boring? Is it not boring? But I think we definitely can do another stream on this

2373
08:21:14,700 --> 08:21:21,540
and we'll do it tomorrow. This game is fucking awesome. It's very fun. It's very intense

2374
08:21:22,259 --> 08:21:29,819
and I will see you tomorrow for the next part. Thanks again for watching. We're going to do the

2375
08:21:29,819 --> 08:21:37,430
bits and subs when I return because I need to use the bath. I'm not going to pee. Much love to you

2376
08:21:37,430 --> 08:24:03,779
if you take it off. Maybe you'll step by tomorrow. See you soon. I'll be right back. Okay, so let's go

2377
08:24:03,779 --> 08:24:16,409
back to a long time ago, almost a whole day away. We're going to go back to Gnarly. Thanks for the

2378
08:24:16,490 --> 08:24:24,459
six dollars. Gnarly 62. Thanks man. Appreciate the comfort. My pleasure. Thanks for watching.

2379
08:24:25,020 --> 08:24:37,000
Thank you for the six dollars. Appreciate it. Thank you. Some guy. Thanks for the 15 dollars.

2380
08:24:37,000 --> 08:24:56,619
I don't have any message. Here's a dog. A dog. Is it a dog running after a guy? That's not Otto.

2381
08:24:57,259 --> 08:25:06,169
No, it's a different dog. Show Otto. No, Otto I think is probably asleep because it's

2382
08:25:06,169 --> 08:25:18,919
midnight. I don't think Otto is awake at the moment. Otto attacking Ares. Nah, let Otto sleep.

2383
08:25:18,919 --> 08:25:28,169
Otto doesn't need to be awoken. But thank you for the 15 dollars some guy. Thanks. Appreciate the dog

2384
08:25:28,169 --> 08:25:38,549
run video. Thank you. Thank you warm like biscuits for the 10 bucks. 15 dollars and 10 dollars right

2385
08:25:38,549 --> 08:25:43,930
after earlier today. Jerm, I've been watching you since early TF2 days and I have to thank you for

2386
08:25:43,930 --> 08:25:48,090
all the laughs and joy you have brought me through the years. I've had pretty dark nights and your

2387
08:25:48,090 --> 08:25:58,729
videos always made them a little easier. So thank you. Thank you. I love Team Fortress. I loved

2388
08:25:58,729 --> 08:26:05,419
making YouTube videos. I'm very very happy that people enjoyed them and thought they were fun

2389
08:26:05,419 --> 08:26:11,669
and may have helped them forget about some shit in their life. You know what I'm saying? That's

2390
08:26:14,970 --> 08:26:18,889
that means a lot. Thank you for the 10 dollars. Thank you for the fucking incredibly kind message.

2391
08:26:24,180 --> 08:26:32,860
Much love to you. Thank you warm like biscuits. Really appreciate it. Multi trip thank you for

2392
08:26:32,860 --> 08:26:43,110
the three bucks. Good god this is such a geeky nerd neck game. It just made me crack my neck to

2393
08:26:43,110 --> 08:26:53,290
make sure that I was not sitting inappropriately. Thank you for the three dollars. Thank you Matt

2394
08:26:54,169 --> 08:26:59,290
P.T. or Piety for the 250. Thrilled to see you playing Heroes of Might and Magic 3. Some of my

2395
08:26:59,290 --> 08:27:04,250
earliest memories as a kid are sitting on my mom's lap and watching her play Might and Magic

2396
08:27:04,970 --> 08:27:10,090
and Heroes of Might and Magic on her computer. Then abusing the hell out of cheats when I started

2397
08:27:10,090 --> 08:27:15,529
playing myself since I was so bad at it. I joined right as you were complaining about losing a battle

2398
08:27:15,529 --> 08:27:21,049
and loaded a save to redo it. That's the German we all know and love. I want to watch from the

2399
08:27:21,049 --> 08:27:28,389
beginning so I'll be checking out the recording later. Keep being a cool guy. Thank you. I do have

2400
08:27:28,389 --> 08:27:34,759
very fond memories of this game but okay maybe we can put uh maybe tomorrow I won't do any

2401
08:27:34,759 --> 08:27:37,240
rewinds but I'm just trying to get back in the swing thing trying to remember how to play the

2402
08:27:37,240 --> 08:27:42,819
game trying to remember how things work. Now I got like a good idea of how things are working again.

2403
08:27:42,819 --> 08:27:50,500
It's been like 15 years. Maybe we don't do rewinds tomorrow. Maybe we just have to accept our fate.

2404
08:27:51,220 --> 08:27:54,380
What is the worst sound of 2019?

2405
08:27:59,189 --> 08:28:09,529
Fight the article that says yeah fight the article that says let me find an article fight the

2406
08:28:09,529 --> 08:28:25,610
article that says yeah what the fuck thank you for the 250 though appreciate it matt

2407
08:28:26,330 --> 08:28:31,139
Freudian weapon thanks for the three bucks cheer 300 no message thank you for three dollars

2408

laps thank you Onicus really appreciate the ten dollars appreciate the support thanks for watching

2411
08:28:53,909 --> 08:29:02,180
for that much time I'm super thankful that people years later still think that this channel is fun

2412
08:29:04,500 --> 08:29:09,060
you know if you watch the same thing for a few years maybe sometimes you can kind of get sick

2413
08:29:09,060 --> 08:29:14,979
of it or something you don't really like anymore so floored that people have been able to think

2414
08:29:14,979 --> 08:29:18,900
this is still fun and cool and interesting over the last few years if you've been around for that

2415
08:29:18,900 --> 08:29:26,709
long or five years whatever you always say you're going then stick around for an hour

2416
08:29:27,349 --> 08:29:32,389
well when a stream ends and this is going to be changing once i have lower down makes the new

2417
08:29:33,349 --> 08:29:40,040
graphics when i say a stream is ending i really mean the stream is transitioning into a

2418
08:29:40,919 --> 08:29:47,240
like 30 to 45 minute hangout session where we just hang out so the stream is technically over

2419
08:29:48,790 --> 08:29:58,040
but it still goes on for a little while yeah yeah it's the game yeah the gaming is done

2420
08:29:59,080 --> 08:30:02,520
and i go through the messages that came through over the course of the

2421
08:30:03,560 --> 08:30:09,880
evening i don't i'm not sure how maybe how new you are or how many streams you've caught but i don't

2422
08:30:09,880 --> 08:30:18,419
read uh subs or donations or anything like that on stream i will stop for something major you know

2423
08:30:18,419 --> 08:30:22,500
if somebody gives you know five ten twenty community subs obviously that's a that's a

2424
08:30:22,500 --> 08:30:27,700
big deal it's a lot of money or like 50 bucks or 100 bucks it's like that's a that's a big deal

2425
08:30:29,130 --> 08:30:34,169
but um for the most part i just can we kind of just do the broadcast and then we do a little

2426
08:30:34,169 --> 08:30:40,259
hangout session afterwards gamer cool down yeah there'll be a new screen this won't say stream

2427
08:30:40,259 --> 08:30:47,700
over uh in a week or so i'll have uh some new graphics some new music so it will not just be

2428
08:30:47,700 --> 08:30:56,650
over it'll say something else but it seems to have been working pretty well over the last couple

2429
08:30:56,650 --> 08:31:04,650
of years i heavily enjoyed i like doing it it takes a lot of the stress and the um kind of

2430
08:31:05,979 --> 08:31:12,259
need to stay on top of things like subs and donations i like this better let's just focus

2431
08:31:12,259 --> 08:31:19,419
on the stream and then have like a good 45 minute session to go over everything how does dna work

2432
08:31:20,060 --> 08:31:29,369
um you swab a thing in your mouth and then you uh import it uh but thank you to profit rocket

2469
08:36:15,860 --> 08:36:27,110
comfortable with these streams do you remember how rare it was when i would have a stream like

2470
08:36:27,110 --> 08:36:33,080
maybe like a year or two ago did i ever have a stream like two years ago that went over four or

2471
08:36:33,080 --> 08:36:44,299
five hours i don't think ever i used to play yeah max four hours but that was a lot of fun

2501
08:41:21,209 --> 08:41:25,830

2502
08:41:25,830 --> 08:41:35,770

manager all right it's open now here we go ready three two one open your presence and there you go

2505
08:41:59,830 --> 08:42:04,709
yips are out what's a colonoscopy colon i'll answer that real quickly before i go

2506
08:42:04,709 --> 08:42:14,860
a colonoscopy is you are put under sedation and they do an endoscopy they do they put a camera

2507
08:42:17,419 --> 08:42:24,220
in a place that sun don't shine and they examine your entire intestinal tract

2508
08:42:26,150 --> 08:42:38,330
they scope your colon yes the elbow all of it yes the whole thing do it without sedation i

2509
08:42:38,330 --> 08:42:42,490
actually didn't want to do it with sedation but this practice that i'm going to i asked him about

2510
08:42:42,490 --> 08:42:51,610
it and they do not do no sedation colonoscopies the reason why i said i didn't want sedation is

2511
08:42:51,610 --> 08:42:56,650
because i've done two sigmoidoscopies before without sedation they don't really do them

2512
08:42:57,369 --> 08:43:08,470
and a colonoscopy is sort of just a sigmoidoscopy 2.0 it's just longer so i've done them before and

2513
08:43:08,470 --> 08:43:24,040
i just i don't like like anesthetic drugs they i think fuck with you but uh we'll see i'm just

2514
08:43:24,040 --> 08:43:27,799
i'm doing it for a couple of reasons there's a preventative reason why i want you know just

2515
08:43:27,799 --> 08:43:34,200
want to make sure i've never really had like a full on complete colonoscopy before it's good to

2516
08:43:34,200 --> 08:43:41,720
do because obviously my condition that i've had over the last decade so a new place i want to

2517
08:43:41,720 --> 08:43:49,029
get re-evaluated i've had some issues the last year so i'm just gonna go in you know do what you

2518
08:43:49,029 --> 08:43:58,540
got to do and i should be fine don't worry about i have the best colon it's the largest colon no

2519
08:43:58,619 --> 08:44:15,220
inch colon you got into my colon that's so stupid somebody wrote that i had i just had a

2520
08:44:16,020 --> 08:44:25,450
monka lul does that exist should i like make that a thing i made that up don't forget that

2521
