00:00:04,339 --> 00:00:10,140
Hey, what's going on everybody? Jerma here lost another bet. Yeah, Jerma loses bets every single one he makes.

2
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:18,640
I bet MLC Stealth that corn grows from trees, like it hangs from trees like an orange, and I have to play this game because I lost it.

3
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:25,339
So what happened was, uh, corns don't grow from trees. In fact, my phone's ringing right now. Hold on, it's my dad. Let me answer it.

4
00:00:25,339 --> 00:00:28,839
Alright, so, take it easy everybody, we'll see you in there.

5
00:00:28,839 --> 00:00:32,479
Hello? Hello?

7
00:00:40,979 --> 00:00:45,479
You didn't think I was fucking Yoda? You didn't think I had a lightsaber like in Star Wars movies? Are you fucking crazy?

8
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:55,789
Oh shit. Look out! It's the George Foreman grills. We gotta take them out. That's a part of this movie.

9
00:00:55,789 --> 00:00:59,789
The George Foreman grills got brains and they came after the hamster clans.

10
00:01:00,289 --> 00:01:04,319
Go mooch!

11
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:10,079

What is this? Let me shoot this guy like right in the face. He's shooting. What is this laser beam?

13
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:25,620
He's shooting at me. Please tell me I can like kill this guy

00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:17,419
There has to be some way you can get me out of this bed, please in the rule book or something

24
00:02:17,539 --> 00:02:19,539
Let me see here, please

25
00:02:20,539 --> 00:02:27,180
Yes, according to section 54t paragraph 3 of the agricultural video games handbook

26
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:34,620
Right when one party accepts any type of corn agreement pertaining to and not exceeding corn corn syrup

27
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:42,460
Corn on the cob. Yeah corn flakes. Yes or corn meal. Yeah, neither party shall dismiss any form of the required conclusion

28
00:02:42,939 --> 00:02:49,939
Less brought before the Cincinnati maze. No, no, no, no, no rip it up. Rip that fucking book up rip that book up

Good work, darling

36
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:28,819
Watch he's gonna ready. He's gonna start talking in a second here. I'm all this dumb shit

37
00:03:28,819 --> 00:03:35,610
I've been saying the last a couple minutes. You'll hear it any second now watch ready when I jump on this

38
00:03:36,169 --> 00:03:38,370
There here he comes. He's gonna start talking

39
00:03:40,979 --> 00:03:42,979
What the hell is that?

40
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:49,599
The giant coffee maker. Oh you want to fuck with the ice coffee machine?

41
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:55,840
How do I wait? I need to scan it find out its weaknesses vulnerable to most weapons

42
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,759
This lumbering behemoth forms its own shield for protection, but will redirect the shield

43
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:07,830
Energy into a power attack. All right, so just attack them. I can destroy this thing, right? Yeah, I can

44
00:04:08,509 --> 00:04:10,430
Don't know if that's doing much

00:04:34,779 --> 00:04:41,180
Gerbil versus coffee machine. You can't write this shit. You can't make a movie. Oh, this isn't moving forgot

00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:46,750
