00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:23,530
Hello, how you doing? Welcome. The next big thing on Twitch. What's up everybody, how you doing?

2
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:31,109
Lagging? Sometimes when I, I don't know why, sometimes when I start my stream, I, it like

3
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:43,530
crashes. I'm gonna figure out why it's doing that. Hmm. Why did I crash? Yeah, that happened, this

4
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:53,799
happened last time. I'm live, right? Yeah, the stream crashes. That's really weird. I don't know

5
00:00:53,799 --> 00:01:02,250
why that happens. Well, I think I'm back. I've got to like, reinstall something. All right. I

6
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:07,739
can't see the chat though. Hold on. Let me see if I can refresh it. That was a little bizarre.

7
00:01:08,459 --> 00:01:18,260
I gotta pop out a new chat now. But anyways, hi. Welcome everybody. That's weird. Uh, gonna be

8
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:29,510
playing Battleship. The new Twitch meta. Lagging Larry here. That's me, Lagging Larry. We're gonna

9
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:39,849
play with, uh, Ludwig. I hope he doesn't even know who that is. Let me see. Huh, let me, I gotta pop

10
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:44,810
my chat back out. Why does my shit crash? What happened? I got a new computer. Maybe that's why.

11
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:51,349
I gotta pop out this chat. Hold on. Sorry. Technical difficulties already.

12
00:01:53,670 --> 00:02:04,260
Barely are. Okay. Millionaire PC. I don't, I don't know what it is. I don't know why it keeps doing

13
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:10,090
it. You know, it's only for the first like five seconds that I'm like flooding my computer's DNS,

14
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:20,490
right? I don't even know what that means. Millionaire Barry. No, I hope you guys are doing

15
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:28,069
well. Uh, I'm very excited for today. I think this is going to be the best stream of the year.

16
00:02:28,069 --> 00:02:30,710
Fuck, I shouldn't have said that. But like, you know what I mean? I'm just fucking around. But you

17
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:41,830
know, uh, let's go ahead. Let's see. Let's see if he's ready. Hey, hey, you there. Go ahead. My

18
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:48,569
stream crashed. I don't know. I don't know if you saw that. Yeah. Stream crashed, but I got it back.

19
00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:51,689
We're back. We're good. Oh, you're back. Everyone's there. Everyone's happy.

20
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:56,810
Dude, my stream just crashes. I don't know why. Like I turn on OBS and my computer freezes.

21
00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:04,889
Oh, wait. Is it, are you adjusting OBS when that happens? Um, no, I like, I'll just, I hit go live

22
00:03:04,889 --> 00:03:11,620
and like my, I drop a ton of frames. Oh shit. Did my computer crash? I think you might have,

23
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:22,300
um, what is it called? Why is C cleaner running? I think of S C D bro. Why is C cleaner running?

24
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:28,300
You got shitty computer disorder over there. You need a better, I need to get you hooked up with

25
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:33,300
like a better computer. Your computer should not do that. I have a great computer though. I just

26
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:38,740
got like a new awesome computer with an extremely overpriced paid, like 30% premium 30 90 in it.

27
00:03:39,379 --> 00:03:43,460
You have a 30 90? Yeah, dude. I paid like, it was, I paid for battleship.

28
00:03:46,219 --> 00:03:50,699
Yeah. But I played other stuff besides, but you know what? This was not a fucking good

29
00:03:50,699 --> 00:03:55,740
spending of money of me at my part. Not at all. Yeah. I played resonable eight is the only game

30
00:03:55,740 --> 00:04:00,620
I've played that has 3d graphics. You should like be mining Bitcoin while you're live or something

31
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:06,969
with that card. You're wasting that. Uh, are you ready for battleship? You ready to do this?

32
00:04:06,969 --> 00:04:11,689
I am ready for battleship. I have a bit of mutiny on my side already. Everyone's on team

33
00:04:11,689 --> 00:04:16,170
German, my chat, which is concerning. Really? Are we in the same game? Did my internet crash?

34
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:22,410
No, it crashed. You're gone. Oh, okay. Yeah. I'll make a new room. That's all right though.

35
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:26,970
Yeah. I don't know what's going on. 30 90 for battleship. Well, it's not like you'll

36
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:33,800
play battleship a lot at least. I mean, you tell me this is like potentially a pretty big deal

37
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:40,300
from what I hear. What? What? Sorry. What? What's a big deal? The battleship is,

38
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:44,459
it could be really fun to play with people on stream, like with friends. Yeah. It'd be fun

39
00:04:44,459 --> 00:04:48,139
for a bit for sure. Yeah, of course. That's what we're doing right now. That's like why we're

40
00:04:48,139 --> 00:04:52,139
hanging out and playing it. It's yeah. Battleship is definitely fun for a little bit. Yeah. I agree

41
00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:57,500
with you. It'd be good. It's like we'll have a good hour for it. Hour. Oh, or two. Yeah. Maybe

42
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:02,779
I was assuming like six. All right. I got a friend code for you, but I'm just going to say it.

43
00:05:02,779 --> 00:05:06,779
I don't want. Should I just type it? I'll type it to you. You could say it really fast and then I

44
00:05:06,779 --> 00:05:18,970
could try to join. No, I don't think I want to do that. I'm typing it to you in discord. Perfect.

45
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:22,329
There you are. All right. So does it show the room code anywhere or can I go over to the actual

46
00:05:22,329 --> 00:05:28,569
stream? I don't see it anywhere, but I don't think there's another way for someone to join battleship.

47
00:05:28,569 --> 00:05:34,139
I don't think so. All right. I think we're good. Just do all right. So those who don't understand

48
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:40,300
how battleship is played very, very complicated game you do is you get five ships. You place them

49
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:45,819
around and then each turn back and forth. Ludwig and I are going to try to kill each other. Sink

50
00:05:45,819 --> 00:05:54,329
our ships. I'm sorry. Are you explaining battleship? Yeah. That makes sense. No, no bets already.

51
00:05:55,290 --> 00:06:04,310
Oh, are you a bit of a gambling man? Let me just snap the camera on. Uh, yeah. All right. But now

52
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:07,990
we haven't even played one game though. You want to do this already. You want to bet all. What do

53
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:13,110
you want to bet? Well, we'll start. Let's just start off like casually, just like with a casual,

54
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:20,230
you know, let's just say five gifted, you know, just a casual breezy. I've gifted subs to the

55
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:25,180
other person's channel, just to the other person's channel or, or, or better yet. I thought you were

56
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:30,939
going to say like 500 bucks. I was like, Holy shit. We're like already going. No, we'll start.

57
00:06:30,939 --> 00:06:36,709
I mean, it's the first match, you know, how about this? I imagine you're not tier three sub to me.

58
00:06:36,709 --> 00:06:42,629
Is that right? That's that's incorrect. I I'm not, I'm not tier sub to tier three. Okay. I'm not

59
00:06:42,629 --> 00:06:47,269
tier three sub to you. The loser tier three subs to the winner for just a month. All right. That

60
00:06:47,269 --> 00:06:52,779
works. Game one. Let's go. Do you have any experience playing this? Well, let me tell you,

61
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:58,649
I'm using, uh, Fredrick Poitier, which try, try to click on him right now on your stream.

62
00:06:58,649 --> 00:07:05,209
You bought this guy. Yeah. I spent money on this. Why did you buy this? It was three dollars.

63
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:09,910
It just changes. You're never gonna, you're never gonna open this game ever again.

64
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:16,069
Yeah. This is no, no, no. Yes, you are. Cause this is, yeah, this is a big deal coming on

65
00:07:16,069 --> 00:07:20,699
Twitch soon. What, what, what? I'm sorry. What do you mean? It's a big deal coming on Twitch.

66
00:07:20,699 --> 00:07:28,410
Like this, you're going to be playing this all the time. I think like battleship. Yeah.

67
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:32,519
Why are people spamming new meta in my chat? All right. You ready?

68
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:36,360
Here's three sub to the other person. Tier three sub to the other person.

69
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:44,420
Let's go. I was just press cancel. All right. So we don't tell each other where we're going,

70
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:48,180
right? Well, no, you're supposed to say the smallest ship where you put it.

71
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:51,699
You suppose you have to say the smallest ship where you put it. Yeah. You have to tell me where

72
00:07:51,699 --> 00:07:57,399
you put your smallest ship. Okay. Small ships going bottom, right? Yeah. Mine's also going

73
00:07:57,399 --> 00:08:22,540
the bottom, right? Okay. Can we rotate? Oh, okay. Yeah. Good luck. Oh, don't cheat. Don't look at

74
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:29,610
anybody's screens. No, of course not. Of course not. I'm not looking at any screens and I have my chat

75
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:36,330
just, just firmly out of my, out of my grip. I'm ready. You ready? I'm prepared. Yeah. Who goes

76
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:46,389
first? I don't even know who that is. I called heads in the air. All right, here we go. Okay.

77
00:08:46,389 --> 00:08:52,250
You lied. You lied. Wait, did you say bottom right? I did say bottom right. Welcome to war.

78
00:08:53,350 --> 00:09:01,659
So did I. Oh, you lied to me. It's more hurtful when you do it. Hey, here's, here's how I know

79
00:09:01,659 --> 00:09:08,700
that this is going to be correct. He went up one square. Fuck with me. No, he didn't. Whatever.

80
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:11,500
Ah, maybe you're saying he went up one square because that's what you did.

81
00:09:15,899 --> 00:09:23,370
A mirror match. He went up three squares. No, he didn't. You're, you're trying to fool me here.

82
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:30,340
You did not go up a square at all. You went left a square. So how do you win by sinking everything,

83
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:35,620
right? You got to, you got to sink my destroyer, my battleship, my star command. You got to sink

84
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:38,659
everything. All right. This is, this is for a tier three sub, right? I don't want to fuck around

85
00:09:38,659 --> 00:09:47,000
anymore. This is a tier three. This is $25. Yeah. Come on. You don't do this like, you don't do this

86
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,379
like a puzzle where you do the edges first and then you go in the middle when you're like ready.

87
00:09:52,379 --> 00:09:56,539
German, it's a, it's a children's game. You just click a random square and then occasionally you

88
00:09:56,539 --> 00:10:02,379
hit. I mean, honestly, you'll probably do as well if you just don't even know what you're doing.

89
00:10:02,379 --> 00:10:05,100
If you do it blind, if you get like a monkey to do it, you probably have more success.

90
00:10:06,779 --> 00:10:10,460
I mean, you thought, you thought I was in like the edges there. You know, I thought you were

91
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:15,580
a corner Karen. Yeah. Oh, what do you think? I'm crazy. The way you do the thing where you

92
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:20,039
put all your ships in one corner. That's how you instantly lose this game. I know that at least

93
00:10:20,759 --> 00:10:29,590
you got, well, you got one for the corner. Apparently you're a bit of a corner Karen,

94
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:33,990
but you get to go twice. What's this bullshit? You go until you miss. What?

95
00:10:35,429 --> 00:10:39,190
There's no way I hated that shit. When I used to play basketball with people one on one,

96
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:42,789
it would be like, Oh, you go until you don't. And if whoever scored gets the ball back and I never

97
00:10:42,789 --> 00:10:47,990
got the ball back, they just scored like 20 times in a row. Yeah. Winter winter stays is kind of

98
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:54,330
hard. Uh, but fortunately for you, it's not like shooting a jump shot here. I'm still shooting in

99
00:10:54,330 --> 00:11:00,169
the dark. You're working your way up towards E 10. I'm a little nervous about my E 10 strategy.

100
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:13,220
E 10 eating this stick. What? It sounds like eating. Well, it's all right. You get one.

101
00:11:14,899 --> 00:11:18,740
Oh yeah. You thought I was, you thought I was doing the thing. Yep. That's it. It was, it was

102
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:24,980
worth it. Yeah. I think you're in the same place. No thing about me is I'll never click where I am.

103
00:11:28,279 --> 00:11:32,840
You're such a corner care. No, no, no, no, no, no. You just have to get the one,

104
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:46,220
you have to get the one that's over there. Oh God. This is your destroyer. Oh no. All right.

105
00:11:47,019 --> 00:11:59,269
Wait, German. No, no, you didn't. It's a tier three. Oh, it's hard. You got one more. We're

106
00:11:59,269 --> 00:12:05,429
sneaking with it. You're not going to fight. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe that last chip will save your day.

107
00:12:06,299 --> 00:12:11,179
I have a feeling you put every ship in the bottom left except for your small one, which you put in

108
00:12:11,179 --> 00:12:14,940
the top right. Yeah. But that would be a stupid strategy that you'd lose every time.

109
00:12:19,799 --> 00:12:24,200
All right. I got it. It's a bit of a stupid strategy. I wouldn't recommend that.

110
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:27,879
Yeah. Well, it was, at least it wasn't for $2,500. It was for 25.

111
00:12:28,919 --> 00:12:38,679
We get in there. We'll get there. Oh no. Oh, oh no. Excuse me. Somebody's right here in the middle.

112
00:12:38,679 --> 00:12:45,179
Yeah. I went for a little, you know, a little middle play. Okay. All right. That's good for me.

113
00:12:45,179 --> 00:12:54,440
This bottom left strategy. Would you have been so foolish? Everyone's calling you a middle Manny.

114
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:58,600
Yeah. Cause you got, you got stuff in the middle. I got a couple of things in the middle. I wouldn't

115
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:06,039
focus on it too much, which what is down here? Oh, that was your four. That was your four ship.

116
00:13:06,039 --> 00:13:10,419
Yeah. It was my French four. I don't know what, I don't know the names of the ships. I just know

117
00:13:10,419 --> 00:13:20,659
how many numbers there are. Okay. So I think you did. I think you, are you not as dumb as I am?

118
00:13:21,379 --> 00:13:26,980
Did you not put anything right next to each other? No, I played this smart. I played this by the book.

119
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:33,879
I made a thing about me is, you know, I come up with strategies. I know you're a chess player,

120
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:42,600
right? Yeah. I'm a, I'm a chess player by trade. So, Oh, found you. Which way are you? I think this

121
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:52,629
is your little guy. Thank you. Nope. Phenomenal guess. Where did you hide this last one? This

122
00:13:52,629 --> 00:14:03,049
is a bit devious. It's a, it's a four, right? Yeah. There's a bit of strategy involved here.

123
00:14:03,049 --> 00:14:08,169
All I need to go is from this point diagonally upwards and then I'll eliminate every single

124
00:14:08,169 --> 00:14:21,289
place. Oh, close. Very close. I don't trust you. I got up. It's a war of attrition right now. You

125
00:14:21,289 --> 00:14:26,360
know what I mean? Like I just got to, you got to spend a million years finding this last one.

126
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:37,940
Well, I have my, my, my tugboat hidden pretty well. I only need to get one ship. Oh, all right.

127
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:46,600
Let's eliminate this. Everyone's screaming. Why? What do you mean? Why? They can only, there's

128
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:53,750
two ways it can go up or down. Oh, this is where, this is where your big guy is right here.

129
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:59,269
I did find my big guy. That's the easiest one to find though. Mathematically.

130
00:14:59,269 --> 00:15:02,179
That's true. You won't find another ship for years.

131
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:07,379
Well, you did put them right next to you. You did the same thing I did. Didn't you?

132
00:15:07,379 --> 00:15:11,379
Well, I had a gap. Yeah. But you saying there's a gap means that there's definitely another ship

133
00:15:11,379 --> 00:15:19,159
right here. Yeah. You did the same thing I did. We have the same board. What?

134
00:15:19,159 --> 00:15:26,759
What? This is really bad. This is really bad. No, it's not. This is really bad.

135
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:31,820
This is really bad. What do you, what do you wait? Did you do this?

136
00:15:34,059 --> 00:15:37,899
What? How do you have two ships that are this big? You have two destroyers?

137
00:15:40,059 --> 00:15:48,860
No. I'm so confused. I was just. You just got to keep shooting your shots captain.

138
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:58,580
Oh, wait a minute. Oh, they're all connected. Oh boy. You're in deep shit. Oh no.

139
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:03,379
Well, actually I have one last trick up my sleeve. Yeah. And I think I know where it is

140
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:11,110
because it's probably exactly where I put mine. You did the same thing, man. That's so funny.

141
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:18,519
Which way? How many are left? There's a one or two. There's only one three ship left and it's

142
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:23,720
either left or right here. And I don't know. Did you, did you, are you as compulsive enough?

143
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:30,840
Oh, that voice. I'm getting low. Were you as compulsive enough to make sure you created the

144
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:36,629
full Tetris line? Right? Like it has to be perfect. Or did you have? That's a good point.

145
00:16:36,629 --> 00:16:47,740
It is. Of course it is. That's such a good point. Where was yours? That's it. Oh, you're devious.

146
00:16:49,269 --> 00:16:53,669
You won. I won the game. Yeah. The greatest comeback of all time.

147
00:16:54,629 --> 00:16:59,110
But you did the same thing that I did and I just, I thought that you were so much smarter than me.

148
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:02,950
That was what I was hoping. That's what I coast off of in my life is that people think I'm smarter

149
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:08,309
than I am and then I'm not. I was hoping I would get there. All right. Well, uh, tier three, tier

150
00:17:08,309 --> 00:17:16,789
three sub. It's a tier three sub. It's a tier three sub to you. I'm sending it over. There goes my

151
00:17:16,789 --> 00:17:22,069
tier two. Here's where I, where, where I am kind of concerned about this. So I'm assuming we're

152
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:27,210
probably exponentially going to increase this number. Oh, did I really just blow it in the

153
00:17:27,210 --> 00:17:34,890
first round? Like, Oh, I won. I won the first round. Yeah. You won the lowest stakes game.

154
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:39,609
Yeah. So when we get to like, Oh yeah, we're going to do this for $5,000, which I hope we

155
00:17:39,609 --> 00:17:44,410
don't do that because I don't know if I have that, but you know, I don't win that one. I'm,

156
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:51,769
I leave the battleship casino with $4,995 in the hole, whatever it is.

157
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:57,779
That's exactly what's going to happen. Yeah. To a T. All right. You ready for the next one?

158
00:17:57,779 --> 00:18:03,299
That was a good warmup. I I'm trying to subscribe. I I've found out that I can't now. I think,

159
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:13,980
I think someone gifted me a tier three, but that's been paid. I'm going to gift a tier three back

160
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:20,039
gift to tier three. Yeah. Cause I've been tier. Someone got there before I could get there.

161
00:18:20,039 --> 00:18:26,630
That's so funny. All right. Let me make sure that the room codes are not here.

162
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:32,900
I imagine if we just hit rematch, it should be, okay. This was somebody, somebody just invited

163
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:39,049
me to a game. I've never heard of this name. Uh, is this a dumb question? Do you only have

164
00:18:39,049 --> 00:18:46,410
one scene on your Twitch OBS? Well, I've, this is why I have multiple scenes, but what, who the,

165
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:52,569
who the fuck is Cleven? Are you, that's me. That's you. We just played a game together.

166
00:18:52,569 --> 00:19:00,710
I'm Cleven. What? I thought this was like a steam user. Like, like, no, Cleven's my real name.

167
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:08,059
Wait, what? Cleven's my, it's, well, it's actually my middle name, but I went by it for a while.

168
00:19:08,059 --> 00:19:15,210
I thought that was the name of your, your, your, like your guy. How did you know that?

169
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:19,480
I was hoping you wouldn't know that. Yeah. Cleven. I don't know where Cleven,

170
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:24,259
Cleven's a random name I made for a rust server eight months ago on my steam. And I've kept it

171
00:19:24,259 --> 00:19:30,099
there ever since. Wait, what the fuck? I was like, who is Cleven? I'm Cleven Ballsworth.

172
00:19:30,099 --> 00:19:36,200
Is that actually what you went by? Cleven Ballsworth? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I thought it

173
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:40,440
was somebody like was spammed Kevin really quickly. And they were like, I got to get in this game.

174
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:46,150
Like, Cleven. He's just trying to, they just got really like, just hastily fucked up the name

175
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:53,559
Kevin. What is, uh, hold on. I'm buying a, I'm buying a new one. You've, okay. Hold on. Wait,

176
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:57,240
wait, wait. You've spent, have you spent more money on the game than you have giving me a tier

177
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:03,289
three sub? I gifted you a tier three. Ah, you just got just buying shit. All right. I'm sticking

178
00:20:03,289 --> 00:20:08,069
with, um, this guy. I don't know. Here's the thing. I was playing a Frenchman, which is just

179
00:20:08,069 --> 00:20:17,849
brain dead in war. Oh, by the way, soda pop or tonic. Which one are you? Soda pop or tonic.

180
00:20:17,849 --> 00:20:25,059
Soda. 100%. Okay. Yeah. Good. Good. I'd imagine where you're, so I'm from New Hampshire. Oh yeah.

181
00:20:25,059 --> 00:20:33,660
All right. So I imagine we have similar. All right. Let's, let's do this. How do you say the area

182
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:39,900
where you, uh, like a, in a house, like a sectioned off area, R O O M. How do you say that?

183
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:47,430
It's a living room. And then just without the living part. Room. Me too. Yeah. I get a little

184
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:50,869
trash for that for not going room. Yeah. I don't know. But people always give me shit for saying

185
00:20:50,869 --> 00:20:57,740
other stuff too. What are the, what are the other stuff? Room. Oh, okay. Wait, wait, wait. Um,

186
00:20:57,740 --> 00:21:05,180
what do you put your clothes in? Dryer. Okay. You take them out of the, okay. Take them out. Okay.

187
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:09,420
You wash your clothes. You dry them. You take them out of the dryer and you put them in a.

188
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:16,779
I feel like this is a trivia test now in a, in a, are you looking for the word hamper? No, no, no.

189
00:21:16,779 --> 00:21:19,980
That's what happens when your clothes are dirty. You've washed them. You've dried them. I've washed

190
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:25,380
them. I dried them. I put them away. Now you put them away in your. Well, usually in my, in my,

191
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:32,250
in my closet. Okay. But like, uh, how do I, what's the thing that you, what's the thing that you pull?

192
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:41,400
Oh, now you fucked it up. You say draw, draw, draw. It's a draw. You're not saying the full thing.

193
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:46,839
You're giving up halfway through. Oh, I gotta go to my draw. Open up, open up that draw.

194
00:21:47,799 --> 00:21:49,880
But you're not, you're not, you know, you're not finishing the sentence.

195
00:21:51,589 --> 00:22:01,769
Whatever. You're just saying draw. Draw. Yeah. My, my draw. How do you, do you say underwear like that?

196
00:22:01,769 --> 00:22:07,859
Underwear. You don't go my drawers. Underwear. Underwear. Just underwear. Okay. Yeah. Underwear.

197
00:22:07,859 --> 00:22:13,529
But it's not, but the thing though, it's not underwear. It's underwear. Right. Are we saying

198
00:22:13,529 --> 00:22:22,150
it underwear? Underwear. Underwear. Am I saying it weird? Am I saying it weird too? You're making me

199
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:27,079
self-conscious about how I'm saying that now. Anyways, dude, New Hampshire, New Hampshire,

200
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:34,230
that's my fucking backyard. That's my backyard. Yeah. I, uh, I'm one of those New Hampshireites

201
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:38,549
that, you know, I'll just associate myself with Boston, even though I got no business.

202
00:22:38,549 --> 00:22:43,140
Yeah. But New England, that's New England, New England, man. Red Sox nation. Yeah. That's what

203
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:47,299
I go for. I go for, I try to take all the teams, all the pride because we don't have much in New

204
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:51,140
Hampshire. So we take what we can get. I like New Hampshire. I think New Hampshire is nice.

205
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:56,339
It's good. You ever go up to pheasant lane mall and no sales tax to buy something?

206
00:22:56,339 --> 00:23:01,960
I live in Vegas, man. We don't gotta worry about that here. I guess that's true. I guess that is

207
00:23:02,039 --> 00:23:08,279
true. No sales tax. Yes, but the income tax. No. Yeah. I think there's no income tax in New Hampshire

208
00:23:08,279 --> 00:23:12,490
as well. Oh, there's not. Yeah. Yeah. But you have to live in New Hampshire, which means you

209
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:20,460
probably develop a heroin addiction. Oh God. What's the mountains? Oh, by the way, I was just like

210
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:27,529
absentmindedly placing stuff. I think this is okay. I've placed, I feel like it's fine. All right. So

211
00:23:27,529 --> 00:23:32,569
what is this for? Are we upping the stakes or are we lowering the stakes? Let's, let's do it. So

212
00:23:32,569 --> 00:23:37,769
last time was a tier three. Let's, let's, let's, I feel warm right now. I'm ready for a,

213
00:23:37,769 --> 00:23:44,410
you know, just like a, like a casual hundred gifted, a hundred gifted subs for this one. Oh God.

214
00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:51,210
What's that? Okay. It's 500, but honestly with the, with the write-offs, you get it all back.

215
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:58,920
Vegas taxes, New Hampshire taxes. We can't go from, we can't go from $25 to 500. Okay. All right.

216
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:02,839
Well, then you give a suggestion. What's a, what's a better escalation and a better escalation would

217
00:24:02,839 --> 00:24:09,240
be two X. So let's, let's do, let's do 50, 50, 50 bucks, which is what? All right. $50. What do

218
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:14,759
you mean? What is it? It's $50. How are we doing subs? Oh yeah. We can do like 10 subs. Okay. 10

219
00:24:14,759 --> 00:24:29,529
subs. Wait. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. That works. I have a new strategy. You do. Oh, okay.

220
00:24:29,529 --> 00:24:37,160
I, are you, okay. There's psychology here. Like, did you do the exact same layout? No. Oh, smart.

221
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:39,960
I thought you were going to do the exact same thing. That's it. There's no reason why I even

222
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:46,920
ever would aim down here. I'm going, I'm going to tell you right now from J one to a 10, just in a

223
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:51,180
diagonal line. It's going to take me too long to find that coordinate. So I'm just going to click

224
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:59,880
here. I'm, I'm marching up diagonally. All right. Like Petco stock prices in 2000. And you just have

225
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:03,640
to find me before I get to your ship. Cause I'm guaranteed to hit one on this path.

226
00:25:07,579 --> 00:25:11,559
Fuck. All right. You found that quick. What do you, what is G three? What are you thinking?

227
00:25:12,359 --> 00:25:15,900
I don't know. I G three was speaking to me. All right. All right. Well,

228
00:25:16,779 --> 00:25:20,619
I'm sure you don't finish this off. You're going to go the wrong direction here. You think so?

229
00:25:20,619 --> 00:25:29,269
Yeah. Why would you have her? I don't know. Cause I thought maybe you put them next to,

230
00:25:29,269 --> 00:25:32,069
I was going to freak you out. I was going to freak out you and like you're insane.

231
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:40,519
It would have been insane, but it was just so, so bold. Oh, I found your super five, whatever

232
00:25:40,519 --> 00:25:46,549
they're called. Destroyer. I think, or maybe it's, yeah, it's a destroyer. Look at that. Look at that

233
00:25:46,549 --> 00:26:01,500
art. Very cool. So if, if I were you, I would be going right here. Nope. Okay. We're, we're,

234
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:07,049
you know, similar areas, but, oh, that's, but that strategy is unfair. Cause you're guaranteed

235
00:26:07,049 --> 00:26:12,119
to hit something. Wait, what are you doing? I tried to be like you. I tried to be like you.

236
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:17,140
You get bold. Sometimes I thought I'd throw a little spice in it. You know, that was pretty

237
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:31,180
spicy. Oh, that was really close. That was, that means it wasn't close at all. Oh, he went the

238
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:41,130
wrong way. I hate going the wrong way. You got to wait for soda. Oh my God. That was actually

239
00:26:41,130 --> 00:26:49,579
really close. Yeah, but that could all be really close. It's a 10 by 10 grid heads. I go right

240
00:26:49,579 --> 00:26:55,000
tails. I go left. I'm going to get, I'm going to let you know, just fun, just for the sake of the

241
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,839
broadcast content quality. It didn't matter which way you went. And I literally told you,

242
00:26:58,839 --> 00:27:04,200
I just actually told you, why did I do that? For some reason, I thought I got the control of the,

243
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:08,180
I thought I got control back. Why did I just tell you? I don't know. I would have kept going

244
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:19,109
left. Yeah. All right. Well, I feel good about that. I'm continuing my, my line. What are you

245
00:27:19,109 --> 00:27:29,099
giggling at? I can't tell. I can't tell if you're trying to. No, dude, don't keep doing that. That's

246
00:27:29,099 --> 00:27:33,579
like a dumb strategy. Don't do that. That's like stupid. Don't keep doing that. You're double

247
00:27:33,579 --> 00:27:40,460
getting me. You don't like being an idiot. That's like not like, don't do it. They double get me.

248
00:27:41,369 --> 00:27:51,660
All right. You'll never get the direction. Yeah. Well, obviously. Uh, here. No, I thought you were

249
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:58,859
laughing at something. You, you've really rattled me here. I think I've got you rattled. Oh, all

250
00:27:58,859 --> 00:28:09,420
right. You went down with it. That's good. Yeah. I went down. I want, I want a little nuts of that.

251
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:15,339
My, if my strategy nets me one ship, this is the biggest waste of time ever. I was going to say

252
00:28:15,339 --> 00:28:23,609
that's like a, that's a one for how many moves is it? Like 15. Yeah. All right. But how big is

253
00:28:23,609 --> 00:28:31,910
this one? Oh, she's a big one. Keep clicking. Keep going. Oh man. Those are your two biggest ones.

254
00:28:32,549 --> 00:28:38,390
Those are the easiest to find. This is good for me because where I have hid my tugboat, it will

255
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:45,880
take you years. Damn it. I thought it was that one. That would have been hard. All right. Last one.

256
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:52,200
And then I've done my line. Okay. Yeah. Well, you know what? Just go the other way. Do the other

257
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:59,910
diagonal. You'll probably get something. I'm sure. I feel like you've word played me a bit here.

258
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:06,519
Maybe you told me right. Cause there's something to the left. No, I think your strategy would work

259
00:29:06,519 --> 00:29:16,140
if you did it the other way. Wait, like a one to J 10. You'd probably hit like five. Oh,

260
00:29:18,569 --> 00:29:29,990
see too. Shit. Okay. Okay. You'll, you're going to fuck up the direction a couple of times here.

261
00:29:29,990 --> 00:29:38,230
Ooh. Ooh. This is the lying better. I mean, yeah, kind of. I'll tell you right now. It's B2.

262
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:42,839
I'll tell you right now. It's B2. I don't think it is. You gotta go up. You gotta go up. Trust me.

263
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:49,029
I'm going to, I'm going to do it. I'm going to trust him. Oh, you got it down left, right.

264
00:29:49,029 --> 00:29:57,720
Never eat soggy waffles. It wasn't even go B2. Trust me there. B2. All right. If it's not B2,

265
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:06,869
then I'm going to be. Oh my God. What the hell? Why did it work? It worked. Honesty. All right.

266
00:30:06,869 --> 00:30:18,039
We'll go B seven. All right. Fuck you. All these information I've given for what feel like a bot

267
00:30:18,039 --> 00:30:27,529
and spy lie lying warfare. All right. So where are your little, where's your little one? My little

268
00:30:27,529 --> 00:30:30,569
one. I will. Do you want me to tell it to you? Cause I can't tell it to you. I can tell you the

269
00:30:30,569 --> 00:30:38,819
row. I will not tell you the exact number. All right. Give me the, give me the row. It's G.

270
00:30:38,819 --> 00:30:48,630
It's G. It has to be with this one. Wait, wait. But if it was two, it would have to be in the middle.

271
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:57,480
I played pick girls. I could go up down. It could go up down. They span because they got it. You

272
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:05,480
gotta have up down, you know, cause it could be G and F or G and H, you know, or I think you're

273
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:14,650
right here. You like, you like pairing things. I do. I like having things together. I like having

274
00:31:14,650 --> 00:31:21,029
things paired up. I just realized I didn't shoot this ship last turn. No, you didn't. I feel like

275
00:31:21,029 --> 00:31:37,720
you would do something like this. Oh, good call. But nope. So it looks like you, okay. You, you

276
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:43,609
actually made a pretty significant map here. You moved around, you have them all scattered out,

277
00:31:43,609 --> 00:31:51,859
like, like, like an actual strategy. I did that too. And it is, it is not be fruited me much.

278
00:31:51,859 --> 00:31:58,900
Well, I mean, we're still, I'm one ship ahead of you. That's, this can change in a second.

279
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:04,089
That is true. That is true. And I did get one of your threes. I feel good about that. It's

280
00:32:04,089 --> 00:32:09,099
whoever's tugboat lasts the longest. This is going to keep escalate. It's going to keep,

281
00:32:09,099 --> 00:32:12,539
doesn't dude, it doesn't matter who wins any of these right now, because whoever wins like the

282
00:32:12,539 --> 00:32:17,500
$500 one, like just wins everything. Anyways, like that. Oh yeah. No, you're a hundred percent

283
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:22,259
right. I just went to Vegas. We were, I was doing like craps, you know, it's the game I like to play

284
00:32:22,259 --> 00:32:28,019
with like a big group of people. And I was betting modestly the entire weekend. And then Sunday

285
00:32:28,019 --> 00:32:32,019
rolled around and I was like, fuck it. I'm, I'm up a couple thousand. So I started betting just

286
00:32:32,099 --> 00:32:36,740
nonsensically. I just started betting like 500. I lost everything. Nothing I did mattered because

287
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:40,980
I knew I was just going to escalate to a point where it was make or break and I broke everything.

288
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:47,259
It was gone. So, so wait, hold on. You were up with thousands of dollars. I was up $4,000.

289
00:32:48,539 --> 00:32:53,349
Come on that you got to do. Come on. And then Sunday rolled around and I wanted to be up more

290
00:32:53,349 --> 00:32:58,869
money. So I just put it, you know, the you play craps ever I've dabbled a few times. I just put

291
00:32:58,869 --> 00:33:09,099
everything on the field, just $4,000, you know, just trying to run it up to a 25 grand. What are

292
00:33:09,099 --> 00:33:12,940
you trying to do? Well, no, I have a, I have a goal because I think if you don't have a goal,

293
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:17,660
it's not stupid. Wait, you go, wait, hold on. You're going into Vegas gambling with a goal

294
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:23,799
of how much money you want of how much money, of what I want to win. Oh my God. That's, that's not,

295
00:33:23,799 --> 00:33:29,079
that's, that's don't do that. I go in with a thousand and I want to leave with a really

296
00:33:29,079 --> 00:33:38,279
nice watch. Oh my God. No, that's good. That's a good thing to do. I mean, if you, if you, if

297
00:33:38,279 --> 00:33:42,599
you're going to give it to you for free because you like hit a jackpot and they go, how about this

298
00:33:42,599 --> 00:33:48,039
watch instead of the 40 grand? I would be like, sign me up. Can I get two? Wait, you would take

299
00:33:48,039 --> 00:33:54,279
the watch over 40 grand? Well, I, well, I get like a really nice roll. I'd get a $40,000 watch.

300
00:33:54,279 --> 00:33:58,869
I don't know. Expensive watches always didn't do it for me. It was always just like somebody come

301
00:33:58,869 --> 00:34:04,809
take this from me. I'm not a watch guy by any means. I just think that getting it for this

302
00:34:04,809 --> 00:34:09,449
occasion would be, would be cool. Cause it'd be like my Vegas watch. And then people would be

303
00:34:09,449 --> 00:34:14,139
like, where'd you get that watch? And I'll be like, do I got a story for you? I'd walk them

304
00:34:14,139 --> 00:34:18,940
through every blackjack and craps table hand. The expensive watch on your wrist is like,

305
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:22,539
you remember in GTA online when somebody became like the bounty and they just showed up on the

306
00:34:22,539 --> 00:34:27,079
mini map. Yeah. It's just like, you're just like showing up on everybody's mini map with this

307
00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:32,760
gigantic, expensive, like $500,000 thing on your hand. Yeah. If I were to leave my house, sure. But

308
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:38,179
you know, it's probably not found. Look at all these empty spaces, these gaps. How have I not

309
00:34:38,179 --> 00:34:44,650
found you? Oh, I miss clicked that. I don't understand where you could even be right here.

310
00:34:45,449 --> 00:34:51,829
I'm eliminating all these one spaces. Yeah. I'm actually wasting my time up here because he's so

311
00:34:51,829 --> 00:34:57,349
many places where you kind of hit your tugboat. It's almost frustrating. Yeah. You, you focus so

312
00:34:57,349 --> 00:35:03,269
much on the top here. I'm clearing out the top completely because you could have hit it there.

313
00:35:03,269 --> 00:35:09,690
And I'm going to be so sad. Like, look at this. Do you see a five and six? Yeah. If your tugboat

314
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:16,949
was there, I would lose my life going for the bottom. So I have to guess there. Is it possible

315
00:35:16,949 --> 00:35:21,820
to fill the whole board and not, what happened? Okay. What happens if you miss everything and

316
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:28,329
like this still boats on like spaces? Does every bolt just lose? Wait, there's no way to, it's not

317
00:35:28,329 --> 00:35:31,369
like you run out of bullets. Do you run out of bullets actually? I don't know. Do you run out

318
00:35:31,369 --> 00:35:39,340
of the bullets? No, I, I imagine not. That would be shocking. All right. Now I'm going for the five

319
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:44,900
strap. Cause I know you're destroyers out there. I'm just, I'm just looking for a place where there

320
00:35:44,900 --> 00:36:02,019
are two and I got it. Oh, no, no. Okay. Now I'm in trouble. I mean, do you mean I'm in trouble now?

321
00:36:02,019 --> 00:36:06,659
That's, that's my battle. Look how nicely it was tucked in. You painted around it. Yeah. That it

322
00:36:06,659 --> 00:36:10,980
was an actual, uh, like in a Looney Tunes cartoon where they fire the machine out of the person and

323
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:14,659
it just does like the lines around them. And then like the wall breaks behind them and they'd run

324
00:36:14,659 --> 00:36:19,860
away. Yeah. Yeah. It just falls behind them and there's just that, that faint outline,

325
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:24,260
but then you still shot Bugs Bunny at the end, which was fucked up for a children's cartoon.

326
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:28,710
Yeah. You somebody say I'm used to like shoot at people to like dance. Like then that's kind

327
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:39,110
of fucked up, isn't it? It is fucked up, but also in a way art. Yeah. What did he'd be like,

328
00:36:39,590 --> 00:36:45,800
well, wait, was it just an awful shot? No, I think it was like abusive. There was,

329
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:49,800
he was firing at them to like at their left, but why wouldn't he just shoot Bugs Bunny in the,

330
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:56,099
in the stomach? I don't understand. Why not simply murder Bugs Bunny? Because he was always like,

331
00:36:56,099 --> 00:36:59,380
like, all right, you're right. You're right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right.

332
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:04,019
Right. He would do that. And then he would fire like 400 rounds at him. Yeah. I don't know. Like

333
00:37:04,019 --> 00:37:13,659
missing almost all of them. I think he just fits the stereotype. Like the, like I get off my lawn.

334
00:37:13,659 --> 00:37:20,119
I'm down. I'm never going to find this. That was a family guy joke. Whatever. You get that

335
00:37:20,119 --> 00:37:24,139
problem. Family guy had good jokes. Oh, there it is. That's your destroyer. No, it's not.

336
00:37:25,019 --> 00:37:28,539
That's your destroyer. No, it's not. It's not even a destroyer. You're going too,

337
00:37:28,539 --> 00:37:39,219
it's too much. You're going to miss this last one. Heads I go right, tails I go left.

338
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:52,250
God damn it. The coin. God in his head. That was me. That was all me. Don't think

339
00:37:52,250 --> 00:38:03,690
German is even good. You're just really bad. Okay. Look, can you be bad at like throwing a

340
00:38:03,690 --> 00:38:08,170
handful of popcorn in the air and just like looking at the ground and picking up one or two

341
00:38:08,170 --> 00:38:14,550
random pieces? Can you be bad at that? Not really. I mean, let's be real. I did stack all of my ship

342
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:19,130
into the bottom left last round. I think that's a bad strat. Oh, I did the same thing though.

343
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:23,769
Yeah. But even you had the, the, you know, the redundancies of throwing a tugboat in the top

344
00:38:23,769 --> 00:38:27,690
right as a security measure. All right. All right. All right. Well, this is fine though,

345
00:38:27,690 --> 00:38:34,840
because what I'm doing is hustling you. Cause if I lose a couple, you start to get a little confident.

346
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:38,760
That's true. You could be just pulling the hustle on me and then I strike.

347
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:45,880
So where, where, what? That was one tier one sub and then one 10 subs,

348
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:53,429
one tier three sub 10 subs. You won $75. All right. How much did you go into the casino with?

349
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:59,179
What do you mean? Walked like last and Vegas. How much did you, how much did you go in with?

350
00:38:59,179 --> 00:39:02,940
I went in with $900. Okay. I'm going to try to get $900 from you.

351
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:11,909
Well, you're trying to fuck me like the casino did. Yeah. I'll give some back sometimes.

352
00:39:11,909 --> 00:39:15,510
You should think about me. We'll do another game where it's like, oh, this one's for $200.

353
00:39:16,389 --> 00:39:20,869
And you'll, I'll just lose on purpose and I'll just give you $200. And then you'll keep playing

354
00:39:20,869 --> 00:39:27,159
and I'll make it way harder. I have a really good strategy where if I lose like, let's say

355
00:39:27,159 --> 00:39:33,159
$500, I'll chase my losses and bet another 500 to win it back. And then if I lose that,

356
00:39:33,159 --> 00:39:41,300
I'll bet like a thousand to chase those losses and win that back. Um, wait, what is this? Hold on.

357
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:47,739
Alone in the dark. Is this like a, is this an alone in the dark game? What, what are you looking

358
00:39:47,739 --> 00:39:54,710
at? Is this named dev? Why don't I'm confused? Like in the, in the, is that, no, that's my way.

359
00:39:54,710 --> 00:39:58,760
Is that, it's my profile picture. I think. Are you looking at your own profile picture getting

360
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:02,760
confused? Yeah. I thought, I thought this was like an alone in the dark dev made this or something.

361
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:07,619
It was like an ad for alone in the dark. Now I understand that. I remember I made it alone

362
00:40:07,619 --> 00:40:11,139
in the dark because it's such like an unassuming profile picture. I used to hide when I played TF

363
00:40:11,139 --> 00:40:15,059
two. So people wouldn't know it was me. So I could just play a game and like hide and like make my

364
00:40:15,059 --> 00:40:18,739
name like fucking like vacuum cleaner and like make my profile picture, something just completely

365
00:40:18,739 --> 00:40:22,420
unassuming. So that's what that is. It's been that long since you've changed your profile picture?

366
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:26,539
Probably. Yeah. It's probably been like two or three years. That's insane. It's like, when you

367
00:40:26,539 --> 00:40:32,139
hold tab, it's like, I didn't have, oh, German, like German, NA five, the germ, the logo. Like

368
00:40:32,219 --> 00:40:36,139
I didn't do that. Like if you saw alone in the dark, you'd be like, oh, I don't fucking know

369
00:40:36,139 --> 00:40:39,900
anything about that guy. I don't care. Right. Cause then if someone saw a German, they might,

370
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:44,710
they might just chase you the whole time. Yeah. Cause I wouldn't, I wanted to like be able to play

371
00:40:44,710 --> 00:40:49,829
without having like any like, oh, there's like the guy, let's go get him or like, let's help him. I

372
00:40:49,829 --> 00:40:59,860
wanted to be like completely a natural environment. All right. That commander was not working out for

373
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:12,409
me. It's time to buy a new one. I'm going complete free to play. I'm purchasing Sir Philip Wade. Look

374
00:41:12,409 --> 00:41:17,300
at my ships. They're beautiful. Yeah. They actually, the art does change. That's true.

375
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:22,659
That's the only thing I'm paying. It's $3 every time I've spent $9 on changing the art of my

376
00:41:22,659 --> 00:41:26,900
ships. I think you just woke up like one of the devs of this game from like Hasbro because they

377
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:30,980
just got like a text on their phone because that probably happens so infrequently that they have a

378
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:35,130
tied to notifications on their, on their cell phone. They have, it's like a wolf blast. They

379
00:41:35,130 --> 00:41:39,769
get a text, an email, a Twitter notification. All right. So what do we, what do we got going

380
00:41:39,769 --> 00:41:44,170
here for this one? What's going on here? So look, we've, we've, we've escalated. You've,

381
00:41:44,170 --> 00:41:49,860
you've won, uh, two of the money ones. How about we, how about we remove the money for this one?

382
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:57,400
I have, I have a bit of a fun idea. Okay. The loser gets to buy a shirt for the winner that

383
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:05,019
they have to wear on stream camera on, of course. Okay. So wait, but I buy a t-shirt that you have

384
00:42:05,019 --> 00:42:12,619
to wear on stream. You buy a t-shirt and I'll wear it on stream. Yeah, exactly. Okay. All right.

385
00:42:13,099 --> 00:42:22,809
T-shirt the loser wants. Now I will say it must follow TOS. No, but yeah, it's, it's any t-shirt

386
00:42:22,809 --> 00:42:30,039
the loser wants. Oh, this is way more. This is way more than like $20. This is worth a lot more to

387
00:42:30,039 --> 00:42:35,239
me. This actually is more about, we could go back to money and save this one because we can do this

388
00:42:35,239 --> 00:42:49,449
at any point. No, I, I, I, I'm into it. Someone said to look at the battleship category.

389
00:42:51,099 --> 00:42:58,869
No, come on. What is this? What, what, what, what is it? Look at the battleship category.

390
00:42:58,869 --> 00:43:04,659
Look at the battleship category. Yeah. On Twitch. Look at the fucking battleship category on Twitch.

391
00:43:04,659 --> 00:43:10,219
All right. Hold on. I'm like a joke. I'm a slow boomer. It takes me a while.

392
00:43:10,219 --> 00:43:15,380
No, take your time. Take your time. I'm sure it'll stay there for a while. Okay. Back to Twitch.

393
00:43:16,820 --> 00:43:25,260
Battleship category. I'm so slow. You did this in two seconds. I'm like category dashboard.

394
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:34,340
Okay. Battleship. Where is it? Fuck. I'm too old for this. I didn't need help.

395
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:39,829
I'm going to link it to you. You just click open my link. They changed it. Did you? Oh, there we go.

396
00:43:39,829 --> 00:43:50,409
Browse. Okay. And then you just got to show it to your chat. Okay. Battleship. What the fuck is it?

397
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:57,719
I linked it to you on discord. You can click it. Oh, thank you, son. Appreciate it. No, no problem.

398
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:05,320
Respect. Oh, it's the directory. Right. Oh, thank you, son. Person losing. German one, Ludwig zero.

399
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:12,380
Person watching who's losing. Person who's watching. I want to screenshot this. Oh, it's

400
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:19,579
unnecessary to screenshot. This is amazing. This is terrible. No, this is incredible. It's slightly

401
00:44:19,579 --> 00:44:27,210
defamatory. I took a screenshot. I need that later. It's just my stupid face. And then someone who's

402
00:44:27,210 --> 00:44:32,539
pointing to me losing and then someone watching me losing. Oh, we do. Should we encourage this or not?

403
00:44:32,539 --> 00:44:37,820
I feel like we shouldn't because now someone said refresh. Oh, okay. Yeah. All right. Did it get

404
00:44:37,820 --> 00:44:42,460
worse? Yeah, it did get worse. It's person who's watching the person who's watching who's losing.

405
00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:50,119
Oh, my God. You guys, you are blowing up the Hasbro guy's phone. Another person went live

406
00:44:50,119 --> 00:44:54,199
playing Hasbro's battleship. Oh, my goodness. I can't wait to see what they're doing. We need to

407
00:44:54,199 --> 00:45:01,480
make a sequel to Battleship. All right. We'll let that be for a little while. Yeah, let that

408
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:08,179
fester and we'll come back to 18 people watching me lose. I need to win is what I'm noticing. I need

409
00:45:08,179 --> 00:45:13,769
to make a little bit of a comeback story. I can't look. I can't go on forever. I don't think I can

410
00:45:13,769 --> 00:45:26,619
win free in a row. You saying that is so stressful for me. Okay, I've gone one less ship. There's too

411
00:45:26,619 --> 00:45:39,019
many. I've gone for a stratagem. This might be stupid. This is so stupid. What a stupid thing

412
00:45:39,019 --> 00:45:47,369
I'm doing. Hold on. Let me see if this works. There we go. For people watching my chat like,

413
00:45:48,010 --> 00:46:00,300
I mean, all right. All right. I've I've developed the stratagem tails. Come on. First and get it

414
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:07,699
goes first has a huge advantage. Just inherently as if you land, then you want you pretty much can get

415
00:46:07,699 --> 00:46:22,460
one. You don't know what direction is though. You're from East Coast. Why did you do that?

416
00:46:22,460 --> 00:46:26,940
Why did you do that? I clicked wrong. I just actually misclicked. What the fuck?

417
00:46:28,860 --> 00:46:37,019
Wait, what did I just stumble upon? Jerma? What have you? The game is bugging for me.

418
00:46:37,019 --> 00:46:42,300
The game is the game bugging for you. Oh, yeah. Is it bugging? I specifically remember a phrase

419
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:48,840
that would watch what I'm doing here. Come on, give me that might have been the greatest

420
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:51,639
misclick of all time. All right. You went northbound on both of these then.

421
00:46:53,989 --> 00:47:03,460
Oh, that's huge. You went northbound. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Parallel. Look at this.

422
00:47:05,210 --> 00:47:14,889
That was a misclick of this entry. No, this is bad. This is bad. I don't know. I don't finish.

423
00:47:14,889 --> 00:47:18,809
Oh, you forgot about the ship. I think I see what you're doing. You're trying to see if I went that

424
00:47:18,809 --> 00:47:34,679
way. They did the same thing. I'm not that much of an idiot. I just don't buy the mega milk shirt.

425
00:47:34,679 --> 00:47:39,719
That just that's my one request. Don't say that one more time. Don't buy the mega milk shirt.

426
00:47:39,719 --> 00:47:44,199
That's like my one request. Just don't do that for you. When I win this,

427
00:47:44,199 --> 00:47:49,369
don't buy you the mega milk shirt. Yes. So please don't do that. Could you tell me why

428
00:47:49,369 --> 00:47:53,050
I should show you mercy here? Well, first of all, you got to win. Oh my what?

429
00:47:53,050 --> 00:48:01,050
You're looking at my screen. You're cheating. I want to win this one. Everyone gets one cheat.

430
00:48:01,050 --> 00:48:05,289
Come on. It's Twitch. You know, you're allowed to cheat on one game show on one on one battleship

431
00:48:05,289 --> 00:48:12,019
game. Oh, no. But the thing is, though, I have something very hidden. He's not going to understand

432
00:48:12,019 --> 00:48:20,489
where it is. Okay. You know, be wicked funny if you got me in the t shirt for the band that I

433
00:48:20,489 --> 00:48:25,110
fucking hate more than anything. What is that? I don't know. I don't think I want to tell you

434
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:30,070
because if you buy it, then it's really embarrassing. I have a like it almost feels

435
00:48:30,070 --> 00:48:34,230
the way you're posturing. This is that you like you love this band. No, I have a thing with my

436
00:48:34,230 --> 00:48:38,150
chat where we talk a ton of shit about the gorillas. Like I just hate them. They're like the worst

437
00:48:38,150 --> 00:48:42,389
really in the history. Yeah. It's just like me going. I would hate if you got me a signed Tom

438
00:48:42,389 --> 00:48:48,630
Brady jersey like that would suck so much. Please don't do that. Where are your ships? They don't

439
00:48:48,630 --> 00:48:56,059
exist. You're doing the the old the old rabbit you're shooting around. Yeah, I really am. I

440
00:48:56,059 --> 00:49:10,820
have no rhyme or reason to this. Oh, I think you put a ship in G3. You don't think about the

441
00:49:10,820 --> 00:49:18,619
letters of the numbers, do you? No, I just my brain just goes fired there. There's no point.

442
00:49:18,619 --> 00:49:22,809
I don't think the numbers mean much. No, you're probably right. I think I'm putting too much

443
00:49:22,809 --> 00:49:30,730
weight into them. So what is this mega milk shirt? I'm going to look this up right now.

444
00:49:30,730 --> 00:49:34,809
Don't don't don't look it up. No, I'm serious. I'm actually serious. Like you probably shouldn't

445
00:49:34,809 --> 00:49:40,010
look it up on stream. That's I would look it up off stream. Well, no, don't. No, no, no, no, no.

446
00:49:40,010 --> 00:49:43,849
Don't look it up off stream either. Don't even look. There's no reason to look it. What the

447
00:49:43,849 --> 00:49:48,730
hell is this? It's not like, oh, hey, off stream. Go look at this. No, people are freaking out.

448
00:49:48,730 --> 00:49:52,010
It's it's just it's like I don't know. I don't know. I can't even explain it. Just

449
00:49:52,010 --> 00:49:56,650
don't look it up ever. OK, I looked it up on Amazon and what I saw was this shirt that said

450
00:49:56,650 --> 00:50:03,050
mega milk. They're very tame. But then one of the shirts has an anime character. Yeah, don't look

451
00:50:03,050 --> 00:50:08,010
it up. Really? OK, yeah. Yeah, I'm sorry. Be careful. You're not talking about that, right?

452
00:50:08,010 --> 00:50:12,280
Like, obviously, that's not related. It's just a separate. No, somebody like that. Yeah,

453
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:16,519
that's unrelated. And it's not. Yeah, that's a bet. It's not even worth looking at. OK,

454
00:50:16,519 --> 00:50:23,159
yeah, it's not even worth looking up. That makes sense. I wore that shirt, by the way.

455
00:50:24,119 --> 00:50:36,230
The on stream. No, no, I have this shirt that's like a blue, like a Toronto Blue Jays

456
00:50:36,230 --> 00:50:41,989
S baseball tee. It's the blue sleeves and the white on the front. And every time I wear it,

457
00:50:41,989 --> 00:50:46,070
people say I'm wearing the mega milk shirt. And I'm just like, leave me alone. I like this shirt.

458
00:50:46,070 --> 00:50:52,789
I like the colors. Who is Blue Jays S like the same color? Yeah, it's like it's like that blue

459
00:50:52,789 --> 00:50:58,150
and white baseball. It's just a color. OK, all right. Yeah, I see that. So like the sleeves

460
00:50:58,150 --> 00:51:04,230
are different color from the body and it looks like the mega milk shirt just without the text

461
00:51:04,230 --> 00:51:08,070
on it. The more you talk about this, I have to tell you, the funnier it is, the more I want to

462
00:51:08,070 --> 00:51:19,380
do this. Would I get suspended if I wore the mega milk shirt? Oh, I mean, look, Twitch is I am I

463
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:23,059
don't know which one you're talking about. You'd have to link it to me for me to know because I've

464
00:51:23,059 --> 00:51:32,099
worn a slew of bad things slew. It's it's numerous because I do an Amazon stream. I let chat buy

465
00:51:32,099 --> 00:51:37,420
anything and I'll wear it. So, you know, I've worn shirts that say like come in me. I'm here for the

466
00:51:37,420 --> 00:51:48,179
bukkake. I have a set of keycaps that are just gatchy keycaps, just abhorrent things. I have a

467
00:51:48,179 --> 00:51:58,119
six hundred dollar statue of Nami from one piece. OK, the first one has got you got you got me a

468
00:51:58,119 --> 00:52:05,349
little twisted on that one that you wore that on stream. The come in me shirt. Yeah. Oh, yeah. I

469
00:52:05,349 --> 00:52:13,190
wore that. I wore that out. I were away. We wear this frequently. I wore it like because I don't

470
00:52:13,190 --> 00:52:19,659
leave my house often. So I wore it like, you know, a pretty good amount in my home because I thought

471
00:52:19,659 --> 00:52:25,820
it was funny. But unlike, you know, without thinking much, I went to Vegas one time and I was

472
00:52:25,820 --> 00:52:32,340
wearing that and I and I didn't realize until someone pointed at my shirt and went that that's

473
00:52:32,340 --> 00:52:37,699
insane. It's just like, oh, shit. And I was like, oh, shit. And I put it inside out. I was embarrassed.

474
00:52:37,699 --> 00:52:43,880
And so it said Mucknee M for the rest of the day. That's the kind of shirt you have to make sure

475
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:48,599
is not available if you have to do laundry or something like it's the only shirt left. Yeah.

476
00:52:48,679 --> 00:52:57,559
Yeah. Finally, I fucking land on you. I do feel in a in a great spot right now because I only have

477
00:52:57,559 --> 00:53:04,090
your destroyer, which is a five X ship. Yeah. It can only be in so many locations. I'm in trouble.

478
00:53:04,090 --> 00:53:29,480
Let's see. This should be it. Oh, I get to live another day. What? Oh, you're up. Once you see my

479
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:34,619
strategy, it's going to change the battleship meta. You think so? I genuinely think so. I went

480
00:53:34,619 --> 00:53:39,860
for a Jack and the Beanstalk method. Wait, does that mean that you went just in a straight line

481
00:53:39,860 --> 00:53:52,170
the whole way? No, no, no, no. Although that's a great strategy, I'm sure. And I almost get the

482
00:53:52,170 --> 00:53:56,019
feeling that you're throwing on purpose because you want to wear this mega milk shirt. I want to.

483
00:53:56,019 --> 00:53:59,880
I don't even know why you would have bought something like I have no idea why I said that.

484
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:03,480
Yeah, I would have never. There's no universe where I would have gotten. You know what? I'm

485
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:09,820
going to get you a mega milk shirt. It's a you brought it up like, oh, please don't do this to

486
00:54:09,820 --> 00:54:16,869
me. I don't know why I get the feeling you know, maybe party wants to try it. Oh, no,

487
00:54:16,869 --> 00:54:22,340
I might not get the opportunity. But I don't know what kind of shirt would I get you if I absolutely

488
00:54:22,340 --> 00:54:28,380
probably know I'm not going to win. Let's let's not worry about that. I still I only need one.

489
00:54:28,380 --> 00:54:36,409
You only need one. But if you happen to get it, OK, you're covering my Jack and the Beanstalk.

490
00:54:36,969 --> 00:54:51,239
I am whiffing a lot, though. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. On a five ship. Oh, come on. Painting around it.

491
00:54:52,360 --> 00:55:07,989
OK, it's a five X. It can be here. It can be up here. All right. There's a two,

492
00:55:08,630 --> 00:55:16,139
a two and a four and a three and three. I'll give you a hint. I'll make it spicy.

493
00:55:16,139 --> 00:55:19,880
What? It's not. You said Jack and the Beanstalk. That would be straight up.

494
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:27,269
I'll give you a hint right now. You might need to refresh your browser on Twitter,

495
00:55:27,269 --> 00:55:30,070
like the channel. I'm watching your channel right now that you refresh your channel.

496
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:40,179
It's F5. It's a it's like a technical joke. You're right here. No, you're not.

497
00:55:41,619 --> 00:55:46,760
Joe, I told you were. Oh, you were telling me where you were.

498
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:52,280
I was telling you. Oh, it's F5. I thought you were doing like a hit F5.

499
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:54,440
You're watching my stream. I know you're cheating. Ha ha.

500
00:55:56,460 --> 00:56:01,579
No, I was trying to give you information. Oh, but I think that was the only place

501
00:56:01,579 --> 00:56:07,940
it could have been there. Well, congratulations. I feel good. I don't know if you threw that on

502
00:56:07,940 --> 00:56:15,639
purpose, but my strategy was pretty impeccable. No, I thought you were going up up. Well,

503
00:56:15,639 --> 00:56:19,239
we don't know if he's going to buy the Mega Milk shirt or not. You know what I mean? Nobody knows

504
00:56:19,239 --> 00:56:25,320
that he could find a favor might have something really funnier to do. If you could just link me

505
00:56:25,320 --> 00:56:33,340
the Mega Milk shirt you're referencing, what happens if I look up Mega Milk Jerma? Oh,

506
00:56:33,340 --> 00:56:37,179
I do not think you should do that. And I'm serious about that one. I'm dead serious.

507
00:56:37,179 --> 00:56:41,670
I don't know if you should write that. This is fine. It's just that the text can't be there's

508
00:56:41,670 --> 00:56:45,909
nothing wrong with the text, right? Does Mega Milk mean something I'm unaware of? I don't know. I

509
00:56:45,909 --> 00:56:51,610
don't know what it means. I just know it's something that's like TOS. Look up Mega Milk on a wiki.

510
00:56:51,610 --> 00:56:56,730
That's a website I can't pull up. I don't know. I just know that it's like a thing. It's like a,

511
00:56:57,289 --> 00:57:02,250
I got some kind of potentially sexual thing. I don't know. Okay. I'm looking this up. You

512
00:57:02,250 --> 00:57:08,469
said the shirt you like it, but you're you're just wearing it here. I mean, in broad daylight,

513
00:57:08,469 --> 00:57:11,829
you are wearing. No, that's somebody photoshopped that. That's not real. No,

514
00:57:12,820 --> 00:57:19,380
how would they Photoshop with the lanyard? No, I know that image. Yeah. No, that's a Photoshop

515
00:57:19,380 --> 00:57:23,059
shirt that they like. You're telling me that's not real. It's not real. No, I didn't wear it in

516
00:57:23,059 --> 00:57:29,719
public. I don't know if I buy that. It seems like an innocent enough shirt. It's just look,

517
00:57:29,719 --> 00:57:35,719
how about this? You'll just you'll think of something really funny to make me wear. And it's

518
00:57:35,719 --> 00:57:40,489
definitely not going to be that one. All right. All right. I'm going to just link you an option

519
00:57:41,130 --> 00:57:47,019
and you just look at it. And then I want you to react to it and tell me what you think. Okay. So

520
00:57:47,019 --> 00:57:55,000
I did you give it to me as an image, by the way, because I'm so stupid. I don't, I don't,

521
00:57:55,000 --> 00:58:01,000
I don't want to wear that. You're not a fan of this one. Okay. This is like, I don't, I,

522
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:04,360
can I even wear this? How did you, how did you not get in trouble for this?

523
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:14,710
Wearing your shirt that says, come in me. Hold on. I have to show it.

524
00:58:14,710 --> 00:58:31,820
JPG. What is this? Why is this saved? Can I show this? I don't want to show this. I have to wear

525
00:58:31,820 --> 00:58:37,909
this. This is what you're deciding on. Okay. We saw it. I don't want that on this camera.

526
00:58:37,909 --> 00:58:50,900
Oh, I just muted and deafened at the same time. Sorry. You've been deafened for like probably

527
00:58:50,900 --> 00:58:55,340
two minutes. I'm sorry. I hit the wrong button. That's all right. Are we going to have more of

528
00:58:55,340 --> 00:59:11,800
these? Okay. I'm just sending you a few shirts that I think this one's pretty good too. You look

529
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:19,050
soft. Are you showing your chat yet? Yeah. Each one that comes in, they're getting, they're getting

530
00:59:19,050 --> 00:59:26,340
a view of it. All right. All right. This is one I wore, uh, quite a lot actually. My, my girlfriend

531
00:59:26,340 --> 00:59:33,659
took it. She, she likes wearing it now because it's a pretty comfy shirt, but, but affirmed,

532
00:59:33,659 --> 00:59:40,820
they have been worn on stream. Oh my God. You said your girlfriend, you said your girlfriend,

533
00:59:40,820 --> 00:59:50,820
where's this now? Regularly. I mean, all right. People are going to screen cap this. I have to

534
00:59:50,820 --> 01:00:05,380
go like, no, no, no, I am. That's not me. No. Yeah. You have to have your, uh, uh, what about

535
01:00:05,380 --> 01:00:10,570
this one? I do not look forward to wearing these. Okay. What do you got? What do you got for me?

536
01:00:19,019 --> 01:00:27,699
What's the one? All right. And this is, this is one that I think is great. Which one? Here's

537
01:00:27,699 --> 01:00:38,679
the final one I have. All right. There it is. This is a fun one. Hold on. I'm saving them.

538
01:00:39,159 --> 01:00:55,179
Oh, I am. I'm a hundred percent American, 75% Irish, 60% water, 50 cents, biggest fan, 40 pounds

539
01:00:55,179 --> 01:00:59,099
overweight, seven years from retirement and five minutes from having to shit at this lows.

540
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:11,750
This shirt sucks. Yeah, it does suck. This looks like an old like webpage from 1995.

541
01:01:12,789 --> 01:01:18,329
Yeah. Yeah. It'd be like the, like the banner for like some shitty ass, you know,

542
01:01:18,889 --> 01:01:27,739
blog form or whatever. What is this one? So this, this is what you've narrowed it down to.

543
01:01:28,679 --> 01:01:35,260
Oh, I mean, I'll, I'll mull over a bit. Uh, you know, maybe chat can inspire me some more.

544
01:01:35,260 --> 01:01:38,780
A lot of people want you to have this one. I'll, I'll send it to you, but I, I wouldn't do this to

545
01:01:38,780 --> 01:01:45,030
you. Cause I think this one's abhorrent. I think just even owning this is a bit of an atrocity.

546
01:01:45,030 --> 01:01:50,630
What am I owning? If you like owned this, cause you'd wear it. Obviously you'd have to, I don't

547
01:01:50,630 --> 01:01:55,750
want that one. I don't want this one. I know. That's why I'm saying I don't want, I don't want

548
01:01:55,750 --> 01:02:01,429
this one. No, I know. Please spare me. Please spare me. I'll wear the cum shirt. I'll wear the

549
01:02:01,429 --> 01:02:10,250
cum shirt. Okay. I'm serious. I'm not wearing this one. Where is it? I, I, I, no, no, no. Okay. All

550
01:02:10,250 --> 01:02:16,179
right. I'll know. I would, anyone, but this one, if chat was to decide, that's what they would do.

551
01:02:16,179 --> 01:02:20,920
They would put that one on your body, but I wouldn't do that to you. Cause I understand there's,

552
01:02:20,920 --> 01:02:31,769
you know, there's lines, but I'll, I'll mull it over. I'll have to look at this mega milk a bit

553
01:02:31,769 --> 01:02:37,610
more. I got, I got, I got $70 and you got to humiliate me in front of everybody. Yeah. It does

554
01:02:37,610 --> 01:02:43,610
seem a bit imbalanced. Doesn't it? What's a monetary equivalent to how much you wear that

555
01:02:43,610 --> 01:02:50,539
shirt on stream for 70 bucks. I've worn that shirt for free. I paid for it. Yeah. You've worn the

556
01:02:50,539 --> 01:02:56,619
pizza, pizza one with the, yeah. So I do an Amazon stream and I, and I let them buy anything

557
01:02:56,619 --> 01:03:02,059
and I only get three vetoes. So I could veto that shirt or I could veto like a $10,000 engagement

558
01:03:02,059 --> 01:03:13,030
ring. So I, you know, I have to pick my battles. Hold on people. That's so funny, dude. They just

559
01:03:13,030 --> 01:03:18,489
link whatever they want. And let me tell you that you buy cars on Amazon. You can, yes you can. You

560
01:03:18,489 --> 01:03:27,219
can buy a Chevy, a Ford. That's so funny, dude. All right. That's amazing. The category of

561
01:03:27,219 --> 01:03:34,340
battleship has blown up. Checking the battleship category. Let's see it. Oh, it's, it's, it's gone

562
01:03:34,340 --> 01:03:39,619
off the deep end. It's there's, there's just someone with a mega milk shirt. You want to play

563
01:03:39,619 --> 01:03:45,429
among us. These people, you're all going to get banned. You remember Bukaki 4k webcam.

564
01:03:45,909 --> 01:03:53,909
You guys are all going to get your like channels banned. Look at this guy. It's a big Jerma

565
01:03:53,909 --> 01:04:03,590
supporter. Go Jerma go. This dog's pretty cute. One of these guys has like a hundred viewers.

566
01:04:05,079 --> 01:04:11,369
Yeah. The losing 50, 50. Yeah. The person playing among us says it's doing, doing well actually.

567
01:04:11,369 --> 01:04:16,900
Yeah. They're, I think they're just playing among us. This one's just trying to get you to add an

568
01:04:16,900 --> 01:04:27,780
emote. Jerma Sag. This person is jerking off on stream. Can you define zirking for me? It's from

569
01:04:27,780 --> 01:04:31,860
that streamer simulator game where everything, everything had a Z replaced at the front of the

570
01:04:31,860 --> 01:04:39,699
word. Right. That is a good game. It is pretty good. This is an auto emote. I can't keep track.

571
01:04:39,699 --> 01:04:47,539
Chicken McNugget. I'm looking at you kissing, uh, Chuck E. Cheese. Did you ever hear the story of

572
01:04:47,539 --> 01:04:52,940
that? Of you kissing Chuck E. Cheese? Yeah. Oh yeah. I'm not familiar with that. No. Chuck E.

573
01:04:52,940 --> 01:04:59,449
Cheese raided the channel like last year. Oh, like the corporation. Like actually like Chuck E.

574
01:04:59,449 --> 01:05:03,929
Cheese was streaming Fall Guys or something and he like raided a host of the channel and somebody

575
01:05:03,929 --> 01:05:07,530
said, put this on stream. And I said, what is it? And I, and I, I didn't like really want to put it

576
01:05:07,530 --> 01:05:10,409
on stream, but like, I just did it anyways. And like, I think I, I think I fucked up and put it

577
01:05:10,409 --> 01:05:16,980
on twice. Um, it was me kissing Chuck E. Cheese, like on the lips and they had already had it made.

578
01:05:16,980 --> 01:05:20,340
It was already, it was already ready. They had me kissing Chuck E. Cheese. But the funniest part

579
01:05:20,340 --> 01:05:26,409
about it is the Chuck E. Cheese stock price tanked when the image showed up on stream.

580
01:05:26,409 --> 01:05:32,599
Like actually like in real, like actually the real stock went down. Like when Cristiano Ronaldo said,

581
01:05:32,599 --> 01:05:36,280
I don't drink Coke and the stock plummeted, you have the same effect on Chuck E. Cheese.

582
01:05:36,280 --> 01:05:40,599
But like, I don't think that's what happened. I think they had like some kind of announcement

583
01:05:40,599 --> 01:05:45,000
or some kind of news or somebody like sold for some reason. And like, it just happened to line

584
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:52,199
up to like the 10 minute window of me showing it on stream. I like to imagine the largest Chuck E.

585
01:05:52,199 --> 01:05:58,679
Cheese shareholder just watches you, you know, for entertainment and then happened to see that

586
01:05:58,679 --> 01:06:04,340
and thought, you know what, it's, it's time to pull out. It's time. I don't think it was related

587
01:06:04,340 --> 01:06:10,949
at all though. It was like just some weird, hilarious coincidence. I think what is this?

588
01:06:10,949 --> 01:06:15,880
So what, all right. So what are the stakes of the next one? If we're going to keep upping the stakes

589
01:06:15,880 --> 01:06:20,570
here and then now what, how do we go from, how do we, how do we add to, to the stakes?

590
01:06:22,460 --> 01:06:27,739
How do we add to the stakes? So look, we, we flipped off money. We can, we can go back to money.

591
01:06:29,190 --> 01:06:33,860
You want to go, you want to go back to cash? We could do like, uh, I think it's time.

592
01:06:33,860 --> 01:06:41,530
We could do the a hundred gifted match. Okay. Cause I think the, if we're escalating shirts,

593
01:06:41,530 --> 01:06:48,980
that then it goes outfits. Then, then one of us is going to become a cat made for a day.

594
01:06:48,980 --> 01:06:57,670
Have you worn a cat girl costume before? No, I haven't. You haven't?

595
01:07:00,230 --> 01:07:06,280
Bugleberry, right? That's, that's my answer. If I looked up for instance, like cat boy,

596
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:14,949
you would find plenty of material. That's for sure. That is a lot of it. That's more fan art

597
01:07:14,949 --> 01:07:20,019
than times you've worn it. Surely. Oh yeah. Probably by a hundred times. That's crazy.

598
01:07:20,019 --> 01:07:28,300
Fan fiction goes a long way. Uh, are you, are you getting the rematch? Oh yeah. Sorry. I, uh,

599
01:07:29,340 --> 01:07:35,099
Oh, there he is clubbing, but I'm happy to do a 100 gifted match. You want to do a hundred gifted

600
01:07:35,099 --> 01:07:39,860
subs? I think that's a, that's a strategy. All right. All right. A hundred gifted subs. Let's do

601
01:07:39,860 --> 01:07:47,420
it. Okay. Sir Philip Wade. He's never lost. This is really important. This is, this is for a lot

602
01:07:47,420 --> 01:08:25,130
of money. Do this. I'm ready. I'm not ready. I'm not ready. Hold on. This is a bad strat.

603
01:08:25,770 --> 01:08:46,380
Is that good everybody? That's weird, right? That's like a weird one that he won't ever figure it

604
01:08:46,380 --> 01:09:00,970
out. No, you're throwing. No, I'm not. I don't think he's going to get this. I think this is

605
01:09:00,970 --> 01:09:18,229
the winner right here. I really do. That's the winner. God. Are you happy with yours?

606
01:09:18,229 --> 01:09:25,340
I am as happy as I think I could be. I think my chap bullied me out of my strategy, which was a

607
01:09:25,340 --> 01:09:30,699
straight line up the middle. I, you probably would have won. That was a mistake. I I'm, I'm kind of

608
01:09:30,699 --> 01:09:35,579
like a frog brain. I probably wouldn't have done it. Uh, I think you've gone back to being a corner

609
01:09:35,579 --> 01:09:47,659
Karen. See what if you went, what if you did this though? What if you went right in the middle?

610
01:09:51,539 --> 01:09:54,739
If you get this, okay. All right. Save. All right. I got this. I know where you are

611
01:09:55,960 --> 01:10:11,510
living another day. I have a fine amount of time before you hit. I gotta make this count. Oh no.

612
01:10:11,510 --> 01:10:18,149
Oh God. All right. All right. So here's your destroyer right here. Oh no, you went down. Yep.

613
01:10:18,149 --> 01:10:31,289
Yep. I think, I think you try. I think you're avoiding all the edges. Corner Karen is this a

614
01:10:31,289 --> 01:10:35,609
waste of my time. I feel like I'm wasting this. You're not a corner. Karen, maybe you avoid it.

615
01:10:35,609 --> 01:10:39,529
Not in those corners, not in those corners. Oh, you're trying to get me to click the last

616
01:10:39,529 --> 01:10:43,770
corner, but I'm, I'm too smart. I'm never going to click the last corner. Well, then I guess

617
01:10:43,770 --> 01:10:54,170
you're never going to win the game. You've swayed me. You're a villain. What if I told you something

618
01:10:54,170 --> 01:11:02,140
was right next to my destroyer? It probably is. I'll get there eventually. Don't worry. I'm just,

619
01:11:02,140 --> 01:11:12,460
I'm just saying what if I told you not that I'm not telling you that. Okay. Oh, all right. All

620
01:11:12,460 --> 01:11:19,539
right. But I mean, it could be anywhere. It would have been so bad ass if I had hit another ship.

621
01:11:19,539 --> 01:11:24,500
Oh, you're just trying to be like, throw the, throw the ball behind your back and swish. Yeah.

622
01:11:24,500 --> 01:11:30,739
I wanted to try to, that's, that was someone who has never seen basketball before. Try to explain

623
01:11:30,739 --> 01:11:37,500
that. What? You said throw the ball behind the back and swish. It sounded like you'd never seen

624
01:11:37,500 --> 01:11:42,380
the sport of basketball before. Oh no. I'm talking about like you, you like turn around and like face

625
01:11:42,380 --> 01:11:47,180
away from the hoop and just throw it backwards and try and get a swish. Oh yeah. Just behind the

626
01:11:47,180 --> 01:11:51,689
back. Yeah. Yeah. And absolute. It was a, it was a YOLO attempt. Oh, you thought I meant like,

627
01:11:51,689 --> 01:11:55,210
oh yeah, the guy that like throws the ball around it back and goes into the hoop, that thing.

628
01:11:55,210 --> 01:12:01,829
Like an announcer's first day on the job. Oh shit. Oh, all right. All right. I'll make a wager with

629
01:12:01,829 --> 01:12:06,729
you. Oh wait, right now? No, no, no, no. I was going to say if you got the right direction,

630
01:12:06,729 --> 01:12:13,130
I'd give you five subs. Oh shit. You, you got it. You got it. I feel good about that. I think,

631
01:12:13,850 --> 01:12:19,239
if you land this next one right here, that just this next hit, it just has to be the next hit.

632
01:12:19,239 --> 01:12:29,029
I'll wear the mega milk shirt tomorrow. Oh my God. Oh my God. I have a feeling your strategy

633
01:12:29,590 --> 01:12:37,399
was having your ships go from the edge towards the center. So only one piece of it touches the edge.

634
01:12:37,399 --> 01:12:45,079
I don't, I don't know. I don't think so right now by like my heart is like, oh, like kind of,

635
01:12:46,039 --> 01:12:53,239
this is a bit stressful. Well, cause I, well, I didn't want to wear the mega milk shirt tomorrow.

636
01:12:53,239 --> 01:12:57,079
Yeah. That would have been bad for you. It would have been. Oh, okay. Okay. Here, here, here.

637
01:12:57,079 --> 01:13:01,560
All right. I will wager you five gifted. You don't know which direction I'm going here.

638
01:13:01,560 --> 01:13:08,550
So if I hit, it's wrong. That's right. But if you miss, thank you. I'll get that. Yeah. I'll

639
01:13:08,550 --> 01:13:16,600
get that right away. I do have to open your stream to give that though. Why don't we keep a tally so

640
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:20,979
that we can just remember later? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Cause it is kind of like a, you have to like

641
01:13:21,460 --> 01:13:25,619
this and then you're going to accept and then process and then I was saying, cause I would

642
01:13:25,619 --> 01:13:34,520
see where you are. Oh, right. Yeah. Hey, don't do that. Hey, don't do that. Oh no. Are you

643
01:13:34,520 --> 01:13:41,699
shitting me? Oh no. And it's right here. Are you shitting me? Oh no. You're in a lot of trouble.

644
01:13:41,699 --> 01:13:47,909
I am in a lot of trouble. I think you've discovered my stratagem. Oh, you get another

645
01:13:47,909 --> 01:13:52,949
one here. If you get at one right here, you're doing, you're doing like the, like the everybody's

646
01:13:52,949 --> 01:13:59,930
facing in. No, no. I found you out. I was doing, it was a cross is, you know, like a,

647
01:13:59,930 --> 01:14:07,579
like a Christian cross. Well, it's you're in a lot of trouble now. Well, you'll never get my two

648
01:14:07,579 --> 01:14:17,220
boat. Imagine it's just in the center, linking everything that you were drawing. Uh, okay.

649
01:14:17,220 --> 01:14:26,250
There we go. Oh, left, right. I'm actually, but oh no, maybe it's a tugboat going down.

650
01:14:26,250 --> 01:14:30,329
So this, this might take me a while because it's just your two boat. That's the only thing.

651
01:14:30,729 --> 01:14:35,880
It's just my two boat and it should realistically take you about 10 shots

652
01:14:35,880 --> 01:14:49,829
to get here. Realistically. But it's too bad that it's right here. It's too bad that it's right

653
01:14:49,829 --> 01:14:56,420
here. I thought you were going to do a thing where it's like up. That was a dangerous shot.

654
01:14:56,420 --> 01:15:01,750
Oh, cause now you've left the corner open. Can you do it? Can you do it? Can you do it?

655
01:15:01,750 --> 01:15:08,300
Toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat. Toy boat,

656
01:15:08,300 --> 01:15:12,550
toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat. That's another time gift it's up.

657
01:15:12,550 --> 01:15:15,770
You practice you're embarrassing me now. I

658
01:15:16,529 --> 01:15:24,350
Have actually have I do that all the time. They have a lot of practice that was actually really good for a first-timer

659
01:15:24,350 --> 01:15:25,890
I'll tell you

660
01:15:25,890 --> 01:15:30,770
Yeah, you guys are like meet meetings you do meetups. Oh some people people can't even get past the second one

661
01:15:30,770 --> 01:15:35,909
That was pretty good. That really was I'm serious. I appreciate that. I used to do when I was younger

662
01:15:36,149 --> 01:15:39,220
There's some French tongue twisters. You could try

663
01:15:40,899 --> 01:15:48,220
It's so it's um the the English translations if your uncle shaves your uncle

664
01:15:48,460 --> 01:15:52,859
Uncle be shaved but in French it sounds like it's very literal

665
01:15:53,840 --> 01:16:07,359
The French one is sit on m

666
01:16:07,359 --> 01:16:10,510
Oh, say it again. Yeah, I want to hear that again.

667
01:16:11,510 --> 01:16:12,489
On your pizzeria.

668
01:16:20,359 --> 01:16:21,260
Say it again?

669
01:16:22,140 --> 01:16:22,939
It's, so it's

670
01:16:23,619 --> 01:16:24,600
that's yours.

671
01:16:25,800 --> 01:16:26,760
That's how you say uncle.

672
01:16:28,100 --> 01:16:29,479
Tom, which is shave

673
01:16:30,489 --> 01:16:30,970
Tongue your

674
01:16:31,449 --> 01:16:32,529
Tom Tom

675
01:16:36,039 --> 01:16:36,819
will be shaved.

676
01:16:36,819 --> 01:16:40,119
I feel like the Charlie Brown parents talking...

677
01:16:44,199 --> 01:16:45,689
...don't you.

678
01:16:45,689 --> 01:16:47,689
We are now just the adults.

679
01:16:47,689 --> 01:16:50,699
We can't communicate with the children anymore.

680
01:16:50,699 --> 01:16:55,069
Uhhh...

681
01:16:55,069 --> 01:16:57,430
Did you still have a destroyer somewhere?

682
01:16:57,430 --> 01:16:58,819
There we go.

683
01:16:58,819 --> 01:16:59,819
That wasn't a Family Guy joke.

684
01:16:59,819 --> 01:17:00,420
That was literally...

685
01:17:00,420 --> 01:17:03,699
He just said a thing in French.

686
01:17:03,699 --> 01:17:05,199
They're calling my joke a Family Guy joke?

687
01:17:05,199 --> 01:17:06,199
It just said Family Guy joke.

688
01:17:06,199 --> 01:17:06,699
I know.

689
01:17:06,699 --> 01:17:07,699
It's unbelievable.

690
01:17:07,699 --> 01:17:08,779
I can't believe them.

691
01:17:08,779 --> 01:17:09,680
Every...

692
01:17:09,680 --> 01:17:12,380
Everything we try to do on this platform,

693
01:17:12,380 --> 01:17:15,479
Peter fucking Griffin is already done.

694
01:17:15,479 --> 01:17:16,880
I can't believe he's not in Fortnite.

695
01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:18,979
I was so sad when he didn't get in.

696
01:17:18,979 --> 01:17:20,739
Oh, you got him.

697
01:17:20,739 --> 01:17:22,039
Wait, that's huge for me.

698
01:17:22,039 --> 01:17:22,539
That actually...

699
01:17:22,539 --> 01:17:23,579
That's very big.

700
01:17:23,680 --> 01:17:28,789
This could be a comeback of epic proportions.

701
01:17:28,789 --> 01:17:31,479
I'm actually kind of nervous because,

702
01:17:31,479 --> 01:17:32,180
like you said,

703
01:17:32,180 --> 01:17:35,079
I have to find just your little two guy.

704
01:17:35,079 --> 01:17:35,380
Yeah.

705
01:17:35,380 --> 01:17:38,220
And that could be anywhere.

706
01:17:38,220 --> 01:17:42,520
I...

707
01:17:42,520 --> 01:17:45,920
I do think you have a strategy that might be in my favor here.

708
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:52,060
Oh, it could be anywhere.

709
01:17:52,060 --> 01:17:56,550
It's gonna take me forever to find this.

710
01:17:56,550 --> 01:17:59,479
Alright, I just have to...

711
01:17:59,479 --> 01:18:00,680
I have to rein it in.

712
01:18:00,680 --> 01:18:04,739
Just focus.

713
01:18:04,739 --> 01:18:10,380
It's gonna be, like, in a weird place, like...

714
01:18:10,380 --> 01:18:24,479
I'm trying to clear every 5x area.

715
01:18:24,579 --> 01:18:27,079
Why is everybody saying Aaron?

716
01:18:27,079 --> 01:18:27,479
I'm not gonna do that.

717
01:18:27,479 --> 01:18:28,079
Aaron?

718
01:18:28,079 --> 01:18:28,979
No, I'm not gonna...

719
01:18:28,979 --> 01:18:30,880
I'm not gonna embarrass myself in front of Ludwig.

720
01:18:30,880 --> 01:18:31,659
No.

721
01:18:31,659 --> 01:18:33,460
Wait, what's Aaron?

722
01:18:33,460 --> 01:18:33,960
It's just...

723
01:18:33,960 --> 01:18:37,510
It's this thing that people like that I say.

724
01:18:37,510 --> 01:18:38,210
Do what?

725
01:18:38,210 --> 01:18:38,810
Say it.

726
01:18:38,810 --> 01:18:41,479
Okay, have you ever watched Attack on Titan?

727
01:18:41,479 --> 01:18:42,079
Yeah, of course.

728
01:18:42,079 --> 01:18:42,880
Okay, have you watched...

729
01:18:42,880 --> 01:18:45,500
The dub of Attack on Titan or the sub?

730
01:18:45,500 --> 01:18:48,800
I think I've watched both, but mostly the sub.

731
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:50,500
But I think my first season was dubbed.

732
01:18:50,500 --> 01:18:54,680
So you've seen, like, the dubbed actors in the show?

733
01:18:54,680 --> 01:18:55,380
Yes, yeah.

734
01:18:55,380 --> 01:18:57,180
So if I were to go like this...

735
01:18:57,180 --> 01:18:59,680
Aaron! Aaron! Aaron!

736
01:18:59,680 --> 01:19:00,279
You would know what that was?

737
01:19:00,279 --> 01:19:00,779
Yeah.

738
01:19:00,779 --> 01:19:01,380
Okay.

739
01:19:01,380 --> 01:19:06,800
I would imagine that's the blonde twerp.

740
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:07,600
You're...

741
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:08,100
What the fuck?

742
01:19:08,100 --> 01:19:09,199
You just hit two.

743
01:19:09,199 --> 01:19:11,970
What the hell's going on here?

744
01:19:11,970 --> 01:19:13,529
Am I right?

745
01:19:13,529 --> 01:19:15,869
Yes, that would be Armin Arlott.

746
01:19:15,869 --> 01:19:18,420
Yeah, that's him.

747
01:19:18,420 --> 01:19:19,119
I like that show.

748
01:19:19,119 --> 01:19:20,020
Do you like that show?

749
01:19:20,020 --> 01:19:21,350
I do.

750
01:19:21,350 --> 01:19:22,750
Do you watch a lot of anime?

751
01:19:22,750 --> 01:19:24,869
Do you consider yourself...?

752
01:19:24,869 --> 01:19:25,470
Once a year.

753
01:19:25,470 --> 01:19:27,369
I get myself one anime a year.

754
01:19:27,369 --> 01:19:29,899
That's what I'm allowed to do.

755
01:19:29,899 --> 01:19:33,479
That's just so you don't become a weeb or...?

756
01:19:33,479 --> 01:19:36,779
It's just because at time and, you know, there's a million animes.

757
01:19:36,779 --> 01:19:39,109
You get sucked in, you watch like a hundred of them.

758
01:19:39,109 --> 01:19:40,279
You're right.

759
01:19:40,279 --> 01:19:43,260
I get myself one anime a year.

760
01:19:43,260 --> 01:19:45,960
I only watch...

761
01:19:55,329 --> 01:19:57,829
No! No, he's got it.

762
01:19:57,829 --> 01:19:58,529
He's got it.

763
01:19:58,529 --> 01:20:00,029
Just one more and he's got it.

764
01:20:00,029 --> 01:20:01,229
Oh, thank the Lord.

765
01:20:01,229 --> 01:20:01,930
Now I have to find it.

766
01:20:01,930 --> 01:20:05,239
Everything's on to this.

767
01:20:05,239 --> 01:20:05,539
Right.

768
01:20:05,539 --> 01:20:10,020
It would be the greatest comeback of all time if you get this.

769
01:20:10,020 --> 01:20:13,460
There are two places where it could be.

770
01:20:13,460 --> 01:20:16,659
Because I don't think that you would put it this close.

771
01:20:16,659 --> 01:20:18,399
I don't.

772
01:20:18,399 --> 01:20:25,899
You're either right here, right here, or here.

773
01:20:25,899 --> 01:20:30,079
You want a hint?

774
01:20:30,079 --> 01:20:31,800
Uh...

775
01:20:31,800 --> 01:20:34,300
No, I don't trust your hints.

776
01:20:34,300 --> 01:20:35,199
I think you're one of these two.

777
01:20:35,199 --> 01:20:37,970
Give you a hint.

778
01:20:37,970 --> 01:20:45,020
Because this would be like a perfect map if it was like one of these two.

779
01:20:45,020 --> 01:20:56,079
I'll give you a simple hint and this is honest.

780
01:20:56,079 --> 01:21:00,949
Dude, that little tugboat, it was right next to my destroyers to the left of it.

781
01:21:00,949 --> 01:21:04,310
Oh, no!

782
01:21:04,310 --> 01:21:09,000
Oh, now I have to give you a hundred subs?

783
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:10,600
Let me tell you, you were right.

784
01:21:10,600 --> 01:21:11,739
You called it.

785
01:21:11,840 --> 01:21:15,439
You were like, oh, I've won these petty games for $75.

786
01:21:15,439 --> 01:21:20,340
And I have to wear the fucking cum t-shirt and pay you $500.

787
01:21:20,340 --> 01:21:22,039
This is exactly what happened.

788
01:21:22,039 --> 01:21:26,539
Taking you for all your worth, your pride, your dignity, and your wallet.

789
01:21:26,539 --> 01:21:27,840
I won the two games.

790
01:21:27,840 --> 01:21:29,739
This is like the pool shark.

791
01:21:29,739 --> 01:21:30,239
You know what I mean?

792
01:21:30,239 --> 01:21:32,939
Like, oh, hey, how about the first game for 20 bucks?

793
01:21:32,939 --> 01:21:34,840
And it's like, oh, man, I missed.

794
01:21:34,840 --> 01:21:36,239
I suck at pool.

795
01:21:36,239 --> 01:21:38,909
And then you just clean me out before I leave.

796
01:21:38,909 --> 01:21:42,250
That's exactly the plan.

797
01:21:42,250 --> 01:21:43,850
All right, well, draw it down.

798
01:21:43,850 --> 01:21:46,350
I'll get it to you at the end of the stream.

799
01:21:46,350 --> 01:21:47,250
Yeah, yeah, no rush.

800
01:21:47,250 --> 01:21:48,750
No rush.

801
01:21:48,750 --> 01:21:49,050
All right.

802
01:21:49,050 --> 01:21:54,050
So how much higher can we go with this one?

803
01:21:54,050 --> 01:22:00,350
So we could, we're going to reach a point of power creep where we've gone too high.

804
01:22:00,350 --> 01:22:00,850
Yes.

805
01:22:03,539 --> 01:22:05,939
And here's the thing about me.

806
01:22:05,939 --> 01:22:09,039
I live my life by the gambler's philosophy.

807
01:22:09,039 --> 01:22:13,840
So once I start to lose a little money, I'll dump my net worth till I get it back.

808
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:15,840
I don't think I'm the right guy to guide this ship.

809
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:21,550
I'll let you make the next bet.

810
01:22:21,550 --> 01:22:23,739
Well, that was a money one.

811
01:22:23,739 --> 01:22:25,399
Yeah, that was.

812
01:22:25,399 --> 01:22:29,529
So what if we up the stakes into a non-money one?

813
01:22:29,529 --> 01:22:31,470
What would it look like?

814
01:22:31,470 --> 01:22:33,970
I'll throw out a couple of things that work.

815
01:22:33,970 --> 01:22:37,699
One is a tweet.

816
01:22:37,699 --> 01:22:40,600
A tweet of the of the of the person's choosing.

817
01:22:40,600 --> 01:22:40,899
Uh-huh.

818
01:22:40,899 --> 01:22:41,600
Yeah.

819
01:22:41,600 --> 01:22:42,100
That's pretty good.

820
01:22:42,100 --> 01:22:46,260
I would get a tweet on your Twitter.

821
01:22:46,260 --> 01:22:48,189
Oh, those are rare.

822
01:22:48,189 --> 01:22:49,289
Those are rare.

823
01:22:49,289 --> 01:22:51,989
But it's it's it's pretty equal value.

824
01:22:51,989 --> 01:22:54,189
I would say because you rarely tweet.

825
01:22:54,189 --> 01:22:54,689
That's true.

826
01:22:54,689 --> 01:22:58,789
And I tweet pretty much all the time with my sponsored shit.

827
01:22:58,789 --> 01:23:01,989
Yeah, you probably have like five times the followers that I have.

828
01:23:01,989 --> 01:23:03,189
But I have a few more followers.

829
01:23:03,189 --> 01:23:03,590
Exactly.

830
01:23:03,590 --> 01:23:07,689
So it's about even because the rarity versus the just the followers.

831
01:23:07,689 --> 01:23:09,460
Okay, I like this one.

832
01:23:09,460 --> 01:23:11,960
Yeah, we get to you get to craft a tweet.

833
01:23:11,960 --> 01:23:17,399
Wait, is this like a so like it would be as if it was me tweeting, but you wrote the tweet.

834
01:23:17,399 --> 01:23:18,000
Exactly.

835
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:21,800
Yeah, you would never be able to explain because you know, we have a good amount of viewers here.

836
01:23:21,800 --> 01:23:24,100
But you know, we have hundreds of thousands of followers.

837
01:23:24,100 --> 01:23:28,899
You'd never be able to explain to those followers why that was tweeted or be like,

838
01:23:28,899 --> 01:23:32,000
oh, I had to tweet this because of some dumb bet.

839
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:35,579
Oh, yeah, it has to be like you just this is you talking.

840
01:23:35,579 --> 01:23:37,380
I'm going to show you an example of a tweet.

841
01:23:37,380 --> 01:23:42,880
I had to do because I lost a bet against, you know, disguised toast.

842
01:23:42,880 --> 01:23:45,939
Yes, I had lost a wager to him.

843
01:23:46,039 --> 01:23:48,539
And maybe this isn't the best to pull up on stream.

844
01:23:48,539 --> 01:23:53,180
But but here's the tweet regardless.

845
01:23:53,180 --> 01:23:55,640
I'm not a picture or video.

846
01:23:55,640 --> 01:24:00,840
Yes, but I would say I won't go as harsh as as as toasted.

847
01:24:00,840 --> 01:24:01,840
Do you see the tweet?

848
01:24:01,840 --> 01:24:04,439
Oh, let me see.

849
01:24:04,439 --> 01:24:06,340
I saw the pizza thing.

850
01:24:06,340 --> 01:24:09,590
What is this underwear?

851
01:24:09,590 --> 01:24:11,289
Is this you?

852
01:24:11,289 --> 01:24:12,390
This is my ass.

853
01:24:12,390 --> 01:24:14,989
It's a picture of me in briefs with the caption.

854
01:24:14,989 --> 01:24:20,010
Anyone want to sniff what the fuck?

855
01:24:20,010 --> 01:24:25,470
Toast was not he was not exactly gracious and victory.

856
01:24:25,470 --> 01:24:28,829
He was quite merciless.

857
01:24:28,829 --> 01:24:31,750
Anyone want a sniff?

858
01:24:31,750 --> 01:24:35,270
Yeah, and it's a picture of my butt in briefs.

859
01:24:35,270 --> 01:24:38,569
Okay, because I was going to say I was going to like just have you take a picture of like

860
01:24:38,569 --> 01:24:42,100
an apple core and just have the like the text over B.

861
01:24:42,100 --> 01:24:44,159
What the fuck, dude?

862
01:24:44,159 --> 01:24:47,600
And I mean, like something that like, yeah, that's what I was going to have you do.

863
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:49,300
No, that's that's what I would go for.

864
01:24:49,300 --> 01:24:52,800
I would I would this this is, you know, toast went all out.

865
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:54,699
I'm showing you this is like this is a high end.

866
01:24:54,699 --> 01:24:58,170
You know, it's probably like this is where it caps out.

867
01:24:58,170 --> 01:25:01,069
I'm not expecting this or going to do this if I won.

868
01:25:01,069 --> 01:25:04,270
And I don't I would hope, you know, you wouldn't do this to me if you won.

869
01:25:04,270 --> 01:25:06,970
It's more so an example of a tweet in the past.

870
01:25:06,970 --> 01:25:07,270
Okay.

871
01:25:07,270 --> 01:25:07,670
Hold on.

872
01:25:07,670 --> 01:25:08,970
I got to show this because it's important.

873
01:25:08,970 --> 01:25:13,250
I didn't even show it yet.

874
01:25:13,250 --> 01:25:20,380
There's maybe no eyebrows, but don't look at that one yet.

875
01:25:20,380 --> 01:25:25,640
That's a great thing to have right there.

876
01:25:25,640 --> 01:25:26,539
Just pull up your shoe.

877
01:25:26,539 --> 01:25:27,340
That's a bit of a zoom.

878
01:25:27,340 --> 01:25:30,239
Actually, that's going on.

879
01:25:30,239 --> 01:25:31,140
This is your ass.

880
01:25:31,140 --> 01:25:32,850
What what are you doing?

881
01:25:32,850 --> 01:25:38,960
I'm staring at a portrait of myself.

882
01:25:38,960 --> 01:25:41,159
By the way, I think that you have been the first person

883
01:25:41,159 --> 01:25:45,060
to ever have me show the word of become on my screen, by the way.

884
01:25:45,060 --> 01:25:47,760
Just want to make sure we're clear on that one.

885
01:25:47,760 --> 01:25:51,319
Should I be ashamed or proud?

886
01:25:51,319 --> 01:25:52,920
Probably probably both.

887
01:25:52,920 --> 01:25:55,880
It's a mixture.

888
01:25:55,880 --> 01:25:57,180
All right.

889
01:25:57,180 --> 01:25:58,180
So I think that's it.

890
01:25:58,180 --> 01:25:59,279
That's a fair wager.

891
01:25:59,279 --> 01:26:00,579
Oh, that's fair.

892
01:26:00,579 --> 01:26:03,329
Did you just purchase Sir Philip Wade?

893
01:26:03,329 --> 01:26:05,510
No, I didn't buy anything.

894
01:26:05,510 --> 01:26:08,710
It shows on my screen that you're playing a Sir Philip Wade.

895
01:26:08,710 --> 01:26:09,310
Wait, what?

896
01:26:09,310 --> 01:26:12,619
Yeah, what's going on?

897
01:26:12,619 --> 01:26:16,220
What's this?

898
01:26:16,220 --> 01:26:18,399
This is you?

899
01:26:18,399 --> 01:26:19,899
Yeah, I think this is we're in the same game.

900
01:26:19,899 --> 01:26:24,699
But for whatever reason, all right, I have a genius strategy

901
01:26:24,699 --> 01:26:26,960
to line my ships here.

902
01:26:26,960 --> 01:26:29,159
Can you give me a number between one and ten, please?

903
01:26:29,159 --> 01:26:39,930
Three.

904
01:26:39,930 --> 01:26:42,430
Now, are you under the impression that Battleship is somewhat

905
01:26:42,430 --> 01:26:43,630
of a skilled game?

906
01:26:43,630 --> 01:26:47,010
Yes, I think it's very I think this is going to be huge.

907
01:26:47,010 --> 01:26:47,409
Okay.

908
01:26:47,409 --> 01:26:48,569
Yeah.

909
01:26:48,569 --> 01:26:50,069
Do you not think so?

910
01:26:50,069 --> 01:26:51,970
No, it's not just asking questions.

911
01:26:51,970 --> 01:26:55,979
Yeah, like we are.

912
01:26:55,979 --> 01:26:58,779
This is like a this is a pre-show how everybody is going to

913
01:26:58,779 --> 01:26:59,779
be playing this.

914
01:26:59,779 --> 01:27:01,180
This is a huge deal, right?

915
01:27:01,180 --> 01:27:02,380
Like everyone's going to love this game.

916
01:27:02,380 --> 01:27:05,390
Everyone's going to get into it.

917
01:27:05,390 --> 01:27:08,689
Roof to you that this is a game made for children that that,

918
01:27:08,689 --> 01:27:13,619
you know, actual just trained monkeys would do better in.

919
01:27:13,619 --> 01:27:18,420
I've randomly placed my ships and I'm using a random picker

920
01:27:18,420 --> 01:27:25,140
to shoot your ships down randomized shot randomized placements

921
01:27:25,140 --> 01:27:30,210
against your strategies.

922
01:27:30,210 --> 01:27:37,300
So it will see if I was able to win with pure randomness that

923
01:27:37,300 --> 01:27:38,100
I proved to you.

924
01:27:38,100 --> 01:27:43,180
This is a game for little baby boy children.

925
01:27:43,180 --> 01:27:45,279
My strategy is not good.

926
01:27:45,279 --> 01:28:07,250
The best way to go about this is to do it twice, which is

927
01:28:07,250 --> 01:28:08,850
there's no way.

928
01:28:08,850 --> 01:28:11,649
I mean, no, there is no way you know where you can get it.

929
01:28:11,649 --> 01:28:22,189
It's that yeah, that's one space.

930
01:28:22,189 --> 01:28:26,880
That was another another bat behind the back swish attempt.

931
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:30,380
I'm random number generating every single hit you are.

932
01:28:30,380 --> 01:28:34,399
Yeah, what?

933
01:28:34,399 --> 01:28:35,710
Yes.

934
01:28:35,710 --> 01:28:41,729
So every time I hit so you'd randomly generating the number

935
01:28:41,729 --> 01:28:42,430
and the letter.

936
01:28:42,430 --> 01:28:46,199
Yeah, I'm just basically doing to one through tens and then

937
01:28:46,199 --> 01:28:53,039
just cow first down and then over well shit.

938
01:28:53,039 --> 01:28:54,939
That's a huge advantage for me.

939
01:28:54,939 --> 01:28:56,170
We'll see.

940
01:28:56,170 --> 01:29:07,050
I have a feeling that this is an impeccable strategy and actually

941
01:29:07,050 --> 01:29:11,079
might be very good in 95% of every game.

942
01:29:20,399 --> 01:29:23,970
Are you committing to this the whole game?

943
01:29:23,970 --> 01:29:30,640
I think I might follow up on some of the reds because random

944
01:29:30,640 --> 01:29:32,539
number generators don't do well after a hit.

945
01:29:32,539 --> 01:29:33,140
Mm-hmm.

946
01:29:33,140 --> 01:29:40,819
Oh, no.

947
01:29:40,819 --> 01:29:43,529
All right.

948
01:29:43,529 --> 01:29:44,130
You're right here.

949
01:29:44,130 --> 01:29:46,060
You always put one here.

950
01:29:46,060 --> 01:29:47,060
Oh, no.

951
01:29:47,060 --> 01:29:47,659
What?

952
01:29:47,659 --> 01:29:48,460
That's your poker face.

953
01:29:48,460 --> 01:29:49,659
You always discovered me.

954
01:29:49,659 --> 01:29:50,359
Yeah.

955
01:29:50,359 --> 01:29:51,159
All right.

956
01:29:51,159 --> 01:29:52,359
Or North South East West.

957
01:29:52,359 --> 01:29:55,159
That doesn't matter how many pairs of hoods and sunglasses

958
01:29:55,159 --> 01:29:55,560
you put on.

959
01:29:55,560 --> 01:29:56,560
I can see right through this.

960
01:29:56,560 --> 01:29:57,659
I know you have one here every time.

961
01:29:57,659 --> 01:30:04,729
All right.

962
01:30:04,729 --> 01:30:08,260
North South East or West North North South East or West

963
01:30:08,260 --> 01:30:08,859
North again.

964
01:30:09,699 --> 01:30:10,199
There we go.

965
01:30:10,199 --> 01:30:12,100
Oh, all right.

966
01:30:12,100 --> 01:30:12,500
All right.

967
01:30:12,979 --> 01:30:17,689
Let me do one more random and then I'm going to try following

968
01:30:17,689 --> 01:30:17,989
up.

969
01:30:20,279 --> 01:30:20,680
Yeah.

970
01:30:21,779 --> 01:30:23,079
The longer this goes the worse.

971
01:30:23,079 --> 01:30:24,279
I feel like my strategy is.

972
01:30:25,500 --> 01:30:28,500
Okay, there goes your destroyer, but that's the easiest one.

973
01:30:28,699 --> 01:30:29,500
I want to find you.

974
01:30:29,500 --> 01:30:29,899
This one.

975
01:30:34,220 --> 01:30:38,060
Oh, I still think you did something like that.

976
01:30:38,060 --> 01:30:40,680
I'm bad at counting.

977
01:30:40,680 --> 01:30:41,279
It turns out.

978
01:30:46,109 --> 01:30:46,510
Hmm.

979
01:30:48,300 --> 01:30:52,060
I think I think you did something like this.

980
01:30:52,060 --> 01:30:52,859
I really do.

981
01:30:53,359 --> 01:30:56,359
Well, you have to understand I'm not lying to you.

982
01:30:56,359 --> 01:30:57,760
I randomized it.

983
01:31:00,199 --> 01:31:00,800
Oh, okay.

984
01:31:00,800 --> 01:31:01,699
All right for this one.

985
01:31:01,699 --> 01:31:02,699
Oh wait, you didn't.

986
01:31:02,699 --> 01:31:03,699
Oh, I see what you mean.

987
01:31:04,199 --> 01:31:06,100
And the ships were randomly placed.

988
01:31:06,100 --> 01:31:06,899
Oh, all right.

989
01:31:06,899 --> 01:31:08,699
So that actually is an advantage for me.

990
01:31:08,800 --> 01:31:11,699
Although you coincidentally did get my destroyer.

991
01:31:15,500 --> 01:31:16,399
Oh my gosh.

992
01:31:16,500 --> 01:31:19,199
Yeah, if you go to the right here, this is brutal.

993
01:31:24,449 --> 01:31:26,949
I'm thinking somebody faces into my face cam like every time

994
01:31:26,949 --> 01:31:30,590
like I click I turn I go like I'm just such a good fucking

995
01:31:30,590 --> 01:31:31,489
YouTube face.

996
01:31:33,090 --> 01:31:36,090
All right, whatever you got you good reactions destroyer.

997
01:31:36,489 --> 01:31:36,989
Okay.

998
01:31:37,590 --> 01:31:38,189
Yeah.

999
01:31:38,189 --> 01:31:39,189
Yeah, whatever.

1000
01:31:40,989 --> 01:31:41,390
All right.

1001
01:31:42,409 --> 01:31:43,210
Seven six.

1002
01:31:47,439 --> 01:31:47,939
All right.

1003
01:31:48,039 --> 01:31:50,539
Well, whatever you got that one where we're even now.

1004
01:31:50,739 --> 01:31:54,039
It's perfectly even unless you happened to hit something

1005
01:31:54,039 --> 01:31:54,439
here.

1006
01:31:54,739 --> 01:31:57,010
Oh, you don't.

1007
01:32:02,920 --> 01:32:07,760
Oh, this would be a funny one funny one.

1008
01:32:07,760 --> 01:32:09,960
Why funny is there a Jason?

1009
01:32:10,359 --> 01:32:16,899
Yeah, that would be actually very funny humorous in a way.

1010
01:32:17,600 --> 01:32:18,800
That would be very funny.

1011
01:32:19,670 --> 01:32:23,710
I get it was randomly generated ships and it would be

1012
01:32:23,810 --> 01:32:26,010
it would freak me out if you actually did that that'd be

1013
01:32:26,010 --> 01:32:26,710
so funny.

1014
01:32:28,090 --> 01:32:28,489
Okay.

1015
01:32:28,689 --> 01:32:29,090
All right.

1016
01:32:29,489 --> 01:32:31,090
I might abandon my strategy here.

1017
01:32:32,470 --> 01:32:35,069
I'm realizing this this guy I might swing over to your

1018
01:32:35,069 --> 01:32:35,270
side.

1019
01:32:35,270 --> 01:32:36,270
This could be a game of skill.

1020
01:32:36,369 --> 01:32:38,069
It's incredibly frivolous what you're up to.

1021
01:32:38,899 --> 01:32:39,699
How are you not down there?

1022
01:32:40,859 --> 01:32:42,859
I don't know.

1023
01:32:42,960 --> 01:32:43,159
Okay.

1024
01:32:43,159 --> 01:32:44,260
You hate the edges.

1025
01:32:44,260 --> 01:32:58,090
You love the center fail again and for what right I left

1026
01:32:58,090 --> 01:33:03,979
the right you're right.

1027
01:33:04,380 --> 01:33:05,180
Yeah, this is it right here.

1028
01:33:05,479 --> 01:33:07,180
Oh, come on.

1029
01:33:08,500 --> 01:33:12,680
I tried to sway you with the left or right.

1030
01:33:13,350 --> 01:33:15,350
Yeah, I would I would say you're flailing right now.

1031
01:33:15,350 --> 01:33:23,449
If it were me what is on the line here a tweet a tweet what

1032
01:33:23,449 --> 01:33:27,520
I would love to tweet on your Twitter account for sure.

1033
01:33:31,510 --> 01:33:32,909
Finally, it's my turn.

1034
01:33:38,510 --> 01:33:40,109
I think the computer went that way.

1035
01:33:42,409 --> 01:33:44,210
You think the computer has rhyme or reason.

1036
01:33:44,310 --> 01:33:49,020
Oh fuck a phenomenal hit that was randomly generated.

1037
01:33:49,520 --> 01:33:53,989
Oh, did you did you t-bone yourself t-bone?

1038
01:33:53,989 --> 01:33:54,590
What does that mean?

1039
01:33:55,220 --> 01:33:59,600
Like did you put a ship going into your ship so that it

1040
01:33:59,600 --> 01:34:04,170
would be a collision that would be very unwise.

1041
01:34:05,100 --> 01:34:08,100
Oh, you connected it to you actually t-boned yourself.

1042
01:34:10,260 --> 01:34:12,359
There's no confirmation that that's what happened.

1043
01:34:12,960 --> 01:34:16,920
Well, if there's a what do you think the ship pulls a

1044
01:34:16,920 --> 01:34:18,119
last-second left turn?

1045
01:34:18,119 --> 01:34:19,319
It's an L-shaped ship.

1046
01:34:19,800 --> 01:34:20,000
All right.

1047
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:21,500
I'm gonna have to freeze Ludwig.

1048
01:34:23,960 --> 01:34:28,800
I have a feeling did you grow up Catholic at all?

1049
01:34:29,300 --> 01:34:32,439
Yeah, okay.

1050
01:34:32,909 --> 01:34:35,210
I thought per chance there was a there was a cross of

1051
01:34:35,210 --> 01:34:41,220
David or that doesn't make any sense of Christ.

1052
01:34:41,819 --> 01:34:42,420
Come on.

1053
01:34:42,420 --> 01:34:43,319
How are you not there?

1054
01:34:43,819 --> 01:34:45,020
Okay, back to my strat.

1055
01:34:47,260 --> 01:34:48,859
What a oh, I already done it.

1056
01:34:50,060 --> 01:34:51,060
Then I'll just do my own.

1057
01:34:54,479 --> 01:34:59,270
What's your favorite animal favorite animal?

1058
01:34:59,270 --> 01:35:03,369
What's your favorite animal is a zebra zebra finds a frog.

1059
01:35:04,479 --> 01:35:10,930
Why I kind of just like word you the the reason it's your

1060
01:35:10,930 --> 01:35:12,430
favorite is because of the word.

1061
01:35:12,430 --> 01:35:14,430
I've enjoyed the word especially the letters.

1062
01:35:17,020 --> 01:35:18,220
I love that green frog.

1063
01:35:21,920 --> 01:35:31,739
Are you hinting at something could it be?

1064
01:35:34,229 --> 01:35:36,329
Does he need more tweets?

1065
01:35:41,079 --> 01:35:42,479
What did your computer do?

1066
01:35:47,279 --> 01:35:49,180
That was a terrible shot by the computer.

1067
01:35:52,710 --> 01:35:54,109
No, I'm all right.

1068
01:35:54,210 --> 01:35:54,810
It's right here.

1069
01:35:55,689 --> 01:35:56,689
How is it possible?

1070
01:35:56,689 --> 01:35:58,090
They all have probably up top.

1071
01:36:00,210 --> 01:36:07,810
I would never say you definitely there's no way you're

1072
01:36:07,810 --> 01:36:09,939
not up here somewhere.

1073
01:36:10,239 --> 01:36:12,039
This thing is statistically impossible.

1074
01:36:12,340 --> 01:36:18,279
I promise you that northbound will be in your your undoing

1075
01:36:20,039 --> 01:36:20,539
you think so.

1076
01:36:20,539 --> 01:36:21,840
There's no way you're here.

1077
01:36:30,840 --> 01:36:37,270
With these apps could a strategy be so simple that he's

1078
01:36:37,270 --> 01:36:39,770
trying to get me to go in the effort where nothing is.

1079
01:36:46,760 --> 01:36:47,760
Oh my God.

1080
01:36:59,319 --> 01:37:00,520
What are you up to over there?

1081
01:37:00,520 --> 01:37:02,020
Jerma nothing nothing.

1082
01:37:06,220 --> 01:37:10,859
I could really take this home, but I'm going in everything

1083
01:37:10,859 --> 01:37:13,659
that every place that you're not is impossible.

1084
01:37:14,619 --> 01:37:16,189
That's a re redo.

1085
01:37:19,039 --> 01:37:20,140
Is that random or was that you?

1086
01:37:21,140 --> 01:37:24,439
I had it had already been on that spot the one that it

1087
01:37:24,439 --> 01:37:24,840
selected.

1088
01:37:24,840 --> 01:37:27,420
So I went it's kind of my rule.

1089
01:37:27,520 --> 01:37:30,020
It's random unless it already had picked it picked one

1090
01:37:30,020 --> 01:37:30,920
that's already been shot.

1091
01:37:41,470 --> 01:37:41,770
All right.

1092
01:37:41,770 --> 01:37:43,670
You have just have little ones left right here.

1093
01:37:44,470 --> 01:37:46,170
I got a couple little ones.

1094
01:37:46,170 --> 01:37:46,970
Yeah, that's right.

1095
01:37:47,170 --> 01:37:49,369
I mean you have just a lot left.

1096
01:37:49,369 --> 01:37:51,069
I do have quite a bit ones currently.

1097
01:37:51,069 --> 01:37:52,170
You have right on this one.

1098
01:37:55,340 --> 01:37:57,750
Maybe you have a four somewhere.

1099
01:37:57,750 --> 01:37:57,949
All right.

1100
01:37:57,949 --> 01:37:59,350
This is this is me going here.

1101
01:38:00,250 --> 01:38:11,560
I could cover that was such a bad shot.

1102
01:38:12,159 --> 01:38:13,260
It was just a bad shot.

1103
01:38:15,699 --> 01:38:19,960
Oh, oh, come on.

1104
01:38:20,260 --> 01:38:20,859
There's no more.

1105
01:38:20,859 --> 01:38:22,359
How many more places can you be?

1106
01:38:23,460 --> 01:38:24,260
Three two.

1107
01:38:29,739 --> 01:38:35,039
I think well, you've you've left entire sections open.

1108
01:38:36,670 --> 01:38:39,699
Yeah, maybe a little bit or three.

1109
01:38:39,699 --> 01:38:42,699
What a terrible what a terrible follow-up.

1110
01:38:42,699 --> 01:38:45,800
There's this is the worst randomly generated shot of all

1111
01:38:45,800 --> 01:38:46,100
time.

1112
01:38:46,100 --> 01:38:49,899
It only hits a tugboat that just happens to be adjacent.

1113
01:38:53,100 --> 01:38:54,699
Maybe you are like right here.

1114
01:38:56,930 --> 01:39:01,930
No one three.

1115
01:39:02,229 --> 01:39:03,729
They're actually screwing me.

1116
01:39:04,430 --> 01:39:06,130
Look, you see I've done like a row.

1117
01:39:06,529 --> 01:39:08,229
I'm just cleaning out entire row.

1118
01:39:11,840 --> 01:39:15,140
I'm suddenly thinking the strategy is not impeccable.

1119
01:39:16,670 --> 01:39:17,970
I think that's we've already done that.

1120
01:39:18,569 --> 01:39:19,170
Yeah, we have.

1121
01:39:19,170 --> 01:39:19,569
Okay.

1122
01:39:19,569 --> 01:39:20,270
It's me again.

1123
01:39:20,810 --> 01:39:24,210
Do you let's let's let's clear out.

1124
01:39:25,460 --> 01:39:29,529
Let's clear out this one here covers up and down for three.

1125
01:39:30,869 --> 01:39:31,270
Hmm.

1126
01:39:33,189 --> 01:39:37,100
I have to assume that you're because you have a two, you know

1127
01:39:37,100 --> 01:39:40,300
what I like, but you have to understand this was not me.

1128
01:39:40,840 --> 01:39:41,640
This was not you.

1129
01:39:41,640 --> 01:39:42,239
That's right.

1130
01:39:42,739 --> 01:39:50,159
It doesn't matter if I'm a middle man in go in go.

1131
01:39:51,840 --> 01:39:52,140
All right.

1132
01:39:52,140 --> 01:39:56,409
There we go and eight.

1133
01:39:56,409 --> 01:39:57,409
We've already done that.

1134
01:40:09,420 --> 01:40:10,420
What are you laughing at?

1135
01:40:10,920 --> 01:40:14,300
Nothing just I mean, there's a bit of laughter.

1136
01:40:14,399 --> 01:40:16,699
It was a little bit of laughter, but it was kind of humorous

1137
01:40:16,699 --> 01:40:17,399
what just happened.

1138
01:40:19,220 --> 01:40:27,210
Me shooting was kind of humorous back back in this bullshit

1139
01:40:27,210 --> 01:40:27,409
again.

1140
01:40:27,409 --> 01:40:28,409
We're where your two is.

1141
01:40:30,189 --> 01:40:45,949
I mean, I guess you aren't random got one.

1142
01:40:48,220 --> 01:40:56,890
Is that the letter F was no what a terrible round to do

1143
01:40:56,890 --> 01:40:58,789
randomly generated shots on.

1144
01:40:58,789 --> 01:41:06,550
I know it's not over.

1145
01:41:06,550 --> 01:41:08,250
It's not even close to being over.

1146
01:41:08,750 --> 01:41:12,199
No, especially considering I found your two.

1147
01:41:13,350 --> 01:41:14,250
Well, good for me.

1148
01:41:14,250 --> 01:41:14,949
You did what?

1149
01:41:15,250 --> 01:41:24,760
No, it's not my two seven ten going in Shirley.

1150
01:41:25,260 --> 01:41:26,260
It has to be a three or two.

1151
01:41:26,260 --> 01:41:27,359
No, it's going up.

1152
01:41:28,470 --> 01:41:32,960
Damn it should have I shouldn't have talked myself out shit.

1153
01:41:34,590 --> 01:41:35,890
Okay, that you too.

1154
01:41:36,189 --> 01:41:38,250
No, no, this is a three.

1155
01:41:38,250 --> 01:41:39,050
It's up or down here.

1156
01:41:39,550 --> 01:41:39,949
Okay.

1157
01:41:40,050 --> 01:41:40,550
All right.

1158
01:41:40,649 --> 01:41:41,250
All right.

1159
01:41:41,750 --> 01:41:43,949
I got I got I got a nail this right now.

1160
01:41:44,050 --> 01:41:47,750
Okay, this you have struggled on twos before there are 3000

1161
01:41:47,750 --> 01:41:48,050
places.

1162
01:41:48,050 --> 01:41:55,119
This one could be there are but all right, you're going in.

1163
01:41:56,300 --> 01:41:57,399
I painted around this.

1164
01:41:57,399 --> 01:42:00,399
I've genuinely painted around this one the Lords.

1165
01:42:00,699 --> 01:42:01,000
All right.

1166
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:02,199
You got a good shot here.

1167
01:42:02,500 --> 01:42:02,899
Okay.

1168
01:42:03,789 --> 01:42:04,390
And by good shot.

1169
01:42:04,390 --> 01:42:09,439
I mean it could be anywhere it could this could be B 10 C 10.

1170
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:14,199
All right.

1171
01:42:14,199 --> 01:42:19,880
I'm going down now and that means the only ship left is a

1172
01:42:19,880 --> 01:42:20,779
three-man boat.

1173
01:42:20,779 --> 01:42:24,380
I don't think a randomly generated thing functions as well

1174
01:42:24,380 --> 01:42:24,880
anymore.

1175
01:42:27,529 --> 01:42:30,029
Cause there's there's three where is there a three is could

1176
01:42:30,029 --> 01:42:32,529
be this here doesn't places.

1177
01:42:42,909 --> 01:42:45,250
Yeah, that was a weird choice.

1178
01:42:45,449 --> 01:42:48,029
It was because you could have gotten left one and covered

1179
01:42:48,029 --> 01:42:48,329
more.

1180
01:42:54,729 --> 01:42:59,510
Okay, I'm a bit stressed out right now.

1181
01:42:59,810 --> 01:43:00,609
I am too.

1182
01:43:08,640 --> 01:43:10,340
This this covers a lot.

1183
01:43:15,720 --> 01:43:18,920
No, I have to think about this is no longer random surely

1184
01:43:18,920 --> 01:43:21,619
you didn't do anything to muddy the letter F.

1185
01:43:21,819 --> 01:43:25,800
So this must have been a displaced boat to have somewhat

1186
01:43:25,800 --> 01:43:33,579
of a coverage in case I found the F it could be like a J 3.

1187
01:43:37,159 --> 01:43:38,659
No, we should have done one more to the right.

1188
01:43:39,590 --> 01:43:41,590
It could be a really tall F.

1189
01:43:42,699 --> 01:43:45,810
I mean that would be interesting if I were to do something

1190
01:43:45,810 --> 01:43:46,609
like that, wouldn't it?

1191
01:43:48,079 --> 01:43:50,079
I can't tell if you're trying to convince me not to do it.

1192
01:43:51,840 --> 01:43:57,579
I guess I I thought the F was over but it could have just

1193
01:43:57,579 --> 01:43:58,380
been beginning.

1194
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:01,399
I mean that was very interesting.

1195
01:44:01,800 --> 01:44:03,399
If I were you I would maybe take a shot.

1196
01:44:06,279 --> 01:44:07,479
Wait, you did do that.

1197
01:44:07,479 --> 01:44:12,279
Yeah, why don't you tell me that I was doing the psychology

1198
01:44:12,279 --> 01:44:13,779
thing where you're like, oh, why would you tell me?

1199
01:44:15,979 --> 01:44:18,579
I thought you're telling no, no have to tweet something.

1200
01:44:20,180 --> 01:44:26,550
What a tall F I was going to do the whole thing, but I figured

1201
01:44:26,649 --> 01:44:27,949
of course it was right there.

1202
01:44:29,189 --> 01:44:31,890
Yeah, the randomly generated was terrible.

1203
01:44:31,890 --> 01:44:34,390
I mean you didn't have the best stratagem for sure.

1204
01:44:34,390 --> 01:44:36,390
But I lost the last three in a row.

1205
01:44:36,390 --> 01:44:37,989
I won the first like two or three in a row.

1206
01:44:39,140 --> 01:44:39,939
You know what it is.

1207
01:44:39,939 --> 01:44:43,239
It's whoever gets the tugboat first almost just assuredly

1208
01:44:43,239 --> 01:44:43,739
wins.

1209
01:44:43,739 --> 01:44:48,140
Yeah, cuz finding the tugboat as the last thing is it's miserable.

1210
01:44:49,979 --> 01:44:50,880
It's the worst.

1211
01:44:51,720 --> 01:44:54,520
So I have a I have a I have a tweet now.

1212
01:44:54,819 --> 01:44:56,420
Yeah, you get to have a tweet.

1213
01:44:56,960 --> 01:44:58,760
This is this is valuable.

1214
01:44:59,359 --> 01:45:02,630
I mean, this is this is I tweet something maybe once every

1215
01:45:02,630 --> 01:45:03,729
like four months.

1216
01:45:04,329 --> 01:45:08,949
Yeah, you're not a the most avid Twitter user is a reason

1217
01:45:08,949 --> 01:45:09,449
for that.

1218
01:45:10,239 --> 01:45:12,539
Yeah, it's kind of you know, just don't care.

1219
01:45:13,340 --> 01:45:14,239
Yeah, sure.

1220
01:45:15,739 --> 01:45:18,039
You know, I think it is because I can never think of anything

1221
01:45:18,039 --> 01:45:20,739
to say I have somebody drafted tweets that is right and then

1222
01:45:20,739 --> 01:45:22,829
I just delete right.

1223
01:45:23,130 --> 01:45:26,229
See what I'll do is I'll send it and then I'll and I'll delete

1224
01:45:26,229 --> 01:45:31,500
it which I think is harder to do because sometimes after you

1225
01:45:31,500 --> 01:45:33,699
already said to you don't want to delete it which which makes

1226
01:45:33,699 --> 01:45:34,699
me tweet more often.

1227
01:45:34,899 --> 01:45:35,500
Exactly.

1228
01:45:36,359 --> 01:45:38,060
I'll read you my last two drafts.

1229
01:45:38,460 --> 01:45:39,060
Yeah, please.

1230
01:45:39,859 --> 01:45:42,859
Fortnite is starting to look a lot like those old Smash Brothers

1231
01:45:42,859 --> 01:45:45,960
character leak screens the ones with Heathcliff Pepper Anne

1232
01:45:45,960 --> 01:45:53,720
and Al Bundy on them in the other one if almonds are available

1233
01:45:53,720 --> 01:45:55,119
I'll eat them till I throw up.

1234
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:03,600
All right.

1235
01:46:04,859 --> 01:46:05,960
Can you speak on that one?

1236
01:46:08,420 --> 01:46:10,119
I just I don't know if a bag of almonds is there.

1237
01:46:10,119 --> 01:46:11,619
I'm just going to keep eating him till somebody tells me

1238
01:46:11,619 --> 01:46:17,010
to stop eating them, but I didn't know those I did though

1239
01:46:17,010 --> 01:46:22,310
those I'm like, yeah, do you do you have the ability to

1240
01:46:23,640 --> 01:46:25,239
to protrude your stomach?

1241
01:46:26,260 --> 01:46:31,060
Yes, like in a pretty severe way that people would think,

1242
01:46:31,060 --> 01:46:32,460
you know, you're working on a baby.

1243
01:46:32,939 --> 01:46:36,439
Wait, you want you want a jokey stomach protruding like

1244
01:46:36,439 --> 01:46:39,939
in the okay, not just in a mirror like in the oven reflection

1245
01:46:40,420 --> 01:46:42,319
that you see and you go holy shit.

1246
01:46:42,319 --> 01:46:43,020
Is that me?

1247
01:46:43,680 --> 01:46:49,390
Yeah, is that something you're capable of doing?

1248
01:46:49,960 --> 01:46:51,659
Do you want a stomach protrusion picture?

1249
01:46:51,659 --> 01:46:54,619
Okay, how waste up full body?

1250
01:46:55,159 --> 01:46:59,060
I think a stomach protrusion picture with with your second

1251
01:46:59,060 --> 01:47:09,229
drafted tweet is you want that to be honest use you tweet

1252
01:47:09,229 --> 01:47:12,720
so rarely that anything is great here.

1253
01:47:12,920 --> 01:47:15,720
So you want if almonds are available.

1254
01:47:16,020 --> 01:47:18,720
I will eat them till I throw up and do the like I got a

1255
01:47:18,720 --> 01:47:20,119
big stomach picture.

1256
01:47:20,220 --> 01:47:24,399
Yeah, like, you know, kind of like how Twitter would be

1257
01:47:24,399 --> 01:47:26,899
used in like 2013.

1258
01:47:28,199 --> 01:47:28,800
God.

1259
01:47:29,819 --> 01:47:33,479
Okay, I'll do it.

1260
01:47:34,020 --> 01:47:37,319
Just I could eat almonds till I throw up and then you know,

1261
01:47:37,319 --> 01:47:39,819
your stomach so full because you've eaten so many almonds.

1262
01:47:39,819 --> 01:47:42,109
It's it's comical in a way.

1263
01:47:44,829 --> 01:47:45,229
All right.

1264
01:47:45,630 --> 01:47:46,430
This sounds good to me.

1265
01:47:47,130 --> 01:47:47,329
All right.

1266
01:47:47,329 --> 01:47:47,630
What do you want?

1267
01:47:47,630 --> 01:47:48,430
What do you want my hands?

1268
01:47:49,619 --> 01:47:52,619
Am I like like holding it like like underneath like it's

1269
01:47:52,619 --> 01:47:56,319
a big globe or like a big bug juggly or what am I doing?

1270
01:47:56,760 --> 01:48:01,279
I think you create creatively can can take this any direction

1271
01:48:01,279 --> 01:48:03,779
you want because I think you know what my sentiment what

1272
01:48:03,779 --> 01:48:07,579
my what my desire is here and you can you can get it done.

1273
01:48:09,489 --> 01:48:11,689
Somebody said this is literally fetish art.

1274
01:48:14,109 --> 01:48:19,260
It does feel like any time you even like any part of you

1275
01:48:19,260 --> 01:48:22,829
that you give out to your stream is just is just taken

1276
01:48:22,829 --> 01:48:24,329
and they just run with it.

1277
01:48:24,529 --> 01:48:26,729
There's going to be fan art for years on pregnant.

1278
01:48:26,729 --> 01:48:27,229
Germa.

1279
01:48:30,479 --> 01:48:31,680
I'll do my I'll do my best.

1280
01:48:34,909 --> 01:48:35,109
All right.

1281
01:48:35,109 --> 01:48:36,010
Can I go pee?

1282
01:48:37,130 --> 01:48:37,430
Yeah.

1283
01:48:39,829 --> 01:48:40,529
Yeah, please.

1284
01:48:40,529 --> 01:48:41,229
Please enjoy.

1285
01:48:41,729 --> 01:48:42,630
I'll be right back.

1286
01:48:43,260 --> 01:48:43,960
I'm going to go pee.

1287
01:48:44,399 --> 01:48:45,399
I'm looking forward to this.

1288
01:48:46,069 --> 01:48:46,869
Yeah, of course.

1289
01:48:46,869 --> 01:48:47,270
Of course.

1290
01:52:38,920 --> 01:52:39,119
All right.

1291
01:52:39,119 --> 01:52:39,619
I'm back.

1292
01:52:42,899 --> 01:52:43,100
All right.

1293
01:52:43,100 --> 01:52:43,600
I'm back.

1294
01:52:46,699 --> 01:52:48,300
It was one of those times where you pee.

1295
01:52:48,399 --> 01:52:53,760
It just doesn't stop.

1296
01:52:53,960 --> 01:52:54,460
You know what I mean?

1297
01:53:00,560 --> 01:53:01,859
Oh, did he just go afk?

1298
01:53:05,479 --> 01:53:05,779
All right.

1299
01:53:05,779 --> 01:53:06,579
Well, whatever we can wait.

1300
01:53:06,579 --> 01:53:15,279
We can have why you guys not playing the advanced game

1301
01:53:15,279 --> 01:53:15,880
mode.

1302
01:53:19,720 --> 01:53:24,840
I mean you play classic is an advanced game mode.

1303
01:53:29,250 --> 01:53:30,250
It will do that in a minute.

1304
01:53:33,069 --> 01:53:34,670
When we talked about doing the stream was just like,

1305
01:53:34,670 --> 01:53:36,369
oh, maybe we'll play this like 45 minutes.

1306
01:53:36,770 --> 01:53:37,569
Maybe do something else.

1307
01:53:37,569 --> 01:53:38,670
I'm very invested.

1308
01:53:40,239 --> 01:53:43,939
I have to try to at least make some what I may I got $70

1309
01:53:43,939 --> 01:53:45,439
the first like two or three games.

1310
01:53:46,359 --> 01:53:48,560
So let's let me get let's let's break this down a little bit.

1311
01:53:48,960 --> 01:53:52,960
So I won the first few games and I got 70 bucks.

1312
01:53:53,630 --> 01:53:58,729
He won the last few games and gets $500 a tweet on my Twitch

1313
01:53:59,130 --> 01:54:00,930
and gets to make me wear a cum t-shirt.

1314
01:54:03,699 --> 01:54:04,399
This is fierce.

1315
01:54:04,399 --> 01:54:05,600
That's a little skewed.

1316
01:54:08,600 --> 01:54:10,100
I have to win one of the big ones.

1317
01:54:10,100 --> 01:54:11,199
I got to win a big one.

1318
01:54:13,710 --> 01:54:15,310
I actually got pool shark.

1319
01:54:19,409 --> 01:54:20,409
You get a free shirt though.

1320
01:54:20,409 --> 01:54:21,010
That's right.

1321
01:54:24,430 --> 01:54:25,430
Five gifted.

1322
01:54:34,539 --> 01:54:36,640
Why do you have such a hard time saying the word penis?

1323
01:54:36,640 --> 01:54:40,590
Please explain like that time.

1324
01:54:40,590 --> 01:54:41,489
You thought your zipper was down.

1325
01:54:41,489 --> 01:54:43,890
You almost said the word penis five times but stopped.

1326
01:54:43,890 --> 01:54:44,390
I don't know.

1327
01:54:52,680 --> 01:54:53,479
I said it there.

1328
01:54:58,760 --> 01:54:59,159
Hello.

1329
01:55:00,319 --> 01:55:01,119
How are you?

1330
01:55:02,850 --> 01:55:03,250
Good.

1331
01:55:03,250 --> 01:55:04,449
Just just pissed.

1332
01:55:04,850 --> 01:55:05,250
Yes.

1333
01:55:05,250 --> 01:55:05,649
Why?

1334
01:55:06,850 --> 01:55:07,350
Why?

1335
01:55:08,760 --> 01:55:09,659
Oh, you went to the bathroom.

1336
01:55:09,659 --> 01:55:10,159
You went pee.

1337
01:55:10,460 --> 01:55:12,460
I thought you meant that I'm just sitting here pissed like I took

1338
01:55:12,460 --> 01:55:13,260
too long or something.

1339
01:55:13,560 --> 01:55:14,159
No, no.

1340
01:55:14,159 --> 01:55:17,359
I had to go, you know, I had to go to the bathroom.

1341
01:55:17,359 --> 01:55:18,760
Do you pee sitting down by the way?

1342
01:55:18,960 --> 01:55:19,260
No.

1343
01:55:20,189 --> 01:55:21,390
Have you ever used a bidet?

1344
01:55:22,250 --> 01:55:24,149
No, I find them to be revolting.

1345
01:55:24,949 --> 01:55:25,449
What?

1346
01:55:25,850 --> 01:55:26,250
Yes.

1347
01:55:27,149 --> 01:55:28,149
Are you a bidet user?

1348
01:55:30,199 --> 01:55:33,699
This is going to fracture us in a way.

1349
01:55:33,800 --> 01:55:34,300
Are you sure?

1350
01:55:34,899 --> 01:55:35,800
I need to be enlightened.

1351
01:55:35,800 --> 01:55:36,300
Explain to me.

1352
01:55:36,300 --> 01:55:38,500
So let me let me tell you what I think when I think of a bidet.

1353
01:55:39,600 --> 01:55:42,140
So when you after you're done with the bathroom, if you go to

1354
01:55:42,140 --> 01:55:43,739
the bathroom, you finish just over.

1355
01:55:44,659 --> 01:55:46,659
Turning a water jet into your asshole.

1356
01:55:47,199 --> 01:55:50,199
Wouldn't you get shit and poop water all over your legs and

1357
01:55:50,199 --> 01:55:52,300
butt and stuff and have to make more work for yourself?

1358
01:55:52,300 --> 01:55:52,699
I don't understand.

1359
01:55:52,699 --> 01:55:53,300
Explain it to me.

1360
01:55:53,300 --> 01:55:53,800
I need it.

1361
01:55:53,800 --> 01:55:54,300
I need to know.

1362
01:55:54,979 --> 01:55:55,380
Right.

1363
01:55:55,380 --> 01:55:55,779
Okay.

1364
01:55:55,779 --> 01:55:56,079
All right.

1365
01:55:56,079 --> 01:55:59,579
That first of all, I'm not going to come at you.

1366
01:55:59,579 --> 01:56:02,579
You just seem to be a little bit ignorant on on all the

1367
01:56:02,579 --> 01:56:03,279
positives.

1368
01:56:03,279 --> 01:56:05,079
So I don't want to shame you.

1369
01:56:05,810 --> 01:56:11,149
Second of all, it's it's the greatest thing I've ever used

1370
01:56:11,149 --> 01:56:12,350
has changed my life.

1371
01:56:12,350 --> 01:56:13,750
I'm a bidet, not just a user.

1372
01:56:13,750 --> 01:56:15,949
I'm like a I'm like a salesman for bidets.

1373
01:56:16,149 --> 01:56:20,359
Okay, tell me so you can get you can get like a rinky-dink

1374
01:56:20,359 --> 01:56:20,960
one on Amazon.

1375
01:56:20,960 --> 01:56:21,960
It's like $30.

1376
01:56:21,960 --> 01:56:25,159
It blasts cold water at Mach 5 in your asshole.

1377
01:56:25,159 --> 01:56:26,560
And it's not comfortable.

1378
01:56:27,550 --> 01:56:29,850
I use a fancier bidet.

1379
01:56:29,850 --> 01:56:32,750
I use right now the Toto SW 2034.

1380
01:56:33,609 --> 01:56:34,010
Is that okay?

1381
01:56:34,010 --> 01:56:35,909
Is that like a AMD chip?

1382
01:56:35,909 --> 01:56:36,609
What was that?

1383
01:56:37,210 --> 01:56:39,909
This is about as expensive as a 3090.

1384
01:56:39,909 --> 01:56:41,010
All right, let's just put it that way.

1385
01:56:41,010 --> 01:56:41,510
Okay.

1386
01:56:42,789 --> 01:56:47,090
This has five different types of oscillating sprays 10

1387
01:56:47,090 --> 01:56:48,689
different pressure gauges.

1388
01:56:49,399 --> 01:56:54,739
All right, warm heated water also an air drying capability.

1389
01:56:54,739 --> 01:56:57,239
So you don't even need to use, you know, toilet paper if

1390
01:56:57,239 --> 01:57:01,640
you didn't want to comes with a deodorizer comes with white

1391
01:57:01,640 --> 01:57:02,340
noise maker.

1392
01:57:02,340 --> 01:57:03,939
So if you're if you're pooping and you don't want people

1393
01:57:03,939 --> 01:57:05,640
to know you're pooping they make it doesn't work.

1394
01:57:05,640 --> 01:57:07,640
That shit doesn't work about how loud your TV is.

1395
01:57:07,840 --> 01:57:12,479
Everyone's going to hear the like you've never you've never

1396
01:57:12,479 --> 01:57:16,189
used the Toto look it's it's just more hygienic.

1397
01:57:16,489 --> 01:57:20,789
You're you're cleaning a rug that has dirt on it with with

1398
01:57:20,789 --> 01:57:22,689
like, you know, sandpaper.

1399
01:57:22,890 --> 01:57:24,789
What kind of toilet paper are people using?

1400
01:57:25,979 --> 01:57:27,680
I'm just saying even you're using three-ply.

1401
01:57:27,680 --> 01:57:29,279
It's it's cleaning a rug with bounty.

1402
01:57:29,579 --> 01:57:31,180
That's not going to take it out of water.

1403
01:57:31,180 --> 01:57:32,380
What about the wet wipes, right?

1404
01:57:32,380 --> 01:57:36,479
What about like the wet wipes you they do not as they're

1405
01:57:36,479 --> 01:57:40,180
good, but they're not they're not as great for the environment

1406
01:57:40,180 --> 01:57:41,779
also need to keep re upping them.

1407
01:57:43,270 --> 01:57:45,170
You know that they're not always flushable.

1408
01:57:45,369 --> 01:57:47,569
Look, I understand it.

1409
01:57:47,569 --> 01:57:50,470
I will say it's it's a it's a concentrated spray.

1410
01:57:50,470 --> 01:57:51,569
It's not going to get on your legs.

1411
01:57:51,569 --> 01:57:52,670
That's absurd.

1412
01:57:53,170 --> 01:57:56,069
But isn't confined isn't your asshole wet?

1413
01:57:56,170 --> 01:57:58,869
How do you how do you go from like spraying your butt and

1414
01:57:58,869 --> 01:58:02,739
butthole with water to like now I'm putting my underwear

1415
01:58:02,739 --> 01:58:04,439
back on that always confused me.

1416
01:58:04,880 --> 01:58:08,279
So you use the bidet and then it's a it's a one wipe.

1417
01:58:08,779 --> 01:58:09,479
Here's my sales.

1418
01:58:09,479 --> 01:58:09,979
No way.

1419
01:58:09,979 --> 01:58:10,479
No way.

1420
01:58:10,479 --> 01:58:10,880
No way.

1421
01:58:10,880 --> 01:58:11,880
So I'm sorry.

1422
01:58:11,880 --> 01:58:13,479
I don't feel I that doesn't make me feel clean.

1423
01:58:14,079 --> 01:58:17,279
Let me tell you what if every poop for the rest of your

1424
01:58:17,279 --> 01:58:18,779
life was a one wiper.

1425
01:58:19,609 --> 01:58:20,210
It's impossible.

1426
01:58:21,260 --> 01:58:24,060
That's what a bidet does because I'm not normal though.

1427
01:58:24,060 --> 01:58:25,460
I have like colitis.

1428
01:58:25,460 --> 01:58:26,859
Like I don't think that would work for me.

1429
01:58:27,159 --> 01:58:28,159
It would be like messy.

1430
01:58:28,760 --> 01:58:30,859
No, it'll it will work for you.

1431
01:58:30,859 --> 01:58:31,760
Trust me.

1432
01:58:32,060 --> 01:58:32,659
Trust me.

1433
01:58:32,659 --> 01:58:33,760
Look, how about this?

1434
01:58:33,760 --> 01:58:34,359
How about this?

1435
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:36,300
I'm going to get you bidet.

1436
01:58:37,359 --> 01:58:39,460
All right, you're going to buy me a bidet.

1437
01:58:39,460 --> 01:58:40,560
I'm going to buy you bidet.

1438
01:58:40,560 --> 01:58:40,960
I'll help.

1439
01:58:40,960 --> 01:58:42,159
I'll help you set it up.

1440
01:58:42,359 --> 01:58:43,829
You can try it.

1441
01:58:44,029 --> 01:58:47,140
If you don't like it, I'll take it out of your sight.

1442
01:58:47,140 --> 01:58:47,840
I'll burn it.

1443
01:58:47,840 --> 01:58:48,439
I'll destroy it.

1444
01:58:48,439 --> 01:58:50,239
We'll have you know, that scene in the office space where

1445
01:58:50,239 --> 01:58:51,539
they destroy the fax machine.

1446
01:58:52,140 --> 01:58:54,140
Yeah, we can do that with the bidet.

1447
01:58:54,140 --> 01:58:55,739
If you don't like it, it already did.

1448
01:58:55,739 --> 01:58:57,939
I already make this joke on my stream that like me having

1449
01:58:57,939 --> 01:59:00,439
a bidet, I would do the like laugh out loud Will Ferrell

1450
01:59:00,439 --> 01:59:02,239
skit where he like needs to take a drink out of water

1451
01:59:02,239 --> 01:59:04,880
and he like takes a drink out of the bidet fountain, right?

1452
01:59:04,979 --> 01:59:06,180
Like that's a Will Ferrell thing.

1453
01:59:06,279 --> 01:59:07,880
I already make that joke.

1454
01:59:08,279 --> 01:59:09,380
You haven't made that joke yet.

1455
01:59:09,579 --> 01:59:11,250
Okay, it's up for grabs.

1456
01:59:11,350 --> 01:59:12,050
I just made it.

1457
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:15,239
Oh, sorry.

1458
01:59:15,939 --> 01:59:16,539
We can redo it.

1459
01:59:18,539 --> 01:59:18,739
All right.

1460
01:59:18,739 --> 01:59:19,539
Do you think that was funny?

1461
01:59:20,340 --> 01:59:21,140
Yeah, it was great.

1462
01:59:21,140 --> 01:59:22,939
Well, it's actually too close at home.

1463
01:59:22,939 --> 01:59:25,840
I've drank out of a bidet for $40 a couple years ago and

1464
01:59:25,840 --> 01:59:27,239
it was a big it was a big meme.

1465
01:59:27,239 --> 01:59:29,939
And then I did it again last month for $50.

1466
01:59:31,239 --> 01:59:33,539
Why are you drinking out of a bidet for $50?

1467
01:59:34,340 --> 01:59:36,340
Because 50 bucks is 50 bucks.

1468
01:59:36,340 --> 01:59:37,439
I mean you put that on a craft table.

1469
01:59:37,439 --> 01:59:38,539
You could walk out with a Rolex.

1470
01:59:38,539 --> 01:59:41,439
Why do I imagine you with like crooked sunglasses on like

1471
01:59:41,439 --> 01:59:42,340
eight drinks in?

1472
01:59:43,930 --> 01:59:46,829
Just like, yeah, man, I'll drink out of the bidet.

1473
01:59:46,829 --> 01:59:47,329
Fuck it.

1474
01:59:47,329 --> 01:59:48,630
You're gonna give me 60 bucks.

1475
01:59:49,199 --> 01:59:51,000
I'm just sitting in the bathroom and people are coming

1476
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:51,199
in.

1477
01:59:51,199 --> 01:59:52,199
I'm just harassing them.

1478
01:59:52,680 --> 01:59:55,680
Oh, you think I won't you think I won't and they're like,

1479
01:59:55,680 --> 01:59:57,680
can we get can we get a little bit out of the bathroom?

1480
01:59:57,680 --> 01:59:58,880
He's just drinking out of the bidet.

1481
01:59:58,880 --> 01:59:59,479
He's annoying.

1482
01:59:59,479 --> 02:00:01,779
He said eight drinks get a load of this guy.

1483
02:00:01,779 --> 02:00:06,189
He thinks I won't like no, and I don't want you to I keep

1484
02:00:06,189 --> 02:00:09,590
lowering the amount of money that I'll do it for 40.

1485
02:00:10,289 --> 02:00:12,390
You think I won't pay you to drink out of this bidet right

1486
02:00:12,390 --> 02:00:12,590
now.

1487
02:00:12,590 --> 02:00:13,689
You think I won't do that.

1488
02:00:14,390 --> 02:00:15,890
You just don't you put your hands on it.

1489
02:00:15,890 --> 02:00:17,890
You do a headstand and like keg stand the bidet.

1490
02:00:18,789 --> 02:00:19,989
I'm way too adept at it.

1491
02:00:19,989 --> 02:00:21,489
I'm too skilled at drinking out of it.

1492
02:00:21,489 --> 02:00:22,590
People are weirded out.

1493
02:00:24,159 --> 02:00:26,340
Yeah, that's that's that's me.

1494
02:00:26,539 --> 02:00:27,739
No, they're amazing.

1495
02:00:27,739 --> 02:00:29,239
I'm gonna I'm going to do that.

1496
02:00:29,239 --> 02:00:31,539
I've done this before for a different friend of mine.

1497
02:00:31,539 --> 02:00:33,739
You've purchased bidets for multiple people.

1498
02:00:34,579 --> 02:00:36,579
Eventually, I'm not lying to you.

1499
02:00:36,579 --> 02:00:37,279
Eventually.

1500
02:00:37,279 --> 02:00:41,079
My goal is to create my own bidets and sell them.

1501
02:00:41,279 --> 02:00:43,779
Jesus, did you really want me to play World of Warcraft?

1502
02:00:46,880 --> 02:00:48,979
That's like the I need to get my friend to play World of

1503
02:00:48,979 --> 02:00:49,279
Warcraft.

1504
02:00:49,279 --> 02:00:50,479
Hey, I'll buy for the first month, man.

1505
02:00:51,180 --> 02:00:51,880
I'll push you up.

1506
02:00:51,979 --> 02:00:52,579
You need items.

1507
02:00:52,779 --> 02:00:54,180
Oh, let me tell you the lore of this place.

1508
02:00:54,720 --> 02:00:57,720
This gets me no there's no this is a selfless endeavor.

1509
02:00:57,720 --> 02:00:59,819
Oh well until I sell them then that's a selfish endeavor.

1510
02:00:59,819 --> 02:01:02,319
But for now, it's a selfless endeavor because I just think

1511
02:01:02,319 --> 02:01:04,119
it's such a great product.

1512
02:01:04,119 --> 02:01:05,819
You know, it's World of Warcraft because I'm trying to play

1513
02:01:05,819 --> 02:01:06,720
with you this.

1514
02:01:06,720 --> 02:01:09,020
I don't know what happens when you shit germ.

1515
02:01:09,020 --> 02:01:11,020
I've never I've never thought about it till today.

1516
02:01:12,329 --> 02:01:15,029
You just want me to have a much better experience.

1517
02:01:15,529 --> 02:01:19,329
Yeah, I want you to feel about shitting how I do which is

1518
02:01:19,329 --> 02:01:22,029
it's like a it's like a good experience pleasurable not well,

1519
02:01:22,029 --> 02:01:24,029
that's not it's not pleasure, but it's a good experience.

1520
02:01:24,029 --> 02:01:26,899
It's like a it's a good experience.

1521
02:01:26,899 --> 02:01:28,199
It feels good experience.

1522
02:01:28,199 --> 02:01:30,100
It's a positive experience is what I was looking for.

1523
02:01:30,560 --> 02:01:35,449
Okay, is it before we move on one final question does the

1524
02:01:35,449 --> 02:01:42,630
water hit you in the bag of you know what I'm saying?

1525
02:01:46,500 --> 02:01:50,199
I imagine I imagine like really cold water hitting me right

1526
02:01:50,199 --> 02:01:54,300
in the balls and it's like, oh, okay.

1527
02:01:54,300 --> 02:01:54,699
All right.

1528
02:01:54,699 --> 02:01:59,819
Well, look there there is much like a car seat when you get

1529
02:01:59,819 --> 02:02:02,520
in for the first time maybe you're a little too far up and

1530
02:02:02,520 --> 02:02:03,420
you need to crank it back.

1531
02:02:03,420 --> 02:02:06,420
But after you've done it, you should be fine unless you sit

1532
02:02:06,720 --> 02:02:10,119
in obtuse ways every time you get on the toilet, I said like

1533
02:02:10,119 --> 02:02:11,020
you get your mode.

1534
02:02:11,319 --> 02:02:11,720
You're good.

1535
02:02:11,720 --> 02:02:13,319
I said this is how I sit on the toilet.

1536
02:02:13,319 --> 02:02:15,760
You should have like a phone is usually like this.

1537
02:02:18,380 --> 02:02:18,979
I'm watching.

1538
02:02:19,970 --> 02:02:20,869
Yeah, that's that's fine.

1539
02:02:20,869 --> 02:02:22,069
That seems standard.

1540
02:02:22,170 --> 02:02:23,170
It seems like a standard.

1541
02:02:24,119 --> 02:02:26,720
Okay, that's oddly 45 degree.

1542
02:02:26,720 --> 02:02:27,420
It's still fine.

1543
02:02:27,420 --> 02:02:29,890
It's just you know, yeah, it's fine.

1544
02:02:29,890 --> 02:02:30,789
That's that's fine.

1545
02:02:30,789 --> 02:02:32,590
Do you have long balls or something?

1546
02:02:32,789 --> 02:02:37,090
Yes, I was okay.

1547
02:02:37,390 --> 02:02:37,890
Sorry.

1548
02:02:41,239 --> 02:02:42,239
Look, I'll tell you this.

1549
02:02:42,239 --> 02:02:44,640
It's it's not cold water as well as heated water.

1550
02:02:44,640 --> 02:02:46,239
Yeah, but you saw this different kinds.

1551
02:02:46,239 --> 02:02:48,439
Are you going to buy me like the all right?

1552
02:02:48,439 --> 02:02:51,340
Are you going to get me the Cadillac or are you going to

1553
02:02:51,340 --> 02:02:53,939
get me like the the used car?

1554
02:02:53,939 --> 02:02:55,939
I like I'm getting you the Ferrari.

1555
02:02:57,529 --> 02:02:59,029
Okay, walk into your bathroom.

1556
02:02:59,029 --> 02:03:01,630
You're going to think you walked into a SpaceX ship.

1557
02:03:01,630 --> 02:03:02,930
It's going to make noises.

1558
02:03:03,859 --> 02:03:05,659
It's gonna have like blue light emanating from it.

1559
02:03:05,659 --> 02:03:06,560
It's going to be amazing.

1560
02:03:08,779 --> 02:03:09,380
Sign me up.

1561
02:03:09,380 --> 02:03:09,880
I'll dumb.

1562
02:03:09,880 --> 02:03:10,380
I'm down.

1563
02:03:10,989 --> 02:03:12,689
Yeah, I'll get it for you.

1564
02:03:12,689 --> 02:03:12,989
All right.

1565
02:03:12,989 --> 02:03:16,090
Do you want like a like a like a live reaction like after

1566
02:03:16,090 --> 02:03:18,189
I come out of the bathroom like let me tell you about it.

1567
02:03:18,189 --> 02:03:20,189
Like is that what you want to like tell you exactly like

1568
02:03:20,189 --> 02:03:21,090
right after I use it.

1569
02:03:21,560 --> 02:03:24,460
I don't need to be gratified immediately.

1570
02:03:24,560 --> 02:03:28,939
I think I'm so confident in a bidet as a as a as a thing

1571
02:03:28,939 --> 02:03:32,939
as a product as an invention that I know long-term.

1572
02:03:32,939 --> 02:03:33,539
You'll love it.

1573
02:03:33,840 --> 02:03:35,989
Okay, I'm game.

1574
02:03:37,210 --> 02:03:38,609

Give me a shot.

1576
02:03:39,409 --> 02:03:41,909
We'll go buy a bidet next time.

1577
02:03:41,909 --> 02:03:44,010
I'll I'm going to fly with it.

1578
02:03:44,380 --> 02:03:46,979
I'm going to travel with a bidet.

1579
02:03:47,079 --> 02:03:47,880
I'm going to travel.

1580
02:03:47,880 --> 02:03:49,380
I've done this before you laughing.

1581
02:03:49,380 --> 02:03:50,180
I've done this.

1582
02:03:50,579 --> 02:03:54,380
I went to Texas to deliver to deliver to deliver my friend

1583
02:03:54,380 --> 02:03:58,859
J slot a bidet and I set it up for him.

1584
02:03:58,960 --> 02:04:01,359
Do you have to check that is that like are you carry like

1585
02:04:01,359 --> 02:04:02,460
in a backpack and put it?

1586
02:04:02,460 --> 02:04:03,359
I had to check that.

1587
02:04:03,560 --> 02:04:06,359
Yeah, I had to check that they were had to hide the whole

1588
02:04:06,359 --> 02:04:07,060
conversation.

1589
02:04:07,060 --> 02:04:09,859
They waited they put it in put the little ticker on it.

1590
02:04:10,060 --> 02:04:13,060
Why am I imagining you setting the bidet up in the airplane

1591
02:04:13,060 --> 02:04:15,930
bathroom because you like it and you want one in there.

1592
02:04:17,159 --> 02:04:19,260
Yeah, I just have like an extra everywhere.

1593
02:04:19,260 --> 02:04:19,659
I go.

1594
02:04:19,659 --> 02:04:21,859
That's just like a quick place just in case.

1595
02:04:21,859 --> 02:04:23,960
Yeah, you got you got to set it up and you have to use it

1596
02:04:23,960 --> 02:04:24,260
there.

1597
02:04:24,829 --> 02:04:27,329
Do you do you know the movie Pursuit of Happiness with

1598
02:04:27,329 --> 02:04:27,930
Will Ferrell?

1599
02:04:29,300 --> 02:04:29,800
Well, you did well.

1600
02:04:29,800 --> 02:04:31,399
Wait, did Will Ferrell did this in a movie?

1601
02:04:31,399 --> 02:04:33,500
That's what will Smith will Smith.

1602
02:04:33,500 --> 02:04:33,800
Oh shit.

1603
02:04:33,800 --> 02:04:36,000
I thought you guys tell me Will Ferrell put a bidet in an

1604
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:37,399
airplane bathroom and had a drink.

1605
02:04:37,880 --> 02:04:38,380
No, no, no.

1606
02:04:38,380 --> 02:04:40,479
I'm talking about Pursuit of Happiness with Will Smith,

1607
02:04:40,779 --> 02:04:44,319
you know where he buys all these medical equipment and

1608
02:04:44,319 --> 02:04:46,220
he has to he has to like sell them.

1609
02:04:46,420 --> 02:04:49,060
You know that movie I think I've heard of it.

1610
02:04:49,979 --> 02:04:52,880
Basically he goes into debt because he buys all these

1611
02:04:52,880 --> 02:04:55,380
medical equipment and he has to go door to door to every

1612
02:04:55,380 --> 02:04:56,479
hospital to sell them.

1613
02:04:56,680 --> 02:04:57,779
That's me with bidets.

1614
02:04:57,779 --> 02:05:01,579
Like I put my net worth into this product and now I'm just

1615
02:05:01,579 --> 02:05:04,859
desperately trying to sell them just going door to door

1616
02:05:04,859 --> 02:05:05,859
trying to get people.

1617
02:05:06,560 --> 02:05:08,060
People got to buy these bidets.

1618
02:05:08,460 --> 02:05:08,859
Yeah.

1619
02:05:08,859 --> 02:05:10,960
It's got so many of them bidets.

1620
02:05:11,500 --> 02:05:13,899
Yeah, just it's it's like floor to ceiling.

1621
02:05:14,199 --> 02:05:15,300
My girlfriend's pissed.

1622
02:05:15,300 --> 02:05:17,300
She can barely walk into the bedroom because there's so

1623
02:05:17,300 --> 02:05:18,100
many bidets.

1624
02:05:18,640 --> 02:05:21,039
Hey, I just have a long-term strategy long-term strategy.

1625
02:05:21,039 --> 02:05:23,520
You'll make 10% on each one.

1626
02:05:23,960 --> 02:05:25,760
We're going to make 10x if you just wait.

1627
02:05:25,760 --> 02:05:26,159
All right.

1628
02:05:26,159 --> 02:05:26,560
Yeah.

1629
02:05:26,560 --> 02:05:26,960
For now.

1630
02:05:26,960 --> 02:05:30,159
We have bidets everywhere around the house, but soon we'll

1631
02:05:30,159 --> 02:05:34,760
just have millions in an entire country adapted to the world

1632
02:05:34,760 --> 02:05:35,359
of bidets.

1633
02:05:35,659 --> 02:05:39,399
Put them on every sink instead of a brita.

1634
02:05:39,399 --> 02:05:43,359
It's just a bidet that you can drink from that's fucking

1635
02:05:43,359 --> 02:05:44,960
gross, but it's not even it's just like a piece of metal

1636
02:05:44,960 --> 02:05:46,460
that shoots water like you can shoot in your mouth.

1637
02:05:46,460 --> 02:05:47,359
It's not gross at all.

1638
02:05:47,659 --> 02:05:48,060
Whatever.

1639
02:05:48,500 --> 02:05:52,199
It's 0% gross because it doesn't you know, I mean the first

1640
02:05:52,199 --> 02:05:54,600
you can drinking out of a bidet on the first spray.

1641
02:05:54,600 --> 02:05:55,800
That's that's anything.

1642
02:05:55,800 --> 02:05:59,880
It's more hygienic, you know, 50 sprays in we got some problems.

1643
02:05:59,880 --> 02:06:00,479
I'm telling you.

1644
02:06:00,479 --> 02:06:01,579
I'm telling you after day one.

1645
02:06:01,579 --> 02:06:03,579
I ain't not drinking out of a bidet.

1646
02:06:04,079 --> 02:06:04,979
Not doing that.

1647
02:06:04,979 --> 02:06:05,479
That's fair.

1648
02:06:05,479 --> 02:06:08,380
But day zero you'd be like, yeah, it's just you know, okay.

1649
02:06:08,380 --> 02:06:10,779
I don't want to stay on bidet for a million years, but I

1650
02:06:10,779 --> 02:06:11,680
have another question.

1651
02:06:12,079 --> 02:06:12,680
Yeah, please.

1652
02:06:12,680 --> 02:06:13,479
Oh fuck.

1653
02:06:13,479 --> 02:06:13,880
All right.

1654
02:06:16,180 --> 02:06:17,880
Where is the nozzle?

1655
02:06:17,880 --> 02:06:19,380
Do you like shit on the nozzle?

1656
02:06:19,380 --> 02:06:20,180
Like where is it not?

1657
02:06:20,180 --> 02:06:20,680
Where's the point?

1658
02:06:20,680 --> 02:06:23,779
How is it pointed angle to not get like pissed and pooped on?

1659
02:06:24,279 --> 02:06:27,729
There are two nozzles and they retract.

1660
02:06:27,829 --> 02:06:30,130
I mean they were like like landing gear in a plane.

1661
02:06:30,430 --> 02:06:32,430
Yeah, exactly like a landing gear in a plane.

1662
02:06:32,430 --> 02:06:34,430
You can literally see it retract.

1663
02:06:35,600 --> 02:06:40,800
What yeah, it goes into itself and then to clean itself.

1664
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:43,800
It will spray where it retracts to think of it as like an

1665
02:06:43,800 --> 02:06:47,899
enclosure and it'll just ricochet off of like its enclosure

1666
02:06:47,899 --> 02:06:48,899
to clean itself.

1667
02:06:51,039 --> 02:06:55,260
What this is I'm telling you the technology exists.

1668
02:06:55,260 --> 02:06:56,659
You just don't know about it yet.

1669
02:06:58,659 --> 02:06:59,659
I don't know man.

1670
02:06:59,659 --> 02:07:01,659
This is I know this is freaking me out, but I'll try it.

1671
02:07:01,659 --> 02:07:02,159
I'll do it.

1672
02:07:03,380 --> 02:07:03,979
You'll do it.

1673
02:07:03,979 --> 02:07:04,880
It'll be great.

1674
02:07:05,590 --> 02:07:06,590
I'm looking forward to it.

1675
02:07:06,689 --> 02:07:07,289
Let's do it.

1676
02:07:09,119 --> 02:07:10,420

Yeah, definitely a pre-recorded.

1682
02:07:18,619 --> 02:07:20,520
Yeah, definitely need some editing.

1683
02:07:24,890 --> 02:07:25,189
All right.

1684
02:07:25,189 --> 02:07:26,789
What what's what's the wager here?

1685
02:07:26,789 --> 02:07:27,789
What's the wager here?

1686
02:07:27,789 --> 02:07:28,489
I don't know.

1687
02:07:28,489 --> 02:07:28,890
All right.

You are you still having fun with Battleship?

1692
02:07:38,220 --> 02:07:39,020
I'm feeling phenomenal.

1693
02:07:39,020 --> 02:07:40,520
I'm happy to switch gears at any time.

1694
02:07:40,520 --> 02:07:41,920
I'm so easy.

1695
02:07:41,920 --> 02:07:42,420
I'm easy.

1696
02:07:42,720 --> 02:07:45,819
Okay, there apparently is like an advanced super mode.

1697
02:07:46,479 --> 02:07:47,979
We're playing want to try that right now.

1698
02:07:48,279 --> 02:07:49,479
You want to try the advanced mode?

1699
02:07:49,880 --> 02:07:51,079
I'm happy to try the advanced mode.

1700
02:07:51,079 --> 02:07:51,779
I did see that.

1701
02:07:51,779 --> 02:07:52,380
I didn't know what it meant.

1702
02:07:52,380 --> 02:07:54,079
I don't know things.

1703
02:07:54,079 --> 02:07:54,880
I'm scared of them.

1704
02:07:54,880 --> 02:07:55,880
How about we speed run this one?

1705
02:07:55,880 --> 02:07:57,180
Let's do one speed run round.

1706
02:07:57,880 --> 02:08:00,180
Well, you cannot you cannot take more than two seconds to

1707
02:08:00,180 --> 02:08:00,979
click on a space.

1708
02:08:01,720 --> 02:08:02,119
All right.

1709
02:08:02,119 --> 02:08:02,520
All right.

1710
02:08:02,520 --> 02:08:06,800
How about how about also every ship has to connect in some

1711
02:08:06,800 --> 02:08:07,199
manner?

1712
02:08:07,300 --> 02:08:07,600
Sure.

1713
02:08:08,659 --> 02:08:08,859
All right.

1714
02:08:08,859 --> 02:08:10,960
Every ship has to connect and you have to take you can

1715
02:08:10,960 --> 02:08:12,560
now take more than two seconds to click.

1716
02:08:13,260 --> 02:08:14,359
Corner connecting is fine.

1717
02:08:14,560 --> 02:08:25,000
Okay, that should be good.

1718
02:08:30,340 --> 02:08:30,739
Shit.

1719
02:08:30,739 --> 02:08:31,039
I don't know.

1720
02:08:31,039 --> 02:08:32,840
This is like way more complicated than I thought it was.

1721
02:08:33,340 --> 02:08:37,579
Yeah, I find myself struggling a bit here.

1722
02:08:38,579 --> 02:08:40,079
It's actually a pretty good lineup.

1723
02:08:43,319 --> 02:08:44,619
No, I'm not going to do F again.

1724
02:08:45,020 --> 02:08:45,720
Why would I do that?

1725
02:08:47,390 --> 02:08:49,789
I think this is I think I think you might be mind-tricking

1726
02:08:49,789 --> 02:08:50,189
me here.

1727
02:08:51,989 --> 02:08:53,390
No, I was I was just doing it.

1728
02:08:53,390 --> 02:08:54,890
I was just moving ships around to make it enough.

1729
02:08:55,189 --> 02:09:00,159
What a terrible design.

1730
02:09:03,119 --> 02:09:05,020
But the design was so much better than this.

1731
02:09:10,220 --> 02:09:11,720
Why does it look so fucking wrong?

1732
02:09:16,270 --> 02:09:22,430
Is this supposed to look wrong?

1733
02:09:22,430 --> 02:09:23,829
It's just it's not bad.

1734
02:09:23,829 --> 02:09:25,029
How does it can't look wrong?

1735
02:09:25,029 --> 02:09:27,430
You can't do battleship wrong.

1736
02:09:27,529 --> 02:09:29,529
No, but I'm trying to be I'm connecting them wrong.

1737
02:09:32,649 --> 02:09:33,550
Adam already.

1738
02:09:34,840 --> 02:09:42,819
Oh, two seconds.

1739
02:09:43,520 --> 02:09:44,020
Oh shit.

1740
02:09:44,020 --> 02:09:44,420
Shit.

1741
02:09:45,840 --> 02:09:46,640
Oh my God.

1742
02:09:53,489 --> 02:09:54,890
What how are you not going down?

1743
02:09:56,199 --> 02:09:57,300
Oh, we didn't even bet anything.

1744
02:09:57,300 --> 02:09:58,100
We didn't bet anything.

1745
02:09:58,500 --> 02:10:00,399
Oh, yeah, we just said speed around so we could get to

1746
02:10:00,399 --> 02:10:00,899
the other thing.

1747
02:10:00,899 --> 02:10:01,399
That's right.

1748
02:10:01,899 --> 02:10:09,369
Let's just do a very casual very breezy one gifted sub.

1749
02:10:09,670 --> 02:10:15,359
Okay left.

1750
02:10:15,359 --> 02:10:16,659
Oh song.

1751
02:10:17,239 --> 02:10:17,439
All right.

1752
02:10:17,439 --> 02:10:22,789
So it has to connect in some way which that makes this game

1753
02:10:22,789 --> 02:10:23,390
somewhat easy.

1754
02:10:23,390 --> 02:10:24,890
Corners can connect to right?

1755
02:10:25,289 --> 02:10:25,590
Yeah.

1756
02:10:25,590 --> 02:10:33,979
Corners connects is nothing on the line.

1757
02:10:33,979 --> 02:10:35,579
You're going to win this miss clicked.

1758
02:10:35,680 --> 02:10:36,779
I literally miss clicked.

1759
02:10:38,289 --> 02:10:39,789
I don't actually think I win this one.

1760
02:10:39,789 --> 02:10:40,390
I think you do.

1761
02:10:42,859 --> 02:10:44,260
Give me that's all about sub.

1762
02:10:45,989 --> 02:10:46,989
How it's connected.

1763
02:10:48,390 --> 02:10:51,390
I actually would feel bad for you if you won this because

1764
02:10:51,390 --> 02:10:54,890
you just be winning all the low stakes matches for $80.

1765
02:10:56,109 --> 02:10:57,609
At least I got to participate.

1766
02:10:57,710 --> 02:10:58,210
It was fun.

1767
02:10:58,210 --> 02:10:58,609
Yeah.

1768
02:11:00,789 --> 02:11:02,390
Oh, you went corner.

1769
02:11:02,689 --> 02:11:02,989
You did.

1770
02:11:02,989 --> 02:11:03,989
I did go corner.

1771
02:11:04,090 --> 02:11:06,479
Well, I want a bit corner.

1772
02:11:08,300 --> 02:11:09,500
You went adjacent.

1773
02:11:09,600 --> 02:11:10,100
You did.

1774
02:11:16,319 --> 02:11:18,460
Oh, no, this is your destroyer.

1775
02:11:20,770 --> 02:11:21,170
Okay.

1776
02:11:21,270 --> 02:11:21,670
All right.

1777
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:24,399
How would you have connected this?

1778
02:11:24,399 --> 02:11:25,199
I think a corner.

1779
02:11:26,170 --> 02:11:26,770
There we are.

1780
02:11:31,100 --> 02:11:33,699
Oh, you just made it like the letter I.

1781
02:11:35,359 --> 02:11:39,489
Hey, I think you might have made a perfect letter.

1782
02:11:39,489 --> 02:11:42,739
I what did you do though?

1783
02:11:44,279 --> 02:11:46,779
I went for a more refined strategy.

1784
02:11:46,880 --> 02:11:48,680
This is this seems pretty refined.

1785
02:11:49,800 --> 02:11:53,100
I wasn't thinking the letter L or anything.

1786
02:11:53,100 --> 02:11:53,399
Oh shit.

1787
02:11:53,399 --> 02:11:54,000
You didn't do that.

1788
02:11:54,000 --> 02:12:03,359
Okay, so must be here for now.

1789
02:12:03,359 --> 02:12:04,960
The question is you have a what?

1790
02:12:05,460 --> 02:12:06,359
Oh, no.

1791
02:12:08,699 --> 02:12:10,100
Oh, no.

1792
02:12:11,170 --> 02:12:12,069
Wait, okay.

1793
02:12:12,470 --> 02:12:14,270
Is it continued down here?

1794
02:12:15,260 --> 02:12:16,260
It is it's a letter.

1795
02:12:16,260 --> 02:12:17,159
I it's the letter.

1796
02:12:17,159 --> 02:12:19,560
I you just made the letter letter J.

1797
02:12:19,560 --> 02:12:20,460
I just did it wrong.

1798
02:12:20,960 --> 02:12:23,359
Wait, you didn't do the letter J.

1799
02:12:23,359 --> 02:12:25,159
If you that's supposed to be the letter J.

1800
02:12:25,800 --> 02:12:26,300
Right.

1801
02:12:26,399 --> 02:12:27,399
All right for Jerma.

1802
02:12:27,500 --> 02:12:27,899
Mm-hmm.

1803
02:12:29,079 --> 02:12:33,380
Now we're going to refine that is I went for at first.

1804
02:12:33,380 --> 02:12:36,380
I just did a really like a cross and I was like, no, I've done this.

1805
02:12:37,439 --> 02:12:37,640
All right.

1806
02:12:37,640 --> 02:12:39,340
Well, it was it was low stakes.

1807
02:12:39,340 --> 02:12:40,739
It was it was just a gifted.

1808
02:12:40,739 --> 02:12:41,340
So that's fine.

1809
02:12:41,340 --> 02:12:42,239
It's just a gifted.

1810
02:12:42,239 --> 02:12:42,739
It's all right.

1811
02:12:42,739 --> 02:12:46,710
And on top of the hundred hundred and one gifted subs actually 96.

1812
02:12:46,710 --> 02:12:48,310
I owe you five from our side bet.

1813
02:12:48,310 --> 02:12:49,109
Oh, that's right.

1814
02:12:50,300 --> 02:12:52,000
Okay, I'm going to create one.

1815
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:53,399
It says commanders.

1816
02:12:53,699 --> 02:12:54,500
Whoa.

1817
02:12:54,500 --> 02:12:56,659
Yeah, this is I can hold this another game mode.

1818
02:12:56,859 --> 02:12:58,960
He there's like different maps.

1819
02:13:00,909 --> 02:13:01,909
Let's do one of the wacky ones.

1820
02:13:02,380 --> 02:13:05,180
Yeah, we're going to play at.

1821
02:13:05,479 --> 02:13:10,689
Oh, I can I can purchase this we can play at going to buy it.

1822
02:13:11,319 --> 02:13:14,420
Yeah, I'm going to buy I can buy the White Cliffs of Dover or the

1823
02:13:14,420 --> 02:13:17,949
Colossus Bay Colossus Bay.

1824
02:13:18,420 --> 02:13:25,510
Yeah, that's I think sounds somebody keeps saying don't bet on Jerma.

1825
02:13:25,510 --> 02:13:26,109
He sucks.

1826
02:13:27,359 --> 02:13:30,260
Well, I mean, look, you sometimes get into a streak and I was on

1827
02:13:30,260 --> 02:13:32,460
a winning streak in the beginning and now he's on a winning streak.

1828
02:13:33,119 --> 02:13:36,720
You were hot for a minute, but it can come back.

1829
02:13:38,689 --> 02:13:39,189
Okay.

1830
02:13:39,489 --> 02:13:39,689
All right.

1831
02:13:39,689 --> 02:13:41,689
You got a code sending you the code.

1832
02:13:42,289 --> 02:13:43,789
So I opened up our discord.

1833
02:13:43,789 --> 02:13:44,489
This is your ass.

1834
02:13:45,390 --> 02:13:45,890
Yeah.

1835
02:13:46,090 --> 02:13:46,289
Yeah.

1836
02:13:46,289 --> 02:13:47,390
Might be we didn't clear that.

1837
02:13:47,390 --> 02:13:49,289
It's just it's just written on your ass.

1838
02:13:50,710 --> 02:13:51,909
So here's the thing.

1839
02:13:52,699 --> 02:13:56,699
The boats are not all shaped like boats in this one.

1840
02:13:56,899 --> 02:13:59,079
Wait, what are you seeing this?

1841
02:13:59,079 --> 02:13:59,680
Yeah, this is weird.

1842
02:14:00,180 --> 02:14:01,180
I think you can show now.

1843
02:14:02,770 --> 02:14:06,729
But yeah, they're not all like well, this is weird.

1844
02:14:06,729 --> 02:14:07,529
This is different.

1845
02:14:07,529 --> 02:14:09,130
This is like a different arena too.

1846
02:14:09,640 --> 02:14:12,039
Do you think there are advantages for different commanders?

1847
02:14:12,039 --> 02:14:17,479
Should we do a Clone War here or torpedo airstrike bombardment

1848
02:14:17,880 --> 02:14:20,380
projectiles surgical strike?

1849
02:14:21,239 --> 02:14:22,439
So what does this mean?

1850
02:14:22,810 --> 02:14:23,909
I don't know what salvo means.

1851
02:14:23,909 --> 02:14:25,109
I've never even heard of that.

1852
02:14:25,409 --> 02:14:29,310
Salvo is like a four or five like six like kind of spread out

1853
02:14:29,310 --> 02:14:31,050
shooting a missile, huh?

1854
02:14:32,640 --> 02:14:33,739
I'm going to try this.

1855
02:14:33,739 --> 02:14:35,909
I think we have nearly the same shifts.

1856
02:14:35,909 --> 02:14:37,310
We'll have to remember the shapes here.

1857
02:14:37,510 --> 02:14:38,710
Yours seems really bad though.

1858
02:14:38,710 --> 02:14:39,409
I'm not going to lie.

1859
02:14:39,409 --> 02:14:40,210
Are you happy with that?

1860
02:14:40,210 --> 02:14:41,710
He's oh, maybe not.

1861
02:14:42,109 --> 02:14:42,909
Look at the far right.

1862
02:14:42,909 --> 02:14:49,060
It's just a giant for yeah, this is I'm happier with this guy,

1863
02:14:49,060 --> 02:14:50,659
but he's got but maybe he has a better I'm going to go with

1864
02:14:50,659 --> 02:14:51,760
this guy because he got torpedo.

1865
02:14:52,300 --> 02:14:52,600
All right.

1866
02:14:52,600 --> 02:14:52,899
All right.

1867
02:14:52,899 --> 02:14:54,399
I'm going to go with Sir Philip Wade.

1868
02:14:54,399 --> 02:14:56,399
He's doing well pay to win.

1869
02:14:57,000 --> 02:14:58,100
This is pay to win now.

1870
02:14:59,300 --> 02:14:59,500
Shit.

1871
02:14:59,500 --> 02:15:07,310
Do I have to buy these abilities mine sonar bomb torpedo?

1872
02:15:10,130 --> 02:15:13,529
What I'm seeing is that it's almost like set up to make me

1873
02:15:13,529 --> 02:15:18,359
put these really beautifully in the corners to get that urge.

1874
02:15:18,359 --> 02:15:20,159
I do have this urge to kind of Tetris this.

1875
02:15:20,640 --> 02:15:31,779
Yeah, and it's the worst idea possible.

1876
02:15:31,979 --> 02:15:32,779
I'm happy with that.

1877
02:15:34,239 --> 02:15:40,729
I almost think it's what if I do something like this would

1878
02:15:40,729 --> 02:15:41,729
be a little silly, huh?

1879
02:15:46,170 --> 02:15:46,869
I'm happy with this.

1880
02:15:47,550 --> 02:15:51,350
I feel good about where I'm at.

1881
02:15:53,779 --> 02:15:56,180
So when do we what decides if we get to use our abilities?

1882
02:15:56,579 --> 02:16:00,180
I have no idea how any of it works, but I guess we'll see

1883
02:16:00,279 --> 02:16:01,180
I'm starting us off.

1884
02:16:01,180 --> 02:16:01,779
Well, what's our bet?

1885
02:16:01,779 --> 02:16:02,380
What's our wager?

1886
02:16:03,079 --> 02:16:03,680
Another tweet.

1887
02:16:04,439 --> 02:16:04,739
Okay.

1888
02:16:04,739 --> 02:16:06,039
Oh, whoa.

1889
02:16:06,829 --> 02:16:08,729
Is this a double or nothing in the sense that your your

1890
02:16:08,729 --> 02:16:12,470
other tweets like gone or how do you know just just just

1891
02:16:12,470 --> 02:16:13,270
for another one?

1892
02:16:13,569 --> 02:16:14,369
Just a second tweet.

1893
02:16:14,369 --> 02:16:14,670
Okay.

1894
02:16:14,770 --> 02:16:15,069
All right.

1895
02:16:15,069 --> 02:16:16,270
Interesting interesting.

1896
02:16:17,500 --> 02:16:18,800
This is this is weird.

1897
02:16:19,470 --> 02:16:19,770
All right.

1898
02:16:19,770 --> 02:16:21,770
I have a single shot.

1899
02:16:21,770 --> 02:16:23,270
I got two lightning bolts.

1900
02:16:24,390 --> 02:16:25,489
You got two lightning bolts.

1901
02:16:26,630 --> 02:16:27,430
What is going on?

1902
02:16:27,829 --> 02:16:28,130
I don't know.

1903
02:16:28,130 --> 02:16:30,010
There's like a there's like abilities.

1904
02:16:30,010 --> 02:16:31,310
I don't know what's going on here.

1905
02:16:32,040 --> 02:16:37,079
It gave me two lightning when I what did I do just

1906
02:16:37,079 --> 02:16:37,879
dropped a mine.

1907
02:16:38,940 --> 02:16:39,840
What does that do?

1908
02:16:39,840 --> 02:16:40,340
I don't know.

1909
02:16:41,389 --> 02:16:43,190
Maybe if I click on it, it hurts me.

1910
02:16:43,659 --> 02:16:44,760
Do you know where my mind is?

1911
02:16:45,239 --> 02:16:46,040
No, I have no idea.

1912
02:16:47,030 --> 02:16:47,430
Okay.

1913
02:16:47,530 --> 02:16:48,129
I was going to shoot it.

1914
02:16:48,129 --> 02:16:49,329
That would have been a giveaway.

1915
02:16:51,530 --> 02:16:52,430
I thought that was a mine.

1916
02:16:52,430 --> 02:16:52,829
Okay.

1917
02:16:53,469 --> 02:16:53,870
No, no, no.

1918
02:16:53,870 --> 02:16:55,670
I put my mind somewhere.

1919
02:16:56,069 --> 02:16:58,870
I guess you get like ability points per turn.

1920
02:16:58,870 --> 02:16:59,670
Oh, all right.

1921
02:17:00,340 --> 02:17:00,840
I get it.

1922
02:17:04,770 --> 02:17:05,870
Oh, it shows you the pieces.

1923
02:17:08,559 --> 02:17:09,159
Oh, I get it.

1924
02:17:09,159 --> 02:17:09,360
Okay.

1925
02:17:09,360 --> 02:17:09,559
Yeah.

1926
02:17:09,559 --> 02:17:09,860
Yeah.

1927
02:17:11,420 --> 02:17:16,049
And I play some mine, but I can also just not do anything

1928
02:17:16,049 --> 02:17:17,250
and I think I save.

1929
02:17:17,250 --> 02:17:19,879
Oh, did you tuck it in?

1930
02:17:20,079 --> 02:17:21,680
Wait, that gave me a lightning bolt.

1931
02:17:21,680 --> 02:17:25,090
By the way, if you can still afford some abilities, you

1932
02:17:25,090 --> 02:17:26,389
can choose to save him.

1933
02:17:26,690 --> 02:17:28,190
I'm going to save my mind.

1934
02:17:28,870 --> 02:17:31,069
Wait, I should mine where my ship is, right?

1935
02:17:33,559 --> 02:17:34,459
Presumably.

1936
02:17:38,899 --> 02:17:39,500
You know what?

1937
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:41,899
Oh, whoa.

1938
02:17:42,200 --> 02:17:46,000
What you bombs away and I didn't do anything.

1939
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:47,700
This you don't have anything in the side.

1940
02:17:47,899 --> 02:17:48,799
It was a whiff.

1941
02:17:49,100 --> 02:17:50,500
No, not to say I have nothing over there.

1942
02:17:50,500 --> 02:17:52,700
You should you should keep your forces.

1943
02:17:52,899 --> 02:17:54,000
Keep your forces on the left.

1944
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:55,399
You just missed you're close.

1945
02:17:59,840 --> 02:18:00,440
All right.

1946
02:18:00,440 --> 02:18:02,040
I reverse psychology you.

1947
02:18:02,040 --> 02:18:02,440
All right.

1948
02:18:02,440 --> 02:18:02,840
All right.

1949
02:18:02,840 --> 02:18:03,440
So where is it?

1950
02:18:03,440 --> 02:18:05,440
Where is this fucking scumbag?

1951
02:18:08,100 --> 02:18:08,600
Okay.

1952
02:18:12,139 --> 02:18:13,639
So I have so many points.

1953
02:18:13,639 --> 02:18:14,440
What does this do?

1954
02:18:14,979 --> 02:18:16,379
Oh, you used five point.

1955
02:18:16,379 --> 02:18:20,860
I'm going to save up for my my maximum surely you went to

1956
02:18:20,860 --> 02:18:21,459
the right here.

1957
02:18:21,459 --> 02:18:24,899
Like you do know damn it.

1958
02:18:27,170 --> 02:18:27,370
All right.

1959
02:18:27,370 --> 02:18:30,370
So I have to be careful because now you have like a super bomb

1960
02:18:30,370 --> 02:18:30,870
now, don't you?

1961
02:18:30,870 --> 02:18:32,469
Whatever your like ultimate ability is.

1962
02:18:32,670 --> 02:18:34,069
Yeah, I don't know what it is.

1963
02:18:34,069 --> 02:18:36,370
It's my salvo or whatever.

1964
02:18:36,850 --> 02:18:38,450
What are you feeding me right now?

1965
02:18:39,879 --> 02:18:40,680
I have a few.

1966
02:18:40,680 --> 02:18:40,979
Okay.

1967
02:18:40,979 --> 02:18:43,000
You have this still.

1968
02:18:43,200 --> 02:18:43,799
Oh my God.

1969
02:18:43,799 --> 02:18:44,399
How did you know?

1970
02:18:44,399 --> 02:18:45,299
I just figured it would be.

1971
02:18:45,299 --> 02:18:46,399
Oh wait, that's not even that one.

1972
02:18:46,500 --> 02:18:47,000
Which one is this?

1973
02:18:47,000 --> 02:18:47,700
No, it's not.

1974
02:18:47,700 --> 02:18:48,600
It's it's the other one.

1975
02:18:49,459 --> 02:18:49,760
What?

1976
02:18:50,260 --> 02:18:51,059
Oh, all right.

1977
02:18:51,059 --> 02:18:51,459
All right.

1978
02:18:51,459 --> 02:18:51,860
All right.

1979
02:18:52,590 --> 02:18:52,790
All right.

1980
02:18:52,790 --> 02:18:53,889
That's that's big for me.

1981
02:18:55,930 --> 02:18:56,430
Okay.

1982
02:18:56,430 --> 02:18:59,430
So you're you're just presumably wait, what does this do?

1983
02:19:02,850 --> 02:19:03,850
Does it just shoot?

1984
02:19:05,159 --> 02:19:05,559
Hold up.

1985
02:19:05,559 --> 02:19:05,959
Hold up.

1986
02:19:05,959 --> 02:19:06,860
Let me let me do this.

1987
02:19:10,600 --> 02:19:13,829
Oh, nothing you have goes.

1988
02:19:13,829 --> 02:19:15,030
This should probably be down here.

1989
02:19:15,030 --> 02:19:15,329
No.

1990
02:19:17,979 --> 02:19:19,579
Oh, what is this?

1991
02:19:19,579 --> 02:19:20,579
Is it a square one?

1992
02:19:22,090 --> 02:19:22,889
Oh, it is.

1993
02:19:23,670 --> 02:19:24,770
So where does this go?

1994
02:19:24,770 --> 02:19:25,469
Maybe here.

1995
02:19:26,909 --> 02:19:28,510
It's actually a lot harder because there could be so many

1996
02:19:28,510 --> 02:19:29,809
places where the tails can be.

1997
02:19:30,670 --> 02:19:30,870
All right.

1998
02:19:30,870 --> 02:19:31,969
Let's let's try this.

1999
02:19:33,120 --> 02:19:42,209
Oh, oh wait, somebody said use your cue.

2000
02:19:45,200 --> 02:19:46,200
I'm actually kind of scared.

2001
02:19:46,200 --> 02:19:48,399
Are you going to draw like a nuke on here?

2002
02:19:51,799 --> 02:19:53,600
Oh, what the fuck you actually got it.

2003
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:54,299
Yeah.

2004
02:19:54,299 --> 02:19:56,399
Well, because it can only it could have only been there,

2005
02:19:56,399 --> 02:19:56,700
right?

2006
02:19:56,700 --> 02:19:58,899
Because if you flip it, it'll be the other direction and I

2007
02:19:58,899 --> 02:20:00,299
can also do this.

2008
02:20:04,709 --> 02:20:05,709
Oh my God.

2009
02:20:06,309 --> 02:20:06,909
What is that?

2010
02:20:06,909 --> 02:20:07,409
What did you do?

2011
02:20:07,409 --> 02:20:08,010
What does that do?

2012
02:20:08,010 --> 02:20:11,409
I just I sonar checked and I think there are two there's

2013
02:20:11,409 --> 02:20:12,809
two ships in that area.

2014
02:20:16,809 --> 02:20:19,909
Zero color zero zero torpedo fired across a row or a

2015
02:20:19,909 --> 02:20:20,309
column.

2016
02:20:20,309 --> 02:20:21,709
It stops when it hits a ship.

2017
02:20:22,629 --> 02:20:24,559
What what?

2018
02:20:28,010 --> 02:20:28,709
Oh shit.

2019
02:20:28,709 --> 02:20:29,610
That's awesome.

2020
02:20:29,909 --> 02:20:33,510
What is that's the best ability I've ever seen.

2021
02:20:36,659 --> 02:20:37,959
I wish I would I do with this.

2022
02:20:39,079 --> 02:20:40,979
Well, now, you know that there's a ship there.

2023
02:20:40,979 --> 02:20:42,280
No, I just put a mine down.

2024
02:20:43,329 --> 02:20:44,229
Oh, you put a mine down.

2025
02:20:44,229 --> 02:20:45,229
I put a mine down as well.

2026
02:20:45,229 --> 02:20:46,030
I don't know what happens.

2027
02:20:46,030 --> 02:20:48,229
I assume on when you hit it, it just ends your turn.

2028
02:20:49,090 --> 02:20:49,290
All right.

2029
02:20:49,290 --> 02:20:53,209
So there's two ships.

2030
02:20:53,209 --> 02:20:55,110
This is kind of cool area.

2031
02:20:55,510 --> 02:20:56,209
This is amazing.

2032
02:20:56,209 --> 02:20:58,870
Yeah, I think it has to be here.

2033
02:21:00,049 --> 02:21:01,549
Yeah, and then probably down.

2034
02:21:01,549 --> 02:21:03,620
No, no to the to the right.

2035
02:21:03,620 --> 02:21:05,120
It must have been you.

2036
02:21:05,120 --> 02:21:06,120
I know you got points.

2037
02:21:07,040 --> 02:21:09,239
Let me do one of I think I might.

2038
02:21:14,459 --> 02:21:16,760
Oh, you can't do that.

2039
02:21:16,760 --> 02:21:17,059
Okay.

2040
02:21:17,059 --> 02:21:18,159
I thought you okay.

2041
02:21:20,879 --> 02:21:22,479
What if I put something?

2042
02:21:27,120 --> 02:21:27,520
Okay.

2043
02:21:28,620 --> 02:21:29,219
You know what?

2044
02:21:29,219 --> 02:21:30,819
I was talking a lot of shit.

2045
02:21:32,020 --> 02:21:34,020
Jerma this this could be meta.

2046
02:21:35,319 --> 02:21:36,120
You think it is.

2047
02:21:36,420 --> 02:21:37,120
Oh nice.

2048
02:21:37,120 --> 02:21:37,920
It's your little one.

2049
02:21:38,299 --> 02:21:40,500
There's going to be like a character tier list.

2050
02:21:44,479 --> 02:21:45,780
You have two small ones.

2051
02:21:45,780 --> 02:21:47,280
You have two twos or what?

2052
02:21:47,379 --> 02:21:48,180
I have two twos.

2053
02:21:48,180 --> 02:21:49,979
Yeah, I don't know if that's like because I paid for this

2054
02:21:49,979 --> 02:21:51,379
character and I'm paying to win.

2055
02:21:51,379 --> 02:21:52,379
Oh fuck.

2056
02:21:53,139 --> 02:21:53,540
All right.

2057
02:21:53,639 --> 02:21:53,940
All right.

2058
02:21:53,940 --> 02:21:55,840
You must have some points built up.

2059
02:21:55,840 --> 02:21:56,139
No.

2060
02:21:56,139 --> 02:21:57,139
Oh, I got four.

2061
02:21:58,879 --> 02:22:00,479
Presumably it's here.

2062
02:22:01,399 --> 02:22:01,700
Yeah.

2063
02:22:01,700 --> 02:22:02,200
All right.

2064
02:22:02,200 --> 02:22:02,500
Yeah.

2065
02:22:02,500 --> 02:22:02,899
Yeah.

2066
02:22:02,899 --> 02:22:03,100
Yeah.

2067
02:22:03,100 --> 02:22:04,100
I suck your little guy.

2068
02:22:04,100 --> 02:22:05,200
That's a little guy.

2069
02:22:05,200 --> 02:22:05,899
That's big.

2070
02:22:07,479 --> 02:22:08,879
You also have another little guy.

2071
02:22:10,040 --> 02:22:10,440
Oh, I do.

2072
02:22:10,440 --> 02:22:10,739
You're right.

2073
02:22:10,739 --> 02:22:11,040
Yeah.

2074
02:22:11,040 --> 02:22:11,639
This is fair.

2075
02:22:12,139 --> 02:22:14,840
Let's let's let's scan this is a big area.

2076
02:22:17,809 --> 02:22:19,409
Oh, someone's in here.

2077
02:22:19,809 --> 02:22:22,010
But on the just on the outskirts of it.

2078
02:22:22,010 --> 02:22:30,219
So probably here and there's a comeback mechanic because

2079
02:22:30,219 --> 02:22:36,280
every time you get shot you just get a point and go.

2080
02:22:37,110 --> 02:22:37,809
Oh no.

2081
02:22:38,569 --> 02:22:38,770
All right.

2082
02:22:38,770 --> 02:22:39,569
What do you got twos?

2083
02:22:40,940 --> 02:22:43,540
I have a I've got quite a few.

2084
02:22:43,840 --> 02:22:44,040
All right.

2085
02:22:44,040 --> 02:22:45,040
So that what do you got left?

2086
02:22:45,040 --> 02:22:48,829
You get this one could go this one can continue.

2087
02:22:48,829 --> 02:22:49,530
I think it's this one.

2088
02:22:50,139 --> 02:22:51,340
No, I already got that one.

2089
02:22:51,639 --> 02:22:52,040
No, I didn't.

2090
02:22:52,040 --> 02:22:52,340
Yeah.

2091
02:22:52,340 --> 02:22:52,940
Oh fuck.

2092
02:22:52,940 --> 02:22:54,040
I did already get that one.

2093
02:22:54,040 --> 02:22:54,340
Oops.

2094
02:22:54,340 --> 02:22:57,479
What's funny is you just gave up on another ship.

2095
02:22:57,579 --> 02:22:59,280
I thought I was the three one, but I already got the three

2096
02:22:59,280 --> 02:22:59,479
one.

2097
02:22:59,479 --> 02:22:59,979
I'm an idiot.

2098
02:23:00,459 --> 02:23:00,860
Yeah.

2099
02:23:02,690 --> 02:23:03,190
Okay.

2100
02:23:03,799 --> 02:23:04,700
No, that wasn't the three one.

2101
02:23:05,360 --> 02:23:05,559
Oops.

2102
02:23:05,559 --> 02:23:06,059
Not yet.

2103
02:23:06,360 --> 02:23:06,760
Okay.

2104
02:23:07,649 --> 02:23:13,079
No, wait, I can just do I can do this.

2105
02:23:14,739 --> 02:23:16,700
No, Trevor.

2106
02:23:16,700 --> 02:23:17,799
Where is this ship?

2107
02:23:17,799 --> 02:23:21,979
Yes, there's only one inside my sonar area.

2108
02:23:22,780 --> 02:23:24,680
I'm painting a picture around this ship.

2109
02:23:24,680 --> 02:23:25,079
Aren't I?

2110
02:23:26,129 --> 02:23:32,489
Maybe wait, I think that might be one of the greatest.

2111
02:23:33,120 --> 02:23:33,920
Is it this?

2112
02:23:34,909 --> 02:23:36,809
Oh, yeah, it's it's my weird.

2113
02:23:37,010 --> 02:23:38,110
I don't even know what to call that.

2114
02:23:40,829 --> 02:23:41,129
All right.

2115
02:23:41,129 --> 02:23:41,930
I got to be careful there.

2116
02:23:41,930 --> 02:23:44,030
I don't I keep using my big one.

2117
02:23:44,030 --> 02:23:45,030
I don't want to use the big one again.

2118
02:23:46,750 --> 02:23:47,549
So you got another two.

2119
02:23:47,549 --> 02:23:48,350
It's probably here.

2120
02:23:52,280 --> 02:23:53,079
I'm saving points.

2121
02:23:54,200 --> 02:23:54,600
Okay.

2122
02:23:54,600 --> 02:23:55,000
All right.

2123
02:23:55,000 --> 02:23:57,100
I think that's a good strategy.

2124
02:23:57,760 --> 02:24:03,489
So you either have your two jutting out to the right my

2125
02:24:03,489 --> 02:24:03,790
God.

2126
02:24:03,790 --> 02:24:04,790
This is it.

2127
02:24:04,790 --> 02:24:06,590
There's only one spot 10 points now.

2128
02:24:06,590 --> 02:24:06,989
Don't you?

2129
02:24:07,920 --> 02:24:09,219
I have I have four now.

2130
02:24:09,219 --> 02:24:10,520
I've been using my sonar.

2131
02:24:10,520 --> 02:24:11,920
That's why I know that's right here.

2132
02:24:15,040 --> 02:24:18,540
I also have a couple of mines just lingering.

2133
02:24:22,280 --> 02:24:25,370
What where is this one going straight?

2134
02:24:28,719 --> 02:24:29,219
Okay.

2135
02:24:29,319 --> 02:24:29,520
All right.

2136
02:24:29,520 --> 02:24:30,719
I'm saving up my points here.

2137
02:24:30,819 --> 02:24:31,420
This is a hit.

2138
02:24:31,899 --> 02:24:32,500
There we go.

2139
02:24:32,500 --> 02:24:33,200
Finally.

2140
02:24:33,200 --> 02:24:38,879
It must be down snow there and to the left.

2141
02:24:38,879 --> 02:24:41,360
Wait, how does this work?

2142
02:24:41,360 --> 02:24:43,159
If it flips, it's the same.

2143
02:24:43,159 --> 02:24:48,729
So this can only go to the left.

2144
02:24:48,729 --> 02:24:49,129
You got it.

2145
02:24:49,129 --> 02:24:49,329
Okay.

2146
02:24:49,329 --> 02:24:49,729
You got it.

2147
02:24:49,729 --> 02:24:50,229
You got it.

2148
02:24:51,239 --> 02:24:55,340
This this other ship it's able to sneak in weird areas.

2149
02:24:55,340 --> 02:24:56,840
Let me let me try the barrage.

2150
02:25:01,610 --> 02:25:02,610
You have a barrage.

2151
02:25:02,709 --> 02:25:03,809
You have enough points for that.

2152
02:25:04,250 --> 02:25:08,549
Oh, I let me tell you I got barrage points over here.

2153
02:25:08,750 --> 02:25:10,850
You think we're not barrage and you're out of your mind.

2154
02:25:20,030 --> 02:25:21,530
Oh, come on.

2155
02:25:22,100 --> 02:25:23,100
That one's good.

2156
02:25:23,829 --> 02:25:34,850
It must be and then it has to go up.

2157
02:25:35,450 --> 02:25:38,450
I'm going to be able to like you feel I'm at so many points

2158
02:25:38,450 --> 02:25:38,950
now.

2159
02:25:41,229 --> 02:25:41,629
All right.

2160
02:25:41,629 --> 02:25:42,829
I need to win quick.

2161
02:25:42,829 --> 02:25:43,930
I'm a little nervous.

2162
02:25:43,930 --> 02:25:47,379
You only have a two bitch.

2163
02:25:47,479 --> 02:25:47,680
All right.

2164
02:25:47,680 --> 02:25:48,479
Let's just clear this.

2165
02:25:51,579 --> 02:25:51,979
All right.

2166
02:25:52,479 --> 02:25:54,180
This is I got I got to make something happen here.

2167
02:25:55,360 --> 02:25:57,559
Your torpedo is just such a weapon.

2168
02:25:59,379 --> 02:26:01,579
Well, you got to you got to clean up your food first.

2169
02:26:05,090 --> 02:26:05,489
Thank you.

2170
02:26:05,489 --> 02:26:06,290
Oh, no.

2171
02:26:06,799 --> 02:26:07,299
Okay.

2172
02:26:09,819 --> 02:26:11,219
Oh, it's not it's not worth using this.

2173
02:26:11,319 --> 02:26:19,450
Um, can I not move?

2174
02:26:19,549 --> 02:26:20,049
Where can I?

2175
02:26:20,719 --> 02:26:21,819
Oh, I get it.

2176
02:26:22,120 --> 02:26:22,520
Okay.

2177
02:26:26,559 --> 02:26:27,360
Oh, no.

2178
02:26:29,239 --> 02:26:32,540
What we need one one only one only one doesn't make any

2179
02:26:32,540 --> 02:26:33,040
sense.

2180
02:26:33,340 --> 02:26:34,340
One it's a lot of sense.

2181
02:26:34,340 --> 02:26:36,239
If you think about it, no way not too hard though.

2182
02:26:36,340 --> 02:26:36,940
Well, they go come on.

2183
02:26:36,940 --> 02:26:37,739
I have a two left.

2184
02:26:38,879 --> 02:26:41,280
Oh, I thought it was counting that one as the one.

2185
02:26:41,950 --> 02:26:45,290
No, no, no, no sonar.

2186
02:26:45,290 --> 02:26:47,290
There was a little crazy because you knew is connected.

2187
02:26:47,389 --> 02:26:48,790
Yeah, but I thought there would be something over here too.

2188
02:26:49,229 --> 02:26:49,629
Right.

2189
02:26:49,629 --> 02:26:50,329
That makes sense.

2190
02:26:52,049 --> 02:26:52,450
I like that.

2191
02:26:52,450 --> 02:26:54,149
You can only sonar where you shoot.

2192
02:26:57,959 --> 02:27:01,149
Whoa, that's not the what are you talking about?

2193
02:27:01,819 --> 02:27:03,420
I don't get I thought it was the one that was up in

2194
02:27:03,420 --> 02:27:04,020
the left.

2195
02:27:05,010 --> 02:27:07,379
Oh, oh, fuck.

2196
02:27:07,979 --> 02:27:11,889
You know, you're you have a one fatal flaw right now and

2197
02:27:11,889 --> 02:27:15,090
it's that you have started to ships and then just quit

2198
02:27:15,090 --> 02:27:15,489
on them.

2199
02:27:15,590 --> 02:27:16,690
But I don't want to give you the points.

2200
02:27:16,790 --> 02:27:18,290
I know where the I know where those are.

2201
02:27:18,489 --> 02:27:22,479
Oh, if I hit I get you get a point.

2202
02:27:23,180 --> 02:27:24,479
Oh, yeah, you're absolutely right.

2203
02:27:24,479 --> 02:27:24,979
I do.

2204
02:27:27,309 --> 02:27:34,620
Oh, I only shot that cut so I could sonar it.

2205
02:27:36,239 --> 02:27:47,950
Let's just want to I want to metal with your let's see

2206
02:27:47,950 --> 02:27:48,649
what happens here.

2207
02:27:56,930 --> 02:28:01,219
Why should I put this I can win this right now if I

2208
02:28:01,219 --> 02:28:02,420
actually do this, correct.

2209
02:28:03,540 --> 02:28:07,250
So you've got you've got a two left.

2210
02:28:09,000 --> 02:28:13,379
You've got a three which is either home and cancel this

2211
02:28:13,579 --> 02:28:16,670
it's either here or here.

2212
02:28:17,069 --> 02:28:19,700
Wait, no, it'd have to be I flipped out.

2213
02:28:21,780 --> 02:28:22,479
It has to be here.

2214
02:28:25,639 --> 02:28:27,340
I have to write this shit.

2215
02:28:27,340 --> 02:28:30,340
I'm stupid who tweets we talking about two tweets.

2216
02:28:30,340 --> 02:28:31,940
No, I'm gonna win right now.

2217
02:28:31,940 --> 02:28:33,040
I just think it's gonna take me a minute.

2218
02:28:40,299 --> 02:28:41,200
Wait, why does it say that?

2219
02:28:41,500 --> 02:28:41,899
Hold on.

2220
02:28:43,190 --> 02:28:43,590
What is this one?

2221
02:28:43,590 --> 02:28:46,379
Then is this one?

2222
02:28:46,780 --> 02:28:48,479
There's still a two hanging out somewhere.

2223
02:28:48,479 --> 02:28:52,379
It's this three one or this for one one, two, three, four.

2224
02:28:54,370 --> 02:28:54,870
I got it.

2225
02:28:55,270 --> 02:28:56,270
One, two, three, four.

2226
02:28:56,270 --> 02:28:57,170
That's the only thing it could be.

2227
02:28:57,569 --> 02:28:58,370
It couldn't be anything else.

2228
02:28:58,370 --> 02:29:01,270
It has to be here has to be it has to be here.

2229
02:29:23,930 --> 02:29:24,430
Fuck.

2230
02:29:34,469 --> 02:29:35,469
What's the end of your turn?

2231
02:29:37,379 --> 02:29:39,180
You got three choices here.

2232
02:29:42,479 --> 02:29:43,780
I don't think I have that few.

2233
02:29:46,750 --> 02:29:48,250
No, what do you mean?

2234
02:29:50,120 --> 02:29:50,719
How does that work?

2235
02:29:50,719 --> 02:29:51,319
I dropped a bomb.

2236
02:29:51,319 --> 02:29:52,420
Do I I hit your mind?

2237
02:29:52,420 --> 02:29:53,020
Is that fine?

2238
02:29:54,079 --> 02:29:54,979
Oh, it's fine.

2239
02:29:55,079 --> 02:29:56,680
I think it just ends your turn automatically.

2240
02:29:56,979 --> 02:29:59,379
Oh, oh, it went that way.

2241
02:29:59,379 --> 02:30:00,079
I thought it was.

2242
02:30:01,840 --> 02:30:02,540
Oh my god.

2243
02:30:02,540 --> 02:30:04,840
This I think this is a great game mode.

2244
02:30:08,500 --> 02:30:12,180
Jerma, I've thought of the tweet.

2245
02:30:14,100 --> 02:30:16,000
I'm actually very confident on this one.

2246
02:30:16,860 --> 02:30:18,659
I have to fucking win a game here.

2247
02:30:19,459 --> 02:30:20,559
You want to hear my idea?

2248
02:30:20,559 --> 02:30:21,559
What's what's the idea?

2249
02:30:21,559 --> 02:30:22,059
Let's hear it.

2250
02:30:23,219 --> 02:30:24,319
It's a combination.

2251
02:30:25,020 --> 02:30:26,219
I had that one one two.

2252
02:30:26,219 --> 02:30:29,719
I just went to I just you actually got every ship tagged.

2253
02:30:29,719 --> 02:30:31,120
It is just the wrong direction.

2254
02:30:31,120 --> 02:30:31,520
Yeah.

2255
02:30:33,239 --> 02:30:33,440
All right.

2256
02:30:33,440 --> 02:30:33,940
What's the idea?

2257
02:30:33,940 --> 02:30:34,440
Let's hear it.

2258
02:30:35,040 --> 02:30:41,170
Well, right now I have to I get one tweet and I also get a

2259
02:30:41,170 --> 02:30:41,770
shirt.

2260
02:30:42,250 --> 02:30:47,540
Yeah, you get a shirt so we could combine the two feasibly

2261
02:30:49,209 --> 02:30:51,909
where you wear a shirt and you have to tweet it out.

2262
02:30:52,860 --> 02:30:56,790
God and when I went to the bathroom earlier actually did

2263
02:30:56,790 --> 02:31:03,000
a bit of research and I'm really fond of this new merch

2264
02:31:03,000 --> 02:31:03,299
company.

2265
02:31:03,299 --> 02:31:05,920
I found called Mega Milk.

2266
02:31:10,370 --> 02:31:13,569
Yeah, I thought it'd be apt to get you a Mega Milk shirt

2267
02:31:13,569 --> 02:31:15,270
and then have you tweet it out.

2268
02:31:16,510 --> 02:31:18,409
Am I do I have to is this part of the almond thing?

2269
02:31:19,950 --> 02:31:21,950
Oh, it's just that because it's two tweets now the almond

2270
02:31:21,950 --> 02:31:23,049
thing totally separate.

2271
02:31:23,920 --> 02:31:27,219
Yeah, he just wanted a second wasn't even a just a second

2272
02:31:27,219 --> 02:31:34,260
tweet like a sex Twitter.

2273
02:31:36,399 --> 02:31:39,200
Yeah, you're gonna have to change it to 18 plus.

2274
02:31:39,200 --> 02:31:39,700
Let's go.

2275
02:31:39,700 --> 02:31:42,000
I'm I'm trying as hard as I can for this one.

2276
02:31:42,000 --> 02:31:44,399
I am gonna pull out all the stops for this one.

2277
02:31:44,840 --> 02:31:46,940
What I'm gonna I'm gonna try someone new.

2278
02:31:46,940 --> 02:31:51,319
I think because I like the the different strategies.

2279
02:31:51,319 --> 02:31:58,549
I'm gonna try we did a gamble is always lose.

2280
02:31:58,649 --> 02:31:59,750
He's a gambler too.

2281
02:31:59,750 --> 02:32:03,420
And he's winning over and over gamblers lose as long as

2282
02:32:03,420 --> 02:32:04,120
I keep sitting here.

2283
02:32:04,120 --> 02:32:07,819
I'll lose eventually but he's he's just has the special

2284
02:32:07,819 --> 02:32:10,020
awareness that I don't have.

2285
02:32:11,389 --> 02:32:13,090
I'm gonna try William Cars Lake.

2286
02:32:14,979 --> 02:32:16,879
All right, what are we doing for this one?

2287
02:32:16,879 --> 02:32:20,389
Yeah, we got a I'm open.

2288
02:32:20,389 --> 02:32:22,889
Look, you're the one who's down the most right now.

2289
02:32:22,889 --> 02:32:27,200
So I think it's it's only fair that you set the wager

2290
02:32:27,200 --> 02:32:30,600
where you want to about if I win I get to remove the

2291
02:32:30,600 --> 02:32:34,600
Mega Milk shirt tweet and hand it over to you.

2292
02:32:35,360 --> 02:32:37,860
You want me to tweet Mega Milk and you would have to

2293
02:32:37,860 --> 02:32:39,040
tweet the Mega Milk shirt.

2294
02:32:39,239 --> 02:32:40,239
I think that's reasonable.

2295
02:32:40,239 --> 02:32:43,340
But you understand that you're gambling here that this

2296
02:32:43,340 --> 02:32:45,040
is a more than a double or nothing.

2297
02:32:45,040 --> 02:32:46,340
What happens if I win?

2298
02:32:46,639 --> 02:32:51,159
What do you say you're getting rid of the tweet?

2299
02:32:51,799 --> 02:32:53,899
Do you are you getting rid of the shirt as well?

2300
02:32:55,079 --> 02:32:57,579
No, I still I will still wear that shirt.

2301
02:32:57,579 --> 02:32:59,280
All right, but that's not we don't know that we don't

2302
02:32:59,280 --> 02:33:01,879
we're not positive yet, you know, right?

2303
02:33:01,879 --> 02:33:04,979
Okay, I would agree with you that if if I didn't have

2304
02:33:04,979 --> 02:33:06,680
the tweet, I probably pick a different shirt.

2305
02:33:08,780 --> 02:33:13,079
I don't want to flood your Twitter like five tweets in

2306
02:33:13,079 --> 02:33:15,180
a row of like different weird things.

2307
02:33:15,180 --> 02:33:15,680
I'm doing.

2308
02:33:16,079 --> 02:33:18,780
Yeah, it would just be just insanely.

2309
02:33:19,379 --> 02:33:19,680
All right.

2310
02:33:19,680 --> 02:33:19,879
No.

2311
02:33:19,879 --> 02:33:20,879
Okay, so you reverse it.

2312
02:33:20,879 --> 02:33:21,479
You're just bent.

2313
02:33:21,479 --> 02:33:25,020
You're saying no you but if I win because I've already

2314
02:33:25,420 --> 02:33:36,790
earned the shirt and the tweet, give me just a moment.

2315
02:33:37,709 --> 02:33:39,909
I have to think this is this is difficult in the way.

2316
02:33:45,280 --> 02:33:46,379
I don't like these shapes.

2317
02:33:47,940 --> 02:33:52,079
I think what would be equivalent to that in my mind because

2318
02:33:52,079 --> 02:34:04,530
this is a full reversal is I would need for you to get

2319
02:34:04,530 --> 02:34:08,299
a full catboy costume.

2320
02:34:10,959 --> 02:34:19,659
Yeah tweet a picture in this cat made costume something

2321
02:34:19,659 --> 02:34:27,399
to the effect of I'm having a good time right meow.

2322
02:34:32,860 --> 02:34:35,659
So I'm removing the last tweet and giving you the

2323
02:34:35,659 --> 02:34:36,459
Mega Milk tweet.

2324
02:34:37,639 --> 02:34:41,440
But if I lose I have to let's just make sure I get this

2325
02:34:41,440 --> 02:34:41,940
correct.

2326
02:34:42,940 --> 02:34:45,239
I have to tweet a picture of me holding my stomach talking

2327
02:34:45,239 --> 02:34:45,840
about almonds.

2328
02:34:45,840 --> 02:34:46,540
I love eating almonds.

2329
02:34:46,540 --> 02:34:48,940
So I throw up and then I have to tweet a picture of me

2330
02:34:48,940 --> 02:34:50,840
in a Mega Milk shirt in the bathroom.

2331
02:34:51,040 --> 02:34:52,440
I was using the bidet or something.

2332
02:34:52,920 --> 02:34:53,219
Sure.

2333
02:34:53,219 --> 02:34:54,920
Yeah, and then I have to tweet a picture of me in a

2334
02:34:54,920 --> 02:34:57,620
catboy made outfit saying I'm having a good time right

2335
02:34:57,620 --> 02:34:58,020
meow.

2336
02:34:58,020 --> 02:34:59,719
That's what I stand to lose.

2337
02:35:00,260 --> 02:35:03,360
Yeah, because you have to understand this when you say

2338
02:35:03,360 --> 02:35:05,559
you're getting rid of yours and reflecting on me.

2339
02:35:05,559 --> 02:35:06,959
That's it's like twofold, right?

2340
02:35:06,959 --> 02:35:07,260
It's true.

2341
02:35:07,260 --> 02:35:09,860
It's almost like right now you owe me a hundred dollars

2342
02:35:09,860 --> 02:35:11,659
will just translate it to money and then I'm going to

2343
02:35:11,659 --> 02:35:12,260
owe you a hundred.

2344
02:35:12,260 --> 02:35:13,559
It's a $200 swing.

2345
02:35:13,659 --> 02:35:15,260
I would rather pay you thousand dollars right now.

2346
02:35:16,459 --> 02:35:19,899
Well money money has no no effect here.

2347
02:35:26,629 --> 02:35:28,520
I mean you're in wait.

2348
02:35:28,520 --> 02:35:29,520
No, no, no, not in a hole.

2349
02:35:29,520 --> 02:35:31,520
I want to make sure this is a good placement.

2350
02:35:32,090 --> 02:35:39,719
Yeah, I'm in you're sure about this.

2351
02:35:41,729 --> 02:35:42,129
Yes.

2352
02:35:42,920 --> 02:35:43,819
Wait, wait.

2353
02:35:43,920 --> 02:35:48,059
I sorry you need to you need to I I pulled up your

2354
02:35:48,059 --> 02:35:50,059
stream instinctively to see how your chat felt about

2355
02:35:50,059 --> 02:35:52,260
that and I just saw one of your ships placements on

2356
02:35:52,260 --> 02:35:52,860
the bottom.

2357
02:35:53,370 --> 02:35:55,270
You need you should change your ships.

2358
02:35:56,280 --> 02:35:58,079
I just accidentally cheated.

2359
02:35:58,959 --> 02:36:00,360
Okay, I'm sorry.

2360
02:36:00,840 --> 02:36:01,440
You might have been happy.

2361
02:36:01,440 --> 02:36:02,040
I close it out.

2362
02:36:02,040 --> 02:36:02,639
I close it out.

2363
02:36:02,639 --> 02:36:04,840
I just wanted to see what they thought about the Catboy.

2364
02:36:04,840 --> 02:36:06,239
But what if that was the game winner?

2365
02:36:06,239 --> 02:36:06,940
What if that was the one?

2366
02:36:06,940 --> 02:36:07,340
What was that?

2367
02:36:07,340 --> 02:36:08,139
That was the game winner.

2368
02:36:08,139 --> 02:36:08,540
Don't think of it.

2369
02:36:08,540 --> 02:36:09,739
It's it's battleship.

2370
02:36:09,739 --> 02:36:11,139
It could have been the game winner.

2371
02:36:12,340 --> 02:36:13,139
That was the game winner.

2372
02:36:13,139 --> 02:36:13,739
That could have been the game.

2373
02:36:13,739 --> 02:36:14,639
It was not the game winner.

2374
02:36:14,739 --> 02:36:16,739
I think I deserve you eating an almond for a tweet.

2375
02:36:17,969 --> 02:36:19,770
I'll eat an almond for a tweet on the house.

2376
02:36:19,770 --> 02:36:20,569
Yeah, that's fair.

2377
02:36:23,540 --> 02:36:25,139
Because you got the game winner.

2378
02:36:28,399 --> 02:36:31,159
I should have left it and you never would have clicked on

2379
02:36:31,159 --> 02:36:31,760
those faces.

2380
02:36:32,159 --> 02:36:33,860
You can still do all of that.

2381
02:36:33,860 --> 02:36:34,860
I don't know.

2382
02:36:41,219 --> 02:36:42,219
I'm not ready.

2383
02:36:42,219 --> 02:36:42,719
Oh my god.

2384
02:36:42,719 --> 02:36:44,620
I feel like I'm doing my hair in the mirror and it's just

2385
02:36:44,620 --> 02:36:45,319
not it does.

2386
02:36:45,319 --> 02:36:46,020
I don't like it.

2387
02:36:48,049 --> 02:36:50,549
I actually love my ships placement right now.

2388
02:36:54,680 --> 02:36:55,379
All right, let's go.

2389
02:36:56,670 --> 02:36:56,969
All right.

2390
02:36:56,969 --> 02:36:57,469
All right.

2391
02:36:58,479 --> 02:36:59,879
You still have torpedo man.

2392
02:37:00,280 --> 02:37:02,079
I choose a different person.

2393
02:37:02,079 --> 02:37:02,979
I chose airsprite.

2394
02:37:02,979 --> 02:37:03,379
You did.

2395
02:37:04,139 --> 02:37:05,440
Oh wait, we have the same man.

2396
02:37:06,180 --> 02:37:07,079
Oh, this is a mirror.

2397
02:37:07,079 --> 02:37:07,579
This is perfect.

2398
02:37:07,579 --> 02:37:07,879
Okay.

2399
02:37:08,479 --> 02:37:09,780
Oh, it's a nine.

2400
02:37:10,579 --> 02:37:11,780
Was it nine for the torpedo?

2401
02:37:12,829 --> 02:37:13,930
No, it was like six.

2402
02:37:15,940 --> 02:37:17,239
Okay, off rip.

2403
02:37:17,780 --> 02:37:18,680
Let's make this play.

2404
02:37:20,569 --> 02:37:22,170
No should say my money.

2405
02:37:26,799 --> 02:37:27,299
Oh my god.

2406
02:37:28,319 --> 02:37:29,319
It must be going up, right?

2407
02:37:30,219 --> 02:37:31,219
Oh, I thought you would have.

2408
02:37:32,479 --> 02:37:32,780
Okay.

2409
02:37:32,979 --> 02:37:33,379
All right.

2410
02:37:39,139 --> 02:37:45,989
Oh, oh, brutal.

2411
02:37:45,989 --> 02:37:48,989
Oh, that is really bad for me.

2412
02:37:49,090 --> 02:37:50,790
What a randomly place ship too, right?

2413
02:37:50,790 --> 02:37:54,620
It's it's, you know, as isolated as they could have made

2414
02:37:54,620 --> 02:37:54,819
it.

2415
02:37:54,819 --> 02:37:59,120
Unfortunately, that's that's oh no.

2416
02:37:59,120 --> 02:38:01,420
My Lord, no, please.

2417
02:38:01,420 --> 02:38:01,819
Please.

2418
02:38:01,819 --> 02:38:04,319
I know you're down bad, but cheating really.

2419
02:38:04,719 --> 02:38:08,420
Oh, no, no, you're in trouble.

2420
02:38:08,819 --> 02:38:09,620
Oh, no.

2421
02:38:09,719 --> 02:38:10,819
Well, I'm getting points.

2422
02:38:10,819 --> 02:38:12,120
I'm getting really rich.

2423
02:38:12,120 --> 02:38:12,719
There's a thing.

2424
02:38:12,719 --> 02:38:14,920
My brain has to take a second to think about where this is.

2425
02:38:16,059 --> 02:38:16,959
It's that way.

2426
02:38:16,959 --> 02:38:21,059
It's either or it could be anywhere, right?

2427
02:38:24,899 --> 02:38:26,100
I think you're a cheeky fuck.

2428
02:38:27,299 --> 02:38:27,700
Nope.

2429
02:38:29,000 --> 02:38:30,399
There's so many places it could be.

2430
02:38:30,399 --> 02:38:31,299
It's it's shocking.

2431
02:38:32,770 --> 02:38:32,969
Okay.

2432
02:38:32,969 --> 02:38:34,670
I am rich in points though.

2433
02:38:36,700 --> 02:38:39,399
Let's let's let's just do let's just chill.

2434
02:38:39,399 --> 02:38:43,440
Let's just do this is if it is anything, it could be the L

2435
02:38:43,440 --> 02:38:51,629
shape, but more realistically, I think this could be I could

2436
02:38:51,629 --> 02:38:52,629
secure the bag.

2437
02:38:55,260 --> 02:38:58,959
What's oh, yeah, yeah, let's do this because it's the L

2438
02:38:58,959 --> 02:38:59,260
shape.

2439
02:38:59,260 --> 02:39:00,459
It would be no, it doesn't.

2440
02:39:00,840 --> 02:39:01,239
Yeah.

2441
02:39:02,639 --> 02:39:02,940
Okay.

2442
02:39:02,940 --> 02:39:03,840
It is the L shape.

2443
02:39:05,459 --> 02:39:05,959
What?

2444
02:39:08,020 --> 02:39:08,420
Yeah.

2445
02:39:08,719 --> 02:39:10,620
Why fuck you fucking got it?

2446
02:39:10,920 --> 02:39:11,420
You got you.

2447
02:39:11,420 --> 02:39:12,120
What did I get?

2448
02:39:12,120 --> 02:39:14,520
You got you had you hit the wrong one.

2449
02:39:16,520 --> 02:39:18,819
I went for the bottom of the L so I could sonar.

2450
02:39:19,389 --> 02:39:20,989
Do I save my money for an airstrike?

2451
02:39:21,860 --> 02:39:22,059
Okay.

2452
02:39:22,059 --> 02:39:22,959
Yeah, let me do this though.

2453
02:39:30,030 --> 02:39:31,530
I've made a devious plot.

2454
02:39:37,799 --> 02:39:46,430
So it had if it's this then it has to be this way, right?

2455
02:39:46,829 --> 02:39:50,430
It has to be that way has to be it has to be this way

2456
02:39:50,829 --> 02:39:51,430
with this way.

2457
02:39:51,729 --> 02:39:53,530
If it's that which I don't know if it's that or not.

2458
02:40:00,040 --> 02:40:01,639
Well, this could be the big L.

2459
02:40:04,709 --> 02:40:05,809
I'm going to do something here.

2460
02:40:08,000 --> 02:40:09,200
You might think this is insane.

2461
02:40:09,860 --> 02:40:10,760
My God don't do it.

2462
02:40:10,760 --> 02:40:11,059
Come on.

2463
02:40:12,690 --> 02:40:13,190
Okay.

2464
02:40:14,190 --> 02:40:14,690
All right.

2465
02:40:15,190 --> 02:40:16,889
I have deduced what it is.

2466
02:40:17,590 --> 02:40:18,190
What is it?

2467
02:40:19,440 --> 02:40:19,840
I don't know.

2468
02:40:20,280 --> 02:40:20,879
I think it's the L.

2469
02:40:26,629 --> 02:40:27,329
It's the L.

2470
02:40:27,700 --> 02:40:28,600
Oh, it is the L.

2471
02:40:28,799 --> 02:40:29,399
Oh, which way?

2472
02:40:38,840 --> 02:40:39,840
He lives another day.

2473
02:40:47,770 --> 02:40:48,370
All right, let's go.

2474
02:40:49,709 --> 02:40:50,010
Okay.

2475
02:40:50,010 --> 02:40:56,540
I have I have an airstrike now fire at all cells.

2476
02:40:56,940 --> 02:40:58,340
What does it do?

2477
02:40:59,260 --> 02:41:00,860
Oh, it's it's it's like the torpedo.

2478
02:41:06,610 --> 02:41:26,719
Oh, that is the most OP thing I've ever seen in my life.

2479
02:41:28,190 --> 02:41:29,389
I gotta get one of those quick.

2480
02:41:31,360 --> 02:41:32,760
I gotta get one of those right now.

2481
02:41:32,959 --> 02:41:33,360
Damn it.

2482
02:41:35,920 --> 02:41:36,420
First of all,

2483
02:41:36,420 --> 02:41:37,520
Catboy Jerma.

2484
02:41:38,959 --> 02:41:39,959
What it's not the L.

2485
02:41:39,959 --> 02:41:40,959
It's not the L.

2486
02:41:41,659 --> 02:41:42,559
What are you talking about?

2487
02:41:42,559 --> 02:41:43,459
It's not the L.

2488
02:41:43,459 --> 02:41:44,260
What the hell is it then?

2489
02:41:44,260 --> 02:41:45,159
It's this little guy.

2490
02:41:45,159 --> 02:41:45,959
No, it's not.

2491
02:41:45,959 --> 02:41:47,059
What the fuck is happening?

2492
02:41:47,059 --> 02:41:48,059
It's this way.

2493
02:41:51,889 --> 02:41:53,489
The airstrike is so OP.

2494
02:42:03,280 --> 02:42:04,879
Like a baby having a tantrum.

2495
02:42:11,059 --> 02:42:11,360
All right.

2496
02:42:12,260 --> 02:42:16,770
Let's let's just keep it simple here.

2497
02:42:17,170 --> 02:42:20,100
So I this to right here.

2498
02:42:21,079 --> 02:42:25,299
Does it go down or does it go most likely here?

2499
02:42:25,299 --> 02:42:25,600
Right?

2500
02:42:26,139 --> 02:42:26,440
Right?

2501
02:42:26,440 --> 02:42:26,840
Yeah.

2502
02:42:26,840 --> 02:42:33,110
Which means this has to go and then that's I'm giving you

2503
02:42:33,110 --> 02:42:34,010
so many points.

2504
02:42:35,500 --> 02:42:35,899
That's right.

2505
02:42:35,899 --> 02:42:37,700
I think I've tagged every ship.

2506
02:42:37,700 --> 02:42:41,600
So I just need to I need to finish it out.

2507
02:42:41,600 --> 02:42:41,799
Now.

2508
02:42:41,799 --> 02:42:43,700
What is this one to the left down up?

2509
02:42:43,700 --> 02:42:44,399
I don't know.

2510
02:42:45,420 --> 02:42:47,620
Best odds are here, but it could be this one or this one.

2511
02:42:52,040 --> 02:42:53,440
Oh, so that must be this one.

2512
02:42:54,569 --> 02:42:54,969
What?

2513
02:42:55,670 --> 02:42:56,069
Wait, what?

2514
02:42:57,270 --> 02:42:58,170
Thank God.

2515
02:42:58,469 --> 02:43:00,069
It's down there.

2516
02:43:00,569 --> 02:43:01,370
You don't know where it is.

2517
02:43:01,370 --> 02:43:01,969
You have no idea.

2518
02:43:02,569 --> 02:43:03,370
It could be anywhere.

2519
02:43:04,309 --> 02:43:05,209
I do know though.

2520
02:43:05,879 --> 02:43:07,079
I do I do get it.

2521
02:43:09,270 --> 02:43:10,969
I shouldn't I shouldn't I should do this.

2522
02:43:14,250 --> 02:43:17,149
Are you you must be flush with points right now.

2523
02:43:22,370 --> 02:43:24,610
I am I got it.

2524
02:43:24,610 --> 02:43:26,409
I got to get the most amount of surface area here.

2525
02:43:31,180 --> 02:43:32,180
Oh, I got one.

2526
02:43:32,280 --> 02:43:32,979
That was your two.

2527
02:43:34,350 --> 02:43:35,750
You just suck it.

2528
02:43:35,750 --> 02:43:37,750
You literally just sunk it.

2529
02:43:38,930 --> 02:43:40,530
Oh no.

2530
02:43:41,110 --> 02:43:41,610
Oh God.

2531
02:43:41,610 --> 02:43:41,909
Okay.

2532
02:43:41,909 --> 02:43:42,309
All right.

2533
02:43:42,309 --> 02:43:42,709
All right.

2534
02:43:42,709 --> 02:43:43,209
All right.

2535
02:43:43,709 --> 02:43:43,909
All right.

2536
02:43:43,909 --> 02:43:44,809
This is bad.

2537
02:43:45,010 --> 02:43:46,309
This is now bad for me.

2538
02:43:47,750 --> 02:43:48,350
Okay.

2539
02:43:48,950 --> 02:43:51,649
Oh, I you're in trouble here, but so am I.

2540
02:43:52,049 --> 02:43:54,049
In a deep crock of shit.

2541
02:43:56,200 --> 02:43:57,899
This could be literally any one of these though.

2542
02:43:58,200 --> 02:44:00,270
I only have two ships left.

2543
02:44:00,270 --> 02:44:01,069
It can't be anything.

2544
02:44:01,170 --> 02:44:03,469
I mean, it's either it's either it's either this way or that way.

2545
02:44:04,069 --> 02:44:04,670
That is true.

2546
02:44:04,770 --> 02:44:05,370
And I got it.

2547
02:44:06,079 --> 02:44:08,379
Well, no, you didn't get it because there's a lot.

2548
02:44:08,479 --> 02:44:09,379
There's a lot that it could be.

2549
02:44:09,379 --> 02:44:09,979
That's right.

2550
02:44:11,899 --> 02:44:13,299
There is a lot that it could be.

2551
02:44:14,780 --> 02:44:19,219
Oh, wait, that's that's physically not possible for it to be that way.

2552
02:44:19,319 --> 02:44:23,649
What do you mean?

2553
02:44:26,520 --> 02:44:26,920
All right.

2554
02:44:27,559 --> 02:44:28,059
Okay.

2555
02:44:31,229 --> 02:44:33,430
So this this this has to be here.

2556
02:44:34,260 --> 02:44:36,260
We know that you do know that.

2557
02:44:36,799 --> 02:44:40,620
Oh, and so that that leaves me with a wait.

2558
02:44:40,620 --> 02:44:43,159
Am I am I still missing a ship?

2559
02:44:44,010 --> 02:44:45,510
I still haven't tagged one ship.

2560
02:44:56,700 --> 02:44:57,899
This is so nerve-wracking.

2561
02:44:57,899 --> 02:44:59,100
It's too nerve-wracking.

2562
02:44:59,399 --> 02:45:01,100
This has to be left or right.

2563
02:45:14,020 --> 02:45:15,420
I could put like my poker face.

2564
02:45:15,420 --> 02:45:16,020
I don't know what to do.

2565
02:45:16,020 --> 02:45:17,620
I just been hiding from the camera.

2566
02:45:20,239 --> 02:45:21,540
I don't I think an airstrike.

2567
02:45:21,540 --> 02:45:27,639
Here's a waste at this stage of the game.

2568
02:45:27,639 --> 02:45:35,379
The airstrike kind of you son of a bitch, you son of a bitch little bomb and it

2569
02:45:35,379 --> 02:45:39,079
just ends what happened when you get two counter shots.

2570
02:45:39,180 --> 02:45:39,979
What about that?

2571
02:45:39,979 --> 02:45:40,579
What just happened?

2572
02:45:40,879 --> 02:45:41,479
I don't know.

2573
02:45:41,479 --> 02:45:42,479
I have no idea what just happened.

2574
02:45:42,479 --> 02:45:44,879
I think since I hit it you get two counter shots or something.

2575
02:45:44,879 --> 02:45:46,379
I got two counter shots.

2576
02:45:46,680 --> 02:45:51,979
Yeah, I wouldn't even pay attention.

2577
02:46:04,069 --> 02:46:06,270
This tells me if it's a three or two ship.

2578
02:46:07,200 --> 02:46:08,500
Oh, it's a three ship.

2579
02:46:24,139 --> 02:46:27,100
You have some dastardly to somewhere.

2580
02:46:50,079 --> 02:46:51,180
No, you did not.

2581
02:46:51,180 --> 02:46:51,879
No way.

2582
02:46:51,979 --> 02:46:53,079
No way.

2583
02:46:53,280 --> 02:46:53,879
No way.

2584
02:46:53,879 --> 02:46:56,079
You got that this impossible.

2585
02:46:56,280 --> 02:46:57,780
It's not possible.

2586
02:46:58,180 --> 02:46:59,379
It's impossible.

2587
02:47:00,280 --> 02:47:08,239
Oh my God, why did you get that?

2588
02:47:08,239 --> 02:47:10,940
That was like a 4% chance to hit that one.

2589
02:47:11,040 --> 02:47:13,739
What I do is I flick my mouse and I click.

2590
02:47:17,100 --> 02:47:17,899
Oh my God.

2591
02:47:17,899 --> 02:47:20,299
That was the most stressful game.

2592
02:47:24,069 --> 02:47:28,159
Oh my God.

2593
02:47:28,159 --> 02:47:29,159
What the fuck?

2594
02:47:29,659 --> 02:47:30,760
That was insane.

2595
02:47:30,760 --> 02:47:32,059
Oh my God.

2596
02:47:33,979 --> 02:47:37,379
How do I even get anything shaved off of this?

2597
02:47:37,379 --> 02:47:37,879
Look at you.

2598
02:47:37,879 --> 02:47:39,180
Look at your guy's face.

2599
02:47:39,180 --> 02:47:40,479
He's so sullen.

2600
02:47:41,549 --> 02:47:43,850
Oh, that's this is okay.

2601
02:47:43,950 --> 02:47:44,549
At this point.

2602
02:47:44,549 --> 02:47:46,750
I almost own your Twitter account.

2603
02:47:53,459 --> 02:47:54,959
Even know what to do about this.

2604
02:47:55,360 --> 02:47:58,260
I want to keep playing to try to like get some of this back.

2605
02:47:58,659 --> 02:48:01,760
Yeah, but I can't like I can't even win a game.

2606
02:48:02,360 --> 02:48:02,959
No.

2607
02:48:03,819 --> 02:48:05,319
Okay, you know what?

2608
02:48:05,620 --> 02:48:06,719
You know what you could do.

2609
02:48:07,969 --> 02:48:12,770
We could make a what I owe you what it's it's three tweets three

2610
02:48:12,770 --> 02:48:15,170
tweets and like I feel I don't I feel like a shit in a bag

2611
02:48:15,170 --> 02:48:15,870
or whatever it was.

2612
02:48:15,870 --> 02:48:18,069
But what was it where shirt?

2613
02:48:18,569 --> 02:48:19,870
We have to wear a shirt.

2614
02:48:20,569 --> 02:48:21,569
It's three tweets.

2615
02:48:21,569 --> 02:48:23,170
It's 96 subs.

2616
02:48:28,159 --> 02:48:32,159
You know at this point I got a stream key $70.

2617
02:48:37,629 --> 02:48:38,229
Okay.

2618
02:48:40,430 --> 02:48:41,430
That's like the okay.

2619
02:48:41,829 --> 02:48:44,729
This is what happens to the person that gets last place in

2620
02:48:44,729 --> 02:48:45,629
Mario Party.

2621
02:48:46,129 --> 02:48:46,629
You know what I mean?

2622
02:48:46,629 --> 02:48:49,129
Oh, but you least we gave you fucking 10 coins.

2623
02:48:49,329 --> 02:48:51,930
Yeah, thanks in the final five turns.

2624
02:48:51,930 --> 02:48:53,729
They throw you a couple.

2625
02:48:57,829 --> 02:48:58,729
What is it?

2626
02:48:58,729 --> 02:48:59,430
What do you feel in your heart?

2627
02:48:59,430 --> 02:49:00,430
You want to win this back?

2628
02:49:00,430 --> 02:49:03,829
I can't imagine what to use the worst thing that you owe.

2629
02:49:03,930 --> 02:49:05,430
It's it's surely not the money.

2630
02:49:05,969 --> 02:49:09,469
No, it's it's it's it's definitely the last one.

2631
02:49:09,469 --> 02:49:11,840
You just said it's the cat made one.

2632
02:49:11,840 --> 02:49:12,639
That one's tough.

2633
02:49:12,739 --> 02:49:13,739
That one's tough.

2634
02:49:14,040 --> 02:49:19,379
Probably the last two last two tweets are rough but Twix the

2635
02:49:19,379 --> 02:49:20,479
cat in the milk.

2636
02:49:20,579 --> 02:49:24,899
Which one is worse both equal equally bad.

2637
02:49:25,000 --> 02:49:27,600
Equally well, I would have to get in and out going to outfit

2638
02:49:27,600 --> 02:49:27,799
it.

2639
02:49:28,200 --> 02:49:28,399
Okay.

2640
02:49:28,399 --> 02:49:32,370
Yeah, no, it's it's it's it's something it's it's surely

2641
02:49:32,370 --> 02:49:34,569
something but how do we how do we even give you an incentive

2642
02:49:34,569 --> 02:49:34,870
anymore?

2643
02:49:34,870 --> 02:49:35,670
You have ones.

2644
02:49:35,870 --> 02:49:36,969
Okay, you just won.

2645
02:49:37,270 --> 02:49:41,069
You sat at the blackjack table like 200 bucks and you have

2646
02:49:41,069 --> 02:49:42,969
like $15,000 in chips.

2647
02:49:42,969 --> 02:49:43,569
Like what do you care?

2648
02:49:43,569 --> 02:49:45,569
You know, I have I have my watch now.

2649
02:49:46,200 --> 02:49:48,000
Yeah, you have the watch or you don't even need to play.

2650
02:49:48,000 --> 02:49:49,399
You're like you're good.

2651
02:49:49,879 --> 02:49:51,479
This is I know I feel great.

2652
02:49:51,479 --> 02:49:55,780
I feel great about this, but I am I'm still a sucker.

2653
02:49:55,979 --> 02:49:57,780
For monetary investments.

2654
02:49:57,879 --> 02:50:03,540
Okay, so I'm willing to make you a wager you making me a

2655
02:50:03,540 --> 02:50:03,940
wager.

2656
02:50:03,940 --> 02:50:04,239
Okay.

2657
02:50:04,239 --> 02:50:07,620
What's the wager you right now?

2658
02:50:08,920 --> 02:50:11,420
Oh me a just a little under $500.

2659
02:50:11,520 --> 02:50:11,819
Sure.

2660
02:50:13,709 --> 02:50:22,649
Would you say that $500 is about how much one of those tweets

2661
02:50:22,649 --> 02:50:24,049
is milk boys worth?

2662
02:50:29,110 --> 02:50:32,010
Yeah, I would say so I would say $500 is probably what the

2663
02:50:32,010 --> 02:50:33,110
word that would be worth for me.

2664
02:50:33,209 --> 02:50:34,780
I think okay.

2665
02:50:35,770 --> 02:50:39,069
Here's what I'm going to do and you can decline this offer.

2666
02:50:39,739 --> 02:50:42,440
Because I think I'm more I'm willing to give up the Mega

2667
02:50:42,440 --> 02:50:44,840
Milk shirt tweet and stream.

2668
02:50:44,840 --> 02:50:46,340
I'm willing to give that up.

2669
02:50:46,440 --> 02:50:46,739
Wow.

2670
02:50:46,739 --> 02:50:52,649
Okay in exchange you already owe me $500.

2671
02:50:53,680 --> 02:50:58,479
Let's just say if you win, we'll just cut those.

2672
02:50:59,139 --> 02:50:59,540
All right.

2673
02:50:59,540 --> 02:51:00,739
They're just eliminated.

2674
02:51:00,940 --> 02:51:03,940
What so the two tweets with the costumes?

2675
02:51:04,549 --> 02:51:07,250
No, just well, let's not get in over our heads.

2676
02:51:07,350 --> 02:51:09,049
I'm trying to rewrite the contract here.

2677
02:51:09,149 --> 02:51:14,809
Yes, the milk boy tweet stream are gone.

2678
02:51:15,600 --> 02:51:21,770
Okay, in exchange if you win.

2679
02:51:22,069 --> 02:51:22,469
Okay.

2680
02:51:22,870 --> 02:51:23,170
All right.

2681
02:51:23,170 --> 02:51:27,899
If I win you still owe me all that but I need you because

2682
02:51:27,899 --> 02:51:33,719
you live in Vegas to take $1,000 go to the casino and put

2683
02:51:33,719 --> 02:51:35,129
it on black.

2684
02:51:35,229 --> 02:51:36,430
Oh my God.

2685
02:51:36,729 --> 02:51:40,629
And if I win that bet you have to give me $2,000.

2686
02:51:43,780 --> 02:51:44,979
It's a pretty good bet.

2687
02:51:45,479 --> 02:51:46,780
That's a thousand bucks though.

2688
02:51:47,850 --> 02:51:49,450
Well, you already owe me 500.

2689
02:51:49,450 --> 02:51:53,360
It's more like oh I know it's a $500 bet.

2690
02:51:53,360 --> 02:51:58,159
Basically, is this worth $500 to potentially erase now?

2691
02:51:58,459 --> 02:52:02,290
I will say if you lose you owe three tweets one stream

2692
02:52:02,290 --> 02:52:06,290
with a shirt on cat made outfit pregnant almond milk

2693
02:52:06,290 --> 02:52:06,790
boy.

2694
02:52:07,090 --> 02:52:10,090
You have to give me $1,000 to go to the casino with

2695
02:52:10,090 --> 02:52:10,290
it.

2696
02:52:10,290 --> 02:52:12,090
Put it on a roulette table on black.

2697
02:52:12,799 --> 02:52:13,500
It's a lot.

2698
02:52:18,889 --> 02:52:23,090
We we would you be willing to remove the cat made outfit

2699
02:52:23,090 --> 02:52:24,590
if we made this 1500.

2700
02:52:26,159 --> 02:52:31,250
Wow, that's how bad the cat made outfit is honestly like

2701
02:52:31,750 --> 02:52:33,350
tweeting in general.

2702
02:52:33,930 --> 02:52:39,799
It's like so like it's the tweets themselves.

2703
02:52:40,100 --> 02:52:42,899
Yeah, I could only dress up in any costume, but I have

2704
02:52:42,899 --> 02:52:48,239
to tweet like fuck the tweet is look I would almost be

2705
02:52:48,239 --> 02:52:52,239
creating enemies if I got rid of that for how just you

2706
02:52:52,239 --> 02:52:53,139
I mean look at your chat.

2707
02:52:53,139 --> 02:52:54,239
They're fervorish about this.

2708
02:52:54,239 --> 02:52:56,879
If I got rid of this they I mean they would be there

2709
02:52:56,879 --> 02:52:59,979
would be riots if they know what they're if they don't

2710
02:52:59,979 --> 02:53:00,579
let them fool you.

2711
02:53:00,579 --> 02:53:02,879
They already got something because you owe me 500.

2712
02:53:02,879 --> 02:53:05,579
You're saying it's basically a thousand dollars on this

2713
02:53:05,579 --> 02:53:09,280
game and I will literally I will literally like livecast

2714
02:53:09,280 --> 02:53:09,680
it to you.

2715
02:53:11,620 --> 02:53:12,819
I can't do that.

2716
02:53:13,620 --> 02:53:16,020
I can like I can I can take a picture before and after

2717
02:53:16,020 --> 02:53:18,920
and it's either gonna be like a picture of an audio

2718
02:53:18,920 --> 02:53:21,920
experience just do like your phone recording and you

2719
02:53:21,920 --> 02:53:24,219
can just audit auditorily bring me through it.

2720
02:53:25,809 --> 02:53:30,190
You know what look I I love catboy, but I would never

2721
02:53:30,190 --> 02:53:32,889
give I would never take away a man's opportunity to win

2722
02:53:32,889 --> 02:53:34,190
back his dignity.

2723
02:53:35,010 --> 02:53:35,409
So all right.

2724
02:53:35,409 --> 02:53:35,809
So hold on.

2725
02:53:35,809 --> 02:53:40,500
So if if so, this is all of if you lose this if I lose

2726
02:53:40,500 --> 02:53:43,870
this so we are just rid of the we are just going over

2727
02:53:43,870 --> 02:53:45,270
what happens at the end of this game.

2728
02:53:46,000 --> 02:53:49,979
So if if you win this game, yes, I have to do all of

2729
02:53:49,979 --> 02:53:52,579
that and I have to do the 1500 on black.

2730
02:53:53,020 --> 02:53:54,520
It's a lot you have to do a lot.

2731
02:53:54,819 --> 02:53:57,620
This is like an astronomical amount of stuff to do.

2732
02:53:58,420 --> 02:53:59,920
It's an insane list of errands.

2733
02:53:59,920 --> 02:54:02,620
It'll take you literally like weeks to accomplish

2734
02:54:02,620 --> 02:54:03,120
everything.

2735
02:54:04,709 --> 02:54:11,159
But if you win and you wipe out the two tweets, you

2736
02:54:11,159 --> 02:54:13,950
got to wipe you got to wipe out all three tweets all

2737
02:54:13,950 --> 02:54:14,950
three.

2738
02:54:15,350 --> 02:54:23,659
No, actually even though the almond one can stay really

2739
02:54:23,659 --> 02:54:24,860
there's so many terms of this contract.

2740
02:54:24,860 --> 02:54:26,059
We have to like write this down.

2741
02:54:26,459 --> 02:54:29,360
Oh, just to clarify you win.

2742
02:54:30,090 --> 02:54:34,829
You only have to go post the almond boy tweet.

2743
02:54:34,829 --> 02:54:36,229
Everything else is gone.

2744
02:54:37,379 --> 02:54:42,700
Yes, if I win, it's three tweets and hey, hold on.

2745
02:54:42,700 --> 02:54:43,799
I'll sweeten the deal.

2746
02:54:43,799 --> 02:54:44,700
I'll sweeten the deal for you.

2747
02:54:46,010 --> 02:54:50,750
If even if I win, I'll sweeten the deal you take you

2748
02:54:50,750 --> 02:54:52,649
get rid of those two tweets that the cat made out

2749
02:54:52,649 --> 02:54:56,020
for one and the mega milk tweet and I'll tell you

2750
02:54:56,020 --> 02:54:57,219
right now you delete those.

2751
02:54:57,889 --> 02:55:06,120
I'll do I'll do I'll do 250 on black with $250.

2752
02:55:06,120 --> 02:55:07,219
I'll do 250 on black.

2753
02:55:08,040 --> 02:55:11,450
That's that's lower than that's not sweeter.

2754
02:55:11,850 --> 02:55:13,549
Oh, that sweetens the deal because otherwise it

2755
02:55:13,549 --> 02:55:14,149
would have been wiped out.

2756
02:55:14,149 --> 02:55:14,850
I wouldn't have to do it.

2757
02:55:15,639 --> 02:55:18,940
Oh, you'll still do still do 250 for me.

2758
02:55:19,040 --> 02:55:20,620
Yeah, that's sweetening for you.

2759
02:55:27,719 --> 02:55:28,120
I'm in.

2760
02:55:29,690 --> 02:55:31,190
Oh, all right.

2761
02:55:31,190 --> 02:55:31,790
Let's go.

2762
02:55:32,520 --> 02:55:34,920
This is the final this is that we can't go past this

2763
02:55:34,920 --> 02:55:37,920
though because after this it's it's it's I mean,

2764
02:55:37,920 --> 02:55:40,420
it's it's it's like the deed to your home.

2765
02:55:40,819 --> 02:55:43,020
Yeah, I'm gonna start giving you like titles to cars

2766
02:55:43,020 --> 02:55:43,420
and stuff.

2767
02:55:44,579 --> 02:55:45,479
This is the last one.

2768
02:55:45,479 --> 02:55:45,879
Okay.

2769
02:55:45,879 --> 02:55:46,280
All right.

2770
02:55:46,379 --> 02:55:48,879
Oh gosh, I'm already nervous.

2771
02:55:48,879 --> 02:55:51,079
I can feel a lump forming in my throat.

2772
02:55:53,059 --> 02:55:53,559
All right.

2773
02:55:53,860 --> 02:55:56,159
I think I'm gonna keep it with William Cars Lake.

2774
02:55:56,159 --> 02:55:57,760
The airstrike seems pretty good.

2775
02:55:58,389 --> 02:55:58,989
I agree.

2776
02:56:03,440 --> 02:56:03,940
All right.

2777
02:56:04,440 --> 02:56:07,239
All right for everything really for everything here.

2778
02:56:07,719 --> 02:56:15,860
All these positions matter so much somebody said Fox

2779
02:56:15,860 --> 02:56:26,360
only from a lose lose lose.

2780
02:56:26,360 --> 02:56:28,459
I know you guys want me to lose cuz then I have that's

2781
02:56:28,459 --> 02:56:30,559
like two weeks of things that I have to do.

2782
02:56:33,090 --> 02:56:33,989
I have to win this.

2783
02:56:33,989 --> 02:56:35,290
I have to put on all the stops.

2784
02:56:35,290 --> 02:56:35,889
I've got to win.

2785
02:56:39,120 --> 02:56:41,520
What a difficult this is.

2786
02:56:41,520 --> 02:56:44,520
This is me taking like back shit that I have to do.

2787
02:56:45,520 --> 02:56:47,819
Honestly, even if I win I still lose.

2788
02:56:47,920 --> 02:56:49,219
I just don't lose as much.

2789
02:56:50,229 --> 02:56:52,930
Yeah, there's because there's there's zero risk for me,

2790
02:56:52,930 --> 02:56:53,229
right?

2791
02:56:53,229 --> 02:56:54,329
It's zero risk for you.

2792
02:56:57,969 --> 02:56:59,170
I'm clawing back.

2793
02:56:59,170 --> 02:57:03,709
You're you're getting more you're gonna lose now.

2794
02:57:03,709 --> 02:57:05,309
I like this.

2795
02:57:17,989 --> 02:57:18,889
Are you placing things?

2796
02:57:19,559 --> 02:57:20,459
I've placed everything.

2797
02:57:20,459 --> 02:57:20,659
Yeah.

2798
02:57:20,760 --> 02:57:23,059
Oh, I'm still on the waiting screen.

2799
02:57:25,520 --> 02:57:26,620
Oh, yeah, it does say waiting.

2800
02:57:27,959 --> 02:57:30,159
Do we do we need a real we may need a redo?

2801
02:57:30,760 --> 02:57:31,159
Okay.

2802
02:57:31,159 --> 02:57:31,659
All right.

2803
02:57:33,760 --> 02:57:36,260
Oh, yeah, I'm my games like frozen.

2804
02:57:36,959 --> 02:57:38,159
Let's let's reconnect.

2805
02:57:38,159 --> 02:57:40,860
I'll just try to remember this.

2806
02:57:41,059 --> 02:57:41,959
I'll just create a new one.

2807
02:57:41,959 --> 02:57:42,760
I'll send you the code again.

2808
02:57:45,430 --> 02:57:47,030
God is telling you not to do this.

2809
02:57:47,860 --> 02:57:50,860
Well, if God were telling me not to do this, he's got a weird

2810
02:57:50,860 --> 02:57:53,059
way of saying it because I have to literally dress up in three

2811
02:57:53,059 --> 02:57:57,559
different costumes and God wants you to dress up as a God.

2812
02:57:57,559 --> 02:58:02,860
I want me God wants this God is here with us on this battleship

2813
02:58:02,860 --> 02:58:03,260
board.

2814
02:58:05,750 --> 02:58:11,139
I've sent you the code Colossus Bay.

2815
02:58:11,139 --> 02:58:11,940
I am now in.

2816
02:58:13,680 --> 02:58:14,579
All right, should be good to go.

2817
02:58:17,889 --> 02:58:19,190
And here we go.

2818
02:58:20,719 --> 02:58:21,120
All right.

2819
02:58:23,889 --> 02:58:25,190
This is for all the marvels here.

2820
02:58:27,139 --> 02:58:28,139
I'm gonna have to do this.

2821
02:58:28,540 --> 02:58:33,340
There's swaths of people invested on my victory.

2822
02:58:33,340 --> 02:58:36,739
I almost have to turn my monitors off.

2823
02:58:37,739 --> 02:58:40,540
They're gonna like DM me on discord monitors off.

2824
02:58:42,790 --> 02:58:44,290
This is like an episode of schooled.

2825
02:58:44,290 --> 02:58:58,459
All right, I placed this one before it was here.

2826
02:59:05,389 --> 03:00:01,229
Remember you have to think I so I don't know what to do.

2827
03:00:02,569 --> 03:00:05,069
There's so many ways that this could go so wrong.

2828
03:00:28,329 --> 03:00:29,329
Okay, I'm done.

2829
03:00:29,329 --> 03:00:29,729
I'm done.

2830
03:00:29,729 --> 03:00:30,629
Oh my God.

2831
03:00:34,270 --> 03:00:34,969
Are you prepared?

2832
03:00:37,430 --> 03:00:37,930
Almost.

2833
03:00:45,920 --> 03:00:51,520
This is this is a preposterous amount of gambling on battleship.

2834
03:00:55,569 --> 03:00:57,469
I think it's you that's that must be you, right?

2835
03:00:58,010 --> 03:00:58,409
Yeah.

2836
03:01:00,139 --> 03:01:01,739
Okay, first shot is everything.

2837
03:01:03,500 --> 03:01:12,979
Oh no, it's two.

2838
03:01:20,489 --> 03:01:21,889
I thought it was the three.

2839
03:01:21,889 --> 03:01:23,889
I thought you put up I thought you put the three in a weird

2840
03:01:23,889 --> 03:01:24,389
place.

2841
03:01:24,690 --> 03:01:25,790
I'm not that cheeky.

2842
03:01:25,790 --> 03:01:26,790
I'm not that cheeky.

2843
03:01:33,629 --> 03:01:35,329
Let's let's play this strategically.

2844
03:01:37,879 --> 03:01:38,180
All right.

2845
03:01:38,180 --> 03:01:38,479
All right.

2846
03:01:38,479 --> 03:01:38,979
Now, whatever.

2847
03:01:45,930 --> 03:01:47,729
Don't remind at the very beginning.

2848
03:01:51,799 --> 03:01:52,899
This isn't a three.

2849
03:01:54,059 --> 03:01:57,209
It could I mean my best bet.

2850
03:01:57,209 --> 03:01:58,409
No, it's only one.

2851
03:01:58,409 --> 03:01:59,010
I should go here.

2852
03:02:00,639 --> 03:02:01,040
Yes.

2853
03:02:03,590 --> 03:02:03,989
Okay.

2854
03:02:04,590 --> 03:02:05,989
That's fucking phenomenal.

2855
03:02:05,989 --> 03:02:11,440
I mean, that's just oh my God.

2856
03:02:13,989 --> 03:02:15,790
Oh my God is doing this.

2857
03:02:15,790 --> 03:02:18,090
What the fuck Loki put the mask back.

2858
03:02:18,889 --> 03:02:20,590
What the fuck is this bullshit?

2859
03:02:20,690 --> 03:02:21,889
This is ridiculous.

2860
03:02:21,989 --> 03:02:24,690
There's no way no fucking way.

2861
03:02:24,690 --> 03:02:25,690
This is possible.

2862
03:02:26,889 --> 03:02:28,389
If I get the third one, I'm cheating.

2863
03:02:30,739 --> 03:02:34,639
No fuck that fuck that Poseidon throwing a goddamn trident

2864
03:02:34,639 --> 03:02:35,040
at me.

2865
03:02:35,239 --> 03:02:36,540
This is insanity.

2866
03:02:36,739 --> 03:02:37,540
This is insanity.

2867
03:02:37,540 --> 03:02:38,040
Okay.

2868
03:02:38,340 --> 03:02:39,340
Oh my God.

2869
03:02:39,540 --> 03:02:40,639
Oh my God.

2870
03:02:42,079 --> 03:02:43,079
Oh my God.

2871
03:02:47,010 --> 03:02:49,809
If you hit my if you hit my thing to me, let's just fucking

2872
03:02:49,809 --> 03:02:50,610
let's go.

2873
03:02:51,510 --> 03:02:53,809
Oh God, I love a God.

2874
03:02:54,309 --> 03:02:55,909
I'm a bomb fucking everywhere.

2875
03:02:56,709 --> 03:02:57,309
Over here too.

2876
03:02:57,309 --> 03:02:57,909
Let's go.

2877
03:02:59,139 --> 03:02:59,540
Okay.

2878
03:03:02,360 --> 03:03:04,159
My God, you just had so much money.

2879
03:03:04,159 --> 03:03:09,649
I didn't realize I just gave you the fucking Northrop gumption

2880
03:03:09,649 --> 03:03:10,149
supply.

2881
03:03:10,149 --> 03:03:12,750
I can't believe you just did like six in a row.

2882
03:03:13,649 --> 03:03:14,149
God.

2883
03:03:15,049 --> 03:03:15,850
Hey, is he going like this?

2884
03:03:15,850 --> 03:03:18,649
Is he like looking down like an iPhone that has like this

2885
03:03:18,649 --> 03:03:19,149
frame up?

2886
03:03:21,389 --> 03:03:22,090
I just have it.

2887
03:03:22,190 --> 03:03:22,590
All right.

2888
03:03:23,590 --> 03:03:24,290
I gotta think about this.

2889
03:03:25,389 --> 03:03:26,389
These are bigger than two.

2890
03:03:27,489 --> 03:03:34,860
So which means this could be the top one's hard because it

2891
03:03:34,860 --> 03:03:35,959
could be any of those four.

2892
03:03:35,959 --> 03:03:43,170
It could it's it's this one's gonna I bottom ones easier bottom

2893
03:03:43,170 --> 03:03:44,969
ones for the easiest one because it's literally you can go

2894
03:03:44,969 --> 03:03:45,569
one way or the other.

2895
03:03:49,569 --> 03:03:49,969
All right.

2896
03:03:50,739 --> 03:03:51,239
You know, it's good.

2897
03:03:51,239 --> 03:03:51,940
Well now it's hard.

2898
03:04:06,180 --> 03:04:07,180
Phenomenal guess.

2899
03:04:07,379 --> 03:04:07,680
All right.

2900
03:04:09,520 --> 03:04:10,020
That's good.

2901
03:04:10,020 --> 03:04:10,520
That was good.

2902
03:04:10,920 --> 03:04:12,219
But wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

2903
03:04:12,219 --> 03:04:16,159
Not not quite as this could be this could be the Tetris

2904
03:04:16,159 --> 03:04:16,860
piece or the elf.

2905
03:04:19,319 --> 03:04:20,319
Yeah, that's fair.

2906
03:04:37,440 --> 03:04:38,739
Well, I know what it is now.

2907
03:04:39,139 --> 03:04:40,239
You do know what it is now.

2908
03:04:40,239 --> 03:04:43,790
Okay, I can't fucking believe what I'm looking at right here.

2909
03:04:44,090 --> 03:04:46,190
Oh, yeah, I just got three ships in a row.

2910
03:04:46,690 --> 03:04:50,920
I do.

2911
03:04:53,930 --> 03:04:54,329
All right.

2912
03:04:54,629 --> 03:04:56,829
The problem is you only have the good shit left.

2913
03:04:57,799 --> 03:04:58,399
That's true.

2914
03:05:01,909 --> 03:05:03,610
You son of a bitch.

2915
03:05:03,610 --> 03:05:04,209
That's huge.

2916
03:05:05,270 --> 03:05:06,270
That's actually huge.

2917
03:05:08,420 --> 03:05:10,219
Oh my god, you son of a bitch.

2918
03:05:10,219 --> 03:05:16,180
That's actually actually ignored the god.

2919
03:05:16,180 --> 03:05:17,280
This is this is bad.

2920
03:05:17,280 --> 03:05:18,379
This is really bad.

2921
03:05:19,280 --> 03:05:19,879
That's huge.

2922
03:05:20,860 --> 03:05:22,360
But can I capitalize on this?

2923
03:05:22,860 --> 03:05:25,360
I want a phenomenal start for that to happen.

2924
03:05:25,459 --> 03:05:27,059
Just a missed airstrike.

2925
03:05:28,639 --> 03:05:29,340
At the bottom.

2926
03:05:29,840 --> 03:05:30,139
All right.

2927
03:05:30,139 --> 03:05:38,180
Now I'm confused though, cuz is this the L go?

2928
03:05:38,280 --> 03:05:38,780
No.

2929
03:05:39,079 --> 03:05:40,579
Yeah, could the L go this way?

2930
03:05:41,219 --> 03:05:42,520
Can the L go that way?

2931
03:05:42,520 --> 03:05:45,940
I think it can to go like boom.

2932
03:05:45,940 --> 03:05:46,440
Boom.

2933
03:05:48,549 --> 03:05:51,670
I think the L could go that way as it goes boom.

2934
03:05:51,670 --> 03:05:52,069
Boom.

2935
03:05:52,979 --> 03:05:54,579
But that could also be the three.

2936
03:05:55,409 --> 03:05:56,110
I'm going for it.

2937
03:05:57,819 --> 03:05:58,219
All right.

2938
03:05:58,219 --> 03:05:59,120
I think I got you now.

2939
03:05:59,219 --> 03:05:59,719
I got you.

2940
03:06:00,899 --> 03:06:01,399
Wait, what?

2941
03:06:01,979 --> 03:06:02,979
Oh, no, you do not got me.

2942
03:06:02,979 --> 03:06:03,280
Okay.

2943
03:06:03,280 --> 03:06:03,979
What's what happened?

2944
03:06:04,079 --> 03:06:05,079
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

2945
03:06:05,479 --> 03:06:06,280
Oh shit.

2946
03:06:06,280 --> 03:06:07,379
It's this way.

2947
03:06:07,379 --> 03:06:08,280
Oh, yeah.

2948
03:06:15,819 --> 03:06:16,319
Okay.

2949
03:06:17,520 --> 03:06:18,920
So it's just either up or down, right?

2950
03:06:18,920 --> 03:06:19,620
Simple enough.

2951
03:06:24,889 --> 03:06:25,989
Are you serious?

2952
03:06:27,659 --> 03:06:34,329
That's terrible.

2953
03:06:34,430 --> 03:06:37,030
I'm oh, I think I know where that is.

2954
03:06:37,129 --> 03:06:38,129
I think I know what you just did.

2955
03:06:38,860 --> 03:06:39,360
Oh, yeah.

2956
03:06:39,559 --> 03:06:40,059
I think so.

2957
03:06:40,790 --> 03:06:41,489
Take a try.

2958
03:06:41,690 --> 03:06:42,389
Take a gander.

2959
03:06:53,340 --> 03:06:54,040
I don't think you know.

2960
03:06:55,340 --> 03:06:59,500
I have abilities.

2961
03:06:59,500 --> 03:07:00,399
I'm saving the points.

2962
03:07:00,399 --> 03:07:01,399
It's gonna come in handy.

2963
03:07:05,459 --> 03:07:05,860
It's all right.

2964
03:07:05,860 --> 03:07:06,459
He's missing.

2965
03:07:06,659 --> 03:07:07,159
We're good.

2966
03:07:12,819 --> 03:07:13,219
All right.

2967
03:07:16,670 --> 03:07:21,979
Well, now at least I know what this is, right?

2968
03:07:21,979 --> 03:07:23,979
This is I'm not freaking myself out for no reason, right?

2969
03:07:25,559 --> 03:07:25,860
No.

2970
03:07:25,860 --> 03:07:26,059
All right.

2971
03:07:26,059 --> 03:07:33,659
I got you here now.

2972
03:07:45,159 --> 03:07:46,860
I think I'm gonna sonar this one here.

2973
03:07:47,260 --> 03:07:59,600
Why did I do that?

2974
03:08:13,549 --> 03:08:14,149
Why did I do that?

2975
03:08:14,950 --> 03:08:15,350
All right.

2976
03:08:24,020 --> 03:08:24,620
Two?

2977
03:08:25,770 --> 03:08:26,770
How could it be two?

2978
03:08:29,459 --> 03:08:30,760
I'm so confused.

2979
03:08:30,860 --> 03:08:31,559
What's going on?

2980
03:08:32,229 --> 03:08:34,129
This has to be the three.

2981
03:08:35,250 --> 03:08:36,250
But what the heck?

2982
03:08:36,750 --> 03:08:38,049
Why would it say there are two?

2983
03:08:40,659 --> 03:08:41,659
It's either this way or this way.

2984
03:08:45,819 --> 03:08:46,420
Wait a minute.

2985
03:08:49,670 --> 03:08:51,469
You got a motherfucker right here somewhere.

2986
03:08:59,139 --> 03:08:59,540
Yes.

2987
03:09:04,409 --> 03:09:05,510
Oh God.

2988
03:09:06,620 --> 03:09:07,819
The mines are terrifying.

2989
03:09:23,790 --> 03:09:24,489
What are you doing?

2990
03:09:24,489 --> 03:09:24,889
Are you placing a mine?

2991
03:09:24,889 --> 03:09:25,190
Fuck!

2992
03:09:25,190 --> 03:09:26,389
I'm freaking out.

2993
03:09:26,389 --> 03:09:26,790
All right.

2994
03:09:27,870 --> 03:09:28,170
All right.

2995
03:09:28,170 --> 03:09:28,370
All right.

2996
03:09:28,370 --> 03:09:28,770
All right.

2997
03:09:29,239 --> 03:09:29,940
I was placing a mine.

2998
03:09:43,520 --> 03:09:43,920
That's right.

2999
03:09:43,920 --> 03:09:44,420
That's a given.

3000
03:09:44,620 --> 03:09:45,219
It's pretty big.

3001
03:09:47,780 --> 03:09:49,379
A two and a three.

3002
03:10:04,219 --> 03:10:05,020
What's he up to now?

3003
03:10:14,909 --> 03:10:16,409
Another goddamn mine.

3004
03:10:22,020 --> 03:10:22,520
I'll just wait.

3005
03:10:22,520 --> 03:10:22,920
Patience.

3006
03:10:22,920 --> 03:10:23,520
Patience.

3007
03:10:25,850 --> 03:10:26,950
Well, wait.

3008
03:10:26,950 --> 03:10:28,850
Yeah, it has to be here.

3009
03:10:29,149 --> 03:10:30,649
No, but is that certain?

3010
03:10:32,059 --> 03:10:32,360
It is.

3011
03:10:32,360 --> 03:10:33,059
That's certain.

3012
03:10:33,729 --> 03:10:35,399
That's certain.

3013
03:10:36,610 --> 03:10:37,709
It's like Minesweeper.

3014
03:10:37,709 --> 03:10:39,010
This is it has to be here.

3015
03:10:39,309 --> 03:10:40,110
It is certain.

3016
03:10:41,290 --> 03:10:42,389
It's either here or here.

3017
03:10:46,540 --> 03:10:47,040
It's not certain.

3018
03:10:47,040 --> 03:11:11,440
I'll tell you that much.

3019
03:11:13,340 --> 03:11:15,440
So wait, does the sonar mean two ships?

3020
03:11:15,440 --> 03:11:17,639
Or does it mean two spaces where there are things?

3021
03:11:19,120 --> 03:11:20,819
I will I will grant you this.

3022
03:11:21,120 --> 03:11:28,260
It means there are two things in that area which includes mines.

3023
03:11:28,459 --> 03:11:35,979
A bunch of people in chat were saying it means there's two ships.

3024
03:11:36,280 --> 03:11:37,379
You fucked with me.

3025
03:11:48,360 --> 03:11:49,159
Oh, this could be anywhere.

3026
03:12:02,430 --> 03:12:02,930
Fuck.

3027
03:12:02,930 --> 03:12:03,129
Yes.

3028
03:12:03,129 --> 03:12:03,629
Fuck.

3029
03:12:04,500 --> 03:12:04,799
Come on.

3030
03:12:04,799 --> 03:12:05,399
Give me something good.

3031
03:12:05,399 --> 03:12:06,000
Something good.

3032
03:12:07,370 --> 03:12:07,870
Yes.

3033
03:12:08,270 --> 03:12:10,270
Dude, mines are the worst.

3034
03:12:21,139 --> 03:12:21,940
This is heating up.

3035
03:12:21,940 --> 03:12:22,139
All right.

3036
03:12:22,139 --> 03:12:24,639
So now so it has to be right here.

3037
03:12:26,909 --> 03:12:27,209
Right.

3038
03:12:27,209 --> 03:12:27,909
Of course.

3039
03:12:28,110 --> 03:12:28,510
Okay.

3040
03:12:28,909 --> 03:12:32,209
Now I just got two of your little shit ships.

3041
03:12:32,209 --> 03:12:33,709
My little shitters.

3042
03:12:33,709 --> 03:12:36,610
It's either on one side or the other.

3043
03:12:36,909 --> 03:12:38,110
So here's what I'm going to do.

3044
03:12:38,819 --> 03:12:40,020
I'm going to go like this.

3045
03:12:44,329 --> 03:12:47,930
Oh, what they'll get four shots for free.

3046
03:12:47,930 --> 03:12:48,329
Come on.

3047
03:12:48,430 --> 03:12:48,930
Come on, baby.

3048
03:12:49,030 --> 03:12:49,329
Come on.

3049
03:12:49,329 --> 03:12:49,729
Get me there.

3050
03:12:49,729 --> 03:12:50,229
Get me there.

3051
03:12:50,530 --> 03:12:51,030
Yes.

3052
03:12:51,229 --> 03:12:51,629
Yes.

3053
03:12:55,049 --> 03:12:55,549
Oh my God.

3054
03:12:55,549 --> 03:12:57,149
My mind strategy worked.

3055
03:12:57,450 --> 03:12:57,850
Wait a minute.

3056
03:12:57,850 --> 03:12:58,649
It's not over.

3057
03:12:59,049 --> 03:12:59,850
It's not over.

3058
03:13:06,639 --> 03:13:08,639
I flooded my field with mines.

3059
03:13:20,530 --> 03:13:21,629
Oh, I'm sweating.

3060
03:13:44,950 --> 03:13:45,450
Yes.

3061
03:13:45,750 --> 03:13:46,850
Oh no.

3062
03:13:48,159 --> 03:13:49,260
Oh, this is bad.

3063
03:13:50,879 --> 03:13:52,579
Oh, this is this is actually kind of bad.

3064
03:13:56,129 --> 03:13:57,329
I can't be so haphazard.

3065
03:13:58,680 --> 03:13:59,280
It ain't over here.

3066
03:14:04,209 --> 03:14:07,879
I think I think I got him right here.

3067
03:14:10,120 --> 03:14:11,319
I think I got him right here.

3068
03:14:14,739 --> 03:14:16,040
I think I got him right here.

3069
03:14:17,260 --> 03:14:20,420
It's either right here or it's right here.

3070
03:14:22,180 --> 03:14:23,579
Can I can I do it?

3071
03:14:23,879 --> 03:14:24,780
Did he do that?

3072
03:14:24,780 --> 03:14:26,579
Did he do it right in the middle?

3073
03:14:47,479 --> 03:14:47,879
You got it.

3074
03:14:47,879 --> 03:14:48,280
You got it.

3075
03:14:48,280 --> 03:14:49,879
But but but this could hit me.

3076
03:14:49,879 --> 03:14:50,479
This could hit me.

3077
03:14:55,139 --> 03:14:56,540
Oh, come on.

3078
03:14:56,540 --> 03:15:12,129
No, so it's here.

3079
03:15:12,129 --> 03:15:12,329
Here.

3080
03:15:12,329 --> 03:15:13,030
That's it, right?

3081
03:15:35,520 --> 03:15:36,020
All right.

3082
03:15:36,020 --> 03:15:36,520
All right.

3083
03:15:36,520 --> 03:15:38,719
So we're going to do one more.

3084
03:15:39,020 --> 03:15:48,299
We're going to do one more at this point.

3085
03:15:49,100 --> 03:15:52,040
Last one is more about.

3086
03:15:54,340 --> 03:15:55,940
Offer a man who has it all.

3087
03:16:01,860 --> 03:16:04,840
All right, so shit.

3088
03:16:12,520 --> 03:16:13,620
What do I even owe you?

3089
03:16:13,620 --> 03:16:18,590
I owe you like you won the showcase on the price is right.

3090
03:16:18,590 --> 03:16:20,389
There's nothing more I could even offer you.

3091
03:16:21,690 --> 03:16:24,989
I won the free trip to Hawaii from United Airlines.

3092
03:16:25,190 --> 03:16:27,389
I won the house in Malibu.

3093
03:16:27,790 --> 03:16:30,790
I won the entire Lexus car.

3094
03:16:31,649 --> 03:16:32,850
You got both showcases.

3095
03:16:32,850 --> 03:16:34,149
They don't even do that on the show.

3096
03:16:34,760 --> 03:16:39,260
I think I got I feel like James Holtz hour right now.

3097
03:16:40,760 --> 03:16:43,959
The most winning game show contestant of all time.

3098
03:16:52,530 --> 03:16:56,729
Well, that was that was a blast.

3099
03:16:57,129 --> 03:17:00,229
I'm glad I owe three weeks of content.

3100
03:17:03,030 --> 03:17:04,030
It's so much.

3101
03:17:04,329 --> 03:17:05,430
It's almost too much.

3102
03:17:06,030 --> 03:17:08,329
I will say does this make it easier?

3103
03:17:10,090 --> 03:17:13,790
We can space it out, you know, a payment plan.

3104
03:17:13,790 --> 03:17:16,989
So to speak a monthly payment plan.

3105
03:17:17,389 --> 03:17:21,290
Yeah, you know, we can't just do three tweets in a week or something.

3106
03:17:21,290 --> 03:17:22,489
That's a that's absurd.

3107
03:17:22,790 --> 03:17:24,190
I'm the ball by almonds.

3108
03:17:25,559 --> 03:17:26,459
You do need a ball.

3109
03:17:26,459 --> 03:17:28,530
That's that's the least of your concerns.

3110
03:17:28,530 --> 03:17:29,829
Almonds are easy to come by.

3111
03:17:31,979 --> 03:17:32,280
All right.

3112
03:17:32,280 --> 03:17:34,879
Can I can I consolidate this this internet?

3113
03:17:34,879 --> 03:17:36,079
Can I just consolidate this?

3114
03:17:37,309 --> 03:17:37,709
Yeah.

3115
03:17:38,280 --> 03:17:38,579
Okay.

3116
03:17:39,079 --> 03:17:39,879
Here's my offer.

3117
03:17:40,379 --> 03:17:44,979
Please one tweet in a catboy outfit with almonds in front of me looking

3118
03:17:44,979 --> 03:17:49,879
into the mirror of an oven with the stomach sticking out stomach.

3119
03:17:49,879 --> 03:17:51,079
Big big glow.

3120
03:17:51,079 --> 03:17:52,379
I eat too many almonds, whatever.

3121
03:17:52,680 --> 03:17:55,079
And like I have like a mega milk photo behind me.

3122
03:17:58,219 --> 03:18:04,000
I will I will allow you to consolidate two of the tweets into one.

3123
03:18:04,399 --> 03:18:07,809
Three is a bit.

3124
03:18:08,829 --> 03:18:12,530
It's a bit what the almond tweets your tweet, right?

3125
03:18:13,389 --> 03:18:14,590
Technically that technically.

3126
03:18:14,590 --> 03:18:14,790
Yeah.

3127
03:18:14,989 --> 03:18:15,290
Yep.

3128
03:18:16,690 --> 03:18:18,090
So I feel fine.

3129
03:18:18,389 --> 03:18:21,889
What if we just consolidate cat in milk into one?

3130
03:18:29,969 --> 03:18:32,270
I did not think I was going to be having this conversation.

3131
03:18:33,920 --> 03:18:36,420
Oh, let's combine cat and milk into one.

3132
03:18:36,420 --> 03:18:40,120
I'm just sitting there like we were going to play Battleship a mega milk

3133
03:18:40,120 --> 03:18:51,020
made if you will like you at some like a doorstep like an old with an

3134
03:18:51,020 --> 03:18:55,959
old-timey bag of milk, you know, like like a tree like you got all of

3135
03:18:55,959 --> 03:18:56,459
your six.

3136
03:18:56,559 --> 03:18:56,860
Okay.

3137
03:18:56,860 --> 03:18:58,860
Could I just have a huge thing of milk?

3138
03:18:59,260 --> 03:19:00,760
That's a that's a mega milk.

3139
03:19:00,760 --> 03:19:01,260
You know what I mean?

3140
03:19:01,260 --> 03:19:02,260
That's a lot of milk.

3141
03:19:02,659 --> 03:19:05,159
How much milk a huge amount?

3142
03:19:05,559 --> 03:19:07,860
It would need to be minimum like five gallons.

3143
03:19:08,059 --> 03:19:09,659
I don't know if I even get that much.

3144
03:19:10,200 --> 03:19:11,000
Well, that's what I'm saying.

3145
03:19:11,000 --> 03:19:11,799
Like how big is this?

3146
03:19:11,799 --> 03:19:16,170
Because a gallon of milk is like that's normal two gallons even somewhat

3147
03:19:16,170 --> 03:19:27,940
feasible, but standard what how about we consolidate it easily, right?

3148
03:19:27,940 --> 03:19:29,440
You so it's you, right?

3149
03:19:30,479 --> 03:19:36,680
Hey, it's me, Jerma and you're wearing a cat boy costume, but it's a

3150
03:19:36,680 --> 03:19:38,379
cat made outfit, right?

3151
03:19:38,479 --> 03:19:38,780
Okay.

3152
03:19:39,079 --> 03:19:43,379
And you're and you have like the milk delivery cartons and it's just

3153
03:19:43,379 --> 03:19:47,180
like like a perspective of someone opening their door to greet you.

3154
03:19:47,479 --> 03:19:51,579
And then the caption is mega milk made and you know, I feel like

3155
03:19:51,579 --> 03:19:53,579
that's a good consolidation there.

3156
03:19:55,149 --> 03:19:57,520
Oh, that's somehow worse.

3157
03:19:57,819 --> 03:20:01,950
So it's way worse it for that.

3158
03:20:01,950 --> 03:20:08,670
I I would almost be willing to just, you know, throw out the almond

3159
03:20:08,670 --> 03:20:11,100
tweet, you know, we for mega milk made.

3160
03:20:11,799 --> 03:20:15,399
That's just one big juicy tweet.

3161
03:20:18,500 --> 03:20:20,940
It needs to be almond milk.

3162
03:20:21,840 --> 03:20:22,440
Yeah.

3163
03:20:22,739 --> 03:20:24,340
Yeah, it's mega milk made.

3164
03:20:24,540 --> 03:20:30,129
You're not wearing a cat made outfit and and you have almond milk

3165
03:20:30,129 --> 03:20:33,129
that you're delivering with the caption mega milk made.

3166
03:20:35,040 --> 03:20:40,170
Can we play one more for what for me to look at me?

3167
03:20:40,170 --> 03:20:40,670
Look at me.

3168
03:20:40,670 --> 03:20:41,370
Do you see me?

3169
03:20:44,670 --> 03:20:46,870
Three hours and 20 minutes has changed you.

3170
03:20:46,870 --> 03:20:50,500
You do look concerned in a way.

3171
03:20:50,600 --> 03:20:52,600
Like I would be concerned if I walked by you.

3172
03:20:52,700 --> 03:20:53,000
All right.

3173
03:20:53,000 --> 03:20:53,399
All right.

3174
03:20:53,399 --> 03:20:58,299
His art is we're gonna do we're gonna do we're gonna do one more.

3175
03:20:58,600 --> 03:20:59,200
One more.

3176
03:21:01,690 --> 03:21:02,489
How do I even?

3177
03:21:02,590 --> 03:21:02,889
All right.

3178
03:21:03,590 --> 03:21:05,940
We're gonna fuck.

3179
03:21:05,940 --> 03:21:06,440
Okay.

3180
03:21:06,440 --> 03:21:08,709
So this is how it's uh-huh.

3181
03:21:08,809 --> 03:21:11,209
So I will accept your omega milk made.

3182
03:21:11,790 --> 03:21:12,290
Okay.

3183
03:21:12,290 --> 03:21:12,690
Okay.

3184
03:21:13,090 --> 03:21:14,090
I accept that offer.

3185
03:21:14,559 --> 03:21:14,959
Right.

3186
03:21:17,809 --> 03:21:24,930
So this next one is to I don't even know how I even all right.

3187
03:21:24,930 --> 03:21:26,530
This is to do a fuck.

3188
03:21:26,629 --> 03:21:27,030
Okay.

3189
03:21:28,030 --> 03:21:30,629
This next game because we already know the tweets happening, right?

3190
03:21:30,629 --> 03:21:32,229
Like I'm not going to be like, well, check that out.

3191
03:21:32,229 --> 03:21:33,530
But okay, sure.

3192
03:21:33,629 --> 03:21:35,729
This next game and this is the final game.

3193
03:21:35,729 --> 03:21:36,229
This is it.

3194
03:21:36,329 --> 03:21:39,530
This is the final game is it is by the way, it's been a blast.

3195
03:21:39,530 --> 03:21:40,129
It's been a pleasure.

3196
03:21:40,530 --> 03:21:41,829
I've had a great time today.

3197
03:21:41,829 --> 03:21:42,930
It's been absolutely fun.

3198
03:21:42,930 --> 03:21:43,829
Fantastically fun.

3199
03:21:45,100 --> 03:21:53,129
This is to solely if I win is to remove remove the cat costume.

3200
03:21:55,040 --> 03:21:58,639
So you would be delivering milk as a mega milk made but without

3201
03:21:58,639 --> 03:21:59,840
the cat costume in this picture.

3202
03:21:59,840 --> 03:22:03,120
Now, are you wearing the mega milk shirt?

3203
03:22:05,170 --> 03:22:09,909
Um, it's really nailed down the T's in the eyes here.

3204
03:22:12,760 --> 03:22:14,260
I think I'd probably rather just be the cat.

3205
03:22:15,700 --> 03:22:20,260
Well, let's pick a poison here because look you you're down bad.

3206
03:22:20,260 --> 03:22:23,059
But hey, I want to help you refinance restructure.

3207
03:22:26,719 --> 03:22:30,319
That laugh was just like that was such like a perfect evil laugh.

3208
03:22:33,059 --> 03:22:35,260
I would love to help you restructure this now.

3209
03:22:35,260 --> 03:22:37,260
Let's let's just talk brass tacks.

3210
03:22:37,260 --> 03:22:43,459
Are we more scared of the cat or the milk because we're going

3211
03:22:43,459 --> 03:22:44,559
to have to pick a poison here.

3212
03:22:44,559 --> 03:22:46,659
We got to go down a road Robert Frost style.

3213
03:22:46,659 --> 03:22:53,690
We got to pick one now, you know is is a the lesser of two

3214
03:22:53,690 --> 03:22:59,549
evils or the evil or I think it's the evil or you do you see

3215
03:22:59,549 --> 03:23:01,549
my my vision of this image of this tweet.

3216
03:23:01,549 --> 03:23:05,350
It's delivering milk as a mega milk made with a cat costume.

3217
03:23:05,649 --> 03:23:07,649
It's it's it's got to it's got to be up there.

3218
03:23:08,450 --> 03:23:10,850
I mean this thing's going to be downloaded, you know, let me

3219
03:23:10,850 --> 03:23:12,750
just say that this is how this is going to be downloaded.

3220
03:23:12,750 --> 03:23:15,850
So I mean the amount of fan art that will come from this will

3221
03:23:15,850 --> 03:23:17,350
teach artists for years.

3222
03:23:18,280 --> 03:23:20,979
It's just like this is going to be the modern-day scream.

3223
03:23:20,979 --> 03:23:25,469
It's going to be recreated so many times I am down to just

3224
03:23:25,469 --> 03:23:28,670
let's just remove the cat in this next wager.

3225
03:23:28,670 --> 03:23:31,870
Let's just get rid of the cat and you are now just you just

3226
03:23:31,870 --> 03:23:34,569
wear a shirt that happens to say mega milk which which could

3227
03:23:34,569 --> 03:23:35,370
mean anything.

3228
03:23:37,549 --> 03:23:38,950
All right delivering almond milk.

3229
03:23:39,049 --> 03:23:39,250
All right.

3230
03:23:39,250 --> 03:23:42,780
What if I lose this something else that you can add?

3231
03:23:42,780 --> 03:23:46,959
I you're just giving me like oats which I very much appreciate

3232
03:23:46,959 --> 03:23:47,559
by the way.

3233
03:23:48,299 --> 03:23:52,420
That's that's what happens if you want if you lose unfortunately

3234
03:23:52,420 --> 03:23:52,920
the cat.

3235
03:23:53,489 --> 03:23:56,590
How about this cat if I lose if I lose this no more like oh

3236
03:23:56,590 --> 03:23:58,790
double down remember if I lose it's over.

3237
03:23:58,790 --> 03:23:59,190
That's it.

3238
03:23:59,690 --> 03:24:00,590
It's locked in.

3239
03:24:00,690 --> 03:24:02,090
How about yeah, I am down.

3240
03:24:02,190 --> 03:24:03,190
That's what I win.

3241
03:24:03,389 --> 03:24:07,799
If I win this is that it just it's almost like I'm able to

3242
03:24:07,799 --> 03:24:11,440
walk away from the table and it has to be done.

3243
03:24:11,440 --> 03:24:15,979
It's like we'll we'll just nod at each other in passing knowing

3244
03:24:15,979 --> 03:24:18,379
that the deal has been done and it's it's been written in

3245
03:24:18,379 --> 03:24:18,780
ink.

3246
03:24:18,979 --> 03:24:20,739
Okay, it's over.

3247
03:24:21,750 --> 03:24:22,049
Yeah.

3248
03:24:22,049 --> 03:24:24,649
So it you you pressed and fake prices.

3249
03:24:27,719 --> 03:24:29,620
So what wait what what was the next part?

3250
03:24:29,620 --> 03:24:33,719
I said if if I win the deals over call it done.

3251
03:24:33,719 --> 03:24:34,219
That's it.

3252
03:24:34,219 --> 03:24:36,959
We're going to be you know, nodding as we pass and fake

3253
03:24:36,959 --> 03:24:37,459
breasts.

3254
03:24:40,620 --> 03:24:42,219
No, I'll walk away from the table right now.

3255
03:24:44,200 --> 03:24:44,600
I'm kidding.

3256
03:24:44,799 --> 03:24:45,299
I'm kidding.

3257
03:24:45,299 --> 03:24:45,700
I'm kidding.

3258
03:24:45,700 --> 03:24:46,100
Come on.

3259
03:24:46,100 --> 03:24:47,700
We we can joke around.

3260
03:24:47,700 --> 03:24:53,870
You know, this this these keep getting we're getting more

3261
03:24:53,870 --> 03:24:55,770
and more and more things added.

3262
03:24:55,870 --> 03:24:56,170
Eventually.

3263
03:24:56,170 --> 03:24:56,670
What are you going to?

3264
03:24:56,670 --> 03:24:58,270
I'm going to have to put like something on my head like a

3265
03:24:58,270 --> 03:24:59,170
crown or something.

3266
03:24:59,170 --> 03:25:00,170
What what's next?

3267
03:25:00,170 --> 03:25:03,170
SpaceX ship about to launch.

3268
03:25:03,170 --> 03:25:06,069
All right with your adding creative character shit bald

3269
03:25:06,069 --> 03:25:06,670
head.

3270
03:25:08,290 --> 03:25:16,120
No, no, I actually am happy to wager cat for for deal being

3271
03:25:16,120 --> 03:25:16,719
done.

3272
03:25:19,280 --> 03:25:22,299
And that and then just and that's good for me.

3273
03:25:22,299 --> 03:25:22,700
And that's it.

3274
03:25:22,700 --> 03:25:23,100
And that's it.

3275
03:25:23,100 --> 03:25:24,100
And then that's it's over.

3276
03:25:24,479 --> 03:25:28,559
Yeah, this is just this is more of a give really giving me

3277
03:25:28,559 --> 03:25:29,159
it out.

3278
03:25:29,860 --> 03:25:30,959
It's kind of giving you it out.

3279
03:25:30,959 --> 03:25:31,659
It's also like ball.

3280
03:25:31,659 --> 03:25:32,260
Don't lie.

3281
03:25:32,260 --> 03:25:32,760
You know what I mean?

3282
03:25:33,860 --> 03:25:36,059
You know, I'm shooting the extra shot.

3283
03:25:36,059 --> 03:25:37,559
We're contesting it ball.

3284
03:25:37,559 --> 03:25:38,059
Don't lie.

3285
03:25:38,059 --> 03:25:39,760
If I win this one, then I mean, it's true.

3286
03:25:39,760 --> 03:25:40,559
It's there's nothing else.

3287
03:25:40,559 --> 03:25:43,459
You're just giving me an extra life here to basically go back

3288
03:25:43,459 --> 03:25:47,489
one of the layers of onions, but I but also if I win it's

3289
03:25:47,489 --> 03:25:49,989
like it's so reaffirmed that you couldn't argue it, which

3290
03:25:49,989 --> 03:25:51,590
is which is this is no argument.

3291
03:25:51,590 --> 03:25:52,489
It's like this is yeah.

3292
03:25:53,860 --> 03:25:54,159
All right.

3293
03:25:54,159 --> 03:25:54,659
Let's do it.

3294
03:25:57,180 --> 03:25:59,479
There's almost a meta that's formed right now.

3295
03:26:09,180 --> 03:26:11,479
Yeah, I don't I don't know what to do here.

3296
03:26:13,299 --> 03:26:15,100
I have no idea how to place my ships.

3297
03:26:47,620 --> 03:26:49,219
Everything looks so wrong to me.

3298
03:27:03,260 --> 03:27:05,059
I mean everything just looks so wrong.

3299
03:27:17,920 --> 03:27:18,719
This is crazy.

3300
03:27:43,260 --> 03:27:44,159
This is crazy.

3301
03:27:44,159 --> 03:27:55,329
But I think I'm happy with this now.

3302
03:27:55,329 --> 03:27:55,629
I am.

3303
03:27:55,729 --> 03:27:57,229
No, now I am.

3304
03:27:57,799 --> 03:27:58,799
No, now I am.

3305
03:28:02,290 --> 03:28:02,889
I'm happy with this.

3306
03:28:32,229 --> 03:28:34,659
Go I am.

3307
03:28:34,659 --> 03:28:36,059
I am panicking over here.

3308
03:28:36,059 --> 03:28:36,459
Not ready.

3309
03:29:06,629 --> 03:29:07,729
So hard to avoid.

3310
03:29:29,510 --> 03:29:29,809
Fuck it.

3311
03:29:29,809 --> 03:29:30,209
Whatever.

3312
03:29:38,079 --> 03:29:38,379
All right.

3313
03:29:38,379 --> 03:29:38,680
Fuck it.

3314
03:29:38,680 --> 03:29:39,079
Fuck it.

3315
03:29:39,079 --> 03:29:39,379
Fuck it.

3316
03:29:39,379 --> 03:29:39,780
Let's go.

3317
03:29:40,780 --> 03:29:41,479
Oh God.

3318
03:29:41,579 --> 03:29:41,780
All right.

3319
03:29:41,780 --> 03:29:42,280
Come on, baby.

3320
03:29:42,280 --> 03:29:42,479
Come on.

3321
03:29:42,479 --> 03:29:42,879
Give me tails.

3322
03:29:42,879 --> 03:29:43,479
Give me tails.

3323
03:29:46,139 --> 03:29:47,139
That's both of us, isn't it?

3324
03:29:47,879 --> 03:29:49,180
Yeah, but I'm silver.

3325
03:29:49,180 --> 03:29:52,299
You're bronze, right?

3326
03:29:52,299 --> 03:29:57,659
What I found to be one of the best strategies is this.

3327
03:30:01,620 --> 03:30:03,120
Not as good of a start for sure.

3328
03:30:04,219 --> 03:30:07,020
I did have a godlike start and it was a close game too.

3329
03:30:10,959 --> 03:30:11,459
Oof.

3330
03:30:11,459 --> 03:30:11,959
Oof.

3331
03:30:12,059 --> 03:30:13,459
Bit of a mind war we have here.

3332
03:30:13,459 --> 03:30:14,860
This is more mind sweeper than battleship.

3333
03:30:14,860 --> 03:30:15,360
It is.

3334
03:30:17,299 --> 03:30:18,600
He's more man than machine.

3335
03:30:18,799 --> 03:30:19,200
Damn it.

3336
03:30:28,319 --> 03:30:28,819
Come on.

3337
03:30:35,040 --> 03:30:35,540
Do that.

3338
03:30:37,040 --> 03:30:38,440
Just a couple of mines.

3339
03:30:38,440 --> 03:30:38,840
All right.

3340
03:30:38,940 --> 03:30:41,040
So you go in mind strategy here.

3341
03:30:41,639 --> 03:30:43,540
Well, it gives you two hits.

3342
03:30:43,940 --> 03:30:48,040
So anytime you do an airfield sweep, it's just like game over.

3343
03:31:01,379 --> 03:31:02,180
More mines.

3344
03:31:02,180 --> 03:31:03,780
You're really going with the mines here.

3345
03:31:04,180 --> 03:31:04,680
Mm-hmm.

3346
03:31:05,700 --> 03:31:06,200
Hmm.

3347
03:31:08,360 --> 03:31:09,959
It also fucks up your sonar.

3348
03:31:10,059 --> 03:31:11,860
I mean, yeah, it does.

3349
03:31:15,229 --> 03:31:16,030
It truly does.

3350
03:31:28,760 --> 03:31:30,059
There's so much meta.

3351
03:31:35,969 --> 03:31:38,370
What are you thinking of doing?

3352
03:31:40,180 --> 03:31:41,379
Where did you put that?

3353
03:31:41,379 --> 03:31:42,579
You son of a bitch.

3354
03:31:47,840 --> 03:31:49,239
This is the most tense.

3355
03:31:49,639 --> 03:31:52,340
Somebody you're looking over with a stack of $100 bills.

3356
03:31:52,639 --> 03:31:56,149
I've got like 50 cents on the table and I want I just want you

3357
03:31:56,149 --> 03:31:58,250
wiped out and you're just like, oh boy.

3358
03:31:58,250 --> 03:31:59,350
That was tricky.

3359
03:31:59,350 --> 03:32:00,649
Wow, tricky for that one.

3360
03:32:00,649 --> 03:32:02,149
And I'm just like, yeah, it was really tricky.

3361
03:32:02,149 --> 03:32:03,649
I got 50 cents.

3362
03:32:15,709 --> 03:32:20,020
Well, well, well, well, what do we have here?

3363
03:32:21,559 --> 03:32:21,959
Not there.

3364
03:32:25,879 --> 03:32:27,180
I'm just copying him.

3365
03:32:28,590 --> 03:32:31,489
He's once five straight games in a row.

3366
03:32:31,489 --> 03:32:33,489
Why would I not want to do what he's doing?

3367
03:32:38,420 --> 03:32:38,819
Okay.

3368
03:32:38,920 --> 03:32:39,420
All right.

3369
03:32:40,559 --> 03:32:41,360
Where are you going now?

3370
03:32:42,219 --> 03:32:43,120
You put a bomb over here.

3371
03:32:43,659 --> 03:32:44,059
I did.

3372
03:32:44,459 --> 03:32:54,260
Did there it is God my God.

3373
03:32:54,260 --> 03:32:55,559
That is so huge.

3374
03:32:55,659 --> 03:33:07,319
That's blessed thinking about putting a mine over there.

3375
03:33:10,020 --> 03:33:10,920
I knew it.

3376
03:33:11,520 --> 03:33:13,120
Devious devious.

3377
03:33:13,219 --> 03:33:13,620
Okay.

3378
03:33:13,719 --> 03:33:14,120
All right.

3379
03:33:14,629 --> 03:33:15,229
Let's do this.

3380
03:33:15,229 --> 03:33:16,729
Let's let's sweep this here.

3381
03:33:21,620 --> 03:33:23,819
What did you do up here?

3382
03:33:23,819 --> 03:33:24,319
Nothing.

3383
03:33:28,299 --> 03:33:32,459
So that that's either your L or more realistically some

3384
03:33:32,559 --> 03:33:33,059
hug boat.

3385
03:33:33,059 --> 03:33:41,610
That's just been did I just find your L?

3386
03:33:42,510 --> 03:33:43,709
Oh, I just found it.

3387
03:33:46,750 --> 03:33:47,450
How are we?

3388
03:33:49,819 --> 03:33:53,719
Oh my God, I just found your L perfectly.

3389
03:33:55,020 --> 03:33:56,520
I thought that was a minefield for sure.

3390
03:33:56,520 --> 03:33:56,819
Okay.

3391
03:33:56,920 --> 03:33:57,120
All right.

3392
03:33:57,120 --> 03:33:57,819
You're rich now though.

3393
03:33:57,819 --> 03:34:04,860
That's concerning my best bet, right?

3394
03:34:11,700 --> 03:34:14,299
I still don't have anything of yours even uncovered.

3395
03:34:15,290 --> 03:34:18,020
Well, you have a sweep over there.

3396
03:34:18,750 --> 03:34:36,139
Yeah, but why just airstrike right down the middle or just

3397
03:34:36,139 --> 03:34:38,739
airstrike over here because I'll know those eventually.

3398
03:34:44,010 --> 03:34:44,909
I think that's the play.

3399
03:34:46,540 --> 03:34:47,040
That's the play.

3400
03:34:52,639 --> 03:34:54,239
Oh, that is that was one of your twos.

3401
03:34:54,440 --> 03:34:55,739
That was one of my twos.

3402
03:34:59,959 --> 03:35:00,760
Oh, why does that?

3403
03:35:00,760 --> 03:35:02,459
Why is that even a thing that can happen?

3404
03:35:03,639 --> 03:35:04,440
What is this?

3405
03:35:04,540 --> 03:35:05,340
What happened?

3406
03:35:05,739 --> 03:35:08,440
My my random missile.

3407
03:35:09,139 --> 03:35:12,340
My spot which triggered you hitting me which could just

3408
03:35:12,340 --> 03:35:13,739
be a forever chain.

3409
03:35:13,940 --> 03:35:14,840
Oh, that's funny.

3410
03:35:15,959 --> 03:35:16,260
All right.

3411
03:35:16,260 --> 03:35:21,979
Well, I you have the two you didn't put two twos up here.

3412
03:35:21,979 --> 03:35:29,829
Did you damn it?

3413
03:35:30,299 --> 03:35:32,299
It's really hoping you'd go for row three.

3414
03:35:35,040 --> 03:35:41,280
I think you did you didn't I thought you did like a one

3415
03:35:41,280 --> 03:35:43,479
two just trying to be a weirdo like I like I would have

3416
03:35:43,479 --> 03:35:45,280
like you would have freaked me out or something.

3417
03:35:46,079 --> 03:35:48,479
No, no, none of that none of that shenanigans are you

3418
03:35:48,479 --> 03:35:53,809
you must be here just have to be are you serious?

3419
03:35:53,909 --> 03:35:54,510
No, man.

3420
03:35:55,659 --> 03:35:55,860
All right.

3421
03:35:55,860 --> 03:35:56,459
Let's do this.

3422
03:36:00,469 --> 03:36:01,270
Oh, okay.

3423
03:36:04,190 --> 03:36:04,690
All right.

3424
03:36:04,889 --> 03:36:05,489
All right.

3425
03:36:05,889 --> 03:36:09,659
I'm narrowing it down bit by bit inch by inch.

3426
03:36:10,959 --> 03:36:18,620
Oh you all right.

3427
03:36:18,819 --> 03:36:19,319
There you are.

3428
03:36:20,420 --> 03:36:21,319
Did find me.

3429
03:36:25,479 --> 03:36:26,479
Here's the real question though.

3430
03:36:26,479 --> 03:36:41,479
Is this your L or is this your your three your three?

3431
03:36:42,860 --> 03:36:45,459
Oh, this is a tight war right now.

3432
03:36:47,020 --> 03:37:00,670
Now here you are.

3433
03:37:02,590 --> 03:37:03,190
Here you are.

3434
03:37:04,510 --> 03:37:05,709
Say like such a villain.

3435
03:37:08,190 --> 03:37:08,790
Okay.

3436
03:37:11,899 --> 03:37:18,540
They are this could be your Tetris shape in the top left.

3437
03:37:19,110 --> 03:37:20,309
No, it can't be bottom, right?

3438
03:37:21,479 --> 03:37:21,780
Thank you.

3439
03:37:21,780 --> 03:37:23,719
Fuck fuck.

3440
03:37:24,020 --> 03:37:24,420
Thank you.

3441
03:37:25,049 --> 03:37:26,649
I've wasted eight turns on this one.

3442
03:37:30,719 --> 03:37:31,219
Damn it.

3443
03:37:31,979 --> 03:37:33,180
Let's do one of these though.

3444
03:37:51,229 --> 03:37:52,829
I'm on a sonar meta right now.

3445
03:37:52,829 --> 03:37:55,030
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

3446
03:37:55,129 --> 03:38:05,959
re re nice.

3447
03:38:05,959 --> 03:38:06,659
Nice.

3448
03:38:09,049 --> 03:38:09,350
Come on.

3449
03:38:09,350 --> 03:38:09,850
Give me something.

3450
03:38:22,829 --> 03:38:23,729
I know where you are now.

3451
03:38:24,110 --> 03:38:28,250
This is this is guaranteed all but lovely.

3452
03:38:28,350 --> 03:38:30,299
It's a good one to take down.

3453
03:38:30,399 --> 03:38:32,000
Now we have four over here.

3454
03:38:32,000 --> 03:38:36,260
So you placed a bomb up here did place a bomb up here.

3455
03:38:36,360 --> 03:38:39,899
But if we have three before that then it couldn't be here.

3456
03:38:40,700 --> 03:38:44,889
It would most likely have to have been four piece.

3457
03:38:45,559 --> 03:38:48,159
So this is guaranteed either way.

3458
03:39:04,020 --> 03:39:04,620
All right.

3459
03:39:06,620 --> 03:39:09,899
That happened to one of these.

3460
03:39:11,450 --> 03:39:11,950
All right.

3461
03:39:13,450 --> 03:39:16,350
Well, it's one of these two spaces because you just put a

3462
03:39:16,350 --> 03:39:17,450
bomb over here.

3463
03:39:18,489 --> 03:39:19,389
What could this even be?

3464
03:39:27,079 --> 03:39:27,680
That was stupid of me.

3465
03:39:27,680 --> 03:39:29,379
There's literally only one place I could have put the bomb.

3466
03:39:30,479 --> 03:39:31,479
But wait, hold on.

3467
03:39:31,879 --> 03:39:33,180
Could this just be it here?

3468
03:39:33,479 --> 03:39:33,979
I wonder.

3469
03:39:49,079 --> 03:39:49,479
Okay.

3470
03:39:49,780 --> 03:39:50,180
Fuck.

3471
03:39:50,180 --> 03:39:51,079
I gave it away.

3472
03:39:51,079 --> 03:39:51,680
I think I got you.

3473
03:39:52,510 --> 03:39:53,209
I think I got you here.

3474
03:39:53,209 --> 03:39:53,709
Hold on.

3475
03:39:57,520 --> 03:39:58,520
No, this could be anything.

3476
03:39:58,520 --> 03:39:59,319
This could be anything.

3477
03:39:59,319 --> 03:40:00,319
This could be your three.

3478
03:40:00,319 --> 03:40:01,020
This could be your two.

3479
03:40:01,020 --> 03:40:01,620
This could be anything.

3480
03:40:03,950 --> 03:40:04,350
Okay.

3481
03:40:04,649 --> 03:40:05,350
Is it the two?

3482
03:40:05,450 --> 03:40:05,850
Nope.

3483
03:40:07,379 --> 03:40:09,079
Now here's the tricky part though.

3484
03:40:09,809 --> 03:40:15,450
This could be your Tetris piece or could it not?

3485
03:40:15,450 --> 03:40:16,549
Is that I think this is your three.

3486
03:40:19,659 --> 03:40:21,059
Did you go this way or this way?

3487
03:40:26,159 --> 03:40:26,559
Mm-hmm.

3488
03:40:28,309 --> 03:40:32,010
The amount of stress I have right now is so unparalleled.

3489
03:40:32,309 --> 03:40:33,010
You went this way.

3490
03:40:34,100 --> 03:40:34,500
Okay.

3491
03:40:35,500 --> 03:40:35,899
Wait.

3492
03:40:36,540 --> 03:40:37,440
No, hold on.

3493
03:40:37,540 --> 03:40:39,040
I think this is your Tetris piece.

3494
03:40:39,040 --> 03:40:39,639
It's right here.

3495
03:40:39,639 --> 03:40:40,139
Isn't it?

3496
03:40:40,840 --> 03:40:41,340
Isn't it?

3497
03:40:42,110 --> 03:40:42,909
You can tell me.

3498
03:40:43,209 --> 03:40:44,809
My hair is crazy.

3499
03:41:05,930 --> 03:41:06,329
It is.

3500
03:41:06,329 --> 03:41:06,629
All right.

3501
03:41:06,629 --> 03:41:06,930
All right.

3502
03:41:06,930 --> 03:41:07,229
All right.

3503
03:41:07,229 --> 03:41:07,530
All right.

3504
03:41:07,530 --> 03:41:07,930
I got you.

3505
03:41:08,030 --> 03:41:08,430
I got you.

3506
03:41:08,430 --> 03:41:08,829
I got you.

3507
03:41:08,829 --> 03:41:09,229
I got you.

3508
03:41:10,319 --> 03:41:10,719
I got you.

3509
03:41:10,719 --> 03:41:11,020
Get me.

3510
03:41:12,379 --> 03:41:13,479
You did get me.

3511
03:41:13,479 --> 03:41:16,079
I'm now quite stressed.

3512
03:41:17,610 --> 03:41:19,309
You are in a good position though.

3513
03:41:19,309 --> 03:41:20,809
You've only you've got your two is.

3514
03:41:21,610 --> 03:41:22,809
Magically somewhere over here.

3515
03:41:23,110 --> 03:41:24,510
So let's see if I can do this.

3516
03:41:31,500 --> 03:41:31,899
Okay.

3517
03:41:32,600 --> 03:41:46,610
Shit really only one put your two right here.

3518
03:41:58,239 --> 03:41:58,940
That was the bomb.

3519
03:41:58,940 --> 03:42:00,139
There was three before.

3520
03:42:01,610 --> 03:42:03,110
There's a four piece remaining.

3521
03:42:03,110 --> 03:42:04,309
How are there three terrible?

3522
03:42:04,309 --> 03:42:05,709
Why people call me terrible one.

3523
03:42:06,010 --> 03:42:07,309
How are there three in here?

3524
03:42:08,200 --> 03:42:09,700
Did I I must have found two boats.

3525
03:42:09,700 --> 03:42:22,870
I must have pinged two boats because that's a two must

3526
03:42:22,969 --> 03:42:24,170
unless you put a bomb.

3527
03:43:06,000 --> 03:43:09,100
There was not a sound mind and Ludwig is taking advantage

3528
03:43:09,100 --> 03:43:09,600
of him.

3529
03:43:10,299 --> 03:43:11,000
What do you mean?

3530
03:43:11,000 --> 03:43:12,299
I thought that was stupid.

3531
03:43:18,280 --> 03:43:19,579
You just that was a lot of points.

3532
03:43:20,879 --> 03:43:23,180
Yeah, I think it's too late for the airstrike.

3533
03:43:28,170 --> 03:43:29,370
Where is this this?

3534
03:43:29,370 --> 03:43:35,090
Okay, this should have to be like over here.

3535
03:43:44,620 --> 03:43:47,219
I wonder if I wonder I wonder if it's down here.

3536
03:43:49,829 --> 03:43:52,930
On our and this is not maybe also not this one.

3537
03:43:53,030 --> 03:44:01,040
No, your two could just be anywhere.

3538
03:44:01,040 --> 03:44:01,739
That's the problem.

3539
03:44:03,159 --> 03:44:04,760
It could be anywhere.

3540
03:44:04,760 --> 03:44:10,260
Yeah, but the problem is if I'm gonna this I already hit

3541
03:44:10,260 --> 03:44:11,360
these two.

3542
03:44:11,360 --> 03:44:13,559
So I would realistically only be hitting like these three.

3543
03:44:16,340 --> 03:44:17,239
I'm going to sonar this one.

3544
03:44:17,909 --> 03:44:20,110
No, that's so no sonar this one.

3545
03:44:22,709 --> 03:44:23,510
Sonar this one.

3546
03:44:23,510 --> 03:44:27,450
No, I think I'm going to sonar this one.

3547
03:44:27,549 --> 03:44:28,549
I'm going for it bucket.

3548
03:44:32,649 --> 03:44:33,549
Oh bingo.

3549
03:44:33,649 --> 03:44:34,149
Okay.

3550
03:44:34,920 --> 03:44:38,219
So interestingly enough it ain't any of these ones.

3551
03:44:41,030 --> 03:44:41,829
Thank you down here.

3552
03:44:49,280 --> 03:44:49,780
All right.

3553
03:44:50,079 --> 03:44:52,579
Now is this the two or is this the Tetris piece?

3554
03:45:13,559 --> 03:45:14,559
What I do I fucked up.

3555
03:45:14,659 --> 03:45:15,260
How do I fuck up?

3556
03:45:15,899 --> 03:45:17,899
I thought there was a see you see he still has a two.

3557
03:45:21,540 --> 03:45:22,340
He still had a two.

3558
03:46:01,659 --> 03:46:04,059
If I think this through I might have it one.

3559
03:46:04,159 --> 03:46:04,659
Right here.

3560
03:46:11,950 --> 03:46:13,250
Is it right here?

3561
03:46:15,520 --> 03:46:18,719
Right because it has to be oh, this is a bomb.

3562
03:46:18,819 --> 03:46:21,719
This is either a bomb or it's right fucking here.

3563
03:46:27,440 --> 03:46:29,040
Well have it once bold you're so missing.

3564
03:46:30,479 --> 03:46:32,280
This is the sonar picks up bombs, right?

3565
03:46:38,680 --> 03:46:39,379
This is a bomb.

3566
03:46:39,879 --> 03:46:40,680
This is a bomb.

3567
03:46:40,879 --> 03:46:41,680
This is a bomb.

3568
03:46:41,780 --> 03:46:42,479
This is a bomb.

3569
03:46:42,680 --> 03:46:43,379
This is a bomb.

3570
03:46:43,780 --> 03:46:44,479
This is a bomb.

3571
03:46:44,680 --> 03:46:45,379
This is a bomb.

3572
03:46:45,579 --> 03:46:46,180
This is a bomb.

3573
03:46:47,379 --> 03:46:49,680
I fucking knew it was a bomb and I still clicked it.

3574
03:46:53,209 --> 03:46:54,010
Oh, no.

3575
03:46:55,549 --> 03:46:56,450
Oh, come on, please.

3576
03:46:56,950 --> 03:47:01,270
Oh, no.

3577
03:47:01,270 --> 03:47:02,469
That's fucking huge.

3578
03:47:02,569 --> 03:47:05,969
Yeah, how unlucky can you get?

3579
03:47:07,540 --> 03:47:08,840
Oh, that is so bad for me.

3580
03:47:14,799 --> 03:47:17,799
Oh, this is this is this is this is all down to this turn.

3581
03:47:17,799 --> 03:47:32,659
I think this is all just here we go.

3582
03:47:33,520 --> 03:47:34,520
Hmm.

3583
03:47:34,819 --> 03:47:35,219
Okay.

3584
03:47:35,319 --> 03:47:35,620
All right.

3585
03:47:35,620 --> 03:47:36,219
I need I need a win.

3586
03:47:36,219 --> 03:47:37,520
I need to win right now.

3587
03:47:38,020 --> 03:47:40,819
Now that this this this this has to be down.

3588
03:47:40,819 --> 03:48:37,100
It has to be oh, oh, I think there's only two possible locations.

3589
03:48:37,100 --> 03:48:40,719
No, I think there's only one.

3590
03:48:42,920 --> 03:48:46,110
I think it has to be here.

3591
03:49:00,010 --> 03:49:00,510
Jerma.

3592
03:49:02,840 --> 03:49:09,319
Oh, I will give you one last attempt.

3593
03:49:09,420 --> 03:49:11,520
What do we play another game?

3594
03:49:12,090 --> 03:49:14,309
No, that's not what I mean.

3595
03:49:16,540 --> 03:49:18,340
Wait, you're throwing on purpose.

3596
03:49:18,340 --> 03:49:25,370
I'm giving you one turn one turn one turn to save everything.

3597
03:49:25,370 --> 03:49:28,430
You cherish what a good luck.

3598
03:49:28,430 --> 03:49:29,430
What a good guy.

3599
03:49:31,250 --> 03:49:32,350
It's not going to be easy.

3600
03:49:36,950 --> 03:49:41,850
You have to guess right on which ship is where in what coordination

3601
03:49:41,850 --> 03:49:53,239
is it right here?

3602
03:49:53,540 --> 03:50:06,569
I'm going I'm going to the bottom right because if it's if it's

3603
03:50:06,569 --> 03:50:09,069
this is the I'll get good info, right?

3604
03:50:09,069 --> 03:50:09,969
This is info.

3605
03:50:10,600 --> 03:50:11,200
There's no info.

3606
03:50:11,200 --> 03:50:12,000
It's your last turn.

3607
03:50:12,100 --> 03:50:13,100
I know but this is info.

3608
03:50:13,989 --> 03:50:16,290
There's no oh unless you're doing like a major shot.

3609
03:50:16,290 --> 03:50:18,209
Yeah, that's this is info.

3610
03:50:26,139 --> 03:50:27,340
Oh, no, but you hit my thing.

3611
03:50:27,440 --> 03:50:38,579
What I got you.

3612
03:50:38,579 --> 03:50:38,979
I got you.

3613
03:50:38,979 --> 03:50:39,579
This is it.

3614
03:50:39,579 --> 03:50:43,379
I did it because you get me know because now all all the all

3615
03:50:43,379 --> 03:50:46,079
that's left is this is your Tetris piece, but which way is

3616
03:50:46,079 --> 03:50:46,780
it going?

3617
03:50:46,979 --> 03:50:47,979
Yeah, how do you know where it's going?

3618
03:50:48,079 --> 03:50:48,680
I don't know.

3619
03:50:50,209 --> 03:50:51,709
I have to sonar something.

3620
03:50:51,709 --> 03:50:53,110
I have to sonar this one here.

3621
03:50:53,409 --> 03:50:54,909
No, wait, take your time.

3622
03:50:54,909 --> 03:50:56,110
I don't want to mess with the cat.

3623
03:50:58,069 --> 03:50:59,469
So no this one or sonar this one.

3624
03:51:03,409 --> 03:51:04,610
I got a sonar the top right one.

3625
03:51:08,829 --> 03:51:10,329
This would be one two.

3626
03:51:10,329 --> 03:51:15,399
This would be three right or this one this one, right?

3627
03:51:16,549 --> 03:51:20,049
But this one because it was going down then it'd be one two.

3628
03:51:20,549 --> 03:51:23,649
It would be one if it was going this way if it was one two

3629
03:51:23,649 --> 03:51:24,350
bang bang.

3630
03:51:24,549 --> 03:51:28,139
That means this would just be one right.

3631
03:51:32,940 --> 03:51:33,639
That's that's this.

3632
03:51:33,639 --> 03:51:33,840
All right.

3633
03:51:33,840 --> 03:51:34,139
Here we go.

3634
03:51:34,139 --> 03:51:34,739
I'm going for it.

3635
03:51:36,049 --> 03:51:37,950
But could you flip it some weird way?

3636
03:51:39,930 --> 03:51:50,270
Oh, yeah, you can flip horizontally for what do you mean

3637
03:51:50,270 --> 03:51:58,579
for you have a bomb in every spot here.

3638
03:51:58,979 --> 03:52:03,559
It's one.

3639
03:52:03,559 --> 03:52:04,059
It's okay.

3640
03:52:04,059 --> 03:52:09,139
It's either one, two, three, four, one, two, three, four.

3641
03:52:09,239 --> 03:52:13,940
Oh my god bullet, but it has to be this one here has to has

3642
03:52:13,940 --> 03:52:17,940
to be guaranteed one below has to be this has to be it at

3643
03:52:17,940 --> 03:52:18,639
least this one.

3644
03:52:19,639 --> 03:52:20,639
It has to be.

3645
03:52:21,139 --> 03:52:24,979
At least it can't be a bomb here.

3646
03:52:24,979 --> 03:52:34,790
There's no way this would connect to anything but shit.

3647
03:52:34,790 --> 03:52:40,739
But what if it's these two as it could be this one in this

3648
03:52:40,739 --> 03:52:41,639
one, couldn't it?

3649
03:52:44,690 --> 03:52:46,290
Oh, no.

3650
03:52:49,870 --> 03:52:50,969
What would you have done?

3651
03:52:52,829 --> 03:52:54,530
I want you to trust yourself.

3652
03:52:54,530 --> 03:52:58,020
Maybe flip a coin, but you might have bombs here.

3653
03:52:59,209 --> 03:53:00,110
It could be one.

3654
03:53:00,110 --> 03:53:07,450
It could be bang bang or it could be just bang bang or or

3655
03:53:07,450 --> 03:53:08,250
it was rise.

3656
03:53:09,170 --> 03:53:09,969
Take a breath.

3657
03:53:10,370 --> 03:53:11,069
Take the shot.

3658
03:53:13,399 --> 03:53:14,600
I have a sonar here.

3659
03:53:15,459 --> 03:53:17,559
Zero, zero, zero, zero, zero.

3660
03:53:17,559 --> 03:53:18,059
I got you.

3661
03:53:18,459 --> 03:53:18,860
I got you.

3662
03:53:18,860 --> 03:53:19,360
I did it.

3663
03:53:20,879 --> 03:53:22,280
It's your zero IQ.

3664
03:53:22,280 --> 03:53:23,379
Gerber figured it out.

3665
03:53:23,379 --> 03:53:25,670
You're like God, right?

3666
03:53:25,969 --> 03:53:31,989
I'm so I don't know one, two, hold on zero, zero, zero,

3667
03:53:31,989 --> 03:53:33,889
zero, zero, zero, zero, zero.

3668
03:53:34,090 --> 03:53:35,389
So it has to be this one.

3669
03:53:49,500 --> 03:53:51,700
Thank you dad for letting me play the game.

3670
03:53:52,200 --> 03:53:57,600
Hey, look, I can't take $1,500 a catboy three tweets for

3671
03:53:57,700 --> 03:54:00,799
exclamation point seven houses on our first time hanging out.

3672
03:54:00,799 --> 03:54:01,799
That's that's too much.

3673
03:54:01,799 --> 03:54:02,000
All right.

3674
03:54:02,000 --> 03:54:03,600
We got to got to draw the line somewhere.

3675
03:54:04,530 --> 03:54:06,329
So what do I actually have to do now?

3676
03:54:07,270 --> 03:54:09,770
You owe one tweet, huh?

3677
03:54:10,270 --> 03:54:14,469
Where you are delivering almond milk in a mega milk costume.

3678
03:54:14,569 --> 03:54:15,069
Oh fuck.

3679
03:54:15,069 --> 03:54:16,069
That sucks.

3680
03:54:16,469 --> 03:54:18,370
And you also have to wear that on stream.

3681
03:54:18,770 --> 03:54:19,870
Oh, that sucks too.

3682
03:54:20,600 --> 03:54:27,979
And then you have to put I think $1,500 on a black at a

3683
03:54:27,979 --> 03:54:28,780
roulette table.

3684
03:54:28,780 --> 03:54:29,079
Oh my God.

3685
03:54:29,079 --> 03:54:29,879
That sucks.

3686
03:54:30,180 --> 03:54:30,979
I yeah.

3687
03:54:31,479 --> 03:54:31,879
Yeah.

3688
03:54:31,879 --> 03:54:34,379
So, you know today, what happened here?

3689
03:54:37,190 --> 03:54:40,290
So I don't I don't feel to the alternative would have just

3690
03:54:40,290 --> 03:54:41,290
the only thing you've won.

3691
03:54:41,290 --> 03:54:44,290
There is the removal of cat which which I feel I feel okay

3692
03:54:44,290 --> 03:54:44,690
with that.

3693
03:54:44,690 --> 03:54:45,190
Excuse me.

3694
03:54:45,190 --> 03:54:48,459
And like 70 bucks, 80 bucks, whatever it was.

3695
03:54:48,959 --> 03:54:49,459
That's true.

3696
03:54:49,459 --> 03:54:51,760
You did also win 80 bucks that you didn't wait.

3697
03:54:51,760 --> 03:54:52,959
What was how many subs of it?

3698
03:54:53,440 --> 03:54:54,540
Well, no, the subs are removed.

3699
03:54:54,540 --> 03:54:57,840
The subs are replaced with that with that with the with the

3700
03:54:57,840 --> 03:54:59,639
with the wager for the roulette.

3701
03:55:00,139 --> 03:55:00,940
So zero subs.

3702
03:55:01,670 --> 03:55:03,270
Wait, I thought I got no, no, it wasn't subs.

3703
03:55:03,270 --> 03:55:04,469
It was dollars, right?

3704
03:55:04,870 --> 03:55:10,079
$50 it was 96 subs and then it's been translated to the

3705
03:55:10,079 --> 03:55:10,979
casino bet.

3706
03:55:11,079 --> 03:55:11,879
Oh, okay.

3707
03:55:12,079 --> 03:55:13,379
So just give me a list of things.

3708
03:55:13,379 --> 03:55:16,079
I have to do I'll do I'll just I'll send you the list of

3709
03:55:16,079 --> 03:55:16,680
errands.

3710
03:55:18,979 --> 03:55:19,979
Look Ludwig.

3711
03:55:19,979 --> 03:55:20,879
What a hero.

3712
03:55:20,879 --> 03:55:22,879
What a streamer hero for me.

3713
03:55:23,809 --> 03:55:26,809
Yeah, let me tell you I've made enemies in both of our chats

3714
03:55:26,809 --> 03:55:27,309
from that.

3715
03:55:28,409 --> 03:55:29,610
Hey, but here's the thing though.

3716
03:55:30,709 --> 03:55:33,110
I could have really I could have fucked that up big time.

3717
03:55:33,209 --> 03:55:34,909
You could have easily fucked that up easily.

3718
03:55:35,780 --> 03:55:38,379
I think that that that explosion explosion you place in

3719
03:55:38,379 --> 03:55:39,979
the bottom right was that was a good explosion.

3720
03:55:40,379 --> 03:55:42,780
Because you could have decided to have placed that in the

3721
03:55:42,780 --> 03:55:44,780
top and that would have that would have been much tougher.

3722
03:55:46,139 --> 03:55:47,440
Well, that was fucking a lot of fun.

3723
03:55:48,209 --> 03:55:49,010
Yeah, I had a blast.

3724
03:55:49,010 --> 03:55:49,610
I had a blast.

3725
03:55:49,610 --> 03:55:50,709
Thanks for playing games.

3726
03:55:50,709 --> 03:55:52,309
I did not think we were going to do this for four hours,

3727
03:55:52,309 --> 03:55:53,110
but we did know.

3728
03:55:53,110 --> 03:55:55,110
Yeah, we were like we should get a list of games because

3729
03:55:55,110 --> 03:55:56,510
we're probably going to get a little bored.

3730
03:55:59,159 --> 03:56:00,159
No, absolutely not.

3731
03:56:00,159 --> 03:56:02,959
That was yeah, that was a pleasure and I'm glad you had

3732
03:56:03,059 --> 03:56:07,059
fun because even though I feel like we're leaving on a

3733
03:56:07,059 --> 03:56:10,860
note as if you had won you lost so much.

3734
03:56:10,860 --> 03:56:13,659
I very much lost a shitload.

3735
03:56:14,260 --> 03:56:17,540
Yeah, but I won the first like three games got really

3736
03:56:17,540 --> 03:56:19,940
overconfident and then lost five or six in a row.

3737
03:56:20,239 --> 03:56:24,440
It did feel for some reason like it was easier for me.

3738
03:56:24,440 --> 03:56:24,739
I don't know.

3739
03:56:24,739 --> 03:56:26,639
I think you just psych yourself out because even at the

3740
03:56:26,639 --> 03:56:29,139
end like it was mathematically proven with the sonar.

3741
03:56:29,340 --> 03:56:33,040
Yeah, I think just the stress your brain just melted.

3742
03:56:33,440 --> 03:56:38,120
Yeah, it does that but that was great.

3743
03:56:38,120 --> 03:56:41,420
That was a pleasure and I'll see you again Tuesday.

3744
03:56:41,620 --> 03:56:42,120
That's right.

3745
03:56:42,120 --> 03:56:45,020
I didn't even tell anybody I had nobody even knows what's

3746
03:56:45,020 --> 03:56:45,819
happening on Tuesday.

3747
03:56:45,819 --> 03:56:47,620
It is the first time I've streamed since last week.

3748
03:56:48,020 --> 03:56:48,420
Oh really?

3749
03:56:48,420 --> 03:56:50,120
Yeah, they don't know I've told my chat.

3750
03:56:50,219 --> 03:56:51,420
I don't think you've told your chat.

3751
03:56:51,420 --> 03:56:52,719
Would you like to go ahead and tell them what's going

3752
03:56:52,719 --> 03:56:53,420
to happen on Tuesday?

3753
03:56:53,420 --> 03:56:56,520
Oh, yeah, you want my words not your I can do my words.

3754
03:56:56,520 --> 03:56:58,020
Yeah, but if you do your event.

3755
03:56:58,559 --> 03:57:03,159
Yeah, this this Tuesday, I put $5,000 on the line for

3756
03:57:03,159 --> 03:57:06,459
a 12 streamer Mario Kart tournament.

3757
03:57:06,959 --> 03:57:09,260
It's going to be about two hours starting at 6 p.m.

3758
03:57:09,260 --> 03:57:12,860
Pacific and it features myself.

3759
03:57:12,860 --> 03:57:16,159
Jerma cutie Connor simply ms.

3760
03:57:16,159 --> 03:57:20,959
Kiff Clint mango XQC Northern Lion moist critical and in

3761
03:57:20,959 --> 03:57:21,959
a mystery guest meaning.

3762
03:57:21,959 --> 03:57:26,079
I just I haven't filled a slot yet, but but that's it.

3763
03:57:26,079 --> 03:57:27,079
That's that's this Tuesday.

3764
03:57:27,079 --> 03:57:29,079
It's a mar the switch Mario Kart.

3765
03:57:29,379 --> 03:57:30,680
It is the switch Mario Kart.

3766
03:57:30,680 --> 03:57:33,180
So you'll need a you'll need that game and to capture it

3767
03:57:33,180 --> 03:57:34,780
which I think you you got that already, right?

3768
03:57:34,780 --> 03:57:34,979
Yeah.

3769
03:57:34,979 --> 03:57:35,479
Yeah, I got it.

3770
03:57:36,860 --> 03:57:38,760
But yeah, that's that's that's Tuesday at 6.

3771
03:57:38,760 --> 03:57:43,190
It should be like a about a two hour session and then

3772
03:57:43,489 --> 03:57:44,389
then there'll be winners.

3773
03:57:44,590 --> 03:57:46,090
Yeah, I'm I'm ready to go.

03:57:46,090 --> 03:57:47,989
I'm actually not very I'm not bad at that game.

03:57:48,879 --> 03:57:50,780
I am pretty bad.

3776
03:57:50,780 --> 03:57:53,780
So I don't expect myself to place well, but I think the

3777
03:57:53,780 --> 03:57:56,959
the favorites going in are definitely Clint and Northern

3778
03:57:56,959 --> 03:57:59,760
Lion because all that man does is just win shit just wins.

3779
03:57:59,760 --> 03:58:01,360
He just he just wins things.

3780
03:58:01,360 --> 03:58:02,059
That's what he does.

3781
03:58:02,459 --> 03:58:03,159
He's a winner.

3782
03:58:03,159 --> 03:58:05,959
He's a winner in a in a bald man's body.

3783
03:58:07,229 --> 03:58:11,159
Hey, what was we talking about like, you know, just he's

3784
03:58:11,159 --> 03:58:13,709
a winner, but he took one out.

3785
03:58:13,709 --> 03:58:16,739
He just thought that you I mean your hair is looking great.

3786
03:58:16,739 --> 03:58:19,280

I'll be balded for you.

3792
03:58:23,780 --> 03:58:26,280
Do you think if it if you feel like it's coming you take

3793
03:58:26,280 --> 03:58:26,879
Propecia?

3794
03:58:27,280 --> 03:58:31,969
No, I'll just drink some extra green tea and I eat somebody

3795
03:58:31,969 --> 03:58:32,870

3796
03:58:32,870 --> 03:58:33,370
You'll be fine.

3797
03:58:33,870 --> 03:58:35,370
Yeah, me.

3798
03:58:35,370 --> 03:58:37,670
I would have a existential crisis when it's coming because

3799
03:58:37,670 --> 03:58:38,670
both my grandparents are bald.

3800
03:58:38,670 --> 03:58:39,370
It is coming.

3801
03:58:39,670 --> 03:58:40,170
I know me too.

3802
03:58:41,870 --> 03:58:43,469
It's gonna happen in like the next probably three or four

3803
03:58:43,469 --> 03:58:43,870
years.

3804
03:58:44,270 --> 03:58:45,170
I'm gonna be 40.

3805
03:58:45,170 --> 03:58:46,969
I'll be 40 in like less than five years guys.

3806
03:58:46,969 --> 03:58:47,569
What are you talking about?

3807
03:58:47,569 --> 03:58:49,870
Yeah, five years is a long time.

3808
03:58:49,870 --> 03:58:50,469
All right.

3809
03:58:50,469 --> 03:58:54,370
And look, you know, this is 40 40 year old Virgin.

3810
03:58:54,370 --> 03:58:55,469
It's that's a hot year.

3811
03:58:55,469 --> 03:58:56,469
People like that year.

3812
03:59:00,309 --> 03:59:00,909
Excuse me.

3813
03:59:01,309 --> 03:59:01,909
What do you wrote?

3814
03:59:02,209 --> 03:59:02,709
Excuse me.

3815
03:59:04,700 --> 03:59:05,000
Yeah.

3816
03:59:05,000 --> 03:59:05,899
Yes 40.

3817
03:59:08,040 --> 03:59:09,840
You just call me a virgin.

3818
03:59:10,540 --> 03:59:12,840
No, I'm saying that like it's a popular like, you know,

3819
03:59:12,840 --> 03:59:15,540
how like when you turn 22, you're like, oh Taylor

3820

I'm feeling 22 40.

3821
03:59:17,639 --> 03:59:20,540
It has so many exciting things that come along with it.

3822
03:59:20,540 --> 03:59:24,040
Like the movie the 40 year old Virgin is it omen to 40

3823
03:59:24,040 --> 03:59:30,819
year olds or who are virgins with the movies about it's

3824
03:59:30,819 --> 03:59:31,520
a footnote.

3825
03:59:31,520 --> 03:59:32,219
It's a footnote.

3826
03:59:32,219 --> 03:59:35,719
It's more so I think Virgin comes up 2000 times in the

3827
03:59:35,719 --> 03:59:36,219
script.

3828
03:59:36,719 --> 03:59:40,520
It's mostly just a vehicle for talking about the beauty

3829
03:59:40,520 --> 03:59:43,719
of aging more so than about virginity, which is which

3830
03:59:43,719 --> 03:59:44,520
is a beautiful thing.

3831
03:59:44,520 --> 03:59:45,620
And it's in its own, right?

3832
03:59:46,120 --> 03:59:48,579
For virginity.

3833
03:59:51,190 --> 03:59:51,790
All right, man.

3834
03:59:51,989 --> 03:59:53,090
It's been a fucking pleasure.

3835
03:59:53,489 --> 03:59:55,790
This is the first time we ever like hung out on stream.

3836
03:59:56,290 --> 03:59:57,290
Yeah, it's a blast.

3837
03:59:57,389 --> 04:00:00,489
And and now we've definitely set up one more hangout

3838
04:00:00,489 --> 04:00:02,690
and at some point I'm going to knock on your door

3839
04:00:02,690 --> 04:00:05,590
with far too expensive bidet for your asshole.

3840
04:00:05,590 --> 04:00:07,889
I can't wait to spray water into my ass.

3841
04:00:10,030 --> 04:00:10,629
It'll be clipped.

3842
04:00:12,819 --> 04:00:13,719
Not live though.

3843
04:00:13,920 --> 04:00:14,920
Oh God.

3844
04:00:15,319 --> 04:00:15,920
Oh God.

3845
04:00:16,319 --> 04:00:17,620
Yeah, I'll see you on Tuesday.

3846
04:00:18,120 --> 04:00:18,420
But all right.

3847
04:00:18,420 --> 04:00:18,920
Yeah, I'll see you.

3848
04:00:18,920 --> 04:00:19,219
I'll see you.

3849
04:00:19,219 --> 04:00:19,920
Have a good rest of your day.

3850
04:00:20,020 --> 04:00:20,819
Yeah, take care man.

3851
04:00:20,819 --> 04:00:21,319
Thanks for playing.

3852
04:00:21,920 --> 04:00:22,120
All right.

3853
04:00:22,120 --> 04:00:22,219
Bye.

3854
04:00:22,219 --> 04:00:22,420
Bye.

3855
04:00:24,659 --> 04:00:25,260
That was a lot of fun.

3856
04:00:28,079 --> 04:00:29,979
Yeah, when we first turned the stream on we were like,

3857
04:00:29,979 --> 04:00:31,879
oh yeah, maybe we'll play like Battleship for like,

3858
04:00:31,879 --> 04:00:32,079
I don't know.

3859
04:00:32,079 --> 04:00:33,180
We like 40 minutes.

3860
04:00:34,280 --> 04:00:36,579
We like 30 minutes maybe a tops.

3861
04:00:37,079 --> 04:00:37,879
That was a lot of fun.

3862
04:00:40,700 --> 04:00:41,700
Have to do a bunch of stuff.

3863
04:00:41,700 --> 04:00:42,899
Why does it always end up like this?

3864
04:00:44,059 --> 04:00:46,059
Anytime this competition I always like end up like

3865
04:00:46,159 --> 04:00:53,190
dressing up in a costume that happens every time I'll

3866
04:00:53,190 --> 04:00:54,989
figure out what the what how those tweets are going

3867
04:00:54,989 --> 04:00:55,489
to happen.

3868
04:00:56,190 --> 04:00:58,190
I have to like he's got to get this shirt.

3869
04:00:58,190 --> 04:00:59,889
If that's the shirt you want we got we got some

3870
04:00:59,889 --> 04:01:03,350
stuff to do but that's a perfect opportunity for me

3871
04:01:03,350 --> 04:01:03,750
to stop.

3872
04:01:04,739 --> 04:01:06,639
That was Ludwig if you don't know.

3873
04:01:06,639 --> 04:01:08,639
I mean, how could you not know Ludwig at this point?

3874
04:01:09,729 --> 04:01:14,010
He's hilarious fucking top 10 streamer.

3875
04:01:14,010 --> 04:01:16,510
He's probably probably in my top five at least of all

3876
04:01:16,510 --> 04:01:19,200
streamers will follow him if you don't which I don't

3877
04:01:19,200 --> 04:01:25,610
know how you don't but yeah, well, I'll see you guys

3878
04:01:25,610 --> 04:01:26,209
on Tuesday.

3879
04:01:26,209 --> 04:01:27,110
I'll be streaming on Tuesday.

3880
04:01:27,510 --> 04:01:29,209
I'll probably be streaming my perspective from the

3881
04:01:29,209 --> 04:01:30,309
Mario Kart Tournament.

3882
04:01:31,280 --> 04:01:33,280
I have some practicing to do so I'm going to be

3883
04:01:33,280 --> 04:01:36,780
streaming because I haven't I don't never streamed

3884
04:01:36,780 --> 04:01:37,479
Mario Kart.

3885
04:01:38,079 --> 04:01:39,079
So we'll see how that goes.

3886
04:01:39,379 --> 04:01:46,510
I need practice but is Ludwig still going to stream

3887
04:01:46,510 --> 04:01:55,909
or is he ending I think we're ending right?

3888
04:02:02,700 --> 04:02:03,200
That was a lot of fun.

3889
04:02:03,200 --> 04:02:03,700
Yeah, it was.

3890
04:02:07,719 --> 04:02:08,620
Thank you for the subs by the way.

3891
04:02:08,620 --> 04:02:10,719
I didn't really pay I would kind of locked in my

3892
04:02:10,719 --> 04:02:16,120
brain was kind of locked in to you know, everything

3893
04:02:16,120 --> 04:02:17,120
that going on on the screen.

3894
04:02:20,940 --> 04:02:25,840

Oh, we all know how that's that's a no.

3901

tag on Twitch.

Yeah, what the fuck is going on there?

3911
04:03:18,079 --> 04:03:20,579
I feel like we gave that just enough attention to

3912
04:03:20,579 --> 04:03:21,280
be confused.

3913
04:03:27,610 --> 04:03:29,110
Let's get the raid going.

04:03:32,860 --> 04:03:33,260

Bye stinking man.

3918
04:04:01,610 --> 04:04:02,909
Music really should not still be on.

3919

There we go.
