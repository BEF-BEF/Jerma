00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:13,859
Hello. Good afternoon. My name, if I may present myself, is Mixy. Nice to finally meet you face to

2
00:00:13,859 --> 00:00:36,869
face. Really? Hold on. Did you make a 3D movie maker reference and you see minus two? Really guys?

3
00:00:36,869 --> 00:00:47,820
That's interesting. I wonder if uh that's odd. I really thought that was gonna hit. Well anyways,

4
00:00:47,820 --> 00:01:01,780
hi welcome. Uh we are at the point of the stream when we do Sam and Max. This will be the final

5
00:01:02,899 --> 00:01:10,969
Sam and Max themed streams. After season three, I have no plans on doing the rest of Sam and Max,

6
00:01:10,969 --> 00:01:14,890
all the other games that they have. There's no plan to do that. But if I started season one,

7
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:19,930
I want to do season two and season three. And that's what we're gonna do. After this,

8
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:27,500
you might not see it again because I know that there is at least one or two other games in this

9
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:34,299
franchise. But there are a couple other things to talk about before we get started.

10
00:01:35,609 --> 00:01:46,700
First thing to talk about is we have some things to watch. We have two videos that from yesterday

11
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:56,230
that I want to show on the screen. We'll just wait. Let me just give me a minute. Let people

12
00:01:56,230 --> 00:02:49,189
trickle in and I'll be with you very shortly. Two minutes. Okay so this first one we're gonna watch

13
00:02:51,030 --> 00:03:00,969
is from uh it's time for slime. This is called uh German DOS. Let's go ahead and get it on the

14
00:03:00,969 --> 00:03:10,060
screen for you. Uh chunky baloney just came in with 10 community subs. Holy shit. Thank you so much.

16
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:22,969

23
00:04:27,129 --> 00:04:33,620
All right here we go. I actually think I can just do this. Yeah I have this from yesterday.

30
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:55,379
We're about to watch the movie. You guys are sitting in your theater seats and you're like

31
00:05:55,379 --> 00:06:10,230
you're taking more money out. It's like the movies we already paid for. Big Marsh 10 community subs.

32
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:18,870
Do not sub me. This is not my good account. No shit I gotta come and I gotta take my like mask off.

33
00:06:21,139 --> 00:06:31,259
Oh my god. These are these are I gotta put my good shoes on. I got my smurf what is it is

00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:20,550
even started. So thank you guys. See the real thing I'm not even gonna give you this idea.

40
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:28,230
If I give you this idea that would be that would be not good for me. Back in five community subs.

41
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:36,949
Nintendo got a community sub. Are you serious? Dude Nintendo's subbing to me? That's fucking oh wow.

42
00:07:36,949 --> 00:07:48,730
I can't believe it. Nintendo is not in the chat. You can give a community sub to anybody. Are they

43
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:58,759
here? Nintendo liars. Sometimes you have to check. What if they were like scouting me out to do like

44
00:07:58,759 --> 00:08:08,420
a I don't know like a Super Mario sponsorship or something. It could happen. All right here we go.

45
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:14,199
That was from back in Let's Go. Let's watch this video. This is called Jerma Dos. Are you ready? One

46
00:08:17,449 --> 00:09:40,820
two three. No porn games. The table. What did that say? Of course it has to end on that.

47
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:53,110
It has to end on that. What did the opposite say? Hold on. I clocked you rooming at 32 over the limit. I hate

48
00:09:53,110 --> 00:10:04,700
to do it but I'm gonna have to write you up a ticket. Okay here we go. That face. Speaking of movies

49
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:13,659
that is what it looks like in the dark when you are talking and somebody in front of you looks

50
00:10:13,659 --> 00:10:18,940
behind to try to essentially tell you. That's like a shut the fuck up face. That's like a what are

51
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:39,639
you really doing this face. That's what it looks like in the dark. Hold on yeah it's like this.

52
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:47,220
Here comes like the climax of the movie. Oh my god here he comes. I can't say any I can't make

53
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:55,190
a pretend climax because somebody will say it's a spoiler for some movie. Like right now the person

54
00:10:55,190 --> 00:11:01,429
is describing their love for the other character and they're about to like have a big kiss moment.

55
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:31,460
They're about to kiss on screen and then they just go and they turn back around. Nobody talks like

56
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:37,779
shit anymore. Have you noticed that? I don't know what it used to be. You'd be sitting in a movie

57
00:11:37,779 --> 00:11:43,980
theater and somebody would be like shit shut up. No I once last year heard somebody scream

58
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:50,139
at a movie theater before. I've been to a bunch of movies in the last few years and I've not heard

59
00:11:50,139 --> 00:12:00,490
it. I mean I've I've I've done it a few times. I mean but that's me doing that. Am I the guy now?

60
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:14,059
I don't hear other people do it. It's just me. Right okay. Oh shit I got too old. All right here

61
00:12:14,059 --> 00:12:20,980
comes the next one. The next one is another. It's an animation from Googly Gareth. They passed the

62
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:30,860
theater yelling torch to you. Maybe they did. No I don't want to yell. I don't yell in movie theaters.

63
00:12:31,419 --> 00:12:45,610
Who do you think I am? I yell after the movie's over. I clap at the credits. All right here we go.

64
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:54,330
This is called German animated streaming superstar. Actually let's just do this.

65
00:12:54,330 --> 00:13:12,899
Let's get rid of the white background here. There we go. Okay all right ready. This is called

66
00:13:12,899 --> 00:13:18,100
streaming superstar. Three two one let's go. I can't even beat a b-list. Well it doesn't matter.

67
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:25,659
That's not my style. That's not my style. I'm not gonna. I don't do cell phone commercials.

68
00:13:25,659 --> 00:13:39,559
You see how good my other commercials went with a toothpaste? Wash your teeth if you want. Not go

69
00:13:39,559 --> 00:13:45,659
to fucking jail kids. Nobody can beat me in those. I'm so much more popular than all these people.

70
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:49,340
You think I care about this guy with a pegasus commercial with a shitty car? Have you seen my

71
00:13:49,340 --> 00:14:07,110
germ commercial? It's 10 times better. Toilet sheriff. It's high noon for gamers. Get germs.

72
00:14:07,909 --> 00:14:12,710
I remember the deodorant commercial. I sold that. You know how many copies of the deodorant were

73
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:29,559
sold? You know how many copies were sold? 25,000 in one day. They're holding me hostage and making

74
00:14:29,559 --> 00:14:37,259
me film these commercials. So go take your car that like 10 people bought and break. I'm the

75
00:14:37,259 --> 00:14:42,940
important one here. Name something you need a lot of if you have a large family. I swear to god

76
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:50,779
if this answer is love I'm gonna put a hole through my screen. Don't fucking be love.

77
00:14:50,779 --> 00:14:55,740
You already got the cheeky answer in there. Who's the one person that wrote love? And like you know

78
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:58,779
you know when they asked and they said love and they winked it's gonna be love.

79
00:15:00,539 --> 00:15:07,429
Yeah oh yeah love you know. Wink. One person. It's gonna be one. One person. Fucking assholes.

80
00:15:07,429 --> 00:15:12,309
Oh yeah you need lots of patience. You need lots of love. We're three people that said this.

81
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:16,710
We like said it and then grabbed the person like on the shoulder and we're like hey you know what

82
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:20,950
I mean love and then they like tripped and dropped their fucking coffee and the rest of their day

83
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:25,029
sucked. They like stepped in a fucking huge puddle after they said that. They were like oh yeah love

84
00:15:25,029 --> 00:15:28,629
wink. Thank you for your time. Yeah I'll see you later. Thank oh yeah I gave you some good answers

85
00:15:28,629 --> 00:15:32,389
some really specific shitty ones. Yeah see you later and they turn and fucking go in the puddle

86
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:35,750
like they fucking goes all over their fucking pants and shit and their coffee goes everywhere

87
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:40,389
and the rest of their day was terrible. All right name a real or fictional person with Grant

88
00:15:40,389 --> 00:15:47,210
and his or her name. Hugh Grant. No Grant uh it was the president. What was the president's name?

89
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:54,649
The president. Uh Grantly. No he's on the fucking $50 bill. What's his name? Quick.

90
00:15:56,090 --> 00:16:02,340
What's his name? Alexander Van Grant? Alexander Grant? Who's the guy? Who's the president?

91
00:16:03,159 --> 00:16:14,019
Ulysses Grant? Yes Ulysses Grant. Shit. How do you spell Ulysses?

92
00:16:14,659 --> 00:16:21,210
Fuck it. We're doing Hugh Grant. Wait what? I gotta look this up right now. How do I look?

93
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:25,529
I'm just gonna type it into Google right now. You guys are gonna be too far behind. Ulysses.

94
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:34,330
U-L-Y? Ulysses Grant. Oh shit that's I.

95
00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:48,730
I who? Oh my god. He's gonna do Ulysses. He's gonna do Ulysses. Damn it.

96
00:16:49,049 --> 00:17:00,179
Do you want to see the category? Here goes fictional character. Donald Duck.

97
00:17:00,179 --> 00:17:05,380
Donald Duck. Donald Duck. Donald Duck. Donald Duck. Donald Duck. Donald Duck. Donald Duck.

98
00:17:06,019 --> 00:17:13,140
That's Donald Duck. Donald fucking Duck.

99
00:17:38,619 --> 00:17:47,299
What a shitty ending. Ah that was those are fucking great. That was called a streaming superstar

100
00:17:48,259 --> 00:17:59,480
by Googly Gareth. A very talented animator. I'm not I'm not like that you know. This is this

101
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:04,599
specific eclipse that I take it of of moments where I you know I have a little bit of trouble

102
00:18:04,599 --> 00:18:09,289
but it's not like that all the time. If you're new to the channel it's not really it's not like

103
00:18:09,289 --> 00:18:17,130
that all the time. It's only like that like sometimes. If a stream is like seven or eight

104
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:21,289
hours I feel like four hours is that. That's not even 40 percent. That's like that's a half.

105
00:18:26,809 --> 00:18:37,690
It's it's only when he's talking. It's funnily enough 40 to 50 percent of the stream probably

106
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:45,000
is me talking. The other 50 60 percent is like game stuff and stuff on the screen. So you know

107
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:54,039
you're probably right. Anyways those are two very very very very funny very interesting videos

108
00:18:54,039 --> 00:18:58,359
back to back. We are going to move on from that. We're going to do we're going to start Sam and

109
00:18:58,359 --> 00:19:09,400
Max season three. You have to have a high enough percentage to be a C plus streamer.

110
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:15,579
I'll take a C plus. I know it's B minus. I was downgraded. What is it? What's it on social

111
00:19:15,579 --> 00:19:20,250
blade right now? Is it did I get it? I haven't checked this in a long time actually. What is it?

112
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:37,829
What's my like twitch social blade right now? What do I have for grade? Oh come on man. That's a B

113
00:19:37,829 --> 00:19:54,230
plus. It used to be B minus. Oh I'm happy about that. Oh this is not an intro anymore. Hey look

114
00:19:54,230 --> 00:20:02,549
at that. Sam and Max. So again we're going to play this for that's what we're going to do today.

115
00:20:02,549 --> 00:20:07,369
Tomorrow by the way Star and I are going to play something. We don't know what it is. It's going

116
00:20:07,369 --> 00:20:12,809
to be a mystery game. We both actually don't know what the game is. We haven't talked. All I know is

117
00:20:12,809 --> 00:20:18,200
that we're going to play something together. I'm sure we'll probably figure that out in like an

118
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:27,349
hour before the stream. So I'll see you tomorrow. No no no no I'm not leaving yet. We'll do that

119
00:20:27,349 --> 00:20:36,140
tomorrow. But for today we're going to do Sam and Max and let's watch two videos and end the

120
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:47,779
stream after 20 minutes. Speaking of stuff happening on the stream KXZ gave $50. Thank you

121
00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:54,299
KXZ for your 50 bucks and they say hope you're doing well Jerma. Always a good day when that

122
00:20:54,299 --> 00:21:01,319
live notification pops up. Thank you. That's a lot of money. You've given a lot of money over the

123
00:21:01,319 --> 00:21:25,720
years. Wait is there another video? Is it a third? Was there a third video? This looks like a meme

124
00:21:25,720 --> 00:22:03,160
video. Is this a meme video? Is this a meme video? Okay is this is this safe for stream? No yes yes

125
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:09,930
yes yes yes okay all right all right of course it is. All right we're gonna watch two we're gonna

126
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:15,349
watch two more videos. All right this is it. This is it. No more videos after this.

127
00:22:15,349 --> 00:22:41,579
There's no more videos. We're gonna play Sam and Max. I don't I don't want to skip that out.

128
00:22:42,299 --> 00:22:45,609
All right there's no more videos after this.

129
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,559
Is this am I in this?

130
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:48,759
I'm not even in that video. Why did I just watch this?

131
00:23:55,240 --> 00:24:07,140
All right thanks for the video. That was an interesting video. Let's keep going. Let's watch

Subscribe. Subscribe to that. I'm not I haven't been logged into YouTube in like fucking four

138
00:24:58,009 --> 00:25:04,650
years. I can't. I don't I don't I have no login. All right let's go. Sam and Max.

139
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:21,349
The forever delayed Sam and Max stream. Let's get it over here. All right. Welcome to Sam and Max.

140
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:31,369
Enjoy your stay here. What? New game. I don't know how loud this is going to be.

141
00:25:31,369 --> 00:25:42,380
Prepare yourself. How is it? Is it all right? Is it good? Too loud. Is it too loud?

142
00:25:43,819 --> 00:25:55,660
I I can't see it over here. I need a mod. It's live? In all the universe the only power beyond

143
00:25:55,660 --> 00:26:05,700
the mind's comprehension is the power to comprehend the power of the mind. If any one of us could

144
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:12,819
unlock this terrible power would we use it to explore the mysteries of the infinite or would

145
00:26:12,819 --> 00:26:27,930
we use it to destroy? Yes. Tremble earthlings. Tremble before the might of General Scutafi.

146
00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:38,730
You know Sam Skunk Ape may be a tool but he brings a refreshingly childlike glee to his work.

147
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:48,170
All right I'm here Max. It's hard to stay mad at this guy.

148
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:59,700
Miss Sam and Max stop the dreadnoughts.

149
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:13,700
I will destroy you and then dominate the entire galaxy.

150
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:22,740
Wait. Okay yeah I can. I didn't know if I was gonna skip it accidentally or not.

151
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:37,460
I didn't know. Okay I think we're good. Which one of us is the fuzzy one? Better? It's a familiar

152
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:45,829
tale. A space gorilla pitted against a canine detective and a sociopathic bunny with psychic

153
00:27:45,829 --> 00:27:55,349
powers. But my friends this story is different. In this story you are in control. Only you can

154
00:27:55,349 --> 00:28:05,220
release our heroes. General Scunk Ape's bizarre space suit. A quest to bring the victor to space

155
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:15,450
justice. Let's begin the tour. I knew somebody was gonna say it. One person said it. We could

156
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:20,569
just reach my gun. We could administer an old school freelance police style beat down to that

157
00:28:20,569 --> 00:28:26,970
guy. I can't wait to get my stinking paws on that damn dirty ape. Simmer down Max. Check out

158
00:28:26,970 --> 00:28:31,609
stinky cell phone. We're gonna need that and your creepy new brain powers to get out of this cage.

159
00:28:31,609 --> 00:28:40,700
Gotta get cell phone. Whoa whoa whoa 3D. All right you can switch you can switch control between Sam

160
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:46,539
and Max by clicking on the freelance police badge in the corner of your screen. Try switching to Max

161
00:28:46,539 --> 00:29:01,130
to use his psychic powers. Okay what why does Max have psychic powers in this one? You are now inside

162
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:08,490
the dankest recesses of Max's mind where you can attempt to control his horrible psychic abilities

163
00:29:08,569 --> 00:29:16,089
unlocked by the toys of power. Okay when inside Max's brain you can look around by clicking and

164
00:29:16,089 --> 00:29:22,089
dragging the mouse over using the WASD keys. To activate Max's teleportation power click on the

165
00:29:22,089 --> 00:29:30,950
toy telephone. Okay well done my friends now select a phone number that Max has memorized

166
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:38,069
to teleport himself and his very long-time companion to that location and also Sam.

167
00:29:39,670 --> 00:29:43,910
The toy phone has a button for each of the phone numbers Max has memorized. Click on the button

168
00:29:43,910 --> 00:29:54,549
with stinky's picture to teleport to her cell phone. This is a joke you think right?

169
00:29:55,349 --> 00:30:05,609
We have to do that every time. It's the freelance police. Oh baby I've missed you.

170
00:30:05,769 --> 00:30:21,299
Now what? Listen to the brain. Hey Sam it's our new pal the disembodied alien brain. The same I am

171
00:30:21,299 --> 00:30:29,779
speaking to you telepathically. No one else can hear me Sam and Max. The slug brain? I can. Shut

172
00:30:29,779 --> 00:30:36,180
up your earth weapons will never be enough to defeat General Skunkapne. Don't you still have

173
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:46,680
that beacons? Okay to see what Sam is carrying in his inventory click on the cardboard box in the

174
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:52,339
corner. All right so the cardboard box is still here. These are all the items. Find the homing

175
00:30:52,339 --> 00:30:59,750
beacon and left click on it to make Sam pull it out. This is the remote control. This is the homing

176
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:09,559
beacon. Do I have to do it? Just click it okay. Perfect now you must place the homing beacon on

177
00:31:09,559 --> 00:31:21,369
General Skunkapne's back to trap him in the wheel zone. Easy throw it as hard as you can.

178
00:31:22,730 --> 00:31:26,569
Click on a target make Sam use it on that yeah putting on the yeah just throw it as hard as you

179
00:31:26,569 --> 00:31:38,650
can just don't miss. What's that? Did you really believe it would be that easy? Kind of kind of

180
00:31:38,650 --> 00:31:44,170
yeah we're gonna need some kind of cover to get up close and personal with Skunkapne. Max remember

181
00:31:44,170 --> 00:31:50,009
that you have been blessed with the gift you must unlock your abilities with the remaining toys of

182
00:31:50,009 --> 00:32:02,859
power. Behold! Meat? Uh hang on there we go. Is that a nose? That's a that's a nose okay

183
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:11,880
you can make Sam use objects in the world by just nice click it. It's a lump of rhinoplasty the

184
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:16,599
wacky modeling clay that promises hours of fun and delivers about five to ten minutes work.

185
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:28,339
Okay so I got the nose. Max the rhinoplasty will grant you the incredible power of

186
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:34,579
shapeshifting. You can use the rhinoplasty to pick up a picture of any inanimate object

187
00:32:34,579 --> 00:32:38,660
then use the power of your mind to transform into that object. This is a dream sequence or something.

188
00:32:44,089 --> 00:32:48,730
Max now has the power of rhinoplasty remember stop doing that remember that you can left click on

189
00:32:48,730 --> 00:32:54,809
one of the psychic toys to activate it. When the rhinoplasty is selected Max first has to choose

190
00:32:54,809 --> 00:33:00,490
a picture of the thing he wants to turn into. You can make Max look around by clicking and dragging

191
00:33:00,809 --> 00:33:17,619
WASD and then left click on a picture to make Max pick it up. A plant? You can turn into that object

192
00:33:17,619 --> 00:33:27,450
you can click on the lump of rhinoplasty to activate it. Try to look leafy and inconspicuous

193
00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:34,569
Max. I always do. Well done freelance police. Now you must get that homing beacon onto General

194
00:33:34,569 --> 00:33:41,609
Skunkape before he reaches the Bronx or all will be lost. I think I can do it you can make Sam walk

195
00:33:41,609 --> 00:34:05,460
by clicking and dragging or you can do they added WASD finally okay it's just a plant. Oh a plant

196
00:34:06,339 --> 00:34:16,059
I love what you've done with the place my queen. He is talking really well for those teeth where

197
00:34:16,059 --> 00:34:25,500
they are. Now what? Now we just used the remote control Mama Bosco gave us and Skunkape gets

198
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:34,969
sucked right in the penal zone so to speak. All right remote control some of the objects the same

00:34:39,610 --> 00:35:00,010

201
00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:07,449
again soon this gateway will close and there will be nothing to stop me. There should be blood all

202
00:35:07,449 --> 00:35:12,889
over his mouth. I know. You would cut your mouth up every time you were talking. There must be something

203
00:35:13,449 --> 00:35:16,650
I'm talking about like a big like glulate stain of blood all over your whole mouth

204
00:35:17,530 --> 00:35:23,929
I can't open the doors now but I have an idea before he was in prison your friend the mole

Can I do WASD? Oh you can. Is there a run? Is there a double tap to run? Space? Shift?

207
00:35:46,090 --> 00:35:49,849

210
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:16,360

217
00:37:25,239 --> 00:37:30,780
I just pretended to know what I was doing and would read chat and some one person would say

218
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:36,230
the solution and then I would walk around for like a couple minutes pretending I was solving the

219
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:42,389
puzzle when in reality I knew the answer like 10 minutes before and was just piecing it all together

220
00:37:43,110 --> 00:37:58,059
to make it look like I knew what was going on that I'm kidding people you guys are taking this too

consciousness into the fleshy minds of others and pluck out their most intimate thoughts

anywhere near nutrient rich once i've perfected this recipe i'll never need to worry about money

363
01:00:05,429 --> 01:00:11,110
again we're gonna make another person out of this broth isn't it kind of overkill to have a radio

364
01:00:11,190 --> 01:00:19,110
and a jukebox anything to drown out the noise my granddaughter calls music it ruins the digestion

365
01:00:19,750 --> 01:00:26,820
to be fair sam stinky's food does require you to be 100 focused on digestion okay you got more

366
01:00:26,820 --> 01:00:32,659
station are you listening to there'd be only one station worth listening to in the greater new york

385
01:02:37,980 --> 01:02:42,699
wow i never would have guessed grandpa stinky was so prejudiced against non-player characters

386

scattered throughout the galaxy by the great comet it's believed to give the holder the power to see

422
01:08:04,460 --> 01:08:08,780
the future what a coincidence i was just he was just saying how he wished he could see the future

423
01:08:08,780 --> 01:08:13,659

bosco invented or an award mama bosco got for inventing something either way it's pretty

591
01:33:10,460 --> 01:33:22,220

592
01:33:22,220 --> 01:33:34,520
max and me to exist oh no wait uh i was reading it wrong okay let's uh let's take out the future

01:43:32,090 --> 01:43:38,010
inconvenient store not everything happens on your street sam besides that place isn't zoned for

674
01:43:38,010 --> 01:43:43,449
mixed use haunting they've got guys from the city coming by every day to evict me from this place

675
01:43:43,449 --> 01:43:50,359
only way to get rid of them is by making the walls bleed how's the afterlife treating you mrs mama

676
01:43:50,359 --> 01:43:57,880
bosco that's doctor mama bosco i spent the summer getting my phd online yeah i started to do that

677
01:43:57,880 --> 01:44:03,239
but i kept getting distracted by all the funny cat pictures you don't know how to use computers max

678
01:44:03,239 --> 01:44:08,199
what's your doctorate in mama bosco bridging the trans-dimensional gap to return spirits to

679
01:44:08,199 --> 01:44:16,100
their corporeal form my masters was in funny cat pictures sounds like you're tired of being a ghost

680
01:44:16,100 --> 01:44:20,819
oh it's not all bad i'm getting better at apparating and now i don't leave a trail of

681
01:44:20,819 --> 01:44:26,500
ectoplasmic slime behind every time i leave the room that's better than sam can say but i'll be

682
01:44:26,500 --> 01:44:31,220
glad when i finish my dimensional destabilizer and get my body back are you guys minus doing

683
01:44:31,220 --> 01:44:34,739
things that i'm not saying yeah touching is my third favorite thing to do to things

684
01:44:35,460 --> 01:44:41,819
uh in case anyone was curious second is licking all right

685
01:44:48,199 --> 01:44:54,680
can we have a separate meter for the other guys here you're a doctor can you tell us anything

686
01:44:54,680 --> 01:45:01,800
about late onset male psychic dysfunction psychic powers it's probably a melon-sized deadly tumor

687
01:45:01,800 --> 01:45:07,560
probably well it could be mind worms of course but i don't want to be alarmist most likely it's

688
01:45:07,560 --> 01:45:14,069
the deadly tumor couldn't max just have the perfectly safe kind of non-lethal psychic

689
01:45:14,069 --> 01:45:20,550
powers oh it's max uh i'm sure it's nothing to worry about then could you uh i'm treating it

690
01:45:20,550 --> 01:45:28,819
like reddit gold farther away from my machines though oh thanks for the gold are these psychic

691
01:45:28,819 --> 01:45:35,619
powers dangerous for max at all well probably not if he's careful and only uses them responsibly

692
01:45:35,619 --> 01:45:40,180
everything on this stream is my responsibility he'll overwork his brain so much that it catches

693
01:45:40,180 --> 01:45:45,939
fire and explodes oh i have got to see that you can't see that max your brain will catch

694
01:45:45,939 --> 01:45:53,460
fire and explode that's why you'll have to record it for me sam duh it is your stream after all on

695
01:45:53,460 --> 01:46:03,689
the other side dr mama bosco not if i can get this destabilizer working all right so we were good

696
01:46:05,020 --> 01:46:11,609
okay just mute the game every time they say a bad joke well the subtitles on you'll read it

697
01:46:15,300 --> 01:46:21,060
every time they say something not funny i have to say something really funny and every time they

698
01:46:21,060 --> 01:46:26,010
say something really funny i have to say something terrible so the score will even out completely

699
01:46:26,649 --> 01:46:41,340
i'll work on it anything else in here are you guys ready to help us fight crime we're still on

700
01:46:41,340 --> 01:46:48,699
a search for new recruits if you spot any new office equipment be sure to hook a brother up

701
01:46:49,739 --> 01:46:53,739
oh wait wait wait what about the give me the jumping jumper cables neither of us knows how

702
01:46:53,739 --> 01:46:59,899
to use them it's simple sam the red cable goes on the right nipple and the black cable clamps to

703
01:46:59,899 --> 01:47:15,750

1078
02:54:54,700 --> 02:55:00,299
futuristic power core don't forget the jumper cable sam they were very important whatever the

1079
02:55:00,299 --> 02:55:10,059
case listen carefully do not trust general scone cafe he is he is oh something's happening toys

1084
02:56:01,510 --> 02:56:08,819
like that the toys of this planet must have astonishing power where is skunk ape's collection

1085
02:56:08,819 --> 02:56:14,579
of magic toys he keeps them on display as a show of power i'm regaining control over the

1086
02:56:14,579 --> 02:56:21,620
ship's functions so i can reveal them to you behold no we just we are with us that's it

1087
02:56:21,620 --> 02:56:26,979
it's a toy that lets you teleport across vast distances in the blink of an eye harry's on

1088
02:56:26,979 --> 02:56:33,780
vacation he's over there that's not cool enough for you it's just we saw more toys in max's vision

1089
02:56:34,579 --> 02:56:40,739
more toys you must not have found them yet they must still be somewhere in this city you have to

1090
02:56:40,739 --> 02:56:49,860
find them before scone cafe does or he'll destroy us all all right i need the other toys i got this

1091
02:56:49,860 --> 02:56:56,969
the rocket launcher i need the i gotta get the telephone go give me the give me the phone

1092
02:56:58,940 --> 02:57:03,590
wait is that it can i talk to you anymore do you have any more dialogue

1093
02:57:03,590 --> 02:57:11,030
sam and max do not trust scone cafe his benevolent facade belies a heart of pure evil

1094
02:57:11,670 --> 02:57:16,629
oh yeah we kind of already figured that out the giant fang spaceship with disintegrator eyes

1095
02:57:16,629 --> 02:57:25,139
was our first clue are you calling me gullible what look i don't know what planet you're from

1096
02:57:25,139 --> 02:57:30,420
this one actually but on my world if an alien invites you onto a spaceship you don't just

1097
02:57:30,420 --> 02:57:35,780
assume that he's going to cut out your brain and keep it in a jar i guess we're just not

1098
02:57:35,780 --> 02:57:42,340
that cynical to be fair max your future vision goggles did tip us off you mean you wield the

1099
02:57:42,340 --> 02:57:51,670
eyes of yogg-zagoth but but that must mean you also have the gift is is max is gonna end up being

1100
02:57:52,549 --> 02:58:01,139
yogg-zagoth right something like that i could see that happening in the future you seem to

1101
02:58:01,139 --> 02:58:07,780
know all about max's psychic powers yes max is one with the gift the toys have great power but

1102
02:58:07,780 --> 02:58:13,780
only to those of us with a special brain well max does have a special brain that's what all the

1103
02:58:13,780 --> 02:58:20,739
teachers said well that and back back i cast the out demon you must use the gift wisely max and

1104
02:58:20,739 --> 02:58:27,700
keep it secret from general scone cafe the power is every bit as dangerous as it is wicked awesome

1105
02:58:29,559 --> 02:58:36,440
okay so where the what's that more processing room all about isn't it obvious general scone cafe

1106
02:58:36,440 --> 02:58:44,360
is illegally harvesting mold juice old juice it's the it's blood they they they're mammals there's

1107
02:58:44,360 --> 02:58:54,729
blood this is just okay what is skunk ape's evil scheme anyhow no less than domination of the entire

1108
02:58:54,729 --> 02:59:01,690
universe did he ever mention anything more specific he's traveling from planet to planet

1109
02:59:01,690 --> 02:59:07,530
searching for all the toys of power if he ever manages to collect all of them he'll be completely

1110
02:59:07,530 --> 02:59:16,100
unstoppable mammals not the only thing with blood yeah but i mean like a mole is a mammal they just

1111
02:59:16,100 --> 02:59:25,159
have red blood they have like human blood moles cows dogs humans they all have blood they all

1112
02:59:25,159 --> 02:59:32,739
have human blood we all have the same blood why did skunk ape come here to our street he's been

1113
02:59:32,739 --> 02:59:39,139
using my strange psychic connection to the toys of power to track them throughout the galaxy

1114
02:59:39,139 --> 02:59:45,700
something very powerful pulled me to this spot i can only guess it was max's discovery of the

1115
02:59:45,700 --> 02:59:55,219
eyes of yog sagoth and the future vision what's your story brain can we get you anything like a

1116
02:59:55,219 --> 03:00:01,780
spine no it's too late for me i'm afraid i can only help you put a stop to general scone cafe's

1117
03:00:01,780 --> 03:00:07,700
evil schemes by controlling the doors and the higher functions of this spaceship we must work

1118
03:00:07,700 --> 03:00:15,459
quickly before what is in this broth is that oregano it's delightful stay focused pal it's

1119
03:00:15,459 --> 03:00:22,340
demon broth okay i think i got it how did you get here i have found a mysterious toy and was using

1120
03:00:22,340 --> 03:00:29,459
my strange power over it to amaze and delight the ladies of my village it was then that scone cafe's

1121
03:00:29,459 --> 03:00:35,620
ship landed he was intrigued with my power and invited me on board his spaceship so you just

1122
03:00:35,620 --> 03:00:42,260
went with him he said he had candy how is i supposed to know he'd imprisoned me here forcing me to use

1123
03:00:42,260 --> 03:00:49,829
my psychic powers against my will okay where's your body what did you look like back when you

1124
03:00:49,829 --> 03:00:56,870
had a body oh nothing exceptional about 63 raven hair i had what you earthlings call a runner's

1125
03:00:56,870 --> 03:01:03,270
build i can read minds in the future you know all right fine i believe the closest creature you have

1126
03:01:03,270 --> 03:01:11,639
on your planet is called a platypus okay why are we supposed to stop scone cape any weaknesses like

1127
03:01:11,639 --> 03:01:17,000
he's powerless against the color yellow or he can't cross running water or he's powerless against

1128
03:01:17,000 --> 03:01:23,399
yellow water i know what you're thinking max and stop it well of course the toys of power are useless

1129
03:01:23,399 --> 03:01:28,520
to him without a gifted brain to control them so he doesn't have a different brand he always says

1130
03:01:28,520 --> 03:01:33,879
he has a weakness for potato chips and he has to eat the whole bag yeah that doesn't really help us

1131
03:01:33,879 --> 03:01:42,569
much sometimes when he's in the shower i could swear i hear him crying why do you think max's

1132
03:01:42,569 --> 03:01:47,930
powers are dangerous apart from the obvious of course general scone cafe can't use the

1133
03:01:47,930 --> 03:01:54,729
toys of power himself so he needs the brain of someone who has the gift he forced me to use my

1134
03:01:54,729 --> 03:02:01,690
power so much that i would have died had you not rescued me if he ever found out you have the gift

1135
03:02:01,690 --> 03:02:10,629
max he wouldn't hesitate to do the same to you okay that's all the evidence we need let's go out

1136
03:02:10,629 --> 03:02:16,389
and deliver some interplanetary justice max if you end up cutting out his brain i call dibs on

1137
03:02:16,389 --> 03:02:23,139
scone cafe's body yeah this is like this is the bad guy probably okay so now we gotta go

1138
03:02:25,159 --> 03:02:32,649
and we have a scanner and i somehow just clicked out of the window i don't know how that happened

1139
03:02:32,649 --> 03:02:48,940
play just dance spaceship is secure if i could have a moment sirs hello sam mr president if you

1140
03:02:48,940 --> 03:02:54,459
have a moment you need to be debriefed too late this may come as a shock but our intel indicates

1141
03:02:54,459 --> 03:03:04,680
that general scone cafe is actually quite evil no i'm pretty sure i never heard of a department

1142
03:03:04,680 --> 03:03:10,440
of home world security agent super ball established in 1901 by theodore roosevelt after president

1143
03:03:10,440 --> 03:03:15,239
mckinley's assassination by one of the insect doors of the nebulon empire i'm president of

1144
03:03:15,239 --> 03:03:20,520
the united states why didn't i hear anything about it it's explained in books sir all right

1145
03:03:20,520 --> 03:03:27,290
the other fucking 30 viruses i have they'll all eat each other until there's one that remains and

1146
03:03:27,290 --> 03:03:32,170
then i'll just remove that with a fucking fucking c cleaner is that why you were hanging out in

1147
03:03:32,170 --> 03:03:39,290
our office so much last season i mean a few months ago to protect max um sure wow i feel

1148
03:03:39,290 --> 03:03:55,540
really close to you right now agent super ball likewise sir a bit too close okay what's the real

1149
03:03:55,540 --> 03:04:00,739
story behind skunk ape general skunk cafe is an intergalactic criminal warlord there's been a

1150
03:04:00,739 --> 03:04:05,540
galaxy-wide gorilla haunted effect ever since he escaped from the penal zone oh i didn't talk

1151
03:04:05,540 --> 03:04:08,739
about the thing that i want to do it's an interdimensional prison for the most dangerous

1152
03:04:08,739 --> 03:04:13,459
villains in the universe are we supposed to get skunk ape back into the penal zone the united

1153
03:04:13,459 --> 03:04:17,620
planets have simple and easily reproducible failsafe measures in place to handle escape

1154
03:04:17,620 --> 03:04:22,979
convicts well that's a relief all we need to do is open an unstable transdimensional gateway to

1155
03:04:22,979 --> 03:04:28,020
the penal zone and his prisoner's badge will take care of the rest didn't they do this schtick before

1156
03:04:28,100 --> 03:04:34,260
a couple times where you you you do the end of the game and then they do go back and do everything

1157
03:04:34,260 --> 03:04:39,780
before the end of the game like they hey this is that very end and but now do the whole thing

1158
03:04:39,780 --> 03:04:44,739
they've done it like two or three times uh but anyways i was in the recommended channel a few

1159
03:04:44,739 --> 03:04:52,260
days ago and i saw an idea that looked really really funny i believe it was vr josh that had

1160
03:04:52,260 --> 03:04:59,379
this idea so you know whoever else contributed to it like props props to you um do you remember

1161
03:04:59,379 --> 03:05:06,120
when last week i showed that video and in the video the person it was somebody's music video

1162
03:05:06,120 --> 03:05:13,750
and they had hidden me in like a part of the tree if you weren't there but if you were there you'll

1163
03:05:13,750 --> 03:05:20,149
know so they hid me in a part like in one frame of a video and they were saying oh look you're

1164
03:05:20,149 --> 03:05:28,020
in this video and we couldn't find it so what the recommendation said wouldn't it be fun potentially

1165
03:05:28,739 --> 03:05:36,200
if i did a whole stream where it was just where's waldo people would submit images that i would get

1166
03:05:36,200 --> 03:05:45,219
to have a magnifying glass and try to find where they'd put me in the image i feel like it would

1167
03:05:45,219 --> 03:05:53,559
be pretty fun i get to have the only criteria is obviously there has to be it's going to be

1168
03:05:53,559 --> 03:06:01,100
completely vetted um so i get to have that little microsoft magnifying glass that's the

1169
03:06:01,100 --> 03:06:05,420
only thing i get and i have to stay a certain amount of uh feet from the screen so i can't

1170
03:06:05,420 --> 03:06:10,299
like lean the fuck in like this no i have to be sitting back here we'll have something to make

1171
03:06:10,299 --> 03:06:15,260
it so like i'll bump into it if i lean forward and i just get the microsoft magnifying glass

1172
03:06:17,530 --> 03:06:20,569
and people can submit it and put me obviously in places wherever they want

1173
03:06:21,530 --> 03:06:30,540
there'll be a lot of hidden memes that's where i have to be careful though because

1174
03:06:31,500 --> 03:06:41,219
they got to be really like cleanly vetted and if you put something fucked up in there

1175
03:06:42,889 --> 03:07:00,360
you're out like yeah like a like a hidden object game when am i going to do it i mean this was

1176
03:07:00,360 --> 03:07:06,250
just a random idea and i thought it was interesting so i would assume if it's something that i'll talk

1177
03:07:06,250 --> 03:07:12,459
to the mods about it and maybe we'll get a plan and then we'll open up obviously potential like

1178
03:07:12,459 --> 03:07:17,020
submissions i didn't notice skunk ape wearing any kind of badge or a homing beacon that's because

1179
03:07:17,020 --> 03:07:22,459
he wasn't wearing one sir i find it extraordinarily alarming whoa whoa whoa whoa calm down you can't

1180
03:07:22,459 --> 03:07:27,100
think with all your hysterics forgive me mr president but unless you can find general skunk

1181
03:07:27,100 --> 03:07:32,920
ape's homing beacon and place it on him we're powerless to stop him there'd have to be rules

1182
03:07:34,379 --> 03:07:38,299
where i would have to be a certain amount of pixels you can't just make me one pixel

1183
03:07:38,299 --> 03:07:46,940
and put me there no no no i have to it has to be solvable i can't be impossible what did this

1184
03:07:46,940 --> 03:07:51,659
homing beacon look like it's a standard issue intergalactic correctional facility in mate's

1185
03:07:51,659 --> 03:07:56,059
badge it can't be destroyed so the only way he could have gotten rid of it is by giving it to

1186
03:07:56,059 --> 03:08:03,739
someone else oh it would be a decent idea is to have a channel for this right at all right i i

1187
03:08:03,739 --> 03:08:11,659
just figured it out so to avoid like hey look i put a like little dick on the screen that you're

1188
03:08:11,659 --> 03:08:15,659
going to scroll over with the magnifying glass and it's going to be hard to like you know go through

1189
03:08:15,659 --> 03:08:20,379
it and screen it all and oh look you scrolled over the dick on on screen oh that's funny

1190
03:08:21,100 --> 03:08:26,379
to make sure that doesn't happen maybe have a chat in the discord open to have like ideas

1191
03:08:26,940 --> 03:08:30,860
and like designated people actually put it in the image you know what i'm saying

1192
03:08:33,850 --> 03:08:45,219
that's probably better a group effort where like only a dozen people have the key i think that's

1193
03:08:45,219 --> 03:08:50,899
pretty good yeah we have to open an unstable trans-dimensional gateway you must have lost

1194
03:08:50,899 --> 03:08:55,379
your senses man the odds against that are astronomical even if we didn't know what that

1195
03:08:55,379 --> 03:09:01,059
was the gateway is the easy part sirs dr mama boscow's reckless and blasphemous work tearing

1196
03:09:01,059 --> 03:09:08,120
down the fabric of reality could be useful that'd be fun give me the key give me the key

1197
03:09:12,360 --> 03:09:17,879
a school group project where one guy does all the work her dimensional destabilizer can open

1198
03:09:17,879 --> 03:09:22,280
a gateway to the penal zone anyone wearing a prisoner's homing beacon will be returned to

1199
03:09:22,280 --> 03:09:28,139
justice automatically and scientifically okay so we need to hope we need the homing beacon

1200
03:09:29,180 --> 03:09:33,659
we've got to throw it on a scungate back we can't track him without his homing beacon sir

1201
03:09:33,659 --> 03:09:37,739
this will require some traditional detective work all right what's reckless and irrational

1202
03:09:37,739 --> 03:09:42,860
detective work do because that's all we know i'd recommend starting with some of his known contacts

1203
03:09:44,629 --> 03:09:51,110
mama boscow what do we need from mama boscow her dimensional destabilizer can open a gateway to

1204
03:09:51,110 --> 03:09:55,350
the penal zone anyone wearing a prisoner's homing beacon will be returned to justice

1205
03:09:55,350 --> 03:10:03,659
automatically and scientifically all right let's go don't worry super ball we'll hit that gorilla

1206
03:10:03,659 --> 03:10:19,420
where it hurts the most right in the penal zone i get it sir okay wait nothing else with you

1207
03:10:19,979 --> 03:10:24,780
okay well give me the other uh the other item can i get this or do i have to open it or something

1208
03:10:24,780 --> 03:10:33,219
later max this unassuming telephone unlocks the gift of teleportation

1209
03:10:35,139 --> 03:10:42,409
using the power of your mind you can teleport yourself to any phone number you have memorized

1210
03:10:43,290 --> 03:10:48,889
oh boy i want to try it right now all right let's talk what's on of you teleporting off without me

1211
03:10:49,610 --> 03:10:58,920
you can go too sam max will teleport anyone he's touching watch the hands okay

1212
03:10:59,719 --> 03:11:13,379
where do i want to go stinky cell boscow tech civils let's get let's go into stinky cell

1213
03:11:14,180 --> 03:11:32,950
enjoying the ride sam i don't know it's so scary he's made it red

1214
03:11:35,190 --> 03:11:50,219
note to self when traveling through max's brain keep your eyes shut uh-oh my phone just started

1215
03:11:50,219 --> 03:11:58,659
somebody actually just texted me right now that happened that was weird it's stinky cell phone

1216
03:11:58,659 --> 03:12:04,100
but why would she have left it behind especially since she's got 18 months left on her contract

1217
03:12:04,100 --> 03:12:08,500
either there was some kind of struggle or it was left here for us to find and we're walking right

1218
03:12:08,500 --> 03:12:13,860
into a trap i got it she waived her early cancellation fees with a recommended device

1219
03:12:13,860 --> 03:12:18,819
upgrade just happened so now we know two things you're an idiot and this phone is going to lead

1220
03:12:18,819 --> 03:12:32,760
us directly to general skunking somehow what the fuck i can't win well now i have the phone

1221
03:12:33,719 --> 03:12:40,780
i got the phone the scanner the warrant what else do i need to find carmen san diego

1222
03:12:41,659 --> 03:13:14,139
let's teleport somewhere was that a cow civil where's her phone shouldn't i have been appeared

1223
03:13:14,139 --> 03:13:22,100
in the box all right we gotta go we gotta i got a scanner what's this it's one of those obsolete

1224
03:13:22,100 --> 03:13:29,829
all-in-one scanner fax copier juice maker machines can't interact with the rats have already tried

1225
03:13:32,149 --> 03:13:36,790
nothing in the boxes a good thing civil packed all our junk into these boxes for safe keeping

1226
03:13:36,790 --> 03:13:41,190
and i'm especially glad we didn't put it in a secure environmentally regulated storage facility

1227
03:13:41,190 --> 03:13:45,590
like she asked us to yeah this way's a lot cheaper and everybody gets to enjoy it

1228
03:13:46,709 --> 03:14:05,940
and then back there phones light up again uh hold on what about the phone in here are you guys still

1229
03:14:05,940 --> 03:14:11,219
looking for a fourth member well hello there beautiful were your moving parts properly

1230
03:14:11,219 --> 03:14:19,459
secured when you fell from heaven do not forget our seminar on workplace harassment

1231
03:14:19,459 --> 03:14:25,219
plus i called dibs when exactly did this get really creepy thank you for joining us in a

1232
03:14:25,219 --> 03:14:30,100
brand new style of 20th century crime play you can begin submitting clues to the crime

1233
03:14:30,100 --> 03:14:35,700
drawn whenever you find them i do have ideas on the case cops we're sorry we haven't been

1234
03:14:35,700 --> 03:14:41,860
paying attention i got a phone and evidence with the crime hyphen tron and we will track

1235
03:14:41,860 --> 03:14:50,540
down the villains without mercy am i angry angry what no it's because i'm in like a blue room

1236
03:14:50,540 --> 03:14:55,959
and i probably look menacing i don't want to toss this thing around i might break it

1237
03:14:59,079 --> 03:15:04,760
i'm inside of like the hold on i better keep this note there could be valuable information on it

1238
03:15:04,760 --> 03:15:12,950
that's not evidence wait the phone and this this is not evidence i better keep this note

1239
03:15:12,950 --> 03:15:17,690
there could be valuable information on it it looks like you're using the crime tron

1240
03:15:18,250 --> 03:15:24,600
would you like help uh sure i keep it short place any two pieces of evidence

1241
03:15:24,600 --> 03:15:30,360
two pieces of evidence excel multi-scanner if a piece of evidence is found on our database

1242
03:15:30,360 --> 03:15:38,760
you'll hear this noise if we cannot recognize a piece you'll hear this after two items are inserted

1243
03:15:38,760 --> 03:15:45,319
our exclusive clue match technology will scan for possible connections advanced data analysis

1244
03:15:45,319 --> 03:15:52,920
algorithms will compare the evidence against our 64kb database set up to one two calculations per

1245
03:15:52,920 --> 03:15:59,719
second you're not helping it's really not all that complicated i can also help organize your

1246
03:15:59,719 --> 03:16:05,159
compact disk collection if the crime tron can find the connection between the two pieces of

1247
03:16:05,159 --> 03:16:16,600
evidence then you get yourself a new location on your map yeah let's go item not found in database

1248
03:16:19,399 --> 03:16:25,909
really if stinky went somewhere to meet skunk eight she's probably got the number of a place on speed

1249
03:16:25,909 --> 03:16:38,860
dial that don't work so if stinky went somewhere to meet skunk okay she's probably got the number

1250
03:16:38,860 --> 03:16:53,379
of a place on speed dial so this is not it item not recognized come on i need another piece of

1251
03:16:53,379 --> 03:17:01,270
evidence i need the phone but the phone number is on there do we need two phones all right those

1252
03:17:01,270 --> 03:17:07,610
don't work so i need something else what do you mean wait wait what are you talking about this is

1253
03:17:07,610 --> 03:17:20,229
my gun if stinky went somewhere to meet skunking she's probably got the number of my gun so that's

1254
03:17:20,229 --> 03:17:25,270
not it general skunk it could be anywhere in the city he could have at least left the forwarding

1255
03:17:25,270 --> 03:17:34,010
address or phone number i don't i really it's the note flint paper found from the mysterious

1256
03:17:34,010 --> 03:17:42,889
mister s to stinky that number and then the phone i don't want to use up stinky's minutes

1257
03:17:42,889 --> 03:17:48,170

1354
03:36:23,690 --> 03:36:34,709
talk to mama vasco i yeah mama vasco what's going on here mama vasco help

1355
03:36:34,709 --> 03:36:41,319
thanks for getting rid of those gorillas sam and max all right what does that dimensional

1356
03:36:41,319 --> 03:36:47,239
destabilizer do exactly it opens a temporary gateway between one dimension and the next

1357
03:36:47,239 --> 03:36:52,280
which can pull someone from the spirit world into the real world or from the real world to

1358
03:36:52,280 --> 03:36:58,040
an interdimensional prison i suppose so we need that do you think that's what skunk ape was trying

1359
03:36:58,040 --> 03:37:02,680
to keep people from finding i don't know my money's still on the big screen thing that's

1360
03:37:02,680 --> 03:37:08,120
just cool well it's worth a try i built a remote control so you can open the gateway

1361
03:37:08,120 --> 03:37:13,319
anywhere it'll only stay open a few minutes so you've got to make sure you do it right

1362
03:37:13,319 --> 03:37:17,719
anybody holding something tuned to the alternate dimension will get sucked right in

1363
03:37:19,159 --> 03:37:26,409
okay max is confused about how that dimensional destabilizer works you just have to find skunk

1364
03:37:26,969 --> 03:37:31,370
and open up the gateway if he's holding anything tuned to that dimension he'll get sucked in

1365
03:37:31,370 --> 03:37:36,969
sucked right in the remote control for it is right over there get the remote he needs to have

1366
03:37:36,969 --> 03:37:42,569
something that is tuned to the second dimension they came in and took over the place right after

1367
03:37:42,569 --> 03:37:49,370
i told him about my dimensional destabilizer well that was uncalled for yeah i mean sure she's

1368
03:37:49,370 --> 03:37:54,809
really boring about it but that's no excuse for violence i'm pretty sure he was trying to keep

1369
03:37:54,809 --> 03:38:09,930
anybody from using my inventions against him don't make me do it did skunk ape give you any

1370
03:38:09,930 --> 03:38:15,129
idea what he's got planned nope he just told his guards to make sure nobody found out about my

1371
03:38:15,129 --> 03:38:32,700
inventions let's get on the other side dr mama bosco i'm not gonna do it again don't worry i'm

1372
03:38:32,700 --> 03:38:40,389
just kidding that's what i want you to think okay so let me get the remote thank you i have the

1373
03:38:40,389 --> 03:38:45,989
remote is this the remote control for your destabilizer thing mama bosco that's the one

1374
03:38:46,069 --> 03:38:50,549
make sure you don't press it before you really need to because you only get one chance

1375
03:38:52,170 --> 03:39:11,239
i'll fix the light don't worry too bright um two xbox i feel like i'm at an xbox booth

1402
03:44:14,709 --> 03:44:19,670
ape in our own building well kind of you'd actually be turning your building into an

1403
03:44:19,670 --> 03:44:27,270
alternate dimension so it won't really exist anymore how do we get into our building got to

1407
03:45:05,020 --> 03:45:10,219
attendants do well they're okay i guess just be careful around the back of my neck that's

1408
03:45:10,219 --> 03:45:15,899
where i'm most probably healthy skin that means i'm healthy that means i'm very moist i have lots

1409
03:45:15,899 --> 03:45:39,030
of collagen i've got lots of elasticity i'm very moisturized i think gee little buddy here in 2109

1410
03:45:39,110 --> 03:45:48,920
our street looks pretty much no no no no no max no not the chrysler building that sounds fun i

1411
03:45:48,920 --> 03:46:01,860
can hardly wait what the fuck are you talking about biting my lip again thinking too hard

1412
03:46:02,739 --> 03:46:21,180
all right i'm very obviously missing something important what am i missing where have i not been

1413
03:46:21,180 --> 03:46:30,870
i haven't been down here in a while i haven't been down here in a while yeah let's just see

1414
03:46:30,870 --> 03:46:44,090
see general skunk it could be anywhere in the city he could have at least left a forwarding

1415
03:46:44,090 --> 03:46:54,729
address or a phone number you could be anywhere in the city rosemary keeps wandering off and

1416
03:46:54,729 --> 03:47:03,350
leaving this thing behind we've already seen this anything at all any wait wait wait wait wait wait

1417
03:47:03,350 --> 03:47:11,399
wait there's nobody there anymore as much as i'd love to get over there i'm not quite willing to

1418
03:47:11,399 --> 03:47:19,059
swim through the muck come on can i go in the hole and then walk down this way no i can't cross

1419
03:47:19,059 --> 03:47:25,139
the the game uh cartridges i don't think that can come down here but i can't go this way

1422
03:47:52,870 --> 03:47:57,190
we get over there how do i get in there too knowing us it's probably something clever but

1423
03:47:57,190 --> 03:48:08,010
overly complicated probably you're not gonna know how we get over there

1424
03:48:08,010 --> 03:48:17,350
me too that's all i'm gonna get that we eventually just come out wouldn't you like to know

1425
03:48:17,350 --> 03:48:33,020

1426
03:48:34,459 --> 03:48:38,700

1435
03:49:54,680 --> 03:50:00,440

1499
03:59:30,950 --> 03:59:35,190
in a dialogue sequence i don't know that i thought backing out would just pull them out too

1500
03:59:43,030 --> 03:59:47,110

04:28:03,370 --> 04:28:08,569
did you lose yourself

1673
04:28:10,569 --> 04:28:19,850
hang on a second i am your love monkey yes highest can copy i see you that's very clever

1674
04:28:20,889 --> 04:28:25,770
he's been texting me non-stop i tried to throw the phone away just to get away from it

1675
04:28:27,129 --> 04:28:33,850
can you call for help on your fancy futuristic phone i already tried that when you guys were

1676
04:28:33,850 --> 04:28:38,889
knocked out there's no signal off this spaceship no signal but throw that phone

1677
04:28:39,930 --> 04:28:44,409
throw that phone out there so we can teleport out of the cell yeah isn't skunk ape your boyfriend

1678
04:28:44,409 --> 04:28:51,850
you he wishes he is so not my type you only have to date an evil gorilla once to learn never to make

1679
04:28:51,850 --> 04:29:01,639
that mistake again just slide it up there and we'll teleport out what are we doing here how is this

1680
04:29:01,639 --> 04:29:07,239
grandpa stinky's fault he's been going on and on about skunk copy ever since he landed

1681
04:29:07,239 --> 04:29:10,520
that's the kind of gentleman you should get involved with he's got a future

1682
04:29:12,200 --> 04:29:18,200
how about skunk ape's the jerk stay away from skunk ape the guy's a total butthorn

1683
04:29:18,200 --> 04:29:22,520
you're telling me i was just going to meet my to meet a friend at the top of the empire state

1684
04:29:22,520 --> 04:29:27,159
building then all of a sudden this giant gorilla shows up and carries me off to be his queen or

1685
04:29:27,159 --> 04:29:31,879
something gee you think a hyper intelligent alien could have come up with something more original

1686
04:29:31,959 --> 04:29:35,639
i'm not buying this super advanced technology business if they haven't even mastered the

1687
04:29:35,639 --> 04:29:40,360
technique of margaritas and unexpected car trouble you know i don't think i've ever had

1688
04:29:40,360 --> 04:29:45,159
a margarita before in my whole life i think you're being too hard on skunk ape he's just

1689
04:29:45,159 --> 04:29:52,760
misunderstood oh yeah uh did i misunderstand this picture he sent me good heavens i think i should

1690
04:29:52,760 --> 04:30:00,299
put on some clothes now well skunk ape's got a lot of good points too name one he's got a couple of

1691
04:30:00,299 --> 04:30:06,219
good qualities he's got he's got his own spaceship i noticed that may impress you boys but the keys

1692
04:30:06,219 --> 04:30:10,940
to your cage so he could let you out but then she wouldn't be able to talk to us anymore

1693
04:30:14,870 --> 04:30:27,719
you general skunk ape we're all set max now we just got to get out of this cage so we can wrap this

1694
04:30:27,719 --> 04:30:55,540
case up reading take that die earthlings die game let's go plan well done freelance police now you

1695
04:30:55,540 --> 04:31:03,540
must place the homing beacon on skunk ape's back to trap him in the peel zone we're on it now light

1696
04:31:03,540 --> 04:31:12,920
up those toys the hell looking for these oh he looked through his 3d glasses and saw the

1697
04:31:12,920 --> 04:31:23,180
future has proven to be most enlightening here use it to witness how i'm going to destroy you

1698
04:31:24,620 --> 04:31:32,540
so what was that plan b again i believe you planned to turn on the dimensional destabilizer yes

1699
04:31:33,500 --> 04:31:39,579
luckily i have my own but i've still got the homing beacon exactly

1700
04:31:50,790 --> 04:31:56,709
can you believe that guy skunk ape knew what we were going to do the whole time he just wanted

1701
04:31:56,709 --> 04:32:02,870
to rub our noses in the penal zone from software end game level what do we do you're not supposed

1702
04:32:02,950 --> 04:32:08,389
to max it's a horrible plane of non-existence forever trapped between reality and unreality

1703
04:32:08,389 --> 04:32:16,170
yeah that and also that beeping noise is really getting on my nerves turn around max skunk ape

1704
04:32:16,170 --> 04:32:26,600
strapped an antimatter bomb on your back while we were out cold get rid of it what does it say

1705
04:32:27,559 --> 04:32:31,079
jeez what a jerk we've got to get out of here max pronto

1706
04:32:33,590 --> 04:32:42,020
we if i know my high tech futuristic explosive devices this is an anti-matter bomb that will

1707
04:32:42,020 --> 04:32:47,379
destroy the entire penal zone and anyone inside it and it's going to go off at any second really

1708
04:32:47,379 --> 04:32:58,459
sam any second well maybe i'm exaggerating hours but still best not to dawdle how did you land how

1709
04:32:58,459 --> 04:33:03,350
are you up there all right what do i do i have whatever items i got the paddle i've got the

1710
04:33:03,350 --> 04:33:09,290
homing beacon i got the shock glass you know unless you might as well what else is even over

1711
04:33:09,290 --> 04:33:23,990
here anything let's put the homing beacon onto the the explosive no let's not put the homing

1712
04:33:23,990 --> 04:33:28,389
beacon on the explosive all right that's not the right thing to do shock last i'd better keep this

1713
04:33:28,389 --> 04:33:35,700
it could be an important clue in our case how about um can i tell can i do i still have a

1714
04:33:35,700 --> 04:33:41,139
teleporter oh shit he didn't take wait wait hold on wait what about the future button

1715
04:33:44,459 --> 04:34:26,680
i thought he wouldn't wait i guess he didn't take it i just come back gotcha

1716
04:34:28,659 --> 04:34:35,220
welcome back sirs uh what just happened i detected a spike in antimatter radiation

1717
04:34:35,220 --> 04:34:39,860
so i locked onto the signal from your homing beacon and reversed the polarity of the dimensional

1718
04:34:39,860 --> 04:34:44,259
stabilization field to intercept yeah yeah just tell us how we can get back at skunk ape for crimes

1719
04:34:44,259 --> 04:34:49,619
against the freelance police and humanity i say let's cover him in candy bar wrappers and feed

1720
04:34:49,619 --> 04:34:56,259
him to starving raccoons you failed to trap him in the penal zone i wouldn't say failed exactly uh

1721
04:34:56,259 --> 04:35:03,700
maybe underperformed and we blew up the penal zone with an anti-matter bomb oh dear how can i help

1722
04:35:03,700 --> 04:35:08,099
sam and max doctor mama bosko has been granted the fullest security clearance possible for a

1723
04:35:08,099 --> 04:35:15,400
dead citizen mr president okay can't we just use that destabilizer thing to open up another

1724
04:35:15,400 --> 04:35:22,869
gateway not now that the penal zone has been destroyed how are we going to stop skunk now

1725
04:35:22,869 --> 04:35:28,790
with the penal zone destroyed we have no way to return him to prison unless you could make

1726
04:35:28,790 --> 04:35:35,430
another penal zone somewhere else i smell a convoluted plan coming on with a side order

1727
04:35:35,430 --> 04:35:41,430
of hand-waving technical nonsense extra crispy before i made the destabilizer i was working on

1728
04:35:41,430 --> 04:35:45,909
a dimensional rift generator it doesn't open a gateway to another dimension it actually

1729
04:35:45,909 --> 04:35:51,349
creates another dimension only problem is you'll have to find a nexus of ley lines somewhere for

1730
04:35:51,349 --> 04:35:56,069
it to work a place where the border between reality and nonsense has broken down there is

1731
04:35:56,069 --> 04:36:00,950
there happens to be one of those in the city man it's a 1313 straight street i was gonna say

1732
04:36:00,950 --> 04:36:09,990
address sounds familiar that's our building what if i put my minecraft bed okay how does this

1733
04:36:09,990 --> 04:36:15,270
rift generator work you just plug it in and press the pedal after that it works just like the

1734
04:36:15,270 --> 04:36:21,349
destabilizer if skunkope is wearing that homing beacon he'll get pulled into the new dimension

1735
04:36:21,349 --> 04:36:27,590
the trick is finding enough power do you have any more of those power cores lying around no i

1736
04:36:27,590 --> 04:36:32,229
never did get that back but even so it would have taken a hundred of those things to give enough

1737
04:36:32,229 --> 04:36:36,869
power to a dimensional rift generator it's over there with the other inventions that are a deadly

1738
04:36:36,869 --> 04:36:44,840
radiation hazard so you're suggesting we trap skunk ape in our own building well kind of you'd

1739
04:36:44,840 --> 04:36:50,360
actually be turning your building into an alternate dimension so it won't really exist anymore i'm

1740
04:36:50,360 --> 04:36:55,639
afraid it's the only way sirs and the plus side if it doesn't exist think of how much money we'll

1741
04:36:55,639 --> 04:37:02,740
save on rent we don't pay rent max can't we just use that destabilizer thing to open up another

1742
04:37:02,740 --> 04:37:07,619
gateway not now that the penal zone has been destroyed you'll have to use mama bosko's rift

1743
04:37:07,619 --> 04:37:14,950
generator to create a new penal zone see on the other side dr mama bosko we're doing a whole lot

1744
04:37:14,950 --> 04:37:20,549
of this today like put your fucking hands you know what's because there's a lot of breaks in

1745
04:37:20,549 --> 04:37:24,869
between using your hands in the game so i just i like moving around like a fucking magician

1746
04:37:25,669 --> 04:37:32,540
because i only need one hand to play this right we'll be careful with your rift generator mama

1747
04:37:32,540 --> 04:37:36,939
bosko just make sure you don't turn it on until you've got that homing beacon on general skunk

1748
04:37:36,939 --> 04:38:02,009
ape the fuck happened here it's like this is like i don't want no i don't want i don't want to

1749
04:38:03,369 --> 04:38:09,099
i don't want you to see what's under here guys my mother's that person that puts our name and

1750
04:38:09,099 --> 04:38:15,740
address as a fucking tag on everything that we own i can't help it on all of my nintendo games

1751
04:38:15,740 --> 04:38:33,529
on all of my fucking uh electronics i i don't just look what happened it's mama bosko's

1752
04:38:33,529 --> 04:38:42,580
dimensional destabilizer thing all right so i gotta do i got this thing gotta plug it in

1753
04:38:42,580 --> 04:38:51,299
turn it on bye guys i'll see you when i fix the fucking universe

1754
04:38:52,180 --> 04:39:15,299
we eat the rubber we're sorry we're not driving anywhere with that space gorilla on the loose

1755
04:39:15,299 --> 04:39:20,419
i just want to scan some data just teleport there if you're in such a day hurry to get yourself

1756
04:39:20,419 --> 04:39:28,009
killed all right well so i need to plug this into a power source and we got to go to the

1757
04:39:28,009 --> 04:39:34,250
interdimensional rift that's right outside the just go to sybil's and there's the

1758
04:39:35,209 --> 04:39:47,509
the rift there i just plug it into there what do we do now sam i don't know the powers out in

1759
04:39:47,509 --> 04:39:59,849
the whole building i know where to go do i'm doing

1760
04:39:59,849 --> 04:40:03,610
fighting

1761
04:40:21,000 --> 04:40:29,430
i actually have to dodge this stuff get him to blow so get him to explode something blow this up

1762
04:40:32,759 --> 04:40:38,549
got to get this homing beacon onto general skunky before we get accidentally incarcerated

1763
04:40:38,549 --> 04:41:07,349
out too and take this out too take this out bingo get in gee simple stuff is okay you live on our

1764
04:41:07,349 --> 04:41:11,590
street there's a good chance you're gonna get blown up she should understand that by now sam

1765
04:41:13,209 --> 04:41:19,930
whoa all right now the eyes there's gonna be a power source down here that he's gonna be able

1766
04:41:19,930 --> 04:41:37,159
to shoot through the crack down to the power source plug it in we go over here i can teleport

1767
04:41:37,159 --> 04:41:59,189
to the phone now just in case everybody was curious about what to do next all right then

1768
04:41:59,189 --> 04:42:04,310
ah i was hoping we teleport under an immovable pile of rubble and debris trapped for weeks we'd

1769
04:42:04,310 --> 04:42:09,909
be forced to resort to cannibalism just to survive you keep coming up with creepy disaster scenarios

1770
04:42:09,909 --> 04:42:15,110
that always end up with you eating me max it's getting annoying if you don't like it then stop

1771
04:42:15,110 --> 04:42:19,750
looking so damn tasty can you link me to the watcher you're reading yeah it's uh pc gaming

1772
04:42:19,750 --> 04:42:25,430
strategy it's a good thing civil packed all our junk into these boxes for safe keeping upstairs

1773
04:42:26,389 --> 04:43:04,659
can i go let's go in a mysterious town we're trying to save the planet here damn intruders

1774
04:43:04,659 --> 04:43:12,819
they've come to defile the toy box kill them no it's kind of cool brother look it is the dog and

1775
04:43:12,819 --> 04:43:22,099
rabbit justice prophesied on tablet 8 verse 32 uh excuse me i'm pretty sure you mean tablet 6

1776
04:43:22,099 --> 04:43:29,779
verse 24 heretic looks like another in a long line of wacky cults max we're in so many prophecies

1777
04:43:29,779 --> 04:43:34,740
we should start charging royalties you try and entertain the other wingnuts while i find a way

1778
04:43:34,740 --> 04:43:46,700
to power this thing up so the moles are an ancient group of old beings

1779
04:43:51,750 --> 04:43:59,909
who that's the most evil looking toy chest i've ever seen no doubt it'd unleash all kinds of

1780
04:43:59,909 --> 04:44:06,150
horrors if we ever opened it harry is it'll scrounge up some blasting caps no you mustn't

1781
04:44:06,150 --> 04:44:11,990
open it that would give general skunk up a unimaginable power to destroy us all

1782
04:44:13,029 --> 04:44:21,110
they're right pal we better get rid of skunk ape first all right well plug it in cable the workers

1783
04:44:21,110 --> 04:44:25,349
left some of the cable exposed when they were busy not fixing the power right in here right

1784
04:44:26,919 --> 04:44:46,380
yeah let's go plug the power cable into the boiler there's no place on the toy box to plug this in

1785
04:44:51,349 --> 04:44:59,830
i can't plug a rift generator into that why is it that's just like a jokey outlet over here

1786
04:45:00,470 --> 04:45:09,540
does it go in the outlet well it's plugged in but there's not enough power to turn it on

1787
04:45:10,259 --> 04:45:17,529
okay boiler controls

1788
04:45:21,049 --> 04:45:33,990
well at least the boiler still works uh all right so should i melt them what's with the creepy toy

1789
04:45:33,990 --> 04:45:42,310
box it is everything and nothing the power infinite oh well that makes sense we have guarded

1790
04:45:42,310 --> 04:45:49,189
and worshiped it from behind the shadowy veil of faith for generations we love the box so much

1791
04:45:49,189 --> 04:45:58,869
we've prepared a song about it that song is always the song the toy box cause it's really great

1792
04:45:59,430 --> 04:46:03,669
hey man the musical numbers have really gone downhill since we've been on break

1793
04:46:04,310 --> 04:46:11,830
some of us had grown to believe it was just an allegory i'm looking at you gemadaya but the veil

1794
04:46:11,830 --> 04:46:20,659
has been lifted there it is before us just as the tablets foretold what's inside that toy box

1795
04:46:20,659 --> 04:46:27,220
anyway no one knows no one has seen it for thousands of years there are those who believe

1796
04:46:27,220 --> 04:46:35,060
it contains toys oh right like the creator of all things it's really some fanciful box in the sky

1797
04:46:35,060 --> 04:46:39,700
filled with magical toys you'll have to excuse obadiah he's a fundamentalist

1798
04:46:42,139 --> 04:46:47,259
before it sounded like you were expecting to see max and me yes you're coming with foretold in the

1799
04:46:47,259 --> 04:46:55,020
sacred tablets and scrolls and yay the devil bunny knowing not his true purpose would unlock the

1800
04:46:55,020 --> 04:47:03,419
mysteries of the toy box hey sam it likes me you know what that means obadiah it's time for the

1801
04:47:03,419 --> 04:47:13,319
apocalypse what's that toy box got to do with max he must be blessed with the gift it will bestow

1802
04:47:13,319 --> 04:47:20,520
great power to the one who can use its contents oh and don't forget about the apocalypse you guys

1803
04:47:20,520 --> 04:47:26,840
seem awfully chipper about the end times it's just nice to be proven right for once yeah

1804
04:47:26,840 --> 04:47:31,720
suck on that barry digery who's wearing a stupid looking robe now on that pretzel chat

1805
04:47:32,919 --> 04:47:40,700
it's nice to be proven right who are you guys we are the boxists the last keepers of the true way

1806
04:47:41,500 --> 04:47:47,259
well our brothers have succumbed to the siren song of secular america with its basalt rich

1807
04:47:47,259 --> 04:47:52,779
tunnels and specialty coffees only we remain to act as guardians of the box

1808
04:47:55,020 --> 04:48:00,779
is there anything in your scriptures about how we can defeat skunk ape just that the box will show

1809
04:48:00,779 --> 04:48:09,659
you the way and then the devil bunny and his chubby sidekick hey broke down the wall and slew the

1810
04:48:09,659 --> 04:48:16,869
betrayer of mole men there's a there's a you guys stay crazy there's like an anti-matter

1811
04:48:16,869 --> 04:48:37,720

1867
04:58:16,740 --> 04:58:27,000
he just roars at people no this move was so awesome but you could run out of it so quickly

1868
04:58:27,479 --> 04:58:37,479
when i was like when i was like 13 i remember mashing mashing the special button over and over

1869
04:58:37,479 --> 04:58:43,639
again even with default enemies and i i i spent like 20 dollars in one session i think at one

1870
04:58:43,639 --> 04:58:49,240
point i used all of my allowance money i saved up and i didn't even get to like the third boss

1871
04:58:49,240 --> 04:59:02,810
or something that's i'm that's burned in my brain from childhood just then you'd be completely out

1872
04:59:02,810 --> 04:59:14,779
of mana change your sub sound to that that would be so that'd be so annoying okay so next episode

1873
04:59:14,779 --> 04:59:26,569
we're back and i will take the toy box and the one who can control it yes think of something quick

1874
04:59:26,569 --> 04:59:39,159
sam i don't like the way he's undressing me with his eyes okay um skunk you're under arrest

1875
04:59:39,720 --> 04:59:50,520
ha ha ha under arrest by an earth dog and his pitiful inventions i have more strength in one

1876
04:59:50,520 --> 05:00:05,450
hand than in all the inventions of your planet's greatest scientists as soon as this case is over

1877
05:00:05,450 --> 05:00:14,229
i'm getting a gun with more gorilla stopping power it can't be that easy uh turn up the heat

1878
05:00:14,229 --> 05:00:23,750
turn up the heat it's gonna be too hot in here turn it off we live in cool dark places

1879
05:00:30,229 --> 05:00:40,840
can you take like one step to you to you i better keep this do it again it's hard to believe that

1880
05:00:40,840 --> 05:00:45,479
good old steamy has been sporadically keeping our building warm for almost a century it's even

1881
05:00:45,479 --> 05:00:50,520
harder to build there okay it's good how do i get him to move he's gonna slip on this right

1882
05:00:51,849 --> 05:00:55,689
just stop fighting so we can hurry this thing up already i got places to be

1883
05:00:56,330 --> 05:01:04,009
give up now when i'm so close to having all of the toys just take two steps nonsense

1884
05:01:06,090 --> 05:01:25,240
i'd better keep this pretty sloppy on you to miss this toy skunk ape it's the best one yet

1885
05:01:25,240 --> 05:01:31,880
nonsense it's worthless are you kidding me it's just dripping with psychic power right max

1886
05:01:32,759 --> 05:01:40,409
all right that one gives me the power to uh automatically calculate the proper tip at

1887
05:01:40,409 --> 05:01:47,049
restaurants nice one phone head it's a very practical power sam the kid i'll be showstoppers

1888
05:01:47,049 --> 05:02:00,919
give it to me now keep away from the big monkey no fair give it up save the cards

1889
05:02:00,919 --> 05:02:16,150
yes and so our hero saved the world once again our villain undone by his own greed it would seem

1890
05:02:16,150 --> 05:02:24,310
a fitting conclusion but this is not the end oh no but merely a beginning the overture if you will

1891
05:02:24,310 --> 05:02:33,450
of a five-part symphony of mayhem that will blow your ever-loving mind what is this mysterious toy

1892
05:02:33,930 --> 05:02:41,849
with its bizarre connection to max is general skunk ape truly defeated will sam ever find true

1893
05:02:41,849 --> 05:02:48,810
love will max be able to control his emerging powers but are his ominous visions of the future

1894
05:02:48,810 --> 05:02:56,459
a sign of tragedy to come i'll see you in the coming chapters to answer all of these questions

1895
05:02:56,459 --> 05:03:05,979
and more but for now i leave you with this chilling conclusion couch sucked right through

1896
05:03:05,979 --> 05:03:11,659
three floors in a septic tank there goes our security deposit i wonder if our building is

1897
05:03:11,659 --> 05:03:16,380
zoned to act as an interdimensional prison sam what are they looking at

1898
05:03:17,340 --> 05:03:29,479
holy heaping helpings of herodotus on base with marshal stacks and a wah-wah pedal is that us

1899
05:03:41,029 --> 05:03:46,819
imagine that's the only thing i've said this whole entire time

1900
05:04:09,020 --> 05:04:29,080
down there we go that's nice that's tuned down a little pretty cool what a jump in quality

1901
05:04:30,040 --> 05:04:40,139
yeah i mean the world graphics and uh lengthwise definitely i need to do my fast food tier

1902
05:04:45,590 --> 05:05:01,720
oh right um hold on give me a minute do tier lists that was fun that was um

1903
05:05:02,680 --> 05:05:19,259
a little different than the other ones they tighten the graphics up do a us states tier list

1904
05:05:20,470 --> 05:05:37,849
what like places that i've been season three following a more cohesive story than the last

1905
05:05:37,849 --> 05:05:48,470
two i've never known i've never played it i this is my first time ever playing these games after

1906
05:05:48,470 --> 05:06:07,700
credit scene let's see i waited i waited well there was episode one episode two will be on a

1907
05:06:07,700 --> 05:06:14,840
different day because if the episodes are i mean obviously like 40 minutes of that was

1908
05:06:15,799 --> 05:06:20,119
uh from the bullshit we did with chat and all the weird stuff we were doing earlier

1909
05:06:20,840 --> 05:06:24,439
if they're like three to four hours each or four hours four and a half hours something like that

1910
05:06:25,000 --> 05:06:35,740
then i probably do this on a different day because i know we're gonna be in there for like another

1911
05:06:35,740 --> 05:06:41,419
four to five plus hours he's ended this i'm not end of the stream voicing what are you talking

1912
05:06:41,419 --> 05:06:47,020
about what what why is stopping after episode one mean the stream turns off

1913
05:06:48,869 --> 05:06:56,060
what i'm gonna go pee i'm gonna grab a water i'm gonna come back and hang out and do tier lists

1914
05:06:56,939 --> 05:07:07,400
and something else i'm not leaving what are you talking about i'll be right back that didn't even
