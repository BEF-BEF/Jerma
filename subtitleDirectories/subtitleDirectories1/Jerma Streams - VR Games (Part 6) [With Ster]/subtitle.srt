1
00:00:02,359 --> 00:00:06,360
Sorry guys, we were having a little tech talk.

2
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:11,500
T-E-C-H. Ster's trying to figure out some tech.

3
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:15,500
He's trying to figure out how to get his tech working.

4
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:19,500
Spoiler for everybody here, he didn't get to use his tech.

5
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:26,489
It's still not in a good functioning state, unfortunately.

6
00:00:26,489 --> 00:00:30,489
Wait, wait, wait, it's not over. The stream is not over.

7
00:00:30,489 --> 00:00:36,119
We just started. Hey, there we are.

8
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:41,189
Hi guys. This time I'm back here with Ster.

9
00:00:41,189 --> 00:00:45,619
Who is in fact streaming today.

10
00:00:45,619 --> 00:00:51,189
From what I understand. What I've been told.

11
00:00:51,189 --> 00:00:56,329
We're going to jump right in to pick up what we left off yesterday.

12
00:00:56,329 --> 00:01:00,329
Unless he's got anything to say.

13
00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:04,329
Everything I'm going to say is a technical problem.

14
00:01:04,329 --> 00:01:08,760
So I'm just going to let everyone know.

15
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:13,900
I don't care and I'm ignoring them all.

16
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:18,140
I've had my little headset handbag in my hands here.

17
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:22,140
I've been sitting here waiting for you.

18
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:26,140
I'm ready. How do we join up in game?

19
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:30,140
See you tomorrow. See you in 40 minutes.

20
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:34,140
I have no idea. Let's get in.

21
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:38,140
Are you ready to go in?

22
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:48,700
Shit. Sorry we're a little late.

23
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:54,790
You know what's great about not using a webcam is you just, I'm nude.

24
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:58,790
No one's going to know. Wait, how do you not do a VR stream

25
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:02,790
without a webcam? You've got to have the people watch you do the funny movements.

26
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:06,790
Do you want to wait another 20 minutes? No.

27
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:14,490
No. Alright, I'm going in.

28
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:18,490
This is called Clash of Chefs?

29
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:23,240
I don't know. It's a game where we have to compete and cook food together.

30
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:27,240
Just hold on. Against each other. Not together.

31
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:31,240
Wait, this is not a together game? This is an against game? This is not a together game.

32
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:35,240
Really? I think we're on opposite sides of the room

33
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:39,240
and we're trying to cook the things faster. Your shirt is too small.

34
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:43,990
You want to wait another 20 minutes while I go get another shirt?

35
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:47,990
No. The dryer.

36
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:51,990
That's the advantage right there.

37
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:55,990
Wait, is this the right hand?

38
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:59,990
Guys, something you've got to know about buying shirts. I learned this first hand with this one.

39
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:03,990
First of all, if you buy a medium it's going to turn into a small

40
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:09,900
and don't leave it in the dryer for too long.

41
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:13,900
I like this shirt, okay? It has to be form factor.

42
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:17,900
So my perspiration doesn't get stuck in there.

43
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:22,389
Whatever, I don't give a shit.

44
00:03:22,389 --> 00:03:26,389
You can make fun of my baby shirt all you want.

45
00:03:26,389 --> 00:03:31,659
Just wait until you see me cook up a couple of dogs here.

46
00:03:31,659 --> 00:03:38,180
Alright, this music is going to drive me insane, I can already tell you that.

47
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:44,710
Are you in my game? No.

48
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:48,710
I'm going in. How do we do this?

49
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:53,020
I'm going in.

50
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:57,449
Is this frame rating? That's what I said. Do you have the window on your desktop?

51
00:03:57,449 --> 00:04:01,449
Did you close it or did you minimize it?

52
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:05,449
I didn't minimize it, I dragged it to almost non-existent.

53
00:04:05,449 --> 00:04:09,449
So I minimized it? Yeah. Open it up and shrink it.

54
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:14,139
And then my game stopped lagging. Really?

55
00:04:14,139 --> 00:04:19,850
Shrink it to barely existence and then move it off the screen?

56
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:24,660
Yeah. I have it as a 10 by 10 window.

57
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:28,660
That's very oddly specific how that is.

58
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:34,040
Did you minimize it after that?

59
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:39,180
Actually it is really frame rating. Maybe it's just the game.

60
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:44,629
I think it's just the game. We'll get in and see what happens.

61
00:04:44,629 --> 00:04:48,939
Because my CPU is at like 11%.

62
00:04:48,939 --> 00:04:52,939
My CPU is better than your CPU. That helped a lot actually.

63
00:04:52,939 --> 00:04:56,939
That fixed it for me. Yeah, dropping that.

64
00:04:56,939 --> 00:05:01,300
Let's go.

65
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:06,250
Play online. Invite?

66
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:11,240
Or should I just invite you?

67
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:15,540
You are none of these people.

68
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:21,939
Do you want to invite me?

69
00:05:21,939 --> 00:05:26,569
Play. Invite.

70
00:05:26,569 --> 00:05:33,420
Are you online?

71
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:37,420
What is this?

72
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:41,420
Am I cooking a stack of bacon? How do I get one piece of bacon?

73
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:45,420
Sure enough.

74
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:49,779
Are you online on Steam?

75
00:05:49,779 --> 00:05:54,470
I should be.

76
00:05:54,470 --> 00:06:01,850
I don't see anybody named Tommy Pickles.

77
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:08,889
I should be.

78
00:06:08,889 --> 00:06:12,889
I don't know how to do any of this.

79
00:06:12,889 --> 00:06:18,470
Why can I not open my Steam?

80
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:26,360
Why can I not open Steam?

81
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:36,550
I don't want to open a mobile hotspot.

82
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:40,920
You can spend weeks preparing.

83
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:47,019
I'm signed in now.

84
00:06:47,019 --> 00:06:51,899
You're online?

85
00:06:51,899 --> 00:06:55,899
Invite. There he is.

86
00:06:55,899 --> 00:07:13,639
Waiting for a friend. Meet me at the bar.

87
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:17,639
Okay, I'm here.

88
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:24,120
Friend invited you. Please yes, go.

89
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:28,120
Please yes, let's go.

90
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:32,120
Why am I this small? I'm not this small.

91
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:36,120
You are. No, I'm not this small.

92
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:40,810
Who is that? Is that us?

93
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:45,370
We just determined who us was.

94
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:49,370
Is this a surveillance camera of what we were doing?

95
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:54,250
We're getting orders.

96
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:58,810
Are you sure we're getting orders?

97
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:02,810
How do you play?

98
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:06,810
He wants a cup of busted and he wants a burger with

99
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:10,810
these customers.

100
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:14,810
These are pre-sliced?

101
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:18,810
Who does that?

102
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:22,810
You don't use your bare hand.

103
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:26,810
Where's my spatula?

104
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:30,810
He's down here.

105
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:39,129
That doesn't take very long at all.

106
00:08:39,129 --> 00:08:47,340
Where's the trash?

107
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:51,769
That's his group.

108
00:08:51,769 --> 00:08:57,220
There's going to be a fire.

109
00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:01,220
These take two seconds. We've got cheese, two buns.

110
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:05,399
Done. Bingo.

111
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:09,700
Cheese.

112
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:13,700
Cheese.

113
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:17,700
No, this is the wrong bun.

114
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:26,679
Where's the aioli?

115
00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:31,750
How do burgers burn this bad?

116
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:35,750
This one's easy. Shake this off.

117
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:48,740
Just burn it off.

118
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:54,230
It's going to be done.

119
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:58,230
Tutorials up.

120
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:02,730
I've got to toast these buns.

121
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:13,879
Where's the trash?

122
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:18,120
I just need

123
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:23,639
fresh hamburgers.

124
00:10:23,639 --> 00:10:31,460
I'm not agreeing with the physics.

125
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:35,460
How do I pick this up without it dropping?

126
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:39,460
I did that one.

127
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:49,450
I've got to season the grill.

128
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:56,230
What is in here?

129
00:10:56,230 --> 00:11:00,919
How did it go through the grate?

130
00:11:00,919 --> 00:11:04,919
I don't even know what that is.

131
00:11:04,919 --> 00:11:08,919
Will you come get this burger?

132
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:14,179
Right here. I got one right here for you.

133
00:11:14,179 --> 00:11:27,940
What?

134
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:32,179
Are we supposed to make all three on the screen?

135
00:11:32,179 --> 00:11:36,179
The ones that are right out here.

136
00:11:36,179 --> 00:11:46,870
How come it takes longer to fill a cup with a drink

137
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:50,870
than it does to cook a hamburger?

138
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:56,950
Because it's a fucking video game.

139
00:11:56,950 --> 00:12:02,009
Take it.

140
00:12:02,009 --> 00:12:06,009
How many red sixes do you have?

141
00:12:06,009 --> 00:12:10,009
I need a plate.

142
00:12:10,009 --> 00:12:14,009
I need a plate.

143
00:12:14,009 --> 00:12:18,009
What?

144
00:12:18,009 --> 00:12:24,340
This just came in.

145
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:28,340
I've done the thing.

146
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:32,340
Are these green?

147
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:36,649
Oh my god.

148
00:12:36,649 --> 00:12:40,649
Who needs plates?

149
00:12:40,649 --> 00:12:44,649
You're being back VR. Does that mean that she's grabbing you from behind

150
00:12:44,649 --> 00:12:48,649
and moving your shoulders?

151
00:12:48,649 --> 00:12:52,649
The air is making this fall. I didn't make that fall.

152
00:12:52,649 --> 00:13:02,039
What is doing this fall?

153
00:13:02,039 --> 00:13:07,799
I found out how to play.

154
00:13:07,799 --> 00:13:25,269
I'm serious. I don't know how to play the game.

155
00:13:25,269 --> 00:13:30,659
What do you mean you win?

156
00:13:30,659 --> 00:13:34,659
It's giving me the advanced super lag mode.

157
00:13:34,659 --> 00:13:38,659
What did you do?

158
00:13:38,659 --> 00:13:42,659
I got an order in.

159
00:13:42,659 --> 00:13:47,659
Why?

160
00:13:47,659 --> 00:13:55,220
I can't look at this.

161
00:13:55,220 --> 00:14:05,850
Play next match.

162
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:09,850
My board is blank.

163
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:13,850
It's the paddy. What is that? Did I do it?

164
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:18,789
I think I might have fucked up the game.

165
00:14:18,789 --> 00:14:24,620
I think the game is broken.

166
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:29,820
Why are these green?

167
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:33,820
This is getting weird.

168
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:38,379
I'm out of here.

169
00:14:38,379 --> 00:14:43,379
You're gone.

170
00:14:43,379 --> 00:14:48,519
We didn't get to do anything.

171
00:14:48,519 --> 00:15:02,600
My game doesn't work.

172
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:06,600
I invited you.

173
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:10,600
I think I see you operating a table.

174
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:14,600
Now invite me.

175
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:18,600
I didn't do anything.

176
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:32,179
Did something pop up?

177
00:15:32,179 --> 00:15:41,100
Did I invite shortboard?

178
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:45,100
I just got a message of what the fuck.

179
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:49,100
I'm pretty sure I clicked on you.

180
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:53,100
Can we play the next game?

181
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:57,100
Friend invite.

182
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:01,100
My game is still 10 frames a second.

183
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:05,100
Why are you persisting?

184
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:09,100
We can't do that.

185
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:13,720
That's going to cause real sickness.

186
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:17,720
I won.

187
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:22,470
I feel so much better to be in 60 fps.

188
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:27,159
What do you want to go next?

189
00:16:27,159 --> 00:16:32,470
Climbing?

190
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:36,470
Let's do climbing.

191
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:50,940
I don't know.

192
00:16:50,940 --> 00:17:01,370
Maybe.

193
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:06,630
We wait for him to return.

194
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:10,809
Video games are too hard.

195
00:17:10,809 --> 00:17:20,579
He's not in discord anymore.

196
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:27,619
Maybe that's what was causing all the lag.

197
00:17:27,619 --> 00:17:33,190
It's possible.

198
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:42,279
I wonder if he's going to come back.

199
00:17:42,279 --> 00:17:50,299
Do dreadhalls while you wait?

200
00:17:50,299 --> 00:17:54,299
I'll do tilt brush.

201
00:17:54,299 --> 00:18:06,710
I need to open my library.

202
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:14,650
Chef VR

203
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:18,650
blue screens his game.

204
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:25,880
He was underwater in that game for too long.

205
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:36,140
Let's open up tilt brush.

206
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:41,400
I've never played it before.

207
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:45,400
My computer

208
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:52,039
had an oopsie.

209
00:18:52,039 --> 00:18:57,369
That's probably what was killing us.

210
00:18:57,369 --> 00:19:01,369
Really?

211
00:19:01,369 --> 00:19:06,950
It wouldn't close.

212
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:12,900
My VR crashed.

213
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:17,589
Why? You just infected me.

214
00:19:17,589 --> 00:19:24,170
You infected me.

215
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:29,619
My OVR drop just crashed.

216
00:19:29,619 --> 00:19:35,190
Let's play that virus game again.

217
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:39,190
It keeps you there thinking you're making cheeseburgers.

218
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:46,380
Hold on.

219
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:51,240
Where's my hand?

220
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:59,750
I have to set this back up.

221
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:07,059
Where are you guys?

222
00:20:07,059 --> 00:20:11,059
I've got to load my chat profile.

223
00:20:11,059 --> 00:20:33,319
Why did the chef game have to do this to us?

224
00:20:33,319 --> 00:20:39,289
It completely logged me out of steam.

225
00:20:39,289 --> 00:20:43,289
It completely logged me out of steam. I don't know my password.

226
00:20:43,289 --> 00:20:49,640
Hold on. What are you talking about?

227
00:20:49,640 --> 00:21:01,339
Do you really get logged out of steam?

228
00:21:01,339 --> 00:21:06,539
How did you get logged out of steam?

229
00:21:06,539 --> 00:21:19,480
Tell me that I got my serial key and my card numbers.

230
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:26,500
For the love of god.

231
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:33,940
Technical difficulty stream welcome.

232
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:40,740
I had a profile saved.

233
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:51,509
Why is it not here?

234
00:21:51,509 --> 00:22:03,180
I'm playing the claw game right now.

235
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:17,109
Hopefully I win the big teddy bear.

236
00:22:17,109 --> 00:22:23,460
Why don't you have a stronger password?

237
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:33,619
Are you still here?

238
00:22:33,619 --> 00:22:42,329
Is he gone?

239
00:22:42,329 --> 00:22:48,339
He might be gone again.

240
00:22:48,339 --> 00:22:59,420
Are we infected?

241
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:09,660
I think he's the only one that's infected.

242
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:14,279
I'm going to open up tilt brush and wait for him to tell me everything is okay.

243
00:23:14,279 --> 00:23:33,589
This is actually kind of scary.

244
00:23:33,589 --> 00:23:41,400
I don't think we are infected.

245
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:52,549
Let's relax while we wait.

246
00:23:52,549 --> 00:24:01,130
The star is still technically in discord.

247
00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:05,299
Maybe when we figure it out, we'll hear him.

248
00:24:05,299 --> 00:24:12,279
That's not him.

249
00:24:12,279 --> 00:24:19,849
Let's see what this game is.

250
00:24:19,849 --> 00:24:26,839
Tilt brush. I heard it was very relaxing.

251
00:24:26,839 --> 00:24:32,470
Trigger to paint.

252
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:39,190
You hold the trigger down to paint.

253
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:46,630
This is unbelievable.

254
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:53,029
Swipe thumb pad.

255
00:24:53,029 --> 00:24:57,029
Straight edges.

256
00:24:57,029 --> 00:25:06,819
Mirror.

257
00:25:06,819 --> 00:25:11,579
Night sky.

258
00:25:11,579 --> 00:25:20,599
I'm going to make my t-shirt.

259
00:25:20,599 --> 00:25:24,599
How do I erase?

260
00:25:24,599 --> 00:25:32,779
That's really cool.

261
00:25:32,779 --> 00:25:40,579
Why does it keep changing?

262
00:25:40,579 --> 00:25:47,130
It's there.

263
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:51,500
Color pick.

264
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:55,500
What color do I want to smoke?

265
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:59,500
There's a little bit of smokiness here.

266
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:09,460
No, that's not going to work.

267
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:14,650
I need to make the brush bigger.

268
00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:21,769
How do I do that?

269
00:26:21,769 --> 00:26:26,390
Hard press left side of left touchpad to undo.

270
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:35,339
That looks good.

271
00:26:35,339 --> 00:26:39,339
I'm drawing my t-shirt now.

272
00:26:39,339 --> 00:26:49,450
You're having a little bit of trouble there.

273
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:55,029
There's my shirt.

274
00:26:55,029 --> 00:27:02,410
This is amazing.

275
00:27:02,410 --> 00:27:14,180
Can you come into my game and do this with me?

276
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:21,049
This is the real star. Do you want to play a game?

277
00:27:21,049 --> 00:27:25,539
Let's play Climbing.

278
00:27:25,539 --> 00:27:36,089
Snow?

279
00:27:36,089 --> 00:27:40,089
This is really cool. Unfortunately, star is back.

280
00:27:40,089 --> 00:27:44,710
I'm sorry.

281
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:49,019
Tilt brush.

282
00:27:49,019 --> 00:27:54,519
Medium are quite nice.

283
00:27:54,519 --> 00:28:00,230
Are you ready for climbing?

284
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:04,410
I am in climbing.

285
00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:10,099
I am sure about that.

286
00:28:10,099 --> 00:28:14,410
There was a foreign man at my front door.

287
00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:18,410
I gave him my social security and he said now I can play again.

288
00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:22,410
Is this you talking?

289
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:27,799
This is me talking.

290
00:28:27,799 --> 00:28:36,309
This is a weird scenario here.

291
00:28:36,309 --> 00:28:40,869
Are you ready to play this game together?

292
00:28:40,869 --> 00:28:44,869
I'm ready to play this game together.

293
00:28:44,869 --> 00:28:48,869
This is called Climbing and it's not what my current game title is.

294
00:28:48,869 --> 00:28:54,900
Floor, grid, clothes, robot, cam.

295
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:59,339
What does cam do?

296
00:28:59,339 --> 00:29:06,380
Turn off camera.

297
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:12,019
How do we get into the same game?

298
00:29:12,019 --> 00:29:16,710
Let's get started.

299
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:20,710
My camera is telling me I'm not live.

300
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:24,710
Now they're telling me I'm live.

301
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:28,710
I'm going to stream VR again.

302
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:39,720
He said grip and then what do we do?

303
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:43,720
Get the fuck out of my face.

304
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:47,720
Climb up using the trigger button.

305
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:54,460
This is really cool.

306
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:58,460
I sure wish one of my friends was around to play this with me.

307
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:02,460
Where's the tutorial?

308
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:06,460
Help me.

309
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:10,460
There's no start button.

310
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:15,720
Help me.

311
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:19,720
Where are you?

312
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:23,720
I'm in the big world.

313
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:27,720
Hold on.

314
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:31,720
I can't move.

315
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:35,720
I'm going to have to do this again.

316
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:39,720
I'm going to star the technically illiterate guy.

317
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:43,720
He doesn't even know how to set up his virtual headset.

318
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:49,430
How do I move?

319
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:53,430
This game is going to be real fun.

320
00:30:53,430 --> 00:30:57,430
It's like climbing.

321
00:30:57,430 --> 00:31:05,049
I made it.

322
00:31:05,049 --> 00:31:09,049
Jump climbing.

323
00:31:09,049 --> 00:31:13,049
Remember when Valve made games?

324
00:31:13,049 --> 00:31:17,049
Or when we made the portal?

325
00:31:17,049 --> 00:31:21,049
Am I in a tutorial?

326
00:31:21,049 --> 00:31:25,049
You have Wheatley talking to you.

327
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:31,460
Wheatley with the helmet on.

328
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:35,460
Do what Wheatley tells you and then we'll probably get into a game.

329
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:41,109
He's standing in front of me but he wants me to jump forward.

330
00:31:41,109 --> 00:31:49,640
Get out of me.

331
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:53,819
I already made that joke.

332
00:31:53,819 --> 00:32:00,920
What joke?

333
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:04,920
He's body blocking me.

334
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:16,490
How do I get out of here?

335
00:32:16,490 --> 00:32:23,539
Up there.

336
00:32:23,539 --> 00:32:31,859
You can't do that.

337
00:32:31,859 --> 00:32:37,319
Did you make it?

338
00:32:37,319 --> 00:32:43,210
Why are you like a baby?

339
00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:47,210
I just wanted things to work.

340
00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:51,210
It's a marvelous invention.

341
00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:56,150
Go for it.

342
00:32:56,150 --> 00:33:00,150
I have to complete the tutorial first.

343
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:16,089
Oh no.

344
00:33:16,089 --> 00:33:29,299
What?

345
00:33:29,299 --> 00:33:35,000
Listen to the baby.

346
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:39,619
Stop that. You want your bottle?

347
00:33:39,619 --> 00:33:50,329
I'm not doing that anymore.

348
00:33:50,329 --> 00:34:01,849
How do I get over there?

349
00:34:01,849 --> 00:34:05,849
Is this really a tutorial?

350
00:34:05,849 --> 00:34:09,849
It's teaching you how to climb and grab and move.

351
00:34:09,849 --> 00:34:13,849
It's a little more challenging than the others.

352
00:34:13,849 --> 00:34:17,849
Remember you can put that up to 3 checkpoints per level.

353
00:34:17,849 --> 00:34:21,849
If you just push the menu button.

354
00:34:21,849 --> 00:34:25,849
Checkpoints make it so you don't have to restart the entire level.

355
00:34:25,849 --> 00:34:29,849
Use them wisely and you'll be much less frustrated by difficult levels.

356
00:34:29,849 --> 00:34:33,849
Just stand on it.

357
00:34:33,849 --> 00:34:46,469
I almost ripped the headset off.

358
00:34:46,469 --> 00:34:54,980
This is actually fucking cool. You don't like this?

359
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:58,980
I just want to play with my friend.

360
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:05,000
I'm alone. I can't even see chat or anything.

361
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:13,769
I just feel like a dumbass.

362
00:35:13,769 --> 00:35:17,769
If you press the button to rotate while you're on the moving platform you fall off.

363
00:35:17,769 --> 00:35:22,010
What are you talking about?

364
00:35:22,010 --> 00:35:26,010
If you try and turn your character I just fall off.

365
00:35:26,010 --> 00:35:32,360
I'm almost done with the tutorial.

366
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:40,679
Good thing I can see my chat.

367
00:35:40,679 --> 00:35:48,599
I don't have a checkpoint.

368
00:35:48,599 --> 00:36:06,329
Am I okay?

369
00:36:06,329 --> 00:36:14,539
Just make sure to not orientate yourself and punch my wall.

370
00:36:14,539 --> 00:36:19,610
We have to work together and shit.

371
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:29,670
I don't even know where I am in my room.

372
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:46,820
Be careful.

373
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:52,280
How come every game you can't do a tutorial with a friend?

374
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:57,289
To give you confidence.

375
00:36:57,289 --> 00:37:13,670
I'm almost done with it.

376
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:17,980
This is the hard part.

377
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:28,090
Only two more of this shit and I'm good.

378
00:37:28,090 --> 00:37:35,510
Last one.

379
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:43,659
Let's try.

380
00:37:43,659 --> 00:37:47,659
Let you be free and play the game as you wish.

381
00:37:47,659 --> 00:37:51,659
In any sort of way.

382
00:37:51,659 --> 00:37:59,670
Not tutorial.

383
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:18,469
Set checkpoints with your wrist.

384
00:38:18,469 --> 00:38:22,780
How do I get this off?

385
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:28,659
Listen.

386
00:38:28,659 --> 00:38:36,090
Main menu.

387
00:38:36,090 --> 00:38:41,739
Servers.

388
00:38:41,739 --> 00:38:45,739
Go to the main menu.

389
00:38:45,739 --> 00:38:49,739
I'm doing my jumps.

390
00:38:49,739 --> 00:38:53,739
I'm doing my solo exercise.

391
00:38:53,739 --> 00:39:01,210
Start server browser.

392
00:39:01,210 --> 00:39:05,210
There are three people looking for a server.

393
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:11,739
I'm coming in your room.

394
00:39:11,739 --> 00:39:17,000
I'm joining you right now.

395
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:21,179
I feel like you lied to me.

396
00:39:21,179 --> 00:39:25,179
Open a room.

397
00:39:25,179 --> 00:39:29,179
You're going to have to explain.

398
00:39:29,179 --> 00:39:33,420
Select a level.

399
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:37,420
Start from the beginning.

400
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:41,420
Hit the menu button.

401
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:45,420
Activate main menu.

402
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:49,420
Select the built in ones.

403
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:59,420
My hand buzzes when I click main menu and I can't leave.

404
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:04,809
I'm in the main menu.

405
00:40:04,809 --> 00:40:08,809
I'm in the main menu.

406
00:40:08,809 --> 00:40:12,809
Go to built in mode.

407
00:40:12,809 --> 00:40:16,809
You have a selection of levels here.

408
00:40:16,809 --> 00:40:20,809
Click on 001 climbing 101.

409
00:40:20,809 --> 00:40:24,809
That's the first one.

410
00:40:24,809 --> 00:40:28,809
Do 002 jumping 101.

411
00:40:28,809 --> 00:40:32,809
Do 006 climb stuff.

412
00:40:32,809 --> 00:40:36,809
Get in there.

413
00:40:36,809 --> 00:40:47,380
Go.

414
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:51,380
New play.

415
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:57,289
Go to create private room.

416
00:40:57,289 --> 00:41:01,289
To the left.

417
00:41:01,289 --> 00:41:11,860
Create public, create private.

418
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:15,860
You're standing at the built in with all the buttons to press.

419
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:19,860
Go like this.

420
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:23,860
Go like what?

421
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:28,039
Movie, TV show.

422
00:41:28,039 --> 00:41:34,570
Seinfeld.

423
00:41:34,570 --> 00:41:39,130
Labyrinth.

424
00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:43,130
I only had a heart.

425
00:41:43,130 --> 00:41:48,780
Wizard of Oz.

426
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:53,139
Turn to your left.

427
00:41:53,139 --> 00:42:00,820
Create public and create private room.

428
00:42:00,820 --> 00:42:07,050
Sometimes with this guy, sometimes with him.

429
00:42:07,050 --> 00:42:11,739
I'm in.

430
00:42:11,739 --> 00:42:18,070
Turn around and see your new best friend.

431
00:42:18,070 --> 00:42:22,070
You can hear me in the game too, like every VR game.

432
00:42:22,070 --> 00:42:26,250
They don't expect you to be in a discord on a stream.

433
00:42:26,250 --> 00:42:33,739
Where's the options? Input.

434
00:42:33,739 --> 00:42:42,059
Mic, turn it off. To the top left.

435
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:46,059
It's me and you.

436
00:42:46,059 --> 00:42:51,829
What do I have to flare?

437
00:42:51,829 --> 00:42:55,829
The thing on your right shoulder strap.

438
00:42:55,829 --> 00:42:59,829
You have a thing that says vibe.

439
00:42:59,829 --> 00:43:03,829
Let's pick a level.

440
00:43:03,829 --> 00:43:08,780
Family guy joke.

441
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:13,510
Family guy routine.

442
00:43:13,510 --> 00:43:23,190
Pick one.

443
00:43:23,190 --> 00:43:30,119
It's going to be so funny.

444
00:43:30,119 --> 00:43:34,119
Can you pick a level?

445
00:43:34,119 --> 00:43:38,119
I'll do it.

446
00:43:38,119 --> 00:43:43,639
I don't understand.

447
00:43:43,639 --> 00:43:47,639
After selecting the levels you want, press the menu button.

448
00:43:47,639 --> 00:43:58,599
Don't read it.

449
00:43:58,599 --> 00:44:03,289
Just the way to get it so we can play.

450
00:44:03,289 --> 00:44:07,289
I see checkpoint on the top right.

451
00:44:07,289 --> 00:44:13,449
There's no start.

452
00:44:13,449 --> 00:44:22,860
It's levels that are available and they're calling you an idiot.

453
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:34,710
Top right.

454
00:44:34,710 --> 00:44:40,789
Look who the fool is.

455
00:44:40,789 --> 00:44:47,210
Look at this guy.

456
00:44:47,210 --> 00:44:51,210
There's no level selected.

457
00:44:51,210 --> 00:45:03,179
Don't touch anything.

458
00:45:03,179 --> 00:45:09,460
Player scale 1.5. Look up.

459
00:45:09,460 --> 00:45:13,769
We have a list here.

460
00:45:13,769 --> 00:45:21,980
Wait. Refresh.

461
00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:25,980
Can't we just start at 006?

462
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:29,980
Why did our games decide to undo everything that had been learned

463
00:45:29,980 --> 00:45:33,980
from making menus and UI in games?

464
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:45,559
Gullible is written on the ceiling.

465
00:45:45,559 --> 00:45:59,139
I'll handle this.

466
00:45:59,139 --> 00:46:05,030
You ready?

467
00:46:05,030 --> 00:46:09,030
I have a suggestion for the developers.

468
00:46:09,030 --> 00:46:13,030
This whole wall should be a button that says play.

469
00:46:13,030 --> 00:46:17,030
This one should be the mission you started.

470
00:46:17,030 --> 00:46:30,019
Turn off 1.5 times player scale.

471
00:46:30,019 --> 00:46:34,019
It's your lobby so you have to start the game.

472
00:46:34,019 --> 00:46:49,900
You have to open up your wrist watch menu and hit start.

473
00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:54,199
Nothing says start.

474
00:46:54,199 --> 00:46:59,780
We're here. 006.

475
00:46:59,780 --> 00:47:06,489
The trick is you press playlist.

476
00:47:06,489 --> 00:47:11,880
It's like I'm right next to you.

477
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:15,880
Are you going to do it?

478
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:19,880
Are you going to do this or are we going to just

479
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:30,090
get the fuck away from him?

480
00:47:30,090 --> 00:47:40,820
You just fucking threw me over.

481
00:47:40,820 --> 00:47:45,130
What the hell are you standing on?

482
00:47:45,130 --> 00:47:52,039
How come I can't see you on that?

483
00:47:52,039 --> 00:47:58,739
That's my real wall.

484
00:47:58,739 --> 00:48:05,480
Be careful. Watch out for the wall.

485
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:13,239
That's my wall.

486
00:48:13,239 --> 00:48:21,639
That's my VR sensor.

487
00:48:21,639 --> 00:48:43,019
He's breaking his shit. I'll get over there quick.

488
00:48:43,019 --> 00:49:02,150
I almost fucked it up.

489
00:49:02,150 --> 00:49:26,889
What?

490
00:49:26,889 --> 00:49:36,090
Crawl you fool.

491
00:49:36,090 --> 00:49:42,699
Why do I not have a checkpoint?

492
00:49:42,699 --> 00:49:50,119
You thought you were going to beat me.

493
00:49:50,119 --> 00:49:54,940
I grabbed it.

494
00:49:54,940 --> 00:50:03,659
A store has a checkpoint there.

495
00:50:03,659 --> 00:50:07,659
We both have our own checkpoints.

496
00:50:07,659 --> 00:50:11,960
Make your checkpoint.

497
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:20,340
I didn't know how to do it.

498
00:50:20,340 --> 00:50:24,340
Me getting to the end doesn't end the level.

499
00:50:24,340 --> 00:50:29,610
I'll get there. I was just rushing because I was trying to beat you.

500
00:50:29,610 --> 00:50:41,130
You didn't.

501
00:50:41,130 --> 00:50:46,519
Here I am at the checkpoint.

502
00:50:46,519 --> 00:50:59,750
Where is it?

503
00:50:59,750 --> 00:51:04,500
Tommy Pickles.

504
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:08,500
I didn't know what it was.

505
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:16,199
What am I touching?

506
00:51:16,199 --> 00:51:31,559
Wait over here for you.

507
00:51:31,559 --> 00:51:35,559
I'm trying to rush so much.

508
00:51:35,559 --> 00:51:39,559
It's next level.

509
00:51:39,559 --> 00:51:51,960
Are you ready?

510
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:55,960
That's what Mario would do.

511
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:59,960
I'm sliding.

512
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:06,809
You're trying too hard.

513
00:52:06,809 --> 00:52:11,619
I'm not doing anything.

514
00:52:11,619 --> 00:52:16,059
I'm just being pushed around.

515
00:52:16,059 --> 00:52:21,449
Are you lacking again?

516
00:52:21,449 --> 00:52:31,219
There you are.

517
00:52:31,219 --> 00:52:35,219
That's an interesting long way to go.

518
00:52:35,219 --> 00:52:44,139
This is going to be really interesting here.

519
00:52:44,139 --> 00:52:53,610
You're going to have to climb.

520
00:52:53,610 --> 00:53:07,670
I don't think I like this.

521
00:53:07,670 --> 00:53:12,940
I don't think you should be playing this one.

522
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:27,590
You can't do that.

523
00:53:27,590 --> 00:53:32,340
I'm going to wrap all the way around.

524
00:53:32,340 --> 00:53:36,340
How are you hitting the ceiling?

525
00:53:36,340 --> 00:53:40,340
You're not nine feet tall, are you?

526
00:53:40,340 --> 00:53:45,400
How are you touching your ceiling?

527
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:54,119
I'm going to freak out.

528
00:53:54,119 --> 00:54:00,070
Your arms are longer than mine.

529
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:08,659
Can I put a checkpoint here?

530
00:54:08,659 --> 00:54:17,690
You're going to make me let go.

531
00:54:17,690 --> 00:54:29,719
From here?

532
00:54:29,719 --> 00:55:01,989
No!

533
00:55:01,989 --> 00:55:07,190
What?

534
00:55:07,190 --> 00:55:11,690
Sometimes you just need to put the radio on and relax.

535
00:55:11,690 --> 00:55:19,619
What do I do from here?

536
00:55:19,619 --> 00:55:36,860
No!

537
00:55:36,860 --> 00:55:41,800
He hit his head on the ceiling and I forgot you could do that.

538
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:46,099
I even mentioned it.

539
00:55:46,099 --> 00:55:50,980
Can I make a checkpoint here?

540
00:55:50,980 --> 00:55:56,889
It broke his ceiling light and distracted me.

541
00:55:56,889 --> 00:56:08,980
I'm out of checkpoints.

542
00:56:08,980 --> 00:56:23,619
This radio sucks.

543
00:56:23,619 --> 00:56:29,780
Where even are you?

544
00:56:29,780 --> 00:56:34,659
I went all the way to the beginning because it didn't make one checkpoint.

545
00:56:34,659 --> 00:56:38,659
You started smashing stuff and I forgot it was a game.

546
00:56:38,659 --> 00:56:50,650
I hit the wall and I don't know what hand is gripped.

547
00:56:50,650 --> 00:56:55,699
Which one of these hands is gripping the ceiling?

548
00:56:55,699 --> 00:57:02,380
I have no idea.

549
00:57:02,380 --> 00:57:12,889
Why does the game move you when you're in a spot?

550
00:57:12,889 --> 00:57:16,889
Give me a checkpoint.

551
00:57:16,889 --> 00:57:23,099
I'm going to put a checkpoint right on top of that.

552
00:57:23,099 --> 00:57:31,110
Minutes.

553
00:57:31,110 --> 00:57:35,349
Next level.

554
00:57:35,349 --> 00:57:39,719
I got to the end.

555
00:57:39,719 --> 00:57:45,369
I did the whole thing.

556
00:57:45,369 --> 00:57:49,539
You're a liar.

557
00:57:49,539 --> 00:57:53,980
I came back because getting to the end doesn't end it.

558
00:57:53,980 --> 00:57:58,539
I see what happened.

559
00:57:58,539 --> 00:58:05,829
Movie.

560
00:58:05,829 --> 00:58:11,159
Ow!

561
00:58:11,159 --> 00:58:15,159
This is the number one punch your wall game.

562
00:58:15,159 --> 00:58:23,610
How do we keep doing that?

563
00:58:23,610 --> 00:58:36,780
I got cute with it.

564
00:58:36,780 --> 00:58:43,000
Are we going through?

565
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:58,139
I'm coming.

566
00:58:58,139 --> 00:59:02,739
How do we do this?

567
00:59:02,739 --> 00:59:13,860
Are you putting a checkpoint here?

568
00:59:13,860 --> 00:59:22,059
VR notifications.

569
00:59:22,059 --> 00:59:29,159
Get away from me.

570
00:59:29,159 --> 00:59:42,789
No, I didn't put a checkpoint.

571
00:59:42,789 --> 00:59:46,789
Why do you keep doing that?

572
00:59:46,789 --> 00:59:50,789
I don't know.

573
00:59:50,789 --> 00:59:54,789
I pushed you off the mountain and I forgot.

574
00:59:54,789 --> 01:00:02,550
I was going to put one down right there.

575
01:00:02,550 --> 01:00:06,550
Why do I keep doing this?

576
01:00:06,550 --> 01:00:12,760
I beat it.

577
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:21,030
I don't know where I am in my room.

578
01:00:21,030 --> 01:00:28,730
Just go.

579
01:00:28,730 --> 01:00:37,690
Unbelievable.

580
01:00:37,690 --> 01:00:45,900
Why don't you near me?

581
01:00:45,900 --> 01:01:08,460
That's weird.

582
01:01:08,460 --> 01:01:25,800
What's the goal here?

583
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:34,440
Ow!

584
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:38,440
How many holes are we going to have on our walls?

585
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:49,849
Weird sex music playing.

586
01:01:49,849 --> 01:01:55,690
Ow!

587
01:01:55,690 --> 01:02:01,130
We're going to break something.

588
01:02:01,130 --> 01:02:07,349
What are you jumping to?

589
01:02:07,349 --> 01:02:11,349
Why am I jumping sideways?

590
01:02:11,349 --> 01:02:24,099
How do I jump backwards?

591
01:02:24,099 --> 01:02:29,110
I got a checkpoint.

592
01:02:29,110 --> 01:02:49,909
How do you do this?

593
01:02:49,909 --> 01:02:57,210
Oh my goodness.

594
01:02:57,210 --> 01:03:04,010
I'm in the opposite direction of what I'm trying to do.

595
01:03:04,010 --> 01:03:09,380
I can hold onto you.

596
01:03:09,380 --> 01:03:17,769
How did you do that?

597
01:03:17,769 --> 01:03:28,059
I had more attempts.

598
01:03:28,059 --> 01:03:32,059
Don't do it yet.

599
01:03:32,059 --> 01:03:37,300
It's so difficult.

600
01:03:37,300 --> 01:03:49,610
Don't go.

601
01:03:49,610 --> 01:03:58,010
Don't do anything.

602
01:03:58,010 --> 01:04:08,250
I'm saving you a lot of embarrassment.

603
01:04:08,250 --> 01:04:17,420
You're going under.

604
01:04:17,420 --> 01:04:25,739
The level is over under.

605
01:04:25,739 --> 01:04:38,420
How is he doing this to me?

606
01:04:38,420 --> 01:04:44,329
I was planning and correcting.

607
01:04:44,329 --> 01:04:53,460
Where is this going?

608
01:04:53,460 --> 01:04:58,460
Are there no checkpoints here?

609
01:04:58,460 --> 01:05:02,460
I tried to press it.

610
01:05:02,460 --> 01:05:12,039
I'm going under.

611
01:05:12,039 --> 01:05:19,269
Under this.

612
01:05:19,269 --> 01:05:27,210
There was a movement platform here.

613
01:05:27,210 --> 01:05:35,780
On the side?

614
01:05:35,780 --> 01:05:45,769
That just booted me.

615
01:05:45,769 --> 01:05:50,650
Did you stuff yourself under here?

616
01:05:50,650 --> 01:05:55,079
I feel dizzy as hell now.

617
01:05:55,079 --> 01:05:59,320
My face. Are you lying to me or did you actually do that?

618
01:05:59,320 --> 01:06:08,840
I did.

619
01:06:08,840 --> 01:06:16,730
Remember when we used to have an honest relationship?

620
01:06:16,730 --> 01:06:33,099
Down.

621
01:06:33,099 --> 01:06:39,940
Where am I?

622
01:06:39,940 --> 01:06:47,050
Where am I?

623
01:06:47,050 --> 01:06:51,050
I feel like I went back to the beginning.

624
01:06:51,050 --> 01:07:16,039
Crawl?

625
01:07:16,039 --> 01:07:25,769
Why is this working?

626
01:07:25,769 --> 01:07:34,920
It was a good thing there wasn't a wall in front of me.

627
01:07:34,920 --> 01:07:43,179
I beat it.

628
01:07:43,179 --> 01:07:49,139
I couldn't figure out the crawl thing.

629
01:07:49,139 --> 01:07:57,510
I'm dizzy.

630
01:07:57,510 --> 01:08:01,510
I'm going to check in on my chat.

631
01:08:01,510 --> 01:08:06,070
Lose in a children's game.

632
01:08:06,070 --> 01:08:25,130
This is a workout.

633
01:08:25,130 --> 01:08:39,909
Oops.

634
01:08:39,909 --> 01:08:44,149
Lose in a children's game.

635
01:08:44,149 --> 01:08:57,539
I see your final checkpoint.

636
01:08:57,539 --> 01:09:19,430
Be easy with this shit.

637
01:09:19,430 --> 01:09:27,619
How's your chat doing?

638
01:09:27,619 --> 01:09:39,850
They're great.

639
01:09:39,850 --> 01:09:45,989
I'm going to assume I should use it right here.

640
01:09:45,989 --> 01:10:02,300
Hard jump.

641
01:10:02,300 --> 01:10:09,720
How many more are there?

642
01:10:09,720 --> 01:10:21,560
There it is.

643
01:10:21,560 --> 01:10:41,000
Should I put on the dumb music too?

644
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:51,140
No.

645
01:10:51,140 --> 01:11:06,789
How did you get to this?

646
01:11:06,789 --> 01:11:10,789
Am I actually going to get Lose commercial?

647
01:11:10,789 --> 01:11:14,789
Are you kidding me?

648
01:11:14,789 --> 01:11:18,789
This is a real radio station?

649
01:11:18,789 --> 01:11:22,789
This is a real radio station?

650
01:11:22,789 --> 01:11:26,789
What are you doing?

651
01:11:26,789 --> 01:11:30,789
Did you get a Lose advertisement?

652
01:11:30,789 --> 01:11:34,789
No.

653
01:11:34,789 --> 01:11:44,789
What is this?

654
01:11:44,789 --> 01:11:51,640
What's your plan?

655
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:55,640
Are you ready?

656
01:11:55,640 --> 01:12:06,979
You sweaty?

657
01:12:06,979 --> 01:12:12,420
I did it.

658
01:12:12,420 --> 01:12:18,970
This is my chance to show everybody that I have what it takes.

659
01:12:18,970 --> 01:12:29,140
You say one thing about it.

660
01:12:29,140 --> 01:12:35,239
This shit's moving.

661
01:12:35,239 --> 01:12:44,220
The moving platform is freaking me out.

662
01:12:44,220 --> 01:12:49,859
I think I'm on top.

663
01:12:49,859 --> 01:13:00,039
It's weird.

664
01:13:00,039 --> 01:13:05,430
I think there is ice.

665
01:13:05,430 --> 01:13:15,819
This is ice.

666
01:13:15,819 --> 01:13:27,220
That's hard.

667
01:13:27,220 --> 01:13:40,260
What the hell?

668
01:13:40,260 --> 01:13:59,899
That was too fast.

669
01:13:59,899 --> 01:14:03,899
This is awful.

670
01:14:03,899 --> 01:14:11,140
I can't do it.

671
01:14:11,140 --> 01:14:17,020
I can't do it.

672
01:14:17,020 --> 01:14:25,399
Did I win?

673
01:14:25,399 --> 01:14:32,779
You're going to win.

674
01:14:32,779 --> 01:14:42,819
Touching the flag doesn't do anything.

675
01:14:42,819 --> 01:14:49,930
Can I hold onto the flag?

676
01:14:49,930 --> 01:14:57,750
I didn't get to complete that.

677
01:14:57,750 --> 01:15:01,750
I thought you said you were at the end.

678
01:15:01,750 --> 01:15:18,899
You took it from me.

679
01:15:18,899 --> 01:15:30,420
I've got to wait a long time.

680
01:15:30,420 --> 01:15:34,420
Let's just stand and skip.

681
01:15:34,420 --> 01:15:39,500
We need to skip.

682
01:15:39,500 --> 01:15:44,500
This is the level where you wait in an elevator.

683
01:15:44,500 --> 01:15:48,680
What am I supposed to do? Patience?

684
01:15:48,680 --> 01:15:56,949
That's hard.

685
01:15:56,949 --> 01:16:16,010
Can I stop?

686
01:16:16,010 --> 01:16:21,020
This is Mario 64 shit.

687
01:16:21,020 --> 01:16:30,020
You don't want to go that fast.

688
01:16:30,020 --> 01:16:34,970
Look at this shit.

689
01:16:34,970 --> 01:16:40,039
Look at this.

690
01:16:40,039 --> 01:16:51,060
I'm throwing up.

691
01:16:51,060 --> 01:17:11,800
Easy.

692
01:17:11,800 --> 01:17:17,380
I feel like this is going to be worse than elevators.

693
01:17:17,380 --> 01:17:28,899
I think you better set to go for it.

694
01:17:28,899 --> 01:17:33,770
Wait a minute.

695
01:17:33,770 --> 01:17:43,189
No.

696
01:17:43,189 --> 01:17:54,899
Go for it.

697
01:17:54,899 --> 01:18:00,659
That's so weird. I think you have to do it really slow.

698
01:18:00,659 --> 01:18:06,869
Like a snail's crawl.

699
01:18:06,869 --> 01:18:16,600
I can't do that turn slowly.

700
01:18:16,600 --> 01:18:20,600
The force you need to do it right angle sends me flying.

701
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:24,970
Just walk.

702
01:18:24,970 --> 01:18:31,109
I'm going to mean just walk.

703
01:18:31,109 --> 01:18:36,619
Walk backwards.

704
01:18:36,619 --> 01:19:01,189
Wait. Hold on. That was close.

705
01:19:01,189 --> 01:19:05,189
Grip and just pull.

706
01:19:05,189 --> 01:19:09,189
Grip and pull.

707
01:19:09,189 --> 01:19:15,539
See how fucking you just start flying.

708
01:19:15,539 --> 01:19:21,060
Hold grips and swing arms.

709
01:19:21,060 --> 01:19:41,369
No.

710
01:19:41,369 --> 01:19:58,180
Wait.

711
01:19:58,180 --> 01:20:02,180
I'm practicing for a while.

712
01:20:02,180 --> 01:20:06,869
It's grips.

713
01:20:06,869 --> 01:20:12,840
Grip not triggers grips.

714
01:20:12,840 --> 01:20:36,970
I don't want to mess up my strategy.

715
01:20:36,970 --> 01:20:40,970
Cranking.

716
01:20:40,970 --> 01:20:59,020
I'm just like the orangutan.

717
01:20:59,020 --> 01:21:03,319
You're like the mom.

718
01:21:03,319 --> 01:21:27,750
You're the mom orangutan and I'm like the baby.

719
01:21:27,750 --> 01:21:35,500
Get off of me.

720
01:21:35,500 --> 01:21:42,739
That thing makes you fall backwards.

721
01:21:42,739 --> 01:21:50,890
Get us out.

722
01:21:50,890 --> 01:22:10,409
Slow down.

723
01:22:10,409 --> 01:22:14,840
I just hurt my back.

724
01:22:14,840 --> 01:22:19,210
My back hurts.

725
01:22:19,210 --> 01:22:26,779
Sit the next one up.

726
01:22:26,779 --> 01:22:31,460
I think I was going to do the shake thing.

727
01:22:31,460 --> 01:22:39,319
I hit the ceiling.

728
01:22:39,319 --> 01:22:43,819
I have to go to a chiropractor and have him do the fucking

729
01:22:43,819 --> 01:22:51,829
undertaker move where he breaks my back.

730
01:22:51,829 --> 01:22:55,829
I want to go to a chiropractor that gives me a fucking tombstone.

731
01:22:55,829 --> 01:23:00,520
Just bring me to a fucking cane.

732
01:23:00,520 --> 01:23:05,460
Scoop me up and do the fucking tombstone piledriver to me.

733
01:23:05,460 --> 01:23:09,640
Just end it.

734
01:23:09,640 --> 01:23:29,079
Are we playing ping pong?

735
01:23:29,079 --> 01:23:33,510
Bounce. Bounce you stupid game. Dumb.

736
01:23:33,510 --> 01:23:39,420
This game is so dumb.

737
01:23:39,420 --> 01:23:43,420
I'm actually really surprised that we're still playing this and I'm having fun.

738
01:23:43,420 --> 01:23:48,489
I expected this game to be.

739
01:23:48,489 --> 01:23:53,560
Somebody in chat last night said you should guys play climbing.

740
01:23:53,560 --> 01:23:57,560
They said you'd probably get a couple of fun interesting orangutan on the mother jokes.

741
01:23:57,560 --> 01:24:06,069
That sounds like a good idea.

742
01:24:06,069 --> 01:24:16,550
I win. I win.

743
01:24:16,550 --> 01:24:21,670
I win. Are you literally jumping?

744
01:24:21,670 --> 01:24:46,100
Stop. Don't go yet.

745
01:24:46,100 --> 01:24:50,859
Are you sure you want me to end this?

746
01:24:50,859 --> 01:24:55,539
Dermot was just joking. He could beat that level any time he wants.

747
01:24:55,539 --> 01:25:07,909
That was the one. High five.

748
01:25:07,909 --> 01:25:11,909
I just actually put that in my fucking mouth.

749
01:25:11,909 --> 01:25:16,539
Tongue in mouth.

750
01:25:16,539 --> 01:25:21,670
You're not going to get me are you?

751
01:25:21,670 --> 01:25:28,600
Get me up to the summit. I'm just like the parrot that you bring with you that Grant's wishes.

752
01:25:28,600 --> 01:25:39,979
The parrot.

753
01:25:39,979 --> 01:25:47,989
I love the parrot that Grant's wishes.

754
01:25:47,989 --> 01:25:52,869
Excuse me. Not that fast.

755
01:25:52,869 --> 01:25:59,029
Get on my back. Why did you push me sir?

756
01:25:59,029 --> 01:26:03,029
I was putting a check point down and you pushed me. You can't push.

757
01:26:03,029 --> 01:26:07,029
You pushed me. You did. I promise.

758
01:26:07,029 --> 01:26:11,029
I bet you 500 cents.

759
01:26:11,029 --> 01:26:15,960
Call my lawyer. You didn't have a lawyer. I know this because I've sued you before.

760
01:26:15,960 --> 01:26:19,960
And won easily. You showed up there. You showed up in a fucking tank top

761
01:26:19,960 --> 01:26:23,960
in pants suits.

762
01:26:23,960 --> 01:26:27,960
In a fucking chicken costume.

763
01:26:27,960 --> 01:26:32,520
Underneath?

764
01:26:32,520 --> 01:26:36,520
Yeah. Underneath.

765
01:26:36,520 --> 01:26:45,800
I was in a suit under that chicken costume.

766
01:26:45,800 --> 01:26:52,539
Mom, I don't want to do this part.

767
01:26:52,539 --> 01:26:59,899
I feel like that's you on every level.

768
01:26:59,899 --> 01:27:12,119
What?

769
01:27:12,119 --> 01:27:16,119
I don't want to get thrown off while I make a check point. That would be sweet.

770
01:27:16,119 --> 01:27:26,359
Thank you.

771
01:27:26,359 --> 01:27:31,300
You know what I'm really concerned about with VR?

772
01:27:31,300 --> 01:27:35,300
I win.

773
01:27:35,300 --> 01:27:39,300
When you have a VR helmet on

774
01:27:39,300 --> 01:27:43,539
I hear that cheering.

775
01:27:43,539 --> 01:27:49,579
And it's infuriating me.

776
01:27:49,579 --> 01:27:53,579
When you have a VR headset on

777
01:27:53,579 --> 01:27:57,579
You know how the glass is really really close to your eyes, right?

778
01:27:57,579 --> 01:28:01,579
It's literally right here.

779
01:28:01,579 --> 01:28:05,579
Not that it fogs up. I'm talking about

780
01:28:05,579 --> 01:28:09,579
I kind of have this weird concern that you know how you accidentally

781
01:28:09,579 --> 01:28:13,579
smash your face into a wall and you bump your controller into your face?

782
01:28:13,579 --> 01:28:17,819
What's the testing? Have they done extensive safety testing where if

783
01:28:17,819 --> 01:28:21,819
I punch my face accidentally and the glass shatters it's not going to shoot into my eyes?

784
01:28:21,819 --> 01:28:25,819
No.

785
01:28:25,819 --> 01:28:29,819
What if it just explodes the glass straight into your eyes?

786
01:28:29,819 --> 01:28:34,060
Have they done tests of that yet?

787
01:28:34,060 --> 01:28:40,340
Or are we the test subjects because VR is not really caught on yet?

788
01:28:40,340 --> 01:28:45,399
You're so smart. Okay, next level.

789
01:28:45,399 --> 01:28:53,529
We win.

790
01:28:53,529 --> 01:28:58,149
This is like a safety glass.

791
01:28:58,149 --> 01:29:04,859
Is there a level that we didn't do?

792
01:29:04,859 --> 01:29:12,939
We did skyscraper?

793
01:29:12,939 --> 01:29:16,939
We did it, we beat it.

794
01:29:16,939 --> 01:29:21,819
There's like an open workshop button.

795
01:29:21,819 --> 01:29:25,819
Let's take a little chat poll here.

796
01:29:25,819 --> 01:29:29,989
What do you guys think?

797
01:29:29,989 --> 01:29:33,989
Star does really well while I pretend to grab onto him as a baby monkey?

798
01:29:33,989 --> 01:29:39,380
No matter what game we play that's going to happen.

799
01:29:39,380 --> 01:29:44,840
Is my cam's frame rate wrong here?

800
01:29:44,840 --> 01:30:00,069
Why is my camera's frame rate fucking off?

801
01:30:00,069 --> 01:30:05,210
That's weird.

802
01:30:05,210 --> 01:30:12,710
I think everyone wants us to move on.

803
01:30:12,710 --> 01:30:18,409
Pavlov, we also have

804
01:30:18,409 --> 01:30:24,819
The Lost Colony.

805
01:30:24,819 --> 01:30:32,180
We should probably end on Pavlov because we'll probably be in that for a little while.

806
01:30:32,180 --> 01:30:36,180
We had chef game that turned out to hack your computer.

807
01:30:36,180 --> 01:30:40,869
You want to take a quick little piss break?

808
01:30:40,869 --> 01:30:46,439
I'm a gamer, so I'm ready.

809
01:30:46,439 --> 01:30:51,579
You can take a break.

810
01:30:51,579 --> 01:30:58,039
I'm afraid it's going to break and shatter into my eyes.

811
01:30:58,039 --> 01:31:03,100
Let's do Pulsar.

812
01:31:03,100 --> 01:31:07,100
I have the lowest expectations for Pulsar.

813
01:31:07,100 --> 01:31:12,550
But I'm coming in with an open mind.

814
01:31:12,550 --> 01:31:16,550
I just get the vibe it's going to be NPC talking to people, reading boards.

815
01:31:16,550 --> 01:31:20,550
I don't know why.

816
01:31:20,550 --> 01:31:24,550
I can't read, you know that about me.

817
01:31:24,550 --> 01:31:29,109
Did somebody just say you literally cannot play this game without five people?

818
01:31:29,109 --> 01:31:33,109
It is driving a ship, so I also worried.

819
01:31:33,109 --> 01:31:38,250
You physically can't play this without five people.

820
01:31:38,250 --> 01:31:47,079
Pavlov does kind of need it. Can't we do all of it?

821
01:31:47,079 --> 01:31:52,149
Just do three stream snipers.

822
01:31:52,149 --> 01:31:56,949
Let's just do Pavy.

823
01:31:56,949 --> 01:32:02,409
You don't even want to give that a try?

824
01:32:02,409 --> 01:32:09,960
Not really.

825
01:32:09,960 --> 01:32:13,960
Whatever you want to do.

826
01:32:13,960 --> 01:32:17,960
Since we played VR last week, I've been waiting to do this again.

827
01:32:17,960 --> 01:32:23,350
I'm really excited.

828
01:32:23,350 --> 01:32:27,350
You've got a hot mic right now.

829
01:32:27,350 --> 01:32:33,449
Don't talk about your credit card.

830
01:32:33,449 --> 01:35:44,920
Hey, what's up? Hot mic.

831
01:35:44,920 --> 01:35:55,460
Don't say credit card.

832
01:35:55,460 --> 01:36:01,210
Don't say the word credit card.

833
01:36:01,210 --> 01:36:06,579
Wait, was I on hot mic before?

834
01:36:06,579 --> 01:36:11,270
Are you sure?

835
01:36:11,270 --> 01:36:15,270
I know you were streaming.

836
01:36:15,270 --> 01:36:19,899
I'm streaming, yes.

837
01:36:19,899 --> 01:36:25,140
Probably shouldn't have done that.

838
01:36:25,140 --> 01:36:32,489
I'll just cancel it.

839
01:36:32,489 --> 01:36:36,729
You'd rather cancel your credit card than cancel payments?

840
01:36:36,729 --> 01:36:40,729
You know how you said we were definitely not done playing EDF

841
01:36:40,729 --> 01:36:45,100
and then you never played it again?

842
01:36:45,100 --> 01:36:49,100
I still have the PlayStation subscription, but my PlayStation is completely unplugged.

843
01:36:49,100 --> 01:36:53,829
The only way to cancel it is to plug it all back in.

844
01:36:53,829 --> 01:36:57,829
Then I still wouldn't get to play EDF.

845
01:36:57,829 --> 01:37:03,609
Pavlov!

846
01:37:03,609 --> 01:37:07,609
Which one are we doing? Pavlov or Pulsar?

847
01:37:07,609 --> 01:37:11,779
They both start with P and have Ls in them.

848
01:37:11,779 --> 01:37:15,779
Honestly, I think it's going to take 30 minutes

849
01:37:15,779 --> 01:37:19,779
to set up a VR game, tradition has shown, and then we're going to play Pavlov for 10.

850
01:37:19,779 --> 01:37:25,239
I mean not Pavlov, Pulsar.

851
01:37:25,239 --> 01:37:29,239
I'm opening Pavlov right now.

852
01:37:29,239 --> 01:37:36,659
He just doesn't want to play Pulsar.

853
01:37:36,659 --> 01:37:42,810
Can we get a handful of screenshots

854
01:37:42,810 --> 01:37:46,810
of every time I have the helmet off in VR?

855
01:37:46,810 --> 01:37:51,050
I want them compared in a collage.

856
01:37:51,050 --> 01:37:58,279
Whoever has the technology to screenshot a screen,

857
01:37:58,279 --> 01:38:02,840
just use it wisely.

858
01:38:02,840 --> 01:38:08,409
Alright, I'm closing this. Calami was fun.

859
01:38:08,409 --> 01:38:15,319
It was worth playing. 10 bucks. Pretty cheap.

860
01:38:15,319 --> 01:38:26,520
It's still there.

861
01:38:26,520 --> 01:38:32,789
People can hear you, right?

862
01:38:32,789 --> 01:38:37,340
I feel like we'll be in Pavlov for a little while.

863
01:38:37,340 --> 01:38:43,369
I'm launching it as we speak.

864
01:38:43,369 --> 01:38:47,369
Not yet.

865
01:38:47,369 --> 01:38:55,619
Ow, my knees!

866
01:38:55,619 --> 01:39:02,789
I'm excited!

867
01:39:02,789 --> 01:39:06,789
I just heard a gnome.

868
01:39:06,789 --> 01:39:11,989
Did you guys hear that?

869
01:39:11,989 --> 01:39:25,300
I'm not insane.

870
01:39:25,300 --> 01:39:30,380
That's a bad place to put this.

871
01:39:30,380 --> 01:39:37,350
Are you good?

872
01:39:37,350 --> 01:39:43,000
My stream is showing the SteamVR menu,

873
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:48,779
but I'm in the game.

874
01:39:48,779 --> 01:40:03,640
What do you want me to do?

875
01:40:03,640 --> 01:40:08,460
I'm trying again. What do you want me to do?

876
01:40:08,460 --> 01:40:12,460
Let me just get in my headset.

877
01:40:12,460 --> 01:40:16,460
I'm trying to get air.

878
01:40:16,460 --> 01:40:22,859
There's no oxygen in this mask.

879
01:40:22,859 --> 01:40:27,979
I don't know if I can do this.

880
01:40:27,979 --> 01:40:32,340
Pavlov is working for you?

881
01:40:32,340 --> 01:40:37,720
I got it.

882
01:40:37,720 --> 01:40:44,460
That's what I'm saying. My Oculus is showing inside Pavlov.

883
01:40:44,460 --> 01:40:48,460
How did you launch it?

884
01:40:48,460 --> 01:40:52,949
Launch it in SteamVR and launch it in OculusVR.

885
01:40:52,949 --> 01:41:00,180
I launched it in SteamVR.

886
01:41:00,180 --> 01:41:04,180
Let me try launching it from the Steam couch room.

887
01:41:04,180 --> 01:41:08,180
Probably a good idea.

888
01:41:08,180 --> 01:41:12,180
I'm getting one last sip.

889
01:41:12,180 --> 01:41:27,590
It says you're playing it.

890
01:41:27,590 --> 01:41:32,779
You don't understand the problem.

891
01:41:32,779 --> 01:41:37,460
I don't think I can get this to work at all.

892
01:41:37,460 --> 01:41:43,739
I have no idea what to do.

893
01:41:43,739 --> 01:41:48,550
What if you open it in OculusVR?

894
01:41:48,550 --> 01:41:53,689
The game launches yet.

895
01:41:53,689 --> 01:41:57,930
My screen is showing something that is not happening.

896
01:41:57,930 --> 01:42:04,260
Really?

897
01:42:04,260 --> 01:42:10,149
It's like an infinite loading screen on my screen.

898
01:42:10,149 --> 01:42:15,460
Do you want to try something else?

899
01:42:15,460 --> 01:42:19,460
I'm going to try one thing and see if I can add it as an Oculus game and launch it from Oculus.

900
01:42:19,460 --> 01:42:24,970
Hey everyone, buy an Oculus.

901
01:42:24,970 --> 01:42:33,609
Keep hearing the note.

902
01:42:33,609 --> 01:42:38,550
That's a joke where you're not supposed to buy an Oculus.

903
01:42:38,550 --> 01:42:43,050
Press menu plus trigger to open the game menu.

904
01:42:43,050 --> 01:42:51,960
That's me.

905
01:42:51,960 --> 01:42:56,899
That's because it's this.

906
01:42:56,899 --> 01:43:10,010
Grab right from using the grip.

907
01:43:10,010 --> 01:43:14,250
Press the lower button to release the magazine.

908
01:43:14,250 --> 01:43:20,020
Now it's a completely blank screen if I launch it from Oculus.

909
01:43:20,020 --> 01:43:25,779
Grab your head and press rip.

910
01:43:25,779 --> 01:43:31,560
Press menu to open the scoreboard.

911
01:43:31,560 --> 01:43:39,060
I'm getting some resistance here.

912
01:43:39,060 --> 01:43:46,489
That's better.

913
01:43:46,489 --> 01:43:53,720
Don't jump out the window.

914
01:43:53,720 --> 01:44:03,909
Press menu plus trigger to open the game menu.

915
01:44:03,909 --> 01:44:10,329
Play offline, play online settings.

916
01:44:10,329 --> 01:44:25,689
Every single game makes you do that, doesn't it?

917
01:44:25,689 --> 01:44:38,390
It actually feels pretty good.

918
01:44:38,390 --> 01:44:47,029
Where's the clip?

919
01:44:47,029 --> 01:45:02,250
That's how you throw.

920
01:45:02,250 --> 01:45:06,420
Grab, activate, and then let go.

921
01:45:06,420 --> 01:45:14,229
The controls are actually really good.

922
01:45:14,229 --> 01:45:22,949
Let me try this thing.

923
01:45:22,949 --> 01:45:41,300
What's going on here?

924
01:45:41,300 --> 01:45:45,300
Are you going to cock it?

925
01:45:45,300 --> 01:45:49,300
My chat said your game is loud and also we might have to play in the beta branch.

926
01:45:49,300 --> 01:45:54,819
We both have to be in the beta.

927
01:45:54,819 --> 01:45:59,560
Do we have to download the game again?

928
01:45:59,560 --> 01:46:04,949
If you just right click properties, switch to beta, it's a short download.

929
01:46:04,949 --> 01:46:08,949
Can you confirm that that works first?

930
01:46:08,949 --> 01:46:13,189
Then I can launch an Oculus VR mode so it should work.

931
01:46:13,189 --> 01:46:55,819
Bunch of beta boys.

932
01:46:55,819 --> 01:47:04,090
Did it work?

933
01:47:04,090 --> 01:47:16,380
Is it confirmed?

934
01:47:16,380 --> 01:47:22,460
The problem is solved.

935
01:47:22,460 --> 01:47:44,199
How does this one work?

936
01:47:44,199 --> 01:47:57,510
Are you good?

937
01:47:57,510 --> 01:48:01,510
I'm in the game and it works.

938
01:48:01,510 --> 01:48:11,560
That was a nightmare.

939
01:48:11,560 --> 01:48:16,060
I think I'm going to throw my Oculus in the trash after the stream.

940
01:48:16,060 --> 01:48:23,449
Why not on stream?

941
01:48:23,449 --> 01:48:32,600
Let's close this.

942
01:48:32,600 --> 01:48:38,699
Go get the beta client.

943
01:48:38,699 --> 01:48:43,000
Do I have any betas?

944
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:49,399
I don't see any.

945
01:48:49,399 --> 01:48:53,399
Beta dash.

946
01:48:53,399 --> 01:48:57,960
I'm getting it.

947
01:48:57,960 --> 01:49:10,119
Update queued.

948
01:49:10,119 --> 01:49:14,119
Game will launch in approximately three hours.

949
01:49:14,119 --> 01:49:20,199
No way.

950
01:49:20,199 --> 01:49:31,779
Is there a reason why?

951
01:49:31,779 --> 01:49:37,239
There it goes.

952
01:49:37,239 --> 01:49:42,180
The beta client.

953
01:49:42,180 --> 01:49:47,060
I totally am too tall because I can't reach the floor.

954
01:49:47,060 --> 01:49:53,029
This shit is taking a long time.

955
01:49:53,029 --> 01:49:59,449
Why is everything always about you?

956
01:49:59,449 --> 01:50:04,899
You're almost at strike three.

957
01:50:04,899 --> 01:50:08,899
We had technical problems when we started and now you have technical problems again?

958
01:50:08,899 --> 01:50:13,659
That's strike two.

959
01:50:13,659 --> 01:50:17,829
Strike three means you know what it means, right?

960
01:50:17,829 --> 01:50:29,720
That's what it means.

961
01:50:29,720 --> 01:50:33,720
Give a tour of your VR house.

962
01:50:33,720 --> 01:50:37,720
This is what it looks like outside.

963
01:50:37,720 --> 01:50:41,720
You hold your hand up.

964
01:50:41,720 --> 01:50:46,020
A butterfly will land on you.

965
01:50:46,020 --> 01:50:50,020
An Oculus.

966
01:50:50,020 --> 01:50:56,359
Mark Zuckerberg.

967
01:50:56,359 --> 01:51:00,600
I hit my mic.

968
01:51:00,600 --> 01:51:15,640
Where are the butterflies?

969
01:51:15,640 --> 01:51:25,029
What am I at?

970
01:51:25,029 --> 01:51:29,029
25%.

971
01:51:29,029 --> 01:51:33,029
I have gamer neck.

972
01:51:33,029 --> 01:51:38,229
Just open my screen and take a screenshot.

973
01:51:38,229 --> 01:51:47,130
It just puts extra weight down here.

974
01:51:47,130 --> 01:51:54,819
Just go. I wanted to go but I have to download this beta client.

975
01:51:54,819 --> 01:51:58,819
It was downloading so slow.

976
01:51:58,819 --> 01:52:03,130
Blaine Star.

977
01:52:03,130 --> 01:52:07,130
We were ready to go.

978
01:52:07,130 --> 01:52:12,329
I was like alright fine.

979
01:52:12,329 --> 01:52:16,329
What do we do?

980
01:52:16,329 --> 01:52:30,460
I hurt my hand.

981
01:52:30,460 --> 01:52:41,210
I just hurt myself.

982
01:52:41,210 --> 01:52:46,409
For this you have to go on cam and do the Fortnite dance.

983
01:52:46,409 --> 01:52:57,289
What's the one that goes like this?

984
01:52:57,289 --> 01:53:01,289
I don't know what you're talking about.

985
01:53:01,289 --> 01:53:05,720
I'm just burning conversation fire right now.

986
01:53:05,720 --> 01:53:24,409
What if I can't open the beta?

987
01:53:24,409 --> 01:53:30,949
It's almost done.

988
01:53:30,949 --> 01:53:49,500
You can't climb a tree.

989
01:53:49,500 --> 01:53:54,630
Hold on a second.

990
01:53:54,630 --> 01:53:58,630
Is there any reason why OpenVR wouldn't be capturing this?

991
01:53:58,630 --> 01:54:07,460
I feel like every time I talk to you you're not there.

992
01:54:07,460 --> 01:54:12,340
Is there any reason OpenVR wouldn't be capturing this?

993
01:54:12,340 --> 01:54:20,279
I can't think of a reason.

994
01:54:20,279 --> 01:54:33,590
OpenVR pulls whatever is in your headset.

995
01:54:33,590 --> 01:54:37,590
Strike 3.

996
01:54:37,590 --> 01:54:45,079
Now you can open the game but you can't capture it.

997
01:54:45,079 --> 01:54:57,689
It's because I'm on an Oculus

998
01:54:57,689 --> 01:55:01,689
and OpenVR is for Steam games.

999
01:55:01,689 --> 01:55:06,300
Which is why if you have an Oculus

1000
01:55:06,300 --> 01:55:12,329
it should go in the trash.

1001
01:55:12,329 --> 01:55:16,329
It's quite the expensive technology.

1002
01:55:16,329 --> 01:55:22,170
All I have is desktop capture.

1003
01:55:22,170 --> 01:55:26,170
Is there a way I can change the field of view of my desktop capture

1004
01:55:26,170 --> 01:55:57,420
so it's not 6?

1005
01:55:57,420 --> 01:56:01,590
I'm about to launch the game.

1006
01:56:01,590 --> 01:56:11,979
This has been a pretty good break.

1007
01:56:11,979 --> 01:56:15,979
Enjoy the chat.

1008
01:56:15,979 --> 01:56:20,470
Just hanging out.

1009
01:56:20,470 --> 01:56:27,529
Enjoying my beverage.

1010
01:56:27,529 --> 01:56:34,619
Why did that person tell me to fuck off?

1011
01:56:34,619 --> 01:56:41,720
I'm opening the beta somehow.

1012
01:56:41,720 --> 01:56:46,020
I'm going to chill

1013
01:56:46,020 --> 01:56:51,460
playing with grenades.

1014
01:56:51,460 --> 01:56:57,989
I'm going to try a few things.

1015
01:56:57,989 --> 01:57:03,579
Is it opening?

1016
01:57:03,579 --> 01:57:18,340
I guess I'm in.

1017
01:57:18,340 --> 01:57:26,039
This looks ready to go.

1018
01:57:26,039 --> 01:57:33,350
I think I did it.

1019
01:57:33,350 --> 01:57:38,739
Did you figure it out?

1020
01:57:38,739 --> 01:57:42,739
I'm heading back in.

1021
01:57:42,739 --> 01:57:48,649
That was so loud I almost thought it was going to drive into my house.

1022
01:57:48,649 --> 01:57:52,819
This person is brazen.

1023
01:57:52,819 --> 01:57:58,090
They're starting to get even more ridiculous with this.

1024
01:57:58,090 --> 01:58:05,779
One of these days that car is coming through the wall.

1025
01:58:05,779 --> 01:58:13,979
I can't wait for that guy to be in the next Jerma Rumble.

1026
01:58:13,979 --> 01:58:24,539
Fucking vroom vroom is what that guy's name is going to be.

1027
01:58:24,539 --> 01:58:32,789
Why does this do this to me?

1028
01:58:32,789 --> 01:58:46,739
Easy. God.

1029
01:58:46,739 --> 01:58:54,869
Thank you for your patience.

1030
01:58:54,869 --> 01:59:02,300
Your patience is appreciated.

1031
01:59:02,300 --> 01:59:13,180
Therefore, you know the rest.

1032
01:59:13,180 --> 01:59:34,979
What does this do?

1033
01:59:34,979 --> 01:59:41,770
Pistols.

1034
01:59:41,770 --> 01:59:45,770
This is cool.

1035
01:59:45,770 --> 01:59:51,260
It's a little magnum.

1036
01:59:51,260 --> 01:59:58,359
Where did this come from?

1037
01:59:58,359 --> 02:00:13,590
Did I buy a pistol? How do I send this back?

1038
02:00:13,590 --> 02:00:17,590
Ten hours later, I apologize. This is all my fault.

1039
02:00:17,590 --> 02:00:21,590
I'm an embarrassment to you and your family. Thanks for having me over for Thanksgiving.

1040
02:00:21,590 --> 02:00:25,590
I invite you to my wedding and all that. I know now why you didn't come.

1041
02:00:25,590 --> 02:00:30,329
I'm ready to play.

1042
02:00:30,329 --> 02:00:34,329
It's giving me a random question.

1043
02:00:34,329 --> 02:00:38,329
I'm ready to play.

1044
02:00:38,329 --> 02:00:46,920
How do I get out of this? How do we play together?

1045
02:00:46,920 --> 02:00:58,380
There's a menu.

1046
02:00:58,380 --> 02:01:03,579
Play online?

1047
02:01:03,579 --> 02:01:07,880
I don't know.

1048
02:01:07,880 --> 02:01:12,310
North America, Europe.

1049
02:01:12,310 --> 02:01:17,380
Make a game or something.

1050
02:01:17,380 --> 02:01:21,380
If you hold down the menu button and then hold trigger,

1051
02:01:21,380 --> 02:01:25,560
you're going to get a menu. You're going to do play online.

1052
02:01:25,560 --> 02:01:29,560
I think these are just games that are going on right now.

1053
02:01:29,560 --> 02:01:33,560
This is just like a multiplayer shooter.

1054
02:01:33,560 --> 02:01:37,560
I'm going to make one.

1055
02:01:37,560 --> 02:01:41,560
Anybody watching right now that wants to play?

1056
02:01:41,560 --> 02:01:45,560
Don't stream tonight.

1057
02:01:45,560 --> 02:01:49,560
You have a headset on.

1058
02:01:49,560 --> 02:01:53,930
That's the future.

1059
02:01:53,930 --> 02:02:02,890
Why is that a bad idea?

1060
02:02:02,890 --> 02:02:07,510
We'll do it right now.

1061
02:02:07,510 --> 02:02:12,699
Check it out.

1062
02:02:12,699 --> 02:02:16,939
Input.

1063
02:02:16,939 --> 02:02:21,500
Hold on.

1064
02:02:21,500 --> 02:02:28,939
Sound.

1065
02:02:28,939 --> 02:02:34,250
What is that? Sound.

1066
02:02:34,250 --> 02:02:38,979
Is there no sound?

1067
02:02:38,979 --> 02:02:46,100
There is no sound option.

1068
02:02:46,100 --> 02:02:53,989
There is no audio setting.

1069
02:02:53,989 --> 02:02:59,449
We're going to get stream sniped.

1070
02:02:59,449 --> 02:03:03,449
There's friendly fire. You can turn bots on.

1071
02:03:03,449 --> 02:03:07,449
I see your lobby right there.

1072
02:03:07,449 --> 02:03:11,449
Whisper me the password.

1073
02:03:11,449 --> 02:03:15,449
This is friends only.

1074
02:03:15,449 --> 02:03:20,649
What's your phone number?

1075
02:03:20,649 --> 02:03:26,279
It was 741.

1076
02:03:26,279 --> 02:03:30,279
Can I mute me?

1077
02:03:30,279 --> 02:03:34,279
How do I mute you?

1078
02:03:34,279 --> 02:03:39,659
You can mute people.

1079
02:03:39,659 --> 02:03:44,340
That's not a problem.

1080
02:03:44,340 --> 02:03:48,340
It's this biz kid.

1081
02:03:48,340 --> 02:03:54,819
Quick.

1082
02:03:54,819 --> 02:04:00,409
There was a kick button here a second ago.

1083
02:04:00,409 --> 02:04:04,409
Get him out of here.

1084
02:04:04,409 --> 02:04:09,739
I don't care.

1085
02:04:09,739 --> 02:04:16,020
We're going to get five copy pastas for the people that come in here.

1086
02:04:16,020 --> 02:04:21,539
There's a mute mic button on the left.

1087
02:04:21,539 --> 02:04:25,539
When somebody comes in, just hit mute mic on them.

1088
02:04:25,539 --> 02:04:31,899
I swear I saw a kick thing.

1089
02:04:31,899 --> 02:04:36,260
How many people are watching your stream right now?

1090
02:04:36,260 --> 02:04:40,569
6,000.

1091
02:04:40,569 --> 02:04:44,569
5,000 here. How many do you have there?

1092
02:04:44,569 --> 02:04:48,569
There's like 6,000 people watching this together.

1093
02:04:48,569 --> 02:05:00,920
Only Tanner from high school has this game?

1094
02:05:00,920 --> 02:05:05,670
Collectively we have 6,000 people.

1095
02:05:05,670 --> 02:05:11,260
I'm Tanner.

1096
02:05:11,260 --> 02:05:15,260
I'm not. I'm shooting the bots.

1097
02:05:15,260 --> 02:05:20,069
Why am I dead?

1098
02:05:20,069 --> 02:05:28,069
They just walk over.

1099
02:05:28,069 --> 02:05:41,050
How do you reload a gun?

1100
02:05:41,050 --> 02:05:45,220
Do I have any more?

1101
02:05:45,220 --> 02:05:49,220
I need more bullets.

1102
02:05:49,220 --> 02:05:53,220
You have bullets in your sack on your left.

1103
02:05:53,220 --> 02:06:03,899
Look in your sack.

1104
02:06:03,899 --> 02:06:13,430
I can't bend that low.

1105
02:06:13,430 --> 02:06:18,869
Do you have infinite ammo?

1106
02:06:18,869 --> 02:06:23,939
I don't know.

1107
02:06:23,939 --> 02:06:33,050
Are we playing the gun game?

1108
02:06:33,050 --> 02:06:39,960
I'm just playing. Stop with the questions.

1109
02:06:39,960 --> 02:06:48,659
I'm here with bot Kurt.

1110
02:06:48,659 --> 02:07:01,449
They're letting me do this.

1111
02:07:01,449 --> 02:07:07,609
They shouldn't be letting us do this.

1112
02:07:07,609 --> 02:07:15,029
Why are you shooting people in the head?

1113
02:07:15,029 --> 02:07:21,899
Why?

1114
02:07:21,899 --> 02:07:25,899
You're that big. I knew it.

1115
02:07:25,899 --> 02:07:29,899
I knew you were the huge guy.

1116
02:07:29,899 --> 02:07:39,260
I should have known.

1117
02:07:39,260 --> 02:07:46,119
You're bigger than Earthquake.

1118
02:07:46,119 --> 02:07:51,510
He's out of ammo.

1119
02:07:51,510 --> 02:08:00,970
What?

1120
02:08:00,970 --> 02:08:06,939
The different trigger for grabbing the front of your gun is really screwing me up.

1121
02:08:06,939 --> 02:08:13,529
This is nauseating.

1122
02:08:13,529 --> 02:08:25,239
Wait a minute. What the fuck? Are you kidding me?

1123
02:08:25,239 --> 02:08:31,210
This actually is just VR counter strike, isn't it?

1124
02:08:31,210 --> 02:08:40,300
You just bend over and pick up guns because I totally can't.

1125
02:08:40,300 --> 02:08:49,579
I don't know.

1126
02:08:49,579 --> 02:08:53,579
We can play with the actual people.

1127
02:08:53,579 --> 02:09:03,930
Anyone joining?

1128
02:09:03,930 --> 02:09:25,060
Damn it.

1129
02:09:25,060 --> 02:09:39,140
What was this?

1130
02:09:39,140 --> 02:09:48,630
Now I didn't get him.

1131
02:09:48,630 --> 02:09:53,699
Why did I just hear you?

1132
02:09:53,699 --> 02:09:58,699
You're gonna die.

1133
02:09:58,699 --> 02:10:12,859
That's the bot Dave.

1134
02:10:12,859 --> 02:10:19,060
Is that what it is?

1135
02:10:19,060 --> 02:10:28,220
They're footsteps everywhere.

1136
02:10:28,220 --> 02:10:32,579
Why can't I hear him?

1137
02:10:32,579 --> 02:10:37,189
No.

1138
02:10:37,189 --> 02:10:41,189
The bot Dave spawns behind people?

1139
02:10:41,189 --> 02:10:51,180
As long as you don't break TOS, we're fine.

1140
02:10:51,180 --> 02:11:01,739
You're a reasonable person.

1141
02:11:01,739 --> 02:11:07,449
I feel like I've seen you one time.

1142
02:11:07,449 --> 02:11:15,880
I just thought you were reasonable. Let's not push in here.

1143
02:11:15,880 --> 02:11:27,590
This feels good.

1144
02:11:27,590 --> 02:11:31,590
Fucking bot Dave!

1145
02:11:31,590 --> 02:11:49,369
Throw it right over his head.

1146
02:11:49,369 --> 02:11:55,909
This is not what I thought it was.

1147
02:11:55,909 --> 02:12:02,949
What do you have?

1148
02:12:02,949 --> 02:12:12,039
This is cool.

1149
02:12:12,039 --> 02:12:21,340
I want to keep this.

1150
02:12:21,340 --> 02:12:35,460
No!

1151
02:12:35,460 --> 02:12:45,529
This is alright.

1152
02:12:45,529 --> 02:12:49,529
He's bottom bragging.

1153
02:12:49,529 --> 02:12:53,529
Let's do a gun game.

1154
02:12:53,529 --> 02:13:00,439
Experience all the guns on data center.

1155
02:13:00,439 --> 02:13:04,439
Turn off friends only they say.

1156
02:13:04,439 --> 02:13:10,090
I assume they can join even if we're playing.

1157
02:13:10,090 --> 02:13:16,100
Unless this is 2003.

1158
02:13:16,100 --> 02:13:22,710
Why is everybody doing Bunker S?

1159
02:13:22,710 --> 02:13:26,710
What's the nuclear option?

1160
02:13:26,710 --> 02:13:38,020
I actually have no idea.

1161
02:13:38,020 --> 02:13:42,520
Can you open the menu the way you did before?

1162
02:13:42,520 --> 02:13:46,520
No talking anyone.

1163
02:13:46,520 --> 02:13:54,310
Do you have any idea?

1164
02:13:54,310 --> 02:14:07,939
We're inviting a vampire into our house apparently.

1165
02:14:07,939 --> 02:14:16,470
Go to menu.

1166
02:14:16,470 --> 02:14:23,079
Save by spring.

1167
02:14:23,079 --> 02:14:27,079
Save our spring.

1168
02:14:27,079 --> 02:14:31,079
You already did that.

1169
02:14:31,079 --> 02:14:54,119
He's behind me.

1170
02:14:54,119 --> 02:15:08,939
Drop it.

1171
02:15:08,939 --> 02:15:13,750
I can't even see your game anymore.

1172
02:15:13,750 --> 02:15:20,359
Why are they always behind you Jerma?

1173
02:15:20,359 --> 02:15:24,359
I press the lead button.

1174
02:15:24,359 --> 02:15:29,159
I don't want to know what that is.

1175
02:15:29,159 --> 02:15:33,399
Is your game still named Star?

1176
02:15:33,399 --> 02:15:38,460
I see data center.

1177
02:15:38,460 --> 02:15:44,100
Can I see who's in this game?

1178
02:15:44,100 --> 02:15:50,250
It's probably full.

1179
02:15:50,250 --> 02:15:54,250
I accidentally did it.

1180
02:15:54,250 --> 02:15:58,250
I thought it was back.

1181
02:15:58,250 --> 02:16:03,060
Don't do that.

1182
02:16:03,060 --> 02:16:07,619
You do have to do that because now you have to make a new game.

1183
02:16:07,619 --> 02:16:11,619
I'm in the lobby right now because I did the thing that you almost did.

1184
02:16:11,619 --> 02:16:16,439
Kick somebody and invite.

1185
02:16:16,439 --> 02:16:21,829
Just kick somebody.

1186
02:16:21,829 --> 02:16:25,829
That doesn't feel good. It feels better when the streamer is an idiot and has to make the new game.

1187
02:16:25,829 --> 02:16:30,069
Play online. Creating lobby.

1188
02:16:30,069 --> 02:16:34,069
Friend only so you can join.

1189
02:16:34,069 --> 02:16:39,459
I'm setting a pin so it's only stream friend.

1190
02:16:39,459 --> 02:16:43,639
I'm in your game.

1191
02:16:43,639 --> 02:16:48,579
I don't see you.

1192
02:16:48,579 --> 02:16:52,819
Your name is not Star?

1193
02:16:52,819 --> 02:16:59,049
This is definitely the lobby.

1194
02:16:59,049 --> 02:17:06,100
That was a wrong game.

1195
02:17:06,100 --> 02:17:13,000
What's password?

1196
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:17,000
Friend only.

1197
02:17:17,000 --> 02:17:21,000
Don't open the menu and click leave.

1198
02:17:21,000 --> 02:17:25,000
It's actually leave game.

1199
02:17:25,000 --> 02:17:33,639
How do you arrest somebody?

1200
02:17:33,639 --> 02:17:40,180
Final gun and gun game is handcuffs.

1201
02:17:40,180 --> 02:17:48,969
There we go.

1202
02:17:48,969 --> 02:17:53,719
I'm ready to win.

1203
02:17:53,719 --> 02:18:01,670
I'm fucking ready.

1204
02:18:01,670 --> 02:18:06,170
This is loaded?

1205
02:18:06,170 --> 02:18:18,629
You're like gun gaming.

1206
02:18:18,629 --> 02:18:23,260
It's like back and it's leave.

1207
02:18:23,260 --> 02:18:31,340
I didn't mute it.

1208
02:18:31,340 --> 02:18:39,079
Is this a countdown preparing us?

1209
02:18:39,079 --> 02:18:45,290
I don't see a countdown.

1210
02:18:45,290 --> 02:18:49,659
I muted Josh.

1211
02:18:49,659 --> 02:18:56,309
This is fucking awesome.

1212
02:18:56,309 --> 02:19:03,159
What is this like?

1213
02:19:03,159 --> 02:19:09,319
I'm muted every time.

1214
02:19:09,319 --> 02:19:15,420
Everybody is muted and I'm still hearing people talk.

1215
02:19:15,420 --> 02:19:40,489
That's the kill feed.

1216
02:19:40,489 --> 02:19:44,489
Oh fuck.

1217
02:19:44,489 --> 02:19:49,690
I should always be turning around.

1218
02:19:49,690 --> 02:20:06,229
I can still take this.

1219
02:20:06,229 --> 02:20:14,940
That guy's fucking hat off.

1220
02:20:14,940 --> 02:20:36,299
I got it too.

1221
02:20:36,299 --> 02:20:40,299
I hate the controls in this.

1222
02:20:40,299 --> 02:20:44,729
It's just different to grab than the other gun games we've played.

1223
02:20:44,729 --> 02:20:48,899
You don't keep trying to grab the full of your gun and pulling out your magazine.

1224
02:20:48,899 --> 02:20:52,899
You have to do it on some guns.

1225
02:20:52,899 --> 02:20:57,399
You don't understand.

1226
02:20:57,399 --> 02:21:04,250
Oh shit.

1227
02:21:04,250 --> 02:21:08,250
You don't like this? I think this is a blast.

1228
02:21:08,250 --> 02:21:13,579
This is awesome. It's hard to get used to

1229
02:21:13,579 --> 02:21:19,350
being the opposite of how it is.

1230
02:21:19,350 --> 02:21:23,350
Nice spawning behind me.

1231
02:21:23,350 --> 02:21:27,350
Nice. Nice job.

1232
02:21:27,350 --> 02:21:43,370
I got no scoped.

1233
02:21:43,370 --> 02:21:56,739
Really?

1234
02:21:56,739 --> 02:22:06,579
Nice. Good shot.

1235
02:22:06,579 --> 02:22:14,649
I hate these snipers. This is so awesome.

1236
02:22:14,649 --> 02:22:23,290
I just got turned on.

1237
02:22:23,290 --> 02:22:27,290
Oh my god. Are you kidding? That didn't kill him.

1238
02:22:27,290 --> 02:22:31,290
What the hell did you just do?

1239
02:22:31,290 --> 02:22:37,000
I'm trying to pull the little handle out.

1240
02:22:37,000 --> 02:22:41,479
There we go. It does it automatically.

1241
02:22:41,479 --> 02:22:45,909
No it doesn't.

1242
02:22:45,909 --> 02:23:00,040
On what?

1243
02:23:00,040 --> 02:23:14,420
Oh my god. I hate you.

1244
02:23:14,420 --> 02:23:33,690
Fuck you Tommy.

1245
02:23:33,690 --> 02:23:41,260
Fuck you Mike.

1246
02:23:41,260 --> 02:23:52,340
I hope you guys saw that. That was fucking cool.

1247
02:23:52,340 --> 02:23:59,579
I don't know how this gun works.

1248
02:23:59,579 --> 02:24:07,700
Shit where? Over here?

1249
02:24:07,700 --> 02:24:12,069
Reaction time.

1250
02:24:12,069 --> 02:24:16,069
Somebody put the handcuffs on?

1251
02:24:16,069 --> 02:24:20,500
Did you use bolt with two hands?

1252
02:24:20,500 --> 02:24:25,510
Let's do it again.

1253
02:24:25,510 --> 02:24:29,510
I'm bolting with the wrong hand.

1254
02:24:29,510 --> 02:24:33,819
I was doing it too.

1255
02:24:33,819 --> 02:24:48,680
Learn to use the iron sight.

1256
02:24:48,680 --> 02:24:57,180
Forget that.

1257
02:24:57,180 --> 02:25:03,020
What? What?

1258
02:25:03,020 --> 02:25:07,510
We're people in this game?

1259
02:25:07,510 --> 02:25:21,530
I don't believe you.

1260
02:25:21,530 --> 02:25:36,120
We're all around looking for people.

1261
02:25:36,120 --> 02:25:55,639
I did not.

1262
02:25:55,639 --> 02:26:04,680
Get your right in the head.

1263
02:26:04,680 --> 02:26:14,010
That was a waste.

1264
02:26:14,010 --> 02:26:19,850
I expected to not find anyone for 15 minutes again.

1265
02:26:19,850 --> 02:26:36,020
That's what I have to say to that.

1266
02:26:36,020 --> 02:26:48,780
He's holding it upside down.

1267
02:26:48,780 --> 02:27:01,270
Geez Louise this is a bad one.

1268
02:27:01,270 --> 02:27:08,569
Turn around.

1269
02:27:08,569 --> 02:27:13,430
I'm walking in circles.

1270
02:27:13,430 --> 02:27:17,430
Anyone knows if there's moving and accuracy?

1271
02:27:17,430 --> 02:27:24,579
That's a good question.

1272
02:27:24,579 --> 02:27:29,719
Come on.

1273
02:27:29,719 --> 02:27:46,549
I've been stuck on this saying two guns.

1274
02:27:46,549 --> 02:27:51,559
Wrong button.

1275
02:27:51,559 --> 02:27:55,559
Don't grab the mag with that gun.

1276
02:27:55,559 --> 02:28:11,750
I have to turn like that.

1277
02:28:11,750 --> 02:28:18,020
360.

1278
02:28:18,020 --> 02:28:31,659
What was that?

1279
02:28:31,659 --> 02:28:38,889
What?

1280
02:28:38,889 --> 02:28:42,889
I'm confused.

1281
02:28:42,889 --> 02:28:46,889
Why did I not see you?

1282
02:28:46,889 --> 02:28:51,829
That's my mic.

1283
02:28:51,829 --> 02:29:17,290
I'm trying so hard.

1284
02:29:17,290 --> 02:29:23,829
I didn't get that kill.

1285
02:29:23,829 --> 02:29:33,370
Damn.

1286
02:29:33,370 --> 02:29:49,500
I didn't grab it.

1287
02:29:49,500 --> 02:29:58,649
I'm so confused on that.

1288
02:29:58,649 --> 02:30:02,649
How do I have zero kills?

1289
02:30:02,649 --> 02:30:11,420
This is fucking hard.

1290
02:30:11,420 --> 02:30:21,639
Again.

1291
02:30:21,639 --> 02:30:25,639
I have to solve the mystery of taking your hand off the trigger.

1292
02:30:25,639 --> 02:30:29,639
After you take your hand off the trigger once

1293
02:30:29,639 --> 02:30:33,819
then you have to hold forever.

1294
02:30:33,819 --> 02:31:03,620
I'm going mad.

1295
02:31:03,620 --> 02:31:07,620
My headphone fell out.

1296
02:31:07,620 --> 02:31:11,620
Can I glue this into my brain?

1297
02:31:11,620 --> 02:31:24,299
My ears are getting too sweaty.

1298
02:31:24,299 --> 02:31:40,360
I wish I could see how much health they had left.

1299
02:31:40,360 --> 02:31:47,459
I got him.

1300
02:31:47,459 --> 02:31:54,569
Shoot me please.

1301
02:31:54,569 --> 02:32:00,629
What the fuck?

1302
02:32:00,629 --> 02:32:04,629
What the fuck?

1303
02:32:04,629 --> 02:32:23,000
Oh my god.

1304
02:32:23,000 --> 02:32:37,340
I'm having problems here.

1305
02:32:37,340 --> 02:32:57,670
You spawned right...

1306
02:32:57,670 --> 02:33:15,879
I got you.

1307
02:33:15,879 --> 02:33:23,559
Where did you know

1308
02:33:23,559 --> 02:33:27,559
that I was there from?

1309
02:33:27,559 --> 02:33:50,920
It's the free upgrade.

1310
02:33:50,920 --> 02:33:56,489
Oh fuck no.

1311
02:33:56,489 --> 02:34:15,579
Poor spy crap.

1312
02:34:15,579 --> 02:34:34,440
Understand how I didn't die.

1313
02:34:34,440 --> 02:34:42,120
Did a lot of

1314
02:34:42,120 --> 02:34:47,510
little bits of damage apparently.

1315
02:34:47,510 --> 02:34:54,700
Come here.

1316
02:34:54,700 --> 02:34:58,700
Yes.

1317
02:34:58,700 --> 02:35:07,209
Good job.

1318
02:35:07,209 --> 02:35:14,889
What happened there?

1319
02:35:14,889 --> 02:35:24,790
I'm trying to use the iron sight.

1320
02:35:24,790 --> 02:35:33,579
I wonder what that looks like to people watching.

1321
02:35:33,579 --> 02:35:56,090
Use the front?

1322
02:35:56,090 --> 02:36:00,090
I am using the front and rear sights.

1323
02:36:00,090 --> 02:36:04,090
The way that OpenVR works is it only captures

1324
02:36:04,090 --> 02:36:08,090
one eye. So depending on where I'm holding it probably doesn't look like

1325
02:36:08,090 --> 02:36:17,940
I'm doing it but I am.

1326
02:36:17,940 --> 02:36:21,940
Search and destroy?

1327
02:36:21,940 --> 02:36:25,940
What is this one?

1328
02:36:25,940 --> 02:36:36,250
My arms are covered in water.

1329
02:36:36,250 --> 02:36:41,579
Unless your other eye is on your chin.

1330
02:36:41,579 --> 02:36:51,180
It's hard.

1331
02:36:51,180 --> 02:36:55,180
It's a thing you never did before.

1332
02:36:55,180 --> 02:37:09,899
It's a really

1333
02:37:09,899 --> 02:37:16,229
not loaded map.

1334
02:37:16,229 --> 02:37:20,229
He's played this game before.

1335
02:37:20,229 --> 02:37:29,909
No.

1336
02:37:29,909 --> 02:37:48,540
I don't know about this one.

1337
02:37:48,540 --> 02:37:53,340
What is that?

1338
02:37:53,340 --> 02:38:10,860
Up top.

1339
02:38:10,860 --> 02:38:18,420
Excellent work.

1340
02:38:18,420 --> 02:38:40,979
Did I get him?

1341
02:38:40,979 --> 02:38:48,090
Did I get him?

1342
02:38:48,090 --> 02:38:54,680
What happened?

1343
02:38:54,680 --> 02:39:03,049
I don't know how it works.

1344
02:39:03,049 --> 02:39:19,219
Please sitting down.

1345
02:39:19,219 --> 02:39:23,659
Good.

1346
02:39:23,659 --> 02:39:35,379
Make sure nobody hits me.

1347
02:39:35,379 --> 02:39:41,540
It's so hard to do that.

1348
02:39:41,540 --> 02:39:54,360
I'm going to sneak up and just shotgun blast.

1349
02:39:54,360 --> 02:40:05,739
How do I go faster?

1350
02:40:05,739 --> 02:40:14,950
I thought I was going to shoot anybody with this thing.

1351
02:40:14,950 --> 02:40:27,559
I have no idea how you're supposed to hold a sniper

1352
02:40:27,559 --> 02:40:31,559
straight when it has no weight.

1353
02:40:31,559 --> 02:40:35,559
Looking through the scope.

1354
02:40:35,559 --> 02:40:40,250
There's no way.

1355
02:40:40,250 --> 02:40:44,250
Don't people have VR gun things?

1356
02:40:44,250 --> 02:40:48,549
I think you can get one.

1357
02:40:48,549 --> 02:40:52,920
I got a sniper rifle again.

1358
02:41:40,260 --> 02:41:45,780
Now I can shoot it.

1359
02:41:45,780 --> 02:41:57,180
I didn't hit him in the head.

1360
02:41:57,180 --> 02:42:12,329
What?

1361
02:42:12,329 --> 02:42:22,260
Put it down.

1362
02:42:22,260 --> 02:42:49,270
It's an HTC Vive gun.

1363
02:42:49,270 --> 02:42:53,270
That's so cool.

1364
02:42:53,270 --> 02:43:22,459
He's just waving at me.

1365
02:43:22,459 --> 02:43:27,829
This is like a demon.

1366
02:43:27,829 --> 02:43:31,829
It looks very uncomfortable.

1367
02:43:31,829 --> 02:43:37,639
I'm sitting down.

1368
02:43:37,639 --> 02:43:48,090
I got him.

1369
02:43:48,090 --> 02:43:54,489
The intensity is here.

1370
02:43:54,489 --> 02:43:58,489
I got this sniper rifle again.

1371
02:43:58,489 --> 02:44:22,250
Hey, just want to show you where I am.

1372
02:44:22,250 --> 02:44:42,870
That was horrible.

1373
02:44:42,870 --> 02:44:46,870
I fucking murdered you.

1374
02:44:46,870 --> 02:44:50,870
Jesus Christ, you need to buy guns?

1375
02:44:50,870 --> 02:45:04,569
That was fun though.

1376
02:45:04,569 --> 02:45:09,379
No one's spotting behind me.

1377
02:45:09,379 --> 02:45:13,750
Buy a gun.

1378
02:45:13,750 --> 02:45:17,989
How do you buy a gun?

1379
02:45:17,989 --> 02:45:23,000
Get ready.

1380
02:45:23,000 --> 02:45:27,000
Left controller on the trackpad.

1381
02:45:27,000 --> 02:45:36,020
You can buy stuff.

1382
02:45:36,020 --> 02:45:41,530
Trackpad?

1383
02:45:41,530 --> 02:45:45,700
Are we bad guys or good guys?

1384
02:45:45,700 --> 02:46:03,819
We're the good guys no matter what.

1385
02:46:03,819 --> 02:46:09,079
I'm ready with my little baby gun.

1386
02:46:09,079 --> 02:46:13,079
Is that a bad guy? Who's on my team?

1387
02:46:13,079 --> 02:46:17,639
I took one second to see where I was.

1388
02:46:17,639 --> 02:46:36,629
Is there a bomb in here?

1389
02:46:36,629 --> 02:46:47,639
I'm dead.

1390
02:46:47,639 --> 02:46:54,569
Where is this bomb?

1391
02:47:00,069 --> 02:47:04,819
Have I played Counter-Strike before?

1392
02:47:04,819 --> 02:47:08,819
Maybe three or four times in my life.

1393
02:47:08,819 --> 02:47:15,290
We are defusing bombs.

1394
02:47:15,290 --> 02:47:23,350
Let's go.

1395
02:47:23,350 --> 02:47:34,809
Put your hands down and move faster.

1396
02:47:34,809 --> 02:48:06,709
I'm here.

1397
02:48:06,709 --> 02:48:10,709
Just say behind.

1398
02:48:10,709 --> 02:48:14,709
Like a chef.

1399
02:48:14,709 --> 02:48:18,709
Not behind you.

1400
02:48:18,709 --> 02:48:24,170
You have a roast duck behind you.

1401
02:48:24,170 --> 02:48:28,170
I don't lie.

1402
02:48:28,170 --> 02:48:38,979
We scared them.

1403
02:48:43,610 --> 02:48:48,420
Are we supposed to be planting the bomb?

1404
02:48:48,420 --> 02:48:52,420
No.

1405
02:48:52,420 --> 02:49:10,020
Can I sell this?

1406
02:49:10,020 --> 02:49:37,459
I just need to make sure it works.

1407
02:49:37,459 --> 02:49:41,459
Covering fire.

1408
02:49:41,459 --> 02:49:46,899
Did I?

1409
02:49:46,899 --> 02:49:53,770
I threw his gun out.

1410
02:49:53,770 --> 02:49:57,770
I like this gun.

1411
02:49:57,770 --> 02:50:03,350
What's this?

1412
02:50:03,350 --> 02:50:30,459
Devolitions.

1413
02:50:30,459 --> 02:50:36,979
Stop.

1414
02:50:36,979 --> 02:50:51,750
I don't know.

1415
02:50:51,750 --> 02:50:56,760
Put it here.

1416
02:50:56,760 --> 02:51:11,540
There's a spot on the wall.

1417
02:51:11,540 --> 02:51:18,459
I don't have one of those.

1418
02:51:18,459 --> 02:51:27,479
You got this. Easy.

1419
02:51:27,479 --> 02:51:31,979
They're the ones planting the bomb.

1420
02:51:31,979 --> 02:51:35,979
I had bombs.

1421
02:51:35,979 --> 02:51:40,340
Grenades.

1422
02:51:40,340 --> 02:51:46,700
How do you throw the grenade?

1423
02:51:46,700 --> 02:51:50,700
If I did that over here, I'm going through the wall.

1424
02:51:50,700 --> 02:51:54,700
When you throw in this game, you throw really fast.

1425
02:51:54,700 --> 02:51:58,700
Do you have to hold grip and let go?

1426
02:51:58,700 --> 02:52:04,409
Or trigger and let go?

1427
02:52:04,409 --> 02:52:08,409
Let go.

1428
02:52:08,409 --> 02:52:18,440
Who wants this gun?

1429
02:52:18,440 --> 02:52:25,739
It makes me hold it easier.

1430
02:52:25,739 --> 02:52:33,989
It's like monsters.

1431
02:52:33,989 --> 02:52:39,899
I think I got an extra.

1432
02:52:39,899 --> 02:52:50,500
It's my time.

1433
02:52:50,500 --> 02:52:58,709
Let the rookie in.

1434
02:52:58,709 --> 02:53:02,709
Look at that line.

1435
02:53:02,709 --> 02:53:13,780
I'm going to make sure they don't come down that way.

1436
02:53:13,780 --> 02:53:18,979
This is really awesome.

1437
02:53:18,979 --> 02:53:39,430
Do I have to pump it?

1438
02:53:39,430 --> 02:54:04,260
I can't see.

1439
02:54:04,260 --> 02:54:14,299
That's it.

1440
02:54:14,299 --> 02:54:28,700
Time for the big gun to come out.

1441
02:54:28,700 --> 02:55:01,319
Where's the other one?

1442
02:55:01,319 --> 02:55:06,520
Can I haunt him?

1443
02:55:06,520 --> 02:55:18,229
This guy is always behind me.

1444
02:55:18,229 --> 02:55:29,879
Let's see how things are going.

1445
02:55:29,879 --> 02:55:33,879
Where are you?

1446
02:55:33,879 --> 02:55:41,319
I'm stream sniping. He's planting a bomb.

1447
02:55:41,319 --> 02:55:47,290
Get a good view.

1448
02:55:47,290 --> 02:55:59,719
I don't believe it. It's impossible.

1449
02:55:59,719 --> 02:56:11,450
That was like the term VR is in your name.

1450
02:56:11,450 --> 02:56:22,280
Is this going to blow up?

1451
02:56:22,280 --> 02:56:34,920
Is everyone sneezing?

1452
02:56:34,920 --> 02:56:38,920
I'm going to stay with everybody.

1453
02:56:38,920 --> 02:56:43,540
I'm getting spam weapons.

1454
02:56:43,540 --> 02:56:47,540
This is the ultimate spam weapon.

1455
02:56:47,540 --> 02:56:51,540
I'm going to hold the buttons down.

1456
02:56:51,540 --> 02:57:00,379
I'm so sorry.

1457
02:57:00,379 --> 02:57:04,870
I'm so sorry.

1458
02:57:04,870 --> 02:57:14,149
I'm really sorry.

1459
02:57:14,149 --> 02:57:18,149
Watch out.

1460
02:57:18,149 --> 02:57:30,620
I think I killed him.

1461
02:57:30,620 --> 02:57:34,620
This is really cool.

1462
02:57:34,620 --> 02:57:38,620
I'm trying to figure out how to jerk off the gun.

1463
02:57:38,620 --> 02:57:42,620
Did that button not do it?

1464
02:57:42,620 --> 02:57:46,620
I don't know what to do.

1465
02:57:46,620 --> 02:57:51,299
Two shotguns?

1466
02:57:51,299 --> 02:57:56,489
Knife only.

1467
02:57:56,489 --> 02:58:02,069
Let's tell them knife only and then let me shoot them with the shotgun.

1468
02:58:02,069 --> 02:58:13,399
Where are they?

1469
02:58:13,399 --> 02:58:18,920
On the right.

1470
02:58:18,920 --> 02:58:26,659
Covering fire there.

1471
02:58:26,659 --> 02:58:32,809
What is this? It was like a drone here.

1472
02:58:32,809 --> 02:58:37,370
I fucking hate this game.

1473
02:58:37,370 --> 02:59:14,819
Hold the gun and pull it out.

1474
02:59:14,819 --> 02:59:21,079
Is this like 60 rounds?

1475
02:59:21,079 --> 02:59:25,510
I don't need money.

1476
02:59:25,510 --> 02:59:29,510
I can't buy anything.

1477
02:59:29,510 --> 02:59:49,430
I can afford the pirate gun for rushing B.

1478
02:59:49,430 --> 03:00:21,370
Let's fucking go.

1479
03:00:21,370 --> 03:00:26,500
Teams.

1480
03:00:26,500 --> 03:00:33,530
I don't know what to pick.

1481
03:00:33,530 --> 03:00:37,700
I'm not sure.

1482
03:00:37,700 --> 03:01:07,059
I'm going to be Reaper.

1483
03:01:07,059 --> 03:01:12,569
I panicked.

1484
03:01:12,569 --> 03:01:24,870
I don't know what to do in these scenarios.

1485
03:01:24,870 --> 03:01:29,180
I'm going to server.

1486
03:01:29,180 --> 03:01:45,180
There's too much.

1487
03:01:45,180 --> 03:01:52,860
Headphones are gone.

1488
03:01:52,860 --> 03:01:56,860
That's not how a shotgun is held.

1489
03:01:56,860 --> 03:02:01,930
That's not how a shotgun is held.

1490
03:02:01,930 --> 03:02:08,010
Jesus Christ.

1491
03:02:08,010 --> 03:02:12,180
Are we going to the climbing game?

1492
03:02:12,180 --> 03:02:19,819
What am I supposed to do with this?

1493
03:02:19,819 --> 03:02:23,819
What am I supposed to do with this?

1494
03:02:23,819 --> 03:02:32,840
What am I supposed to do with this?

1495
03:02:32,840 --> 03:02:42,250
This is too expensive.

1496
03:02:42,250 --> 03:02:48,659
I'm not supposed to own this.

1497
03:02:48,659 --> 03:02:52,659
This was like a $75 gun that my mother bought me.

1498
03:02:52,659 --> 03:03:14,870
Buy armor.

1499
03:03:14,870 --> 03:03:19,180
I aimed for the head.

1500
03:03:19,180 --> 03:03:25,139
It was a very heavy statue gun.

1501
03:03:25,139 --> 03:03:35,180
Where is this?

1502
03:03:35,180 --> 03:03:39,670
That's bad.

1503
03:03:39,670 --> 03:03:43,670
That was a 1 in 10 game.

1504
03:03:43,670 --> 03:03:47,670
You almost had it.

1505
03:03:47,670 --> 03:03:52,940
Are there other people that want to go in it?

1506
03:03:52,940 --> 03:03:59,479
Are there people that want to play?

1507
03:03:59,479 --> 03:04:04,170
What?

1508
03:04:04,170 --> 03:04:15,190
That's a good joke.

1509
03:04:15,190 --> 03:04:19,750
What are you doing?

1510
03:04:19,750 --> 03:04:23,750
You're waiting for me?

1511
03:04:23,750 --> 03:04:27,750
What did you just do for a game mode?

1512
03:04:27,750 --> 03:04:31,750
TDM?

1513
03:04:31,750 --> 03:04:38,170
Walking around corners is the hardest thing.

1514
03:05:09,000 --> 03:05:17,620
I'm trying to get the sidearm.

1515
03:05:17,620 --> 03:05:27,459
Give me the shotgun.

1516
03:05:27,459 --> 03:05:32,840
I'm ready for 5 guns.

1517
03:05:32,840 --> 03:05:37,959
I'm too slow.

1518
03:05:37,959 --> 03:05:44,569
What did I do?

1519
03:05:44,569 --> 03:05:51,780
What?

1520
03:05:51,780 --> 03:06:09,399
You bastard.

1521
03:06:09,399 --> 03:06:26,360
I'm so sorry.

1522
03:06:26,360 --> 03:06:30,360
I saw a person teleport in front of me.

1523
03:06:30,360 --> 03:06:48,469
There's a guy behind you.

1524
03:06:48,469 --> 03:07:15,799
I got him.

1525
03:07:15,799 --> 03:07:21,690
Get over there.

1526
03:07:21,690 --> 03:07:32,379
What's happening?

1527
03:07:32,379 --> 03:07:44,329
That's not good.

1528
03:07:44,329 --> 03:07:48,760
I'm so sorry everybody.

1529
03:07:48,760 --> 03:07:52,760
That had to be the worst offense ever.

1530
03:07:52,760 --> 03:07:56,760
I was reloading the gun.

1531
03:07:56,760 --> 03:08:06,739
It wasn't that bad?

1532
03:08:06,739 --> 03:08:15,379
What did you just give me?

1533
03:08:15,379 --> 03:08:20,309
I've run a full lap.

1534
03:08:20,309 --> 03:08:24,309
The inside of my ear is straight water.

1535
03:08:24,309 --> 03:08:38,790
There's no way these are staying in for more than 5 seconds at a time.

1536
03:08:38,790 --> 03:08:43,350
I don't want this little thing.

1537
03:08:43,350 --> 03:08:47,350
Oh god.

1538
03:08:47,350 --> 03:09:09,000
That's what I'm talking about.

1539
03:09:09,000 --> 03:09:22,229
Bread and butter.

1540
03:09:22,229 --> 03:09:28,389
That's what I'm talking about with my bread and butter.

1541
03:09:28,389 --> 03:09:32,870
My lighthouse.

1542
03:09:32,870 --> 03:09:44,260
I broke it.

1543
03:09:44,260 --> 03:09:55,209
I'm just running a marathon.

1544
03:09:55,209 --> 03:10:00,020
Where's the button to press to make this work?

1545
03:10:00,020 --> 03:10:14,889
What happened?

1546
03:10:14,889 --> 03:10:18,889
There was someone the whole time.

1547
03:10:18,889 --> 03:10:26,700
Wait.

1548
03:10:26,700 --> 03:10:32,790
I don't understand.

1549
03:10:32,790 --> 03:10:38,760
There's a guy on the ceiling.

1550
03:10:38,760 --> 03:10:47,350
It was a grenade.

1551
03:10:47,350 --> 03:10:54,409
I think I might have to go to the bathroom.

1552
03:10:54,409 --> 03:11:03,610
What?

1553
03:11:03,610 --> 03:11:07,610
I swear.

1554
03:11:07,610 --> 03:11:13,379
This is one of those games where my thumb is really hurting.

1555
03:11:13,379 --> 03:11:19,209
This game is wild.

1556
03:11:19,209 --> 03:11:24,540
Run!

1557
03:11:24,540 --> 03:11:28,540
Save us!

1558
03:11:28,540 --> 03:11:43,000
I'm losing my mind.

1559
03:11:43,000 --> 03:11:47,000
My tail is wrapping around me.

1560
03:11:47,000 --> 03:12:02,899
Oh my god.

1561
03:12:02,899 --> 03:12:06,899
The drink?

1562
03:12:06,899 --> 03:12:13,899
You scared the shit out of me.

1563
03:12:13,899 --> 03:12:23,700
I thought I dumped it on the ground.

1564
03:12:23,700 --> 03:12:31,659
That would be horrible.

1565
03:12:31,659 --> 03:12:36,600
This is ridiculous.

1566
03:12:36,600 --> 03:12:40,600
I'll do one more and then we can move on.

1567
03:12:40,600 --> 03:12:46,700
Gun game was fun.

1568
03:12:46,700 --> 03:12:56,870
I think I gave up trying to get this thing.

1569
03:12:56,870 --> 03:13:02,760
Now I've got to wipe my disgusting headset.

1570
03:13:02,760 --> 03:13:33,450
I'm almost back.

1571
03:13:33,450 --> 03:13:38,520
Don't shoot me.

1572
03:13:38,520 --> 03:13:42,520
I feel like I can hear footsteps on the other side of the map.

1573
03:13:42,520 --> 03:14:03,770
Shit! Nice shot.

1574
03:14:03,770 --> 03:14:08,389
What do they say?

1575
03:14:08,389 --> 03:14:18,120
They say game up.

1576
03:14:18,120 --> 03:14:22,120
Twitch energy drink mode?

1577
03:14:22,120 --> 03:15:14,540
What the hell does that mean?

1578
03:15:14,540 --> 03:15:24,280
Game on.

1579
03:15:24,280 --> 03:15:28,520
The gun doesn't even make a noise.

1580
03:15:28,520 --> 03:15:34,020
Don't say that.

1581
03:15:34,020 --> 03:15:58,360
You just spoiled the whole show.

1582
03:15:58,360 --> 03:16:10,440
Like your avatar.

1583
03:16:10,440 --> 03:16:14,809
Sometimes it pumps in my cheek.

1584
03:16:14,809 --> 03:16:20,010
How can I have somebody be in front of me?

1585
03:16:20,010 --> 03:16:43,059
Nobody around.

1586
03:16:43,059 --> 03:17:07,620
Wow!

1587
03:17:07,620 --> 03:17:11,620
Watch out there.

1588
03:17:11,620 --> 03:17:50,520
Did I do it?

1589
03:17:50,520 --> 03:18:01,739
Behind you guys.

1590
03:18:01,739 --> 03:18:08,409
This isn't fair.

1591
03:18:08,409 --> 03:18:13,350
I was supposed to win.

1592
03:18:13,350 --> 03:18:20,020
Why are we watching Jeremy be bad at games?

1593
03:18:20,020 --> 03:18:26,680
Do you understand how hard this is to do?

1594
03:18:26,680 --> 03:18:31,430
No.

1595
03:18:31,430 --> 03:18:37,020
It's harder when you're short.

1596
03:18:37,020 --> 03:18:42,579
Game on.

1597
03:18:42,579 --> 03:18:47,510
You just did it.

1598
03:18:47,510 --> 03:19:03,450
You're never going to see him again.

1599
03:19:03,450 --> 03:19:17,219
Wait for people to come from exactly right there.

1600
03:19:17,219 --> 03:19:54,200
Don't worry, I'm behind you guys.

1601
03:19:54,200 --> 03:20:02,059
He's behind me.

1602
03:20:02,059 --> 03:20:08,260
Stop! I'm concentrating.

1603
03:20:08,260 --> 03:20:25,989
He's behind you.

1604
03:20:25,989 --> 03:20:37,059
He's behind us.

1605
03:20:37,059 --> 03:20:42,520
No, I will not.

1606
03:20:42,520 --> 03:20:46,520
Was I behind you?

1607
03:20:46,520 --> 03:21:00,729
He was behind me.

1608
03:21:00,729 --> 03:21:23,829
We both can't hit each other.

1609
03:21:23,829 --> 03:21:30,760
What the hell are you doing?

1610
03:21:30,760 --> 03:22:21,459
My hand is breaking.

1611
03:22:21,459 --> 03:22:30,739
Did it change guns?

1612
03:22:30,739 --> 03:22:41,370
I was standing in my dead zone.

1613
03:22:41,370 --> 03:22:46,809
No tracking there.

1614
03:22:46,809 --> 03:23:07,350
Why is it quiet?

1615
03:23:07,350 --> 03:24:10,459
Jeremy's bad at games.

1616
03:24:10,459 --> 03:24:16,600
What?

1617
03:24:16,600 --> 03:24:27,610
This is fun as hell.

1618
03:24:27,610 --> 03:24:31,610
What a fun game.

1619
03:24:31,610 --> 03:24:38,219
Let's do it again.

1620
03:24:38,219 --> 03:24:42,969
I love this.

1621
03:24:42,969 --> 03:24:46,969
I think there's more maps on the workshop.

1622
03:24:46,969 --> 03:24:52,420
I think I can download them right through here.

1623
03:24:52,420 --> 03:24:59,270
You should be able to.

1624
03:24:59,270 --> 03:25:03,829
They all have 2 star ratings.

1625
03:25:03,829 --> 03:25:07,829
I'm not a kid, I'm 14.

1626
03:25:07,829 --> 03:25:26,860
You can't emancipate till 16.

1627
03:25:26,860 --> 03:25:48,549
That guy is in some kind of shape.

1628
03:25:48,549 --> 03:25:54,629
I think someone is behind me.

1629
03:25:54,629 --> 03:26:01,180
You have to believe.

1630
03:26:01,180 --> 03:26:05,180
You have to believe.

1631
03:26:05,180 --> 03:26:13,420
I thought he was upstairs.

1632
03:26:13,420 --> 03:26:45,670
No one can be behind me.

1633
03:26:45,670 --> 03:27:12,790
Don't say that.

1634
03:27:12,790 --> 03:27:22,260
They told you they weren't.

1635
03:27:22,260 --> 03:28:03,000
It's so hard.

1636
03:28:03,000 --> 03:28:08,889
It's so hard.

1637
03:28:08,889 --> 03:28:14,200
Let me take a look through my scope.

1638
03:28:14,200 --> 03:28:31,860
Why is that my kill?

1639
03:28:31,860 --> 03:28:42,100
Did you shoot the gun out of my hand?

1640
03:28:42,100 --> 03:29:03,899
What weapon?

1641
03:29:03,899 --> 03:29:23,940
Dime sized scope.

1642
03:29:23,940 --> 03:30:04,440
Too many people in every direction.

1643
03:30:04,440 --> 03:30:25,110
There's a monster on the ceiling.

1644
03:30:25,110 --> 03:30:46,940
That's game 2.

1645
03:30:46,940 --> 03:30:50,940
I'm getting better, but I'm not better than Guy with VR in his name.

1646
03:30:50,940 --> 03:30:54,940
I got sweat all over me.

1647
03:30:54,940 --> 03:30:59,690
I'm shaking.

1648
03:30:59,690 --> 03:31:04,059
Game 20.

1649
03:31:04,059 --> 03:31:08,870
Just one more.

1650
03:31:08,870 --> 03:31:17,260
Just one more game.

1651
03:31:17,260 --> 03:31:21,819
That's it.

1652
03:31:21,819 --> 03:31:25,819
After this one game where I don't get on the scoreboard.

1653
03:31:25,819 --> 03:31:39,750
This is the one.

1654
03:31:39,750 --> 03:31:53,819
I lit that pool up.

1655
03:31:53,819 --> 03:32:12,059
You stole that from me.

1656
03:32:12,059 --> 03:32:16,229
Where am I?

1657
03:32:16,229 --> 03:32:38,569
Somebody is behind me.

1658
03:32:38,569 --> 03:32:58,409
In both directions.

1659
03:32:58,409 --> 03:33:11,260
Did I get you?

1660
03:33:11,260 --> 03:33:19,450
I'm not listening to chat ever again.

1661
03:33:19,450 --> 03:33:23,819
I will never listen to you ever again.

1662
03:33:23,819 --> 03:33:28,760
Dump soda on the ground.

1663
03:33:28,760 --> 03:33:32,760
Unbelievable.

1664
03:33:32,760 --> 03:33:46,010
It's the first thing I see when I come out.

1665
03:33:46,010 --> 03:33:52,420
Who threw the gun?

1666
03:33:52,420 --> 03:34:04,090
My hitbox is bigger than everyone's.

1667
03:34:04,090 --> 03:34:15,299
Maybe you shouldn't have the giant setting.

1668
03:34:15,299 --> 03:34:19,299
There's one other tall guy in here.

1669
03:34:19,299 --> 03:35:16,069
Where is this coming from?

1670
03:35:16,069 --> 03:35:46,729
Excuse me.

1671
03:35:46,729 --> 03:35:56,059
I have no idea how to reload this.

1672
03:35:56,059 --> 03:36:00,229
I got like an achievement for killing him.

1673
03:36:00,229 --> 03:36:04,659
Why was there a dude that was massive?

1674
03:36:04,659 --> 03:36:09,350
He was like the size of a skyscraper.

1675
03:36:09,350 --> 03:36:14,680
I have no idea.

1676
03:36:14,680 --> 03:36:19,500
I don't even know who was tall.

1677
03:36:19,500 --> 03:36:24,549
Maybe he is just that tall.

1678
03:36:24,549 --> 03:36:28,549
He might be like 9 or 10 feet tall.

1679
03:36:28,549 --> 03:36:36,120
He's standing on a chair.

1680
03:36:36,120 --> 03:36:40,120
The last one.

1681
03:36:40,120 --> 03:37:02,520
Can you smell me?

1682
03:37:02,520 --> 03:37:11,159
Why would you ever want the fun thing?

1683
03:37:11,159 --> 03:37:54,739
I'm so close.

1684
03:37:54,739 --> 03:38:04,860
There's a wall here.

1685
03:38:04,860 --> 03:38:38,360
Where are you at?

1686
03:38:38,360 --> 03:38:48,489
The data.

1687
03:38:48,489 --> 03:38:54,520
I'm getting disoriented.

1688
03:38:54,520 --> 03:39:21,639
Thank god.

1689
03:39:21,639 --> 03:39:38,360
I just spawned there.

1690
03:39:38,360 --> 03:40:00,340
I'm going up.

1691
03:40:00,340 --> 03:40:07,819
I don't know where the hell you are.

1692
03:40:07,819 --> 03:40:14,680
I don't know where the hell you are.

1693
03:40:14,680 --> 03:40:22,360
What?

1694
03:40:22,360 --> 03:40:26,360
This is not a one shot kill?

1695
03:40:26,360 --> 03:40:30,540
This thing's not a one shot kill gun.

1696
03:40:30,540 --> 03:40:39,829
Right hand bolt.

1697
03:40:39,829 --> 03:40:43,829
I'm sorry.

1698
03:40:43,829 --> 03:40:59,959
I don't know why this gun spawns in my hand.

1699
03:40:59,959 --> 03:41:03,959
I should be used to it.

1700
03:41:03,959 --> 03:41:18,620
I'll take it.

1701
03:41:18,620 --> 03:41:39,350
Not bad.

1702
03:41:39,350 --> 03:41:50,739
I heard him.

1703
03:41:50,739 --> 03:42:04,700
I don't know how to reload.

1704
03:42:04,700 --> 03:42:16,790
That's what I want.

1705
03:42:16,790 --> 03:42:23,129
How come the guy with his hands won't run to me?

1706
03:42:23,129 --> 03:42:28,500
Thanks for playing guys.

1707
03:42:28,500 --> 03:42:33,059
That was a blast.

1708
03:42:33,059 --> 03:42:39,319
That was fun.

1709
03:42:39,319 --> 03:42:43,319
How long has it been?

1710
03:42:43,319 --> 03:42:48,760
I have no idea.

1711
03:42:48,760 --> 03:42:57,909
Sorry everybody.

1712
03:42:57,909 --> 03:43:02,860
3 hours and 45.

1713
03:43:02,860 --> 03:43:07,399
Unless there's something else you want to do.

1714
03:43:07,399 --> 03:43:11,879
I have a couple other things I could play.

1715
03:43:11,879 --> 03:43:16,500
There are a few things I could play.

1716
03:43:16,500 --> 03:43:20,739
It's up to you.

1717
03:43:20,739 --> 03:43:26,200
Let's see.

1718
03:43:26,200 --> 03:43:37,579
There's always Pulsar.

1719
03:43:37,579 --> 03:43:43,290
He's not going to budge.

1720
03:43:43,290 --> 03:43:47,850
You're going to remake it for me.

1721
03:43:47,850 --> 03:43:51,850
You need to remake it for me.

1722
03:43:51,850 --> 03:43:55,850
Beat Saber multiplayer.

1723
03:43:55,850 --> 03:44:01,180
That would be me getting my ass kicked.

1724
03:44:01,180 --> 03:44:05,180
I have a handful of things I could do.

1725
03:44:05,180 --> 03:44:09,180
That was Star by the way.

1726
03:44:09,180 --> 03:44:13,180
That's not true.

1727
03:44:13,180 --> 03:44:17,180
Twitch.tv.

1728
03:44:17,180 --> 03:44:21,860
That makes so much sense.

1729
03:44:21,860 --> 03:44:25,860
I should be able to walk.

1730
03:44:25,860 --> 03:44:30,620
That's great.

1731
03:44:30,620 --> 03:44:36,889
That was fun playing with you.

1732
03:44:36,889 --> 03:44:41,260
Enjoy Beat Saber.

1733
03:44:41,260 --> 03:44:45,930
We have D-Rail Valley.

1734
03:44:45,930 --> 03:44:56,620
Minecraft.

1735
03:44:56,620 --> 03:45:03,420
That's going to have to be another day.

1736
03:45:03,420 --> 03:45:07,420
Pavlov.

1737
03:45:07,420 --> 03:45:16,840
That was probably the best shooter for VR.

1738
03:45:16,840 --> 03:45:21,659
Let's try Disassembly.

1739
03:45:21,659 --> 03:45:29,420
You could make cars and tear them apart.

1740
03:45:29,420 --> 03:45:36,709
It looked interesting.

1741
03:45:36,709 --> 03:45:40,709
Did Gorn get an update yet?

1742
03:45:40,709 --> 03:45:45,020
I don't think it has.

1743
03:45:45,020 --> 03:45:49,020
Last time I tried to play Gorn with the same settings,

1744
03:45:49,020 --> 03:45:56,180
there was a performance update.

1745
03:45:56,180 --> 03:46:04,200
I don't think they updated it yet.

1746
03:46:04,200 --> 03:46:20,010
Are you sure?

1747
03:46:20,010 --> 03:46:29,559
I'm just going to open it and see what happens.

1748
03:46:29,559 --> 03:46:36,090
The beta build reportedly fixed it.

1749
03:46:36,090 --> 03:46:46,010
How does this look?

1750
03:46:46,010 --> 03:47:05,579
Before it was like 20 frames a second.

1751
03:47:05,579 --> 03:47:13,750
Are you okay?

1752
03:47:13,750 --> 03:47:19,979
That looks a lot better.

1753
03:47:19,979 --> 03:47:33,420
I should have dragged it that fast.

1754
03:47:33,420 --> 03:47:38,420
What the fuck is wrong with me?

1755
03:47:38,420 --> 03:47:47,829
The vroom guy has to go home.

1756
03:47:47,829 --> 03:47:52,139
This is what he does for work.

1757
03:47:52,139 --> 03:47:57,909
He gets paid $50 an hour to drive fast.

1758
03:47:57,909 --> 03:48:05,459
What do you do for work?

1759
03:48:05,459 --> 03:48:09,829
It's funny you say that.

1760
03:48:09,829 --> 03:48:14,069
I just drive around in a circle.

1761
03:48:14,069 --> 03:48:18,760
It's hard to explain.

1762
03:48:18,760 --> 03:48:22,940
Twitch streamers try to explain their income.

1763
03:48:22,940 --> 03:48:26,940
I'm like a guy that has a platform called car.

1764
03:48:26,940 --> 03:48:30,940
I drive around in a circle.

1765
03:48:30,940 --> 03:48:34,940
I step on the gas on this one specific strip

1766
03:48:34,940 --> 03:48:38,940
of 800 to 900 yards

1767
03:48:38,940 --> 03:48:42,940
for 12 times a day.

1768
03:48:42,940 --> 03:48:49,700
Who pays you?

1769
03:48:49,700 --> 03:48:56,420
I do. I've had a lot of money in bitcoin.

1770
03:48:56,420 --> 03:49:04,819
This is my dream.

1771
03:49:04,819 --> 03:49:09,879
That was fun.

1772
03:49:09,879 --> 03:49:13,879
More multiplayer.

1773
03:49:13,879 --> 03:49:17,879
Star couldn't figure out how to get his shit going.

1774
03:49:17,879 --> 03:49:22,950
What was that?

1775
03:49:22,950 --> 03:49:28,649
Looks like it's fixed.

1776
03:49:28,649 --> 03:49:35,180
I'm sure we'll find out real quickly here.

1777
03:49:35,180 --> 03:49:39,180
If there's a mod that has the capability

1778
03:49:39,180 --> 03:49:43,180
to change the name of the game to Gorn.

1779
03:49:43,180 --> 03:49:48,360
Grab world. Move hand here.

1780
03:49:48,360 --> 03:49:55,829
Move back.

1781
03:49:55,829 --> 03:49:59,829
Press and hold to grab world.

1782
03:49:59,829 --> 03:50:03,829
I have different controls set up.

1783
03:50:03,829 --> 03:50:08,260
What the fuck was that?

1784
03:50:08,260 --> 03:50:24,709
That was very odd.

1785
03:50:24,709 --> 03:50:29,770
It's fixed.

1786
03:50:29,770 --> 03:50:33,770
Yes! This is the game everybody wanted me to play so badly.

1787
03:50:33,770 --> 03:50:37,770
Now I get to actually play it.

1788
03:50:37,770 --> 03:50:58,469
This is the one.

1789
03:50:58,469 --> 03:51:04,620
Let's kick that guy's ass.

1790
03:51:04,620 --> 03:51:13,340
One of these emote faces. This game is absurdly violent.

1791
03:51:13,340 --> 03:51:19,049
If you're not over the age of 21, don't consume alcoholic beverages.

1792
03:51:19,049 --> 03:51:25,020
This is fixed. Let's fucking go.

1793
03:51:25,020 --> 03:51:29,020
Toggle hold. Hold. Gesture.

1794
03:51:29,020 --> 03:51:33,829
Is that the only gesture? Just middle finger.

1795
03:51:33,829 --> 03:51:39,579
Real mature. Right off the bat.

1796
03:51:39,579 --> 03:51:43,579
I don't know what this is today.

1797
03:51:43,579 --> 03:51:49,399
I've done it like five times today.

1798
03:51:49,399 --> 03:51:57,340
Let's go. Gesture. Hold. Toggle hold.

1799
03:51:57,340 --> 03:52:01,340
Let's go.

1800
03:52:01,340 --> 03:52:11,579
Streamer tells audience to fuck off.

1801
03:52:11,579 --> 03:52:19,379
When did I do that?

1802
03:52:19,379 --> 03:52:23,379
Toggle hold.

1803
03:52:23,379 --> 03:52:27,379
Okay.

1804
03:52:27,379 --> 03:52:32,700
So is there a quick turn?

1805
03:52:32,700 --> 03:52:36,700
Or do I actually have to turn?

1806
03:52:36,700 --> 03:52:46,100
Alright. Let's go.

1807
03:52:46,100 --> 03:52:50,340
Is there a block or a parry?

1808
03:52:50,340 --> 03:53:01,590
Is this what you want?

1809
03:53:01,590 --> 03:53:10,680
Is this what you want to see?

1810
03:53:10,680 --> 03:53:22,629
Come here.

1811
03:53:22,629 --> 03:53:26,870
Ooh. I broke his ankle.

1812
03:53:26,870 --> 03:53:31,049
How's the audio?

1813
03:53:31,049 --> 03:53:35,860
Label?

1814
03:53:35,860 --> 03:53:40,489
Good.

1815
03:53:40,489 --> 03:53:45,180
Okay.

1816
03:53:45,180 --> 03:53:50,760
How do I grab this?

1817
03:53:50,760 --> 03:53:57,180
There we go. This is like a rubber mace.

1818
03:53:57,180 --> 03:54:11,370
Alright. Bring it on. Next wave. Still alive?

1819
03:54:11,370 --> 03:54:20,969
You gotta go. You gotta break their arms.

1820
03:54:20,969 --> 03:54:30,840
Holy shit. I just blew up that guy's head. Watch out.

1821
03:54:30,840 --> 03:54:43,799
Oh my god. That's terrible.

1822
03:54:43,799 --> 03:54:48,229
You got shin pads? I see. I see. I get you.

1823
03:54:48,229 --> 03:55:11,190
Come on. On the ground. Right in the chest.

1824
03:55:11,190 --> 03:55:15,690
I fucking won!

1825
03:55:15,690 --> 03:55:20,870
This is actually really fun.

1826
03:55:20,870 --> 03:55:24,870
Do I just have to keep going?

1827
03:55:24,870 --> 03:55:29,690
Shield this time. Okay. I want this in my right hand.

1828
03:55:29,690 --> 03:55:38,950
Excuse me.

1829
03:55:38,950 --> 03:55:48,489
Okay. Easy.

1830
03:55:48,489 --> 03:56:01,739
This is a huge shield. It's like an umbrella.

1831
03:56:01,739 --> 03:56:12,659
Can I hit myself in the face?

1832
03:56:12,659 --> 03:56:28,090
Oops-a-daisy. Easy here. Right in the legs.

1833
03:56:28,090 --> 03:56:38,059
Come on! Oh, is this your friend?

1834
03:56:38,059 --> 03:56:43,260
How come these guys don't have armor? They're just free kills.

1835
03:56:43,260 --> 03:56:50,739
Rip off someone's head?

1836
03:56:50,739 --> 03:56:54,739
Oh, okay. So there's a champion at the end of this.

1837
03:56:54,739 --> 03:56:58,739
I gotta do this.

1838
03:56:58,739 --> 03:57:02,739
So, wait. Wait. Wait.

1839
03:57:02,739 --> 03:57:06,739
Free for all? I don't have a weapon.

1840
03:57:06,739 --> 03:57:10,979
Oh, fuck. Give me a weapon.

1841
03:57:10,979 --> 03:57:29,370
Give me that. Come here.

1842
03:57:29,370 --> 03:57:52,459
I think he's dead. I'm getting wrapped up in my cord. Uh-oh.

1843
03:57:52,459 --> 03:57:56,459
Careful there's a wall.

1844
03:57:56,459 --> 03:58:00,760
I'm actually getting stuck.

1845
03:58:00,760 --> 03:58:06,920
Stuck. Oh, god. I'm getting close to something.

1846
03:58:06,920 --> 03:58:18,459
I know it. I can feel it. How many more? Free for all?

1847
03:58:18,459 --> 03:58:27,420
Until what? Until everyone's dead? Oh, you can throw shit too.

1848
03:58:27,420 --> 03:58:31,959
Come here.

1849
03:58:31,959 --> 03:58:37,659
I just fucking Curly, Moe, and Larry.

1850
03:58:37,659 --> 03:58:41,959
Whatever their names are. It's free punks.

1851
03:58:41,959 --> 03:58:56,090
I did it! What's the final channel?

1852
03:58:56,090 --> 03:59:03,319
Okay.

1853
03:59:07,319 --> 03:59:11,319
Alright, let me get ready here. Let me get ready.

1854
03:59:11,319 --> 03:59:25,260
Bring it on. Alright, does it get like a gulp mask on?

1855
03:59:25,260 --> 03:59:33,319
I'll take that. You ain't gonna be fighting anymore.

1856
03:59:33,319 --> 03:59:40,229
Oh, it took his whole arm off.

1857
03:59:40,229 --> 03:59:44,229
That guy was easier than the default enemies.

1858
03:59:44,229 --> 03:59:53,450
I almost just hit the wall. It's okay.

1859
03:59:53,450 --> 03:59:59,530
Alright, Achilles. General? What's Achilles?

1860
03:59:59,530 --> 04:00:06,709
This is easy. Soda. The soda spilled. Oh, no.

1861
04:00:06,709 --> 04:00:13,899
You don't have a camera anymore. You opened the door and walked outside.

1862
04:00:13,899 --> 04:00:23,180
I can see the soda on the table, guys.

1863
04:00:23,180 --> 04:00:27,610
Should we go to tier two? How does this work?

1864
04:00:27,610 --> 04:00:34,520
I can only do tier one. I'm just gonna go to Achilles.

1865
04:00:34,520 --> 04:00:41,379
It is.

1866
04:00:45,379 --> 04:00:50,069
This is a proper sword. This isn't a real sword.

1867
04:00:50,069 --> 04:00:57,579
This is a fake sword. So we got slicing action.

1868
04:00:57,579 --> 04:01:01,579
I gotta cut a leg off. Oh, my God.

1869
04:01:01,579 --> 04:01:10,100
That was actually really cool.

1870
04:01:10,100 --> 04:01:23,299
Holy shit.

1871
04:01:23,299 --> 04:01:28,889
How do I rip somebody's head off?

1872
04:01:28,889 --> 04:01:46,299
Take a body of limbs and your head.

1873
04:01:46,299 --> 04:02:07,350
How do I rip his head off?

1874
04:02:07,350 --> 04:02:30,379
How do I do that?

1875
04:02:30,379 --> 04:02:34,379
Well, that was absolutely brutal.

1876
04:02:34,379 --> 04:02:39,190
Where's the new weapon? It's Battle Axe.

1877
04:02:39,190 --> 04:02:44,889
Yes. Jesus. Yeah, that was pretty insane.

1878
04:02:44,889 --> 04:02:49,450
Two hands? No. A little slower movement on this one, I think.

1879
04:02:49,450 --> 04:02:58,659
Yeah, a little bit.

1880
04:02:58,659 --> 04:03:11,719
Legs. Try to sweep underneath.

1881
04:03:11,719 --> 04:03:23,299
Are you still swinging at me?

1882
04:03:23,299 --> 04:03:27,299
How are you still doing this?

1883
04:03:27,299 --> 04:03:34,600
How are you still doing this? Oh, my God.

1884
04:03:34,600 --> 04:03:39,399
Whoa. I took his chin off.

1885
04:03:39,399 --> 04:03:45,819
Shit, he hit me.

1886
04:03:45,819 --> 04:03:52,790
Oh, there's bow and arrows in this game?

1887
04:03:52,790 --> 04:04:05,139
Come here.

1888
04:04:05,139 --> 04:04:10,280
Whatever. He's dead.

1889
04:04:10,280 --> 04:04:14,579
You fight that guy, eventually.

1890
04:04:14,579 --> 04:04:18,579
I'm going to get taught.

1891
04:04:18,579 --> 04:04:23,979
Okay.

1892
04:04:23,979 --> 04:04:27,979
Alright, so we got blunt.

1893
04:04:27,979 --> 04:04:31,979
We got our little hammer here.

1894
04:04:31,979 --> 04:04:40,120
Let's go for, I'm going to say shoulders.

1895
04:04:40,120 --> 04:04:54,389
Go club. This guy's got plate armor on.

1896
04:04:54,389 --> 04:05:31,750
That's new. What weapon? Something else I can use?

1897
04:05:31,750 --> 04:05:35,750
Oh, fuck. It's kind of hard for me to do two at the same time.

1898
04:05:35,750 --> 04:05:39,750
I'm dead. Yeah, do well with this control setup because

1899
04:05:39,750 --> 04:05:43,750
when you have two weapons, this no longer

1900
04:05:43,750 --> 04:05:47,750
is like walk. So, it's hard to do two.

1901
04:05:47,750 --> 04:05:56,139
This is like better for shield for me. Because then I have to use this to walk when I swing

1902
04:05:56,139 --> 04:06:17,899
with this hand. Come here.

1903
04:06:17,899 --> 04:06:36,969
Good night. What else you got? Grab the armor first.

1904
04:06:36,969 --> 04:06:47,540
Nope. Just kidding. Watch out, there's a wall somewhere here. I want that axe.

1905
04:06:47,540 --> 04:07:08,899
Hello? There we go.

1906
04:07:08,899 --> 04:07:17,100
Anymore?

1907
04:07:17,100 --> 04:07:21,100
This is a soda.

1908
04:07:21,100 --> 04:07:27,829
Okay, what do we got?

1909
04:07:27,829 --> 04:07:34,340
Okay. Hmm.

1910
04:07:34,340 --> 04:07:51,829
I wasn't a fan of this last time, but I'll try it again.

1911
04:07:51,829 --> 04:08:11,370
See what I mean? I can't walk forward. Because when I raise

1912
04:08:11,370 --> 04:08:15,370
my hand up, it's like, are you sure you're moving? It's not ideal.

1913
04:08:15,370 --> 04:08:21,299
See when I lift my hand up, even if I'm trying to

1914
04:08:21,299 --> 04:08:25,299
walk forward, I go backwards. So, I have to go backwards

1915
04:08:25,299 --> 04:08:50,340
when I lift my hand up here. It's weird.

1916
04:08:50,340 --> 04:09:11,829
Come here. I don't think so.

1917
04:09:11,829 --> 04:09:17,270
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Good thing I had the hand scraps on.

1918
04:09:17,270 --> 04:09:21,270
That was a broken glass. Something would have shattered.

1919
04:09:21,270 --> 04:09:43,899
Arrows. Goodbye. Yes!

1920
04:09:43,899 --> 04:09:51,020
Is there a multiplayer in this game?

1921
04:09:51,020 --> 04:09:56,149
I don't think there is.

1922
04:09:56,149 --> 04:10:00,149
Okay, here comes Achilles.

1923
04:10:00,149 --> 04:10:05,979
Where am I? Ooh.

1924
04:10:05,979 --> 04:10:09,979
Alright, I'm going to go with just one hand here.

1925
04:10:09,979 --> 04:10:25,670
I'm way better with one hand.

1926
04:10:25,670 --> 04:10:32,409
Let me see his leg. That's why your name is Achilles!

1927
04:10:32,409 --> 04:10:46,309
That would make sense, wouldn't it? I guess that's throwing shit.

1928
04:10:46,309 --> 04:10:55,139
Oh, what a clever boy. Achilles.

1929
04:10:55,139 --> 04:11:01,610
Preserker. General. Well, we can go into tier two.

1930
04:11:01,610 --> 04:11:13,000
What is general? Is general just

1931
04:11:13,000 --> 04:11:24,069
like the general? Badgermancer.

1932
04:11:24,069 --> 04:11:29,909
Everybody seems to want to see this one.

1933
04:11:38,840 --> 04:11:44,299
This control is...

1934
04:11:44,299 --> 04:11:48,860
Okay. I like spears in these games.

1935
04:11:48,860 --> 04:12:00,709
I'm going to have to move around with the right stick here.

1936
04:12:00,709 --> 04:12:10,760
Really slippery though. I guess I can just swing.

1937
04:12:10,760 --> 04:12:14,760
Nope. I need to go the other direction.

1938
04:12:14,760 --> 04:12:24,940
Come here. I need to, yeah, I gotta go the

1939
04:12:24,940 --> 04:12:39,190
other way. Alright, you can pick people up, I think.

1940
04:12:39,190 --> 04:12:47,899
Come here.

1941
04:12:47,899 --> 04:12:57,299
What is happening? Alright, let go of this.

1942
04:12:57,299 --> 04:13:05,430
I don't want to use this thing anymore. That's what I'm talking

1943
04:13:05,430 --> 04:13:17,159
about. That's much better. This thing is so tangled.

1944
04:13:17,159 --> 04:13:54,899
Jeremy, you're a sicko. Oops-a-daisy.

1945
04:13:54,899 --> 04:14:16,790
That thing looks kind of fun. Oh, I thought you went under.

1946
04:14:16,790 --> 04:14:48,790
I thought he went down. Oh, shit. Is he dead? Yeah.

1947
04:14:48,790 --> 04:15:07,000
I'm ripping his head off. Oh, fuck it.

1948
04:15:07,000 --> 04:15:11,940
Oops. What? Did I bump into my thing?

1949
04:15:11,940 --> 04:15:18,969
Open it up.

1950
04:15:18,969 --> 04:15:27,110
Ugh.

1951
04:15:27,110 --> 04:15:32,170
One, two, three. Oops-a-daisy. That didn't work.

1952
04:15:32,170 --> 04:15:37,930
That did not work like I intended it to.

1953
04:15:37,930 --> 04:15:47,350
Oh, the goddamn controller.

1954
04:15:47,350 --> 04:15:56,309
I'm going to die.

1955
04:15:56,309 --> 04:16:01,059
Oh, I'm exhausted.

1956
04:16:01,059 --> 04:16:05,620
I really wish it, okay, so this is the worst part.

1957
04:16:05,620 --> 04:16:09,620
Ready? I'm moving forward. Now I'm moving backward.

1958
04:16:09,620 --> 04:16:13,620
It doesn't matter. I'm holding here. Now we're going this way.

1959
04:16:13,620 --> 04:16:17,620
I wish it was just forward because now I have to go. I have to switch to back.

1960
04:16:17,620 --> 04:16:21,620
It's literally, it's just whatever direction the track pad is in.

1961
04:16:21,620 --> 04:16:29,510
I'd rather just have this be forward.

1962
04:16:29,510 --> 04:17:31,379
Will you stop? Bring him on. Yeah, crash.

1963
04:17:31,379 --> 04:18:09,700
Look at that dude. Oh, trying to do a cool move. Trying to throw him in the air.

1964
04:18:09,700 --> 04:18:19,559
Does that guy have a t-shirt on?

1965
04:18:19,559 --> 04:18:40,040
That guy just almost did the look at me. He's close.

1966
04:18:40,040 --> 04:18:47,909
One, two, three. Is this it? Last guy.

1967
04:18:47,909 --> 04:18:55,620
Come here.

1968
04:18:55,620 --> 04:19:00,059
This is fucking so much fun.

1969
04:19:00,059 --> 04:19:05,819
Spikes? Oh, shit. Those are spikes.

1970
04:19:05,819 --> 04:19:11,340
What are those? What is on me?

1971
04:19:11,340 --> 04:19:27,799
Spiderman grips? Wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Give me, give me, give me.

1972
04:19:27,799 --> 04:19:41,819
Give me that back. They're like boomerangs? Okay.

1973
04:19:41,819 --> 04:19:53,399
That's really cool. Holy shit.

1974
04:19:53,399 --> 04:20:16,469
This is too much.

1975
04:20:16,469 --> 04:20:29,510
No. Those things are really fun. I'm running out of gas so I'm not going to lie.

1976
04:20:29,510 --> 04:20:34,840
I'm running out of gas. I didn't have very much left in the tank when I opened this.

1977
04:20:34,840 --> 04:20:43,610
That's a good technique. Just thunderclap.

1978
04:20:43,610 --> 04:21:03,639
I've got to throw somebody in the spikes at least once before I leave.

1979
04:21:03,639 --> 04:21:19,260
Thank you. Come here. Jesus. That worked.

1980
04:21:41,260 --> 04:21:52,579
God damn it.

1981
04:21:52,579 --> 04:21:56,760
Alright. I'm killing the badger guy and I'm done.

1982
04:21:56,760 --> 04:22:05,659
I've used all my fuel. This game is fucking awesome though.

1983
04:22:05,659 --> 04:22:22,229
That guy don't matter. We'll take care of this guy first.

1984
04:22:22,229 --> 04:22:31,700
His eyes just popped out of his head.

1985
04:22:31,700 --> 04:22:36,709
I've got this guy's like juice on me.

1986
04:22:36,709 --> 04:22:44,340
The people are stuck. Get this off.

1987
04:22:44,340 --> 04:23:02,579
How am I going to release?

1988
04:23:02,579 --> 04:23:13,100
He's still on me.

1989
04:23:13,100 --> 04:23:26,280
Alright.

1990
04:23:26,280 --> 04:23:30,280
Too many movement games today.

1991
04:23:30,280 --> 04:23:37,510
The climbing game. The run around shoot game.

1992
04:23:37,510 --> 04:23:41,819
It's been just exercising for four hours.

1993
04:23:41,819 --> 04:24:10,420
I'm running on a treadmill for four hours.

1994
04:24:10,420 --> 04:24:25,270
I want the bow. Let me try the bow. How does this work?

1995
04:24:25,270 --> 04:24:32,649
Wow. That's fun. Give me the arrow battery.

1996
04:24:32,649 --> 04:24:47,420
I'm going to use this.

1997
04:24:47,420 --> 04:24:57,770
That didn't go very far.

1998
04:24:57,770 --> 04:25:11,659
Not good. Give me something else.

1999
04:25:11,659 --> 04:25:17,479
I hate that control scheme. It's going to make me scream.

2000
04:25:17,479 --> 04:25:43,000
Can I change that?

2001
04:25:47,750 --> 04:25:53,059
Funny.

2002
04:25:53,059 --> 04:25:57,059
Are we going to get a comedy level?

2003
04:25:57,059 --> 04:26:13,750
A little stabber?

2004
04:26:13,750 --> 04:26:36,579
I'm doing it like real life.

2005
04:26:36,579 --> 04:26:53,500
Come here. You can pick him up and you can

2006
04:26:53,500 --> 04:27:03,780
skewer him. That's amazing.

2007
04:27:03,780 --> 04:27:20,299
See you later. That did so good.

2008
04:27:20,299 --> 04:27:30,809
What happened to your arm?

2009
04:27:30,809 --> 04:27:34,809
Your arm is not doing so well.

2010
04:27:34,809 --> 04:27:49,829
Goodbye.

2011
04:27:49,829 --> 04:27:59,370
Alright. Boss time after this, right?

2012
04:27:59,370 --> 04:28:06,540
You're dead?

2013
04:28:06,540 --> 04:28:20,260
What?

2014
04:28:20,260 --> 04:28:25,700
What? What happened there?

2015
04:28:25,700 --> 04:28:31,860
I don't understand. What was hitting me?

2016
04:28:31,860 --> 04:28:42,940
There was nobody else behind me. You have to kill somebody to live.

2017
04:28:42,940 --> 04:28:48,250
He hit me once and I feel like I shouldn't have died there.

2018
04:28:48,250 --> 04:28:58,010
Is it like a fast

2019
04:28:58,010 --> 04:29:02,700
kill for these things? This thing is fun but

2020
04:29:02,700 --> 04:29:08,459
I'd rather just use my weapon.

2021
04:29:08,459 --> 04:29:35,030
I like this thing way better.

2022
04:29:35,030 --> 04:29:50,969
That feels good.

2023
04:29:50,969 --> 04:29:59,799
Alright. Watch out for the wall.

2024
04:29:59,799 --> 04:30:17,530
I was trying to get a wall.

2025
04:30:17,530 --> 04:30:58,149
Why does it just have its mind of its own? That's it?

2026
04:30:58,149 --> 04:31:06,739
Delay. Drink him.

2027
04:31:06,739 --> 04:31:13,610
Badger Mancer.

2028
04:31:13,610 --> 04:31:26,469
Here it comes. Let's go.

2029
04:31:26,469 --> 04:31:51,159
Do I get a weapon? Do they come after me?

2030
04:31:51,159 --> 04:32:03,059
What do I do?

2031
04:32:03,059 --> 04:32:07,559
What's going on? What's happening?

2032
04:32:07,559 --> 04:32:13,780
Why is it still giving me a chance?

2033
04:32:13,780 --> 04:32:25,180
I'm going to go kick the shit out of him.

2034
04:32:25,180 --> 04:32:35,079
I'm going to get fucking hurt.

2035
04:32:44,620 --> 04:33:00,280
I did it!

2036
04:33:00,280 --> 04:33:04,279
I ran out of fuel 40 minutes ago.

2037
04:33:04,279 --> 04:33:17,849
You get special weapons after you beat the bosses. That's actually really fun.

2038
04:33:17,849 --> 04:33:23,220
You had grappling hooks the whole time that you didn't use.

2039
04:33:23,220 --> 04:33:33,060
Oh well. But that was a ton of fun.

2040
04:33:33,060 --> 04:33:37,060
VR is just too much fun. I wish I had more stamina.

2041
04:33:37,060 --> 04:33:48,119
End of the Badger Mancer voice.

2042
04:33:48,119 --> 04:33:55,560
Imagine the smell. I don't smell. I smell fine. That was a lot of fun.

2043
04:33:55,560 --> 04:34:01,880
Let me take this off.

2044
04:34:01,880 --> 04:34:06,889
I will see you guys on the next stream.

2045
04:34:06,889 --> 04:34:13,290
You can change the control screen. Yeah. I'll have to do that.

2046
04:34:13,290 --> 04:34:17,979
I'm not streaming tomorrow. I think the next time

2047
04:34:17,979 --> 04:34:25,740
you guys are going to see me is Wednesday.

2048
04:34:25,740 --> 04:34:34,700
Two days. Not next Wednesday.

2049
04:34:34,700 --> 04:34:41,369
Going is a lot of fun. I might have to come back and play it.

2050
04:34:41,369 --> 04:34:50,599
We're going to do a VR night where I complete the

2051
04:34:50,599 --> 04:34:58,919
games that I didn't beat. And Mind Show 2, I know.

2052
04:34:58,919 --> 04:35:02,919
There's so many experiences. The thing with Mind Show though is Mind Show should be a pretty

2053
04:35:02,919 --> 04:35:06,919
I don't think I'll play that for like three to four hours. I feel like I could

2054
04:35:06,919 --> 04:35:10,919
do that for a while because it's not a whole lot of like fucking jumping around like running and

2055
04:35:10,919 --> 04:35:18,549
breathing and up, down, up, down, twist, twist, twist.

2056
04:35:18,549 --> 04:35:23,299
But thank you everybody. I'll see you in a couple days. Like always.

2057
04:35:23,299 --> 04:35:29,580
These streams are a fucking ton of fun. Playing with Star was a lot of fun.

2058
04:35:29,580 --> 04:35:33,580
The last two days of co-op have been fucking hilarious.

2059
04:35:33,580 --> 04:35:38,069
And stressful. And fun. So it's been great.

2060
04:35:38,069 --> 04:35:42,380
Thank you everybody. I will see you all real soon. Take care of yourselves.

2061
04:35:42,380 --> 04:35:48,860
Stick around for the bits if you want to. What am I going to do on Wednesday?

2062
04:35:48,860 --> 04:35:55,369
I don't know. There's a... I could dedicate

2063
04:35:55,369 --> 04:35:59,740
Wednesday to Mind Show. Or I might put the

2064
04:35:59,740 --> 04:36:04,229
VR away for like another three or four streams. Still going to play...

2065
04:36:04,229 --> 04:36:08,470
Channel 5. Seaman. We still have that. That's been kicking around

2066
04:36:08,470 --> 04:36:20,459
for a while. Ace Attorney Trilogy comes out on the 10th of April, yeah?

2067
04:36:20,459 --> 04:36:30,040
Oh man, oh man. There's a lot to do. Stupid Invaders

2068
04:36:30,040 --> 04:36:37,990
Disc 1. You know, it's true. Let's get the outro going here.

2069
04:36:37,990 --> 04:36:48,119
Yeah, a lot of people

2070
04:36:48,119 --> 04:36:52,119
have been watching these streams. I'm

2071
04:36:52,119 --> 04:36:56,119
very happy that people are liking them. There's been a lot of positive

2072
04:36:56,119 --> 04:37:00,119
feedback on the VR stream, so I'm really happy.

2073
04:37:00,119 --> 04:37:08,779
I'm glad it can be fun. It's a very enjoyable experience,

2074
04:37:08,779 --> 04:37:15,380
I think. At least for me. At least for you too. Do Onward?

2075
04:37:15,380 --> 04:37:20,069
Yeah, we'll have to do it. I have it now, so it's time to do a bunch of it.

2076
04:37:20,069 --> 04:37:31,779
Let me close out of this. Finish Dreadhalls?

2077
04:37:31,779 --> 04:37:35,779
Yeah, we'll do like a finish the game stream. Not

2078
04:37:35,779 --> 04:37:40,279
necessarily on Wednesday, but I'm not sure. I'll be around. I'll be around in the Discord.

2079
04:37:40,279 --> 04:37:44,279
I'll be around in the chat here

2080
04:37:44,279 --> 04:37:51,270
in like a day or so. We'll talk about what we're going to do.

2081
04:37:51,270 --> 04:38:01,900
But I am pooped, as they say.

2082
04:38:01,900 --> 04:38:05,900
Let's head back a little earlier, a few hours ago, about four and a half hours ago.

2083
04:38:05,900 --> 04:38:22,220
Where do we start here? Yeah, right there.

2084
04:38:22,220 --> 04:38:26,520
Thank you to Divus five hours ago for the 250.

2085
04:38:26,520 --> 04:38:32,099
Appreciate it. Also thank you to

2086
04:38:32,099 --> 04:38:37,240
Take Me Home for the 250. You can set SteamVR to show your

2087
04:38:37,240 --> 04:38:41,669
IRL surroundings if you get close to a wall. Yeah, it's already there.

2088
04:38:41,669 --> 04:38:46,299
I have the blue thing set up, but when you get heated, you get

2089
04:38:46,299 --> 04:38:50,860
in the moment. It's so hard, because you're focused on

2090
04:38:50,860 --> 04:38:54,860
what's happening in the game. And even with the blue bars,

2091
04:38:54,860 --> 04:39:10,409
it can be very, very hard to avoid them. Oh, there they are.

2092
04:39:10,409 --> 04:39:14,900
No, it straight shows your room, not just the blue bars.

2093
04:39:14,900 --> 04:39:21,049
Oh, really? It shows the room? That's

2094
04:39:21,049 --> 04:39:26,310
weird. It's just a learn thing. The longer you play VR, you sort of remember your

2095
04:39:26,310 --> 04:39:32,090
space better, but accents still happen. It's a lot of fun.

2096
04:39:32,090 --> 04:39:37,290
Frody and Weapon Thanks for the $5 JermaJex, JermaJex 2.

2097
04:39:37,290 --> 04:39:41,290
There were two or three Jex moments tonight.

2098
04:39:41,290 --> 04:39:46,580
There were at least seven or eight

2099
04:39:46,580 --> 04:39:51,270
John moments. And there was probably 30 Jeremy moments.

2100
04:39:51,270 --> 04:39:58,939
So, it balances out, I think. Is there a

2101
04:39:58,939 --> 04:40:03,750
top 10 JermaScreaming clips from this stream? I don't think there's very much screaming.

2102
04:40:03,750 --> 04:40:09,779
No, that was a few days ago. This wasn't a scream stream.

2103
04:40:09,779 --> 04:40:13,779
This was like a try-hard shooter stream.

2104
04:40:13,779 --> 04:40:26,520
Like Star was saying before, imagine PavlovVR

2105
04:40:26,520 --> 04:40:31,900
in a competitive LAN setup, and they're all up there

2106
04:40:31,900 --> 04:40:35,900
like game show contestants hooked up to different helmets instead of computers.

2107
04:40:35,900 --> 04:40:45,049
That'd be wild. And then if they die, there's like a trap door that opens

2108
04:40:45,049 --> 04:40:49,049
and they fall out of their VR headsets and go through the trap door.

2109
04:40:49,049 --> 04:40:59,529
But thank you to

2110
04:40:59,529 --> 04:41:04,220
the Nintendo PlayStation for the $5 here.

2111
04:41:04,220 --> 04:41:09,220
Been watching you for a long time since TF2 2014.

2112
04:41:09,220 --> 04:41:14,740
Thank you. Really appreciate it. And you're currently playing Homeworld 2.

2113
04:41:14,740 --> 04:41:20,009
Homeworld 2. With like a Star Wars mod?

2114
04:41:20,009 --> 04:41:26,169
They had Star Wars mods for Homeworld?

2115
04:41:26,169 --> 04:41:32,259
That's kind of insane. But thank you, Nintendo PlayStation, for the $5 here.

2116
04:41:32,259 --> 04:41:36,500
Or actually $7 here, $7.50.

2117
04:41:36,500 --> 04:41:41,770
And they say the heavy machine gun you use is an MK48.

2118
04:41:41,770 --> 04:41:45,939
The gun appears in so many games like Black Ops 2 and it's even

2119
04:41:45,939 --> 04:41:53,180
in GTA 4. The huge one? Yeah.

2120
04:41:53,180 --> 04:42:01,380
That gun is in like every game, isn't it? That fold-out

2121
04:42:01,380 --> 04:42:06,009
like futon gun. I call that thing, that's a futon.

2122
04:42:06,009 --> 04:42:17,669
It's just a huge fold-out machine gun. Bro luck!

2123
04:42:17,669 --> 04:42:21,669
Thank you for the $2.50. Don't know if you've seen this yet. I'm not sure.

2124
04:42:21,669 --> 04:42:26,939
I'll tell you about it. Hello Moto.

2125
04:42:26,939 --> 04:42:33,990
I have not seen this. I'm not sure why I would want to see this.

2126
04:42:33,990 --> 04:42:52,869
Hello Moto Ring.

2127
04:42:52,869 --> 04:44:17,430
Oh shit. I've been like talking this whole time.

2128
04:44:17,430 --> 04:44:21,740
I don't know why that muted.

2129
04:44:21,740 --> 04:44:27,060
He's stuck in the, what was the last thing you heard me say? Motorola?

2130
04:44:27,060 --> 04:44:32,330
Oh god. Well I said, I talked about

2131
04:44:32,330 --> 04:44:36,330
D. Reggie Deddy gave me $3 and wrote something about a

2132
04:44:36,330 --> 04:44:40,330
flamethrower. It's an RPG combined.

2133
04:44:40,330 --> 04:44:44,330
It's like a plasma in the gun. And it's a link to

2134
04:44:44,330 --> 04:44:48,950
I don't even know what it is. It's a weird looking little gun thing.

2135
04:44:48,950 --> 04:44:53,639
You were just playing the music and nothing else.

2136
04:44:53,639 --> 04:44:57,639
We just heard the music.

2137
04:44:57,639 --> 04:45:02,439
I'm tired. I don't know.

2138
04:45:02,439 --> 04:45:13,900
This is what it looks like apparently. I have no idea.

2139
04:45:13,900 --> 04:45:19,349
Thank you Core Monster for the $15. That was a load of fun.

2140
04:45:19,349 --> 04:45:23,349
I was bargain binned with the pink avatar. Hope you can do this another time.

2141
04:45:23,349 --> 04:45:30,409
I was looking forward to this shit and it did not disappoint.

2142
04:45:30,409 --> 04:45:35,220
Thank you. Glad to have people participate if they can.

2143
04:45:35,220 --> 04:45:41,240
Sometimes it's hard to do. It can be tricky sometimes

2144
04:45:41,240 --> 04:45:45,610
with the amount of people that show up to streams.

2145
04:45:45,610 --> 04:45:49,610
I like to do community stuff when I can. Involve people if they want to play.

2146
04:45:49,610 --> 04:45:58,380
Thank you for the $15. Appreciate it. Glad you had fun. Cause it was fun.

2147
04:45:58,380 --> 04:46:04,200
I might not be the best VR shooter, but I tried.

2148
04:46:04,200 --> 04:46:15,020
Thank you again Core Monster for the $15.

2149
04:46:15,020 --> 04:46:20,470
Thank you also to Nintendo Playstation for $12.

2150
04:46:20,470 --> 04:46:26,740
I have an idea. Get VR troopers.

2151
04:46:26,740 --> 04:46:32,630
It's a better headset. I disagree.

2152
04:46:32,630 --> 04:46:40,569
Thank you though.

2153
04:46:40,569 --> 04:46:48,259
I'm going sicko.

2154
04:46:48,259 --> 04:46:52,759
I didn't do very well for a lot of those.

2155
04:46:52,759 --> 04:46:56,759
There was a few rounds of the gun game.

2156
04:46:56,759 --> 04:47:00,759
I was really feeling it. I could just feel the weight.

2157
04:47:00,759 --> 04:47:05,580
I was pretending. You have to actually move your arms.

2158
04:47:05,580 --> 04:47:11,610
I came into fourth place one of those times.

2159
04:47:11,610 --> 04:47:21,270
Sick Jax.

2160
04:47:21,270 --> 04:47:26,409
Sicko mode is a great song, but the meme is getting very old at this point.

2161
04:47:26,409 --> 04:47:34,099
I don't even know what it is. Poor Boomer has to do physical exercise.

2162
04:47:34,099 --> 04:47:38,099
What was me? I had to get up and move for four and a half hours.

2163
04:47:38,099 --> 04:47:47,779
Also we had the

2164
04:47:47,779 --> 04:47:52,090
Jewish Bro came in with about $4 here.

2165
04:47:52,090 --> 04:47:57,099
Could you play Seaman and more shitty games on Wednesday?

2166
04:47:57,099 --> 04:48:03,130
VR is fun, but let's go back to the basics.

2167
04:48:03,130 --> 04:48:07,750
I'm of the opinion. If I'm having a good time, I'm going to keep having a good time.

2168
04:48:07,750 --> 04:48:13,340
I definitely don't want to do exclusively

2169
04:48:13,340 --> 04:48:17,340
only VR, but it is a brand new toy.

2170
04:48:17,340 --> 04:48:27,080
I was tired after just the Pavlov match. That's a lot of exertion.

2171
04:48:27,080 --> 04:48:31,080
Jerma did Climey and Gorn today.

2172
04:48:31,080 --> 04:48:35,380
Before Climey, Star's computer broke in the chef game.

2173
04:48:35,380 --> 04:48:45,560
Any plans to go to the furry convention in Chicago? Yeah, I'll be there.

2174
04:48:45,560 --> 04:48:50,310
I think they say, can you pull an all-nighter and see how long you last?

2175
04:48:50,310 --> 04:48:55,259
No, I don't stream all night.

2176
04:48:55,259 --> 04:49:03,580
I can't do that. Let's get the credits going up too.

2177
04:49:03,580 --> 04:49:09,610
All the new subs and resubs, thank you guys.

2178
04:49:09,610 --> 04:49:15,049
And his rat costume? No, his frog costume.

2179
04:49:15,049 --> 04:49:19,349
Just want to make sure everyone's really clear. Frog.

2180
04:49:19,349 --> 04:49:23,349
Oh, is he a rat? Is he a...

2181
04:49:23,349 --> 04:49:29,319
Maybe he's a fox? Nope. Frog. If I had to pick.

2182
04:49:29,319 --> 04:49:35,209
Frogs don't have fur. That doesn't matter.

2183
04:49:35,209 --> 04:49:41,860
Could be a froggy. Why do you enable them?

2184
04:49:41,860 --> 04:49:53,400
It's fun. And we had Bingo Sunshine for $5. Thank you, Bingo.

2185
04:49:53,400 --> 04:49:58,020
Whoops. You missed that one. Try another VR stream.

2186
04:49:58,020 --> 04:50:14,040
Okay, then. I'll be a penguin. See you there.

2187
04:50:14,040 --> 04:50:22,040
Someone's going to edit that clip and just cut out you saying

2188
04:50:22,040 --> 04:50:27,560
just kidding. Well, people have their...

2189
04:50:27,560 --> 04:50:33,639
The internet's a powerful place. I've said this before.

2190
04:50:33,639 --> 04:50:39,099
Think of how many sentences I've said being recorded on a microphone.

2191
04:50:39,099 --> 04:50:43,400
I have said every single word. If you were dedicated

2192
04:50:43,400 --> 04:50:47,400
enough, you could make an entire audiobook

2193
04:50:47,400 --> 04:50:51,400
of me saying anything you wanted over the course of like

2194
04:50:51,400 --> 04:50:57,220
four or five hundred pages. You could make anything.

2195
04:50:57,220 --> 04:51:01,220
And you could write a whole book and have me be the narrator

2196
04:51:01,220 --> 04:51:11,860
with different clips. You could just make an AI to view your videos and recreate

2197
04:51:11,860 --> 04:51:19,479
you in your entirety.

2198
04:51:19,479 --> 04:51:23,479
I haven't said every word.

2199
04:51:23,479 --> 04:51:46,259
Relax. I see my name. Time to watch every

2200
04:51:46,259 --> 04:51:52,869
Jerma stream and make sure he's said every single word.

2201
04:51:52,869 --> 04:52:12,790
Streamer lies. Jiggle it a little. It'll open.

2202
04:52:12,790 --> 04:52:19,700
Oh my god. I've never swore on stream.

2203
04:52:19,700 --> 04:52:24,709
Yes, I have. I think I swore every like eight minutes

2204
04:52:24,709 --> 04:52:36,119
today. You've never said... No, I'm not saying

2205
04:52:36,119 --> 04:52:43,669
words. But the next time I see you guys will be

2206
04:52:43,669 --> 04:52:47,909
on Wednesday. Have a nice relaxing start to your week.

2207
04:52:47,909 --> 04:52:51,909
Thank you for joining me on the VR stuff last couple of days. And we did VR

2208
04:52:51,909 --> 04:53:00,380
three days ago too, right? Four days ago? Thanks everybody again

2209
04:53:00,380 --> 04:53:06,470
for hanging out. Hope you have a good time. Take care everybody.

2210
04:53:06,470 --> 04:53:10,470
And Nintendo PlayStation with $2.50 right at the end. Hey Jerma, can you say

2211
04:53:10,470 --> 04:53:14,470
like... No. I'm not gonna say the thing from...

2212
04:53:14,470 --> 04:53:18,470
I almost said Breaking Bad. No. What's that show with

2213
04:53:18,470 --> 04:53:23,740
the nerds? It's like a nerd show. Earth. It's called like

2214
04:53:23,740 --> 04:53:30,979
at the... We're at the Earth. The Big Bang.

2215
04:53:30,979 --> 04:53:34,979
Yeah. I don't want to say the Sheldon catchphrase.

2216
04:53:34,979 --> 04:53:43,860
But I'll see you guys soon. Take care. Have a nice one.

2217
04:53:43,860 --> 04:53:50,139
And goodbye. Eat your vegetables. And drink your fucking water.

2218
04:53:50,139 --> 04:54:12,659
Like I'm gonna go down water right now. See you later guys.
