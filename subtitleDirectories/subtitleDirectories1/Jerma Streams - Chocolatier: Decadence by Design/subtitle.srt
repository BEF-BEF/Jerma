1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:10,339
Hey, what's up? Hey, hey, what's going on guys? How you doing? Hey, hey, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap.

2
00:00:10,339 --> 00:00:16,780
Can you hear me? Is this thing on? Tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, pep, pep, pep. Real voice. Wait, what

3
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:25,800
happened? I don't know why the GoXLR does this. Did I fix it? Hold on. Can you hear me? I sound

4
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:45,689
fucked up. I do? That's good. All right. Let me, hold on a second. Why are you linking a clip

5
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:53,670
of you thinking that I farted on stream once like two years ago or like a year ago or something?

6
00:00:54,310 --> 00:01:02,020
Why even link that? I have never farted on stream. See, a lot of you guys probably don't

7
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:09,209
understand this, but streamers have direct access to be able to control when you can and cannot hear

8
00:01:09,209 --> 00:01:17,109
them. Most streamers have a button that they can just press and it just mutes the microphone.

9
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:25,980
Now, I've never farted on stream, but I farted during the stream hundreds of times. I just

10
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:32,859
mute the microphone and just let it go. You don't even know what happened. You have no idea.

11
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:38,780
I'm just like, okay, here comes one. Mute. I could sit there for 10 seconds and just fart a burp and

12
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:46,170
shit and then come back and you did not even know that I left. Guys, I've taken entire phone calls

13
00:01:47,659 --> 00:01:52,950
while muted during cut scene before. Like, oh shit, I gotta make, I gotta make a quick phone call.

14
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:59,579
Mute. Oh, we're in a cut scene. Who cares? And then right when the cut scene's over, I gotta go,

15
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:14,259
I gotta go, gotta go. Bye. Whoa, un-mute. Whoa, cool cut scene, guys. I'm sorry. He hates us.

16
00:02:17,699 --> 00:02:25,189
Sorry, I wasn't live yesterday. I'm on a new medicine and the medicine is a very common medicine,

17
00:02:25,189 --> 00:02:31,110
but I got some annoying side effects. It's a stomach medicine and it made me kind of feel like

18
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:36,139
shit. I started taking it like two days ago. So we're going to take it easy today.

19
00:02:36,939 --> 00:02:43,370
I'll acclimate to the new medicine. This stream's going to be probably pretty short,

20
00:02:44,009 --> 00:02:50,280
maybe a few hours, maybe. I'm just going to chill. And in the recommended channel,

21
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,150
there was a game that was highly recommended. It's a game where you make your own chocolates

22
00:02:56,150 --> 00:03:01,289
and you have your own chocolate company. So that's exactly what we're going to do.

23
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:08,169
Tomorrow, we're going to play Connect and we're going to play Connect the day after that too.

24
00:03:08,169 --> 00:03:13,590
I mean, how am I going to, am I not going to play Connectibles? I've had that sitting there

25
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:19,000
for like a year, more than that. I have so much Connect that I, this is like still,

26
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:27,900
there's probably like 10 plus Connect games to play. When are you going to play Boom Blocks?

27
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:35,340
I don't, I don't know. Can we go back to the Wii eventually? What about GTA RP? Yeah, I,

28
00:03:36,699 --> 00:03:42,139
I just haven't had time to do it. I haven't had time to like get into it and like apply and sign

29
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:46,939
up. The, the archeology stream is taken up most of the time and another one, two other streams

30
00:03:46,939 --> 00:03:52,169
actually. We're going to, we're going to go bang, bang, bang, bang with streams here

31
00:03:53,340 --> 00:04:02,310
over the next few months. The archeology stream is going to be a lot of fun. I can't wait.

32
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:05,270
I can't wait. I don't, I'm not going to, I don't want to talk about it that much because it's like,

33
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:16,279
you'll see, just March 6th, you'll see, it's going to be fun. And no, there's no Catboy stream.

34
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:29,399
That's not, Catboy is not one of them. Catboy is not one of them. Why? Well, because I'm not,

35
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:34,360
I want to get that ready. I'm not just putting the ears on. I'm not putting the ears on and going

36
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:40,920
like, that's not going to happen. I mean, I probably, I probably will do that as a joke.

37
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:54,139
That what I just did. No, there's a lot going to just, just wait, just wait and see.

38
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:01,079
That stream is going to be a lot different than maybe you think it is.

39
00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:14,180
You're going to be a Catboy tryhard. Yeah. Yes. What are you going to do? You're just going to

40
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:20,420
have to watch. If I, I don't want to tell you what happens on the TV show before the TV show comes

41
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:33,509
out. I'm not, by the way, I'm not going to be on a TV show. All right. This is, this is, this game

42
00:05:33,509 --> 00:05:41,509
is going to be probably awesome or horrible. It depends on which one. I am hoping that this is,

43
00:05:42,149 --> 00:05:49,430
from the looks of it, we get to design our own chocolates and own lattes. I can't wait. It's

44
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:57,980
going to be fucking awesome. Do you have a play? Well, that you, that, that word,

45
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:04,060
that word should be banned in this chat. No. All right. Here we go. We're going to,

46
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:08,139
this is called chocolatier decadence by design. And apparently there are like four of these.

47
00:06:08,939 --> 00:06:19,079
Is the, my webcam on pointing at me? I hope not. Let's cover it to make sure we're good.

48
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:38,149
And here at the olive garden, you can get two entrees for only 2.99. It's another olive garden

49
00:06:38,149 --> 00:06:46,329
game. Our soup, salad and breadsticks are talk of the town. Chocolatier decadence by design.

50
00:06:50,459 --> 00:06:54,459
All right. Hell, I thought that was dog food. I was like, how is this chocolate? Is it a can

51
00:06:54,459 --> 00:07:01,620
of dog food? All right. Welcome chocolatier. Welcome to the world of chocolatier. Generations

52
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:07,060
ago, confectioner Martin Pohlmeister founded the chocolate company that bears his name.

53
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:12,420
And for over a hundred years, the company has survived family squabbles, hostile competitors,

54
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:17,509
and economic ups and downs. Just like the olive garden. Today in the twin shadows of the great

55
00:07:17,509 --> 00:07:21,189
depression and world war two, the company's factories have been converted for the war effort

56
00:07:21,189 --> 00:07:28,810
or lie unused. And the disappearance of her husband, Sean has left Alex Tanguy Fletcher

57
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:45,829
unavailable to steer the company. Can you help them? And what, there was an intro? Okay. Oh yeah.

58
00:07:45,829 --> 00:07:52,779
Flash player is uninstalled. It doesn't exist anymore. Right. Okay. We'll just imagine you

59
00:07:52,779 --> 00:08:02,089
watched it. Oh shit. Can I play this game? Can I play this game? I don't think I can play this game.

60
00:08:02,089 --> 00:08:12,500
This game not going to work. Oh shit. Hold on. Please enter your name. Um, what should my name be?

61
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:17,639
Oh no. I hope it's not flash. It's it's I probably can't even play this. I probably can't even play

62
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:25,180
this game. Well, okay. Well, let's find out. Don't be so upset about it yet. All right. My name.

63
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:36,419
What's a chocolatier name? I don't know. Um, Angus Angus is not to me does not scream chocolatier.

64
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:43,740
Angus to me screams hamburger. Derma the chocolate boy. That's my name.

65
00:08:49,769 --> 00:08:59,740
Steve. That's a, that's my full name. The last no Angus. No, get off of that meme. For God's sakes.

66
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:16,440
You're driving us mad. All right. Wonka Angus con zilly zonka, silly wonka, silly, silly,

67
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:25,529
Willy Wonka. No, that's just Willy Wonka with a silly, silly Willy. I think I kind of like silly

68
00:09:25,529 --> 00:09:42,220
Willy. Silly, silly Willy Wonderful. That sounds like an old WWF character. I feel like that's,

69
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:46,620
I feel like that's the guy that came up with doink the clown sometimes. Silly Willy Wonderful

70
00:09:46,620 --> 00:10:03,179
was berserker. Silly Willy zonka. I hate that. No, I'm not doing zilly zonka. You can just add a Z

71
00:10:03,179 --> 00:10:16,059
and make it funny. Keep it silly Willy zonka. I hate that. Yes, you can. It does make it funny.

72
00:10:16,059 --> 00:10:23,769
Watch me. Silly Willy zonka. How about silly zonka? Yeah. Silly zonka is better than Willy

73
00:10:23,769 --> 00:10:35,299
Wonka. Okay. Silly zonka. Silly zonka. Silly, silly zonka Wonka. Oh, perfect. That's like a

74
00:10:35,299 --> 00:10:46,340
good like copyright free version. Silly zonka Wonka. I don't care. Oh my God. I thought it

75
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:57,049
just didn't work. That car was just driving off the road. Did anybody see that? That car was just

76
00:10:57,049 --> 00:11:01,529
skidding out of control. That was like a Homer Simpson car. All right. We're supposed to chill.

77
00:11:02,169 --> 00:11:08,139
Look, look. Calm down. I'm supposed to relax. For most people, World War Two is... Why is this

78
00:11:08,139 --> 00:11:14,200
World War Two? For most people, World War Two is finally over. Not for me. Until my husband Sean

79
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:22,139
is accounted for. The war rages on. Wait, what? I won't mince words. Silly zonka Wonka. Bow master

80
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:27,960
confections is in shambles. And I simply can't focus on chocolate right now. I need someone else

81
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:41,559
to manage the company. Okay. You need to show me you can make chocolates and money.

82
00:11:41,559 --> 00:11:47,080
Once you have made at least $10,000, I'll make you CEO candidate and start introducing you to

83
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:55,940
the board of directors. That's not very much to be CEO. To make $10,000 for a conglomerate company,

84
00:11:55,940 --> 00:12:04,789
that's not to be the CEO. Oh, it's World War Two. How much is $10,000 in World War Two bucks?

85
00:12:04,789 --> 00:12:09,259
Like in World War Two dollars. Like with inflation and the change of the U.S. dollar

86
00:12:09,259 --> 00:12:19,799
and everything. And the yields, whatever that means. How much was $10,000 now? It's not billions

87
00:12:19,799 --> 00:12:28,629
of dollars. It's probably like 300 grand, maybe 200 grand. $145,000. That's okay. That's a lot

88
00:12:28,629 --> 00:12:35,370
of money. That's a lot of money. All right. So let's get started. Here are 100 sacks each of sugar

89
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:41,049
and cocoa. Go see Endrid over at Zurich Chocolate Works to turn these ingredients into chocolates.

90
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:49,269
You're just gonna hand them to me? Hey, Zilly Wonka. I've got 100 bags of sugar in the back

91
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:57,370
of the truck. Here you are. Here they are. Just dumped them on the ground. Introduce yourself to

92
00:12:57,370 --> 00:13:05,669
Endrid Rost over at Zurich Chocolate Works. Holy shit, these people are fucking crazy.

93
00:13:05,669 --> 00:13:09,909
These cars are freaking. Is this a one-way road? Is this a two-way road? Why are there

94
00:13:09,909 --> 00:13:20,659
cars parked over here? All right, where do I go? Zurich Chocolate Works. Okay, recipes,

95
00:13:20,659 --> 00:13:26,889
inventory, quest log, menu, awards. Oh, Swiss National Bank. Why? Okay, why do they? You buy

96
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:33,190
my own drugs and I click this. Main Street. Oh, Chocolate Works. I feel for what Alex is going

97
00:13:33,269 --> 00:13:40,330
through. Zilly. Why couldn't I just name my name like Adam? I feel for what Alex is going through,

98
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:45,740
silly Zonka Wonka. But boy, am I excited to get these machines working again. Click make chocolates

99
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:53,830
and make at least five cases of basic chocolate bars. Basic chocolate bars. Make at least five

100
00:13:53,830 --> 00:14:03,539
cases. Cases per week. You have 60 seconds to set our production rate. What? Aim and click to fire

101
00:14:03,539 --> 00:14:10,019
ingredients. Match the full tray you see on the right. I'll speed the machine up as you succeed

102
00:14:10,019 --> 00:14:16,919
and slow them down if you miss. Good luck. Why is this a fucking double dare exercise? What do

103
00:14:16,919 --> 00:14:29,909
I have to do? What am I? What am I doing? What's happened? Shoots out the window and like hits a

104
00:14:29,909 --> 00:14:38,779
fucking building next door. You hear like cat scream. Uh oh, wasted ingredient. Use the full

105
00:14:38,779 --> 00:14:44,629
tray on the right as your guide. I'll keep tracking each ingredient you waste up on the right. Waste

106
00:14:44,629 --> 00:14:53,690
eight and I'll be forced to halt production. Okay, there we go. Fuck, I got that wrong. What?

107
00:14:55,509 --> 00:15:05,129
Okay, coming up is next is oh my god. Okay, I don't understand how this works. These are all

108
00:15:05,129 --> 00:15:14,519
wrong. Okay, I have another almond. So the almond has to go over here. What the fuck is happening?

109
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:23,210
Okay, well I don't that one broke. Do I have to aim it into the slot? I have to just match this,

110
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:38,570
but I fail. The hit detection is fucking bizarre. What? I don't have any room for this. I got it.

111
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:50,460
Oh my god. Okay, I got six cases. Oh, what am I doing? As long as you have the needed ingredients

112
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:56,919
in stock, we'll keep making six cases a week. That's fucking stupid. I didn't know what the

113
00:15:56,919 --> 00:16:02,519
hell I was looking at. Try again. Okay, I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it.

114
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:12,120
The things are in the middle. Here we go. All right, snowball, almond. Wait, it doesn't matter.

115
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:16,440
It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. It literally doesn't matter. You just have to aim it at it.

116
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:39,269
Doesn't matter. Literally does not matter at all. Come on, get it. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

117
00:16:39,269 --> 00:16:50,279
Fuck. Wait, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.

118
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:57,299
Got it. Got it. Oh god. Oh my god, what do I do? All right, 13 cases. That's good. That's good. That's

119
00:16:57,299 --> 00:17:02,250
good. Oh wait, I thought I heard the fucking Flintstones thing. That means we went out.

120
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:11,269
I thought we were done. What the fuck is happening? I don't have any more ingredients.

121
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:24,779
Bill, slow down the production. 15 cases per week. All right. Your basic chocolate bars

122
00:17:24,779 --> 00:17:30,039
look delicious. All products and ingredients appear in your inventory. You can mouse over

123
00:17:30,039 --> 00:17:42,500
items for more information. Okay, 15 chocolate bar cases. 85 almonds and 85 snowballs. Okay,

124
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:49,609
15 cases in inventory. As you travel, you can track how many products we're making in the status

125
00:17:49,609 --> 00:17:55,500
window below. Inventory levels for each ingredient we're using are shown with color-coded bars. Green

126
00:17:55,500 --> 00:18:00,970
means we've got plenty. Yellow means we're running low, and red means production will soon be stalled.

127
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:07,690
So we always have to keep the snowballs and the almonds up. Speaking of ingredients, in order to

128
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:11,930
keep making basic chocolate bars, we'll need more sugar and cocoa soon. You're going to need some

129
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:23,539
money. Visit Near Deer Dorf Chocolates to turn your chocolates into cash. Welcome, silly Zonka

130
00:18:23,539 --> 00:18:31,019
Wonka. Step inside to review my prices. Why is this a cafeteria? Once inside, click sell all.

131
00:18:31,019 --> 00:18:37,900
I'll take your products and you'll get the cash. This sounds like I'm in the middle of Carr

132
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:48,809
and sorcery. This is people dumping gold coins on the counter. Here's what I'm willing to pay

133
00:18:48,809 --> 00:18:58,890
for your items. So $85. That's it? 15 cases of chocolate bars? That's fucking horrible.

00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:05,529
Oh shit, that's each. Okay, I got $1,200. Thank you for stopping by, silly Zonka Wonka. It is always

135
00:19:05,529 --> 00:19:09,609
my pleasure to offer the best prices for quality chocolates. Now go back and speak with Alex. You

136
00:19:09,609 --> 00:19:19,299
can find her at the Bandhof, the main rail station here in Zurich. Okay, is it hard H or soft H?

137
00:19:19,299 --> 00:19:31,700
Is it Zurich or Zurich? So it's Zurich. Zurich. Okay, so we're making chocolate though.

138
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:36,170
We're making 15 chocolate bars per week. We have enough ingredients for five weeks.

139
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:50,789
It is currently July 4th. Wait, we're out in America. Never mind. I'm sorry. We're out in

140
00:19:50,789 --> 00:20:00,700
America. All right, where are we going? The rail station. I was going to say, where's the fireworks?

141
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:10,740
At the Bandhof. University, Bandhof. Well done, Alex, Adam, whatever. You've made some chocolates

142
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:14,339
and you've made some money. With the factory now operational, I suspect you'll be needing

143
00:20:14,339 --> 00:20:18,490
ingredients soon. It's time to restock your inventory of cocoa and sugar. I'm going to give

144

156
00:22:24,819 --> 00:22:30,099

00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:38,650
Where's my inventory? I fucking told you I had already had like 100. Why is everybody yelling at

164
00:23:34,569 --> 00:23:41,339

165
00:23:41,339 --> 00:23:46,740
She truly believes she'll be able to find her husband. You have to admire her spirit though.

166
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:53,740
Okay. Okay. Look at all this inventory I got. Okay. Travel back. This is a I don't want to run

168
00:24:05,369 --> 00:24:09,130
wonka which is good because I need to leave soon. Next make your way back over to Main Street

169
00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:13,130
Market. Verena has a new ingredient you can use to make a new recipe. Something that's always

170
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:20,200
good for business. Word travels fast. I assume you're here to purchase some of my milk which

171
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:25,619
just arrived. As soon as you have milk, sugar, and Kakao in your inventory visit the factory here in

172
00:24:25,619 --> 00:24:36,339
Zurich to make a new recipe. Milk chocolate bars. How much milk should I have? Should I buy like 100

173
00:24:36,339 --> 00:24:43,049
milks? All right. I'm gonna buy one. Well I don't have that much money. How many milks should I

174
00:24:43,049 --> 00:25:00,519
make? 25? 25 milks. All right. Let's go to the factory. Okay. Here we go. Click change recipes

175
00:25:00,519 --> 00:25:04,440
select milk chocolate bars and make as many as you can. More complicated recipes mean higher

176
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:19,900
profits. Keep trying until you set production to at least 10 cases. Change recipe. Oh shit. Creations?

177
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:23,099
You do not currently have any space available in the recipe for your own creations but I can make

178
00:25:23,099 --> 00:25:33,769
my own chocolate. All right. Here we go. Milk chocolate bars. Silky milk chocolate slightly

179
00:25:33,769 --> 00:25:40,329
sweeter than our dark chocolate offerings. Okay. Use this one. Oh god fucking damn it. I hate this.

191
00:27:46,549 --> 00:27:52,980
How much can I afford? I can't go anywhere though. All right we're good. That's fine. That's fine.

192
00:27:52,980 --> 00:28:05,880

193
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:10,950
game's kind of fun. How delightful. I'm going to take 10 cases of your milk chocolate bars and

194
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:18,069
give you three thousand dollars as well as 200 sacks of caramel in return. I want you to go back

195
00:28:18,069 --> 00:28:22,789
and see Endric Rast. As long as you have caramel sugar and cacao in stock you'll be able to make

196
00:28:22,789 --> 00:28:27,660
chocolate bars with caramel. And I hear that Endric has a new gizmo at the factory that he's

eager to show you. Okay I have enough. Okay let's go. You have on hand everything we need to make

00:28:50,859 --> 00:28:54,940

I'll never be as fast as you want me to be. I promise. This is as fast as I'll ever be.

207
00:29:58,779 --> 00:30:06,950
I will never be faster than this. I promise. I guarantee you. So many people right now I just

Whoops. Shit. All right he slowed it down. It's all right. All right. 17 fucking cases a week.

211
00:30:34,779 --> 00:30:41,289
Yeah I it takes me I have to it takes me time to process info. If I need to like if I need to add

212
00:30:41,289 --> 00:30:55,829
I still count with my fingers. I do and I know a lot of you do too. Very cool. You now know how

213
00:30:55,829 --> 00:31:00,789
to make three chocolate recipes. You can travel buy ingredients and sell your products as a profit.

214
00:31:00,789 --> 00:31:05,180
Once you've built your cash on hand to at least 10 grand Alex will be ready to hand you the reins

215
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:16,809
of the company. Good luck. Right. All right. Who wants to. What do I got. I have 18 cases of

218
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:32,140
in your inventory your factory will crank out chocolates as you travel. I heard that Alex will

219
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:46,410
be ready to make a move soon as you have 10,000. Oh boy this is over. 449 a case.

220
00:31:51,000 --> 00:32:00,299
It's a grid. All right. I get the factory now. Let's sell it all. Fuck it. How many do I have.

223
00:32:28,119 --> 00:32:34,200
Sell all. Oh well I wanted to check. Silly zonka wonka you've done it. You've shown your prowess

224
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:39,400
at making chocolates and making money. Now we simply must go. Ready or not the company's in

225
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:46,309
your hands as I promised you are now the official CEO candidate of Baumeister confections. There are

226
00:32:46,309 --> 00:32:50,230
five other members of the Baumeister conventions board of directors. You're going to need to work

227
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:55,029
with them each of them one by one to convince them that you are capable of being our CEO.

228
00:32:55,029 --> 00:32:59,750
Some you find easier to work within others but they are all good people. Why are you speaking

229
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:09,380
like in like second person for me. It's weird. I am off to launch my search for Sean. I'll be in

230
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:17,339
like why is she reading a novel through my head. I'll be in touch as I can and you should and

231
00:33:17,339 --> 00:33:23,740
you should also keep an eye out on your travels for my assistant Rick Lafontaine. If necessary

232
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:32,299
the rest of the board and I will be able to get messages to you through Rick. Right now you need

233
00:33:32,299 --> 00:33:37,579
to go see my uncle Felix Baumeister in Cape Town. I think he's the best board member to begin with.

234
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:42,359
Also I understand that he's been working on some secret projects that may have a significant

235
00:33:42,359 --> 00:33:49,289
impact on our business. I know you can do it silly Zonka Wonka. Good luck. All right we're making

236
00:33:49,930 --> 00:33:57,880
wait is it we're spending 2500 bucks a week. Is that how much I'm making. I'm confused. All right

237
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:13,369
quest log. You're ready. Talk to Felix. Here we go. 447 bucks. I can't wait. I'm gonna sell the

238
00:34:13,369 --> 00:34:25,460
hell out of this. All right talk to Felix. Where are we? If you're trying to find Felix head over

239
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:39,420
to Cape Town manufacturing. They sell. Oh my god sell all. About 21 000 dollars. Welcome to South

240
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:44,539
Africa silly Wonka Zonka. I'm hopeful that you will indeed be able to steer our company through

241
00:34:44,539 --> 00:34:50,900
these rough modern waters. While the war was raging I've been experimenting here with this

242
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:55,449
old chocolate factory. You see I love chocolate as much as the next guy but my latest passion is

243
00:34:55,449 --> 00:35:00,070
coffee. It's my personal belief that coffee and coffee products represent a new frontier for our

244
00:35:00,070 --> 00:35:05,699
company. I just need a bit more time to iron out the kinks of these coffee machines. You need to

245
00:35:05,699 --> 00:35:09,219
keep expanding your repertoire of chocolate offerings and building up your business while

246
00:35:09,219 --> 00:35:14,579
making coffee. In the meantime would you do something for me? Grab some peanuts from the

247
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:18,809
market here in Cape Town. Make 20 cases of chocolate bars with peanuts and deliver them

248
00:35:18,809 --> 00:35:33,000
to Florian Amiel at University of Zurich. 20. Okay I can eat. I eat peanuts. I will. Look at

249
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:38,920
peanuts. Almonds. Holy shit peanuts are so expensive. What does it take to. I don't have

250
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:55,579
to. Wait haggle. Wait how do I get out? I can't leave? Okay wait there we go. Where are my recipes?

251
00:35:55,579 --> 00:36:08,679
Chocolate bars with peanuts. Okay so it's sugar. There's no milk. That's good. So I just need. I

252
00:36:08,679 --> 00:36:17,139
need like 100 sacks. All right I need 100. No I don't. I need like how many do you want? 10 cases?

253
00:36:17,139 --> 00:36:30,570
20 cases. I need 20. I need 20 cases. 20 sacks. Let's haggle. Haggle. Did you have something to

254
00:36:30,570 --> 00:36:35,739
chat about? Are you joking? These prices are insane. I'm not asking for lots but I want

255
00:36:35,739 --> 00:36:40,440
you to do something about your prices. Is it me or are your prices way out of line compared to

256
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:44,360
other places? I'm gonna buy from you. I'm just hoping you might be able to help a tad with your

257
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:55,159
prices. Imagine walking into a place. Is it me or are you. What do you mean is it you? Are you talking

258
00:36:55,159 --> 00:37:02,579
to a bunch of people in the market? Trying to get everybody on board? Is it just me or are these

259
00:37:02,579 --> 00:37:06,659
prices out of line compared to other places? Waiting for someone to be like yeah it is a little

260
00:37:06,659 --> 00:37:16,500
expensive. It is a little expensive isn't it? Got it. Since I'm in such a good mood today I'll cut

261
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:23,079
you a deal. That's a pretty good deal. Last seen in Cape Town for 86 per sack. Let's, we need,

262
00:37:23,079 --> 00:37:29,699
I should buy a shitload of them then if I got a deal. Should I just buy $15,000 worth of peanuts?

263
00:37:29,699 --> 00:37:42,199
They don't go bad do they? Wait can I just take these and sell them? Ow that hurt. Can I just

264
00:37:42,199 --> 00:37:49,989
take these and sell them in a different like country? Could I immediately get 80 like $5?

265
00:37:51,099 --> 00:38:06,230
Haggle more. Okay you're nuts if you think I'll buy anything at these prices and I like look

266
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:13,289
around and I like wink at everybody because I'm buying peanuts. He didn't like that okay.

267
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:22,679
All right all right all right fine fine fine. Okay let's do 50. No I could afford 100.

268
00:38:23,239 --> 00:38:26,760
Let's just, I'll do 100. That's a lot of money. It's a big investment.

269
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:38,739
Okay bring 20 cases of chocolate bars with peanuts. So we have the ingredients. Anything else I can

270
00:38:38,739 --> 00:38:47,239
do here? Now that you're CEO candidate you'll be able to haggle at shops and markets. Be careful

271
00:38:47,239 --> 00:38:51,239
though. If you say the right thing haggling can result in better prices but you can also insult

272
00:38:51,239 --> 00:39:00,699
merchants and cause their prices to move the wrong way too. All right all right we don't want to

273
00:39:00,699 --> 00:39:09,289
spend too much money. Let's go back. Let's make the chocolate with peanuts and make 100 million

274
00:39:09,289 --> 00:39:20,820
dollars. I can sell these too. Penis is expensive. What are you talking about? All right let's make

275
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:28,789

276
00:39:29,610 --> 00:39:36,969
Wait hey hey can I have that back? Give me that back please. I'd like a refund.

277
00:39:37,849 --> 00:39:42,889
Oh you'd like to return? You'd like a refund? Yeah I'd like to. Let's cancel that transaction please.

278
00:39:42,889 --> 00:39:46,739
Hey can we do it again? But I'd love to do business with you. Your prices are ridiculous.

279
00:39:46,739 --> 00:39:54,099
God damn it. All right how do I make the peanuts? This is what they're making right now. Change that

283
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:53,190
He's speeding up. Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck. More more more more more more more more.

284
00:40:54,070 --> 00:41:06,380
More more. Oh fuck I keep thinking that's the end. Imagine like a guy in a factory

285
00:41:07,179 --> 00:41:18,019
sitting there screaming that. It's like we can only go so fast. More more more.

286
00:41:18,739 --> 00:41:31,340
More. He's on a PA system too. He's not even he's not even down there. He's up with the glass wall

287
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:54,980
looking down. That guy's a fucking asshole. Does he know that these machines are automated?

288
00:41:55,619 --> 00:42:00,300
Like which maintaining the machines we're making sure everything works you know.

289
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:06,570
We can only set it to go at a certain speed. What does he think we're doing?

290
00:42:06,570 --> 00:42:20,340
18 a week. We need more. We need more gas. All right I'm gonna get 18. How many? I need 20k. Ah shit.

291
00:42:20,599 --> 00:42:31,210
Whatever. Enough ingredients for four weeks. He starts like playing like the Pee Wee Herman music

292
00:42:31,210 --> 00:42:37,980
for the PA. And it's like oh this guy this guy doesn't fucking get it. That's gonna come through

293
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:59,019
really like garbled and shitty. Like this guy's doing the shit like that. Like the fucking

294
00:42:59,019 --> 00:43:09,260
grandfather would do that. You like this song? He leans in to do that. He's the one doing that

295
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:28,460
with his mouth. Oh doy doy doy. Why? All right I gotta wait. Can I do anything else in the meantime?

296
00:43:29,019 --> 00:43:42,539
I have oh with peanuts. I have eight. That's it? What week is it? What day is it? How many do I have?

299
00:44:11,659 --> 00:44:16,219
My dear friend Felix Baumeister told me to expect something sweet. Do you have any idea what he might

300
00:44:16,219 --> 00:44:23,210
have been talking about? I have chocolate all over my mouth. An empty container of chocolates.

301
00:44:23,210 --> 00:44:30,599
And I go I don't know what I don't know. Here's a card that he sent you. It's like that's classic

302
00:44:30,599 --> 00:44:42,519
classic like Looney Tunes humor. Sus. It is not it's not even fucking close okay. It's a guy

303
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:54,699
smiling. It's a guy smiling. It's not even close. I think I need to how do I make time go by? Can I?

304
00:44:54,699 --> 00:45:06,360
Do I just travel somewhere and buy some more stuff? I don't really want to take I don't okay

305
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:15,320
I don't want to take an airplane to a different continent so a day can go by. Is there can I not

310
00:46:23,429 --> 00:46:38,619

311
00:46:38,619 --> 00:46:58,070
fast my brain can work or something right? Okay we get 16 cases. He's sucking for his teeth.

312
00:46:58,150 --> 00:47:07,099
18 cases. There it is. I now have 36. I need more peanuts. Let's go to the university.

313
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:12,300
You've made my day simply zonkawonka. Do you know how hard it was to get a hold of peanuts during

314
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:17,380
the war? These chocolates are simply delightful. Did I know you didn't give me any money? Do

315
00:47:17,380 --> 00:47:21,219
yourself a favor. Take another 30 cases of these delightful chocolate bars of peanuts

316
00:47:21,219 --> 00:47:28,739
to Duduzail Nikosi in Cape Town. You can find her up on the Table Mountain. I know she'll love

317
00:47:28,739 --> 00:47:40,579
the chocolates and she's usually up on the latest news. How many how many do I have? How many do I

318
00:47:40,579 --> 00:47:49,880
have? Oh I need more. I don't have enough peanuts. You're just this is a front for you smuggling

319
00:47:49,880 --> 00:48:01,159
drugs. Okay I can I can I'm gonna do the chocolate. I can do this again. Fuck. Wait no I don't. I can

320
00:48:01,159 --> 00:48:06,869
make 18 a week. Me flying takes how many weeks? Wait it doesn't take weeks to fly? Yes it does.

321
00:48:06,869 --> 00:48:22,409
Why? This trip will take you spend a week in an airplane teleportation. This is the 1940s. Oh

322
00:48:26,329 --> 00:48:33,769
I yeah that would take a while. It's 1940. Yeah okay I don't know why I figured it was like today.

323
00:48:33,769 --> 00:48:37,900
They had planes. Yeah they had planes but the planes had like I don't know the planes have

324
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:42,150
the same technology that has the whirly thing on the top of the comedy hat. It's like the same

325
00:48:42,150 --> 00:48:57,929
technology they had. All right where is this? Cape Town. Okay so I should get more chocolate right?

326
00:48:57,929 --> 00:49:07,059
34. Table Mountain. Delicious. Listen I understand that Verena Zubriggen has been stalking all kinds

327
00:49:07,059 --> 00:49:17,050
of new ingredients. I imagine you may just find some new useful things on your next visit. I just

328
00:49:17,050 --> 00:49:28,219
got a tip and I didn't even fucking pay attention. I just that's so much that I just that was like

329
00:49:28,219 --> 00:49:37,530
ten twenty thousand dollars. What did they just say? What did they what did they just say? I just

330
00:49:37,530 --> 00:49:42,579
was staring at that person with my mouth open and they told me something very important that I just

331
00:49:42,579 --> 00:49:48,260
got back on the plane. I wasn't even paying attention. What was it? I wasn't paying attention

332
00:49:48,260 --> 00:50:03,369
either. What did what what did the game just say? Nobody had to have been paying attention to what

333
00:50:03,369 --> 00:50:17,130
the game said. I was tabbed out. What? Tab back in and help. Go to the factory. This the factory here?

334
00:50:17,130 --> 00:50:29,349
Oh oh no it said buy ingredients. Hold on wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait

335
00:50:29,349 --> 00:50:33,699
wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait. You're just the person I've been looking for. I

336
00:50:33,699 --> 00:50:39,449
happen to have a glut of sugar. I'm trying to offload. I'd be willing to exchange a thousand

337
00:50:39,449 --> 00:50:45,500
sacks of sugar for a mere 18 cases of chocolate bars with mint. Does that make a deal? Let's make

338
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:56,250
a deal. Oh I have to buy the mint from you. Oh I see but this is so I have to like just buy mint

339
00:50:56,250 --> 00:51:02,619
from you and come back and and you give me all your sugar. What you meant to say is you have a

340
00:51:02,619 --> 00:51:08,940
glut of mint and you don't care about the sugar because it's so cheap. So you're going to mind

341
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:13,989
game me into buying a shitload of the expensive herb from you to then think that I'm going to

342
00:51:13,989 --> 00:51:19,900
come back and get a lot of the cheap thing that you don't care about. Well uh do I look like a

343
00:51:19,900 --> 00:51:32,519
fool? He wants 18 cases. Well I think we can make some money with this so I'm going to get 30 cases.

344
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:45,940
No more than that. Let's make some mint. 50 cases. No enough for two weeks and I'm usually around

345
00:51:45,940 --> 00:51:56,329
18 15 to 18. Let's just say like 40 cases. Okay how much sugar do I have? While I'm here I might

346
00:51:56,329 --> 00:52:13,179
as well get some milk. Last seen 32 to 42 89 to 111. That's no that's expensive. Hazelnuts 152

347
00:52:13,179 --> 00:52:24,199
in Cape Town. So what's going on here? That's good for milk. I'm gonna get 100. No no no no no no no

348
00:52:24,199 --> 00:52:35,400
I'm gonna get fucking 500. Is that too much? 300. Is that too much? 200 is probably 200.

349
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:45,320
And how much? All right I'm good I'm good I'm good. Let's go back and get the recipe for the mint.

350
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:59,139
Come back and get a thousand. This is running out. What the hell is this? This is a guy on the plane

351
00:52:59,139 --> 00:53:04,969
sitting next to me. Agiling is tricky but buying low and selling high is the secret to success and

352
00:53:04,969 --> 00:53:19,079
the confections business. Silly zonkawonga. Thank you. Why is that guy like slug-worthing me? Get

353
00:53:19,079 --> 00:53:22,679
out of here. I don't care about you. You're like weird. He's gonna tempt me with something later.

354
00:53:22,679 --> 00:53:27,989
He's gonna be like let me tell you something. How about you sell it to me? Sell the company to me

355
00:53:27,989 --> 00:53:39,800
CEO. All right 18 cases need uh chocolate works. Change the recipe. Mint. Ooh refreshing and

357
00:53:45,159 --> 00:54:15,139

358
00:54:15,139 --> 00:54:37,019
get the hang of this. Stop talking. Come on come on come on come on come on come on. Come on you can

359
00:54:37,019 --> 00:54:55,340
do better than that. You can do better than that. God damn it. Missed. All right that's that's that's

00:54:55,340 --> 00:55:05,940

361
00:55:05,940 --> 00:55:14,699

362
00:55:14,699 --> 00:55:24,309

365
00:55:43,349 --> 00:55:48,940
halt for a little bit but let's go. One of your factories is stalled. You need to have enough

366
00:55:48,940 --> 00:55:52,300
ingredients on hand to keep the machinery running while you travel so they can continue to produce

367
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:56,300
chocolates for you to sell. Throw your mouse over the factory status window below to find out where

368
00:55:56,300 --> 00:56:05,940
to buy the ingredients you need. Ooh I got a trophy. Chocolate Historical Society's up and cum

369
00:56:05,940 --> 00:56:11,619
cummer cup. Presented to a budding chocolatier who has arrived with a big splash on the chocolate

370
00:56:11,619 --> 00:56:18,380
making scene. Oh thanks. All right here we go. Horrific these chocolate bars are mint are perfect.

371
00:56:18,380 --> 00:56:28,659
Here are a thousand sacks of sugar and mint is cheaper now. You dick. Because I bought it all.

372
00:56:29,380 --> 00:56:40,840
He's dumped it all on me. Should I make some more mint? I'm going full on. Give me a better deer or

373
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:50,650
I'm gonna walk away. I am not so easily swayed. Um you simply need to do something for me now or

374
00:56:50,650 --> 00:56:55,190
no no no he didn't like that. Times are tough but they are tough for everyone myself included. If

375
00:56:55,190 --> 00:57:02,739
you're you're nuts. I heard good things about this place. Hey if you don't like the prices you're

376
00:57:02,739 --> 00:57:22,469
welcome to take your business elsewhere. You're joking they're insane. Okay go visit Felix

377
00:57:22,469 --> 00:57:27,429
Baumeister in Cape Town. He has something exciting to share. Oh thanks it's okay he went back to

378
00:57:27,429 --> 00:57:37,909
normal. He needs some evidence of your creative ability. We've been building a secret test kitchen

379
00:57:37,909 --> 00:57:45,849
in Iceland. Far away from the watchful eyes of our competitors. This is where you will have the

380
00:57:45,849 --> 00:57:51,050
chance to invent your own recipes to bring to market. Go to Iceland now. My nephew Teddy will

381
00:57:51,050 --> 00:57:56,170
welcome you. Grab one sack of whatever ingredients you're carrying and I'll explain more. Hold on so

382
00:57:56,170 --> 00:58:07,619

383
00:58:07,699 --> 00:58:15,659
What do I have? I gotta sell some chocolate bars first of all. Who can I sell to? Here we go only

00:58:15,659 --> 00:58:33,110
232. That's it? Nobody likes mint. I need money. No do I need to haggle? Uh I don't mean to tell you

385
00:58:33,110 --> 00:58:39,099
how to run your business but your price is not reasonable. Uh your prices seem very close to

386
00:58:39,099 --> 00:58:44,900
good. Are they totally firm here? I am not really in the mood to haggle. Okay well here just have

why would i put coconut in this go oh shit okay here we go this is cuban cayenne honey at base

924
02:51:44,950 --> 02:51:53,129
is going to be a dark cream a nice dark cuban coffee color like that with the richness falling

02:52:58,620 --> 02:53:04,309
sprinkled on top of the cuban coffee with a drizzle of honey on top to negate some of the

932
