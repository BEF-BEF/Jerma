1
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:19,980
Hey. I'm strapped in. I can't get out now. My arms are tied to the chairs. My back is tied to

2
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:33,130
the back of the chair and I have to beat Sekiro today. No. Welcome guys. He's strapped in all

3
00:00:33,130 --> 00:01:27,340
right. I'll be right back. I forgot one thing. A tweet and a coffee. See you in a sec. I got

4
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:38,120
an LOL title. What's wrong with an LOL title every now and then? This is the worst thing.

5
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:46,069
Okay. I'm going to give you some insight on a streamer insight. Okay. So I just had to

6
00:01:46,069 --> 00:01:53,590
grab like two things. So I had to go up the stairs. Down the stairs. Auto. You good? Okay.

7
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:58,150
Auto's been up. Back up the stairs. And then I just sat here and I forgot that I'm like,

8
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:11,259
Hey guys, how are you? Hey, welcome to the broadcast. Somebody said, wouldn't you have

9
00:02:11,259 --> 00:02:15,419
finished any Dark Souls by now? Dark Souls 3 took me like four or five streams, didn't it?

10
00:02:16,139 --> 00:02:21,770
And this game is harder than Dark Souls in my opinion. I think it's more difficult

11
00:02:22,569 --> 00:02:33,379
than any of the Dark Souls games. Somebody said, no, you're bad. I beat Owl first try

12
00:02:33,379 --> 00:02:38,389
and I beat Double Gorilla first try, but I'm terrible at the game though. You know,

13
00:02:38,389 --> 00:02:42,949
just awful. I mean, he's just terrible at this game. Everything about he's terrible at the game.

14
00:02:43,590 --> 00:03:01,240
I mean, he's just so bad. I can't even understand how awful he is. The Double Gorilla

15
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:04,360
where you fight two Gorillas at the same time. One of them has that and he beat it first try.

16
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:08,280
I mean, he's so awful at games like this. I just can't, I, I, I can't even watch him.

17
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:44,330
Yeah. I give it a rest. Never. No, I, uh, I just, if you're just joining us for the first

18
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:49,800
time and you haven't seen Sekiro ever, uh, I'm going to tell you just, I'll leave now

19
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:58,469
because we're going to talk about major things that just happened. Okay. Are you here?

20
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:06,810
Are we all good? All right. Uh, so I, that was your chance. I just killed my dad.

21
00:04:07,689 --> 00:04:10,229
This is in this room, but literally the last thing I did last night.

22
00:04:10,789 --> 00:04:25,139
I don't know what happens next. All I know is that people were in this room, right?

23
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:40,060
Yes. Okay. So I think I got to come down here. I don't have any seeds, right?

24
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:46,759
Shit. Well, I just made a choice to protect him, right?

25
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:04,699
This is the tree branch.

26
00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:26,970
Yes. That's right. Yeah. I killed my father for a stick. Yeah. I could have just gone outside

27
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:31,529
to any tree out there. I could have just, okay, I could have like sneezed over here

28
00:05:31,529 --> 00:05:34,970
and he was like, what was that? Could have walked over, grabbed a branch from here,

29
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:39,500
just snapped it off and been like heritage. And he would have been like, Oh, thanks.

30
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:47,209
What's so special about that branch? We don't have all the ingredients.

31
00:05:47,689 --> 00:05:49,290
That it is the mortal blade.

32
00:05:53,259 --> 00:05:57,579
Yes. It was given to me by the divine child of the rejuvenating waters.

33
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:59,579
Do we have all the ingredients?

34
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:07,740
The monks at Sempo temple abandoned the ways of their faith in pursuit of immortality.

35
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:11,259
The result is those who have false dragons heritage

36
00:06:11,259 --> 00:06:14,779
known as the divine children of the rejuvenating waters.

37
00:06:14,779 --> 00:06:22,500
A false dragon's heritage. I never would have thought. Wait, divine children?

38
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:27,319
Yes. Many were created, but one survived.

39
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:33,319
Further proof of the corruption this power brings to man with the mortal blade in hand.

40
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:39,319
I can now be made to bleed. We are one step closer to creating a fountainhead infant.

41
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:42,120
The ties of immortality must be severed.

42
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,000
Yes, my lord.

43
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:48,259
Okay. Well, you didn't really give me any more info.

44
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:53,379
I didn't really look at, let me look at the items too.

45
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:57,720
Cause I got, I got like two new things, right?

46
00:07:01,339 --> 00:07:02,540
Didn't I get like something to read?

47
00:07:03,259 --> 00:07:06,790
I'm trying to think of what the last thing we did was,

48
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:08,389
or the last piece of information here.

49
00:07:14,459 --> 00:07:17,610
What about you? You got anything for me?

50
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:24,420
I'm glad you've come, Master Wolf. It looks as if your brow is less fur.

51
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:27,300
Oh, right, right, right. I was going to kill the tutorial guy.

52
00:07:28,019 --> 00:07:37,879
Right. I was going to go kill Mr. Tutorial.

53
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:57,220
I could clear the essence as well. He's ready.

54
00:07:57,779 --> 00:08:07,980
You're certain of this?

55
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:10,949
Yes. I want you to kill me.

56
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:11,990
As you wish.

57
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:17,370
Go on.

58
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:20,009
How do I do it? Can I do it any way I want?

59
00:08:20,569 --> 00:08:23,050
Like can I get up there and drop a piano on him?

60
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:31,560
Oh no, he has to die by this sword, right?

61
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,559
Whoa, there's a centipede inside of him.

62
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:40,600
What? Oh, why the fuck does he have that inside of his body?

63
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:52,539
Oh, false tooth loaded with a secret shinobi drug.

64
00:08:52,539 --> 00:08:54,379
Blue in color can be used repeatedly.

65
00:08:55,740 --> 00:09:00,379
Crush the blue nostrum between the back teeth to die as often as one pleases.

66
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:08,870
What? All right, I'm just figuring out people that can't die have

67
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:11,750
the centipede worm inside them.

68
00:09:12,549 --> 00:09:15,379
That's fucked up.

69
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:18,330
That's a cyanide tooth.

70
00:09:18,889 --> 00:09:20,820
That's like some CIA shit.

71
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:26,500
Wait, do I have one of those inside of me?

72
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:29,259
I probably do.

73
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:32,230
Imagine figuring that out.

74
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:34,740
Imagine seeing that.

75
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,659
That's what makes people stay alive forever.

76
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:42,009
I would be like, how am I going to get a CT scan?

77
00:09:42,009 --> 00:09:42,809
Don't kill me yet.

78
00:09:42,809 --> 00:09:45,610
But just like, I just want to know if it's in there.

79
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:54,179
Well, that was, I got the tooth.

80
00:09:54,179 --> 00:09:56,090
How much money do I have?

81
00:09:56,649 --> 00:09:57,539
360.

82
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:00,919
I can't breathe.

83
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:06,759
All right, I got to, I'm going to cleanse the dragon rut.

84
00:10:06,759 --> 00:10:07,480
Let's just do it now.

85
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:21,990
Everyone's been healed.

86
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:28,149
All right, clean slate.

87
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:29,590
Good to go.

88
00:10:30,789 --> 00:10:31,750
Hey, I'm fine.

89
00:10:33,289 --> 00:10:40,340
Now I want to, I mean, he's got two of these, so I can always have at least one.

90
00:10:44,759 --> 00:10:45,480
What about pellets?

91
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,159
Maybe I should just buy a shitload of pellets.

92
00:10:50,009 --> 00:10:50,730
How many do I have?

93
00:10:53,159 --> 00:10:54,600
No, I have 24 of these.

94
00:10:56,279 --> 00:10:57,720
When did I get so many pellets?

95
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:01,529
I don't even remember getting this many.

96
00:11:01,529 --> 00:11:03,850
When did I get, oh yeah, I did go on like an item run, didn't I?

97
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:10,169
Are you going to try to kill headless today?

98
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:11,370
I don't even want to hear that name.

99
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:14,700
I don't even want to know that character exists.

100
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:17,100
It'll automatically make me upset.

101
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:22,470
In fact, I'm already mad now.

102
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:23,429
I don't even want to think about it.

103
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,039
I'm going to say we'll see.

104
00:11:34,059 --> 00:11:34,940
I'm just preparing.

105
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:37,419
I'm just getting, make sure I'm ready to play because we got this.

106
00:11:37,419 --> 00:11:41,179
We're in like the last, we're in like the final act of the game, I think.

107
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:45,659
From what happened last night, this has to be the final act.

108
00:11:45,659 --> 00:11:53,909
I still need, okay, what can I, what can I get?

109
00:11:54,629 --> 00:11:58,870
Let me see, sparkling, long spark.

110
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:05,029
Long spark and increased proportion of black eye over the effect can be prolonged

111
00:12:05,029 --> 00:12:05,750
in the average fire.

112
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:08,070
I like the firecrackers, purple fumes spark.

113
00:12:14,139 --> 00:12:14,860
Oh shit.

114
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:18,019
I want this, I want this so bad.

115
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:23,179
Oh man, I want this, I want this right now.

116
00:12:23,179 --> 00:12:24,620
How do I get this right now?

117
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:29,539
That's a lot of money.

118
00:12:30,259 --> 00:12:31,539
I'm going to, how much money do I have?

119
00:12:31,539 --> 00:12:32,259
Do I have any things?

120
00:12:32,899 --> 00:12:37,580
I don't think I have any of those pouches, do I?

121
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:38,940
I do.

122
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:40,460
Yeah, I have to, I'm buying it.

123
00:12:41,019 --> 00:12:44,340
What was it, six?

124
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:50,409
I use the firecrackers so much.

125
00:12:50,409 --> 00:12:51,450
It's like my favorite item.

126
00:12:52,009 --> 00:12:53,210
I might as well just do it.

127
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:54,250
If that's the thing I'm going to use.

128
00:12:55,210 --> 00:13:03,379
Because I have the materials to go from here to here.

129
00:13:09,879 --> 00:13:11,240
I need two.

130
00:13:12,679 --> 00:13:16,200
Okay, let's just start it.

131
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,000
What does this one do?

132
00:13:17,559 --> 00:13:21,159
Forcing enemies caught in the last turn around.

133
00:13:21,159 --> 00:13:22,840
This is the one that makes them turn around.

134
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:23,879
Okay, I can do it twice.

135
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:29,820
And then that leads me to here.

136
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:35,269
Oh my god, dude, do I have to go?

137
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:39,529
Do I have to get this as well?

138
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:46,070
Shit, this really is Monster Hunter.

139
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:47,190
God damn it.

140
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:48,549
I have to get all these?

141
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:50,389
Oh no.

142
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:53,110
All right, well, I have to get this.

143
00:14:05,559 --> 00:14:06,440
I need more money.

144
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:15,340
What was it, I didn't see it.

145
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:17,179
I think it was like 500 or 600.

146
00:14:26,389 --> 00:14:27,269
Just get more money.

147
00:14:27,269 --> 00:14:28,549
Well, at least I'm upgrading these.

148
00:14:29,269 --> 00:14:32,970
Okay, then that gives this to me.

149
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:35,769
I need 600 more, which leads to here.

150
00:14:35,769 --> 00:14:39,980
This is improve Sabumaru.

151
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:42,700
So let's just get, I have a little bit more money.

152
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:43,179
Let's do it.

153
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:52,090
Two, three, four, five.

154
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:52,649
God damn it.

155
00:14:53,210 --> 00:15:05,639
Hold on.

156
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,139
Play a different game?

157
00:15:14,139 --> 00:15:15,659
No, I have to, come on.

158
00:15:15,659 --> 00:15:16,779
Well, you want me to stop now?

159
00:15:21,419 --> 00:15:22,700
Imagine stopping now.

160
00:15:24,149 --> 00:15:28,059
All right, I'm going to sell like fucking four of these.

161
00:15:32,809 --> 00:15:35,049
Imagine playing this game to this point

162
00:15:35,049 --> 00:15:36,330
and then being like, well, that was fun.

163
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:37,850
First impressions, it's really hard.

164
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:38,409
It's really good.

165
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:40,519
That's it.

166
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,840
I'll see you next time.

167
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:47,340
Okay, so this brings me down here.

168
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:58,340
Okay, that, all right.

169
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:01,700
Okay, I am now ready to go from that in a straight line now.

170
00:16:03,929 --> 00:16:05,210
So I have improved stuff.

171
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:11,850
That's what you do with most games you stream.

172
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:17,610
Well, if a game has, I mean, it really depends, right?

173
00:16:18,409 --> 00:16:20,009
Okay, like a game like Kenshi, right?

174
00:16:20,009 --> 00:16:22,649
That's like a 200 hour game, right?

175
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:25,370
I'm not going to play that like 30 streams in a row.

176
00:16:26,009 --> 00:16:30,090
A game like Resident Evil 2, I'll play through the whole thing.

177
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:31,690
It's like a one and done kind of experience.

178
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:34,570
A game like this, it's just all the way through, one and done.

179
00:16:39,559 --> 00:16:44,120
Games that require like potentially 10 to 20 streams

180
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,120
to even get to the meat and potato of the game.

181
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:51,529
It's a lot different.

182
00:16:51,529 --> 00:16:53,940
Okay, so I have some better stuff.

183
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:54,820
Let's see.

184
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:55,620
That's already there.

185
00:16:56,340 --> 00:17:22,039
I think I'm ready to go.

186
00:17:23,369 --> 00:17:25,289
That was 50 bucks just came in right now.

187
00:17:26,009 --> 00:17:28,019
Who just gave 50 dollars?

188
00:17:29,559 --> 00:17:30,920
It was Fitty.

189
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:37,819
Thank you so much, Fitty, for the 50 dollars.

190
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:41,750
Hey, money.

191
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:42,630
They said, also, just so you know,

192
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:44,950
your chat's being monitored and recorded 24-7.

193
00:17:45,509 --> 00:17:46,740
This is the internet.

194
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:51,160
If you don't think that everything you've ever typed

195
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,240
in this chat could be pulled up somewhere.

196
00:17:53,319 --> 00:17:54,519
We're in 2019, man.

197
00:17:54,519 --> 00:17:55,079
It's the internet.

198
00:17:55,640 --> 00:18:02,900
You know what?

199
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:06,339
That's just the nature of where we are right now as humans.

200
00:18:12,859 --> 00:18:14,380
Hey, future people.

201
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:15,900
Chat is just learning this.

202
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:21,670
Yeah, so when you told me like two weeks ago

203
00:18:23,059 --> 00:18:24,740
to suck a fart out of your ass,

204
00:18:27,099 --> 00:18:28,859
somebody can just find you saying that.

205
00:18:29,819 --> 00:18:30,859
I hope everyone's aware of this.

206
00:18:34,299 --> 00:18:35,339
Like when you told chat

207
00:18:35,339 --> 00:18:37,019
that you ate a booger out of your nose

208
00:18:37,019 --> 00:18:38,539
and you liked how it tasted,

209
00:18:38,539 --> 00:18:39,579
and you were like, fuck, man.

210
00:18:39,579 --> 00:18:41,259
It's like weird, but I don't know why I like that.

211
00:18:42,299 --> 00:18:45,180
Five years from now, someone can look at that.

212
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:54,470
It's the internet, man.

213
00:18:55,029 --> 00:18:56,069
You got to be careful.

214
00:19:01,099 --> 00:19:02,700
He just admitted it on stream.

215
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:05,339
All right, where the fuck am I going?

216
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:09,859
I got, okay, I can dive.

217
00:19:10,579 --> 00:19:13,690
Where do I want to go?

218
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:28,299
I've said some pretty dopey stuff, to be honest.

219
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:30,259
Yeah, whatever, though.

220
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:35,740
It was like, your future employer

221
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:37,339
going to go to your Twitch chat log

222
00:19:37,339 --> 00:19:38,140
and see what you wrote.

223
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:45,269
It says here that, was your username ShitEater106?

224
00:19:48,599 --> 00:19:48,920
Yeah.

225
00:19:50,619 --> 00:19:53,819
But what about this one that's ShitEater107?

226
00:19:53,819 --> 00:19:55,900
108, 109, and 110.

227
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:58,059
Those are all tied to the same IP address.

228
00:19:58,059 --> 00:20:00,299
Is that also you?

229
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:02,230
Yep, it is.

230
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:06,490
Oh, any reason why you made five ShitEater usernames?

231
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:08,089
I'm just curious.

232
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:11,049
Well, you see, when I was 18,

233
00:20:12,069 --> 00:20:14,230
I was in this guy, Jerma985's chat,

234
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:16,569
and I got banned four times

235
00:20:16,569 --> 00:20:20,250
for writing I love eating shit in his chat.

236
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:22,250
And I got banned four times

237
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:24,890
over the course of six months.

238
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:27,930
So I just kept making new usernames

239
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:29,299
to say that again.

240
00:20:29,299 --> 00:20:31,380
And I would get removed again.

241
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:32,339
And then finally, I was removed

242
00:20:32,339 --> 00:20:33,460
from the whole website.

243
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:37,859
And, excuse me, what?

244
00:20:38,859 --> 00:20:42,539
I don't think we at Johnson & Johnson

245
00:20:42,539 --> 00:20:44,140
can have somebody like that around here.

246
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:45,099
You have to be careful, guys.

247
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:00,809
We here at Johnson & Johnson

248
00:21:00,809 --> 00:21:06,470
baby tier free shampoo formula company 107,

249
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:10,230
105 through, 100 through 106 got banned

250
00:21:10,789 --> 00:21:12,150
because we were putting formaldehyde

251
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:13,109
in baby shampoo.

252
00:21:13,109 --> 00:21:15,349
We got banned five times as a company.

253
00:21:15,349 --> 00:21:23,740
Let's go.

254
00:21:33,269 --> 00:21:34,789
You know too much.

255
00:21:38,619 --> 00:21:39,099
Yes.

256
00:21:39,099 --> 00:21:40,700
What am I just like fucking started

257
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:41,660
to slash it up?

258
00:21:45,349 --> 00:21:46,230
Use your eyes.

259
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:47,029
Is that what he just said?

260
00:21:55,099 --> 00:21:55,980
Use your eyes.

261
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:58,569
Is the wound I just made

262
00:21:58,569 --> 00:22:01,849
a small cut on my chest.

263
00:22:01,849 --> 00:22:06,980
So this an infant.

264
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:11,259
It's so extraordinarily nostalgic.

265
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:12,380
Yeah.

266
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:13,980
Like the new Ghostbusters movie,

267
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:15,180
Ghostbusters 3 coming up.

268
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:29,700
Okay.

269
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:37,670
A sweetly scented bridal offering

270
00:22:37,670 --> 00:22:39,109
that was written on the altar

271
00:22:39,109 --> 00:22:41,269
where the fragrant stone was placed.

272
00:22:41,269 --> 00:22:41,589
Yes.

273
00:22:42,309 --> 00:22:43,990
You now carry the aroma

274
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:46,069
of the Fountainhead incense.

275
00:22:46,069 --> 00:22:47,829
I believe the path leading

276
00:22:47,829 --> 00:22:49,349
to the Fountainhead palace

277
00:22:49,349 --> 00:22:50,950
will open before you.

278
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:53,430
If you go to the shrine within the cave,

279
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:55,589
immortality shall soon be severed.

280
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:57,349
A shrine and cave.

281
00:22:57,990 --> 00:22:58,630
As you wish.

282
00:23:00,069 --> 00:23:02,230
So the shrine, where was that?

283
00:23:03,109 --> 00:23:08,230
Am I drinking?

284
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:10,420
No, I got a coffee here.

285
00:23:12,299 --> 00:23:12,700
All right.

286
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:16,549
So that was, which one?

287
00:23:16,549 --> 00:23:17,430
I see a cave.

288
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:17,910
What was it?

289
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:18,789
Cave.

290
00:23:18,789 --> 00:23:20,390
I forget where it was.

291
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:21,589
Was that the misty place?

292
00:23:22,549 --> 00:23:33,380
That was here somewhere.

293
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:34,339
Wedding cave door.

294
00:23:36,410 --> 00:23:36,809
I think.

295
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:45,690
Somebody wrote egg.

296
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:49,460
Mod that guy for like 30 seconds.

297
00:23:55,450 --> 00:23:55,769
All right.

298
00:23:55,769 --> 00:23:57,690
I think this is obviously the place.

299
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:01,700
So go in this cave.

300
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:02,980
And now I smell like

301
00:24:03,779 --> 00:24:05,289
I have a certain scent to me.

302
00:24:05,289 --> 00:24:06,329
So now I'll be able to

303
00:24:08,089 --> 00:24:09,369
open the secret door.

304
00:24:13,779 --> 00:24:14,420
Maybe.

305
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:14,740
No.

306
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:17,720
Shelter stones.

307
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:18,759
Is this okay?

308
00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:23,819
Do I have to get on this?

309
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:32,299
Or do I maybe dive?

310
00:24:32,299 --> 00:24:33,420
Well, no.

311
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:36,140
This is, this is just a prayer outhouse.

312
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:38,920
Well, hold on.

313
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,119
Let me dive down here.

314
00:24:40,119 --> 00:24:40,680
Is there enough?

315
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:46,970
Is there a pool I can dive in?

316
00:24:47,529 --> 00:24:49,640
Is there?

317
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:50,279
There has to be.

318
00:24:50,279 --> 00:24:50,680
Come on.

319
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,359
This is like a standing water somewhere.

320
00:24:55,529 --> 00:24:55,769
Yeah.

321
00:24:55,769 --> 00:24:56,490
Diving in puddles.

322
00:24:56,490 --> 00:24:57,369
If I dive in a puddle,

323
00:24:57,369 --> 00:24:58,569
I'll just break my teeth.

324
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:04,819
No, there's no pool here.

325
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:06,839
I thought maybe there'd be like

326
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:08,200
a little pool back here or something.

327
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:08,359
All right.

328
00:25:08,359 --> 00:25:08,759
Let's go.

329
00:25:09,559 --> 00:25:12,789
Somebody said small break.

330
00:25:12,789 --> 00:25:13,829
I'm going to go in here.

331
00:25:18,339 --> 00:25:18,740
God.

332
00:25:19,670 --> 00:25:20,630
The impatience.

333
00:25:24,859 --> 00:25:26,460
The instant gratification.

334
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:27,579
Instant gratification.

335
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:30,180
I want to look around the trees.

336
00:25:31,079 --> 00:25:31,400
Okay.

337
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:35,660
Has it been a giant goat foot?

338
00:25:43,019 --> 00:25:44,940
It's not somebody's playing the claw game.

339
00:25:47,269 --> 00:25:47,910
I got it.

340
00:25:58,230 --> 00:25:59,029
Okay.

341
00:25:59,029 --> 00:26:00,069
This just got weird.

342
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:05,029
That's Mojo from Chrono Cross.

343
00:26:08,059 --> 00:26:09,180
Odd reference, I know.

344
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:09,660
But it is.

345
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:29,240
Where is he delivering me to?

346
00:26:30,279 --> 00:26:35,559
Uh, well, apparently he hasn't walked in a while.

347
00:26:36,359 --> 00:26:39,400
I severely overestimated.

348
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,319
I was lying down for too long.

349
00:26:41,319 --> 00:26:43,000
I have some sort of lactic acid built up.

350
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,039
I'll just let him go here.

351
00:26:44,039 --> 00:26:45,079
That's just, this is fine.

352
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:50,460
He ended with a dab.

353
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:51,339
Oh, don't say that.

354
00:26:58,470 --> 00:26:59,670
Your uber is here.

355
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:07,160
Oh, you guys.

356
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,039
Whoa, this is cool.

357
00:27:08,839 --> 00:27:19,930
I kind of would have liked to have

358
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:22,089
traveled a little bit longer on Mr.

359
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:28,140
Siercaro, just in case.

360
00:27:37,059 --> 00:27:38,019
That was fun.

361
00:27:38,019 --> 00:27:42,140
That's the coolest thing in the game so far.

362
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:43,819
I hope he gets up when he's, I have to fight him.

363
00:27:43,819 --> 00:27:44,859
Please let me fight this guy.

364
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:52,279
Hey, what was it?

365
00:27:52,279 --> 00:27:54,119
Well, we ended last night at an 8.6.

366
00:27:55,049 --> 00:27:56,329
This makes it an 8.7.

367
00:27:58,119 --> 00:27:58,759
Not that much.

368
00:27:58,759 --> 00:28:00,119
I only, it was like 15 seconds.

369
00:28:14,099 --> 00:28:15,220
He's pretending he just moved.

370
00:28:17,109 --> 00:28:17,750
This is pretty.

371
00:28:18,549 --> 00:28:19,190
Wait, items.

372
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:22,420
From Software always does this thing

373
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:25,160
where they put an item directly to the left

374
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,759
or directly to the right behind something.

375
00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:32,950
Like back here.

376
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:34,549
Oh, come on, there would be one right here.

377
00:28:34,549 --> 00:28:36,390
If this was any other game, it would be right here.

378
00:28:37,109 --> 00:28:40,420
You know I'm right.

379
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:40,740
All right.

380
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:43,220
Well, whatever.

381
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:44,900
Theory immediately debunked.

382
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:45,299
It's fine.

383
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:53,880
Didn't I fight this guy?

384
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,799
I fought like the illusion version of this guy.

385
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:01,720
Okay, I guess we're doing this.

386
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:05,339
Damn, that posture damage is fucking terrible.

387
00:29:06,059 --> 00:29:07,660
Oops.

388
00:29:10,339 --> 00:29:17,900
Oh, fuck, I thought he didn't know

389
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:18,539
he was going to keep going.

390
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:23,160
He's got three health bars.

391
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:32,059
Whoa, that hurts.

392
00:29:33,019 --> 00:29:45,109
I'm not fucking with that.

393
00:29:47,099 --> 00:30:00,279
Oh, no, no, no.

394
00:30:01,319 --> 00:30:08,630
Damn it, I'm getting too greedy.

395
00:30:10,539 --> 00:30:15,819
What's he going to do now?

396
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,039
Different, same.

397
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:21,480
All right, this is different.

398
00:30:24,759 --> 00:30:26,440
I think I'm just going to jump up here.

399
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,440
Whoa, he can go up.

400
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,319
What the fuck?

401
00:30:30,599 --> 00:30:30,920
What?

402
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:34,279
He has an extra long sword now.

403
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,440
Okay, maybe not a good idea.

404
00:30:37,240 --> 00:31:00,309
Wowee.

405
00:31:01,509 --> 00:31:07,450
Back it up, back it up, back it up, back it up.

406
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:08,329
Back, back, back, back, back.

407
00:31:09,289 --> 00:31:10,490
Fuck, I didn't time it right.

408
00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:24,059
All right, let's go, let's go.

409
00:31:24,859 --> 00:31:28,900
I think I figured, I think I know what he's going to do.

410
00:31:29,619 --> 00:31:31,930
Uh-oh, here comes a centipede.

411
00:31:32,650 --> 00:31:35,000
Is he going to do the mist again?

412
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:44,460
Whoa, that didn't work.

413
00:31:44,859 --> 00:31:45,259
Whoa.

414
00:31:46,059 --> 00:31:47,500
Okay, all right, all right, all right.

415
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:48,140
Slow it down.

416
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:53,049
Whoa.

417
00:31:55,210 --> 00:31:58,140
He does, it's all slides.

418
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:01,180
I got to get the fuck away from him.

419
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,359
It's, it's slashes.

420
00:32:07,079 --> 00:32:08,250
Let's go.

421
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:15,910
That's a grab.

422
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:16,470
No, it's not.

423
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:17,109
Is it terror?

424
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:20,299
I have no fucking idea what that is.

425
00:32:22,019 --> 00:32:22,500
Curious.

426
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:24,099
That's terror, isn't it?

427
00:32:24,819 --> 00:32:29,319
He's curious.

428
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:40,359
Faster.

429
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:51,849
It's not even worth blocking these because it takes too much.

430
00:32:51,849 --> 00:32:52,650
Whoop, that's far.

431
00:32:53,609 --> 00:32:56,660
Didn't jump fast enough.

432
00:32:57,940 --> 00:33:01,589
You know what?

433
00:33:01,589 --> 00:33:03,349
Posture candy, I think, is what I got to use here.

434
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:15,079
Damn it.

435
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:16,279
That was quick.

436
00:33:17,319 --> 00:33:23,190
I ain't giving up yet.

437
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:23,910
I ain't giving up yet.

438
00:33:23,910 --> 00:33:24,309
Hold on.

439
00:33:29,099 --> 00:33:29,900
So what's this?

440
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:31,980
Posture bites, I need, I need posture candy.

441
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:41,019
Shit.

442
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:44,980
Not good.

443
00:33:45,539 --> 00:34:03,940
Back it up, back it up.

444
00:35:25,099 --> 00:35:28,860
Don't you forget about me.

445
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:36,789
That's, that's the wrong thing equipped.

446
00:35:36,789 --> 00:35:39,190
That's the wrong thing.

447
00:35:39,989 --> 00:35:41,269
Wrong thing.

448
00:35:42,230 --> 00:36:35,380
Berry bush, berry bush, berry bush, berry bush, berry bush.

449
00:36:50,469 --> 00:36:52,309
Oh, it's okay.

450
00:36:52,309 --> 00:36:52,949
It's okay.

451
00:36:54,389 --> 00:36:54,789
Fire.

452
00:36:57,829 --> 00:36:58,230
Fire.

453
00:36:59,190 --> 00:37:01,159
I bring you fire.

454
00:37:02,039 --> 00:37:27,849
I am the god of hell fire and I bring you fire.

455
00:37:27,849 --> 00:37:40,039
I'm telling you, I got locked in the wall there.

456
00:37:40,039 --> 00:37:41,880
That was very bad.

457
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:53,449
That was so scary.

458
00:37:53,449 --> 00:37:57,030
Without that, without the firecrackers, I'm dead.

459
00:37:57,030 --> 00:37:59,880
That was a last-ditch effort to cracker them.

460
00:38:01,239 --> 00:38:11,719
Dragon's tally board.

461
00:38:11,719 --> 00:38:15,429
That's an iced coffee, huh?

462
00:38:15,429 --> 00:38:23,000
Possessing this increased the stocks that can be purchased in merchant shops.

463
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:25,780
Such a tally board is highly prized by the merchant class.

464
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:30,659
Old custom dictates that those of dragon rank are recognized as supreme merchants

465
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:33,079
by the imperial palace.

466
00:38:34,409 --> 00:38:36,309
So what does that mean?

467
00:38:39,139 --> 00:38:40,739
That means that I can buy more?

468
00:38:40,739 --> 00:38:42,179
They just have increased stock, I guess.

469
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:43,860
Interesting.

470
00:38:44,579 --> 00:38:50,570
That was a fun fight.

471
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:58,579
The last three, they've done like, the last three fights have just been awesome.

472
00:38:59,139 --> 00:39:02,809
Let's get that power up.

473
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:05,139
True monk.

474
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:10,840
Uh-huh.

475
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:13,239
The corrupted monk was among the infested.

476
00:39:13,239 --> 00:39:15,000
Standing over the fountainhead palace,

477
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:20,039
indeed, immortality would seem a fitting quality for eternal watcher of the palace.

478
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:22,840
Her true name is Priestess Yao.

479
00:39:26,389 --> 00:39:27,829
He hated the guardian ape.

480
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:30,219
No, guardian ape was fucking cool.

481
00:39:31,099 --> 00:39:38,699
It was just, that secret second boss fight was just fucking hard as shit.

482
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:43,059
Okay, attack power's been enhanced.

483
00:39:45,429 --> 00:39:46,949
So I have a please backseat me.

484
00:39:47,590 --> 00:39:49,909
This is a please backseat me chat, okay?

485
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:52,980
What do these do?

486
00:39:53,929 --> 00:39:55,449
I feel like I've been holding on to both of these.

487
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:03,989
I mean, raise in prayer between one's palms to restore a node of res-

488
00:40:03,989 --> 00:40:05,429
Do I get to only just do this once?

489
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:11,539
It just refills a resurrection node.

490
00:40:12,179 --> 00:40:15,780
So it doesn't add another resurrection, it just refills one.

491
00:40:20,059 --> 00:40:20,940
Does it consume it?

492
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:22,940
If I do this, that's it.

493
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:23,980
I just get to do it once.

494
00:40:24,949 --> 00:40:25,429
One use.

495
00:40:27,269 --> 00:40:29,829
So let's say I was having like an intense boss fight and I died,

496
00:40:29,829 --> 00:40:32,869
and I had the black bar down there, and I took one of those.

497
00:40:33,429 --> 00:40:34,869
I would be able to do it again.

498
00:40:34,869 --> 00:40:40,619
You could do that, yes.

499
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:42,619
Exactly, yes.

500
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:44,139
I don't think so.

501
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:49,300
I love that.

502
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:50,900
You can use it after your res, all right.

503
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:58,599
Let's rest.

504
00:40:59,239 --> 00:41:01,719
Dude, I- it was like two or three part-

505
00:41:03,739 --> 00:41:05,900
When I had the poison equipped wrong,

506
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:07,659
and I thought that was gonna throw me off, that was gonna-

507
00:41:07,659 --> 00:41:08,300
This is beautiful.

508
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:12,250
Fountainhead Palace.

509
00:41:18,010 --> 00:41:18,329
Points.

510
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,199
All right, I've hit five.

511
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:28,860
I have that skill.

512
00:41:29,659 --> 00:41:31,619
I've neglected this so much.

513
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:35,050
I just don't know where to go.

514
00:41:35,929 --> 00:41:38,739
This is gonna increase it by one.

515
00:41:38,739 --> 00:41:39,539
I don't think it's worth it.

516
00:41:45,639 --> 00:41:46,440
Maybe one of these.

517
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:47,639
What do these do?

518
00:41:47,639 --> 00:41:48,440
Shouldn't it be eyes?

519
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:54,679
Ooh, I'm fairly good at countering those.

520
00:41:55,320 --> 00:42:04,099
I'd do the Makiri counter like six out of ten times.

521
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:09,670
Yeah, I'm gonna get this.

522
00:42:17,079 --> 00:42:18,440
So now I have run and slide.

523
00:42:22,150 --> 00:42:24,820
And, oh, I gotta get this one too.

524
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:26,980
No, wait, what?

525
00:42:31,639 --> 00:42:32,840
I do have to get this, do I?

526
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:34,539
I guess so.

527
00:42:36,739 --> 00:42:43,030
KDKD945, thanks for the five community subs.

528
00:42:43,030 --> 00:42:47,139
Thank you so much for the five subs.

529
00:42:48,150 --> 00:42:49,349
So, look at how close I am.

530
00:42:49,349 --> 00:42:50,710
I just gotta kill like a couple people.

531
00:42:56,260 --> 00:42:57,380
Damn, all right.

532
00:42:57,380 --> 00:42:57,860
I'm ready.

533
00:42:57,860 --> 00:42:59,539
I told you I was gonna come ready to play today.

534
00:43:00,179 --> 00:43:01,349
I told you that.

535
00:43:01,349 --> 00:43:04,550
Last night, owl gone in a fucking try.

536
00:43:04,550 --> 00:43:05,590
Today, let's go.

537
00:43:05,590 --> 00:43:06,309
I'm ready to game.

538
00:43:06,869 --> 00:43:17,000
I've got my caramel macchiato from Starbucks.

539
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:17,559
It sucks.

540
00:43:18,119 --> 00:43:20,679
It's really not that good, but I still have it.

541
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:29,269
This thing too.

542
00:43:32,630 --> 00:43:35,110
Another five community subs from KDK.

543
00:43:36,699 --> 00:43:41,000
Damn, five more subs from KDK.

544
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:41,400
Thank you.

545
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:44,010
All right, let's go.

546
00:43:44,010 --> 00:43:44,409
Let's go.

547
00:43:44,409 --> 00:43:44,889
Let's game.

548
00:43:48,219 --> 00:43:49,260
So let's head out here.

549
00:43:50,789 --> 00:43:51,750
Wait, one last thing.

550
00:43:52,389 --> 00:43:55,980
Which one of these is the best?

551
00:43:56,539 --> 00:44:00,900
What's the puppeteer one?

552
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:05,239
Maybe this one sounds interesting.

553
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:10,780
All right.

554
00:44:13,449 --> 00:44:17,099
I don't know if anybody else gets like this

555
00:44:17,099 --> 00:44:17,980
when they play these games,

556
00:44:18,699 --> 00:44:22,699
but after like an intense fight that you win,

557
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:27,139
I don't know why this doesn't happen when you lose.

558
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:30,500
Maybe it's because your body doesn't have any time to relax,

559
00:44:31,690 --> 00:44:33,929
but after killing that guy,

560
00:44:34,570 --> 00:44:36,170
I was like this.

561
00:44:36,170 --> 00:44:41,449
Like, and I need a second to just fucking relax.

562
00:44:42,409 --> 00:44:42,730
Okay.

563
00:44:43,449 --> 00:44:45,380
It doesn't happen when I lose.

564
00:44:47,769 --> 00:44:50,090
I think it's your body just unwinding

565
00:44:50,889 --> 00:44:52,969
because you still wound up the whole time.

566
00:44:52,969 --> 00:44:58,150
I just gotta look at this.

567
00:44:58,710 --> 00:45:00,599
Where's the selfie camera?

568
00:45:00,599 --> 00:45:01,480
Just take a pic.

569
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:04,280
Take a note from the spider man.

570
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:05,079
Whatever.

571
00:45:05,079 --> 00:45:07,510
I'm too busy looking.

572
00:45:07,510 --> 00:45:08,309
This is beautiful.

573
00:45:08,309 --> 00:45:09,110
This is the part that I like.

574
00:45:09,110 --> 00:45:10,789
This is my favorite zone so far.

575
00:45:10,789 --> 00:45:16,969
I could get hurt by falling here.

576
00:45:16,969 --> 00:45:22,469
Oh, I guess we didn't even hurt.

577
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:32,099
Yeah, this is lovely.

578
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:44,869
Let me see.

579
00:45:53,659 --> 00:45:54,159
Ooh.

580
00:45:56,139 --> 00:46:01,019
KDK again is on like a five sub every 30 second interval.

581
00:46:02,539 --> 00:46:07,909
Thank you KDK again for the five community subs.

582
00:46:07,909 --> 00:46:08,710
That's...

583
00:46:08,710 --> 00:46:11,780
Is that a dog?

584
00:46:13,780 --> 00:46:14,820
No, it's got like a...

585
00:46:14,820 --> 00:46:17,219
No, it's one of those weird alien people.

586
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:37,880
He's my friend.

587
00:46:39,610 --> 00:46:40,489
See, I didn't kill him.

588
00:46:40,489 --> 00:46:44,920
I just brought him back as a close friend of mine.

589
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:45,559
What do you want to do?

590
00:46:46,519 --> 00:46:47,849
I don't know.

591
00:46:47,849 --> 00:46:48,650
Finally, have a go...

592
00:46:48,650 --> 00:46:49,690
Okay, you can co-op now.

593
00:46:50,170 --> 00:46:52,489
This is how you do co-op in Sekiro.

594
00:46:53,130 --> 00:46:55,239
You have to control their minds.

595
00:46:55,239 --> 00:46:56,039
KDK again.

596
00:46:59,139 --> 00:47:00,179
KDK added again.

597
00:47:03,829 --> 00:47:04,469
Yeah, okay.

598
00:47:04,469 --> 00:47:06,150
Those of you that are concerned about co-op,

599
00:47:06,150 --> 00:47:07,269
just get this ability

600
00:47:08,070 --> 00:47:09,510
and then pretend that your friend's over.

601
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:19,980
Oh, god damn it, dude.

602
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:20,619
Really?

603
00:47:20,619 --> 00:47:22,219
You got hit by the fucking arrow there.

604
00:47:22,219 --> 00:47:24,219
Now we have to go back to the beginning.

605
00:47:24,219 --> 00:47:25,500
I have to reload the game.

606
00:47:27,369 --> 00:47:28,489
Just try not to die.

607
00:47:29,130 --> 00:47:33,750
From Software is like the worst making co-op parts of video games.

608
00:47:34,309 --> 00:47:38,099
Let me go back and put my soapstone down again.

609
00:47:38,099 --> 00:47:38,739
God damn it.

610
00:47:48,099 --> 00:47:49,539
I didn't even know what that was.

611
00:47:49,539 --> 00:47:50,659
I don't know what happened.

612
00:47:50,659 --> 00:47:51,539
Fucking god damn it.

613
00:47:51,539 --> 00:47:53,699
Yeah, I'll see you in 22 more minutes.

614
00:48:01,619 --> 00:48:03,139
My game just had crashed.

615
00:48:03,139 --> 00:48:14,260
I'm a funny streamer.

616
00:48:15,219 --> 00:48:15,780
Thanks.

617
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:17,960
I tried.

618
00:48:18,599 --> 00:48:20,760
We do like jokes and comedy here.

619
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:21,800
I'll give you a routine.

620
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:22,039
Ready?

621
00:48:22,039 --> 00:48:23,159
Like, hey, it's me.

622
00:48:24,199 --> 00:48:25,960
Playing on the drum.

623
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:26,840
Not anymore.

624
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:27,239
Got you.

625
00:48:27,239 --> 00:48:29,880
Oh, my livelihood.

626
00:48:31,079 --> 00:48:40,170
Another five subs from KDK.

627
00:48:40,170 --> 00:48:41,610
Are you going to do this like the whole time?

628
00:48:42,650 --> 00:48:44,329
Five more subs from KDK.

629
00:48:48,869 --> 00:48:51,349
This is just going to keep going.

630
00:48:51,349 --> 00:48:52,469
This guy's 43.

631
00:48:52,469 --> 00:48:53,190
Not even close.

632
00:48:53,829 --> 00:48:57,769
I kind of just want to look around.

633
00:48:57,769 --> 00:48:58,409
I like this place.

634
00:49:04,139 --> 00:49:04,940
He's 60.

635
00:49:04,940 --> 00:49:07,500
I sound 60 at the moment.

636
00:49:13,530 --> 00:49:15,829
Well, there's a guy over here.

637
00:49:18,199 --> 00:49:19,719
This place is huge.

638
00:49:19,719 --> 00:49:23,590
Ooh, all right.

639
00:49:24,630 --> 00:49:28,679
Oh, these are the treasurers.

640
00:49:28,679 --> 00:49:29,880
These are the treasurers.

641
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:33,960
Um, somebody just threw a toaster in here.

642
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:34,760
How do I get out of here?

643
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:42,599
It's okay.

644
00:49:42,599 --> 00:49:45,670
This get out of the water.

645
00:49:45,670 --> 00:49:46,469
Get out of the water.

646
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,280
That guy has lightning.

647
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:51,079
I told you.

648
00:49:51,719 --> 00:49:53,400
Do you guys remember when I played Hitman?

649
00:49:54,340 --> 00:49:55,780
And I made the reference.

650
00:49:55,780 --> 00:49:58,900
I threw like a fucking piece of electrical equipment into the ocean.

651
00:50:01,139 --> 00:50:05,300
And everyone laughed at me because I said I was going to electrocute everybody

652
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:06,980
that was currently in the Atlantic Ocean.

653
00:50:09,210 --> 00:50:11,289
You tell me that I'm I'm I'm bullshit now.

654
00:50:16,489 --> 00:50:21,210
That guy just threw a little bit of electricity in a gigantic lake and killed me.

655
00:50:24,059 --> 00:50:25,019
That wouldn't happen with that.

656
00:50:25,019 --> 00:50:27,019
Okay, seriously myth busters.

657
00:50:28,869 --> 00:50:32,710
If I was in a, um, if I was in a lake this big

658
00:50:33,860 --> 00:50:37,300
and somebody just put an electrical current into the water, what would happen?

659
00:50:37,860 --> 00:50:39,139
Would I be fine?

660
00:50:42,409 --> 00:50:44,489
No, nothing.

661
00:50:48,219 --> 00:50:49,340
Okay, how small?

662
00:50:49,340 --> 00:50:51,340
Okay, what myth buster level?

663
00:50:52,059 --> 00:50:56,139
How small would the body of water have to be if you put like 10,000 watts

664
00:50:56,139 --> 00:50:56,780
into the water?

665
00:50:59,780 --> 00:51:02,699
Are we talking like a large swimming pool?

666
00:51:02,699 --> 00:51:04,460
A bathtub?

667
00:51:09,929 --> 00:51:11,210
A kiddie pool?

668
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:15,179
Let's go with lightning.

669
00:51:15,179 --> 00:51:16,860
KDK just gave 10 more subs.

670
00:51:20,489 --> 00:51:23,449
The electrodes would dissipate after 20 feet.

671
00:51:23,449 --> 00:51:23,769
What?

672
00:51:23,769 --> 00:51:28,380
Okay, so if I was in like a swimming pool

673
00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:32,539
and you threw like a supercharged toaster into the swimming pool plugged in,

674
00:51:32,539 --> 00:51:33,099
I'd be fine.

675
00:51:33,820 --> 00:51:35,690
Are we sure?

676
00:51:35,690 --> 00:51:47,579
Or maybe let's test it.

677
00:51:48,699 --> 00:51:51,860
No, I just don't know.

678
00:51:51,860 --> 00:51:52,820
Like I'm curious.

679
00:51:53,619 --> 00:51:55,940
Okay, if like if you, that's why they say get out of the water.

680
00:51:55,940 --> 00:51:57,780
If like there's a thunderstorm, right?

681
00:51:59,420 --> 00:52:03,099
I remember when I was a kid, when I was like fucking 10, I had a pool

682
00:52:03,820 --> 00:52:05,980
and it was always like the second that you'd hear like

683
00:52:08,139 --> 00:52:10,860
my father would fucking rip open the sliding door.

684
00:52:12,139 --> 00:52:14,300
Everybody get the fuck out of the pool right now.

685
00:52:15,639 --> 00:52:16,760
Dad, what are you talking about?

686
00:52:17,559 --> 00:52:19,960
He was like reaching and like trying to grab us like get out.

687
00:52:20,599 --> 00:52:26,300
If lightning struck inside the pool.

688
00:52:32,119 --> 00:52:36,820
I'm going to move on from this conversation because it's fucking stupid.

689
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:40,500
Okay, if lightning struck the Atlantic Ocean while there are people swimming.

690
00:52:43,980 --> 00:52:45,019
Okay, I'm done.

691
00:52:45,019 --> 00:52:45,980
I have to concentrate.

692
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:59,480
KDK, KDK, I think you have like, I think you're on auto by.

693
00:53:02,860 --> 00:53:04,380
Ow, ow, ow.

694
00:53:04,380 --> 00:53:05,579
No, not into the lightning water.

695
00:53:06,139 --> 00:53:06,860
What, no.

696
00:53:06,860 --> 00:53:09,500
Oh, where's my heel?

697
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:11,420
What the fuck is happening with my heel?

698
00:53:21,059 --> 00:53:26,409
All right, I took, I took it off the bar because I was in the middle of heated,

699
00:53:26,969 --> 00:53:28,570
heated exchange.

700
00:53:28,570 --> 00:53:34,500
Okay, all right.

701
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:35,940
Hey, look at how beautiful this is.

702
00:53:35,940 --> 00:53:36,420
Remember this?

703
00:53:41,530 --> 00:53:42,090
Thank God.

704
00:53:46,579 --> 00:53:47,219
All right, let's go.

705
00:53:47,780 --> 00:53:49,050
I don't need to go in the house.

706
00:53:51,219 --> 00:53:54,139
I need to go on top of the house though,

707
00:53:54,139 --> 00:53:56,139
because that's where these guys are throwing shit at me from.

708
00:53:56,780 --> 00:54:00,380
Why would there be stealth grass here?

709
00:54:01,019 --> 00:54:07,219
I don't think I've ever aggroed one of these guys.

710
00:54:07,940 --> 00:54:13,050
He's just like, snorting.

711
00:54:13,050 --> 00:54:13,610
What is that?

712
00:54:21,559 --> 00:54:22,199
The magic?

713
00:54:24,179 --> 00:54:26,019
He's just throwing punches at nothing.

714
00:54:26,980 --> 00:54:33,449
I don't know what that thing is.

715
00:54:35,190 --> 00:54:37,030
What bar, okay, what is he doing from me?

716
00:54:37,030 --> 00:54:38,389
Is he sucking souls from me?

717
00:54:39,909 --> 00:54:45,079
All right, let's go back and kick this guy's ass.

718
00:54:46,119 --> 00:54:48,039
Do they guys just have 200 fucking dollars?

719
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:51,849
Am I reading that right?

720
00:54:52,409 --> 00:54:59,340
Why don't I just grind these guys?

721
00:55:00,059 --> 00:55:08,969
Okay, let's go around here, get the guy up top.

722
00:55:20,730 --> 00:55:21,210
Ahem.

723
00:55:21,210 --> 00:55:23,210
But KDK, you've given so many subs.

724
00:55:23,210 --> 00:55:23,929
Thank you so much.

725
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:32,119
Oops.

726
00:55:32,119 --> 00:55:33,639
Well, it's okay.

727
00:55:33,639 --> 00:55:34,920
Will he shoot arrows for me?

728
00:55:41,110 --> 00:55:41,590
Go get him.

729
00:55:44,179 --> 00:55:45,380
Will we go get him?

730
00:55:50,340 --> 00:55:52,019
Go, go do something.

731
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:55,239
They're both just looking at each other.

732
00:55:55,239 --> 00:55:56,119
What is that guy doing?

733
00:56:09,110 --> 00:56:10,789
All right, well, there goes that one.

734
00:56:12,889 --> 00:56:14,570
I just have this one more somewhere.

735
00:56:18,809 --> 00:56:21,190
Check for items.

736
00:56:21,190 --> 00:56:22,309
Holy shit, okay.

737
00:56:23,820 --> 00:56:34,380
Well, you know what?

738
00:56:34,380 --> 00:56:37,179
Okay, I'll tell you one gripe that I have with the game.

739
00:56:37,179 --> 00:56:37,980
Are you ready?

740
00:56:37,980 --> 00:56:38,699
Are you ready for it?

741
00:56:38,699 --> 00:56:39,820
Not a complaint, a gripe.

742
00:56:39,820 --> 00:56:40,780
It's different.

743
00:56:40,780 --> 00:56:42,139
So I'm in stealth right now, right?

744
00:56:42,699 --> 00:56:43,500
I'm in sneak mode.

745
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:43,900
Here we go.

746
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:45,340
I'm going to backstab you.

747
00:56:45,340 --> 00:56:46,460
Okay, I can't do it now.

748
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,159
All right, what I was going to say was that was bad.

749
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:55,239
Listen, when you backstab somebody in stealth,

750
00:56:55,239 --> 00:56:57,639
you are automatically like standing up.

751
00:56:57,639 --> 00:56:59,800
I wish you would just stay crouching

752
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:03,400
because if I sneak up and backstab somebody,

753
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:04,360
you're just like this.

754
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:05,159
Then you kind of just stand.

755
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:07,960
That's a little minor gripe.

756
00:57:08,599 --> 00:57:21,559
Oh, you want to go again?

757
00:57:22,199 --> 00:57:29,989
How would you stab somebody without standing up?

758
00:57:31,030 --> 00:57:32,949
Yeah, but I mean, like this is a video game.

759
00:57:32,949 --> 00:57:33,989
All right, I got the Grape Wax.

760
00:57:33,989 --> 00:57:35,510
I need, actually really do need these.

761
00:57:36,230 --> 00:57:39,139
This is a Nintendo game, guys.

762
00:57:39,699 --> 00:57:45,099
I didn't get that item, whatever it is.

763
00:57:45,820 --> 00:57:49,420
There's different rules.

764
00:57:50,059 --> 00:57:54,889
How do I get in?

765
00:57:54,889 --> 00:57:57,210
Oh, this whole little area over here.

766
00:58:17,690 --> 00:58:18,570
What's that guy doing?

767
00:58:18,570 --> 00:58:20,010
Oh, he's sucking my life up.

768
00:58:20,010 --> 00:58:21,130
That guy's sucking my life up.

769
00:58:22,170 --> 00:58:23,289
Oh God, what happened when this fills up?

770
00:58:24,090 --> 00:58:25,219
What's wrong with me?

771
00:58:38,489 --> 00:58:41,849
The only way this guy's from stage right.

772
00:58:48,170 --> 00:58:50,650
All right, I think I should just keep going forward.

773
00:58:54,460 --> 00:58:56,059
So it makes you enfeebled.

774
00:58:56,780 --> 00:58:58,139
By the way, the one guy in chat,

775
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:01,320
I did look over there and see somebody said,

776
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:02,039
let it fill up.

777
00:59:02,039 --> 00:59:03,719
You get a flute, not a joke.

778
00:59:05,210 --> 00:59:08,489
Very clearly that turned out to be a fucking total bunch of horse shit.

779
00:59:09,210 --> 00:59:12,730
I didn't like do that on purpose, but still like what dog shit.

780
00:59:13,980 --> 00:59:15,980
Never reading chat ever again, by the way.

781
00:59:16,780 --> 00:59:23,590
Like coins.

782
00:59:23,590 --> 00:59:25,510
There's good, there's items here that I want.

783
00:59:26,309 --> 00:59:27,860
I don't want to just disappear.

784
00:59:32,679 --> 00:59:33,880
No, no, no, no, no.

785
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:34,360
Don't do it.

786
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,380
I think it's just line of sight.

787
00:59:37,380 --> 00:59:48,739
How could you win that?

788
00:59:49,699 --> 00:59:57,260
All right.

789
00:59:57,260 --> 01:00:07,699
Can you, if you read this, suck a fart out of my ass.

790
01:00:07,699 --> 01:00:09,460
You're gonna regret that in like five years.

791
01:00:10,340 --> 01:00:28,139
Oh, there's the slide.

792
01:00:28,139 --> 01:00:29,420
That's the first time I've seen that.

793
01:00:30,059 --> 01:00:45,750
He's gonna regret that one in five years.

794
01:00:46,869 --> 01:00:51,980
Any more items?

795
01:00:55,860 --> 01:00:57,139
Uh, shitload of items over here.

796
01:00:57,860 --> 01:01:07,639
Apparently somebody can still, oh, there's archers up there.

797
01:01:14,380 --> 01:01:16,139
Item surrounded by dogs.

798
01:01:19,110 --> 01:01:20,389
Two guys up here.

799
01:01:22,119 --> 01:01:26,059
Where is, can I get up here without being seen by that one?

800
01:01:26,619 --> 01:01:27,019
Yep.

801
01:01:27,019 --> 01:01:27,820
See if I can get them both.

802
01:01:36,860 --> 01:01:38,139
Oh, that's not a backstab.

803
01:01:38,139 --> 01:01:39,179
Yes, it is in every book.

804
01:01:52,099 --> 01:01:53,699
You're only an hour in right now.

805
01:01:53,699 --> 01:01:54,579
Don't go too crazy.

806
01:01:54,579 --> 01:01:55,539
You're gonna burn out.

807
01:01:58,010 --> 01:02:00,409
I am the brightest star you've ever seen.

808
01:02:01,449 --> 01:02:03,289
No, no way.

809
01:02:03,929 --> 01:02:07,210
He's going to take the entire full brunt of a star.

810
01:02:08,010 --> 01:02:10,889
I laughed out loud when that line went up, by the way.

811
01:02:11,849 --> 01:02:13,130
No, he's crazy.

812
01:02:13,130 --> 01:02:16,489
There's no way he can take the full brunt of a star.

813
01:02:17,210 --> 01:02:20,440
I was the guy in the theater going.

814
01:02:21,559 --> 01:02:41,050
Peek-a-boo.

815
01:02:41,050 --> 01:02:41,690
That's how you do it.

816
01:02:41,690 --> 01:02:42,650
I want you to fucking clip that.

817
01:02:42,650 --> 01:02:44,409
I want you to fucking read into that.

818
01:02:44,409 --> 01:02:45,610
When you talk about games,

819
01:02:45,610 --> 01:02:47,369
gamers that you should pay attention to.

820
01:02:47,369 --> 01:02:49,849
Top 10 gamers you should bet you pay attention to in 2019.

821
01:02:50,409 --> 01:02:51,289
Look at that for a clip.

822
01:02:52,010 --> 01:02:52,889
Keep that one.

823
01:02:52,889 --> 01:03:08,250
Who's over here?

824
01:03:08,730 --> 01:03:14,440
Okay, we have two dogs.

825
01:03:20,519 --> 01:03:33,880
That thing got in the way.

826
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:35,460
These things are good.

827
01:03:36,099 --> 01:03:36,980
Dog t-shirts.

828
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:41,400
Hydrate?

829
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:41,960
Yeah, okay.

830
01:03:55,480 --> 01:03:55,960
Yeah, I don't know.

831
01:03:55,960 --> 01:03:57,960
I think there's something wrong with them.

832
01:03:57,960 --> 01:04:00,469
I don't know.

833
01:04:00,469 --> 01:04:02,710
Like, I was watching earlier and I keep...

834
01:04:02,710 --> 01:04:04,389
I feel like he was just kind of talking

835
01:04:04,389 --> 01:04:05,590
like to somebody in his own head.

836
01:04:05,590 --> 01:04:06,710
It was really fucking weird.

837
01:04:06,710 --> 01:04:08,550
It was kind of maybe uncomfortable.

838
01:04:08,550 --> 01:04:09,750
I don't think I'll be watching again.

839
01:04:19,940 --> 01:04:20,440
Same.

840
01:04:21,139 --> 01:04:23,190
All right, don't rest here.

841
01:04:25,239 --> 01:04:27,239
You know, you have to play together and not over each other.

842
01:04:27,639 --> 01:04:38,550
How many times are you gonna make the disillusioned viewer joke

843
01:04:38,550 --> 01:04:40,789
as many times as I deem necessary?

844
01:04:44,340 --> 01:04:47,139
Disillusioned viewer joke.

845
01:04:53,739 --> 01:04:55,260
I do use it a lot, don't I?

846
01:05:00,389 --> 01:05:08,280
Oh, every other streamer beat this game.

847
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:09,239
Are you taking your time?

848
01:05:09,239 --> 01:05:10,039
Are you just bad?

849
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:11,780
I tag.

850
01:05:13,750 --> 01:05:16,230
Yeah, did they beat the fucking true monk first try?

851
01:05:16,230 --> 01:05:17,349
You showed me somebody that did.

852
01:05:17,989 --> 01:05:23,670
I...

853
01:05:23,670 --> 01:05:25,989
I took two days off in the middle of this playthrough.

854
01:05:26,550 --> 01:05:27,349
Who the hell is that?

855
01:05:29,820 --> 01:05:31,420
I first tried two bosses in a row.

856
01:05:31,420 --> 01:05:33,420
You want to find me a streamer that is capable

857
01:05:33,420 --> 01:05:34,539
or something like that?

858
01:05:35,179 --> 01:05:38,059
I think this is just an NPC.

859
01:05:38,619 --> 01:05:48,260
This is gonna be...

860
01:05:48,820 --> 01:05:50,980
I've seen Snow White and the Seven Dwarves.

861
01:05:51,539 --> 01:05:52,789
I'm not gonna eat that.

862
01:06:14,730 --> 01:06:15,230
Okay.

863
01:06:16,730 --> 01:06:18,409
The courtyard is cursed.

864
01:06:19,369 --> 01:06:23,050
Ooh!

865
01:06:25,190 --> 01:06:25,909
That was a big one.

866
01:06:32,389 --> 01:06:33,909
They went up on two wheels for that one.

867
01:06:34,710 --> 01:06:40,659
There's a bite down.

868
01:06:40,659 --> 01:06:41,780
I don't even need to bite down anymore.

869
01:06:41,780 --> 01:06:42,500
I have the tooth.

870
01:06:49,099 --> 01:06:50,219
Uh, I need more information.

871
01:06:50,780 --> 01:06:51,820
Don't go through the courtyard.

872
01:06:51,820 --> 01:06:53,099
Why are you telling me this?

873
01:07:13,130 --> 01:07:13,849
The Great Carp.

874
01:07:27,130 --> 01:07:27,630
Alright.

875
01:07:27,929 --> 01:07:28,889
This boss is a fish.

876
01:07:29,449 --> 01:07:33,369
Wouldn't wish for an eternity like that.

877
01:07:33,369 --> 01:07:34,949
The Great Carp.

878
01:07:36,409 --> 01:07:36,909
Uh.

879
01:07:37,210 --> 01:07:39,769
The courtyard is an accursed place.

880
01:07:39,769 --> 01:07:42,170
And if you please, keep my heart.

881
01:07:42,170 --> 01:07:43,769
I really hope this is not an underwater fight.

882
01:07:43,769 --> 01:07:45,210
They gave me the dive capability.

883
01:07:45,210 --> 01:07:46,489
Don't put an underwater fight here.

884
01:07:46,489 --> 01:07:47,530
That's the worst thing they could do.

885
01:07:50,230 --> 01:07:50,730
No.

886
01:07:51,190 --> 01:07:53,429
If there really is like an underwater boss fight or something.

887
01:07:54,710 --> 01:07:55,480
This guy...

888
01:07:55,480 --> 01:07:56,119
I...

889
01:07:56,119 --> 01:07:57,079
I already know what's gonna happen.

890
01:07:57,079 --> 01:07:57,719
I'm gonna...

891
01:07:57,719 --> 01:07:59,960
In like a year I'm gonna be reading

892
01:07:59,960 --> 01:08:01,239
and watching YouTube videos.

893
01:08:02,280 --> 01:08:05,320
Of top ten from software bosses.

894
01:08:05,320 --> 01:08:06,280
And this is gonna be number one.

895
01:08:12,389 --> 01:08:13,829
It wasn't the fight that was hard.

896
01:08:13,829 --> 01:08:15,349
It was dealing with being underwater.

897
01:08:15,349 --> 01:08:16,229
And it was unbearable.

898
01:08:16,229 --> 01:08:16,949
Oh no.

899
01:08:22,470 --> 01:08:22,970
Uh.

900
01:08:24,789 --> 01:08:25,909
I'm not ready for this.

901
01:08:32,060 --> 01:08:33,739
Go fight the giant fish.

902
01:08:33,739 --> 01:08:34,239
Alright, well.

903
01:08:34,939 --> 01:08:39,380
Can I like shot him up by throwing something?

904
01:08:39,380 --> 01:08:49,479
That's a tactic right there.

905
01:08:49,479 --> 01:08:57,300
The giant fish boss.

906
01:08:57,300 --> 01:08:57,800
Oh.

907
01:08:58,340 --> 01:08:59,500
Is that a boss?

908
01:08:59,500 --> 01:09:00,140
No.

909
01:09:00,140 --> 01:09:00,699
Mini boss?

910
01:09:01,260 --> 01:09:13,840
Watch it.

911
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:18,020
No!

912
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:20,479
I can't...

913
01:09:20,479 --> 01:09:21,520
I can't get, get, get, get, get.

914
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:22,479
How do I do something about this?

915
01:09:22,479 --> 01:09:22,979
What do I do?

916
01:09:23,760 --> 01:09:24,260
I don't know how to...

917
01:09:33,149 --> 01:09:34,430
That happened so fast.

918
01:09:34,430 --> 01:09:35,949
I thought I had at least a second or two.

919
01:09:38,250 --> 01:09:38,569
That...

920
01:09:38,569 --> 01:09:39,850
Why did that go so fast?

921
01:09:40,649 --> 01:09:42,939
Dude, that...

922
01:09:44,060 --> 01:09:47,020
That bar filled so much faster than it ever has.

923
01:09:54,539 --> 01:09:55,500
Mad because bad.

924
01:09:55,500 --> 01:09:56,539
Mad because bad.

925
01:09:56,539 --> 01:09:57,659
Mad because bad.

926
01:09:57,659 --> 01:09:58,460
Mad because bad.

927
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:01,039
I'm not mad at all.

928
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:02,500
I...

929
01:10:02,500 --> 01:10:03,039
Look.

930
01:10:03,039 --> 01:10:04,720
There's no way you saw me through there.

931
01:10:05,439 --> 01:10:08,270
Stupid.

932
01:10:08,270 --> 01:10:09,600
Dumb.

933
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:11,039
Nothing about it is fun.

934
01:10:11,039 --> 01:10:12,079
Nothing about this is fun.

935
01:10:12,720 --> 01:10:21,130
My god.

936
01:10:21,689 --> 01:10:25,239
Alright, I have an indicator here.

937
01:10:25,239 --> 01:10:25,560
What is it?

938
01:10:25,560 --> 01:10:26,920
Is it a slash?

939
01:10:26,920 --> 01:10:28,039
Is it a dash?

940
01:10:28,039 --> 01:10:29,239
Is it a crash?

941
01:10:29,239 --> 01:10:29,720
I don't know.

942
01:10:30,680 --> 01:10:33,979
I have the indicator for what?

943
01:10:36,119 --> 01:10:37,800
What is the indicator for if I can't do anything?

944
01:10:38,520 --> 01:10:41,130
It's a grab, but I can't dodge.

945
01:10:41,130 --> 01:10:45,520
I thought maybe you could time it and stop it.

946
01:10:52,079 --> 01:10:56,189
Well, this went from my favorite area to being

947
01:10:57,149 --> 01:11:01,930
my least favorite area in any From Software game that they've ever done.

948
01:11:02,649 --> 01:11:05,399
And I'm talking worse than Lost Izalith.

949
01:11:05,960 --> 01:11:13,899
I mean, but did you not finish this one too?

950
01:11:14,829 --> 01:11:16,039
God damn.

951
01:11:16,039 --> 01:11:17,000
Unbelievable.

952
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:17,640
Unbelievable.

953
01:11:20,649 --> 01:11:21,289
Not even fun.

954
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:25,119
What?

955
01:11:25,119 --> 01:11:26,479
What was it hitting the wall?

956
01:11:26,479 --> 01:11:27,359
What was it hitting?

957
01:11:28,159 --> 01:11:28,479
What?

958
01:11:29,899 --> 01:11:30,859
What was it hitting?

959
01:11:36,380 --> 01:11:37,260
Why was...

960
01:11:37,260 --> 01:11:38,699
I couldn't do the shuriken.

961
01:11:43,630 --> 01:11:46,270
Like, I threw two shurikens and it hit the thing.

962
01:11:46,350 --> 01:11:56,989
It hit the fucking fence.

963
01:11:56,989 --> 01:11:57,630
Don't do it again.

964
01:12:08,250 --> 01:12:08,970
Give me a break.

965
01:12:21,640 --> 01:12:22,439
Don't, don't, don't!

966
01:12:24,279 --> 01:12:25,560
Oh my god!

967
01:12:25,560 --> 01:12:26,520
I have to turn the...

968
01:12:26,520 --> 01:12:27,239
Why?

969
01:12:27,239 --> 01:12:27,560
Why?

970
01:12:30,350 --> 01:12:31,470
I have to swing at him.

971
01:12:41,359 --> 01:12:46,670
Oh my god.

972
01:12:46,670 --> 01:12:47,789
Yeah, one of the only...

973
01:12:47,789 --> 01:12:53,239
One of like the two stealth sections in this whole game.

974
01:12:53,239 --> 01:12:54,199
Activision threw...

975
01:12:54,199 --> 01:12:55,560
Activision made him do that.

976
01:12:55,560 --> 01:12:57,640
Activision told him to put a stealth mechanic in.

977
01:12:58,199 --> 01:13:01,470
Wait, wait, this is Activision.

978
01:13:01,470 --> 01:13:03,229
We need to stealth in our video games

979
01:13:03,229 --> 01:13:05,149
and all of our third-person adventure games.

980
01:13:22,300 --> 01:13:24,300
Look, slow them down!

981
01:13:24,300 --> 01:13:28,760
I want them to progress through this area.

982
01:13:29,319 --> 01:13:32,880
That snail's fucking face.

983
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:35,479
And then they're expected to parry

984
01:13:35,479 --> 01:13:39,479
like 200 fucking times in two seconds.

985
01:13:39,479 --> 01:13:44,670
I don't care if they're gonna kill me.

986
01:13:44,670 --> 01:13:45,390
I'll keep smoking.

987
01:13:46,109 --> 01:15:34,920
What is that noise?

988
01:15:34,920 --> 01:15:36,439
One, two, three...

989
01:15:38,039 --> 01:15:49,260
That's not safe.

990
01:15:49,260 --> 01:16:00,029
That's not safe over there.

991
01:16:00,029 --> 01:16:01,069
Eel liver, cool.

992
01:16:01,069 --> 01:16:01,789
It can go that way.

993
01:16:01,789 --> 01:16:02,270
Let's check.

994
01:16:02,909 --> 01:16:10,300
I'm just fucking around, guys.

995
01:16:10,300 --> 01:16:18,109
This is faux outrage.

996
01:16:18,109 --> 01:16:19,310
I'm faux angry.

997
01:16:24,670 --> 01:16:40,029
Don't you guys know the true meaning of when I'm angry?

998
01:16:40,029 --> 01:16:41,229
My voice gets shorter.

999
01:16:42,810 --> 01:16:44,250
I don't announce the words.

1000
01:16:44,250 --> 01:16:46,779
I say things fast like this.

1001
01:16:46,779 --> 01:16:48,829
My voice drops down like this.

1002
01:16:48,829 --> 01:16:49,710
No, it's fucking stupid.

1003
01:16:49,710 --> 01:16:50,670
It's fucking dumb.

1004
01:16:50,670 --> 01:16:52,699
I don't fucking...

1005
01:16:52,699 --> 01:16:53,979
It's fucking not even fun.

1006
01:16:53,979 --> 01:16:55,069
That's how you can tell.

1007
01:16:55,069 --> 01:16:58,029
When I do like impressions of Activision fucking suits,

1008
01:16:58,029 --> 01:16:58,909
I'm not...

1009
01:16:58,909 --> 01:16:59,550
This is fun.

1010
01:16:59,550 --> 01:17:00,350
I'm having a good time.

1011
01:17:01,800 --> 01:17:12,000
Wait, why would they put this?

1012
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:12,399
Of course.

1013
01:17:16,989 --> 01:17:18,270
Oh my god.

1014
01:17:22,109 --> 01:17:23,229
Please tell me they turn this way.

1015
01:17:23,789 --> 01:17:24,590
Did they go down there?

1016
01:17:25,869 --> 01:17:26,109
Why?

1017
01:17:26,109 --> 01:17:26,510
Did they just...

1018
01:17:26,510 --> 01:17:27,710
This is scripted.

1019
01:17:27,710 --> 01:17:28,750
This is a scripted event.

1020
01:17:43,180 --> 01:17:43,819
Dumb.

1021
01:17:43,819 --> 01:17:46,670
Okay, where do they go though?

1022
01:17:59,229 --> 01:18:00,109
Okay, I need to get this item

1023
01:18:00,109 --> 01:18:01,390
because they're gonna come back right now.

1024
01:18:01,390 --> 01:18:04,359
Confetti, I need that.

1025
01:18:04,359 --> 01:18:06,569
Oh, oh no.

1026
01:18:06,569 --> 01:18:08,010
Oh no, oh no, oh no.

1027
01:18:08,649 --> 01:18:09,050
Oh no?

1028
01:18:10,569 --> 01:18:17,390
They don't know where I am.

1029
01:18:17,390 --> 01:18:20,430
Oh fuck, I gotta kill that motherfucker right now.

1030
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:46,329
Where is he?

1031
01:18:46,329 --> 01:18:47,210
It's Shito.

1032
01:18:52,430 --> 01:18:53,069
That's right.

1033
01:18:53,630 --> 01:18:54,989
All right, this is the strategy.

1034
01:18:54,989 --> 01:18:55,390
You ready?

1035
01:18:55,390 --> 01:18:57,439
It's saying a head has to work.

1036
01:18:57,439 --> 01:18:59,930
This has to work.

1037
01:18:59,930 --> 01:19:02,729
Okay, strategy is firecrackers.

1038
01:19:03,369 --> 01:19:06,600
Firecrackers kill guy.

1039
01:19:06,600 --> 01:19:09,130
One, two, three.

1040
01:19:26,590 --> 01:19:27,920
All right, I gotta shut up.

1041
01:19:37,609 --> 01:19:38,489
Is there anybody in here?

1042
01:19:38,489 --> 01:19:41,119
No, I almost just fucking died.

1043
01:19:41,119 --> 01:19:44,270
Okay, so I can go here.

1044
01:19:45,470 --> 01:19:47,310
Question is, is this the only guy in here?

1045
01:19:47,310 --> 01:19:48,439
I don't know.

1046
01:19:48,439 --> 01:19:53,760
I think that's the only guy here.

1047
01:19:53,760 --> 01:19:56,000
If it's not, then I'm fucking jumping right back up.

1048
01:19:56,560 --> 01:20:22,810
Okay, I don't think there's very...

1049
01:20:22,810 --> 01:20:24,170
There's only a couple guys on the bridge.

1050
01:20:24,729 --> 01:20:33,500
I wanna jump back up here.

1051
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,159
I, I can't, I can't get up there.

1052
01:20:38,720 --> 01:20:41,600
I just came from here.

1053
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:57,050
All right, there's that, that's done.

1054
01:20:57,609 --> 01:21:00,319
What about over here?

1055
01:21:00,319 --> 01:21:03,239
Anybody?

1056
01:21:03,239 --> 01:21:05,050
I don't think, I think I got him.

1057
01:21:05,050 --> 01:21:06,569
All right, I'm just gonna keep going around.

1058
01:21:06,569 --> 01:21:15,340
All right, what about this way?

1059
01:21:15,899 --> 01:21:17,470
What do we got?

1060
01:21:17,470 --> 01:21:22,520
We got a guy on bridge over here, right?

1061
01:21:22,520 --> 01:21:23,079
No.

1062
01:21:23,079 --> 01:21:24,720
Two guys over there.

1063
01:21:24,720 --> 01:21:28,159
God damn it.

1064
01:21:28,159 --> 01:21:44,750
Is there a way to hide up there?

1065
01:21:45,310 --> 01:21:46,590
Yep, can I?

1066
01:21:46,590 --> 01:21:49,199
I'm not sure where to go.

1067
01:21:49,199 --> 01:21:58,859
Is this that?

1068
01:21:58,859 --> 01:22:00,300
I can't go that way yet.

1069
01:22:00,300 --> 01:22:01,420
I mean, I guess I could.

1070
01:22:01,420 --> 01:22:02,220
I could backstab that.

1071
01:22:02,220 --> 01:22:03,899
No, the guy across the way, we'll see.

1072
01:22:04,699 --> 01:22:12,409
I mean, there's stealth grass right here.

1073
01:22:13,050 --> 01:22:18,170
Is this stealth grass?

1074
01:22:18,170 --> 01:22:19,130
I don't know.

1075
01:22:19,130 --> 01:22:24,649
Oh, God damn it.

1076
01:22:28,539 --> 01:22:30,539
This is a real stealth section.

1077
01:22:30,539 --> 01:22:32,840
They're like, you know what?

1078
01:22:32,840 --> 01:22:34,680
We're like 24 hours into the game.

1079
01:22:34,760 --> 01:22:37,319
Throw a real actual stealth section into the game.

1080
01:22:42,960 --> 01:22:45,920
I just, that guy not gonna turn around and see this shit.

1081
01:22:47,180 --> 01:22:49,659
If he does, I'm gonna be in fucking trouble.

1082
01:22:54,649 --> 01:22:55,130
Why?

1083
01:22:56,890 --> 01:22:57,390
No.

1084
01:22:58,409 --> 01:22:59,289
Wait, get in the water.

1085
01:23:00,010 --> 01:23:03,239
Oh my God, there's a guy here.

1086
01:23:03,239 --> 01:23:03,640
Who is it?

1087
01:23:03,640 --> 01:23:04,119
Who is it?

1088
01:23:14,300 --> 01:23:15,420
What's with the indicators?

1089
01:23:16,460 --> 01:23:17,260
No, don't.

1090
01:23:18,060 --> 01:23:18,619
Get out.

1091
01:23:18,619 --> 01:23:19,180
Get out.

1092
01:23:19,180 --> 01:23:19,680
Run.

1093
01:23:20,220 --> 01:23:28,010
I don't even know where that guy came from.

1094
01:23:28,569 --> 01:23:29,369
Oh, fuck.

1095
01:23:32,430 --> 01:23:33,789
Okay, I can deal with him here.

1096
01:23:34,430 --> 01:23:46,189
What's with the fucking, all those indicators, man?

1097
01:23:47,069 --> 01:23:48,090
You're killing me.

1098
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:53,039
Oh, you're killing me.

1099
01:23:53,840 --> 01:23:54,880
It's like the president.

1100
01:23:55,920 --> 01:23:57,840
It's the president of the Whistle Club.

1101
01:23:57,840 --> 01:23:58,479
What do I do?

1102
01:23:59,199 --> 01:23:59,699
Is he?

1103
01:24:02,560 --> 01:24:03,920
It's Gandalf.

1104
01:24:03,920 --> 01:24:06,000
It's the Albus Dumbledore.

1105
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:07,760
How many more jokes can I make before I kill him?

1106
01:24:07,760 --> 01:24:08,260
Let's see.

1107
01:24:25,130 --> 01:24:25,630
Okay.

1108
01:24:27,920 --> 01:24:29,600
How much more is left of this section?

1109
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:30,720
I don't like this place.

1110
01:24:31,760 --> 01:24:32,560
I don't like this place.

1111
01:24:32,560 --> 01:24:34,239
It's too, if I fuck up anything.

1112
01:24:35,439 --> 01:24:36,239
Imagine right now.

1113
01:24:36,239 --> 01:24:37,760
Imagine just fucking up now.

1114
01:24:38,479 --> 01:24:40,159
And having to do the whole section over again.

1115
01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:42,720
I don't care if I look like a coward.

1116
01:24:42,720 --> 01:24:46,720
I'm going to do this as slow and as meticulously and stupid as I possibly can.

1117
01:24:56,729 --> 01:24:57,210
All right.

1118
01:24:57,210 --> 01:24:58,569
There's two on the bridge.

1119
01:24:59,880 --> 01:25:00,680
There's a guy.

1120
01:25:00,680 --> 01:25:01,880
There's two guys over here.

1121
01:25:01,880 --> 01:25:02,199
Yep.

1122
01:25:02,199 --> 01:25:04,840
I don't even know where the fucking president wizard came from.

1123
01:25:06,569 --> 01:25:07,689
I don't know.

1124
01:25:07,689 --> 01:25:09,130
I think he saw me from across the game.

1125
01:25:10,640 --> 01:25:37,600
So now, oh, how effective is this though?

1126
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:39,119
Will he see me if I walk out here?

1127
01:25:40,079 --> 01:25:58,460
Oh my God, it works.

1128
01:25:59,100 --> 01:25:59,979
It works.

1129
01:25:59,979 --> 01:26:02,300
Holy shit, it works.

1130
01:26:04,140 --> 01:26:07,800
Is there any more?

1131
01:26:07,800 --> 01:26:08,199
I don't know.

1132
01:26:08,199 --> 01:26:08,840
Who's over there?

1133
01:26:11,529 --> 01:26:12,170
Is there a guy?

1134
01:26:12,170 --> 01:26:13,770
I don't, it's a position.

1135
01:26:20,960 --> 01:26:21,520
Slow down.

1136
01:26:22,239 --> 01:26:32,760
Just stay back here.

1137
01:26:32,760 --> 01:26:33,640
No one will know I'm here.

1138
01:26:34,279 --> 01:26:51,899
Man, that would have been such a nightmare.

1139
01:26:51,899 --> 01:26:53,420
He keeps crawling around the corner.

1140
01:26:54,060 --> 01:26:59,710
This is harder than a boss.

1141
01:26:59,710 --> 01:27:01,470
It's not, it's not that it's hard.

1142
01:27:01,470 --> 01:27:03,470
It's just take, oh, I found a thing.

1143
01:27:10,140 --> 01:27:10,619
Thank God.

1144
01:27:12,199 --> 01:27:12,840
Thank God.

1145
01:27:14,189 --> 01:27:15,390
Wait, I hear something moving.

1146
01:27:16,029 --> 01:27:22,159
There's going to be one right here.

1147
01:27:22,159 --> 01:27:23,680
I'm not going to be able to commune with this.

1148
01:27:30,460 --> 01:27:31,180
Oh, yes.

1149
01:27:38,810 --> 01:27:42,460
Oh, oh, I feel so much better.

1150
01:27:42,460 --> 01:27:43,420
I have money though.

1151
01:27:44,140 --> 01:27:51,899
I got like, I have money.

1152
01:27:51,899 --> 01:27:53,180
I got to go back and spend this.

1153
01:27:53,979 --> 01:27:57,720
What was I going to get here?

1154
01:27:57,720 --> 01:27:58,119
This, right?

1155
01:27:58,760 --> 01:28:01,609
Increases damage inflicted posture.

1156
01:28:01,609 --> 01:28:02,489
Successful in the cure.

1157
01:28:02,489 --> 01:28:03,050
I wanted this.

1158
01:28:03,689 --> 01:28:07,050
That one's really good.

1159
01:28:07,609 --> 01:28:09,760
I land that pretty frequently, so.

1160
01:28:12,840 --> 01:28:15,640
And I have money that I need to spend.

1161
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:22,720
Why did I rest?

1162
01:28:23,039 --> 01:28:23,760
It's probably, I don't know.

1163
01:28:23,760 --> 01:28:24,560
I'm just paranoid.

1164
01:28:25,119 --> 01:28:26,560
And I just did it.

1165
01:28:26,560 --> 01:28:27,760
Muscle memory, just press the button.

1166
01:28:33,550 --> 01:28:37,319
Okay, let's see how much further I can go down here.

1167
01:28:40,319 --> 01:28:46,359
I need, I got the money, but I need gunpowder.

1168
01:28:47,579 --> 01:28:48,859
Does somebody sell gunpowder?

1169
01:28:56,880 --> 01:28:58,159
I don't think this guy does.

1170
01:28:58,159 --> 01:28:59,359
Who sells gunpowder?

1171
01:29:02,840 --> 01:29:07,449
Okay, how many do you have?

1172
01:29:07,449 --> 01:29:07,850
Just one?

1173
01:29:10,750 --> 01:29:13,710
Oh, damn, I can just buy you up 10 of them.

1174
01:29:14,270 --> 01:29:17,289
I need two for now, right?

1175
01:29:17,289 --> 01:29:18,090
Was it four or five?

1176
01:29:27,800 --> 01:29:28,359
What was it?

1177
01:29:28,359 --> 01:29:28,920
Four or five?

1178
01:29:28,920 --> 01:29:30,039
I think it was four.

1179
01:29:30,039 --> 01:29:30,600
Yeah.

1180
01:29:30,600 --> 01:29:32,840
All right, so this is, I'm upgrading my favorite item in the game.

1181
01:29:34,029 --> 01:29:34,750
Long spark.

1182
01:29:35,470 --> 01:29:39,039
The effect to be prolonged for longer than the average firecracker.

1183
01:29:39,039 --> 01:29:41,680
And the flames bloom for a short time.

1184
01:29:41,680 --> 01:29:42,000
Nice.

1185
01:29:43,439 --> 01:29:46,170
We're getting there.

1186
01:29:46,170 --> 01:29:55,180
Let's put it on.

1187
01:29:55,180 --> 01:29:57,420
So I got spring loaded firecracker.

1188
01:29:58,060 --> 01:29:59,340
Shinobi firecracker.

1189
01:30:00,670 --> 01:30:05,449
Wait, am I stupid?

1190
01:30:06,010 --> 01:30:10,300
No, it's got long.

1191
01:30:10,300 --> 01:30:11,180
Okay, I already had one.

1192
01:30:11,180 --> 01:30:12,300
Okay, I was like, wait a minute.

1193
01:30:12,300 --> 01:30:13,739
Yeah, long spark.

1194
01:30:13,739 --> 01:30:21,069
Let's try it.

1195
01:30:21,630 --> 01:30:29,020
I didn't even look at what this does.

1196
01:30:30,680 --> 01:30:33,720
One can fluidly swap between two separate sets of attacks as desired.

1197
01:30:34,279 --> 01:30:36,159
That's cool.

1198
01:30:37,760 --> 01:30:38,720
Spring loaded axe.

1199
01:30:39,600 --> 01:30:44,109
I mean, it's pretty default of me, but I really do like these the most.

1200
01:30:44,750 --> 01:30:45,710
Let's see how this looks.

1201
01:30:49,020 --> 01:30:50,939
Call me a default streamer, but that's fine.

1202
01:30:52,220 --> 01:30:54,829
Whoa.

1203
01:30:55,470 --> 01:30:57,630
Well, that takes a little longer to do, but that's,

1204
01:31:04,569 --> 01:31:05,850
I wonder how much different that is.

1205
01:31:07,800 --> 01:31:09,479
That's a long cast time.

1206
01:31:11,479 --> 01:31:11,880
We'll see.

1207
01:31:17,130 --> 01:31:17,609
No, okay.

1208
01:31:17,609 --> 01:31:18,569
I don't have to hold it.

1209
01:31:18,569 --> 01:31:18,810
All right.

1210
01:31:18,810 --> 01:31:20,170
That's that's looks better.

1211
01:31:20,810 --> 01:31:27,130
All right.

1212
01:31:27,130 --> 01:31:29,869
So we ended up fountainhead palace.

1213
01:31:29,869 --> 01:31:30,989
One, two, three.

1214
01:31:33,479 --> 01:31:37,550
Wait, wait, I need my money.

1215
01:31:37,550 --> 01:31:46,560
I got to store my money in sacks because I got 600 bucks.

1216
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:47,920
I can store it.

1217
01:31:57,659 --> 01:31:59,260
Money is stored in the balls.

1218
01:32:06,840 --> 01:32:07,479
That's an old one.

1219
01:32:07,479 --> 01:32:08,199
That's very old.

1220
01:32:08,760 --> 01:32:16,079
I can buy one of these, which leaves me with 80 bucks.

1221
01:32:16,079 --> 01:32:18,560
So I might as well just buy a pellet for fun.

1222
01:32:19,359 --> 01:32:21,239
Just have a ton of them in my inventory.

1223
01:32:22,119 --> 01:32:26,189
And speaking of which, okay, okay, okay.

1224
01:32:27,069 --> 01:32:29,470
I'm ready to dish out the pain.

1225
01:32:30,189 --> 01:32:45,229
I've never watched you until now and heard of you from Joel,

1226
01:32:45,229 --> 01:32:47,710
but you good sir have me moderately entertained.

1227
01:32:48,970 --> 01:32:49,449
Well, welcome.

1228
01:32:50,010 --> 01:32:53,100
Can we get a welcome in the chat for BenRick, please?

1229
01:32:53,739 --> 01:32:57,229
That's what we do to all new viewers.

1230
01:32:57,229 --> 01:32:58,350
We welcome them.

1231
01:32:58,350 --> 01:33:02,829
Let me look over here.

1232
01:33:05,340 --> 01:33:05,899
Moderately.

1233
01:33:06,380 --> 01:33:07,819
Moderately entertained.

1234
01:33:08,539 --> 01:33:09,560
Well, that's good.

1235
01:33:10,199 --> 01:33:14,439
Hey, first impressions are the most important thing.

1236
01:33:15,159 --> 01:33:22,359
I feel like I've given a bad first impression this stream.

1237
01:33:25,760 --> 01:33:31,159
Ooh, more divine confetti.

1238
01:33:35,260 --> 01:33:39,579
Ooh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1239
01:33:39,579 --> 01:33:40,060
Look at this.

1240
01:33:40,699 --> 01:33:42,220
Something over here.

1241
01:33:42,220 --> 01:33:42,779
Yes, there is.

1242
01:33:42,779 --> 01:33:43,180
Look it.

1243
01:33:45,930 --> 01:33:48,460
All right.

1244
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:55,060
Go.

1245
01:33:56,140 --> 01:33:56,939
Up, up, up, up, up.

1246
01:33:56,939 --> 01:33:57,819
Go up, up and jump.

1247
01:33:57,819 --> 01:33:58,779
Oh, jump.

1248
01:33:58,779 --> 01:34:00,220
Jump when he throws the toaster.

1249
01:34:00,220 --> 01:34:00,720
Quick.

1250
01:34:02,560 --> 01:34:03,920
Jesus, that saved me.

1251
01:34:03,920 --> 01:34:04,399
Did you see?

1252
01:34:04,399 --> 01:34:05,199
I've done that too.

1253
01:34:05,840 --> 01:34:06,800
What the fuck is that?

1254
01:34:08,619 --> 01:34:09,500
Was that the lightning?

1255
01:34:10,220 --> 01:34:11,420
What just crashed through the bridge?

1256
01:34:12,220 --> 01:34:14,569
What the hell was that?

1257
01:34:15,930 --> 01:34:17,289
What just went in the water?

1258
01:34:23,550 --> 01:34:26,090
Uh, okay.

1259
01:34:26,890 --> 01:34:32,189
I thought that was a lightning bolt.

1260
01:34:32,909 --> 01:34:34,359
I'm going to rest.

1261
01:34:35,770 --> 01:34:37,210
If I rest, the bridge will be back, right?

1262
01:34:40,350 --> 01:34:40,909
God damn it.

1263
01:34:40,909 --> 01:34:42,109
This is Mario World.

1264
01:34:42,109 --> 01:34:43,229
This is the fish from Mario.

1265
01:34:43,229 --> 01:34:44,189
It's the same colors too.

1266
01:34:44,909 --> 01:34:48,300
This is the gigantic fish from Super Mario World.

1267
01:34:48,300 --> 01:34:49,340
Level three, six.

1268
01:34:49,979 --> 01:35:00,989
Dear God.

1269
01:35:04,939 --> 01:35:06,699
Well, I made it across the bridge.

1270
01:35:07,340 --> 01:35:08,829
Is he just in there?

1271
01:35:10,960 --> 01:35:13,279
It's a water boss fight.

1272
01:35:13,279 --> 01:35:15,039
It's an underwater boss fight.

1273
01:35:15,039 --> 01:35:16,560
Oh, I'm not happy about this.

1274
01:35:17,840 --> 01:35:20,239
No, I'm so bad underwater in every game.

1275
01:35:21,439 --> 01:35:23,359
I'm terrible under pressure.

1276
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:25,520
Literally by the water pressure.

1277
01:35:25,520 --> 01:35:26,319
I can't do it.

1278
01:35:30,750 --> 01:35:31,550
Oh no.

1279
01:35:31,550 --> 01:35:32,750
I'm panicking already.

1280
01:35:32,750 --> 01:35:34,430
I'm like psyching myself up.

1281
01:36:08,680 --> 01:36:09,479
I want to get up there.

1282
01:36:10,199 --> 01:36:11,420
Because there's an item.

1283
01:36:16,760 --> 01:36:19,119
Can I make this jump from here?

1284
01:36:19,760 --> 01:36:20,880
I don't think I can make this jump.

1285
01:36:24,510 --> 01:36:25,869
Well, let's take care of this first.

1286
01:36:26,670 --> 01:36:33,489
Hey.

1287
01:36:34,029 --> 01:36:39,689
Aggressive.

1288
01:36:39,689 --> 01:36:40,250
Aggressive.

1289
01:36:40,250 --> 01:36:40,750
Aggressive.

1290
01:36:41,609 --> 01:36:46,760
Can I get up top?

1291
01:36:46,760 --> 01:36:47,260
Maybe.

1292
01:36:48,510 --> 01:36:49,229
I can go there.

1293
01:36:54,189 --> 01:36:55,310
And then over here.

1294
01:36:56,109 --> 01:36:56,909
Oh, come on.

1295
01:36:56,909 --> 01:36:57,409
No.

1296
01:36:59,390 --> 01:37:00,800
Wait.

1297
01:37:00,800 --> 01:37:01,199
Stop.

1298
01:37:01,199 --> 01:37:01,600
Stop.

1299
01:37:01,600 --> 01:37:01,920
Stop.

1300
01:37:01,920 --> 01:37:02,159
Stop.

1301
01:37:02,159 --> 01:37:03,039
Just where am I?

1302
01:37:03,600 --> 01:37:07,359
Where the fuck did I end up?

1303
01:37:09,130 --> 01:37:11,399
Uh, the hell?

1304
01:37:13,239 --> 01:37:13,880
I'm-

1305
01:37:13,880 --> 01:37:20,029
I can get back up.

1306
01:37:20,029 --> 01:37:21,229
I just heard a fucking burp.

1307
01:37:21,949 --> 01:37:23,359
That was a burp?

1308
01:37:29,739 --> 01:37:30,140
All right.

1309
01:37:30,140 --> 01:37:31,100
Let's get back over here.

1310
01:37:31,739 --> 01:37:37,399
All right.

1311
01:37:37,399 --> 01:37:39,069
Takes us down here.

1312
01:37:40,029 --> 01:37:43,369
God, I'm just gonna have to jump from here, right?

1313
01:37:44,170 --> 01:37:45,920
Am I gonna make this?

1314
01:37:46,560 --> 01:37:48,250
There's nowhere to grab.

1315
01:38:03,359 --> 01:38:04,560
Guys, I scream in real life.

1316
01:38:05,039 --> 01:38:07,159
Okay, when something like that happens.

1317
01:38:07,720 --> 01:38:09,289
Okay.

1318
01:38:09,289 --> 01:38:10,090
What am I doing here?

1319
01:38:10,090 --> 01:38:10,329
Just-

1320
01:38:10,329 --> 01:38:10,810
I forget it.

1321
01:38:10,810 --> 01:38:11,210
Forget it.

1322
01:38:11,210 --> 01:38:11,609
Forget it.

1323
01:38:11,609 --> 01:38:12,250
I don't even want it.

1324
01:38:13,439 --> 01:38:14,239
Yeah, I do.

1325
01:38:14,239 --> 01:38:14,640
No, I don't.

1326
01:38:14,640 --> 01:38:16,000
I don't even want it.

1327
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:19,689
I should change my title too.

1328
01:38:19,689 --> 01:38:21,930
When I get hit, I pretend to get hurt in the game.

1329
01:38:22,970 --> 01:38:25,229
Ha ha ha.

1330
01:38:26,189 --> 01:38:32,010
Did you see that?

1331
01:38:33,739 --> 01:38:35,979
What was with that spawn thing?

1332
01:38:35,979 --> 01:38:37,579
Did you see the spawns here?

1333
01:38:45,869 --> 01:38:46,189
What?

1334
01:38:47,789 --> 01:38:53,470
All right.

1335
01:38:53,470 --> 01:38:54,109
Guy over there.

1336
01:38:54,670 --> 01:38:58,539
I'm just trying to cover all my bases here, guys.

1337
01:39:05,079 --> 01:39:06,920
I don't want any bullshit to come kill me.

1338
01:39:06,920 --> 01:39:10,439
Somebody to fly and gonzo me or something.

1339
01:39:10,439 --> 01:39:11,239
We're taking care of-

1340
01:39:11,239 --> 01:39:12,439
Oh, I can get through from here.

1341
01:39:12,439 --> 01:39:12,760
I win.

1342
01:39:13,640 --> 01:39:23,550
Figured it out.

1343
01:39:23,550 --> 01:39:24,920
No, I can't.

1344
01:39:26,279 --> 01:39:26,920
Really?

1345
01:39:26,920 --> 01:39:28,439
There's no way for me to get any-

1346
01:39:28,600 --> 01:39:29,560
Grab anything from here?

1347
01:39:31,600 --> 01:39:32,640
How do I get this item?

1348
01:39:36,510 --> 01:39:37,550
How do I get that item?

1349
01:39:42,939 --> 01:39:43,659
There's a bridge.

1350
01:39:44,600 --> 01:39:45,720
I can't cross the bridge.

1351
01:39:46,359 --> 01:39:48,970
Do you not see the bridge broken in half?

1352
01:39:48,970 --> 01:39:49,930
I can't make that jump.

1353
01:39:52,939 --> 01:39:54,220
Cross the bridge?

1354
01:39:54,220 --> 01:39:55,500
That's a forehead comment, right?

1355
01:40:02,829 --> 01:40:03,949
Just cross the bridge.

1356
01:40:03,949 --> 01:40:04,670
Forehead.

1357
01:40:04,670 --> 01:40:05,310
It has to be.

1358
01:40:05,869 --> 01:40:07,470
There's no bridge.

1359
01:40:11,949 --> 01:40:13,069
Rebuild it.

1360
01:40:16,640 --> 01:40:17,039
All right.

1361
01:40:17,039 --> 01:40:18,399
Are you ready for this one?

1362
01:40:18,399 --> 01:40:18,880
No.

1363
01:40:18,880 --> 01:40:19,439
Just kidding.

1364
01:40:22,460 --> 01:40:23,260
I have a feeling.

1365
01:40:23,739 --> 01:40:27,880
Let's just keep moving.

1366
01:40:27,880 --> 01:40:28,359
Whatever.

1367
01:40:28,359 --> 01:40:29,800
That item is probably the best item in the game,

1368
01:40:29,800 --> 01:40:30,600
and I'm not going to get it.

1369
01:40:31,479 --> 01:40:34,960
Whatever.

1370
01:40:42,539 --> 01:40:44,380
There's an equally as cool item down here.

1371
01:40:48,140 --> 01:40:48,460
Wait.

1372
01:40:51,199 --> 01:40:52,960
No secret waterfall entrance?

1373
01:40:53,680 --> 01:40:55,869
Is there?

1374
01:40:55,869 --> 01:41:04,170
Okay.

1375
01:41:04,170 --> 01:41:04,649
What about-

1376
01:41:04,649 --> 01:41:05,130
Let me just check.

1377
01:41:05,770 --> 01:41:07,479
Okay.

1378
01:41:07,479 --> 01:41:08,680
I can go up from there.

1379
01:41:09,560 --> 01:41:12,189
I want to get that, whatever it is, though.

1380
01:41:12,989 --> 01:41:14,430
And then I can get back up, right?

1381
01:41:15,229 --> 01:41:19,399
Is that a water dog?

1382
01:41:20,380 --> 01:41:21,260
Two water dogs.

1383
01:41:24,590 --> 01:41:26,239
Three water dogs.

1384
01:41:26,239 --> 01:41:27,119
Four water dogs?

1385
01:41:29,289 --> 01:41:29,850
Oh, fuck!

1386
01:41:30,090 --> 01:41:31,289
It's an electricity dog!

1387
01:41:31,850 --> 01:41:32,409
Kill it quick.

1388
01:41:33,369 --> 01:41:34,329
Oh, my god.

1389
01:41:36,489 --> 01:41:37,850
Wouldn't that kill the dog?

1390
01:41:38,729 --> 01:41:39,850
It would kill the dog.

1391
01:41:40,909 --> 01:41:42,350
Um, where?

1392
01:41:43,659 --> 01:41:44,220
Where are-

1393
01:41:44,220 --> 01:41:44,779
Where?

1394
01:41:52,779 --> 01:41:54,619
Just because you have electricity coming out of you

1395
01:41:54,619 --> 01:41:56,460
doesn't mean you're immune to electricity.

1396
01:41:57,260 --> 01:41:57,579
Okay?

1397
01:41:58,380 --> 01:42:03,239
That was lucky.

1398
01:42:03,960 --> 01:42:05,340
Don't you know?

1399
01:42:05,340 --> 01:42:07,979
Even when Pikachu gets struck by lightning,

1400
01:42:07,979 --> 01:42:09,899
it still does like 5% damage.

1401
01:42:10,699 --> 01:42:11,899
It's just not very effective.

1402
01:42:12,539 --> 01:42:13,560
It still hurts.

1403
01:42:16,960 --> 01:42:17,279
Even-

1404
01:42:17,279 --> 01:42:20,640
Okay, if you put yourself in a suit of armor

1405
01:42:21,720 --> 01:42:23,239
and then you jumped in front of a train,

1406
01:42:24,199 --> 01:42:24,920
you're gonna be fine.

1407
01:42:24,920 --> 01:42:25,800
It's gonna hurt, though.

1408
01:42:33,340 --> 01:42:33,979
That was a baby.

1409
01:42:35,880 --> 01:42:42,220
No, no, no!

1410
01:42:42,220 --> 01:42:43,340
No, no, no!

1411
01:42:43,340 --> 01:42:44,380
No, no, no!

1412
01:42:44,380 --> 01:42:45,420
Oh, no!

1413
01:42:45,420 --> 01:42:46,460
Oh, no!

1414
01:42:46,460 --> 01:42:51,359
Nooooooooooooo!

1415
01:42:51,359 --> 01:42:53,079
He has a laser!

1416
01:42:56,560 --> 01:42:58,159
The laser can shoot through the wall!

1417
01:42:59,039 --> 01:43:01,920
He has a laser that shoots through walls.

1418
01:43:13,609 --> 01:43:14,569
Fuck that.

1419
01:43:14,649 --> 01:43:15,850
I don't want to fight you.

1420
01:43:15,850 --> 01:43:16,329
I don't care.

1421
01:43:18,560 --> 01:43:19,520
Okay, get me up.

1422
01:43:19,520 --> 01:43:20,000
Jump!

1423
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:20,640
Grab it!

1424
01:43:20,640 --> 01:43:20,880
No!

1425
01:43:22,279 --> 01:43:23,560
No, get me away!

1426
01:43:23,560 --> 01:43:25,079
Is he gonna shoot me through the wall?

1427
01:43:25,079 --> 01:43:27,640
How far does his, like, smite ultimate beam go?

1428
01:43:29,050 --> 01:43:29,550
Ugh!

1429
01:43:30,989 --> 01:43:31,710
Okay.

1430
01:43:31,710 --> 01:43:32,270
We're alright.

1431
01:43:40,859 --> 01:43:41,420
Jesus.

1432
01:43:42,970 --> 01:43:46,029
Um, I think I gotta go into that building.

1433
01:43:46,670 --> 01:43:47,630
If I were taking a guess.

1434
01:43:48,270 --> 01:43:51,850
Could deal with these, too.

1435
01:43:53,789 --> 01:43:54,750
I still have plenty of health.

1436
01:43:54,750 --> 01:43:55,710
I got out of there quick.

1437
01:43:55,710 --> 01:43:56,430
That was lucky.

1438
01:43:56,989 --> 01:44:01,340
Let me deal with one of these.

1439
01:44:01,420 --> 01:44:02,619
Yeah, let's...

1440
01:44:02,619 --> 01:44:03,260
Oh, man.

1441
01:44:03,260 --> 01:44:03,979
That's too many.

1442
01:44:07,210 --> 01:44:07,529
Uh...

1443
01:44:08,250 --> 01:44:09,960
What's this way?

1444
01:44:10,600 --> 01:44:15,289
I think I have to.

1445
01:44:16,569 --> 01:44:17,210
I don't...

1446
01:44:17,210 --> 01:44:17,609
I don't know.

1447
01:44:22,800 --> 01:44:23,199
Fuck it.

1448
01:44:33,359 --> 01:44:35,920
Okay, watch out for the guy playing soccer!

1449
01:44:35,920 --> 01:44:37,279
Alright, where do I go?

1450
01:44:37,279 --> 01:44:37,920
Where do I go?

1451
01:44:38,800 --> 01:44:39,439
Where do I go?

1452
01:44:40,909 --> 01:44:41,789
Where's progression?

1453
01:44:44,170 --> 01:44:45,449
I think I'm going over this way.

1454
01:44:46,250 --> 01:44:47,529
Yep, I found progression.

1455
01:44:48,600 --> 01:44:50,039
There's no way I can do that.

1456
01:44:50,039 --> 01:44:50,439
I'm sorry.

1457
01:44:50,439 --> 01:44:51,079
I'm not gonna...

1458
01:44:51,079 --> 01:44:52,279
I'm not stupid.

1459
01:44:52,279 --> 01:45:02,920
He's a lightning dog.

1460
01:45:03,880 --> 01:45:05,319
Be prepared!

1461
01:45:05,319 --> 01:45:06,199
Be prepared for the lightning!

1462
01:45:11,579 --> 01:45:15,840
Progression.

1463
01:45:18,060 --> 01:45:26,590
Litecoin is down like seven or eight hundred percent since last year.

1464
01:45:30,720 --> 01:45:32,079
More electricity dogs.

1465
01:45:45,289 --> 01:45:46,409
That's a new enemy there.

1466
01:45:46,409 --> 01:45:47,770
That's a big guy.

1467
01:45:47,770 --> 01:45:49,289
It's a big bearded octopus person.

1468
01:45:51,439 --> 01:45:51,760
Um...

1469
01:46:05,439 --> 01:46:09,359
Does he have two bars?

1470
01:46:09,359 --> 01:46:09,680
That's a...

1471
01:46:09,680 --> 01:46:13,069
Is that a mini boss or is that an NPC?

1472
01:46:13,069 --> 01:46:13,949
I don't know.

1473
01:46:13,949 --> 01:46:15,720
I'm gonna keep going around this way.

1474
01:46:15,720 --> 01:46:16,279
I'm gonna progress.

1475
01:46:18,039 --> 01:46:19,239
Go fight it just to hold on.

1476
01:46:19,960 --> 01:46:21,399
I'm not gonna go fight that right now.

1477
01:46:21,399 --> 01:46:22,520
I need a new stone.

1478
01:46:24,329 --> 01:46:26,170
If I die, I have to go all the way.

1479
01:46:26,170 --> 01:46:28,090
You can't even see how far away I have to go.

1480
01:46:28,090 --> 01:46:28,729
All the way down there.

1481
01:46:31,710 --> 01:46:33,710
This is like 35 minutes of progression.

1482
01:46:34,859 --> 01:46:35,819
I ain't gonna blow this.

1483
01:46:48,939 --> 01:46:51,340
Oh, what the fuck are you talking about, man?

1484
01:46:51,340 --> 01:46:52,829
Are you serious?

1485
01:46:53,470 --> 01:46:54,569
There's another one.

1486
01:46:56,039 --> 01:46:58,279
Why is there another one here?

1487
01:46:58,279 --> 01:46:59,239
Do I have to go?

1488
01:47:02,720 --> 01:47:03,039
I...

1489
01:47:03,039 --> 01:47:03,520
I don't...

1490
01:47:03,520 --> 01:47:04,399
I don't believe it.

1491
01:47:04,399 --> 01:47:05,439
I'm not going over there.

1492
01:47:06,239 --> 01:47:06,880
I have to though.

1493
01:47:07,680 --> 01:47:08,439
I have to...

1494
01:47:11,520 --> 01:47:12,560
That's the same one?

1495
01:47:13,359 --> 01:47:14,079
No, it's not.

1496
01:47:14,880 --> 01:47:15,199
There was...

1497
01:47:15,199 --> 01:47:16,560
The other one was down that way.

1498
01:47:17,359 --> 01:47:19,159
Is there any way I can go up from there?

1499
01:47:19,159 --> 01:47:19,800
I just need to look.

1500
01:47:21,020 --> 01:47:21,659
I think I can.

1501
01:47:22,560 --> 01:47:22,880
Dodge.

1502
01:47:22,880 --> 01:47:23,199
I could...

1503
01:47:23,199 --> 01:47:23,439
I have to...

1504
01:47:23,439 --> 01:47:24,800
Dodges have to be on point right now.

1505
01:47:31,979 --> 01:47:33,500
Yeah, call that one in sick.

1506
01:47:37,159 --> 01:47:37,720
Yeah.

1507
01:47:37,720 --> 01:47:38,119
Yeah.

1508
01:47:38,119 --> 01:47:38,439
Oh.

1509
01:47:41,479 --> 01:47:42,600
What am I doing?

1510
01:47:43,159 --> 01:47:44,199
Hope this is not a bad idea.

1511
01:47:45,500 --> 01:47:45,819
Um...

1512
01:47:49,949 --> 01:47:50,189
Uh...

1513
01:47:52,119 --> 01:47:52,439
Uh...

1514
01:47:52,439 --> 01:47:52,600
Uh...

1515
01:47:54,270 --> 01:47:54,670
Um...

1516
01:47:55,390 --> 01:47:56,670
I'm actually terrified.

1517
01:47:57,390 --> 01:48:04,619
Is there a beach?

1518
01:48:04,619 --> 01:48:05,100
A house?

1519
01:48:07,420 --> 01:48:07,819
Come on.

1520
01:48:07,819 --> 01:48:08,859
Give me a thing to grab.

1521
01:48:10,859 --> 01:48:11,899
Come on, please.

1522
01:48:13,020 --> 01:48:14,220
No, don't do it like this.

1523
01:48:14,220 --> 01:48:15,180
Don't do it like this.

1524
01:48:16,140 --> 01:48:17,550
Something to grab.

1525
01:48:19,039 --> 01:48:19,439
I can't...

1526
01:48:19,439 --> 01:48:20,239
Nothing to grab?

1527
01:48:21,819 --> 01:48:22,699
Oh, come on.

1528
01:48:23,420 --> 01:48:24,380
You got to be kidding me.

1529
01:48:24,380 --> 01:48:25,420
Not like this, man.

1530
01:48:28,409 --> 01:48:29,050
I can make it.

1531
01:48:29,689 --> 01:48:32,539
I can make it.

1532
01:49:06,109 --> 01:49:07,210
Fuck.

1533
01:49:07,210 --> 01:49:07,529
Uh...

1534
01:49:10,909 --> 01:49:11,789
Oh, no.

1535
01:49:12,829 --> 01:49:13,789
Kill that guy first.

1536
01:49:13,789 --> 01:49:15,069
I don't even know where that guy is.

1537
01:49:15,069 --> 01:49:15,949
He's like up here.

1538
01:49:33,560 --> 01:49:35,399
I just killed probably the least dangerous guy.

1539
01:49:49,260 --> 01:49:51,020
He just double tapped me.

1540
01:49:51,020 --> 01:49:52,619
No, that's not fair.

1541
01:49:53,739 --> 01:49:56,699
I was on the ground and it bounced on my head.

1542
01:49:58,060 --> 01:49:58,380
What?

1543
01:49:59,340 --> 01:50:00,220
Oh, fuck off.

1544
01:50:00,779 --> 01:50:01,579
Fuck off with this.

1545
01:50:01,579 --> 01:50:02,220
I'm out of here.

1546
01:50:04,640 --> 01:50:05,439
There's no way...

1547
01:50:05,439 --> 01:50:06,479
I don't know where to go.

1548
01:50:07,039 --> 01:50:08,000
There's no way to go.

1549
01:50:12,029 --> 01:50:15,199
There's an item.

1550
01:50:15,199 --> 01:50:18,720
Oh, shit.

1551
01:50:18,720 --> 01:50:19,439
There's two items.

1552
01:50:19,439 --> 01:50:19,760
Nice.

1553
01:50:20,319 --> 01:50:36,170
And there's that guy over here, too.

1554
01:50:44,760 --> 01:50:46,520
There's got to be one path to get back...

1555
01:50:46,520 --> 01:50:47,399
To get up this way.

1556
01:50:49,180 --> 01:50:49,420
Right?

1557
01:50:49,420 --> 01:50:49,739
Like, look.

1558
01:50:49,739 --> 01:50:50,779
It's over there.

1559
01:50:50,779 --> 01:50:52,300
I can't get up from here.

1560
01:50:58,760 --> 01:51:00,039
There's the bad guy.

1561
01:51:00,039 --> 01:51:02,039
It appears as an illusion.

1562
01:51:02,760 --> 01:51:04,199
What about behind the waterfall?

1563
01:51:04,199 --> 01:51:04,840
I'm going for it.

1564
01:51:04,840 --> 01:51:05,159
Let's see.

1565
01:51:05,960 --> 01:51:06,199
Nope.

1566
01:51:09,550 --> 01:51:10,510
That ain't going to happen.

1567
01:51:10,510 --> 01:51:11,789
That just ain't going to happen.

1568
01:51:11,789 --> 01:51:13,529
That's not going to happen.

1569
01:51:13,529 --> 01:51:23,720
It's just that ain't going to happen.

1570
01:51:24,359 --> 01:51:25,479
I have to get the terror potion.

1571
01:51:25,479 --> 01:51:26,760
Anybody that has the terror buildup

1572
01:51:26,760 --> 01:51:28,520
that takes five seconds for the terror to kill you?

1573
01:51:30,380 --> 01:51:31,420
You've got to get confetti

1574
01:51:31,420 --> 01:51:33,340
and you have to get the terror potion shit.

1575
01:51:50,750 --> 01:51:51,949
You've got to be fucking kidding me.

1576
01:51:52,829 --> 01:51:54,590
Did you really just hit me from that far away?

1577
01:51:55,390 --> 01:51:56,350
What game is this?

1578
01:51:57,529 --> 01:51:58,970
What video game is this?

1579
01:52:01,020 --> 01:52:03,260
I was a homing missile from across the game.

1580
01:52:03,260 --> 01:52:05,100
What game is this?

1581
01:52:24,300 --> 01:52:25,420
Kill the streamer.

1582
01:52:26,140 --> 01:52:39,039
I just don't...

1583
01:52:39,039 --> 01:52:40,560
I'm maybe on the roof?

1584
01:52:41,439 --> 01:52:42,079
Like, up here?

1585
01:52:43,119 --> 01:52:44,319
I got from behind.

1586
01:52:47,020 --> 01:52:47,979
Oh my god.

1587
01:52:48,859 --> 01:52:49,359
Why?

1588
01:52:50,380 --> 01:52:50,880
Why?

1589
01:52:55,119 --> 01:52:56,880
I have to go all the way around this.

1590
01:53:01,899 --> 01:53:03,659
I'm trying to just skip.

1591
01:53:03,659 --> 01:53:04,859
Thanks for the unforeseen aid.

1592
01:53:05,420 --> 01:53:06,140
Appreciate it.

1593
01:53:06,140 --> 01:53:06,699
No, fuck it.

1594
01:53:06,699 --> 01:53:07,180
I'm just gone.

1595
01:53:10,479 --> 01:53:10,979
Go.

1596
01:53:11,930 --> 01:53:12,430
Go.

1597
01:53:21,899 --> 01:53:22,859
Fuck off.

1598
01:53:22,859 --> 01:53:25,659
Can I make this from here?

1599
01:53:28,010 --> 01:53:28,489
I don't know.

1600
01:53:28,489 --> 01:53:28,989
Let me try.

1601
01:53:40,359 --> 01:53:41,640
What's the ultimate goal?

1602
01:53:42,810 --> 01:53:44,409
To go back around this way?

1603
01:53:45,210 --> 01:53:53,260
Like, up there?

1604
01:53:53,260 --> 01:53:54,140
But I...

1605
01:53:54,140 --> 01:53:55,579
How the fuck do I get over there?

1606
01:53:55,579 --> 01:54:21,899
I can grab it from here, but there's no grabbing point.

1607
01:54:23,020 --> 01:54:24,539
Like, underneath and then up?

1608
01:54:24,539 --> 01:54:25,819
That's kind of what I did before.

1609
01:54:26,859 --> 01:54:28,539
Because there's no grabbing point here.

1610
01:54:57,739 --> 01:54:58,460
Oh, thank god.

1611
01:54:59,020 --> 01:55:00,329
I found it.

1612
01:55:00,329 --> 01:55:00,829
Okay.

1613
01:55:00,829 --> 01:55:02,010
Slow down, slow down, slow down.

1614
01:55:02,569 --> 01:55:09,659
There's a door.

1615
01:55:09,659 --> 01:55:10,159
Come.

1616
01:55:10,939 --> 01:55:11,439
Who?

1617
01:55:21,770 --> 01:55:22,970
No, I don't dare.

1618
01:55:22,970 --> 01:55:27,149
Of course not.

1619
01:55:27,149 --> 01:55:27,649
Ah.

1620
01:55:33,500 --> 01:55:35,579
Everybody's still alive, so this is bad.

1621
01:55:36,220 --> 01:55:48,319
I'll take one at a time.

1622
01:55:50,010 --> 01:55:50,649
Come on, let's go.

1623
01:55:50,649 --> 01:55:50,970
Fight.

1624
01:55:50,970 --> 01:55:51,930
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

1625
01:55:51,930 --> 01:55:53,289
Come on, I can take two.

1626
01:55:53,289 --> 01:55:54,170
I've done it before.

1627
01:55:54,170 --> 01:55:54,970
I'm scum good.

1628
01:56:10,750 --> 01:56:11,710
You too, come on.

1629
01:56:11,710 --> 01:56:26,779
Goff.

1630
01:56:35,119 --> 01:56:37,920
Anybody else up here?

1631
01:56:37,920 --> 01:56:39,520
Anybody, anybody, anybody?

1632
01:56:39,520 --> 01:56:43,819
I just don't want to have a problem later.

1633
01:56:49,880 --> 01:56:52,600
Video games, video games, video games, video games, video games.

1634
01:56:52,600 --> 01:56:54,810
All right, maybe I shouldn't have any more caffeine.

1635
01:57:01,279 --> 01:57:05,210
What's wrong with you?

1636
01:57:05,210 --> 01:57:06,329
I'm just happy.

1637
01:57:06,329 --> 01:57:07,369
I'm just having a good time.

1638
01:57:09,449 --> 01:57:11,529
Now, this is where I'm going to make a major mistake.

1639
01:57:13,600 --> 01:57:15,920
Can I jump from here and grab something over there?

1640
01:57:20,319 --> 01:57:21,439
No, I'm going to go that way.

1641
01:57:26,649 --> 01:57:28,569
Because there's a place I haven't gone down there.

1642
01:57:29,449 --> 01:57:31,100
And we're going to do it.

1643
01:57:31,100 --> 01:57:32,539
Don't get stuck in a wall.

1644
01:57:33,880 --> 01:57:35,399
I'm going to do it the correct way,

1645
01:57:35,399 --> 01:57:38,199
which is like stuff my body in here

1646
01:57:38,199 --> 01:57:39,319
and glitch into the wall

1647
01:57:39,319 --> 01:57:41,159
and to a point where I can fall down those stairs.

1648
01:57:44,779 --> 01:57:46,460
I fucking, I hate myself so much.

1649
01:57:47,020 --> 01:57:48,220
I fucking can't believe it.

1650
01:57:48,220 --> 01:57:49,500
There's an invisible wall there.

1651
01:57:49,500 --> 01:57:50,380
I can't fucking believe it.

1652
01:57:50,380 --> 01:57:51,100
I cannot believe it.

1653
01:57:51,100 --> 01:57:52,060
I can't believe it.

1654
01:57:52,060 --> 01:57:53,340
I can't believe it.

1655
01:57:53,340 --> 01:57:59,000
I can't fucking believe it.

1656
01:57:59,960 --> 01:58:07,489
Skip.

1657
01:58:09,550 --> 01:58:11,229
I'm so disappointed in myself.

1658
01:58:13,310 --> 01:58:14,430
I'm so disappointed.

1659
01:58:15,069 --> 01:58:27,479
Oh, the disappointment is unreal down here.

1660
01:58:27,479 --> 01:58:29,560
Like typically I would be mad about

1661
01:58:29,560 --> 01:58:31,479
like the bad grade I got on my report card.

1662
01:58:32,279 --> 01:58:33,399
None of my parents would be.

1663
01:58:34,119 --> 01:58:36,199
My parents would be upset with what I just brought home.

1664
01:58:36,199 --> 01:58:38,199
I'm actually more upset than they are.

1665
01:58:39,079 --> 01:58:50,569
Why does that keep happening?

1666
01:58:50,569 --> 01:58:51,289
All right, let's go.

1667
01:58:51,930 --> 01:59:02,250
Line of sight.

1668
01:59:02,250 --> 01:59:03,770
I can't hit anything through a goddamn wall.

1669
01:59:23,159 --> 01:59:23,659
Stupid.

1670
01:59:25,609 --> 01:59:26,729
You're almost as dumb as me.

1671
01:59:36,520 --> 01:59:37,479
There's an idol right there.

1672
01:59:52,189 --> 01:59:53,069
Is this a mini boss?

1673
01:59:54,079 --> 01:59:54,800
Target him so I...

1674
01:59:54,800 --> 01:59:55,760
No, it's not a mini boss.

1675
01:59:56,640 --> 01:59:59,199
I just have to deal with this.

1676
01:59:59,199 --> 01:59:59,840
Sit down.

1677
01:59:59,840 --> 02:00:00,640
Don't stand up.

1678
02:00:00,640 --> 02:00:01,140
Hey, guy.

1679
02:00:34,680 --> 02:00:36,279
The nightmare is over.

1680
02:00:36,279 --> 02:00:36,680
For now.

1681
02:00:46,250 --> 02:00:46,890
For now.

1682
02:00:46,890 --> 02:00:48,640
How much money do I have?

1683
02:00:48,640 --> 02:00:49,520
I got a lot of money.

1684
02:00:53,390 --> 02:00:55,229
I'm going back and buying a gift.

1685
02:00:55,229 --> 02:00:56,029
What the hell they are.

1686
02:01:00,539 --> 02:01:01,100
500...

1687
02:01:01,100 --> 02:01:02,140
It's a lot of money in this game.

1688
02:01:12,640 --> 02:01:15,949
You guys don't think 500 dollars is a lot of money?

1689
02:01:15,949 --> 02:01:17,069
What are you talking about?

1690
02:01:17,630 --> 02:01:18,590
Buy 50.

1691
02:01:18,590 --> 02:01:20,430
Oh, shit.

1692
02:01:20,430 --> 02:01:21,869
Okay, I'll sell a couple of dumb things.

1693
02:01:26,380 --> 02:01:30,250
Where's my large amount of ashes?

1694
02:01:30,250 --> 02:01:31,050
Yeah, whatever.

1695
02:01:31,529 --> 02:01:40,539
Next time.

1696
02:01:45,340 --> 02:01:45,819
Continue.

1697
02:01:50,479 --> 02:01:52,319
Great Sakura.

1698
02:01:52,319 --> 02:02:05,319
Jerma's afraid of headless?

1699
02:02:05,319 --> 02:02:05,720
Yeah, I am.

1700
02:02:07,550 --> 02:02:08,670
But I can admit that.

1701
02:02:09,390 --> 02:02:10,590
I'm terrified of finding that.

1702
02:02:10,590 --> 02:02:12,270
I'm terrified of finding any of the magical people.

1703
02:02:14,909 --> 02:02:16,510
Let me just try to kill this guy for fun.

1704
02:02:17,069 --> 02:02:29,560
Dragon...

1705
02:02:29,560 --> 02:02:30,279
Oh, Gatsaki.

1706
02:02:30,920 --> 02:02:37,069
That didn't hit him.

1707
02:02:38,430 --> 02:02:52,140
That's not gonna work.

1708
02:02:52,140 --> 02:02:54,590
Somebody else is hitting him now.

1709
02:02:55,229 --> 02:02:56,430
That was a bad idea.

1710
02:02:56,430 --> 02:02:57,550
Um, that was fun.

1711
02:02:57,550 --> 02:02:58,430
I'm gonna go this way now.

1712
02:02:59,840 --> 02:03:01,279
Oh, there's a mini boss.

1713
02:03:02,329 --> 02:03:02,890
Under pressure.

1714
02:03:02,890 --> 02:03:03,930
That's how I work.

1715
02:03:03,930 --> 02:03:04,409
What is that?

1716
02:03:05,210 --> 02:03:06,640
Okay, he kicks balls.

1717
02:03:07,600 --> 02:03:08,479
That's a lightning ball.

1718
02:03:08,479 --> 02:03:08,800
I got...

1719
02:03:08,800 --> 02:03:10,880
Okay, I got these idiots over here like fighting me.

1720
02:03:10,880 --> 02:03:11,279
Just die.

1721
02:03:12,319 --> 02:03:15,579
Like, I've got five people throwing rocks at me from behind me.

1722
02:03:19,689 --> 02:03:20,569
Come on.

1723
02:03:20,569 --> 02:03:26,460
Let's go.

1724
02:03:26,460 --> 02:03:27,020
You and me.

1725
02:03:27,020 --> 02:03:27,899
Lightning balls?

1726
02:03:27,899 --> 02:03:28,399
Fine.

1727
02:03:29,100 --> 02:03:30,220
Just get up on him right now.

1728
02:03:33,100 --> 02:03:33,819
But that hit me.

1729
02:03:37,039 --> 02:03:37,600
That's okay.

1730
02:03:37,600 --> 02:03:38,800
You have to long wind up.

1731
02:03:39,520 --> 02:03:44,750
Long is even longer than that.

1732
02:03:51,100 --> 02:03:51,579
Wait, didn't I...

1733
02:03:51,579 --> 02:03:53,340
Don't I have a move to stop that from happening?

1734
02:03:53,340 --> 02:03:53,819
Okay, what...

1735
02:03:54,460 --> 02:03:58,039
Don't I...

1736
02:03:58,039 --> 02:03:59,159
I thought I could, like...

1737
02:03:59,159 --> 02:04:03,560
Oh, that guy...

1738
02:04:03,560 --> 02:04:04,039
You suck.

1739
02:04:04,680 --> 02:04:07,149
I'm gonna pray for that, though.

1740
02:04:07,869 --> 02:04:11,420
Yeah, it's attack while you're in the air.

1741
02:04:11,420 --> 02:04:11,979
Don't just...

1742
02:04:11,979 --> 02:04:13,100
Fucking my god.

1743
02:04:13,100 --> 02:04:14,060
I know how to do it.

1744
02:04:14,060 --> 02:04:15,739
You don't have to, like, demonstrate.

1745
02:04:16,380 --> 02:04:17,340
Oh, thank god.

1746
02:04:18,060 --> 02:04:18,829
Oh, yeah.

1747
02:04:18,829 --> 02:04:19,310
At first sight.

1748
02:04:19,310 --> 02:04:19,869
At first speed.

1749
02:04:19,869 --> 02:04:20,510
At first sound.

1750
02:04:21,069 --> 02:04:25,850
I gotta breathe.

1751
02:04:39,159 --> 02:04:39,479
Nice.

1752
02:04:39,479 --> 02:04:40,119
Thousand bucks.

1753
02:04:40,680 --> 02:04:41,479
All right.

1754
02:04:41,479 --> 02:04:42,760
There's no more electricity.

1755
02:04:43,920 --> 02:04:44,319
Except that...

1756
02:04:44,319 --> 02:04:45,279
Is that guy electricity?

1757
02:04:47,840 --> 02:04:48,479
Electricity?

1758
02:04:48,479 --> 02:04:48,800
Gone.

1759
02:04:49,520 --> 02:04:52,569
I gotta kill this guy.

1760
02:04:55,550 --> 02:04:56,829
He's facing the other way.

1761
02:04:56,829 --> 02:05:01,229
You don't even know I'm here.

1762
02:05:09,130 --> 02:05:09,369
Oh.

1763
02:05:10,329 --> 02:05:11,369
It's this lady.

1764
02:05:11,369 --> 02:05:18,539
I was supposed to backstab this lady.

1765
02:05:28,909 --> 02:05:30,109
You got these great directions.

1766
02:05:30,989 --> 02:05:36,359
Large cave.

1767
02:05:42,750 --> 02:05:43,069
No.

1768
02:05:45,180 --> 02:05:45,899
Here it comes.

1769
02:05:45,899 --> 02:05:47,979
I've been trying to avoid having to do this.

1770
02:05:52,189 --> 02:05:53,390
Open the door to the palace.

1771
02:05:54,350 --> 02:05:58,119
It's under water and it's through a cave that's down here under the water.

1772
02:05:59,000 --> 02:06:01,149
And by the way, fight the fish boss.

1773
02:06:08,920 --> 02:06:10,359
Well, it begins.

1774
02:06:12,859 --> 02:06:14,060
See you guys in, like, four hours.

1775
02:06:14,619 --> 02:06:29,680
Lump of wax.

1776
02:06:30,810 --> 02:06:31,369
Okay.

1777
02:06:31,369 --> 02:06:37,680
So, is the palace this way or is the palace under here?

1778
02:06:38,399 --> 02:06:40,239
Let's just take a look under water.

1779
02:06:40,960 --> 02:06:47,500
It's over here.

1780
02:06:47,579 --> 02:06:48,699
The great carp.

1781
02:06:48,699 --> 02:06:51,260
Ah, I'm not an underwater boss.

1782
02:06:52,760 --> 02:06:54,920
No, they can't do it to us like this.

1783
02:06:54,920 --> 02:06:56,600
They can't do this to us like this.

1784
02:07:12,239 --> 02:07:13,279
God damn it.

1785
02:07:15,739 --> 02:07:17,550
Fuck.

1786
02:07:17,550 --> 02:07:18,989
It's a giant goldfish.

1787
02:07:19,630 --> 02:07:32,350
Whatever this is, just let me have it.

1788
02:07:32,350 --> 02:07:32,989
Coin purse.

1789
02:07:33,710 --> 02:07:35,470
Oh my God.

1790
02:07:39,390 --> 02:07:39,869
He's dead?

1791
02:07:40,430 --> 02:07:40,909
He's dead.

1792
02:07:41,720 --> 02:07:42,680
He's dead.

1793
02:07:42,680 --> 02:07:43,319
I killed him.

1794
02:07:44,699 --> 02:07:54,319
I killed him.

1795
02:07:54,319 --> 02:07:58,479
He rolled over like he was in somebody's tank.

1796
02:07:59,039 --> 02:07:59,359
What?

1797
02:08:01,359 --> 02:08:04,010
Why did he do that?

1798
02:08:04,729 --> 02:08:06,670
Just get me out.

1799
02:08:14,350 --> 02:08:15,840
Am I safe in here?

1800
02:08:16,479 --> 02:08:19,520
But where is the...

1801
02:08:19,520 --> 02:08:20,000
How do I get...

1802
02:08:20,640 --> 02:08:23,760
Is there a hole up there?

1803
02:08:23,760 --> 02:08:33,840
Oh my God.

1804
02:08:33,840 --> 02:08:34,960
Jeremy, get in the hole, please.

1805
02:08:42,140 --> 02:08:52,109
He seriously rolled over like he was dead.

1806
02:08:52,109 --> 02:08:53,550
Like that was his final breath.

1807
02:08:54,270 --> 02:09:06,510
I made it.

1808
02:09:06,510 --> 02:09:09,390
He smashed his head into a rock.

1809
02:09:13,470 --> 02:09:14,750
His last dash.

1810
02:09:15,949 --> 02:09:17,229
That's so funny.

1811
02:09:17,229 --> 02:09:18,510
I wish that were the case.

1812
02:09:22,119 --> 02:09:24,520
Well, waterfall.

1813
02:09:25,079 --> 02:09:25,869
I guess.

1814
02:09:26,430 --> 02:09:29,739
What's up here?

1815
02:09:34,159 --> 02:09:35,479
Wait, I'm gonna...

1816
02:09:35,479 --> 02:09:36,359
Let me examine first.

1817
02:09:36,920 --> 02:09:39,100
You never know.

1818
02:09:39,100 --> 02:09:39,979
There might be something hidden.

1819
02:09:45,600 --> 02:09:46,079
No.

1820
02:09:46,079 --> 02:09:46,960
It was worth a shot.

1821
02:09:55,039 --> 02:09:55,680
Up.

1822
02:09:55,680 --> 02:10:01,630
Hmm.

1823
02:10:01,630 --> 02:10:03,640
I think I found the back door to the palace.

1824
02:10:07,800 --> 02:10:09,960
This really is a pretty, pretty, pretty zone.

1825
02:10:10,600 --> 02:10:12,760
The fish.

1826
02:10:12,760 --> 02:10:13,560
That fish is cool.

1827
02:10:14,359 --> 02:10:16,909
Thank God I don't have to fight it right now.

1828
02:10:17,630 --> 02:10:20,300
Hopefully it's just like the snake from earlier.

1829
02:10:20,300 --> 02:10:22,699
And it's just a giant annoying obstacle.

1830
02:10:23,420 --> 02:10:32,920
I'm missing a ton of hidden shit.

1831
02:10:32,920 --> 02:10:36,199
Yeah, look, I can go back there any time I want.

1832
02:10:36,840 --> 02:10:38,520
I have a new sculpture here.

1833
02:10:39,579 --> 02:10:40,300
I am safe.

1834
02:10:54,680 --> 02:10:57,420
Let's see what's in here.

1835
02:11:01,279 --> 02:11:02,880
This is a room full of those people.

1836
02:11:03,680 --> 02:11:08,399
I'm getting bloodborne vibes from these people.

1837
02:11:15,640 --> 02:11:16,359
Door.

1838
02:11:16,359 --> 02:11:24,810
Where's your flute?

1839
02:11:24,810 --> 02:11:33,720
I have flutes.

1840
02:11:36,779 --> 02:11:38,539
Well, what's behind the door?

1841
02:11:38,539 --> 02:11:39,340
Is this a shortcut?

1842
02:11:46,279 --> 02:11:48,199
Yes, this is the door from earlier.

1843
02:11:49,479 --> 02:11:51,000
But this is not really a shortcut.

1844
02:11:51,239 --> 02:11:55,420
Because this, I just had an idol right here.

1845
02:11:56,060 --> 02:11:56,859
You know what I mean?

1846
02:11:56,859 --> 02:12:04,750
Why would I use that shortcut?

1847
02:12:05,470 --> 02:12:06,270
That's a chest.

1848
02:12:12,489 --> 02:12:13,609
It's like a coffin.

1849
02:12:13,609 --> 02:12:15,229
Is there a dead body in here?

1850
02:12:16,189 --> 02:12:16,989
Bunch of dead coins.

1851
02:12:18,430 --> 02:12:20,880
Well, I know I'm going back right now.

1852
02:12:21,680 --> 02:12:22,880
Oh, the lady wanted me to open that.

1853
02:12:22,880 --> 02:12:26,539
Right, okay.

1854
02:12:26,539 --> 02:12:27,659
What the hell is this?

1855
02:12:30,600 --> 02:12:31,399
Let's go.

1856
02:12:39,119 --> 02:12:40,399
I'd go back and talk to the lady.

1857
02:12:40,399 --> 02:12:41,520
Is she still in the same place?

1858
02:12:42,239 --> 02:12:43,279
Oh, she's you.

1859
02:12:48,439 --> 02:12:51,560
Well, that's a stab.

1860
02:12:52,279 --> 02:12:53,239
Don't embarrass me here.

1861
02:12:55,680 --> 02:12:56,640
Don't embarrass me here.

1862
02:12:57,930 --> 02:12:58,649
Standard enemy.

1863
02:12:58,649 --> 02:12:59,449
I knew that was coming.

1864
02:13:00,170 --> 02:13:01,210
You see me block that shit?

1865
02:13:01,210 --> 02:13:02,090
Didn't even know it was happening.

1866
02:13:04,720 --> 02:13:05,520
Okay, bye.

1867
02:13:05,520 --> 02:13:06,239
Goodbye.

1868
02:13:06,239 --> 02:13:07,279
I just want to talk to the lady.

1869
02:13:09,020 --> 02:13:31,159
Oh, I picked the worst fucking possible place to jump down.

1870
02:13:31,159 --> 02:13:33,840
Hey, I opened the door.

1871
02:13:35,520 --> 02:13:36,640
What item do I get?

1872
02:13:36,640 --> 02:13:37,199
Prayer bead.

1873
02:13:47,520 --> 02:13:48,079
I just did it.

1874
02:13:50,159 --> 02:13:50,880
Come on.

1875
02:13:50,880 --> 02:13:59,479
Well, now that I'm over here, let me just look around.

1876
02:13:59,479 --> 02:14:02,840
Because there's a bunch of shit that's underneath the water here.

1877
02:14:02,840 --> 02:14:09,789
I have to rest at an idol, didn't I?

1878
02:14:10,350 --> 02:14:13,479
I need to go.

1879
02:14:13,479 --> 02:14:16,039
All right, I have a lot of these scales.

1880
02:14:16,039 --> 02:14:17,319
I have at least eight.

1881
02:14:17,319 --> 02:14:19,520
I got to go back to the guy.

1882
02:14:19,520 --> 02:14:20,880
That weird guy in the bucket.

1883
02:14:21,600 --> 02:14:22,319
Remember that, dude?

1884
02:14:44,090 --> 02:14:48,329
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1885
02:14:49,130 --> 02:14:50,010
What this two?

1886
02:14:50,010 --> 02:14:51,770
Why is there one of these guys down here?

1887
02:14:52,329 --> 02:14:56,569
The fucking most hated enemy in the whole game is down here.

1888
02:15:00,329 --> 02:15:01,449
Just give me the item.

1889
02:15:04,779 --> 02:15:05,899
Why is he down here?

1890
02:15:06,460 --> 02:15:07,819
Are there two down here?

1891
02:15:08,460 --> 02:15:11,369
I just want everyone to be aware.

1892
02:15:11,369 --> 02:15:13,449
There's two headless in the water down here.

1893
02:15:23,260 --> 02:15:24,939
No, I'll never see the end of that content.

1894
02:15:28,829 --> 02:15:30,270
And I'm fine with that.

1895
02:15:30,270 --> 02:15:36,430
I will never get the 100% steam achievement.

1896
02:15:37,369 --> 02:15:37,770
That's fine.

1897
02:15:38,569 --> 02:15:41,069
I could give a shit lesson.

1898
02:15:43,359 --> 02:15:44,880
I can't believe these motherfuckers are down there.

1899
02:15:53,689 --> 02:15:54,090
Two?

1900
02:15:54,090 --> 02:15:54,970
There's two?

1901
02:15:54,970 --> 02:15:55,609
Headless?

1902
02:15:55,609 --> 02:15:55,850
Two?

1903
02:15:56,649 --> 02:15:58,760
Watch that be three.

1904
02:15:58,760 --> 02:16:03,640
Now it's down here?

1905
02:16:03,640 --> 02:16:04,359
Yep.

1906
02:16:04,359 --> 02:16:09,079
That's fucking crazy though.

1907
02:16:09,800 --> 02:16:17,310
They're really not messing around at all.

1908
02:16:17,310 --> 02:16:29,359
Okay, let's go back up.

1909
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:35,389
I don't think you can drown.

1910
02:16:44,409 --> 02:16:48,989
Anybody else?

1911
02:16:48,989 --> 02:16:49,870
I've these guys have.

1912
02:16:51,549 --> 02:16:54,270
Well, I think that's not these are the treasure ones.

1913
02:16:54,989 --> 02:16:56,909
All right, I got all that's down here.

1914
02:16:59,639 --> 02:17:00,440
Really?

1915
02:17:00,440 --> 02:17:01,760
That's fine.

1916
02:17:01,760 --> 02:17:02,000
Just.

1917
02:17:05,600 --> 02:17:19,690
Ah, I almost had it here.

1918
02:17:19,690 --> 02:17:21,129
These carps are everywhere.

1919
02:17:24,940 --> 02:17:26,860
I need to go in to see what I can buy.

1920
02:17:28,379 --> 02:17:30,040
What a bait.

1921
02:17:30,040 --> 02:17:38,079
I'm here.

1922
02:17:38,079 --> 02:17:39,120
This is so huge.

1923
02:17:39,120 --> 02:17:42,000
It's like almost feels like a waste if I don't go get everything.

1924
02:17:43,360 --> 02:17:49,100
I'll forget it this way.

1925
02:17:55,000 --> 02:17:56,120
All right, I think that's good.

1926
02:17:56,760 --> 02:17:58,670
Maybe one or two more things under these.

1927
02:18:07,520 --> 02:18:08,159
Scrap.

1928
02:18:08,159 --> 02:18:08,399
Good.

1929
02:18:09,520 --> 02:18:15,209
It's just bees.

1930
02:18:15,209 --> 02:18:16,090
They can't get you under water.

1931
02:18:26,250 --> 02:18:27,850
All right, I'm done fishing.

1932
02:18:27,850 --> 02:18:29,610
I got pretty much all the things I wanted.

1933
02:18:29,610 --> 02:18:39,120
Look at all that stuff.

1934
02:18:40,090 --> 02:18:41,690
Even if I died, how much money do I have?

1935
02:18:42,409 --> 02:18:45,920
There's so much.

1936
02:18:45,920 --> 02:18:47,200
Look at these four items here.

1937
02:18:54,120 --> 02:18:55,239
What the fuck is under here?

1938
02:18:58,620 --> 02:18:59,739
Oh, it's a fish.

1939
02:19:03,899 --> 02:19:06,620
Okay, one, two, three, go.

1940
02:19:13,719 --> 02:19:14,200
Worth it.

1941
02:19:23,280 --> 02:19:23,520
Okay.

1942
02:19:52,590 --> 02:19:52,909
Sweet.

1943
02:19:54,219 --> 02:19:55,260
So now I've rested.

1944
02:19:55,260 --> 02:19:56,700
Now I should talk to the lady.

1945
02:19:57,340 --> 02:19:58,459
Is this what we're doing?

1946
02:19:59,020 --> 02:20:04,969
That's technically a rest.

1947
02:20:05,690 --> 02:20:08,360
Try that.

1948
02:20:08,360 --> 02:20:08,760
Let's see.

1949
02:20:10,520 --> 02:20:10,840
Lady.

1950
02:20:11,639 --> 02:20:13,129
Hello.

1951
02:20:14,600 --> 02:20:15,159
Front door.

1952
02:20:15,159 --> 02:20:15,719
Did you make it?

1953
02:20:29,149 --> 02:20:30,270
She's still standing over there.

1954
02:20:43,469 --> 02:20:44,270
That's not her.

1955
02:20:44,270 --> 02:20:45,549
That's just a piece of metal.

1956
02:20:47,870 --> 02:20:49,659
Did I run by her?

1957
02:20:50,219 --> 02:20:55,770
Did I just have the blinders on and go right by that lady?

1958
02:20:55,770 --> 02:20:56,409
Really?

1959
02:20:56,409 --> 02:20:57,610
Well, the room is dark.

1960
02:20:57,610 --> 02:20:59,129
It's a pitch black room.

1961
02:20:59,129 --> 02:21:01,690
And you're telling me that, like, I can't believe you didn't see the lady

1962
02:21:01,690 --> 02:21:02,969
that's hunched over in the corner.

1963
02:21:03,530 --> 02:21:08,569
You didn't even look?

1964
02:21:08,569 --> 02:21:11,440
Yeah, because I thought she was just, I don't know.

1965
02:21:11,440 --> 02:21:22,399
Okay, guys, why would I know that that was the case here?

1966
02:21:23,040 --> 02:21:26,860
You don't even, like, look at, okay.

1967
02:21:27,659 --> 02:21:29,309
Look at this room.

1968
02:21:29,950 --> 02:21:32,110
Those guys are just eating people.

1969
02:21:32,110 --> 02:21:33,790
So I'm just going to fucking go this way.

1970
02:21:33,790 --> 02:21:34,829
Like, I, what?

1971
02:21:50,270 --> 02:21:51,069
No, you're blind.

1972
02:21:52,030 --> 02:21:52,430
Shut up.

1973
02:21:52,430 --> 02:21:52,829
Shut up.

1974
02:21:52,829 --> 02:21:53,149
Shut up.

1975
02:21:53,149 --> 02:21:53,549
Shut up.

1976
02:21:53,549 --> 02:21:53,870
Shut up.

1977
02:21:53,870 --> 02:21:54,270
Shut up.

1978
02:21:54,270 --> 02:21:54,590
Shut up.

1979
02:21:54,590 --> 02:22:09,879
Shut up.

1980
02:22:09,879 --> 02:22:13,530
Um, was that one even worth doing?

1981
02:22:14,409 --> 02:22:15,930
You didn't give me anything.

1982
02:22:15,930 --> 02:22:20,360
Not even, like, a little icon popping up.

1983
02:22:20,360 --> 02:22:21,000
Prayer beads.

1984
02:22:21,799 --> 02:22:29,370
Now, let's turn in the seed.

1985
02:22:34,809 --> 02:22:37,690
Oh, she was stabbing herself in the stomach.

1986
02:22:39,100 --> 02:22:43,520
I thought she was stabbing the body over and over again.

1987
02:22:46,719 --> 02:22:52,299
I thought she was, she was stabbing herself in the chest.

1988
02:22:52,299 --> 02:22:52,940
She wasn't.

1989
02:22:52,940 --> 02:22:53,979
She was stabbing the body.

1990
02:22:53,979 --> 02:22:55,100
Well, then, never mind.

1991
02:22:55,100 --> 02:22:55,819
Where's my item?

1992
02:22:56,700 --> 02:23:06,680
How do you know that?

1993
02:23:06,680 --> 02:23:07,159
You didn't see.

1994
02:23:17,440 --> 02:23:19,469
Um, I gotta go.

1995
02:23:19,469 --> 02:23:20,989
That lady goes from place to place.

1996
02:23:20,989 --> 02:23:22,430
She teleports as much as I do.

1997
02:23:23,149 --> 02:23:24,590
How much money do I have?

1998
02:23:24,590 --> 02:23:27,100
I got cash now.

1999
02:23:27,100 --> 02:23:28,379
Hmm, wait.

2000
02:23:34,840 --> 02:23:35,790
What can I do?

2001
02:23:35,790 --> 02:23:36,750
Oh, here.

2002
02:23:36,750 --> 02:23:37,709
Dragon Spring sake.

2003
02:23:37,709 --> 02:23:38,350
Give me a story.

2004
02:23:56,809 --> 02:23:58,969
I've given all sake to this guy.

2005
02:24:00,569 --> 02:24:04,170
With Dogen, Emma would keep our cups filled.

2006
02:24:04,170 --> 02:24:05,770
Have you known Lady Emma for long?

2007
02:24:09,340 --> 02:24:11,500
I found her on a battlefield.

2008
02:24:11,500 --> 02:24:12,829
A field?

2009
02:24:12,829 --> 02:24:15,309
She crept up slowly towards me.

2010
02:24:15,309 --> 02:24:19,950
Her eyes fixed, unwavering on the rice I held in my hand.

2011
02:24:19,950 --> 02:24:20,750
I got some of that, too.

2012
02:24:20,750 --> 02:24:21,309
You want some?

2013
02:24:22,190 --> 02:24:23,629
So I gave it to her.

2014
02:24:23,629 --> 02:24:26,510
Then she just started following me.

2015
02:24:26,510 --> 02:24:35,200
After that, Ashina became a dangerous place for the both of us.

2016
02:24:35,200 --> 02:24:38,639
Around then, Dogen adopted her as his daughter.

2017
02:24:40,600 --> 02:24:41,239
Wait, what?

2018
02:24:41,239 --> 02:24:44,200
I suppose it didn't really matter where she ended up.

2019
02:24:44,200 --> 02:24:44,680
Hold on.

2020
02:24:44,680 --> 02:24:46,120
One thing's for sure.

2021
02:24:46,120 --> 02:24:50,760
So he's happier for the fact she wasn't raised by a shinobi.

2022
02:24:51,879 --> 02:25:02,889
I've never seen this guy's face.

2023
02:25:03,930 --> 02:25:16,170
That's the person that raised Emma.

2024
02:25:16,170 --> 02:25:17,930
And Emma said she was raised by monkeys.

2025
02:25:25,709 --> 02:25:26,270
Yeah.

2026
02:25:26,270 --> 02:25:30,510
Let's go and talk to Emma about her really elaborate,

2027
02:25:30,510 --> 02:25:32,270
truth-stretching Facebook post.

2028
02:25:32,989 --> 02:25:44,040
Yeah, I was raised by wolves.

2029
02:25:44,040 --> 02:25:45,959
Were you?

2030
02:25:45,959 --> 02:26:03,280
No, you don't get that.

2031
02:26:03,280 --> 02:26:03,760
It's mine.

2032
02:26:03,760 --> 02:26:06,000
Master Wolf, it looked your brow.

2033
02:26:06,000 --> 02:26:07,440
Yeah, we've heard about my brow.

2034
02:26:07,440 --> 02:26:07,940
Goodbye.

2035
02:26:09,340 --> 02:26:09,899
We're just up here.

2036
02:26:09,899 --> 02:26:11,260
I might as well just get some more dialogue.

2037
02:26:11,260 --> 02:26:11,979
Anything?

2038
02:26:11,979 --> 02:26:16,010
I hope he's all right.

2039
02:26:16,010 --> 02:26:18,969
Oh, are you unhurt?

2040
02:26:18,969 --> 02:26:19,950
My lord.

2041
02:26:19,950 --> 02:26:21,639
Ah, this is for you.

2042
02:26:23,159 --> 02:26:24,360
Sweet Rice Balls.

2043
02:26:24,360 --> 02:26:25,959
A sweet sticky rice ball made by Kuro.

2044
02:26:26,520 --> 02:26:30,680
Slowly grants medium vitality recovery and constant posture recovery over a time.

2045
02:26:31,319 --> 02:26:35,959
Wolf senses it was crafted with feelings of resolve and a reluctance to part ways.

2046
02:26:36,600 --> 02:26:38,010
Okay.

2047
02:26:38,010 --> 02:26:40,520
So this is just a big...

2048
02:26:40,520 --> 02:26:41,399
I need to use.

2049
02:26:41,399 --> 02:26:42,520
I will obtain them.

2050
02:26:42,520 --> 02:26:43,639
Heal over time.

2051
02:26:43,639 --> 02:26:44,440
Yes.

2052
02:26:44,440 --> 02:26:45,719
I'm counting on you, Wolf.

2053
02:26:53,819 --> 02:26:54,540
So many items.

2054
02:26:58,110 --> 02:26:59,309
Number held one and a one.

2055
02:27:00,030 --> 02:27:01,469
I think this is just a one and done.

2056
02:27:02,110 --> 02:27:12,600
Well, thanks for the extra gourd.

2057
02:27:19,319 --> 02:27:19,959
I'm ready.

2058
02:27:21,479 --> 02:27:22,280
Palace grounds.

2059
02:27:25,200 --> 02:27:26,159
Eat it in front of him.

2060
02:27:26,159 --> 02:27:26,959
Eat it in front of him.

2061
02:27:27,520 --> 02:27:29,120
No, I need that for like a boss fight.

2062
02:27:30,000 --> 02:27:32,219
I'm not just gonna eat that in front of him.

2063
02:27:33,440 --> 02:27:34,239
He's not a boss.

2064
02:27:42,299 --> 02:27:43,260
I gotta go back and...

2065
02:27:44,639 --> 02:27:48,479
I gotta upgrade my stuff.

2066
02:27:48,479 --> 02:27:50,639
I think I have enough materials to do another one.

2067
02:27:51,440 --> 02:27:58,760
Oh, the fat guy that wanted the flower.

2068
02:27:58,760 --> 02:27:59,159
You're right.

2069
02:27:59,799 --> 02:28:00,600
I have that too.

2070
02:28:04,110 --> 02:28:04,590
You need...

2071
02:28:05,149 --> 02:28:07,959
All right.

2072
02:28:07,959 --> 02:28:09,479
Can I upgrade anything here?

2073
02:28:11,840 --> 02:28:14,159
I need more stuff.

2074
02:28:14,159 --> 02:28:14,959
I can't do it yet.

2075
02:28:15,680 --> 02:28:18,809
I need three more gunpowder which I could buy

2076
02:28:18,809 --> 02:28:20,649
and one more of that...

2077
02:28:20,649 --> 02:28:21,690
Is that iron scrap?

2078
02:28:21,690 --> 02:28:22,010
Let me see.

2079
02:28:22,010 --> 02:28:22,649
Does he sell that?

2080
02:28:35,440 --> 02:28:36,319
He does.

2081
02:28:36,319 --> 02:28:37,360
Okay, I can get that.

2082
02:28:38,079 --> 02:28:39,340
So I need...

2083
02:28:39,340 --> 02:28:39,819
How many do I need?

2084
02:28:39,819 --> 02:28:41,020
I need three of these, right?

2085
02:28:41,739 --> 02:28:46,219
Let me use my coin purse things.

2086
02:28:56,719 --> 02:28:57,760
So one more of these.

2087
02:28:58,399 --> 02:29:00,479
And then was it two of these that I needed?

2088
02:29:00,479 --> 02:29:01,200
It's two, right?

2089
02:29:01,760 --> 02:29:03,280
Two and then 600.

2090
02:29:03,280 --> 02:29:04,000
How much money do I have?

2091
02:29:11,319 --> 02:29:16,350
So now I need to take three of these.

2092
02:29:17,229 --> 02:29:25,659
Let's go upgrade this and then get close to the ultimate firecracker.

2093
02:29:26,700 --> 02:29:33,979
That's a thousand.

2094
02:29:33,979 --> 02:29:34,299
Shit!

2095
02:29:34,299 --> 02:29:35,100
It's a thousand?

2096
02:29:35,659 --> 02:29:36,459
That's so much.

2097
02:29:37,180 --> 02:29:51,069
Come here.

2098
02:29:54,139 --> 02:29:57,610
So what does this axe do though?

2099
02:29:57,610 --> 02:29:58,649
Is it worth putting on?

2100
02:29:58,649 --> 02:29:59,690
This is pretty deep in here.

2101
02:30:01,020 --> 02:30:01,979
Sparking axe.

2102
02:30:02,620 --> 02:30:05,600
Attach percussion hammer to create flame.

2103
02:30:08,159 --> 02:30:10,719
So bring a flaming axe down from above to strike an enemy.

2104
02:30:10,719 --> 02:30:13,440
Destroy shields made of wood and creates a roar of flames on hit.

2105
02:30:14,000 --> 02:30:17,129
Cool.

2106
02:30:17,129 --> 02:30:17,450
All right.

2107
02:30:18,170 --> 02:30:19,950
And then purple fume spark.

2108
02:30:20,590 --> 02:30:22,520
Here we go.

2109
02:30:24,780 --> 02:30:26,459
Final tier has been revealed.

2110
02:30:26,459 --> 02:30:27,260
It is...

2111
02:30:27,260 --> 02:30:28,459
Oh, it looks like...

2112
02:30:29,020 --> 02:30:31,799
Lazulite axe.

2113
02:30:32,440 --> 02:30:37,790
The hefty Lazulite blade inflicts damage even on guarding enemies.

2114
02:30:41,879 --> 02:30:43,000
It's like the super...

2115
02:30:43,959 --> 02:30:44,680
Minecraft.

2116
02:30:45,399 --> 02:30:47,500
What's the stuff from Minecraft?

2117
02:30:49,879 --> 02:30:50,840
Blue Lapis?

2118
02:30:50,840 --> 02:30:51,399
What's it called?

2119
02:30:51,879 --> 02:30:56,680
What about...

2120
02:30:56,680 --> 02:30:57,479
What's it...

2121
02:30:57,479 --> 02:30:58,120
Oh, the fuck.

2122
02:30:58,120 --> 02:30:59,000
Oh, man.

2123
02:30:59,799 --> 02:31:02,700
Oh, that's actually not that cool.

2124
02:31:02,700 --> 02:31:03,579
Never mind.

2125
02:31:03,579 --> 02:31:05,370
It's all Lazulite.

2126
02:31:05,370 --> 02:31:06,170
No Lazulite...

2127
02:31:07,370 --> 02:31:08,670
Sparks?

2128
02:31:09,309 --> 02:31:13,280
Phantom Kunai.

2129
02:31:13,280 --> 02:31:14,479
All right.

2130
02:31:14,479 --> 02:31:17,760
So now we need two of an item I have not seen yet.

2131
02:31:17,760 --> 02:31:18,719
It's like some kind of salt.

2132
02:31:20,319 --> 02:31:21,600
And then 1500 bucks.

2133
02:31:22,239 --> 02:31:34,200
I'm going to get rid of this and put on the better axe.

2134
02:31:35,770 --> 02:31:36,729
Sparking axe.

2135
02:31:37,450 --> 02:31:39,559
Better shurikens and long spark.

2136
02:31:40,510 --> 02:31:41,309
Combat arts.

2137
02:31:43,629 --> 02:31:46,989
I don't really use this that often, but it's useful sometimes.

2138
02:31:48,030 --> 02:31:49,389
This is the stealth one.

2139
02:31:51,850 --> 02:31:52,409
I'll keep it.

2140
02:31:53,049 --> 02:32:01,000
Can I help you with your essay?

2141
02:32:01,879 --> 02:32:02,920
Hey there, friend.

2142
02:32:03,719 --> 02:32:04,760
I don't think you'd want me to do that.

2143
02:32:06,809 --> 02:32:07,610
I'm going to buy...

2144
02:32:08,649 --> 02:32:11,879
I'm going to buy one of the...

2145
02:32:11,879 --> 02:32:12,120
Yeah.

2146
02:32:12,840 --> 02:32:14,270
I feel like I'm going to need these.

2147
02:32:18,030 --> 02:32:18,350
All right.

2148
02:32:18,350 --> 02:32:18,829
It's time.

2149
02:32:26,000 --> 02:32:27,120
The question is where...

2150
02:32:28,079 --> 02:32:29,520
Where is the barrel guy?

2151
02:32:32,459 --> 02:32:33,739
He's over here.

2152
02:32:34,459 --> 02:32:35,479
I don't remember.

2153
02:32:36,120 --> 02:32:42,909
It's either here or...

2154
02:32:43,549 --> 02:32:44,510
I think it's here.

2155
02:32:45,069 --> 02:32:49,020
Because this is...

2156
02:32:49,020 --> 02:32:50,459
He was very early in the game.

2157
02:32:54,379 --> 02:32:55,500
How early was he, though?

2158
02:32:56,379 --> 02:32:57,100
Oh, here it is.

2159
02:32:57,739 --> 02:32:58,829
This is it, right?

2160
02:33:01,659 --> 02:33:02,860
Please help with the essay.

2161
02:33:04,909 --> 02:33:05,950
No, I don't...

2162
02:33:05,950 --> 02:33:06,430
I can't.

2163
02:33:07,069 --> 02:33:10,219
Is this it?

2164
02:33:12,010 --> 02:33:15,149
Yeah.

2165
02:33:15,149 --> 02:33:15,709
Help him!

2166
02:33:16,590 --> 02:33:17,549
You don't want my help.

2167
02:33:17,549 --> 02:33:18,190
You'll get an F.

2168
02:33:18,829 --> 02:33:20,959
You know what?

2169
02:33:20,959 --> 02:33:21,760
No, I'll help.

2170
02:33:21,760 --> 02:33:22,000
Fine.

2171
02:33:22,000 --> 02:33:22,959
You want me to help you?

2172
02:33:22,959 --> 02:33:23,520
Listen.

2173
02:33:23,520 --> 02:33:23,920
Here you go.

2174
02:33:23,920 --> 02:33:24,719
Here's the advice.

2175
02:33:26,090 --> 02:33:27,690
Eat a good breakfast tomorrow.

2176
02:33:28,329 --> 02:33:33,690
I'm talking like two eggs, maybe one piece of bacon, some fruit, like a peach.

2177
02:33:35,020 --> 02:33:37,180
Sit on the couch for like 30 minutes, digest it,

2178
02:33:37,180 --> 02:33:39,340
make it get into your bloodstream, into your brain for brain power.

2179
02:33:40,700 --> 02:33:42,620
And then start.

2180
02:33:43,260 --> 02:33:45,559
That's my advice.

2181
02:33:47,530 --> 02:33:49,450
You need good brain power to do anything.

2182
02:33:51,079 --> 02:33:52,040
Like, for instance, today.

2183
02:33:52,760 --> 02:33:54,360
Good quality brain power food.

2184
02:33:54,360 --> 02:33:55,799
You've got to feed your brain.

2185
02:33:55,799 --> 02:33:57,879
And your brain is the most important organ.

2186
02:33:58,750 --> 02:34:01,469
It takes from any of the foods you eat.

2187
02:34:01,469 --> 02:34:02,989
How do you think you can, like, think?

2188
02:34:02,989 --> 02:34:04,909
Is you need good, high quality foods.

2189
02:34:05,629 --> 02:34:12,170
So I went to Burger King today and had a double whopper and two large fries.

2190
02:34:12,729 --> 02:34:15,040
I almost shit my pants before the stream.

2191
02:34:15,040 --> 02:34:29,600
I had so much time, I just fucked it up.

2192
02:34:29,600 --> 02:34:30,639
Oh, I need to look around.

2193
02:34:31,840 --> 02:34:35,280
Because there's got to be something under here.

2194
02:34:35,280 --> 02:34:36,719
Why would there not be something here?

2195
02:34:37,520 --> 02:34:38,719
The essay's due tonight.

2196
02:34:42,299 --> 02:34:43,979
Well, why did you wait so long?

2197
02:34:45,879 --> 02:34:48,040
You should have, you should have done it earlier.

2198
02:34:52,250 --> 02:34:55,520
All right.

2199
02:34:55,520 --> 02:34:56,159
Purchase items.

2200
02:34:56,159 --> 02:35:00,350
So I have 13 floating passage.

2201
02:35:00,350 --> 02:35:02,909
This is five, seven for the mask fragment.

2202
02:35:05,049 --> 02:35:06,090
Divine grass.

2203
02:35:06,090 --> 02:35:07,209
Does he have more than one of these?

2204
02:35:07,770 --> 02:35:09,049
I'll just buy 13 of these.

2205
02:35:09,690 --> 02:35:20,670
Skill unlocked upon requiring this item.

2206
02:35:20,670 --> 02:35:22,510
Unleash attacks in a flowing dance-like form,

2207
02:35:22,510 --> 02:35:24,590
overwhelming enemies in a furore of graceful aggression.

2208
02:35:25,229 --> 02:35:29,370
This technique belongs to the Ashina Sword School,

2209
02:35:29,370 --> 02:35:31,770
though it has been deemed heretical due to its foreign origin.

2210
02:35:33,659 --> 02:35:34,459
Red gourd.

2211
02:35:38,270 --> 02:35:41,229
Reduces burn buildup and slightly increases burn resistance.

2212
02:35:41,870 --> 02:35:46,000
It cannot heal the burn status abnormality, however.

2213
02:35:46,000 --> 02:35:46,500
Okay.

2214
02:35:47,200 --> 02:35:48,409
That sounds pretty good.

2215
02:35:48,409 --> 02:35:49,850
So this is just another drink.

2216
02:35:49,850 --> 02:35:51,290
How many, does he get five uses?

2217
02:35:52,170 --> 02:35:54,059
Oh, damn.

2218
02:35:54,780 --> 02:35:56,809
Give me that.

2219
02:35:58,729 --> 02:36:00,170
There's like three of these pieces.

2220
02:36:00,170 --> 02:36:01,690
I don't know if I'm going to be able to get all these.

2221
02:36:02,729 --> 02:36:04,170
I'm not sure if it's worth buying this.

2222
02:36:04,889 --> 02:36:10,909
How many pieces do I need?

2223
02:36:10,909 --> 02:36:12,270
Like two, three, four?

2224
02:36:15,370 --> 02:36:16,729
Mask fragment right.

2225
02:36:16,729 --> 02:36:17,770
I mean, I have the money.

2226
02:36:19,450 --> 02:36:20,489
There are three pieces.

2227
02:36:22,479 --> 02:36:23,360
It's really useful,

2228
02:36:23,360 --> 02:36:25,920
but I don't even know where to even start for that.

2229
02:36:25,920 --> 02:36:26,719
I know I saw the other one,

2230
02:36:26,719 --> 02:36:28,079
but there's apparently another one somewhere.

2231
02:36:28,799 --> 02:36:34,479
How many of these does he have?

2232
02:36:35,120 --> 02:36:38,120
He only had one.

2233
02:36:38,120 --> 02:36:38,360
Okay.

2234
02:36:38,360 --> 02:36:39,479
Well, that's worth it.

2235
02:36:39,479 --> 02:36:47,530
Well, I got the useful stuff.

2236
02:36:49,799 --> 02:36:51,079
I know where it is, right?

2237
02:36:52,799 --> 02:36:53,600
I know it's here.

2238
02:37:02,200 --> 02:37:12,219
You want to be the fish?

2239
02:37:12,219 --> 02:37:12,860
Holy shit.

2240
02:37:13,579 --> 02:37:14,860
Great Canadian fuck club.

2241
02:37:14,860 --> 02:37:16,059
20 community subs.

2242
02:37:19,389 --> 02:37:21,389
20 community subs from great Canadian.

2243
02:37:21,950 --> 02:37:22,670
Oh my God.

2244
02:37:24,829 --> 02:37:25,950
That's a shitload of subs.

2245
02:37:29,840 --> 02:37:31,520
That is a shitload of subs.

2246
02:37:36,540 --> 02:37:36,940
Thank you.

2247
02:37:37,579 --> 02:37:47,020
Damn.

2248
02:37:48,569 --> 02:37:49,690
What a great Canadian.

2249
02:37:50,329 --> 02:37:58,489
So you go, that's actually really good.

2250
02:38:01,479 --> 02:38:02,680
That comes up quick.

2251
02:38:06,489 --> 02:38:07,690
I like this better than the other one.

2252
02:38:07,690 --> 02:38:09,129
And then the other thing I have is slow.

2253
02:38:10,010 --> 02:38:15,500
You could like do a dodge or like dodge around and bang and then get out.

2254
02:38:16,139 --> 02:38:20,299
Maybe I'll try it.

2255
02:38:22,040 --> 02:38:22,840
Hey there.

2256
02:38:22,840 --> 02:38:23,799
Want me to just kill this guy?

2257
02:38:23,799 --> 02:38:26,350
No, I'm just kidding.

2258
02:38:26,350 --> 02:38:26,590
Cool.

2259
02:38:26,590 --> 02:38:28,030
So I have the gourd now.

2260
02:38:28,030 --> 02:38:28,430
Let's see.

2261
02:38:29,149 --> 02:38:34,879
Reduces burn buildup.

2262
02:38:37,850 --> 02:38:41,770
So I feel like I should have had this a long time ago.

2263
02:38:41,770 --> 02:38:44,409
There's been at least three or four bosses that were fire based.

2264
02:38:45,520 --> 02:38:47,600
I hope this is still worth using

2265
02:38:47,600 --> 02:38:49,040
because it took me a long time to get it.

2266
02:39:01,020 --> 02:39:02,459
717 subs.

2267
02:39:06,120 --> 02:39:06,360
Yeah.

2268
02:39:07,000 --> 02:39:13,690
You guys remember when we were talking like a few months ago

2269
02:39:13,690 --> 02:39:15,690
or two months ago, three months ago about crossing

2270
02:39:16,829 --> 02:39:19,709
like the thousands of subs that are on this channel?

2271
02:39:22,090 --> 02:39:22,329
Yeah.

2272
02:39:24,559 --> 02:39:28,479
Great Canadian has and had more than that I think earlier.

2273
02:39:35,979 --> 02:39:37,180
That's a shitload of money.

2274
02:39:37,819 --> 02:39:41,719
All right, let's go.

2275
02:39:41,719 --> 02:39:42,280
Time to fight.

2276
02:39:44,430 --> 02:39:45,950
No one actually is subscribing.

2277
02:39:45,950 --> 02:39:47,790
He's just giving everybody subs.

2278
02:39:50,350 --> 02:39:52,110
I never wouldn't see that surprising.

2279
02:39:52,829 --> 02:39:55,180
And here comes Kairatobi with 10.

2280
02:39:55,819 --> 02:39:59,659
217 from Kairatobi.

2281
02:39:59,659 --> 02:40:02,139
A lot of 17, 717, 217.

2282
02:40:02,860 --> 02:40:04,190
Interesting.

2283
02:40:04,190 --> 02:40:16,799
Got any tips for the Genichiro fight?

2284
02:40:17,440 --> 02:40:20,159
I'm about to lose my fucking mind with how hard it is.

2285
02:40:21,790 --> 02:40:24,700
Um, honestly with...

2286
02:40:24,700 --> 02:40:26,940
Okay, Splarg, five community subs.

2287
02:40:26,940 --> 02:40:27,659
Thanks a lot.

2288
02:40:27,659 --> 02:40:28,299
Thank you, Splarg.

2289
02:40:30,719 --> 02:40:33,600
I'll tell you with all the fights that are on the boss platform,

2290
02:40:35,719 --> 02:40:35,959
it's...

2291
02:40:37,879 --> 02:40:38,360
Everyone's...

2292
02:40:39,959 --> 02:40:42,120
I've read a lot of people talking about

2293
02:40:42,120 --> 02:40:44,360
be aggressive, aggressive, aggressive, going and go hard.

2294
02:40:45,639 --> 02:40:46,520
I'm not sure I agree.

2295
02:40:47,639 --> 02:40:49,079
At least for the fights that are up there.

2296
02:40:50,559 --> 02:40:54,079
I like to take a more parry, learn their moves

2297
02:40:54,079 --> 02:40:56,639
and just kind of block, block, block, parry, parry, parry, parry.

2298
02:40:57,879 --> 02:41:00,520
Sometimes when you go in, you can cross your brain up

2299
02:41:00,520 --> 02:41:03,399
with whether to swing or to block or to swing or to parry.

2300
02:41:04,280 --> 02:41:10,030
The deflect is so useful and it's so good

2301
02:41:11,610 --> 02:41:13,610
that it's, I think, at least on some of the fights

2302
02:41:13,610 --> 02:41:15,049
that when you fight a guy with a sword

2303
02:41:15,930 --> 02:41:19,450
to try and get the parry down for the moves.

2304
02:41:20,090 --> 02:41:21,610
And then there was another thing that...

2305
02:41:21,610 --> 02:41:23,129
Bebraham gave 10 community subs.

2306
02:41:25,450 --> 02:41:29,930
10 subs, 20 subs, 5 subs, 25, 5, 5, 10, 5, 5 from Freudian Weapon.

2307
02:41:34,299 --> 02:41:36,379
You guys trying to put me in another tax bracket?

2308
02:41:36,940 --> 02:41:38,090
Holy shit.

2309
02:41:41,500 --> 02:41:45,610
Here's the door.

2310
02:41:48,430 --> 02:41:50,590
Thank you for the tons of community subs, guys.

2311
02:41:51,229 --> 02:41:52,909
I have a feeling this is a boss.

2312
02:41:52,909 --> 02:41:53,870
Let's see what it is.

2313
02:41:53,870 --> 02:41:58,280
Maybe not.

2314
02:41:58,280 --> 02:42:05,709
Another zone.

2315
02:42:05,709 --> 02:42:06,670
I'm going to sneeze, I think.

2316
02:42:08,399 --> 02:42:12,620
Yeah, but ooh, item.

2317
02:42:12,620 --> 02:42:14,000
Just get it.

2318
02:42:14,639 --> 02:42:15,360
It is right here.

2319
02:42:16,000 --> 02:42:25,979
I need to use these.

2320
02:42:26,860 --> 02:42:29,899
I just never have the opportunity to go and do it.

2321
02:42:30,780 --> 02:42:32,909
Dude, if I could make a script.

2322
02:42:32,909 --> 02:42:37,049
Well, if I could have a script

2323
02:42:37,049 --> 02:42:39,610
that would automatically activate one of those.

2324
02:42:39,610 --> 02:42:41,610
Every like 30 minutes, I would have it work.

2325
02:42:42,329 --> 02:42:45,979
It's something like hanging on the tree.

2326
02:42:46,780 --> 02:42:52,559
What is it?

2327
02:42:56,520 --> 02:42:58,200
Oh, it's just a lizard.

2328
02:43:02,909 --> 02:43:03,870
Thank you, Jiber.

2329
02:43:04,829 --> 02:43:05,549
Jiber is 7.

2330
02:43:06,969 --> 02:43:08,010
5 more community subs.

2331
02:43:10,440 --> 02:43:12,520
Sub train, after sub train, after sub train.

2332
02:43:12,520 --> 02:43:13,399
Sub, sub, subs.

2333
02:43:14,040 --> 02:43:18,090
I like this little spot, though.

2334
02:43:18,729 --> 02:43:21,899
He was just chilling.

2335
02:43:21,899 --> 02:43:23,979
Yeah, but look, his anger meter is there.

2336
02:43:32,000 --> 02:43:32,879
Maybe?

2337
02:43:32,879 --> 02:43:35,069
Because back up here is the...

2338
02:43:35,790 --> 02:43:41,500
No, I guess we're going this way.

2339
02:43:41,500 --> 02:43:43,659
Dear Meaty, 5 community subs.

2340
02:43:46,459 --> 02:43:47,420
Thank you, guys.

2341
02:43:47,420 --> 02:43:47,979
5 more.

2342
02:43:52,760 --> 02:43:53,879
Looks like I can get up there.

2343
02:44:03,020 --> 02:44:05,100
So many subscriptions.

2344
02:44:05,739 --> 02:44:15,120
Come on, I can't reach the...

2345
02:44:15,120 --> 02:44:16,319
Jump from tree to tree, maybe?

2346
02:44:17,690 --> 02:44:18,969
The Zinger Slinger.

2347
02:44:18,969 --> 02:44:20,090
5 community subs.

2348
02:44:21,840 --> 02:44:23,760
Subs, subs, even more of them.

2349
02:44:24,969 --> 02:44:26,489
They just don't stop coming.

2350
02:44:27,129 --> 02:44:28,829
They are just here.

2351
02:44:29,709 --> 02:44:30,209
Forever.

2352
02:44:31,290 --> 02:44:32,329
Sub train.

2353
02:44:32,329 --> 02:44:32,829
Forever.

2354
02:44:34,110 --> 02:44:35,069
Thank you, Zinger Slinger.

2355
02:44:37,520 --> 02:44:38,020
All right.

2356
02:44:38,639 --> 02:44:41,530
Is that an enemy or is it just somebody angry

2357
02:44:41,530 --> 02:44:42,250
that I'm coming up here?

2358
02:44:42,809 --> 02:44:50,729
No, somebody's just powering up.

2359
02:44:50,809 --> 02:44:51,930
Spliceable Spleen.

2360
02:44:51,930 --> 02:44:53,049
5 community subs.

2361
02:44:54,010 --> 02:44:54,510
Thank you.

2362
02:44:58,040 --> 02:44:58,540
Subs.

2363
02:44:59,610 --> 02:45:00,409
Holy shit.

2364
02:45:00,409 --> 02:45:00,909
All right.

2365
02:45:03,069 --> 02:45:04,350
That's too many.

2366
02:45:04,350 --> 02:45:07,069
Too, too many lightning bolts.

2367
02:45:08,809 --> 02:45:09,610
You didn't even do it.

2368
02:45:13,629 --> 02:45:14,129
God.

2369
02:45:15,500 --> 02:45:16,299
No, stop!

2370
02:45:16,299 --> 02:45:16,799
Just...

2371
02:45:20,000 --> 02:45:20,959
I gotta pull you down here.

2372
02:45:32,600 --> 02:45:33,100
Get it!

2373
02:45:33,799 --> 02:45:34,840
Oh my God!

2374
02:45:34,840 --> 02:45:35,340
Die!

2375
02:45:37,920 --> 02:45:41,850
Honest to God.

2376
02:45:41,850 --> 02:45:43,129
I can't believe that guy's still alive.

2377
02:45:43,930 --> 02:45:44,649
I'm shocked.

2378
02:45:51,629 --> 02:45:52,270
Damn it!

2379
02:45:52,270 --> 02:45:52,770
No!

2380
02:46:02,879 --> 02:46:03,440
Damn it.

2381
02:46:03,440 --> 02:46:04,159
Oh my goodness.

2382
02:46:04,159 --> 02:46:05,440
These guys are so irritating.

2383
02:46:06,559 --> 02:46:07,520
Uh, Krusty!

2384
02:46:07,520 --> 02:46:09,120
Thank you, Krusty, for 5 community subs.

2385
02:46:10,159 --> 02:46:13,290
All right, look at the health.

2386
02:46:13,290 --> 02:46:14,010
Like, give me a break.

2387
02:46:16,200 --> 02:46:17,639
What are you doing?

2388
02:46:17,639 --> 02:46:22,170
I feel like I'm not doing

2389
02:46:22,170 --> 02:46:23,850
even remotely enough damage right now.

2390
02:46:23,850 --> 02:46:24,250
How?

2391
02:46:24,250 --> 02:46:25,930
I just upgraded my sword.

2392
02:46:25,930 --> 02:46:26,430
What?

2393
02:46:27,840 --> 02:46:28,799
That feels so wrong.

2394
02:46:37,870 --> 02:46:38,590
I, I even...

2395
02:46:44,040 --> 02:46:44,920
Just kidding.

2396
02:46:44,920 --> 02:46:47,000
Fucking God, come on!

2397
02:46:48,040 --> 02:46:48,540
Why?

2398
02:46:51,209 --> 02:46:52,649
I'm not using the other resurrect.

2399
02:46:55,819 --> 02:46:56,319
Huh?

2400
02:47:06,700 --> 02:47:08,040
I probably didn't do, like...

2401
02:47:08,700 --> 02:47:09,899
80% of my health.

2402
02:47:10,459 --> 02:47:15,450
All right, let's go.

2403
02:47:29,549 --> 02:47:31,069
Just hard to deal with more than one enemy.

2404
02:47:31,709 --> 02:47:33,840
When you fight more than one person, you just...

2405
02:47:34,969 --> 02:47:36,010
Just fucking...

2406
02:47:36,010 --> 02:47:36,510
Chaos.

2407
02:47:37,209 --> 02:47:41,680
Can I go around this way and kill one of them?

2408
02:47:42,239 --> 02:47:44,319
Deal with two of them.

2409
02:47:44,319 --> 02:47:45,520
Oh, three of them at the same time.

2410
02:47:45,520 --> 02:47:47,120
It's just, that's not gonna happen.

2411
02:47:50,079 --> 02:47:50,719
I guess not.

2412
02:47:50,719 --> 02:47:51,760
You just have to do it.

2413
02:47:52,559 --> 02:48:02,860
Well, I got none of these.

2414
02:48:26,219 --> 02:48:26,719
Fuck.

2415
02:48:26,719 --> 02:48:32,420
As long as we're far enough away.

2416
02:48:32,420 --> 02:48:58,770
Damn it!

2417
02:48:58,770 --> 02:49:00,770
This is such a massive delay.

2418
02:49:00,770 --> 02:49:06,950
WHAAAAAAAT?

2419
02:50:23,799 --> 02:50:25,799
Wait, hold on. Let me read the message here.

2420
02:50:25,799 --> 02:50:28,899
Try backstab.

2421
02:50:28,899 --> 02:50:29,899
Hull.

2422
02:50:30,899 --> 02:50:32,200
Right? Right, guys?

2423
02:50:32,200 --> 02:50:35,270
Oh, they're dead. Nevermind.

2424
02:50:35,270 --> 02:50:38,370
Sorry, nevermind.

2425
02:50:38,370 --> 02:50:39,610
Should I pray?

2426
02:50:39,610 --> 02:50:51,280
Right?

2427
02:50:51,280 --> 02:50:52,280
This is Dark Souls game.

2428
02:50:52,280 --> 02:50:54,280
You have to write the funny line everywhere.

2429
02:50:54,280 --> 02:50:55,280
Behind every enemy.

2430
02:50:55,280 --> 02:50:56,280
Behind every person.

2431
02:50:56,280 --> 02:51:04,979
Is there an enemy that's facing over a balcony?

2432
02:51:04,979 --> 02:51:06,979
There's just a standard enemy.

2433
02:51:06,979 --> 02:51:08,219
It better be there.

2434
02:51:08,219 --> 02:51:27,120
This is coming from the man who talks about diapers and puke every stream.

2435
02:51:28,870 --> 02:51:29,870
Hold on.

2436
02:51:29,870 --> 02:51:30,870
Just wait.

2437
02:51:30,870 --> 02:51:32,870
I gotta defend myself on that one.

2438
02:51:32,870 --> 02:51:39,500
I'm not writing it down and putting it in front of every enemy.

2439
02:51:39,500 --> 02:51:42,809
I don't go behind every enemy in the game and say,

2440
02:51:42,809 --> 02:51:43,809
Look at his diaper!

2441
02:51:43,809 --> 02:51:46,260
That...

2442
02:51:46,260 --> 02:51:47,260
Every enemy?

2443
02:51:47,260 --> 02:51:48,260
Every NPC?

2444
02:51:48,260 --> 02:51:52,059
I don't do that.

2445
02:51:52,059 --> 02:51:54,559
Alright, what the hell is this?

2446
02:51:54,559 --> 02:51:55,559
This is like...

2447
02:51:55,559 --> 02:52:02,000
This is clearly a boss.

2448
02:52:02,000 --> 02:52:10,000
Old Dragons of the...

2449
02:52:10,000 --> 02:52:14,200
Oh god, they're just gonna cough on me?

2450
02:52:14,200 --> 02:52:17,459
No, no, it's like being at PAX!

2451
02:52:17,459 --> 02:52:18,459
I don't want to be...

2452
02:52:18,459 --> 02:52:20,459
It's like going on an airplane!

2453
02:52:28,020 --> 02:52:32,799
Well, okay.

2454
02:52:32,799 --> 02:52:34,799
They're just like puking.

2455
02:52:34,799 --> 02:52:37,799
Alright, let's go ahead and put on the antidote.

2456
02:52:43,649 --> 02:52:55,250
Yeah, From Software has such a massive, massive, massive hard-on

2457
02:52:55,250 --> 02:52:59,250
for fight like a hundred of the same enemy in a boss fight.

2458
02:52:59,250 --> 02:53:00,250
Really.

2459
02:53:00,250 --> 02:53:03,959
Bloodborne, it was the spider boss.

2460
02:53:03,959 --> 02:53:06,959
Deacons, like why do they have to do this?

2461
02:53:06,959 --> 02:53:17,989
I wonder if there's something like...

2462
02:53:17,989 --> 02:53:18,989
Let's see, hold on.

2463
02:53:18,989 --> 02:53:21,379
I mean that's kind of...

2464
02:53:21,379 --> 02:53:22,379
That actually is pretty effective.

2465
02:53:22,379 --> 02:53:23,379
Then I'm gonna get poisoned.

2466
02:53:23,379 --> 02:53:25,559
What else do I have here?

2467
02:53:25,559 --> 02:53:28,629
What the fuck?

2468
02:53:28,629 --> 02:53:30,629
Oh no.

2469
02:53:30,629 --> 02:53:34,940
Do I fight it?

2470
02:53:34,940 --> 02:53:36,940
Do I fight the tree?

2471
02:53:36,940 --> 02:53:37,940
I don't know.

2472
02:53:37,940 --> 02:53:44,729
Ooh, that's actually pretty good.

2473
02:53:44,729 --> 02:53:51,729
I'm poisoned.

2474
02:53:51,729 --> 02:54:04,870
No, it's not worth it.

2475
02:54:04,870 --> 02:54:06,870
It takes too long.

2476
02:54:06,870 --> 02:54:17,239
Can I like hurt the tree?

2477
02:54:17,239 --> 02:54:19,250
No.

2478
02:54:19,250 --> 02:54:25,260
Let's go back bread and butter.

2479
02:54:25,260 --> 02:54:47,299
Use axe on tree like in Minecraft.

2480
02:54:47,299 --> 02:55:01,569
Wait, what's this?

2481
02:55:01,569 --> 02:55:03,129
That was a different one.

2482
02:55:03,129 --> 02:55:12,469
That one's different.

2483
02:55:12,469 --> 02:55:15,479
Is this just the deacons?

2484
02:55:15,479 --> 02:55:42,489
What was that?

2485
02:55:42,489 --> 02:56:01,200
All right, I can re-come out this time.

2486
02:56:01,200 --> 02:56:03,200
This can't be it, right?

2487
02:56:03,200 --> 02:56:18,940
I mean that's satisfying to do, but...

2488
02:56:18,940 --> 02:56:31,360
All right, that's it.

2489
02:56:31,360 --> 02:56:32,360
Is that it?

2490
02:56:32,360 --> 02:56:36,069
No, of course that's not it.

2491
02:56:36,069 --> 02:56:42,879
Oh, I can't wait to fight the real boss

2492
02:56:42,879 --> 02:56:44,879
and then have to do that, what I just did again

2493
02:56:44,879 --> 02:56:45,879
because I'm gonna get killed by the guy

2494
02:56:45,879 --> 02:56:47,879
that swings like 300 times a second

2495
02:56:47,879 --> 02:56:50,879
because he's like one of the later game bosses.

2496
02:56:50,879 --> 02:56:52,889
They're gonna all transform

2497
02:56:52,889 --> 02:56:54,889
into a fucking monster or something.

2498
02:56:54,889 --> 02:57:08,819
Let's see if I can get this done.

2499
02:57:08,819 --> 02:57:12,020
I have to take a break after this.

2500
02:57:12,020 --> 02:57:13,020
I'm gonna lose.

2501
02:57:13,020 --> 02:57:15,020
I gotta grab a little drink.

2502
02:57:15,020 --> 02:57:23,079
Man, that's so cool.

2503
02:57:23,079 --> 02:57:25,260
Wow.

2504
02:57:25,260 --> 02:57:31,569
Oh, divine dragon.

2505
02:57:31,569 --> 02:57:41,459
Okay, so that's a sweep.

2506
02:57:41,459 --> 02:57:43,459
That's just a big sweep.

2507
02:57:43,459 --> 02:57:45,600
What else do you do?

2508
02:57:45,600 --> 02:57:47,600
I guess I can go like this.

2509
02:57:48,600 --> 02:57:50,899
Ow, that hurt.

2510
02:57:50,899 --> 02:58:01,909
Okay, he strikes you with lightning

2511
02:58:01,909 --> 02:58:02,909
and then you strike...

2512
02:58:02,909 --> 02:58:04,909
Oh, God, where's he going?

2513
02:58:04,909 --> 02:58:07,909
Oh, my God, what the fuck is he doing?

2514
02:58:07,909 --> 02:58:10,690
Wow.

2515
02:58:10,690 --> 02:58:16,379
Wow, this is really cool.

2516
02:58:16,379 --> 02:58:22,100
I love this fight.

2517
02:58:22,100 --> 02:58:25,100
Holy shit, that hurt.

2518
02:58:25,100 --> 02:58:30,670
I'm gonna die.

2519
02:58:30,670 --> 02:58:40,340
Bang.

2520
02:58:40,340 --> 02:58:41,340
Oh, fuck.

2521
02:58:41,340 --> 02:58:47,700
I gotta wait longer than that.

2522
02:58:47,700 --> 02:58:51,950
Damn.

2523
02:58:51,950 --> 02:58:54,950
Maybe I should just jump around to the trees.

2524
02:58:54,950 --> 02:59:06,340
I can't.

2525
02:59:06,340 --> 02:59:07,899
You wait.

2526
02:59:07,899 --> 02:59:09,899
I can parry the sword.

2527
02:59:09,899 --> 02:59:11,899
I'm so far away.

2528
02:59:11,899 --> 02:59:19,709
That seems like I shouldn't be able to do that.

2529
02:59:19,709 --> 02:59:37,299
It's kind of delayed.

2530
02:59:37,299 --> 02:59:40,579
Do again?

2531
02:59:40,579 --> 02:59:43,870
Lightning?

2532
02:59:43,870 --> 02:59:44,870
Nope.

2533
02:59:44,870 --> 02:59:45,870
Grab it, grab it.

2534
02:59:45,870 --> 02:59:56,579
Aw.

2535
02:59:56,579 --> 03:00:00,059
All right.

2536
03:00:00,059 --> 03:00:01,059
Fuck.

2537
03:00:01,059 --> 03:00:08,770
I'm dead.

2538
03:00:08,770 --> 03:00:17,659
When does he do the electricity?

2539
03:00:17,659 --> 03:00:18,659
All right.

2540
03:00:18,659 --> 03:00:22,079
Well, hold on.

2541
03:00:22,079 --> 03:00:23,079
Okay.

2542
03:00:23,079 --> 03:00:24,079
Oh, right.

2543
03:00:24,079 --> 03:00:28,079
Okay, so let's just do that again.

2544
03:00:32,329 --> 03:00:36,329
All right, well, that makes it a little easier knowing that.

2545
03:00:36,329 --> 03:00:37,329
Okay.

2546
03:00:37,329 --> 03:00:42,280
Oh, God.

2547
03:00:42,280 --> 03:00:43,280
Don't die here.

2548
03:00:43,280 --> 03:00:50,000
Give me some more trees.

2549
03:00:50,000 --> 03:01:04,170
Tree, give me a tree.

2550
03:01:04,170 --> 03:01:05,170
Holy shit.

2551
03:01:05,170 --> 03:01:06,170
What the fuck?

2552
03:01:06,170 --> 03:01:08,049
What the fuck?

2553
03:01:08,049 --> 03:01:12,819
Where's the trees?

2554
03:01:12,819 --> 03:01:21,020
Oh, my God.

2555
03:01:21,020 --> 03:01:22,020
So all right.

2556
03:01:22,020 --> 03:01:24,020
That fight is a total joke.

2557
03:01:24,020 --> 03:01:28,020
And then he randomly just goes crazy for like 10 straight seconds.

2558
03:01:28,020 --> 03:01:30,469
Okay.

2559
03:01:30,469 --> 03:01:32,469
Well, now we're going to do the deacons again.

2560
03:01:32,469 --> 03:01:42,260
It's just a cinematic boss.

2561
03:01:42,260 --> 03:01:44,260
Died to the cinematic boss.

2562
03:01:44,260 --> 03:01:46,260
Whoa, who gives a shit?

2563
03:01:46,260 --> 03:01:48,260
It's the first time I've even seen it.

2564
03:01:48,260 --> 03:01:50,819
I can't believe you didn't beat that.

2565
03:01:50,819 --> 03:01:53,819
I mean, like, this is the first time you've ever seen this.

2566
03:01:53,819 --> 03:01:54,819
How did you not know that?

2567
03:01:54,819 --> 03:01:55,819
I can't...

2568
03:01:55,819 --> 03:01:58,819
No, you should have known that you need to jump on the tree.

2569
03:01:58,819 --> 03:02:02,129
Were you, like, looking at the boss and how cool the boss was?

2570
03:02:02,129 --> 03:02:06,129
You didn't beat it the first fucking try like you did the last three bosses?

2571
03:02:06,129 --> 03:02:07,129
I'm something.

2572
03:02:07,129 --> 03:02:23,790
No, do it.

2573
03:02:23,790 --> 03:02:24,790
Why did I fall?

2574
03:02:24,790 --> 03:02:35,530
Oh, it disappeared.

2575
03:02:35,530 --> 03:02:53,659
Hi.

2576
03:02:53,659 --> 03:02:59,129
All right.

2577
03:02:59,129 --> 03:03:00,129
Let's do this again.

2578
03:03:00,129 --> 03:03:07,090
That's really not even that bad of a deal.

2579
03:03:07,090 --> 03:03:08,090
Hi, King.

2580
03:03:08,090 --> 03:03:09,090
Thanks for the 10 community subs.

2581
03:03:09,090 --> 03:03:11,799
All right.

2582
03:03:11,799 --> 03:03:13,620
Here we go.

2583
03:03:13,620 --> 03:03:14,620
Lightning trees.

2584
03:03:14,620 --> 03:03:15,620
And then he goes crazy.

2585
03:03:15,620 --> 03:03:16,620
This is so cool.

2586
03:03:16,620 --> 03:03:17,620
It really is like an awesome fight.

2587
03:03:17,620 --> 03:03:24,549
That still hit me.

2588
03:03:24,549 --> 03:03:25,549
All right.

2589
03:03:25,549 --> 03:03:29,860
Which one's lit up?

2590
03:03:29,860 --> 03:03:31,860
None of them so far?

2591
03:03:31,860 --> 03:03:45,649
Fly around.

2592
03:03:45,649 --> 03:03:48,809
Which one?

2593
03:03:48,809 --> 03:03:54,700
He's going to knock me back?

2594
03:03:54,700 --> 03:04:02,979
Hello.

2595
03:04:02,979 --> 03:04:04,659
Hello.

2596
03:04:04,659 --> 03:04:06,540
I see it.

2597
03:04:07,540 --> 03:04:25,899
What the fuck are you doing, game?

2598
03:04:25,899 --> 03:04:26,899
Oh, shit.

2599
03:04:26,899 --> 03:04:27,899
He was ducking.

2600
03:04:27,899 --> 03:04:38,010
I thought I was just going to go right into his body.

2601
03:04:38,010 --> 03:04:43,219
All right.

2602
03:04:43,219 --> 03:04:44,219
Here we go.

2603
03:04:44,219 --> 03:04:46,799
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2604
03:04:46,799 --> 03:04:47,799
Just lock on.

2605
03:04:47,799 --> 03:04:48,799
I don't matter.

2606
03:04:48,799 --> 03:04:57,850
He can go under.

2607
03:04:57,850 --> 03:04:58,850
All right.

2608
03:04:58,850 --> 03:05:10,389
Go.

2609
03:05:10,389 --> 03:05:19,680
Any more?

2610
03:05:19,680 --> 03:05:20,680
Over there.

2611
03:05:20,680 --> 03:05:21,680
Here we go.

2612
03:05:21,680 --> 03:05:22,680
Time for him to do a bunch of stupid moves.

2613
03:05:22,680 --> 03:05:27,500
Let's do it.

2614
03:05:27,500 --> 03:05:28,500
Come on.

2615
03:05:28,500 --> 03:05:51,809
What do you got?

2616
03:05:51,809 --> 03:05:52,809
Oh, I was trying to.

2617
03:05:52,809 --> 03:05:54,430
I was trying to parry.

2618
03:05:54,430 --> 03:05:55,430
Fuck, man.

2619
03:05:55,430 --> 03:05:56,670
He's not.

2620
03:05:56,670 --> 03:05:57,670
All right.

2621
03:05:57,670 --> 03:06:01,659
Here are the trees.

2622
03:06:01,659 --> 03:06:02,659
I win.

2623
03:06:02,659 --> 03:06:03,659
What?

2624
03:06:03,659 --> 03:06:09,770
Whoa.

2625
03:06:09,770 --> 03:06:11,329
You're alive?

2626
03:06:11,329 --> 03:06:12,329
What's that?

2627
03:06:12,329 --> 03:06:15,229
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

2628
03:06:15,229 --> 03:06:17,819
Get it.

2629
03:06:17,819 --> 03:06:18,819
Get it.

2630
03:06:18,819 --> 03:06:19,819
Get it.

2631
03:06:19,819 --> 03:06:20,819
Grab it.

2632
03:06:20,819 --> 03:06:21,819
Grab it.

2633
03:06:21,819 --> 03:06:25,360
Do it.

2634
03:06:25,360 --> 03:06:26,360
Grab it.

2635
03:06:26,360 --> 03:06:36,750
Grab it.

2636
03:06:36,750 --> 03:06:37,750
Oh, shit.

2637
03:06:37,750 --> 03:06:38,750
Okay.

2638
03:06:38,750 --> 03:06:46,780
That was really cool.

2639
03:06:46,780 --> 03:06:52,940
Gracious gift of tears.

2640
03:06:52,940 --> 03:06:53,940
I kind of feel bad.

2641
03:06:53,940 --> 03:06:54,940
Well, that was definitely the coolest boss fight.

2642
03:06:54,940 --> 03:06:59,319
Divine dragon.

2643
03:06:59,319 --> 03:07:03,840
Commiem with the sculptor's idol and confront memories of a battle to permanently increase

2644
03:07:03,840 --> 03:07:04,840
attack power.

2645
03:07:04,840 --> 03:07:13,180
Tutorial boss.

2646
03:07:13,180 --> 03:07:14,180
Give it a rest.

2647
03:07:14,940 --> 03:07:24,780
Give it a rest.

2648
03:07:24,780 --> 03:07:28,590
Like, give it a rest.

2649
03:07:28,590 --> 03:07:29,590
Like this guy.

2650
03:07:29,590 --> 03:07:34,659
Lord Isshin, what happened?

2651
03:07:34,659 --> 03:07:35,659
That's impossible.

2652
03:07:35,659 --> 03:07:36,659
I've been curing it.

2653
03:07:36,659 --> 03:07:38,030
I see.

2654
03:07:38,030 --> 03:07:45,750
I'm sure you, the central forces, have taken this opportunity.

2655
03:07:45,750 --> 03:07:52,700
The key to the secret passage that leads out of Isshin Castle.

2656
03:07:52,700 --> 03:07:56,940
The secret passage can be found at the end of the moat in the Isshin Reservoir,

2657
03:07:56,940 --> 03:08:02,030
not far from the Moonview Tower.

2658
03:08:02,229 --> 03:08:05,229
So this is the same place we were at the beginning of the game?

2659
03:08:05,229 --> 03:08:08,469
Yes, Master Wolf.

2660
03:08:08,469 --> 03:08:13,469
The secret passage can be found along the moat in the Ashina Reservoir,

2661
03:08:13,469 --> 03:08:16,479
not far from the Moon.

2662
03:08:16,479 --> 03:08:20,479
Lord Kuro escaped the castle through that secret passage

2663
03:08:20,479 --> 03:08:24,479
and should be waiting for you in the Silvergrass Field.

2664
03:08:24,479 --> 03:08:25,479
Understood.

2665
03:08:25,479 --> 03:08:30,809
The Nightjar have left smoke signals under Lord Isshin's orders.

2666
03:08:30,809 --> 03:08:32,979
The smoke should lead the way to order.

2667
03:08:33,180 --> 03:08:38,610
Okay, so I have the key.

2668
03:08:38,610 --> 03:08:41,770
Cool.

2669
03:08:41,770 --> 03:08:42,770
Tutorial complete.

2670
03:08:42,770 --> 03:08:43,770
Now the new...

2671
03:08:43,770 --> 03:08:44,770
All right.

2672
03:08:44,770 --> 03:08:49,350
Anyone that says the word tutorial and boss in the same sentence?

2673
03:08:49,350 --> 03:08:52,350
I mean, you can write that, but if there's an LOL there,

2674
03:08:52,350 --> 03:08:55,299
or like a Kappa or something,

2675
03:08:55,299 --> 03:08:57,299
I want them permanently removed from my chat room.

2676
03:08:57,299 --> 03:09:02,729
If I see tutorial boss and only if there's an LOL in there too,

2677
03:09:02,729 --> 03:09:04,729
because you could just write,

2678
03:09:04,729 --> 03:09:07,969
hey, I died on the tutorial boss.

2679
03:09:07,969 --> 03:09:08,969
Right?

2680
03:09:08,969 --> 03:09:11,590
Or, the tutorial was really fun.

2681
03:09:11,790 --> 03:09:14,790
I really enjoyed fighting against the guy that couldn't die,

2682
03:09:14,790 --> 03:09:16,790
but the first boss was tough, right?

2683
03:09:16,790 --> 03:09:18,350
That's okay.

2684
03:09:18,350 --> 03:09:21,350
But tutorial boss LUL, or tutorial boss,

2685
03:09:21,350 --> 03:09:22,350
like, fuck you.

2686
03:09:22,350 --> 03:09:23,530
You're gone.

2687
03:09:23,530 --> 03:09:28,290
Forever.

2688
03:09:28,290 --> 03:09:29,290
All right, I gotta pee.

2689
03:09:29,290 --> 03:09:32,000
I'm very fat.

2690
03:09:32,000 --> 03:09:33,000
I gotta pee.

2691
03:11:23,360 --> 03:11:26,329
Look here, my logs.

2692
03:11:29,659 --> 03:11:30,659
Okay.

2693
03:11:30,659 --> 03:11:32,020
So there are...

2694
03:11:32,020 --> 03:11:35,020
There's over 2,700 people here.

2695
03:11:35,020 --> 03:11:38,020
Just checking up and doing a search keyword,

2696
03:11:38,219 --> 03:11:41,659
Control F for tutorial boss LUL.

2697
03:11:41,659 --> 03:11:42,659
Okay.

2698
03:11:42,659 --> 03:11:48,290
So 1,700 people are gone when I press Enter.

2699
03:11:52,920 --> 03:12:01,979
So I'm willing to accept an apology before I press this.

2700
03:12:01,979 --> 03:12:03,979
I'm sitting right here.

2701
03:12:03,979 --> 03:12:08,229
Sorry.

2702
03:12:08,229 --> 03:12:09,229
Somebody said not sorry.

2703
03:12:09,229 --> 03:12:15,909
Okay.

2704
03:12:15,909 --> 03:12:16,909
No LOL.

2705
03:12:16,909 --> 03:12:17,909
You suck.

2706
03:12:17,909 --> 03:12:18,909
Tutorial boss.

2707
03:12:18,909 --> 03:12:20,409
Coward.

2708
03:12:20,409 --> 03:12:21,649
Do it.

2709
03:12:21,649 --> 03:12:22,649
Not sorry.

2710
03:12:22,649 --> 03:12:26,319
Coward.

2711
03:12:26,319 --> 03:12:27,319
No balls.

2712
03:12:27,319 --> 03:12:28,319
Snap him.

2713
03:12:28,319 --> 03:12:31,420
You suck.

2714
03:12:31,620 --> 03:12:32,620
You suck.

2715
03:12:32,620 --> 03:12:37,540
You're fat in real life.

2716
03:12:37,540 --> 03:12:38,540
Snap now.

2717
03:12:38,540 --> 03:12:41,319
Ban.

2718
03:12:41,319 --> 03:12:42,319
Sorry, dude.

2719
03:12:42,319 --> 03:12:43,319
Okay, there it is.

2720
03:12:43,319 --> 03:12:44,940
Sorry, dude.

2721
03:12:44,940 --> 03:12:46,120
Yep.

2722
03:12:46,120 --> 03:12:47,120
No, I accept it.

2723
03:12:47,120 --> 03:12:48,120
I accept the apology.

2724
03:12:50,959 --> 03:12:51,959
Thanks, guys.

2725
03:12:51,959 --> 03:12:54,959
I like when you guys understand how you're being a little mean

2726
03:12:54,959 --> 03:12:55,959
and then somebody, you know,

2727
03:12:55,959 --> 03:12:57,959
you collectively can come to an agreement.

2728
03:12:57,959 --> 03:12:59,959
That makes me happy.

2729
03:12:59,959 --> 03:13:04,780
All right.

2730
03:13:04,780 --> 03:13:07,020
So let me...

2731
03:13:07,020 --> 03:13:08,020
Do I have beads?

2732
03:13:08,020 --> 03:13:11,350
All right.

2733
03:13:11,350 --> 03:13:13,350
Divine dragon attack power plus.

2734
03:13:13,549 --> 03:13:15,110
You hear that?

2735
03:13:15,110 --> 03:13:16,110
That's a fresh one.

2736
03:13:16,110 --> 03:13:22,639
I didn't even read it.

2737
03:13:22,639 --> 03:13:23,639
Whatever.

2738
03:13:23,639 --> 03:13:25,069
I gotta go read that.

2739
03:13:25,069 --> 03:13:27,629
I'm interested in the lore.

2740
03:13:27,629 --> 03:13:35,719
Where is it?

2741
03:13:35,719 --> 03:13:39,370
The divine dragon of the Everblossom

2742
03:13:39,370 --> 03:13:41,370
came from the west long ago,

2743
03:13:41,370 --> 03:13:43,370
eventually making its way to this land.

2744
03:13:43,370 --> 03:13:48,319
I got it.

2745
03:13:48,319 --> 03:13:51,010
Some parts of Ashina are exceedingly old,

2746
03:13:51,010 --> 03:13:53,010
water coursing through her ancient rocks

2747
03:13:53,010 --> 03:13:55,010
and so will allow the dragon to take root.

2748
03:13:55,010 --> 03:13:56,010
Okay.

2749
03:13:56,010 --> 03:14:02,430
Cool.

2750
03:14:02,430 --> 03:14:03,430
All right.

2751
03:14:03,430 --> 03:14:05,739
So I'm looking over at the chat

2752
03:14:05,739 --> 03:14:07,739
and I'm getting spammed.

2753
03:14:07,940 --> 03:14:09,940
Just spammed.

2754
03:14:09,940 --> 03:14:10,940
About how...

2755
03:14:10,940 --> 03:14:11,940
Don't!

2756
03:14:11,940 --> 03:14:13,940
Don't!

2757
03:14:13,940 --> 03:14:14,940
Don't go there!

2758
03:14:14,940 --> 03:14:15,940
Wait!

2759
03:14:16,940 --> 03:14:17,940
Wait!

2760
03:14:17,940 --> 03:14:20,940
So what do you want me to do?

2761
03:14:20,940 --> 03:14:26,639
Is it apparently an optional area

2762
03:14:26,639 --> 03:14:36,559
from where?

2763
03:14:36,559 --> 03:14:43,020
Just like from here.

2764
03:14:43,020 --> 03:14:53,989
There's a kite.

2765
03:14:53,989 --> 03:14:54,989
Okay.

2766
03:14:54,989 --> 03:15:06,299
This is the dungeon.

2767
03:15:06,299 --> 03:15:08,299
All these are locked up again.

2768
03:15:08,299 --> 03:15:12,020
So from the dungeon entrance

2769
03:15:12,020 --> 03:15:23,110
it's just from here.

2770
03:15:23,110 --> 03:15:24,110
No way!

2771
03:15:24,110 --> 03:15:26,760
Don't!

2772
03:15:26,959 --> 03:15:36,260
Can I get out of this way?

2773
03:15:36,260 --> 03:15:37,260
No, there's another window, right?

2774
03:15:37,260 --> 03:15:41,360
Let me rest first.

2775
03:15:41,360 --> 03:15:44,819
Turn on smart clicks.

2776
03:15:45,819 --> 03:15:51,639
There's an idol up there.

2777
03:15:51,639 --> 03:15:52,819
All right.

2778
03:15:52,819 --> 03:15:53,819
Here we go.

2779
03:15:53,819 --> 03:15:54,819
There's a door.

2780
03:15:54,819 --> 03:15:56,180
All right.

2781
03:15:56,180 --> 03:15:59,920
Find the...

2782
03:15:59,920 --> 03:16:01,159
All right.

2783
03:16:01,159 --> 03:16:03,159
Well, there's a guy spraying all kinds

2784
03:16:03,159 --> 03:16:04,159
of weird shit down there.

2785
03:16:04,159 --> 03:16:09,559
Hello?

2786
03:16:09,559 --> 03:16:10,559
Where?

2787
03:16:10,559 --> 03:16:18,200
So I'm apparently...

2788
03:16:18,200 --> 03:16:20,950
They're just fighting.

2789
03:16:20,950 --> 03:16:27,250
Oh, look.

2790
03:16:27,250 --> 03:16:31,340
I found the thing that people were yelling about

2791
03:16:31,340 --> 03:16:32,340
and screaming.

2792
03:16:32,340 --> 03:16:35,540
My ears are bleeding.

2793
03:16:35,739 --> 03:16:38,110
Because of how loud the screams were.

2794
03:16:38,110 --> 03:16:46,579
So it's down there.

2795
03:16:46,579 --> 03:16:50,620
Hey-o!

2796
03:16:50,620 --> 03:16:52,940
Just wait until them to fight.

2797
03:16:52,940 --> 03:16:53,940
You kill each other.

2798
03:16:53,940 --> 03:16:54,940
I don't care.

2799
03:16:54,940 --> 03:17:03,159
Why are they fighting each other?

2800
03:17:03,159 --> 03:17:09,260
All right.

2801
03:17:09,260 --> 03:17:10,260
Well, I don't know

2802
03:17:10,260 --> 03:17:11,260
if I wanted you to win or not.

2803
03:17:11,260 --> 03:17:20,250
Okay.

2804
03:17:20,250 --> 03:17:21,549
So...

2805
03:17:21,549 --> 03:17:30,729
Did I...

2806
03:17:30,729 --> 03:17:31,729
Was I supposed to hold on to it?

2807
03:17:31,729 --> 03:17:39,559
I did it.

2808
03:17:39,559 --> 03:17:41,309
Okay.

2809
03:17:41,309 --> 03:17:44,829
Yo, we are perfect!

2810
03:17:44,829 --> 03:17:47,899
Well, let me go get this idol.

2811
03:17:47,899 --> 03:18:04,250
Perfect streamer.

2812
03:18:04,250 --> 03:18:05,250
Okay.

2813
03:18:05,250 --> 03:18:07,579
So then from here

2814
03:18:07,579 --> 03:18:12,379
just go down this way?

2815
03:18:12,579 --> 03:18:15,540
Okay.

2816
03:18:15,540 --> 03:18:20,819
Who just...

2817
03:18:20,819 --> 03:18:21,819
How did...

2818
03:18:21,819 --> 03:18:25,139
Did everybody just see me?

2819
03:18:25,139 --> 03:18:26,139
Which way are they facing?

2820
03:18:26,139 --> 03:18:27,139
No.

2821
03:18:27,139 --> 03:18:32,930
This is just a fight.

2822
03:18:32,930 --> 03:18:33,930
My God.

2823
03:18:33,930 --> 03:18:34,930
Um...

2824
03:18:34,930 --> 03:18:36,930
I'm just gonna hang on the ledge

2825
03:18:36,930 --> 03:18:38,930
and just shimmy across.

2826
03:18:38,930 --> 03:18:39,930
Oh, there's items here.

2827
03:18:39,930 --> 03:18:42,579
Wait.

2828
03:18:42,579 --> 03:18:44,459
What?

2829
03:18:49,049 --> 03:18:50,049
All right.

2830
03:18:50,049 --> 03:18:51,049
Whatever.

2831
03:18:51,049 --> 03:18:56,059
You're killing him.

2832
03:18:56,059 --> 03:18:57,059
Stop.

2833
03:18:57,059 --> 03:18:59,840
All right.

2834
03:18:59,840 --> 03:19:04,659
I've had enough.

2835
03:19:04,659 --> 03:19:07,290
I've had just about enough.

2836
03:19:07,290 --> 03:19:29,069
Die!

2837
03:19:29,069 --> 03:19:30,069
The only guy fighting me!

2838
03:19:30,270 --> 03:19:31,270
It's a fair!

2839
03:19:31,270 --> 03:19:32,270
The guy shooting me!

2840
03:19:32,270 --> 03:19:38,799
If you didn't have a buddy

2841
03:19:38,799 --> 03:19:52,200
I'll not fire from your birthday.

2842
03:19:52,200 --> 03:19:53,200
Happy birthday!

2843
03:19:53,200 --> 03:19:55,950
Hope you have a good one.

2844
03:19:55,950 --> 03:20:02,989
Mystery dowsing powder.

2845
03:20:02,989 --> 03:20:04,360
It heals, burn status.

2846
03:20:04,360 --> 03:20:05,360
Burn, burn, burn, burn.

2847
03:20:05,360 --> 03:20:07,360
Fire, fire, fire, fire.

2848
03:20:07,360 --> 03:20:08,360
Mystery fear to her eyes.

2849
03:20:08,360 --> 03:20:10,360
The bloodshot, the waters of the fire.

2850
03:20:10,360 --> 03:20:12,360
Use this if you don't want to die from fire.

2851
03:20:12,360 --> 03:20:13,360
I got you.

2852
03:20:13,360 --> 03:20:14,360
Great.

2853
03:20:14,360 --> 03:20:15,360
Come on down.

2854
03:20:15,360 --> 03:20:17,049
Remember we talked about

2855
03:20:17,049 --> 03:20:18,049
how I need a fire thing?

2856
03:20:18,049 --> 03:20:20,049
Well, good thing I have it.

2857
03:20:23,430 --> 03:20:27,170
Man.

2858
03:20:27,170 --> 03:20:51,690
These guys have the two blades.

2859
03:20:51,690 --> 03:20:52,690
Really?

2860
03:20:52,690 --> 03:20:54,569
Like what?

2861
03:20:54,569 --> 03:21:07,219
Why do you have a trillion posture?

2862
03:21:07,219 --> 03:21:10,899
Like you have a million posture.

2863
03:21:10,899 --> 03:21:20,909
I got to bring your health down

2864
03:21:20,909 --> 03:21:21,909
to something like this.

2865
03:21:21,909 --> 03:21:23,469
This is fucking ridiculous.

2866
03:21:23,469 --> 03:21:25,469
Look at my posture.

2867
03:21:25,469 --> 03:21:26,469
This is the fucking hardest

2868
03:21:26,469 --> 03:21:30,979
enemy in the game.

2869
03:21:30,979 --> 03:21:34,790
They should upgrade you to boss.

2870
03:21:34,790 --> 03:21:37,180
Fuck off.

2871
03:21:37,180 --> 03:21:38,180
All right.

2872
03:21:38,180 --> 03:21:39,180
This is a big guy killing me.

2873
03:21:39,379 --> 03:21:50,290
Fuck off.

2874
03:21:50,290 --> 03:22:01,959
All right.

2875
03:22:01,959 --> 03:22:02,959
There's a big guy down here.

2876
03:22:02,959 --> 03:22:06,989
There's another one of these

2877
03:22:06,989 --> 03:22:10,739
goddamn dual welders

2878
03:22:10,739 --> 03:22:17,590
with the bane of my existence.

2879
03:22:17,590 --> 03:22:18,590
All right.

2880
03:22:18,590 --> 03:22:19,590
You had your friend

2881
03:22:19,590 --> 03:22:20,590
or your brother

2882
03:22:20,590 --> 03:22:21,590
or your colleague.

2883
03:22:21,590 --> 03:22:22,590
I don't even know

2884
03:22:22,590 --> 03:22:23,590
who the fuck it was.

2885
03:22:23,590 --> 03:22:24,829
Compare the two of you.

2886
03:22:24,829 --> 03:22:25,829
You don't deserve

2887
03:22:25,829 --> 03:22:26,829
to be down there.

2888
03:22:26,829 --> 03:22:33,280
Oh man.

2889
03:22:33,280 --> 03:22:34,280
All right.

2890
03:22:34,280 --> 03:22:36,420
Well, grab.

2891
03:22:36,420 --> 03:22:41,500
Interesting.

2892
03:22:41,500 --> 03:22:45,229
Drinking?

2893
03:22:45,229 --> 03:23:01,229
That's a slo-

2894
03:23:01,229 --> 03:23:02,229
Ah, that's a slo-

2895
03:23:02,229 --> 03:23:03,229
I thought it was a grab.

2896
03:23:03,430 --> 03:23:09,920
Ah.

2897
03:23:09,920 --> 03:23:24,100
Stop spamming block.

2898
03:23:24,100 --> 03:23:26,540
I need to know what he's doing.

2899
03:23:26,540 --> 03:23:29,540
You want me just to let him hit me?

2900
03:23:29,540 --> 03:23:30,840
Or do you want me to block

2901
03:23:30,840 --> 03:23:32,840
and see what he does for a move?

2902
03:23:32,840 --> 03:23:34,079
Ah, just let him hit me.

2903
03:23:34,079 --> 03:23:35,079
That sounds good.

2904
03:23:35,079 --> 03:23:52,739
Oh, this is going to be painful.

2905
03:23:52,739 --> 03:24:01,219
Because I got to go through

2906
03:24:01,219 --> 03:24:03,219
that whole goddamn camp again.

2907
03:24:03,219 --> 03:24:08,040
Fuck.

2908
03:24:08,040 --> 03:24:09,040
I got to go through this whole-

2909
03:24:09,040 --> 03:24:10,040
I can't-

2910
03:24:10,040 --> 03:24:11,040
Can I just sneak in here?

2911
03:24:11,040 --> 03:24:13,040
Ah, shit.

2912
03:24:13,040 --> 03:24:16,840
This is going to be awful.

2913
03:24:16,840 --> 03:24:17,840
I got to go through

2914
03:24:17,840 --> 03:24:18,840
this whole thing again.

2915
03:24:18,840 --> 03:24:27,500
I wonder what happened.

2916
03:24:27,700 --> 03:24:28,700
Okay, wait.

2917
03:24:28,700 --> 03:24:29,700
Hold on.

2918
03:24:29,700 --> 03:24:30,700
Can I, like, listen to you talk now?

2919
03:24:30,700 --> 03:24:33,010
I'm still Ashina Will-

2920
03:24:33,010 --> 03:24:38,020
Okay.

2921
03:24:38,020 --> 03:24:39,020
Um.

2922
03:24:39,020 --> 03:24:43,139
I wonder if I can find

2923
03:24:43,139 --> 03:24:44,139
a way to get around here

2924
03:24:44,139 --> 03:24:45,139
without having to do this every time.

2925
03:24:45,139 --> 03:24:56,319
I'm not in the right place.

2926
03:24:56,319 --> 03:24:57,879
Well, I wonder.

2927
03:24:57,879 --> 03:24:58,879
Is the entire camp

2928
03:24:58,879 --> 03:24:59,879
going to follow me?

2929
03:24:59,879 --> 03:25:00,879
Let's see.

2930
03:25:00,879 --> 03:25:01,879
Let's see how great

2931
03:25:01,879 --> 03:25:02,879
this area is.

2932
03:25:02,879 --> 03:25:06,399
I'm going to aggro the whole camp.

2933
03:25:06,399 --> 03:25:15,260
He's waiting for me?

2934
03:25:15,260 --> 03:25:16,260
Oh, that's not going to work out.

2935
03:25:16,260 --> 03:25:18,260
No way.

2936
03:25:18,260 --> 03:25:19,260
Oh, no way.

2937
03:25:19,260 --> 03:25:20,260
That's no way.

2938
03:25:20,459 --> 03:25:21,459
Everybody here.

2939
03:25:21,459 --> 03:25:27,500
What if I just run by everybody?

2940
03:25:27,500 --> 03:25:33,920
What else is here?

2941
03:25:33,920 --> 03:25:41,510
Is there something else here?

2942
03:25:41,510 --> 03:25:42,510
I guess this-

2943
03:25:42,510 --> 03:25:43,510
I don't have to do this.

2944
03:25:43,510 --> 03:25:55,479
Yeah, I remember this area,

2945
03:25:55,479 --> 03:25:56,479
the pan guy.

2946
03:25:56,479 --> 03:25:58,360
I'm going to just see

2947
03:25:58,360 --> 03:26:02,479
what's over here.

2948
03:26:02,479 --> 03:26:03,479
Oh, shit.

2949
03:26:03,479 --> 03:26:06,899
Okay, that's-

2950
03:26:06,899 --> 03:26:07,899
I need that item.

2951
03:26:07,899 --> 03:26:10,930
Oh, my God.

2952
03:26:10,930 --> 03:26:14,790
Jesus Christ.

2953
03:26:14,790 --> 03:26:15,790
This is crazy.

2954
03:26:15,790 --> 03:26:16,790
The way it does

2955
03:26:16,790 --> 03:26:19,180
is an idol up there.

2956
03:26:19,180 --> 03:26:20,180
Get up there.

2957
03:26:20,180 --> 03:26:21,180
Come on.

2958
03:26:21,180 --> 03:26:26,940
Oh, my God.

2959
03:26:26,940 --> 03:26:27,940
I can do it.

2960
03:26:32,729 --> 03:26:37,620
And I fell off.

2961
03:26:37,620 --> 03:26:38,620
I wonder if this

2962
03:26:38,620 --> 03:26:47,540
is an optional area.

2963
03:26:47,540 --> 03:26:48,540
I didn't-

2964
03:26:48,540 --> 03:26:49,540
How the fuck

2965
03:26:49,540 --> 03:26:50,540
am I supposed to know

2966
03:26:50,540 --> 03:26:51,540
you're up there?

2967
03:26:51,540 --> 03:26:52,540
Where is this-

2968
03:26:52,540 --> 03:26:53,540
Why am I locked onto this guy?

2969
03:26:53,540 --> 03:27:06,700
Oh, fuck this place.

2970
03:27:06,700 --> 03:27:20,739
Okay.

2971
03:27:20,739 --> 03:27:28,059
So, what the fuck

2972
03:27:28,059 --> 03:27:29,059
am I supposed to do now?

2973
03:27:29,059 --> 03:27:33,239
Well, I didn't mean

2974
03:27:33,239 --> 03:27:34,239
to do that.

2975
03:27:34,239 --> 03:27:37,209
Well, that was-

2976
03:27:37,209 --> 03:27:38,209
All right, I'm going to

2977
03:27:38,209 --> 03:27:39,209
go this way.

2978
03:27:39,209 --> 03:27:57,409
That's not an item.

2979
03:27:57,409 --> 03:28:17,719
Wait, where?

2980
03:28:17,719 --> 03:28:33,420
Oh, God.

2981
03:28:33,420 --> 03:28:38,139
Where did you come from?

2982
03:28:38,139 --> 03:28:50,700
Okay.

2983
03:28:50,899 --> 03:28:55,430
That wasn't terrible, but-

2984
03:28:55,430 --> 03:29:07,270
Oh, there's a lot over here, huh?

2985
03:29:07,270 --> 03:29:08,270
One guy on the road.

2986
03:29:08,270 --> 03:29:15,399
Ah.

2987
03:29:15,399 --> 03:29:19,260
I look over here.

2988
03:29:19,260 --> 03:29:20,260
Jeremiah, I think you're

2989
03:29:20,260 --> 03:29:21,260
making a very

2990
03:29:21,260 --> 03:29:22,260
prognitorial boss

2991
03:29:22,260 --> 03:29:23,260
can be challenging.

2992
03:29:23,260 --> 03:29:24,260
Take your time

2993
03:29:24,260 --> 03:29:25,260
and have fun with the game.

2994
03:29:25,260 --> 03:29:26,260
I'm glad you're trying

2995
03:29:26,260 --> 03:29:27,260
out your first

2996
03:29:27,260 --> 03:29:28,260
Soulsborne game.

2997
03:29:28,260 --> 03:29:29,260
It's-

2998
03:29:29,260 --> 03:29:30,260
We're still on-

2999
03:29:30,260 --> 03:29:31,260
All right, now you got me

3000
03:29:31,260 --> 03:29:32,260
all fucked up

3001
03:29:32,260 --> 03:29:34,260
because I had to read that.

3002
03:29:34,260 --> 03:29:38,340
Oh, God damn it.

3003
03:29:38,340 --> 03:29:41,049
I fucked it all up,

3004
03:29:41,049 --> 03:29:42,049
because I-

3005
03:29:42,049 --> 03:29:43,049
All right, I'm never reading

3006
03:29:43,049 --> 03:29:44,049
chat ever again.

3007
03:29:50,629 --> 03:29:51,629
I got the whole fucking

3008
03:29:51,629 --> 03:29:59,120
village after me now.

3009
03:29:59,120 --> 03:30:00,120
Oh, man.

3010
03:30:00,120 --> 03:30:01,120
Oh, there's no-

3011
03:30:01,120 --> 03:30:02,120
Nowhere is safe.

3012
03:30:02,120 --> 03:30:09,930
Oh, Jesus Christ.

3013
03:30:09,930 --> 03:30:11,940
Oh, my God.

3014
03:30:11,940 --> 03:30:12,940
There's a chest.

3015
03:30:12,940 --> 03:30:14,430
No.

3016
03:30:14,430 --> 03:30:15,430
Nowhere is safe.

3017
03:30:15,430 --> 03:30:16,430
Nowhere is safe.

3018
03:30:16,430 --> 03:30:19,399
Whoa.

3019
03:30:19,399 --> 03:30:32,739
Oh, no way.

3020
03:30:32,739 --> 03:30:33,739
Oh.

3021
03:30:33,739 --> 03:30:34,739
Is there a

3022
03:30:34,739 --> 03:30:35,739
chained ogre here?

3023
03:30:35,739 --> 03:30:36,739
Are you sure that

3024
03:30:36,739 --> 03:30:37,739
they're not just

3025
03:30:37,739 --> 03:30:38,739
spawning in random

3026
03:30:38,739 --> 03:30:39,739
enemies of this zone?

3027
03:30:39,739 --> 03:30:40,739
That guy didn't even

3028
03:30:40,739 --> 03:30:41,739
try to fight me.

3029
03:30:41,739 --> 03:30:42,739
He just fucking

3030
03:30:42,739 --> 03:30:43,739
walking around.

3031
03:30:43,739 --> 03:30:46,899
That wasn't even-

3032
03:30:46,899 --> 03:30:47,899
That guy didn't even

3033
03:30:47,899 --> 03:30:48,899
try to fight me.

3034
03:30:48,899 --> 03:30:54,170
This is just an

3035
03:30:54,170 --> 03:30:55,170
optional war zone.

3036
03:30:55,170 --> 03:30:56,170
I don't-

3037
03:30:56,170 --> 03:30:57,170
I don't know-

3038
03:30:57,170 --> 03:30:58,170
I don't know

3039
03:30:58,170 --> 03:31:04,459
where I'm going.

3040
03:31:04,459 --> 03:31:05,459
Um, it's-

3041
03:31:05,459 --> 03:31:06,459
In there?

3042
03:31:06,459 --> 03:31:07,459
What is in there?

3043
03:31:07,459 --> 03:31:10,299
This is where I

3044
03:31:10,299 --> 03:31:11,299
fought the bull, right?

3045
03:31:11,299 --> 03:31:13,950
Oh, my God.

3046
03:31:13,950 --> 03:31:14,950
Wait, there's an

3047
03:31:14,950 --> 03:31:15,950
idol right here.

3048
03:31:15,950 --> 03:31:21,670
What-

3049
03:31:21,670 --> 03:31:27,459
Wait, where am I going?

3050
03:31:27,459 --> 03:31:28,459
Wait, what the fuck

3051
03:31:28,459 --> 03:31:29,459
is going on?

3052
03:31:29,459 --> 03:31:41,959
Are they-

3053
03:31:41,959 --> 03:31:42,959
There's random

3054
03:31:42,959 --> 03:31:43,959
enemies in here.

3055
03:31:43,959 --> 03:31:44,959
There's random

3056
03:31:44,959 --> 03:32:06,780
monster in here.

3057
03:32:06,780 --> 03:32:10,659
Demon of hatred.

3058
03:32:13,309 --> 03:32:16,309
He's got three bars.

3059
03:32:16,309 --> 03:32:17,309
Oh, boy.

3060
03:32:17,309 --> 03:32:18,309
Here we go.

3061
03:32:18,309 --> 03:32:21,379
All right.

3062
03:32:21,379 --> 03:32:22,379
You look like a

3063
03:32:22,379 --> 03:32:23,379
Dark Souls-

3064
03:32:23,379 --> 03:32:24,379
Souls-born

3065
03:32:24,379 --> 03:32:25,379
boss.

3066
03:32:25,379 --> 03:32:26,379
What do you got?

3067
03:32:26,379 --> 03:32:27,620
That's

3068
03:32:27,620 --> 03:32:28,620
pretty good.

3069
03:32:28,620 --> 03:32:29,989
You got a

3070
03:32:29,989 --> 03:32:30,989
firearm.

3071
03:32:30,989 --> 03:32:38,500
Okay.

3072
03:32:38,500 --> 03:32:39,500
I can-

3073
03:32:39,500 --> 03:32:40,500
I get you in the

3074
03:32:40,500 --> 03:32:43,729
hand.

3075
03:32:43,729 --> 03:32:44,729
Definitely-

3076
03:32:44,729 --> 03:32:45,729
I don't know if I want

3077
03:32:45,729 --> 03:32:46,729
to parry his

3078
03:32:46,729 --> 03:32:47,729
fire-like

3079
03:32:47,729 --> 03:33:02,469
swirly arm.

3080
03:33:02,469 --> 03:33:03,469
That's a-

3081
03:33:03,469 --> 03:33:04,469
Okay, that's

3082
03:33:04,469 --> 03:33:05,469
classified as a sweep.

3083
03:33:06,469 --> 03:33:07,469
Holy shit.

3084
03:33:07,469 --> 03:33:08,469
What the hell am I

3085
03:33:08,469 --> 03:33:09,469
supposed to do about

3086
03:33:09,469 --> 03:33:10,469
that?

3087
03:33:10,469 --> 03:33:11,469
I wonder if I should

3088
03:33:11,469 --> 03:33:25,700
just dodge.

3089
03:33:25,700 --> 03:33:27,069
If I

3090
03:33:27,069 --> 03:33:28,069
not, though.

3091
03:33:28,069 --> 03:33:36,340
Grab him.

3092
03:33:36,340 --> 03:33:37,340
Show me your

3093
03:33:37,340 --> 03:33:38,340
moves, please.

3094
03:33:38,340 --> 03:33:39,340
I want to see if

3095
03:33:39,340 --> 03:33:46,020
you can-

3096
03:33:46,020 --> 03:33:47,020
Good thing there's an

3097
03:33:47,020 --> 03:34:00,610
idol right here.

3098
03:34:00,610 --> 03:34:01,610
Is he-

3099
03:34:01,610 --> 03:34:02,610
Wow, that's an

3100
03:34:02,610 --> 03:34:03,610
enormous hitbox.

3101
03:34:03,610 --> 03:34:04,610
Holy shit.

3102
03:34:04,610 --> 03:34:11,899
Oh, my

3103
03:34:11,899 --> 03:34:12,899
goodness gracious.

3104
03:34:12,899 --> 03:34:13,899
Okay.

3105
03:34:13,899 --> 03:34:14,899
Well, a couple of

3106
03:34:14,899 --> 03:34:16,139
things that are very

3107
03:34:16,139 --> 03:34:23,340
clear here.

3108
03:34:23,340 --> 03:34:24,340
No, this is only

3109
03:34:24,340 --> 03:34:25,340
magnetic.

3110
03:34:25,340 --> 03:34:26,340
Red.

3111
03:34:26,340 --> 03:34:27,829
So it was-

3112
03:34:27,829 --> 03:34:28,829
No.

3113
03:34:28,829 --> 03:34:29,829
Uh, fire

3114
03:34:29,829 --> 03:34:30,829
gourd.

3115
03:34:30,829 --> 03:34:32,139
There is it.

3116
03:34:32,139 --> 03:34:33,139
Reduces burn

3117
03:34:33,139 --> 03:34:34,139
buildup.

3118
03:34:34,139 --> 03:34:35,700
Is he gonna

3119
03:34:35,700 --> 03:34:36,700
drink it

3120
03:34:36,700 --> 03:34:37,700
whenever it's

3121
03:34:37,700 --> 03:34:42,969
available?

3122
03:34:42,969 --> 03:34:43,969
Alright.

3123
03:34:43,969 --> 03:34:57,239
Let me try-

3124
03:34:57,239 --> 03:34:58,239
Let me just

3125
03:34:58,239 --> 03:34:59,239
get-

3126
03:34:59,239 --> 03:35:00,239
Let me just see

3127
03:35:00,239 --> 03:35:01,239
it again.

3128
03:35:01,239 --> 03:35:07,020
Let me fight you

3129
03:35:07,020 --> 03:35:08,020
like a-

3130
03:35:08,020 --> 03:35:09,020
Let me fight you

3131
03:35:09,020 --> 03:35:10,020
like a fucking

3132
03:35:10,020 --> 03:35:11,020
dark soul boss.

3133
03:35:11,020 --> 03:35:12,020
Jesus!

3134
03:35:12,020 --> 03:35:25,170
He just does it-

3135
03:35:25,170 --> 03:35:26,170
Wow!

3136
03:35:26,170 --> 03:35:28,940
Wow!

3137
03:35:28,940 --> 03:35:29,940
That's a

3138
03:35:29,940 --> 03:35:30,940
one-hit kill.

3139
03:35:30,940 --> 03:35:34,870
That-

3140
03:35:34,870 --> 03:35:35,870
Look at that

3141
03:35:35,870 --> 03:35:37,239
hitbox.

3142
03:35:37,239 --> 03:35:38,239
Did you see how

3143
03:35:38,239 --> 03:35:39,239
big that hitbox was?

3144
03:35:39,239 --> 03:35:40,239
There could have

3145
03:35:40,239 --> 03:35:49,610
been seven of us

3146
03:35:49,610 --> 03:35:52,260
lined up there.

3147
03:35:52,260 --> 03:35:53,260
Ooh.

3148
03:35:53,260 --> 03:35:54,260
Hey, this is

3149
03:35:54,260 --> 03:35:55,260
the only-

3150
03:35:55,260 --> 03:35:56,260
Let's just

3151
03:35:56,260 --> 03:36:01,850
keep getting

3152
03:36:01,850 --> 03:36:02,850
harassed kicked.

3153
03:36:02,850 --> 03:36:13,299
Let's go.

3154
03:36:13,299 --> 03:36:14,299
Let's try to

3155
03:36:14,299 --> 03:36:15,299
take it slow this

3156
03:36:15,299 --> 03:36:16,299
time.

3157
03:36:16,299 --> 03:36:17,299
You gotta run

3158
03:36:17,299 --> 03:36:20,340
underneath that.

3159
03:36:20,340 --> 03:36:21,340
Once he queues up

3160
03:36:21,340 --> 03:36:22,340
that, you gotta

3161
03:36:22,340 --> 03:36:23,340
run.

3162
03:36:23,340 --> 03:36:24,340
Oh, boy.

3163
03:36:24,340 --> 03:36:25,340
That-

3164
03:36:25,340 --> 03:36:26,340
The arm is

3165
03:36:26,340 --> 03:36:27,340
so weird

3166
03:36:27,340 --> 03:36:28,340
because it's so

3167
03:36:28,340 --> 03:36:29,340
squiggly.

3168
03:36:29,340 --> 03:36:32,430
That's the

3169
03:36:32,430 --> 03:36:33,430
problem, man.

3170
03:36:33,430 --> 03:36:34,430
Look at this

3171
03:36:34,430 --> 03:36:43,100
thing.

3172
03:36:43,100 --> 03:36:44,100
Maybe-

3173
03:36:44,100 --> 03:36:45,100
I'm just gonna-

3174
03:36:45,100 --> 03:36:46,100
Maybe just

3175
03:36:46,100 --> 03:36:48,040
run behind him

3176
03:36:48,040 --> 03:36:49,040
to stay all the

3177
03:36:49,040 --> 03:36:50,040
way behind him.

3178
03:36:50,040 --> 03:36:51,040
Don't even

3179
03:36:51,040 --> 03:36:52,040
let him give him a

3180
03:36:52,040 --> 03:36:53,040
chance to, like,

3181
03:36:53,040 --> 03:36:54,409
touch you.

3182
03:36:54,409 --> 03:36:55,409
He's gonna try

3183
03:36:55,409 --> 03:37:00,549
to do it, but

3184
03:37:00,549 --> 03:37:01,549
maybe-

3185
03:37:01,549 --> 03:37:12,709
Can I get in there

3186
03:37:12,709 --> 03:37:19,649
quickly?

3187
03:37:19,649 --> 03:37:20,649
I can't go

3188
03:37:20,649 --> 03:37:21,649
through his

3189
03:37:21,649 --> 03:37:27,620
legs.

3190
03:37:27,620 --> 03:37:28,620
What is this?

3191
03:37:28,620 --> 03:37:34,340
Jesus.

3192
03:37:34,340 --> 03:37:35,340
Oh-ho-ho.

3193
03:37:35,340 --> 03:37:36,340
Damn.

3194
03:37:36,340 --> 03:37:37,340
All right.

3195
03:37:37,340 --> 03:37:38,899
I'm gonna-

3196
03:37:38,899 --> 03:37:39,899
This is crazy.

3197
03:37:39,899 --> 03:37:40,899
Oh,

3198
03:37:40,899 --> 03:37:44,000
leave the fuck away.

3199
03:37:44,000 --> 03:37:45,000
Like that.

3200
03:37:45,000 --> 03:37:46,000
Not good.

3201
03:37:46,000 --> 03:37:48,579
Come on.

3202
03:37:48,579 --> 03:37:49,579
I can't attach

3203
03:37:49,579 --> 03:37:50,579
to him.

3204
03:37:50,579 --> 03:37:51,579
See, when he-

3205
03:37:51,579 --> 03:37:52,579
When he gets in front

3206
03:37:52,579 --> 03:37:53,950
of you, that's, like,

3207
03:37:53,950 --> 03:37:59,610
the worst part.

3208
03:37:59,610 --> 03:38:00,610
You gotta stay

3209
03:38:00,610 --> 03:38:01,610
with him.

3210
03:38:01,610 --> 03:38:02,610
Jesus.

3211
03:38:02,610 --> 03:38:03,610
He gets so

3212
03:38:03,610 --> 03:38:07,219
much range on you,

3213
03:38:07,219 --> 03:38:08,219
and then it's, like,

3214
03:38:08,219 --> 03:38:10,030
silly spring on him.

3215
03:38:10,030 --> 03:38:11,030
See you later.

3216
03:38:11,030 --> 03:38:12,030
There's gotta be a

3217
03:38:12,030 --> 03:38:13,030
way I can get

3218
03:38:13,030 --> 03:38:14,030
the fucker right.

3219
03:38:14,030 --> 03:38:15,030
Guess not.

3220
03:38:15,030 --> 03:38:17,680
What the fuck are

3221
03:38:17,680 --> 03:38:18,680
you supposed to do

3222
03:38:18,680 --> 03:38:19,680
against those?

3223
03:38:19,680 --> 03:38:25,850
Shit.

3224
03:38:25,850 --> 03:38:35,659
They take up, like,

3225
03:38:35,659 --> 03:38:36,659
the whole screen.

3226
03:38:36,659 --> 03:38:41,100
Jesus.

3227
03:38:41,100 --> 03:38:42,100
Run straight through,

3228
03:38:42,100 --> 03:38:43,100
I'm thinking.

3229
03:38:43,100 --> 03:38:51,059
I'm thinking run

3230
03:38:51,059 --> 03:38:52,059
straight through those.

3231
03:38:52,059 --> 03:38:59,579
All right.

3232
03:38:59,579 --> 03:39:00,579
Run straight.

3233
03:39:00,579 --> 03:39:01,579
He's gonna throw

3234
03:39:01,579 --> 03:39:02,579
the fireballs.

3235
03:39:02,579 --> 03:39:03,579
I think I can go

3236
03:39:03,579 --> 03:39:04,579
right underneath him.

3237
03:39:04,579 --> 03:39:05,940
Yup.

3238
03:39:05,940 --> 03:39:06,940
All right.

3239
03:39:06,940 --> 03:39:07,940
It's just figuring it out.

3240
03:39:07,940 --> 03:39:08,940
It's just figuring

3241
03:39:08,940 --> 03:39:22,090
that shit out.

3242
03:39:22,090 --> 03:39:33,120
We go again.

3243
03:39:33,120 --> 03:39:34,120
Oh, yeah.

3244
03:39:34,120 --> 03:39:35,120
At least I didn't get hit.

3245
03:39:35,120 --> 03:39:36,120
All right.

3246
03:39:36,120 --> 03:39:44,530
First phase is kind of-

3247
03:39:44,530 --> 03:39:45,530
I'm figuring

3248
03:39:45,530 --> 03:39:46,530
this shit out.

3249
03:39:46,530 --> 03:39:48,340
Ooh, that hurts a lot.

3250
03:39:48,340 --> 03:39:49,340
Damn it.

3251
03:39:49,340 --> 03:39:50,520
Oh, my God.

3252
03:39:50,520 --> 03:39:51,520
That does so much damage.

3253
03:39:51,520 --> 03:39:52,520
Oh, that's, like,

3254
03:39:52,520 --> 03:39:53,520
almost-

3255
03:39:53,520 --> 03:39:55,590
That's, like,

3256
03:39:55,590 --> 03:39:56,590
almost 80 percent

3257
03:39:56,590 --> 03:39:57,590
of your whole health bar.

3258
03:39:57,590 --> 03:39:58,829
Fuck.

3259
03:39:58,829 --> 03:40:08,709
Oh.

3260
03:40:08,709 --> 03:40:09,709
Slowly but surely,

3261
03:40:09,709 --> 03:40:10,709
I'm figuring it out.

3262
03:40:10,709 --> 03:40:15,920
You know what I mean?

3263
03:40:15,920 --> 03:40:16,920
Let's get an

3264
03:40:16,920 --> 03:40:17,920
actual attempt with

3265
03:40:17,920 --> 03:40:18,920
me not getting

3266
03:40:18,920 --> 03:40:19,920
hit by the fireballs.

3267
03:40:19,920 --> 03:40:21,479
That's a-

3268
03:40:21,479 --> 03:40:37,700
That's a big deal.

3269
03:40:37,700 --> 03:40:38,700
Here comes fireballs.

3270
03:40:38,700 --> 03:40:54,020
Oh, fuck.

3271
03:40:54,020 --> 03:40:55,020
I thought it was

3272
03:40:55,020 --> 03:40:56,020
a little bit longer

3273
03:40:56,020 --> 03:40:57,020
than that.

3274
03:40:57,020 --> 03:40:58,190
That's all right.

3275
03:40:58,190 --> 03:40:59,190
That's not good.

3276
03:40:59,190 --> 03:41:00,190
Yeah, I was

3277
03:41:00,190 --> 03:41:01,190
fucked there.

3278
03:41:01,190 --> 03:41:02,190
So I thought,

3279
03:41:02,190 --> 03:41:03,190
in my brain,

3280
03:41:03,190 --> 03:41:04,190
when he does the belly

3281
03:41:04,190 --> 03:41:05,190
flop, I thought

3282
03:41:05,190 --> 03:41:06,190
maybe I could

3283
03:41:06,190 --> 03:41:07,190
hold onto it.

3284
03:41:07,190 --> 03:41:08,190
But last time,

3285
03:41:08,190 --> 03:41:09,190
it still hit me.

3286
03:41:09,190 --> 03:41:14,979
That right there,

3287
03:41:14,979 --> 03:41:15,979
that right there,

3288
03:41:15,979 --> 03:41:16,979
that,

3289
03:41:16,979 --> 03:41:17,979
that little, like,

3290
03:41:17,979 --> 03:41:18,979
whip.

3291
03:41:18,979 --> 03:41:19,979
He does, like,

3292
03:41:19,979 --> 03:41:20,979
a tiny little jab,

3293
03:41:20,979 --> 03:41:21,979
and it's a massive,

3294
03:41:21,979 --> 03:41:22,979
fucking awful thing

3295
03:41:22,979 --> 03:41:23,979
you have to avoid.

3296
03:41:23,979 --> 03:41:29,120
If I'm going to try

3297
03:41:29,120 --> 03:41:30,120
to stay next to that leg,

3298
03:41:30,120 --> 03:41:36,989
then I've got to

3299
03:41:36,989 --> 03:41:37,989
be ready to

3300
03:41:37,989 --> 03:41:38,989
dodge straight through that.

3301
03:41:38,989 --> 03:41:52,899
Bro?

3302
03:41:52,899 --> 03:41:53,899
Oh, this is

3303
03:41:53,899 --> 03:42:00,459
a bad place to be.

3304
03:42:00,459 --> 03:42:01,459
This-

3305
03:42:01,459 --> 03:42:02,459
This, I couldn't

3306
03:42:02,459 --> 03:42:03,459
pick a worse place

3307
03:42:03,459 --> 03:42:04,459
to be right now.

3308
03:42:04,459 --> 03:42:05,459
Fuck it.

3309
03:42:05,459 --> 03:42:06,459
Of course he has to-

3310
03:42:06,459 --> 03:42:07,459
Of course he goes

3311
03:42:07,459 --> 03:42:08,459
all the way back here.

3312
03:42:08,459 --> 03:42:09,459
Like, look at him.

3313
03:42:09,459 --> 03:42:10,459
Like, get out of here.

3314
03:42:10,459 --> 03:42:11,459
Like, why?

3315
03:42:11,459 --> 03:42:12,459
Get the fuck out of there.

3316
03:42:12,459 --> 03:42:13,459
Because if I-

3317
03:42:13,459 --> 03:42:14,459
I have to run over there

3318
03:42:14,459 --> 03:42:15,459
to make him do anything,

3319
03:42:15,459 --> 03:42:16,459
and now he's going to

3320
03:42:16,459 --> 03:42:17,459
throw the fire at me.

3321
03:42:17,459 --> 03:42:21,260
It's such a huge,

3322
03:42:21,260 --> 03:42:22,260
open area.

3323
03:42:22,260 --> 03:42:23,260
How do you get stuck

3324
03:42:23,260 --> 03:42:24,260
in the wall?

3325
03:42:24,260 --> 03:42:26,260
This is the biggest area

3326
03:42:26,260 --> 03:42:28,260
of any Souls game.

3327
03:42:28,260 --> 03:42:29,260
Besides maybe Orphan.

3328
03:42:29,260 --> 03:42:58,659
And you go into the corner.

3329
03:42:58,659 --> 03:43:00,659
Oh my goodness.

3330
03:43:00,659 --> 03:43:09,829
Two steps.

3331
03:43:09,829 --> 03:43:39,100
There we go.

3332
03:43:39,100 --> 03:43:45,659
Nah, I'll get

3333
03:43:45,659 --> 03:43:46,659
me the fuck out of here.

3334
03:43:46,659 --> 03:43:47,659
No corner, no corner,

3335
03:43:47,659 --> 03:43:48,659
no corner, corner, corner.

3336
03:43:48,659 --> 03:43:49,659
Here comes.

3337
03:43:49,659 --> 03:43:52,500
See?

3338
03:43:52,500 --> 03:43:53,500
I have to jump twice.

3339
03:43:53,500 --> 03:43:54,500
There he is.

3340
03:43:54,500 --> 03:44:02,200
He does it twice,

3341
03:44:02,200 --> 03:44:03,200
and the step.

3342
03:44:03,200 --> 03:44:04,200
Oh.

3343
03:44:04,200 --> 03:44:05,200
Damn, he does like

3344
03:44:05,200 --> 03:44:06,379
four moves in a row there.

3345
03:44:06,379 --> 03:44:07,379
Fuck.

3346
03:44:07,379 --> 03:44:08,379
This fucking silly string.

3347
03:44:08,379 --> 03:44:09,379
Oh my god, please.

3348
03:44:09,379 --> 03:44:14,010
Dude, I don't even know

3349
03:44:14,010 --> 03:44:15,010
what he-

3350
03:44:15,010 --> 03:44:16,010
What the fuck

3351
03:44:16,010 --> 03:44:17,010
he's even doing for moves.

3352
03:44:17,010 --> 03:44:20,299
He's kind of just

3353
03:44:20,299 --> 03:44:21,299
ripping his body in circles.

3354
03:44:21,299 --> 03:44:22,299
And his arm is doing

3355
03:44:22,299 --> 03:44:23,299
the rest of the work.

3356
03:44:23,299 --> 03:44:24,299
Not very good telegraph,

3357
03:44:24,299 --> 03:44:25,299
so.

3358
03:44:25,299 --> 03:44:26,299
What's this?

3359
03:44:26,299 --> 03:44:27,299
Well, I got him down

3360
03:44:27,299 --> 03:44:28,299
to his lowest point,

3361
03:44:28,299 --> 03:44:29,299
and he's like,

3362
03:44:29,299 --> 03:44:32,200
oh my god.

3363
03:44:32,200 --> 03:44:33,200
Oh my god.

3364
03:44:33,200 --> 03:44:34,200
Oh my god.

3365
03:44:34,200 --> 03:44:37,549
Oh my god.

3366
03:44:37,549 --> 03:44:38,549
I got him down

3367
03:44:38,549 --> 03:44:39,549
to as low as I've got him ever.

3368
03:44:39,549 --> 03:45:07,100
It's that,

3369
03:45:07,100 --> 03:45:08,100
it's the close swipe it is.

3370
03:45:08,100 --> 03:45:10,229
Well, it's not gonna die.

3371
03:45:10,229 --> 03:45:11,229
That's gonna happen, man.

3372
03:45:11,229 --> 03:45:12,229
This is,

3373
03:45:12,229 --> 03:45:13,229
this boss has got,

3374
03:45:13,229 --> 03:45:14,229
so I got three phases

3375
03:45:14,229 --> 03:45:15,229
with this dude.

3376
03:45:15,229 --> 03:45:24,729
Let me see if I can just get,

3377
03:45:24,729 --> 03:45:25,729
I wanna try to get him down

3378
03:45:25,729 --> 03:45:26,729
by two and one.

3379
03:45:26,729 --> 03:45:27,729
See what he does

3380
03:45:27,729 --> 03:45:28,729
in the next phase.

3381
03:45:28,729 --> 03:45:29,729
Like, I'll get in here.

3382
03:45:29,729 --> 03:45:52,729
Let's go.

3383
03:45:52,729 --> 03:45:53,729
When you get

3384
03:45:53,729 --> 03:45:54,729
a certain amount of range,

3385
03:45:54,729 --> 03:45:55,729
he does that crazy

3386
03:45:55,729 --> 03:45:56,729
move set there.

3387
03:45:56,729 --> 03:46:08,399
To the corner again.

3388
03:46:08,399 --> 03:46:09,399
God, what's this?

3389
03:46:09,399 --> 03:46:10,399
What's my luck?

3390
03:46:10,399 --> 03:46:11,399
Come on.

3391
03:46:11,399 --> 03:46:15,969
Back it up.

3392
03:46:15,969 --> 03:46:16,969
I ain't gonna have that happen.

3393
03:46:16,969 --> 03:46:19,360
Fuck, I thought he

3394
03:46:19,360 --> 03:46:20,360
was throwing balls.

3395
03:46:20,360 --> 03:46:22,049
Fuck.

3396
03:46:22,049 --> 03:46:31,540
Oh my god.

3397
03:46:31,540 --> 03:46:33,540
Of course he does it there.

3398
03:46:33,540 --> 03:46:34,540
Really?

3399
03:46:34,540 --> 03:46:51,639
No way.

3400
03:46:51,639 --> 03:46:52,639
That's the first time

3401
03:46:52,639 --> 03:46:53,639
that's happened.

3402
03:46:53,639 --> 03:46:54,639
It's because I was coming

3403
03:46:54,639 --> 03:46:55,639
down an incline.

3404
03:46:55,639 --> 03:46:56,639
Oh my lord.

3405
03:46:56,639 --> 03:46:59,219
It's because I've

3406
03:46:59,219 --> 03:47:00,219
gone down an incline.

3407
03:47:00,219 --> 03:47:06,709
Yeah.

3408
03:47:06,709 --> 03:47:07,709
All right.

3409
03:47:07,709 --> 03:47:14,180
One more try.

3410
03:47:14,180 --> 03:47:15,180
And then I'm gonna go,

3411
03:47:15,180 --> 03:47:16,180
come back.

3412
03:47:16,180 --> 03:47:18,129
I want new items.

3413
03:47:18,129 --> 03:47:19,129
And I still got hit by it.

3414
03:47:19,129 --> 03:47:20,129
Oh, that's helpful.

3415
03:47:20,129 --> 03:47:25,270
Like, what?

3416
03:47:25,270 --> 03:47:26,270
Really?

3417
03:47:26,270 --> 03:47:27,270
I still got hit by that?

3418
03:47:27,270 --> 03:47:28,270
What was that?

3419
03:47:28,270 --> 03:47:29,270
It was like a fucking

3420
03:47:29,270 --> 03:47:30,270
two second residual hitbox?

3421
03:47:30,270 --> 03:47:31,270
This guy may as well

3422
03:47:31,270 --> 03:47:32,270
be hitting me with a fucking

3423
03:47:32,270 --> 03:47:33,270
giant square.

3424
03:47:33,270 --> 03:47:34,270
He's got a giant flaming

3425
03:47:34,270 --> 03:47:43,180
square on his head.

3426
03:47:43,180 --> 03:47:44,180
Oh.

3427
03:47:44,180 --> 03:47:45,180
There it is.

3428
03:47:45,180 --> 03:47:46,180
There's a twice.

3429
03:47:46,180 --> 03:47:47,180
And he stomps.

3430
03:47:47,180 --> 03:47:48,180
Fuck.

3431
03:47:48,180 --> 03:47:49,180
Oh.

3432
03:47:49,180 --> 03:48:08,399
Two stomps.

3433
03:48:08,399 --> 03:48:20,459
He's got such

3434
03:48:20,459 --> 03:48:21,459
a difficult move set

3435
03:48:21,459 --> 03:48:22,459
to fucking telegraph.

3436
03:48:22,459 --> 03:48:23,459
It really is ridiculous.

3437
03:48:23,459 --> 03:48:24,700
Sometimes he stomps twice.

3438
03:48:24,700 --> 03:48:31,250
Oh yeah, yikes.

3439
03:48:31,250 --> 03:48:32,250
I'll get it though.

3440
03:48:32,250 --> 03:48:34,190
It'll take me a while.

3441
03:48:35,190 --> 03:48:36,190
I didn't jump?

3442
03:48:36,190 --> 03:48:37,190
I mean, I'm in the air.

3443
03:48:37,190 --> 03:48:38,190
I was...

3444
03:48:38,190 --> 03:48:39,190
You guys saw that.

3445
03:48:39,190 --> 03:48:40,190
I'm in the fucking

3446
03:48:40,190 --> 03:48:41,190
goddamn air.

3447
03:48:41,190 --> 03:48:42,190
Back up.

3448
03:48:42,190 --> 03:48:43,190
Two stomps.

3449
03:48:43,190 --> 03:48:44,190
Fuck.

3450
03:48:44,190 --> 03:48:45,190
I thought it was the balls.

3451
03:48:45,190 --> 03:48:59,809
Oh, man.

3452
03:48:59,809 --> 03:49:00,809
What?

3453
03:49:00,809 --> 03:49:01,809
No.

3454
03:49:01,809 --> 03:49:02,979
Come on.

3455
03:49:02,979 --> 03:49:03,979
What the fuck?

3456
03:49:03,979 --> 03:49:04,979
Do I have five more

3457
03:49:04,979 --> 03:49:35,020
seconds?

3458
03:49:35,020 --> 03:49:36,260
No.

3459
03:49:36,260 --> 03:49:37,260
Fuck.

3460
03:49:37,260 --> 03:49:41,700
Fuck.

3461
03:49:41,700 --> 03:49:42,700
Fuck.

3462
03:49:42,700 --> 03:49:44,329
Fuck.

3463
03:49:44,329 --> 03:49:45,329
Fuck.

3464
03:49:45,329 --> 03:49:46,329
Fuck.

3465
03:49:46,329 --> 03:49:49,680
Fuck.

3466
03:49:49,680 --> 03:49:50,680
Fuck.

3467
03:49:50,680 --> 03:49:51,680
Fuck.

3468
03:49:51,680 --> 03:49:52,680
Fuck.

3469
03:49:52,680 --> 03:49:54,819
Fuck.

3470
03:49:54,819 --> 03:49:55,819
Fuck.

3471
03:49:55,819 --> 03:49:59,170
Fuck.

3472
03:49:59,170 --> 03:50:00,170
Do I have 500 ping?

3473
03:50:00,170 --> 03:50:17,729
That's actually fucking

3474
03:50:17,729 --> 03:50:18,729
infuriating.

3475
03:50:18,729 --> 03:50:19,729
The dream of maybe

3476
03:50:19,729 --> 03:50:20,729
taking him down

3477
03:50:20,729 --> 03:50:21,729
is still possible.

3478
03:50:21,729 --> 03:50:35,129
Oh, fuck.

3479
03:50:35,129 --> 03:50:36,129
Here it comes.

3480
03:50:36,129 --> 03:50:37,129
He's gonna throw it.

3481
03:50:37,129 --> 03:50:52,319
Oh, he's so close to one.

3482
03:50:52,319 --> 03:50:54,319
Firecrack is worthless here.

3483
03:50:54,319 --> 03:50:56,319
What items could I possibly

3484
03:50:56,319 --> 03:50:57,319
use right now to make this

3485
03:50:57,319 --> 03:50:58,319
easier on me?

3486
03:50:58,319 --> 03:50:59,319
Maybe...

3487
03:50:59,319 --> 03:51:00,319
What about this?

3488
03:51:00,319 --> 03:51:01,319
I'm curious.

3489
03:51:01,319 --> 03:51:06,340
Let's just see something.

3490
03:51:06,340 --> 03:51:09,690
Finger whistle.

3491
03:51:09,690 --> 03:51:10,690
I'm just throwing darts

3492
03:51:10,690 --> 03:51:11,690
here.

3493
03:51:11,690 --> 03:51:21,950
Hold on.

3494
03:51:21,950 --> 03:51:22,950
Oh, come over there.

3495
03:51:22,950 --> 03:51:23,950
Hi.

3496
03:51:23,950 --> 03:51:33,899
You wanted my attention?

3497
03:51:33,899 --> 03:51:34,899
Well, I'm here.

3498
03:51:34,899 --> 03:51:35,899
I poisoned him with this?

3499
03:51:35,899 --> 03:51:36,899
No, I got the wrong thing

3500
03:51:36,899 --> 03:51:40,309
equipped.

3501
03:51:40,309 --> 03:51:47,569
Just kill me.

3502
03:51:47,569 --> 03:51:48,569
Do it again.

3503
03:51:48,569 --> 03:52:06,100
He's weak to the AK.

3504
03:52:06,100 --> 03:52:08,590
I would hope so.

3505
03:52:08,590 --> 03:52:09,590
Defense sugar.

3506
03:52:09,590 --> 03:52:10,590
Yeah, I mean,

3507
03:52:10,590 --> 03:52:11,590
here's the thing though.

3508
03:52:11,590 --> 03:52:12,590
I want to...

3509
03:52:12,590 --> 03:52:13,590
If I use those now,

3510
03:52:13,590 --> 03:52:14,590
I'll just waste them.

3511
03:52:14,590 --> 03:52:15,590
You know, I want to get

3512
03:52:15,590 --> 03:52:16,590
in a position where

3513
03:52:16,590 --> 03:52:22,200
I'm confident in at least

3514
03:52:22,200 --> 03:52:23,200
dodging or blocking or

3515
03:52:23,200 --> 03:52:24,200
moving away from...

3516
03:52:24,200 --> 03:52:25,200
They're already moved.

3517
03:52:25,200 --> 03:52:26,200
Just look right there.

3518
03:52:26,200 --> 03:52:27,200
Like, oh,

3519
03:52:27,200 --> 03:52:28,200
I get the candy.

3520
03:52:28,200 --> 03:52:29,200
It's gone.

3521
03:52:29,200 --> 03:52:30,200
And this guy will use

3522
03:52:30,200 --> 03:52:32,399
them all.

3523
03:52:32,399 --> 03:52:33,399
He'll take every

3524
03:52:33,399 --> 03:52:34,399
single thing from me.

3525
03:52:34,399 --> 03:52:43,770
I guess some of the ones

3526
03:52:43,770 --> 03:52:44,770
that are huge telegraphs

3527
03:52:44,770 --> 03:52:45,770
like this stomp.

3528
03:52:45,770 --> 03:52:46,770
Maybe I'll try to deflect

3529
03:52:46,770 --> 03:52:47,770
it.

3530
03:52:47,770 --> 03:52:53,420
Let me see if it's

3531
03:52:53,420 --> 03:52:54,420
possible.

3532
03:52:54,420 --> 03:52:55,420
Let's see if I can get him

3533
03:52:55,420 --> 03:53:00,309
to do it.

3534
03:53:00,309 --> 03:53:02,510
What?

3535
03:53:02,510 --> 03:53:11,750
He has so much time

3536
03:53:11,750 --> 03:53:12,750
on that move.

3537
03:53:12,750 --> 03:53:13,750
You've got to time that

3538
03:53:13,750 --> 03:53:22,030
move perfectly.

3539
03:53:22,030 --> 03:53:23,030
You're going to get hit

3540
03:53:23,030 --> 03:53:24,030
by it every time.

3541
03:53:24,030 --> 03:53:26,170
Stomp.

3542
03:53:26,170 --> 03:53:27,170
Let me see if it's even

3543
03:53:27,170 --> 03:53:28,170
possible, man.

3544
03:53:28,170 --> 03:53:29,170
Come on.

3545
03:53:29,170 --> 03:53:32,180
Well, he didn't get me.

3546
03:53:32,180 --> 03:53:33,180
Somehow.

3547
03:53:33,180 --> 03:53:39,280
What?

3548
03:53:39,280 --> 03:53:40,280
No.

3549
03:53:40,280 --> 03:53:41,280
Like, really,

3550
03:53:41,280 --> 03:53:42,280
really,

3551
03:53:42,280 --> 03:53:43,280
realistically speaking,

3552
03:53:43,280 --> 03:53:45,280
why did I not dodge that?

3553
03:53:45,280 --> 03:53:46,280
I...

3554
03:53:46,280 --> 03:53:47,280
Realistically speaking,

3555
03:53:47,280 --> 03:53:48,280
let's be real about that.

3556
03:53:48,280 --> 03:53:49,780
I can't jump that?

3557
03:53:49,780 --> 03:53:50,780
Or am I just too close?

3558
03:53:50,780 --> 03:53:51,780
I feel like it's half

3559
03:53:51,780 --> 03:53:52,780
the time that move I can

3560
03:53:52,780 --> 03:53:56,190
get away from.

3561
03:53:56,190 --> 03:53:57,190
That's not, like,

3562
03:53:57,190 --> 03:53:58,190
technically a sweep

3563
03:53:58,190 --> 03:54:11,270
movement.

3564
03:54:11,270 --> 03:54:12,270
Well, I did it.

3565
03:54:12,270 --> 03:54:13,270
I'm not even sure

3566
03:54:13,270 --> 03:54:37,700
what I'm doing here.

3567
03:54:37,700 --> 03:54:38,700
It looked like

3568
03:54:38,700 --> 03:54:39,700
it was doing something.

3569
03:54:39,700 --> 03:54:40,700
Fucking gigantic box.

3570
03:54:40,700 --> 03:54:41,700
Fuck you.

3571
03:54:41,700 --> 03:54:42,700
No, he's jumping!

3572
03:54:42,700 --> 03:54:50,020
Oh!

3573
03:54:50,020 --> 03:54:51,020
Phase one.

3574
03:54:51,020 --> 03:54:52,020
Done.

3575
03:54:52,020 --> 03:54:53,020
Phase two.

3576
03:54:53,020 --> 03:55:17,620
Incoming.

3577
03:55:17,620 --> 03:55:22,000
Attack.

3578
03:55:22,000 --> 03:55:23,000
Oh, now what?

3579
03:55:23,000 --> 03:55:24,000
Now what do I have to do?

3580
03:55:24,000 --> 03:55:28,819
Same?

3581
03:55:28,819 --> 03:55:29,819
More of the same?

3582
03:55:29,819 --> 03:55:36,700
A little more of the same.

3583
03:55:36,700 --> 03:55:37,700
What the fuck happened there?

3584
03:55:37,700 --> 03:55:38,700
You have to stay...

3585
03:55:38,700 --> 03:55:43,780
You've got to just

3586
03:55:43,780 --> 03:55:44,780
run the fucking way

3587
03:55:44,780 --> 03:55:45,780
when you go to that move.

3588
03:55:45,780 --> 03:55:46,780
You just run the fucking way

3589
03:55:46,780 --> 03:55:47,780
when you go to that move.

3590
03:55:47,780 --> 03:55:58,549
You just run the fucking way

3591
03:55:58,549 --> 03:55:59,549
when you go to that move.

3592
03:55:59,549 --> 03:56:04,120
You just run the fucking way

3593
03:56:04,120 --> 03:56:14,510
when you go to that move.

3594
03:56:14,510 --> 03:56:15,510
You just run the fucking way

3595
03:56:15,510 --> 03:56:16,510
when you go to that move.

3596
03:56:16,510 --> 03:56:17,819
You just do.

3597
03:56:17,819 --> 03:56:18,819
There's no way

3598
03:56:18,819 --> 03:56:19,819
you can dodge those.

3599
03:56:19,819 --> 03:56:20,819
Like right now,

3600
03:56:20,819 --> 03:56:22,180
I've got to come out of there.

3601
03:56:22,180 --> 03:56:23,180
Hold on.

3602
03:56:23,180 --> 03:56:26,020
Itchy eye.

3603
03:56:26,020 --> 03:56:27,020
This is not eye...

3604
03:56:27,020 --> 03:56:41,579
Why would I even use that?

3605
03:56:41,579 --> 03:56:42,579
Oh!

3606
03:56:42,579 --> 03:56:44,969
Sorry.

3607
03:56:44,969 --> 03:56:51,069
Uh...

3608
03:56:51,069 --> 03:57:04,280
Um...

3609
03:57:04,280 --> 03:57:05,280
Let's go.

3610
03:57:05,280 --> 03:57:06,280
Let's try it again.

3611
03:57:06,280 --> 03:57:07,280
I don't know.

3612
03:57:07,280 --> 03:57:08,280
My eye, my right eye

3613
03:57:08,280 --> 03:57:10,930
is so irritated right now.

3614
03:57:10,930 --> 03:57:11,930
Why?

3615
03:57:11,930 --> 03:57:12,930
Do you have like

3616
03:57:12,930 --> 03:57:13,930
allergies or something?

3617
03:57:13,930 --> 03:57:14,930
Fuck.

3618
03:57:14,930 --> 03:57:16,870
Just kill me.

3619
03:57:16,870 --> 03:57:17,870
I've got to start over.

3620
03:57:17,870 --> 03:57:18,870
Ugh.

3621
03:57:18,870 --> 03:57:24,979
I've got this like

3622
03:57:24,979 --> 03:57:28,069
extreme eye itchy eye

3623
03:57:28,069 --> 03:57:29,069
irritation.

3624
03:57:29,069 --> 03:57:30,069
Ugh.

3625
03:57:30,069 --> 03:57:31,069
What the fuck

3626
03:57:31,069 --> 03:57:32,069
is happening right now?

3627
03:57:32,069 --> 03:57:33,069
This is like

3628
03:57:33,069 --> 03:57:40,649
unbearable.

3629
03:57:40,649 --> 03:57:41,649
My right eye

3630
03:57:41,649 --> 03:57:42,649
is like going crazy.

3631
03:57:42,649 --> 03:57:43,649
Ugh.

3632
03:57:43,649 --> 03:57:45,270
Ugh.

3633
03:57:45,270 --> 03:57:46,270
This is a problem.

3634
03:57:46,270 --> 03:57:47,270
I'm trying to deflect it.

3635
03:57:47,270 --> 03:57:50,110
It's a mistake.

3636
03:57:50,110 --> 03:57:52,760
Honest to God,

3637
03:57:52,760 --> 03:57:53,760
I just did keep doing

3638
03:57:53,760 --> 03:58:08,440
what I was doing.

3639
03:58:08,440 --> 03:58:09,440
So much to happen.

3640
03:58:09,440 --> 03:58:10,440
I need to at least

3641
03:58:10,440 --> 03:58:11,440
get to like

3642
03:58:11,440 --> 03:58:12,440
the second or third phase.

3643
03:58:12,440 --> 03:58:14,319
Maybe if you...

3644
03:58:14,319 --> 03:58:16,139
I wonder if you deflected

3645
03:58:16,139 --> 03:58:17,139
if you like

3646
03:58:17,139 --> 03:58:18,139
toss them backwards

3647
03:58:18,139 --> 03:58:19,139
or something.

3648
03:58:19,139 --> 03:58:20,889
Going off.

3649
03:58:21,889 --> 03:58:22,889
You get him to do that,

3650
03:58:22,889 --> 03:58:23,889
you get a good

3651
03:58:23,889 --> 03:58:38,120
bunch of hits on him.

3652
03:58:38,120 --> 03:58:43,579
Here he goes.

3653
03:58:43,579 --> 03:58:50,459
He's going up.

3654
03:58:50,459 --> 03:59:00,850
Get me away from

3655
03:59:00,850 --> 03:59:01,850
the wall here, man.

3656
03:59:01,850 --> 03:59:02,850
We've got to get away

3657
03:59:02,850 --> 03:59:09,270
from the wall.

3658
03:59:09,270 --> 03:59:10,270
Away from the wall.

3659
03:59:10,270 --> 03:59:15,100
Away from the...

3660
03:59:15,100 --> 03:59:16,100
Just come over here.

3661
03:59:16,100 --> 03:59:21,500
But if you go too far away,

3662
03:59:21,500 --> 03:59:22,500
he might throw that shit at you.

3663
03:59:22,500 --> 03:59:23,799
You know what I'm saying?

3664
03:59:23,799 --> 03:59:24,799
He might throw

3665
03:59:24,799 --> 03:59:25,799
that shit at you.

3666
03:59:25,799 --> 03:59:27,489
Hey.

3667
03:59:27,489 --> 03:59:28,489
Throw.

3668
03:59:28,489 --> 03:59:29,489
Throw.

3669
03:59:29,489 --> 03:59:30,489
Throw.

3670
03:59:30,489 --> 03:59:31,489
Throw.

3671
03:59:31,489 --> 04:00:03,190
I'm far away.

3672
04:00:03,190 --> 04:00:04,819
Got it.

3673
04:00:04,819 --> 04:00:05,819
Eight.

3674
04:00:05,819 --> 04:00:06,819
Nine.

3675
04:00:06,819 --> 04:00:07,819
Nine.

3676
04:00:07,819 --> 04:00:11,100
Ten.

3677
04:00:11,100 --> 04:00:12,100
Got it.

3678
04:00:12,100 --> 04:00:13,100
Eight boards.

3679
04:00:13,100 --> 04:00:20,100
Let's go.

3680
04:00:20,100 --> 04:00:21,100
He does that

3681
04:00:21,100 --> 04:00:25,420
explosion.

3682
04:00:25,420 --> 04:00:31,950
Get it.

3683
04:00:31,950 --> 04:00:32,950
Wait just a minute.

3684
04:00:32,950 --> 04:00:33,950
Oh.

3685
04:00:33,950 --> 04:00:34,950
He fucking did

3686
04:00:34,950 --> 04:01:00,000
something different.

3687
04:01:00,000 --> 04:01:01,000
Oh.

3688
04:01:01,000 --> 04:01:02,559
That was

3689
04:01:02,559 --> 04:01:03,559
a weird angle.

3690
04:01:03,559 --> 04:01:15,920
Oh.

3691
04:01:15,920 --> 04:01:16,920
I hate that move.

3692
04:01:16,920 --> 04:01:17,920
It's so hard to get

3693
04:01:17,920 --> 04:01:18,920
around.

3694
04:01:18,920 --> 04:01:20,610
Oh.

3695
04:01:20,610 --> 04:01:21,610
It really is.

3696
04:01:21,610 --> 04:01:22,610
Just fucking takes up

3697
04:01:22,610 --> 04:01:23,610
so much real estate.

3698
04:01:23,610 --> 04:01:24,610
He's got more

3699
04:01:24,610 --> 04:01:25,610
moves and shit now.

3700
04:01:25,610 --> 04:01:26,610
This motherfucker

3701
04:01:26,610 --> 04:01:27,610
is adding moves.

3702
04:01:27,610 --> 04:01:46,129
That's new.

3703
04:01:46,129 --> 04:01:47,129
That's...

3704
04:01:47,129 --> 04:01:48,129
Oh my God.

3705
04:01:48,129 --> 04:01:49,129
There's so many

3706
04:01:49,129 --> 04:01:50,129
things to learn.

3707
04:01:50,129 --> 04:01:51,129
What the fuck

3708
04:01:51,129 --> 04:01:52,129
is this?

3709
04:01:52,129 --> 04:01:55,420
Jesus Christ,

3710
04:01:55,420 --> 04:01:56,420
man.

3711
04:01:56,420 --> 04:01:57,420
We got like

3712
04:01:57,420 --> 04:01:58,420
another...

3713
04:01:58,420 --> 04:01:59,420
We got like

3714
04:01:59,420 --> 04:02:00,420
a 25 minute boss fight

3715
04:02:00,420 --> 04:02:01,420
if you do everything right.

3716
04:02:01,420 --> 04:02:02,420
Oh my

3717
04:02:02,420 --> 04:02:07,620
goodness.

3718
04:02:07,620 --> 04:02:08,620
Is this Warcraft?

3719
04:02:08,620 --> 04:02:09,620
Am I playing

3720
04:02:09,620 --> 04:02:10,620
World of Warcraft

3721
04:02:10,620 --> 04:02:11,620
or is this

3722
04:02:11,620 --> 04:02:15,100
an action game?

3723
04:02:15,100 --> 04:02:16,100
Yeah.

3724
04:02:16,100 --> 04:02:17,100
We got him down

3725
04:02:17,100 --> 04:02:18,100
to five percent.

3726
04:02:18,100 --> 04:02:19,100
Yeah.

3727
04:02:19,100 --> 04:02:20,100
Two percent.

3728
04:02:20,100 --> 04:02:21,100
DPS hard.

3729
04:02:21,100 --> 04:02:22,100
Okay.

3730
04:02:22,100 --> 04:02:23,100
Here comes phase two.

3731
04:02:23,100 --> 04:02:24,100
All right.

3732
04:02:24,100 --> 04:02:25,100
This is where...

3733
04:02:25,100 --> 04:02:26,100
The mages

3734
04:02:26,100 --> 04:02:27,100
and the warlocks

3735
04:02:27,100 --> 04:02:28,100
It's been...

3736
04:02:28,100 --> 04:02:29,100
It's been 18 minutes.

3737
04:02:29,100 --> 04:02:30,100
Yup.

3738
04:02:30,100 --> 04:02:31,100
Okay.

3739
04:02:31,100 --> 04:02:32,100
Still fighting.

3740
04:02:32,100 --> 04:03:11,420
One percent.

3741
04:03:11,420 --> 04:03:12,420
Come on.

3742
04:03:12,420 --> 04:03:13,420
You can do it.

3743
04:03:13,420 --> 04:03:27,020
I haven't seen him

3744
04:03:27,020 --> 04:03:28,020
do that.

3745
04:03:28,020 --> 04:03:44,040
I'm already

3746
04:03:44,040 --> 04:03:45,040
not a great start

3747
04:03:45,040 --> 04:03:46,040
but I'll try it.

3748
04:03:46,040 --> 04:03:58,799
Fuck.

3749
04:03:58,799 --> 04:03:59,799
You got too many

3750
04:03:59,799 --> 04:04:04,239
like hairs.

3751
04:04:04,239 --> 04:04:05,239
That was

3752
04:04:05,239 --> 04:04:06,239
an instant kill.

3753
04:04:06,239 --> 04:04:10,940
What?

3754
04:04:10,940 --> 04:04:12,370
In the name of fucking

3755
04:04:12,370 --> 04:04:14,500
God, man.

3756
04:04:14,500 --> 04:04:25,979
Instant kill.

3757
04:04:25,979 --> 04:04:26,979
We got...

3758
04:04:26,979 --> 04:04:27,979
This is optional?

3759
04:04:27,979 --> 04:04:28,979
Well, I've been here

3760
04:04:28,979 --> 04:04:29,979
for long enough.

3761
04:04:29,979 --> 04:04:30,979
I have to do it.

3762
04:04:30,979 --> 04:04:31,979
I know this is probably...

3763
04:04:31,979 --> 04:04:32,979
This is probably

3764
04:04:32,979 --> 04:04:33,979
like this.

3765
04:04:33,979 --> 04:04:34,979
And it's...

3766
04:04:34,979 --> 04:04:35,979
Here it is.

3767
04:04:35,979 --> 04:04:36,979
So, I'm...

3768
04:04:36,979 --> 04:04:37,979
I'm going for it, man.

3769
04:04:37,979 --> 04:04:38,979
I'm already here.

3770
04:04:38,979 --> 04:04:39,979
I got...

3771
04:04:39,979 --> 04:04:40,979
I got him down

3772
04:04:40,979 --> 04:04:41,979
to one bubble.

3773
04:04:41,979 --> 04:05:01,079
I can't just leave.

3774
04:05:01,079 --> 04:05:02,079
Again with this.

3775
04:05:02,079 --> 04:05:13,819
Oh, God damn it.

3776
04:05:13,819 --> 04:05:14,819
Not again.

3777
04:05:14,819 --> 04:05:21,750
Oh, my God.

3778
04:05:21,750 --> 04:05:26,750
It's the bane of my whole existence.

3779
04:05:26,750 --> 04:05:28,750
It is the guaranteed to die

3780
04:05:28,750 --> 04:05:29,750
if it touches you.

3781
04:05:29,750 --> 04:05:32,750
Oh, it's the worst.

3782
04:05:32,750 --> 04:05:34,750
It's the worst.

3783
04:05:34,750 --> 04:05:35,750
It's the worst.

3784
04:05:35,750 --> 04:05:36,750
It's the worst, man.

3785
04:05:36,750 --> 04:05:37,750
It's the worst.

3786
04:05:37,750 --> 04:05:38,750
It's so hard to tell

3787
04:05:38,750 --> 04:05:39,750
when he's going to do it too

3788
04:05:39,750 --> 04:05:46,559
because you got to stay close.

3789
04:05:46,559 --> 04:05:47,559
This motherfucker

3790
04:05:47,559 --> 04:05:48,559
can just pull that

3791
04:05:48,559 --> 04:05:50,440
like a deck of...

3792
04:05:50,440 --> 04:05:51,440
He can just throw it up there

3793
04:05:51,440 --> 04:05:52,440
whenever he wants.

3794
04:05:52,440 --> 04:05:53,440
Let's go.

3795
04:05:53,440 --> 04:05:54,440
I'm doing something.

3796
04:05:54,440 --> 04:06:09,309
Kind of in the ball though.

3797
04:06:09,309 --> 04:06:19,959
At least he hit me a couple of times.

3798
04:06:19,959 --> 04:06:20,959
Balls, right?

3799
04:06:20,959 --> 04:06:21,959
I'm getting the fuck out of here

3800
04:06:21,959 --> 04:06:30,690
when he does this shit, man.

3801
04:06:30,690 --> 04:06:31,690
I honestly cannot believe

3802
04:06:31,690 --> 04:06:36,700
that the stomp hit me.

3803
04:06:36,700 --> 04:06:37,700
This guy is an earth-sized hitbox.

3804
04:06:37,700 --> 04:06:43,170
He...

3805
04:06:43,170 --> 04:06:44,170
He...

3806
04:06:44,170 --> 04:06:45,170
She's so...

3807
04:06:45,170 --> 04:06:48,069
She's so...

3808
04:06:48,069 --> 04:06:49,069
She's so...

3809
04:06:49,069 --> 04:06:50,069
She's so...

3810
04:06:50,069 --> 04:06:52,079
She's so...

3811
04:06:52,079 --> 04:06:53,079
She's so...

3812
04:06:53,079 --> 04:06:54,079
She's so...

3813
04:07:09,850 --> 04:07:10,850
He...

3814
04:07:10,850 --> 04:07:11,850
She stands there

3815
04:07:11,850 --> 04:07:13,340
and he's got

3816
04:07:13,340 --> 04:07:14,340
a hitbox the size

3817
04:07:14,340 --> 04:07:15,340
of a goddamn Jupiter

3818
04:07:15,340 --> 04:07:21,190
around him.

3819
04:07:21,190 --> 04:07:22,190
Holy shit.

3820
04:07:22,190 --> 04:07:35,129
Well,

3821
04:07:35,129 --> 04:07:36,129
do I have anything

3822
04:07:36,129 --> 04:07:39,219
I can do here?

3823
04:07:39,219 --> 04:07:40,219
Is this guy dead?

3824
04:07:40,219 --> 04:07:45,370
Wait, now...

3825
04:07:45,370 --> 04:07:46,370
Why can't I do this?

3826
04:07:46,370 --> 04:07:49,629
I should know how to do this.

3827
04:07:49,629 --> 04:08:00,940
I don't think I have anything, guys.

3828
04:08:00,940 --> 04:08:02,940
Prevents damage from fire attacks,

3829
04:08:02,940 --> 04:08:03,940
but man, I got to go...

3830
04:08:03,940 --> 04:08:04,940
I can't get that right now.

3831
04:08:04,940 --> 04:08:08,530
I got to go from all the way up here

3832
04:08:08,530 --> 04:08:12,899
to get this.

3833
04:08:12,899 --> 04:08:28,709
Let's see what I can do for skills.

3834
04:08:28,709 --> 04:08:34,340
That guy is fucking crazy.

3835
04:08:34,340 --> 04:08:38,979
Well, there had to be one, right?

3836
04:08:38,979 --> 04:08:39,979
Or two?

3837
04:08:39,979 --> 04:08:43,579
Um...

3838
04:08:43,579 --> 04:08:44,579
No, no, no.

3839
04:08:44,579 --> 04:08:48,450
Skills, skills, skills.

3840
04:08:48,450 --> 04:08:50,620
I got six points.

3841
04:08:50,620 --> 04:08:51,620
What am I...

3842
04:08:51,620 --> 04:08:57,469
What do I need here?

3843
04:08:57,469 --> 04:08:58,469
Uh...

3844
04:08:58,469 --> 04:09:00,840
This is less sound.

3845
04:09:00,840 --> 04:09:04,860
It's just more...

3846
04:09:04,860 --> 04:09:16,250
Spirit emblems.

3847
04:09:16,250 --> 04:09:25,620
Fang and blade.

3848
04:09:25,620 --> 04:09:27,620
Midair prosthetic tool.

3849
04:09:27,620 --> 04:09:41,950
I'm not sure what the hell I should buy.

3850
04:09:41,950 --> 04:09:55,010
Well, I'm going to do this.

3851
04:09:55,010 --> 04:10:03,780
Because that will...

3852
04:10:03,780 --> 04:10:04,780
That seems good.

3853
04:10:04,780 --> 04:10:08,659
Forward dash.

3854
04:10:08,659 --> 04:10:09,659
After you use prosthetic,

3855
04:10:09,659 --> 04:10:10,659
you can get close.

3856
04:10:10,659 --> 04:10:13,889
Then these.

3857
04:10:13,889 --> 04:10:14,889
Midair prosthetic.

3858
04:10:14,889 --> 04:10:18,540
Tools while in midair.

3859
04:10:18,540 --> 04:10:25,639
That sounds kind of good, actually.

3860
04:10:25,639 --> 04:10:37,180
What was the other one?

3861
04:10:37,180 --> 04:10:38,870
It was like another...

3862
04:10:38,870 --> 04:10:39,870
It was deflection, right?

3863
04:10:39,870 --> 04:10:40,870
Yeah.

3864
04:10:40,870 --> 04:10:41,870
This one.

3865
04:10:41,870 --> 04:10:47,459
You can deflect in the air.

3866
04:10:47,459 --> 04:10:48,459
That's a huge deal.

3867
04:10:48,459 --> 04:10:50,459
I don't know how the hell I didn't have this.

3868
04:10:50,459 --> 04:10:56,610
And leads to...

3869
04:10:56,610 --> 04:10:59,549
Combat arts while in the air.

3870
04:10:59,549 --> 04:11:01,559
Uh...

3871
04:11:01,559 --> 04:11:04,020
This is kind of good.

3872
04:11:04,020 --> 04:11:10,100
I'm going to hold on to the points, though.

3873
04:11:10,100 --> 04:11:12,459
Because I don't think there's anything else

3874
04:11:12,459 --> 04:11:13,459
I really want here.

3875
04:11:13,459 --> 04:11:24,920
HR slash.

3876
04:11:24,920 --> 04:11:27,719
Living force.

3877
04:11:27,719 --> 04:11:28,719
Shadow rush.

3878
04:11:28,719 --> 04:11:32,239
Unleash a long-range powerful thrust

3879
04:11:32,239 --> 04:11:34,239
and use the impaled opponent as a platform

3880
04:11:34,239 --> 04:11:36,239
to vault into the sky.

3881
04:11:36,239 --> 04:11:48,149
Hmm.

3882
04:11:48,149 --> 04:11:49,149
I don't know.

3883
04:11:49,149 --> 04:11:50,149
I'm not sure.

3884
04:11:50,149 --> 04:11:58,600
I mean, I have to spend them somewhere.

3885
04:11:58,600 --> 04:12:09,540
Attack with the sword and tool simultaneously.

3886
04:12:09,540 --> 04:12:10,540
That's pretty good.

3887
04:12:10,540 --> 04:12:13,129
Midair tool.

3888
04:12:13,129 --> 04:12:14,129
Eh.

3889
04:12:14,129 --> 04:12:22,979
I like this.

3890
04:12:22,979 --> 04:12:31,559
Let me take a look at it.

3891
04:12:31,559 --> 04:12:34,700
Special sword attacks can be performed

3892
04:12:34,700 --> 04:12:36,700
immediately after using prosthetic.

3893
04:12:36,700 --> 04:12:38,700
I can trigger it right afterward to a follow-up attack.

3894
04:12:38,700 --> 04:12:41,700
Actually, I use the firecracker so often.

3895
04:12:41,700 --> 04:12:49,700
What do we got here?

3896
04:12:49,700 --> 04:12:51,379
Floating passage.

3897
04:12:51,379 --> 04:12:52,379
I like it.

3898
04:12:52,379 --> 04:12:55,389
I just took it off.

3899
04:12:55,389 --> 04:13:03,159
Jerma lied about Minecraft VR.

3900
04:13:03,159 --> 04:13:05,159
Thanks for the five community subs.

3901
04:13:05,159 --> 04:13:07,870
Thank you.

3902
04:13:07,870 --> 04:13:09,430
Welcome back.

3903
04:13:09,430 --> 04:13:11,440
All right.

3904
04:13:11,440 --> 04:13:12,440
Where's the...

3905
04:13:12,440 --> 04:13:13,440
Where the hell is the blacksmith?

3906
04:13:13,440 --> 04:13:18,139
I don't have any money.

3907
04:13:18,139 --> 04:13:20,139
I died like ten times.

3908
04:13:20,139 --> 04:13:28,020
But thank you so much, Jerma lied about Minecraft VR.

3909
04:13:28,020 --> 04:13:34,040
Talk to Kuro again.

3910
04:13:34,040 --> 04:13:38,389
Try to talk with the immortal training dude.

3911
04:13:38,389 --> 04:13:51,729
He's dead.

3912
04:13:51,729 --> 04:13:54,030
Secret passage.

3913
04:13:56,030 --> 04:13:57,030
Yeah.

3914
04:14:03,420 --> 04:14:04,420
Give Gord seed.

3915
04:14:04,420 --> 04:14:05,420
Why would I...

3916
04:14:05,420 --> 04:14:06,420
Oh.

3917
04:14:06,420 --> 04:14:07,420
Flug Boy.

3918
04:14:07,420 --> 04:14:08,420
Five community subs in Flug Boy.

3919
04:14:08,420 --> 04:14:11,430
Thank you so much, Flug Boy.

3920
04:14:19,100 --> 04:14:22,489
Single-minded search for strength entered

3921
04:14:22,489 --> 04:14:23,489
and taking the machine for his own.

3922
04:14:23,489 --> 04:14:26,489
This is the result of combining techniques from the styles he encountered.

3923
04:14:32,670 --> 04:14:33,909
Lord Isshin.

3924
04:14:33,909 --> 04:14:39,049
If Sekiro is able to master these, I'd like to duel him.

3925
04:14:39,049 --> 04:14:40,049
Oh, he's dead.

3926
04:14:40,049 --> 04:14:42,309
Please.

3927
04:14:42,309 --> 04:14:47,799
I'll give him this book.

3928
04:14:47,799 --> 04:14:48,799
Wait, so did I...

3929
04:14:48,799 --> 04:14:54,370
He died before we could fight.

3930
04:14:54,370 --> 04:14:59,360
I still haven't beaten Lord Genichiro.

3931
04:14:59,360 --> 04:15:01,360
I just want you to know there are bite marks in my controller

3932
04:15:01,360 --> 04:15:03,360
and I hope you're having a good night.

3933
04:15:03,360 --> 04:15:05,360
This game's rough, man.

3934
04:15:05,360 --> 04:15:08,750
It really is.

3935
04:15:08,750 --> 04:15:11,180
It's a lot of fun, but it is fucking brutal.

3936
04:15:11,180 --> 04:15:13,180
It is super sharp.

3937
04:15:13,180 --> 04:15:17,510
It's like eating the most delicious thing you've ever thought of.

3938
04:15:17,510 --> 04:15:20,510
Think of the most delicious hamburger you could ever eat.

3939
04:15:20,510 --> 04:15:21,510
Oh, my God.

3940
04:15:21,510 --> 04:15:22,510
I love it.

3941
04:15:22,510 --> 04:15:23,510
It's a perfect flavor.

3942
04:15:23,510 --> 04:15:25,510
But the burger's made out of glass.

3943
04:15:25,510 --> 04:15:29,799
That's kind of how this is.

3944
04:15:40,549 --> 04:15:42,620
Jesus.

3945
04:15:42,620 --> 04:15:46,079
Empowered mortal draw.

3946
04:15:46,079 --> 04:15:47,079
How do I even get these?

3947
04:15:47,079 --> 04:15:48,079
Not available.

3948
04:15:48,079 --> 04:15:51,860
Five skill points.

3949
04:15:51,860 --> 04:16:02,329
One can draw, riddling a longer range, more powerful slash attack.

3950
04:16:02,329 --> 04:16:05,329
Draw the sword that cannot be drawn and unleash its devastation.

3951
04:16:05,329 --> 04:16:06,329
Ooh.

3952
04:16:07,569 --> 04:16:12,520
All right.

3953
04:16:12,520 --> 04:16:15,340
Well, I'm not sure.

3954
04:16:15,340 --> 04:16:16,340
I'm not sure what to do.

3955
04:16:16,340 --> 04:16:19,340
Should I keep smashing my head against the wall and try to beat this boss?

3956
04:16:19,340 --> 04:16:22,340
Or should I continue to progress the story in the game?

3957
04:16:22,340 --> 04:16:38,399
Yeah, there was a...

3958
04:16:38,399 --> 04:16:39,399
You know what?

3959
04:16:39,399 --> 04:16:40,399
Here's what we're going to do.

3960
04:16:40,399 --> 04:16:43,780
For the sake of...

3961
04:16:43,780 --> 04:16:47,340
I went by like a few different...

3962
04:16:47,340 --> 04:16:54,420
There's at least two mini bosses that I know that I can fight.

3963
04:16:54,420 --> 04:16:57,620
There's at least a few.

3964
04:16:57,620 --> 04:16:59,620
There's the drunk guy that was out...

3965
04:16:59,620 --> 04:17:01,620
There's like two drunk guys.

3966
04:17:01,620 --> 04:17:03,239
Go kill headless...

3967
04:17:03,239 --> 04:17:04,239
No.

3968
04:17:04,239 --> 04:17:05,420
No.

3969
04:17:05,420 --> 04:17:06,420
No, I can't.

3970
04:17:06,420 --> 04:17:07,420
I can't.

3971
04:17:07,420 --> 04:17:13,620
I can't do it.

3972
04:17:13,620 --> 04:17:14,930
I can't.

3973
04:17:14,930 --> 04:17:15,930
I don't remember where it is.

3974
04:17:15,930 --> 04:17:21,709
So I can't do it.

3975
04:17:21,709 --> 04:17:22,709
It's like here, right?

3976
04:17:22,709 --> 04:17:28,540
Oh, I can't do it.

3977
04:17:28,540 --> 04:17:29,540
Was it hidden forest?

3978
04:17:29,540 --> 04:17:31,860
All right.

3979
04:17:31,860 --> 04:17:33,860
No, this is going to make me so mad.

3980
04:17:33,860 --> 04:17:36,860
Do you see how many times I died at that boss?

3981
04:17:36,860 --> 04:17:40,059
Those of you that were here last night.

3982
04:17:40,059 --> 04:17:43,299
I died like three or four times to this guy.

3983
04:17:43,299 --> 04:17:46,299
And it drove me fucking mental.

3984
04:17:46,299 --> 04:17:47,299
I was so angry.

3985
04:17:47,299 --> 04:17:52,299
I just died like 10 to 15 times to that giant flaming monster.

3986
04:17:52,299 --> 04:17:54,299
And I'm like still fine learning.

3987
04:17:54,299 --> 04:17:55,299
Oh, this is crazy.

3988
04:17:55,299 --> 04:17:56,299
Wow.

3989
04:17:56,299 --> 04:17:57,610
What a move.

3990
04:17:57,610 --> 04:18:02,430
This is going to ruin the stream.

3991
04:18:02,430 --> 04:18:03,430
This is going to ruin the stream.

3992
04:18:03,430 --> 04:18:04,430
And I know it.

3993
04:18:04,430 --> 04:18:05,430
Okay.

3994
04:18:05,430 --> 04:18:07,430
I'm going to preemptively make sure that it doesn't ruin the stream.

3995
04:18:07,430 --> 04:18:11,079
You hear me talking right now?

3996
04:18:11,079 --> 04:18:14,079
I'm going to make sure that I'm preemptively making sure this is not going to ruin the stream.

3997
04:18:14,079 --> 04:18:17,219
I'm going to be positive about this.

3998
04:18:17,219 --> 04:18:19,930
I'm just going down.

3999
04:18:19,930 --> 04:18:21,229
I'm going to fight him.

4000
04:18:21,229 --> 04:18:22,229
Fuck items.

4001
04:18:22,229 --> 04:18:23,229
We're just going to fight him.

4002
04:18:23,229 --> 04:18:24,229
All right.

4003
04:18:24,229 --> 04:18:25,229
I'm ready.

4004
04:18:25,229 --> 04:18:26,600
I'm not going to get angry with this guy.

4005
04:18:53,739 --> 04:19:04,149
Wait, wait, wait.

4006
04:19:04,149 --> 04:19:08,780
Where is it?

4007
04:19:08,780 --> 04:19:09,780
I have it.

4008
04:19:09,780 --> 04:19:10,780
It's right here.

4009
04:19:10,780 --> 04:19:13,239
I have five of these.

4010
04:19:13,239 --> 04:19:14,239
No, I can't do this yet.

4011
04:19:14,239 --> 04:19:32,010
No, no, I have to do this before I walk in the door.

4012
04:19:32,010 --> 04:19:44,020
No, he's so awkward.

4013
04:19:44,020 --> 04:19:55,579
I hate this fucking game.

4014
04:19:55,579 --> 04:19:57,579

4076
04:35:41,069 --> 04:35:46,069
so you can't come in here unless you have terrible I need something to block

4077
04:35:46,069 --> 04:35:50,270
the terror otherwise this is just a no-go

4078
04:35:51,270 --> 04:36:22,110
I thought he swings again as long as you keep moving it's really not that

4079
04:36:22,110 --> 04:36:27,750
big of a deal but I could use some of those pacifying agents

4080
04:36:27,750 --> 04:36:57,419
yeah the big ones that turned midway through hitting that ball curved in

4081
04:36:57,419 --> 04:37:11,700
the air twice take a while but

4082
04:37:11,700 --> 04:37:19,060
well I know what he does I was scared last time I was here if I come here

4083
04:37:19,060 --> 04:37:49,040
prepared watch out watch out let's go I don't want to use a confetti not

4084
04:37:49,080 --> 04:37:53,759
yet I could just use it and get screwed

4085
04:37:57,549 --> 04:38:26,909
nice relaxing but whoa big one let's get the items that's a scrap metal

4086
04:38:26,909 --> 04:38:36,779

4087
04:38:36,779 --> 04:38:42,939
uh confetti I'm feeling I'm feeling confident right now let's go I got

4088
04:38:42,939 --> 04:39:06,840
confidence right now bingo let's do it just one where you go cross the way

4089
04:39:06,840 --> 04:39:22,360
this is I need a place to save myself here

4090
04:39:26,360 --> 04:39:35,689
that was a mistake it was a huge mistake I just came in here completely

4091
04:39:35,689 --> 04:39:38,849
unprepared and thought I could kill him somehow but he moved I for some

4092
04:39:38,849 --> 04:39:41,330
reason I didn't think he was gonna move and I had that like little

4093
04:39:41,330 --> 04:39:46,520
cheese strat no all right well I'm not gonna do it again until I have

4094
04:39:46,840 --> 04:40:00,060
some pacifying things or something to stop that the umbrella upgrade I don't

4095
04:40:00,060 --> 04:40:08,569
have I don't think I have the umbrella upgrade confetti will kill him in like

4096
04:40:08,569 --> 04:40:12,090
six hits yeah but the problem is just if I get touched by anything it just

4097
04:40:12,090 --> 04:40:16,369
instantly died that terror just get dead I'd rather have at least the

4098
04:40:16,369 --> 04:40:29,900

4120
04:45:17,750 --> 04:45:23,419
another one of these guys to who dagger with a stark white blade and

4121
04:45:23,419 --> 04:45:29,439
hill to converts vitality into spirit emblems originally this time to was

4122
04:45:29,439 --> 04:45:32,080
used in a ritual offering at the dragon in which an emblem will be cut from

4123
04:45:32,080 --> 04:45:42,020
one's own life force okay so that's that's the self-harm for pellets in

4124
04:45:42,020 --> 04:45:57,939
bloodborne okay so the other one is down in I really would rather have

4125
04:45:57,939 --> 04:46:06,770
prayer beads to be honest yeah well I got another confetti and I have

4126
04:46:06,770 --> 04:46:20,000
another I have plenty of gourds so what does the other one drop let's go

4127
04:46:20,000 --> 04:46:26,209
kill the other one he's like right here right what's a good place to go

4128
04:46:26,209 --> 04:46:54,060
over here because it's another one of these guys back this way okay he's

4129
04:46:54,060 --> 04:47:04,500
under here

4130
04:47:04,740 --> 04:47:09,580

4131
04:47:09,580 --> 04:47:44,380

4133
04:47:58,840 --> 04:48:04,349

4134
04:48:04,349 --> 04:48:10,580
chasing me no all right so here we go should be able to get one or taken

4135
04:48:10,580 --> 04:49:03,479

4140
04:49:59,009 --> 04:50:03,130
to be irritating there's no other reason it's just there to be annoying

4141

4219
05:09:53,779 --> 05:10:43,520
the wall there god damn it it wasn't over I thought it was three this game

4220
05:10:43,520 --> 05:10:48,680
is gonna make me fucking lose my mind I thought it was three swings this

4221
05:10:48,680 --> 05:11:16,430
game's gonna fuck me up this game's gonna fuck me up an optional area

4222
05:11:16,430 --> 05:11:33,349
optional where's that I know I have no I'm so fucked up right now this

4223
05:11:33,349 --> 05:11:50,479
is fucking killing me where is it I don't even know where it is which is

4224
05:11:50,479 --> 05:12:09,060
this one no that's the demon stairway I think it's stairway I beat this guy in

4225
05:12:09,060 --> 05:12:14,229
one swing I'm fucking happy you did I really hope that's true because yeah

4226
05:12:14,229 --> 05:12:24,439
that's I bet that's good I hope you did for real okay so if I go from here

4227
05:12:24,439 --> 05:12:40,840
to backwards from there I think there's too many I wonder and I get

4228
05:12:40,840 --> 05:12:50,610
over here without having a problem here but no way everyone's gonna get

4229
05:12:50,610 --> 05:12:59,529
pulled here unless I maybe if I kill those guys first I don't know that's

4230
05:12:59,529 --> 05:13:10,409
tricky across the game I mean it's possible maybe to pull just him if I

4231
05:13:10,409 --> 05:13:13,130
cleared these guys first which I mean it's like four people though it's not

4232
05:13:13,130 --> 05:13:29,740
different it's actually maybe these guys have cannons and shit too

4233
05:13:29,740 --> 05:13:56,200
let me read this to patrol where the guy where's the okay he's up here you

4234
05:13:56,200 --> 05:14:10,919
have to die right he's gonna shoot arrows that leaves I took a flame

4235
05:14:10,919 --> 05:14:14,880
barrel memo when we broke into Hirata state we found a barrel that spewed

4236
05:14:14,880 --> 05:14:23,560
flame must have been a shinobi's tool the boys lit of rowing bonfire with the

4237
05:14:23,560 --> 05:14:29,709
made merry with the drink must have been a tool they don't already have this

4238
05:14:29,709 --> 05:14:38,759
tool that he's speaking of okay where this buildings on fucking fire I didn't

down here for ash and a pellet all right so this should be another two

4241
05:15:03,869 --> 05:15:06,990

4314

4400
06:01:47,490 --> 06:01:50,729
in my panic I feel like I've been panicking through the whole game

4401
06:01:51,009 --> 06:01:55,590
anybody else feel like that when they play this feel like every single thing

4402
06:01:55,590 --> 06:02:12,759
is panicking every single opportunity what is this monkey booze more money

4403
06:02:12,759 --> 06:02:36,279
good I open this door I guess I can unlock this monkey crack oh dear

4404
06:02:36,279 --> 06:02:41,889
you're actually really not that big of a deal I got a little scared for no

4405
06:02:41,889 --> 06:02:54,680
reason I found it I found it that's what they're talking about the whole game I

4406
06:02:54,680 --> 06:02:57,919
found it there it is this the thing that I can walk through I can go

4407
06:02:57,919 --> 06:03:03,830
through that door that's the painted door thing I can go through there

4408
06:03:03,830 --> 06:03:07,950
remember he was talking about it go through the door that has the thing on

4409
06:03:07,950 --> 06:03:33,479
it Shinobi escape route leads to demon

4410
06:03:33,479 --> 06:04:01,459
Bell I don't I feel like I don't want to I didn't even see it was up

4411
06:04:01,459 --> 06:04:22,009
here all right deep I got a guy didn't get this what the hell does this do

4412
06:04:22,009 --> 06:04:29,840
this is very ominous read do not ring this Bell inviting misfortune is an

4413
06:04:29,840 --> 06:04:32,919
act of virtue but only the stoutest of heart should ever consider it don't

4414
06:04:32,919 --> 06:04:52,720
ring the Bell do not ring this Bell what is it is it a boss this I'm

4415
06:04:52,720 --> 06:05:13,520
gonna spawn something sinister burden what the fuck is this a demonic

4416
06:05:13,520 --> 06:05:17,279
spirit sealed within the iron Bell of simple temple possesses those who ring

4417
06:05:17,279 --> 06:05:23,119
the Bell strengthening enemies around them the Bell demon confers hardship

4418
06:05:23,119 --> 06:05:26,400
but perhaps also slightly better spoils using this item is no particular effect

4419
06:05:26,400 --> 06:05:34,069
the second causing the demon to leave wait this is this is this everything's

4420
06:05:34,069 --> 06:05:43,880
just harder what wait a minute strengthening enemies around them gives

4421
06:05:43,880 --> 06:05:57,610
so you make the game harder but there's a hard mode for secure holy

4422
06:05:57,610 --> 06:06:03,610
shit why would you ever want to have this on how would you want to make this

4423
06:06:03,610 --> 06:06:17,759

4589
06:49:10,080 --> 06:49:13,909

4601
06:52:17,389 --> 06:52:55,139
one bar I hope that was a terrible place to drink and I know it goes

4602
06:52:55,139 --> 06:53:13,279
keep doing the wave your hair move grab that's the easiest thing to

4603
06:53:13,319 --> 06:53:15,319
dodge

4604
06:53:15,560 --> 06:53:39,400
greedy okay that was so much easier than the other ones no fog wall with no

4605
06:53:39,400 --> 06:53:52,650
dodging consume okay this is just another one of these reduces vitality

4606
06:53:52,650 --> 06:53:55,209
damage taken from physical attacks consume spirit of those to use

4607
06:53:55,209 --> 06:54:03,080
repeatedly so these are just candies that I can use whenever I want but

4608
06:54:03,080 --> 06:54:09,240
that's not really what I'm looking for I wanted beads I've killed like

4609
06:54:09,279 --> 06:54:13,880
okay since the demon I've killed like four or five mini bosses and I'm only

4610
06:54:13,880 --> 06:54:26,509
got one beat nothing else down here did I beat the red demon no I stopped

4611
06:54:26,509 --> 06:54:32,349
fighting against the red demon and I started doing other content to take a

4612
06:54:32,349 --> 06:54:41,560
break from it I was hopefully going to get some more stats but doesn't

4613
06:54:41,560 --> 06:54:51,659
seem like that's the case at the moment I got you got the jump on you

4614
06:54:52,220 --> 06:55:33,099
yet the elbow drop all right opportunity comes knocking no I couldn't get a

4615
06:55:33,099 --> 06:55:39,189
stealth been a while since I fought you what the hell you got like grabs and

4616
06:55:39,189 --> 06:55:52,459
shit right I remember this guy you don't pair you just kind of dance

4617
06:55:52,459 --> 06:56:00,639
around it goes over these grabs take the item that's not good he lost the

4618
06:56:00,639 --> 06:56:27,819

4623
06:57:17,520 --> 06:57:21,279
kind of the nail in the coffin for me I think no it's not let me kill that

4658
07:09:17,900 --> 07:09:35,009
let me change this one three of these although what about some of these

4659
07:09:35,009 --> 07:09:51,290
things this is now this is stealth this is vitality damage I might be

4660
07:09:51,290 --> 07:10:00,909
worth using these if they take spirits but all my tools are although

4661
07:10:00,909 --> 07:10:07,900
what my finger whistle didn't I get something I got like a new thing for

4662
07:10:07,900 --> 07:10:20,500
the didn't I get a finger whistle upgrade or something what was it wasn't

4663
07:10:20,500 --> 07:10:32,580
it like oh do this to a beast and always a ring okay is it one of those

4664
07:10:32,580 --> 07:10:54,849
scenarios where I have to upgrade it let's do this first that's a lot more

4665
07:10:54,849 --> 07:11:13,380
health and vitality okay great this is five not available why oh I need

4666
07:11:13,380 --> 07:11:39,900
this to let me go let me go to look at the upgrade screen how am I doing I'm

4667
07:11:39,900 --> 07:11:58,099
doing good hope you're doing good how are you yeah okay so you actually have

4668
07:11:58,099 --> 07:12:11,790
to upgrade it through the tree shit I mean I can get it I can actually get

4669
07:12:11,790 --> 07:12:26,979
this it's gonna cost some money buy three of these thousand bucks and

4670
07:12:27,020 --> 07:12:35,970
then I can do it can be used to drive beasts mad into torment apparition type

4671
07:12:35,970 --> 07:12:44,500
enemies I wonder how much that is for materials though if that's but that

4672
07:12:44,500 --> 07:12:51,000
doesn't seem like that much I can still do this I'm gonna go for it so

4673
07:12:51,000 --> 07:12:57,080
it's six hundred sixteen hundred twenty seven three that's a lot of

4674
07:12:57,080 --> 07:13:10,599
money do I have that money what do I have for money right now two thousand

4675
07:13:11,040 --> 07:13:22,279
I got the money hmm I got the money let's do it how much do I need exactly I

4676
07:13:22,279 --> 07:13:37,259
need 18 let's see let's do the actual math here so I need this and then

4677
07:13:37,259 --> 07:13:52,900
this what does this do so this actually I could have used this an hour ago so

4678
07:13:52,900 --> 07:13:59,080
I need to buy three gunpowders which you should have them over here

4679
07:13:59,080 --> 07:14:07,599
protects from terror that would have been great

4680
07:14:15,599 --> 07:14:24,540
no not a state don't go anywhere I need you here to sell me things so it was I

4681
07:14:24,540 --> 07:14:36,360
know it's iron so I needed three of these please notice me hey how are you

4682
07:14:36,560 --> 07:14:56,380
so that's three 450 I think I should still have enough money panic okay I

4683
07:14:56,380 --> 07:15:06,299
need another 200 bucks you're killing me here you're killing me whatever I

4684
07:15:06,299 --> 07:15:19,849
need to do this anyways we go now I need $1,200

4685
07:15:19,849 --> 07:15:38,659
twelve hundred so that's a thousand five ten fifteen I'm just gonna have to sell

4686
07:15:38,659 --> 07:15:52,490
some shit because I can do no I don't need to it's gonna ease into the pack

4687
07:15:52,490 --> 07:16:04,639
whatever else I'll buy something else too here it is I hope this is worth it

4688
07:16:04,639 --> 07:16:11,939
drive beast mad into torment apparition type enemies I hope this

4689
07:16:11,939 --> 07:16:17,810
horse doing this is a lot of money and there's a lot of resources it's

4690
07:16:17,810 --> 07:16:47,159
done malcontent mal-cun-tent so if it was worth it I wonder how it works

4691
07:16:47,159 --> 07:17:00,459
and how much I got some money let's go back here I'm gonna buy I'm just gonna

4692
07:17:00,459 --> 07:17:04,900
buy like I'm gonna buy one of these just in case for some reason this guy

4693
07:17:04,900 --> 07:17:08,659
goes away what else do I have antidote powder five I got plenty

4694
07:17:08,659 --> 07:17:16,779
antidote pacify let's get another one of these in fact I think yeah I'm you

4695
07:17:16,779 --> 07:17:19,259
know just because I'm just gonna do it I you might think I'm fucking

4696
07:17:20,259 --> 07:17:35,220
you mean you think he's crazy but I I want like more of these I know I have

4697
07:17:35,220 --> 07:17:46,540
the potion but I still I think they're so useful now it's time for an attempt

4698
07:17:46,540 --> 07:17:55,099
let me look at the upgrade screen one more time I want this I can do this I

4699
07:17:55,099 --> 07:17:59,659
just need 1,500 and I need one more of those salt packets it's my

4700
07:17:59,659 --> 07:18:08,319
favorite item in the game over here is this is the fire attack one but I can't

4701
07:18:08,319 --> 07:18:15,709
even get this even if I wanted to I'm apparently missing a prosthetic tool

4702
07:18:15,709 --> 07:18:20,470
which I would have to go one two three four five and then it unlocks

4703
07:18:20,470 --> 07:18:31,939
this so I can't get this we're gonna have to go for it with what I got I

4704
07:18:31,939 --> 07:18:37,939
don't have that tool I don't know what it is I don't know where it is

4705
07:18:37,939 --> 07:18:43,740
let's see what I like I'm gonna scream it's not gonna be that much longer I'm

4706
07:18:43,740 --> 07:18:55,189
just gonna try we'll go again tomorrow try to clean it up finish it all up so

4707
07:18:55,189 --> 07:19:17,599
it was what was it flames of hatred let's see I'm I there was a list was

4708
07:19:17,599 --> 07:19:24,759
a lot of money I want to see what this does demon of hatred what does it

4709
07:19:24,759 --> 07:19:40,299
do pretty useful pretty useful how often can I do that I wonder if it's

4710
07:19:40,299 --> 07:19:56,459
gonna cool down what's the how far away I can do from pretty far away and it's

4711
07:19:56,459 --> 07:20:16,819
alright it's not bad can I do it again immediately can okay so just want to

4712
07:20:16,819 --> 07:20:37,979
see what did wasting spirit emblems I got plenty of spirit I've been

4713
07:20:37,979 --> 07:20:41,860
collecting them the whole game haven't I all right here we go let's go

4714
07:20:41,900 --> 07:20:56,750
oh thanks unseen aid then go oh it's just random shit here guys we're just going through some weird shit

4715
07:20:56,750 --> 07:21:37,049
thought I blocked it ah shit a little rusty a little rusty

4716
07:21:37,049 --> 07:21:58,799
going uphill though I don't like this

4717
07:21:58,799 --> 07:22:51,549
just gonna back it up, back it up, throw him, touch out, it's a cocky pun

4718
07:23:11,099 --> 07:23:25,900
that was close man god damn it fucking hell come on it's that one move that

4719
07:23:25,900 --> 07:23:42,020
sucks it just does that move sucks that's an undeniably fucking shit

4720
07:23:42,020 --> 07:24:15,099
should have waited

4721
07:24:15,500 --> 07:24:41,930
you got next level man on phase two he doesn't throw the balls anymore he

4722
07:24:41,930 --> 07:25:20,830
does that weird I don't know how to get the first two I got to get the first

4723
07:25:20,830 --> 07:25:40,290
phase down a long way to go like it's like that move is it just lingers for

4724
07:25:40,290 --> 07:25:46,619
the hitbox lingers for so long even when he's even if you dodge it so if

4725
07:25:46,619 --> 07:25:51,740
you dodge it even with i-frames for like a tenth of a second two tenths

4726
07:25:51,740 --> 07:26:02,630
of a second after it hits you it's almost like you should maybe even just run to

4727
07:26:02,630 --> 07:26:08,060
his right I don't think that movie I don't think you can dodge parry I don't

4728
07:26:08,060 --> 07:26:10,459
think you have to just get away from that move it's so hard to determine

4729
07:26:10,459 --> 07:26:14,419
what's gonna happen because it takes a not even a second to do it he's

4730
07:26:14,419 --> 07:26:20,049
just like yeah so you can be just you brain decides in a second and you

4731
07:26:20,049 --> 07:26:40,659
have to dodge it just because it happens so quickly there it is again

4732
07:26:40,659 --> 07:26:55,209
see what I mean it's just so quickly it's hard to react to and that was

4733
07:26:55,209 --> 07:28:35,349
with the fire resistance fuck I don't like it there it is all right no he

4734
07:28:35,349 --> 07:28:56,169
doesn't both ways I don't know man you gotta run left it I can you know I feel

4735
07:28:56,169 --> 07:29:22,119
like I don't I'm not sure I can the jump it might be a jump over that there

4736
07:29:22,119 --> 07:29:28,169
might be dead I just barely got to heal up

4737
07:29:30,029 --> 07:29:56,900
unforgiving I can't I can't stop for a second fucker there it is again the

4738
07:29:56,900 --> 07:30:05,630
unfucking bearable move that is one of the only things I take damage to I'm

4739
07:30:05,630 --> 07:30:12,930
thinking I dodged backwards I'm gonna try dodging back to see if doesn't

4740
07:30:12,930 --> 07:30:29,450
it I guess you can jump in the grab I wanted to do the moves I can just try

4741
07:30:29,450 --> 07:30:37,389
to dodge backwards

4742
07:30:37,470 --> 07:31:00,939
I'm gonna try to parry it let's see what happens let's see if I can trigger him

4743
07:31:00,939 --> 07:31:14,209
to do it do it

4744
07:31:19,029 --> 07:32:19,020
waiting for him to do it Barry all right can't all right it's I can do

4745
07:32:19,020 --> 07:32:25,659
it all I can walk it all but in like game time scenario though that I guess

4746
07:32:25,659 --> 07:32:32,310
that's better than me dodging and fucking dying I feel like game time

4747
07:32:32,310 --> 07:32:44,939
scenario it's he does it so fast I should practice it right

4748
07:32:44,939 --> 07:33:20,180
I really want to crack at that it's worth it but man the timings are so odd

4749
07:33:20,180 --> 07:33:24,220
it's like here punch

4750
07:33:26,619 --> 07:33:43,740
that's just such odd timing okay how did I not get hit by that

4751
07:33:43,740 --> 07:34:03,979
the ultimate ultra hitbox got me that other time

4752
07:34:04,259 --> 07:34:21,040
this guy's rough I wonder I wonder what my official orphan of cost was the

4753
07:34:21,040 --> 07:34:26,090
hardest boss if ever played in a video game I wonder how many attempts

4754
07:34:30,180 --> 07:34:44,529
I wonder how many it's gonna take for this I remember when I I remember me and

4755
07:34:44,529 --> 07:34:51,130
star could not be orphaned together we tried dozens of times to be orphan

4756
07:34:51,330 --> 07:34:57,580
I finally did it by myself and it was like holy shit it's the

4757
07:34:57,580 --> 07:35:04,259
hardest thing but I'm starting to get that vibe of this might be that from

4758
07:35:04,259 --> 07:35:11,060
this game this guy's just so it's so easy to die he's got so many

4759
07:35:11,060 --> 07:35:17,450
interesting moves he's got three full ball bubbles this dude is no joke

4760
07:35:17,450 --> 07:35:31,849
and I definitely probably beat orphan by this without a doubt because this

4761
07:35:31,849 --> 07:36:06,250
has to be upwards of like 20 to 30 attempts on this guy right

4762
07:36:06,330 --> 07:36:12,060
three or just four swings there

4763
07:36:17,729 --> 07:36:29,450
mainly just use this practice down to try to block those four times it's a

4764
07:36:29,450 --> 07:36:32,729
sponginess that makes him this heart yeah he's got a dickload of health I

4765
07:36:32,729 --> 07:36:48,700
can do this three times I've also seen people say hey just get get the

4766
07:36:48,700 --> 07:36:54,340
flame I don't have it and like I have to go get an item that I don't

4767
07:36:54,900 --> 07:37:00,779
what I have with my I didn't get that item so I got a fight of the way that I

4768
07:37:00,779 --> 07:37:25,619
know how also I mean I got I'm gonna have to come back stronger this is this

4769
07:37:25,619 --> 07:37:29,180
is one of the hardest bosses in the game and I'm like eight hours what

4770
07:37:29,180 --> 07:37:36,020
seven hours eight hours playing the whole day I gotta come back fresh

4771
07:37:37,340 --> 07:37:57,619
because at some point you know you get used to get sloppy and this this

4772
07:37:57,619 --> 07:38:02,060
dude optional probably top three bosses in the game has to be top all right

4773
07:38:02,060 --> 07:38:07,750
I'll tell you I've how many bosses are after this guy they can't be more than

4774
07:38:07,750 --> 07:38:12,110
like it I'm almost I have to be at the end of the game I have to be nobody

4775
07:38:12,110 --> 07:38:17,799
gave me this much trouble I think I'm gonna I'm it's gonna be tricky for me

4776
07:38:17,799 --> 07:38:26,669
to do this now haven't even fought any of the bosses they're all still

4777
07:38:26,669 --> 07:38:37,930
alive practice it kind of all right

4778
07:38:37,930 --> 07:38:49,849
a little bit there and also maybe don't even be afraid to now the chip damn

4779
07:38:49,849 --> 07:39:40,150
just too much bye last one sucks ha ha ha fucking drive me crazy the issue

4780
07:39:40,150 --> 07:39:42,950
with this boss is that it's a Dark Souls boss in a game with a shitty

4781
07:39:42,950 --> 07:39:49,349
role yeah yeah that's true but technically can

4782
07:39:49,349 --> 07:39:55,229
parry everything that he does so it is like a Dark Souls I'm the like

4783
07:39:55,229 --> 07:40:02,240
cleric beast boss but it can be beaten by the tools they give you it's just

4784
07:40:02,240 --> 07:40:06,599
really hard to get yourself in that brain especially considering the

4785
07:40:06,599 --> 07:40:41,619
obvious that you want to fight this guy like Dark Souls boss that time I

4786
07:40:41,619 --> 07:40:47,529
still taking damage though so I took a lot of damage doing that I guess

4787
07:40:47,529 --> 07:41:06,950

4821
07:50:22,340 --> 07:50:28,290
I've been going for like eight hours of this game straight playing eight hours

4822
07:50:28,290 --> 07:50:34,479
straight as a hero is the equivalent of playing like pick Ross for two

4823
07:50:34,479 --> 07:50:41,849
weeks without turning it off and only eating three times there's like

4824
07:50:41,849 --> 07:50:49,490
playing minecraft on times five speed for three days straight but that's the

4825
07:50:49,490 --> 07:50:57,479
nature of the game gonna fuck I'm gonna be I'm gonna beat him eventually who is

4826
07:50:57,479 --> 07:51:13,729
this game for it's so funny it is so much to that comment but that's uh we'll

4827
07:51:13,729 --> 07:51:18,490
get what we did we defeated tonight we'll come back tomorrow stronger as

4828
07:51:18,490 --> 07:51:24,819
that's an obi-wan Kenobi said and then Darth Vader fucking lopped his

4829
07:51:24,819 --> 07:51:28,380
head off and he became a funny ghost for like three or four more episodes

4830
07:51:28,380 --> 07:51:43,659
so don't really use that as a good barometer have a great night guys I'll

4831
07:51:43,659 --> 07:51:46,740
see you tomorrow we're gonna try to get through this tomorrow tomorrow would

4832

4833
07:51:49,500 --> 07:51:54,119

4910
08:01:05,610 --> 08:01:08,290

like an hour or two a pick Ross and I'm gonna just like fucking slug in the

4914
08:01:18,810 --> 08:01:28,319
chair so depending on how long it takes tomorrow well it's not okay if I beat

4915
08:01:28,319 --> 08:01:31,430
the game in like an hour and a half I'm not just gonna turn off the

4916

going on then I totally understand I mean I would hate for somebody to be

4926
08:02:25,459 --> 08:02:29,259
excited about playing this game and then they click on the stream and they

4927

around in an old Volvo wearing your dressing gown in a pine park in vacant

4944
08:03:59,919 --> 08:04:08,630
parking lots while eating Big Macs and laugh at Garfield comics probably yeah

4945
08:04:08,630 --> 08:04:15,909
whole of one zombie thanks for the 250 and he says I kept this for some

4946
08:04:15,909 --> 08:04:32,479
reason what I don't understand why look at that first like look at the

4947
08:04:32,520 --> 08:04:37,279
okay stop it at like three or four frames in I've got like a people's

4950
08:04:57,619 --> 08:05:10,159
schwarzer rid for the five dolls haha you're so awkward ha ha but that

4951
08:05:10,159 --> 08:05:16,040
wasn't an ad that wasn't a ha ha that was just an ha ha that wasn't the

4952
08:05:16,040 --> 08:05:25,919
emote one that was just ha ha but thank you Schwartz hey effect tater thanks

4953
08:05:25,919 --> 08:05:30,689
to the ten bucks effect tater hey chat did you know that you can get 2500 bits

4954
08:05:30,689 --> 08:05:35,490
for $25 until the 31st twitch ain't taking any cuts from it so if you use

4955
08:05:35,490 --> 08:05:45,439
bits hop on it that's pretty cool wish it was that good of a deal

4956
08:05:45,439 --> 08:05:50,880
always that is the one thing that I really don't like about bits one

4957
08:05:50,880 --> 08:05:58,830
thing it's just if you buy less than like 20 30 dollars of bits it's

4958
08:05:58,869 --> 08:06:02,430
like it you have to pay like a 20 30 percent premium for like anything less

4959
08:06:02,430 --> 08:06:09,349
than five bucks that just shouldn't be like that I really don't in my opinion

4960
08:06:09,349 --> 08:06:16,560
I don't believe that that should be like that it's actually you're paying

4961
08:06:16,560 --> 08:06:20,830
money to pay money you know you get you pay it's it's like a it's like

4962
08:06:20,830 --> 08:06:30,990
currency trading a dollar is like a dollar thirty it's weird then allow

4963
08:06:30,990 --> 08:06:36,209
PayPal I don't want to do PayPal PayPal's messy donations of messy I

4964
08:06:36,209 --> 08:06:40,900
see so many horror stories so many people and like tax purposes it's

4965
08:06:40,900 --> 08:06:51,770
really hard to it's just strange you see these people that stream they get like

4966
08:06:51,770 --> 08:06:56,819
a $500 donation and they transfer the money to their bank account well they

4967
08:06:56,819 --> 08:07:00,340
use it and then there's a chargeback and they have to come up with 500

4968
08:07:00,340 --> 08:07:04,720
bucks and they may have already spent it so it's just I don't really I

4969
08:07:04,720 --> 08:07:09,020
don't want to even deal with it and then the idea is well just wait like

4970
08:07:09,020 --> 08:07:18,040
90 days so you can use the money no I'd rather just not have to worry

4971
08:07:18,040 --> 08:07:28,349
about it but I do wish it was a little less I don't I wish it wasn't 30% or 20

4972
08:07:28,349 --> 08:07:43,290
was a 28% for a dollar Bitcoin I tried Ethereum we don't talk about that

4973
08:07:43,290 --> 08:07:52,080
anymore remember when I had an Ethereum link down there two people

4974
08:07:52,080 --> 08:07:55,540
used it you can even go on you can go on the blockchain if you have that

4975
08:07:55,540 --> 08:08:00,779
old address go on the blockchain and see like the two or three people one

4976
08:08:00,779 --> 08:08:04,900
person gave me like four dollars and one person gave me like a dollar it

4977
08:08:04,939 --> 08:08:11,720
was there for months and months nobody used it so I just got rid of it and then

4978
08:08:11,720 --> 08:08:22,799
obviously the cryptocurrency took a nosedive that's very sweet of them yeah

4979
08:08:22,799 --> 08:08:27,080
it was cool it was cool to see like oh look that came in through like the

4980
08:08:27,080 --> 08:08:37,389
Ethereum blockchain that's so cool hey smelly boy thanks to the 250 you

4981
08:08:37,389 --> 08:08:40,150
took a fight from a fair but challenging boss fight that you were

4982
08:08:40,150 --> 08:08:44,069
getting better at each time to try and fight a bullshit many boss that

4983
08:08:44,069 --> 08:08:50,200
you knew would get you tilted no you took a break from a fair but

4984
08:08:50,200 --> 08:08:54,479
challenging boss fight that you're getting better at to fight the bullshit

4985
08:08:54,479 --> 08:09:04,040
mini boss and I killed him yeah but I was I really prepared for it though

4986
08:09:04,040 --> 08:09:09,090
during that I got the two snake hearts which I don't know what the hell to

4987
08:09:09,090 --> 08:09:11,770
do with those but I still have them and that's interesting got to see

4988
08:09:11,770 --> 08:09:16,650
that content right I wouldn't have probably done that and bless I went

4989
08:09:16,650 --> 08:09:20,450
if I had just beat that boss like let's say I spent like two three

4990
08:09:20,450 --> 08:09:25,849
hours straight while I was still not succumbing to gamer fatigue I was

4991
08:09:25,849 --> 08:09:29,090
still doing that and I beat eventually and I did it I wouldn't have seen the

4992
08:09:29,090 --> 08:09:36,380
snake stuff I would have kept going to the final part of the game so I'm glad

4993
08:09:36,380 --> 08:09:39,459
I got to I got some more beads I got some more items I got to see more stuff

4994
08:09:39,459 --> 08:09:48,159
but yes that did happen you're right show wars are read thanks for the

4995

5004
08:10:42,479 --> 08:10:52,840
guys because some of you guys are gonna ha ha me on that it's reddit it's like

5005
08:10:52,840 --> 08:10:57,479
one of the most viewed sites on earth that's like saying I checked Facebook

5006
08:10:57,479 --> 08:11:03,650
before the stream and it's like yeah Facebook really haha haha that's how it

5007
08:11:03,650 --> 08:11:12,380
goes right but I it's okay whatever don't let it get to you don't let it

5008
08:11:12,380 --> 08:11:20,610
get to you but thank you peek a banana for the five dollars I'm so

5009
08:11:20,610 --> 08:11:23,189
glad I was able to catch the tail end of the stream after missing most of it

5010
08:11:23,189 --> 08:11:29,529
looking forward to watching you beat the final boss term heart me too I'm

5011
08:11:29,529 --> 08:11:33,450
looking forward to it but I'm I'm I might be dragging the secure of

5012
08:11:33,450 --> 08:11:38,119
streams out a little bit maybe there's this one at the end and I you know

5013
08:11:38,119 --> 08:11:41,439
that gamer depression you guys know I'm talking about when there's a new

5014
08:11:41,439 --> 08:11:45,799
great insanely difficult fun title like this only comes around once every

5015
08:11:45,799 --> 08:11:50,419
three four years and I can see the tunnel the light at the end of the

5016
08:11:50,419 --> 08:11:57,779
tunnels there and I know it's gonna end and it I just I don't want it to end I

5017
08:11:57,779 --> 08:12:04,060
know it's going to and then when it's done that's it and that was fun it was

5018
08:12:04,060 --> 08:12:13,909
fun because a game like this there's not very many reasons to play it more

5019
08:12:13,909 --> 08:12:21,930
than a couple times because there's no character progression right but there's

5020
08:12:21,930 --> 08:12:25,330
no character oh I'm gonna use this weapon this time and they do this

5021
08:12:25,330 --> 08:12:32,990
build there's the skills but you can get most of them anyways that I think there

5022
08:12:32,990 --> 08:12:36,750
might be a couple of optional things you can do maybe with a second

5023
08:12:36,750 --> 08:12:43,549
playthrough no multiplayer so no PvP no PvP builds no building a character

5024
08:12:43,549 --> 08:12:49,040
and playing through the game again it's not there so with this one in

5025
08:12:49,040 --> 08:12:52,220
particular there's the replay abilities not there that much so it's

5026
08:12:52,220 --> 08:12:56,290
kind of hard to attempt to do like a second or third even play for

5027
08:12:56,290 --> 08:13:02,979
anyways so that's the sad part about the end of security is it really is

5028
08:13:02,979 --> 08:13:12,540
just the end of playing securo so I'm taking my time with it you know all good

5029
08:13:12,540 --> 08:13:17,169
things have to come to an end yeah that's true but this one comes to an

5030
08:13:17,169 --> 08:13:25,220
end much quicker than like for instance let's say Dark Souls 3 eyes for I saw

5031
08:13:25,220 --> 08:13:30,119
myself even when we did Dark Souls 3 and I got to the end I knew I knew it

5032
08:13:30,119 --> 08:13:33,599
immediately I was gonna play through with a sorcerer I was gonna play

5033
08:13:33,599 --> 08:13:38,000
through with a strength weapon I was gonna try to do PvP like I had like

5034
08:13:38,000 --> 08:13:40,560
at least three or four more reasons to play through the whole I played through

5035
08:13:40,560 --> 08:13:45,400
the game like three or four five times I'm not getting that I'm not gonna do

5036
08:13:45,400 --> 08:13:53,680
that again here I might play through this one more time to see if I missed

5037
08:13:53,680 --> 08:14:06,990
anything but I you know what I'm saying you got a full VOD to look

5038
08:14:06,990 --> 08:14:12,919
forward to okay well thank you oh you missed you missed some strange

5039
08:14:12,919 --> 08:14:20,380
stuff tonight I got taken I got possessed by fucking gamer demon I got

years maybe originally it was kind of like yeah I don't really yeah nobody

5065
08:17:54,880 --> 08:17:58,400
likes the sound of their own voice when it's playback and recording

08:19:51,720 --> 08:19:55,439
bosses on another note when's the next VR stream plan do you have a list

5083
08:19:55,439 --> 08:20:01,569
of games ready or you still looking for recommendations I have first of

5084
08:20:01,569 --> 08:20:09,099
all thank you secure oh is very very hard but as long as you can take

5085
08:20:09,139 --> 08:20:14,610
the pain you will push through eventually as long as you just relax you take a

5086
08:20:14,610 --> 08:20:19,959
break like for me right you guys just go you have to leave I can't just sit

5087
08:20:19,959 --> 08:20:24,419
there and fucking bash my head against the desk you got to come back you

5088
08:20:24,419 --> 08:20:28,400
got to leave and come back stronger take a break come back the next day

5089
08:20:28,400 --> 08:20:32,319
these are games that are not designed for you to beat in one sitting and

5090
08:20:32,319 --> 08:20:36,119
yes I know that there's people that play these games and they beat it in

5091
08:20:36,119 --> 08:20:40,000
like 45 minutes they're exceptionally talented video game players and they

5092
08:20:40,000 --> 08:20:46,319
are not even human with their reaction times and with their memorization but

5093
08:20:46,319 --> 08:21:00,009
that ain't me I don't claim to be that I do envy it sometimes because it's

5094
08:21:00,009 --> 08:21:04,389
remarkable what some of these guys are able to do but you got to take a

5095
08:21:04,389 --> 08:21:16,700
break here come back again those are real gamers yeah I know these it's

5096
08:21:16,700 --> 08:21:23,299
tough but okay it's like playing these from software games okay there's

5097
08:21:23,299 --> 08:21:29,259
gonna be like a Boy Scouts Sekiro badge I get I get to wear the Boy Scout

5098
08:21:29,259 --> 08:21:42,720
Sekiro badge when I get to the end right it's gonna be right next to you

5099
08:21:42,720 --> 08:21:48,029
ready here's I got like the whole thing here I got my flair Minecraft 4

5100
08:21:48,029 --> 08:21:54,060
Horseman in VR I got that one flame lurker first try that one's gold I

5101
08:21:54,060 --> 08:21:59,500
had that one embroidered beating Sekiro simply completing Sekiro that's

5102
08:21:59,500 --> 08:22:13,060
worth it doing the bonus round in point blank incredibly defied that's that

5103
08:22:13,060 --> 08:22:29,459
one's all that one's silver I wear these every day but for a moment these

5104
08:22:29,459 --> 08:22:32,340
these games are so popular within you know who's this game for right we

5105
08:22:32,340 --> 08:22:38,200
made that was funny and that that joke was was great or even if it wasn't a

5106
08:22:38,200 --> 08:22:43,080
joke when you eventually get to the end you do get to say I got to the

5107
08:22:43,080 --> 08:22:48,740
end and it was crazy it was fucking insanely difficult but I'm I did it I

5108
08:22:48,779 --> 08:22:55,459
made it they should have a t-shirt that you can buy only if you have a Steam

5109
08:22:55,459 --> 08:22:59,659
achievement that you completed the final encounter and it unlocks a t-shirt you

5110
08:22:59,659 --> 08:23:04,099
can buy that's like Sekiro got good right they would make so much money

5111
08:23:04,099 --> 08:23:15,700
think about the amount of people that would buy that shirt I got good and

5112
08:23:15,700 --> 08:23:18,860
it's like a cool design of Sekiro swinging his sword in a circle

5113
08:23:18,860 --> 08:23:29,470
do another hour of stream please no I'll be I'll be left tomorrow I'll be

5114
08:23:29,470 --> 08:23:34,930
like before you know it it's almost almost tomorrow anyways I got good at

5115
08:23:34,930 --> 08:23:39,520
Sekiro and all I got is this lousy t-shirt people would just put the

5116
08:23:39,520 --> 08:23:47,080
shirt on eBay it's not 1940 anymore grandpa everyone can make t-shirts

5117
08:23:47,080 --> 08:23:51,319

software this game I'm looking forward to tomorrow kind of I'm also not

5119
08:24:11,869 --> 08:24:15,509
looking forward to tomorrow it's like this weird angel and devil scenario I

5120
08:24:15,990 --> 08:24:21,509
have to beat the demon I have to and I could see the wall I'm looking up as

5121
08:24:21,509 --> 08:24:27,860
high and I could climb it I got to get good and get the t-shirt I'll be ready

5122

5123
08:24:30,819 --> 08:24:37,259

5128
08:24:58,159 --> 08:25:02,279
the end of the game or they don't want to see potentially somebody get the
